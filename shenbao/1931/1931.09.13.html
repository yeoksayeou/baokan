<p>時評</p>
<h3>（和平）（奮鬭）（救中國）</h3>
<p>（和平奮鬥救中國）七個大字。是孫中山先生彌留時昭示國人的遺訓。孫先生認爲欲救中國。必以（和平奮鬥）爲依歸。在今日内憂外患相逼而來。國步極爲艱難的時候。愈令國人感到孫先生遺訓之切要。彌留時艱苦呻吟發出的七字訓言。我們認爲在目前最是服膺於孫先生的人們所應切實體認切實遵行的時候。</p>
<p>目前天災人禍。内變外患。一時紛至的嚴重情勢。正所以試騐平時以救國救民爲己任者能否肩此重任。並試騐中國民族是否有自决心。我們在這大試騐之下所應取的態度。不是怕。不是消極。而在以積極的態度。革新的精神。</p>
<p>打破目前的難關。挽救中國。挽救中華民族。</p>
<p>救中國。救中華民族無他。第一是（和平。）第二是（奮鬥。）以和衷共濟的精神。共同作艱苦的奮鬥。孫先生最後的遺言。眞爲我們目前救國家救民族的不二法門。</p>
<p>爲什麽要和平呢。孫先生曾說。（中國現在時勢。尙在危險時代。如各自爲謀。不以國家爲前提。無論外人虎視耽耽。瓜分之禍。危在眉睫。即使人不我謀。而離心離德。亦難有成。）革命以來。變亂迭作。歲無寗日。幾年來離心離德所種的惡果。已足夠我們深慮長思。何况目前是洪水泛濫。哀鴻遍野。强鄰緊逼。待隙而動。國脈民命。不斷如絲。再不和平。不團結不一心一德。共策國是。其將何以自存呢。</p>
<p>爲什麽要奮鬥呢。和平是消極的團結。奮鬥才是積極的行動。中國人民日處於天災人禍交相熬煎的慘境。中華民族日處於國際帝國主義者共同宰制之下的次殖民地位。如何拯人民於水火。如何拯國家民族於危亡。有了消極的和平團結。尤須有積極的努力奮鬥。奮鬥是打破難關的惟一武器。是民族生存的重要條件如能以和平團結爲基礎。以共同奮鬥爲武器。就令目前環境萬分險惡。我們認爲奮鬥的鐵掌。斷然可以打破一切的艱難。</p>
<p>華盛頓曾經說過。（各部分聨合起來。不怕没有方法和能力去增强力量。增多方略。增大安全以抵抗外來的危險。）杜威也說。（大凡人類之文野强弱。皆可以樂羣與不樂羣爲其標準。苟富有羣性。聚千百萬人如一人。則文明程度必高國必强。斷不至受天然淘汰。苟割裂好爭。文明程度必低。國必弱。）這兩句話在當今外患逼來的時期中實在是一帖最好的對症良藥。</p>
<p>所以（和平）（奮鬥。）是救中國的惟一大道。而（澄清政治）（樹立綱常。）又是致和平致團結萬衆共同奮鬥的不二法門。尤其是在目前。我們應當切實體認（和平奮鬥救中國）七字的意義。並加以切實的遵行。</p>

<p>災民日見衆多</p>
<p>揚州通信、江北此次被水區域、其面積蔓延至十數縣之多、所决之口、雖經行政當局一再籌劃、但迄今半月、尙無即時堵塞方法、而災民日見其多、所募賑欵、大有供不應求之勢、秋風日急、疫癘滋生、盜賊蠭起、現狀堪虞、誠不知何以善其後、茲將此數日來險象分誌如下、</p>

<h3>水災與今後中國之水利問題</h3>
<p>沈怡</p>
<p>水災善後問題。固屬重要。但最要關鍵。還須國内有長時期之和平。蓋嚴格論之。此次水災。純係二十年來内爭之結果。並非偶然之事。讀者試思苟無内爭。各地水利何至廢棄若此。各地水利。苟不如此廢棄。縱遇水災。何至如此次之束手無策。夫立國於二十世紀。而猶年年閙水災。此在世界各國。本屬罕見之事。吾國猶以文明國自居者。不可不思有以雪此恥也。</p>
<p>余嘗發願研究黄河史料。爲黄河作一年表。以明其治亂之跡。因稍稍讀各種志書及吾國水利舊籍。而得一極有趣味之事實。即水利興　與歷代治亂之關係。實相互爲因果是也。例如唐代二百八十八年。河患三十二次。平均每九年有河患一次。元代一百零八年。河患九十一次。平均每一年餘有河患一次。唐元二代之政治。初不必由他方面比較。即此已可得其大概。蓋國家太平。當局者乃有餘力顧及水利。而水利益興。否則終年擾攘。雖有此心。亦無此力。由是以觀。民國以來水患之多。其原因能謂爲非由於内爭得乎。故欲去水患。惟有求國家之長保太平。庶幾建設事業。可以順序進行。如是而水利不興。水災仍迭出如今日者。其誰信之。</p>
<p>此次水災。政府雖不能防範於事先。然不可不努力補救於事後。而所謂事後之補救者。又不在一時之救災。而在今後災變之防止。在昔專制時代。設遇大水。則爲君主者。不免有罪己之舉。雖屬一番做作。然亦不可謂非負責之一種表示。地方長官於此、則必親自禱天。以助神庥。其事雖愚。其爲表示負責則一。此種表示方式。固不足爲訓。且亦非所語於今日。但政府對於此類事件之發生及其善後。必須引爲己責。則今昔初無二致。今日政府表示對水災負責。則今昔初無二於救災之外。努力防止今後之水災。防止今後水災之道無他。惟在平時之興修水利而已。語曰·前車之覆。後車之鑒。又曰·往者不可追。來者猶可及。其此之謂乎。</p>
<p>此次大水。據報紙記載。以揚子江流域爲最烈。次則江北一帶。水災亦不小。查揚子江向係著名有利無害之河流。但證諸近年情形。則大不然。即以漢口至吳淞一段而論。每值冬春之季。水勢淤淺。吃水稍深之輪舶。往往祇逹蕪湖爲止。蕪湖以上。即須改用駁船。裝運貨物。其受病之深。已非一朝一夕。至如此次武漢之大水。則更屬駭人聽聞。考其原因。不外近年水利不修。幹支日就淤淺。諸湖受水之區。其洲渚復被私人紛紛侵佔。以致水無所容。横决爲災。加以本年七八月間。各地雨量之多。面積之廣。異乎尋常。上游又無森林及相當工事。水勢急流直下奔騰汜濫。莫可抵禦。武漢三鎭適當江漢之衝。支幹同時並漲。縱隄防如何堅固。恐在此種情形之下。大水仍可漫隄而過。况其本身原甚薄弱者耶。按揚子江中流一段。湖澤甚多。如洞庭鄱陽諸湖。平日皆湖面浩　。河流縱横。每遇江水盛漲。則瀦水湖中。水勢得以减殺。水落·復將積存之水。漸漸瀉出。使水源不　枯寂。故其水量之增减。每隨江水之漲落爲轉移。不啻揚子江之天然蓄水池。向日揚子江之得免汜濫。此其最大原因。惜自前清末年以來。各省紛紛沙田局。不問水道之影響何若。專以發部照賣水地爲能事。其工作旣與水利機關各不相謀。目的又完全相反。如是而欲求水災之不作。誠有　言者矣。夫治水之事。如醫病然。必須詳細審察。非可臆度。故如何治理今後之揚子江。當百目前數言所能决。惟就原則立論。則揚子江本身及所有支流。必須分别加以疏浚。沿江江岸舉隄防。必須分别加以修理與保護。平日蓄水諸湖。必須恢復其固有之功能。換言之。即侵佔之地。無論是否合法取得。凡與治理計劃相抵觸者。均應盡還諸水。此外則沙田局之事務。應移歸主管之水利機關辦理。以期工作之不相矛盾。後者不獨於治理揚子江爲然。任何地方具有此等情形者。均有設法糾正之必要也。此次水災發生以後。曾有人提及昔日張季直先生之一言、其意若謂導淮苟無成。將來武漢必有陸沉之一日。不幸今日其言竟騐。不可謂非巧事。於是有歎息於淮水之未服早治者。又有人以爲導淮之議。倡之已久。入江入海聚訟紛紜。亦非一日。苟照最近導淮委員會所定計劃。則係偏重人江。今江水爲患若此。若再益以淮水。詎非變本加厲。然則由此次水災經騐。尙可及其未導。令人對於該計劃充分研究考量。未始非一大幸事以鄙意度之。張季直先生倘有此語。當係指導淮入海而言、意謂淮不入海。必入於江。一旦江淮並漲。江水受淮頂托。其勢必大。則武漢危矣。然以余所知。此次武漢大水。並不足爲淮水罪。而導淮入江之舉。倘已見諸事實。則此次南京一帶。當不致如今日之湮水。即江北方面之水災。亦不致如今日之甚。是則余所敢斷言。此言驟聞之似不成理。實則淮水不等。則其大部分之洪水量。舍入江外。别無其他消納之路。及其旣導。則洪澤湖旣可蓄淮河洪水之一部分。入海又分去　部分。如是則大水時入江之水量。反可遠遜於往日。今人不加細察、聞導淮計劃主張先整理入江之路。即紛紛以爲不可。不知入江之路縱不整理。淮水固日日入江。毫無限制。入江之量。甚且佔淮水之極大部分。今日淮水之爲患。其故即在此。姑謂導淮入江。必須反對。然則不導而入江。未聞有人加以注意。寗非怪事。或曰·此所以主張導淮入海也。余意導淮入海。在工程上固無不可。所欲研究者。是否經濟。是否爲今日國力之所能勝耳。按導淮委員會計劃。本於導淮入江以外。兼籌入海。並利用洪澤湖寫攔洪水庫。以限制大水時淮水之入江流量。使長江之洪水位。不致因此感受影響。倘以上理想。事實一均能一一實現。則該計劃非特不宜因此次大水而受摇動。且將因此而更有速謀實現之必要。</p>
<p>雖然。導淮豈易言哉。導淮而置黄河於不顧。是直與不導等耳。余於二年前嘗草導淮與治黄一文載諸各報。歷述黄淮關係之密切。及黄河現狀之危險。以爲今日不欲導淮則已。欲導淮必先治黄。未有黄不治而　可以苟安者也。惟是蘇皖人士。平素有一極錯誤之見解。即誤以爲黄河自咸豐五年北行奪濟人海以後。不復有南侵之可能。山陽丁顯。似曾一度爲此說。惟據余推測。丁顯爲主張導淮最力之一人。當時目覩黄河北去。認爲此乃導淮惟一之良機。但河淮合流時肇禍之烈。沿淮人士。記憶尙新。苟不設法消滅其心理上之疑懼。則導淮之阻力。正復不少。以是有意發爲黄河北去不復南來之說。此蓋丁顯之故弄狡獪。以丁氏之聰明才識。寗不知黄河侵淮之頻。旣能北行於前。何不可南返於後。今人不察。尙有信以爲眞者。詎不大可歎乎。當明清之世。河淮合流。治河者若陳瑄潘季馴劉大夏靳輔輩。或築高堰。或建太行堤。或創束水堤於雲梯關外、茲數人者。見非不廣。謀非不周。乃一旦河水北决。全功盡廢。則今日縱欲埋頭言導淮。即令淮固得導。安能保黄河之不南侵。昔人云·治百里之河者。目光應及千里之外。治目前之河者。推算應在百年以後。此之謂矣。自黄河北行奪濟人海。濟之受病。已與以前奪淮時淮之受病相等。年近决口之事。往往發生於山東一帶。足證尾閭之不暢。已逹極點。長此以往。尾閭愈不暢。水愈無去路。其勢必横决。則咸豐五年銅瓦廂之往事。難免不重演於今日。吾但願吾言之弗中。否則將來爲患之烈。恐决不在此次大水之下。吾非好作危言。殷鑒俱在。欲諱不能。獨不解舉國人士。何以對於其他河流。尙知注意。獨於黄河則如此漠視。其將待變生而後言治乎。誠非吾所忍知矣。彼應廳聘來華之利專家如費禮門·如方修斯·如美國紅十字會工程團。其來也。均爲導淮。但讀其報告。則字裏行間。莫不視治黄較導淮爲尤急。費禮門於其所著之治淮計劃書中有曰。（著者始終以拯救中國大患之黄河。爲胸次惟一之事）。美國紅十字會工程團導淮報告中。則有下列之聲明曰。（黄淮兩水之復行合併。或爲事實上能有之事。若然。則所有工程。將悉被其毁棄·因此之故。工程團深以此次報告若於黄淮之關係。不詳加研究。則尙不得稱爲完全）。最近導淮委員會顧問德人方修斯敎授。在其所著報告中。亦有（與導淮關係最密切者。厥惟黄河問題。黄河若復决而南。則導淮將全功盡棄）之語。嗟乎。黄河若南决。其勢必挾淮水以入江。豈僅導淮將全功盡棄。即今後治理揚子江及其他一切水災善後問題。亦將愈趨複雜。心所謂危。不敢弗盡。願國人之關心水利者。於奔走救災之餘。一覽敎之。</p>

<p>▲張會長訓詞各位指導員·各位來賓·男女運動員·本市全市運動會曾於上年三月間、舉行一次茲復舉行第二屆全市運動會、並照章於會中選拔二十年全國運動大會本市代表、今日爲運動會開幕之期、際此天高氣爽、大好秋光、正可及時而試、至於參加運動者之踴躍爭先、一般觀衆之懽忻鼓舞、在在足以證明市民注意體育之熱誠、較之第一屆運動、已有顯著之進步、將來競賽時、必更有許多新紀錄、此種良好現象、殊可慶幸、本市長猶有不能已於言者、凡三點</p>
<p>一、應注重精神方面我民族精神喪失久矣、近年來力救振作、始知欲恢復民族精神、必自注重體育始、於是各省市運動會及全國運動大會、次第舉行雖各有相當成績、但是精神方面、猶未逹到充分圓滿程度、故每逢天災人禍外患内憂之際、總不能以整個民族精神制止之融化之使永不再見於青天白日之下、雖然此充分圓滿之整個民族精神、本非一蹴可幾自非、脚踏實地、一步步邁往前進、不足以收最後之成功、所望此次與會各員、發奮爲雄、各顯身手對於每一運動先不問、其結果如何、决不中途退縮、務須貫澈主張、始終不懈如此方可造成新紀錄、以發揚我民族精神、將來更推此精神、以救國民救世界救人類、方能做出一番新事業、</p>
<p>二、應注重道德方面運動會首應注重精神、但是道德方面、亦不可怱略、尤其要融合精神、於道德之中、在我國古時有習射一門、揖讓雍容、進退有禮、絕對不容有絲毫機詐攘奪之心、現在運動會亦與古時習射用意相同、性質雖屬競賽目的、仍在運動、與會各員、固不免存爭先競勝之心、但不可有損人利己之事、均應遵守會章、服從號令、凡有越軌舉動及不道德的行爲、均爲全會所共棄、更有在此盛大會場參加人數旣處、關於會場秩序、亦應加以注意、以上所述、果能彼此了解、結果當然圓滿、</p>
<p>三、應注重技能方面運動會宗旨、固在競賽技能、但於精神道德方面或有欠缺、即失運動會之本意是以先精神、次道德、最後方始講到技能、希望與會各員將上次運動會情形反省一下在積極方面、對於上次所有的成績、當然要更求進步、而在消極方面、以前所有的缺點統共不使其再有發生、而尤要者競賽結果、即有優劣之分、其優勝者不可自滿、還要精益求精、預備將來參加全國運動會、以爲全市爭光榮、其未能獲得優勝者亦不必因失望而灰心、失敗爲成功之母、依然要繼續努力、倘使技能果精、自不患不出人頭地、</p>
<p>以上三端、凡與會各員均應切實注意、再有業餘運動本府所屬各機關各職員多數參加、將來成績如何、雖不能預料、但此種勇敢精神、實可表現其運動興味之熱烈、本市爲對之、尤有厚望焉</p>
<h3>整隊游行</h3>
<p>市黨部代表童行白馴詞會長各運動員各來賓各代表、今日兄弟代表市黨部參加上海二屆全市運動會、很覺愈快、關於運動會中重要之點、張市長言之綦詳、無待發述、兄弟所欲貢獻的、不過細微的幾點、（一）運動要普遍、不要局於一部、通常運動會中、參加比賽者、都屬學校學生、而學生之中、又估全校的少數蓋小學中之愛好運動者、有人中學而中斷了、中學中之愛好運動者、有入大學而中斷了大學中之愛好運動者、有至社會服務而中斷了、這樣情形、要體育的普及、豈不很難、我現在很希望運動具有根蒂的諸君把他發揮而推廣之、（二）運動要持久不要暫時往往有許多運動員、將屆運動會期、努力練習、過了運動會、即淡然置之所以對於身體上的鍛鍊、精神上的修養、裨益很少、吾希望諸位於會後不論勝敗、繼續練習關於上述二點、均爲諸君所習知、其不憚辭費者、意欲請大家永矢不忘罷了、</p>
<p>▲褚民誼演詞會長指導運動員來賓兄弟新自新　回來得與盛會、於心滋　、在此天災人禍交迫的中國、很有些人想把運動會展期理由也很充足、但鍛鍊身體、發揚民氣實爲中國今日之要著中國一般人的身體、似乎太差了所以遇事少進取的心思、外人贈病夫的徽　倘能從運動中尋條出路、改造體魄、成就健全的個人、才可爲黨國服務即如兄弟遠至西北經行萬里、而得安然歸來者、也得力於平日的鍛鍊</p>

<p>陳需懷劉順俠董松美</p>
<p>范良</p>
<p>裁判員唐仲光</p>
<p>此賽蓓蕾應作棄權論、因人數不齊、臨時拉人凑數、裁判員直至　後方才發見、幸華伶得勝、否則又是問題矣、蓓蕾結果仍完全一而倒、九十分鐘、皆處重壓之下、五步之内、並非敵踪、華伶横掃一時、先十五分鐘、華伶中鋒賈季良即中一球、後蓓蕾得機反攻、華伶左衝鄭志榮犯規、蓓蕾中鋒王克祖踼入一球、左内鋒羅斗文得吳九臯來球、攻入成二比二、蓓蕾内衛犯規、賈幼良踼中十二碼、劉宗德吳九臯亦各中一球、五比一終了、</p>

<p>此組興味較上一組大增、球亦輕快、不若上組之呆、完全一面而倒、知行爲上屆中華足球會華字組冠軍、雖有缺席者、軍容仍雄壯、西區雖不敵、然抵抗極烈、上半時二比○知行得二球、左内鋒萬冕單槍匹馬、一直破關、只開賽十分鐘、繼而中鋒龔以斌在離球門二十碼地、向左一鈎、竟然中的、美妙非凡、下半時二十分鐘無勝負、西區進攻至球門前、作軍混亂之際、中堅張錦祥仆地觸球、西區遂以十二碼、挽回一球、最後知行右内鋒方朝俊、得萬象華來球、不勞而獲第四球、三比一終</p>

<h3>跳遠决賽</h3>
<p>跳遠决賽、四十三人中、臨賽不到者多至十三人、此種精神、殊爲欠佳、　此種情形以後不要再發現於本市各運動會中　昨日跳遠决賽、猶差强人意得位置之四人均跳過六米、王季淮以六米二十二得第一、李琳亦跳至六米二十、以成績論、雖不能云佳、但在新近修理、疏鬆之跑道上、有此成績、實非易易、董中華田徑塲自前次大雨積水後、田賽塲之各種跑道均呈　低不平、於一星期前雇工修理將原有跑道　鬆、增加煤屑、雖時加滚壓然尙不能應用、今日一級跳如仍在原處舉行、成績不佳當可預測、希塲地股從速設法可將上面疏鬆者把去一薄層、再加滚壓、以冀今日之三級跳、與明後日之五十項跳遠均有良好成績昨日之跳遠、在預賽第三次試跳時、鍾連基與李琳之成績均爲五米九十一名列第六、於鍾李一君作第四次試跳、以奪參加决賽之權、結果李君吉星高照、壓倒鍾君而得决賽權、并亦因之而奪得亞軍並在决賽之第三試跳時、曾一度以　米二十之成績超過王季淮、而領導　流、但第二試跳時、王君開足馬逹、一躍造成六米三十二之成績後李君以跳高亦在緊要關頭遂放棄跳遠專意於跳高、王君遂於平穩中奪得錦標、郝春德董兆斌名列第三第四、李琳則屈居第二、但以記者之眼光王季淮與李琳俱非跳遠之特色人才、王君身體太重、練習擲重較爲合宜、深恐再隔一二年、身體發胖不能保持現在狀態、李君身才過小彈力雖佳、吃虧不少實難有特殊成績但李君　能放棄一切、專練撑竿跳則撑竿跳之成績定有長進、不知王李二君以爲然否、</p>
<h3>鐵餅决賽之優勝者</h3>
<p>（自左至右）第一王季淮第二羅傳賢第三陳若虚第四唐賢輈</p>
<p>光攝</p>
<h3>鐵餅决賽</h3>
<p>鐵餅一項、在上海一偶、進步甚遲、於昨日本報已略言之矣觀昨日之决賽已足證實記者之言非虚、於若大規模之運動會中、擲過三十米者僅二人其餘大部份成績均在二十五米左右甚致有二十二米者竊以爲怪事雖預料成績不得十分優良然其平均成績其幼稚何若是之甚也、記者百思不得其故、乃就詢奪得是項第一之王季淮君據王君云（鐵餅與標槍其成績進步、所以較遲者、其故蓋在練習鐵餅與標槍須有極大之塲地、目練習時須有同伴帮助否則擲去擲來頗費周折因此不論在學校在社會、練習是類運動者較少、因之進步遲緩、此種情形、非特上海、此中國何處不然至於今日鐵餅之成績平均特别較勞者、亦關暑假甫過、開學未及旬日大多數運動員、均缺少練習、兼以逆風抛擲有以使然）　者聞王君之言恍然而悟、查昨日之比賽點名册上本有二十三人、臨塲缺席者五人、在預賽三次中、王季淮君即以三十米八十名列第一羅傳賢君以二十一生的米突之差名列　二、再次爲符伯明、唐賢翰·謝全和·曹裕等在三次决賽中其餘各子均一無進展僅王季淮在第六次一擲得三十二米零六三成績比賽亦從此終了、</p>
<h3>女子跳高决賽</h3>
<p>昨日之女子跳高决賽、其中　饒興味者、即朱文誠孫曉霞李實惠、三女士爭跳　三名、加高放下、競爭頗劇烈、結果李女士先行出局、朱孫二女士仍繼續試跳、結果朱女士奪得四組、已用盡力量矣、總計朱孫女爲爭取　四名、共跳十一次之多、可想當時競爭之情形矣、</p>
<h3>女子跳遠决賽</h3>
<p>在十四位女健將决賽跳遠中、居然能　疏鬆之跑道上、有三人跳至四米以上、寗非喜事、跳至三米八十以上者亦復不少、足　數月中女子跳遠一項確有進步、其中最有把握者、爲錢行素女士、除第一次試跳跳三米九十九以外其餘五次、均跳四米以上、在第三次試跳、以四米三十六之成績、打倒張蘋先、於上半年中校運動會中新造四米三十之上海最高紀錄、名列第一、張蘋先女士似有退步、雖在决賽三次中、均跳至四米以上、但其最佳成績、爲四米二十、較上次成績、相差十生的米突、不知是否以暑期中缺少練習之故顯此退步現象、希張女士努力、預備全運動會時、再造新紀錄、爲本　爭光</p>
<h3>各項預複賽</h3>
<p>昨日男女各項預賽複賽、共有四十餘組、中以發令槍機件損壞屢放、嚮减煞風景、然各運動員之精神、仍不因之而稍减、但有數事、不能已於言者敢爲一道之、</p>
<p>一、發啣姿勢有一部份運動員、連發脚姿勢、尙未曾習熟、手也脚也令人望之發笑、雖加入運動、其志可嘉但亦應審自己之程度、究有無姿格在如此規模之全市運動會中比賽、否則上海百多萬成年人中、有百分之一加入運動、則運動會將連續開一兩個月、</p>
<p>二、跑鞋短跑非有跑鞋、雖上天本靈、亦不能有特殊成績、但在昨日男子百米與二百米預賽中、有二人一穿皮鞋、一穿橡皮鞋、實屬可笑至極穿布鞋等賽跑於身體之效用周屬相同相在堂堂之全市運動會中穿布鞋來會參預短跑比賽、實有失觀瞻</p>
<p>三缺席在昨日餘賽三十餘組中、缺席者多至一百三十餘人、令人昨舌或云此係報名時不收報名費之故、不知是乎否也、記者不知、</p>
<p>花花絮絮</p>
<p>炎威已退、金風乍起、人人精神百倍、個個喜氣十足、勞神父路上車水馬龍、運動場中萬頭攢動、此昨日全　運動會之盛况也、各項比賽成績、咸有專欄記載　　切零星雜碎、苦無門類可歸、祇得另闢一欄名曰花花絮絮、拉　寫來、無分彼此前後、東拚西凑、但求熱閙而已、</p>
<p>▲居高臨下臺的集合全場共有四臺、司令臺·音　臺·各股辦事臺·及救護臺是也、四臺連合一起比鄰而居、一臺之旁、又是一臺、可謂之臺的集合拾級登臺、全塲在望、秋風指袂、身心舒　故四臺實爲全塲之最好瞭望處因之看客中之不能上臺、而望臺興嘆者、大有人在、臺下通道兩端、均纜以鐵絲網、另闢小門出入、門外有兩華捕司閽、然不知者仍多叩關欲入、臺上生活之令人羨慕、亦可異已、</p>
<p>司令臺上銀光燦爛司令臺係茅竹蘆席所搭蓋、高爽　快、表裏通風、居高臨下、飄飄欲仙、所有此次比賽、各界贈送之獎品、均堆置臺上、盾屏杯幛、銀光燦爛、排列整齊、井井有序、遠望之、但見閃閃之光、時時照人眼簾、閉會前一句鐘紛紛由員役搬走場中多少健兒、其目逆而送者、心中定有此物不知將落入誰手之想也、</p>
<p>▲大呼（童子軍注意）司令臺前設有電氣播音機、擴音啦叭兩隻、分列左右、臺上發號司令、雖遠立者亦能聽之清晣、發令員邵驥、嗓子響亮態度雍穆、聲高呼、萬衆響應、而（童子軍注意一語、尤爲口頭常談、每當比賽開始、輒聞擴音器中、廣播其音曰（童子軍注意、要檢查看客、不要呌他們走入塲中、）而有時則大呼（童子軍是維持秩序的、平是來看比賽的、）此則似略帶興奮作用矣、</p>
<p>▲女運動員服裝一瞥昨日參加比賽之女運動員、數亦不少、服裝顔色、各有不同、其中以東亞體專之紫羅藍色上裝、及兩江女校之緑色短褲、最爲鮮艶悅目、務本運動員上裝作白色、下着海軍藍色之短褲、曁南女生服裝與務本相彷彿、惟褲藍色較深耳、兩江之緑褲、上要鑲以白色條紋、賽跑時、此白條紋乃浮動不已、</p>
<p>▲一個麵包兩人分昨日在塲服務之童子軍、數約百餘人兩江及上海中學男女除員各半事勞人少、精神極佳、惟全塲看客衆多維持秩序、亦非易易、其勞蹟固甚可嘉也時至下午、辦事員分發麵包週遊塲中、大呼麵包不已、呼聲未已、長方麵包即從空中飛來、一女童子軍接得麵包方欲劈食辦事員又大呼曰（一個麵包兩人分）於是此女童子軍、乃不得不與其同伴、作秋色之平分矣、</p>
<p>▲攝影員大吃塵土全場攝影者不下十餘人往來奔馳亦頗忙碌但女子跳遠比賽時、大多席地而坐環沙池作半月形、每一女運動員奔跳而來攝影者即俯首撳紐拍拍之聲隱約耳際待此賽完畢時、無不大呼（吃餐塵土）不已、蓋當女運動員跳入沙中時、每次必帶起若干沙土也</p>
<p>▲動歟不動歟跳遠比賽完竟後、各攝影者均要求爲三一六·三四八·三四六號等女運動員攝影、三女　人乃挽臂並立於鏡箱包　中、屏息弗動、以待拍攝、此時有攝取活動影片者亦在人業中、大摇其開末拉、顧拍呆片者口中常呼（不要動、）而攝活動影片者則大呼（動動）不已聞者乃不覺大笑、</p>
<p>▲看客大喊光郎頭男子田徑賽跳高比賽中、有三十五號陳天和者、係商船學生、跳高之成績甚佳、惟此君頭部光光、與人略異、看台上觀衆乃不呼其號碼、而大喊（光郎頭）不已、每當緊要關頭、（光郎頭）之呼聲乃不絕於耳、而聞者亦爲之忍俊不已、</p>
<p>▲海星關心交大下午四時、交大與滬江比賽排球、雙方勢均力敵、攻守有方不相上下、觀客精神爲大振、惟旁觀者之中、以海星於交大最爲關心、每當交大失敗、海號女隊員輒爲之惋借而已、一聲（啊哟）悠然意遠、若　遇勝利之處、則又揮手舞足、歡呼不已、而觀衆經海星一喊、亦大現愉快之象、</p>

<p>▲實力太懸殊德孚來滬未久、而聲譽大著、技術之佳、不問可知、渠之雙打、最係拿手欄門功夫、尤有獨到之處、同伴特克海上第一流英國網球家、互相合作、精彩百出、日本大將俵積雄未參加、出場之永松岡氏實非全才、兩相比較、高下懸殊、開賽之後、立顯强弱、　國連勝兩盤又兩局、（共計十四局）彷彿如一場春夢、勝者負者、以及觀者、均有莫名其妙之慨、研其實、技藝相差太遠也、</p>

<h3>路市展覽會昨行開禮幕</h3>
<p>來賓均有熱烈之演辭</p>
<p>中國第一次路市展覽會、於昨日上午十時、在法租界貝當路新建會塲内、舉行開幕典禮、除國府蔣主席委派上海市長張岳軍代表出席參加外、外交部長王正廷、實業部長孔祥熙等、均親自到塲致詞、茲將昨日情形、分誌於後、</p>
<p>▲到會之來賓到會者計有蔣主席代表張羣外交部長王正廷·實業部長孔祥熙·次長趙晉卿·中央委員褚民誼·勞働大學校長王景歧·外交部駐滬辦事處處長楊念祖·古巴公使庇德賴將軍·捷克代表費哲爾·及中華全國道路建設協會委員·與各省代表以及中外各界男女來賓等數千人、</p>
<p>▲行禮時情形於上午十時二十分、宣布開會、由趙晉卿主席、楊念祖司儀、行禮後、首由會長王正廷致詞、蔣主席代表張市長致詞、實業部長孔祥熙·美國汽車商會代表鮑爾·及中央委員褚民誼演說畢、最後即由曹雲祥代表主席答詞、然後攝影、茶點而散、</p>
<p>▲王正廷致詞略謂、各位來賓、本會委員會、今天在此開路市展覽會、蒙黨國要人、中外耆紳、光臨指敎、這是我國道路建設協會、非常榮幸、道路協會、自成立以來、一直到現在、已有十年歷史、在十年中、環境非常艱難困苦、然得諸委員之努力、全國同胞之注意、及國外朋友海外僑胞之援助、所以在十年中、雖然艱難困苦、實在還是非常可慰的一回事、兄弟覺得滿清時代、對於鐵路、非常重視、然而當時有一般人、只知注意鐵道、對於道路、則視爲無關重要、須知鐵路固然是應當有的、還要有道路來輔助、否則、鐵路何由而發逹呢、總理對於交通事情、各方都顧到、總理計畫是要全國築十萬公里鐵路、和一百萬公里的道路、其他關於運河之如何疏濬、及電話無線電電台等、這種對於交通各方面、都有密切之關係、因爲交通不便、任何事業、都受阻碍、商業工業農業、無論任何事業、要想發逹、是很不容易、因此之故、是以總理對於交通方面、是十分注意的、所以現在世界上、那一國道路最多、那一國的人民最有幸福、凡是市鎭繁盛之區域、無不是受道路交通便利之賜、道路經過　一處、這處地方、就馬上繁盛起來、我們要把東北西北西南各處繁盛起來、非用道路去協助鐵路不可、這是很明顯的事實、且西北西南各省、現在皆是很窮苦的省份、假使從前能够多築道路、現在决計不會那樣窮苦、從這各方面看起來、道路之重要、可想而知、至於建築方面、鐵路之建設、是不甚容易·而道路則隨處隨地、都可以建築、且築路在經濟方面、比鐵路相差甚遠、其收效則相同、没有道路的地方、人民之壽命、無形被其縮短、譬如在上海地方、交通便利、幾十里的路、因爲道路整齊平坦、得駕駛汽車電車、而頃刻逹到目的地、如果在没有道路、或有道路而崎嶇不平的地方步行、費力旣多、而時間上亦必耗去不少的寳貴光陰、即使可以用馬車或是其他可以代步的車、一天功夫、也走不了多少路、在没有道路的地方、其艱難有如是、在有道路的地方、其便利又如此、則道路之於國家個人、莫不有切身利害的關係、均可從而知之、我國是以縣爲單位、如果每縣都能够竭力的築路、預料不必過多少日子、國家一定、也可以增加富强、而將來要週游全國有了平坦道路之後、只用汽車數天、就可以辦到、最近如威海衛、自接收之後、就用一種互助之法來築路、因當地政府、鑒於農民在冬天没有事情做、而下午工作、則未有開始、就召集了許多農民、給以器具材料、呌他們去築路、人民出工力、政府供給材料、現在的威海衛、交通極爲便利、就是這個效果、所以總理認爲道路、是民生重要問題之一、故在衣食住三項要素之下、加一行字、其意亦係如是、至於政府與人民結合最密切的、要算是市政府與縣政府、如果市政與縣政辦得腐敗、人民是直接要受其害、而築路工程、尤應自縣始、然後一步一步的做去、中國的道路、自有成績可觀了、至於今天開會的意思、一方是表示敬意、一方還要請各界積極的援助、</p>
<p>▲主席歡迎詞略稱、道路協會成立至今、已有十年以上之歷史、過去工作、所收效果、想到會諸君、已有相當嘹解、無庸鄙人贅述、蓋以凡百事業之建設、莫不有賴於交通事業之輔佐、道路之唯一目的、即在鼓吹全國交通事業之發展、計畫交通事業之建設、因交通事業之於國家、猶血脈之於人身、血脈流通則身體康健·交通便利、則國家健全、如其交通不便、亦必繁榮之區、過度繁榮、偏僻之區、終於閉塞、各項產業、無由開發、該會十年以來、奔走號呼、頗引起一般民衆之同情、然尙未能十分深切注意、此次展覽會之設、即在使一般民衆、了然於交通事業之重要、俾今後之交通事業、得有長足之進步今年中國水災奇重、被災之地、有十七省、被災之民、有八千萬、此後之衣食住行、無一不賴於交通事業之救濟即以糧食而論、我國東省方　、頗有剩餘大豆、因生產過多、國外銷路不振、在交通不便之區往往用作燃料、而我國長江流域之災民、飢不得食、反向美國借麥、可謂不經濟之至、假使交通便利、則東省有餘之糧、即可運給飢民、亦何須抑給外人、中國物產豐富、均以交通不便、無法運出、譬如國煤、產量甚多、因運輸機關不足、運輸能力薄弱致上海工廠、所用之煤、均抑給於日本、而爲日人所操縱、更如鐵道枕木、曩昔實業部爲提倡國貨起見、曾建議改用國產、但後經鐵道部詳細調查、始知購用外國枕木僅費銀二兩餘、若用國產、所費價格、必在三四倍以上、推其原因、由於國内築鐵路太少、運輸不便、輾轉輸送、所費實多、諸如此類事實、不勝枚舉、此則可爲痛心者也、最足奇者、假使吾人欲將蒙古新疆西藏等處貨物、運入内地、非假手於外國交通機關不可、尤覺痛心、最近俄人建築鐵道近我新疆、以其交通之價值論、俄人頗不合算、但以政治上之關係、俄人仍積極建此道路、從南京到新疆非數十日不可、從西伯利亞到新疆、僅須八日、我國若不從速便利該處交通、新疆恐非我所有、是以建築道路、無論其在經濟上·政治上·國防上·均有重大之意義、孫總理十萬鐵道之計畫可謂高瞻遠矚、本會即秉承先總理之主張、而繼續進行者也、再則此次水災、亦由交通不便之故、損失較大死亡較多、今後糧食之供給、衣被之供給、農業種子、及農具之供給、在在猶需要大量之運輸、所以從各方看來、道路建設、實屬刻不容緩、中國今日最大之病源是貧、貧的根源、是產業未能開發、古人謂利棄於地、而不知闢、但照鄙人看來、並非不知闢因爲交通不便之故、無法可闢、即使將各項地利開闢出來、没有交通利器、將他運送出去、亦屬等於廢物、現在商人日日感覺運輸能力不足、日日向交通當局呼籲、所以鄙人盼望大家起來、開闢道路、建築道路、因爲築路爲產業開發的前提、產業開發的利器、有交通始有產業、此乃鄙人所敢斷言也云云、</p>
<p>▲張市長致詞（此係市長交發原稿）略謂、今天是全國道路協會所舉辦的路市展覽會開幕的日子、兄弟奉國府主席命令、代表前來參加、不勝榮幸、在我們辦市政的人看起來、而政的建設、在物質方面、道路的修築、是最要緊的建設、就地方自治的實施而言、修築道路、與調查戶口、測量土地辦理警衛、是同樣的重要、總理在民生主義裏面、於衣食住以外、特别標出一個（行）字、和衣食住三問題並列、而且在建國方略實業計劃中、第一就先提出交通之開發問題、認爲交通是發展實業的唯一工具、所以然者、因爲交通一經振興、不僅軍事政治文化各方面、很</p>
<p>多的困難問題、都可以解决、實業也可以振興、所以一個國家要富强、要建設、非集中其精神物質、在這個途徑上特别努力不可、吾人今日談中國之建設、亦非特别注意及此不可、這是就積極方面講的、即從消極方面講、就如今年的大水災、因水災而死的民衆、不知幾何、其流離失所的、更不容易統計、水災固然是不可抗力、然假令道路交通若能比較現狀發逹、民衆亦不致坐以待斃、現在我們因爲各種交通之不健全、不能採用一種敏捷妥善辦法、去救濟他們出險、這大</p>
<h3>路市展覽大會攝影（本館攝）</h3>
<p>是一種異常可悲痛的事嗎、由上說時、可知交通問題、在積極方面、影響國家之建設甚大、而在消極方面乃致影響於我國民族之生存、眞是萬難漠視的問題、以現在救中國即所謂建設新中國的唯一的大政策、唯一大工工作、就是要努力興辦交通、交通包括的範圍甚廣、有河港問題、鐵路問題、航空問題、道路問題、今天是道路協會開十週年紀念第一次路市展覽大會之日、我們先談談道路問題、道路對於各種方面的功用、剛才已經談過、不再絮談了、關於道路、本有國道省道市道縣道等分别、國道由中央興築、省道市道由省市縣道由縣分别修築、如此辦法、才可以分工合作、逹到完成的目的、即以都市而論、假令都市交通、縱甚便利而四鄕到逹都市的交通、如果不便、則都市繁榮、當然發生影響所以說到興築道路問題、關於都市交通、固應積極整頓、而整頓内地交通、修築内地道路、也是刻不容緩的事實、前清時代、北京是首都、當時即以北京爲中心、修治各省的官路、有所謂（官馬北路、）（官馬西路、）（官馬南路、）的分别、此外由各省省城以逹各處、亦各設有官路支線、算是大路、而各地方村鎭之間、又築了許多小路、和這大路聨絡、成功了一種道路網、但自廢驛用郵以後、修治道路的事、漸次停頓了、一直到現在、我國的道路事業、還在幼稚時代、所幸國民革命軍完成北伐以後、中央遵照總理遺囑、努力訓政建設、施行地方自治、並規定在訓政時期之中、各自治單位四境縱横各道路、修築成功國民會議議及實業建設程序、有限於民國二十四年底止、全國必須增加並完成二十萬公里之公路的决議、可見政府及國民代表、都知道路政的重要、正在共同努力、促其實現、全國道路協會成立以來、致力於發展道路的宣傳、不遺餘力、所出的刊物、又非常之多、如市政全書、道路全書、道路月刋之類、都足爲我們極好的參考資料、對於中國路市兩政的計畫和貢獻、可說是十分精審、而且偉大、國内各處、建築道路時、在人才方面、計劃方面、得道路協會的助力、也非常之多、現在又籌辦了這個市政展覽會、主旨在促進路市兩面的發展、而恰好又在本市舉辦、本市獲益之處、自然更多了、兄弟除代表國府主席致詢以外、還得以市政當局的地信、向道路協會致諭、並祝諸君努力、</p>
<p>▲孔祥熙致詞（上略）大概人類的環境、因需要而改變、在中國北方各處的道路、都是很闊、有四十尺或六十尺不等在南方的道路很窄、因爲北方多旱路、南方多水道、故南方人大都注重水道、但現在環境變更現在的交通、與從前大不相同、有了汽車火車、從前要走數天的現在只要數小時了、中國古語有句話、王道蕩蕩、王道平平、意思就是道路一定要闊、一定要平、在國民黨領導之下、提倡地方自治、是最要緊的事情、還有國民黨所提倡的民生主義、民生主義、是總理三民主義中最重要的一點、建築道路、亦民生主義中一要素、最近有自江西回來的軍官說、江西地方没有好的道路所以勦匪亦很不易、蓋因没有好的道路、赤匪隨處躱藏、襲擊國軍、如果江西有很多好的道路、交通便利、勦匪工作亦便利多多矣、除道路之外、對於水道、亦不能不注意如運河自天津起、直到江南止、從前係用人工開掘、近因注重火車、致河道淤塞、於是今年江北、乃有這樣大的水災、故吾人除注意道路之外、對於水道亦應注重、最近東北遼寗民生廠、造了一部運貨汽車、可說是中國第一部自造的汽車、其中原料、雖全非國產、但據最近所得的消息該廠現想盡力改良製造、這也是值得吾人注意的一回事、諸位都都白汽車發明者亨利福特他在開始研究時、許多人都說他是痴子、天天在一家飯店旁一塊空地上、研究機器吃飯也是在這飯店内、到後來研究將近成功之時福特向飯店主人說要買汽車公司股票否、飯店主人揺頭不贊成、後來公司發逹、一元之股本、乃得一萬元之利益、於是飯店主人天天怨自己、深悔從前不買汽車公司股票、否則亦一大財主矣至於汽車成功之後不但是福特個人發財、而美國亦受其賜、故兄弟希望諸位能以福特之精神來發展道路、則成績大有可觀矣、交通發逹世界大同、亦易實現、（炳勛速記社關景波記、</p>
<p>▲褚民誼致詞（上略）道路與國家民生之關係、已由王會長孔會長張市長說得很詳細、毋庸贅述、不過中國交通之不便、是實在的事實、兄弟在三天前剛從新疆回來、在從前要到新疆去、最少要一百餘日且道路不平、旅行大感困苦、但是坐了爬山汽車、只有三十餘天、即可到逹、然兄弟尙有一種感想、就是要去自己國内的地方、須假道外國這是很悲痛而且很痛心的一回事譬如往新疆、要假道西伯利亞鐵道、往雲南須假道安南、所以我們要一决積極提倡築路、然後政治方面、經濟方面、及其他種種問題、才有發展之希望、此爲兄弟之一點感想、貢獻於諸位云云、</p>

<p>我殊不幸、從小就失學、在十四歲時、即入商界爲學徒經數年之奮鬥、　幸得較高之職位、但是現在所有之國文智識、在職務上極感不夠應用、從前曾聞人言、謂欲使國文之通遠、其惟一之方法、多讀多看、我數年來即根據此說、所讀書籍、亦不下百數十卷、但是所得之成績、實屬有限、於是對於單純的多讀多看、能增進國文智識之一說、不免稍生懷疑、今敬求先生指敎下列二點、（一）先生從前修國文、讀那幾部書、又文字通順、是得力於那幾部書、（二）必須如何、而後始可使國文有長足的進步、</p>
<p>（覆）國文分兩方面、（一）是思想、多讀書、多看報、多觀察世界事情、與夫一切人情物態、積蓄豐富、自然其文可觀、宗旨光明純正、所謂文以載道、就是、（二）是藝術、有了思想、還須有發表的能力、又可分爲兩層、（一）是應用文、是從需要方面着想、以能供給他的需要爲滿足、（二）是美文、如何爲美、不容易說、但可說一共通的標準、就是（感動讀者、感動的程度愈高、愈美、感動的範圍愈廣、愈美、感動的時間愈長、愈美、</p>

<h3>王粲儀君訊</h3>
<p>我是一個米舖小職員、靠着汗血的代價、能夠安然渡過、我個人的生計、已是僥倖極了、那想還能擔養父母、和着綢緞、餐佳肴、近幾天、父母東走西　、爲我議婚、他們呢、是對兒子的手續可說齊備、那知我從中受了惡劣環境的絀縛、并且父母已是風中殘燭、到那時候、一個未歷世故、意志薄弱的我、立刻發生經濟恐慌、恐怕就要流成乞丐、我現在把這意旨進告、又恐傷了父母的心、做兒女的良心上、是萬不應該、若是應順了、眼見這枷加在身上、正是進退維谷的當兒、我以十二分的誠懇、向記者先生請指示一個良法使我可以應付、請在報端答覆、敬祝貴報前程萬里、</p>
<p>（覆）你爲經濟的關系、不贊成父母早早替你議婚、免得將來經濟愈加恐慌、你的主張很不錯、况且照你來信所開的年齡、也不過十八歲、儘可以遲幾年、你該把這一點意思、很誠懇地、很和婉地、反復說給父母聽、不要得罪父母、但你的主見、倒要很牢牢地拿定的、</p>

<p>（覆）黟縣山多田少、農產旣不豐、而世俗又以（側重商業、鄙棄農工）致使肥沃而適宜種殖的山、多被他鄕人民越俎代謀、喧賓奪主、君旣關懷桑梓、應該聨合智識分子、向故鄕父老、大聲疾呼、提倡（農工神聖）、矯止相沿成風的階級觀念、這一點、似乎是根本補救的方法、</p>
<p>黟縣女子除耕織以外、似乎還可以做些家庭職業、像縫絍、養鷄等、因爲黟縣交通梗阻、往市鎭不便、要是學會了縫絍、織了布、就可以自己製衣、非但省却很貴的裁縫工資、還可以免得遠道跋踄之勞、可謂一舉兩得、徽州各縣對於雞蛋的用途很廣、年頭歲尾、婚姻喜事、和平時人客來往、都要以此敬客、供不應求、仰給　省、價值非常昻貴、黟縣若提倡養雞、把雞蛋運到休寗等處、一定還可以暢銷、至於飼雞的食料、並不一定需要穀粒、聽說有一種肥虫、飼雞是最好的、君不妨留意關於養雞書籍、把最好的方法、指導黟縣人民、君以爲怎樣、</p>

<h3>精衛與志摩之喜事觀</h3>
<p>民國十四年中秋後二日，徐志摩約我們到海寗去看潮，同去的有陳衛哲，胡適之，朱經農，汪精衛，任叔永，一位美國女敎授，其餘的人記不清了。有人問經農說：（什麽事這樣得意？）精衛說：（結婚吧？您得請我們吃喜酒。）我說：（比給婚還好。）精衛説：（那麽是生兒子了。）志摩說：（生兒子不如結婚；結婚不如訂婚；訂婚不如求婚；求婚不如求不成。）在這寥寥數語中，我們可以找着兩種的人生觀。精衛所猜是一般中國人之心理；志摩所說是詩人之態度。一般中國人之心理是要求多福多壽多男子。結婚可喜；生兒子更可喜，詩人的見解却不然。失了戀纔寫得出好詩來。歌德失掉夏緑蒂而少年維特的煩惱一書遂佔據了普天下青年們的心靈。志摩知道這個道理却不能終身奉行。小曼答了一聲（Yes）之後，詩神便向志摩不告而别了。他當然還會做詩、祇是没有從前寫的那麽好，這在愛讀志摩詩的人們看來是何等重大的損失呀！</p>
<h3>記東京兩怪人</h3>
<p>— 老癯</p>
<p>日本東京。每於日夕西下之時。常見有形若乞丐之二人。徘徊電車站邊。一年約四十餘。一則將四十歲。衣服之襤褸。較之乞丐。或猶過之。在地上檢收棄物若烟頭殘布。皆爲其囊中之物。其每日飲食。常仰給於富家唾餘。故每至餐時。相率止於富家相近之牆隅。見有棄傾之食品。即趨前索取。嚼之甚甘。津津若有餘味。此二人一名佐竹音喜。一名碑文谷一。初視之。必以爲卑田院中人。實不知此二人者。居於東京之碑衾町。雖非巨富。然已有鉅萬之資。其所以如此者。乃以生性鄙吝。不欲費其一文錢購食物及衣履也。故無不以怪人目之。</p>
<p>佐竹在二十餘歲時。與碑文同爲電車轉運手。往來於横濱神戶之間。日人之所謂轉運手者、即開車是。二人吝嗇成性。志同道合。非惟衣履破污。除公司所給制服外。即襯衫之微。亦復無有。所得工資。皆存積之。後公司中。覺佐碑二人品類太下。下令撤職。由是二人即度其乞丐生活。並不再謀生計。每日將其乞得之資。投諾銀行。以爲儲蓄。衣履食物。無一非乞而得者。故可終日不費一錢。迄今已二十年矣。</p>
<p>查二人所有之財產。佐竹在東京有市房三間。銀行儲蓄一萬三千元。其最奇者。乃有電話機主權二十四架。出租於人。收取租金。蓋東京電話。常求多於供。於是得電話機者。以爲非常艱難。常有以二三千元日金。挖頂一機。故亦爲其產業之一。亦不知其如何能得此二十四架電話機之主權也。每機每月收租息洋六元。此二十四機。每月已有一百四十四元之進欵。總計每月進益。在四百元奇。佐竹收得之後。立存入銀行。即（一錢之微。未嘗動用也。碑文較之佐竹。似稍遜色。其有東京市房二所。銀行存欵一萬一千餘元。電話機十七架。每月進項。亦在三百元以上。而碑文依然度其乞丐生活。與佐竹同其志趨。以是東京市上。僉稱之爲兩怪物云。</p>
<h3>乞同人抽頭充衣賑啓</h3>
<p>— 志中</p>
<p>自水災嚴重。滬上耳目所接。無非乞振之聲。亦可見解衣推食。人有同情也。昨在友人處。見有乞抽賭稅充衣振啟事一則。吐屬雋雅。亦災振中别開生面者也。亟爲披露如左。</p>
<p>呼雉呼盧。人生須行樂耳。無衣無褐。小民如卒歲何。蓋博驍矢以三千。原屬尋歡之具。而取囊頭於什一。寗非助振之資。竊見巨浸稽天。餓。莩載道。縱倖逃夫滅頂。奈難禦於祁寒。觀鄭俠流民之圖。忍使一夫不獲。踵鮑叔分金之局。何妨五木爲緣。同人長日消閒。撩零作戲。　非孤注。豈伊豬牧奴所爲。稅取長　。要惟囊　家是賴。必有主其事者。盍不因而利之。分餘潤於錙銖。集腋即成裘之助。推同情於袍澤。解衣誠挾　之恩。哀此孑遺。呼來將伯。苟拔十以得五。行累萬以盈千。固然但止乞頭。幸莫厭發棠之請。莫笑爲他作嫁。定不辜結草之酬。此啟。</p>
<h3>一言五命之慘刦</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<h3>高樓之夜</h3>
<p>— 愷</p>
<p>邇來萑苻不靖。焚掠時聞。鄕民小康之家。即有夜不安枕之象。昨有鄕友來錫。爲述一最慘之刦案。數日前事也去吾家十餘里。爲丹陽與武進交界之區。有村曰毛家塘。居民陳翁。故江北籍。遷此有年。以力耕致富。今老矣。兒孫繞膝。晚境方自慰也。村中某甲。以春初造屋。向翁借瓦一萬。久假不歸。翁屢向之索還。及近日相值於近村一茶店中。乃舊事重提。甲告翁曰。明日先還五千。尙有五千。請待來年。可乎。翁頷首許之。不意旁座竊聽者。誤以爲五千銀數也。翌日之夜。遂有羣盜入門。見翁。即向之索銀五千。實則翁家一無現欵。所存惟穀類。以市價不美而未售去耳。盜無所得。則舉火以洩憤。焚死室中者兩男兩女。皆翁孫也。更有一長孫出外鳴鑼者。則死於槍彈。旣倒地。而鑼聲猶作。乃加以數槍焉。天明。翁覩此家破人亡之慘狀。亦一慟而絕。嗚呼。一言之誤。禍及全家。其所以爲導火綫者。似有鬼神之弄巧焉。然陳翁爲人良懦。凡地方公益善舉。常首先出資。信乎與世無爭。與人無怨。初非土豪比也。而所遭如是其慘。豈其數有前定者耶。人生到此。天道寗論。吾於翁事亦云。</p>
<h3>宋碗</h3>
<p>— 黎叔平</p>
<p>友人自湘來。爲述湘中發現宋代古碗事。頗奇特。濡筆誌之。以告國人。</p>
<p>湘省連年興築公路。進行甚力。因塡築道路。穿鑿山壁於湘潭縣南路某鄕。有路工某甲。開掘山洞。發現磁碗六具。直徑約七寸許。高可三寸。碗外泥土黏附。及携歸滌凈。則五光十色。閃灼耀目。路工置家中。亦不之異。久之。有人語於路局之工程師某某。料非凡品。因知某西人精於賞鑒。乃借往一觀。西人一一捧視。雖無年代可考。但色雅質輕。叩之聲清而遠。故斷爲宋代遺物。係合珠玉製。始能光彩奪目。歷久不變。因詢索值幾何。路工舉雙手齊摇意謂此不足言價。而西人誤認索價十千。即出萬元支票。路工本鄕人。習用現銀。曾不知支票爲何物。任置桌上不顧。以碗授西人持去。工程師行時。告以此票值萬元。宜愼重保存。路工終不信。笑曰。若此紙果值萬元。請與君均分之。工程師喜諾。納票袋中。曰吾爲汝赴漢向某銀行兌取。言已偕西人去。未一月。果送來銀元五千。路工出不意。頓成富翁。自樂不可言。而工程師已辭去職務。携欵赴某國留學。西人獲此六碗。則不知所終云。</p>
<p>叔平曰。自庚子之亂。吾國寳物流出外洋。不知凡幾。倫敦皇家博物館中。强半皆吾國舊藏。吾人苟目擊之。未有不心傷者。若此六碗。亦可謂希世之寳。應藏諸國内博物館或陳列所。以垂永久。豈可任外人賤值易去。彼工人固無知。若某工程師者。要不能辭其咎也。（移酬助賑）</p>

<h3>睇嚮齋逞談</h3>
<p>— 甘簃</p>
<p>張弧周學熙</p>
<p>共和已廿稔。政府總筦度支者。歲必易人。或數易人。賢哲同未嘗無一二。而驟躋高位其才不足以應事者爲多。舍借債搜括外無他道。余獨取張岱杉（弧）周緝之（學熙）之處事有方。應付中節。弧與學熙皆登甲乙科。一膺監司。一官太守。並有聲於清季。弧尤富文藻。饒才思。當甲寅乙卯間。項城執政。權傾全國。殊有粉飾太平之觀。其時學熙長財部弧貳部務兼筦鹽署。學熙持開源節流之策。行之而著效。坐是國庫不竭。政費有裕。未聞將領强索軍需者。權勢如馮國璋張勳之徒。亦鮮苛求。屈映光且羅掘巨萬。接濟中央。固項城之威逼。抑亦學熙及弧之力成之也。久之。二人議事輒齟齬。蓋學熙吝嗇。往往不近人情。弧豪侈。有大刀闊斧之目。宜不能相容。學熙恃項城寵信。舉某案揭弧之短。固未知其事實項城與謀。學熙面參之頃。項城欲有言。格格不能出諸口。不獲已下令免弧職。遠遺巴蜀。陰使人以辭慰弧。謂劉晏理財無過。管仲終當復用。其罪在我。暫避爲佳。弧以是濡滯不克行。已而弧復職受事而令周子沂（自齊）代學熙之任。學熙先已得報。亟入謁。自齊先在座。項城俟熙辭畢。愠曰。予固知子之爲人。奈何不審予志趣所在。辦大事者。豈能借小費。且言且以目視自齊。曰。緝之久勞。理當息肩。爾可代之。蕭規曹隨。予放心矣。自齊力陳匪才力克勝。項城曰。毋多言。多言亦不爾恕。自齊乃不復語。學熙怏怏而退。立提辭表。歷數年。弧亦以財長隱居。甲子起爲大司徒。學熙疑弧或未忘前事。將謀報復。内不自安。其父玉山（馥）以箋逹弧。責具子已往之失。弧覽書笑曰。諺所謂一人難滿千人意。又曰人生何處不相逢。爲書畬馥曰。終某之任。當不復見茲事之暴露。馥每舉以告人。曰。岱杉畢竟書生。雅度靡可遠也。</p>
<p>説部扶輪會</p>
<h3>丈夫的妻子（十二）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>同時陳先生和夫人吵嘴，已告失敗，他是不開口了，只蒙了被睡在床上，任憑他夫人如何吵鬧，只作爲不聞，這樣的態度，當然也是女性的態度。陳夫人見他不作聲了，自然一個人吵了一會，也只得停止了。</p>
<p>從這一天起，這兩對夫婦，各自的起了絕大的怨望，狠厚的隔膜；但是蘭珍狠憐惜着陳先生的受夫人的壓迫，李先生却贊成陳夫人的爽脆。陳夫人竟會跑到李先生的辦事地方去訪談的，或者同去看電影，上跳舞塲，或者到朋友家裏去打牌。李先生還是照常辦完了公事便回家，蘭珍却時常走到陳先生屋子裏去談天。蘭珍所談起的，起初只限於李先生的荒唐與薄倖；並且把雪中等候丈夫，瞧見汽車裏一個女人的事，也告訴了陳先生。陳先生自告奮勇，允許設法去偵探這個女人是普通的娼妓，抑是李先生的外室，或者是非正式的戀人，有了眉目，一定詳細告訴蘭珍。</p>
<p>陳先生與蘭珍，其實都是一個被壓迫者，所以大家發牢騷，越是愛發牢騷的人，越容易投機而契合，他們每天有長時間的談話機會，友誼也逐漸地深長，同時李先生與陳夫人，每天在黑暗中看電影跳舞場上的摟抱，自然格外容易親近。陳先生家裏的許多事，陳夫人因爲不常在家，什麽也不管理，便央着李夫人帮助料理，甚而至於鋪床疊被補襪，端整夜飯菜，也全由李先生管理了。在事實上，李夫人等於陳先生的妻子，李先生是陳夫人的丈夫了，以舊道德的立塲講，簡直是怎樣的一件荒唐史啊！</p>
<p>但是陳先生因此負担是加重了。他憐着李夫人，這樣的拮据，不免時常送些衣服給伊，或者送些旁的東西，一個月至少也得二三十元左右。</p>
<p>李先生的負担也加重了。每天在外面和陳夫人一同遊玩，當然是他的責任，决没有敎女人担任這耗費的道理。他越是浪費，家裏越加嗇刻，甚而至於每天的伙食費都枝節節的不付了。</p>

<p>昨日本埠證劵市塲各債劵市况、期市依然活潑、賣買人氣暢旺、蓋債價復跌、各方進出甚踴躍也、而現市極沉靜、至言市價變動情形、在晨初開出時、即爲市上售出新債劵踴躍、一時賣氣大旺、各價下跌頗巨、惟自後求供形勢漸平、債價大見平和、每盤多無大漲落、債價之變動、至是或略告一段落矣、結果除關稅·裁兵始終堅定、較前多續漲、編遣·整六·一九關等僅小數角外、鹽稅十月跌二元一角半、其九月期及统稅亦小一元六七角、二○關跌一元錄、餘均回降頗巨也、計期貨交易上午一千五百七十萬、後市八百八十萬、合計二千四百五十萬、又現貨共祇四十元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市形態俏麗</h3>
<p>紗市堅定、但形勢略見俏利、蓋因有一部份抵空、致市氣帶漲、但海外花紗狀况仍不脫疲境、所以有一部份仍抛買做空、且以各方水災劇烈、將後有碍實銷、然各廠商均無意大量套買、故市面立定、盤勢較烈、</p>
<p>▲人標漲五六錢人標前市開盤、以美棉平平、形勢較軟、各跌五·六錢、午後聞三品紗漲、人氣見硬、且有大戶抵空、各月漲四·六·八錢至一兩、成交統計一萬七千八百包、查買出益昶一千包、公泰五百五十包、義餘五百包、天隆五百五十包瑞大一千四百包、永昌四百五十包、買進大孚一千包、信誠二千二百包、新昌四百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市平正</h3>
<p>棉市略平、但大勢狀况仍乏精神、以外棉市况頗弱、且日商時有抛賣、故市盤軟中帶昻、現需各廠均無問訊、以外棉廉宜、且各洋行特别遷就、惟漢帮仍無賣意、逢跌購進做多、前途仍以美棉爲進退也、</p>
<p>▲漢標稍穩漢標前市開盤平平、後以二三盤稍堅、各月微跌五分至一錢、午後各月略漲一·二錢、成交統計四萬○四百擔、查買出益成二千四百擔、餘昶二千三百擔、新豐一千二百擔、賡豐一千七百擔、厚豐昌一千擔、恒益一千擔、買進長豐三千三百擔、益昶二千七百擔、信誠一千九百擔、愼昌一千擔、吉豐一千四百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>上週美棉套售略增</h3>
<p>紐約十一日來電報告一週中之棉市云星期二之政府棉產估計發表、較大衆之預期略高、但其影響不巨、全週套售之增加甚微、胡佛總統與聨邦銀行以及棉商等所討論設立一私家銀行、信用貸欵、以致美棉之輪出一事、頗使投機者之賣出减少、而感起一時之買進、但價格反動、供給即易增進、多數專家深信下季减種運動、及其他救濟原棉事件、都爲目前南方之囤持運動也、棉收雖依然延緩、但氣候則仍形良好、市面頗靜、氣象概存觀望、苟收獲進步、則套賣可望增加云、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市愈趨愈軟</h3>
<p>▲南市西路各帮來源尙湧、早晚稻到二十二三號、浦江中存積船貨約三十號左右、本街胃口、因晨間天色不佳、市上臨市人數寥寥、做開交易微細、客帮辦去三百擔、行情續短、蘇同平黎後路來貨亦不缺、兼之宿積尙厚、形勢短去二尺、洋蘆尖鬆落角許、變陰元酒坊飯担需要尙殷價昻角許、新粳貨色有限、價形穩固之象、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日不見活動、河下斛脚難以起色、晨間各店號交易稀少、厚粳高貨低落一角、薄早二稻上落有限、新粳新尖來貨尙多、價疲三角、洋蘆尖因本城方面、買進極缺、外埠如甬越二帮均有續辦消息、裏路來船、計常熟·無錫·宜興·金澤·石浦·松江等十八號、</p>
<h3>洋米國内外均呈疲弱</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、仍無大帮去化、行情續形疲落、本街囤戶趁其疲小之機會、略爲收買、因此市面似呈疲中帶定之局、統市祗由本街應酬一號次西貢五百包、價十四元一角、台州米續有到埠、客化依然平淡、惟台州出數有限、前定總額裝齊後、或無再來、故行情尙能穩定、計開出三百五十包、價十三元一二角、由本街實戶辦去、洋米國外市價、已見報小、昨日各洋行均有兜售、價比週初小去二錢左右、泰和電報即裝五百噸、價討六兩八錢半、禪臣打出電報十月份五百噸、價六兩七錢半、均係一號西貢云、</p>
<h3>粉市午後軟落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後、各廠均有抛售、惟國外洋麥報漲三四角、一部分業外多頭仍有收買、故上午各盤、市價尙居盤旋之局、下午開市後因麥市已　廠家繼續抛售、大多頭亦在近期回出、市面隨見變化、本月份因現化已無續去、散廠套買尤力、收市價反比前日小去一分、十月十一月各小二厘半、十二月未有出入、一月二月各小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥急轉直下</h3>
<p>昨日麥市開市後、各月份交易清淡、進戶寥寥、多頭均欲出擋、市上買氣充塞、數日來俏漲之市面、翻成急轉直下之疲局、大多頭與内地囤戶儘量回出、浮空趁機競賣、以致開市後逐盤下跌、雖洋麥電訊報漲三四角、而市面一無影響、收市各月份小三分、十月分小三分、十一月份小三分、十二月份小四分、一二月份各小三分、現麥略有到頭、惟廠胃反淡、統市祇由華豐廠辦去鎭江麥二百包、價三兩五錢半、無錫麥五百包、價三兩六錢、揚州麥四百包、價三兩六錢至三兩五錢半云、</p>
<h3>南北貨金針菜市價步升</h3>
<p>存底單薄</p>
<p>金針菜近以粤銷暢盛、市價逐步趨升、號盤中莊貨開二十二兩半、次至二十兩零半、查市上存底極爲單薄、統共不上二千包、市象堅俏、無復鬆望、昨市行盤頂莊菜售二十八兩至二十七兩半、以次自二十六兩至二十一兩不一、</p>
<h3>新圓肉開價高昻</h3>
<p>比陳貨差二十餘兩</p>
<p>新生晒圓肉、前日到有一批、統共僅五件、以初次見新、頗覺希罕、故開價甚俏、當即售通、此批身份甚潮、兼有黑瓣、開至六十六兩、較高者有一二兩上落、聞地價劃申須七十兩云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊市仍無起色</h3>
<p>美法等處廠經、昨晨雖有電轉交易、奈米價不高、絲本仍昻、成交難暢、昨祇乾利等進滬白廠經五十包、三星等進黄粗絲二十包、價仍平定云</p>
<h3>杭垣新秋蘭開價激漲</h3>
<p>繭行競收優繭···價開七十餘元</p>
<p>杭屬今歲秋蠶、仍受天時不正影響、蠶蟻在大眠時、發生變化、傾棄十之四五、早蠶繭已上市、拱宸橋繭行均已開秤、市上到貨不暢、晚蠶尙祇上簇、繭商競收優繭、不惜放價鮮繭、初開五十五至六十元現已漲至七十至七十五元、各行收繭仍屬有限云、</p>
<h3>貢熙緑茶俄銷暢逹</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之貢熙緑茶、俄國協助會、進意頗濃、英莊福時保昌等行、亦略有需要、市况尙不寂寞、售盤開出五十五六兩、亦頗爲堅挺、惟珍眉大帮等項、洋行家多因日前發出電報、未有回音、態度轉趨觀望、市面略形清淡云、</p>
<h3>路莊茶共到十六萬餘箱</h3>
<p>路莊緑茶爲對外貿易之重要貨品、本年各路收成歉折、店莊銷胃浩大、運銷洋莊之額數、因之益形稀少、現下各路來源、已告斷絕、特將到數總額調查錄下、洪源永三萬八千一百四十六箱、永盛昌一萬九千八百二十六箱、昇昌盛一萬八千五百十箱、公升永一萬八千七百四十八箱、源豐潤一萬、千六百十九箱、愼源一萬六千一百四十三箱永興隆一萬二千百十二箱、忠信昌一萬一千五百二十箱、仁德永七千五百六十八箱、乾記一千四百九十九箱、共到十六萬三千二百九十一箱、較上年减少九萬箱、較前年减少十六萬箱、華茶對外貿易之衰退、已可概見也、</p>
<h3>五金美馬口鐵提價二錢半</h3>
<p>昨日五金市面仍鮮進展氣象、蓋客銷停頓、實爲最大原因、故全市特殊情形可錄、惟美馬口鐵市面則由軟弱而趨挺秀、其價初爲十五兩二錢半、昨則加至十五兩五錢至七錢半不等、交易出口帮若天津·海參威·福建諸帮絡繹收辦、故開出有五六百箱之多、但本埠萎靡不振之市面、今被搜辦之後、居然趨俏、聞將來廠家生意一動、則前途市面更爲可觀也、</p>
<h3>雜訊美棉一萬包明日進口、</h3>

<h3>Li, Zhang, Wu Telegraph to Guangdong Urging Peace</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee members Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, and Wu Tiecheng telegraphed to Guangdong on the 10th, urging peace, and also sent the original telegram to Chairman Chiang. The excerpt is as follows: (Immediate delivery requested, respectfully to Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, confidential) We recently sent a telegram to Guangdong through Mr. Shi Zeng Puquan, which reads: "Our country is facing unprecedented severe natural disasters and internal and external troubles. This is due to the failure to achieve peace and construction due to years of war, but also because our comrades in the party cannot unite and work hard. We are already too late to blame ourselves, let alone remedy the situation. However, the two Guangdongs are hastily planning to jointly send troops to Hunan and Jiangxi, and the bad news has shocked the whole country. It must be known that sending troops at this time, no matter what the reason, is tantamount to taking advantage of the crisis of the nation and making things difficult for our compatriots. The whole country is carrying out an anti-Japanese movement, while Guangdong is engaging Chen and Liu to visit the Eastern Neighbor. The whole country is seeking peace and disaster relief, while the two Guangdongs are jointly sending troops to Hunan and Jiangxi. Why are you so lacking in awareness of the times and circumstances? Even if the late Premier Sun Yat-sen were alive, he would not allow this. Even if you comrades do not consider the nation, can you not leave some room for reconciliation with the people of the country? We hope that you comrades will abandon prejudices and preconceived notions of right and wrong for the sake of the party and the nation, summon the courage to rein in at the edge of the cliff, and turn hostility into friendship. A change of mind is all that is needed. We pour out our hearts, speak with tears, and make a final appeal for the suffering compatriots. We are at your service." (Respectfully presented by Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, and Wu Tiecheng. Stamped with "Wu Tiecheng") (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

(Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

Consul-General Hayashi also verbally requested a formal response, stating that the facts of the killing were so obvious and hoped that the Northeast authorities would take sincere action. Zang replied that the second investigation team would return to Shenyang in a week and that a reply could be given at that time, and expressed the possibility of a satisfactory resolution.

<h3>Luxury Goods Tax Increase for Disaster Relief Issues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the proposal to increase taxes on luxury goods to relieve the national flood disaster, the competent department of the Ministry of Finance believes that if it is of a temporary nature, a few percent of the current tax rate can be added as a disaster relief donation. If the current import and export tax rates and local business tax rates are to be modified to increase the tax rate on luxury goods as a permanent measure, it would be very difficult in practice.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Telegram Commending Suppression of the Red Army</h3>

<p>(Nanchang) It is confirmed that the false 3457812, etc. bandit armies in Gao Xing Wei were killed by Chen Mingshu, seven or eight thousand, and thousands of guns were seized.

<h3>Southern Hunan Defenses Consolidated</h3>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Troops Advance Very Slowly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Those coming by plane from Changsha said that the Guangdong side's troop dispatch had a psychological effect and the troops advanced very slowly. The Central Government has deployed defenses in the Hengyang highlands and prepared positions. When they come, they can be defeated in one fell swoop. Because of the flood in Hunan Province, Yangtze River ships under 1,000 tons can directly open to Zhuzhou Lukou in the Xiangjiang River, and rear transportation is very convenient. It is expected that the Guangdong-Guangxi army will not dare to advance. Gu Zhutong said that the Guangdong side lacked weapons and ammunition and was unable to attack. Our army was ordered to defend, and the use of troops did not need to be too large. The advantages of host and guest labor and leisure were very clear. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

The division commanders are scheduled to return to defense today and tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Dongtai Strives to Open Dikes</h3>
<p>The Dongtai County Party Department and various legal groups issued a public statement, stating that the Dafeng Yuhua companies had repeatedly telegraphed that they had assessed the Sanmao and You ports, but in fact, they had no sincerity. They secretly added an earth dam and a hidden dam every seven and a half miles inside the Zi, Wu, Mao, and You rivers after opening the dikes and then blocking them. Moreover, the company's dikes were several feet higher than the water surface outside the dikes, so the water flow was not smooth and the drainage was minimal. Now, the water level in Dongxing and other counties is getting higher and higher, the people are more and more panicked, the food is less and less, and the deaths are more and more numerous. The company relies on financial groups and powerful people as backing, trying to maintain its own interests and sacrificing the lives and property of millions of people. They fabricate lies and false reports, and He Haiqiao and Xu Ji, members of the provincial committee who were ordered to supervise the opening of the company's dikes, were deceived by the company's rhetoric, violated the provincial order, and violated the meeting minutes. They claimed that their mission to Dongtai was only to open 800 zhang, and they did not mention a word about opening the company's dikes. They deceived the provincial government with telegrams above and oppressed the people with troops below, showing loyalty to the company. Now, the water in the counties in the lower reaches of the river is torrential, and the Yun dike has breached, which cannot be quickly blocked to drain the water, and the outlet cannot be quickly opened. They are truly confined to death. In addition to telegramming the provincial party department and the provincial government, we earnestly request that you uphold justice and provide assistance, urging the provincial government to strictly order the swift opening of all the company's dikes, sluice gates, and dams that obstruct the water. At the same time, we should allocate several million yuan in public bonds to quickly block the Yun dike's breaches and open and deepen the five ports along the coast and build gates. We should also severely punish water conservancy officials for dereliction of duty and the two provincial committee members He and Xu. We also earnestly request that you forward this appeal to domestic and foreign charitable organizations to raise emergency relief funds to save the lives of millions of people. In this urgent telegram, the Dongtai County Party Department and various legal groups respectfully request your attention.</p>
<h3>Our Representative's Speech at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>How to Stop Military Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Chinese delegation in Geneva stating that the Chinese representative at the League of Nations Assembly said that China opposes any actions that stir up national animosity and cause difficulties in negotiations between the two countries. China fully supports the current General Assembly's efforts to reconcile the Treaty of Paris and the League of Nations Covenant. However, it should be noted that ways should be found to stop Country A from using military force to invade Country B. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 12th League of Nations Assembly opened in Geneva. Our representatives Shi Zhaoji, Wu Kaisheng, and Wang Jiazhen were all in attendance. Our country has recently recovered national sovereignty, such as tariff autonomy, the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and the recovery of concessions and leased territories in China from various countries. Although we have gained the sympathy of most friendly countries, some countries still have many difficulties due to conflicting interests. Recently, the situation between China and Japan has deteriorated. Since the Wan incident and the Korean massacre occurred one after another, Japan, knowing that it is in the wrong, is using the so-called Nakamura incident as an excuse to make final emergency arrangements for Manchuria and Mongolia. These facts are sufficient to be a guide for destroying peace in the Far East. The relevant parties in our country and the three representatives Shi, Wu, and Wang discussed by telegram to advocate maintaining and protecting peace in the Far East at the General Assembly and to announce the truth of the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations to the international community in order to win the sympathy of countries around the world.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>(Peace) (Struggle) (Save China)</h3>
<p>(Peace, Struggle, Save China) These seven characters are the testament of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the people of the country when he was dying. Mr. Sun believed that if one wanted to save China, one must rely on (peace and struggle). At a time when internal and external troubles are forcing themselves upon us and the country's steps are extremely difficult, it makes the people of the country feel the importance of Mr. Sun's testament all the more. The seven-character instruction uttered during the difficult groans on his deathbed, we believe, is what those who most revere Mr. Sun today should truly recognize and earnestly follow.</p>
<p>The current serious situation of natural disasters, internal turmoil, and external troubles arriving at the same time is precisely to test whether those who usually take saving the country and the people as their own responsibility can shoulder this heavy responsibility and to test whether the Chinese nation has self-determination. The attitude we should take under this great test is not fear, not passivity, but an active attitude and a spirit of innovation.</p>
<p>Break through the current difficulties and save China. Save the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Saving China. Saving the Chinese nation is nothing else. The first is (peace.) The second is (struggle.) To work together in a spirit of harmony and mutual assistance in hard struggle. Mr. Sun's last words are truly the only way for us to save the country and the nation at present.</p>
<p>Why is peace necessary? Mr. Sun once said, "China is still in a dangerous era. If everyone seeks their own interests and does not take the country as a prerequisite, even if foreigners are watching covetously and the disaster of partition is imminent, even if people do not plot against us, it is difficult to succeed with disunity." Since the revolution, disturbances have occurred one after another, and there has not been a single peaceful day. The evil consequences of disunity in recent years are enough for us to think deeply and carefully. What's more, at present, floods are rampant, wailing sounds are everywhere, and strong neighbors are pressing closely, waiting for an opportunity to move. The nation's and people's lives are constantly hanging by a thread. If we do not have peace, unity, and a single mind to jointly plan the country's affairs, how can we survive?</p>
<p>Why is struggle necessary? Peace is passive unity, and struggle is active action. The Chinese people are daily in a miserable situation of being tormented by natural disasters and man-made calamities. The Chinese nation is daily in the secondary colonial position under the joint domination of international imperialists. How can we save the people from fire and water? How can we save the country and the nation from danger? With passive peace and unity, there must be active efforts and struggle. Struggle is the only weapon to break through difficulties and an important condition for national survival. If we can base ourselves on peace and unity and use common struggle as a weapon, even if the current environment is extremely dangerous, we believe that the iron hand of struggle can definitely break through all difficulties.</p>
<p>Washington once said, "When parts are united, there is no fear of having no method and ability to enhance strength, increase strategies, and increase security to resist external dangers." Dewey also said, "Generally speaking, the civilization, strength, and weakness of mankind can be measured by their sociability. If one is sociable and gathers hundreds of millions of people as one, then the degree of civilization must be high and the country must be strong. There is no need to be naturally eliminated. If one is fragmented and contentious, the degree of civilization must be low and the country must be weak." These two sentences are really the best remedy for the current period of external troubles.</p>
<p>Therefore, (peace) and (struggle) are the only great ways to save China. And (clarifying politics) and (establishing moral standards) are the only ways to achieve peace, unity, and the common struggle of all people. Especially at present, we should truly recognize the meaning of the seven characters (peace, struggle, save China) and put them into practice.</p>

Amid shouts from the opposition, the Prime Minister defended the method of reducing unemployment benefits by 10%, saying that the Labor Cabinet had raised the issue of taxing tea and sugar before the formation of the new government. Tea and sugar are necessities for people's lives, and taxing them would harm the poor. However, without reducing unemployment benefits, both tea and sugar taxes could not be avoided. Reducing unemployment benefits would only affect those who are not completely unemployed, unlike the universal impact of tea and sugar taxes on all workers. The Prime Minister then exchanged fierce debates with former Minister of Works Lansbury. Former Home Secretary Clynes attacked the government's austerity plan, saying that this method would limit the people's purchasing power, only increase unemployment, and increase hardship. Clynes made many sarcastic remarks about Minister of Colonial Affairs Thomas. Thomas rose to end the debate, saying that the austerity plan currently under consideration by the House of Commons is no different from the £56 million in savings that Henderson, as the Labor Cabinet, had already approved during the debate on Tuesday. The austerity plan was temporarily suspended amidst an atmosphere of intense dispute, and the meeting adjourned until Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 11th Of the government's austerity plans, the most severe is the 15% reduction in teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries are meager, and after years of struggle, they hoped to obtain better treatment. Tonight, three thousand elementary school teachers marched in formation through the streets of London, neatly dressed and walking shoulder to shoulder. This is probably a rare demonstration in London. They went to Kingsway Hall to protest the salary cuts. One speaker said that as a result of the salary cuts, 53,000 teachers would earn less than three pounds per week, and 14,000 would earn less than two pounds. The speakers all stated the hardship of the lives of those who hold the teaching whip and dispersed after speaking. The meeting place was very crowded, with a total of 5,000 people, and another 1,000 people waited outside the door and could not enter.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 12th Tonight, Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden issued a broadcast speech, with clear sentences, as if talking to family members, stating the precarious position of British finances, the reasons for the budget presented yesterday, and the disasters that the nation could not avoid without immediate austerity measures. He said that the people of the country did not know that the cliff was already in front of them. If they continued to procrastinate, then wages, bonuses, and all income would be reduced in value, and it was unknown where it would end. This budget is an unavoidable measure, but he believes that this case is the greatest contribution he has made to the future welfare of colleagues. He also said that this financial trend has nothing to do with the pressure of banks. If all kinds of facts are announced one by one, then colleagues will definitely appreciate the efforts of the Bank of England to cope with the difficulties.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 11th Wall Street expressed satisfaction with the British budget, believing that the proposed sections are in line with expectations, and the article on cutting unemployment benefits is especially praised by the public. However, it is hoped that the increase in income tax will not be too burdensome for industry.</p>
<h3>Briand's Speech at the League of Nations Was Vague</h3>
<p>Germans Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>Curtius Sponsors the Litvinov Proposal</p>
<p>Mexico Joins the League of Nations with Conditions</p>
<p>▲Nations, Geneva, 11th French Foreign Minister Briand said in a speech at the League of Nations Assembly today that the disarmament conference is the first important step towards international cooperation. The meeting has been set to be held in February next year, and France will oppose any proposal to postpone it.

<p>Attempts to Shirk Responsibility for the Korean Incident</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 12th Members from various factions of the Showa Club of the House of Peers gathered at 10 a.m. today, and Mori Kakkei, the Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, reported on the survey of Manchuria and Korea. His conclusion stated that the Korean incident occurred because none of the heads of the Korean Governor-General's Office were in Korea at the time. China's arrogance in Manchuria and Mongolia is extremely concerning. Japan's vested interests are being gradually eroded by weak diplomacy, and silence is no longer possible. The completion of the Jilin-Huining Railway is an urgent matter at present.</p>

If the communist bandits are not completely wiped out today, there is a chance for resurgence. The flood is raging again, and the great flood is forming a monstrous force. Tens of millions of compatriots will either die by drowning or die of starvation, either be destroyed by the communist bandits or be trampled on by strong neighbors. If we do not eliminate the disputes of the spirits and seek a plan to save the country at this time, then the disaster of national subjugation can be reached in a short time. We ask our Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander to persevere and not be swayed by rumors and show a slight retreat, so as to hit their plan. The whole country's people will surely rise up when they hear the news and swear to be a backup.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Invade Hunan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Rumors of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies intending to invade Hunan have been circulating for a long time. As of the first of this month, the armies of the two provinces finally issued a general mobilization order. The Fourth Army Group of Guangxi Province was designated as the vanguard. The 30th Regiment of Wu Qiwei, and the 34th Regiment of Shen Youcheng, both under the 12th Division of the Fourth Army, commanded by Han Hanying, deputy division commander, advanced into Qiyang at 5 PM on the first. After the Ou and Shen regiments arrived at Qiyang, Wu Qiwei personally led the 36th Regiment of Wang Weicheng, the Special Service Battalion of Wen Xiang, the Machine Gun Battalion of Liu Dingwu, and the newly formed battalion of Yin Chengwu, continuing to advance on the third. The 7th Army of Liao Lei advanced from Yongzhou and stationed in Xinning, establishing contact with the First Army Group entering Hunan from Guangdong. The 24th Division of Qin Lianfang continued to set off for Qiyang on the third, to join up with Wu Qiwei's forces. This time, Li Zongren's Fourth Army Group of Guangxi Province is entirely under the command of Bai Chongxi. As for Guangdong Province, Chen Jitang's First Army Group, since its mobilization on the first, its vanguard troops are the newly formed 5th Independent Brigade under Chen Tiejian, which entered Hunan from Pingshi on the first, and advanced to Chenxian on the second. At the same time, the 3rd Army of Li Yangjing, stationed around Lechang, also advanced towards the Hunan border. The 7th Division of Huang Yanzhen had already passed Jiufeng, and the 8th Division of Huang Zhiwen also advanced from Shao towards Lechang on the second, encamping in Lechang on the evening of the third, and advancing towards the Hunan border the next morning. The 2nd Training Regiment of the 3rd Army, under Deng Hui, traveled by military train from Maba to Shao on the second, and then to Lechang Pingshi. After the 3rd Army departed, the 1st Army of Yu Hanmou followed closely behind. The 1st Army was stationed in the northwest suburbs and around Huaxian. On the evening of the second, the headquarters prepared three special trains, departing from Huangsha to Jiangcun Dalong Letong Xinjie stations, to transport the 2nd Division of the 1st Army, under Ye Zhao, north. The 4th Regiment of Ye Gengchang and the 5th Regiment of Li Chongguang of this division arrived in Shao in batches by special train on the fourth and concentrated there. The 6th Regiment of Huang Zhinan and the Directly Subordinate Training Regiment of Deng Changqi boarded four special trains at Guotang Jiangcun on the fifth and continued to advance towards Shaoguan. It is planned that the 1st Army can be fully transported by the eleventh of this month. The Transportation Headquarters has been assigning the various armies to the No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 sub-stations in recent days. Yesterday, thirty long-distance buses were requisitioned in the province and sent to Shaole for use. Even the fertilizer-carrying troops in Guangzhou were requisitioned. (September 6)</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: The Guangdong-Guangxi armies' invasion of Hunan has evolved from rumors into reality. Tang Shengzhi's forces under Yan Bogang and Chen Tiejian had already entered Hunan on the 31st of last month. The Guangdong army under Li Yangjing and others also followed closely behind. At the same time, the Guangxi army under Bai Chongxi also mobilized on the 4th of this month, reportedly to join Tang and Li's forces to advance in attack. He Jian returned to the province from Anxiang to inspect the disaster situation on the evening of the 4th. On the 6th, Gu Zhutong, the division commander of the Central Garrison Army, Liu Wendao, the director of the Hubei Civil Affairs Department, Lin Wenwei, the chief of the General Headquarters' Staff Office, and Qiu Wei, the director of the Transportation Department, arrived in Hunan. They immediately held a military conference at the General Headquarters. Gu Zhutong first reported that the Central Government had dispatched elite troops to Hunan to assist in defense, and also dispatched more than one hundred trucks to Hunan to transport troops. Subsequently, they discussed and decided on various military plans for one or two hours. It is rumored that Gu Zhutong may go to Hengzhou to inspect the defenses when necessary. (September 9)</p>
<h3>Zhu-Mao Main Force Completely Collapses</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Engages in Bloody Battles with Red Bandits</p>
<p>Killing Thousands of Bandits, Seizing Thousands of Guns</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: The main forces of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue, the false 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 12th armies, after fleeing to Xingguo, immediately established the false central government at Bailuwei and the false rear hospital in the mountains around Lizengkeng Shangzaobai. The northwest of Xingguo, Taihe, and Wan'an, the southeast of Ganxian and Yudu, and the northeast of Gaoxingwei, Chongxianwei, Shijia Yaotou, and Shacun became the central area of the Red Bandits. In mid-last month, the 19th Route Army under Chen Mingshu, together with Jiang Dingwen's forces, about four or five divisions, totaling 60,000 men, advanced west from Xingguo. At the same time, the Gong and Luo divisions were deployed along the Gan River in Taihe and Wan'an, setting up machine guns and artillery, holding the strategic passes to prevent them from escaping. However, since the armies began their operations, the Red Bandits used banditized civilians as wings and treacherous mountains as shields, evading the substantial and attacking the insubstantial, thus achieving little effect. Recently, the bandits, taking advantage of the government troops' dispersal for search and the continuous rain that made it difficult for aircraft to scout and bomb, concentrated the false 3rd Army of Huang Gonglue, the 4th Army of Lin Biao, the 5th Army of Peng Dehuai, the 12th Army of Luo Binghui, and the 35th Army of Yang Yuebin, about 70,000 to 80,000 men, with 40,000 to 50,000 guns, and fiercely attacked the 60th Division and the 9th Division of the government army northwest of Xingguo. Since the evening of the 7th, they launched more than ten assaults, with extreme ferocity. At that time, the Cai and Jiang divisions of the 19th Route Army calmly fought back without flinching. When the Red Bandits ran out of ammunition and energy, they launched a large-scale counterattack, with machine guns and artillery as dense as firecrackers. It is estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 bandits were killed. The bandits, also suffering excessive casualties, began to collapse. The government army took advantage of the victory to pursue, seizing more than 4,000 guns, four machine guns, and three mortars. At the same time, Jiang Dingwen's forces also encountered the bandit's false 3rd and 4th armies near Baiyang, and both sides engaged in close combat, which was extremely fierce. About 7,000 to 8,000 bandits and regular soldiers fell. Jiang's forces also suffered some casualties due to launching seven or eight assaults on the bandits. As for the bandits who fled south from Ningdu, they were also defeated by the 19th Route Army, which completely occupied Wangwuqian. Chen Mingshu sent a telegram to the province yesterday, briefly stating that from Yu to Jia, he had fought fiercely with Zhu De's main force of about 40,000 to 50,000 men in Gaoxing Chongxian for two days and nights. Fortunately, the soldiers fought bravely and finally defeated the bandits. The corpses of the bandits were all over the mountains and valleys, and the blood flowed into the streams, staining the plants and trees red, which was indeed a great victory since the suppression of the bandits. The bandits fleeing west have no more strength to fight, etc. After the headquarters received Chen's telegram, it immediately announced the victory and ordered Chen to continue to lead his troops to wipe out the remaining bandits to prevent future trouble. Moreover, Donggu is currently guarded by Li Yunheng's division. Li believes that the terrain of Donggu is treacherous, and it is extremely difficult to defend against the remaining bandits in the nearby mountains. Li firmly cleared the fields and defended the strategic passes, and in order to eradicate the roots of the bandits, he burned all the forests and bandit lairs, so that the bandits had nowhere to hide. Now that the bandits' bases are completely lost, even if they flee everywhere, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. (September 10)</p>
<h3>The Flood Situation in Jiangbei Continues to Worsen</h3>
<p>Breaches Difficult to Block</p>
<p>The Number of Disaster Victims Increases Daily</p>
<p>Yangzhou dispatch: The flooded area in Jiangbei this time spans as many as a dozen counties. Although the administrative authorities have repeatedly planned to deal with the breaches, no immediate method of blocking them has been found to date, half a month later. The number of disaster victims is increasing daily, and the relief funds raised are far from meeting the demand. The autumn wind is growing stronger, epidemics are breeding, and bandits are rising up. The current situation is worrying, and it is truly unknown how to properly resolve the aftermath. Here is a record of the dangerous situations in recent days:</p>
<p>In recent days, the river tides have reached their peak, and the Yi River continues to pour in. The breaches cannot be blocked immediately, resulting in daily submersion and irreparable damage. The affected areas include Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, and Taixian, as well as Jiangdu and Gaoyou, which bear the brunt of the dike collapse, and the eastern parts of Baoying, Huai'an, and Huaiyin, and the counties along the river such as Yizheng and Liuhe. In recent days, the number of disaster victims transported to Yangzhou from various places has been increasing. Yangzhou, a small city also affected by the disaster, is facing increasing financial difficulties. Therefore, in the past three days, most of the disaster relief boats heading south from the north have been transferred across the river and dispatched to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and the Su-Chang-Hu area.</p>
<p>Since the breach in the Grand Canal, the water that used to flow south from the north has been transformed into water flowing south from the north below Gaoyou. In recent days, the river tides have pushed the river water inward, directly pouring into the canal, and the Yi River has been rushing straight south like ten thousand horses galloping. The two rivers pass through the twenty-plus breaches in Jiang and Gao counties (a total of twenty-seven breaches, several of which were previously blocked by the Provincial Security Office), and flow east along the gaps, causing the water level in the two counties of Xing and Dong to be level with the city walls. Hundreds of miles around are without a single intact piece of land. Even coffins that have been buried can float on the surface of the water. The ferocity of the water can be seen. As for the water in Gaobao Lake, it is rapidly drying up due to the rapid outflow. Ships passing through the lake often run aground. If the breaches in the eastern dike are blocked immediately, the aquatic products in the lake within a radius of hundreds of miles next year, and the irrigation of the fields along the canal that have not been flooded, will also be sacrificed.</p>
<p>After a great flood, there must be a great epidemic. This has been an unchanging rule for thousands of years. Recently, the autumn wind has been growing stronger, and the disaster victims who have just emerged from the water cannot eat on time and have no fixed place to live. How can they resist external evils? Therefore, many epidemics have been discovered in the various shelters in recent days, mostly vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and chills. At present, in addition to providing food and clothing, there is an urgent need to organize clinics to provide medical treatment. (September 12)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Counties to Protect the Eastern Dam</h3>
<p>The History of the Construction of the Eastern Dam</p>
<p>The Eastern Dam, located in Gaochun County, is related to the water conservancy of the four prefectures of Jiangnan: Su, Song, Chang, and Tai. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs recently received telegrams from Liyang, Wuxian, and other counties, stating that they had heard that the people of Chun were experiencing floodwaters from Anhui and had the intention of opening the Eastern Dam to discharge water eastward. They urgently requested that the counties be ordered to protect the dam. After receiving the telegrams, Chairman Ye immediately instructed Hu, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to send telegrams to the two counties of Chun and Li, ordering them to jointly and closely protect the dam and prevent unruly people from privately digging and releasing water, which would harm the entire province. At the same time, the Security Office was informed to dispatch teams to assist in the defense. As for the issue of water discharge, Jiang Fuqin was commissioned by the department to travel to Gaochun to jointly inspect an appropriate waterway with local officials and gentry and to plan another construction method for discharging the accumulated water in the county, so as to take care of both parties.</p>
<p>The Eastern Dam is located 120 li west of Liyang County and 60 li southeast of Gaochun County, within the territory of Gaochun County. There are two dams, upper and lower, 10 li apart. The upper dam is called the Eastern Dam, and the lower dam is called the Lower Dam. Both are built in the Xu Creek between Gucheng Town and Dengbu. The west of the Lower Dam is called the Upper River, the area between the two dams is called the Middle River, and the east of the Lower Dam is called the Lower River. The Lower River connects Liyang and Yixing in the east and flows into Tai Lake, which is the old course of the Middle River. It is said that this place originally belonged to the boundary mountains between Jiangsu and Anhui and the foothills of Maoshan Mountain, so the terrain within three to five li nearby is quite elevated. During the Spring and Autumn period, the King of Wu attacked Chu and used Wu Zixu's plan to open a river to transport grain, which was then called Xu Creek. Since then, the rivers have been connected, connecting Liangzhe in the southeast and entering the Yangtze River in the west, allowing ships to travel unimpeded. Later, the riverbed gradually silted up. It is also said that the territory of Ning, Xuan, and Guang in Anhui Province is high, and although Gaochun is relatively flat, it is still far above Liyang. When rain accumulates slightly, the mountain sources boil angrily and rush eastward. During long droughts, the source is insufficient, and ships have difficulty passing. Therefore, in the third year of Jingfu in the Tang Dynasty, Yang Xingmi built the Luyang Five Dams between the Eastern Dam and Dengbu to raise the water level in the river when the water was low, so as to facilitate navigation. During the Song Dynasty, the Five Dams gradually fell into disuse, and the water in Gaochun was easily discharged. Many people reclaimed the lakes of Shibai Gucheng as fields. The three prefectures of Su, Chang, and Hu, which were downstream, suffered particularly severe floods. Shan E and Su Shi both advocated building the Five Dams to prevent the water from Xuan, Xin, Jinling, Jiuyang, and the Yangtze River from entering Jingxi and Tai Lake, so that the water in Su and Chang could be reduced by seventy to eighty percent. At that time, the court was planning to develop the lakes and reclaim land, so it was not implemented. During the Yuan Dynasty, the rivers gradually became blocked. In the twenty-fifth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, the Xu Creek River was dredged again, and a stone gate was built to open and close, called Guangtong Town. At that time, the stone gate allowed the water from the lakes to be easily discharged, and a river was opened in the lake to divert the water from the lake and join the Qinhuai River into the Yangtze River. Thus, Su and Zhejiang went directly to Jinling via the Eastern Dam as a waterway. In the first year of Yongle in the Ming Dynasty (1403 AD), the capital was moved to the north, and the waterway was abandoned. Wu Xiang of Su cited Shan E's memorial, arguing that the water was a problem for Su and Chang, and rebuilt the earthen dam, which was the beginning of the construction of the Eastern Dam. However, the dam was still low and thin. In the sixth year of Zhengtong in the Ming Dynasty, the river water flooded, and the dam broke, causing great damage to Su and Chang. The national tax could not be collected, so it was rebuilt and strictly prohibited from releasing water. In the seventh year of Zhengde, it was increased by three zhang. In the thirty-fifth year of Jiajing (1556 AD), Japanese pirates invaded, and merchants traveled through the dam in an endless stream. The residents along the dam benefited from their exploitation and rebuilt another dam about ten li east of the Eastern Dam. The two dams were separated, and the lake water never flowed east again. Later, in the twenty-ninth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (1849 AD), there was a great flood in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the summer. On the twenty-sixth day of the fifth month, the villagers of Gaochun dug the Eastern Dam, and the prefectures of Su, Song, Chang, and Zhen became a vast expanse of water. An earthen dam was hastily built in July, and a stone dam was built in November, which was completed in April of the following year, costing 18,000 taels of silver. Yellow earth, lime, and sand were mixed and pounded together in the stone wall, mixed with glutinous rice juice, called three-in-one soil, to fill it, which was very solid and strong. It was also strictly forbidden to encroach on the dam foundation. Within twelve zhang north and south, it was never allowed to build houses or sheds. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Liyang Water Conservancy Bureau submitted a request to the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau, which forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Governor, to allocate funds from the mu tax to repair the dam. In the sixteenth year, workers were hired to repair the two dams and replace the side stones of the upper dam, costing a total of 20,000 yuan. The old encroachments and sheds were also cleared and demolished. It is still as solid as ever today.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province Requests Additional Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>Request for Additional Allocation of 100,000 Due to the Severity of the Disaster</p>
<p>The flood in Anhui Province is extremely severe, followed by a hurricane, which has further expanded the disaster area. The 170,000 yuan in relief funds previously allocated by the central government has been exhausted. Chen Diaoyuan, chairman of the provincial government, learned that Yan Zhuang, a member of the Central Relief Committee, was about to go to Jiangxi, and specially convened a meeting of all members of the Provincial Relief Committee to discuss the distribution of emergency relief. The previous distribution covered 16 counties in the first-level disaster area, with 15,000 yuan allocated to each of the nine counties including Huaining, and 5,000 yuan to Linhuai. The remaining seven counties had not yet been distributed. He and the Yan Committee telegraphed the Disaster Relief Committee of the Executive Yuan, requesting additional relief funds. Excerpts from the telegram are as follows: (1) The central government allocated 170,000 yuan for emergency relief in Anhui Province. Jing Yuan carried it to Anhui, and according to the disaster situation in various places, it was decided to allocate 4,700 yuan to each of the nine counties of Huaining, Tongcheng, Wangjiang, Dongliu, Tongling, Wuhu, Shouxian, Huoqiu, and Wuhe, and 2,000 yuan for emergency rescue of the moat embankment in the provincial capital. The deficit was supplemented by the provincial government, and the relief methods for each county were determined to rescue the destitute elderly and weak, with each person receiving at least about one yuan in relief funds. The distribution of silver, the distribution of flour, or the establishment of factories to distribute porridge were the three methods. The county governments, together with the county party departments and county disaster relief organizations, weighed the local situation and chose one to implement. However, after the great flood in Anhui Province, the disaster area has been further expanded and the disaster situation has become more severe due to the hurricane. Moreover, the relief funds in the affected areas are often unable to provide universal relief, which seems to be partial and withered. A telegram has been sent to the Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government, requesting an additional 100,000 yuan for emergency relief, to be remitted to Anhui for distribution. (2)</p>
<p>The flood was already extremely severe. According to reports from various counties, nearly 30 counties are classified as first-level and second-level disaster areas. However, Heaven did not tire of inflicting disaster. On the 25th of last month, another hurricane struck, further expanding the disaster area and making the damage even more severe. The 170,000 yuan in emergency relief from the central government has been allocated to the nine counties of Huaining, Tongcheng, Wangjiang, Dongliu, Tongling, Wuhu, Shouxian, Huoqiu, and Wuhe, with 15,000 yuan each, 5,000 yuan to Linhuai in Fengyang, and 4,700 yuan each to the six counties of Wuwei, He County, Xuancheng, Guichi, Fengtai, and Huaiyuan. In addition, 2,000 yuan was allocated for the emergency rescue of the moat embankment in the provincial capital, and the deficit was supplemented by the provincial government. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are limited. Even the disaster areas with the same situation cannot be universally relieved, which seems to be partial and withered. Please quickly allocate an additional 100,000 yuan for emergency relief, to be remitted to Anhui by a certain date for distribution. (September 12)</p>
<h3>Ge Guangting's Conversation After Returning to Qingdao</h3>
<p>There Is No Need to Worry About the Security of North China</p>
<p>The Clearing of the Countryside in Lu-Yu Is About to Begin</p>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaojiao Railway Committee, recently went to Peiping to visit Deputy Commander Zhang, and reported on everything. After finishing his business, he returned to Jinan with Chairman Han, and then accompanied him on a trip to Henan. He returned to Qingdao from Jinan at 7:30 this morning (the 10th). I visited him in the afternoon. According to Ge, Deputy Commander Zhang's health has been improving day by day recently, and he has been receiving guests and working as usual. He will be discharged from the hospital soon. Because the security of North China is important, it has been decided that he will stay in Peiping and will not go anywhere else in the near future. The proposal to return to Liaoning has been cancelled. Regarding the security issue of North China, Deputy Commander Zhang has consulted with generals from all parties several times. The generals all believe that at this time of floods and national crisis, the country cannot afford to start another war. Therefore, no matter what, they are determined to uphold the principle of peace. After this consultation, the security of North China can be consolidated without worry. Chairman Han met with Deputy Commander Zhang several times after arriving in Peiping, and both sides were very happy. I (Ge refers to himself) and Chairman Han are old colleagues, so Deputy Commander Zhang asked me to be the representative in Jinan to facilitate communication. After returning to Jinan with Chairman Han from Peiping, I originally planned to return to Qingdao immediately, but Chairman Han insisted on inviting me to Henan, so I stayed for a few more days. Regarding the clearing of the countryside in Lu-Yu, Chairman Han and Chairman Liu (Zhi) have consulted several times. The clearing methods have been decided and will be implemented soon. As for Yan Xishan, he must go abroad sooner or later. The generals of the Jin army have expressed their firm intention that no matter what, they cannot disrupt the overall situation for personal reasons. Deputy Commander Zhang also believes that if Yan does not leave Shanxi Province for a day, the people will not be at ease for a day. He will urge Yan together with the generals to leave Shanxi as soon as possible, etc. After the conversation, I took my leave. (September 10)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Dispatch</h3>
<p>▲ Wuhu's water level rose significantly again last night, surpassing previous record highs. The elevated planks used for passage were once again submerged, hindering transportation. The Flood Relief Association hosted reporters from various newspapers, with County Magistrate Yu reporting on the Wuhu disaster situation, which differs from other areas. Because more than ten counties inland have accumulated water that must exit through Wuhu, and the river tide is not receding, the water level in Wuhu will take some time to drop. The disaster situation may worsen. Currently, Huangchi has received over 20,000 refugees, and Wuhu has been receiving over a thousand people daily, along with more farmers and cattle. The Flood Relief Association has expedited the establishment of shelters, with He Wuzi and others in charge.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Gongheng, the Central Government's disaster investigation commissioner, along with representatives from the Wuhu Flood Relief Association and the Nanfan Five Counties Flood Relief Charity Association, hired a special boat at 7:00 AM today to investigate the disaster situation in counties such as Fanchang and Nanling.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, considering the rampant banditry along the river in various counties in recent years, which endangers merchants and travelers, specifically ordered the counties to jointly develop joint defense measures. Yesterday at 9:00 AM, representatives from the county governments of Chaoxian, Guichi, Dangtu, Huaining, and Wangjiang, as well as the Provincial Ship Management Office, the Wuhu Shipping Association, and the Datong Public Security Bureau, gathered at the Wuhu County Government to hold a waterborne joint defense conference. County Magistrate Yu Yuying of Wuhu presided over the meeting, reading out the proposals from various counties. A resolution was passed outlining four main areas: joint defense, patrol and investigation, search and suppression, and investigation. It was decided to continue the meeting at 1:00 PM today to determine the implementation methods for the joint defense area.</p>
<p>▲ The export of Wuhu rapeseed, previously resolved through meetings by various sectors, was permitted for shipments to Shanghai. However, yesterday, the Anti-Japanese Association again detained and refused to release the shipments. The Grain Joint Association believes this violates the resolutions of various sectors and affects commerce and workers' livelihoods. They have submitted another request to the Public Security Bureau and the Party Rectification Committee, asking them to order the Anti-Japanese Association not to obstruct rapeseed exports on ships other than Japanese vessels, to avoid causing disputes.</p>
<p>▲ To raise police funding, the Public Security Bureau convened a meeting at 2:00 PM today at the County Chamber of Commerce, gathering gentry, wealthy individuals, and representatives from various businesses. It was resolved to transform the previously established Public Security Maintenance Association into a temporary Public Security Maintenance Association. Fifteen executive committee members, five standing committee members, and seven supervisory committee members were elected on the spot. Funding will be collectively raised by all members. The association headquarters will be located within the County Chamber of Commerce. (November 11th)</p>

Yang Shijie, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, along with a police squad leader, apprehended the bandits Xiang Jusheng and Zhang Fusheng in Fanbang, Fengjing. Today (12th) morning, they were preliminarily interrogated by the Third Section. According to Xiang Jusheng's confession, he is from Qingpu and makes a living as a net fisherman. This March, he and Liu Jinrong (an escaped convict who previously served a seven-year sentence) and Zhang Fusheng stole white rice and clothes from a certain family in Xitang, Jiashan. In July, they stole clothes from Xiao Wu's family in Xifanbang. They then went to the Huimao Building in Fengjing for tea and divided the loot with Zhang Fusheng. They were taken away by the Jiashan Self-Defense Corps, who also confiscated 57 stolen items belonging to Liu Jinrong from Zhang Fusheng's boat. Later, Li Xiuqing, Yao Hefu, and Lin bailed them out separately. The 147 stolen items currently seized were stolen from a certain family in the Youchetou area of the 13th district and Ye Yuquan, etc. Liu Jinrong is currently near Xitang, etc. Zhang Fusheng's confession was similar, except that Liu Jinrong robbed a certain family in Wujiagang, Zhangliantang of 150-160 yuan and raped the 18-year-old daughter of the victim. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be transferred to the Songhu District Pacification Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Wang Renqing Embezzles Funds and Flees with Family. Wang Renqing, who runs the Wang Renji Cotton Firm in Shanghai, resides at No. 78 Pishi Street, Suzhou. Wang suddenly fled with his family from Suzhou the day before yesterday (10th). The First Public Security Bureau learned of this and sent police officers to investigate. They found the Wang family's doors locked from the inside. The house had three courtyards and was empty. The indoor furniture was in disarray, and all valuables and clothing had been taken away. The following day (11th), Zhu, a representative from the Shanghai Fojia Foreign Firm, came to Suzhou and told the bureau chief that Wang Renqing owed the firm over 50,000 taels of silver, as well as tens of thousands of taels to other banks. Based on the report, the bureau determined that the case involved financial debts and should be transferred to the judiciary. In the meantime, police officers were dispatched to guard Wang's empty house.</p>

<p>A Large Number of Refugees Arrive at Beiqifang. Yesterday morning, over a hundred refugees from Jiangbei, including men, women, children, and the elderly, arrived at Beiqifang, Qingcheng, a county belonging. They arrived in over ten awninged boats and immediately went to various villages to beg for food, causing some disturbances. They also took chickens and ducks without permission, totaling nine large baskets and 270 heads. They then went to Sihekou, Jiangyin County, and had a brawl with the villagers. They were later suppressed by the armed Qingyang Self-Defense Corps and left.</p>
<p>Privately Manufacturing Counterfeit Currency, the Criminal is Sentenced to Imprisonment. Pan Renbiao from Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, residing at No. 4 Library Road in the city, had been privately manufacturing lead-based silver dollar coins for some time. On the 8th of last month, the First Public Security Bureau received a tip-off and Chief Gao sent officers to search the premises, finding four counterfeit currency molds, chemicals, white powder, and other items. Pan Renbiao was arrested and taken to the bureau, then transferred to the county court for trial and detained until now. Yesterday, Judge Yang interrogated him again and sentenced him to two years and six months of imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan. After the appeal period, he will be sent to prison to serve his sentence. The Silk Factory Illegally Collects Cocoons Without a License. Dafeng Silk Factory, located behind Zhang Yuan'an in Nanmenwai, collected cocoons without a license and raised the price of fresh cocoons to 120 yuan per dan. This was discovered by Yongtai Silk Factory, a nearby competitor, which sent its factory supervisor, Jin Liang, to dissuade them. For some reason, an argument broke out with Chen Peiqing, the cocoon collector from Dafeng, which escalated into a physical altercation, and Ma Jinliang was injured. Yongtai's manager, Xue Runpei, reported this to the Third Public Security Bureau. Chief Wang Weixin of the bureau summoned both parties to the bureau for questioning and then submitted the case to the General Bureau, which transferred it to the county court for trial. In addition, Hu Xingchang Cocoon Firm in Guting Temple, District 5, violated the resolution of the Cocoon Industry Association by continuing to collect cocoons as usual. This was reported to the association, which requested a fine of 500 yuan to be used for flood relief. It is also heard that the Cocoon Industry Association has now decided on the price of autumn cocoons, with a maximum of 70 yuan per dan, and no further price increases are allowed.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>

The reports have now been submitted, totaling 331,375 mu of flooded farmland. County Magistrate Zhang and Finance Bureau Chief Qian Zhaoda reported this to the provincial government on the 11th for verification and review.</p>
<p>Three Notorious Robbers Executed by Firing Squad. Sun Guanglin, Zhi Quan, Da Peng, Pansheng, and three other notorious robbers involved in the robbery case in Wantta, Wuyi, which resulted in fatalities, were apprehended by detectives sent by the county government.

On the morning of the 12th, at 7:00 AM, the three criminals were taken to the execution ground in Fengweidun and executed by firing squad after verifying their identities.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Over Two Thousand More Disaster Victims Arrive from Xinghua. On the 11th, over a thousand more disaster victims from Xinghua and Dongtai were transported by ship. Another 1,086 people are en route and are expected to arrive at 10:00 AM on the 12th. The charity halls, guild halls, and temples inside and outside the city of Tong are full of women and children, totaling over 300 people, who have all been sheltered at the Guichi Guild Hall. On the 11th, the Nantong Relief Association used the Daxun ship to transport 1,700 bags of flour and a large amount of dry food to Dongtai.</p>
<p>The Autumn Tide Along the River Poses a Serious Threat. The dikes and embankments along the river in Nantong have been breached in seven places by the high tide and are currently being repaired urgently. Since the 11th, the autumn tide has been particularly strong. Furthermore, due to the meteorological station's warning of an impending hurricane, farmers along the embankments are greatly alarmed and have gathered day and night to protect the riverbanks, preparing for emergency repairs with tree branches and sandbags to prevent disasters.</p>
<p>The Case of Converting Copper Coins to Silver Dollars to be Resolved by the Judiciary. The Nantong Education Fund has traditionally been deposited in money houses and pawnshops for interest, using copper coins. In recent years, there has been a heated dispute over the conversion to silver dollars, which has now led to litigation. The provincial government has instructed the county government that this case should be resolved by the judiciary and that the administrative department should cease to handle it.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Requesting the Allocation of 20,000 Dans of American Loan Wheat. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines believes that Jiangsu Province has been hit by continuous rainstorms, causing the collapse of dikes in many places, resulting in widespread death and displacement. Urgent relief is only a temporary solution. Soon, the upstream water will recede, and winter planting should be quickly planned to remedy the situation. However, farmers are currently without food, let alone seeds. Therefore, yesterday, they telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and requested the advance allocation of 20,000 dans of American wheat under the American loan program, dispatching personnel to Jiangsu or handing it over to the department to find ways to transfer suitable wheat varieties from counties with lighter disasters to farmers in counties with severe disasters, so that they can be released as scheduled.</p>
<p>Regulating the Financial Situation in Jiangbei. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the local Money Industry Association, stating: "Most of the commercial transactions in this city are in Jiangbei, and most of the loans from money houses are in Jiangbei. This year, Jiangbei has suffered an unprecedented disaster, the likes of which have not been seen in over a hundred years. The commercial situation is self-evident. The money houses in this city should provide special support to the merchants in Jiangbei with whom they do business, so that they can breathe a little easier and find ways to turn around. If they are given due consideration, the debts will have hope of being repaid. If the facts are ignored and they are too rigid, they may become overly anxious, which will inevitably lead to a collapse of the copper mountain and an echo in the Luoyang bell. This is detrimental to people, harmful to oneself, and has a very significant impact on the market."</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>A Woman Snatching Incident in Donghe Village Results in Death. Zhang Defu, a Yangzhou native residing in Donghe Village, South Township, is a leather craftsman. His daughter, Qiaoyun, was betrothed to a member of the Sun family. The wedding date was set. Unexpectedly, on the 27th of last month, Dai Heshang, a local rogue from the same village, gathered a group of people to forcibly snatch her as his wife. Defu tried to stop them, but was beaten and injured. After the incident, he reported it to the Seventh Public Security Bureau in Jiuli. Chief Lin specially sent a senior police officer to rescue her, but he was also beaten. Chief Lin immediately reported the situation to the General Bureau. Chief Zou Wusan specially sent Inspector Zuo, along with armed police officers and detectives Ding Genglong, etc., to arrest the culprits. The criminal Dai Heshang specially enlisted the help of an old man, Ma Xingxiang, to intercede with the police. A conflict broke out between the two sides, resulting in Ma Xingxiang being shot three times. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but died. After receiving the report, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send Ding Genglong, Liu Zhenxiang, Xu Damao, and others who went to make the arrests to the court for trial. Judge He Chengshen opened the court for trial and temporarily detained them, awaiting the summoning of the parties and armed police officers to clarify the situation before rendering a decision.</p>
<p>Villagers Cause Trouble While Singing Tanhuang. On the evening of the 8th of this month, villagers Ding Jinrong, Ding Shusheng, and others from Pushe Village, West Township, led the singing of Tanhuang, attracting many people. After receiving the report, the Ninth District Office sent trainer Yang Shengbo, along with members of the local militia and Village Chief Ding Lianfa, to investigate and make arrests. Yang Youshou was captured on the spot, but Ding Jinrong incited the onlookers to snatch him away, tearing the uniforms of the trainer and militiamen and dispersing in a flurry. District Chief Zhang specially reported the matter to the county government for review.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Eighteen Refugees Tragically Drown. Outside the South Gate of this city, around 7:00 PM last night, 23 refugees were taking a ferry to Xiaohexi to seek food at Nan's house. Because the boat was small and there were too many people, it capsized in the center of the Lian River due to the wind and waves. It is reported that five people were rescued, and 18 drowned. It was a tragic event.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims from Hubei Province Arrive in Ningbo. In front of Yanqing Temple, South Gate of Ningbo, suddenly arrived over 200 disaster victims from Tianmen County, Hubei Province, including men, women, and children. Among the refugees, only about ten were able-bodied men, with the rest being women and children. They were emaciated, dressed in rags, and looked very pitiful. It is said that over a thousand people originally fled to Shanghai, but some of the refugees got separated. Unable to find a solution, they boarded a ship to Ningbo to seek relief. Li, a staff member of District 1, Branch 1, learned of the situation and personally went to inspect, instructing them not to be separated. He also reported to County Magistrate Chen by telephone. Yesterday morning, County Magistrate Chen sent the director of the relief center and Li to investigate, ordering them to stay there temporarily. Efforts are currently being made to provide relief.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Intercepted While Smuggling Rice by Sea. Shen Jiafu, a pig butcher from Yaoqian Kan town, started his business by trading in rice and wheat. He has now accumulated over 100,000 yuan. However, he is still not content and took advantage of the recent wind and flood disasters to purchase a large amount of rice and wheat, hoping to smuggle it overseas. He was discovered by the East District Maritime Protection Corps with over 500 bags and reported to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Boats Robbed Near Qianqing. On the night of the 10th, two night boats traveling from Shaoxing to Xixing were robbed in the Xixiaojiang River near Qianqing, East Township, Xiaoshan. Three pirate ships stopped and boarded them, robbing all the passengers of their clothes, quilts, and over 70 silver dollars. The boatman, A Wei, was shot and wounded in the leg.</p>
<p>New Cotton Harvest is Hopeless, Cotton Prices Soar. The cotton fields in the eastern township of Xiaoshan have all been hit by wind and rain, and almost completely submerged. Except for a few hundred mu near the ponds, which may yield 40-50% of the harvest, the rest is hopeless. Due to the limited output of new cotton and the fact that old stock has long been exhausted, the market price of cotton has been soaring in recent days. The Anchang and Guali cotton shops are now pricing cotton at 17 yuan per 100 jin for ordinary cotton and 20 yuan for high-quality white cotton, and there is no cotton available.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Red Bandits in Yingshan About to be Exterminated. Yingshan County in Anhui Province, bordering Luotian in Hubei Province, was recently captured by bandits, resulting in many deaths and injuries. According to sources from the county, on the 30th of last month, a large group of Red Bandits from Huoshan infiltrated Yingshan from the eastern and western townships. The garrisoned teams were scattered. At 8:00 AM on the 1st, the bandits attacked the county seat. The 337th Regiment of the garrison fought fiercely for a day. Although the bandits suffered heavy casualties, their numbers were estimated to be over ten thousand. In the evening, the county seat was captured. Regiment Commander Zhang was captured. County Magistrate Huang Dianwen, Public Security Bureau Chief Fang, County Rectification Committee members Li and Wang were all killed. After occupying the city, the bandits divided into two groups, leaving only about 2,000 people stationed in the city, coercing residents along the countryside to establish village farmers' associations, slaughtering, looting, and causing tens of thousands of people to flee. The autumn harvest, which was ripe, was confiscated by the Red Bandits and transported to the Huoshan bandit den in an endless stream. The county's self-defense corps was previously under the command of the Song Brigade. Later, Lu's regiment attached the 136th team to block the border between Yingshan and Taihu, and the regiment's 245th team drove to Dianqianhe, Taifu, to wait for orders, and to scout the bandit situation from time to time. The bandits in the two divisions have been killed by Xu and Xia's divisions, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Previously, your newspaper's advertisement section on July 3rd carried an advertisement for the Production and Consumption Survey Institute's recruitment, which included a solemn statement: "On June 7th, Wang Pixian, a fellow villager who studied in Japan, and the Production and Consumption Survey Institute of the Ministry of Interior, appointed me as a physical examination committee member," Upon reading this, I was shocked. This Ministry does not have a Production and Consumption Survey Institute. The fact that Wang Pixian dared to use its name to attempt fraud is illegal. As this concerns the reputation of the Ministry, we have consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation. It replied that it had dispatched officers to investigate. Yin Muqi claimed that Wang Pixian was from Changzhou and a former classmate who studied in Japan. He was staying at the Jiuhua Hotel in Shanghai. However, by the time the police arrived at the hotel, he was no longer there. In addition to ordering a continued investigation to apprehend him, we have replied to your newspaper for verification and publication in the letters section, so that the public may know the truth. Sincerely, Ministry of Interior, September 11th.</p>

<h3>Flood Disaster and Future Chinese Water Conservancy Problems</h3>
<p>Shen Yi</p>
<p>Post-flood relief is certainly important, but the most crucial element remains a long period of peace within the country. Strictly speaking, this flood is purely a result of the internal strife of the past twenty years and is not an accidental event. Readers, consider: if there had been no internal strife, how could water conservancy projects across the country have fallen into such disrepair? If water conservancy projects had not been so neglected, even in the face of a flood, how could we have been so helpless this time? To be a nation in the 20th century and still suffer floods every year is a rare occurrence in the world. Our country, still claiming to be a civilized nation, must consider how to wash away this shame.</p>
<p>I once vowed to study historical materials on the Yellow River and compile a chronology to clarify the traces of its governance and chaos. In doing so, I read various local gazettes and old Chinese water conservancy books and came across a very interesting fact: the rise and fall of water conservancy is, in reality, mutually causal with the governance and chaos of successive dynasties. For example, during the Tang Dynasty's 288 years, there were 32 Yellow River disasters, averaging one every nine years. In the Yuan Dynasty's 108 years, there were 91 Yellow River disasters, averaging more than one per year. Even without comparing the politics of the Tang and Yuan dynasties in other aspects, this alone can give us a general idea. In a peaceful country, the authorities have the spare capacity to attend to water conservancy, and water conservancy flourishes. Otherwise, with constant disturbances, even if they have the intention, they lack the power. From this perspective, can the frequency of floods since the founding of the Republic be said not to be due to internal strife? Therefore, to eliminate floods, one must seek long-term peace for the country, so that construction projects can proceed in an orderly manner. If this is the case, and water conservancy does not flourish, and floods continue to occur as they do today, who would believe it?</p>
<p>Although the government could not prevent this flood beforehand, it must make efforts to remedy it afterward. And the so-called post-disaster remedy is not just temporary disaster relief but the prevention of future disasters. In the autocratic era of the past, when a major flood occurred, the monarch could not avoid issuing a decree of self-reproach. Although this was somewhat staged, it could not be said not to be a kind of expression of responsibility. Local officials at the time would personally pray to Heaven for divine assistance. Although the practice was foolish, it was nonetheless an expression of responsibility. This kind of expression is certainly not worth emulating, nor is it something to be discussed today. However, the government must take responsibility for the occurrence of such events and their aftermath. There is no difference between the past and the present. Today's government expresses its responsibility for the flood by striving to prevent future floods, in addition to disaster relief. The way to prevent future floods is nothing other than the construction and repair of water conservancy projects in peacetime. As the saying goes, "The overturned cart ahead is a warning to the cart behind," and "The past cannot be追, but the future can still be caught up with." This is what it means.</p>
<p>According to newspaper reports, this flood was most severe in the Yangtze River basin, followed by the area north of the Yangtze, where the flooding was also significant. The Yangtze River has always been known as a river that brings benefits and not harm. However, judging from recent conditions, this is far from the case. Taking the section from Hankou to Wusong as an example, every winter and spring, the water level becomes shallow due to siltation. Ships with a slightly deeper draft can often only reach Wuhu. Above Wuhu, goods must be transferred to barges. The depth of the problem is not something that has occurred overnight. As for the major flooding in Wuhan this time, it is even more shocking. The reasons for this are nothing more than the failure to maintain water conservancy projects in recent years, the increasing siltation of the mainstreams and tributaries, and the encroachment of private individuals on the islands and sandbars in the water storage areas of various lakes, leaving no room for the water, which then bursts its banks and causes disaster. In addition, the amount and area of rainfall in various places during July and August this year were unusually high. The upstream areas also lacked forests and appropriate engineering works. The water rushed down rapidly, causing flooding that was impossible to resist. The three towns of Wuhan, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, experienced simultaneous rises in the mainstreams and tributaries. Even if the dikes were very solid, it is feared that under such circumstances, the floodwaters could still overflow the dikes. Moreover, the dikes themselves were originally very weak. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River have many lakes, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. Normally, the lake surfaces are vast, and the rivers run crisscross. Whenever the Yangtze River is in high flood, the water is stored in the lakes, which reduces the force of the flood. When the water recedes, the stored water is gradually discharged, so that the water source does not dry up. Therefore, the increase and decrease in its water volume changes with the rise and fall of the Yangtze River. It is nothing less than a natural reservoir for the Yangtze River. In the past, the Yangtze River was able to avoid flooding mainly for this reason. Unfortunately, since the late Qing Dynasty, various provinces have established sand field bureaus that have indiscriminately sold water lands without regard to the impact on waterways. Their work was not aligned with water conservancy agencies, and their goals were completely contradictory. In such a situation, it would be truly rare for floods not to occur. The management of water, like the treatment of illness, requires careful examination and cannot be based on guesswork. Therefore, how to manage the Yangtze River in the future cannot be decided by a few words right now. However, speaking in principle, the Yangtze River itself and all its tributaries must be dredged separately. The dikes along the Yangtze River must be repaired and protected separately. The original functions of the various lakes that store water must be restored. In other words, the encroached lands, regardless of whether they were legally obtained, should all be returned to the water if they conflict with the management plan. In addition, the affairs of the sand field bureaus should be transferred to the competent water conservancy agencies to ensure that the work is not contradictory. The latter is not only true for the management of the Yangtze River, but it is also necessary to find ways to correct this situation in any place where it exists. After the occurrence of this flood, someone mentioned a saying of Mr. Zhang Jian from the past, which meant that if the Huai River was not properly diverted, Wuhan would inevitably be submerged one day. Unfortunately, today his words have come true, which cannot be said not to be a coincidence. As a result, there are sighs about the fact that the Huai River was not tamed and managed earlier. Some people also believe that the proposal to divert the Huai River has been advocated for a long time, and the disputes over whether it should enter the Yangtze River or the sea have not been resolved in a single day. If the plan recently set by the Huai River Diversion Committee is followed, it will focus on entering the Yangtze River. Now that the Yangtze River is suffering from flooding, if the Huai River is added to it, would it not be even worse? Therefore, from the experience of this flood, it is still possible to fully research and consider the plan before it is implemented. This may not be a great stroke of fortune. In my opinion, if Mr. Zhang Jian had said this, he would have meant diverting the Huai River into the sea. He meant that if the Huai River does not enter the sea, it will inevitably enter the Yangtze River. Once the Yangtze and Huai Rivers both rise, the Yangtze River will be pushed up by the Huai River, and its momentum will be great, so Wuhan will be in danger. However, as far as I know, this flood in Wuhan is not entirely the fault of the Huai River. If the diversion of the Huai River into the Yangtze River had already become a reality, then the flooding around Nanjing would not have been as severe as it is today, and the flood disaster in the area north of the Yangtze River would not have been as serious as it is today. This is what I dare to say. This statement may seem unreasonable at first glance, but in fact, without the diversion of the Huai River, most of its floodwaters would have no other way to be discharged except into the Yangtze River. Once it is diverted, the Hongze Lake can store part of the Huai River's floodwaters, and the diversion into the sea can divert part of them. In this way, the amount of water entering the Yangtze River during a flood can be much less than it was in the past. People today do not examine this carefully. When they hear that the Huai River Diversion Plan advocates first managing the route into the Yangtze River, they immediately think it is not possible. They do not know that even if the route into the Yangtze River is not managed, the Huai River still enters the Yangtze River every day without any restrictions. The amount entering the Yangtze River even accounts for the vast majority of the Huai River's water. The reason why the Huai River is causing disaster today is precisely this. Let us say that the diversion of the Huai River into the Yangtze River must be opposed. However, no one has paid attention to the fact that it is entering the Yangtze River without being diverted. Is this not strange? Some may say that this is why they advocate diverting the Huai River into the sea. In my opinion, diverting the Huai River into the sea is certainly possible in terms of engineering. What needs to be studied is whether it is economical and whether it is within the capacity of the country today. According to the Huai River Diversion Committee's plan, in addition to diverting the Huai River into the Yangtze River, it also considers diverting it into the sea and using the Hongze Lake to build a flood storage reservoir to limit the flow of the Huai River into the Yangtze River during a flood, so that the flood level of the Yangtze River will not be affected. If the above ideals can all be realized in fact, then this plan should not only not be shaken by this flood but should also be implemented more quickly as a result.</p>
<p>However, is it easy to talk about diverting the Huai River? To divert the Huai River without considering the Yellow River is equivalent to not diverting it at all. Two years ago, I wrote an article on diverting the Huai River and managing the Yellow River, which was published in various newspapers. I described the close relationship between the Yellow and Huai Rivers and the danger of the current state of the Yellow River. I believed that if one does not want to divert the Huai River today, so be it. If one wants to divert the Huai River, one must first manage the Yellow River. There is no way to seek temporary peace without managing the Yellow River. However, people in Jiangsu and Anhui have a very mistaken view, which is that the Yellow River has not had the possibility of invading the south since it moved north and diverted into the Ji River into the sea in the fifth year of Xianfeng. Ding Xian of Shanyang seems to have once made this statement. However, according to my speculation, Ding Xian was one of the most vocal advocates of diverting the Huai River. At that time, he saw the Yellow River moving north and believed that this was the only good opportunity to divert the Huai River. However, the intensity of the disaster caused by the confluence of the Yellow and Huai Rivers was still fresh in the memory of the people along the Huai River. If a way was not found to eliminate their psychological fears, the resistance to diverting the Huai River would be considerable. Therefore, he intentionally made the statement that the Yellow River would not come south again after moving north. This was probably Ding Xian's deliberate cleverness. With Ding Xian's intelligence and knowledge, how could he not know that the Yellow River's frequent invasions of the Huai River, since it could move north in the past, why could it not return south in the future? People today do not examine this and still believe it to be true, which is truly regrettable. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, when the Yellow and Huai Rivers merged, those who managed the rivers, such as Chen Xuan, Pan Jixun, Liu Daxia, and Jin Fu, either built high dikes, constructed the Taihang Dike, or created water-constricting dikes outside Yuntiguan. These people were broad-minded and had well-thought-out plans. However, once the Yellow River breached to the north, all their efforts were in vain. Therefore, even if one wants to bury one's head and talk about diverting the Huai River today, even if the Huai River is indeed diverted, how can one guarantee that the Yellow River will not invade the south? As the ancients said, "Those who manage a hundred li of a river should have their sights set on a thousand li away, and those who manage the river in front of them should calculate a hundred years into the future." This is what it means. Since the Yellow River moved north and diverted into the Ji River into the sea, the harm to the Ji River has been equal to the harm to the Huai River when it was diverted in the past. In recent years, breaches have often occurred in the Shandong area, which proves that the tail end is not smooth and has reached its limit. If this continues, the tail end will become increasingly unsmooth, and the water will have nowhere to go. Its momentum will inevitably breach its banks, and the events of Tongwaxiang in the fifth year of Xianfeng will inevitably be repeated today. I only hope that my words are not true; otherwise, the intensity of the disaster will be no less than this flood. I am not fond of making alarmist statements. The lessons of the past are all there. I cannot hide them. I simply do not understand why people throughout the country pay attention to other rivers but are so indifferent to the Yellow River. Are they going to wait for a disaster to occur before talking about management? This is truly something I cannot bear to know. Foreign experts hired to come to China, such as Freeman, Fang Xiu, and the engineering team of the American Red Cross, came for the purpose of diverting the Huai River. However, reading their reports, one can see between the lines that they all regard managing the Yellow River as more urgent than diverting the Huai River. Freeman said in his Plan for the Management of the Huai River, "The author has always regarded saving the Yellow River, the great disaster of China, as his only concern." The report on diverting the Huai River by the engineering team of the American Red Cross contains the following statement: "The Yellow and Huai Rivers may in fact be able to merge again. If so, all engineering works will be destroyed. For this reason, the engineering team believes that this report cannot be considered complete unless the relationship between the Yellow and Huai Rivers is studied in detail." Professor Fang Xiu, a German consultant to the Huai River Diversion Committee, also said in his report, "The problem that is most closely related to diverting the Huai River is the Yellow River problem. If the Yellow River breaches to the south again, the entire effort to divert the Huai River will be in vain." Alas, if the Yellow River breaches to the south, it will inevitably carry the waters of the Huai River into the Yangtze River. It will not only render the entire effort to divert the Huai River in vain but will also make the future management of the Yangtze River and all post-flood relief problems increasingly complex. What I feel is dangerous, I dare not hide it. I hope that those in the country who are concerned about water conservancy will take a look at it in addition to rushing to provide disaster relief.</p>

<h3>The First Day of the Shanghai Municipal Games</h3>
<p>Solemn Opening Ceremony, Male and Female Athletes Show Their Skills</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu's Women's Long Jump Sets a New Shanghai Record</p>
<p>Today's Track and Field Events Include Seventeen Finals, Tennis Begins, and Soccer and Volleyball Continue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Municipal Games, which had been heavily publicized, opened yesterday at 1:00 PM. With a clear breeze, refreshing air, and spectators gathering, the thin clouds in the sky and the proud, piercing sun were perfect for sports. The bells rang twice, signaling the completion of the opening ceremony. Track and field athletes, soccer players, and volleyball players competed in their respective fields, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Venue</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at the China Track and Field Stadium. Spectators began to arrive in droves at 12:00 PM. Boy Scouts checked admission tickets at the gate, while most of the athletes had already arrived before noon, either rubbing their legs and resting in the waiting area or jogging slowly on the track to loosen their muscles. The command platform on the west side of the track was filled with prizes, including silver trophies, silk banners, mirror stands, and medals, all shining brilliantly. Guests included representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, bureau directors, Chu Minyi, Wang Xiaolai, and more than forty others. The audience surrounded the stands, with the most people on the west side, followed by the east side, and the fewest on the north side, totaling about seven or eight thousand people. The soccer field and volleyball court each had over a thousand people as well. The venue's order was maintained by Boy Scouts from various schools, distributed by the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council, and was well-organized.</p>
<h3>Grand Parade</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony began at 1:00 PM, starting with a parade around the track. The order was as follows: the Public Security Bureau band led the way, followed by the most important guests, staff, female athletes, and finally, male athletes bringing up the rear. Wang Zhuangfei, holding a megaphone in front, gave commands, while Huang Shengbai and Yu Jiajun, holding the Party and national flags, led the way. The large group of people proceeded in an orderly fashion, circling more than half the track, with over seven hundred people. Videographers and photographers followed closely, filming and photographing, creating a busy scene.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>After the entire group paraded from in front of the command platform back to the original location, the athletes lined up on the track. Officials, guests, and staff took their seats. Everyone stood solemnly, sang the Party song, paid respects, and finished reading the will. Then, Chairman Zhang Yuejun gave a speech, followed by a speech by the Municipal Party Committee representative, Tong Xingbai, a speech by Chu Minyi, and finally, a report by Vice Chairman Xu Peihuang. The details of each are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman Zhang's Speech: "Distinguished instructors, guests, male and female athletes, the Municipal Games were held once last year in March. Now, we are holding the Second Municipal Games and, in accordance with the regulations, will select representatives for the National Games in the twentieth year of the Republic. Today is the opening day of the Games. The sky is high and the air is crisp, and the beautiful autumn light is the perfect time to try out your skills. The enthusiasm of the participants and the joy and excitement of the general audience all prove that the citizens' enthusiasm for physical education is significantly more enthusiastic than in the first Games, there has been significant progress compared to the first Games. In the future competition, there will be even more new records. This good phenomenon is very gratifying. There are three points that I, as the Chairman, still cannot refrain from mentioning:</p>
<p>First, we should focus on the spiritual aspect. Our national spirit has been lost for a long time. In recent years, we have been trying to save and revitalize it, and we have come to realize that to restore the national spirit, we must start by focusing on physical education. Therefore, sports meetings at the provincial and municipal levels and the National Games have been held in succession, and although they have achieved considerable results, the spiritual aspect has not yet reached a sufficient and satisfactory level. Therefore, whenever we encounter natural disasters, man-made calamities, foreign aggression, or internal strife, we cannot stop or melt them with the entire national spirit so that they will never be seen again under the blue sky and white sun. Although this sufficient and satisfactory entire national spirit cannot be achieved overnight, we must be down-to-earth and move forward step by step to achieve the final success. It is hoped that all participants will strive to be strong, show their skills, and not give up halfway in every sport, regardless of the result. They must implement their ideas and persevere to create new records, promote our national spirit, and use this spirit to save the nation, save the world, and save humanity, so that they can create a new career.</p>
<p>Second, we should focus on the moral aspect. Sports meetings should first focus on the spirit, but the moral aspect should not be neglected, especially the integration of the spirit into morality. In ancient China, there was archery, which emphasized courtesy and respect, with absolutely no room for deception or usurpation. Today's sports meetings have the same purpose and meaning as ancient archery. Although the nature is competitive, the purpose is still sports. Participants will inevitably have a desire to compete, but they should not harm others to benefit themselves. They should all abide by the regulations and obey orders. Any outrageous actions or immoral behavior will be rejected by the entire meeting. Moreover, attention should also be paid to maintaining order at this grand venue with so many participants. If the above is understood by everyone, the result will naturally be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Third, we should focus on skills. The purpose of sports meetings is to compete in skills, but if there are shortcomings in the spiritual or moral aspects, the original intention of the sports meeting will be lost. Therefore, we first emphasize the spirit, then morality, and finally skills. I hope that all participants will reflect on the situation of the last sports meeting. In the positive aspect, they should of course strive to improve on all the achievements of the last time. In the negative aspect, they should ensure that all the previous shortcomings do not happen again. Most importantly, the results of the competition will inevitably have winners and losers. The winners should not be complacent and should continue to strive for perfection to prepare for the National Games in the future and win glory for the city. Those who do not win should not be discouraged and lose heart. Failure is the mother of success, and they should continue to work hard. If their skills are truly excellent, they will naturally stand out.</p>
<p>All participants should pay close attention to the above three points. Furthermore, many officials and staff from various agencies under the municipal government have participated in amateur sports. Although the results cannot be predicted, this courageous spirit truly demonstrates their enthusiasm for sports. The city has high hopes for them."</p>
<h3>Parade in Formation</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Committee Representative Tong Xingbai's Speech: "Chairman, athletes, guests, representatives, today I am representing the Municipal Party Committee to participate in the Shanghai Second Municipal Games, and I feel very happy. Chairman Zhang has spoken in detail about the important points of the Games, so there is no need for me to elaborate. I would like to offer a few minor points: (1) Sports should be universal, not limited to a part. Usually, those who participate in competitions at sports meetings are all school students, and among the students, only a minority of the entire school participates. Those who love sports in elementary school stop in middle school, those who love sports in middle school stop when they enter university, and those who love sports in university stop when they enter the workforce. In this situation, how can the popularization of physical education be easy? I now hope that those of you who have a solid foundation in sports will develop and promote it. (2) Sports should be sustainable, not temporary. Often, many athletes work hard to practice when the sports meeting is approaching, but after the sports meeting, they put it aside lightly, so there is very little benefit to their physical fitness and spiritual cultivation. I hope that after the meeting, regardless of whether you win or lose, you will continue to practice. The above two points are well known to everyone, and I am not afraid to be verbose because I want to ask everyone to never forget them."</p>
<p>▲ Chu Minyi's Speech: "Chairman, instructors, athletes, guests, I have just returned from Xinjiang and am very happy to be able to attend this grand event. In this China, where natural disasters and man-made calamities are intertwined, many people want to postpone the sports meeting, and their reasons are sufficient. However, strengthening the body and promoting national spirit are essential for China today. The bodies of the average Chinese person seem to be too weak, so they lack the drive to take initiative. If the badge of "sick man" given by foreigners can find a way out through sports, transform the body, and create a healthy individual, then they can serve the Party and the country. For example, I was able to travel tens of thousands of miles to the Northwest and return safely thanks to my daily training."</p>

<p>"I hope that all athletes will show their training efforts in this meeting and then go to the National Games to get a good position to show the true spirit of Shanghai."</p>
<p>▲ Vice Chairman Xu's Report: "Chairman, guests, staff, athletes, the purpose of this sports meeting is to promote physical education for all citizens and to select representatives for the National Games. According to statistics, the number of participants in the track and field events is 248 men and 72 women, in swimming 64 men and 9 women, in tennis 39 men and 5 women, in soccer 9 teams, in baseball 4 teams, in volleyball 4 men's teams and 6 women's teams, in basketball 11 men's teams and 3 women's teams, and in Chinese martial arts over 100 people. The distribution of championships is as follows: men have track and field, all-around, swimming, soccer, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and baseball, for a total of nine categories. Women have track and field, swimming, basketball, tennis, and volleyball, for a total of five categories. Chinese martial arts has wrestling, fencing, and pugilism for both men and women. The dates are from today to the 19th. I am deeply grateful to the officials, representatives of the Municipal Party Committee, representatives from all walks of life, sports figures, and journalists for their enthusiastic support in making this event a success. The two days after the meeting, the 19th and 20th, are the dates for the health and sports competition for municipal government officials. This move was initiated by the mayor and the heads of various bureaus to promote public sports among all citizens. The technical skills may not be very good, but the spirit is very positive."</p>

<h3>Men's Volleyball: Datong University Wins the Final</h3>
<p>Straight Three Wins Over Datong</p>
<p>Hujiang and Jiaotong Universities Replay This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday's men's volleyball competition consisted of two groups: (1) Daxia University won 3-0 over Datong University, securing the right to compete in the final. (2) Hujiang and Jiaotong Universities tied 2-2. Due to darkness, the game will be replayed today.</p>
<p>(1) Daxia University Wins Over Datong University</p>
<p>Straight Three</p>
<p>21 to 11</p>
<p>Daxia 21 to 16 Datong</p>
<p>21 to 9</p>
<p>Referee: Chen Yuehe</p>
<p>The battle between the two universities was unequal, and Daxia won without much effort. With cooperative attacks, Daxia defeated Datong. Datong's lack of powerful spiking, heavy hits over the net, and frequent out-of-bounds shots resulted in a large difference in scores. In the first set, Daxia won by a large margin, 21 to 11. The second set was fiercely contested, with the score reaching 15 to 14, Daxia only winning by one point. Datong could not continue to catch up and lost. In the third set, Datong was even more overwhelmed, losing 21 to 9.</p>

<p>Hujiang and Jiaotong Universities were evenly matched, and it was difficult to tell who was superior. One can tell by looking at the scores of the four sets, with each set differing by only two or three points. When the four sets were finished, it was already dark, so the referee announced a stop to ensure fairness. The game will be replayed at 10:00 AM today, still with Li Xuefei as the referee. The winner will compete against Fudan University in the afternoon in the semi-final. Yesterday's competition is completely void. The Xingxing Women's Volleyball Team supported Jiaotong University at the venue and was very helpful.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Football Results</h3>
<p>Hua Ling Wins Against Pei Lei Five to One</p>
<p>Zhi Xing Wins Against Western District Three to One</p>
<p>Yesterday's preliminary football matches totaled two games: (1) Hua Ling eliminated Pei Lei five to one; (2) Zhi Xing eliminated Western District three to one. A brief account follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hua Ling Wins Against Pei Lei</p>
<p>Five to One</p>
<p>Hua Ling Team Lineup</p>
<p>Liu Zongde</p>
<p>Yang Guosong, Luo Douwen</p>
<p>Hu Shilang, Wang Boyong, Jia Jiliang</p>
<p>Weng Keqing, Li Pixian, Jia Youliang</p>

<p>Jian Jitao, Wang Weinan, Wang Guangzu</p>
<p>Chen Xuhuai, Liu Shunxia, Dong Songmei</p>
<p>Fan Liang</p>
<p>Referee: Tang Zhongguang</p>
<p>This match should have been considered a forfeit by Pei Lei, as they didn't have enough players and hastily pulled people together to make up the numbers. The referee only discovered this after the match had begun. Fortunately, Hua Ling won; otherwise, there would have been another problem. As a result, Pei Lei was completely overwhelmed, under heavy pressure for the entire ninety minutes. Within five steps, there were no opposing players to be found. Hua Ling swept the field for a time. In the first fifteen minutes, Hua Ling's center forward, Jia Jiliang, scored a goal. Later, Pei Lei had a chance to counterattack, and Hua Ling's left winger, Zheng Zhirong, committed a foul. Pei Lei's center forward, Wang Kezu, kicked in a goal, making the score two to one. Hua Ling's left inside forward, Luo Douwen, received a pass from Wu Jiugao and scored, making it two to two. Pei Lei's inside defender committed a foul, and Jia Youliang scored from a penalty kick. Liu Zongde and Wu Jiugao also each scored a goal, ending the game at five to one.</p>
<p>(2) Zhi Xing Wins Against Western District</p>
<p>Three to One</p>
<p>Zhi Xing Team Lineup</p>
<p>Tu Yushi, Wan Xianghua</p>

<p>Hua Yunlong, Chen Xiaoping, Pan Hejun</p>
<p>Luo Ruitang, Zhang Lide</p>
<p>Jiang Yukun, Qiu Ruilong</p>
<p>This match was much more interesting than the previous one, and the ball moved more quickly, unlike the sluggishness of the previous game, which was completely one-sided. Zhi Xing was the champion of the Chinese Football Association's Chinese Character Group last year. Although some players were absent, the team still looked strong. Although Western District lost, they resisted fiercely. In the first half, Zhi Xing scored two goals, making it two to zero. The left inside forward, Wan Mian, single-handedly broke through the defense, scoring just ten minutes into the game. Then, center forward Gong Yibin hooked the ball to the left from twenty yards away from the goal, scoring a spectacular goal. In the second half, no goals were scored for twenty minutes. When Western District attacked near the goal and there was a scramble, center back Zhang Jinxiang fell and touched the ball, so Western District scored a goal with a penalty kick, bringing the score to two to one. Finally, Zhi Xing's right inside forward, Fang Chaojun, received a pass from Wan Xianghua and easily scored the fourth goal, ending the game at three to one.</p>

<p>(Note) Regarding the second place in the first group of the women's 100-meter semi-final, according to the official record of the track and field recorder, it was Ms. Li Xiaowen, number 302. However, after checking the preliminary results of the women's 100 meters, there was no person with the number 302 who qualified for the final. It must be a mistake. It is probably because it was getting dark during the women's 100-meter semi-final yesterday, and it was not easy for the finish-line judges to see clearly, resulting in this error. We are now recording the official record as is, but we hope that the chief finish-line judge or the chief judge will investigate and correct this so that the correct person can participate in today's final.</p>

<h3>Long Jump Final</h3>
<p>Of the 43 people in the long jump final, as many as 13 were absent. This kind of spirit is very poor. We hope that this kind of situation will not happen again in any sports meeting in this city. Yesterday's long jump final was still barely satisfactory. The four people who got the top positions all jumped over six meters. Wang Jihuai won first place with 6.22 meters. Li Lin also jumped to 6.20 meters. In terms of results, although it cannot be said to be excellent, having such results on a newly repaired and loose runway is not easy. Since the last heavy rain and water accumulation at the Dong Zhonghua Track and Field, the various runways of the field event venue have been uneven. A week ago, workers were hired to repair and loosen the original runway, and more coal ash was added. Although it was rolled frequently, it still could not be used. If today's triple jump is still held in the original location, poor results can be predicted. We hope that the venue department will quickly find a way to remove a thin layer of the loose material on top and then roll it again, so that today's triple jump and the 50-meter long jump in the next few days can have good results. In yesterday's long jump, during the third jump of the preliminary round, Zhong Lianji and Li Lin both had a score of 5.90 meters, ranking sixth. Zhong and Li each made a fourth jump to compete for the right to participate in the final. As a result, Li's luck was high, surpassing Zhong and winning the right to the final, and also winning the second place. In the third jump of the final, he once led the trend with a score of meters 20, exceeding Wang Jihuai. However, during the second jump, Wang opened the horsepower and jumped to a score of 6.32 meters. Li, who was also in the critical stage of the high jump, gave up the long jump and focused on the high jump. Wang won the championship steadily. Hao Chunde and Dong Zhaobin ranked third and fourth. Li Lin finished second. But in the eyes of the reporter, neither Wang Jihuai nor Li Lin are talented in the long jump. Wang's body is too heavy, and it is more suitable for him to practice heavy throwing. I am afraid that in another year or two, his body will become fat and he will not be able to maintain his current state. Li's body is too small, and although his elasticity is good, he suffers a lot and it is difficult for him to achieve special results. However, if Li can give up everything and concentrate on practicing pole vault, then his pole vault results will definitely improve. I don't know if Wang and Li agree.</p>

<h3>Discus Final</h3>
<p>The discus event has been progressing very slowly in Shanghai. Yesterday, this newspaper briefly mentioned it. Yesterday's final was enough to prove that what the reporter said was true. In such a large-scale sports meeting, only two people threw over 30 meters, and most of the other scores were around 25 meters, and even 22 meters. I think it is a strange thing. Although I expected that the results would not be very good, but the average score is so childish. The reporter could not figure out the reason, so I asked Mr. Wang Jihuai, who won the first place in this event. According to Wang, "The reason why the progress of the discus and javelin throw is slower is that practicing the discus and javelin requires a very large venue. When practicing, you must have a partner to help, otherwise it will be quite troublesome to throw back and forth. Therefore, there are fewer people who practice these kinds of sports in schools and in society, so the progress is slow. This situation is not unique to Shanghai, but the same is true everywhere in China. As for the average score of today's discus being particularly low, it is also related to the fact that the summer vacation has just passed and school has only been open for less than ten days. Most athletes lack practice, and the headwind also makes it difficult." The reporter suddenly realized after hearing what Wang said. After checking the roster of yesterday's competition, there were originally 23 people, but 5 people were absent. In the three preliminary rounds, Wang Jihuai ranked first with 30.80 meters, and Luo Chuanxian ranked second with a difference of 21 meters. The next were Fu Boming, Tang Xianhan, Xie Quanhe, Cao Yu, etc. In the three final rounds, the other players made no progress. Only Wang Jihuai threw 32.063 meters in the sixth throw, and the competition ended from then on.</p>
<h3>Women's High Jump Final</h3>
<p>The most interesting thing in yesterday's women's high jump final was the fierce competition between Ms. Zhu Wencheng, Sun Xiaoxia, and Li Shihui for third place. They raised and lowered the bar, and the competition was very fierce. As a result, Ms. Li was the first to be eliminated. Ms. Zhu and Sun continued to compete. In the end, Ms. Zhu won the fourth group, but she had exhausted her strength. In total, Ms. Zhu and Sun jumped more than eleven times to compete for fourth place. You can imagine the scene of the competition at that time.</p>
<h3>Women's Long Jump Final</h3>
<p>Among the 14 female athletes who competed in the long jump final, it was a happy event that three of them jumped over four meters on such a loose runway. There were also many who jumped over 3.80 meters. This is enough to show that the women's long jump event has indeed made progress in recent months. Among them, Ms. Qian Xingsu was the most confident. Except for the first jump, which was 3.99 meters, the other five jumps were all over four meters. In the third jump, she broke Zhang Pingxian's new Shanghai record of 4.30 meters set in the school sports meeting in the first half of the year, and ranked first with a score of 4.36 meters. Ms. Zhang Pingxian seemed to have regressed. Although she jumped over four meters in all three final rounds, her best score was 4.20 meters, which was 10 meters less than her previous score. I don't know if this regression is due to lack of practice during the summer vacation. I hope Ms. Zhang will work hard and set a new record at the National Games to win honor for the team.</p>
<h3>Various Preliminary and Semifinal Races</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were over forty groups of preliminary and semifinal races for both men and women. The frequent malfunctions of the starting pistol mechanism were somewhat disappointing. However, the athletes' spirit was not diminished by this. There are a few things that must be said:</p>
<p>1.  Starting Posture: A portion of the athletes have not yet mastered even the basic starting stance. Both their hands and feet are laughable to watch. Although their participation is commendable, they should also assess their own abilities to see if they are qualified to compete in such a large-scale city-wide sports meet. Otherwise, if one percent of the millions of adults in Shanghai participate in sports, the sports meet would last for one or two months.</p>
<p>2.  Running Shoes: Without running shoes, even a naturally gifted athlete cannot achieve outstanding results in sprints. However, in yesterday's men's 100-meter and 200-meter preliminary races, two individuals wore leather shoes and rubber shoes, respectively, which was extremely ridiculous. Wearing cloth shoes is essentially the same as running barefoot, and participating in sprint races in cloth shoes at a prestigious city-wide sports meet is truly unsightly.</p>
<p>3.  Absences: In yesterday's more than thirty groups of races, over one hundred and thirty people were absent, which is astonishing. Some say this is because no registration fee was collected during registration. I do not know if this is the case. The reporter is unsure.</p>
<p>Petty Details</p>
<p>The intense heat has subsided, and the refreshing autumn breeze has risen. Everyone is filled with energy and joy. On the roads, there is a constant stream of traffic, and the sports field is packed with people. This was the grand scene of yesterday's city-wide sports meet. The results of each competition are recorded in special columns. These trivial and miscellaneous details, however, have no specific category to be placed in, so a separate column called "Petty Details" is created to record them. It is written without any order or priority, pieced together from various sources, simply for the sake of liveliness.</p>
<p>▲ The Grandstand Assembly: There are four grandstands in the entire venue: the command stand, the sound stage, the various office stands, and the first-aid stand. The four stands are connected and adjacent to each other, one next to the other, which can be described as an assembly of stands. Climbing up the steps, the entire venue is in view. The autumn breeze caresses the sleeves, making one feel relaxed and comfortable. Therefore, the four stands are truly the best vantage points in the entire venue. Consequently, there are many spectators who cannot get onto the stands and sigh with longing at the stands below. Both ends of the passage under the stands are enclosed with iron wire mesh, with small doors for entry and exit. However, many people are still unaware of this and try to knock on the gates to enter. The enviable life on the stands is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>The Command Stand Glimmers: The command stand is built with thatched bamboo and reed mats, high and airy, with good ventilation. Standing high above, one feels like an immortal. All the prizes donated by various sectors for this competition are piled on the stand. Shields, trophies, cups, and banners gleam with silver light, arranged neatly and orderly. From afar, one sees only the flashing light, constantly dazzling the eyes. An hour before the closing ceremony, the staff members busily carried them away. Many athletes in the field watched them go, surely wondering who would receive these items.</p>
<p>▲ Loudly Shouting (Boy Scouts Attention): In front of the command stand, there is an electrical sound amplification machine with two loudspeakers on either side. The orders issued from the stand can be heard clearly even by those standing far away. The starter, Shao Ji, has a loud voice and a dignified manner. When he shouts loudly, everyone responds. The phrase "(Boy Scouts Attention)" is his most common phrase. Whenever a competition begins, one can hear the sound amplifier broadcasting: "(Boy Scouts Attention, inspect the spectators and do not let them enter the field.)" And sometimes he shouts loudly, "(Boy Scouts are here to maintain order, not just to watch the competition.)" This seems to have a slightly rousing effect.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of Female Athletes' Attire: Yesterday, there were quite a few female athletes participating in the competition. Their attire varied in color. Among them, the violet upper garments of the East Asia Physical Education College and the green shorts of the Liangjiang Girls' School were the most vibrant and eye-catching. The Wuben athletes wore white upper garments and navy-blue shorts. The attire of the Jinan girls was similar to that of Wuben, except that the blue of the shorts was darker. The green shorts of Liangjiang were trimmed with white stripes. During the races, these white stripes fluttered constantly.</p>
<p>▲ One Bread Shared by Two: Yesterday, there were about one hundred boy scouts serving in the field. The male and female members from Liangjiang and Shanghai Middle Schools were equally divided. Despite the heavy workload and limited manpower, they maintained excellent spirits. However, with so many spectators in the field, maintaining order was not easy. Their hard work is truly commendable. In the afternoon, staff members distributed bread, shouting loudly about bread as they went around the field. Before the shouting had ended, rectangular loaves of bread were already flying through the air. A female boy scout caught a loaf of bread and was about to eat it when a staff member shouted, "(One bread shared by two!)" Therefore, this female boy scout had no choice but to share the bread equally with her companion.</p>
<p>▲ Photographers Eating Dust: There were no fewer than ten photographers in the entire venue, running back and forth busily. However, during the women's long jump competition, most of them sat on the ground, forming a semicircle around the sandpit. Every time a female athlete ran and jumped, the photographers bowed their heads and pressed the shutter. The sound of clicking could be faintly heard. When the competition ended, they all exclaimed, "(Eating a meal of dust!)" This is because every time a female athlete jumped into the sand, she would inevitably kick up some sand.</p>
<p>▲ To Move or Not to Move: After the long jump competition ended, the photographers all requested to take photos of female athletes numbers 316, 348, and 346. The three women linked arms and stood side by side in front of the camera, holding their breath and not moving, waiting to be photographed. At this time, there were also people in the crowd taking motion pictures, vigorously cranking their camera. The photographers taking still pictures constantly shouted, "(Don't move!)" while those taking motion pictures shouted loudly, "(Move, move!)" Those who heard this could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>▲ Spectators Shouting "Bald Head": In the men's track and field high jump competition, there was a student from the merchant marine school, Chen Tianhe, number 35, whose high jump performance was very good. However, this gentleman's head was bald, which was slightly different from others. The spectators on the stands did not shout his number but shouted loudly, "(Bald Head!)" Whenever it was a crucial moment, the shouts of "(Bald Head!)" were incessant, and those who heard it could not help but smile.</p>
<p>▲ Hai Xing Cares About Jiaotong: At 4 PM, Jiaotong University and Soochow University competed in volleyball. Both sides were evenly matched, with skillful offense and defense. The spectators' spirits were greatly boosted. However, among the spectators, Hai Xing was most concerned about Jiaotong University. Whenever Jiaotong University was defeated, the female members of the Hai Xing team would sigh with regret. A sound of "(Ah-yo!)" was leisurely and meaningful. However, when Jiaotong University won, they would wave their hands and feet and cheer incessantly. After Hai Xing's shouts, the audience also showed great joy.</p>

<h3>Luo Bo Cup Final Today: China vs. England</h3>
<p>Around 4 PM at the French Club</p>
<p>2:30 PM: Mixed Doubles Final</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Luo Bo Cup International Tennis Semifinals at the French Club, China defeated Portugal and England defeated Japan. The results were all straight sets. Today, China and England will meet again at the same venue to compete for the championship. At 2:30 PM, the mixed doubles final will be held first, with Canavero and Ms. Corazza facing Bu Tuo and Ms. Firth. Following this, the China-England Luo Bo Cup final will be held. This is also one of the most important international competitions in this tennis season.</p>
<h3>Lin and Qiu Prepared to Win</h3>
<p>Today they battle formidable opponents</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai are two of China's top tennis players. Their doubles partnership is their greatest masterpiece. Yesterday, they defeated the Portuguese doubles masters Canavero and Tafolla, but their full strength was not fully revealed, perhaps waiting for today's final. Their opponents, the British generals Delve and Turk, are highly skilled and experienced, with a long-standing reputation in the tennis world. Today, Lin and Qiu are determined to win and show their prowess. The British doubles team's reputation is at stake, so they will not be easily defeated. A wonderful performance can be anticipated.</p>
<h3>England Eliminates Japan</h3>
<p>Result: 3-0</p>
<p>Delve 6-0 Yongsong</p>
<p>(Eng) 6-0 (Jap)</p>
<p>Turk 6-3 Okashi</p>
<p>▲ Strength Too Disparate: Delve has been in Shanghai for only a short time, but his reputation has grown rapidly. His skills are undoubtedly excellent. His doubles game is his forte, with unique skills. His partner, Turk, is a top-class British tennis player. Their cooperation is outstanding. The Japanese general, Tawarazumi, did not participate. Yongsong and Okashi, who played, are not all-rounders. Comparing the two sides, the difference in strength is too great. After the start of the match, the strengths and weaknesses were immediately apparent. England won two sets and two games in a row (a total of fourteen games), like a fleeting dream. The winners, the losers, and the spectators all had a inexplicable feeling. In fact, the difference in skill was too great.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Change Tactics: In the third game of the third set, the Japanese suddenly changed their tactics, using high lobs to avoid the opponent's fierce volleys. This was effective, and they quickly won a game. Once the record was opened, their momentum gradually increased. Although England was strong, they could not do as they pleased at this time, and the situation turned into a stalemate. The score was tied at 2-2, 3-3, and so on. The Japanese fought hard despite the unfavorable circumstances, showing great spirit. In the end, England won the third set 6-3. The entire match lasted one hour, with three sets completed.</p>
<h3>China Defeats Portugal</h3>
<p>Result: 3-0</p>
<p>Lin Baohua 6-1 Canavero</p>
<p>(China) 10-8 (Port)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 7-5 Tafolla</p>
<p>▲ Easy Start: Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai entered the field, and the spectators applauded to welcome them. Then, the veteran Canavero arrived, and they warmed up with each other. When Tafolla arrived, the bell had already rung four times, and the battle began immediately. Lin and Qiu launched a head-on attack, gaining the upper hand first. Their natural coordination was both soft and hard. They easily won the first four games. Canavero and Tafolla, the doubles masters, had not partnered for a long time, so they were inevitably rusty. Moreover, Tafolla's offensive skills were not yet fully refined, so he made many mistakes. The Portuguese only won the fifth game. Then, the next two games belonged to China again. The result of the first set was 6-1, with China winning.</p>
<p>▲ How Difficult to Resolve: Judging from the first set, China could have played with their opponents at will. Unexpectedly, the Portuguese's form gradually improved, showing signs of a return to their golden age. They soon took the lead with a score of 4-1. Lin and Qiu tried their best to rally, creating a 5-5, 6-6, 7-7, 8-8 tie. In the end, China won 10-8. In the third set, China gained the upper hand first, making rapid gains, creating a 5-2 advantage. In the blink of an eye, the Portuguese rallied, winning three points in a row, making it 5-5. Fortunately, China worked harder and finally won the third set 7-5.</p>
<h3>The National Games Will Not Be Postponed</h3>
<p>Efforts Made to Save on Expenses</p>
<p>Nanjing, December 12th: Due to the disaster relief issue, various parties have advocated postponing the National Games. However, the organizing committee stated that it would not stop any preparations and would continue to actively proceed, saying that it would strive to save on expenses during the Games. The original budget of approximately 200,000 yuan has now been reduced to 120,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Tianjin: 29 points</p>
<p>Two New Shanghai Records Created</p>
<p>In the three-day Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tianjin triangular inter-port swimming competition, Hong Kong won the championship with 40 points. The Chinese, Huang Zhenxing, accounted for 8 points, which was a great contribution. Shanghai failed due to the elimination in the 440-yard race, losing hope of winning the championship. In the final water polo match, they defeated Hong Kong 3-2, recovering 3 points, but were still one point short and relegated to second place. It was truly unfair. Tianjin participated in the inter-port competition for the first time and excelled in short distances, scoring a total of 29 points. Tomorrow night at 8 PM, a celebration banquet will be held at the French Club, inviting the three teams, officials, etc., in commemoration.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Orders All Private Primary and Secondary Schools to Start Classes Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order to all private schools in the city that have not yet started classes, or have started classes but have not yet begun teaching, to start classes immediately and not delay on any pretext. The order states that the start dates for schools at all levels are fixed and have been announced previously. Now, according to the school calendar for the 20th year of the Republic of China, the start date for primary and secondary schools has passed for more than two weeks. It has been reported that some private primary and secondary schools have not yet started classes, or have started classes but have not yet begun teaching, which is a violation of regulations and a disservice to students and is highly inappropriate. Therefore, all private primary and secondary schools in the city that have not yet started classes are hereby ordered to start classes immediately and not delay on any pretext, in order to emphasize academics. If violations are found again after investigation, the schools will be immediately shut down. This is to be followed accordingly.</p>

<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Road and City Exhibition Yesterday</h3>
<p>Distinguished Guests Delivered Passionate Speeches</p>
<p>The First China Road and City Exhibition held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday inside the newly built venue on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. In addition to Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun, who was delegated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government to attend, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi personally attended and delivered speeches. The details of yesterday's events are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Attendees The attendees included Zhang Qun, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting; Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi; Vice Minister Zhao Jinqing; Central Committee Member Chu Minyi; President of Labor University Wang Jingqi; Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yang Nianzu; Cuban Minister General Pédro y Rial; Czech Representative Fei Zheer; members of the China National Roads Construction Association; representatives from various provinces; and thousands of Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life.</p>
<p>▲ Ceremony Proceedings At 10:20 AM, the opening was announced. Chaired by Zhao Jinqing and emceed by Yang Nianzu, after the ceremony, Chairman Wang Zhengting delivered a speech, followed by Mayor Zhang, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi, Paul, representative of the American Automobile Chamber of Commerce, and Central Committee Member Chu Minyi also spoke. Finally, Cao Yunxiang delivered a response on behalf of the chairman, followed by a photo session and refreshments before the event concluded.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of Wang Zhengting's Speech Distinguished guests, the committee of this association is holding the Road and City Exhibition here today. We are honored to have the presence and guidance of important figures from the Party and the country, as well as esteemed Chinese and foreign gentlemen. This is a great honor for the China Roads Construction Association. The Roads Association has been around for ten years, since its establishment. Over these ten years, the environment has been very difficult and challenging. However, thanks to the efforts of the committee members, the attention of compatriots across the country, and the assistance of foreign friends and overseas Chinese, we have achieved something very gratifying despite the difficulties and hardships. I believe that during the Qing Dynasty, great importance was attached to railways. However, some people at the time only knew to pay attention to railways and considered roads unimportant. It must be understood that while railways are necessary, roads are also needed to support them. Otherwise, how can railways develop? The Premier considered all aspects of transportation. His plan was to build 100,000 kilometers of railways and one million kilometers of roads across the country, as well as dredge canals and establish telephone, wireless, and radio stations. These are all closely related to transportation. Because of inconvenient transportation, all undertakings are hindered. Commerce, industry, and agriculture, no matter what the undertaking, it is very difficult to develop. Therefore, the Premier paid great attention to transportation. So now, which country has the most roads, and which country's people are the happiest? All prosperous urban areas have benefited from convenient road transportation. Wherever a road passes, that place immediately prospers. We must use roads to assist railways to make the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest prosper. This is a very obvious fact. Moreover, the Northwest and Southwest provinces are currently very poor. If more roads could have been built in the past, they would not be so poor now. From all these aspects, the importance of roads can be imagined. As for construction, railway construction is not easy, but roads can be built anywhere and anytime. Moreover, road construction is much less expensive than railways, but the results are the same. In places without roads, people's lifespans are invisibly shortened. For example, in Shanghai, transportation is convenient. Because the roads are orderly and flat, one can drive a car or streetcar for dozens of miles and reach their destination in an instant. If one walks in a place without roads, or with roads that are rugged and uneven, it takes a lot of effort, and much precious time is wasted. Even if one can use a horse-drawn carriage or other vehicle, one can only travel a short distance in a day. Such is the difficulty in places without roads, and such is the convenience in places with roads. Therefore, the relationship between roads and the country and individuals is of vital interest, and this can be known from this. Our country takes the county as a unit. If every county can do its best to build roads, it is expected that the country will definitely become richer and stronger in a few days. In the future, after there are flat roads to travel around the country, it will only take a few days by car. Recently, Weihaiwei has used a mutual assistance method to build roads since it was taken over. Because the local government saw that farmers had nothing to do in winter and that afternoon work had not yet begun, it gathered many farmers, provided them with tools and materials, and told them to build roads. The people contributed labor, and the government supplied materials. Weihaiwei is now extremely convenient for transportation, and this is the effect. Therefore, the Premier believes that roads are one of the important issues for people's livelihood, so he added a line to the three elements of clothing, food, and housing, and that is what he meant. As for the closest combination between the government and the people, it is the municipal government and the county government. If the municipal and county governments are corrupt, the people will directly suffer. Road construction projects should start from the county, and then do it step by step, and China's roads will have considerable achievements. As for the meaning of today's meeting, on the one hand, it is to express respect, and on the other hand, we also want to ask all sectors to actively assist.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of the Chairman's Welcome Speech The Roads Association has been established for more than ten years. Everyone present should already have a considerable understanding of the effects of past work, so I don't need to elaborate. All undertakings rely on the support of the transportation industry, and the sole purpose of roads is to promote the development of the national transportation industry and plan the construction of the transportation industry. Because the transportation industry is to the country as blood vessels are to the human body. When blood vessels are unblocked, the body is healthy; when transportation is convenient, the country is healthy. If transportation is inconvenient, prosperous areas will be excessively prosperous, and remote areas will eventually be closed off. Various industries have no way to develop. The association has been running around and calling out for ten years, which has aroused the sympathy of the general public, but it has not yet received deep attention. The purpose of this exhibition is to make the general public aware of the importance of the transportation industry, so that the transportation industry can make great progress in the future. This year, China's floods were extremely heavy, with 17 provinces affected and 80 million people affected. From now on, clothing, food, housing, and transportation will all rely on the relief of the transportation industry. Taking food as an example, the eastern provinces of our country have a surplus of soybeans. Because of overproduction and sluggish overseas sales, they are often used as fuel in areas with inconvenient transportation. However, the victims in the Yangtze River basin are starving and have to borrow wheat from the United States, which can be said to be extremely uneconomical. If transportation is convenient, the surplus grain in the eastern provinces can be transported to the starving people, so why should we suppress it to foreigners? China is rich in products, but because of inconvenient transportation, they cannot be transported out. For example, the output of domestic coal is very large, but due to insufficient transportation facilities and weak transportation capacity, the coal used by Shanghai factories is suppressed and supplied to Japan, and manipulated by the Japanese. Furthermore, regarding railway sleepers, the Ministry of Industry once suggested using domestic products in order to promote domestic products. However, after a detailed investigation by the Ministry of Railways, it was found that purchasing foreign sleepers only cost more than two taels of silver, while using domestic products would cost three or four times as much. The reason for this is that there are too few railways built in the country, and transportation is inconvenient, so the cost of transporting them back and forth is really high. There are too many similar facts to mention, and this is a cause for concern. What is most amazing is that if we want to transport goods from Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet into the mainland, we have to use foreign transportation facilities, which is even more painful. Recently, the Russians built a railway near Xinjiang. From the perspective of transportation value, the Russians are not very cost-effective, but because of political relations, the Russians are still actively building this road. It takes dozens of days to get from Nanjing to Xinjiang, but it only takes eight days to get from Siberia to Xinjiang. If our country does not speed up the convenience of transportation in that area, Xinjiang may not belong to us. Therefore, the construction of roads has great significance in terms of economy, politics, and national defense. Sun Yat-sen's plan for 100,000 railways can be said to be far-sighted, and this association is continuing to carry out the plan in accordance with the late Premier's proposition. Furthermore, this flood was also caused by inconvenient transportation, resulting in greater losses and more deaths. In the future, the supply of food, clothing, bedding, agricultural seeds, and agricultural tools will all require a large amount of transportation, so from all perspectives, road construction is really urgent. The biggest source of disease in China today is poverty, and the root cause of poverty is that industry has not been developed. The ancients said that profits were abandoned on the ground, but they did not know how to develop them. But in my opinion, it is not that they do not know how to develop them, but that they cannot develop them because of inconvenient transportation. Even if various land advantages are developed, without convenient transportation tools to transport them out, they are equivalent to waste. Now merchants feel that the transportation capacity is insufficient every day and appeal to the transportation authorities every day. Therefore, I hope that everyone will rise up, open up roads, and build roads, because road construction is a prerequisite for industrial development and a sharp tool for industrial development. There is industry only with transportation, and this is what I dare to assert.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Zhang's Speech (This is the original manuscript issued by the Mayor) Briefly stated, today is the opening day of the Road and City Exhibition held by the National Roads Association. I am honored to be here on behalf of the Chairman of the National Government. From the perspective of us who are in charge of municipal administration, the construction of administration, in terms of material aspects, the construction of roads is the most important construction. In terms of the implementation of local autonomy, road construction is as important as the investigation of household registration, land surveying, and security. Premier Sun Yat-sen specially marked a "transportation" character besides the characters for clothing, food and housing in the Principle of People’s Livelihood, and listed them side by side with the three problems of clothing, food and housing. Moreover, in the National Construction Strategy and Industrial Plan, he first proposed the development of transportation, believing that transportation is the only tool for developing industry. The reason is that once transportation is revitalized, not only military, political, cultural and other aspects, many difficult problems can be solved, and industry can also be revitalized. Therefore, if a country wants to be rich and strong, it must concentrate its spirit and materials and make special efforts in this way. When we talk about China's construction today, we must pay special attention to this. This is from a positive point of view. From a negative point of view, take this year's flood as an example. I don’t know how many people died because of the flood, and it is even more difficult to count those who were displaced. Floods are of course irresistible, but if road transportation can be more developed than the current situation, the people will not be doomed. Now, because of the unsoundness of various modes of transportation, we cannot adopt a swift and appropriate method to rescue them from danger. This large</p>

<p>Is it an exceptionally sorrowful and painful matter? From the above, it can be seen that transportation issues, in a positive light, greatly influence national construction. However, in a negative light, they even affect the survival of our nation, truly a problem that cannot be ignored. Currently, saving China is the so-called construction of a new China, the only major policy, the only major task, is to strive to develop transportation. The scope of transportation is very broad, including river port issues, railway issues, aviation issues, and road issues. Today is the tenth anniversary of the Road Association and the opening day of the first Road and City Exhibition. Let's first talk about road issues. The functions of roads in various aspects have already been discussed, so I won't go into detail again. Regarding roads, there are distinctions between national roads, provincial roads, city roads, and county roads. National roads are built by the central government, provincial and city roads by provincial and city governments, and county roads by county governments. Only in this way can we divide the work and cooperate to achieve the goal of completion. Taking the city as an example, if urban transportation is very convenient, but transportation from the surrounding rural areas to the city is inconvenient, then urban prosperity will naturally be affected. Therefore, when it comes to road construction, the active improvement of urban transportation is essential, but improving inland transportation and building inland roads is also an urgent matter of fact. During the Qing Dynasty, Beijing was the capital, and at that time, Beijing was the center, repairing the official roads of various provinces, with the so-called "Official Horse North Road," "Official Horse West Road," and "Official Horse South Road." In addition, each province's capital to various places also had official road branches, considered main roads, while many small roads were built between villages and towns, connecting with these main roads, forming a road network. However, since the abolition of the postal station system, road maintenance has gradually stopped. Up to now, our country's road industry is still in its infancy. Fortunately, after the National Revolutionary Army completed the Northern Expedition, the central government followed the will of the Premier and worked hard on political tutelage and construction, implementing local autonomy, and stipulated that during the period of political tutelage, each autonomous unit should construct roads crisscrossing their territories, completing the resolutions of the National Assembly on industrial construction procedures, limited to the end of the 24th year of the Republic of China, that the country must increase and complete 200,000 kilometers of highways. It can be seen that the government and the people's representatives all know the importance of road administration and are working together to promote its realization. Since its establishment, the National Road Association has devoted itself to promoting the development of roads, sparing no effort. The publications it publishes are also very numerous, such as the Municipal Administration Encyclopedia, the Road Encyclopedia, and the Road Monthly, all of which are excellent reference materials for us. Its plans and contributions to China's road and municipal administration can be said to be very sophisticated and great. When constructing roads in various parts of the country, the Road Association's assistance in terms of talent and planning is also very significant. Now, it has also organized this Municipal Exhibition, the main purpose of which is to promote the development of both road and municipal aspects, and it happens to be held in this city, so this city will naturally benefit more. In addition to representing the Chairman of the National Government in extending greetings, I can also, on behalf of the municipal authorities, extend a message to the Road Association and wish you all the best in your efforts.</p>
<p>▲Kong Xiangxi's speech (excerpt) Generally speaking, the human environment changes due to needs. The roads in various parts of northern China are very wide, ranging from forty to sixty feet. The roads in southern China are very narrow because there are more dry roads in the north and more waterways in the south, so southerners mostly focus on waterways. But now the environment has changed, and current transportation is very different from the past. With cars and trains, what used to take several days now only takes a few hours. There is an ancient Chinese saying, "The King's way is vast, the King's way is smooth," meaning that the road must be wide and flat. Under the leadership of the Kuomintang, promoting local autonomy is the most important thing. There is also the Principle of People's Livelihood advocated by the Kuomintang. The Principle of People's Livelihood is the most important point of the Premier's Three Principles of the People. Building roads is also an element of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Recently, an officer returning from Jiangxi said that there are no good roads in Jiangxi, so it is very difficult to suppress bandits because without good roads, the Red bandits hide everywhere and attack the National Army. If there were many good roads in Jiangxi, transportation would be convenient, and the work of suppressing bandits would be much more convenient. In addition to roads, we must also pay attention to waterways, such as the Grand Canal, which starts from Tianjin and extends to the Jiangnan area. In the past, it was dug by hand, but recently, due to the emphasis on trains, the river channel has become silted, so there was such a big flood in northern Jiangsu this year. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to roads, we should also pay attention to waterways. Recently, the Northeast Liaoning Minsheng Factory manufactured a cargo car, which can be said to be the first self-made car in China. Although the raw materials are not entirely domestically produced, according to the latest news, the factory is now trying its best to improve manufacturing. This is also something worth our attention. Everyone knows about Henry Ford, the inventor of the car. When he started his research, many people said he was a fool, researching machines on an empty lot next to a hotel every day, and eating in the hotel as well. When the research was about to succeed, Ford asked the hotel owner if he wanted to buy shares in the car company. The hotel owner shook his head and did not agree. Later, the company prospered, and one yuan of capital yielded ten thousand yuan in profit. Therefore, the hotel owner complained to himself every day, deeply regretting that he did not buy shares in the car company before, otherwise he would also be a big tycoon. As for after the success of the car, not only did Ford personally make a fortune, but the United States also benefited from it. Therefore, I hope that everyone can develop roads with the spirit of Ford, then the results will be very promising. With the development of transportation, world harmony is also easier to achieve.

<p>▲Chu Minyi's speech (excerpt) The relationship between roads and the national livelihood has been explained in detail by Chairman Wang, Chairman Kong, and Mayor Zhang, so there is no need to repeat it. However, the inconvenience of transportation in China is a real fact. I just returned from Xinjiang three days ago. In the past, it took at least a hundred days to go to Xinjiang, and the roads were uneven, making travel very difficult. But by taking a mountain-climbing car, it only takes thirty days to reach it. However, I still have a feeling, which is that to go to a place within our own country, we have to go through a foreign country. This is very sad and heartbreaking. For example, to go to Xinjiang, we have to go through the Siberian Railway; to go to Yunnan, we have to go through Annam. Therefore, we must resolutely and actively promote road construction, and then political, economic, and other kinds of problems will have the hope of development. This is my point of view to share with everyone.</p>
<p>▲Li Yichun's account of the process of creating a car. The National Road and City Exhibition opened yesterday. More than a hundred cars of various sizes and types were displayed at the exhibition, but only one of them was made in China. However, this car is the most attention-grabbing to Chinese and foreigners. This car is a product of the Liaoning Minsheng Factory and was created by Li Yichun, the director of the Liaoning Mortar Factory. For the opening of this exhibition, Mr. Li specially transported this car to be displayed and sent Mr. Zhang Yunting to participate in the conference. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Li's own account of the process of creating the car and a description of the current situation of the factory: (1) Preliminary test: Heavy-duty trucks are very much needed at the moment. Mr. Zhang Hanqing specially allocated more than 40,000 yuan from the remaining funds of the Mortar Factory to purchase machinery, materials, and research purposes. In August of the eighteenth year, famous single-part vehicles were shipped from the United States, and the factory assembled them to complete them for preliminary testing. Later, the purchased Releigh car was disassembled, and its important parts and easily damaged parts were redesigned and remanufactured. This was the beginning of the factory's manufacturing of cars. (2) Manufacturing plan: The heavy-duty trucks that the factory originally planned to manufacture are divided into two types: (1) Type 55, with a load capacity of about two tons; (2) Type 100, with a load capacity of three tons. Type 55 is usually referred to as small and Type 100 as large. The small car is best suited for the existing roads in Chinese cities and towns. The entire body is manufactured by the factory. Except for a few single parts, such as engine rear axle electrical devices and tires, which are either more complex to manufacture or lack raw materials, it is difficult to immediately manufacture them ourselves in practice, so we temporarily entrust foreign specialized factories to manufacture them according to the drawings made by our factory. All other parts are designed and manufactured by our factory. The large car is specially designed for driving on rural and poor roads. Although the car's speed is not very high, it is very useful for loading heavy and bulky goods for long-distance transportation. The manufacturing method is the same as that of the small car, but the tires are changed to semi-soft rubber. Because air tires are not suitable for use on rural roads, if they are specially designed for use on city roads, it is of course better to install air tires. The installation of tires can be changed at will, with the goal of being suitable. It is not fixed. The first batch of manufacturing now needs to increase the weight, so it has been changed to Type 75. The estimated annual production volume is 100 Type 75s and 55 Type 100s. (3) Enthusiastic promotion: The factory's capital is purely allocated by the Northeast Frontier Defense Army Commander's Office. In February of the eighteenth year, more than 43,000 yuan was allocated from the surplus funds of the Mortar Factory to serve as the testing fee for preparing civilian goods. The foundation of the factory was laid here. In the nineteenth year, the test production was successful, and preparations were made to open the factory. Later, the factory was allocated 750,000 yuan in national currency as the capital for starting manufacturing. Commander Zhang has always spared no effort in the construction of the country and the promotion of industry. At a time when the country is in trouble and the financial resources of the eastern provinces are sometimes stretched, Mr. Hanqing is still able to do everything possible to find ways in addition to political and military affairs. (4) Minsheng Factory: The Mortar Factory is purely a machine for manufacturing weapons and had no plans to create commercial goods at first. Since the unification of the north and south in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China and the reduction of military equipment, there has been a trend throughout the country to strive for material construction. The Liaoning Mortar Factory then had an attached Minsheng Factory, with the aim of developing industry and supplying civilian goods, and the business of manufacturing automobiles, greenhouse materials, and various leathers. (5) Selecting personnel: The factory attaches great importance to technical talents. At the beginning of its establishment, it hired American technician Myers as an engineer. Chu talents are used, and Yichun</p>
<p>Liaoning Minsheng Factory Self-made Car</p>
<p>It was not a matter of choice. In addition to manufacturing, a small number of foreigners were hired. All other important staff members are graduates of domestic and foreign universities and specialized departments. The use of people is completely based on qualifications, experience, and ability as the standard. The factory currently has 30 staff members and 177 workers. (6) Exchange of knowledge: Many of the factory's important staff members have joined the American Society of Automotive Engineers as members, in order to exchange knowledge. Written introductions, correspondence, and discussions are especially important. Therefore, the factory's staff members can obtain information about any new inventions, new creations, and drawing designs in the American automobile manufacturing industry earlier as members, and the samples and explanations obtained are also more detailed. The factory also has considerable contact with automobile companies such as Ford, General Motors, International, and Spyk, and plans to send the factory's workers to American factories every year in the near future to practice in order to seek further education. (7) First batch of products: Since the successful production of the first domestically produced car manufactured by the factory in May of this year, we have been manufacturing large batches of products according to the model to meet social needs. As the quality of the first batch of products is closely related to the factory's reputation and credit, the factory is working hard to be cautious and strive for perfection. It is now expected that the first batch will produce 45 Type 75 heavy-duty trucks. Most of the parts for the entire car have been completed, and they can be manufactured into cars as soon as they are complete. It is expected that they will be able to meet the people of the country in two months. (8) Low price: The value of the new car manufactured by the factory has been calculated, and the result is that it is not only not higher than other vehicles of the same level, but is actually lower. This is because foreign wages are ten times higher, and the cost of transporting parts and materials is particularly low compared to the shipping costs and insurance costs of transporting the entire car. Moreover, when paying import and export tariffs, the tax rate for transporting the entire car is several times higher than that for transporting parts and materials, which includes labor costs. These are the two main reasons for the low price.</p>
<p>▲Bauer discusses the relationship between roads and automobiles. Mr. Bauer, representative of the American Automotive Industry Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying, "It is a great pleasure to be here with you today. But we must know that this Road and City Exhibition is not the starting point of road construction. Your country has already made progress in this regard. What is needed now is the connection of various roads. If we open our eyes and examine your country's road map, we can understand that if the existing lines are slightly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>extended, a complete road network can be obtained. This is also the responsibility of all gentlemen present and will rank your country among the civilized countries with good roads. The purpose of this association is not limited to this. Road builders are for the convenience of automobiles, and automobiles are machines. Therefore, the best way to repair roads is also with machines. We often say that labor is sacred, but we must also use achievement as the standard. Using machines can make labor have a better effect. What ordinary people say that the status of labor is harmed by machines is actually a specious argument. From the perspective of the workers' interests, it is better to complete the roads quickly. According to statistics from various countries, even if machines are used to build roads, three-quarters of the funds are distributed to labor. However, the effect of road repair is even greater. According to statistics, the United States has developed roads and convenient transportation. Therefore, every six cars can provide one person with work. If China uses machines to build roads and completes various lines as soon as possible, it can also achieve this goal. By then, business will prosper and the people will have more opportunities to work. Automobile sales, repairs, driving, gas stations, hostels, food stores, etc., can all be operated. Canada earns 300 million yuan annually from tourists entering the country from the United States. The great benefits of this can be seen here. China has many elegant scenery and places famous in history, which can also be emulated. Nanjing and Hangzhou can also attract foreign funds invisibly. If the points passed by the current Beijing-Hangzhou Road can be directly connected with Shanghai, the nearby residents will benefit even more. This can develop resources and promote commerce. The automobile transportation industry itself is also very important. In the United States, the annual revenue is 80 billion gold yuan, second only to the total turnover of food. If China has good road administration, it can encourage automobile transportation and reap this huge profit. Road maintenance costs can also provide people with work. From the perspective of the people's interests, it is better to complete all roads as soon as possible than to build them slowly. After the roads are completed, there are many maintenance affairs that can accommodate a large number of engineers and workers. Uruguay in South America builds a small house every mile of road to house two road repairmen. If China follows this, the staff members of the highway bureaus in various provinces will have no worries about work opportunities. Furthermore, the use of machinery to develop roads on a large scale is an element of a country's progress. Fortunately, gentlemen, please remember this. Today, various provinces in China, such as Jiangsu and Anhui, are suffering from floods. Road construction is also one of the relief methods, as it can make use of disaster victims to work and provide relief. Moreover, with convenient transportation, food transportation and population relocation are faster. If a disaster occurs again in the future, it will still be easier to deal with. The method of building national roads is also quite simple. Counting them, there are only four items: (1) It is necessary to enable people to have the ability to purchase and use automobiles. For example, reducing taxes can reduce the cost of purchasing them. (2) Then, as there are more automobiles, the registration fees and gasoline donations can compensate for the government's tax reductions. (3) Then, the revenue from this tax must be independent and used exclusively for highway loan interest and fundraising. Fourth, private construction companies should be allowed to bid to build roads and municipal construction projects planned by the government. China today already has the best road engineers. If these can be implemented, new tools can be obtained to complete the transportation of this great country." Shanghai, September 12, 1931.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Convenes First Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>Resolutions on important cases such as Guangdong affairs, flood disaster, and anti-Japanese movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters convened the first municipal propaganda meeting of this session yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m., attended by propaganda committee members from various districts of the city. Wu Xiu chaired the meeting. After the meeting began with formalities, the chairman first reported, followed by reports from the propaganda committee members of various districts on the recent work status. Then, the proposed motions were discussed: (A) The national flood disaster is serious, with many victims and a wide disaster area. How should we awaken the city's people to enthusiastically raise funds for emergency relief to provide assistance? Resolutions: (1) Each district should organize disaster relief propaganda teams to give speeches. (2) Periodicals in each district should publish as much information as possible about the tragic situation in the disaster area and commend individuals or organizations who are enthusiastic about disaster relief. (3) A request should be submitted to the Municipal Executive Committee to strictly order all party members in the city to tighten their belts and work hard to assist in disaster relief as an example. (B) In the autumn of national crisis and disaster, Guangdong actually dared to take risks, advocating rebellion and claiming military power, and recently sent troops to the border of Hunan, willing to be the head of the rebels. How should we respond to this serious situation? Resolutions: (1) In the name of this meeting, send a telegram to the Guangdong authorities to give a final warning. (2) Send a telegram to all provinces in the country, explaining the sinister intentions of Guangdong's dispatch of troops to invade Hunan. If peace cannot be achieved, we should fight and ask for a united advocacy to uphold justice. (3) Request the central government to stop Guangdong's military actions. If they do not realize their mistakes, they should be ordered to suppress them to punish the ringleaders and save the country from disaster. (C) Celebrating National Day. Resolution: Follow the orders of the central government and persuade various organizations, schools, and all citizens of this city to transfer the expenses of banquets, entertainment, and lanterns during the celebration to disaster relief funds. Temporary motion: The work of the Anti-Japanese Association has seemed to decline recently. It is proposed to submit a request to the Municipal Executive Committee for strict supervision to encourage public morale. Resolution: Passed. After the discussion, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>City Boy Scouts Donated Along the Way Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opening the Box Today</p>
<p>The citywide donation organized by the Shanghai City Boy Scout Flood Disaster Relief Committee was held yesterday. The following is a summary of the donation situation:</p>
<p>▲Police Misunderstanding: All Boy Scout troops started donating in their designated areas from 6:00 a.m. yesterday. The Chinese and Western people along the way were moved by the young children who worked tirelessly to beg for disaster relief and were willing to donate generously. Unexpectedly, in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong areas, due to improper procedures, the police interfered. For example, one or two donation boxes and symbols of the Boy Scouts of Shanghai Middle School were taken away by the police. As a result, the donation teams in the Chinese area reported to the donation and relief association that the police were interfering. After receiving the report, the vice captains of the donation, Wang Gang and Leng Xueqiao, rushed to the municipal government and the emergency relief association of various provinces to request assistance. The municipal government approved the order to the municipal public security bureau to order all branches to stop interfering at 12:00 noon. Although the original state was restored once, it was eventually blocked by the police after 3:00 p.m. Due to this small misunderstanding, the donation results were slightly affected. This is truly unfortunate for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲City Games Influence: The Girls' Physical Education School, which has Boy Scouts in this city, originally wanted to participate in the donation in full, but due to the city games competition and service, more than 400 people participated, resulting in a reduction in donation power. This is truly another misfortune for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲Organize a Special Donation Team: In view of the above unfortunate situation, the association was deeply concerned that the donation amount would not be large, so it organized a special donation team, which was led by the 50th, 65th, 121st, and 270th troops, and Boy Scout service members. The time was extended to 2:00 a.m. It is hoped that with the addition of this new force, the results will be considerable.</p>
<p>▲Indian Police Assist in Donation: A respectable Indian patrolman No. 181 stationed at the intersection of Dama Road and Henan Road saw the donation situation and took one yuan in foreign currency and put it into the Boy Scout donation box. His heart of generosity is truly admirable.</p>
<p>▲Boys and Girls Commendable: A seven-year-old girl in a mansion on Chongqing Road specially took out more than 200 copper coins she had saved when she saw the donation and put them into the donation box. There was also a barefoot boy, about twelve years old. When Wang Gang, the deputy commander of the donation team, was patrolling to the New World Palace Grand Theater, he suddenly asked Wang, "Sir, what are you doing today?" Wang immediately told him that the city's Boy Scouts were raising funds for the flood disaster in various provinces. The boy replied, "I have a dime of silver, and I would like to use it as a relief fund. I wonder if I can be accepted?" Wang saw that he was young and ambitious, so he granted his request and ordered him to put it into a Boy Scout donation box. The above two children, only about ten years old, were willing to give generously. Although the amount is small, it is truly commendable.</p>
<p>▲Old Man Promotes and Assists in Donation: An elderly man, because he had no money to donate, shouted loudly to help the Boy Scouts promote. His enthusiasm for doing good deeds is truly admirable and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>▲Opening the Box in Public Today: The donation committee has scheduled to hand in the donations at the Moore Memorial Church on Sanma Road at 9:00 a.m. today. Please ask representatives from various agencies to open the box. It is reported that Mayor Zhang Yuejun has sent Mr. Wu Bilai to attend the meeting to supervise.</p>

<p>▲Date: October 25th</p>
<p>The members of the flood disaster relief associations of various provinces, Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. at Yiyuan to entertain people from all walks of life. On the spot, it was resolved to issue 100,000 charitable champagne tickets. More than 50,000 tickets were recognized by the initiators on the spot. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Attendees: Yesterday's attendees included Zhang Qun, Wang Xiaolai, Zheng Yuxiu, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Mu Ouchu, Wu Yunzhai, Wen Lanting, Wang Yiting, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, Li Zushen, Huang Boqiao, Yu Hongjun, Xu Yongzuo, Chu Minyi, and hundreds of others.</p>
<p>▲Tea Party Situation: Mayor Zhang, the chairman, first reported, saying, "This flood has spread to sixteen provinces, with tens of millions of victims. All walks of life in Shanghai have tried their best to help. However, only more than 700,000 yuan has been raised so far, which is far from enough for distribution. Therefore, the women's community has prepared tea parties and dances, and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng have also planned to issue champagne tickets. Mr. Zhang will report on the various measures."</p>
<p>▲Mr. Zhang's Report: Zhang Xiaolin then reported, saying, "The issuance of champagne tickets totals 100,000 tickets. The first prize is 448,000 yuan, and the second prize is 128,000 yuan. Based on the previous champagne issuance results, they can be sold out immediately. I hope that everyone present will advocate for them and sell at least 100 tickets per person." Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou then expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>▲Si Berlin Discusses: Si Berlin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Yiyuan, Director of the China Foreign Relief Association, and Member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, expressed his opinion, saying, "I also sympathize with the disaster relief. I agree with the champagne matter, but the income is limited, so it is necessary to expand the scale and raise funds urgently. I have a plan that can raise 10 million to 20 million yuan in relief funds, which can be drafted in one or two weeks. I will ask everyone to discuss it at that time and ask for your assistance." Zheng Yuxiu then expressed his opinion. It was then proposed to show a flood disaster film, but since the equipment was not brought, Li Zushen, who went to Hankou for disaster relief, reported on the disaster situation, etc. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>▲Champagne Measures: It was decided to issue 100,000 champagne tickets. One first prize of 448,000 yuan, one second prize of 128,000 yuan, one third prize of 64,000 yuan, and other small prizes totaling 160,000 yuan. The champagne race will be held on October 25th. Each ticket is 10 yuan, totaling 1 million yuan. After deducting the prizes, there will be more than 200,000 yuan left, which will all be used for disaster relief funds. All expenses, etc., will be borne by the China Jockey Club. When claiming the prize, tickets are recognized, not people. The prize money can be collected from the bank with the ticket without any discount.</p>
<p>▲On-site Recognition: Yesterday, more than 50,000 tickets were recognized on the spot. The remaining 40,000 tickets are expected to be sold out immediately when they are issued. It has been decided that Shen Bao, News, Times, Current Affairs News, Minguo Daily, and Continental News will distribute and sell them on behalf of the six newspapers. The tickets will be printed and issued within ten days.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Authorities to Transfer Kidnapping Ring Leader Liang Faxiu from Tianjin</h3>
<p>Shuai Zhongping, the bandit who kidnapped Lu Shaotang, was arrested in Beiping and transferred to Shanghai. After interrogation by the Special District Court, he was sentenced to death. Shuai refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. It is now learned that the leader of the kidnapping gang, Liang Faxiu, is hiding in the Tianjin Second Special District. He is also a former Qing official, rumored to have held military positions such as commander. The local public security bureau dispatched armed detectives to arrest Liang the day before yesterday. During interrogation at the public security bureau, he confessed to making a living solely by kidnapping, having kidnapped wealthy individuals more than 40 times, with ransoms exceeding 100,000 yuan each time. He purchased more than a dozen properties in Shanghai to hide the kidnapped individuals and over a hundred cars for kidnapping purposes. He also has many followers. Currently detained at the Public Security Bureau, the Public Concession Police Department has investigated and reported the case to the Special District Court, preparing a document to send detectives to Tianjin to bring him back to Shanghai for trial.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Jingwei Silk Weaving Company Involves Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Management Disagrees with Arbitration Decision,</p>
<p>Files Lawsuit Seeking Annulment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jingwei Silk Weaving Company on Baoding Road, Hongkou, employs many workers but rarely experiences labor unrest. On April 21st of this year, after discovering that 19 bolts of silk produced were defective, resulting in inferior quality, the company dismissed the workers responsible. Other workers expressed support for those dismissed and took leave on the 26th. The factory, considering this disruptive, dismissed several more workers. As a result, ten workers dismissed in two rounds, including Xu Xilin, Yu Aye, Shen Feitang, Wang Zhongrui, Qian Zhangnan, Song Qiwen, Shi Agen, He Alin, He Ashi, and Pan Yingzhou, jointly petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, which failed. The labor representatives then petitioned the Municipal Government for arbitration. Approved by the Municipal Government, Guo 　, Tao Baichuan, Pang Shurong, Zhang Yaoming, and Ma Jiliang were appointed to form an arbitration committee, with Guo as the chairman. They summoned both labor and management for questioning. According to the management, the workers' poor performance violated factory rules and their leave and coercion disrupted order, justifying the dismissal. However, the labor representatives claimed that the defective silk was not produced by the dismissed workers and that there was no disruptive behavior. After discussion between Chairman Guo and all members of the committee, it was concluded that the reasons stated by the management were insufficient, and the facts presented could not be definitively proven, indicating a failure to comply with labor laws in the dismissal of the workers, which was deemed inappropriate. The decision was that Xu Xilin and the other nine workers should be reinstated. After receiving the decision, the management, through their representative lawyer Hong Shanghao, filed a petition with the First Special District District Court based on existing labor laws, seeking to annul the arbitration committee's decision. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi held a hearing. Many of the workers' representatives were absent. Lawyer Hong stated the reasons why the management could not comply with the arbitration decision. Judge Guo, believing that a peaceful resolution was best for the case, advised both parties to go outside and negotiate. Labor disputes have occurred frequently in recent years, and most have been resolved through mediation. This is the first time a case has gone to court.</p>
<h3>Higher Second Branch Yesterday Burned Reactionary Books</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, from January to June of this year, has accumulated a large number of reactionary books, newspapers, leaflets, and other publications confiscated as a result of reactionary cases it has handled. With the approval of the Ministry of Justice, Director Xu of the court and Chief Prosecutor Wang ordered them to be burned publicly. Yesterday afternoon, the court selected an open space in the Bao'antang, south of the court, as the burning site, ordering public servants to transport the publications and dispatching court police to maintain order. Several prosecutors also attended the site for supervision. At around 3:00 PM, with all procedures completed, the fire was started, and each item was identified and thrown into the flames. By dusk, all items had been reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>Russian Teenager Commits Suicide in Fukushima Garden</h3>
<p>Building number 114, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, is the residence of Fukushima, the Japanese general manager of Mitsui &amp; Co. on Sichuan Road. For security, Fukushima hired two Indian watchmen. Yesterday morning, at around 6:00 AM, before the two Indian watchmen had gotten up, they suddenly heard two gunshots from the garden behind the residence. The two watchmen were immediately startled and followed the sound to the side of the driveway in the garden. They found a young Russian man lying on the ground, groaning, with a gun in his right hand. There was a clear trail of blood on the left side of his chest. The two watchmen were terrified and immediately ran to inform their employer, Fukushima, who telephoned the police station. The police chief ordered detectives to investigate. It was determined to be a suicide, and the man was immediately taken to the nearby Guangci Hospital. Due to the critical nature of the injuries, he was unconscious upon arrival at the hospital. It was reported that the Russian man's name was Hodireff, 25 years old, and he was currently working as a bodyguard for the Hong family at number 17 Julai Road. The reason for his sudden suicide is suspected to be due to special circumstances.</p>
<p>It is said that the Russian man was previously an officer in the military. Recently, his wife had found another lover and secretly took their two-year-old daughter with her, disappearing without a trace, leading to his despair and suicide. It is also reported that before taking his own life, he wrote a letter to the director of a certain Russian club, explaining his indignation.</p>
<h3>World Famous Swimmer Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Madegan</p>
<p>Mr. Madegan, the world-famous swimmer, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from a local foreign newspaper visited him at his residence and inquired about his experiences in detail. According to Mr. Madegan, he has been making a living from this for 34 years. His father was a renowned athlete. When Madegan was young, his father would throw him into the river and guide him with an oar, teaching him swimming. In 1897, with the help of a friend, he became a high-diving swimmer at the New York Park Amusement Association. Since then, he has traveled to various countries, earning many accolades. Many great men from various countries have appreciated his skills. He once wanted to retire to enjoy his remaining years, but his wife said that with his strength, he could still work for ten years. But in ten years, he would be a 67-year-old man. If he could still swim in a pool, he would be very lucky. It would be impossible for him to jump from a 105-foot-high ladder into a bucket of water only five feet deep. When he first learned this skill, he jumped from a height of 65 feet into a bucket of water nine feet deep, which he already found remarkable. He never expected to achieve a height of 105 feet with a bucket of water only five feet deep. The amount of water in the bucket cannot be reduced any further because the force of jumping from a 105-foot ladder into the water is at least four and a half feet. Only five inches of water are left to ensure safety. If his eyesight is not accurate when jumping, or if something goes wrong, he will not clear the bucket, and if he hits the bottom of the bucket, his body will be shattered. It is said that his visit to China this time coincides with the Chinese flood disaster, so he is very willing to perform his skills once for free, with the proceeds going to flood relief.</p>
<h3>Zhonghua Book Company's 20th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Celebration Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Book Company has been established for 20 years. The staff of the company held a celebration meeting at the general factory on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon starting at 2:00 PM. More than 4,000 male and female guests attended.

<h3>Nameless Woman on the Xinning Steamer Jumps into the Sea</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Investigates Family Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from the Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau, Huang Yinsheng, a comprador of the Taikoo Yanghang Xinning steamer, reported to the bureau on August 24th of this year that when the ship arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai today, the steward serving the guests discovered during inspection that a Chinese female passenger in the first-class cabin was missing. A letter was found in the female passenger's cabin, which was the suicide note of the female passenger (anonymous). Upon examining the meaning of the suicide note, it was learned that the female passenger had committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The items were handed over to the British Consulate in Qingdao for forwarding. The Third Branch of this Bureau also reported the same situation. While the investigation was underway, the comprador submitted a telegram from Pan Peiqing of the Shanghai Cangzhou Hotel asking whether Xu Sichao in cabin number ten had arrived safely in Qingdao and requesting a telegram in reply. This Bureau immediately sent a quick mail to Pan Peiqing with the details of the incident, a copy of the deceased's suicide note, and a list of the items, instructing him to reply quickly to clarify the truth. Now, the Municipal Post Office has returned the original letter sent by this Bureau to Pan Peiqing with the endorsement 'Addressee has left, undeliverable.' Although the deceased's name has been identified, her place of origin, address, whether she has family members or relatives, and the reasons for her suicide remain unclear. In addition to recording the case and reporting it to the Qingdao Municipal Government for record, we are sending a copy of the deceased's suicide note and a list of items to your bureau, hoping you will investigate and verify. Therefore, since the nameless woman who jumped into the sea has no address, it is impossible to find and notify her family members. We are specially requesting your newspaper to publish this in the news column so that her family members will be informed to go to Qingdao to claim the belongings."</p>

<h3>Pudong Native Association Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>The Pudong Shanghai Native Association held its fourth preparatory meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant the night before last (the 11th). All members of the preparatory committee attended, including Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Lu Yuequan, Ye Hancheng, Yang Qingyuan, Pan Hongding, Jiang Zhuoxue, Lu Wenshao, Pan Zhiwen, and Zhang Bochu. The meeting discussed the location of the general meeting and other ongoing matters. It was followed by a report on a letter from Huang Boqiao, director of the Public Works Bureau, discussing the problem of repairing the seawall. The letter stated in detail that the seawall was collapsing, posing an imminent danger, and that it was urgent to gather everyone to discuss and rush repairs, and to use disaster victims for work relief. Those present were shocked by the imminent danger and unanimously decided to appoint Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, and Yang Qingyuan as representatives to meet with the Public Works Bureau on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss repair measures. (It has now been decided that the association will convene all members of the preparatory committee at the Atlantic Restaurant again at 7:00 PM on the 14th for an emergency meeting to form a seawall construction committee to handle the matter. Huang Boqiao and Shen Junyi, the two directors, will also be invited to attend the meeting.) Finally, Pan Hongding reported on the enthusiastic situation of the fundraising team.

<h3>Xiexing Pharmaceutical Factory Benefits Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Distributing Shengdan at Reception Centers</p>
<p>The local Xiexing Pharmaceutical Factory is enthusiastic about charity. Previously, in view of the major floods in various parts of the country, when Mr. Xiang Songmao of the Flood Relief Association raised medicines for distribution to the disaster areas, the factory donated a box of Shengdan, totaling 12,000 packets. This was previously reported in the newspapers. Subsequently, the New Medicine Industry Association initiated a campaign from September 1st to 5th to donate 10% of the proceeds from sales in the retail departments to flood relief. At that time, Xiexing Pharmaceutical Factory, because its products such as Bailingji, Shengdan, Jiufu Milk White Cod Liver Oil, and Buliduo were mainly distributed through pharmacies and rarely sold retail, specially donated 200 yuan to help with flood relief. Recently, it was reported that many disaster victims arriving in Shanghai were suffering from illnesses due to unsuitable living and eating conditions. The factory specially sent people to carry the Shengdan it produces to Hunan Guild Hall, Qu Zhenren Temple, Chao Huishan Village Wanggong Temple, Chaozhou Guild Hall, Fire God Temple and other places for inspection and donation, totaling several thousand packets. The disaster victims were overjoyed by this, thinking that the packets they received would bring them new life. The distributors wanted to express the great efficacy of the medicine, meaning to bring the dead back to life. The disaster victims, seeing this empathy, felt a renewed sense of vitality and received a lot of comfort and hope. The local pharmaceutical industry urgently provides public health medicines and distributes them separately to help make up for the lack of equipment in public institutions and relief organizations. This will prevent many unexpected diseases among the disaster victims, which is also an essential plan for relief.</p>

<p>Lu Jiameng's Life Ends</p>
<p>Lu Jiameng, 23 years old, from Yangzhou, the owner of the Liangxinyuan stove shop in Shenjiawan, Wusong Road, Zhabei, used to be a groom. The day before yesterday, he had a dispute over money with Du Wenshan, 18 years old, from Rugao, a coachman at the Shunda Carriage Company across from Laian Lane on Xinmin Road. They fought each other. Du, being weaker, kicked wildly, causing Lu to be kicked in the kidney. Lu immediately clutched his testicles and cried for help. His family took him to Lu's mistress's house at No. 233 Feilun Road, where he died at 8:00 PM that night. His family reported the incident to the Second Branch of the Fifth District, and Du was arrested. Yesterday, the local police chief, Yan Liugen, and the local court were ordered to report the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Pirate Zheng Ming Executed by Firing Squad in Changshu</h3>
<p>A Cheapened Prison Sentence</p>
<p>Zheng Ming, a famous pirate from Changshu, repeatedly committed serious crimes of kidnapping, extortion, murder, and arson in his hometown. He fled to Shanghai, where he committed robbery and was arrested by the police and handed over to the Special District Court. After the Changshu County Government learned of this, it sent a letter to the Special District Court, approving his extradition to Changshu for trial. If Zheng's crime did not warrant the death penalty, he would still have to be sent back to serve his prison sentence. It is now learned that after Zheng was brought to Changshu, he confessed clearly during interrogation and was sentenced to death. After reporting to the superior for approval, he was executed by firing squad the day before yesterday. The Special District Court has already been officially notified for record.</p>
<h3>Car Crashes into Rickshaw on Zhongxing Road</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller and Passenger Injured</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, at the Nanlu Fanzili intersection on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, a Huashang Public Bus Company bus with license plate Hua Zhao 4543 and Concession license plate 17905, traveling from Baoshan Road to Zhenru, collided with a rickshaw with Public Works Bureau license plate 1922, pulled by Su Jinlou from Yancheng, coming from the opposite direction. Unable to avoid each other, the rickshaw was overturned. The rickshaw passenger, Zhou Zuzhang from Jiangwan, was on his way to report his grandson's death to his son, who was studying at a university. He was unfortunately injured in the head, bleeding profusely. The rickshaw puller also suffered injuries to his waist, abdomen, arms, and legs. The patrolman Li Qingyin and others from the Zhongxing Road police station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau reported the incident to patrol leaders Chen Ruichun and Cheng Jun, who went to arrest the bus driver Cui Jinsheng and sent the injured Zhou Zuzhang and Su Jinlou to the Fourth District. District Chief Zhou immediately ordered police officer Gao Xinyi to transfer the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment, where they were bandaged and returned. It is reported that the injuries were not serious. However, the rickshaw was completely crushed and was also sent to the district office for disposal.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Discovered in Hotel</h3>
<p>Wu Ma Lures Cousin</p>
<p>Detectives Arrest Police Officer</p>
<p>Xu Zhaoying from Nanjing used to run a beef shop in the capital. His wife, Li, 20 years old, is beautiful. Her cousin, Wu Ma, 33 years old, from Pudong, runs a teahouse in Lan Nidou, Pudong. Although Ma is middle-aged, she is exceptionally flirtatious and used to be a matchmaker. She is indeed a busybody. On the 8th of this month, she went to Beijing to visit the Xu family. Xu treated her with great courtesy due to their family relationship. However, seeing that Li was young and beautiful, Ma had impure thoughts and persuaded Li to go to Shanghai, saying how prosperous it was and that she could guide her there, making her forget to return. Li was bewitched and excited to travel. She asked Ma to accompany her to Shanghai. Ma agreed readily, and they came to Shanghai on the 10th. After arriving, Wu Ma took Li to a room in the Central Hotel outside Xiaochemen, Nanshi, for temporary lodging. Soon, Ma went out on the pretext of something. Before long, she suddenly came back with a police officer Hu from the Third District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon entering the room and seeing Li, Hu smiled brightly, approached and sat on Li's bed, chatting with her. Because Li knew that Hu was acquainted with Ma, she simply gave polite replies. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly made various indecent gestures. Li realized that something was wrong and intended to resist, fearing that she would be treated harshly. She was immediately terrified and ran out of the room, begging the hotel waiter to drive Hu away. However, the waiter refused firmly. In desperation, Li kowtowed to the waiter repeatedly, begging him to help. The waiter, seeing her pitiful state, went into the room to inquire. At that time, all the guests in the hotel had heard the noise and gathered to watch. Coincidentally, Dong Mingde, the leader of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and others were going to the hotel to inspect the rooms. Upon learning of the situation, they took everyone back for questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery at the Guandi Temple</h3>
<p>Nothing Gained ·· One Thief Arrested</p>
<p>At the Shengxian Temple Guandi Temple located at 1460 (now changed to 86 and a half) Avenue Edward VII, last night around ten o'clock, the temple was performing a sutra recitation and repentance ceremony for the Du family when suddenly seven robbers arrived. Two robbers were on guard outside the door, and five robbers rushed in, brandishing pistols and warning everyone to remain silent. Three robbers went straight into the accounting room, first cutting the telephone line, and then proceeded to search for valuables. However, apart from old monk robes, monk hats, and some scriptures, there was nothing of value. While the robbers were feeling extremely frustrated, the temple's incense keeper, Zhang Arong, seized the opportunity to climb to the roof and shout for help. Coincidentally, a Vietnamese police officer was patrolling at the intersection of Danshui Road and heard the call, responding with a police whistle. As a result, nearby detectives all rushed to the scene. The pursuit resulted in the capture of a robber near the Du residence on Huagnie Road, and a loaded pistol was seized from his hand. He was taken to the police station for interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Workers' Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding Full Reinstatement</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Will Mediate</p>
<p>Following the resumption of the strike by British public bus workers, the company refused unconditional reinstatement, leading to an impasse. Yesterday, the company continued to operate with ticket inspectors and new employees filling the ticket sales positions, barely managing to run routes 2, 5, 9, and 10. The routes were shortened, and buses returned to the depot early. A uniform fare was charged. After a split within the strike committee, all the workers petitioned the authorities yesterday. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Collective Petition Over one hundred and fifty British public bus striking ticket sellers, including Hong Mingdao, Wu Weixin, Qin Shenchong, Xu Mingfei, etc., all wearing yellow uniforms, went to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on Zhonghua Road at one o'clock in the afternoon yesterday to petition for (1) the reinstatement of all ticket sellers, and (2) the company's acceptance of the ten conditions for improved treatment proposed by the workers. The bureau chief, Pan Gongzhan, dispatched a staff member of the Third Section, Bing, to explain the situation to all the workers and accept their demands, promising to find a way to mediate. During the explanation, some workers, feeling oppressed by imperialism, which led to the prolongation of the strike, tearfully pleaded for immediate assistance for the sake of their livelihoods.</p>
<p>▲ Mediation in Progress After the ticket sellers went on strike on August 20 to demand improved treatment, the strike committee sent representatives to the company repeatedly for negotiations, but they were rejected each time. As a result, on August 31, they unconditionally resumed work. However, the company reduced the wages of the reinstated workers to 20 yuan uniformly and fired a large number of workers, forcing them to resume the strike on the 2nd. To this day, the issue remains unresolved, and the workers' livelihoods are unsustainable. In light of this, the Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the workers' petition yesterday, will consult with the Municipal Party Headquarters to discuss solutions and send representatives to mediate with the company.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Zhonghua Book Company</h3>
<p>Management Refuses to Attend Negotiations</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Still Orders Consultation</p>
<p>Regarding the labor dispute at the Zhonghua Book Company, the Social Affairs Bureau had previously ordered both parties to consult first. If they could not reach an agreement, they would then submit it to the bureau for mediation. The management recently submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, asking it to retract its order and refusing to attend negotiations. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered that mediation be carried out according to law, with no need for excessive concern. The order is recorded below: "The petition is noted. After investigation, regarding the labor dispute at the book company, the requests have been repeatedly reviewed and filed. Regarding the doubts about the organization of the union branch in the publishing industry, the Municipal Party Headquarters has replied by letter, which has also been used as the basis for notification. It is not appropriate to allow workers to act freely. As for the conditions proposed by the union, no matter how extravagant they may be, they must be mediated by the Labor-Management Mediation Committee. The result should still be based on mutual agreement. There is no need for excessive concern. You must still comply with the previous order and submit the names of the representatives for handling in accordance with the law. Do not delay further, lest disputes arise. This is the order."</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Inquiry from Mr. Lin Disheng</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I lost the opportunity to study from a young age. At the age of fourteen, I entered the business world as an apprentice. After years of hard work, I was fortunate enough to obtain a higher position. However, my current knowledge of Chinese language is insufficient for my job. I once heard people say that the only way to improve one's command of Chinese is to read and see a lot. I have followed this advice for several years, reading no less than a hundred books, but the results have been limited. Therefore, I cannot help but doubt the claim that simply reading a lot can improve one's knowledge of Chinese. I respectfully request your guidance on the following two points: (1) Which books did you read when you were studying Chinese, and which books helped you improve your writing skills? (2) What must I do to make significant progress in Chinese?</p>
<p>(Reply) Chinese language has two aspects: (1) thought. Reading more books, reading more newspapers, and observing world events and all human affairs, accumulating rich knowledge, will naturally make your writing respectable, with a clear and correct purpose. This is what is meant by "writing to convey the Dao." (2) Art. Having thoughts requires the ability to express them, which can be divided into two levels: (1) practical writing, which focuses on meeting the needs of the reader by providing what they need. (2) Beautiful writing. It is not easy to say what is beautiful, but a common standard can be stated: it moves the reader. The higher the degree of emotion, the more beautiful. The wider the scope of emotion, the more beautiful. The longer the duration of emotion, the more beautiful.</p>
<p>As for which books to read to improve your Chinese, it is impossible to say.</p>
<h3>Inquiry from Mr. Wang Canyi</h3>
<p>I am a small clerk in a rice shop, barely making a living with the sweat of my brow. It is already lucky enough that I can secure my own livelihood, let alone support my parents, wear silk, and eat delicacies. In recent days, my parents have been trying to arrange a marriage for me. They have taken all the necessary steps for their son. However, I am constrained by a poor environment, and my parents are already like candles in the wind. At that time, an inexperienced and weak-willed person like me will immediately experience economic panic and may become a beggar. If I tell them this, I am afraid of hurting my parents' feelings, which is something a child should never do. If I comply, I see this yoke being placed on me, leaving me in a dilemma. I sincerely ask the reporter to provide me with a good method to cope with this situation. Please reply in the newspaper. I wish your newspaper a bright future.</p>
<p>(Reply) You are concerned about your economic situation and do not agree with your parents arranging a marriage for you so early, lest your economic situation become even more panicked in the future. Your idea is very good. Moreover, according to the age you mentioned in your letter, you are only eighteen years old, so you can delay it for a few years. You should convey this idea to your parents very sincerely and gently, repeatedly, without offending them. But you must firmly stick to your own opinion.</p>
<h3>Inquiry from Mr. Hu Liangcun</h3>
<p>Yixian County has little land and many mountains (the mountains are rich in fertile soil and can be cultivated, but the people of the county are biased in their views, emphasizing commerce and despising agriculture and industry, and do not cultivate the land, so that people from other places are now opening up wasteland and making profits). The production is not abundant, the transportation is blocked, and the people's livelihood is difficult. Men go out to do business, and women stay at home to farm and weave, which has become a custom for hundreds of years. In recent years, due to frequent troubles, commerce has been greatly affected, resulting in many unemployed people. People are floating around, wandering on divergent paths. I dare to hope that you will provide guidance on the direction to take in order to make progress.</p>
<p>(Reply) Yixian County has many mountains and little land, and agricultural production is not abundant. The customs emphasize commerce and despise agriculture and industry, causing fertile and suitable mountains to be taken over by people from other places. Since you care about your hometown, you should unite with intellectuals and loudly appeal to the elders of your hometown, advocating "sacred agriculture and industry" and correcting the class concepts that have become a custom. This seems to be a fundamental remedy.</p>
<p>In addition to farming and weaving, women in Yixian County can also engage in some home occupations, such as sewing and raising chickens. Because transportation in Yixian County is blocked, it is inconvenient to go to towns. If they learn to sew and weave cloth, they can make their own clothes, which not only saves expensive tailoring costs but also avoids the trouble of traveling long distances, which can be said to be a win-win situation. The use of eggs is very widespread in the counties of Huizhou. At the end of the year, weddings and happy events, and ordinary people's interactions with guests, all use this to treat guests. The supply cannot meet the demand and relies on other provinces, so the price is very high. If Yixian promotes chicken farming and transports the eggs to Xiuning and other places, it will definitely sell well. As for the feed for chickens, it does not necessarily require grains. It is said that there is a kind of fat insect that is best for feeding chickens. You may want to pay attention to books on chicken farming and guide the people of Yixian County with the best methods. What do you think?</p>

<h3>Treatment Conditions in the Printing Industry Resolved</h3>
<p>Two Yuan Salary Increase for All, Establishment of a Children's School</p>
<p>But the Issue of Working Hours is Submitted to Arbitration</p>
<p>The printing industry in this city had announced a shutdown due to workers proposing treatment conditions and voluntarily implementing an eight-hour workday. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered the maintenance of a nine-hour workday before resuming operations. The treatment conditions were repeatedly mediated by the bureau, and both parties were close to an agreement, but the working hours were insisted upon by each side, making it impossible to resolve. The union and the trade association had convened a general meeting to discuss the issue. The workers conceded to eight and a half hours, while the management insisted on nine hours. Yesterday was another day for mediation. The treatment conditions were signed and resolved, but the issue of working hours was declared unresolved. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Authorities Mediate The Social Affairs Bureau convened the Mediation Committee again at one o'clock in the afternoon yesterday to conduct mediation. Dai Zhongxuan and Chen Bingxi, representatives of the trade association, and Wang Xingquan and Xia Hailin, representatives of the printing workers' union, attended. The chairman was Wang Bing of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the recorder was Zhang Gongmu. Regarding the issue of working hours, the management insisted on nine hours based on the wishes of the industry, while the labor side conceded to eight and a half hours based on the wishes of all the workers. The chairman proposed a compromise of eight hours and forty-five minutes, but the management insisted on the original proposal, making it impossible to resolve. The chairman then declared the issue of working hours unresolved and submitted it to arbitration. The remaining conditions, such as increasing wages and food and lodging expenses, were signed by both parties and declared resolved.</p>

(8) Workers who have worked for more than eight months shall be given a double salary at the end of the year. Those who have worked in the store for four months shall be given half.

If the stipulated date is exceeded, wages shall not be paid.

<p>Head Office Scheduled to Reply Tomorrow</p>
<p>All dockworkers at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Pier No. 5 raised seven demands and organized a Seven Demands Committee. They issued a declaration and appointed Yu Xianting, Jiang Yinkui, Zhang Guiqing, Wu Jucai, Xia Yinxu, and five other representatives to negotiate with the head office. Because Director-General Guo Waifeng was on leave, Secretary Bao received them and promised to forward the demands to the Director-General and reply on Monday. The situation was serious. The head office reported the workers' demands to the Social Affairs Bureau and asked for impartial handling. In order to avoid major disputes, the bureau specially convened an interrogation of the labor side at one o'clock in the afternoon yesterday. At that time, Yu Xianting, the executive director of the trade union, attended and was interrogated by Zhang Tinghao, the chief of the Third Section. It is reported that the trade union decided to wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter according to the law.</p>
<h3>Employees of China General Edison Company Petitioned Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Orders Further Consultation with the Company</p>
<p>All employees of the China General Edison Company raised eight demands for improved treatment. Because Company Manager Lu Bohong delayed in replying, the public was indignant and the situation was serious. Employee representatives had declared that if anything else happened after the 15th, they would no longer be responsible. At one o'clock in the afternoon yesterday, they appointed eleven representatives, including Deng Shuping, to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, reporting that the company had no sincerity in negotiating the conditions and requesting a swift convening of mediation. Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan personally received them and ordered them to consult with the company again. If the consultation yielded no results, they should apply to the competent authorities for mediation in accordance with the law and must not cause any other problems. The representatives were satisfied and left. It is reported that the bureau will order the company to sincerely consult with the employees.</p>
<h3>Relief Organizations Should Be Supervised by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>To Prevent Fundraising Under False Pretenses</p>
<p>A joint public notice from the Municipal Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus states: "Regarding the joint public notice, we have received Municipal Government Order No. 9584, which states, 'This year's floods and inundations have caused extraordinarily severe disasters. Soliciting donations to rescue the victims is an urgent matter. However, it has been reported that there have been cases of defrauding donations under the guise of disaster relief, which is extremely hateful. After investigation, matters related to temporary relief in this city and the establishment of charitable organizations should be subject to the supervision of the Social Affairs Bureau. Any fundraising activities conducted without prior reporting and registration should be banned to prevent abuses and promote good deeds. In addition to issuing a public notice that all organizations established in this city for the purpose of raising funds for disaster relief must first report and obtain approval for registration to show seriousness, any unauthorized fundraising activities should be strictly banned, and orders should be issued accordingly. Please comply with this order and conduct strict investigations. This is the order.' Based on this, since the floods in various provinces this year, disaster relief organizations in this city have sprung up like mushrooms. In addition, various social organizations and business organizations have launched fundraising activities for disaster relief. While the majority are sincerely charitable and eager to help, it is inevitable that some are raising money under false pretenses. In the future, whether it is a disaster relief organization, a shop, or an individual, if they aim to raise funds for disaster relief, they must first report to this Social Affairs Bureau for approval and registration, and the donation books should be sent for stamping. They must also submit a separate report on income and expenditure afterwards. Those who do not comply with this order will be banned. Due to the previous order, in addition to conducting strict inspections at any time, a joint public notice is hereby issued to inform all citizens. This is the notice. September 12, 20th year of the Republic of China, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan."</p>

<h3>Record of Overseas Chinese Businessmen Returning from Honolulu</h3>
<p>A group of six overseas Chinese businessmen from Honolulu, including Lin Xiang, returned to China to visit various ports. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Lin and others are all from Guangdong and have been doing business in Honolulu for many years. Some have not returned to China for more than ten years, and some for eight or nine years. They do not know much about the current situation in their homeland, so before leaving Honolulu, they obtained letters of introduction from the Chinese Consulate to facilitate their business contacts when they return to visit industries in various ports. They also plan to visit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in Nanjing and other scenic spots in the capital before returning to Guangdong. They will return to the United States in a month. According to Mr. Lin, speaking to a reporter from the National News Agency, there are 120,000 overseas Chinese in Honolulu who are engaged in commerce and industry. The current situation is not bad, and there is a prosperous atmosphere. Six months ago, they were shrouded in the global recession, and commerce and industry were hit hard. This was not only true for overseas Chinese but also for overseas merchants from other countries, such as Italy, England, France, etc. The Chinese banks that have been established for more than ten years, Huamei and Gonghe, have a good reputation and are trusted by overseas Chinese. The trust companies, Lianhe and Honolulu, have a considerable reputation. The situation of overseas Chinese in Honolulu is more free than those residing in the United States. The government treats Chinese people the same as residents of other countries, so overseas Chinese in Honolulu can raise funds to establish any business that is needed in the local area. Mr. Lin's son, named Bei Jue, is good at Western boxing. At the age of seventeen, he engaged in friendly sparring with foreigners in Honolulu and always won. In October 1930, he participated in the International Games held on the island and competed with athletes from England, Italy, Japan, and the United States. The athletes were no match for him. The judges on the scene praised Mr. Lin's son as a prodigy. After the closing ceremony, he was awarded two gold medals and two gold watches. Mr. Lin cherishes them very much and carries them with him, telling everyone about them.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Kerosene to be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>Considerable Contact Has Been Made</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the manager of the Soviet Russian Kerosene Trust in Shanghai is currently in contact with major kerosene merchants in this port to sell kerosene, and a contract may be signed soon. There are currently two oil tankers loaded with 2.5 million gallons anchored in Vladivostok, awaiting orders to come south. It is claimed that the Trust only intends to sell 1.5 million gallons per month in China, but it is believed that this is only a vanguard to open up the market. Once it has a stable foothold, it will ship lubricating oil and other refined products in a continuous stream. However, it remains to be seen whether the kerosene market in this port will experience a temporary price war or whether the various companies can still proceed peacefully. It all depends on the nature of the underwriting. It is claimed that for the sake of competitive protection, the Russian side will allow the underwriter in Shanghai to sell kerosene and gasoline at a price that is one cent per gallon lower than that of other companies, regardless of how the market price falls. The Soviet Russian Kerosene Trust established a management office in Shanghai in August. Its manager in Shanghai, Li Banov, has repeatedly contacted oil merchants. He initially intended to find a distributor, who would be controlled by the Trust in sales, but this did not materialize. Later, he tried to persuade capitalists in this port to organize a new organization to establish their own oil pools and packing factories to exclusively sell Russian oil, but this also failed. Now, they only seek to find a wholesale buyer. Therefore, they are exclusively in contact with the Guanghua Kerosene Company. The company is the largest among the oil companies established by Chinese merchants and is the only independent oil company in central and northern China. It has its own oil pools and packing factories. Yesterday, we interviewed its director, Mr. Yu. He claimed that if a satisfactory solution can be negotiated, the company will purchase and sell Russian oil. The company can easily sell the 1.5 million gallons per month without disrupting the market or causing a price war, because at that time, it will stop purchasing American kerosene and replace it with Russian oil. After investigation, China sells about 20 million gallons per month, so 1.5 million gallons is a very small number, and there will be no dumping. The company has already purchased Russian oil in small quantities in the past few months. In the future, after the contract is signed with the Russian side, this kerosene will be transported directly from the ports of the Black Sea, covering almost half the circumference of the earth. However, due to the limited number of oil tankers on the Siberian Railway, it must be transported entirely by sea. Later, the reporter visited the manager of the Soviet Russian Trust in Shanghai, and he claimed that he had gone to Vladivostok to report on the negotiations in Shanghai and asked the person in charge to approve the contract he had signed with Guanghua.</p>

<h3>Advantages of the Shunfeng Brand New Car</h3>
<p>Since the Madi Automobile Company at No. 10 Edward Road displayed the new Shunfeng brand car the day before yesterday, people from all walks of life have been vying to visit and admire the car's engineering innovations, its stability resembling an eight-cylinder car despite being a four-cylinder car, and its four-cylinder car economy. It is said to be a rare masterpiece in the automotive field and sufficient to open a new era for four-cylinder cars. The car is priced low and has a total of eight styles. The characteristics it possesses are too numerous to mention, the most notable being its natural buoyancy, free-eating gears, easy and safe power transmission, and double-drop frame, etc. The natural buoyancy is especially a standout feature, as the vibration of a four-cylinder engine is a unique flaw that engineering experts have been unable to solve. Now that the invention of natural buoyancy has been successful, all vibrations are completely avoided. In addition to these major features, the Shunfeng brand new car also has many other advantages, such as beautiful lines, harmonious colors, and exquisite decoration and equipment. With such an inexpensive and beautiful car, its future sales success can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<h3>Viewing Jingwei and Zhimo's Happy Event</h3>
<p>Two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the 14th year of the Republic [1925], Xu Zhimo invited us to Haining to watch the tide. Those who went with us included Chen Weizhe, Hu Shih, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Jingwei, Ren Shuyong, an American female professor, and other people I can't remember. Someone asked Jingnong, "What makes you so happy?" Jingwei said, "Getting married? You have to treat us to a wedding feast." I said, "Better than getting married." Jingwei said, "Then it's having a son." Zhimo said, "Having a son is not as good as getting married; getting married is not as good as getting engaged; getting engaged is not as good as proposing; proposing is not as good as not getting proposed to." In these few words, we can find two kinds of worldviews. Jingwei's guess is the psychology of ordinary Chinese people; Zhimo's words are the attitude of a poet. The psychology of ordinary Chinese people is to ask for more fortune, longevity, and sons. Getting married is joyous; having a son is even more joyous. But the poet's view is different. Only when you lose love can you write good poetry. Goethe lost Charlotte, and The Sorrows of Young Werther occupied the hearts of young people all over the world. Zhimo knew this truth but could not follow it for life. After Xiaoman said "Yes," the muse of poetry said goodbye to Zhimo without saying goodbye. Of course, he would still write poetry, but it was not as good as before. In the eyes of people who love to read Zhimo's poetry, this is such a great loss!</p>
<h3>A Record of Two Eccentrics in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Lao Qu</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Japan, every day at sunset, two people who look like beggars can often be seen wandering near the tram station. One is about 40 years old, and the other will soon be 40 years old. The raggedness of their clothes is even worse than that of beggars. They pick up discarded items on the ground, such as cigarette butts and scraps of cloth, and put them all in their bags. Their daily diet often depends on the leftovers of wealthy families. Therefore, every mealtime, they stop near the corners of the walls of wealthy families. When they see discarded food, they rush forward to ask for it and chew it very sweetly, as if there is still an aftertaste. One of these two people is named Satake Otohiki, and the other is named Hibun-ya Kazuichi. At first glance, they would be mistaken for people from the Hindenin [leper colony], but in reality, these two people live in Hibusamachi, Tokyo. Although they are not enormously wealthy, they have tens of thousands of assets. The reason why they are like this is that they are inherently stingy and do not want to spend a penny on food and clothing. Therefore, everyone regards them as eccentric.</p>
<p>When Satake was in his twenties, he and Hibun were both tram conductors, traveling between Yokohama and Kobe. What the Japanese call a "conductor" is the person who drives the train. The two of them are stingy by nature and share the same aspirations. Not only are their clothes torn and dirty, but apart from the uniforms given by the company, they do not even have undershirts. All their wages are saved. Later, the company felt that the character of Satake and Hibun was too low and ordered them to be dismissed. From then on, the two of them lived their beggar's life and never sought employment again. Every day, they put the money they begged into the bank for savings. All their clothes and food are obtained by begging, so they can spend nothing all day long. This has been going on for twenty years.</p>
<p>It has been found that Satake owns three city houses in Tokyo and has savings of 13,000 yuan in the bank. The most peculiar thing is that he has the rights to 24 telephone lines, which he rents out to others and collects rent. Tokyo telephones are often more in demand than supply. Therefore, getting a telephone is considered very difficult. There are often people who pay 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in gold to acquire a telephone. Therefore, it is also one of their assets. It is not known how they were able to obtain the rights to these 24 telephone lines. Each telephone earns a monthly rent of 6 yuan. These 24 telephones already bring in 144 yuan each month. In total, their monthly income is over 400 yuan. After Satake receives the money, he immediately deposits it into the bank and never touches a penny of it. Hibun seems to be slightly inferior to Satake. He owns two city houses in Tokyo, has savings of over 11,000 yuan in the bank, and owns 17 telephones, bringing in over 300 yuan each month. However, Hibun still lives his beggar's life, with the same goals as Satake. Therefore, everyone in Tokyo calls them two monsters.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Fellow Gamblers to Contribute a Portion of Their Winnings to Clothing Relief</h3>
<p>— Zhizhong</p>
<p>Since the water disaster is serious, what we hear and see in Shanghai is nothing but appeals for disaster relief. It can also be seen that people are willing to share their clothing and food and have compassion. Yesterday, at a friend's house, I saw an appeal for contributing a portion of gambling taxes to clothing relief. Its language is elegant and it is a new approach in disaster relief. I am rushing to reveal it as follows:</p>
<p>Calling "pheasant" [a gambling term] and calling "Lu" [another gambling term], life is about having fun. Without clothes or rags, how can the common people survive the year? Gambling with arrows for 3,000 coins is originally a tool for seeking pleasure, but taking one-tenth of the winnings is certainly a resource for disaster relief. Having seen the great floods reaching the sky and the starving people everywhere, even if the lucky ones escape drowning, they cannot withstand the bitter cold. Seeing Zheng Xia's picture of displaced people, how can we bear to let a single person not be clothed? Imitating Bao Shu's distribution of gold, why not use the five woods [dice] as a connection? Fellow gamblers, spending their days leisurely and playing games, are certainly not making isolated bets. How can we rely on pig herders and slaves? Collecting taxes is a long-term plan, and we must rely on wealthy gamblers. There must be someone in charge of this matter. Why not take advantage of this opportunity, divide the surplus in small amounts, and gather contributions to make a fur coat? Extend compassion to our compatriots, and taking off our clothes is truly an act of kindness. Pity these survivors and call them all to come. If we extract five out of ten, we can accumulate thousands out of tens of thousands. Of course, we are only asking for a portion of the winnings. Please do not resent the request to "distribute the sprouts." Don't laugh at working for others, and we will certainly repay you. This is the appeal.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Robbery of One Word and Five Lives</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<h3>Night in a High Building</h3>
<p>— Kai</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have been restless, and looting is often heard. Small, well-off families in the countryside now have sleepless nights. Yesterday, a friend from the countryside came to Xishan and told me about a most tragic robbery case. It happened a few days ago, a little over ten miles from my home, in the area where Danyang and Wujin meet. There is a village called Maojiatang. A resident, Old Man Chen, originally from Jiangbei, moved here many years ago and became wealthy through hard work. Now he is old and his children and grandchildren surround his knees. He is content with his later years. A certain Jia in the village borrowed 10,000 tiles from Old Man Chen to build a house in early spring, and he did not return them for a long time. Old Man Chen repeatedly asked him to return them. Recently, they met in a teahouse in a nearby village, and they brought up the old matter again. Jia told Old Man Chen, "I will return 5,000 tomorrow, and the remaining 5,000, please wait until next year, okay?" Old Man Chen nodded in agreement. Unexpectedly, someone eavesdropping nearby mistakenly thought it was 5,000 silver dollars. The next night, a group of thieves broke into the house. When they saw Old Man Chen, they immediately asked him for 5,000 silver dollars. In reality, Old Man Chen's family had no cash at all. All they had were grains, which had not been sold because the market price was not good. The thieves, finding nothing, set the house on fire to vent their anger, burning to death two sons and two daughters in the house, all grandchildren of Old Man Chen. Furthermore, the eldest grandson who went out to sound the gong was killed by a gunshot. After he fell to the ground, the sound of the gong still rang, so they added several more shots. At dawn, Old Man Chen, seeing the tragic scene of his family's destruction, cried out and died. Alas, a mistake in words brought disaster to the whole family. The cause of the fire seemed to be the trickery of ghosts and gods. However, Old Man Chen was kind and weak. He always took the lead in contributing to local public welfare and good deeds. He truly did not contend with the world or bear grudges against anyone. He was not like a local tyrant. And what he encountered was so tragic. Could it be that his fate was predetermined? Living to this point, what is the meaning of heaven's justice? I say the same about Old Man Chen's affair.</p>
<h3>Song Bowls</h3>
<p>— Li Shuping</p>
<p>A friend came from Hunan and told me about the discovery of ancient Song Dynasty bowls in Hunan Province, which is quite peculiar. I am recording it with my pen to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>Hunan Province has been vigorously constructing highways in recent years. In order to fill and build roads, they have been excavating mountain walls in a certain village on the south road of Xiangtan County. A road worker, a certain Jia, was digging a mountain cave and discovered six magnetic bowls. They were about seven inches in diameter and three inches high. The outside of the bowls was covered with sticky mud. After he took them home and washed them clean, they were radiant with five colors, glittering and dazzling. The road worker placed them in his home and did not think much of it. After a long time, someone told a certain engineer of the road bureau that they were not ordinary items. The engineer knew that a certain Westerner was skilled at appreciation, so he borrowed them to take a look. The Westerner held them up one by one for inspection. Although there was no date to examine, the colors were elegant, the texture was light, and when struck, the sound was clear and far-reaching. Therefore, he determined that they were relics from the Song Dynasty, made of combined pearls and jade, which is why they could be dazzling and last for a long time without changing. He then asked how much they were worth. The road worker raised both hands together and shook them, meaning that the price was not worth mentioning. However, the Westerner mistakenly thought he was asking for ten thousand. The road worker was a local villager who was used to using cash and did not know what a check was. He left it on the table and ignored it, and handed the bowls to the Westerner to take away. When the engineer left, he told him that the check was worth ten thousand and should be carefully preserved. The road worker did not believe him and laughed, "If this paper is really worth ten thousand, please divide it equally with me." The engineer happily agreed and put the check in his pocket, saying, "I will go to Hankou to the bank to cash it for you." He then left with the Westerner. In less than a month, he indeed sent back 5,000 silver dollars. The road worker was caught off guard and suddenly became a wealthy man, and was indescribably happy. The engineer has since resigned from his position and taken the money to study in a certain country. The Westerner, who obtained these six bowls, disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Shuping says that since the Boxer Rebellion, countless treasures from our country have flowed overseas. The Royal Museum in London is mostly filled with old collections from our country. If we were to witness it, there would be no one who would not be heartbroken. These six bowls can also be said to be rare treasures and should be stored in domestic museums or exhibition halls for permanent display. How can we allow foreigners to easily take them away at a low value? The worker was certainly ignorant, but the engineer cannot escape his blame. (Remitting Rewards for Disaster Relief)</p>

<h3>Random Musings from the Di Xiang Zhai Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Zhang Hucheng and Zhou Xuexi</p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the Republic. Those in charge of government finances change every year, or even several times a year. There have always been a few wise men, but there are many who rise to high positions whose talents are not sufficient to meet the requirements. Aside from borrowing money and levying taxes, there is no other way. I admire Zhang Daishan (Hu) and Zhou Jizhi's (Xuexi) way of handling affairs, which was appropriate and measured. Both Hu and Xuexi passed the top-level imperial examinations. One became a supervisory censor, and the other became a prefect. Both had a good reputation during the late Qing Dynasty. Hu was especially rich in literary talent and quick-witted. During the years of Jia-Yin and Yi-Mao [1914-1915], Yuan Shikai held power, and his authority dominated the country. There was a view of embellishing the state. At that time, Xuexi was in charge of the Ministry of Finance, and Hu was the deputy minister also managing the Salt Administration. Xuexi held a policy of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, which was effective. As a result, the national treasury was not exhausted, and government expenses were sufficient. It was unheard of for generals to forcibly demand military funds. Even powerful figures such as Feng Guozhang and Zhang Xun rarely made unreasonable demands. Qu Yingguang even plundered vast amounts of money to aid the central government. This was certainly due to Yuan Shikai's coercion, but also to the efforts of Xuexi and Hu. After a long time, the two often disagreed on matters. Xuexi was stingy and often unreasonable, while Hu was extravagant and had a reputation for being bold and decisive. It was difficult for them to tolerate each other. Xuexi, relying on Yuan Shikai's favor, revealed Hu's shortcomings in a certain case. It was not known whether Yuan Shikai was aware of the facts. While Xuexi was consulting with him, Yuan Shikai wanted to say something, but he couldn't get the words out. He reluctantly ordered Hu to be dismissed from his position and sent far away to Sichuan. He secretly sent someone to comfort Hu, saying that Liu Yan's management of finances was unsurpassed, and Guan Zhong would eventually be reused. "The fault is with me. It is best to avoid it temporarily." Hu lingered and could not leave. Later, Hu was reinstated and Zhou Ziqi (Ziqi) took over Xuexi's post. Xuexi had already received the news and rushed to pay his respects. Ziqi was already seated. Yuan Shikai waited until Xuexi finished speaking and said angrily, "I knew what kind of person you are. Why don't you understand my interests? Those who handle big matters cannot begrudge small expenses." He looked at Ziqi and said, "Jizhi has worked hard for a long time and should rest. You can replace him. Follow Xiao He's rules, and I will be at ease." Ziqi strongly stated that he did not have the talent or ability to overcome this position. Yuan Shikai said, "Say no more. You will not be forgiven if you say more." Ziqi did not speak again. Xuexi left disappointed and immediately submitted his resignation. After several years, Hu also retired as the Grand Secretary of Finance. In the year of Jiazi [1924], he rose again as the Grand Sima. Xuexi suspected that Hu might not have forgotten the past and would seek revenge. He was uneasy. His father, Yushan (Fu), wrote a letter to Hu, accusing his son of his past mistakes. Hu read the letter and laughed, saying, "As the proverb says, it is difficult for one person to satisfy everyone. Also, 'Life is full of meetings and partings.'" He wrote back to Fu, saying, "During my term, I will not allow these matters to be exposed again." Fu often told people about it, saying, "Daishan is, after all, a scholar and his magnanimity is far-reaching."</p>

<h3>A Husband's Wife (12)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Chen and his wife's argument had failed. He refused to open his mouth and simply covered himself with the quilt and lay in bed, pretending not to hear whatever his wife said. This attitude was, of course, also a feminine attitude. When Mrs. Chen saw that he was not saying anything, she naturally stopped arguing after a while.</p>
<p>From that day on, these two couples harbored great resentment and a thick wall of separation between them. However, Lan Zhen felt sorry for Mr. Chen being oppressed by his wife, while Mr. Li approved of Mrs. Chen's straightforwardness. Mrs. Chen even went to Mr. Li's office to chat, or went to the movies, to the dance hall, or to friends' houses to play cards. Mr. Li still went home after finishing his official business as usual, but Lan Zhen often went to Mr. Chen's house to chat. What Lan Zhen talked about at first was limited to Mr. Li's absurdity and unfaithfulness. She also told Mr. Chen about waiting for her husband in the snow and seeing a woman in the car. Mr. Chen volunteered to investigate whether this woman was an ordinary prostitute, Mr. Li's mistress, or an unofficial lover. Once he had some clues, he would definitely tell Lan Zhen in detail.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen and Lan Zhen were actually both oppressed, so everyone complained. The more people complain, the easier it is for them to click and get along. They had long opportunities to talk every day, and their friendship gradually deepened. At the same time, Mr. Li and Mrs. Chen naturally became closer in the darkness of movie theaters and dance halls. Mrs. Chen did not manage many things at Mr. Chen's house because she was not often at home, so she asked Mrs. Li to help manage them. Even making the bed, folding the quilt, mending socks, and preparing the evening meals were all managed by Mr. Li. In fact, Mrs. Li was equal to Mr. Chen's wife, and Mr. Li was Mrs. Chen's husband. From the perspective of old morality, what an absurd history this was!</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen's burden was therefore increased. He felt sorry for Mrs. Li's frugality, so he often gave her some clothes or other things, at least twenty or thirty yuan or so a month.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's burden also increased. It was naturally his responsibility to play with Mrs. Chen outside every day. There was no reason to let the woman bear this expense. The more he spent, the more stingy his family became, and even the daily food expenses were not paid in full.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>▲Final Cut of Two Taels: Yesterday, the 12th, the gold bar continued its downward trend, with extreme volatility and unstoppable turbulence. Initially, it hovered around 760 taels, stabilizing at noon with a difference of seven taels. Ultimately, it fell by two taels and several qian. Market sentiment among traders remained erratic, with various firms pursuing different strategies. The silver market suddenly surged, opening lower at 57 taels. However, active buying followed, particularly due to the decline in foreign exchange rates. This led to a resurgence, exceeding 60 taels and reaching 63 taels and some change. Next month, the market will be closed on Saturdays. It is rumored that the Bombay exchange plans to reduce the rupee exchange rate from 1.6 to 1.4. If silver standard is restored, should gold prices be suppressed? However, the implementation date remains uncertain. The market conditions this week have been particularly complex, with the highest price reaching 75 taels and two qian, and the lowest at 54 taels, a difference of 21 taels and two qian. Overall, it has continued to fall by seven taels and one qian. The market conditions yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Sharp Decline at the Opening: The opening price for October delivery fell sharply by more than seven taels and four qian to 758 taels and five. This was because both silver and silver prices rose by one-eighth, and US stocks rose by slightly more than nine jiao. Subsequently, the price fluctuated between 58 and 59.5 taels. Trading activity varied. Then, due to sales by Yongfeng, Fuchang, and the Dalian Gang, the price dropped to 56 taels and eight qian. Suddenly, Hengxing, Yiyu, Shunli, and Wanxing stepped in to buy, and the British gold price initially eased and then stabilized. Zhengjin and others initially bought January 25, and December 3125. Then, Chaoxian (Korean) and Mitsui matched the current month's 1875. The gold price rose steadily, reaching 61 taels and eight qian at 9:20, with slight fluctuations of one or two taels. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. Senchang and Hengxing sold, bringing the price to 60 taels, immediately rebounding by two taels and two or three qian. Afterward, there were fluctuations of one tael or so. Various firms' transactions differed, but the volume was not large. Around 10 o'clock, Tongtaichang, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Yongfeng all sold, causing a further decline of two taels to 60 taels and 02 qian. Subsequently, Yuanmao bought without restraint, pushing the price up by three taels in just over 20 minutes to 63 taels. The British gold bank bought January 25. Suddenly, selling pressure intensified. Chengfeng, Yongfu, Yusen, Changhengxing, Tongtaichang, and others all sold, causing a plunge of six taels in just ten minutes, with only a few qian to at most one tael of rebound. At around 10:30, the price finally dropped to 57 taels, then rebounded upward, with Hengxing, Dadecheng, Senchang, and Yonghongli scrambling to buy, and the British gold price improving. January and December could be sold at 1875 to 25 matching. A surge of seven taels followed, reaching 64 taels at 11 o'clock, with fluctuations of two taels afterward. After 11:30, Yuanmao, Yongfuchang, and others sold due to the Indian report of 134 anna, causing a drop to 61 taels and eight qian. Then, because Zhengjin bought November British gold at 1875 to 25, it rose by three taels and nine qian. In an instant, it dropped slightly by one tael and five or six qian. Near the market close, it rebounded by seven or eight qian, closing at 63 taels and one qian, a decline of two taels and eight qian compared to the previous day, then rising to three and a half taels. The maximum price for half a day was 64 taels, and the minimum price was 56 taels and eight qian, a difference of seven taels and two qian.</p>
<p>▲Limited Spot Transactions: Goods opened early at 9 taels and two qian, and closed at noon at 64 taels. The listed price was 790 taels and 02 qian, with a discount of around 30 taels, and 27 taels at noon. Account registration was between 60 and 63 taels, with a water replenishment of 60 taels. Spot transactions were not quiet, but the profit margins were small. Due to insufficient goods, only the Kebang sold several hundred taels to Yingfengheng, with prices increasing by 7 taels and 75.</p>
<p>▲Active Trading: Trading on the trading floor was active, but the inflows and outflows differed. Statistics show that Dadecheng, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Yifeng, Yuanmao, and Hongli all had more inflows than outflows. Tongtaichang, Tianfengyong, Yongfeng, Yuanxingbing, Futaiheng, Bingxing, Chengfengyong, Fuchang, and Yuanheng all had more outflows. Yuantai, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Senchangyong, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, and Hengxing had frequent inflows and outflows, with large volumes. Speculative traders were less active than yesterday. The Dalian Gang had over 2,000 bars, with inflows and outflows balanced. The Guang Gang had over 1,000 bars of inflows and several hundred bars of outflows.</p>
<h3>The Spread on Large Silver Bars is Narrowing</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 12th: The spread on large silver bars is narrowing.</p>
<p>The near-term price is unchanged, while the forward price is shrinking by one-sixteenth, both at 13 pence 0625.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Seems to be Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets rebounded and stabilized. The British and American exchange rate saw a slight increase, and HSBC's listed price only saw a reduction of half a yuan in the German exchange rate, to 127.5 marks. There were no other changes. The internal market for banks was initially weak but then strengthened, stabilizing at noon. The gold market initially declined but then stabilized and ultimately broke through the 60-tael mark, still lower than the previous day. Therefore, compared to the previous day, the British exchange rate increased by 0625, the American exchange rate increased by 125, and the Japanese exchange rate fell by half a point. Trading among Chinese merchants was relatively active. Chengfengyong and Fuchang still sold over 100,000 pounds of British gold. Banks had a strong buying intention, with settlements reportedly reaching around 200,000 pounds. At noon, Bombay suddenly sold tens of thousands of pounds, and the American dollar had only around 200,000 yuan in inflows and outflows. The Japanese yen saw inflows of tens of thousands of yuan from the Dalian Gang for near-term settlement. The market seemed to be loosening. The afternoon was a weekend and there was no market.</p>
<p>▲The British exchange internal market has a spread of 125. The morning bid price was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 to 1875, and the buying price was 1875 to 25. Zhengjin initially bought January 25, and then traded with Mitsui for December 3125. HSBC bought December and January 3125. Korea sold and Mitsui bought September 1875. Mitsui bought January 25. Hwabee sold October 1875. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Zhengjin, and Mai Bank bought January. Mitsui bought December, both at 25. Anda bought November and December 1875 to 25. Zhengjin also bought at the same price. The afternoon closed flat, the same as the opening. The loosest price for forward contracts was 3125, and the tightest price was 1875, both of which were prices absorbed by the banks.</p>
<p>▲The American exchange internal market has a fluctuation of 25. The morning bid price was 30 yuan 0625 to 75, and the buying price was 75 to 875. Mitsui and Dalian mutually traded the current month at 30 yuan 075. Hwabee sold October at the same price. The afternoon closed the same as the morning.</p>
<p>▲The East exchange internal market fluctuated by half a point in the first half of the day. The morning bid price was 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen 25, and the buying price was 1 tael 6 qian 075. Taiwan sold October, and Mitsui and Korea sold September, both at 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen. Korea sold October at 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen 125. The afternoon closed with a bid price of 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen half, and a buying price of 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen.</p>
<h3>American Silver Rebounds by 125</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a telegram from New York on the 11th, stating that the American silver price also rose by 125, to 28 cents for spot.

The Bombay spot price decreased by 2 anna, to 44 rupees, and the forward price also decreased by 2 anna, to 44 rupees 01 anna.</p>
<h3>Quiet Weekend Clearance and Loan Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because it was Saturday, banks closed in the afternoon as usual, so the financial market was exceptionally quiet. The market price of foreign loan rates in the market was 7 qian 2 fen half for both the morning and afternoon, a decrease of 2 hao half from the previous day's afternoon market. The silver loan rate was 1 qian 5 fen in the morning market and 1 qian 4 fen in the afternoon market, slightly lower than the previous day by 1 to 2 fen. The listed price of banks remained at 6 fen. There were no extra surcharges for overdrafts. The value of drafts issued was 925,000 in the morning and 40,000 in banknotes.

In the auxiliary currency market, the prices of Jiangnan small foreign coins were 6 qian 6 fen 2 li for both the morning and afternoon.

Transactions amounted to 85,000 jiao in the morning and 110,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of copper coins increased by 1,000 wen to 371,500 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Debt Market Prices Weaken Again</h3>
<p>Salt Tax Unified Tax Falls by One Yuan and Sixty-Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Customs and Disarmament Rise Alone; Market Conditions Remain Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the local securities market and the various bonds in the market continued to be vibrant, and buyers and sellers were enthusiastic. The price of the bonds fell again, and all parties were very active. The current market was extremely quiet. Regarding the changes in market prices, the initial opening in the morning was when the market sold new bonds enthusiastically. For a time, the selling sentiment was strong, and the prices fell sharply. However, the demand and supply situation gradually stabilized, and the price of bonds saw peace. There were not many ups and downs in each market. The change in the price of bonds has come to an end, or perhaps only slightly. As a result, except for the customs duties and disarmament, which have remained firm and continue to rise more than before, the appropriation, reorganization, and the "19" customs duties were only small angles, while the salt tax in October fell by two yuan and one jiao and a half, and the September period and the unified tax were also one yuan and sixty-seven jiao less, and the "20" customs fell by one yuan. The rest have fallen quite a bit. It is estimated that the futures transaction was 15.7 million in the morning and 8.8 million in the afternoon, totaling 24.5 million. The current spot market was only 40 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Form of the Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market is Pretty</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, but the situation looks pretty. This is because there is a part of the short covering, which causes the market to rise. However, the situation of overseas cotton yarn is still tired, so a part of it is still sold short. Moreover, due to the severe floods everywhere, it will hinder the actual sales later. However, the manufacturers have no intention to set buy in large quantities, so the market is stable and the market is relatively fierce.</p>
<p>▲The Man-Made Standard Rises Five or Six Qian: In the Man-Made Standard market opening, the American cotton was flat and the situation was soft, and the prices fell by five or six qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the three-grade yarn rose, the popularity saw hardness, and the large households covered short positions, and each month rose by four, six, eight qian to one or two taels. The turnover totaled 17,800 packages. It was found that Yichang bought 1,000 packages, Gongtai 550 packages, Yiyu 500 packages, Tianlong 550 packages, Ruidai 1,400 packages, and Yongchang 450 packages. Dafu bought 1,000 packages, Xincheng 2,200 packages, and Xinchang 400 packages. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>January 151.8 578,052 February 151.7 538,400</p>
<p>▲Dull Spot Sales: Spot yarn sales were dull. It was found that the total number of packages bought by various gangs throughout the day was 775 packages, and 90 packages were imported by the same industry. The market was flat. The Changsha entered 65 packages among the Kebang, Ningbo entered 65 packages, Guangdong entered 40 packages, Tianjin entered 100 packages, the North Gang entered 40 packages, the Inland entered 175 packages, Shantou entered 130 packages, and miscellaneous gangs entered 125 packages.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Flat</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly flat, but the overall situation still lacks vitality. Because the cotton market is quite weak, and Japanese merchants often sell, the market is soft and ang, and the factories do not ask about the current needs. Foreign cotton is cheap, and the foreign firms specially accommodate it, but the Han gangs still have no intention of selling, and buy and do more when it falls. The future is still determined by American cotton.</p>
<p>▲The Han Standard is Slightly Stable: The Han Standard market opened flat, and then became slightly firmer in the second and third markets. Each month fell slightly by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, each month rose slightly by one or two qian. The turnover totaled 40,400 dans. It was found that Yicheng bought 2,400 dans, Yichang 2,300 dans, Xinfeng 1,200 dans, Gengfeng 1,700 dans, Houfengchang 1,000 dans, and Hengyi 1,000 dans. Changfeng bought 3,300 dans, Yichang 2,700 dans, Xincheng 1,900 dans, Shenchang 1,000 dans, and Jifeng 1,400 dans. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲The Current Transaction is Extremely Clear: The current cotton transaction is very clear. The source is estimated to be 1,334 packages of Xinyao cotton.</p>
<p>Xinyao Flower 38.40 Among the Kebang, 1,334 packages were delivered to the warehouse</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Flowers Rise and Fall Differently</h3>
<p>▲American Cotton Firms Slightly Due to Short Covering: Yesterday, American cotton was initially fatigued due to poor news from Liverpool, and then became firm due to powerful Wall Street and short covering. It is estimated that futures rose by one to three pounds, and spot rose by five pounds. British cotton futures fell by 13 points, and spot fell by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was calm and steady, and exporters from Japan and Europe sold. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 3.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 3.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 11th).</p>

<h3>American Cotton Hedging Sales Increased Slightly Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram report from New York on the 11th reports on the cotton market for a week, saying that the government's cotton production estimate on Tuesday was slightly higher than the public's expectations, but the impact was not significant. The increase in hedging sales for the whole week was very small. President Hoover's discussions with the federal banks and cotton merchants on the establishment of a private bank, credit loans, and the export of American cotton have reduced speculators' sales and aroused temporary purchases, but the price has reversed, and the supply has easily increased. Most experts firmly believe that the reduction in planting movement and other relief raw cotton events in the next season are now holding movements in the South. Although cotton harvest is still delayed, the weather is still good, and the market is quite quiet. The weather is generally wait-and-see. If the harvest progresses, hedging sales are expected to increase.</p>

<h3>The Grain and Rice Market Downstream Becomes Softer</h3>
<p>▲The sources of the various gangs on the South City West Road are still surging. Early and late rice will arrive on the 22nd and 23rd. The stock of boats in the middle of the Pujiang River is about the 30th. Due to the bad weather in the morning, there are few people from the city on the market, and the transactions are subtle. The Kebang handles 300 dans, and the market is shorter. The incoming goods from Sutongping, Li, and Houlu are also not lacking, and there is a large amount of inventory, so the situation is two feet shorter. The price of the Yanglu tip is reduced by the price of the jiao, and the needs of the Yinyuan Winery and Restaurant are still large, and the price of the restaurant is about the angle. The new japonica rice is limited, and the price is stable.</p>
<p>▲There was no activity in Xinzha yesterday, and the foot of Heshui was difficult to improve. The morning transactions in the shops were rare. Thick japonica high-quality goods fell by one jiao, and thin early two rice fluctuated limited. There are still many new japonica new tips coming in, and the price is tired by three angles. The Yanglu tip is due to this city, and the buying is extremely lacking. Foreign ports such as Yongyue 2 help all have the news of continued handling, and the boats from the Li Road are estimated to be from Changshu, Wuxi, Yixing, Jinze, Shipu, Songjiang, etc. 18.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Presents Weakness Both at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market remained uneventful, and the market continued to fall. The hoarders in this street took the opportunity to take advantage of the small fatigue and bought it slightly. Therefore, the market appeared to be tired but stable. The market was only handled by No. 1 Saigon, a street catering 500 bags, priced at 14 yuan 1 jiao. Taizhou rice continued to arrive at the port, but the conversion was still flat. However, the number of Taizhou exports was limited. After the pre-determined total amount was loaded, there may be no more coming, so the market can be stabilized. It is estimated that 350 bags were opened, priced at 13 yuan 1 jiao 2 jiao, and were handled by the real households in this street. The foreign market price of foreign rice has been reported to be small. The foreign firms all sold them yesterday. The price was about 2 qian lower than at the beginning of the week. The Thai and telegrams were equipped with 500 tons immediately, and the price was 6 taels 8 qian half. Chansen played out a telegram of 500 tons in October, priced at 6 taels 7 qian half, all of which are No. 1 Saigon.</p>
<h3>The Powder Market Falls in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market, all factories threw it away, but foreign wheat at home and abroad reported an increase of 3 or 4 jiao, and some non-industry long buyers were still bought, so in the morning, the market price still remained at the fluctuation. After the opening in the afternoon, the wheat market has been continued to be sold by the manufacturers, and most of the long-term holders are also returning in the near future, and the market has changed accordingly. Since there is no continuous current in this month, the factory setting is even more effective, and the closing price is 1 point lower than the previous day. October and November are 2.5%, December is not available, and January and February are 2.5%.</p>
<h3>The Futures Wheat Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, the transactions in each month were dull, and there were few customers entering, and most of the long-term holders wanted to block it out. The market was full of buying interest, and the trendy market in recent days turned into a tired market with a sharp turn. Most of the long-term holders and inland hoarders returned as much as possible, and the floaters took the opportunity to compete for sale, so that the price fell in each market after the opening, although the foreign wheat telegram reported an increase of 3 or 4 jiao, but the market had no impact, the closing small small 3 points in each month, the October point was small, the November point was small, December Small 4 points, January and February small 3 points each, the current wheat slightly arrived, but the factory appetite was faded, and the general market was only handled by the Huafeng factory with 200 bags of Zhenjiang wheat, priced at 3 taels 5 qian half, 500 bags of Wuxi wheat, priced at 3 taels 6 qian, and 400 bags of Yangzhou wheat, priced at 3 taels 6 qian to 3 taels 5 qian half.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Daylily Market Price Steps Up</h3>
<p>Existing Bottom is Thin</p>
<p>Daylily is now popular with Guangdong sales, and the market price is gradually rising. In the trading number, Zhuang goods are priced at 22 taels half, and the second is 20 taels half. It is found that the existing base in the market is extremely thin, and the total is less than 2,000 packages. The market is strong and has no hope of loosening. Yesterday's market, the best Zhuang Cai was sold for 28 taels to 27 taels half, and the second best was 26 taels to 21 taels.</p>
<h3>New Longan Opens at High Prices</h3>
<p>More Than Twenty Taels Worse Than the Old Goods</p>
<p>The new sun-dried longan meat arrived in a batch the day before yesterday, only five pieces in total. Because it was the first time to see new, it felt quite rare, so the opening price was very good, and it was sold immediately. This batch has a very wet identity and black petals. The opening price is up to 66 taels. The higher price has one or two taels, and it is heard that the land price must be 70 taels under the Shen regulations.</p>
<h3>The Silk Tea Foreign Firm Market Still Does Not Improve</h3>
<p>Although the factories in the United States and France had telegraphic transactions yesterday morning, the M rice price was not high, and the silk price was still high. The transaction was difficult to smooth. Yesterday, only Ganli and other companies entered 50 packages of Shanghai White Factory Jing, and Samsung and other companies entered 20 packages of Yellow Crude Silk. The price remained stable.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou New Autumn Silk Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>Cocoon Merchants Compete to Purchase High-Quality Cocoons… Prices Open at Over Seventy Yuan</p>
<p>This year's autumn silkworms in the Hangzhou area continue to be affected by unfavorable weather. During the silkworms' great sleep, transformations occurred, leading to the abandonment of forty to fifty percent. Early silkworm cocoons have already entered the market, and the Gongchen Bridge cocoon market has already begun weighing. The arrival of goods on the market is not smooth. Late silkworms are still only forming cocoons. Cocoon merchants are competing to purchase high-quality cocoons and are willing to raise prices for fresh cocoons. The initial opening price of fifty-five to sixty yuan has now risen to seventy to seventy-five yuan. The quantity of cocoons collected by each firm is still limited.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea Sales to Russia are Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai, Russian assistance associations showed great interest in Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. British firms such as Fu Shi and Bao Chang also had some demand. The market situation was not desolate. Sales prices opened at fifty-five to fifty-six taels, which was quite firm. However, for Zhenmei Dabang and other items, foreign firms are mostly waiting and seeing, as they have not received replies to telegrams sent a few days ago. The market appears slightly quiet.</p>
<h3>A Total of Over 160,000 Boxes of Luzhuang Tea Arrive</h3>
<p>Luzhuang green tea is an important commodity for foreign trade. This year's harvest in various areas has been poor, but the sales volume of stores and firms is large. The amount transported and sold to foreign firms is therefore increasingly scarce. The total amount arriving from various sources is now exhausted. A record of the total amount arriving is specially compiled below: Hong Yuan Yong: 38,146 boxes; Yong Sheng Chang: 19,826 boxes; Sheng Chang Sheng: 18,510 boxes; Gong Sheng Yong: 18,748 boxes; Yuan Feng Run: 11,619 boxes; Shen Yuan: 16,143 boxes; Yong Xing Long: 12,112 boxes; Zhong Xin Chang: 11,520 boxes; Ren De Yong: 7,568 boxes; Qian Ji: 1,499 boxes. The total arrival is 163,291 boxes, a decrease of 90,000 boxes compared to last year and a decrease of 160,000 boxes compared to the year before. The decline of China's tea foreign trade can already be seen.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Prices for Hardware Increase by 2.5 Fen</h3>
<p>The hardware market yesterday still showed no progress. The stagnation of sales to customers is the biggest reason. Therefore, the overall special situation is recorded. However, the tinplate market trended from weak to robust. The initial price was 15 taels and 2.5 fen, but yesterday it increased to 15 taels and 5 fen to 7.5 fen. Trading export firms, such as those in Tianjin, Vladivostok, and Fujian, are continuously purchasing, so there were as many as five or six hundred boxes offered. However, after the previously sluggish market in Shanghai was searched and bought, it suddenly became popular. It is said that if the factory's business picks up in the future, the market outlook will be even more promising.</p>
