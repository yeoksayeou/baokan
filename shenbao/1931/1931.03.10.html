<p>▲關於胡的病狀與其居住問題國民政府九日晨舉行總理紀念週、蔣主席報告胡漢民的病狀與其以後的居住問題、原詞如下、「各位同志、胡漢民同志因爲約法問題、與多數中央委員意見不同、稱病辭職、這件事本席於上次紀念週己經向各位報告過了、中央當時在上星期一開了一個臨時常務會議、議决准其辭職、以遂其個人之志、並推林森同志爲立法院院長、邵元冲同志爲國民政府委員兼立法院副院長、這些事情、大概各位同志、己在報上看見了、胡同志辭職後、次晨、即與邵元冲同志逕往湯山養病、這就是胡同志辭職赴湯山的經過情形、本來一個政治上的員責者、因爲政見不合引退辭職、乃是一件極普通極平常的事、用不着奇異、在政治上了軌道人民政治知識較高的國家、遇着這一類的事件發生、人民都是看做很平常、决不致大驚小怪捕風捉影、乃自胡同志辭職以後、在上星期中、竟生出了許多奇奇怪怪的謡言、甚至於說胡同志病勢沉重、温度到了一百零五度、且說一日竟暈倒了兩次、其實據衞生署劉署長當日正式診斷報告、胡同志在湯山靜餋、體温九十九度、脈搏七十二至九十、皆如常人、惟其向來有後臘神經痛病及血壓逈高之症、據醫生推此病源由來甚久、至少得之於一年以前、故亦非短期間所能痊愈、其在湯山所作的詩文、報紙上也曾經登載、前日又據劉署長報告、胡同志現在己復常態、温度脈搏、均没有異狀、但是有些人竟要把這件極平常的事、故意說得非常嚴重、而且要無中生有的、造出許多危詞聳聽的消息、駭人聽聞、這種人的心理、惟恐天下不亂實在卑劣極了、至於反動份子以及某國報紙、惟恐中國不亂、自然要借這機會、揑造事實、散布謡言、以遂其淆惑聽聞、動摇人心的隂謀、各位同志之應該要看清事實、不要輕易的爲謡言所蒙蔽、致中奸計、我們且可由此測騐我們主義的基礎穏固、因爲某國報紙造謡的利害、更覺得我們政治己上了軌道、黨員對主義的認識、與對公私是非的分明、不會如往年以個人的情感、而忘了以黨員的責任、以牽動整個的政治、此實足以使帝國主義者、爲之驚恐不安也、胡同志昨日己回到他南京的私邸了、至於胡同志今後的行動如何、今天也應該向大家報告、有一部份人似乎關心於胡同志的行動、是否自由、關於這一點、似乎應該有向各位說明的必要、照理說、革命黨員個人的行動、誰也不能自由的、就是中正個人的言行、亦無時不受中央與國府的制裁與拘束、絶無自由的餘地、總理常常說過我們所爭的自由、是國家的自由、民族的自由、不是個人的自由、如果個人要自由、則國家民族就不能得到自由、這是總理常常所詔示於我們的、這些道理、就是胡漢民同志在上一月國府紀念週中、講讀遺教時、亦曾說官吏與黨員、是没有自由的、實在是革命的精義、所以一個革命黨員、他的思想行動、都應該受黨的規律和束縛、絶對没有絲毫自由、黨的命令要服從、黨的紀律要遵守、進一步說、一個革命黨員、因爲革命的需要、固然要犧牲個人的自由、同時革命的黨和革命的政府、因爲革命的需要、也隨時可以限制黨員與官吏個人的自由、一個革命黨員、不管他在黨的地位如何、不管他在黨的歷史之久暫、也不管他負黨的責任輕重、都一樣的要受黨的約束限制個人的自由、胡同志追隨總理甚久、對於總理的遺教、有深刻的認識、對於革命的大意、當然是會忠實的實行的、他常常勉勵同志、要服從總理的遺教、犧牲個人的自由、去爭民族和國家的自由、黨和政府、因爲革命的需要、時時刻刻可以限制我們自由的、所以胡同志的行動、是否自由、不是甚麽重大的問題、一個革命黨員、原來就不能有個人的自由的、至於在事實上來說、諸位可看胡同志的文字言行、在各報上仍舊照常登載、由此一端、可知前日一切謡言、皆可不攻自破、無待本席詳說了、胡同志因爲避嫌止謗、打算此後長住南京、不赴别處、中央同志、也希望他如此、因爲只有如此、才能保全他過去的歷史、中國二十年來變亂相循、紛擾不止、其中有個很大的原因、就是政治上的負責者、一旦下野、就去租界居住、或到各地搗亂、即使其本人要安居修養、而他左右的環境、亦要來羣起包圍、於是興風作浪、惹是生非、使社會人心永無安寗之日、而且他自己己往的歷史、亦不能保存、甚至於隨着身敗名裂、這種前例甚多、己是屢見不一見了、我們旣然爲這些舊同志可惜、所以更爲胡同志担心、胡同志在黨自有深久的歷史、他的革命的歷史、乃是幾十年奮鬥得來的、不是容易得來的、我們實在不</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>忍見胡同志幾十年的歷史、毀於一旦、所以我們爲公爲私、都要爲他設法來保全他、因此胡同志實在以不離開南京爲是、中央各同志、都是這樣想、胡同志本人、也是這樣想、所以胡同志雖然辭去政府的職務、然而仍是不會離開南京的、總而言之、政府中一個人的進退去留、是一件很平常很普通的事、如果我們自視中國乃爲一有紀律有組織的文明國家、則對於這件事是一件很平常的小事、倘若我們自暴自棄、不當作自己國家是一個國家、不當作自己是一個中國人、以此而大驚小怪起來、就是予反動派和帝國主義者以造謡的機會、這一點各位同位是應當注意的、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>▲只有女子們請求女子參政。没有一個男子請求代女子之職。自願居家充烹飪之勞。只有女子在高唱男女平等。没有一個男子自願兼任女子之職。可見女子愛管他人之事。爲不可掩之事實。</p>
<p>▲一個摩登女子。第一次結婚爲好奇。第二次結婚爲愛情。第三次結婚爲金錢。揆之實事。無一或爽。</p>
<p>▲年紀越老。愛情的代價越重。一個年輕的男子。可以赤手空拳的愛上一個女人。然而一到三十以上。則非有整疊的鈔票和整塊的金剛鑽。就難以吸動一個年輕女人的心了。</p>
<p>▲假使你看明了某種事業的可能而加以實地的工作。你就可以得到成功。假使你知道了限度。你就得到了快樂。</p>
<p>▲一個男子可以追逐一個女人而無倦容。然而一經到手了以後。不免要呼呼地打起呵欠來了。</p>
<p>▲一個女人對於衣服的修飾。所費的時間。遠過於一般的男子。然而現在一個男子所費於穿衣的時間。却又遠過於女子。因爲摩登女子的衣裳。輒較男子少過五倍。</p>
<p>▲一個性情柔和的男子。可以原諒任何人。除欠他銅錢的朋友。和一個與他過不去的女人。</p>
<p>▲隨便什麽人。喜歡給一個勸告給人家、然而没一個人喜歡聽的。更没有一個人能依從的。</p>
<p>▲一般的勸告。就是一種修飾得極好的批評。所以善於批評的人。就是善於勸告的人。</p>

<p>— 游子</p>
<p>靑年姓陳。名繼昌。西藏之東僻人。某日由心邨君之介紹、與之晤談數次。始知其澿漂泊來滬之梗概、爰記之如左。</p>
<p>繼昌幼失怙恃。又無伯叔兄弟姊妹。乃育於外家。八歳時有歐人羅利先生者來藏。半佈道。半經商。見繼昌而憐之。即携歸撫育。於是此孤苦伶仃之孤兒。不啻登現實之天堂矣。</p>
<p>羅利氏醉心科學。發明語言機。消耗研究費凡六萬金鎊　費時二十餘年。始告成功。是機也。凡全球語。殆皆具備。其形類留聲機　重約四十餘磅、惜羅利氏秘不公佈。故世無知者。</p>
<p>繼昌性聰頴。自幼飢而哺。飽而嘻。爲羅利氏稍給役外。即就語言機習語言。每三月畢一種。以故其對於我國國語。頗純熟。漢字亦略可辨識。此外如施土利、英、澳、埃及。爪哇。印度加上尾、西藏、客家、厦門、汕頭、廣東、暹邏、西部等地土語計十三種。均極流利。且曾隨氏往歐四年半。惟氏亦奇人。不告以里居。窮年累月。僕僕道途。故陳年十六歳時。羅利氏忽遺陳於藏。巡去。陳不得己。仍隨舅氏居。其舅某。居心叵測。一日鬻之與蒙古人爲奴。每日烹茗傾溺。拂拭牀椅。稍忤主人意鞭撻立至。繼昌不堪其苦。會主人入蜀貿易　挈繼昌往。一夕乘間亡走。輾轉來滬。川資用罄。腹餒者三日。夜則露臥巷尾。後就印捕與語。憐之。給衣食數日。嗣因某君之介、遇心村先生。心村先生以慈悲爲懷。扶危濟困。不遺餘力。見而異之。爲供食宿。先令補習。將爲謀讀書機會。而陳難之。蓋心邨君爲定自修表、每日寫大小字若干。閱報讀書若干。練習英文若干。令依時實行。晚則遠道來監視。無間日。然陳奴性根深。畏隨懶生。後竟去。繼昌年十八。或以爲非西藏人。實則面瘦削而黧黑。酷嗜吸烟。不嗜洗貿</p>
<p>澡。居然西藏人也。</p>

<p>— 雪痕</p>
<p>花勝競紅。倐越人日。簾捲風柔。又過試燈時節。夫際此推行國歷時代。舊歷之燈節。原如明日黄花。宜鮮齒及之者。惟予旅覊滬瀆。形隻影單。仲宣作賦。蔣舄越吟。缅彼鄉土。懷哉曷己。爰述越中往昔燈節之盛况。藉慰鄉思。有寓滄桑今昔之感焉。</p>
<p>越中燈節之盛。首推路莊之燈臺及陶堰之燈頭。自十三至十五之夜。金吾不禁。傾城若狂。巷盈遺舄。道見墮釧。肩相摩。趾相接。蓋無以喻其盛也。鄉人多於此數日間演戲。曰燈頭戲。演戲旣多。每相距十數步至數十步。即見舞台屹立相望。簫管聲每相接也。其燈則有象人者。象獸者。象物者。象花草者。不一而足。光怪陸離。不可究詰。路莊於賽燈之外。並有賽寳之舉。即司事者假之於當地之大户。古玩也。玉器也。奇珍也。異獸也。均可陳列之。兒時嘗聞里中老人言。曾見六七尺之珊瑚拐杖一枝。綠玉西瓜一枚。數經變故。此物不知又流入誰家矣。然自後世多不靖。此風亦稍稍衰矣。嘗讀鄉先輩李蒓老白華絳跗閣詩集越中燈詞有云。路家莊畔好樓台。十萬春花燭裏開。月下新粧齊出看。前村報舞火龍來。又云。陶　年年燈市新。百家廟裏共嬉春。春星漸亂歌塵歇。燈火家家扶醉人。又云。家居何事答豐年。客裏思來倍惘然第一春宵好風月山川金碧試燈天。掩卷低吟。不禁使軟紅十丈中鄉思加深矣。</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>胡蝶的表現藝術。我們在銀幕上。己經早許爲中國電影界的第一流人物。對於伊淺笑輕颦。微嗔薄怒。以及其他種種動作。即一舉手。一抬足。均己深深印入我們觀衆的腦海中。無往而不含一美字。但余意尚以不能親聆其清脆的歌喉。和膩人的鶯聲爲憾事。</p>
<p>自從西方的有聲片運輸到我國來開映。我也去聽過看過。終覺得國人的進步。萬不及它們的敏捷。當時我曾想不久的將來或者也可以有國産的作品。來抵敵舶來品。東然。不出我料。最近如明星公司的總理張石川先生。他就接受民衆公司的委託。和專製聲片的百代公司聨合起來、費了六閱月時間。切去十二萬的資本。經過四五次的試騐。方始試聲於光陸大戲院。余幸得友人之招。得快先覩。原來新片「歌女紅牡丹」的主角。就是轟傳遐邇。名震一時的胡蝶女士所主演、當女士歌聲初揚之侯。合院觀者掌聲雷動。影畢。各界參觀者羣向明星公司當軸道賀。僉謂國産無聲片的鼻祖是「孤兒救祖記。」國産有聲片的確矢是「歌女紅牡丹」按該片的美點。能緊凑。能前後呼應。能有極深刻的整激性。能使一般女同志放聲大哭。至於其他的挿科和配角。都是一時之選。以余愚見。除張導演胡女士的辛勞外。尤以編劇先生的腦經爲最可佩了。聽說此片海上放映期就在目前。大約將在新光大戲院先映云。」</p>

<p>— 風木</p>
<p>閱自由談。見清癯君記吳中揑像一則。此人余猶及見之。且連類憶及數事。爰併誌之。</p>
<p>（一）揑像　此人髣髴姓徐。其初亦勞工界人。並非貴介公子。且揑像亦不必在深夜。海揑一像。僅售番佛二尊。惟若欲爲其像製四季衣服冠履。及小神龕等。則需數十元至百餘元不等。蓋因成本鉅而爲時亦較久也。其人有一奇癖。苟非至阿芙蓉將盡時。每不肯爲人奏技。此則頗有名士習氣。生平未嘗授徒。蓋難其人選也。有二子。皆不能傳其藝。故死後遂無人繼其業者。惜哉。</p>
<p>（二）蘭葉所製之草蟲　以蘭葉一莖。製成　螂及昨蜢等。皆栩栩欲活。余幼時在元妙觀中時見之。隨售隨製。手術極速。每枚不過售錢三四文。</p>
<p>（三）藥草所製之獮猴　以辛夷一枚爲猴身。以全蟬蛻一個拆散之爲猴之頭與四肢。以甘草一薄片爲其冠。以紅黑豆一料爲桃子。猴有蹲於岩石上者。則海浮石也。每頭亦僅售錢十餘文。</p>
<p>（四）山芋粉製之人物以熟山芋粉。和以五色顔料水。揑成各種人物及戲劇。與惠泉山下要貨店中之泥人無異。而精巧過之以製時手續之繁簡。定價值之多寡。然最貴者亦不滿百文。此藝前十餘年尚偶見之、今則己絶跡。蓋生活程度日高。業此者不能餬其口。故皆改爲他業也。</p>
<p>（五）蓮子雕刻之香珠　以上皆下等社會人所爲。此則爲大家閨閣之所製、法以極老之蓮子。以手揑之極軟。然後以繡花鍼雕刻之。書畫維所欲。惟揑時蓮子每易破裂。非用極輕之手術不可。聞每十枚中能成一二枚。己爲手術最精熟者。俟滿十八粒、以綵絲穿之。即成一串香珠矣。余友潘君翥霄曾有一串。乃其閨人所手製。見之者皆歎爲精巧。</p>
<p>觀於此。則知吾國人最富於美術思想。惜乎無人提倡。任其漂没無聞。甚且如廣陵散之不傳於後。深可慨也。</p>

<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>我當時言到西湖的雷峯塔。其悠久的歷史。足與斜塔並美。直等到不易坍而忽然坍倒了以後。大家還要想再重建。重做歷史古物的　造品。大可不必。還有崑山用直鎭楊惠之的雕刻。等到坍了破廟以後。大家纔嘆息。己故日本人大村西崖在十年前曾經同我說過。你們不去修。我願意發起修理。那時我亦曾對許多人說過。他們那裏顧到這件事。坍了以後。放馬後砲。來不及了。現在纔重建其廟。可是十幾尊佛象。僅留了四五尊。這多麽可惜。但也是我們對古物太没有專門研究的人才的緣故。</p>
<p>我們看到一件古物。能引起歷史。藝術。感情等等的影響極大。文化的根據。也就在這一點。我終覺得中國現在各處有組織美術館的必要。中國的古物。縱令向外國輸送。可是還有很多歷史上的遺産。究竟還没有搬完。南京上海以及其他各省。必須組織古物保存所。（就是美術館）如果有了組織。就有專門人才去研究。</p>
<p>北平的古物博物館。近來辦得很有秩序。天津也相繼發見。難道說首都的南京及東方第一商埠的上海。便没有人去睬這件事嗎。我打定主意。回國後首先宣傳這件事。把國内留心文化事業的人們。也會有點同感罷。</p>

<h3 id="e3">Details of the Destruction of the Huabei (North China) Daily <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nationalist Faction Youths Commit Atrocities</p>
<p>Editor Injured, Newspaper Suspended</p>
<p>(Beiping) As reported yesterday, the Huabei Daily was destroyed by an organized group of over fifty youths and some hired thugs. Several of them, carrying handguns, first had some women pretend to quarrel at the newspaper's entrance, attracting bystanders. The mob then entered the newspaper office in groups of three to five. They blocked the two gatekeepers with quilts and used their handguns to prevent any outcry. Others guarded the telephone lines with handguns. First, they destroyed part of the business department, then some, wielding iron bars, entered the editorial department. Editor Zhu Dazhi, telegraph operators Zhang Mengping, and Tong Songnian were present. Zhu was severely injured first, struck in the head, lower back, and hand with iron bars. Zhang and Tong were also injured by iron bars. A gunman shot Guan, a member of the typesetting room, in the face, the bullet exiting behind his ear. He was sent to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and is in critical condition. Zhu Dazhi's condition worsened today. Zhang Henshui, a friend, advanced funds to send him to the Central Hospital. After destroying the newspaper office, the mob shouted reactionary slogans, causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage. Last night, the newspaper urgently telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang, the Central Government, and the National Government, requesting a strict investigation. Meanwhile, a notice was published announcing a temporary suspension. After the incident, armed police arrived and cut off traffic. One person, Qiu Daozong, was apprehended and taken to the First District for interrogation. Chief Zhu Ruilin said that Qiu Daozong was still denying involvement. However, workers from the Huabei Daily who had been assaulted identified him as one of those who destroyed the typesetting room. Therefore, Qiu could be the key to uncovering the background of this case.</p>
<p>(Beiping) A notice from the Huabei Daily states: At 7:30 PM last night, dozens of thugs, claiming to be from the Nationalist faction, carrying weapons such as handguns, iron bars, wooden clubs, and lime, attacked the editorial and printing departments of this newspaper, destroying everything. More than ten editors and workers were injured by gunshots and iron bars. As the thugs left, they shouted slogans supporting Nationalism. Due to this damage, this newspaper will temporarily suspend publication starting today. In addition to reporting the incident to the Central Government and local military and police authorities, we are also making arrangements to resume publication. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Quanminbao (The People's Gazette) reports that besides guns and clubs, the mob that stormed the Huabei Daily also carried items such as eggs and kerosene. They fired two shots, one missing and the other hitting a gatekeeper in the face. They also scattered lime and kerosene on the ground, seemingly intending to start a fire. Many workers were injured in the eyes by the lime. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong advocates for a strict investigation of the instigators behind the destruction of the Huabei Daily, charging them with disturbing public order. Qiu, who was arrested last night, has been interrogated once by the district. A thorough investigation of the entire case is not difficult. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Newspaper Association has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow noon to discuss how to deal with the destruction of the Huabei Daily. The provincial and municipal party headquarters also held a meeting this morning, with Zhang Ji attending. He advocated for a strict investigation of the Nationalist faction's rioters. Qiu Daozong, arrested last night, is 30 years old, from Hunan, and remains uncooperative. He was transferred from the district to the Public Security Bureau. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">He Yingqin Explains the Truth About Hu Hanmin's Resignation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) During this week’s memorial service for the Director-General at the Military Headquarters, He Yingqin reported on the matter of Legislative Yuan President Hu Hanmin’s resignation, stating that he felt obliged to report to everyone today. Because Comrade Hu bears significant responsibility within the Party and the nation, now that he has resigned, those who do not understand the situation are bound to make some pointless speculations. While Comrade Hu’s resignation is partly due to overwork and illness, the main reason is that his personal views on the National Assembly and the Provisional Constitution differ from those of his Central Committee colleagues. Originally, the Provisional Constitution is the guarantee of the people’s lives and property. With a clear guarantee of the people’s lives and property, unification and construction can be achieved with fewer difficulties. The Director-General defined the revolution as having three phases: military law, provisional constitution, and constitution. Therefore, during the period of political tutelage, there should be a provisional constitution, which all people in the nation should publicly abide by. This is no different from adding a strong guarantee for the nation’s permanent peace. Comrade Hu resigned because his views differed from those of his colleagues in the Central Committee, demonstrating his personal political stance. In order to complete the Provisional Constitution, the Central Committee had no choice but to approve his resignation. Ordinary Chinese people tend to speculate about everything based on personal relationships. If we understand the stance of the entire Party, we will know that this kind of event is very common and represents a kind of progress in our nation's politics. This is what I hope all comrades will understand. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, Zhang Ji and Xu Xinwu reported at the memorial service that Hu Hanmin's resignation was an unavoidable measure to maintain the overall situation. The Central Committee approved Hu's resignation not out of anger. Hu's health has always been weak, and his illness is due to overwork. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Speculations After the Establishment of the Franco-Italian Naval Agreement <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In this era when the nerves of people worldwide are highly sensitive, upon hearing unfavorable news, speculators will inevitably exhaust the most extreme negative consequences to shock and astound the world. Conversely, upon hearing relatively positive news, speculators will also exhaust their positive hopes to spread rumors. The reason is the speed of change in worldly affairs. Every piece of news, whether good or bad, often has the potential to reach its extreme. Therefore, any speculation is not without foundation. Moreover, given the complex relationships in the world, all news, good or bad, can be used as a means to benefit. Those who hear a piece of news and speculate about its extreme consequences each have their own motives and are not acting rashly. For example, the previous Franco-Italian naval dispute, coupled with other disagreements, led some to speculate that another world war would soon erupt. Today, with the establishment of the Franco-Italian naval agreement, as reported in yesterday's telegram, the fleets of France and Italy will visit each other. The heads of state of France and Italy will also visit each other. Important political issues between France and Italy will also be negotiated. It seems as if the closeness between France and Italy will be unprecedented. The vicissitudes of international affairs are indeed so unpredictable.</p>
<p>In short, events in the world are changing rapidly nowadays. However, the psychology of speculators sees changes in the world as even more rapid.</p>

<p>FOREIGN TELEGRAMS Soviet Union Congress Opens</p>
<p>Chairman Reports on Foreign Affairs and Domestic Politics</p>
<p>Praises Success of Social Policies</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 9th The Soviet Union Congress opened today. Chairman Molotov reported on the general situation of Soviet-foreign relations. Regarding relations with China, he said that he hoped the Sino-Soviet conference would achieve satisfactory results, but Russia is now carefully watching actions that disrupt peace in the Far East. He then discussed the important changes in the Soviet Union's status over the past two years, saying that the great success of industrial transformation shows that Soviet socialism has certainly succeeded. However, as a result of the four-year activities of the Disarmament Committee, the danger of war has already occurred. He also said that Soviet exports to Britain have increased by 50% in the past year, valued at £15 million in gold. Relations with Japan are developing as usual, and economic relations between the two countries have greatly improved. However, relations with France and Poland are not satisfactory. France's attitude toward Russia is particularly dangerous to peace. The United States also has anti-Russian tendencies, and the representatives of the Roman Pope often agitate for intervention in Russian affairs, which is very despicable, and so on.</p>

<p>Economic Panic Intensifies</p>
<p>Peasants Are Restless</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 8th Although the political situation in Hungary appears to be calm, beneath the surface, it has become increasingly tense in recent weeks. Government officials are uneasy and are giving it serious consideration. This is because the economic panic is intensifying. Even opposition parties and peasants who were not very active in the past are becoming restless. Farmers in general feel that their livelihoods are worsening day by day and are becoming increasingly restless. Recently, they have organized an independent party, claiming that the government's industrial policy hinders the interests of most farmers and have begun an opposition movement. In addition, radical elements of the country's right wing are plotting to contact them and attempt to take them over and become their leaders.</p>

<p>Three consecutive shocks in one day, unprecedented</p>
<p>The Vardar River basin was the hardest hit</p>
<p>The epicenter is southeast of Belgrade</p>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of houses collapsed</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Salonika, 8th  It is now known that the intensity of the earthquake on Friday night was unprecedented in the Balkans. There were three consecutive shocks, one at midnight, one at 2:30 a.m., and one at 3:00 a.m. The most severe damage was in the Therma area and the Vardar River basin. Even here, tremors were felt. The city of Valandovo in the Vardar River basin was particularly hard hit, with many houses collapsing. Even the city hall and many churches were severely damaged. One hundred and fifty houses also collapsed in Nirovasa, with total losses reaching millions. Land near Veles cracked, burying 200 sheep, shepherds, and sheepdogs in a deep abyss. There are also many places with no news due to traffic congestion.</p>
<p>▲National News, Belgrade, 9th  The areas that experienced the earthquake twenty-four hours ago reported another strong earthquake. However, because traffic in all areas has been completely cut off, news is scarce. According to news from Athens and Sofia, the death toll from the earthquake in various areas is feared to be close to one thousand, and the number of injured is likely to be several times that. The epicenter is 650 kilometers southeast of the Yugoslav capital. The most recent earthquake lasted for more than an hour. The needles of seismographs everywhere went out of order. The entire Balkan region felt the tremors, with Greece and Yugoslavia suffering the most damage. Many villages and towns in the Vardar River basin were completely destroyed. The number of houses that collapsed in various places often numbered in the hundreds and thousands. The Greek and South governments have rushed to provide emergency relief, but railway bridges have been destroyed in many places, making relief difficult. The King of the South and the Prime Minister departed last night to visit the disaster area, but they are still blocked on the way and have not been able to reach the Vardar River basin. Now, after the earthquake, rivers in various places have been blocked and have caused floods. Therefore, the severity of this disaster is unprecedented in the history of the Balkans.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Belgrade, 8th  Yugoslavia has suffered successive earthquakes in the past 48 hours. Government officials reported 24 deaths and 78 injuries, but this number is not complete because telephone traffic in many places has now been cut off.  ▲Reuters, Sofia, 8th  An earthquake occurred in Bulgaria this morning.

Tokyo also felt a considerable amount of widespread shaking.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 9th  According to current reports, the area where the earthquake was felt in northern and central Japan is quite wide, but there have been no major losses. It has been found that there were a total of 11,972 earthquakes of various sizes in Japan last year, which is four and a half times more than the annual average.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Port Louis, 8th  A large hurricane, unseen in 20 years, blew through the British Mauritius in the Indian Ocean on Thursday, causing considerable damage.

Many trees have been uprooted, and all the sugarcane has been blown down. Agricultural crops have been damaged, and harvesting will be very difficult. Telegraph and telephone traffic is interrupted. The railway also cannot pass due to flooding and landslides.  ▲American United Press, New York, 8th  Most of Europe and North America are experiencing rain and snow, coupled with strong winds, making navigation in the North Atlantic very dangerous. In Chicago and the surrounding area, at least a dozen people have died due to wind and snow. According to news from Chicago, the police station estimates that no fewer than tens of thousands of cars have been abandoned on the road. Even wide roads are now impassable for cars. Trains in many places are still suspended. Dozens of towns have been cut off from the outside world due to snow accumulation. Telephone and telegraph lines have been interrupted due to wind, snow, and pressure. The wind and snow have lasted for more than 24 hours. Ships on the Atlantic coast of the United States cannot depart on schedule. In many places, food prices have soared due to the suspension of transportation. Many small coastal boats have been lost in the wind and snow. Such weather in March in the spring is truly rare.</p>

The news that Hu was seriously ill and the newspaper reports that he was on a hunger strike while he was at Tangshan were completely inaccurate. (Details of the speech are provided separately.) The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chairman Chiang's Report on Hu's Resignation <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>▲Regarding Hu's illness and his place of residence  The National Government held a memorial week for the Premier on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Jiang reported on Hu Hanmin's illness and his future place of residence. The original words are as follows: "Comrades, Comrade Hu Hanmin resigned due to illness because his views on the provisional constitution differed from those of the majority of the Central Committee members. I have already reported this matter to you at the last memorial week. The Central Committee held a temporary standing committee meeting last Monday and resolved to approve his resignation to fulfill his personal ambitions. It also elected Comrade Lin Sen as the President of the Legislative Yuan and Comrade Shao Yuanchong as the member of the National Government and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. You comrades have probably seen these things in the newspaper. After Comrade Hu resigned, the next morning, he and Comrade Shao Yuanchong went to Tangshan to recuperate. This is the process of Comrade Hu's resignation and departure to Tangshan. Originally, it is a very ordinary and commonplace thing for a political official to retire and resign due to political disagreements, and there is no need to be surprised. In countries with a political system and a high level of political knowledge among the people, when this type of event occurs, the people see it as very ordinary and will never be alarmed or engage in idle speculation. However, since Comrade Hu resigned, in the past week, many strange rumors have arisen, even saying that Comrade Hu's illness was serious, with a temperature of 105 degrees, and that he had fainted twice in one day. In fact, according to the formal diagnosis report of Director Liu of the Health Department on the same day, Comrade Hu was resting quietly in Tangshan, with a body temperature of 99 degrees and a pulse of 72 to 90, all normal. However, he has always suffered from post-wax neuralgia and high blood pressure. According to doctors, the source of this disease has been around for a long time, at least a year ago, so it cannot be cured in a short period of time. The poems and essays he wrote in Tangshan have also been published in the newspapers. The day before yesterday, Director Liu reported again that Comrade Hu has now returned to normal, with no abnormalities in temperature or pulse. However, some people deliberately want to make this very ordinary matter very serious and even create many alarming and sensational news items out of nothing, which is extremely despicable. As for the reactionary elements and the newspapers of a certain country, fearing that China will not be in chaos, they will naturally take this opportunity to fabricate facts and spread rumors in order to achieve their conspiracy to confuse the public and shake people's hearts. You comrades should see the facts clearly and not be easily blinded by rumors, lest you fall into the trap. We can also use this to test the stability of the foundation of our doctrine because the harm of a certain country's newspapers spreading rumors makes us feel that our politics are on track, that the party members' understanding of the doctrine and their clarity on public and private matters will not be like in previous years, with personal feelings forgetting the party members' responsibilities and affecting the entire political situation. This is indeed enough to make the imperialists feel frightened and uneasy. Comrade Hu returned to his private residence in Nanjing yesterday. As for Comrade Hu's future actions, I should also report to everyone today. Some people seem to be concerned about whether Comrade Hu's actions are free. On this point, it seems necessary to explain to everyone. In principle, no one can be free in the actions of revolutionary party members. Even my own words and deeds are subject to the sanctions and restrictions of the Central Committee and the National Government at all times, with absolutely no room for freedom. The Premier often said that the freedom we are fighting for is the freedom of the country, the freedom of the nation, not the freedom of the individual. If the individual wants freedom, then the country and the nation cannot obtain freedom. These are the principles that the Premier has often taught us. These principles were also mentioned by Comrade Hu Hanmin when he lectured on the legacy of the Premier during the National Government Memorial Week last month, saying that officials and party members have no freedom. This is the essence of the revolution. Therefore, the thoughts and actions of a revolutionary party member should be subject to the rules and constraints of the party, with absolutely no freedom. Party orders must be obeyed, and party discipline must be observed. Furthermore, a revolutionary party member must sacrifice his personal freedom for the needs of the revolution. At the same time, the revolutionary party and the revolutionary government can also restrict the personal freedom of party members and officials at any time for the needs of the revolution. A revolutionary party member, regardless of his position in the party, regardless of the length of his history in the party, and regardless of the weight of his responsibilities to the party, must be equally subject to the party's constraints and restrictions on personal freedom. Comrade Hu has followed the Premier for a long time, has a deep understanding of the Premier's legacy, and will certainly faithfully implement the great meaning of the revolution. He often encourages comrades to obey the Premier's legacy, sacrifice personal freedom, and fight for the freedom of the nation and the country. The party and the government can restrict our freedom at any time for the needs of the revolution. Therefore, whether Comrade Hu's actions are free is not a major issue. A revolutionary party member cannot have personal freedom in the first place. As for the facts, you can see that Comrade Hu's writings and speeches are still published in the newspapers as usual. From this point alone, it can be seen that all the rumors of the previous day can be refuted without any further explanation from me. Comrade Hu intends to reside in Nanjing for a long time in the future in order to avoid suspicion and stop slander. The comrades of the Central Committee also hope that he will do so because only in this way can he preserve his past history. China has been in turmoil for the past 20 years, and there has been no end to the disturbances. One of the big reasons is that the political officials in charge, once they step down, go to live in the concessions or cause trouble in various places. Even if they want to live in peace and recuperate, the environment around them will come and surround them, causing trouble and creating trouble, so that the hearts of the people will never be at peace. Moreover, their own past history cannot be preserved, and they even end up ruined and discredited. There are many such precedents, and it has been seen many times. We already feel sorry for these old comrades, so we are even more worried about Comrade Hu. Comrade Hu has a deep and long history in the party. His revolutionary history has been earned through decades of struggle and was not easily obtained. We really do not</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>bear to see Comrade Hu's decades of history ruined in one fell swoop, so we must try to protect him for both public and private reasons. Therefore, it is essential for Comrade Hu not to leave Nanjing. All the comrades of the Central Committee think this way, and Comrade Hu himself thinks this way too. Therefore, although Comrade Hu has resigned from his government post, he will still not leave Nanjing. In short, the advancement, retreat, departure, and retention of a person in the government is a very ordinary and commonplace matter. If we regard China as a disciplined and organized civilized country, then this matter is a very ordinary small matter. If we abandon ourselves and do not treat our own country as a country and do not treat ourselves as Chinese, and become alarmed, we will give the reactionaries and imperialists an opportunity to spread rumors. This is something you comrades should pay attention to."</p>

<p>▲Li Shizeng oversees and delivers a speech</p>
<p>▲Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng responds</p>
<p>Chairman of the Huai River Guidance Committee Jiang Zhongzheng, acting vice chairman Zhuang Songfu, members Wu Jingheng, Chen Lifu, Xu Shiying, Chen Qicai, Yang Yongtai, Chen Yi, and twelve others held an oath-taking ceremony at 10 a.m. on the 9th after the National Government's Memorial Week. Chairman Jiang presided. After the ceremony, the oath-taking ceremony was held. Central Committee member Li Shizeng supervised the oath-taking. Those who took the oath raised their right hands. After the oath, supervisor Li Shizeng gave a speech, stating that the Huai River guidance work is extremely important. Everyone knows that the purpose of the Premier's revolution is construction, and destruction is a means to achieve construction. Therefore, the Premier's legacy contains detailed plans for various local construction projects, such as railways and water conservancy. Guiding the Huai River is also one of the local undertakings, but its importance is sufficient to express the spirit of the Premier's legacy, so it cannot be regarded as local and cannot be incorporated into any organization. Therefore, the government has set up a special agency and appointed the Chairman as the Chairman of the Committee, which shows its importance. Next, Jiang responded, stating that the Huai River is located between the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. If the Huai River is successfully guided, the people's livelihood problem can be solved. From a historical perspective, there have been many disturbances caused by the unrest and lack of stable employment of the people in the Huai River basin. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to the Huai River guidance work, and the priority and importance of construction work should be known. Therefore, I have taken on this position, and in the future, I will follow the supervisor's speech and work together with the committee members to complete this major task and fulfill my own responsibilities. After the response, music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Hubei Provincial Government Borrows Money from the Business Community Again <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>▲He Chengjun proposes to the business community</p>
<p>▲Still using business tax as collateral</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Hubei Provincial Government Chairman He Chengjun hosted a banquet yesterday (7th) at Puhaichun to entertain the executive and supervisory committee members of the Wuhan Business Association and the Hanyang Business Association, the Provincial Business Federation, the Hankou Banking Association, the Owners' Association, and the China Communications and other bank presidents. Mayor Liu Wendao, bureau chiefs of the municipal government, and committee and department heads of the provincial government were also invited to accompany. They took their seats at 7 p.m. During the banquet, He delivered a speech, stating that during the Lunar New Year, he had borrowed 600,000 yuan from the business and banking communities with a spirit of mutual assistance, and he was extremely grateful for overcoming the difficulties. Recently, the provincial government has been implementing a business tax to replace the Likin tax, and he hopes that this new tax will make new progress. Although Wuhan is actively discussing all collection procedures and standards, Yisha is still under investigation. Although the government is urgently collecting this tax, it is not yet available, and the financial difficulties of the provincial government are increasing. Now, because the business tax cannot solve the immediate need, he had no choice but to discuss with the Hankou Business Association to borrow some money with the business tax as collateral to solve the immediate need. As for all the preparatory measures, they will be discussed in detail by Director Zhang of the Finance Department. He asked the executive and supervisory committee members of the business community to especially understand the provincial government's difficulties and provide assistance. After He finished speaking, He Hengfu, chairman of the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, stood up to reply, stating that he was unworthy of Chairman He's invitation to the banquet today. The colleagues deeply understand the difficult situation of the government's finances. The business community has repeatedly stated that it will strongly support the implementation of the business tax. The promotion committee jointly organized by officials and businessmen now has a concrete plan for all the measures of the business tax, and a detailed report will be submitted soon for the provincial and municipal governments to adopt and implement. Today, Chairman He personally instructed on the borrowing of money, and he respectfully accepted it on behalf of the entire business community. After He finished speaking, Huang Wenzhi also stood up to speak. The meeting did not end until about 9 p.m. He then went to the round table in front of his seat and held a talk similar to a round table conference with He Hengfu, Huang Wenzhi, Chen Jingyu, Liu Wendao, Zhang Guanshi, Wu Xingya, and others to exchange views on the issue of borrowing money. The content is unknown. However, according to what important leaders of the business community said, the business tax in Hubei Province is in progress, but the collection procedures and tax rate standards cannot be planned properly in a short period of time. The authorities had already included this tax revenue in the official budget, and when the money was borrowed during the New Year, they had promised to use this tax revenue as collateral for paying the principal and interest. However, this time, the borrowing was again designated as collateral, and the borrowing procedures were also different from the usual practice. It was found that all previous loans from the provincial government and the business community were not directly borrowed from the business association, and the business association asked itself that it did not have such a large capacity. Therefore, at the round table talk, the business community asked the provincial government to follow the previous practice, that is, to take the discount method from a certain bank or to borrow against the collateral of a certain bank. The business association would then issue a letter of guarantee or act as a third party as usual, so that the money borrowed this time could be received as soon as possible to solve the urgent need. The government side agreed very much. During the round table talk, the issue of issuing Hubei Rehabilitation Public Bonds was also discussed. It was found that the total amount of the rehabilitation public bonds was 3 million yuan, and Wuhan was allocated as much as 2.75 million yuan. Let alone the fact that all 3 million yuan were allocated by Wuhan, it was not impossible, but the provincial government should separately solicit and allocate, and should not allocate entirely according to the number. For example, the Owners' Association was allocated 500,000 yuan, but the Owners' Association did not have such a capacity in principal and interest. It is expected that the results of the rehabilitation public bonds will be difficult to predict in the future if they are not solicited and sold according to the old practice of customs duties or cigarette bonds. The provincial government agreed very much with the business association's intention. It was heard that the leaders of the Wuhan Business Association, the Banking Association, and the Owners' Association will be convened to discuss the solicitation methods in detail to ensure fair distribution.

<p>▲ Also Superintends Clearing Up of the Border Areas of Three Provinces</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The communist bandits led by He Long, who have been causing trouble in western Hunan and western Hubei, fled from Hefeng to Changyang after being surrounded and suppressed by the Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan armies. After fleeing to western Hunan again, they were intercepted by Li Jue's troops and others, and were forced to retreat to the territory of Wufeng County, where they were heavily besieged. The bandit gang under the command of Duan Dechang, occupying Ouchi, numbering about two thousand, seemed to have the intention of restraining the government troops. Xu Yuanquan then ordered Zhang Zhenhan's brigade to attack Ouchi on the first day, and Xu Jiwu and Han Changjun's two brigades to attack Bailu Lake. After the Duan bandits were cleared, he would use all his strength to attack He's bandits. Zhang's brigade set off on that day and engaged in a fierce battle with Duan's bandits for half a day, killing six hundred bandits and capturing more than one hundred alive. The remnants fled to Shishou. The brigade then completely occupied Ouchi and immediately led its troops across the river in pursuit. The two brigades of Xu and Han, attacking Bailu Lake, attacked the southwest of Bailu Lake by Xu's brigade, and the north of Bailu Lake by Han's brigade. They were simultaneously engaged in suppression. Xu's brigade successively captured the Qinjia Chang, Lujia Xiang, and Shagang areas, and Han's brigade also recovered Longwan and continued to suppress them. The two banks of the Yangtze River below Shashi will be cleared up within days. Furthermore, Xu Yuanquan took office yesterday, the 5th, in Shashi as the Superintendent for Suppressing Bandits and Clearing Up of the Border Areas of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. Gu Gengye, dispatched by the Wuhan Executive Headquarters, administered the oath. Xu has already telegraphed a report of his assumption of office. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Plan to Rescue the Financial Situation of Fujian Province <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>▲ Issuing Treasury Bonds of 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Establishing a Local Industrial Bank</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government, due to financial difficulties after the abolition of the likin tax, resolved to issue the second phase of local public bonds of 2,000,000 yuan and establish a local industrial bank to provide relief. Now, the Provincial Government considers that the issuance of public bonds must be approved by the National Government, and the regulations must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, which is a complicated procedure. Therefore, it has changed to issuing treasury bonds of 500,000 yuan, using the central government's monthly subsidy of 150,000 yuan as collateral. The principal and interest will be directly collected from the Central Bank of Fuzhou by the bondholders on a regular basis, in order to simplify the process. It is also heard that the use of these bonds has been designated for handling the reorganization of local troops. As for the local industrial bank, the Department of Finance has also hired Chen Peikun, Shi Jialin, Luo Mianhou, and Lin Chuncheng as four preparatory members. The bank's address is located at the old site of the former Fujian Bank in Yangqiao Lane in the city. The capital is 500,000 yuan, with the government and merchants each contributing half. Chen Peikun is in contact with the Xiamen merchant shares, and Lin Chuncheng is in contact with the Fuzhou merchant shares. They are currently working separately. In addition, the Department of Finance has also decided that from April, all direct income of various agencies, such as the highway donation of the Department of Construction, water dock rent, land price of the remaining road, vehicle donation of the Public Security Bureau of various provinces, prostitution donation, and business protection fee and ship license fee of the Water Public Security Bureau, etc., will be uniformly collected by the Department of Finance in order to standardize revenue and expenditure and establish a financial system.

<h3 id="e57">Fujian and Jiangxi Armies Jointly Suppress Communist Bandits <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhu and Mao's Gangs Flee to Ruijin and Shicheng</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The communist bandits of the pseudo 38th Army led by Zuo Shizan, who fled from Guangfeng and Yanshan on the Jiangxi border into Chong'an and Pucheng in Fujian Province, have been defeated by the provincial defense army Qian Yuguang's brigade. However, the villages on the border of Chong'an and Pucheng, adjacent to the Jiangxi border, have winding mountains and crisscrossing paths, and local communist bandits still appear and harass them. Qian's brigade is now dispatching two regiments, Zhang Chunguang and Jiang Zhaoji, to conduct searches and suppress the remaining bandits in order to clear them. The Jiangxi army Tang's brigade is also pursuing from Guangfeng and Yanshan towards the Fujian border, and has telegraphed Qian's brigade to send troops to attack from both sides in order to eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible. As for the main force of communist bandits led by Zhu and Mao, after He Yingqin ordered the various divisions of Xu Kexiang, Mao Bingwen, and Cai Tingkai to encircle and attack them, they have retreated from Guangchang and Ningdu to Ruijin and Shicheng. Their advance bandit units have already reached Qingxi and Junling on the Fujian border. The defenses of Ninghua and Changting counties are therefore once again strained. Yesterday, the Provincial Government received telegrams from Lu Xingbang and Liu Heding, reporting that Changting has been stationed in by Lu Xingbang's regiment led by Lu Xinming from Liancheng. The two key passes of Gucheng and Shuikou, which enter Fujian from Jiangxi, are also guarded by two battalions led by Ye Xiangpu and Yu Zhipeng under Lu Xinming. As for the Zhou Zhiqian brigade originally stationed in Ninghua, Liu Heding ordered it to advance towards the Jiangxi border to contact Xu Kexiang's division in Nanfeng. At the same time, the Provincial Government also received a telegram from He Yingqin, saying that two more divisions of troops have been dispatched from the Ji'an area, pursuing Zhu and Mao's communist bandits in three routes. Regarding the Fujian border defense, Zhang and Liu's two divisions and Lu and Zhou's two brigades are requested to make strict arrangements and prepare to encircle and suppress them. Judging from this situation, the bandit suppression work has been moved from the eastern part of Jiangxi Province to the Fujian-Jiangxi border. (March 6th)</p>

<p>▲ Four to Five Hundred Bandits Killed</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Xuzhou is adjacent to eastern Henan to the west, and bandit gangs can easily appear and disappear. It is often difficult to suppress them completely as they flee from here to there. On the morning of the 5th, about two thousand bandit gangs suddenly appeared at Yanglou Station on the Longhai Railway west of Xuzhou. They were well-equipped with firearms. The bandits claimed to be former subordinates of Li Yong'an, the commander of the Independent Fourth Brigade, who were surrounded and disarmed in Xiao County by the 52nd Division and sent to Bian for execution by firing squad. They had come specifically to seek revenge and aid Xiao. At that time, a westbound passenger train arrived at the station but was not allowed to pass and returned to Shan, delaying its arrival in Xu for half a day. Upon hearing the news, Du Run, the commander of the 40th Regiment of the 7th Division, immediately telegraphed the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters and dispatched troops to pursue. Wang Jun, upon receiving the report, in addition to ordering Du's regiment to suppress the bandits, also ordered Gao Qiming, the commander of the 28th Regiment stationed at Jiulishan, to dispatch troops to intercept them. Du's regiment advanced from north to south, and Gao's regiment advanced from east to west. They arrived at the Qulipu area in the northern part of Xiao County and learned that the bandits were two gangs led by Yang Xie and Zhang Laoguo, who had fled from Henan after being defeated. They occupied the Qulipu fortress and resisted. It was the morning of the 6th. The troops of Du and Gao's two regiments surrounded Qulipu and launched an attack. After a day of fierce fighting, four to five hundred bandits were killed. The bandits could not hold out and fled southwest. Du and Gao's two regiments immediately searched and advanced, and also made contact with Hu Zongnan's First Division stationed in Yongcheng, eastern Henan, in order to eliminate the bandits as soon as possible.

<p>▲ Waiting for the Central Government to Resolve</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Bengbu Branch of the Huaiyuan Sailing Rice Ration Donation Inspection Office in northern Anhui, recently detained rice boats of shipping merchants and shot and wounded petitioning boatmen, arousing public anger among merchants and residents in Bengbu. On the 4th, all merchants went on strike to express their unanimous opposition. Seeing this situation, the authorities immediately convened a joint meeting of military and police agencies and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, and resolved to earnestly persuade the shops to open for business separately, so as to avoid commercial losses. As for the rice donation issue, they would wait for the central government to resolve it. On the 5th, all the shops in the town resumed business. On the same day, various labor unions and organizations telegraphed the central government again, requesting it to quickly send a senior official or a military officer stationed nearby to forcibly abolish the rice donation along the Huai River in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Julanggang Mountain area in Linqu, eastern Shandong, has overlapping mountains and a strategic location. It has always been a den for bandits. The bandit leader Wang Baichuan has been entrenched in this mountain and resisting government troops for more than a day. Wang once served as the military supplies officer of Dou Baozhang. Now his bandit gang has about four hundred people. Recently, they have been causing trouble in the border areas of Yidu, Linqu, Anqiu, and Ju County, and they are very rampant. They have kidnapped more than two hundred hostages, and they rape, loot, and burn everywhere. The people are living in misery. Recently, they fled to Lijiapo in the western border of Anqiu and had a fierce battle with the local Lian Zhuang Hui (United Village Association). The Lian Jiang Hui was outnumbered and defeated, and fifty to sixty members of the militia were killed and many were injured. Fortunately, the 58th Brigade of Zhan Shutang came to the rescue and dispersed the bandits. Later, they fled to Jiangyu Town in the southern border of Linqu and carried out a large-scale burning and looting. The number of people brutally killed by them is countless. It is now heard that Wang Baichuan led the bandit gang and carried hundreds of male and female hostages back to their old nest in Julanggang Mountain. The tragic burning situation in the nearby villages is unbearable to witness. The bandits have stored a lot of grain in the mountains, and there is a large pool inside for drinking water. There are also natural barriers, so the army has repeatedly failed to encircle and suppress them. Zhao Mingyuan, the commander-in-chief of the Shandong Civil Corps, on the 4th, specially assembled the civil corps from Weixian, Shouguang, Changle, Yidu, and Linqu counties, as well as more than a thousand officers and soldiers from the First Battalion and First Company of the Civil Corps directly under the headquarters, to launch a large-scale suppression. Zhao was also afraid that the troops were weak, so he sent a letter to Qiao Lizhi, the commander of the 74th Division, requesting him to send a battalion of infantry, a company of mortars, and a company of machine guns to join the encirclement and suppression, so as to achieve a synergistic effect. It is expected that the elimination of the bandits can be expected. (March 6th)</p>

<p>The County Government Interrogates Bandit's Wife: Tao Linshi, the wife of Tao A'da, who was apprehended by the Shanyang Police Team, was interrogated by the County Government this morning (9th). According to her confession, she has been having an affair with Tao A'da for many years. A'da was previously arrested for smuggling salt and sentenced to six years in prison. He escaped during the chaos of war in previous years and returned to settle in Shanghai after moving to various places. When A'da came, he brought several people with him. When asked if Taibao A'shu had come, she replied that he had never been there and that she did not know him.

<p>Banquets Affect Restaurant Business: Since the implementation of the banquet donation in Wuxi, it has been contracted out by various places in the city and countryside. In rural areas, the tu zheng (village head) or xiang zhang (township head) contracts the levy in his own tu (village) and dispatches inspectors to harass people. Even gatherings for simple meals costing only about one yuan are required to pay donations, causing public resentment and numerous complaints to the county government. The county government discussed the matter at the county political meeting and decided that all self-organized banquets for weddings, funerals, and celebrations would be exempt from donations. Recently, the restaurant industry stated that since they collect money from customers along with the dishes, they are only fulfilling an obligation. Now that self-organized banquets are exempt from donations, while the restaurant industry still has to pay donations, it has greatly affected their business. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the county Chamber of Commerce to notify the collection office to temporarily suspend the collection starting from this month in order to maintain their business.</p>

Yesterday, a document was prepared and transferred to the County Court for interrogation and judgment.</p>

The matter was discovered by her husband, Hua Ashou, who went to Feng's house to search. He found his wife, Yang, and her lover, Feng Peigen, as well as Shi Dingwen (a young man from the Wansheng Yu Southern Goods Store), chatting intimately.

<p>Robbery of Arms Case at Taiziwei Port: Exclusive News</p>
<p>On February 10th, the Third District Shazhou Hucao Port Taiziwei Port, Sixth Jia Group case of arms and ammunition robbery and the wounding of a squad leader by bandits has not been solved yet. A few days ago, a small vendor from northern Jiangsu came south and mentioned in Hucao Port that the Rugao Zhanghuang Port Public Security Team had seized a bandit ship while on patrol to the port on the evening of the 15th of last month. Thirty-odd bandits were found, and ten rifles and more than ten Mauser pistols were found after searching. It was confirmed that there were two Mauser rifles, two Type 38 rifles, and one Mauser pistol, all branded with the Jiangyin County Anti-Banditry Committee's firemark. According to the bandits, the arms were robbed from Taiziwei Port. The former Jia Group leader of the district, Chen Songshan, after hearing the news, intends to send people to Zhanghuang Port to investigate the matter to determine whether it is true before deciding on a course of action.</p>
<p>Plotting a Riot: Reformed Militiamen</p>
<p>The Sixth District Huangtan Sixth Jia Security Regiment was incited by a reformed militiaman named Shi Dechen to incite incumbent militiamen such as Yang Chunbao. On the night of the 6th, they forced the sentry Li Youcai to surrender his gun without success, only obtaining nine rounds of ammunition. They attempted to falsely report a bandit alarm to lure out the squad leader and kill the Jia Group leader Zhou Zhaonan. Fortunately, their plot was discovered early, and Yang was arrested. Shi Dechen was also arrested in Yutang and sent to the Xishiqiao District Regiment Headquarters late on the night of the 7th for interrogation, with plans to send him to the county for questioning on the 8th.</p>
<p>Meningitis Spreads in Jiangyin</p>
<p>Epidemic meningitis is rampant in the neighboring county of Wuxi. Recently, it has spread to Xiyangqiao in the Fourteenth District of Jiangyin. A few days ago, the sixteen-year-old younger brother of Zhou Guigen, who runs a grain store, suddenly contracted the disease. Initially, it was suspected to be acute heatstroke, but acupuncture treatment was ineffective and he died. The next day, Guigen's uncle, Xingquan, also contracted the disease and died by daybreak. The spread is extremely rapid in the area, and there are no hospitals, making the situation quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Patrol Team Leader Penalized in Red Pill Case</p>
<p>Xu Youxiang, the owner of the Baosheng Pharmacy in Hexiangqiao, Wenlin Township, Thirteenth District, was found to be selling red pills. A few days ago, the patrol team leader of the Second District of the Xishui Public Security Team, Ji Boqin, seized many red pills and smoking paraphernalia. Xu Youxiang was also arrested and detained by the town's security regiment. Soon after, Captain Ji released him after fining him 160 yuan, and the smoking paraphernalia and red pills were confiscated.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Prepares to Interrogate Land Case</p>
<p>The head of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Dun, ordered the investigation team leader to arrest Huang Bingying. Late the night before, the Section Chief of the Third Section, Li Jialin, interrogated Huang, who stated that he did not smoke opium. Huang wanted to know who was accusing him and if the accuser would take responsibility and accompany them in an investigation. Li said that Huang did not look like he smoked opium, and that since he did not smoke, there was no problem. Then, the interrogation turned to the land accusation. Huang first replied that it was not within the scope of the case, and since it was not an official discussion, he would not sign anything. Section Chief Li agreed. Huang said that the reports to the province were all common knowledge in society and that evidence should be investigated by the province. As for the bribery and indulgence of Lu Longzong, he should be arrested and brought to justice. As for the claim of officials occupying the remaining land, he was not involved in the payment and did not know how many silver dollars the officials had or how much land the clerks had divided. What was strange was that the county magistrate, Li Leng, usually valued public opinion, but when the case was widely reported, he acted deaf and dumb, unsure of how he would explain himself. The points made by the party newspaper to clarify the situation were also questionable, and Huang did not have the complex mindset to judge. In short, as for all the points he accused, if County Magistrate Li believed it damaged his reputation, he could file a lawsuit after the administrative litigation was completed. If the judiciary required him to be responsible, he would discuss it with the magistrate. The interrogation lasted for three hours. Huang Bingying was then told that he could be released on bail with a written guarantee pending the investigation of the land case. After the interrogation, Wu Pansheng bailed him out.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Residents Request Reinstatement of Rice Market</p>
<p>Hundreds of Zhenjiang citizens, including Ma Lianqing and Yu Zhongding, submitted petitions to the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and various departments yesterday regarding the reinstatement of the rice market. The petitions stated that Zhenjiang has a strong geographical location, serving as a hub between the north and south. In the early years of the Guangxu era of the late Qing dynasty, the rice market was located in places like Liuhaokou across the river from Zhenjiang. Due to the collapse of the riverbank, it was moved to Zhenjiang. However, before 1911, the governor-general of Liangjiang moved the rice market to Wuhu at the request of private individuals, causing Zhenjiang's commerce to decline drastically. According to statistics, the annual sales volume of the Wuhu rice market reached over ten million shi at its peak, and at least five to six million shi. In addition to the regular taxes, there are also special taxes established in the city. If calculated at 50 cents per shi, the annual income is quite substantial. If the Zhenjiang rice market's sales volume is estimated at five million shi, with 50 cents per shi, the income can be 2.2 million yuan, which can be used to enrich provincial and county revenue. A portion can be used as a disaster relief fund for the county and a special disaster relief fund for the province, while another portion can be used to assist in the construction expenses of the provincial capital. This would both expand national plans and regulate people's livelihoods, stabilize the capital region, and consolidate the provincial capital.</p>

<p>Twelve Hostages from Xinhuang Town Escape Danger</p>
<p>In the major robbery case in Xinhuang Town, sixteen people were kidnapped, including two nephews of the wealthy Zhou Ailu. Two people have been released for 5,000 yuan. Two others escaped on their own by taking advantage of the relaxed guard. There are still twelve hostages, including a Mr. Jiang who runs a rice store. The initial ransom demand was 20,000 yuan, but as the military search became more strict, the price gradually dropped to 4,000 yuan. The next day, it dropped to 2,000 yuan, but it had to be paid within two days. The twelve hostages collected 2,000 yuan and were ready to hand it over the next day. Unexpectedly, due to the strict military search, the bandits all fled the night before, leaving no one to guard them. The hostages were able to walk out calmly. Therefore, the 2,000 yuan collected by Mr. Jiang and others was not delivered. They immediately prepared several white pigs, several jars of fine wine, and ten silver shields to reward the troops and sent them to the battalion headquarters. The battalion commander Qian refused to accept them, but after repeated persuasion, he finally accepted them. Yesterday, Mr. Jiang and others returned to their hometown of Xinhuang one after another. Relatives and friends came to inquire. Mr. Jiang, regaining his composure, described the situation in the bandit den in detail. According to him, the leader was indeed Taibao A Shu. The price negotiations were conducted by someone else. He was very strong. The previous claim that he was addicted to opium and thin was inaccurate. His hat was purchased from Shanghai at a price of 360 yuan. On the day of the escape, he changed all his clothes and disguised himself as a threadbare, unkempt peasant. The three female bandits arrested at Liujia Yan a dozen days ago initially refused to confess and were almost missed. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were one wife, one concubine, and one sister-in-law of Taibao A Shu Xu Tianxiong. It was also said that the families providing shelter were not all colluding with the bandits. The bandits forced them to provide shelter, changing houses every three days and hiding in an iron mill every two days. Whether they were willing or not, they had to provide shelter. The farmers were all afraid of them like tigers and dared not disobey. The families also had to provide food and lodging. Those who were slightly better off provided three meals of dry rice, while the poorest provided three meals of thin porridge. However, the guards were sent by Taibao A Shu himself. In view of this, the time to capture him should not be far off.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Confirmed News of the Northeast Paper Mill <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲ Situation As Spoken by Preparatory Office Director Jin Han</p>
<p>Jin Han, the director of the Northeast Paper Mill Preparatory Office, recently came to Shanghai from Shenyang. The reporter visited his residence yesterday and learned more details about the preparation of the factory. The following is a summary of what he said to inform the readers. The Northeast Paper Mill was advocated by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang, who, despite being very busy with government affairs, also pays great attention to industry. Recently, in view of the excellent forests in the eastern provinces and the urgent need for paper, he deeply desires to establish a state-of-the-art paper mill to recover economic rights and benefit culture. Therefore, last spring, he invited Mr. Jin to go north to investigate suitable locations for establishing a newspaper mill. Later, Mr. Jin, together with Mr. Zhao Jinglong, went to the upper reaches of the Songhua River for investigation and selected Pizhou in Liangdian County, Jilin, as the site of the paper mill, and the Lao'e River, 20 miles away, as the site of the hydroelectric power plant. The area is rich in timber, which is suitable for manufacturing newsprint. The terrain and water volume are suitable for building a dam to generate electricity, and transportation is convenient due to the completion of the Shenhai Railway a year ago. In addition, clear water and minerals such as coal, sulfur, and limestone are all available. After Mr. Jin and others reported, Mr. Zhang was satisfied and decided to raise huge funds to build a state-of-the-art, perfect newsprint mill, adopting the methods of large-scale and highly efficient newsprint mills in the West to manufacture newsprint. In early October, a preparatory office was established outside the Dabeibian Gate on Central Road in Shenyang, with Mr. Zhang Zhiliang appointed as the director, Mr. Jin as the director, and Mr. Zhao as the deputy director. Together, they discussed methods and actively proceeded. Surveying engineers were borrowed from the North China Water Conservancy Commission in Tianjin, and rock drilling workers were borrowed from the Jinkou Coal Mine Company, and they went to Pizhou Lao'e River to measure the paper mill and dam base and hydrology, and to drill and test the rocks at the bottom of the river. The measurement has been completed, and the rock drilling is still in progress. Once all the preliminary work is completed, preparations will be made to purchase machinery. The factory has many advantages and will definitely be profitable. The capital required is very large, and all parties are welcome to invest. The smoothness of the progress this time is largely due to the support of the local people, with Wang Shuhan, Wu Jiaxiang, Qian Jechen, Peng Jiqun, and others being particularly helpful. Zhang Zhiliang is a major industrialist in Liaoning and once served as the chairman of the Fengtian General Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. He is currently the general manager of the Shenhai Railway Company. Mr. Jin specialized in papermaking at the papermaking department of the University of Maine in the United States and received a master's degree. He also served as an intern technician at the Great Northern Paper Company and the Conserved Pulpwood Company in the United States for more than four years. After returning to China, he served as a technician at the Guangxi Construction Department and an investigator specially appointed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, handling the investigation of forest water resources and the design of paper mills. Mr. Zhao graduated from the Department of Applied Chemistry of Osaka Higher Industrial School in Japan and interned at a Japanese paper mill for more than a year. The three men are knowledgeable and experienced, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang is very enthusiastic in presiding over the project, so the future is full of hope.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Cotton Mill Federation Telegraphs to Cancel Hebei Cotton Tax <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The China Cotton Mill Federation telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry a few days ago, stating: "The president of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Industry: Previously, the Tianjin Cotton Mill Association telegraphed that after Hebei levied a unified tax on cotton yarn, the tax on cotton was still levied as usual. After receiving the telegram from the affiliated association, it believed that Hebei was still levying cotton yarn after the abolition of the likin tax, which was illegal. It telegraphed your ministry to stop it or issue the refund from the unified tax on cotton yarn. Later, Dong Dai replied in a telegram that the regulations on the unified tax on cotton yarn did not provide for the refund of the cotton tax. Upon receiving this, we were extremely puzzled. The focus of this case is whether the cotton tax in Hebei should be levied or not, not whether the cotton yarn should be refunded. If it is said that the regulations on the unified tax on cotton yarn do not provide for the refund of the cotton tax, and the illegal cotton tax in Hebei is completely ignored, it is one thing to abolish the likin tax, and another to tacitly approve Hebei's disguised likin tax, and yet another to collect a unified tax on cotton yarn in the name of compensating for the abolition of the likin tax. If the government is to show the country its good faith, it would not contradict itself to this extent. We urge you to quickly telegram the Hebei Provincial Government to cancel the cotton tax likin as soon as possible in order to preserve credibility and relieve the difficulties of merchants. We await your urgent order, China Cotton Mill Federation."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Requests from Various Industries for Exemption or Reduction of Business Tax <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>▲ Textile Industry The Shanghai Textile Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: “Regarding the Ministry of Finance’s promulgation of the Outline for the Collection of Business Tax: Business tax is a local revenue source, as stated in Article 1; provinces should determine tax rates based on local commercial conditions, as stated in Article 2; and all taxes of the same nature should be abolished, as stated in Article 7. Our textile industry was instructed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on June 22nd of the 17th year of the Republic of China to follow the National Government’s resolution that handmade textiles, being a major domestic product, should be exempt from tax and levies according to the precedent of the 7th year of the Republic, based on six standard rules, to promote sales and maintain the livelihoods of the poor who are both producers and consumers. This instruction is on file. Before the abolition of levies, the government had no such revenue. Now that taxes and levies have been abolished, there seems to be no need to compensate for the textile industry. While handmade textiles do not entirely align with the principle of non-profit, it is necessary to study and maintain their role in assisting the development of various local businesses. Historically, there were three industries that fundamentally benefited the people: (1) pawnshops, (2) rice businesses, and (3) handmade textiles. Exchanging cloth for money and money for grain enables farmers to have surplus grain and women to have surplus cloth. This is a request for people's livelihood from thousands of years of history. Cotton is spun into yarn, and yarn is made into cloth. Now, cotton is collected by factories, and yarn comes from factories, so the tax has already been levied at the source. The National Government recognizes this and stipulates that cotton yarn that has already paid the consolidated tax is not subject to double taxation when directly woven into goods (see Article 5 of the Consolidated Tax Regulations). Considering the government’s decade of effort in maintaining this, we naturally request exemption. From the perspective of the commercial people's burden, the textile industry benefits the people, and the loom operators are all poor, unable to support themselves and are on the verge of closing down. How can we console the late Premier's emphasis on people's livelihood, and how can we secure the livelihoods of tens of millions of poor people? Our association and the loom operators are interdependent. We are not crying wolf. We are concerned for the city and the countryside, hoping to preserve this lifeline and prevent foreign goods from flooding the market and regaining their dominance. We respectfully submit this letter explaining the reasons for exempting our industry's textiles to your esteemed association for review and submission to the authorities, requesting approval for exemption. We would be extremely grateful.”</p>
<p>▲ Lace Industry The Shanghai Lace and Embroidery Trade Association telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: “Our association's lace and embroidery industry has historically been exempt from customs duties and levies. We now request that it remain exempt from business tax in order to maintain the established precedent and align with the principle of encouraging foreign trade. We have appointed Yi Deng and others, elected at the public meeting on February 20th, as representatives to submit petitions to your esteemed committees, yuan, and ministries, requesting approval to issue a nationwide order to exempt lace and embroidery from business tax. We are immensely grateful that your esteemed committees, yuan, and ministries have agreed to adopt our request. We should await the official reply in silence and dare not make further statements. However, there are still omissions in the four reasons listed in the original petition. Therefore, we specifically submit four additional reasons by telegram for your kind consideration. The term 'lace' in the market actually distinguishes between the lace industry and the lace embroidery industry. When our association submitted the petition in Nanjing, we submitted samples of tablecloths, placemats, and handkerchiefs produced by our members. Some are made with sand yarn, and others have embroidered patterns surrounded by lace. These are customarily referred to as lace, but they are actually household necessities such as large and small tablecloths, dining table cloths, hand towels, piano covers, chair cushions, placemats, and pillowcases. To simplify identification, our members named it lace embroidery. At the same time, we also submitted three samples of foreign-made lace used to decorate women's clothing. The representatives explained the differences in person, and all were accepted for review. We believe that your esteemed committees, yuan, and ministries, with your keen insight, will be able to understand the details. However, lace is a product manufactured overseas and sold in China, while lace embroidery involves our members receiving orders for fabric from foreign merchants and distributing it to poor women for needlework before delivering it to foreign merchants. The nature is completely different. Considering the government's historical policy of exempting taxes and levies to promote development, and following the common practice of modern countries in protecting tariffs, the lace embroidery industry should not be subject to business tax. This is the first reason for requesting a clear exemption. The business tax regulations promulgated by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments only list lace in the schedule of taxable goods in the commodity sales industry, with a tax rate of 20 per mille. Lace embroidery does not have a clearly defined tax rate. The intention behind this may be to encourage and promote the development of domestic handicrafts that only trade with foreign countries. However, since lace and lace embroidery are both commonly referred to as lace in the market, if there is no clear distinction at this time, we fear that the confusion in names may lead to misunderstandings when collecting taxes in the future. This is the second reason for requesting a clear exemption. Some argue that business tax is a direct tax, and unless otherwise stipulated in Article 1 of the Outline Supplementary Measures, all businesses should fulfill their obligation to pay taxes. The lace embroidery industry's request for exemption seems to lack a legal basis. If the government authorities approve this request, other industries will follow suit, making it difficult to handle. However, those who say this have not fully considered the matter. All industries used to have customs duties and levies, so business tax must be collected to compensate for this. However, the lace embroidery industry has not had any levies for over 40 years, so there is no loss from the abolition of levies, and there is no need to consider compensation. The argument of following suit is an overconcern. Even if it is said that the textile industry, which was also exempt from taxes and levies, must now pay business tax, lace embroidery seems to be an exception. However, their natures are not entirely the same. Lace embroidery involves receiving orders for fabric from foreign merchants, having it made by women's handicrafts, and then selling it overseas without any domestic sales. In reality, our members only earn a small commission from foreign merchants to make a living, and poor women rely on this to survive. Although the textile industry is also a handicraft, its products are mostly sold in various parts of the country. The situations are so different that there is no basis for following suit. This is the third reason for requesting a clear exemption. The central government's determination to abolish levies is intended to promote the development of domestic industries and to seek the prosperity of domestic commerce. However, since levies are a major source of tax revenue for our country, it is inevitable that alternative ways to compensate for the loss must be found during this time when the national treasury is strained. The business tax is intended to compensate for local losses from the abolition of levies, which is also a reluctant measure. The lace embroidery industry was supported and encouraged by the government during the era of harsh levies, with exemptions from customs duties and levies. Now that levies have been abolished nationwide and industries are celebrating their recovery, it would be contrary to the central government's intention to abolish levies and the government's desire to benefit businesses and people if the lace embroidery industry were subjected to business tax. Furthermore, the lace embroidery industry is already affected by the decline in foreign markets and is under pressure from government-subsidized competition from countries such as Portugal and Japan. It is impossible for businesses to bear this burden. This is the fourth reason for requesting a clear exemption.” (Xia Yu)</p>
<p>▲ Tea and Snack Industry The Tea and Snack Industry Association sent a letter to the Tax Regulations Research Committee of various industry associations, stating: “Regarding the business tax regulations promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, our association is included in the highest tax bracket, with a tax rate of 20 per mille, which is more than ten times higher than the rate set by the Ministry. The merchants are all extremely alarmed. The establishment of our stores has always been characterized by small-scale operations with small capital and minor business. The products sold are mostly pastries and cakes, without wholesale business. All sales are retail, and the operating profit is meager, like flies' heads. We have always had a poor profession. In prosperous years, we can still make a living, but in years of commercial depression, we cannot even cover our expenses. Furthermore, the raw materials used, such as sugar, oil, rice, and flour, have already been taxed when purchased. If we are taxed again at such a high rate after processing them into finished products, it is not only beyond our ability but also lacks legal basis. The reasons for requesting a lower rate are as follows: (1) Tea and snacks are actually intended to facilitate travel or to meet the needs of morning meals at home. Taxing them at 20 per mille, on par with luxury goods, is not fair. (2) The sales channels are narrow, and the transaction value is only a few cents to a few dimes, never exceeding a few dollars. The tax rate for the sundries industry is only 5 per mille. Comparing the two, a rate of 1 per mille would be more appropriate to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. (3) Tea and snack stores, in addition to homemade pastries which should be taxed, also sell side items such as pickled vegetables, canned goods, and candies. When the tea and snack industry accepts these items from other industries, they have already been taxed and paid within the purchase price. If the tea and snack industry is taxed again when selling them, it is no different from taxing the same item twice, which is almost double taxation. (4) The resolution of the Five Provinces' Abolition of Levies Conference states that silk taxes should be refunded for silk thread taxes, and silk thread taxes should be refunded for cocoon taxes, in order to avoid double taxation. The items sold by the tea and snack industry have one item that combines three taxes (consolidated tax, special tax, and factory tax), which is too numerous to list. They should not be taxed at the highest business tax rate. (5) The provincial government's business tax regulations tax the snack industry at only 2 per mille. The difference in tax rates is more than ten times, which is a large discrepancy and inconsistent with the Ministry's Outline of Business Tax Regulations. Based on the above five points, our industry's commercial activity is minor, and the market is depressed. In terms of the situation, we are unable to bear the tax burden. Considering that citizens should contribute to government expenses, but compared with the tax rates of the rice, salt, sundries, and snack industries, this is unfair. Even in terms of taxation, we should follow the Ministry's Outline of Business Tax Regulations and deliberate on the matter. Since our city has no loss from the abolition of levies, this business tax should be postponed to alleviate the people's difficulties and revitalize commerce. If it is necessary to implement it, foreign and Chinese stores should be treated equally. Our association is deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit our difficulties to your esteemed association, requesting you to forward them to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government for reconsideration to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We would be truly grateful.” (Below omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Xin Chang Shipowner Requests Maritime Trial <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>▲ Central Cabin Ruptured, Water Submerged Deck</p>
<p>Inspect Bottom First Before Salvage</p>
<p>▲ Shipowner Returns to Shanghai The news that the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Chang ship ran aground near Ma'anshan and that the crew and sailors were rescued by the Bureau's dispatched ship has already been reported in this newspaper. The Xin Chang shipowner, Mr. Sha Deng, along with the chief mate, second mate, chief engineer, and steward, waited for the chief shipowner, Mr. Mackner, to arrive and inspect the ship. Therefore, they were the last to leave the ship. Sha Deng and the other four left the ship at 3:00 AM on the 7th, boarded the Lijin warship, and returned to the Xin Chang ship with the chief shipowner on the 8th. At 11:00 AM, they boarded the Xuepu Sun barge and returned to Shanghai at around 7:00 PM that night. Yesterday, Sha Deng and the chief mate, Zhao Shimei, went to the Bureau to report the details of the Xin Chang accident to the General Manager, saying that this disaster was caused by unavoidable natural disasters. They reported in detail the moment the ship encountered fog and waves that drove it into the hidden reef, confirming that it was an irresistible maritime disaster. They then went to the Shipping Department to discuss the salvage plan with Chief Huang, where a precise consultation was held.</p>
<p>▲ Arbitrating Responsibility The shipowner and chief mate were on duty together when the Xin Chang ran aground. Now, in order to clarify the responsibility for this accident, Mr. Sha Deng has submitted a request to the Bureau, requesting the Jianghai Customs Marine Survey Department and another maritime expert to organize a maritime court to hear the case in order to prove that it was indeed a natural disaster and not the fault of the shipowner or crew. General Manager Li will comply with Sha Deng's request and submit the issue of responsibility to trial to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Requests The crew and sailors who arrived in Shanghai yesterday sent representatives to the Bureau to request compensation for losses. General Manager Li sent Mr. Zhu to receive and comfort them, promising to retain the positions of all employees, give priority to arranging employment, and provide each employee with 40 yuan to assist with their losses. The drowned mess boy, Mr. Dong, will be given a pension by the Bureau. The eight crew members who took a fishing boat to Ningbo are expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>▲ Suggestion of Salvage When the shipowner and others last left the Xin Chang, the ship was sinking into the water because the first two cabins were ruptured and the engine room was flooded. The seawater submerged the deck. Yesterday, the Shanghai agent of the Japan Tokyo Salvage Company sent personnel to the Bureau to discuss salvage procedures. The Bureau needs to examine this matter further. It was agreed yesterday to first borrow technicians and divers from the Jiangnan Shipyard to go to the scene of the accident and inspect the bottom of the Xin Chang before discussing salvage procedures. The technicians will depart today.</p>
<p>▲ Requesting Warship Protection The Haijun Yuzhang warship has not yet reported, but four fishing boats have already boarded the ship after the crew left and looted the ship's contents, including the crew and sailors' luggage, clothes, money, and sundries. When the chief crew arrived at the ship for inspection, everything had already been taken away. Yesterday, the Bureau urgently telegraphed the Xiamen Navy, requesting them to send marines to protect the ship to prevent pirates from damaging machinery and screws.</p>
<p>▲ Comprador Loss The comprador, Sheng Wunian, previously lost over 1,000 taels of gold on the ship while transporting a group of people from Guangdong and Guangxi. Afterward, his request for compensation was approved by the Beijing authorities but has not yet been issued. Now that the ship has been wrecked, the comprador's losses are also significant. He has placed the personnel of the cargo handling department under the Bureau's control.</p>
<p>▲ Hong Kong Service Suspended The Xin Chang was the best ship of the China Merchants Bureau and could travel to Hong Kong and carry passengers. Now that it has been wrecked, although the Bureau has many ships, none can be used for the Hong Kong route. Therefore, the Shanghai-Hong Kong route will be temporarily suspended. It is said that General Manager Li is already considering this.</p>

<p>▲ Still Pushing Wang Xu and Two Representatives to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>The Special Relief Committee for the Silk Industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a plenary committee discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM because the representatives who went to Beijing regarding the silk industry public bonds had returned to Shanghai. More than ten people attended, chaired by Shen Huachen. After performing the formalities, the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting. Wang Xiaolai, one of the representatives who went to Beijing, reported on the situation in Beijing, saying that they had successively visited Chairman Zhuang and the Ministers of Finance and Industry, and hosted banquets for the members of the Legislative Yuan. The results of the petition were quite satisfactory, and all agreed to reconsider. Next, Representative Chu Ziseng reported on the reason for the reduction in the amount issued. Minister Kong said that when the public bonds were requested, the price of middle-grade silk was only 800 taels. Subsequently, Director Zou of the Commodity Inspection Bureau reported that the price of silk had risen to 1,070 to 80 taels, and the silk factory industry did not need huge relief funds, so it was changed to encourage exports, improve locomotives, and improve sericulture, each issuing 2 million yuan. However, the good silk price lasted less than a week and returned to around 1,000 taels. The factory's capital still needs to be net 1,000 taels less. Adding the cost of reeling labor and interest, the total cost of middle-grade silk is 1,300 taels. Selling at market price, the factory needs to lose 200 to 300 taels. Furthermore, most silk factories in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are still closed. The factories that are open are all borrowing from the financial sector to start machines. Because of the mortgage relationship, waiting for relief is extremely urgent. Next, Committee Member Wu said that the government may have misunderstood the locomotive improvement section. Most manufacturers everywhere rent car reeling silk, accounting for 90%. Improving locomotives should be the responsibility of the factory owner, not the manufacturer. The word "reward" is inversely proportional to the word "relief." Rewards do not require clearing debt principal and interest. Now, the silk industry public bonds must require manufacturers to clear debt principal and interest separately, which is purely a relief nature. The word "reward" is not applicable and should be corrected. Finally, the committee members repeatedly discussed that there are about 50,000 silk cars in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The factories are closed, waiting for relief, and they are all in a hurry. 4 million yuan is not enough to distribute. It was decided that Wang Xu and two representatives should still be pushed to take a train to Beijing on the same day to present to the National Government, maintain the original plan, issue public bonds of 8 million yuan, use 2 million yuan to improve prudent medicine, and use 6 million yuan to relieve the silk factory industry. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>▲ Jufeng Ship Plans to Sell and Suspend Service</p>
<p>▲ Xin Renhe Also Joins Service</p>
<p>▲ Conference and Joint Management The six Congsha shift companies have been competing too fiercely, and their losses last year were quite large. This year, Da Xing, Xu Zhongxin, and others initiated the establishment of an alliance and cooperation, following the example of the Ningbo and Taizhou routes. Representatives from the six companies held a meeting at the Shipping Industry Association and unanimously agreed to cooperate. They then discussed the joint management conditions, and Liu Bingsheng, the representative of Jufeng Company, proposed to withdraw the Haimen ship from the route.</p>
<p>▲ Purchase Haimen Jufeng Company had long planned to abandon the Congsha line and switch to another route. This matter was mentioned last year. The other five companies on the line planned to accept the company's ships, so they discussed the matter. According to the five companies' proposal, the Jufeng Company's Haimen ship would be jointly purchased by the five companies, and the ship price would be bought at the 36,000 yuan set last year. Liu Bingsheng said that the ship price issue requires a slight request from the shareholders for consent before a decision can be made. It was heard yesterday that the Jufeng shareholders believe that the price is too short, so they are still in negotiation.</p>
<p>▲ Organize Association Congsha joint management has been agreed by Da Xing, Da Da, Ping An, Xin Xing Long, and others to organize an association. Each company sends staff to join the association to handle affairs, and the Congsha shift ships are completely handed over to the association for management. All matters such as dispatching shifts, freight rates, and cabin positions are subject to the full discretion of the association. The number of ships leaving port each day is reduced from four to two. Once the purchase of the Haimen ship is resolved, it will be implemented. At that time, passenger feet will still return to their original state. The five companies are currently in the process of preparing.</p>
<p>▲ Renhe Joins The Xin Renhe ship also operates on the Congsha shift. In order to improve the ship and increase cabin space, the company had the ship repaired in the shipyard and renovated it. Once it is completely completed, it will join the association and travel on the Congsha route with the six companies. Yesterday, the reporter met someone in the association and inquired about the situation. According to reports, it can be established and implemented in cooperation within half a month at the latest.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Measures of the Social Bureau to Ban Various Savings Stores <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲ Appoint Accountants to Investigate and Report</p>
<p>▲ Yonghua and Lihua are also in the process of banning</p>
<p>The Social Bureau, according to the order transferred by the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Finance to ban ordinary companies and shops from operating savings, has previously ordered various companies and shops to end and report within one month, the details of which have been reported in this newspaper many times. It is now heard that after the companies and shops were ordered, they are all willing to end the savings department in accordance with the order, but the methods of proceeding are different. For example, Yong'an branch is reorganizing the bank, Sincere Company has changed the savings accounts to deposit accounts or current accounts, and China Underwear Weaving Factory has set a period to send away savings, but only the Sino-Western Sino-French Women's Virtue Savings Association jointly organized by the two families has not yet reported the closing method. It is now heard that the Social Bureau believes that the methods of various savings companies and shops are very inconsistent, so they have ordered them as follows: (1) Order to stop collecting money immediately. (2) Ordinary shops that do not use the name of savings for deposits may be temporarily exempt from banning, but they still need to ask the central government for instructions. (3) Demand deposits must be sent away to each depositor within one month. (4) Time deposit methods are divided into two categories: A. If the depositor voluntarily withdraws money within one month, they should be allowed to change the interest to current account calculation in accordance with bank practice, and send away the deposit. B. If the depositor does not withdraw, the total amount should be transferred to a bank approved to handle savings, otherwise a considerable guarantee must be provided to the Central Bank to temporarily wait for the central government to approve. (5) Entrust an accountant to check the total amount of various savings deposits, business conditions, and asset and liability status of each company and shop within one week, and report for approval. The above-mentioned methods of decision have been reported to the municipal government for record.</p>
<p>Also, Yonghua Company on Fada Road, Lihua Company on Paobou Road, and Jiufu Company on Baker Road, which usually operate savings, have also been ordered to close within one month.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Minutes of the Pushan Villa Board Meeting <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲No matter how difficult</p>
<p>▲We must strive to proceed</p>
<p>The Pushan Villa of Zhabei held a board meeting at its general office at No. 2, Sixth Avenue yesterday at 4:00 PM. Board members Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Lu Weiyong, Shen Xiechen, Shi Gengyin, Chen Liangyu, and Wang Junsheng were present. Chairman Wang Yiting opened the meeting as usual, followed by a report from Director Wang Junsheng on the various charitable deeds carried out in the 19th year. A total of 36,130 large and small coffins were received and buried by the Villa, 12,965 large and small coffins were given out, and 52,216 medical consultations and medicines were provided by the hospital. However, in recent years, the area has become vast, the exposure to the elements has increased, materials and labor are expensive, and expenses are high. It is estimated that the budget for this year's expenses will be far from sufficient. Huang Hanzhi then stated that the charitable deeds carried out by the Villa are painstakingly and meticulously done, leaving no effort unspared, and are beneficial to the public health and the diseases of the poor. No matter how exhausted the funds or how difficult the operation, efforts must be made to proceed and find ways to raise funds to ensure sustainability. Everyone agreed and resolved that the directors and members of the Villa, who have always been charitable and enthusiastic about helping others, should discuss the financial difficulties and solicit generous donations to maintain the charitable cause. The remaining proposals were approved unanimously. The meeting adjourned, and the clock struck seven.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Emergency Meeting of the Sanbei Native Association <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲Yu Qiaqing telegraphed to request an investigation of County Magistrate Miao</p>
<p>The Sanbei Native Association in Shanghai, yesterday, regarding the case of Yuyao County Magistrate Miao colluding with the notorious local tyrant Yu Shoutang of the county to exploit the villagers, convened an emergency meeting at its association hall on Ningbo Road. Those present included the association president Yu Zhiqing, directors Chen Liangyu, Hu Diansun, Shen Weiting, Fan Bangyu, Hong Xuefan, and more than 30 others. Yu Lianqing, a representative of the farmers of Yuyao, reported on the details of the case, and Yu Jinhe detailed the unjustified detention of the victims Luo Afu and others in the county court, and the various crimes of Yu Shoutang in oppressing the farmers in the countryside. The chairman of the association, Yu Zhiqing, and the entire committee, resolved that the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai should send a telegram to Chairman Zhang of Zhejiang Province, requesting that he forward it to the Department of Civil Affairs, to promptly release the innocent detained people, and to investigate and punish County Magistrate Miao, who builds laws to harm the people, and the notorious local tyrant Yu Shoutang, according to the law. The original telegram is as follows: To Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The former County Magistrate Miao of Yuyao, biased and believing in local ruffians such as Yu Shoutang, presented an extra levy of land reports. Villagers of the county, Luo Afu, Yu Tang, Yu Fang, Yu Xiaohong, and others, filed a lawsuit with the Ningbo Court. Later, Yu Shoutang sought mediation from the Sanbei Native Association in Shanghai, while at the same time requesting the Ningbo Court to dismiss the case. After returning to his hometown, he directly filed a counterclaim with the Yuyao County Court, accusing Luo Fu and others of false accusations. The former County Magistrate, without asking for the facts, detained Luo Afu and others and did not allow bail. Yu Shoutang and the former County Magistrate were in cahoots and acted arbitrarily in the countryside, exploiting the villagers. Luo Afu and others are indeed purely engaged in farming. How could the former County Magistrate have so lightly listened to his words, causing Luo and others to be unjustly wronged? Therefore, we respectfully request that you investigate and order the Department of Civil Affairs to promptly investigate and handle the matter, so that the aggrieved may be cleared, and request that the four detainees be released quickly and restored to freedom. Respectfully, Yu Hede of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Continued Trial of the Inducement and Adultery Case of the Young Owner of a Sock Factory <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>▲Where did Shen Meimei's son come from?</p>
<p>▲Zhong Xiaoqi is still trying to deny it</p>
<p>▲Sentencing scheduled for next Monday</p>
<p>Zhong Xiaoqi, the young owner of a Guangdong sock factory, had an intimate relationship with his neighbor Shen Meimei in September two years ago, and they had a close relationship and secretly made a lifelong commitment. When Shen Meimei became pregnant and gave birth to a child, she was abandoned by Zhong. Shen's mother, Shen Li, hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to sue Zhong for inducement and adultery in the Special District Local Court. The court has heard the case several times, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was held again. Judge Xiao Xiefen opened the Fifth Court to summon both plaintiffs and defendants and their representatives, who arrived on time to await the hearing. The details of the trial are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Prostitute arrives in court and then withdraws Judge Xiao had not yet begun the questioning when the defendant's lawyer, Ye Dikang, first stated that of the witnesses summoned by the court, the prostitutes Ai Yue and Qing Feng, only Qing Feng had arrived today, but soon disappeared again, perhaps at the instigation of the plaintiffs. Zhong Xiaoqi also added that it was lawyer Shen who ordered her to go back. Lawyer Shen replied that his firm did not know Qing Feng and that the plaintiff's lawyer could not order the defendant's witnesses to go anywhere. Opening rooms mostly during the day Judge Xiao then questioned Shen Meimei, asking when she came to Shanghai. Shen replied that she had been in Shanghai for seven or eight years. He asked who she lived with in Shanghai. She replied that she lived with her mother and sister-in-law. After marrying her sister-in-law, her mother returned to Suzhou. He asked when her sister-in-law died and when her mother came to Shanghai. She replied that her sister-in-law died in October last year and her mother came in September. He asked if she and Zhong Xiaoqi opened rooms or borrowed houses. She replied that they opened rooms and never borrowed houses. He asked if they opened rooms during the day or at night. She replied that it was during the day, and she was always at home at night. He asked how many times they opened rooms in total. She replied that he often asked her to go, and she couldn't remember how many times. He asked when it started. She replied that it started on September 23 of the year before last. He asked if her mother was in Shanghai at the time. She replied that she was in Suzhou. She said she came back to Shanghai for a funeral. He asked when her mother found out. She replied that she only found out in September last year.</p>
<p>▲Pu Laosi submits a statement as a witness At this point, Judge Xiao asked if the witnesses had arrived. A Chinese constable No. 1281 reported that he had been ordered to summon the two prostitutes Ai Yue and Qing Feng. The first time he went to summon them, both prostitutes refused to accept the summons. The second time he went to summon them, they both accepted, but he didn't know if they had arrived today. Lawyer Shen immediately said that Ai Yue's mother had arrived. Judge Xiao then summoned Ai Yue's mother, Pu Laosi, for questioning. Pu Laosi stated that she was 39 years old, the mother of Ai Yue, and the owner of the brothel, currently residing in Minhe Lane. Judge Xiao instructed her to tell the truth when testifying in court, otherwise she would be punished. He then ordered Pu Laosi to sign a statement, pointed at Shen Meimei, and asked if Pu Laosi knew her. Pu replied that she did not know her. He asked if she had ever done business at her place. She replied that her family was all her own people and there were no outsiders, so she didn't know this person.</p>
<p>▲Shen Meimei cries for fourteen days Judge Xiao then asked Shen Meimei's mother, Shen Li, when she married her daughter-in-law. She replied that she married her daughter-in-law on April 19 last year. He asked if she was often in Shanghai before marrying her daughter-in-law. She replied that she was often in Shanghai, but after marrying her daughter-in-law, she often returned to Changzhou. He asked if she knew that her daughter and Zhong Xiaoqi opened a room on September 23 of the year before last. She replied that she was often sick at the time, and when her daughter went out during the day, she always excused herself by saying that she was going to Huajin Lane to buy goods, and she never stayed out at night, so she didn't pay attention and didn't know. He asked when she found out later. She replied that in October last year, she came to Shanghai from Suzhou and saw that her daughter was pregnant. After asking, she said that it was the young owner next door who was the father, and that the young owner had expressed his willingness to marry her daughter. Later, she was abandoned by the young owner and did not care for her. Therefore, when her daughter gave birth at Guangren Hospital, she cried for fourteen days and became seriously ill, so much so that she has not yet recovered. Even today, when going upstairs to await the hearing, she needs two people to support her.</p>
<p>▲Zhong Xiaoqi's denial Judge Xiao turned to Zhong Xiaoqi and asked if he opened a room with Shen Meimei during the day or at night. He replied that it was both day and night, but he only stayed overnight once, and her mother knew about it. Her mother also said to him that opening rooms outside was too uneconomical and asked him to live in her house to save money. Her family runs a club, so he can play cards and smoke. Her mother has also lived in Shanghai for a long time, and her mother buys the groceries every day. The court doesn't believe it, you can investigate in the alley and you will understand. At this point, Lawyer Shen, with the permission of Judge Xiao, asked Zhong if Shen Meimei's child was his. Zhong replied that it was not his. She is a prostitute and has many customers, so of course he doesn't know who the father is. He also asked that, since it was not his child, why did he send her to Guangren Hospital? Zhong replied that he did not send her. Lawyer Shen immediately stated to the court that his firm had entrusted Lawyer Yang to send a letter to Guangren Hospital to inquire whether there was a woman named Zhong who came to the hospital to give birth. He now has a reply from the hospital, stating that a woman named Zhong did come to the hospital to give birth and was sent by a Guangdong sock factory. He then presented the reply to the court. Then he questioned Zhong Xiaoqi again, asking what he meant by the sentence in the letter he wrote to Shen Meimei, "I harmed you for life in the past, and I will repay you in the future, and I cannot forgive you even in death." Zhong said he did not want to answer. Lawyer Shen then said to Zhong, you must tell the truth. Zhong replied that if he told the truth, Shen Meimei would not have sued him in court. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Ye Dikang, stated that the photo of Shen and Zhong taken together that was published in the newspaper a few days ago was created by the plaintiff by pasting her own photo with Zhong's photo, because the defendant had never taken a photo with the plaintiff.</p>
<p>▲Closing arguments and sentencing scheduled Judge Xiao ordered the closing arguments to begin. After mutual vigorous arguments by lawyers Shen and Ye, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on Monday of next week. He then asked Zhong Xiaoqi if he had anything to say. Zhong replied that Shen Meimei was indeed a prostitute and asked the court to investigate thoroughly so that it would be clear. If the investigation showed that she was not a prostitute, he would willingly be punished twice as much. After giving his statement, he left the court.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Inside Story of the Qing Death Case in the Moon Palace is Revealed <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>▲The man and woman were indeed employees of the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>▲Autopsy and photos taken of the bodies</p>
<p>The Qing death case at the Chunyun Daxuan Moon Palace Restaurant came to an end yesterday. The so-called Ma Yusun and Bian Juefei's bodies have all been inspected by the court, "photographed, and placed in coffins," becoming the finale of this case. However, the real names of the man and woman and their past lives were also revealed at this time, perhaps beyond the expectations of this pair of lovers who "persevered in love." The deceased woman's original name was Bai Beichen, and the man's name was Tang Xing. Both were employees of the Ministry of Communications in the capital. The five love letters recorded in yesterday's newspaper, the one signed "Chen Sheng" was actually written by Bai, and the unsigned ones were written by Tang. Bai and Tang both worked in the library of the Ministry of Communications. Bai was 27 years old, from Beijing, and already married with two children, which is what yesterday's letter referred to as "two pieces of wronged offspring." After being with Tang for a long time, their friendship developed into a romantic relationship. Unfortunately, good things are hard to come by, and it was difficult to stay together for life. Both had the idea of suicide. Tang even resigned from his job to show his determination. On the morning of the 2nd, the two eloped together and appeared in Shanghai the next day. As for what happened later, the reports from the past two days can be reviewed and will not be repeated.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Reducing the Price to Sell a Daughter is Strange <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲Uncle and nephew don't know each other</p>
<p>▲Is there any doubt about trafficking in human beings?</p>
<p>Pu Mingyuan, a 40-year-old man from Nanjing, has been running a Pu Hengtai tooth sign shop at No. 6 Jianyuli, South Street, Hai Chao Temple, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a man resembling a worker brought a girl to Pu's shop, saying that if anyone wanted the young girl, they only needed to pay 160 yuan. Pu said he didn't want her. Then the man suddenly lowered the price to 100 yuan. Pu thought that the sale of the young girl must be of unknown origin and suspicious, so he told him to wait a moment and secretly went out to call the watchman police officer Wu Yanyi of the 26th post to come and arrest him, and took the young girl to the 1st District, 3rd Precinct. During the preliminary interrogation, Chief Jin asked the man, who gave his name as Wu Zhicheng, 30 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, who made a living by pulling a rickshaw and currently lived at No. 7, Lane 3, Yanpingli, Jiaxing Road, Nanshi. He said that his brother Zhifu's wife, Xu, gave birth to a daughter (the young girl Yang brought). Zhifu died many years ago. Because Xu had no way to make a living in the countryside, she took the girl to Shanghai to make a living. Unexpectedly, Xu suddenly eloped with someone a few days ago, leaving the girl unattended. He planned to take her back to his hometown, but he completely denied selling the girl. When asked, the young girl stated that her name was Si Yatou, she was nine years old, from Jiangbei, and her parents were both alive at home, and she also had a younger brother named Daqiuzi. She said that she did not know this man (referring to Wu). The chief thought that there was no reason why an uncle and nephew would not know each other, and it was clearly a case of trafficking in human beings. He ordered him to be detained for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Assassination of a Platoon Leader <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲The battalion commander is highly suspected</p>
<p>▲Tianjin will send detectives to escort him</p>
<p>Zhang Wanrong, the platoon leader of a certain military battalion commander Sun Dalong's unit, was assassinated in Tianjin on January 25 last year. The murderer fled the scene. However, Battalion Commander Sun also abandoned his post and fled after the incident. After investigation by Tianjin, it was believed that Sun was highly suspected. It was recently learned that he was residing at No. 941 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of Shanghai. The Tianjin authorities telegraphed Shanghai to request assistance in arresting Sun and punishing him. The Hongkou Police Department dispatched detective Liu Shijie to the French Concession to arrest Sun. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court. Because Tianjin had not yet sent anyone to Shanghai to escort him, Judge Feng Shide questioned Sun, who stated that Zhang Wanrong's behavior was despicable and he had many enemies. He really didn't know who killed him and was willing to go to Tianjin to confront him. The court then ordered the defendant to be detained temporarily and the hearing adjourned to a later date. It is reported that the police department has telegraphed Tianjin, and personnel will arrive in Shanghai to transfer him in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Yao Liankui is Daring <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>▲Forging an Order from the Supreme Court</p>
<p>▲Using a small wooden seal to create a square seal</p>
<p>▲Fraudulent under the name of a process server</p>
<p>▲Not repenting even after serving three years</p>
<p>Yao Liankui, also known as Yao Zhengkun, from Anhui, once impersonated a clerk of the Local Court and stole and sold the bricks and tiles of the court, and defrauded litigants of money. He was punished by the court for three years. After being released, he did not restrain himself and continued to swindle and deceive others.</p>
<p>Lu Zhang, a woman from the Laobaidu area of ​​Pudong, was detained due to her husband's debt case. Yao acted as her guarantor. In civil cases, no matter what, bail must be allowed, and there is no need to find a way. However, Yao deceived her because she was a woman and defrauded her of 52 yuan under the guise of a process server. The woman later inquired from the original process server, Mao Shukang, who said that there was no such thing. The woman told her to go to court to file a complaint. Yesterday morning, the woman brought Yao to the court, and the process servers on duty, Xu Qingxi and Zhai Jinwen, sent him to the prosecutor's office to report. Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Inspector Chen Xihui, based on Lu Zhang's claim that Yao had forged documents with him, ordered bailiff Li Jiajun and others to search out two forged official documents: (1) An order from the Supreme Court. The forged paper was a civil mediation document purchased from the Special District Court for five cents. A small wooden seal was used to create a square seal, with the words "Order Ma Daoyu to pay the litigation fee of 12 yuan and 5 cents in this case. Pay immediately and do not delay. This is important. Yu's share of the litigation fee in this case is nine-tenths. Pay immediately and do not resist. Those who violate this order will be punished. This order is for Ma Daoyu. January 28, Year 20. Appeal rejected. The appellant, Lu Yu, is informed. Judge Pang Zhen of the Supreme Court." (2) The paper was a report paper from the court, with the words "Shanghai Special District Local Court's application for reconsideration of a case, for reporting matters. Two documents, No. 130, Shangzi, Year 19. Received Ma Daoyu's fee for applying for reconsideration, 2 yuan and 55 cents. Judge Gong, Clerk's Seal." When asked about the seal, he also used a small wooden seal to cover more than ten times, forming a square seal. The handwriting was terrible and unprecedented. Moreover, the above-mentioned forged official documents can truly be said to be incomprehensible, making people laugh when reading them. It can only deceive illiterate rural fools. However, his boldness and recklessness are already evident.

<p>▲Learning to drive a car collides with a streetcar</p>
<p>▲Traffic was cut off for more than half an hour</p>
<p>At 5:45 PM yesterday, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Mercier in the French Concession, the French streetcar No. 24 on Route 2, operated by a French company, heading from the Bund to Xujiahui, was stopped to drop off passengers when a sedan-style car with Concession registration No. 206 and Chinese registration No. 6231 suddenly drove head-on. As it drove on the road, it swerved erratically. As it approached the streetcar, there was a loud crash, and the front of the streetcar was completely damaged, including the iron door and footboard. The passengers in the car were violently shaken, and many screamed. The car's engine and glass were also damaged. The driver of the car suffered a head injury. Afterwards, it was learned that the car belonged to a student of the Youxinkao Fu Advanced Automobile School at No. 12, Lane 125, Rue Gros. The student was practicing driving when the accident occurred due to inexperience. Streetcars coming from the east continued to arrive, totaling more than thirty, stopping on Avenue Joffre, as if holding a streetcar exhibition.

<h3 id="e107">Repercussions of the Installment Repayment Plan for the Riye Bank Case <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲The Social Affairs Bureau has rejected the plan based on the circumstances</p>
<p>The method for repaying debts of the Riye Bank and the Great World Savings Department in this city was proposed by Min Caizhang, the manager of the Great World, and submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for adoption and implementation. It has been reported in detail in this newspaper. It is now reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has rejected the plan based on the opposition of the debtors Diao Qianjin, Li Shenji, Li Shiji, and others. The reasons are roughly as follows: Most of the creditors are from the lower and middle classes of society, and all their meager savings are relied on for their current livelihood. If they are cunningly delayed in this way, it is feared that most of the creditors will be reduced to poverty within a year, and how can they survive? As for the various businesses of the Gongfa Company, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no changes in the recent business within a few years. How can they wait for thirty years? If this statement is implemented, it is tantamount to strangling the creditors to death. For the present plan, the existing assets of the Gongfa Company should be urgently disposed of as soon as possible. If the amount is insufficient, the sons of Chu Jiu and all the shareholders should be strictly ordered to bear unlimited liability. A quick and decisive approach should be taken to end this case in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau believes that this method is too disadvantageous to the depositors and has rejected it based on the circumstances.</p>

<p>▲A kidnapping case occurred in the Concession</p>
<p>▲Should be notified to the Chinese territory at any time</p>
<p>▲May be intercepted in case of an emergency</p>
<p>Zheng (wrongly written as Chen in yesterday's newspaper) Zizhang, a Teochew native who lived on Haining Road in the Public Concession and opened a Hoji pawnshop, was kidnapped by bandits in front of the house of a foreign prostitute at No. 29 Shantou Road at 0:30 AM yesterday, and disappeared without a trace. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, Zheng's private car was also taken away by the bandits at the same time and could not be found. Until about 2:00 AM yesterday, a black-plated, self-provided green sedan car suddenly stopped at the intersection of Dalin Road and Fangxie Road in the jurisdiction of the Second District Headquarters of Nanshi. The front of the car was facing north, the Concession number was 4633, and the city number was 5695. There was originally post No. 23 set up there, but it was moved to the back road of the Manufacturing Bureau. Police officer Cheng Maoqing discovered the car. After carefully inspecting the car, he found that there was no one in it. After waiting for a long time, he asked the nearby residents, who said that a car suddenly came a while ago, and three people jumped out and went east. The police officer immediately reported to the Second District Headquarters. When District Chief Wang heard the news, he ordered the car to be detained and telegraphed the Public Works Bureau. According to the reply, the car belonged to a Zheng family of Hoji pawnshop on Haining Road. District Chief Wang further inquired from the pawnshop, who said that the car was stolen on Simalu at 12:00 PM and did not mention the kidnapping. It was not until District Chief Wang reviewed the newspaper yesterday morning that he learned the truth. He immediately telegraphed the Supervision Office and notified the Laozha Police Department. The police chief sent Western Detective Kemin and Detective Cui Jinchuan to the Second District Headquarters to request the army to lead them back for investigation. District Chief Wang declared to the Western detective that since a kidnapping case had occurred in the Concession, the car number should be telegraphed to the Chinese police authorities at any time so that they could pay attention to it everywhere and possibly intercept it in case of an emergency. He hoped that in the future, there would be no distinction between boundaries, and that they would communicate with each other in the spirit of mutual assistance to achieve rapid results. The Western detective was quite moved by the words and expressed his apologies in person, taking the car back.</p>

<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we have recently received reports from various sources stating that child traffickers are often found on the streets of Nanshi, specializing in luring and abducting boys and girls, secretly hiding them in organizations organized by the traffickers. They even change their names and teach them how to address people. Once the training is completed, they are trafficked to other places and sold at a high price. In recent days, the number of children who have been abducted and lost has increased. Please take steps to rescue them." According to investigations, the loss of children has indeed been heard daily. If no measures are taken to rescue them, the protection of children will be lost. Our association is a child welfare organization, so we dare to send this letter to urge your bureau to issue a strict prohibition, send more detectives to investigate everywhere, and order all districts to pay attention at all times. Once discovered, they should be severely punished to maintain humanity and restrain the bandits. We believe that your bureau attaches importance to public security and will grant our request."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Declaration of the Chinese Vocational Education Society <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲Revealing the Five Major Causes of National Crisis</p>
<p>▲Hoping the Government Will Implement the Fourteen Proposed Items</p>
<p>▲The Society Now Plans to Realize the Principle of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shuhua, Liu Zhanen, and forty-two other experts from the Chinese Vocational Education Society Expert Conference, issued a statement yesterday, saying,</p>
<p>"Our colleagues in the Society have been diligently researching, promoting, and experimenting with vocational education for many years. We have always presented our humble opinions to the government and contributed to society without fear of trouble. Now that the war has ended and the country is unified, we should work together to realize the principle of people's livelihood and eliminate national crises in their infancy. The Society is holding an expert conference to gather ideas and consider carefully. The result of the meeting is a unanimous call to offer our experience to the government and society. We declare that China's social problems are becoming increasingly serious. After identifying the most prominent, there are approximately several aspects. People often say that the more developed general education is, the more unemployed there are. Although this is due to [omission] relations, it may not be entirely true. However, hundreds of thousands graduate from higher primary schools but cannot enter middle school, and middle school graduates cannot enter university every year. These people are scattered throughout society, achieving neither great nor small success. They have considerable knowledge, cultivating desires beyond ordinary people, but lack specific skills to enter society. What will they do? Filled with depression, it is self-evident whether they are beneficial or harmful to the country and society. This is one.</p>
<p>The difficulty of relieving mass unemployment is common in all countries, but it is even more so in China. According to the 1920 statistical report of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the Society, 2,872 people were entrusted to find employment, including 738 domestic university graduates and 133 foreign university graduates. Those who received higher education eagerly seek work. It is so pitiful, but on the other hand, the job market demands expertise in one skill. Those with high degrees are avoided. Shanghai is the leading commercial port, and one can extrapolate the situation throughout the country. Social enterprises have been declining daily, and the supply and demand of talent are mismatched. How much loss has the country and society suffered? It is impossible to calculate. This is two.</p>
<p>China's new industries are just budding, and they are far more immature than neighboring countries. Factory workers are young and energetic, and their thoughts are easily changed. By the time they are older, their habits are deeply ingrained, and they are often affected by sluggishness. The efficiency of work decreases, and there is no hope of increasing production. Correcting their thinking and changing their environment, everything to prevent disorder and benefit industry, is the most urgent task at present. This is three.</p>
<p>Women's employment is not only related to the prosperity of the family, but also benefits the social organization. Chinese women have never considered employment as important. Our colleagues believe in equal rights for men and women to participate in government [omission] based on [omission] principles. Only by providing society and the country with ample service knowledge and skills can self-reliance and helping others be effective. Whether working outside or managing the family, appropriate training must be given at a suitable age. Whether this approach of emphasizing general education for women is suitable for China's current needs is a major question. This is four.</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture. Today, the major source of food and clothing relies heavily on foreigners. Leaving aside cotton goods, according to the 1919 customs report, the price of imported rice reached over 58.9 million taels, the price of imported wheat reached over 21.4 million taels, and the price of imported flour reached over 62.9 million taels. It is enough to make people tremble. Agriculture is not cultivated, and production is declining daily. Farmers' intelligence is not developed, and there is no way to improve their lives. With such poor, weak, ignorant, and disorganized farmers, who account for more than 85% of the country's population, to say that the country can stand in today's world is nonsense. If we do not take measures to remedy this situation, the consequences are unimaginable. This is five.</p>
<p>The above five points are all urgent and pressing serious problems. To solve them, we cannot rely on one side alone. The key is to rely on vocational education. According to the latest statistics, there are 1,139 middle schools in the country, of which only 149 are vocational schools, accounting for only 13%. There are 234,811 middle school students in the country, of which only 16,641 are vocational school students, accounting for only 7%. The gap between supply and demand is so large that it is no wonder that job seekers cannot find jobs and employers lament the lack of talent. For more than ten years, our colleagues have exhausted their words and pens, ashamed of their inability to help the people's livelihood. The actual facilities are also very limited. What can be seen in society includes industrial and commercial education, agricultural education, sericulture, sewing, and other vocational education for women, various vocational supplementary education, and guidance for further education, employment guidance, and job placement. All of these are only tests of the Society's function, trying to open up new paths for society. However, the song is not high and there are few who harmonize. The brave take the lead and are isolated. The cries of the people's poverty and the exhaustion of wealth are deafening. Our hearts ache at the futility of a drop in the bucket. Today, we can no longer contain ourselves. There are too many reckless elements. Someone at this conference reported that 90% of bandits are soldiers, and 90% of Communists are school graduates. The former clearly reveals the source of the rebellion, and the latter cannot bear the pain of school bankruptcy. What we see is what everyone sees, and our hearts are truly worried. We dare to offer our sincerity and earnestly hope that our government, which governs the country, and our society, in which we live, will implement the following in the shortest possible time:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should unite with the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Transportation, and other ministries to form a committee. From the perspective of talent, each should propose practical methods to connect the supply and demand sides of their respective responsible affairs, so that the use and training of talent can be mutually beneficial. The provincial education departments and municipal education bureaus should also have the same union. (2) The difference between the amount of general education and vocational education needed in various places is very obvious. The establishment of general schools should be restricted and effectively reduced. Vocational schools that have not been established in various places should be planned and established as soon as possible. Those that have been established should strive to fill their content and increase efficiency. (3) The establishment of vocational schools in various places must be extremely linked to both education and vocation. Therefore, the following four types of schools are considered to be more effective: (A) establishing schools in rural areas by zoning; (B) vocational schools running their own agricultural, industrial, and commercial institutions; (C) vocational schools cooperating with vocational groups of the same nature; (D) vocational groups establishing vocational schools of the same nature. All of the above four types allow students to study and practice what they learn in reality. After completing their studies, they must be required to serve in practice for half a year or a year and obtain a certificate of achievement from the manager before being officially granted a diploma. This method should also be adopted for all purposeful education, such as normal schools. (4) Vocational schools should adopt the apprenticeship system of various countries, requiring students to practice for a certain period of time before receiving instruction. This not only develops work habits, but also allows them to learn what they practice, making it easier to increase their interest in the profession. (5) General middle schools in various places must also offer vocational subjects, so that some young people who cannot continue their studies after their group will be able to gain a foothold in society. (6) Industrial and commercial groups in various places should be requested by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Industry to issue an order to organize supplementary education within a time limit to increase the service knowledge and skills of workers, so as to lay the foundation for the development and improvement of industry. (7) A considerable number of places must be designated to pilot rural improvement, with the aim of improving the individual lives of farmers, and then gradually promote it. The method of starting is to train agricultural education teachers on the one hand, and rural police on the other, so that the arms and fingers can be used effectively. (8) Women's vocational education must be promoted in many ways and facilities should be provided as much as possible. The principle should be to promote social service without hindering family life. (9) Teachers for vocational schools must be trained as soon as possible. Rather than setting up separate institutions or establishing vocational subjects in normal schools, it is better to attach vocational normal subjects to vocational schools that have achieved results. (10) The promotion of compulsory education in various places, whether in cities or villages, must establish a standard, that is, do not allow those who are educated to leave their inherent lives absolutely until they have developed their corresponding abilities, so as not to make compulsory education more developed and the social foundation more shaken. (11) Elementary schools should pay special attention to vocational cultivation and provide them with the basic knowledge and skills of the occupation. (12) All levels of education should uniformly implement labor in training to establish a foundation of respect for occupation in the psychology of young people and to enable them to obtain a more correct outlook on life. (13) Vocational guidance centers should be established in various places. The government should select locations, pilot them first, give them full investigation and guidance, and train vocational guidance personnel as soon as possible. (14) Request the central government to establish a policy of industrial and commercial protection and implement it effectively, so that industry can be fully developed, which will not only benefit the way out for talent, but also fundamentally eliminate the danger to the country's future. Our Republic of China really depends on it. The government is entrusted by the people, and society is composed of individuals. It should be able to consider the danger of the national situation and the sincerity of our foolish hearts, show sympathy, adopt our suggestions immediately, and look forward with anticipation. We hereby declare, hoping for your observation."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Orders Reporting of Student Rosters <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructed the provincial experimental elementary schools, saying, "It has been found that the staff and student rosters of each school should be reported in accordance with the regulations after one month from the beginning of the semester for verification. This roster is not only used to examine the changes of staff and students in each school, but also used to verify during graduation, to show importance. It is now found that the Nantong Middle School Experimental Elementary School and the Xuzhou Middle School Experimental Elementary School have not reported for the previous semester, which is a long overdue and very negligent matter. Among the schools that have reported, some only report new students or do not divide by grade, which is too simple to be examined. Now that the second semester of this year has passed one month, the principals of each school should report the staff and student rosters of this semester, together with those that have not been reported in previous semesters, within half a month for verification. When creating the roster, new and old students should be listed in detail by name and grade, without omission. If there are any omissions, it will be rejected during the graduation process. In addition to the separate order, the principal of the school is instructed to comply with this order."</p>

<h3 id="e140">A Word of Wisdom <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>▲ Only women request women's suffrage. No man requests to take over a woman's job, willingly staying home to do the cooking. Only women sing loudly about gender equality. No man volunteers to concurrently hold a woman's position. It's evident that women love to meddle in other people's affairs, an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>▲ A modern woman marries the first time out of curiosity, the second time for love, and the third time for money. Considering the facts, none of this is wrong.</p>
<p>▲ The older you get, the heavier the price of love. A young man can love a woman empty-handed. However, once he's over thirty, he needs stacks of banknotes and large diamonds to attract a young woman's heart.</p>
<p>▲ If you understand the possibility of a certain career and put it into practical work, you can achieve success. If you know the limit, you have gained happiness.</p>
<p>▲ A man can pursue a woman tirelessly, but once he gets her, he inevitably yawns.</p>
<p>▲ A woman spends far more time on dressing than the average man. However, nowadays, a man spends far more time on dressing than a woman, because a modern woman's clothes are often five times less than a man's.</p>
<p>▲ A man with a gentle disposition can forgive anyone except a friend who owes him money and a woman who doesn't get along with him.</p>
<p>▲ Anyone likes to give advice to others, but no one likes to listen, and no one can follow it.</p>
<p>▲ General advice is a very well-decorated criticism. Therefore, a person who is good at criticism is good at giving advice.</p>
<h3 id="e141">A Sketch of a Tibetan Youth with Peculiar Talents <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Wanderer</p>
<p>The young man's surname is Chen, given name Jichang, a person from a remote area in eastern Tibet. One day, introduced by Mr. Xincun, I met and talked with him several times and came to understand the outline of his drifting and wandering to Shanghai. I hereby record it as follows:</p>
<p>Jichang lost his parents at a young age and had no uncles, brothers, or sisters. He was raised in his maternal family. When he was eight years old, a European named Mr. Lawley came to Tibet, partly to preach and partly to do business. Seeing Jichang, he pitied him and immediately took him back to raise him. Thus, this lonely orphan ascended to a real paradise.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawley was fascinated by science and invented a language machine, spending a research fee of 60,000 pounds and taking more than twenty years to finally succeed. This machine could almost all global languages. Its shape was similar to a phonograph, weighing about forty pounds. It's a pity that Mr. Lawley kept it secret and did not publicize it, so the world didn't know about it.</p>
<p>Jichang was intelligent. From a young age, he was fed when hungry and played when full. In addition to doing some work for Mr. Lawley, he used the language machine to learn languages. He mastered a language every three months. As a result, he was quite fluent in our national language, and he could also recognize some Chinese characters. In addition, he was fluent in thirteen languages, including such as Silturi, English, Australian, Egyptian, Javanese, Indian, Tibetan, Hakka, Xiamen, Shantou, Cantonese, Siamese, and Western dialects. He also followed Mr. Lawley to Europe for four and a half years. Mr. Lawley was also a strange man and didn't tell him about his home. Year after year, he was always on the road. So, when Chen was sixteen, Mr. Lawley suddenly left Chen in Tibet and disappeared. Chen had no choice but to live with his uncle. His uncle was scheming. One day, he sold him to a Mongolian as a slave. Every day he cooked tea, poured urine, and dusted chairs and benches. If he slightly disobeyed the master's wishes, he would be whipped immediately. Jichang couldn't bear the suffering. When the master went to Sichuan to trade, he took Jichang with him. One night, he took the opportunity to run away. He wandered to Shanghai, and his travel expenses were exhausted. He was hungry for three days and slept in the alleys at night. Later, he spoke to an Indian policeman, who pitied him and gave him food and clothing for several days. Later, through the introduction of a certain gentleman, he met Mr. Xincun. Mr. Xincun was compassionate and did his best to help the distressed and relieve the poor. He saw him as different and provided him with food and lodging. He first had him take remedial classes and then planned to find him an opportunity to study. But Chen found it difficult. Mr. Xincun set a self-study schedule for him, requiring him to write a certain amount of large and small characters, read newspapers, read books, and practice English every day, and asked him to do it on time. In the evening, he came from afar to supervise him every day. But Chen's slave nature was deeply rooted, and he was afraid of being lazy. Later, he left. Jichang is eighteen years old. Some people don't think he's Tibetan. In fact, he has a thin, dark face, loves smoking, and doesn't like bathing. He is indeed a Tibetan.</p>

<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>According to news from Los Angeles, USA, green eyebrows, silver eyelashes, and golden yellow ears will soon become new decorations for American girls. This argument was made by Mr. Manson, a hairdresser from the Chicago Beauty Association. According to Manson, it's not just that. From now on, the color painted on American women's fingers will also match the color of their clothes or hair. This dyeing method is quite fast and can be changed at any time, it is said. Wouldn't we consider it a strange talk when we hear about it?</p>
<h3 id="e143">Remembering the Lantern Festival in Yuezhong <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Xuehen</p>
<p>The lanterns compete for redness. Suddenly, it's Yue Ren Day. The curtains are rolled up and the wind is gentle. It's the time of the lantern test again. Now is the era of promoting the national calendar. The old lunar lantern festival is like a flower of tomorrow. It should be rare for young people to mention it. But I am a traveler in Shanghai, alone and lonely. Zhong Xuan wrote fu. Jiang Xie recited Yue poems. Thinking of my hometown, how can I stop? I will describe the grand occasion of the lantern festival in Yuezhong in the past to comfort my homesickness. It implies a sense of the changes of the world from the past to the present.</p>
<p>The grandest lantern festivals in Yuezhong are the lantern platforms in Luzhuang and the lantern heads in Taoyan. From the 13th to the 15th night, Jin Wu doesn't prohibit it. The whole city is crazy. The alleys are full of lost slippers. The roads are covered with fallen bracelets. Shoulders rub against each other, and toes touch each other. There is no way to describe its grandeur. The villagers often perform plays during these few days, called lantern head plays. Since there are many plays, you can see stages erected facing each other every ten or tens of steps. The sounds of flutes and pipes are connected to each other. The lanterns include those that resemble people, animals, objects, and flowers and plants, without exception. The lights are strange and dazzling, and cannot be fully understood. In addition to the lantern competition, Luzhuang also has a treasure competition, where the organizers borrow antiques from the local rich families. Antiques, jade, rare treasures, and exotic animals can all be displayed. When I was a child, I heard the old people in the village say that they had seen a coral walking stick that was six or seven feet long and a green jade watermelon. After several changes, I don't know which family these things have flowed into. However, since later generations have been mostly unstable, this custom has gradually declined. I once read the Yuezhong Lantern Poems in the Baihua Jiangfu Pavilion Poetry Collection by the senior Li Chunlao from my hometown. It says: "Good towers on the side of Luzhuang. Ten thousand spring flowers bloom in the candlelight. New makeup comes out to watch under the moon. The fire dragon comes to report the dance in the village ahead." It also says: "The Taoyan Lantern Market is new every year. Everyone celebrates spring together in the temple. The spring stars are gradually scattered and the singing is over. Lanterns help the drunk people in every house." It also says: "What do you do at home to thank the good harvest? I feel even more lost when I think about it as a guest. The first spring night is a good time for the wind and moon. The mountains and rivers are golden and bright for the lantern test day." Closing the book and humming softly, I can't help but deepen my homesickness in this world of red dust.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The First Sound of Butterfly's Voice <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Butterfly's performance art has long been recognized as the leading figure in the Chinese film industry. Her slight smile, light frown, slight anger, and other actions, even a gesture or a step, have been deeply imprinted in the minds of our audience. Everything contains the word beauty. But I still feel regret that I can't personally hear her clear singing and charming voice.</p>
<p>Since Western talkies were transported to our country and screened, I have also been to listen and watch. I still feel that the progress of our people is far from as agile as theirs. At that time, I thought that in the near future, there might be domestic works to resist imported goods. Sure enough, as I expected, recently, Mr. Zhang Shichuan, the president of the Mingxing Company, accepted the commission of the Minzhong Company and joined forces with the Pathe Company, which specializes in sound films, and spent six months and cut off 120,000 capital. After four or five trials, the sound was finally tested at the Guanglu Grand Theater. I was fortunate to be invited by a friend to see it first. It turned out that the protagonist of the new film "Songstress Red Peony" was the well-known and famous Ms. Butterfly. When the lady's singing first started, the audience in the hall applauded thunderously. After the movie ended, visitors from all walks of life congratulated the authorities of the Mingxing Company. Everyone said that the ancestor of domestic silent films was "Orphan Saves Ancestor," and the definite arrow of domestic sound films was "Songstress Red Peony." According to the film's beauty, it is tight-knit, can echo back and forth, has a very deep stimulating nature, and can make ordinary female comrades cry out loud. As for the other interlude and supporting roles, they are all the choice of the moment. In my humble opinion, in addition to the hard work of Director Zhang and Ms. Hu, the screenwriter's brain is the most admirable. It is said that the film's release period at sea is imminent, probably to be screened at the Xinguang Grand Theater first.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Small Arts in Wuzhong <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Fengmu</p>
<p>Reading the Free Talk, I saw Qing Qu's note about kneading statues in Wuzhong. I still remember this person, and I can remember several things related to him. So, I will write them down together.</p>
<p>(1) Kneading Statues: This person's surname seems to be Xu. At first, he was also a member of the laboring class, not a noble young master. Kneading statues doesn't have to be done at night. Kneading a statue only sells for two Buddha coins. But if you want to make seasonal clothes, hats, shoes, and small shrines for the statue, it will cost dozens to hundreds of yuan, because the cost is huge and it takes a long time. This person has a strange habit. He is never willing to perform his skills for others until the opium is about to run out. This has the air of a famous person. He never taught apprentices, because it was difficult to find someone suitable. He has two sons, neither of whom can pass on his art. So, after his death, no one inherited his industry. What a pity.</p>
<p>(2) Grass Insects Made from Orchid Leaves: Using a single orchid leaf, mantises and grasshoppers are made, all lifelike. When I was a child, I saw them in Yuanmiao Temple. They were sold and made on the spot. The operation was extremely fast. Each one was only sold for three or four coins.</p>
<p>(3) Monkeys Made from Medicinal Herbs: Using a magnolia bud as the monkey's body, a whole cicada skin is disassembled to make the monkey's head and limbs, a thin piece of licorice is used as its crown, and a black bean is used as a peach. Some monkeys squat on rocks, which are sea pumice stones. Each one is also only sold for ten or more coins.</p>
<p>(4) Figures Made from Sweet Potato Flour: Using cooked sweet potato flour, mixed with water of five different colors, various figures and dramas are kneaded, no different from the clay figures in the Yao Huo store under Huiquan Mountain, but more exquisite. The value is determined by the complexity of the process. However, the most expensive ones are not more than a hundred coins. This art was still occasionally seen more than ten years ago, but now it has disappeared, because the cost of living is increasing and those who do this can't make a living, so they all changed to other industries.</p>
<p>(5) Fragrant Beads Carved from Lotus Seeds: The above are all made by people from the lower class. This is made by ladies in wealthy families. The method is to use extremely old lotus seeds, knead them extremely softly by hand, and then carve them with embroidery needles. You can carve whatever you want in the way of calligraphy and painting. But the lotus seeds are easily broken when kneading, and you must use extremely light surgery. It is said that only one or two out of every ten can be made, even for the most skilled surgeons. After eighteen are completed, they are strung with colored silk, and a string of fragrant beads is made. My friend Pan Jun Zhuxiao once had a string, which was handmade by his wife. Everyone who saw it praised it as exquisite.</p>
<p>From this, we know that our Chinese people are most rich in artistic ideas. It is a pity that no one advocates them, letting them disappear without a trace, and even like the Guangling San, which is not passed down to future generations. It is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Random Talks on Traveling in Europe (3) <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>At that time, I mentioned the Leifeng Pagoda in West Lake. Its long history can be compared with the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It wasn't until it collapsed suddenly that everyone wanted to rebuild it. It's not necessary to redo historical relics. There are also the sculptures by Yang Hui of Kunshan Yongzhi Town. It wasn't until the broken temple collapsed that everyone sighed. The late Japanese Omura Seigai once told me ten years ago, "If you don't repair it, I am willing to initiate the repair." At that time, I also told many people, but they didn't care about this matter. It's too late to take action after it collapses. Now they are rebuilding the temple, but only four or five of the dozen or so Buddha statues are left. How regrettable this is. But it is also because we lack specialized talents to study antiques.</p>
<p>Seeing an antique can evoke historical, artistic, and emotional influences. The basis of culture lies in this point. I finally feel that it is necessary to organize art galleries in various places in China now. Even if Chinese antiques are transported abroad, there are still many historical heritages that have not been completely moved. Nanjing, Shanghai, and other provinces must organize antique preservation institutions (that is, art galleries). If there is an organization, there will be specialized talents to study it.</p>
<p>The Antique Museum in Beiping has recently been run in a very orderly manner. Tianjin has also successively discovered them. Is it possible that no one cares about this matter in Nanjing, the capital, and Shanghai, the first commercial port in the East? I am determined to promote this matter first after returning to China. People in the country who care about cultural undertakings will also have some sympathy.</p>
<p>An hour after the car departed from Bi Zha, it arrived in Spezia. This question is about beautiful mountains and clear waters. The car circles around the mountains, as if traveling in Switzerland on the mountains. Spezia is surrounded by marble. As seen along the car, the ground is full of marble pieces. Many villagers make a living by opening stones. The car travels about thirty minutes out of the mountain bay, passing through more than twenty mountain tunnels, all along the strait. When passing through the mountain tunnels, it is suddenly bright and dark, making people dizzy. Every time you exit a hole, you can see the sea. After passing through the last mountain tunnel, the station is called Ropallo Station. The buildings along the strait are novel. There are many hotels, like the shores of the Four Forest Lake in Switzerland. It is cleaner than other places. It is said that this is a summer resort. After stopping for twenty minutes, the car continued forward and arrived in Genoa. This is one of the most lively commercial ports in Italy.</p>
<p>Looking far away, there are countless ships parked. The surrounding scenery is excellent. Many passengers got off the car at the R station. After the car left, Yu and Jun stood in the car compartment to dine. Good Italians have guest meals to buy along the way. Various foods are packed in a paper bag, and all the things that should be included in the dinner are fully equipped. Each bag is ten lira (equivalent to two yuan in national currency). The Japanese are good at imitation. The Bian Dang (meals sold at the station) at the station is modeled after this style. The car arrived in Torino in the middle of the night. I transferred to a car going to Lyon, France. After changing cars, there were not many passengers and I rested in the car. I was tired from traveling for several days and slept soundly.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Financial Fluctuations in the Gold Market are Extremely Large</p>
<h3 id="e147">Finally Down Twelve Taels Seven <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Situation is High and Then Low: Yesterday, the gold standard for March 9th was very volatile, going from high to low. However, the fluctuations were still very small. In a short period, there were four or five taels of difference. In the end, it fell thirteen taels. The volatility of the market is indescribable. There was a swing of twenty-two taels. Foreign exchange was nominally tight but actually loose, with the listed price shrinking by half a level. Buying and selling above the market was not uncommon. The intentions of various firms were confused, so demand and supply were divergent. Hengxing, Yu Da, Yuan Mao Yong, and others all bought in, while Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, and others bought and then sold. Chengfeng, Yongyuan Heng, and others all sold heavily. The overseas silver market saw a decline in prices in the telegrams the day before yesterday. As a result, the gold price opened high. After that, there were often hidden dangers. At noon, sellers were crowded, especially as foreign exchange became looser and looser. It fell from 746 taels in the morning to within 30 taels. The afternoon market was initially stable, but then it hovered around 30 taels. Because Dalian Gang Dadesheng and those who specialize in foreign exchange arbitrage sold in the first month, and the British exchange rate became looser again, with 1 shilling 3 pence 375 able to be purchased. The gold market quickly shrank and declined, with a feeling of declining like a river. It fell from thirty-three or four taels to within twenty-five taels. Afterwards, the shorts took the opportunity to cover their positions and pulled up six or seven taels again, breaking through thirty taels. However, the situation at the close seemed soft, and there were rumors that the large firms were bullish this morning. ▲ Morning Opened Well, Up Four Taels: The four-month opening in the morning was 746 taels 5 qian, an increase of four taels. The price of large bars fell by a quarter, the price of silver fell by eight-three-eighths, and private telegrams also fell by sixteen-three-eighths. Next was 6 taels 8 qian. Tai Changchun, Yuanyong, and goods came to sell, and it had fallen to 43 taels. Yuxing, Yonghengxing, and retail customers bought in. The British Gold Bank had eaten 1,20625, so it rose to 46 taels 9 qian. Suddenly, the selling party became active, and British gold was looking long, and when the shilling was announced, it fell to 42 taels and a half. Although the listed price shrank by 125, the US dollar by 25, and the Japanese gold increased by 1 qian 25, there was no increase, only 43 taels. Shunli Qian Changxiang Wanxing and others sold. Mitsui and Hefeng did 13,125 British gold, so at 10 o'clock it fell to 37 taels and a half. At this time, Yuan Mao Yong Tong Taichang and others bought in, and Sumitomo ate 0625 British gold. It was said that it rose by five taels at one cloud, totaling 42 taels 45 qian. After entering, the foreign exchange market was still sluggish. Mitsui sold 25, and North Korea sold 1 tael and 8.25 qian of Japanese gold. Tong Taichang Fuchang and others sold. At 10:30, when only 36 taels, it was raised again to 39 taels 45 qian. After 11 o'clock, waves arose, and large firms Qian Changxiang Dadesheng Fuchang and others went all out to sell, and the price plummeted, plummeting eleven or twelve taels. At noon it was 27 taels and a half. By the close, it was 29 taels 5 qian. It was then pulled up another tael, so the goods were raised by 1 tael 3 qian, and the announced price was changed to 797 taels 4 qian, a total of 55 taels to 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Closing Weak and Powerless: The afternoon market opened at 28 taels and a half, then 7 taels 23 qian, and Shunli Wanxing and others sold. Suddenly, Fuchang Hengxing and others bought in, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had shrunk by three or four annas, so it rose immediately. At 2:15, it was 34 taels. Afterwards, Yuan Mao Yong Taixing Wanxing and arbitrageurs fought to sell. It was also learned that the Indian exchange rate had increased by 11 annas. People's hearts were frustrated, and it suddenly plummeted by more than 7 taels. At 2:30, it was 26 taels and a half. In an instant, it rose to 30 taels and 5 qian. There was a tael difference at that time. Later, British gold turned loose, and 3,125 could be settled. Especially Heng Yu Dadesheng goods and various firms sold. The waves were turbulent, and it fell by 6 taels. At about 4 o'clock, it was suddenly 24 taels 5 qian. Then, Hengxing Yuyu and others came to buy, and it was激上 by 7 taels. At 4:10, it was 31 taels and a half. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 29 taels 8 qian, a drop of 12 taels 7 qian compared to last Saturday, and the state of confusion was incomprehensible. The maximum price in the before market was 46 taels 9 qian, the minimum price was 24 taels 5 qian, a total swing of 22 taels 3 qian. The morning market for goods was 46 taels 5, noon closed at 30 taels 8 qian, afternoon 27 taels 5, closed at 29 taels, the price was 70 taels, registered 23 taels to 30 taels,补水 was 23 taels, the afternoon was the same.</p>
<p>▲ Diversified Receipts and Payments in the Industry: Various firms traded, including Hengxing, Tong Taichang, Yu Da, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Taiheng, Yuxingyong all bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, Dadesheng, Yuan Tai, Fuchang, Zhifeng Yong, Qian Changfu, etc., sometimes bought and sold frequently. Chengfengyong, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Hengyu all sold goods for arbitrage purposes, so the entry and exit were different. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Fuchang, Yuan Chengyong, Yuyu, Yu Da, Tong Taichang all bought in. Shunli, Taixing, Dadesheng, Fu Qinheng, Wanxing, Yuan Mao Yong all sold prudently. Qian Changxiang, Tanfengyong and others suddenly bought and sold arbitrageurs, so they扒 foreign exchange bills. Dalian Gang sold a total of 2,560 bills and bought 1,000 bills. Guang Gang bought 2,000 bills.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Foreign Exchange is Nominally Tight but Actually Loose <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listed prices for all foreign exchanges had shrunk by half a level. Almost the British and American silver markets reported a drop of one tael the day before, with British gold shrinking by 125 to 1 shilling 2 pence 75, the US dollar by 25 to 29 yuan 875, Indian exchange by 75 to 82 rupees and a half, French francs by 6 yuan to 762 yuan, German exchange by 1 yuan to 125 marks 5, Japanese half a yuan by 74 guilders and a half, Singapore exchange increased by 1 tael 75 to 188 taels 25, Hong Kong increased by 25 to 78 taels, and Japanese gold increased by 1 qian 25 to 1 tael 6 qian 5 and a half. However, the transaction price of the bank was initially stable, but then it loosened due to the fall in the gold price. The afternoon was initially flat and then sluggish, and the gold standard fell into a state of fatigue again, breaking through the 730 tael mark. The result was that British gold increased by 25, the US dollar by half a yuan, and Japanese gold fell by three points compared to last Saturday. The difference between nominal and actual was very different. Chinese gold merchants bought after selling, with a total of more than 400,000 pounds of British gold traded. In the morning, Mitsui Sumitomo HSBC and others all bought in, and Huabi Bank and Mitsui also sold a little. In the afternoon, North Korea, Huabi, Mitsui, etc. all had sales, and the various firms mainly arbitrage gold, and the various banks traded more than 100,000 pounds with each other. There were not many US dollar in and outs, but Japanese gold was exchanged between various firms and Huabi Korea Sanlin Mitsui etc. for one hundred and dozens of millions of yuan.

<h3 id="e149">There Will Be Improvement in the Silver Dollar Market <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview</p>
<p>For days, the money houses have only been trading for half a day, so the situation of collections and settlements, although sorted throughout the day, still feels desolate. This period of tranquility is about to pass. Starting today, there will be afternoon trading, and from then on, the market can return to its original state, and it may even become tighter than in autumn and winter. As for the ups and downs of interest rates on silver loans, it is not something that anyone can predict. However, if current forward contracts for foreign silver are not made, the trading situation will never be as smooth as before.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Prices</p>
<p>The "foreign silver interest" early market interest rate is still chaotic, only slightly better than the previous day by one hao two hu and a half, at seven qian two fen three li one hao two hu and a half. However, the trading situation is worse than the market situation on each Monday that has passed since then. It can be said that the market atmosphere has not yet recovered. Yesterday's "silver discount" still opened at two fen. The demand for silver is slightly better than last week. It is expected that the silver discount may improve thereafter, although there will be no major changes, it is still worth watching.</p>
<p>▲ Copper Coin Market Situation</p>
<p>The early market for small Jiangnan silver dollars was six qian five fen, slightly down one li compared to the previous day. Trading volume was 5,000 jiao. There was no activity in both directions for small Guangdong silver dollars, so the market price remained unchanged. Yesterday, it remained in its original position, at six qian two fen four li and a half, down one li and a half from the previous day. Trading volume was 155,000 jiao. Copper coins rose by 1,500 wen, to 365,500 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Silver</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and bank collections and settlements seemed slightly larger than usual. Chinese merchants collected and settled 2.3 to 2.4 million in drafts, foreign merchants collected and settled 1.7 to 1.8 million in drafts, various goods, foreign exchange taxes and miscellaneous items collected and settled over 8 million, 300,000 entered the warehouse, and 600,000 left the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and settled over 3.7 million in various items, and 500,000 left the warehouse. Money houses and silver firms collected and settled over 28 million in drafts, settlement drafts collected and settled over 4.4 million, and remittances collected and settled over 400,000, with several tens of thousands in cash. The early market for "foreign silver" remittance drafts reached 1.505 million, with 70,000 in banknotes, 122,000 in off-exchange banknotes, 850,000 in bank transactions, over 100,000 in interbank settlements, 1.2 million in banknote inflows and outflows, over 5.1 million in money house and silver firm settlements, over 100,000 in foreign firm settlement drafts, over 80,000 in foreign silver loans, over 50,000 in customer sources, and over 50,000 in small money house transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were very few spot transactions for public bonds, and futures were also quieter than last week. The sentiment of buyers and sellers throughout the day was quite scattered. As for the price changes of various issues, the morning sessions were firmer, with most issues continuing to rise slightly compared to the end of last week. In the afternoon, the buying interest was slightly sluggish, leading to a decline, with only two or three jiao of fluctuation compared to the previous day. The total spot transactions for the day were only 11,000 yuan, and futures totaled about 6.7 million. The 1929 Customs and the Disbandment and Reorganization Loan were better, while others were far inferior to before.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Yarn, Cotton, and Cotton Yarn Markets Show Downstream Trends <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the trend is softening because the overseas cotton yarn market conditions are unanimously trending downstream, and the long exchange rate has weakened people's hearts. The demand for yarn on the market is unusually quiet, and each group has no intention of acting. The bottom inventory of each factory has inevitably increased day by day, resulting in the decline of the market. However, a certain large manufacturer still purchases when prices fall and refuses to relax. However, outsiders see that actual sales are not rising and the exchange rate is turning, so bulls are selling off, and various issues have broken the 70 tael mark.</p>
<p>▲ Distant Month Contracts Dropped by Up to Three Taels</p>
<p>In the early market for distant month contracts, the decline in both Indian and American cotton led to a lack of enthusiasm in the market and a loosening of the market. Each issue fell by seven or eight qian to one tael eight or nine qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price had fallen again, and yarn transactions were not smooth, and the situation became more and more weak, and the selling pressure was even heavier. Each month fell by one tael five, six, or nine qian to two taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,400 bales. It was found that Hen Tai sold 2,250 bales, Gong Tai 100 bales, Tian Long 2,000 bales, Chang Feng 1,000 bales, and De Ji 950 bales. Tong Xing bought 1,700 bales, Rong Xing 5,200 bales, Yi Chang 1,300 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,450 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲ Spot Transactions of 705 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still sluggish. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various groups throughout the day was 705 bales. 425 bales were entered by the same trade. The market price fell sharply. Among the customers, 425 bales were entered to the mainland, 180 bales were entered to Niuzhuang, 20 bales were entered to Guangdong, 50 bales were entered to Jiangxi, 5 bales were entered to Wuhu, 15 bales were entered to Xiamen, and 10 bales were entered to Shantou.</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is trending towards a softening trend, because the exchange rate is lengthening, the gold price is falling sharply, and the trend of both Indian and American cotton is showing a weakening trend, resulting in a combined decline in both explicit and implicit prices. As a result, there are fewer new buyers, and most profit-taking bulls, seeing the environment, are competing to settle, and the market's declining wind is intensifying. Spot cotton transactions are quiet, because the speculation price is not strong, and the intention of each factory to operate is even more slack. The future still depends on the gold price and foreign cotton to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Cotton Drops Again by 8 or 9 Qian</p>
<p>In the early market for Han Standard Cotton, the decline in foreign cotton and the poor gold market led to a lack of buyers. Each fell by five or six qian. At the close, a large customer purchased and rose, resulting in a rise of one and a half qian for the current month and a drop of three or four qian for the distant month. In the afternoon, the spot cotton market atmosphere was still thin, with the current month falling by nine and a half qian and the distant month falling by four or six qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 107,600 dan. It was found that Tian Long sold 5,200 dan, Ji Feng 1,500 dan, Da Fu 1,400 dan, Chang Feng 7,300 dan, De Ji 2,900 dan, Xie Sheng 2,600 dan, and Rui Da 2,100 dan.

<p>▲ Spot Transactions Still in a Sluggish State</p>
<p>Spot cotton business is still depressed. Each factory has no operating interest. It is estimated that there are 740 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 45.75, Jardine Matheson Factory enters 100 pieces to send to the factory.</p>

<p>▲ Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday, inland ships arrived, and sales were brisk due to rain and snow in the early morning. Shop owners also had good intentions. White rice was one jiao higher, and ordinary medium-grade rice rose by two jiao, with brisk transactions. Some customers began to buy Bo Dao rice, which was also scarce, so the price rose by one or two jiao. The opening price was 11.2 yuan. The sales of Yang Du Jian rice were normal, and the overall market was firm. The circulation of Tong Bian Yin Yuan was slightly more active, but the hanging workshops were paying attention to high-quality goods, so the situation was tight and high-priced.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from Heshia was very limited. Changxi Ji Geng rice sold well, and people's hearts were optimistic. Su Tong Bai Geng rice also sold well in small quantities. The market in the north also reported higher prices, so each type of Geng rice rose by about two jiao. The Bo Dao and early rice production areas in the south were not as profitable as the Shanghai market, and the supply was scarce, so most of the cargo owners sold in installments, rising by half a jiao. The sales of Yang Du Jian rice were normal, and the market was tight by one jiao. The trend of Bian Yin Yuan was firm and sales were still acceptable. The opening price of the top Bian Yuan was 11.9 yuan. The overall market situation in the north and south was trending upward, but this situation may not last long.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Flour Market Turns Tired After Being Lively <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening of each month's market in the morning, once showed a lively image. Although the quotation for foreign wheat rose by about two jiao, and the weather still felt cold since the beginning of spring, yesterday's sixth snowfall also danced, so the hearts of people inside and outside were quite firm. The initial opening of each month was still flat, and then gradually improved, better than the closing of the previous week by more than one point. Until the opening of the afternoon, the situation changed again, and each month fell one after another. The gold price fell sharply, as low as more than 720 taels. The exchange rate had already been extended, and the ordering of foreign wheat became easier. The factories still had a lot of pressure to sell. Later, it was feared that there would be more supply than demand, so it was still seen as tired. As a result, this month was a little bit weaker than the previous day by five li, April and June were unchanged, and May, July, and August were better by two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Futures Wheat Market Goes From Firm to Soft <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a state of initial firmness followed by decline. In the morning, each session quoted foreign wheat due to the cold spring and the sixth snowfall, which was also about two jiao better. Therefore, the thoughts of outsiders turned stronger, and temporary speculative buyers were quite active. The same price of each month had returned to two, three, or four points better. Until the opening in the afternoon, the gold price fell sharply, and the arbitrage of those in the trade was also very smooth. Each month then fell back. Although most of the current settlements are centered on the gold market, in fact, the shorts have foreign wheat in preparation. If the demand is not as strong as the supply, the future will not be stable. As a result, this month was unchanged, April and May were slightly down by one point, June was unchanged, July was better by two points, and August was slightly down by one point.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Northern Traders Slightly Handle Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market conditions remained silent. Only the Qinhuangdao traders in the Tong Market handled 200 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice, and the price was still 13 yuan. In fact, the arrival was hopeless, and the cargo owners were holding on to scarce goods, but the traders did not ask for prices because the price was too high. The market was dull. There were still local customers consulting about Ke Yuan rice, but the arrival was rare and the inventory was scarce. The market will also turn into a state of silence. However, rice merchants will find it difficult to transport Ke Xian rice, and Du rice cannot meet the export demand of Ke rice traders. They will transport rice from Hong Kong, Annam, Siam, and Korea to Shanghai in hopes of meeting the market, but rice from Annam, Siam, etc. cannot make a profit due to the gold price.</p>

<p>▲ The Trend of Marking Prices is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reported that the spot sugar price in Cuba remained unchanged, and the New York futures sugar for March also had no rise or fall. Each step of the remaining days fell by one point. Both the existing and futures sugar in Java had no incoming telegrams. In the market of the Public Association, due to the sluggish actual sales and the long foreign exchange rate, the buying interest was even more quiet, and the market situation was weaker. Although Dutch sugar No. 24 refined white sugar was released, it still maintained 10 taels and 7 qian and a half, but the acceptance was quiet, and there were no transactions in the entire market. The trend of Japanese sugar was even more withered, because the factory's selling pressure was very strong. The YT mark price was 10 taels and 6 qian, the YP mark was 10 taels and 8 qian, and the "了" mark was 11 taels. The transactions were very scarce, and the market was flat and tired. Taitoo ○ mark sugar was only allowed to sell half of the delivery in March and April, with a total of 2,500 bags, and the price was 3 yuan and 8 jiao plus tax per day in gold. The price was still appropriate, and Dutch red sugar was affected. The number plates of the state-produced Wufu ice were opened at 100 boxes, and the price was 9 taels, and they were sold through. The stock of Taiyuan ice in the market has been cut off. It is heard that it will arrive in a few days, so the Wufu ice number plate has already been transferred.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port still had no trend of turning smooth. It was found that the overseas silk telegrams did not turn around yesterday, and the exchange rate fluctuated constantly. Although the European firms had a stomach for it, the spot price was not high, and it was difficult for Chinese silk firms to sell. Yesterday, only Hua Tong and other Huaihu white factories processed 20 packages, Ke Chang entered 10 packages of Bai Qian Jing, and Samsung entered 15 packages of coarse silk. The prices were all flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Yingzhuang Association, Jinlong Baochang and other firms of Zhenmei green tea in Wuyuan Gaozhuang all began to move, but the overseas incoming prices were too low, and many negotiations failed. The local Zhaozhuang Zhenmei Zhucha, Tongfu Duder and other firms also slightly improved. The total number of transactions in the city was more than 200 boxes. The selling price of Xia Mu was 41 taels. The selling price of Zhenmei was between 19 taels and 22 taels, and there was no increase or decrease compared with before.

<p>The piece goods market trended slightly higher yesterday, because the customer sales are becoming more and more smooth, and the thoughts of the merchants have not yet relaxed. Therefore, the Huzhong Pavilion Baize has risen by two and a half li, and Sanyou's return has also risen accordingly, with a selling price of three qian and three fen. There were transactions from the traders in Hankou Changhe, Jiangxi, etc., but Baoqiu Gucheng will continue to trend downstream. The Han traders are searching for direct satin very hard. Yesterday, the shops all needed three qian and six fen, the four scholars two qian five fen and two and a half li, the Yueting three qian and four fen. After the price of bleached cloth rose from the western goods, the sales also gradually became active. Guo Ziyi sold for 12 taels and 7 qian and a half, Fushou Samsung for 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, and Hua Niao for 9 taels and 2 qian and a half. However, the Yuan 绸 is gradually falling. San Tan has sold for 12 taels and 7 qian, Zhulin for 12 taels and 2 qian and a half, Huan Taizi for 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, and Qing Guan Jing for 13 taels, all of which have fallen by two qian and a half to five qian compared with before, which is affected by the sharp fall in the prices of Jiaozhuang goods. Western goods are black soft but white and straight. Bleached cloth Fu 绸 and 生罗 are rising in price. Yuan Yu 绸 has fallen sharply. Shuang Xian 布 has risen sharply. Good Hua goods are opened at five qian and two and a half fen, and Gong Da goods are at five qian.</p>

<p>法 绒 is a special item needed for making headgear in the western part of Henan, and it is a popular wool product in late spring and early summer. Each of the seagoing woolen goods companies sells it. The average price of the best quality is about five taels per piece, and the second-grade is only sold for two taels. The retail price in the store is different, depending on the quality of the body and the popularity of the market and the sales. Yesterday, the demand for headgear 法 绒 rose sharply. The western clothing tailoring shops of the local traders are all requesting samples and purchasing them. The woolen goods association is also asking each other. The general brand of 法兰 绒 is sold at more than four taels, five taels and two qian and a half, and five taels and five or six qian. The lower grade goods also need to be sold at three taels and a half (formerly only sold at two taels and four or five qian). It is heard that the stock is still lacking and it is difficult to find more.</p>

<p>Because the stock of magnolia seeds is in short supply and the license number has long been cut off, yesterday, Yichang Wheel of Taitoo Company checked and found a batch of only ten boxes imported from Xiamen. The goods were in good condition and were immediately cashed out, which was four or five taels higher than the previous plate. There are still several boxes of secondary merchants that have not been cashed out, but it is still far from the new period. If there are goods with delicate yellow color, the market price may reach 50 taels.</p>

<p>The English tinplate market has been exceptionally good recently, presumably because of the small amount of goods and the strong demand. Yesterday, the Xin 泰古 and other repair shops arrived with 2,500 boxes of spot goods. It was found that they were all purchased by the Tianjin traders at a price of 16 taels. Other traders in Kaifeng and Sichuan also want to add more, but there is not much spot goods on the market, so the traders have no goods to purchase. It is heard that foreign firms such as Baolong and Jicheng have spot goods to arrive, so the general purchasers have been contacting them separately, so the market is quite good. The transaction of American goods was still idle yesterday, and the price was 17 taels and a half for 90 pounds and 18 taels and two qian and a half for 100 pounds. It is heard that the transaction was only slightly embellished by the egg factory traders, and there were no other transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Bachelor Club of Determined Aspiration <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Gou Can</p>
<p>This seems to be a rather peculiar and interesting organization in student life.</p>
<p>Although the co-educational system has been implemented for several years, and the call for gender equality has also attracted the attention of the majority in society, everything in society is always contradictory. In reality, even highly educated ladies seem to be separated by an invisible fence. Among them, female students are often regarded by modern students (?) as special, and they seem to consider it a privilege to get close to them. "Queens," "campus belles," women's photos printed in pictorials, and discussions about female student life in wall newspapers are all products of this. What I am about to say may also be a product of this contradictory society.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifth, an English notice was suddenly discovered on the bulletin board, with several articles of association attached at the end. Immediately, a group of people gathered around, whispering to each other, their faces showing a kind of surprised expression. It turned out to be a membership recruitment notice for the Bachelor Club (pachojorgclub). Originally, we could also translate it as the "Bachelor Society," but looking at its articles of association, it did not contain a single bachelor's sentiment, but was full of an attitude of seeking love. Under the "Purpose," we can write it as the following: "The purpose of this club is to enhance the goodwill of modern women with a proper attitude and elegant behavior." Under the "Rules," there is the following rule: "All public actions or words between members must be spoken in English in order to maintain confidentiality." In the place where the name is signed, no mailing address is written. Yesterday, someone had already attached the following English sentence to the paper, "Tell me, where is the club address?" But there was no response.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, this prominent notice naturally aroused the surprise of the general public, especially among female students. "Who is the initiator, what is the background, what is the purpose?" and similar questions are constantly being asked among the students in search of answers. Therefore, this semi-public, semi-secret notice has become the central point of discussion among the students. Some people think it is a modern act, some people think it is a product of improper motives, some people think it is a manifestation of respect for women, and some people think it is a humiliation of women, and a demon in the call for gender equality. However, although there is constant debate and exploration, no one has yet obtained the answer as to who initiated it, becoming a mystery that all students in the school want to solve.</p>
<p>Dear readers, what kind of environment do you think this is a product of?</p>
