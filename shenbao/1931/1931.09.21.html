<p>（東京）　日政府對於解决满洲事件方針如下、</p>
<p>（一）日軍之軍事行動、田於自衞、</p>
<p>（一）善後交涉、由地方解决、不與中央政府折衝、</p>

<p>（東京）　近二十四小時内、此間官塲對於满洲事件、似已稍變其觀念、彼等漸信日軍所取之行動、實出於若干性急下級軍官之虚張威勢、蓋若輩因上級軍官對中村案之政策、過於懦弱、咸爲不平也、先是、數日前瀋陽傳來消息、東北軍參謀長榮臻照會瀋陽日總領事、謂已查明中村乃某軍官部下之兵所殺、同時且傳已派騎兵隊往拘與該案疑有直接關係之某軍官等十一人、於是外間咸以爲旣經懲兇日本當局即可满意、不致再有其他要求、下級軍官聞此消息、大爲憤懑、乃取自由行動、中日雙方因近來疊起事端、本已鬱積、種激昻不平之氣、此實由不負責之行動爲之導火、馴至愈趨愈烈、乃釀成今次不幸之事端、今日此間接官報稱、瀋陽安謐、惟目下之大局、尚未可以全城交還中國、日政府今日接南京政府之嚴重抗議、其中責日本不顧凱洛格非戰公約、並要求立即撤退强佔中國土地之日軍、預料日本覆文將於明日發出、内容未悉、今日雖爲星期日、而當軸仍紛開重要會議、其一爲首相與外相間之會議、現信兩人正在考慮可助和平解决之建議（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>迫害世界之日軍暴行</h3>
<p>日軍在我東北暴行。截至今日。尚有加無已。關東軍司令部旣已移入瀋陽。營口長春安東遼陽延邊等處。亦都被佔據我國嚴持鎭靜絶無抵抗。而自朝鮮方面開來之日軍。尚紛紛出動。青島方面日海軍陸戰隊亦武裝登陸。準備挑釁。此種背棄公理違犯國際公法之日帝國主義者之猙獰面目。至此蓋已暴露無遺。應爲全世界各國所共見。</p>
<p>日人此次之暴行。甚接予我國以創衂。間接對美國與蘇俄挑戰。决非中日兩國間之簡單問題。吾人昨日旣已歷引日朝野最近之言論。加以申述矣實則日人之意。尚不止此。而實公然對世界挑戰爲有意的引起太平洋上戰禍。</p>
<p>自第一次世界大戰以後世界重心移向太平洋上。蓋毫無疑義。而所謂遠東問題之以中國問題爲焦點。亦爲世界所公認。我東北廣博平原。事實上歷年來已成爲遠東糾紛之策。源地故有人直指爲東方之巴爾幹。日人於清日日俄兩役之後。在我東北植下深固之勢力。復乘歐洲大戰之機。更以哀的美敦書迫我承認二十一條。無限的擴大其權益。其處心積慮。無時不欲實現其「明治滅亡满蒙」之遺策。以進而征服東亞。問鼎世界。田中義一曾言。「如欲征服支那。必先征服满蒙。如欲征服世界。必先征服支那。期隱然以歐戰以前之德意志自居。蓋昭然若揭。故此次暴行。實爲日人有計劃的江蘇激起東方巴爾幹之巨浪。點燃太平洋上戰禍之導火線質言之。「東方之德意志。」茲已向世界投擲戰書。不然。就使如日人所宣傳。實施武力發動。由我軍隊掘毁南满路所引起。但何不可示人以確實證據。以外交手續正當解决。而必突施暴力襲擊。不宣而戰。且中國軍隊。旣已全無抵抗。退出日軍襲擊之各地矣。更何必紛調軍隊。積極作戰其狃於清日日俄兩役。不惜窮兵黷武。步歐戰前之德意志之後塵。明眼人應有共見。德意志旣已受公理與正義之最後裁制矣。維護正義與和平之列國。今究將何以處置繼德意志而起之日本乎。</p>
<p>退一步言。即使日人蹂躪我東北。與世界痛癢不相關。我國今日又新遭洪水。自救不暇。無法以言抗禦。假使日人遂得趁我危難。攘奪我東北大陸。則野心勃勃之日人。將更如虎添翼。取撫順之煤。鞍山之鐵。露積之糧秣。利用我東北之富源。進與美國蘇聨以至世界彈丸之資本相周旋。蓋爲必然。田中義一又謂。「夫如是戰時之食料及原料可足。美國雖有雄大之海軍。支那雖有衆多之陸軍。赤俄雖有衆多之軍兵。終必無如我何。」豈惟美國。豈惟中國與赤俄。虎旣生翼。世界各國。又能如彼何。</p>
<p>總之。日人此次對我實施武力侵略。固爲我國之生死關頭。要亦即全世界一嚴重問題。一髮偶牽。全身摇動。第一次世界大戰之慘酷。記憶猶新。趁此禍機初發。愛好和平之世界各國。應立即予以有效之裁制。</p>
<p>中國人民。半數沉溺水中。忍死待救。尚有保力。以抗强暴。但非戰公約簽字之墨瀋猶新。國際聨盟之會議未閉。中日兩國都已加入非戰公約與國際聨盟如何處置此嚴重之事態。非戰公約同盟。應有以表示其最高之權力。中國全體國民。當一致忍辱負重。靜候非戰公約同盟國與國際聨盟應急有效之處置。</p>

<h3>忽略堤防之調查（續）</h3>
<p>（二）水利局之組織與弊端查治運機、關向爲督辦運河工程局、該局直隸於中央政府而與省政府平行、督辦會辦之地位、均甚隆崇、自改爲江北運河工程處後、該處處長僅能向水利局建議、絶無對外之權力、因該處直隸於水利局、水利局又直隸於建設廳、建設廳又直隸於省政府、故地位與權力、均異常卑下、不特運河工程處無指揮縣政府及命令縣人民之權力、即水利局本身對於縣政府與人民、亦不能直接指揮命令、同時與運河關係最切之各縣縣政府、不但不能命令水利局與運河工程處、並且不能指揮各段工務所、水利局與縣政府文書來往、均用公函、雙方不得省政府命令、無論分工合作、皆不可能、一遇緊急之時水利局因不能召集民夫束手無策縣政府亦因無材料經費、愛莫能援、直至本年七月三十一日、江蘇省政府始發見此弊、乃於第四一二次會議中、議决兩項救濟辦法、一令江北沿運有關各縣縣長會同水利局、督率民衆、盡力保護、一令建廳轉飭水利局、會同各縣縣長督率民衆、共同保隄此項决議案、顯然爲水利局與縣政府不能通力合作之確證、</p>
<p>再查水利局規模之大、用人之多、與積弊之深洵堪驚異、本局之内、自局長處長總工程司副工程司工程司佐理工程司工務員測繪員以至課員辦事員試用辦事員等共計七十一人、所轄江都叚高寶叚淮邳叚三叚工務所、自所長以至雇員、各十一人、計三十三人、工務所之下、共分爲十餘汛、每汛自修守員修守副員以至隊目堡兵、少者十餘人、多者三十餘人、約計不下、四百、人局内上級人員、其工作僅爲文書册籍計畫考核、絶少參與運河工程之實際工作、至於下級人員大都有名無實、甚至因襲從前積習、迄今未除、據建設廳長孫鴻哲及水利局長茅明昇面稱、汛兵向恃屯墾爲生活、並不支薪、自入民國以來、或盜賣所墾之田、或敲詐人民之産、甚至民間耕牛偶在堤上吃草、亦可私自罰金、至於每歲修防之費、大都彼輩分肥、上下相蒙、已非一日據此則河工下級人員不獨害及堤工、並目災及民衆、無事時則營私舞弊無所不爲、有事時則疲癃殘疾、無一足用、該局長對於河工人員、豈無監察考核奬懲黜陟之責今知之而不予嚴懲、一若事不干已也者、縱不必誅其有縱兵殃民之心、亦當責其負姑負養姦之咎、又該局長在其二十年運河防汛工作簡報中云、一再令知各叚所長、轉飭各汛認眞築做、毋任偷减、事後查有丈尺不符、或做未合法之處、均經責令賠修、可見偷减與丈尺不符、及做未合法等舞弊情事、已爲修防中公開之秘密、而爲人民所共見共聞者矣、該局長所司何事、迄今不加懲治、謂非失職而何、又查水利局之職掌、大半爲水利工程、事項而三叚工務所所長所習者皆爲土木工程、並無一專習水利工程者、其於河工素無相當經騐、故對於出險時之搶險、及出險後之堵塞皆束手無策、即此一端亦可證明水利局長之用人不當矣、</p>
<p>（三）春修夏防之疏忽查運河春修、原爲防險之預備、故積土積石積柴、爲春修之最要工程、此次查勘河堤、見高郵以下積土全無、而寳應淮安一帶、雖存有積土、然已多半供築路之用、所餘無幾、而且此項積土、至少爲五年前之物、因土中樹木高者二丈有餘、由此可見水利局今年雖開支五萬餘元之春修費、然對於積土工程、則完全未做、故當七八兩月河水陡漲急於搶險之時、數百里長堤同時缺土、蔴袋蒲包亦同時告罄貽誤河工、實非淺鮮、至於夏防及搶險工作、由水利局自做者、不及十之三四、由各縣縣政府及二十五路軍帮同築做者、實超過太半、有水利局之藍色圖可證、（附圖二紙）又據各縣縣長面稱、淮安加子埝八十餘里、僅用洋三萬餘元、寳應加子埝亦數十里、僅用洋五千餘元、淮陰高郵爲數尤少、而水利局之夏防費、竟開支三十三萬餘元、數目相差、竟如是之鉅、謂爲吞没公欵固無確證、然謂爲浪費公欵則眞百口莫辯矣、當七月間孫鴻哲到工視察時、民衆團體以多備工料爲請、孫厲聲謂此事我能負責、及二次復到巡工、民衆請謁遂拒絶不見、此事高郵縣高會陳主席言時、聲涙俱下、自屬可信、於此可見孫鴻哲之剛愎自用、於人民之建議、絲毫不納、其疏忽隄防、所在多是不僅春修夏防已也、</p>
<p>（四）出險前後河工人員之凟職查本年八月二十五六兩日、雨量之多、風力之大、實所罕見、八月一月間之雨量、爲一零六公厘、而二十五日一日間之雨量、竟爲一零二·三公厘、二十五日之風力、爲五·五次日之風力爲六·三至於水位、却較民國十年爲低、民國十年、御馬頭水誌之最高水位達一丈九尺八寸、本年最高水位、達一丈九尺六寸、無如狂風急雨、相並而來、當此風狂浪急之一殺那間、自非人力所能抵抗、保堤搶險之工作、自是難於實施、然假使河工人員於春修夏防之工程認眞築做、則决口或不至如此之多、加以搶險之前、材料又無充分預備、以致臨事倉猝、無所措施、人民迫於巨災之餘、以决口之責、完全歸咎河工人員雖稍涉苛刻、而事先材</p>

<h3>全市運動會第九日</h3>
<p>余田光獲男單打網球錦標</p>
<p>丨今日棒球决養丨明日給奬</p>
<p>第二屆全市運動會、完美經過、已成尾聲、所餘者棒球錦標一項而已、昨日余田光獲男子單打網球錦標、大會明日下午四時在天后宫橋市商會大禮堂給狀閉幕、</p>

<h3>今日棒球决賽</h3>
<p>下午四時在棒球塲</p>
<p>江灣約翰之棒球循環决賽、今日下午四時在棒球塲舉行、爲大會最後之一幕、</p>
<p>男子單打網球</p>
<h3>余田光得錦標</h3>
<p>决賽直落三勝錢耀彬</p>
<p>丨雙方表演俱佳丨</p>
<p>余田光昨日以六比二、七比五、六比一、直落三瘊賽勝錢耀彬、而得男子單打網球錦標、雙方表演俱較平日生色、可謂满意、</p>
<p>决戰經過</p>
<p>丨耀彬大可勝第二盤丨</p>
<p>第一盤六比二、第三盤六比一、雙方接戰雖烈、然形勢則倒向一面第二盤爭競頗劇烈、比數七比五、第一盤余直取五盤、錢僅得第六第七兩局第二盤錢耀彬曾以三比一佔極優勢、然轉瞬即連失三局、雖努力造四四五五之平手、終失最後兩局而五比七再敗、此盤錢大可得勝而失之、於是第三盤不可收拾、僅得第二局一局、一比六直落三失敗、余得錦標、</p>
<p>雙方擊法</p>
<p>丨余錢俱佳余勝錢一籌丨</p>
<p>昨日兩人之表演、悉較平日爲佳、用盡全副精力决鬥、雙方皆底線重力長抽、鮮見上網、論長抽余平穩勝錢、而余之對角東西聲擊、使錢乏於奔命而不能應付、此亦勝負原因、錢曾於第二盤開始時、有機昂上網、果勝三局、然其攔殺之錯誤而欠把握、常反使球觸網、失分亦累累、錢之開球雙錯誤計共六七次之多、第一盤即因此奉送、至於余之正反手抽擊昨日可謂得意之至、完美非凡、錢則尚欠深長、膽小故、常高底線尚有三四尺、不能制人死命、力量之重、則雙方俱已竭盡矣、</p>

<p>女子五子米、參加者八人、到場比賽者四人、到達終點、朱瑞英胡月英王佑芳三女士、先後相差極微、可見况爭之烈、查男子田徑賽中、公安局未嘗得分、（長官組除外）朱女士可謂效忠團體而稍吐一口氣矣、</p>
<p>長官百米、加入比賽者、有俞鴻鈞秘書長、及潘公展陳希曾胡鴻基沈君怡朱炎之徐佩璜六局長、當站在出發綫上、磨拳擦掌之時、張市長爲之說明規則指示方法、井井有、條迨令下出發、俞秘書長突飛而前、惜未穿跑鞋在二十米處、滑倒地上、躍起續跑、尚獲第四、堪稱健者</p>

<p>參加拔河比賽者、衛生敎育土地公安四局、分兩次預賽敎育對衛生、敎育勝、土地對公安、土地勝、於是敎育與土地、得决賽之權、賽法、每局出六選手地上畫一八尺距離之鴻溝、賽員分執巨綆之兩端、聞令各合力曳拉、凡能使對力越過鴻溝者爲勝</p>
<p>（三）籃球决賽</p>
<p>社會局勝市政府三九比一九</p>
<p>鐘鳴二下、兩方戰士、整裝上塲各懷必勝之志市府宗孝杰彭善增、尤稱驍勇、惟全軍聨絡、似遜社會局一籌、故分數之累進市府常居於後、上半時、十七七比十一、市府小挫、下半時、社會局鏖戰更酣、鄭志賢·鈕因楚·潘壽恒·三員虎將、左馳右騁、鋭不可當、分數亦遂遠駕於市府之上、二十二對八、合計戰績、成三九比十九、社會局奪得錦標、裁判員張龍海、監察員倪土明、</p>

<h3>林邱江應出席全運會（瞭）</h3>
<p>丨爲本市爭光榮丨爲網球界謀進步</p>
<p>林寳華邱飛海、江道章、網球界之第一流選手也、本市擁有林邱江三位選手、將來全運會網球錦標、似有相當把握、但據接近林江者言、林已應聘全運會之請、任網球裁判、將來不代表本市參加比賽、江則亦以特别情形或不能前去首都、如此消息、實令人聞之、炭火加冰也、但記以者爲林江應代表本市、不應有此異議、敢述理由如左、</p>
<p>（一）林邱江三君在中國網球界最負盛譽、技術如何、毋庸麕者介紹、但八届遠東運動會時、由日菲選手中奪下網球錦標林江更遠渡重洋、赴美參加台維思杯比賽、如此盛事、即入各省市選手以及全國人士之心、此番全運會、大好機會、無不欲藉此一覩林邱江之風彩、林江如不去、實有負全國人士之希望、</p>
<p>（二）林江如遠在異域、不能參加比賽、亦無可奈何、今滬寗相距不遠七小時路程耳、如訂詞不去、人將發各種議論、「驕也」「怕也」均於林江不利、、且旣能前去擔任裁判、爲何不前去比賽、徒令人多此猜測耳、</p>
<p>（三）中國網球一端、實幼稚不堪、此番全運會、集各省市之英俊、林邱江更應參加比賽、作技術上之表演、使各省市選手飽學而回、此是提倡全國運動會之本旨、亦先進者應有之責任也、</p>
<p>（四）凡人屬於一團體、對於此團體應有忠心、對於團體生活亦應共同維持、今上海市、擬選最優良之選手、代表本市、參加全運比賽、在被選之人、如無特别事故、理應有團體精神、共同前去、不應推諉、</p>
<p>（五）新嘉坡網球選手林望蘇、林約翰等、實力雄厚、爲本市奪標之勁敵、苟林江不去致失錦標、林江將負其責任、雖錦標得失、無甚關係、但有人才而不用、或不戰而却實非體育上應有之精神也、</p>
<p>草地網球會</p>
<h3>林邱保持公開雙打錦標</h3>
<p>昨力戰五盤勝卡那凡洛惠特</p>
<p>高級單打一週德孚勝江道章</p>
<p>林寶華邱飛海昨日於一比二失勢後、仍以三比二勝卡那凡洛及惠特、繼續保持上海草地網球會之公開雙打錦標觀者莫不稱慶、同時德孚與江道章先作高級單打第一週賽、德孚以直落三勝、</p>
<h3>德孚勝江道章</h3>
<p>丨高級單打第一週丨</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>德孚六比四江道章</p>
<p>六比一</p>
<p>江道章雖敗不差　江昨日雖敗、比數接近異常、第一盤曾以三比二、及四比三佔先、終以連失三局、而失第一盤、第二盤連失三局、又挽回三局、再成四比四、四比六再敗、第三盤亦得一局未曾全軍覆没、江昨日之對角長抽、準而有力、空中球對打及高球、亦把握大增、一除往日之荒亂、博得彩聲不少、第三盤則似精力已盡、然以此成績而敗於德孚、洵屬不易矣、</p>
<p>下星期末之劇戰　高級單打、聞定下星期六舉行複賽、星期日高初級單打同時决賽、高單打之複賽、不外林寶華對德孚、及邱飛海對俵積雄、四雄相遇、又是球迷之眼福、</p>
<p>林邱保持錦標</p>
<p>丨大亂不慌是以得勝丨</p>
<p>林寳華邱飛海六比三三比六二比六六比二六比二卡那凡洛惠特</p>
<p>林邱直下五局之威風　上場頗</p>
<p>林邱一搭一擋、威風非凡卡惠全非其敵手、林開球即得一局、復一下而連得五局、以此形勢羣以爲必直落三、豈知不然林邱恐對方難堪、忽放任一局、繼而惠特突然生色一而再、再而三、追上三局林邱見事不佳、乃殮然以六比三勝第一盤、</p>
<p>印飛海减色後之風波　第二盤忽形勢大變、邱飛海竟、不得意之至、對角抽無一次得志、出界者甚多、攔殺亦時網觸、於是卡惠造三三和局後、一連串共得七局、換言之林邱連失七局、即卡惠以六比三勝第二盤、第三盤四比○佔先、</p>
<p>卡那凡洛殺球之厲害　第三盤之第五局、林邱於不少平數後方勝才能四比一、狀卡惠乘勢大肄進攻、雙關把住、攔住猛殺、林邱一籌莫展、竟一蹶而不能振、林邱於是二比六再大敗第三盤</p>
<p>大亂不慌否極而泰來　至此林邱已處於岌岌之境、邱林略作練習重行登場、四人各勝發球之局、二比二、林邱小心異常、果然接連而勝五局、第四盤前以比二得勝、挽回成二比二、第五盤亦勝一局、惠特至此漸現不支之狀、卡那凡洛雖仍容光煥發孤掌難鳴、第四盤林邱之勝、對方之减色而已最後决賽一盤邱惠林開球之三局、俱偦邱林、勝勢乃定六比二終林邱三比二保持錦標、末二局雙方表演空中球不少精彩、</p>
<p>林寳華卡那凡洛出色　昨日表演林寳華完全恢復常態、堪稱满意、邱飛海則大差、卡惠大逞、過即在、此雙打聖手卡那凡洛、勇冠全場、進退有方、攔殺大施威風、對角擊隙俱顧手、惜惠特稍差而不善致、敗爲之可惜、</p>

<p>第二交大十七分</p>
<p>第三復旦十四分</p>
<p>第四中公二分</p>
<p>丨二百米胸游平等全國紀錄錄丨</p>
<p>日昨爲江大游泳會第二日、徐家匯游泳池旁、男女人士蒞塲參觀者不下四百餘人、時當日光融融、自天　直射而下、满地生春色、二時正鐘、比賽開始、各項競爭、均頗緊急、觀衆之興味旣濃、賽員之精神尤佳、比賽結果、曁南男子組共得三十三分、女子組共得十三分、第二届男女錦標、均由該校所獲、茲附比賽經過情形如左、</p>
<h3>比賽述要</h3>
<p>五十米自由式得决賽權者、共計五人、游至二十五米轉彎時、先後難分、直至終點之際、練顯南以一尺之遥、前出尹衍鈞、遂獲第一、練君雖善泳、然轉彎之動作殊緩、實美中之不足、</p>
<p>四百米自由式　共計來回十六次、前百米中鄭貴章及尹衍鈞兩人前導、旋見林潮源努力加鞭、至十三次來回時、已超過鄭尹而列第一、隨後凌崇舉亦着着爭光、變成第二、直至終點爲止、第三名尹君最後五十米中、盡力划游、致上岸時、氣促　臥地上、競爭之烈、可以想見矣、</p>
<p>百米仰游　自始至終、易啟祥與曹松萬並駕齊驅、、易君用雙臂同划曹尹用單臂交換划、勝負之分别僅於最後數米中始决定</p>
<p>千五百米自由式　計五人决賽、共計來回須六十次、在前十四次中、林潮源與鄭貴章互相比肩而游、黄大柱追隨兩人之後至二十六次時、黄君被徐鎭芳趕上、變成第四、至二十八次中、復被易啟祥越過、遂落後、成最後一名直至五十次中、鄭君不過居林君之前二米、然至終點時、已超出林君二十五米、林君達到目的時、徐鎭芳尚差百二十餘米、徐君達到時、又在易君前二十米、此即此項比賽經過情形之大概　　二百米胸游　自鳴槍起賽、始由凌崇舉一人先導、蓋凌君之蛙色踢腿、已得其中之奧妙每一踢腿、均能力大而致遠、使其他賽員均望水花而莫及、故竟能以三分二十八秒之時間平等馬智輝於第八屆逺東預選所保持之全國最高紀錄、實屬難能可貴願凌君更加努力百尺竿頭、更進一步鍾朗璇少年英才、竟能爭得第二席、殊屬可慶、第三符開先游時動作過速故難得良好之成績、倘能改去此點、時間定可減少、、望符君加意焉</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋大談薈</p>
<h3>活吃丈夫（下）</h3>
<p>我抱了一個好奇心，要看看第二個丈夫介紹給一個新近受精的雌螳螂要受何等待遇。調查的結果令人驚悸。雌螳螂對於食色兩欲是不會满足的。不論下蛋與否，伊休息一忽兒，久暫各個不等，更能接待第二個丈夫並同第一個一樣把他吃掉。第三個接上來，盡了生命之責，是被吃掉，踪跡毫無。第四個的命運也是這樣。在兩個星期之内，我親見同一的雌螳螂吃掉七個家子公，伊歡迎他們投入伊的懷抱呌每一個人都拿生命來繳付愛情之代價。</p>
<p>「人總以爲在大自然裏雄的可以自由逃避，其實不然。我在那兒親眼看見一對配偶幹出這種可怖的勾當。那雄的，全副精神都用於盡他的天職，緊緊把雌的抱着。可是他已經没有頭，連頸子也没有，身體也不完全。那雌的，嘴兒伸過脖子，正在那兒吃伊没有吃完的温柔的情人咧，······」</p>
<p>我們有一位朋友的夫人很厲害。他當伊的面不敢說什麽，背後常喊伊爲雌老虎。我勸他達觀些，便把螳螂的家庭生活講給他聽，他說··「我果然是比上不足，比下有餘了。」</p>
<p>諸位若不信法勃耳的話，可以養些螳螂試看。何必要信他的話呢？最好是親自試一試吧。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>制造假眼睛的專家英國有一種奇怪的職業。便是專門製造假眼睛。這一家假眼睛店設在倫敦新奧克斯福街。NewOxforStreet開業以來。已歷一百五十年之久由子子孫。孫傳襲下來。現在任經理的。是那當初創辦人的玄孫。</p>
<p>這一家店中所製造的假眼睛。極神化自然之致。看上去栩栩欲活的。好像是眞的一樣。拍在照片中。一些也看不出是假造的眼睛。因爲那眼睛上的細筋。也一一仿製。并且能使瞳人放大縮小。這樣的技術。眞是鬼斧神工啊。</p>
<p>近來他們得了幾筆特别的生意。原來非洲與東方有幾個信神之國。都來定製假眼睛。以嵌在他們所崇拜的偶像上。便愈覺得神采煥發起來。那些武勇的神像。需要一雙尖鋭而凶猛的眼睛。而慈悲的神像。却需要一雙温柔而和藹的眼睛。他們都能做得盡善盡美。</p>
<h3>堅苦卓絶之朱執信</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>朱執信。原名大符。漸之蕭山人其祖寓粤。遂成番遇捕屬。是革命運動中最熱烈之實行家。幼承家學。詩詞文賦。悉有根柢。弱冠游學扶桑。於英日文學。均有特長。時孫總理在日。組織同盟會。因與汪精衞有戚誼。共同加盟。努力革命運動。辛亥三月二十九之役。廣州起事。朱臨時趕到。扯去長衫下半截。成短衣形。領得手槍。與諸同志進攻督署。事敗受</p>
<p>傷。逃於香港旋又冒險間關入香山。率領民軍運動舉事以寒民賊之心。</p>
<p>民國成立。朱努力於粤省政治之建設并任綏靖司令。地方又安。民二癸丑二次革命。朱參與屠龍之役。贊翊孫總理組織中華革命黨。民六隨孫總理返粤。致力政治軍事。尋回滬主編建設雜誌。厥後孫總理北伐。率師入桂。朱亦隨往。旋於虎門被敵人謀剌。因而殉難時民九九月二十一日也。年僅三十有六耳。</p>
<p>朱氏一生。堅苦卓絶。守正不阿。性情率直疾惡如仇。黨中同志。莫不敬畏。居恒衣履不整。指甲甚長。同志中有勸其剪去者。輙怒目相視。某日孫總理見其甲縫藏垢甚多。執剪而謂朱曰。執信。若指甲如許之長。殊不雅觀。忙於著述。無暇剪除耶。吾當爲子剪之。朱俛首從命。莫敢反抗。又朱在東京時。同志中多已去辮易服。朱獨反是。不知者疑其另有作用。其激烈者。且謂其爲漢奸。殊不知朱氏另有作用。以去辮易服回國從事革命。招人注意。行動不便故仍留之。當時曾謂反對者曰。燕雀豈知鴻鵠志實際革命。與辮髮無關。大丈夫須務其達者大者。近視之輩。則枝節是務。吾不取焉。味其言。可知朱氏之爲何如人矣。</p>
<p>朱逝世後同志爲編朱執信集。其中「耶穌是什麽東西」一篇年來反基督敎運動者。恒視爲宣傳藍本。廣州之執信學校。是紀念朱氏而立。成績甚著也。</p>
<h3>漢口倖保之一方乾士</h3>
<p>— 理</p>
<p>今歲江漢泛濫。水平之高。爲海關自有紀錄以來所未見。說者以爲如此水勢。挾其萬鈞之力。奔騰而來。自非人力所能抵禦。宜乎堤破埝摧。武漢三鎭。先後淹没。鄂東十數縣。盡成澤國。幾幾回復雲夢故狀據漢友函述。漢口西北隅橋口區之宗關濱臨襄水。地形素稱低窪。上海茂福申三新總公司分設申新四廠福新五廠於此當民國十五年秋。武漢曾罹大水。兩廠以新設。未諳地勢。首先被淹。嗣即築有廠堤以爲之防。本年兩廠經理李君國偉。鑒於臘底年初之大雪。伏中之霪雨。决其必有大水。七月間即召集附近人民。從事預防。由廠酌貼欵項。防線長至二十餘里。七月二十七日以後。襄水泛濫。遂免於難。其時水平已較光緒元年最高紀錄高出五分。一般心理。方謂水位已躋極巓。不無苟安之念。李君獨鑒於大堤之岌岌。廠堤之未高。急就原有廠堤及宗關市街臨時所築之土堆加高加闊。銜成一氣。包容宗關全市周長四里餘。並隨外間水位。時時加高。堤頂幾與民居屋簷相齊。迨八月五日後。川水汹湧下注。江漢暴漲。迄十九日達於最高點。較前此最高紀錄。更高出三尺六寸。皇經堂堤遂告潰决。張公堤亦過水。襄水奔突横流。四處漫溢。獨宗關一隅。以有新堤保障。得免浸灌。然自是新堤滲水。常有坍塌之虞危急萬狀。李君日夜督率廠中同事工友廢食廢寢。併力搶救。取土不及。即以廢花麥粉堵塞。如此二十餘日險期方過。竟保無恙。此時漢鎭全没。而是處獨能保持一方里之乾士。避災及趕市者紛集。視若洞天福地。現兩廠仍照常開工。即附近失業工人。亦因得築堤工資。生活勉可</p>

<p>錢能訓周樹模</p>
<p>錢幹丞（能訓）。浙江嘉善人。周少樸（樹模）。湖北天門人。能訓丙戌進士。樹模已丑進士。先後授編修爲御史。二人皆方面大耳。樹模貌尤豐腴並有天官之目。受知於徐鞠人（世昌）。當清季遼東新建行省。世昌奉詔爲總督。於署内設承宣諮議兩廳。薦樹模任左參贊。兼領承宣廳事。能訓任右參贊。兼領諮議廳事。凡事諮商而後行。所謂倚若左右手也。世昌旣内移郵傳部。樹模已擢黑龍江巡撫。所遺左參贊。奉天巡撫唐少川（紹儀）薦梁如浩代之。梁疎懶不治事。事權盡操能訓手。同僚側目。世昌將入京。語能訓曰。吾行矣。清弼乃故交。子宜善事之。清弼錫良字。繼世昌之任者也。良甫受事。睹能訓獨攬大權。將薄懲之。猶豫未决。幕客某曰。東海方與密勿。勢不可侮。孰若疏請裁缺。避排擠之名。收黷免之效。是能訓不去而去矣。良頷首。如計而行。詔准之。爲世昌所聞。不悅曰。吾同年錢幹丞。固有功於遼東新政者。清弼竟不能相容。儻果有劣蹟。罷其職可耳並缺而裁之誠予人難堪吾方在位而爲疆吏者乃如此不論是非功罪則爲政尚堪問耶。其時順天府府丞缺。出世昌力繩能訓之才於奕劻。交薦於朝。遂獲簡授。擢陜西布政使。甫蒞任。護巡撫。辛亥之變。能訓持刄自戕。遇救。易服至京師。或謂能訓裁缺入覲。不蒙召見世昌再入樞府。爲運動久之。始授陜西藩司。又曰。其兄明訓。於辛亥權津海道。非也明。訓由部曹外簡津海關道。戊申殁於任。代者粤人蔡紹基。於辛亥大局鼎沸之時稱疾退。直督陳筱石（夔龍）檄候補道幕客沈銘昌權斯缺。乃實事也。項城當國。於甲寅間廢國務院。仿唐制建置政事堂。起世昌爲國。務卿楊士琦爲左丞。右丞初卽梁敦彦。敦彦以世昌士琦交薦筦交通部。一日。項城顧世昌曰。左右丞。宰輔之位也。非資深才裕者莫理。相國於意云何。（項城以相國稱世昌。於是相國之名大著。）世昌知恉。對曰。能訓明敏。足膺艱鉅。項城沉思半晌曰。幹丞正貳内部。遽預樞要。不越次躐等耶。世昌復曰然則。少樸何如。項城曰。少樸方正。已虚平政院長一席待之矣。幹丞於相國爲同年。（世昌亦丙戍進士）杏城爲婣家。兩漢方興。三蘇並起。雖資望稍遜。宜爲事擇人。予始念竟末及此。世昌退而告能訓曰事諧矣。吾子於項城未嘗一日共事。右丞雖尊。不宜越俎。或可久於其位。子毋忽。能訓唯唯樹模初得報。以爲右丞己内定。頗露發奮意令下。任平政院院長。疑能訓私乞世昌攫其位。殊不懌。世昌爲解釋久之。乃已</p>
<p>維持。故其地雖難民麕集。而閭閻安堵。日用之品。毫不缺乏。以視彼三鎭人士之日困於水中者。其苦樂何啻有霄壤之别。聞兩廠築堤費用。約耗四萬餘金。而貨物機件。均無損失。漢陽有五豐麵粉廠者。資本祇及福新五分之一。因不戒於水。損失至十萬餘元。宗關爲漢口工業區域。工廠十數家。居民二萬餘人。設無新堤之保障。則洪水所浸。物質上之損失將不知其幾許。今李君倡導築堤。卒能保全一隅。洵可謂功在地方者矣。又聞紗廠聨合會有某君者。家在泰縣。亦預料今秋將有大水。函囑家中早築隄防。厥後運水泛濫。而某君所居之一村。獨免湮没是亦足與宗關之保全。東西輝映。堪爲治水者昭鑒。也。惜某君姓氏。以告者不能相憶。無從探知。逆料今次全國水災中。類此者當不止一二事以無表彰之者遂多不聞於世然於此亦可見凡事在於人爲此次空前浩刦苟當事者能預爲防範則水勢縱大。亦必能保全不少。吁曲突移薪爲多事。焦頭爛額乃上客。今古一轍。言念及此。能毋慨歎於無竊耶</p>
<p>文藝界消息剡谿徐哲身氏。向設養花軒小說編輯社於霞飛路二零八號。近因外埠讀者紛。紛致信徐氏。要求創設一小說函授社。以資學習。已於日前移寓於吕班路二九八號内四號洋房。設立養化軒小說函授社。印有詳細社　。函索即寄云</p>

<h3>丈夫的妻子（十九）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>愛情的出發點與終止點，是和蛛絲完全一樣，一定要有一個可以黏住的對方，才能連繫，否則飄在空中一無着落，是得不到緊張，維繫，終於無用。李夫人失了丈夫的愛，也正和浮絲一般，只要遇到有一個認爲可以維繫好愛情的對方，伊便想黏住了。但是伊也常常警惕自已，不要做出一件社會上認爲不名譽的事來，一方面丢自己的醜，一方面也使李先生丢臉，同時也毁損了陳先生的名譽。伊的寸心，比任何人都難過，伊是眞在愛陳先生，却又瞻顧徘徊，却没有勇敢前進；伊怨恨着丈夫，又希望他回頭；伊想與陳先生疏淡些，但是又可憐陳先生的處境，能帮助他的事，總不知不覺地自願去帮他做；伊不知道將來的命運是怎樣，更不知道陳先生是不是愛伊，陳夫人將來會不會和陳先生賴婚？伊又幻想到萬一陳先生假使很顯明的向伊表示愛心，應該如何對付？這些都在伊爲陳先生整理衣服時候心中起伏的思潮，伊覺得自已臉上有些發燒，頭裏也有些眩暈，伊便坐了下來，伏在茶几上休息一會。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？」陳先生走過去很懇切地問。</p>
<p>「覺得有些頭暈吧了，這是我常有的事，一會兒便好。」李夫人勉强抬起頭來。</p>
<p>陳先生去把冷水浸了毛巾，覆在伊額角上，一手托住了伊的後頸說··「你躺一會吧！」陳夫人眞的在沙發上躺了下來·李先生給伊脱了鞋子，讓伊躺得舒服一些</p>
<p>「你太辛苦了，你該自已保重些身體呢。」陳先生站在伊身旁，像熱心的看護婦一般</p>
<p>伊閉着眼，不說什麽，伊只覺得這樣的温存，和丈夫結婚以後從來不曾有過的；但是伊很漸愧，伊竟受到了丈夫的朋友的温存，同時也很满意與甜適，伊忘却了這樣的情形，是一種瓜田李下，被第三人瞧見，是會變化出無數希奇古怪的說話，給人當作故事來講的。伊把頭上覆的冷巾取下，要陳先生再浸了冷水重又覆上了，伊又要陳先生斟了一小杯冷茶，由陳先生喂着伊喝了。</p>

<h3>The South Manchuria Region Tragically Devastated by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Set Fire to Changchun and Massacre Officials and Civilians</p>
<p>Huludao, Lianshan Bay, and Other Places Continually Occupied</p>
<p>Central Government Determines to Lower the National Flag at Half-Mast on the 23rd to Express Mourning</p>
<h3>Central Government Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Guangdong Agrees to Ceasefire and Resist Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a temporary discussion meeting at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Zhu Peide, Wu Jingheng, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, Fang Juehui, Zhang Daofan, Zhu Jiahua, and Wang Zhengting attended.

(20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM on the 20th, the Central Standing Committee met. The Minister of Foreign Affairs reported that Changchun, Yingkou, Xinmin, and other places had been occupied one after another, which was a pre-determined plan by the Japanese side. The committee members believed that they relied on their strength and arrogance, while we relied on reason; they used military force as the vanguard of diplomacy, while we used negotiations as the last resort. In the face of military force, we could only show weakness in fact; in the face of reason, we could only hold firm to our determination. Therefore, we could retreat in the face of military force, but we would never relax negotiations. Roughly speaking, that was the situation. It was then decided to lodge a formal protest with Japan on the one hand, and submit the matter to the League of Nations and notify the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, asking them to uphold justice. During the meeting, Wu Tiecheng relayed a reply from Guangdong, agreeing to ceasefire and resist aggression, but with one important condition. The Central Committee members felt that since Chiang had not returned to Nanjing, it was not appropriate to make a complete decision on everything, but only on the issue of Japanese troop invasion, which was of primary importance. (20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News of the Liaoning Incident was first received in Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the 19th. Someone immediately inquired about it with Dai Chuanxian. Dai said that there might be conflicts, but they were unlikely to be serious. By 5:00 PM on the 19th, a telegram from the consulate in Nagasaki arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After Zhang Xueliang's telegram arrived at 7:00 PM, an emergency meeting of the Central Standing Committee was convened. Some advocated breaking off diplomatic relations, while others advocated bringing the matter to the League of Nations. As a result, no decision was made because the true picture was not yet completely clear. In the afternoon of the 19th, Lin, a member of the Japanese embassy, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify them of the Liaoning Incident, saying that it was a local conflict between Chinese and Japanese soldiers and civilians, and that he deeply believed that it would not be serious. He said that the Japanese government had no hostile intentions towards China. Wu Tiecheng telegraphed a report at 11:00 PM on the 19th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shi Zhaoji at the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Moves a Resolution on the Liaoning Incident</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Reads a Statement</p>
<p>Obstructing Shi Zhaoji's Speech</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations new council meeting this afternoon, the chairman, Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux, formally led the assumption of duties. Chinese council member Shi Zhaoji expressed his thanks for the welcoming remarks made by the chairman and said that China has always supported the League of Nations and will actively cooperate in the council in the future. After the ceremony, as Councilor Shi was about to raise the issue of the Japanese army's atrocities in South Manchuria, Japanese representative Yoshizawa immediately stood up and read a statement, saying that he had not received a report on the events in Shenyang and that what he currently knew was entirely from newspaper accounts. The Japanese delegation has now telegraphed its home government to inquire about the truth and will submit it to the council as soon as it receives an official detailed report. Yoshizawa finally requested that the council not overemphasize what he considered a "local incident," and said that the Japanese government hoped to restore order as soon as possible. Councilor Shi, with a heart full of indignation, stood up and said that he was deeply saddened to hear of the Shenyang incident. He also lacked accurate details, but firmly believed that this incident was definitely not caused by provocation from the Chinese side. He would submit any accurate reports he received in the future to the League of Nations, but for the moment reserved the right to explain China's position in this matter. Chairman Lerroux then stood up and expressed satisfaction with Yoshizawa's statement that Japan would do its best to restore the situation, and said that it was gratifying that both Chinese and Japanese representatives were willing to provide accurate reports as much as possible. The issue of the Sino-Japanese conflict was thus postponed for discussion until Monday, at which time there will be a heated debate between the Chinese and Japanese representatives on the council floor. The Chinese delegation issued a statement tonight, saying that the Japanese military authorities should bear full responsibility for this incident. (Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji told the Associated Press before this afternoon's League of Nations council meeting that he wanted to raise the Shenyang incident immediately. This matter could be handled under Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant.

<h3>Reports on Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Telegrams the League of Nations Requesting Justice</p>
<p>Hoping That the People of the Country Will Maintain Calm</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting met with reporters this afternoon and reported: (1) Regarding the fall of Shenyang, the first official telegram was only received at 5:00 PM last night. A note was immediately sent to the Japanese ambassador based on the telegram. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received official reports from various parties and has submitted a second protest note to Shigemitsu. At the same time, the embassy in Japan was instructed to lodge an urgent protest first. (2) Rumors that Lianshan Bay has been occupied by Japanese troops have not yet been confirmed due to the lack of official telegrams. (3) The people of the country are unusually indignant about this incident. The local order in the Eastern Provinces has been excellent recently, and there has been no opportunity for anyone to send troops. It is truly shocking that this incident has occurred now. After this incident occurred, the responsible personnel in the Central Government are studying how to respond. In terms of foreign affairs, they cannot but appeal to reason, so they have telegraphed the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, stating everything and requesting justice. The Ministry has also telegraphed the staff of the American embassy to contact the League of Nations, hoping that the people of the country will remain calm and that the country will unite in this critical and urgent moment to save the country from disaster.

In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Japanese government, it also specifically telegraphed the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, stating that the Japanese army's actions were unreasonable and reckless, in order to clarify who was the aggressor.

<h3>Telegraph to All Comrades in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Hoping for Sincere Unity to Save the Nation from Ruin</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee urgently telegraphed Gu Xiangqin in Guangzhou on the 19th, forwarding it to all comrades in Guangdong, reporting the situation of the Japanese army's invasion of Liaoning and expressing the hope for sincere unity to jointly save the nation from ruin. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Urgent, to arrive immediately. Gu Xiangqin, Committee Member in Guangzhou, for the consideration of all comrades: Japan's plot to occupy our three eastern provinces and then attempt to conquer our entire country is not something that started today. For decades, all their policies have been focused on this. Our people, both men and women, young and old, all know this, so there is no need to elaborate further. Now, they are taking advantage of our urgent internal troubles, a sudden natural disaster, and widespread famine with countless people dying everywhere, a time when the entire nation is preoccupied with rescuing the dying and healing the wounded. They suddenly deployed heavy troops to occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Kuanchengzi, Goubangzi and other places. The extent of their barbarity and the detailed truth still require further investigation. Such barbaric actions are almost unprecedented in world history. According to the reports received so far, the Japanese South Manchurian Railway garrison troops provoked trouble for no reason at 10 PM on the 18th, blowing up the railway east of Huanggu Village and initiating military action, attacking the garrison troops in Beidaying. Our army adopted a policy of non-resistance. The Japanese soldiers went so far as to break into the barracks, set them on fire, and drive our soldiers out of the camp. At the same time, they used field guns to bombard Beidaying and the arsenal, destroying the mortar depots and occupying the mortar factory. Police stations inside and outside the city were all shot at by Japanese soldiers, and the police officers were driven out. The radio transmitting station was also invaded, and guns and cannons bombarded it incessantly throughout the night. Countless soldiers and civilians stationed in Shenyang were killed. By 6 AM on the 19th, large troops entered the city, occupying all the institutions and detaining our military and political leaders. The whereabouts of Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of Liaoning Province, are unknown. Rong Zhen and his family were detained by the Japanese army at the Japanese army headquarters. Wang Yizhe, the brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, died a martyr. The Japanese army wantonly searched, and the provincial government and arsenal were burned down. Northeast University was also occupied. When the 2nd Division departed for Shenyang, they provoked trouble everywhere along the way, burning and looting in a most appalling manner. When the garrison troops in Beidaying retreated east along the Shenhai Line, they were attacked en route, and even more soldiers and civilians died. In addition to forcibly occupying Shenyang, the Japanese army also dispatched detachments to act freely within the Liaoning territory, disarming generals and police wherever they went, and successively occupying Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, Goubangzi, Kuanchengzi, Liaoyang, and other places. It is also reported that the Japanese navy has occupied our Lianshan Bay, and two divisions of the Japanese army stationed in Korea and the air force stationed in Pyongyang have also been ordered to advance into Liaoning. The atrocities and looting know no bounds. Since receiving the alert, the Central Government, in addition to instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge an urgent protest, convened a temporary emergency meeting at 8 PM on the 19th, and resolved to notify all comrades throughout the country and to inform all compatriots of the following points to jointly face the national crisis: (1) In addition to the red bandits who endanger the survival of the nation, who must be eradicated fundamentally, we must be of one heart and one mind to consolidate the foundation of the country and strengthen the power of the government; (2) All people must be of one mind and strength, working hard on disaster relief and resistance to aggression; (3) Comrades of our party must abandon all their opinions and create a strong unity to serve as an example for national unity. The national crisis is deepening, and the ruin awaits rescue. Sincere unity, it is hoped, will be of one mind. This is telegraphed sincerely, with utmost anticipation.

<h3>Purpose of Japanese Military Action</h3>
<p>Japanese Government's Negotiation Policy</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Kwantung Government's Position</p>
<p>Dalian: Tsukamoto, the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, returned to his post yesterday and immediately held important discussions with the heads of the Internal Affairs Bureau, the Police Affairs Bureau, the Foreign Affairs Section, and others regarding the Kwantung Government's attitude towards the Manchurian Incident. They all advocated continuing the occupation pending the resolution of various pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia. The following demands were proposed to the Chinese side: (1) Expanding the scope of Japanese judicial power in South Manchuria; (1) Ensuring various vested rights, expanding police administrative and punitive powers to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents; (1) The South Manchurian Railway parallel line should be jointly operated by China and Japan; (1) Constructing the Jihui Railway; (1) Enforcing tariff agreement principles. (Telegraphic Communication Society Telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's policy for resolving the Manchurian Incident is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese army's military action is for self-defense.</p>
<p>(1) Post-incident negotiations should be resolved locally, without dealing with the central government.</p>
<p>(1) Resolution should be negotiated separately between Japan and the Northeast, disregarding the opinions of third countries.</p>
<p>(1) This is a sudden incident and will be negotiated separately from various pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia. (Telegraphic Communication Society Telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Within the last twenty-four hours, official circles here seem to have slightly changed their views on the Manchurian Incident. They are gradually believing that the actions taken by the Japanese army were actually the result of some impetuous lower-ranking officers flexing their muscles, as these people were dissatisfied with the policies of higher-ranking officers on the Nakamura Incident, considering them too weak. Previously, a few days ago, news came from Shenyang that Rong Zhen, the Chief of Staff of the Northeast Army, had informed the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang that it had been found that Nakamura was killed by soldiers under a certain military officer, and it was also reported that a cavalry team had been dispatched to arrest eleven people, including a certain military officer, who were suspected of being directly related to the case. Therefore, outsiders generally believed that since the perpetrators had been punished, the Japanese authorities should be satisfied and would not have any other demands. When lower-ranking officers heard this news, they were greatly angered and took independent action. Both China and Japan had been accumulating suppressed feelings of excitement and dissatisfaction due to the repeated incidents in recent times. This was actually triggered by irresponsible actions, which gradually intensified and eventually led to this unfortunate incident. Today, official reports received here state that Shenyang is peaceful, but the overall situation cannot yet allow for the complete return of the city to China. The Japanese government today received a serious protest from the Nanjing government, in which Japan was accused of disregarding the Kellogg-Briand Pact and was asked to immediately withdraw the Japanese troops who had forcibly occupied Chinese territory. It is expected that the Japanese reply will be issued tomorrow, and the content is unknown. Although today is Sunday, the authorities are still holding important meetings, one of which is a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. It is now believed that the two are considering proposals that could help to resolve the situation peacefully. (Reuters Telegram from the 20th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Brutal Acts of the Japanese Army That Oppress the World</h3>
<p>The atrocities of the Japanese army in our Northeast continue to escalate even to this day. The headquarters of the Kwantung Army has already moved into Shenyang. Yingkou, Changchun, Andong, Liaoyang, Yanbian and other places have also been occupied. Our country is maintaining calm and adopting no resistance at all. However, Japanese troops coming from Korea are still being dispatched one after another. The Japanese naval landing force in Qingdao is also landing in arms, preparing to provoke. The hideous face of these imperialists who betray justice and violate international law has now been fully exposed, and should be seen by all countries in the world.</p>
<p>The Japanese brutality this time has directly inflicted trauma on our country, and indirectly challenged the United States and Soviet Russia. This is by no means a simple issue between China and Japan. We have already cited the recent statements of the Japanese government and opposition yesterday and elaborated on them. In fact, the Japanese intention goes beyond this, and is actually openly challenging the world, intentionally triggering war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that since the First World War, the center of the world has shifted to the Pacific. It is also universally acknowledged that the so-called Far Eastern problem is focused on the China issue. Our vast Northeast plain has, in fact, become the source of Far Eastern disputes over the years, so some people directly refer to it as the Balkans of the East. After the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese planted a deep-rooted force in our Northeast, and taking advantage of the opportunity of the European War, they further coerced us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands with the ultimatum, infinitely expanding their rights and interests. Their meticulous planning always aimed to realize their "Meiji legacy of conquering Manchuria and Mongolia," in order to conquer East Asia and dominate the world. Tanaka Giichi once said, "If you want to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China." He clearly regarded himself as the Germany before the European War. Therefore, this brutality is actually a planned attempt by the Japanese to stir up huge waves in the Eastern Balkans and light the fuse of war in the Pacific. In essence, the "Germany of the East" has now thrown a gauntlet to the world. Otherwise, even if, as the Japanese claim, the use of force was initiated by our army digging up the South Manchurian Railway, why not show concrete evidence to the public and resolve it properly through diplomatic means? Instead, they suddenly launched a violent attack, attacking without a declaration of war. Moreover, the Chinese army has already completely withdrawn from all the places attacked by the Japanese army without resistance. Why is it necessary to mobilize troops and actively wage war? Those with clear eyes should share the view that they are indulging in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, sparing no expense in military expansion, and following in the footsteps of Germany before the European War. Germany has already been subject to the final judgment of justice and righteousness. How will the nations that uphold justice and peace now deal with Japan, which is succeeding Germany?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if the Japanese trampling on our Northeast is not related to the world, our country is now newly afflicted by floods, and we are unable to defend ourselves. If the Japanese take advantage of our difficulties to seize our Northeast mainland, then the ambitious Japanese will be like a tiger with wings, taking the coal of Fushun, the iron of Anshan, and the accumulated grain, using the rich resources of our Northeast, and competing with the capital of the United States, the Soviet Union, and even the world. This is inevitable. Tanaka Giichi also said, "In that case, we will have sufficient food and raw materials in wartime. Even if the United States has a large navy, China has a large army, and Red Russia has a large number of soldiers, they will ultimately be no match for us." Not only the United States, not only China and Red Russia, but if a tiger grows wings, how can the countries of the world deal with it?</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese military aggression against us this time is indeed a matter of life and death for our country, and it is also a serious problem for the whole world. A single hair can move the whole body. The horrors of the First World War are still fresh in our minds. Taking advantage of the initial outbreak of this disaster, all peace-loving countries in the world should immediately impose effective sanctions.</p>
<p>Half of the Chinese people are drowning in water, enduring death and waiting for rescue, and still have the strength to resist violence. However, the ink on the non-war pact is still fresh, and the meeting of the League of Nations has not yet closed. Both China and Japan have joined the non-war pact and the League of Nations. How should this serious situation be dealt with? The non-war pact alliance should show its supreme power. All Chinese nationals should bear insults and burdens with one heart and wait quietly for the emergency and effective measures of the non-war pact allied countries and the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Japanese Military Clique</p>
<h3>Intending to Seize Power and Overthrow the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a foreigner familiar with the international situation, the Japanese army in Manchuria suddenly took decisive measures to occupy Shenyang and other places while the Chinese and Japanese authorities were seeking a peaceful resolution to various pending issues. This is obviously a move by the Japanese military clique to overthrow the cabinet, so it contains a strong sense of military dictatorship. From the perspective of Japanese politics, the Manchurian Incident will be a major turning point in whether Japanese power will be controlled by military personnel. The Japanese army's reckless actions in Manchuria not only infringe upon China, but also intend to destroy world peace. (Special Telegram from the 20th)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of European and American Public Opinion</h3>
<p>London: The British Observer criticized the Shenyang Incident this morning, saying that the turmoil has now broken out and may enter a tragic path. The Sunday Times said that the great powers are busy dealing with their own difficulties, but they should pay attention to this not-so-dangerous development. It has always been the case that Japan takes the opportunity to implement its own policies when the West has problems. A Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that the US State Department believes that the news currently coming from Shenyang does not provide a basis to consider this action a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. A Reuters dispatch from Berlin stated that German officials do not want to comment on the Sino-Japanese conflict, but German newspapers believe that the situation is serious, and one newspaper expressed the opinion that this matter will endanger world peace. The Berliner Tageblatt said that it is not easy to regard this conflict as a local incident. This matter concerns world peace and presents the League of Nations with a difficult task. The Deutsche Zeitung said that the League of Nations will disappoint as usual and succumb to the fait accompli. A Reuters dispatch from Geneva stated that the League of Nations held an administrative meeting this afternoon, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives each made statements regarding the Shenyang Incident, hoping for a satisfactory and peaceful resolution. Geneva is paying great attention to this matter, because its occurrence coincided with the day when the principle of a convention to consolidate methods of preventing war was announced.

The heads of various departments of the Shandong Provincial Government and the members of the Provincial Party Headquarters held a meeting last night and resolved to maintain law and order in the province to avoid giving the Japanese an excuse to cause trouble for the central government. They also telegraphed this intention to Hu Ruoyu, the mayor of Qingdao, Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, and Liu Zhennian, the commander of the Yantai, asking them to respond calmly based on this policy. Ishida, the Japanese consul in Jinan, visited last night and presented a telegram from his government stating that the unfortunate incident in Manchuria should be resolved by the governments of both countries and requesting protection of Japanese residents. I replied that the safety of Japanese residents and the peace of Shandong Province do not require much consideration. I originally intended to go to Zaozhuang to supervise the troops to suppress bandits, but I have canceled this and reassigned Commander Cao Fulin to command. The Provincial Government believes that there are many Japanese people living along the Jiaoji Railway from Qingdao to Jinan, and there is deep concern that troublemakers will give the Japanese an excuse.

<h3>League of Nations Committee Continues Debate</h3>
<p>Regarding Protective Tariffs</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Guomin News Agency dispatch) The Economic Committee of the League of Nations Assembly continued its discussion on the issue of protective tariffs today. The debate was intense, especially between the representatives of Germany and Switzerland. German representative Dr. Buss protested against the remarks made yesterday by Swiss representative Stuki, who stated that if another country had to dump exports cheaply in Switzerland, Switzerland would have no choice but to adopt tariff protection policies and revise existing tax rates, calling them a veiled threat. Buss also stated that the number of unemployed in Germany is over 4.5 million, which is equivalent to 16 million people, or one-quarter of the entire population, including men, women, and children, who must rely on government subsidies for a living. The situation is even more dire as winter approaches. Furthermore, Germany still has to pay reparations and war debts, which can only be obtained through export trade. If German goods are prohibited from being exported, Germany will be unable to fulfill all its obligations, and so on. The Swiss representative replied that while some countries must rely on exports to fulfill their obligations, Switzerland must take care of both sides. For self-defense, Switzerland has no choice but to resist economic aggression.</p>

<h3>Telegrams</h3>
<p>Beiping Telegram: Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Jiujiang, Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, Mr. Wang Jingwei of Guangdong, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Provincial Chairmen, Commanders-in-Chief, Army Commanders, Division Commanders, Brigade Commanders, various legal entities, newspaper offices, and fellow countrymen across the nation: Internal warfare has been frequent for years, compounded by natural disasters. Japanese imperialists have taken advantage of our predicament and suddenly attacked Shenyang on the 18th night, massacring officials and civilians, forcibly occupying government offices, and starting a war without cause, disregarding public law. There is no national humiliation more intense than this. You, gentlemen, bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the people and are at the forefront of the rise and fall of the nation, defending our border. You cannot shirk your responsibility. Temporary differences in political views should not prevent us from resisting external aggression. Students, being military personnel, have participated in revolutions and cannot bear to see fratricide. To die for the country is our proper place. We hope that you, gentlemen, will heed the principle of mutual dependence, open your hearts with sincerity, rein in your horses at the precipice, and jointly face the national crisis. Let us use our sharp swords together to overcome these difficult times. In this urgent telegram, we cry out in sorrow, hoping for your understanding and compassion. All students of the Army University kowtow.</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegram: To all newspaper offices: Previously, due to the severe floods in various provinces, we established the National Flood Relief Association in this province to raise relief funds and provide monthly assistance. We also reported this by telegram. Now, we have received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, stating that a Flood Relief Association for various provinces should be established at the headquarters, and branches should be established in northern provinces and cities. Existing relief organizations should be renamed accordingly, and actively raise relief funds to be remitted to the headquarters for distribution, etc. Our association has complied and renamed itself the Hebei Provincial Flood Relief Branch on the 12th of this month. Considering that the disaster victims in various places urgently need relief, the province has first advanced 100,000 yuan, which has been remitted to the Deputy Commander's headquarters for transmittal. Apart from continuing to actively solicit donations, we hereby report this by telegram, humbly requesting your attention. The Hebei Provincial Flood Relief Branch kowtows.</p>
<p>Funing Telegram: To all newspaper offices: Only a few days after the previous telegram, due to the full water force, the water level has continued to rise by one to two feet or more, totaling over ten feet. The disaster area has increased by zones two, three, six, eight, and twelve, totaling eleven zones, reaching nine-tenths of the entire county. Although teams have been dispatched to rescue people by boat and shelters have been set up in various areas, many who need rescue remain. Even those who have been rescued are difficult to care for. Apart from the righteous gentleman Hao providing 10,000 yuan in emergency relief, the disaster is severe, the area is vast, and the region is poor, lacking the ability to save itself. We still request that personnel be selected and sent with large sums of money to provide relief in various ways, so that the people who have suffered repeated disasters can be saved. The Funing Relief Branch and the Flood Relief Aftercare Branch kowtow together.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Hydraulic Engineering Society</h3>
<p>Requests the Establishment of a Special Water Affairs Authority</p>
<p>Li Yizhi, President of the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, and Li Shutian, Vice President, yesterday submitted a petition to the National Government, suggesting to unify national hydraulic administration and to establish the central supreme authority in charge of water administration: We hereby state that although our country's water administration is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior, the hydraulic administration of each river basin is, due to special relationships, either under the direct jurisdiction of the National Government, or under the various ministries and commissions, or under the independent administration of the various provinces. The system is already fragmented, and it is difficult to pinpoint accountability. For example, both the Huai River Harnessing Committee and the Guangdong River Management Committee are directly under the National Government. Dredging waterways is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, while agricultural irrigation is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry. The preparatory work for the two major ports in the East and North is jointly handled by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. The only hydraulic institutions directly under the Ministry of Interior are the North China and Taihu committees and the Hunan-Hubei hydrological station. Their functions concerning water conservancy are only focused on the passive prevention of disasters, and there is no special department in charge of water conservancy. Therefore, not only is the organizational system of the central authority in charge fragmented, but the functions of the various ministries and commissions regarding water conservancy are also often conflicting. For example, the Yongding River and Daqing River, within the scope of the North China Water Conservancy Committee, are managed by the Hebei Construction Department, while the Hai River between Tianjin and Dagu is managed by the Hai River Engineering Bureau, which has long been controlled by foreigners. Despite the huge annual expenditures, the siltation has worsened. Last year, the Hai River Rehabilitation Committee, affiliated with the Executive Yuan, was established to focus on superficial engineering. The dredging work of the same Yangtze River waterway is planned by the Yangtze River Waterway Rehabilitation Committee for the Wusong and Hankou sections, while the Haijun Department's hydrographic survey is used for the Tongzhou Estuary section. Recently, the dredging of the Shen Tan shoal at the estuary is being planned by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau. The Yellow River, which has caused the most severe problems for years, and the canal, which is the only waterway in China, are each managed in sections according to administrative regions, resulting in fragmentation and significant harm. The bureaus of water conservancy and river affairs in various provinces are either affiliated with the provincial government or with the construction department, without any standard. This is the general situation of the fragmented water administration system in our country, and it is also the biggest obstacle to the current water conservancy construction. Our country is based on agriculture, and has been for thousands of years. Since the opening of trade and the gradual influence of Westernization, although we have made great efforts to promote industry and commerce, due to the immaturity of science and technology and the lack of both manpower and resources, there have been few achievements in recent decades. The fact that the country can barely sustain itself with an annual deficit of 120 million yuan is largely due to agricultural production. However, in recent years, the entire country is either flooded or scorched. River basins such as the Liao River, Yongding River, Yellow River, Canal, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River are frequently alarmed. People and livestock are swept away, and fields and houses are submerged, while the Shaanxi and Gansu areas are cracked and barren for thousands of miles. Floods and droughts have spread almost throughout the country. The floods in the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces this year are a rare catastrophe in centuries. The loss of agricultural products is estimated to be in the tens of billions, and the number of displaced people is in the hundreds of millions. If we do not make urgent efforts to remedy the situation in terms of water conservancy, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, the people's livelihood will decline and the foundation of the country will be shaken. The importance of water conservancy for the safety and stability of the country is evident. Since the founding of the Republic of China twenty years ago, the country has been plagued by wars, and water conservancy has been increasingly neglected. Although the National Government has promoted construction in recent years, it is often too eager for quick results, forgetting the fundamentals. Aviation and road construction are promoted, striving to decorate the facade, while the water conservancy work that is the lifeline of the country is often neglected. This is because the achievements of water conservancy projects are generally slow and gradual, unlike the rapid results of aviation and road construction. Therefore, each competent authority is left to handle local issues, and when a crisis occurs, each only seeks a solution within its jurisdiction, shifting the burden to its neighbors and only considering the present, without any long-term vision. Water conservancy projects often affect a period of several decades or even centuries, and an area of dozens or even hundreds of counties. Rivers, lakes, and marshes span several provinces, forming an entire river basin. Navigation, transportation, agricultural irrigation, and other aspects all have close relationships. Therefore, the national authority in charge of water conservancy must implement a comprehensive system, centralize power, and make overall plans, taking the river basin as the scope and making overall plans. This cannot be solved by the current administrative regions, sectional management, and local facilities. Our association, being a research group on water conservancy, is holding its first annual meeting in the capital at a time when the national flood situation is serious. After detailed discussions by the members present, it was believed that the strange disaster in the Jiangsu and Anhui regions this year was largely due to the fragmented system and divided powers of our country's water conservancy authorities. In order to remedy the past and prevent the future, it is considered appropriate to establish a supreme authority in charge of water administration at the central level to coordinate the national water administration, and to merge the existing water conservancy authorities according to their respective river basins. This would ensure consistency of power and accountability, and would provide adequate regulation before water disasters and droughts, so as to protect agriculture and consolidate the national foundation. Other types of construction would also have something to rely on and gradually develop. This matter concerns the safety and stability of the country and the welfare of the people, and we dare not avoid overstepping our position or remain silent. Therefore, we have presented our humble opinions and respectfully request your attention, adoption, and implementation. The country will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Water Conservancy Officials</p>
<h3>Neglecting the Investigation of Embankments (Continued)</h3>
<p>(2) The organization and malpractices of the Water Conservancy Bureau The canal management agency was formerly the Directorate General of Canal Works, which was directly under the central government and parallel to the provincial government. The positions of the director and associate director were highly respected. After it was changed to the Jiangbei Canal Works Office, the director of the office could only make suggestions to the Water Conservancy Bureau, and had no external authority. Because the office was directly under the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau was directly under the Construction Department, and the Construction Department was directly under the provincial government, its position and power were extremely low. Not only did the Canal Works Office have no power to command the county government and order the people of the county, but the Water Conservancy Bureau itself could not directly command the county government and the people. At the same time, the county governments, which are most closely related to the canal, could not only not order the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Canal Works Office, but also could not command the various sections of the works department. Correspondence between the Water Conservancy Bureau and the county government was done by official letters, and neither side could cooperate without the orders of the provincial government. In case of emergency, the Water Conservancy Bureau could not summon the laborers and was helpless. The county government was also unable to help due to lack of materials and funds. It was not until July 31 of this year that the Jiangsu Provincial Government discovered this shortcoming, and in the 412th meeting, it decided on two relief measures: one, to order the county magistrates of the counties along the canal in Jiangbei to work with the Water Conservancy Bureau to supervise the people to do their best to protect the canal; and two, to order the Construction Department to instruct the Water Conservancy Bureau to work with the county magistrates to supervise the people to protect the embankment. This resolution clearly proves that the Water Conservancy Bureau and the county government could not cooperate effectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the size of the Water Conservancy Bureau, the number of people employed, and the depth of the accumulated malpractices are appalling. Within the bureau, there are 71 people in total, from the director, the chief engineer, the deputy engineer, the engineer, the assistant engineer, the construction worker, the surveyor, to the clerks, the staff members, and the probationary staff members. The three engineering offices under its jurisdiction, Jiangdu, Gaobao, and Huaipi, each have 11 people from the director to the employees, totaling 33 people. Below the engineering offices, there are more than ten garrisons, each with more than ten or thirty people, from repairmen, deputy repairmen to patrolmen and soldiers, totaling no less than 400 people. The work of the senior staff in the bureau is only for documents, records, plans, and assessments, and rarely participates in the actual work of the canal project. As for the lower-level personnel, most of them are nominal and have not been removed from the previous accumulated practices. According to Sun Hongzhe, the director of the Construction Department, and Mao Mingsheng, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, the garrison soldiers have always relied on reclamation for their livelihood and do not receive salaries. Since the founding of the Republic of China, they have either stolen and sold the reclaimed land or extorted the people's property. Even if a farmer's cattle occasionally graze on the embankment, they can privately fine them. As for the annual maintenance costs, most of them are divided up by these people, deceiving each other. According to this, the lower-level river workers not only harm the embankment works, but also cause disasters to the people. When there is no work, they engage in selfishness and corruption. When there is work, they are tired and disabled, and there is not a single person who is useful. Does the director of the bureau not have the responsibility of supervising, assessing, rewarding, and punishing the river workers? Now he knows it but does not punish them severely, as if it is nothing to do with him. Even if he does not have the heart to condone soldiers harming the people, he should be held responsible for condoning evil. The director of the bureau stated in his twenty-year report on canal flood prevention work that he has repeatedly ordered the directors of each section to instruct each garrison to earnestly build, without allowing any reduction. If there is a discrepancy in the measurements or if the work is not legal, they have been ordered to compensate for the repairs. It can be seen that theft, discrepancy in measurements, and illegal acts are open secrets in the maintenance work and are known to the people. What does the director of the bureau do? Why has he not punished them to this day? How can he not be accused of dereliction of duty? Furthermore, the Water Conservancy Bureau is mainly responsible for water conservancy projects, and the directors of the three engineering offices are all trained in civil engineering, and none of them are trained in water conservancy engineering. They have no corresponding experience in river works, so they are helpless in both the rescue in case of danger and the blocking of breaches after the danger. This alone can prove that the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau is using people improperly.</p>
<p>(3) Negligence in Spring Repair and Summer Defense Canal spring repair was originally a preparation for preventing danger, so accumulating soil, stones, and firewood was the most important project of spring repair. During this inspection of the river embankment, it was seen that there was no accumulated soil below Gaoyou, and in the Bao Ying and Huai An areas, although there was accumulated soil, most of it had been used for road construction, and very little remained. Moreover, this accumulated soil is at least five years old, because the trees in the soil are more than two feet high. From this, it can be seen that although the Water Conservancy Bureau spent more than 50,000 yuan on spring repair this year, it did not do any work on the accumulation of soil. Therefore, when the river water rose sharply in July and August and was anxious to rescue the danger, hundreds of miles of long embankments were short of soil at the same time, and the sacks and bags were also exhausted at the same time, which delayed the river work and was not a small matter. As for the summer defense and rescue work, less than 30% to 40% was done by the Water Conservancy Bureau itself, and more than half was done by the county government and the 25th Route Army. There is a blue map of the Water Conservancy Bureau to prove this. According to the county magistrates, the Huai An Jia Zi embankment is more than 80 li, and only more than 30,000 yuan was used. The Bao Ying Jia Zi embankment is also dozens of li, and only more than 5,000 yuan was used. The amount spent in Huai Yin and Gao You was even less, while the summer defense cost of the Water Conservancy Bureau was more than 330,000 yuan. The difference in numbers is so large. It is not certain that public funds were embezzled, but it is true that public funds were wasted. When Sun Hongzhe came to inspect the work in July, the people's organizations asked for more labor and materials. Sun said sternly that he could be responsible for this matter, and when he came to inspect the work for the second time, he refused to see the people. Chen, the chairman of the Gaoyou County Gao Association, said this with tears, which is credible. From this, it can be seen that Sun Hongzhe is self-willed and does not listen to the suggestions of the people. His negligence in defending against the embankment is not only in the spring repair and summer defense.</p>
<p>(4) The dereliction of duty of the river workers before and after the disaster The amount of rainfall and the force of the wind on August 25 and 26 this year were rare. The rainfall in August was 106 mm, while the rainfall on August 25 was 102.3 mm. The wind force on August 25 was 5.5, and the wind force on the next day was 6.3. As for the water level, it was lower than in the tenth year of the Republic of China. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the highest water level of the Yumatou water mark reached 1 zhang, 9 chi, and 8 cun, and the highest water level this year reached 1 zhang, 9 chi, and 6 cun. However, the strong wind and torrential rain came together, and in that moment of wind and waves, it was impossible for human power to resist, and the work of protecting the embankment and rescuing the danger was difficult to implement. However, if the river workers had earnestly built the spring repair and summer defense projects, the breaches might not have been so many. In addition, there were not enough materials prepared before the rescue, which led to a hasty and unmanaged situation. The people, after the great disaster, blamed the river workers for the breaches, which was a bit harsh, but the material</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Lack of preparation, inadequate rescue efforts; there is truly no way to shirk responsibility. Moreover, what are the duties of river conservancy personnel? How could they, foreseeing the irresistibility of wind and water, simply abandon their posts and flee, leaving everything behind? An investigation has revealed that most of the breaches in the embankments occurred between 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM on August 26th. In the petitions from the people accusing river conservancy personnel of dereliction of duty, it is stated that "In recent days, danger signs have been everywhere. Mao Yisheng, Wu Tongju, Li Zhongqiang, and others did not consider taking measures to protect the embankments. Instead, they hired many steamships, which were moored on the west bank, with fires burning daily, ready to depart at any moment. Mao even sought to evade responsibility early, taking advantage of the heavy winds and waves on the 24th to depart by steamer under some pretext. By the time dangers arose at Hehua Pond and other locations on the 26th, and the people were sounding gongs to warn of the emergency, the river conservancy personnel had all disappeared." According to the results of the investigation and corroborated by the Water Conservancy Bureau's own record of Director Mao's duty dates, it is clearly recorded that the Director returned to the provincial capital on August 25th to report, and from the 27th to the 30th, he went to Tai Bao Changshu Ponds in 　Mountain to inspect the embankment works. Accordingly, during the critical period of embankment danger, even if he had important official business to report to the provincial authorities, he could have sent a special messenger or telegraphed; there was no need to leave his post. When the breach occurred on the 26th, the Director was in the provincial capital and must have received a telegram informing him. Why did he not return to his post to supervise and direct the plugging of the breach? If it is said that the sea dike in 　Mountain was in danger and required his personal inspection, then why did he linger in the provincial capital for two days and also attend the annual meeting of the Science Society? While this may not prove that he intentionally sought to evade responsibility, it does prove that he was ignorant of priorities and that his measures were inappropriate. As for Shao Fuchen, the director of the Jiangdu section works, and Li Zhongqiang, the director of the Gao Bao section works, they both went to the provincial capital on the day after the dike breach (August 27th), leaving the lives and property of millions of people in the lower reaches of the river unattended. What is even more absurd is that, when the dike breached, Li Zhongqiang lost all of the public funds and account books and receipts stored in his office (as detailed in his report), so that the exact use of the 120,000 yuan in construction funds handled by him cannot be ascertained. This proves that he had already left his post when the danger arose; otherwise, how could he not have been able to carry the account books and receipts with him? Moreover, it was widely known to the public that Li Zhongqiang and others had moved their offices to boats. Thus, there is strong suspicion that he deliberately destroyed the revenue and expenditure receipts. Furthermore, an investigation has revealed that the breaches in the transport embankment totaled twenty-seven, large and small, with a width of approximately eight hundred zhang. The smallest was about ten zhang, and the largest was about one hundred sixty to seventy zhang. The river conservancy personnel have not only failed to determine a plan to plug the largest breaches to this day, but they have not even conducted on-site measurements. If one asks how wide or deep each breach is, the river conservancy personnel stare blankly and do not know how to answer. At present, they are either slightly filling in the mouths that have already dried out or adding some soil bags to the mouths with shallower water. As for the plan and work for plugging the large mouths, they have not even begun to implement it. Recently, Shao Fuchen, the director of the Jiangdu section works, has repeatedly reported that several mouths have been plugged, but this is often inconsistent with the facts. Correspondence between government departments has been mutually deceptive, and this is not the only instance of this. According to precedent, when the Huai River floods, the Shuangjin Sluice Gate is opened to facilitate discharge. In August of this year, the gate was opened as usual, but Zhao Xiaozhai (also known as Zhao Yucheng), the stationed gatekeeper, dared to leave four bottom boards un-lifted, falsely reporting that it was fully opened, resulting in the unobstructed discharge of water. Zhao Luqi, the director of the section, was absurd not to supervise the opening of the gate in person. After the opening, he did not inspect it. After repeated questioning by the people, he discovered that there were indeed four bottom boards that had not been opened, and it was too late to remedy the situation. He then blamed the gatekeeper, as if it were none of his business. It is said that the reason why Zhao Xiaozhai did not open the Shuangjin Sluice Gate was because he was bribed by salt merchants downstream on the Salt River. According to County Magistrate He of Huaiyin County, the reason was that the customary fee of fifty yuan had not been received, so he left four boards un-lifted, and Director Zhao did not deny this. Whether it was bribery or customary fee, we will not discuss it now. As the director, Zhao Luqi did not supervise and inspect beforehand, nor did he oversee after the event, allowing him to escape. There is suspicion that he colluded to obtain bribes, and the bureau's failure to strictly pursue the matter is also perfunctory. This matter should be thoroughly investigated, and Zhao Luqi should be ordered to hand Zhao over.</p>
<p>(V) The Jiangsu Provincial Government's Measures Before and After the Dike Breach: While the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu was already taking shape and before the transportation dike breached, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had already discussed raising funds and implementing drought prevention measures, but it did not pay attention to the embankment safety engineering on the Grand Canal, especially in the dispute over opening and protecting the dams, it hesitated continuously. On July 28, it was decided that when the water level reached one zhang, seven chi, and three cun, the Cheluo Dam would be opened, and it would be opened in two stages, first opening half, and if the water continued to rise, then opening the other half. According to the Huai River system chronicles, there has never been a saying of opening half a dam. Moreover, once a dam is opened, regardless of the size of the opening, all the water will inevitably be released before long. Only opening half a dam is not allowed by the facts. Moreover, according to the water log, from the 28th, it had already reached one zhang and seven chi four cun, and it dragged on for six days, reaching one zhang and eight chi eight cun, exceeding the original water log by one chi and five cun before it was opened, resulting in obstructed discharge. The next day, it continued to rise by one cun. After Mao Yisheng telegraphed, warning of the danger and requesting permission to continue opening the Nanxin and Liang Dams, it was decided that "If the water level of the Nanxin and Liang Dams continues to rise unabated and is deemed dangerous, permission is granted to continue opening them." Carefully examine the two resolutions before and after. There is no definite position. It is seeking to shirk responsibility. At this critical moment, it is related to the lives and property of millions of people in northern Jiangsu. As the highest administrative organ of a province, how should the provincial government consider the importance of things, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and determine the position of whether to open or not, and order compliance? However, it procrastinated and delayed, and ultimately, both upstream and downstream could not be protected, saying it was negligence. What will it say? After the dike breached, the water from the upstream rivers and lakes flowed eastward together. If it is not plugged quickly, not only will the Grand Canal dry up, but also the five counties of Qin, Dong, Xing, Yan, and Fu will become lakes and swamps. The provincial government still does not quickly set up a method to plug it. It organized the so-called Jiangsu North Canal Engineering Post-Disaster Committee, which did not hold its establishment meeting until the ninth day. To date, there is still no news of construction. It has been twenty-one days since the dike breached. The provincial government is eager to accommodate the old river conservancy personnel, in order to alleviate public grievances. The consideration is not thorough. However, it only revolves around the new and old, and faces the blocking projects that millions of victims are eagerly awaiting. To this day, it has not been implemented. Is it not delaying what is urgent and taking what is light? Moreover, according to the order of the National Government to severely punish the persons in charge of water conservancy, the provincial government only dismissed Mao Yisheng and retained him. It has not been heard that other responsible persons have been punished in any way. How can it be said to be fair? How can it be said to be appropriate? In summary, in all the above mentioned sections, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's measures before and after the dike breach were all inappropriate. Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Department of Construction, Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Wu Tongju, Director of the Grand Canal Engineering Office, Li Zhongqiang, Director of the Gao Bao Section Works, Shao Fuchen, Director of the Jiangdu Section Works, Zhao Luqi, Director of the Huai Pi Section Works, and other river conservancy personnel should all be held responsible for negligent defense of the embankment. The facts and evidence are all there and can be reviewed. Since such neglect of duty has caused so many deaths and injuries, if severe punishments are not given separately, how can the official style be rectified and the people's anger be quelled, the national law be extended, and the embankment defense be emphasized? Due to the previous orders, the matter should be reported in writing and awaiting your inspection. And also request it to be forwarded to the National Government for review." (End)</p>
<p>Post-Disaster Grand Canal Committee</p>
<h3>Plans to Implement Plugging Methods</h3>
<p>After holding its second meeting, the Jiangsu Northern Jiangsu Grand Canal Engineering Relief Committee organized a secretariat to handle all documents. Although the general outline of the plugging project of the Grand Canal has been approved, the implementation methods are crucial, and it is not easy to start without on-site surveys. Therefore, Wang Shuxiang, the director of the engineering department of the committee, was sent to the various difficult-to-plug breaches of the Grand Canal (the various small breaches of Shaobo have already been plugged by the Department of Construction) to survey the water level. He will return to the town soon. It is said that the committee has decided to hold its third meeting next Wednesday (23rd) and at the same time establish engineering, work relief, and other departments. Currently, commissioned by the committee, the Department of Construction has been purchasing various plugging materials (wooden stakes, stones, earthworks) one after another and transporting them in stages. Yesterday, the third batch of engineering materials, five ships, was dispatched by the transport division of the Yizhen Society, with the Chunxin and Gaoxin two ships transporting materials to Gaoyou.</p>

<h3>Urges Opening of the San Mao You River</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Provincial Government: To the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Upon Inspection, the Grand Canal has collapsed and breached in as many as twenty-seven places, with a total length of about eight thousand feet. The land of the eight counties of the lower reaches of the river has become a swamp. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. As each breach is eroded for a long time, the situation will be level with the bottom of the canal, and there will be no hope of stopping the flow. If it is not plugged as soon as possible, this year's autumn harvest will be hopeless, and next year's planting will be impossible. Thousands of victims have no clothes or food. If they are forced by livelihood, they will take risks, and the disaster will be difficult to predict. At present, the water depth in various places in the lower reaches of the river is an average of six or seven feet. The water at each breach is still flowing east. Therefore, before plugging, emergency drainage projects should be implemented to open up the lower reaches. According to the Mao You River in the Dafeng Yuhua company area of Dongtai County, it is an important channel for entering the sea from the Guihai Dam. For emergency rescue purposes, all three Mao You rivers and the various water-blocking embankments and dams should be opened quickly to facilitate drainage. In order to take care of the interests of the majority of the people, we cannot have any concerns about the loss of small companies. The opportunity is pressing, so we specially ask you to handle it quickly and reply. The Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Order to the Party Headquarters of Each County: Upon Inspection, the Grand Canal collapsed and breached in as many as twenty-seven places. The land of each county in the lower reaches of the river has become a swamp. If the plugging has not been done, the water at the breaches will continue to flow east. The only emergency plan is to quickly plug the breaches on one side and quickly open the dams and embankments of the San Mao You River on the other side to facilitate drainage. In addition to the provincial government, our committee has telegraphed to the provincial government to quickly block the breaches along the canal and to quickly open the dams and embankments of the San Mao You River. It is appropriate to order each party headquarters to immediately supervise and report nearby.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Disaster Situation in the Second District of Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Correspondence: The second district of this county is located under the Grand Canal south of the city, facing the impact of the Che Nan Xin three dams. Whenever the dam water is discharged, the second district must be the first to suffer. On August 2nd of this year, the Cheluo Dam was opened, and the weirs in the second district were fortunately protected overnight, so there was no danger. By the night of the 4th, the Nan Xin two dams were opened at the same time, and the weirs in the second district were attacked from front and rear. The ones that bore the brunt were Hengfeng Weir, Jiajia Weir, Hufu Weir, Hexing Weir, Laoya Weir, Mao Li Weir, Wuqin Great Weir, Tongfeng Weir, Yongfeng Weir, etc., which were successively breached by the dam water. In each weir, places such as Lijia Village, Houwang Village, Chenyu Mouth, Zhangjia Village Hedong, Shanguang Village, Yuanjia Village, Jushang Village, Juxia Village, South of the Sluice River, North of the Sluice River, and Yuehe Tou, all became swamps. The fields and houses were all submerged. Later, the water gradually receded, and the water level of the Grand Canal gradually dropped. The unbroken weirs were fortunate to each other. However, on the night of August 25, a hurricane raged, and on the afternoon of the 26th at 9:00 pm, the wind was even stronger, and huge waves directly hit the embankment. Two breaches occurred one after another in the Grand Canal in the second district, twenty-five li pu (i.e., Yuehe Tou) and thirty li pu. The breach at twenty-five li pu was more than sixty zhang long, and the breach at thirty li pu was more than seventy zhang long, causing an unprecedented catastrophe in the second district. At the time of the breach, the water was extremely turbulent, the water head was about two zhang high, like a waterfall. In less than two hours, the unbroken weirs in the second district, such as Cheluo Nan Weir, Cheluo Bei Weir, Hucao Weir, Fenggu Weir, Zhangshiniang Weir, and Huzhuang Weir, were flooded one after another. In each weir, such as Xiajia Tomb, Shihe Manor, Guanhe Manor, Yaojia Nunnery, Daqiao, Dizang Nunnery, Longjia Ditch, Gongtian Temple, Zhangjia Village, and Hujia Village, the water instantly flooded the roofs, about one zhang deep. At that time, the cries of the people in each village shook the sky. They all supported the old and carried the young to escape to the weir bank or high piers. Those who did not have time to escape and were swept away by the waves are also unknown. Although the water has gradually receded, 80-90% of the houses in the second district have been washed away. The disaster is the most severe in Hengfeng Weir, Jiajia Weir, Hufu Weir, Hexing Weir, Laoya Weir, Mao Li Weir, Wuqin Great Weir, Tongfeng Weir, and Yongfeng Weir. The above weirs suffered from the harm of the breach first and then the disaster of the dike break. According to the survey of the district office, there are about 40,000 refugees, and three-quarters of them have no home to return to. Now they are all sleeping on the weir banks and the Grand Canal, starving and waiting to be fed. The situation is extremely miserable. (September 17)</p>

<h3>Request to Allocate American Wheat to Exchange for Wheat Seeds</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department previously, because of the continuous rain disaster in Jiangsu Province and the breaches in the Grand Canal, many people died, and the living were displaced. Distributing urgent relief was a temporary measure. In a blink of an eye, the water upstream receded, and we should quickly plan winter cultivation to seek remedy. However, now the farmers have run out of food, let alone seeds. Therefore, we telegraphed to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that 20,000 dan of American wheat be allocated under the American wheat loan, and that personnel be sent to Jiangsu, or the department be entrusted to find ways to exchange suitable wheat seeds from counties with lighter disasters and lend them to farmers in counties with severe disasters for planting. It is said that the department received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, agreeing to ask the Disaster Relief Committee to handle it according to the situation. At the same time, the department also received a reply from the Disaster Relief Committee, agreeing to find a way. The Ministry of Industry's instructions stated that "The Hui telegram knows that the director of the department's request to allocate 20,000 dan of American wheat in advance to exchange for suitable wheat seeds to remedy winter cultivation is very insightful. I have asked the Disaster Relief Committee to handle it according to the situation." Wait for the reply before proceeding. The Disaster Relief Committee replied that "Director He Yushu of the Agricultural and Mining Department knows that the document respects the planning of winter cultivation. The American wheat has not yet arrived. When it arrives, we will find a way." Zhu Qinglan bows.</p>
<h3>General Situation of the Disaster in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department divides the disaster area into five grades</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Branch actively handles urgent relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The river water has been receding quite quickly in recent days. According to the Hankou Jianghan Customs report on the 18th, the upper thousand water mark was 49 feet and 6 inches, and in the afternoon it was 49 feet and 2 inches. In half a day, the water had receded 4 inches. Areas along the river in Hankou City, such as Special District 2, Jianghan Customs, Minsheng Road, Simin Street, and Houhualou, have already dried up, and rickshaws can travel smoothly. The roadbed between Dazhimen Station and Jiang'an was also excavated on the 18th to drain the accumulated water, which can be quickly discharged into the river within a few days. However, the water in the low-lying sections of the inner streets is still more than ten feet deep, and the underground drains are also blocked by silt, so it is necessary to pump and dredge. In Wuchang, there is no water in the city, and the breach is still a huge flood. Repairs to the breaches and drainage are underway. There are no reports on whether the water has receded in the outer counties. The disaster has lasted for nearly two months. As of recently, according to statistics from the Civil Affairs Department, it is divided into five grades: the most severe, the second most severe, the lighter, the second lightest, and the lightest. In Hankou City alone, 550,087 people were affected by the disaster, and more than 200,000 people are in urgent need of relief. The number of people accommodated in the various shelters totaled 58,071. In Wuchang City alone, 144,988 people were affected by the disaster, and the number of people accommodated in the various shelters totaled 72,712. In Hanyang City alone, 87,112 people were affected by the disaster, and the number of people accommodated in the various shelters totaled 17,584. In Hankou City alone, a total of 387 floating corpses and 1,231 floating coffins were collected. Those drifting with the water and buried by private individuals or groups are not included. In the entire province of Hubei, 68 counties were affected, and 45 counties were affected. The total population of the province is 30 million, and 9.5 million people were affected by the disaster, accounting for more than 35% of the total population. The total area of the province is approximately 750,873 square li, and approximately 169,000 square li were flooded, accounting for more than 22% of the total area. More than 5 million people are in urgent need of relief. The depth of suffering of the people of Hubei can be seen from this. The Disaster Relief Branch, the Urgent Relief Society, and the Hubei Provincial Government are now trying to provide relief in different ways. The Disaster Relief Branch is committed to handling urgent relief. In addition to allocating US$100,000 in aid from the American Red Cross to the entire city of Hankou, it has allocated all of the 400,000 yuan controlled by the General Association to the urgent relief of various counties and compiled five investigation teams to go to the counties most severely affected by the disaster to conduct detailed surveys. The first team is responsible for Wuchang, Hanyang, Echeng, Huanggang, Daye, etc. The second team is responsible for Qishui, Qichun Yangxin, Guangji, Huangmei, etc. The third team is responsible for Jiayu Puqi, Xianning, Jianli, Shishou, etc. The fourth team is responsible for Gong'an, Hanchuan, Mianyang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, etc. The fifth team is responsible for Yingcheng, Yunmeng, Huangpi, Xiaogan, etc. After the investigation, they will begin to allocate relief funds. The Urgent Relief Society is paying attention to the issue of immigration. At first, the association asked the Zhejiang Provincial Government about the measures to be taken in Zhejiang Province, which has always been known as prosperous. On the 17th, it received a reply stating the difficulties, roughly saying that Zhejiang Province had been ravaged by continuous rainstorms and typhoons this year. More than 40 counties had been affected by the disaster, and the disaster was extremely severe. There were also many victims. It is currently requesting a large amount of funds from the central government to provide relief. For foreign victims, if they are accommodated in the provincial capital, it will be difficult to provide for them. If they are distributed to various counties, most of them are disaster areas, and they will not be able to get food. Victims who come from afar will still not be able to live their lives safely. This is not a proper way. After repeated consideration, we had to ask your office to persuade them not to come to Zhejiang, so as to avoid being in a dilemma. After receiving the telegram, the association had to cancel the previous proposal. At this time, Liu Zijun, a representative of the Harbin Hubei Association, telegraphed, requesting immigration to reclaim land there. The association then issued a notice to the county magistrates of each county to submit name lists for repatriation. As for the provincial government, in addition to asking the central government to dredge the Yangtze River, it is also paying attention to the revitalization of Wuhan. Chairman He Chengjun proposed a work relief and construction plan and fundraising methods and submitted it to the 28th meeting of the Provincial Government on the 17th for discussion. It was resolved and passed and ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to quickly draft a plan to excavate a branch river from Caidian to Chenjiaji and ordered the Hankou Municipal Government to quickly draft a plan for the Hankou Ring Road and submit it for approval in order to transfer it to the central government for allocation of funds for construction. The original order is as follows: (1) Order to the Water Conservancy Bureau, Upon inspection, this flood was huge and was a rare occurrence in a century. It lasted for two months. The financial district of Hankou, a giant port for Chinese and foreigners, was destroyed, and the ground was full of people crying. The miserable situation is sympathetic to both China and foreign countries. If we do not quickly seek remedy and implement work relief measures, the market will not be able to recover, the victims will not be able to gather, and the flood in Hankou will not be able to be eliminated in the future. The government plans to excavate a branch river from Caidian along Zhanggong Causeway to Chenjiaji to discharge the Han River in order to reduce the original water level entering the river from Caidian to Hankou. We ask the central government to allocate funds for work relief, which is extremely important for relief to the victims and for the post-disaster affairs of Hankou. The Chairman's proposal was discussed at the 28th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. After the Water Conservancy Bureau drafts a plan to excavate a branch river, it will be submitted to the government for transfer to the central government for fundraising and construction. Therefore, the bureau is ordered to comply with this order and submit a plan to excavate a branch river from Caidian to Chenji within the specified number of days for review and handling. Do not delay. (2) Order to the Hankou Municipal Government, The government plans to raise the Hankou Ring Road by four or five feet higher than the existing road. We ask the central government to allocate funds for work relief, which is extremely important for relief to the victims and for the post-disaster affairs of Hankou. The Chairman's proposal was discussed at the 28th meeting. After the municipal government drafts a plan to raise the road, it will be submitted to the government for transfer to the central government for fundraising and construction. Therefore, the municipal government is ordered to draft a plan to raise the Hankou Ring Road and submit it for review and handling. Do not delay. (July 18)</p>

<h3>Surviving Aviator Passes Through Harbin</h3>
<p>Alber's left leg is broken</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Eurasia Aviation Post Plane No. 2, which flew from Ping to Manchuria on July 1 carrying a large number of mail, was unfortunately shot down by Russian and Mongolian troops on the morning of July 2 at the junction of Inner and Outer Mongolia with machine guns. After a month, there has been no news. On the morning of the 14th, the pilot of the plane, Raedetz, and the telegraph operator, Alber, came to Harbin from Manchuria and took a car to Beiping that evening. Foreign newspaper reporters here met Raedetz at the Madiel Hotel and saw that Alber's left leg was broken and he was walking with a cane. Mr. Lai narrated the experience of his return and the danger he encountered. According to him, on July 2, when he was flying near Manchuria, due to the weather, he was flying very low. At this time, he suddenly encountered Mongolian troops who shot with machine guns, and Mr. Alber's left leg was hit. At that time, I planned to fly over, but the fuselage was badly damaged, and Mr. A was bleeding profusely from his leg and shouting non-stop. I had no choice but to land and was immediately surrounded by Mongolian troops, who dragged the two of us out of the plane and searched us severely, and searched the fuselage for a long time. They then sent us to Baduming and imprisoned me, and sent Alber to the hospital. Because the treatment was too late, he had his foot cut off. Not long after, I was sent to Kulun Prison and interrogated three times. They asked what I was carrying when I flew back and forth for more than a month before I was shot down. I replied that they were all packages and mail and was sentenced to ten years in prison for espionage. Fortunately, the German government intervened and released us. On September 3, I took a large car from Kulun to Ulan-Ude. On the way, I saw that the plane had been dismantled, and the parts had been transported to Kulun. On September 10, I took the Siberian car to Manchuria, and the postal staff bought the tickets for me before I arrived in mainland China. In addition, Ms. Rode, a German Berlin reporter, came to Harbin to wait for three days for this matter and went to Ping with her the night before last (15th).</p>

<p>Local Gentry in Beijing Request the Removal and Punishment of the Director of the Embankment Works: It is said that the Jinshan Mouth Embankment Works was in danger, and the Director of the Embankment Works, Xue Xing'an, was derelict in his duties. Recently, two local gentlemen in Beijing, Zhu Xufan and Niu Qi, telegraphed the province, requesting that the truth about Director Xue's dereliction of duty be investigated and that he be removed and punished to emphasize the importance of people's lives. I don't know if the superiors will follow suit.</p>

<p>Police and Bandits in Zhi Du Port Have a Fierce Battle to Rescue Hostages: In recent days, bandits in the Taihu Lake area have become rampant again, and the villagers in various places are very panicked. Shen, the district chief of the Third District of the Water Police, immediately assembled police teams and set off in separate directions to conduct a large-scale search and arrest. At about 10:00 pm on the 19th, Xu Boying, the captain of the 14th team, led his team through Zhi Du Port and saw a bandit ship. He immediately chased after it. At that time, the bandits had already learned of the situation. When the police team caught up, they immediately opened fire to resist. Captain Xu then ordered the team members to return fire. After an hour of mutual shooting, the bandits could not hold on and jumped into the water and fled. A bandit ship was captured, and four female hostages who had been kidnapped from Shuangyang Town, Wujiang County, were on board. They were immediately taken back to the team headquarters. All the police teams on each road met at the Temple Fair yesterday (20th) and set off again to suppress the bandits. District Chief Shen also received a report that bandits had been found in Meiyan and sent two vanguard ships and investigators to block them yesterday (20th).</p>
<p>Attached to Wujiang: Three Farmers Kidnapped: At about 9:00 pm on the 19th, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the Liuxuan Village area, about six or seven li outside the North Gate of Wujiang County, and kidnapped three farmers, including Zhou Laosi. The parties reported to the Water and Land Public Security Organs and asked them to send a team to rescue them.</p>

<p>Fang Epo's Soil Trafficking Case: Guarantor's Bad Luck. Fang Zhaodi (also known as Epo), the director of the local opium suppression and investigation office, was reported by party member Lu Shaozeng to the party and government organs for opium smoking and soil trafficking after the office was ordered to be abolished. The county repeatedly ordered his arrest without success. Last month, Fang Zhaodi voluntarily surrendered to the county and reported for duty. After interrogation by Shen Chengyuan, he was ordered to be sent to a pre-knowledge hospital for examination. There was no toxic reaction. However, regarding the soil trafficking part, the plaintiff still needed to be summoned for questioning and verification. He was released on a three thousand yuan bond guarantee. Subsequently, Feng Baoqin, the manager of Yu Da Nanhuo Store, went to the county to provide a guarantee. However, Fang did not appear at the rehearing on the 31st of last month, so his guarantor was arrested. It was said that Fang had gone to Gao Shao to raise funds and requested a postponement. The county rejected the request and ordered the guarantor to pay the three thousand yuan into the case. Feng Baoqin, the guarantor, was taken into custody. At that time, Feng requested to find Fang Zhaodi and hand him over within four days. The trial officer then ordered a continuous bond to be released. Unexpectedly, half a month passed, and Feng had no news. The county government issued a notice yesterday (the 19th), ruling that "the three thousand yuan guarantee paid by Feng Baoqin for Fang Zhaodi on August 28th, 20th year of the Republic of China, should be confiscated."</p>
<p>A Young Man Sacrifices Himself for Marriage. Hengsheng Chang Pisi Tobacco Shop, located outside the south gate of this county, has been open for decades. There is an apprentice in the store named Ni Lansheng, who is 22 years old. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Ni suddenly sneaked into the bedroom and did not come out for a long time. When he was called for dinner, he was found lying on the bed with a pale face. When he was called, he did not respond. When he was pushed, he did not wake up. Only then did they realize something had happened and urgently informed the shop owner, Peng Huixuan, who immediately called two Western doctors. However, it was too late to save him. The cause of Ni's death was unknown, and there was no suicide note to be found. According to the speculation of his colleagues, Ni had been a matchmaker this summer and planned to betroth a certain woman. The other party required Ni to pay a bride price of one hundred yuan. However, Ni was fond of leisure and lacked savings. Perhaps this was the reason for his drastic action. As for what kind of poison he took, it is unknown. The store is currently contacting his family (in Renyang Township) to come to the city to retrieve his body.</p>

(6) The representatives of all people's organizations present jointly send a telegram to the central government, preparing to declare war on Japan, remove and investigate Wang Zhengting, announce an economic boycott against Japan, and instruct the suppression of reactionary policies. Resolved: Passed. Finally, the representatives successively expressed many anti-Japanese opinions, all of which were decided to be submitted to the committee for consideration and handling. In addition, the county chamber of commerce, due to the sudden change in Shenyang, with everyone filled with shared hatred and anger, previously announced that all industries should implement an economic boycott in accordance with Shanghai's methods, with the trade association responsible for handling it. If anyone secretly imports Japanese goods, the goods should be sealed and severely punished after public discussion. As the situation is now urgent, starting from today, all silk, cloth, foreign goods, hardware, electrical materials, southern goods, mountain goods, books, paper, and Western medicine industries must register their Japanese goods, and they must all be sealed by the trade association and must not be sold in stores again. It is also limited to one week, that is, before the 26th of this month, the trade association must make a list of the sealed Japanese goods and report it to the association for reference. If there is any private sale of Japanese goods, each industry should conduct strict inspections by itself, and listen to the severe sanctions of the public. The chamber of commerce will not tolerate it in any way to avoid being held responsible for others, and to show its determination to resist. Yesterday, a notice was specially published in the newspaper to inform all merchants and people in the county so that everyone would be aware. At the same time, the association also telegraphed the chambers of commerce of all counties in Jiangsu Province to unite and act as a strong backing.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Distributing Land to Accommodate Disaster Victims from the Xiangxia River. Nantong is accommodating disaster victims from various counties in the Lixia River. The ten established shelters are already full. Those who continue to arrive are impossible to accommodate. The county government telegraphed the provincial government, requesting to distribute land to accommodate disaster victims. On the 19th, a reply telegram was received, stating that additional shelters have been set up and that Huaian, Huaiyin, Taixing and other three counties have been telegraphed to prepare immediately.</p>
<p>Court Hearing on the Cash-Silver Conversion Case. The civil court of the court heard the dispute between the Education Bureau and the money merchants on the conversion of the public funds deposited in cash into silver. The Education Bureau requested settlement according to the silver price at the time of deposit, and the money merchants requested reference to the current market price and the conversion at the time of deposit. The court ordered that the case be pronounced on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Police Chief Extorting Under the Guise of Disaster Relief. Ma Ji, the police chief of Liuqiao, was ordered to seal hired ships to go to Xingdong and other counties to rescue disaster victims. He used this opportunity to extort money from ship owners. The party department reported this and requested the county government to remove him from his post. However, Ma Ji is the nephew-in-law of Mao Mujun, the director of the county bureau, and he deliberately protects him, causing public outcry. The victimized ship owners are now suing the court for Ma's illegal extortion.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Execution by Firing Squad of Gang Robber and Child Kidnapping Criminals. Wu Xiyun (26 years old) and Jia Changfu (36 years old), two bandits from Funing, who were previously apprehended by the Public Security Bureau's detective team from Zhen, were escorted to Yangzhou. After interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Governor's Office, they confessed to robbing the home of Zhu Zheng'an, a resident of Yangzhong County, and kidnapping his three-year-old child for ransom. On the morning of the 19th, in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, the identities of Wu and Jia were verified, and they were tied and taken to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad. New Plan for Sheltering Refugees. The refugee shelter here has long been overcrowded. Now, because Chiang Wei-chi-fu, a member of the Dongtai Chamber of Commerce, has transported another 400 refugees here, the Seventh Refugee Shelter has been expanded to accommodate them. The address is Beilai Temple, which has been ordered by the county chamber of commerce and the anti-smuggling bureau to have the anti-smuggling company originally stationed in the temple relocated. Another 600 refugees have been transported to Zhenjiang. Governor Zhang Zhijiang, believing that Yangzhou's capacity cannot be further expanded, has telegraphed Song Ziwen, Xu Junren, Ye Chucang, and the Shanghai Renji Hall to state the difficulties, saying that it is appropriate to make overall plans and properly seek relief. It seems that refugee shelters can be established in the county towns that have been affected by the disaster, and the local officials and gentry should be responsible for setting up refugee shelters to accommodate the refugees as much as possible, so as to avoid displacement and crowding in one area, and it is necessary to determine a complete and proper follow-up plan.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>More Refugees From Dongtai Arrive. The Rugao Committee for Accommodating and Transporting Disaster Victims transported 40 Dongtai refugees back from Dongtai yesterday. The County Shipping Association also transported 21 refugees back from Dongtai on the same day, and they were sent to various shelters for accommodation.</p>
<p>Pirates Rampant, Telegram Calls for Dispatching Troops to Suppress. The rampant pirates of Juegang have been reported previously. It is now known that on the night of the 9th, more than 100 pirates suddenly landed at the Nankan estuary, went to the Nanbingfang area of Dayu Town, and kidnapped more than ten tenant farmers of Dayu Company. By the time the garrison's security team heard the news and rushed there, the pirates had already fled far away. The Juegang District Office has sent a telegram to the county government, which in turn telegraphed the Jiangsu Pacification Governor's Office, requesting to dispatch troops to suppress them.</p>

<p>Situation of the Three Counties Jointly Suppressing the Shubo Bandits. The police teams of Huaian, Siyang, and Muyang counties received a telegram on the 11th from Wen Qinming, the joint defense director of the five counties of Suqian, Siyang, Muyang, Sishui, and Huaiyin, ordering them to gather at Zhou Xiaoyuan, Dongxizhuang, the border between Shuyang and Sishui counties, to jointly suppress the Duan Yuchun bandit group entrenched there. The attack began at 7:00 PM that day (the 17th), and a siege formation was quickly adopted. The firepower was strongest around 12:00 AM, and the bandits, knowing they could not win, shouted wildly and broke through the Shuyang police blockade and fled, leaving behind eight bandit corpses, including the corpse of bandit leader Duan Yuchun. The next day, at dawn, the police teams of the three counties tracked them to the Yangzhuang area of the Fourth District of Siyang, and resumed the siege formation. The bandits resisted stubbornly throughout the day. Until 9:00 PM, Deng Jiandi, the captain of the Second Squadron of the Huaian Police Team, and Li Xiuming, the chief of the Third Sub-Squadron of the First Squadron, led their troops to charge, and the bandits broke through the Shuyang police and fled in all directions. About a dozen bandits were killed in this battle. On the 13th, the police searched separately, and on the 14th, they returned to their original defenses. A total of 20 bandits were killed, and there were no casualties among the officers and soldiers. District Chief Apprehends a Harboring Bandit. Chen Yihui, the district chief of the Second District of Huaian, because the younger sister of Zhou Shouqian, a farmer in the district, was abducted by bandit Wang Laomao and others at the beginning of the month, conducted extensive investigations and apprehended Pu Zhang, who had been harboring the bandit along with the victim, and escorted them to the county on the afternoon of the 14th. On the 15th, after Su Cheng, the trial officer, summoned Zhou Shou, the plaintiff, to court for interrogation, Cao Zhang confessed to harboring the victim, but refused to reveal who the kidnappers were. Finally, Xiao Pan ordered Zhou's daughter to be taken back by her brother, and Cao Zhang was ordered to be detained for further interrogation in order to apprehend the kidnappers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Executes Bandits. The police team of Tongshan County, on April 14th of this year, discovered a bandit named Zhang Baode in the case of the abduction of Zhang Guanghuan's son at the East Railway Station, and escorted him to the county government for interrogation. The trial officers Huang Jiazhen and Li Weiyuan interrogated him repeatedly without making a judgment. Later, Zhang Guanghuan filed a complaint with the 41st Division of the Army, which transferred it to the Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters, which transferred the county file, and brought the bandit Zhang Baode for questioning and clarification, and sentenced him to death. Today (the 17th) at 3:00 PM, the headquarters sent a team to the county government to identify the bandit Zhang Baode, tie him up, and take him to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Strict Opium Prohibition Measures in Zhejiang Province. In recent years, opium addiction has spread throughout Zhejiang Province. Initially, only Jin, Qu, and Yan areas were rampant with red pills and morphine. Then, Ning, Shao, Tai, and Hangzhou prefectures also spread quite severely. In the past, opium prohibition laws only imposed a small amount of fines or the lowest sentences, while traffickers and manufacturers made huge profits and could become rich overnight. It is difficult to completely eliminate opium addiction. At this county magistrate selection meeting, Zhang Songnian, the county magistrate of Yiwu, and others proposed to formulate a separate law, proposing to punish manufacturers, traffickers, and users with the death penalty or confiscate all property. Public officials who harbor or engage in the same behavior will be sentenced to death. After discussion, it was suggested to the central government to increase the penalties in the opium prohibition law by one-half for those who manufacture, traffic, or harbor red pills, opium, morphine, and other drugs. The provincial government transferred a letter to the Zhejiang Higher Court, paying special attention to opium prohibition cases in various counties and severely punishing them.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Bandit's Appeal Case, Order to Summon Neighbor Witnesses. Shen Hairong, the son of Shen Ruikang, a resident of the Sixth District Tongren United Village, was kidnapped by bandits at night in early September of last year and hidden on the upper floor of the Huasheng Straw Hat Company in Songxia. Later, Hairong escaped during an opportunity and reported to the Songxia Public Security Bureau, which, together with the nearby county defense team, led them to surround and arrest them, arresting the ringleader Shen Ziqing and two boatmen, as well as two women, and escorting them to the county for interrogation. Subsequently, after the sentence, Shen Ziqing was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, and the three suspected boatmen, husband, wife, and daughter, were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The criminals were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. The High Court held several hearings, and for the sake of caution, recently ordered Feng Bingyao, a villager in the same village who was a named witness for Shen Ziqing, to appear in court. The final judgment was made.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Passenger on the Ningxing Steamer Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea. At 5:00 PM on the 17th of this month, the Ningxing steamer, which travels between Ningbo and Shanghai, was sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo. When the ship was out of Wusong and passing through the Daji Ocean, a passenger who was about 40 years old and spoke with a Ningbo accent, wearing a dark gray silk long gown and white striped shirt and trousers, took advantage of the unguarded moment and left his berth on the outer third-class cabin. Wu Abiao, the tea room attendant, noticed that he had not returned for a long time and that his actions were suspicious. He immediately checked the berth and found only a long gown, a tin cigarette case under the pillow containing a one-yuan pawn ticket from Shanghai Fuda Pawnshop, and a suicide note. The note stated that the pain in his heart was unknown to anyone, and that he did not want to live in this world, so he was committing suicide by jumping into the sea. It was signed with an anonymous name. Judging from his clothes and other items, it seemed that he had been unemployed for a long time and was having difficulty making a living, leading him to take this desperate measure.</p>

<p>Men's Singles Tennis</p>
<h3>Yu Tianguang Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Straight Sets Victory Over Qian Yaobin in the Finals</p>
<p>丨Excellent Performances by Both Sides丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yu Tianguang defeated Qian Yaobin in straight sets with scores of 6-2, 7-5, and 6-1 to win the men's singles tennis championship. Both sides performed better than usual, which can be said to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Review of the Battle</p>
<p>丨Yaobin Could Have Won the Second Set丨</p>
<p>The first set was 6-2, and the third set was 6-1. Although the fighting between the two sides was fierce, the situation leaned to one side. The second set was quite fierce, with a score of 7-5. In the first set, Yu directly took five sets, and Qian only got the sixth and seventh innings. In the second set, Qian Yaobin had an excellent advantage with a score of 3-1, but he immediately lost three consecutive innings. Although he tried to tie the score at 4-4 and 5-5, he ultimately lost the last two innings and lost again with a score of 5-7. Qian could have won this set, but he lost it. As a result, the third set was beyond recovery, and he only won one inning in the second set. With a score of 1-6, he lost three straight and Yu won the championship.</p>
<p>Striking Styles of Both Sides</p>
<p>丨Yu and Qian Were Both Excellent, Yu Was Slightly Better丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, both players performed better than usual, using all their energy to fight. Both sides mostly used strong, long shots from the baseline, rarely coming to the net. In terms of long shots, Yu was more stable than Qian, and Yu's diagonal east-west shots forced Qian to run around and unable to cope. This was also the reason for the victory. Qian had the opportunity to come to the net at the beginning of the second set, and won three innings as a result. However, his interception errors and lack of control often caused the ball to touch the net, resulting in many lost points. Qian's serve had a total of six or seven double faults. The first set was given away because of this. As for Yu's forehand and backhand shots, they can be said to have been extremely successful and flawless yesterday. Qian was still lacking in depth and courage, so he often hit the baseline three or four feet high, unable to deliver the fatal blow. As for the force of the blows, both sides had exhausted their strength.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Municipal Government Employees' Health Sports Event</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the Shanghai Municipal Government Employees' Health Sports Competition, and it was also the day for the finals of various sports. The track and field tug-of-war in the morning was held at the China Track and Field Stadium. The mayor and directors of various bureaus all participated in the event, and no fewer than 2,000 people watched. The basketball and soccer finals in the afternoon were held at the Municipal No. 1 Stadium, and the enthusiastic audience numbered over 1,000. The results of each final are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Track and Field</p>
<p>(1) 100 meters: Xue Jianqiu (Land), Chen Shijian (Land), Shen Zhixing (Social), Hu Jiazhen (Land), 12 seconds</p>
<p>(2) 200 meters: Xue Jianqiu (Land), Chen Shijian (Land), Hu Jiazhen (Land), Shen Zhixing (Land), 25.2 seconds</p>
<p>(3) 400 meters: Xue Jianqiu (Land), Chen Shijian (Land), He Guoying (Finance), Hua Runtang (Land), 58.75 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Long Jump: Zou Zhixian (Social), Li Jianhou (Land), Zheng Shouqing (Land), Su Hongyuan (Labor), 4.98 meters</p>
<p>(5) Women's 50 meters: Zhu Ruiying (Public Security), Hu Yueying (Health), Wang Youfang (Social), 8.8 seconds</p>
<p>(6) Officials 100 meters: Shen Junyi (Labor), Hu Hongji (Health), Chen Xizeng (Public Security), Yu Hongjun (Government), 15 seconds</p>
<p>Based on the total scores, Xue Jianqiu was first individually, and the Land Bureau was first by organization. Xue's scores in the three events were all good, and the rest could only sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>In the women's 50-meter race, eight people participated, and four competed on the field. Zhu Ruiying, Hu Yueying, and Wang Youfang arrived at the finish line with very small differences, which shows the fierceness of the competition. It can be seen that in the men's track and field competition, the Public Security Bureau did not score any points (except in the officials' group), so Ms. Zhu can be said to have been loyal to the group and slightly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Those who joined the official 100-meter race included Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and bureau chiefs Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xizeng, Hu Hongji, Shen Junyi, Zhu Yan, and Xu Peihuang. When they stood on the starting line, Zhang, the mayor, explained the rules and instructed the methods in an organized manner. When the order was given to start, Secretary-General Yu flew forward, but unfortunately did not wear running shoes and slipped to the ground at 20 meters. He jumped up and continued running, and still won fourth place, which can be called a strong performance.</p>
<p>(2) Tug-of-War Finals</p>
<p>Land Bureau Wins Over Education Bureau</p>
<p>The participants in the tug-of-war competition were the Health, Education, Land, and Public Security Bureaus. The Education Bureau defeated the Health Bureau in the preliminary rounds, and the Land Bureau defeated the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the Education and Land Bureaus had the right to compete in the finals. In the competition method, each team sent six players, and a distance of eight feet was marked on the ground. The players held both ends of a giant rope. Upon hearing the order, they each pulled with all their strength. Whoever could make the opponent cross the dividing line was the winner.</p>
<p>(3) Basketball Finals</p>
<p>Social Bureau Wins Over Municipal Government 39-19</p>
<p>With the ringing of the bell twice, the warriors of both sides entered the field, each with the determination to win. Zong Xiaojie and Peng Shanzeng of the Municipal Government were especially brave, but the overall connection of the army seemed to be inferior to that of the Social Bureau, so the Municipal Government was often behind in the accumulation of points. In the first half, the Municipal Government suffered a small setback with a score of 17-11. In the second half, the Social Bureau's hard fighting was even more intense. Zheng Zhixian, Niu Yinchu, and Pan Shouheng, three tiger generals, galloped left and right and were irresistible. The score was also far above the Municipal Government, 22-8. The total score was 39-19, and the Social Bureau won the championship. Referee Zhang Longhai, Inspector Ni Tuming.</p>
<p>Social Bureau</p>
<p>Position and Name, Shots Made, Free Throws, Fouls, Points</p>
<p>Right Forward Zou Zhixian, 4 Balls, 1 Free Throw, 1 Foul, 9 Points</p>

<p>Total, 8 Balls, 3 Free Throws, 8 Fouls, 19 Points</p>
<p>(4) Soccer Finals</p>
<p>Social Bureau Wins Over Land Bureau 1-0</p>
<p>The two soccer teams each had their strengths. The Social Bureau's forwards were sharp and the Land Bureau's defenders were strong. The forces were evenly matched and the battle was often tense. Even the unexpected and dangerous balls were constantly emerging. Both goalkeepers were extremely calm and turned danger into safety, which was no small feat. In the Social team, Yu Zhongmei's attack was brave and Niu Yinchu's passing was fast. In the Land team, Li Jianhou's interception was quick and Cai Ruiqing's response was appropriate. Both were top-notch talents. The two sides mixed together in a desperate battle. With only two or three minutes left, the Social team had a chance for a penalty kick. Yu Zhongmei kicked it out, but it was rejected by the Land goalkeeper. The Social five forwards did not give up, surrounded and attacked fiercely, with short-range attacks, one after another, and finally won a goal. They moved the ball to the center for another battle. Although the Land team had the intention to retaliate, they had no time to do so. With the sound of the long whistle, the battle mist disappeared. The soccer championship once again belonged to the Social Bureau. Referee Tang Xianguang.</p>

<h3>Lin Qiu Jiang Should Attend the National Games (Confirmed)</h3>
<p>丨To Win Glory for the City丨To Seek Progress for the Tennis World</p>
<p>Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, and Jiang Daozhang are first-class tennis players in the tennis world. This city possesses the three players Lin, Qiu, and Jiang. It seems there is considerable confidence in winning the tennis championship at the upcoming National Games. However, according to those close to Lin and Jiang, Lin has already accepted the invitation to serve as a tennis referee at the National Games and will not represent the city in competition. Jiang, due to special circumstances, may also not be able to go to the capital. Such news is truly like adding ice to a charcoal fire. However, we believe that Lin and Jiang should represent the city and should not have this objection. We dare to state the reasons as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lin, Qiu, and Jiang enjoy the highest reputation in the Chinese tennis world. Their skills are beyond introduction. During the 8th Far Eastern Games, they seized the tennis championship from Japanese and Philippine players. Lin and Jiang even traveled across the ocean to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup. Such grand events have deeply impressed players from various provinces and cities and people across the country. This National Games is a great opportunity. Everyone wants to take this opportunity to witness the brilliance of Lin, Qiu, and Jiang. If Lin and Jiang do not go, they will truly disappoint the hopes of the people across the country.</p>
<p>(2) If Lin and Jiang were far away in a foreign land and unable to participate in the competition, there would be nothing to be done. Now, Shanghai and Nanjing are not far apart, only a seven-hour journey. If they refuse to go, people will make various comments, such as "arrogant" or "afraid," which will be detrimental to Lin and Jiang. Moreover, since they can go to serve as referees, why not go to compete? It only makes people guess more.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese tennis is truly immature. This National Games gathers the talents of various provinces and cities. Lin, Qiu, and Jiang should participate in the competition and perform their skills, allowing players from various provinces and cities to learn and return. This is the fundamental purpose of promoting the National Games and the responsibility that advanced players should have.</p>
<p>(4) Everyone belongs to a group and should be loyal to the group. They should also jointly maintain the group life. Now, Shanghai intends to select the best players to represent the city and participate in the National Games. Those who are selected should, in the absence of special circumstances, have a team spirit and go together, and should not shirk.</p>
<p>(5) Singaporean tennis players Lin Wangsu and Lin Yuehan are strong and formidable opponents for our city to win the championship. If Lin and Jiang do not go, causing us to lose the championship, Lin and Jiang will bear the responsibility. Although the gain or loss of the championship is not very important, it is not in the spirit of sports to have talent and not use it, or to retreat without fighting.</p>
<p>Grass Court Tennis Association</p>
<h3>Lin Qiu Retains Open Doubles Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, After a Fierce Five-Set Battle, They Defeated Karna Fanluo and Huite</p>
<p>In the Senior Singles First Week, Defu Defeated Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, after losing in a 1-2 disadvantage yesterday, still defeated Karna Fanluo and Huite by 3-2, continuing to retain the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Association's Open Doubles Championship. Spectators praised them greatly. At the same time, Defu and Jiang Daozhang competed in the first week of the senior singles competition. Defu won in straight sets.</p>
<h3>Defu Defeats Jiang Daozhang</h3>
<p>丨Senior Singles First Week丨</p>
<p>Six to Four</p>
<p>Defu Six to Four Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>Although Jiang Daozhang Lost, He Was Not Far Behind. Although Jiang lost yesterday, the scores were exceptionally close. In the first set, he once led 3-2 and 4-3, but eventually lost the first set after losing three consecutive games. In the second set, he lost three consecutive games, then recovered three games, reaching 4-4 again. He lost again 4-6. In the third set, he also scored one game, not being completely defeated. Jiang's diagonal long shots yesterday were accurate and powerful. His volleys and lobs also showed great improvement, eliminating the chaos of the past and earning much applause. However, it seemed his energy was exhausted in the third set. However, losing to Defu with this performance is truly not easy.</p>
<p>The Fierce Battle at the End of Next Week: It is said that the senior singles semi-finals are scheduled to be held next Saturday, and the senior and junior singles finals will be held simultaneously on Sunday. The semi-finals of the senior singles will be Lin Baohua vs. Defu, and Qiu Feihai vs. Biaoji Xiong. The meeting of these four heroes will be a feast for tennis fans.</p>
<p>Lin Qiu Retains Championship</p>
<p>丨Not Panicking in Chaos Leads to Victory丨</p>
<p>Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai Six to Three, Three to Six, Two to Six, Six to Two, Six to Two Karna Fanluo, Huite</p>
<p>Lin Qiu's Impressive Five Consecutive Games: They were quite impressive on the court.</p>
<p>Lin and Qiu’s perfect cooperation was extraordinary, and Karna and Huite were not their opponents at all. Lin won a game with his serve, then won five consecutive games in one go. Everyone thought they would win in straight sets. Who knew that Lin and Qiu, fearing the other side's embarrassment, suddenly conceded a game. Then, Huite suddenly shone, again and again, catching up three games. Seeing the situation was not good, Lin and Qiu then solemnly won the first set 6-3.</p>
<p>The Disturbance After Qiu Feihai's Decline: In the second set, the situation suddenly changed drastically. Qiu Feihai was extremely dejected. None of his diagonal shots were successful, and many went out of bounds. His interceptions also frequently touched the net. Thus, after Karna and Huite tied the score at 3-3, they scored seven consecutive games. In other words, Lin and Qiu lost seven consecutive games, meaning Karna and Huite won the second set 6-3. They led 4-0 in the third set.</p>
<p>Karna Fanluo's Powerful Kills: In the fifth game of the third set, Lin and Qiu only won after many deuces, making the score 4-1. Karna and Huite took advantage of the situation and launched a large-scale attack, holding the net and killing fiercely. Lin and Qiu were at a loss and could not recover, losing the third set 2-6.</p>
<p>Not Panicking in Chaos, Adversity Turns to Prosperity: At this point, Lin and Qiu were in a precarious situation. Qiu and Lin practiced briefly and returned to the court. The four players each won their service games, making the score 2-2. Lin and Qiu were extremely careful, and sure enough, they won five consecutive games. In the fourth set, they won 6-2, bringing the score back to 2-2. They also won a game in the fifth set. At this point, Huite gradually showed signs of exhaustion. Although Karna Fanluo was still radiant, he could not do it alone. Lin and Qiu's victory in the fourth set was only due to the opponent's decline. In the final deciding set, the opening three games of Qiu, Huite, and Lin all went to Qiu and Lin, and the victory was sealed at 6-2. Finally, Lin and Qiu retained the championship 3-2. In the last two games, both sides performed many exciting volleys.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Karna Fanluo Shine: Lin Baohua fully recovered to his normal state yesterday, which was satisfactory. Qiu Feihai was far worse, Karna and Huite were showing off. This double-handed master, Karna Fanluo, was the bravest on the court, advancing and retreating with skill, and unleashing his power with interceptions. He took care of every angle with his shots, but unfortunately Huite was slightly inferior and not good at delivering the final blow, which was a pity.</p>

<h3>Letter from Mr. Shen Guoquan of Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Shen Guoquan, Director of Physical Education at Jiaotong University, states: "We respectfully inform you that upon reading your newspaper's report on the athletes who were absent from the Shanghai Municipal Games, one of them was Chen Dekun, a student of our university. Upon investigation, this person registered on September 5th, but suddenly fell ill on the 6th, fearing that he would not be able to participate in the event. Therefore, he sent a letter to the Education Bureau on the same day, requesting to withdraw, so as not to be absent. Now, reading what is published in your newspaper, we believe it is a mistake. Our university students have always been deeply devoted to sports and have a great spirit, not determining whether to compete based on the gain or loss of the championship. This time, it was indeed due to illness that he withdrew, and not because he knew it was difficult and did not attend. We hereby make a solemn statement, hoping that your newspaper will correct this. Respectfully to the chief editor of Shen Bao, Shen Guoquan, Director of Physical Education at Jiaotong University. (Editor's note: Yesterday, we found that Mr. Chen Dekun's number cloth and badge were signed for by Mr. Li Xinbiao to the conference.)"</p>
<p>Eagle Team Reinvigorates</p>
<p>Our team was established five years ago. During this period, some team members were hindered by their studies and were unable to serve our team. The rest have been serving society, resulting in fewer opportunities for practice. Now that the basketball season is approaching again, we are reorganizing and continuing to participate in the basketball games of the Chinese and Xiqing associations. It is now scheduled to hold a general meeting of all members on the 19th of this month, i.e. (Saturday), at No. 6 Lingshengfang, Baoshan Road.</p>

<p>丨200-Meter Breaststroke Ties National Record丨</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Jiangnan University Swimming Meet. No fewer than 400 men and women came to visit the Xu Jiahui swimming pool. The sun was shining brightly, shining straight down from the sky, and the whole place was filled with spring. At exactly 2 o'clock, the competition began. Each competition was quite intense. The audience was very interested, and the athletes were in excellent spirits. As a result of the competition, Jinan University scored a total of 33 points in the men's division and 13 points in the women's division. Both the men's and women's championships of the second session were won by the school. The details of the competition are attached below:</p>
<h3>Competition Summary</h3>
<p>In the 50-meter freestyle, a total of five people qualified for the final. It was difficult to distinguish who was ahead when swimming to the 25-meter turn. It was not until the end that Lian Xiannan took the lead over Yin Yanjun by a foot and won first place. Although Lian is good at swimming, his turning action is quite slow, which is the only flaw.</p>
<p>In the 400-meter freestyle, a total of sixteen laps were required. Zheng Guizhang and Yin Yanjun took the lead in the first 100 meters. Then, Lin Chaoyuan worked harder and accelerated. By the thirteenth lap, he had surpassed Zheng and Yin and ranked first. Subsequently, Ling Chongju also worked hard to win glory, becoming second. Until the end, Yin tried his best to paddle in the last 50 meters, causing him to gasp for breath and lie on the ground when he landed. The fierceness of the competition can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the 100-meter backstroke, Yi Qixiang and Cao Songwan kept pace with each other from beginning to end. Yi used both arms to paddle together, while Cao and Yin used single arms to exchange paddling. The difference in victory or defeat was only determined in the last few meters.</p>
<p>In the 1,500-meter freestyle, five people competed in the final, requiring a total of 60 laps. In the first 14 laps, Lin Chaoyuan and Zheng Guizhang swam shoulder to shoulder with each other. Huang Dazhu followed behind the two. By the 26th lap, Huang was overtaken by Xu Zhenfang and became fourth. By the 28th lap, he was overtaken by Yi Qixiang and fell behind, becoming the last place. Until the 50th lap, Zheng was only two meters ahead of Lin. However, by the end, he had exceeded Lin by 25 meters. When Lin reached the destination, Xu Zhenfang was still more than 120 meters away. When Xu reached it, he was 20 meters ahead of Yi. This is a general overview of the competition.</p>
<p>In the 200-meter breaststroke, Ling Chongju led alone from the start of the race. It can be said that Ling has mastered the mysteries of the frog-style kick. Each kick is powerful and far-reaching, making other competitors unable to catch up with the splashing water. Therefore, he was able to tie Ma Zhihui's national record of 3 minutes and 28 seconds, which was maintained in the eighth Far Eastern preliminary round. It is truly commendable. We hope that Ling will work harder and take it to the next level. Zhong Langxuan, a young talent, was able to win second place, which is very gratifying. Fu Kaixian's movements were too fast when swimming, so it was difficult to get good results. If he can change this, the time can definitely be reduced. We hope Fu will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Shanghai People Rise Up to Oppose Japan</h3>
<p>Various Sectors Expressed Yesterday</p>
<p>Internal Unity and Solidarity</p>
<p>Vowing to Resist Japan to the Death</p>
<p>The Japanese military's violent occupation of the Eastern Provinces was known to few the day before yesterday. As of yesterday, after the newspapers revealed this news, people in Shanghai were extremely indignant. All kinds of expressions are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>All Northeast Telecommunications Cut Off</h3>
<p>Landline Telegrams Only Reach Jinzhou</p>
<p>Harbin Radio Interrupted</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military occupied Shenyang and other places, all communication organs in the Northeast have been under the control of the Japanese. According to news from the Landline Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation in this city yesterday, telegrams from this city to the three northeastern provinces used to be sent to Tianjin, then transferred to Shenyang, and then transferred to various parts of the three northeastern provinces. Since Shenyang was occupied, telegrams to various parts of the three northeastern provinces have been completely cut off. As of 6 PM yesterday, telegrams to the Northeast only reached Jinzhou. As for the submarine cable, it went from the Shanghai-Yantai line to Dalian, then to Shenyang, and then to various places. Now, it only reaches Dalian. Yesterday, there was a huge crowd at the telegraph office sending telegrams to Shenyang. Most of them were family members and relatives in Shanghai inquiring about safety. The bureau replied that it was not possible to send the telegrams, but they insisted on sending them, trying to give it a shot. Who doesn't have family? How could they not feel sad? As for radio telegrams, except for Harbin, all parts of the Northeast were also cut off. However, by noon yesterday, Harbin's telegrams were also cut off. The reason is unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Reply to Kong Xiangxi's Telegram</h3>
<p>Please Announce to the World</p>
<p>To Arouse International Sympathy</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang replied to Kong Xiangxi's telegram yesterday, saying, "To Minister Kong, Yongzhi brother, upon perusing your letter, [illegible], regarding the details of the Japanese military occupying Shenyang, I have repeatedly sent telegrams to report. I hope you will investigate. Now, because transportation and communication organs have been completely blocked, since 7 AM, the situation is unclear. As for Yingkou, according to the Beining Railway Bureau's news and the reports from the garrison troops stationed in Goubangzi, the Japanese military also took the same actions. Our side did not resist. Today, Tang Erhe went to meet with the acting Japanese consul general to question this matter. He pushed it aside, saying he didn't know about it. I am very grateful for your instructions on how to deal with it. I have already instructed the military and civilian officials under my command to remain calm temporarily so that they have no excuse. I have also reported to the central government, requesting that you take charge nearby, announce to the world as soon as possible to arouse international sympathy, and quickly arrange proper measures. Just as I was sending the telegram, I received a report that Changchun and Andong have also taken the same actions. The details are not yet clear. Brother Zhang Xueliang, [illegible]."</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Circular Telegram to Cease Internal Conflict and Confront External Aggression</h3>
<p>Shared Fate Through Thick and Thin, Together Through Difficulties</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee Member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, sent a circular telegram to the Northern and Southern military and political authorities and all sectors of the country yesterday regarding the current situation, saying, "To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government, Vice Commander Zhang in Beiping, Mr. Wang Jingwei in Guangzhou, Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Gu Xiangqin, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Xu Chongzhi, Mr. Bai Jiansheng, Mr. Zhang Fakui, all gentlemen, and the Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou newspaper offices, transferred to all organizations and compatriots across the country, the national fortune is in decline, and disasters are coming one after another. The provinces have been severely hit by floods, affecting more than 50 million people. Even with the strength of the whole country, there is still concern that there is not enough time to save the dying. Now, alarming news has come that the Japanese have taken advantage of this crisis and openly dispatched troops to Liaoning Province. They have been planning and plotting this for a long time, but we, who have been enduring hardship, have not prepared for it in peacetime. Forgetting the danger of an overturned nest, we are still boiling beans with their stalks. The disaster is imminent, and there is no greater grief than the death of the heart. Can anyone in the country not be alarmed? For years, Qinglan has been engaged in disaster relief, running around and appealing, hoping to preserve the vitality of the country and make a modest contribution. Although I am always ashamed of my lack of strength, I will not hesitate to do so. As for national political affairs, there are people in charge, and I have never made any overstepping remarks. Now that the country is being invaded and the people are dying every day, I cannot remain silent. I hereby speak out on behalf of the disaster victims of the whole country, appealing to all parties in power to think calmly. What grudges cannot be resolved today? What political views cannot be sacrificed? In the decades of life, what is most important? Moreover, with imminent danger, it is difficult to keep the eggs intact. I hope that all the wise men and heroes from all walks of life will be aware of the imminent collapse of the roof and attach the vines to the mulberry tree. Let the whole country unite, rise up in one body, share the fate through thick and thin, and overcome difficulties together. I have spoken frankly, and I hope you will all understand. Zhu Qinglan."</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Telegram to the Guangdong Authorities</h3>
<p>Unite With One Heart to Relieve the National Crisis Together</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi sent a telegram to the Guangdong authorities yesterday, saying, "[omitted the beginning] Suddenly alarming news has come that the Japanese military has openly declared war on our people and occupied our Shenyang, Andong, Changchun, and other ports. If this is tolerable, what is not? The country will not be a country. Anyone with blood and breath will be indignant. At this time when foreign aggression is being imposed horizontally, it is the time for us to strive for survival. I hope that all comrades, who have personally followed the Premier and been nurtured for a long time, will set aside temporary emotions, uphold the Premier's legacy of saving the country, unite with one heart to relieve the national crisis together, show the revolutionary character of all comrades, and preserve the independent sovereignty of our country. I am sending this telegram with a restless heart, awaiting your clear instruction. Kong Xiangxi."</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian Agrees with Sun Ke's Proposal</h3>
<p>Strive for Peace and Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian telegraphed Sun Ke yesterday, saying, "To Brother Sun Zhesheng in Guangzhou, upon reading the report in the Dalu Daily regarding your circular telegram, advocating for peace and resisting aggression, I deeply believe that you are truly a person who loves the party and loves the country. The Premier struggled to establish the party and the country, and it is no different for the party and the country to be restored. It must be someone who is able to comfort the spirits in heaven and avert the crisis in the nick of time. Therefore, I deeply believe that the report is accurate, and I cannot help but feel comforted and moved. I hope you will work hard. If there is anything I can do, I am willing to serve you."</p>
<h3>Our Protest Letter Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency stated that according to the message from the Shanghai office of the Japanese embassy, the emergency protest letter submitted by our side has been sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Uemura, the Japanese consul general stationed in Beijing, and Mr. Shigemitsu received the notification yesterday morning, and received the full text only in the evening, and that Shigemitsu had sent a telegram of it to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, but as the Japanese government has not yet received it as of yesterday evening, it has not allowed its publication.</p>

<p>Organize Volunteer Corps to Face the National Crisis Together</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association convened an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at 4 PM yesterday, with more than 30 members attending.

The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Submit a petition to the Central Government requesting that it concentrate the national troops, immediately send troops to the three northeastern provinces, and expel the Japanese troops from the country.

<p>Open Talk Sessions, Each Sharing Their Opinions</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese Association issued an emergency notice a few days ago, representatives from all walks of life who heard the news and came yesterday afternoon numbered in the thousands. The auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was blocked. The Anti-Japanese Association, considering the concern for the national crisis and the commendable enthusiasm of the representatives from all walks of life, elected Committee Member Wang Xiaolai to attend and hold a talk session. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the situation and hoped that all sectors would express their opinions as much as possible so that they could be submitted to the committee, and then a general meeting of all sectors of the city would be convened to discuss countermeasures. This is truly a critical moment for the survival of our country. We must cease internal conflict, unite, and jointly confront external aggression. Then, Chen Binhe, Wu Mai, and others successively expressed their opinions. Committee Member Wang Xiaolai accepted them one by one and handed them over to the Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Meetings of Various Groups</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Expressions from Various Circles</h3>
<p>Second District Party Headquarters' Resolutions: The Second District Party Headquarters convened a temporary emergency meeting of all executive committee members yesterday at 9:00 AM and made the following serious resolutions: (1) Request the central government to announce to all compatriots throughout the country to abandon personal prejudices and jointly face the national crisis; (2) Request the central government to exert its full force and prepare to confront Japan; (3) Request the central government to order all party members across the country to be armed and order the Director-General of Training to promptly dispatch officers to various local party headquarters to implement training, and order the Ministry of Education to instruct all universities and middle schools to organize student armies to serve as examples for the people; (4) The Northeast authorities showed no prior precautions and were cowardly in the face of events, truly committing the crime of failing to defend the country. The central government should be requested to dismiss and severely punish them to appease the people; (5) Request the central government to promptly dismiss the weak and incompetent Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and select virtuous and capable individuals to deal with this difficult situation; (6) Request the municipal party headquarters to order the municipal anti-Japanese association to intensify its work.

Those who serve the Japanese should resign from their positions on a set date to show their determination; (8) Request the municipal party headquarters to send letters to all newspapers in the city to publish anti-Japanese news and the atrocities of Japanese soldiers as much as possible to spread propaganda; (9) Issue orders to the branch offices in each district and to the permanent propaganda teams to set out and publicize the brutal situation of the Japanese to promote the attention of all citizens in the district; (10) This committee will issue another declaration, etc.</p>
<p>Fifth District Party Headquarters' Telegram: All compatriots across the country, please be aware that like a bolt from the blue, Japan has again used armed forces to invade and occupy the Northeast! The imperialistic ambition of Japan to invade and occupy Manchuria and Mongolia has long been openly revealed. The recent Wanbaoshan Incident and the tragic massacre of our overseas Chinese by Koreans are particularly prominent examples. Who would have thought that before the bloodstains of the Korean case were dry, the Japanese imperialists would intensify their actions, using the so-called "Nakamura Incident" as an excuse to invade and occupy Shenyang and Changchun. This action by the Japanese not only violates international law but also destroys peace in East Asia. If this can be done, what cannot be done? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The Party Headquarters of this district believes that the seriousness of this incident far exceeds the Jinan and Xifeng cases. The rise and fall of the nation and the survival of the race depend on this one action. The situation is urgent! We hope that our compatriots will rise up and, under the guidance of this party, actively attack Japan, holding the determination that "either Japan will perish and we will survive, or we will perish and Japan will survive," and fight a death struggle with Japan. Compatriots, compatriots, our heads can be cut off, and our blood can flow, but our beautiful land must not be invaded and occupied by the Japanese. Strive, strive, rather die resisting Japan than live following Japan. We wish to encourage each other. Respectfully submitted, hoping for your careful consideration. The Executive Committee of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Special City of the Chinese Nationalist Party respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Sixth District Party Headquarters' Telegram: Extremely Urgent (Omitted titles) Japanese imperialists, wielding their utterly wicked and ferocious power, and in the absence of any resistance, forcibly occupied Shenyang and other important places. This is the only expression of their desire to destroy international credibility, disrupt world peace, and enslave our people. If we have even one iota of spirit, we should be determined to burn our boats and sink them and have the ambition to endure hardship and share bitterness and engage in a final struggle with them. I also know that the national strength is inherently weak, internal strife has not ceased, floods occur frequently, and the people's livelihood is declining. Under the current national crisis, it seems that there is no room for resistance. Do not know they rely on power, we rely on justice; they rely on military force, we rely on righteousness. As long as there is a breath, we will jointly resist aggression. Then, opening the mouths of the Edo River to wash away the shame of national humiliation, we do not worry about failing to achieve the purpose. It is only that our country has the chronic disease of "five minutes of heat" and that every time we experience a national humiliation, it dissipates like clouds and rain in a few months. Therefore, the blood of the May 3rd Massacre is not yet cold, and the flames of discrimination against the Chinese in Korea are burning again. One wave has not subsided, and another wave rises. In summary, the main point is that the Chinese people's resistance is weak and is despised by the Japanese. Therefore, in the future, our only way out should be to gather the strength of the entire nation to serve as an iron and bloody backing for diplomacy. At the same time, we must also sever economic ties for a hundred years to seek a peaceful path to survival. The tragedy of national subjugation is imminent. All our citizens, why don't you rise up? Although Japan has long been determined to invade Manchuria and Mongolia, if our country has no internal strife and no Red disaster within the walls, then even if Japan is strong, what can it do to us? Therefore, today's unprecedented humiliation of the country is not only not pardonable by Guangdong and Guangxi, but also those who are selfish and do not work together to save the country are our common enemies. This committee vows to fight to the death and will not hesitate. We only hope that our government and people, from top to bottom, will take September 19th as a day of national mourning, mourn together, break the illusion of relying on foreigners, and from today onwards, unite the strength of the entire nation to take measures to save the country. No matter how difficult, as long as we adhere to our Premier's sincere and pure revolutionary spirit and pass it on forever, then restoring national self-confidence and overthrowing Japanese imperialism will be within reach. The national crisis is at hand, and our blood is exhausted. We painfully call out, hoping to weep together. The Executive Committee of the Sixth District Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Shanghai Special City, telegram. The Seventh District Party Headquarters Telegram: The Seventh District Party Headquarters of this city issued a telegram yesterday, saying (Omitted titles) The news reported that at 6:00 AM yesterday, the brutal Japanese army had attacked and occupied our three eastern provinces. The situation in the Northeast is critical. After reading the news, the Party Headquarters of this district was extremely indignant. Upon investigation, Japanese imperialism has been planning and scheming for more than just a day. The bloodstains of Jinan are still there, and the corpses of overseas Chinese in Korea still remain. Taking advantage of our urgent internal troubles and sudden natural disasters, they disregard natural disasters, have no sympathy for human suffering, and act against humanity. They took advantage of the time of people's crisis and suddenly dispatched heavy troops to occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and other places. Their barbaric and brutal behavior is not only not tolerated by international law, but it is also not appropriate for neighboring countries of the same culture and race to do this. The Party Headquarters of this district is pained by the imminent national crisis and is determined that verbal disputes will not be effective. We sincerely hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will unite and pledge to destroy the Japanese. The Party Headquarters of this district will send a special telegram to the central government to announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, send troops immediately, and recover our territory. The survival of the nation and the glory of the nation depend on this one action. We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up and plan for it urgently. The telegram cannot express all of our indignation. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>Two-Railway Party Headquarters' Telegram: To all newspaper offices for forwarding to all compatriots across the country. Alas, China has suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism for a long time. The "May 9th" and "May 3rd" incidents, the great humiliation, are deeply imprinted in our minds, and we think day and night of how to deal with them. Unexpectedly, Japanese imperialists have recently engaged in aggression even worse than "May 9th" and "May 3rd," actively plotting to seize our Manchuria and Mongolia and coveting our Central Plains. Previously, they staged the unprecedented Wan-Korean massacre, instigating Korean mobs to oppress and shoot our compatriots, with blood filling the cities and fields, and plundering our property, worth countless thousands. Their trampling on the nation and contempt for national rights have reached this point. All those with blood and spirit, who would not be filled with grief and indignation, and whose eyes would not be cracked and hair would not stand on end? Following the Wan-Korean incident, they used the so-called trumped-up Nakamura incident to suddenly occupy our Shenyang and Changchun with military force by extraordinary means. The news of the alert came, and we were filled with extreme hatred. What can the country and nation endure if justice is destroyed in this way? Are we not to be fish and meat on the chopping block for others? Alas, compatriots, the end is near. At this critical moment for the country, at this autumn of the people's crisis of survival, the only thing to do is for the whole country, from top to bottom, to be of one heart and one mind, to quell the boiling of the same roots, to seek a way of self-salvation, to resist foreign insults, and to return our rivers and mountains. Swords and shoes are ready, and we will rise up together to face the national crisis, even to death. The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways of the Chinese Nationalist Party, telegram.</p>
<p>Minhang Anti-Japanese Meeting Resolutions: Taking advantage of our country's floods and internal strife, Japan suddenly sent troops to the eastern provinces and forcibly occupied our land. When the news of the alert came, all those with blood and spirit were filled with extreme indignation. The Minhang All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee convened a temporary emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and resolved: (1) To send telegrams to various regions, advocating the elimination of internal strife, uniting against a common enemy, and unanimously confronting foreign enemies; (2) To send a telegram urging the National Government to promptly make proper arrangements for countermeasures; (3) The work of all departments of this committee should be intensified with concerted efforts; (4) To send letters to all districts, townships, and towns in the county to promptly organize anti-Japanese associations and implement economic severance; (5) To create an anti-Japanese oath, distribute it to the people in the entire district, and swear to resist Japan to the death; (6) To organize propaganda teams to go to various townships and towns to conduct propaganda, and to print slogans and paste them on major roads and on passing boats and vehicles to arouse attention, etc.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Union Telegram: To all newspaper offices for forwarding to all compatriots across the country, for your public review, Japan suddenly dispatched heavy troops to occupy our Shenyang, Andong, Yingkou, and other places, and sent fleets south, intending to seize Qingdao and then plot against our entire country. Their wolfish ambitions and jackal hearts will not stop until they swallow our country and exterminate our race. When the alarming telegram came, it felt like being shot in the heart, like being crushed to pieces by a knife. Alas, if our countrymen do not save themselves and save the country, then becoming a continuation of Korea and Taiwan for Japan will not be far away. Alas, internal troubles are urgent, and natural disasters are raging. Can we not bear the pain of awakening after reading the central government's encouraging words and face the national crisis together? At this autumn of national crisis and imminent danger, the people of the whole country should strengthen their original organizations, create a strong unity under the guidance of the central government, consolidate the foundation of the country, strengthen the government's power, and exhaust the plans of the masses to jointly resist foreign insults. This union adheres to its doctrines, remains unchanged, and is mindful of the danger to the motherland. The loss of our rivers and mountains pains our hearts like pounding, and righteous indignation fills our chests. Therefore, following the central government's encouragement to unite and bearing in mind that every citizen is responsible for the country's affairs, we vow to lead more than 30,000 postal workers across the country to strengthen the original organizations in various regions and strive for disaster relief and defense work. Self-rescue and self-improvement are the only way. This telegram is sent with the hope that we will strive to plan. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Publishing Industry Union Telegram: (Omitted titles) In today's world where peace is being touted, the Japanese imperialists have forgotten the slogan of coexistence and co-prosperity and have dared to defy the world and seize our land in the eastern provinces, arrest our administrative officials, and massacre our innocent poor people. This is not only disrupting the peace of East Asia and destroying international credibility, but it is also a brutal event that has never been seen in civilized history. Moreover, they are taking advantage of our days of suffering brought about by the combined force of natural and man-made disasters to wield the power of free action. (Paragraph omitted) Although we are in a situation of national disintegration and economic decline, we have encountered an unprecedented alarm of national destruction, which is the greatest misfortune among all misfortunes. However, if the people of the whole country can hold the determination to burn their boats and sink them and endure hardship and share bitterness, I dare say that we still have the opportunity to freely print and typeset a glorious history of saving the country and saving the nation. Therefore, in the last minute when all tears have dried up and all blood has been shed, I still hope that my cold-blooded and half-dead compatriots will recognize the only way out for national self-salvation and wield the iron and bloody doctrine of joint efforts to resist power. At the same time, I also hope that those ignorant people who are tainted by the red disaster and those generals who are fighting internally will immediately lay down their butcher knives and jointly resist foreign insults. Do not create a stage for national suicide to be used as war trophies in the activities of girls in purple skirts in photographs. Although we do not have the power to wave the spear of Lu Yang to wash away the national humiliation that has not been forgotten for nine generations, we dare to complete the work of restoring the national status under the leadership of the blue and white banner. As long as the people's hearts do not die, I believe that our last drop of blood and a little tear can still print the most beautiful and most tragic book of national salvation.</p>
<p>Telegram from the French Concession Taxpayers' Association: To the Nanjing National Government, your Excellency: This association recently sent a telegram to Guangzhou, saying that Japan has long harbored ambitions to invade our Manchuria and Mongolia. Recently, taking advantage of the Nakamura Incident, they suddenly used artillery fire on the evening of the 18th to attack our Shenyang and forcibly occupy the entire eastern provinces. Their inhuman and perverse actions are truly intolerable to heaven and earth. If our compatriots do not strive to plan for self-salvation, national subjugation and racial extinction are imminent. We humbly request that you eliminate prejudices, quickly end the war at home, unite and work together to rise up and resist foreign insults, destroy them as soon as we eat breakfast, to save the situation in case of emergency. Our people vow to be the backing of all of you, urgently state our words, and await orders. The French Concession Taxpayers' Association of Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<p>Declarations from Various Trade Associations: The lead printing industry, the mineral ash factory industry, the flying flower industry, the southern goods industry, the western pigment industry, the lime sales industry, the rental car industry, the yellow sand crushed stone industry, and more than thirty other trade associations issued declarations, saying (Above omitted) Japanese imperialists, using the Nakamura case as an excuse, sent large armies to invade and occupy the Northeast. All those who belong to the human race are filled with hatred and indignation. Upon investigation, the Japanese imperialists' plan to swallow our country has been premeditated for a long time. From afar, there were the "Twenty-One Demands" and the "May 3rd" Incident. More recently, there were the Wan Incident and the Korean Incident. All of these treat our</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>country as meat on a chopping block, and they are still not satisfied. They dare to make groundless accusations, fabricate the Nakamura case, send troops to land everywhere, and arbitrarily massacre people. There are also reports of advancing troops into Peiping. If this can be tolerated, national subjugation is only a matter of time. If we still recognize ourselves as citizens of the Republic of China, we should all exhaust our intelligence and strength, regardless of divisions or boundaries, and work together to resist foreign insults. This association and others hold the principle of "better to be a broken jade than a whole tile." At this time of natural disasters, man-made disasters, and national crisis, the brutal Japanese have taken such a strong and reckless action to invade our Northeast and implement their so-called Manchuria-Mongolia policy. The crisis of national survival is imminent. With the national crisis at hand, how can we sit idly by? Striving and fighting is our undeniable duty. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. All our compatriots must be of one heart and one mind and strive to resist insults. If human justice still exists, then justice will naturally be upheld. The brutal Japan will surely be sanctioned by the world. It can be asserted. Compatriots, quickly use all your strength to resist the brutality of Japan. The survival of the nation and the success or failure of the race depend on this one action. We earnestly hope that we will rise up together and engage in a desperate fight to perish together. This declaration is made with solemnity.</p>
<p>Coal Industry Association Telegram: To all farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers across the country, for your public review: The treacherous Japanese soldiers attacked Liaoning, killed our compatriots, seized our military equipment, occupied our land, and destroyed our barracks. When the fierce telegram arrived, heaven and men were filled with indignation. Our compatriots, at this time when floods and internal strife have not subsided, Japanese soldiers came to attack without any resistance. Their destruction of peace in East Asia and annihilation of international law are known to all. The cruel, brutal, and evil Japan, although said to be taking advantage of our suffering to attack without chivalry and taking advantage of our disaster to invade without benevolence, if our compatriots focus solely on appealing to international law, even if it can be redressed, it will ultimately be slow. Now, at a time of imminent danger, we earnestly request that we unanimously make the following propositions: (1) Please, all members of the Guangdong Committee, abandon previous grievances and return to the central government to unanimously resist foreign aggression. At the same time, please, all members of the Central Government in charge, also abandon previous grievances, welcome the return of the Guangdong Committee, and jointly resist foreign aggression. (2) Please, the Central Government, promptly appeal to international law regarding the unjust and brutal act of Japanese soldiers invading and occupying Liaoning, seeking justice from the nations. (3) Please, all the current high-ranking officials of the government, arouse their conscience, eliminate selfish desires, understand the metaphor of the skin surviving when the hair is attached, follow the late Premier's instructions to live a life of integrity, and work together with the people to save the situation in crisis. (4) Please, all fair, honest, and upright gentlemen of various legal entities, quickly organize mass national salvation agencies, accept the contributions of compatriots for national salvation, and at the same time, please, all our compatriots, rise up together to carry out various material national salvation activities. The above four points are the most urgent tasks for our compatriots today. We respectfully request unanimous support and full effort. Coal industry colleagues vow to follow. The telegram is urgent, hoping for your clear understanding. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Citizens' United Association Telegram: To all farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers across the country, for your public review: Japanese soldiers invaded and attacked our key areas in Liaoning, brutally killing our soldiers and civilians, and destroying our ordnance factories and warehouses. When the fierce news arrived, the whole country was shocked. Although the arrival of foreign insults is due to internal strife, can we ask if the pain of national subjugation can be an exception? Japan has long harbored ambitions to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Knowing this and failing to prepare, regret is too late. This is the autumn of danger for our countrymen, who should rise up urgently to save the situation, without allowing the slightest delay. Japanese soldiers, taking advantage of our country's floods and the red bandits' disturbances, drove troops to invade our Northeast territory for thousands of miles, killing and injuring thousands of our compatriots, stealing livestock and horses by the thousands, and destroying countless utensils and properties. Their inhuman, unchivalrous, barbaric, and brutal acts are unprecedented in history. The Northeast authorities of our country, who did not resist, wanted to preserve peace in East Asia and respect international law. However, Japan disregarded everything, destroyed peace, jumped over the law, and completely exposed its evil intentions. If we talk about humanity, Japan's barbaric actions this time are truly the public enemy of the world. If it is not removed for a day, it will be difficult for humanity to survive. Unfortunately, our country has not yet recovered from the floods, and foreign disasters have suddenly arrived. If we do not rise up to resist, destruction is imminent. But thinking that the various members of the central government have not abandoned their private grievances, how can we expect unity in resisting foreign insults? We deeply hope that all compatriots will quickly make the following propositions: (1) Please, all members of the Guangdong Committee, immediately abandon previous grievances, send telegrams to return, and jointly resist foreign insults. The central government should also express its welcome so as to achieve the effect of unity. (2) The central government should promptly appeal to international law regarding the fact that Japan invaded and attacked Liaoning, seeking justice from various countries. (3) Compatriots should unanimously first engage in material national salvation movements, quickly organize mass national salvation groups, and purchase national defense weapons. (4) Train national salvation troops. (5) Implement economic severance with Japan. The above five points are the most urgent tasks. This association vows to fulfill its duties and strive to achieve them. The telegram is urgent, hoping for a united response. The Shanghai Special Zone Citizens' United Association respectfully kowtows.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang</p>
<p>Please Plan Comprehensively for the Accommodation of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Association received a telegram from Zhang Zhijiang yesterday, saying: Mr. Song Yuwen of the Nanjing Flood Relief Committee, Mr. Xu Junren of the Relief Committee, Chairman Ye Chucang of Zhenjiang, and all gentlemen of the Shanghai Renjitang Provincial Flood Relief Associations and the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association: According to Commissioners Yuan Shengmei and Cao Yuezhong of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, since the dike breached in the Gao-Shao area and the Yan-Xing regions were completely flooded, disaster victims have been fleeing everywhere. In order to meet the urgent needs of the moment, it has been necessary to temporarily set up accommodation centers to provide relief. However, it is currently found that in the corner of Yangzhou alone, accommodation centers have already reached more than 4,000 disaster victims, and the accommodation centers are extremely crowded. According to this place's capacity, it can only accommodate another thousand people at most, beyond which there is no way to continue. The number of disaster victims coming from various regions is still endless. Based on this speculation, not only have problems arisen with the disaster victims' food, clothing, medicine, and hygiene, as well as local security, but there will also be no place to accommodate them. In terms of Jiangbei alone, this method is truly difficult to sustain. For the sake of long-term planning, it seems appropriate to plan comprehensively and devise a proper method of relief. In my humble opinion, it seems that each of the disaster-stricken county towns can be instructed to establish accommodation centers separately by the local officials and gentry to accommodate as many disaster victims as possible. This can both spare the grief of displaced refugees and avoid the difficulty of accommodating them in a narrow area. Other matters that should be planned and considered in detail also seem to be determined and completed as soon as possible by your department, which is more appropriate. Jiang resides near the disaster area, hears and sees more closely, and cannot remain silent. I pray for your wise decision. Zhang Zhijiang kowtows.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng Concurrently Appointed as Special Commissioner for Relief Affairs in the Northern Jiangsu Area</p>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee, for the sake of facilitating disaster relief, has divided the affected area into districts, each with a special commissioner in charge of affairs. Director Cheng Jingsheng of the Committee has now been appointed as the Special Commissioner for Relief Affairs in the Northern Jiangsu area and has already departed to organize an office in the hope of commencing work soon.</p>
<p>Protection of Farm Cattle: After the breach at Gao Shao, the flood disaster intensified. Farmers have nowhere to settle, and farm cattle have nowhere to be sheltered. Cattle brokers are taking the opportunity to buy up cattle at low prices and resell them for slaughter. If this is not prohibited, the cattle population will be depleted, which will inevitably delay spring plowing. Recognizing this, the committee is vigorously promoting livestock protection. The Department of Agriculture and Mining also has a clear order for livestock protection. It is reported that Huaiyin, Bao'ying, Sishui, Jiangdu, and Jiangpu are actively preparing for it.</p>
<p>Transportation of Relief Goods: Disaster area refugees are without clothing and food, and many are on the verge of death. Yesterday, the committee telegraphed the National Government Flood Relief Committee, specially requesting the Ministry of Railways to order the bureau to prepare trains to transport 11,600 bags of flour and 1,500 bags of rice to Zhenjiang and Nanjing, and 10,000 pieces of relief clothing to Zhenjiang, to be distributed to disaster victims in various places, in the hope of temporarily sustaining lives in this desperate situation.</p>
<p>Appeal to Open the Seawall: We recently received a joint telegram from various public organizations in Xinghua, which reads: "To the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, with respect: Although the Dafeng Yuhua and Ge Mao You Rivers have been opened successively, after investigation, the width of the outlet is less than 30 zhang. The newly opened 800 zhang connecting to Wanggang is the length. The upper opening is only 4.2 zhang wide, the lower opening is 1.8 zhang wide, and 5 chi high. The flow is not smooth and is still useless. Now, Mr. Sun Xiumiu, a member of the Shanghai Jisheng Association, together with representatives from Xingdong County, has surveyed that in the uncultivated area of ​​Dafeng Company, there are six horizontal long embankment dikes, each of which is 15 li long, obstructing the drainage of water. It is proposed to open 810 flat breaches, opening 10 zhang every 20 zhang, which can increase the amount of seawater discharged, with a width of 1,350 zhang and a water height of 3 chi above the beach, spreading flat into the sea without damaging the cultivated land of the company. Moreover, Mr. Zhu Jingci, the representative of the company, agreed and approved. Section Chief Chen Zhan'en of the Ministry of Interior and Committee Member Xu Ji of the Department of Construction also believe that this is the most important method. In addition to Mr. Sun directly telegraphing your association for review and approval, the enemy county also telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Yangzhou Pacification Supervisor for record. We hereby jointly request a telegram to your association to quickly review and approve the telegram for implementation. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. Respectfully, Wu Guangguo, Standing Committee Member of the Xinghua County Party Department; Hua Zhen, Magistrate of Xinghua County; Wei Chonggeng, Director of the Xinghua County Farmers' Association; Gu Shunan, Chairman of the Xinghua County Chamber of Commerce; Pan Dejun, Executive Director of the Xinghua County Education Association; Shi Mingyong, Standing Committee Member of the Temporary Disaster Relief Association, etc., kowtow in appeal."</p>
<p>League of Nations Disaster Relief Committee to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the International League of Nations has sent Secretary Cedric Watter and another person to China to inspect the disaster situation. They have already arrived in Beijing by train and are scheduled to come to Shanghai within the next few days to jointly discuss cooperation in relief efforts with the Flood Relief Committee and collect reports on the famine in various provinces to send to the League of Nations in preparation for sending a second batch of specialists to China to handle relief matters. The National Government Flood Relief Committee is awaiting the arrival of the secretaries in Shanghai to hold a welcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Eighth Regular Meeting of the Anhui Relief Association</p>
<p>The Anhui Flood Relief Association in Shanghai held its eighth regular meeting yesterday. Chairman Li Cishan, (A) Reported Matters: (1) The chairman reported on the situation of the counties requesting relief. (2) Committee Member Wang Zhuru reported on going to Hangzhou to contact the Anhui Guild Hall for assistance in relief, and 500 yuan has been remitted, as well as the organization of the Anhui Flood Relief Association in Zhejiang and the situation of the refugees it is receiving. (B) Resolutions: (1) Send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and its board of directors, requesting that the company's ships carry refugees back to their hometowns when they sail. (2) Telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government to speed up the organization of the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, and telegraph Yan Zhuang to inquire about the distribution of relief funds. (3) Send a letter to the liaison group of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee to report the value and number of relief funds and all miscellaneous items raised by the association for verification. (4) Send a letter to the National Government Flood Relief Committee requesting the allocation of funds for dam construction in Wuwei and Xuancheng counties. (5) Appoint Committee Members Li Zhenya, Zhu Runbin, and Cao Zhigong to attend the symposium of party and government agencies and various relief organizations convened by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. (6) Suggest to the Provincial Government to prohibit strong liquor in various counties to avoid wasting allocated grain, and at the same time prohibit the import of liquor from other places. (7) Allocate 2,000 bottles of Sha Yao water and hand them over to Committee Member Jiang Zhifu for forwarding to Huaiyuan County for epidemic prevention. (8) Send a letter to the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Department, various county governments, and county party departments to supervise relief efforts. (9) Appoint Committee Member Li Zhenya to draft punitive regulations and suggest that the central government issue a general order to various counties for implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, Ding Xizhai, a representative from Wuwei requesting relief, recently arrived in Shanghai from the interior. At the eighth regular meeting, he reported the disaster situation as follows: The water defenses of Wuwei County are of great importance to the interests of Shu, Lu, Chao, He, and Han counties. However, if there are preventive measures in advance, it is not impossible to reduce the disaster. For example, in the years 2 and 3 of the Republic of China, although there were repeated floods, fortunately, the county's prevention and rescue efforts were effective, so the embankments were not breached. This year, the water level in Wuwei is higher than that of the 3rd year of Xuantong, inundating 1 million mu of embankment fields and 500,000 mu of island land, killing more than 10,000 cattle and thousands of disaster victims. Countless disaster victims are without clothing, food, or shelter. If it gets cold, those who do not die of hunger will die of cold. At present, the fundamental relief measures should be to repair the embankments and the protective embankments on the island. The total cost of labor and food alone will not be less than 3 million yuan to complete the project. It is proposed to ask the association to forward the request to the National Government for allocation.</p>
<p>Summary of the Report on Relief Affairs in Northern and Southern Anhui</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Association and the Flood Relief Associations of various provinces jointly recommended Mr. Liu Lingsheng to be in charge of relief affairs in northern Anhui. He had previously gone to northern Anhui with relief friends to investigate the office. The office is now located in the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce. Now, Director Liu reported that the Huai River in northern Anhui is a disaster that occurs every few years. After investigating the cause, it is actually because the Hong Lake is silted up and the canal is tight, and the downstream cannot be unblocked. If the Wo, Ying, Fei, and Sui rivers are all silted up over the years, and once there is continuous rain, the disaster will appear immediately. This year, there was more than a month of heavy rain, and the Jiao River burst, and the rivers rose together. People fled in a hurry, and the strong climbed on the roofs, and the old and young drifted and disappeared with the current, which cannot be counted. Fields and seedlings are just the rest. None of the 21 counties in northern Anhui is without disaster. Judging from the current situation, the most serious are Wuhe, Fengyang, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Shouzhou, Yingshang, Huoqiu, and Bi, followed by Si, Xu, Su, Hao, Tai, Meng, Wo, Chu, Lai, Tian, ​​and Ding counties. It is appropriate to rush to release the current urgent relief, and the winter relief is even more critical. Now, climbing on the roof has become a thing of the past. People are displaced outside, and when the water recedes, they have no food or clothing, and they sleep in the open air, crying with hunger and cold. The situation is even more unbearable. The relief funds of the two associations are limited, and they are trying their best to raise funds. It depends on how the future income is before a plan can be made to expand. At present, only Wuhe, Fengyang, and other counties that have been severely affected are selected to provide urgent relief. Disaster counties where the water has gradually receded may release miscellaneous grains for sowing or release rape for sowing in order to have some harvest and provide invisible relief. If there is no overall plan and the two sides proceed, only urgent relief will be provided, and even tens of thousands of yuan will be difficult to help. We beg the two associations to consider and guide the implementation. After investigation, Director Liu Lingsheng went to northern Anhui with relief funds and medicines, and the flour transported there can be used to help one after another. Currently, he is investigating Wuhe, Fengyang, and other extremely severely affected areas to save lives. Recently, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Wuhu, Xuancheng, Nanling, Fanchang, and Dangtu counties in southern Anhui have been hit by sudden floods. Some city streets have been flooded and are in a state of disrepair. According to Mr. Xu Jiyu, a local elder in Nanling, the counties have seen corpses floating down, mostly couples holding hands and daughters holding each other, drifting down and being buried nowhere. Alas, it is tragic. Mr. Zhai Zhancheng, the director of the relief office of the two associations in southern Anhui, has previously gone with relief friends, carrying relief funds and medicines, and transporting relief flour. He is currently making arrangements. He will announce it after the detailed report arrives in Shanghai.</p>

(2) The board of directors shall be responsible for the implementation of all cooperative affairs. (3) The supervisory committee shall be responsible for the audit and supervision of cooperative affairs.

<p>Jiangxi Relief Worker Reports on Relief Methods</p>
<p>Zhou Baipeng of the Emergency Relief Association of Jiangxi reported on the disaster area work: "Respectfully, I was entrusted by the association to release emergency relief. I selected Jiujiang and Xinjian counties, each with 10,000 yuan in relief funds, 2 yuan for large households, 1 yuan for small households, and 12,000 relief tickets. I have reported this in a separate telegram. After two days of investigation, the most severely affected areas, such as the 9th, 8th, and 7th districts, have all been submerged. It is impossible to seek general relief. I plan to issue a notice with six regulations attached. Urgent relief in the event of a flood is the most difficult to handle, and investigation is even more difficult, so we have to handle it flexibly. Yesterday, I gathered the county magistrate and various legal entities to hold a meeting to discuss the distribution of relief funds, totaling 6,300 yuan for the 9th district and 3,200 yuan each for the 8th and 7th districts. It was also agreed that each disabled and bedridden person would receive 2 yuan, and the rest would receive 1 yuan. Twelve investigators were appointed to investigate and release funds at the same time. They took office today and will go to the 9th district with the county magistrate and the leaders of various legal entities tomorrow. It is expected that the emergency relief in the two counties will not be completed in 20 days. If the funds are released to other counties, please have the legal entities from the provincial capital go to handle them separately. Also, there are not enough relief tickets, please send more."</p>
<p>Hospital Ship for Disaster Relief Departs for Hankou: The "Zi Lin News" reports that the hospital ship organized by foreigners in this port for disaster relief in Hankou has been prepared and will depart for the disaster area in Wuhan at 5:00 pm on Sunday. The ship has been renovated from head to tail. The cargo hold and lower deck have been painted white and equipped with glass windows and converted into wards that can accommodate 150 patients. In front of the middle cabin is a surgical and pharmacy room, and in the rear deck are the medical director's office and the nurses' room. All the layouts are quite complete, and a large amount of disinfectant, food, and medicinal materials are carried for use in Hankou.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Industry Union Donates to Disaster Relief: This time, it raised 648.6 yuan in silver dollars, 1,600 dimes, and 51 copper coins for flood relief. On the 16th, Zhao Xinghui and Fang Qingjian sent them to the Municipal Party Department for forwarding to the disaster relief agency for release.</p>
<p>Suggestion to Use Mid-Autumn Feast Funds to Help Disaster Relief: The Shanghai Charity Organization Federation sent a letter to various charity organizations: "With respect, although the disaster relief funds for the floods in various provinces this year have been enthusiastically donated by people from all walks of life, the area is wide and the disaster is severe, and it is still a drop in the bucket. We have to raise funds through various channels. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, factories, companies, and shops are using the funds for feasts to help disaster relief. The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Disaster Relief in Various Provinces has also published advertisements to solicit donations. Our charity organizations are eager to do good deeds, and we should all agree to move one night's feast to the needs of disaster victims' lives. The merit is boundless. Please submit all the funds transferred to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Disaster Relief in Various Provinces in Renji Hall for verification. This letter is sent to you for your information and handling. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<p>The Work of the Ciyou Association to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Children: The Zhonghua Ciyou Xieji Association has been soliciting donations of clothing and bedding from the National Government Flood Relief Committee and the office of the Shanghai Disaster Victims Reception Center for days to work together.

<p>Local News: Counterfeit Money Case Discovered in Sichuan</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Counterfeit Money Case</h3>
<p>The Litigation of Zhonghe Bank's Banknotes</p>
<p>Involves Lu Fengzhu and Xi Yuquan</p>
<p>Lu Fengzhu, the manager of the Zhonghua Printing House, guaranteed the former Da Zhonghua Printing Company to print banknotes for the Zhonghe Bank in Chongqing, Sichuan in 1928. Recently, the bank discovered banknotes with duplicate numbers on the market. After careful investigation, it was found that Wang Hongbin, Xi Yuquan, and others were involved in the case. Wang Hongbin was detained by the Sichuan Military Department, who confessed that the manager of the Shanghai Zhonghua Printing House was suspected. Therefore, the representative Zeng Binghui filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, which was tried by Judge Feng Shide in the First Criminal Court. First, Lu Fengzhu claimed that the Zhonghe Bank's banknotes were printed by the Da Zhonghua Printing Company. At that time, because he and the chairman of the company, Yang Gao, were cousins, he asked him to guarantee the printing of banknotes for Zhonghe, so he did act as a guarantor. As for the counterfeit banknotes, he knew nothing about it. The judge asked why he wanted to be a guarantor. Lu said it was a common practice in the business world, and a guarantor was required for signing a contract. However, after assuming the responsibility of a guarantor, he did not know any other procedures because he had his own factory and was busy with business. As for the delivery procedures, according to common practice, the first sample was sent to the Zhonghe representative for inspection. Only after being satisfied could it be printed. However, the production of this type of plate took about a year. On July 12, 1928, I learned that this type of banknote had been printed and all the original plates were returned to the Zhonghe representative with a receipt as proof. After the two parties completed the procedures at that time, the contract should have been canceled. However, because the Zhonghe representative Tang Bingzhang went abroad, I wanted to cancel it, but it was not implemented. Now many banknotes with duplicate Zhonghe numbers have been found, which must not have been printed in Shanghai because the printing plates for this type of banknote can be printed everywhere. The judge asked again whether he knew about Wang Hongbin and Xi Yuquan's joint counterfeiting and use of banknotes, and whether he had met them. He replied that around June, a friend said that Wang Hongbin had done this. Xi Yuquan was the son of Xi Yanggao and was his cousin. After Xi Yanggao died, Da Zhonghua went bankrupt, and I sued Da Zhonghua in your court because of this. After the matter was resolved, Yuquan went to Sichuan. When he returned to Shanghai from Sichuan, I met him once. Now I don't know whether the people involved in the case, such as Wang Zhi'an and Xi Yuquan, are in Shanghai. Next, the plaintiff Zeng Binghui said that after failing to detain Xi Yuquan and Wang Zhi'an last time, he investigated everywhere and learned that Xi Yuquan was now in the Hongkou area of ​​Shanghai. According to Lu Fengzhu, since they were cousins, he should know his address. Wang Zhi'an originally lived at No. 100 Jing'an Temple Road, but when I went to inquire, he said that he had moved in May of the solar calendar. I also went to investigate at No. 19 Taishun Lane, Xiafei Road, but he also claimed not to know. However, according to Article 6 of the contract at the time of printing, if counterfeit banknotes are found in the future, the guarantor shall be responsible for all losses. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer asked the defendant, Lu Fengzhu, whether the money for the goods had been delivered when he was a guarantor. Lu replied that he did not handle the money except as a guarantor. However, when the two parties delivered the price of the goods, he signed a word next to the order as proof. He was also asked whether the printing fee had been paid. He replied that he thought it had been paid when the plates were delivered, but he did not know exactly how much. However, the freight had not been paid, and it should have been paid within 1928. He was also asked whether he had received money between 1929 and 1931. He replied that he could not recall. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer took out a check for 1,000 yuan sent to Lu from Sichuan and presented it to the court. The defendant's lawyer immediately claimed that the 1,000 yuan was the share money that Wang Hongbin asked Lu Fengzhu to join Wufeng Company. Because Wufeng Company disappeared invisibly, the share money was returned. He also said that this case was discovered in Sichuan that Wang Hongbin was suspected of counterfeiting banknotes, and Lu Fengzhu was implicated in the confession in the interrogation by the military department. However, his confession was just a photographic copy and not the original, so he requested to see the file. Judge Feng announced that he would send a letter to the Baxian Local Court for a reply and reschedule the trial. Lu Fengzhu was temporarily released on bail by his lawyer.</p>
<p>Fire in Ximen Road</p>
<h3>An Apprentice Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Cause of the Fire Unknown</p>
<p>The Xingyuanchang Fried Goods, Tea, and Confectionery Store at No. 16 Ximen Road in the French Concession is opened by a Ningbo woman, Zhu Lu. Her husband has passed away, and she lives upstairs. The store is managed by hired people. Recently, it is the time of the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, and mooncakes are on the market. The store's director is rushing to make mooncakes to meet the market demand. At 1:30 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the back room upstairs in the store. The fire was fierce and immediately burst through the roof. The fire brigade was notified and rushed to put out the fire before it was extinguished. The store has already been burned down. When the fire broke out, the shop assistants and the director upstairs and downstairs, and the hostess Zhu Lu, were all asleep. They heard the alarm and ran out immediately, but only the apprentice Zhang Jiliang, 15 years old, from Shaoxing, entered the store in March last year, because he did not have time to escape, he was burned by the flames on his chest, back, and hands. He was rescued by the fire brigade and sent to Renji Police Hospital for treatment. However, due to the attack of fire poison, the treatment was ineffective. He died in the hospital at 8:45 am. The hospital notified the police station, and detectives took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy, waiting for the court to inspect it today. It is reported that the store has a large number of fire insurance policies, and the police are ordering detectives to investigate the fire in detail. One side took the firestarter Zhu Lu into the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Merchants and Residents Request to Take Over Wanfu Convent</h3>
<p>Rush to Build Various Mud Roads</p>
<p>Several dozen merchants and residents in Zhabei, including Yang Dexing, Yang Shunxing, Jitai Rice Store, Huacheng Department Store, Dehai Porcelain Store, Changchuntang Pharmacy, and Tianxiang Silver Store, sent a public letter to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works yesterday, saying: "With respect, after investigating a corner of Zhabei, factories have sprung up in recent years, and the market is booming. Although it can be said that the trend of the situation is such, the improvement of municipal facilities has also contributed to this. The roads in Zhabei that directly connect to the concessions are first and foremost North Sichuan Road, and secondly, Datong Road. The reason why Datong Road cannot compare to North Sichuan Road is that the railway at the Sun Temple and the Wanfu Nunnery are obstructing it. We have heard that the nuns in Wanfu Nunnery are divided due to property disputes, and the nunnery is now unattended. If your bureau can take over the nunnery at this time and connect the newly planned entrance to Tonglu Road, it will directly reach the Yuhuang Palace in Pengpu Town, and pedestrians north of the town will inevitably regard this route as a shortcut, and the market can be expected to prosper. If the new Datong Road passes through remote areas, it may be possible to build a mud road first, and the residents along the road will come without being expected. Other roads, such as Tiantong Nunnery and Zhonghua Xin Road, will all be important roads after the establishment of the Xinshui Municipal Government, and the mud roads should be built first. The market will change drastically. We hereby respectfully send a letter to inform you that we beg your Excellency to take over the Wanfu Nunnery and build the mud road for the new Datong Road first, and also build the mud road for Tiantong Nunnery Road and Zhonghua Xin Road. We are deeply grateful."</p>

<p>The Court Detains and Questions the Corpse's Relatives</p>
<p>Ling Xiangxiang, the sedan chair carrier of Xia Yingtang, a famous doctor, was killed and his body was burned. This case has been vigorously investigated by the local court in accordance with the principle of prosecution ex officio by the prosecutor. However, Ling Zhaozhao, the corpse's brother, and Ling Fuwei, the corpse's son, have been repeatedly ordered to appear in court, but they have failed to do so, which has hindered the investigation. Therefore, the police were dispatched yesterday to detain the two people for questioning. After questioning, they were ordered to be released and await the arrival of the arrested criminals for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Child Abduction Case is Postponed for Retrial</h3>
<p>Four-Year-Old Ningbo Child of Unknown Name</p>
<p>The Two Women are Remanded in Custody to Await Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Si Gen, a four-year-old boy from Wuxi, who lived at No. 906 Tao Peng Road, was abducted without a trace while playing in front of his door at 8:30 am on the 12th of this month. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station learned that the abductor was funded by the Ningbo child Zhu Ating (only 11 years old) as the leader. They detained and interrogated him at the First District Court. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Later, the abductors, Fu Faqing from Ningbo and Wu Zhaoyan, a 14-year-old bad boy, were also arrested. After questioning, they were ordered to be detained. It was learned that there were also Fujian woman Lin Wang and Cantonese woman Li Chen, who bought children, hiding at No. 20 Jixiang Lane, Gaochang Temple Railway Road, Huajie. The Chinese detective Liu Baoshan, detective Cao Suorong, and detective Xie Futang, who were responsible for handling the case, went there secretly the day before yesterday, arrested the two women at the address, found a Ningbo child of four years old, and took them back to the police station for detention. The case was brought to the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. According to the lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station, Lin Wang admitted at the police station that she bought the Ningbo child for 25 yuan from overseas, and another child has been sent back to his hometown. The four-year-old Ningbo child who was found did not know his name. Therefore, it was requested that the case be postponed for joint interrogation with the three defendants, Zhu Ating and others. The detectives then reported the situation of the arrest of the two women. When the young child was interrogated, he only knew that he was four years old, and he did not hear or answer anything else, but only nodded his head frequently. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered the two women to be remanded in custody and wait for Judge Xiao to interrogate them in court. The nameless child was sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.</p>

<h3>New Contribution of Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>Baixianqiao Branch Installs Night Safe</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Baixianqiao Branch of Shanghai Bank, its business has been exceptionally prosperous due to its well-known credibility and attentive service. Recently, it has been heard that the bank, adhering to the principle of serving society and seeking convenience for depositors, has spared no expense to install a secure night safe. According to reports, many large banks in Europe and America have installed such safes. Because bank operations have fixed hours, and during holidays or after office hours, if individuals or businesses have silver dollar income at night, they cannot deposit it in the bank and must store it at home or in the business, facing the danger of robbery and theft. Since the invention of the night safe, this problem has been solved easily. The safe is installed at the entrance of the bank, much like a mailbox, and depositors can rent a box. No matter the time, renters can deposit their money into the safe, and the next morning, they can come to the bank to withdraw it and handle the account according to ordinary deposit procedures. It is said that the rental procedure is very simple and free of charge. The bank has printed brochures, available upon request.</p>
<h3>Small Steamer Collides with Sampan Boat</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was the Sole Son of Xin Genbao's Three Households</p>
<p>At 7 PM last night, the Yuan, a small steamer operated by Li Caifu, departed from the Bund Wharf on Guangdong Road and sailed south. While passing near Buoy No. 1 of the Taikoo Wharf, a Ningbo sampan, No. 479, carrying a passenger, rowed over from Pudong and came within inches of the steamer. Unable to avoid it in time, the bow of the steamer violently struck the middle of the sampan's right side. The passenger in the sampan, Chen Rongyan, was quick-witted and agile, and in an instant, he jumped onto the steamer, fortunately escaping unharmed. However, the sampan capsized instantly, and the sampan operator, Xin Genbao, fell into the Huangpu River and sank to the bottom, tragically drowning. Thereupon, Zhang Jinlong, the second-in-charge of the steamer, along with the sampan passenger, Chen Rongyan, took the matter to the Maritime Customs Police Station to report the cause and circumstances. Chen testified as to the circumstances of the collision. The police chief ordered Zhang to be detained. Meanwhile, detective Shen Changshan was dispatched to the home of the deceased at No. 3 Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong to notify the family. Xin Jiuren, the deceased's uncle, came forward and stated that the deceased was the sole son of three households, a 24-year-old Ningbo native, married for ten months, leaving behind a daughter, born only twenty days ago. He requested that the defendant compensate for the deceased's coffin expenses and the future living expenses of his wife and daughter. The steamer side expressed its willingness to resolve the matter peacefully.</p>

Around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, Li Lüshi and Chen Xieshi happened to pass by the corner of Pingliang Road and Taopeng Road when they saw the two bandits walking slowly on the road. The two women recognized them without a doubt and reported them to the nearby stationed Chinese constables No. 2935 and No. 2115, who arrested Chen Youcai and Chen Xiaoerzi together and took them to Huishan Police Station. The police chief ordered them to be detained. The next morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District.

<h3>Inquiry from Mr. So-and-so</h3>
<p>I am nineteen years old this year. I studied lacemaking in Shanghai for over two years when I was fifteen, but the shop closed due to losses, and I had to go home. Later, I was fortunate enough to be recommended by a relative to a soy sauce shop, but I still have to follow the old apprenticeship system for three years. This has given me a sense of shame. I can't abandon it and go back, nor do I have the strength to seek other employment. When I think back, I am afraid that others will say that I am too fickle. So I keep this matter bottled up in my heart. Please help me resolve it.</p>
<p>(Reply) Although you studied lacemaking for two years, you have now switched to the soy sauce industry, and the nature of the business is very different. As the saying goes, "Every trade is a mountain." You are inevitably unfamiliar with everything and must start as an apprentice. "To climb high, start from below; to travel far, start from nearby." This is indeed the proper and necessary path. What is there to be ashamed of? Look at those who do not consider their virtue or abilities and are arrogant and self-important—they are the ones who are truly ashamed. I advise you not to keep this "bottled up in your heart." You should strive forward quickly.</p>
<h3>Inquiry from Mr. So-and-so</h3>
<p>My late father was ill for a long time, and the family estate was ruined, leading to his death. Later, I grew up and studied at a business school. Time flies, and four years have passed. I am ashamed of my mediocre talent and have nothing of merit to offer. However, my income is meager, barely enough to make ends meet. The most difficult thing to resolve is the marriage issue. The economic hardship is a factor, and I am still hesitating. However, urban women tend to have extravagant habits, and their desire for vanity is high. Without sufficient money, it is difficult to support their spending. As for women from rural areas, they are often stubborn and inflexible, and their parents have outdated ideas. Without wealth and property, I am afraid it will be difficult to deal with them. These are the most pressing issues for me. Please provide guidance urgently.</p>
<p>(Reply) You find that urban women are too vain and extravagant, while you dislike rural women for being stubborn and outdated, leaving you unable to choose a partner. In fact, "Within ten steps, there will surely be fragrant grass." In the city, there is no shortage of diligent and thrifty women. In the countryside, there are enlightened and virtuous women. You should entrust relatives and friends to search in many ways. In the future, you will not find it difficult to meet someone suitable and satisfactory. If you are concerned about economic hardship, then arranging a marriage in the countryside will be simpler and more economical than in the city. What do you think?</p>

<p>Gate North Levy on Rickshaws</p>
<h3>Chaos Arises in Disaster Relief Donation</h3>
<p>Bad Elements Disrupting From Within</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Detains the Ringleaders</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM yesterday, at Datong Road, Zhongxing Road, Taiyang Temple, Dayang Bridge, Hengfeng Road, and Xinmin Road in Gate North, groups of three to five rickshaw pullers spread rumors, coercing other rickshaw pullers to join the strike and arbitrarily releasing air from the rickshaw tires, causing all kinds of disturbances. The rickshaw pullers, unable to work, dragged their rickshaws back to the company one after another. After hearing the news, the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District immediately dispatched police officers to detain the troublemakers for questioning. After investigating the truth, it was found that bad elements were taking advantage of the situation to create chaos for their own benefit. It is said that the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association, in view of the severity of the floods in various provinces, had imposed a donation of 30 cents of small silver dollars on each rickshaw in the Gate North area to be collected and sent for relief. Some who rented out rickshaws spread rumors, claiming that the rickshaw tax was being increased and that 20 copper coins were being collected from the rickshaw pullers every day for their own pockets. The Public Security Bureau, upon learning of this situation, immediately detained the ringleaders, including Chou Guizhi and several others, for questioning in order to deter others from following suit.</p>

<p>The construction of road surfaces, bridges, culverts, and other projects on Songhu County Road has been completed on both the Shanghai and Songjiang sides.

Now, Sun Shengzeng, the director of both the Songjiang and Shanghai Construction Bureaus, believes that with the entire road nearing completion, the construction of the Huibiao Bridge cannot be delayed. He has already drafted the bridge's design, budget, and detailed construction rules and submitted them to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction. Construction will begin as soon as the instructions are approved, in order to facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>Second District of Shanghai County Opposes Increased Land Price</h3>
<p>Explains Seven Reasons</p>
<p>Peng Zhaotang, the head of the Second District of Shanghai County, submitted a document to the county government yesterday opposing the increase in land prices. The document stated that during the district affairs meeting held on September 10th, the township heads proposed that the current reevaluation of land prices by the county government, which averaged 115 yuan per mu, did not reflect the actual situation and increased the burden on the people. They requested that the original price be maintained. The township heads unanimously argued against recognizing the revised land prices, citing several reasons: (1) The land declaration method established by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen allowed landowners to declare their own prices, and the state would levy taxes based on those prices. The current land price evaluation method is inconsistent with the one set by the Premier. Furthermore, the land price evaluation meeting was attended only by representatives of various agencies and district heads, with no opportunity for taxpayers to express their views, which is inconsistent with the principle of people's rights. The representatives of various agencies and district heads only considered increasing revenue, disregarding the facts and the suffering of the people. This is difficult to accept. (2) The county government's justification for increasing land prices is the lack of construction funds. However, the essential principle of the National Reconstruction Outline established by the Premier is "the priority of construction lies in the people's livelihood." Does the current so-called construction have a direct impact on the people's livelihood, or is it merely the construction of government buildings and unnecessary embellishments? If projects such as dredging rivers and canals directly benefit the people's livelihood, then even if a special levy is imposed in addition to the 1% land tax, the people would gladly comply. For example, this year's dredging of the Yu Tang River involved not only land levies but also labor contributions for the dredging, and the people did not complain. It is unnecessary to quibble over land prices. As for construction projects that are not practical needs, the higher authorities have already issued clear orders to postpone them in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and consider their capabilities. Now, the county government is using the name of construction to forcibly increase the burden on the people. This is difficult to accept. (3) The county government claims that land prices in neighboring counties are higher than the original land prices in this county. However, Baoshan and Chuansha are relatively far from this district, and the details are unknown. If we consider Songjiang, most of the fields in Songjiang County are used to grow rice, and their productivity is higher than that of this county. It is acceptable for their land prices to be slightly increased. However, most of the land in this district is used to grow cotton and is close to the Huangpu River, making the soil less fertile. The harvest is generally less than that of Songjiang, and the land prices should be lower. However, the newly reevaluated land prices are even 5 yuan higher than those of Songjiang. How can this be considered fair? As for the gradual increase in land prices along the banks of the Huangpu River near the urban area, this is only the case in a very small number of places and cannot be used as a reason to increase land prices throughout the county. This is difficult to accept. (4) The central government has long issued orders regarding the funding of the Kuomintang, stating that it should be self-sufficient through party dues paid by party members and income taxes. It is even more inappropriate to reevaluate land prices and increase the burden on the people for this reason. This is difficult to accept. (5) Land transactions in this district have already been conducted with official deeds issued, and taxes have been paid to the Finance Bureau. The prices are clearly stated on the deeds, with a maximum of 100 yuan per mu. The Finance Bureau's deed tax office has factual evidence to verify this, and there is no need for empty arguments. The current arbitrary increase of 15 yuan per mu is clearly contrary to the facts. This is difficult to accept. (6) This year, there have been successive disasters of heavy rains and typhoons, causing great damage to agricultural production. Farmers cannot maintain their livelihoods, and many are selling their assets. Land prices will inevitably fall, but now the assessment is being increased. This is difficult to accept. (7) If it is said that the land prices are only being reevaluated now, and the increased taxes will be implemented in the future, then it would not be too late to reevaluate the land prices when they actually increase in the future and the people's financial capacity is slightly improved. Why is this unrealistic assessment being conducted now? This is difficult to accept. (8) Based on these reasons, although the district head has tried his best to persuade them, the township heads have insisted on pleading for the people and said that it is their duty to do so. They unanimously resolved to petition the county government to maintain the original prices. The district head did not dare to withhold this information and is submitting this document for your approval to maintain the original prices in order to conform to public opinion, which would be in the best interest of the public.</p>

<p>Preparation</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Anti-Japanese Leaders in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Lin Youwang, Shen Zhuowu, Zhang Zilian, Huang Jingwan, Liu Shimu, Shi Huanzhang, Zhang Xiqi, and more than thirty others. A preparatory meeting for a memorial service for Mr. Jiang Weishui, the guiding light of the Taiwanese revolution, was held at the Datong Hotel yesterday. Mr. Zhuang Xiquan was first elected to report on the progress of the preparations and the spirit of Mr. Jiang's lifelong struggle. He also received support from various Asian nationalities. The public advocated expanding propaganda to awaken the people of the country from their delusions. Responsible persons were immediately appointed to proceed with the work separately. It was decided to hold a meeting at the Penglai Market on October 4th to formulate the order of proceedings, and the Public Security Bureau was requested to send police officers to provide protection. Yang Mengchu, the leader of the overseas Chinese revolution in the Philippines, will give a speech on Mr. Jiang's lifelong career, taking it upon himself to alleviate the suffering of mankind and resist power. He presided over the Taiwan People's Party, organized the Cultural Association, discussed autonomy, researched academics, and lectured everywhere. He established the Workers' and Farmers' League for economic and political struggle training. Although he encountered oppression, prohibitions, closures, and dissolutions from the Japanese government, Mr. Jiang continued his relentless struggle with an indomitable spirit. His courageous spirit is truly enough to intimidate the enemy and seize their morale. It is hoped that the youth of China will rise up to complete Mr. Jiang's unfinished will.</p>

<h3>Eating One's Husband Alive (Part 2)</h3>
<p>I harbored a curiousity, wanting to see how a newly fertilized female mantis would treat a second husband introduced to her. The results of the investigation are alarming. The female mantis is never satisfied with her desires for food and sex. Regardless of whether she lays eggs or not, she rests for a while, the duration varies, and is able to receive a second husband and eat him just like the first one. The third one comes up, fulfills his duty in life, is eaten, and disappears without a trace. The fate of the fourth one is the same. Within two weeks, I personally witnessed the same female mantis eat seven male mantises. She welcomed them into her embrace, demanding that everyone pay the price of love with their lives.</p>
<p>"People always think that the male can freely escape in nature, but that's not true. I personally saw a pair of mates engaging in this terrifying act there. The male, with all his energy devoted to fulfilling his natural duty, held the female tightly. But he no longer had a head, not even a neck, and his body was not complete. The female, with her mouth stretched over his neck, was eating her unfinished tender lover there..."</p>
<p>We have a friend whose wife is very fierce. He doesn't dare to say anything in front of her, and often calls her a tigress behind her back. I advised him to be philosophical and told him about the family life of the mantis. He said, "I really am better than some, but not as good as others."</p>
<p>If you don't believe Fabre's words, you can raise some mantises and try it out. Why should you believe his words? It's best to try it out yourself.</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Experts in Making False Eyes. There is a strange profession in England: specializing in making false eyes. This false eye shop is located on New Oxford Street in London. New Oxford Street has been in business for 150 years, passed down from generation to generation. The current manager is the great-grandson of the original founder.</p>
<p>The false eyes made in this shop are extremely realistic and natural. They look lifelike, as if they were real. They cannot be distinguished from real eyes in photographs. Because the fine veins on the eyes are also reproduced one by one, and the pupils can be enlarged and reduced. Such technology is truly ingenious.</p>
<p>Recently, they have received several special orders. It turns out that several theocratic countries in Africa and the East have ordered false eyes to be embedded in their worshipped idols, making them appear more radiant. Those martial gods need a pair of sharp and fierce eyes, while compassionate gods need a pair of gentle and amiable eyes. They can do them all perfectly.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zhixin: A Man of Perseverance and Determination</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Zhu Zhixin, originally named Da Fu, was from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. His ancestors lived in Yue, and he became a resident of Panyu. He was the most enthusiastic practitioner in the revolutionary movement. He received a traditional education from a young age, and was well-versed in poetry, lyrics, prose, and rhyming prose. As a young man, he studied in Japan and excelled in English and Japanese literature. At that time, Premier Sun was in Japan organizing the Tongmenghui. Because of his kinship with Wang Jingwei, they joined the alliance together and worked hard for the revolutionary movement. During the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Zhu arrived at the last minute, tore off the lower half of his long gown to make it a short jacket, received a pistol, and attacked the governor's office with his comrades. The uprising failed, and he was wounded and fled to Hong Kong. He then risked his life to enter Xiangshan and led the militia to launch an uprising to intimidate the thieves' hearts.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic, Zhu devoted himself to the political construction of Guangdong Province and served as the Pacification Commander, which brought peace to the region. During the Second Revolution of the Guichou year, Zhu participated in the battle to slay the dragon and supported Premier Sun in organizing the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In the sixth year of the Republic, he returned to Guangdong with Premier Sun and devoted himself to political and military affairs. He later returned to Shanghai to edit the Construction Magazine. Later, when Premier Sun launched the Northern Expedition and led his troops into Guangxi, Zhu also followed. He was then assassinated by the enemy in Humen and martyred on September 21st of the ninth year of the Republic. He was only thirty-six years old.</p>
<p>Zhu's life was one of perseverance and determination. He was righteous and unyielding, and his personality was straightforward and hated evil like an enemy. He was respected and feared by his comrades in the party. He was always unkempt and had long fingernails. When comrades advised him to cut them, he would glare at them. One day, Premier Sun saw that his fingernails were very dirty and picked up scissors and said to Zhu, "Zhixin, it is not elegant to have such long fingernails. Are you too busy writing to cut them? I will cut them for you." Zhu bowed his head in obedience and dared not resist. Also, when Zhu was in Tokyo, most of his comrades had cut their queues and changed their clothes, but Zhu was the only one who did the opposite. Those who did not know the reason suspected that he had other motives. Some of the more radical even said that he was a traitor. However, Zhu had other motives. Returning to the country with his queue cut and his clothes changed to engage in revolution would attract attention and make his actions inconvenient, so he kept it. At that time, he once said to those who opposed it, "How can sparrows know the ambitions of swans? Real revolution has nothing to do with pigtails. A great man must be concerned with the important things. Those who are short-sighted are concerned with trivial matters. I do not approve of that." From his words, we can know what kind of person Zhu was.</p>
<p>After Zhu's death, his comrades compiled the Zhu Zhixin Collection. Among them, the article "What is Jesus?" has been regarded as a propaganda template by the anti-Christian movement in recent years. The Zhixin School in Guangzhou was established in memory of Zhu and has achieved great success.</p>
<h3>Fang Ganshi: One Who Saved Hankou from the Flood</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>This year, the Yangtze and Han Rivers flooded, and the water level was the highest since records began at the Customs. Some say that with such a powerful force of water rushing in, it was beyond human power to resist. The dikes and embankments should have broken and collapsed, and the three towns of Wuhan should have been submerged one after another. More than a dozen counties in eastern Hubei became swamps, almost restoring the old state of Yunmeng. According to a letter from a friend in Hankou, Zongguan in the Qiaokou District in the northwest corner of Hankou borders the Xiang River, and the terrain is known to be low-lying. The Shanghai Maofu Shen Sanxin Corporation separately established the Shenxin No. 4 Factory and the Fuxin No. 5 Factory here. In the autumn of the 15th year of the Republic of China, Wuhan suffered a major flood. The two factories were newly established and unfamiliar with the terrain, so they were the first to be submerged. They then built factory dikes to protect themselves. This year, Mr. Li Guowei, the manager of the two factories, foresaw that there would be a major flood due to the heavy snow at the end of the year and the continuous rain in the middle of the year. In July, he gathered the nearby people to engage in prevention. The factory subsidized the funds, and the defense line was more than 20 li long. After July 27, the Xiang River flooded, and they were spared from the disaster. At that time, the water level was already five inches higher than the highest record in the first year of the Guangxu reign. The general mentality was that the water level had reached its peak, and there was a sense of complacency. Mr. Li alone realized that the dam was in danger and that the factory dike was not high enough. He urgently raised and widened the original factory dike and the temporary earth mounds built in the Zongguan market street, connecting them to form a line, encompassing the entire Zongguan city with a circumference of more than 4 li, and raised them from time to time according to the outside water level. The top of the dike was almost level with the eaves of the houses. On August 5, the river water surged down, and the Yangtze and Han Rivers rose sharply. By the 19th, it reached its highest point, 3.6 inches higher than the previous highest record. The Huangjingtang dike then collapsed, and the Zhanggong dike was also flooded. The Xiang River rushed and flowed horizontally, overflowing everywhere. Only Zongguan was spared from being submerged because it was protected by the new dike. However, the new dike leaked water from then on, and there was a risk of collapse at any time, which was extremely dangerous. Mr. Li supervised the colleagues and workers in the factory day and night, neglecting food and sleep, and worked together to rescue it. When they could not get enough soil, they used waste flower wheat flour to block it. In this way, the dangerous period of more than 20 days passed, and they were unharmed. At this time, the entire town of Hankou was submerged, but only this place was able to maintain a dry area of one square mile. People gathered to avoid disaster and to catch the market, regarding it as a blessed land. The two factories are still operating as usual. Even the unemployed workers nearby were able to make a living with the wages they earned from building the dike.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk from the Leisure Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Qian Nengxun and Zhou Shumo</p>
<p>Qian Nengxun, also known as Qian Gancheng, was a native of Jiashan, Zhejiang. Zhou Shumo, also known as Zhou Shaopu, was a native of Tianmen, Hubei. Qian Nengxun was a Jinshi graduate of the Bingxu year, and Zhou Shumo was a Jinshi graduate of the Yichou year. Both were successively appointed as editors and then as censors. Both men had large faces and large ears. Zhou Shumo's appearance was especially plump and he had what was considered the "eyes of a high official." He was appreciated by Xu Juren (Xu Shichang). When the Liaodong New Province was established during the late Qing Dynasty, Xu Shichang was appointed as Governor-General by imperial decree. He established two offices, the Chengxuan and Ziyi Halls, within his office. He recommended Zhou Shumo as the Left Advisor, concurrently leading the Chengxuan Hall, and Qian Nengxun as the Right Advisor, concurrently leading the Ziyi Hall. All matters were discussed and consulted before implementation. They were considered his right and left hands. After Xu Shichang was transferred to the Ministry of Posts and Communications, Zhou Shumo was promoted to Governor of Heilongjiang. The vacated position of Left Advisor was filled by Liang Ruhao, recommended by Tang Shaochuan, the Governor of Fengtian. Liang was lazy and did not manage affairs, so Qian Nengxun controlled all the power. His colleagues were displeased. When Xu Shichang was about to go to Beijing, he said to Qian Nengxun, "I am leaving. Qingbi is an old friend. You should serve him well." Qingbi was the courtesy name of Xiliang, who succeeded Xu Shichang. Xiliang had only just taken office when he saw that Qian Nengxun was monopolizing power. He intended to punish him slightly but hesitated. A staff member said, "Donghai is currently very close to him and cannot be easily offended. Why not submit a request to abolish the position, avoiding the appearance of pushing him out and achieving the effect of avoiding blame?" Xiliang nodded and followed this plan. An imperial decree approved it. When Xu Shichang heard about it, he was displeased, saying, "My fellow Jinshi, Qian Gancheng, has made contributions to the new policies in Liaodong. Qingbi cannot tolerate him. If he truly had bad deeds, dismissing him would be acceptable, but abolishing the position is truly embarrassing for me. I am still in office, and officials in the frontier are like this, disregarding right and wrong and contributions and faults. How can governance still be asked about?" At that time, the position of Vice Minister of Shuntian Prefecture was vacant. Xu Shichang strongly recommended Qian Nengxun's talents to Yikuang, who then recommended him to the court. He was appointed as the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Shaanxi. Soon after taking office, he protected the Governor. During the Xinhai Revolution, Qian Nengxun tried to kill himself with a knife but was rescued. He changed clothes and went to Beijing. Some say that Qian Nengxun entered the capital after his position was abolished but was not summoned. Xu Shichang re-entered the Grand Secretariat and lobbied for a long time before he was appointed as the Shaanxi Provincial Treasurer. It is also said that his elder brother, Mingxun, held the position of Tianjin Customs Superintendent during the Xinhai Revolution. This is not true. Mingxun was transferred from a position in a ministry to the position of Tianjin Customs Superintendent and died in office in the Wushen year. He was replaced by Cai Shaoji, a Cantonese. During the turmoil of the Xinhai Revolution, Cai Shaoji claimed illness and resigned. Chen Kuilong, the Governor-General of Zhili, ordered Shen Mingchang, a candidate official staff member, to temporarily fill the position. This is the truth. When Yuan Shikai was in power, he abolished the State Council in the Jiaoyin year and established the Hall of Political Affairs, modeled after the Tang dynasty. He appointed Xu Shichang as Secretary of State and Yang Shiqi as Left Secretary. Initially, Liang Dunyan was the Right Secretary. Liang Dunyan was jointly recommended by Xu Shichang and Yang Shiqi to manage the Ministry of Communications. One day, Yuan Shikai said to Xu Shichang, "The positions of Left and Right Secretaries are those of prime ministers. Only those with deep experience and abundant talent can manage them. What does the Prime Minister think?" (Yuan Shikai called Xu Shichang Prime Minister, and the name of Prime Minister became widely known.) Xu Shichang understood his intention and replied, "Qian Nengxun is intelligent and capable and can handle difficult tasks." Yuan Shikai pondered for a long time and said, "Gancheng is currently in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Is it not skipping ranks to suddenly participate in the core of power?" Xu Shichang replied, "Then how about Shaopu?" Yuan Shikai said, "Shaopu is upright and just. A position as President of the Administrative Court is already being held for him." Gancheng is a fellow Jinshi with the Prime Minister (Xu Shichang was also a Jinshi graduate of the Bingxu year). Xingcheng is a relative through marriage. Just like the rise of the Two Han Dynasties and the simultaneous emergence of the Three Sus, although his qualifications are slightly inferior, it is appropriate to choose people for the task. I only thought of this now, and it was not yet mentioned." Xu Shichang retired and told Qian Nengxun, "The matter is settled. You have never worked with Yuan Shikai for a single day. Although the position of Right Secretary is honorable, it is not appropriate to overstep. Perhaps you can stay in your position for a long time. Do not neglect it." Qian Nengxun agreed. Zhou Shumo was initially informed that the position of Right Secretary was already decided internally. He revealed considerable resentment and issued orders. When he was appointed President of the Administrative Court, he suspected that Qian Nengxun had privately asked Xu Shichang to seize his position. He was very unhappy. Xu Shichang explained for a long time, and then he stopped resenting.</p>
<p>Maintaining it. Therefore, although refugees crowded the area, the residents lived in peace and daily necessities were not lacking. Compared to the people of the three towns who were struggling in the water, the difference in suffering and happiness was like heaven and earth. It is said that the cost of building the dikes at the two factories was about 40,000 taels of silver, but there was no loss of goods or machinery. The Wufeng Flour Mill in Hanyang had only one-fifth of the capital of the Fuxin Flour Mill but suffered losses of more than 100,000 yuan due to a lack of water precautions. Zongguan is the industrial area of Hankou, with dozens of factories and more than 20,000 residents. Without the protection of the new dike, the losses from flooding would have been incalculable. Now, Mr. Li has advocated building a dike and has been able to protect a corner of the area. It can truly be said that he has contributed to the local area. It is also said that a certain gentleman from the Yarn Mill Association, whose home is in Taixian, also anticipated that there would be major flooding this autumn and sent a letter to his family, urging them to build dikes early. Later, the floods spread, but the village where the gentleman lived was spared from being submerged. This can also be compared to the preservation of Zongguan, shining brightly from east to west, and can serve as a guide for those who manage water. Unfortunately, the person who told the story could not remember the gentleman's name and it was impossible to find out. It is expected that there will be more than just one or two such cases in this national flood. Because there are no commendations, many are not heard by the world. However, from this, it can also be seen that everything depends on human effort. If those in charge could have taken precautions, even if the flood was large, it would have been possible to protect a lot. Alas, bending chimneys and moving firewood are considered meddlesome, while being burned and injured are considered honored guests. The situation is the same from ancient times to the present. Thinking of this, how can one not sigh at the lack of foresight?</p>

<h3>A Husband's Wife (19)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>The starting and ending points of love are exactly like spider silk. There must be someone to stick to in order to connect, otherwise, it floats in the air with nothing to hold onto. There is no tension, no sustenance, and ultimately no use. Mrs. Li has lost her husband's love, and is just like floating silk. As long as she encounters someone she thinks can sustain love, she wants to stick to him. However, she often warns herself not to do anything that society considers dishonorable. On the one hand, she would disgrace herself, and on the other hand, she would embarrass Mr. Li, and at the same time, she would damage Mr. Chen's reputation. Her heart is more troubled than anyone else's. She truly loves Mr. Chen, but she hesitates and does not dare to move forward bravely. She resents her husband but also hopes he will turn back. She wants to distance herself from Mr. Chen, but she also pities Mr. Chen's situation. She always unconsciously volunteers to help him with anything she can. She doesn't know what her future holds, and she doesn't know if Mr. Chen loves her, or if Mrs. Chen will refuse to marry Mr. Chen in the future? She also fantasizes about what she should do if Mr. Chen were to clearly express his love for her. These are all the thoughts that surged through her mind as she was organizing Mr. Chen's clothes. She felt her face was a little flushed and her head a little dizzy, so she sat down and rested on the coffee table for a while.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Mr. Chen walked over and asked earnestly.</p>
<p>"I just feel a little dizzy. This is something that happens to me often. It will be fine in a moment," Mrs. Li forced herself to look up.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen soaked a towel in cold water and covered it on her forehead, holding the back of her neck with one hand and said, "You lie down for a while!" Mrs. Chen really lay down on the sofa. Mr. Li took off her shoes and let her lie down more comfortably.</p>
<p>"You're working too hard. You should take care of your health," Mr. Chen stood beside her, like a caring nurse.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and said nothing. She only felt that such tenderness was something she had never experienced since marrying her husband. But she was very ashamed that she had received the tenderness of her husband's friend. At the same time, she was also very satisfied and happy. She forgot that this situation was suspicious and would lead to endless strange stories if seen by a third party. She took off the cold towel on her head and asked Mr. Chen to soak it in cold water again and put it back on. She also asked Mr. Chen to pour her a small cup of cold tea, which Mr. Chen fed her.</p>

<p>Gold Market Fluctuations Dominated Last Week</p>
<p>Conflicting News Led to Extreme Market Conditions</p>
<p>Last week's gold market experienced drastic changes, like a storm with turbulent waves and daily price differences of ten taels. This was due to conflicting international news and the volatile intentions of market participants, who lacked confidence. Both long and short positions were controlled by different sides. This coincided with the swap period, and prices fluctuated around 770 taels. Initially, short sellers posted about three taels for the October-November swap, which was the opposite of the previous period. This was due to the low inventory of spot goods. Later, the swap was squared, and long positions posted three to four cents. From the beginning of November, the opening price was 769.8 taels (slightly lower by 1.7 taels compared to October). Afterwards, major buyers competed to buy aggressively and broke through the 780-tael mark. Towards the weekend, a sudden wave of unexpected changes occurred, with a sharp drop of more than twenty taels, eventually falling to the 760-tael border. This was due to Japan's brutal actions in the East, causing panic and a gloomy atmosphere in the market. There was a total of 20 taels of reversal during the week. After consolidating (squaring the October-November swap), the price was still up 3.5 taels compared to the previous weekend. The overseas silver market trended downwards, but Shanghai's exchange rate was level. The internal market was slightly tight. Gold firms occasionally experienced congestion. Currently, sterling still dominates the short position, estimated at over one million pounds. Therefore, the spot gold (hedging) is in a long position. Dalian firms are still in a short position, while Guangdong firms and Yongheng, etc., are still in a long position. Speculators such as Wu, Luo, and Lu are also in a long position. The settlement price, calculated at the daily exchange rate, gradually converged, with a difference of only around 20 taels. Yesterday (the 19th), British silver bars rebounded. However, there are concerns that today (the 21st), Monday, will bring significant volatility to the gold market. The general situation of the week is summarized below.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Trends with Constant Changes. Since Monday, September 14, the near-term price of large silver bars remained unchanged, the far-term price slightly decreased by 0.0625, and the US silver price remained the same. The sterling price initially increased and then decreased, remaining the same as the previous Saturday. However, the internal market tightened, and gold firms mostly engaged in selling. Hedging was already squared. The spot gold price initially rose to 763.7 taels, then to 3.5 taels. Short sellers then quickly covered their positions as the swap period approached. It even broke through the 70-tael mark. At noon, it was 73.5 taels and closed at 3 taels. In the afternoon, it reached 3.9 taels, but due to more selling, it dropped to 70.05 taels, eventually closing at 72.7 taels, an increase of 9.6 taels compared to the previous Saturday. The total range of fluctuation was 10.4 taels. The next day, the near-term price of large silver bars decreased slightly by 0.0625, the far-term price remained unchanged, the silver price decreased slightly by 0.0125, and the sterling price remained unchanged. The internal market was stable. Sterling was within three pennies. Market participants mostly engaged in selling, and hedging was already squared. The spot gold price initially opened at 73.2 taels, then increased by 0.05 taels, then to 4.4 taels. Fortunately, the silver market was still in good condition. The US sold after closing, otherwise, the opening price would have been lower. Afterwards, major players unloaded their positions, and people lacked confidence, expecting that the swap price would not increase excessively. After 9:30, it broke into the 70-tael range, reaching 69.5 taels. The noon close was stable at 71.4 taels. In the afternoon, the market opened at 71 taels. Subsequently, private trading of swaps began, with long positions posting, initially at three taels, then at 2.7 taels. Afterwards, many major players were willing to swap out, causing the price to be suppressed. The swap was squared, then returned to around two taels. At 3:00, the market price dropped to 66.2 taels. After 4:00, it was heard that a certain money shop had dragged in, and the price rose to 73.7 taels, eventually closing at 2.9 taels, an increase of only 0.2 taels compared to the previous day. The daily range of fluctuation was 8.2 taels. On Wednesday, the price of large silver bars remained unchanged, the silver price decreased slightly by 0.0125, the sterling price remained unchanged, and the internal market seemed loose. Trading was not smooth. The gold market had officially started the swap period, still with short sellers posting. Initially, it was 1.45 to 1.3 taels, then 1.8 to 1.9 taels, the official posted price was 1.7 taels, and finally it was level. Long positions posted a few cents in between, and there was no trading in October. All trading was mainly in November. The opening price was 71.5 taels, and the closing price was 68.2 taels, a decrease of 4.7 taels compared to the previous day, based on the November price. When November entered the market, the opening price was 69.8 taels, then 71.2 taels, with fluctuations of five to six taels above and below. From 8:30, the price was 68.8 taels, and at 8:45 it was 72.9 taels. At noon, news suddenly spread that German debt had been extended for three years, causing a setback in confidence and a price of only 66 taels. The noon close was 68.2 taels. The afternoon market opened at 8.6 taels, reached 9.2 taels. Suddenly, news came that a certain bank had swapped in over 600 cash bars, causing the price to drop to 7.8 taels. After 3:00, it was heard that Japan had sent troops to the East, disrupting Shenyang. Speculation was rampant, and the price eventually reached 63.7 taels. However, long positions came to raise the price, so the closing price was 5.6 taels, a decrease of about 7 taels compared to the previous day. The daily range of fluctuation was 9.2 taels. On Thursday, the price of large silver bars remained unchanged, the silver price increased by 0.0125, the sterling price remained unchanged, and the internal market seemed strong. Market participants initially sold and then bought, and the market situation improved. The spot gold price initially reached 66 taels, and then, due to the loose exchange rate, the short positions were still high, and it was suppressed to 2.7 taels. Afterwards, Guangdong firms aggressively bought, and the exchange rate also rose sharply by 10 taels, reaching 73.5 taels after 11:00. The noon close was only 71.2 taels. The Dalian firms and Yuanmao sold off. The afternoon market opened at 69.8 taels, then 71.5 taels. Suddenly, HSBC offered sterling at 1.30625, causing the price to drop to 68.2 taels, then rebound by over three taels to 71.9 taels. Guangdong firms then entered again, but Yongfeng sold, retreating to 69.7 taels. However, Hengxing and others continued to enter without stopping, so the closing price was 70.07 taels, an increase of 5.1 taels compared to the previous day. The daily range of fluctuation was 10.8 taels. Major players such as Hengxing Sheng, Da Hengxing, Yuan, Lu, Kangxiang, Daifuxing, Yong Wang, etc., and a certain bank all continued to enter. Dalian firms continued to sell. On Friday, the price of large silver bars decreased slightly by 0.0125 to 0.0625, the silver price decreased slightly by 0.025, the price of British gold was halved, and the internal market also strengthened. Market participants bought aggressively, and the gold market opened with a price increase of 4.7 taels, reaching 75.4 taels, then 4.5 taels. Afterwards, it rose rapidly. Rumors spread that the silver price would be suppressed, and the exchange rate was tight. The general short positions rushed to cover their positions, almost reaching a peak. The price immediately broke through 80 taels, reaching 82 taels at noon, and closing at 80.08 taels. The afternoon market opened at 78.8 taels, then 9.5 taels. Afterwards, due to many buyers, the price reached 77.8 taels. Yongheng and others continued to enter, reaching 80.02 taels, eventually closing at 79.2 taels, an increase of 8.6 taels compared to the previous day. Speculators such as Luo and Lu all entered, adding to the long positions. Only Wu sold some. On Saturday, the price of large silver bars decreased by 0.0125, the price of US silver decreased by 0.0125, the sterling price increased by half a penny, and the internal market also loosened. This was truly unbelievable. The spot gold price was hit hard by the news of Japan sending troops to invade Eastern China and occupying important cities, as well as international discussions about setting a minimum silver price. The opening price was low, with a sharp drop of over 10 taels, reaching 64.5 taels. Dalian firms, Tongtaichang, Zhi, Yongfeng, Yuanmao, and Yong all aggressively sold goods. The initial price was 78 taels, then within 60 taels. Because there was no dark trading on the Bund, the price fluctuated and was extremely chaotic, reaching 62 taels, then rising sharply by 10 taels at 10:30 to 73 taels as Dalian firms and Yongheng bought in. After 11:00, news suddenly spread that the military situation between China and Japan in Eastern China was tense, and the price dropped by 10 taels to 63.5 taels. The closing price was 66.6 taels, a decrease of 12.75 taels compared to the previous day. The daily range of fluctuation was 11 taels. Japanese speculators tended to sell. Dalian firms bought in due to the rising exchange rate. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver, as well as exchange rates and spot gold, are listed below.</p>

<p>Bond Market Fluctuations Were Significant Last Week</p>
<p>Significant Continued Declines, Slight Increase in Consolidated and Salt Taxes</p>
<p>Trading Volume of 12.8 Million</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market in Shanghai saw sparse spot trading. The entire week only saw a volume of 12,000 yuan. The futures market, however, continued to be extremely active, with daily trading volume remaining high. The lively atmosphere in the market did not diminish. Except for one day at the weekend, where the trading volume reached over 40 million, setting a new record, the first two days of the week and Thursday each saw over 1.5 million yuan. The total trading volume for the entire week was 12,847,000 yuan, a decrease of only 1 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, consolidated tax bonds were the most active, while the trading volume of salt tax bonds exceeded the 20-year customs bonds. Consolidated tax bonds accounted for 3.337 million, with 2.11 million for September and 1.217 million for October. Salt tax bonds accounted for 1.82 million for September and 1.1595 million for October. 20-year customs bonds accounted for 1.7795 million for September and 736,000 for October. Trading in other bonds remained flat. 20-year bonds accounted for 765,000 for September and 409,500 for October. Troop reduction bonds accounted for 440,005 yuan for September and 337,000 yuan for October. 1929 customs bonds accounted for 501,000 for September and 195,500 for October. 1929 good bonds accounted for 443,000 for September and 295,500 for October. Reorganization bonds accounted for 511,500 yuan. 1996 bonds accounted for 13,300 yuan. Customs bonds accounted for 410,000 yuan, and financial bonds accounted for 300,000 yuan. Financial bonds accounted for only 25,000 yuan. Regarding the price fluctuations of various bonds during the week, from the beginning of the week to Friday, the market situation was depressed due to the tense political situation. Market confidence was unstable. Although daily fluctuations remained significant, the trend fluctuated inconsistently, and there was no consensus. However, retail investors actively invested, and prices tended to increase. Only on the weekend, due to the barbarous actions of the Japanese in invading Northeast China and occupying important cities, market confidence was greatly shaken. In addition, the situation in Guangdong was also difficult to be optimistic about. Investor confidence was extremely weak, and selling was very active. Bond prices fell sharply across the board, with daily declines reaching around 3 yuan. The September troop reduction bonds even fell to the limit price and trading was suspended. The extent of the changes was unprecedented in recent months. As a result, the prices of overall land continued to decrease by several yuan compared to the previous week. Reorganization, troop reduction, and 20-year bonds also decreased by about 1.5 yuan. Only the consolidated and salt tax bonds secured by the guarantee fund increased more from Monday to Friday, and their prices were slightly stronger. The bond market situation is not optimistic for the time being. The high and low price statistics for each bond in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan).

<h3>Yarn</h3>
<p>Yarn prices varied last week</p>
<p>Standard yarn prices rose by two taels. The yarn market appeared quite unstable at the beginning of the week due to the weakness of the global situation and the downward trend of raw cotton, which made people more pessimistic. Later, a certain merchant dumped a large quantity of yarn, and as the end of the month approached, the shortage of deliveries for this month was slightly offset. However, there were fewer new sellers, so the market sentiment was stirred up. At one point, some actual sales stimulated the rural market, and the market turned upward. At the weekend, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, and there was deep concern that the anti-Japanese movement would become tense again, so general speculators bought in, and some even switched from short to long positions, pushing prices even higher. However, the overseas cotton yarn situation continued to trend downward, to a point where it seemed irrecoverable. During the week, the actual sales by out-of-town merchants were also lackluster. Prices for various months of standard yarn rose by two taels compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Around 30,000 to 40,000 bales of foreign cotton were traded, and there was concern that the cotton market would decline. This was because American cotton was trending downward and new low prices were gradually emerging. The current spot price for Middling cotton was only around 27 taels. However, most people in this city believed that the severe disasters in all regions and the poor harvests would inevitably lead to shortages in the future. Therefore, most cotton merchants who held long positions were reluctant to let go, and the market stabilized. However, the global cotton industry was in a severe slump, and there was deep concern that there would be a drastic change in the future of domestic cotton, with a greater likelihood of a decline in prices. This week, 30,000 to 40,000 bales of cheap foreign cotton were traded, and the trading volume of domestic cotton decreased. Prices for various months of Hankou standard cotton fell slightly by 2.5 mace compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Approaching the Six-Cent Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton futures fell by 13 to 16 points due to increased receipts, a weak Wall Street, and pressure from sellers. Spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the weakness of American cotton and the liquidation of long positions, but later strengthened due to good news from Liverpool and short covering. Bengal fell by 2.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 2.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 3 rupees. (Telegraph from the 19th)</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The decline in the river rice market intensifies again</p>
<p>Sources from various regions in the southern market, such as Qingpu, Sijing, and Xitang, brought a total of over ten batches of thin rice. Only four to five hundred piculs were sold in the market. There was still a large accumulation of both new and old goods in the Pudong River area. People were pessimistic. Prices for new Yang Du Jian rice each fell by three dimes. Although there was little early Changshu Beigeng rice delivered, there was no appetite in the city shops due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, and the opening price was lowered by one dime. Fengjing's new Canjian rice and new粳 rice were in abundant supply but weak demand, and the price of damaged rice fell by two dimes. The sales of Bianyin Yuan rice in Erdi Pavilion and Lin Tuncun's early rice were all weak.</p>
<p>Twenty to thirty batches arrived at Xinzha yesterday, and the situation was in a state of collapse. There was a considerable amount of thick粳 Zhongguan rice. Early and late rice arrived in large quantities, sales were sluggish, and prices fell by three to four dimes. The outlets for Lu Yangjian and Bianyin Yuan rice were increasingly scarce. There was still some buying interest in the river warehouses, but it was dormant. There were slight sales of new粳 and new Yang Du Jian rice. The prices were extremely weak and shortened by five to six cents. Because the price of Bu Jian rice was relatively low, the shops still had some demand, but the situation was slightly weak. There were 1,500 to 1,600 dan of various goods in the river factories.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Trading quiet, market firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas. It happened to be Sunday, and there were no arrivals. The buying interest in the market clearing was weak. The exchange rate was looking soft, so the transactions were very sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24, coarse granulated white, old stock 11 taels 5 mace, new stock 11 taels 6 mace, high-quality stock 11 taels 6 mace. No. 20, medium granulated white, 11 taels 1 mace for old stock. Both import and export were sluggish, and the market situation appeared flat. Dutch red sugar No. 9, 9 taels 5 mace, the trend was still firm. Taikoo sugar B mark 12 taels 7.5 cents, DY mark 12 taels, HM mark 11 taels 5.75 cents to 11 taels 5.5 cents, H mark 10 taels 5.5 cents, O mark 9 taels 4 cents. Shipments were particularly scarce, and the market situation was quite good. Very few transactions were made in the market clearing. The original plate of this factory's ice continued to be sold, and the opening market was quite firm. Xiu Nan Shenglong sold 1,000 bags of Dutch red sugar No. 8 for 9 taels 3.5 mace, and the market was not weak.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods</h3>
<p>The opening price of new Tong'an dried longan is high</p>
<p>Three batches of new Tong'an dried longan have arrived, and the number is not large. However, due to the entanglement of the mold season, they have been held up for many days. Now that it has been resolved, more than 200 boxes were officially opened yesterday. The top grade opened at around 56 taels, the upper-middle grade at around 45 taels, and the next grade ranged from 27 to 28 taels.</p>
