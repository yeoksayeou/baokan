<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕消息靈通方面提供本報記者以尙待證實之消息，即在華蘇軍可能與在華美軍採取平行行動。按蘇軍三月一日（至遲二月三日）自東北撤盡之期瞬即屆臨，而截至現在除赤峯蘇軍已於廿三日撤退外，東北蘇軍尙無如期撤退之跡象。據悉，蘇軍本通知中國當局，赤峯·承德·多倫之錢廿日撤退，長春鐵路沿錢十五日開始撤退，至二月一日撤盡，刻東北蘇軍遲遲未撤原因，據蘇方表示，由於缺乏火車燃料。關於長春·瀋陽兩地，並非國軍不能接防，而係因國軍力量尙屬單薄，故仍由蘇負責。蔣夫人東北之行，來去匆匆，官方解釋來去四日本係預定計劃，但亦有人謂由于長春氣候太冷。沈怡刻仍在長春，侯市政人員多數到達後，再赴大連。安東主席高惜冰可能在故都度舊歲，熊式輝主任來平，係因在前方過久，回平與後方取聯絡，不久仍將返錦。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕中外矚目已久的二月初風雪下的東北九省，和這時期以前的情勢，將沒有什麼不同，蘇方雖然就要撤兵了，但是燃料和車輛的困難，將使他們有足够的時間，對於中國的大局推移，多看幾看。雖然國府巳有七八位省主席，市長走馬上任了，但是接收在實質上還停留在象徵的階段，瀋陽的置文琦市長，至今還是太和旅館裏的一名旅客，和他差不了多少的許多主席，大概還不曾踢出「頭三脚」。東北的氣候太冷了，熊式煇·杜聿明因吃不消，先後鬧病，就是僕僕風麋的老少年張嘉璈，在長春也天天頭痛。在西北風沙中開發玉門油礦的孫錦琦，今天剛從長春回來，好像也受了病的備染，神色頹然，說他不預備去東北吧，他的職務是負責接收東北工礦的特派員。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕東北局勢短期難明朗化，東北行營仍將暫遷僻處一隅之錦州，熊主任返平後，已着手籌備此事，日內即遺八大處負責人員各一人前往布置。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平卅日電〕今日自東北行營某高級官員處獲悉：蘇重自東北各警備區撤退之工作，正全面進行中，但因氣候情形不良，運輸工具及燃料缺乏，影響國軍之接收工作，故蘇軍之撤退，或不克按照預定計劃完成·</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美駐蘇大使哈里曼偕女公子迦娜蓮，於昨午（卅日）抵滬，定今晨飛日本，轉道回團。此次哈里曼將軍回國原因，魏德邁將軍於招待記者時，未予發表。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨魏德邁將軍於建設大樓招待本市新聞記者，暢談一小時，答覆各記者之詢問：</p>
<p>（一）美船轉讓或售與中國一事，中美政府正在交涉中，目前並無船隻轉讓或出售，惟過渡期間，魏氏奉令有權處置其所轄之六自由輪。此六輪之運用，將遵從將委員長之意志，以運輸軍隊並撤退日僑。</p>
<p>（二）停戰令正在逐漸順利進行，雖有零星戰事，大體情形良好·外傳自天津至秦皇烏之火車一列，曾在唐山附近被搶擊事，魏氏未有所聞。</p>
<p>（三）馬歇爾特使來滬時，與魏氏談話之內容，主要爲如何可使魏氏指揮下之美軍，協助調處執行部進行工作，尤其如交通及無線電等方面，現北平已成立一無線電總站，指揮並聯絡派往各處之小隊。此外亦曾談起中國戰區之美軍復員，積分滿點者，應遣送回國，同時仍留一部份執行任務。魏氏否認曾勸馬帥勿赴徐州。</p>
<p>（四）美軍從未直接運輸新六軍至東北，僅自水道將國軍運至秦皇島葫蘆島二處，再深入即無美國八員或交通器具參加運輸。美軍從未空運國軍至東北，美記者請求至東北採訪事，彼已電蔣委員長請求，尙無答覆。</p>
<p>（五）撤退日僑事，自經去年杜魯門總統發表政策後，已加緊進行，去年十二間祇撤退三萬人，但目前則已撤至三十萬人。（包括至台灣者在內）。</p>
<p>（六）麥帥曾令，中國軍隊未到達之前，美軍應協助中國政府受降然後將日俘及兵器交與中國政府。至於遣送日俘日僑回國事，美軍之任務僅爲協助及監察，實際工作係中國之責任。</p>
<p>魏氏因上海交通情形頗見紊亂，擬往訪錢市長商談補救辦法，出席各記者對此頗多建議，魏氏均予接受。</p>

<p>長春現在已是殘冬的時候，殘冬的結束，會緊緊跟來了春天，長春的命名雖叫長春，而長春人和任何地方的人一樣，對於殘冬，只感到窒息，對於春天，是迫切地期待。</p>
<p>蔣夫人這次到長春，肩負着代表中央政府，蔣主席和關內同胞，慰問在日本帝國主義鐵蹄下面，受了整整十四年磨折的東北同胞。她帶了一顆火熱的心，在長春，將這火熱的力量，散發到東北九省，使東北四千萬顆心，都感到溫暖了。現在季節雖還木步入春天，然而，東北的人，尤其是長春，都彷彿感到，他們盼望的春天，已經來臨人聞。</p>
<p>東北從日本鐵蹄之下解放出來，現在已經過了整整五個多月，漫長的十四年的煎熬，固然難受，而五個多月來，若十地方，散兵游勇的作亂，使他們在過去十四年中，雖然苦，但還可以在苟延殘喘下偸度某種程度的安定歲月，竟都不能保留。他們對於祖國八年抗戰換來的勝利！固然興奮，但於勝利後，環顧他們的實際生活，不禁有感慨如南柯一夢。「難道東北人是命中注定了多災多難」？他們捫心自問，他們感到了徬徨。</p>
<p>蔣夫人來了，在迷惘中感到了一種鎭定的力量，四千萬顆孤寂無依的心，由於蔣夫人帶來了火熱的一顆心，於是，緊緊地凝結在一起，衝破了萬里長城，從此無所謂關外關裏。黃帝的子孫本來是一家，一家人痛癢是相關的，此地的冷落，溫暖地方的人宣在也負有責任。</p>
<p>蔣夫人是廿二日下午兩點鐘到的長春。美齡號飛機降落在機塲的前半個小時，張嘉璈。蔣經國。董彥平諸氏，哈爾濱·瀋陽·長春·松江·吉林各地的婦女代表，都在機塲竚候，蘇軍馬林諾夫斯基元帥的代表，也同時在機塲迎駕。機塲中使人注意的，蔣經國張嘉數兩氏和蘇聯軍官的談話，儀隊樂隊等，固然是目標，而抱着一束鮮花，準備戲給蔣夫人的年僅十一歲的賈錦生小妹妹，更是記者們攝影的對象。</p>
<p>賈錦生是個怪聰明而可憐的小妹妹，她現在正在該小學三年級，姊妹四人，她最大，第二個和最小的都是弟弟，而最小的弟弟，現在僅有四歲·父親賈桂林，因爲作地下工作，在三十三年五月一日，被日本人殘害而死，死的時侯，只有三十五歲，留下一妻四兒，孤兒寡婦們的生活，這幾年來全賴工作同志們負担。當記者問到她時，他說：「爹爹死時，媽媽和我都在錦州姥姥家住，得到訊趕到這裏來，爹爹已經死了，現在媽媽常在家害病」。</p>
<p>蔣夫人的飛機到了機塲上空，往迎的人，排隊站在跑道旁邊，兩點鐘正，機身着響，軍樂悠揚聲中，蔣經國氏上機扶下了蔣夫人。經介紹機塲往迎的人並獻花後，蘇軍馬元帥代表即致詞，之後，檢閱儀隊，乘車離開了機塲，而這一刹那間，中外記者的開麥拉拍照聲，雖在樂聲中，依然可以清晰地聰到。</p>
<p>東子馳上了大這，迎面遇着歡迎蔣夫人的市民，兩條長蛇，夾立道旁，夫人下直步行了一段，向他們含笑注視爲禮，而市民總在萬人以上，很早就在道旁等候，見着夫人，高聲歡呼，正好像要把他們多年來積壓在胸中的抑鬱，悶氣，苦哀，完全在夫人面前傾述個淋漓盡致。夫人的車子已經開到遠遠的街的彼端，而歡呼的聲音，仍在耳後震天價響。</p>
<p>街上有着保安部隊和蘇軍警衛，每隔一丈遠，便可以看到他們持槍肅立的雄姿，，中蘇軍隊的友好合作，在這一時間，得到了具體的說明。</p>
<p>可惜蔣夫人今天又離開了長春，僅僅在長春不足三天逗留的時間中，實在令人覺得這三天是如何的短暫。但是，蔣夫人曾對婦女代表們說：在她離開重慶後這幾天中，蔣主席已經拍了三次電報，促她返渝，而她在重慶也有許多事待理。此次不能到瀋陽，哈爾濱等地去慰問，深深覺得遺憾，但在最近期間，蔣主席和她會再來東北。</p>
<p>東北人民是如何地愛戴蔣主席和蔣夫人，不要談到其他，以交通不太方便的現在，遠在濟哈等地的婦女代表，很早便來長春迎候，她們都渴欲見到夫人一面，把她們這多年來悲慘的生活遭遇，向全國締運的領導者蔣夫人，盡情陳述，使未來的命運，得到再造的機會，還有在十八日開始舉行的蔣主席夫婦生活照片展覽會中，一述六日，前往參觀的人絡繹不絕，冷落了很久的大經小學，在風雪東北，居然也熱鬧一時，再街頭商店，在聽到蔣夫人要來長春時，許多門前掛出了「歡迎蔣夫人蒞長的標語，尤其是在大馬路一帶，幾家較大的商塲，更作得精緻美觀。</p>
<p>東北的人民，在蔣夫人未來時，熱切地盼望，來了時，熱烈地歡迎，離去了，覺得逗留的時間過於短暫。然而，蔣夫人帶來的這一顆火熱的心，是留在了長春，由長春將散發到東北九省。</p>
<p>蔣夫人從廿二日下午兩點鐘來到長春，廿五日上午八點鐘離開這裏，在長春雖住了三夜，但所有時間還不到七十個小時。她在廿三日上午巡視了市區，對於日本壓榨東北同胞所建立的官廳會社區域，雖然所過都是立體建築，但都匆匆走馬觀花而過，相反地，對於市民麕集的住宅區，越是低矮簡陋破敗，越是凝神注視，所以她在廿四日正午市民大會席上演說時，她說她已看出了東北人民的貧困，在日本帝國主義無情的壓榨下，亟待救濟，因此，她決定在返渝之後，發動一個募賑會。同時令善後救濟總署運來物資，對東北人民的貧困，作有效而普遍地解決。的確，十四年前富庶的東北，現在是變了相，日本人雖壓榨够了，但春夢一塲，化爲烏有。</p>
<p>廿三日下午行營召開的茶會和授勳席上，對帮助我們收復東北的蘇聯盟友，夫人代表主席頒贈勲章。馬林諾夫斯基元帥回國競選未在長，代表他致詞的人，特別表示敬意，在這次茶會裏，張嘉璈氏說明工大人這次來長，的意義對於東北似乎存在的雨層雲霧，人民對於政府的疑慮以及中蘇兩國的友好，統同會因夫人的蒞臨而吿消逝。同天，夫人並到醫院參觀，慰問死難地下工作同志的家屬。</p>
<p>廿四日，蔣夫人不單參觀了蘇軍司令部，出席了市民大會，和各界代表茶會，而且還參觀了孤兒院，夜裏更赴蘇軍在前關東軍司令部舉行的歡宴</p>
<p>在蘇軍司令部參觀，對於士兵問到了他們的經歷，問到了他們槍砲的火力和射擊法，更問到了他們午間要吃什麼飯，打開了鍋蓋，看着熱氣蒸騰的肉湯，指問了許久．臥室中，鋪得過窄的位置，似乎不能容納下去一個人的身體，問，是否能够擠下那樣多的人，這裏還吃了一餐飯，使幾個白依侍女大忙一陣。</p>
<p>市民大會中，蔣夫人的演說，更深深感動了聽衆，而夫人在演說時，對於束北的苦難，險上表現出無限同情，雙目濕潤，使十四年受宰割的東北人民，深心烙上了一個永遠不能忘懷的烙痕。這裏有工人趙魁武代表市民致詞，他在興奮與喜悅中，說出了他對於東北的希望，國家的希望。</p>
<p>夜裹蘇軍在前關東軍司令部裏爲夫人設宴招特，堂皇富麗的關東軍司令部，開着高度的暖氣，使人彷彿是在春天，而許多個侍女，露出雪白的藕臂，穿梭般奔忙，絕不會令人覺得這是在軍營中張宴，一位侍女，倚着牆邊，竟把鞋子脫掉，單是一層遮肉的絲襪，在挺厚的地氈上劃着道子。餐應四壁，都懸有中蘇國旗，放得極大的孫總理·列寗的造像和蔣主席·史達林大元帥的肖像·在餐廳的兩邊懸着，而中蘇賓主共有百人左右，幾乎是每兩位中國人，旁邊就有一位盟友，或者一男一女作陪。爲兩國友好乾杯，爲兩國元首乾杯·爲蔣夫人乾杯·伏特加·白蘭地·啤酒放滿案頭，一杯一杯地乾下去·對於盟友們的豪飲·簡直令人佩服。席間蔣夫人的演說，每句都博得熱烈掌聲，而掌聲起軍樂聲隨起，混合起來，掌聲更爲雷動。主席特洛曾科將軍，特別說明兩國友好基礎應建立在經濟合作與文化合作兩方面。蔣夫人把過去日本納粹法西斯帝國主義對我國所談的合作，痛加批評·而對中蘇間的合作，認爲是基於認識而來，故能達到眞正的合作。</p>
<p>宴後在另一類似影戲院的大廳裏看電影，放映了一部紅塲上的勝利檢閱，和運動大會，而第二部片子上，蔣經國氏兩次在銀幕上出現。</p>
<p>說到蔣經國氏，從夫人來長春和地跟着一道兒走了，這不到七十個小時中，他是最忙碌的一位。中蘇語言都由他翻譯，所以每次有中蘇人士聚在一堂的時候，他恐怕是最苦的時候。（方仁·一月廿五日）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦三十日廣播稱：安全理事會今日下午開會，首由伊朗代表致詞，據稱：「蘇聯代表稱蘇伊兩國實際上已進行直接談判，此點不確，伊方會兩次表示願意遣派代表赴莫斯科，均遭拒絕。兩國交換牒文，不能視作直接談判。至此，伊代表略停數秒鐘，而以低微之音聲稱，「安全理事會絕對不能放棄處理伊朗申訴，但上次會議時，蘇方已提議兩方直接談判，如安全會認爲伊朗確應直接談判則伊朗自當遵命，但一切談判均將在安全會監導下進行，伊朗絕不願見安全會放棄處理此項申訴。至此，蘇聯代表維辛斯基起立宣稱，伊朗願意直接談判，蘇聯至爲滿意。但伊方建議談判應在安全會監導下進行，關於此點，本人有所申述·如伊朗並非僅在口頭上而實際上願意求得安全者，則唯一方法厥爲兩方面之談判，而不應置於安全會管理之下。就蘇聯政府觀之，去年兩國交換牒文，並未經過第三者，故可視爲直接談判。伊朗北部之事件，絕非由蘇聯軍隊之壓力所造成，而係亞塞拜爾然人民之眞正表示。旋由美代表史丁紐斯建議一種妥協約解決辦法，由中法波三國代表予以支持。史氏建議聽候雙方直接談判，但安全會得隨時獲得關於談判進行之消息，直至獲得公平與滿意之解決爲止。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三十日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日繼續討論蘇伊糾紛，據揣測或可有妥協之解決辦法。安全理事會可能讓兩國直接談判，但須將談判經過報吿安全理事會。伊朗新總理沙丹納今日致電英首相艾德禮，重申英伊聞友好關係，內稱：「相信英國必能帮助伊朗人民完遂其公正而合法之志願」。</p>

<p>〔路透社奧斯洛三十日電〕挪威外長賴依已接受安全理事會邀請出任聯合國機構秘書長，於令晨九時三十分離此飛往倫敦，聯合國大會或將於星期五會議時，正任核准賴依之任命。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日專電〕五强間對聯合國秘書長候選人之進取問題，終獲圓滿解決。安全理事會本晚舉行秘密會議，十一個理事國上致同意提出挪威外長賴依，担任聯合國最高行政職位。安全理事會主席梅金業當即急電挪京徵求同意，由是關於此一問題之僵局，乃行打開。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕安全理事會一致舉薦挪威外長賴依需聯合國機構首任秘書長，使威斯特敏斯特之代表及觀察家均感滿意。賴依被公認爲最適當之候選人，除其個人之德操外，尙有二點爲一般人所感覺欣喜：（一）衆認此項決議，係五强在秘密會議中所議定，可見安全理事會之常任理事，已不允再爲組織問題演成分裂局面。（二）聯合國會址旣已設在美國，故以歐人担任秘書長一職，較爲平衡·賴氏當選以後，其所握之政治權限，當遠較舊國際聯盟之秘書長爲大，渠可將任何足以威脅世界和平與安全之事件，向安全理事會提出，而聯合國機構之二千名職員，亦將受其控制。賴氏就任後，當首先任派職員，由五十一國中縝密遴選，被選之人應宣誓放棄原職，一心爲聯合國服務，受秘書長之調遺。賴依更須準備聯合國機構之預算，管理其收入及支出，渠並得爲各國政府担任居間人或顧問。秘書長年俸九千鎊。可獲免費房屋，渠及助理秘書長及各人之妻兒，均李受外交特權。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕勝選　聯合國秘書長之挪威外長賴依出身微賤，現年五十，乃木匠之子，身材肥雄姿英發，是一個研究勞工法律師，夙有談判交涉的天才。賴氏於一九四一年就任挪威外長時，並沒有國際外交背景，但由他的一生事業，顯示其對於挪威政治和勞工法，有奮激的興趣。挪威人都知道他有排難解紛，使雙方妥協約本傾。賴依空閒的時候，大部分消磨在滑雪和拍網球，賴依名特立格天，生於挪京，一九一九年在奧斯斯陸大學法科畢業後，即任挪威工黨秘書長，一九二二年任挪威工會聯盟法律顧問。一九三九年他已是工商業及運輸部長，一九四〇年德軍入寇，賴氏是最後離開奧斯陸的一個間員。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕聯合國現正計劃於二月十日結束其在倫敦之會議，聯合國機構各秘書間頗多患感冒者，致大會不得不宣佈明日休息，而下次全體會議延至週五舉行。然昨夜一般委員會會議中，估計至二月十日當可吿一段落，決定大會事務之一般委員會現正加緊工作，使大會工作之委員會階段，得於週五完畢，俾週五午後與週六得舉行大會全體會議，屆時由各委員會提出具報吿書。至下週初，大會當可準備進行其休會前之最後重要任務，即選舉國際法庭之法官是，此舉或將費數日，但若在週一或週二開始此工作，則距今尙有數日可處理任何代表團或將提出之最後建議。大會休會後，安全理事會仍將似續工作。但料理事會於下週杪以前之議程中，將列入伊朗希臘與印度尼西亞三項政治問題。大會首屆會議之第二部將在美國舉行，其日期尙待大會決定。原來建議四月間在美舉行，或將改期，因三强已決定五月間在巴黎召開和平大會也。刻正在來倫敦途巾，俾出席大會會議之主要政治家，有法國外長畢都爾，挪威外長賴依，及希臘新外長　迪士。畢都爾已於今晨自巴黎啓程來英，賴依亦已自奧斯洛出發，蘭迪士可望於明日自雅典動身前來倫敦，代蘇非諾波里斯率領希臘代表團。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦州日電〕托治委員會昨開會時，對於附屬土地是否應一律獲得實際獨立及自治政府一點，曾發生分岐之意見。美代表杜爾斯認爲受託國家應保證此等權利，以給予當地人民以希望及勇氣。而比利時代表奧爾特則謂若干土地，事實上無能完成獨立或自治，如憲章訂立保證之規定，則此等土地亦將要求此等權利矣。故渠主張托治國家不必提出保證，僅須立即協助附屬土地，達到可以完成獨立及自治政府之水準。澳洲代表貝萊贊成比代表之意，而美代表杜爾斯復辯稱。「憲章中附有獨立及自治政府之名辭，並不使聯合國必須受法律性之束縛，吾人乃實際政治家而非律師，故應允許人民獨立以資切實」。委員會當議定將美比代表不同之意見，交小組委員會響　。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯昨稱，庫頁島南部及千島列島之正式讓與蘇聯，尙須由和平條約規定之。按美國代理國務卿艾克遜於貝爾納斯在倫敦時，曾發表談話，謂耶爾達會議關於北太平洋區之議決案，不得認爲最後之決定。而蘇聯通訊社又申明耶爾達協定中關於此等島嶼之議決，乃係最後之決定，故貝爾納斯國務卿特於昨日向報界發表談話，闡明立塲。蘇聯通訊社評艾克遜之言謂，「艾氏謂就渠所知，耶爾達協定並不能認爲係將千島列島讓與蘇聯之最後議定，艾氏復謂此乃渠個人之意見，或不免錯誤云云。蘇聯通訊社奉令特爲聲明，即艾克遜之言確屬錯誤云」。貝爾納斯謂，渠雖參加耶爾達會議，然自日本投降以後，始聞悉該項協定，渠信杜魯門總統大的亦在同時始悉此項協定。想協定之簽訂，係在會議之最後一日，渠業已不復在塲。羅斯福故總統以該項文件之機密性，故親自密藏白宮之內·蘇聯在克里米亞會議中，原巳同意於預定日期對日發動戰事，故如關於千島列島之協定宣佈過早，則人人均知蘇聯有進攻日本少寫矣·　故總校簽訂該項協定牌，當認美賺政府應於適當時期簽訂和平條約，以支持該地之正式移讓濃聯。杜魯書門總統亦具肩』意見，在波茨坦會　中議定西　西重之讓與波蘭時，固亦有此　示·貝爾納斯復證實關於北太平洋之協定，非爲口頭協定而係　面協定，目前如予發表亦無不可·員爾納斯不願談及其他太平洋中美國願意成立託治之各島嶼，僅謂美國攻府認爲此等事件，均須由和平條約解決之。</p>

<p>〔中央社曼谷三十日專電〕我國代表團長李鐵錚，因渠於二十七日遊歷納康巴棠時，該地發生排華事件，已向暹政府提出抗議，渠要求對攻擊華僑之肇事者，予以適當懲罰，暹政府保證此後予華僑以適當保護。談判中暹友好條約之暹首席代表溫惠泛耶公王子，昨日往訪李鐵錚，代表暹政府對於不幸事件之發生，表示歉意。</p>
<p>〔中央社納康巴棠廿七日專電〕中暹友好條約簽字四日，中甫暹邦交即發生波折。納康巴棠城內今發生排華事件，僑胞被害者一人，受傷者數人，此事件係於我國代表團在李鐵錚率領下前來該城時發生者。該城在曼谷以西五十五公里。綜觀全部經渦，會爲有組織而預謀之挑撥性行動，可能係由圖謀破壞之暹激烈分子所發起，以拘我國代表團示威而破報兩國友誼，納康巴棠城僑胞歡迎代表團大會甫開，即發生此事件，該城全體僑胞數千人均參加此會，該城縣長及警察局長亦與會，李鐵錚及該城縣長均强調兩國友誼並敦促兩國人民和睦。李氏亦勸僑胞遵守法律，並解釋中暹友好條約之締訂，彼等已自暹國政府得獲優遇。大會進行至此尙吿順利，迨李氏一行離會前，往當地三民主義靑年團支部時，槍聲突作，與會僑胞乃紛紛奔避，全城頓陷於恐怖及混亂狀態，而頃刻之間該城從所未有之在歡慶祝感况，亦隨而消失。李團長鐵錚於混亂中，仍保鎭靜，續乘車往華僑學校赴該城僑胞所設之歡迎午宴，關於事實眞相，至下午我國代表團自該城以西三十公里班邦歸來後始明。歡迎大會完畢後，多次事件相繼迅速發生，暹警察及無賴等於會塲附近開始毆擊僑胞，某僑胞於會議完畢時，突開有高呼之聲，渠方擬探視，即遭槍擊，背部要害中兩彈，另一僑胞則面部被刺傷，對其行兇之暹人，後被放兩暹人於混亂中乘隙搶刦，兩僑胞肉販兩合夥僑胞不但被强行搶去三千暹幣，且遭毒毆，該兩匪徒並恐嚇將於夜間焚毀彼等之住屋。李鐵錚等一行，自班邦返納康巴棠後，即往醫院視察遇害僑胞之遺體，該城縣長及警察局長對李氏來訪南城時，竟發生如此事件一節，深致歉意。渠等保證將竭力彈壓雙方以後之摩擦，且將此事呈吿曼谷上峯。自槍擊案件發生後，該城警察局長即令所有暹警一律歸局，然暹警雖歸局，而暹無賴之徒於晚間復操棍棒及其他武器，橫行不法，每遇僑胞即加以毒毆，故情勢益形嚴重。李鐵錚及該城警察局長於醫院中等待騐屍結果時，其他騷亂復大起，從事拆毀歡迎大會竹棚之僑胞又遭成羣之暹羅惡徒痛毆。某僑胞頭部及面部均遭擊破，送入醫院，情形之緊張，使防守該區之前荷軍戰俘，建議以中立者地位担任暹警察之工作。李鐵錚及該城縣長或予接受，故荷軍巡邏隊及機槍隊，乃警衛全城。我國代表團等至晚間得獲退方當局保證，決彈壓同等事件之爆發後，始行離去，由該城縣長伴送至離城甚遠之安全地帶。據悉，李鐵錚抵曼谷時，將此事對暹羅政府採取適當步驟。</p>

<p>— 本報廿五日重慶航訊　趙造生寄</p>
<p>一月二十五日，重慶－這個光榮的城市，因萬餘熱情靑年純真的呼聲而發光了。這一天，在全國靑年人的記憶中。是一個光彩的日子，開花的日子。</p>
<p>重慶沙磁區的中央大學，重慶大學，中央工校，中大附中，重慶中學，蜀都中學，四川敎育學院，同立商職，國立個專，育才學校等萬倫學生，爲促進協商會成功，及向英法抗議屛山機塲與白爾丁事件，舉行聯合遊行請願，他們行動組織的嚴密，秩序的良好，樹立了最優秀的民主運動的模楷·</p>
<p>用被章做大</p>
<p>這次大規模的行動，最先由中大發起，他們本先舉行科系代表大會，決定了組織，主張，宣言，口號，二十五日淸早三點鐘，吃了一點隔夜的稀飯，就開始準備出發。他們用自己的被單，用松林坡上砍下的竹桿，堅起大　，冷雨擋不住靑年人熱情的脚步，三十多公里的長途挫不了他們的熱情和決心，從沙壩起，這支洪大的隊伍，以院系爲單位，組織成大隊中隊，浩浩蕩蕩的向重慶市進發。沙坪壩的老百姓，放鞭砲助他們的行色。敎職員沿途組織服務站，爲這光榮的隊伍服務，中大柏溪分校的同學，前一天下午才知道這個消息，雖然這數千人，過江趕路都有問題，然而他們沒有躊躇，沒有考慮，澈夜未睡，趕製標語旗幟，午夜冒雨過江，趕往與大隊會合。</p>
<p>车中印「快報」</p>
<p>從化龍橋直排到李子壩，多壯大的隊伍多光彩的旗幟，多整齊的行列廈多宏大的呼喊呵！中大吳有訓校長，沙學浚，任美　，歐陽着，劉世超。蔣孟引等敎授，重大張洪沅校長，馬寅初敎授，以及各校助敎講師甚至校工等都在行列中。宣傳汽車在散發標語，宣言，並在車中印刷着「快報」。學生們每人都佩着代表自己院系身份的符號，中大學生穿着學校發的灰軍服，衣履雖然比八年前的學生寒傖，但這正是他們光榮苦鬥的標記，糾察騎着自行車前後左右的開路，行至化龍橋附近，在隊伍中，發現兩個行跡可疑的人，馬上被檢舉出來，並押交憲兵，以往種種事實的敎訓，使中國的靑年沉着淸醒，培卷出了他們高度的警覺性。</p>
<p>在牛角沱，碰見馬歇爾特使乘着五星元帥的轎車經過，他緩緩的隨着遊行的行列走向淸寺。</p>
<p>十一點多鐘，大隊到達國民政府，一會，中國柏溪分校的隊伍也趕到了，五十多公里的長途，累得他們滿身是汗，全體向他們鼓掌致慰·這時，從國府大禮堂的最高一層合階到大門外，是一望無際的羣衆，各種顏色的大小旗幟·成千成萬的隨着大瞰而來的民衆，擠在國府門前，國府路的交通，完全斷絕了。</p>
<p>孫科堅決保證</p>
<p>「政治協商會議只許成功不許失敗！」「國家利益高於一切！」「擁讓蔣主席領導和平建國！」「任何黨派不得擁有軍隊！」「要求國內統一，和平，民主！」「澈底執行停戰命令！」「雙方釋放政治犯！」「軍隊國家化，政治民主化！」「收回香港、九龍、澳門！」「撤換法國註滬總領事！」宏大的口號聲，在這裏響起了。</p>
<p>協商會議的各會員，這時正在國府禮堂及休息室中，舉行小組協商。學生代表，首先謁覓協商會秘書長雷震，提出他們的七項要求，並請各黨派代表講話。面對着這萬餘個純眞熱情的靑年，傾聽着這響澈雲霄的呼聲，沒有人不衷心感動，於是孫科先生首先致詞，在臨時裝置的擴音機前，他大聲的說：我敢向諸位同學堅次保証，政治協商會議幾天以內一定可以圓滿成功！對大家所呼的口統，表示完全讚成！羣衆發在一般的鼓掌歡呼，隨着孫院長的談話爆發了。接着，是周恩來致詞，他說大家的意見，中共也完全同意但在他說明內戰已經停止時，全場一齊大聲的喊：「沒有完全停止！」周氏跟着又向大家說明：現在，各黨各派，都在蔣主席領導之下，共同努力，使各種問題一定圓滿解次。陳啓天，張君勱，莫德惠，邵力子諸先生先後報告，一致讚同大家的要求，保証政治協商會議只許成功，不許失敗。</p>
<p>全塲熱淚縱橫</p>
<p>在大家再次要求無黨派代表講話時，莫德惠老先生，由一個人攙扶着，從國禮堂步下台階，他帶着東北間胞的眼淚和熱切的祝望，再次的來向大家講話·他說：這次從東北經過天津北平回來，老百姓要他向協商會議轉達，「他們再不能受戰禍了誰還要打，我就拿老命跟他拚！」老先生混身因激動而顫抖着，他的熱淚迸流，泣不成聲·中大吳校長哭了，全塲學生和擁擠在國府門外的羣衆都器了·記者站立在擴音機旁是用整個的生命在記錄着這動人的話語，傾聽着這位髮鬚斑白的老人悲傷顫抖的喘息，也不自覺的流淚了·是的，哭吧！透過眼淚去認識真理，能哭的人，才是懂得愛憎的人呵！在國府的廣塲，這一刹那，千萬人純眞的眼淚，與華北苦艱同胞的眼淚交流着！</p>
<p>莫德惠大呼籲</p>
<p>莫老先生又以極堅定熱情的聲音說：八年以前抗戰初起時，蔣主席曾對他說明過「抗戰到底」的決心，他以衰老之年，在主席的感召下苦鬥八年，現在，抗戰勝利了，今天，他願以自己的信念，向大家說明：蔣主席一完可以突破一切阻碍，使這個會成功的，如果這個會不成功，他要向蔣主席建議不要閉幕，他自己也就不離開這裏，不再回東北去·「年輕的老弟們呵！我們國家今後能吾在四強中丫得住，就靠協商會議能吾成功呀！」莫老先生的呼號，使全塲激動在呼，許久不停。</p>
<p>接着主席團宣佈遊行就要開始，辦事務的人員這時分發饅頭，大家席地咀嚼着帶來的乾饅頭，開水，未送到時，遊行的隊伍已開始出發。從國府——上淸寺——兩路口——七星崗——都邮街——薈坪街——中正路——凱旋路——林森路——和平路市區的老百姓，用更大的歡呼，迎接這光榮的隊伍。重慶的新聞記者們以及美國，財政顧問楊格，同業斯蒂爾等，都隨着奔走，在領事巷，英法大使館門前，大家更貼英文標語，喊英文口號，從使館裏走出來的人，他們瞠目的望着。這爲維護國家權益而呼喊的人羣。</p>
<p>五點鐘，遊行結束，萬餘純眞的靑年圓滿的寫完了這一首雄壯動人的史詩，愉快和興舊照耀着他們的歸途。</p>
<p>向同學們首先致詞的……</p>
<p>孫會員科</p>
<p>美國醫藥界發明血綿療傷術</p>
<p>美國私立實騐室製劑師，在一烘血液用之真空烘爐上，裝置溫度調節機。新製血綿，可供外科醫師應用，其法係將人類血液中血漿提出後，然後以血塊製成種產物，繼維蛋白質，乃血液中之一種蛋自質原素，一遇到空氣，遂使血液凝結，功能防止傷口過度流血，蛋白質泡沫在外科傷口上，可換成一種血塊，應用時覆於傷處，而聽其血液逐漸吸收。此種血綿，不僅可以在施用手術時防止流血過多，且可防止手術使用後大量出血之虞。</p>
<h3 id="c37">故羅斯福總統私人顧問　霍浦金生平追述 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>瞌逝了的美國一代智囊</p>
<p>霍浦金氏畫像</p>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>霍浦金氏於昨日逝世，惡耗傳來，不但使全美國民震悼，連聯合國軍民也要同聲一哭，因爲他是故羅斯福總統的學友，並協助其擊退漢西斯敵人的有力主持者。茲誌其略史如下：</p>
<p>家境清貧　馬具工人之子</p>
<p>霍浦金小時候家庭經濟，非常淸貧，父親是要阿華州，格林納爾地方的馬具製造工人，雖然霍浦金的家庭經濟很貧困，但在他父親的勉力主持下，他終算畢竟修完了大學的敎程，得法學博士學位。十十五歲開始從事社會事業，擔任紐約「貧民生少協進會』的調查員，深入到每一個貧民社會中，實地考察貧民生活，同時使他看到了下層社會的每個陰暗面。這對於他將來生活經騐的畏成，和事業的開展，是有着很大的帮助的。</p>
<p>初次大戰　投身紅會服務</p>
<p>一九一七年，美國捲入了第一次歐戰，霍浦金就投入紅十字會服務·擔任墨西哥灣的主任，埋頭於救護事業·一九二二年再回紐約，任「貧民生活協進會」副會長。後二年，被任爲紐的防癆協會秘書長。</p>
<p>他的與羅斯福相識，還是早在一九二八年美選舉總統之時，那時羅斯福任紐約洲洲長，羅氏爲爭取民衆信心計，就組織「臨時救濟委員會」計劃大規模救濟失業人員八十萬人。霍浦金在當時，就被任該會副會長。後一年，擢升爲正會長，全權負責紐約洲的大規模救濟事業·由於他辦事能力的幹練，從這時開始，他的政治地位，就逐漸升高而被人注意起來。</p>
<p>一九三三年，羅斯福當選爲總統。三四年一月，羅斯福任命他爲商務部長。雖然他對商務部的改革，有着綢密的計劃，但因那時他患着很嚴重的胃病，健康失常，許多時間都消耗於轉展各地的療養中。</p>
<p>霍氏於一九三九年起，任羅斯福私人顧問，經歷不景氣時代及戰爭時期，多所擘劃，羅氏倚爲心腹。在華盛頓，聲名並不十分顯署。戰爭期內，霍氏不僅爲總統顧問，兼任軍火委員會主席。</p>
<p>追隨羅氏　參加重大會議</p>
<p>曾先後參加卡羅勃朗加會議，奎貝克會議，開羅會議，德黑蘭會議及雅爾達會議。渠亦曾出席一九四一年八月著名之船上會議，大西洋憲章，即在該會議中草擬者，戰時曾代表羅斯福總統訪問倫敦四次。　德國進攻蘇聯後，羅斯福急派霍氏住見史太林，返美時，即向國會報告蘇聯決心作戰到底·一九三八年任商務部長，曾出席參議院證明其與羅斯福總統之關係稱：「于已受總統任命爲行政官，予向爲總統服務，且信任總統，參院如通過任命，予可預料其所通過者，乃專心爲總統及德統主張服務之人，予信任總統之主張，當然應忠於總統。」</p>
<p>才具優異　爲史太林賞識</p>
<p>史太林對霍氏較對聯合國其他人長，更爲賞識。去夏訪問蘇聯返歸後，其健康愈見惡劣，不久遂告退休。其後又接受紐約婦女衣服業主席之位，專管工資及其他勞工問題之仲裁事宜。</p>
<p>霍氏聖馬茜女士爲續弦，於一九四二年七月間，在白宮結婚，其前妻生有二子一女·子已在馬紹爾羣島作戰陣亡。</p>
<p>霍氏享年五十六歲。</p>
<h3 id="c38">嫏嬛之府·羣玉之山　海源閣舊藏本　現經北平圖書館保存 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>聊城楊氏海源閣廠書，近經宋院長在津決定以法幣一千五百萬元收購，歸爲國有，由北平圖書館關室保管。此項珍品，係於十五年前由張廷諤·莫毓麟等所組織之存海學社所受藏，存於天津鹽業銀行。藏園居士傳增湘於前數年瀏覽之後，曾有「海源閣藏書紀略」之作，對於現存珍籍，詳加說明。茲將原文節錄如左，以供海內關心者之參考。</p>
<p>自聊城楊氏海源閣藏書散出後，凡讀書好古之士，以及當代名公巨鄉，咸奔走告語，謀所以保存之策，或搜求於玻璃廠肆，或遠訪於　魯都會，或諮詢於楊氏後裔．</p>
<p>吾國近百年來，藏書大家以南翟北楊，幷稱雄于海內，以其收羅宏富，古書授受源流，咸有滯緒，若陸氏之　米樓，了氏八千卷樓，乃新造之邦，殊未足相提而幷論也。</p>
<p>自閣書散佚之耗出，於是廠估萍走四出，西至保定，順德，大名，東至福州，濟南，靑島，風起雲湧，竭力窮搜，萃積於平津各肆，而楊氏後裔，以旅居耗產，亦出所藏，以求善價·二三年來，其散出者，略已少半。余前歲客津門，曾觀宋本二集，凡廿六部，大率先後爲有力者分携以去·余以貲未得嘗鼎一　，其鈔校秘籍，出現於海王邨者，亦經官館私家，購求殆盡，往往二一鈔校小帙，而懸價千金，而宋元古刻，更夫論矣。說者遂謂宋存室中，精華殆已略盡，然以直賞者衡之，其事固朱必盡然也。考楊氏藏書，號稱美富，然其父子特自矜異者，獨爲四經四史，故於宋書室中，別題齋名，梅伯言撰海源閣記。以謂几書之次六藝諸子詩賦者皆流也，非其源也</p>

<p>編輯先生：昨閱貴報「共產黨在烟台之德政」一文，深爲感動。我等居住蘇北，所受痛苦，皆共產黨一手造成，且更有甚者。茲略述如下：共黨視人命若兒戲·例如東台季堡區區長盛傑者，平均每日殺人數名，又有指導員馬賓者，亦嗜好殺人。以上二公，平均半年被殺者總在三百人以上，故死於二公之手者，不知凡幾。凡住在其區域內，根本就談不到自由，只要能有全性命，即天大造化了，還有甚麽「民主」？靑年如不參加工作，或不參加入「黨」者，即說你是等待「老中央」，罪其名曰「國特」，即處以死刑，或拋入手中淹死，或活埋土中窒死，或丟火中燒死。彼等主義是「不爲我用，不留人用」。尤可笑者，無事則將靑年婦女，請至大會塲「坦白」私事，叫她說，「有姘頭幾位？何時幽會？……」一切要「坦白」報告，吾則羣起而攻之，加以侮辱，說你不「坦白」，就不配做共黨治下的人民。故靑年與婦女，相率逃至上海南通泰州等地，以待國軍下降，誠若大旱之望　霓也。在鹽阜一帶，又有所謂「聞香隊」者，某家飲食稍佳，如吃魚肉之類，被彼等嗅着，或突入掀鍋蓋看見，即認爲資本家享樂，立將財產充公，又有靈機姑娘（女偵探），侮十家派一位　機姑娘管理，可以穿房入戶，出入自由，調查十家情形。如言語稍有不符，即以「國特」名之，拘禁偵查，以至槍斃。其他如上海報紙法幣，皆禁止入境，吾則是認爲有特殊工作。最近有自江北來人云，現正抓伕入伍，將大批靑年集中，等待開發。故蘇北人民近來處於水深火熱之中，日夜仰望國軍開入，以解倒懸之急。以上種種，皆蘇北之實况。敬請貴報與以刋載，爲禧。蘇北一個旅由靑年。一，廿八。</p>

<p>編輯先生：國家抗戰八年，軍士浴血八年，後方的人民負重八年，倫陷區的人民壓榨八年，大家在艱苦之中渡着生活。日寇感受盟國的成脅而無條件投降了，蔣主席體恤淪陷區的人民，豁免田賦，减輕租稅，人民正在慶幸而感謝蔣主席的恩德，乃不久便有使人民哭笑不得的一件事兒降臨。我們中國歷來購辦軍米，總是由米商承辦的，可是這次也沿襲淪陷期間的辦法，向民間挨戶照田畝攤派，征取價格低賤，人民喫了這樣的虧，豈不要哭笑不得嗎？但是這種辦法。凡屬收復各省都是這樣呢？還是單單無錫一縣這樣？照現在市價，糙米每石須法幣八千多，而派價除去解費，僅可得法幣四千五百元。這樣的暗虧喫了，誰人知曉呢？甚至要解了米，纔能領款，手續麻煩，零星拆蝕很大，豈不寃哉！日寇强迫征集，儲糧豐富，大可利用，爲什麼毫無所得呢？無錫曹維治上。</p>
<p>先修班遲不開學</p>
<p>主筆先生：我謹以一片至誠的心，希望先生能在貴報賜以一角寳貴的園地，予以披載。說來眞是令人懊喪，我是一個高中的畢業生，恰巧在「敵僞」的統治下畢了業，那時因爲沒有去考「僞」國立大學，於是一直的被延擱下來，始終沒有進過大學的門。滿以爲勝利以後，必有較優的處置。誰知事實會給我們怎樣的不滿，恐怕主持正義的各界人仕們一定不會相信吧！抗戰勝利以後，主席爲了關懷收復區的失學靑年，在京滬等地設了一所臨時大學補習班，可是就因不是「僞大」學生而遭拒絕。幸而先修班隨之而設，再去一試，經過一場入學考試，終算「風平浪靜」「榜上有名」常時以爲可以不久開學上課，那知直到現在還是音悉杳無，而幾個考「僞大」的高中同學却都榮耀地在補習班上課了！主筆先生，這是不是勝利帶來了失望，而是敎育當局獎勵他們懲罰我們呢？再設，先修班的招生廣告上，明明有這樣的一條「……自開學日起至三十五年七月二十日止不放寒假修足一年學程……」怪冠冕十皇的詞句，到了現在，人家都在放寒假了，還是一個「開學日期另行通知，」試問這是不是不放寒假的預兆？我不愛看冠冕的措詞，不愛聽悅耳的敷衍，只求給予我一個迅速的處置，一個切切實實的處置，再不要布告儘管布告，事實還是事實，請各位先生們再不要輕視了它。也許這幾位大人先生們，在「等因奉此」「等由准此」中翻跟斗吧！還是患了嚴重的「健忘症」？人家又在招生又要開學又要上課了，而我們呢……？假使先修班當局認爲上課還須相當的時日的話不妨准我們領回證件，惟仍需保持學額，「讓我們去考別的大學，再不要忘記我們的證件是你「保管」着呀。我知這不少的同學一定在同樣的希望着它！韻，一月二十九日。</p>

<h3 id="c41">稱定幣值問題 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>日前美聯社華盛頓電訊，謂美京人士正密切注視中國貿易的發展。依據該社電訊消息，謂美國官商人土認爲及早恢復中美問的大規模貿易，目前不可過份樂觀，他們認爲即使中國獲致政治上的安定，經濟及法律方面的障礙仍復重重·美國官方人士認爲目今中國主要問題　爲具有「現實性」的外滙率的訂定。只有在這種外滙率頒定以後，才能開始有對華的貿易活動。但他們又認爲在確定此項滙率之前，中國政府將被迫發行一稱新幣制，故中國政府對新滙率的訂定必將考慮周詳。蓋布里敦的協定曾規定各簽的國若不得到此國際組織的同意，各國通貨的估値不得超過百分之十，而中國又爲此國際協定簽字國之一。如果新滙率的訂定將是不合實用的，則它不但不足以幫助中國對外貿易的復興，且將有害。此外，美國人士叉就我國新訂的公司法有所指陳，認爲外商公司須在外國有本店一節，將使中國招受不利，與歡迎外資的原意相背云云·這一段電訊中使我們特別應到興趣的，是關於我國的幣制問題。這的確不僅是有關我國對外貿易的復興，抑且有關我國整個民族經濟的榮枯，和社會秩序的安定·願於此際，略陳所見。</p>
<p>首先我們要聲明的，是一個國家經過長期戰爭以後，必然會引起通貨問題，及其有關的整理制幣問題。第一次世界大戰後的法國與德國如是，即英國美國亦相繼鬧着幣制的整理問題·英國的取消金本位，美元的貶値，雖不在戰後立刻發生，但其所以有問題，却與第一次世界大戰結着密切的因果關係。在第二次世界大戰，德意日的幣制有問題固不必說，法國亦有它嚴重的貨幣問題亦不多提，、即英美自身也有貨幣問題，特其問題不甚顯著，然通貨購買力之一般降低却是事實。我國抗戰最久，所受的財政創傷最重，因之，我們的通貨問題亦特別關得嚴重。這問題不因戰爭的終止而終止；在某一種意義下，戰爭的終止，却正是這問題的開頭·過去八年的抗戰，在稅源枯竭的財政狀况下作戰，我們不得不借重印刷機器，不斷製造新法幣來應付戰費及國家的支出，不是件如何可恥的事。這就是在英美，亦不能例外。不過在英美，自然管制得極好，所以沒有鬧成像我們這樣漸趨嚴重的問題。我們國民應該原諒政府在戰時不得不靠增加發行來應付國庫的這一番苦衷。但增加發行畢竟是一服毒藥，有點類乎飲鴆止渴·今日一切的問題，都可以牽涉到貨幣閒題上去，一切復興都談不上，如財政金融不謀善後復興！政府在戰時靠發行來維持國庫，我們做國民的應該原諒；但戰事終了近乎半年，政府自當速謀貨幣問題的解決，吾則問題如果轉趨嚴重，將何以對人民？</p>
<p>目今中國的幣制眞可謂混亂不堪。敵僞政府所發的僞幣固不必說，即就法定的貨幣而言，京滬江南，所謂華中收復區一帶的法幣成一系統，華北的成一系統，東北的又成一系統，此外，台灣又成一系統。如此系統龐雜，固爲一時應付受降所造成之不可避免的局勢，但此項局勢究不能任其久延。這需要迅速的整理。然此僅爲一外表問題；而問題的核心，却是如何求幣値的穩定。幣値若不能穩定，則一切幣制改革均將無法實施：而幣制若不改革，不特一切財政改革將無法諸實施，即國家的復興亦不能定上軌道。</p>
<p>外滙率的重訂，是否即可使貨幣的價値穩定下來，不無疑問。若果貨幣不能穩定，勢必影響於外滙的再重訂，這樣循環下去，將變成一種惡性循環，仍無補於實際問題的解決，甚且或使間題益趨於嚴重。美國人士所謂具有「現實性」的外滙率的訂定，所謂「現實性」究何所指，我們固不便妄加揣測。若依目前黑市滙率，使中國法幣穩定於一千五百元上下，雖不失爲一種一現實性」的決定，然於中國民族經濟的發展，顯爲有害，對於正在生長中的我國民族工業將無疑地成爲一種打擊。就目下的物價言，若干中國工業自製的製成品勢將無法與輸入品競爭。故關於「現實性」外滙率的訂定，不僅是一個貨幣問題，還固時是一個關稅問題，須於運用關稅政策之中，謀「現實性」外滙率的訂定。至於一時盛傳所謂外滙分級制的劃定，倘能適當運用關稅政策，而無絲毫的阻力，便無須如此繁複的措施，</p>
<p>穩定幣値原有兩方面的意義；一爲求國內幣値的穩定：一爲求對外幣値的穩定。前者雖多少決定於後者，而後者亦多少足以影響前者。我國當今的貨幣問題牽涉到的實在太多。在整理幣制的努力上，所需要的是沈毅果敢的精神，大刀闊斧的作風。已經病人膏盲了的金融幣制機體，是只有施用大手術才能有復甦之望。我國戰前的幣制原不健全，現在又百孔千瘡，澈底改革，此應其時。德國當第一次世界大戰後的整理馬克，俄國的整理盧布，應可爲我們的借鑒。目前滬市盛傳政府即將發行「孫」幣，旋雖經兪郁長否認，但我們盱衡目今局勢，新幣縱一時或不致發行，而爲解決我們的貨幣間題，若僅恃外滙率的重訂，或已不再可能。</p>
<p>總之，如何解次目前的貨幣問題，實爲政府當務之急。上海一市，收復到如今，將近四月，而物價却一直在上騰，這就表示幣値一直在下跌·我們不能將物價的騰漲歸咎到它種因素上去，須知這主要還是一個貨幣問題，社會的不安，人民生活的動盪，政府財政的困難，都由於這個問題的未曾得到合理的解次，政府應及早應付這個問題，作適當的處理，則一切其它問題，始可逐</p>
<p>爬裗，而使之漸入常軌。</p>

<p>電力公司工潮，於前日經吳局長開先親自調解，僵持局面，本可打開，乃至深夜，因勞方代表態度變更，致又發生變化，茲誌昨日吳局長調解經過如下。</p>
<p>吳開先氏懇切解釋</p>
<p>昨日上午十時。雙方人表繼續至社會局協商，所談益趨接近，關於勞方所提養老金一律百分之十之要求，經社會局數度折衝，公司代表已表示接受，雙方益見接近，勞方所爭持者，爲五臨時工人之復工與加薪之合理問題，下午五時後，吳局長於徵詢資方對於各項問題之意見後，復召集勞方代表歐陽祖潤等談話，陸特派員京士，王委員先靑，張科長振遠，暨五大公用事業工會代表皆在座，吳局長就勞方提出之十一項條件中、，尚需商討各點逐一加以解釋後就勞方所提五臨時工人之復工及本年度加薪之合理化問題，發表意見，略謂五臨時工人之解僱，資方提出契約作證，有充分理由，惟本人對於該五工友極爲同情，願予援助，除囑資方增發一月薪金作遣散費外，本人當盡力設法代爲介紹工作。加薪之合理化問題，勞資雙方前已商得同意，並提供各項資料，呈請市政府仲裁，本人當代爲催請市府，早日提付仲裁，以資迅速解決，並望明日先行復工，余當盡力爲諸君謀合理之解決，語畢，全座報以熱烈之掌聲。</p>
<p>勞力代表自願勸導</p>
<p>勞方代表歐陽祖潤并即表示幾顆返廠，勸導全體工友先行復工，吳局長當詢以是否需要社會局會同市黨部派代表同赴電力公司會同調勸，歐陽當答稱：本人當負責勸導全體工友先行復工，社會局暨市黨部可不必派代表問往，五大公用事業電話公司，自來水公司，法商電車公司，英商電車公司及煤氣公司等五代表，亦皆極度興奮，並願伴同勞方代表至該廠共同勸導全體職工先行復工。</p>
<p>態度突變　反對復工</p>
<p>據記者深夜探悉：電力公司代表歐陽祖潤離社會局時，忽堅拒五大公用事業公司代表同往電力公司調勸，歐陽等返抵電力公司後，亦未召集全體工人會議，僅舉行理監事會議，討論至十一時，卒因歐陽等堅決反對復工，致無結果，大多數工人，以舊歷年關在即，亟需返家，頗爲失望。</p>

<p>陳律師又起聲明二點：（一）森大　　購買水汀，由金宗城介紹，並當庭呈上金之名片，請傳其訊問。（二）僞上海地方法院曾答商統會函詢：五金鋼鐵其時并無限制移動之後明文。　李法又供稱，出賣水汀理由：（一）因恐爲日人沒收，故先出賣。（二）因本市常遭轟炸，電流時綴，爲裝置發電機，故出淸舊存水汀之地位。陳律師又特別提明二點：（一）出售水汀者其時絕非新新公司一家。（二）日籍顧問之聘用，有遠近兩因，近因爲應付當前局勢，遠因則在廿六年，當時日文每日新聞，大幅登載新新公司將以三萬元代價出盤與日人。嗣新新公司即登報駁覆，故日人進租界後，更非聘日人代爲應付不可。　傅訊原告　舒月橋等</p>
<p>庭上繼傅舒月橋，讒與李有無嫌怨？答稱：絕無個人恩怨，檢舉他全爲國民立塲。並聲明商統會之工作如何代敵人搜括物資，剝削人民，又言水汀由日軍用卡車載運而去，有多人目睹。繼傳韓武城，葉秋彬，姚桌人，供詞與舒月橋略同。其時商統會一欵暫告段落。爲確悉水汀鐵管之下落，乃傳新新公司前任庶務課長，及森大鐵廠韓志明，韓志　，傳積和，三人隨帶帳册到庭，翻閱詰問多時，雙方供詞相似。計水汀三百六十九祖七十斤半，每担僞幣五千六百元，共計二百零七萬三百四十八元。分三次付淸。</p>
<p>尙有證件下次提出</p>
<p>將退庭時，陳律師被告方面下次更有較多證件提出，不惟可護明其担任僞職係出被迫，且被告曾於本市淪陷期內，作有利抗戰之工作，（按李澤曾於舒月橋陳訴時，從袋中摸出兩函，交與陳律師。一係忠義救國軍袁某致李函，另一係某機關囑其於關軍光復上海時，多多接濟食用品。）庭諭希從速搜集證件，俟下次開庭時提出。李澤又欲發言，爲法官阻止，囑其可於下次一併陳述，即告這庭。</p>

<p>暑期前後復校</p>
<p>（一）凡遷往內地之專科以上各大學，一律力謀遷回各地復校，惟因路途與校舍及交通經費等關係，遷復之期間，致參差不齊，約在暑期前後，可告就緒。而各地方之中等學校，因戰時救濟，改由國辦，俟各地復員，當然仍歸各地方政府辦理。</p>

<p>推進國民教育</p>
<p>現在對收復區，亦督促推進。其內地已經照第一次計畫實施之省市，現自本年一月起，繼續作第二次五年計畫，　施行。其尚未推行者，如新收復之台灣，則作第一次之五年計畫，以便照行，以期達到各鄉鎭皆辦中心國民學校，各保皆辦國民學校，小學實施六年義務教育之目的。所謂戰後各級敎育之增進推行，除國民敎育，已由內地行之有紫，各收復區蕭規曹隨，並開快步，庶可並駕齊驅外，對於中等敎育，高等敎育，及社會敎育之整個分年推進實施計畫，亦將漸次釐訂。</p>

<h3 id="c87">一年之入場 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春」是一句很老的話，然而在每年的開始，總用着這一句話來警惕自己，策勵自己。</p>
<p>在一般家庭裏，在春節來臨的時候，都得忙得不亦樂乎。然而能在這時候，平心靜氣來討論一年的計劃的人，倒是很少的。其實一年的計劃的規定，却比應酬更爲重要。</p>
<p>春節是廢曆的正月的開始，照例我們已經改用國曆，不必再用廢曆，然而因爲農作的關係，我們尚有應用到廢曆的地方。因此在某種塲合，是被稱爲農曆的。</p>
<p>說起農曆，就使我們想着耕耘的事。我們要有聲盛的收穫，先要問問我們有沒有努力完成我們耕耘的工作，農夫們在春天裹要忙碌起來了。我們在家庭中的任何人，也應該在這個春天，定下我們的具體計劃。</p>
<p>我們不要但求一時的高興，一時的忙碌；我們要經常的高興，經常地忙碌。經常地努力。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3 id="c88">你的孩子頑皮嗎？ <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>提起孩子，做母親的常常會沒奈何地搖搖頭說：『我們家的那個，簡直沒辦法，整天的頑皮，只要你東西一放手，他就給你拆了，沒結沒完地蠻…打也打不好，駡更不用說了，好像是耳邊風。大人爲他氣死，他仍自顧自地又去蠻了」</p>
<p>是的，孩子是挺不聽話的，他們要頑要，不懂得礙不礙大人的事。握在手裏的東西，只要好玩，他不管你要緊不要緊，興趣來的時候，他只知道玩下去，不懂得這收「毀壞」，道樣的玩法，要引起大人的打駡。其實，孩子的媽媽，你們冷靜地觀察一下看，這是不是探索智識的一稱表示呀！</p>
<p>無疑地，孩子是少見孤聞的．任何東西在他們第一次看來，都是神聖而新奇的。他們想懂得，爲什麼會構成道樣的形質，他們要明白道個新穎的原素在什麽地方，於是他們探索這個疑問的方法，在大人們看來，往往以爲是一種「毀壞」。心理學家多數主張，譬如孩子能拆壞一隻錶，最好能再給他第二隻，別打呀駡的，阻止了他的好奇心。大家都承認，只有好奇心的催促，才能作進一步的瞭解，他的天才續能充分發揮，而孩子的天才表現，在頑皮的時候，更有無顧忌的流露。</p>
<p>小孩子不但愛頑皮，並且還愛多管間事，對於某一件事，某一樣東西，常常會發出莫明其妙的問話。可是做媽媽的，有時不層地給他一個不睬，或者天花亂墜地給他一個神怪而荒誕的答案，這一種漠澳無關的態度，對孩子是最最要不得的，尤其是對四五歲到十幾歲智識才開的兒童。</p>
<p>孩子不但需要懂，並且還必需懂得正確，讓他有一個基本的觀念。別以爲讓孩子進了學校，一切敎育的責任，都交給學校裹的先生了。老實說，書本裏讀到的，先生敎給他們的，不一定是他們最大的疑問，更不是他們最大的興趣。而他們最希望解答的，常常是一些大人們以爲層層碎碎的小事，或者是以爲莫明其妙的瞎話。譬如，他們問：天上有多少星呀？甘蔗是什麽做的？爲什麼熟天不下塲雪，做點冰淇淋吃吃？</p>
<p>他們的問話，是最渴望敎育的表示。你所回答的話，他們記得最牢，印象最深。如果你不耐煩或者不層地給他一個荒唐的解答，他們毫不懷疑地完全相信了。如果你回絕了他，或許他再也不會提起這一個問題。偶然的興趣一過，是不容易再回來的。至於嚴顏厲色地喝住他們的間話，那等於禁止他們求知。做爸爸媽媽的，對於孩子的問題，應該有一個正確而興趣的回答，順着他們的想像，重重地施些肥料。加肥料的目的，就是正確地發展他們的天才。</p>

<h3 id="c89">愉快的精神 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>我們要使家庭生活美滿愉快，就先要具備一種愉快的精神。這一種愉快的精神，可以由於準確的觀點和樂觀的態度而產生的。我們必須先具備這種準確的觀點，然後從近處按步就地做起，就可以使理想成爲事實，同時我們在面上也會顯露出笑容來。</p>
<p>有了愉快的精神，我們待人接物，就會有一種親切的感覺，不會有一種虛僞的尊嚴。使往何人見到了我們，好像是看見了最親暱的朋友一般。</p>
<p>由於道一種愉快的精神，就能够產生一種可貴的風度，以這種風度和人接觸，就可以達到「四海之內，皆兄弟也」的情形。</p>
<p>德國有幾個著名的哲學家：康德是一個猶豫不決的人物，叔本華是一個厭惡女性的獨身者，尼釆也是一個心理上的矛盾者，他們都沒有愉快的精神，因此他們的行動是乖戾的，他們的思想不能配合一般人的需要，他們也不能過正常的生活。</p>
<p>所以從現在起，讓我們產生一種愉快的精神，來做建設現代家庭的基本。</p>

<h3 id="c90">進病房的第一天 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 小床</p>
<p>考進了獲士學　，還得經過一個半月的試讀期。這一段時期，完全是授課，與醫院毫無接觸。就是我們的制服，亦單是一件藍布掛十，和白機，白鞋而已。這時期中，我們整天在地窖子的兩間大課室裏生活。一間課室中，滿是骨架，眼球，大耳朶等，玩具般的標本和模型，墻上掛的各種人體的圖表。這裏我們是聽講的。另一間是實習室，佈置和病房一樣，白的床，白的被單，白的櫃子，白的屛風，什麼都是白的，外加躺着兩個漆布製的病人，至少要比我們自己大兩號，因爲它們是從外國運來的，有黃的頭髮，和藍的眼睛。它們是用來實習的，如替它們洗臉，據　，喂飯，灌腸等等。一次我們在道裏上國文課，這位新來的老師，搖着頭小聲的念完了一首唐詩，輕輕的問道「會驚動他們嗎！」我們說，「不會的。」他「看，恍然大悟『哦，原來是外國人。」</p>
<p>六星期完了，我們還剩下三分之一的同學，有的因身體太差，有的功課趕不上，亦有少數因胆量太小而中途告退。第七星期的第一天早晨，我們換上了藍衫白裙的新制服，行過了嚴肅的加冕禮，由監督負分組帶進了不同的病房。我們的一組，共有四個人，病房是那樣的整潔，光亮，空氣嚴肅而安靜，祗有雜用室開門時的一陳自來水，蒸汽鍋和磁盆的碰擊聲。醫生和護士們穿梭似的忙碌工作，却非常鎭靜而有秩序。我們的四套新制服，今天成了他們注意的目標，病人亦睜眼注視，竊竊私語。特別是漿得挺硬的圍裙，走起路來，沙沙響得厲害，更拘束得令人寸步難移。也許是因爲到了陌生地方，病房總顯得太寬，太敞，在在都沒有可以隱身的地方。我們中有兩位是天性「活落」點，一下子就混入了舊隊伍，我與璪却戰戰兢兢的總黏在一塊兒。</p>
<p>紅燈亮了，意思說病人有請，我們對着一下，一塊兒向這病人跑去，誰亦不開口，病人說：「水沒有了。」她提了壺，我拿了盤，去到廚房門口，想起病人用的食具不可帶進廚房，兩人又退了回來，放下了壺和盤，到廚房裏找着了大水罐，一個提着，一個跟着。隔壁的病人叫「先生」。我們一齋回過頭去，他說枕頭不舒服，操抬起他的頭來，把枕頭稍稍往下一拉，我看見了勃子下的繃帶上有血蹟，就沒敢動手。操被監督員派去了，靠洋台的一個病人要大便，我去取了一隻便盆，蓋上一方布，自雜用室出發，相當有一程路。在衆目的注視下，不曉得該用雙手捧，還是一手提着的好？裙子擾亂地響得厲書，帽子亦像要掉，膝關節變硬，繼而發軟，我想暈。我又盡量的設法躲開醫生們，怕他們說的名詞我不懂，問我要的東西我不曉得。</p>
<p>好容易監督員來了，她帶我到一間單八病房，門口掛着紅牌，意思「隔離」，我立時屛住了氣，直等戴上了面具。她帮我穿上隔離衣，說這是傷寒病人，已入危篤時期，要我替他做量間護理。我躡手躡足過去，向他先打量了一翻，滿臉鬍子，兩眼深凹，雙眉緊鎖，枯瘦異常，微張着嘴，痰梗在喉頭，呼吸聲很粗。我把手錶除下，裹好紙，放在靠近的窗台上。一面工作，一面背記着不熟悉的工作程序，還得注意繁複的隔離手續，時常猶豫，時常忘懷。我慶幸這是個不大有知覺的病人，沒有什麽反應，正像課室裏的假人，祇是份量重點。我吃力的替他擦完澡，換上被單，廚房裏送來一碗鷄湯。我勉强銀了他兩匙，第三次，鷄湯由嘴角流出，他不再嚥了。我擦乾了他的嘴，將被單塞好。他睡得比前安靜，放開了眉沒有了痰聲</p>
<p>一個護士托着盤來替他洗眼睛，她沒有放下盤又出去了，接着進來一羣醫生和一架抽吸器，他們將皮管的一端塞進病人嘴裏，機器軋軋的轉動。一偭肥胖的外國醫生做了個停止的手勢，室中頓時寂然，靠床的一個年靑醫生抬起病人的臀部，一片血。他們低聲的不淸楚的說了些外國話出去了，我好像是聽得「出血」…「擦澡」…「學生』。走在最末的一個長子回過來瞪了我一眼</p>
<p>我呆立在房門不遠的地方，好像隔得很久很久，監督員才來了，地說「你要什麼？」她的聲音非常溫柔，幾乎使我流下淚來。「還有一隻錶。」「錶？」「在裏面，」我指着小房間。她明白了，微笑着跑了進去，很自在的在死人頭邊的窗台上取了我的錶。我被帶出了病房，在她辦公室裏喝了一杯熱咖嗎，「你下班吧，」她還是那樣溫柔的說，不懂，她說，「時間到了。」</p>
<p>我知道時間並沒有到，可是我急速的跑回宿舍一連洗了　　澡。這天晚上，我覺得混身發　，難堪。我看見一臉鬍子，一片血。我聽見「學生」…「擦澡」…「出血」……。</p>

<h3 id="c92">蘇聯的婦女 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 楊慧娟</p>
<p>美國平珍珠女士（Pearl　Binder），寓居俄國多年，對俄國婦女有很深的認識，著有關於俄國風土人情的書很多，俱受人稱頌，以下係她對俄國婦女生活方面詳盡之描寫。</p>
<p>俄國婦女的地位是和男子平等的，因爲她們的工作與生活，並不完全限於家庭中。前幾年，蘇聯雖因人口需要，極力鼓勵生育，但婦女的職務始終不曾拘囿於家庭中，婦女除了治家外，更要從事社會工作，擔任政府職務，參加各項工業，做音樂家，畫家，建築師，工程師等等。婦女任何事都參加，男子有甚麼事也都和婦女談，莫斯科盛行着列寗的一句名言，是：「每一個廚子，都要懂得怎樣統治俄國。」</p>
<p>婦女們在家庭有那麼多事，同時再要擔任外面的工作，這似乎是不可能的。而俄國婦女之所以能如此，也有幾個原因。第一是家中的事務，隨着科學進化而變得非常簡單，第二是社會的工作，因了安排得適當而弄得十分合理化。婦女在外面擔任工作，工作時間是很短的，事午有休息時間，午後祇做到四點鐘，每到第六天就有一天休息，家中即使事務多，也可以從容的去料理清了。</p>
<p>同時家務也很簡單：傢具祇極簡單的幾件，數分鐘內可以掃除淸爽；侮家有公共燃器，烹調十分便當；買菜有配好了的。不願燒菜的話，可以買現成的菜，用隻三層的鍋提回來，普通大家都是在公共的食堂內喫。孩子有託兒所照管，更不用大人一直去煩心。家務實在太忙的，可以請一務工，這種帮工稱爲『家務工作者』（Domestice　Worker），不穿制服，祇帶着一條圍裙。她們的敎育程度較差，所以一方面替你作事，一方面你也要盡義務敎她們書。</p>
<p>有人以爲像這樣社會化的家亭，孩子一定不能受到好好的照應，家庭中一定也會失去許多樂趣，實際上這種觀念並不大對。孩子由託兒所照料，並沒有甚麽流弊，因從事努力此項社會工作者，已有二十五年的歷史。家庭中因爲省去了許多繁重無謂的工作，婦女正可利用餘暇，去從事各種較有意義的娛樂修養。公共食堂的菜也很可口，而喫飯也並不是限定在食堂內喫的，普通一頓早餐總在自己家裏，還有下午的茶點，也是自己在家中預備。</p>
<p>就是婦女出外服務，也因人而異，並不是强迫的，誘導婦女爲公衆服務，也是量才設施，用的是漸導的方法。譬如，有的婦女不愛離開家庭，她喜歡烹調，烹調的手段很好，就可以讓她多燒些菜，敎她去公共食堂中服務；有的婦女不喜歡離開家，她情願照管孩子，她對孩子特別愛好，就可以讓她多照管幾個孩子，敎她到託兒所裏去工作。</p>
<p>還有人以爲婦女出外工作，要侵犯到男子的「領域」，要遭到男人惱恨的。但是在蘇聯，並沒有這現象。男人有充分的工作，充分的職業，供他們去做，不用祖心到生意會被婦女搶去。同時他們很能明瞭，社會還有許多工作，正需要婦女同他們合作。</p>
<p>蘇聯的婦女，可曾因爲在外面工作，而變得粗獷惡俗，失去女性的美呢？（的確有不少的人，談到婦女在外面工作，可能的會担心到這一點，）蘇聯的婦女照樣保持着女性的美，照樣保持着女人的風姿媚態，祗不過她們不把美容看作是女人唯一的任務罷了。蘇聯婦女的生活是廣泛的，是活躍的，因爲她們的生活不祇拘限在家庭中。</p>
<h3 id="c93">家庭的真義 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>家庭是一個以情感組成的集團，在那裏，雙親相愛，並愛其子女，而及於家庭中的每一個份子；同時發揚光大眞正的情愛，使幼小者獲得保障和指導。</p>
<p>在家庭中，我們可以享受安靜的和生活，獲得安愉之感，，可以自身或和別人作正當的消遣；可以保藏我們私產，可以處置得合於我們各人的風度；而養成一切優美的習慣，言語，品性，遺傳給我們的子女。在家庭中，並能够，產生人類的互愛，忠誠，誠實，和其他良好的性格。</p>
<p>所以家庭實在可以說是一個天堂，一個聖地，和一個啓發我們的靈感的源泉。</p>

<p>上期曾講小哈巴狗的製法，今天再介紹怎樣製半截小布人袋。</p>
<p>半截小布人袋，和我們以前看見的那種裝喜果的小布人相似。不但可裝糖果，也可以做裝飾，給小孩子玩。用剩下的零碎料子，就可以做。</p>
<p>半截小布人袋的製　　　　，依左圖，將布塊尺寸大小　　，照綫點先將身體與身底龍合　來，成一圓筒形，後面開口，中間做空心的，再將臉面（用白布）照綫點縫合，內裝棉花（臉面露出的一方宜平整），將下端縫紥，再將帽縫戴頭上，與身體聯和縫緊（披肩及身體做夾層），兩臂亦縫合，裝人棉花，然後安置如圖（左下）繪上險面，頸間緊上絲帶，展後於帽端繫一絲繩，即可掛於梳妝檯畔，或小牀上，內可裝棉花紗布糖果等等，比一個普通的口袋好看得多。</p>
<p>假使有花邊，在小布人的衣服四週鑲上點邊，那更美麗了。</p>
<h3 id="c95">婆媳歌 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<p>我覺得：流行在中國社會間的歌謠，是有着不可磨滅的價値的。像下列一則，便十足的暴露出中國舊式家庭的不合理，而有加以改造的必要呢？</p>
<p>「薔薇花，月月開，婆駡媳婦死奴才。好吃好着挨不到，要打要駡不時來。奴不是前門跑進來，後門溜進來。自家央媒討我來，自家央媒討我來。四人抬頂花花轎，掮旗打傘倫放大砲。大哥抱上轎，小哥送到城隍廟。今日多冷淡，當時多熱鬧！』</p>
<p>在這首歌謠裏，便可以看出中國家庭中，婆媳之問不和陸的情形。我們固然不能說，一般家庭中婆媳間的情感，都是勢如水火的；但大多數的家庭中，婆媳間却隨時有發生衝突的可能。</p>
<p>怎樣使婆媳之間，减少磨擦，維持情感？只有從「互相諒解』入手。雙方都能「互相原諒」，那末，自然不會相互的吹毛求疵」，以至「反唇相議」了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Concerned About Price Fluctuations in Nanjing and Shanghai, Orders Swift Restoration of Land and Water Transportation, Emphasizes Balanced Adjustment of Finance, Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Chongqing News: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has expressed deep concern regarding the recent price fluctuations in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other regions. He has issued a personal order to the Executive Yuan and relevant authorities to expedite the completion of the following three tasks: (1) To exert the utmost effort to restore railway transportation, and to strengthen highway transportation and shipping. (2) After the restoration of transportation, to assist factories in the recovered areas to resume operations in sequence within one month at the latest. (3) Regarding the adjustment of finance in the recovered areas, equal emphasis should be placed on industry, agriculture, and commerce. Agricultural loans in the recovered areas should be processed in a timely manner, with the aim of increasing production daily, reducing unemployment daily, ensuring the smooth flow of goods, and preventing any delay in agricultural affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] After arriving in Nanjing, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun today met with more than ten people, including Chen Liudong, Special Commissioner for Finance and Banking, Li Jialong, Manager of the Central Bank, and Jiang Shuge, Director of the Taxation Bureau. He forcefully refuted the widespread rumors that the government would issue Sun Yat-sen banknotes, deeming it absurd. (Please refer to the Business News on page five.) It is reported that Minister Yu's trip will lead to important decisions regarding the reform of taxation, private operation of salt, and the exchange of counterfeit currency. Furthermore, Mr. Yu, after meeting with reporters from this newspaper, stated that foreign exchange, after being approved, would be announced soon. When asked whether the official gold price would be changed immediately, he replied that this had not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Concrete measures for the nationwide opening of salt sales to private operation have been decided by relevant authorities and will be announced after the Spring Festival. Additionally, the Ministry of Communications has made important decisions regarding opening up highways and encouraging private operation, with particular emphasis on commercial transportation on the northwest and southwest routes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The deadline for exchanging counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes is approaching, and the number of counterfeit notes circulating in various regions remains high. Furthermore, banks in various regions have not yet fully resumed operations, and exchange agencies are not widely distributed, making it difficult for people to apply for exchanges. Considering the rights and interests of the people and to facilitate their exchange, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Central Bank to increase the number of entrusted exchange banks and firms as much as possible within a feasible scope, and has notified each entrusted exchange bank and firm to appropriately relax restrictions on the number of people and the amount of money to be exchanged, in order to make it more widespread. It has also been stipulated that in cases where there are no designated responsible exchange banks or firms, or where there are exchange banks or firms but the number is too small to meet the needs, the county chamber of commerce may organize an exchange committee to be responsible for the exchange in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Central Bank. The above measures have been telegraphed to the relevant provincial governments, instructing the county governments to comply.</p>

It is understood that this order is based on the agreement that no troops from either side may enter Yi Feng after midnight on the 20th. The local security team is a unit under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, so it was ordered to withdraw.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] It is reported that the Kuomintang and Communist forces in Xuzhou reached an agreement on the 28th of this month to cease conflict. News from the Northeast states that three regiments of the Eighth Route Army have entered Chifeng, but this has not yet been confirmed. According to a telephone report received by the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters from Colonel Dutilrode, the U.S. representative, Chifeng is currently guarded by a security team, and both the Kuomintang and Communist forces are outside the city. Although there have been minor conflicts among the local troops, the situation has not escalated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch] A press conference for foreign journalists was held at 3:00 PM today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Liu Cuo, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun. The following is a record of the main questions and answers: Question: What is the current situation regarding the cessation of conflicts in various regions? Answer: Generally speaking, conflicts in various regions have ceased one after another. In a small number of areas where conflicts are still ongoing, the Executive Investigation Team will investigate the truth and carry out its mission.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] According to a responsible official of the Ministry of Communications here, 500 kilometers of railways in North China have been destroyed in the past four months, and it will take at least three months to fully repair them. The five major railway lines in North China, namely the Pinghan, Pingsui, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Jinpu railways, have all been damaged. The sleepers are completely gone. The rails are relatively intact because they are too heavy to move easily. It is said that the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan and Jinpu railways is still in good condition, but most of the small bridges have been severely damaged. At present, China has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply railway materials. Before the arrival of the materials, wooden bridges will be built to temporarily replace the iron bridges for temporary use. The Chinese railway authorities have notified the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the materials needed to repair the railways. Currently, China cannot manufacture locomotives, sleepers, and rails, so foreign assistance is urgently needed. According to reliable sources here today, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is currently sending 300 civil engineers to China to assist in the restoration of railway work.</p>

The transfer of Sun Liangcheng's troops to northern Anhui is one example of this. It is reported that the authorities will in the future deal with puppet troop officers by having them study after assessment, while soldiers will be demobilized and returned to farming.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 30th Dispatch] The Yunnan Public Association of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association recently received a telegram from the Chongqing General Association stating that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year, and it has been decided to invite all representatives to convene a preparatory meeting in Nanjing on April 4th to discuss everything. Representatives from various provinces and cities should arrive in the capital before April 3rd. After receiving this telegram, the Yunnan branch has notified the National Assembly representatives in Yunnan to prepare to attend the meeting on schedule. Furthermore, Su Ting, a member of the Political Consultative Conference's Military Inspection Group and a Senator, flew from Chongqing to Kunming on the 25th for a visit. According to him, he hopes that the Military Inspection Group will not set out because "we are all one family, why bother rehashing old accounts?" However, facts have proven that the group still needs to start work immediately, so it is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on February 1st to prepare for departure.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch] The National Assembly Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference held a meeting on the afternoon of the 30th but failed to reach an agreement.

<h3 id="e9">Soviet Troops Are Withdrawing from the Northeast, The Substantive Takeover by Provincial and Municipal Governments Awaits Development <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] Sources with good information provided our reporter with news that awaits verification, namely that Soviet troops in China may take parallel action with U.S. troops in China. The deadline for the Soviet troops to withdraw completely from the Northeast on March 1st (or at the latest February 3rd) is approaching rapidly, and as of now, except for the Soviet troops in Chifeng who withdrew on the 23rd, there is no sign of the Soviet troops in the Northeast withdrawing on schedule. It is understood that the Soviet army originally notified the Chinese authorities that Chifeng, Chengde, and Duolun would withdraw by the 20th, and the railway along the Changchun line would begin to withdraw on the 15th, withdrawing completely by February 1st. According to the Soviet side, the reason for the delay in the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in the Northeast is due to a lack of train fuel. Regarding Changchun and Shenyang, it is not that the National Army cannot take over, but because the National Army's strength is still weak, so the Soviets are still responsible. Madam Chiang's trip to the Northeast was hasty, with the official explanation being that the four-day round trip was a planned schedule, but some also said that it was due to the climate in Changchun being too cold. Shen Yi is still in Changchun, and after most of the municipal personnel arrive, he will go to Dalian. An Dong's Chairman Gao Xibing may spend the old year in the former capital. Director Xiong Shihui came to Beiping because he had been in the front for too long and returned to Beiping to connect with the rear, and will return to Jinzhou soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] The situation in the nine northeastern provinces under the snow and wind of early February, which has been awaited for a long time by Chinese and foreigners alike, will be no different from before this period. Although the Soviet side is about to withdraw its troops, the difficulties with fuel and vehicles will allow them enough time to take a few more looks at the changes in the overall situation in China. Although the National Government has already had seven or eight provincial chairmen and mayors take office, the takeover is still substantively stuck at the symbolic stage. Mayor Zhi Wenqi of Shenyang is still a traveler in the Taihe Hotel, and many chairmen, who are not much different from him, probably haven't kicked out the "first three kicks" yet. The climate in the Northeast is too cold. Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming both fell ill one after another because they couldn't stand it. Even the old youth Zhang Jia'ao, who has been busy all his life, has had headaches in Changchun every day. Sun Jinqi, who developed the Yumen oil field in the northwest winds and sands, just returned from Changchun today. He seems to have also been infected with the disease. He looks dispirited and says that he is not prepared to go to the Northeast. His job is to be the commissioner responsible for taking over the industrial and mining industries in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] The situation in the Northeast is difficult to clarify in the short term. The Northeast Headquarters will still temporarily move to Jinzhou, a remote corner. After returning to Beiping, Director Xiong has begun to prepare for this matter and will send one responsible person from each of the eight major departments to make arrangements within the next few days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] It was learned today from a senior official of the Northeast Headquarters that the work of withdrawing Soviet troops from the various garrison areas in the Northeast is in full swing, but due to poor weather conditions and lack of transportation and fuel, the takeover work of the National Army has been affected. Therefore, the withdrawal of Soviet troops may not be completed according to the planned schedule.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirtieth] In the case of the students of the Nanjing Provisional University's preparatory class injuring the head of the class, Wang Shulin, fourteen leading students, and the local court's procuratorate detained and investigated Bai Qing and eight others. They were prosecuted for interfering with association affairs and obstructing freedom. The criminal court of the court held a public investigation hearing at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The judge questioned each defendant one by one, and the defendants' lawyers requested that each defendant be released on bail and the detention be stopped. After the judge retired from the court, he ruled in writing that each defendant was granted bail. At that time, thousands of students from Nanjing and the students from Shanghai's Provisional University in Nanjing gathered in the court square to wait for news of the trial, and the order was quite good.

<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, accompanied by his daughter, Ganalian, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 30th) and is scheduled to fly to Japan this morning and return to the United States. General Wedemeyer did not announce the reason for General Harriman's return to the United States this time when he received reporters.</p>
<p>Also, General Eichelberger, Commander of the Eighth U.S. Army in Japan, his Chief of Staff, Major General Churchill, and Major General Keissling, Chief of the Engineering Division of General MacArthur's Headquarters, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 30th) at noon and will go to Tokyo with Ambassador Harriman this morning (the 31st).</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Yesterday morning, General Wedemeyer received local reporters at the Construction Building and spoke freely for an hour, answering questions from the reporters:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the transfer or sale of U.S. ships to China, the Chinese and American governments are negotiating. There are currently no ships being transferred or sold. However, during the transition period, Mr. Wedemeyer is authorized to dispose of the six Liberty ships under his jurisdiction. The use of these six ships will follow the will of Generalissimo Chiang, to transport troops and evacuate Japanese residents.</p>
<p>(2) The ceasefire order is progressing smoothly. Although there are sporadic battles, the overall situation is good. Mr. Wedemeyer had not heard about the rumored train from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao being robbed and shot at near Tangshan.</p>
<p>(3) The content of the conversation between Special Envoy Marshall and Mr. Wedemeyer when he came to Shanghai was mainly how to enable the U.S. military under Mr. Wedemeyer's command to assist the Executive Headquarters in its work, especially in transportation and radio communications. A radio station has now been established in Beiping to command and connect small teams sent to various places. In addition, the demobilization of the U.S. military in the China Theater was also mentioned. Those with sufficient points should be sent back to their country, while some should remain to perform their tasks. Mr. Wedemeyer denied advising Marshal Marshall not to go to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>(4) The U.S. military has never directly transported the New Sixth Army to the Northeast, but only transported the National Army to Qinhuangdao and Huludao by water. There were no American personnel or transportation equipment involved in going deeper. The U.S. military has never airlifted the National Army to the Northeast. Regarding the request of U.S. reporters to go to the Northeast for interviews, he has telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to request this, but there has been no response.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the evacuation of Japanese residents, it has been intensified since President Truman announced his policy last year. Only 30,000 people were evacuated in December last year, but currently 300,000 people have been evacuated (including those to Taiwan).</p>
<p>(6) MacArthur ordered that the U.S. military should assist the Chinese government in accepting the surrender before the Chinese troops arrive and then hand over the Japanese prisoners and weapons to the Chinese government. As for the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and residents, the U.S. military's task is only to assist and supervise. The actual work is the responsibility of China.</p>
<p>Because the traffic situation in Shanghai is quite chaotic, Mr. Wedemeyer plans to visit Mayor Qian to discuss remedial measures. The reporters present offered many suggestions, which Mr. Wedemeyer accepted.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Madame Chiang's Visit to Changchun <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Dispatch from Our Changchun Correspondent)</p>
<p>Changchun is now in the depths of winter, but the end of winter will bring spring. Although Changchun is named "Everlasting Spring," its people, like those everywhere, feel suffocated by the harsh winter and eagerly await the spring.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's visit to Changchun represents the Central Government, Chairman Chiang, and compatriots from within the passes, extending condolences to the Northeastern compatriots who have suffered under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism for a full fourteen years. She brought a warm heart, and in Changchun, she radiated this warmth to the nine provinces of the Northeast, warming the hearts of forty million people. Although the season has not yet entered spring, the people of the Northeast, especially in Changchun, seem to feel that the spring they have been waiting for has arrived.</p>
<p>It has been more than five months since the Northeast was liberated from the Japanese iron heel. The long torment of fourteen years was certainly unbearable, but in the past five months, unrest caused by scattered troops and bandits in various places has deprived them of the relative stability they had managed to maintain during those difficult years. They are certainly excited about the victory won by the country's eight-year war of resistance! But after the victory, when they look around at their actual lives, they can't help but feel a sense of disappointment, as if it were a dream. "Are the people of the Northeast destined to suffer hardship?" They ask themselves, feeling lost.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's arrival brought a sense of calm amidst the confusion. Forty million lonely and helpless hearts, warmed by the fervent heart Madame Chiang brought, are now closely united, breaking through the Great Wall; there is no longer a distinction between within and beyond the pass. The descendants of the Yellow Emperor are originally one family, and the pain of one family is felt by all. People in warmer places should also take responsibility for the desolation here.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang arrived in Changchun at two o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd. Zhang Jia'ao, Chiang Ching-kuo, Dong Yanping, and women representatives from Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun, Songjiang, and Jilin had been waiting at the airport for half an hour before the "Meiling" aircraft landed. A representative of Soviet Marshal Malinovsky was also present to greet her. Noteworthy at the airport were the conversations between Chiang Ching-kuo and Zhang Jia'ao with Soviet officers. While the honor guard and band were certainly targets, little Jia Jinsheng, only eleven years old, holding a bouquet of flowers and preparing to give them to Madame Chiang, was the focus of the reporters' cameras.</p>
<p>Jia Jinsheng is a remarkably intelligent and pitiful little girl. She is currently in the third grade of elementary school. She has three siblings; she is the oldest, and the other two are younger brothers, the youngest of whom is only four years old. Her father, Jia Guilin, was killed by the Japanese on May 1, 1944, at the age of thirty-five, for engaging in underground work, leaving behind a wife and four children. In recent years, the orphans and widow have been supported by colleagues. When asked by reporters, she said, "When my father died, my mother and I were living at my grandmother's house in Jinzhou. We rushed here after receiving the news, but my father was already dead. Now, my mother is often sick at home."</p>
<p>When Madame Chiang's plane arrived in the airspace above the airport, the welcoming party lined up along the runway. At exactly two o'clock, the plane touched down amidst the sound of military music. Chiang Ching-kuo boarded the plane and helped Madame Chiang down. After introductions to the welcoming party and the presentation of flowers, the representative of Soviet Marshal Ma gave a speech. Afterwards, she reviewed the honor guard and left the airport by car. In that instant, the sound of cameras from Chinese and foreign reporters, though amidst the music, could still be clearly heard.</p>
<p>The car drove onto the main street, where it was met by citizens welcoming Madame Chiang. Two long lines of people stood on either side of the road. Madame Chiang got out of the car and walked a short distance, smiling and nodding to them as a greeting. The citizens, numbering over ten thousand, had been waiting by the roadside for a long time. Upon seeing Madame Chiang, they cheered loudly, as if they wanted to pour out all the pent-up depression, anger, and sorrow they had accumulated in their hearts for many years. Even as Madame Chiang's car drove far down the street, the cheers still resounded in their ears.</p>
<p>Security forces and Soviet guards were stationed along the street, standing upright with guns every few meters. The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet armies was concretely demonstrated at this moment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Madame Chiang left Changchun again today. Her stay in Changchun, lasting less than three days, felt far too short. However, Madame Chiang told the women representatives that in the few days since she left Chongqing, Chairman Chiang had telegraphed her three times, urging her to return to Chongqing, where she also had many matters to attend to. She deeply regretted not being able to visit Shenyang, Harbin, and other places to extend her condolences, but in the near future, Chairman Chiang and she would return to the Northeast.</p>
<p>How the people of the Northeast admire Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang! Not to mention anything else, given the inconvenience of transportation, women representatives from as far away as Qiqihar and other places came to Changchun early to welcome her. They all longed to see Madame Chiang and to fully recount to her, the leader of the national recovery, their tragic experiences of the past years, so that their future fate might be given a chance to be remade. Furthermore, at the exhibition of photographs of Chairman Chiang and his wife's life, which began on the 18th and lasted for six days, the number of visitors was endless. The No. 1 Jinghua Elementary School, which had been deserted for a long time, was lively for a time in the snowy Northeast. On the streets, when the shops heard that Madame Chiang was coming to Changchun, many hung out banners at their doors saying "Welcome Madame Chiang's Arrival." Especially along the main street, several larger shopping malls made them even more elaborate and beautiful.</p>
<p>The people of the Northeast eagerly anticipated Madame Chiang's arrival before she came, warmly welcomed her when she came, and felt that her stay was too short when she left. However, the warm heart that Madame Chiang brought remained in Changchun and would be radiated from Changchun to the nine provinces of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang arrived in Changchun at two o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd and left at eight o'clock in the morning on the 25th, spending less than seventy hours in Changchun. On the morning of the 23rd, she inspected the urban area. Although the buildings in the government and company district established by the Japanese to exploit the Northeastern compatriots were all substantial structures, she only passed by them in a cursory manner. In contrast, the more crowded, low, simple, dilapidated, and run-down the residential areas were, the more intently she gazed at them. Therefore, when she spoke at the civic assembly at noon on the 24th, she said that she had seen the poverty of the Northeastern people, who were in urgent need of relief under the ruthless oppression of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, she decided to launch a fundraising campaign after returning to Chongqing and ordered the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to transport materials to effectively and universally solve the poverty of the Northeastern people. Indeed, the once wealthy Northeast has now changed its appearance. Although the Japanese exploited it enough, it was all a spring dream that vanished into nothing.</p>
<p>At the tea party and award ceremony held by the headquarters in the afternoon of the 23rd, Madame Chiang, on behalf of the Chairman, presented medals to the Soviet allies who helped us recover the Northeast. Marshal Malinovsky had returned home to run for election and was not in Changchun. The person who gave a speech on his behalf expressed special respect. At this tea party, Zhang Jia'ao explained the significance of the labor union's visit to Changchun. The rain clouds that seemed to exist over the Northeast, the people's doubts about the government, and the friendship between China and the Soviet Union would all disappear due to Madame Chiang's arrival. On the same day, Madame Chiang also visited the hospital to comfort the families of the fallen underground workers.</p>
<p>On the 24th, Madame Chiang not only visited the Soviet headquarters, attended the civic assembly and the tea party for representatives from all walks of life, but also visited the orphanage. In the evening, she also attended the banquet held by the Soviet army at the former Kwantung Army headquarters.</p>
<p>During the visit to the Soviet headquarters, she asked the soldiers about their experiences, the firepower of their guns, and their shooting methods. She also asked them what they ate for lunch, opened the pot lid, looked at the steaming meat soup, and inquired for a long time. The beds in the bedrooms seemed too narrow to accommodate a person's body, and she asked if so many people could squeeze in. She also ate a meal here, keeping several white-clad maids busy for a while.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's speech at the civic assembly deeply moved the audience. When speaking about the suffering of the Northeast, Madame Chiang showed infinite sympathy on her face, and her eyes were moist, which left an unforgettable mark on the hearts of the Northeastern people who had been slaughtered for fourteen years. Here, worker Zhao Kuiwu spoke on behalf of the citizens, expressing his hopes for the Northeast and the country in excitement and joy.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Soviet army hosted a banquet for Madame Chiang at the former Kwantung Army headquarters. The magnificent and luxurious Kwantung Army headquarters had the heating turned up high, making people feel as if it were spring. Many maids, exposing their snow-white arms, were busy running around like shuttles, making people never feel that this was a banquet in a military camp. One maid, leaning against the wall, even took off her shoes, and only a layer of flesh-colored stockings was sliding on the thick carpet. Chinese and Soviet national flags were hung on all four walls of the dining room, and extremely large portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Lenin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshal Stalin were hung on both sides of the restaurant. There were about a hundred Chinese and Soviet guests in total, with almost every two Chinese people accompanied by an ally, either a man or a woman. Toasts were raised to the friendship between the two countries, to the heads of state of the two countries, and to Madame Chiang. Vodka, brandy, and beer filled the tables, and they were drunk cup by cup. The allies' hearty drinking was truly admirable. Madame Chiang's speech during the banquet earned enthusiastic applause with every sentence, and the applause was accompanied by military music, making the applause even more thunderous. Chairman Trotsenko specifically stated that the foundation of friendship between the two countries should be built on economic and cultural cooperation. Madame Chiang severely criticized the cooperation that the Japanese Nazi fascist imperialism had talked about with our country in the past. She believed that the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union was based on understanding, so it could achieve true cooperation.</p>
<p>After the banquet, they watched a movie in another hall similar to a cinema, showing a victorious parade and sports games on the Red Square. In the second film, Chiang Ching-kuo appeared on the screen twice.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chiang Ching-kuo, from the time Madame Chiang came to Changchun until she left, he was the busiest person in those less than seventy hours. He translated both Chinese and Soviet languages, so every time there was a gathering of Chinese and Soviet people, he was probably the most stressed. (Fang Ren, January 25)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Security Council Allows Iran and Soviet Union to Negotiate Directly to Resolve Disputes Until a Fair and Satisfactory Result is Achieved. <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a broadcast from London on the 30th, the Security Council met this afternoon. The Iranian representative stated that the Soviet representative's claim that Iran and the Soviet Union were actually engaged in direct negotiations was not accurate. The Iranian side had twice expressed its willingness to send a representative to Moscow, but it was rejected. The exchange of notes between the two countries cannot be regarded as direct negotiations. At this point, the Iranian representative paused for a few seconds and said in a low voice, "The Security Council must not give up dealing with Iran's complaint. However, at the last meeting, the Soviet Union proposed that the two sides negotiate directly. If the Security Council believes that Iran should indeed negotiate directly, then Iran will obey. However, all negotiations will be conducted under the supervision of the Security Council. Iran does not want the Security Council to abandon dealing with this complaint." At this point, Soviet representative Vyshinsky stood up and declared that the Soviet Union was very pleased that Iran was willing to negotiate directly. However, with regard to the Iranian proposal that the negotiations should be conducted under the supervision of the Security Council, I have something to say. If Iran is genuinely willing to seek security, not just verbally, then the only way is through negotiations between the two sides, not under the management of the Security Council. From the Soviet government's point of view, the exchange of notes between the two countries last year did not go through a third party, so it can be regarded as direct negotiations. The events in northern Iran were not caused by the pressure of the Soviet army, but by the genuine expression of the people of Azerbaijan." Subsequently, U.S. representative Stettinius proposed a compromise solution, which was supported by the representatives of China, France, and Poland. Stettinius suggested waiting for direct negotiations between the two sides, but the Security Council should be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations at any time, until a fair and satisfactory solution is achieved.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 30th] The United Nations Security Council continued to discuss the Soviet-Iranian dispute today. It is speculated that there may be a compromise solution. The Security Council may allow the two countries to negotiate directly, but must report the progress of the negotiations to the Security Council. Iran's new Prime Minister Sadar sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Attlee today, reaffirming the friendly relations between Britain and Iran, stating that "I believe that Britain will help the Iranian people fulfill their just and legitimate aspirations."</p>
<h3 id="e18">Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie Accepts Appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Oslo, 30th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie has accepted the invitation of the Security Council to serve as Secretary-General of the United Nations. He left here by plane for London at 9:30 this morning. The United Nations General Assembly may formally approve Lie's appointment at a meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 29th Special Telegram] The problem of advancing the candidate for Secretary-General of the United Nations among the five great powers has finally been resolved satisfactorily. The Security Council held a closed meeting tonight, and all eleven member states agreed to nominate Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie to serve in the highest administrative position of the United Nations. Security Council Chairman Mejinye immediately telegraphed Oslo to seek his consent, thereby opening up the stalemate on this issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 30th] The Security Council's unanimous recommendation of Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as the first Secretary-General of the United Nations pleased representatives and observers in Westminster. Lie is generally recognized as the most suitable candidate. In addition to his personal integrity, there are two points that are generally felt to be gratifying: (1) It is recognized that this resolution was agreed upon by the five great powers in a closed meeting, which shows that the permanent members of the Security Council will no longer allow organizational issues to evolve into a divisive situation. (2) Since the site of the United Nations has been established in the United States, it is more balanced to have a European serve as Secretary-General. After Lie is elected, his political authority will be far greater than that of the Secretary-General of the old League of Nations. He can raise any event that threatens world peace and security to the Security Council, and the two thousand staff members of the United Nations will also be under his control. After taking office, Lie must first appoint staff, carefully selecting from the fifty-one countries. Those selected should swear to give up their original positions and serve the United Nations wholeheartedly, subject to the Secretary-General's deployment. Lie must also prepare the United Nations' budget and manage its income and expenditure. He may also serve as an intermediary or advisor for various governments. The Secretary-General's annual salary is nine thousand pounds. He can obtain free housing. He and the Assistant Secretary-General and their wives and children all enjoy diplomatic privileges.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Brief Biography of UN Secretary General Trygve Lie: Humble origins, a genius for diplomacy. <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, 9th] Norway's foreign minister, Trygve Lie, elected Secretary-General of the United Nations, comes from humble origins. He is fifty years old, the son of a carpenter, with a burly figure and heroic appearance. He is a lawyer specializing in labor law with a natural talent for negotiation. When Lie became Norway's foreign minister in 1941, he had no international diplomatic background, but his life's work shows his passionate interest in Norwegian politics and labor law. Norwegians all know that he has the ability to resolve difficulties and bring the two sides to a compromise. In his spare time, Lie spends most of his time skiing and playing tennis. Lie, whose full name is Trygve Halvdan Lie, was born in Oslo. After graduating from the law department of Oslo University in 1919, he served as the secretary-general of the Norwegian Labor Party. In 1922, he became the legal advisor to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. By 1939, he was the Minister of Commerce and Shipping. In 1940, when the German army invaded, Lie was one of the last officials to leave Oslo.</p>
<h3 id="e20">The First Session of the United Nations General Assembly May End on the Tenth of Next Month: The General Committee is Intensifying its Work <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 30th] The United Nations is now planning to conclude its meeting in London on February 10. Many of the secretaries of the United Nations agencies are suffering from colds, so the General Assembly has had to announce a recess for tomorrow, and the next plenary meeting has been postponed to Friday. However, at the General Committee meeting last night, it was estimated that a conclusion could be reached by February 10. The General Committee, which decides the affairs of the General Assembly, is now intensifying its work so that the committee stage of the General Assembly can be completed on Friday, so that the General Assembly plenary meeting can be held on Friday afternoon and Saturday, at which time the various committees will submit their reports. By the beginning of next week, the General Assembly will be ready to proceed with its final important task before the recess, namely, the election of judges of the International Court of Justice. This may take several days, but if this work is started on Monday or Tuesday, there are still several days to deal with any final recommendations that the delegations may make. After the General Assembly adjourns, the Security Council will continue its work. However, the agenda of the Security Council before the end of next week will include the three political issues of Iran, Greece, and Indonesia. The second part of the first session of the General Assembly will be held in the United States. The date is yet to be decided by the General Assembly. It was originally proposed to hold it in the United States in April, but the date may be changed because the three great powers have decided to convene a peace conference in Paris in May. Major politicians who are currently on their way to London to attend the General Assembly include French Foreign Minister Bidault, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie, and Greek Foreign Minister Rantis. Bidault left Paris for England this morning, Lie also left Oslo, and Randis is expected to leave Athens for London tomorrow to lead the Greek delegation in place of Sophoulis.</p>

<p>[United Press London, 30th] The United Nations General Assembly today unanimously approved the immediate establishment of five economic and social committees, including the Human Rights Committee. One of the Human Rights Committee's primary tasks is to begin studying the issue of freedom of the press that has been raised. Once the United Nations agencies are established in the United States, the U.S. delegation will urge the committee to first consider the issue of freedom of the press. Other committees will be responsible for handling temporary social problems, drug problems, and economic and occupational issues. The Human Rights Committee, as one of the important organs of the Economic and Social Council, will assist the Council in promoting human rights. In addition to preparing recommendations on the freedom of the press, its work will be responsible for drafting an international bill of rights and drafting agreements on human rights and freedoms, the status of women, the protection of minorities, and the prevention of discrimination based on race, gender, language, or religion.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, State Day] At the Trusteeship Committee meeting yesterday, there was a divergence of opinion on whether all dependent territories should uniformly obtain actual independence and autonomous government. U.S. representative Dulles believed that the trustee countries should guarantee these rights in order to give the local people hope and courage. Belgian representative Olt said that some territories are in fact unable to achieve independence or autonomy. If the Charter establishes a guaranteed provision, then these territories will also demand these rights. Therefore, he argued that the trustee countries do not have to make guarantees, but must immediately assist the dependent territories to reach a level where they can achieve independence and autonomous government. Australian representative Bailey agreed with the Belgian representative's opinion, while U.S. representative Dulles countered, "The terms 'independence and autonomous government' in the Charter do not legally bind the United Nations. We are practical politicians, not lawyers, so we should allow the people to be independent in order to be practical." The Committee agreed to refer the differing opinions of the U.S. and Belgian representatives to a sub-committee for deliberation.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Administrative Budget Committee: Ecuador's Proposal Recommended for Rejection <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th dispatch] At the afternoon meeting today of the Administrative Budget Subcommittee of the United Nations General Assembly, the representative of Ecuador proposed that the assessment of the United Nations membership fees should not follow the Preparatory Committee's suggestion of dividing the burden based on each member state's capacity, but should instead adopt a progressive system whereby each member state contributes according to a tiered scale. The proposal, initially presented yesterday, was put to a vote after two days of lengthy debate and was rejected by a vote of 20 to 19, with the United States, Iran, and Argentina abstaining. The representative of China, Hu Shih-tse, spoke against the proposal, pointing out the difficulty in estimating the resources of each country and determining the United Nations membership fee based on domestic tax revenue. Furthermore, he argued that the determination of each member state's fee amount involves diplomatic consultations and is not merely a mathematical calculation, thus the principle of paying membership fees according to each country's capacity is no different from a progressive system. The United States, known for its wealth, remained silent during the debate. After the vote, the U.S. representative stated that although the countries that supported the proposal were defeated, they should not be disappointed, and that the principle of dividing the United Nations membership fees according to each country's capacity implicitly contains the spirit of progression. The United States, in this spirit, is willing to pay its full share. However, the representative of Ecuador remained distrustful and reserved the right to submit the matter to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to be Handed Over to the Soviets: The U.S. and Soviet Union Agreed to Attack Japan: Explicitly Stipulated in the Yalta Agreement <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the formal transfer of Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union still requires a peace treaty. According to Acting Secretary of State Acheson, who spoke while Byrnes was in London, the Yalta Conference resolution on the North Pacific region should not be considered a final decision. The Soviet news agency reiterated that the Yalta Agreement's resolution regarding these islands was final. Therefore, Secretary of State Byrnes issued a statement to the press yesterday clarifying the position. The Soviet news agency commented on Acheson's remarks, saying, "Mr. Acheson stated that, to his knowledge, the Yalta Agreement cannot be considered a final agreement to cede the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union. Mr. Acheson further stated that this was his personal opinion, which might be mistaken. The Soviet news agency is instructed to declare that Mr. Acheson's words are indeed mistaken." Byrnes stated that although he attended the Yalta Conference, he only learned of the agreement after Japan's surrender. He believed that President Truman learned of the agreement at the same time. The agreement was signed on the last day of the conference, and he was no longer present. The late President Roosevelt, due to the confidential nature of the document, personally kept it hidden in the White House. The Soviet Union originally agreed at the Crimean Conference to launch a war against Japan on a predetermined date. If the agreement on the Kuril Islands had been announced too early, everyone would have known that the Soviet Union was about to attack Japan. Therefore, when signing the agreement, the U.S. government believed that it should sign a peace treaty at an appropriate time to support the formal transfer of the territory to the Soviet Union. President Truman also shared this view. This was also indicated at the Potsdam Conference when the transfer of West Prussia to Poland was discussed. Byrnes further confirmed that the agreement on the North Pacific was not an oral agreement but a written agreement, which could be released now. Byrnes declined to discuss other islands in the Pacific that the United States wished to establish trusteeships over, stating only that the U.S. government believed that these matters should be resolved by peace treaties.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Japanese Political Parties Launch Election Campaigns: Most Parties Still Use the Emperor as a Rallying Cry: Social Democratic Party and Communist Party Have Not Yet Joined Forces <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th dispatch] With the general election imminent, 31 Japanese political parties have begun their election campaigns. However, most of them are not overly optimistic about their chances of winning, as the candidates of the four major parties alone number 1,300. The Progressive Party, recognizing that the majority of the people still believe in the Emperor system, is using the Emperor system as a political weapon, declaring that it will absolutely protect the Emperor system and recognizing it as a just system, while denigrating the Democratic Front as a "lawyer's declaration." However, in fact, the party is working with the Front on the food issue for the people. Although the party suffered a major blow from MacArthur's fourth purge order in January, it will still nominate 400 candidates, 100 of whom are new replacements. The Liberal Party also holds the same attitude towards the Emperor system but advocates a free economy rather than the Progressive Party's planned economy, although it believes that controls may be necessary in the initial stage. The party's candidates will number at least 300. The Emperor system issue remains a major weapon in the election campaign, as the Social Democratic Party is still unwilling to join forces with the Communist Party to oppose the system. The party claims that since the Communist Party insists on overthrowing the Emperor system, the majority of the Japanese people will support the Social Democratic Party. The party will nominate over 300 candidates. The Communist Party is using the slogans of overthrowing the Shidehara cabinet, establishing a democratic front government, having the people control food, and raising wages as its election slogans, and is using this to appeal to salary earners and farmers as the main body of Communist Party candidates, hoping to appeal to the lower classes with the phrase "farmers will get land and workers will get protection." The party's candidates will number between 250 and 300.</p>

<p>Wuxi: Local Commodity Prices Soar Madly: Since the relocation, commodity prices in the county have been rising gradually. On Monday of this week, they soared madly. The reason for this is that there are rumors of currency changes. Those who have stocks of goods unanimously hoard them and refuse to sell them easily. This morning (29th), red gold sold for 98,000 yuan per tael, and silver ingots sold for 108,000 yuan per tael. White rice sold for 12,500 yuan per picul, and soybean oil sold for 37,000 yuan per dan. Wheat, soybeans, flour, and other commodities were also very expensive. As the end of the year approaches, fresh meat sells for 500 yuan per catty, fish for 400 yuan per catty, and pork for 400 yuan per catty. Mustard greens sell for 50 yuan per catty, and turnips for 20 yuan per catty. Table salt sells for 90 yuan per catty, green fish for 500 yuan per catty, hens for 600 yuan per catty, Huiquan wine for 120 yuan per catty, soy sauce for 120 yuan per catty, and Chinese cabbage for 50 yuan per catty. Continuous overcast and rainy weather has made transportation difficult, which is also a reason for the high prices of various commodities.</p>

The General Headquarters has completed its investigation. Except for the arch-traitor Chen Kung-po and others, who will be interrogated after receiving orders from the National Government, the rest of the large batch of traitors are being prepared for transfer to the judicial organs. However, since the Capital High Court is not yet formally in operation, it was decided in consultation with Xie Ying-chou, Vice Minister of Judicial Administration of the General Headquarters, to transfer all of them to the Suzhou High Court for trial. It is reported that the first batch of 50 people will be completed within a month.</p>

<p>Bengbu: Decline of Changhuai Shipping: The Huai River traverses northern Anhui, making navigation convenient. To maintain security on the water, the Changhuai Water Police Bureau was established. During the enemy-puppet occupation, it was reorganized into the Changhuai Water Police Brigade. After the victory, the Huai Water Police Bureau was restored. According to Lu Mu-tseng, the bureau chief, the bureau has recruited 100 police cadets and a volunteer team to improve the quality of the water police, and they are currently in training. The current Water Police Brigade is stationed upstream and downstream, but the police force has not been deployed in the areas occupied by the Communist army, such as Wuhe and Xuyi. Before the Incident, there were more than 30 regular passenger ships traveling upstream. They were almost completely destroyed during the military conflict. The remaining ships, such as Yong'an, Jianhua, Ruichun, and Lishang, are allocated by the Bengbu Shipping Office of the Anhui Highway Bureau. Although repeated negotiations have been made to recover them, they have not yet been returned. Currently, the only private ships operating upstream on the Changhuai River are Hengfa, Jia'e, Fenglehe, and Xinguoxing, which travel between Bengbu, Tianji'an, and Zhengyangguan. The shipping industry is in decline and it is difficult to restore it to its former state in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Before the Ink Was Dry on the Sino-Siamese Treaty, Another Anti-Chinese Incident Erupted: When Li Tiehzeng Visited Nakhon Pathom, Siamese Police and Thugs Launched a Major Riot <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 30th dispatch] The head of the Chinese delegation, Li Tiehzeng, protested to the Siamese government because an anti-Chinese incident occurred in Nakhon Pathom when he visited the city on the 27th. He demanded that the perpetrators who attacked the overseas Chinese be appropriately punished, and the Siamese government guaranteed to provide appropriate protection to the overseas Chinese in the future. Prince Wan Waithayakon, the chief Siamese representative in the negotiations for the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, visited Li Tiehzeng yesterday, on behalf of the Siamese government, to express his regret for the unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nakhon Pathom, 27th dispatch] Four days after the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, a twist occurred in Sino-Siamese relations. An anti-Chinese incident occurred in Nakhon Pathom today, with one overseas Chinese killed and several injured. This incident occurred when the Chinese delegation, led by Li Tiehzeng, came to the city. The city is located 55 kilometers west of Bangkok. Judging from the entire course of events, it was an organized and premeditated provocative action, possibly initiated by radical Siamese elements who sought to sabotage the visit of the Chinese delegation to demonstrate and undermine the friendship between the two countries. The incident occurred just as the welcoming meeting for the delegation by the overseas Chinese in Nakhon Pathom was about to begin. Thousands of overseas Chinese in the city participated in the meeting, as did the city's county magistrate and police chief. Li Tiehzeng and the city's county magistrate both emphasized the friendship between the two countries and urged the people of both countries to live in harmony. Li also advised the overseas Chinese to abide by the law and explained that they had obtained preferential treatment from the Siamese government with the conclusion of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. The meeting proceeded smoothly until Li and his party left the meeting and went to the local branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, when a gunshot suddenly rang out, and the overseas Chinese who attended the meeting fled in panic. The whole city was plunged into terror and chaos, and the unprecedented atmosphere of celebration in the city disappeared in an instant. During the chaos, the head of the delegation, Li Tiehzeng, remained calm and continued to travel by car to the overseas Chinese school for a welcoming luncheon hosted by the overseas Chinese in the city. The truth about the facts only became clear after the Chinese delegation returned from Banpong, 30 kilometers west of the city. After the welcoming meeting ended, several incidents occurred in quick succession. Siamese police and ruffians began to beat up overseas Chinese near the venue. When an overseas Chinese suddenly shouted at the end of the meeting and was about to investigate, he was shot, with two bullets hitting his back in vital areas. Another overseas Chinese was stabbed in the face. The Siamese person who committed the crime was later released. Two Siamese people took the opportunity to rob during the chaos. Two partner overseas Chinese butchers were not only forcibly robbed of 3,000 Siamese baht, but also brutally beaten. The two thugs also threatened to burn down their houses at night. After Li Tiehzeng and his party returned to Nakhon Pathom from Banpong, they went to the hospital to inspect the remains of the overseas Chinese who had been killed. The city's county magistrate and police chief deeply apologized to Li for the occurrence of such an incident during his visit to Nathon Pathom. They guaranteed to do their best to suppress future friction between the two sides and would report the matter to their superiors in Bangkok. After the shooting, the city's police chief ordered all Siamese police officers to return to the station. However, even though the Siamese police returned to the station, Siamese ruffians roamed the streets with clubs and other weapons in the evening, committing illegal acts and brutally beating any overseas Chinese they encountered, making the situation even more serious. While Li Tiehzeng and the city's police chief were waiting in the hospital for the autopsy results, another disturbance broke out, and overseas Chinese who were demolishing the bamboo sheds for the welcoming meeting were again severely beaten by groups of Siamese thugs. One overseas Chinese had his head and face broken and was sent to the hospital. The tense situation prompted former Dutch prisoners of war who were defending the area to suggest acting as neutral officers for the Siamese police. Li Tiehzeng and the city's county magistrate accepted the suggestion, and Dutch patrols and machine gun squads guarded the entire city. The Chinese delegation only left the city in the evening after receiving assurances from the local authorities that they would suppress the recurrence of similar incidents, and they were escorted by the city's county magistrate to a safe area far from the city. It is reported that when Li Tiehzeng arrived in Bangkok, he would take appropriate steps with the Siamese government regarding this matter.</p>

<p>— Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper on the 25th; Sent by Zhao Zhaosheng</p>
<p>On January 25th, Chongqing—this glorious city—shone with the pure calls of over ten thousand passionate young people. This day will be a radiant and blossoming day in the memories of young people across the country.</p>
<p>Over ten thousand students from Chongqing's Shapingba district, including those from National Central University, Chongqing University, Central Engineering School, the attached high school of National Central University, Chongqing High School, Shudu High School, Sichuan Institute of Education, Tongli Business School, National Vocational Schools, Yucai School, and others, held a joint demonstration and petition to promote the success of the Political Consultative Conference and to protest to Britain and France regarding the Pingshan Airport and the Beierding Incident. Their rigorous organization and excellent discipline established a model for the most outstanding democratic movement.</p>
<p>Making Big Banners from Bed Sheets</p>
<p>This large-scale action was first initiated by National Central University. They first held a meeting of department representatives to decide on the organization, principles, declarations, and slogans. At three o'clock in the morning on the 25th, after eating a little leftover porridge, they began preparing to depart. They used their own bed sheets and bamboo poles cut from Songlin Slope to erect large banners. The cold rain could not stop the passionate steps of the young people, and the long journey of more than thirty kilometers could not thwart their enthusiasm and determination. Starting from Shaba, this mighty team, organized into large and medium units by department, marched mightily towards Chongqing city. The people of Shapingba set off firecrackers to cheer them on. Faculty and staff organized service stations along the way to serve this glorious team. The students of the National Central University Baixi branch only learned of the news the afternoon before. Although it was a problem for these thousands of people to cross the river and hurry, they did not hesitate or consider. They stayed up all night making slogans and flags, crossed the river in the rain at midnight, and rushed to join the main force.</p>
<p>"Quick Reports" Printed in Cars</p>
<p>From Hualongqiao straight to Liziba, what a magnificent team, what glorious flags, what orderly ranks, and what magnificent shouts! Wu Youxun, President of National Central University, Sha Xuejun, Ren Meiyi, Ouyang Zhu, Liu Shichao, Jiang Mengyin, and other professors, Zhang Hongyuan, President of Chongqing University, Professor Ma Yinchu, as well as teaching assistants, lecturers, and even school workers were all in the ranks. Propaganda cars were distributing slogans and declarations and printing "Quick Reports" in the cars. Each student wore a symbol representing their department identity. The students of National Central University wore the gray military uniforms issued by the school. Although their clothes were poorer than those of the students eight years ago, this was precisely a mark of their glorious struggle. Disciplinarians rode bicycles to clear the road in front, behind, left, and right. Near Hualongqiao, two suspicious people were discovered in the team, immediately reported, and handed over to the military police. The lessons of past events have made Chinese youth calm and clear-headed, cultivating their high degree of vigilance.</p>
<p>At Niujiaotuo, they encountered Special Envoy Marshall passing by in a five-star marshal's car. He slowly followed the procession towards Qing Temple.</p>
<p>A little after eleven o'clock, the main force arrived at the National Government. Soon after, the team from the National Central University Baixi branch also arrived. The long journey of more than fifty kilometers left them covered in sweat, and everyone applauded to console them. At this time, from the highest level of the National Government Auditorium to outside the gate, was an endless crowd, with various colors and sizes of flags. Tens of thousands of people who had come with the procession were crowding in front of the National Government gate, and traffic on National Government Road was completely cut off.</p>
<p>Sun Ke Firmly Guarantees</p>
<p>"The Political Consultative Conference must succeed, not fail!" "National interests are above all else!" "Support Chairman Chiang's leadership in peaceful nation-building!" "No political party shall possess an army!" "Demand domestic unification, peace, and democracy!" "Thoroughly implement the ceasefire order!" "Both sides release political prisoners!" "Nationalize the army and democratize politics!" "Take back Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau!" "Replace the French Consul-General in Shanghai!" Magnificent slogans rang out here.</p>
<p>The members of the Political Consultative Conference were holding subgroup consultations in the National Government Auditorium and lounge. Student representatives first met with Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, to present their seven demands and invite representatives of various parties to speak. Facing these more than ten thousand pure and passionate young people, listening to these sky-shattering calls, no one was not sincerely moved. Then, Mr. Sun Ke first spoke. In front of the temporarily installed loudspeaker, he said loudly: I dare to firmly guarantee to all of you students that the Political Consultative Conference will definitely succeed perfectly within a few days! I fully agree with the slogans you are calling! The crowd burst into applause and cheers following President Sun's speech. Next, Zhou Enlai spoke, saying that the Communist Party also fully agreed with everyone's opinions. However, when he stated that the civil war had already stopped, the entire audience shouted loudly: "It hasn't stopped completely!" Zhou then explained to everyone that now, all parties and factions are working together under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to ensure that all problems are resolved perfectly. Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Mo Dehui, Shao Lizi, and other gentlemen subsequently reported, unanimously agreeing with everyone's demands and guaranteeing that the Political Consultative Conference must succeed, not fail.</p>
<p>Tears Streamed Down Across the Entire Field</p>
<p>When everyone once again requested that a non-partisan representative speak, the elderly Mr. Mo Dehui, supported by someone, stepped down the steps from the National Government Auditorium. With the tears and ardent wishes of the Northeastern compatriots, he came to speak to everyone again. He said: This time, after returning from the Northeast via Tianjin and Beiping, the people asked him to convey to the Political Consultative Conference, "They can no longer suffer from the scourge of war! Whoever wants to fight, I will risk my old life to fight him!" The old gentleman was trembling all over with excitement, his tears streaming down, sobbing uncontrollably. National Central University President Wu cried, and all the students and the crowd crowding outside the National Government gate cried. The reporter standing next to the loudspeaker was recording these moving words with his entire life, listening to the sad and trembling gasps of this white-haired old man, and also burst into tears unconsciously. Yes, cry! Recognize the truth through tears. Only those who can cry are those who understand love and hate! In the National Government Square, at this moment, the pure tears of millions of people were communicating with the tears of the struggling compatriots in North China!</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Makes a Great Appeal</p>
<p>Mr. Mo also said in an extremely firm and passionate voice: Eight years ago, at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang had explained to him his determination to "resist to the end." In his old age, he struggled for eight years under the inspiration of the Chairman. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, today, he is willing to explain to everyone with his own belief: Chairman Chiang will definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and make this meeting a success. If this meeting is not successful, he will suggest to Chairman Chiang not to close the meeting, and he himself will not leave here and will not return to the Northeast. "Young brothers! Whether our country can stand among the four powers in the future depends on whether the Political Consultative Conference can succeed!" Mr. Mo's appeal caused excitement across the entire field, which lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>Then the presidium announced that the parade was about to begin. Office staff distributed steamed buns at this time. Everyone chewed on the dry steamed buns they brought, sitting on the ground. Before the boiled water was delivered, the parade had already begun to depart. From the National Government—Shangqing Temple—Lianglukou—Qixinggang—Douyu Street—Huiping Street—Zhongzheng Road—Kaixuan Road—Linsen Road—Heping Road, the people in the urban area welcomed this glorious team with even greater cheers. The Chongqing news reporters, as well as the American financial advisor Yang Ge, and his colleague Steel, were all running alongside them. In the consulate lane, in front of the British and French embassies, everyone pasted more English slogans and shouted English slogans. People who came out of the embassies stared at the crowd shouting for the protection of national rights and interests.</p>
<p>At five o'clock, the parade ended, and over ten thousand pure young people had perfectly completed this magnificent and moving epic, and joy and excitement illuminated their return journey.</p>
<p>The One Who First Addressed the Students...</p>
<p>Member of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke</p>
<p>American Medical Community Invents Hemostatic Cotton Wound Treatment</p>
<p>A preparation specialist at an American private laboratory installed a temperature regulator on a vacuum oven used for drying blood. The newly made hemostatic cotton can be used by surgeons. The method involves extracting plasma from human blood, then using the blood clot to make a kind of product, followed by protein, a protein element in the blood. Once it encounters air, it causes the blood to clot, preventing excessive bleeding from the wound. The protein foam on the surgical wound can be converted into a blood clot. When applied, it is placed on the wound and allowed the blood to gradually absorb it. This kind of hemostatic cotton can not only prevent excessive bleeding during surgery, but also prevent the risk of massive bleeding after surgery.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Retrospective on the Life of Harry Hopkins, Former Personal Advisor to President Roosevelt <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Passing of an American Brain Trust</p>
<p>Image of Harry Hopkins</p>
<p>This Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>The news of Mr. Hopkins' death yesterday shocked the entire American nation, and even the soldiers and civilians of the United Nations mourned together, because he was a classmate of the late President Roosevelt and a powerful figure who assisted him in defeating the Nazi enemy. His brief history is recorded below:</p>
<p>Impoverished Family; Son of a Harness Maker</p>
<p>Harry Hopkins' family was very poor in his childhood. His father was a harness maker in Grinnell, Iowa. Although Hopkins' family was very poor, under the strong leadership of his father, he finally completed his university education and obtained a Doctor of Laws degree. At the age of fifteen, he began to engage in social work, serving as an investigator for the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, delving into every poor community, conducting on-the-ground investigations of the lives of the poor, and seeing every dark side of the lower class. This was of great help to the development of his future life experience and career.</p>
<p>World War I; Enlisted in Red Cross Service</p>
<p>In 1917, the United States was involved in the First European War, and Hopkins joined the Red Cross to serve as the director of the Gulf of Mexico, burying himself in relief work. In 1922, he returned to New York and served as the vice president of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. Two years later, he was appointed as the secretary-general of the New York Tuberculosis Association.</p>
<p>His acquaintance with Roosevelt dates back to the time of the American presidential election in 1928. At that time, Roosevelt was the governor of New York State. In order to gain public confidence, Roosevelt organized the "Temporary Emergency Relief Administration" to plan a large-scale relief effort for 800,000 unemployed people. Hopkins was appointed as the vice president of the association at that time. A year later, he was promoted to president, fully responsible for the large-scale relief efforts in New York State. Due to his capable handling of affairs, from this time on, his political status gradually rose and he was noticed.</p>
<p>In 1933, Roosevelt was elected president. In January of 1934, Roosevelt appointed him as Secretary of Commerce. Although he had detailed plans for the reform of the Department of Commerce, he suffered from a very serious stomach illness at that time, and his health was abnormal, and much time was spent traveling to various places for recuperation.</p>
<p>From 1939, Hopkins served as Roosevelt's personal advisor, planning extensively during the depression and war, and Roosevelt relied on him as a confidant. In Washington, his reputation was not very prominent. During the war, Hopkins served not only as the President's Advisor, but also as Chairman of the Munitions Board.</p>
<p>Followed Roosevelt and Attended Major Conferences</p>
<p>He participated in the Casablanca Conference, the Quebec Conference, the Cairo Conference, the Tehran Conference, and the Yalta Conference. He also attended the famous shipboard conference in August 1941, where the Atlantic Charter was drafted. During the war, he represented President Roosevelt on four visits to London. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Roosevelt urgently sent Hopkins to see Stalin. Upon returning to the United States, he reported to Congress that the Soviet Union was determined to fight to the end. In 1938, as Secretary of Commerce, he attended the Senate to testify about his relationship with President Roosevelt, stating: "Since I have been appointed by the President as an administrator, I have served the President and trusted the President. If the Senate approves the appointment, I can predict that what is approved is someone who will wholeheartedly serve the President and advocate for the President's ideas, and since I trust the President's ideas, I should, of course, be loyal to the President."</p>
<p>Outstanding Talent; Appreciated by Stalin</p>
<p>Stalin appreciated Hopkins more than any other United Nations official. After returning from a visit to the Soviet Union last summer, his health deteriorated, and he soon retired. Later, he accepted the position of chairman of the New York Women's Clothing Industry, specializing in arbitration of wages and other labor issues.</p>
<p>Hopkins's second wife was Ms. St. Macy, whom he married at the White House in July 1942. His first wife had two sons and a daughter. His son was killed in action in the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>Hopkins was 56 years old.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Mansion of Secret Books, the Mountain of Precious Stones: The Old Collection of Haiyuan Pavilion Is Now Preserved by the Beiping Library <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The books of the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were recently purchased by President Song in Tianjin for 15 million legal tender, nationalized, and kept in the reading room of the Beiping Library. These treasures were acquired fifteen years ago by the Cunhai Academy, organized by Zhang Ting'e, Mo Yulin, and others, and stored in the Tianjin Salt Industry Bank. After browsing through it a few years ago, Zangyuan Jushi Chuan Zengxiang wrote "A Brief Account of the Collection of Haiyuan Pavilion," which explained in detail the existing rare books. The original text is excerpted below for reference by those who care about it at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Since the books of the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were scattered, all scholars who love books and antiquities, as well as contemporary famous officials and giant townships, have rushed to inform each other and plan a way to preserve them, either searching in glass factories, or visiting the capitals of Shandong, or consulting with the descendants of the Yang family.</p>
<p>In our country in the last hundred years, the great book collectors, Southern Zhai and Northern Yang, are known throughout the country for their grand and rich collections. The source and transmission of ancient books are fully documented. If the Zhimi Tower of the Lu family and the Eight Thousand Volume Tower of the Yao family are newly built states, they are not enough to be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>Since the news of the loss of the cabinet books came out, the factory estimators ran around, west to Baoding, Shunde, and Daming, east to Fuzhou, Jinan, and Qingdao, rising like clouds and surging like waves, exhausting their efforts to search and gather them in various shops in Tianjin and Beijing, while the descendants of the Yang family, due to living in exile and depleting their property, also sold their collections in order to seek a good price. In the past two or three years, slightly less than half of those scattered have been lost. When I was a guest in Tianjin last year, I saw the second series of Song editions, a total of twenty-six copies, and most of them were taken away by powerful people one after another. Because I did not have the money to try to eat a slice of the pie, the secret books copied and collated that appeared in Haiwang Village were also almost completely purchased by official institutions and private families, and often even a small volume of copied and collated books was priced at a thousand gold, let alone the ancient Song and Yuan editions. The speaker then said that the essence of the Song Cun Room was almost exhausted, but judging from the direct appreciation, the matter was not necessarily so. According to the Yang family's collection, it is known as beautiful and rich, but what their father and son are especially proud of is only the Four Classics and Four Histories, so they separately titled the studio name in the Song Book Room, and Mei Boyan wrote the Haiyuan Pavilion Records, saying that those who rank books after the Six Arts and various philosophers and poetry are all streams, not their source.</p>
<p>Now, let us list the precious and secret ones separately on the left. Those that have not been fully viewed in a hurry have not been detailed. The Song edition of the Mao Poetry, is an exquisite pocket-sized edition. The Song edition of the Shangshu Cai Shi Zhuan is a large-character, exquisite, and rare. The Song edition of the Book of Rites is a former possession of the Ming Xing's Laiqin Hall. The Song Fuzhou edition of the Book of Rites is an early print with paper as clean as jade and ink as black as lacquer. The Song Qiandao edition of the Records of the Grand Historian is carved with exquisite skill. This is the first edition of the Records of the Grand Historian annotated by three scholars, which I have never seen in my life. The Song edition of the Book of Han is a large-character, elegant and beautiful copy with hooks and strokes drawn in silver. The Song edition of the Book of Later Han is as elegant and vigorous as the Records of the Grand Historian. It is the most exquisite edition after the Jianben edition. The Song edition of the Records of the Three Kingdoms is the rarest of the Song editions of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, and it is more difficult to obtain than a fine print. The Song edition of Shishuo is a unique copy in the country. The Song edition of the Spring and Autumn Annals Name Diagram is a fine copy formerly owned by Jigu. The Song edition of the Great Dai Ritual Record is the rarest and most secret, and I am afraid that there are no two copies in the world. The Song edition of Zhu Wengong's Family Ritual is a large-character, exquisite, and neat copy. The Song edition of Lishu is elegant and pleasing to the eye. The original title was mistakenly written as a copy. The Song edition of the Book of Han. The Song edition of the Book of Later Han. Although there are Yuan revisions in one book, it is extremely difficult to obtain a complete copy. The Song edition of Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi is a fine print on thin paper carved in the early Southern Song Dynasty. The Song edition of Liang Han Chuan Kai is ancient, elegant, and rare. The Song edition of Fang Yu Sheng Lan is a book that is often damaged. This copy is uniquely printed early and is complete and valuable. The Song edition of Zheng Lei Bencao is carved in the ancient style of Sichuan and is rare in the world. The Song edition of Lisao is a book of drafts, a unique secret book. The Song edition of Luo Binwang's Collection is a Song Sichuan edition, which is ancient, elegant, and unparalleled. The copy is also exquisite. The Song edition of Yuan Feng Lei Gao is a large-character, elegant, and vigorous copy. The Song edition of Shi Jinshanshui Ji is the only copy in the world, carved in an ancient and elegant style. The Song edition of Liu Houchun Ji is exquisite, clean, and complete. The Yuan edition of Le Shu is neat and orderly, and I suspect that it is a Song edition. The Yuan edition of Erya is a fine early print. The Mao manuscript of Shiyao Erya. The Mao manuscript of Han Jian. The Mao manuscript of Xikun Chouchang Ji. (The above three books are finely written by Jigu and should be treasured as much as Song editions.) In addition, there are many fine Song and Yuan editions of various books, but they are commonly seen in my life and will not be mentioned again. As for the various copies and collations, most of them are famous works by Lu Leiguang, He Yimen, Gu Qianli, and Zhang Ren'an, and Huang Ruoyan collated more than ten kinds, and most of them are based on ancient books, and they are also Song Ping editions, which are especially valuable, which are one level lower than Song editions. In recent years, cultural and educational revival, and the love of books and antiquities, has become a fashion. When people occasionally see ancient engravings and old manuscripts, they are all shocked and regard them as treasures. Even those who obtain one or two elevate themselves and issue proclamations to solicit titles. This is what Qian Shou'an called the poor eyes of the Wu people. If they were to see this, what would they think? In conclusion, the Yang family's books were accumulated in ten thousand volumes and preserved for three generations, but now they have been scattered in one day, and everyone in the country sighs and regrets it. If you want to collect and search for them and restore them to their former glory, it is not an easy task, but according to what I have seen, there are still less than half of the remaining books.

<h3 id="e40">Report on the Real Situation in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I was deeply moved after reading your newspaper's article "The Communist Party's Benevolent Governance in Yantai" yesterday. We, who live in Northern Jiangsu, suffer greatly, all caused by the Communist Party, and there is even worse. Now, briefly describe the following: The Communist Party treats human life like child's play. For example, Sheng Jie, the district chief of Jitang District, Dongtai, kills several people every day on average. Also, the instructor Ma Bin also enjoys killing people. On average, more than 300 people are killed by the above two in half a year, so the number of people who died at the hands of the two is unknown. Anyone living in their area cannot talk about freedom at all. Being able to keep one's life intact is a great blessing. What "democracy" is there? If young people do not participate in work or join the "Party," they are said to be waiting for the "old central government" and accused of being "national special agents," and are sentenced to death, or thrown into the water to drown, or buried alive in the soil to suffocate, or thrown into the fire to burn to death. Their doctrine is "If you are not for me, I will not keep you." What is even more ridiculous is that when nothing is happening, young women are invited to the assembly field to "confess" private matters, and they are told to say, "How many lovers do you have? When did you meet secretly?..." Everything must be "confessed" and reported, and we will all attack and insult them, saying that if you do not "confess," you are not worthy of being a person under the rule of the Communist Party. Therefore, young people and women have fled to Shanghai, Nantong, Taizhou and other places, waiting for the National Army to descend, like hoping for rain in a severe drought. In the Yancheng-Funing area, there is also a so-called "Smell Fragrance Team." If a family's diet is slightly better, such as eating fish and meat, they will smell it, or suddenly break in and see the pot lid, and immediately consider it a capitalist enjoying life, and immediately confiscate the property. There are also "Nimble Girl" (female detectives), one nimble girl is sent to manage every ten households, who can enter and leave houses freely and investigate the situation of the ten households. If the words are slightly inconsistent, they are named "national special agents," detained for investigation, and even shot. Other things, such as Shanghai newspapers and legal tender, are prohibited from entering the country, which we believe is for special work. Recently, someone from northern Jiangsu said that they are now arresting men to enlist in the army, gathering a large number of young people, waiting to be developed. Therefore, the people of northern Jiangsu have recently been in deep water and are looking forward to the National Army entering day and night to relieve the urgent need. The above are all the real situations in northern Jiangsu. Please publish it in your newspaper as a blessing. A youth from a brigade in northern Jiangsu. January 28th.</p>
<p>Procuring Grain and Levying Grain</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: The country has been fighting for eight years, the soldiers have been fighting bloody battles for eight years, the people in the rear have been bearing heavy burdens for eight years, and the people in the occupied areas have been squeezed for eight years. Everyone is living through hardship. The Japanese pirates felt the threat of the Allied countries and surrendered unconditionally. Chairman Chiang sympathized with the people in the occupied areas and exempted land taxes and reduced rents. The people were celebrating and thanking Chairman Chiang's kindness, but soon something that made the people laugh and cry came. In the past, our country has always purchased military rice through rice merchants, but this time it also followed the method during the occupation period, apportioning it to households according to the fields and collecting it at a low price. The people suffered such a loss. Wouldn't they laugh and cry? But is this method the same in all recovered provinces? Or is it just Wuxi County? According to the current market price, each stone of brown rice requires more than 8,000 legal tender, while the assigned price can only get 4,500 legal tender after deducting the delivery fee. Who knows such a dark loss? Even the money can only be received after the rice is delivered. The procedures are troublesome, and the piecemeal dismantling is very large. Isn't it unfair! The Japanese pirates forced the collection, and the stored grain was abundant, which could be used, but why was there no gain? Cao Weizhi, Wuxi.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Class is Late to Start School</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I sincerely hope that you can give me a corner of valuable space in your newspaper to publish it. It is really frustrating to say. I am a high school graduate who happened to graduate under the rule of the "enemy puppets." At that time, because I did not go to take the "puppet" national university exam, I was delayed and never entered the door of the university. I thought that there would be a better arrangement after the victory. Who knows how dissatisfied the facts will give us. I am afraid that the people from all walks of life who uphold justice will not believe it! After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang set up a temporary university tutorial class in Beijing, Shanghai and other places to care for the out-of-school youth in the recovered areas, but they were rejected because they were not "puppet university" students. Fortunately, the preparatory class was set up accordingly. I tried again. After an entrance examination, I finally "sailed smoothly" and was "on the list." I always thought that I could start school and attend classes soon, but I still don't know anything about it. However, several high school classmates who took the "puppet university" exam are gloriously attending tutorial classes! Mr. Editor, is this the disappointment brought by the victory, but the education authorities are rewarding them and punishing us? Furthermore, there is clearly such a clause on the enrollment advertisement of the preparatory class "...From the date of the start of school to July 20th of the 35th year, there will be no winter vacation to complete a one-year academic program..." Such a strange and grand rhetoric, now that people are on winter vacation, it is still a "start date to be notified separately." Is this a sign that there will be no winter vacation? I don't like to see grandiose words, I don't like to hear pleasing perfunctory remarks, I just ask to give me a quick arrangement, a really practical arrangement, and don't post announcements, no matter how many announcements, the facts are still the facts, please don't underestimate it anymore, gentlemen. Maybe these adults and gentlemen are somersaulting in "waiting for cause and obeying," or suffering from severe "amnesia"? People are recruiting, starting school and attending classes again, but what about us...? If the preparatory class authorities think that it will still take a considerable amount of time to attend classes, it is okay to allow us to take back our certificates, but we still need to maintain the academic quota. "Let us take other university exams, and don't forget that our certificates are being "kept" by you. I know that many of these students must be hoping for it too! Rhyme, January 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e41">On the Issue of Setting the Value of Currency <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>A recent Associated Press dispatch from Washington stated that officials in Washington are closely watching the development of China's trade. According to the news from the dispatch, American officials and businessmen believe that it is currently impossible to be overly optimistic about the early resumption of large-scale trade between China and the United States. They believe that even if China achieves political stability, economic and legal obstacles will still be numerous. American officials believe that China's main problem at the moment is the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate. Only after this exchange rate is issued can trade activities with China begin. However, they also believe that before determining this exchange rate, the Chinese government will be forced to issue a new currency system, so the Chinese government will carefully consider the determination of the new exchange rate. The Bretton Woods Agreement stipulates that countries that sign the agreement shall not exceed 10% of the value of their currency without the consent of this international organization, and China is one of the signatories to this international agreement. If the determination of the new exchange rate is impractical, it will not only fail to help China's foreign trade recover, but will also be harmful. In addition, American officials have also pointed out the new company law in our country, believing that the clause that foreign companies must have a head office in a foreign country will be detrimental to China and run counter to the original intention of welcoming foreign investment. What we should pay special attention to in this dispatch is the issue of our country's currency system. This is indeed not only related to the recovery of our country's foreign trade, but also related to the prosperity and decline of our entire national economy and the stability of social order. I would like to express my views on this matter.</p>
<p>First of all, we want to declare that a country will inevitably cause currency problems and related currency reform issues after a long period of war. This was the case with France and Germany after the First World War, and the United Kingdom and the United States also had currency reform issues one after another. Although the abolition of the gold standard in the United Kingdom and the devaluation of the US dollar did not happen immediately after the war, the reason for the problems was closely related to the First World War. During the Second World War, it goes without saying that the currency systems of Germany, Italy and Japan had problems. France also had its serious currency problems, which I will not mention much. Even the UK and the US themselves had currency problems, but their problems were not very obvious. However, the general decline in the purchasing power of currency is a fact. Our country has been fighting for the longest time and has suffered the most financial trauma. Therefore, our currency problem is particularly serious. This problem does not end with the end of the war; in a sense, the end of the war is the beginning of this problem. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we had to rely on printing machines and constantly manufacture new legal tender to cope with war expenses and national expenditures in a financial situation where tax sources were exhausted. This is not something to be ashamed of. This is also the case in the UK and the US, but they naturally managed it very well, so there was no such increasingly serious problem as ours. Our people should forgive the government for having to rely on increasing issuance to cope with the national treasury during the war. However, increasing issuance is a poisonous drug, somewhat like drinking poison to quench thirst. Today, all problems can be related to currency issues, and there is no talk of any recovery if financial affairs are not properly managed after the war! Our people should forgive the government for relying on issuance to maintain the national treasury during the war; but the war has ended for nearly half a year, and the government should quickly seek a solution to the currency problem. Otherwise, if the problem becomes serious, how will it face the people?</p>
<p>At present, China's currency system can be said to be extremely chaotic. It goes without saying that the counterfeit currency issued by the enemy puppet government, even in terms of legal currency, the legal currency in the recovered areas of Jinghu and Jiangnan forms a system, the legal currency in North China forms a system, and the legal currency in Northeast China forms a system. In addition, Taiwan forms a system. Such a complex system is indeed an inevitable situation caused by coping with the surrender at that time, but this situation cannot be allowed to continue for a long time. This requires a quick reorganization. However, this is only a superficial problem; the core of the problem is how to seek the stability of the currency value. If the currency value cannot be stabilized, all currency system reforms will be impossible to implement; and if the currency system is not reformed, not only will all financial reforms be impossible to implement, but also the country's recovery will not be able to get on the right track.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the re-determination of the exchange rate can stabilize the value of the currency. If the currency cannot be stabilized, it will inevitably affect the re-determination of the exchange rate. This cycle will become a vicious cycle, which will not help solve the actual problem, and may even make the problem more serious. We are not in a position to speculate on what the American officials mean by the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate. If the current black market exchange rate is used to stabilize the Chinese legal tender at around 1,500 yuan, although it is a "realistic" decision, it will be harmful to the development of China's national economy and will undoubtedly become a blow to my country's growing national industry. In terms of current prices, some Chinese-made products will not be able to compete with imported products. Therefore, the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate is not only a monetary problem, but also a tariff problem. We must seek the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate in the application of tariff policies. As for the widely spread multi-tier exchange rate system, if we can properly use tariff policies without any resistance, there is no need for such complicated measures.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the currency value has two meanings: one is to seek the stability of the domestic currency value; the other is to seek the stability of the foreign currency value. The former is somewhat determined by the latter, and the latter is somewhat sufficient to affect the former. The currency problem in our country today involves too many things. In the effort to reorganize the currency system, what is needed is a spirit of perseverance and decisiveness, and a bold and decisive style. The financial and monetary system, which is already terminally ill, can only be revived by major surgery. Our country's pre-war currency system was not sound, and now it is riddled with holes. A thorough reform should be carried out in due course. Germany's reorganization of the Mark after the First World War and Russia's reorganization of the Ruble can be used as our reference. It is currently rumored in Shanghai that the government is about to issue "Sun" currency. Although Yu Yuzhang has denied it, we believe that, given the current situation, even if the new currency is not issued for a while, it may no longer be possible to solve our currency problem by relying solely on the re-determination of the exchange rate.</p>
<p>In short, how to solve the current currency problem is the government's top priority. In Shanghai, prices have been rising since the recovery nearly four months ago, which means that the currency value has been falling. We cannot attribute the rise in prices to other factors. We must know that this is mainly a currency problem. The social unrest, the turbulence in people's lives, and the difficulties in the government's finances are all due to the fact that this problem has not been reasonably resolved. The government should deal with this problem as soon as possible and take appropriate measures so that all other problems can be gradually resolved and gradually return to normal.</p>

<p>Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai Longhua Airport at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those who came with him included Counselor Xu Shilu, Secretary Zhu Zhongdao, Ji Ping, Yin Birong, Zhou Yuemei, Adjutant Lai Zhanpeng, etc. Miss Hu Zhantang's daughter, Mulan, also came to Shanghai on the same flight. After Song got off the plane, he rested briefly, and at 4:00 p.m., he went to the President's Office of the Bank of China Building. He immediately summoned Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan President's Office in Shanghai, Chen Hang, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager, Qian Changzhao of the Resources Committee, etc. They left at 7:00 p.m. According to reporters, Song and his party originally planned to fly to Taiwan at 8:00 a.m. on the 29th, but unexpectedly, the plane experienced obstacles when it was only a foot away from the ground, so they had to land for repairs. They then received a telegram from Taiwan stating that the weather there had suddenly changed and was not suitable for navigation, so the trip to Taiwan was temporarily suspended, and they changed to take a flight to Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. It is also learned that President Song has established the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Enemy Puppet Industry Processing Bureau in Guangzhou, with Du Jiyong, the former special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian, as the director. The former Guangdong Enemy Puppet Industry Office has been cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Labor representatives' words and deeds are inconsistent, and the power labor unrest has twists and turns again. Most workshops are disappointed <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The power company's labor unrest was personally mediated by Director Wu Kaixian the day before yesterday, and the stalemate could have been broken. Even late at night, the situation changed again due to the change in the attitude of the labor representatives. The following is a record of Director Wu's mediation yesterday.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian explained earnestly</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives from both sides continued to negotiate at the Social Bureau, and the talks became closer and closer. Regarding the labor representatives' request for a uniform 10% pension, after several rounds of coordination by the Social Bureau, the company representatives have expressed their acceptance, and the two sides are getting closer and closer. The labor representatives are arguing about the reinstatement and reasonable salary increase of the five temporary workers. After 5:00 p.m., Director Wu, after consulting the opinions of the capital representatives on various issues, summoned labor representatives Ouyang Zhirun and others for talks. Land Commissioner Jingshi, Wang Committee Member Xianqing, Zhang Section Chief Zhenyuan, and representatives of the five major public utilities trade unions were present. Director Wu explained each of the eleven conditions proposed by the labor representatives that still needed to be discussed. Regarding the reinstatement of the five temporary workers and the rationalization of this year's salary increase, he expressed his views, saying that the capital representatives had provided contracts to prove that there were sufficient reasons for the dismissal of the five temporary workers, but he personally sympathized with the five workers and was willing to provide assistance. In addition to instructing the capital representatives to issue an additional month's salary as severance pay, he would do his best to find a job for them. Regarding the rationalization of the salary increase, the labor and capital sides had previously reached an agreement and provided various materials, and submitted them to the municipal government for arbitration. He would urge the municipal government to submit them to arbitration as soon as possible to speed up the solution, and hoped to resume work first tomorrow, and he would do his best to seek a reasonable solution for everyone. After speaking, the whole audience applauded warmly.</p>
<p>Labor representatives volunteered to persuade</p>
<p>Labor representative Ouyang Zhirun immediately expressed his intention to return to the factory and persuade all workers to resume work first. Director Wu asked whether the Social Bureau needed to send representatives to the power company with the municipal party department to jointly persuade them. Ouyang replied that he would be responsible for persuading all workers to resume work first, and the Social Bureau and the municipal party department did not need to send representatives. Representatives of the five major public utilities, the telephone company, the water company, the French tram company, the British tram company and the gas company, were also very excited and willing to accompany the labor representatives to the factory to jointly persuade all employees to resume work first.</p>
<p>Sudden change of attitude, opposed to resuming work</p>
<p>According to reporters who inquired late at night: When the representative of the power company, Ouyang Zhirun, left the Social Bureau, he suddenly refused the representatives of the five major public utilities companies to go to the power company to persuade them. After Ouyang and others returned to the power company, they did not convene a meeting of all workers, but only held a meeting of directors and supervisors. The discussion continued until 11:00 p.m. Because Ouyang and others firmly opposed resuming work, there was no result. Most workers were eager to return home because the Lunar New Year was approaching, and they were quite disappointed.</p>

<p>(3) The employees of the Zhengweihua Real Estate General Branch went on strike because the labor side raised the issue of year-end bonuses, and the opinions of the two sides could not be approached, resulting in no result. The Social Bureau has scheduled to convene representatives of both sides again at 10:00 a.m. today to continue mediation.</p>
<p>(4) More than 30 employees of Guangdong cuisine restaurants such as Hongmian started a strike yesterday morning and will submit a request to the Social Bureau for mediation today.</p>

The capital side only agreed to 10,000 yuan. The labor side demanded that they sign immediately and set a date for work to begin, but the capital side refused to sign firmly, and the stalemate continued until late at night.</p>

They will depart from the United States soon and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in early February. It is said that they will first study the specific plan for the new Shanghai urban design, and the relevant agencies in the city are preparing research materials.</p>

<p>When the US first bombed Tokyo, the bombing squadron led by General Doolittle, when returning to the Chinese base, was lost and several Allied aircraft mistakenly landed in the Japanese-occupied area, and several American pilots were captured and killed by the enemy. After the victory, the 14th Air Force specially sent Lieutenant Colonel Handlong and Lieutenant De Weir to China to investigate the Japanese war criminals who murdered American airmen and submitted them to the military law office of the US Air Force in China for trial. It is heard that there are 23 names on their blacklist, 18 of whom are criminals who murdered three American pilots in Hankou on December 16, 1944, and were escorted from Hankou to Shanghai a month ago. As for Colonel Okada Ryuhei of the Army, who was arrested by the US and our military often in the Jiangwan Japanese prisoner concentration camp on the 24th of this month, it is learned that he is the principal offender who murdered the American pilots who mistakenly landed in the Japanese-occupied area after returning from the first bombing of Tokyo in the 31st year of the Republic of China. Lieutenant Colonel Handlong personally went to Tokyo, Nanjing and other places to investigate Okada's arrest, which lasted for more than a month before he was captured in Shanghai. It is heard that the US military court will formally open trial against Okada in the shortest possible time, and the other four Japanese war criminals who murdered the American airmen are still being investigated and arrested.</p>

<p>Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner Cheng Zhonghang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before after inspecting various counties in Jiangnan. Yesterday, this reporter visited Commissioner Cheng to inquire about his impressions of the trip. Commissioner Cheng replied: Although the various counties in Jiangnan are gradually moving away from the wartime period, the suffering of the people is beyond what those who have not experienced it firsthand can imagine. The focus of this inspection was the freedom of the people. Therefore, in each place, he first checked the places where people were detained. All kinds of malpractices were exposed immediately, like finding things according to a map, with nowhere to hide. Today, the priority for local administration is maintaining public order, and in terms of politics, it is to promote the Five-Power Constitution and establish public opinion organs as soon as possible. The administration of each county must be thoroughly reorganized, and the selection of county magistrates should be strictly reviewed and clarified. He has already filed impeachment requests for the dismissal or punishment of the following officials: Fan Tisheng, Magistrate of Wuxi County; Ding Songcai, Magistrate of Zhenjiang County; Zuo Fei, Chief of the Wuxi County Police Bureau; and Li Depu, Director of Revenue for Wuxi County. The various accusations received along the way are still being investigated and sorted out.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] Recently, labor unrest has been rampant, often with unnatural developments. According to a reporter's investigation, a certain absurd notice was discovered in the industrial area the day before yesterday, instigating workers to petition and receive money and flour everywhere. The concentration of workers petitioning the municipal government the day before yesterday, and the subsequent destruction of the Fourth District Textile Industry Union yesterday, were all due to workers receiving anonymous notices beforehand and acting accordingly. Yesterday, the General Post Office suddenly received a bizarre phone call stating that all post office branches would go on strike starting tomorrow, causing widespread inquiries at various branches. This phenomenon is clearly the result of planned instigation by unscrupulous villains, seriously affecting social stability and deserving close attention.</p>

<p>Wang Guangbi, a native of Haimen who lives at No. 10, Lane 208, Yaozhu Road, and runs a grocery business, was visited by Tan Yingjie, a native of Jiangxi dressed in a Zhongshan suit, carrying a gun, and claiming to be a plainclothes officer from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, along with six or seven accomplices, who claimed to be ordered to arrest a person surnamed Sheng. Wang immediately reported to the Xujiahui Police Branch, led by Chief Chen, who dispatched judicial section chief Chen Kaizhou and patrol officer Ma Yiqiu with plainclothes officers to the address. They arrested Tan Yingjie on the spot, along with Wang Youqi, Shen Minggan, and Wang Youqi's relative, Chen Baokang (all natives of Haimen), who was cooking in Wang Guangbi's house. A pistol without a permit and nine bullets were found on Tan's person, and five gold rings of unknown origin were found on Wang Youqi's person. All were taken back for questioning. Chief Chen, seeing that the suspects had no identification and no documents proving they were public officials, and were impersonating public officials, prepared a document and sent them to the District Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The High Court's Special Criminal Tribunal Publicly Tried Li Ze Yesterday, Awaiting Further Evidence Before a Retrial is Proposed <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court's Special Criminal Tribunal at Tilanqiao publicly tried Li Ze. The audience consisted mostly of employees from the New New Company and other department stores, totaling about 200 people. Li Ze's children were also brought by his sister. At 2:30 PM, Li's lawyers Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shizhao arrived together. At 2:45 PM, Judge Liu Yugui, the presiding judge, and Associate Judges Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, as well as Prosecutor Dai Yiduo, arrived at the same time. The bailiffs brought Li Ze in. Li had changed into a blue silk cotton robe and looked quite well. His tone was also calm and forceful during his defense.</p>
<p>The Tribunal Examines the Process of Serving in a Puppet Position</p>
<p>After the Prosecutor read the indictment, the judge first asked Li Ze about his involvement with the puppet Merchants' Association. Li replied that the Merchants' Association was a forced puppet organization, with initiators designated by the puppet Ministry of Industry. The directors and supervisors were the initiators, and authority was concentrated in the chairman. He was only nominally a director, never participated in actual work, and only occasionally attended meetings, without expressing any opinions. The transportation allowance he received was 7,000 puppet yuan in the first year, later increased to 8,000 yuan, and finally 15,000 yuan, all of which were distributed to colleagues in the company, as evidenced by public notices. After the testimony, lawyer Chen Tingrui stood up and stated that although the defendant admitted to being a director of the puppet Merchants' Association, it was indeed under duress, as evidenced by documents: (1) a letter from the director of the Ministry of Industry's Hong Kong Office to Li, asking him to serve as an initiator; (2) a letter from Mei Siping, the puppet Minister of Industry, summoning the initiators of the puppet Merchants' Association on March 11, 1943, which also proves that Li's participation in the association was not voluntary. After examining the two letters, the judge asked Li Ze about the sale of over 30,000 catties of steel pipes to the enemy. Li replied that he sold them to the Sen Da Iron Factory, and the subsequent use of the pipes was Sen Da's responsibility.</p>
<p>Reasons for Selling Steel Pipes Are Explained</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen then made two points: (1) Jin Zongcheng introduced the purchase of the steel pipes by Sen Da, and Jin's business card was presented to the court, requesting that he be questioned; (2) the puppet Shanghai District Court replied to an inquiry from the Merchants' Association stating that there were no explicit restrictions on the movement of hardware and steel at that time. Li also stated the reasons for selling the steel pipes: (1) he feared they would be confiscated by the Japanese, so he sold them in advance; (2) the city was frequently bombed, and power outages were common, so he sold the pipes to install generators. Lawyer Chen specifically mentioned two points: (1) New New Company was not the only one selling steel pipes at that time; (2) the hiring of a Japanese advisor had both immediate and long-term reasons. The long-term reason was that in 1937, the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published a large article stating that New New Company would be sold to the Japanese for 30,000 yuan. New New Company immediately published a rebuttal, so after the Japanese entered the concession, it was even more necessary to hire a Japanese representative to deal with them. Testimony of Plaintiff Shu Yueqiao and Others</p>
<p>Shu Yueqiao was then asked if he had any personal grudges against Li, to which he replied: Absolutely no personal grudges, his accusation was solely for the sake of the nation. He stated how the Merchants' Association's work involved searching for materials and exploiting the people for the enemy, and that the steel pipes were transported away by Japanese military trucks, as witnessed by many. Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, and Yao Zhuoren then testified, their statements similar to Shu Yueqiao's. At that point, the matter of the Merchants' Association was temporarily concluded. To ascertain the whereabouts of the steel pipes, the former general affairs director of New New Company and the three representatives of Sen Da Iron Factory, Han Zhiming, Han Zhi, and Chuan Jihe, were summoned, bringing account books to the court. After much examination and questioning, both sides gave similar testimony. The total was 369 bundles and 70 and a half catties of steel pipes, at a price of 5,600 puppet yuan per load, totaling 2,070,348 yuan. The payment was made in three installments.</p>
<p>More Evidence to be Presented Next Time</p>
<p>As the court was about to adjourn, lawyer Chen stated that the defendant's side had more evidence to present next time, which would not only prove that his service in the puppet position was forced, but also that the defendant had done work beneficial to the resistance during the period when the city was occupied. (Note: Li Ze took two letters from his pocket while Shu Yueqiao was testifying and handed them to lawyer Chen. One was a letter from a certain Yuan of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army to Li, and the other was a letter from a certain organization asking him to provide food and supplies when the National Army recovered Shanghai.) The court ordered him to collect the evidence quickly and present it at the next hearing. Li Ze wanted to speak again, but the judge stopped him, instructing him to present it all at the next hearing, and then adjourned.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The High Court's Criminal Tribunal tried Shi Xikun yesterday morning, accused of serving as an informant for the enemy consulate in Shanghai, forcing residents in western Shanghai to hang enemy flags, and arresting the patriotic worker Li Wenlong. Associate Judge Cao Jun questioned him, but the defendant denied the charges, stating that he ran a hardware store called Xin Tai Xiang in Shanghai and had always been law-abiding. Witnesses Xu Jianyuan and others testified in court. The court ordered the investigation to continue, and the trial was postponed.</p>
<p>Sentencing Today for Six Traitors</p>
<p>Six cases of traitors will be sentenced this afternoon, including: (1) Fang Zude, driver for the enemy Wusong Military Police; (2) Zhang Jingen, foreman at the enemy Jiading field warehouse; (3) Zou Wenxian, translator for the enemy pacification squad in Baoshan County, and Shi Huiyao, captain of the puppet guard team; (4) Shen Zhangming and Shen Zhaokui, informants for the enemy Showa Island naval unit; (5) Han Shaolin, petty officer third class in the puppet navy; (6) Wang Shiliang, informant for the enemy Pudong Military Police.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian Inspects the Shanghai City Defense Corps</p>
<h3 id="e59">Four Thousand City Defenders Held a Grand Review Yesterday, Mayor Qian and Others Offered Much Encouragement <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Over four thousand members of the City Defense Corps, who had been organized and trained, held a grand review at the Garrison Headquarters parade ground at 2:30 PM yesterday. Committee Director Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Directors Deputy Commander Li and Director Xuan Tiewu, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai served as reviewing officers. Commander Rong Youlue and Deputy Commander Zhang Jintang personally directed the review. Mayor Qian, wearing a grass-green woolen uniform, inspected the entire field to the sound of military music. The officials were full of spirit. Mayor Qian gave a speech on the spot, first stating that the members were all people with legitimate occupations and considerable education, and that they were worthy of praise for fulfilling their obligations to maintain public order in Shanghai and protect the lives and property of citizens. However, upon joining the corps, they become soldiers and must strictly abide by military discipline, obey the orders of superiors, and complete their mission. The organization of the Defense Corps is to supplement the insufficient strength of the military and police. They must abide by the orders of superiors, serve diligently, and the Defense Corps, as the self-defense force of the people, should stand united with the people and cooperate effectively.

<h3 id="e64">Gold Prices Rise Sharply, Breaking Through the Million Mark, Major Players Achieve Squeeze Goal <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold received broad support from large buyers. Actual sales at silver shops were unusually brisk due to exchanges from rural areas. Speculators bought gold to replenish their capital chips due to settlement relationships. Major players in the industry originally intended to squeeze, but with this multi-faceted assistance, they were triumphant. The opening was flat, and initially, it was stable. However, with silver shops continuously collecting to meet demand, prices gradually improved from 965,000. Although there were minor twists and turns along the way, the situation became increasingly favorable. Major players in the industry encouraged from the sidelines, and credit also eased. Small investors were fearless, and eventually, prices broke through the million mark. At this point, there was some profit-taking at high levels, hovering around the million mark for a time. When the million mark was firmly established and not broken, old shorts such as the Northern Gang and Shantou Gang, as well as those pledging securities, were panicked. Squeezing forces, the market price broke away and could not be stopped, and by noon it was approaching 1.05 million. After that, silver shops posted high prices up to 1.15 million, and the gold market presented a squeeze and search for supply simultaneously. In the afternoon, prices broke through 1.1 million again, seeing a new high of 1.15 million, before slightly correcting, falling to 1.08 million. The situation was extremely chaotic, leading to the small market accompanying next-day delivery. The difference between spot transaction buying and selling prices was extremely far, making it difficult to find proper bidding. Until around 4:00 PM, the bidding price was around 1.12 million, an increase of over 150,000 compared to the previous close. Silver shops posted high prices up to 120,000 at noon, later bidding at 180,000. Fine silver was 1,000 yuan, and silver dollars rose to over 650 yuan. Secret discounts eased slightly in the morning but suddenly became more expensive in the afternoon, with daily discounts of 1.2 to 1.5 yuan, and over the New Year's period from 1.5 to 1.8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rumor that the new foreign exchange rate had been decided and was about to be announced spread widely in the city market. The news spread, and the market was quite agitated, with prices for all items rising uniformly and rapidly. Chen Hang, Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Beijing-Shanghai region, solemnly stated to the press that the above rumors were purely fabrications by speculators and were absolutely untrue.</p>

<p>U.S. dollars, stimulated by the gold market, continued to rise. The opening price in the morning was 1,480 yuan, and it broke through the 1,500 mark under hedging purchases. At noon, it hovered around 1,550 yuan. With gold prices continuing to jump wildly, it broke through the 1,600 and 1,700 marks again. The hedging price against gold was consistently above 650 yuan per ten taels, peaking at 670 yuan. However, after seeing the high price of 1,700 yuan, many began to sell, and in extreme chaos, it briefly fell back below 1,600. Finally, it hovered around 1,650 yuan, a sharp increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also affected by the gold market and pulled up significantly. Old bills rose by 30 yuan, and new bills also increased by 11 yuan, but these were all selling prices. Bidding was chaotic, and it was difficult to find a match.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Public Debt Fluctuations Were Numerous, But the Result Was a Higher Close Than Before <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, most firms dealing with public debt took a holiday, and transaction volume was limited. Class C briefly approached the 2,000 mark in the morning but was suppressed by debt sales to buy gold, falling to 1,800 yuan. After that, it hovered somewhat, struggling slightly around 1,880 yuan at noon. The results at the noon close were as follows compared to the previous close: Class A and B up 240 yuan each, Class C up 180 yuan, Class D up 260 yuan, and Class E up 270 yuan. This was due to seasoned players releasing their holdings, with Class C showing a weaker upward trend.</p>

<p>China stocks yesterday inherited the afterglow of the previous close, rising immediately upon market opening. However, major investors conserved their strength, hoping to unleash it within profitable territory. Therefore, the process didn't appear overly tense, and a dip was even observed mid-session. At noon, stimulated by the gold market, buyers came again to pull up prices. Except for Yung Spinning, which was affected by dumping from American-Asian interests and didn't reach high prices, all other stocks closed at high prices. Some mobile capital selected undervalued stocks to acquire, leading to substantial increases in neglected stocks. Those familiar with popular stocks found themselves falling behind. The midday close saw Yung Spinning up by slightly less than 100 yuan from the previous close. American-Asian, with prices lower than Yung Spinning, was sought after, jumping by 220 yuan. The "Three Small Hots" each rose by slightly less than 10%. Neglected stocks rose by 10% to 15%. In the afternoon, small-cap stocks continued to be bid higher.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks yesterday saw buyers bidding up odd-lot shares, which were immediately caught up. The process involved fluctuation. The midday close resulted in Yih Spinning rising by 200 yuan, Wheelock Marden rising by a good 900 yuan, and Steel Union and British Union each rising by 100-200 yuan compared to the previous day. Small-cap stocks such as Yih Brewery, Paper Industry, and Yeh Kwong rose slightly, around 5%.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Cotton Fabric Thriving <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>As gold prices repeatedly reach new peaks, the cotton fabric market, influenced by the trend, instills confidence in both factories and merchants. Factories adjust prices tighter, while merchants increase their purchasing efforts. Transactions are rare, but there are reports of dyeing and weaving factories urgently replenishing supplies of unbleached fine cloth, almost indiscriminately, because they need to urgently produce light-colored khaki drill.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Since the restoration, the Sichuan guild has recovered to its pre-war prosperity, transporting a large quantity of goods, with cotton yarn and cloth being the most prominent. However, there have traditionally been regulations such as silver tax, which impose significant demands. Therefore, after discussion among the dyeing and weaving industry association, it was decided that a fee of 2 jiao per thousand yuan of goods value would be subsidized for the silver tax demanded by the Sichuan guild. As for inspection fees and warehouse fees, since goods are declared and transported by customers, they should be handled by the customers themselves. Notices have been sent to the cotton cloth and yarn industry associations to assist in joint handling.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trading of spot cotton was virtually at a standstill, but sentiment continued to be bullish. The spot market for yarn and cloth was closed due to year-end preparations for settling accounts, and the positive news regarding gold prices was rampant. As a result, those holding goods demanded even higher prices. Factories, also, due to several days of work stoppage during the holiday, had no urgent need. They all waited to purchase after reopening. Only Flower brands saw some trading in Zhoupu seed cotton at a price of 9,800 yuan delivered to the warehouse, an increase of another 300 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>The price of Zhongsha sugar had previously loosened to 36,000-37,000 yuan in off-market trading. However, since only a few followed the price decline to sell, and due to strong rumors regarding Sun Yat-sen banknotes, the price tightened again, now re-entering the 40,000 yuan range.</p>

<p>Due to the year's end, tea merchants are eager to handle settlement accounts, so trading is minimal. Occasional transactions occur, mostly between small retailers and local shops. Regarding prices, those holding goods are unwilling to liquidate excessively. Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places still have demand for various types of green tea, but activity will likely resume after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Western medicines rise along with gold prices, with the increases being quite substantial. This is especially true for saccharin and quinine. For other items such as Bayer products, the price appears stable, as the Bayer Pharmaceuticals Liquidation Office continues to distribute goods.</p>
<p>The Defu Foreign Firm Liquidation Office has completed its survey of dyeing and weaving factories and issued allocation notices, informing the recipient manufacturers to pay and collect warehouse receipts in preparation for delivery. Merchant buying activities have subsided, and prices have stabilized.</p>

<p>Lime prices... (missing data) Brick prices rose over 10,000 yuan per ten thousand bricks, and lime prices rose 200-300 yuan per load.</p>
<p>Longans are becoming less common, while sellers are collecting more goods, so the price is slightly tighter. Yesterday's market rose 1,000 yuan to 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for knitted goods saw prices rise in response to the gold price stimulus, and those holding goods were generally unwilling to sell. Those wanting to buy could not find them anywhere.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Zhu Jingnong, Political Vice Minister of Education, came to Beijing on official business on the 26th. Our reporter stationed in Beijing visited him. After an eight-year absence, we were surprised at how much he had aged. During our conversation, we learned that the Ministry of Education reported three points regarding the rehabilitation work of various schools:</p>
<p>School Restoration Around the Summer Break</p>
<p>(1) All universities and colleges that moved inland will strive to move back to their respective locations for restoration. However, due to factors such as distance, school buildings, and transportation costs, the restoration period will vary. It is expected that it will be completed around the summer break. Secondary schools in various localities, which were taken over by the national government for wartime relief, will naturally be returned to the management of the local governments after rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Restoring Universities that Were Shut Down</p>
<p>(2) The universities that were shut down during the War of Resistance are now preparing for restoration, including universities and the rehabilitation of Beijing Normal University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Business School, all of which are in separate preparation plans. (3) Promoting new planned education. The Ministry of Education's first five-year implementation plan for education, formulated during the War of Resistance, has already been implemented in the interior for the national education stage.</p>
<p>Promoting National Education</p>
<p>Currently, promotion is also being urged in the recovered areas. Provinces and cities in the interior that have already implemented the first plan will continue with the second five-year plan starting from January of this year. Those that have not yet implemented it, such as the newly recovered Taiwan, will create the first five-year plan for implementation, in order to achieve the goal of establishing a central national school in every township, a national school in every bao (a local administrative unit), and implementing six years of compulsory education in primary schools. Regarding the promotion of education at all levels after the war, in addition to national education, which has been successfully implemented in the interior, the recovered areas will follow suit and move quickly to catch up. Gradual implementation plans will also be formulated for secondary education, higher education, and social education.</p>
<p>Such as Opening an Education Conference</p>
<p>It is heard that a national education conference will be convened this year to discuss many important issues in education. It is also heard that Vice Minister Hang Liwu plans to go to Chongqing on official business in early February. During Vice Minister Hang's absence from Beijing, Vice Minister Zhu will work in Beijing. Vice Minister Hang will return before Vice Minister Zhu goes.</p>

<h3 id="e87">The Beginning of the Year <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>"A year's plan starts in spring" is a very old saying, but at the beginning of each year, we always use this sentence to remind and encourage ourselves.</p>
<p>In general families, things get very busy when the Spring Festival arrives. However, very few people can calmly discuss the year's plans at this time. In fact, determining the year's plan is more important than socializing.</p>
<p>The Spring Festival is the beginning of the first lunar month. Usually, we have already switched to using the Gregorian calendar and no longer need to use the lunar calendar. However, due to farming, we still have places where we use the lunar calendar. Therefore, in certain contexts, it is called the agricultural calendar.</p>
<p>Speaking of the agricultural calendar, it makes us think of cultivation. If we want to have a prosperous harvest, we must first ask ourselves if we have worked hard to complete our cultivation work. Farmers will be busy this spring. Everyone in our family should also set their specific plans this spring.</p>
<p>We should not only seek temporary happiness or temporary busyness; we should seek constant happiness and constant busyness. Constant effort.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Is Your Child Naughty? <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Speaking of children, mothers often shake their heads helplessly and say, "That one in our family is simply hopeless. He's naughty all day long. As soon as you let go of something, he'll take it apart for you. He's endlessly unreasonable... Scolding is useless, it's like the wind in his ears. The adults are mad at him, but he still goes off to be unreasonable again."</p>
<p>Yes, children are quite disobedient. They want to be naughty and don't understand whether they're bothering the adults. When they hold something in their hands, as long as it's fun, they don't care if it's important to you or not. When the interest comes, they only know to keep playing, and they don't understand that this causes "destruction." This kind of play is bound to cause the adults to hit and scold. In fact, mothers, take a calm look and see if this isn't an expression of exploring knowledge!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, children are rarely seen and isolated in their knowledge. Anything they see for the first time is sacred and novel. They want to understand why it's made up of such a shape and substance. They want to understand where the novelty lies. Therefore, the way they explore these questions, in the eyes of adults, is often thought of as a kind of "destruction." Most psychologists advocate that if a child can take apart a watch, it's best to give him a second one, and don't hit or scold him, because that would stop his curiosity. Everyone agrees that only the urging of curiosity can lead to further understanding, and his talent can be fully developed. The expression of a child's talent is even more unreserved when he's being naughty.</p>
<p>Children not only love to be naughty, but also love to meddle in things. They often ask inexplicable questions about a certain thing or a certain item. But mothers sometimes ignore them or give them a fantastic and absurd answer. This kind of indifferent attitude is the worst thing you can do to a child, especially to children aged four or five to teens whose knowledge is just beginning to open up.</p>
<p>Children not only need to understand, but also need to understand correctly, so that they have a basic concept. Don't think that once children enter school, all the responsibility for education is handed over to the teachers at school. Honestly, what they read in books and what the teachers teach them is not necessarily their biggest question, let alone their biggest interest. And what they most want answered are often some small things that adults think are trivial, or what they think are inexplicable nonsense. For example, they ask: How many stars are there in the sky? What is sugarcane made of? Why don't we have a snowfall in the summer so we can make some ice cream?</p>
<p>Their questions are the most eager expression of education. They remember what you answer the most, and the impression is the deepest. If you are impatient or give them an absurd answer without thinking, they will believe it completely without any doubt. If you reject them, they may never bring up the question again. A casual interest, once gone, is not easily returned. As for harshly stopping their questions with stern words, that is equivalent to prohibiting them from seeking knowledge. Parents should have a correct and interesting answer to their children's questions, and generously apply some fertilizer along with their imagination. The purpose of adding fertilizer is to correctly develop their talents.</p>

<h3 id="e89">A Happy Spirit <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>To make family life beautiful and happy, we must first possess a happy spirit. This happy spirit can be generated from accurate viewpoints and optimistic attitudes. We must first possess this accurate viewpoint, and then start from nearby, step by step, and then our ideal can become reality, and at the same time, a smile will appear on our faces.</p>
<p>With a happy spirit, we will have a kind of cordial feeling when we treat people, and there will be no hypocritical dignity. So that when anyone sees us, it is as if they have seen their closest friend.</p>
<p>Due to this kind of happy spirit, a valuable demeanor can be produced. By interacting with people with this demeanor, one can achieve the state of "all within the four seas are brothers."</p>
<p>Germany has several famous philosophers: Kant was a hesitant figure, Schopenhauer was a misogynistic bachelor, and Nietzsche was also a psychologically conflicted person. They did not have a happy spirit, so their actions were perverse, their thoughts could not meet the needs of the general public, and they could not live a normal life.</p>
<p>So from now on, let us generate a happy spirit to lay the foundation for building a modern family.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The First Day in the Ward <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Chuang</p>
<p>Even after being admitted to nursing school, one still has to go through a month and a half of probation. This period is entirely devoted to lectures and has no contact with the hospital. Even our uniforms are just a blue cloth smock and white caps and white shoes. During this period, we lived all day in two large classrooms in the basement. One classroom was full of skeletons, eyeballs, big ears, and other toy-like specimens and models, with various human body charts hanging on the walls. This is where we listened to lectures. The other room was a practice room, decorated like a ward, with white beds, white sheets, white cabinets, and white screens. Everything was white, plus two oilcloth patients lying there, at least two sizes larger than ourselves, because they were shipped from abroad, with yellow hair and blue eyes. They were used for practice, such as washing their faces, feeding them, giving enemas, etc. Once, we were having a Chinese class in there. The new teacher shook his head and softly recited a Tang poem, and gently asked, "Will it disturb them!" We said, "No." He seemed to suddenly understand and said, "Oh, they are foreigners."</p>
<p>Six weeks passed, and we had only one-third of the students left. Some were in poor health, some couldn't keep up with the coursework, and a few quit halfway due to lack of courage. On the first morning of the seventh week, we changed into our new blue shirt and white skirt uniforms, went through a solemn graduation ceremony, and were led into different wards by supervising staff in groups. Our group consisted of four people. The ward was so clean, bright, and the air was solemn and quiet, with only the sound of running water, steam pots, and the clanging of porcelain basins when the utility room door was opened. Doctors and nurses were busily working like shuttles, but they were very calm and orderly. Our four new uniforms became the focus of their attention today, and the patients also opened their eyes to watch and whisper to each other. Especially the starched aprons, which rustled loudly as we walked, were even more restrictive, making it difficult to move. Perhaps because we were in an unfamiliar place, the ward seemed too wide and too open, with no place to hide. Two of us were naturally more "lively," and quickly mixed into the old team, while Cao and I were cautiously sticking together.</p>
<p>The red light came on, meaning a patient was calling. We looked at each other and ran towards the patient together. No one spoke, and the patient said, "No water." She held up the kettle, and I took the tray. When we got to the kitchen door, we remembered that patients' tableware could not be brought into the kitchen, so we backed away again, put down the kettle and tray, and found a large water container in the kitchen. One carried it, and the other followed. The patient next door called "Doctor." We both turned our heads back, and he said his pillow was uncomfortable. Cao raised his head and pulled the pillow down slightly. I saw bloodstains on the bandage under his neck, so I didn't dare to touch it. Cao was sent away by the supervisor. A patient by the balcony wanted to have a bowel movement. I went to get a bedpan, covered it with a piece of cloth, and set off from the utility room, which was quite a distance. Under the gaze of many eyes, I didn't know whether to hold it with both hands or carry it with one hand. The skirt rustled loudly, the hat seemed to fall, my knee joints stiffened, and then softened. I thought I was going to faint. I also tried my best to avoid the doctors, afraid that I wouldn't understand the terms they used, or that I wouldn't know what they were asking for.</p>
<p>Finally, the supervisor came. She took me to a single-person ward with a red sign on the door, meaning "isolation." I immediately held my breath and waited until I put on the mask. She helped me put on the isolation gown and said that this was a typhoid patient who was in critical condition, and asked me to do interval care for him. I tiptoed over and first took a look at him. His face was full of beard, his eyes were sunken, his eyebrows were tightly locked, he was abnormally thin, his mouth was slightly open, phlegm was stuck in his throat, and his breathing was very rough. I took off my watch, wrapped it in paper, and placed it on the windowsill nearby. While working, I memorized the unfamiliar work procedures and had to pay attention to the complicated isolation procedures, often hesitating and often forgetting. I was fortunate that this was a patient who was not very conscious and had no reaction, just like the dummy in the classroom, only heavier. I laboriously finished bathing him and changed the sheets. The kitchen sent a bowl of chicken soup. I reluctantly spooned two spoonfuls into him. The third time, the chicken soup flowed from the corner of his mouth, and he stopped swallowing. I wiped his mouth and tucked in the sheets. He slept more quietly than before, relaxed his eyebrows, and there was no more phlegm.</p>
<p>A nurse came with a tray to wash his eyes. She went out without putting down the tray. Then a group of doctors and a suction machine came in. They put one end of the tube into the patient's mouth, and the machine whirred. A fat foreign doctor made a stop gesture, and the room was suddenly silent. A young doctor by the bed lifted the patient's buttocks, a pool of blood. They said some foreign words in a low voice that I couldn't understand and went out. I seemed to hear "bleeding"... "bath"... "student." The last one turned back and glared at me.</p>
<p>I stood blankly not far from the door. It seemed like a long, long time before the supervisor came and said, "What do you want?" Her voice was very gentle, almost making me cry. "There's still a watch." "A watch?" "Inside," I pointed to the small room. She understood, smiled, ran in, and very casually took my watch from the windowsill next to the dead man's head. I was taken out of the ward and had a cup of hot coffee in her office. "Go off work," she still said gently. Not understanding, she said, "Time's up."</p>
<p>I knew the time was not up, but I quickly ran back to the dormitory and took several baths in a row. That night, I felt feverish and uncomfortable all over. I saw a face full of beard, a pool of blood. I heard "student"... "bath"... "bleeding"....</p>

<h3 id="e92">Women in the Soviet Union <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Huijuan</p>
<p>Ms. Pearl Binder, an American, has lived in Russia for many years and has a deep understanding of Russian women. She has written many books about Russian customs and sentiments, all of which have been praised. The following is a detailed description of her view on the lives of Russian women.</p>
<p>The status of Russian women is equal to that of men, because their work and life are not entirely limited to the family. In the past few years, although the Soviet Union vigorously encouraged childbirth due to population needs, the duties of women have never been confined to the family. In addition to managing the family, women also engage in social work, hold government positions, participate in various industries, and work as musicians, painters, architects, engineers, etc. Women participate in everything, and men talk to women about everything. A famous saying of Lenin is popular in Moscow: "Every cook must know how to rule Russia."</p>
<p>It seems impossible for women to have so many things to do in the family and at the same time hold outside jobs. There are several reasons why Russian women can do this. First, household affairs have become very simple with scientific evolution; second, social work has become very rationalized due to proper arrangements. Women work outside for a very short time. There are rest periods at noon, and they only work until four o'clock in the afternoon. Every sixth day, there is a day off. Even if there are many chores at home, they can be taken care of calmly.</p>
<p>At the same time, housework is also very simple: furniture is only a few simple pieces, which can be swept clean in a few minutes; every house has public gas, making cooking very convenient; groceries are pre-packaged. If you don't want to cook, you can buy ready-made dishes, carry them back in a three-layer pot. Usually, everyone eats in the public dining hall. Children are taken care of by nurseries, so adults don't have to worry about them all the time. If the housework is really too busy, you can hire a helper. This kind of helper is called a "domestic worker" (Domestice Worker). They don't wear uniforms, just wear an apron. Their educational level is relatively low, so while they work for you, you also have the obligation to teach them to read.</p>
<p>Some people think that children in such socialized families will not be taken care of properly, and that families will lose a lot of fun. In fact, this view is not very correct. There are no drawbacks to children being cared for by nurseries, because those engaged in this social work have twenty-five years of history. Because many heavy and unnecessary tasks have been eliminated, women can use their spare time to engage in various more meaningful entertainment and self-cultivation. The food in the public dining hall is also very delicious, and eating is not limited to the dining hall. Usually, breakfast is always at home, and afternoon tea is also prepared at home.</p>
<p>Even if women go out to work, it varies from person to person and is not forced. Guiding women to serve the public is also a matter of measuring their talents and providing facilities, using a gradual approach. For example, some women don't like to leave their families. She likes cooking, and her cooking skills are very good, so she can be allowed to cook more dishes and taught to serve in public canteens. Some women don't like to leave home. She prefers to take care of children, and she has a special love for children, so she can be allowed to take care of more children and taught to work in nurseries.</p>
<p>Some people also think that women going out to work will infringe on men's "territory" and will be resented by men. But in the Soviet Union, this phenomenon does not exist. Men have plenty of work and plenty of professions for them to do, so they don't have to worry about women taking their business away. At the same time, they can clearly understand that there is still much work in society that needs women to cooperate with them.</p>
<p>Have Soviet women become rough and vulgar and lost their feminine beauty because they work outside? (Indeed, many people may worry about this when talking about women working outside.) Soviet women still maintain their feminine beauty and maintain their feminine charm, but they do not regard beauty as a woman's only task. The lives of Soviet women are extensive and active, because their lives are not limited to the family.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The True Meaning of Family <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>A family is a group formed by emotions, where parents love each other and love their children, extending to every member of the family; at the same time, they promote and enhance true love, so that the young can obtain security and guidance.</p>
<p>In the family, we can enjoy quiet and life, obtain a sense of peace and joy, and engage in proper recreation by ourselves or with others; we can preserve our private property and dispose of it in accordance with our individual styles; and cultivate all the beautiful habits, language, and character to pass on to our children. In the family, we can also produce human mutual love, loyalty, honesty, and other good character traits.</p>
<p>So a family can really be said to be a paradise, a holy land, and a source that inspires our souls.</p>

<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>Last issue I talked about how to make a small pug. Today I will introduce how to make a half-length cloth doll bag.</p>
<p>The half-length cloth doll bag is similar to the kind of cloth doll we used to see that held sweets. It can not only hold sweets, but also be used as decoration for children to play with. You can make it with leftover scraps of material.</p>
<p>To make a half-length cloth doll bag, follow the diagram on the left, determine the size of the cloth, follow the dotted lines to sew the body and bottom together to form a cylinder, leave an opening in the back, make it hollow in the middle, and then sew the face (using white cloth) according to the dotted lines, stuff it with cotton (the side of the face that is exposed should be flat), sew the bottom end tight, then sew the hat on the head and sew it tightly to the body (make the cape and body as a sandwich), sew the arms together, stuff them with cotton, and then place them as shown in the diagram (lower left). Draw on the features, tie a ribbon around the neck, then tie a silk rope to the end of the hat, and you can hang it on the dressing table or on a small bed. It can hold cotton gauze, sweets, etc., which is much better-looking than an ordinary pocket.</p>
<p>If you have lace, embroider some edges around the clothes of the small cloth doll, which will be even more beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Song <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>I think that the folk songs circulating in Chinese society have indelible value. The following one fully exposes the irrationality of traditional Chinese families and the need for transformation:</p>
<p>"Rose blooms every month, the mother-in-law scolds the daughter-in-law as a dead slave. Good food and clothing are not to be had, beating and scolding come from time to time. The slave did not run in from the front door, but slipped in from the back door. The family asked the matchmaker to get me, the family asked the matchmaker to get me. Four people carried the fancy sedan chair, the flag bearers and umbrella holders set off cannons. The eldest brother carried me into the sedan chair, and the younger brother sent me to the City God Temple. Today it is so indifferent, back then it was so lively!"</p>
<p>In this folk song, we can see the disharmony between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in Chinese families. We certainly cannot say that the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in general families is like fire and water, but in most families, conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law can occur at any time.</p>
<p>How can we reduce friction and maintain affection between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law? Only by starting from "mutual understanding." If both parties can "forgive each other," then naturally they will not "nitpick" with each other, leading to "arguing back"!</p>
