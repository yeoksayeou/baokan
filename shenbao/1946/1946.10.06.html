<h3>國大準備積極進行各項代表大半產生　各黨派名單已在催辦中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國大召集令二日未如期頒發，政府方面爲斟酌盡善，日來正在硏商中，二日晨吳鐵城·張厲生·陳立夫·邵力子·雷震·洪蘭友等·在中央黨部二樓集會，對此問題談至十二時始畢，會後拒發任何意見。據記者探悉，根據國大組織法規，僅規定國大由國民政府召集之，而無召集日期之訂定，其次對代表報到時期，亦僅定爲十日以前，是故如根據組織法規召集令即延至十一月一日頒發亦未嘗不可。唯前定五五開會時召集令則係於三月廿五日頒發，定四月廿五日報到，故如以上决爲例，目前實已爲期迪促，然時局如斯，政府是否將採取次一步驟，目前尙在考慮中。據國大選舉主管機關負責人談，各項代表大半均已產生，各黨派名單，已在催辦中。有人謂可能在十月十二日發召集令，並如期舉行開幕式，然後再暫停開會，待國是解決再行開會，惟此項辦法是否可行，現尙未悉。又據聞主席爲鄧重此項民憲初步之國民大會，日來對此亦極關懷。</p>
<p>頒布國大召集令　十二日前可決定</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕洪蘭友四日談，國大召集令頒布期，十二日前必可確定，關於國大候補代表，要求列席事，洪謂將由國大主席團決定，惟在組織法上，無候補代表之規定。</p>

<h3>察省東南部激戰　傅作義電告收復南壕塹　陳誠在平召開軍事會議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕察省戰事，東南部迄五日午止仍在懷來城東五里左右無子營，馬圈子，火燒營，辛莊一帶激戰中。國軍二日即到達此地帶，與共軍演拉鋸戰已四日，相當酷烈，顯示共軍之堅守張垣決心。國軍另自南口分兵一路北上，現與共軍在延慶南廿華里地帶激戰。懷來一帶共軍的三十個團，三萬餘人，由聶榮臻親自指揮，其番號爲冀察畏江兩總隊，此外，共軍更於南口，昌平東北一帶增兵六個團，企圖擾亂後方。另據傅作義昨致此間關係方面電稱：騎兵團於一日收復察西南壕塹，繼續前進中。南壕塹屬商都，爲此次戰役必爭之地，據某此次在察省指揮作戰之軍事家稱：根據過去作戰經騐，該路國軍可能趨萬全，萬全一下可居高臨下，直撲張垣。過去之爭取張垣，亦皆取道於此，故由此路取張垣，將較他路爲速，軍事當局並稱，察西進展過速，可能影饗察東之「會戰」。另據中共人談，共軍作戰向以沿「利害轉換錢」用兵爲原則，亦即避重就輕，不惜放棄據點，故察東大會戰如何，尙不可測但共軍主力配備於察東，則已明顯，共軍失張坦後退路問題，一般均謂將爲蔚縣以至台山一帶。陳總長之來平，將使察冀戰事早日結束。</p>

<h3>行總糧食調查團報告　饑饉威脅湘桂粵　全國需要救濟糧食八十餘萬噸</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕據行總糧食調查團報告稱：湘，桂，粵，三省，今冬仍面臨饑饉危機，今年全國糧食收成，較之承平時期，不足約一成左右，若干省內之糧食收成，不足有四成之多，水災與種籽，農具，肥料之缺乏，爲造成糧食歉收主要原因，預計全國將需要八十一萬二千噸之救濟糧食，以供應我國農民作渡過今冬及明春之用。根據目前之交通運量限度，行總與聯總至明春可供應食糧計五十五萬三千噸，較之全國糧食需要之總數尚缺少二十五萬噸，全國各地之糧食需要，除江西少數縣份之收成有餘剩外，其他如冀，熱，察，綏，台灣，東北九省，湘，豫，粵，桂，皖，鄂，浙，閩，蘇，等省，皆告不足，上海一地糧食需要估計即在四千噸左右。行總自開始工作以來，截至九月初，已分配予全國各地之糧食，共有五五九，四九二噸，至九月十五日止，聯總運至中國在各港口卸下之五二·〇〇·六一〇噸，由行總分配至各地或正在重行裝配。聯總運華之器械需要重行裝配者，包括約有八·一一一噸之農業機器，其中大部份農業機械牽引機。行總已將足供種植二百萬畝田地之一百萬磅種籽，分配與全國各地農民。其他有五十五萬二千磅之殺虫劑物資以及六四，一六九·〇〇〇磅之肥料，亦由行總分配與各地應用云。</p>
<h3>中國公司失事機　派機偵察無結果　普格倮倮人多方留難</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶五日電〕據今日此間接獲不甚詳細之消息，中國航空公司八一號機於十五日前在倮倮區曠野失事降落，機上人員及乘客於受驚之餘，並曾與倮倮人互相開火，中國公司刻已派運輸機前往營救，以便確定該機駕駛員龍巴頓及乘客等是否安全，惟昨日經偵察後，一無結果，中航營救機係由美籍司機波史米德駕駛，該機曾擲下長布條，上書中文及倮倮文，意謂如前在倮倮區失事飛機，其中人員仍有生存者，可發信號通知。倮倮人見狀，乃向飛機開槍，當擊中機尾，中航營救機駕駛員除波史米德外，尚有安德森，浮洛士得及考　斯　，　　斯曾以降落　自飛機跳下一千零九十八次，　計劃在必要時　躍入　　區，俾直接協助營救失事飛機，惟以今日視綫不清，又一無結果。關於中國公司飛機上人員及乘客與倮倮人開火一事，最初係由普格（西昌東南一八〇里）一鄉長名吳國建者之函中傳出，西昌代表警備司令賀國光已派員十七名，其中包括乘客家屬，天主教牧師及醫生等前往，但倮倮人僅允許兩人入境計倮倮人及賀氏所派人員各一人。據西昌賀氏來電稱：「失事機係落在阿步盧盧卜村，附近倮倮人甚且願盡力保護遇難諸人，請通知乘客家屬盡量送衣服，食　及醫藥用品」。倮倮人或可能欲以此爲釋放諸人代價，倮倮人彼此間積不相能，營救人員雖有倮倮人相伴，但亦不敢確保必能通過所有倮倮區而達到目的地。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>傳說中的三巨頭會議</h3>
<p>美國前商務部長華萊士演說，主張美國對蘇改變強硬的外交政策；史達林對記者談話，認爲目前世界不致有戰爭；英前外相艾登發表演說主張以新精神及新途徑與蘇聯修好，翌日史達林即表示歡迎；美國國務卿貝爾納斯在巴黎演說，主張訂立對德四十年和約；莫洛托夫於本月四日突然返國請示：有了這一連串的事實，英美蘇三巨頭會議之說，因此甚囂塵上。從這些發展看來，蘇聯和英美似乎雙方面都在努力改善目前對立的形勢。這是國際局勢中一個可喜的現象，而就中國立塲看來，更覺得符合我們的期望。</p>
<p>現在世界不能再有第三次大戰，這不但是全世界人民的要求，同時也是客觀事實的限制。所謂第三次大戰，最重要的國家當然是美蘇兩國。但是美國雖然富強，國內物價上漲，統制不能取消，工潮迭起，國內似呈不安之象。當政的人當然不願意戰爭，就算願意，此時也不容易克復美國人民反戰的情緒。只要看艾森豪威爾元帥最近演說，引證林肯所言，「槍彈不能解決問題」，就可窺見美國一般人的意見。至於蘇聯方面，無論原子彈是否發明，人民是否有權反戰，國內經濟拮据，重工業和農業均未復原。新五年計劃實行，方可希望四年以後能够替每人每年造一雙鞋子三雙襪子，目前則每人每年只有一雙襪子，隔一年才有一雙鞋子。從莫斯科到列寗格勒只有一條單綫的鐵道。集體農塲，弊賣叢生，最近已公布於報端。在這樣的國力之下，當局的人，無論怎樣，也未必即有征服世界的雄心。史達林元帥目前不會有戰爭的談話，我們深信其爲由衷之言。</p>
<p>美蘇事實上均不能戰，然而他們却不顧一切地在整軍經武，這是最矛盾的現象。美國因爲軍費預算龐大，對於國內民生問題不能全力改善；蘇聯大部分工廠不造急需的復員交通和農業的機器，而在造坦克·大砲·火箭·飛機，並且竭其全力以研究原子彈的製造方法。麺包分配制度不敢取消，爲的要保存不時之需的軍糧。美蘇雖然沒有正式戰爭，然而這種準戰爭的形勢已經使本國人民生計陷於痛苦之境。</p>
<p>這種可慮局面的造成，固然要歸咎於彼此疑懼的心理，同時國際間確實存在着幾個有重要爭執而不能解決的問題，也是很大的原因。第一是對德問題，第二是多瑙河開放問題，第三是特港問題，第四是韃靼尼爾海峽問題，第五是希臘內戰問題，第六是朝鮮統一問題。這些問題，都直接間接，使美蘇不能互信，不能合作，四外長會議不能解決，廿一國巴黎和會更不能解決。除非美蘇的最高當局，成立諒解，一切國際會議，樽俎折衝，似乎都不會產生完全滿意的結果。英美蘇三巨頭會議，杜魯門總統雖還不信短期內可成事實，但到今天恐怕是最急切的需要。因爲只有杜魯門史達林兩國元首開誠佈公，提出實際問題，加以適當的解決，理加上艾德禮調停其間，纔有真正解決的希望。</p>
<p>現在世界上有一些人，以爲共產主義的國家不能够和資本主義的國家在同一世界上存在，以爲他們必須要戰爭，至少必須要準備戰爭。但我們認爲這是一種成見，也是一種錯覺。現在所謂資本主義的國家，大多數都已經是民主國家，人民都有自由言論的機會。雖然少數資本集團具有相當操縱政治的力量，但是並不能够完全操縱，一到違反大多數人民的福利，他們也必定　台。前英國邱吉爾首相，以救國元勳，終於落選，就是明例。美國物價繼續統制，雖然許多資本家不樂意，終於維持。海員罷工也得到相當的勝利。而且就資本家立塲來說，除掉極少數的軍火商人而外，他們也一樣需要和平，只有和平，他們纔有生意可做。我們猜想，華萊士反對貝爾納斯政策最主要的動機，或者還是因爲他是商務部長，認爲貝爾納斯的對蘇政策存在一天，美蘇的貿易一天也許便沒有辦法發展。</p>
<p>至於共產主義的國家，大部分比資本主義的國家經濟還要貧乏，在戰爭殘破之後，更急需要和平來恢復生產。並且共產主義的本身並不是沒有彈性。現在的蘇聯社會，並不是當初布爾雪維克黨人理想的蘇聯社會。許多違反人性根本不能實行的理論，早已經逐步改變以遷就事實了。至於世界革命的企圖，他們雖然理論上沒有放棄，也許還在夢想實現，而在事實上不必諱言，確也曾經屢次放棄。只要革命時機並未成熟，客觀環境不能允許，蠻幹硬幹只有促成革命的失敗與自身的崩潰。克林姆營十四位領袖，都是極精明的人，何嘗不知？他們表面上雖然堅決不肯讓步，其實也必顧慮多端，在適當條件之下；他們未見得不肯走上暫時妥協之路。</p>
<p>由國際現勢言，三巨頭會議是「可以」打開僵局的，而且這個僵局也「必須」要打開，因爲各方面都有迫切的需要。我們希望史達林杜魯門和艾德禮，看清目前迫切的需要，用坦白的態度，採取切實的步驟，來安定目前這個擾攘的世界。</p>
<h3>中共究欲何爲？</h3>
<p>最近中共問題的商談，初相持於「三」「五」之爭，時局陷於極度的沉悶。蔣主席返京以後，政府表示五人會議與三人小組可同時召開，首都乃有樂觀的空氣。不料正在這時候，中共突然提出了一個備忘錄，要求政府立即停止對張家口之一切軍事行動，否則即宣告全面破裂。幸而政府很快的發表一個嚴正的聲明，對於解決時局提出兩項具體意見及最後容讓的限度。只要中共參加談判，獲有協議，即可全面停戰，豈但張家口一隅而已。但是中共至今尚無正式的答覆。</p>
<p>中共雖未正式答覆，而延安廣播電台，前天却又非正式的聲明中共態度，竟又進一步的要求國軍退出本年一月十三日以後所收復的地區，否則中共即不參加改組政府的談判而將作戰到底。即此可見中共對於和平商談，根本缺乏誠意，其目的不僅在於張家口戰事的停止，直欲以不參加政府改組的談判，作爲要挾政府的手段。中共這種答覆，實在是「文不對題」，「答非所問」，而其心目中究欲何爲，實已昭然若揭。說穿了一句話，中共顯然想要用這種硬逼方法，使談判破裂，和平絕望，中國陷於分裂之境而後已。</p>
<p>回憶十個月來的和平商談，談談打打，打打談談，好像黃霉時期的天氣，晴晴雨雨，雨雨晴晴；也好像患了寒熱病，冷了一陣，又熱了一陣，熱了一陣，又冷了一陣。我們站在客觀的立塲，研究時局的癥結，早可看出和平市價的高低完全操縱於中共之手。它可以翻雲覆雨，爲所欲爲，它要談就談，要打就打；它有利的時候打，沒利的時候談；它有利的地方打，沒利的地方談。而它所惟一可恃的工具，就是利用政府與人民都因爲企求和平，不惜委曲求全之一念。惟其政府始終採取綏靖政策，遂使中共的氣燄，飛揚跋扈到如此。中共迷信武力爲萬能，最近國軍的反擊，雖已粉碎了它的迷夢，但它至今猶未覺醒。中共以爲我戰而勝，可以奪取整個的中央政權，戰而敗，可以分裂中國，割據稱雄，它早已承襲了中國數千年來「成則爲王，敗則爲寇」的古老衣鉢，以爲進退都可裕如。但於此，我們不能不提醒中共一句話：石敬塘的故事，是要受千秋萬世的唾棄的。</p>

<h3>南通見聞　街頭半是流亡客··共區苛暴不忍聽</h3>
<p>〔南通訊〕此次在南通小住了一個禮拜，所得的印象太壞了。在我的回憶裏，南通是一個繁榮，熱鬧，現代化的城市。一到上海後，就想回南通去看一次。勝利後，它是蘇北最先收復的，一切該復蘇了，孰意實業家張賽先生時期的整齊，雄壯，如今變成零亂，頹廢。模範縣的盛譽，已成過去了。要是張狀元有靈，得悉這一切，該是如何傷心。街頭巷尾每個人的表情，都是憂鬰的，要是偶爾問他爲什麼，他的回答是一言難盡。</p>
<p>使人警疑的周圍人講話，不盡是南通腔，而多是其他各縣份的語調。勝利後，共區苛政的結果，使這裏人口陡增，外來人數，殆與本地人參半，所以碰到的多半是我縣人。他們並非慕名而來，更非遊覽而來，他們是被迫流亡而來的。南通生活程度不見得低，油　柴米不見得便宜，但他們覺得這是一塊安樂土，可以自由地呼吸空氣，不受拘束地隨便講話，要比連一口薄粥都喝不到，一間茅棚都沒得住，思想受控制，行動受監視的地方，強得多了。他們的要求只希望能活得下去，然而連這最起碼的要求，在其區裏都達不到。蒼蒼蒸民，有何罪過。</p>
<p>分田—一畝三</p>
<p>據距通數十里來人談，共區分田的結果，每人只分得一畝三分地，連座園在一起，有人家座園大的，剛剛只分到一塊座園，試問座園如何種植，如何生產，如何生活，像這樣的人，只有等着餓死。實際上如以鄉爲單位，每人應分得兩畝多，然而只分給每人一畝三分地，多下的那兒去了，留着何用？這些問題，老百姓不能過問，要是過問，當局就會懷疑你，甚至會遭受到生命危險。共軍的解決民生，是解決少數人（可以說極少數人的）的民生，共軍的平均地權，是將地　平均到自己身上去了，其用意只希望少數人能够生存，加入工作的人能够生存，信奉共黨的人能够生存，最後連加入工作的人，都不能生存，也要被排擠，唯有信奉共黨的人才能生存。結果是赤化天下，一黨專政。</p>
<p>恐怖—隨便殺</p>
<p>在獨裁，恐怖的政策下，所謂解放區的人們，無可奈何地離開了家，紛紛逃亡出來。逃出的人不能讓當地當局知道，要是知道了，就被視爲「動搖份子」，罪名是很大的。所以出來的人，都是不聲不響地偷偷逃出的，逃到什麼地方，有時家中人都不知道。逃出的不外三種人；有資望的人，有資產的人，有知識的人。這三種人，是共軍的眼中釘，不惜用任何毒辣手段，將它拔掉。有資望的人，如果不受共軍利用，就被稱之爲老奸巨滑的「頑固派」。有資產的人，被認爲不思生產的「享福者」。有知識的人，如果不相信共軍主張，稱爲「阻碍工作者」。最滑稽的，一向不問世事，沉默寡言的人，也加上一個莫名的頭銜「懷疑份子」。總之，中立的人，不與之同流的人，不參加共軍陣綫的人，都被視爲化外之人，不容許存在。上面三種人，不得已時，要是稍有點表示，就以「莫須有」的罪名殺掉。某鄉有個老鄉長，新四軍剛到蘇北時，曾做過鄉長，在那個時候，被誇獎爲一個能幹的鄉長，幾十天以前，在一家店裏，談了點關於國軍的情形，被一個民兵隊長知道了，就以「反動派」的名義，帶到了一個荒野的地方槍決掉。秦始皇的坑儒，也沒有這樣殘忍。共黨報紙日夜所標榜的言論自由，人身保障，究竟作何解釋，是否有區域限制，而不適用於共黨所謂解放區域內。</p>
<p>希望—國軍到</p>
<p>逃到南通的人們，沒有一個不希望國軍早日開到。有時候，他們眼看到政府的施政，雖感到難盡人意，國軍的紀律，不免使人失望，但他們認爲此種現象是暫時的，偶然的。從比較裏，他們深深的感覺到政府的施政，較之共軍暴政要好得多了。他們對共軍的批評是：類似禽獸，不近人情。他們對共軍的認識是：巧言欺騙，高壓恐怖。他們不懂得民主論調，他們從實地的體騐裏，來辨別誰是誰非，那一個可以接近，那一個不可以接近。他們現在唯一的希望，大批國軍早日開到，澈底肅清共軍。只要有一天能回家，雖一口薄弱，一間茅棚，也就够了。（見之）</p>

<h3>英內閣創設國防部　統一海陸空三軍管轄權　亞歷山大出任部長閣員十三人調制</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕英政府今日發表公報，宣布創設一國防部，調整海陸空三部在英之工作，該公報題曰「防務之集中機構」，宣布英國防務機構之若干變動，惟並聲明此項改革乃以往四十年政策之自然發展，首相仍爲對防務之主要負責人，且將任國防委員會主席。國防大臣，樞密院大臣，外交大臣，財政大臣，海陸空軍三大臣，勞工大臣，供應大臣均將爲該委員會之常然委員。創設國防部，志在將閣員由二十人减爲十八人，並减低海陸空軍三大臣之地位，惟彼等雖未厠身內閣，仍居閣員之職位。國防大臣之任務爲依照國防委員會所定之一般政策，就廣大之綱領，將可撥用之資源分配於海陸空三軍，此將包括成立關於軍事硏究與發展之一般政策。國防大臣且將對一般行政各問題負責，三軍部將就一般行政制定共同政策。三軍部大臣茲已辭職，已由政府照准，即陸軍大臣勞遜，空軍大臣史丹斯蓋特勳爵，民事航空部大臣溫斯特勳爵。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕亞歷山大今夜被任爲英國國防部大臣，按亞氏自一九四〇年起任海軍部大臣，今將管轄海陸空軍三部，但國防部尚未組織完成，故亞氏暫時將爲不管部大臣。</p>

<h3>羅致少莊人才</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕。此間各政治觀察家談稱，英內閣此次改組，動機有二：其一爲組成單獨之國防部，其二爲羅致少壯派入閣。關於國防部之設立，係英國參謀總畏蒙哥馬利元帥最近與美國參謀總長艾森豪威爾元帥會議之結果。最近迭次會議，並決定保持英美加聯合參謀部。關於羅致少壯派人材，麥克尼爾（前任外務决官新任國務大臣）之升遷，即其一例。外相貝文對之甚爲器重，殆以外相之繼承者目之。同時新任各部次官多人，均爲靑年人材。</p>
<p>英內閣此次實行改組，乃不久以前英帝國參謀長蒙哥馬利元帥赴美會商之結果。（圖示）蒙帥（右）訪美進謁杜魯門總統（左）握手言歡時姿態。此影攝於白宮。（美國新聞處　）</p>

<h3>英舉行聯合國週　鄭大使廣播演說</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦五日電〕中國駐英大使鄭天錫博士，今日在英國廣播電台爲聯合國週發表廣播演說，呼籲全世界各國爲和平而團結。鄭氏稱，中國人種爲全世界所週知之具有愛好和平之天性，中國古代哲人曾敎以仁慈與正義之原則，並培養爲和平之基礎。鄭氏續稱，「吾人之國際關係，即以此等原則爲基礎，使世界各國眞誠合作，以達成和平目標及人類之愉快生活。在第二次世界大戰中，中國抗戰在八年以上，且受苦最甚，犧牲最大，故吾人渴望維持和平，並竭盡吾人所能，使聯合國有所成就。聯合國之原則，誠與巾華民國創始人孫中博士之遺敎相符合，蔣主席繼孫總理之遺志，爲中國人民之領袖，爲求建立一眞正巨大之一共和國家，乃與聯合國同心協力反抗條略。目前戰事已告結束，保證世界和平之工作落於聯合國肩上，然其機構仍在萌芽時代。除非吾人向全世界人民闡明其目的及其巨大之責任，並使彼等合作，否則欲達成目標，實非易事。此即爲聯合國週所爲者爲何。余獲有機緣說明中國衷心支持此聯合國週，及吾人對所有參與國家之謝忱，至爲榮幸。」</p>
<h3>邱吉爾發表演說　促全國團結抵制共產主議　茍一息尚存不容遽卸仔肩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：邱吉爾於週六在保守黨全國大會中發表演說，將日漸縮小之英帝國與日漸膨脹之蘇聯，作一對比。並請局勢若是嚴重，使渠不能退出公務生活。渠又指摘工黨政府對於巴勒斯坦問題「游移不定，毫無計劃」。印度可能發生不幸及流血事件，且將不保，同時緬甸不久亦將遭遇同樣命運。邱氏又稱，英帝國之臣民總數已逐漸减少，不足以往之四分之一，面蘇聯專制統治下之人民則日益膨大。邱氏續稱，一余久思退隱，第大局如此嚴重，實不容余遽卸仔肩，苟一息尙存，決繼續奮鬥，爲國効勞」。</p>
<p>〔路透黑沼五日電〕邱吉爾今日在此向保守黨大會演說，略謂，吾人今日與大降數鄰邦相同，不欲對本黨憲則作根本之討論，政府與其反對黨—社會黨—保守黨自由黨—現團結一致，抵制共產主義與共產黨。社會黨所宣布對共產主義之反對，雖今在本國不見重要，但在國外已發生頗有關係之勢力。至各黨對外交政策之主要方針，已獲大量之同意。英美兩國之密切合作，尤爲眞確，美國在歐所施堅毅不變之政策與其放棄孤立主義，實爲保障和平之主要堡壘云。</p>
<h3>美助猶太人復國　杜魯門對巴勒斯坦問題發表新聲明　直率拒絕猶阿區歸英治轄</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統頃致函英國首相艾德禮，稱：巴勒斯坦問題必須立即予以解決，母需等待巴勒斯坦圓桌會議至十二月十六日繼續開會時，再行討論。美國政府願予以一切必要之援助，俾遣送流亡之猶太人，前往巴勒斯坦。此事在今年冬間必須覓得解決辦法。余本人向來主張將猶太人十萬名，移殖巴勒斯坦，即使在巴勒斯坦問題獲得完全解決之前，此事亦應立刻開始實行。余願向國會提出經濟上援助巴勒斯坦一項計劃。此外，余對於猶太復國運動，擬在巴勒斯坦設立猶太國一項計劃，亦表贊同云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統之聲明，已使英美兩國對於巴勒斯坦問題之立塲，截然不同。其與英國意見相左者，有下列數點：第一、英國堅持在未得阿拉伯人某種同意之前，不願令猶太人大量移居巴勒斯坦，以免激生事變，杜魯門則完全與以否認。第二、英國堅持巴勒斯坦劃分爲猶太區與阿拉伯區同處於英國治權之下，杜魯門則直率與以拒絕，謂美國各大政　均反對此計劃。第三、杜魯門竭力贊成猶太公會所提巴勒斯坦分治方案，曾向英首相艾德禮建議採納，英國於此顯未有何進行。猶太公會所提方案之實質，即許猶太人在巴勒斯坦相當區域內成立一個獨立國家，英國應立即給發護照，使十萬猶太人移居巴勒斯坦。據杜魯門總統宣稱，不信劃分猶太區與阿拉伯區之計劃，與猶太公會所提方案，竟判若鴻溝，　　　和。美政府於其解決方法，願畫一臂之助。</p>
<h3>英表示遺憾　各方反響</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕杜魯門總統今日所公布對英之籲請，即在巴勒斯坦整個問題解決以前，宜許巨數猶太移民入巴勒斯坦，今夜據英外交部發　人聲稱：英國當局對此表示　　。總統之籲請或將損害目前正在進行中之錯綜談判，總統決議於今日宣布此文，實逆英首相艾德禮所表示之願望。昨夜駐英美代使迦爾曼曾謁見首相。出總統之文吿示之，首相即請俟其與外相貝文討論之後再行公布，而外相今在巴黎，未暇及此，不意總統竟未應此請，連行公布。即倫敦猶太人各界對於此文，亦不甚歡迎。某有經騐之猶太觀察家謂此文之發表，志在吸引十一月間國會選舉之票數，民主黨或可因以增多所獲之票數，但不能改變英國之政策云。</p>
<h3>阿亦表反對</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕據阿刺伯某政治家稱，杜魯門總統如欲實行其主張，使猶太人「立即大批」移入巴勒斯坦，勢將破壞和平。叙利亞衆議員柯里亦稱，英國已允在巴勒斯坦圓桌會議休會期間，不准有猶太人進入巴勒斯坦。全體阿刺伯人對於杜魯門之聲明將全力反對。杜魯門欲使阿剌伯人接受其提議，惟有派遣美軍五十萬人，强制執行。惟余以爲杜氏並未老慮及此。艾德禮首相本人則尙未發表意見，杜魯門之電報到達倫敦時，此間猶太領袖正在敎堂舉行禮拜。殖民部與外交部官員稱，杜魯門之聲明性質重要，應提付內閣討論，目下未便輕易置評。</p>
<h3>英備忘錄提交土國　說明對海峽問題意見　美正考慮否探取新行動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕英外交部發言人今晨聲稱：駐土耳其英國大使凱萊爵士昨以備忘錄一件送交土政府，說明英國對蘇聯所致安加拉牃文提議修改目前黑海海峽地位之意見。該員雖未透露備忘錄之內容，但否認英國促請土政府毅然拒絕蘇聯最近建議之說。此間消息靈通方面咸信，備忘錄中含有下列數要點：（一）蘇聯建議今後應由瀕鄰黑海諸國管制韃靼尼爾海峽，並由蘇聯與土耳其協同防衛，英國對此，不予贊同。（二）英國雖贊同修正一九三六年規定韃靼尼爾海峽地位之蒙德婁公約，但覺此事應由國際大會吿成之。（三）英國願於此一會議召開以前，由任何有關雙方作直接討論，惟覺實際談判應由大會爲</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕代理國務卿文克遜今日宣稱：關於蘇聯要求與土耳其共管韃靼尼爾海峽一事，美國是否將探取新行動，尙在積極考慮中。國務院將以各項決策請示杜魯門總統，聽由總統決定是否向蘇土兩國提出照會。</p>

<h3>霓虹燈明日起如再使用　受停電處分　電力增產分三步驟實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於暫停使用霓虹燈及裝飾燈，目前公用局係採取和平　導手段，深盼全市商民，共體時艱，一律遵辦。唯據公用局長趙會珏吿記者稱，倘於本月七日以後，仍抗命使用者，將採取停電處分。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據公用局長趙曾珏稱，爲求解決上海電力荒，以期增加生產，完成國策，公用局已將增加電力一項，規定爲明年度中心工作之一。依據三大步驟，積極完成：（一）督促各發電廠修復戰時損毀機器，（二）督促各發電廠添置新機器。（三）由公用局輔導協助各發電廠，辦理貸款，採購發電機等項事宜。最近公用局曾協助閘北水電公司，向四聯總處借款二十四億元。供修理兩套毀損之斯夸德機器之用。唯此兩套機器需年餘始可修畢。外傳閘北水電本年度可發電三萬瓩，並不確實。法商水電新購柴油機器一具，三千六百瓩，年底可到。另有一具，明年六月可到。</p>
<p>目前上海每月發電量爲十四萬一千瓩。倘一切工作，皆能依照預定計劃實施，則明年年底可增加發電量三分之一。計三月底可達十八萬瓩，六月底十八萬八千六百四十瓩，九月底十九萬二千六百四十瓩，十二月底二十一萬七干六百四十瓩。</p>
<p>另一方面，公用局會同有關專家組織之「上海電力網技術委咒會」，計劃於明年上半年度完成整個上海電力網，促成三萬三千瓩環形電力之實現。同時使全市各電廠之發電，輸電，配電及用電全部合理化，標準化，統一</p>
<h3>化粧品業代表晉京請願</h3>
<p>本市化粧品工業同業公曾，爲請求當局緩征最近頒佈施行之化粧品貨物稅按價抽百分之四十五，以挽救整個同業危機起見，特推派代表理胡伯翔，理事林汝康，馬凌雲，周鳳礙，符可銘等晉京　立法院財　部等有關機關呼籲請願，據該代表等稱：（一）現在化粧品工業範圍狹小節陋，大都爲手工製造，有簡單機械設備者廖廖可數，實不足爲征收貨物稅之對象。（二）進口化粧品大量湧進，大部爲漏稅之貨物，因此成本極低，國製化粧品木已難與爭衡，今若再加貨物稅百分之四十五，將更無立足之地。（三）化粧品名稱實太含混，如爽身粉，香皂，花露水，潤膚膏，面蜜等品，均爲夏令或冬令之日用衛生品，不能視作化粧品看待云云。</p>
<h3>波蘭僑民一批返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕波蘭籍僑民一批，業乘蘇輪斯摩爾尼號起程至海參歲，然後轉西伯利亞大鐵道返國。內有醫生二人，海員五人，戰時流落上海，爲日軍拘於集中營內。在此迢迢長途之中，聯總除爲彼等代付一切旅費外，並供給寒衣，被褥，及配給食品。岡中極右者爲聯總駐滬辦事處流亡人民遣送組主任柯柏及其助手柯　夫。（紐約時報攝）</p>
<h3>明瑩·炫耀·堅硬　金剛鑽身價千倍　最好的有「五十八翻」　每克拉二百六七十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕我本身不過是一塊礦石。在已發現的化學原素中講，我是碳元素的一種。到目前爲止，我的同類被發掘出來的，還是相當的少。物以稀爲貴，於是，我被目爲「寳」石。再說，我的品質最堅硬，於是華夏的同胞們，都給我題上一個「金鋼鑽」的尊稱。</p>
<p>我給人外貌上的感覺，是明瑩，純潔，坦白，炫耀。可是，不幸得很，我幾個有名的同僚，自經人類發掘琢磨後，就有它們的悲劇和歷史。奧國的哈布斯堡王朝，俄皇　洛夫，法國王室畢德，波斯蒙果國皇伊漠……那個顯赫一時的王朝，不跟我發生一段密切的姻緣！我同僚中最著名的一顆，現在正鑲在英皇的冠冕！</p>
<p>我大部份的同僚，都來自南菲的慶伯利，和南美的巴西兩地。短短的幾百年間，我竟成爲國際間流通的唯一寳物！</p>
<p>上海——國際間的大都市，憑什麼可以少得了我。不過，我和上海人的接觸，才只有四五十年的歷史。我在市面上受人愛戴，更不過是近十二三年的事。</p>
<p>現在我這批在市面上流通的同僚，是很難分門別類的。不過，就色澤上說，可勉强分爲白，黃，紅，藍，烏五種。比較起來，當然以白色而帶淡紅的一批，最稱珍貴。上海人替它起了個「火油鎭」的尊號。可惜這批「火油鑽」，究屬鳳毛麟角。而習見流通的一批，都是色澤白而不帶淡紅的就是普通所稱的「白鑽」！</p>
<p>吿訴你，一顆琢得很好的標準鑽石，有「五十八翻」，也就是五十八個小面。請你細細端詳一顆鑽石的腰部，你就可看出它分開爲頭部和尾部。頭部上最漂亮的一塊小平面，叫做「桌面」。圍着它的那些小面八個叫做「星」，四個叫做『斜面」，四個叫做「稜形面」，八個叫做「十字面」，八個呌做「巧面」。這卅三個小面，在一顆躦石的平面，分佈在各不同的稜角，發射光芒。再說尾部的小面，大多是少過頭部，只有二十五小面。它們的名稱是：「古力」（和頭部的「桌面」相對的），四個「率子」，四個「楔面」，八個「十字面」，和八個「巧面」。據說現在因爲琢工機器日益進步，最好的已可琢到六十四翻了。</p>
<p>八一三砲火響了，正是我在上海生命史上的一大轉捩點。因爲，從那時起，但見不盡鈔券滾滾來，我的「身價」也與日供增。拿火油鑽講，民國廿五六年時，每克拉是一千四五百元，目前已是二百六七十萬元了！再拿次一些的白鑽講，現在市價也徘徊在一百六十萬至二百萬元之間。</p>
<p>不過，鑽石的行市，還得參酌它的份量而分檔。例如，拿白鑽講，五十分（牛克拉）以內，每克拉以七八十萬元比例計算。廿分左右的，每克拉以三四十萬元此例計算。但十分以內的小鑽，行市又要大到七八十萬元一克拉比例計算了。這都是拿它琢磨的難易，和流通的廣狹，此例訂算出來的。</p>
<p>平心而論，九年來我「身價」只步漲了二千多倍，比起其他的物價來，漲得還算公允。可是說句凄涼話，市面上流通買賣的，只是些六七十分到一克拉半的鑽石。要搜買一顆上十克拉的鑽石，就是你踏遍全市五六十家珠寶商店，結果還是一場空。據說以邵逆式軍搜藏的宏富，最大的鑽石，也只有十幾克拉。不過，也有一個珠實商說：上海最大的鑽石，每顆大致在四十克拉左右，顆數當然少之又少，至於在那個搜藏家的掌握中呢，始終是個牢不可破的謎！</p>
<p>不過，我得向專拿我當作飾物的人們提出最嚴重的抗議，憑什麼單把我當作點綴的傀儡。我該鄭重的聲明，我有其至高無上的工業效用在。試看精密的機械中，飛機的昇降機，名錶的轉軸，那一個重要的工業部門，少得了我。爲了這，我要世界上鑽石的搜藏家，給予我新的評價，使我擺脫專事裝飾的桎梏，而多替人類創造些工業上的偉蹟！</p>
<h3>銀錢界實行節約　省卻非必要宴會酬應　通函同業廣徵意見中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金融界領袖李馥蓀。秦潤卿等，最近發起銀錢界節約運動，同時中央銀行總裁貝淞蓀，對之極表贊同，今先由李銘函叙緣由，開列發起人姓各，通函同業，廣徵意見，以備擬訂規約，再行聯銜徵求同業人士參加。茲由記者素得李君原函，刋錄如下：「「謹啓者：吾國八年抗戰，人力物力，消耗絕鉅，今後非全國人民克勤克儉，積蓄資力，用之於建設之途，則勝利成果，恐有隳棄之虞，故蔣主席所以勗勵民衆者，於實行節約改善風氣一點，言之再三；而本市節約運動，亦正在吳市長暨各界領袖倡導之中。日前與同業中人士談論及此，僉以</p>
<p>上海風氣之奢靡虛浮，今甚於昔，金融界人士爲市民中優秀份子，對於節約運動允宜躬行力踐，期挽頹風。當時有人提及滬上人士近來宴會酬應之頻繁，在座諸君，會認此種宴會酬應大半均非必要，金融界人士方面今後首宜省除，囑銘爲之提倡。上述提議、深合鄙懷，歸納理由，約分三點：（一）非必要之宴會，金錢時間不免浪費，在戰後之今日，吾人多</p>
<p>一分浪費即國家少一分建設力量。（二）勤儉爲吾國固有美德，在富於保守性之金融界人士，最能體會，一實行節約，深符當仁不讓之義。（三）金融界人士日常事務，本屬繁一忙，公務餘閒，均願有較多之休息機會，較多之家庭生活時間，使疲勞易於恢復。凡非必要之酬酢，直接足以減少個人之修養，間接足經影響治事之效率。謹案抗戰時，銘</p>

<p>英國人士皆以勤儉自勉，以全力從事復興工作，某財政專家邀至家中晚餐，見其家並無傭僕，肴饌簡單，其烹製持遞，均由主婦親任。由此觀之，在貧乏之我國，儉之一字，較盟邦殊多媿色。依吾人觀察，金融界人士中，對於非必要之宴會抱有反感者，，恐居多旣不便一概謝絕，受邀後或不能不設宴答謝，故表面上</p>
<p>未能免俗　實際上則人同此心。爲今之計，吾人似不妨各本坦直，避免數衍，共同聲明對非必要之宴會，一概屏除，此外喜慶饋贈等等，亦一概力從省儉，謹先專函徵求高見，並將發起諸君姓名開列於後，敬乞惠予指教，以便訂立規約，觀迎同業人士參加，至深欣盼。」發起人：貝淞孫·秦潤卿·林鳳苞·徐廣遲·李道南·沈日新·潘仲麟·項叔翔·孫瑞璜·徐國懋·陳朶如·居逸鴻·曹吉如·李　哉·李銘·</p>

<p>（二）腿部潰瘍</p>
<p>蔣輝問　家母患下腿潰瘍十餘年，屢醫無效。有時不醫亦能自愈，惟不久又復潰爛，近來患處益形擴大，幾及小腿全部，日夜劇痛，肌肉消瘦，因在諸暨鄉間，又爲經濟力量所限，無法住院療治，生命危殆，未知有無自療藥品可購，至祈賜答爲感。</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕　慢性潰瘍，須先作血液檢驗，然後再依法治療。</p>
<p>（三）智舌炎腫脹</p>
<p>金克宏問　鄙人幼時，舌面忽破碎有深紋。並叢生紅點，舌尖生刺，溢鮮血。並有腐爛狀，不痛不癢，迄今十多年，時發時愈，並無一定。現舌頭腫脹長大，異於常人。味覺雖無妨，但言語讀書，十分不便，口齒不清，咬字不凖。曾請中西醫士診治，皆不見效，請示醫治方法？擬請貴欄賜答，不勝感禮禱之至。</p>
<p>〔張仲明醫師答〕　貴恙恐係慢性舌炎，起因於維他命B2缺乏。宜注射Riboflavin製劑。</p>

<h3>棉紗客掮怠工　原因爲要求加佣　紗市一度停頓小二三萬　紡建配布八種申請不踴躍</h3>
<p>紗市日前隨金鈔升　後，昨市客銷　寂，交易稀少，重復下跌十萬元光景，同時紗業居間人之　中社，（即掮客公會）爲要求增加佣金，與紗業公會發生爭執，各掮客彼此相約，勸導暫停　攬，以致紗號家與客帮及實用廠家之買賣，因無媒介，皆乏成交，直至近午，始略有做開，價約較上日降落二三萬元，四十二支做三百三十五萬元，二十支做二百十七萬元，供係業巾對手成交，走勢疲軟。</p>
<p>又訊：棉紗布布場昨晨一度停業，至上午十一時三刻始行恢復交易。其原因除市塲　客增加佣金外，尙有紗號業公會　舉新光內衣廠等，非法將紡建公司配售之紗拋售黑市，一　手閒，　利每包達八十一萬元事，紡建無明白表示？致釀成停市，事後紡建負責人稱：配售棉紗，以加工廠商爲主，但少數廠商將配貨　　之事，非紡建所願，故對檢舉　商，即予停配，但除停配之外，尙無對付方法。日前接獲紗號業公會通知，檢舉一部份廠商將配紗　售，即已按造被檢　名單通知各該廠行取消配貨權利，並已答覆紗號業公會。嗣後如有發現，決予停配云。</p>
<p>昨布市亦無甚榮辱，交易益呈閒散，客銷停滯，本復交易大都　　用者，零星探講，是以欲無力，紡　昨循列開售布疋計八種，龍頭細布八萬六千元，總额　全部酢量配給，同業一號起至一百五十五號，復自七百八十七號至末號有配，計總疑二萬四千疋，其他各貨，大部份皆有配給，但本期申請講買者，不甚踴躍，其故因　根仍未　動，　息甚高，殊不合算耳。</p>
<h3>中央銀行具總裁　昨再指示錢兌業　切實奉行三辦法律　美鈔價不得過電匯五%</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美鈔交易，自錢兌業公會於日前通吿全體會員暫停三天後，即吿絕跡。昨日各錢兌號對美鈔交易，仍多未做開。惟四川路南京路一帶，沿途仍不乏外籍商人，進行小額美鈔之買賣。黑黑市做開價格，的在四千二百元左右，買賣價相差一百元據非。正式消息，仍　求多於供。惟一般情况，自常局訂定各種買賣臨時辦法三項後，業已轉趨穩定。</p>
<p>記者旋訪錢兌業同業公會理事長汪雲程，據談：昨日上午十時，又奉中央銀行貝總裁之召，再度晋見，吳市長代表市府林參事亦在塲。當表示：希望錢兌同業善體當局意旨，切實奉行日前訂定買賣美鈔之臨時辦法三項。凡買賣美鈔，祇能依照央行法定對美匯率，另加百分之五爲標準，否則必予嚴辦，如發現有鉅額買戶並抬價購美票渚應立向市政府報吿，不得隱瞞，會議至中午始散，汪氏當於昨日下午六時許，召業該業理事，共同會商，並決議通吿各同業切實奉行。又據談：週一恢復美鈔買賣時，按照臨時辦法規定，美鈔市價，應爲三千五百十七元五角，故佔計買賣價格，當在三千五百元，至三千五百二十元之園，惟恐乏實際交易。市况可能有一二週之淸淡。現錢兌業所感困難者，即美鈔新舊券間題，正謀求得合理解決云。</p>
<h3>美鈔交易停頓了　金價恍惚不定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨恍惚不定，晨開三〇萬，開後曾見高至二二一萬，經央行壓制下，逐漸下游，十時後央行以一二八萬五之價，配給三〇條，入後銀根報緊，適逢週六，斬多紛紜，曾盤低至二一六萬，始告維持，傳稅紛紜，人心被激，有餘剩頭寸者，頗多吸納，曾同漲到二二一萬五以上，午刻在二一九萬五光景盤旋，午後逢週現貨交易極爲平靜，結果與前收相同，飾金紋銀未更，銀元更昂至二千元關邊，暗拆初緊後平，息價自一角半至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣並無公開性之交易，暗市極難做開，美鈔初時四一〇〇元左右，近午時回升至四三〇〇元，午後逢週六更少動靜，結果與前收相彷彿，港票亦乏公開性之交易，市價因中電報縮，買價八四〇元，賣價須八七〇元，較前日漲起二十元，港滙賣戶甚少，喊價八七〇元左右，印滙一〇四〇元至一〇六〇元，英滙一三八〇〇元至一四〇〇〇元，均昂於前收，美匯並無交易做開。</p>
<h3>港幣暴漲　值法幣九百零</h3>

<h3>念頭又轉到公價格　統丙跳高六百七</h3>
<p>公債人心續俏，綢業銀行到期押款貨有售，但零星之金融界頗有購買，投機家遂力抬，統丙自二二二〇元哄高至二四五〇元，多方獲利了結，中途曾回跌至二〇七〇元，股戶再納，散多哄抬，復扳高二六〇〇元高價結束，結果較前收漲起六七〇元，甲乙丁亦升二七〇元，統戊漲三五〇元。</p>
<h3>又有三種公價　九日還本抽籤</h3>

<h3>解釋兩個問題　「××氏」與「妾」</h3>
<p>此次民政處辦理戶政人員集中訓練，講解戶口複查「姓名」，與「稱謂」兩欄塡寫方法時，關於「××氏」與「妾」問題，報上曾有文論述，茲特將「××氏」與「妾」兩個問題申述於下：</p>
<p>（一）姓名爲人之符號，故國民政府公布之姓名使用限制條例，規定中華民國人民之本名，以一個爲限，登記於戶籍上之姓名，爲本名。此次戶口複查，即代替人民聲請戶籍登記，塡寫姓名，即市民在法律上之權義得有保障。爲適應專實，講習時曾補充說明，年齡過高之女子，不可能以名字見吿時，准塡「××氏」。</p>
<p>（二）「妾」於民國廿年五月五日以後娶者，於法律上已無地位，戶籍簿上自不便爲其登載，須依照內政部卅二年十一月二十日渝戶字第一一一〇號公函，暨卅五年寅陽渝戶二電規定，塡爲「同居人」或其他家屬，（並非僅塡「家屬」兩字，須注意。）</p>
<p>（三）戶籍登記係根據人民聲請，人民聲請有二個以上之妻同列，戶籍機關不能拒絕登記，因戶籍機關係超然之登記機關，非人民之利害關係人也。</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>談演員態度</h3>
<p>— 高衡</p>
<p>演員—表演藝術家，在舞台上直接和觀衆們發生着關係，他傳達着劇作者和導演在演出上的意識和情感，他執行着藝術在敎育上的任務，他要使觀衆對於藝術能够理解和認識，因此，在每次演出的時候，導演，劇作者，舞台工作者甚至於許多熱心於藝術的觀衆，都寄予極大的熱望在演員的身上，因爲一個戲的成收，演員是占有着很大的要素的。</p>
<p>因此，許多演員在技巧的磨練，藝術的修養上，生活的態度上不能不如臨深淵如履薄冰般地謹愼，虛心，努力和進取；爲了保障自己的成就，爲了整個戲劇界的前途。</p>
<p>然而，有着不少的演員，醉心於自己的演技，固執着一己的藝術觀念，歪曲了演出的目的，在排演上馬虎潦草，演出時隨機應變；私生活的糜爛，不是你所想得到的，什麼舞台上的合作，藝術上的良心更是與我無關！</p>
<p>自然，這不能一筆抹煞！上海在這幾年裏也有着造詣頗深的演員。但是太少了。</p>
<p>一個演員必需做到：在藝術上求嚴肅，在排演上求認眞，演出時決不馬虎，演出後也不會自誇，學習精神上認眞，生活態度上不亂，不隨便打秋風，不任意打遊擊，要能做到不是一個「戲子」而是一個「戲劇藝術家」。</p>
<p>在目前上海演劇風氣最嚴肅的要算『觀衆演出公司』了，他們的排演，他們的私生活，他們的藝術作風，他們的藝術態度，都是嚴正的，沒有一個苟且，這種良好的祚風，在幾位領導人物上果然起着作用，然而，最主要的還是每個演員的自身。</p>
<h3>道具與精彩</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>這問題是常被忽略的。這是一種根本的問題；道具管理者每自認是事務，而不是藝術家。因此，常不加創作，敷衍了事。致別人亦不重視　　　，進而輕視工作者。</p>
<p>新劇藝所　　　　具管理者的，跟其他部門　　，要有精湛的藝術修養，　　　　史基礎，豐富的社會常識，　任勞任怨的精神，認眞鑽研的態度。還要懂得力學，美學，多偉大地統一。絕不超出演出藝術的完整。同時還要有完成各部門要求的偉大藝術的義務和良心。</p>
<p>茲作如下的分類，以作管理者研究的途徑：</p>
<p>（一）由國別分：中國傢俱多朱紅色，紫檀色，赭色，黑色。目的在造成嚴肅，莊重，堅穩的感覺。故質料多從重，綫條多從直，色彩多從暗，構造多從煩。而西洋則多用銀色，白色，黃色，或赭色與赤色，目的在美麗，舒適與簡單，故質料多取輕，綫條多取圓，色彩多取明，構造多取簡。尤少用雕花。</p>
<p>（二）由朝代分：中國古封建時代，以武鎭天下，一切傢俱，均求其威重有力，故有虎皮交椅，虎腿案桌產生。尙禮以後，桌椅均求其方整，於是椅背直立不傾。及唐代美術發達，桌椅几榻，又極盡工細雕刻之能事，一改舊觀。至希臘建築藝術白熱期間，桌椅及踏脚板之構造，均極優美面合重力；尤以堅細細圓柱桌椅腿，史有建築的意味。十八世紀法國習於虛榮，於是奇怪的形式，華麗的雕刻，耀眼的色彩，舒適的靠墊，金壁輝煌，不一而足。及近代科學發達以後，流綫型舒適而美麗的傢俱，便又無止境的產生。這是時代的賜予，也表現着時代的特徵。</p>
<p>（三）由戲劇類型分：戲有悲劇，喜劇，笑劇，鬧劇，及浪漫的，古典的，寫實的，幻想的，和機械構成的等等之不同類型與演出。其一切導演，佈景，燈光，表演，服裝，道具，化裝等設計，均將因此而不同。我們知這；悲劇在引起人恐怖與悲憫的氣氛，巴彩宜暗，級條宜直，形體宜重。喜劇要造成明朗愉快的氣氛，色彩宜明，綫條宜柔，形體宜輕。而笑劇與鬧劇則在造成幽默與躪動的氣氛，故色彩宜鮮，綫條宜斜，形體宜錯亂與笨拙。其他加浪漫的要敢於放縱，古典的要稔於歷史，寫實的思想精細，幻想的要富於創造與組織，機械構成的要懂得力學與機械。</p>
<p>（四）由體積分：大體積的我們稱之爲傢俱或大道具，小體積的我們稱之爲裝飾小道具和隨身小道具。大道具不再贅述。裝飾小道具是裝飾景內的小玩意。如鏡框，花瓶，書籍等，十八世紀筵席上的酒杯與餐具和中國的酒杯與餐具，有着絕對的區別。同樣中國唐朝與淸朝，淸朝與民國，民國與抗戰後的色彩與形式，亦有着極大的不同。至隨身小這具，它充份的多有性格身份的表現力。管理者決不能因其小而忽視</p>
<p>總之，道具之色彩雖未勝過形式，然亦不弱於形式。一般之應用介乎佈景與服裝之間，太與服裝佈景相反，則有失調和，太鄰近，則又易被「吃」去。但假若管理者能利用光彩，勇於創造，一切法則均將退隱智慧之後。</p>
<p>近代西歐演出幻想劇時，曾利用機械使桌椅轉動與變幻，吾亦想我國管理者，無論利用色彩，綫條，或明暗，亦能給道具以轉動與變幻；但這變幻是內在的，而不是形體的，是靈魂的，而不是機械的。</p>
<h3>評清宮外史</h3>
<p>— 孫㫰</p>
<p>我在桂林就讀過「光緒親政記」，覺得它硬是緊湀凝鍊。這本戲是從宮廷生活寫國家政治，從晏起梳頭修花園選妃子慶壽寫國防和日寇，從家法洋務國粹太上感應篇寫滿淸的最後。而這一切祗不過爲着愛新覺羅一家，爲着那拉氏，爲着李蓮英。什麼國事，家法，實際全是李總管一個人的主意。而這的的確確是過去不久的中國歷史故事。這故事至今影響着我們中國人，並且這種故事在中國歷史上不知重複過多少次，我們對於這類故事該很熟悉。</p>
<p>那位慈禧太后，她自己當然以爲自己大才大德，勞苦功高，替自己加上了幾十個好字眼的頭銜，實則不過是一個能幹的財主婆而已。她做了許多壞事，她心裏有數，她祗不許別人說，誰說，她就殺人。可是她殺寇連材的時候，她自己也哭，看來她還有點人性。至於李蓮英之流是連這一點人性都沒有的。在寇連材臨死之前，他還不忘記說些刻毒話。他那麼兇毒，他倒要求別人有良心，那眞是天曉得！而翁師傳也祗想摘李鴻章的花翎脫李鴻章的黃罵褂，問他要錢辦海軍就沒有，賠起款來他倒可以想辦法。可見當時的公　大夫也不過如此，然而翁師傳到底是不贊成喪權辱國的，榮　之流和他一比，那可又差得遠了。作者往往用對照的塲面把這些人物深刻地表見出來，結構謹嚴，剪裁精審，在把　住觀衆這一觀上的確非常成功。</p>
<p>葉子的戲我在桂林和遵義看過多次，這次她果然把慈禧太后的潑辣，機靈，精細，狡獪，獨斷，狠毒，都做出來了。她幾次的笑，幾次的假開心，假慈悲，幾次對於李蓮英的關切，都表演得妥貼分明，看起來眞舒服。陽華先生演李蓮英，歪頭扭頸的姿態，怪聲怪氣的說話，裝出一位諂媚驕傲欺上壓下自私自利陰險刻毒，贏得滿塲忿恨。此外寇連材的年輕——這包括天眞，正義，勇敢的角色，是劇中惟一可愛的人物。李鴻章先受屈於翁師傅，繼被制於李蓮英，他那種有苦說不出的樣子，眞是難得。全劇的脚色搭配得非常凑泊，祗有那戲子，縱使有李蓮英兄妹的撑支，他所做的到底不是件好事，他竟那麼强項，在太后皇帝之前一點也不畏懼，是不是過火些！</p>
<h3>有聲電影二十年</h3>
<p>— 江</p>
<p>今年逢華納發行有聲電影二十週紀念，該公司創辦人賈克華納“Jack　L．Warner”述其二十年來爲電影事業努力之經過，譯出來供人參考，不是沒有意義的罷。</p>
<p>二十年前，有聲電影試騐成功；我們累年來的工作亦得了一些收穫，但有聲電影發展到今日之情形，豈是任何人所能意料的呢！</p>
<p>我們辦電影事業，起始僅是一家規模極小由百貨商店改組成的影院，那時父親爲了籌集開辦的資本，曾經把他最心愛的一隻金錶常去，在設備方面則速座椅還是備來的。</p>
<p>至一九一二年，才由辦影院而自製影片，我們一向抱着奮鬥冒險的精神，雖然屢遇挫折；但是亦奠定了我們事業的基礎。</p>
<p>爲了使我們的理想能够實現。換句話說就是爲了希望試騐有聲覺影成功，將我們所有的財力或精力孤注一擲亦在所不惜，當然最後我們是勝利的；可是這種勝利是經過了一段漫長的黑夜後而看見的，家兄山姆華納“SamL．Warner”即在其間爲事業而捐軀了。</p>
<p>在各界慶祝我們發行有聲電影成功，我們又負起了一種新的任命，一種表揚民主，使電影與世界民主潮流配合的工作，美國電影的確替民主國家盡了不少的義務，至少他們是因此而對於自身的環境有了一種更深切的認識</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，美國電影可以說不負爲國家的宣傳器具，而在兵士訓練方面，藉電影又縮短了不少訓練的時間。</p>
<p>有聲電影的成功我們是可以驕傲的，而我們更足以自誇的是二十年來在各方面的成就，我們能够利用機會，負責任，我們一向是往前跑的！</p>

<h3>美英法影片在市場競爭</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>美國的片商，如果要維持他們歐洲市場過去的優勢，將遇到一個空前的困難時期。過去，好萊塢影片在歐洲的勁敵，當爲德國，現在德國是戰敗了，繼起的則爲英法。因爲英法兩國，今後都將奪取歐洲的影片市塲，預備根據觀衆心理，大量攝製迎合口味的影片。</p>
<p>英國戰後的電影事業，別具雄圖，除了擁有大量的資本外，更實行和好萊塢各影片公司合作，基礎早已打好，祗要能按照計劃，逐步進行。法國的影片，一待產量相當加多後，就可抓住法國的電影觀衆。美片在歐洲將有何種困難遭遇，即此就可見到一斑。</p>
<p>電影界巨頭都相信兩三年後，法國的影片，不但可大量生產，而且能提高本質。尤其在故事中攙入新的理想。法國的影片，無論在想像方面，在口味方面，都比好萊塢影片好，尤其是帶有地方性。</p>
<p>歐洲的電影觀衆，喜觀新的理想和新的技術，關於這些，法國時常有着一種特出的技巧。但現在，我們如果盼望這類影片，能在巴黎製作，則未免時間過早，祗有看好萊塢攝製了。然而最近好萊塢出品中『巴黎的一次謗毀」，已帶有歐洲的大陸性，祇是這種影片，不大多見而已。</p>
<p>尤其是在好萊塢，電影完全商業化，普通的片商，並不爲電影的效果而拍片，唯一目的，當在賺錢。爲什麼如此？就因過去六年，雖有戰爭，各影片公司獲利之厚，竟出人意想，技術方面因此亦不能十分顧到。今後此種作風，若不改變，必將失去海外市塲，特別是歐洲市傷，因爲有英法兩國與之競爭。</p>
<h3>陳大濩來滬省況</h3>
<p>余派鬚生陳大濩，前些時由平飛抵滬，皇后大戲院方面赴平人員亦同機返滬，聞陳此行係因其長兄最近由渝復員，特來探視，歸途過京或將稍留，圖爲大濩最近之打魚殺家劇照。</p>
<h3>今日的嘉寳　殷格蘭褒曼</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>一朶美麗的花葩，一位賢妻良母，一個寂寞時的伴侶；殷格蘭褒曼產生在今日這個滿處荆棘的時代中，的確是帶來了溫暖與安慰。好萊塢的影壇少不了她，她簡直是每一個人夢中的天使呢！</p>
<p>股格蘭褒曼平生最欽佩的是嘉寳，她們倆人同是瑞典人，二十年前的好萊塢是嘉賓的天下；現在嘉寳的地位由褒曼來代替了，幾十年來美國的銀壇竟爲瑞典人佔據；嘉寳與褒曼可以說是爲她們的祖國爭了不少的光榮了。</p>
<p>普通女子大凡都是愛虛榮，重名利的；此種情形在戲劇圈內尤爲顯著，但股格蘭褒曼却是例外，她不重名，不重利，更不愛一切人工的巧飾；她有天生的美麗，有溫淑的儀表，她待人謙遜，作事認眞；爲了眞的來褒獎這個藝人，亦爲了眞的要使觀衆認識這個藝人，且讓我們再來提出幾件關於褒曼的事吧。有一次，有一位記者問殷格蘭褒曼說；「褒曼小姐，你有沒有退出影壇的一天？」她的回答很滑稽：『爲了什麼我欲退出影壇？你想當我到了七十歲再來演戲時是多麼有趣呀！』她準是一個重事業的藝人，她今年才三十歲，由三十至七十還有四十年呢！股格蘭褒曼可以說是一個極紅的明星了，但是她決不因此而藐視他人；她常常一個人在紐約斯起雷茀脫飯店月餐，　用餐時又不喜歡侍者過分的慇懃，至於每餐所食則絕對簡化，她出外或赴宴時是從來沒有一次戴帽子的，這種習俗在美國社會婦女界中亦是很奇特的。股格蘭褒曼工作時認眞，工作後又很忠心於一切社會或團體之事；在戰爭期間地極力推銷公債，每次爲推銷公債而旅行各地時，她在啓程前總是這樣問她的丈夫：「要他人買公債必先問我們自己買了多少？」，股格蘭褒曼救國不肯後人，她今日的成功，非但是她在影壇上的成功，亦是她做人藝術上的成功。</p>
<p>殷格蘭褒曼最近的新作是與卡萊葛倫合演的“Notorious”，連該片她在好萊塢僅演了十二部影片，但是她已替自己立下不朽的名譽了！</p>
<h3>演員趙韞如</h3>
<p>— 曾慰</p>
<p>趙韞如，無疑地她是話劇界一個燦爛的明星。她這次赴美留學，是値得大家欣羨的。</p>
<p>趙女士在十八歲的時候，對於話劇，便發生了興趣。不過她的家庭，不允許她走上這一條路，把她送到漢口去讀書。沒有想到漢口也有外國電影，趟女士當然會去觀摩，她對於演劇始終是發生興趣的。一年，她知道南京的戲劇學校正在招考，她立志要去應試，不過怎樣去呢，這是一個困難的問題，可是終於給她找到了解決，她有一個叔叔在南京，她便去拜望他。</p>
<p>那一次考試，應試的有五百人，及格者只三十人。三十人中女子僅佔八人，而趙女士便是其中之一。這消息傳到了她蘇州的家庭，都替她可惜，說她是一個不孝的女兒。</p>
<p>不久抗戰軍興，趙女士由南京轉輾抵宜昌，終至重慶，而成爲一個話劇明星。</p>
<p>她在重慶演淸宮外史，連演四十餘日，賣座勿表。這戲每日上演六小時，而她需出塲五小時中，其煩重可知。</p>
<p>趙女士初次在重慶登台的時候，非常瞻怯。後來她努力使她的演出眞實化。一次，她塗着口紅，披着舊的大衣，吸着紙烟斜依在電桿木上。一個雉妓的老媽子對她說：「今天遝氣不好啊！」於是她知道她的扮演不錯了。她對於農婦村婦的扮演，竟能這樣實習的。</p>

<h3>美國文學的生長與其特性</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>有人說美國文學雖有三百年的歷史，但其興盛還不過是昨日的事。就美國的歷史說，確也是如此。不過美國的文學生長時期雖較之舊大陸爲短，然而正像美國的立國有其獨特的精神一樣，美國的文學，也自有其獨立的精神特性。</p>
<p>就美國的開國背景言，美國文學的初期帮精，自以清敎徒主義爲核心；嚴格說來，當時還說不上有所謂美國文學，有的祇是宗教性的文學和歷史紀錄之類以及少數的詩作吧了。如勃拉福特（William　Bradford　1590-1657）的「樸資茅斯殖民史」；溫叔魯白（JohnWinthrop1568-1649）的「新英格蘭史」；馬太（Cotton　Mother）的「新格蘭教會史」等；韻文方面如惠格爾華綏（Michael　WiggWiggorth　1631-1705）的「末日審判」的長詩，以及女詩人勃拉絲屈莉（Anne　Bradstreet1612-72）的「第十名詩神」等等。</p>
<p>這些東西都是美國獨立前的作品，當時美國的資本主義猶在萌芽時期，其文學表現祗能依託鈴反抗性的宗教精神。</p>
<p>但新大陸在資源上是一塊得天獨一厚的地方，同時受舊大陸宗教壓迫而來的美國移民，由於環境的啟發，不得不真有一種迫近現實而又富有冒險的精神。因此和宗敎性文學同時形成對蹠豐存在，而不旋踵間完會取代宗敎文學的，不是所謂「揭基精神」了。</p>
<p>如果說清教徒主義是舊大陸帶來的遺物，則楊基主義可說完全是隨美國資本主義經濟初期獨立發展俱來的產物。在清教徒主義時代，從舊大陸到美洲的移民，雖在經濟上反抗其母國，但在精神上多少還是受着舊大陸的影響。然而隨着美國經濟獨立發展，其精神上對舊大陸的離心傾向，也就日趨明顯。楊基主義就是這種精神離心傾向的產物。楊基主義的反抗性最初的流露也在政治方面，新的經濟代表階級產生了，像富蘭克林（BenjaluinFraukin），就是代表當時美國新興中產階級的典型人物，像他的「自傳」和「窮人李却特的生平」（Poor　Richard's　Al-manac），不僅政治思想和人生哲學大別於清教主義，即其文學的表現，亦擺脫宗教臭味的傳統，而獨關蹊徑。</p>
<p>當然，富蘭克林並不能種當時美國文學的代表人物；同時又因美國獨立運動迅速獲得成功，政治上的反抗運動，並沒有在美國文學史上獲得充分發展的機會；反之，因爲獨立運動的迅速達成，經濟上的開拓又突飛猛進，一種生活的普遍樂觀與希望，使新生的美國文學揭揚了奔放快樂的精神，在美國文學史上說來，這是美國的浪漫主義文學時代，這一時期的文學代表人物，可推舉埃文（Washington　Irving），柯柏（James　Fenimore　Cooper）及白利楊（William　CullenBryant）等人，</p>
<p>惟就嚴格意味言，像埃文等人的作品猶未能完全肅清清教主義的色彩，這自然是這輩人本身的教養關係。美國文學眞正獨立奔放時期，應說是由南北戰爭時期前後開始。在這一時期，美國始產生了灶自己的偉大文學者，其聲譽均是當之世界文學者無悚，像寫過「緋文字」的霍桑（Nathanice　Hawsthorne），文學兼哲學家的愛姆遜（Ralph　Walds　#merson），田園文學家凱尼且（John　Pendleton　Kennedy）掣人愛侖坡（Edgan　AllanPoe），幽默作家馬克吐溫……諸此大文學家，將歐洲歷數世紀的文學發展路徑，竟在短時期內在美國獨自的基礎上給融合發揮無遺了。</p>
<p>然而終由清教從主義與揚基主義而來的美國文學發展路徑，其所表現於美國精神的究竟是些甚麼呢？這可從兩個角度觀察，即在表現人格的場合，美國的文學精神是個人主義精神，在體騐社會）的塲合，則爲自由主義精神。這兩種乍見是矛盾的東西，實際上却是美國精神的完整一體，是分不開來的。早期美國文學的神秘主義傾向，以及現代美國文學的庸俗傾向（好聽些是大眾傾向），就是清教徒主義和揚基主或齣各自特色。不過到了現代，神秘主義巳爲庸席主義所漸次代替：個人主義的文學雖未見完全淘汰，但自由主義的精神發揚，似更爲現代美國文學精神的特色。像德萊塞（Theodore　Drelser）海清感一派的作家，就是大衆主義也是自由主義的作家。</p>
<p>美國的文學精神所以存有時蹠的特性，一是因爲美國的最初殖民者本爲來自舊大陸的人民，他們雖以宗敎的表面原因移殖到新大陸，然其精理的根底依舊是舊大陸的傳統；其初期文學自宗教色彩流向神秘主義，可說是舊的傳說利新的憬所憧交互影響的結果。所謂新的憧憬，即是美洲殖民地的開拓，不止招來了僅是英國的移民，比自世界各地招來了種族複雄的無歟人民。美國所以自稱爲合眾國，恰好說明了整個構成的複雜性格，由保守性的清敎徒主義而逐漸發展爲揚基主義，這才出現了眞是美國本色面月的獨有精神而到現在爲止，代表活潑奔放，現實而又近乎浪漫的揚基主義，仍不失爲今日美國文學的基幹特性，瞭解此點從，我們才可以再來觀察現代美國文學。</p>
<h3>路碑（外一章）</h3>
<p>— 彭翱漢</p>
<p>指示了生活旅人的路向，路碎孤獨地豎立在荒寂的三又路口</p>
<p>已經遭遇過許多次的風吹雨打，而路碑還是赤露着光滑的身軀，倔強地佇立着。……</p>
<p>打從荒遠的年代，當着人類開鑿了路綫起，路碑就被安置在這容易迷惑旅行者的路口邊。</p>
<p>懷着一顆方便他人的好心眼，路碑給旅人以驀地的慰藉。</p>
<p>「而生活呀！却是這般乾澀而坎坷哩！」</p>
<p>當路碑低聲控訴時，我輕輕地嘆息了。……</p>
<h3>浮烟遠岫圖</h3>
<p>— 清·王鑑</p>
<h3>墓塲</h3>
<p>憧憬着墓塲裏荒凉的神秘，我無言地踏進了亂堆着的荒塚中</p>
<p>那一堆一堆凸出的黃色土堆喲，曾經埋葬了多少無名英雄的美夢呀！</p>
<p>往日那些輝煌耀目的事蹟，到如今該己是歷史上的名詞了。</p>
<p>當綠色的鬼火跳躍在墓塲的邊沿時，我還能聽到那哀怨的幽靈底哭泣聲。……</p>
<p>「這悲慘的生命歸宿塲所呵！」</p>
<p>於是，我緩步地，以凄凉的心情，憑弔着死難者不散的英靈</p>
<h3>開美軍食盒感歌</h3>
<p>— 寶鑼</p>
<p>市間售食盒，云是美軍糧；配糧豈無限？戰士多死傷！</p>
<p>疊匣密密對，中實糖和果，馥郁檸檬酸，紅濃咖啡苦，我點一枝烟，悄悄懷今古！</p>
<p>餐罷有餘味，遺此知是誰？沙塲枯骨冷，親故啼正悲</p>
<p>天寒風雪厲，客魂孤且單！世亂未全定，勸群莫急轉輸迥。且待妖氛凈，春到賦歸來。竊笑爺娘雙垂淚，呱呱啼倦即酣限。萋萋芳草綠，游戲共蹁躚。從此昇平日，不憂烽火樂天年！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　54</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我本來也莫明其妙，再追了幾步，心下忽然一動，不禁岔口喊了出來「糟了」</p>
<p>「怎麼？」青年隊長放慢了脚步問。</p>
<p>「再轉過這個土包，就是我們的電站，我指着那三個傢伙的方向說。「大概我們的地方，給他們佔了，那裏或許有他們的大隊驻紥着哩！」</p>
<p>領隊聽了這話立即停了步，向同人打了一們手式。大家一見，都聚了攏來：只有一位，端整了手提機關，另外站在一邊，担任警戒。（這是受過訓練的規矩，一種自然動作步驟，無庸另下命令）。領隊請我說明山那邊電台的地形。我當即指明了方向和地形。領隊於是很老練的下了命令：五人一隊，以山前電台爲中心，左右包抄過去，叫我隨便參加一隊。我答應同領隊走公路這一邊。</p>
<p>他這種分撥，我很明瞭；大概他聽我說明地形之後，因爲不知敵人實力如何，不過可能是相常强火，預料他們逃回的幾個傢伙報告之後，也許要都山過來，抄我們的後路。若然的話，我們這樣一分撥，他們便要受我們兩面夾擊。萬一他們大隊仍舊走三人逃去的路，迎頭邀擊過來，我們也可以前後夾攻，祗要等我們的分隊抄到山前過來就成。</p>
<p>誰知我們步步探索，抄到山前時候，一眼看到我們的住宅（電台），却閱無一人，只有一陣陣火燒氣，夾着烟熏味，從山脚下捲了上來，我們的住宅，却仍舊是好好的。但一轉臉看到山脚下的電廠，却有兩個地方冒着濃烟。再看山頂一邊，也像沒有人跡。到了宅邊，探索過去，十分小心，恐中埋伏，誰知我們的分隊，已經送了暗號過來，表示不見敵踪，原來我們撲了一個空。這是把人實力估計過高之故。</p>
<p>這時我也顧了什麼，只告訴青年領隊，要去宅內搜索一下。傾隊把人派了崗位，就同我一齊探索進屋。第一要緊去察看的，當然是我那辦公室和發電機。我迫不及待，閃進室內，見一切東西都移了地位。搶到炕頭，打開櫥一看，什麼也沒有了，連幾件做掩蔽的衣服也拿走了。這固然早在預料之中。但心下也十分難過。因那架發電機，十分難得弄到，這東西不僅是非賣口，全日本現在也僅僅只有幾架。我正瞧着衣櫥發怔，室內突然一亮，原來天色將黑，室內已經不大能見東西，却是那位領隊，把電燈開了。</p>
<p>這一亮，衣櫥內有一樣東西，閃進了我的眼簾；乃是一個紅鉛筆畫的一個符號，另有「〇四」鰲在一旁，不覺大喜，這個符號，表示東西是給〇四號拿走了；同時，我也可以根據這個符號去找他。不過現在更加迫切，我認爲還是路局電廠裏，鼎元一家大人同小孩子們的安全問題。因爲我們站上，〇四號是個領導人，他把東西拿走，這裏房宅未燒，他和其餘的下手，究竟椰是受過訓練，有些經騐的男女，大約總已脫險。想到這裏，便也顧不到別的，祇回身對那位領隊說明，要到電廠去，探視鼎元一家，和其他避難的老百姓。</p>
<h3>鑰匙</h3>
<p>— 鳳子</p>
<p>有了一個家，或是有了一問屬於自己的屋子，關起門來可以有範圍以內的享受，起居坐臥，可以依照自己的癖性，不必顧忌有一雙洞照一切的眼睛觀着你，釘着你，無需乎驚惶失措，在这屬於自己所有的環境裏，可以不失去從容的心情，恁什麼事都可以依照自己的愛惡，該怎樣安排的就怎樣安排，該怎樣打發的就怎樣打發。無論窮富智愚，機會能夠給他這樣一個環境，他就沒有理由抱怨老天的不公平。</p>
<p>幸福離不開煩惱，老天總是該受抱怨的。有些人有了一間屋子，還沒有享受到他份內的幸福，煩惱已經像個影子，緊緊的跟着他，心裏像是牽了根練子，手脚像是加了一副鐐銬，屬於自己的那一塊小小的自由天地，而生活在裏面的人，却如同囚進了監牢。動輒易得咎，時時要反省。煩惱一來，問題就多了。一個好性子的人也容易反常，心愛的物件也會親手去砸毀。時刻不離身的東西，有時侯，偏偏失去了方向，或者，明明就在手邊的稿件，正要用到的時侯，千呼萬喚也不肯出來。更有時侯，你會把自己忘記在門外，不管你是疲倦到要死，渴睡到睜不開眼睛，明明一舉手之勞，你便可以像貓一樣蜷伏起來，把自己扔到床上去。可是，老天偏愛同你開玩笑，舉手落了空，一門之隔成了兩個世界，詛咒吧，一個疎忽的人是應該受到懲罰的。罵自己，打自己也沒用，時間可能是深夜，想望中的援助都無法得到，不投奔朋友，只好冒險一顯身手，爬牆跳窗的本領，窘極的時候，任誰也可以扮演下七俠五義裏面的英雄。事後說不定還要自誇天生有飛簷走壁的看家本領，儘管心裏爲自己沒有摔傷碰破而暗暗的慶幸着。無論怎麽个說法，冒險總是不得已的一着。誰也不會存心罰自己過不去，痛苦的是，天生成煩惱是看不見的影子，不定什麼時候會跟蹤而來，扭着你算帳。再聰明的人也沒法討得清靜，除非自己忽然從人海裏減了頂，再也沒有了自己，煩惱才無從生根。</p>
<p>煩惱造成的結果可能十分嚴重，當問題來到時，你就是六尺高的彪形大漢也沒用，你可以一拳打死人，你沒法把自己變成各種各樣的形體，鑽進到各種各樣的孔眼裏去。這時候，正人君子也恨不生有小偷一樣的聰明，一塊鐵片，一根鉛絲，可以予取予求。人的社會裏，一天存在有靠聰明吃飯的竊賊，於是人的煩惱也就永遠沒法消除。惟其如此，煩惱變成了寄生的植物，那裏也可以生根，攀絲牽籘，遠至朋友，近自親人，甚至同床的夫妻，很多都私下暗藏一把看不見的鑰匙，趁機會都想偷偷檢查一下對方的秘寗。怨不了做父母的偏心，偏心原於私念，私念起於利害得失。無論感情的，物質的，一切從自己出發，人與人之間最難得的是信任，而最容易喪失人的感情的也在於無法信任人。</p>
<p>有什麽辦法呢，你說？</p>
<p>看起來，都市生活最可羨慕的是高樓大廈，可是，層層高樓，重重門戶，生活在裏面的人，也許都很幸福，有幾個人，可以自由的出入？即使是屬於他自己的那一小方天下，打開房門，還少不了櫥櫃抽屜的封鎖，封鎖誰呢？身上揣一串鑰匙，叮噹的聲音，是歌頌自己的聰明，還是諷刺自己的愚蠢？萬一疎忽的時候，鑰匙的主人，可就要把自己封鎖進煩惱的地獄裏。這時候，可該怨誰呢？</p>
<p>我從心裏詛咒鑰匙，從早到晚，出進上下，吃飯入厠，這一串鑰匙，總是影子樣的跟着我，而且總擱在視綫半尺以內。遺失了鑰匙等於還失了自己，我被關在門外過，我曾冒險爬過四層高樓的窗戶，……結果，我不能不把它當作我的影子，一個最親的人也不可能一分一秒不離開我，可是，我一點也不喜歡它，它給我的只有煩惱，它威脅着我的自由，它增加了我對人的不信任。甚至對我自己，日夜惦着，念着的結果，我懷疑自己神经是否健全了。可是，我沒有勇氣扔掉它，除非我離去這個世界。</p>
<p>什麼時候可以扔掉這根練子，打碎這副鐐鑄，跳出這座囚牢，飛向眞正自由的天地裏去呢？</p>
<p>世界上會有這麼一個地方麼？道不拾遺，夜不閉戶……孩子們來到世上，長大了入了學校，讀到歷史，才上博物院去參觀這聰明的祖先留下的愚蠢的遺物—鑰匙和鎖。假如真有這麼一天，世界上將永遠也沒有戰爭了吧。</p>

<h3>暴跳</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「天無聲，惟人言之」</p>
<p>然而人言相加爲信，倘非信，那就人言可畏了。我們看到四日本市美鈔的一陣颶風式的漲風，迫得市場混亂，錢兌業公會不得不採取停止美鈔交易的緊急處置，而起因卻在一條「外匯掛牌將隨時作適當調整」消息，更增我們報人立言記事臨淵履冰的戒懼心情與態度。</p>
<p>市場的神經原極尖銳敏感，翻雲覆雨，經常已在製造謠言，倘使再給它一星星穿　附會的機會，又怎能免去不乘機興風作浪。自然，在漲跌投機中，若幹人發了橫財，但大多數人遭了殃。抗戰以前，經濟情況穩定，投機買賣祇限於少數人，影響於市場及人民生計還不大，可是現在，價所謂牽一髮而動全身，美鈔，黃金，棉紗，白米，……任何一樣漲落，全部物價都隨之而有變化，所以那少數人所發的橫財，硬生生都是從我們大多數人的生活上壓榨擄奪得去的。</p>
<p>在這裏，得頌讚中央銀行總裁貝祖貽先生，從就任以來，他一直保持著決不說話的作風，而沉默地在策　與投機家苦鬥惡門。他的苦鬥惡鬥經友經歷，已有了三次，八月的外匯新調整，九月下旬的美鈔波動，以及此次的暴漲，此外尚有若幹大大小小的金融調節事件，像這次，央行猛拋兩千條烚亦，有大氣魄，是遏止了漲風的一道有力主流，從這些地方，我們可以明白主其事者還並未疏忽其責任。</p>
<h3>華人與派司</h3>
<p>— 紅雨</p>
<p>抗戰以前，上海租界裏，全是洋人的勢力，雖然地域在中國，而洋人待遇華人的平等，卻筆難盡述。</p>
<p>就把英商的電車公司來說罷，洋人買月季票，手續簡單，絕對不要照片的。華人則麻煩就多了，先要簽一份不可違背他們公司規章的契約，然後由他發給一張通知單，到他們指定的一家照相館裏去拍照，才算手續完備，還得隔上三五天，方可取到那張所謂，「電車派司」，</p>
<p>他們的理由是，洋人（包括日人白俄在內）個個守信用講道義，所以月季票上，不必用照片。華人倘使不用照片，一定自已不用，借給他人，他人不用，還要轉借與第三人。這樣一來，漫無考查，容易使電車公司受到損失。所以華人買月季票，必須黏上照片。這簡直是在侮辱華人，也怪華人　不爭氣，倘使能同心協力，不去乘坐他的話，看這英商電車公司，要不關門。</p>
<p>但是在淪陷時期，該公司改了「軍管理」後，日本人把「東亞共榮圈」來籠絡我們同胞，居然電車派司上的照片一律取消了。這我們決不會感謝他的優惠待遇，因爲他早已把我們的照片，貼在須隨時由他檢查的「市民證」上了。</p>
<p>大地光復，上海租界已經收回，電車公司雖然還是英商接辦，可是卻受我們市政府公用局的節制了。那知道我今日電車派司，依舊恢復老樣子，華人還須貼照片，並且從前的照片，是公司免費贈拍，如今卻要自辦了，這樣豈不是變本加厲了嗎？</p>
<h3>麻木</h3>
<p>— 喟然</p>
<p>公用局是管　他的，有權可以著令撤廢含有侮辱性的貼在月季票上的照片的。特地爲文供獻意見，還請公用局怏怏實施啊！</p>
<p>讀十月三日本報出版界　，危言君的「地較長的審查」篇後，益覺得不但我們政府的行政效率的迂緩，就是民間的辦事速率，也慢得無可比擬！</p>
<p>筆者是個中學地理教師，上學期教的初中本國地理課本，是中華本。在第二冊第一章福建省課內，有關於臺灣的一節，還是「……東瀕臺灣海峽，適當東海南海往來的要衝，和失去的臺灣島相望。」第二節廣東省：「所謂租借地，便是雷州半島東岸的廣州灣。……於光緒二十四年，爲法人所占，第二年訂約租給他們，定期九十九年，法人在這裏闢爲完全軍港」雲雲。</p>
<p>當時距離勝利，已經有四個月了，曾經想到書賈爲什麼這樣麻木？還不兩節修正呢？也許爲了手續上來不及，所以隨便的發生了出來。可是又是半年了，本學期發給學生讀的第二冊地理課本，依舊關於這兩節絲毫沒有變更。最奇怪的，按查他的出版日期，是三十年八月。我正不明白，上學期不是大鬧課本荒嗎？怎麼到本學期學生所讀的課本，還有三十年印的呢？在三十五年讀三十年印的課本，原是無所謂。不過經歷了一番時代大轉變，恰巧在這幾年裏，地理卻不能含糊。而現在我所發見的，已有上項二大毛病，還有其他不合現在應用的地方，想必壓根兒沒有修正呢。</p>
<p>再看看過去日本人，對於地理研究，是多麼重視。據說在日本可以找到一家書店，是專門門發售中國地興的。在京滬淪陷期間，敵人對於教育方面的工作，第一件事便是改換地理教科書，沒收書店和各圖書館的地圖，就在這個慘痛的對照之下，我們自已頗覺雅已勝利，仍感慚愧。讀了危言先生這一節引言，再反映著我所教的那本地理書，豈止慚愧，簡直覺得教育當局和出版商是一般的麻木呢</p>
<h3>據說有這樣事　一睡三十九年</h3>
<p>— 加另譯自Journal　of　Amreican　Pharmaeutical　Associltion　July　1946</p>
<p>生存是每一個人的基本慾望，但是厭惡和不滿現實卻也是人的通性。很有些人想長相當的時期，暫時離開這紛擾的世界，若幹年後蘇醒過來，再過新的生活。所以在「利伯大夢」Rip　Van　Winkle的故事中，這位利伯就一睡二十年，醒來世界變遷了，故人不相識了，彷佛置身另一個新世界中。</p>
<p>最近美國的動物學家發現了一種圓蟲Nematodes長眠了二倍於利伯的時間——卅九年之久。這蟲學名是Tylenchus　Polyhypnus有五條這種蟲安眠在一片已經保藏了卅九年的乾麥葉上面。這樣長的睡眠時間的蟲，在動物界裏創了新記錄</p>
<h3>孟母三遷</h3>
<p>— 罔悟</p>
<p>蔔鄰翁某，熟讀古書，此次「回」滬，寓所被佔，然而「回」也不改其樂！近頃思想革新，爲孫兒謀一妥善的教育環境，追步孟母三遷之意，從曹家渡搬到南市，又從南市喬遷到愚園路，最近又另覓新居於馬斯南路，田產變賣所殆盡，吾心安矣雲。</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 戈枕</p>
<p>審奸奇聞</p>
<p>華北頭號漢奸王揖唐被判死刑後，突在北平各報大登廣告，謂審理該案的審判長何承倬，是他「治下之小漢奸。」以「奸」審奸，（括符內的小漢奸審頭號大漢奸）一奇；</p>
<p>王逆揖唐既然早知承審者係其「治下之小漢奸」，當時裝死不說，爲什麼不在那時當堂暴露，而竟留至事後才揭發，此中是否有文章，外人不得而知，二奇；</p>
<p>有人說，這也許是「狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心」，因爲括符號的漢奸，是真漢奸，或是地下工作者，我們不敢懸揣，但看看報紙，何承倬自己似乎並不否認，而且並未提及地下工作，三奇；</p>
<p>北平各報，似乎對何承倬漢奸嫌疑問題也並不忌諱，否則他們決不致於貿然刊登這種不負責的「漢奸廣告」。（此例一開，將來漢奸廣告必多！）爲袒護王揖唐嗎？爲攻擊何承倬嗎？爲貪圖廣告收入嗎？好像都不是，然而也好像都有關係，四奇；</p>
<p>堂堂一個審判長，遭已判死刑的王逆揖唐反咬一口，就司法尊嚴和大官威信而論，實在「太那個」了！五奇；</p>
<p>王揖唐幾時執行死刑，現在尚未可預料，說不定還要申請覆判，甚至還可能發展出「案中案」，六奇！狗咬呂洞賓乎？</p>
<h3>今日點心</h3>
<p>— WW</p>
<p>跑馬蛋，（靠賽馬增加政府收入，無異「殺馬求蛋。」）</p>
<p>苦清茶，（這只好委屈諸位，因爲清查諸公也夠苦了。）</p>
<h3>被刦記</h3>
<p>— 一丹</p>
<p>天涼未寒時，歹徒們竟已開始蠶動了。</p>
<p>小南門外的滬杭甬車站及其附近，於滬戰時德遭敵彈的濫炸，如今勝利了一年多，猶爲一片　野。</p>
<p>要是從大同大學到華商電氣公司，就須越過這片距約數百碼的曠野，中間沒有崗亭，沒有路燈，底有荒草亂磚，水　泥溝，夜來益形冷落，每使行人惴惴不安，車夫也視爲畏途。</p>
<p>前幾天晚十時光景，鄰居老孫，甫經大同大學，即爲一歹徒追逼上來，破顫帽，油垢破碎的上裝，手操「家夥」，喝聲往那裏走？當被劫雲法幣約三萬元，以用手帕擲煙等物，繼即向其猛力一推，從隱蔽處復竄出同黨一人，隨之消失於黑暗中。</p>
<p>像這樣的路劫，似乎可視作小事，但是看到深入一點，就會覺得是一個社會問題，也是一個城郊的治安問題，現在，在未能根本解決之前，擬退墾請該管蓬萊區當局，於那邊設立警亭一座，派警駐守，亭頂裝置一個紅燈，其效果當不下於黑海中的燈塔，否則朔風凜冽時，歹徒輩更可橫行無忌了。我們行人怎麼只呢？</p>
<p>星·期·雜·談</p>
<p>〔編者按：一周中，我們供給各位讀者的精神食品，新聞性太濃了，也許失之嚴肅，因此特在星期天闢一個無所不談的「星期雜談」這一盤星期菜，我們希望能夠做到輕鬆而辛辣，但又不與營養的原則相背。〕</p>
<h3>請你想一想</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>你想一想：下列情形，與你下意識符合嗎？</p>
<p>（一）對於人家要求，嘴裏滿口答應，心裏「一眼　啥」；老子說：「輕諾者必寡信。」你就是這一種人嗎？</p>
<p>（二）當你做媳婦的時候，到處訴說婆婆的不是，而當你兒子娶了媳婦時，你又處處訴說「兒子有了老婆，不要老母了！」你想想看，你自己是否如此？</p>
<p>（三）你是不是以爲父母墳墓的「風水」好不好，會影響到你的富貴，因此便找遍看「風水」的先生，替父母安葬，而對外卻以此表揚你的孝道？</p>
<p>（四）當你在父母的喪貼上印上「不孝等罪孽深重，不　殞滅，　延先考……等等樣時，你知道這是「天字第一號」的胡說嗎？</p>
<h3>局外人看法</h3>
<p>— 怠</p>
<p>這是延安的辯證法：假使毛澤東做了「中華民國蘇維埃人民委員會」主席兼黨的總書記，周恩來一定是外交人民委員會的委員長，當然朱德是中華民國紅軍的最高統帥了，「論功行賞」應如是。</p>
<p>一個青年說：「在民國政府治下，要一步爬到什麼主席委員之類可真太不容易，要是加入共產黨說不定幾天以後就可以拿到一張某某委員的任狀呢！」</p>
<p>一個辦黨的人說，辦黨的目的是取得政權，誰能否認這句話，一個加入某黨的人說：這是冒險求官的捷徑！</p>
<h3>寫給家長們</h3>
<p>— 鶴松</p>
<p>孩子從學校裏回來了，挾著書包，書包裹是書和許多筆記簿，練習簿，孩子覺得很高興，因爲一天的課程，總算已經完畢了，可以痛快的玩一會。</p>
<p>母親接過了書包，將筆記簿練習簿一本本翻開來，對孩子說，這裏不對，那裏錯了；還有，算術爲什麼才七十分，國文爲什麼不得「超」？</p>
<p>孩子的「高興」變成憂愁，他想：這就是他學習一天的代價！</p>
<p>就好的方面說，這孩子被母親的活激起了做「優等生」的心，從此就更用功的讀書；就壞的方面說，這孩子從此覺得他的努力卻是浪費，而消極，而灰心。</p>
<p>謹向家長們過個忠告，別盡苛責孩子，而相反的，應時時予孩子以鼓勵！鼓勵是較苛責更有效的。</p>
<p>每當一個孩子的新鞋子穿上腳時，他的母親總要對他說：「喂，這回可別把鞋子糟蹋了呀，再糟蹋就沒有鞋子給你穿了！」</p>
<p>因此，孩子不敢跑，怕跑壞了鞋子，不敢跳，怕跳壞了鞋子；不敢遊戲，不敢運動！鞋子限制了一切，成了孩子們的鐐銬。</p>
<p>但是，賢明的家長們，你們得知道，使孩子們動，遊戲，是多麼重要的事件事……別爲了「鞋子」犧牲了下一代的健康！</p>
<p>不久以前，曾經發生過一件事：一個小學五年級的學生，因爲不能升級而自殺。</p>
<p>我們可以想像得到，當那個孩子知道「留級」後，他的父母一定曾予以嚴厲的責備——甚或予以一頓打。（事實上，這種事我也見過多次了。）孩子受不了這種責罰，竟就此輕生。</p>
<p>我不是鼓勵孩子留級，但是我想告訴諸位，學校的分數並不能正確地指示出孩子的「好」「壞」，而學習上挫阻，（如留級），也正是正常的現象。別以爲孩子留級就是沒出息，就是不可教，而組予難堪的懲罰！</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Preparations Are Actively Underway; Most Representatives Have Been Selected; The Lists of Various Parties Are Being Expedited</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] The convocation order for the National Assembly was not issued on the 2nd as scheduled. The government is currently discussing the matter to ensure perfection. On the morning of the 2nd, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Hong Lanyou, and others gathered on the second floor of the Central Party Headquarters to discuss the issue until 12:00 noon. Afterwards, they declined to offer any opinions. According to what this reporter has learned, the National Assembly Organization Law only stipulates that the National Assembly is convened by the National Government, without specifying a convocation date. Furthermore, the period for representatives to register is only set as "before the 10th." Therefore, according to the Organization Law, it would not be impossible to issue the convocation order as late as November 1st. However, when it was previously decided to hold the meeting on May 5th, the convocation order was issued on March 25th, and registration was set for April 25th. Therefore, if the above decision is taken as an example, the current timeline is indeed too tight. However, given the current situation, the government is still considering whether to take the next step. According to the person in charge of the National Assembly election authority, most of the representatives have already been selected, and the lists of various parties are being expedited. Some say that it is possible to issue the convocation order on October 12th and hold the opening ceremony as scheduled, then temporarily suspend the meeting and reconvene it after the national issues are resolved. However, whether this approach is feasible is currently unknown. It is also rumored that Chairman Deng Zhong, regarding this preliminary constitutional National Assembly, has been paying close attention to it recently.</p>
<p>The Convocation Order for the National Assembly Will Be Announced; A Decision Can Be Made Before the 12th</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 4th] Hong Lanyou stated on the 4th that the date for the announcement of the National Assembly convocation order will definitely be determined before the 12th. Regarding the request of alternate National Assembly representatives to attend the meeting, Hong said that it would be decided by the National Assembly Presidium, but there is no provision for alternate representatives in the organizational law.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] As of noon, the Communist Party has not yet sent a formal reply to the government's statement issued on the 2nd. The attitude of the Communist Party can already be seen in the remarks made yesterday by Chen Jiakang, the Communist Party's spokesperson in Shanghai. Tonight, Mei Yi, the spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation here, stated that the formal reply has not yet arrived. Currently, we have two goals: first, an urgent demand for a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou. If the war continues, the future is truly unimaginable. Second, this ceasefire should be unconditional and should be implemented immediately, not after the military operations have reached the suburbs of Zhangjiakou. He also stated that the Communist Party's memorandum to the government regarding the ceasefire in Zhangjiakou has not yet received a response from the government. At 4:00 PM on the 5th, Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart based on the above two points and exchanged views on the ceasefire issue.</p>
<h3>Three-Quarters of the 2,050 Representatives Have Been Elected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] With the National Assembly about to convene, the selection of various representatives is being expedited by the relevant authorities. According to the provisions of the election law and the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly will have a total of 2,050 representatives. Currently, 1,566 representatives have been legally selected, while 484 have not yet been selected. Regarding the selection of National Assembly representatives and the distribution of their quotas, the person in charge of the National Assembly Election Office recently provided the following details to this reporter: The number of National Assembly representatives, according to the revised and promulgated National Assembly Representative Election Law of May 1937, was originally distributed as follows: 1. 665 representatives elected by regional election methods (including 30 units in various provinces and cities). 2. 380 representatives elected by occupational election methods (including various agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups in various provinces and cities and national freelance professional groups). 3. 145 representatives elected by special election methods (including 45 from the Northeast, 40 from Mongolia and Tibet, 40 from overseas Chinese, and 30 from the military). 4. 240 representatives designated by the National Government, for a total of 1,440 representatives. Except for item 4, 1,200 representatives should be selected according to the procedures stipulated in the election law. In 1937, due to the situation, only 950 representatives were selected. Furthermore, due to changes in the situation over the past nine years, some representatives in various regions have defected, died, or been removed from office, and there were no alternates to fill the vacancies, resulting in 28 vacancies. Therefore, only 922 of the originally elected representatives remain. In January of this year, the government convened a political consultative conference with various parties, and there was an agreement on the number of National Assembly representatives. In addition to retaining the 1,200 representatives stipulated in the original election law, the 240 representatives designated by the government were canceled and changed to: 1. 700 representatives directly selected by the National Government, including the following: A. 320 representatives of the Kuomintang. B. 190 representatives of the Communist Party. C. 120 representatives of the Democratic League. D. 100 representatives of the Youth Party. E. 70 representatives of non-party and non-factional social elites. 2. 150 representatives added in accordance with the supplementary regulations attached to the election amendment, including the following: (1) 17 newly added representatives from Taiwan (together with the 1 representative stipulated in the election law to be elected by overseas Chinese and allocated to Taiwan, totaling 18 representatives). (2) 77 newly added representatives from the twelve provinces and cities of the Northeast (together with the original quota of 45 representatives from the provinces and cities of the Northeast stipulated in the election law, totaling 122 representatives from the provinces and cities of the Northeast). (3) 6 representatives from Chongqing City (the election law stipulated that the city did not elect representatives separately). (4) 3 newly added occupational representatives from Xikang Province. (5) 1 representative from Ereen Banner. (6) 1 representative from the Amdo Tibetan area. (7) 1 representative from overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom. (8) 1 representative from overseas Chinese from Yunnan in Burma. (9) 10 representatives from indigenous ethnic groups in the six provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi. (10) 10 newly added representatives from the military. (11) 20 women representatives. The above items added a total of 850 representatives, which, together with the 1,200 representatives originally stipulated in the election law, totaled 2,050 representatives. Now that the government has decided to hold the National Assembly on November 12th as scheduled, the selection of various representatives is being expedited by the National Assembly Election Office. As of now, a total of 1,566 representatives have been legally selected, of which 1,035 have been announced, and 531 are about to be announced. In addition, among the 484 representatives who have not yet been selected, 190 are Communist Party representatives, 120 are Democratic League representatives, and 100 are Youth Party representatives, totaling 410, who have not yet submitted their lists. The remaining 74 representatives who have not yet been selected are also being expedited separately. It is expected that all of them can be selected before the start of the assembly registration, so as not to affect the number of attendees.</p>

There was fighting within five kilometers around Baoding. The Communist army was still fiercely attacking at 2:00 AM on the 5th, five miles northwest of the city, attempting to actively threaten the provincial government's location.

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Southeastern Chahar Province; Fu Zuoyi Cables That Nanchaoqian Has Been Recovered; Chen Cheng Holds a Military Conference in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 5th] As of noon on the 5th, the war in Chahar Province, southeastern part, was still raging in the areas around Wuziying, Maquanzi, Huoshaoying, and Xinzhuang, about five li east of Huailai City. The National Army arrived in this area on the 2nd and has been engaged in a tug-of-war with the Communist army for four days, which has been quite fierce, showing the Communist army's determination to hold Zhangjiakou. The National Army also sent another force north from Nankou, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army in the area twenty li south of Yanqing. The Communist army in the Huailai area has thirty regiments, more than 30,000 people, personally commanded by Nie Rongzhen, and their designation is the Ji-Cha-Wei-Jiang Two Columns. In addition, the Communist army has increased its forces by six regiments in the areas northeast of Nankou and Changping, attempting to disrupt the rear. According to a cable sent by Fu Zuoyi yesterday to the relevant parties here, the cavalry regiment recovered Nanchaoqian in southwestern Chahar on the 1st and is continuing to advance. Nanchaoqian belongs to Shangdu and is a must-contend place in this battle. According to a military strategist who is directing operations in Chahar Province this time, based on past combat experience, the National Army on this route may tend towards Wanquan. Once Wanquan is taken, it can take a commanding position and directly attack Zhangjiakou. In the past, the struggle for Zhangjiakou has also taken this route, so taking Zhangjiakou from this route will be faster than other routes. The military authorities also stated that the too rapid progress in western Chahar may affect the "decisive battle" in eastern Chahar. According to Communist personnel, the Communist army's combat principle is to use troops along the "exchange of interests line," that is, to avoid the heavy and take the light, and not hesitate to abandon strongholds. Therefore, the outcome of the decisive battle in eastern Chahar is still unpredictable, but it is clear that the main force of the Communist army is deployed in eastern Chahar. Regarding the Communist army's retreat after losing Zhangjiakou, it is generally said that it will be in the area of Yuxian and even Taishan. The arrival of Chief of Staff Chen in Beiping will bring the Chahar-Hebei war to an early end.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 5th] Amid the tense atmosphere of the Chahar-Hebei war, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew to Beiping from Beijing last night around 7:00 PM. Only Commander Sun Lianzhong went to the airport to welcome him, and few outside knew about it. The two entered the city directly to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the news was that Chen was presiding over a military conference, with Director Li Zongren and the chief of staff of the Executive Headquarters attending. Chen spent the night at Sun Lianzhong's residence and continued the meeting on the 5th. It is not yet known when Chen will leave Beiping.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the orders of Chairman Chiang, accompanied by many personnel, to direct the Baoding war.</p>

As a result, only the American representative, Colonel Hurns, and the government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Ma Junzhi, departed by car. However, because the bridge at kilometer 52 east of Tiande Station on the Siping-Meihekou road was destroyed by the Communist Army, they could not proceed and returned to Siping at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to a telephone call from Siping, regarding the capture of Xifeng County by the Communist Army, the government representative of the 28th Small Group of the Military Mediation Department, Ma Junzhi, in addition to submitting a memorandum to the American representative, Colonel Hurns, also lodged a serious protest to the Communist representative, Zhang Songtao, demanding that the Communist Army withdraw unconditionally, and sternly condemned the Communist Army's illegal action in attacking Xifeng.

<h3>A Strong Navy Benefits World Peace; The Construction of Coastal Defense Cannot Be Delayed; Gui Yongqing Talks About How We Should Seize the Opportunity</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] Vice Admiral Gui Yongqing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, met with this reporter at 5:00 PM on the 5th to discuss his thoughts and plans for building a new navy in the future. He stated: "In addition to requiring developed industry, abundant financial resources, and sufficient talent, a good international environment is especially important for the establishment of a navy. Before the war, all of our national defense construction was strongly hindered by the Japanese invaders. Now, all the major powers of the world are allies, and because of this war, they all know that if China has a strong navy, it will actually benefit world peace. Therefore, the current international situation is the best opportunity for us to build coastal defense. The first problem we encounter in this major task is manpower. The training of naval personnel must emphasize both technology and will. In the future, naval education must be improved day by day, and it is planned to establish connections with relevant departments of various universities to recruit outstanding young people to participate in naval construction. Secondly, shipbuilding. If we want to seek the development and independence of the Chinese navy in the future, we must be able to set up factories to build ships and cannot rely on foreign countries for everything. This will start with maintenance and repair and gradually expand until we can manufacture ships ourselves. Thirdly, the establishment of a management system, which is a necessary condition for any military service. The scope of the navy is especially broad. Without a transparent, efficient, and practical management system, building a new navy will be impossible. The Navy General Headquarters is currently changing its organization and will set up five departments and eight divisions, which are expected to be completed within the next week. In the future, it will follow the instructions of the Chairman and Commander-in-Chief Chen, and actively carry out work with the assistance of compatriots across the country and various allies." He concluded by saying that once the official duties in the General Headquarters are in order, he plans to go to various naval bases and ports to inspect, so as to truly understand the current situation of the navy and promote outstanding personnel on the spot.</p>
<h3>Change of Command Ceremony for the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA); Addresses by Outgoing and Incoming Directors, Mr. Huo and Mr. Chiang, Encouraging Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] When CNRRA Director Chiang Ting-fu recently went to Nanjing, he was instructed by Premier Song to first handle the change of command. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by the newly appointed Director Huo Baoshu, he held the change of command ceremony in the conference room on the fourth floor of CNRRA headquarters. All 700+ CNRRA staff members in Shanghai attended. As of today, Director Huo officially assumes his duties.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang's Farewell Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang stated briefly in his address: The main purpose of today's ceremony is to give everyone the opportunity to meet the new Director. Before the new Director speaks, I would like to say a few words to express my sincere feelings. Over the past year, colleagues in the headquarters and various branch offices have made their best efforts to promote the work of CNRRA and have made many sacrifices. I would like to thank them for this. CNRRA is a large-scale service organization, so those who participate in its work must take the spirit of service as their fundamental principle. I sincerely hope that you will remove prejudices of party affiliation and political views and continue to serve humanity. If the new Director welcomes you to continue to participate in CNRRA's work, then I sincerely hope that you will continue to work with peace of mind and with the same spirit of service. Deputy Director Li has jointly planned CNRRA's work with me. Now that he has been appointed by the government, he should continue CNRRA's work. As for myself, the government has given me the opportunity to serve humanity. Now that you have the opportunity to serve humanity, you should continue to work hard. The new Director has more experience than I do and is fully capable of CNRRA's work, and his performance will certainly be better than mine.</p>
<p>Mr. Huo's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Huo's speech stated briefly: CNRRA is an organization born out of the times. It is a relief organization established based on the Atlantic Charter. Its main purpose is to serve the people. Director Chiang once said, "From a historical perspective, there will inevitably be years of famine after a major war. This kind of post-war disaster will last for 30 to 50 years. I am determined to help humanity reduce this post-war disaster and shorten its duration from decades to two or three years." I know that CNRRA's work is the most arduous work in history. At the same time, there are various difficulties that prevent its work from being fully deployed, and the general public does not easily understand these difficulties. Director Chiang has laid the foundation for us. Now that he is unwilling to continue working for personal reasons, and I, as someone outside of government, have been ordered by the government to succeed Mr. Chiang in leading CNRRA, I sincerely hope that you will help me accelerate the completion of CNRRA's mission. Today, I have three hopes for CNRRA's work: (1) to establish close ties with UNRRA and all parties and to integrate with UNRRA's work; (2) to discuss work openly. The amount of CNRRA's materials and the situation are unclear to all parties, and there are excessive demands. In the future, we must generally discuss and study work with the public; (3) I hope that you will work harder and with peace of mind, race against time, reduce human suffering, and assist in world peace. In addition, I have two points to express to CNRRA colleagues: First, I hope that there will be no major changes in personnel. I hope you will help me with my work as you helped Director Chiang; second, in order to race against time, CNRRA's work period is already very short. I hope that you will complete urgent and important work as soon as possible, coordinate work with action, and complete CNRRA's work plan. What I have said below is not only my hope, but also Director Chiang's hope, and even more so the mission that the government has given us. Finally, I hope that Mr. Chiang will give me instructions at any time and in any place.</p>

<h3>CNRRA Food Survey Team Report: Famine Threatens Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong; National Relief Grain Needs Exceed 800,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Report from This City] According to a report from the CNRRA Food Survey Team: Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces still face a famine crisis this winter. This year's national grain harvest is only about 10% less than in peacetime. The grain harvest in some provinces is more than 40% less. Floods and the lack of seeds, agricultural tools, and fertilizers are the main reasons for the poor harvest. It is estimated that the country will need 812,000 tons of relief grain to supply our farmers to get through this winter and next spring. Based on current transportation capacity limitations, CNRRA and UNRRA can supply 553,000 tons of food by next spring, which is still 250,000 tons short of the total national grain needs. The grain needs in various parts of the country, except for a few counties in Jiangxi province that have surplus harvests, are insufficient in other provinces such as Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Taiwan, the Nine Northeastern Provinces, Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, etc. The grain needs in Shanghai alone are estimated at around 4,000 tons. Since the start of its work, CNRRA has distributed a total of 559,492 tons of grain to various parts of the country by the beginning of September. As of September 15, 520,061 tons unloaded by UNRRA at various ports in China are being distributed by CNRRA to various regions or are being reassembled. UNRRA shipments to China that need to be reassembled include approximately 8,111 tons of agricultural machinery, mostly agricultural tractors. CNRRA has distributed 1 million pounds of seeds, enough to plant 2 million mu of land, to farmers across the country. Other items include 552,000 pounds of pesticides and 64,169,000 pounds of fertilizer, which have also been distributed by CNRRA to various regions for use.</p>
<h3>Missing Plane of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC); Search Yields No Results; Obstruction by the Lolo People in Puge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] According to sketchy news received here today, CNAC Flight 81 crashed in the wilderness of the Lolo area on the 15th. The personnel and passengers on board, in addition to being frightened, also exchanged fire with the Lolo people. CNAC has dispatched a transport plane to rescue them in order to determine whether the pilot, Long Barton, and the passengers are safe. However, yesterday's reconnaissance yielded no results. The CNAC rescue plane was piloted by American pilot Bo Smith. The plane dropped a long strip of cloth with messages written in Chinese and the Lolo language, meaning that if there were any survivors from the plane that crashed in the Lolo area, they could send a signal. The Lolo people, upon seeing this, fired at the plane, hitting the tail. In addition to Bo Smith, the pilots of the CNAC rescue plane included Anderson, Froster, and Cox, who has jumped from an airplane 1,098 times. It was planned that would jump into the Lolo area if necessary to directly assist in the rescue of the crashed plane. However, due to poor visibility today, there were also no results. The initial report about the personnel and passengers on the CNAC plane exchanging fire with the Lolo people came from a letter from Wu Guojian, the head of a township in Puge (180 li southeast of Xichang). He Guoguang, the Xichang garrison commander, has dispatched 17 personnel, including family members of the passengers, a Catholic priest, and doctors, but the Lolo people have only allowed two people to enter, one Lolo person and one person dispatched by Mr. He. According to a telegram from He in Xichang: "The crashed plane landed in Abulu Lu Lu Bu village. The Lolo people in the vicinity are even willing to do their best to protect the victims. Please notify the passengers' families to send clothes, food, and medical supplies." The Lolo people may want to use this as a price for releasing the people. The Lolo people are not on good terms with each other. Even with a Lolo person accompanying them, the rescue personnel cannot guarantee that they will be able to pass through all the Lolo areas to reach their destination.</p>

<h3>Hao Yongde, the Culprit of the Wanpaoshan Incident 20 Years Ago, Captured; Changchun War Criminal Investigation Committee Begins Investigation</h3>

The Wanpaoshan Incident was the prelude to the September 18th Incident. At that time, in order to prevent the joint resistance of the Chinese and Korean nations when creating the incident, the Japanese first instigated Korean farmers in the Wanpaoshan area in July to dig a river to divert water and destroy tens of thousands of mu of Chinese farmland. The local Chinese farmers rose up in opposition and clashed with the Japanese police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The Japanese further spread propaganda to the Koreans, reversing right and wrong, and falsely accusing China of oppressing Korean farmers. Koreans in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places, not knowing the truth, rioted, destroyed shops of overseas Chinese, and massacred overseas Chinese in various places. Hao Yongde and others took bribes and acted in concert with the Koreans, acting as accomplices.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Legendary Three-Headed Meeting</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace delivered a speech advocating for a change in the U.S.'s tough foreign policy towards the Soviet Union; Stalin told reporters that he believed the world was not on the brink of war; former British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden delivered a speech advocating for reconciliation with the Soviet Union in a new spirit and with new approaches, and Stalin welcomed it the next day; U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes gave a speech in Paris advocating for a 40-year treaty with Germany; Molotov suddenly returned home on the 4th of this month for instructions: With this series of events, the talk of a meeting between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is rampant. Judging from these developments, it seems that both the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American countries are working hard to improve the current confrontational situation. This is a welcome phenomenon in the international situation, and from China's standpoint, it is even more in line with our expectations.</p>
<p>The world cannot have a third world war now. This is not only the demand of the people of the whole world, but also a limitation of objective reality. The most important countries in the so-called Third World War are of course the United States and the Soviet Union. However, although the United States is rich and powerful, domestic prices are rising, controls cannot be abolished, and labor strikes are frequent, which seems to indicate domestic unrest. Those in power certainly do not want war, and even if they do, it is not easy to overcome the anti-war sentiment of the American people at this time. One only needs to look at General Eisenhower's recent speech, quoting Lincoln's words that "bullets cannot solve problems," to get a glimpse of the general opinion of the American people. As for the Soviet Union, regardless of whether the atomic bomb has been invented or whether the people have the right to oppose war, the domestic economy is tight, and neither heavy industry nor agriculture has recovered. Only with the implementation of the new five-year plan can it be hoped that in four years, they will be able to make one pair of shoes and three pairs of socks per year for each person. Currently, each person only has one pair of socks per year, and one pair of shoes every other year. There is only one single-track railway line from Moscow to Leningrad. The problems of collective farms are rampant, and have recently been published in newspapers. Under such national strength, no matter what, the authorities may not immediately have the ambition to conquer the world. Marshal Stalin's current talk of not wanting war, we deeply believe, is from the heart.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union are in fact unable to fight, yet they are recklessly preparing for war, which is the most contradictory phenomenon. Because of the huge military budget, the United States cannot fully improve domestic livelihood issues; the Soviet Union does not build urgently needed machines for postwar transportation and agriculture in most of its factories, but builds tanks, artillery, rockets, and aircraft, and is doing its utmost to research the manufacturing methods of the atomic bomb. The bread rationing system is not dared to be abolished in order to preserve military supplies for unforeseen circumstances. Although the United States and the Soviet Union are not officially at war, this quasi-war situation has already plunged the livelihoods of their own people into pain.</p>
<p>The creation of this worrying situation should not only be attributed to the psychological fear of each other, but also to the fact that there are indeed several important disputes between countries that cannot be resolved, which is also a major reason. The first is the German question, the second is the Danube opening issue, the third is the Trieste issue, the fourth is the Dardanelles issue, the fifth is the Greek civil war issue, and the sixth is the Korean unification issue. These issues, directly and indirectly, prevent the United States and the Soviet Union from trusting each other and cooperating. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference could not resolve them, and the 21-nation Paris Peace Conference could not resolve them either. Unless the highest authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union reach an understanding and come up with practical issues for appropriate resolution, coupled with Attlee's mediation, all international conferences and negotiations seem unlikely to produce completely satisfactory results. Although President Truman does not believe that a meeting between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can become a reality in the short term, it is probably the most urgent need today. Because only if the heads of state of Truman and Stalin openly propose practical problems and solve them appropriately, with Attlee's mediation in between, can there be a real hope of resolution.</p>
<p>There are some people in the world now who believe that communist countries cannot coexist with capitalist countries in the same world, and that they must either go to war or at least prepare for war. But we believe this is a prejudice and a misconception. Most of the so-called capitalist countries are already democratic countries, and the people have the opportunity to express their opinions freely. Although a few capitalist groups have considerable power to manipulate politics, they cannot completely manipulate it. Once it violates the welfare of the majority of the people, they will inevitably step down. The former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as a hero of national salvation, was finally defeated in the election, which is a clear example. Although many capitalists are unwilling, the continued control of prices in the United States is finally maintained. The seamen's strike also achieved considerable victory. Moreover, from the standpoint of capitalists, except for a very few arms dealers, they also need peace. Only with peace can they have business to do. We guess that the most important motive for Wallace's opposition to Byrnes's policy may be because he is the Secretary of Commerce, and he believes that as long as Byrnes's policy towards the Soviet Union exists, there may be no way to develop US-Soviet trade.</p>
<p>As for communist countries, most of them are economically poorer than capitalist countries, and after the devastation of war, they need peace even more to restore production. Moreover, communism itself is not without flexibility. The current Soviet society is not the ideal Soviet society of the original Bolsheviks. Many theories that violate human nature and cannot be implemented at all have long been gradually changed to accommodate reality. As for the attempt at world revolution, although they have not theoretically abandoned it and may still be dreaming of realizing it, it must be said without hesitation that they have indeed abandoned it many times in fact. As long as the revolutionary opportunity is not ripe and the objective environment does not allow it, reckless and forceful actions will only accelerate the failure of the revolution and its own collapse. The fourteen leaders of the Kremlin are all extremely shrewd people, how can they not know this? Although they seem determined not to give in on the surface, they must in fact have many considerations. Under the right conditions, they may not be willing to embark on a path of temporary compromise.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the current international situation, a meeting of the three major powers is "possible" to break the deadlock, and this deadlock "must" be broken, because all parties have an urgent need. We hope that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee will see clearly the current urgent need, use a frank attitude, and take practical steps to stabilize this turbulent world.</p>
<h3>What Exactly Does the Chinese Communist Party Want?</h3>
<p>Recently, the negotiations on the CCP issue have been deadlocked over the dispute between "three" and "five," and the situation has fallen into extreme depression. After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, the government stated that the five-person conference and the three-person team could be convened at the same time, and the capital had an optimistic atmosphere. Unexpectedly, at this time, the CCP suddenly put forward a memorandum requesting the government to immediately stop all military actions against Zhangjiakou, otherwise it would declare a complete breakdown. Fortunately, the government quickly issued a solemn statement putting forward two concrete suggestions and a final limit of concession for resolving the current situation. As long as the CCP participates in the negotiations and reaches an agreement, a comprehensive ceasefire can be achieved, not just a corner of Zhangjiakou. However, the CCP has not yet given a formal reply.</p>
<p>Although the CCP has not officially replied, the Yan'an Radio Station made an informal statement on the CCP's attitude the day before yesterday, and even further demanded that the National Army withdraw from the areas recovered after January 13 of this year, otherwise the CCP will not participate in the negotiations on the reorganization of the government and will fight to the end. From this, it can be seen that the CCP completely lacks sincerity in peaceful negotiations. Its purpose is not only to stop the war in Zhangjiakou, but also to use its refusal to participate in the negotiations on government reorganization as a means to coerce the government. The CCP's reply is really "irrelevant" and "beside the point," and what it really wants is already obvious. To put it bluntly, the CCP clearly wants to use this coercive method to break the negotiations, make peace hopeless, and plunge China into a state of division.</p>
<p>Looking back on the peace negotiations over the past ten months, talking and fighting, fighting and talking, it is like the weather in the plum rain season, sunny and rainy, rainy and sunny; it is also like suffering from a fever and chills, cold for a while, then hot for a while, then hot for a while, then cold for a while. Standing on an objective position and studying the crux of the current situation, we can see that the price of peace is completely controlled by the CCP. It can turn clouds into rain and do whatever it wants. It will negotiate when it wants to negotiate, and fight when it wants to fight; it will fight when it is advantageous, and negotiate when it is not advantageous; it will fight where it is advantageous, and negotiate where it is not advantageous. And its only reliable tool is to take advantage of the fact that the government and the people both seek peace and are willing to compromise in order to achieve it. Because the government has always adopted a policy of appeasement, the CCP's arrogance has become so rampant. The CCP is superstitious that force is omnipotent. Although the recent counterattack by the National Army has shattered its illusions, it has not yet awakened. The CCP believes that if it wins the war, it can seize the entire central government; if it loses the war, it can split China and become a warlord. It has long inherited the ancient Chinese tradition of "success makes one a king, failure makes one a bandit," believing that it can advance and retreat with ease. But here, we must remind the CCP of one thing: the story of Shi Jingtang is to be despised by all generations.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Recovered Areas Gradually Recovering; Dikes Breached Have Been Reconnected, Three Banks Allocate Loans</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] When the communist troops retreated from Huaiyin on September 19th, they breached the Grand Canal dikes in four places. The water rushed south, flooding over two hundred miles of land all the way to Gaoyou. The losses to the people were incalculable. After the National Army moved in, they rushed to block the breaches day and night and the reconnection was completed the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] The Ministry of Finance, due to the communist troops in the recovered areas having arbitrarily issued various counterfeit banknotes, has prohibited their circulation, resulting in a local financial shortage. In the Northern Jiangsu area, it has approved the allocation of 500 million yuan by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China to be lent out by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Xuzhou 5th dispatch] Postal services in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu are actively seeking to recover. The postmasters of Huaiyin Post Office, Zhang Wenzhi; Huaian, Liu Deyu; Bao Ying, Cha Songnian; and Gaoyou, Song Tianmin, departed from Xuzhou on the 5th to take up their posts and prepare for the restoration of postal services. Furthermore, postal services between Jinxiang and Xuzhou were restored on the 27th of last month.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Xuzhou 5th dispatch] The Tongshan Telecommunications Bureau is actively restoring telecommunications in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu. The leader of the 3rd Telecommunications Communications Team, Yao Daoxin, departed from Xuzhou on the 1st to prepare in Suqian. It is now known that telecommunications between Xuzhou and Suqian were opened on the 2nd, and telecommunications between Xuzhou and Huai'an can also be reported by the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] The Huaiyin market has not fully recovered. Prices are slightly higher than at the time of the recovery. Pork, which originally sold for only 300 yuan per catty, now sells for 800 yuan. The abolition of Anti-Japanese currency has caused considerable losses to the people, but there are no complaints. Small denominations of legal tender are lacking, and copper coins, etc., are used instead, with a small copper coin worth five yuan. Disputes such as land issues and marriage issues are not as numerous as imagined. The land still belongs to the owners, and the tenant farmers continue to cultivate it. The political department of the garrison has written large slogans on the streets: "Respect the customs and habits of the cities." Everything is quickly returning to normal. The field tax was explicitly suspended last year. Whether the field tax will be levied this year, the county government has not yet received orders. If it is levied, the people will have nothing to pay. The communist troops have taken away a large amount of supplies. If it is not levied, the county government will have no source of revenue.

<h3>Nantong News - Half of the People on the Streets Are Refugees... The Harshness and Cruelty of the Communist Area Is Unbearable to Hear</h3>
<p>[Nantong News] I stayed in Nantong for a week this time, and the impression I got was terrible. In my memory, Nantong was a prosperous, lively, and modern city. After arriving in Shanghai, I wanted to go back to Nantong for a visit. After the victory, it was the first place in northern Jiangsu to be recovered, and everything should have been revived. Who would have thought that the neatness and grandeur of the Zhang Jian era have now become disorganized and decadent. The reputation of a model county has become a thing of the past. If Zhang Zhuangyuan were alive, how sad he would be to learn of all this. Everyone on the streets and alleys has a worried expression. If you ask them why, their answer is that it is too much to put into words.</p>
<p>The suspicious surrounding conversations are not entirely in the Nantong dialect, but mostly in the accents of other counties. After the victory, the harsh policies of the Communist area have caused the population here to increase sharply, with the number of outsiders almost equal to the number of locals. Therefore, most of the people I met were from my county. They did not come because of the name or for sightseeing; they were forced to flee. The cost of living in Nantong is not necessarily low, and oil, salt, firewood, and rice are not necessarily cheap, but they feel that this is a land of peace and happiness where they can breathe freely and speak casually without restraint. It is much better than a place where you can't even get a sip of thin congee, have no thatched hut to live in, and your thoughts are controlled and your actions are monitored. Their only request is to be able to survive, but even this most basic requirement cannot be met in their area. What crime have these ordinary people committed?</p>
<p>Land Distribution - One Mu and Three Fen Per Person</p>
<p>According to someone who came from dozens of miles away from Tongzhou, the result of land distribution in the Communist area is that each person only received one mu and three fen of land. Including the homestead, some families with large homesteads only received a homestead. How can you plant on a homestead, how can you produce, and how can you live? People like this can only wait to starve to death. In reality, if calculated on a township basis, each person should receive more than two mu, but only one mu and three fen of land were distributed to each person. Where did the rest go, and what is it being kept for? Ordinary people cannot ask these questions. If you ask, the authorities will suspect you and may even face mortal danger. The Communist army's solution to people's livelihood is to solve the livelihood of a few people (it can be said that it is the livelihood of extremely few people). The Communist army's equal distribution of land is to distribute the land equally to themselves. The intention is only to allow a few people to survive, to allow the people who join the work to survive, and to allow the people who believe in the Communist Party to survive. In the end, even the people who join the work cannot survive and will be squeezed out. Only the people who believe in the Communist Party can survive. The result is to turn the world red and impose a one-party dictatorship.</p>
<p>Terror - Killing at Will</p>
<p>Under the dictatorial and terroristic policies, the people in the so-called liberated areas have no choice but to leave their homes and flee. The local authorities must not know that people have escaped. If they find out, they will be regarded as "wavering elements," a very serious charge. Therefore, people who come out escape secretly without saying a word. Sometimes, even their family members do not know where they have fled to. There are only three types of people who escape: people with prestige, people with assets, and people with knowledge. These three types of people are thorns in the side of the Communist army, and they will not hesitate to use any vicious means to remove them. People with prestige are called "stubborn factions" who are cunning and treacherous if they are not used by the Communist army. People with assets are considered "enjoyers of life" who do not think about production. People with knowledge are called "obstructors of work" if they do not believe in the Communist army's propositions. The most ridiculous thing is that even people who have always been indifferent to the world and taciturn are given an inexplicable title of "suspicious elements." In short, people who are neutral, people who do not associate with them, and people who do not join the Communist army's front are all regarded as uncivilized people and are not allowed to exist. When absolutely necessary, if the above three types of people show a little bit of expression, they will be killed with a trumped-up charge. In a certain township, there was an old township head who had served as township head when the New Fourth Army first arrived in northern Jiangsu. At that time, he was praised as a capable township head. A few dozen days ago, he talked a little about the situation of the National Army in a store. A militia captain found out and took him to a wilderness area and executed him in the name of "reactionary." Even Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars was not so cruel. How should the freedom of speech and personal guarantees touted by the Communist Party's newspapers day and night be explained? Are there regional restrictions and do they not apply to the so-called liberated areas of the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Hope - The National Army Arrives</p>
<p>None of the people who have fled to Nantong do not hope that the National Army will arrive soon. Sometimes, although they feel that the government's administration is not entirely satisfactory and that the discipline of the National Army is inevitably disappointing, they believe that this phenomenon is temporary and accidental. From comparison, they deeply feel that the government's administration is much better than the Communist army's tyranny. Their criticism of the Communist army is that they are like beasts and inhumane. Their understanding of the Communist army is that they use clever words to deceive and high-pressure tactics of terror. They do not understand democratic rhetoric. They distinguish right from wrong and who can be approached and who cannot be approached from their practical experience. Their only hope now is that a large number of National Army troops will arrive as soon as possible and thoroughly eliminate the Communist army. As long as they can go home one day, even a sip of weak congee and a thatched hut will be enough. (Seen)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Creates Ministry of Defence - Unifies Jurisdiction over Army, Navy and Air Force - Alexander Appointed Minister, Cabinet Reduced to Thirteen Members</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The British government issued a public statement today announcing the creation of a Ministry of Defence to coordinate the work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in England. The public statement, entitled "Central Organisation for Defence," announced several changes to the British defence structure, but also stated that this reform is a natural development of the past forty years of policy. The Prime Minister remains the principal person responsible for defence, and will serve as chairman of the Defence Committee. The Minister of Defence, Lord President of the Council, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the three service ministers, Minister of Labour, and Minister of Supply will all be ex-officio members of the committee. The creation of the Ministry of Defence is intended to reduce the cabinet from twenty to eighteen members, and to lower the status of the three service ministers. However, while they will no longer be in the Cabinet, they will remain ministers. The Minister of Defence will be responsible for allocating available resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force in accordance with the general policies set by the Defence Committee, and for establishing general policies regarding military research and development. The Minister of Defence will also be responsible for general administrative issues. The three service departments will establish common policies on general administration. The ministers of the three services have resigned, which has been approved by the government. These are Secretary of State for War Lawson, Secretary of State for Air Lord Stansgate, and Minister of Civil Aviation Lord Winster.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Alexander was appointed British Minister of Defence tonight. Mr. Alexander has been First Lord of the Admiralty since 1940, and will now have jurisdiction over the Army, Navy, and Air Force. However, since the Ministry of Defence has not yet been fully organised, Mr. Alexander will temporarily be Minister without Portfolio.</p>
<p>The British cabinet has been reorganised as a result of the establishment of the Ministry of Defence. Former Colonial Secretary Hall succeeds Alexander as First Lord of the Admiralty, former Secretary of State for Defence Noel-Baker succeeds Lord Stansgate as Secretary of State for Air, former Under-Secretary of State for War Bellenger succeeds Lawson as Secretary of State for War, and Lord Nathan succeeds Winster as Minister of Civil Aviation. Lord Winster has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus tonight. Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies Creech Jones has been promoted to Colonial Secretary. Foreign Secretary Bevin's deputy, McNeil, has been promoted to Minister of State. Although Lord Stansgate will leave the government, he will temporarily remain Bevin's representative in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Young Talent</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th]. Political observers here say that there are two motives for this British cabinet reshuffle: one is to form an independent Ministry of Defence, and the other is to recruit younger people into the cabinet. The establishment of the Ministry of Defence is the result of recent meetings between British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery and US Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower. Recent meetings have also decided to maintain the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Chiefs of Staff. Regarding the recruitment of younger talents, the promotion of McNeil (the former Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, newly appointed Minister of State) is one example. Foreign Secretary Bevin values him greatly and almost regards him as his successor. At the same time, many of the newly appointed undersecretaries are young talents.</p>
<p>The British cabinet's implementation of this reorganisation is the result of Marshal Montgomery, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, going to the United States for consultations not long ago. (Picture shown) Marshal Montgomery (right) visits the United States and meets with President Truman (left). The photo was taken at the White House. (US News Bureau)</p>

<h3>US and Soviet Representatives at the Peace Conference Appeal for World Peace - All Committees Have Finished Their Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 5th, Broadcast: All committees of the peace conference have finished their work and are preparing to submit the draft peace treaties to the general assembly for final decision.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 5th, Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and US Representative Connally both expressed their desire to maintain world peace today. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union fully supports Stalin's recent speech on world peace. Although the views of various countries are not consistent, we advocate world cooperation. Connally also loudly appealed at the meeting of the Italian Political Committee, saying, "We must not have another war. Some people think that war may be possible now, but I do not believe that humanity has lost its senses to the point of making people shed blood again."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] The Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, Mr. Dubail, recently met with the chairmen of various committees to discuss how to accelerate the work of the committees, especially the work of the Economic Committee on Italy, which is far from its planned schedule.</p>

<h3>UK Holds United Nations Week - Ambassador Cheng Delivers Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 5th] Chinese Ambassador to the UK Dr. Cheng Tianxi delivered a broadcast speech for United Nations Week on the British Broadcasting Corporation today, calling on all countries in the world to unite for peace. Dr. Cheng said that the Chinese are known throughout the world for their peace-loving nature. Ancient Chinese philosophers taught the principles of kindness and justice and cultivated them as the foundation of peace. Dr. Cheng continued, "Our international relations are based on these principles, so that all countries in the world can sincerely cooperate to achieve the goal of peace and the happy life of mankind. In the Second World War, China resisted for more than eight years and suffered the most and sacrificed the most. Therefore, we desire to maintain peace and do everything we can to make the United Nations successful. The principles of the United Nations are in line with the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China. President Chiang Kai-shek continued the legacy of Premier Sun and, as the leader of the Chinese people, joined forces with the United Nations to resist tyranny in order to establish a truly great republican country. Now that the war is over, the task of guaranteeing world peace falls on the shoulders of the United Nations, but its organization is still in its infancy. Unless we explain its purpose and its huge responsibilities to the people of the world and make them cooperate, it will not be easy to achieve the goal. This is what United Nations Week is for. I am very honored to have the opportunity to explain China's heartfelt support for this United Nations Week and our gratitude to all participating countries."</p>
<h3>Churchill Delivers Speech, Urges National Unity to Resist Communism, Will Not Relinquish Duty While Breath Remains</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 5th (Broadcast): Churchill, in a speech at the Conservative Party National Convention on Saturday, contrasted the shrinking British Empire with the expanding Soviet Union. He pleaded that the severity of the situation prevented him from retiring from public life. He also criticized the Labor government's "vacillation and lack of planning" regarding the Palestine issue. He stated that misfortune and bloodshed might occur in India, which would be lost, and Burma would soon face the same fate. Churchill added that the total number of subjects of the British Empire had gradually decreased to less than one-quarter of its former size, while the people under Soviet autocratic rule were increasing daily. Churchill continued, "I have long considered retirement, but the general situation is so serious that I cannot relinquish my duty. As long as I have breath, I will continue to fight and serve the country."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Black Sea, 5th] Churchill spoke at the Conservative Party Convention here today, stating, in brief, that we, like a large number of neighboring countries, do not wish to have a fundamental discussion of the Party's constitution. The government and its opposition parties—the Socialist Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Party—are now united in resisting communism and the Communist Party. The Socialist Party's declared opposition to communism, while not significant domestically, has generated considerable influence abroad. There is substantial agreement among the parties on the main principles of foreign policy. Close cooperation between Britain and the United States is particularly genuine, and America's firm and unwavering policy in Europe and its abandonment of isolationism are the main bulwarks for safeguarding peace.</p>
<h3>US to Assist Jewish Homeland, Truman Issues New Statement on Palestine, Bluntly Rejects Placing Jewish and Arab Areas Under British Rule</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] President Truman has sent a letter to British Prime Minister Attlee, stating that the Palestine issue must be resolved immediately and need not wait for the Palestine Round Table Conference to reconvene on December 16. The US government is willing to provide all necessary assistance to send exiled Jews to Palestine. This matter must be resolved this winter. I have always advocated transferring 100,000 Jews to Palestine, and this should begin immediately, even before a complete resolution of the Palestine issue is reached. I am willing to submit a plan to Congress for economic aid to Palestine. Furthermore, I also support the Zionist movement's plan to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman's statement has created a clear divergence in the positions of Britain and the United States on the Palestine issue. The differences of opinion with Britain include the following points: First, Britain insists that it is unwilling to allow a large number of Jews to immigrate to Palestine without some form of agreement from the Arabs, to avoid inciting incidents. Truman completely rejects this. Second, Britain insists that Palestine be divided into Jewish and Arab areas under British rule, which Truman bluntly refuses, stating that all major American political parties oppose this plan. Third, Truman strongly supports the partition plan for Palestine proposed by the Jewish Agency and has suggested its adoption to British Prime Minister Attlee. Britain has apparently made no progress on this. The substance of the Jewish Agency's proposal is to allow the Jews to establish an independent state in a considerable area of Palestine, and Britain should immediately issue passports to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. According to President Truman, he does not believe that the plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab areas differs greatly from the Jewish Agency's proposal. The US government is willing to offer assistance in resolving the issue.</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Regret, Reactions from All Sides</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] President Truman's appeal to Britain, published today, calling for a large number of Jewish immigrants to be allowed into Palestine before the entire Palestine issue is resolved, has prompted the British Foreign Office to state tonight: British authorities express regret over this. The President's appeal may harm the complicated negotiations currently underway. The President's decision to announce this document today contradicts the wishes expressed by British Prime Minister Attlee. Last night, the US Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Mr. Gallman, called on the Prime Minister and presented him with the President's statement. The Prime Minister requested that its publication be delayed until he could discuss it with Foreign Secretary Bevin, who is currently in Paris and unable to address the matter. Unexpectedly, the President did not heed this request and proceeded with the announcement. Even the Jewish community in London does not warmly welcome this document. One experienced Jewish observer said that the publication of this document is intended to attract votes in the November congressional elections, and the Democratic Party may increase its vote share as a result, but it will not change British policy.</p>
<h3>Arabs Also Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] According to an Arab politician, if President Truman wants to implement his proposal to allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine "immediately in large numbers," it will undermine peace. Syrian Member of Parliament Kouri also stated that Britain has promised that no Jews will be allowed to enter Palestine during the recess of the Palestine Round Table Conference. All Arabs will oppose Truman's statement with all their might. If Truman wants the Arabs to accept his proposal, he will have to send 500,000 US troops to enforce it, which I believe Mr. Truman has not considered. Prime Minister Attlee himself has not yet issued a statement. When Truman's telegram arrived in London, Jewish leaders here were attending a service in the synagogue. Officials at the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office stated that Truman's statement is significant and should be submitted to the Cabinet for discussion, and it is not appropriate to comment lightly at this time.</p>
<h3>British Memorandum Submitted to Turkey, Explaining Views on the Straits Issue, US Considering Whether to Take New Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated this morning that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir David Kelly, yesterday submitted a memorandum to the Turkish government explaining Britain's views on the Soviet note to Ankara proposing amendments to the current status of the Black Sea Straits. While the official did not disclose the contents of the memorandum, he denied reports that Britain was urging the Turkish government to resolutely reject the recent Soviet proposals. Well-informed sources here believe that the memorandum contains the following key points: (1) Britain does not agree with the Soviet proposal that the Dardanelles Straits should be controlled by countries bordering the Black Sea and jointly defended by the Soviet Union and Turkey. (2) While Britain agrees to revise the Montreux Convention of 1936 governing the status of the Dardanelles Straits, it believes that this should be accomplished through an international conference. (3) Britain is willing for any relevant parties to hold direct discussions before such a conference is convened, but believes that actual negotiations should be conducted by the conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States is actively considering whether to take new action regarding the Soviet demand to jointly manage the Dardanelles Straits with Turkey. The State Department will submit various decisions to President Truman for instructions, allowing the President to decide whether to send notes to the Soviet Union and Turkey.</p>
<h3>Turkey Denies Alliance with Syria</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 4th] The Turkish News Agency was instructed to deny reports in certain foreign newspapers and radio stations that the Turkish government will negotiate a military alliance or mutual assistance agreement with the Syrian government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops to Permanently Station in Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Special Dispatch] According to a report by Reynolds, the Washington correspondent for the Chicago Sun, the Soviet Union has decided to permanently station troops in northern Korea, or to remain until Korea can establish a communist puppet government that is completely favorable to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Hull Collapses Again, Condition Hopeless</h3>

<p>Munich Authorities Deny This Claim</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 5th (Emergency Broadcast from Munich): Qualified authorities have just announced that the rumor that Hitler's assistant, Bormann, was arrested in Munich today is pure fabrication. According to previous reports, Martin Bormann was killed by artillery fire when Berlin fell, but his survival has not been fully confirmed and remains a mystery.</p>
<h3>Authorities in French Occupation Zone Refuse Entry to Papen, etc.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 5th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Dr. Steer, the Nuremberg German Police Chief, has informed Schacht and Fritsche that they have been granted freedom and can go anywhere, but only within the Nuremberg city limits.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Authorities in the British and French occupation zones of Germany have refused to allow Schacht and Fritsche to enter their zones, and the French occupation zone does not allow Papen to enter. According to US authorities, these individuals will be given the opportunity to choose the location they wish to go to. If they choose the Soviet occupation zone, appropriate authorities will be asked for permission. If the military government provides transportation for departure, a safe conduct pass will be issued to them for travel to the chosen location, and the German police will be notified to provide appropriate protection to prevent mob violence against them. The future handling of Schacht, Fritsche, and Papen under German law will be decided by the German authorities.</p>
<h3>Nehru and Jinnah Meet, Hope for Cooperation Between Congress and League</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 5th] Indian Interim Government Chairman Nehru and League Chairman Jinnah have accepted the invitation of the President of the Princes' Conference, Nawab, to dine together at Nawab's residence in New Delhi today. This is the first meeting between the two men in seven weeks. Observers in New Delhi now believe that Nawab's efforts may result in the formation of a coalition government between the Congress Party and the League.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 5th, According to Dr. Seidl, lawyer for Hess and Frank] Pope Pius XII, through Cardinal Faulhaber of Munich, requested the Allied Control Council in Berlin to pardon Frank, who had been sentenced to death by hanging for his crimes as Governor of Poland. Frank converted to Catholicism after being arrested. Göring filed an appeal with the Control Council minutes before the deadline. To date, a total of eleven German war criminals sentenced to death have filed appeals: Göring, Rosenberg, Bormann, Streicher, Frank, Frick, Jaga, Funk, Jodl, and those sentenced to life imprisonment, Hess and Dönitz. All appeals will be reviewed by the Allied Control Council within a week.</p>

<h3>International Monetary Fund's Mission: Stabilize Currency, Prevent Trade Wars; US Treasury Secretary Urges Quick Loan Restorations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The International Monetary Fund (IMF), known as the center of the United Nations' movement to encourage the world to abandon economic weapons, is not as conservative as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and is considered an innovation in stabilizing national currencies. Gutt, the world-renowned Belgian financier, will be responsible for guiding the work of the IMF. He is quoted as saying that he believes the IMF can stabilize the volatile currencies of various countries, but it will take many years of effort to succeed. The IMF has $8.8 billion in funds, which can prevent countries from resorting to old tricks and creating trade wars like those of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Countries participating in the IMF are, in effect, voluntarily disarming economically, agreeing to cede part of their economic sovereignty to the IMF in exchange for the fund's protection and assistance. The IMF currently has 39 member states, and at least four more are planning to join. The only major country that has not joined is the Soviet Union. The United States has invested $2.75 billion, more than any other country, followed by the United Kingdom with $1.3 billion. The initial task of the IMF is to determine the par value of each country's currency. A portion of the currencies will be fixed within 90 days of the country's initial notification, but countries occupied by enemy countries during the war have the right to request an extension. Once a country's currency is fixed, it must consult with the IMF before making any changes, but changes of up to 10% above or below its value do not require approval from the fund. Member states that do not comply with the resolutions can be expelled. The second step of the IMF's work will begin after the currency ratios of various countries have been determined. Thereafter, the IMF will provide temporary foreign exchange to countries in need of foreign exchange for trade.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The first annual meeting of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund concluded today. Outgoing Chairman Snyder (US Secretary of the Treasury) read a letter from UN Secretary-General Lie, urging that restoration loans be provided to member states as soon as possible, saying that without these loans, production in countries ravaged by war cannot be increased and many years of relief will be required.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tragedy in a World of Color, Carnage at the New Guang Theater, Thugs Hurl Hand Grenade, Explosion Fells Twelve on the Spot, Two Seriously Wounded, Lives in Danger</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At approximately 8:00 PM last night, during the showing of the musical film "A World of Color" at the New Guang Theater, before the third showing had ended, thugs suddenly hurled a wooden-handled military hand grenade at the ticket booth on the right side. The grenade exploded on the spot, injuring as many as twelve employees, patrons, and passersby, in what is the most unprecedented tragedy in Shanghai since the victory.</p>
<p>The origin of the military hand grenade is peculiar. According to an investigation by reporters at the scene, the thugs who threw the grenade must have stood in front of the stone steps outside the theater and hurled the grenade into the corridor inside the theater. At that time, the patrons who were buying tickets and waiting in front of the ticket booth suddenly heard a "flying grenade." A deafening explosion erupted, and cries of pain filled the air. The order inside the theater was thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>The theater began showing the musical film "A World of Color," starring John Carroll and Susan Hayward, the day before yesterday. Business was booming, and to accommodate the crowds, the number of showings was increased to four per day. Last night, during the third showing at 7:00 PM, as it was dinner time, all but the inspector Li Qinxuan went upstairs to eat. Unexpectedly, at that moment, thugs in front of the stone steps at the entrance hurled a hand grenade at the ticket booth on the right side. The grenade landed next to the stone steps in front of the ticket booth and exploded instantly. In addition to Li Qinxuan being injured on the spot, twelve others were wounded by shrapnel, including Tang Yigao, who sold programs for the theater, and patrons Xie Genrong, Chen Zhilong, Jin Yuquan, Wang Xigui, Mr. Cai, Yue Junkang, and passersby Zhu Fuxing, Yue Shunhua, Yue Jinhua, and Ding Jinhong. The thugs took advantage of the confusion to escape without a trace. After the incident, the theater immediately stopped the showing and urgently called the military, police, and constabulary authorities and the fire department to dispatch ambulances to the scene to rush the injured to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Among them, Xie Genrong and Tang Yigao were seriously injured, and their lives are in danger. Director Shi of the Lao Zha Police Station took photographs of the scene as evidence and launched a strict investigation to apprehend the culprits. It was found that the grenade had extremely strong destructive power. In addition to two marble steps being destroyed, almost all of the glass in the doors was shattered, and the ceiling was riddled with shrapnel.</p>

The inaugural meeting was held at the Central Bank Club yesterday at 4 PM.</p>
<p>Assisting the Great Task of National Reconstruction</p>
<p>Chairman Kong Yongzhi delivered the opening address. He stated that during the Anti-Japanese War, while in New York, he attended the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association and discussed Sino-American economic cooperation with key industrialists and businessmen. At that time, he promised to establish a China General Chamber of Commerce to facilitate practical cooperation. After returning to China, he invited comrades to engage in preparations, always mindful of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and the vital importance of realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regards the inevitable victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the inevitable success of national reconstruction as the common goal of the nation. He hopes that comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors will strive to assist in the great task of ensuring the success of national reconstruction. Subsequently, preparation committee members Fu Rulin and Shou Jingwei reported on the progress of the preparations. City government representative Wu Kaixian and city party headquarters representative Wang Xianqing delivered speeches. Following this, Wu Yunchu and Wang Xiaolai offered congratulatory remarks. After passing the articles of association, directors and supervisors were elected. Kong Yongzhi was elected Chairman of the Board, and Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi were elected Vice-Chairmen. There were twenty-eight directors: Chen Guangfu, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Dihua, Bei Zuyi, Fu Bo, Shou Jingwei, Wu Yunchu, Luo Qinghua, Song Ziliang, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Guomao, Yang Guanbei, Yu Zuoting, Zhu Huiqing, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Guangchi, Dai Zhi, Wu Rencang, Wang Zhixing, Li Tongcun, Zhang Yujiu, Ge Jechen, Wang Xianqing, Wang Zulin, and Ge Jingzhong. There were nine alternate directors: Li Wenjie, Li Daonan, Cai Xintang, Tang Jishan, Gu Gengchu, Qu Wenqiao, Liu Jingji, Pan Shihao, and Pan Shijie. There were eleven supervisors: Song Hanzhang, Pan Gongzhan, Li Fusun, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Fan Zhengbo, Jin Runxiang, Lu Zuofu, Xi Yushu, Lu Cangyan, and Duanmu Kai. There were four alternate supervisors: Lian Yingzhou, Wei Zengfu, Zhang Wenkui, and Zhou Maobai.</p>
<p>Restoring Vitality and Connecting Economies</p>
<p>Finally, the following declaration was passed: "Now that the Second World War has ended for over a year, our nation's various construction projects should be comprehensively planned and actively launched. In particular, the establishment of the most modern type of industry and commerce should be the primary task. The implementation of industrialization in our country is a determined national policy, and post-war commercial policies worldwide will also undergo epoch-making innovations. We, assessing the situation, should catch up quickly and prepare ourselves. This is the natural trend of national economic development at the beginning of national reconstruction, and it is also the natural trend of industrial and commercial advancement. As for how to implement post-war industrial and commercial construction, it is necessary to treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and to consider both domestic and international aspects. Based on the current economic ills, we must prescribe the right medicine. The primary goal is to rescue the unprecedented crisis in the national economic sphere and quickly restore the vitality of industry and commerce. Secondly, we must strive to promote communication between domestic industry and commerce and the overseas Chinese economy. Furthermore, we aim to establish the position of national industry and commerce to engage with international trade and international finance circles, and to lay the foundation for international economic cooperation. In this process, it is especially necessary to gather entrepreneurs, financiers, economists, technicians, and other wise individuals from home and abroad to express their views and discuss sincerely. Issues such as how to balance national defense and the people's livelihood, how to divide labor and cooperate between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, how to coordinate and utilize free and cooperative economies, how to maintain and develop domestic and foreign trade, and how to comprehensively promote personnel training, scientific management, and financial regulation should all be addressed to rectify current shortcomings and reorganize them. This will enable national capital to coordinate with international capital and utilize it effectively. This is not merely about seeking the restoration of pre-war industry and commerce. Recognizing this, we have specially invited comrades from all relevant parties to initiate the organization of the 'China General Chamber of Commerce' to pool wisdom and encourage each other. We aim to be a design organization for domestic industrial and commercial groups and entrepreneurs, as well as a central hub for connecting overseas Chinese and international economic groups. We hope that domestic and overseas industrial and commercial groups and economic experts will actively participate and provide guidance, so that we can pool wisdom and effort, facilitate trade and benefit industry. This is not only the fortune of our colleagues, but also the fortune of the future of our nation's industry and commerce."</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday: Preparatory Meeting in the City to Discuss Celebration Methods</h3>
<p>Various groups in the city, in order to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, held the first preparatory meeting for celebrating the Chairman's sixtieth birthday at the City Council at 3 PM the day before yesterday. The attendees included Pan Gongzhan from the City Council, Fang Rusheng from the Federation of Labor Unions, Li Zai from the Bankers' Association, Zhu Jiushen from the Old Industry Association, Xu Jiguang from the Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Jizhou and Yu Chuanding from the Education Association, Feng Youzhen from the Journalists' Association, Li Zikuan from the Newspaper Publishers' Association, Pang Jingzhou from the Medical Association, Xu Yongzuo from the Accountants' Association, Wu Zheng from the Lawyers' Association, and Zhu Wende from the Local Association, totaling thirteen people. Those present in an advisory capacity included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xi Wenzhong, executive member of the City Party Headquarters. Chairman Pan Gongzhan stated: The City Council proposed that the city should hold a celebration for the Chairman's sixtieth birthday this year, and should also establish a permanent memorial to show respect and gratitude. The proposed celebration methods include: (1) donating a school as a birthday gift, (2) building a Zhongzheng Hall, (3) casting a bronze statue, and (4) establishing a scholarship fund. He hoped that everyone would discuss these options together. As a result, it was decided that, in order to express the unanimous desire of the city's people to celebrate enthusiastically, the first organizers would invite hundreds of groups, including business associations, labor unions, religious organizations, hometown associations, student federations, women's associations, and postal service associations, to participate. The second general meeting of organizers was scheduled for 2 PM on the 12th of this month at the Chamber of Commerce. At that meeting, preparatory committee members would be nominated, a committee would be formed, and preliminary discussions on celebration methods would be held. The consensus was to simplify the celebrations, focusing only on donating a school and creating a statue as birthday gifts, both of which could serve as permanent memorials. It was proposed that the birthday celebration hall be located at the Ningbo Hometown Association. The organization of the preparatory committee would be divided into general affairs, finance, design, layout, and storage groups. The above discussion results were proposed to be passed by the second organizers' meeting before a final decision is made.</p>
<h3>If Neon Lights are Used Again from Tomorrow, Electricity Will Be Cut Off: Three Steps Implemented to Increase Power Production</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Regarding the temporary suspension of the use of neon lights and decorative lights, the Public Utilities Bureau is currently adopting a peaceful guidance approach, hoping that all merchants and residents of the city will understand the difficulties and comply. However, according to Director Zhao Huijue of the Public Utilities Bureau, if anyone continues to disobey after the 7th of this month, electricity will be cut off.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau, in order to solve Shanghai's power shortage and increase production to fulfill national policies, the Public Utilities Bureau has designated increasing power supply as one of the central tasks for the coming year. Based on three major steps, it will be actively completed: (1) supervising various power plants to repair machinery damaged during the war, (2) supervising various power plants to add new machinery, and (3) assisting various power plants in applying for loans and purchasing generators. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau assisted the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in borrowing 2.4 billion yuan from the Four Banks Joint Office for repairing two damaged Squad machines. However, it will take more than a year to complete the repair of these two machines. Rumors that Zhabei Water and Electricity will be able to generate 30,000 kilowatts this year are not accurate. A new diesel machine purchased by the French Water and Electricity Company, with a capacity of 3,600 kilowatts, will arrive by the end of the year. Another one will arrive in June next year.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai's monthly power generation is 141,000 kilowatts. If all work can be implemented according to the planned schedule, power generation will increase by one-third by the end of next year. It is estimated that it will reach 180,000 kilowatts by the end of March, 188,640 kilowatts by the end of June, 192,640 kilowatts by the end of September, and 217,640 kilowatts by the end of December.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the "Shanghai Power Grid Technical Committee," organized by the Public Utilities Bureau together with relevant experts, plans to complete the entire Shanghai power grid in the first half of next year, facilitating the realization of a 33,000 kilowatt ring-shaped power supply. At the same time, it will rationalize, standardize, and unify the generation, transmission, distribution, and use of electricity in all power plants in the city.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Cosmetics Industry Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association has specially dispatched representatives Hu Boxiang (Director), Lin Rukang (Director), Ma Lingyun, Zhou Feng'ai, and Fu Keming to Nanjing to petition the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant agencies, requesting the authorities to postpone the recently promulgated and implemented cosmetics commodity tax, which levies 45% based on price, in order to save the crisis facing the entire industry. According to the representatives: (1) The current cosmetics industry is small and underdeveloped, with most production being manual. Only a few have simple mechanical equipment, and they are not suitable targets for collecting commodity tax. (2) A large number of imported cosmetics are flooding in, mostly goods that evade taxes, resulting in extremely low costs. Domestically produced cosmetics can hardly compete. If a commodity tax of 45% is added, they will have no place to stand. (3) The term "cosmetics" is too vague. Items such as talcum powder, soap, cologne, skin cream, and face lotion are daily hygiene products used in summer or winter and should not be treated as cosmetics.</p>
<h3>A Group of Polish Nationals Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] A group of Polish nationals departed on the Soviet ship Smolny for Vladivostok, then transferred to the Trans-Siberian Railway to return home. Among them were two doctors and five sailors who had been stranded in Shanghai during the war and were detained in concentration camps by the Japanese army. During this long journey, UNRRA not only paid for all their travel expenses but also provided winter clothing, bedding, and food rations. The most right in the column are Mr. Kerber, director of the Displaced Persons Repatriation Group of the UNRRA Shanghai Office, and his assistant, Mr. Kerff. (Photo by The New York Times)</p>
<h3>Bright, Dazzling, Hard: Diamonds Valued Thousands of Times Over, the Best Have "Fifty-Eight Facets," Costing 2.67 Million Yuan per Carat</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] I am merely a piece of ore. In terms of the chemical elements discovered, I am a form of carbon. To date, relatively few of my kind have been unearthed. Scarcity makes me valuable, so I am regarded as a "treasure." Furthermore, my quality is the hardest, so the Chinese compatriots have given me the honorable title of "Diamond."</p>
<p>The visual impression I give is brightness, purity, honesty, and dazzling radiance. However, unfortunately, some of my famous colleagues have had their tragedies and histories after being discovered and polished by humans. The Habsburg dynasty of Austria, the Russian Tsar, the French royal family of Pitt, the Persian Mongol emperor Immot... which prominent dynasty did not have a close relationship with me! The most famous of my colleagues is currently set in the crown of the British monarch!</p>
<p>Most of my colleagues come from Kimberley in South Africa and Brazil in South America. In just a few hundred years, I have become the only treasure circulating internationally!</p>
<p>Shanghai—an international metropolis—how could it be without me? However, my contact with the people of Shanghai has only been about forty or fifty years. My popularity in the market is only a matter of the last twelve or thirteen years.</p>
<p>Currently, it is difficult to categorize my colleagues circulating in the market. However, in terms of color, we can roughly divide them into five types: white, yellow, red, blue, and black. Comparatively, the white ones with a hint of red are of course the most precious. The people of Shanghai have given them the nickname "kerosene head." Unfortunately, these "kerosene head diamonds" are extremely rare. The ones commonly seen circulating are white without a hint of red, which are commonly referred to as "white diamonds"!</p>
<p>Let me tell you, a well-cut standard diamond has "fifty-eight facets," that is, fifty-eight small faces. Please carefully examine the waist of a diamond, and you can see that it is divided into the crown and the pavilion. The most beautiful small facet on the crown is called the "table." The small faces surrounding it are eight called "stars," four called "bevels," four called "rhomboid faces," eight called "cross faces," and eight called "skill faces." These thirty-three small faces on the surface of a diamond are distributed at different angles, emitting light. Furthermore, the small facets of the pavilion are mostly fewer than those of the crown, with only twenty-five small faces. Their names are: "culet" (opposite the "table" of the crown), four "girdle facets," four "wedge facets," eight "cross faces," and eight "skill faces." It is said that now, with the increasing progress of polishing machines, the best can be cut to sixty-four facets.</p>
<p>The August 13th artillery fire was a major turning point in my life history in Shanghai. Because, from then on, I saw endless banknotes rolling in, and my "value" increased daily. Taking the kerosene head diamond as an example, in 1936 and 1937, it was 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per carat. Now it is 2.67 million yuan! Furthermore, taking the slightly inferior white diamond as an example, the current market price also hovers between 1.6 million and 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>However, the market price of diamonds must also be determined by its weight. For example, taking white diamonds as an example, within fifty points (half a carat), each carat is calculated at a ratio of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. For those around twenty points, each carat is calculated at a ratio of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. However, for small diamonds within ten points, the market price is even calculated at a ratio of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per carat. These are all calculated based on the difficulty of polishing and the breadth of circulation.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, my "value" has only increased more than 2,000 times in the past nine years, which is considered fair compared to other prices. But to say something bleak, what is circulating and being traded in the market are only diamonds of 0.6 or 0.7 carats to 1.5 carats. To search for a diamond over ten carats, even if you step through all fifty or sixty jewelry stores in the city, the result will still be in vain. It is said that even Shao's collection is only a dozen carats at most. However, one jeweler said: The largest diamonds in Shanghai are about forty carats each, and of course, the number is very small. As for who the collector is, it remains an unbreakable mystery!</p>
<p>However, I must raise the most serious protest to those who only use me as an ornament. Why only treat me as a decorative puppet. I must solemnly declare that I have supreme industrial uses. Look at the precise machinery, the elevators of airplanes, and the shafts of famous watches—which important industrial sector can do without me? For this reason, I want the diamond collectors in the world to give me a new evaluation, so that I can break away from the shackles of exclusive decoration and create more industrial achievements for humanity!</p>
<h3>Financial Circles Implement Austerity, Eliminating Unnecessary Banquets and Receptions: Circular Seeking Opinions Widely from Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Financial leaders in the city, Li Fusun and Qin Runqing, have recently launched an austerity movement in the financial circles. At the same time, Governor Bei Songsun of the Central Bank expressed his great approval. First, Li Ming sent a letter explaining the reasons, listing the names of the initiators, and sending it to colleagues for their opinions in order to draft regulations. Then, they will jointly seek the participation of people in the industry. The original letter from Mr. Li, which our reporter obtained privately, is transcribed below: "Respected Sir: Our country's eight-year war of resistance consumed an enormous amount of manpower and resources. In the future, unless all the people of the country are diligent and thrifty, accumulate resources, and use them for construction, the fruits of victory may be abandoned. Therefore, President Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly urged the people to implement austerity and improve customs. The austerity movement in this city is also being advocated by Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life. I recently discussed this with colleagues in the industry, and we all agreed that Shanghai's extravagant and frivolous customs are now even worse than before. People in the financial industry are outstanding members of the citizens, and they should practice what they preach in the austerity movement to reverse the declining trend. At that time, someone mentioned the frequent banquets and receptions in Shanghai recently. The gentlemen present agreed that most of these banquets and receptions were unnecessary, and that financial figures should first eliminate them in the future. I was instructed to advocate for this. The above proposal is deeply in line with my sentiments. The reasons can be summarized into three points: (1) Unnecessary banquets waste money and time. In today's post-war era, the more we waste, the less construction power the country has. (2) Diligence and frugality are inherent virtues of our country, which are best understood by the conservative financial community. Practicing austerity is in line with the principle of not shirking responsibility. (3) The daily affairs of financial professionals are already busy and complicated. In their spare time, they all want more rest opportunities and more family life time to recover from fatigue easily. All unnecessary social activities directly reduce personal cultivation and indirectly affect the efficiency of governance. During the war of resistance, I traveled far to the United States. The United States is the most affluent country in the world, and its people have the highest standard of living in the world. However, bankers and industrialists in that country do not easily entertain guests. Those who make appointments for meals for business matters usually have simple lunches in order to save time, and they do not invite anyone to accompany them. This situation was not only during the war. Last year, Mr. Zhang Gongquan visited England on official business and informed us of his impressions of England in a letter, saying that after the war, the British were encouraging themselves to be diligent and frugal and were working hard to restore the country. A financial expert invited him to dinner at his home, and he saw that there were no servants in the house and the dishes were simple. The cooking and serving were all done by the hostess. From this point of view, in our poor country, the word "frugality" is more shameful than that of the allies. According to our observation, most people in the financial community have a negative attitude towards unnecessary banquets, but they cannot refuse them altogether. After being invited, they may have to hold banquets in return, so superficially they cannot avoid following the custom, but in reality, everyone has the same thought. For the sake of now, we might as well be honest and avoid redundant practices, jointly declare that all unnecessary banquets should be eliminated, and that gifts for celebrations and so on should also be as frugal as possible. I am sending this special letter to seek your high opinion and to list the names of the initiators below. I respectfully ask for your guidance so that we can formulate regulations and welcome colleagues to participate. I sincerely hope so." Initiators: Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Lin Fengbao, Xu Guangchi, Li Daonan, Shen Rixin, Pan Zhonglin, Xiang Shuxiang, Sun Ruihuang, Xu Guomao, Chen Duoru, Ju Yihong, Cao Jiru, Li Zai, and Li Ming.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhi, Newly Appointed Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, Takes Office Yesterday</h3>

After resting briefly at their residence, they went to the City Party Headquarters to take office and talked with committee members Chen Baohua, Zhou Feicheng, Xu Mingya, and Ge Kexin. It is learned that they will be officially sworn in on the 14th, and important personnel matters in the internal departments will be decided within days.</p>
<h3>Forty Traitors from Suzhou Escorted to Shanghai in Shackles; Zhang Beisheng Shamelessly Claims He "Has Not Forgotten the Country"; Petty Traitors Distribute Leaflets on the Platform</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Beisheng, the traitorous former head of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Pan Hongqi, the traitorous former magistrate of Jiangdu County, and forty other traitors were escorted yesterday by Chen Songnian, the warden of the Suzhou High Court, guard captains Ye Ruiting and Xiang Jian, clerk Yao Qiwen, and ten court police officers. They traveled from Suzhou on a second/third class train to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 1:05 PM. The prisoners, shackled and carrying bags, satchels, and water bottles, disembarked in two rows. Zhang and Pan brought up the rear. Zhang wore a long blue cloth gown and cloth shoes, one heel of which was tattered. As he walked off the platform, he supported his chin with his hand. When reporters approached him, Zhang shamelessly claimed he had not forgotten the country. He was satisfied with the life sentence and would not appeal. Pan wore a coffee-colored gown and a small melon-shaped hat, his beard already white. He said nothing. Some of the petty traitors took out printed materials from their bags titled "A Humble Appeal from 300,000 Helpless Children of the Nation to All Senior Officials," distributing them to the onlookers on the platform. The prisoners were then put onto two waiting buses and taken to Tilanqiao Prison for detention. The complete list of names is as follows: Zhang Beisheng, Pan Hongqi, Shen Zhengxin, Pu Zhaoliang, Gao Zhengang, Ye Jin Erlang, Zhang Jianqiu, Lü Yibiao, Su Xiong, Tang Guilin, Li Suolong, Lu Yisong, Ding Rongxun, Jiang Hong, Ding Yuyi, Kong Lingdu, Liu Gang, Zhou Renbao, Zhu Delin, Dong Jihua, Yang Zhao, Xue Qi, Wu Bingsheng, Wu Zhaoshou, Ji Yangzhang, Luo Zulin, Hu Chunlin, Gao Fuquan, Jiang Juzhen, Zhang Miaogen, Shen Jinkui, Wang Xiyuan, Zhou Caizhang, Pan Menghua, Huo Weishan, Feng Chao, Xie Changgui, Zhi Yangchu, Sui Zhenggao, Qin Haozhong.</p>

They escorted forty convicted traitors by truck to the train station, boarded the 71st second/third class train to Shanghai, and departed around 9 AM to be transferred to Tilanqiao Prison in Shanghai for imprisonment. During the escort, Zhang Beisheng and Pan Hongqi were handcuffed together. Zhang's face was no longer as full of sorrow as before; he was even chatting and laughing, seemingly pleased that he had been spared his life. They spoke loudly at the station, boasting about how they had not failed the people while serving in their traitorous positions, truly shameless. The complete list of names and sentences is recorded below: Zhang Beisheng, life imprisonment. Pan Hongqi, 12 years. Wu Zhaoshou, 7 years. Ji Yangzhang and Luo Zulin, both 6 years.

<h3>Sheng Lao San, Who Rose to Prominence Through Drug Trafficking, Was Known as the Richest Man During the Enemy-Puppet Period; The High Court Summons Two Puppet Officials to Investigate Extortion</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Sheng Youyi (aka Sheng Lao San), who was prominent during the enemy-puppet period and rose to prominence through drug trafficking, and was known as the richest man in Jiangnan, was arrested by military authorities and sent to the Capital High Court for trial after the victory. To obtain a detailed understanding of the case, the court entrusted the local High Court to investigate some of the materials. The High Court opened a hearing yesterday to question Cai **, former head of the Yuyao Puppet Salt Bureau, and Li Yimin, both in custody. Cai stated that Sheng's Yuhua Salt Company had branches in Yuyao that purchased salt at low prices and deducted weight. In 1943, they forced salt farmers to sell salt at a price of twelve yuan per dan (unit) using enemy power. Cai argued that according to the central government's past regulation of ten dan of salt being equivalent to one dan of rice, and with rice priced at six hundred yuan per dan at the time, salt should have been priced at sixty yuan per dan. He insisted on this argument and was forced to resign. Li, who served as the head of the Puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau in Changzhou, Kunshan, and other places, stated that Hongji Shanchang was managed by Sheng as general manager. After opium was transported from North China to Shanghai and concentrated there, it was then transported to various opium dens for sale to smokers. After obtaining licenses from Sheng, the opium merchants could sell opium publicly. With the backing of the enemy's power, the Anti-Smoking Bureau and any government agencies were unable to stop them.</p>
<h3>Former Head of the Puppet Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, Fan Yongzeng, Sentenced to Eight Years</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The High Court yesterday announced verdicts in two cases involving suspected traitors: Fan Yongzeng, for colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist this country, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and eight years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated. The presiding judge explained that the defendant had served as the head of the Puppet Shanghai Land Administration Bureau from the beginning of the war of resistance until the victory, a serious offense. However, because he was initially forced to participate, the sentence was set at eight years. If he disagrees, he can appeal to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment. The defendant repeatedly said, "I will appeal." Fan is a native of Shanghai, currently 57 years old, and studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in engineering. After returning to China, he worked as a professor at Jiaotong University and the River and Sea Engineering College. In 1937, he was still working in the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau as a section chief.</p>
<h3>Chen Zujian Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>Chen Zujian, for colluding with the enemy to supply raw materials for the manufacture of ammunition, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated.</p>
<p>On the same day, the High Court concluded the cases of Shen Sanlang, an intelligence agent for the enemy's Gendarmerie in Nanhui County, and Wang Qiugen, a translator for the Police Unit in Jiading County, and scheduled the verdicts to be announced on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>The cases of Sha Kesiji Baoke, Zhang Shuchun, Yuan Jiaye, Chuan Shaofa, Li Chengde, Xie Guangming, Xu Shutian, and others have been rescheduled for further hearings after investigations are completed.</p>
<p>(Another report) The High Procuratorate has filed charges against Wu Yizhi, Xu Xi, Zhu Linsheng, and others for suspected traitorous activities.</p>
<h3>A Thousand Taels of Opium Seized From the Illegally Obtained Assets of Two Major Traitors</h3>
<p>The Enemy Property Disposal Bureau is handling the illegally obtained assets of detained traitors of all sizes. Those who have already been convicted are being processed. Principles for handling requests from traitors' families for living expenses have also been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review.

<h3>Senator Accused, Prosecutor Unaware</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the accusations against eleven city senators for suspected traitorous activities, this reporter visited Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai High Procuratorate. According to him: "I am not aware of this matter. Accusations of treason are handled separately by each prosecutor. Regardless of whether senators are involved, the investigations cannot be made public according to law. Whether this is the case or not will be proven by the facts in the future." Du also solemnly denied having met with a reporter from Da Guang News Agency on the 4th and made statements. He claimed: "My trip to Nanjing was purely personal. Rumors that it was to request instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding the accusation of treason against city senators are inaccurate. Prosecutors conduct investigations independently and do not need instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration."</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The day before yesterday, Song, the chief of the Taishan Police Station, received a tip that Chen Jiang, a woman from Jiangbei (nicknamed "Wu Zetian"), who lived upstairs at 575 Shunchang Road, had Yuan Ji, the presiding monk of Wanshou Nunnery, as her adopted godfather, and her lover was Chen Jinsheng, a policeman with ID number 4352. She usually relied on the power of her lover to sell morphine and allowed monks Benyi and Liaofan, among others, to smoke drugs in her house. He dispatched Zhang Rou, the director of the judicial section, and Xu Dezhong, among others, to the location. They arrested Chen Jiang, seized 74 packages of morphine, and brought in the drug-addicted monk Benyi, the suspected Yuan Ji, the caretaker monk of Wanshou Nunnery, the customer Ma Jinbiao, and Chen Jiang's lover, Chen Jinsheng, to the police station.

<h3>Answering Readers' Questions; Medical Advisor</h3>
<p>(1) Red Bumps All Over the Body</p>
<p>Yao Zhongming asks: * I often have red bumps rising on all parts of my body. The shape is sometimes long and sometimes oval, with very thin blisters. They itch terribly. Scratching stops the itching but causes severe pain. Is this caused by flea bites or by eating stimulating foods such as shrimp and crab? Are air-filled injections effective? Are there any other simple treatments? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] Your condition is urticaria. You should avoid stimulating foods, take more laxatives to promote bowel movements, and use calcium injections for auxiliary treatment. This will be more effective.</p>
<p>(2) Leg Ulcer</p>
<p>Jiang Hui asks: * My mother has suffered from leg ulcers for more than ten years, and repeated treatments have been ineffective. Sometimes they heal on their own without treatment, but soon they ulcerate again. Recently, the affected area has grown larger, covering almost the entire calf, causing severe pain day and night. Her muscles are wasting away. Because we live in the countryside of Zhuji and are limited by financial resources, we cannot afford hospitalization. Her life is in danger. I don't know if there are any over-the-counter medications that can be purchased. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] For chronic ulcers, a blood test must be performed first, and then treatment can be administered accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) Swollen Tongue with Ulceration</p>
<p>Jin Kehong asks: * When I was young, the surface of my tongue suddenly broke with deep lines. Red spots grew in clusters, and the tip of my tongue had barbs, overflowing with fresh blood. It also had a rotting appearance, without pain or itching. This has been happening for more than ten years, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, with no consistency. Now my tongue is swollen and large, different from ordinary people. My sense of taste is not affected, but speaking and reading are very inconvenient. I cannot speak clearly or pronounce words accurately. I have consulted Chinese and Western doctors, but none of the treatments have been effective. Please advise on treatment methods. I would be grateful for your advice in your column.</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] Your condition may be chronic glossitis, caused by a lack of vitamin B2. Riboflavin injections are recommended.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Brokers Slack Off; Reason Is Demand for Increased Commission; Yarn Market Briefly Halted, Declining by Two to Three Hundred Thousand; Application for Eight Types of Spinfabrics Distribution Not Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>After the yarn market rose with gold yesterday, sales were * and quiet, with few transactions, and a decline of one hundred thousand yuan. At the same time, the * Zhongshe (the brokers' association), the intermediaries in the yarn industry, had a dispute with the yarn industry association over demands for increased commissions. The brokers agreed to temporarily stop soliciting business, so yarn dealers, customers, and practical manufacturers had no transactions due to the lack of intermediaries. It was not until noon that business began to pick up slightly, with prices falling by two to three hundred thousand yuan compared to the previous day. 42-count yarn sold for 3.35 million yuan, and 20-count yarn sold for 2.17 million yuan. It is said that the transactions were between opponents in the industry, and the trend was weak.</p>
<p>In addition, the cotton yarn and cloth market once closed yesterday morning and resumed trading at 11:45 AM. The reasons included not only the brokers' demand for increased commissions, but also the yarn dealers' association's * complaint that Xinguang Underwear Factory and others illegally sold the yarn distributed by Spinfabrics on the black market, with a * profit of 810,000 yuan per bale. Spinfabrics made no clear statement, leading to the market closure. Later, the person in charge of Spinfabrics said: "The distribution of cotton yarn is mainly to processing manufacturers, but Spinfabrics does not want a small number of manufacturers to * ." Therefore, the factories reported are suspended. Other than suspension, there are no other countermeasures. After receiving a notice from the Yarn Dealers Association the other day, reporting that some manufacturers were * selling the distributed yarn, it has already notified those factories on the * list to cancel their distribution rights and has replied to the Yarn Dealers Association. It has been determined to stop distributions later if similar behavior is discovered.</p>
<p>The cloth market also showed little vigor yesterday, with trading becoming more idle and sales stagnating. The transactions were mostly *, and there were sporadic inquiries, so the desire was weak. Spinfabrics * opened for sale eight types of cloth, with 86,000 yuan for Longtou fine cloth. The total amount * was fully distributed. Numbers 1 to 155 and 787 to the end had allocations, totaling 24,000 bolts. Most of the other goods were also allocated, but the number of applicants in this period was not very enthusiastic. The reason is that the * roots have not yet * moved, and the * interest is very high, which is not very cost-effective.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank's Governor Instructs Currency Exchange Businesses Again Yesterday: Strictly Follow the Three Temporary Laws; US Dollar Price Must Not Exceed Telegraphic Transfer Rate by 5%</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] US dollar trading has virtually disappeared since the Currency Exchange Business Association announced a three-day suspension to all its members some days ago. Yesterday, most currency exchange houses still did not open for US dollar transactions. However, along Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, there were still many foreign merchants engaging in small-scale US dollar buying and selling. The black market price was around 4,200 yuan, with a difference of about 100 yuan between buying and selling prices. According to unofficial reports, demand still exceeded supply. Generally, the situation has become stable after the authorities established three temporary measures for various transactions.</p>
<p>This reporter then visited Wang Yuncheng, the chairman of the Currency Exchange Business Association, who said: At 10 a.m. yesterday, he was summoned again by Governor Bei of the Central Bank, and met him again. Mr. Lin, a staff member representing the municipal government, was also present. He stated: He hoped that currency exchange businesses would understand the intentions of the authorities and strictly implement the three temporary measures for buying and selling US dollars that were established some days ago. All buying and selling of US dollars can only be conducted according to the Central Bank's legal exchange rate for US dollars, plus 5% as a standard; otherwise, they would be severely punished. If it is discovered that there are large buyers and those who raise prices to purchase US dollars, it should be reported to the municipal government immediately and must not be concealed. The meeting did not end until noon. Mr. Wang then convened a meeting of the association's directors at around 6 p.m. yesterday to discuss the matter together and resolved to inform all members to strictly implement it. He also said: When US dollar trading resumes on Monday, according to the temporary measures, the market price of US dollars should be 3,517.50 yuan, so the estimated buying and selling price should be between 3,500 yuan and 3,520 yuan, but there are fears that there will be a lack of actual transactions. The market situation may be sluggish for one or two weeks. The difficulty currently felt by currency exchange businesses is the issue of new and old US dollar bills, and they are seeking a reasonable solution to it.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Trading Halted; Gold Price Uncertain and Fluctuating</h3>
<p>The price of gold was uncertain and fluctuating yesterday. It opened at 3 million, and after opening, it once rose as high as 3.21 million. Under the suppression of the Central Bank, it gradually fell. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 30 bars at a price of 3.285 million. After this intervention, the money market tightened. It happened to be Saturday, and there were many liquidations. The price once fell to 3.16 million before it was maintained. There were rumors, and people were agitated. Those with surplus positions mostly absorbed them, and the price once rose to over 3.215 million. At noon, it hovered around 3.195 million. In the afternoon, spot trading was extremely quiet due to Saturday. As a result, it was the same as the previous closing price. The prices of gold ornaments and silver ingots did not change. Silver dollars rose to nearly 2,000 yuan. The unofficial interest rate was tight at first and then even, with interest rates from 1.5 to 1.8.</p>
<p>There were no public foreign exchange transactions, and the black market was very difficult to open. US dollars were initially around 4,100 yuan, and near noon, they rose back to 4,300 yuan. In the afternoon, there was even less activity due to Saturday. As a result, it was similar to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars also lacked public transactions. The market price shrank due to the Central Bank report. The buying price was 840 yuan, and the selling price had to be 870 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan from the previous day. There were very few sellers of Hong Kong exchange, with asking prices around 870 yuan. Indian exchange was 1,040 yuan to 1,060 yuan, and British exchange was 13,800 yuan to 14,000 yuan, all higher than the previous closing prices. There were no US dollar transactions.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Surges; Worth 900 Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] Since the Central Bank ordered the Shanghai US dollar market to suspend public trading for three days, the legal tender in the Hong Kong market plummeted today. Yesterday's closing price was 840 legal tender yuan to one Hong Kong dollar, and today's market price is 905 legal tender yuan to one Hong Kong dollar. US dollar trading in the Hong Kong market is not affected by the Central Bank's order. The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars to US dollars is 4.70 yuan to one dollar, which means that one US dollar in Hong Kong is equivalent to 4,233.50 legal tender yuan. The local market is still stable.</p>
<h3>The Idea Turns to Public Prices Again; Unified C Bonds Jump by 670</h3>
<p>The public bond market continued to be popular. Silk industry banks had maturing pawned goods for sale, but some in the financial community bought them sporadically.

Stockholders then purchased again, and many retail investors pushed up the price, rebounding to a high of 2,600 yuan at the close, resulting in an increase of 670 yuan compared to the previous closing price. A, B, and D bonds also rose by 270 yuan, and Unified E bonds rose by 350 yuan.</p>

<h3>Allotment Work is in Preparation; Artificial Silk Situation Gradually Stabilizing; China Trust Can Allot Eight Times a Month</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market, which had fallen back for several days, gradually stabilized yesterday. 120 Denier Bright Silk, sold at the lowest price of 3.75 million yuan, more than ten thousand yuan less than the previous day. In the afternoon, actual users took advantage of the low price to absorb some, and the price rose back to 3.9 million yuan, similar to the previous day's price. 120 Denier Mixed Brands Bright Silk was ten thousand to fifteen thousand yuan less than Tianqiao Brand. The factories were slightly weak yesterday, and each grade was five thousand to ten thousand yuan short. Silk goods were stable to weak. After the raw materials fell back, buyers were watching, the market was sluggish, and trading was very little. Yesterday, Huajin crepe also sold for a little less than 200 yuan.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the Electrical Industry Association sent out more than ten groups of staff to conduct on-site investigations at various silk factories to find out about the factory's operating conditions and the amount of artificial silk needed. The investigation was completed yesterday. The calculation data will be sent to the Central Trust Bureau today as a standard for the allotment of artificial silk in the coming week. Regarding the allotment method, the China Trust Bureau has consulted with the Textile Construction Company once. China Trust and Textile Construction will allot it jointly. China Trust is responsible for supplying manufacturers, and China Trust entrusts Textile Construction to be responsible for selling to silk merchants. The entrusted sales contract has not yet been finalized by both parties. The China Trust Bureau and the Supply Trust Bureau will allot it eight times a month, twice a week. After the demand of each manufacturer is determined, the full amount can be requested at one time, or two or three times can be requested, which is also acceptable. Assuming that each factory is allotted ten boxes per month, each time two and a half boxes are allotted. If a factory takes four boxes at one time and six boxes at another, they are free to do so. In short, they cannot exceed ten boxes per month in order to allow each factory to plan their business. The China Trust Bureau has now created a registration card for each applying manufacturer, with the power and production volume of each factory and the amount of allotment required, all of which are noted for long-term reference. Due to time constraints, allotment can be carried out first. After investigation, if any discrepancies are found in the report, the allotment qualification will be revoked, and they will not have the right to purchase artificial silk without capital. Regarding the future allotment price of artificial silk, the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau said: It will definitely not exceed the past allotment price of Textile Construction. What is the allotment price? It will be decided temporarily at the time of allotment. If there are no special accidents, allotment can be started next week.</p>
<h3>Bankers Act According to Circumstances; Chinese Stocks Recover from Weakness; Most Trading is Concentrated in Popular Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks rose and fell sharply yesterday, fluctuating and uncertain. When the market opened in the morning, the popular stocks all opened high due to the momentum remaining from the afternoon outside the market the previous day. After opening, they continued to rise sharply. Starting at 10:20, they began to fall back from the high, but there were many struggles along the way. The situation was unfavorable, and they tried their best to support it, hesitating a lot. Extending to 11:00, the situation became more and more weak and tired. Many were panicked and began to plummet below the opening price. Yongxin Cotton broke 800 yuan, and the Meiya 4,400 yuan level could not be maintained. When Yongxin retreated to 790 yuan and Meiya to 4,350 yuan, eager buyers continuously absorbed them, and the market recovered, gradually forming a spin. After 11:20, light gradually appeared. Northern bankers entered Yongxin. Banks chose to buy stocks at low prices. Sichuan bankers vigorously absorbed Xinhua. Although it rose, it spun a lot. At 11:35, it suddenly showed promise. Xinhua Bank entered Meiya. Under the vigorous efforts of the table bankers, Meiya rose to 4,570 yuan, and Yongxin to 830 yuan. Although the small stocks were brought up, they were not very strong. Under the maintenance of the Sichuan bankers, Xinhua rose to 391 yuan. After 11:45, there were many floating positions that profited and closed their positions, and the market spun again. Near noon, the situation was uncertain, but the footing was still firm. As a result, Yongxin, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 0.3%, and Xinhua rose by a strong half percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Zhongfang, Datong, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Underwear, Jinglun, Lianyin, and Huafeng all rose slightly. Zhongsi rose by another half percent, and Xinya and Wuhe fell slightly. The total trading volume was 13.66 million shares. The rises and falls of the various stocks outside the market were very small.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Orders Investigation and Reporting of Unclaimed Flour Warehouse Receipts; Registration of Wheat Transactions for Record</h3>
<p>The market price of flour in this city has been stable for several months. Recently, it has been reported that unscrupulous merchants collude with certain classes to smuggle in large quantities, and the price has soared. Wheat is bought and sold between companies (commonly known as kicking the ball), so the price has also increased sharply. If this kind of collusion and hoarding speculation is not eradicated at the root, it will have a profound and serious impact on the people's food. It is now reported that the Social Bureau has ordered each flour factory in this city to list the quantity, household name, and report of the warehouse receipts for flour that has been sold but not yet picked up by a certain date. Regarding the item of wheat, the Grains, Bean Cake Merchants Association has been strictly ordered to prohibit mutual buying and selling between companies, and those who violate it will be severely punished. The quantity of each month's transaction and the names of the buyers and sellers should be recorded in detail for verification by assigned personnel at any time.</p>
<h3>Screening Tax; Increase the Tax Exemption Point; Guest Meals Not Exceeding 3,000 Yuan; Dim Sum and Cold Drinks Are All Tax-Exempt</h3>

The Bureau believed that the requests of the restaurants and merchants were not without reason, and made appropriate modifications to the tax exemption standards for ordinary restaurants and the price of economic meals, in order to reduce the burden on ordinary people. It is now learned that the tax exemption standards for ordinary restaurants are as follows: All those who meet the following regulations are considered ordinary restaurants and are exempt from the banquet tax: (1) Restaurants, those that only sell porridge, rice with vegetables, and economic meals belong to this category. The above-mentioned economic meal refers to those where dishes cannot be ordered separately and the selling price does not exceed 3,000 yuan per meal. (2) Dim sum shops, those that only sell cooked noodles, wontons, soup dumplings, rice wine, yuanxiao, pastries, pot stickers, dumplings, and other dim sum foods, without ordering other dishes belong to this category. (3) Hotels without kitchen equipment belong to this category. (4) Cold drink shops, those that only sell cold drinks belong to this category. (5) Other situations where there is suspicion, those approved by the Finance Bureau for tax exemption. Furthermore, for restaurants that operate economic meals and banquets, the economic meal portion is allowed to be paid for with meal tickets issued by the Bureau and is exempt from tax.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Trading is Slack; Grains Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>The rice market has been quite firm recently. Although there are many arrivals, the daily business in the North and South markets is sparse. The authorities are paying close attention to it. It is heard that there are often people who privately conclude deals outside. The municipal government has ordered the Social Bureau to strictly crack down on it. Yesterday, the trading in the North and South markets was limited, and the supply and demand were balanced. In the North market, each store did business at the original price. In the South market, passenger yuan plummeted, and passenger goods registration totaled more than 7,000 shi. The purchase of Minyong wheat is still acceptable, and the price is firm. White wheat rose slightly by 300 to 400 yuan. Wheat bran from Zhejiang moved again, rising another 500 to 600 yuan.

<p>Civil Affairs Brief</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Investigation of Publicly Owned Land in Provinces and Cities; Pilot Program to Grant Land to the Families of Soldiers Killed in Action During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The municipal government received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that during the War of Resistance, our brave soldiers gave their lives on the battlefield, sacrificing themselves to the utmost, in glory and heroism, surpassing previous history. Those who are registered in the war death register have been given preferential treatment separately. The distribution and living conditions of their families are difficult to investigate in detail. Considering the difficulties in life and the loss of support for the old and weak, we should find ways to provide relief to show care. It is essential to implement widespread cultivation of publicly owned land in various provinces and cities to ensure that no land is left uncultivated and that land is used to its full potential. The provincial and municipal governments should conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of public land in their respective provinces and cities, select land to pilot the granting of land to the families of soldiers killed in action during the War of Resistance, and ensure that they can cultivate themselves and that the old and weak are taken care of, to supplement the inadequacy of compensation and relief.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Employees' Cooperative; Self-Government Personnel Allowed to Join</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department approved a letter from the Municipal Government Employees' Consumer Cooperative, stating that many district offices and Baojia chiefs, street cleaners, and technicians have applied to join as members. The board of directors has resolved to "allow them to join." They are hereby providing the member registration guidelines and requesting that the various district offices and Baojia chiefs be investigated and verified, and registered in accordance with the procedures, pay the shares, and participate as members.</p>
<h3>Explaining Two Issues: "XX Shi" and "Concubine"</h3>
<p>During the concentrated training of household registration personnel organized by the Civil Affairs Department, when explaining how to fill in the "Name" and "Title" columns of the household registration review, there have been articles discussing the issues of "XX Shi" and "Concubine" in the newspaper. Hereby, the two issues of "XX Shi" and "Concubine" are clarified below:</p>
<p>(1) A name is a symbol of a person. Therefore, the Name Usage Restriction Ordinance promulgated by the National Government stipulates that the real name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one, and the name registered in the household registration is the real name. This household registration review is to apply for household registration on behalf of the people. Filling in the name means that the citizens' legal rights and obligations can be guaranteed. To adapt to practical needs, it was supplemented during the lectures that when a woman is too old to be addressed by her name, "XX Shi" is allowed.</p>
<p>(2) "Concubine" has no legal status if married after May 5, 1931. It is not appropriate to register her in the household register. According to the Ministry of Interior's letter Yu Hu Zi No. 1110 dated November 20, 1933, and the Yu Hu Er Dian dated 1946, it should be filled in as "Cohabitant" or other family member (not just the word "Family Member," pay attention).</p>
<p>(3) Household registration is based on the application of the people. If the people apply to list two or more wives, the household registration authority cannot refuse to register, because the household registration authority is a detached registration agency, not a stakeholder of the people.</p>

<h3>Talking About Actors' Attitudes</h3>
<p>— Gao Heng</p>
<p>Actors—performing artists, have a direct relationship with the audience on stage. They convey the playwright's and director's consciousness and emotions in the performance. They carry out the task of art in education. They must enable the audience to understand and recognize art. Therefore, in each performance, directors, playwrights, stage workers, and even many enthusiastic art audiences place great hope on the actors, because the actors account for a large element of the success of a play.</p>
<p>Therefore, many actors must be as cautious, humble, diligent, and progressive as if they were facing a deep abyss or walking on thin ice in terms of skill training, artistic cultivation, and life attitude; in order to ensure their own achievements and for the future of the entire drama industry.</p>
<p>However, there are quite a few actors who are obsessed with their own acting skills, stubbornly clinging to their own artistic concepts, distorting the purpose of the performance, being sloppy in rehearsals, improvising during performances; the depravity of private life is beyond what you can imagine, what is stage cooperation, artistic conscience is even more irrelevant to me!</p>
<p>Naturally, this cannot be completely negated! There are also actors with profound attainments in Shanghai in recent years. But there are too few.</p>
<p>An actor must do: seek seriousness in art, seek sincerity in rehearsals, never be sloppy during performances, and not boast after performances, be serious in learning spirit, not be chaotic in life attitude, not casually mooch, not arbitrarily guerilla, be able to do not a "performer" but a "dramatic artist."</p>
<p>Currently, the most serious theatrical atmosphere in Shanghai is the "Audience Performance Company." Their rehearsals, their private lives, their artistic style, and their artistic attitude are all upright, without any perfunctory. This good style is indeed playing a role in several leaders, however, the most important thing is each actor's own self.</p>
<h3>Props and Excitement</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>This issue is often overlooked. This is a fundamental issue; prop managers often consider themselves to be affairs, not artists. Therefore, they often do not add creativity and do things perfunctorily. This leads others to not value　　　, and further to despise workers.</p>
<p>The prop manager of the New Drama Art Institute　　　, like other departments　　, must have superb artistic cultivation,　　　historical foundation, rich social common sense, a spirit of hard work and complaint, and an attitude of earnest study. We must also understand mechanics, aesthetics, and the unity of greatness. Never exceed the integrity of the performing arts. At the same time, we must also have the obligation and conscience to complete the great art required by all departments.</p>
<p>The following classification is made to serve as a path for managers to study:</p>
<p>(1) By country of origin: Chinese furniture is mostly vermilion, rosewood, ochre, and black. The purpose is to create a feeling of solemnity, dignity, and stability. Therefore, the materials are mostly heavy, the lines are mostly straight, the colors are mostly dark, and the structures are mostly complex. Western furniture mostly uses silver, white, yellow, or ochre and red. The purpose is beauty, comfort, and simplicity. Therefore, the materials are mostly light, the lines are mostly round, the colors are mostly bright, and the structures are mostly simple. Especially less use of carving.</p>
<p>(2) By dynasty: In ancient Chinese feudal times, the world was conquered by force. All furniture sought to be powerful and heavy. Therefore, tiger skin armchairs and tiger leg desks were produced. After respecting rituals, tables and chairs sought to be square and upright. Therefore, the back of the chair stood upright and did not tilt. By the time of the flourishing of art in the Tang Dynasty, tables, chairs, and beds exhausted the ability of meticulous carving, changing the old look. During the heyday of Greek architectural art, the structure of tables, chairs, and footrests was extremely beautiful and met gravity; especially the slender and fine round pillar table and chair legs had the meaning of architecture. 18th-century France was accustomed to vanity. Therefore, strange forms, gorgeous carvings, dazzling colors, comfortable cushions, and golden splendor were all available. After the development of modern science, streamlined, comfortable, and beautiful furniture was produced endlessly. This is a gift of the times and also expresses the characteristics of the times.</p>
<p>(3) By type of drama: There are different types and performances of dramas, such as tragedies, comedies, farces, and farces, as well as romantic, classical, realistic, fantasy, and mechanical compositions. All designs for directing, scenery, lighting, acting, costumes, props, and makeup will therefore be different. We know this: tragedies should create an atmosphere that evokes terror and pity, colors should be dark, lines should be straight, and shapes should be heavy. Comedies should create a bright and joyful atmosphere, colors should be bright, lines should be soft, and shapes should be light. Farces and farces should create a humorous and lively atmosphere. Therefore, colors should be bright, lines should be oblique, and shapes should be chaotic and clumsy. Other romantic ones should dare to indulge, classical ones should be familiar with history, realistic ones should be thoughtful and meticulous, and fantasy ones should be creative and organized, and mechanically constructed ones should understand mechanics and machinery.</p>
<p>(4) By volume: We call large volumes furniture or large props, and small volumes decorative small props and personal small props. Large props are no longer described in detail. Decorative small props are small things that decorate the scene. Such as picture frames, vases, books, etc. There is an absolute difference between the wine glasses and tableware at 18th-century banquets and the wine glasses and tableware in China. Similarly, there are also great differences in colors and forms between the Tang Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, and the Republic of China and the post-War of Resistance. As for personal small props, they are full of personality and identity expression. Managers must not ignore them because they are small.</p>
<p>In short, the color of props has not surpassed the form, but it is also not weaker than the form. The general application is between the scenery and the costume. If it is too opposite to the costume and scenery, it will be uncoordinated. If it is too close, it will be easily "eaten" away. However, if the manager can use brilliance and dare to create, all laws will retreat behind wisdom.</p>
<p>When modern Western Europe performed fantasy plays, they used machines to make tables and chairs rotate and change. I also think that managers in our country, whether they use colors, lines, or light and dark, can also give props rotation and change; but this change is internal, not physical, spiritual, not mechanical.</p>
<h3>Review of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"</h3>
<p>— Sun 㫰</p>
<p>I read "Record of the Guangxu Emperor's Personal Rule" in Guilin and found it to be tightly knit and concise. This play writes about national politics from the life of the palace, from waking up early to comb hair, tending the garden, selecting concubines, and celebrating birthdays to discussing national defense and Japanese invaders, from family laws, foreign affairs, national essence, and the Supreme Induction Chapter to writing about the end of the Manchu Qing. And all of this is only for the sake of the Aisin Gioro family, for the sake of Empress Dowager Cixi, and for the sake of Li Lianying. What national affairs, family laws, are actually all the ideas of Chief Eunuch Li alone. And this is indeed a story of recent Chinese history. This story still affects us Chinese people, and this kind of story has been repeated countless times in Chinese history. We should be very familiar with this kind of story.</p>
<p>That Empress Dowager Cixi, she certainly thought of herself as highly talented and virtuous, with great achievements and hard work, and added dozens of nice-sounding titles to herself, but in reality, she was just a capable wealthy woman. She did many bad things, she knew it in her heart, she just didn't allow others to say it, whoever said it, she would kill. But when she killed Kou Liancai, she herself also cried, it seems she still had a little humanity. As for the likes of Li Lianying, they didn't even have this bit of humanity. Before Kou Liancai died, he did not forget to say some vicious words. He was so vicious, yet he demanded that others have a conscience, that's truly beyond comprehension! And Weng Shifu only wanted to pluck Li Hongzhang's peacock feather and take off Li Hongzhang's yellow mandarin jacket, but when asked for money to build the navy, he had none, but when it came to paying indemnities, he could come up with ideas. It can be seen that the government officials at that time were just like this, but Weng Shifu ultimately did not agree with losing power and humiliating the country. Compared with Rong Lu and his ilk, he was far worse. The author often uses contrasting scenes to express these characters profoundly, the structure is rigorous, and the editing is precise. It is indeed very successful in grasping the audience's attention.</p>
<p>I have seen Ye Zi's play many times in Guilin and Zunyi. This time, she really brought out Empress Dowager Cixi's shrewishness, cleverness, meticulousness, cunning, arbitrariness, and ruthlessness. Her several smiles, several times of fake happiness, fake compassion, and several times of concern for Li Lianying, were all performed appropriately and clearly, making it very comfortable to watch. Mr. Yang Hua played Li Lianying, with a tilted head and twisted neck, speaking in a strange voice, acting out a flattering, arrogant, bullying, selfish, self-serving, insidious, and vicious character, winning the audience's resentment. In addition, Kou Liancai's youth—which includes the roles of innocence, justice, and courage—is the only lovable character in the play. Li Hongzhang was first wronged by Weng Shifu and then controlled by Li Lianying. His kind of suffering that he couldn't express was truly rare. The roles in the whole play are very well matched, only that actor, even with the support of Li Lianying's siblings, what he did was not a good thing after all. He was so stubborn that he was not afraid at all in front of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. Isn't that a bit too much!</p>
<h3>Twenty Years of Sound Film</h3>
<p>— Jiang</p>
<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of Warner's release of sound films. Jack L. Warner, the founder of the company, described his efforts for the film industry over the past 20 years. Translating it for reference is not without significance.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the experiment of sound film was successful; our years of work have also yielded some results, but the development of sound film to the present situation, how could anyone have expected it!</p>
<p>When we started the film business, it was only a very small theater reorganized from a department store. At that time, my father pawned his most beloved gold watch to raise the capital for the opening, and the seats were also borrowed in terms of equipment.</p>
<p>It was not until 1912 that we started making films ourselves from running theaters. We have always held the spirit of struggle and adventure, although we have encountered many setbacks; but it has also laid the foundation for our business.</p>
<p>In order to make our ideals come true. In other words, in order to hope for the successful experiment of sound film, we are willing to bet all our financial resources or energy on it. Of course, we finally won; but this victory was seen after a long dark night, and my brother Sam L. Warner died for the business during that time.</p>
<p>As all walks of life celebrate our successful release of sound films, we have also shouldered a new appointment, a work of promoting democracy and making films in line with the democratic trend of the world. American films have indeed fulfilled many obligations for democratic countries, at least they have a deeper understanding of their own environment because of this.</p>
<p>During the war, American films can be said to have lived up to their role as national propaganda tools, and in terms of soldier training, films have also shortened a lot of training time.</p>
<p>We can be proud of the success of sound films, and we are even more proud of our achievements in all aspects over the past 20 years. We can take advantage of opportunities, be responsible, and we have always been running forward!</p>

<h3>Competition of American, British and French Films in the Market</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>If American film companies want to maintain their past advantages in the European market, they will encounter an unprecedented difficult period. In the past, the strong enemy of Hollywood films in Europe was Germany. Now that Germany is defeated, the successors are Britain and France. Because Britain and France will seize the European film market in the future, preparing to produce a large number of films that cater to the audience's psychology.</p>
<p>The British post-war film industry has unique ambitions. In addition to having a large amount of capital, it also cooperates with Hollywood film companies. The foundation has already been laid, as long as it can proceed step by step according to the plan. Once the production of French films increases considerably, they can grab the French film audience. The difficulties that American films will encounter in Europe can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Film industry giants believe that in two or three years, French films will not only be produced in large quantities, but also improve in quality. Especially in stories, new ideals are mixed in. French films are better than Hollywood films in terms of imagination and taste, especially with local characteristics.</p>
<p>European film audiences like new ideals and new technologies. Regarding these, France often has a special skill. But now, if we expect these films to be produced in Paris, it is too early. We can only watch Hollywood produce them. However, the recent Hollywood production "A Scandal in Paris" already has a continental European character, but this kind of film is not very common.</p>
<p>Especially in Hollywood, films are completely commercialized. Ordinary film companies do not make films for the effect of the film, but the only purpose is to make money. Why is this? Because in the past six years, although there has been war, the profits of various film companies have been so high that they have exceeded expectations, so technical aspects have not been fully taken care of. If this style is not changed in the future, it will inevitably lose the overseas market, especially the European market, because there are Britain and France competing with it.</p>
<h3>Chen Dahu Comes to Shanghai to Visit His Family</h3>
<p>Yu School Laosheng (Old Male Role) Chen Dahu, recently flew from Peiping (Beijing) to Shanghai. Personnel from the Queen's Grand Theater also returned to Shanghai on the same plane. It is heard that Chen's trip was because his eldest brother recently returned from Chongqing, so he came to visit him. On his way back, he may stay in Peiping for a while. The photo shows Chen Dahu in his recent performance of "Fishing and Killing Family".</p>
<h3>Today's Garbo, Ingrid Bergman</h3>
<p>— New Fang</p>
<p>A beautiful flower, a virtuous wife and loving mother, a companion in loneliness; Ingrid Bergman was born in this era full of thorns, and she did bring warmth and comfort. Hollywood's film industry cannot do without her, she is simply everyone's dream angel!</p>
<p>What Ingrid Bergman admires most is Garbo. They are both Swedish. Twenty years ago, Hollywood was Garbo's world; now Garbo's position is replaced by Bergman. For decades, the American silver screen has been occupied by Swedes; Garbo and Bergman can be said to have won a lot of glory for their motherland.</p>
<p>Ordinary women are generally fond of vanity and value fame and fortune; this situation is especially obvious in the theater circle, but Ingrid Bergman is an exception. She does not value fame, does not value profit, and does not love any artificial decorations; she has natural beauty, a gentle and virtuous appearance, she treats people with humility, and works seriously; in order to truly praise this artist, and also to truly let the audience know this artist, let us mention a few more things about Bergman. Once, a reporter asked Ingrid Bergman; "Miss Bergman, will you ever retire from the film industry?" Her answer was very funny: "Why do I want to retire from the film industry? Don't you think it would be fun when I am seventy years old to act again!" She must be a career-oriented artist. She is only thirty years old this year, from thirty to seventy there are still forty years! Ingrid Bergman can be said to be an extremely popular star, but she never despises others because of this; she often eats alone in the St. Regis Hotel in New York, and does not like the waiter's excessive courtesy when dining, and the food she eats per meal is absolutely simplified, she never wears a hat when going out or attending banquets, which is also very strange in American society. Ingrid Bergman is serious when working, and is also very loyal to all social or group affairs after work; during the war, she tried her best to promote public bonds, and every time she traveled around to promote public bonds, she always asked her husband before starting: "If you want others to buy public bonds, you must first ask how much we have bought ourselves?", Ingrid Bergman is not willing to lag behind others in saving the country. Her success today is not only her success in the film industry, but also her success in the art of being a person.</p>
<p>Ingrid Bergman's latest work is "Notorious" co-starring with Cary Grant. Including this film, she has only acted in twelve films in Hollywood, but she has already established an immortal reputation for herself!</p>
<h3>Actress Zhao Yunru</h3>
<p>— Zeng Wei</p>
<p>Zhao Yunru, undoubtedly, she is a brilliant star in the drama world. Her trip to the United States to study this time is worth everyone's envy.</p>
<p>When Ms. Zhao was eighteen years old, she became interested in drama. However, her family did not allow her to embark on this path, and sent her to Hankou to study. Unexpectedly, there were also foreign movies in Hankou, and Ms. Zhao would of course go to watch them. She was always interested in acting. One year, she learned that the Nanjing Drama School was recruiting students, and she was determined to apply, but how to go was a difficult problem, but she finally found a solution, she had an uncle in Nanjing, so she went to visit him.</p>
<p>In that exam, there were five hundred applicants, and only thirty passed. Women accounted for only eight of the thirty, and Ms. Zhao was one of them. When this news reached her family in Suzhou, they all felt sorry for her, saying that she was an unfilial daughter.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and Ms. Zhao transferred from Nanjing to Yichang, and finally to Chongqing, and became a drama star.</p>
<p>She performed "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" in Chongqing for more than forty days in a row, and the box office was of course good. This play was performed for six hours every day, and she needed to be on stage for five hours, so you can imagine how tiring it was.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhao was very timid when she first appeared on stage in Chongqing. Later, she worked hard to make her performance realistic. Once, she was wearing lipstick, draped in an old coat, and leaning against a telegraph pole while smoking a cigarette. An old woman who was a prostitute said to her: "Your luck is not good today!" So she knew that her role-playing was good. She was able to practice the role-playing of peasant women and village women like this.</p>

<h3>The Growth of American Literature and Its Characteristics</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Some say that although American literature has a history of three hundred years, its prosperity is only a matter of yesterday. In terms of American history, this is indeed the case. However, although the growth period of American literature is shorter than that of the Old Continent, just as the founding of the United States has its unique spirit, American literature also has its own independent spiritual characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of the founding background of the United States, the early helpers of American literature naturally took Puritanism as the core; strictly speaking, there was no so-called American literature at that time, there were only religious literature and historical records and a few poems. Such as William Bradford (1590-1657)'s "History of the Plymouth Colony"; John Winthrop (1568-1649)'s "History of New England"; Cotton Mother's "History of the New England Church," etc.; in terms of rhyme, such as Michael WiggWiggorth (1631-1705)'s long poem "The Day of Doom," and the female poet Anne Bradstreet (1612-72)'s "The Tenth Muse," and so on.</p>
<p>These things were all works before American independence. At that time, American capitalism was still in its infancy, and its literary expression could only rely on the anti-religious spirit.</p>
<p>But the New World is a uniquely blessed place in terms of resources, and at the same time, the American immigrants who came from religious oppression in the Old Continent had to have a spirit that was close to reality and full of adventure due to the enlightenment of the environment. Therefore, there was a simultaneous formation of a dialectical existence with religious literature, and what completely replaced religious literature in no time was not the so-called "Yankee spirit."</p>
<p>If Puritanism can be said to be a relic brought from the Old Continent, then Yankeeism can be said to be entirely a product that came with the independent development of the American capitalist economy in its early stages. In the era of Puritanism, although immigrants from the Old Continent to America resisted their mother country economically, they were still somewhat influenced by the Old Continent spiritually. However, with the independent development of the American economy, its spiritual centrifugal tendency to the Old Continent became increasingly obvious. Yankeeism is a product of this spiritual centrifugal tendency. The initial revelation of Yankeeism's resistance was also in the political aspect. A new economic representative class emerged, such as Benjamin Franklin, who was a typical representative of the emerging American middle class at that time. His "Autobiography" and "Poor Richard's Almanac" not only had political ideas and life philosophies that were very different from Puritanism, but also broke away from the traditional religious odor in its literary expression and took a unique path.</p>
<p>Of course, Franklin cannot be said to be a representative figure in American literature at that time; at the same time, because the American independence movement quickly achieved success, the political resistance movement did not get the opportunity to develop fully in American literary history; on the contrary, because the independence movement was quickly achieved and economic development progressed by leaps and bounds, a general optimism and hope in life made the newborn American literature advocate a free and happy spirit. In terms of American literary history, this was the era of American romanticist literature. The literary representatives of this period can be said to be Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and William Cullen Bryant.</p>
<p>However, in the strict sense, the works of Irving and others have not yet completely eliminated the color of Puritanism, which is naturally related to the education of these people themselves. The truly independent and free period of American literature should be said to have started around the time of the Civil War. During this period, the United States began to produce its own great writers, whose reputations were all unsurpassed by world writers. Such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote "The Scarlet Letter," Ralph Waldo Emerson, a writer and philosopher, John Pendleton Kennedy, a pastoral writer, Edgar Allan Poe, a humorous writer Mark Twain... these great writers integrated and developed the literary development path of Europe over the centuries on the basis of America's own unique foundation in a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, what exactly is the American spirit expressed in the American literary development path that ultimately came from Puritanism and Yankeeism? This can be observed from two angles, that is, in the case of expressing personality, the American literary spirit is the spirit of individualism, and in the case of experiencing society, it is the spirit of liberalism. These two things that seem contradictory at first glance are actually a complete unity of the American spirit and cannot be separated. The early American literature's tendency towards mysticism, as well as the modern American literature's tendency towards vulgarity (or, more euphemistically, mass tendency), are the respective characteristics of Puritanism and Yankeeism. However, in modern times, mysticism has been gradually replaced by vulgarism; although the literature of individualism has not been completely eliminated, the promotion of the spirit of liberalism seems to be more characteristic of the modern American literary spirit. Writers of the Theodore Drelser and Haiqing school are mass and liberal writers.</p>
<p>The reason why the American literary spirit has timely characteristics is that the earliest colonists of the United States were originally people from the Old Continent. Although they emigrated to the New Continent for superficial religious reasons, the foundation of their spirit was still the tradition of the Old Continent; its early literature's flow from religious color to mysticism can be said to be the result of the interaction between the old legend and the new Jing Suo's expectations. The so-called new expectations mean that the development of the American colonies not only attracted immigrants from Britain, but also attracted a complex and powerful people of various races from all over the world. The reason why the United States calls itself the United States of America just illustrates the complex nature of the entire composition. From conservative Puritanism to gradual development into Yankeeism, this is how the unique spirit of the American character in the Moonlight appeared. Up to now, the lively, unrestrained, realistic, and almost romantic Yankeeism is still the basic characteristic of American literature today. Understanding this point, we can then observe modern American literature.</p>
<h3>Milestone (Plus One)</h3>
<p>— Peng Aohan</p>
<p>Pointing out the direction for travelers of life, the milestone stands alone and lonely at the desolate intersection</p>
<p>Having encountered many times of wind and rain, the milestone still stands stubbornly with its bare and smooth body. …</p>
<p>From the remote era, when mankind opened up routes, milestones were placed at this intersection that easily confused travelers.</p>
<p>With a good heart to help others, the milestone gives travelers a sudden comfort.</p>
<p>"And life! But it is so dry and bumpy!"</p>
<p>When the milestone complained in a low voice, I sighed softly. …</p>
<h3>Floating Smoke and Distant Peaks</h3>
<p>— Qing Dynasty Wang Jian</p>
<h3>Cemetery</h3>
<p>Longing for the desolation and mystery in the cemetery, I silently stepped into the chaotic and messy mounds</p>
<p>Those piles of protruding yellow mounds! How many dreams of nameless heroes have been buried!</p>
<p>The glorious deeds of the past should now be historical terms.</p>
<p>When the green will-o'-the-wisps jumped on the edge of the cemetery, I could still hear the weeping of the mournful ghosts. …</p>
<p>"This tragic final destination!"</p>
<p>So, I slowly, with a sad mood, mourned the undying heroic spirits of the dead</p>
<h3>Song of Feeling After Opening the American Military Food Box</h3>
<p>— Bao Luo</p>
<p>Food boxes are sold in the market, said to be American military rations; how can the distribution of rations be unlimited? Many soldiers died and were wounded!</p>
<p>The stacked boxes are tightly aligned, filled with sugar and fruit, fragrant lemon acidity, rich and strong coffee bitterness, I light a cigarette, quietly remembering the past and present!</p>
<p>After the meal, there is a residual taste, leaving this to know who it is? The bones in the sandy field are cold, and relatives and friends are crying sadly</p>
<p>The weather is cold and the wind and snow are severe, the guest's soul is lonely and alone! The world is not completely settled, I advise everyone not to rush to change the transmission circuit. And wait for the evil atmosphere to be cleansed, when spring arrives, I will return to write poems. I secretly laugh at my parents shedding tears together, and the babies cry tiredly and fall asleep quickly. The fragrant grass is lush and green, and we play and dance together. From then on, the days will be peaceful, and we will not worry about the beacon fires and enjoy the heavenly years!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 54</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I was also confused at first, but after chasing a few more steps, my heart suddenly moved, and I couldn't help but shout out, "It's over!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" the young captain slowed down and asked.</p>
<p>"After turning around this mound, it's our power station," I pointed in the direction of the three guys and said. "Probably our place has been occupied by them, and there may be a large team stationed there!"</p>
<p>The leader stopped immediately after hearing this and gave a gesture to his colleagues. Everyone gathered around as soon as they saw it: only one person straightened the hand-held machine gun and stood aside to take guard. (This is a trained regulation, a natural action step, no need to issue another order). The leader asked me to explain the terrain of the radio station on the other side of the mountain. I immediately pointed out the direction and terrain. The leader then very skillfully gave the order: five people in a team, with the power station in front of the mountain as the center, surrounded from left and right, and asked me to join a team at random. I agreed to walk on the highway side with the leader.</p>
<p>I understood his division very well; probably after he heard me explain the terrain, because he didn't know the enemy's strength, but it might be quite strong, he expected that after the few guys who escaped reported back, they might all come over the mountain to copy our back road. If so, we would be able to sandwich them from both sides with such a division. In case their team still took the road where the three people escaped, and they came to meet us head-on, we could also attack from the front and back, just wait for our division to reach the front of the mountain.</p>
<p>Who knew that we explored step by step, and when we reached the front of the mountain, we saw at a glance that our residence (radio station) was empty, and only a burst of burning gas, mixed with the smell of smoke, rolled up from the foot of the mountain. Our residence was still intact. But turning our faces to see the power plant at the foot of the mountain, there were two places emitting thick smoke. Looking at the top of the mountain again, it was as if there were no traces of people. When we got to the side of the house, we explored it very carefully, fearing an ambush, but our division had already sent a signal, indicating that they had not seen any enemy traces, so we attacked an empty place. This was because we overestimated the strength of the people.</p>
<p>At this time, I didn't care about anything, I just told the young leader that I wanted to search the house. The leader assigned people to their posts and explored the house with me. The first thing to check was of course my office and the generator. I couldn't wait to flash into the room, and saw that everything had been moved. I rushed to the head of the kang and opened the cabinet, and there was nothing left, even a few clothes that were used for cover were taken away. This was of course expected. But I was also very sad in my heart. Because that generator was very difficult to get, this thing is not only a non-selling product, but there are only a few of them in Japan now. Just as I was staring at the closet in a daze, the room suddenly lit up. It turned out that the sky was getting dark, and I could no longer see things clearly in the room. It was the leader who turned on the light.</p>
<p>With this light, one thing in the closet flashed into my eyes; it was a symbol drawn with a red pencil, and "〇四" was written next to it. I was overjoyed, this symbol indicates that the thing was taken away by number 〇四; at the same time, I can also find him based on this symbol. But now it is even more urgent, I think it is still the safety issue of Dingyuan's family and the children in the Road Bureau power plant. Because in our station, number 〇四 is a leader. He took things away, and the houses here were not burned. He and the other accomplices, whether they were trained, some experienced men and women, probably had already escaped. Thinking of this, I couldn't care about anything else, I just turned around and explained to the leader that I wanted to go to the power plant to visit Dingyuan's family and other refugees.</p>
<h3>The Key</h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>To have a home, or to have a room of one's own, to be able to close the door and enjoy a limited freedom, to sit, lie, and move according to one's own habits, without having to worry about a pair of eyes watching you, staring at you, without feeling flustered. In this environment that belongs to oneself, one can maintain a calm mood, and arrange and deal with everything according to one's own likes and dislikes. Whether rich or poor, wise or foolish, if given such an environment, there is no reason to complain about the unfairness of fate.</p>
<p>Happiness cannot be separated from troubles, and fate is always to be complained about. Some people have a house, but before they can enjoy their share of happiness, troubles follow them like a shadow. Their hearts are as if chained, their hands and feet as if shackled. This small piece of freedom that belongs to them, yet those who live inside it are like prisoners in a jail. It is easy to be blamed for anything, and one must constantly reflect. When troubles come, problems multiply. Even a good-natured person can easily become abnormal, and cherished objects may be smashed with one's own hands. Things that are always with you sometimes lose their direction, or a manuscript that is right at hand, when you need it, refuses to appear no matter how much you call for it. Even more often, you might forget yourself outside the door. No matter how tired you are, how sleepy you are, even though with a simple movement you could curl up like a cat and throw yourself onto the bed. However, fate loves to play tricks on you, and your hand falls empty. A door separates you from another world. Curse it! A careless person deserves to be punished. Scolding yourself, hitting yourself is useless. It might be late at night, and the help you long for is unavailable. Unwilling to turn to friends, you have to risk showing off your skills, climbing walls and jumping through windows. In dire straits, anyone can play the hero from the Seven Heroes and Five Gallants. Afterwards, you might even boast about your innate ability to walk on walls, secretly rejoicing that you didn't fall and get hurt. No matter what you say, taking risks is always a last resort. No one deliberately punishes themselves. The painful thing is that innate troubles are invisible shadows, and you never know when they will follow you and demand a reckoning. Even the smartest person cannot find peace unless they suddenly disappear from the crowd, and there is no longer a self, so that troubles have no way to take root.</p>
<p>The consequences of troubles can be very serious. When the problem comes, even if you are a six-foot-tall strong man, you cannot turn yourself into various shapes and squeeze into various holes. At this time, even a gentleman wishes he had the cleverness of a thief, so that a piece of iron or a lead wire could get him whatever he wants. In human society, as long as there are thieves who live by their wits, human troubles will never be eliminated. Because of this, troubles become parasitic plants, able to take root anywhere, climbing and spreading, reaching friends, close relatives, and even couples in the same bed. Many secretly hide an invisible key, hoping to secretly check each other's secrets when the opportunity arises. You can't blame parents for being biased, because bias originates from selfish thoughts, and selfish thoughts arise from considerations of gains and losses. Whether emotional or material, everything starts from oneself. The most difficult thing between people is trust, and the easiest thing to lose is human affection, which is due to the inability to trust others.</p>
<p>What can be done? You tell me?</p>
<p>It seems that the most enviable thing in urban life is tall buildings, but in these layers of tall buildings, with their many doors, people living inside may all be happy, but how many can come and go freely? Even in their own small world, opening the door is still not enough to unlock the cabinets and drawers. Who are they locking up? Carrying a bunch of keys, the clanging sound, is it praising one's cleverness, or satirizing one's stupidity? If one is careless, the owner of the keys may lock himself into the hell of troubles. Who should be blamed then?</p>
<p>I curse keys from the bottom of my heart. From morning till night, coming and going, eating and going to the toilet, this bunch of keys always follows me like a shadow, always within half a foot of my sight. Losing the keys is like losing myself. I have been locked out, I have risked climbing the windows of a four-story building... As a result, I cannot help but regard it as my shadow, not even the closest person can leave me for a second. But I don't like it at all. It only gives me troubles, it threatens my freedom, it increases my distrust of people. Even of myself, the result of thinking about it day and night, I suspect that my nerves are not sound. But I don't have the courage to throw it away unless I leave this world.</p>
<p>When can I throw away this chain, break these shackles, jump out of this prison, and fly to the truly free world?</p>
<p>Is there such a place in the world? Where no one picks up lost items, and doors are left unlocked... When children come into the world, grow up and enter school, read history, and then go to museums to see the foolish relics left by these clever ancestors—keys and locks. If there really is such a day, there will never be war in the world.</p>

<h3>Tantrums</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>"Heaven is silent, only humans speak."</p>
<p>However, human words added together become trust. If there is no trust, then human words are frightening. We see the hurricane-like surge of the U.S. dollar in the Shanghai market, forcing market chaos, and the Foreign Exchange Association has to take emergency measures to stop U.S. dollar transactions, and the cause is a "foreign exchange rates will be adjusted appropriately at any time," which increases the reporters' caution and attitude of walking on thin ice.</p>
<p>The market's nerves are extremely sharp and sensitive, and rumors are often created. If you give it the opportunity to attach to it, how can you avoid taking the opportunity to make waves? Of course, in the speculation of ups and downs, some people have made a fortune, but most people have suffered. Before the war, the economic situation was stable, and speculation was limited to a few people, and the impact on the market and people's livelihood was not great, but now, the so-called pull one hair and move the whole body, U.S. dollars, gold, cotton yarn, rice, ... any rise and fall, all prices change with it, so the windfall made by those few people is squeezed and looted from the lives of most of us.</p>
<p>Here, we must praise Mr. Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank. Since taking office, he has always maintained a style of never speaking, and silently fighting against speculators. His hard fights have been experienced three times, the new foreign exchange adjustment in August, the U.S. dollar fluctuation in late September, and this surge. In addition, there are a number of large and small financial adjustment events. Like this time, the Central Bank threw 2,000 bars of gold, which is a powerful mainstream to curb the surge. From these places, we can understand that those in charge have not neglected their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Passes</h3>
<p>— Hongyu</p>
<p>Before the war, in the Shanghai concessions, all were the power of foreigners. Although the territory was in China, the equality of foreigners' treatment of Chinese people was difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Take the British-owned tram company as an example. Foreigners buy monthly passes, the procedures are simple, and absolutely no photos are required. The Chinese are much more troublesome. First, they have to sign a contract that cannot violate the company's regulations, and then they issue a notice to take a photo at a designated photo studio before the procedure is complete. It takes three to five days to get the so-called "tram pass."</p>
<p>Their reason is that foreigners (including Japanese and White Russians) are all trustworthy and ethical, so photos are not required on monthly passes. If the Chinese do not use photos, they will definitely not use them themselves, lend them to others, and others will not use them, but also transfer them to third parties. In this way, there is no way to investigate, which easily causes losses to the tram company. Therefore, the Chinese must attach photos to their monthly passes. This is simply insulting the Chinese. It is also the Chinese's fault for not living up to expectations. If they can work together and not take his tram, see if this British tram company will not close down.</p>
<p>However, during the period of the fall, after the company changed to "military management," the Japanese used the "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" to win over our compatriots, and even the photos on the tram passes were all cancelled. We will never thank him for this preferential treatment, because he has already pasted our photos on the "citizen's card" that he must check at any time.</p>
<p>After the restoration of the land, the Shanghai concessions have been taken back. Although the tram company is still run by British merchants, it is controlled by our municipal government's public utilities bureau. How do I know that my tram pass today is still the same as before, the Chinese still have to paste photos, and the photos in the past were taken for free by the company, but now they have to do it themselves. Isn't this worse?</p>
<h3>Numbness</h3>
<p>— Kuiran</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau is in charge of him, and has the right to order the abolition of insulting photos on monthly passes. I specially offer my opinion in writing, and I hope that the Public Utilities Bureau will implement it soon!</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Weiyan's "Longer Review" in the October 3rd edition of this newspaper's publishing industry, I feel that not only is the administrative efficiency of our government slow, but the rate of handling affairs by the people is also unparalleled!</p>
<p>The author is a middle school geography teacher. The junior high school geography textbook taught in the last semester was Zhonghua's version. In the first chapter of the second volume, Fujian Province, there is a section on Taiwan, which is still "... bordering the Taiwan Strait to the east, suitable for the hub of traffic between the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and facing the lost island of Taiwan." Section 2, Guangdong Province: "The so-called leased land is Guangzhou Bay on the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula. ... Occupied by the French in the 24th year of Guangxu, and leased to them by contract in the following year for a period of ninety-nine years, the French opened it as a complete military port."</p>
<p>At that time, it had been four months since the victory. I once wondered why the booksellers were so numb? Why not revise these two sections? Maybe it was too late to complete the procedures, so it was issued casually. But it has been half a year, and the second volume of geography textbooks issued to students this semester has not changed the slightest bit about these two sections. The strangest thing is that according to his publication date, it is August 30th. I don't understand, wasn't there a textbook shortage last semester? Why are there still textbooks printed in the 30th year that students read this semester? It is no problem to read textbooks printed in the 30th year in the 35th year. However, after a major change in the era, geography cannot be vague in these few years. And now what I have discovered, there are already the above two major problems, and there must be other places that do not meet the current application, and must not have been revised at all.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past, the Japanese attached great importance to geographical research. It is said that you can find a bookstore in Japan that specializes in selling Chinese geography. During the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, the first thing the enemy did in education was to change geography textbooks and confiscate maps in bookstores and libraries. Under this painful contrast, we feel ashamed even though we have won. After reading Mr. Weiyan's introduction and reflecting on the geography book I teach, it is more than just shame, it is simply that the education authorities and publishers are generally numb!</p>
<h3>It is said that there is such a thing - sleeping for thirty-nine years</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling translated from Journal of Amreican Pharmaeutical Associltion July 1946</p>
<p>Survival is the basic desire of everyone, but disgust and dissatisfaction with reality are also common human traits. Many people want to leave this troubled world for a considerable period of time, wake up after a few years, and live a new life. So in the story of "Rip Van Winkle," this Rip slept for twenty years, woke up and the world had changed, and his old friends did not recognize each other, as if he were in another new world.</p>
<p>Recently, American zoologists discovered a roundworm Nematodes that slept for twice as long as Rip - thirty-nine years. This worm, scientifically named Tylenchus Polyhypnus, had five of these worms sleeping on a piece of dry wheat leaf that had been preserved for thirty-nine years. This worm, which sleeps for such a long time, has set a new record in the animal kingdom.</p>
<h3>Mencius' Mother Moved Three Times</h3>
<p>— Wangwu</p>
<p>Mr. Bu, a neighbor, is well-read in ancient books. This time he "returned" to Shanghai, and his residence was occupied, but he still enjoyed it! Recently, he has innovated his thinking and is seeking a proper educational environment for his grandson, following Mencius' mother's intention of moving three times. He moved from Caojiadu to Nanshi, and then from Nanshi to Yuyuan Road. Recently, he has found a new home on Masnan Road, and his field property has been sold out. I am at peace.</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>

<p>Strange News of Trials of Traitors</p>
<p>After Wang Yitang, the No. 1 traitor in North China, was sentenced to death, he suddenly published advertisements in various newspapers in Beiping, saying that He Chengzhuo, the presiding judge of the case, was a "small traitor under his rule." Trying a traitor with a traitor (the small traitor in parentheses tries the No. 1 big traitor) is one oddity;</p>
<p>Since the traitor Wang Yitang had known that the presiding judge was a "small traitor under his rule," why didn't he pretend to be dead and not say it at the time, but instead revealed it afterwards? Outsiders don't know if there is an article in this, the second oddity;</p>
<p>Some people say that this may be "a dog bites Lu Dongbin, not knowing a good heart," because the traitor in parentheses is a real traitor, or an underground worker, we dare not speculate, but looking at the newspapers, He Chengzhuo himself does not seem to deny it, and does not mention underground work, the third oddity;</p>
<p>The newspapers in Beiping do not seem to be afraid of the suspicion of He Chengzhuo being a traitor, otherwise they would not have rashly published this irresponsible "traitor advertisement." (If this example is opened, there will be many traitor advertisements in the future!) Is it to protect Wang Yitang? Is it to attack He Chengzhuo? Is it to greed for advertising revenue? It seems that none of them are, but it also seems that they are all related, the fourth oddity;</p>
<p>As a dignified presiding judge, being bitten back by Wang Yitang, who has been sentenced to death, in terms of judicial dignity and official prestige, it is really "too that!" The fifth oddity;</p>
<p>When Wang Yitang will be executed is still unpredictable, and he may even apply for a retrial, or even develop an "case in a case," the sixth oddity! Is a dog biting Lu Dongbin?</p>
<h3>Today's Dim Sum</h3>

<p>Bitter Clear Tea, (This has to be wronged everyone, because the officials who are investigating are also bitter enough.)</p>
<h3>Record of Robbery</h3>
<p>— Yidan</p>
<p>When the weather is cool but not cold, the thugs have already begun to move.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo station and its vicinity outside Xiaonanmen were devastated by enemy bombs during the Shanghai War. Now, more than a year after the victory, it is still a wilderness.</p>
<p>If you want to go from Datong University to China Electric Company, you have to cross this wilderness of about several hundred yards. There are no outposts, no street lights, and there are weeds and messy bricks, cement ditches. It is even more deserted at night, which makes pedestrians uneasy and coachmen afraid.</p>
<p>A few days ago, at about 10:00 p.m., a neighbor, Old Sun, had just passed Datong University when he was chased up by a thug, wearing a broken hat, greasy and broken tops, holding a "weapon" in his hand, and yelling, "Where are you going?" About 30,000 legal tender was robbed, and then he threw a handkerchief of smoke and other things, and then pushed him hard. Another accomplice suddenly rushed out from a hidden place and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Such road robberies seem to be regarded as trivial matters, but looking at it in depth, you will feel that it is a social problem and also a public security problem in the suburbs. Now, before a fundamental solution can be found, it is proposed that the relevant Penglai District authorities should be asked to set up a police station there, and send police to guard it, and install a red light on the top of the station, which will be no less effective than a lighthouse in the Black Sea. Otherwise, when the cold wind is howling, the thugs will be even more rampant. What about our pedestrians?</p>

<h3>Please Think About It</h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>Think about it: Are the following situations in line with your subconscious?</p>
<p>(1) When someone asks you, you agree readily, but in your heart "don't look at anything"; Lao Tzu said: "Those who promise lightly must have little faith." Are you this kind of person?</p>
<p>(2) When you are a daughter-in-law, you complain everywhere about the bad things about your mother-in-law, but when your son marries a daughter-in-law, you complain everywhere that "my son has a wife and doesn't want his old mother!" Think about it, are you like this yourself?</p>
<p>(3) Do you think that the "feng shui" of your parents' graves will affect your wealth, so you find all the "feng shui" masters to bury your parents, but use this to praise your filial piety?</p>
<p>(4) When you print on your parents' funeral notices "Unfilial and so on, the sins are deep, not to perish, but to extend the life of the late father... and so on," do you know that this is the "No. 1" nonsense?</p>
<h3>Outsider's View</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>This is the dialectic of Yan'an: If Mao Zedong becomes the chairman of the "Soviet People's Committee of the Republic of China" and the general secretary of the party, Zhou Enlai must be the chairman of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee, and of course Zhu De is the supreme commander of the Red Army of the Republic of China. "Rewarding merits and awarding rewards" should be like this.</p>
<p>A young man said: "Under the rule of the Republic of China government, it is really too difficult to climb to the position of chairman or committee member in one step. If you join the Communist Party, you may get a letter of appointment as a committee member in a few days!"</p>
<p>A person who runs a party said that the purpose of running a party is to gain political power. Who can deny this sentence? A person who joins a certain party said: This is a shortcut to seek an official at risk!</p>
<h3>Written to Parents</h3>
<p>— Hesong</p>
<p>The child came back from school, carrying a schoolbag. The schoolbag was full of books and many notebooks and exercise books. The child was very happy because the day's course was finally over, and he could play happily for a while.</p>
<p>The mother took the schoolbag and opened the notebooks and exercise books one by one, and said to the child, this is wrong, that is wrong; also, why is the arithmetic only 70 points, why can't Chinese get "super"?</p>
<p>The child's "happiness" turned into sorrow. He thought: This is the price he paid for studying for a day!</p>
<p>On the bright side, the child was stimulated by his mother and aroused his desire to be an "excellent student," and from then on he studied harder; on the bad side, the child felt that his efforts were a waste, and became negative and discouraged.</p>
<p>I would like to give a loyal warning to parents, don't always be critical of your children, but on the contrary, you should always encourage them! Encouragement is more effective than criticism.</p>
<p>Whenever a child puts on new shoes, his mother always says to him: "Hey, don't ruin these shoes, if you ruin them, you won't have shoes to wear!"</p>
<p>Therefore, the child dare not run, for fear of ruining the shoes, dare not jump, for fear of ruining the shoes; dare not play, dare not exercise! Shoes restrict everything and become shackles for children.</p>
<p>However, wise parents, you must know how important it is for children to move, play, and exercise... Don't sacrifice the health of the next generation for the sake of "shoes"!</p>
<p>Not long ago, an incident occurred: a fifth-grade elementary school student committed suicide because he could not be promoted.</p>
<p>We can imagine that when the child knew that he was "held back," his parents must have given him severe criticism - or even a beating. (In fact, I have seen this kind of thing many times.) The child could not bear this punishment and took his own life.</p>
<p>I am not encouraging children to be held back, but I want to tell you that school scores cannot accurately indicate whether a child is "good" or "bad," and setbacks in learning (such as being held back) are normal phenomena. Don't think that a child who is held back is useless and unteachable, and give him unbearable punishment!</p>
