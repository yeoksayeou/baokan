<h3>首都紀念禁煙節　主席頒訓詞勉肅清大敵</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕六三禁煙節紀念大會，今晨進行，由馬市長主持，到新警察廳長衛生局長等長官暨民眾二千餘人，主席等各致講詞後，並有京音大鼓演唱，題為「肅清煙毒與新生活」，會後即將就廣場焚燬。至去歲九月迄今三月，所拿獲之煙毒煙具，計煙毒六四另兩，煙具二另四九件。又自偽首都地方法院檢察署交之煙毒等件，一時烈燄　天，圍觀市民，　呼口號，午後尚未熄滅。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕蔣主席三日對首都各界六三禁煙節紀念大會，頒佈訓詞原詞如下：內政部張部長，禁煙委員會王主任委員，並轉六三禁煙大會，本屆禁煙紀念大會，舉行於抗戰勝利，政府還都以後，此其意義重大，實超越於尋常。吾人抗戰建國之目的，在謀國家民族之自立自強，今抗戰之任難稱，建國之業方始，吾民族行將踔厲奮發，以負荷更爲艱鉅之任務，對於國民體質之加強，與民族健康之增進，實爲此時最迫切之要求。回溯鴉片流毒我國，瞬歷百年，久爲我民族生存發展之大敵，戰前政府六年禁煙政策，不幸因敵侵入，而功虧一簣，尤以淪陷區域，敵人對我同胞之毒化陰謀，險狠毒辣，實無所不用其極，政府雖決心禁毒，而權力有所不及，莫可如何。今幸失土光復，金砙無缺，貫徹戰前未竟之功，掃清寇潛留之毒，在政府責無旁貸，凡我同胞，亦必凜然於自由得來之不易，奮發新生之朝氣，戒絕不良之污染，以符強國強民之實。倘使煙毒一日未能肅清，即無異敵人一日盤踞未去，非惟民族生命，仍受腐蝕，建國事業，無由着手，且無以對國父暨先賢先烈在天之靈，與並世友邦對我之期望。政府於此，自當貫注全力，務於最短期間，徹底肅清此一大敵，凡屬接受區域，在政府權力充分達到後六個月內，必期完成禁絕，不容再有煙毒發現，其在邊僻地帶，　民往往私種毒卉資爲姦利者，尤必嚴密注意查剷，毋稍疏忽。總之，政府對於煙毒，不論種運售吸，均視為我國人民之公敵，定當臨以嚴邢峻法，決不稍有寬假，各級政府官吏，應知禁煙責任之重大，不特攸關政績之所成，且爲各人應盡之天職，如果執行不力，任令煙禁廢弛，固難逃法紀之制裁，亦應受良心世道，深明大義之人，尤盼於族黨親朋之間，輾轉告誡，切遵禁令，毋或觸犯，共本除毒務盡之精神，期收條除舊染之實效，庶幾上下風氣，於以不變，國際觀聽，爲之一新，有厚望焉。蔣中正。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕聯總遠東區域委員會召開在即，行總蔣署長延戰，定三日晚由滬乘車來京，指示會前之各項準備事宜，畫家司徒喬最近歷經粵·桂·湘·鄂·豫五省所作之災情寫生，亦將於該會開幕之日，在京展覽，俾各國代表於會中討論下年度救濟物資分配問題時，有所參考。現遠東區域委員會會議議程，尚未全部擬定，迄今所知者，即會議由蔣署長主席，聯總遠東司長兼駐華　事處長雷氏，爲大會秘書，聯總在遠東之工作及有關中國之善後救濟問題，將爲會中主要討論之議題。至於延長聯總在華工作期限一事，亦可能予以商討。本屆會期預定三日，必要時可能延長，七日上午十時半在國際聯歡社舉行開幕式時，允許新聞記者參加，其餘各項討論，均採秘密方式，每日會後，由行總舉行記者招待會，將全日可能發表之新聞，予以宣佈。遠東區域委員會與會各代表及其顧問人員等，目前多以來京。據悉，澳代表爲駐華公使高伯蘭，法爲駐華大使柏理靄，印度爲駐華專員梅農，荷爲施達克，英爲施丹特，美爲紀培德，至於紐西蘭菲律賓及蘇聯之代表名單尚未悉。</p>
<h3>停戰復路及實施整軍　爲全國急迫需要　周恩來昨訪馬歇爾長談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕蔣主席返京後之政局動向，各方面頗多揣測，惟據此間某權威人士透露：政府之既定方針，不致因東北之新形勢而有所變更。所可慮者，共黨在東北受挫後之今日，顯已重彈其（全面停戰）及（誠意協商）之老調，而暗中則藉此空隙從事軍事新部署，蓋即以東北而言，兩月之後，當地青紗帳起，實乃共軍騷擾之有利條件也。故目前政府方面和平談判之門固始終洞開，但鑒往知來，似已暗示此種忍讓乃爲有最高限度者，而即在此　等待期間，軍事方面亦將一改過去的消極防衛，而採取積極防衛，因四平街，長春之經驗，徒苦人民，徒耗國力，已使政府被迫出此也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕，今新任參謀長陳誠，在中樞紀念週報告東北軍事動態，於分析四平街一役戰況後，以堅決之語氣略述渠個人對於國是之觀感，謂決不反對和平解決東北問題，亦不反對任何一方對於停戰之要求，更不反對以政治協商方式解決當前之爭端，惟循上見諸方式而進行，必須有時間上之確實限度，蓋老百姓實在拖不起，真正之停戰及交通之恢復，固爲我全國急迫需要。而整軍計劃之全面實施，亦應同時進行。</p>

<h3>主席對青年軍　廣播訓詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕全國青年遠征軍（除二零七師士兵自願延長服役外）自六月起已開始退伍，蔣主席特於三日晚九時對該軍各師士兵廣播訓詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>我們國民革命軍青年遠征軍全體士兵，入伍已經有一年餘了，道一年餘的中間，我們國家經過艱苦的奮鬥，獲得了抗戰最後的勝利，我們青年遠征軍士兵服役亦已屆退伍的期限了。在這退伍時期，我特別要告訴我們全體官兵子弟們，你們對於過去一年在本軍受訓的經過，應該切實反省，你們究竟有些什麽心得，這種訓練，對於你們將來一生事業的前途，有些什麽關係，今後你們對於國家和革命，應該作何種貢獻，這些問題在你們退伍之前，必須有詳細的研究和認識，然後絕不辜負你們此次來入伍受訓的志願。</p>
<p>你們自從前年底在抗戰形勢最危急的時候，響應本委員長的號召，來參加革命行列，你們在這一年有餘的入伍期間，對於軍事的學問和技術，固然有了很大的進步，而你們在生活行動上所受的訓練，更是特別的重要，這是其他普通學校和社會上所不能得到的一種最可寶貴的訓練。只要你們能本着這種已經得到的訓練，退伍以後，在任何國體以內，仍舊能繼續不斷的身體力行，始終一貫，自強不息，則將來一定可以成功立業，不失爲一個民眾的領導者，亦不愧爲一個革命建國的幹部。</p>
<p>大家要知道，進年來我們中國一般學校教育的失敗，既是失敗在不注重生活的訓練，一般教職員學生，把生活的秩序和行動的紀律都看得無關重要，以爲學生祗要學科分數及格就行了，而其對於青年學生的生活行動與品性的優劣高下，以為無關宏旨的，殊不知正因爲這個緣故，就斷送了我們青年一生事業的前途，且斷喪了我們民族無窮的生命，所以我們以後要建國，首先就要確立建國的基礎，尤其先要建立我們全國知識青年的基業。青年有了健全的基業，纔有民族的生命，青年的基業是什麽，就是他有秩序的生活﹑習慣和有組織的一致行動，換言之，亦就是現代國民所必需的公共道德，人人所應遵守的社會秩序和團體的紀律，必須如此，使每一個國民都能知道尊重社會的秩序和團體的紀律，都能自動﹑自治﹑互助﹑合作﹑自立﹑自強，公而忘私，然後纔能達到我們建立現代國家獨立平等的目的，軍事訓練之可貴，就是在此，因爲軍隊除了軍事學問技術之外，最重要的就是團體生活的養成，而團體生活之中特別注重於紀律和秩序，大家要知道，生活的秩序和行動的紀律，可說是我們每個人成功立業的基本條件，不僅在軍隊裏面要時刻注意，就是將來退伍以後，無論去到社會或學校以及農工經濟鄉鎮保甲各階層，都要保持這種生活的特點，重秩序，守紀律，自動，自治，自立，自強，然後纔能作一般民眾的模範，而發揮以一當十，以一當百的領導作用。（未完明日續）</p>
<h3>美軍駐華司令部　六月底暫不撤銷　吉倫稱範圍盡可能縮小</h3>
<p>〔中央社本報訊〕美軍駐華總司令吉倫中將，日昨接見中央社記者稱：（一）美軍駐華司令部在本年六月底並不撤銷，但其範圍盡可能縮小，并隨環境而變遷。在最近期間，美軍司令部將無大變動，在一九四六年下半年，美軍司令部人員將在四千人左右。又稱：美陸軍部現已開始　備將留華工作美軍之家屬運華，第一批可在本年九月到達，人數多少尚未統計，渠等將自携各種家具及日用品俱來，蓋上海物價過昂，美軍不能負擔，美軍家眷抵華後之居住問題，及兒童教育問題，均由美軍當局詳細計劃中。（二）記者復詢以日僑之撤遣工作進行情況，吉倫將軍答稱：在華北之日僑已全部撤退，尚有極少數仍在華北者，亦將於日內被送回國。至於東九省之日僑撤退工作，方於最近開始，同時尚無若何統計，加以東北方面之不安定局障礙於影響。故每月東北日僑被遣扯之數目，均屬（不肯定）的統計。（三）對於某方報紙抨擊美機協助國軍之事，吉倫將軍前已予以否認，今復重申美軍在華之任務稱：美軍已奉命絕對禁止參與任何一方面之戰爭，更避免涉及國共雙方之糾紛，以致助長戰事，最後吉倫將軍稱：美軍在華之政策，以美政府爲依歸，渠本人無權發表表任何意見。至若中國戰事，仍繼續進行，美方政策是否改變，則渠不便有何表示。</p>

<h3>一代巨奸難逃國法　陳逆公博在蘇槍決　臨刑前分與陳褚兩逆握別</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州三日電〕偽國民政府代理主席陳逆公博，三日晨在第三監獄執行死刑、上午七時卅分，蘇高檢處派檢察官李曙東，偕書記官王學　率蘇警長等法警七名，乘汽車一輛，於八時駛抵獅十口第三監獄，設臨時法庭於獄內空室，由陳典獄長松年派看守主任華瑞庭率　守警四名至　字第一號囚室，將最高法院之覆判裁定　送達陳逆，並命於正本上捺印指紋時。陳逆早餐甫畢，適為　看守主任書寫對聯，恰寫至下聯明月二字，待其忽忽書竣，始提入臨時法庭，時陳逆猶未知執行在　，故身穿短服，為灰色黑條毛質夾短衫褲，脚穿灰色綫　，黑色織貢呢單鞋，見法庭內法警林立，檢察官端坐於公案之後，始知死在眼前，惟態度仍極鎭定，以毫不在意之語氣云：「我懂了，今天執行吧，讓我回去穿以長衫，比較好看一些。」遂即返身回監室，將衣袋中表錢筆等零物置牀舖上，換穿黑色新綫襪暨半新黑色半統尖頭皮鞋，並罩上靑藍士林布長衫，從容與隔鄰之褚逆民誼握手，彼此互道再見，並至女監晤陳逆璧君，亦握手告知死別，末囑陳逆謂，日用漱口玻璃杯一只，必須附葬，叮　畢，即復入臨時法庭，以雙手撑住公案桌沿，上身半俯以靜聆最後之鞫訊。李檢察官訊問年籍後，繼訊以有無遺言，可代轉致家屬，陳逆答稱：「並不知家屬究在何處，沒有什慶遺言。」李檢察官復指旁側小桌謂，如有文件留點，可以坐下書寫，陳逆答稱：「有致蔣主席之陳情書一件，已書就三分之一，惟欲續成，需耗三小時，為我一人而使諸公長久坐待，心不自安，况現在似已無此必要。」遂含笑與李檢察官，王書記官一一握手遭：「再見」，時法警欲發綁，陳逆笑請免綁，謂：「不必如此，讓我體面一點。」並以手指拍執槍站身側之法警局宏範謂：「你是執行官吧，請乾脆一點，不要使我面部過份難看。」語舉，大踏步向監獄後部之荒菜　刑塲走去，面北背南，直立刑塲正中。李檢察官，王書記官，陳典獄長均蒞塲監視，八時卅分論令行刑，陳逆聞言閉目，頭部微向側仰，執行警周宏範站於離陳逆兩尺餘之地點，發一槍，即命中後腦，從右頰射出，陳逆應聲下挫，先臀部着地，向後仰倒，至此一代禍國之巨奸，受國法之制裁而殞命矣。茲錄其遺物於後：手提公事包一隻，寒暑表一隻，火酒盆一隻，手提皮包一隻，木梳一把，修面刀一把，黃白絨毛巾毯包衣袱一個，鬍刷盆一雙，書一包，白單被包褥　一個，面盆二隻，小剪刀二把，熱水瓶二個，指甲刀一把，其他什物一包及現鈔數萬元。記者復閱悉其覆判書，共有三份，一係批答李麗莊者，其二乃係批答住居上海之趙約翰及劉天佑者，茲分別另錄於後，至趙劉二人與陳逆之關係，迄今尙屬謎題，陳逆遺屍暫停監獄檢騐室，現已由監獄通知其住居十粹街六十五號之傭僕劉同忱，飭轉知陳逆家屬來蘇收殮。</p>

<p>右被告因漢奸案件，經江蘇商等法院於中華民國卅五年四月十二日判決後，送請覆判，聲請人亦聲請覆判，本院判決如左：</p>
<p>主文</p>
<p>原判決核准</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本件原判決認定事實，為被告陳公博原係中國國民黨黨員，為汪逆兆銘之心腹，迭在中樞充任要職。民國廿六年中日戰事發生，敵勢被猖，淞滬旋告不守，震撼首都，國民政府決定長期抗戰，西遷重慶，策劃反攻。詛汪逆兆銘竟違反旣定國策，甘受日酋近衛文　之利用，秘密言和，被告迫隨汪逆參與謀議，於二十七年底應汪之召，自成都前往越南河內，續商和平運動，由汪逆草擬主和　電，交被告及周佛海等　至香港發表，以響應近衛主張之和平三原則，冀圖淆感聽聞，劍撓中央抗戰計劃。旋汪逆轉赴上海，與日寇商訂和平基礎方案，樹立偽政權，而被告則奔走於港滬之間，始終參與其事，迨礎商已獲妥協，即於二十九年三月卅日共同組織偽國民政府於南京，汪逆自任偽主席，被告則任偽立法院院長，並於同年五月，以偽專使名義率領使節團赴日答禮，嗣又兼任偽上海市市長，於日寇卵翼之下，公然正式簽訂中日基本條約，同時發表中日滿共同宣言，承認滿洲國，以破壞我國領土之完整。又於太平洋戰事爆發後，附和日寇，於卅二年一月允日以偽國民政府名義，對我盟邦英美宣戰，並與日寇締結同盟條約，嗣復以偽大使名義東渡訪日，翌年三月，汪逆赴日就醫，被告代行偽國民政府主席及偽軍事委員會委員長職務，從此偽政府軍政大權由其獨攬。至汪逆死後，即正式代理偽主席，兼任偽行政院院長，並以偽元首資格，赴日拜見敵皇，表示仍本汪逆遺志，與日寇同生共死，以完成大東亞戰爭之任務，因日寇投降，畏罪潛逃，匿居日本，經電令拘送回國，解院起訴等情。其所憑之證據，為被告與汪逆兆銘共同組織偽國民政府，歷充各重要偽職，並於汪逆死後繼其首魁地位，總攬偽政楷，竊據南京，擅發號令各情，已據自白不諱，並有名義主持會議及處理　務之記載，偽上海市公報內，被告以偽市長　　發布之公文　另案查獲被告以偽國民政府代理主席名義，任用褚民誼為偽廣東省長，偽廣州綏靖主任等職之任命狀，可資證明。該被告對於汪逆在離　前如何告以與日寇秘密　和之圖謀，邀其　赴越南河內，拍發主和　電以為敵酋近衛文　和平聲明之策　，如何經汪逆召赴上海與日寇商訂基本關係條約，又於偽政府成立後，以偽專使名議赴日答　，旋發表「中日滿共同宣言」，公然承認「滿洲國」，以及如何於太平洋戰事發生後以偽國民政府名義對英美宣戰，並簽訌中日同盟條約，一再東渡，拜見敵酋，聲明誓與同生共死各事實，其自白書及在原院供述亦皆言之歷歷，參以偽宣傳部編印之「偽國民政府使節團赴日答禮記」·「陳公博赴日答禮言論集」·「中日締約與大東亞戰爭」，政治月刋社出版之「偽國民政府政綱之理論與實施」等書及「偽上海市公報」·「國外新聞貼報簿」各冊之記載，均屬相符，則被告與汪逆共同勾結日寇，秘密言和，樹立稱政權，公然背叛中央，逆跡至為昭著，並以被告抗辯雖（一）謂黨不可分，國必統一，故對汪逆離渝及組織偽政府均不贊成，屢經勸阻無效，祇以關係過深，未忍遽然離去，（二）謂對於中日基本關係條約，始終表示反對，一再要求已獲廢止，並向日寇父涉取銷「滿洲國」，（三）謂與晶寇言和係求全面和平之實現，故對於重慶政府從無敵對行為，至偽政府雖對英美宣戰，但未實行出兵，其目的僅在避免日寇搜括物資，（四）謂淪陷區人民創鉅痛深，偽立法院公報內，被告以偽院長經偽政府予以搶救，國家元氣賴</p>

<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕偽南京地方維持會長陶錫三（保　）漢奸一案，三日下午二時首都高院宣布判處被告有期徒刑二年，褫奪公　三年，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。陶逆已近風燭殘年，然聞判後仍聲稱不服，申請覆判。以保存不少，（五）謂日寇投降後曾維持南京治安，以待國軍接收，嗣後赴日待命，並非潛逃，但　關於第一點，汪逆勾結日寇，背叛中樞，果如被告所云，力經勸陰無效，此時即應權衡輕重，以決去就，乃被告竟應汪逆之召，潛赴河內，代發主和豔電，旋又共同組織偽國民政府於南京，分任要職。汪逆旣歿，復繼其職位，而居省魁，並在偽滿成立十三週年紀念日，廣播聲明繼承汪逆遺志，與日滿緊密携手，以期共存共榮，此項廣播演詞有敵國電機唱片可證，足見被告去順效逆，徇情昧義，不惜犧牲一切，而為喪權辱國之舉。其對汪逆一人，雖已盡其忠忱，而於國家民族，則貽害匪淺，且被告託庇日寇，竊據東南，固已形成割裂之局面，又組織偽國民黨，召開六全大會，藉資號召，所謂黨不可分，國必統一，顯屬　相矛盾。關於第二點，按中日基本關係條約規定，日本有權在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國領海內屯駐艦隊，以及實行經濟提携，任日寇侵害主權，搜括物資，即被告亦自知為不平等之苛約，乃竟附和汪逆，由其主管之偽立法院予以通過，將使我國受其束縛，永淪為日寇之附庸，犧牲國家民族，在所不惜，縱使事前表示反對，事後要求慶止，亦不能以此諉卸責任。而况該基本條約雖廠，繼又續訂中日同盟條約，與敵國結為盟邦關係，愈臻密切，致與中央抗戰國策背道而馳，利害更屬相反。又查被告初則與汪逆發表中日滿共同宣言，嗣又於三十四年二月二十六日廣播慶祝偽滿成立十三週年之紀念，始終承認滿洲國之存在，其影響所及，實足破壞我國領土之完整，茲猶斤斤辯稱，曾向日寇交涉取消滿洲國，其孰能信。關於第三點，查被告附和汪逆與日寇媾和，遠反我抗戰國策，且又背叛中樞，另組偽府，並在偽中央政治會議中決議「國府還都後，重慶方面對內對外各種政令及條約·協定·契約等一槪無效，所有軍隊應即停戰待命，所有公務員應於最近期間來京報到」，此有「偽國民政府政綱之理論與實施」書內之記載可稽，該決議案旣妄稱「國府還都」，而又否認重慶政府之存在，其欲消滅中央政權，企國取而代之，昭然若揭。所謂對重慶政府從無有敵對行為，已不攻自破。又按我國旣定方針，係聯合英美民主陣綫，以抵抗德日軸心，而被告與汪逆竟樹立偽政權與敵國日本携手，悍然對我英美盟邦宣戰，其月的在依附軸心，摧毀英美，使我中央抗戰陷於孤立，以遂其叛國之企圖，極為明顯。所謂以此抵制日本搜括物資，亦係掩飾之詞。關於第四點，按日寇對於淪陷區因無力控制，始製造傀儡政府，供其利用，藉以建其以華制華，以戰養戰之目的，被告與汪逆組織偽政府後，奉承日寇意旨，在淪陷區所施之稗政，如搜括物資，濫發偽幣，公賣鴉片，奴化靑年，淸鄕封鎖等項，殆無一而非禍國殃民之舉，此就原院所調取偽上海市政府之卷及在另案搜獲被告與褚民誼來往之電報，可見一斑。以上諸端，均係出自日寇政治侵略之毒計，其貽害之深，足以亡國滅種而有餘，被告尙謂搶救人民，保存元氣，實屬適得其反。關於第五點，按偽政府旣係傀儡機構，於日寇投降後，即失其憑藉，勢必同時解體，當時日本降將岡村寗次等在南京息戈候命，於國軍未到達前，對於地方秩序仍應遵守受降命令，負責維持原無須被告再予協助，况被告僅有少數殘餘兵力留駐南京，更無足輕重，縱使曾飭部屬與敵軍共維治安，亦係於途窮之中，不得不俯首就範，何能以此冀邀宥恕。再被告果係誠心待罪，則不問環境如何，亦應在京候命，乃竟急遽避往日本，其非畏罪潛逃而何，因而斷定上述種種抗辯無非飾詞，希圖减免罪責，均屬無可　取，按　　　，　則並　違背　聲　　　　旨，除仍請被告原主黨不可分，國必統一。其追隨汪逆乃由於道　情感之不能　絕，而擁護黨國，擁護且有民成國家統一之　種措施可表，因以指　原審未就此等事項　其　查能　為不需外，並謂原審指定之公設辯護人，未能於審判期日前　見被告，充分準　，以發其攻擊防禦之能事，暨原審未無　用酌　及自首等規定，　竟判以極刑，亦均為其不能首服之點云云，要知，被告在事實上旣已追隨汪逆與敵言和，以與中央旣定之抗戰國策背道而馳，且復托庇於敵寇卵　之下，共同更組偽黨，另樹政權，以與我中央對抗，即已顯然其備通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之故意與行為，犯罪即已成立，縱令同時確有其他與其所實施者逈然不同之心意或相異之見解，亦與其犯非之成立絕不相關，且就被告犯罪之手段與犯罪所生之危害而論，情節旣極至大，亦不能以有一二協助抗戰之措施，即謂堪予末減，對於此等抗辯有關之事項，自無再加調查之必要。而被告旣非於犯罪未發覺　自動投案而受審判，原與刑法及漢奸自首條例中關於自首之規定不符，固不得指摘原判決未　　用此項規定為不當，即原審指　之公設辯護人商溶，縱令未於　判期日前接見被告，但旣於審判期日到庭辯護，亦不足　　　　　　之　　　　　何不　，是則聲　覆判意旨亦屬毫無可取。原判決本於　定之事　　定被告係共犯通謀敵國，　　反抗本　之罪，並以日竊以以　併我國為其陰謀，自九一八後，　踞我東北四省，成立稱滿帝國，族又出兵內蒙，進　平　，演成七七事實，我國忍無　忍，為求民族之生存，起而抗戰，舉國上下一致共赴國難，以爭取最後勝利，被告原為中樞要員，自應深明斯旨，詎因戰爭初期我軍稍挫，意旨　為動搖，途附和汪逆，甘受日寇利用，於　勢逆轉，一髪千鈞之際，竟秘密出走，發電主和，繼而組偽府，背叛中央，並與日寇締結同盟，悍然對我英美盟邦宣戰，一再破壞抗戰國策，助長日寇侵略，將使國家民族陷於萬刦不復之境地，實屬昧於大發，甘作罪魁，於法無可矜全，爰依懲治漢奸條例第一條，刑事法第二條第一項，第二十八條，懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款，刑法第三十七條第一項，懲治漢奸條例第八條第一項，第九條，處以死刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收，論罪科刑，均無不當，應即予以核准。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第二十條第一項第一款，判決如主文，最高法院刑事第二庭審判長張于潯，殷白序，林尙濱，羅人驥，陳士誠，書記官李邦鳳，中華民國卅五年五月十六日。　　　　　　，　　　　，　　及海塘　救委會總工程師馮且均受傷，本報記者亦受微傷·</p>

<h3>嚴重兇險的對外貿易！</h3>
<p>昨日本報消息，自勝利後，歐美航商紛紛復業，大批船舶銜尾而來，而本市物價較各國高昂，輸出因之减少，大部份外輪均空船返國。這是一幅意義多麼深長的圖畫！這是足以召致民族衰亡的沉疴！所以致此者，原非可以獨責上海市民，而上海人却坐視這險象，不起來喊一聲痛！依然優游笑樂，眞是奇絕怪絕。八九月來，海外航運雖尙未恢復舊觀，但供一般民用的商品，却已源源舶來。今日上海市面上充斥洋貨，棉麥無論矣，即以橘子汽水糖果香烟之微甚至兒童吹玩的肥皂泡，亦都仰給國外，而我們的輸出幾等於零，竟使外輪空船返國。說句笑話，由今之道，再不變革，那我們吃的穿的住的用的，都將成為「美式配備」，只有輸入而沒有輸出，那裏會有貿易平衡？而在國際收支平衡方面，僑匯敎會及遊歷收人銳减，使我們在國際收支方面也處於絕對不利的地位。長此演展下去，我們民族的經濟生命，必將患貧血而枯竭以死。當局對於這種嚴重的病症，如果還沒有看見，這是不智；假使已經看見而不圖迅速挽救，那是不仁！</p>
<p>造成這種嚴重病象的，其原因雖不單純，治本之方，也許要努力求政治上之安定；然而目前這種奄奄待斃的貧血病，次不能再等待政治問題收拖延不次，必得先趕快在經濟的領域內，作必要的適當措施。經濟部新任部長王雲五氏，來自民間，應知民生疾苦；自營企業，應知工業危機。上台以後，對此兇險的病症究竟用什麼藥石？這是我們所急欲知道的。</p>
<p>照我們看法，病已垂危，趕快施救或來得及。就積極方面言，對輸人商品，政府應即嚴加管制。因為照目前一般情形，國外物價均比我國為低，故縱使調整關稅，亦無濟於事。譬如某種商品輸人，加上了運費乃至値百抽百或二百的進口稅，還較在國內生產者為價廉。値百抽百乃至二百的進口稅已是關稅政策的運用，但仍未必能達到取締進口的目的。即使不給外匯，商人仍可用美鈔定購，故外匯的核給亦不能限制輸入。為今之計，進口貿易似應採行領照制度。若干商品如不必要其進口，或人民即不消費亦無妨其生存者，就應禁止輸入，可由政府規定每月或每年最高進口額，不得自由輸入。至必要商品亦應依照性質，嚴定輸人限額，由政府就限額內頒發執照始准輸入。目下我國對外貿易的逆轉，多由於政府對輸入貿易幾乎純採放任主義，至多亦僅憑些微關稅政策的運用。而美鈔在我國市塲流通，更足破壞我們的外匯核給辦法。這種放任政策若讓它持續下去，必使我們民族破產。我們要趕快採取輸人管制及限額憑照政策，同時絕對禁止市塲使用美鈔，藉以加强外匯的管制，庶幾可以挽救目前這稱頹勢。</p>
<p>就積極方面說，我們要趕快鼓勵出口，我們的絲茶桐油鎢鋅猪鬃都為主要出口商品，其中若絲若猪鬃等，現在國外均有替代品，其生產價格均較我國土產為廉。我對外出口貿易的不振，主要原因就在我國商品生產成本過高，不能在國際市傷與人競爭。譬如農家育蠶賣繭，抵不來桑葉及人工的成本，而繅絲出售則更抵不來繭的成本，長此下去，不但工業破產，農業亦將破產。何况交通迄未暢復，物資不能流通，更使物價昂騰，出口停滯。國內外物價相差如是，政府對於出口貿易，如果還不考慮外匯率的重訂，或採取津貼政策，我們敢說外輪將始終是空船返國的。話又說回來，一年半載，只見洋貨進口，不見土產出洋，則終有一天縱然洋貨輸入也將沒有主顧再來購買，因為大家的血差不多抽完了！</p>
<p>總之，政府如還有經濟政策的話，就該從這裏大處落墨，一面趕快用領照和限額的辦法，嚴格管制進口貨，一面改訂外匯率，或津貼出口商的損失，使出口土產亦能以低廉價格在海外市塲競銷。必須使我國業已萎縮了八年的出口貿易，由恢復而繁榮起來，纔可免於經濟亡國的末路！否則中國不但無希望做一個工業國，抑且連做一個附屬的農業國都不够資格，何等嚴重，何等兇險！</p>

<h3>對弗朗哥政府絕交之建議　各國代表反響良好　安理會定後日開會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：安全理事會小組委員會在調查弗朗哥政權報告中宣稱：該會在法律上無權對可能發動侵路者採取行動，美國政府對此表示不滿，美國務院在審查該項報告後，或將就各國與西班牙絕交一點，加以修正，　絕交一舉或將引起西國人民對外國干涉行為之反感也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕聯合國西班牙問題調查委員會提議弗朗哥政府若不於九月以前引退，則全世界即與絕交，聯合國安全理事會各代表今日對此均表示良好反　，但調查委員會某某數項建議，顧將遭遇不同程度之反對。理事會定於六日聞會討論。五部份代表承認委員會提議由聯合國大會發動對弗朗哥絕交一事，實堪驚異，蓋此乃理事會迭次猶豫不敢為者也。將來是否有何强大反抗，足使委員會此項建議發生重大變更，一時尙難確定。此項報告書已獲得調查委員會中·法。阿根廷·渡蘭及巴西五國贊助，則理事會中其他六代表中之任何一人，如欲集合充分票數以作重大變更，亦殊困難。巴西代表伐勒索對於此項提案，雖置身事外，但相信不致有何重大變更。美代表團發言人亦同樣見解，關鍵乃在蘇聯之態度。蘇代表葛羅米柯尙未立即有何反響，但各代表預料其將根據以前立塲反對報告中若干點，最有反對可能之各點，即：（一）安全理事會無權指導與西班牙絕交，因西班牙政府僅視為可能的而非實際的國際和平之威脅；（二）以本案空聯合國大會處理。依照聯合國憲軍，此項報告書之通過須獲若干必要票數，包括中·美·英。法·蘇五常任理事國在內，蘇聯若投反對票，調查委員會之建議即歸無效。但葛羅米柯或當採取該委員會四月二十九日成立時同樣之態度，以放棄投票表示反對。建議中有一項可望一致通過而無反對者，即理事會贊同三月四日英美法聯合宣言，號召西理牙人民用和平方式推翻弗朗哥政府，設立臨時政府以待自由選舉。</p>
<p>報告書中之結論及建議</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕聯合國安理會西班牙問題調查委員會之報告書，其結論及建議錄後：</p>
<p>（一）（甲）弗朗哥政權之行動，雖依照憲章第卅九欵解釋，目前並未構成對和平之威脅，致安理會無　下令或授權執行憲章第四十或四十二欵所規定步驟，唯此等行動確已　成一情勢，實為國際和平與安全之　在威脅，是故依照憲章卅四欵之解釋，此種情勢頗有危及國際和平與安全之可能；（乙）職是之故，按照第卅六欵第一條規定，安理會有權建議適合之應付程序或方法，藉以改善甲項所述情勢。</p>
<p>（二）最後之問題，乃小組委員會究應向安理會建議採取若何步驟。小組委會經週密考慮，應採行何種有效及適宜之步驟，藉以應付此一特殊事件，並思及聯合國全體大會根據憲章第十款所保有之重要權力，議提出建議如下：（甲）安理會應支持一九四六年三月四日聯合五國，美國，及法國宣言所列舉之原則。（乙）安理會應以本小組委員會所提證據及報告暨下述建議轉呈聯合國全體大會，此項建議乃茍非全體大會時取消佛朗　政權，及實現宣　所述政治自由，認為滿意，全體大會應通過　決案，建議聯合國每一會員國，立即與佛朗哥政權斷絕外交關係。（丙）聯合國秘書長應採取適當步驟，以此等建議通知所有聯合國會員國及其他有關國家。</p>
<p>（三）倘全體大會認為一九四六年三月四日宣言所定各項條件，業已全部實現，包括取消佛朗哥政權，宣佈政治大赦，令流亡西班牙人民返國，開放政治集會結社自由，實行自由公開選舉等，小組委員會提議，大會於一自由選舉之西班牙政府申請加入聯合國為，應予以善意之考　。</p>

<h3>李澤案重開辯論庭傳訊兩證人　庭諭定八日宣判　舒月橋要求將被告全部財產充公　檢察官謂檢舉動機若何與案無關</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞轟動全滬之新新公司總經理李澤漢奸嫌疑案，早經高院特刑庭劉庭長毓桂審理終結，定於上月七日宣判。嗣以李澤所供涉及「商統會」案件，高巡幸認爲有調查之必要，乃依刑事訴訟法二八四條之規定，於昨日再開辯論庭。被告方面傳到證人蔡自我，穆雲波，說舒月橋平日行爲不端，敲詐未遂，乃惡意宣傳，更進檢舉之。舒則絕對否認，謂彼等憑空揑造，信口開河。另一檢舉人韓武城稱：「我們全體同人可用性命來保證舒月橋的爲人，他的檢舉李澤，完全全出於正義感」。而舒月橋更要求鞀李澤全部財產充公，佈施於貧苦之同胞。經被告所延章士劍，陳雲銳二律師再度辯論後，庭諭本月八日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>昨日下行三時十分，法誕中已擠滿旁者，其中以新新公司職工與李澤之家屬親友爲最多，李澤即於此時被法警帶入公堂。李穿深灰色綢質長衫，下擺露出白色袜子，足登深黃色皮鞋，反背着手。待其立入被告欄中後，劉庭長即宣布再事審部之原因，並命書記官宣讀上次庭訊筆錄。舒月橋等均稱無誤，李澤則更正二點：（一）聞蘭亭繼唐壽民接辦「商統會」，時在三十三年八月；（二）「商統會」收買之棉紗布二萬餘件，日人僅拿去六十餘件，乃傳訊證人蔡自我，蔡爲廣東中山人，五十歲，爲李澤之近親表史弟，住勞合路，據稱不知門牌號碼。又稱，前在新新公司公安部任職，現爲庶務部主任，不大與舒月橋見面，不過知道舒爲的是錢，最先需索金條十一根，李澤不答應，後來減爲七條，也不允，再減至三條，仍舊不肯給。法官問李澤，也說有此事。可是舒月橋却說：他們</p>
<p>憑空揑造信口開河　我檢舉澤奸，全憑人民正義。再問李澤，李稱：舒平日行爲，常有不檢，後介紹至新都飯店，亦如此。屢勸不改，甚至在大庭廣衆之中，肆行溫罵，煽動罷工，乃報警驅之。經人說情，寫悔過書，拿了七萬元始行去職。後又請其李姓鄰居，要求復職未遂，乃在外惡意破壞宣傳，甚至報諸老閘分局。嗣傳另一證人穆雲波，天津人，卅八歲，據稱與舒月橋感情甚好，</p>
<p>曾爲此於去年十月十八日下午二時調解，舒約他於十九日在外個別談話，自謂跑金子單幫虧了本，要和李澤「碰」一「碰」。遂提三項要求：（一）給他</p>
<p>二根金條償還損失　（二）代他找職業；（三）薪水不够，補給生活費。但舒月橋說，十月十八日他在寗波，所謂談話係屬虛構。事實上，彼此次檢舉，曾爲李澤用卑鄙無恥之手段，藉圖平事。去年十月五日，即曾爲此去其家商談，而爲彼所拒云。另一檢舉人韓武城則稱，蔡自我爲李澤近親，穆雲波前爲李澤之保鏢，曾將解赴欵在六國飯店賭掉，未爲李澤所責斥，此次感恩圖報，自爲情理之所必然，但彼等之徧袒，實不爲法律所許允。言次，即大發高論，說違叛國策者，即爲漢奸，如南宋之秦橧，明末之吳三桂，喪心病狂，通謀敵國，爲人民法律所不許。李澤旣此中人，故依法檢舉，應請懲治，以維忠孝，使五千年來之</p>
<p>民許精神不致淪亡云云。至此李澤參加「商統會」第一，二屆聯席會議事，有會議記錄作證。李澤供稱，我不曾每次參加，根本沒有提議，也沒有發言。並稱，被告自民國七年辦事至今已二十餘年，絕未投機取巧，爲害人民。至今拘禁已五月，損失難以數計，故請早日判決。劉庭長乃宣告開辯論。戴勞鐸檢察官駁斥被告不做事之說，謂旣參加理事會，通過決議，即爲敵僞工作，而檢舉漢奸之動機若何，與本案無關。嗣由被告所延陳霆銳章士釗二律師爲被告辯護，強調漢奸之確定，應視其行爲右何；李澤不過借「商統會」僞職之名爲掩護，一心爲中央工作，自不能以漢奸論斷。辯論終結後，又有「檢舉李澤漢奸後援會」代表甘田到庭，表白意見，李澤身爲僞商統會理事，爲經濟大漢奸，應請嚴辦云。</p>
<h3>參議員選舉訟案　昨開審二起</h3>
<p>第五區原告自願撤回</p>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞本市市參議員選舉訟案，地院昨晨又開審二起：（一）第五區市參議員岑子良爲該區市民朱瑛控告，因岑之資格成問題，故請求確認無效。昨晨審理時，朱瑛自願撤回原訴，故未審理。（二）招商局總務處長曹省之訴請確認當選第三名候補參議員有效案，業經審訊一過，已誌訟代理人黃人達律師出庭，被告則由法定代理人之代表，該區副區長夏明　及民政處第三科長李學訓到庭，未延律師。夏稱該區領得選票三萬六千張，發出二萬三千零九十四張，開箱得票二萬二千六百五十張，廢票四百五十二張，其中有白票四十八張，監先投票，絕對公正。李稱：祇要假選　人合法，任何人當先無不可。嗣傳證人陳鴻生，陳因代曹在選塲任記錄，知曹共得選票一六一一張廢票三十六。黃律師稱：上次庭上檢出之廢票十五張，實不能視作廢票，而白票數目較少，顯見有被調換者云，庭論六月八日上午九時宣判。</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞因支用糧貸不當，涉嫌被逮之糧商，各方迭有報道，惟頗有出入。茲據本報記者探悉：除三泰米行吳蓉生已遭扣押外，其他尚有長江公司王巽之，及該公司職員二人。此外各糧貸米行之負責人，均隨傳隨到。故除非獲有想當罪嫌佐證，並不隨時扣押。至五昌米行樂永明之被扣，則因有抬價罪嫌，與糧貸案無關。</p>
<p>雙訊：接受糧貸審核委員會委託調查糧貸帳目之公信會計師事務所，昨已中止查帳工作。據悉：該所主持人奚王書氏，在該所接受委託調查時，適在杭州。茲奚氏返滬後，以自身亦屬審核委會委員之一，對執行調查糧貸工作，似有未便，故臨時中止。</p>
<p>本市米價經當局雷厲風行取締投機後，連日確已下跌，惟米市塲交易已由有關機關派員監視，米商不敢以身試法，惟各米號門市售價殊不一律，當局業加注意，如遇有米店售價逾越規定百分之六利潤者，決予嚴辦，市民並得隨時檢舉。關於米商存米登記事，市府已定今日截止，一般米商監於當局言出必隨，昨紛向公會補辦登記者，頗爲踴躍。據聞市政當局將　據登記數量派員密查，如發現有陷　　米者，除將其存米悉數充公外，並依法嚴懲。</p>

<h3>挽救工業唯一途徑　勞資必須通力合作　朱學範提議創設合作工廠　各工會座談會上熱烈討論</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞本市總工會整理委員會，昨日下午二時半假座該會南市蓬萊路大禮堂，舉行挽救民族工業危機座談會。出席有該會領導人朱學範，周學湘，水祥雲，及各業工會負責人等二百餘人，首由朱學範闡述召集開會之動機稱：目前本市工業已面臨危機，工人爲生產之主要部門，故與之有密切關係，勝利後工人之希望建設，要生產，要做工，要吃飯，但目前之工業家，已開廠者感覺難以維持，未開者感覺前途黯淡，不敢貿然嘗試。而工人之在業者生活不能安定，失業者則要求工作。總工會職責所在，故召集各工會負責人商討，希謀獲得解決途徑。朱氏繼將谷部長吳市長所述關於處理勞資糾紛之方針重述一遍後稱：在此嚴重關頭，工人無一願工廠關門而致失業，祇願其日趨繁榮有工可做。但目前之危機，誠如絲織業同業公會負責人所言，其主要原因爲　外匯太低，官僚資本作崇，利息太高，交通不便，國內政局不安，工潮迭起等，我們工人對於以上各點，除工潮應負責任外，其他各點皆無能爲務，當此工業危機嚴重之時，工人應坦白糾正本身過失，在谷部長指示下，負起工人應負之責任，不再任意罷工怠工，整飭紀律，增進生產，促進勞資合作，不但要勞資合作，政府亦應負起責任，由政府勞資三方面之合作，以挽救　此危機。止今之世界局勢，除合作兩安外，別無他途。勞資不但要精神合作，更需進一步至經濟合作，故本人提議創設合作工廠，以合作方式，將停頓之機器開動，將糜廢之勞力利用，蓋目前欲抑平物價，增加生產爲最主要之一環。故欲解決目前之工業危機，本人之意見即需政府勞資三方面之合作。</p>
<p>討論兩題熱烈發言　繼之在主席周學湘主持下，展開討論。主題爲（一）民族工業危機的原因，（二）如何挽救民族工業危機：又分促進勞資合作與挽救民族工業兩點。各工會代表熱烈發言，紛紛指出當前危機之主要原因，即在政治不上軋道，內戰之尚未停止，交通阻梗，一切未能恢復常態，遂致影響生產效率。其他如外貨傾銷，官僚資本之壟斷，生產工具與技術之落後，勞工智識水凖之低落，貸款利息之高，工廠管理之不當等，亦爲造成工業危機之原因。此時朱學範氏起立稱：希冀各發言人對於目前工業危機之　結應純粹站在公正立塲，以客觀之態度加以討論。在勞方本身亦應坦白接受批評，承認過去之錯誤，加以糾正，表現新中國工人應有之態度，　行勞資澈底合作。昨日各工會代表之熱烈發言，與乎認識之正確等，較前大有進步，最後由水祥雲歸納各人意見，作一結論：</p>

<h3>解決失業問題　谷部長講合作制度</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞社會部長谷正綱氏，此次來滬，對工商界勞資雙方指示頗多。谷氏並於二日晚在合作電台播講「解決當前失業問題的一個方法，」主張建立合作工廠制度。谷氏稱：此一新型之企業形態，於總理所著實業計劃之第六計劃中，早有指示。</p>
<p>合作工廠可限制私人資本之擴展，並消滅勞資對立。資本不至日益集中，出力者亦得分享其應得之盈餘，勞動者不受資本之剝削，在生產過程中，同時解決了分配問題。合作工廠可實現資本社會化之目標。對社員所投資本，只給以法定利潤，其盈餘之一定成數，必須儲作公有基金。此項公積金社員所公有不可分割。如此合作工廠所有之資金，可漸由私有化爲公用。合作工廠可改善工人之日常生活，因其有消費合作社公益金與敎育基金之設立，使工人之物質與精神生活，皆能得合理之改善。合作工廠之進行程序，第一階段採用勞資合作制，第二階段轉化爲勞資合一制，終於工人自有其工廠。工人工資之支付，可採用實物分配制度，使工人生活得到確實保障，不受物價波動影響。原　之採購與出品之推銷，則可委託社會部全國合作社物品供銷處上海分社代爲辦理，其經營業務或採用單營制，或採用綜合經營制，其組織規模，每一單位至少需能容納一千人或二千人，其經營程序必須從原料比較容易收購。出品比較易出售者先行開辦，以保證事業之發展。今日我國之工業建設，應以合作制度爲重要基礎，爲求根本上解決工潮，爲救濟失業工人，主張創設合作工廠，將合作制度向工業中滲透。</p>
<h3>粽子菖蒲應佳節一年容易又端陽</h3>
<p>粽子，菖蒲，枇杷－又是端陽了·前幾天報上的廣吿，粽子每隻三百五十元，今天到南京路上一家有名的舖子去問一問，却每只要五百元了。</p>
<p>換句話說，一隻粽子的代價，差不多等於白米一升！</p>
<p>吳市長說，上海的米並不缺少，米貴，是因爲「鬼」。端午節是鍾進士斬鬼的時候，這些屯積居奇，操縱投機的「鬼」，是到了該「斬」的時候了。</p>
<p>節令，未始不是大家生活上的一種點綴，喝雄黃酒也好，門上掛菖蒲也好，唱白蛇傳時搬出「原子蛇」來也好，不過，在這全世界鬧亂荒的時候，少吃幾只粽子，救濟救濟正在搶樹皮吃的同胞豈不更好呢？</p>

<p>休息之後，華聯以張良雄替出李震中，南珍先中，松圓立刻回敎，相成演雄，雙管齊下，追成各卅平手，形勢漸見緊張，迨達雲妙中，卅比卅，客軍首次超出，戰局拉鋸，分數兎起　落，成各卅五，卅七，卅九平局。華聯震中重出，良雄下野，震中梅開二度，廣益遠中，四十六對四十，華聯再見抬頭。昆渝梁蘊明調出達雲，達雲再入，又成各四十六，廣益投中後，時間隨之完畢，華聯乃以四十八對四十六，二分之差，力取客軍。</p>

<h3>答復讀者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）孫鎭源問編者先生：家父早故，家母不識字余年幼，且在蘇州謀生，社會情形不懂，故此奉問，在抗戰前原居上海南市，「八一三」事變逃難入前法租界居住，次年南市市面好轉，難民紛紛遷返，然天房東云：「已被人佔去居住而登記過了」，家母就提出抗議；又去舊居查察，果被人佔居，並利用我家一切傢具什物應用，經各方探聽得知此人是敵寇密探的爪牙，祇得忍受吞聲，自抗戰勝利，天日重光，人民正可安居樂業，然已鳩佔鵲巢；故特叩詢（一）如何防止其再盜賣傢具？（二）何令其遷出並賠償已被盜賣之傢具？敬請詳為賜覆。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）傢具所有人應提出確切之證據，或證明方法，證明其所有權，而收回其所有物，或阻止他人擅行處分其所有物，如阻止無效，可請求法院排除侵害。（二）（甲）就該屋有合法之租賃權者，對於强佔居住之人，可請求其退出，或請求法院勒令遷出，如租賃關係業經中斷者，應先與出租人接洽回復之。（乙）已被盜賣之傢具，盜賣人應負賠償之責，事主應收集盜賣之證據，向盜賣人交涉，倘無效果，可向法院訴追。</p>
<p>（二）張育儒問　編輯先生：我有幾個疑問，請貴欄法律顧問指示：（一）政府保障二房東任意加租，刋於何條法律？（二）本宅二房東由黃而姓繆，在民國三十二年冬他們私相授受，可受法律拘束否？（三）我政府復員後上海市政府公佈取銷二房東資格及增加租金條例，抑專對大房東和二房東之間嗎？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）政府並無保障二房東任意加租之法律。（二）二房東將承租之房屋私相授受，不受法律拘束，如其授受未得出租人承諾者，則出租人得據以終止租賃。（三）（甲）査本市並無取銷二房東資格之法令。（乙）本市收取房屋租金標準，適用於一般出租人與承租人之間。</p>
<p>（三）江灣一讀者問　敝人向在江灣鎭小本營生，淪陷之初，本地大亨均變「新貴」，設「合作社」，挨戶勒捐，謂社員可享平價，雖見有肥皂洋燭火柴等日用品運來，但從未買到一次，勝利後「新貴」又變爲新人物，偶然問起前事，竟謂合作社員全體附逆無發言權，但社長理事等吞沒貨品，黑市賣出，大發其財，無人敢問，反而駡人附逆，心實不甘，未識被迫加人僞合作社爲社員，從未領到敵僞貨品者，是否爲附逆漢奸？有無罪名或發言之權？敵求賜敎。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕被迫加入僞合作社爲社員，而從未領取敵僞貨品者，不能認爲附逆漢奸，亦撫刑事罪名，至合作社社員，對於社務，依法應有發言權。</p>

<h3>「復業」「還本」傳說紛紜　公債兔起鶻落　頭寸奇緊環境不利　華洋股均不見佳妙</h3>
<p>昨日公債黑市，初因證交復業消息，統丙自六七〇〇元哄抬至七千元外，惟不久又因公債還本，有用關金之呼聲，多方紛來脫手，局勢頓吿鬆懈，近午盤跌至五五〇〇元而後稍穩，結果較上週六下跌九百元，收後復有喊低至五四〇〇元，後又喊高至五九〇〇元之說，華股與公債同趨疲途，上塲時亦因復拍空氣盛而稍漲，永紗漲至六〇七〇元，美亞四五五〇元，景福三一〇元，新光三〇〇元，勤興二三八元，入後銀行方面頭寸奇緊，日內有大批封存物資配出，銀根勢更抽緊，多方意興不佳，入後遂逐步萎靡，午收都現低價，結果較上週六永紗美亞勤興所跌尙微，新光景福各跌半成，冷門中小型復吿下游，午後喊價微高，外股初開尙穩，怡紗在一二四〇〇元盤旋，無如復業等消息抵不住現實環境不利，求供稍形飄忽，各股取捨不同，熱門怡紗稍回至上週六收市價左右，迨午後較之上週六各股升降不一。</p>
<h3>逢高即有吐售　人造絲價步小</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲一二〇天橋現貨，上午做價一百三十四五萬元，下午做價一百三十三萬元，較上週六短四五萬元，人造絲連朝疲軟，因價好即有人大量吐售，以致市價步步軟弱，廠經交易寂靜，價仍堅穩，昨日七十四五分勻度，洋行有交易，價做二百十萬元，干經杭州價小，申市昨亦减小四五萬元，網貨美亞被面比週六大一萬元，大誠格子璧縐先做四千三百三十元，最後做四千四百元。</p>
<h3>節關銀根緊迫　紗花布交易稀</h3>
<p>昨日紗市價疲交稀，復以今日端午節關係，進戶意存觀望，而一般迫於銀根者莫不貶低求脫，故四十二支藍鳳在瀉七八萬，二十支雙馬及中小型紗均降一二萬不等，市上僅南京帮略有進胃，人心平淡之至，午時紡建照例開紗，價較上期標低二三萬元之譜，惟八十支單牛頭綫，則此上週五所開價跌十萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>昨日紐的美棉電訊續昂六至十二磅音，許近期美金二八·一七，遠期二八·六九，米特林現貨二八·七七，本埠現棉市况堅挺，惟以端節期迫，廠商略存觀望，致交易欠佳，高級米特林送廠做十萬六千元，約昂一二千元云</p>
<p>布市因端節關係，客方採辦不若上日之旺，所以買者較少，坯布行情跌五百元，惟士林布因時令漸入吒季，市態帶穩，蜀贛晋閩漢津等處對於冬季貨物，另星採辦，仍不間斷。</p>
<h3>奢侈品　不許結外滙</h3>
<p>中央銀行鑒於最近數月以來，進口貨品，日見增多，尤以奢侈品數量至鉅，非僅影響我國工業之發展，且使資金外溢，爰經令飭中外各經營外匯銀行及錢莊，對於奢侈品，一律停止結匯，並由財部通令海關，絕對不准奢侈品類再行進口。</p>
<h3>楊津生將再度赴日　與麥帥商易貨問題　中韓商約即可簽訂</h3>
<p>日本戰後需要我國供給物資甚多，行政院曾派中央信託局易貨處副經理楊津生爲商務特派員，前往東京，與麥帥總部洽商，並籌辦在日之商務，結果極佳，楊氏返國後，即以食鹽，麥麩運日，即將是項價款購回桑苗，蠶種，枕木，煤礦器材及機器零件，達六萬餘噸，至日本需要之大豆等物，以東北局勢不安，無法運出，而華北淮蘆之鹽，亦以時局關係，運址不大，現日本請求向我方訂購食鹽八十萬噸，但我國目前以人工與燃料運輸等，僅擬以卅萬噸供日，楊特派員定本月底再赴日本視察，並會同我國駐日代表團經濟處長嚴恩棫氏，再向麥帥總部商討各種易貨事項，但我國常前能輸日之物資不多，由日運回之物，聞將爲新鮮乾繭，棉織物及工業器材等類，以應國內需要。</p>
<p>又訊，中韓商務我正力謀發展中。關於中韓間之貿易，將成立一商約，我駐韓軍事代表團團長邵毓麟氏，正向韓政府交涉中，中韓商約，即由邵氏負責代表簽訂。</p>
<h3>端節休業</h3>
<p>今日爲舊曆端午佳節，民問積習，均須插艾燃蒲，憑弔民族詩人，各業亦循例休業，各市塲均停止活動一天。</p>
<h3>米市到多銷少　行情續小一二千元</h3>
<p>今日米市消化仍呆，續見下挫一二千元，白元因端節關係，銷路較佳，形成立定之格，黃豆平疲，苞米客帮不動，下降千餘元，新蠶豆之各路貨湧到，價猛跌三四千元，麵粉回小六七百元，豆併賣氣甚濃，狂小七八百元，汕市本街去胃甚呆，下跌一二千元，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，計曰粳等七種，共一萬餘石，白粳三，七四九石，薄稻一，八一二石，早稻一，二〇二石，羊秈七三三石，社秈一〇九石，蕪秈二〇〇〇石，白元五八九石，</p>
<h3>米號要求增加利潤　考慮結果暫緩實行</h3>
<p>本市米業同業公會所屬全市各零售米號，於出售食米時，原規定每石收取利潤百分之六，惟近因物價高漲，開支浩大，同業要求增加利潤至百分之八，業經會員大會通過，即擬實行，後經該會鄭重考慮結果，決暫緩實行云。</p>
<h3>珍眉市價軋升</h3>
<p>津帮將搜羅綠花茶</p>
<p>專銷菲洲摩洛哥之珍眉及針眉等花色，刻下怡和洋行雖與貨方進行談判，惟賣買態度均極堅强，是以成議不多，惟市氣極佳，價格方面，珍眉一項，竟比上週軋升，針眉則呈堅穩之勢，至於各種內銷茶，本街店莊及客帮等地，雖有胃納，但在端節期中，吐納授受皆不感興趣，以故交易處於狹隘範圍內，據人津帮消息，俟節關過後，對於綠花茶，擬抱來者不拒之勢云。</p>
<h3>糧貨全部結束</h3>
<p>四聯總處消息，該處四月份舉辦之糧商貸款，因成績欠佳，已着放款銀行提前收回，現已全部結束，貸款各米商名次二三泰，吳蓉生·志豐·徐泰元·會豐·汪玉振·萬昌新，楊潤畬·通益公司·陸麟勛·恒泰豐·張超·復康，邵季高·永順泰，顧益生·乾錩餘，兪良濟·江北公司，邢頌文·協大亨，馮永聲·新昌，朱永明·協昌泰，祝世祿·通城公司，傅昌裕·長江企業公司，王巽之。以上共計十五家，每家糧貸六千萬元，總計九億元云</p>
<h3>烟煤略見帶高　白煤仍無起色</h3>
<p>煤市白煤各貨承前趨勢，實銷一時難有起色，行情疲途徘徊，烟煤屑在廠方競購中，實貨軋缺，市價繼續向榮，烟煤塊亦步其後塵，喊價疾升，終幸實銷有限，帶高尙微，柴炭爲節邊關係，市勢略疲，但零星小批發交易，價仍未肯廉也。</p>
<h3>中蠶提高繭價　上等十八萬　中等一萬</h3>
<p>中蠶公司在無錫·常州·嘉興·吳江等地所設之收繭處，以蠶繭品質之優劣，訂定價格標準，其價値聞品質最佳者，收價已提高至每担十八萬元，中等亦在十三萬左右。</p>
<p>江蘇蠶桑改良區為積極改良生絲品質起見，對蠶繭處置辦法，業經訂定通知農戶採用辦法共有三項，如下：</p>
<p>（一）不可利用日光晒繭，以免優良繭質變劣。（二）不可用優良蠶繭，繅製土絲，以免售價減低，收人減少，應用新式絲車　製優良生絲。（三）不可自留土種以致影響成繭及生絲。</p>
<h3>美棉絡繹而來　本棉大受影響</h3>
<p>頃據棉紗業某鉅子稱，戰後美棉輸入頗多，售價不比本國所產者高，且質地較優，故目前一般廠商，均喜購用美棉，致本國棉花銷路大受影響，至於華北西北之產棉區，則因交通困難，運費昂貴，運滬成本反較美棉爲高，故上列諸地運棉來滬者極少，且華北西北各省，連年匪患侵擾，產量亦復銳减，亟望政府當局作有效救濟，庶免華棉一蹶不振。</p>
<h3>救濟商營損害船舶　交部擬定貸款標準</h3>
<p>戰時商營船舶，間接或直接因戰事關係，受有損害，請求政府貸欵救濟者，其地域包括川粤桂湘鄂贛諸者，待修船隻計輪船二八六艘，撥船一一八艘，囤船十五艘，申請貸欵總額約二十餘億元，其救濟方法，擬由國家銀行予以低息貸欵，關於貸欵之標準，據回有關方面探悉，交通部已擬定辦法如下。</p>
<p>（一）貸欵船舶核給之標準，1在O2噸以上者，2船齡在二十年以下者，3在航政官署登記有案者，4撈修費用不超過本船造價十分之七者。　（二）貸款修船之監督及稽核由各地航政局或由交部委托地方政府辦理。</p>
<p>（三）貸款來源，由父部呈請行政院轉四聯總處貸給。</p>
<p>（四）償還期間，最長不得超過五年。</p>
<h3>無梭織　自動八小時　無需人照顧</h3>
<p>英國團比郡土廠，正應用無梭織機製造織物，此種新機能製造普通織機所不能製造之織物，在石絨原料上，且可不斷編織，旣無雜聲，亦不震動，據稱一精巧之工人及一助理，能看守二十四架無梭織機，毫無困難，此機曾自動編織帆布八小時，並無工人在旁照顧，倘應用一適當之經錢，則可毫不停留繼續編織二十四小時。</p>
<h3>外埠價高·客帮收買　金市由疲轉堅　美鈔較前收微挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍難支持，端節關係，各業存欠亟需軋平，以致供過於求，晨站一八〇萬外，惟不久即被多方了結所壓小，同時爲配給價格關係，買戶均存觀望，退至一七八萬以下，中行配給五十七條，價一七七萬五，入後仍鮮變動，午刻復退至一七六萬，午後初時平平，迨隔日交割開做，稍稍哄高至一七九萬左右，但四時後市價又變，因外埠金價回漲，蘇錫客帮收買，最後復穿出一八〇萬大關，結果較上週六回升二萬左右，飾金自十八萬八掛高至十九萬二，紋銀平而銀元微落，暗拆銀根被外界帶緊，息價自一角半至二角。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔平庸，過程較金市稍穩，自晨初二三四〇元小挫至二三二〇元，午刻仍在此價掙扎，午後亦然，結果較前收微挫五元，港票被電匯帶好五元，港匯受港埠申電報縮影響，喊四三五元有供，羅比亦扳高至五二八元始肯賣出，惟成交不多，美匯仍乏變動。</p>
<h3>關棧存貨逾期　准展至八月底</h3>
<p>現存於江海關關棧中之進口貨物，多有未辦淸進口手續者，按照定章，關棧存貨期限，不得超過十二個月，前項存棧貨物，率多逾期，經已展限至本年六月卅日爲止，茲聞海關常局爲體卹商人起見，恐屆期猶未能辦淸手續，特再展至八月卅一日云。</p>
<h3>昆明銀行　滬行定期開業</h3>

<h3>紫銅荒　歐美今皆不敷用　美限價或將提高</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕美國本年上半年，雖已向智利購獲紫銅三萬噸，但紫銅荒歉情形，仍未緩和，本年第一季英國會由羅特西亞加拿大及比屬剛果等地，輸人三八·七〇〇噸，出口銅料，則僅及一〇·二〇〇噸，餘二八·五〇〇噸，留供本季之耗用，估計本年需要量，當在七四·七〇〇噸左右，一九四五年年底，政府本擬存儲一二三·〇〇〇噸，與去年存量三〇〇·〇〇〇噸相較，差額已大，迄至去年三月杪，現已减少至八〇·〇〇〇噸之下矣，英國自二月份起，業已停止紫銅出口，三月份數量，不過七二噸，照目前之消費量而言，雖有智利之三〇·〇〇〇噸，及其他進口貨，尙難維持目下不足之水準，其與智利之購買合同，原係曩昔簽訂者，較現在七二磅一噸之價格，懸殊甚鉅，故世界銅價之上漲趨勢，實使英政府感受焦慮，聞法國新記曾向美國以八二磅一噸之價格，採購一批，其價格約等於業已交貨之智利銅價七八磅之數，美國之限價，可能由得磅一角二分高至一角四分（即每噸合英磅七八磅），在政府與帝國各生產商獲得滿意，詳商之前，英國國內之銅價，自不應即隨之提高，在目前鋁之競爭，已述白熱化，以及一般公認銅荒爲時不致漫長之信念下，目下銅價上漲之趨勢，不久自可澄淸，各帝國生產商，應以獲得英國市塲之長期保證爲要務，當不願在此不正常之暫時荒缺下，而錙銖計較，爭一二便士之利云。</p>

<h3>票據交換所　隸屬問題未決</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業聯合準備委員會成立在即，至票據交換所將來是否獨立，抑隸屬於上項機構，頗爲一般人士所關心，據悉上海票據交換所，在抗戰以前，係由銀行業聯準委會辦理，勝利後，乃由財部金融特派員辦公處指令銀錢兩業，在中央銀行管理之下合辦，關於以後如何組織，有無變更，則須俟聯合準備委員會正式成立後，再行定奪。</p>
<h3>印棉出口證　七月底截止</h3>

<h3>英觀察家敦促　紡織業革新設備</h3>
<p>〔路透社曼撤斯德三日電〕附屬於美國駐日紡織代表團之前英國觀察家溫德巴頓，昨日吿路透社特派員稱，荷蘭加斯德紡織工業欲求恢復已往之繁榮，則必須將其廠中設備實行革新，並採取日夜兩班制，至於費用，不應認爲問題，美國即依照此項辦法力謀發展，美國旣能如此，英國又何　不能，在棉花與人造絲方面，吾人應將日本亦視爲一競爭者。</p>
<h3>呢絨實銷減少</h3>
<p>呢絨　　品，邇來實銷方面無不减少，公茶會上之標準行情，因之　趨平疲，巡視棋盤街一般剪銷華服抱料之門莊帮，南京路四川路林　路湖北路一帶之西服帮，每日交易，無不淸淡異常，五荒六月，固爲歷年必有之現象，而做工太貴，亦其一因，按戰前做西裝一套，呢料的需法幣十二元，做工爲八元，現在則工資高過呢料，呢料祗有十二萬元，做工則須十五萬元至廿萬元云。</p>

<h3>海門在挺進中</h3>
<p>— 五月廿八日海門通訊　疾風</p>
<p>和上海一江之隔，位與江北朮縝—南通相比鄰的海門縣，並不是名聞海內的浙江商港海門。記者介紹一縣的狀况之先首須介紹該縣的父母官的爲人。縣長劉道平，魁梧身材，四十歲不上的年紀。聽說在抗戰期間，是湯恩伯將軍麾下的一員秘書，他具備了做縣長應有的條件：精明，强悍，廉潔，民主。</p>
<p>緩兵計　嚇退共軍</p>
<p>四月底，共軍在蘇北發動「攻勢」，海門縣市，於危急之秋，劉縣畏不離縣署，妙計解圍，允膾炙人口。當共軍進迫縣市之時，國軍數寡，勢難力敵，緩兵又遲遲未到，縣長急中生智，星夜派員密令居民，於翌日黎明，須赴指定地點，迎接已由靑龍港登陸之國軍三團主力部隊，到縣增援。事爲共軍密探所悉，進迫之師，竟悄然退去。又一日，援兵果至，縣城得吿無恙。</p>
<p>劉縣長對於敎育事業，亦極重視，因鑒及戰後師資零落，程度參差，於是首先着重小學敎師之甄選。對於屬員則和睦懇摯，治理縣政，則絕不容稍待，日必躬自審査，縣府經濟收支絕對公開。</p>
<p>一個縣　兩個世界</p>
<p>講到海門縣的治安，實是使人浩嘆。勝利了如許久的日子，海門縣內，現在爲國軍接收的，還祗有海門縣市，天補鎭，靑龍港及三廠鎭四處市鎭據點。在那裏一切趨向復興的道途，人民生活有保障，行動有自由。國府明令的禁烟運動，也已由警察局利用保甲制度嚴密推進，登記，調査，傳訊，勒戒……辦理不遺餘力。反觀共軍所控制的大部份地區，地痞，流氓，游手好閒之輩，都做了「民兵」，手持「插子」（七首之類）一把，儼然「英雄」。「游擊小組」，盒子槍一枝，手榴彈幾個，就是活閻羅。殺人，越貨，「上司」特許。殺死的人總當他是「國特」，「頑固份子」。搶人錢財，方是名正言順的「共產」。以前的鄕保長，都嚇得跑了，流亡在南通，鎭江，上海等地，於是牽黃牛的牧童做了保長，目不識丁的魯夫做了鄉長。三天一小會，五天一大會，「鳴鼓而聚之，擊木而召之。」有錢的人，果然給他們「共」光了。就是一日不做一日不活的眞正農民，同樣是給他們吵得不能寗息。</p>
<p>文化界　走向復興</p>
<p>縣境有縣立中學，商辦中學，敎會—天主堂—中學各一所，曩昔與浦東中學等齊名，曾斐聲敎育界之私立海門中學，校舍雖被燬於炸火，現亦由原校長蔡蔭恩先生主持，借縣市中山堂復課，以上學校均集中縣市房屋較多，並有保障之故。敎員大都爲富地學者，而曾服務敎育界的老前輩。小學校每鎭每鄉有一二所不等，大槪設於市鎭的多完全小學，設於鄕村的多初級小學。縣府於今春下令全縣小學校，一律改稱國民學校，切實履行國民敎育，然而小學校散處各地，大部還處於共軍控制之區，縣府一番苦心，能收何種效果，豈能逆料？</p>
<p>海門報紙，勝利後有新海門日報之創刋，不久又有江海日報之復刋。該縣即以此二報爲民咽喉。惜兩報篇幅太小，印刷又托印刷所代理，鉛字時有缺少。在這供求懸殊，設備不周的環境下，能有此二張報紙出現，也算差强人意了。</p>
<p>全縣有公共圖書館一所，在縣署貼鄰，惜藏書於兵亂之中，散佚不少目，下所存，寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>工業界　紗布為主</p>
<p>工業生產，本有二廠：一爲三廠鎭的大生第三紡織公司，又稱大生三廠，出產魁星牌等商標之紗，布，暢銷大江南北，聲譽卓著。一爲張嗇公故里—長樂鎭之頤生釀造酒廠，出品之船牌，地球牌等烈性酒，早年譽滿中外，一九〇六年並榮獲意大利特種獎狀。二廠均爲張嗇公手創，於抗戰期內，均蒙重大損失。大生三廠，曾被日寇强佔數載，後雖發還，而重要機械零件，多被刦走，一時工作不能進行，陷於停頓，現雖復工，全部機器仍不能完全動工。頤生廠之損失，爲狀更慘，釀酒工具，旣蕩失無存，廠屋又迭遭敵僞摧殘，牆坍壁倒，鳥獸爲巢，令人目不忍睹，開廠更是遙遙無期。故目下該縣工業生產，僅有大生三廠之紗和布矣。</p>
<p>麥登場　豆黍蟲害</p>
<p>海門多高地，不適種稻，農作以麥，豆，黍，棉花爲主。居民多耕種爲活，耕耘施肥，墨守舊規。肥料以人糞，豆餅爲主，肥田粉絕不肯用，且認爲用肥田粉施於農作物後，當年收獲固能增加，然而由此田地瘠弱了。</p>
<p>居民主要食糧之元麥，現已登塲，市價每市石一萬七八千元，新麥晒乾需打七或八折，每擔價格實需二萬餘元。輔助食糧爲玉獨黍，今年秧苗與大豆小叶同爲虫害，農家束手無策，萬分焦慮。今黍苗如此，收成無望，糧食前途，實堪憂慮。</p>
<p>蠶不養　伐桑為薪</p>
<p>鄕民副業本爲養蠶，今因我國蠶絲業一蹶不振，又因燃料奇昂（海門燃料—艸柴—求過于供，戰前與糧食之比爲一石米易二千斤柴；戰後一石米只能易六百斤榮），砍桑爲薪，已乏養蠶之家。鄕民於農閒之際，什九紡紗，織布，輔助生活，成爲副業。鄕民所織之布，南至上海，北至蘇北各埠。土布以斤兩計値，據悉目下市價每百斤爲二十二萬左右。</p>
<p>圖片說明：希特勒情婦伊娃布朗和兩歷來源不明的孩子，希特勒的女人不能算少，但醫生們一致認爲這位慣於自卑在的伊娃布朗正是希特勒的理想伴侶。</p>
<h3>解答一個神秘的謎　希特勒作繭自縛　暗殺案是希魔的致命傷　本報編譯室特譯稿</h3>
<p>希特勒的生死問題似乎是一個神秘的謎。據合衆社廿二日柏林電稱：希特勒及其情婦伊娃勃朗並未自殺，尙在人間。但據五月四日出版的美國「柯里爾」雜誌所載「希特勒的精神分析」一文所述，希特勒的不在人間，已成定論。茲將該文節譯於後，藉供揣摩。本文原著者恩羅少佐（Mojor　Cortez　F．Enloe，Jr．）是美國轟炸戰略研究所醫藥組主任，曾從事研究轟炸對於德國人民健康的影響。合著者李斯博士（Dr．Hans　Reese）是威司康辛大學神經病學敎授，亦爲上述研究所專家之一。兩氏曾就有關希特勒健康的俘獲文件加以硏究，並親自盤問希魔私人醫生吉辛博士，對於希特勒的健康，神經性的憂懼，過度的猜疑，以及希氏最後一年中心智的退化，都有詳細的分析和醫藥上的新見解。</p>
<h3>希魔私人醫生　獲得精神結論</h3>
<p>在一年以前的本週內，希特勒神秘而奇詭地結束了，他的一生，——一個註定的不可避免的命運的歸宿。這是從希特勒的私人醫生的蹬件中演譯而得到的一個結論，他們曾經體認到希氏的肉體和精神的內層，也曾經目睹希氏在最後一刻自投滅亡的深淵。</p>
<p>醫生的言論是沒有國界的，也許惟其因爲我們是醫生，所以我們纔能獲得充分的情報，以證明希氏最後數年中的生理和心理狀態，當我們向希特勒的私人醫生問話時，他們以醫生對醫生的態度，閑散地，滔滔地談論到他們的名震全球的病人。這樣我們便獲得了有關德國元首的最秘密的情報。</p>
<p>希特勒的貼身醫生代表着納粹醫界的一個縮型，從著名的科學家到卑鄙的庸醫。而主宰着希特勒的恰恰是後者——一個狡猾的庸醫。他的名字呌毛雷爾博士，他是希特勒的最親信的心腹和願問。同時是他的健康保護人。</p>
<p>在相反的一方面是謙和的白蘭脫敎授，他是希特勒的私人外科醫生，同時是德國的極有資格的衛生署長。介於這兩位極端人物之間的基自滿自足的瑞士籍德國衛生局長康悌博士，當他得悉聯合國要把他視作戰犯時，他就結果了自己的性命。所幸在他自殺以前，我們已經盤問過他三天。其他兩個醫生在希特勒的扈從中比較的不重要：一個是耳鼻喉科專家吉辛博士，一個是黑衣衛隊的主任外科醫生蓋勃哈脫博士，他是最後目睹希特勒活着的一個人。</p>
<h3>盟國機師　海門蒙難史一頁</h3>
<p>記得民國卅四年六月十二日晨四時許，有盟邦美國銀色巨型飛機一架，墜落於蘇北海門縣宋季港第一區泗安鄉。其時正在潮水高漲之際，該機突落於長江大水中。當時殉難者八名，生者三名，一位是雷特蒙少尉。一位是茄吐軍曹，再一位是納斯脫軍曹。道三位，同乘橡皮艇登岸，呆坐於江邊茅屋中。後由該鄕鄕長倪振興得悉，即派鄕民護送離開險地回里之遙，藏於蘆草中。至八時許，日軍已探得消息，旋即率領大批僞軍警到出事地點，四面包抄，先追査美機師下落，一面將機上物件完全拆去。當時又嚴重訊問該鄕鄕長，但鄕畏始終堅不吐實。敵軍卽在鄕間抄査數日，亦無綫索。是夜，鄉長立刻派人將美機帥改換服裝，送至脫險地區。不意隔了三日，奸徒報吿日軍，日警備隊長卽將該鄉長拘至海門三廠日軍司令部，施以酷刑拷打，並用種種利誘方式嚴加訊問，因不露實情而遭拘留二星期之久。勝利後，去年十二月間，有美軍外事局顧問畢範宇先生率領軍艦到海門宋季港收運屍體，常由該鄕長接見，卽派民夫將所埋死屍，挖掘搬運，照料一切，送至美艦，握手而別。此一事實，經過情形，本報前已揭載，惟語焉不詳，茲特就本人所知，從實報道，以見民間對抗戰之貢獻與盟軍之熱情。</p>
<h3>希特勒私生活　迄今傳說紛紜</h3>
<p>希特勒雖患有胃腸老病，時常反胃和發生劇烈痙攣，但是他的私人醫生並不認爲他患的是癌症，如他的敵人所希望的。他的腸胃病大概是由於他的奇特的飲食習慣和服藥過度所致。希特勒只要有一點痛癢，就需要吞丸藥，打針和調整他的飲食方法。據他的私人外科醫生白蘭脫說，接一連二的注射維他命，荷爾蒙，葡萄糖等補針，在希氏是家常便飯。只要希特勒有一些感冒的徵象，毛雷爾，就得替他注射預防感冒的針藥六針之多。逢到希特勒準備公開演說以前的一星期，毛醫生也就照樣來一套這玩意兒，無怪希氏要患着各種虛弱的毛病了。</p>
<p>雖然外間流傳着希特勒私生活的種種傳說，但是我們沒有理由可以相信他的性生活是變態的。希氏的全副精神灌注於瘋在的納粹主義，無暇注意到女色方面去。他的醫生雖然證實他偶然也曾和德國的女伶發生過關係，但是他的情婦伊娃勃朗到底是他的理想的伴侶，能够給予他所需要的愛情和諒解。</p>
<p>舊派普魯士人　使他衆叛親離</p>
<p>一九四四年七月二十日這一天可說是希特勒一生中最大的危險時期，也可以說是德國最大的危險時期，因爲希特勒就在這一天遭遇到有計劃的暗殺。策動這一個計劃的是一羣舊派的普魯士人，他們設法在希氏心中引起種種心理反應，使得他親叛衆離，終於陷入精神上的深淵而不能自拔。</p>
<p>德國最高統帥司令部設於東普魯士拉斯登堡附近的樺樹林中，祗有絕對可靠的納粹要人纔能通過三道關口而深入司令部的禁地。暗殺希特勒的計劃就在這裏進行。兇手是德國參謀總部裏的史韜芬堡上校。他是司令部和柏林陸軍部之間的傳驛官。七月二十日的早晨，史氏由柏林乘專軍到達司令部，通過黑衣衛隊的崗位，逕往會議室。他的一隻公文袋裏放着文件，另一隻袋裏放着一顆炸彈。當他把第二隻袋安放在會議桌一端的橡木撑板裏面以後，他的使命便完成了，這時恰恰十二點鐘，史韜芬堡離開會議室以後，納粹的陸海軍和黨政大員照例在那裏和希特勒舉行例會。</p>
<p>希特勒坐在長桌的一邊中間座位，背向着門口，　桌而坐的都是德國軍政大員，但是戈林，希姆萊和戈培爾三人却不在座。伏斯海軍上將在這一幕裏變成了最重要的脚色。他恰恰坐在長桌撑板的前面，不得不把他的兩條腿騎跨在撑板兩旁，却被那隻文件袋阻擋住，於是他就用下肢運動把那文件袋）移到另外一邊去。據希氏私人醫生說，伏斯的這一個無意的舉動保全了希特勒的生命</p>
<p>那顆炸彈就在當天中午十二時五十分轟然爆炸。考弗羅，勃蘭脫，波登赫茲和柏格爾四位大將當塲炸死坐在希特勒對面的鏗希海軍上將和弗來揚將軍被拋至窗外，受有重傷，其餘在座的人，包括希特勒在內，無一不受傷。那炸力把希特勒從坐椅裏彈出來直向大門口門的柱撞。屋頂剛剛塌下時，他就從門口飛奔出去。</p>
<p>希特勒雖然受有重傷，但不是永久性的，他的最重最持久的創傷，倒是心理上的。他的耳鼓破裂，腦部受輕微的震盪，右肘挫傷甚重。他感到頭朵和聽覺遲鈍。他的右臂幾乎不能動彈，但是他的醫生誰也不能尋出他右臂的關節，肌肉或神經受有何種損傷。醫生的結論，一致公認希氏右臂的動彈不得是一種心象轉換的歇斯的里亞，是由於不快的回憶引起的生理反應，漸漸破壞了他的個性。這是希特勒的精神上的重大損失。</p>
<p>暗殺案發生後　希魔預感崩潰</p>
<p>希特勒是一個最重忠貞的人，凡是忠心於他，不管能力如何，他便容納他。他自認爲上蒼特選的世界領袖，他覺得收受一個門徒等於神恩布施，那門徒應該對他表示感恩不盡。這一次狙擊竟發生於心腹的內圈，使他不能不感到萬分心灰意冷。從此以後，他對於他的部下無論誰都不敢完全信任了。</p>
<p>希特勒於暗殺事件發生後，初次體認到他的崩潰就在眼前了。那時蘇軍節節勝利，向德國邊境進逼，同時聯合國軍隊已衝出諾曼第，袋形區域，聯合國空軍漸漸取得了德國國內的空中覇權。那顆炸彈已經決定了德國的最後命運。希特勒有着銳敏的觀察力，他看到他的許多幕僚不惜冒性命危險，以圖消滅他，俾便剷除投降的障礙，定必認爲德國是戰敗了。他的人格的一面雖然不能接受這一個結論，可是它的另一面被恐怖和憎恨控制着。這種難以抑制的情緒終於促成了他的自殺。</p>
<p>希特勒的人格的顯著的一面是一個不可抵抗的眞我。因爲他感到自己地位的低落，不得不竭力把這個眞我提高起來。他好像有兩重人格：一種是他自己所認識的人格，一種是他所需要的人格。他不惜任何犧性以保護他的後面一種人格—他的眞我。可是他越想提高這個眞我，越是不能抵抗他的理想的破滅的壓力。</p>
<p>不認自己失誤　一味歸咎他人</p>
<p>希特勒具有唯我獨尊的觀念？認爲他纔是德國的唯一救星。他是極端自負的，他從不承認自己的錯誤。他的這種性格對於他的親信屬僚實在是一種重大的威脅。他自己的失敗，自己的錯誤，往往歸咎於他人。</p>
<p>他的醫生或他所召見過的納粹黨員，或任何德國軍人的日記裏，從來沒有提到希特勒曾經自認錯誤的。在戰爭將近結束的幾個月中，希特勒動輒發佈緊急而難辦的命令，使他們常常因辦理不力而遭到嚴厲的申斥和難堪的侮辱，因此人人感到自己地位的危險。如果他們根據充分的理由，不贊同希特勒的意見，而向他直言無隱，那麼一定被他斥爲戰敗論者。反之，如果他們計聽言從，完全接受他的主張，那麽就得遵命努力做去，絕無假借的餘地。某納粹軍官曾經批評說，無論你選擇那一條路走，都有被判死刑的危險。希特勒的左右都有騎虎難下之慨。在希氏遭遇暗殺以後六個月，他的進行性的神經病不時發作。某納粹顯要曾經說過：「希特勒的瘋狂程度實在使人難堪。他往往發出緊急命令，隔了一天又突然收回成命。這些命令旣糊塗不淸，又支離滅裂，可是有人偶加詢問或請求解釋時，他便大發雷霆。」</p>
<p>蓋世太保領袖　曾圖殺害希魔</p>
<p>據說德國「蓋世太保」領袖希姆萊和希特勒的私人醫生毛雷爾曾經有慢性毒害希魔的共同陰謀。關於這件事雖然沒有確鑿的證據，但是毛醫生所開的藥方確有這種企岡的重大嫌疑。</p>
<p>希特勒的另一位醫生吉辛博士有一次因出於好奇，把毛醫生配給希特勒每天吞服的黑丸藥偸取了一顆，加以化騐，發見它含有番木鼈鹼和阿特洛品。常服這兩種藥物對於神經系統大有妨害。毛雷爾當然知道長期使用這兩種藥物會發生麻醉的作用。</p>
<p>由於毛雷爾藥物的麻醉，健康的日漸敗退，暗殺案引起的震駭，以及戰事的失利，希特勒的精神漸漸不支了。</p>
<p>從吉辛最後一次遇見希特勒時所得到的印象，很明顯地說明了希特勒在臨死以前幾天裏的性格的變化。在這幾天裏希特勒的談話有些語無倫次，心不在意。一件事還沒有談完，忽然轉移到另一個問題上面去，使聽的人們捉摸不着他的眞意，因而引起極大的恐怖。</p>
<p>最後服侍希特勒的醫生是蓋勃哈脫敎授。蓋氏是黑衣衛隊裏的軍醫總監和德國紅十字會會長。蓋氏於四月二十六日早晨二時，即希特勒和他的情婦伊娃勃朗自殺以前四十八小時，前往德國元首府謁見希特勒。那時希氏正站在防空壕裏的一間小房間中，蓋勃哈脫吿訴他，希姆萊推選他繼格拉維茲敎授視任紅十字會會長，請求希氏核准。希氏恬靜地回答說：「紅十字會會長，啊，啊，我現在對這些事情不再感到興趣了。請你不要來打擾我。「說罷他就回轉身去，坐下來像在深思似的。</p>

<h3>向「人類」呼籲</h3>
<p>主筆先生：看到南京專電，公務員（當然包括敎育人士）待遇調整，還未決定，使我發生幾點奇異。</p>
<p>（一）全國公敎人員已到最後一息的時期，政院諸公不是不知道。幾星期來，報上對這問題，每次總載着待下週決定，於是全國千百萬垂斃的公敎人員，眞是在「拼命」的延續着一口氣，不肯讓他斷去。但一個下周，兩個下周，儘管下周下去，試問這千百萬垂斃的人還能待得幾個下周？</p>
<p>（二）立法院李慶　先生說；「決定公務員待遇者，皆不需薪水以維持其生活，一切皆可由公家開支，難怪對公務員待遇調整之建議，加以阻撓。」這是指誰？大概人數太多了，李先生不便樓指出來，我們又無緣認識。但李先生的話是「人道」的，我們誰都不能否認的。被李先生所指不需薪水以維持其生活一切皆可由公家開支而阻撓公務員待遇調整之建議者，政院諸公，恐亦不能無分兒吧！</p>
<p>（三）我眞懷疑，假使行政院的確是中國的政府，而政院諸公又的確是中國政府的官吏，那末這千百萬奄奄垂斃的公敎人員，一定不是中國人，吾則爲什麽受這樣的冷視？爲什麽他們挨到今天，還要來一個「尙未決定」？</p>
<p>我擠身在或許還自認爲中國人的千百萬公敎人員叢中，一面和他們受着同樣的痛苦，一面被立法院「人道」之言刺激得發生感動，說上這許多不知輕重不知利害的話，向「人類」來作一個呼籲。石少逸，五月卅日寄自太倉。</p>
<p>奉公守法者之苦悶</p>
<p>主筆先生：鄙人於數年前在舊英租界購置房屋一所，以爲居住。抗織勝利，市地政局卽明令自卅四年十一月十八日起至卅五年一月十八日止，限期辦理土地登記，逾限申請登記者科以罰金，或由政府代爲保管處理等情。鄙人以一正當商人，自應奉公守法，且屬必經之手續，亦無須觀望，爰於去年十二月將該房屋所有契據圖形及證件等，送呈地政局登記處申請登記，取回臨時收據一紙，幷詢問經手職員何時可以辦妥？據說，先經丈量淸楚，再經市政公報公吿，兩個月後如無料葛，卽通知領取正式所有權狀，的三個月時間辦理完竣等語。惟自送達至今，瞬將半年，地政局旣未派人來丈量，市政公報亦未有公吿，而鄙人近以滬上開銷浩繁，擬搬家返鄉，將房屋出賣俾作盤川，卽與地產經紀人磋商。彼等以登記手續未竣，不能過戶，而各項契據證件不能交出，該臨時收據又不足以取信於人，無法可售。乃不得已向登記處催促發給正式證件。據謂査該房屋之原道契，已向前經理之洋行取回存局，照道契所附岡形，雖有列明劃分若干段，面積多少，而分建房屋若干所，但必須全塊地皮所有人完全由請登記，方可丈量，現因一部分尙未來登記，無從辦理等語。鄙人申明原道契旣附有列明某所房屋界至及面積之圖形，則各房屋自有其獨立性之根據，固可個別丈量，不應以少數之延宕，而貽誤多數人之權利。如必須各所有人到齊乃辦，倘其永遠不來登記，則已申請登記者亦將永遠擱置乎？經手人答以局方未有別種辦法，無可奈何。竊雙吾人以奉公守法，遵令登記，政府應予以便利，儘速辦理，藉資獎勵，曷爲存心觀望者竟得自由，而奉公守法者反受束縛，不能脫手？此中苦悶，無可言宣。詢之友人，同此感覺者，實繁有徒。請將此函揭諸讀者意見權內，容或執政諸公知所改善。</p>
<p>李敬文謹上，五月卅一日</p>
<p>小公務員之呼號</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人爲一小公務員，每月按照基不數四萬元，底薪一百六十倍計算，月的七萬元左右。蒙政府以若此巨數之寵賜，當如何淬勵奮發，以圖報於萬一。而物價之漲風與日俱增，求粥湯而不可得，且乏恒產塡補，致妻兒號飢，中心憂憤之不遑，尙何工作精神之可言？近閱報載，立法院通過調整待遇辦法，方幸稍可喘息，詎知竟有人謂數字過巨，恐難實行之語，是則此輩除薪津外，或有歛財之方，抑或辟穀有術，不嘗人間煙火，視啼飢號寒者，爲凡夫俗子之所爲，自視爲超等動物，漢然無動於中乎？嗟夫！腦滿腸肥，富貴若仙，哀鴻遍野，充耳不聞，身負重責，能不內疚神明，捫心自愧哉？良心復員，此其時矣！淸廉之公務員，已面臨絕境，除迅予合理解次外，切勿再事延宕，否則尸位素餐之議，蓋難免矣。維卿上。</p>
<h3>「解放區」的政治作風</h3>
<p>主筆先生：日寇投降，淪陷區次第收復。中共當局，嫌收復區不够革命，高揭「解放區」，加以强調。德國人由解放蘇台德區而解放捷克；日本人由解放南洋而劃定共榮圈；中國國內也來道一套，這是很可玩味的事。就算是解放區吧，解放的對象是民衆，原來地區的大小和名稱，絕無問題，何必紛更？中共從抗戰到解放，添區設縣改名，一直沒有停過·日本人改琉球爲冲繩，强指東三省爲滿洲，以後又創出冀東·華北·華中·華南等名稱，那是有侵略作用的。現在解放區有所謂蘇中·華中等名目，不知又爲了什麼？卽使退一步講，對內採取革命手段，但像這等變更行政區域的重大事件，是否應該採納民意，依合法手續，留待到最復再辦？</p>
<p>解放區一切措施，似乎矛盾多而誠意少。一面協商，一面襲擊；一面宣傳精（兵）減（政），一面又不斷擴軍；一面宣傳增產，一面又不顧農忙，朝公審，夕開會，幷且到處勸人脫離生產吃現成糧；一面宣布三三制（國共中立派各占三之一），一面又製造三資鬥爭，將其餘三分之二的人擠走，一而替佃農爭田，替雇工爭工錢，一面又用公糧公草稅契慰勞等名目剝削農工；一而沒收僞幣法幣，一面又派人硬用出去，或到別地方去囤貨。諸如此類，歸納起來，目標僅有一個，便是：使富人變窮，窮人更窮，大家都窮了，才好一夥兒去當兵打江山，讓無產階級來專政。這種作風，似乎抄襲蘇聯，但情乎許多地方學走了樣，並不是眞有什麽老民主或新民主。試問八年抗戰，民衆是否需要喘息一下？中俄國情是否相同？中共在國內的歷史是否有蘇俄革命黨那樣悠久？上中下各階層的人材是否有蘇俄那樣多？當前的國際是否能容許我國國內再來一次武力流血的大革命？揠苗助長是否能成功？中共對於這些問題，却一概推不懂，一味蠻幹。盲人瞎馬，危險異常！至於目前中共下層表演得最出色的，如：抓了罰，罰了放，放了再抓再罰；判了審，審了又判；算倒賬，報宿仇，套　包，畫鳥他；乃至劃地爲牢等等行動，有時候主客體也不分，檢舉人兼做執行人，使人民大衆，對於很莊嚴的政治工作，發生幼稚可憐之感。從前小學校一度試行學校市，挾書包的兒童，也學了幹市長局長，揠苗助長，有識之士都認爲要不得，現在解放區的政治又變成兒戲化了，同樣地要不得。</p>
<p>有人說：革命不必擇手段。這話未必然。革命行動關係人民大衆的利害，能不擇手段嗎？過去有所謂立三路綫，不是批判過淸算過了嗎？此刻是否準備重演一遍成將來再淸算一次？</p>
<p>又有人說：工人無祖國。這話也待考。蘇聯英美等國服臂社會主義的男女鬥士，何嘗比中國少？他們在本國對外發生戰事的時候，寗願放棄平日之主張，替國家拼命，絕不肯內鬨。不但此也，卽使他們對內採取武力革命行動之際，對於經界貨幣和郵政，照樣維持，決不隨便割裂分歧。蘇聯革命，盧布還是盧布，郵局也照常寄信。現在解放區竟已解放到貨幣和郵政了，甚至於旗幟也得借重人家的！希望關心國事的知識分子，多方面觀察研究討論，使人民大衆增加認識，不要　捧塲—同時也希望中共常局，對目前局勢重加檢討，有無改換作風的必要？政　政策本非一成不變之物，倘若過去做錯了，現在趕快糾正。如果負氣一相情願錯到底，後果是不難想象的。兩敗俱傷，替鄰人或仇人造機會，以救國救民爲職責的革命黨人，豈宜出此！李杞自南通上，五，廿八</p>
<h3>怎樣救災？</h3>
<p>主筆先生：五月三十日貴報有國大代表談湘災一文，讀後令人感嘆不已。「中國饑餓，上海跳舞，」盟邦人士都在替我們着急，而我們自己同胞怎忍坐視呢？美總統已下令美人爲世界饑饉而節食，常局也曾令上海人爲中國饑災而節食，這只是太空洞的事，而一般人想節也無從節起。每天少吃飯自己家用少須省了些，但間接而間接，又有幾粒米到災民身上？我以爲最妥當迅速救災法有下列幾點：（一）由行總供給大量麥粉，空運至各災區投擲。（此法如能實行，則早上批准，中午災區裏就有炊烟了。）（二）上海各大酒樓，飯店，舞廳，娛樂塲皆臨時加徵救災捐，此捐按日結算撥用。（三）大規模餅乾廠或麵包廠撥機趕製救災餅乾或麵包，空運投擲。如果依此法，當局，行總，酒樓，麵包廠，中航公司等合作組成救災委員會，一心一德，羣策羣力，饑饉可以很快挽救的。</p>

<h3>聖鄧斯頓院偉大貢獻　盲人新生</h3>
<p>聖鄧頓盲人院幫助盲人恢復了　他們的自尊心和自信心，使他們感覺他們重新成為社會上有用的人。</p>
<p>英國著名詩人密爾頓失明時曾自慰道：「那些失明的人們也將爲全人類服務」。不過，在過去祗有少數偉大的人物，能在失明後滿意地從事思考或文學的工作。就普通人而言，失明就是他一切活動的終止，他的生活從此就變成寄生性質的生存了。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時，英國有一位聞人皮爾遜爵士，雙目失明了。他具有熱情，很是活動，他不願坐以待斃。他同時想起其他因戰爭而失明的人，他決心要變更因作戰而失明的人的希望。因此得了朋友們的帮忙。設立了一個訓練所，叫做聖鄧斯頓院，收容失明的軍人和婦女。</p>
<p>他在著名的聖鄧斯頓訓練所居住一二年，在工作和游玩方面，學習獨立的能力，就會感覺那奇異的豐滿生活，在而前展開了。</p>
<p>盲人可從勃萊爾式凸起紙上來學習閱讀，也可聽特備的留聲機高讀書本上的內容。此外並學習打字·單獨走路·和享受通常的消遣，若游泳·騎馬·唱歌和音樂。也可玩特印的紙牌：也以可騎在自行車的後座上。盲目的女子，則學習家務的方法。在聖鄧斯頓院裏，有特別的敎員，其中也有盲目的敎員，他們知道如何把這些活動所必需的技術，敎給盲人。用勃萊爾制學習閱讀，的需九個月，方可學會。</p>
<p>盲人學習的工作，一年比一年來得繁多了。聖鄧斯頓院常常訓練製籃工人，不過現在失明的人往往訓練做電話接綫生·按摩員·店員·家禽農夫，速記打字員，和機械士。盲人擔任工業方面的工作將較以前增加，道就是說他們能夠參加普通生活了。盲人所最需要的是能够自謀生活。經濟上的自立恢復了。自尊心和自信心，因爲他感覺他又是社會上一個有用的人了。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰中失明的男女中，約有三千名已能經濟自立了。第二次世界大戰中失明的人到現在爲止，約有一千名已經到聖鄧斯頓院裏來受敎養。不但英國的士兵，就是盟國的士兵，也由聖鄧斯頓院照顧着，當每一位盲目士兵離院時院方贈送一個無錢電收聽器和有聲錶一隻。</p>
<p>當失明的男女離開該院時，雖然已經具有積極生活的能力，可是也能遭遇困難，因此該院特有一個組織，在需要幫忙時加以協助。不論其爲工作上的困難，家庭中的困難，經濟困難或身體欠健，該院福利或技術訪員，隨時可給以指導和實際的援助。</p>
<p>凡受過該院訓練的人均佩帶勳章—生命的火炬—盲人一經該院的訓練，就可發現新而豐滿的生活了。</p>
<p>要不是英國人民給予財政上的援助，則皮爾遜爵士亦將不能使得聖鄧斯頓院成爲這樣的有用。所有聖鄧斯頓院中的訓練，治療和後療工作，都藉自動施濟來資助。英國人民瞭解了所負於世界大戰中為國效勞而致失明的人的地方很多。在上一個財政年度中，該院全部捐款，的在六十三萬磅左右。入院療養的人，並不納費。故英政府所給的津貼，仍舊可以保持。</p>
<p>然則聖鄧斯頓院如何給盲人以新的生命呢？這兒共有三個階段，那就是醫院治療，一般獨立訓練，和特種職業訓練。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，該院得到了政府財政的援助，接收了一個醫院，特爲失明的人醫治，祇要可能的話，總給他恢復一點光明。該院自設海濱療養所，失明的人可在那兒恢復他身體的健康和活力，因爲那兒有舒適和便利的環境。</p>
<p>英新譯自湯卜遜原著</p>
<p>但是蓋勃哈脫接着又說：「我此來另一使命是帮助這裘的婦孺。我已經預備好一輛紅十字會大車子，或許是最後離開柏林的一部車輛了。可否請元首下令，誰應該離去？」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，我們不需要帮助，她們願意留在這裏，但你不妨再問問她們看。」希特勒回答的時候沒有改變他茫然若失的神情。</p>
<p>屋子裏面燈光黯淡，大家雜亂無章地坐着，奸像等待大禍的降臨似的。蓋勃哈脫旋過身來，再向其他的人詢問，但是誰也似乎漫不經心。最後希特勒向大家宣佈說：「蓋醫生將往柏林去，這是你們的最後機會。誰願意去嗎？」還是沒有回答。只有一個女子搖了搖頭。於是希特勒回顧蓋勃哈脫，用厭倦而單調的語氣說：「你看，誰也不願意跟你一同去。」</p>
<h3>爆炸性的行為　造成死滅命運</h3>
<p>蓋勃哈脫的這一段記事使我們明確地看到了曾經統治德國的精神的沒落。這是一個誇大狂者和淫虐在者的精神。常它接受了死神的召喚時，這一種精神終於得到了安息。希特勒的精神並不是一稱變態的精神。他的天賦的慾望，一半在他的主義裏得到了滿足，一半出他的幾個情婦給他滿足。從曾經多年觀察希特勒的德國精神病學家和其他醫生所口述的希氏的行爲中，找不出一些瘋狂的成份來。</p>
<p>希特勒到了最後的階段，神經病的程度達到了最高點。一個精神病患者或瘋人所表現的是幻覺和思想上的其他質的變化，但是一個神經病患者所表現的祗是常態的七情六慾的過度的表現，也就是量的變化。</p>
<p>希特勒一生的結局是他的爆炸性行爲的必然結果。初期的成功養成了他妄自尊火的性格，而漸漸抹煞了理智和判斷力。對於擴張權勢的無　之求和理性及判斷力的內在的鬥爭，使他的精神完全在自己的生命之火燄中給燃燒光了。於是道位德國的獨裁者就此毁滅了他自已。</p>
<p>像希特勒這標的人生，除了自殺和暗殺外，沒有其他的歸宿。正如他的醫生所說的，自戕是希氏精神發展的唯一的目標。這是他逃避不可避免的命遝的唯一出路。</p>
<p>史韜芬堡和暗殺案有關諸人對於希特勒一生的打擊得到了意外的收穫。希氏的心腹醫生和精神病學家相信這件事情是促成希特勒精神破產並加速德國的崩潰和德國元首的死亡的主因。希特勒作繭自縛，畢竟犧牲於此。他生也驕橫，死無善終，可說是果報不爽。</p>

<h3>金條</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>租房子要用金條，當今之世，似乎已成爲天經地義。南京中央日報社長馬星野爲了房東壓迫他和他的主筆，曾寫了一篇「兩個實例一聲呼籲」文章，充滿了憤慨。最末他說：</p>
<p>不合理就是不合理，任何律師，任何法庭，任何報紙，任何嘴巴不能把不合理說成合理！</p>
<p>對於不合理的事，需要我們有勇氣！</p>
<p>我們要向貪得無厭，磨牙吮血的惡房東宣戰！</p>
<p>自然這是書生之見了，向他們「宣戰」又有什麽效果呢？</p>
<p>「世說新語」中記載有這麽一個故事：</p>
<p>「管寧華歆共園中鋤菜，見地有片金，管揮鋤與瓦石不異，華捉而擲去之。」</p>
<p>當時是並無所謂房荒的，不然管華兩位先生一定老早檢起來作爲孝敬房東之需了。</p>
<h3>學徒也需要讀書</h3>
<p>— 陳勉余</p>
<p>自然我得聲明這不是拏書包，進校門的讀書；而祇是說在業餘，可利用的閒暇，隨時隨地適應現實環境選擇自我需愛的有益書籍自修方式的讀書。</p>
<p>因爲在廣大的學徒羣中，也不乏有志求進的靑年，他們爲了生活不得不屈居做學徒，但他們沒有遺忘求學，而事實上學徒又不會進校門求學的便宜事；於是他們開始踏上這在求學，自修於讀書的一條路。</p>
<p>論動機，論鵠的，當然這是不可詆毀的，而是名正言順之舉。可是我不懂竟有非少數的店主，經理，非但對此歧視，乃且絕對禁止學徒讀書。是因爲讀書後有用處嗎？這是不値一笑的。</p>
<p>就在最近聽了幾個此中過來的友人的吿訴我，才恍悟一些。最大的理由，也可以說綜合的籍口，他們以爲讀書會妨害到固有的工作而影響到他本身的利益。</p>
<p>其實這是根本不對的。譬如櫃檯商店的下午，沒什麼事，則又何不可讓好學的學徒們讀一些書？不離開崗位，不走開店門，又怎會疏忽職務？也許有人神經過敏以爲在半途丢了書，招待生顧「偶有主顧的話」，會因此而有懈怠。實在學徒本身決不會有此蓄意的。他們旣理智自己於業餘努力，當然理解環境如何，有着讀書的權利他們祇有感激，因此反而更勞力做事，這是一種必然情緒。</p>
<p>至於從另一方面講，對店主郤有非淺鮮的利益呢：第一，學徒讀了書同樣有了精神的調劑（也可以說消遣，）他們不會轉折到另種不良娛樂嗜好上，自然對於工作有了正常的保證；而且也不至因不良娛樂嗜好所引起的惡果，舞弊營私，而損害店方。</p>
<p>第二，多讀書能增加知識與智慧，因了智慧的增加使學徒有了更多的待酬　客的技巧心得，自然使顧客感到滿堂而使營業發展。</p>
<p>所以　　　　大　喊喊學徒也需要續書！</p>
<h3>國旗</h3>
<p>— 余惕</p>
<p>在目前，上海所掛的國旗，可以說一聲是統一的，國旗的大小，旗杆的修短，以及鐵架子的角度；可是這些是屬于物質的統一。精神方面却是零零落落，沒有統一。如下列幾件事情：</p>
<p>（一）升旗落旗的時間不一——早上升旗的時候，有的在六時左右，有的在八時左右，更有幾處，根本不知道這天是不是應該掛國旗日子，所以非直至警察先生們通知後才掛起來。至于落旗時候更是不一，我曾看見幾處在晚上九時以後還沒有落旗，更荒唐的，甚至忘了落旗，讓國旗在黑暗中飄揚。凡遇驟然下雨時候，應把國旗收下，不應該讓國旗在雨中沐浴，這一點也應該注意的。</p>
<p>（二）全旗與半旗的不一——凡與慶祝的紀念日應該掛全旗，哀悼的紀念日應掛半旗，這不必我來多說。但是有許多時候，應掛半旗的，可是却掛了全旗，例如國父逝世紀念日，應掛半旗而有好些地方却掛了全旗。更如三月廿九日，有的說是慶祝靑年節，所以掛全旗；有的說是黃花岡紀念日所以掛半旗。其實靑年節是不掛國旗的，應該掛半旗。</p>
<p>（三）關于升掛半旗的常識——至半旗的時候，應該先將國旗升至頂端，然後再放下至離頂端一尺的地方。絕不是升到離頂端一尺時便不再上升的。掛半旗的翻候，應該注意，國旗與杆頂的距離是否合乎規定。</p>
<p>以上幾點常識，我想國人都應該注意的。</p>
<h3>周作人　如何科刑</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>誠如陳逆公博所云：「現在誰還敢說我是無罪。」其實本是有罪，當然無人說是「無罪」，敢與不敢是另一問題。</p>
<p>文化漢奸周作人近據電訊已起解來京，公審之期，諒亦不遠。對知堂老人之落水，不能全其晚節，的確是可惜。自五四運動以來，周氏總不失爲中國文壇之重鎭，對新文化之建樹，確有不少汗馬功勞，就是落水以後，也不失爲糞坑中較大的姐蟲，便是現時醜詆其爲「臭文人」之文人，其文恐也多少受到其影響，所以除對周氏本身覺其可惜外，且爲中國文化可惜，像他研究學術精博的人，委實太少了，而太少的學術硏究精博的人，竟爲中國文化留下汚點，怎不爲中國文化可惜。</p>
<p>道並非是爲周作人辯護，說他是無罪，他曾做過僞華北敎育督辦，偽國府委員等特任官，三歲孩子也要以爲他是漢奸。雖是漢奸，不過在調査其罪行後，我想建議當局。不必除死，而代之以無期徒刑，令其譯出全部希臘文學史以自贖。</p>
<p>道部者作，是周逆久擬着筆而未開工者，而周逆對希臘文舉之研究精深確有爲流輩所不及之處，如由其全部譯出，定有不少精彩。對中國貧弱的譯文壇，亦不無小補。</p>
<p>孫子刖足而傳兵法，司馬遷腐刑而著史記，如死刑僅以隔離社會為目的，則局逆如能處終身監禁，獄中無不肖的弟子包圍，當可完成其翻譯的初願。</p>
<p>新聞小天地</p>
<h3>王曉籟說　大家「萬關」</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>五月份工人指數，業已公佈爲四千〇九十餘倍，某宴會席上，王曉籟對此問題發表議論曰：而今物價與幣値相較，已到「萬一關頭」，即現今之一萬元幾等於戰前之一元也·寗波人俗稱凡事至不得了時爲「萬關」，故如今眞正所謂「萬關」矣！（萬關·萬關·一語雙貫，曉老妙人，固多妙語也。）</p>
<p>孫科於日昨在美國同學會聚餐席上演說，詞中談及土地　時，謂上海如有一塊土地或一幢房屋出賣，政府須抽捐稅百分之四十，按之土地法。向無明文規定，實有抵觸之處，但相信上海旣有此舉，或係實行在先，尙未經立法院之通過也，　以幽默之口物，邊笑邊向坐於旁側之吳市長曰：今後希望訂稅者，宜多多熟讀土地法，庶免再有類此情事發生。當時吳市長連連點頭稱是，引起哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>星期六之下午，市長舉行鷄尾酒會於「摩天樓」仕女如雲，盛極一時。國際電梯特開「專號」輸送賓客，但終因來者衆多，陸續不絕，故候梯行列幾遠及派克路。雖非絕後，但已空前。據父際科傳出消息，此次發出請帖共有六百張，但到會來賓，據在塲之記者羣估計至少在九百人以上。詢之開電梯者，對此數字亦認爲相當準確。</p>
<p>酒會來賓中最引人注意者，爲蔣緯國夫婦，蔣夫人爲西北大實業家石鳳翔之女公子，是日蔣夫人全副夏裝，身穿黑白小方格「沙土堅」旗袍，足登最新式之玻璃皮鞋與玻璃絲襪，頗爲一般女賓所賞識。蔣夫人尙戴耳環一對，中嵌紅變，外沿鑽石，頗稱細膩。鑽光賽氣玻璃色，一身兼而有之，爲是日酒會增加生色不少。</p>
<p>席終人散，記者羣談及玻璃皮鞋事，確認蔣緯國夫人之玻璃鞋，尙爲上海第一雙。然據靈通方面人士傳出「佳音」：最近某進口行已辦得新貨數十雙來滬，但愛「美一女郞又深恐一旦公開出售，勢必有僧多粥少之勢，故目前已有人輾轉打聽，準備一挖購」，以免落後而失時髦。</p>
<h3>孝娘歌（做娘忙）</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>『一來忙，</p>
<p>淸早起來開窗亮堂堂；</p>
<p>二來忙，</p>
<p>蓬頭垢面慌忙入廚房；</p>
<p>三來忙，</p>
<p>一頓午飯催保如趕荒；</p>
<p>四來忙，</p>
<p>收拾收拾吊水洗衣裳；</p>
<p>五來忙，</p>

<p>六來忙，</p>
<p>點起燈來拿剪裁衣裳；</p>
<p>七來忙，</p>

<p>一逛；</p>
<p>十來忙，</p>
<p>到說代他娶個妻兒反丢</p>
<p>了我親娘。』</p>
<p>這是一首形容做母親的辛忙的歌謠。在這首歌謠裏，十足的表現出一個母親主持家政和關心兒女的辛苦來。所以，如何孝養母親？怎樣報答母親養育的大恩？這是爲人子者，所該注意奉行的一件事。否則，假如只顧妻子而忽視了母親的孝義，這無論如何，是問心有愧的。</p>
<h3>理想的職業生活</h3>
<p>— 吳宗文</p>
<p>人類的本能，是求生存慾望的滿足。要滿足這種生存的慾望，從經濟學觀點，和社會的組織上來說，必須人人有生產的能力，從事工作。</p>
<p>因爲合人生存在這集體生活的社會中，不能不勞而獲，安坐而食，需要有一種職業，各盡可能，然後才可各取所需。這樣直接是使得每個人獲得相當的工作可做，滿足了自己的生存慾望，間接促進人類文化，增加生產力量，繁榮社會經濟，對於國家民族，是有極大影響的。</p>
<p>職業和生活是有密切關係的。職業是人類求生的工具，是沒有高下貴賤分別的，是人人應該有的。職業是有永恒性的，一方是謀自己的生活—利己；一方是替大衆服務，—利人。根據這種信念，每個從事職業的人，應該抱定爲服務而生活的宗旨，加强工作效率，努力增進生產，才有意義，才能感興趣。</p>
<p>興趣這件東西，能鼓勵人上進，能改善人對事物的新認識，能培養硏究精神，和科學頭腦。世界上有許多成功人，如大科學家，大發明家，大實業家，那一個不是由於對事業有濃厚的興趣，不怕失敗，繼續不斷的去研究，去試騐，去創造，才能達到成功之境，而完成其利己利人的理想職業生活。</p>
<p>可是當前的社會現象，太使我們從事職業的人失望了。每個人竟不能獲得最低限度生活的需要，天天在飢餓綫上徬徨和掙扎，大家都感到生活的威脅，極不安定，對於職業還有什麽興趣可言？這種不合理的現象，是怎樣造成的？是誰阻止我們達到享受較爲合理的職業生活？這是每個從事職業的人，應該硏究，應說明白，應該奮起爭取的。</p>
<p>我們的國家，經過這次艱苦的八年抗戰，終於獲得空前未有的勝利，踏上民主。團結，和平的康莊大道，開始創造勝利的生活。在今後建國的過程中，有許多艱巨的工作，需要各部門從事職業的人們去做。只要我們能够鼓起興趣，負起責任，充實學識，培養技能，各人站在本位上努力，做我們應當做的事，把所有的力量都貢獻出來，深信不難得到一種較有理想的職業生活。</p>

<h3>劉獅展魚</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>與上海畫壇闊別已將八年的名畫家劉獅，在輾轉流徙的生活之中，放棄了油色，畫架，轉向於毛筆，宣紙來雙魚，發揮他一貫的創作力。</p>
<p>劉獅，是常代藝術巨攀海粟先生的胞侄，他對藝術，具有堅實的造形技術，有過人的表現力，由於他的天賦的藝術才能，他的表現力是向多方而發展了。戰前，他主要的是油畫，兼及彫塑，也要弄一些工藝美術，最近回到上海，他確又走上了毛筆畫所謂國畫的一條路，他能够多方面的發展，便證明了他有豐富的才能，也可以說，他是在運用不同的器材來試騐種種的表現效果，絕非迎合一般人的低級的偏愛心理而作國畫的，所以又可說，劉獅是通過了整個造形美術各部門的一個優秀作家。</p>
<p>講到劉獅的藝術風格，抗戰之前，是以油畫爲主，在人物方面，是具有堅實典麗的新古典的傾向，風景與靜物，比較是趨於野獸羣諸家的趣味，尤其在綫的把握上，是堅挺，流暢，綿密，配合着明媚，强烈，沉着的色彩來構成獨特的畫面，使每一個畫面好像發出一種和諧的音節，表現出作家無上的智慧。</p>
<p>因爲劉獅有堅實的造形技術，而通過於泥土，石膏之類的器材，便產生許多彫塑作品，而這些作品，絕非表面的酷似，是有着內在的質的表現，而且有現代藝術共同的傾向，我們似乎只可以麥育（Maillot與蒲台爾（Bourdelle）兩家來和他媲美的。</p>
<p>他從抗戰初期到內地以後，因爲感於外來器材的貧乏，便利用固有的毛筆，宣紙之類來作畫，而所畫的東西，確是水族一類如金魚，鯉，蝦，蟹等，以及獅，虎，和少數人物畫，他是以造形的熟技應用到素來主張主觀表現的所謂國畫方法上去，這些作品，在描寫技術上是非常寫實的，可是中國毛筆畫上所特具筆力，布局，氣勢，等等，畢竟還是很完全的保存着，可能說，這是中國藝術上的，至少是技術上的新發現，該値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>在電話桌機的機座與聽筒間，另聯一可任意灣曲的支架，兩隻手就可自由了。打電話的時候，將聽筒安置在口與耳間量適宜的地位，打完後仍可放回原處</p>
<p>在玻璃製的餐桌中間，設有一蒸汽箱，可减少沒有傭人的主婦，往來奔波於餐室與廚房間</p>
<h3>郎毓秀獨唱會</h3>
<p>六月五六七三日，下午八時一刻，在蘭心大戲院，花腔女高音郞毓秀女士舉行獨唱會，節目有「敎我如何不想他」「還鄕行」「我儂詞」「茶花女中之飲酒歌」以及Handek　Delibes　Arditi　Weckerlin等作品。（右爲郞女士家庭便裝）</p>
<h3>勝利還都留別四川</h3>
<p>— 鄒魯</p>
<p>勝利還都船向東（中華民國三十五年五月二十八日），市民夾岸看坡公。愧無厚德留西蜀，賴有同心奏大功。十載（余以二十六年十二月一日到重慶本日離別）居停忘作客，千難身受訝成翁。河山處處如親友，漫說雲飛唱大風。</p>
<p>三言兩語集</p>
<h3>強盜愛香水</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>最近時作葉子戲，常於最後一張牌時，全神貫注，萬分緊張。因此吾才恍然，於國際交涉至最後重要關頭時，新聞中每用「且看最後一張牌」一語，形容詞之引用恰當，無逾於此，以小喻大，亦惟愛好賭博者，最能領會此中妙處。</p>
<p>上月三十一日，本市發生兩起盜案，供有令人莫解之處：（一）南京西路一靑年，被刦去藏有千餘元法幣之皮夾一只，尾追不捨，致遭開槍，幾乎喪命。此靑年勇敢精神，固可欽佩，若謂僅因捨不得一千餘元（目前千餘元祇够買一包香烟）而甘冒危險，似乎大可不必。（二）霞飛路馬姓家盜刦，損失除法幣十萬元及金鎊等外，另有香水一瓶，强盜亦愛香水，豈不奇乎。</p>
<p>一個正正當當的建議：十八層高的百老匯大厦，至少有二三百個房間，爲何一定要出售，在此屋荒嚴重聲中，公開出租，豈不兩便。</p>

<h3>漢末的政態與人情</h3>
<p>— 劉大杰</p>
<p>東漢末年幾個皇帝，都是短命天子。繼位的大都年紀幼小，什麼事也不懂，自然會弄到太后聽政，外戚專權，宦官得勢。女人宦官和旬戚的鬥爭，演成了東漢末年的亡國歷史。自和帝連合宦鄭衆，殺了專權的外戚實憲兄弟，一直到獻帝時候袁紹帶兵進宮，這九十歲年，全是宦官的天下。中間雖也有外戚如梁冀寶武之流，想從宦官的手裏　取政權，結果是送了性命，一事無成。宦官的勢力，日盛一日，在朝的封侯賜爵，掌管朝政。他們的親屬兄弟，佈滿州縣，刮地皮，害百姓，奪婦女，殺善良。真是弄得民不聊生，天怒人怨。關於他們的種種　惡，史書上有不少的記載，我們讀了，真是只有憤恨與太息。試看後漢書的單超傳：</p>
<p>「單超徐璜具瑗左棺唐衡五人，同日封侯，世謂之五侯。皆競起宅，樓觀壯麗，窮極　巧。金銀罰眊，施於犬馬。多取良人美女，以爲妻妾。皆珍飾華侈，擬則宮人。兄弟姻戚，皆宰州臨郡。辜較百姓，與盜賊無異。」</p>
<p>這些宦官，都是櫃帝時候誅外戚的功臣。一旦得了寵，掌握政權，無惡不作，爲所欲爲了。再看後漢書中所寫的侯　：「食侈奪得縱，前後奪人宅三百八十一所，田百十八頃，起立第宅十有六區，皆有高樓池苑，堂閣相望，飾以綺書丹漆之屬，制度重深，僭類宮省·破人居室，發掘墳墓。虜奪良人，刦略婦子。」這樣的兇惡淫奢，完全是盜賊行爲。到了靈帝，更是寡廉鮮恥。叫蒙上官張　作父親，李忠作母親，一點正事不作，駕着四驢車驅馳郊外，有時候西園弄狗，飲宴爲樂。又叫宮女們在後宮開着小店，販賣雜貨。正式定出價格來，賣官　爵。二千石的官·價二千萬，四百石的官，四百萬，公一千萬，卿五百萬。皇帝積了錢，一齊存到宦官家裏去。這種皇帝同那樣的蒙上官結合起來，在政治上自然會產生出種種的混亂與罪惡。在這種情形之下，想掃除這種惡勢力，決不是幾個正人君子所能爲力的。結果是軍人帶兵進宮，把他們殺得乾淨淨。</p>
<p>從西漢實行土地私有制度以來，於是貴族裏富收買土地，集中財產，小百姓的生計，就日益窮困。王莽雖曾一度將土地收歸國有，限制資本，但他那種政策，完全失敗。到了東漢末年，貴族豪富的勢力，愈形膨脹。他們都有廣闊的田地，壯麗的域堡和荘園，幾千幾百的奴婢，　養無數的勇士刺客，增厚他們的惡勢力。上可以抗朝庭的命令，下可以魚弱小民，刦奪婦女。小百姓處在這種情形之下，只好忍受那種無可形容的痛苦。仲長統在理亂篇說：</p>
<p>「豪人之室，連棟數百，　田滿野，奴婢千羣，徒附萬計。船車買販，周於四方。廢居積貯，滿於都域中。琦賂實貨，巨室不能容，馬牛　羊，山谷不能受。妖童美委，填乎綺室，倡謳妓樂，列乎深堂。實客待見而不敢去，車騎交錯而不敢進。三牲之肉，臭而不可食，清醇之酬，敗而可飲」。</p>
<p>有了錢有了勢，就過着這種享樂的生活誰不羨慕，就是讀書人，也都朝着這條路上走。有的用欺詐，有的用遊說，有的詔媚宦官，有的勾結豪族，不顧名節，不講廉恥，只想達到勢利的目的。「苟智詐者，則得之焉。苟能得之者，人不以爲罪焉。源發而橫亂，路開而四通矣。求士之舍榮而甘窮苦，棄放逸而赴束縛，夫誰肯爲之者耶？」仲長統這幾句話，真是說得最沉痛最切實的了。但是善良的讀書人和小百姓，眼看着這種黑暗腐敗的宦官政治，身受着貴族富豪的經濟壓迫，不能全無反感。思想前進情感熱烈一點的人，自然會發出不滿的言論與行動來。於是有名　的學生運動和農民暴動結連地發生了。</p>
<p>學生運動屬於知識階級，農民暴動屬於元產階級，關於他們種種活動的詳細史料，雖說被正統派的歷史家毀滅了。但我們從零碎的記載裏，還可以看出他們的宗旨和活動，並不是亂臣盜賊的行爲。當時的學生運動，以三萬多個大學生爲主體。他們在那種混亂黑暗的狀態下，再也不能容忍了。於是向那些狐羣狗黨的貪官污吏，發出有力的攻撃對正直的人熱烈的擁護。造成了堅強的輿論。這種輿論，並不是沒的力量。就是那些宦官外戚，也不能掩耳不聞。因此中外承風，競以臧否相尚，自公卿以下，莫不畏其貶議，屣履到門了。他們當時擁護的，是那幾個有思想有胆量的李膺陳和王暢。這三個人雖然官爵大小不等，但誅宦官殺土豪，爲民除害的思想是相同的。大學生因爲擁護他們，喊出口號來了。「天下楷模李元禮，不畏強禦陳仲舉，天下俊秀和不畏強暴的我們就擁護，否則就要排撃。這樣一來，宦官污吏不得不連合起來謀對付。罪名是容易的。「李　等養太學遊士，交結諸郡生徒，誹訕朝廷，疑風亂俗」。這就是够了。於是靈帝就下命令，逮捕黨人，一捕就是二百多。逃了的還要縣賞追捕。這種強盜行爲，並不能壓服青年人的憤恨，只有更激動他的熱情的。范滂對審問官說，古之修善，自求多福。今之修善，身陷大靈，身死之日，願埋於首陽山側」。（後漢書本傳）李膺范滂他們雖是逮捕了，雖是廢錮了，學生運動的集團，並沒有分散，輿論的力量，並沒有減低，反之，更形堅強更形激烈了，加入的人更加多了，聲勢也更加浩大了，宦官們看了這種情形，非來一次大的屠殺不能鎮壓這種運動，那時靈帝只有十四歲天真活潑不大懂什麼事。對蒙上官　節說，你們天天吵着要殺黨人，黨人究竟礙了你們什麼事。曹節太陰毒了，知道非用一句恐嚇的話不可。他說不軌就是學人想打倒你，他們自已來作皇帝。於是十四歲的皇帝，也就動努了。這次的行動，是大規模的，殺了八九百黨人還不算，凡是當時行爲正直有點思想有點學問的人，一概陷　，妻室兒女，俱流竄連塞。范滂行刑的時候，對他的兒子說：「我要你去作惡事，但是惡事實在又作不得。要你去作善事，我是作善事的，但結果又是如此。」這話是多麼的憤恨，多麼的沉育，難怪路旁人聽見了，都爲之流淚哩。</p>
<p>不用說，宦官們是得志了，學生運動是失敗了，當時知識階級中的一點優秀份子，完全死在宦官們的刀口下，文化思想蒙了重大的損失，言論的自由被剝奪盡了。知識界的殘餘者，只好緊在深山裏著　，或是藏在土洞裏修道了。司馬光編完了這段歷史，他曾感慷地說：「天下有道，君子　于王庭，以正小人之罪，而莫敢不服。天下無道，君子襄括不言。以這小人之禍，而猶或不免。黨人錯亂之世，不在其位，西海橫　流，而欲以口舌　之。藏否人物，激濁揚清。撩　蛇之頭，踐虎狼之尾，以至身彼淫刑，禍及朋友，士類殲滅，而國隨以亡，不亦悲乎。」他一面是悲嘆讀書人死得可憐，一面似乎還在　備這些人旣不在其位，爲什麼要評論時政自遭殺殲呢。他這種意見，我們認爲是錯誤的。國隨以亡，黨人更不能負責。這一次的學生運動，我覺得是中國讀書人偉大精神的表現，是爭自由爭正義爭生存的偉大精神的表現。</p>
<p>其次我們再來看看農民暴動的情形。農民旣無知識又無思想，頭腦簡單，生活　質。他們唯一的希望，只要天下太平，可以安然地耕田地謀衣食，不管你當權的是宦官還是外戚。如果官吏富豪過於壓迫他們，使他們求生不得求死不能的時候，他們也就會暴動起來的。漢代末年的農民，在連年不斷的天災戲禍的苦難下忍痛地生活　着，加以貨幣貶值，物價昂貴，富豪貴族官吏的剝奪，於是逃避遷徒，飢餓殺戲戳至於人吃人，結果是死亡。</p>
<p>「安帝永初三年并凉州大飢，人相食。」後漢書靈帝建寗三年，河內人婦食夫，夫食婦。」（同上）</p>
<p>桓帝永樂元年，郡國三十二蝗，河水溢，百姓亂寒，流冗道路至有數十萬戶，冀州尤甚。」（同上）</p>
<p>「太祖至，坑殺男女數萬口於泗水，水爲不流。——攻取夏丘諸縣皆屠之，鷄犬亦盡，墟邑無復行人。」（魏志荀或傳註）</p>
<p>曹操與紹戰於官渡，「凡斬首七萬餘級」。（魏志武帝紀註）</p>
<p>水旱天災加以大的屠殺和飢餓，小百姓還有什麼路可走，因此國內的農民，到處暴動起來，在桓帝的時候，已有自稱皇帝的李堅，寇青徐兗三州的公孫舉，攻殺侯章的叔孫無忌，長沙，零陵，武陵，艾縣，農民暴動的事體幾乎遞地都是。這裏打平那裏又起來，如雨後的春草一樣，到了靈帝，於是各處的小組織，來了一個大聯合，那就是歷史上最有名的黃巾之亂。</p>
<p>黃巾賊並不是突然起來的，也不是受了邪敎或是天帝的指示，敎義與符錄，都是一些幌子。正如太平天國義和團講什麼敎是一樣的。他們唯二的動機，是在那種社會上，無法再生活下去，不得不另找出路。於是有些思想急進的份子，把他們組織起來，加以訓練。在當時那種專制的政治下，平民的政治活動是不容易的。所以組織和訓練，都帶了很濃厚的宗敎色彩，一面可以避免政府的耳目，一面可以擴大宣傳。並且張角之流，都是知識階級，對於宣傳組織，計劃一定很好，所以十餘年間，徒衆至數十萬，自青徐國冀荊揚兗　八州之人，都起來響應。「中平元年春，張角自稱黃天，其部師有三十六萬，皆着黃巾，同日反叛。安平甘陵人各執其王以應之。」這勢力可真不小，比起臧否人物的學生運動來，真是不可同日而語了。結果農民　抵不住政府軍，不到一年，他們的領袖張角張梁張實都送了命，表面似首是政府得了勝，其實不然的。幾個領袖的死亡，並不能消滅羣衆的力量。他們的力量，在全國各處繁殖。史書上說：「張角亂後，盜賊並起，不可勝數。大者二三萬，小者六七千人。」到黑山賊張飛燕起來，號稱百萬，聲勢最盛。政府看見這種嚴重的形勢，知道單用武力是不能解決的。結果是給張飛燕一個官作，那一大批羣衆，都收編爲常備軍了。還有無數小股的黃巾餘衆，政府又派兵去打了多少年，可是愈打愈多，後來還是會操出來，招安了事。「得戎卒三十餘萬，男女百餘萬口，這數目真有點驚人。這麼多的羣衆，在社會上失了衣食的根據，暴動起來，實在是嚴重的社會問題，專用剿匪的方法去對付，自然是無法解決的。不過自古以來，中國的歷史上統治階級都是執迷不悟，歡喜用這套走不通的方法。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，讀書人反映出來的思想，自然只有兩方面。表現於政治的是賞罰嚴明整飭綱紀的法治主義；表現於人生觀的，是保性全真　光義晦的道家哲學了。我們試看當代號稱儒家的仲長統崔實和徐幹之流，在他們的著作裏，都濃厚地表現了這兩種色彩。一方面言失政，一方面言道學。當時政治那麼黑暗，就是那些外戚宦官的罪惡。所以仲長統憤慨地說：「政不分於外戚之家，權不入於宦堅之門，下無侵門之吏，京師無侫邪之臣。則天神可降，地祇可出。」（　書治要昌言）如果有了貪官污吏，魚肉百姓，那就應該用刑法。所以他又說：「至於革命之期，非征代用兵，則不能定其業。姦冗之成羣，非嚴刑峻法，則不能破其黨。」崔實也是一位儒家，平日老是一套王政德敎的理論，後來看了當時的政治，覺得也非法治不可了。他說：「刑罰者治亂之藥石也，德敎者興平之梁肉也。」（羣盡治要政論）並且他還反對赦免，他覺得赦免，反足以加多犯罪的行爲。到了徐幹的「中論」，說明法治對於當時政治的重要性，更是明白。在「賞罰</p>
<p>」一篇裏，說得極其透澈。這種政治思想的要求，在當時一定非常普遍，所以曹操一當權，就實行嚴格的法治主義。不過他這種法治，並沒有把當時的政治　　，只是加重了對於文士的壓迫，剝奪了言論自由，孔　彌衡劉楨之流，因此都吃了大虧·於是　　份子，在那種狀態下，只好少談政治，甚至於不談政治，多談玄理·魏晋的清談，就在這種狀態下，發展興盛起來的。</p>
<p>上面說過，漢來的儒家，因爲當時政治的混亂，都　了濃厚的法家思想，但在那種屠殺初壓迫的狀態下，人生哲學，都趨向老荘方面去。徐幹　一面攻撃老荘　異端，一面大談其卑弱自守的養身術。仲長統在他的著作裏，鋒芒　露地敘述他的政治理想，但他的人生哲學，却是保性全　，　志樂命。有人勸他去做官，他說：「凡　帝王者，欲以立身　名耳。面名不常存，人生易滅，優遊　仰，可以自誤」。他的理想生治，是「安神開房思老氏之玄虛，呼吸精和求至人之彷每日，與達者數子論道講書，俯仰一樣，錯綜人物。彈南風之猚操，發清商之妙曲。消遙一世之上，脾　天地之間。不受當時之責，永保性命之期，如是可以陵　漢出宇宙之外矣。」（後漢書本傳）名不常　存，人生易滅，爭名奪利，有何意味。加以政治黑暗殺戳不絕。要保全性命，惟有卑弱自守，論道講書，隱水藏山，寄意荘老。這種人生哲學；也就是魏晋人士的人生哲學。因此當日明哲保身善處濁世的郭林宗，隔絕人世死在土穴的衰　，見機而作藏身樹的申屠蟠，成了當時人幹的楷模，而成爲高士傳中的高士了。</p>
<h3>彫刻在中國</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>彫刻在中國，具有悠久的歷史，因爲中斷了一個很長的時期，迄今還沒有恢復它的元氣。</p>
<p>秦漢以前，彫刻還沒有獨立的地位，僅僅是一種附屬的藝術。佛敎自印度傳到中國來時，方始才有彫刻的石像，而這種彫刻又多半是出於石匠之手，還說不上藝按的表現，不過中國之彫刻藝術從此就播下了可貴的種子而漸次發展起來。</p>
<p>我們看當時所遺留下來的作品及許多拓本揭片，如曲阜的魯王墓，高頤墓之石人石師子及各享堂廟宇中的碑碣。以題材而論，不外乎「忠孝節義」，「聖賢掌故」，「歌功頌德」，也有「戰爭塲面」。總之，百分之百是封建，道敎，宗法思想的產物。技術方面，如孝冊堂四壁的線刻，武氏祠的浮彫，車馬人物各種比例都較正確，而恣態之生動，刀法之流利，都是秦漢以前所未有都。然立體之石人石獅，全身各部之比例則差之甚遠，但，另具一種古樸裝飾之風。</p>
<p>及至三國，彫刻一無進步，遺物亦少。直到晉朝，佛敎再興，乃有大規模之造像。這時除去夾苧，金　（又名鎚　），石像之外，就有了鑄銅製作。於是五胡十六國中就有鏧窟造像之風。南北朝時，造銅佛像風氣更盛。南朝宋明帝，梁武帝倡鑄大銅佛，齊明帝之一千軀，梁簡文帝之一千軀，陳武帝之一百萬軀及金陵之七百寺，宣帝條治大佛一百三十萬軀……等等，皆可以看出當時工程之偉大，這是我國造像藝術空前的黃金時代。北朝，魏文成帝在大同雲崗武州山崖，鏧石窟五所，（後漸增至二十餘窟，）孝文帝都洛陽，又於龍門鏧石窟爲寺。更自宣武帝至孝明帝先後動用工人八十飯萬之衆化費二十四年的時間建造老君洞，賓陽洞等等，此皆可以看出當時我國彫刻興盛情形。齊之宮制中有「石窟丞」，是專司管理彫刻石像工程這職。由是更足以證明凡事經執政者之提倡，其成績必定　然的。</p>
<p>至於當時彫刻之　材爲什麼大多數限於佛像呢？一宮以蔽之，也就是因爲當時　　滿天下，使一般人民不得不將精神寄託在虛無的一神」的上面，人民祇有求福免災的一點兒　　，所以當政者也就針對着這一點，大造其成無境界以求民心。</p>
<p>至隋感，文帝即位也曾下詔修復佛寺，新造金銀檀香夾苧牙石等像約十餘萬軀，修治各地舊佛像約一百五十餘萬軀。　帝刻鑄銅佛像三千八百餘軀，修治舊像十萬餘……。有史可考者此時合計造像共二百萬一千又三十餘軀，其中最偉大者，高達一百三十餘尺，尚且還是從像。所化工程是如何艱巨，當可想見了。</p>
<p>唐承隋之後，直到盛唐末　，佛像之建造仍極與盛，其按巧與形式之凖步，大有淩駕前代之勢。以前彫刻工作者，已由早興，　僚，僕　　　一躍而興庶人平等了，雖仍無資格與士大夫駢肩。到了唐代，社會地位始逐漸增高，作者大名亦從此才有露面的機會，今可考而當時著名者，有楊惠之，宋法智，劉九郎，張仙喬……等。以上皆爲泥塑名匠。石刻作者有韓伯通，張壽，陳進……等。其塑像今日尤存者，如燉煌千佛嚴，吳之保聖寺，山東，河南，河北，甘肅等地亦有遺物存在。惜年久失修，加以天災人禍，毀環者多，保管者少，（據聞數年前曾有某軍閥以佛像之頭爲士兵扣練打靶，毀去不少）。故殘缺不堪，國家文化破產至如是地步，能不令人嘆息？</p>
<p>宋以後，彫刻藝術就慢慢衰落，迄至現在，雖再受西方的影響，使數千年古人爲我們播下的種子，漸次萌出幾根新芽，而當這脆弱的新芽正需人們加以培植的時候，偏偏遇到無情的暴風雨與敵騎的鐵蹄，將之蹂躪摧殘殆盡。彫刻！彫刻！你在中國的命運，何不幸至如是哉！</p>
<h3>我國書法為什麼是藝術？</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>我國書法之爲藝術，在國外藝術界裏加以討論的已很不少，在國內藝術界却不多討論。大家都已認定書法爲六藝之一，似乎也不必討論的了。但是，只知其然，不知其所以然，到底不是辦法。</p>
<p>從來我國講書法的書籍，着實不少，但所講的都是筆法以及書家等等，對於書法之爲藝術並不研究。像康有爲的續橄舟變楫，編輯的方法已經算是近代化了。但他只論到文字的起源，並沒有說到書法爲藝術的道理。抗戰前一、二年之時，杭州藝專有位敎授，在東南日報的副刊裏，發表了一篇書法非藝術論，引起了一大批的藝術家的忿怒，紛起責難。但爲書法辯護是藝術的美術家們，所說的都是枝枝節節，並沒有觸及根本問題。於是一塲繼續數月的討論，結果還是一塲混戰，弄得編輯先生沒有辦法，宣布停止辯論，以不了了之。書法爲什麼是藝術？在一般人的心中，到現在恐怕還是個問題。現在上海美術協會正在開展覽會，我想趁這機會，說一說我對於書法是藝術的意見。我覺得我國的書法的確是藝術。有許多外人說書法是抽象的藝術。我的意見恰恰相反，認爲書法是最爲具體的藝術。不過這種書法的藝術，只限於識字的人的。不識字的只當作一種圖書而已。</p>
<p>我們原來是萬有神論的信奉者，樣樣東西都是神。义字當然也是神。文字的產生，天雨粟，鬼夜哭，就是一個神話。一般人至今還非常重視文字，要敬惜字紙，就是因爲文字是神的綠故。書家賈字，照因果報應的說法，是沒有什麼好報應的，因其藝賣文字了。刻字匠雖刻文字，這好比將字的四肢來殺傷，更其冒犯文字的神聖，一定沒有的結果。張天師畫的符是神聖的，而符　實際就是議院的一體。</p>
<p>我國議院之爲神，實在毫無疑義。字典裏的字，便是一尊尊文字的偶像，議院神的具象化。我們寫字，就是將字典裏的一尊尊偶像來描盡而已。我國素來知道書畫同源的。其實我國書畫，不僅同源，就是到現在，一個個獨立的字，始終還是張圖象。我國的書又素來重神似，而不以形似爲貴的。所以寫字也以行楷爲藝術。善寫草書的甚至稱之爲草聖。寫規規矩矩的楷書反被人空瞧不起，這是從來已久，在唐宋時已如此的了。</p>
<p>寫字旣是描書一個個字的神像，寫字就是繪畫的一種，寫字自然是一種藝術了。我這個意見，究竟對不對，還待方家的指敎！</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（四四）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太碍　大家的面子，當時忍下去，可是到了晚上，宴席散了以後，回到自己屋裏，毫不留情地把　華大大訓了一頓。罵她不聽話就是不孝順，告訴她學戲就是學本事；並且恫嚇她，如果下次再這樣不懂事，便不要也這個女兒了。</p>
<p>華承受着　墨太太的責備，一聲不哼，唯有把眼淚往肚子裏飲泣！這是她自小養成的性格，她不言語，但她心裏有數。她雖然不過才九歲，但她像一個成熟的少女，她已經懂得了不少的人事。小的時候，是受墨老爺敎育的影響，近一兩年來，由于環境的變遷，在這種生活的逆流中，她又得到不少書本以外的活學問。加上她的天賦智慧，她能够辨識出是非與善惡。她明明知道墨太太如今所說的一切；所作的一切；都是不對的；不好的；然而她却不願去辯駁；因爲她也明知道「辯駁」等于零，墨太太不會聽她的話。還有墨太太究竟是她的母親，她念過「女兒經」。她爲了要遵守書上所敎導她的作人之道，她必須孝順！爲了要孝順，她便只有服從！爲了服從，她委屈自己，保持緘默。儘管這時她很怨尤，也很悲苦！</p>
<p>墨太太看見麗華臉上很難過的樣子，但又不哭，怕她摳出病來，反而破壞了自己的希望，和幻夢。於是又連忙轉就能態度，用和緩的口吻，帶哄帶威　地說：</p>
<p>「媽如今只有你這一個女兒了，你哥哥不孝順，我以後也不再理他了。只要你聽媽的話，總算我沒有白疼你一塲。媽叫你學戲，是爲的你好，俗語說得好好「藝不壓身」！你有了本事，不但自己長大了有出息，就是我老了也有個依靠！不然的話，咱們旣沒有家產；又沒有有錢有勢的親戚；將來怎麼辦呢？怕只有討飯了！」</p>
<p>這一派大道理，數落得麗華更是啞口無言了，也更感到嚴重的壓迫！使他稚弱的心靈，幾乎粉碎！她咬了咬牙，決定迎候那未來的劫運，與未來的無連黑暗！</p>
<p>「好啦！早點兒睡覺，明天早點兒起來。你師你說學戲練嗓子要在早晨最好，下半天再跟你右叔叔練工夫。」</p>
<p>墨太太歸後結束了今天不快的談判以後，他像一個勝利都，很妥恬地又回到虛榮的夢幻裏！</p>
<p>麗華差不多一夜沒睡着，她惶恐地憂懼着明天就要開始的生活！</p>
<p>第二天大清早，墨太太便把兩個小姊妹呌了起來。（如今麗雲仍舊跟着墨太太住）麗雲不似麗華想得那麼多，顧慮得那麼可怕。自然，也因爲她沒有麗華的智慧的原故。她對一切人事的看法，都極天真，單純。她的玩心還盛，她把學戲不過當作一種新鮮的遊戲罷了，所以她很高興。但當她發現麗華的一臉憂　時，她不禁託異了，她問麗華，麗華不理。她又想到也許還是爲了昨天的事，她得罪了麗華　麗華　了她。</p>
<p>「姐姐！就算我錯了行不行呢？你罵我也好，打我也好，只是別緊直不睬我呀！」麗雲央求地說。</p>
<p>麗華還是不開口。她不願說什麼，她知道說了麗雲也不會懂得。她深深地感到她和麗雲之間有着一個距離。</p>
<p>張弦來了，他帶着一頂黑緞子瓜皮帽，紅絲綫結的帽頂兒。穿着一件藍綾　袍，兩隻袖子高高地捲起，像要故意露出那天青色的綢裏子。脚上穿着一雙黑圈花緞子賀口鞋，雪白的絲襪子。別人看上去俗不可耐，他自己却洋洋得意，覺得挺美。一進門，先從腰間摘下那把隨身携帶的吃飯工具——胡　，謹慎地放到桌子上。然後，又自袖筒裏取出兩本手抄的戲　。擺出一副派頭十足的老師的尊嚴。這也是爲了他昨天丟了面子，今兒特地改變太度，想着給麗華個威風瞧瞧，好讓麗華以後怕他。</p>

<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 魯羽</p>
<p>遠別了九個年頭的故鄉，這次才從浙西趕到杭州，又搭上火車回來。到站後，從火車上跳下，望見了前面一片景色。啊！這便是我九年來朝夕懷念着的家鄕，不知怎樣，使我高興得幾乎在跳起來。</p>
<p>踏上了街，我連忙睜眼看着四週，覺得豎立在兩邊的那些陌生的舖子，又會使我疑心到這簡直已不像我從小生長的地方。當我迅速地走完了一條西街，拐了灣，便到了自己的家，我奔進鬥口，父親正坐在庭前抽着水烟，聽見脚步聲他才抬起頭來，起初還似乎向我投着一種陌生的眼光，等到我走近去，他才認淸了我的面目驚訝地說：</p>
<p>「阿新！你回來啦！戰事停了幾個月，你怎麽遲到現在才回家呢」？</p>
<p>「我早想回來了，最近才接到復員命令…………」我還沒有說完話，我的妹妹已經聽見聲音從裏面跑出來。可是她已經認不淸我是她的二哥哥了。</p>
<p>「品官比從前胖了。」我說着，一面携着她的手。</p>
<p>「小姑娘，二哥也不呌一聲，還認識嗎？傻子！」父親笑着說。</p>
<p>「怪不得她，我走時她她七歲，自然記不得了。」我說着，就同父親走進了客廳。</p>
<p>「媽在什麽地方？」我問父親。</p>
<p>「你媽早死了五年了……」父親指着壁上高懸着的那相片說。我起光倒還沒有注意到它，我這時聽了這個奇特的消息後，頓使神經發了麻木，手也覺得冰冷起來。我丟下手裏的那隻提箱，終於忍不住哭了出來。</p>
<p>「是什麽病？爲什麽信上始終沒有說起過？」我有點埋怨着父親說。</p>
<p>「那時你還在訓練，又不能够回來，吿訴你也徒然………」父親的二個深四地眼眶，早已顯出了紅紅的一圈。</p>
<p>夜飯時，除了二隻常菜外，父親又特地叫芸媽去添了一盆平時我最喜吃的鹹雞。可是，我心裏在想念着死去的母親；當我九年前離開這個家的時候，母親還陪笑着送到我門口這樣說：</p>
<p>「新！總巴望你以後爭氣阿來」。母親那副捨不得的慈祥的面孔，至今我還深刻地印在腦際。想不到現在我仍舊空着兩隻手回來，已不能再聞見我母親的音容。我心裏悲慘地暗自想着，「我太對不起死去的母親了。」雖然有着好菜，可是，我連一口飯都不能下嚥。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>上學</h3>
<p>— 張宛靑</p>
<p>我送孩子去上學，一走進校門，前面就是一片泥窪，不用說孩子發毛，速我也厭煩起來：「每天這個樣，—要是下雨，多麻煩！」</p>
<p>我貼着墻根把孩子舉過去，脚尖緊挨着墻，算沒有把衣服弄　，再看鞋跟上已踩上了一堆泥。我正要伏下身去拭，後面一個娘姨大聲的嚷起來：</p>
<p>「快一點呀，別人家阿要過去呵！—」</p>
<p>我向旁邊一讓，孩子的小褲上已呌墻根糊上了一塊泥。</p>
<p>「這是個什麼破學校？我眞氣昏了，要知道是這麼個爛泥窪，說什麽我也不會把孩子送了來！」</p>
<p>「還不是爲了離家近，大人好省點功夫，一下雨，上海可有幾個學校不是爛泥窪呢？」</p>
<p>後面的一位太太也搭了腔。</p>
<p>我們前呼後擁的一大串，好容易把自己的小心肝都送進了課堂。那課堂很窄，地板塌下去，小椅子只有五六十把，學生倒收了一百多。兩個先生忙得滿頭大汗，剛把一個學生按在座上，另一個又立起來跑了。</p>
<p>「吳媽，快點去捉進來呀！」那光生吩咐着。</p>
<p>「喲！劉丙生怎麽也不見了？」另一個先生在照着上課證上査人。</p>
<p>「媽，媽，我要回去呀，我要回去呀！」穿紅毛線衣的小女孩子扯着一個胖女人的旗袍角。</p>
<p>「姐姐呀，姐姐呀，姐姐上那兒去了呀？」一個約摸有五六歲的小男孩子坐在小椅子上哀哀的哭，脖子上掛了個大的新書包。</p>
<p>「等一會我就來接你，好好的聽先生的話！」親說時懷裏還抱了個週歲多點的孩子。「眞沒辦法，孩子太多，看不了，學校裏到底還能關他幾個鐘頭，—在家裏，一霎眼的功夫就跑到馬路上去了。」</p>
<p>「吳媽，吳媽，快拿隻面盆來呀！」</p>
<p>「喲，面盆不够，胸桶呢？」</p>
<p>「喲，這裏也漏了，都打在我的頭上了，快點，快點，快，不拘什麽都行！」</p>
<p>「什麽也沒有了，只有馬桶—是小學生們撒尿的？」</p>
<p>「行，行，行，快點拿來！」</p>
<p>人聲雨聲，混成了一片，屋上的雨都飄　進了窗，門外的水都流進屋子裏來。課堂內立刻震成了河，孩子們不哭了，都拍手笑着。</p>
<p>我抱了孩子在雨裏衝了出去，兩隻脚都陷在泥裏，九千元的學費我算白扔了，和孩子生了一塲病，兩星期後才好，我再不送孩子去上學了。</p>
<p>「可不是麽，我們家的六順兒也是一樣，因爲這個樣，連老媽子也不高興在我們家做了，她們說，到那裏做不是一樣？您這兒，連吃飯都得往街上轉幾個灣。……」一位北方太太也在那裏高聲的說。</p>
<p>「呵，爸爸呀！……像一頭要宰的小猪一樣，尖着嗓子追出去。在院裏，他圍着爸爸直打轉，先生也跟出來，直捉。先生往左，他躱在右邊，先生往右，他藏在左面，爸爸氣得打了他一個耳光：「沒出息的東西！」</p>
<p>「咦？這孩子怎麼撒了一地的尿，吳媽，吳媽，快點來呀！一另一個光生在討救兵。</p>
<p>「大家一齊來捉迷藏，一二三四………報名呀，咦，老學生怎麼也不幹了？」</p>
<p>孩子滿地的跑，兩位先生，一個娘姨，運足了氣力，各自大顯神通：</p>
<p>「坐下，坐下，起來，起來，……」</p>
<p>家長們是啦啦隊兼糾察兼評判人。</p>
<p>「喲，你怎麽啦？」那呌六順兒的上到先生的風琴上了。</p>
<p>「下來，下來，快下來呀，……」光生過去抱了下來。</p>
<p>六順兒不服，鳴的一聲哭了</p>
<p>「……姆媽呀……」一個小女孩子的脚蹈在地板縫裏去了。</p>
<p>「地板也不肯修，學費可不能少的！」母親叨叨着，很命把孩子從地板縫裏拉了上來，兩位光生都紅了臉，瞅着她，一句話也沒說。</p>
<p>鬧着鬧着的，門外的雨又落下來，淅瀝瀝的，直濺到課堂裏來。</p>
<p>雨越下越大，屋頂上也有了聲音，樸樸樸樸………。</p>
<h3>聾啞孩子的敎育</h3>
<p>— 日熹</p>
<p>我國無可否認的還在貧困的階段，在敎育還沒有普及之前，我們富然不能好高驚遠，來談聾啞學校應如何創辦，如何設備等問題，這些好像並不是當務之急，但我們不是造物者，不能因無聾啞學校，而禁止聾啞孩子的出世，亦不能視他們出世後，而任他們無敎育渡過一生。爲了聾啞孩子先天或後犬的不幸，每個做母親的都應負起敎育他們的責任；在這裏我們不妨看看美國牛門太太自己擔起敎育她聾啞子女的事實經過。</p>
<p>牛門太太是個救授的妻子，家境平常，但不幸得很，她先後所生的四個子女，皆是天生的聾子，所有的親戚朋友們，都勸她把他們送到聾啞學校去但她沒有依言而行，她心中另打一主意，即自己來敎育他們。她敎那些聾啞的孩子們看嘴唇如何顫動，辨別所發的是什麽音，怎樣說出這個音來。她謝絕了所有不必要的應酬，專心去敎育她的不幸的子女。</p>
<p>她以為如孩子們發音失敗，她應負失敗的責任，那並不是孩子們的過失。孩子們在五六歲時，即開始特殊的敎育。她敎每一個單字的時候，不憚其煩的，一次重復一次的唸，甚至要唸四五十次，叫孩子們注意她的嘴唇，爲了增强孩子們的興趣，牛門太太時常想出與說話有關係的遊戲，叫孩子們練習說話。當他們有進步時，她再教他們別的生字</p>
<p>這時期中，牛門太太的家裏曾遭過一次火災，差不多所有的東西都完了。但這並沒有减低她的信心，頽傷他的意志，她仍努力敎育她的子女，結果四個孩子都能說話，雖然仍舊聽不出任何聲響。但他們長大後，一個成了州樂家，一個成了美術家，一個成了作家，一個還在大學攻讀牙科；這種學問上的成就與牛門太太的鼓勵培養，實有密切的關係</p>
<p>在這地方我們可以看出：一個母親的決心及毅力，對於孩子們幸福有極大的影響，而敎育設備的好壞倒反次之。希望母親們對不幸的聾啞孩子們。試試牛門太太的方法及精神看。</p>

<h3>Chairman and Wife Return to the Capital: Stopover in Jinan for Four Hours; Address to Various Troops After Lunch</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, returned to the capital at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. The Chairman left Beijing on May 24th and, in the past ten days, inspected Beiping, Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife and entourage, departed at 10:40 AM on the 3rd to return to the capital by air. The Chairman arrived in Beiping on the 30th of last month and stayed for ninety hours.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] During his ninety hours in Beiping, Chairman Chiang inquired about various departments and aspects. Previously, Madame Chiang visited the most prosperous Dong'an Market in Beiping to subtly inquire about business conditions and the people's livelihood. Yesterday evening, after 7:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, traveled lightly to the San Beizi Garden in the western suburbs. Mayor Xiong invited famous Beiping opera singers to perform, and the Chairman specifically requested an additional performance of the play "Hua Rong Dao," in which Guan Yunchang magnanimously releases Cao Cao. During the Chairman's stay in Beiping, all aspects appeared orderly and active, and prices also showed a decline. However, citizens are worried about whether prices will rise again after the Chairman leaves, as they did last time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Chairman Chiang received all members of the Hebei Provincial Government and Chairman Feng Qin-zai of Chahar Province at his official residence at 9:00 AM on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Jinan on the 3rd while returning to the capital from Beiping. Due to time constraints, they stayed in Jinan for less than four hours and were unable to enter the city to receive the welcome of 800,000 citizens. The Chairman and his wife arrived in Jinan at 12:40 PM on the 3rd aboard a C-54 large aircraft. Chief of Staff of the Jinan Garrison and Deputy Director Wang Shuming arrived earlier in two separate planes with the security personnel. Party, government, and military leaders, including Wang Yaowu and He Siyuan, greeted them at the airport, and the Air Force Headquarters near the airport was used as the temporary headquarters. After disembarking, the Chairman and his wife went to the temporary headquarters to rest, then had lunch accompanied by the heads of various agencies. After lunch, they summoned senior and mid-level officers from various units for a briefing. Subsequently, they met separately with He Siyuan, Pang Jingtang, Pei Mingzong, Zang Yuanjun, and officers above the rank of division commander from various units. Upon hearing the news, Deng Weisi, Hao Jinsi, and Barrow, the three American representatives of the Jinan Executive Group, rushed to request an audience. Madame Chiang received them on behalf of the Chairman. At 4:10 PM, the Chairman and his wife left the temporary headquarters for the airport. Before boarding, the Chairman took group photos with various senior generals as a memento. At 4:25 PM, they boarded the plane and left Jinan to return to the capital. It had long been rumored that the Chairman and his wife would be coming to Jinan. On the morning of the 3rd, the entire city hung flags, and citizens spontaneously lined the streets to welcome them all day long, dispersing only after the Chairman and his wife left Jinan.</p>
<h3>Capital Commemorates Anti-Smoking Day: Chairman Issues Instructions Encouraging the Eradication of the Great Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly was held this morning, presided over by Mayor Ma. The new Chief of Police, the Director of the Health Bureau, and over two thousand citizens attended. After speeches by the Chairman and other officials, a Jingyun Dagu performance entitled "Eradicating Opium and New Life" was presented. Afterwards, the confiscated opium and related paraphernalia were burned in the square. From September of last year to March of this year, a total of 64.2 taels of opium and 249 pieces of paraphernalia were seized. In addition, opium and related items handed over by the former puppet capital's District Court Prosecutor's Office were burned. The fierce flames soared into the sky, and onlookers shouted slogans. The fire was not extinguished by the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] On the 3rd, Chairman Chiang issued the following instructions to the Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly in the capital: "Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, Director Wang of the Anti-Smoking Committee, and all those attending the Anti-Smoking Day Assembly, this year's Anti-Smoking Day Commemorative Assembly is being held after the victory of the War of Resistance and the government's return to the capital. Its significance is profound and surpasses the ordinary. Our purpose in resisting aggression and building the nation is to seek the independence and self-reliance of the country and the nation. Now that the task of resisting aggression is difficult to call complete, and the task of nation-building has only just begun, our nation will soon strive to forge ahead to shoulder an even more arduous task. Strengthening the physical constitution of the people and enhancing the health of the nation are the most urgent requirements at this time. Looking back, the scourge of opium has plagued our country for a century and has long been a great enemy to the survival and development of our nation. The government's six-year anti-smoking policy before the war was unfortunately thwarted by the enemy's invasion. Especially in the occupied areas, the enemy's poisoning conspiracy against our compatriots was extremely sinister and ruthless, employing every possible means. Although the government was determined to ban opium, its authority was insufficient to do anything about it. Now, fortunately, the lost territory has been recovered, and all conditions are in place to carry out the unfinished work before the war and sweep away the poison left by the enemy. This is the government's inescapable responsibility. All our compatriots must also be keenly aware of the difficulty of obtaining freedom, strive for the vitality of a new life, and abstain from harmful contamination in order to achieve the reality of a strong nation and a strong people. If opium cannot be eradicated in a single day, it will be no different from the enemy occupying our land for a single day. Not only will the nation's life continue to be eroded, but the task of nation-building will not be able to begin, and there will be no way to face the spirits of the Founding Father and the virtuous martyrs in heaven, or the expectations of friendly nations towards us. Therefore, the government will concentrate all its efforts to completely eradicate this great enemy in the shortest possible time. All areas under government authority must complete the ban within six months after the government's authority is fully established, and no more opium must be found. In remote areas, where the people often privately cultivate opium poppies to make illegal profits, strict attention must be paid to investigation and eradication, without the slightest negligence. In short, the government regards opium, whether it is cultivated, transported, sold, or smoked, as a public enemy of our people and will impose severe penalties without the slightest leniency. Government officials at all levels should be aware of the importance of their anti-smoking responsibilities, which are not only related to the success of their political achievements but also to their inherent duties. If they fail to enforce the ban and allow opium to flourish, they will not only be unable to escape the sanctions of the law but will also be condemned by conscience and the world. It is hoped that those who understand the greater good will repeatedly advise their relatives and friends to strictly abide by the ban and not violate it in any way. Together, we must uphold the spirit of eliminating the poison and strive to achieve the practical effect of removing old habits, so that the atmosphere of the nation will be transformed, and international opinion will be renewed. This is our great hope. Chiang Chung-cheng."</p>
<h3>Guangdong to be Divided into Three Parts</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 3rd] Official news: The plan to divide Guangdong Province into three parts to improve the efficiency of administrative management has been approved by Chairman Chiang.

<h3>Chen Cheng Attends Central Memorial Week: Reports on the Advantages of the New Military System and Explains the Situation in the Northeast in Detail</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Over 350 officials from various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions attended. Deputy Director Zhou Zhong of the Examination Yuan presided over the ceremony. After leading the attendees in paying their respects, the newly appointed Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng, delivered a report. He first stated that the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense was an epoch-making reform in the history of China's military building and that this new military system was extremely suitable for China's current environment. He then analyzed the current military and political steps being implemented in China: (1) The implementation of the military reorganization plan should be carried out step by step according to the government's established policy. (2) The establishment of the new Ministry of National Defense will establish a new military system with the following advantages: (A) The military will be controlled by the government, achieving the goal of returning the military to the nation. (B) The command of the army, navy, and air force will be unified, achieving military unity. Certain characteristics can be listed: First, the government has power, and the military has ability. By using power to control ability, the military can fully exert its capabilities. Second, the three-linked system of government administration is coordinated. At this point in his report, Chen also reported on the handling of enemy and puppet military supplies that had been received. Finally, he gave a detailed explanation of the war situation in the Northeast.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The situation in Tai'an is extremely critical, and a major battle is imminent. Because there is no room for mediation in the Tai'an situation, the members of the Tai'an group have already flown back to Jinan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 3rd] Since occupying Longkou, the Communist troops have emptied all materials and important machinery, and the electricity company has also been demolished.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] The Communist troops occupied the Jiaozuo coal mine, and there is a coal shortage in northern Henan. The Huayuankou blockage and reconstruction project has also recently experienced power problems due to insufficient coal. The Engineering Bureau is currently borrowing coal from the Pinghan Railway Bureau to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Far East Regional Committee to Open in the Capital on the 7th; China's Relief Issues Will Be the Focus of Discussion; Representatives and Advisors from Various Countries Have Arrived in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] As the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee is about to convene, Director-General of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), Chiang Yen-shih, is scheduled to arrive in the capital by train from Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd to provide instructions on various preparatory matters before the meeting. The disaster relief sketches recently made by painter Situ Qiao in the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan will also be exhibited in Beijing on the opening day of the meeting to provide the representatives of various countries with reference when discussing the distribution of relief supplies for the coming year. The agenda of the Far East Regional Committee meeting has not yet been fully drafted. What is known so far is that Director-General Chiang will chair the meeting, and Director of the UNRRA Far East Office and Chief of the UNRRA Mission to China, Mr. Raper, will be the Secretary of the Conference. The work of UNRRA in the Far East and issues related to China's post-war relief and rehabilitation will be the main topics of discussion at the meeting.

The opening ceremony will be held at the International Club at 10:30 AM on the 7th, and journalists will be allowed to attend. All other discussions will be conducted in secret.

The list of representatives from New Zealand, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire, Restoration of Roads, and Implementation of Military Reorganization are Urgent Needs for the Entire Country; Zhou Enlai Visited Marshall Yesterday for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] There is much speculation about the political trends after Chairman Chiang's return to the capital. However, according to a well-informed source here, the government's established policy will not change due to the new situation in the Northeast. The concern is that after the Communist Party's setbacks in the Northeast, it has obviously rehashed its old tune of "full ceasefire" and "sincere consultation," while secretly taking advantage of this gap to carry out new military deployments. Even in the Northeast, two months later, the green crops will provide favorable conditions for the Communist troops to harass. Therefore, while the government's door to peace talks remains open, lessons learned from the past suggest that this kind of tolerance has a maximum limit. Even during this waiting period, the military will change from its past passive defense to an active defense. The experiences of Sipingjie and Changchun, which only caused suffering to the people and depleted the country's strength, have forced the government to take this step.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Today, the newly appointed Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, in his report on the military situation in the Northeast at the Central Memorial Week, after analyzing the battle situation in Sipingjie, expressed his personal views on national affairs with a resolute tone, saying that he would never oppose a peaceful solution to the Northeast problem, nor would he oppose any party's request for a ceasefire, nor would he oppose resolving the current disputes through political consultations. However, the above-mentioned methods must have a definite time limit, because the people really cannot afford to wait. A real ceasefire and the restoration of transportation are urgent needs for the entire country. The full implementation of the military reorganization plan should also be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 3rd and talked with him at length until 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Song Ziwen and Zhang Qun also held separate talks with Li Huang and Liu Dongyan of the Youth Party and representatives of the Democratic League. Lei Zhen returned to the capital on the morning of the 3rd. According to him, Chen Qitian, Hui Qi, and Chang Naiying of the Youth Party are scheduled to come to the capital this Thursday to attend the resident committee meeting of the National Political Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Democratic League Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, and representatives of social figures Mo Dehui, visited Li Huang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, on the 3rd in the morning and afternoon to exchange views on the current domestic situation. It is also learned that Chen Qitian, a representative of the Youth Party, is scheduled to come to the capital on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Yang Chuo'an Arrives in Beiping: Will Transfer to Shenyang in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] As the Nationalist troops in the Northeast are advancing rapidly towards Harbin, Mayor of Harbin Yang Chuo'an has been conducting his circuitous travels along the complex lines of diplomacy and internal affairs for the past month. On April 25th, Yang and others bid farewell to Harbin under the pressure of the Communist troops and withdrew into Soviet territory in Vladivostok with the Soviet army. At the end of last month, he returned to the country by boat and arrived in Shanghai. Today, he flew from Shanghai to Beiping and will transfer to Shenyang in two or three days. If the Nationalist troops recently stationed in Harbin, then Yang will return to Harbin, which he bid farewell to months ago, as geometrically depicted. This reporter visited Yang at the old site of the Zhengjin Bank at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. According to him, the withdrawal of central personnel from Harbin was extremely orderly. Before leaving, the city government handed over political power to the city council (the chairman of the council is He Zhian, and there are two vice-chairmen). Each central receiving agency clearly explained and entrusted responsible persons before leaving. The agencies, schools, and hospitals all issued one month's salary in advance because even if government personnel withdrew, children could not be deprived of their education, and people could not be deprived of medical care. At that time, the Communist troops had already entered the city, but because they tried to avoid anything that could cause bloodshed, he dealt with them frankly, and no unfortunate incidents occurred. On April 25th, the 80 people of the Harbin Songnen receiving personnel and the military delegation openly took more than ten cars to the station at 2:00 PM that afternoon and took a train with the Soviet army to withdraw, arriving in Vladivostok after a two-day journey. The military delegation led by Dong Yanping returned to Kuan Chengzi and transferred to a train to Khabarovsk to continue working at the Soviet military headquarters. They stayed at a sanatorium by the sea in Vladivostok for more than 20 days, waiting for a ship. Yang said: The Soviet Union treated them very well on the way to the Soviet Union and in Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Communist Army in Eastern Hubei Transported to Handan</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] According to the decision of the Military Tripartite Executive Headquarters, over a thousand wounded and sick soldiers of the Communist army in eastern Hubei were transported to Handan. The train arrived in Handan at the end of May.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Broadcast Instructions to the Youth Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Youth Expeditionary Force (except for soldiers of the 207th Division who voluntarily extended their service) began to be demobilized in June. Chairman Chiang specifically broadcast instructions to the soldiers of each division of the army at 9:00 PM on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>All soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army Youth Expeditionary Force, you have been enlisted for over a year. During this year, our country has undergone arduous struggles and achieved the final victory of the War of Resistance. The term of service for our Youth Expeditionary Force soldiers is also coming to an end. At this time of demobilization, I want to especially tell all our officers and soldiers, you should earnestly reflect on your experience in training in this army over the past year. What have you learned? What is the relationship between this training and your future career prospects? What kind of contributions should you make to the country and the revolution in the future? Before you are demobilized, you must have a detailed study and understanding of these issues, so that you will not fail the aspirations of your enlistment and training this time.</p>
<p>Since you responded to the call of this Committee Chairman and joined the revolutionary ranks at the end of the previous year when the War of Resistance was at its most critical, during this year or more of your enlistment, you have certainly made great progress in military knowledge and skills, and the training you have received in your life and actions is particularly important. This is a most valuable kind of training that cannot be obtained in other ordinary schools and in society. As long as you can follow this training you have already received, continue to practice it unceasingly, consistently, and strive for self-improvement after demobilization, in any national system, you will certainly be able to succeed in your career and become a leader of the people, and you will not be unworthy of being a cadre for revolutionary nation-building.</p>
<p>Everyone must know that the failure of our Chinese general school education in recent years is due to the failure to pay attention to life training. General teachers and students regard the order of life and the discipline of action as unimportant, thinking that students only need to pass the subject scores. They think that the quality of young students' life actions and character is irrelevant. However, it is not known that it is precisely because of this reason that we have ruined the future careers of our young people and lost the endless life of our nation. Therefore, if we want to build the nation in the future, we must first establish the foundation for nation-building, especially the foundation of our national intellectual youth. Only when young people have a sound foundation can the nation have life. What is the foundation of youth? It is his orderly life, habits, and organized consistent actions. In other words, it is the public morality necessary for modern citizens, the social order and group discipline that everyone should observe. It must be so, so that every citizen can know how to respect social order and group discipline, and can automatically, autonomously, help each other, cooperate, be self-reliant, and strive for self-improvement, be selfless, and then can achieve our goal of establishing a modern nation with independence and equality. The value of military training lies in this, because in addition to military knowledge and technology, the most important thing in the army is the development of group life, and group life pays special attention to discipline and order. Everyone must know that the order of life and the discipline of action can be said to be the basic conditions for each of us to succeed in our careers. Not only should we pay attention to them in the army, but even after demobilization, wherever we go in society or schools, as well as in the agricultural, industrial, economic, township, baojia, and various levels, we must maintain this characteristic of life, value order, abide by discipline, be automatic, autonomous, self-reliant, and strive for self-improvement. Then we can serve as a model for the general public and exert the leading role of one as ten, and one as a hundred. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>US Military Headquarters in China Not to be Withdrawn Temporarily at the End of June; Gillern Says Scope to be Reduced as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Lieutenant General Gillern, Commander of the US Military Headquarters in China, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: (1) The US Military Headquarters in China will not be withdrawn at the end of June this year, but its scope will be reduced as much as possible and will change with the environment. In the near future, there will be no major changes in the US Military Headquarters. In the second half of 1946, the US Military Headquarters will have about 4,000 personnel. He also said: The US Department of the Army has begun preparing to transport the families of US military personnel who will be working in China to China. The first batch may arrive in September of this year. The number is not yet determined. They will bring all kinds of furniture and daily necessities with them because prices in Shanghai are too high, and the US military cannot afford them. The US military authorities are planning in detail the housing and children's education issues for the US military families after they arrive in China. (2) The reporter also asked about the progress of the repatriation of Japanese residents. General Gillern replied: All Japanese residents in North China have been evacuated. A very small number who are still in North China will also be sent back to their country in the coming days. As for the repatriation of Japanese residents in the Nine Northeastern Provinces, it has only recently begun. There are no statistics at the same time. In addition, the instability in the Northeast is an obstacle and an influence. Therefore, the number of Japanese residents in the Northeast who are being repatriated each month is an (uncertain) statistic. (3) General Gillern has previously denied the accusation of a certain newspaper that US aircraft are assisting the National Army. He reiterated the mission of the US military in China, saying that the US military has been ordered to absolutely prohibit participation in any side's war and to avoid involvement in the disputes between the Nationalists and the Communists in order to avoid fueling the war. Finally, General Gillern said that the US military's policy in China is based on the US government, and he himself has no right to express any opinions. As for whether the US policy will change if the war in China continues, he is unable to express any opinion.</p>

<h3>Arch-Traitor Cannot Escape National Law, Chen Gongbo Executed by Firing Squad in Suzhou, Bids Farewell to Fellow Traitors Chen and Chu Before Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman of the puppet Nationalist government, was executed by firing squad in the Third Prison this morning. At 7:30 AM, Prosecutor Li Shudong of the Suzhou High Procuratorate, accompanied by Recorder Wang Xuefan, led seven bailiffs including Chief Police Officer of Suzhou to the Third Prison in Shizi Street by car at 8:00 AM. A temporary court was set up in an empty room in the prison. Warden Chen Songnian sent Chief Guard Hua Ruiting to cell number one in the Character block with four guards to deliver the final verdict of the Supreme Court to the traitor Chen Gongbo and ordered him to imprint his fingerprints on the original. Chen had just finished breakfast and was writing a couplet for the chief guard. He had just written the last two characters "bright moon" of the second line when he was taken to the temporary court. At this time, Chen did not know he was about to be executed. He was wearing a short, gray, black-striped woolen jacket and trousers, gray thread socks, and black woven single shoes. Seeing bailiffs standing everywhere in the court and the prosecutor sitting upright behind the desk, he realized that death was imminent. However, his attitude remained extremely calm. In a tone of complete indifference, he said, "I understand. It's today, isn't it? Let me go back and put on a long gown. It'll look better." So he turned and returned to his cell, placed the watch, money, pen and other small items from his pockets on the bed, changed into new black thread socks and half-new black half-high pointed leather shoes, and put on a blue-gray Shilin cloth long gown. He calmly shook hands with Chu Minyi, his neighbor in the next cell, and they said goodbye to each other. He also met Chen Bijun in the women's prison, shook her hand and told her of his impending death. Finally, he instructed that a glass mouthwash cup for daily use must be buried with him. After these instructions, he returned to the temporary court, held onto the edge of the desk with both hands, and leaned forward to listen quietly to the final interrogation. After Prosecutor Li asked about his age and origin, he asked if he had any last words to be conveyed to his family. Chen replied, "I don't know where my family is. I have no last words." Prosecutor Li pointed to a small table nearby and said that if he had any documents to leave behind, he could sit down and write them. Chen replied, "I have a petition to Chairman Chiang, which is one-third completed. But to finish it would take three hours. I would feel uneasy to make you all sit and wait for so long for my sake. Besides, it seems unnecessary now." Then he smiled and shook hands with Prosecutor Li and Recorder Wang, saying "Goodbye." When the bailiffs wanted to tie him up, Chen smiled and asked them to dispense with it, saying, "No need for that. Let me have some dignity." He pointed to Ju Hongfan of the police bureau, who was standing next to him with a gun, and said, "You are the executioner, aren't you? Please be quick about it and don't make my face look too ugly." After speaking, he strode towards the wasteland behind the prison, which was the execution ground. He stood upright in the center of the execution ground, facing north and with his back to the south. Prosecutor Li, Recorder Wang, and Warden Chen all came to the site to supervise. At 8:30 AM, the execution order was given. Chen closed his eyes and tilted his head slightly to the side. Executioner Zhou Hongfan stood more than two feet away from Chen and fired a shot, which hit the back of his head and exited through his right cheek. Chen fell to the ground, first with his buttocks, then backwards. Thus, an arch-traitor who brought disaster to the country was punished by national law and met his demise. The following is a list of his belongings: a briefcase, a thermometer, a spirit lamp, a leather handbag, a wooden comb, a razor, a yellow and white fleece blanket wrapped in clothes, a shaving brush and bowl set, a package of books, a white sheet and blanket wrapped in bedding, two washbasins, two small scissors, two thermos bottles, a nail clipper, other miscellaneous items, and several tens of thousands of dollars in cash. The reporter also read his final judgment, which consisted of three parts. One was a reply to Li Lizhuang, and the other two were replies to Zhao Yuehan and Liu Tianyou, who resided in Shanghai. These are recorded separately below. The relationship between Zhao, Liu, and Chen remains a mystery. Chen's body is temporarily kept in the prison examination room. The prison has notified his servant Liu Tongchen, who resides at 65 Shicui Street, to inform Chen's family to come to Suzhou to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court's Secondary Judgment</h3>
<p>Supreme Court Special Criminal Judgment, Year 35, Jing Te Fu No. 129</p>
<p>Appellant: Chen Li Lizhuang, female, wife of Chen Gongbo, age 50, resident of 25 Ninghai Road, Nanjing.</p>
<p>Defendant: Chen Gongbo, male, age 55, resident of 64 North Beiping Road, Nanjing.</p>
<p>The above-named defendant was convicted of treason. The Jiangsu Provincial High Court rendered its decision on April 12th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the case was sent to this court for final review. The appellant also applied for review. This court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Original judgment affirmed.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The original judgment found that the defendant, Chen Gongbo, was originally a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party and a confidant of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, repeatedly holding important positions in the central government. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. The enemy forces were rampant, and Shanghai soon fell. The capital was shaken. The National Government decided to fight a protracted war and moved west to Chongqing to plan a counteroffensive. The traitor Wang Zhaoming violated the established national policy and willingly accepted the use of the Japanese chieftain Konoe Fumimaro to secretly negotiate peace. The defendant was forced to follow Wang in participating in the deliberations. At Wang's invitation at the end of the 27th year, he went from Chengdu to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue discussing the peace movement. Wang drafted a peace telegram, which was given to the defendant and Zhou Fohai to be published in Hong Kong to respond to Konoe's proposed three principles of peace, hoping to confuse the public and obstruct the central government's war effort. Wang then went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic peace plan with the Japanese invaders and establish a puppet regime. The defendant shuttled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, constantly participating in the matter. When the basic negotiations were finalized, on March 30th of the 29th year, they jointly organized the puppet Nationalist government in Nanjing. Wang became the puppet chairman, and the defendant became the puppet president of the Legislative Yuan. In May of the same year, he led a delegation to Japan in the name of a puppet envoy to pay tribute. Later, he also served concurrently as the puppet mayor of Shanghai. Under the protection of the Japanese invaders, he openly and formally signed the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, recognizing Manchukuo to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders, and in January of the 32nd year, he agreed in the name of the puppet Nationalist government to declare war on our allies, Great Britain and the United States, and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese invaders. Later, he visited Japan in the name of a puppet ambassador. In March of the following year, Wang went to Japan for medical treatment, and the defendant acted as the puppet chairman of the Nationalist government and the puppet chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, from which the military and political power of the puppet government was solely under his control. After Wang's death, he formally acted as puppet chairman and concurrently served as the puppet president of the Executive Yuan. In his capacity as puppet head of state, he visited the Japanese emperor, expressing that he would continue Wang's legacy, live and die with the Japanese invaders, and complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War. Because the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled in fear of punishment and hid in Japan. He was ordered by telegram to be arrested and sent back to the country and taken to the court for prosecution. The evidence on which this is based is that the defendant and Wang Zhaoming jointly organized the puppet Nationalist government, held various important puppet positions, and succeeded Wang in leading the puppet government after Wang's death, monopolizing puppet power, occupying Nanjing, and issuing orders. His own confession is undeniable, and there are records of him presiding over meetings and handling official duties. In the puppet Shanghai Municipal Gazette, there are official documents issued by the defendant in his capacity as puppet mayor. It was separately discovered that the defendant, in the name of the puppet Nationalist government's acting chairman, appointed Chu Minyi as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and the puppet pacification director of Guangzhou, etc., which can be used as proof. Regarding how Wang told him about the secret peace plot with the Japanese invaders before leaving Chongqing, inviting him to go to Hanoi, Vietnam, to send a peace telegram to support the peace declaration of the enemy chieftain Konoe Fumimaro, and how he was summoned by Wang to Shanghai to negotiate the basic relationship treaty with the Japanese invaders, and how after the establishment of the puppet government, he went to Japan in the name of a puppet envoy to pay tribute and subsequently issued the "Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration," openly recognizing "Manchukuo," and how after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he declared war on Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet Nationalist government, and signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, repeatedly traveling to Japan to visit the enemy chieftain, declaring that he would live and die with them, his confession and statements in the original court are all detailed. Cross-referencing the "Record of the Puppet Nationalist Government Delegation's Visit to Japan," "Collection of Speeches of Chen Gongbo's Visit to Japan," "Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," published by the Puppet Propaganda Department, and the "Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet Nationalist Government," published by the Political Monthly Society, as well as the records in the "Puppet Shanghai Municipal Gazette" and the "Overseas News Clippings Book," are all consistent. The defendant colluded with Wang Zhaoming to conspire with the Japanese invaders, secretly negotiated peace, established a puppet regime, and openly betrayed the central government. The evidence of his treason is very clear. The defendant's defenses, including (1) that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified, so he did not agree with Wang's departure from Chongqing and the organization of the puppet government, and repeatedly tried to dissuade him without success, only because the relationship was too deep that he could not bear to leave abruptly, (2) that he always opposed the Sino-Japanese Basic Relationship Treaty, repeatedly requested its abolition, and interceded with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo, (3) that the peace negotiations with the Japanese invaders were to achieve overall peace, so he never had hostile behavior towards the Chongqing government, and although the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States, it did not actually send troops, and its purpose was only to avoid the Japanese invaders from plundering materials, and (4) that the people in the occupied areas suffered greatly, and in the gazette of the puppet Legislative Yuan, the defendant, in his capacity as the puppet president, was provided with the opportunity to rescue them by the puppet government. The vitality of the country depends on...</p>

<h3>Traitor Chu Minyi to be Executed Immediately Upon Arrival of Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Regarding the Supreme Court's confirmation of the death sentence for the traitor Chu Minyi on the 26th of last month, he was transferred to the Third Prison in Shizi Street yesterday along with the traitor Chen Gongbo and placed under detention. He will be executed by firing squad as soon as the order arrives in Suzhou.</p>
<h3>The Arrest of the False Mayor of Jinan, Zhu Guishan, in Beiping; Tao Xisan, a Traitor, Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 3rd] Zhu Guishan, the false mayor of Jinan, was arrested in Beiping on the 28th of last month. After the victory, Zhu changed his name to Yuan Yan and hid in Lu's residence at No. 33 Zhufu Granary Street, Xiyu. The Preparedness Department detected him some time ago and made the arrest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch, 3rd] The case of Tao Xisan (protected), the head of the false Nanjing Local Maintenance Association, was announced by the Capital High Court at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The defendant was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for three years, and all assets were confiscated except for a discretionary amount for the necessary living expenses of his family. The traitor Tao is already nearing his twilight years, but it is said that he still protested and applied for retrial after hearing the verdict. He cited five reasons to maintain his innocence, including preserving a significant amount of wealth, and maintaining Nanjing's security after the Japanese surrender to await the arrival of the National Army, subsequently going to Japan to await orders, and not fleeing. However, the court stated regarding the first point that Wang Jingwei colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the central government. If, as the defendant claimed, he had tried to dissuade Wang in vain, he should have weighed the importance of the matter and decided on his course of action. Instead, the defendant responded to Wang's call and secretly went to Hanoi, where he sent a pro-peace telegram on Wang's behalf, and then jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing, assuming important positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position and held the highest provincial office, and on the 13th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, he broadcast a statement declaring his inheritance of Wang Jingwei's legacy, working closely with Japan and Manchukuo for mutual prosperity. This broadcast speech is evidenced by a record from an enemy radio station, which proves that the defendant abandoned righteousness for personal gain, sacrificing everything to engage in acts that forfeited national sovereignty and brought shame upon the country. Although he showed utmost loyalty to Wang Jingwei, he caused immense harm to the country and the nation. Furthermore, the defendant relied on the protection of the Japanese invaders and seized control of the southeast, which already formed a divided situation. He also organized the puppet Kuomintang and convened the Sixth National Congress, using it as a means of rallying support, which contradicted the idea that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified. Regarding the second point, according to the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, Japan had the right to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, station fleets in China's territorial waters, and carry out economic cooperation, allowing the Japanese invaders to infringe on sovereignty and plunder resources. The defendant himself knew that this was an unequal and harsh treaty, yet he agreed with Wang Jingwei to have it passed by the puppet Legislative Yuan, which he headed. This would have subjected China to their control and permanently reduced it to a Japanese appendage, sacrificing the country and the nation at any cost. Even if he had expressed opposition beforehand and requested a cessation afterward, he could not shirk responsibility. Moreover, after this basic treaty, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was subsequently signed, establishing an alliance with the enemy country, which became even closer and ran counter to the central government's policy of resistance against Japan, resulting in conflicting interests. Furthermore, the defendant initially issued a joint declaration with Wang Jingwei of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and later, on February 26th of the 34th year of the Republic, broadcast a celebration of the 13th anniversary of the founding of the puppet Manchukuo, consistently recognizing the existence of Manchukuo. The impact of this was sufficient to undermine the integrity of China's territory. He still argues tenaciously that he negotiated with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo, but who can believe it? Regarding the third point, the defendant agreed with Wang Jingwei to make peace with the Japanese invaders, which was far from the national policy of resisting Japan, and he also betrayed the central government and formed a puppet government. In the puppet Central Political Conference, it was resolved that "after the National Government returns to the capital, all domestic and foreign decrees, treaties, agreements, and contracts of Chongqing would be invalid, all troops should immediately cease fighting and await orders, and all civil servants should report to Nanjing within the shortest period." This is recorded in the book "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government." This resolution falsely claimed that "the National Government has returned to the capital" while denying the existence of the Chongqing government, clearly revealing its desire to eliminate the central government and usurp its position. The claim that there was never any hostile action against the Chongqing government is self-defeating. Furthermore, according to our country's established policy, we should unite with the British and American democratic front to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Japan, but the defendant and Wang Jingwei established a puppet regime and joined hands with the enemy country Japan, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. Their goal was to rely on the Axis powers, destroy Britain and America, and isolate our central government's resistance against Japan in order to achieve their traitorous plot, which is extremely clear. The claim that this was to resist the Japanese plunder of resources is also a deceptive statement. Regarding the fourth point, because the Japanese invaders lacked the ability to control the occupied areas, they created puppet governments for their own use, in order to achieve their goal of controlling China with Chinese and sustaining the war with war. After the defendant and Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government, they catered to the wishes of the Japanese invaders, and the corrupt policies implemented in the occupied areas, such as plundering resources, issuing counterfeit currency, selling opium through public monopolies, and enslaving the youth through village clearing and blockades, were all actions that harmed the country and the people. This can be seen in the files of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government obtained by the original court and the telegrams between the defendant and Chu Minyi seized in another case. All of the above were evil schemes originating from the Japanese invaders' political aggression, and the depth of the harm they caused was more than enough to destroy the country and exterminate the race. The defendant still claims to have rescued the people and preserved their vitality, which is the opposite of the truth. Regarding the fifth point, since the puppet government was a puppet organization, it lost its basis after the Japanese invaders surrendered and was bound to disintegrate at the same time. At that time, the Japanese General Okamura Neiji and others were awaiting orders in Nanjing, and before the National Army arrived, they should still abide by the surrender orders and be responsible for maintaining local order, which did not require the defendant's assistance. Moreover, the defendant only had a small number of remaining troops stationed in Nanjing, which was even less important. Even if he had ordered his subordinates to jointly maintain security with the enemy troops, it was because he was at his wit's end and had no choice but to submit. How could he hope to be forgiven for this? Furthermore, if the defendant was sincerely awaiting punishment, he should have awaited orders in Nanjing regardless of the circumstances, but he hurriedly fled to Japan. Isn't that fleeing out of fear of punishment? Therefore, it is determined that the above defenses are nothing more than embellishments in the hope of reducing or exempting himself from guilt, and are all unacceptable. According to [missing text], then [missing text] violated [missing text] principle, apart from still requesting the defendant's original [missing text] that the party cannot be divided and the country must be unified. His following Wang Jingwei was due to the [missing text] feeling that he could not [missing text] sever, and he supported the party and the country, supported [missing text] and had measures to unify the country [missing text] to show. Therefore, he pointed [missing text] out that the original trial did not conduct [missing text] the investigation [missing text] and said that the public defender appointed by the original trial was unable to [missing text] see the defendant before the trial date to fully prepare [missing text] to develop his ability to attack and defend, and that the original trial did not [missing text] use the provisions of discretion [missing text] and surrender, [missing text] and that the extreme penalty was imposed, which were all points that he could not accept, etc. It should be known that the defendant, in fact, followed Wang Jingwei in making peace with the enemy, which ran counter to the central government's established policy of resistance against Japan, and relied on the enemy's protection [missing text] to reorganize the puppet party and establish another regime to confront our central government. This clearly showed his intention and behavior of colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist his own country. The crime was already established. Even if he had other intentions or different opinions that were completely different from what he had implemented, it would not be related to the establishment of his crime. Moreover, considering the means of the defendant's crime and the harm caused by the crime, the circumstances were extremely serious, and it cannot be said that he should be reduced in punishment because he had one or two measures to assist in the resistance against Japan. There is no need to investigate matters related to these defenses again. Since the defendant did not voluntarily surrender and be tried after the crime was not discovered, it does not comply with the provisions on surrender in the Criminal Law and the Regulations on the Surrender of Traitors, and therefore, the original judgment cannot be criticized for not [missing text] using this provision improperly. Even if the public defender Shang Rong appointed by the original trial did not meet with the defendant before the [missing text] trial date, he defended the defendant in court on the trial date, which is not enough [missing text] [missing text] [missing text] [missing text] why not [missing text], then the [missing text] appeal intention is also completely unacceptable. The original judgment was based on the [missing text] matter [missing text] determined that the defendant was an accomplice in colluding with the enemy country [missing text] to resist the original [missing text] sin, and used the fact that Japan [missing text] to annex our country as its conspiracy. After the September 18th Incident [missing text] occupied our four northeastern provinces and established the so-called Manchu Empire. The clan then sent troops to Inner Mongolia and advanced [missing text] Peace [missing text], which evolved into the July 7th Incident. Our country endured [missing text] and in order to seek the survival of the nation, we rose up to resist, and the whole country went to national disaster to fight for the final victory. The defendant was originally a central government official and should have understood this deeply. However, due to the slight setbacks of our army in the early stages of the war, his intentions [missing text] were shaken and he followed Wang Jingwei, willing to be used by the Japanese invaders. At a time when the [missing text] trend reversed and every hair was critical, he secretly left and sent a telegram advocating peace. Then he formed a puppet government and betrayed the central government, and concluded an alliance with the Japanese invaders, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies, repeatedly undermining the national policy of resistance against Japan, and helping the Japanese invaders to invade, which would have plunged the country and the nation into a state of irreparable disaster. He was truly ignorant of the big picture and willing to be a criminal. There was nothing to be pitied about in law. Therefore, according to Article 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 8, Paragraph 1 and Article 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all his property was confiscated except for a discretionary amount for the necessary living expenses of his family. The judgment of guilt and punishment was all appropriate and should be approved. Based on the above, it should be decided according to Article 20, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the judgment is as follows: Zhang Yuxun, Presiding Judge of the Second Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, Yin Baixu, Lin Shangbin, Luo Renji, Chen Shicheng, Clerk Li Bangfeng, May 16, 35th year of the Republic of China. [Whitespace] [Whitespace] [Whitespace] and Feng, the chief engineer of the Haitang Salvation Committee, were injured. This newspaper's reporter was also slightly injured.</p>
<h3>The Capital High Court Opened a Trial Yesterday to Try the Female Traitor Mo Guokang; The Court Debate Concluded and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the Afternoon of the 10th</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 3rd] Mo Guokang, the concubine of Chen Gongbo, who was executed in Suzhou this morning, appeared in the Capital High Court at 2 PM this afternoon. Because Chen was a teacher at the school, after working in the party department, he often met Chen at [Sun] Yat-sen's residence. From the 15th year of the Republic, he participated in the Northern Expedition and also belonged to Chen's subordinates. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, Mo began to serve Chen, playing the role of "caring for" him, but stating that she herself was not "married." Regarding going to Nanjing from Chongqing, she said that Chen invited her to take a look at what was happening and intended to try to save the situation, not to advocate peace, and she did not participate in politics. She also flatly denied (1) that she had been involved in Sino-Japanese treaties during her tenure as a puppet Legislative Yuan member, and (2) that she had been a general secretary of the puppet Political Security Department, acting as a substitute for the director, Chen, and pretended not to know that the department was a special agency. Subsequently, Liu Xingwu, a staff member of the Second Bureau of the puppet Political Security Department, and Yu Xiaochen, the deputy director of the accounting office, were summoned to the court to confront the defendant, but no facts were obtained. Finally, Mo also said that she never criticized the resistance against Japan, never criticized the supreme leader, and did her best to help patriotic people. At the beginning of the debate, the defendant added that going to Japan was to take care of Chen, and she definitely did not flee to escape punishment. She said, "Of course, I will be with my friend to the end." At this point, the presiding judge asked again, "Chen has been sentenced to death. What are your thoughts?" Mo smiled weakly and replied, "Whatever the government decides, that's how it is. I have no thoughts." Then she said, "I only feel that he sacrificed himself for his friends." Subsequently, the appointed defense lawyer stood up to defend her. At the end of the court session, it was announced that the debate on this case was over and that the verdict would be announced at the High Court at 10 AM on the 10th before adjourning.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Grave and Perilous Foreign Trade!</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported that since the victory, European and American shipping companies have resumed operations one after another, and large numbers of ships have arrived one after another. However, prices in this city are higher than in other countries, which has led to a decrease in exports. Most foreign ships are returning home empty. What a profound picture this is! This is a chronic disease that can lead to national decline! The reason for this is not solely the fault of the citizens of Shanghai, but the people of Shanghai are watching this dangerous situation without shouting out in pain! They are still carefree and laughing, which is truly strange and absurd. Although overseas shipping has not yet returned to its former glory in the past eight or nine months, goods for general civilian use have been arriving steadily. Today, the Shanghai market is full of foreign goods. Cotton and wheat are not to mention, even minor items such as orange soda, candy, cigarettes, and even soap bubbles for children to play with are all supplied from abroad, while our exports are almost zero, causing foreign ships to return home empty. To put it jokingly, if we continue on this path and do not change, then what we eat, wear, live in, and use will all become "American equipment." If there is only import and no export, where will trade balance come from? In terms of the balance of international payments, remittances from overseas Chinese, church income, and travel income have all sharply declined, which puts us in an absolutely unfavorable position in the balance of international payments. If this continues to develop, our nation's economic life will inevitably suffer from anemia and wither away. If the authorities have not yet seen this serious disease, it is unwise; if they have already seen it but do not quickly try to save it, it is inhumane!</p>
<p>The reasons for this serious disease are not simple, and the fundamental solution may require striving for political stability. However, this anemic disease, which is on the verge of death, cannot wait for the political problem to be delayed. We must quickly take necessary and appropriate measures in the economic field. Wang Yunwu, the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, comes from the people and should know the hardships of the people's livelihood; he runs a business and should know the industrial crisis. After taking office, what medicine will he use for this dangerous disease? This is what we urgently want to know.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the disease is critically ill, and it may be too late to rescue it quickly. On the positive side, the government should immediately strictly control imported goods. Because under the current general circumstances, foreign prices are lower than those in our country, so even if tariffs are adjusted, it will be of no avail. For example, if a certain commodity is imported, even with the addition of freight and an import tax of 100% or 200%, it is still cheaper than domestically produced goods. An import tax of 100% or even 200% is already the application of tariff policy, but it may still not be able to achieve the goal of curbing imports. Even if foreign exchange is not provided, merchants can still order with US dollars, so the allocation of foreign exchange cannot limit imports. For the sake of the present, it seems that a licensing system should be adopted for import trade. Some commodities that are not necessary to import, or that people can live without consuming, should be prohibited from import. The government can stipulate the highest monthly or annual import quota and not allow free import. At present, the reversal of our country's foreign trade is mostly due to the government's almost pure laissez-faire attitude towards import trade, with at most only the application of some tariff policies. Furthermore, the circulation of US dollars in our country's market is enough to undermine our foreign exchange allocation methods. If this laissez-faire policy is allowed to continue, it will inevitably bankrupt our nation. We must quickly adopt an import control and quota licensing policy, and at the same time absolutely prohibit the use of US dollars in the market in order to strengthen foreign exchange control, so that we can save the current decline.</p>
<p>On the positive side, we must quickly encourage exports. Our silk, tea, tung oil, tungsten, zinc, and pig bristles are all major export commodities. Among them, silk and pig bristles, etc., now have substitutes in foreign countries, and their production prices are lower than those of our country's local products. The main reason for the sluggishness of our foreign export trade is that our country's commodity production costs are too high and cannot compete with others in the international market. For example, if farmers raise silkworms and sell cocoons, they cannot cover the cost of mulberry leaves and labor, and reeling silk for sale cannot even cover the cost of cocoons. If this continues, not only will industry go bankrupt, but agriculture will also go bankrupt. Moreover, transportation has not yet been fully restored, materials cannot circulate, which makes prices soar and exports stagnate. With such a difference between domestic and foreign prices, if the government does not consider revising the exchange rate for export trade, or adopting a subsidy policy, we dare to say that foreign ships will always return home empty. To put it another way, if we only see foreign goods being imported and not local products being exported for a year and a half, then one day even if foreign goods are imported, there will be no customers to buy them, because everyone's blood will be almost drained!</p>
<p>In short, if the government still has an economic policy, it should start with this big picture and quickly use licensing and quota methods to strictly control imported goods. On the other hand, it should revise the exchange rate or subsidize the losses of exporters so that exported local products can also be sold at low prices in overseas markets. It is necessary to make our country's export trade, which has shrunk for eight years, recover and prosper in order to avoid the fate of economic subjugation! Otherwise, China will not only have no hope of becoming an industrial country, but it will not even be qualified to be a dependent agricultural country. How serious, how dangerous!</p>

<p>Special Tax on Fresh Cocoons Exempted: The silk cocoon industry in this county has reached its lowest point. Silk merchants lose one million yuan per dan (unit of weight) of silk reeled. Farmers raising silkworms also suffer losses due to low cocoon prices and increased costs, leading to the removal of mulberry trees and the planting of rice paddies. Fortunately, the request to exempt the special tax on fresh cocoons has been approved by the provincial government.

<p>Security in Yangzhou City is Assured: Since the surrender of the enemy and the subsequent occupation of Gaoyou and Shaobo Town in the county by the Communist army, coupled with the constant flow of displaced people passing through or residing in Yangzhou from the Li-Xia-He area, numbering in the thousands daily, the people inevitably feel unsettled. Furthermore, the Communist army has launched attacks and provocations against the National Army's positions, resulting in over a hundred battles, large and small, in recent months. After newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai revealed this, people from all walks of life expressed concern about the security of Yangzhou. Recently, senior officers of the National Army stationed in Yangzhou stated that their strict adherence to their posts is in compliance with the supreme authority's "Ceasefire Agreement" and the implementation of the ceasefire order. The Communist forces within Yangzhou County are estimated to have a strength of about one brigade, currently occupying the areas of Shaobo, Qiao, Fanchuan, and Gou towns. The National Army, adhering to the attitude of complying with the ceasefire order and for self-defense, will not allow the Communist forces to advance further and will firmly defend its existing positions.

<p>Eastern and Northern Anhui Suffer Calamities: The area around Donghu and Xihu in Qiuzhi County, northern Anhui, has become a bandit den. Last year, the provincial government established the Four-County Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Sanhejian to suppress and kill a large number of bandit leaders nearby, and the region was finally peaceful. This spring, with the headquarters disbanded, prices have risen again, and the people are struggling. The latent bandits in the county have risen again, and after disarming the Yongsui Township Office and the self-defense forces, they have become even more rampant. The other day, they even raided Ye Jiaji and He Kouji, looting extensively. Currently, bandits are everywhere in the Sanyuan Dian, Dao Ji Miao, and Xi Gao Ji areas, and the people are fleeing. The county government, with its weak forces, is telegraphing the Second Special Security Commissioner's Office stationed in Lihuang to send troops to assist in suppression to prevent the situation from spreading. Furthermore, the Communist forces in Xuyi, Wuhe, Tianchang, Laian, and Jiashan in eastern Anhui are now advancing eastward towards the Jinpu Railway, harassing the people west of the railway. When they fail to coerce the people to follow them, they demolish houses, cut down crops, loot grain, dig up the Huai Dike, and indiscriminately slaughter returning youths and gentry.

<h3>Soviet Union Continues to Criticize Britain and the United States, Accusing Their Policies of Aiming to Eliminate International Cooperation, British Foreign Secretary to Respond Sternly in Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd (Dispatch)] The Moscow radio station's criticism of British and American foreign policy seems to have reached its peak today. Foreign Secretary Bevin may respond sternly during the debate in the House of Commons this week. London officials are deeply concerned about the Soviet radio station and newspapers' criticism of Britain and the United States. Moscow radio today broadcast an article from the New Era magazine, launching an unprecedentedly fierce attack on British and American policies, accusing the measures implemented by Britain and the United States of completely eliminating the hope of international cooperation. Whether international relations will change in the future depends on the policies of Britain and the United States. Restoring the spirit of wartime cooperation or continuing today's policy of forcing other countries to accept their opinions could lead to two completely different situations in future international relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd (Dispatch)] Soviet newspapers and radio stations have recently continuously criticized the policies implemented by the United States in the occupied zone of Germany, denouncing them as "illegal, brutal," and not complying with the joint resolutions of the Allied powers. Moscow radio criticized General Clay, the Deputy Military Governor of the US-occupied zone of Germany, for refusing to transfer reparations materials, believing that this move is sufficient to foster the monopoly of certain German industries, as most Hitlerite industrialists still occupy leading positions in various economic sectors of Germany. The "News Bulletin" criticized the four-nation treaty on guaranteeing German disarmament proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, believing that it intends to avoid complying with the joint resolutions of the Allied powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters also reported] The "Propagandist Magazine," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, stated: American soldiers strictly seal off information on atomic energy, preventing it from being used for peaceful industrial purposes. The United States is only engaged in the military use of atomic energy, so atomic energy has not yet been developed for peaceful industrial purposes. This is all due to the consistent use of power diplomacy by the United States.</p>
<h3>Eleanor Roosevelt Advocates US-Soviet Friendship</h3>

<h3>Eisenhower's Speech</h3>
<p>Future Wars Will Be Extremely Fierce, Hoping to Strive to Avoid Tragedy</p>

<h3>Standing Army Retains 3 Million, Soviet Union Continues to Reduce its Armed Forces, Over 10 Million Soldiers Discharged in the Past Ten Months, Focus on Atomic Energy Research</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nuremberg, Germany, 1st (Dispatch)] An Allied official said today: In the past ten months, the Soviet Union has discharged over 10 million soldiers. The military service age has been reduced from 55 to 29. There are still 6 million armed forces, including 4.5 million in the army and 1.57 million in the navy and air force, and it is prepared to continue reducing them. Approximately, the Soviet Union has a total of 3 million standing and reserve forces. The Soviet Union is now giving the highest priority to research on the application of atomic energy to military equipment or major heavy industries. Soviet scientists and technicians are working diligently to catch up with the achievements of the United States, Britain, and Canada in jointly researching atomic energy. United Nations envoys in Moscow believe that Soviet scientists undoubtedly know the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing, but it is expected that Soviet factories will not be able to create a perfect atomic bomb before 1948 or 1949. Although the Soviet Red Army has been reduced, it is still the most powerful army in the world. In an emergency, the expansion of the Red Army is faster than the armies of Western countries, and this time, a fundamental downsizing is being implemented. Special encouragement is given to junior officers who have fought on the battlefield for a long time to re-enter the military, taking their combat experience. Anti-British propaganda has now been heard in Moscow, and the Soviet Union has manufactured light military vehicles similar to the American jeep, the world's largest tanks, and rocket-propelled aircraft. The US Embassy in the Soviet Union held a formal reception on US Army Day, but only one Soviet general attended, so the highest-ranking US military officer in the Soviet Union did not attend the Soviet military parade on May Day.</p>

<h3>Laski's Talk: British Labor Government Can Last for 20 Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd (Dispatch)] Labor Party Chairman Laski gave a speech in Newcastle today, predicting that the Labor government has a hope of lasting up to 20 years. The whole country generally supports the Labor government's social programs. The upcoming independence of India is also a major event in modern history. Laski also mentioned the disagreement with Bevin's political views, but also said that Bevin's reputation has increased since taking office ten months ago. Many oppose Bevin's policies towards Greece, and I also disagree with the government's Spanish policy. I feel that we should support the demands of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Poland, and eliminate Spain's reign of terror. When Bevin first took office, he advocated that British troops occupy Indonesia. I know that there was no other way at the time. Now he, Sir Cole, and Vice-Governor Van Mook have a new plan for Indonesian freedom. I hope that the British will not support Indonesia being exploited by the Netherlands. The 700 million Asian nations knew they had the ability to govern themselves after the war. We should now help them gain freedom. Regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, everyone in and out of Parliament unanimously supports it.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Criminals Attempt to Evade Trial, Court Resolutely Refuses, Chief Prosecutor to Announce Indictment Today, Then Adjourns for Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent, Tokyo, 3rd] The Far East International Military Tribunal reconvened at 9:30 this morning, resolutely rejecting the defense lawyers' arguments to acquit the defendants of the charges. However, it granted the defense lawyers a ten-day extension to prepare their defense. Among the audience were seven Chinese pilots who arrived a few days ago on a giant Chinese aircraft. The defendants on trial are twenty-six Japanese war criminals responsible for the massacre of millions of Chinese. When the judges entered the court, about one hundred Allied and Japanese photographers rushed forward, but there were no Chinese photographers. As the Indian judge entered the court, the war criminals cast mocking glances at him. Today, the defense team presented over ten motions. While lawyers and prosecutors debated, the judges conferred and sought each other's opinions on resolutions. The Soviet judge often waited for the approval of Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao. Regarding the defense's request for an adjournment, American lawyer Captain Herman stood up and said that some American defense attorneys had just arrived yesterday, so he hoped the court would allow reasonable time to study the evidence and consult with the war criminals. After a fifteen-minute recess, Presiding Judge Webb announced an adjournment until June 13th, giving them ten days to prepare all the evidence for their defense. Although the opening date was postponed, the defense team agreed that Chief Prosecutor Keenan would publicly present the indictment at 10:20 AM on the 22nd.</p>

Yesterday, his friends discovered his disappearance and searched everywhere, only to learn that he had been captured the night before and killed in a French hospital, with severe knife and gunshot wounds to his head and feet. Another Chinese resident, Li De, was shot and wounded while passing near the Chinese Consulate the night before. He was rescued by Chinese Air Force personnel stationed in Vietnam, but died of severe injuries. French and Vietnamese authorities, concerned that frequent clashes between the two sides' troops are affecting public order, have organized patrol teams composed of officers and soldiers from both sides to patrol the city to prevent further clashes. We believe that we share the same respect for human dignity and the same love for peace. We all recognize that international friendship and understanding are the foundation of our efforts for peace and prosperous cooperation.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Headquarters Steps Up Security, Rumors of Plot to Assassinate MacArthur, U.S. Side Claims No Knowledge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Tokyo U.S. Military Police Commander Allen today denied rumors broadcast by a U.S. radio reporter that Japanese die-hards plotted to assassinate MacArthur last week, saying, "I have no knowledge of this matter. One hundred Japanese police officers, a U.S. military unit, and military police have been added to strengthen security along the route from the U.S. Embassy, MacArthur's residence, to headquarters. If it were true, I would know." The head of the counterintelligence department at headquarters, Cresswell, also said that the rumor was unfounded. An assassination plot was only hearsay, and although there was some rumor, it was too vague to investigate. After ordering an investigation, the rumor dissipated. The other rumor of a plot to assassinate MacArthur on May Day has not been verified. This rumor was broadcast by ABC's Tokyo correspondent, Taylor, who said that Japanese die-hards planned to assassinate MacArthur on the way from his residence to headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] It is reported that a Japanese man named Arai, 20, was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police for threatening to "eliminate" MacArthur. The MacArthur Headquarters Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigation Division said today that it had not received a formal report. As of noon today, the Chief of the National Police Agency of the Ministry of Home Affairs had also not received a report.</p>

Both labor and management now recognize that the strike is having a significant impact, as the national stockpile of coal for winter use is decreasing by 210,000 tons each day that the labor dispute is not resolved. Meanwhile, all 400,000 anthracite coal miners nationwide are expected to return to work today and resume production. However, mine owners in Alabama declared that they would suspend operations unless the government allows an increase in coal prices to offset the increase in miners' wages. It is also reported that the steel industry has begun to resume production because the coal supply can return to normal.</p>

<h3>Japanese Police Reduce Windfall, Daggers Replaced with Short Clubs</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The Japanese police system was originally different from the so-called "police control system" and "police soldier system." Every policeman wore a long sword on his waist, looking very imposing, which made the people fearful. Since the defeat, MacArthur believed that the Japanese police system must also be democratized, and the first thing to do was to abolish the police swords and replace them with police batons. It is reported that 1,300 police officers in Gunma Prefecture will begin to implement this starting on the 7th of this month. In the near future, other places will also implement it gradually. The police baton is made of hardwood, 50 centimeters long, and worn around the waist, like the ones used by traffic police in our country.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Sever Relations with Franco Government Receives Favorable Reactions from Various Countries, Security Council to Meet to Discuss the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 3rd: The Security Council Subcommittee, in its report on the investigation of the Franco regime, declared that it had no legal right to take action against possible aggressors. The U.S. government expressed dissatisfaction with this. After reviewing the report, the U.S. State Department may revise the point on various countries severing relations with Spain. Severing relations may cause the Spanish people to resent foreign interference.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] The United Nations Committee to Investigate the Spanish Question proposed that if the Franco government does not step down by September, the entire world should sever relations with it. Representatives of the United Nations Security Council today expressed favorable reactions to this. However, some of the Committee's recommendations will encounter varying degrees of opposition. The Council is scheduled to meet on the 6th to discuss it. Representatives from five parties acknowledge that the Committee's proposal for the United Nations General Assembly to initiate the severance of relations with Franco is surprising, as the Council has repeatedly hesitated to do so. It is difficult to determine whether there will be strong opposition in the future that will cause significant changes to the Committee's recommendation. This report has been supported by the Committee's members from China, France, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Brazil, making it difficult for any of the other six representatives on the Council to gather enough votes to make significant changes. Brazilian representative Valesco has remained neutral on this proposal but believes that there will not be any major changes. A spokesperson for the U.S. delegation expressed the same view. The key is the attitude of the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Gromyko has not yet reacted, but representatives expect that he will oppose some points in the report based on his previous stance. The points that are most likely to be opposed are: (1) The Security Council has no right to direct the severance of relations with Spain, as the Spanish government is only regarded as a possible, not an actual, threat to international peace; (2) Handing the case over to the United Nations General Assembly. According to the United Nations Charter, the passage of this report requires a certain number of necessary votes, including the five permanent members of the Security Council: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union casts a negative vote, the Committee's recommendation will be invalid. However, Gromyko may take the same attitude as he did when the Committee was established on April 29th and express his opposition by abstaining from voting. One recommendation that is expected to be passed unanimously without opposition is the Council's endorsement of the joint declaration of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on March 4th, which called on the Spanish people to overthrow the Franco government by peaceful means and establish a provisional government pending free elections.</p>
<p>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Report</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] The conclusions and recommendations of the report of the United Nations Security Council Committee on the Spanish Question are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) (A) Although the actions of the Franco regime do not currently constitute a threat to peace, as interpreted by Article 39 of the Charter, preventing the Council from ordering or authorizing the execution of the steps stipulated in Articles 40 or 42 of the Charter, these actions have indeed created a situation that poses a threat to international peace and security. Therefore, as interpreted by Article 34 of the Charter, this situation is likely to endanger international peace and security; (B) Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 36, paragraph 1, the Council has the right to recommend appropriate procedures or methods to address the situation described in paragraph A.</p>
<p>(2) The final question is what steps the Subcommittee should recommend to the Security Council. After careful consideration, the Subcommittee believes it should take effective and appropriate steps to deal with this particular event, and considering the important powers retained by the United Nations General Assembly under Article 10 of the Charter, it proposes the following recommendations: (A) The Security Council should support the principles listed in the joint declaration of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on March 4, 1946. (B) The Security Council should forward the evidence and report submitted by this Subcommittee and the following recommendations to the United Nations General Assembly. If the General Assembly does not cancel the Franco regime and realize the political freedoms described in the declaration, the General Assembly should pass a resolution recommending that each member state of the United Nations immediately sever diplomatic relations with the Franco regime. (C) The Secretary-General of the United Nations should take appropriate steps to notify all member states of the United Nations and other relevant countries of these recommendations.</p>
<p>(3) If the General Assembly believes that all the conditions stipulated in the declaration of March 4, 1946, have been fully realized, including the cancellation of the Franco regime, the declaration of a political amnesty, the return of exiled Spanish people, the opening of freedom of political assembly and association, and the implementation of free and open elections, the Subcommittee proposes that the Assembly give good faith consideration to a freely elected Spanish government applying to join the United Nations.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Li Ze Case: Two Witnesses Testified; Court Adjourns for Sentencing on the 8th; Shu Yueqiao Demands Confiscation of All the Defendant's Assets; Prosecutor Claims Motive for Accusation is Irrelevant</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) The sensational case of Li Ze, general manager of the Sun-Sun Company, suspected of being a traitor, was previously brought to a conclusion by Chief Judge Liu Yugui of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, with sentencing scheduled for the 7th of last month. Subsequently, due to Li Ze's testimony involving the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" (商統會) case, the High Court deemed it necessary to investigate, and in accordance with Article 284 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a retrial was held yesterday. The defense called witnesses Cai Ziwo and Mu Yunbo, who testified that Shu Yueqiao's behavior was improper, and that he engaged in extortion, and when it was unsuccessful, he engaged in malicious publicity and then made accusations. Shu absolutely denied this, stating that they were fabricating accusations out of thin air and speaking nonsense. Another accuser, Han Wucheng, stated, "We, all of my colleagues, are willing to guarantee Shu Yueqiao's character with our lives. His accusation against Li Ze is completely out of a sense of justice." Furthermore, Shu Yueqiao demanded that all of Li Ze's assets be confiscated and distributed to impoverished compatriots. After further arguments by the defendant's lawyers, Zhang Shijian and Chen Yunrui, the court adjourned for sentencing at 2:30 PM on the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>At 3:10 PM yesterday, the courtroom was already packed with spectators, the majority being employees of the Sun-Sun Company and family and friends of Li Ze. Li Ze was then brought into the courtroom by court police. Li wore a dark gray silk long gown, with white socks visible at the hem, and dark yellow leather shoes. His hands were tied behind his back. After he stood in the defendant's dock, Chief Judge Liu announced the reason for the retrial and instructed the court clerk to read the transcripts of the previous hearing. Shu Yueqiao and others stated that there were no errors. Li Ze corrected two points: (1) Wen Lanting succeeded Tang Shoumin in managing the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" in August of the 33rd year of the Republic; (2) Of the over 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth purchased by the "Commerce and Trade Control Association," the Japanese only took away over 60 pieces. The witness Cai Ziwo was then called. Cai is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, 50 years old, and is reportedly a close relative of Li Ze. He resides on Lloyd Road but claimed not to know the house number. He also claimed that he previously worked in the security department of the Sun-Sun Company and is currently the director of the general affairs department. He doesn't often see Shu Yueqiao but knows that Shu is motivated by money. He initially demanded eleven gold bars, which Li Ze refused. Later, he reduced the demand to seven bars, but that was also refused. Finally, he reduced the demand to three bars, but it was still not given. The judge asked Li Ze, who also said that this was true. However, Shu Yueqiao said:</p>
<p>They fabricated accusations out of thin air and spoke nonsense. My accusation against Li Ze for being a traitor is based entirely on the people's sense of justice. When questioned again, Li Ze claimed that Shu's usual conduct was often improper. He was later introduced to the New Capital Hotel, but it was the same. He was repeatedly advised to change, but he did not. He even cursed loudly in public and incited strikes, which led to the police being called to remove him. After someone interceded, he wrote a letter of repentance and was paid 70,000 yuan before leaving his position. Later, he asked his neighbor, surnamed Li, to request reinstatement, but it was unsuccessful. He then maliciously destroyed and promoted [his accusations] outside, even reporting them to the Zhabei Sub-bureau. Another witness, Mu Yunbo, from Tianjin, 38 years old, was then called. Reportedly, his relationship with Shu Yueqiao was very good.</p>
<p>He attempted to mediate on October 18th of last year. Shu asked to speak to him individually on the 19th, claiming that he had lost money trading gold on the side and wanted to "bump into" Li Ze. He then made three demands: (1) Give him</p>
<p>two gold bars to compensate for his losses; (2) Find him a job; (3) Supplement his salary if it was insufficient for living expenses. However, Shu Yueqiao said that on October 18th, he was in Ningbo, and the so-called conversation was fabricated. In fact, his accusation was because Li Ze had used despicable and shameless means to try to resolve the matter. On October 5th of last year, he even went to his home to discuss it, but he refused. Another accuser, Han Wucheng, claimed that Cai Ziwo was a close relative of Li Ze, and Mu Yunbo was formerly Li Ze's bodyguard. He had gambled away funds entrusted to him at the Six Nations Hotel but was not reprimanded by Li Ze. This time, he was repaying the favor, which was understandable, but their bias was not permitted by law. He then launched into a lengthy discourse, saying that those who betray national policy are traitors, like Qin Hui of the Southern Song Dynasty and Wu Sangui of the late Ming Dynasty, who were deranged and colluded with enemy states, which is not permitted by the people and the law. Li Ze is one of these people, so he is being accused according to law and should be punished to uphold loyalty and filial piety, so that the</p>
<p>national spirit of five thousand years will not perish. At this point, regarding Li Ze's participation in the first and second joint meetings of the "Commerce and Trade Control Association," there are meeting minutes as evidence. Li Ze testified, "I did not attend every time, I did not make any proposals, and I did not speak." He also claimed that the defendant has been working since the 7th year of the Republic for over 20 years and has never engaged in speculation or harmed the people. He has been detained for five months, and the losses are incalculable, so he asked for an early verdict. Chief Judge Liu then declared the opening of arguments. Prosecutor Dai Laoduo refuted the defendant's claim that he did nothing, saying that since he participated in the council and passed resolutions, it was working for the enemy and puppets, and the motive for accusing a traitor is irrelevant to the case. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shizhao, defended the defendant, emphasizing that the determination of a traitor should be based on their actions. Li Ze only used the false position in the "Commerce and Trade Control Association" as a cover and was wholeheartedly working for the central government, so he cannot be judged as a traitor. After the arguments concluded, Gan Tian, a representative of the "Support Li Ze Traitor Accusation Association," came to the court to express his opinion, saying that Li Ze, as a director of the puppet Commerce and Trade Control Association, was a major economic traitor and should be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Senatorial Election Lawsuit: Two Cases Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Plaintiff in the Fifth District Voluntarily Withdraws</p>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) Two more senatorial election lawsuits were heard in the District Court yesterday morning: (1) City Councilor Cen Ziliang of the Fifth District was sued by Zhu Ying, a citizen of the district, because Cen's qualifications were questionable, and therefore, he requested confirmation of invalidity. During the hearing yesterday morning, Zhu Ying voluntarily withdrew the original lawsuit, so it was not heard. (2) Cao Shengzhi, Chief of General Affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sued for confirmation of the validity of his election as the third alternate senator. It had already been heard once. The litigation agent, lawyer Huang Renda, appeared in court. The defendant was represented by the legal representative, Xia Ming, Deputy District Chief of the district, and Li Xuexun, Chief of the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department, who did not retain a lawyer. Xia claimed that the district received 36,000 ballots, issued 23,094 ballots, and the ballot box contained 22,650 ballots, with 452 invalid ballots, including 48 blank ballots. The pre-vote monitoring was absolutely fair and impartial. Li said: As long as the election</p>
<p>officials are legitimate, anyone can be elected. Witness Chen Hongsheng was then called. Chen served as a recorder for Cao in the voting area and knew that Cao received a total of 1,611 votes and 36 invalid ballots. Lawyer Huang claimed that the 15 invalid ballots examined in the previous hearing should not be regarded as invalid ballots, and the small number of blank ballots indicated that they had been switched out. The court adjourned for sentencing at 9:00 AM on June 8th.</p>
<h3>Mayor Schedules Reception for Cardinal Tian Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Trial of Traitors: Lu Xihou, Wang Xuenong, etc., All Ordered to be Rescheduled for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) The High Court heard several more cases of traitors yesterday: (1) Wang Xuezhu, from Shanghai, 50 years old, participated in enemy puppet work from June of the 27th year of the Republic and served as a supervisor and managing director and chief of the general affairs department of the puppet Huazhong Water and Electricity Company. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and prosecuted by the High Court Prosecutor's Office. Wang still argued, "My participation in the puppet organization was with the permission of the central government, and I have assisted underground workers and have contributed to the country." (2) Lu Xihou, from Shanghai, 53 years old, is the chairman and general manager of the puppet China Sports Company (Huili Ball Field). (3) Zhao Ziqian, from Guangdong, 39 years old, is a managing director; (4) Zhao Yuntai, from Guangdong, 56 years old, is a supervisor and chief of general affairs; (5) Huang Chuwei, from Guangdong, 47 years old, is the chief of accounting. The above four people were all prosecuted by the High Court Prosecutor's Office for gathering crowds to gamble during the enemy puppet era and using gambling taxes to supply the puppet municipal government with funds and exploiting good citizens. At the start of the trial, the four criminals all tried to quibble, saying that they did not harm the people. The cases of puppet Jiaxing County magistrate Jin Jianhong and Zhang Shaobo, two traitors, were also questioned once and ordered to be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Puppet Bureau Chief Qian Nengxia Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) Qian Nengxia, the puppet Nanjing City Economic Bureau Chief, was sentenced yesterday.

<h3>Rice Merchants Suspected of Being Involved in Grain Loan: Strict Investigation Underway; Rice Registration Deadline Today; Citizens Can Report Rice Shops That Raise Prices</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) There have been various reports about grain merchants suspected of being arrested for misusing grain loans, but they are quite inconsistent. According to this newspaper's investigation, in addition to Wu Rongshang of Santai Rice Shop, who has already been detained, there are also Wang Xunzhi of Yangtze Company and two of the company's employees. In addition, the heads of various grain loan rice shops are summoned as needed. Therefore, unless substantial evidence of guilt is obtained, they will not be detained at any time. The detention of Le Yongming of Wuchang Rice Shop is due to suspicion of price gouging and is unrelated to the grain loan case.</p>
<p>Double inquiry: The Gongxin Accounting Firm, entrusted by the Grain Loan Audit Committee to investigate the grain loan accounts, has suspended its auditing work. It is reported that the principal of the firm, Xi Wangshu, was in Hangzhou when the firm was entrusted with the investigation. Now that Mr. Xi has returned to Shanghai, he feels that it is inappropriate to carry out the grain loan investigation, as he is also a member of the audit committee.</p>
<p>After the authorities vigorously cracked down on speculation in the local rice market, rice prices have indeed fallen in recent days. However, the rice market transactions are being monitored by relevant authorities, and rice merchants dare not test the law. However, the retail prices of various rice shops are not uniform. The authorities have paid attention to this, and if any rice shop's selling price exceeds the stipulated 6% profit margin, it will be dealt with severely. Citizens can also report at any time. Regarding the registration of rice stocks by rice merchants, the municipal government has set the deadline for today. Generally, rice merchants, realizing that the authorities will keep their word, rushed to the guild yesterday to complete the registration, and the response was enthusiastic. It is rumored that the municipal government will send personnel to secretly investigate according to the registered quantity. If it is found that there is concealed rice, in addition to confiscating all of their stored rice, they will also be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Officer of the Garrison Command Bids Farewell to Li Ji and Lan; Li Declines Gold Horse</h3>
<p>Officers above the rank of major from the headquarters of the Songhu Garrison Command and its affiliated units held a farewell gathering for Commander Li Ji and Lan at the New Life Clubhouse yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM. Attendees included Mr. Li, the new Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, the commander of the 146th Division Dai Chuanxin, the commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment Wu Guangyun, the commander of the Protection Corps Cuan Youlue, and about 200 others. During the gathering, Mr. Li gave a speech encouraging his colleagues to continue their efforts. He also said that he had read in the newspaper that his colleagues were planning to make a gold horse as a souvenir, which he was deeply apprehensive about. Currently, prices are extremely high, and the monthly salary of colleagues is not enough to fill their stomachs. How can he bear to receive such a precious item and increase everyone's burden? He specially announced that he can only acknowledge this kind intention, but he will definitely decline to receive this item.</p>
<h3>Patrol Officer Accused of Embezzlement and Malpractice: Transferred to the High Court for Punishment</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) Yang Qing, a Ningbo native who was formerly the captain of the puppet detective team in Caojiadu and an old acquaintance of the Hongqiao gambling table, continued to work as an undercover patrol officer in the Xujiahui Sub-bureau's investigation section after the victory. Now, due to investigating a tenant Zhu Jian's transfer fee of 1.8 million yuan, a death occurred. Recently, he was further accused of covering up drug trafficking, forcibly occupying civilian houses, embezzlement, and malpractice. In order to clarify officialdom, the district bureau issued an order to detain him and transferred him to the High Court yesterday for punishment according to law.</p>

<h3>Traitor Wen Zongyao Sold Public Property: Guangzhao Guild Files Lawsuit; Court Schedules Hearing Today</h3>
<p>During the enemy puppet era, the traitor Wen Zongyao, relying on his power, seized the Guangzhao Guild, acting arbitrarily and treating public property as private property. He even sold the land of the old Guangzhao Villa owned by the Guangzhao Guild privately, totaling more than 130 acres. According to the Guangzhao Guild's charter, even if all the board members unanimously agreed, the property owned by the Guangzhao Guild absolutely cannot be sold. It is further heard that the reorganization committee of the guild filed a lawsuit with the District Court on May 21, requesting the court to confirm that Wen's theft and sale of land was invalid.

<h3>Yu Youren Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for General Inspection of Post-War Situation; Deeply Believes Peaceful Unification Can Be Achieved</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, accompanied by Control Committee members Yan Zhuang and Lin Jing, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by express train at 3:50 PM yesterday morning. Those who went to the North Station to welcome him included Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Jiangsu Supervisory District Inspector Cheng Zhonghang, and Xu Jianhou, Zhou Peizhen, Gu Yucang, and Yu's eldest daughter-in-law, Mrs. Yu Zhide. After Mr. Yu, leaning on a cane, got off the train, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one and exchanged greetings. Mr. Yu was wearing a blue cloth long gown, with cloth socks and cloth shoes. His long beard fluttered in the wind, and he had a dignified appearance. Although he was tired from the journey, his spirit was still very strong. After Mr. Yu stepped out of the station, he took the same car with Committee Member Yan Zhuang and his eldest daughter-in-law and drove directly to the Jiangsu Supervisory District Inspector's Office on Bixun Road to rest. At 4:20 PM, he met with reporters at the Inspector's Office and made a statement: "I came to Shanghai to generally observe the post-war situation. Before the 2nd year of the Republic, I was running a newspaper in Shanghai. I have been in Shanghai for more than forty years, so Shanghai is my second hometown." Before the war, Mr. Yu's residence was at No. 11 Jing'an Villa. On the afternoon of February 13, 27th year, it was raided by the enemy and his collection of documents and classics was lost.

<h3>Report of Arrest of Principal Offender in Mystery Bank Robbery Case Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) Regarding the report that Chen Yuancheng, the principal offender in the Central Bank's major robbery case, has been arrested in Zhenhai, the Huangpu Sub-bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately telegraphed the Zhenhai Police Bureau to inquire whether Chen Yuancheng had been arrested and requested an immediate reply. They received a reply stating that "the robber has been arrested and handed over to the Commissioner's Office," but the Central Bank also received a reply from the Zhenhai Office stating that "Chen Yuancheng's mother and younger brother have been arrested." The police bureau, after referring to the contents of the two telegrams, deemed that there was insufficient definite proof, and yesterday evening again urgently telegraphed the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office for detailed information. The original telegram was as follows: "Chen Yuancheng, the principal offender in the Central Bank's robbery case, was previously reported to have been arrested by the Zhenhai Police Bureau. After inquiring by telegram, we received a reply that the offender has been taken away by your office. However, we would like to know whether it is Chen Yuancheng himself or his family members. Please reply." This reporter visited the Huangpu Sub-bureau again last night and asked Section Chief Zhou Guanghui. He stated that a second reply had not been received, but today (the 3rd), the Central Bank again received a telegram from the Zhenhai Office stating that it was Chen Yuancheng's cousin Chen Yuanjun who had been arrested. Therefore, whether the protagonist of the case, Chen Yuancheng himself, has been definitely arrested remains to be confirmed by a telegram reply within the next few days.</p>

At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will automatically cooperate and avoid unclean cold drinks and be vaccinated with preventive shots.</p>

<h3>The Only Way to Save Industry: Labor and Management Must Work Together. Zhu Xuefan Proposes Establishing Cooperative Factories; Enthusiastic Discussion at Various Union Symposia</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal General Labor Union held a symposium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the main hall of the union's South City Penglai Road location, to discuss ways to save the national industrial crisis. Present were union leaders Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, and over two hundred representatives from various industry unions. Zhu Xuefan began by explaining the motivation for calling the meeting, stating: "Currently, the city's industry is facing a crisis. Workers, being the main sector of production, are closely related to this situation. After the victory, the workers hoped for construction, work, and food. However, existing industrialists feel it is difficult to maintain operations, while those who haven't started feel the future is bleak, and dare not try rashly. Employed workers cannot secure their livelihoods, while the unemployed demand work. It is the General Labor Union's duty to convene leaders from various unions to discuss and seek solutions." Zhu then reiterated Minister Gu and Mayor Wu's policies regarding the handling of labor-management disputes, and stated: "At this critical juncture, no worker wants factories to close down and cause unemployment; they only wish for factories to prosper and provide work. However, the current crisis, as mentioned by the person in charge of the silk industry association, is mainly due to: low exchange rates, the dominance of bureaucratic capital, high interest rates, inconvenient transportation, unstable domestic political situation, frequent labor strikes, etc. We workers, except for the responsibility for labor strikes, can do nothing about the other issues. At this time of severe industrial crisis, workers should frankly correct their own mistakes. Under Minister Gu's guidance, they should take responsibility, stop arbitrary strikes and work slowdowns, rectify discipline, increase production, and promote labor-management cooperation. Not only labor-management, but the government should also take responsibility, so that the government, labor, and management can cooperate to save this crisis. In today's world situation, there is no other way but cooperation and mutual benefit. Labor and management not only need to cooperate spiritually, but also need to move towards economic cooperation. Therefore, I propose establishing cooperative factories, to use cooperation to start idle machines and utilize wasted labor. Currently, suppressing prices and increasing production is one of the most important goals. Therefore, to solve the current industrial crisis, my opinion is that the government, labor, and management must cooperate."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Discussions on Two Topics Following this, under the chairmanship of Zhou Xuexiang, the discussion began. The topics were: (1) the causes of the national industrial crisis, and (2) how to save the national industrial crisis, divided into promoting labor-management cooperation and saving national industry. Representatives from various unions spoke enthusiastically, pointing out that the main causes of the current crisis were political instability, the ongoing civil war, transportation blockages, and the inability to return to normal, which affected production efficiency. Other factors such as the dumping of foreign goods, the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, the backwardness of production tools and technology, the low intellectual level of labor, high loan interest rates, and improper factory management also contributed to the industrial crisis. At this time, Zhu Xuefan stood up and said: "I hope that all speakers will discuss the current industrial crisis from a purely fair standpoint and with an objective attitude. The labor side should also frankly accept criticism, admit past mistakes, correct them, and show the attitude that workers in the new China should have, so that labor and management can thoroughly cooperate." Yesterday, the enthusiasm of the union representatives and their correct understanding showed great improvement. Finally, Shui Xiangyun summarized everyone's opinions and made a conclusion:</p>
<p>Causes of the National Industrial Crisis (A) The causes of the national industrial crisis include the following: 1. Political instability, 2. Backward production tools, 3. Lack of raw materials, 4. Dumping of foreign goods, 5. Monopoly of bureaucratic capital, 6. Transportation obstruction, 7. Currency inflation, 8. Excessive price fluctuations, 9.

(B) How to save the national industrial crisis: (1) Save the national industry with stable politics, (2) Strengthen agricultural production to increase raw material output, (3) Restore transportation, (4) Tighten the currency, (5) Regarding the issue of foreign goods dumping, A.

<p>Promote Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>(B) Promote Labor-Management Cooperation: (1) Accept the instructions of Minister Gu and Mayor Wu to implement sincere cooperation between labor and management, not to slow down work arbitrarily, and not to make excessive demands, but to maintain the legitimate interests of workers, (2) Factories must not arbitrarily close or suspend operations, (3) Wages should be announced every half month according to the cost of living index, (4) Carry out labor welfare activities, (5) Hold factory meetings, (6) Implement work competitions to reward workers (both materially and spiritually), (7) Actively carry out labor education, (8) Strengthen labor and management organizations, (9) Promote cooperative factories to rescue unemployed workers, (10) Improve workers' self-esteem and self-respect, and inspire self-reliance, and automatically abide by labor discipline, (11) Change the bad attitude of capitalists who discriminate against workers and hate unions, (12) When the factory's business is not good and wages are reduced, the reduced amount should be used as workers' shares, (13) Carefully select managers who understand the industrial technology and labor laws they manage, and who have appropriate experience to serve as managers, (14) Both labor and management should abide by the contract.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu Discusses Cooperation System to Solve Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Social Minister Gu Zhenggang gave many instructions to both industry, commerce, labor and management during his recent visit to Shanghai. On the second evening, Gu also broadcast a speech on the Cooperative Radio Station entitled "A Method to Solve the Current Unemployment Problem," advocating the establishment of a cooperative factory system. Gu stated that this new type of business structure was already indicated in the sixth plan of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China".</p>
<p>Cooperative factories can limit the expansion of private capital and eliminate labor-management antagonism. Capital will not become increasingly concentrated, and those who contribute labor will also share the surplus they deserve. Laborers will not be exploited by capital, and the distribution problem will be solved simultaneously in the production process. Cooperative factories can realize the goal of capital socialization. The capital invested by members will only be given a statutory profit, and a certain percentage of the surplus must be stored as a public fund. This public reserve is jointly owned by the members and cannot be divided. In this way, all the funds of the cooperative factory can gradually be changed from private ownership to public use. Cooperative factories can improve the daily lives of workers because they have the establishment of consumer cooperatives, public welfare funds, and educational funds, so that the material and spiritual lives of workers can be reasonably improved. The process of cooperative factory operation is to adopt a labor-management cooperation system in the first stage, transform it into a labor-management integration system in the second stage, and finally workers will own their own factories. The payment of workers' wages can adopt a system of in-kind distribution, so that workers' lives can be effectively guaranteed and not affected by price fluctuations. The purchase of raw materials and the promotion of products can be entrusted to the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Society Commodity Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs to handle it on their behalf. Its business operations can adopt either a single-operation system or a comprehensive operation system. The scale of organization should be able to accommodate at least one thousand or two thousand people per unit. Its operating procedures must start with raw materials that are relatively easy to purchase and products that are relatively easy to sell, in order to guarantee the development of the business. Today, the industrial construction of our country should be based on the cooperative system as an important foundation. In order to fundamentally solve labor disputes and to relieve unemployed workers, it is advocated to establish cooperative factories and to infiltrate the cooperative system into industry.</p>
<h3>Zongzi and Calamus Signify the Festival; Another Year Passes and It is Again the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>Zongzi, calamus, loquat - it's the Dragon Boat Festival again. A few days ago, the advertisements in the newspaper showed that each zongzi cost 350 yuan. Today, I went to a famous shop on Nanjing Road to ask, but each one costs 500 yuan.</p>
<p>In other words, the price of one zongzi is almost equal to one liter of white rice!</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said that there is no shortage of rice in Shanghai. The reason rice is expensive is because of "ghosts." The Dragon Boat Festival is when Zhong Kui slays ghosts. It is time to "slay" these "ghosts" who hoard and speculate.</p>
<p>Festivals are not without a kind of embellishment to everyone's life. Whether it is drinking realgar wine, hanging calamus on the door, or bringing out the "atomic snake" when singing the Legend of the White Snake, however, in this world of turmoil and famine, wouldn't it be better to eat a few less zongzi and help the compatriots who are currently eating tree bark?</p>

<h3>Policeman Embracing Celibacy Could Not Solve Life's Problems; Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Jing'an Temple Branch received a call from the Red Cross Society on Haig Road at about 1:30 AM yesterday, saying that a policeman had taken poison. The Criminal Division of the branch immediately sent plainclothes policemen Pei Anshou and Liu Ziyun to investigate. They learned that the person who took the poison was Chen Bingkang, a 24-year-old policeman from the Nanxiang Police Station in Jiading County, who committed suicide by drinking juice mixed with medicine. After the incident, his colleagues discovered it and rushed him to Nanxiang Hospital, but due to poor facilities, he could not be treated. He was then taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital. By the time he arrived at the hospital, it was too late, and Chen was already delirious and had difficulty breathing. He died at 5:50 PM. The body was sent to the morgue, and four suicide notes were found: (1) to Director Liu, (2) to Director Liu of Jiading, (3) to colleagues, (4) a self-description of the reasons. It generally said that he had always embraced celibacy, and now he only received 5,030 yuan in salary each month, while food expenses alone cost 6,000 yuan. He lacked the ability to turn things into gold, and could not maintain his life. He also said that he would rather die than be unfree, which caused this tragedy.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Barbershop employees in this city have made six demands to improve their living conditions, which are still being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. The industry's union convened a meeting of branch leaders on the first of this month to discuss solutions to the labor dispute, but unexpectedly, a member was stabbed and seriously injured, causing the situation to escalate further. More than 300 members of the union organized a "Justice Appeal Group" yesterday morning at 9:00 AM and marched to the Social Affairs Bureau to demand the arrest of the culprits and seek justice for the victims. Zhao Banfu, director of the bureau's labor division, met with the representatives and expressed his willingness to ask the Laozha District Branch to investigate the truth and promised to handle the matter fairly. Later, the members went to the Municipal Government to petition, demanding improvements in salary adjustments and profit-sharing with store owners, and requesting protection for members who have suffered accidental injuries. Mayor Wu enlightened them and allowed them to send representatives to present their case in person. All the petitioners immediately followed the order to leave the Municipal Government first, and three representatives met with the Mayor and handed over the petition. Mayor Wu immediately instructed that salary adjustments should be made according to the procedure, and that the Social Affairs Bureau should apply for mediation. If they were not satisfied, they could apply for arbitration. As for the unfortunate accidents suffered by members, he ordered the Police Bureau to investigate thoroughly and handle the matter. The representatives expressed their willingness to wait for a reasonable solution and then left.</p>

<h3>Municipal University Professors Association Pleads with Executive Yuan to Increase Salaries; Please Maintain the Recommendations Made by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The Shanghai University Professors Association stated that due to high prices, university professors are struggling to make a living, and that the proposed salary adjustment reported by the Executive Yuan does not even double the previous salary. They specifically requested the Executive Yuan to consider the facts and follow the recommendations of the Legislative Yuan in order to maintain education and reassure people. The original telegram reads: Premier Song and Deputy Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, since the victory, prices have soared, and professors' lives have become increasingly difficult. Their salaries are meager, and they are suffering from hunger and cold, struggling to make ends meet. The situation is miserable. They have had to endure it extremely, only because they are engaged in cultural and educational undertakings. The Legislative Yuan previously proposed a plan to adjust the salaries of public and educational personnel, and after hearing about it, they felt somewhat comforted in their hunger and thirst, but the delay continues to this day, and even this minimum recommendation has not been passed. The proposals made by the Chief and Minister Chen in yesterday's report do not even double the previous salary, which is a drop in the bucket, and the public is panicked. They dare to submit this report again, hoping that you will consider the facts and pass the proposed bill of the Legislative Yuan in order to maintain education and reassure people. Respectfully submit this telegram, and eagerly await your order. Shanghai University Professors Association bows.</p>
<h3>Wuhan University Professors Make Two Suggestions; Universities Should Not Be Established If Funding is Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Leshan, Sichuan] The National University Professors Association made two suggestions to the education authorities in Wuhan regarding the issue of professor salaries: (1) The establishment of a university must be worthy of the name. If funding is insufficient, it should not be established. If established, the funding and equipment must meet the standards required by a modern university. The government's approved educational budget and additional funding should be based on this principle, and the total amount of funding required by universities across the country each year, as well as the total amount of additional funding that should be added due to rising prices, should be statistically determined, and the designated funds should be deposited in the national treasury and distributed in installments. Each school's equipment and research expenses should account for at least 50% of the annual expenses and must not be used for other purposes. (2) Professor salaries should be as proposed by the Shanghai National College Professors' Association, with specific standards that are adjusted at any time. The adjustment method should be based on the cost of living index. Professor's income should be able to provide them with (1) support for their families, (2) education for their children, (3) purchase of necessary private books and research equipment.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Professors' Declaration Demands Secret Methods to Improve Treatment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou] The National Zhejiang University Professors Association recently issued a declaration to demand improved treatment, stating briefly: (1) The nature of professors' work is special, and their treatment should be established according to different standards. (2) The calculation standards should be directly based on the cost of living index. (3) Increase research funding. Academic research funding should be included in the national annual budget. These demands are not limited to one corner, one place, one academy, or one school, but are universal demands across the country. The misery of the professors' living conditions is definitely not limited to one corner, one place, one academy, or one school, but is a universal phenomenon across the country. (Li)</p>

<h3>Three Specialized Schools in Hunan Province Request to Merge with Keqiang College to Establish Keqiang University</h3>
<p>[Changsha Dispatch from the Great China News Agency] The Hunan Provincial Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Specialized Schools, established in the autumn of the thirtieth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1941], have cultivated many talents. However, due to the short duration of study, they repeatedly requested the Education Department to be approved to be upgraded to a college or merged into a complete university. In May of the thirty-third year [i.e. 1944], they received an order from the Ministry of Education to be reorganized into an independent college, but for other reasons, it did not materialize. Recently, because people from Hunan Province in Hubei Province proposed to establish Keqiang College in Wuchang, the students of the three schools greatly hoped to merge with it to form Keqiang University. Therefore, the agricultural and industrial schools, together with the commercial school, each elected representatives, and more than one hundred alumni from the provincial capital organized a petition group to visit Chairman Wang, Speaker Zhao, Deputy Speaker Tang, Secretary-General Liu, Director Wang, and others to petition.

According to Huxley, the representative of the British side and Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Committee, "This organization is still in the preparatory stage, and its only task is to create a sound staff. It will not be able to fully deploy its work before the Paris Conference in November." In addition, according to the American representative Thompson, "Seven countries, including Britain, France, New Zealand, Mexico, India, and Syria, have already passed the constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, and others will also endorse it." Dr. Brownell (female), the American representative, said, "After the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is approved, it must be made sound. If the organization itself is weak, it will inevitably lead to tragedy. We would rather not have this organization than disappoint the world. As a traveler and not a pessimist, I actually have extremely optimistic expectations for this organization and firmly believe that the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization will become a genuine tool for contact between the peoples of the world."</p>

<h3>Unprecedentedly Grand Basketball Match: Hualian Wins Over Kunyu by One Point; Tense and Exciting Result: 48 to 46</h3>
<p>The Kunyu basketball team played its fourth match in Shanghai last night. In an extremely tense situation, it lost to the champion Hualian team of this city by one point. The result was 48 to 46. In the first half, Hualian led by 28 to 24. The Kunyu team's performance has greatly improved, and the match was quite exciting, but the overall situation was controlled by Hualian. The performance of Li Zhenzhong and Wang Nanzhen was the best. Last night, the audience flocked to the venue, and the gymnasium was packed with people, estimated to be around 4,000. The "sold out" sign was hung up before the game started, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand.</p>
<p>Hualian started with Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, and Bo Tuo. Kunyu started with Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, Tang Baokun, Wang Nanzhen, and Ren Xiangcheng.

Chengzhang, Zhenzhong, and Botuo were accurate in every shot, and instantly took a remote lead of 10 to 3. The visiting team called a timeout, secretly discussed a plan, and indeed Xiangcheng and Yanxiong both scored, but Hualian was still rampant, 23 to 9, which was Hualian's golden age. After that, the visiting team's momentum gradually increased, and the score approached. When Dayun scored, the first half ended, and Hualian led by 28 to 24 with two points ahead.</p>

Xiangcheng and Yanxiong worked together and chased to a tie of 30 points each. The situation gradually became tense. When Dayun scored a wonderful shot, the visiting team took the lead for the first time, 30 to 30. The battle became a seesaw, and the scores rose and fell alternately, tying at 35, 37, and 39. Hualian's Zhenzhong reappeared, and Liangxiong withdrew. Zhenzhong scored twice, Guangyi scored from afar, 46 to 40, and Hualian took the lead again. Kunyu's Liang Yunming replaced Dayun, and Dayun re-entered, and it became a tie of 46 again.

<h3>Replies to Readers - Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>(1) Sun Zhenyuan asks Editor: My father passed away early, and my mother is illiterate. I am young and working for a living in Suzhou, unfamiliar with social conditions. Therefore, I respectfully inquire: Before the War of Resistance, we originally resided in the Nanshi area of Shanghai. During the "August 13th" Incident, we fled to the former French Concession. The following year, the situation in Nanshi improved, and refugees returned in droves. However, the landlord said, "It has already been occupied and registered by someone." My mother protested and checked the old residence, finding it indeed occupied and our furniture and belongings being used. After inquiring from various sources, we learned that this person was a henchman of enemy spies. We had no choice but to endure in silence. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, with the return of peace, the people should be able to live and work in peace. However, the occupier remains. Therefore, I specifically inquire: (1) How can we prevent them from reselling the furniture? (2) How can we make them move out and compensate for the furniture that has already been stolen and sold? Please provide a detailed reply.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The owner of the furniture should present concrete evidence or proof of ownership to reclaim their property or prevent others from disposing of it without permission. If preventing this is ineffective, they can request the court to eliminate the infringement. (2) (A) If you have a legitimate lease right to the house, you can demand that the person forcibly occupying it vacate or request the court to order them to move out. If the lease relationship has been interrupted, you should first contact the lessor to restore it. (B) The person who stole and sold the furniture is liable for compensation. The victim should collect evidence of the theft and negotiate with the thief. If this is ineffective, they can bring a lawsuit in court.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Yurong asks Editor: I have several questions. Please have your legal advisor provide guidance: (1) On what legal basis does the government protect second-hand landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent? (2) The second-hand landlord of this house changed from Huang to Miao. In the winter of 1943, they privately transferred the lease. Is this legally binding? (3) After the government’s restoration, did the Shanghai Municipal Government announce regulations abolishing the qualifications of second-hand landlords and increasing rent, or was this only applicable between primary landlords and second-hand landlords?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The government does not have any laws protecting second-hand landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent. (2) A second-hand landlord's private transfer of a leased house is not legally binding. If the transfer was not approved by the primary landlord, the primary landlord can terminate the lease based on this. (3) (A) Upon investigation, this city has no laws abolishing the qualifications of second-hand landlords. (B) The standard for collecting rent in this city applies to the general relationship between lessors and lessees.</p>
<p>(3) A reader from Jiangwan asks: I have been running a small business in Jiangwan Town. At the beginning of the occupation, the local tycoons all became "new nobles" and established "cooperatives," forcing donations from every household, claiming that members could enjoy fair prices. Although we saw daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches being transported in, we never managed to buy any. After the victory, the "new nobles" became new figures again. When I casually inquired about the past, they claimed that all the cooperative members were collaborators and had no right to speak. However, the president and directors embezzled the goods, sold them on the black market, and made a fortune, while no one dared to ask questions, and they even scolded people for being collaborators. I am truly resentful. I don't know whether being forced to join a puppet cooperative as a member and never receiving any enemy or puppet goods makes me a collaborator and traitor. Do I have any crime or right to speak? Seeking your guidance.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] Being forced to join a puppet cooperative as a member and never receiving any enemy or puppet goods cannot be considered collaboration and treason, nor does it constitute a criminal charge. Cooperative members legally have the right to speak on cooperative affairs.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Answer to Legal Inquiries - Letter from Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the various "Legal Inquiries" questions answered by this lawyer on May 27th, the answer concerning Mr. Xu Gongmao's question was misplaced due to the numerous questions. The corrected answer is as follows: "When voluntarily recovering the repayment in the future and retrieving the IOU, according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration promulgated on December 18, 1945, if, due to reasons not attributable to the party, circumstances change unexpectedly and fairness is manifestly lost based on the original effect, the court should fairly consider increasing or decreasing the payment." I hope this will be published immediately to resolve the inquirer's doubts and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin of the Shen Bao Social Services Department, May 28th.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>"Resumption of Operations" and "Repayment of Principal" Rumors Abound - Government Bonds Soar and Plummet - Unusually Tight Funds and Unfavorable Environment - Neither Chinese nor Foreign Stocks Show Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for government bonds initially saw Tong Bing bonds rise from 6700 yuan to over 7000 yuan due to news of the resumption of stock exchange operations. However, soon afterward, due to rumors of using customs gold for government bond repayment, many rushed to sell, and the situation eased. Around noon, it fell to 5500 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it closed 900 yuan lower than last Saturday. After closing, there were rumors of it falling to 5400 yuan and then rising to 5900 yuan. Chinese stocks followed the same downward trend as government bonds. At the opening, they rose slightly due to the optimism surrounding the resumption of trading. Yong Yarn rose to 6070 yuan, Meiya to 4550 yuan, Jingfu to 310 yuan, Xinguang to 300 yuan, and Qinxing to 238 yuan. Later, the banks experienced unusually tight funds. A large amount of sealed materials was distributed during the day, further tightening credit. Many were discouraged, and prices gradually declined in the afternoon, closing at lower prices. The declines in Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Qinxing were slight compared to last Saturday, while Xinguang and Jingfu each fell by half a percent. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks declined again. Afternoon bidding prices were slightly higher. Foreign stocks were stable at the opening, with Ewo Yarn hovering around 12400 yuan. However, news of the resumption of operations could not withstand the unfavorable real environment. Demand became slightly erratic, and different stocks reacted differently. The popular Ewo Yarn retreated slightly to around last Saturday's closing price. By the afternoon, the rise and fall of various stocks varied compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Selling Occurs at Every High Point - Rayon Prices Decline Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price for 120-day bridge rayon was 1.345 million yuan in the morning and 1.33 million yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 45,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Rayon has been weak for several days because large amounts are sold off whenever the price is good, causing the market price to weaken gradually. Factory transactions were quiet, but prices remained firm. Yesterday, 74/75 evenness was traded by foreign firms at a price of 2.1 million yuan. Dry-spun Hangzhou prices were lower, and the Shanghai market also decreased by 45,000 yuan yesterday. Mesh goods from Meiya and bedding were 10,000 yuan higher than on Saturday. Dachang checked crepe opened at 4,330 yuan and eventually traded at 4,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Around the Festival - Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Transactions are Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yarn market prices were weak and transactions were scarce. Because of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival today, buyers were hesitant. Those under pressure from tight credit had no choice but to lower prices to sell. Thus, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 70-80,000 yuan, while 20-count Double Horse and small and medium-sized yarns fell by 10-20,000 yuan each. Only the Nanjing gang showed some interest in buying. Sentiment was extremely flat. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, with prices marked down 20-30,000 yuan compared to the previous session. However, 80-count single Bull Head thread saw a huge price drop of 100,000 yuan from the price opened last Friday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegrams continued to rise by 6 to 12 points. Near-term American dollars were priced at 28.17, far-term at 28.69, and current Mitchell at 28.77. The local Shanghai cotton market situation was firm. However, due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, manufacturers were somewhat hesitant, resulting in poor transactions. High-grade Mitchell delivered to factories traded at 106,000 yuan, an increase of about 10-20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, cloth market purchases were not as strong as the previous day, so fewer buyers were present. Gray cloth prices fell by 500 yuan. However, Shirting cloth remained stable due to the season. Provinces such as Sichuan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Tianjin continued to purchase winter goods.</p>
<h3>Luxury Goods - Foreign Exchange Settlement Not Allowed</h3>
<p>The Central Bank has noted that in recent months, imports have been increasing, especially luxury goods, which not only affect the development of our country's industry but also cause capital outflow. Therefore, it has ordered all Chinese and foreign foreign exchange banks and money shops to stop settling foreign exchange for luxury goods. The Ministry of Finance has also issued an order to customs to absolutely prohibit the import of luxury goods.</p>
<h3>Yang Jinsheng to Visit Japan Again - To Discuss Barter Trade with MacArthur - Sino-Korean Trade Agreement to be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>Post-war Japan needs our country to supply a great deal of materials. The Executive Yuan sent Yang Jinsheng, Deputy Manager of the Barter Trade Department of the Central Trust Bureau, as a special commercial commissioner to Tokyo to discuss matters with General MacArthur's headquarters and to prepare for commercial activities in Japan. The results were excellent. After Yang returned to China, he shipped salt and wheat bran to Japan and used the proceeds to purchase mulberry seedlings, silkworm eggs, sleepers, coal mining equipment, and machine parts, totaling more than 60,000 tons. However, due to the unstable situation in the Northeast, goods such as soybeans needed by Japan could not be shipped out, and salt from Huai Lu in North China could not be transported due to the situation. Japan is now requesting to purchase 800,000 tons of salt from us, but due to labor, fuel, and transportation costs, we currently plan to supply only 300,000 tons. Special Commissioner Yang is scheduled to visit Japan again at the end of this month to inspect the situation and discuss various barter trade matters with Mr. Yan Enwei, Director of the Economic Affairs Section of our country's delegation to Japan, at General MacArthur's headquarters. However, our country does not currently have many goods to export to Japan. It is reported that the goods shipped back from Japan will be fresh and dry cocoons, cotton textiles, and industrial equipment to meet domestic needs.</p>
<p>In other news, China and South Korea are working hard to develop trade. Regarding trade between China and South Korea, a trade agreement will be established. Mr. Shao Yulin, Head of our military delegation to South Korea, is currently negotiating with the Korean government. Mr. Shao will be responsible for signing the Sino-Korean trade agreement.</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Festival Holiday</h3>
<p>Today is the traditional Dragon Boat Festival. People traditionally hang mugwort and burn calamus to commemorate the national poet. All industries will also be closed for the holiday as usual, and all markets will cease operations for one day.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Sees More Arrivals Than Sales - Prices Continue to Fall by 1,000 to 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market remained sluggish today, with prices continuing to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White rice saw better sales due to the Dragon Boat Festival, forming a stable pattern. Yellow beans were flat and weak, while corn saw no activity from buyers, falling by over 1,000 yuan. New broad beans arrived from various regions in large quantities, causing prices to plummet by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Flour rebounded slightly by 600 to 700 yuan. Soybean cakes were being sold off aggressively, falling sharply by 700 to 800 yuan. The Shantou market was extremely sluggish, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. According to the rice market, the amount of rice arriving in the city today included seven types such as japonica rice, totaling over 10,000 shi: 3,749 shi of white japonica, 1,812 shi of thin indica, 1,202 shi of early indica, 733 shi of Yangxian, 109 shi of Shexian, 2,000 shi of Wuxian, and 589 shi of white yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Request Increased Profits - Implementation Postponed After Consideration</h3>
<p>The retail rice shops belonging to the Shanghai Rice Industry Association originally stipulated a profit of 6% per shi when selling rice. However, recently, due to rising prices and high expenses, members requested an increase in profits to 8%. This was approved by the members' meeting and was about to be implemented. However, after careful consideration by the association, it was decided to postpone implementation.</p>
<h3>Fine Mei Tea Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The Tianjin gang will collect green flower tea.</p>
<p>Fine Mei and Needle Mei teas, which are exclusively sold to Africa and Morocco, are currently being negotiated by Jardine Matheson with the suppliers. However, both sides are very firm in their stance, so not many agreements have been reached. However, the market sentiment is excellent. The price of Fine Mei has risen compared to last week, while Needle Mei remains firm. As for various domestic sales teas, although the local shops and buyers from other regions are interested, they are not interested in buying or selling during the Dragon Boat Festival. Therefore, transactions are limited. According to news from the Tianjin gang, they plan to accept all green flower tea without rejection after the festival.</p>
<h3>Grain and Goods Loan Program Concludes</h3>
<p>According to news from the Four Banks Joint Office, the grain merchant loan program launched by the office in April has been terminated early due to poor performance. The names of the rice merchants who received loans are as follows: Ersantai, Wu Rongsheng, Zhifeng, Xu Taiyuan, Huifeng, Wang Yuzhen, Wanchangxin, Yang Runshe, Tongyi Company, Lu Linxun, Hengtaifeng, Zhang Chao, Fukang, Shao Jigao, Yongshuntai, Gu Yisheng, Qianchangyu, Yu Liangji, Jiangbei Company, Xing Songwen, Xiedaheng, Feng Yongsheng, Xinchang, Zhu Yongming, Xiechangtai, Zhu Shilu, Tongcheng Company, Fu Changyu, Yangtze River Enterprise Company, Wang Xunzhi. A total of 15 companies, each receiving a grain loan of 60 million yuan, totaling 900 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Shows Slight Increase - Anthracite Coal Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>The coal market saw the previous trends continue for anthracite coal. Actual sales are difficult to improve for the time being, and prices are hovering around a weak level. Bituminous coal dust is being actively purchased by factories, resulting in a shortage of actual goods and a continued rise in market prices. Bituminous coal chunks are following suit, with asking prices rising rapidly. Fortunately, actual sales are limited, and the increase is still slight. Charcoal is slightly weak due to the upcoming festival, but retail sales are still unwilling to lower prices.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Raises Cocoon Prices - Top Grade at 180,000 Yuan - Medium Grade at 130,000</h3>
<p>The China Silk Corporation has set up cocoon collection points in Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiaxing, Wujiang, and other places, setting price standards based on the quality of the cocoons. It is reported that the purchasing price for the best quality cocoons has been raised to 180,000 yuan per dan, while the medium grade is also around 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to actively improve the quality of raw silk, the Jiangsu Silk Improvement Zone has established a method for handling cocoons and has notified farmers to adopt the following three measures:</p>
<p>(1) Do not use sunlight to dry cocoons to avoid degrading the quality of good cocoons. (2) Do not use good cocoons to reel native silk to avoid lowering the selling price and reducing income. Use new silk reeling machines to produce good raw silk. (3) Do not retain native breeds to avoid affecting cocoons and raw silk.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Arrives in Succession - Local Cotton Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Recently, a cotton yarn magnate stated that after the war, a large amount of American cotton has been imported. The selling price is not higher than that of domestic cotton, and the quality is better. Therefore, most manufacturers prefer to buy American cotton, greatly affecting the sales of domestic cotton. As for the cotton-producing areas in North China and Northwest China, transportation difficulties and high freight costs make the cost of shipping cotton to Shanghai higher than that of American cotton. Therefore, very little cotton is shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned areas. Moreover, the provinces of North China and Northwest China have been plagued by banditry for years, and production has also sharply decreased. It is hoped that the government will take effective relief measures to avoid the collapse of Chinese cotton.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Formulates Loan Standards to Aid Commercially Owned Damaged Ships</h3>
<p>During the war, commercially owned ships suffered damage, directly or indirectly, due to the war. Those requesting government loans for relief are located in Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. A total of 286 steamships, 118 sailboats, and 15 pontoons are awaiting repair. The total amount of loans requested is approximately 2 billion yuan. The relief method is to provide low-interest loans from national banks. Regarding the standards for loans, it is learned that the Ministry of Communications has formulated the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) The standards for approving loans for ships are: 1) over 102 tons, 2) under 20 years old, 3) registered with the maritime administration, 4) repair costs not exceeding 70% of the ship's construction cost. (2) Supervision and auditing of loans for ship repairs will be handled by the local maritime administration or by the local government entrusted by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>(3) The loan source will be requested by the Ministry of Finance from the Executive Yuan for allocation by the Four Banks Joint Office.</p>
<p>(4) The repayment period should not exceed five years.</p>
<h3>Shuttleless Weaving - Automatic Eight Hours - No Human Supervision Needed</h3>
<p>The Biddle Mill factory in the United Kingdom is using shuttleless looms to manufacture fabrics. This new machine can manufacture fabrics that ordinary looms cannot manufacture. It can continuously weave stone wool raw materials without noise or vibration. It is said that a skilled worker and an assistant can easily supervise 24 shuttleless looms. This machine has automatically woven canvas for eight hours without any workers present. If a suitable warp is used, it can continue weaving for 24 hours without stopping.</p>
<h3>Higher Prices in Other Cities, Buying by Out-of-Town Buyers - Gold Market Turns from Weak to Firm - US Dollars Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Gold remained difficult to support yesterday. Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, various industries urgently needed to settle debts, resulting in oversupply. The opening price was 1.8 million yuan, but it was soon suppressed by multiple liquidations. At the same time, buyers were hesitant due to distribution price issues, falling below 1.78 million yuan. The Central Bank distributed 57 bars at a price of 1.775 million yuan. There was little change afterward, and it fell again to 1.76 million yuan at noon. The afternoon started flat, but as the next-day settlement opened, it rose slightly to around 1.79 million yuan. However, the market price changed again after 4 PM because gold prices rebounded in other cities. Buyers from Suzhou and Wuxi bought, and finally broke through the 1.8 million yuan mark, resulting in an increase of about 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Ornament gold rose from 188,000 yuan to 192,000 yuan. Silver bullion was flat, while silver dollars fell slightly. The underground money market tightened due to external influences, and interest rates rose from 15% to 20%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, US dollars, was mediocre. The process was slightly more stable than the gold market. It fell slightly from 2,340 yuan at the beginning of the morning to 2,320 yuan. It continued to struggle at this price at noon and in the afternoon. The result was a slight decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were boosted by telegraphic transfers, rising 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were affected by the shrinkage of Hong Kong port telegrams, with sellers offering 435 yuan. Rupees also rose to 528 yuan before being sold, but transactions were not numerous. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Overdue Goods in Customs Warehouse - Extension Granted Until the End of August</h3>
<p>Many imported goods currently stored in the Jianghai Customs warehouse have not completed import procedures. According to regulations, the storage period in the customs warehouse must not exceed 12 months. Most of the aforementioned goods stored in the warehouse have exceeded the deadline, which has already been extended to June 30th of this year. It is heard that the Customs Administration is sympathetic to the situation of merchants and fears that they will still be unable to complete the procedures by the deadline. Therefore, it has granted another extension until August 31st.</p>
<h3>Kunming Bank - Shanghai Branch Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Kunming Commercial Bank was established in 1940, with its head office in Kunming City, Yunnan Province. Chairman Long Chunwu is a well-known financial entrepreneur in Yunnan. Over the years, he has devoted himself to promoting the government's wartime economic construction policies in the rear area during the War of Resistance. Therefore, the business is developed and the reputation is outstanding. Recently, the bank was approved by the Ministry of Finance to open a branch in this city. Mr. Hu Bowen has been appointed as the manager of the Shanghai branch. It is heard that the branch address has been selected at 329 Shandong Road and will officially open on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>2,000 Jeeps - Can Arrive in Shanghai Next Week - US$2,700 per Vehicle</h3>
<p>The 2,000 jeeps ordered by various agencies and organizations in this city have been loaded onto ships in the United States and are expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. The price is set at US$2,700 per vehicle. It is heard that after the vehicles arrive in Shanghai, they will be assembled at Longhua Airport before being distributed to various customers.</p>
<h3>Copper Scarcity: Europe and America are Both Facing Shortages; US Price Controls May Be Raised</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Although the United States has purchased 30,000 tons of copper from Chile in the first half of this year, the copper shortage has not eased. In the first quarter of this year, the United Kingdom imported 38,700 tons from Rhodesia, Canada, and the Belgian Congo, while exporting only 10,200 tons. The remaining 28,500 tons are reserved for consumption this quarter. Estimated demand for this year is around 74,700 tons. At the end of 1945, the government originally intended to store 123,000 tons, but compared to last year's reserves of 300,000 tons, the difference is significant. By the end of March last year, reserves had already decreased to below 80,000 tons. The United Kingdom has already suspended copper exports since February. The quantity in March was only 72 tons. Given the current consumption rate, even with the 30,000 tons from Chile and other imports, it is still difficult to maintain the current deficit level. The purchasing contract with Chile was originally signed in the past, with a price significantly lower than the current £72 per ton. Therefore, the upward trend in world copper prices is causing anxiety for the British government. It is reported that French New Records has purchased a batch from the United States at a price of £82 per ton, which is approximately equal to the £78 paid for Chilean copper that has already been delivered. The US price control may be raised from 12.25 cents per pound to 14 cents (equivalent to £78 per ton). Before the government reaches a satisfactory agreement with various imperial producers, the price of copper in the UK should not be raised immediately. Given the current intense competition from aluminum and the general belief that the copper shortage will not last long, the current upward trend in copper prices will soon become clear. Imperial producers should prioritize securing long-term guarantees in the British market and should not haggle over pennies during this abnormal temporary shortage.</p>
<h3>Refined Granulated Sugar Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in prices as the Dragon Boat Festival approached, resulting in weaker demand. Additionally, company stocks were being released. The spot market saw an increase in inventory, leading to a price correction. The Sugar Association set the benchmark price for refined granulated sugar at 71,500 to 71,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 yuan. Company warehouse receipts were priced at 69,000 to 69,500 yuan, down by 1,000 yuan. Dealer prices for Dianhua white sugar opened at 74,000 yuan, then decreased to 72,000 to 68,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was priced at 61,500 yuan, then decreased to 61,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Approves Free Purchase of Copper, Tin, Lead, Aluminum, and Other Minerals</h3>
<p>The Resource Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has received a notification from the Executive Yuan, stating that from the 11th of this month, merchants and civilians across the country can freely purchase and transport tin, copper, lead, aluminum, nickel, zinc, gypsum, mica, asbestos, and other minerals. Furthermore, from this date, no export permits are required for the transportation and export of these minerals.</p>
<h3>Status of Clearing House Affiliation Undecided</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in this city is imminent. Whether the Clearing House will be independent in the future or affiliated with the aforementioned institution is a matter of concern for many. It is understood that before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Clearing House was managed by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry. After the victory, the Financial Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance instructed both the banking and money industries to jointly manage it under the supervision of the Central Bank. The future organization and any changes will be determined after the official establishment of the Joint Reserve Committee.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Export Permits Expire at the End of July</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 3rd] The Bombay Export Control Office published a notice in the newspapers stating that export permits for raw cotton, whether already issued or pending issuance, will be valid until July 31, 1946.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to grain industry sources, new wheat from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been entering the market successively for a month. Grain merchants have already transported some to this city, and the purchase price is quite low, greatly benefiting the city's food supply.</p>
<h3>Xing Fourth Yuan Slightly Loosens</h3>
<p>The price of Xinghua Osmanthus cakes has loosened slightly due to continuous sales in recent days. Xing Fourth Yuan opened at 192,000 yuan, while Big Bubble Yuan remained at 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Observer Urges Textile Industry to Innovate Equipment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 3rd] Mr. Windle Barton, a former British observer attached to the US textile delegation to Japan, told a Reuters correspondent yesterday that the Dutch textile industry, in order to restore its past prosperity, must renovate its equipment and adopt a two-shift system. The cost should not be considered a problem. The United States is working hard to develop in this way. If the United States can do it, why can't the United Kingdom? In terms of cotton and rayon, we should also regard Japan as a competitor.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Woolen Fabrics Decrease</h3>
<p>The actual sales of woolen fabrics have decreased recently. As a result, the standard market prices at the Public Tea House have trended towards stagnation. Inspections of tailors selling ready-made Chinese garments on Qipan Street and Western-style tailors on Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, Lin Road, and Hubei Road all reveal exceptionally slow business. The fifth and sixth months of the lunar calendar have always been a phenomenon in previous years, and the high cost of labor is also a factor. Before the war, the fabric for a Western suit cost 12 yuan in legal tender, and the labor cost 8 yuan. Now, labor costs are higher than the fabric. The fabric only costs 120,000 yuan, while the labor costs 150,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank and Money Shop Deposits Reach Over 79 Billion in Five Months</h3>
<p>The business of banks and money shops in this city has been normal for the past five months, and the situation is very stable. As of the end of last month, the total amount of deposits in all banks and shops in the city reached over 79 billion yuan in national currency. The deposit reserve funds deposited by each bank and shop in the Central Bank totaled approximately 18 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Increases Deposit Interest Rates; Both Fixed and Current Accounts Increase</h3>
<p>In order to expand its business and encourage depositors to actively deposit, the Bank of China has decided to increase interest rates on fixed deposits and special current deposits by 25% and 40% respectively at the time of this settlement of interest (June 20) to show special consideration.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Buds Becoming Scarce</h3>
<p>Due to the gradual depletion of inventory and limited supply in the market, the market price of dried lily buds continues to rise. Yesterday, the top-grade goods in the market rose by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, reaching a price of 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>Cotton Fabrics: Sweatshirts and socks with counts of 80 or higher are scarce due to a shortage of raw materials. The China Textile Company has also not released any stocks, and existing inventory is dwindling day by day, so prices are trending towards firmness. Due to the hot weather, "Smarto" shirts are selling slowly, and Hong Kong shirts have regained popularity. Although factory prices have not fallen, the market price is 155,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: The upward trend continues. Solacin tablets have slightly decreased in price due to factory shipments. Ampoules of Anteler and Dolantin are being hoarded, and prices have been driven up again.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Wuku brand laundry soap has larger distribution volume from the factory, while Arrow, Huang Xiangmao and other soaps are under pressure. Phoenix Ningbo matches and candles are still selling well, and prices are firm.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Old Knife, Pins, and other brands from British American Tobacco are being purchased vigorously by buyers from Beijing and Hankou, and prices are brisk. The prices of Chinese-made cigarettes are mixed.</p>
<p>Leather: Raw yellow cattle hides and yellow-faced leather are both declining. However, American MST yellow-grain leather remains firm due to shortages. The rest is mediocre, and transactions are sparse.</p>
<p>Dyes: Black electric powder (2.07 million) was transacted, and Samsung grey and Daqiao Zhu continued to be popular, and the market is trending firmer.</p>
<p>Hardware: Market conditions are mixed, with ups and downs. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and the market is quite slow.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials: Caustic soda continues to rise, and soda ash and soda also follow suit. Bleaching powder has rebounded slightly. Vaseline and white oil are relatively stable.</p>
<p>Bristles: The market remains sluggish, with few inquiries, and it is difficult for prices to improve.</p>
<h3>Pig Bristles Mostly Shipped to the United States; Export Volume in March and April</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stated that the export volume of pig bristles concentrated in the Shanghai market that had been inspected and certified by the bureau in March and April was 5,399 dan in March and 4,489 dan in April. Among them, the quantity shipped to New York City in the United States was the largest, and the quantity shipped to London was very small. The pig bristles gathered in Shanghai mainly came from Chongqing and Wuhan. There was also a small amount of production from the local area and the suburbs. The packaging method was all wooden boxes, which were rectangular, 26 1/4 inches long, 20 inches wide, and 12-14 inches high. The inside of the box was lined with oil paper, and each bundle of pig bristles was wrapped in clean white paper, with the factory's trademark and measurement noted. When packing, camphor powder was applied between each bundle of pig bristles to prevent insects. Each box weighed about 120 catties, and the number of pig bristles in each box varied depending on the length, ranging from 200 to 400 bundles.</p>

<h3>Haimen is Advancing</h3>
<p>— Haimen Communication, May 28th, by Jifeng</p>
<p>Haimen County, separated from Shanghai by the Yangtze River and adjacent to Nantong in Jiangbei, is not the well-known Zhejiang commercial port of Haimen. Before introducing the situation of a county, the reporter must first introduce the person in charge of the county. County Magistrate Liu Daoping is a burly man, not yet forty years old. It is said that during the War of Resistance, he was a secretary under General Tang Enbo. He possesses the qualities that a county magistrate should have: shrewdness, strength, integrity, and democracy.</p>
<p>A Delaying Tactic Scares Away the Communist Army</p>
<p>At the end of April, the Communist army launched an "offensive" in northern Jiangsu. During the crisis in Haimen County, County Magistrate Liu did not leave the county government and used a clever plan to resolve the siege, which was widely praised. When the Communist army approached the county seat, the National army was few in number and difficult to resist. Reinforcements were slow to arrive. The county magistrate, in his quick thinking, secretly ordered residents overnight to go to a designated location at dawn the next day to welcome the main force of the three regiments of the National army, which had landed at Qinglong Port to reinforce the county. The matter was learned by Communist army spies, and the approaching troops quietly retreated. A day later, reinforcements arrived, and the county seat was safe.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Liu also attaches great importance to education. Considering the decline of teachers and the unevenness of their qualifications after the war, he first focused on the selection of primary school teachers. He is harmonious and sincere towards his subordinates, and he never allows any delay in governing the county. He personally reviews the county government's economic revenue and expenditure every day, which are absolutely transparent.</p>
<p>One County, Two Worlds</p>
<p>Speaking of the public security of Haimen County, it is truly sigh-worthy. After so long since the victory, only four towns and strongholds in Haimen County have been taken over by the National army: Haimen County, Tianbu Town, Qinglong Port, and San Chang Town. There, everything is heading towards the path of recovery, people's lives are guaranteed, and actions are free. The government's decree to ban opium has also been vigorously promoted by the police station using the Baojia system, with registration, investigation, summons, and detoxification... all handled with the utmost effort. In contrast, in the areas controlled by the Communist army, most of the local bullies, ruffians, and idlers have become "militiamen," holding a "fork" (a type of weapon) in their hands, pretending to be "heroes." A "guerrilla group" with a pistol and a few grenades is like a living Yama. Murder and robbery are specially permitted by their "superiors." People who are killed are always regarded as "National spies" or "stubborn elements." Robbing people's money is rightfully considered "communization." The former village chiefs have all been scared away and have fled to Nantong, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and other places. As a result, cattle herders became village chiefs, and illiterate peasants became township heads. There are small meetings every three days and large meetings every five days, "gathering them by beating drums and summoning them by striking wood." The rich have indeed been "communized." Even the real farmers who cannot live without working for a day are also disturbed and cannot rest.</p>
<p>The Cultural World is Heading Towards Revival</p>
<p>There is one county-run middle school, one privately-run middle school, and one church-run (Catholic Church) middle school in the county. The private Haimen Middle School, formerly known as Pudong Middle School, once enjoyed a reputation in the education world. Although the school building was destroyed in the bombing, it is now being presided over by the original principal, Mr. Cai Yinen, and classes have resumed in the Zhongshan Hall in the county seat. The above schools are concentrated in the county seat because there are more houses and guarantees there. Most of the teachers are wealthy scholars and veterans who have served in the education field for a long time. Each town and village has one or two primary schools, with mostly complete primary schools in the towns and mostly elementary primary schools in the villages. This spring, the county government ordered all primary schools in the county to be renamed National Schools to earnestly implement national education. However, the primary schools are scattered in various places, most of which are still in areas controlled by the Communist army. What kind of effect the county government's hard work can achieve is unpredictable.</p>
<p>After the victory, the Haimen newspapers included the newly established New Haimen Daily and the re-established Jianghai Daily. The county regards these two newspapers as the mouthpiece of the people. Unfortunately, both newspapers are too small in size, and the printing is outsourced to a printing shop, so there are often missing lead characters. In this environment of unequal supply and demand and inadequate equipment, the appearance of these two newspapers can be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>The county has one public library, which is adjacent to the county government. Unfortunately, many books have been lost in the chaos of war, and very few remain.</p>
<p>Industry is Primarily Based on Cotton Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>There were originally two factories in industrial production: one was the Dasheng Third Textile Company, also known as Dasheng Third Factory, in Sanchang Town, which produced yarn and cloth with trademarks such as "Kui Xing," which sold well throughout the country and enjoyed an excellent reputation. The other was the Yisheng Brewing Winery in Changle Town, the hometown of Zhang Jian, which produced strong liquors with trademarks such as "Ship" and "Globe," which were famous at home and abroad in the early years. In 1906, it even won a special award in Italy. Both factories were founded by Zhang Jian and suffered significant losses during the War of Resistance. Dasheng Third Factory was forcibly occupied by the Japanese for several years. Although it was later returned, many important mechanical parts were looted, and work could not proceed for a time, resulting in a standstill. Although it has now resumed production, all the machines cannot be fully operated. The losses of the Yisheng Factory were even more tragic. The brewing equipment has been lost without a trace, and the factory buildings have been repeatedly damaged by the enemy and puppets, with walls collapsing and birds and animals nesting inside, which is a heartbreaking sight. Opening the factory is even more remote. Therefore, at present, the county's industrial production only consists of the yarn and cloth of Dasheng Third Factory.</p>
<p>Wheat Enters the Market; Soybeans and Sorghum are Harmed by Insects</p>
<p>Haimen has mostly high ground, which is not suitable for growing rice. The main crops are wheat, soybeans, sorghum, and cotton. Residents mostly rely on farming for a living, and they follow old rules for cultivation and fertilization. Fertilizers are mainly human waste and soybean cakes. They refuse to use chemical fertilizers, believing that while the harvest can be increased in the year of application, the land will become infertile as a result.</p>
<p>The main food crop of the residents, wheat, has now entered the market, with a market price of 17,000 to 18,000 yuan per dan. The price of new wheat dried and discounted by 70% or 80% is actually more than 20,000 yuan per dan. The auxiliary food crop is corn sorghum. This year, seedlings of both sorghum and soybeans are harmed by insects, and farmers are helpless and extremely anxious. If the sorghum seedlings are like this, there is no hope for a harvest, and the future of food is worrying.</p>
<p>No Silk is Raised; Mulberry Trees are Cut for Firewood</p>
<p>Raising silkworms was originally a side business for the villagers, but now, because China's silk industry has been in decline, and because fuel is extremely expensive (fuel in Haimen – grass firewood – is in greater demand than supply. Before the war, one dan of rice could be exchanged for 2,000 catties of firewood; after the war, one dan of rice can only be exchanged for 600 catties of firewood), cutting mulberry trees for firewood has resulted in a lack of households raising silkworms. During the slack farming season, 90% of villagers spin yarn and weave cloth to supplement their livelihoods, making it a side business.

<h3>Answering a Mysterious Riddle: Hitler Trapped Himself; The Assassination Attempt Was Hitler's Fatal Wound; Special Translation by the Newspaper's Translation Office</h3>
<p>The question of Hitler's life and death seems to be a mysterious riddle. According to a UPI dispatch from Berlin on the 22nd, Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun did not commit suicide and are still alive. However, according to the article "The Mental Analysis of Hitler" published in the American magazine "Collier's" on May 4, Hitler's absence from the world has become a foregone conclusion. The following is an abridged translation of the article for speculation. The original author of this article, Major Cortez F. Enloe, Jr., is the director of the Medical Group of the US Bombing Strategy Research Institute and has been engaged in researching the impact of bombing on the health of the German people. Co-author Dr. Hans Reese is a professor of neurology at the University of Wisconsin and also an expert at the aforementioned research institute. The two researchers studied captured documents related to Hitler's health and personally questioned Hitler's personal physician, Dr. Giesing. They have detailed analysis and new medical insights into Hitler's health, neurotic anxieties, excessive suspicion, and the degradation of Hitler's mind in his last year.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Personal Physician Obtains Mental Conclusions</h3>
<p>Within this week a year ago, Hitler mysteriously and strangely ended his life, the inevitable fate to which he was destined. That is the conclusion drawn from the notes of Hitler's personal doctors, who once recognized the inner layer of Hitler's body and mind, and witnessed Hitler's self-destruction at the last moment.</p>
<p>The words of doctors know no boundaries. Perhaps because we are doctors, we have been able to obtain sufficient information to prove the physiological and psychological state of Hitler in his last years. When we asked Hitler's personal doctors, they casually and eloquently spoke about their world-famous patient with a doctor-to-doctor attitude. In this way, we obtained the most secret information about the German leader.</p>
<p>Hitler's personal doctors represented a reduced version of the Nazi medical community, from famous scientists to despicable quacks. But the one who dominated Hitler was precisely the latter - a cunning quack. His name was Dr. Morell, and he was Hitler's most trusted confidant and consultant. He was also his health protector.</p>
<p>On the opposite side was the humble Professor Brandt, who was Hitler's personal surgeon and also Germany's most qualified Minister of Health. Between these two extremes was the smug Swiss-German Director of Health, Dr. Conti, who took his own life when he learned that the United Nations was treating him as a war criminal. Fortunately, we had already questioned him for three days before he committed suicide. The other two doctors in Hitler's entourage were relatively unimportant: one was Dr. Giesing, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, and the other was Dr. Gebhardt, the chief surgeon of the Black Guard, who was the last person to see Hitler alive.</p>
<h3>A Page in the History of the Allied Pilot's Difficulties in Haimen</h3>
<p>I remember that at about 4:00 am on June 12, 1945, a silver, giant Allied American aircraft crashed in Sian Village, Songji Port, First District, Haimen County, northern Jiangsu. At that time, the tide was high, and the plane suddenly fell into the great waters of the Yangtze River. Eight people died at the time, and three survived: Lieutenant Leetmond, Sergeant Ketchup, and Sergeant Nashto. The three of them landed on the shore in a rubber boat and sat blankly in a thatched hut by the river. Later, the village chief, Ni Zhenxing, learned of the incident and immediately sent villagers to escort them away from the dangerous area and hide them in the reeds. At about 8:00 am, the Japanese had learned the news and immediately led a large number of puppet soldiers and police to the scene, surrounded it on all sides, first tracked down the whereabouts of the American pilots, and then completely dismantled the objects on the plane. At the time, they also seriously questioned the village chief, but the village chief remained steadfast and did not reveal the truth. The enemy army searched the village for several days, but found no clues. That night, the village chief immediately had someone change the American pilot's clothes and send him to a safe area. Unexpectedly, three days later, a traitor reported to the Japanese army, and the captain of the Japanese garrison immediately arrested the village chief and took him to the Japanese headquarters in San Chang, Haimen, where he was subjected to cruel torture and interrogated severely using various inducements, but he was detained for two weeks for not revealing the truth. After the victory, in December of last year, Mr. Bi Fanyu, an advisor to the US Military Affairs Bureau, led a warship to Songji Port, Haimen, to collect the bodies. The village chief met with him and sent laborers to exhume and transport the buried corpses, taking care of everything and sending them to the US warship before shaking hands and parting. This fact, the course of events, has been previously reported by this newspaper, but it was not described in detail. Now, based on what I know, I am reporting the truth to show the contributions of the people to the War of Resistance and the enthusiasm of the Allied forces.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Private Life: Legends Abound to This Day</h3>
<p>Although Hitler suffered from chronic gastrointestinal illness, often experiencing nausea and severe cramps, his personal physician did not believe he had cancer, as his enemies hoped. His stomach problems were probably due to his peculiar eating habits and excessive medication. Hitler needed to swallow pills, get injections, and adjust his diet at the slightest discomfort. According to his personal surgeon, Dr. Brandt, a continuous stream of vitamin, hormone, glucose, and other supplemental injections was commonplace for Hitler. Whenever Hitler showed signs of a cold, Dr. Morell would give him as many as six injections of cold prevention medication. No wonder Hitler suffered from various weaknesses.</p>
<p>Although various legends about Hitler's private life circulated, there is no reason to believe his sex life was abnormal. Hitler devoted all his energy to fanatical Nazism, having no time to pay attention to women. Although his doctors confirmed he occasionally had relationships with German actresses, his mistress, Eva Braun, was ultimately his ideal companion, able to give him the love and understanding he needed.</p>
<p>Old-School Prussians drove him to alienation and desertion</p>
<p>July 20, 1944, can be said to be the most dangerous period in Hitler's life, and also the most dangerous period for Germany, because Hitler encountered a planned assassination on this day. The masterminds behind this plan were a group of old-school Prussians, who attempted to trigger various psychological reactions in Hitler's mind, causing him to become alienated and deserted, eventually falling into a mental abyss from which he could not escape.</p>
<p>The German Supreme Command Headquarters was located in a birch forest near Rastenburg in East Prussia, and only absolutely reliable Nazi figures could pass through three checkpoints and penetrate the forbidden zone of the headquarters. The assassination plan against Hitler was carried out here. The perpetrator was Colonel Stauffenberg of the German General Staff. He was the liaison officer between the headquarters and the Berlin Army Department. On the morning of July 20, Stauffenberg arrived at the headquarters from Berlin on a special military aircraft, passed through the black-clad guard posts, and went straight to the conference room. One of his briefcases contained documents, and the other contained a bomb. After he placed the second briefcase inside the oak support at one end of the conference table, his mission was accomplished. It was precisely noon at this time. After Stauffenberg left the conference room, Nazi army, navy, and party officials held their routine meeting with Hitler as usual.</p>
<p>Hitler sat in the middle seat on one side of the long table, with his back to the door. Seated around the table were all high-ranking German military and political officials, but Göring, Himmler, and Goebbels were not present. Admiral Voss became the most important figure in this scene. He was sitting right in front of the support of the long table and had to straddle his legs on either side of the support, but he was blocked by the briefcase, so he used his lower limbs to move the briefcase to the other side. According to Hitler's personal physician, Voss's unintentional act saved Hitler's life.</p>
<p>The bomb exploded with a deafening roar at 12:50 p.m. that day. Generals Keitel, Brandt, Bodenschatz, and Berger were killed on the spot. Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, who sat in front of Hitler, and General Freiherr von Freytag-Loringhoven were thrown out of the window and seriously injured. Everyone else present, including Hitler, was injured to varying degrees. The explosive force threw Hitler from his chair straight towards the pillar at the doorway. Just as the roof was collapsing, he dashed out of the door.</p>
<p>Although Hitler suffered serious injuries, they were not permanent. His most serious and lasting wounds were psychological. His eardrums were ruptured, his brain suffered a slight concussion, and his right elbow was severely bruised. He felt dizzy and his hearing was impaired. His right arm was almost immobile, but none of his doctors could find any damage to the joints, muscles, or nerves of his right arm. The doctors concluded that Hitler's inability to move his right arm was a form of hysterical conversion, a physiological reaction caused by unpleasant memories, which gradually eroded his personality. This was a major mental loss for Hitler.</p>
<p>After the Assassination Attempt: The Devil Hitler Foresaw Collapse</p>
<p>Hitler was a man of utmost loyalty, and he accommodated anyone who was loyal to him, regardless of their ability. He considered himself a specially chosen world leader by Heaven. He felt that accepting a disciple was equivalent to bestowing divine grace, and the disciple should express endless gratitude to him. This assassination attempt, which occurred within his inner circle of confidants, could not help but make him feel extremely disheartened. From then on, he dared not fully trust any of his subordinates.</p>
<p>After the assassination attempt, Hitler realized for the first time that his collapse was imminent. At that time, the Soviet army was winning successive victories, pressing towards the German border, while the Allied forces had broken out of the Normandy pocket area, and the Allied air force gradually gained air supremacy over Germany. The bomb had already decided Germany's final fate. Hitler had keen observation skills, and he saw that many of his staff members were risking their lives to eliminate him in order to remove the obstacles to surrender, and he must have believed that Germany was defeated. Although one side of his personality could not accept this conclusion, the other side was controlled by terror and hatred. These uncontrollable emotions eventually led to his suicide.</p>
<p>The most prominent aspect of Hitler's personality was an irresistible true self. Because he felt his status declining, he had to try his best to elevate this true self. It was as if he had two personalities: one that he recognized and one that he needed. He spared no sacrifice to protect the latter – his true self. But the more he tried to elevate this true self, the more he could not resist the pressure of the disillusionment of his ideal.</p>
<p>Refusing to Acknowledge Mistakes: Blaming Others</p>
<p>Hitler had a solipsistic view, believing that he was the only savior of Germany. He was extremely conceited, never admitting his mistakes. This character trait of his was a major threat to his close confidants and subordinates. He often attributed his own failures and mistakes to others.</p>
<p>The diaries of his doctors, Nazi party members he summoned, or any German soldiers never mention Hitler admitting a mistake. In the months leading up to the end of the war, Hitler frequently issued urgent and difficult orders, causing them to often suffer severe reprimands and embarrassing humiliations due to poor handling. Therefore, everyone felt the danger of their positions. If they disagreed with Hitler's opinions based on sound reasoning and spoke frankly to him, they would be denounced as defeatists. Conversely, if they listened and obeyed and fully accepted his views, then they had to work hard to carry them out without any leeway. One Nazi officer once commented that no matter which path you choose, there is a risk of being sentenced to death. Those around Hitler felt trapped in a situation from which it was difficult to escape. In the six months after the assassination attempt, his progressive neurological disorder recurred from time to time. A prominent Nazi figure once said, "Hitler's level of madness is really embarrassing. He often issues urgent orders, only to suddenly revoke them the next day. These orders are both muddled and fragmented, but if someone happens to inquire or ask for an explanation, he flies into a rage."</p>
<p>Gestapo Leader Plotting to Kill Hitler</p>
<p>It is said that Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the German Gestapo, and Hitler's personal physician, Dr. Morell, had a joint conspiracy to chronically poison Hitler. Although there is no conclusive evidence for this, the prescriptions written by Dr. Morell certainly aroused strong suspicion of such intent.</p>
<p>Hitler's other doctor, Dr. Giesing, once out of curiosity, secretly took one of the black pills that Dr. Morell prescribed for Hitler to swallow every day, analyzed it, and found that it contained strychnine and atropine. Regular consumption of these two drugs is very harmful to the nervous system. Morell certainly knew that long-term use of these two drugs would have a narcotic effect.</p>
<p>Due to the narcotic effect of Morell's medications, his deteriorating health, the shock caused by the assassination attempt, and the setbacks in the war, Hitler's spirit gradually collapsed.</p>
<p>The impression obtained from Giesing's last encounter with Hitler clearly illustrates the changes in Hitler's character in the days leading up to his death. In these days, Hitler's conversations were somewhat incoherent and absent-minded. Before one thing was finished, he suddenly shifted to another issue, making it impossible for listeners to grasp his true meaning, thus causing great terror.</p>
<p>The last doctor to serve Hitler was Professor Gebhardt. Gebhardt was the Surgeon General of the Black Guard and the President of the German Red Cross. Gebhardt went to see Hitler at the German Führerbunker at 2:00 a.m. on April 26, forty-eight hours before Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun committed suicide. At that time, Hitler was standing in a small room in the air-raid shelter. Gebhardt told him that Himmler had nominated him to succeed Professor Grawitz as President of the Red Cross, requesting Hitler's approval. Hitler calmly replied, "President of the Red Cross, ah, ah, I am no longer interested in these things. Please do not disturb me." After speaking, he turned around and sat down, as if in deep thought.</p>

<h3>Appeal to "Humanity"</h3>
<p>Editor: Seeing the Nanjing dispatch, the salary adjustment for civil servants (including educators, of course) has not yet been decided, which makes me wonder.</p>
<p>(1) National public educators have reached the last breath. The officials of the Executive Yuan are not unaware of this. In the past few weeks, the newspaper has always reported that the decision will be made next week on this issue. Thus, the millions of public educators who are dying are "拼命" (pin ming, risking their lives) to continue breathing. But one next week, two next weeks, despite going on to next week, I ask, how many next weeks can these millions of dying people wait?</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Li Qing of the Legislative Yuan said; "Those who decide the salaries of civil servants do not need salaries to maintain their lives, and all expenses can be paid by the government. No wonder they obstruct the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants." Who is this referring to? Perhaps there are too many people, and Mr. Li cannot point them out. We have no chance to know them. But Mr. Li's words are "humane", and none of us can deny them. The officials of the Executive Yuan, who are referred to by Mr. Li as those who do not need salaries to maintain their lives and all expenses can be paid by the government and who obstruct the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants, I am afraid they cannot be exonerated.</p>
<p>(3) I really doubt, if the Executive Yuan is indeed the government of China, and the officials of the Executive Yuan are indeed officials of the Chinese government, then these millions of public educators who are dying must not be Chinese. Otherwise, why are they treated with such coldness? Why do they have to endure a "still undecided" even after struggling until today?</p>
<p>I squeeze myself among the millions of public educators who perhaps still consider themselves Chinese, and I suffer the same pain as them. At the same time, I am stimulated by the "humane" words of the Legislative Yuan and moved to say these many words that do not know the importance and disadvantages to make an appeal to "humanity".

<p>The Suffering of Law-Abiding Citizens</p>
<p>Editor: I purchased a house in the former British concession several years ago to live in. After the victory against Japan, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau immediately issued an order stipulating that land registration must be completed between November 18, 1945, and January 18, 1946. Those who applied for registration after the deadline would be fined, or the government would take care of it on their behalf, etc. As a legitimate businessman, I should abide by the law, and it is a necessary procedure. There is no need to wait and see. Therefore, in December of last year, I submitted the ownership deeds, drawings, and documents of the house to the registration office of the Land Administration Bureau for registration and received a temporary receipt. I also asked the clerk in charge when it could be completed. It was said that it would first be measured clearly, then announced in the Municipal Gazette. If there are no objections after two months, I will be notified to collect the official ownership certificate, which would take three months to complete. However, almost half a year has passed since the submission, and the Land Administration Bureau has neither sent anyone to measure nor has the Municipal Gazette made an announcement. Recently, because the expenses in Shanghai are huge, I plan to move back to my hometown and sell the house for travel expenses, so I consulted with real estate agents. They said that the registration procedures have not been completed and cannot be transferred, and the various deeds and documents cannot be handed over. The temporary receipt is not enough to convince people, and there is no way to sell it. Therefore, I had to urge the registration office to issue an official certificate. It was said that after checking the original title deed of the house, the foreign firm that previously managed it had been retrieved and stored in the bureau. According to the drawing attached to the title deed, although it clearly stated how many sections were divided and how much area, and how many houses were built, all the owners of the entire plot of land must completely apply for registration before it can be measured. Because a part of it has not yet been registered, there is no way to handle it. I stated that the original title deed has drawings that clearly indicate the boundaries and area of a certain house, then each house has its own independent basis and can be measured individually. It should not be delayed by the delay of a few people and harm the rights of the majority. If all owners must be present to handle it, what if they never come to register? Will those who have already applied for registration be put on hold forever? The person in charge replied that the bureau has no other way. I think that we who abide by the law and comply with the order to register, the government should provide convenience and expedite the process to encourage us. Why do those who wait and see get freedom, while those who abide by the law are bound and cannot get rid of it? This suffering cannot be expressed. Asking my friends, many of them feel the same way. Please publish this letter in the Reader Opinion column, perhaps the government officials will know to improve.</p>

<p>The Cry of a Small Civil Servant</p>
<p>Editor: I am a small civil servant. My monthly salary is about 70,000 yuan, calculated based on a basic figure of 40,000 yuan and a basic salary of 160 times that. I am grateful to the government for this huge amount of patronage. How can I work hard to repay even a small part of it? However, the rise of prices is increasing day by day. Even gruel soup is hard to come by. I also lack constant property to make up for it, causing my wife and children to cry from hunger. My heart is so worried and indignant that I cannot even speak of my work spirit. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan has passed a method to adjust salaries. I was lucky to be able to catch a breath. How could I know that there are people who say that the number is too large and it may be difficult to implement. This is because these people, in addition to their salaries, may have a way to accumulate wealth, or they may have a way to live on air and not eat human food. They see those who cry from hunger and cold as the actions of ordinary people, and they see themselves as superior animals, completely unmoved? Alas! Full of brains and fat, rich as immortals, the sound of wailing is everywhere, but they do not hear it. They bear heavy responsibilities, how can they not feel guilty towards the gods, and feel ashamed? It is time for conscience to be restored! Honest civil servants are already facing a desperate situation. In addition to quickly giving a reasonable solution, do not delay any longer. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid the discussion of occupying a position without doing anything. Wei Qing Shang.</p>
<h3>The Political Style of the "Liberated Area"</h3>
<p>Editor: After the Japanese surrendered, the occupied areas were gradually recovered. The CCP authorities, disliking that the recovered areas were not revolutionary enough, highly proclaimed the "Liberated Area" and emphasized it. The Germans liberated the Sudetenland and then liberated Czechoslovakia; the Japanese liberated the South Seas and then defined the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; now China is doing the same thing, which is very interesting. Even if it is a liberated area, the object of liberation is the people. The size and name of the original area are not a problem at all. Why change it? The CCP has never stopped adding districts, setting up counties, and changing names from the Anti-Japanese War to the Liberation. The Japanese changed Ryukyu to Okinawa and strongly referred to the Northeast Provinces as Manchuria. Later, they created names such as Eastern Hebei, North China, Central China, and South China, which had an aggressive effect. Now the Liberated Area has names such as Central Jiangsu and Central China. I don't know what it is for. Even if we take a step back and adopt revolutionary means internally, should major events such as changes in administrative regions be adopted by public opinion, follow legal procedures, and be left to the most restored re-handling?</p>
<p>Everything the Liberated Area does seems to have more contradictions and less sincerity. On the one hand, negotiating, on the other hand, attacking; on the one hand, propagating elite (soldiers) and reduced (government), on the other hand, constantly expanding the army; on the one hand, propagating increased production, on the other hand, ignoring the busy farming season, holding public trials in the morning and meetings in the evening, and everywhere persuading people to abandon production and eat ready-made grain; on the one hand, announcing the Three-Thirds System (Kuomintang, Communist Party, and neutral factions each occupy one-third), on the other hand, creating three-capital struggles to squeeze out the remaining two-thirds of the people; on the one hand, fighting for fields for tenant farmers and fighting for wages for hired workers, on the other hand, exploiting farmers and workers in the name of public grain, public grass, tax deeds, and condolence; on the one hand, confiscating counterfeit currency and legal currency, on the other hand, sending people to use it hard or hoarding goods in other places. Summarizing all these things, there is only one goal, which is: to make the rich poor and the poor poorer. When everyone is poor, it is easier for them to join the army and fight for the country, and let the proletariat dictatorship. This style seems to be copied from the Soviet Union, but it has learned it wrong in many places, and there is really no old democracy or new democracy. May I ask, did the people need a break after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War? Are the national conditions of China and Russia the same? Does the CCP have as long a history in the country as the Soviet Russian Revolutionary Party? Does the upper, middle, and lower classes have as many talents as the Soviet Union? Can the current international situation allow a bloody revolution in our country again? Can helping seedlings grow by pulling them up succeed? The CCP does not understand these questions at all and acts recklessly. A blind man on a blind horse is extremely dangerous! As for the most outstanding performances of the CCP at the lower levels, such as: arresting and fining, fining and releasing, releasing and arresting again and fining again; judging and reviewing, reviewing and judging again; calculating old debts, reporting old grudges, 套　包(tao bao- using one pretext to achieve another, drawing in other concerns), 画鸟他 (hua niao ta - a vulgar metaphor for trickery and fraud); and even劃地爲牢 (hua di wei lao - dividing the land into prisons, setting up roadblocks), sometimes not distinguishing between the subject and object, the prosecutor also serves as the executor, so that the people have a naive and pitiful feeling about the very solemn political work. In the past, primary schools once tried the school market, and children carrying schoolbags also learned to be mayors and bureau chiefs. Helping seedlings grow by pulling them up was considered unacceptable by people with insight. Now the politics of the Liberated Area has become child's play, and it is equally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Some people say that revolutions do not have to choose means. This is not necessarily true. Revolutionary actions are related to the interests of the people. Can we not choose means? In the past, the so-called Li Lisan Line was criticized and liquidated, wasn't it? Is it ready to be re-enacted once now and liquidated again in the future?</p>
<p>Some people also say that workers have no motherland. This statement also needs to be examined. How can the number of socialist men and women fighters in countries such as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States be less than that in China? When their country is at war with foreign countries, they would rather give up their usual claims and fight for their country, and they would never engage in internal strife. Not only that, even when they take military revolutionary actions internally, they still maintain the economy, currency, and postal service, and never arbitrarily divide and diverge. During the Soviet revolution, the ruble was still the ruble, and the post office still sent letters as usual. Now the Liberated Area has even liberated the currency and postal service, and even the flag has to borrow from others! I hope that intellectuals who care about national affairs will observe, study, and discuss in many ways to increase the people's understanding, and not捧塲 (peng chang - to give uncritical support). At the same time, I also hope that the CCP will re-examine the current situation and see if it is necessary to change its style? Politics and policies are not immutable. If you have done something wrong in the past, correct it quickly now. If you are in a bad mood and insist on going wrong to the end, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. Both sides will be injured, creating opportunities for neighbors or enemies. Revolutionary parties who take saving the country and the people as their responsibility should not do this! Li Qi, sent from Nantong on May 28.</p>
<h3>How to Relieve the Disaster?</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I read the article in your newspaper on May 30th by a National Assembly representative discussing the Hunan flood disaster, and it filled me with sorrow. "China starves while Shanghai dances," our allies are anxious for us, how can we, fellow countrymen, bear to sit idly by? The American President has ordered Americans to conserve food for the global famine, and the Standing Committee has also ordered the people of Shanghai to conserve food for the Chinese famine. However, these are just empty words, and ordinary people don't know how to conserve. If I eat less each day, my family might save a little, but indirectly and indirectly, how many grains of rice actually reach the disaster victims? I believe the most appropriate and swift way to relieve the disaster is as follows: (1) The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) should provide a large quantity of wheat flour and airdrop it to the affected areas. (If this method can be implemented, then if it is approved in the morning, there will be cooking smoke in the disaster area by noon.) (2) Major restaurants, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment venues in Shanghai should temporarily levy a disaster relief donation, which should be settled and allocated on a daily basis. (3) Large-scale biscuit or bread factories should allocate machines to urgently produce disaster relief biscuits or bread, which should be airdropped. If this method is followed, the authorities, UNRRA, restaurants, bread factories, China National Aviation Corporation, and other entities should cooperate to form a disaster relief committee, working together with one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and the famine can be quickly alleviated.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>The Great Contribution of St. Dunstan's: New Life for the Blind</h3>
<p>St. Dunstan's Home for the Blind has helped blind people regain their self-esteem and confidence, making them feel that they have once again become useful members of society.</p>
<p>When the famous English poet Milton went blind, he comforted himself by saying, "Those who are blind will also serve all of mankind." However, in the past, only a few great figures could satisfactorily engage in thinking or literary work after going blind. For ordinary people, blindness was the end of all their activities, and their lives became parasitic.</p>
<p>During World War I, Sir Arthur Pearson, a prominent figure in England, went blind. He was enthusiastic and active, and he was unwilling to sit still and wait for death. He also thought of other people who had been blinded by the war, and he decided to change the fate of those who had been blinded in combat. Therefore, with the help of friends, he established a training center called St. Dunstan's, which housed blind soldiers and women.</p>
<p>After living in the famous St. Dunstan's training center for one or two years and learning independent skills in work and play, one would feel that a wonderful and fulfilling life was unfolding before them.</p>
<p>Blind people can learn to read from Braille books or listen to specially prepared gramophone recordings of books. They also learn typing, walking independently, and enjoying normal pastimes, such as swimming, horseback riding, singing, and music. They can also play specially printed cards, and they can ride on the back of bicycles. Blind women learn household skills. At St. Dunstan's, there are special instructors, including blind instructors, who know how to teach blind people the skills necessary for these activities. It takes nine months to learn to read using the Braille system.</p>
<p>The work that blind people learn is becoming more and more varied each year. St. Dunstan's often trains basket weavers, but now blind people are often trained to be telephone operators, masseuses, shop assistants, poultry farmers, stenographers, and mechanics. Blind people will increasingly take on industrial jobs, which means they will be able to participate in normal life. What blind people need most is to be able to support themselves. Economic self-reliance restores self-esteem and confidence, because they feel they are once again useful members of society.</p>
<p>Of the men and women who were blinded in World War I, about three thousand have been able to become economically independent. Of those blinded in World War II, about one thousand have come to St. Dunstan's for education so far. Not only British soldiers, but also soldiers from allied countries, are cared for by St. Dunstan's. When each blind soldier leaves the home, the home presents them with a wireless radio receiver and a talking watch.</p>
<p>When blind men and women leave the home, although they have the ability to lead active lives, they can still encounter difficulties. Therefore, the home has a special organization to assist them when they need help. Whether it is work difficulties, family difficulties, economic difficulties, or poor health, the home's welfare or technical visitors are always available to provide guidance and practical assistance.</p>
<p>All those who have been trained by the home wear a medal—the Torch of Life—once a blind person has been trained by the home, they can discover a new and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>If the British people had not provided financial assistance, Sir Arthur Pearson would not have been able to make St. Dunstan's so useful. All training, treatment, and aftercare work at St. Dunstan's is funded by voluntary donations. The British people understand the many obligations they have to those who were blinded while serving the country in the World War. In the last fiscal year, the home's total donations were around 630,000 pounds. People admitted for treatment do not pay fees. Therefore, the subsidies given by the British government can still be maintained.</p>
<p>So how does St. Dunstan's give new life to the blind? There are three stages: hospital treatment, general independent training, and special vocational training.</p>
<p>During World War II, the home received financial assistance from the government and took over a hospital specifically for treating blind people, always trying to restore some sight if possible. The home has its own seaside sanatorium, where blind people can restore their physical health and vitality, because there are comfortable and convenient environments there.</p>

<p>But Gebhardt then said, "Another mission I have here is to help these children and women. I have already prepared a Red Cross car, perhaps the last vehicle to leave Berlin. Could I ask the Fuhrer to order who should leave?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, we don't need help, they are willing to stay here, but you might as well ask them again," Hitler replied, without changing his lost expression.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lit, and everyone was sitting in a disorganized manner, as if waiting for a great disaster to befall them. Gebhardt turned around and asked the others, but no one seemed to care. Finally, Hitler announced to everyone, "Dr. Gebhardt is going to Berlin, this is your last chance. Who wants to go?" There was still no answer. Only one woman shook her head. Then Hitler looked back at Gebhardt and said in a weary and monotonous tone, "You see, no one wants to go with you."</p>
<h3>Explosive Behavior Creates a Destined Demise</h3>
<p>Gebhardt's account allows us to clearly see the decline of the spirit that once ruled Germany. It was the spirit of a megalomaniac and sadist. When it accepted the call of the god of death, this spirit finally found rest. Hitler's spirit was not a pathological one. Half of his innate desires were satisfied in his ideology, and half were satisfied by his mistresses. From the behavior of Hitler as described by German psychiatrists and other doctors who observed Hitler for many years, one cannot find any elements of madness.</p>
<p>Hitler reached the highest point of neurosis in his final stages. A psychotic patient or a madman exhibits hallucinations and other qualitative changes in thought, but a neurotic patient exhibits only an excessive expression of normal emotions, that is, a quantitative change.</p>
<p>The ending of Hitler's life was the inevitable result of his explosive behavior. Early success nurtured his arrogant and self-important character, and gradually erased reason and judgment. The endless pursuit of expanding power and the internal struggle with reason and judgment completely burned his spirit in the flames of his own life. Thus, the German dictator destroyed himself.</p>
<p>A life like Hitler's had no other ending than suicide and assassination. As his doctor said, self-destruction was the only goal of Hitler's spiritual development. This was his only way to escape an inevitable fate.</p>
<p>The strike against Hitler's life by Stauffenberg and those involved in the assassination received unexpected gains. Hitler's confidant doctors and psychiatrists believed that this event was a major factor in contributing to Hitler's spiritual bankruptcy and accelerating the collapse of Germany and the death of the German leader. Hitler was trapped by his own devices and ultimately sacrificed himself. He lived arrogantly and died a bad death; it can be said that he received the reward he deserved.</p>

<h3>Gold Bars</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Paying rent with gold bars seems to have become an established fact in this day and age. Ma Xingye, the president of the Nanjing Central Daily News, wrote an article titled "Two Examples, One Appeal" because the landlord was oppressing him and his chief writer, filled with indignation. At the end, he said:</p>
<p>Unreasonable is unreasonable, no lawyer, no court, no newspaper, no mouth can turn unreasonable into reasonable!</p>
<p>We need courage in the face of unreasonable things!</p>
<p>We want to declare war on greedy, blood-sucking, evil landlords!</p>
<p>Naturally, this is the view of a scholar. What effect does "declaring war" on them have?</p>
<p>"A New Account of the Tales of the World" records the following story:</p>
<p>"Guan Ning and Hua Xin were weeding vegetables in the garden together when they saw a piece of gold on the ground. Guan continued to weed as if it were no different from tiles and stones, while Hua picked it up and threw it away."</p>
<p>There was no so-called housing shortage at the time; otherwise, Mr. Guan and Mr. Hua would have picked it up long ago and used it as a tribute to the landlord.</p>
<h3>Apprentices Also Need to Read</h3>
<p>— Chen Mianyu</p>
<p>Of course, I must state that this is not about carrying a schoolbag and entering the school gate to study; but simply saying that in one's spare time, one can take advantage of available free time to choose beneficial books that suit one's needs and preferences to study on one's own, adapting to the realities of the environment.</p>
<p>Because in the vast group of apprentices, there are also many young people who are determined to make progress. They have to work as apprentices for a living, but they have not forgotten their pursuit of education. In fact, apprentices do not have the convenient opportunity to enter school to study; so they embark on this path of self-study through reading.</p>
<p>In terms of motivation and goals, this is of course undeniable and is a legitimate act. But I don't understand why a considerable number of shopkeepers and managers not only discriminate against this, but also absolutely prohibit apprentices from reading. Is it because reading is useful? This is not worth laughing at.</p>
<p>I only realized some things recently after hearing the stories of several friends who had been through this. The biggest reason, or rather, the comprehensive excuse, is that they believe that reading will interfere with their inherent work and affect their own interests.</p>
<p>In fact, this is fundamentally wrong. For example, in the afternoon at a counter shop, when there is nothing to do, why can't the studious apprentices read some books? If they don't leave their posts and don't leave the shop door, how will they neglect their duties? Perhaps some people are overly sensitive and think that if they drop the book halfway, the receptionist will neglect to attend to customers who happen to come. In fact, the apprentices themselves will never do this intentionally. Since they are rational about their efforts in their spare time, they naturally understand their environment. Having the right to read, they will only be grateful, and therefore work even harder, which is a natural emotion.</p>
<p>From another perspective, it has considerable benefits for the shopkeeper: first, apprentices who read books also have a mental adjustment (which can also be called recreation), they will not turn to other bad recreational habits, and naturally there is a normal guarantee for their work; and the bad consequences caused by bad recreational habits, embezzlement, and private gain will not harm the shop.</p>
<p>Second, reading more can increase knowledge and wisdom, and because of the increase in wisdom, apprentices have more skills and insights in serving customers, which naturally makes customers feel satisfied and promotes business development.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to loudly shout that apprentices also need to continue reading!</p>
<h3>National Flag</h3>
<p>— Yu Ti</p>
<p>At present, the national flags hung in Shanghai can be said to be unified in terms of size, flagpole length, and the angle of the iron frame; but these are material unities. In terms of spirit, however, they are scattered and not unified. Such as the following:</p>
<p>(1) Inconsistent times for raising and lowering the flag—When raising the flag in the morning, some do so around 6:00 AM, some around 8:00 AM, and still others don't even know if it's a day when the national flag should be flown, so they don't hang it until the police officers inform them. As for lowering the flag, the times are even more inconsistent. I have seen several places where the flag has not been lowered even after 9:00 PM. Even more absurdly, some even forget to lower the flag, letting it fly in the darkness. Whenever it suddenly rains, the flag should be taken down and not allowed to be soaked in the rain. This point should also be noted.</p>
<p>(2) Inconsistency between full flag and half-mast—On commemorative days for celebration, a full flag should be flown, and on commemorative days for mourning, a half-mast should be flown. There is no need for me to say more about this. However, there are many times when a half-mast should be flown, but a full flag is flown instead. For example, on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, a half-mast should be flown, but in many places, a full flag is flown instead. Furthermore, on March 29th, some say that it is the Youth Day celebration, so a full flag should be flown; others say that it is the Huanghuagang Memorial Day, so a half-mast should be flown. In fact, the national flag should not be flown on Youth Day; a half-mast should be flown.</p>
<p>(3) Common sense regarding raising a flag to half-mast—When raising to half-mast, the national flag should first be raised to the top, and then lowered to one foot from the top. It should never be raised to one foot from the top and then stopped. When flying the flag at half-mast, one should pay attention to whether the distance between the flag and the top of the pole meets the regulations.</p>
<p>I think all Chinese people should pay attention to the above points of common sense.</p>
<h3>How Should Zhou Zuoren Be Punished?</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>As the traitor Chen Gongbo said, "Who would dare to say that I am innocent now?" In fact, being guilty, of course, no one says is "innocent," daring or not daring is another issue.</p>
<p>According to news reports, the cultural traitor Zhou Zuoren has recently been escorted to Beijing, and the date of his public trial is probably not far off. It is indeed a pity that Elder Zhitang has fallen into the water and cannot preserve his integrity in his later years. Since the May Fourth Movement, Zhou has always been an important figure in the Chinese literary world, and he has indeed made many contributions to the establishment of the new culture. Even after falling into the water, he is still a relatively large maggot in the cesspool. Even the writers who currently defame him as a "stinky literati" are probably somewhat influenced by his writing. Therefore, in addition to feeling sorry for Zhou himself, I also feel sorry for Chinese culture. There are very few people like him who are well-versed in academic research, and too few people who are well-versed in academic research have left a stain on Chinese culture. How can one not feel sorry for Chinese culture?</p>
<p>This is not to defend Zhou Zuoren and say that he is innocent. He once served as the puppet North China Education Supervisor and a specially appointed official of the puppet National Government. Even a three-year-old child would think he is a traitor. Although he is a traitor, after investigating his crimes, I would like to suggest to the authorities: there is no need to impose the death penalty, but instead replace it with life imprisonment, ordering him to translate the entire history of Greek literature to redeem himself.</p>
<p>This is a book that Zhou had long planned to write but had not started. Zhou's research on Greek literature is indeed profound and beyond the reach of his peers. If he translates it in its entirety, there will definitely be many wonderful parts. It will also be a small contribution to the weak translation community in China.</p>
<p>Sunzi lost his feet and passed down the art of war, and Sima Qian was castrated and wrote the Records of the Grand Historian. If the death penalty is only for the purpose of isolating society, then if Zhou can be sentenced to life imprisonment, with no unscrupulous disciples surrounding him in prison, he can complete his initial wish of translation.</p>

<h3>Wang Xiaolai Says Everyone is at the "Myriad Barrier"</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The worker index for May has already been announced as more than 4,090 times the pre-war level. At a certain banquet, Wang Xiaolai commented on this issue, saying: "Today, the price of goods compared to the value of money has reached the 'myriad barrier,' that is, 10,000 yuan today is almost equal to one yuan before the war." In Ningbo dialect, it is customary to say that when things reach an unbearable point, it is "myriad barrier," so today it is truly what is called the "myriad barrier"! (Myriad Barrier, Myriad Barrier, a pun, Elder Xiao is a wonderful person, and often has wonderful words.)</p>
<p>Sun Ke gave a speech at a dinner party of the American Alumni Association yesterday. When talking about land taxation, he said that if a piece of land or a building is sold in Shanghai, the government must levy a tax of 40%, according to the Land Law. There is no clear provision in the Land Law, which is actually contradictory. However, he believed that Shanghai had done this first, and it had not yet been approved by the Legislative Yuan. He then said to Mayor Wu, who was sitting next to him, with a humorous tone and a smile: "In the future, I hope that those who set taxes will read the Land Law carefully, so as to avoid similar situations from happening again." At that time, Mayor Wu nodded repeatedly in agreement, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, the Mayor held a cocktail party at the "Skyscraper," with ladies as numerous as clouds, a magnificent occasion. The international elevator specially opened a "special number" to transport guests, but because there were so many people coming continuously, the queue for the elevator almost reached Park Road. Although not unprecedented, it was unprecedented in scale. According to news from Father Jacques, a total of 600 invitations were sent out for this event, but the reporters at the scene estimated that there were at least 900 guests. When asked, the elevator operators also considered this number to be quite accurate.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching guests at the cocktail party were Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife. Mrs. Chiang is the daughter of Shi Fengxiang, a major industrialist in Northwest China. That day, Mrs. Chiang wore full summer attire, a black and white checkered "sand-tuxedo" cheongsam, and the latest style of glass leather shoes and glass stockings, which was appreciated by the general female guests. Mrs. Chiang also wore a pair of earrings, with red agate inlaid in the middle and diamonds around the outer edge, which was quite delicate. Diamond light competed with the color of glass, all combined into one, adding a lot of color to the cocktail party that day.</p>
<p>After the banquet ended, the reporters talked about the glass leather shoes, confirming that Mrs. Chiang Wei-kuo's glass shoes were the first pair in Shanghai. However, according to well-informed sources, "good news" has been spread: recently, a certain import company has obtained dozens of new pairs of goods to Shanghai, but the "beautiful ladies are afraid that if they are put on sale publicly, there will inevitably be more monks than porridge, so some people have already been inquiring around, preparing to buy them up" to avoid falling behind and missing the fashion.</p>
<h3>The Song of the Filial Daughter-in-Law (The Busy Mother)</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>『One busy thing,</p>
<p>Get up early in the morning to open the window, bright and bright;</p>
<p>Two busy things,</p>
<p>With disheveled hair and dirty face, rush into the kitchen;</p>
<p>Three busy things,</p>
<p>Urge the midday meal as if chasing famine;</p>
<p>Four busy things,</p>
<p>Tidy up, fetch water, wash clothes;</p>
<p>Five busy things,</p>
<p>When school is over, ask about everything in detail;</p>
<p>Six busy things,</p>
<p>Light up the lamp and cut clothes;</p>
<p>Seven busy things,</p>
<p>The child yawns, quickly fold the quilt and spread the bed;</p>
<p>Eight busy things,</p>
<p>In the quiet of the night, sew two more rows on the soles of the shoes;</p>
<p>Nine busy things,</p>
<p>When idle, take him for a walk;</p>
<p>Ten busy things,</p>
<p>Say to take him to marry a wife and children, instead throwing me, his own mother.』</p>
<p>This is a ballad describing the busyness of being a mother. This ballad fully expresses the hard work of a mother managing the household and caring for her children. Therefore, how to support one's mother? How to repay the great kindness of a mother's upbringing? This is something that those who are sons should pay attention to and practice. Otherwise, if one only cares for one's wife and neglects the filial duty to one's mother, no matter what, one has a guilty conscience.</p>
<h3>Ideal Occupational Life</h3>
<p>— Wu Zongwen</p>
<p>Human instinct is to satisfy the desire for survival. To satisfy this desire from an economic perspective and the organization of society, everyone must have the capacity to produce and engage in work.</p>
<p>Because in this collective society where people live, one cannot obtain without labor or sit idle and eat; one needs a profession to exert one's ability to the fullest, and then one can take what one needs. This directly allows each person to obtain suitable work to do, satisfying their own desire for survival, and indirectly promotes human culture, increases productive forces, and prospers the social economy, which has a significant impact on the nation and its people.</p>
<p>Occupation and life are closely related. Occupation is a tool for human survival, and there is no distinction between high and low, noble and base; everyone should have one. Occupation is eternal; on one hand, it is for one's own livelihood—self-interest; on the other hand, it is for serving the public—altruism. Based on this belief, everyone engaged in an occupation should adhere to the purpose of living to serve, strengthen work efficiency, and strive to increase production to have meaning and generate interest.</p>
<p>Interest is something that can encourage people to progress, improve their new understanding of things, and cultivate research spirit and a scientific mind. Many successful people in the world, such as great scientists, great inventors, and great entrepreneurs, have succeeded because they have a strong interest in their careers, are not afraid of failure, and continue to research, experiment, and create, achieving success and fulfilling their ideal occupational life that benefits both themselves and others.</p>
<p>However, the current social phenomenon is too disappointing for those of us engaged in occupations. Everyone cannot even obtain the minimum needs for life, wandering and struggling on the starvation line every day. Everyone feels threatened and extremely unstable in their lives, so what interest can they have in their occupations? How is this unreasonable phenomenon created? Who is preventing us from achieving a more reasonable occupational life? This is something everyone engaged in an occupation should study, explain, and strive to fight for.</p>
<p>Our country, after this arduous eight-year war of resistance, has finally achieved unprecedented victory, embarked on the broad road of democracy, unity, and peace, and begun to create a victorious life. In the future process of national construction, there are many arduous tasks that require people in all sectors engaged in occupations to do. As long as we can muster interest, take responsibility, enrich our knowledge, cultivate our skills, and each work hard in our respective positions, doing what we should do, and contribute all our strength, we firmly believe that it is not difficult to obtain a more ideal occupational life.</p>
<h3>Refrigerator · Sofa</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xin</p>
<p>The new-style refrigerator has doors that can be opened and closed on either the left or right, with hinges on both sides, making it very convenient to use.</p>
<p>The armrests of the sofa are changed into small boxes with holes, which can hold needlework bags, pipes, slippers, and magazines, making housewives and gentlemen feel more convenient and comfortable.</p>
<p>On the newly painted corridor floor, it is usually covered with wooden boards. If a few triangular wooden plugs are nailed under the boards, the contact surface can be reduced to the minimum.</p>
<h3>Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The famous painter Liu Shi, who has been absent from the Shanghai art scene for eight years, has abandoned oil paints and easels in a wandering life, turning to brush and rice paper to paint fish, exerting his consistent creative power.</p>
<p>Liu Shi is the nephew of Mr. Hai Su, a giant in the art world. He has solid shaping techniques and extraordinary expressiveness in art. Due to his innate artistic talent, his expressiveness has developed in many directions. Before the war, he mainly worked with oil paintings, and also dabbled in sculpture and some applied arts. Recently, he returned to Shanghai and indeed embarked on the path of brush painting, so-called traditional Chinese painting. His ability to develop in multiple directions proves that he has abundant talent. It can also be said that he is using different materials to experiment with various expressive effects, rather than catering to the low-level preferences of the general public to create traditional Chinese paintings. Therefore, it can also be said that Liu Shi is an excellent artist who has passed through all departments of the entire shaping art.</p>
<p>Speaking of Liu Shi's artistic style, before the War of Resistance, it was mainly oil paintings. In terms of figures, he had a solid and elegant neo-classical tendency. Landscapes and still lifes tended more towards the tastes of the Fauvist group, especially in the grasp of lines, which are firm, smooth, and meticulous, combined with bright, strong, and calm colors to create a unique picture, making each picture seem to emit a harmonious musical note, expressing the writer's supreme wisdom.</p>
<p>Because Liu Shi has solid shaping techniques and uses materials such as clay and plaster, he produces many sculptural works, and these works are by no means superficially similar, but have an intrinsic qualitative expression, and have a common tendency of modern art. It seems that we can only compare him with Maillot and Bourdelle.</p>
<p>After he went to the mainland in the early days of the War of Resistance, feeling the scarcity of foreign materials, he used inherent brushes and rice paper to paint, and what he painted were indeed aquatic creatures such as goldfish, carp, shrimp, and crabs, as well as lions, tigers, and a few figure paintings. He applied his skilled shaping techniques to the so-called traditional Chinese painting methods that have always advocated subjective expression. These works are very realistic in terms of descriptive techniques, but the brushstrokes, composition, momentum, etc. unique to Chinese brush painting are still completely preserved. It can be said that this is a new discovery in Chinese art, at least in technology, and it is worthy of our attention.</p>

<h3>Farewell to Sichuan on Returning to the Capital after Victory</h3>
<p>— Zou Lu</p>
<p>Returning to the capital after victory, the boat heads east (May 28, 1946). The citizens line the banks to see Slope Gong. Ashamed of lacking the great virtue to stay in Western Shu, I rely on united hearts to play a great success. Ten years (I arrived in Chongqing on December 1, 1937, and leave today) of living here made me forget being a guest, and the thousands of hardships I endured made me wonder if I had become an old man. The mountains and rivers are like relatives and friends everywhere, so let's not talk about Yun Fei singing a big wind.</p>
<p>Brief Collection of Remarks</p>
<h3>Robbers Love Perfume</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Recently, when playing card games, people often concentrate and become extremely tense at the last card. Therefore, I suddenly realized that in international negotiations, at the final important juncture, news often uses the phrase "let's see the last card," and the use of this adjective is appropriate. There is nothing better than this, using the small to explain the big, and only those who love gambling can best understand the wonderful thing about this.</p>
<p>On the 31st of last month, two robbery cases occurred in this city, with inexplicable aspects: (1) A young man on Nanjing West Road was robbed of a wallet containing over a thousand yuan in legal tender, chased relentlessly, and was shot, almost losing his life. This young man's courageous spirit is admirable, but to say that he risked danger simply because he couldn't bear to part with a thousand yuan (currently, a thousand yuan is only enough to buy a pack of cigarettes) seems unnecessary. (2) The Ma family on Avenue Joffre was robbed, and in addition to losing 100,000 yuan in legal tender and gold pounds, there was also a bottle of perfume. Isn't it strange that robbers also love perfume?</p>
<p>A fair and reasonable suggestion: The eighteen-story Broadway Mansion has at least two or three hundred rooms. Why must it be sold? Amidst the serious housing shortage, why not rent it out publicly, wouldn't that be convenient for both parties?</p>
<p>After Yin County announced that Li Xianzhao was elected as a member of the South Suburb Township Council, at the same time, the High Court Branch announced the fourth list of wanted traitors, and Li Xianzhao was also on the list. After Li saw the report, he took his leave amidst the congratulations of guests. I am very fortunate that the elected council members in Shanghai are all clean.</p>
<p>Han Langen was deemed a collaborator in the film industry and was opposed to participating in the "House of Loyalty" performance. Then, for the many collaborators in various industries who are currently on trial, it is enough to simply prohibit them from re-entering their respective industries. Why must they be arrested?</p>

<h3>The Political Situation and Human Sentiment at the End of the Han Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajie</p>
<p>The emperors of the late Eastern Han Dynasty were mostly short-lived. Those who succeeded to the throne were generally young and knew nothing, which naturally led to the empress dowager listening to politics, the maternal relatives monopolizing power, and the eunuchs gaining influence. The struggle between women, eunuchs, and maternal relatives evolved into the history of the Eastern Han Dynasty's demise. From the time Emperor He joined forces with the eunuch Zheng Zhong to kill the powerful maternal relative Dou Xian and his brothers, until Yuan Shao led troops into the palace during the reign of Emperor Xian, these ninety years were entirely the world of eunuchs. Although there were maternal relatives like Liang Ji and Dou Wu who wanted to seize power from the eunuchs, they ended up losing their lives and achieving nothing. The power of the eunuchs grew stronger day by day. Those in the court were granted titles and controlled the government. Their relatives and brothers spread throughout the prefectures and counties, extorting from the people, harming the commoners, seizing women, and killing the good. They truly caused the people to live in misery, and Heaven and people were filled with resentment. There are many records in the historical books about their various evils. When we read them, we can only feel anger and sigh. Let's look at the biography of Shan Chao in the *Book of the Later Han*:</p>
<p>"Shan Chao, Xu Huang, Ju Yuan, Zuo Guan, and Tang Heng were all enfeoffed as marquises on the same day, and the world called them the Five Marquises. They all competed to build mansions, with magnificent buildings and extreme craftsmanship. Gold and silver were used on dogs and horses. They took many good men and beautiful women as wives and concubines. All were adorned with precious and extravagant items, imitating the palace people. Their brothers and relatives all governed prefectures and counties, exploiting the people, no different from bandits."</p>
<p>These eunuchs were all meritorious officials who eliminated the maternal relatives during the reign of Emperor Huan. Once they gained favor and seized power, they did all kinds of evil and acted as they pleased. Let's look again at what is written in the *Book of the Later Han* about Hou Lan: "He indulged in extravagance and forcibly seized property. He seized 381 houses, 118 *qing* of land, and built 16 mansions, all with high buildings, ponds, and gardens, with halls and pavilions facing each other, decorated with brocade books and vermilion lacquer, with deep and elaborate systems,僭類宮省·破人居室，發掘墳墓. He captured good people and plundered wives and children." Such ferocity, lewdness, and extravagance were completely bandit-like behavior. When it came to Emperor Ling, he was even more shameless. He called the eunuch Zhang Rang "father" and the eunuch Zhao Zhong "mother." He did no proper business, drove a four-donkey cart outside the city, and sometimes played with dogs in the Western Garden, drinking and feasting for pleasure. He also had palace women open small shops in the harem, selling groceries. He even set prices for selling official titles. A two-thousand-dan official cost 20 million cash, a four-hundred-dan official cost 4 million, a duke cost 10 million, and a minister cost 5 million. The emperor accumulated the money and stored it all in the eunuchs' homes. Such an emperor combined with such eunuchs naturally produced all kinds of chaos and evil in politics. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for a few upright gentlemen to eliminate this evil force. The result was that soldiers led troops into the palace and killed them all.</p>
<p>Since the Western Han Dynasty implemented the private land ownership system, wealthy nobles bought land and concentrated wealth, and the livelihood of the common people became increasingly impoverished. Although Wang Mang once nationalized the land and restricted capital, his policies completely failed. By the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the power of the noble wealthy had become even more inflated. They had vast fields, magnificent strongholds, and estates, thousands upon thousands of slaves,養無數的勇士刺客, augmenting their evil power. They could resist the court's orders above and exploit the weak commoners and plunder women below. The common people, under such circumstances, could only endure indescribable suffering. Zhongchang Tong said in his "Treatise on Governance and Chaos":</p>
<p>"The houses of the wealthy are connected by hundreds of beams, the fields are full of fields, the slaves number in the thousands, and the followers number in the tens of thousands. Ships and carts trade in all directions. The waste houses and stores are full of all the capital regions. The strange gifts and solid goods, giant chambers can not contain, horses and cattle, mountains and valleys can not receive.妖童美委，填乎綺室，倡謳妓樂，列乎深堂. Important guests wait to be seen but dare not leave, carriages and horses crisscross but dare not proceed. The meat of three sacrificial animals is rotten and inedible, and the pure wine is spoiled and drinkable."</p>
<p>With money and power, who wouldn't envy such a life of enjoyment? Even scholars all strove towards this path. Some used fraud, some used persuasion, some flattered the eunuchs, and some colluded with the powerful clans, disregarding their reputation and abandoning shame, only wanting to achieve their selfish goals. "If someone is cunning and deceitful, then they will obtain it. If someone can obtain it, then people will not consider it a crime. The source has sprouted and become chaotic, and the roads have opened and lead in all directions. Who would be willing for a scholar to abandon glory and accept poverty and hardship, to abandon ease and rush to restraint?" Zhongchang Tong's words are truly the most poignant and realistic. However, the good scholars and common people, seeing such dark and corrupt eunuch politics and suffering economic oppression from the noble rich, could not be without revulsion. People with more advanced ideas and passionate emotions naturally expressed words and actions of dissatisfaction. Thus, famous student movements and peasant uprisings occurred one after another.</p>
<p>Student movements belonged to the intellectual class, and peasant uprisings belonged to the primary production class. Although detailed historical materials about their various activities were destroyed by orthodox historians, we can still see from the fragmented records that their purpose and activities were not the behavior of rebellious ministers and thieves. At that time, the student movement was mainly composed of more than 30,000 university students. Under that chaotic and dark state, they could no longer tolerate it. Thus, they launched powerful attacks on those foxes and dogs of corrupt officials and warmly supported upright people, creating strong public opinion. This public opinion was not without power. Even the eunuchs and maternal relatives could not turn a deaf ear to it. Therefore, both inside and outside the court, they competed to praise and criticize each other, and from the dukes and ministers down, all feared their criticism and eagerly visited their doors. At that time, they supported Li Ying, Chen Fan, and Wang Chang, who had ideas and courage. Although these three people had different official ranks, they shared the same idea of ​​punishing eunuchs, killing local tyrants, and eliminating harm for the people. Because the university students supported them, they shouted slogans: "Li Yuanli is the model of the world; Chen Zhongju does not fear the powerful. We will support the outstanding talents of the world who do not fear the powerful, otherwise, we will repel them." In this way, eunuchs and corrupt officials had to unite to deal with them. The charge was easy to make. "Li Ying and others are raising wandering scholars from the Imperial Academy, forming relationships with students from various prefectures, slandering the imperial court,怀疑风乱俗.” That was enough. Thus, Emperor Ling issued an order to arrest the partisans, arresting more than two hundred at a time. Those who escaped were hunted down with rewards. This kind of bandit behavior could not suppress the youth's resentment, but only stimulated his enthusiasm. Fan Pang said to the interrogating officer, "In ancient times, those who cultivated goodness sought more blessings for themselves. Now, those who cultivate goodness are in great difficulty. On the day of my death, I wish to be buried on the side of Shouyang Mountain." (*Book of the Later Han, Biography of Fan Pang*) Although Li Ying and Fan Pang were arrested and imprisoned, the student movement's group did not disperse, and the power of public opinion did not diminish. On the contrary, it became stronger and more intense. More people joined, and the momentum became even greater. When the eunuchs saw this situation, they realized that they had to carry out a major massacre to suppress this movement. At that time, Emperor Ling was only fourteen years old, innocent and lively, and didn't understand much. He asked the eunuch Cao Jie, "You are clamoring to kill the partisans every day. What do the partisans have to do with you?" Cao Jie was too insidious and knew that he had to use a threatening word. He said that the partisans wanted to overthrow you and become emperors themselves. So the fourteen-year-old emperor was also angered. This action was large-scale. It was not enough to kill eight or nine hundred partisans. All those who were upright, had some ideas, and had some knowledge were implicated, and their wives and children were exiled to the borders. When Fan Pang was being executed, he said to his son, "I want you to do evil things, but evil things cannot be done. I want you to do good things, and I am doing good things, but the result is like this." How resentful and how heavy these words were. No wonder the people on the roadside shed tears when they heard them.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the eunuchs were triumphant, and the student movement failed. A small number of outstanding elements in the intellectual class at that time all died under the swords of the eunuchs. Culture and thought suffered a major loss, and freedom of speech was completely deprived. The remnants of the intellectual world had to hide in the deep mountains or practice Taoism in caves. After Sima Guang finished compiling this history, he said with emotion: "When the world is in order, gentlemen serve in the court, punish the crimes of petty people, and no one dares to disobey. When the world is in disorder, gentlemen remain silent. Because of the calamity of petty people, they still cannot avoid it. In the chaotic world of the partisans, they were not in their positions. The West Sea was横　流, and they wanted to以口舌　之. To assess people, to激濁揚清.撩　蛇之頭，踐虎狼之尾, resulting in personal humiliation,祸及朋友,士类歼灭, and the country followed with ruin. Is it not sad?" On the one hand, he mourned the pitiful deaths of the scholars, and on the other hand, he seemed to blame these people for commenting on the current political situation and suffering extermination because they were not in their positions. We believe that his opinion is wrong. The partisans cannot be held responsible for the country's demise. I think this student movement was a manifestation of the great spirit of Chinese scholars, a manifestation of the great spirit of fighting for freedom, fighting for justice, and fighting for survival.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the situation of the peasant uprisings. Peasants had no knowledge or ideas, and their minds were simple. Their lives were朴質. Their only hope was that the world would be peaceful so that they could cultivate the land and seek food and clothing safely, regardless of whether the eunuchs or the maternal relatives were in power. If officials and rich people oppressed them too much, making it impossible for them to live or die, they would also revolt. The peasants of the late Han Dynasty lived painfully under the hardships of continuous natural disasters, coupled with the devaluation of currency, high prices, and the exploitation of wealthy nobles and officials. As a result, they fled, starved, killed each other, and even ate each other, eventually dying.</p>
<p>"In the third year of Yongchu during the reign of Emperor An, there was a severe famine in Bing and Liang provinces, and people ate each other." *Book of the Later Han*, the third year of Jianning during the reign of Emperor Ling, a woman in Henan ate her husband, and the husband ate his wife." (Ibid.)</p>
<p>"In the first year of Yongle during the reign of Emperor Huan, 32 prefectures and kingdoms suffered from locusts. The Yellow River overflowed, and the people were cold and disorderly. There were hundreds of thousands of households displaced on the roads, especially in Ji Province." (Ibid.)</p>
<p>"When Cao Cao arrived, he buried tens of thousands of men and women alive in the Si River, and the water stopped flowing. He attacked and captured the counties of Xiaqiu, slaughtering all of them, even the chickens and dogs. The ruined villages had no more travelers." (*Annotation to the Biography of Xun Yu in the Book of Wei*)</p>
<p>Cao Cao fought against Yuan Shao at Guandu, "斩首七万余级." (*Annotation to the Emperor Wu Ji in the Book of Wei*)</p>
<p>With natural disasters of floods and droughts, coupled with major massacres and hunger, what way out was there for the common people? Therefore, peasants across the country revolted. During the reign of Emperor Huan, there was Li Jian, who claimed to be emperor, Gongsun Ju, who attacked and killed Hou Zhang, and Shusun Wuji, who was the leader of revolts in Changsha, Lingling, Wuling, and Ai counties. Peasant revolts were almost everywhere. When one revolt was suppressed, another rose up like spring grass after rain. By the time of Emperor Ling, the small organizations in various places formed a large alliance, which was the most famous Yellow Turban Rebellion in history.</p>
<p>The Yellow Turban rebels did not rise up suddenly, nor were they instructed by a cult or the Heavenly Emperor. Teachings and talismans were just a guise, just as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Boxers talked about what was a religion was一样的. Their only motivation was that they could no longer live in that society and had to find another way out. Thus, some radical elements organized them and trained them. Under the autocratic politics of that time, political activity by commoners was not easy. Therefore, organization and training had a strong religious color, which could both avoid the government's attention and expand publicity. Moreover, Zhang Jiao and his followers were all from the intellectual class, and their propaganda, organization, and planning must have been very good. Therefore, in more than ten years, the followers reached hundreds of thousands, and people from the eight provinces of Qing, Xu, Ji, Jing, Yang, and Yan all rose up in response. "In the spring of the first year of Zhongping, Zhang Jiao proclaimed himself the Yellow Heaven, and his subordinate masters had 360,000 troops, all wearing yellow turbans, rebelling on the same day. The people of Anping and Ganling each held their kings to respond to him." This force was truly not small and was incomparable to the student movement that criticised people. As a result, the peasants could not resist the government army. In less than a year, their leaders Zhang Jiao, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Bao all lost their lives. On the surface, it seemed that the government had won, but in reality, it was not so. The deaths of a few leaders could not eliminate the power of the masses. Their power spread throughout the country. Historical books say: "After the Zhang Jiao rebellion, bandits rose up everywhere and were too numerous to count. The large ones had twenty or thirty thousand people, and the small ones had six or seven thousand people." When Zhang Fei Yan of the Black Mountain bandits rose up, he claimed to have a million troops, and his momentum was the strongest. Seeing this serious situation, the government knew that it could not be solved by force alone. As a result, Zhang Fei Yan was given an official position, and that large group of people was incorporated into the standing army. There were also countless small groups of Yellow Turban remnants, and the government sent troops to fight for many years, but the more they fought, the more there were. Later, Cao Cao came out and recruited them. "He obtained more than 300,000 Rong soldiers and more than 1 million men and women." This number is a bit alarming. So many people lost their means of living in society and revolted. It was a serious social problem, and it was naturally impossible to solve it by using the method of suppressing bandits alone. However, since ancient times, the ruling class in Chinese history has been obsessed and likes to use this dead-end method.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the thoughts reflected by the scholars naturally had only two aspects. What was expressed in politics was the legalist doctrine of clear rewards and punishments and rectification of discipline; what was expressed in the view of life was the Taoist philosophy of preserving one's nature and 光義晦. Let's look at Zhongchang Tong, Cui Shi, and Xu Gan, who were known as Confucians at the time. In their works, they all strongly expressed these two colors. On the one hand, they spoke of political failures, and on the other hand, they spoke of Taoist studies. The politics at that time were so dark that they were the crimes of those maternal relatives and eunuchs. Therefore, Zhongchang Tong said with indignation: "If the government is not divided among the families of maternal relatives and power does not enter the gates of eunuchs, if there are no officials who invade homes below and no slanderous ministers in the capital, then the gods of heaven can descend and the gods of the earth can come out." (*治要昌言 in the Book of Tong*) If there were corrupt officials who exploited the people, then they should be punished by law. Therefore, he also said: "As for the time of revolution, if we do not征代用兵, then we cannot settle our careers. The formation of treacherous people cannot be broken if there are no strict punishments." Cui Shi was also a Confucian. He always used a set of theories of Wangzheng Virtue Teaching on weekdays. Later, after looking at the politics at that time, he felt that legalism was indispensable. He said: "刑罚者治乱之药石也，德敎者兴平之梁肉也." (*Treatise on Governance*) Moreover, he also opposed amnesty. He felt that amnesty would only increase criminal behavior. By the time of Xu Gan's *Zhong Lun*, it was even clearer to explain the importance of the rule of law for the politics at that time. In the "Rewards and Punishments" chapter, it is said very thoroughly. This kind of demand for political thought must have been very common at that time. Therefore, as soon as Cao Cao came to power, he implemented strict legalism. However, his kind of legalism did not把当时的政治　　, but only increased the oppression of the literati and deprived them of freedom of speech. Kong Rong, Mi Heng, Liu Zhen, and others all suffered greatly because of this. So　　份子, under that state, had to talk less about politics, or even not talk about politics, and talk more about metaphysical principles. The pure talk of Wei and Jin developed and prospered under this state.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Confucians who came from the Han Dynasty had a strong legalist ideology because of the chaos of the politics at that time. However, under that state of massacre and early oppression, the philosophy of life all tended towards Lao Zhuang. Xu Gan　一面攻撃老荘　异端, while speaking about the art of preserving one's body by being humble and self-guarding. Zhongchang Tong described his political ideals in his writings, but his philosophy of life was保性全　，　志乐命. Some people advised him to become an official, and he said: "All　帝王者，欲以立身　名耳. Face name does not always exist, life is easy to die, carefree and　仰, can self-error". His ideal governing, is " 安神開房思老氏之玄虛，呼吸精和求至人之彷每日，與達者數子論道講書，俯仰一樣，錯綜人物. 彈南風之猚操，發清商之妙曲. 消遙一世之上，脾　天地之間. 不受当时之责，永保性命之期，如是可以陵　汉出宇宙之外矣." (*Book of the Later Han, Biography of Zhongchang Tong*) Fame does not always　存, life is easy to die, what is the meaning of fighting for fame and profit? Coupled with the dark politics and incessant massacres. To preserve one's life, one can only be humble and self-guarding, discussing Taoism and books, hiding in the water and mountains, entrusting intentions to Zhuang and Lao. This philosophy of life; is also the philosophy of life of the Wei and Jin people. Therefore, Guo Linzong, who was wise and self-preserving and good at living in a corrupt world,衰　, who isolated himself from the world and died in a cave, and Shen Tu Pan, who saw the opportunity and hid in the tree, became models for the people of that time and became the eminent scholars in the Biographies of Eminent Scholars.</p>
<h3>Sculpture in China</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Sculpture in China has a long history, but due to a long period of interruption, it has not yet recovered its vitality.</p>
<p>Before the Qin and Han dynasties, sculpture did not have an independent status; it was merely an attached art. When Buddhism was introduced to China from India, there began to be stone statues in sculpture, and these sculptures were mostly made by stonemasons. Artistic expression was not yet considered, but the seeds of Chinese sculpture art were sown from then on and gradually developed.</p>
<p>We can see from the works and many rubbings left over from that time, such as the tomb of the King of Lu in Qufu, the stone figures and stone lions of the Gao Yi tomb, and the steles in various ancestral halls and temples. In terms of subject matter, they are nothing more than "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness," "stories of sages," "eulogies of merit," and even "scenes of war." In short, 100% are products of feudalism, Taoism, and patriarchal thought. In terms of technique, such as the line carvings on the four walls of the Xiaotangshan tomb and the relief carvings in the Wu Family Shrines, the proportions of various figures, vehicles, and horses are relatively accurate. The vividness of the postures and the fluency of the knife work were all unprecedented before the Qin and Han dynasties. However, the proportions of the various parts of the three-dimensional stone figures and stone lions are far from accurate, but they have a unique style of simplicity and decoration.</p>
<p>During the Three Kingdoms period, sculpture made no progress, and there are few relics. It was not until the Jin Dynasty when Buddhism revived, that large-scale statue making began. At this time, in addition to statues made of lacquer cloth, gilt (also known as hammered gold), and stone, bronze casting also emerged. As a result, the practice of carving statues in grottoes became popular during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of the Five Dynasties. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the trend of casting bronze Buddhist statues became even more prevalent. Emperor Ming of the Southern Song Dynasty and Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty advocated casting large bronze Buddhas. Emperor Ming of the Qi Dynasty created one thousand statues, Emperor Jianwen of the Liang Dynasty created one thousand statues, Emperor Wu of the Chen Dynasty created one million statues, and there were seven hundred temples in Jinling, Emperor Xuan created 1.3 million large Buddha statues...etc. All of these show the greatness of the projects at that time, which was an unprecedented golden age of statue art in our country. In the Northern Dynasties, Emperor Wencheng of the Wei Dynasty carved five stone grottoes in the Wuzhou Mountains of Datong Yungang (later gradually increased to more than twenty grottoes). When Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital to Luoyang, he carved stone grottoes in Longmen to create temples. From Emperor Xuanwu to Emperor Xiaoming, 800,000 workers were employed over a period of twenty-four years to build Laojun Cave, Binyang Cave, and so on. This shows the prosperity of sculpture in our country at that time. The Qi Dynasty's palace system had a "Grotto Supervisor," a position specifically responsible for managing the construction of carved stone statues. This further proves that if something is advocated by the ruling authorities, its results will surely be remarkable.</p>
<p>As for why the materials for sculpture at that time were mostly limited to Buddhist statues, it can be summarized in one sentence: it was because Buddhism was prevalent, forcing the general public to entrust their spirits to a "illusory God," and the people only sought blessings and avoidance of disasters. Therefore, the ruling authorities catered to this point and built vast and boundless realms in order to win the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>During the Sui Dynasty, Emperor Wen also issued an edict to repair Buddhist temples and newly created more than 100,000 statues of gold, silver, sandalwood, lacquer cloth, ivory, and stone, and repaired more than 1.5 million old Buddhist statues in various places. Emperor Yang carved and cast more than 3,800 bronze Buddhist statues and repaired more than 100,000 old statues... According to historical records, a total of more than 2.103 million statues were made at this time, the largest of which was more than 130 feet tall and was still being constructed. The difficulty of the project can be imagined.</p>
<p>Following the Sui Dynasty, until the late Tang Dynasty, the construction of Buddhist statues was still very prosperous. The skill and standardization of the forms were even greater than those of previous generations. Sculptors had already risen from early forced labor, officials, and servants to the same level as commoners, although they were still not qualified to stand shoulder to shoulder with the literati. By the Tang Dynasty, their social status gradually increased, and the names of the artists began to appear. The famous ones at that time who can be verified today include Yang Huizhi, Song Fazhi, Liu Jiulang, Zhang Xianqiao...etc. All of the above were famous masters of clay sculpture. Stone carving artists included Han Botong, Zhang Shou, Chen Jin...etc. Their statues still exist today, such as the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves, the Baosheng Temple in Wuzhong, and relics in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Gansu, and other places. Unfortunately, they have been neglected for a long time, and due to natural disasters and man-made damage, many have been destroyed, and few have been preserved. (It is said that a few years ago, a certain warlord used the heads of Buddha statues as targets for soldiers to practice shooting, destroying many.) As a result, they are in a dilapidated state. The national culture has gone bankrupt to such an extent that it cannot but make people sigh.</p>
<p>After the Song Dynasty, the art of sculpture gradually declined. Until now, although it has been influenced by the West again, the seeds sown by the ancients for thousands of years have gradually sprouted a few new shoots. However, just when these fragile new shoots needed to be cultivated, they encountered ruthless storms and the iron hooves of enemy cavalry, which trampled and destroyed them all. Sculpture! Sculpture! Your fate in China is so unfortunate!</p>
<h3>Why is Chinese Calligraphy Art?</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>The fact that Chinese calligraphy is art has been discussed quite a bit in foreign art circles, but not much in domestic art circles. Everyone has already recognized calligraphy as one of the six arts, so it seems that there is no need to discuss it. However, only knowing that it is so, but not knowing why it is so, is ultimately not a good approach.</p>
<p>Throughout history, there have been many books on Chinese calligraphy, but they all talk about brush techniques and calligraphers, etc., without studying why calligraphy is art. Kang Youwei's "Xu Guang Zhou Bian Ji" (Sequel to Art of Boat-engraving), the editing method can be considered modernized. However, he only discussed the origin of writing and did not mention the reason why calligraphy is art. One or two years before the War of Resistance, a professor at the Hangzhou Art School published an article in the supplement of the Southeast Daily, arguing that calligraphy is not art, which aroused the anger of a large number of artists, who rose up to criticize him. However, the artists who defended calligraphy as art only mentioned superficial points and did not touch on the fundamental issue. As a result, a discussion that lasted for several months ended in a melee, leaving the editor with no choice but to announce the suspension of the debate, ending it inconclusively. Why is calligraphy art? In the minds of most people, it is probably still a question. Now that the Shanghai Fine Arts Association is holding an exhibition, I would like to take this opportunity to express my opinion on why calligraphy is art. I think Chinese calligraphy is indeed art. Many foreigners say that calligraphy is abstract art. My opinion is exactly the opposite. I think calligraphy is the most concrete art. However, this art of calligraphy is limited to people who can read. Those who cannot read only see it as a kind of drawing.</p>
<p>We were originally believers in pantheism. Everything is a god. Writing is of course also a god. The creation of writing, when the sky rained millet and ghosts cried at night, is a myth. Even today, people still attach great importance to writing and cherish written paper, because writing is the essence of God. Calligraphers who sell writing for money, according to the theory of karma, will not have good karma, because they are selling the words of God. Engravers who carve words, which is like wounding the limbs of the characters, even more offend the sacredness of the writing, and will certainly not have good results. The talismans drawn by Zhang Tianshi are sacred, and the talismans are actually a form of writing.</p>
<p>There is really no doubt that our writing is divine. The characters in the dictionary are idols of writing, the embodiment of the writing-god. When we write, we are simply depicting the idols in the dictionary. We have always known that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. In fact, calligraphy and painting not only have the same origin, but even now, each independent character is still a picture. Our calligraphy has always emphasized spiritual likeness, and does not value formal likeness. Therefore, writing in regular and semi-cursive script is considered art. Those who are good at writing cursive script are even called "Grass Sage." Writing neat regular script is looked down upon, this has been the case for a long time, since the Tang and Song dynasties.</p>
<p>Writing is depicting the divine images of individual characters, writing is a form of painting, and writing is naturally an art. I wonder whether my opinion is correct, I still await the guidance of experts!</p>
<p>Long Serial</p>
<h3>Flying Together (44)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo, to save everyone's face, endured it at the time, but when the banquet ended in the evening, and she returned to her own room, she gave Li Hua a severe scolding without any mercy. She scolded her for being disobedient, which meant being unfilial, told her that learning opera meant learning skills; and threatened her that if she dared to be so ignorant again next time, she would disown her as a daughter.</p>
<p>Li Hua endured Mrs. Mo's rebuke without saying a word, only swallowing her tears into her stomach! This was the character she had developed since she was a child. She did not speak, but she knew what was what in her heart. Although she was only nine years old, she was like a mature young woman, and she already understood a lot about human affairs. When she was younger, she was influenced by Mr. Mo's education. In the past year or two, due to the changes in the environment, she had gained a lot of practical knowledge outside of books in this adverse current of life. Coupled with her innate intelligence, she was able to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. She clearly knew that everything Mrs. Mo was saying and doing now was wrong and bad; however, she was unwilling to argue, because she also knew that "arguing" was equal to zero, and Mrs. Mo would not listen to her. Besides, Mrs. Mo was, after all, her mother, and she had read the "Daughter's Classic." In order to abide by the principles of conduct taught in the book, she had to be filial! In order to be filial, she had no choice but to obey! In order to obey, she wronged herself and remained silent. Although she was very resentful and sad at this time!</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo saw that Li Hua looked very sad, but she did not cry. She was afraid that she would become ill, which would ruin her own hopes and dreams. So, she hurriedly changed her attitude and said in a gentle tone, half- coaxing, half-threatening:</p>
<p>"Mom only has you as a daughter now. Your brother is unfilial, and I won't pay attention to him anymore. As long as you listen to Mom, it's worth it for me to have doted on you. Mom is asking you to learn opera for your own good. As the saying goes, "Skill is never a burden"! If you have skills, not only will you be successful when you grow up, but I will also have someone to rely on when I get old! Otherwise, we have no family property and no rich and powerful relatives. What will we do in the future? I'm afraid we'll have to beg for food!"</p>
<p>This set of grand principles made Li Hua even more speechless and felt even more serious oppression! It almost crushed her weak soul! She bit her lip and decided to meet the impending calamity and the endless darkness of the future!</p>
<p>"Okay! Go to bed early and get up early tomorrow. Your teacher said that the best time to practice singing for opera is in the morning, and you can practice your skills with your Uncle You in the afternoon."</p>
<p>After Mrs. Mo finished this unhappy negotiation, she returned to her dream of vanity like a victor!</p>
<p>Li Hua hardly slept all night, and she was anxiously worried about the life that was about to begin tomorrow!</p>
<p>The next morning, Mrs. Mo woke up the two little sisters early in the morning. (Now, Li Yun still lives with Mrs. Mo.) Li Yun did not think so much or worry so terribly as Li Hua did. Naturally, it was also because she did not have Li Hua's wisdom. Her view of all human affairs was extremely innocent and simple. Her desire to play was still strong, and she regarded learning opera as nothing more than a new game, so she was very happy. But when she discovered the worried look on Li Hua's face, she could not help but be surprised. She asked Li Hua, but Li Hua ignored her. She also thought that maybe it was still because of what happened yesterday, and she had offended Li Hua and made Li Hua angry with her.</p>
<p>"Sister! Even if I was wrong, is that okay? You can scold me, you can beat me, just don't ignore me!" Li Yun pleaded.</p>
<p>Li Hua still did not open her mouth. She did not want to say anything, she knew that Li Yun would not understand even if she said it. She deeply felt that there was a distance between her and Li Yun.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian came, wearing a black satin melon-shaped cap with a red silk knot on top. He was wearing a blue silk gown with the sleeves rolled up high, as if deliberately revealing the sky-blue silk lining. On his feet, he wore a pair of black-ringed floral satin shoes and snow-white silk socks. Others thought he looked vulgar and unbearable, but he himself was very proud and thought he looked very handsome. As soon as he entered the door, he first took off the eating tool he carried with him—the Hu Qin—from his waist and carefully placed it on the table. Then, he took out two handwritten opera scripts from his sleeves. He put on a dignified and respectable air of a teacher. This was also because he had lost face yesterday, so he deliberately changed his attitude today, thinking of showing Li Hua his power, so that Li Hua would be afraid of him in the future.</p>

<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>After being away from my hometown for nine long years, I finally rushed from Western Zhejiang to Hangzhou, and then took the train back. After arriving at the station, I jumped off the train and looked at the scenery in front of me. Ah! This is the hometown that I have been missing day and night for nine years. I don't know why, but I was so happy that I almost jumped up.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the street, I quickly opened my eyes and looked around. I felt that the unfamiliar shops standing on both sides made me suspect that this was not the place where I had grown up since I was a child. When I quickly finished walking down a west street and turned the corner, I arrived at my own home. I ran into the courtyard, and my father was sitting in the courtyard smoking a water pipe. Hearing the sound of footsteps, he looked up. At first, he seemed to be looking at me with a strange look in his eyes. When I walked closer, he finally recognized my face and said in surprise:</p>
<p>"A Xin! You're back! The war has been stopped for a few months, why are you so late to come home?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to come back a long time ago, but I only recently received the demobilization order..." Before I could finish speaking, my younger sister had already heard the sound and ran out from inside. But she could no longer recognize that I was her second older brother.</p>
<p>"Pin Guan is fatter than before," I said, holding her hand.</p>
<p>"Little girl, don't you call out 'Second Brother'? Don't you recognize him? Silly!" Father said with a smile.</p>
<p>"I don't blame her, she was seven years old when I left. Of course she doesn't remember," I said, and walked into the living room with Father.</p>
<p>"Where is Mom?" I asked Father.</p>
<p>"Your mom died five years ago..." Father said, pointing to the photo hanging high on the wall. I hadn't noticed it before. When I heard this strange news, my nerves went numb and my hands felt cold. I dropped the suitcase in my hand and finally couldn't help but cry.</p>
<p>"What disease did she have? Why didn't you ever mention it in your letters?" I said, somewhat blaming Father.</p>
<p>"At that time, you were still in training and couldn't come back. Telling you would be in vain..." Father's deeply sunken eye sockets already showed a red circle.</p>
<p>At dinnertime, in addition to two regular dishes, Father specially asked Aunt Yun to add a plate of salted chicken, which I used to love to eat. However, I was thinking of my deceased mother. When I left this house nine years ago, my mother smiled and sent me to the door and said:</p>
<p>"Xin! I always hope that you will be successful in the future." My mother's reluctant and kind face is still deeply imprinted in my mind. I didn't expect that now I would still be returning with empty hands and could no longer hear my mother's voice and see her face. I thought to myself sadly, "I'm too sorry for my deceased mother." Although there were good dishes, I couldn't even swallow a bite of rice.</p>

<h3>Going to School</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wanqing</p>
<p>I took my child to school. As soon as I walked into the school gate, there was a mud pit in front of me. Needless to say, the child was upset, and I also became annoyed: "It's like this every day—it's so troublesome if it rains!"</p>
<p>I held the child over, close to the base of the wall. My toes were tight against the wall, so I didn't get my clothes dirty. I looked at the heel of my shoe and it had already stepped on a pile of mud. I was about to bend down and wipe it when a nanny shouted loudly from behind:</p>
<p>"Hurry up, other people still have to pass by!"</p>
<p>I stepped to the side, and a patch of mud had smeared onto the child's little pants at the base of the wall.</p>
<p>"What kind of broken school is this? I'm really angry. If I had known it was such a mud pit, I wouldn't have sent my child here!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it just because it's close to home and it's easier for adults? When it rains, how many schools in Shanghai aren't mud pits?"</p>
<p>A lady behind me also chimed in.</p>
<p>A long string of us, calling out and pushing each other, finally got our little darlings into the classroom. The classroom was very narrow, the floor was caved in, and there were only fifty or sixty small chairs, but more than a hundred students were enrolled. Two teachers were busy and sweating profusely. Just as they pressed one student into his seat, another stood up and ran away.</p>
<p>"Aunt Wu, go and catch him!" the teacher instructed.</p>
<p>"Oh! Why can't I find Liu Bingsheng?" Another teacher was checking the class roster.</p>
<p>"Mom, Mom, I want to go home, I want to go home!" A little girl in a red wool sweater tugged at the corner of a fat woman's cheongsam.</p>
<p>"Sister, sister, where did sister go?" A little boy of about five or six years old sat on a small chair and cried sadly, with a big new schoolbag hanging around his neck.</p>
<p>"I'll pick you up in a while. Listen to the teacher properly!" The parent spoke while holding a child who was a little over a year old. "There's really no way, there are too many children and they can't be looked after. The school can at least keep him for a few hours—at home, he'll run to the street in the blink of an eye."</p>
<p>"Aunt Wu, Aunt Wu, quickly get a washbasin!"</p>
<p>"Oh, the washbasin isn't enough, what about a chamber pot?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's leaking here too, it's all hitting my head. Quick, quick, quick, anything will do!"</p>
<p>"There's nothing left, only the chamber pot—is it okay for the elementary school students to pee in?"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, okay, bring it quickly!"</p>
<p>The voices of people and the sound of rain mixed together. The rain from the roof floated into the window, and the water outside the door flowed into the room. The classroom immediately became a river, and the children stopped crying and clapped their hands and laughed.</p>
<p>I picked up my child and rushed out into the rain. Both of my feet sank into the mud. I had thrown away nine thousand yuan in tuition for nothing. I got sick with my child and only got better after two weeks. I'm not sending my child to school anymore.</p>
<p>"That's right, our Liu Shun'er is the same. Because of this, even the old nanny doesn't want to work in our house anymore. She said, 'It's the same no matter where I work, but here, you have to go around several corners of the street to get food...'" A lady from the north was also saying loudly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Papa!..." Like a little pig about to be slaughtered, he chased out with a high-pitched voice. In the courtyard, he circled around his father, and the teacher also came out to catch him. The teacher went to the left, and he hid on the right. The teacher went to the right, and he hid on the left. The father got angry and slapped him: "You worthless thing!"</p>
<p>"Huh? Why did this child pee all over the floor? Aunt Wu, Aunt Wu, come quickly!" Another teacher was calling for help.</p>
<p>"Let's all play hide-and-seek together, one two three four...Sign up, why aren't the old students doing it anymore?"</p>
<p>The children ran all over the place. Two teachers and a nanny, having used up all their energy, each showed their great skills:</p>
<p>"Sit down, sit down, stand up, stand up..."</p>
<p>The parents were both the cheerleaders and the disciplinarians and the judges.</p>
<p>"Oh, what's wrong with you?" The Liu Shun'er mentioned above climbed onto the teacher's organ.</p>
<p>"Get down, get down, get down quickly,..." The teacher went over and picked him down.</p>
<p>Liu Shun'er was not convinced and cried out with a "Waaah" sound.</p>
<p>"...Mama..." A little girl's foot was stuck in the floor crack.</p>
<p>"They won't fix the floor, but they can't reduce the tuition!" the mother muttered, trying hard to pull the child out of the floor crack. The two teachers both blushed and stared at her without saying a word.</p>
<p>In the midst of the commotion, the rain fell again outside the door, pattering, splashing directly into the classroom.</p>
<p>The rain got heavier and heavier, and there was also a sound on the roof, pitter-patter...</p>
<h3>The Education of Deaf-Mute Children</h3>
<p>— Ri Xi</p>
<p>It is undeniable that our country is still in a stage of poverty. Before education is universalized, we certainly cannot aim too high and far, discussing how to establish deaf-mute schools, how to equip them, and other such issues. These seem not to be the immediate priorities. However, we are not the creators; we cannot, because there are no deaf-mute schools, prohibit the birth of deaf-mute children, nor can we, after they are born, let them spend their lives without education. For the congenital or acquired misfortune of deaf-mute children, every mother should take responsibility for educating them. Here, we might as well look at the true story of how Mrs. Newman in America took on the task of educating her own deaf-mute children.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newman was the wife of a clergyman, with an ordinary family background. Unfortunately, however, her four children, born one after another, were all born deaf. All her relatives and friends advised her to send them to a deaf-mute school, but she did not follow their advice. She had another idea in mind, namely to educate them herself. She taught the deaf-mute children to watch how the lips trembled, to distinguish what sound was being made, and how to say that sound. She declined all unnecessary social engagements, concentrating on educating her unfortunate children.</p>
<p>She believed that if the children failed to pronounce the sounds correctly, she should take responsibility for the failure; it was not the children's fault. The children began special education at the age of five or six. When she taught each word, she repeated it tirelessly, even forty or fifty times, calling the children's attention to her lips. To enhance the children's interest, Mrs. Newman often came up with games related to speaking, to have the children practice speaking. When they made progress, she would then teach them other new words.</p>
<p>During this period, Mrs. Newman's home suffered a fire, and almost everything was lost. But this did not diminish her confidence or undermine her will. She continued to work hard to educate her children. As a result, all four children were able to speak, although they still could not hear any sound. However, when they grew up, one became a state musician, one became an artist, one became a writer, and one was still studying dentistry at university. This academic achievement has a close relationship with Mrs. Newman's encouragement and cultivation.</p>
<p>From this example, we can see that a mother's determination and perseverance have a great impact on her children's happiness, while the quality of educational facilities is secondary. It is hoped that mothers will try Mrs. Newman's methods and spirit with their unfortunate deaf-mute children.</p>
