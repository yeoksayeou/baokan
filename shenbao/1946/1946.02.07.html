<h3 id="c1">恢復交通繼續商談中　修路工作正待開始　華北三月內可望通車 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電）恢復交通問題，雙方意見仍未接近，但協商會議旣吿成功，此局部問題亦不致僵至完全不能解決之嚴重局面。據悉，政府方面意見認爲交通必須維持過去一元化之傳統，不容割裂肢解，中共方面則堅持其鐵路中立化·民主化等原則，並提出具體要求：（一）黃河以北鐵路，中共得派兵參加管理，並增派路警。（二）中共節制區鐵路，由中共自行管理，此距離極遠之雙方意見，絕無接近之跡象。聞美方人員已表示，最好中共自行撤回其要求。葉僉英本有回延安請示之決定，刻因交通問題必須談出一輪廓，故又臨時展期。另據交通界消息各路週來平靜無事，僅隴海·同蒲尙有小破壞，由北平出發之搶修隊·趕工團，業已抵達各綫待修之起點元氏·泊頭·靑龍橋等地，惟共軍以未奉到命令爲辭，尙未准開始修築。交部華北特派員六日將與美專家希爾乘機飛津浦綫，低空視察各段破壞情形，以爲修復準備。聞政府修復華北鐵路經費約一百億，所需鐵軌擬將石德路錢存之鐵軌及北寗錢山海關至皇姑屯間各岔道拆去，暫時挪用。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕舉國急待之恢復交通問題，因各地停戰協議時發生之枝節問題尙未解決，修路工程一時實無法開始。據今日由津浦北段來客談，業已到達指定地點之工程隊及搶修隊，均於四日前接得共軍暫緩修路之通知。在停戰復路逐一實現以前，共軍之軍事部署，尙須以另一姿態完全之，共軍現正在大事調動，一俟其調動竣事，復路問題即可獲得協議，順利進行進行矣，姑拭目待之。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕交通界訊：各大鐵路經過長期之破壞後，鋼軌之損失，幾達六百公里之長，枕木之損失，約計一百二十萬根。鋼軌之修復，係採取火燒眉毛顧眼前之救急辦法，挪用拆卸各路支綫及貧道鐵軌補修之，但祗能勉强凑足五百公里，不足之數，尙須大傷腦筋。枕木正在各省設法採購中，據聞太行山中現尙藏有大量鋼軌，昔時曾以日行三十華里之輸送方法抬往者，倘未移作別用，誠心交還照樣抬下山來，不知又須耗費幾許時日，纔能完成，述此者乃爲一身負修路重任之靑年工程家，言未盡潛然淚下矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕交次凌鴻勛稱：各省政府對於代購枕木及徵集民工修路，非常熱心，各路對於修復計劃，均已準備就緒，修復費用，第一批亦均分發，各路所組工程隊及搶修隊，已開至待修地點，惟幾經交涉，尙未能開始工作，現執行部小組正在南北奔馳，深盼早有結果，則華北各路，兩三個月間，當可分別修復通車。</p>

<h3 id="c6">中國已不是「辮子時代」 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 徐鍾珮</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦　信〕最近英國一家名叫Sphere的畫報，載有大輻中國軍隊回南京的記事畫，畫上充分表示出人民的興奮，男女夾道歡呼，可是每個男人背後，都是長的拖着辮子一條。</p>
<p>直到現在為止，外國人對中國的了解，還是停留在「辮子時代」。有些外國老太太連珠砲的問題，常間得無從解答，你們的父母還出賣女兒？夫婦還是不相識的結婚？女人還要纏脚？其實從我一個人身上就可以全部否定這些問題。但，幾千年先人爲主的觀念，無從立刻讓位給三十年間演變成的　局面，我的出現不能使她們的問題得到解答，則覺得惶惑不解。</p>
<p>在一般外國人所知道的，中國男人是蔣委員長，女人是蔣夫人，其餘四萬萬五千萬都是賽珍珠筆下，在天　人禍下掙扎的好心農民。法國人對女人　論結婚與吾，愛稱Madame，在去年十二月巴黎的國際婦女大會裏，我們有一位姓姜的代表，坐在主席合上，我旁邊的一位芬蘭老太太，　　點點的告訴我，她知道美有二個姊妹，我搖頭說我們還是初識，不知道她的家庭情形，她圓睜着雙眼：「你連Madame　Chiang的家世也不知道」？蔣姜的英文拼法一樣，因此她一口咬定台上坐的是蔣夫人，對我嘮嘮叨叨的致敬了半天。美爲避免誤會，乖乖的把從不肯用的夫姓抬了出來，第二夭搖身變成了Madame　Lu。</p>
<p>據外國人所知，中國的女人是受男人壓迫，關在廚房裏的，在歷史上隱隱的記得慈禧太后曾經出現過在晚淸政治舞台，還有一個中國女人的影子是王寶釧——是熊式一筆下英國舞台上的王釧。謝謝克利浦斯夫人，她所組織的援華會，最近印了一本「中國婦女」小册，預備把中國的女傑介紹給英國，在那小冊子裏赫赫有名的呂鳳子先生，竟成爲中國女畫家的代表，還附有照片一張，他的名字和他藝術家作風的長髮，害他在英國從男畫家變成了女畫家。</p>
<p>中國地大物博，總算是已經世所週知，但博大到什麼程度，還是鮮有人知。一位電報局的女職員，拿着我發往南京的電報，竟不知南京在何處，吿訴她南京是中國首都時，她還硬說祗有重慶才是中國首都，似乎她對中國地理比我還熟得多。</p>
<p>外國印中國地岡時，愛標上標題，中國·蒙古·西藏·新疆及滿洲，因此大家都有一個錯誤印象，認爲西藏·蒙古·新疆和東北大概色色都是自成一體。有一個外國人聽說東北話比廣東話接近國語得多，他不禁大吃一驚，硬不相信，我十年來，他一直以爲東北自有一種不知怎樣古怪的語言文字。</p>
<p>外國人所知道的中國名產是瓷器，是茶葉（可是他們還是不知道中國吃茶不放糖，不加牛乳），是剌繡，中國字畫不能大欣賞，他們認爲中國人提起毛筆總是畫，不是寫，所以舊金山會後，中國代表用毛筆簽字，倫敦各報一律記載，中國代表把他們的各字賽成古體字簽名（PaintedTheir　Names　in　Andient　Chinese　Charac-ters），好像他們簽的名字是大篆小簽似的。</p>
<p>中宣部駐英代表葉公超，把他家藏先祖葉名琛的欽賜如意去修理，修好後店主非常客氣的說「囑修手杖一根，已經修好」（Dr.Yeh　Here　isYours　Waldng　Stick）。</p>
<p>這一串啼笑皆非的事實，都是由於束西方語言。文字。習俗不同所引起的誤解，要消除這種誤解，就要互相了解，要互相了解，就要供給人家瞭解我們的正確資料。緬甸一役，大家都在爭功，好萊塢的「緬甸之戰」裏，愛洛茀林以美國英雄出現，抹煞了英國，英國一面禁止道張影片和英國觀衆見面，一面趕製了一部以英國軍隊爲中心的「緬甸大捷」｛我們中國的遠征軍，曾經救過被圍的英軍五千，在緬北荒山　林裏拼過命，反而默默無聞。</p>
<p>前英國情報部遠東代表史各脫（R.H.Scott），在新加坡俘虜營歸來，寫了一篇盛讀中國馬來亞華僑的文章，他們帮助英國人通消息，運糧食，立下大功，但在國際間，如果沒有史氏的快筆，至今他們還只是無名英雄。</p>
<p>我們要人家了解我們的文化，我們的政治，我們的社會和生活，東方西方相會，不要專敎西方走來，東方也要迎面走去。我們在戰爭中的勝利，台兒莊一役外，其餘全是寂寂不爲人知，有些外國人連長沙三捷也從未聽過。</p>
<p>還有些外國報章和外國人，認爲中國共產黨對中國農業社會改進有辦法，因爲他們宣傳减租，宜傳把土地分給佃農，政府的减租政策，民生主義裏的扶植佃農和耕者有其田政策，外國幾無所聞，國民黨現在所實行的訓政，外國人更是莫明其妙，到底什麼叫訓政呀！</p>
<p>是的，對政策，對政令，對建設，我們要有解釋性的供人參考的資料。我們何能怨人誤解，何能怨人曲解—在自己　保持緘默的時侯。</p>
<p>西方人眞是渴望着了解東方，一切有關東方的資料全部吸收，那怕是錯誤的，爲什麼我們還不起來表白自己！我們不能讓流落在外的一部分無行華僑來代表中國，我們不能讓把中國當次殖民地的所謂中國間題專家，在他們國內錯誤的領導輿論，我們不能讓有些駐華外籍記者拍電歸國，認爲在上海工作的中國將軍不懂英文是奇怪。不，我們不能讓這一切繼續。</p>
<p>國與國的了解，才能消弭戰爭，小的誤解裏可以反應出大的誤解，泰晤士報依然稱王部畏爲世杰博士，依然把歸綏劃歸熱河省，我們要開口的地方太多了！</p>
<p>爲什麼我們不開口？爲什麼我們開口得這樣少？這樣小心？道樣顧忌？爲什麼我們讓歪曲的解釋在國外存在？含蓄保留，不是表達自己的辦法，在國際間，沉默似乎不是最好的語曾。（一月二十日寄）</p>
<h3 id="c7">東北蘇聯撤退問題　雙方正在商談中　吳部長昨答覆記者詢問 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶六日電〕中宣部長吳國楨今日答復記者稱：關於蘇軍自東北撒退問題，中國正與蘇聯商談中。撇退完竣日期，規定爲二月一日，蘇聯並未正式要求延長，中國方面亦未要求蘇軍展期，蘇軍遲延不撇，大抵爲交通困難之故。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平六日電〕今日北平兩家報紙刋載之論文，顯示蘇軍或不能於春季前完成東北之撤退工作。一世界日報」載：東北之煤炭商及食物批發公司與蘇軍簽訂之合同在一月底滿期者，業已重訂新合同，展期至五月底。此點顯示蘇方之計劃並不準備在未來四個月中實行自東北撤退。</p>

<p>飽購　V隊亦基實力籃球聯賽，昨日原屬無甚緊張之戰，不料甲一甲兩二部兩塲均有劇烈之戰情，梁溪險勝汕隊，德勝亦在危險萬分中小勝V隊，女組則V隊輕取强華。茲叙簡情如次：</p>
<p>女組V隊第一節以一〇對四勝，第二節局勢依然，結果爲一七對一〇，V隊佔先，第三節强華竟一無所獲，V隊得六分，最後一節，各得二球，終結果爲二七對一四，V隊克強華。　繼甲二部總勝V隊交綏，上場後德勝即一路佔先，曾以一七對六佔絕對優勢，詎意V隊此時突見活躍，陳成吉祝明星發無不中，透成上半時二三對二〇之勝利，下半時V隊初能保持常情，以三一對廿四佔前，德勝不得已叫停後，果見得勢，陶紹生鄒自仁最爲順手，終得以卅九對卅五擊退V隊。</p>
<p>末塲甲一部汕隊梁溪相鬥，初以爲汕隊可操必勝之勢，豈知梁溪昨極能振作，張少卿陶瑩石頗能竄射，上半時分數爲二一對一八，汕隊多一球半而已。下半時梁溪愈戰愈盛，曾以二六對二二，二八對二六，二度超前，汕隊急起直追，林維聰陳淸江馬燦希奮不顧身，得以未出冷門，險哉，比數汕隊三九，梁溪三六，下半時之比數，未分勝負。</p>

<p>— 陳復華</p>
<p>成立有六年多的歷史的西北大學，其前身爲北平師範大學及北平大學。誕生的日子雖短，却具有極光榮的傳統。</p>
<p>她設在陝西城固，爲幅員遼闊的西北培植了不少人材，促進西北敎育的發達，使城固形成一所文化中心。</p>
<p>開發西北的呼聲，戰前即已高響入雲，在抗戰勝利建國伊始的今日，西北各地的重要性更形增加，如何鞏固邊防？如何建設西北？這種艱鉅的使命，無疑的需要西北大學來負荷。所以國內有識之士對她都非常重視，並寄以股切的期望。</p>
<p>校長劉季洪</p>
<p>現任校長劉季洪氏，辦理敎育素具熱忱，曩者曾主河大校政四年，卓著成績：自前年出長西大後，增聘敎授，擴充設備，對校務積極整領，一切煥然一新。他的方針，是在安定中，求進步，使學校各方面能日臻佳境。</p>
<p>校內重大事項，悉取決於校務會議。該會議由校長主持，各院處長，系主任，及敎授代表，均出席參加，開會時各抒所見，自由討論，議決後則照案施行，絕無變更。</p>
<p>西大重視行政效率，對職員考動極爲注意。各處組室辦公人員皆準時到班努力工作，所以各項事務的處理，均極迅速確實，有條不紊。</p>
<p>全校三學院</p>
<p>現全校分文·理·法商三學院，包括中國文學，外國語文·歷史·邊政·敎育·數學·物理·化學·生物·地質地理·法律·政治·經濟·商學等學系。就</p>
<p>中外國語文·地質地理·法律三系·復析爲英文·俄文·地質·地理·法理·司法等組，共計十七系組，規模日趨龐大。本學期文·俄文·德文·日文·維吾爾文·藏文等項，將來遷西安後，尙擬增設需要院系。</p>
<p>師資陣容頗爲齊整，各系敎授原多講學師大平大，著述宏富，海內知名，抗戰軍興，始避地南來。近年新目各方延聘碩學之士，爲數亦多。現在全校敎授百人之中，服務十年者已逾半數，且有任敎達二十五年以上者：多貝安貧樂道誨人不倦的精神，用能專心敎學，不輕遷易，在師資缺乏的目前，有如此基礎，實在難能。</p>
<p>圖書數萬冊</p>
<p>設備方面，以師大，平大舊有之圖書儀器全未携出，殊感未足，惟近年自國內外睦續添置，已稍充備，現有中西文圖書雜誌數萬册，標本儀器藥品數千種，其已訂購尙在運送途中者，亦有相當數量。此外有關西北各省文物之歷代建築繪圖，寫生圖案之繪晝碑碣造像之拓片，雕刻壁畫史蹟民俗之照片，及一般古物，共納千餘件，蒐集豐富，彌足珍貴，故目前普通實騐與必要參考，略可敷用。</p>
<p>學生千餘人</p>
<p>在校學生一千餘人，來自二十五省市，就中以籍隸陝·豫·冀·晋·魯·諸省者爲最多。</p>
<p>研究空氣極爲濃厚：圖書館及期刊閱覽室，輒吿人滿；經常由敎授舉行學術講演，聽衆踴躍，座無虛席；各學會各學社，如雨後春笋，相繼成立，每逢紀念日皆競出特刊，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收。</p>
<p>永久校址，早經定爲西安，校舍亦由敎部指撥東北大學舊址，刻正積極籌備，接收修繕，並決定於五月初開始北移。全校員生咸感興奮，希望於遷至西安後，各項建設悉能依照預定計劃迅速完成，爲新生中國的敎育史上展開更新的一頁。（卅五年一月廿六日寄自城固）</p>

<h3 id="c45">二百四十公里雪中旅行　哈爾濱風景綫　東北同胞說：以往十四年中，像在爬高山，現在才是爬上了最後一步　中央社記者鍾鶴年寄自哈爾濱 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>十二月二十六日下午兩點二十分，長春正飛着鵝毛雪片。哈爾濱市政府接收人員一行二十七人，乘車首途赴哈。這是東北北部接收工作開始的第一步，應當算爲一件大事。記者匆忙中輕裝離開了長春，和他們結伴同行。</p>
<p>長春到哈爾濱，是二百四十二公里，沿綫景物對於十四年來想見而不得見的人們，自然是最感興趣的對象，惜乎二十六日車行中道，夜幕已張，長哈全綫，僅只看到了長春北去的一段，但經過六天之後，張嘉璈氏由哈返長，記者隨車南返，曉霧中又和哈爾濱吿別。這次不僅看到了前次籠罩在漆黑夜空裏的形形色色，並且還重溫了迤南上次所見的原野，到處是一片白色，而凝神諦視，所有一切，那怕是一羣散放在雪地中的無　牛馬，或者是遠在天邊的一顆小樹，都特別覺得惹眼。</p>
<h3 id="c46">經長哈全綫窺破日用意陰狠 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>哈爾濱方面諸站，農村較密，堆在車站上的糧袋，一站看到，另一站又可以看到，高高堆着，食糧充裕的鐘頭，顯然擺在眼底。「屯子」固然沒有想像中那麼氣派偉大，屋瓦連垣，但比起長春方面諸站所見的農舍，稀疎低矮而簡陋，呈現一種荒寒的景象，確實要高明許多。東北人常說：日本統治東北時，就是要使南北懸殊：「南滿」無飯吃，「北滿」無衣穿，經過了長哈全綫，可以看出日本人用心的陰狠。</p>
<p>車離長春時，在半小時左右，可以看到工廠建築的舊址，高高的烟囪聳立雲霄，却沒有繚繞的靑烟，使人感覺寂寞而凄凉。</p>
<p>雙城堡宮殿式的率站，依然如故，雖然顏色有些灰敗，但還未失去當年的原形。而沿綫站名給日本侵略者改去的很多，像熟知的「窰門」，現在被改稱爲「德惠」。</p>
<h3 id="c47">車地松花江人人掀起禾黍感 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>廿六日車抵哈爾濱時，是在夜裏十點半鐘。</p>
<p>途次夜幕拉開時，車中的旅伴一，都微感到了一點倦意。這時，車身爬上了名水松花江的大橋，旅伴之一，哼出了，「我的家在東北松花江上」的歌聲，前塵往事悵觸萬端。我們旣有以往思家不得歸的創痛，正當珍愛我們的現在。</p>
<p>哈市在下午十點半鐘，街上早已寂然無聲，市民們的生活和長春的一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c48">哈爾濱飛雪偉大中顯出美麗 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>在我國城市當中，哈爾濱要算是最美麗的城市之一。老哈爾濱固然會說：在冬季雪封東北的時候，哈爾濱只能說是「偉大」，遍地白色，俄羅斯式建築的屋頂，喇嘛台上高聳的塔尖，光禿的樹枝，無不在雪的色被之中，而素凈裏也只能顯出偉大，但是記者却說：偉大裏還是遮掩不了美麗的特色。當漫步在南崗或者這裏的中國大街時，歐陸的情調會浮現在腦際，甚至在某些地方會令人想起上海，在道外使人想起了天津，而大觀園一帶使人自然聯想到北平的天橋。名水松花江上，浩渺一片，通滿洲里的松花江鐵橋，橫跨江上，下面有雪撬——當地稱爲鈀犁——馳騁，使人興無限依　的情思。種特殊的美。女孩們頭上勒上一塊顏色鮮艷的帕子，蓋着後頸，前額都高高蓬起一束頭髮。雪花停在上面，不管是黃髮的外國女郎。黑髮的中國小姐，陪襯着紅潤的面頰，更顯得她們健康而嫵媚。</p>
<h3 id="c49">無風頂有名目下生涯極清淡 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>商店十之七八都復了業，馳名的秋林洋行，維多利亞飯店，每天都有很多的顧客，尤其在將近新年的那幾天，許多僑民都紛紛爭購年貨，買得一件東西，經過付款取貨等手績，幾乎得需一刻鐘等侯。哈爾濱的舞風是有名的，現在雖有舞廳幾家，生意却極淸淡。頂負盛名的馬笛兒飯店，現在還是兵營，而這樣已是顯出了哈爾濱的繁榮，比起長春商業中心和政治中心，各具一種風趣。</p>
<p>哈爾濱除外國商人都說中國話外，山東河北的人也極多，道事山東帮佔優勢，道外是河北帮的勢力。外國人計有二十餘國人民，僑居哈市，據三十二年調查，美國有九人，英國有三十三人，，但年來已經很少了。據說：美無一人，英只有兩位老處女留居哈市。哈爾濱婦女職業除文化敎育等界外，尙有所謂藝妓等等</p>
<p>哈市外人旣多，哈爾濱人語言能力都相當强，一個人說兩三國話，算很普通。舉一個例，目前中長戰路局哈爾濱通長春的長途電話，其他話路不通，要想兩方面能够講話，非用蘇日兩種語言，話便無從講起。哈爾濱人說一句笑話，有錢的人無不想：家中有一個日本下女，白俄車夫，因爲不這樣，有錢人不足以言享受</p>
<p>目前東北有一個敎育上亟待注意的問題，便是「恊和語」毒化太深，像「攝影」稱爲「寫眞」，「廣播」稱爲「放送」，本來華北一帶也有這樣的說法，但不像東北這樣普遍，也不做東北有些文章令人難懂，不過哈爾濱稍微好些，當地報紙「協和語」較長春確實要少得多。</p>
<h3 id="c50">可愛的人民爬上了一座高峯 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>東北的人民是普遍的可愛，經過了十四年奴役的生活，他們對於祖國的熱戀，對於國家那一種强烈的向心力，簡直非記者禿筆所能形容。哈市府元旦接收後，市府門前，市民對於楊綽庵市長狂熱歡呼的一幕，這裏不必重提，記者且把廿八日參觀哈爾濱經緯小學老校長張士修談的一段話錄下，以見東北人民近數月來心理上的狀態一斑，並以之作爲本文的結束，他說：「十四年來盼望的日子終於到了，那曉得自「八一五」到現在快四個多月當中，才見着中央接收人員到來，這四個多月當中，眞難得忍受，正好像以往十四年中是在爬一座高山，「八一五」到了，也就是快登山頂還差一步的時侯，而這最後一步，眼巴巴爬不上去，掙扎忍受，掙扎忍受，掙扎忍受到現在」。</p>
<p>他設話的時候，沈下了氣，眼睛望着地下，當說完最後一句，揚起的目光，和記者的視綫接觸時，他臉上眞露出爬到了山頂的表情。</p>

<p>雷克上校等一行於一月十九日上午十一時由濟乘專車赴難浦路沿綫調查，並到泰安調處國共軍衝突，濟南泰安間國共軍分別駐防，客車每日開行一次次，交界地須經雙方檢查。自濟南以南白馬山·　家莊·炒米店·箇張·夏靑·楊樹各站，均有國軍駐防靑楊樹以南四公里，即爲共軍區，以南萬德界首以迄泰安各站，均由共軍駐守，雖防地相接，已無衝突，專車所過，軍民盛大歡迎，共軍區域因事前未得通知，經說明後始得前進，下午四時半，抵泰安站，中共魯中區第一專署專員趙篤生，泰安縣長方偉，駐軍團長程葉棠，率軍民在站歡迎。二十日上午，雙方代表開會商談解決衝突辦法。按泰安之形勢，城內及西關在國軍手中，車站及西關之西端在共軍手中。雙方相持於西關，雖已停止開火，但雙方防禦工事均在中間，相距不及百米，槍剌相對，局面依然緊張。據城內守軍寗春霖等報告，車站本爲國軍防地，一月十五日共軍利用日軍北開之機會，强行侵入，車站守軍，爲遵守她戰命令，力避衝突，並經請示上峯核准，忍痛撤退，向曾克氏等要求恢復十三日停戰命令以前軍事狀態，且共軍封鎖泰城，軍民食糧困乏，乞請共軍停止封鎖，准許不帶武裝軍民微購物資入內·東太平日軍窪內部隊，奉令開濟繳械，亦被共軍阻止，不能成行，應令日軍北上，以符聯合國受降日軍之規定，當由雷克上校根據國家第一政黨第一之原則提出七項意見：（一）立即停止一切軍事行動，服從雙方命令。（雙方同意）（二）立即停止一切破壞擾民偸盜等行動。（雙方同意）（三）雙方共同保障鐵路建築，使交通暢通，不受障礎。（同時雷克氏並說明本人於離平時，接馬歇爾元帥電令迅速設法恢復濟南徐州間之交通。）（雙方同意）（四）雙方人民出入自由（雙方同意）（五）使現在大汶口東太平之日軍四千餘人，向濟南集中繳械，共軍不加阻止。（中共表示：如徒手時可以使共通過，武裝敵軍則恐有衝突，當決定此事俟中共代表到濟會商後再辦。）（六）雙方互相扣留之人應即釋放。（雙方同意）（七）恢復停戰日期生效時間十三日前事狀態。（雙方又起爭辯，雷氏當修正辦法，國軍退往城內，共軍退出車站，在車站上雙方均不住兵，由路警負責，共軍不同意，國軍亦表示不能放棄西關。最後商定仍保持現在軍事姿態，雙方各自保設絕不放槍，並各將防禦陣碍物，一律撤除，以示和平。城內國軍不帶武器出外征購食糧，共軍不予阻止，倘犯以上各條，雷氏等得訊即來處置，當晚乘原車返回濟南，二十一日雷氏等按預定行程，專車赴膠濟路張店視察，正努力問，而泰安之衝突又起，直至二十三日下午，由張店歸來後，始於二十四日上午八時再乘軍重到泰安，爲加速效率，直駛泰安，開始商談停止衝突有效辦法未獲圓滿結果，五時，雷氏等返回車站，再與趙篤生等會談，當由政府代表涂叔五，中共代表陳叔亮，咸以至誠保證雙方絕對不先開第一槍。雷氏嗣向中共方面盤稱：因城內民衆乏食，現有麵粉五百袋，隨專車帶來，請中共代表陳叔亮向共軍通知，准許城內守軍搬運入城，以濟民食，共軍當允照辦，惟須徒手兵士方可。至九時許即由車站全數運人城內，雷克上校對此極感雙方之和平誠意，興奮愉快。十時專車離泰，二十五日零時三十分返抵濟南，泰安再起之風波於焉平息。</p>

<h3 id="c54">工潮之危機 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>主筆大鑒：上海近一二月來罷工之事，層出不窮，有愈趨愈烈之勢，其初政府及輿論界，不免抱資方對勞方應處優容之宗旨，解決工潮。資方以血本關係不願與勞方多結惡感，寗可吃虧，得了結且了結。詎知別有作用者乘機而入，多方煽動，致今日發生此最危險之現象。查現在各大工廠工人之待遇，並不减於八一三前。試查政府大小各機關中下級職官薪俸，遠不及工人工資之大，再查各工人除有技術經騐者外，政府機關中下級職官學問資歷以及所負責任，遠比工廠工人爲高，平乎不平乎？國家現方彌平空前大難，正跨上復興建國之途。工商業正需國內資本家及各友邦人士，投資經營。乃今日一怠工，明日一罷工，誰敢再以有限之資金，供無謂之消耗？各工廠工人與資方應抱痛癢相關之心情來工作，然后操業方能持久，國家亦可復典。吾則，余敢斷言，上海今後工廠必日少一日，各工廠工人謀生，亦必日難一日，國家亦必日窮一日。余曾歷遊歐美，每見工廠工人有所要求而罷工，經合法機關調解而不能復工者，政府只得暫收歸公有，由軍隊維持廠中秩序開工。彼最先進之民主國美利堅，即常採用此手段，我政府大可倣照辦理。我輿論界亦應從大處着墨，不能再一味發偏袒之論調，庶工商業日進無疆，國家幸甚，人民幸甚。張力仁啓。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3 id="c56">不願信其為「有」的事情 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>春節前夕，傳來了政協會議圓滿成就的好消息，眞如蔣主席閉幕詞中所說，「祥和協調，」「愈顯光明。」前天主席接見外國記者，又說甚願各黨派永久合作，共同負責建設國家；尤其對於讀者文摘記者的答覆，認政權是一種責任而非權利，並且代表全國人民，相信共產黨對於「軍隊國家化」一點必能切實作到，這更令我們確信中國歷史目前已經翻開了新頁，光明燦爛，希望無窮。</p>
<p>在政協會議召開之前，及會議進行期間，我們始終主張只有各方面拿出一片誠心來，互尊互信互忍互讓，方能使中國眞正走上民主政治的大道。在全國人民「只許成功，不許失敗」的呼號之下，政協會議果然圓滿閉幕，這多少是誠信的感召。尤其在政府方面，我們可以看得出許多光明忍讓的地方。例如：開幕之晨，主席毅然將熱河地區的爭點除外，打破了三人小組的僵局，使停止衝突令畢竟頒發，又當大會之前，鄭重指示四項保障人民自由的辦法，先爲會議造成良好的空氣。迨會議分組商討，政府對各案亦多隨時讓步，儘量表示寬大。擴大政府組織，在憲政實施以前，容納各黨派人士及社會賢達，共同參加，無非爲和平團結開闢道路。憲草一案，政府也大事遷就，所商修改原則，甚至不惜將「權能分立」「人民有權政府有能」的五權憲法原理也變了質，使今後的政府落入了一個「互相牽制，動彈不得」的舊窠臼裹去。軍事問題的決議案，連共產黨軍隊應該縮編爲若干師都不明定，反先將中央軍隊於六個月內縮編爲九十師明自規定，以示大公。諸如此類，政府的重大讓步，以求會議之圓滿成功，恐怕就是向與致府對立的人，也不能不承認了吧。國民黨代表常常自稱爲第一大黨，由於認政權爲責任而非權利的一念，所以只要有利於國，有益於民，只要能够眞正做到「政治民主化，軍隊國家化，」其他一切無有不可忍讓。就憑了道點寬大忍讓的精神，居然收獲了奠定和平建國基礎的效果。「誠信」原是互相感通的東西。同是人類，同具天性，何况同爲中國國民？你有誠信，自然我也會有誠信。因此，我們也相信主席答覆外國記者的保證，「相信共產黨對軍隊國家化一點必能切實做到」這一層，他是有了把握纔坦白說出來的，</p>
<p>不過，這兩旬以來，從各方面傳來的電訊，也竟有許多令人不敢相信眞會還有的事情。憑理智說，我們以爲宜無其事；但就事實說，居然有這些報道。我們明知政府爲表示謀取和平解決的誠意，不願將此類「刺耳」的事件公佈。但政治旣要求走上民主軌道，民主作風就要讓人民知道事實，公開評論，一味隱飾忌諱，並非民主國家的常經。據我們所得的消息，旬日以來，各地尙有若斷若續的共軍行動。舉其比較重要的如下：</p>
<p>（一）熱河方面：（1）赤峯共軍改稱保安隊，上月下旬以來，在城內搶刼仇殺，破壞乃林車站，並迫令民衆向調處執行小組建議赤峯自治。（2）寗城瓦房一帶及綏中建昌間調動頻繁，企圖包圍國軍側背。</p>
<p>（二）遼寗方面：（1）瀋陽東南淸原，撫順，本溪湖一帶共軍，積極向瀋陽西南西北集結中，企圖攻入市區。（2）溝幫子至盤山鐵路橋樑均被破壞。（3）營口共軍重佔該城後，騷擾不已。</p>
<p>（三）河北方面：（1）圍攻元氏。（2）阻止修復路軌。（3）圖攻建昌，已佔天義車站。</p>
<p>（四）山西方面：（1）同蒲路南段，連遭破壞。東光連鎭已被佔，汨頭尙在被圍中。（2）浮山翼城被佔。（3）娘子關一帶共軍阻撓正太路交通。（4）臨汾共軍積極西犯。（5）共軍陷寗固，攻蒙城。（6）共軍焚燒曲沃城關民房，力圖攻城。（7）國攻沁縣。</p>
<p>（五）山東方面：（1）猛攻即墨並企圖圍攻兗州。（2）津浦綫猛攻聊城。（3）膠濟綫猛攻益都。</p>
<p>（六）河南方面：（1）滑縣共軍南犯。（2）封邱延津邊境續有攻勢。企圖攻佔延津。（3）阻撓平漢路綫之修復。</p>
<p>（七）皖北方面：（1）共軍進攻，英霍間大別山根據地之西界嶺。</p>
<p>（八）蘇北方面：（1）東台共軍在溱　四週騷動。（2）儀徵共軍積極擴軍。（3）六合共軍向胥渡橋一帶侵犯。（4）圍攻東海。（5）灌雲共軍由束西陽莊進犯，佔朱麻。（6）共軍向如　之蒲鎮侵襲。（7）共軍攻佔新安鎮，阿湖，牛山，新浦，白塔埠等車站。鐵路橋樑悉被破壞。</p>
<p>（九）湖北方面：（1）共軍繼續破壞各地電信設備。</p>
<p>此外，據太原鐵路局公吿，共軍破壞該路的總長計達一百二十五公里七百零五公尺。而據北平華北日報揭載：則津浦路泰安方面於上月中旬被毀三十餘公里；平漢路安陽方面鐵軌被拆去千餘條；同蒲路東觀附近，被毀橋棵九座，鐵路的四十公里；白晉路方面被毀橋樑一座，電綫三公里，鐵軌四百三十公尺。這些破壞交通以及阻擾修路的共軍活動，都是在停止衝突令生效兩旬以來的不幸事件。</p>
<p>無論如何，這些不應再有的軍事行動，現在各地陸續發生，是事覽。但爲中開大局着想，爲實現和平建國的方案計，我們又極不願相信這些竟是事實！在這事實與希望的矛盾之中，我們對於官方絕未宜布此類消息的苦心，自應充分諒解；然而我們對於軍事調處執行部握有大權，在分派小組到各地調查事實以後，至今絕無任何制止或懲處的舉措，却不能有什麼理由爲他辯護。</p>
<p>單就道一件停止衝突恢復交通的協議來看，拖延將近一月，尙不能完全澈底的做到，那末，整編共軍，使之「軍隊國家化」，更不知要等到何年何月！但是，二十多天祥和協調的政協會議，辛辛苦苦，舌敝脣焦，如果到頭來在事實上不能做到眞正的「軍隊國家化」，讓軍專小組再來遷延敷衍，掩耳盜鈴，一國之內仍聽任有不受政府節制調遣的「自主軍隊」逍遙自在，飛揚跋扈，則我們將見「和平建國」還不過是一句悅耳的空口白話，究竟有什麼價値？惟共如此，我們誠懇的切望中國共產黨應該改改作風，眞心誠意的停止街突，恢復交通，並從速「還軍於國」。</p>
<p>現在最時髦流行的名詞是民主。民主次不是軍主，故要求民主，而不肯放棄軍隊，那依然是「軍主」心理在作怪。我們不願相信今天還會有崇拜「軍主」的政黨。民主是全民作主，次不是個人作主，只讓我個人作主，乃是獨裁而非民主，故民主必非「我主」。果大家各自割據地盤把持眾隊，不肯交給整個國家，仍然保留「國中有國」的奇形怪狀，那就無異只許一黨專政，不准人民參政，只許我作主，不准民作主的作風。我們也不願相信今天還會有口唱民主而心中留戀獨裁專政的政黨。因此，我們不但很愉快的看見國民黨有寬大忍讓的作風，而更願見第二大黨的共產黨也眞來改改作風，眞能如周恩來氏所說用政治主張來競賽，不再用擁兵割據的方法來分裂國家。我們但願從此不再聽見共軍有什麼令人「刺耳」的消息，而更進一步從此不再聽見有什麼「共軍」的刺耳名詞！必如此，中國光明燦爛的前途始不致重爲陰　所籠罩！</p>
<h3 id="c57">兗州苦厄　民眾長跪求和平 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>雷克上校廿五日，偕同國共代表涂叙五陳叔亮，午刻乘專機由濟飛抵兗州，首先會見當地政府住軍第一縱隊指揮官吳化文，滋陽縣長馬光漢，據吳報吿：兗州守軍係居被攻地位，未出外一步，完全自衛而戰。自一月八日，兗城即被共軍圍攻，兗州北，南，西，三關，均爲共軍所佔，惟城垣及東關機場，均仍在國軍手中，奉到停戰令時，共軍進攻益急，蓋欲於十三日以前攻佔兗州，十三日共軍向城內共發千餘砲，守軍傷亡三百人，民衆五十餘人，共軍利用雲梯登城，曾兩度攻入城內，但均被擊退。十三日晚，共軍始停正式攻擊，迄第二次焦點命下，始於廿一日撤其北，西，南三關之圍，仍間有一小部向城內發砲放槍，取包圍形勢，且禁物資入城。當要求（一）請令共軍遵照執行第二號停戰命令撤至六十華里以外。（二）停止封鎖，許人民採購食糧燃料入城。後霄克氏接見民衆代表並講演。據賀鍵對兩代表談，自十三日停戰命令限滿後，即停止軍事行動並令圍城軍隊一律撇退至離城數里之外，如奉到第二號命令，當絕對繼續遵行，現在保證絕不再放槍，但城內軍隊仍不時向外放槍，亦請其不再放槍。至城內人民出城購買食糧，燃料，定不加阻止，但城內守軍亦應開城，任人民自由出入，泰安徐州間之交通，當儘力修復，以便通車。涂陳兩代表當晚國城，向雷氏報吿，二十六日電等擬回濟南，比至門外，見有民衆數千人，跪地泣求和平，且城內難民有五萬餘人，煤糧俱缺，已有數人餓斃，請速解城國，以救民命，衆皆爲之泣下。雷克及陳叔亮說明，今後絕不致再行衝突，陳亦向民衆說明担保共軍今後絕不再放一槍，民衆乃含泣散去，但自機場飛起，天寒降雪，氣候不佳，乃中途折返兗州，大雪竟日入夜不休。二十七日晨見滿城銀裝，槍砲不聞，戰氛盡滌，當於下午一時離兗北飛，至濟南時因天侯不能降落，擬改飛北平，比及德縣附近，氣侯業見好轉，又折回南飛，迄下午四時十五分，始平安到濟，關於共軍在山東方面繳日軍械之爭端，將另　陳述一切。（二十八日寄自濟南）</p>

<h3 id="c58">政治協商已獲成果　應解除民生疾苦　奚玉書主張速成立參議會 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊）記者頃往訪國民參政員上海市代表奚玉書氏，叩詢關於政治協商會議之前瞻，及本市市政等問題，奚氏發表談話，以爲國家勝利，民衆亟袋巡得生活上之安定，解決民生痛苦實爲施政上唯一要點。茲分誌所談各項如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於政治協商會議，奚氏稱：現在全國民衆所關切的，倒不是某黨某派利害的爭議，乃是如何趕快解決全國</p>
<p>民眾生活</p>
<p>上痛苦的間題。像停戰令下了已久，各地交通仍遲遲不能恢復，留在後方苦了八年的同胞，依舊有家歸不得。加以物價高，生活苦，民怨沸騰，這些都應該怪誰？所以要即速實行「還政於民，還軍於國，」並應體味將主席於閉幕詞內所宣示的：「我們要有確實的統一，才有眞正的民主」這一句話。現在協商雖吿成功，希望將商定各點切實履行，不要再有任何推托，才對得起人民。我們站在老百姓的立塲，要求立刻爲民衆</p>
<p>解除疾苦</p>
<p>吾則一切都是空談。（二）本市臨時參議會，奚氏之意：目前各地正式的參議會已吿成立，而上海國際第三大都市，竟連臨時參議會都未產生。眼前需要一個民意機構，比任何時任何地都來得迫切，但因爲保甲尙不編整，所以不得不有臨時參議會這一個過程，但是要設立，就應該趕快，而且將這一個過程盡量縮短。總望上海能早日走上。</p>
<p>真正民主</p>
<p>的道路，成爲全國民主的模範市。（三）關於市財政，奚氏稱：本市財政的支細，確甚嚴重。因原有主要稅源，如土地營業等稅，新制劃歸中央，而中央應補助的經費，又不能如期照發，所以目前市庫收支相差竟在半數以上。市民應體諒並忍受酌增的賦稅，但希望</p>
<p>地方負担</p>
<p>依舊用之于地方，復典困頓八年的上海市。中央如欲扶助東方最大都市的復興，應該仿照英美政府對地方的補助金制度，由中央預算規定，特撥鉅額補助金，地方建設方有辦法，本市財政問題，方能整個解決。</p>

<p>逃避物資又獲三起</p>
<p>又該組於最近十日內查獲敵僞逃避之物資，其中較重大者有三起：（一）機器帆船十二艘，該項帆船爲日海軍所有，但我方海軍當局於接收日器材船隻時，在日點交淸册中，未將此十二艘機器帆船列入點交，至十一月間始有人向查緝組密報，但該密報之機船，僅知有五艘，其藏匿處在楊樹浦復興島附近。查緝組當派員前往調查緝獲，並根據此綫索，又查出七艘，總計十二艘。據日方稱，此項帆船原爲日商所有，於戰時由日海軍徴用，投降後，此十二艘機船即發還原有日商，故未列入淸岫點交我方。然查此爲日方之飾詞。國逃避共隱匿船隻之罪，蓋即爲日商所有，此爲交通工具，亦當點交我方接管也。據悉，此十二艘機器帆船，頃已由查緝組移交招商局接管。</p>
<p>隱藏房屋續被查出</p>
<p>（二）日人楠堅將其所置之南市中華路一五〇二號至一五一〇號（均係雙號）房屋五幢，於日投降後，恐被沒收，故委托其華籍汽車夫出面保管。頃據密報，及該屋各住戶之證明，此項產業確係日人所有，故已由查緝組沒收，將交中央信託局處理。（三）日商三菱公司華買辦鄧瑞芝，隱藏三菱公司所有之銅元十一箱，於舊歷年底時為查緝組在百老匯路百祿坊十號鄧之家中查獲，此外該組又繼續查獲偽江蘇煙酒稅局局長董逆修甲之私產房屋若干幢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國善後救濟總署中國分署署長奧爾姆史坦中校，於昨日下午三時，假江西路都城飯店，招待本市新聞界。出席者該署高級職員，及各報社記者四五十人。當由奧氏報吿分署最近業務要點計三項：一爲</p>
<p>治理黃河</p>
<p>計劃，據稱該項計劃，現正積極推進，俾望全部計劃可於本年度內完成。據調查所得，黃河沿岸損毀情形較嚴重者，即河南鄭州附近長的三里之決口。據聯總署治黃計劃總工程師陶德氏佔計，此決口可望於本年七月修竣陶氏新近方視察黃河災情返來，據吿沿岸其他損毀情形，尙不致如傳說中之嚴重。現擬將堤築高一尺至二尺。至於治黃所需之器械材料等，二週前曾裝滿列車十七節輸往該區，現尙擬繼續申請補充。奧氏對治黃計劃前途，頗表樂觀。迄目前爲止，治黃工程已僱用之人員，達二萬左右，在美因購買器材之支出，已達美金三百萬元。二爲整理</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路</p>
<p>據聯總署上海分署委員杜　氏，視察沿綫經過稱：全綫涵洞橋樑，被炸毀者達一百餘處。現雖暫加修理，惟不堪久用。故決以軍中所用之渡橋，趕築新橋樑。車輛方面，現已購就新車頭二十個，車廂三千六百節，聯總署方面刻正考慮再添購新車頭一百八十一個，以便運華供用。三爲疏暢</p>
<p>水路運輸</p>
<p>奧氏稱，行總署及聯總署成認爲運輸問題不能解決，善後救濟工作均將無法進行。故行總署對改進水運，備見努力。聯總署方面，刻在華盛頓成立一使節團，由該總署處理組負責人史璜生氏任領隊，赴菲律賓視察該地船隻剩餘情形。按照計劃，將有拖駁一批撥交中國應用，其中有登陸用船隻一百四十艘，即將駛運來華，供長江上運輸急用。該項船隻多裝置高速度柴油機械，駕駛時不無困難，惟望能於三個月中，設法使國人自行駕馭。奧氏又稱：照預定計劃，將有</p>
<p>運貨汽車</p>
<p>一萬輛運華，由行總署分配全國公路駛用。現初步進行極爲良好，當可詛將該項計劃推行盡利。奧氏末稱：亟望聯總署現存上海之器材物料，能早日配發各處應用，以便再向總署申請補充云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Resuming Traffic Still Under Negotiation, Road Repair Work Awaits Commencement, North China Expected to Reopen to Traffic Within Three Months <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping, February 6th) Regarding the issue of restoring transportation, the two sides' opinions remain far apart. However, with the success of the negotiation conference, this localized problem is unlikely to escalate into a completely irresolvable serious situation. It is understood that the government believes that transportation must maintain the traditional unity of the past and not be fragmented, while the CCP insists on its principles of railway neutralization and democratization, and puts forward specific requirements: (1) The CCP should send troops to participate in the management of railways north of the Yellow River and increase the number of railway police. (2) The CCP shall manage the railways in the CCP-controlled areas by itself. There is no sign of convergence between these vastly different views. It is said that the American personnel have indicated that the CCP should withdraw its demands. Ye Jianying originally planned to return to Yan'an for instructions, but due to the need to discuss a general outline for the transportation issue, the plan has been temporarily postponed. According to sources in the transportation sector, all routes have been calm this past week, with only minor damage to the Longhai and Tongpu lines. The repair teams and work crews dispatched from Beiping have arrived at the starting points of each line to be repaired, such as Yuanshi, Botou, and Qinglongqiao. However, the Communist army has not yet approved the start of construction, citing that no orders have been received. The special commissioner of the Ministry of Transportation in North China will fly with American expert Hill on the Jinpu Line on the 6th to inspect the damage along various sections from low altitude, in preparation for the restoration. It is heard that the government's estimated cost for repairing the railways in North China is about 10 billion, and the required rails are planned to be temporarily diverted from the rails of the Shide Road, the Qiancun section, and the sidings between Shanhai Pass and Huanggu Tun on the Beining line.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6th) The eagerly awaited issue of restoring transportation throughout the country is impossible to begin immediately because the side issues that arose during the armistice agreements in various regions have not yet been resolved. According to a guest from the northern section of the Jinpu Railway today, the engineering and repair teams that had already arrived at their designated locations received a notice from the Communist army four days ago to postpone road repairs. Before the gradual realization of ceasefire and road restoration, the Communist army's military deployments must be completed in another posture. The Communist army is currently making major adjustments, and once its adjustments are completed, the road restoration issue can be agreed upon and proceed smoothly. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6th) News from the transportation sector: After a long period of destruction, the loss of steel rails on major railways has reached nearly 600 kilometers, and the loss of sleepers is estimated at about 1.2 million. The repair of steel rails is being carried out as an emergency measure, dismantling and diverting rails from various branch lines and minor tracks for repair, but this can only barely make up 500 kilometers, and the remaining amount will require a great deal of thought. Sleepers are currently being purchased from various provinces. It is heard that a large number of steel rails are still hidden in the Taihang Mountains, which were transported by carrying them 30 li per day in the past. If they have not been moved for other purposes, returning them in good faith and carrying them down the mountain will undoubtedly take a considerable amount of time. The person who spoke of this was a young engineer bearing the heavy responsibility of road repair, and tears welled up in his eyes before he could finish speaking.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, February 6th) Transportation Vice Minister Ling Hongxun stated that the provincial governments are very enthusiastic about purchasing sleepers and collecting civilian labor for road repairs. All routes have prepared restoration plans, and the first batch of repair funds has also been distributed. The engineering and repair teams organized by each route have already arrived at the locations to be repaired, but after repeated negotiations, work has not yet begun. The executive groups of the Executive Headquarters are currently traveling back and forth between the North and South, and it is hoped that results will be achieved soon, so that the various routes in North China can be repaired and open to traffic in two or three months.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping, February 6th) According to well-informed sources: Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai will soon go to Xuzhou for inspection.</p>
<p>(United Press, Chongqing, February 6th) It was learned tonight that U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall, Minister of Political Affairs of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission Zhang Zhizhong, and Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai will depart around February 15th for a two-week inspection tour of various parts of China.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, February 6th) Major General Belodeau, leader of the executive group of the Military Mediation Executive Department, arrived in Chongqing from Beiping and met with General Marshall this afternoon to report on the work of the executive group.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping, February 5th) Currently, the Mediation Executive Department has distributed its peace groups to various provinces and regions, with a total of 14 groups dispatched, including nine larger central groups: (1) Jining Group, dispatched on January 17th, leader Lin Guangjiong. (2) Jinan Group, dispatched on January 17th, leader Tu Xuwu. (3) Xuzhou Group, dispatched on January 17th, leader Li Shuzheng. (4) Guangshan Group, dispatched on January 20th, leader Deng Weiren. (5) Guangzhou Group, dispatched on January 22nd, leader Huang Weiqin. (6) Xinxiang Group, dispatched on January 29th, leader Zeng Letao. (7) Chengde Group, dispatched on January 31st, leader Yue Changjiang. (8) Taiyuan Group, dispatched on January 31st, leader Zou Lufu. (9) Shijiazhuang Group, dispatched today, leader Zhu Yuenuan. There are five secondary groups dispatched: (1) Chifeng Group, dispatched on January 17th, leader Wei Pei. (2) Zhangjiakou Group, dispatched on January 19th, leader Guo Ya. (3) Group, dispatched on January 19th, leader Tang Tianhe. (4) Houma Group, dispatched on January 31st, leader Shen Guofu. (5) Dezhou Group, dispatched on January 22nd, leader Liu Jinming. Sixteen reporters accompanied each group's supply plane to various places for inspection.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping, February 5th) The mediation work in Chifeng is still ongoing, and the issue of the withdrawal of the Chifeng Security Team remains to be resolved by the Executive Department. The Executive Department group in the area has temporarily ordered the number of security team members to remain at the level of January 23rd and for any subsequent increases to be withdrawn immediately. It is hoped that both sides will remove their guards so that the people know that peace has truly arrived. According to the group's report, the local security team is reorganized from the 67th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade, the 14th Regiment of the 26th Brigade, and the 66th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Communist Army.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, February 6th) The government representative of the Military Mediation Executive Department's Shijiazhuang Group, Major General Hu Pinghan, the American representative, Colonel Grape, and the Communist Army representative, Xu Decao, and ten others arrived in Shijiazhuang by plane from Beiping on the morning of the 5th. The group's area of responsibility is the region 50 to 75 kilometers around Shijiazhuang. After completing their work in Shijiazhuang, they will go to Yuanshi for inspection and may send subgroups to various places as necessary to conduct detailed investigations.</p>

<p>To this day, foreigners' understanding of China is still stuck in the "queue era." Some foreign old ladies ask rapid-fire questions that are often impossible to answer. Do your parents still sell their daughters? Do couples still marry without knowing each other? Do women still bind their feet? In fact, I myself can refute all these questions. However, the deeply ingrained ideas of thousands of years cannot immediately give way to the changes that have occurred in the past thirty years. My appearance cannot answer their questions, so they feel bewildered.</p>
<p>In general, foreigners know that the Chinese man is Chairman Chiang and the woman is Madame Chiang. The remaining 450 million are all good-hearted farmers struggling under natural and man-made disasters in Pearl S. Buck's novels. The French address women, whether married or not, as Madame. At the International Women's Conference in Paris last December, we had a representative named Jiang sitting on the podium. An old Finnish lady next to me pointed and told me that she knew Madame Chiang had two sisters. I shook my head and said that we had just met and I didn't know her family situation. She widened her eyes and said, "You don't even know Madame Chiang's family history?" Chiang and Jiang are spelled the same in English, so she was convinced that the person sitting on the stage was Madame Chiang and paid her respects to me for a long time. In order to avoid misunderstanding, I obediently brought out the surname I never used, and the next day I transformed into Madame Lu.</p>
<p>As far as foreigners know, Chinese women are oppressed by men and confined to the kitchen. They vaguely remember that Empress Dowager Cixi once appeared on the late Qing political stage. Another shadow of a Chinese woman is Wang Baochuan—the Wang Baochuan on the British stage in Hsiung Shih-i's play. Thanks to Mrs. Cripps, whose China Aid Association recently printed a booklet called "Chinese Women," preparing to introduce Chinese heroines to Britain. In that booklet, the famous Mr. Lü Fengzi became the representative of Chinese female painters, with a photo attached. His name and his artistic style of long hair caused him to transform from a male painter to a female painter in Britain.</p>
<p>China is a large and resource-rich country, which is generally known to the world, but few people know to what extent it is large and abundant. A female clerk at the telegraph office, holding the telegram I sent to Nanjing, didn't know where Nanjing was. When I told her that Nanjing was the capital of China, she insisted that only Chongqing was the capital of China, as if she knew more about Chinese geography than I did.</p>
<p>When foreigners print maps of China, they like to put the titles China, Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Manchuria on them, so everyone has a false impression that Tibet, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Northeast are all self-contained entities. One foreigner was surprised to hear that the Northeast dialect is much closer to Mandarin than Cantonese. For ten years, he had always thought that the Northeast had some strange language and writing of its own.</p>
<p>The famous Chinese products known to foreigners are porcelain, tea (but they still don't know that Chinese people don't add sugar or milk when drinking tea), and embroidery. They can't appreciate Chinese calligraphy and painting. They think that Chinese people always paint when they pick up a brush, not write. Therefore, after the San Francisco conference, when Chinese representatives signed their names with a brush, all the London newspapers reported that the Chinese representatives painted their names in ancient Chinese characters, as if they had signed their names in Great Seal Script or Lesser Seal Script.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchao, the representative of the Ministry of Propaganda stationed in Britain, had a ruyi (a ceremonial scepter) that his ancestor Ye Mingchen had been given by the emperor repaired. After the repair was completed, the shopkeeper very politely said, "Dr. Yeh, here is your walking stick."</p>
<p>This series of comical facts are all caused by misunderstandings due to differences in Eastern and Western languages, writing systems, and customs. To eliminate these misunderstandings, we must understand each other. To understand each other, we must provide accurate information for people to understand us. In the Burma campaign, everyone was vying for credit. In Hollywood's "Battle of Burma," Errol Flynn appeared as an American hero, obliterating the British. Britain banned the film from meeting British audiences and rushed to produce "The Great Victory in Burma" with the British army as the center. Our Chinese Expeditionary Force once saved 5,000 besieged British troops and fought desperately in the wilderness of northern Burma, but they remained unknown.</p>
<p>R.H. Scott, the former Far East representative of the British intelligence department, wrote an article praising the Chinese in Malaya after returning from a prisoner-of-war camp in Singapore. They helped the British pass information, transport food, and made great contributions. However, in the international arena, if it hadn't been for Scott's quick pen, they would still be unsung heroes.</p>
<p>We want people to understand our culture, our politics, our society, and our lives. When East and West meet, we shouldn't just teach the West to come over, but the East should also go to meet them. Our victories in the war, except for the Battle of Taierzhuang, were all unknown. Some foreigners have never even heard of the Three Victories of Changsha.</p>
<p>Some foreign newspapers and foreigners believe that the Chinese Communist Party has a way to improve Chinese agricultural society because they advocate rent reduction and advocate dividing land to tenant farmers. The government's rent reduction policy, the policy of supporting tenant farmers and the principle of "land to the tiller" in the Three Principles of the People, are almost unknown to foreigners. Foreigners are even more confused by the political tutelage currently implemented by the Kuomintang. What exactly is political tutelage!</p>
<p>Yes, we need explanatory information for reference on policies, decrees, and construction. How can we blame people for misunderstanding, how can we blame people for misinterpreting—when we ourselves remain silent?</p>
<p>Westerners are truly eager to understand the East, absorbing all information about the East, even if it is wrong. Why don't we stand up and express ourselves! We cannot allow a few unscrupulous overseas Chinese to represent China, we cannot allow the so-called China problem experts who treat China as a semi-colony to mislead public opinion in their countries, we cannot allow some foreign correspondents stationed in China to telegraph back home and think it strange that Chinese generals working in Shanghai don't understand English. No, we cannot let all this continue.</p>
<p>Understanding between countries can eliminate war. Small misunderstandings can reflect large misunderstandings. The Times still calls Wang Buwei Dr. Shih Chieh, and still places Gui Sui in Rehe Province. There are too many places where we need to speak up!</p>
<p>Why don't we speak up? Why do we speak up so little? So cautiously? So hesitantly? Why do we let distorted interpretations exist abroad? Implicit reservation is not a way to express oneself. In the international arena, silence does not seem to be the best language. (Posted on January 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Issue of the Soviet Withdrawal from the Northeast, Both Sides Are Currently Negotiating, Minister Wu Replied to Reporter Inquiries Yesterday <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(United Press, Chongqing, February 6th) Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen replied to reporters today that China is currently negotiating with the Soviet Union regarding the issue of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast. The deadline for the completion of the withdrawal is stipulated as February 1st. The Soviet Union has not formally requested an extension, and China has not requested an extension either. The Soviet army's delay in withdrawing is probably due to transportation difficulties.</p>
<p>(United Press, Beiping, February 6th) Articles published in two Beiping newspapers today indicate that the Soviet army may not be able to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast before spring. "The World Daily" reported that the contracts signed by coal merchants and food wholesalers in the Northeast with the Soviet army, which were due to expire at the end of January, have been renewed until the end of May. This indicates that the Soviet plan does not intend to implement the withdrawal from the Northeast in the next four months.</p>
<h3 id="e8">US House Naval Committee Passes Bill to Help China Build its Navy, Transferring Warships and Sending an Advisory Group to China <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Washington, February 5th) The U.S. House Naval Committee today unanimously passed the government's proposal to supply China with warships and a naval advisory group. The committee also approved two amendments, allowing the President to be authorized by Congress to supply China with any surplus battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers (excluding escort destroyers) or submarines. The committee also authorized the President to transfer to China the materials needed to operate and maintain the aforementioned ships and train the personnel on board, including ammunition, parts, machinery in repair shops, and all items necessary to maintain and operate these ships. Naval Committee Chairman Vinson hopes that the committee's final recommendation will be quickly approved by the House in the next few days. The ships in this recommendation are divided into three categories: (1) Battleships and other ships that require authorization from Congress for transfer. (2) Naval small ships, floating docks, etc., that do not require authorization from Congress for transfer. (3) Materials necessary for maintaining various ships. The second part of the recommendation, sending a naval advisory group, will stay in our country for five years. In the initial stage, the United States, according to the contract, will have 100 naval officers and 200 enlisted naval soldiers. It is said that the U.S. Navy is vigorously advocating aiding the Chinese Navy with ships and advisors. Rear Admiral Cardner, representing Fleet Admiral Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations, stated that the aid to China with ships and advisors is in full compliance with President Truman's statement on U.S. policy toward China, in which the President stated, "As China moves toward the path of peaceful nations, the United States is prepared to assist in building its military system, which can fulfill China's responsibility to maintain peace and order for its own country and for the international community." Cardner said that training Chinese naval personnel and providing them with landing craft will enable China to assist in removing the Japanese from the Asian continent. The government's proposal to assist China with ships and advisors was first initiated by Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, approved by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and revised by House Naval Committee Chairman Vinson. The Vinson bill passed yesterday did not mention the word "surplus," so the Naval Committee revised the wording of the bill today, stipulating that most of the ships transferred to China must be surplus ships.</p>
<p>(US News Service, Washington, February 6th) The U.S. House Naval Committee unanimously passed a resolution on the 5th, authorizing the President to transfer surplus naval warships to China. The purpose of the resolution is to assist the Republic of China in expanding and maintaining its naval establishment and for other uses. After the bill is passed by the House Naval Committee, it will be voted on by the entire House of Representatives. If it is passed, it will be submitted to the Senate. If it is passed by both houses of Congress, the bill will be sent to the President for signature before it takes effect.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, this city) Amidst the start of the U.S. military's demobilization in China, the U.S. military advisory group, which is expected to be established soon, is gradually showing signs of its organizational structure. Although the U.S. military department has not officially announced the advisors who will help us train the army, navy, and air force, it is learned that General Wedemeyer will serve as the temporary leader, with General McClure, the former commander of the U.S. combat command, responsible for the army, and General Randall, the current commander of the U.S. military in Chongqing, responsible for the air force. The people in charge of the navy and air force are currently in China. General McClure returned to the U.S. last year to report for duty and may arrive in China soon. According to U.S. official sources, the U.S. military advisory group will be formally established around May or June of this year. The staff of this group will be U.S. military personnel who volunteer to participate.</p>

<h3 id="e18">CCP to Hold Central Committee Meeting to Discuss Demobilization and Other Issues; Communist Army to be Reduced to Twenty Divisions by April <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 6th] A CCP spokesperson announced today that the party will hold a plenary session of the Central Committee at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to discuss the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. In addition to party affairs issues such as relocating the party headquarters to a location closer to the central government and expanding party membership, the Central Committee plenary session will also discuss three urgent issues: (1) the restoration of transportation in the liberated areas, (2) the demobilization of the Communist army, and (3) relief and rehabilitation. The Central Committee will also decide whether to convene a National Party Congress to discuss recent events within and outside the party. The three main issues have already begun to be resolved. The restoration of transportation is currently being handled by the Peiping Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, but the CCP still has some reservations, including its demand to participate in the railway management and railway police authority in North China. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army will be reduced to twenty divisions within four months in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the surplus troops will be converted into militia and local security forces. The Political Department and all military-related activities of the CCP will be abolished. Relief and rehabilitation work is most difficult due to the extreme poverty in the border areas and requires external assistance. It is reported that UNRRA will transport 1,000 tons of relief goods and 500 trucks to Yantai within days. After the implementation of democracy throughout the country, the border area governments will be abolished, and new provincial governments will be organized in accordance with the new constitution. Regarding the expansion of party membership, the CCP plans to lower the qualifications for joining the party in order to absorb new members. The party headquarters will be moved to the capital, and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders will move to Nanjing for a long stay, but these matters have not yet been decided. The Central Committee is the highest organ of the CCP, with a total of forty-four members and thirty-three alternate members. It elects ten people to form the Political Bureau, which exercises its functions during the recess of the Central Committee. The last plenary session of the Central Committee was held in mid-April of last year.</p>

When the Paris radio station suddenly announced that "panic was about to descend," several theaters stopped their shows, and the audience rushed out of the doors, heading to underground buildings and old air-raid shelters. The broadcast spread within the working-class areas, only reaching the city's broadcast wave, so areas outside of Paris were not affected. However, the radio station announced: "We have to suspend the broadcast program because of a sudden atomic bomb attack. Listeners, please listen for instructions," and so on.

<h3 id="e26">Second World War Cost $680 Billion; Four Times That of the First <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Basel, Switzerland, 5th] According to the report of the International Bank for International Settlements here, the cost of the Second World War was more than four times that of the First World War. By last summer, the expenses borne by the national treasuries of various countries around the world amounted to approximately 680 billion U.S. dollars. Converting the value of currency in 1913 to the value of currency in 1945 (due to rising prices), the cost of the First World War was approximately 180 billion U.S. dollars. The above figures are only direct war expenses; other costs such as the loss of life, property damage, reduced production, war relief expenses, and losses suffered by neutral countries are not included.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Unprecedented Global Food Crisis in Modern History; Director-General of UNRRA Issues Appeal; US President Convenes Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Relief Measures <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Reuters] The Director-General of UNRRA, Lehman, reported in writing this evening on the dangerous situation caused by the acute shortage of wheat and other food grains in various recovered countries. According to him, this is the greatest crisis facing the allied countries since the end of the war. The number of men, women, and children suffering from famine in Europe and the Far East this winter exceeds that of any period in modern history. Lehman also stated that UNRRA's total requirement for food grains in January was 700,000 tons, but only 40,000 tons were shipped. Judging from the current situation, the amount may be even smaller in February. Lehman also said that he will continue to consult with the authorities in the United States, Canada, and Australia on this matter. According to the United States Information Agency, Washington, 5th, Lehman stated that the countries assisted by UNRRA that need grain relief can be divided into three groups: (1) Albania, Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, whose need for grain is extremely urgent because the drought in the Mediterranean region has only produced half of the normal harvest in the past season. (2) China can only be supplied with a small amount of rice by the supplying countries, thus further increasing the need for wheat. (3) Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland have been disappointed in production in the past year due to the war's effects, fertilizer shortages, and lack of agricultural implements. Lehman said, "I have informed the governments of all the awaiting assistance countries of the situation and asked them to do everything possible to utilize their imported and domestically produced grain resources to ensure that the limited relief grains can be shared equally."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman held a one-hour cabinet meeting today to discuss measures for wheat and other food relief because of the severe food crisis in the liberated countries of Europe.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong will not return to Chongqing for a short period after arriving in Nanjing. Vice Minister Hang Ding... This morning, Vice Minister Zhu gave his impressions of this trip, saying briefly: The primary purpose of education today is to seek stability. Everyone is now talking about democracy and freedom, but democracy and freedom must be built on the spirit of the rule of law, otherwise democracy and freedom cannot be solid. Education must train students to develop a spirit of the rule of law, and that is the purpose. The Ministry of Education is facing a major problem today, which is how to enable students in the rear and students in the recovered areas to get along peacefully. Looking at the current situation, it is extremely worrying. The Ministry of Education has spent a lot of effort on reconciling the abnormal feelings of the students in the recovered areas and the underlying "superiority complex" of the students in the rear, but there have been few practical results. The current situation of Nanjing Provisional University urgently needs to be improved. Vice Minister Zhu deeply felt that China's education and science are currently lagging behind, and said that more efforts are needed.</p>

<p>The Bao Gou V-Team also has a solid strength basketball league. Yesterday, the game was originally not very tense, but unexpectedly, the two games in Divisions A1 and A2 were fiercely contested. Liangxi narrowly beat the Shantou team, and Desheng also narrowly won the V-Team in a very dangerous situation. In the women's group, the V-Team easily defeated Qianghua. The simple situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>In the women's group, the V-Team won the first quarter 10-4. The situation remained the same in the second quarter. The result was 17-10, with the V-Team taking the lead. In the third quarter, Qianghua didn't get anything, and the V-Team scored six points. In the last quarter, each scored two goals. The final result was 27-14, and the V-Team defeated Qianghua.</p>
<p>Following that, the general victory of the A2 Division, the V-Team, started a battle. After the start, Desheng took the lead all the way, once taking an absolute advantage with 17-6. Unexpectedly, the V-Team suddenly became active at this time. Chen Chengji and Zhu Mingxing were all accurate, and they won the first half with 23-20. In the second half, the V-Team was initially able to maintain the status quo, taking the lead with 31-24. Desheng had no choice but to call a timeout. As expected, they gained momentum. Tao Shaosheng and Zou Ziren were the most handy, and they finally defeated the V-Team with 39-35.</p>
<p>In the final game of Division A1, the Shantou team and the Liangxi team fought. At first, it was thought that the Shantou team could win, but Liangxi was very invigorated yesterday. Zhang Shaoqing and Tao Yingshi were quite good at darting. The score in the first half was 21-18, with the Shantou team leading by only one and a half goals. In the second half, Liangxi became more and more powerful, and had surpassed the Shantou team twice with 26-22 and 28-26. The Shantou team quickly caught up. Lin Weicong, Chen Qingjiang and Ma Canxi tried their best to prevent a surprise upset. How dangerous! The score was Shantou 39, Liangxi 36. The score in the second half was not divided.</p>
<p>In addition, the game between Hualian and Jiangwan Air Force in Division A1 on Friday was postponed because the Jiangwan Air Force had another league and could not spare the time. The Basketball Federation allowed the postponement, so there will only be two games left on Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Mission of Northwestern University <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fuhua</p>
<p>Northwestern University, which has a history of more than six years, was formerly known as Beijing Normal University and Beijing University. Although it was born for a short time, it has a very glorious tradition.</p>
<p>It is located in Chenggu, Shaanxi, and has cultivated many talents for the vast Northwest, promoted the development of education in the Northwest, and made Chenggu a cultural center.</p>
<p>The call for developing the Northwest had already resounded to the skies before the war. Today, at the beginning of the victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the establishment of the country, the importance of the Northwest has become even greater. How to consolidate the border defense? How to build the Northwest? This arduous mission undoubtedly needs Northwestern University to bear. Therefore, domestic intellectuals attach great importance to it and place great hopes on it.</p>
<p>President Liu Jihong</p>
<p>The current president, Liu Jihong, has a passion for education. He served as the president of Henan University for four years and achieved remarkable results. Since becoming the president of Northwestern University the year before last, he has hired more professors and expanded facilities, and has actively reorganized the school affairs, and everything has been renewed. His policy is to seek progress in stability, so that all aspects of the school can be improved day by day.</p>
<p>All major matters in the school are decided by the school affairs meeting. The meeting is presided over by the president, and the deans of each college, the heads of departments, and the representatives of the professors all attend and participate. At the meeting, everyone expresses their opinions freely, discusses them, and then implements them according to the plan without any changes.</p>
<p>Northwestern University attaches importance to administrative efficiency and pays great attention to the evaluation of staff. The office staff of each office work hard and on time, so the handling of all matters is very fast and accurate, and everything is in order.</p>
<p>Three Colleges in the Whole School</p>
<p>At present, the whole school is divided into three colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law and Commerce, including Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Border Politics, Education, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and Geography, Law, Political Science, Economics, and Commerce.</p>
<p>The departments of Chinese and Foreign Languages, Geology and Geography, and Law are further divided into groups such as English, Russian, Geology, Geography, Jurisprudence, and Justice, totaling seventeen departments and groups, and the scale is becoming larger and larger. This semester, Chinese, Russian, German, Japanese, Uyghur, and Tibetan will be added. In the future, after moving to Xi'an, it is also planned to add needed colleges and departments.</p>
<p>The teaching staff is quite complete. The professors of each department used to lecture at Normal University and Peking University, and their writings are rich and well-known at home and abroad. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they began to take refuge in the south. In recent years, new experts have been hired from all over the world. Among the current 100 professors in the school, more than half have served for ten years, and some have been teaching for more than 25 years. They have the spirit of being poor but happy, and they are dedicated to teaching. They can concentrate on teaching without easily moving. In the current situation of lack of teachers, it is really difficult to have such a foundation.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Books</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, the old books and instruments of Normal University and Peking University were not brought out, which is very insufficient. However, in recent years, they have been continuously added from home and abroad, and they have been slightly replenished. There are currently tens of thousands of Chinese and Western books and magazines, and thousands of specimens, instruments and medicines. There is also a considerable quantity of items that have been ordered and are still on the way. In addition, there are more than 1,000 pieces of cultural relics from various provinces in the Northwest, including drawings of buildings of past dynasties, sketches of patterns, rubbings of inscriptions on steles and statues, photos of carvings, murals, historical sites and folk customs, and general antiques. They are rich in collection and valuable. Therefore, ordinary experiments and necessary references can be used slightly.</p>
<p>More than a Thousand Students</p>
<p>There are more than 1,000 students in the school, coming from 25 provinces and cities. Among them, the most are from Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong.</p>
<p>The research atmosphere is very strong: the library and periodical reading room are always full; professors often hold academic lectures, and the audience is enthusiastic and full; various academic societies and societies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and special issues are published on every anniversary, which are full of beautiful things.</p>
<p>The permanent school site has long been set as Xi'an, and the Ministry of Education has allocated the old site of Northeastern University for the school building, which is now actively preparing for the reception and repairs, and it has been decided to start moving north in early May. All the faculty and students feel excited and hope that after moving to Xi'an, all construction can be completed quickly according to the planned plan, and a new page will be opened in the history of education in the new China. (Sent from Chenggu on January 26, 1946)</p>

<h3 id="e45">240 Kilometers of Travel in the Snow: A Scene of Harbin: Compatriots in the Northeast Say: In the past fourteen years, it was like climbing a high mountain, and now we have finally climbed the last step: Central News Agency reporter Zhong Henian sent from Harbin <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>At 2:20 PM on December 26th, goose-feather snowflakes were flying in Changchun. A group of 27 people from the Harbin Municipal Government reception staff set off for Harbin by car. This is the first step in the reception work in northern Northeast China, and it should be considered a major event. In a hurry, the reporter left Changchun lightly and accompanied them on their journey.</p>
<p>Changchun to Harbin is 242 kilometers. The scenery along the line is naturally the most interesting object for people who have wanted to see it for fourteen years but have not been able to. Unfortunately, the curtain of night had already fallen on the 26th. On the entire Changchun-Harbin line, only a section of the road north of Changchun was seen. However, after six days, Zhang Jiaao returned from Harbin to Changchun, and the reporter returned south by car, saying goodbye to Harbin in the morning mist. This time, I not only saw the various scenes shrouded in the dark night sky last time, but also relived the wilderness seen last time in the south. Everywhere was a piece of white, and staring intently, everything, even a group of cattle and horses scattered on the snow, or a small tree far away on the horizon, felt particularly eye-catching.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Looking at the Changchun-Harbin Line, We See the Japanese's Sinister Intentions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The villages are denser near the stations in the Harbin area. The food bags piled at the station can be seen at one station and then at another. The time when food was abundant is clearly displayed before our eyes. The "village" is certainly not as impressive and great as imagined, with roof tiles connected to the walls, but compared to the farmhouses seen at the stations in the Changchun area, which are sparse, low and simple, presenting a desolate scene, it is indeed much better. Northeasterners often say that when Japan ruled the Northeast, it wanted to make the north and south disparity: "South Manchuria" had no food to eat, and "North Manchuria" had no clothes to wear. After passing through the entire Changchun-Harbin line, we can see the sinister intentions of the Japanese.</p>
<p>When the car left Changchun, factory buildings could be seen within half an hour or so. The tall chimneys stood tall in the clouds, but there was no lingering green smoke, which made people feel lonely and desolate.</p>
<p>The palace-style station in Shuangchengzi is still the same, although the color is a bit gray, it has not lost its original shape. And many of the station names along the line have been changed by the Japanese invaders. For example, the well-known "Yaomen" is now called "Dehui".</p>

<p>The car arrived in Harbin at 10:30 PM on the 26th.</p>
<p>When the night curtain opened during the journey, the companions in the car all felt a little tired. At this time, the car climbed the bridge over the famous Songhua River, and one of the companions hummed the song "My Home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China", and the past was full of memories. We have the pain of not being able to return home in the past, and we should cherish our present.</p>
<p>At 10:30 PM in Harbin, the streets were already silent, and the lives of the citizens were the same as in Changchun.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Harbin's Flying Snow Shows Beauty in Greatness <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Among the cities in our country, Harbin is one of the most beautiful cities. Old Harbin people would say that when the Northeast is covered in snow in winter, Harbin can only be said to be "great". Everywhere is white, and the roofs of Russian-style buildings, the tall spires on the Lama platform, and the bare branches are all covered in snow, and only greatness can be shown in the simplicity. However, the reporter said that the characteristic of beauty cannot be concealed in greatness. When walking in Nangang or the Chinese Street here, the European style will appear in your mind, and even in some places it will remind you of Shanghai, in Daowai it reminds you of Tianjin, and the Daguan Garden area naturally reminds you of the Tianqiao in Beijing. On the famous Songhua River, there is a vast expanse, and the Songhua River Railway Bridge to Manzhouli spans the river. Sleds—locally called harrows—gallop below, making people feel infinitely affectionate. A special kind of beauty. The girls wear brightly colored scarves on their heads, covering their necks, and a bunch of hair is puffed up high on their foreheads. Snowflakes stay on it, whether it is a blonde foreign girl or a black-haired Chinese lady, setting off her rosy cheeks, making them look healthier and more charming.</p>
<h3 id="e49">With No Wind, The Renowned Establishments Experience Extremely Quiet Business <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Seventy to eighty percent of the shops have resumed business. The famous Churin Department Store and Victoria Hotel are experiencing a large number of customers every day. Especially in the days leading up to the New Year, many overseas residents were eagerly buying New Year's goods. After paying and collecting the goods, the procedures took almost a quarter of an hour of waiting. Harbin's dance scene is well-known, but although there are several dance halls now, business is very slow. The once-renowned Mardil Hotel is still a military camp. Even so, it shows Harbin's prosperity, with a unique flair compared to Changchun's commercial and political center.</p>
<p>Besides foreign businessmen speaking Chinese in Harbin, there are also many people from Shandong and Hebei. In Daoli district, the Shandong community has the upper hand, while in Daowai district, the Hebei community is dominant. More than twenty nationalities of foreigners reside in Harbin. According to a survey in 1943, there were nine Americans and thirty-three British. However, in recent years, their numbers have dwindled. It is said that there are no Americans left, and only two elderly spinsters remain in Harbin. In addition to cultural and educational circles, Harbin women's occupations also include so-called geishas, etc.</p>
<p>Because there are many foreigners in Harbin, Harbin people have relatively strong language skills. It is common for a person to speak two or three languages. For example, currently, the long-distance telephone line between Harbin and Changchun on the China Changchun Railway Bureau is the only line working. To communicate, one must use either Russian or Japanese; otherwise, conversation is impossible. Harbin people tell a joke: wealthy people all want a Japanese maid and a White Russian chauffeur at home, because without them, wealth is not truly enjoyed.</p>
<p>Currently, there is an educational issue in the Northeast that urgently needs attention: the "Kyowa language" (Japanese influenced Chinese) has become deeply entrenched. For example, "photography" is called "Shashin," and "broadcasting" is called "Hoso." Originally, these terms were also used in the North China region, but not as commonly as in the Northeast. Some articles from the Northeast are difficult to understand. However, Harbin is slightly better; the local newspapers use much less "Kyowa language" than those in Changchun.</p>

<p>The people of the Northeast are generally lovable. After enduring fourteen years of enslaved life, their fervent love for the motherland and their strong sense of national unity are beyond the journalist's pen to describe. The enthusiastic cheers of the citizens for Mayor Yang Chuo'an in front of the Harbin Municipal Government after the reception on New Year's Day need not be repeated here. The journalist will record a passage from a conversation with Zhang Shixiu, the elderly principal of Harbin Jingwei Elementary School, during a visit on the 28th, to show a glimpse of the psychological state of the people of the Northeast in recent months, and to conclude this article: "The day we had longed for for fourteen years has finally arrived. Who knew that from 'August 15th' (Japanese Surrender) until now, almost four months have passed before we saw the arrival of the Central Government's receiving personnel. These four months have been truly difficult to endure, like climbing a high mountain for the past fourteen years. 'August 15th' arrived, meaning we were almost at the summit, only one step away. But this final step, we desperately couldn't climb it, struggling to endure, struggling to endure, struggling to endure until now."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he lowered his breath, his eyes looking at the ground. When he finished the last sentence and raised his gaze, meeting the journalist's eyes, the expression on his face truly revealed that he had reached the summit.</p>

<p>The Political Consultative Conference established the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and restore transportation. The department dispatched groups to various locations to mediate. The importance of their mission is recognized by all parties, and the resolution of the issue depends on the work of the executive groups. The group sent to Shandong consisted of U.S. representative Colonel 克 (Ke), Government representative Colonel Tu Xuwu, Communist Party representative Colonel Chen Shuliang, U.S. Communications Officer Lieutenant Haley, and members Wang Qi and Communist Party Captain Ma Jinqiao, totaling twelve people. They arrived in Jinan on a special plane on the 18th, and were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. They went to Tai'an on the 19th, returned to Jinan on the 20th, went to Zhangdian on the 21st, returned to Jinan on the 23rd, went to Tai'an again on the 24th, returned to Jinan on the 25th, and flew to Yanzhou on a special plane that day, returning on the 27th, and returning to Peiping on the 28th to report back. Colonel 克 and his party traveled back and forth to various locations in Shandong for ten days, tirelessly traversing the skies and land, enduring hardship. However, their efforts ultimately eased the tense situation in Tai'an, Yanzhou, Zhangdian, Zibo, and other places, and finally, under the principle of the nation first and the party second, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached an understanding and preliminary success. The process of resolving various issues is described below:</p>
<h3 id="e52">Tai'an Turmoil - Pacified After Two Mediations <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>On January 19, at 11:00 AM, Colonel 克 and his party traveled by special train to the Namp'o Railway line to investigate and mediate the Kuomintang-Communist conflict in Tai'an. The Kuomintang and Communist troops were stationed separately between Jinan and Tai'an. Passenger trains ran once a day, and the borders had to be inspected by both sides. From Jinan south to Baimashan, 贾家庄 (Jiajia Zhuang), 炒米店 (Chao Mi Dian), 箇张 (Ge Zhang), 夏靑 (Xia Qing), and 杨树 (Yang Shu) stations, National troops were stationed. Four kilometers south of Qing Yang Shu was the Communist area. South to Wan De Jieshou and all stations to Tai'an were guarded by Communist troops. Although the defense areas were adjacent, there were no conflicts. As the special train passed, the military and civilians gave a grand welcome. The Communist area had not been notified in advance, and was allowed to proceed only after explanation. At 4:30 PM, they arrived at Tai'an Station. Zhao Dusheng, Commissioner of the First Special District of the CCP in Central Shandong, Fang Wei, Magistrate of Tai'an County, and Cheng Yetang, Commander of the garrison regiment, led the military and civilians to welcome them at the station. On the morning of the 20th, representatives from both sides met to discuss solutions to the conflict. The situation in Tai'an was such that the city and the western suburbs were in the hands of the National troops, while the station and the western end of the western suburbs were in the hands of the Communist troops. The two sides were confronting each other in the western suburbs. Although they had stopped firing, the defensive works of both sides were in the middle, less than 100 meters apart, with bayonets facing each other, and the situation remained tense. According to Ning Chunlin and others, the garrison in the city, the station was originally the National troops' defense area. On January 15, the Communist troops took advantage of the opportunity of the Japanese troops heading north to forcibly enter. To comply with the non-combat orders, the station garrison avoided conflict and, after requesting and receiving approval from their superiors, reluctantly withdrew. They requested Zeng Ke氏 (Shi) and others to restore the military status before the ceasefire order on the 13th, and requested the Communist troops to stop the blockade. They were also allowed unarmed soldiers and civilians to purchase supplies inside. The Japanese troops under 洼内 (Wa Nei) of the Dong Taiping Japanese troops were ordered to go to Jinan to surrender their weapons, but were also prevented by the Communist troops from doing so. The Japanese troops should be ordered to go north to comply with the United Nations' regulation of accepting the surrender of Japanese troops. Colonel 克 then proposed seven opinions based on the principle of the nation first and the party second: (1) Immediately stop all military actions and obey the orders of both parties. (Both parties agreed) (2) Immediately stop all actions of destruction, disturbing the people, and theft. (Both parties agreed) (3) Both parties shall jointly guarantee the construction of railways so that transportation is smooth and unobstructed. (At the same time, Mr. 克 explained that when he left Peiping, he received a telegram from Marshal Marshall ordering him to quickly find a way to restore transportation between Jinan and Xuzhou.) (Both parties agreed) (4) People from both sides are free to enter and exit (Both parties agreed) (5) Allow the more than 4,000 Japanese troops currently in Dafenkou and Dong Taiping to concentrate in Jinan to surrender their weapons, and the Communist troops will not stop them. (The CCP stated: If they are unarmed, they can allow them to pass, but armed enemy troops may cause conflict. It was decided to handle this matter after the CCP representatives arrive in Jinan for consultation.) (6) People detained by both parties should be released immediately. (Both parties agreed) (7) Restore the status quo before the effective date of the ceasefire, January 13. (Both parties started arguing again. Mr. 克 then amended the method: The National troops withdrew into the city, the Communist troops withdrew from the station. Neither side will station troops in the station, and the railway police will be responsible. The Communist troops did not agree, and the National troops also stated that they could not abandon the western suburbs. Finally, it was agreed to maintain the current military posture, and both parties would ensure that they would not fire, and remove all defensive obstacles to show peace. The National troops in the city are allowed to go out without weapons to purchase food, and the Communist troops will not prevent them. If any of the above conditions are violated, Mr. 克, etc., will come to deal with them as soon as they receive the news. That night, they returned to Jinan by the original train. On the 21st, Mr. 克 and his party went to Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Railway by special train as scheduled to inspect. As they were working hard, the conflict in Tai'an broke out again. It was not until the afternoon of the 23rd, after returning from Zhangdian, that they took a military heavy vehicle back to Tai'an at 8:00 AM on the 24th. In order to speed up efficiency, they drove straight to Tai'an and started discussions to find an effective way to stop the conflict. No satisfactory result was obtained. At 5:00 PM, Mr. 克 and his party returned to the station and held another meeting with Zhao Dusheng and others. The government representative, Tu Xuwu, and the CCP representative, Chen Shuliang, made sincere guarantees that neither side would fire the first shot. Mr. 克 then asked the CCP side: Because the people in the city lack food, there are 500 bags of flour brought by the special train. Please notify the Communist troops through the CCP representative, Chen Shuliang, to allow the garrison in the city to carry them into the city to alleviate the people's food shortage. The Communist troops agreed to do so, but only unarmed soldiers were allowed. At about 9:00 PM, all of them were transported into the city from the station. Colonel 克 was very excited and pleased by the peaceful sincerity of both parties. At 10:00 PM, the special train left Tai'an, and at 0:30 AM on the 25th, it returned to Jinan, and the turmoil in Tai'an subsided.</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Crisis of Labor Strikes <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: In the past month or two, strikes have occurred frequently in Shanghai, and the trend is intensifying. Initially, the government and public opinion circles inevitably held the principle that the capital should be more tolerant of labor to resolve labor disputes. The capital, because of its capital relations, is unwilling to have too much ill will with labor and would rather suffer losses and settle the matter. Who knew that there were other actors taking the opportunity to step in and agitate in many ways, leading to the most dangerous phenomenon today. It is found that the treatment of workers in major factories now is no less than before August 13 (Battle of Shanghai). If you check the salaries of lower-level officials in various government agencies, they are far less than the wages of workers. Furthermore, apart from those with technical experience, the knowledge, qualifications, and responsibilities of lower-level government officials are far higher than those of factory workers. Is it fair or not? The country is now recovering from an unprecedented disaster and embarking on the road to revitalization and nation-building. Industries and businesses need domestic capitalists and friendly people from all over the world to invest and operate. However, with one strike today and another tomorrow, who dares to invest limited funds in unnecessary consumption? Workers and capital in all factories should work with a sense of shared pain, and then the industry can last and the country can recover its rules. Then, I dare to assert that the number of factories in Shanghai will inevitably decrease day by day, the livelihood of workers in various factories will inevitably become more difficult day by day, and the country will inevitably become poorer day by day. I have traveled to Europe and the United States and have seen that whenever factory workers strike for demands and cannot resume work after mediation by legal institutions, the government has to temporarily take them over, and the army maintains order in the factory and starts work. The most advanced democracy, the United States, often uses this method, and our government can do the same. Our public opinion circles should also focus on the big picture and can no longer make biased arguments, so that industry and commerce can advance without limits, and the country and people will be fortunate.

<p>As early as a month ago, the people of Changchun heard the news that Madame Chiang was coming, and they looked forward to it every day. Women from Harbin, Shenyang, and other places had already sent representatives to Changchun in advance to welcome her. On the 22nd of last month, they were able to see Madame's graceful demeanor in the wind and snow. Welcoming meetings and cheers were everywhere, and some people in the crowd were moved to tears. Figure (1) shows: Madame Chiang's elegance as she works hard in the wind and snow of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e56">Unwilling to Believe it is Happening <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>On the eve of the Spring Festival, the good news of the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference was reported. As President Chiang said in his closing speech, it was "harmonious and coordinated" and "increasingly bright." The day before yesterday, the President met with foreign journalists and said that he would like all parties to cooperate permanently and jointly take responsibility for building the country. Especially in his reply to the Reader's Digest reporter, he recognized that political power is a responsibility rather than a right, and, on behalf of the people of the country, believed that the Communist Party would be able to earnestly implement the "nationalization of the military." This further convinced us that a new page has been turned in Chinese history, with a bright and boundless hope.</p>
<p>Before and during the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, we always advocated that only if all parties came forward with a sincere heart, respecting, trusting, tolerating, and conceding to each other, could China truly embark on the road to democratic politics. Under the call of the people of the whole country "only success is allowed, failure is not allowed," the Political Consultative Conference successfully concluded, which was to some extent due to the appeal of sincerity and trust. Especially on the government side, we can see many bright and tolerant places. For example, on the morning of the opening ceremony, the President resolutely excluded the dispute in the Rehe region, breaking the deadlock of the three-person team and making the cease-fire order finally issued. Before the conference, he solemnly instructed four ways to protect the people's freedom, first creating a good atmosphere for the meeting. During the group discussion, the government also made concessions from time to time and tried its best to show leniency. Expanding the government organization and accommodating people from various parties and social elites to participate together before the implementation of constitutional government is nothing more than paving the way for peace and unity. In the case of the draft constitution, the government also made major concessions. The principles for revising the draft even changed the nature of the "separation of powers and functions" and "the people have rights and the government has the ability" of the Five-Power Constitution, making the future government fall into the old rut of "mutual checks and balances, unable to move." The resolution on military issues did not even specify how many divisions the Communist Party's army should be reduced to, but first stipulated that the Central Army should be reduced to ninety divisions within six months to show impartiality. Such major concessions by the government in order to ensure the successful conclusion of the conference are probably undeniable even to those who are opposed to the government. The Kuomintang representatives often claim to be the largest party. Because they recognize that political power is a responsibility rather than a right, as long as it is beneficial to the country and the people, as long as it can truly achieve "political democratization and military nationalization," everything else can be tolerated. Based on this spirit of generosity and tolerance, they have achieved the effect of laying the foundation for peace and nation-building. "Sincerity and trust" are things that communicate with each other. We are all human beings, and we all have the same nature. Moreover, we are all Chinese citizens. If you are sincere and trustworthy, I will naturally be sincere and trustworthy. Therefore, we also believe that the President's guarantee in his reply to foreign journalists, "believing that the Communist Party will be able to earnestly implement the nationalization of the military," was said frankly after he had certainty.</p>
<p>However, in the past two weeks, the telegrams from various sources have reported many things that people dare not believe will happen. Logically, we believe that these things should not have happened. But in reality, there are such reports. We know that the government is unwilling to publicize such "harsh" incidents in order to show its sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution. However, since politics is required to embark on a democratic track, democratic practices should let the people know the facts and publicly comment. Hiding and avoiding things is not the norm in democratic countries. According to the news we have obtained, there have been intermittent Communist military actions in various places in the past ten days. The more important ones are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rehe: (1) The Communist troops in Chifeng were renamed the Security Team. Since the end of last month, they have been robbing, killing, and destroying the Nailing Station in the city, and forcing the people to suggest that the mediation executive team suggest the autonomy of Chifeng. (2) There were frequent movements in the area of Wafang in Ningcheng and between Suizhong and Jianchang, in an attempt to surround the flanks of the National troops.</p>
<p>(2) Liaoning: (1) The Communist troops in the area of Qingyuan, Fushun, and Benxihu in southeastern Shenyang are actively gathering in the southwest and northwest of Shenyang in an attempt to attack the urban area. (2) The railway bridges from Goubangzi to Panshan were all destroyed. (3) After the Communist troops reoccupied Yingkou, they continued to harass the city.</p>
<p>(3) Hebei: (1) Besieging Yuanshi. (2) Preventing the repair of the railway tracks. (3) Attempting to attack Jianchang, having already occupied Tianyi Station.</p>
<p>(4) Shanxi: (1) The southern section of the Tongpu Railway was repeatedly destroyed. Dongguang Lianzhen has been occupied, and Mitou is still under siege. (2) Fushan Yicheng was occupied. (3) The Communist troops in the Niangziguan area are obstructing traffic on the Zhengtai Railway. (4) The Communist troops in Linfen are actively invading the west. (5) The Communist troops captured Ninggu and attacked Mengcheng. (6) The Communist troops burned the houses of the people in the city gates of Quwo and tried to attack the city. (7) The National troops attacked Qinxian.</p>
<p>(5) Shandong: (1) Fiercely attacking Jimo and attempting to besiege Yanzhou. (2) Fiercely attacking Liaocheng on the Jinpu Railway. (3) Fiercely attacking Yidu on the Jiaoji Railway.</p>
<p>(6) Henan: (1) The Communist troops in Huaxian invaded the south. (2) There were continued offensives on the border between Fengqiu and Yanjin, attempting to occupy Yanjin. (3) Obstructing the repair of the Pinghan Railway line.</p>
<p>(7) Northern Anhui: (1) The Communist troops attacked the western border of the Dabieshan base between Ying and Huo, Ling.</p>
<p>(8) Northern Jiangsu: (1) The Communist troops in Dongtai are agitating around Zhen. (2) The Communist troops in Yizheng are actively expanding their army. (3) The Communist troops in Liuhe are invading the area of Xudubridge. (4) Besieging Donghai. (5) The Communist troops in Guanyun invaded from the east and west of Xiyangzhuang and occupied Zhuma. (6) The Communist troops attacked the town of Putown in Ru. (7) The Communist troops occupied Xin'anzhen, A'hu, Niushan, Xinpu, Baitabu, and other stations. All railway bridges were destroyed.</p>
<p>(9) Hubei: (1) The Communist troops continue to destroy telecommunications equipment in various places.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's announcement, the total length of the road destroyed by the Communist troops reached 125 kilometers and 705 meters. According to the North China Daily in Peiping, more than 30 kilometers of the Jinpu Railway near Tai'an was destroyed in the middle of last month; more than 1,000 railway tracks were removed from the Pinghan Railway near Anyang; near Dongguan on the Tongpu Railway, nine bridges were destroyed, and 40 kilometers of the railway; one bridge, three kilometers of power lines, and 430 meters of railway tracks were destroyed on the Baijin Railway. These Communist troop activities of destroying transportation and obstructing road repairs are unfortunate events that have occurred in the two weeks since the cease-fire order took effect.</p>
<p>In any case, these military actions that should no longer have happened are now occurring in various places. However, for the sake of the overall situation in China and for the sake of realizing the plan for peaceful nation-building, we are extremely unwilling to believe that these are actually facts! In this contradiction between fact and hope, we should fully understand the government's painstaking efforts in never announcing such news. However, we cannot find any reason to defend the fact that the Military Mediation Executive Department, which holds great power, has not taken any measures to stop or punish the incidents after sending groups to various places to investigate the facts.</p>
<p>Just looking at the agreement to stop the conflict and restore transportation, it has been delayed for nearly a month and still cannot be fully and thoroughly implemented. Then, when will we have to wait for the reorganization of the Communist troops and the "nationalization of the military"? However, the harmonious and coordinated Political Consultative Conference of more than twenty days was painstakingly held, with people exhausted. If, in the end, the real "military nationalization" cannot be achieved in fact, and the military group continues to delay and perfunctorily cover their ears and steal the bell, and there are still "autonomous troops" in the country who are not subject to government control and dispatch, and who are free and unrestrained, then we will see that "peaceful nation-building" is nothing more than a pleasant empty slogan. What is the value? Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Chinese Communist Party should change its style, sincerely stop street conflicts, restore transportation, and "return the army to the country" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The most fashionable and popular term now is democracy. Democracy is not military rule, so if you demand democracy but refuse to give up the military, it is still a "military rule" mentality at work. We do not want to believe that there are still parties that worship "military rule" today. Democracy means that all the people are in charge, not that an individual is in charge. Only letting me be in charge is dictatorship and not democracy, so democracy is definitely not "me in charge." If everyone divides up the territory and controls the masses, refusing to hand it over to the whole country and still retains the strange shape of "a country within a country," then it is no different from allowing only one party to rule and not allowing the people to participate in politics, only allowing me to be in charge and not allowing the people to be in charge. We also do not want to believe that there are still parties today that chant democracy but still yearn for dictatorship in their hearts. Therefore, we are not only very happy to see the Kuomintang's generous and tolerant style, but also hope to see the Communist Party, the second largest party, truly change its style and truly compete with political ideas as Zhou Enlai said, and no longer use the method of controlling troops to divide the country. We only hope that we will no longer hear any "harsh" news about the Communist army from now on, and even further hope that we will no longer hear any harsh terms such as "Communist army" from now on! Only in this way will China's bright and brilliant future not be overshadowed again!</p>
<h3 id="e57">Yan Prefecture's Suffering: People Kneel to Beg for Peace <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>On the 25th, Colonel Leck, accompanied by Kuomintang and Communist representatives Tu Xuwu and Chen Shuliang, arrived in Yan Prefecture from Ji'nan by special plane at noon. They first met with Wu Huawen, commander of the 1st Column of the garrison troops stationed there, and Ma Guanghan, the magistrate of Ziyang County. According to Wu's report, the Yan Prefecture garrison was in a defensive position, not taking a single step outside, fighting entirely in self-defense. Since January 8th, Yan City had been besieged by the Communist army. The north, south, and west gates of Yan Prefecture were all occupied by the Communist army, but the city walls and the east gate airport were still in the hands of the National Army. When the ceasefire order was received, the Communist army's offensive became even more urgent, as they wanted to capture Yan Prefecture before the 13th. On the 13th, the Communist army fired over a thousand artillery shells into the city, causing 300 casualties among the defending soldiers and over 50 civilian casualties. The Communist army used scaling ladders to attack the city and twice broke into the city, but were repelled each time. On the evening of the 13th, the Communist army ceased its formal attack. It was not until the second focal point order was issued that they withdrew their siege of the north, west, and south gates on the 21st. However, a small detachment still occasionally fired artillery and guns into the city, maintaining an encirclement and prohibiting supplies from entering the city. The following demands were made: (1) Please order the Communist army to abide by the Second Ceasefire Order and withdraw to 60 li outside the city. (2) Stop the blockade and allow people to purchase food and fuel to enter the city. Later, Mr. Leck met with representatives of the people and gave a speech. According to He Jian, he spoke to the two representatives, saying that after the deadline of the ceasefire order on the 13th, military actions would cease and the besieging troops would be ordered to retreat several li from the city. If the Second Order was received, it would be absolutely and continuously obeyed. He now guaranteed that guns would no longer be fired, but as the troops inside the city still occasionally fired outwards, he requested that they also cease firing. As for the people inside the city leaving to purchase food and fuel, they would definitely not be stopped, but the garrison troops inside the city should also open the city gates and allow the people to freely enter and exit. The traffic between Tai'an and Xuzhou would be repaired as quickly as possible to allow traffic to resume. The two representatives, Tu and Chen, reported to Mr. Leck in the city that evening. On the 26th, they planned to return to Ji'nan by telegram. As they reached the gate, they saw several thousand people kneeling on the ground, weeping and begging for peace. Moreover, there were over 50,000 refugees inside the city, lacking both coal and food, and several people had already starved to death. They pleaded for a quick resolution of the city siege to save the people's lives, causing everyone to weep. Leck and Chen Shuliang explained that there would be no further conflicts in the future. Chen also assured the people that the Communist army would definitely not fire another shot. The people dispersed tearfully. However, the weather was unfavorable for flying from the airport due to the cold and snowfall, so they turned back to Yan Prefecture midway. The heavy snow continued all day and night. On the morning of the 27th, the whole city was covered in silver, the sound of guns and cannons was gone, and the atmosphere of war had completely dissipated. They left Yan Prefecture by air at 1:00 PM. When they arrived in Ji'nan, they could not land due to the weather and planned to fly to Beiping instead. However, as they approached Dexian, the weather improved, so they turned back south and arrived safely in Ji'nan at 4:15 PM. The dispute regarding the Communist army's seizure of Japanese weapons in Shandong will be described separately. (Sent from Ji'nan on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Political Consultative Conference Achieved Results - People's Livelihood Hardships Should Be Relieved - Xi Yushu Advocates the Rapid Establishment of a Consultative Council <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Xi Yushu, a representative of Shanghai Municipality and a member of the National Political Council, and inquired about the prospects of the Political Consultative Conference and municipal issues in this city. Mr. Xi made a statement, believing that after the nation's victory, the people urgently need to find stability in their lives, and solving the suffering of people's livelihood is the only key point in governance. The various items discussed are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Xi said: What the people across the country are concerned about now is not the dispute over the interests of a certain party or faction, but how to quickly resolve the national</p>
<p>people's livelihood</p>
<p>issue of suffering. For example, the ceasefire order has been issued for a long time, but transportation in various places has still been slow to recover, and compatriots who have suffered in the rear for eight years still cannot return home. In addition, prices are high, life is hard, and public resentment is boiling. Who should be blamed for this? Therefore, we should immediately implement "returning government to the people and returning the army to the state," and we should understand what Chairman Chiang declared in his closing remarks: "We must have true unity in order to have true democracy." Although the consultation has been successful, it is hoped that the agreed points will be earnestly fulfilled without any further excuses, in order to live up to the people. We, standing in the position of ordinary people, demand that</p>
<p>the suffering of the people</p>
<p>be relieved immediately, otherwise everything is empty talk. (2) Shanghai Municipal Provisional Consultative Council. Mr. Xi's opinion: Formal consultative councils have been established in various places, but Shanghai, the third largest international city, has not even produced a provisional consultative council. The need for a representative body of public opinion is more urgent now than at any time or place. However, because the baojia system has not yet been compiled and rectified, we have to go through the process of a provisional consultative council. But if we want to establish one, we should do it quickly and shorten this process as much as possible. We hope that Shanghai can move towards</p>
<p>true democracy</p>
<p>as soon as possible and become a model city of democracy for the whole country. (3) Regarding municipal finances, Mr. Xi said: The expenditures of the city's finances are indeed very serious. Because the original main sources of tax revenue, such as land and business taxes, have been assigned to the central government under the new system, and the funds that the central government should subsidize cannot be issued as scheduled, the difference between the city's treasury revenue and expenditure is now more than half. Citizens should understand and endure the appropriately increased taxes, but it is hoped that</p>
<p>local burdens</p>
<p>will still be used for local affairs, and Shanghai City, which has been struggling for eight years, will be restored. If the central government wants to help the revival of the largest city in the East, it should follow the example of the British and American governments' subsidy system for local governments, stipulate a huge amount of subsidies from the central budget, so that local construction can have a way, and the city's financial problems can be solved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Seven American Experts Flew to Taiwan Yesterday <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Seven American technical experts left Shanghai yesterday morning and flew directly to Taiwan to serve as technical advisors to the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. It is reported that these experts plan to assist Taiwan in developing oil, sugar, and chemical engineering enterprises. According to the planned schedule, they will first investigate the local industrial situation in Taiwan and then formulate a technical improvement plan, which will be submitted to the Resources Committee for approval before implementation. Among the seven people, Dr. Agloff, Robert Hundley, and Small are oil experts who will manage gasoline refining matters. Hunterling and Cooper will assist in sugar refining matters. Gordicke is a well-known chemical engineering expert who will assist in restoring fertilizer plants. The seven people are all hired by the Resources Committee and have recently come to China from the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e60">New American Cars to be Shipped to Shanghai in Six Months <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It has been five years since Shanghai had new cars on the market. A reporter inquired from various dealers and learned that due to transportation reasons, new American cars will not arrive in Shanghai until at least six months later. Currently, companies such as Ford and General Motors do not accept orders, but users can automatically apply for registration for future distribution. "Oldsmobile" can be pre-ordered, priced at US$3,000, and it is said that many orders have been placed.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Cracking Down on Illegal Tolls for Automobiles <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau approved and adjusted the taxi fares on February 1st of this year to 1,200 yuan for every twenty minutes. It is reported that a few taxi companies are still charging the original price of 1,600 yuan for every twenty minutes, which is very wrong. In order to correct illegal charges, the Public Works Bureau has stated that if passengers encounter the above situation, they can report the car number, the taxi company, the starting and ending points, and the time to the Public Works Bureau, which will immediately investigate and crack down on it to reinforce government orders.</p>

<p>The plan for this city's telephones to make international calls to places such as London and San Francisco was originally scheduled to be implemented this month, but it has been difficult to realize due to unresolved coordination. The Telecommunications Bureau has recruited twelve technicians and is still stepping up training. It is reported that calls will not be possible until at least three months later. Once the test is successful, all telephone users in this city will be able to directly communicate with overseas commercial ports.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by CNAC (China National Aviation Corporation) plane at around 5 PM yesterday. He immediately went to the Central Bank and met with Minister of Food Xu Kan for a long time. When reporters visited, they learned that his inspection of the financial situation in the capital was generally good, but the market in Nanjing was slightly depressed. It is said that he will not stay in Shanghai for long and will meet with President Song to discuss important financial matters. At 6:30 PM, Yu left the Central Bank and went to call on President Song. Those who accompanied Yu back to Shanghai this time included Sang Xiqing, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Gu Yiqun, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Lu Sen Punished for Armed Extortion <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Wei Jimin, director of the Shanghai Office of the Naval Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, arrested and interrogated Lu Sen and other illegal naval officers and soldiers after being dispatched to Shanghai to take over the Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Extortion of Gold</p>
<p>Lu Sen, 21 years old, from Shanghai, was formerly the captain of the guard of the Naval Club. Last year, he led squad leader Sun Huanliang and soldiers Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, etc., colluding with Wu Qinan, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and broke into the home of businessman Xu Zhihui with weapons. They falsely claimed to be under orders to arrest Xu Zhihui, detained Xu Zhihui for two days, and extorted seventy taels of gold. Although they ultimately failed to obtain it, their intention to threaten and defraud was against the law. At the same time, Lu Sen and Sun Huanliang colluded to commit fraud, steal and sell naval coal to merchants, and conceal a portion of the stored coal, intending to embezzle it, committing the crime of stealing military supplies.</p>
<p>Looting of Money and Goods</p>
<p>In addition to the above crimes, Sun Huanliang also led soldiers Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, and Jia Huanzhang on October 30th last year, under the pretext of catching opium addicts, and went to the home of Gan Baishun in Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, with weapons. They coerced and looted cash and jewelry, and arbitrarily detained Gan Baishun for three days. Of the above-mentioned criminals, Lu Sen and Jia Huanzhang have been arrested, while Sun Huanliang, Xia Weichang, and Wang Genquan are at large and are being strictly pursued. The naval court-martial has conducted a detailed interrogation. The presiding judge Xu Bingxian, together with judge Duo Bei, based on the criminal law and the naval, army, and air force criminal law, ruled on January 24th: (1) Lu Sen was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment for coercing merchants, intending to defraud, stealing military supplies, and condoning subordinates to plunder property. (2) Sun Huanliang was sentenced to life imprisonment for plundering property, coercing extortion, and stealing military supplies. (3) Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, and Jia Huanzhang were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for assisting in plundering property and coercing extortion. (4) Wu Qinan will be handled separately in accordance with Article 28 of the Military, Naval, and Air Force Trial Law.</p>

<p>The United States is assisting China in stabilizing its currency with a total of four batches of gold. The first batch of gold, worth approximately US$50 million, was shipped to Shanghai at the end of October last year and handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping. According to financial sources, the second batch of gold, also worth US$50 million, has been shipped from Indian ports and will arrive in Shanghai soon. This gold is used by the Central Bank as a reserve fund to maintain a stable monetary system. In addition, detailed measures for U.S. assistance to Shanghai's banks in restoring foreign trade will be announced in the near future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association hosted local reporters at the Shipping Club at 3 PM yesterday. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Association, reported on the situation of his meeting with Minister of Communications Yu in Nanjing. He said that Minister Yu expressed his determination not to give up on recovering shipping rights. In addition, the Ministry of Communications has discussed with the Four Joint Offices to provide loans to the shipping industry to encourage the salvage of sunken ships and the repair of ships. The total loss of the shipping industry during the War of Resistance was 396,330 tons. The shipping industry will soon organize a unified transportation organization to compete with shipping merchants around the world.</p>
<p>"President Pierce" Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The American President Lines' "President Pierce" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from New York via San Francisco, carrying a large number of goods, mostly foreign wine, milk powder, and other foods, in addition to paper products. It is currently unloading at the Balianjing Pier. It was originally scheduled to sail to Nanyang, Saigon, and the Philippines on the 9th, and then return to the United States via Shanghai. The company received a telegram from the Philippines yesterday stating that the labor movement is very active and has gone on strike, so the ship has cancelled its voyage to Nanyang and will return to the United States from Shanghai on the 10th, sailing directly to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and then to New York.</p>
<p>"Niuzhuang" to Sail to Tianjin</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship "Haisu" has failed to sail due to passenger problems. It is reported that over two hundred passengers were reduced yesterday and took other ships north. Therefore, the ship will leave port this morning and sail to Qinhuangdao. Passengers of the "Haiwan" ship to Qinhuangdao are also on board early, and will sail to Qinhuangdao as soon as the fuel is loaded. The "Haizhe" ship will be repaired slightly. It is reported that the "Haigan" ship plans to load gasoline and sail to Huludao. The "Haixiang" and "Hubei" will also be received in the coming days. The Bureau is preparing all the procedures. Jardine Matheson's "Niuzhuang" will arrive in Shanghai today and load relief supplies in Shanghai to sail to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau Discovered a Large Number of Hidden Supplies - Nearly Seven Hundred Cases of Confidential Reports Received <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>As of now, the investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has received more than six hundred and eighty confidential reports. The number of enemy and puppet hidden supplies discovered based on confidential reports is very large.</p>
<p>Approximately 50 Million Yuan in Bonuses Issued</p>
<p>The informant can receive a bonus of 20% of the value of the discovered supplies if the value is less than 1 million yuan, 15% for 1 million to 10 million yuan, 12.5% for 10 million to 50 million yuan, 10% for 50 million to 100 million yuan, and 5% for more than 100 million yuan. From the beginning of January this year to yesterday, the investigation team has successively issued more than 44.8 million yuan in bonuses for confidential reports, and a part of it was issued in kind, such as copper skins, refrigerators, vermicelli, water chestnut flour, alum, socks, wool fabric, cloth, shirts, and woolen yarn, which are also of considerable value.</p>
<p>Three More Cases of Escaped Supplies Discovered</p>
<p>In the past ten days, the team discovered three cases of escaped enemy and puppet supplies, among which the more significant ones are: (1) Twelve motorized sailing boats. These sailing boats belonged to the Japanese Navy, but when our navy authorities received Japanese equipment ships, these twelve motorized sailing boats were not listed in the Japanese handover inventory. It was not until November that someone confidentially reported to the investigation team, but the confidential report only knew of five ships, whose hiding place was near Fuxing Island in Yangshupu. The investigation team sent personnel to investigate and seize them, and based on this clue, discovered another seven, totaling twelve. According to the Japanese side, these sailing boats originally belonged to Japanese merchants and were requisitioned by the Japanese Navy during the war. After the surrender, these twelve motorized boats were returned to the original Japanese merchants, so they were not listed in the handover inventory to our side. However, it was found that this was a Japanese excuse. The crime of escaping and hiding ships is that they were indeed owned by Japanese merchants. This is a means of transportation, and it should also be handed over to our side for takeover. It is reported that these twelve motorized sailing boats have been transferred by the investigation team to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for takeover.</p>
<p>Hidden Houses Continue to be Discovered</p>
<p>(2) A Japanese person named Nan Jian entrusted his Chinese driver to take care of five houses located at No. 1502 to No. 1510 (all even numbers) on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi after the Japanese surrender, fearing that they would be confiscated. According to confidential reports and the testimony of the residents of the houses, it was confirmed that the properties belonged to a Japanese person, so they have been confiscated by the investigation team and will be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for disposal. (3) Deng Ruizhi, a Chinese compradore of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation, hid eleven boxes of copper coins belonging to Mitsubishi Corporation. They were discovered by the investigation team at the end of the Lunar New Year at Deng's home at No. 10 Bailu Lane, Broadway. In addition, the team continued to discover several houses of private property owned by Dong Xiujia, a traitor and former Director of the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 10 AM yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including Chairman Qian Dajun, committee members Tao Baichuan, Shen Shihua, Pan Gongzhan, He Dequi, Xu Jilong, Xuan Tiewu, Li Jilan, Ding Guitang, Feng Youzhen, Sheng Shengyi, Wu Yunshi, Xu Yongzuo, Secretary-General Shi Bangfan, and guests from various agencies. Chairman Qian Dajun read the admonition from Chairman Chiang of the General Association, and then gave a speech. Committee members He Dequi and Tao Baichuan then gave speeches successively, and finally, Secretary-General Shi Bangfan reported on the preparatory process. Then, the first meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Branch Committee was held to discuss the meeting's agenda.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Admonition</p>
<p>Science is flourishing and aviation is advancing rapidly. Its power in wartime, the bombing and destruction it causes, makes villages and houses ruins, and its peacetime contribution is to develop transportation and popularize civilization, all of which benefit from it. We have learned from eight years of lessons and experienced the Great War. We believe that without a civil aviation foundation, we cannot talk about building a country, and without air force strength, we cannot be responsible for consolidating air defense! Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the nation is being founded, all of us compatriots should be inspired and refine ourselves, each doing our best, each exerting our strength, either to help build aviation, generously donating, or to actively participate in cloud soaring, laying the foundation for civil aviation, building the revival of the Chinese nation, consolidating air defense, and shouldering the great responsibility of safeguarding world peace! The Aviation Construction Association was originally established to assist the government, guide the people, promote aviation, and build air defense. The establishment of the Shanghai Branch is also based on this purpose, hoping to enable the local people to pool their wisdom and efforts to jointly undertake difficult undertakings, with one heart and one mind, to jointly address the important tasks of construction. It is imperative to awaken compatriots at sea, develop civil aviation, and promote the brilliant culture of our nation; build air defense and permanently protect the great territory of our motherland! Be diligent, be diligent.</p>
<p>Chairman Qian's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: I am very happy that our Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Aviation Construction Association has been established today. Shanghai is the first metropolis in the country, and I hope that aviation construction work can also be the first in the country. This requires the joint efforts of all committee members to promote it, and the efforts of all staff to handle affairs, in order to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the government and expected of us by the people.</p>
<p>Next, Committee Member He Dequi and Committee Member Tao Baichuan gave speeches, and Secretary-General Shi reported at the end.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Yongfeng Bank Ordered to Suspend Operations <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly rectify the financial industry in this city, the Ministry of Finance will separately ban financial institutions that have engaged in traitorous behavior during the period of occupation and those with unsound organizations and chaotic accounts. This will bring the financial industry in this city into order and prevent any unfavorable signs from occurring again. Two days ago, Zhongfu Bank was first ordered to suspend operations. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the license of Yongfeng Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road was revoked and ordered to suspend operations immediately. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance stated in its order to the bank: The license was revoked because the bank's shareholders had</p>
<p>evidence of traitorous activities</p>
<p>and the accounts were chaotic. After the bank was ordered to suspend operations, it began liquidation yesterday. According to the bank, which was established in the 30th year of the Republic of China, with Pan Yangyao as the chairman of the board, it was allowed to continue operations after the victory because it had registered with the Ministry of Finance after the war. The Financial Inspection Office went to the bank to investigate the accounts a month ago and found that the bank had issued allocation notes of more than 100 million yuan between April and May of this year, which was too large. The</p>
<p>suspension</p>
<p>of the bank's operations this time may be related to the issuance of a large number of allocation notes. In addition, the bank currently has approximately 1,000 depositors, with deposits of more than 200 million yuan. All depositors have been notified to go to claim their deposits immediately. The main reason for the revocation of Zhongfu Bank's license was that there was evidence of traitorous activities. The bank's general manager, Sun Zhongli, served as the chairman of the puppet Flour and Wheat Committee. During the puppet regime, the bank also lent a large amount of money to the puppet regime.

<h3 id="e70">Tramways Today as Usual <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] After the employees of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company went on strike last month due to demands for improved treatment, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both labor and management for mediation, and a result was achieved. However, some issues, such as the trade union's venue, remain unresolved. Yesterday, there was another setback due to the cost of living index. Employees of the machine department began to strike at noon, and all trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating on all lines stopped selling tickets at 4:30 PM. At around 5 PM, the trams on all lines successively entered the factory and stopped operating. Labor and management immediately negotiated at the company, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to mediate. The negotiation was successfully concluded at around 6 PM. It was resolved that wages would be calculated at 1062 times the cost of living index, plus a uniform allowance of 5,500 yuan. Those with a base salary of 26 to 35 yuan would receive an additional 1,500 yuan, those with 36 to 40 yuan would receive an additional 1,000 yuan, and those with 41 to 45 yuan would receive an additional 500 yuan. The company allowed the trade union's venue to be set up behind the engine room and would move in on the 10th. All employees agreed to resume work immediately. Three trams on Route 10 were dispatched at 6:15 PM that evening to restore traffic. Tramways and buses on all lines will operate as usual from this morning.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant Colonel Olmstead, Director of the China Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), hosted a reception for the Shanghai press corps at the Duchene Hotel on Jiangxi Road yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. Forty to fifty people attended, including senior officials from the UNRRA and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Olmstead reported on three key aspects of the branch's recent work: The first is the</p>
<p>Yellow River Management</p>
<p>project. He stated that this project is being actively promoted and is expected to be completed within the year. According to investigations, the most serious damage along the Yellow River is the three-li breach near Zhengzhou, Henan. Mr. Todd, Chief Engineer of UNRRA's Yellow River management project, estimates that this breach can be repaired by July of this year. Mr. Todd recently returned from an inspection of the flood damage along the Yellow River, and reported that the damage elsewhere along the river is not as severe as rumored. The plan is to raise the dikes by one to two feet. As for the equipment and materials needed for the Yellow River management, seventeen train cars full were shipped to the area two weeks ago, and further replenishment is planned. Mr. Olmstead expressed optimism about the future of the Yellow River management project. To date, the Yellow River project has employed approximately 20,000 people, and expenditures for the purchase of equipment in the United States have reached US$3 million. The second is the reconstruction of the</p>
<p>Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>According to Mr. Du, a member of the UNRRA Shanghai Branch, who inspected the line, over one hundred bridges and culverts have been destroyed by bombing. Although they have been temporarily repaired, they cannot be used for long. Therefore, it has been decided to quickly build new bridges using military-style pontoon bridges. In terms of rolling stock, 20 new locomotives and 3,600 railcars have already been purchased. UNRRA is currently considering purchasing an additional 181 new locomotives for shipment to China. The third is to improve</p>
<p>Water Transportation</p>
<p>Mr. Olmstead stated that UNRRA and the Executive Yuan recognize that relief and rehabilitation work cannot proceed without solving the transportation problem. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is making every effort to improve water transportation. UNRRA is establishing a mission in Washington, D.C., led by Mr. Swanson, head of the organization's management team, to inspect surplus ships in the Philippines. According to the plan, a batch of tugs and barges will be allocated to China for use, including 140 landing craft, which will soon be shipped to China for urgent transportation on the Yangtze River. These ships are mostly equipped with high-speed diesel engines, which will present some difficulties in operation, but it is hoped that within three months, Chinese personnel can be trained to operate them independently. Mr. Olmstead also stated that, according to the planned schedule,</p>
<p>Trucks</p>
<p>amounting to 10,000, will be shipped to China, to be allocated by the Executive Yuan for use on highways throughout the country. The preliminary progress is very good, and it is hoped that this plan can be fully implemented. Mr. Olmstead concluded by expressing his hope that the materials and equipment currently held by UNRRA in Shanghai can be distributed to various locations as soon as possible, so that additional supplies can be requested from the headquarters.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Wuxi Renci Sanatorium Provides Free Treatment for Teachers with Tuberculosis, Applicants Must First Be Introduced by This Column <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Lu Buzhou states: "Dear Editor, I saw in the January 26th issue of your newspaper's Social Services column that a poor and sick young man named Liu Sangnian is suffering from tuberculosis and cannot afford treatment. I previously established the Renci Sanatorium in Guanshe Mountain on the shore of Taihu Lake in Wuxi. Last year, with the support of friends and relatives, I added free beds specifically for the treatment of tuberculosis. These beds are not yet fully occupied. According to the regulations, they are intended for teachers with tuberculosis, but since Mr. Liu is a young man, an exception can be made. I have enclosed the relevant free treatment procedures, all of which are printed, and would appreciate it if you could pass them on. If Mr. Liu intends to receive treatment at the sanatorium, please have him bring a letter of introduction from your office and contact me at my Shanghai office on Fuzhou Road. Furthermore, there are still vacancies in the free tuberculosis treatment beds for teachers. I respectfully request that your newspaper publish this information and introduce applicants to us. I am most grateful. Sincerely, Lu Buzhou."</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) We thank Director Lu of the Wuxi Renci Sanatorium for sending us the relevant regulations and requesting that we introduce poor and sick teachers to the sanatorium for treatment, which we will of course do. Furthermore, Director Lu is willing to provide free treatment for Mr. Liu Sangnian, even though he is not a teacher, making an exception and showing great compassion, which we deeply admire! We hope that Mr. Liu will contact us first so that we can provide an introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Newspaper Beneficiary Students Should Collect Application Forms Soon, Principals and Parents Should Pay Attention <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Loan Committee began accepting applications on the 4th, and students from all levels of schools who are in financial need are eagerly collecting application forms. Over 2,500 beneficiary students from this newspaper's previous term must bring their student identification cards to the committee at 735 Zhongzheng Middle Road within the next few days to collect and fill out the forms (elementary school groups can have the principal collect the student identification cards and pick them up all at once). Failure to do so will result in the loss of the opportunity to apply. Principals and parents should pay close attention.</p>
