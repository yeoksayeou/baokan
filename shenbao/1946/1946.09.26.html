<h3>蘇北國軍迫近寶應　沿運河南下已越涇河鎭　東台共軍主力深夜北撤</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日電〕自國軍改施自衛反擊，連續收復淮陰安後，共軍士氣已一蹶不振，節節潰退，刻沿運河南下之國軍，已越過涇河重錠，迫近黃浦。（黃浦離寳應城僅二十華里）又共軍爲挽回其在蘇北之頹勢，以圖在邵伯與國軍作最後之爭奪，連日積極備戰甚忙，廿四日自高郵開抵邵伯共軍一團，內幷有日俘三百名。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕東台共軍主力之北撤，行動詭秘，撤退時間恒在深夜，沿范公堤東畔之小時徑北走，並以紅黃二色燈籠爲信號。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕某軍事觀察家語記者稱，蘇北共軍如不及早撤退，有全部覆滅之虞，國軍逐步逼進，共軍最後退路唯有東海，今日前方消息，淮陰國軍自漁溝續向漣水推進。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰廿四日電〕共軍千餘由李家橋進犯新　鎭，因未遭抵抗，衝入市內，毀屋抓人，經平潮駐軍開往，向五接橋竄退。又電，共產黨蘇皖邊區政府副主席季方，由淮陰潛來海門，因蘇北軍事失利，將啓東共軍化整爲零，潛伏鄕間策去從事破壞工作。</p>

<p>〔本報鎮江廿五日電〕蘇北兩淮收復後，現社會秩序已次第恢復，「抗幣」已禁止使用，目前市場交易係採物物交換方式維持。蘇省府爲此，特撥二億元，供應兩淮市場需用。蘇寗分署亦於廿五日特撥麵粉三千袋，運往救濟受難災民。</p>
<h3>綏東秩序已吿恢復　國軍由冀北入察　採取面的推進有新部署</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏廿四日電〕綏東秩序已吿恢復，零星共軍，正由民團協助部隊剿除。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕據悉，平綏路國軍，行動頗穩重，針對共軍之口袋戰術，有新布置，愼戒孤軍深入，採取面的推進，冀察邊境可能以平綏路爲中心，而以兩翼同時行動，察熱邊境之凌源，日前有潛居當地之地方團隊，收復二個區，並非國軍已進抵該地。收復綏東與和之國軍，可能經張畢筩家營子直趨柴溝堡。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電」確息，昨夜續有二個師開抵冀察邊境前綫，迄今日國軍已完成其部署。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕官方息，共軍已將懷來以東鐵路，全部破壞，重兵現集結懷來，延慶，多倫方面，現尙無戰事，惟有熱河共車經多倫向該處集結整理，準備增强張家口防務。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿五日電〕中共發言人廖承志今日謂，國軍已開始向張家口謹愼推進，每日進展的八哩，最近北平來電謂，平綏綫上之國軍，正向張坦東南五十二哩處之懷來推進，而張垣西南之傅作義部，亦已越過長城，共軍則在懷來與宣化間及懷安一帶趕築防綫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿五日電〕國車從冀北向張家口推進，已入察境。國軍司令部對於張垣爭奪戰業已進行一說，旣不證實，亦不否認。惟軍界人土謂國軍現正從熱河，綏遠與河北出擊，圍迫共軍前進基地張垣。又據國軍方面消息：從北平循平綏路北進國軍，已出南口關，進駐康莊，該地共軍退往懷來，建造堅强防禦工事，軍界領袖謂懷來乃張垣門戶，將有決戰。</p>

<h3>哈埠松花江畔　共軍備戰忙碌</h3>
<p>美軍自北寗路區撤退</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕種種跡象，顯示松花江畔，即將有軍事行動，共軍現已將陶賴昭至雙城間鐵路，加以破壞，並將松江橋裝上炸藥，準備隨時炸燬。哈爾濱以南之廢鐵鐵軌枕木亦分向綏化齊齊哈爾撤運中。此外拉法北之新站火車站之各種交通建立物，亦悉被破壞，所有枕木鋼條全部運走，大水塔及附近電綫桿，亦被破壞，自來水已發生障礙，共軍似企圖阻止拉法附近國軍，沿拉濱路向哈爾濱推進。</p>

<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿五日電〕岫嚴近有宋某，痛恨共軍暴行，在該縣山岳地帶糾集人民萬餘，與共軍對抗。又蓋平以南各地，民衆多參加，並將所部編成小組，每組三五人不等，潛伏各處襲整共軍，頗受當地人民歡迎。</p>

<h3>彭部長談大局　深信將覓得解決辦法　戰事範圍不若中共宣傳廣泛</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，廿五日招待外籍新聞記者，或問彼是否認爲中國大局「已無希望」。據答：「有希望，余頗樂觀」。或請詳予解釋，彭氏稱：「君將見之。明日事固難逆料，然余深信吾人將覓得解決此問題之辦法」。彭氏復發表書面文吿稱：「政府所求者，乃和平，眞正之和平，永久之和平，而非敷衍一時之和平。吾人根據過去經騐，深知停戰命令已被中共利用，藉以凝集實力，重新攻擊，過去中共每於疲弱時，即要求和平，乘此喘息時間，重行部署，力强時即施攻擊，自一月間頒發全面停戰令後，共軍於六月間佔領長春，第二次停戰令頒布後，又攻擊德州·包圍濟南·靑島·更攻繫泰興，引起蘇北戰事，圍攻大同，又引起察哈爾戰事，凡此均可表示除非中共遵守軍隊整編計劃之協議，並確定共軍駐區，否則停戰僅係敷衍一時之和平，適於中共有利。抑此等根本條件如果立刻履行，則永久和平垂手可得」。關於戰局，彭氏謂，戰事範圍，遠不若中共宣傳之廣泛，「事實上，除察哈爾週圍區域外，其他地區戰事已吿終止，魯南隴海路一帶及冀省東北部均無戰事，蘇北僅有肅淸戰，共軍曾在蘇北多處決堤，反而阻碍共軍增援部隊之到達，並妨碍潰敗共軍之退却，被困於此等泛濫區之共軍，被俘頗多」。彭氏復加補充云：被困蘇北之共軍的三四萬人，或以政府是否擬佔張家口相叩，彭氏拒不作明確之直接答覆。據稱：戰事集中於張家口迤南及大同迤北各區，國軍將賡續鞏固其陣地，以防共軍可能反攻大同。</p>
<h3>收復區政務　將設委會處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府當局爲處理收復區各項政務，將於短期內設置綏靖區政務委員會，直屬於行政院，聞由宋院長子文，白部長崇禧兼任正副主委。</p>
<h3>饒伯森返平</h3>
<p>執行小組退出危險區</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕平軍調部美代表饒伯森，廿四日來京，訪馬。司述職，廿五日晨續與馬。司長談，十一時乘機返平。</p>
<p>〔聯合南京廿五日電〕饒伯森稱：執行小組現有退出危險區域者，因彼等顯已不能退止戰事。渠復斷然否認軍調部放棄其任務，據稱：此種行動，僅係重新部署，俾將執行小組派駐有用地點，並免得小組徒遇艱難，仍歸失敗。「無論雙方如何宣傳，軍調部國共美三方委員現仍全力合作」。此間一般人士相信，如果國軍繼續進迫張家口，而事已明顯，則軍調部將召回張家口小組，熱河赤峰小組與蘇北徐州小組，將於廿六日乘飛機離該兩地，此可證實共軍仍據守赤峰。</p>
<h3>改訂台滬匯率　奉批並無必要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠方面消息：台灣省行政長官公署前請政府當局准將台滬匯率改定爲台幣一元換法幣四十元，茲奉批示，以台灣係國內行省之一，台幣之價値與此次調整美匯匯率絕對無關，所請擬改訂台幣與法幣匯率一節，並無必要。</p>
<h3>處理日賠償問題　我已組織委員會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕聞我已組織一賠償委會，處理日本賠償問題，由翁文灝任主委，彭學沛副之，各部會首長十五人任委員，該會近曾開會一次，翁彭二氏下五日亦曾作長時期商談。</p>
<h3>陳立夫談中蘇關係</h3>
<p>斥中共不守信義破壞兩國友善</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿五日電〕中央組織部長陳立夫，本日接見本社記者，暢論中蘇及國共關係，略謂：蘇聯對於中國共產黨並未援助，過去如此，現在如此，將來亦然，僅在宣傳上則爲例外。蘇聯不致放棄其中國友人之地位而贊助無人歡迎之小團體。中共指國民黨反應，事實上中蘇之間從未發生惡感，中共不欲此種良好關係之存在，故擬散布謠言，引起誤解，使蘇聯對中國懷疑，從而破壞中蘇關係。無論何時，中共表示準備服從政府時，中蘇關係乃　於盡善。此際中共宣稱，彼等爲蘇聯之友，事實上彼等正在造成中國之反蘇情緖。中國希望與世界各國維持良好關係，但中共則企圖破壞此種對美，英，法，蘇一視同仁之良好關係，遂其自私企圖，彼等實爲不愛國者。余之政敵指余爲國民黨反動派領袖，因余堅決反對與中共諒解，殊不知余遠在一九三七年時，即率先與中共舉行談判，促成共司抗日協定，取消中國蘇維埃制度及承認蔣主席之領導，但中共不守信義，每當軍事局勢不利於中共之時，彼等即要求停戰，彼等之政治策略，僅爲軍事行動之掩護，政府仍望經由政治途徑獲得解決，但惟有中共贊成軍隊國家化，政治解決乃能生效，政府決意實行政治協商會議之決議，召開國民大會以便還政於民，希望中共將參加國民大會與改組政府，余望政府規定一時限，使中共實行政協決議，倘若期限已過而未實行，則彼等將擔負其後來之責任。陳氏最後駁斥中共對國民黨指資之三點，（一）中共稱國民黨反蘇，事實上彼等本身正在破壞中蘇友善關係。（二）中共稱國民黨反共，事實上國民黨常常試圖與中共和好，但同時希望尊重國民之意志。（三）中共稱國民黨反對民主，事實上中共私有軍隊，使民主成爲不可能。要之，政府仍圖利用種種方法，覓致政治一解決之道。</p>
<h3>何應欽談話</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會　無權干預國共糾紛</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿四日電〕何應欽將軍今對記者稱：設置由聯合國管轄之國際軍隊，乃維護世界和平之唯一方法。何將軍稱：由於運輸工具之現代化，設置國際軍隊一事，已更爲可能。在必要時，國際軍可在三四天內到達世界上任何據點。何將軍表示贊同美國管制原子能建設，並謂：中國新疆省已發現大示之　。何將軍提及最近中共之軍事挫折時謂：中共現應有所警惕，因彼等本身及全世界均已發現若輩並不若理想之堅强也。何將軍稱：國共糾紛乃中國內部問題，聯合國安全理事會無權干預。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕美使館新聞專員康納士稱：和平商談，因蔣主席未返京，周恩來赴滬，「調停人」無對象，暫無可奉吿者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕記者於消息沉悶中訪某權威人士，詢對於三人會，五人會及當前局勢之觀測，某氏稱：目前之五人會，即保三人會造成僵局後，由司徒大使所建議者，當時共產黨曾同意於五人會之召集，然待五人會召開有頭緒時，共產黨復又拒絕參加，實難以測度其用意所在。又關於國大召開問題，記者詢以如各黨派終竟拒絕參加則奈何，某氏稱，如共產黨於規定之日期不出席，則將來即令改期召開，彼等亦不致參加，如倘因此造成不可收拾之局面，責任誰屬，至易明瞭。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕外次劉　，廿五日下午三時出席中宣部之外記者招待會，曾就蘇代表葛羅米柯在安全理事會所提有關美軍駐華事，發表如左之聲明：「美國海軍陸戰隊駐在我國，係協助遣送日本人民，現日人被遣歸國者，的已超過二百萬，美軍本其爲中國戰區同盟國一員之義務，担負此一重任，其駐留我國，且曾經我國政府之話可，駐華美軍，現已减至不及一年前之半數，且以其職務即將完成之故，仍在繼續减少中，吾人並未看出美軍之暫時駐華，將如何引起國際磨擦」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕記者廿五日就史達林廿三日發表談話及葛羅米柯在安理會提議，認爲解放在華美軍，乃維持世界和平所必要一事，走訪我關係常局，據其代言人稱：史達林委員長此項談話，坦白眞誠，相信必可有益於世界和平前途。至美軍駐華一點，中美雙方曾原闡明其合法根據，並闢解種種謠諑，事實上美軍現已隨其任務之完結、逐漸撤離中國，何時撤盡，僅時間問題。該代言人並稱：已獲悉安理會已否決葛羅米柯在安理會所作之該項提議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕美大使館新聞專員康納士廿五日談：蘇代表在安理會批評美軍留華一事，涉及外交問題，即有評論，應由華府方面發表，使館方面對此「無官方聲明」。關於美軍撤退事，康氏謂：美軍正陸續撤離中國，上海美軍機構，本月底前可結束，將來僅留美軍顧問團在華，而該機構係應中國政府之邀請留華者。至海軍陸戰隊，則擔任運輸等工作，情形與陸軍不同。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕中國政界人士對於史達林之聲明謂，美軍退出中國爲維持世界和平所必需，以及蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在聯合國安全理事會中攻擊美軍駐華二事，認爲蘇聯在中國和平談判陷於絕望僵局，同時中共在各戰綫遭遇重大壓迫之際，終於公然對中共給予外交上之支援，而初露鋒铓。外交部人士稱：最近蘇聯有組織的攻擊美國對華政策，尤其美軍駐華一事，葛羅米柯之指摘乃屬必然的發展也。該方面人士又指出，周恩來之退出南京和平談判，美國方面之「退出中國宣傳週」及左派人士煽動停止偏面援助國府及美軍退出中國，凡、此種種，均與蘇聯之有計劃行動互相一致。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿五日電〕蘇聯駐安全理事會代表提出美軍駐在中國之問題後，除政府方面已覺蘇聯已無故干涉一主權國之權利而感不安外，並無爆炸性之反應。蘇大使館及中共代表團，似均不知該一發展，蘇大使館某官負謂，克村姆宮並未向駐華大使館有所訓示。中共發言人廖承志則曰，此事相當重要，已電知在滬之周恩來氏，本人不擬發表其他意見，僅希望杜魯門總統去年十二月之宣言及三强之莫斯科宣言，能保障遠東之和平而已，至於馬帥總部方面，則尙無絲毫反應。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕中央發言人王炳南今日招待報界，批許安理會蘇代表葛羅米柯有關中國問題之言論，據稱，是項言論，意在指出美軍留駐中國已非必要，因美軍在中國之使命，已吿終止。若干人士認爲，葛羅米柯之言，乃蘇聯積極與問中國事務之先聲，王氏對此，拒不置評。惟謂：葛羅米柯有其發此言論之理由，中共並未考慮將中國問題提請聯合國機構安全理事會解決。（關於安理會討論在華美軍問題請參閱第三版）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國際局勢與中國民衆　哈里曼繼任美商務部長</h3>
<p>緊接着蘇聯代表向聯合國安全理事會關於中國局勢的申訴後，我們又看見有蘇聯無首史達林對倫敦泰晤士報記者的談話，亦以速撤在華美軍爲維持和平的必要條件，對蘇聯出席聯合國安全理事會的代表爲有力的聲援。史氏對該記者所談，除涉及中國部份外，還提到世界一般局勢，特別是關於處理戰敗德國的問題及原子彈問題，而歸結於「目前並無戰爭之危險，各該國倘欲出此，當然不能成功」。此項談話發表後，據報傳消息，使四國外長齊集於巴黎的政治安氣，頓然爲之一清。而在同時，英國前任外相艾登，又在倫敦發表演說，以目前關係含有迫於眉睫的戰爭威脅，力促英美重新接近蘇聯。此與華萊士的演說，雖趣旨不盡相同，要在促使列強與蘇聯間的鴻溝能够日益接近填補起來，蘇聯元首在此際發表這篇談話，其意義自至深長。</p>
<p>自從波茨坦會議以來，英美蘇之間的關係即漸現分裂的徽象。其後在歐洲大陸上的發展，不但未能使裂痕彌復，却反使裂痕愈益深刻。到了最近，誠如英前外相艾登所云，已「含有迫於眉睫的戰爭威脅」。華萊士演說所引起的後果，使他不得不掛寇以去，是對蘇綏靖主義的一時失敗。在這個意義下，華氏的演說，就被克林姆宮利用爲一種試探，以測知英美乃至世界別處的意向。在這個時候，克林姆宮當已約略窺見美國的動向，就不得不利用一個機會來隨風轉舵，使世界大局不致真正弄僵到破裂的地步。所以英外相艾登雖以爲有着「迫於眉睫的戰爭威脅」，而蘇聯的元首倒直說出「目前並無戰爭的危險」。</p>
<p>史達林氏的談話，無疑地，是對西方國家的一種友好表示，以促成蘇聯與西方民主國家之和平合作。鑒於目前「反蘇」情緒的高漲，史氏的談話不失爲一種明智之舉。但當我們看到史氏的主張連撤在華美軍以維持世界和平，禁止使用原子彈以剝奪西方國家的一種有力武器，是其「言歸於好」這種企圖，原也附有條件，就是要西方各區放棄他們的地位和立塲，然後蘇聯纔可能與之接近。這無異一個人，一手自己執着刀，強迫他人尊重他的意見，一面却在嚷你們先放棄刀，我就同你們好。</p>
<p>雖然這種說法是一種聰明的企圖，但是別人也不一定都愚歷。現實政治是唯物的，同時亦是唯心的。經過了這次世界大戰後，誰都不願再有戰爭。在這種情形下，我們會經一再指出蘇聯與西方國家間的這條鴻溝趕快應該填塞。蘇聯旣然有這種友好的表示，則言歸於好，加緊合作，似乎已經重新開了門，要打破多月來的沈寂，謀得誠意的協調，也不一定爲絕對不可能。值得我們注意的，是西方國家「無條件的屈服」？抑是「有條件的妥協」？史氏的演說旣提到中國局勢，我們先要表示，堅決的反對再來一次「雅爾達」！</p>
<p>關於撤離在華美軍及蘇聯代表在聯合國安全理事會對中國局勢的指陳，本報昨已著論有所論列。我們必須再行指出：葛羅米柯在安全理事會的發言，有「中國著名人物一批所提出之呼籲，敦促美國停止干涉中國內政」這句欺人的話。「中國著名人物」的呼籲，要出諸蘇聯代表之口，則這批「中國著名人物」在中國人民心目中的地位和價值，就大成問題。這批蘇聯代表中的「中國著名人物」，與西方帝國主義從前在中國稱霸時代的「高等華人」絲毫無二，惟其有了這批人物，中國的局勢遂被硬拉到國際問題範圍裏去。在國際局勢呈露着新動向的今日，我們要籲請全國愛國的人民，一致以民族國家爲重，表示我們對國事的正當意見，尤其要表示我們對於此際美軍暫留中國的正當看法，讓全世界知道中國的民衆究竟是否可以供人玩弄的。</p>

<p>美國商務部長華萊士辭職後，杜魯門總統已任命駐英大使哈里曼繼任。哈里曼奉命後，即在英倫發表談話稱：「余能獲得機會，以商務部長之資格，加入杜魯門內閣，當極愉快。余在故總統羅斯福時代，係最活動之一員，且曾任商務部陶格拉斯顧問委員會主席，故對於商務部職務，知之其騐。同時在最近六七年來，余代表故總統羅斯福及杜魯門總統，駐節海外各國，得能直接獲悉歐亞兩洲人民所遭遇之嚴重經濟問題。各國人民對於美國，莫不期望甚殷，深望美國能予以援助，並在道義上有所倡導。余本人完全擁護杜魯門總統與國務鄉貝爾納斯所採取之外交政策，刻正遵照故總統羅斯福所揭　之崇高原則與目標，繼續努力，此乃走向和平之大道也。」世人聽了，對於華萊士辭職所引起的疑慮及揣測，都可以煥然冰釋了。</p>
<p>華萊士在紐約發表涉及外交政策的演說，引起美國政界的軒然大波，雖經杜魯門總統當機立斷，使這塲風波得趨於平息，但無論如何，在此際發生此種不幸的爭議，對於杜魯門總統的政府，究屬遺憾。而今杜魯門起用哈里曼繼任商務部長，可謂美國最適當的人選。美政府因華萊士辭職而發生的裂痕，也就獲得彌補。</p>
<p>世人對葉萊士去職後的美國政府，莫不以「杜魯門總統是否仍秉承故總統羅斯福的政治路綫」相問，同時反對派也以灘棄羅斯福政策爲理由，攻擊杜魯門總統。但是杜魯門總統任命繼華萊士之任的人選，仍爲最能理解羅斯福思想的人物，足以證明美國現行政策，仍可目爲羅斯福政策的繼續。誠如哈里曼所謂，美國政府仍依照羅斯福所倡導的路綫，繼續努力走向和平之路。</p>
<p>在華萊士辭職之後，一般人士又以爲華萊士主張「一個世界」，而杜魯門總統則抉擇了「一個政策」，勢將造成「兩個世界」，更加走向第三次大戰。這種看法，如細加研究，即可知其似是而實非。今日美國政府所採取的外交政策，仍以促進國際合作共同維持世界和平與繁榮爲基調，雅不欲在國際上再造成集團對峙的局面，引起戰爭之危機。而且以美國，實際情形而論，美國在這次大戰中，雖爲決定勝負的主角，以其廣大的人力和物力直接參戰；但是美國本國，因爲地理上的關係工業大西洋和太平洋做她的屏障，並未淪爲大戰的戰塲，國內工業不特未受戰爭的浩刧，而且其生產的潛力，較戰前更加膨脹。一俟美國戰爭工業恢復到平時狀態之後，其所有的製造品，足供本國之用而有餘，且可輸出國外，供給其他各國的需要，使戰後各國人民都能與美國共享和平與繁榮。所以哈里曼說：「美國平時生產擴充之後，除供給國內人民之所需外，並可作爲出口貨，以供他國人民所需。此乃美國國內獲致繁榮與幸福之主要基礎。美國能與其他各國合作並不斷援助各國人民，其主要基礎固然在此；世界各國人民所渴望之持久和平，其主要基礎亦即在此。」</p>
<p>美國對外政策唯一的目標，端在如何締造世界和平；而使美國政治外交家最感棘手的問題，也就在如何與蘇聯安然相處。在理論上，大家都知道，戰後列強如欲締造世界和平，則非賴中美英蘇法五強通力合作不可；而且大家都明瞭，締造和平更難於職勝，列強非以戰時駢肩作戰同生共死的精神來合作，真正的和平決不能實現。但是按之實際，列強在思想上的紛歧如何消除？列強在利害上的衝突如何調和？彼此不能互相諒解而愈結愈深的猜疑又如何冰釋？這些都是嚴重的問題。哈里曼部長曾出使莫斯科，對於蘇聯的政情，知之甚騐。今後對於政府所採取之對蘇政策，必當有所貢獻。預料戰後國際關係的演變，經濟利益，將爲重要決定因素之一。所以美國商務部首腦的見解，對於其外交政策的決定，也有相當的力量。</p>

<h3>安理會否決蘇建議　我代表稱美軍留駐中國　事前曾取得我政府同意</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖廿四日電〕蘇聯曾建議安理會要求各國報吿其海外駐軍情形一項問題列入議程，頃由聯合國安理會以七票對二票，予以否決。法國挨及棄權，波蘭附和蘇聯主張。安理會旋即全體休會。定本週四復會，屆時將舉行閉幕式，並考慮向聯合國大會報吿之問題。埃及代表於會間指出埃及現正與英方談判英軍撤退之問題，談判如果失敗，埃及毅然決然向安理會申訴。</p>
<p>中國代表夏晋麟聲稱，英美兩國軍隊留駐各國，均曾取得各該國政府之同意，不得認爲對和平之威脅。蘇代表所提要求，並無聯合國憲章規定可資依據，亦不致引起國際摩擦。至於美軍留駐中國，曾得中國政府之同意，美軍且負有與中國政府合作之任務，抑且美國從未干涉中國內政，一俟其任務完成，美軍即將離開中國，此事應由中美二國政府自行決定云。波蘭代表支持蘇聯之要求稱，安理會不應否認任何會員國有發表意見之權利。美代表答稱，渠之代表團記錄，顯示美國願意討論各種建議，多多益善，但渠對於蘇聯不遵照憲章之規定經由適當途徑向有關係之政府提出此項問題一事，表示遺憾。渠續稱，渠之國家毫無隱蔽，凡美軍所駐之地點，均可由報紙中獲悉之。蘇代表重述其先前之指摘，並稱，安理會旣有權採取維持世界和平之措施，自更有權探取情報。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十四日電〕報章及電台宣布史達林之談話，表示並無戰爭之眞正危險後，莫斯科之居民均感覺輕鬆及滿意，戰爭之恐懼，已因史達林一語而消滅矣。今晨有大批羣衆在報紙分發站等候早報之揭示，閱後均吐出一個「好」字，然後掉頭而去。購報者列成長隊，耐心等候，情况堪稱少見。蘇聯人民對於史達林有完全之信任，史達林若曰「沒有戰爭」，人民即確信沒有戰爭。最近蘇聯人民對於戰爭均有惴惴不安之感覺，甚至以舊有之迷信觀念，以證明其不安心理之正常。譬如莫斯科最近到有大批香菇，舊語云，「香菇收成好，戰爭免不了」，因此人民乃益信戰爭眞不免發生矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿五日廣播：在杜魯門總統宣佈民主黨員在今年十一月之競選中將以爭取世界和平與增加生產爲依歸後，最近解職之商長華萊士今日已回返民主黨之營陣。據悉，渠已同意在未來選舉中，支持「値得推薦」之民主黨員，此點對於民主黨之獲勝，大有助益。</p>

<h3>伊朗土著叛亂　南部發生激戰　亞省談判延期舉行</h3>

<h3>德發動對蘇聯戰爭前　日德幕後外交概況</h3>
<p>故戰犯松岡筆記透露</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿五日電〕遠東國際法庭辯護人方面今日聲請傳前德駐日大使沃特到庭對質，但遭審判長拒絕。檢察官方面今日續提出種種證件，其中松岡與史塔瑪之會談記錄稱：一九四〇年九月，德駐日特使史塔瑪偕同大使沃特晤見日外相松岡，表示（一）德國希望此次大戰不擴展爲全世界之大戰，允不希望美國參戰；（二）德國不要求日本作軍事上之援助，但望牽制美國，阻止其參戰；（三）防止日美及德美戰爭之唯一辦法，係日德義間成立諒解或協定，而表示毅然之態度；（四）德國承認並協助日本在東亞之政治指導權；（五）對蘇接近，使日德義協定後有利，德國準備調解日蘇問題。又一九四一年一月卅一日，沃特致德外長急電稱：因世界局勢陷於僵局，日方刻正致力威嚇美國，末次，白島等行動派主張對新加坡取防禦性之攻擊，此項攻擊固屬有望，然苟變爲長期經濟戰爭，則不利於日本。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿五日電〕辯護律師克寗漢今日稱：自戰爭結束以來，蘇聯在遠東之行動，使東條等日主要戰犯較在戰爭結束時更有獲釋之機會。日本投降後所發生之種種事態，至少證明日人之恐懼，亦有一部份係準確而有理由者。渠吿合衆社記者謂；渠所指蘇聯在東北之活動，事實證明日本對蘇侵略所起之恐懼，對日德義聯擊極有關係。渠在其報吿之一節中，以「蘇聯之國際罪犯地位」爲題，內稱「吾人如何能使莫斯科之司法制度與民主國家之司法制度相調和？」</p>
<h3>埃首相發表勝明　印度應自由統一</h3>

<h3>中东之謎　（下）</h3>
<p>— 巴魯第原著　文豪節譯</p>
<p>石油問題</p>
<p>但是石油問題也不可忽視。中東的石油，百分之九十五以上，不管是已開採的戚蘊藏的都握於英美集團之手。但近來蘇聯和伊朗訂立了一個協定，開採伊朗北部之石油，這件事必將產生很大的影響，因爲英美對於油經國所給的利益，雖己較過去爲大，但像俄國那樣對於油權國肯將利益平分秋色，那却是絕無僅有。道件事不僅將使阿拉伯諸國和伊朗對於英美集團要求修改以前所訂約石油協定，並且也可波及亞洲其他石油諸國，例如印度尼西亞便是一例。</p>
<p>阿拉伯國家主義</p>
<p>英國爲了維持自己在中東的地位，近來不惜對於帝國內外的阿拉伯人和伊斯蘭人頻送秋波。</p>
<p>在兩次大戰中，一種熾烈的國家主義精神侵人了許多阿拉伯人的心靈。「政治地理的結合」這個口號甚囂塵上。他們先擬合併少數國家，最後則把所有阿拉伯語言國家，合併起來。但是阿拉伯人，因爲他們政治社會背景之複雜，對於這種聯盟始終在猶豫。此外還有許多其他的障礙物，例如國聯給與英法的代管地，包含着巴勒斯坦，黎巴嫩，叙利亞，以及伊拉圭；薩地皇室和赫什米底皇室間的仇視；黎巴嫩基督徒之不願參加何拉伯國家；巴勒斯坦問題；以及英國在阿拉伯諸國中所推行的均勢政策，等等。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦英代管地，仍然是一個十分困難的問題。英美特別委員會曾建議移殖十萬猶太人進去，但不許猶太人在那兒建國，這使得阿拉伯人和猶太人都同聲反對，在阿拉伯人激烈地反對後不久，杜魯門總統於這個報吿却深加讚許。不過當俄國的勢力出現於西亞的這個時候，英國更加可能被阿拉伯人仇視。俄國人對於猶太民族主義一向是不同情的，因此阿拉伯人正好伸手向其求援。</p>
<p>阿拉伯同盟</p>
<p>當阿刺伯人明白了「政治地理結合」的不可能以後，他們便從事於統一阿拉伯的努力，其結果便是阿拉伯同盟之成立，這是由許多阿拉伯國家所組成的，總部設於開羅。最初其主要工作是阻止猶太民族主義之擴展，而使巴勒斯坦絕對受阿拉伯人的控制，後來其工作範圍，日益擴大。由於對外政策之一致與夫文化經濟之聯絡，團結阿拉伯的基石於是漸漸形成，這個同盟可能成爲伊斯蘭敎的一個潛伏力量，它的勢力已經擴充到東方阿刺伯以外。英國對於這個同盟，十分友好，所以俄深恐其成爲英國的工具，雖然該同盟會　懇地表示，其目的只在雜糊阿拉伯的利益而已。</p>
<p>人民的情狀</p>
<p>中東人民的情狀如何呢？在戰時，他們的領袖大多作戰上觀，一般的生活水準已較戰前爲佳十因爲他們對於作戰國家可以出售貨物和勞力。現在戰爭已結束，一般羣衆又深感生活的痛苦了。但其目光已集中到勞工權利和社會改革一般知識分子大多集中其力量以推翻保守制度。共產黨和左翼份子，爲數甚小，但組織完善，且態度堅決。</p>
<p>美國人對於英國的帝國主義，雖多憎惡，但對於英國的政策，却是援助的，因爲她認爲英國是她的第一道防綫。</p>
<p>中東的大部分人民，情形是非常窘迫。雖然幾個近代的農業工業設計，正在硏究之中，想用它來解決一般人民的生活，但這些計劃照例是握在保守分子手中，而這般保守分子所關心的只是他們自己的利益，而非一般羣衆的幸福。</p>
<p>誠然，俄國人絕非毫無準備，正如英美一樣，她在中東各國，佈滿了活躍的代理人。英美的勢力寄托在資產階層上，而俄國則以鼓動一般羣衆的不滿情緒爲能事。</p>
<p>阿拉伯有一句諺語說：「海風相爭，水手得利」。如果中東的盲目武力，最後出於一戰，我們很覺得疑問這次的水手，能否生存，而這水手是象徵着人道的。（完）</p>

<h3>中美友情洋溢　招待美軍顧問團眷屬　勵志設舉行盛會歡迎　蔣馬兩夫人聯袂出席</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕蔣夫人宋美齡女士，在公開的宴曾上，向來是難得出席的，尤其在上海·和馬歇爾夫人同時參加一個招待會，這大槪還是第一次。</p>
<p>美國的婦女們，對蔣夫人仰慕欽佩的熱誠，並不亞於中國人自己。在昨大勵志社歡迎美駐華軍事顧問團團員眷屬盛會上，她們能一睹蔣夫人的丰采，實在是很難得的機會，難怪當記者告訴幾位美國太太說「蔣夫人今天也要來參加遙會時」，她們都興奮得不得了，立刻一個個傳了過去。一位美國軍官說：「我在中國躭了二年還沒見過她一次，眞想見見她」。果然，這個歡迎會沒有使他們失望。兩位夫人在到會的一個鐘點內，始終露着笑容。我們的新朋友們，雖然對於中國處處感到生疏，可是在昨天的招待會上，充分流露了融洽，偷快的神情。我們深信中美兩國的友誼更多多增進。</p>
<p>第一批的美軍家屬，一共到了一百多位，勵志社己經爲他們預備了九個招待所。昨天舉行歡迎會的金神父路一一八號，就是第二招待所。這是一所富麗堂皇的大厦，有着美麗寬敞的花園，原來是上海「聞人」盛老三的住宅。在本年五月間，由市政府接收下來，預備給市長住，可是市長夫婦認爲這所房子太講究了，不願意要，於是就交給勵志社接管。勵志社接收後，把它稍稍整理一番，打算留給馬歇爾元帥用，可是直到今天，馬帥還未住過。馬夫人昨天第一次到這所住宅來，一定覺得格外的有趣。現在這所房子預備給其他幾位高級將官眷屬住。勵志社的招待所雖然都很講究，不過有些不同，這祗能按着階級來分配了。</p>
<p>歡迎會開始</p>
<p>歡迎會在下午三點開始，在悅耳的音樂聲中，美軍的老太太，太太帶着孩子們陸陸續續走進了大厦，就有女靑年會的幾位小姐們帮忙招待在樓上樓下參觀，可惜「盛公館」的古董已大部搬走了，剩下的一些小東西也不見得怎樣精彩。倒是花園走廊壁上掛着的</p>
<p>蔣主席夫婦照片，吸引了所有的來賓，同時不時傳出來「她眞美麗」的贊羨聲。</p>
<p>客人到了的有一百來個的時候，就開始「尋找花生米」的節目。這是祗准太太和孩子們找的，一聲「開始」令下後年老的，年輕的，打扮得鮮艶美麗的，樸素莊嚴的太太小姐們和活潑天眞的孩子們，都分散在草地上摸索花生米。再等「停止」令後，評判員檢點花生數目，結果是由白基太太以一百八十一顆得頭獎，其他還有三個獎。</p>
<p>昨天茶會中招待來賓的點心，完全是中國點心，有　薺糕，蛋撻，糖藕，燒賣，糖蓮子等。從未嘗過這些中國點心的美國太太們，都對之發生興趣。</p>
<p>兩夫人蒞止　一片掌聲</p>
<p>四點半時，蔣夫人和馬歇爾夫人在大家引領等待中步入了花園。跟着全塲熱烈鼓掌聲之後，就是一片寂靜。好奇的，仰慕的眼光全集中在蔣夫人身上，但馬天人的一身黃綠色帶咖啡色花綢的中國長旗袍，立刻又吸引了大家的注意。馬夫人的旗袍樣子和蔣夫人的一件黑底紅綠花綢長旗袍完全是一個式樣。那是出於蔣夫人的裁縫一手裁製的關係。所不同的是蔣夫人穿了一件黑灰色短絨大衣，足登黑雞皮高跟鞋，馬天人穿了一件黃狼皮短大衣，足穿黃綠色玻璃高跟鞋。記者早已聽說馬夫人穿了中國旗袍甚至比穿西服更美麗，一見之下，果有同感。</p>
<p>兩位夫人分頭在正中長桌上坐下後，有吉倫中將夫歸，氷克夫人，吳市長夫人等幾位作陪。</p>
<p>接着，黃總幹事仁霖就走到麥克風前致詞，略稱中國對於美軍協助中國並肩作戰。萬分感激，我們決定最大努力，歡迎美軍家屬，使各位能得到舒適便利。可是中國在八年抗戰之後，一切都感到缺乏困難，有招待不週之處，並希望大家原諒。</p>
<p>除了請美國來賓用中國點心外，黃總幹事並介紹潘玉珍的技術表演，客人們都表示十分滿意，孩子們尤其拍手叫好。坐在記者旁邊的一個十一歲男孩子跟記者說：「我不會來這一套。」潘家班一位女團員表演頂盤子，特別精彩，表演完後，蔣夫人特地召她過去察看頂盤子的棒，叫她當塔再表演一下，可惜那只盤子不是他們官己的，結果試了二下，還是不成。夫人看到那位小姐臉上給一杯水因風大而撥翻時，特地拿張紙叫她「楷揩眼睛。」蕭鵬飛的魔術表演，也換得滿塲鼓掌聲、。那位小朋友對此道還很熟悉，常他看到他們把鷄蛋打破了倒在一只帽子裏時，他說：「一會兒就會變出一隻鷄來了。」不過這次魔術家變的不是鷄而是一盤麵。一會，他看見變撲克牌時，他又吿訴記者：「一會兒卡都會慢慢的縮小」果然不錯。</p>
<p>對上海的印象</p>
<p>五時半宣吿散會，蔣馬二夫人走進會客室，恭候每位來賓正式介紹握手道別。於是來賓們都一路走一路說：「這是一個非常有趣的聚會，我們覺得十分高興。」</p>
<p>最後，我們不妨聽聽我們的新朋友們對中國的印象。記者和幾位太太們談話後，她們都表示「非常喜歡中國。」有一位歌伯太太說：「在我們離開美國時，我的朋友都很妬忌我們，因爲他們也想來。」又有一位太太說：「我生長在華盛頓，向來認爲華盛頓是最擠的一個城市，想不到上海比華盛頓更擠。」多數的太太小姐們都沒法表示對上海的印象，因爲她們到了才幾天，還沒機會瀏覽這個大都市。新朋友們一致感到兩難的是他們不懂中國話，買起東西來簡直莫明其妙。有一個十五歲的小姐她就要進美國學校讀書，她很誠意地吿訴記者：「我一定要學學中國話，至少叫起人力車來方便些。」</p>
<p>美國太太小姐們來到上海後，無疑的將引起大家的注意，尤其對於她們一九四六年的新裝，其實不知她們已叫苦連天了。一位太太吿訴記者，美國現在宴會應酬很少。買皮鞋一人祇能買一雙，她在臨走前和鞋店裏再三商量，說因馬上要到中國來，同時因爲她是老主顧，這才給她多買了一雙。她們看到昨天的盛大宴會，已經羨慕不置了！</p>

<h3>一場比一場精彩　羣聲隊四戰四勝　汕隊全力作戰無法抵禦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羣聲籃球隊表演，愈臻佳境，一塲比一塲精彩，昨晚以五十六比三十六擊敗汕隊，超出達二十分之多，上半時羣聲以二十七比十八佔先。觀衆二千餘人，鼓掌之聲雷動。會長錢大鈞及體育界前輩董守義等，均到塲參觀。</p>
<p>精彩絕倫</p>
<p>羣聲隊昨晚表演障碍進攻法，手法之純熟，天衣無縫，益以聯絡純熟，投籃奇準，竟使觀衆眼花撩亂，其精彩有如此者。汕隊先以穩扎穩打辦法應付，嚴密看守，絕不浪擲，無奈功夫不够，球路稍差，雖奮力作戰，盡最大努力，終難敵勁旅，卒吿屈服。</p>
<p>相差十球</p>
<p>賽前雙方隊長陳金德與陳淸江互贈錦旗後，即開始比賽。仍以楊人輝，陳金德，藥文華，蔡文章，陳金置五大將出塲，汕隊爲何立德，劉景行，陳淸江，林經聰，紀南康。上塲之制，汕隊絕對以寶貴獲球權爲主，汕隊雖賴陳淸江罰球先勝一分，但即爲蔡文華命中，後汕隊雖以四對四一度平等，此後即見羣聲活躍，形勢尙稱緊張。第二節時羣聲以最純熟，最敏捷之方法進襲，汕隊之人釘人方法，漸見粉碎，迭見蔡文華文章之連珠頻獲，上半時羣聲二十七對十八佔先。下半時汕隊仍拚與穩並用，林經聰首先遠中，但未幾又見羣聲活躍；蔡文華之神出鬼沒，無可再妙，汕隊情急之下，殊未能保持其始終穩健之作風，後羣聲蔡連科調出蔡文章，汕隊周斌替出陳淸江，局勢仍然不變，終結果羣聲以五六對三六獲勝，贏十球之多，誠非初料所及。</p>

<h3>配紗又漲十二萬　申請額近二萬件　配出五千三百件紗號仍向隅　中間商人漁利當局引以爲憾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日因紗布步漲不已，各方向紗廠聯合配銷委員會申請棉紗者，遂呈空前之踴躍。計民營各廠申請額約九千件，紡建約一萬件，合計已近二萬件之數，超過以往申請額甚鉅。旋經配銷委員會集會商討結果，計開售二十支棉紗標準數額華民營各廠三，七九七·五件，紡建一，四九六·五件，（紡建消息爲一四〇〇·五件）。開售價格以四百磅二十支棉紗爲標準，每件爲一百五十五萬元。較上次配售價，又提增十二萬元。</p>
<p>紡建昨日棉紗上午掛牌，計有八種，至晚七時許，始開行情，計配出十六支至四十二支行銷貨，大都配售予毛巾廠，染織廠，帆布廠，手工織廠及針織，內衣廠等，售價比上期步高一二十萬元，但較之黑市尙便宜得多。至於各紗號仍完全向隅，市上滯銷之八十支雙股單牛頭，現貨價開五百萬元，及六十支三股藍鳳，現貨價開三百零八萬元，較之其他紗價，高三五十萬元，是以無人辦進，惟紗號家稍有吸進</p>
<p>會後據紗廠公會理事長王啓宇及紡建公司副總經理吳味經兩氏語記者稱：此次開紗前，申請額殊爲龐大。依過去申請情形言，最多亦不過五六千件。而此次之申請額，竟近二萬件，不無投機意味存在。惟配銷委員會對各實用戶，仍酌量照配。配價雖略見提增，惟較當日二十支紗之市價，每件仍低廉二十二三萬元。據稱：該會立塲，終望能在奉行政府抑平物價之國策，及維護同業合法利益之兩大前提下，循序推進會務。所慮者，惟恐犧牲同業結果，沾實惠者非一般市民，而係牟利之中間商。</p>
<p>實銷轉旺生產反減</p>
<p>最近紗市步漲之主要原因，據稱係時値秋令，實銷轉旺，需要激增，而一方面各紗廠之生產條件，仍備受限制。以電力言，各廠每六日須停電一日。此外，電力公司有時因電荷過限，尙有不規則之臨時停電。影響所及，國民營各廠平均有三十餘萬紗錠停止工作，一部份工人，亦無形停工，產量當受影響。再則近來華北方面，紗價報漲，二十支紗每件已逾三百萬元。凡此種種，均不無影響於本市之紗價。</p>
<p>津粵停辦漲風稍殺</p>
<p>故昨日紗市續堅交易仍湧，津帮昨未見吸納粵帮反進爲吐，照理市價本有下跌之可能，然長江路及津浦綫來客搜求甚殷，咸以二十支現貨爲目標，因內地價格亦隨申市跟漲甚巨，秋銷極爲活躍，是以不惜放價採辦也，本街門銷亦旺，織廠選買四十二支雙股綫甚夥，惟近午時因黑市美匯有外商銀行拋出，已回進四千元關，金價亦降，加以津訊紗價趨跌，市塲人心蓬勃之漲勢，從而稍殺，價與昨市相較無甚參差，而期屆月杪，或許銀根抽緊，大衆亦深具戒心，如無其他變化，市勢或能質趨定局。</p>
<h3>棉布成搶購之象　坯布有價即扒龍頭無貨　公會通告切勿乘機居奇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨布市愈形高昂，採辦者以櫃銷擁擠，非進不可，而廠商爲彌補缺額，對適用坯布，有價即扒，致龍頭細布，右價無貨，藍V及五福，高至九萬四五千元，四君子老貨元嗶嘰，喊價近十一萬元，仍多扒吸，此種現象，實緣存底枯薄，與本街及客銷同時發動，遂成供不應求之狀，惟午後美匯黑市驟降，銀根亦轉緊，價遂下降不少。</p>
<p>棉布公會以市價暴漲，影響民生，於昨午緊急通吿各會員，略謂：最近數日間，因金融市塲彼動甚烈，以致影響其他物價，莫不直綫上騰，棉布則以秋銷當令，實需趨殷，各路爭先採辦，北帮搜購允勁，而存底微薄，供不敷求，因之漲風暴厲，一發不可遏止。是固大勢所趨，非關人爲，然本公會負有監督市塲，抑平物價之使命，合再剴切通吿，務希各會員共州體時艱，協力穩定市價，切勿乘機居奇，高抬牟利，以重商德而安民生云。</p>
<p>綸昌棧單貨已簽訂協議</p>
<p>關係刧餘英商綸昌棉布棧單貨，自棉布公會交涉調處以來，現已解決，由棧單持有人會，與英商綸昌公會簽訂協議，問自即日起，可將棧單持往該公會辦理計核分發手續後，即可持單往綸昌棧房提貨。</p>
<h3>紡建防止囤積　逾期貨須收棧租</h3>
<p>紡建公司爲防範囤積對客戶前存該公司各廠未提之棉紗兩千包，特訂定逾期出倉，收取棧租辦法如次，</p>
<p>（一）凡八月底以前開出之單，尙未提貨者，統限五日以內（九月二十六日起至三十日止）提淸，逾期照收棧租，</p>
<p>（二）九月內開出之棧單，從寬限十日內提淸，（九月二十六日起至十月五日止）逾期照收棧租。</p>
<p>（三）貨物單位，以件計算，棉紗以四十小包爲一件，布疋以四十疋爲一件，麻袋以五百只爲一件，呢絨以四大匹（每匹六十碼）爲一件，不足一件者，比例計算，超出一件而未滿二件者，亦比例折　，　一件以外，零星小數，不足整件十分之一者，得酌免．</p>
<p>（四）每件逾限一星期，收棧租國幣一千元，第二星期二千元，以此類推，倘不足一星期者，以按一週計租。</p>
<p>（五）客戶繳租，由各該廠庫塡發收據爲憑，除此不收任何費用。</p>
<h3>售戶爭先恐後　美鈔逐步下降　當局禁止私運出口</h3>
<p>宋院長前晚在私邸接見中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，就連日美鈔暴漲及取締辦法等，作縝密之商討，並籌商切實制止辦法，昨日貝氏再度堅決表示匯　將行調整之說絕對不確，央行對於合乎申請規定之必需品進口外匯，均儘量供給，又悉央行前嚴格規定，不准以美鈔抵充外匯頭寸，惟私運美鈔出口者仍多，致比次黑市暴漲，現當局決將嚴格禁止美鈔私運出口，凡未經核准而私運在二百元美金以上者，一律沒收。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔開始平和，一般游資棄鈔就金，欲漲乏力，晨開四二〇〇元，即吿爭售，曾低至四〇三〇元復有小部份買戶活動，中途升至四二八〇元，近午又開始　瀉，曾低至四〇〇〇元，午刻在四一〇〇元左右盤旋，午後洋行回籠貨續有傾售，常局復有對策發表，曾跌至三八〇〇元而後吿回，最後在四〇〇〇元光景，結果較前收　小一五〇〇元，港票亦自八三〇元起　小至七八〇元左右，結果亦跌五〇元，港匯最後八〇〇元有售，印匯九八〇元，英匯一二八〇〇元有供，美匯牌價未更交易毫無。</p>
<h3>美鈔狂漲原因　私人扒吸抵補凍結外匯</h3>
<p>頃據某洋行經理稱：最近數日內，美鈔煞市價格之瘋狂上漲，與夫趨勢之堅硬，確爲過去所罕見，外間傳說原因不一，有謂外輪續有到埠，進口業大量扒吸美鈔結付貨款，有謂政府將再度提高外匯，謠諑紛紜，莫衷一是，但按之外輪到埠結付貨款，亦爲一普遍之情形，並無需要大量之美票頭寸，同時央行管理外匯暫行辦法第九條第三項規定，各銀行原有外匯存戶，至本年九月三十日尙有餘額時，應照該日市價售與中央銀行，如此則政府決不致在此際提高外匯而耗巨額法幣，惟擁有凍結外匯之私人方面，近以結售央行之時將屆，紛紛吸收美鈔，以抵補其在國外之凍結存款，若輩勢力雄厚，扒吸大量，此殆爲美鈔狂漲之主因，</p>
<h3>多頭獲利出籠　華股均已回落</h3>
<p>設昨頗有變幻，最開時承隔前午後餘風，除景福平，勤與微升外，熱股都見低價，冷股中榮辱均見，開後朱能振作，不久大戶欲出先進，忽起軌空，散戶游資盲目亂撞，中途竟放異彩，無如各熱股，乘機獲利出籠者不一而足，是以迨買氣稍定後，籌碼見鬆，在升半成後之股市，終於不支吿回，惟中途微有曲折，十一時半起浮多恐慌，買戶吿寂，局勢大變，各股遂開始破入開盤綫內，爲狀不利，縱有少許空方來補，無濟於事，臨收更爲疲怯，結果較前收計永紗徽挫，美亞景福新光勤與各小半成弱，冷股中統益大通內衣景綸火柴水泥華豐五和絲業平平，所挫有限，景　則微升，中紡信和榮豐新亞公司回小半成左右，成交總額一四·〇八七，六〇〇股，內永紗佔六六四萬，景福二四〇萬，新光一六〇餘萬，信和勸　各八〇萬，美亞五〇萬，其他均零星小數，塲外各股亦稍疲軟，銀根吿緊，前途黯淡。</p>
<h3>證交規定　股價升降單位</h3>
<p>證券交易所昨將股票價格升降單位，暫定如下。股票價格升降單位</p>
<p>不滿一百元　一角</p>
<p>一百元以上不滿二百元　五角</p>
<p>二百元以上不滿一千元　一元</p>
<p>一千元以上　五元</p>
<h3>公債平疲</h3>
<p>公債欲漲乏勁，塲內逢高有兩大戶供給，形勢迄難改觀，成交不過票面四百萬元，統丙晨開二一五〇元，微升至一二八〇元，即遭壓迫，回跌至一九六〇元，臨收在二〇〇〇元，左右盤旋，結果校前收回小一二〇元，甲乙跌九〇元，丁種平，戊械亦降七〇元。</p>
<h3>銀根抽緊金價回鬆</h3>
<p>套買活躍一度高至二二九萬外</p>
<p>烚赤昨買意驟殷，一般人心對現下之金鈔比價，認爲已賤至限度，套買甚盛，央行陷於苦戰，漲勢仍方興未艾，但午後央行削價供給，立吿慘降，長開二二三萬，開後遭管制及浮多了結，美鈔報疲，不無影響，同跌至二二一萬五，始告穩定，迨夫美鈔回升，買戶忽湧，一轉瞬問上升至二二五萬光景，此時徘徊甚久，央行以二二四萬二五之價，配給一二〇條，十時後自二一四萬起，開始套買活躍，於是漲勢加急，見高至二二九萬外，此後遭受相當壓力，午刻　小至二二六萬五，午後一霎眼間央行削價傾售，浮多亦迫於銀根有所斬售，竟慘跌至一一六萬始吿平定，結果較前收亦跌六萬，飾金念三萬元，紋銀二千八，銀元微昂，暗拆銀根吿緊，息價自一角三至一角八不等。</p>
<h3>人造絲繼續上漲</h3>
<p>昨人造絲繼續高升，一二〇號天橋有光，上午從三百五十四萬元開盤，迄收盤時做八十萬元，下午最大喊過八十五萬元，中間七十五萬元有成交，後因有人趁高拋售，於是人心漸虛，最後做六十萬元，結果比上日仍大十萬元，其他雜牌各號貨，均較上日做大十餘萬元，廠經市况混亂，普通貨均提高十餘萬元，因綢廠商以人造絲價過昂，織成品售價難合成本，俱移轉目標，採辦廠經，以致持貨者皆扳價抬高，綢貨跟隨原料同時高漲，大致增盤百分之十左右，不過廠盤提高後，于父易難於進展。</p>
<h3>米價堅俏油糧猛晉</h3>
<p>米市昨南北市塲客貨登記，總計八千餘石，店方門市銷路因秈米較暢，故納胃甚殷，早市一度興起，午時轉淡，結果軋升千元，粳米到銷均細，價格堅定，白元依然少神，黃豆高定决呆，蠶豆產地貨稀，來源大减，零化續動，步漲二千餘元，小麥市情穩定，麩皮洋莊問津，廠方出貨不多，價漲一千元，麵粉無成交，生仁新貨炒坯去化活玲，績升千元，陳貨平正，紅糧酒坊進胃甚貪，續漲一二千元，油價店方門消特活，互相購買，生豆菜油均見上升五六百元至千餘元，豆餅堅挺，略加百元。</p>
<h3>市商會電財部　請準食油免稅</h3>
<p>市商會電財部爲請將生汕菜油豆油援案免稅一年，略謂「査糧食營業稅免微一年，旨在救濟民食，而豆菜油之）原料，固爲糧食，其製油用途，亦爲民食，理應列入糧食範圍內，免徵營業稅，至棉油原料雖非糧食，而製油用途則爲民食所必需，且除供應民食外，其過剩之棉油，尙可裝運出口，行銷歐洲各國，加以精煉後，以代橄欖油之用，且値此獎勵出口之時，關稅尙在開令免徵，若准免微營業稅以减輕成本，則可以大量外銷，挽回漏巵，換取國外市塲云。</p>
<h3>外股交易減少</h3>
<p>外股交易見減，除會德豐鋼業尙形平穩外，餘者都在了結者壓迫下，見挫少許，怡紗高價九一二〇〇元，英聯一一四〇〇元後，即有壓迫，無人維持而吿盤小，結果較前收計會德豐微升，鋼業平平，怡紗英聯業廣紙業怡啤均有微挫。</p>
<h3>財部注冊外商銀行　準加入票據交換所</h3>
<p>本市外商銀行大部分均己呈准財政部註册，並已先後加入銀行業同業公會　會員，茲悉，所有註册之外商　行，與華商行莊同樣准許參加票據交換所之交換會員，現已田交換所當局分別編列交換號碼云。</p>

<h3>陰影中的綏遠</h3>
<p>— 特約記者許如</p>
<p>本報九日綏遠航訊</p>
<p>綏遠在戰前有歸綏·薩拉齊·包頭·武川·固陽·托克托·和林格爾·淸永河·凉城·　　集寗·陶林·興和·臨河·五原·東勝十六縣。安北·沃野爾設治局·烏蘭察佈盟：　爾罕　·四子部落旂·烏拉特中·東·西公三旂，茂明安旂；伊克昭盟：郡王所·達拉特擴·杭錦集·準格爾旂·鄂托克旂·烏審旂·扎薩克旂。此爲烏伊兩盟十三旂·綏東正黃·廂　·　紅·正紅四旂。土默特特別旂。統計戰前綏遠全省轄境爲十八縣局，十八旂。</p>
<p>全省輸廓　十八旗廿四縣</p>
<p>抗戰期間，沃野設治局因與寗夏陶樂有糾紛，一地兩名，寗夏設治陶樂，沃野無形取銷。綏西五原，臨河兩縣，增關米倉，晏江兩縣，陜壩市，狼山設治局。伊盟達拉特　，設一組訓處，鄂托克·杭錦交界之桃力民地方設一辦事處，此兩處亦等於設治局·現在全省除十八旂未加更動外，縣市設治局共有廿四縣·市·局·處。</p>
<p>光復以後，綏東五縣—豐·集陶·凉·興被共軍佔據四縣，僅陶林一縣爲綏省府所統轄，而陶林鄕村，亦不究整。綏東四旂與綏東五縣不啻一地兩名，故四旂亦均淪人共軍手中。綏南淸水河，和林格爾兩縣，亦有許多鄕村被共軍佔據。現在保持完整者，爲烏伊兩盟十三旂，土默特旂。綏西七縣市—陜壩·臨河·朱倉·狼山·晏江·五原安北。陰山背後的兩縣—武用川·固腸。綏包火車路上的三縣—歸綏·包頭，薩拉齊縣，綏南的托克托縣，河西的東勝縣，桃力民辦事處。達拉特組訓處。共計十六縣市局處。綏南的淸水河·和林兩縣，綏東的陶林縣，縣城雖屬綏省府，鄕村已有共軍竄入盤據，</p>
<p>一團和氣　建立民主基石</p>
<p>綏遠省政府自從傳作義將軍任主席以來，迄今巳有十五年的歷史，中間經過三次的改組，今年的一次改組，人選如次：主席傳作義，委員王則鼎，（兼民政廳長），潘秀仁（兼敎育廳長），張遐民，（兼財政廳長），張彝鼎，（兼建設廳長），陳炳謙，李居義，榮祥，曾厚載，閻偉，省府秘書長于純齋。其中榮祥是土默特旂人，潘秀仁，張遐民，閻偉均爲綏遠人。省府有地方　漢知名之士四人參加，且兩人兼廳長，這是從民國以來少有的事。</p>
<p>綏遠各縣市參議會，均已正式成立，省臨時參議會，前年冬在陜壩成立，光復後遷綏，召開第二次大會，今春省參議會亦正式成立。省參議員之產生，各縣市民選一人。烏·伊兩盟，土默特旂，綏東四旂各一人。蒙漢共同參加，一團和氣，建立民主基石。省參議會議長張欽，副議長閻肅爲綏遠鉅紳，都是抗戰有功的</p>
<p>教育可憐　校舍問題嚴重</p>
<p>戰前綏遠的中等學校有省立歸綏中學，省立包頭中學，省立集寗中學，省立歸綏師範，省立女子師範，工科職校，農科職校，國立綏蒙師範，土默特旂中學，私立正風中學。綏包淪陷，學校完全停頓。後來，在綏西設有國立綏遠中學，私立奮鬥中學，綏寗師範，（在寗夏黃渠橋），國立伊盟中學，（在伊盟扎薩克旂），河西師範，（在東勝）。</p>
<p>勝利一週年，綏遠的中等學校：有規模最大，設備完善的傳主席主辦的私立奮鬥中學，規模較次的潘敎廳長主辦的私立正風中學。公立學校，有國立綏遠中學，由綏西遷移至綏包，尙無校址。國立伊盟中學，（仍在伊盟），河西師範改爲包頭簡師，地址仍在東勝，農科職校恢復了，省立包頭中學，恢復的最快。省立歸綏師範，校址破壞特甚，但已恢復開課，省立歸綏中學，頃已招生，但校址尚被軍隊佔用。</p>
<p>本來綏遠的教育，在戰前就很可憐，勝利以來，反而不如戰前了。不論省立國立，均連校址也找不到。可是私立的如奮鬥中學，則利用接收之便，校址堂皇富麗，居全綏第一。目前的情形是私立學校發達，尙有天主敎和別的慈善團體辦的私立中學，大致還不錯。小學敎育，更窮得要命，各縣小學敎員有半年未領薪的，有幾縣士紳發動捐款來維持。鄕村小學更不用說，有人視察武川縣的一個鄕村小學，比一個破爛的私塾也不如。學生不知道今年是中華民國卅五年，而設是『成紀××年。』這常然是佔極少數，但敵人的奴化敎育，還沒有廓淸，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>新聞事業　也比不上戰前</p>
<p>現在綏遠的新聞事業，海比不上戰前。綏垣有日報兩家：（一）民國日報，（黨報），（二）奮鬥日報，（政府機關報）。晚報一家：綏聞晚報。包頭有日報一家：包頭日報。戰時奮鬥日報在陜壩出刋，現在陜壩版停刋了。</p>
<p>綏遠的通訊社，十二戰區長官部主辦的新中國通訊社，因爲是官辦的，人手多，經費足，規模之大，居全省第一。其次，有綏遠新聞社，是戰前就成立的。綏蒙新聞社是戰時在綏西創辦的。</p>
<p>外埠報紙在綏遠銷行的比本地報紙還受人歡迎。銷路最多的是天津大公報，其次是北平華北日報，世界日報，南京中央日報。上海報在綏遠銷行的有申報和大公報，而申報的影印版，尤爲當地人所愛讀。</p>

<h3>民主政治論</h3>
<p>— 力行</p>
<p>恩斯C.　D.　Burns</p>
<p>譯本　商務印書館發行</p>
<p>這本會是討論政治哲學的，大意在說明民主政治底理想。照它底理想設：「民主政治乃是一種尙待創造的社會之動人情感的概念；在這種社會中，所有男女在享受文明生活底一切利益上，—如對於暴力和專制底保障，適當的財產和閑暇，都有同等的權利，使人人皆可自由發揮其固有的才能；可是這種才能最重要的要算爲一種公共的目標而和他人公共工作的才能了。所以民主的理想便包括一種社會了，其中各份子都自願對此共同的倉庫貢獻其思想和情感，並爲維持文明狀態之故，又都貢獻通常的工作。」現代通行底民主制度，距離這種理想雖很還；但因此崛起而攻擊它的右派獨裁政洽法西斯，和左派獨裁政治共產黨，也不見得合理，或許比它所攻擊的還要壞。它反復辯證，裏面有許多很新穎，很警策的意見，足供我們參考。此書已由孫斯鳴君譯成中文，現在把它摘要介紹出來。</p>
<p>民主的淵源</p>
<p>全書共七章，第一章講「民主政治底起源。」其中有一段叙述英國怎麽發展成爲民主憲政底母國，見解很透徹。據說…「英國人是第一個予君權以確實的限止，使他於決定要錢底時間和方法上自己不能不有所牽制。也是英國人，差不多九百年以來始終慣以外人爲國王，如諾爾曼皇族，伯倫脫傑納皇族；頭頓皇族，司徒皇族以及現在的哈諾佛皇族，都能很奇妙地或直接地受着本地的地主和衆議院底支配。現在大家在實際上都因襲地接受着內閣政治以及閣員對巴力門負責，乃爲英王不　英國習俗底結果」這樣說，可見民主政治底發展，大概是歷史的發展，我國人談民主往往忘記了這個教訓，這應該喚起大家注意</p>
<p>第二章「　立　福音」，主要的是講反對民主政治底理論及其制度，對於法西斯和共產黨發生底原因也有很精闢的見解。他說：「法西斯獨裁政治本一直可以回溯到馬克司底背面，可以一直回溯到馬克司敎師里智兒。—它底理論又却可歸諸十九世紀底權力政體」</p>
<p>民主和功罪</p>
<p>第三章講民主政治的功罪就民主反對派所常抨擊的—自由權，選舉權；政黨政治，以及無能的崇拜，作有力的辯護，作者說：現代對於人格底理想，並不以人爲一個原子，而是一個社會底主要部份，所以我們一提到自由，我們意思總不離開任何社會關係。也不單指對於他人底保護，而是人人各能盡其所能的權力，最重要的尤其在共同工作上爲友誼的合作。」這把十八世紀原子的個人主義已摧陷廓淸了。又說「凡理智總帶有幾分濃厚的情感底色彩。……民主政治並不把人當作計算機看待……實際上一種訴諸情感的行爲，其壞處在於低落的情感底實際使用上，而不在於情感底自身。」這也把舊時底一理性主義」大加修正了。又說：「民主政治並不含有人類智慧，皆屬平等或是使之都應該平等。人類皆爲平等，本僅是一種假設。」這把社會平等說底誤解。也明白解釋了。</p>
<p>第四章講「民主制度」分爲（一）代表底選舉，（二）反對者可以組成政黨公開討論公共政策，（三）閣員對於一位民選的議會或民選的總統負責以管理行政。「民主制度，本欲將人　　威權底自山批評，和當權者底敏捷的決斷與堅決的行動，匯集於一個同樣的政制。」又說：「在一切民主國家中，現在總算都有集權於行政部底趨勢了。這種看法，與國父所主張底權能分開說」可說英雄所見略同。又說：「民權和法治，在民主政治中是皆由法庭來維持的。現今我國一般討論民主憲政的先生們，對於這一點却少留意，這也値得特別指出。又說：「在民主的制度之下，政府底各種制度都是打成一片的」。這與國父所提倡底五權憲法的精神也很一致。</p>
<p>民主制度的兩問題</p>
<p>第五章講「民主與和平」他說：「民主政治底整個運動，本包括一種對於政治上最陳舊的傳統制度——戰爭和準備戰爭底排斥。……國聯制度乃民主政治在政府藝術方面發展底自然結果；但是王要的會員國，若非都是民主國，國聯制度將根本不能運用。」</p>
<p>第六章「民主與實業」主要的是討論民主政府所應取底勞工政策。它反對職業代表制　說：『在這本書中，我們沒有承認民主政治祇是一種競爭利益底平衡；……而祇是一種爲人人所共享共立的公共福利而表現意志底工其，則一個人底隣人與其附近的同業者，實爲可以使他學習怎樣爲一種確實的共同福利而聯合從事的最好工具。它又反對階級鬥爭。以爲『一個戰爭總需要雙方之間有一種明顯的區別；而在現代的狀態中，若要開始馬克司的戰爭，實太多無人之境。』它以爲現今在民主制度下產生的職工組合運動，及消費合作運動，已使成千成萬的勞工學會了民主政治，而在法西斯主義者或共產主義者底獨裁政府方面、所有工會都不是職工自動組織的團體，而是一種執政權的少數人底御造物。這種工會實爲使工人那種傳自奴隸文明底依賴性能趨於民主的反動。道些話都値得現今我國起草憲法和主持勞工運動的先生們，加以相當的考慮。</p>
<p>民主制度的優越性</p>
<p>第七章「民主的精神」，特別是討論民主國應有的敎育制度及其方法。它說：「欲使民主制度必然有效，則一種民主底社會的空氣，必須先在學校以及其他敎育機關中造成。」又說「民主化底敎育，必須輸入大家皆生存於一種共同生活底概念。」又說：「學校應該有助於一種新的愛國心，使之不但能防衛和凱旋；而且能與其他國家作更密切的聯絡和互相服務。」這些話我們認爲處在聯合國時代的敎育家，應當奉爲圭臬。</p>
<p>總而言之，鮑氏是個民主政治的辯護者。他認爲民主制度固尙有許多缺點；但在別種更好的制度尙沒有發明以前，應該以民主的方法——就是公開討論公共政策和自由批評，旣立威權來加以改進或廢除。像法西斯或共產黨那樣禁止公開討論和自由批評，他是最痛恨而盡情醜詆的。一則曰：「無論何種權力的制度，對於一般在其治下的人們之智力和活力，祗有使之減少。因此獨裁政治之提高領袖或少數當權者底地位，實祗以減低其多數男女老幼道德的身份爲其代價而已。」再則曰：「它們底對立，正如野蠻之與文明相抗，武　之與科學相抗一樣。」這話似未免也有點過火。從客觀的見地來說說義大利在法西斯主政時代，德　志在國社黨主政時代。所有政　經濟文化各方面，都比以前進步得多；蘇聯自布爾什維克執政以來，勵行社會主義的計劃經濟，一切科學技術，更是突飛猛進；至今美國記者報吿，　　它不進展意，也不腐敗；這都是不容掩飾的事實。可以說智力退步嗎？可以說野蠻嗎？我以爲凡屬社會科學範圍內底事物，總不免因時因地乃至今而異其善惡，不可一概而論。鮑氏這種說法，也許受了傳統的社會假設或文化標準底影響吧！</p>
<h3>最近的兒童刊物</h3>
<p>— 大燕</p>
<p>在物質條件等各項困難之下，出版一本刋物，眞不是一件客易的事；兒童刋物當然也是這樣。</p>
<p>又一件困難的事，便是兒童刋物的內容，除了要有意義，需要有現實性，更要趣味化；兒童大都是不好帶的。而書本，原來是靜的東西，因此又必需要合時代，應季節和帶着充分的活動性</p>
<p>因此，一本兒童刋物是很難討好的，這便是有些怕「蝕本」的出版者們，不敢輕易嘗試。</p>
<p>相反地，另一種有着「毒素的」連環圖畫，却一直在畸形發展，在大街小巷，無處不到地引誘着純潔的孩子們。這眞不是一個最危險現象。</p>
<p>不過我們是無法去阻止他們去讀那些有害的東西，因爲他們都有着不可抑止的求知慾，何况連環圖畫正是一種很好的形式，就是沒有內容，但是孩子們那裏知這「有毒」呢？</p>
<p>如果能用以灌輸良好的兒童知識，一定是很有成就的。過去大衆書局有聯繫良好故事的連環書出版，如「魯濱遜飄流記」，「太蘭從軍」等，相當受兒童歡迎，但那時所受壓迫太大，就漸漸淡了下去，很爲可惜；近來在各大報的連環漫畫如三毛從軍記等，孩子讀者似乎要比大人們多，因此，希望漫畫作者們，意及此，也多多爲孩子們寫一些。</p>
<p>我們祇有儘量介紹良好內容有充分活動性的兒童刋物，和用這種形式的「連環圖畫」刋物，把孩子們從那些有「毒」的「讀物」那裏拉開。嚴厲阻止不是個好辦法。</p>
<p>在最近顯得很有生的兒童刋物出版界中，祗有一本是完全用道種形式的；但一般刋物都很能注意儘量還用插同，帮助着灌輸優良的兒童知識。這些刊物，大都能合乎兒童讀物的條件，但當然還需要不斷努力地改進。</p>
<p>現在我們把那些很有前途的兒童刋物來介紹一下，供給家長們的參考。</p>
<p>兒童書局的「兒童知識」，已出版了第二期，是惟一完全用連續畫的月刋；根據出版的二期看，他們確乎是在努力地做到新，精，趣三點。連繫於圖書的文字相當簡明，岡畫並時用套色版，對於引起兒童們的興趣，大有幫助。內容也相當充實；不過對於用作孩子們「啓蒙」之用，有時似乎稍嫌繁複，應接不暇，比較更適合於低級小學生讀。在今生兒童讀物中，確可說是一本有眼光有勇氣辦的刋物。</p>
<p>「兒童世界」遷滬後由何公超先生主持，這幾期都是重慶版，據何先生在一次招待會上表示，在重慶版印完後，當即革新內容，儘量加入現實性文字，使兒童讀了，感到親切介紹各項日常智識，新的科學，使兒童們對時代了解，激勵進步，預料當能一新我人耳目。</p>
<p>篇幅比較最多的便是「小學生半月刋」是一本包含較廣而富有活動性的中高級兒童刋物。常能看到適合時代，國情，用生動有趣筆法寫成的童話故事，用簡潔明達的語句介紹的科學知識，又用「小工藝」「小學生園地」等鼓勵兒童動筆和動手，訓諫他們動手的材料比較起來是少的。文字中也有插圖，相當好，也嫌少一些。編排用橫行和大小兩種字，有便利也有缺點。不過編者韓先生和作者們的注意有充分活動性，是爲特色。</p>
<p>中國畫報社的「兒童周刋」，篇幅最少，不過要按每周出版已非易事。內容的童話，故事爲多，較乏科學；文字均能簡潔，保持過去輕鬆的作風。</p>
<p>還有一本「時代兒童」月刋，內容豐富充實，精警具體；適合於高級小學兒童閱讀。惟暑假中並未出版，少一良好兒童讀物</p>
<p>以前各大報紙如申報等，大都有兒童期刋，現在僅有大晚報一家，尙有沈百英先生編的「兒童樂園」，每逢星期一出版。最爲普遍的報紙上，缺乏兒童的食糧，眞是憾事。</p>
<p>一般地看，這些刋物的內容，文字，印刷各方面都相當地進步，也從此可見是有着一些關心兒童的敎育家和作者們的一種克盡厥職，絕不肯粗製濫造，力求進步的精神，是可以爲兒童，爲國家慶幸的。</p>
<p>賢明的家長們！多多地介紹給你的孩子們吧，那將是一件有價値的事，也是父母們應有的一些責任。</p>
<h3>讀書語錄</h3>
<p>— 李恕谷</p>
<p>「管廷耀問學，予曰，畫家言畫鬼容易，畫馬難，以鬼無質對，馬有證佐也。今講河洛太極者，各出心手圖狀紛然而致良知者又猖獗自喜，默默有物，皆畫鬼也。子志於學子臣·弟友·禮樂·兵農·亦畫馬而已矣」·（李氏遺　論學）</p>
<h3>建設地理新論</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>任美鍔作　商務印書館出版　版期：卅五年六月　一三五頁</p>
<p>在目前，我們靑年並不注意於地理書籍，尤其是課外的；這當然是由於這類書籍太「苦口」的緣故。這種態度，在我們正待復興建設的中國，是絕對錯誤的。</p>
<p>試間：戰後的復興工作是什麽？一句話回答：是靠經濟建設；由此，我們明白了注意地理書籍的重要性。戰後的紛亂的中國建設，又有待於每個靑年的努力，首先得「知」，然後去「行」；由此，我們更明白去讀的重要性。</p>
<p>任美鍔先生曾在中央，浙江，復旦等大學主講經濟地理，建設地理也很注意；，這裏，任先生把他六年來在重慶大公報發表論文十一篇，近作一篇，　集成書一册，顏曰：「建設地理新論一。</p>
<p>這本書的內容，有關於原理的三篇，工業區域的五篇，土地利用的三篇，交通地理的一篇；這些裏面，十一篇發表過的，都依照了最新的材料修正，把重複和不合目的地方已删掉。</p>
<p>翁文灝氏在這書的序言裏面也說到：「……瞻念前途，如何鞏固國基，樹立國防，以期日臻富强之境，與世界各國共維永久之和平，則來日工作，正自繁鉅……關於努力之道，苜當推重經濟建設，而建設之進行，允須明瞭因地制宜之道，均衡發展之方，以及經濟區域之劃分，與夫資源蘊藏之分佈，於是地理之智識尙矣。……任美鍔先生數年以來，選其硏究之所得，發爲文章，倡闡建設與環境相繫之故，頗爲一般人士所重視……地理智識之傳播，將由是而更廣，經濟建設之地理研究，將由是而漸興…」</p>
<p>的確，這本書是有它很廣的內容的，原理方面的三篇：地理硏究與經濟建設；經濟地理學理論的體系。這三章文章裏面，告訴了我們國文實業計劃的地理研究，論地理工程師的任務與培養；經濟地理的性質與範圍，中心思想，動熊的經濟地理學。</p>
<p>於此，我們知道經濟地理學是一種有系統的活的科學，關於它底理論的系統大致已經建立，在交通和商業地理方面，我們還沒有明確的區域地位理論，正待我們的繼續硏究來闡塲發揮。</p>
<p>工業區域的五篇：工業區域理論的硏究，實業計劃中的工業區位思想，戰後中國的工業中心，中國西南國防工業區域的輪廓。</p>
<p>這裏面，說述了工業區域抉微，動態的工業區位與政治因素與工業區械；各種工業的區位及它的原則；各　其本題作了充分地闡述解說。</p>
<p>土地利用的三篇：鋼鐵工業區位的地理硏究，舉辦全國土地利用調査芻議，貴州遵義附近之土地利用；它分述了鋼鐵工業原料與設廠位置關係，鋼鐵工業的地理分佈，中國鋼鐵工業位置的檢討等等，並有劃表分明地介紹</p>
<p>交通地理的一篇航空時代中世界地理的新形勢，正如倍根所說！「不要再迷信了，我們要放眼看看世界的現實。」在航空時代中，世界地理（包括中國）是已發生了巨大的變化，這變化的經過，書中已略述及之。</p>
<p>書中附有書評一篇，乃爲一九三八年度美國華盛頓農業部出版的農業年鑑中的Soils　and　Man「土壞與人生」這是農部專家一百餘人所合撰，確是現代世界中的主要問題之一。作了簡略的一篇介紹。</p>
<p>總之，這本書是祇費很短的時日即可讀畢，而可得不少學識，是我們靑年所必讀。</p>

<h3>山居雜綴</h3>
<p>— 戴望舒</p>
<p>山風</p>
<p>窗外，隔着夜的帷幪，迷茫的山嵐大概已把整個峯密籠罩住了吧。泠泠的風從山巓直墜下來，帶着潮濕，帶着太陽的氣味，或是帶着幾滴從山澗中飛濺出來的水珠，來叩我們玻璃窗了。</p>
<p>敬禮啊，山風！我敞開窗戶歡迎你，我敞開衣襟歡迎你。</p>
<p>撫過雲的邊緣，撫過崖邊的小花，撫過有野獸躺過的岩石，撫過緘默的泥土，歌唱的澗流，你現在來輕輕地撫我了。說啊，山風，你是否從我胸頭感到了雲的飄忽，花的寂寥，岩石的堅實，泥土的沉鬱，澗流的活潑？你會不會說：這是一個奇異的生物！</p>
<p>樹</p>
<p>路上的列樹已斬伐盡了，疎疎朗朗地殘留着可憐的樹根。路顯得寬闊了一點，短了一點，天和　的距離似乎更接近了。太陽直射到頭頂上，而直淋到身上……是的，我們需要陽光，但是我們也需要陰蔭啊！早晨鳥雀的啁啾沒有了，傍晚散步的舒徐沒有了。空虛的路，寂寞的路！</p>
<p>離門前不遠的地方，本來有一棵合歡樹，去年秋天，我也還採過那長長的莢果給我的女兒玩的。牠曾經娉婷地站立在那裏，高高地張開牠的靑翠的華蓋，寄托了我們的夢想，又給我們以淸陰。而現在，我們却祗能在虛空之中，在浮着翼片的靑空的背景上，徒然地描畫牠的靑翠之姿了。像現在這樣的夏天的早晨，牠的明綠的葉子和火紅照眼的花，會給我們怎樣的一種淸新之感啊！牠的濃蔭之中藏着雛鳥的小小的啼聲，會給我們怎樣的一種喜悅啊！想想吧，她的消失對於我是怎樣地可悲啊！</p>
<p>抱着幼小的孩子，我又走到那棵合歡樹的樹根邊來了。鋸痕已由淡黃變成黝黑了，然而年輪却還是淸淸楚楚的，並沒有給苔蘇或是芝菌侵蝕去。我無聊地數着那一圈圈的年輪：四十二圈！正是我的年齡。牠和我過了同樣的歲月，這可憐的合歡樹！</p>
<p>樹啊，誰更不幸一點，是你呢，還是我？</p>
<p>失去的園子</p>
<p>跋涉的墨慮使我失去了眼界的遼闊和餘暇的寄托。我的意思是說，自從我怕走漫漫的長途而移居到這中區的最高一條街以來，我便不再能天天望見大海，不再擁有一個小圃了。屋子後面是高樓，前面是更高的山；門臨街路，一點隙地也沒有。從此，我」便對山面壁而居，而最使我悵惘的，特別是舊居中的那一片小小的園子，那一片由我親手拓荒，耕耘，施肥，播種，灌溉，收穫過的貧瘠的土地。那園子臨着海，四周是蒼翠的松樹，每當耕倦了，拋下鋤頭，坐到松樹下面去，迎着從遠處漁帆上吹來的風，望着遼闊的海，就已經使人心曠神怡了。何况牠又按着季節，給我們以意外豐富的收穫呢？</p>
<p>搬到這裏來以後，一切都改變了。載在大車上和書籍一同搬來的耕其：鋤頭，鐵耙，錶子，尖鋤，除草耙，移植鐘，灌溉　等等，都冷落地被拋棄在屋頂平壇上，而且生了銹。這些可憐的東西，牠們應該像我一樣地寂寞吧。</p>
<p>好像是本能地，我不時想着：「現在是種番茄的時候了」，或是「現在玉蜀黍可以收穫了」，或是「要是我能從家鄉弄到一點蠶豆種就好了！」我把這種思想在我妻子面前說了出來，於是她就提議說：「我們要不要像隣居那樣，叫人桃泥到屋頂平壇上去，在那裏闢一個園地？」可是我立刻反對，因爲屋頂上的那塊平壇是那麼小，而且陽光又那麽少，給四面的高樓遮盡了。</p>
<p>於是這計劃打消了，而舊園的夢却仍舊繼續着。</p>
<p>大概看到我常常爲這種思想困惱着吧，妻在偷偸地活動了。忽然有一天，她高高興興地來對我說了：「我們可以有一個眞正的園子了。你不看見我們對隣有一片空地嗎？他們人少，種不了許多地，我已和他們商量好，劃一部份地給我們種，水也方便，不用挑。現在，你說什麼時候開始吧。」</p>
<p>她一定以爲這會給我一個意外的喜悅的，可是我却含糊地應着，心裏想：「那不是我的園地，我要我自己的園地。」可是，爲了要不使妻太難堪，我期期地回答她：「你不是勸我不要太疲勞嗎？你的話是對的，我需要休息。我們把這種地的計劃打消了</p>
<p>而舊園的夢想却仍舊繼續着，隱秘地。</p>
<p>汽車到站了。小販的叫賣聲浮進窗來。無數張如刻着「生之競爭」的字樣的陌生的好奇的蠢臉擠動在車窗下。</p>
<p>下車去的旅客有的乘人力車有的步行，在向右方與公路垂直的古道上走着。遙遠的古道上植着青靑的垂楊。又籠罩着烟。很中國風的。道的盡頭是一側幽靜的古城。這古城與我原是陌生的。但對於善於憧憬的我却成了一個</p>
<h3>站頭</h3>
<p>— 藍本</p>
<p>神秘的謎。我如墜人夢中。我默想讓占城裏一定藏着無限的幸福吧？也有火榴似的熱情吧？也有甜蜜如故鄉的初戀吧？而看旅人們却懷着各色不同的夢，魚貫地，踏着走向夢的天國的垂楊的路，愈走愈遠……終於消失在　　黃昏的灰色的城　　了</p>
<p>「爲什麽天涯總如在夢中行呢？……」口吟詩句，想起自己正是一個飄零的遊子。不知不覺間，足下的車輪又在轆蛾轉動了。</p>
<h3>匈牙利劇作家摩爾奈</h3>
<p>— 許桐華</p>
<p>如果足下在一九〇八年冬季，適在紐約觀光，足下禁不住要去看「魔鬼」，這支由匈加利劇作家弗蘭克·摩爾奈（FerenoMolnar）執筆的名劇。這也許是紐約戲劇界中有史以來的創舉，四個劇團同時公演，兩家劇團用英文對白，一家用德文，還有一家用猶太文演出。</p>
<p>魔鬼一劇不但在紐約轟動一時，而且風魔全美。劇團主持人一時找不到適宜的名角，因爲他們全在扮演劇中密勒博士這一個人物，連帶密勒博士所穿的峨冠盛服，也閙了恐慌。</p>
<p>卅餘年以來，摩爾奈的傑作，先後在紐約上演的，共有十七齣，只有少數美國劇作家能够保持此項榮譽記錄。他的重要作品有「卡洛塞爾」·「衛兵」·「好神仙」及「麗蓮安」諸劇。據稱常代作家中僅有蕭伯納，毛罕及奧尼爾氏等，可以和他媲美。</p>
<p>摩爾奈氏係在一九四〇年一月間赴美。他在一八七八年一月十二日降生於布達佩斯城。他的本姓爲鈕曼，後改今名，因爲他不願用任何有德國臭味的姓氏，出於愛國心的驅使，旨在發揚有地方性的匈加利文學。</p>
<p>他在一本戲曲集的自序中，對於過去的身世，截至一九二五年爲止，有過一段節略式的自傳：</p>
<p>「一八七八年，我在布達佩斯誕生·一八九六年，我是一個在日內瓦唸法律的學生。一八九六年，我在布達佩斯當新聞記者·一八九七年，我寫了一篇短篇故事。一九〇〇年，我寫了一部小說。一九〇二年，我成爲國內的劇作家。一九〇八年，我是名聞國外的劇作家。一九一四年，我是戰地通訊員。一九一六年，我再度爲劇作家。一九一八年，我的頭髮雪白。一九二五年，我又願意成爲在日內瓦讀法律的學生了。」</p>
<p>摩爾奈的父親是一個診務很忙的醫生。他本人回憶先時，記得有不少的病人坐在一間黑沉沉的待診室內，具有一種憂鬱沉悶的特徵。摩爾奈自小愛同病人開玩笑。有一次閙得很厲害，幾乎把他自己的祖母唬死，但是據摩爾奈自稱並無此事，他的祖母只摔斷了一條　。</p>
<p>他在求學時代，唸過不少學校。課餘愛上咖啡館小坐，取出紙筆，颼颼作畫。他的「麗運安」一劇，便是在布達佩斯市一家最勢閙的餐館中，伏在大理石面的桌桌子上寫成的。</p>
<p>摩爾奈能操法文，德文及義大利文，極爲流利。但是在一九四〇年赴美時，祇懂很少的英文。某夜，出席一次宴會。與會賓客，說的全是英文，使他很感苦痛。席散後他對一個本國人說：「我不會說英文，眞要命，我只會說：「我的帽子在那裏？」但是這句話似乎惹不起人家的注意。」現在他對英文已習之有素。他的寓所中，放了不少英文字典，正在試用英文另撰新劇本一種。</p>
<p>此外，摩爾奈不但是劇作家，又是小說家。一九〇一年刋行的「飢俄的城市」一書，諷刺布達佩斯的腐敗，甚爲有力。他的近作「再會吧，我的心」，於一九四五年由西蒙·赫斯透圖書公司出版。他自己所徧愛的作品，則是以某舞女的戀愛悲劇爲題材的一部長篇小說。</p>

<h3>文藝的永久性</h3>
<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>美國英文敎授溫齊斯特（C.Twinchster）曾說過這樣的話：「荷馬時代的學術雖然已經廢棄了；但荷馬，却就存於現在，也還不曾老，爲什麽荷馬能不被廢槳呢？這因爲他是訴諸那古今不滅的人情，就是，個人的感情雖然是瞬息間的生滅，但感情的大洋，却泛泛然存在於各時代而不變的。」</p>
<p>從這話裘，他便提出了文藝的永久性，他認爲文藝的「永久性」，是建築在「古今不減的人情」上。這裏所謂的「古今不滅的人情」，並不是唯美派所提出的「純粹藝術性」，而是文藝的「戰鬥性」和「普遍性」。從文藝的戰鬥性和普遍性裏，才能寫出那不滅的眞理，這種不滅的眞理，便構成了文藝的「永久性」。</p>
<p>假如我們不否認「生便是戰鬥」，那麼，文藝便是從這生的戰鬥中產生的。在生的道路上，人類遭遇到許多悲慘的戰鬥，在這悲慘的戰鬥裏，人們有時呻吟呼喊，有時嗟歎號泣，又有時歌頌戰勝的光榮而沉醉於歡樂和讚美巾，這時的放聲便是文藝。所以文藝是人類和現實搏鬥的結晶品，像鐵和石相碰而迸濺出的火花，是賦有無限的光和熱。</p>
<p>蔡雷特里認爲文藝是人類鬥爭的武器，這是更進一步地把生活的範疇擴大，從人與自然之爭擴展到人與人之爭，他認爲文藝不但是鬥爭中的產物，而且是鬥爭時的工具。尼采也說：「一切文章，我最愛用血寫成的。」這更加重地指出了文藝的「戰鬥性」。</p>
<p>在易下生的作品中，「傀儡家庭」和「國民公敵」，便充分地表現出戰鬥的特性，他無情地把自己的筆，對準了封建時代黑暗的家庭制度和社會制度，用戰鬥的姿態攻擊着它，促使它崩潰，增速它滅亡。</p>
<p>戰鬥的文藝固然能構成文藝的永久性，然而永久性的文藝，除含有戰鬥性而外，還具有普遍的性質。</p>
<p>文藝的創作，無疑的已掙斷了理想主義（Idealism）的柳鎖，從狹小的虛構的樊籠中走出，正踏上了現實的道路，作家們不但是寫出了個人的苦樂，而且是寫出了廣大羣衆的苦樂，文藝的創作並不是只供給貴族派的消遣，而是要作爲大衆的精神食糧，使文藝成爲大衆化的東西。</p>
<p>荷馬距離現在已快三千年了，然而荷馬却還活生生地生存在我們的腦海裏，荷馬的存在並不是他自身的不死亡，而是他的作品具有永久的價値。</p>
<p>在古希臘的時候，他從這個城市漂流到那個城市，向着廣大的羣衆歌唱，歌唱着他作品中的故事，因而他的叙事詩「依里亞特」和「奧得賽」便深深地刻劃在羣衆的心裏，故事中的人物，便和荷馬永存。這兩部大衆化的詩歌，不斷地在人們的口巾傳誦着，歌詠着，一代一代的流傳下去，至今不滅。我可以說荷馬之能永久存在，是因爲他的作品具有普遍的性質，故能永遠地傳誦於大家的口中而不磨滅。</p>
<p>從文藝的戰鬥性中，作家們便指出了時代的錯誤，揭露了社會的黑暗，他們用戰鬥的筆，摧毀了陳腐的黑暗的社會制度，給未來的時代指示出一條正確的道路。</p>
<p>從文藝的普遍性中，作家們不但是寫出了個人的苦樂，而且是寫出了大家的苦樂，使文藝成爲大家的精神食糧，而不再供奉於貴族派的花瓶裏，作爲他們無聊時的消遣品。</p>
<p>偉大的文藝創作是具有「戰鬥性」和「普遍性」的，從文藝的「戰鬥性」和「普遍性」裏，才能寫出那痛苦的眞理，這種痛苦的眞理，便構成了文藝的「永久性」。</p>
<p>最後，我寫下一首杜布諾留博夫的詩吧：</p>
<p>勿庸諂諛的彈唱詞，</p>
<p>勿庸朗誦的抒情詩，</p>
<p>勿庸歌人的頌詠，</p>
<p>却要一個靈感的惡老人，</p>
<p>吐露那痛苦的眞理。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　44</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>當晚九點鐘模樣，日陣砲火，愈來愈烈，長辛的北，東北，東邊，都有砲彈飛到。我想長辛店的我方駐軍，都在鎭西永定河一帶，鎭上和四村都是工區和村農住宅，日方砲彈，爲何要往這裏射擊？猛然我又想起了早晨探望鼎元時候的一幕。那種愁黯氣氛，又重映出來；這個一家之主，瘦骨支離，躺在床上，太太愁容滿面，强作歡容，跟我談話；梅君靜靜地往來奔走，處理病人的需要，解決弟妹們臨時發生的問題，偶然還在一旁，提撥母親一兩句漏掉了的言語，同時礎着最合適的機會，向病榻上睡着的父親　然微笑，好像要借這微笑，維繫她父親的精神似的。</p>
<p>這時很想再去看看鼎元，設法吿訴他儘快移出廠來；因爲長辛店邊緣的砲彈，目標也許就在這個廠上。可是叫他們一時移到什麼地方去呢？正在斟酌的當口，電訊來了，並且是加緊的密電，收完之後，譯了出來，乃是鶴見臨動身赴日的前一時發出。他說長辛店的電站，恐須務植西北或東南；因爲鶴見藉着這　「三部曲」計劃失敗，在總部裏給松井上了很多爛藥，要求總部把他們調回，並且極力舉荐　多，山本榮治，等來接代。這一點我很明瞭，因爲土肥原是蘭組特工的首長，松井等却是蘭組特工的部下，調同總部，就是不讓他們活動的意思。同時可以乘此把本領較弱的梅組，類如喜多之流，弄到華北來，也可少生些事端。同時也可把土肥原勢　壓低一點。</p>
<p>同時鶴見預料蘭組的首腦土肥原，必不甘心，或許要把松井等調到西北或東南，活動一翻新事業。等到松井一調動，就叫我們跟踪前去。因爲我們的目的，正是要稍稍扶助梅組松組，打擊蘭組，實行分化這三個間諜組織，鶴見又提到通州的事，要我抽空去看看。</p>
<p>這條電訊又耽擱了我半個小時，時間愈加晚了。「到底什麼時候去看鼎元；現在？還是明天早晨？」我心下商量着。北地原來有這麽一條迷信，晚上不應探望病人，因夜晚屬陰，病人最忌是陰；而且連夜探病，是表示病情凶危的意思。</p>
<p>一邊想着，一邊出了大門，預備在土山頂上去看看砲火。剛跨出門，瞥見往路局電廠去的路上，有一個長長的行列，在朦朧的月色下蠕動着。</p>
<p>「偸襲！」我吃了一驚，立刻喚人叫四號帶望遠鏡來。</p>
<p>「木村的人，抬着包裹箱籠。」四號略略探瞧一下，立刻吿訴我，「好像是往局廠裏走着。」</p>

<h3>罐頭石頭</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>公敎人員配售物品中，時常發現有霉爛等情事，許多人都表示不滿意，認爲花了錢買這些不能食用的東西，實在寃枉：而据配售處的人說，這是極少數的現象，倘使發現霉爛物品，可持原件前往調換。</p>
<p>這也不僅配售給公教人員的物品如此，即普通用作救濟的物資，也難免沒有霉爛，可是像本報日昨南昌訊所稱：「行總江西善後救濟分署，散發罐頭牛奶牛肉等救濟物品時，受此項物品機關，發現裝置罐頭木箱中，上爲罐頭，下爲石頭……」這樣的情形，就非自然的損壞，而係人爲的舞弊作祟了。</p>
<p>美國剩餘物資，撥給我們，或出讓給我們，無論是怎樣的一種方式，不知常初簽訂協定時，有沒有「霉爛損壞照退」這一條，倘使沒有，照商塲習慣，那取費一定低廉，我們決無怨責美國朋友的意思。物資數量如是龐大，運輸如是困難，所躭擱的時日一定長久，好好的東西也會變成霉爛的。</p>
<p>關於此種情形，主管人是應該迅速辦理，否則便負有延緩的責任。然而罐頭變石頭，則情節重大了，那是一種掉包，偸漏的舞弊，是在不赦之列的。</p>
<p>流行的一句俗語，形容人要錢之不擇手段，曰：「死人身上剝衣裳！」將救濟品的罐頭掉以石頭，其惡毒狠心與死人身上剝衣裳却正不相上下。</p>
<h3>關東軍那里去了　是誰在變戲法</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>本月二十一日，美國衆議院軍事委員會委員希立登與席克斯兩議員，提出意見，要求由美國政府强迫蘇聯對神秘失踪之東北一百萬日軍，加以說明。</p>
<p>這一則新聞，暫時恐怕得不着下文。我們且將過去日本駐軍東北的情形，約略追述一下：二萬九千人，其中日人（包括軍民）佔五十六萬六千人。抗戰期內，日本政府在一九四〇年曾準備「慰問袋」一百三十萬份，分發駐華日兵，其中八十萬份預定分與華北·華中·華南的日軍，其餘發給東北駐軍，可見當時駐在東北的關東軍，總數至少在五十萬人以上。</p>
<p>據本年八月五日改　社東京電稱：「據本月三日由某國返扒福岡之日人外山二郞談稱：　原屬間島守備隊汽車隊，去年十月上旬被送往某國波塞茨特，復被送往西伯利亞北都之康　　爾斯克，從事勞役。渠所屬部隊的一萬人，其他十處收容所的有關東軍八萬至十萬人。「某國」頗寬大，日俘每日得特別食物三次至五次之多，並得每日入浴。工作效率超過百分之五十以上之日，晚餐量又得增加。康索莫爾斯克係不毛之地，當地農民所得日常食物較日俘允劣，故日俘成感能獲如此優待，實出意外。平時工作主要爲掘洞及舖設自來水管，每日工作八小時。」</p>
<p>且翻舊帳</p>
<p>日俄戰爭以後，日本依一九〇五年九月之和約及同年十二月之中日審後條約，得在南滿鐵路沿綫駐兵，每一公里，駐兵十五名以內，這個駐屯東北的日本軍隊，名爲「滿洲駐屯軍」，共有一師團的實力，便是「關東軍」的前身。一九〇六年，該軍更增編「鐵道守備隊」和「旅順要塞司令部」，「重砲兵大隊」，合計約二萬人，統由「關東軍司令部」指揮，甚後更　續擴增兵力，分駐長春·遠陽·旅順·公主嶺，新義州，大石橋等地，從事佈置軍事侵略的根據。「九一八」事變便是在關東軍司令官本莊繁領導之下變動的。日軍佔據東北全境以後，一方面大事增兵，一方面積極實施移民。據一九三三年「僞滿」外交部統計局宣布，「滿洲」共有居民三千零九十</p>
<p>影子不見</p>
<p>日本投降以後，這五十餘萬關東軍的下落，變成一個謎。在投降前，關東軍的主要駐在地是瀋陽·公主嶺·鐵嶺·遼陽·安東·連山關。上列各地當我國軍前往接收時，連半個日本兵的影踪也看不到。</p>
<p>這些侵華的虎狼，罪不容誅的關東軍，難道也像那些東北工業設備一般，給人帶走了？</p>
<p>日婦索夫</p>
<p>我們隣邦的「皇軍」，總算有了下落，而且據說「頗蒙優待」，「敗軍之將」，對此自然難免有點「受寵若驚」；可惜他們聽不到自己的父母妻女，在故土組織「索夫團」，「索父團」，跪哭呼號的聲昔；道些呼泣聲，即使是過去殘殺成性的「英雄」，現在聽了，恐怕也不免要滴下兩　英雄淚的。</p>
<p>但是，我們要問：滿口反法西斯的「政治家」們，你們帶走了機器，又帶走了日俘，你們到底在玩什麽戲法？</p>
<h3>日俘之謎</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>去年，全國日軍均經解甲後，延安的同志竟廣播說南京尙有武裝日軍，當時南京的報紙曾標一標題說：「延安說南京有武裝日兵，南京人相信嗎？」讀報者莫不笑共方造謠的毫無技巧。</p>
<p>對於這一謠風攻勢，當時沒人理他；想不到現在却有了另外一個血淋淋的事實，來答覆黑白是非：誰在不擇手段地利用日俘，優待日俘？東京的索夫團在向誰呼號？</p>
<p>這些事實的作用無他，就是許多人都已覺得；再不敢把延安的廣播與小册子，當做人話聽！</p>
<p>天下最可怕者，莫過於天花亂墜的小册子！</p>
<h3>新空中降落器</h3>
<p>美國空軍上士羅蘭士，首先試騐新式的「飛行拋送器」，自高空的飛機中藉此器且跳下，其效用與降落傘同。羅氏是作此試騐的第一個人。</p>
<h3>青年之淚</h3>
<p>— 瑞雲</p>
<p>我想放聲痛快地大哭一塲，雖然別人看來我正應大大慶幸一下。</p>
<p>榜上有我的名，沒有眼花，我是考進國立某大學的電機科了。</p>
<p>二年來的玄望，二年來的藝想，今天是終於實現了，內心充滿了不可抑制底喜悅。朋友來祝賀我，同事來贊嘆我，他們都知道我失學後入職業界已二年了，他們在過去從我的言行上深深地瞭解我失學的痛苦，他們說我從此可以滿足我的求智慾，從此可以解決失學的痛苦了。</p>
<p>急忙回到家裏，十分興奮地把消息說給父母聽，照例說，他們是應當分享我底愉快的。</p>
<p>可是，出意料之外，母親迅速地把臉背轉了，袋裏掏出手帕在臉上拭淚，父親低着頭呆了好半天，房要的空氣有些窒人。</p>
<p>「本來，做父親的聽到兒子考進國立大學該覺得多麼底愉快和光榮呀！可是你的父母都老了，你惟一的哥哥又撇下了我們去追尋個人底享樂去了……唉！」父親的聲音有些顫抖，一你還是去深造吧！不要爲了我倆妨礙了你的前途，不過公費取消後，什麽人來負担你求學時底膳費呢？」父親底枯屬雙手搭在我的肩上，我偶然抬起頭來看見他的眼眶是濕的。</p>
<p>「你不要管我們，你努力地去吧！我們總有法子的，」父親默然了，我見他灰色瘦瘠底背影緩緩地移近窗口。</p>
<p>叫我回答什麼呢？</p>
<p>我想放聲痛快地大哭一塲！</p>
<h3>八齡童當父親　不是妖怪</h3>
<p>據本月廿三日申報戰，河北祁縣澗堅村一農家的八歲孩子與九歲的童養媳竟生一男孩。此事在農村看來，豈非怪事！甚至有些地方會將此小孩斫死，謂係妖怪。實則此二小孩均爲早熟，與神怪無關。</p>
<p>大凡極早熟的人，性慾特別旺盛，且係性腺內分泌特多的人，普通人的睪九或卵巢腺均係一對，但人類中亦有三個性腺的。此一對男女大概就屬於這一類。</p>
<p>這種性的怪現象，可歸咎於睪九或卵巢的過分發育，因　　的分泌旺盛，促使一切性行爲的早熟。如果施以手術割去特別　大的睪九或卵巢的一部分，也許便能正常的發育下下去。</p>
<p>但是這種閹割在普通人是不行的，欲使發育緩慢，增加壽命而去閹劃，是辦不到的。</p>
<p>然而性的移殖是可能的，本來性的分別是普通的面非絕對的，男和女本非絕對相異的兩種個體，例如「險陽人」具睪九和卵巢，呈中性的個體。如爲絕對的陰陽人，此時可施以手術除去其睪九或卵巢而使成女人或男人。</p>
<p>人類的血內，由腦下腺調節的關係，都流動着兩種性素；例如男子的尿中，有時亦可發見女性的性分泌腺素。反之，女子的尿中亦有男性的性分泌腺素存在</p>
<p>閹割的女子如移殖猩猩的卵巢，其效力祇能維持一年光景；如果女性特性不全，則注射女性激素便可痊癒。如祁縣的一對小孩，其性腺非但不用注射任何激素，反之且現分泌過剩，因之促進性機能的畸形發展而早生育。</p>
<p>這些事，其實用不着大驚小怪！</p>
<h3>文昌帝君換位</h3>
<p>— 邦</p>
<p>考學校，人多校少，第一步難關是報名難，第二步是考試難；郤千萬沒想到第三步是揭曉難。考了學校，遲遲不揭曉，一椿心事，總是丢不掉，雖是考了不一定要取，然而取不取總該有一個下文！有人說，批好了卷子而不揭曉的原因，是給予一個「鑽門路」的機會。於是，會　的（也是能够鑽的）</p>
<p>一個個縮緊了身子鑽了進去；沒路可鑽的呢？伸長了頭頸看榜不着！</p>
<p>淸朝考秀才要錢「買」，有人問金聖嘆：「考試要錢，怎麼辦」？金聖嘆答道：把孔廟中的文昌像換以財神菩薩即可」！但不知現在這種考試局面，文昌帝君像，應該換一個什麼？</p>
<p>當然，「財神」並不是用不着，像三十萬一紙題目便是其例。不過，這事似乎並不十分「香」，要「實惠」而且「正大光朋」的，最好還是經商。</p>

<h3>傳作義將軍剪影</h3>
<p>— 崇楨</p>
<p>始終坐鎮綏邊的將領</p>
<p>讀到廿二日傳作義致毛澤東的一篇沉痛的電文，使我又想起了這一位五十開外的老將軍。</p>
<p>這些年來，他一直在風沙裏奮鬥着。他始終任勞任怨坐鎭在綏遠，在那里，他曾消逝了十幾個年頭的歲月。所以，綏遠的老百姓都對他有着不可　滅的好印象。</p>
<p>從他幼時的行爲上觀察，就可以斷定了他是一個怎樣的人。常辛亥革命時，他也不過是一個尙未受完健全敎育的中學生，爲了不滿現實，爲了追隨新的理想，他毅然決然的投入了辛亥革命的陣營，以　未受過軍事訓　的他，竟參加了娘子關大戰。這一種勇氣，是任何一個靑年人所難有的，後米，辛亥革命成功了，使他得到無限的安慰與鼓勵，逐於民國六年入保定軍校第五期，翌年卒業。從此，他正式披上了戎裝，在軍旅中担當了任務。</p>
<p>離開保定後的十年，歷次戰役的功勳，造成了他很快的由一個排長　升到天津警備司令部中將司令兼第四十三師師長。從保定出身的許多將領中，他也算是很得意的一個。</p>
<p>民國二十年，山西主席　百川　軍，因視綏遠爲大西北之屛障，而好匪外患時有侵入可能，不能不物色上駟之材，担當拱衛綏遠之重責，想來想去，悠於推薦傳氏主特綏省，因此　氏便做了綏遠省主席。</p>
<p>他主政綏遠以後，以環境的關係。使他無時無刻不在警惕自己，「九一八」後，日寇步步進逼，終於廿一年間熱河吿急，察東大縣又以自治爲名，宣布獨立；至此綏遠之地位，更形重要，當時他在極艱巨的使命前，不辭千辛萬苦，朝夕訓練部隊，與民衆打成一片，隨時隨地作枕戈待且的準備。結果，敵人的陰謀是被粉碎了</p>
<p>蘆溝橋戰火揭幕後，察哈爾省主席劉汝明，忽變節，按兵不動，致使防守南口之湯恩伯將軍，側面吿急，乃飛調綏遠駐軍馳援，而劉竟拒絕假道。傳氏即迭電劉汝明，解釋誤會，仍無結果，南口遂忍痛放棄，迨湯將軍退往綏遠後，與傳氏抱頭痛哭，泣不成聲。察綏兩省，亦至此淪陷！</p>
<p>綏遠省城失守後，傳氏以戰區副司令長官之名義，統率健兒，捍衛國土，後又升爲十二戰區司令長官。他始終坐鎭綏遠，站在前綫與敵人厮殺，八年來他轉戰於氷天雪地之中，　盡艱險，眞是一個苦幹的將領。</p>
<p>去年抗戰　靜穩。共軍發出了內戰的第一槍，向傳作義襲擊，當時他曾致電朱德毛澤東請其制止：另一方面致電蔣主席說明原委，希望不要擴大爲內戰；可是共軍反咬住傳氏製造內戰。傳氏當即聲明立塲發表經過情形，並聲明願意在勝利以後解除一切軍職，聊表其忠於國家的至意。</p>
<p>現在，共軍又重演一年前的悲劇，因此傅將軍再電勸吿毛澤東先生，不要不擇手段地幹！我們讀了傳氏的電文，無一限感動。我們愛護像傳氏這樣顧念人民的將領，但我們更渴望中共的同志，不要再以「製造貧窮」的手段，以達其取得政權的目的！</p>

<h3>National Army in Northern Jiangsu Closes in on Baoying; Marches South Along the Grand Canal, Crossing Jinghe Town; Main Force of Communist Army in Dongtai Retreats North Late at Night</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Since the National Army shifted to defensive counterattacks, successively recovering Huaiyin and Anhou, the morale of the Communist army has plummeted, resulting in successive retreats. The National Army marching south along the Grand Canal has already crossed the heavily guarded Jinghe, closing in on Huangpu. (Huangpu is only twenty Chinese miles from Baoying city). Furthermore, in order to reverse its declining situation in northern Jiangsu and attempt a final struggle with the National Army in Shaobo, the Communist army has been actively preparing for war in recent days. On the 24th, a regiment of the Communist army arrived in Shaobo from Gaoyou, including 300 Japanese prisoners of war.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The northward retreat of the main force of the Communist army in Dongtai is conducted secretively. The retreat time is always late at night, moving north along the Xiaoshi Path east of the Fangong Dike, using red and yellow lanterns as signals.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] A certain military observer told reporters that if the Communist army in northern Jiangsu does not retreat early, there is a risk of complete annihilation. As the National Army gradually advances, the only retreat route for the Communist army is the East China Sea. Today's frontline news indicates that the National Army in Huaiyin continues to advance towards Lianshui from Yugou.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 24th] More than a thousand Communist troops advanced from Lijia Bridge to invade Xinqiao Town. Because they encountered no resistance, they rushed into the city, destroying houses and arresting people. The garrison troops in Pingchao were dispatched and the Communist troops fled to Wujie Bridge. Another dispatch reports that Ji Fang, the deputy chairman of the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region government, secretly came to Haimen from Huaiyin. Due to the military setbacks in northern Jiangsu, he will divide the Communist army in Qidong into smaller units, lurking in the countryside to carry out sabotage.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] As the war situation in northern Jiangsu unfolds, refugees from Funing, Lianshui, and Baoying counties are heading to Suqian and Huaiyin, waiting to return home. Relief work in Huaiyin and Huai'an has begun actively. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Relief Branch sent personnel with large sums of money and supplies to Huaiyin on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] After the recovery of Huaiyin and Huai'an in northern Jiangsu, social order is now gradually being restored. The "Anti-Japanese Currency" has been banned, and current market transactions are maintained through barter. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 200 million yuan for the needs of the Huaiyin and Huai'an markets. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch also allocated 3,000 bags of flour on the 25th to be transported to help the affected victims.</p>
<h3>Order Restored in Eastern Suiyuan; National Army Enters Chahar from Northern Hebei; New Deployment Adopting a Gradual Advance</h3>
<p>[Our Guisui Dispatch, 24th] Order has been restored in eastern Suiyuan. Scattered Communist troops are being suppressed by the local militia and troops.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the National Army on the PingSui Railway is acting quite cautiously and has a new deployment targeting the Communist army's pocket warfare tactics. They are cautiously avoiding deep penetrations by isolated forces, adopting a gradual advance. The Hebei-Chahar border may take the PingSui Railway as its center, with simultaneous actions on both flanks. Lingyuan on the Chahar-Rehe border, two districts were recently recovered by local teams residing there, and it is not that the National Army has advanced to that location. The National Army that recovered eastern Suiyuan and He County may head straight to Chaigou Fort via Zhang Bi-tong's Jia Yingzi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed reports indicate that two more divisions arrived at the front line of the Hebei-Chahar border last night. As of today, the National Army has completed its deployment.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Official sources say that the Communist army has completely destroyed the railway east of Huailai, and heavy troops are now concentrated in Huailai, Yanqing, and the Duolun area. There are no battles yet, but the Communist troops from Rehe are gathering near Duolun to reorganize and prepare to strengthen the defenses of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Communist spokesman Liao Chengzhi said today that the National Army has begun a cautious advance towards Zhangjiakou, progressing eight miles each day. Recent dispatches from Beiping say that the National Army on the PingSui Line is advancing towards Huailai, fifty-two miles southeast of Zhangjiakou, while Fu Zuoyi's troops southwest of Zhangjiakou have also crossed the Great Wall. The Communist army is rushing to build defenses between Huailai and Xuanhua, and in the Huai'an area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The National Army is advancing towards Zhangjiakou from northern Hebei and has entered Chahar territory. The National Army Headquarters neither confirms nor denies the claim that the battle for Zhangjiakou is already underway. However, military sources say that the National Army is now attacking from Rehe, Suiyuan, and Hebei, encircling the Communist army's forward base of Zhangjiakou. According to news from the National Army: The National Army advancing north along the PingSui Railway from Beiping has left Nankou Pass and is stationed in Kangzhuang. The Communist army in that area has retreated to Huailai, building strong defensive fortifications. Military leaders say that Huailai is the gateway to Zhangjiakou and that a decisive battle will take place there.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 25th] After being defeated by the National Army in Datong, Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops retreated towards Yanggao. Fu Zuoyi's and Ma Zhanshan's troops are following in pursuit and have closed in on Yanggao. Fierce fighting may break out again in that area.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Harbin Busily Preparing for War on the Banks of the Songhua River</h3>
<p>U.S. Military Withdraws from the Beining Railway Zone</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Various signs indicate that military action is imminent on the banks of the Songhua River. The Communist army has now destroyed the railway between Taolai Zhao and Shuangcheng and has placed explosives on the Songhua River Bridge, preparing to destroy it at any time. Scrap iron, rails, and sleepers south of Harbin are also being transported to Suihua and Qiqihar. In addition, various transportation facilities at the Xin Zhan Railway Station north of Lafa have also been destroyed. All sleepers and steel bars have been removed, and the large water tower and nearby power poles have also been destroyed, causing water supply disruptions. The Communist army seems to be trying to prevent the National Army near Lafa from advancing towards Harbin along the Labin Railway.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Authoritative sources here reported tonight: Because the National Army is taking Harbin as its main target, launching a sudden attack on the Northeast seems imminent. The U.S. Marine Corps is now withdrawing from various strongholds between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, including the Tangshan Great Coal Mine area operated by the British. According to well-informed sources: The withdrawal of the U.S. Marine Corps has already begun and has been accelerated in recent days. The main purpose is to avoid another Anping incident. Once the National Army attacks the Northeast, the Communist army will inevitably attack this vulnerable section of the PingSui Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] Near Xiuyan, a man named Song, deeply hating the atrocities of the Communist army, gathered more than 10,000 people in the mountainous areas of the county to confront the Communist army. Furthermore, many people in areas south of Gaiping participated, organizing their troops into small groups of three to five people each, lurking in various places to attack the Communist army, which is quite popular with the local people.</p>
<h3>National Army Advancing North in Northern Henan Only 20 Miles from Cixian</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] A telephone call from Baoding reports that the National Army advancing north along the Pinghan Railway from Anyang in northern Henan has broken through the Communist army's defense line on the north bank of the Hebei. The vanguard troops are twenty kilometers from Cixian. Fierce fighting is still taking place in the Shuangmiao area of the Liuhegou mining area. The Communist army has transferred Communist troops from southern Hebei to reinforce them overnight. Liu Bocheng's chief of staff, Li Yi, is personally commanding the front.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The main force of the Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has collapsed and is now divided into smaller units, attempting to destroy transportation in sections and cut off the National Army's connections. About ten thousand Communist troops from the Communist army in southern Hebei recently fled from northern Hebei near Gao Beidian and Zhier Huangfu, carrying a large amount of demolition equipment.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Aircraft in Northeast Packed and Shipped to Yantai</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Official news: The Communist army in the Northeast has recently packed a batch of aircraft and shipped them to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Discusses the Overall Situation; Deeply Believes a Solution Will Be Found; Scope of the War Is Not as Broad as Communist Propaganda Claims</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei received foreign journalists on the 25th. One asked if he thought the overall situation in China was "hopeless." He replied, "There is hope. I am quite optimistic." When asked to explain in detail, Peng said, "You will see it. Tomorrow's events are difficult to predict, but I deeply believe that we will find a way to solve this problem." Peng also issued a written statement saying: "What the government seeks is peace, true peace, lasting peace, not temporary peace. Based on past experience, we know that the ceasefire order has been used by the Chinese Communists to consolidate their strength and attack again. In the past, the Chinese Communists requested peace whenever they were weak, using this time to regroup and redeploy. When they were strong, they attacked. After the issuance of the comprehensive ceasefire order in January, the Communist army occupied Changchun in June. After the second ceasefire order was issued, they attacked Dezhou, besieged Jinan and Qingdao, and even attacked Taixing, causing the war in northern Jiangsu, and the siege of Datong, which led to the war in Chahar. All of this shows that unless the Chinese Communists abide by the agreement on the reorganization plan of the army and determine the areas where the Communist army is stationed, the ceasefire is only a temporary peace, suitable for the benefit of the Chinese Communists. However, if these fundamental conditions are fulfilled immediately, then lasting peace is within reach." Regarding the war situation, Peng said that the scope of the war is far less extensive than the Communist propaganda claims. "In fact, except for the area around Chahar, the war in other areas has ended. There is no war in the area around southern Shandong and the Longhai Railway and the northeastern part of Hebei Province. There is only a mopping-up operation in northern Jiangsu. The Communist army has breached dikes in many places in northern Jiangsu, which has hindered the arrival of Communist reinforcements and hindered the retreat of the defeated Communist army. Many Communist troops trapped in these flooded areas have been captured." Peng added that the three or four thousand Communist troops trapped in northern Jiangsu, or whether the government intends to occupy Zhangjiakou, Peng refused to give a clear and direct answer. It is said that the war is concentrated in the areas south of Zhangjiakou and north of Datong. The National Army will continue to consolidate its positions to prevent the possible counterattack by the Communist army on Datong.</p>
<h3>Administrative Affairs in Recovered Areas Will Be Handled by a Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to handle various administrative affairs in the recovered areas, the government authorities will establish a Pacification Zone Administrative Affairs Committee in the near future, directly under the Executive Yuan. It is reported that Premier Song Ziwen and Minister Bai Chongxi will concurrently serve as chairman and vice-chairman.</p>
<h3>Robertson Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>The Executive Group Withdraws from Dangerous Areas</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The U.S. representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, Robertson, came to Nanjing on the 24th to report to Ambassador Stuart. He continued to talk with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 25th and returned to Beiping by plane at 11:00 am.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Robertson said: The executive groups are now withdrawing from dangerous areas because they are clearly unable to stop the war. He also categorically denied that the Military Mediation Department had abandoned its mission. It is said that this action is only a redeployment, so that the executive groups can be sent to useful locations and avoid the groups encountering difficulties and still failing. "Regardless of how the two sides publicize it, the Chinese Communist and U.S. members of the Military Mediation Department are still working together with all their strength." People here generally believe that if the National Army continues to press towards Zhangjiakou, and it is obvious, then the Military Mediation Department will recall the Zhangjiakou group, the Rehe Chifeng group, and the Jiangsu Xuzhou group. They will leave the two places by plane on the 26th, which can confirm that the Communist army is still holding Chifeng.</p>
<h3>Revising the Taiwan-Shanghai Exchange Rate Is Deemed Unnecessary</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to reliable sources: The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office previously requested the government authorities to approve the revision of the Taiwan-Shanghai exchange rate to 1 Taiwan dollar for 40 legal tender yuan. Now, it has been instructed that Taiwan is one of the domestic provinces, and the value of the Taiwan dollar has absolutely nothing to do with this adjustment of the US exchange rate. There is no need to revise the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender.</p>
<h3>We Have Organized a Committee to Handle the Japanese Compensation Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] It is heard that we have organized a compensation committee to handle the Japanese compensation issue, with Weng Wenhao as the chairman and Peng Xuepei as the deputy. The heads of various ministries and commissions, fifteen people, serve as committee members. The committee recently held a meeting, and Weng and Peng also had lengthy discussions five days later.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Condemns the CCP for Breaking Faith and Destroying the Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, received reporters from this agency today and spoke freely about Sino-Soviet and KMT-CPC relations, saying: The Soviet Union has not aided the Chinese Communist Party, neither in the past nor in the present, nor will it in the future, with the exception of propaganda. The Soviet Union will not abandon its status as a friend of China and support an unwelcome small group. The CCP accuses the Kuomintang of being reactionary. In fact, there has never been any ill feeling between China and the Soviet Union. The CCP does not want this good relationship to exist, so it plans to spread rumors, cause misunderstandings, make the Soviet Union doubt China, and thus destroy Sino-Soviet relations. Whenever the CCP indicates that it is ready to obey the government, Sino-Soviet relations will be perfect. At this moment, the CCP claims that they are friends of the Soviet Union. In fact, they are creating anti-Soviet sentiments in China. China hopes to maintain good relations with all countries in the world, but the CCP is trying to undermine this good relationship with the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to achieve their selfish purposes. They are not patriotic. My political enemies call me the leader of the Kuomintang reactionaries because I resolutely oppose reconciliation with the CCP. Everyone knows that as early as 1937, I took the lead in holding negotiations with the CCP, promoting the agreement to jointly resist Japan, abolishing the Chinese Soviet system, and recognizing Chairman Chiang's leadership. However, the CCP does not keep its promises. Whenever the military situation is unfavorable to the CCP, they demand a ceasefire. Their political strategy is only a cover for military action. The government still hopes to reach a solution through political means, but only when the CCP agrees to the nationalization of the army can a political solution take effect. The government is determined to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and convene the National Assembly in order to return power to the people. It hopes that the CCP will participate in the National Assembly and reorganize the government. I hope that the government will set a deadline for the CCP to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If the deadline has passed and it has not been implemented, then they will bear the responsibility for the consequences. Chen finally refuted the three accusations made by the CCP against the Kuomintang: (1) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang is anti-Soviet. In fact, they themselves are undermining Sino-Soviet friendly relations. (2) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang is anti-communist. In fact, the Kuomintang has often tried to reconcile with the CCP, but at the same time hopes to respect the will of the people. (3) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang opposes democracy. In fact, the CCP has its own private army, making democracy impossible. In short, the government is still trying to use various methods to find a political solution.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Speech</h3>
<p>The United Nations Security Council Has No Right to Intervene in the KMT-CPC Dispute</p>
<p>[United Press, New York Dispatch, 24th] General He Yingqin told reporters today: Establishing an international army under the jurisdiction of the United Nations is the only way to maintain world peace. General He said: Due to the modernization of transportation, the establishment of an international army is now more possible. When necessary, international troops can reach any point in the world in three or four days. General He expressed his support for the United States' control of atomic energy construction and said: A large number of uranium deposits have been discovered in China's Xinjiang Province. General He mentioned the recent military setbacks of the CCP and said: The CCP should now be wary, because they themselves and the whole world have discovered that the CCP is not as strong as ideal. General He said: The KMT-CPC dispute is an internal problem of China, and the United Nations Security Council has no right to intervene.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Build Domestic Airports</h3>
<p>To Meet International Standards</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] In order to improve airport facilities so that aircraft with greater load capacity can land, the communications authorities plan to build domestic airports in stages to meet international standards, and to allow foreign aircraft to land when necessary. The first to be built will be the Longhua Airport in Shanghai. This project may be completed within this year. The Guangzhou, Kunming, and Tianjin airports are planned to be built next year.</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Continues to Support Ambassador Stuart to Help Our Country Resolve Internal Disputes; Ambassador Stuart Will Visit Hangzhou on the Fourth of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 25th, United Press] Well-informed U.S. sources reiterated that U.S. policy is still to support Special Envoy Marshall in his efforts to help resolve China's internal problems, but while Marshall says he is optimistic about success, official sources are not optimistic.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Political negotiations have completely stalled on the 25th. Government representatives are also inactive. Ambassador Stuart and his private advisor, Fu Jingbo, went out for dinner in the evening and had not returned to the embassy by 9:30 pm. The ambassador is scheduled to visit Hangzhou on October 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] U.S. Embassy Press Officer Connors said: Because Chairman Chiang has not returned to Nanjing and Zhou Enlai has gone to Shanghai, the "mediators" have no one to talk to, and there is nothing to report for the time being.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Amidst the depressing news, a reporter visited an authoritative source and asked about his observations on the Three-Person Committee, the Five-Person Committee, and the current situation. The source said: The current Five-Person Committee was proposed by Ambassador Stuart after the Three-Person Committee created a stalemate. At that time, the Communist Party agreed to the convocation of the Five-Person Committee, but when the Five-Person Committee was about to convene, the Communist Party refused to participate again, and it is really difficult to measure its intentions. Regarding the issue of the convocation of the National Assembly, the reporter asked what if all parties refused to participate. The source said, if the Communist Party does not attend on the specified date, then even if the meeting is postponed, they will not participate. If this causes an irreparable situation, it is easy to understand who is responsible.</p>
<h3>The Country Is in Distress and the Scars Have Not Healed; Chairman Chiang Humbly Declines Birthday Celebrations; Visited Tungsten Mines on the Border of Jiangxi and Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Zhongshun News Agency, Nanchang Dispatch, 25th] Chairman Chiang took a car from Ganxian to Xihuashan in Dageng on the morning of the 25th to inspect the tungsten mines, and visited Xiaoshimeiguan on the way. This place is located 20 kilometers south of Dageng and is the boundary between Jiangxi and Guangdong. There are many famous scenic spots nearby, such as Zhonggu Yan, and the scenery is extremely secluded. Every spring and autumn, many tourists visit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] October 31 of this year is the 60th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government and Director-General of the Kuomintang of China. Central and local figures have unanimously proposed to offer him a toast to celebrate his birthday to promote the grand ceremony, but the Chairman reaffirms that the country is in distress, the people's livelihood is miserable, and it is appropriate to diligently seek governance. He should not simply talk about formalities, and especially hopes that comrades in the party will understand this meaning and set an example for the whole country. The Central Executive Committee has issued an order to the whole party to comply with it. The original order is recorded as follows: "October 31 of this year is the 60th birthday of the Director-General, which is the year of rejuvenation. Wishing him boundless life is appropriate in terms of etiquette and affection, but the Director-General has repeatedly warned that it is not allowed to be held, because although the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, nation-building is yet to be completed, and there are many thorns and the scars have not healed. We should concentrate our efforts to seek governance, and should not be wasteful and talk about formalities. Therefore, we hereby order all party departments to inform all comrades to understand this meaning, and not to make a show. At that time, in addition to sending a written congratulation, there is no need to hold any ceremony. If we can follow the Director-General's instructions in the past, and each of us will do our best to contribute our talents, so that constitutional government can be implemented as soon as possible, the country can prosper, and the people can be put at ease. To wish the leader birthday is the greatest wish."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London Dispatch, 25th] Mrs. Cripps, at the invitation of Madame Chiang, is scheduled to leave for China with her daughter Becky next week. Mrs. Cripps will give Chairman Chiang a watch, which is modeled after the one worn by King George VI of England, and the style is exactly the same. Mrs. Cripps also carries a large number of precious porcelain, the insurance of which amounts to one thousand pounds.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 25th] A group of journalists from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan arrived in the province from Gu on the 9th and began their interviews. After half a month, the task was completed, and they left Nanchang by car today to go to Xun and then to Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Continues to Support Ambassador Stuart to Help Our Country Resolve Internal Disputes; Ambassador Stuart Will Visit Hangzhou on the Fourth of Next Month</h3>
<h3>U.S. Military's Presence in China Assisted in Repatriating Japanese Nationals; Our Government Granted Permission; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Erroneously Claims It Did Not Cause International Friction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Vice Foreign Minister Liu, attended a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department at 3:00 PM on the 25th, and issued the following statement regarding Soviet Representative Gromyko's proposal in the Security Council concerning the stationing of U.S. troops in China: "The U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in our country to assist in the repatriation of Japanese nationals. To date, more than two million Japanese have been repatriated. The U.S. military, as a member of the Allied forces in the China theater, has shouldered this important task. Their presence in our country has been permitted by our government. The number of U.S. troops stationed in China has been reduced to less than half of what it was a year ago, and it is continuing to decrease as its mission nears completion. We do not see how the temporary presence of U.S. troops in China would cause international friction."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding Stalin's statement on the 23rd and Gromyko's proposal in the Security Council, which argued that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China was necessary for maintaining world peace, this reporter visited relevant authorities on the 25th. According to their spokesperson, Chairman Stalin's statement was frank and sincere and believed to be beneficial to the future of world peace. Regarding the stationing of U.S. troops in China, both China and the U.S. have clarified its legal basis and dispelled various rumors. In fact, the U.S. military is gradually withdrawing from China as its mission concludes, and the timing of the complete withdrawal is only a matter of time. The spokesperson also stated that they had learned that the Security Council had rejected Gromyko's proposal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Mr. Connors, the press officer of the U.S. Embassy, stated on the 25th that the Soviet representative's criticism in the Security Council of the U.S. military's presence in China involved diplomatic issues, and any comments should be issued by Washington. The embassy had "no official statement" on the matter. Regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Mr. Connors said that the U.S. military was gradually withdrawing from China, and the U.S. military facilities in Shanghai would be closed by the end of the month. In the future, only the U.S. military advisory group would remain in China, and that organization was staying at the invitation of the Chinese government. As for the Marine Corps, they were responsible for transportation and other work, which was different from the army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Chinese political figures said regarding Stalin's statement that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China was necessary for maintaining world peace, and Soviet Representative Gromyko's attack on the U.S. military's presence in China at the United Nations Security Council, that the Soviet Union, with the peace talks in China at a hopeless deadlock and the Chinese Communists encountering major oppression on all fronts, had finally openly provided diplomatic support to the Chinese Communists, revealing its sharp edge. Foreign Ministry officials stated that the recent organized attacks by the Soviet Union on U.S. policy toward China, especially regarding the stationing of U.S. troops in China, were an inevitable development. The same sources also pointed out that Zhou Enlai's withdrawal from the Nanjing peace talks, the "Withdrawal from China Propaganda Week" in the United States, and the instigation by leftists to stop one-sided aid to the National Government and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, were all consistent with the Soviet Union's planned actions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 25th] Following the Soviet representative to the Security Council raising the issue of the presence of U.S. troops in China, apart from the government feeling uneasy that the Soviet Union had unduly interfered in the rights of a sovereign state, there was no explosive reaction. The Soviet Embassy and the Chinese Communist delegation seemed unaware of the development. An official at the Soviet Embassy said that the Kremlin had not given any instructions to the embassy in China. Liao Chengzhi, a spokesperson for the Chinese Communists, said that the matter was quite important and had been telegraphed to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. He did not intend to express any other opinions, only hoping that President Truman's declaration in December of last year and the Moscow declaration of the three powers could guarantee peace in the Far East. As for Marshal Ma's headquarters, there was still no response.</p>
<p>[United News, Nanjing, 25th] Central spokesperson Wang Bingnan hosted a press conference today, criticizing Soviet Representative Gromyko's remarks in the Security Council regarding the China issue. It was said that the remarks were intended to point out that the U.S. military's presence in China was no longer necessary because the U.S. military's mission in China had come to an end. Some people believe that Gromyko's remarks were the prelude to the Soviet Union's active involvement in Chinese affairs, to which Wang declined to comment. However, he said that Gromyko had his reasons for making such remarks and that the Chinese Communists had not considered bringing the China issue to the United Nations Security Council for resolution. (For more on the Security Council's discussion of the U.S. military in China, please see page 3.)</p>

<h3>Zhou Xuechang, Traitor, Tried in Nanjing; Admits "Virtuous Governance" was Wrong; Audience Shouts "Shoot Zhou Xuechang"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Zhou Xuechang, the traitorous mayor of the puppet capital, was tried in the second courtroom of the Capital High Court at 4:30 PM on the 25th, presided over by Judge Wang Hongquan. Due to the large number of audience members and disorder, the trial was temporarily moved to the first courtroom. When the courtroom was changed, someone shouted "Shoot Zhou Xuechang," but Zhou Xuechang remained calm. At 5:00 PM, Zhou Xuechang, wearing a gray robe, black satin casual shoes, and white socks, Zhou confessed: He was from Tianjin. He divorced his original wife in 1940, but the procedures were not completed. His second wife was Yang Xichen, whom he secretly met in prison after being the mayor of the puppet capital. When going from Chongqing to Shanghai, he originally intended to go to Hebei to fight guerrilla warfare, but he was arrested by Li Shiqun, a puppet agent. He was released after Zhou Fohai rescued him and joined the puppet organization. He said that Zhou Fohai dragged him into it and said: "I thought the government could be puppet, but the party and the people could not be puppet. Therefore, at the invitation of Zhou Fohai, I served as the deputy secretary-general of the Central Party Department, hoping to do some things that would benefit the people." He then explained that the existence of the East Asia League did not recruit members and did not work. As for the "virtuous governance," "requisition of labor," and "donation of scrap iron" during his tenure as a puppet mayor, he said that when the enemy and the puppets were in power, he used the powerlessness and courage of the puppet municipal government to resolve some "reconstruction" work caused by the enemy's coercion. As a result of his efforts, this type of situation did not occur again in the second half of his tenure as a puppet mayor. In addition, he explained that at the time, he thought that as long as it was "beneficial" and "contributing" to the people, he would do it, but now he knows that it was wrong. The judge announced that Zhou would be remanded in custody until the trial resumed at 5:00 PM on the 27th. Zhou Jian, 45 years old, graduated from Peking University. In 1939, he served as the head of Shaanxi Education. He was trained in the first session of the Party Training Class of the Central Training Corps. In the spring of 1940, he went to Shanghai and served as the deputy secretary-general of the puppet Central Party Department. In 1941, he was transferred to the puppet Nanjing mayor and echoed the enemy chieftain Lieutenant General Ishiwara Kanji, initiating the East Asia League Movement and advocating the fallacies of Sino-Japanese cooperation and economic cooperation. He also served as the secretary-general of the Nanjing Branch of the East Asia League Association. During his tenure as a puppet mayor, he collected scrap iron and food from the people to help the enemy and abused merchants and civilians.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Situation and the Chinese People - Harriman Succeeds Wallace as U.S. Secretary of Commerce</h3>
<p>Immediately following the Soviet representative's appeal to the United Nations Security Council regarding the situation in China, we see that Stalin, the Soviet leader, also spoke to a reporter from the London Times, stating that the rapid withdrawal of American troops from China is a necessary condition for maintaining peace, providing strong support to the Soviet representative's appearance at the United Nations Security Council. In addition to the part concerning China, Stalin also mentioned the general world situation, especially regarding the handling of defeated Germany and the atomic bomb issue, concluding that "there is no danger of war at present, and any country that wants to start one will certainly not succeed." After the publication of this statement, news reports indicate that it cleared the political air of anxiety in Paris, where the four foreign ministers were gathered. At the same time, former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech in London, strongly urging Britain and the United States to re-engage with the Soviet Union, arguing that the current relations contain an imminent threat of war. Although this has a different purpose than Wallace's speech, it aims to encourage the major powers to increasingly narrow and fill the gap between them and the Soviet Union. The Soviet leader's publication of this statement at this time is of profound significance.</p>
<p>Since the Potsdam Conference, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has gradually shown signs of division. Subsequent developments on the European continent not only failed to heal the rift but, on the contrary, deepened it. Recently, as former British Foreign Secretary Eden stated, it has "contained an imminent threat of war." The consequences caused by Wallace's speech forced him to resign, marking a temporary failure of appeasement towards the Soviet Union. In this sense, Wallace's speech was used by the Kremlin as a probe to gauge the intentions of Britain, the United States, and even the rest of the world. At this time, the Kremlin had probably discerned the direction of the United States, so it had to seize an opportunity to change course with the wind, to prevent the global situation from truly becoming rigid to the point of rupture. Therefore, although British Foreign Secretary Eden believed that there was an "imminent threat of war," the Soviet leader directly stated that "there is no danger of war at present."</p>
<p>Stalin's remarks are undoubtedly a friendly gesture towards Western countries to promote peaceful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western democracies. Given the current rise of "anti-Soviet" sentiment, Stalin's remarks are a wise move. However, when we see that Stalin's proposals include withdrawing American troops from China to maintain world peace and prohibiting the use of atomic bombs to deprive Western countries of a powerful weapon, his attempt to "reconcile" is also attached with conditions, which is that Western countries abandon their positions and stances, and then the Soviet Union may approach them. This is no different from a person holding a knife in one hand, forcing others to respect his opinion, while at the same time shouting, "You guys give up your knives first, and I'll be good to you."</p>
<p>Although this statement is a clever attempt, not everyone is necessarily foolish. Realpolitik is materialistic and also idealistic. After this World War, no one wants another war. In this situation, we have repeatedly pointed out that this gap between the Soviet Union and Western countries should be filled as soon as possible. Since the Soviet Union has made such a friendly gesture, it seems that the door to reconciliation and closer cooperation has been reopened. Breaking the silence of many months and seeking sincere coordination is not necessarily absolutely impossible. What we should pay attention to is whether the Western countries will choose "unconditional surrender" or "conditional compromise." Since Stalin's speech mentioned the situation in China, we must first express our firm opposition to another "Yalta"!</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of American troops from China and the Soviet representative's accusations against the situation in China at the United Nations Security Council, this newspaper has already discussed them in yesterday's article. We must point out again: Gromyko's speech at the Security Council included the deceptive words "an appeal made by a group of prominent figures in China, urging the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs." The appeal of these "prominent figures in China" had to come from the mouth of the Soviet representative, which greatly questions the status and value of these "prominent figures in China" in the eyes of the Chinese people. These "prominent figures in China" in the Soviet representative are no different from the "upper-class Chinese" during the era when Western imperialism dominated China. Only with these figures has the situation in China been forcibly pulled into the scope of international issues. In today's emerging international situation, we want to appeal to all patriotic people in the country to prioritize the nation-state, express our legitimate opinions on national affairs, and especially express our legitimate views on the temporary presence of American troops in China at this time, so that the whole world knows whether the Chinese people can be manipulated.</p>
<h3>Harriman Succeeds Wallace as U.S. Secretary of Commerce</h3>
<p>After the resignation of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, President Truman has appointed Ambassador to Britain Harriman as his successor. After receiving the appointment, Harriman gave a speech in London, saying: "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join President Truman's cabinet as Secretary of Commerce. I was one of the most active members during the time of the late President Roosevelt and served as chairman of the Commerce Department's Douglas Advisory Committee, so I am familiar with the duties of the Commerce Department. At the same time, in the last six or seven years, I have represented the late President Roosevelt and President Truman, stationed in various countries overseas, and have been able to directly learn about the serious economic problems faced by the people of Europe and Asia. People of all countries have great expectations for the United States, hoping that the United States can provide assistance and leadership in morality. I personally fully support the foreign policy adopted by President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes and am continuing to work hard in accordance with the noble principles and goals revealed by the late President Roosevelt. This is the road to peace." After hearing this, the doubts and speculations caused by Wallace's resignation can all be dispelled.</p>
<p>Wallace's speech in New York, involving foreign policy, caused a great uproar in the American political world. Although President Truman decisively made this storm tend to subside, in any case, the occurrence of such an unfortunate dispute at this time is regrettable for President Truman's government. Now, Truman's appointment of Harriman as Secretary of Commerce can be said to be the most suitable candidate in the United States. The rift in the US government caused by Wallace's resignation has also been repaired.</p>
<p>The world is asking the American government after Yeress's departure, "Is President Truman still adhering to the political path of the late President Roosevelt?" At the same time, the opposition attacked President Truman on the grounds of abandoning Roosevelt's policy. However, President Truman's appointment of a successor to Wallace is still a figure who can best understand Roosevelt's ideas, which is enough to prove that the current policy of the United States can still be regarded as a continuation of Roosevelt's policy. As Harriman said, the American government is still working hard to follow the path advocated by Roosevelt and continue to move towards peace.</p>
<p>After Wallace's resignation, some people thought that Wallace advocated "one world," while President Truman chose "one policy," which would create "two worlds" and move further towards a third world war. After careful study, this view can be known to be true in appearance but false in reality. The foreign policy adopted by the U.S. government today is still based on promoting international cooperation and jointly maintaining world peace and prosperity, and does not want to create a situation of confrontation between groups in the international community and cause a crisis of war. Moreover, in terms of the actual situation in the United States, although the United States was the protagonist in determining the outcome of this war, directly participating in the war with its vast manpower and material resources, the United States itself, because of its geographical relationship, has the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as its barriers, and has not become a battlefield of the war. The domestic industry has not only not suffered from the great war, but its production potential has expanded even more than before the war. Once the U.S. war industry returns to its peacetime state, all of its manufactured goods will be more than enough for its own use, and can be exported to foreign countries to meet the needs of other countries, so that the people of all countries after the war can share peace and prosperity with the United States. Therefore, Harriman said: "After the expansion of peacetime production in the United States, in addition to meeting the needs of the people at home, it can also be used as export goods to meet the needs of people in other countries. This is the main foundation for the United States to achieve prosperity and happiness at home. The main foundation for the United States to cooperate with other countries and continuously assist the people of all countries is here; the main foundation for the lasting peace that the people of all countries yearn for is also here."</p>
<p>The sole goal of U.S. foreign policy is to create world peace; and the most difficult problem for American politicians and diplomats is how to live in peace with the Soviet Union. In theory, everyone knows that if the powers after the war want to create world peace, they must rely on the full cooperation of the five major powers: China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France; and everyone also understands that creating peace is even more difficult than winning the war. The real peace cannot be realized unless the powers cooperate with the spirit of fighting shoulder to shoulder in wartime and sharing life and death. But in reality, how to eliminate the differences in thinking among the powers? How to reconcile the conflicts of interest among the powers? How to dispel the suspicion that is growing deeper and deeper due to mutual misunderstanding? These are all serious problems. Secretary Harriman has served as an envoy to Moscow and is very familiar with the political situation in the Soviet Union. In the future, he will definitely make contributions to the government's policy towards the Soviet Union. It is expected that economic interests will be one of the important determining factors in the evolution of international relations after the war. Therefore, the views of the head of the U.S. Department of Commerce also have considerable influence on the determination of its foreign policy.</p>

<h3>Committee on Treaty with Italy Passes Three Articles Concerning China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] The Committee on Italian Politics and Territory today discussed Articles 18, 19, and 20 of the Treaty with Italy, all of which concern China, and passed them unanimously. The three articles are stipulated as follows: "Article 18" Italy renounces all benefits and privileges enjoyed in China under the 1901 treaty, and all annexes to the treaty are invalidated.

<h3>Security Council Rejects Soviet Proposal - Chinese Representative States that the Stationing of U.S. Troops in China Was Approved in Advance by the Chinese Government</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 24th] The Soviet Union had proposed that the Security Council include on its agenda the issue of requiring all countries to report on their overseas troop deployments, but it was recently rejected by the United Nations Security Council by a vote of seven to two. France and Egypt abstained, and Poland supported the Soviet proposal. The Security Council then adjourned in its entirety. It is scheduled to reconvene this Thursday, at which time a closing ceremony will be held and the issue of reporting to the United Nations General Assembly will be considered. The Egyptian representative pointed out during the meeting that Egypt is currently negotiating with the British side on the withdrawal of British troops. If the negotiations fail, Egypt will resolutely appeal to the Security Council.</p>
<p>Chinese Representative Xia Jinlin claimed that the stationing of troops by the United Kingdom and the United States in various countries had been approved by the governments of those countries and should not be considered a threat to peace. The request made by the Soviet representative has no basis in the provisions of the United Nations Charter and will not cause international friction. As for the stationing of U.S. troops in China, it has been approved by the Chinese government, and the U.S. troops have the task of cooperating with the Chinese government. Moreover, the United States has never interfered in China's internal affairs. Once its mission is completed, the U.S. troops will leave China, and this matter should be decided by the Chinese and American governments themselves. The Polish representative supported the Soviet Union's request, saying that the Security Council should not deny any member state the right to express its opinions. The U.S. representative replied that his delegation's records showed that the United States was willing to discuss various proposals, the more the better, but he regretted that the Soviet Union had not followed the provisions of the Charter and raised this issue through the appropriate channels with the governments concerned. He continued that his country had nothing to hide and that the locations where U.S. troops were stationed could be learned from newspapers. The Soviet representative reiterated his previous accusations, saying that since the Security Council has the power to take measures to maintain world peace, it certainly has the power to gather information.</p>
<h3>Soviet People Greatly Relieved After Stalin Indicates National Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] After newspapers and radio stations announced Stalin's remarks, indicating that there was no real danger of war, the residents of Moscow felt relaxed and satisfied, and the fear of war was eliminated by Stalin's words. This morning, a large crowd waited at newspaper distribution stations for the announcement of early newspapers. After reading them, they all uttered a "good" and then turned away. Purchasers of newspapers lined up in long queues, waiting patiently, a situation that can be described as rare. The Soviet people have complete trust in Stalin. If Stalin says "there is no war," the people are convinced that there is no war. Recently, the Soviet people have felt uneasy about war, even using old superstitious ideas to prove the normality of their uneasy state. For example, a large number of mushrooms recently arrived in Moscow. An old saying goes, "A good mushroom harvest means war is inevitable," so the people were even more convinced that war would inevitably happen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Acting Secretary of State Says Stalin's Remarks Are Worth Pondering</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] When Acting Secretary of State Clayton received reporters today, he was asked for his opinion on Soviet leader Stalin's remarks to a British reporter. Clayton replied that Stalin's statement that he did not believe there was a crisis of any new war and that the atomic bomb should be banned as a weapon was worth pondering and of great importance. In addition, regarding Soviet Representative Gromyko's statement at the Security Council that the presence of U.S. troops in China, Brazil, Iceland, and Panama had caused uneasiness in those countries, Clayton commented on this statement, saying that it was not in line with the facts and that the presence of U.S. troops in various countries had not caused uneasiness.</p>
<h3>Thorough Reorganization of U.S. Navy Personnel</h3>
<p>Four Admirals Retire</p>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The United States announced today the most thorough reorganization of the naval command since the end of the war, with a total of four admirals retiring. When issuing this announcement, the Navy Department emphasized that this change was in line with the department's policy of rotating senior officers to enable them to continuously gain new experience. Vice Admiral Denfield replaced Admiral Towers as Commander of the Pacific Fleet and the Pacific Area. Vice Admiral Blandy, who was responsible for the atomic bomb tests, took over the Eighth Fleet, which is now part of the Atlantic Fleet. Rear Admiral Holloway, Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel Management, will take over as Superintendent of the Annapolis Naval Academy after Vice Admiral Fitch retires in January next year. Vice Admiral Cochrane, Chief of the Bureau of Ships, will become Chief of Materiel in November, succeeding Admiral Moreell, who announced his retirement last week. Vice Admiral Mills will take over Cochrane's former position. Rear Admiral Johnson, Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel Management, will take over as Chief of Publications after Vice Admiral Carpenter retires in November.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The British cabinet will be reorganized next week. The only female cabinet member, Education Minister Wilkinson, will be reassigned to a lighter post or even retire completely due to health reasons. Army Minister Lawson will leave office for the same reason. The rumor that Commerce Minister Cripps will resign is considered groundless in political circles.</p>
<h3>Truman Announces Campaign Platform - Seeking Peace as the Basis - Warns the People Not to Ignore the Current Crisis - Wallace Returns to the Democratic Party Camp</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Thirty-nine Democratic candidates for Congressmen visited the White House today to meet with the party leader, President Truman, who delivered a speech on the spot, saying: The crisis we are currently encountering is the same as the one that existed before the Pearl Harbor incident. In fact, this crisis has existed since the end of World War II. This crisis will continue to exist until peace is achieved and peacetime production is restored. The Democratic Party's platform is to seek world peace and universal support for production plans. Apart from this, the United States has no other demands. If the platform drafted by the Democratic Party in 1944 were implemented, there would be no unemployment problem in the country. As for the Republican Party's platform, its drafters aim to obstruct congressional proceedings. The difficulties of the current situation are partly due to the obstructive tactics of these Republicans.</p>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: After President Truman announced that Democratic members would seek world peace and increase production in the election this November, recently dismissed Commerce Secretary Wallace returned to the Democratic Party's camp today. It is reported that he has agreed to support "recommended" Democratic members in future elections, which will greatly help the Democratic Party win.</p>
<h3>Soviet Soldiers Seek Trouble with Guns in the American Sector of Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] In the American sector of Berlin last night, American military police attempted to stop the movement of a German truck, but were blocked by five Soviet soldiers with guns. Shortly after, a joint American-Soviet patrol military police force passed by and fired a Thompson gun into the sky, and the Soviet soldiers fled. The Berlin Military Court announced that three Soviet soldiers had surrendered themselves and were temporarily held by the American authorities, while the other two escaped. It is reported that within the past week, dozens of Soviet officers and soldiers also threatened the American military police with guns, attempting to rob two suspected traitors.</p>
<h3>Korean Communist Party's Anti-American Conspiracy - U.S. Intercepts Official Documents</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] U.S. military authorities announced today that they had intercepted official documents from the Korean Communist Party, entitled "Propaganda and Struggle Plan for September," which plotted to expel U.S. troops from southern Korea while welcoming the Red Army from the north.</p>
<h3>World War III: Jews Will Unite Against Communism</h3>
<p>Truman Issues Statement to Jews</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th - A broadcast from a secret radio station by the Stern Gang organization today stated: In the workers' war, Jews will unite against the British. This broadcast expressed sympathy for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman issued a special statement of congratulations for the Jewish New Year, September 26th, which stated in part: "As the United States and other Allied nations strive to lay the foundation for lasting world peace, we are pleased to celebrate the Jewish New Year. I extend my sincere congratulations to my fellow citizens of the Jewish faith. Only when all people, regardless of race, language, and religious belief, jointly strive for human rights, can the foundation for lasting world peace be laid. To achieve this goal, the peace conference is currently discussing various issues and formulating treaties to guarantee freedom of speech, assembly, and belief for all humanity. This freedom is a legacy of civilization for centuries, and we all have a responsibility to promote its glory."</p>
<h3>Indigenous Rebellion in Iran: Fierce Fighting in the South; Negotiations in Azerbaijan Postponed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 24th] A rebellion has broken out in southern Iran and is still spreading. Government forces and rebels engaged in fierce fighting in the city of Kaserun this morning. (Kaserun is near Isfahan, the former capital of Iran.) Government forces in the Bushehr region were forced to retreat two kilometers. Reinforcements landed at various ports in the Persian Gulf this morning. A mechanized unit of the government forces is advancing towards Shiraz, but has not yet entered the city. It is reported that the city is relatively calm, but prices have gradually increased in recent days, and residents are deeply afraid of famine, so they gather in mosques to pray. Prime Minister Sultaneh spoke with Lurs of Khuzestan via radio today, stating that he is studying their demands and inviting rebel leaders to Tehran for a meeting to discuss all of their demands. The negotiations between the central government and representatives of Azerbaijan Province have been decided to be postponed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 24th] Iranian indigenous rebels have occupied several villages in the Persian Gulf. Indigenous leaders suddenly sent a telegram to Prime Minister Sultaneh today, making certain demands. The Prime Minister announced that he would respond.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] Senior Iranian military officials denied that the city of Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast has been occupied by the Qashqai tribe, and stated that rumors of the Azerbaijani democratic forces taking the opportunity to advance on the capital are also groundless. The spokesperson said that although the government has sent troops to Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Gorgan, the military strength in the capital is still sufficient to deal with any emergency.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 24th] One hundred and seventy trucks carrying Iranian government troops, tanks, and aircraft departed for southern Iran to rescue the city of Shiraz, which is surrounded by tribes. Reliable sources say that the Qashqai tribe has about 20,000 people, with sophisticated weapons, including rifles, machine guns, and recoilless rifles. The situation in Tehran is calm, and people are confident that Prime Minister Sultaneh is capable of handling all crises. It is reported that various tribes in southern Iran have successively joined the Qashqai tribe.</p>
<h3>Inventor of the Tank, Swinton, Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Sir Ernest Swinton, the inventor of the tank, passed away at his home in Lincoln today at the age of seventy-one. The first tank was built in 1915, when he was an agricultural machinery expert. The Admiralty asked him to design a tractor to tow naval guns, and his "Mother of Tanks" was highly praised by the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.</p>
<h3>Greek King to Depart Today, Leaving England to Return to His Homeland</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 25th - Broadcasting from London: Londoners believe that King George of Greece will fly to Malta on the "York" aircraft tomorrow morning or afternoon, and then transfer to a Greek minesweeper to return home. However, the King of Greece's personal intentions have not yet been confirmed by those around him.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the King will be accompanied on this trip by his Prime Minister, Konstantinos Tsaldaris, and several important members of his entourage.</p>
<h3>British Military Headquarters in Egypt to Relocate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 24th] The British military headquarters in Egypt has moved from here to an area near Ismailia last week. The British Middle East Command will also move from here to the Suez Canal area before December of this year.</p>
<h3>Americans Lack Meat; Slaughterhouses Hoard Pigs and Sheep</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 24th] The United States is experiencing the biggest meat shortage in history today. Cities across the country are suffering from a lack of meat. This is due to slaughterhouses hoarding pigs and sheep in anticipation of the Office of Price Administration raising price limits. The meat supply in September is only half of that in June. After the reduction in meat supply, approximately 15,000 workers in the canned meat industry have no work to do. Other industries such as leather, lard, and soap are also greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese-German Behind-the-Scenes Diplomacy Before Germany Launched War Against Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Revealed in the Notes of Former War Criminal Matsuoka</p>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 25th] The defense for the Far East International Military Tribunal today requested that former German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, be brought to court for cross-examination, but the request was rejected by the presiding judge. The prosecution today continued to present various pieces of evidence, including records of conversations between Matsuoka and Stahmer, which stated: In September 1940, the German special envoy to Japan, Stahmer, along with Ambassador Ott, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and expressed: (1) Germany hopes that this war will not expand into a global war and does not want the United States to participate; (2) Germany does not request military assistance from Japan, but hopes to restrain the United States and prevent its participation in the war; (3) The only way to prevent war between Japan and the United States and between Germany and the United States is for Japan, Germany, and Italy to establish an understanding or agreement and demonstrate a firm attitude; (4) Germany recognizes and assists Japan's political leadership in East Asia; (5) Approaching the Soviet Union will be beneficial after the Japan-Germany-Italy agreement, and Germany is prepared to mediate the issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. In addition, on January 31, 1941, Ott sent an urgent telegram to the German Foreign Minister stating: Because the world situation is in a stalemate, the Japanese side is currently working to threaten the United States. Finally, the Shiratori and other action factions advocate defensive attacks on Singapore. This attack is indeed promising, but if it turns into a long-term economic war, it will be unfavorable to Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Defense attorney Cunningham said today: Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union's actions in the Far East have given Japanese major war criminals such as Tojo more opportunities to be released than at the end of the war. The events that have occurred since Japan's surrender at least prove that the fears of the Japanese are partly accurate and justified. He told a United Press reporter that the Soviet Union's activities in the Northeast, in fact, proved Japan's fear of Soviet aggression, which was closely related to the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance. In a section of his report entitled "The Soviet Union's Status as an International Criminal," he wrote, "How can we reconcile the judicial system of Moscow with the judicial system of democratic countries?"</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Declares Support: India Should Be Free and United</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 25th - Broadcasting from New Delhi: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha declared his support for a "free and united India." This statement has aroused great attention in New Delhi and among the Congress Party. It is believed here that the Egyptian Prime Minister's statement on a "united India" is tantamount to a formal condemnation of the partition of India. Sidky's views are of great importance in Islamic countries, and it is not yet known whether other Islamic countries also agree with this view. The Allied side is currently maintaining silence.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Sends Troops to the Dutch East Indies; People Strike in Opposition</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 24th] Workers here are opposing the government's dispatch of troops to the Dutch East Indies to suppress the revolutionary movement, and have launched a general strike. Streetcars, buses, railways, and port transportation in the city have all stopped. Printing factories have also stopped working. Police authorities have taken various precautions to prevent communist troublemaking.</p>
<h3>Global Labor Unrest Roundup</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Two public utility workers in Amsterdam have launched a general strike to protest the Dutch army's opening of the Dutch East Indies. For the third time in seven months, an electricity strike has occurred in the United States, affecting steel factories and various industries in Pittsburgh and Bethlehem. Five thousand oil workers in Sarawak, Borneo, have also gone on strike in protest of the small amount of rice rations allocated to their families. Although customs officials in France have resumed work, the union still claims that it will strike again if the government does not keep its promises.</p>
<h3>The Riddle of the Middle East (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— By Bartley Crum; Translated and Abridged by Wenhao</p>
<p>The Oil Problem</p>
<p>However, the oil problem cannot be ignored. More than 95% of the oil in the Middle East, whether already extracted or still in reserves, is in the hands of British and American corporations. But recently, the Soviet Union and Iran concluded an agreement to exploit oil in northern Iran, which will inevitably have a significant impact. Although the benefits that the British and Americans give to oil-producing countries are already greater than in the past, it is unheard of for a country like Russia to be willing to share the profits equally with the oil-owning country. This event will not only cause Arab countries and Iran to demand amendments to previous oil agreements with the British and American corporations, but may also affect other oil-producing countries in Asia, such as Indonesia.</p>
<p>Arab Nationalism</p>
<p>In order to maintain its position in the Middle East, Britain has recently been making overtures to Arabs and Muslims both within and outside the empire.</p>
<p>During the two world wars, a fiery spirit of nationalism swept into the hearts of many Arabs. The slogan of "political and geographical integration" became widespread. They first planned to merge a small number of countries, and finally to merge all Arab-speaking countries together. However, due to the complexity of their political and social backgrounds, Arabs have always hesitated about this alliance. In addition, there are many other obstacles, such as the League of Nations mandates granted to Britain and France, which include Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq; the hostility between the Saudi royal family and the Hashemite royal family; the unwillingness of Lebanese Christians to join an Arab state; the Palestine problem; and the balance of power policy pursued by Britain in Arab countries, and so on.</p>
<p>Palestine</p>
<p>The British Mandate of Palestine remains a very difficult problem. The Anglo-American Special Committee has recommended the transfer of 100,000 Jews into it, but without allowing the Jews to establish a state there, which has caused both Arabs and Jews to oppose it. Shortly after the Arabs fiercely opposed it, President Truman praised the report. However, as Russian power emerges in West Asia, Britain is more likely to be resented by the Arabs. The Russians have always been unsympathetic to Jewish nationalism, so the Arabs are reaching out to them for help.</p>
<p>The Arab League</p>
<p>After the Arabs realized the impossibility of "political and geographical integration," they devoted themselves to efforts to unify the Arab world, and the result was the establishment of the Arab League, which is composed of many Arab countries and headquartered in Cairo. Initially, its main task was to prevent the expansion of Jewish nationalism and to keep Palestine absolutely under Arab control, but later its scope of work gradually expanded. Due to the consistency of foreign policy and cultural and economic ties, the cornerstone of Arab unity is gradually taking shape. This league may become a latent force of Islam, and its power has already expanded beyond the Arab world in the East. Britain is very friendly to this league, so Russia deeply fears that it will become a tool of Britain, although the league earnestly expresses that its purpose is only to protect the interests of the Arab world.</p>
<p>The Condition of the People</p>
<p>What is the condition of the people in the Middle East? During the war, most of their leaders stood on the sidelines, and the general standard of living was better than before the war because they could sell goods and labor to the warring countries. Now that the war is over, the general public deeply feels the pain of life again. But their eyes are focused on labor rights and social reform. Most intellectuals are focusing their efforts on overthrowing the conservative system. Communists and leftists are small in number, but well-organized and resolute in their attitude.</p>
<p>Although Americans mostly abhor British imperialism, they support British policies because they believe that Britain is their first line of defense.</p>
<p>The situation of most of the people in the Middle East is very dire. Although several modern agricultural and industrial designs are being studied to solve the livelihoods of the general public, these plans are usually in the hands of conservatives, and these conservatives are only concerned with their own interests, not the happiness of the general public.</p>
<p>Of course, the Russians are by no means unprepared. Like the British and Americans, they have active agents all over the Middle East. The power of the British and Americans rests on the bourgeoisie, while Russia excels at agitating the dissatisfaction of the general public.</p>
<p>There is an Arab proverb that says, "When the sea winds fight, the sailors benefit." If the blind forces of the Middle East finally erupt into war, we wonder whether the sailors, who symbolize humanity, will be able to survive this time. (The End)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, rarely attends public banquets, especially in Shanghai. This is probably the first time that she and Mrs. Marshall have attended a reception together.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of American women for Madame Chiang Kai-shek is no less than that of the Chinese themselves. At yesterday's grand reception held by the Lizi Society to welcome the members and dependents of the US Military Advisory Group in China, they had a rare opportunity to see Madame Chiang Kai-shek's elegant demeanor. It is not surprising that when reporters told several American ladies, "Madame Chiang Kai-shek will also be attending today's reception," they were extremely excited and immediately spread the word to everyone. An American military officer said, "I have been in China for two years and haven't seen her once. I really want to see her." Indeed, this welcome reception did not disappoint them. The two ladies smiled throughout the hour they were in attendance. Although our new friends feel unfamiliar with China in many ways, they fully expressed their harmonious and happy feelings at yesterday's reception. We firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States will be further enhanced.</p>
<p>The first batch of American military dependents numbered more than one hundred. The Lizi Society has prepared nine reception centers for them. The Jin Shenfu Road 118, where yesterday's welcome reception was held, is the second reception center. This is a magnificent building with a beautiful and spacious garden, originally the residence of Shanghai "celebrity" Sheng Laosan. It was taken over by the municipal government in May of this year and prepared for the mayor to live in, but the mayor and his wife thought the house was too extravagant and did not want it, so it was handed over to the Lizi Society. After taking over, the Lizi Society slightly tidied it up and planned to reserve it for Marshal Marshall, but Marshal Marshall has not lived there to this day. Mrs. Marshall must have found this residence particularly interesting when she came to this residence for the first time yesterday. This house is now prepared for the dependents of several other senior generals. Although the reception centers of the Lizi Society are all very well-appointed, there are some differences, which can only be allocated according to rank.</p>
<p>Welcome Reception Begins</p>
<p>The welcome reception started at 3:00 p.m. To the sound of pleasant music, the elderly and young wives and children of the American military gradually walked into the building. Several young women from the YWCA helped to receive them and guide them to visit the upstairs and downstairs. Unfortunately, most of the antiques from the "Sheng Mansion" have been moved away, and some of the remaining small items are not particularly wonderful. However, the photographs of President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife hanging on the walls of the garden corridor attracted all the guests, and at the same time, admiring voices such as "She is so beautiful" were constantly heard.</p>
<p>When about a hundred guests had arrived, the "finding peanuts" program began. This was only allowed for the wives and children. After the command "Start" was given, the old, the young, the brightly dressed, the plainly dressed wives and young ladies, and the lively and innocent children all scattered on the lawn to grope for peanuts. After the "Stop" command was given, the judges checked the number of peanuts. As a result, Mrs. White won the first prize with one hundred and eighty-one peanuts. There were also three other prizes.</p>
<p>The snacks served to the guests at yesterday's tea party were all Chinese pastries, including water chestnut cake, egg tarts, candied lotus root, siu mai, and candied lotus seeds. The American wives who had never tasted these Chinese pastries were all interested in them.</p>
<p>The Two Ladies Arrive; Applause Breaks Out</p>
<p>At 4:30 p.m., Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Mrs. Marshall stepped into the garden amidst the eager waiting of everyone. After a round of enthusiastic applause, there was silence. Curious and admiring eyes were all focused on Madame Chiang Kai-shek, but Mrs. Marshall's Chinese cheongsam made of yellow-green silk with coffee-colored flowers immediately attracted everyone's attention again. The style of Mrs. Marshall's cheongsam was exactly the same as Madame Chiang Kai-shek's cheongsam made of black silk with red and green flowers. That was because they were both made by Madame Chiang Kai-shek's tailor. The only difference was that Madame Chiang Kai-shek wore a black and gray short velvet coat and black goatskin high heels, while Mrs. Marshall wore a short yellow wolf fur coat and yellow-green glass high heels. Reporters had long heard that Mrs. Marshall looked even more beautiful in Chinese cheongsam than in Western clothing, and upon seeing her, they indeed felt the same way.</p>
<p>After the two ladies sat down at the long table in the center, they were accompanied by Mrs. Gilan, Mrs. Bingke, Mrs. Mayor Wu, and several others.</p>
<p>Then, Director-General Huang Renlin walked to the microphone and delivered a speech, stating briefly that China is extremely grateful for the assistance of the American military in fighting alongside China. We have decided to do our best to welcome the American military dependents and make them comfortable and convenient. However, after the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, China feels the lack of everything and is facing difficulties. If there are any shortcomings in the reception, we hope everyone will forgive us.</p>
<p>In addition to inviting the American guests to enjoy Chinese pastries, Director-General Huang also introduced Pan Yuzhen's technical performance. The guests all expressed great satisfaction, and the children especially clapped and cheered. An female member of the Pan family performed the plate spinning. She was particularly wonderful. After the performance, Madame Chiang Kai-shek specially summoned her to examine the stick used for spinning the plate and asked her to perform again on the tower. Unfortunately, that plate was not their own, so after trying twice, it still did not work. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek saw that the young lady's face was splashed with water due to the wind, she specially took a piece of paper and told her to "wipe her eyes." Xiao Pengfei's magic performance also won applause from the entire audience. That little friend was very familiar with this trick. When he saw them breaking the eggs and pouring them into a hat, he said, "A chicken will appear in a while." However, this time the magician did not conjure up a chicken, but a plate of noodles. After a while, when he saw the card tricks, he told the reporter again, "In a while, the cards will slowly shrink." Sure enough, he was right.</p>
<p>Impressions of Shanghai</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m., the end of the reception was announced. The two Madame Chiangs walked into the reception room to wait for each guest to be formally introduced, shake hands, and say goodbye. Therefore, the guests walked along the way saying, "This is a very interesting gathering. We feel very happy."</p>
<p>Finally, let us listen to what our new friends think of China. After the reporter talked with several wives, they all said, "We like China very much." One Mrs. Gober said, "When we left the United States, my friends were very jealous of us because they also wanted to come." Another wife said, "I grew up in Washington, D.C., and have always thought that Washington, D.C. is the most crowded city, but I didn't expect Shanghai to be even more crowded than Washington, D.C." Most of the wives and young ladies were unable to express their impressions of Shanghai because they had only arrived a few days ago and had not had the opportunity to browse this metropolis. The new friends unanimously felt that the difficult thing was that they did not understand Chinese, and it was simply inexplicable to buy things. A fifteen-year-old young lady who was about to attend American school told the reporter very sincerely, "I must learn Chinese, at least so that it is easier to call a rickshaw."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the arrival of the American wives and young ladies in Shanghai will attract everyone's attention, especially for their new 1946 fashion, but in fact they are already complaining endlessly. One wife told the reporter that there are very few banquets and social engagements in the United States now. Each person can only buy one pair of leather shoes. Before leaving, she repeatedly negotiated with the shoe store, saying that she was about to come to China and also because she was a regular customer, so they allowed her to buy an additional pair. They were already envious of yesterday's grand banquet!</p>

Among those attending the medal presentation ceremony were Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. Bludworth, Lieutenant General Gillem and his wife, General Chennault, and Chief Secretary Huang Renlin. Madame Chiang stated that General Bludworth was about to leave China and return to the United States, so she was representing the Chairman to present the medal on this occasion, personally placing the grand medal around General Bludworth's neck and offering congratulations. After General Bludworth received the medal, Mrs. Bludworth stepped forward to kiss him in celebration, and the guests raised their glasses in congratulation. After the ceremony, Madame Chiang accompanied the guests to the private residence of H.H. Kung for a dinner party.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Madame Chiang is scheduled to return to Nanjing this afternoon with Mrs. Marshall and her entourage.</p>

<h3>Two French Postal Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>The French postal ship company's China-Vietnam route had two ships that once transported rice to Shanghai last month. After returning to Vietnam, there has been no news. It is reported that the first ship on the China-France route, the Sonsay, has already departed from Marseille and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month, carrying a large number of overseas Chinese returning home. The second ship, the André Lebon, is scheduled to depart from Marseille for China in mid-October. It is planned that there will be one ship per month on the China-France route, and unless there are special changes, the sailing schedule can be confirmed. It is also reported that the S.S. Sommerwerff, managed by Shun Heng Yang, has arrived at Wusongkou with a large quantity of gasoline from the United States, and will be able to enter the port and unload tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3>Yongxu and Yongxiang to be Received Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will receive two more tankers today, named Yongxu and Yongxiang. The previously received Yongfei tanker has been dispatched to Tianjin to transport oil products for the China Petroleum Corporation and is currently being loaded. As for the Haihui, a ship purchased by the Materials Supply Bureau in Canada, it has been received by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The Haining, which is loaded with lumber, has not yet been completely unloaded, so the acceptance will have to wait. The third ship, the Haihang, is also expected to arrive in Shanghai this Saturday, reportedly carrying a large batch of railroad ties, estimated at 20,000. Once the cargo is unloaded, it will be received by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<h3>Flying Across the Pacific: Opening Two Air Routes; Starting Point Shanghai, End Point San Francisco; Sino-U.S. Authorities to Sign Agreement Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sino-U.S. authorities are about to sign an agreement to open trans-Pacific air routes between China and the United States. The routes will start in Shanghai and end in San Francisco, divided into north and south routes. The southern route will pass through Xian Island, Wake Island, Honolulu, and other places, operated by Central Air Transport Corporation. The northern route will pass through Japan and other Pacific islands, as well as Alaska, operated by China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>Negotiations were initiated several months ago by the U.S. commercial aviation sector. Three companies, including Continental, Pan American, and Northwest, plan to establish round-the-world flights via Shanghai using Constellation aircraft and other four-engine aircraft. The U.S. State Department officially dispatched Colonel Powell as a representative to China to negotiate with the Chinese Ministry of Transportation. As a result of weeks of negotiations, the Ministry of Transportation has instructed Central and China National Aviation Corporation to formulate detailed plans for the two routes so that flights can begin as soon as the agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Currently, both Central and China National Aviation Corporation lack suitable aircraft for trans-Pacific flights. Central currently has only C46 and C47 small aircraft, which are not suitable for long-distance overwater flights, so it plans to purchase giant aircraft such as the Stratocruiser from the United States. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered C54 four-engine aircraft, which are expected to arrive soon.</p>

Subsequently, Liu Hongsheng expressed several opinions: (1) dredging the Huangpu River to alleviate ship congestion; (2) preventing wharf theft requires clear division of responsibilities; (3) utilizing the spacious warehouses in Pudong to solve the congestion of warehouses in Puxi. Li Jianhua then stated that the issue of reforming the wharf contracting system had been discussed with the Police and Public Works Bureaus several times, and it was intended to abolish the contracting system. Subsequently, Fang Zhichao offered opinions on preventing wharf theft: (1) sampans are not allowed to approach before the ship docks at the wharf; (2) if theft is discovered, report to the police immediately; (3) install petition police on each ship. Finally, Mayor Wu announced that the Port Committee will be formally established on October 1, and the office will be located at the original site of the National Government Audit Office. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Three Red Lights Hung High on the Bund: Fifth-Grade Gale Scans Shanghai</h3>
<p>The hurricane in the Pacific Ocean east of Guam on Kruck Island on the 19th had reached the east side of Taiwan by noon yesterday, less than 100 miles offshore, located at 24 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude. It is currently moving rapidly in a west-northwest direction, with a wind force center of 30 miles in diameter and an hourly speed of 18 miles. Shanghai has been disturbed by the leading edge of the hurricane, and the wind is violently strong, measuring at a fifth-grade gale. The Huangpu River is turbulent, and it is also during a high tide, with the tide beginning to come ashore from the Bund. In some low-lying roads, the tide is backflowing from the sewers, flooding the road surface. The Bund Observatory hung the No. 3 wind signal on the roof last night, that is, three consecutive red lights, warning ships sailing to Southeast Asia not to set sail to prevent accidents. All kinds of boats in the Huangpu River have sailed into the harbors to take shelter from the wind, and the traffic on both banks is temporarily stagnant. The Observatory predicts that if the hurricane's direction remains unchanged, it will land on the coast of Fujian at 10:00 AM this morning, so it is predicted that the wind force will continue to increase this morning, and there may be a mixture of oblique wind and drizzle.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Observatory's weather forecast is as follows: Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy to overcast, showers, strong northeasterly wind, heavy waves. Central China, overcast, local showers and morning mist, moderate northerly to easterly wind. Shanghai, haze, to showers, strong northeasterly to easterly wind.

<p>(Another Report) The typhoon that came from the Guam and Saipan area reached eastern Taiwan yesterday afternoon. The wind is fierce. It is possible it will land on the coast between Xinghua and Quanzhou, Fujian at 10:00 AM this morning. The wind will weaken before landing and strengthen after landing, then advance to southern Jiangxi, where it is expected to dissipate and not attack Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Central Meteorological Bureau issued a typhoon warning saying: This typhoon formed on the 18th in the Caroline Islands (southeast of Guam) with a central wind speed of 10 grades, traveling northwest very quickly. On the 21st, it passed Guam, and the wind was strongest, with a central wind speed of 61 meters per second and an outer wind force of 10 grades within a diameter of 320 kilometers (strong enough to uproot trees and destroy houses). After that, the momentum weakened slightly, and the speed slowed down. At 1:00 PM on the 25th, it arrived at the southern end of Taiwan and turned west. The speed is 27 kilometers per hour. On the 26th, it will attack the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Accused of Accepting Bribes and Stealing Fingerprint Cards: Incident Exposed, All Arrested, Prosecuted, and Trial Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In December of last year, a certain unit in Shanghai was recruiting members, and one of the requirements was that applicants must not have been subject to criminal penalties, otherwise they would not be allowed to apply. Chen Mingliang and Zhang Jinrong wanted to apply, but because they had committed crimes in the past, their fingerprints were on file with the police. They asked Shi Yunda to ask Wang Heshang (i.e., Wang Zhenting) to find a way to lobby the police to destroy the fingerprint cards. Through the introduction of Fang Maosheng, they met Yin Dunlu, an officer of the third section of the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau. Because Yin specialized in fingerprint identification, they asked him to find a way to steal the fingerprint cards of Chen Mingliang and Zhang Yurong and destroy them. At that time, it was agreed to pay 40,000 yuan in remuneration for each card. After Yin agreed, he stole the two fingerprint cards and handed them to Wang Heshang. The incident was discovered by the second section of the bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, and the case was solved. In addition, Zhang Shaoliang had committed more than 20 crimes in the past. After the victory, because he wanted to obtain a car driver's license, he also entrusted someone to steal his fingerprint card from the police bureau for a price of more than 300,000 yuan in counterfeit currency. The card was discovered by a plainclothes police officer while searching pedestrians' pockets and was taken back to the police bureau. Yin Dunlu, Shi Yunda, Chen Mingliang, Zhang Jinrong, and Zhang Shaoliang were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The trial began at the District Court yesterday. Wang Heshang is still at large. After the court inquired, it ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhu Boquan and Others to be Sentenced on the 30th: Huang Zhuan and Tang Deyun Each Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Zhuan, chairman of the former Shanghai Bamboo Industry Association, was found guilty of coercing colleagues to join the association and engaging in enemy support activities. Yesterday, the High Court sentenced him to one year and six months in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for two years. Tang Deyun, a former employee of the Wannuo Trading Company, was found guilty of being a traitor and sentenced to one year and three months in prison and deprived of his civil rights for one year. All property of the two convicts will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families.</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, a prominent figure in Shanghai's financial and business circles during the enemy and puppet period, was finalized by the High Court yesterday and will be sentenced on the 30th of this month. Zhu is currently 48 years old, from Guizhou province, and studied at New York University and Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department, and the chief auditor of the Central Bank. After the puppet regime occupied the concessions, he served as the chairman of the puppet China Industrial Bank, the director of the puppet Jiaotong Bank, a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, a councilor of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, a supervisor of the puppet Central Savings Association, and the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association. In addition, he also served as the manager of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve and presided over the clearing house to promote the puppet currency. He also served as a member of the puppet "Gold Securities" Management Committee, deliberating on gold prices and issuing gold securities. In addition, he held dozens of positions as director and supervisor in various banks, companies, and factories, which led him to resign from his position as the president of the University of Shanghai. He argued in court yesterday that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Jian Xin, a leader in the financial community, sent him a letter from the rear area, asking him to stay in Shanghai and work. He claimed that positions such as the "Gold Securities" Management Committee were purely empty institutions, and the "Gold Securities" were issued by the puppet Central Reserve Bank and had nothing to do with the Management Committee. The other puppet positions were mostly empty names, and the defendant had tried his best to negotiate with the representative of the enemy's Ministry of Finance in Shanghai to unfreeze the deposits of Chinese people frozen in British and American banks, which was of great benefit to depositors. Lawyers Jiang Yiping and Chen Rui defended him.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of Li Hanqing and Xu Senfu, deputy directors of the puppet Silk Tax Bureau's collection office, will also be sentenced on the 30th.</p>
<p>Shen Weiting, chairman of the puppet China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative, was accused of cooperating with the enemy to control the tobacco industry. Witnesses were summoned to court yesterday afternoon, all providing favorable testimony for the defendant. The case was adjourned for further questioning. In addition, the case of Ma Haoqing, the physical education director and Japanese language teacher of the puppet Changshu Jiangsu Provincial Seventh Middle School, was also investigated by questioning witnesses yesterday and ordered to be held in custody for further questioning.</p>
<h3>False Gold Bars: Shi Jin Attempts to Steal Money and Goods: Deceives Young Daughter to Negotiate: Ye Chuansheng Arrested in Minhang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In mid-month, Wu Peizhong (resident at 618 Tanggu Road) and Ye Chuansheng, two timber brokers, offered a large batch of lumber for sale to Senhe Hang at 584 Xinchang Road. The value was considerable, but the payment had not been made. Wu went to Nanjing due to some affairs. Ye suddenly had an evil thought and sneaked into Senhe Hang on the 21st, first collecting 6 million legal tender. He then bought 12 "lead bars" (weighing seven catties and four taels each), wrapped them in newspaper, and pretended they were gold bars. He delivered them to Wu's house. At the time, Wu's wife was out, and only Wu's twelve-year-old daughter was at home. Ye, thinking he could deceive the young girl, falsely claimed: "This is the payment for the lumber. Keep it safe, preferably under the bed, and give it to your father when he returns." The girl, unaware, placed the package in front of the bed. Ye then made up an excuse to coax the girl out. He then stole the package which seemed to have gold bars. An hour later, the girl returned home. Ye asked if the gold bars were there, but she could not find it. The next day, Wu returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and learned of the situation. He intended to find Ye to investigate the truth, but unexpectedly, Ye came to negotiate with Wu, and the two sides had a dispute and parted on bad terms. Wu thought the matter was quite strange, so he reported it to the Hongkou Sub-bureau. The Criminal Investigation Division sent officers to summon Cui Shanxiang, the accountant of Senhe, to inquire whether the payment was in gold bars or cash. He claimed that it was cash. They were about to summon Ye to the case, but he had already fled after hearing the news. He was finally arrested in Minhang yesterday morning and confessed to the attempted embezzlement. He is currently under interrogation.</p>

At the appointed time, a person holding red paper came to contact him. The detectives who had ambushed nearby surrounded him and took him to the police station for interrogation. He confessed that his name was Chu Zude, 17 years old, from Changshu, and lived at 24 Weinan Road, as a neighbor of Du. He was a laborer.

<h3>Each Game More Exciting Than the Last, Qunsheng Team Wins Four Straight, Shantou Team Battles Hard But Unable to Resist</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team's performance is getting better and better, with each game more exciting than the last. Last night, they defeated the Shantou team with a score of 56 to 36, exceeding them by as many as 20 points. In the first half, Qunsheng led 27 to 18. Over two thousand spectators applauded thunderously. Chairman Qian Dajun and senior figures in the sports world, such as Dong Shouyi, were also present to watch.</p>
<p>Absolutely Wonderful</p>
<p>Last night, the Qunsheng team displayed their obstacle offense method, with such skill and seamless execution that, coupled with their well-coordinated teamwork and accurate shooting, they dazzled the audience. The Shantou team initially adopted a solid, steady approach, closely guarding and avoiding any rash moves. However, their skills were insufficient, their ball movement was slightly lacking, and despite fighting hard and giving their best effort, they were ultimately unable to withstand the strong team and succumbed to defeat.</p>
<p>Ten Baskets Behind</p>
<p>Before the game, team captains Chen Jinde and Chen Qingjiang exchanged pennants. Qunsheng started with their five main players: Yang Renhui, Chen Jinde, Yao Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Chen Jinzhi. The Shantou team consisted of He Lide, Liu Jingxing, Chen Qingjiang, Lin Jingcong, and Ji Nankang. From the beginning, the Shantou team focused on securing possession of the ball. Although Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team scored the first point with a free throw, Cai Wenhua immediately responded. Although the Shantou team briefly tied the score at 4-4, Qunsheng then became active, and the situation became tense. In the second quarter, Qunsheng attacked with their most skilled and agile methods. The Shantou team's man-to-man defense gradually crumbled, and Cai Wenhua and Wenzhang frequently scored, putting Qunsheng ahead 27-18 at halftime. In the second half, the Shantou team continued to combine aggression with stability, with Lin Jingcong scoring first from long range. However, Qunsheng soon became active again. Cai Wenhua's unpredictable movements were unparalleled. In desperation, the Shantou team was unable to maintain their consistently steady style of play. Later, Qunsheng substituted Cai Lianke for Cai Wenzhang, and Shantou substituted Zhou Bin for Chen Qingjiang, but the situation remained unchanged. In the end, Qunsheng won by 56 to 36, exceeding them by ten baskets, which was far beyond what was initially expected.</p>

<h3>Yarn Allocation Prices Rise Again by 120,000, Nearly 20,000 Applications, 5,300 Yarn Numbers Allocated, Still Some Yarn Merchants Left Empty-Handed, Middlemen Profiting, Authorities Regret</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, due to the continuous increase in yarn prices, applications for cotton yarn from various parties to the Joint Yarn Sales Committee reached an unprecedented level. It is estimated that private factories applied for approximately 9,000 units, and the China Textile Construction Company (CTCC) applied for approximately 10,000 units, totaling nearly 20,000 units, far exceeding the previous application amount. After discussions at the Sales Committee meeting, the decision was made to sell 20-count cotton yarn at a standard quota of 3,797.5 units for private factories and 1,496.5 units for CTCC (CTCC's information indicates 1,400.5 units). The selling price was set at 1.55 million yuan per 400-pound unit of 20-count cotton yarn. This is an increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous allocation price.</p>
<p>CTCC's cotton yarn was listed for sale yesterday morning, with eight types available. The trading did not start until around 7:00 PM, and sixteen-count to forty-two-count yarns were allocated, mostly to towel factories, dyeing and weaving factories, canvas factories, handicraft weaving factories, and knitting and underwear factories. The selling price was 100,000 to 200,000 yuan higher than the previous period, but still much cheaper than the black market. As for the various yarn merchants, they were completely left empty-handed. The current spot price for 80-count double-strand single-bull-head yarn is 5 million yuan, and the spot price for 60-count three-strand blue phoenix yarn is 3.08 million yuan, which is 300,000 to 500,000 yuan higher than other yarn prices, so no one is importing them, but yarn merchants are slightly taking them in.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the chairman of the Yarn Mill Association, Wang Qiyu, and the deputy general manager of the CTCC, Wu Weijing, told reporters that the application amount was particularly large before this yarn allocation. Based on past application situations, the maximum was only 5,000 to 6,000 units. This time, the application amount was close to 20,000 units, which implies speculation. However, the Sales Committee still allocated to actual users as appropriate. Although the allocation price has increased slightly, it is still 220,000 to 230,000 yuan lower per unit than the market price of 20-count yarn on the same day. It is said that the committee's position is to steadily promote its affairs under the dual prerequisites of implementing the government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the industry. The only concern is that sacrificing the interests of the industry will not benefit the general public, but rather the profit-seeking middlemen.</p>
<p>Actual Sales Become Stronger, Production Decreases Instead</p>
<p>The main reason for the recent increase in yarn prices is said to be that it is the autumn season, actual sales are becoming stronger, and demand has increased sharply. On the one hand, the production conditions of various yarn mills are still severely restricted. In terms of electricity, each factory has to stop production for one day every six days. In addition, the power company sometimes has irregular temporary power outages due to over-limit loads. As a result, an average of more than 300,000 yarn spindles have stopped working in both national and private factories, and some workers have also become unemployed, which will inevitably affect production. Furthermore, the yarn prices in North China have recently risen, with 20-count yarn exceeding 3 million yuan per unit. All of these factors have an impact on yarn prices in this city.</p>
<p>Tianjin and Guangdong Stop Business, Rise Wind Slightly Reduced</p>
<p>Therefore, yesterday's yarn market continued to be strong and trading was still active. Tianjin merchants were not seen taking in, and Guangdong merchants were instead selling out. In principle, the market price should have fallen, but customers from Changjiang Road and Jinpu Line were searching for yarn enthusiastically, with the goal of purchasing 20-count spot goods. Because the price in the inland areas has also increased greatly following the Shanghai market, autumn sales are extremely active, and they do not hesitate to release prices to purchase. The door-to-door sales in this street were also strong, and weaving factories were purchasing a large amount of 42-count double-strand thread. However, around noon, due to foreign banks dumping black market U.S. dollars, the exchange rate returned to the 4,000 yuan level, and gold prices also fell. In addition, the news from Tianjin indicated that yarn prices were trending downward. The exuberant rising momentum in the market was slightly reduced, and the price was not much different from yesterday's market. As the end of the month approached, perhaps due to tight monetary conditions, the public was also deeply cautious. If there are no other changes, the market situation may be able to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Becomes a Buying Frenzy, Grey Cloth Has a Price and Is Immediately Searched For, Without Any Goods Available, Association Announces: Do Not Take the Opportunity to Hoard and Speculate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the cloth market became even more expensive. Purchasers crowded the counters, determined to buy, and manufacturers were willing to pay any price for suitable grey cloth to make up for the shortage. As a result, Dragon Head Fine Cloth was priced but unavailable. Blue V and Wufu were as high as 945,000 yuan, and old goods of Sijunzi Yuan Biji were asking for nearly 110,000 yuan, but there was still a lot of searching. This phenomenon is really due to the thinning of the stock and the simultaneous launch of sales in this street and customer sales, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. However, in the afternoon, the black market exchange rate of U.S. dollars suddenly fell, and money also became tighter, so the price dropped a lot.</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Association issued an emergency notice to its members yesterday afternoon, stating that the recent sharp rise in market prices has affected people's livelihoods. It stated: In the past few days, the financial market has been fluctuating violently, which has affected other prices, all of which have risen in a straight line. Cotton cloth, on the other hand, is in the peak season for autumn sales, and the actual demand is trending strongly. All parties are competing to purchase first, and North merchants are vigorously searching for them. The stock is thin, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. As a result, the price has risen sharply and cannot be contained. This is definitely the trend of the general situation and has nothing to do with human factors. However, this association has the mission of supervising the market and suppressing and stabilizing prices. The association is issuing another earnest notice, hoping that all members will share the difficulties of the times, cooperate to stabilize market prices, and not take the opportunity to hoard and speculate, so as to value business ethics and ensure people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Lun Chang Cotton Cloth Stack's Single Goods Has Signed an Agreement</p>
<p>Regarding the Lun Chang Cotton Cloth Stack's single goods of British merchants who were victims of the robbery, it has been resolved since the Cotton Cloth Association negotiated and mediated. The Single Goods Holders Association has signed an agreement with the British Merchant Lun Chang Association. From today, the single goods holders can take the single goods to the association to handle the accounting and distribution procedures, and then take the single goods to the Lun Chang Stack to pick up the goods.</p>
<h3>CTCC Prevents Hoarding: Overdue Goods Must Pay Warehouse Rent</h3>
<p>To prevent hoarding, the CTCC has made the following regulations for overdue deliveries of cotton yarn totaling two thousand bales previously stored by customers in the company's factories:</p>
<p>(1) All orders issued before the end of August that have not yet been picked up must be picked up within five days (from September 26th to September 30th). Overdue orders will be charged warehouse rent.</p>
<p>(2) Stacked yarn orders issued in September must be picked up within ten days (from September 26th to October 5th). Overdue orders will be charged warehouse rent.</p>
<p>(3) The unit for goods is calculated by the piece. Cotton yarn is calculated at 40 small packages per piece, cloth is calculated at 40 bolts per piece, sacks are calculated at 500 sacks per piece, and woolen cloth is calculated at four large pieces (60 yards per piece) per piece. Units less than one piece will be calculated proportionally. Units exceeding one piece but less than two pieces will also be calculated proportionally. Small numbers beyond one piece, less than one-tenth of a whole piece, may be waived.</p>
<p>(4) Each piece will be charged a warehouse rent of 1,000 national currency for each week it is overdue, 2,000 yuan for the second week, and so on. If it is less than one week, it will be calculated as one week.</p>
<p>(5) Customers must pay the rent and the relevant factory warehouse will issue a receipt as proof. No other fees will be charged.</p>
<h3>Rush to Sell, American Dollars Gradually Decline, Authorities Forbid Private Export</h3>
<p>President Song received the Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, at his private residence the night before last to discuss the recent surge in American dollars and the measures to be taken to suppress it. They deliberated on practical ways to stop it. Yesterday, Bei again firmly stated that the rumors of exchange rate adjustments were absolutely untrue. The Central Bank would supply as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential goods that met the application requirements. It was also learned that the Central Bank had previously strictly stipulated that American dollars could not be used to offset foreign exchange positions. However, there were still many private exports of American dollars, leading to repeated surges in the black market. The authorities have now decided to strictly prohibit the private export of American dollars. Anyone who privately exports more than 200 US dollars without approval will have it confiscated.</p>
<p>The foreign currency, American dollar, has begun to stabilize. General idle funds are abandoning dollars for gold, and there is a lack of momentum for prices to rise. It opened at 4,200 yuan in the morning and was immediately offered for sale. It once fell to 4,030 yuan, then a small number of buyers became active, and the price rose to 4,280 yuan midway. Near noon, it began to plummet again, once falling to 4,000 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 4,100 yuan. In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to sell off goods, and the regulatory authorities announced countermeasures. It once fell to 3,800 yuan and then rebounded, eventually settling around 4,000 yuan. The result was a decrease of about 1,500 yuan compared to the previous day's close. Hong Kong dollars also fell slightly from 830 yuan to around 780 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan. The final selling price for Hong Kong exchange was 800 yuan, Indian exchange was 980 yuan, and British exchange was offered at 12,800 yuan. The official exchange rate for American dollars remained unchanged, and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Rise in American Dollars: Private Absorption to Offset Frozen Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to a manager of a foreign firm, the recent sharp rise in the black market price of American dollars and the strength of the trend were rare in the past. There are various external explanations for the cause, including the continued arrival of foreign ships, with importers massively absorbing American dollars to settle payments, and rumors that the government will raise the exchange rate again. However, the arrival of foreign ships and the settlement of payments is a common situation and does not require a large position in American dollars. At the same time, Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange by the Central Bank stipulates that if there is a balance in each bank's existing foreign exchange account as of September 30 of this year, it should be sold to the Central Bank at the market price on that day. Therefore, the government will not raise the exchange rate at this time and spend a huge amount of legal tender. However, private individuals with frozen foreign exchange are absorbing American dollars to offset their frozen deposits abroad as the time for selling to the Central Bank approaches. These powerful individuals are absorbing large quantities, which is the main reason for the sharp rise in American dollars.</p>
<h3>Bulls Take Profits, Chinese Stocks All Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday was quite volatile. At the opening, following the lingering momentum from the afternoon before, most popular stocks saw lower prices, except for Jingfu, Qin and slight increases. Mixed results were seen in unpopular stocks. After the opening, Zhu Neng rallied. Soon, large investors wanted to take profits, and a sudden surge occurred. Retail investors blindly followed, and an unusual brightness appeared midway. However, many popular stocks took the opportunity to take profits, and as a result, after the buying momentum stabilized slightly, the supply of shares loosened. After rising by half a percent, the stock market finally could not sustain it and declined. However, there were slight twists and turns midway. From 11:30, there was much panic, and buyers disappeared. The situation changed dramatically, and the shares of each stock began to break into the opening price line, which was unfavorable. Even with a small number of shorts covering, it was to no avail. The market became even weaker near the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha and Hui declined, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qin each weakened by a small half percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Tongyi, Datong, underwear, Jinglun, matches, cement, Huafeng, Wuhe, and silk were all flat, with limited declines. Jing slightly rose, while Zhongfang, Xinhe, Rongfeng, and Xinya companies declined by about half a percent. The total trading volume was 14,087,600 shares, of which Yongsha accounted for 6.64 million, Jingfu 2.4 million, Xinguang more than 1.6 million, Xinhe and Quan each 800,000, Meiya 500,000, and the rest were small and scattered. Off-market stocks were also slightly weak, credit was tight, and the outlook was dim.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Regulations: Unit of Stock Price Fluctuation</h3>
<p>The stock exchange yesterday temporarily set the unit of stock price fluctuation as follows. Stock price fluctuation unit</p>
<p>Less than 100 yuan 1 jiao</p>
<p>100 yuan or more but less than 200 yuan 5 jiao</p>
<p>200 yuan or more but less than 1,000 yuan 1 yuan</p>
<p>1,000 yuan or more 5 yuan</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>There was a lack of momentum for government bonds to rise. Two major investors supplied bonds at high prices in the market, and the situation was difficult to change. Trading volume was only 4 million yuan face value. Unified Class C opened at 2,150 yuan in the morning, rose slightly to 1,280 yuan, and was immediately suppressed, falling back to 1,960 yuan. It hovered around 2,000 yuan near the close. The result was a decrease of about 120 yuan compared with the previous close. Classes A and B fell 90 yuan, Class D was flat, and Class E also fell 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightens, Gold Prices Ease</h3>
<p>Arbitrage Active, Once as High as 2.29 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the desire to buy gold suddenly increased. People generally believed that the current ratio of gold to American dollars had fallen to a limit, and arbitrage was very active. The Central Bank was struggling, and the rising trend was still in full swing. However, in the afternoon, the Central Bank supplied gold at reduced prices, and prices plummeted. It opened at 2.23 million and fell to 2.215 million due to control and profit-taking, which was affected by the weakness of the American dollar. It then stabilized. As the American dollar recovered, buyers suddenly poured in, and in an instant, the price rose to around 2.25 million. It lingered at this level for a long time. The Central Bank allocated 120 bars at a price of 2.2425 million. After 10 o'clock, arbitrage activity began from 2.14 million, and the rising trend accelerated, reaching a high of over 2.29 million. After that, it was subjected to considerable pressure, and it fell slightly to 2.265 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank sharply lowered prices and sold off, and speculators were also forced to sell due to tight credit. It plunged to 1.16 million before stabilizing. The result was a decrease of 60,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 30,000 yuan, silver bullion was 2,800, silver dollars were slightly higher, and the unofficial interbank interest rate was tight, with interest rates ranging from 1 jiao 3 to 1 jiao 8.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon continued to rise. The 120 Heavenly Bridge was popular. It opened at 3.54 million yuan in the morning and closed at 800,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the highest bid was over 850,000 yuan. There were transactions at 750,000 yuan in the middle. Later, some people took the opportunity to sell high, and people's hearts gradually became uncertain. Finally, it closed at 600,000 yuan, which was still 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Various other brands of goods were more than 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of factory-spun silk was chaotic, and ordinary goods were raised by more than 100,000 yuan. Because silk merchants considered the price of rayon to be too high and the selling price of finished products could not meet the cost, they all shifted their target and purchased factory-spun silk, causing holders to raise prices. Silk goods followed the raw materials and rose at the same time, increasing by about 10 percent. However, after the factory price increased, it was difficult to make progress in sales.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm, Oil and Grain Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in the north and south registered a total of more than 8,000 shi of goods. Because indica rice was more popular, stores were very willing to buy it. The market once rose in the morning but turned weaker at noon. As a result, the price increased by 1,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of japonica rice were both small, and the price was firm. White yuan was still scarce, and the price of soybeans was high and stagnant. The supply of broad beans from the producing areas was scarce, and the source decreased significantly. Retail sales continued to move, and the price increased by more than 2,000 yuan. The wheat market was stable. Foreign firms inquired about bran, and factories did not ship much. The price rose by 1,000 yuan. There were no transactions in flour. New peanuts were actively traded and continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Old goods were flat. Red sorghum was eagerly bought by distilleries and continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Oil prices were very active in stores, with mutual purchases. Soybean and rapeseed oil both rose by 500 to 600 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was firm and slightly increased by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption of Tax on Edible Oil</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance to request that crude soybean and rapeseed oil be exempted from tax for one year, stating: "The one-year exemption of business tax on food is intended to relieve the people's food supply, and the raw materials of soybean and rapeseed oil are indeed food, and their use for oil production is also for food. They should be included in the scope of food and exempted from business tax. Although cotton oil raw materials are not food, their use for oil production is necessary for the people's food supply. In addition to supplying food to the people, the surplus cotton oil can also be shipped for export and sold to European countries for refining to replace olive oil. And at this time of encouraging exports, tariffs are still exempted. If business tax is exempted to reduce costs, it can be exported in large quantities, recovering the losses and earning foreign markets."</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Transactions Decrease</h3>
<p>Foreign stock transactions decreased. Except for Jardine Matheson and Steel, which were relatively stable, the rest declined slightly under pressure from those who were closing out positions. Jardine Spinning reached a high price of 91,200 yuan, and Union Insurance reached 11,400 yuan, but there was immediate pressure, and no one maintained the price, and the market became small. The results compared to the previous close were that Jardine Matheson slightly rose, Steel was flat, and Jardine Spinning, Union Insurance, Yip, Paper, and Jardine Brewery all declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Registers Foreign Banks, Allows Them to Join Clearing House</h3>
<p>It is learned that most of the foreign banks in this city have been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and have successively joined the Bankers Association of Members. It is now known that all registered foreign banks are allowed to participate in the clearing house as exchange members, just like Chinese banks and firms. The authorities of the clearing house have now separately assigned exchange numbers.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Assessment Meeting Decides Sugar Prices Will Not Change Temporarily; Quota Sugar Distribution to be Finalized Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau's Sugar Price Assessment Committee convened a meeting at 4 pm yesterday.

It is said that the Municipal Assembly will be invited to send representatives to participate in the discussion at that time.</p>
<h3>30,000 Pieces of Cotton Textiles to be Shipped to Nanyang for Trial Sales</h3>

It is reported that there is a great need for cotton and silk textiles in Singapore. Japanese and British goods competed for sales before the war. Now, Japan has not yet resumed production, and Britain is also too busy to do so. Therefore, if factories can improve the quality, the Nanyang market is very promising.</p>
<h3>World Sugar Production Estimated at 30 Million Tons This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The US Department of Agriculture predicts that world sugar production for 1946-47 will be approximately 30 million tons, a decrease of 13 percent compared to the average production of 34,544,000 tons in 1939.</p>

<h3>Suiyuan in the Shadows</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Ru</p>
<p>Our newspaper's Suiyuan dispatch, 9th</p>
<p>Before the war, Suiyuan had 16 counties: Gui Sui, Salachi, Baotou, Wuchuan, Guyang, Tokto, Helingeer, Qingyonghe, Liangcheng, Jining, Taolin, Xinghe, Linhe, Wuyuan, and Dongsheng. Anbei and Woye Special Administrative Bureau, Ulanqab League: Erhan, Sizi Banner, Urat Central, East, and West Three Banners, Maoming'an Banner; Yikezhao League: Junwangsuo, Dalate Expansion, Hangjin, Jungar Banner, Otog Banner, Uxin Banner, Zasak Banner. These are the 13 banners of the U and Y Leagues, the Sui East Zheng Huang, Xiang, Hong, and Zheng Hong four banners. Tumet Special Banner. Statistics show that before the war, the entire Suiyuan Province had jurisdiction over 18 counties and bureaus, and 18 banners.</p>
<p>Provincial Outline: 18 Banners and 24 Counties</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the Woye Special Administrative Bureau had disputes with Ningxia Taole, with two names for one place. Ningxia established Taole, and Woye was virtually canceled. In western Suiyuan, two counties were added: Wuyuan and Linhe: Micang and Yanjiang counties, Shaba City, and Langshan Special Administrative Bureau. In the Yimeng Dalate, a training office was established, and an office was established in Taolimin, at the junction of Otog and Hangjin. These two places were also equivalent to a special administrative bureau. Currently, the entire province has 24 counties, cities, bureaus, and offices, in addition to the 18 banners, which have not been changed.</p>
<p>After the recovery, the five counties in eastern Suiyuan—Feng, Ji, Tao, Liang, and Xing—had four counties occupied by the Communists. Only Taolin County was under the jurisdiction of the Sui Provincial Government, and even the villages in Taolin were not fully investigated. The four banners in eastern Suiyuan were no different from the five counties in eastern Suiyuan, so all four banners also fell into the hands of the Communists. Many villages in Qingshuihe and Helingeer counties in southern Suiyuan were also occupied by the Communists. Currently, the ones that remain intact are the 13 banners of the U and Y Leagues, the Tumet Banner. The seven counties and cities in western Suiyuan—Shaba, Linhe, Zhucang, Langshan, Yanjiang, Wuyuan, and Anbei. The two counties behind Yinshan Mountain—Wuchuan and Guyang. The three counties on the Sui-Bao railway—Gui Sui, Baotou, and Salachi County, Tokto County in southern Suiyuan, Dongsheng County in western He, and Taolimin Office. Dalate Training Office. A total of 16 counties, cities, bureaus, and offices. Although the county seats of Qingshuihe and Helin counties in southern Suiyuan and Taolin County in eastern Suiyuan belong to the Sui Provincial Government, the villages have already been infiltrated and occupied by the Communists.</p>
<p>A Harmonious Atmosphere: Establishing a Democratic Cornerstone</p>
<p>The Suiyuan Provincial Government has had a history of 15 years since General Fu Zuoyi took office as chairman. It has undergone three reorganizations. The personnel for this year's reorganization are as follows: Chairman Fu Zuoyi, Committee Members Wang Zeding (concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department), Pan Xiuren (concurrently Director of the Education Department), Zhang Xiamin (concurrently Director of the Finance Department), Zhang Yiding (concurrently Director of the Construction Department), Chen Bingqian, Li Juyi, Rong Xiang, Zeng Houzai, and Yan Wei. Yu Chunzhai is the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. Among them, Rong Xiang is from the Tumet Banner, and Pan Xiuren, Zhang Xiamin, and Yan Wei are all from Suiyuan. Four well-known local Han Chinese participated in the provincial government, and two of them also served as directors, which is rare since the founding of the Republic.</p>
<p>The councils of all counties and cities in Suiyuan have been formally established. The Provisional Provincial Council was established in Shaba in the winter before last. After the recovery, it moved to Sui and convened the second congress. This spring, the Provincial Council was also formally established. One provincial councilor is elected by the citizens of each county and city. The U and Y Leagues, the Tumet Banner, and the four banners in eastern Suiyuan each have one member. Mongolians and Han Chinese jointly participate, creating a harmonious atmosphere and establishing a democratic cornerstone. The speaker of the Provincial Council is Zhang Qin, and the deputy speaker is Yan Su, both prominent figures in Suiyuan and meritorious in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Pitiful Education: Serious School Building Problems</p>
<p>Before the war, Suiyuan's secondary schools included Gui Sui Provincial Middle School, Baotou Provincial Middle School, Jining Provincial Middle School, Gui Sui Provincial Normal School, Girls' Normal School, Vocational School of Engineering, Vocational School of Agriculture, National Sui Meng Normal School, Tumet Banner Middle School, and Private Zhengfeng Middle School. After the fall of Sui Bao, the schools completely stopped. Later, the following were established in western Suiyuan: National Suiyuan Middle School, Private Fendou Middle School, Suining Normal School (in Huangquqiao, Ningxia), National Yimeng Middle School (in Zasak Banner, Yimeng), Hexi Normal School (in Dongsheng).</p>
<p>One year after the victory, Suiyuan's secondary schools include: the largest in scale and best-equipped Fendou Middle School, founded by Chairman Fu Zuoyi; and the privately run Zhengfeng Middle School, founded by Director Pan, which is smaller in scale. Public schools include National Suiyuan Middle School, which was moved from western Suiyuan to Sui Bao, but has no school site yet. National Yimeng Middle School (still in Yimeng), Hexi Normal School was changed to Baotou Simple Normal School, and the address is still in Dongsheng. The Vocational School of Agriculture has been restored, and Baotou Provincial Middle School has been restored the fastest. The school site of Gui Sui Provincial Normal School was severely damaged, but classes have been resumed. Gui Sui Provincial Middle School has recently enrolled students, but the school site is still occupied by the military.</p>
<p>Originally, Suiyuan's education was very pitiful before the war, but it has become even worse since the victory. Regardless of whether it is provincial or national, they cannot even find a school site. However, private schools such as Fendou Middle School have taken advantage of the takeover to make the school site magnificent and luxurious, ranking first in Sui. The current situation is that private schools are developing well. There are also private middle schools run by Catholics and other charities, which are generally good. Elementary school education is even poorer. Elementary school teachers in various counties have not received salaries for half a year, and gentry in several counties have launched donations to maintain it. Not to mention rural elementary schools, someone inspected a rural elementary school in Wuchuan County, and it was not even as good as a dilapidated private school. Students do not know that this year is the 35th year of the Republic of China, but instead say it is "Chengji ×× year." This is certainly a very small minority, but the enemy's slave education has not yet been completely cleared, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The News Industry is Also Not as Good as Before the War</p>
<p>Suiyuan's news industry is still not as good as before the war. Suiyuan has two daily newspapers: (1) Minguo Daily (Party newspaper), (2) Fendou Daily (government newspaper). One evening newspaper: Suiwen Evening News. Baotou has one daily newspaper: Baotou Daily. During the war, Fendou Daily was published in Shaba, but the Shaba edition has been discontinued.</p>
<p>Suiyuan's news agencies include the New China News Agency, sponsored by the 12th War Zone Headquarters. Because it is government-run, it has more manpower and sufficient funding, and its scale is the largest in the province. The second is the Suiyuan News Agency, which was established before the war. The Sui Meng News Agency was founded in western Suiyuan during the war.</p>
<p>Out-of-town newspapers are more popular than local newspapers in Suiyuan. The Tianjin Dagongbao has the most circulation, followed by the Beiping North China Daily, the Shijie Daily, and the Nanjing Central Daily. The Shanghai newspapers that are sold in Suiyuan include the Shenbao and the Dagongbao, and the photoprint edition of the Shenbao is especially loved by the local people.</p>
<h3>When the Green Screen Rises: The National Army Arrives, the Harvest is Good, Everyone is Full</h3>
<p>— Photo by Northeast Press</p>
<p>On the Northeast Plain, the sorghum stalks are taller than people, enough to cover their heads. It is just the time when the "green screen" that everyone often hears about rises.</p>
<p>The green screen is a great threat to the lives of the people in the Northeast, because the continuous large sorghum fields are where bandits hide and come and go. Today, what is in front of us is the "war disaster" that is even more severe than the banditry of the past. The green screen is the best place for a certain party to carry out sabotage or to serve as a basis for tactics.</p>
<p>Sorghum, the main food of the people of the Northeast, is expected to have a bumper harvest this year due to favorable weather conditions. This place introduces several beautiful pictures. They, no, they are singing the big hot year this year!</p>
<p>Picture description</p>
<p>(1) Miss Kunming is singing "Harvest Song" in the sorghum fields of the Northeast.</p>
<p>(2) Come on! Please have a cigarette we brought from Kunming</p>
<p>(3) Members of the Political Work Team of the 60th Army go to the countryside to ask how much is harvested per mu this year?</p>
<p>(4) The common people said that this year the National Army came, the place is peaceful, the harvest is good, and the eight members of the family are all full.</p>
<p>(5) The 60th Army came to the Northeast from the Southwest to take over the territory. Miss Li Hui from Kunming followed the army to work in the Northeast. Miss Southwest shakes hands with the sorghum for the first time in the sorghum fields of the Northeast</p>

<h3>Unemployed Military Officers Should be Received for Training</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I strongly agree with the point that redundant unemployed military officers should be received for training with preferential treatment. However, some unemployed military officers are rejected because they do not have complete documents. I believe that as long as they can find three active-duty military officers above the rank of colonel to certify them, they should be given preferential treatment and allowed to receive training. According to what I know, there are no fewer than several thousand people in places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi who have not been able to report. They have used up all their travel expenses, are wandering and helpless, and have difficulty getting a full meal every day. The sight of this is truly pitiful. I hope the government authorities will quickly find a way to provide them with preferential treatment and receive them for training! (Ye Jingyi)</p>
<h3>Street Names in Taiwan Urgently Need to be Corrected</h3>
<p>Taiwan has rejoined our country for more than a year now, and the most shocking thing is that the street names remain the same as before and have not been changed to this day! A friend of mine works at the Taiwan Salt Administration, and in a recent letter, the address of the agency on the envelope was: "Taihoku City, Honcho 2-chome, No. 5." A dignified government agency publicly prints the address of an enemy, which is truly shameless! Does it still hope that Taiwan will return to the arms of the Japanese bandits? Or are they fighting for commercial gain and blinded by profit? In this situation, the rest can be imagined. How can this not make the Taiwanese despise it and be laughed at internationally? (Xu Wenyu)</p>
<h3>Postal Substitute</h3>
<p>Reply to Residents Near Ciyou Road Huizhan Street: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, regarding the difficulty of obtaining drinking water at the above two locations, replied to this newspaper stating: "To facilitate universal water supply, this Bureau has established the 'Shanghai Municipal Retail Tap Water Sales Method'. We kindly request you to inform the public and recommend a representative to come to Room 105, No. 50 Jiujiang Road, to discuss the installation methods with the Bureau's Water Supply Station, for the benefit of the citizens."</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Mo Changgen: The letter from the Bureau of Public Utilities roughly stated: "Regarding the installation of faucets in the South Shanghai District, they are exclusively for firefighting purposes by the district's fire brigade and have never been opened to the public. The free opening of some fire hydrants in the city this summer was a temporary emergency measure due to the epidemic. It should not be regarded as a regular means of providing relief for civilian drinking water."</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Huang Zhixin: Regarding your inquiry about the sale of subsidized sugar, we have recently received a reply from the Bureau of Social Affairs stating: "The city's sugar purchase method has already been changed in terms of its detailed procedures, and the organizing agency will announce it. It is expected to be implemented in October. Please inform him accordingly."</p>
<p>A letter from the Municipal Senior Vocational School stated: "After the summer vacation, this school formulated the tuition fees for this semester and submitted them to the Bureau of Education for approval. Subsequently, we received instructions from the Education Bureau: the approved fees for the vocational classes of this school are 30,000 yuan for teacher appreciation, 30,000 yuan for accommodation, 20,000 yuan for equipment, and 8,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, totaling 88,000 yuan per student, not 250,000 yuan. As for meals, they are handled by a student-organized committee. 100,000 yuan is collected in advance at the beginning of the semester and handed over to the meal association upon its establishment. We hope this can be published for the benefit of the students."</p>
<h3>Social Services Reader Replies</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>Redeeming a Pledged House</p>
<p>Yang Songling asks: A friend of mine, Mr. Yu, pledged a house from Mr. Jia in the 32nd year of the Republic of China for a term of three years. All legal procedures were completed at that time. The term has been overdue for many years. According to the law, it should not be possible to redeem the house. Now, Mr. Jia suddenly asks a lawyer to handle the redemption procedures with Mr. Yu. I have several questions and would like you to answer them: (1) The house pledged in the 22nd year of the Republic of China was not redeemed after the deadline. Can Mr. Yu obtain the ownership of the pledged property? (2) Now, the pledger asks a lawyer to send a letter to the pledgee to handle the redemption procedures, but the pledgee goes to negotiate, but the pledger and the lawyer have already left. Can a crime be established legally? (3) It has been more than a month since the pledgee received the letter, but the pledger and the lawyer have not met with the pledgee. The pledgee fears that unscrupulous people will infringe on the property rights. He publishes a statement in the newspaper to legally obtain the ownership of the pledged property. Is the pledgee's statement legally valid?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] (1) According to Article 923, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, if the pledger does not redeem the pledged property at the original price after two years from the expiration of the pledge period, the pledgee obtains the ownership of the pledged property. (2) No crime is established. (3) Publishing a statement in the newspaper has no legal effect.</p>

<h3>On Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>— Lixing</p>
<p>By C. D. Burns</p>
<p>Translated and Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>This book discusses political philosophy, mainly explaining the ideals of democratic politics. According to its ideals: "Democratic politics is a moving emotional concept of a society yet to be created; in this society, all men and women have equal rights to enjoy all the benefits of civilized life—such as protection from violence and tyranny, adequate property and leisure, so that everyone can freely develop their inherent talents; but the most important of these talents is the ability to work with others for a common goal. Therefore, the ideal of democracy includes a society in which all members voluntarily contribute their thoughts and emotions to this common storehouse, and also contribute the usual work for the sake of maintaining civilized life." Although modern democratic systems are still far from this ideal, the right-wing authoritarian Fascists and the left-wing authoritarian Communists who have risen up to attack it are not necessarily reasonable, and may even be worse than what they attack. It repeatedly argues, and there are many very novel and insightful opinions in it, which are worth our reference. This book has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Sun Siming, and now I will introduce a summary of it.</p>
<p>The Origin of Democracy</p>
<p>The book has seven chapters, the first chapter talks about "The Origin of Democratic Politics." One of the paragraphs describes how Britain developed into the motherland of democratic constitutionalism, and the understanding is very thorough. It is said that... "The British were the first to give the monarch a real limit, so that he could not help but be restrained in deciding when and how to get money. It was also the British who, for nearly nine hundred years, were always accustomed to having foreigners as kings, such as the Norman dynasty, the Burton Jena dynasty; the Hutton dynasty, the Stuart dynasty, and the current Hanover dynasty, who could be miraculously or directly controlled by the local landlords and the House of Commons. Now everyone in practice inherits and accepts cabinet politics and cabinet members are responsible to Parliament, which is the result of the English king not being a British custom." This shows that the development of democratic politics is probably a historical development. Our people often forget this lesson when talking about democracy, which should arouse everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "The Evangelical Establishment", mainly talks about the theories and systems that oppose democratic politics, and also has very insightful views on the causes of Fascism and Communism. He said: "Fascist dictatorship can always be traced back to the back of Marx, and can be traced back to Marx's teacher Ritzier. —Its theory can also be attributed to the power politics of the nineteenth century."</p>
<p>Democracy and Merits and Demerits</p>
<p>Chapter Three talks about the merits and demerits of democratic politics, and makes powerful defenses of the freedom of rights, the right to vote, party politics, and the worship of incompetence that are often criticized by opponents of democracy. The author said: The modern ideal of personality does not regard man as an atom, but as a major part of society, so when we mention freedom, we never leave any social relationship. Nor does it only refer to the protection of others, but to the power of everyone to do their best, especially in the cooperation of friendship in common work." This has destroyed and cleared up the atomic individualism of the eighteenth century. He also said, "All intelligence has a strong emotional color. ...Democratic politics does not regard people as calculating machines... In fact, the bad thing about an appeal to emotion lies in the actual use of degraded emotions, not in the emotion itself." This has also greatly revised the old "rationalism". He also said: "Democratic politics does not contain the idea that human wisdom is equal or should be made equal. Human equality is only an assumption." This also clearly explains the misunderstanding of the theory of social equality.</p>
<p>Chapter Four talks about "Democratic Institutions", divided into (1) representative elections, (2) opponents can form political parties to openly discuss public policies, (3) cabinet members are responsible to a popularly elected parliament or a popularly elected president to manage the administration. "Democratic institutions originally wanted to bring together the mountain criticism of human power and the agile decisions and firm actions of those in power in the same political system." He also said: "In all democratic countries, there is now a tendency to centralize power in the executive branch." This view is similar to the "separation of powers" advocated by the founding father. He also said: "Civil rights and the rule of law are maintained by the courts in democratic politics." Nowadays, most gentlemen who discuss democratic constitutionalism in our country pay little attention to this point, which is also worthy of special mention. He also said: "Under a democratic system, the various institutions of the government are all integrated." This is also very consistent with the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution advocated by the founding father.</p>
<p>Two Problems with Democratic Institutions</p>
<p>Chapter Five talks about "Democracy and Peace". He said: "The entire movement of democratic politics includes a rejection of the most outdated traditional political institution—war and the preparation for war. ...The League of Nations system is a natural result of the development of democratic politics in the art of government; but if the main member states are not all democratic countries, the League of Nations system will not be able to function at all."</p>
<p>Chapter Six, "Democracy and Industry," mainly discusses the labor policies that democratic governments should take. It opposes vocational representation, saying: "In this book, we do not recognize that democratic politics is just a balance of competing interests; ...but a tool for expressing the will for the public welfare shared and established by everyone, then a person's neighbors and nearby colleagues are actually the best tools to enable him to learn how to unite for a real common welfare. It also opposes class struggle. It believes that "a war always requires a clear distinction between the two sides; and in the modern state, if we want to start Marx's war, there are too many no-man's lands." It believes that the trade union movement and the consumer cooperative movement that have emerged under the democratic system have enabled tens of thousands of workers to learn about democratic politics, while in the authoritarian governments of Fascists or Communists, all trade unions are not automatically organized groups of workers, but are creations of a ruling minority. This kind of trade union is a reaction that makes the dependent ability of workers that comes from slave civilization tend to democracy. These words are worthy of considerable consideration by the gentlemen who are now drafting the constitution and presiding over the labor movement in our country.</p>
<p>The Superiority of Democratic Institutions</p>
<p>Chapter Seven, "The Spirit of Democracy," specifically discusses the educational system and methods that democratic countries should have. It said: "If we want to make democratic institutions necessarily effective, then a democratic social atmosphere must first be created in schools and other educational institutions." It also said, "Democratized education must import the concept that everyone lives in a common life." It also said: "Schools should contribute to a new patriotism, so that it can not only defend and triumph; but also make closer contacts and mutual services with other countries." We believe that educators in the era of the United Nations should regard these words as the standard.</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Bao is a defender of democratic politics. He believes that democratic institutions still have many shortcomings; but before other better systems have been invented, they should be improved or abolished by democratic methods—that is, open discussion of public policies and free criticism, and then established authority. He hates and ridicules the most those who prohibit open discussion and free criticism, such as Fascists or Communists. One said: "No matter what kind of power system, it only reduces the intelligence and vitality of the people under its rule. Therefore, the dictatorship's raising the status of leaders or a few people in power is actually at the expense of reducing the moral status of the majority of men, women, old and young." The other said: "Their opposition is just like the confrontation between barbarism and civilization, and the confrontation between martial arts and science." These words seem to be a bit too much. From an objective point of view, during the fascist regime in Italy and the national socialist regime in Germany, all aspects of politics, economy and culture were much more advanced than before; since the Bolsheviks came to power in the Soviet Union, they have vigorously implemented the socialist planned economy, and all science and technology have made great strides; to this day, American reporters report that it does not make progress intentionally, nor does it corrupt; these are all undeniable facts. Can we say that intelligence has regressed? Can we say it is barbaric? I believe that things within the scope of social science are always inevitably different in terms of good and evil due to time and place, and cannot be generalized. Mr. Bao's statement may be influenced by traditional social assumptions or cultural standards!</p>
<h3>Recent Children's Publications</h3>
<p>— Dayan</p>
<p>Under various material difficulties, publishing a publication is really not an easy task; children's publications are of course the same.</p>
<p>Another difficult thing is the content of children's publications, in addition to being meaningful, needs to be realistic, and more importantly, interesting; most children are not easy to take care of. And books are originally static things, so they must be in line with the times, the season, and full of activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, a children's publication is very difficult to please, which is why some publishers who are afraid of "losing money" do not dare to try it easily.</p>
<p>On the contrary, another kind of "toxic" comic strips have been developing abnormally, inducing pure children everywhere in the streets and alleys. This is really not the most dangerous phenomenon.</p>
<p>But we have no way to stop them from reading those harmful things, because they all have an unstoppable desire for knowledge, not to mention that comic strips are a very good form, even if there is no content, but the children there know this "toxic"?</p>
<p>If it can be used to instill good children's knowledge, it must be very successful. In the past, the Popular Bookstore published comic books with good stories, such as "Robinson Crusoe", "Tai Lan Joins the Army", etc., which were quite popular among children, but the oppression at that time was too great, so it gradually faded away, which is very regrettable; recently, comic strips in major newspapers such as Sanmao Joins the Army, etc., children readers seem to be more than adults, therefore, I hope comic authors, take this into account, and also write more for children.</p>
<p>We can only try our best to introduce children's publications with good content and full of activity, and publications of this form of "comic strips", to pull children away from those "toxic" "reading materials". Severe prevention is not a good way.</p>
<p>In the recent children's publication industry that seems to be very lively, there is only one that is completely in the form of Daohong; but general publications are very able to pay attention to also using illustrations as much as possible, helping to instill excellent children's knowledge. These publications can generally meet the conditions of children's reading materials, but of course they still need to constantly strive for improvement.</p>
<p>Now we will introduce those very promising children's publications for the reference of parents.</p>
<p>The Children's Bookstore's "Children's Knowledge" has published its second issue, which is the only monthly magazine that is completely in the form of continuous pictures; according to the two issues published, they are indeed working hard to achieve the three points of new, refined, and interesting. The text connected to the books is quite simple, and Gang paintings are sometimes used in colored editions, which is very helpful in arousing children's interest. The content is also quite rich; but for use as a "primer" for children, it sometimes seems a little complicated and overwhelming, and is more suitable for low-grade elementary school students. In today's children's reading materials, it can indeed be said to be a publication with vision and courage.</p>
<p>"Children's World" has been presided over by Mr. He Gongchao since it moved to Shanghai. These issues are all Chongqing editions. According to Mr. He at a reception, after the Chongqing edition is finished, the content will be innovated immediately, and realistic texts will be added as much as possible, so that children will feel intimate when they read it. Introducing various daily knowledge and new science will enable children to understand the times and encourage progress. It is expected that it will be a refreshing experience for me and others.</p>
<p>The one with the most content is the "Primary School Student Semi-Monthly Magazine", which is a middle and high-grade children's publication that contains a wider range and is full of activity. We can often see fairy tales written in lively and interesting writing styles that are suitable for the times and national conditions, scientific knowledge introduced in concise and clear language, and "small crafts" and "primary school student gardens" to encourage children to write and use their hands. Compared to the materials for training them to use their hands, there are fewer. There are also illustrations in the text, which are quite good, but also a little less. The arrangement uses horizontal lines and two sizes of characters, which has advantages and disadvantages. However, the editors and authors, Mr. Han, pay attention to being fully active, which is a feature.</p>
<p>The "Children's Weekly" of the China Pictorial Publishing House has the least content, but it is not easy to publish it every week. The content is mostly fairy tales and stories, with less science; the text can be concise and maintain the past relaxed style.</p>
<p>There is also a monthly magazine "Era Children", which is rich in content and full, concise and specific; it is suitable for senior elementary school children to read. However, it was not published during the summer vacation, so there is one less good children's reading material.</p>
<p>In the past, major newspapers such as Shen Bao all had children's periodicals. Now only Da Wan Bao still has "Children's Paradise" edited by Mr. Shen Baiying, which is published every Monday. It is a pity that the most common newspapers lack food for children.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the content, text, and printing of these publications are quite advanced, and it can also be seen that some educators and authors who care about children are doing their best, never being shoddy, and striving for progress, which can be congratulated for children and for the country.</p>
<p>Wise parents! Introduce them to your children more, that will be a valuable thing, and it is also some of the responsibilities that parents should have.</p>
<h3>Reading Quotations</h3>
<p>— Li Shugu</p>
<p>"Guan Tingyao asked about learning, and I said, painters say that it is easy to paint ghosts, but difficult to paint horses, because ghosts have no quality, while horses have evidence. Now those who talk about the Book of Changes and the Supreme Ultimate Diagram each come up with their own mental and manual images, which are chaotic and lead to good knowledge. Those who are rampant and self-satisfied, silently have things, are all painting ghosts. You are determined to learn to be a son, a subject, a brother, a friend, rites, music, soldiers, and farmers, and you are only painting horses." (Li's legacy on learning)</p>
<h3>New Theory of Construction Geography</h3>
<p>— Naya</p>
<p>By Ren Meiao Published by The Commercial Press Publication Date: June of the 35th Year 135 Pages</p>
<p>At present, our young people do not pay attention to geography books, especially extracurricular ones; this is of course because these books are too "bitter medicine". This attitude is absolutely wrong in our China, which is waiting for revival and construction.</p>
<p>May I ask: What is the post-war reconstruction work? To answer in one sentence: It depends on economic construction; from this, we understand the importance of paying attention to geography books. The chaotic construction of post-war China depends on the efforts of every young person. First, we must "know", and then "act"; from this, we understand the importance of reading even more.</p>
<p>Mr. Ren Meiao has lectured on economic geography and construction geography at Central, Zhejiang, Fudan and other universities; Here, Mr. Ren has integrated eleven papers published in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao over the past six years, and one recent work, into a book, and named it: "New Theory of Construction Geography".</p>
<p>The content of this book includes three articles on principles, five on industrial areas, three on land use, and one on transportation geography; among these, the eleven published articles have been revised according to the latest materials, and repeated and unsuitable places have been deleted.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Wenhao also said in the preface to this book: "...Looking forward, how to consolidate the national foundation, establish national defense, and strive to achieve a prosperous and strong state, and maintain permanent peace with all countries in the world, the work in the future will be very difficult... Regarding the way of effort, we should first promote economic construction, and the implementation of construction must clearly understand the way of adapting to local conditions, the method of balanced development, the division of economic zones, and the distribution of resource reserves, so the knowledge of geography is still important... Mr. Ren Meiao has selected the results of his research over the years, and published them in articles, advocating the connection between construction and the environment, which is highly valued by the general public... The dissemination of geographical knowledge will be wider from this, and the geographical research of economic construction will gradually rise..."</p>
<p>Indeed, this book has a very wide content. The three articles on principles: Geographical Research and Economic Construction; The Theoretical System of Economic Geography. These three chapters of articles tell us about the geographical research of the National Industrial Plan, discussing the tasks and training of geographical engineers; the nature and scope of economic geography, the central idea, and dynamic economic geography.</p>
<p>From this, we know that economic geography is a systematic and living science. The theoretical system about it has been roughly established. In terms of transportation and commercial geography, we do not yet have a clear regional status theory, which is waiting for our continued research to elaborate and develop.</p>
<p>The five articles on industrial areas: Research on the Theory of Industrial Areas, The Idea of Industrial Location in Industrial Planning, China's Industrial Center after the War, and the Outline of China's Southwest National Defense Industrial Area.</p>
<p>Here, the micro-research on industrial areas, the dynamic industrial location, the political factors and industrial machinery are described; the location of various industries and its principles; each topic has been fully elaborated and explained.</p>
<p>The three articles on land use: Geographical Research on the Location of the Iron and Steel Industry Area, A Preliminary Proposal for Conducting a National Land Use Survey, and Land Use near Zunyi, Guizhou; it describes the relationship between raw materials and factory location of the iron and steel industry, the geographical distribution of the iron and steel industry, and the review of the location of China's iron and steel industry, etc., and introduces it clearly with clear tables.</p>
<p>The one article on transportation geography, the new situation of world geography in the air age, is just as Bacon said! "Don't be superstitious anymore, we have to open our eyes and look at the reality of the world." In the air age, world geography (including China) has undergone tremendous changes, and the process of this change has been briefly described in the book.</p>
<p>The book contains a book review, which is Soils and Man published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1938. This was co-authored by more than 100 experts from the Department of Agriculture and is indeed one of the main issues in the modern world. A brief introduction was made.</p>
<p>In short, this book can be read in a very short time and can gain a lot of knowledge, which is a must-read for our young people.</p>

<h3>Random Jottings from a Mountain Abode</h3>
<p>— Dai Wangshu</p>
<p>Mountain Wind</p>
<p>Outside the window, through the veil of night, the misty mountain air probably enshrouds the entire peak. The cool wind plunges straight down from the mountain summit, bringing dampness, bringing the scent of the sun, or bringing a few drops of water splashed from the mountain stream, knocking on our glass window.</p>
<p>Greetings, mountain wind! I open the window to welcome you, I open my coat to welcome you.</p>
<p>Having caressed the edge of the clouds, caressed the small flowers by the cliff, caressed the rocks where wild beasts have lain, caressed the silent earth, the singing stream, you now come to gently caress me. Tell me, mountain wind, do you sense from my chest the fleeting nature of clouds, the loneliness of flowers, the solidity of rocks, the somberness of earth, the liveliness of streams? Will you say: This is a strange creature!</p>
<p>Trees</p>
<p>The roadside trees have been completely felled, leaving only sparse and pitiful roots. The road seems a bit wider, a bit shorter, and the distance to the sky seems closer. The sun shines directly on my head, and pours directly onto my body… Yes, we need sunshine, but we also need shade! The chirping of birds in the morning is gone, the leisurely stroll in the evening is gone. Empty road, lonely road!</p>
<p>Not far from the front of the door, there used to be a mimosa tree. Last autumn, I even picked the long pods for my daughter to play with. It once stood gracefully there, its verdant canopy spread high, entrusting our dreams and giving us cool shade. But now, we can only futilely depict its verdant form in the void, against the backdrop of a blue sky dotted with wing fragments. On a summer morning like this, what a refreshing feeling its bright green leaves and fiery red, eye-catching flowers would give us! What joy the small cries of fledgling birds hidden in its dense shade would give us! Think about it, how sad is its disappearance to me!</p>
<p>Holding my young child, I walked again to the roots of that mimosa tree. The saw marks have turned from pale yellow to dark black, but the annual rings are still clear, not eroded by moss or fungus. I idly counted the rings: forty-two rings! Exactly my age. It and I spent the same years, this poor mimosa tree!</p>
<p>Tree, who is more unfortunate, you or I?</p>
<p>Lost Garden</p>
<p>Toiling anxieties have deprived me of the breadth of vision and the leisure to which I could entrust myself. What I mean is, since I moved to the highest street in this central district, fearing the long journey, I can no longer see the sea every day, nor own a small garden. Behind the house are tall buildings, in front are even higher mountains; the door faces the street, without a single patch of open space. From then on, I have lived facing a wall of mountains, and what makes me most melancholy is especially that small garden in the old residence, that piece of barren land that I personally reclaimed, cultivated, fertilized, sowed, watered, and harvested. That garden faced the sea, surrounded by verdant pine trees. Whenever I was tired of plowing, I would drop my hoe, sit under the pine trees, facing the wind blowing from the distant sails, looking at the vast sea, and it would already make my heart feel refreshed. Moreover, it gave us unexpectedly abundant harvests according to the seasons.</p>
<p>Since moving here, everything has changed. The farm tools, hoes, rakes, spades, pointed hoes, weeding rakes, transplanting bells, watering cans, etc., that were carried on a large cart along with the books, have been coldly abandoned on the rooftop terrace, and have become rusty. These poor things, they should be as lonely as I am.</p>
<p>As if instinctively, I often think: "Now is the time to plant tomatoes," or "Now the corn can be harvested," or "If only I could get some broad bean seeds from my hometown!" I voiced this thought to my wife, so she suggested: "Should we, like the neighbors, have someone carry mud to the rooftop terrace to create a garden there?" But I immediately objected, because the terrace on the roof is so small, and there is so little sunlight, completely blocked by the surrounding tall buildings.</p>
<p>So this plan was abandoned, but the dream of the old garden continued.</p>
<p>Probably seeing that I was often troubled by this thought, my wife was secretly working on something. Suddenly one day, she came to me happily and said: "We can have a real garden. Don't you see there is a vacant lot across from our neighbor? They have few people and can't plant much land. I have already discussed it with them. They will allocate a portion of the land for us to plant. Water is also convenient; we don't have to carry it. Now, tell me when to start."</p>
<p>She must have thought this would give me an unexpected joy, but I answered vaguely, thinking in my heart: "That is not my garden. I want my own garden." But, in order not to embarrass my wife too much, I hesitated and replied to her: "Didn't you advise me not to be too tired? You are right. I need rest. Let's abandon this plan of planting land."</p>
<p>But the dream of the old garden continued, secretly.</p>
<p>The car arrived at the station. The hawkers' cries floated in through the window. Countless strange, curious, foolish faces, as if engraved with the words "struggle for survival," crowded under the car window.</p>
<p>Passengers getting off the car, some taking rickshaws, some walking, went on the ancient road perpendicular to the highway on the right. On the distant ancient road were planted green weeping willows. It was also shrouded in smoke. Very Chinese. At the end of the road was a secluded ancient city. This ancient city was originally unfamiliar to me. But for me, who am good at yearning, it has become a</p>
<h3>Station Head</h3>
<p>— Lan Ben</p>
<p>Mysterious puzzle. I felt as if I was in a dream. I mused that there must be infinite happiness hidden in Zhan City? There must also be fiery passion like fire-red pomegranates? There must also be a first love as sweet as my hometown? But the travelers, harboring different dreams, filed in a row, treading the willow-lined road to the heavenly kingdom of dreams, walking farther and farther... finally disappearing into the gray city of dusk.</p>
<p>"Why does the horizon always seem to be walked in a dream?..." Murmuring the line of poetry, I realized that I was a wandering traveler. Unconsciously, the wheels under my feet were rolling again.</p>
<h3>The Hungarian Playwright Molnár</h3>
<p>— Xu Tonghua</p>
<p>If you happened to be sightseeing in New York in the winter of 1908, you couldn't help but go see "The Devil," a famous play written by Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnár. This was perhaps an unprecedented initiative in the New York theater world, with four theater companies performing it simultaneously, two using English dialogue, one in German, and one in Yiddish.</p>
<p>The play "The Devil" not only caused a sensation in New York but also swept across the United States. Theater managers couldn't find suitable stars for a while because they were all playing the character of Dr. Miller in the play, and even the elaborate costumes worn by Dr. Miller caused panic.</p>
<p>For more than thirty years, Molnár's masterpieces have been staged seventeen times in New York, and only a few American playwrights can maintain this record of honor. His important works include "Carousel," "The Guardsman," "The Good Fairy," and "Liliom." It is said that among contemporary writers, only George Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, and Eugene O'Neill can compare with him.</p>
<p>Molnár went to the United States in January 1940. He was born in Budapest on January 12, 1878. His original surname was Neumann, which he later changed to Molnár because he did not want to use any surname with a German odor, driven by patriotism, with the aim of promoting local Hungarian literature.</p>
<p>In the preface to a collection of plays, he gave a summary of his past life, up to 1925:</p>
<p>"In 1878, I was born in Budapest. In 1896, I was a student studying law in Geneva. In 1896, I was a journalist in Budapest. In 1897, I wrote a short story. In 1900, I wrote a novel. In 1902, I became a playwright in the country. In 1908, I was a playwright known abroad. In 1914, I was a war correspondent. In 1916, I was a playwright again. In 1918, my hair was snow-white. In 1925, I wanted to become a student studying law in Geneva again."</p>
<p>Molnár's father was a very busy doctor. He himself recalled that there were many patients sitting in a dark waiting room, with a melancholic and depressing characteristic. Molnár loved to joke with patients since childhood. Once, it was so bad that he almost scared his own grandmother to death, but according to Molnár himself, this did not happen. His grandmother only broke a leg.</p>
<p>He attended many schools during his school days. In his spare time, he liked to sit in cafes, take out paper and pens, and sketch. His play "Liliom" was written on a marble-topped table in one of the busiest restaurants in Budapest.</p>
<p>Molnár spoke French, German, and Italian fluently. But when he went to the United States in 1940, he only knew a little English. One night, he attended a banquet. All the guests spoke English, which made him feel very painful. After the banquet, he said to a compatriot: "I can't speak English, it's terrible. I can only say, 'Where is my hat?' But this sentence doesn't seem to attract people's attention." Now he is proficient in English. In his residence, there are many English dictionaries, and he is trying to write a new script in English.</p>
<p>In addition, Molnár is not only a playwright but also a novelist. The book "The Hungry City," published in 1901, satirized the corruption of Budapest, very powerfully. His recent work, "Farewell, My Heart," was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1945. His own favorite work is a long novel on the theme of a dancer's tragic love affair.</p>

<p>American English professor C. Twinchster once said: "Although the scholarship of Homer's time has been abandoned, Homer still exists in the present, and he has not aged. Why can't Homer be abandoned? This is because he appeals to the unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times. That is, although individual emotions are born and die in an instant, the ocean of emotions exists in all ages and remains unchanged."</p>
<p>From this statement, he put forward the permanence of art. He believed that the "permanence" of art is built on the "unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times." The "unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times" here is not the "pure artistic quality" proposed by the aesthetic school, but the "combativeness" and "universality" of art. From the combativeness and universality of art, one can write out the immortal truth. This immortal truth constitutes the "permanence" of art.</p>
<p>If we do not deny that "to live is to fight," then art is born from this fight of life. On the road of life, humanity encounters many tragic battles. In these tragic battles, people sometimes groan and shout, sometimes sigh and weep, and sometimes sing the glory of victory and indulge in joy and praise. At this time, the outburst of voice is art. Therefore, art is the crystallization of humanity's struggle with reality, like the sparks that fly out when iron and stone collide, endowed with infinite light and heat.</p>
<p>Cai Leiteli believed that art is a weapon of human struggle. This further expands the scope of life, from the struggle between man and nature to the struggle between man and man. He believed that art is not only a product of struggle but also a tool in the struggle. Nietzsche also said: "Of all writing, I love that written in blood the most." This more emphatically pointed out the "combativeness" of art.</p>
<p>In Ibsen's works, "A Doll's House" and "An Enemy of the People" fully demonstrate the characteristics of combat. He mercilessly aimed his pen at the dark family system and social system of the feudal era, attacking them with a combative posture, prompting them to collapse and accelerating their demise.</p>
<p>While the combative arts can form the permanence of art, the permanent arts, in addition to containing combativeness, also have a universal nature.</p>
<p>The creation of art has undoubtedly broken free from the shackles of idealism, walked out of the narrow and fictional cage, and is stepping on the road of reality. Writers are not only writing about the joys and sorrows of individuals but also writing about the joys and sorrows of the vast masses. The creation of art is not only for the entertainment of the aristocratic class but also to serve as the spiritual food of the masses, making art a popular thing.</p>
<p>Homer is almost three thousand years away from us now, but Homer still lives vividly in our minds. Homer's existence is not his own immortality, but that his works have permanent value.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece, he drifted from city to city, singing to the vast masses, singing the stories in his works. As a result, his epic poems "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" were deeply engraved in the hearts of the masses, and the characters in the story lived forever with Homer. These two popular poems were constantly recited and sung in people's mouths, passed down from generation to generation, and have not disappeared to this day. I can say that Homer's ability to exist permanently is because his works have a universal nature, so they can be passed down forever in everyone's mouth without being erased.</p>
<p>From the combativeness of art, writers point out the mistakes of the times and expose the darkness of society. They use a combative pen to destroy the decadent and dark social system, giving the future era a correct path.</p>
<p>From the universality of art, writers not only write about the joys and sorrows of individuals but also write about the joys and sorrows of everyone, making art the spiritual food of everyone, and no longer offering it in the aristocratic vases, as entertainment for their boredom.</p>
<p>Great artistic creations have "combativeness" and "universality." From the "combativeness" and "universality" of art, one can write out that painful truth. This painful truth constitutes the "permanence" of art.</p>
<p>Finally, let me write down a poem by Dobrolyubov:</p>
<p>No need for flattering ballads,</p>
<p>No need for lyrical poems to recite,</p>
<p>No need for bards' odes,</p>
<p>But rather an inspired old man,</p>
<p>To reveal that painful truth.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 44</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock that evening, the Japanese artillery fire became more and more intense, with shells flying into the north, northeast, and east of Changxindian. I thought that the Chinese garrison in Changxindian was all around the Yongding River west of the town. The town and the four villages were all factory areas and rural farmers' residences. Why were the Japanese shells being fired here? Suddenly, I remembered the scene from that morning when I visited Dingyuan. That kind of sad atmosphere reappeared; the head of the family, thin and emaciated, lying in bed, his wife's face full of sorrow, forcing a smile, talking to me; Meijun quietly running back and forth, taking care of the patient's needs, solving the temporary problems of her younger siblings, and occasionally, on the side, correcting her mother's forgotten words, while seizing the most appropriate opportunity to smile quietly at her father sleeping on the sickbed, as if to use this smile to maintain her father's spirit.</p>
<p>At this time, I really wanted to go see Dingyuan again and try to tell him to move out of the factory as soon as possible; because the target of the shells on the edge of Changxindian might be this factory. But where could they move to in a hurry? While I was considering, a telegram came, and it was an urgent secret telegram. After receiving it, I translated it. It was sent by Tsurumi just before leaving for Japan. He said that the power station in Changxindian might have to be moved to the northwest or southeast; because Tsurumi, taking advantage of the failure of this "three-part" plan, gave a lot of bad medicine to Matsui in the headquarters, asking the headquarters to transfer them back, and strongly recommending Yamamoto Eiji, and others to take over. I understood this very well, because Doihara was the head of the Lan group's special agents, and Matsui and others were subordinates of the Lan group's special agents. Transferring them to the headquarters meant not letting them operate. At the same time, they could take the opportunity to send the weaker Mei group, such as Kita, to North China, which could also reduce some trouble. At the same time, they could also suppress Doihara's power a little.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tsurumi predicted that Doihara, the head of the Lan group, would definitely not be willing, and might transfer Matsui and others to the northwest or southeast to start a new business. When Matsui was transferred, we would follow them. Because our purpose was to slightly support the Mei group and the Matsu group, and to attack the Lan group, implementing a split between these three spy organizations. Tsurumi also mentioned the Tongzhou incident, asking me to take the time to go see it.</p>
<p>This telegram delayed me another half an hour, and it was getting later. "When exactly should I go see Dingyuan; now? Or tomorrow morning?" I thought to myself. There was originally such a superstition in the north that one should not visit the sick at night, because night belongs to yin, and patients are most afraid of yin; and even visiting the sick at night means that the illness is dangerous.</p>
<p>Thinking to myself, I went out the door, preparing to go to the top of the earthen hill to see the artillery fire. Just as I stepped out the door, I caught sight of a long line of people moving on the road going to the Railway Bureau's power plant in the dim moonlight.</p>
<p>"Sneak attack!" I was shocked, and immediately called someone to bring binoculars.</p>
<p>"Kimura's men, carrying parcels and boxes." No. 4 took a quick look and immediately told me, "It seems they are going to the Bureau's factory."</p>

<h3>Canned Stones</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Among the items distributed to public school personnel, mold and rot are often found, and many people express dissatisfaction, believing that it is a waste to spend money to buy these inedible things. However, the people at the distribution office say that this is a very rare phenomenon, and if moldy or rotten items are found, they can be exchanged with the original item.</p>
<p>This is not only the case with the items distributed to public school personnel, but also with ordinary relief supplies, which inevitably suffer from mold and rot. However, like the report from Nanchang in yesterday's newspaper: "When the Jiangxi Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan distributed canned milk, beef, and other relief supplies, the agencies receiving these items found that the wooden boxes containing the cans had cans on top and stones on the bottom..." This situation is not a natural loss but a man-made act of fraud.</p>
<p>Whether the surplus materials from the United States are allocated to us or transferred to us, in whatever form, I wonder if there was a clause for "return for mold and damage" when the agreement was first signed. If not, according to commercial customs, the price must be low, and we have no complaints against our American friends. If the quantity of materials is so large, the transportation is so difficult, and the time delayed is certainly long, even good things can become moldy and rotten.</p>
<p>The person in charge should handle this situation quickly, otherwise, they will be responsible for the delay. However, canned goods turning into stones is a serious matter. It is a kind of fraud of swapping and stealing, which is unforgivable.</p>
<p>A popular saying, used to describe people who use any means to get money, says: "Strip the clothes off a dead man!" Swapping relief cans with stones, its viciousness and ruthlessness are no different from stripping the clothes off a dead man.</p>
<h3>Where Has the Kwantung Army Gone? Who is Performing Magic?</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>On the 21st of this month, Representatives Hillendon and Sikes, members of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, proposed that the U.S. government compel the Soviet Union to explain the mysterious disappearance of one million Japanese soldiers in Northeast China.</p>
<p>This news item will probably remain unanswered for the time being. Let us briefly recall the situation of the Japanese troops stationed in Northeast China in the past: 29,000 people, of which Japanese (including military and civilians) accounted for 566,000. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese government prepared 1.3 million "comfort bags" in 1940 to distribute to Japanese soldiers stationed in China, of which 800,000 were planned to be distributed to the Japanese army in North China, Central China, and South China, and the rest were given to the Northeast garrison, indicating that the total number of the Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China at that time was at least 500,000.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Kyodo News Agency on August 5th of this year: "According to Mr. Toyama Jiro, a Japanese who returned to Fukuoka from a certain country on the 3rd of this month, he stated: Originally belonging to the Gando Garrison Motor Transport Unit, he was sent to Posiet, a certain country, in early October last year, and then sent to Komsomolsk, a northern city in Siberia, to perform labor. His unit consisted of 10,000 people, and the other ten receiving camps held between 80,000 and 100,000 soldiers from the Kwantung Army. The 'certain country' is quite generous, with Japanese prisoners receiving special food three to five times a day and being allowed to bathe daily. If their work efficiency exceeds 50%, their dinner ration is also increased. Komsomolsk is a barren land, and the local farmers receive food that is even worse than that of the Japanese prisoners, so it is unexpected that the Japanese prisoners can receive such preferential treatment. The main work is digging holes and laying water pipes, working eight hours a day."</p>
<p>Let's Look Back at Old Accounts</p>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan, according to the peace treaty of September 1905 and the Sino-Japanese Supplementary Treaty of December of the same year, was allowed to station troops along the South Manchurian Railway, with no more than 15 soldiers per kilometer. This Japanese army stationed in Northeast China was called the "Manchurian Garrison Army," and it had the strength of one division, which was the predecessor of the "Kwantung Army." In 1906, the army further expanded with the "Railway Guard Unit" and the "Ryojun Fortress Command," "Heavy Artillery Battalion," totaling about 20,000 people, all under the command of the "Kwantung Army Headquarters." Later, it continued to increase its troop strength, stationed in Changchun, Fushun, Ryojun, Gongzhuling, Sinuiju, Dashiqiao, and other places, engaging in the deployment of bases for military aggression. The "September 18th Incident" was launched under the leadership of General Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Kwantung Army. After the Japanese army occupied the entire Northeast, it greatly increased its troops and actively implemented immigration. According to the statistics bureau of the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry in 1933, "Manchuria" had a total of 3,090,000 residents.</p>
<p>Shadows Disappear</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, the whereabouts of these more than 500,000 Kwantung Army soldiers became a mystery. Before the surrender, the main locations of the Kwantung Army were Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Tieling, Liaoyang, Andong, and Lianshanguan. When our army went to take over the above-mentioned locations, not even a trace of a Japanese soldier could be seen.</p>
<p>Could these invasive wolves and tigers, the Kwantung Army whose crimes are unforgivable, have been taken away like those industrial equipment in Northeast China?</p>
<p>Japanese Women Seeking Husbands</p>
<p>Our neighboring country's "Imperial Army" has finally been located, and it is said that they are "receiving preferential treatment." As "defeated generals," they are naturally a little "flattered"; it is a pity that they cannot hear the voices of their parents, wives, and daughters in their homeland organizing "husband-seeking groups" and "father-seeking groups," kneeling and crying. Even the "heroes" who were once habitually murderous, would probably shed a few heroic tears if they heard these cries now.</p>
<p>However, we want to ask: "Politicians" who are full of anti-fascist rhetoric, you took away the machines and also took away the Japanese prisoners, what kind of magic are you playing?</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Japanese Prisoners</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Last year, after all the Japanese troops in the country were disarmed, the comrades in Yan'an broadcast that there were still armed Japanese soldiers in Nanjing. At that time, a Nanjing newspaper ran a headline saying: "Yan'an Says There Are Armed Japanese Soldiers in Nanjing, Do Nanjing People Believe It?" Readers all laughed at the Communists' clumsy fabrication of rumors.</p>
<p>At that time, no one paid attention to this rumor offensive; unexpectedly, now there is another bloody fact to answer right and wrong: Who is unscrupulously using Japanese prisoners and giving them preferential treatment? Who are the husband-seeking groups in Tokyo crying out to?</p>
<p>The effect of these facts is nothing more than that many people already feel that they dare not listen to the broadcasts and pamphlets of Yan'an as human speech!</p>
<p>The most terrible thing in the world is flowery pamphlets!</p>
<h3>New Aerial Dropping Device</h3>
<p>U.S. Air Force Sergeant Lawrence was the first to test the new "flying ejection device," jumping from a high-altitude aircraft with its help. Its effect is the same as a parachute. Lawrence is the first person to perform this test.</p>
<h3>Tears of Youth</h3>
<p>— Rui Yun</p>
<p>I want to cry out loud and happily, although others may think that I should be celebrating greatly.</p>
<p>My name is on the list, I'm not seeing things, I've been admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of a certain National University.</p>
<p>Two years of longing, two years of imagining, today it has finally come true, and my heart is filled with uncontrollable joy. Friends come to congratulate me, colleagues come to admire me, they all know that I have been working in the industry for two years after dropping out of school, and they deeply understand my pain of being out of school from my words and deeds in the past. They say that I can finally satisfy my desire for knowledge and solve the pain of being out of school from now on.</p>
<p>I hurried home and told my parents the news very excitedly. As usual, they should share my joy.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, my mother quickly turned her face away, took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped her tears on her face, and my father lowered his head and remained silent for a long time. The air in the room was a little suffocating.</p>
<p>"Originally, a father should feel so happy and honored to hear that his son has been admitted to a national university! But your parents are old, and your only brother has left us to pursue his own personal enjoyment... Alas!" My father's voice trembled a little. "You should still go to study! Don't let us hinder your future, but after the public funding is canceled, who will bear your living expenses when you study?" My father's withered hands rested on my shoulders, and I accidentally looked up and saw that his eyes were wet.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about us, go ahead and work hard! We will always find a way," my father was silent, and I saw his gray and thin back slowly moving closer to the window.</p>
<p>What should I answer?</p>
<p>I want to cry out loud and happily!</p>
<h3>An Eight-Year-Old Becomes a Father—Not a Monster</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Bao report on the 23rd of this month, an eight-year-old child and a nine-year-old child bride in a farmer's family in Jianjian Village, Qixian County, Hebei Province, gave birth to a boy. In the countryside, isn't this a strange thing! Some places may even chop this child to death, saying that he is a monster. In fact, both of these children are precocious and have nothing to do with gods and monsters.</p>
<p>In general, people who are extremely precocious have a particularly strong sexual desire and have a large amount of gonadal endocrine secretions. Ordinary people's testicles or ovaries are a pair, but there are also humans with three gonads. This pair of men and women probably belong to this category.</p>
<p>This strange sexual phenomenon can be attributed to the excessive development of the testicles or ovaries, because the secretion of sex hormones is exuberant, which promotes the precociousness of all sexual behaviors. If surgery is performed to remove part of the particularly large testicles or ovaries, they may be able to develop normally.</p>
<p>However, this kind of castration is not possible in ordinary people. It is impossible to slow down development, increase lifespan, and castrate.</p>
<p>However, sexual transplantation is possible. Originally, the distinction between sexes is common but not absolute. Men and women are not absolutely different individuals. For example, "hermaphrodites" have testicles and ovaries and are neutral individuals. If they are absolute hermaphrodites, surgery can be performed to remove their testicles or ovaries to make them a woman or a man.</p>
<p>In human blood, due to the regulation of the pituitary gland, two kinds of sex hormones are flowing; for example, male urine can sometimes find female sex hormones. Conversely, female urine also contains male sex hormones.</p>
<p>If the ovaries of apes are transplanted into castrated women, their effectiveness can only be maintained for about a year; if female characteristics are incomplete, female hormones can be injected to cure them. Like the pair of children in Qixian County, their gonads not only do not need to inject any hormones, but on the contrary, they secrete too much, which promotes the abnormal development of sexual function and early childbirth.</p>
<p>There is really no need to be alarmed by these things!</p>
<h3>The Emperor Wenchang Changes Position</h3>
<p>— Bang</p>
<p>Applying to schools is difficult because there are many people and few schools. The first hurdle is the difficulty of registration, and the second hurdle is the difficulty of the exam; but it was never expected that the third hurdle would be the difficulty of announcing the results. After taking the school exam, the results are not announced for a long time, and a worry is always lingering. Although taking the exam does not necessarily mean being accepted, there should always be an outcome whether you are accepted or not! Some people say that the reason for not announcing the results after the papers have been graded is to give an opportunity to "seek connections." Therefore, those who are able (and can seek connections) are shrinking their bodies and sneaking in one by one; what about those who have no connections to seek? They are stretching their necks and looking at the list without seeing it!</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, one had to pay to "buy" the title of Xiu Cai. Someone asked Jin Shengtan: "If you have to pay to take the exam, what should you do?" Jin Shengtan replied: "Replace the statue of Emperor Wenchang in the Confucius Temple with the God of Wealth!" But I don't know what the statue of Emperor Wenchang should be replaced with in the current examination situation?</p>
<p>Of course, the "God of Wealth" is not useless, like the example of 300,000 for a piece of exam paper. However, this matter does not seem to be very "fragrant." The best thing is to engage in commerce, which is "substantial" and "upright."</p>
<h3>Random Notes After Teaching</h3>
<p>— w·w</p>
<p>Public school teachers live a hard life. I am careful and take out a banknote, and I have to do some quick mental arithmetic. I won't even let the tram conductor pass if he gives me ten cents less in change. The reason for this is that the income is too low and the expenses are never enough; small debts are still manageable, but what if they pile up! However, let's open our eyes and take a look, and open our ears and listen: "Old Liu failed..." "Three missing one, hurting Yin Zhi." "Come on, let's play a game, set up a fortune-telling stall, doing it occasionally is harmless..." "Mr. ×, advance me ten dollars, I'll win it back today and pay it back tomorrow." But it is difficult to be confused, and we can't always procrastinate. We play today, we play tomorrow. In addition to the "day session" and "night session" on Sundays, there is also a so-called "early session." Bamboo gentlemen often have "fellow travelers," which is really unfortunate! Two years ago, I was also a person who worked hard day and night, I accepted every invitation and went to every game, which made me feel tired and left me penniless. Thinking about it, it really shouldn't have been like that! After thinking carefully, I work as a teacher and teach every day, and I have to take care of the test papers. How much time is left? We often need activities during our leisure time, but we need reasonable activities that are beneficial to our body and mind. There are many so-called recreational activities besides browsing the garden, people research meetings, and discussions. Playing golf, fishing by the sea... these are of course not allowed by the environment; however, taking a short break in the park, enjoying valuable films and dramas, watching exhibitions, listening to music... are all fun. Although it is said that money is vulgar, it is worth spending it if there is a harvest. If you say that the purpose of visiting the bamboo forest is to vainly hope to increase income, then that is absolutely unacceptable. What do you think, fellow teachers?</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Silhouette of General Fu Zuoyi</h3>
<p>— Chong Zhen</p>
<p>A General Who Always Sits in the Town of Suiyuan</p>
<p>Reading the poignant telegram that Fu Zuoyi sent to Mao Zedong on the 22nd reminded me of this old general who is over fifty years old.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has been fighting in the wind and sand. He has always been diligent and conscientious in sitting in the town of Suiyuan, where he has spent more than a dozen years. Therefore, the people of Suiyuan have an indelible good impression of him.</p>
<p>By observing his behavior from childhood, one can determine what kind of person he is. During the Xinhai Revolution, he was only a middle school student who had not completed his education. Dissatisfied with reality and in pursuit of new ideals, he resolutely joined the ranks of the Xinhai Revolution. Although he had never received military training, he participated in the Battle of Niangziguan. This kind of courage is rare for any young person. Later, the success of the Xinhai Revolution gave him infinite comfort and encouragement. In 1917, he entered the 5th term of the Baoding Military Academy and graduated the following year. From then on, he officially put on his military uniform and took on tasks in the military.</p>
<p>In the ten years after leaving Baoding, the achievements of successive battles led to his rapid promotion from a platoon leader to a lieutenant general commander of the Tianjin Garrison Command and commander of the 43rd Division. Among the many generals who came from Baoding, he can be considered one of the most successful.</p>
<p>In 1931, Yan Xishan, chairman of Shanxi Province, believed that Suiyuan was a barrier to the Northwest and that foreign troubles and bandits might invade from time to time. Therefore, he had to select the best talent to take on the important task of guarding Suiyuan. After thinking about it, he recommended Fu Zuoyi to take charge of Suiyuan Province. Therefore, Fu became the chairman of Suiyuan Province.</p>
<p>After he took office in Suiyuan, due to the circumstances, he was constantly reminding himself. After the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese invaders gradually encroached. Finally, in 1932, Jehol Province was in crisis, and the large county of Chahar East declared independence in the name of autonomy; at this point, the position of Suiyuan became even more important. At that time, in the face of an extremely difficult mission, he did not hesitate to work hard, training troops day and night and integrating with the people, and prepared to go to war at any time. As a result, the enemy's conspiracy was crushed.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Liu Ruming, chairman of Chahar Province, suddenly defected and remained idle, causing General Tang Enbo, who was defending Nankou, to be in urgent need of support on the flank. Therefore, he urgently transferred the garrison in Suiyuan to support, but Liu refused to let them pass through. Fu immediately sent telegrams to Liu Ruming to explain the misunderstanding, but there was no result. Nankou was painfully abandoned. When General Tang retreated to Suiyuan, he and Fu held each other and cried bitterly. The two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan also fell at this point!</p>
<p>After the fall of Suiyuan Provincial City, Fu, in the name of deputy commander of the war zone, led his brave soldiers to defend the country. Later, he was promoted to commander of the 12th War Zone. He always sat in the town of Suiyuan, stood on the front line and fought with the enemy. For eight years, he fought in the icy and snowy land, and he went through all kinds of hardships. He was really a hard-working general.</p>
<p>Last year, the War of Resistance against Japan was quietly coming to an end. The Communist army fired the first shot of the civil war and attacked Fu Zuoyi. At that time, he sent telegrams to Zhu De and Mao Zedong asking them to stop it: on the other hand, he sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang explaining the situation and hoping not to expand it into a civil war; however, the Communist army accused Fu of creating a civil war. Fu immediately declared his position and published the details, and declared that he was willing to resign from all military posts after the victory to express his loyalty to the country.</p>
<p>Now, the Communist army is re-enacting the tragedy of a year ago, so General Fu once again sent a telegram advising Mr. Mao Zedong not to do anything unscrupulously! We are all moved after reading General Fu's telegram. We love generals like Fu who care about the people, but we also hope that the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party will no longer use the means of "creating poverty" to achieve their goal of seizing power!</p>
