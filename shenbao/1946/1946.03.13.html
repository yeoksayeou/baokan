<h3>「汪第」內景</h3>
<p>— 本報南京特約記者　沈時</p>
<p>漢奸子女會談記（上）</p>
<p>陳逆璧君願「一死」</p>
<p>勝利以來，南京新聞記者沒有誰被允許看過任何被　的漢奸，自從陳逆公博，陳逆　君，及褚逆民誼等押解去蘇州以後，這兒的漢奸集中營寗海路二十五號，更失了擒賊先擒王的對象，大家也　得去鑽路子了。</p>
<p>昨天晚上，祀者接到電話，原來是敵偽產業處理局南京辦事處，邀我們若干記者，於今天去參觀汪逆精衛之子汪孟晋的房產接交，順便並可一遊汪逆·褚逆的南京邸第。不料意外收獲，一早趕到赤壁路四　，迎門的是汪逆精衛的三女兒汪文恂，並於談話中，看到了　下一張陳逆　君的獄中遞書：</p>
<p>一高等法院，決不請律師，如判次死刑，亦不上訴，以表吾人非　死，及爲一切而作和平運動，其他毀謗，均不辯必自明。但願個個人受死刑後諸和運同志及因和運而累及之人們，均早日釋放，否則國家犧牲過大。政府不常注意其個人，亦常念其家屬，因其在外之家人，實較被扣者爲苦。悲憤窮困之餘，老者轉乎溝壑，少者逼入歧途，不可不愼也一</p>
<p>「至於本人，死是死得起，但牢是坐不起，因此兩年來諸病按次而發，六個月中更是無不一日不與病魔鬥。醫藥之貴，更不可久囚，如判次不死，則是否上訴，便須看徒刑之久暫矣。最好是死刑一了百了。外問之氣也洩，同志或因璧君之死，氣已洩，而得釋放。但不論如何，不必再爲家人及苦我兒女之養我，個人公私之願均遂矣，故死次不上訴一。</p>
<p>上面這些字是寫在一張舊毛邊紙上的。字跡潦草，墨色很淡，勾劃甚多，據汪女說，這是他最近去蘇州探望陳逆璧君時，雖未得晤面，總算得了這張親筆字條，因此他視爲至寳，不願示人，經記者再三要求，才由汪子孟晋之妻由手提包中拿了出來。我們看了之後，覺得雖然滿紙高調，但仍不失爲新聞資料。最後並問在文恂，對其母命，是否遵辦，汪女圓滑地說，「我們身爲人子的，當然得看那時情形再定了」。</p>
<p>汪文恂賣枕頭套？</p>
<p>赤璧路四號，是南京住宅區內普通上等房子之一，據說這是汪逆家人被探出頤和路三十四號邸第後，臨時租質的。屋內什物顯得很零亂，但零亂中仍不失一股富貴氣。汪逆一家，除本人已死，陳璧君繫獄蘇州外；長子孟晋，次子文悌，長女文惺，長婿何文傑及一二歲外甥，一起被囚在憲海路二十五號。目前與汪女同住的，家人只有孟晋之妻譚文素，及其兩個女小孩，另外有褚逆民誼長女孟媛，和二個所謂「同學」，在伴着他們的寂寞。譚文素是個典型的廣東女人，矮小，害羞，不會說普通話。褚孟媛是粗綫條，鄉下土氣十足，深得乃父乃母之遺傳。因此我們談話之對手，自然只有落到在述之女文恂身上。</p>
<p>提起這位汪文恂，據我們與他對談二十分鐘話之後，所得的印象，覺得確實足爲在逆之女而無愧。二十三歲，丰姿楚楚，偽廣州大學敎育學院畢業，在廣州獨力辦過工讀社，去日本養過病。在逆死時也在床側。說一口流利的北平話，辯才無碍，口若懸河。起先是答覆記者的問話，末後居然好像演說起來了似的，爲伊「先父」的「和平運動」，大大閘發了一番。結論是「中國歷史好以成敗論英雄，但我對先父，始終認爲他老人家是個失敗的愛國者」。其間一揮手，一彎腰，姿態萬千。據熟悉汪逆的同業先輩說，簡直活像汪精衛，但她堅決拒絕爲她拍照，說是從來沒有被拍過照。據她訴說，自從勝利以後，她爲父親的墳墓被毀事，幾乎找遍了來到南京的每個軍政首長，並日還寫了同樣的五封長信，用各種方法分呈蔣主席，目的是要收回汪逆屍骨。據說，汪逆墳墓自去年十一月二十二日被毀後，迄今未打聽得死骨下落。說得到，做得到，眞是這種女子。例如，當記者們說是要一看他家供着的汪逆靈堂，她還爲所謂「應有的禮貌」問題，與我們爲難了半天。</p>
<h3>二全會紀念總理逝世　蔣總裁親政訓詞　勉以和平奮鬥建設新中國</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十二日電〕二中全會今日上午九時舉行總理逝世紀念，總裁主席，行禮如儀後，即席致詞，首先提出國父逝世時和平奮鬥救中國之遺敎，認爲吾人目前對於救國建國之任務，必須以此遺敎爲努力之中心。換言之，吾人必須以和平方法，達到我奮鬥之目的，一方面要寬大容忍，推誠置信，一方面要堅定吾人革命建國之信心，一方面必須認淸時代與環境，切實爲民服務，解除民衆之痛苦，使民衆能認識吾人爲國奮鬥之精誠，與吾人速接一體共同努力解救國家之危難，完成三民主義新中國之建設，庶不負國父諄諄垂示之苦心。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕京各機關首長於國父逝世廿一週紀念上午八時，展謁國父陵寢，由陸軍總部　參謀長毅肅主祭，全體與祭者行禮致祭後，繞棺一匝面退。市民自由前往瞻仰國父遺容者極踴躍，京各界代表千餘人，晨在大華戲院舉行植權節紀念大會，市府陳秘書長祖平在會塲宣布，市府即將擬具十年造林計劃，期使十年後之南京成一林木蓊鬱之都市。會後各代表復於細雨霏霏中赴靑凉山植樹，市府擬於該地造一山林公園，一面則紀念抗戰勝利，一則紀念國父在抗戰勝利後之首次忌辰。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美駐華軍事顧問團團長麥克魯將軍，十二日晨十時赴總理陵寢，展謁致敬，並代表在華美軍全體官兵敬獻花圈。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津十二日電〕美第三水陸部隊司令洛基，今日於總理逝世紀念在此間招待記者，以孫總理與美國國父華盛頓相媲美，並稱：「於茲孫總理逝世紀念日，美國人民實與諸君共同希望，統一之中國即將成爲諸君努力之成果」。今日之紀念，並當使諸君母忘常前重大責任，予及司令部全體人員，願與諸君共同紀念，並願諸君成功。</p>

<p>第三應付的方略，是儘速恢復交通運輸，在抗戰勝利後，政府首重恢復交通，但因國內各地有反對政府的隊伍，集中力量，破壞鐵路，破壞煤礦，長江以北各重要鐵路綫屢次修復，屢次破壞，因此平漢，津浦，隴海等幹綫，從未修通，現在情形改變，交通部已努力於修復工作，並且已在國外訂購鋼軌廿八萬噸，枕木四百萬根，洋灰三十萬噸，不久即可運到，關於此項材料，非，我國缺少，各國為戰後之需要但互相競爭購買，所以雖盡極大努力，也祗能分批運來，與戰前祗要有款購買即可供給的情形，大不相同，關於船舶方面，我國沿海沿江之船隻，包括中外所有在內，總噸數的爲一百五十萬噸，經過這次戰爭，祗剩十餘萬噸，所以水上交通，幾等於零，戰事結束以後，各國所有者，大都爲海洋駛行船隻，至於沿沿江海駛用的船隻極少，我國業已分向各國購買，美國本有大量船隻，但因美國出售剩餘船隻，必須由國會通過，手續須經幾個月之久，政府竭盡一切方法，已購到及長期租用船隻共計三十七萬餘噸，已有一部份到達，此外尚在途中，現在陸續接洽添購大量船隻，同時善後救濟總署方面，亦在租用船隻，及購買登陸艇，以利水上運輸，在過去日本曾賴船舶運輸業與紡織業之聯絡，向回外吸收大量外匯，現在日本旣已崩潰，我國船舶，今後除國內自用外，不應忽略對南洋運輸業之大財源，關於公路方面，經八年苦戰之後，各公路破壞者甚多，現在已在分區修復，我國原有卡車，大多數多已陳舊不堪，現在政府已經購妥卡軍二萬五千輛，在最近期內可以運到，此後公路運輸，可以逐漸加强，增進及恢復交通計劃，業已決定，此後祗要努力執行，雖然此種工作，都有時間限制，但可希望必能日益改善。</p>
<p>開放對外貿易採用彈性匯率</p>
<p>第四，應付方案，是開放對外貿易，政府所規定之官價外匯，對美金爲廿比一，這已行之多年，此種比率，與一般市塲完　全脫節，因此對外貿易，幾乎完全停頓，最近國防最高委員會，於上星期一，通過開放對外貿易辦法，行政院即於同日公佈施行，其主要意義，就是暫時採用有彈性的匯兌率，等過了相常時期，再決定一永久性的匯兌率，本月四日起，已將匯兌辦法決定實行，現在外匯及一切物價，都顯有相當決定，外匯開放以後，對外貿易，便可暢通為。各項物資尤可隨人民的需要而增加，游資之游入投機市塲，以助長物價之波動者，亦可納入商業正軌，國外原料及機械，也可因對外貿易之恢復，源源進口，來配合國內工業之發展，足以使增加生產，並收平定物價的效果，所以開放對外貿易在國內可以安定人心，在國外可以導引投資，予我經濟建設，以重要的助力，本席對於經濟財政金融，素來不敢多發表意見，但對於此次政府開放對外貿易辦法，覺得確有把握，我國輸出輸入之數量，可就戰前的統計爲依據，現在旣己有，外國期信用貸欵，可購取大批　長物又有善後救濟的大量物資輸入，今後輸出入之金額，無疑的可以相抵，本席曾聽有不明內容的人說，政府所撥美金五億元之法幣準備金三個月可以用盡，本席敢員責鄭重的說，現在採取的辦法，可以長期保持運用，絕對沒有枯竭的危險。</p>
<p>克服一切困難樹立經濟基礎</p>
<p>本席相信，本黨由總裁領導，獲得了抗戰勝利，也一定能够領導全國人民，向建設的大道邁進，現在克復常前經濟環境的方案，已經有了此種方案，雖然是平常的，而且需要相當時期的，但確是脚踏實地的，本席確信我們如用對於抗戰的同樣決心，必能克復一切困難，在今後兩個月能稍見功效，四個月後，能更有進步，可能在本年年底將國家經濟建設的準備工作，樹立基礎。</p>

<h3>專論　修改憲草原則私見</h3>
<p>— 吳尙鷹</p>
<p>政治協商會議，關於憲法部門，有憲草原則之修改，並組織憲草審議委員會，根據修改原則，並奪酌憲政期成會修正案，憲政實施協進會研討結果，及各方面所提出之意見，彙綜整理製成五五憲草修正案，提供國民大會採納。本人以專家資格，參加審議會，聽到各方意見，多集中於國民大會與立法行政關係兩問題，並各有不同見解，其所以不同的重要原因，蓋在接受與不接受總理權能學說之意義，而表面又要說接受三民主義五權憲法的遣敎。在此若可若之矛盾思想中，實有難於自圓其說之苦。再從事實言之，各黨派難免各有其木身利害關係，所以要修改五五憲草之原因，或在此而不在彼；故又諉爲政治問題，旣有許多矛盾事實存於其間，則非理論可通者矣。</p>
<p>茲請以最客觀態度，排除黨的偏見與情感來看這問題，表示些意見，藉供參考，一得之愚，或爲黨國賢達所許也。</p>
<p>關於五五憲草規定國民大會與中央政制兩章，政治協商會議有以此種制度爲問接民權，不能達到民主政治目的；故有擬議立法院之構成分子應由選民商接選舉，其職權相當於各民主國家之議會。行政院院長之任命，由總統提請立法院同意，對立法院負責；如立法院對行政院全體不信任時，行政院長或解職，或提請總統解散立法院。這個辦法與原五五憲草執爲適宜，應作比較研究，茲舉其不同之要點言之：</p>
<p>（一）在原五五憲草之行政院長，副院長，政務委員，各那部長，各委員會委員長，由總統任免，各對總統負責；而總統因係山闕民大會選出，對國民大會負其責任。</p>
<p>（二）在政治協商決定之修改原則，行政院全體對立法院負責；而立法院則由選民直接選舉而來，立法院對行政院全體不信任時，行政院長或解職或請總統解散立法院，以示負責之意。</p>
<p>（三）在五五憲草之國民火會有罷免總統，副總統，立法，司法，考試，監察各院院長，副院長，立法委員，監察委員之權；因均係由國民大會選舉而來，所以國民大會對之有罷免權，此係表示各該員對國民大會負責之意。</p>
<p>觀上列諸點，五五憲草之國民大會，係代表國民行使中央統治權，對於中央官員有選舉罷免之權；遇行政立法兩院發生糾紛，於必要時，以罷免方法解決之，對總統地位與威信固不損及，於國家政務亦不致陷於停滯，政府地位無動蕩不安之虞</p>
<p>今政治協商泱定之修改原則：行政院對立法院負責，立法院對行政院全體不信任時，行政院長或解職，或請總統解散立法院，在立法院被解散時；必要另行改選，在改選期中，政務必陷於停滯狀態，而選舉費時，影響政務尤大，即於平時亦必有政潮起伏政局動蕩不安之情形，何如由國民大會行使龍免權，直捷了當迅速解決之。</p>
<p>主張立法行政採取不信任與解散之衡制辦法者，其理由以立法院旣爲直接民選機關，行政院對之負責，比較近於民主政治之理想，而五五憲草之總統與立法院，均由國民大會選舉而來，此外罷免創制複決之權，均由國民大會而不由人民直接行使，立法院對國民大會負責，而行政院對總統負責，皆爲間接民權，與民主政治理想，距離較遠。</p>
<p>吾人應知中國現時所最需要者，爲政局之安定，獨裁專制，使人民不滿，不能爲全民謀福利；固不能達到政局安定之目的。若政潮起伏，政府常在動蕩狀態，亦不能達到政局安定之目的。民國初年國會糾紛之經騐，可爲殷鑒；是以五五憲草之國民大會制度，或與歐美之議會政治不同，民權之行使或為間接，而總比議會制減少政潮起伏與政局動蕩之虞。同時對德統以下之官吏，可作有效之監啊，不致流爲獨裁。總理對於歐美各國政制，經多年之比較研究，得此結論，定爲建國大綱，實值得闕人愼重考慮，不必泥於歐美成例，爲偏見所困，使民國初年錯誤重演也。</p>
<p>或謂五五憲草之國民大會代表任期六年，在第五第六年時，已不能反映當時正確民意；此又可縮短其任期，或倣美國上院議員選舉法，每一年或二年改選若干分子，便可使民意溝通，補救之法正多也。</p>
<p>總而言之，政制無絕對之美，根本之圖，仍在實行地方自洽，培養民力，使爲憲政之有效擁護者，方可希望到民主之路。總理於建國大綱第三項云：「其次爲民權，故對於人民之政治知識能力，政府常訓導之，以行使其選舉權，行使其罷免權，行使其創制權，行使其複決權」。此後各黨各派對於培養民力民智之艱鉅任務，應共同負起責任，建立此民主基礎，則憲政實施，自有其光明前途也。</p>
<p>說到所謂內閣制總統制等名詞，查內閣制發源於英國，或稱爲議會政府，而英人每稱爲責任政府，以下議院多數黨組織內閣執政；其閣員均爲下院議員，行政立法職務，兼而有之，於其政策不得下議院信任，或不通過其提出預算，或其他法案時，內閣或辭職，或請解散國會，訴諸全國公民，另行選舉。此制由英國逐漸行於荷蘭·法蘭西·比利時·羅馬尼亞·瑞典。挪威。丹麥。希臘諸邦，而據美國伊利諾大學政治學敎授加爾納所著之「政治學與政府」一書，其內閣政府章云：「即中國與日本亦略有此制度之色彩」云。</p>
<p>所謂總統制者，行於美國，並爲多數拉丁美洲國家所採行。總統之權力任期，均規定於憲章；彼有選擇其行政人員（或可直稱爲其行政屬員）之全權，不受國會干涉，惟任命時須經國會形式上之通過而已。全部行政人員，均對總統負責；蓋總統則行政首長，有請國會審議其提出之法律預算及吾決國會決議之權，但無解散國會使另行改選之權。</p>
<p>總理對美國總統制，頗多稱許；其所得之憲法理想，有採自美國制者，五五憲草對於總統職塵之規定，略染美國色彩，有所本也。然美國總統無解散國會權，倘行政立法兩者發生衝突時，祇可山總統善用其威望，將其主張訴諸全國人民，如到處公開演講，或如近年故羅斯福總統用爐邊談話等方式，所以總統制政府，有賴於總統人格與成望者正多。總理所主張採用之國民大會，界以選舉罷免創制複次等權，使行政立法兩方發生衝突時，訴諸國民大會，正所以救總統制之窮。現政治協商會議對於國民大會原則，提出修正各點，實有重加考慮之必要；母怪其引起國內賢達之注意。但有對五五憲草批評，未盡允當者，如大公報本月十四日社論，竞謂五五憲草爲最不民主之憲法，實欠考慮也。</p>
<p>或者以總理之五權憲法，祇可行於一黨制之政府，昔年總理決定五權憲法之原則時，或未想到國內多數政黨之存在。傳斯年先生乃講到運用多黨政治，除議會政治外，實想不到他途。本人以爲不必這樣看法。五權憲法之國民大會，爲代表人民行使中央統治權之最高機關；其構成分子，由全國選民以普通平等直接方法選舉而來，各黨各派，可自由競選，多黨政治，就可以運用，並不偏於一黨政治也。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，民國三十五年來之政治經騐，所以未能達到憲政政治者，不在有無憲法或好壞憲法的問題，而在憲法能否有效的問題。說者有謂憲法不適國情，所以不能實行；應之曰唯唯吾吾，試問憲法規定總梳要對天下公開宣誓，擁護民國，是否違背中國道德，不合國情，而袁世凱竟敢做洪憲皇帝矣。又試問奉公守法爲國家人民服務之法律，是否違反我數千年先聖先賢之敎訓，是否不適國情，而官吏貪汚，日有所聞矣。我國古聖賢說得好：「旣庶矣，又何加焉，曰富之；旣富矣，又何加焉，曰敎之。」今我國擁有四萬萬五千萬之人口，是旣庶矣，而能免飢寒者試問有幾份之幾，所以政府第一的責任，是使人人有謀生的機會。管子曰：「倉　寔然後知禮節，民不足而可治者，自古及今，未之嘗聞。」必使人人有覓食的機會，然後可以談到强迫敎育，使人人有受敎育的機會，人人有了飯食，有了智識，他們自然要問政治，自然達到民主之路。那個時候，無論袁世凱或四萬萬五千萬同胞任何一個人，亦不敢再演洪憲把戲。一般官吏，不敢貪汚，亦不必貪汚；講來講去，先要大家有飯吃。總理建國大綱第二項云：「建國之首要在民生，故對於全國人民之食、衣、住、行四大需要，政府常與人民協力，共謀晨業之發展，以足民食，共謀織造之發展，以裕民衣，建築大計劃之各式屋舍，以樂民居，修治道路運河，以利民行。」第三項乃講到其次為民權的話，照總理的說法，亦以民生爲先，所以人民無飯吃，則民權無基礎。此次抗戰勝利，我盟邦共同宣言，各國領袖政治家大聲疾呼，亦以提高人民生活標準爲第一事；誠以國以民爲木，民以食爲天，祇有認定此旨，實行做去，不空言，不掩飾，由木黨全黨同志共赴此的，以定此民主政治之基礎，則三民主義之理想，自然變成事實；憲政制度，亦必日趨美善。國家和平可期，世界火同可至。所謂信仰自由，言論自由，無貧乏自由，無恐懼自由，亦盡在其中矣。</p>

<h3>川省工業化前提　首須解決交通問題　四川金融家楊粲三來滬談話</h3>
<p>（本報訊）記者昨訪四川金融鉅子楊粲三，楊氏為聚興誠銀行董事長，該行分支行　設長江流域各城市，其本人甫由後方來滬，所談各點，略誌如下：</p>
<p>（一）外匯：據楊氏云，渝市雖亦已開放外匯，但因手續麻煩，故申請者未見如何踴躍.內地遊資則紛紛趨向上海，原因則以本市拆息較高，且資金運用途徑亦較廣。</p>
<p>（二）川省之建設：建設四川計劃，戰前早為楊氏等有職之士所提倡。工業化之前提，首須解決交通問題，四川全省之公路雖已可稱暢通，但對外仍屬阻礙重重，以致不易輸入機械，即使工業品製成之後，運銷亦必大為困難。現在川省人才集中，原料亦多，但須俟交通問題解決，始可向工業化之途邁進。預計至少須待數年之後，方能稍有眉目。</p>
<p>（三）長江流域之出口業：該區物產　　戰後人心振奮，紛圖恢復以前之出口貿易，故沿江各城市有大量該項企業成立，惟瞻望前途，未許樂觀。目前我國惟豬髮一項可以大量輸出，絲茶等產量大見低落，且在運輸問題未解決以前，亦難望發展。</p>
<p>綜合楊氏所談，解決交通為各項問題之首要，例如救濟總署物品抵滬，不易運入內地。運輸不便，以致內外物價差額太大，資金動盪，影響整個金融。</p>

<h3>卡車偷運銅鐵　匪徒發槍拒捕　截獲巨型運輸車四輛　除司機小工外均兎脫　吳淞深夜槍聲</h3>
<p>吳淞張華浜徐家宅日商中華鋼鐵廠，所出貨品大多屬於軍需者。勝利後，出　　委員會派員前往接收，廠中堆置</p>
<p>鋼鐵原料　甚多，最近數月來，遭偷竊不下十餘次之多。機械生財損失繁重。吳潑區保衛團第三大隊第九中隊，距離該廠不過二里之遙，每晚出動巡邏，以資　戒，前晚七時半，保衛團員約二十名巡查出勤，至九時十五分許，該見　門首有一巨型卡車，上載大批鋼鐵，出該廠駛出。當經團員喝令停駛未遂，詎車上匪徒竟</p>
<p>發槍拒捕　團員還擊，歷十餘分鐘，約共四五十發，並無死傷。南首西唐橋警察派出所驟開槍响，即由郭巡官率領全體長警，循聲而至。孰知黑暗中開槍之匪徒已經逸去。衹截獲一四三六三號.三五六八一號.三五七四一號.</p>
<p>運輸卡車　三輛及四一〇五六號巨型吉普卡一輛。司機者高鞠生.張金桃.黃壽生.等三華人，另一白俄名德姆沙夫。連同小工十四名，一併拘入派出所。於翌晨解送江灣分局核辦。當出事時，上海市管總局，曁該管分局，先後得電話報告，曾撥派警備車下鄉闖勦。因天雨泥濘，到達時已十一時。記者昨往出事地點調查，據保衛團第九中隊長錢嘉福，曁中隊副姜　　云，該處四週</p>
<p>倉庫林立　竊案層出不窮。彼輩持有武器，明目張瞻，直放卡車數輛，預停於門首，然後破扉而入，將看守者一一捆綁，搬運大量物資，於天未破曉時，上車而逸。前後如同一轍。又據江灣分局分局長于傑告稱，事實大略相同，惟一美式吉普卡已由美方竊領駛去，上載藏物銅鐵若干　，及其餘</p>
<p>運輸汽車　三輛，尚存置此地。大致此項車輛或係運輸車行租來，因竊查之警員尚未返來，宋悉真相。據捕獲之車夫供稱，衹知下鄉裝運小麥，不知偷竊銅鐵，記者詢渠該案解送市警局抑警備總司令部，據告，須徹查該案之始末經過，再行決定.至在逃之主犯，已着司法設　緝歸案究辦。</p>

<p>百貨公司　（本報訊）永安等十大百貨公司工潮，經社會局決定，職工底薪最高六十元，依生活指數計算。故各公司於星期一起，即行復工。但資方認為未能滿意，擬申請另行仲裁。職工等聞此訊後，昨日再度集合代表至社會局請願，由張課長接見，並稱：當盡力維持已定原則云。</p>
<p>旅館工人　本市旅館業因百物飛漲，故關於房金會呈請社會局核准，增加四成。惟該業對工人工資，則並不遞增，致該業工人小組代表，紛向工會責問，要求應照房價成數增給。工會當即函請該業公會答復，至昨日各旅館對工資問題仍無動靜，聞各工人認為故意延宕，以怠工對付。</p>
<p>呢絨工潮　（本報訊）本市各呢絨時裝號業職工，除由資方供膳外，並無薪水，僅藉顧客定製衣服內，扣取裏佣。今因百物飛漲，職工等待聯合向資方要求另支薪津，條件為：　馬路湖北路店號之職工，分四萬，五萬，六萬，三級工資支付。霞飛路，同孚路，店號之職工，分五萬，六萬，七萬，三級工資支付。南京東路西路店號之職工，分八萬，九萬，十萬，三級支付。職工自於九日向店方提出要求後，資方以職工所得裏佣，本超出此數，今又作此要求，自未能予以接受。職工因要求未遂，昨日起，鴻翔時裝公司等數十家職工，即實行怠工。</p>

<h3>美敎育委會建議　修正博士學位程序</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十一日電〕據紐約時報訊：美敎育委員會最近建議修改接受博士學位程序，及積極改善美國大學研究院設施，俾從事研究高深學問之莘莘學子得獲較大之便利。美敎育處高級專家霍里斯，曾進行調查研究院工作情形，渠指出美國高等敎育機關之大學研究院辦理不善。霍氏之報告書強調美國一般研究院，產生過多眼光狹隘之專家，彼輩所受敎育，幾局限於適應職業上之專門技術。依霍里斯之意見，研究工作之訓練，鮮有令一般學子在彼等職業範圍內，獲得豐富之個人與社會生活。</p>
<p>（指摘博士論文）渠建議研究工作應尋源於學者之個人與職業上興趣。僅為符合學位條件而作之博士論文，對於學問並無裨益，且反足令彼等所受敎育淪於狹隘。霍里斯博士分析自一九三〇年至一九四〇年間，接受博士學位之二萬二千五百零九人紀錄，發現其中百分之六十五在各大學担任敎職，百分之二十從事工業研究工作，百分之十在政府機關任事，百分之五則在大學以下學校任敎。獲博士學位者百分之十三，其工作與彼所受訓練渾不相關，或無需大學以上之高深知識。統共有百分之廿七，投入敎育界以外事業。據霍里斯博士訪問此輩獲有博士學位者之僱主結果，一致認為於選擇及培育學員之時，應對彼等之個性予以較大之注意。</p>
<p>（不限智力訓練）諸人強調與他人和表合作之能力，及發展對社會責任之正常敏感性，實與專門技術同為事業成功之要素。霍里斯博士結論稱，未來十年中，社會將需要數量較少，唯具有較為健全之敎育與能勝任實際工作之博士，渠特建議，未來博士所受訓練，範圍應加擴大，而不應斤斤以智力訓練為已足。</p>

<h3>無國之痛！　長春學生代表抵平聲述</h3>
<p>〔大華社北平訊〕關山跋涉，冒險來平之東北長春軍官學校等八校男女學生五百餘人，刻已有十餘人到達平市，天津尙有三十餘人，大部滯留錦縣。頃據來平之東北各大學代表談稱：勝利以前，各大學學生多被敵偽強迫，派赴各處服務，八一五以後，一時交通未能恢復，故學生形成散處狀態，其後始漸集中長春。九月初即由學生本身籌組補習學校，同時大學聯盟亦繼之成立。</p>
<p>一致議決總撤退</p>
<p>不意東北問題日益複雜，當經五百餘學生開會一致議決，由長春總撤退，經濟陽而赴北平。上月二十日早起，分批由長春乘車赴瀋，晚間全部抵達。因國軍眞能控制之地尙在皇姑屯，故又分批向皇姑屯移動。旋即乘車到達錦縣，由東北保安司令部代備食宿。又因種種困難，祗能少數陸續來此。現已與敎部東北地區特派員接洽，據云東北臨時大學補習班將設錦縣，故留錦同學即可停止前途。彼等來平之目的，首要者為希望當局能給予適當之工作，其次則為嶺書。</p>
<p>不願再作亡國奴</p>
<p>同學等身經萬苦十四年，深感無國之痛，今後決不能再作亡國奴，而東北黑水白山之豐蘊實藏，更誓死不能放棄。東北同學物</p>
<p>有多人組織武裝團體，與不法部隊周旋，更有同學於國軍駐時掩護登陸，可證東北同學愛國之殷云。</p>
<h3>敎育界慘史校長失踪　爲了學校生活無法維持</h3>
<p>〔本報仙居訊〕仙居縣立簡易師範學校，因該縣田賦豁免，該校學生公糧無着，開學至今，學生來校者甚稀，敎職員月薪微薄，已聘定之敎師皆各自他去。該校校長王相驥，迭次請求縣府設法補救，未能解決，並以學生所繳之學食各米，縣府給予代收，敎職員月薪，縣府規定發給一萬元至一萬六千元，若不照此辦理，則敎職員月薪，縣府不加顧問。該校長因感辦理如此困難，無法維持，經又向縣府續請辭職不准，詎料本月一日，該校長忽然失踪，迄無音訊，據其長女謂：渠父（即校長）平生向不在外過宿，是日下午二時，自稱往街上有事一走，竟不歸來，音訊杳然。並云：渠父臨走，並未攜帶行囊，身邊又無分文，且留有辭別書三封：一給祖父，略云：「父親！不肖覺有與人寰長離之必要，請毋以此為念，善視兒婦腹中肉，兒驥手筆。」一給校中同事者，內云：「訓育，教育，事務，三主任台鑒：鄙人因對校務辦理無能，故與汝等長辭，縣府在未派人接收以前，當請三主任勞神辦理，毋以鄙人不幸為念，王相驥手啓。」一給縣府與公函同呈，乃最後之辭呈書也。故其家屬自該校長失踪後，間卜求神，鬧得天哭地泣，各處尋覓，行踪杳然，恐已凶多吉少云。（羽）</p>

<p>提到同濟大學，首先在別人腦海上浮現的，就是一幅緊張的圖畫：在同濟特有作風的實習大工廠內，一個個不同面貌的青年，在不同的實習時間內，揮動着不同的工具，駕駛着不同的機械，穿了藍色的工人服，滿身都是油漬，流着汗，親自踏踏實實地刻苦實習。在敎室裏，解剖室裏，或自修室裏，甚至今日的茶館裏，一個個健壯的青年，拿着不同的參考書，幾乎相同的儀器，緊張地，靜悄悄的，自己一個人埋着頭研究一個人的。</p>
<p>（戰後遷到四川李莊）李莊在一個較大的谷地裏，江水從西北角的谷裏流出，向李莊辭別似的，在李莊前戀戀不捨地　了一個大灣，然後滔滔地流向東方，流向她——同濟將要回去的老家。李莊的背後是山，長江的對面也是山，她有恬靜的幽香，也有秀麗的清甜。這裏除同濟外，有中央研究院歷史研究所，中國博物院，中央研究院地理研究院大地測量組，及中央研究院社會研究院所的一部份，這裏離重慶約一千華里，這是最適合學者們研究的地方。這裏在抗戰中從沒有跑過一次　報，同濟因此從沒有受過舊報的騷擾。</p>
<p>同濟已經有三十九年的歷史了。但同濟不曾鬧過任何風潮，也不曾參加過任何校外的甚麼活動。同濟一貫的校風，就是「埋頭苦幹」，同學從不願花任何一點時間，去喊沒有意義的空口號，像一池湖水，對外物永是靜靜的。春天來了，是這樣，夏天來了仍是這樣，秋天燕子來尋覓「春」的蹤影的時候，燕子可還得問這靜靜的綠水。抗戰前，在吳淞是這樣，抗戰後，經過了砲火的洗禮，現在在長江之西，仍是這樣，並越更變得沉默。</p>
<p>（絕不送迎任何校長）一個同濟的老敎授，在一次公開的講演，曾這樣說過：「今日（斯時正在抗戰期中），國家在這樣的困難當中，仍抽出大部份的經費給我們唸書，我們更應努力，我們更應發揚同濟的校風，我們更要苦幹，實幹，快幹，硬幹……」連着幾個「幹」字，把同學的「心」感動得只是跳。同濟幾十年來，變換的校長不少，但同學從沒有挽留過任何校長，也沒有哄走過任何校長，而且任何校長初來學校，也沒有任何同學去歡迎過，或來後開一會歡迎會。每一個同學的心，自從跨進同濟門檻後，便深深的刻下一個「實幹，苦幹，硬幹」的鈴印，決定讀書，就先把書讀好了再說。同學們的心，整天總是整個的放在書本上，工廠裏，或研究室中，同學們的心，永遠總是像農人們一樣的誠樸。</p>

<h3>英蘇兩國勢力範圍間的橋樑　國際新關係的音鍵　土耳其問題檢討</h3>
<p>本報特稿　譯自英國皇家外閃學院『今日之世界』月刊</p>
<p>土耳其實際爲英蘇兩國勢力範圍問的一條橋樑。土耳其政局的變遷，對於世界各國都有重大關係，能藉以看出英蘇兩國間的眞賞了解究竟達到如何程度。自從十九世紀以來，土耳其的海峽和外高加索邊疆就成爲國際關係的試音報：由海峽，可以看出列强之間的關係；由外高加索邊疆，可以看出蘇　之間的關係。換一句話說，依照歷史光例，只有在蘇土之間已因海峽問題而發生磨擦時，外高加索邊疆才成爲『問題』，這問題向爲蘇上關係中的主要爭點，且因西方各國爲利益衝突，參與干涉，而更趨複雜化。</p>
<p>據此而論，最近蘇聯所提對於喀斯和阿達漢的領土要求（注：據一月十七日土外長廣播稱，蘇方並未正式提出變更領土的要求。）以及喬治亞大學敎授所提更爲過份的對於黑海沿岸一帶領土的要求，可以解釋爲莫斯科所施的外交壓力，迫令土耳其接受蘇聯對於修改</p>
<p>『蒙德婁海峽協定』</p>
<p>所抱的見解。不管怎樣，這是很淸楚的，目前在蘇土之間正有一種神經戰在進行着，其間，邊疆要求祗是一部份。同時，外高加索領土要求須認爲係中東一般問題之一環，與蘇聯在這一區域所持政策的其他各點有關，尤其是她所渴求的後門方面的安全。</p>
<p>至於海峽問題，那末『蒙德婁協定』的修正，是應由各國共同來負責決定的，並非祗是蘇土兩國自身的事情。但蘇聯旣是一個强國，她在促進國際合作上至少總有一點力量。現在土耳其不得不扮演一個被動的角色。關於這一點，蘇聯辯稱，在戰事期問，土耳共就自己選擇這個被動的角色的，並且說，土耳其的中立對於德國賞在是非常有利的。土耳其的中立曾由伊諾奴總統於一九四五年十一月一日國民大會開會式中發表演說，加以辯護，他强調申述，土耳其曾拒絕德國的要求，不許她接近中東和蘇聯的高加索邊界；並且說，土耳其已經忠實地履行了『蒙德婁協定』。</p>
<p>烏克蘭在此次戰爭中曾遭受到慘重的損失，再也經不起外來的攻擊了。蘇聯爲保障後門安全起見，認爲</p>
<p>蘇土關係的舊基礎</p>
<p>很不滿意，所以便在一九四五年三月十九日公開指摘一九二五年簽訂的『蘇土條約』。那時蘇聯曾發表正式聲明，宣稱『蘇聯政府固承認一九二五年十二月十七日所訂的蘇土條約對於維持蘇土友善關係之價値，但認爲吾人必須注意，目前情勢業已大變，尤以第二次大戰時期爲甚，因之，此項條約業已不能切合時勢，亟需根本加以修正』。蘇聯大使與土耳其外長在六月間的會談中，蘇聯政府似曾提出另訂新約的三項先決條件：（一）一九二一年割讓給土耳其的喀斯和阿達漢應歸還給蘇聯；（二）允許蘇聯在黑海海峽設立基地，讓蘇聯參與海峽的防務；（三）修改『蒙德婁協定』。七月間，上外長由舊金山回國，途經倫敦，曾以備忘錄一件致英政府，並以副份致美政府，闡明土耳其的意見。土耳其表示，只要她的主權不受侵害，安全不受成脅，她是願意在國際監督之下，保證各國船隻自由通過海峽的。同時，她表示希望蘇土關係也應一併解決，以免日後再起糾紛。土總統伊諾奴和土總理薩拉喬格魯均曾以堅强的語調來表明他們對於蘇聯所提邊疆要求的反響：『土耳其領土決不容任何人要求割讓；吾人生於光榮，決當死於光榮』。伊諾奴總統曾於十一月一日這樣說過。接着，薩拉喬格魯總理復於一月六日引證喀斯，阿達漢，和黑海沿岸一帶的最近史賞和人口數字，對於蘇聯所提的領土要求加以駁正。</p>
<p>在波茨坦會議中，曾通過一項決議，三强應分別與土耳其政府商討修改『蒙德婁協定』間題。美國（在十一月二日）和英國（在十一月廿三日）曾先後向土耳其提出修改建議，但英美的建議均不包含重大的變更。此一課題，在倫敦外長會議中和最近舉行的莫斯科會議中，均未經正式議及。</p>
<p>我們倘以遠大的目光來觀察，那末，去年所發生的種種政治行動就很難按現時的見解來解釋了，因爲由於原子武器的發明，所有古典的</p>
<p>戰略要塞之眞價值</p>
<p>業已完全變更了，蘇聯的行動，其實祗能使人記憶起十九世紀的戰略而已。</p>
<p>蘇聯對海峽的注意當追溯自舊土耳其帝國（Ｏttoman　Empire）的式微和俄國勢力向黑海方面的擴張。在一七七四年以前，黑海海峽完全在舊土耳其帝國的控制之下，可是自一七七四年簽訂『寇刦克·嘉音那其條約』以後，俄皇卡塞琳大帝就獲得土方特許，讓俄國商船通過海峽。自此，舊土耳其帝國的成權就日益式微，要不是地中海和歐洲各國（尤其是英國）出而干涉的話，俄國更可以提早獲得特許把戰艦通過海峽駛入地中海去了。俄國旣獲此項特權，西方各國也就接踵而來，效法俄國，欺侮孱弱的土耳其。於是奧大利，英國，法國普魯士，光後向土耳其取得特權，讓她們的商船得以自由通過海峽。一八二九年俄土戰爭結束，簽訂『亞得利亞堡條約』，承認俄國對於喬治亞和高加索各省的主權，一切中立國的商船均得自由通航於黑海及多瑙河。</p>
<p>因爲土耳其南部草原的產麥區日顯重要，她的黑海商業也隨之而日益擴展，並且黑海沿岸各港口又都是不凍港，促使俄國蓄意建立起一個黑海艦隊來，這艦隊應享有自由通過海峽的權利，却不容黑海沿岸其他各國涉足黑海。一面再用征服的方法，或使土皇淪於被保護的地位，或採用和平手段讓列强來瓜分這沒落中的舊土耳其帝國，俄國便可藉此取得君士坦了堡的統治權，把海峽置於俄國的管理之下。這種種擴張領土的計劃，英國，奧匈，和德國都表示反對，尤以英國爲甚，因爲東部地中海是英印交通的一條生命綫，對於英國尤有至高無上的價値。因此，英國便採取封鎖政策，禁止一切戰艦通過海峽，把俄國艦隊封閉在黑海衷。嗣後俄士復交，於一八三三年簽訂『恩基亞·斯蓋來西條約』，授權俄國派遣戰艦通過海峽，俾俄國得以履行她對於土耳其的任務·此後，根據一八四〇年『英俄普奧四國協定』（後來法國也參加簽字）的條款，外國戰艦復禁止通過海峽。土耳其那時已無權允許任何國戰艦破例通過海峽了。而且，在未獲簽字國同意之前，此項禁例也不容加以修改。至此，俄國才承認，</p>
<p>海峽事件有關全歐</p>
<p>俄土爭執也不僅僅是她們兩國自身的事情。俄國自克里米亞戰敗之後，不得在黑海中另建艦隊，也不得在黑海沿岸設立軍火廠，並且被迫割讓南比　比亞（一八五六年巴黎條約）。俄皇亞歷山大第二決意破除這種種桎楷，乘普法戰爭的機會，先廢除了有關俄國檻隊的條款。在一八七一年倫敦會議中，列强同意取消否決權，保證土耳其的獨立與完整，爲達到此項目的起見，並授權土皇，即使是在承平時期，也得准許外國戰艦通過海峽。一八七七——一八七八年俄土戰爭的結果，俄國收復了在『巴黎條約』下失去了的領土。</p>
<p>同時，因一八六九年蘇彝士運河的開放，而使英國的政策開始轉變，接着英國復於一八七八年取得塞普勒司，並在埃及獲得戰略基地，於是，她的政策就轉變得更積極了。德國在土勢力的擴展，以及因歐洲均勢之變遷而締結的英俄同盟（一九〇七），也使英國不得不改變她的政策。她現在主張海峽應予開放，各國戰艦均得自由通過海峽。然而，在一九一八年以前，海峽仍是在土耳其管理之下，在一九一一——一九一二年的意土戰爭期間，俄國曾因海峽臨時封鎖而</p>
<p>感受到嚴重的困難</p>
<p>因爲她百分之五十的海運出口貨都需要通過海峽。</p>
<p>同樣地，在一九一四——一九一八年的大戰期間，因土耳其封閉海峽，使俄國與西方協約國失去聯絡，也曾召致相當大的損失。鑒於軍事失敗的危機日迫，英法兩國才對俄表示識步，願將寸九世紀中不許俄國享有的一切特權都送給了她。在韃靼尼爾遠征軍開始作戰以前，英法俄三國於一九一五年三月十八日秘密簽訂了『君士坦丁堡協定』，規定如果協約國獲得勝利的話，俄國應佔有君士坦丁堡全部，博斯破魯斯兩岸，南色萊司至愛諾斯·米地亞一綫，音勃洛斯，藤耐度斯，和馬爾馬拉海中的某幾個島嶼。惟蘇聯領袖於推翻克倫斯基臨時政府後，曾於一九一七年十月間發表正式宣言，反對一切形式的併呑和帝國主義，並且擯斥一切俄皇所簽訂的秘密條約。</p>
<p>俄國退出歐戰，土耳其崩潰之後，海峽的管理權轉入協約國手中，協約國軍隊佔領了海峽沿岸的戰略要點，直至一九二三年，才根據『洛桑條約』的規定，把海峽置於一個國際委員會的管轄之下，並且撤除了博斯破魯斯，韃靼尼爾，以及馬爾馬拉海中各島嶼的軍備。不論平時或戰時，均准許商船自由通過的海峽，戰艦在平時也得通過，但限制任何國家不得以超過黑海艦隊之艦船通過海峽。在土耳其爲戰國一份子之戰爭中，中立國的戰艦及商艦如欲通過海峽時，由其自行負責·蘇聯出席洛桑會議代表在簽字時曾表示異議，蘇聯政府復拒絕批准此項條約。蘇聯主張不論平時或戰時，均不准戰艦通過海峽，可是西方各國却要海峽完全開放。調定的結果，却把蘇聯和土耳其拉在一起，共同反對西方各國，於一九二五年十二月十七日簽訂『蘇土條約』確立了兩國之間的新的友誼（這條約就是蘇聯最近所擯斥的）。根據此項條約，在受到第三國攻擊時，不得互採敵對行動。</p>
<p>兩國同意維持中立</p>
<p>此後十年間，少壯的土耳其共和國獲致和西方各國消除異見。一九三三年間，土耳其覺得對於自身和蘇聯的支援很有把握了時，才敢提議修改『洛桑條約』。一直到一九三六年，國際聯盟未能有效干涉意阿之爭和德國的重佔萊茵區時，西方各國方承認『洛桑條約』所提供的保證尙不够充分，不應當削弱土耳其在海峽方面的主權·因之，根據一九三六年七月二十日所簽訂的『蒙德霎協定』，土耳其得以重行武裝海峽地帶，撤銷國際委員會，究全恢復土耳其的主權。在平時，成在土耳其保持中立的戰爭中，各國商船均得自由通過海峽；在平時，戰艦的行動須受限制（這完全是有利於蘇聯的），在土耳其保持中立的戰爭中，任何交戰國的戰艦均不得通過海峽。</p>
<p>英美的意見，認爲在最近這次戰爭中，餘開一九四四年六月這一個時期，恊約國會責難土耳其，怪她不應該讓德國的武裝商船通過海峽逃人愛琴海中去之外，土耳其可算是已經忠實地履行了她在『蒙德婁協定』約束下的一切責任了。此種見解蘇聯却不能贊同，她認爲土耳其的中立毋寗是有利於德國的。英美似以爲『蒙德　協定』祇需弄得能够適應新的時代，並且和新的國際機構發生關繫，再把她的專門條文略事修改，俾與海軍技術的新發明相符，也就够了。蘇聯却以爲牠的整個基礎（就是土耳其在海峽方面的完整的主權）應當加以變更。英國今日的一般輿論以爲『蒙德婁協定』在平時已經算够好了，在戰時任何協定都是無用的，所以最要緊的還是防止戰爭。這對於蘇聯似乎有一點近於空口說白話，因爲她的邊疆在過去已經證明是脆弱不足恃的，現在正在執拗地</p>
<p>企求着邊疆的安全</p>
<p>呢。土耳其對於削弱她主權的這一個問題的意見，我們前面已經提起過了，依照一九三九年十月十九日簽訂的『三國條約』（有效期限十五年），英法兩國對於土耳其都應担負某種責任的。由於這段簡短的海峽問題之史的蘭述，我們可以看出，現時的局勢根本不是一個新發生的事件，可說是其由來也久矣了。</p>
<p>外高加索邊疆問題在過去所佔的地位是比較次要的，雖然這一爭端在蘇土兩國之間已經有七十餘年的歷史了。在一八七七——一八七八年的俄土戰爭之後，依據『聖斯丹芬諾條約』的規定，土耳其應把阿達漢·喀斯·巴統·和貝雅集各省割讓給俄國。然而受到了列强的干涉，乃以『柏林條約』來替代『聖斯丹芬諾條約』，把貝雅集還給土耳其，但承認巴統·喀斯·和阿達漢的割讓，以替代土耳其所無力償付的鉅額賠款。此碩領土移轉，不論是根據人種學的論點，或是依照當地居民的志願，都是不發生問題的。嗣后，根據一九一八年『勃雷斯脫·立吐美司克條約』的規定，此項領土重黝土耳其，但直至一九二一年才把現在的疆界最後　定。其間，協約　仗着她們對於海峽的　制　，並用使企圖獨立的喬治亞·愛里文·亞塞拜然各省，在蘇土之間構成一條Ｏordon　Sanitaire（防止傳染病的封鎖綫），終於成了上面說過的蘇土復交。外高加索對於西方各國似乎是一處遼遠的地方，不值得她們在大戰結束後，再在那兒徒耗人力和物力，因此，　紥在那兒的英國軍隊便於一九一九年八月撤退了。同時，外高加索共和國的內部又未能統一。於是，就</p>
<p>給蘇聯以可乘之機</p>
<p>。亞塞拜然於一九二〇年初便宣佈爲蘇維埃共和國。愛里文的亞美尼亞共和國，受到了騵土兩國的攻擊，不得不於十一月七日要求停戰，接着，在十二月中，就成立了一個蘇維埃政府·土耳其曾在戰爭時期佔喀斯（亞美尼亞要塞），要求把一九一四年大戰前在俄國邊疆的該區領土約四分之三割讓給土耳其，但此項要求未獲接受。</p>
<p>喬治亞，保持着堅强的民族獨立的傳統，在她的鄰邦屈膝之後，仍舊繼續抵抗蘇土兩國的攻擊，但至一九二一年，在强有力的蘇聯壓力之下，喬治亞蘇維埃共和國絡於宣吿成立了，王耳其的軍國應之而撤退。在這一混亂時期中，外高加索的領土時時易手，最後始於一九二一年三月在莫科獲得解決，蘇土簽訂條約，規定巴統和在黑海一端的『巴統——巴庫輸油管』應屬於蘇聯，但土耳其得無限制地使用該處港口，喀斯和阿達漢則應歸還給土耳其</p>
<p>關於這一時期的外高加索局勢，我們必須提及亞美尼亞的獨立企圖，此種企圖協約國在大戰時以及和平會議開會時，均曾予以鼓勵。成爾遜總統於一九一八年一月八日發表其著名的『十二點』演說，其中曾包含有下列聲明：『……目前在土耳其統治下的其他民族應保證其　庸疑問的生命安全，和絕對不容滋擾的發展自治的機會……』一九二〇年四月，以亞美尼亞委託美國代管，美國拒絕接受。土耳其和協約國簽訂的『塞佛爾條約』因未經批准而失效，依照此項條約，土耳其應承認亞美尼亞爲一個自由獨立的國家，其疆界應依照一九二〇年十一月威爾遜總統的裁定而劃定。協約國並未履行她們對於亞美尼亞的諾言。因之，僑寓倫教的一羣亞美尼亞人便以此爲藉口，自稱亞美尼亞社會主義黨，於一九四五年十月致書倫教外長會議，宣稱：『全世界亞美尼亞人絕對一致，要求執行威爾遜總統的裁定，他們堅定地　望，倘蘇聯要求將</p>
<p>土屬亞美尼亞各省</p>
<p>劃人蘇維埃亞美尼亞界綫內時，英美政府應與蘇聯政府採取一致行動。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯領土要求之人種學的根據，土耳其所持的兌解，以爲廣義地說起來，此項根據，如今是已經不存在的了。此種見解獲得公正的觀察家所提供的證據予以支援。同時，蘇聯以前從未根據人種學的理由，要求過喀斯和阿達漢的領土，而且蘇維埃亞美尼亞的八口，依其相對密度而論，也未見得過份擁擠，這兩件事實也是値得我們在這兒一提的。</p>
<p>由此觀之，蘇聯對於外高加索的領土要求祗是黑海海峽問題的一種副產品，已有歷史事實爲之證明。同時，最近在伊朋所屬亞塞拜然省內所發生的事態，則更使時局嚴重化，不僅影響到土耳其，連整個中東的前途都受到影響了。（張德乾譯）</p>

<h3>讀者意見　苛雜攤派盛行　浙東人民不堪負荷</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>八年抗戰，一旦勝利，政府在復員倥惚之際，對於民衆所迫切要求之生活安定與生活增進實爲急務，絕不能視作緩圖，故自勝利消息傳播後，政府所給予民衆之第一德音，即爲豁免全國收復區三十四年度之田賦，誠以八年黑暗，民衆受敵僞壓迫，挨度牛馬生活，一旦河山重光，政府便下令豁免田賦，使民衆稍得蘇息，眞不啻恩深雨露！孰意中樞美政，適得其反，政出多門，捐無定額，不帶征於田賦，（因卅四年度田賦豁免，無從帶征），不統籌於政府，（因捐款多於牛毛，急如星火，省府縣府似均不及統計，無從統籌），乃假手易滋弊混之鄕鎭保甲，挨胡征募，無一倖免，今且變本加厲，迄不加以制限。未經實地考察者，或疑爲過甚其詞，今試就不佞最近以奔父喪，回返十年別離之浙省故鄕——餘姚，作一例證。</p>
<p>據鄕父老言：去年八九月間，勝利消息傳遍於浙省全境，吾餘姚就向全縣民衆，捐募「慶祝抗戰勝利大會費」，（勝利後第一種捐）。此時民衆驟覩大日，羣情歡洽，簟壺爭迎，巨款立集，原無待於攤募。然其後除營業稅，屠宰稅……等等正稅外，瑣雜苛捐，如潮汹湧，接踵而至，截至目前，據鄕民記憶所及，在短短六個月之間，已有十二種捐款之多，大要如下：（一）軍民合作社徴用民伕費，（二）駐防軍隊供應費，（三）購置槍械費，（四）聯絡情報網費，（五）軍糧，（六）公糧，（七）縣自衛隊副食服裝費，（八）區行政機關設備費，（九）國民學校經常費，（十）鄕村房警捐費，（十一）農會經費，（十二）中正堂築建費。諸如此類苛捐，疊床架屋，層出不窮，每次徵收，非省令縣，即縣令鄕，鄕以令保，保以令甲，甲則沿門挨戶，分向業佃雙方征米征幣，多寡唯命，漫無標準。而不肖保甲，巧取中飽，勢所難免，就個中佔計，政府之正收入一，而民衆之繳納者將一以倍之，甚且倍上加倍，其擔負之重，不堪設想。以是民衆終日皇皇然唯恐保甲長手中之公文，自衛隊腰間之木壳，（微收時多派武裝自衛隊），赫然降臨於柴門之前，而爲之肉跳心驚，欲哭無淚。政府平時徵收田賦，一年不過一期或兩期，而此等徵募，苛雜不堪，營營無已，擾擾不絕，人言「苛政猛於虎」，其實竭澤而漁，比虎更猛，人言「雜徵擾於蠅」，其實朝令夕至，比蠅更擾。是則政府虛施「豁免田賦」之德音，而民衆實受「羅掘俱窮」之苛政，民衆不死於虎，不死於匪，不死於敵，不死於僞，而死於領導抗戰成功之政府，其爲怨憤，孰甚於此！</p>
<p>抑尤不可解者，我主席堅苦卓絕，領導抗戰，歷八年如一日，其不可磨滅之功績，彪炳中外，永垂千載，民衆思所以紀念之者，何嘗不人同此心！今浙省當局，爲主席建築一「中正堂」，以資紀念，此正民衆在昇平盛世，所願「經之營之不日成立」者。然當此瘡痍滿目，人民奄奄欲絕之際，而我餘姚一縣，竟勒派「中正堂建築費」至三百萬元之鉅，縣長無法籌措，則責令鄕長，鄉長無法籌措，則責令保甲長，保甲長遂又沿門挨戶，强制攤徵，擾擾一如其他苛捐之瑣雜。民衆以此堂乃紀念主席之偉大功績，即無力應命，亦必典質假貸，忍餓耐寒以應之，獨不知浙省當局，何以不仰體主席「視民如傷」之心，而顧全此極有歷史價値之堂構，建築於民衆呻吟之上？吾知偉大之主席，必不忍聞而樂受，而我浙省當局亦常知所以廢然返矣。</p>
<p>以上云云，皆有客觀事實爲證，絕無一點感情作用，深望政府當局，鑒我民衆痛苦，不可再增，毅然停微種種苛捐，勿重擾吾民。據鄕父老多數意見，寗願忍痛一時，提前繳納三十五年度田賦，（三十五年度田賦，按例須本年九月間，始可開徵），所有雜捐，一併隨田賦帶徵，由縣府統徵統解，統收統交，勿再假手保甲，徽募分文，旣杜混弊，又免騷擾，使小民在重負之下，猶得寗處；不然，影響所及，非僅一家一路之哭，賞足粉碎勝利之果，而置國家於萬刦不復之境。心所調危，未敢緘默，因思貴報持論公正，爲民衆喉舌，乞借一角餘地，予以發表，並煩代向政府呼籲，迅籌整個補救方案，此所以解民倒懸，亦所以出民水火，爲民請命，五體投地，尙其鑒諸。（張薏居，三月十一日）</p>
<h3>請財政當局　闡明國家公債政策</h3>
<p>主筆先生：鄙人素屬信仰公債，並爲公債業中之一小卒，茲因公債業同人等對於公債當前情形殊感苦悶，抑且甚多質疑，亟需財政當軸予以解釋，藉釋衆惑。茲以貴報素爲民衆喉舌，鄙人大胆，以小民之資格，敢請貴報予以發表，藉獲各界賢明之指點並得當軸之明示。茲列下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）公債因戰事影響，通貨膨脹，幣値之貶落，其票面之價値已屬不及當初發行時之千分之一，按其目前市價則又復超出其票面的十五倍，財政當局何竟視若無睹，且一昨二中全曾兪財長對金融財政所作報吿中竟對公債一字不提。豈公債係無關重要之事項乎？</p>
<p>（二）救國公債現時之市價略貴統丙公債，自國府因戰事西遷後，此債即如無價證券，而今勝利來臨，祗聞美金英鎊公債中籤遷本付息，而對此救國之公債竟音訊全無。豈因其按照目前票面價値忽而略小之過乎？然常初因愛國而購債所付之法幣其價値迥異乎目前。試問世上各國豈有購救國公債者，於其國家勝利後反收獲若是之美果否？</p>
<p>（三）公債行市因財政當軸之無表示亦不付本息，更引起大衆信仰政府必維護債信，自不致使債券持有人有任何損失，因之市價略高，統丙公債最高曾至其票面二十四倍，較之物資股票烚赤殊覺其可憐已極，然各界輿論竟連連指斥，引爲投機豈若輩中竟無一正義感者乎？試問同一國家發行之公債，以外幣爲本位者可無損失，而以本國通貨爲本位者理應招殃，則此後孰得而信仰或投資於以本國通貨爲本位之債券？</p>
<p>（四）以上連帶得一問題，即政府袞袞諸公，日夜籌商收縮通貨，何竟忘却驅使資金轉入於投資公債？豈國家對發行新公債有所顧忌乎？</p>
<p>（五）公債係屬有價證券，且明文規定得自由買賣何以近日警局得任意拘捕公債經營者或阻碍其交易自由。上週同業李君，曾爲拘至警局，扣留達三數小時，後須留一手印，方獲得釋。豈公債條例規定自由買賣已屬取消無效？然亦未見有財政當軸有何明文頒佈取消。特此敢問？「此究屬賣什麼關子」？</p>
<p>（六）據該李君言，彼業此已達拾餘年，終其生甚信仰國家，在敵僞時代亦曾因經營公債爲所拘禁，初未料日月重光後，竟復重見此境。心憤之餘，甚悔當初不爲購金儲外匯囤貨之流，今日反得志滿意得。此「李君之新結論」問題表面視若無關宏旨，然實際堪慮。試問明見者需否或如何抱救此種變態之心理？</p>
<p>上列各項雖云甚爲平淡，然處於全國金融中心之上海，則不可不提，蓋其影響非小。尙祈各界賢達並及賢明當軸速於敎導。施家浩（三月五日）</p>
<h3>潼洛道上苦刑記</h3>
<p>— 范鴻寄</p>
<p>本報洛陽廿三日訊</p>
<p>在潼關住了兩三天，因爲種種的困難，幾乎改變了沿隴海路東行的計劃，曾一度與晋察綏濟分署商好，同該署大批工作人員至太原，再設法轉至北平，但以諸多友人託辦事件不得不想法做到，且家鄕闊別多年，雙親久在盼望，又不能不趁比一省，適逢聯運處周處長赴潼關視察，才解決了東來的困難。於廿一日晨，就搭上隴海聯運車，離開了潼關。</p>
<p>車子一開，灰塵騰空而起。坐在車子尾巴上，向後面一瞧，那騰起的灰土，好像夏天的捲雲，更像那瀑布冲打在石頭上的浪花，波浪汹湧，奔騰澎湃，若無塵土之衝鼻而入，眞不知是置身在黃土高原之上。</p>
<p>走了沒多遠，一個轉灣，一個陡坡，車子加足馬力，也開不上去，結果是後面的人下來推。</p>
<p>出第一關　踏上了生死線</p>
<p>出了第一關（豫秦交界），便俯瞰到由山洞出來的鐵路，這地方是戰時最受敵人威脅的一段，不知吃過多少敵人的砲彈，多少車頭和乘客都在這裏喪命。我們走的這條土路，是前淸火車沒通前的馬車老道，路面完全是馬車拉成的。抗戰後，陝豫路斷，這路就成了兩省來往的唯一要道，我眞料不到所謂復員車輛會走這條狹窄曲折陡斜的土路，而不是原來的洛潼公路。更商怪的，路上一點也不加修整。舖石子和修建橋樑，固然來不及，把路面不整齊或陡斜陡轉太甚的加以人工注意，似乎並不是太困難的事。這樣不管車子的壽命，不顧復員旅客的安全，不問乘客的健康，賞在令人傷心。凡是看到這條路的人，誰都搖頭嘆氣：「太不行了！」聽說一下雨，路上走十天八天還不定，所以有的人乾脆多化幾天路程，坐「啦啦車」，此較危險還小一點。</p>
<p>覆車悲劇　遍地皆是行李</p>
<p>當我們車子走到某地的時候，和我們前後走的一輛車，倒翻在路旁，很多的乘客頭破血流，坐的，躺的，呌喊的，都有，行李掉得滿地都是。翻章的原因，是：路太窄，路邊太虛。遇到對面章早子一來，一讓車，便滑到在田裏，我們的車子在下轉灣，也開到田邊，幸而司機靈敏，立刻停車，呼乘客下車，趕忙把車拖拉了上去，否則不有致命傷，也多少要流血。</p>
<p>我們還想不到的坐車痛苦，是一輛車不論大小，硬要坐三十多個人。行李滿車，大人孩子近四十個，爲了交通工具不够，這登記的一車三十個非坐下不行。結果，只有拚命的擠，擠得只要有站脚地點就算。車站把這一羣乘客都送上車。</p>
<p>風雲緊張　嘗透擠的苦味</p>
<p>那擠的情形，不亞於前年湘桂火車上的逃難。坐在邊上的，走在顚波不已的曲折傾斜大道上，惟恐被摔在車下，不能不儘量向內擠，以保持其生命的安全，坐在裏國的，脚上固然是人躍人身，身上肩上，也要負載很多的拖拉依靠等等重量。上部有負担，下部不能動，屁股坐不到位子上，車子的移動，兩手無法來支持自己的身體。但這個被擠壓拖拉的罪，是要一分一刻的忍受過去，所以整個車上沒有一分鐘是寗靜的，不是這裏吵着腿伸不出來，就是那裏嚷着左右人侵佔了他的地方，擠倒了她的小孩，風雲緊張，如火如茶。我也嘗了內外前後的滋味，是從來所沒有的，所以我說：「潼洛道上，受盡苦刑！」</p>
<p>到了中午以後，太陽直射到地上，灰土飛揚得更厲害。人們的呼吸，促迫到了極點。中午的飯大部是不想吃，發熱發燥，什麼也吃不下。到了下午，身子完全鍍上了一層黃土，約有二三個銅板厚。鼻子，嘴，眼睛，耳朶，都被黃土封閉了，完全成了一個「土人」。</p>
<p>車抵陜州　情形益形紊亂</p>
<p>一路的檢查很少，檢查哨有兩三個，只是車子一停，一登記就放過，再沒有其他的麻煩。第一天晚上，到了陝州，去潼關一百一十一公里，下車上車，站上是完全不管的，行李由自己取，自己放，自己保管。坐車也不再排號，由自己找位置，比以前的情形更亂。</p>
<p>陝州的東西和潼蘭差不多，旅館每日三百六十元，茶水八十元，小費隨意。飯每餐的五百元上下。旅館還是家家「客滿」，所以車一到站，客人找旅館是一件大事，決不像戰前很多旅館派人到車站爭着接客。</p>
<p>陝州到洛陽共一百五十公里，汽車很多，每晚司機們就挨旅館，找老闆去問：「有沒有上洛陽的好車子？」在溢種情形下，車子找人，客人可以佔便宜，這就是說：可以還價，普通數千元就可成交。</p>
<p>爛路破車　如何有裨復員</p>
<p>第二日走過張茅，觀音堂，　池，鐵門，新安，物價都比較低，賣者遇車子，過街就呌。</p>
<p>車子路上輪貽放了氣，又等了一個小時。幸巧當晚還算趕到洛陽城，據司機說：他們的車子沒有一輛好的，每開一次要修兩三天，再休息一兩天，每月至多開三次，在這樣緊急的復員中，這短短的二百六十一公里路程，每月只走一千多里，未免太不夠緊張，太令路外人失望了。路為何不修？章爲何不用好的？拿這爛路破車來對付，怎麼能說這就是復員交通？（二月廿三日於洛陽）</p>

<h3>從『嫦娥奔月』說起</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>那還是去年的事。</p>
<p>銀藍色的天空裏，掛着銀白巴的月，正是三五團圓的中秋之夕。</p>
<p>風過處，庭院裏有一陣桂花氣息。</p>
<p>『喔！皓月當空，冰輪乍湧，好一片淸秋光景……』剛學了兩個多月京戲的微　，三句話離不了『本行』。</p>
<p>『一天到晚，鷄貓子喊呌的，可惡也可惡死了。』那是學了八天就『英雄氣短』的睫娜，一　是戲就生氣。</p>
<p>『你懂什麼？』微蘿說：『這叫「觸景生情」呀！』</p>
<p>『你懂什麼？』婕娜這：『找學了三天半也知道這幾句是「霸王別姬」裏頭的，你要觸景生情，幹嗎不唱「嫦娥奔月」？徧哼哼那個？』</p>
<p>『嫦娥奔月』我還沒學哩！』</p>
<p>說得大家全都笑了。</p>
<p>於是話題轉到嫦娥——</p>
<p>磬子凝視着一輸皓月，若有所思的說：『科學家的理論眞煞風景，多美麗的神仙故事！我從小就心嚮往之，那篇動人的仙話「嫦娥奔月」，偏偏那些人要說什麼月球是太陽系的衛星，又是什麼冰川……一大堆的理論，弄得八興味索然。』</p>
<p>多麼詩意的想法！</p>
<p>『科學家罪該萬死，娘娘息怒。』俏皮的微蘿父來「觸景生情」了。</p>
<p>又是一陣笑。</p>
<p>『我也贊成磬子的話，要是早幾千年就有這一套科學理論，找們將讀不到那許多好的詩詞文　，也未可知。』璇珠說。</p>
<p>『可不是嗎？』婕娜笑起來：『照那樣，至少微　就是再學十年戲，怕也學不着「嫦娥奔月」。』</p>
<p>『晤！一嫦娥奔月』沒有倒不打緊，還是用「霸工別姬」代管好了；』微蘿一本正經的：『只是前人的吟咏不大牛都是歌頌自然嗎？十首詩裏提到月亮的，』她又來上一句「四郞探母」的坦白：『倒有個八九。』</p>
<p>『你也說得過火了，』婕娜道：『科學家又沒說天上沒月亮，　着了什麼？』</p>
<p>『這——』微　了她一眼：『怎麼你今兒個專門跟我找麻煩？』她想了想，叫道：『有了，至少有一句詩，李商隱的「嫦娥應悔偸靈藥，』不就寫不成了嗎？』</p>
<p>『提起這首詩，』馨十問：『你們想像中的嫦娥，是個什麼樣人？』</p>
<p>『如王嬙重出世，顏如西子再還魂。』缺德的微蘿，又引出兩句七字段的彈詞出來。</p>
<p>『不對，嫦娥的時候，西子土嬌全還都沒有哪！焉能「重出世」與「再還魂」？』璇珠說：『嫦娥是月的女神，艷如桃李，冷若冰霜。』</p>
<p>『冷若冰霜只是外表的態度，嫦娥是個熱情的女人。』睫娜肯定的說。</p>
<p>『何所謂而云然？』</p>
<p>『否則，她爲什麼要「悔偷靈藥」？又爲什麼要「碧海靑天夜夜心」？』</p>
<p>『其賞，嫦娥也忒痴情了，似后羿那樣的人也値得留戀嗎？女人眞是可憐，述嫦娥都未能例外。』璇珠嘆了口氣，有點弦外之音。</p>
<p>『眞是一羣書獃子，』微蘿笑着，銀鈴子似的：『那不過是詩人的胡說而已，你們全上了李商隱的當啦！試想嫦娥坐在廣寒宮裏，何等逍遙，何等自在，看透了人世界的滄海桑田，驚　鳳泊，悲歡離合均空幻，她還惦記着后羿幹什麼？他還惦記着那個——』</p>
<p>『聽她的，快拿紙筆來，好一篇漂亮的論文？』又是找她麻煩的婕娜，打斷了話。</p>
<p>『沒準兒她還有個孩子留下，她就不惦記着后羿，也要想念她孩子。』細弱的璇珠的聲音，這話沒有被大家全聽見。</p>
<p>『媽味，你們在說什麼？』森森。婕娜的九歲的兒子跑過來，問。</p>
<p>『森森，我們在說月裏嫦娥的故事。』</p>
<p>『月亮襄有吳剛，昨天李老師吿訴我們的，吳剛砍桂。』</p>
<p>『眞的，月裏還有位吳剛先生哩！幸而這孩子一提，』婕娜說：『咱們一直把他給忘了。』</p>
<p>『如此說來，嫦娥也有了同伴，更不會「碧海靑犬夜夜心」了。』微蘿大笑起來。</p>
<p>『幹什麼今天你沒有一句話，沒有一點高見發表呢？』磐子問我。</p>
<p>我笑了笑，沒有答她的話。本來麼，我對於婦女問題這一類大事情，向來弄不淸楚，她們竟將嫦娥奔月像娜拉出走一樣的討論，我還有什麼可說呢？</p>
<p>一九四六·三·八</p>
<h3>老人</h3>
<p>— 蕭羣</p>
<p>我的六伯父所處的境地是相當淒慘的，他活着是個累贅，他早年曾經煊赫過一陣，然而此是過去的事，現在沒有人再注意到他，親戚朋友們都想法遠遠避開他，人家嫌他嚕　，嫌他的話不合時宜，即使他的老婆，他的媳婦以及他的孫子們都可以任意作踐他，好像他的存在實在多餘似地。</p>
<p>然而讓我來說，六伯父實在是好心腸的老人，他爲人厚道忠誠，待人如待已，對於子姪可以設無分軒輊，往年他同我的父親情感似膠似漆，他們要好的程度實在令人難以想像，同起居，同飲食，我的父親故世的時候，他着實悲傷了一陣，從前他還可以有個人聊天談閒，而現在他的老伴也遠遠離開他走了。</p>
<p>我的六伯父論年耙已經七十開外，但看樣子還不十分萎　，自然一般老人之龍鍾老態總是免不了的，他身體很健康，長年難得有點小毛病，他平時慣操作，像掃掃蜘蛛網以及弄弄花草什麼的，似乎不這樣他的日子就無法排遣，人家說或許他這樣勞動對身體是很有助益的，有過一回，突然他半夜要瀉起來，而几瀉得很利害，總要二三十次，家裏人着實吓了一陣，但第二天他完全好好地，照舊掃蜘蛛網，照舊弄弄花草，似乎壓把兒就什麼也沒發生過。</p>
<p>我的六伯父很早就離開故鄕，年幼時境遇是相當窮困的一直到現在，他仍喜歡絮絮不休叙述當年拮据的情形，像在南京趕考，賣掉皮裘度歲一類的事，他很喜歡談那個，他覺得這是給子孫最好的敎訓，目前我們的家所以有這副境地，亡伯父的創績是不可抹煞的，他從前幹過很多事，做過師範學堂敎習，做過報館主筆，也當過工廠廠長，四十歲以後他患了一次很重的病，差一點離開人世，後來雖然病好了，但腦筋却糊塗起來，隔日的事他都記不清楚，甚至於家裏的親戚隔些日子不走動他也會不認識起來，爲此時常閙點笑話，但得病前的事他却記得很淸楚。就連古書的字句他也可以整段背誦，有人說這是他的福氣，他也自己誇耀入於半仙之境，他說他吃飯睡覺都超神入化，可吃可不吃，整大不吃東西也不感覺飢餓，他最愛鄭板橋一句話，難得糊塗，他說古今中外入於他這種境界是很少有的。</p>
<p>因爲糊塗，所以多少年來他一直過着息影生活，他手創的事業讓姪輩們辦得一踏糊塗，偶而人吿訴他一些，他氣得很利害，他對姪輩們種種卑劣手段是不大敢置信的。但隨後他又忘記得乾乾凈凈，頂可笑的，這幾年我們家的景况已經逐漸中落，往日的舊佣人都已星散，但他有時仍舊歡喜大聲喚叫，別人都嘻嘻好笑，他歡喜來點小麻將，但人們大都不顯陪他，預多幾個孫女有時高起興來陪他义個四圈，他爲了一張牌也有時像小孩似地掙得頻頻痛紅，這幾年物價的變動，他完全無動於中，日木人來了又去了，他也完全不曉得，在他的記憶襄，以爲日子還像從前那麼好過，像米賣十塊錢一担，那麼便宜，有一次人們吿訴他鷄蛋已經賣到一萬了，他的驚訝是不可言喻的，他說他決心不再吃，自然那也不過說說而已，隔上十分鐘，他已經忘記自己曾經說過點什麼了。</p>
<h3>更聲</h3>
<p>— 索伊</p>
<p>朋友，你花這喧囂的都市裏，也聽到這更聲嗎？</p>
<p>子夜，寂靜的黝黯裏；朋友，你聽那窗外，正有着一陣陣單調而凄凉的更聲，從長巷口幽幽地傳播出來。</p>
<p>如果你探出身子，你便可看見在冷艷的日光下，映現着一片瘦瘦的陰影，手執着一盞風燈，機械式地敲着竹析，由遠而近了</p>
<p>在這黑森森的世界裏，沒有一個人倍伴着他，度過這漫長的黑夜。所最親切的便是這一盞風燈了。在單調的更聲中，就這樣走遍了大街小巷，完畢他這一天的責任。</p>
<p>那更聲，像是古剎裏的修道士，在撞着鐘，發出那種凄凄的音波，濯淸你那久已混濁了的心胸。</p>
<h3>黃山紀遊詩卷</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>皖南王簡芳逸梅女士，爲二十年前同學，不相見，已十有五年矣！事變前，書疏往返，未嘗中斷，二十五年春，敎育部在京舉行第二次全國美展，曾有拙作參加，余與逸梅雖皆到京參觀，以行期相左，未及把晤。來書謂：大作山水一幀，淸雅可喜云：余感爲知言，遂以奉敎。旋即報我手製「黃山紀遊詩卷」一幀長二尺許，高六寸，白色綾緞，　藍色詩書，精美絕倫，詩書繡，可稱三絕。詩日：「一角危樓嶺上閑，西窗向晚不須關；好從雲樹蒼茫外，指點斜陽下遠山。」雋永不凡，書法亦娟秀蒼動，不類巾幗手筆，什襲而藏，倐已十易寒暑，每念伊人，天各一方，展卷怦然，不能自已；乃追和兩絕：</p>
<p>漫遊勝景意　閑，雲物層樓未</p>
<p>許關；字字珠璣君手製，對君</p>
<p>几席烟雲長日閑，半空天籟豈</p>
<p>能關？貽吾錦繡詩書卷，渾似</p>
<p>飛來一片山。</p>
<h3>別海牙</h3>
<p>— 金問泗</p>
<p>籠軗連轉拂曉行，鋒車欲發不勝情；圓催水國風輪轉，綠憶江鄕稻色明。七載終成秦逐客，丁年尙媿漢蘇鄕；時危最喜高堂健，滬瀆巴城念弟兄。</p>
<h3>離比京答和前韻</h3>
<p>— 錢泰</p>
<p>關史獰威禁客行，流亡塞道黍離情；飢腸轆轉迎風冷，夜警頻傳怕月明。兩地同悉懷摯友，幾番避難累荆卿；歸途萬里征槎阻，且將平安報弟兄。</p>
<h3>離波蘭走比法答和前韻</h3>
<p>— 王景岐（已故）</p>
<p>家山殘破路難行，千萬逃亡一苦情；（義戰春秋書未見，危棋楚漢局誰明。黃沙碧而悲前轍，黑夜　車走客　；慘是無功有枯骨，父哀其子弟其兄。</p>
<h3>出巴黎答和前韻</h3>
<p>— 施肇䕫</p>
<p>百折迂廻黑夜行，流亡滿地不堪情；風吹征轂疑問警，月映荒郊色半明。八載垂槎方覺夢，萬方多難倍思卿；還期指日銷兵革，四海人皆是弟兄。</p>
<h3>用舍弟別海牙韻並懷旅歐諸友</h3>
<p>— 金問洙</p>
<p>軒轆轆四方行，不盡纏綿故國情，風雨幾疑成混沌，河山猶是照晴明。滔天浪亂爭盟主，寄跡秋愁賦客卿；荼苦薺甘共傾吐，遙知相憶亦相兄。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（十九）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>幾個月以前，維新大舞台從漢口邀來一批名優演唱京劇，於是瘋狂了全荆州有閒階級的男男女女，瘋在了翁二太太和墨太太。翁二太太簡直迷上了那個唱花衫的石玉棋，墨太太却只是迷上了戲。翁二太太差不多固定了一個包廂，每天都偕同墨太太去捧塲，除非是這天沒有石玉樓的戲</p>
<p>翁二太太爲了自己的嗜好，本來也會唱幾句，所以就特別喜歡京戲。起初，翁二太太不過很佩服舞台上石玉樓的演技，後來竟愛了舞台下的石玉樓其人。起初她只是天天去聽戲，後來，翁二太太居然送彩綢給石玉樓扑塲。就在送彩綢的這一天，翁二太太和石玉樓正式認識了。他們雖是匆匆會面——石玉樓收到了彩綢，在登台之前，由戲院經理領着，悄悄走到翁二太太的包廂去道謝，經理介紹以後，他微笑地向翁二太太行了個半鞠躬禮便退下了。而這微微的一笑，更深陶醉了翁二太太的心，她的魂兒就被這微微的一笑勾走了！這一天石玉樓唱的是「醉酒」，她日不轉睛的釘住石玉樓，這時她忽然神經過敏地發現石玉樓向她「飛眼兒」了，她樂得立刻抓住墨太太叫起來！驚動得四週看客都紛紛向她注視。第二天她便在館子裏請石玉樓吃飯，墨太太和純理作陪。這一次她滿足了，她得坐在石玉樓的身旁；她得與石玉樓談話；她得盡量地多看石玉棋幾眼，而且她覺得這時候是她一個人——至多兩個人——佔有了石玉樓；不像在戲院裏，有許多人看石玉樓，甚而愛石玉樓。石玉樓始終不大多講話，只常常微笑着，翁二太太便爲這微笑所俘擄！從此，翁二太太漸漸和石玉樓混熟了，她不但經常去聽他的戲；請他吃館子，而且也約他到家裏幽會。橫豎翁老爺白天總是在夢鄕裏。</p>
<p>石玉樓上裝的扮相，確是漂亮，本人生得也很淸秀。年紀不過三十歲，身體可瘦弱得厲害。也許是他受了戲的影響太深，一舉一動都像女人，溫柔，斯文，說話從不曾高聲過。翁二太太在墨太太的面前，是十足的女人；在石玉樓的面前，倒變成了十足的男子。石玉樓算得是一位當代的名優，唱工作工，都在水準以上。因此捧的人相當多，即令男人，也有不少着迷的。他的一切都使翁二太太滿意，只這一點爲石玉樓引起的嫉妒，使她痛苦！</p>
<p>還有，就是石玉樓也染有和翁老爺同一嗜好的鴉片烟癮，道可讓翁二太太爲難不輕！她從心裏討厭這玩意兒，但她不能勸石玉樓戒掉，因爲石玉樓近幾年全靠鴉片提精神，沒有道個，他根木唱不出來。因此翁二太太不僅阻止不了，甚而爲了取得他的歡心，常常偷了翁老爺熬好的純淨烟膏子贈送石玉樓。白玉樓之願意到翁家去。也是爲這個緣故。翁二太太可以乘翁老爺睡覺的時間，把烟傢伙偸着拿給石玉樓過應。翁二太太原已受翁老爺的訓練，所以很會燒烟侍候石玉樓。</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops in Shenyang Entirely Reassigned; We Have Gradually Controlled the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 11th] Shenyang, 11th: On the fifth day of the Soviet troop withdrawal, the city of Shenyang is generally still stable.

<h3>Process of Resolving the Yining Incident; Minister Zhang Reports at the Second Plenary Session; Emphasizing Improving Politics to Stabilize Xinjiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] The fifteenth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held at 10:30 AM on the 12th, after the memorial service for the death of Sun Yat-sen. 288 members attended. Zou Lu presided over the meeting, and Zhang Zhizhong made a report on the plan to resolve the Xinjiang issue, which lasted for one hour and thirty minutes. The chairman then reported on the review of the report on border issues, and committee member 麥斯武德 made comments before the meeting adjourned. Zhang's report first mentioned the Yining incident in Xinjiang, which occurred in July 1944 and gradually expanded until July of last year. He was instructed by the central government to go to Dihua twice in September and October of last year, accompanied by Liang Hancao, Deng Wenyi, and others. The Yining people's representatives 拉合木臣, 阿不都哈依爾吐烈, and 阿合買提 also came to Dihua to discuss. He then detailed the negotiations and the terms agreed upon by both sides to resolve the armed conflict peacefully. Regarding diplomacy, he emphasized that from the perspective of the entire country, especially from the perspective of resolving the Xinjiang issue, it is necessary to seek friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union with the utmost sincerity. Secondly, he discussed his opinions on governing Xinjiang, arguing that: (1) Except for national defense, diplomacy, currency, transportation, and judiciary, which should be handled by the central government, local autonomy, ethnic culture, and economic construction should be fully developed locally. (2) The importance of Xinjiang Province to the country should not be ignored. (3) One should not "nickel and dime" from a financial point of view. Regarding the railway from Xinjiang to Lanzhou, it should not be postponed indefinitely because the project is huge, the road is desolate, and it cannot be profitable. He also called on the General Assembly to pay great attention to Northwest transportation and quickly open up railways. His conclusion was: First, use the power of the Three Principles of the People to protect Xinjiang; second, use improved politics to stabilize Xinjiang; and third, use sufficient economic power to build Xinjiang. Zhang's report greatly moved the entire audience, and applause continued. Subsequently, the chairman announced the start of the review. Committee member 麥斯武德 from Xinjiang spoke, briefly stating: The people of Xinjiang need the country, and they also need their homes and houses. Xinjiang is the door to China, and the people of Xinjiang have been guarding this door for thousands of years, fulfilling their responsibilities. At the same time, they also hope that compatriots in the interior can consider the needs of the border people. I am willing to do my best to promote the connection between the border people and the central government. Finally, I would like to represent the border people and those who love Xinjiang: pay tribute to Minister Zhang. Editor's Note: The process of the Yining incident was detailed by this newspaper on the third page of February 9th and 10th, titled "An Outline of the Situation in Xinjiang" and "Prospects for a New Zhang," which can be used for reference.</p>
<h3>"Wang Mansion" Interior Scene</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Nanjing, Shen Shi</p>
<p>Record of Talks with the Children of Traitors (Part 1)</p>
<p>Traitor Chen Bijun Willing to "Die"</p>
<p>Since the victory, no Nanjing news reporter has been allowed to see any of the captured traitors. Since the deportation of traitor Chen Gongbo, traitor Chen Bijun, and traitor Chu Minyi to Suzhou, the traitor concentration camp at No. 25 Ninghai Road here has lost the object of capturing the ringleader first, and everyone has stopped trying to find a way in.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, this reporter received a phone call, which turned out to be an invitation from the Nanjing office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, inviting us reporters to visit the handover of the property of Wang Mengjin, son of the traitor Wang Jingwei, and to visit the Nanjing residences of the traitors Wang and Chu. Unexpectedly, there was an unexpected harvest. Early in the morning, I rushed to No. 4 Chibi Road, where I was greeted by Wang Wenxun, the third daughter of traitor Wang Jingwei. During the conversation, I saw the following letter from traitor Chen Bijun in prison:</p>
<p>To the High Court, I will definitely not hire a lawyer. If I am sentenced to death, I will not appeal, in order to show that I am not afraid of death and that I am doing a peace movement for everything. All other slanders will be clarified without argument. I only hope that all comrades in the peace movement and those who have been affected by the peace movement will be released as soon as possible, otherwise the country will sacrifice too much. The government often pays attention to their individual cases and also often thinks of their families, because their families outside are actually more suffering than those who are detained. In the midst of sadness and poverty, the elderly turn to the ravines, and the young are forced into detours, which must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>"As for myself, I can afford to die, but I cannot afford to be imprisoned. Therefore, various diseases have occurred one after another in the past two years, and I have been fighting against the disease every day for six months. The cost of medicine is too high to be imprisoned for a long time. If I am not sentenced to death, then whether to appeal depends on the length of the prison sentence. It is best to die once and for all. The anger of the outside world is also vented, and comrades may be released because Chen Bijun's death has vented their anger. But no matter what, there is no need to support my family and my children. My personal and public wishes have been fulfilled, so I will not appeal after death."</p>
<p>The above words were written on an old sheet of rough-edged paper. The handwriting is scribbled, the ink is very light, and there are many strokes. According to Wang's daughter, this is a handwritten note that she obtained when she visited traitor Chen Bijun in Suzhou recently. Although she did not get to meet her, she regarded it as a treasure and was unwilling to show it to others. After repeated requests from reporters, Wang's son Mengjin's wife took it out of her handbag. After reading it, we felt that although it was full of high-sounding rhetoric, it was still valuable news material. Finally, we asked Wenxun whether she would follow her mother's orders. Wang's daughter said tactfully, "As children, we must consider the situation at that time before making a decision."</p>
<p>Wang Wenxun Selling Pillowcases?</p>
<p>No. 4 Chibi Road is one of the ordinary upper-class houses in the Nanjing residential area. It is said that this is a temporary rental after Wang's family was driven out of their residence at No. 34 Yihe Road. The furnishings in the house are very messy, but the messiness still does not lose a sense of wealth. Wang's family, except for Wang Jingwei himself who is dead and Chen Bijun who is imprisoned in Suzhou, are all imprisoned at No. 25 Xianhai Road: the eldest son Mengjin, the second son Wendi, the eldest daughter Wenxing, the eldest son-in-law He Wenjie, and a one- or two-year-old grandson. Currently, the only family members living with Wang's daughter are Mengjin's wife Tan Wensu and her two daughters, as well as Chu Minyi's eldest daughter Mengyuan and two so-called "classmates," accompanying them in their loneliness. Tan Wensu is a typical Cantonese woman, short, shy, and unable to speak Mandarin. Chu Mengyuan is rough, full of rural vulgarity, and deeply inherited from her father and mother. Therefore, our conversation partner naturally fell to Wenxun, the daughter of in the above.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Wang Wenxun, according to the impression we got after talking to her for 20 minutes, we feel that she is indeed worthy of being the daughter of in the above. 23 years old, graceful, graduated from the Education College of the Pseudo-Guangzhou University, independently ran a work-study society in Guangzhou, and went to Japan for medical treatment. She was also at the bedside when in the above died. She speaks fluent Beijing dialect, is eloquent, and speaks like a waterfall. At first, she answered the reporters' questions, but later she seemed to be giving a speech, greatly elaborating on her "late father"'s "peace movement." The conclusion is, "Chinese history likes to judge heroes by success or failure, but I always think that my late father was a failed patriot." In the meantime, a wave of her hand, a bend of her waist, countless gestures. According to senior colleagues familiar with Wang in the above, she is simply a living Wang Jingwei, but she resolutely refused to be photographed, saying that she had never been photographed. According to her, since the victory, she has almost searched every military and political leader who came to Nanjing for the destruction of her father's tomb, and also wrote the same five long letters every day, presenting them to Chairman Chiang by various means, with the aim of recovering the bones of Wang in the above. It is said that since Wang's tomb was destroyed on November 22 last year, the whereabouts of the dead bones have not been found. What is said is done, truly such a woman. For example, when the reporters said they wanted to see the Wang in the above spirit hall that her family enshrined, she made things difficult for us for a long time because of the so-called "due courtesy" issue.</p>
<h3>Second Plenary Session Commemorates Sun Yat-sen's Death; President Chiang's Personal Address; Encouraging Peaceful Struggle to Build a New China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] The Second Plenary Session held a memorial service for the death of Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM today. President Chiang presided over the ceremony. After performing the rituals, he delivered a speech on the spot, first putting forward Sun Yat-sen's last teaching of peaceful struggle to save China when he died, believing that our current task of saving the country and building the country must take this last teaching as the center of our efforts. In other words, we must use peaceful methods to achieve our goal of struggle. On the one hand, we must be broad-minded, tolerant, sincere, and trustworthy. On the other hand, we must firmly believe in our revolution and nation-building. On the one hand, we must recognize the times and the environment, serve the people earnestly, and alleviate the suffering of the masses, so that the masses can recognize our sincerity in struggling for the country, and we can quickly unite as one to jointly work hard to solve the national crisis and complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, so as not to fail the painstaking efforts of Sun Yat-sen's repeated teachings.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The heads of various institutions in Nanjing visited Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 8:00 AM on the 21st anniversary of his death. Chief of Staff Yi Su presided over the ceremony on behalf of the Army Headquarters. After all the participants performed the ceremony, they circled the coffin once and retreated. Citizens freely visiting Sun Yat-sen's remains were extremely enthusiastic. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Nanjing held a commemorative meeting for the Tree Planting Festival at the Dahua Theater in the morning. Secretary-General Chen Zuping of the Municipal Government announced at the meeting that the Municipal Government will formulate a ten-year afforestation plan, hoping that Nanjing will become a city with lush forests in ten years. After the meeting, the representatives went to Qingliang Mountain in the drizzle to plant trees. The Municipal Government plans to build a mountain forest park there, partly to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance and partly to commemorate the first anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death after the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, went to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 10:00 AM on the 12th to pay his respects and presented a wreath on behalf of all U.S. military personnel in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 12th] General Lokey, commander of the U.S. Third Amphibious Force, entertained reporters here today on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, comparing Sun Yat-sen to U.S. President George Washington and saying: "On this anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, the American people truly share your hope that a unified China will become the result of your efforts." Today's commemoration should also remind you of the important responsibilities ahead. I, along with all the personnel of the command, wish to commemorate with you and wish you success.</p>
<h3>President Song's Report</h3>
<p>(Continued from part four, conclusion)</p>
<p>Full Efforts to Restore Transportation, Materials to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Third, the response strategy is to restore transportation as quickly as possible. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government placed the highest priority on restoring transportation. However, due to the presence of anti-government forces in various parts of the country, focused efforts were made to destroy railways and coal mines. Important railway lines north of the Yangtze River were repaired and destroyed repeatedly. Therefore, trunk lines such as Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai were never fully repaired. Now that the situation has changed, the Ministry of Transportation is working hard on restoration. Steel rails totaling 280,000 tons, four million sleepers, and 300,000 tons of cement have been ordered from abroad and will arrive soon. Regarding these materials, it is not that our country lacks the funds, but that various countries are competing to purchase them for post-war needs. Therefore, despite exerting great efforts, we can only transport them in batches, which is very different from the pre-war situation where supply was readily available as long as funds were available. Regarding ships, the total tonnage of ships along the coast and rivers of our country, including both Chinese and foreign, was 1.5 million tons. After this war, only a little over 100,000 tons remain. Therefore, water transportation is almost zero. After the end of the war, most of the ships owned by various countries are ocean-going vessels, and there are very few vessels for coastal and river navigation. Our country has already purchased them from various countries. The United States has a large number of ships, but because the United States selling surplus ships must be approved by Congress, the procedures take several months. The government has exhausted all means and has purchased and long-term leased a total of more than 370,000 tons of ships, some of which have arrived, and others are still on the way. We are now in the process of contacting and purchasing a large number of ships. At the same time, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is also leasing ships and purchasing landing craft to facilitate water transportation. In the past, Japan relied on the connection between the shipping industry and the textile industry to absorb a large amount of foreign exchange from abroad. Now that Japan has collapsed, our country's ships, in addition to domestic use, should not ignore the great source of wealth in the Nanyang transportation industry. Regarding roads, after eight years of hard fighting, many roads have been severely damaged. They are now being repaired by region. Most of the original trucks in our country are old and dilapidated. The government has now purchased 25,000 trucks, which can be transported in the near future. After that, road transportation can be gradually strengthened. The plan to increase and restore transportation has already been decided. After this, as long as we work hard to implement it, although this kind of work has time limits, we can hope that it will definitely improve day by day.</p>
<p>Opening Up Foreign Trade, Adopting Flexible Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Fourth, the response plan is to open up foreign trade. The official exchange rate set by the government is 20:1 for US dollars. This has been in place for many years. This ratio is completely divorced from the general market, so foreign trade has almost completely stopped. Recently, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the "Measures for Opening Up Foreign Trade" last Monday, and the Executive Yuan announced and implemented it on the same day. The main meaning is to temporarily adopt a flexible exchange rate. After a considerable period, a permanent exchange rate will be determined. Starting from the 4th of this month, the exchange measures have been decided and implemented. Now foreign exchange and all prices are showing a considerable decision. After the opening of foreign exchange, foreign trade can be smooth. All kinds of materials can be increased according to the needs of the people. The inflow of floating capital into the speculative market to promote price fluctuations can also be brought into the commercial track. Foreign raw materials and machinery can also be imported in a continuous stream due to the restoration of foreign trade, which can be used to match the development of domestic industry, which is enough to increase production and achieve the effect of stabilizing prices. Therefore, opening up foreign trade can stabilize people's hearts at home and guide investment abroad, giving our economic construction an important boost. I have never dared to express too many opinions on economics, finance, and finance, but I feel that the government's opening up of foreign trade measures is indeed certain. The quantity of our country's exports and imports can be based on pre-war statistics. Now that we have foreign credit loans, we can purchase a large number of things. There are also a large number of supplies for post-disaster relief. There is no doubt that the amount of exports and imports can be offset. I have heard people who do not understand the content say that the government's allocated 500 million US dollars of legal tender reserve can be used up in three months. I dare to say responsibly that the measures currently adopted can be maintained and used for a long time, and there is absolutely no danger of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Overcome All Difficulties and Establish an Economic Foundation</p>
<p>I believe that our party, led by the President, has won the victory of the War of Resistance and will definitely be able to lead the people of the whole country to move towards the road of construction. Now there is a plan to overcome the current economic environment. Although this plan is ordinary and requires a considerable period of time, it is indeed down-to-earth. I am convinced that if we use the same determination as the War of Resistance, we will be able to overcome all difficulties. We will be able to see some results in the next two months, and make more progress after four months. It is possible to lay the foundation for the preparatory work for national economic construction by the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Hull is Concerned About World Affairs, Calls on All Countries to Cooperate, There Should Be No Suspicion in the World Community</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Former Secretary of State Hull, in view of the world's unease, issued a statement today, calling on all countries to cooperate, recognizing this as the only way to maintain peace. It is said that the completion of the United Nations organization depends on the spirit of cooperation, and this spirit of cooperation is fundamentally related to the attitude of each country in the world community. In this kind of world society, there should be no suspicion and distrust among them. The relationship between the five major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and China is particularly important. If these countries cannot recognize their common welfare, it will cause indescribable disasters. The current "impatience" between countries should be due to war fatigue. This spirit must be overcome by examining each other's views with compassion and patience. We who survived the gunfire must not allow mankind to tend towards suicide again due to lack of vision, selfishness, inability to tolerate each other, or provocative actions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said at a meeting of the committee today, advocating that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union meet again to frankly discuss various issues.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Personal Views on Principles for Revising the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>— Wu Shangying</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference has modifications regarding the constitutional provisions, established a Constitution Draft Review Committee, based on the principles of modification, taking into consideration the amended draft from the Constitutional Government Preparation Committee, the research results of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and opinions submitted from all sides; compiling and organizing these into a revised version of the May 5th Draft Constitution to be submitted to the National Assembly for adoption. As an expert, I participated in the Review Committee, and heard opinions from all sides, mostly focused on the two issues of the relationship between the National Assembly and the legislative and executive branches, with differing views on each. The significant reason for these differences lies in the acceptance or non-acceptance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of the division of powers, while superficially claiming to accept the legacy of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. Amidst this ambivalent thinking, there is a difficulty in reconciling such positions. Furthermore, speaking practically, various political parties inevitably have their own vested interests, so the reason for modifying the May 5th Draft Constitution may lie in this rather than in other factors; hence it is dismissed as a political issue. Since there are so many contradictory facts among them, it is beyond what theory can reconcile.</p>
<p>Now, I ask to look at this issue with the most objective attitude, excluding partisan bias and emotion, and express some opinions as a reference. My humble thoughts may be deemed acceptable by the wise and virtuous of the party and the nation.</p>
<p>Regarding the chapters of the May 5th Draft Constitution concerning the National Assembly and the central political system, the Political Consultative Conference considers this type of system to be indirect democracy, which cannot achieve the purpose of democratic politics; therefore, it is proposed that the members of the Legislative Yuan should be directly elected by voters, with their powers equivalent to those of parliaments in democratic countries. The appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan should be nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, and he should be responsible to the Legislative Yuan; if the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. Whether this method is more appropriate than the original May 5th Draft Constitution should be comparatively studied. Now, I will mention the main points of difference:</p>
<p>(1) In the original May 5th Draft Constitution, the President, Vice-President, Political Councilors, Ministers of various ministries, and Chairmen of various committees of the Executive Yuan are appointed and dismissed by the President, and each is responsible to the President; and because the President is elected by the National Assembly, he is responsible to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>(2) According to the modification principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the entire Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan; and the Legislative Yuan is directly elected by voters, so when the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, to show the intention of being responsible.</p>
<p>(3) In the May 5th Draft Constitution, the National Assembly has the power to impeach the President, Vice-President, and the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, as well as members of the Legislative and Control Yuan; because they are all elected by the National Assembly, the National Assembly has the power to impeach them, which expresses that each of these officials is responsible to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, the National Assembly in the May 5th Draft Constitution represents the people in exercising central governing power and has the power to elect and impeach central officials; when disputes arise between the executive and legislative branches, they can be resolved by impeachment when necessary. This does not damage the President's position and prestige, nor does it cause national affairs to fall into stagnation, and there is no concern about the government's position being unstable.</p>
<p>Now, according to the modification principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan; when the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. When the Legislative Yuan is dissolved, it is necessary to hold another election; during the election period, political affairs will inevitably be in a state of stagnation, and the election is time-consuming, which greatly affects political affairs. Even in normal times, there will inevitably be political tides and unrest in the political situation. How is this better than the National Assembly exercising the power of impeachment, which can be resolved directly and quickly?</p>
<p>Those who advocate the method of no-confidence and dissolution as a balance between the legislative and executive branches argue that because the Legislative Yuan is a directly elected body, the Executive Yuan being responsible to it is closer to the ideal of democratic politics. However, in the May 5th Draft Constitution, both the President and the Legislative Yuan are elected by the National Assembly. Furthermore, the powers of recall, initiative, and referendum are all exercised by the National Assembly rather than directly by the people. The Legislative Yuan is responsible to the National Assembly, and the Executive Yuan is responsible to the President, all of which are indirect democracy and further away from the ideal of democratic politics.</p>
<p>We should know that what China needs most at the present time is political stability. Dictatorship and autocracy make the people dissatisfied and cannot seek the welfare of all the people; therefore, they cannot achieve the purpose of political stability. If there are political tides and the government is constantly in a state of unrest, it also cannot achieve the purpose of political stability. The experience of parliamentary disputes in the early years of the Republic of China can serve as a warning; therefore, the National Assembly system in the May 5th Draft Constitution may be different from parliamentary politics in Europe and America, and the exercise of civil rights may be indirect, but it generally reduces the risk of political tides and unrest in the political situation compared to the parliamentary system. At the same time, it can effectively supervise officials below the President, preventing it from degenerating into autocracy. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, after years of comparative research on the political systems of various European and American countries, came to this conclusion and established it as the Outline of National Reconstruction, which is worth careful consideration. There is no need to be rigid about European and American precedents and be trapped by prejudices, causing the mistakes of the early years of the Republic of China to be repeated.</p>
<p>Some say that the term of office of the National Assembly representatives in the May 5th Draft Constitution is six years, and in the fifth and sixth years, they can no longer reflect the correct public opinion at that time; this can be solved by shortening the term of office, or imitating the election method of the United States Senate, where a certain number of members are re-elected every one or two years, which can facilitate communication of public opinion. There are many ways to remedy this.</p>
<p>In short, there is no absolute perfection in political systems. The fundamental plan still lies in implementing local self-governance, cultivating the people's strength, and making them effective supporters of constitutional government, so that there can be hope for the path to democracy. The third clause of the Outline of National Reconstruction states: "Next is civil rights, so the government often guides the people's political knowledge and ability so that they can exercise their right to elect, their right to recall, their right to initiative, and their right to referendum." In the future, all parties and factions should jointly take responsibility for the arduous task of cultivating the people's strength and intelligence, and establish this democratic foundation, so that the implementation of constitutional government will have a bright future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the so-called terms "cabinet system" and "presidential system," the cabinet system originated in the United Kingdom, or is called parliamentary government, and the British often call it responsible government, where the majority party in the House of Commons organizes the cabinet to govern; its cabinet members are all members of the House of Commons, and they combine executive and legislative duties. When the House of Commons does not trust its policies or does not pass its proposed budget or other bills, the cabinet either resigns or requests the dissolution of Parliament to appeal to the national citizens for another election. This system gradually spread from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Romania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Greece. According to Garner, a professor of political science at the University of Illinois in the United States, in his book "Political Science and Government," the chapter on cabinet government states: "Even China and Japan have some elements of this system."</p>
<p>The so-called presidential system is practiced in the United States and is adopted by most Latin American countries. The powers and terms of office of the president are stipulated in the constitution; he has full power to select his administrative personnel (or can be directly called his administrative subordinates) without interference from Congress, but the appointment must be formally approved by Congress. All administrative personnel are responsible to the President; the President is the head of the executive branch and has the power to ask Congress to review the laws and budgets he proposes and to veto resolutions of Congress, but he has no power to dissolve Congress and order another election.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen praised the American presidential system a lot; his constitutional ideals were partly adopted from the American system, and the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution regarding the duties of the president are slightly tinged with American colors and have a basis. However, the American president has no power to dissolve Congress. If conflicts arise between the executive and legislative branches, the president can only use his prestige to appeal to the national people, such as giving public speeches everywhere, or using methods such as the "fireside chats" of the late President Roosevelt in recent years. Therefore, presidential government relies heavily on the president's personality and prestige. The National Assembly that Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated adopting, with the powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, to resolve conflicts between the executive and legislative branches, is precisely to remedy the shortcomings of the presidential system. The revisions to the principles of the National Assembly proposed by the current Political Consultative Conference really need to be reconsidered; it is no wonder that they have attracted the attention of domestic sages. However, there are criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution that are not entirely appropriate, such as the editorial in Ta Kung Pao on the 14th of this month, which even called the May 5th Draft Constitution the most undemocratic constitution, which is really lacking in consideration.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is thought that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution can only be implemented in a one-party government, and when Dr. Sun Yat-sen decided on the principles of the Five-Power Constitution in the past, he may not have thought about the existence of multiple political parties in the country. Mr. Fu Sinian talked about using multi-party politics, and could not think of any other way besides parliamentary politics. I think there is no need to look at it this way. The National Assembly of the Five-Power Constitution is the highest organ representing the people in exercising central governing power; its members are elected by the national voters through universal, equal, and direct methods, and all parties and factions can freely compete in elections, so multi-party politics can be used, and it is not biased towards one-party politics.</p>
<p>Moreover, even more importantly, the political experience since 1946 has failed to achieve constitutional politics, not because of the existence or quality of the constitution, but because of whether the constitution can be effective. Some say that the constitution is not suitable for national conditions, so it cannot be implemented; to which one can only agree with a "yes, yes." May I ask, does the constitution stipulate that the president should publicly swear to uphold the Republic of China, and does that violate Chinese morality or is it not in line with national conditions, that Yuan Shikai dared to become the Hongxian Emperor? May I also ask, is serving the country and the people honestly and legally violating the teachings of our sages and worthies over thousands of years, is it not in line with national conditions, that the corruption of officials is heard every day? Our ancient sages said it well: "When the people are numerous, what more is to be added? Enrich them. When they are enriched, what more is to be added? Teach them." Now, our country has a population of 450 million, which is already numerous, but how many can avoid hunger and cold? Therefore, the government's first responsibility is to give everyone the opportunity to make a living. Guan Zhong said: "Only when the granaries are full can etiquette be known. It has never been heard from ancient times to the present that a people who are lacking can be governed." It is necessary to give everyone the opportunity to find food, and then one can talk about compulsory education, giving everyone the opportunity to be educated. When everyone has food and knowledge, they will naturally ask about politics and naturally reach the road of democracy. At that time, whether it is Yuan Shikai or any one of the 450 million compatriots, no one would dare to play the Hongxian trick again. Ordinary officials dare not be corrupt, and do not need to be corrupt; in the end, everyone must have food to eat first. The second clause of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction states: "The first priority of national reconstruction is the people's livelihood, so the government often cooperates with the people to jointly plan the development of industries to meet the four major needs of the people: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; to provide sufficient food, to promote the development of weaving to enrich the people's clothing, to build various types of houses according to large plans to make the people live happily, and to repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's transportation." The third clause talks about civil rights as the next priority. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the people's livelihood comes first, so if the people have no food to eat, then civil rights have no foundation. This time, the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the joint declaration of our allies, and the loud cries of leaders and politicians of various countries also take raising the people's living standards as the first thing; indeed, the nation takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. Only by recognizing this purpose, implementing it, not engaging in empty talk, not covering up, and having all comrades of the party jointly pursue this goal to establish the foundation of democratic politics, can the ideals of the Three Principles of the People naturally become a reality; and the constitutional system will inevitably become better and better day by day. National peace can be expected, and world harmony can be achieved. The so-called freedom of belief, freedom of speech, freedom from want, and freedom from fear are all within it.</p>

<p>Chief Jiang Jingguo's Public Matters in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Jiang Jingguo, Deputy Director of the Soldier Retirement Administration of the Youth Army, arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday (8th), accompanied by Zhu Maozhen, artillery commander of the Northeast Security Command, and Jiang Yaoxiang, a bodyguard from Chairman Chiang's office. They stayed at the Dahua Hotel. Jiang's trip was to instruct the military and political officers of the Youth Army on various preparations related to retirement and to inquire about the opinions of officers and soldiers of the army regarding retirement. It is said that he brought concrete plans to select 300 outstanding officers and soldiers from the Youth Army, who will be sent abroad by the government for further studies to continue contributing to the revolutionary cause. Yesterday morning, Wu, the division commander of the 208th Division of the 31st Army of the Youth Army, rushed from Yuhang to receive instructions. In the afternoon, Jiang summoned the students of the Central Cadre School in Hangzhou. Within days, he may go to Shaoxing to inspect the 209th Division of the Youth Army there. Last night, Jiang accepted invitations from Wu, the officer of the Zhejiang Branch of the Youth League, and Zhou, the mayor of Hangzhou, for a banquet at the Lou Wai Lou restaurant on West Lake.</p>

<p>Relief Milk Powder to Be Distributed Soon. The Relief and Relief General Office's Suzhou-Ningbo branch has already distributed a large batch of milk powder and other relief supplies that were previously transported to various counties for distribution to the elderly, weak women and children, infants, and poor and sick patients by the Relief and Relief Association. Fearing that the supplies would deteriorate over time, it has telegraphed the county Relief and Relief Association to quickly report the distribution methods for verification, so as to facilitate rapid distribution.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Business Tax. The county Chamber of Commerce recently received an official letter from the Direct Tax Branch Bureau to collect income tax and profit tax for the 34th year, and also to collect business tax for November and December of the 34th year. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce noted that land tax for the 34th year had been ordered to be exempted for one year, but income tax, profit tax, and business tax were instead being retroactively collected. It convened a meeting of representatives from various industries and resolved to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to request exemption from retroactive collection. Moreover, the tax collection and exemption measures also stipulated that if a place was suffering from severe military affairs or bandit disasters, taxes could be exempted for three months. Wuxi suffered severe military disasters, and the city's houses were completely destroyed, which meets the requirements for exemption for three months. Therefore, the business community unanimously strives to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>The Former Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Political Affairs Department Was Detained. Xu Gui, also known as Xu Danchu, who once served as the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Political Affairs Department, hid in Shanghai after the victory to avoid arrest. He then secretly came to Changzhou, residing in Baima Sansitu Street, changing his name to conceal his identity. Recently, the county government received a secret report that Xu was in Changzhou and ordered the political police to go to the address and arrest him. During the interrogation by the military law adjudicator, he confessed that he had served as a member of the Puppet Military Commission, a member of the First Front Army, a commissioner of the Fourth District of the Huaihai Province, and concurrently as the director of the political affairs office, the director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, and the director of the Political Affairs Department. After obtaining the confession, the county government dispatched police the next day to escort the suspect to the Jiangsu High Court for investigation.</p>

<p>The Provincial Order to Purchase 50,000 Shi of Military Rice. Last year, the provincial government did not assign Jiangyin to purchase military grain because the county's order had not been restored and it had suffered the greatest sacrifices and losses during the War of Resistance. Now, the provincial government believes that the amount of grain collected from various counties is insufficient, so it telegraphed County Magistrate Fang to assign the purchase of 50,000 yuan, with the price set at 5,000 yuan per shi. Local people believe that this price difference is still limited compared to the rice price of more than 7,000 yuan last winter. Now the rice price is 23,000 to 24,000 yuan per shi, which is a huge difference. There is little surplus grain among the farmers at this time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain has not yet arrived, and purchasing is very difficult. They request the provincial government to appeal.</p>

<p>Traitor Zhao Huchen Sentenced to Death. Zhao Huchen, a well-known traitor in this county, formerly worked in the puppet Ningbo Security Team, committing many evils that the people hated. After the liberation of Ningbo, he was arrested by the Zhenhai County Government and sent to the Sixth District Security Command. Commander Yu presented the case to the Provincial Security Command, which has now ordered that Zhao Huchen be sentenced to death for conspiring with the enemy and resisting the country.</p>

<h3>The 21st Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father; A Tree Planting Ceremony Was Held Yesterday; Mayor Qian Personally Presided Over the Ceremony in Zhongzheng Park</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday was the 21st anniversary of the death of the Founding Father and the first Arbor Day after the victory. The entire city flew flags at half-mast. Government agencies and public and private schools were closed for one day, and all parks were open free of charge for the public to enjoy. The municipal government held a tree planting ceremony at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in Zhongzheng Park (i.e., Hongkou Park) at the end of North Sichuan Road. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Mayor He Dehui, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Deputy Garrison Commander Li Ji, bureau chiefs and deputy bureau chiefs Wu Xianfu, Xuan Qianwu, Zhao Zenjue, Li Ximou, Yu Songyun, Pu Zhengdong, Zhao Zu, and Ding Guitang, Xu Jilun, Yan Huiqing, and representatives from various agencies attended the ceremony with more than a hundred people.</p>
<p>Planting New Trees in Front of the Memorial Hall</p>
<p>At 10:10 a.m., in the drizzle, the memorial ceremony was held. Mayor Qian presided over the ceremony and gave a speech after the ceremony. He briefly stated: "The meaning of planting trees is very significant, not only does it enhance the beauty of the city, but it also helps the health of the citizens. In the past, during the period when the enemy and puppet occupied Shanghai, the trees in Shanghai were severely damaged by the enemy and puppet. The municipal government has already paid attention to this, so it has instructed the competent authorities to supervise the progress and ask the entire citizens to assist in promoting it." After the speech, he walked to the base of the Zhongzheng Memorial Hall amidst the melodious sound of military music and began planting. Mayor Qian planted the first juniper, followed by Deputy Mayor He, Deputy Commander Li, Chairman Wang Lin, each planting one tree. The Public Works Bureau also allocated several lawns in the park as places for the press, financial community, judicial community, and heads of various central agencies of the city to plant trees. A total of more than 300 trees, including cypress trees, poplar trees, locust trees, juniper trees, and French sycamore trees, were planted. From then on, several new branches were added to Zhongzheng Park, swaying in the wind. The ceremony concluded at 10:40 a.m. At the same time, the Special Party Department of the Republic of China Seamen and the Republic of China Seamen's Union also held a memorial service in the auditorium of the department on Zhapu Road. Starting at 7:00 p.m., Mayor Qian gave a broadcast speech to the citizens of the city on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station to commemorate the death of the Founding Father and also to promote the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Aviation Construction Association.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Third Front Army, has been ordered to take up the important position of Commander of the Northeast Security. He is scheduled to depart from Shanghai this week and will fly directly to Changchun to take office. According to Zheng, he has been in Shanghai for half a year and has made no great contribution to the local area. This time, due to the ill health of Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, he was ordered to go and assist in acting as commander. He hopes to train and strengthen the army on the one hand and maintain local security on the other.

<h3>The Prerequisite for Industrialization in Sichuan Province; The First Priority is to Solve the Transportation Problem; Sichuan Financier Yang Can San Speaks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, the reporter visited Yang Can San, a giant Sichuan financier. Yang is the chairman of Juxingcheng Bank. The bank has branches in various cities in the Yangtze River Basin. He himself has just come to Shanghai from the rear area. The main points of what he said are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Exchange: According to Yang, although Chongqing has also opened up foreign exchange, there have not been many applicants because the procedures are cumbersome. Inland floating capital has flocked to Shanghai, mainly because the call loan interest rate in this city is higher, and there are more ways to use funds.</p>
<p>(2) Construction of Sichuan Province: Plans for the construction of Sichuan had been advocated by people of insight such as Yang before the war. The prerequisite for industrialization is to solve the transportation problem. Although the highways in Sichuan Province can be said to be smooth, they are still heavily blocked to the outside world, making it difficult to import machinery. Even after industrial products are manufactured, transportation and sales will be very difficult. Sichuan is now concentrated with talent and has many raw materials, but it must wait until the transportation problem is resolved before it can move towards industrialization. It is expected that it will take at least several years before there is any progress.</p>
<p>(3) The Export Industry in the Yangtze River Basin: After the war, the people in the area were excited and eager to restore the previous export trade. Therefore, a large number of such enterprises were established in cities along the river, but the prospects are not optimistic. Currently, only pig hair can be exported in large quantities from China. The output of silk and tea has fallen sharply, and it is difficult to expect development until the transportation problem is resolved.</p>
<p>In summary, what Yang said is that solving transportation is the top priority of all problems. For example, it is not easy for the relief goods from the Relief and Relief General Office to arrive in Shanghai and to be transported to the inland. The inconvenience of transportation leads to a large difference in prices inside and outside, and the fluctuation of funds affects the entire financial situation.</p>
<h3>New Type of Gasoline Train to Operate from the 15th</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, in order to facilitate traffic on both lines, has decided to operate a new type of gasoline train starting on the 15th. The vehicles have been assembled by the Transportation Department, repainted, and the interior is quite exquisite. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it departs from Shanghai to Wuxi, stopping only at Suzhou. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, it departs from Shanghai to Hangzhou, stopping at Jiaxing. The fare for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is 6,000 yuan, and the fare for the Shanghai-Wuxi line is 4,000 yuan. The speed of the vehicle is about four hours from Shanghai to Hangzhou and about two hours from Shanghai to Wuxi. Each vehicle has 68 seats and is currently only available for use by public officials or for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Rises Slightly; The Minzu Cargo Ship Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has recently risen slightly. According to the shipping industry's report from Hankou, the Hankou water level is 11 feet, Daijiazhou is 12 feet 5 inches, Zhangjiazhou is 11 feet, Shazhou is 11 feet and a half, and Dongliu Xishui Road is 14 feet. Large ships on the Yangtze River line can gradually move. The Minzu and Jiangan were scheduled to set sail yesterday, but the Minzu set sail at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday due to the delay in loading fuel, and the Jiangan was rescheduled to depart this morning. The Minyu is scheduled to sail to Yichang on Friday morning, and will sail to Hankou on Saturday after the repairs are completed. About 20 Jiang ships, large and small, are being repaired in Shanghai. They can be completed within three weeks and gradually set sail. At that time, transportation can be smooth.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Inspects Garrison Troops</h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Office, came to Shanghai from Xuzhou the month before last and resided in a hotel.

It is reported that Gu's mission to Shanghai has been completed, and he will leave Shanghai and return north to Xuzhou in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Trucks Stole Copper and Iron; Bandits Fired Guns to Resist Arrest; Four Giant Transport Vehicles Were Intercepted; All Except Drivers and Laborers Escaped; Gunfire in Wusong Late at Night</h3>
<p>The goods produced by the Zhonghua Steel Factory, a Japanese-owned factory in Xujiazhai, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, are mostly military supplies. After the victory, the出　　(likely referring to 接管: taking over) Committee sent personnel to take over. A lot of iron and steel raw materials were piled up in the factory. In recent months, there have been no less than ten thefts. The loss of machinery and property is heavy. The 9th squadron of the 3rd Battalion of the Wusong District Guard Corps is only two miles away from the factory. It sends out patrols every night to strengthen security. At about 7:30 p.m. the night before last, about 20 members of the Guard Corps were on patrol. At about 9:15 p.m., they saw a giant truck at the door loaded with a large amount of steel, driving out of the factory. The members of the Corps shouted for them to stop, but the bandits on the truck actually</p>
<p>Fired Guns to Resist Arrest. The members of the Corps returned fire, and fought for more than ten minutes, about forty or fifty rounds, without any casualties. The Xitangqiao Police Station to the south suddenly opened fire. Inspector Guo led all the police officers and arrived following the sound. Who knew that the bandits who fired the guns in the darkness had already escaped. Only No. 14363, No. 35681, No. 35741 were intercepted.</p>
<p>Three Transport Trucks and a giant Jeep truck No. 41056. Three Chinese drivers, Gao Jusheng, Zhang Jintao, Huang Shousheng, etc., and another White Russian named Demushafu, along with 14 laborers, were taken into custody at the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau for verification. When the incident occurred, the Shanghai Municipal Management Bureau and the responsible branch bureau received telephone reports one after another and dispatched armed police vehicles to the countryside to suppress the bandits. Due to the rain and mud, they arrived at 11:00 p.m. The reporter went to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate. According to Qian Jiafu, the squadron leader of the 9th squadron of the Guard Corps, and Jiang, the deputy captain of the squadron, the area is surrounded by</p>
<p>Warehouses everywhere. Theft cases occur frequently. They hold weapons and brazenly park several trucks in front of the door, then break in and tie up the guards one by one, move a large amount of materials, and drive away before dawn. The whole process is the same. According to Yu Jie, the director of the Jiangwan Branch Bureau, the facts are roughly the same, but one American-style Jeep car has been stolen and driven away by the American side, carrying some copper and iron. The remaining</p>
<p>Three Transport Vehicles are still stored here. The vehicles are probably rented from a transportation company. Since the police officers who investigated the theft have not yet returned, the full truth is not known. According to the arrested drivers, they only knew that they were going to the countryside to load wheat and did not know about stealing copper and iron. When asked whether the case would be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau or the Garrison Headquarters, it was said that the entire process of the case had to be thoroughly investigated before a decision could be made. The judicial authorities have been ordered to arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Will Do Its Best to Provide Information; To Assist in the Trial of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>Most of the Japanese war criminals with obvious crimes are Japanese military police personnel. The U.S. military is paying close attention to this and will do its best to assist the Shanghai Military Tribunal of China in trying Japanese war criminals by providing information at any time.</p>
<h3>Water and Wood Workers March in Procession to Petition, Tailoring and Fashion Store Employees Go on Strike, Posting Slogans and Assaulting Many</h3>
<p>New Problems Arise After Department Store Labor Dispute is Resolved</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The labor unrest in the city's water and wood industries has intensified since two workers in Hongkou were mistakenly injured and killed by members of the Security Corps due to a conflict. Yesterday morning, workers in these industries formed a procession to petition, posting slogans along the way to attract attention from all sectors. In the afternoon, they also gathered for discussions at the Carpentry Workers' Union in the Nanshi district. To uncover the</p>
<p>True Story of the Labor Unrest, our reporter paid a special visit to a construction company yesterday. A representative explained the situation as follows: The workers' wages were originally 1,050 yuan per worker (excluding meals). After the cost of living rose sharply, the workers requested an adjustment in their pay and have held several consultations. Finally, on March 6th, representatives from the Construction Industry Association and the Water and Wood Industries Workers' Union reached a final decision together. From March 16th, the wage for carpenters was adjusted to 2,600 yuan per worker and the wage for plumbers was adjusted to 2,570 yuan per worker, both excluding meals. At the time, five representatives from the Workers' Union and nine workers signed the agreement. A notice was published in the Shenbao and Xinwen newspapers on March 9th, 10th, and 11th and a formal notification was sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. However, the workers were not satisfied and have not resumed work to this day. Moreover, the worker representatives have been avoiding meetings for some reason. The construction company believes that since the worker representatives were legitimately elected, the decisions they made are valid. Now, some workers are overturning the previous agreement and making new demands, which the company cannot accept. The matter is still pending arbitration by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Department Stores (Our Newspaper Report) Regarding the labor dispute involving Yong'an and the ten other major department stores, the Social Affairs Bureau decided that the maximum base salary for employees should be 60 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index. Therefore, the companies were supposed to resume operations starting Monday. However, the management felt dissatisfied and intended to apply for further arbitration. Upon hearing this news, the employees gathered their representatives again yesterday and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Zhang received them and stated that he would do his best to uphold the established principles.</p>
<p>Hotel Workers Due to the soaring prices of goods in the city, the hotel industry submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to increase room rates by 40%. However, the industry has not increased workers' wages accordingly. This has led the workers' group representatives to question the union and demand that wages be increased in proportion to the room rate increase. The union immediately sent a letter to the industry association requesting a response. As of yesterday, the hotels had not taken any action on the wage issue. It is reported that the workers believe this is a deliberate delay and are planning to respond with a work slowdown.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth Industry Labor Unrest (Our Newspaper Report) The employees of various woolen cloth and fashion stores in the city receive meals from their employers but no salary. They rely solely on commissions deducted from customers' custom-made clothing. Now, due to the soaring prices of goods, the employees are jointly demanding that the employers provide additional salaries and allowances. The terms are as follows: Employees of stores on Ma Road and Hubei Road should be paid wages in three grades: 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 yuan. Employees of stores on Avenue Joffre and Route Say Zou should be paid wages in three grades: 50,000, 60,000, and 70,000 yuan. Employees of stores on Nanjing East Road and Nanjing West Road should be paid in three grades: 80,000, 90,000, and 100,000 yuan. After the employees submitted their demands to the stores on the 9th, the employers argued that the employees' commissions already exceeded these amounts and therefore could not accept the demands. Because their demands were not met, employees of dozens of stores, including Hongxiang Fashion Company, began a work slowdown yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Gang of Japanese Attempted Robbery, One Killed in the Act</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) At around 4:00 PM yesterday, four Japanese men in plain clothes were seen loitering near the No. 4 Bridge on Zhenru Township Zhenjiang Road, wielding guns and bayonets to threaten passersby in an attempt to rob them. This was witnessed by members of the 9th Squad, 3rd Battalion of the Zhenru Township Shanghai Security Corps, who bravely rushed forward. They shot and killed one of the Japanese men on the spot. The remaining three Japanese men were captured and taken back to the squad headquarters, reported to the battalion headquarters, and then transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Police Bravely Chase Thieves in Two Incidents Morning and Evening, Two People Injured</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) At approximately 7:30 AM yesterday, at the temporary business office of the Victory Rubber Company at No. 261 Zhejiang Road, a bandit suddenly knocked on the door with a gun, falsely claiming to want to buy rubber. After being tricked into opening the door, the bandit immediately closed it and forced the apprentice Xu Shaoqiu to hand over the keys. At that moment, the store owner Li Meisheng arrived and knocked on the door. Alarmed, one of the bandits opened the door and fled first, while the other bandit also ran out, fleeing along Zhejiang Road to Hankou Road, turning west onto Guangxi Road. Li quickly followed in pursuit, shouting "Thief!" along the way. A passerby, Zhang Liangen, happened to be passing by and, upon hearing the shouts of "Catch the thief!", saw a man running towards him who looked suspicious. He bravely stepped forward and grabbed the man around the waist. The bandit, in a panic, pulled out a gun and fired two shots, one bullet hitting Zhang's left arm, causing him to fall near the entrance of the sanitation sub-office. The bandit eventually managed to escape. The injured Zhang was later sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in a police car.</p>
<p>At 9:30 PM last night at Dongxin Bridge, a Ningbo peddler named Lin Dingsheng (21 years old) had his briefcase suddenly stolen by a bandit who fled. Lin gave chase but was shot once by the bandit, hitting his right thigh. He was later sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Li Ze's Assets, Informant has Already Reported, Defense Lawyers to Fly to Chongqing Soon</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) Since the third trial of the Li Ze case, both the informant and the defendant have presented a great deal of evidence. The High Court has been busy investigating this evidence in recent days. It is understood that the court has ordered the informant's side to investigate Li Ze's assets, and the informant has already submitted a report. As Li Ze's two defense lawyers, Zhang Shizhao and Chen Tingrui, will be flying to Chongqing soon to attend the Political Consultative Conference, the case is unlikely to go to court in the near future.</p>
<h3>Yang Xizhi to Fly to America Tomorrow to Attend UN General Assembly to Demand Fair Distribution of Food</h3>
<p>Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of Food Administration, will fly to America tomorrow on a US military plane to attend the Fourth General Assembly of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Atlantic City. Yang is an advisor to the Chinese delegation. He originally planned to travel with Jiang Yien, Director-General of the Executive Yuan, the day before yesterday, but his departure was postponed to tomorrow because the details of the loan agreement still needed to be discussed. He is expected to arrive in America in three days. At this assembly, Yang will present a report on the overall food situation in China and demand a fair distribution of food from UNRRA. In addition, Yang will also contact South Asian countries in America to purchase a large amount of rice for shipment to China to provide relief. Yang himself will not go to South Asia. It is reported that the Ministry of Food will send a special commissioner to Singapore to discuss specific food purchasing arrangements with the producing countries.</p>
<p>If the matter cannot be resolved on its own within a few days, an application will be made to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The workers in the industry declared a strike yesterday and were forced to post slogans that were torn down three times. At the time, some workers who were posting slogans were assaulted by dozens of people without any explanation. Four or five people sustained minor injuries and one person, named Lu Ruizheng, was seriously injured. He was later sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is alleged that the assailants were hired by the management.</p>
<p>British Tramways Following the arrest of three British tramway company worker representatives Xue, etc., on suspicion of being traitors, the workers have repeatedly gone on strike to demand their release. However, as the case has been legally transferred to the court for investigation and trial, they cannot be easily released. Therefore, yesterday's efforts to secure their release were unsuccessful. The Special Criminal Court of the High Court will continue to hear the case in the coming days. At that time, the plaintiff will be summoned to appear in court to provide evidence of the allegations.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The labor unrest in the city's underwear industry was resolved the day before yesterday after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. It was agreed that wages would be increased by 250% compared to November of last year. The labor unrest thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Memorial Tower for the Unknown Heroes to be Built in Fuxing Park after Redrawing Designs and Estimating Costs and Raising Funds Again</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city have previously decided to build a "Memorial Tower for the Unknown Heroes" in Fuxing Park (formerly the French Park) to commemorate the war heroes and the deceased compatriots. However, due to the large construction costs, work has been difficult to start for some time.

Then, the various agencies will open booths to solicit donations again. The construction is scheduled to begin in April or May.</p>

<p>(Our Newspaper Report) It has been confirmed that the corpse of the beautiful woman found on the platform of the Taishan Public Apartment is Chen Huifang, a prostitute from a brothel at No. in Fuzhili, Beihai Road. After marrying her husband Yue NianZhao, she was found to be promiscuous and cheated, and then became involved with someone else, with whom she had a son named Qiaosheng. Four years ago, she reunited with her ex-husband and had another son. This sudden assassination is feared to be a result of love affairs and disputes.

<h3>Clearing out Vagrants and Beggars, Separate Accommodation and Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>In order to maintain local security and tidy up the city, the Municipal Police Bureau is now starting to clear out vagrants and beggars from the streets. According to the bureau's recent statistics, the total number of vagrants and beggars actively rounded up by the various sub-bureaus reached 2,636. All of them are addicted to opium and have been sent to the Caohejing Vagrant Rehabilitation Center for rehabilitation. Along the Suzhou Creek, from Waibaidu Bridge to Xinlaji Bridge and other bridge piers, there were child beggars who were driven by beggar organizations. They often hindered passing vehicles and passengers, and even stole goods being transported. This month, the police sub-bureaus in the area have been instructed to strictly investigate and detain them. The child beggars have now been completely cleared out.</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Chiefs Have an Obligation to Fill out National Identity Application Forms</h3>

(2) Domestic helpers employed in various places should be registered as separate households if they have no family relations. (3) If the applicant is unable to fill out the application form for national identity, the neighborhood chief has an obligation to fill it out on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Weight Limit for Newsprint Mail Relaxed</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The Executive Yuan’s Temporary Office in Shanghai formerly instructed the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to temporarily halve the original limit for airmail to the north from 400 kg per flight to 200 kg because of the large number of personnel arriving from the northeast to be transported. Because correspondence is important to the public and cannot be restricted, the post office temporarily stopped accepting newspaper mail starting on the 6th of this month. It has been learned that the Civil Aviation Administration of the Executive Yuan has sent a letter to CNAC, increasing the weight limit to 350 kg to serve both needs. The CNAC’s northern flights are only three times a week: two to Tianjin, one to Jinan. Each flight can only carry about ten passengers, but there are already over a thousand government employees registered to fly north, so limiting mail volume is still ineffective. It has been reported that a request is being prepared to the National Ship Allocation Committee to allocate more ships for transportation.</p>

<h3>Bank of China Continues to Supply Gold Bars, Market Gradually Stabilizing, Down 50,000 from the Previous Day</h3>
<p>The gold bar market was extremely stable yesterday. Opening prices were flat, hovering around 1.7 million for a time. Market participants lacked enthusiasm, and long positions were also settled, falling to 1.64 million. Around 10:00 AM, prices struggled slightly at 1.65 million, and the Bank of China sold 340 bars at this price. Market participants, learning from the losses of the previous day, tightened their stomachs, and the market situation was therefore more stable. As of noon, prices were still hovering around 1.67 million, extremely sluggish. The afternoon was the same, with a lack of activity from all parties. Jewelers' quoted prices remained unchanged, and speculators disappeared. As a result, prices fell by another 50,000, with jewelry gold at 180,000 yuan, silver at 1,800 yuan, and silver dollars remaining unchanged. Black market trading was not active due to a lack of speculation, and demand was not great. Credit remained loose, with interest rates ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange USD was mediocre. The capital reported a rise, and the opening was stable, struggling around 2,100 yuan. Importers favored telegraphic transfers to Hong Kong, and buying interest declined slightly. Later on, it consistently succumbed to around 2,060 yuan, with no significant changes. The afternoon was the same, with a relaxed trend. As a result, prices fell by another 50 yuan compared to the previous closing. Old Hong Kong goods were still stimulated by telegraphic transfers and rose by another 5 yuan. New goods were flat and weak, falling by another 2 yuan. US telegraphic transfers were not seen. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were between 430 and 450 yuan. Rupees remained at the original price of 540 yuan.</p>
<h3>Retail Investors Greedy for Cheap Bonds, Public Debt Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Public debt is still a target for retail investors. Regardless of the actual substance, floating funds are used as chips for speculation. This phenomenon will continue until after the principal and interest are formally repaid. During this period, there will still be general small accounts, voluntarily taking cheap positions. Type C opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning, and the lowest was 1,400 yuan. It hovered around 1,550 yuan for a long time. Ultimately, due to the stock market's resurgence and under the mobilization in the case, it rose again to 1,700 yuan before noon and then stabilized slightly. As a result, Type C bonds, which rose by 150 yuan, were the hottest, while the rest fell by 50 to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coarse Grains Shipped to North China</h3>
<p>Large quantities of coarse grains were shipped to North China. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou transported 33,000 bags of wheat to Tianjin, to be unloaded at Tanggu. All of it is for relief for the poor. There are also tens of thousands of bags of flour, which will be shipped to Qingdao in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Several Issues Remain Before Stock Exchanges Reopen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It was reported yesterday that the city's stock exchanges will gradually resume operations, with the gold exchange taking the lead. Yesterday, this reporter revisited a relevant party, who informed us: the reopening of stock exchanges will still take some time. Firstly, the various companies still have a variety of procedures to complete. Furthermore, regarding the external shareholders of the former Public Association of All Industries, the issue of their legal status is still under consideration before the new Company Law is finalized and promulgated. As for the rumor that Mr. Yu Huancheng will assume the position of Chairman of the Board, there is indeed such talk. During a recent meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Securities Industry Association, Mr. Du Yuesheng expressed that he was physically weak and ill, and feared that he would be unable to continue serving as the Chairman of the Association. Given Mr. Yu's qualifications and reputation, he would certainly be competent for the role, but no decision was made at the time.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton futures and spot prices fell by nine to thirteen points. The near-term price was US$26.90, the forward price was US$26.53, and the Mittineague spot price was US$27.32. The local cotton market continued to rise. However, due to the closure of the spot yarn market, most factories adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Jin Fang Jian Company purchased 200 bales of Mittineague cotton at a factory price of 90,000 yuan. Fellow traders purchased Pu Zi cotton seeds at a price of 19,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The cotton cloth market remained sluggish, with buyers still taking a wait-and-see approach. The Jin Fang Jian Company continued to sell cotton cloth as usual yesterday.</p>
<h3>Refined Sugar Remains Tight</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of sugar leaving warehouses, the market remained slightly tight. First-grade white sugar was offered at 53,000 to 54,000 yuan. The lack of stock of refined sugar led sellers to adopt a wait-and-see approach, and no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods Arrive in Large Quantities, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Three ships carrying northern goods from Tianjin arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 15,000 pieces, causing market weakness. "Tong Shou Yuan" dates were offered at 40,000 yuan, and "Jiang You Tou Rong" sauce at 50,000 yuan, both lower than before, and there were very few buyers.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Scarce, Prices Stable</h3>
<p>"Jing Ming Qi Qiang" tea has always been welcomed by local and out-of-town buyers, and its sales volume has been considerable over the years. The new crop is about to come onto the market before the Qingming Festival. Recently, traders have been gathering funds to absorb the new crop. Therefore, buyers are hesitant to move forward, resulting in sluggish transactions. As for prices, large dealers are still holding firm, but general small dealers are eager to sell, resulting in prices remaining stable for now, but the underlying support is weakening.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Administration Distributes Cooking Oil</h3>
<p>Entrusting Vegetable Oil Factories to Handle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Vegetable Oil Material Factory has recently been entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration to handle the distribution of cooking oil for the first time. Anyone who meets one of the following conditions can register: Those who were genuinely retail sellers of cooking oil in the past. Those who have storefronts. Those who are members of the industry association. Those who have a guarantor and a physical store. Those who have daily retail sales of more than three "shi dan". Registration began yesterday and will end in three days.</p>
<h3>Fuel Problem is Severe: Restaurants Use Charcoal, Rice Husks Used at Cooked Water Shops</h3>
<p>The coal market at 405 Tianjin Road was previously ordered by the authorities to prohibit illegal trading, otherwise, severe punishment would be imposed. The industry association issued strict notices informing everyone. However, hoarding and price gouging could not be avoided in practice. Recently, many coal shipments have been transported to Shanghai, mostly from Qinhuangdao in Shandong and along the Yangtze River. Most of them are bituminous coal, followed by white coal and coal dust. On average, about 15,000 to 20,000 tons arrive each week. Therefore, the coal reserves in this city have gradually become sufficient. However, it needs to be widely distributed to meet market needs. Since the market price of coal has repeatedly risen, the general public has been severely threatened. Restaurants, cooked water shops, and bathhouses are particularly hard hit. It is now learned that most restaurants have switched to burning charcoal (steel charcoal), and cooked water shops have switched to burning rice husks to reduce costs. According to unofficial estimates, the current daily consumption of steel charcoal is around 300 "dan," and the daily consumption of rice husks is around 7,500 "dan." Steel charcoal costs 7,000 yuan per "dan," and rice husks cost 2,500 yuan per cart.</p>
<h3>Fuel Control Committee Orders Dyeing and Weaving Industries to Register Factory Coal Usage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs notified the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Association to quickly register the coal used by factories that have already started work in order to carry out examination and investigation procedures. The registration forms have been distributed by the association to the manufacturers, who should fill them out truthfully as soon as possible. Those who have not yet started work should apply for a delay in handling coal allocation. (Wu)</p>
<h3>Light-Colored Woolens Sell Well</h3>
<p>Light-colored woolens were in great demand yesterday, and prices also rose slightly. Buyers continued to purchase more, and stores mostly chose light colors. Actual sales were widespread, and inventories were dwindling. Production could not keep up, and imports from abroad were pending. Standard prices rose step by step accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yuan Nails Fall Back</h3>
<p>Last week, the price of domestic "yuan" nails rose due to enthusiastic purchases by Hankou buyers, causing some price bubble, which pleased traders. However, this was a fleeting moment, and prices soon fell back. Each barrel fell by about 20,000 yuan. Currently, 4-point nails sell for 110,000 yuan, 5-point nails sell for 100,000 yuan, 6-point nails sell for 90,000 yuan, 1-inch nails sell for 75,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails sell for 68,000 yuan, 2-inch nails sell for 65,000 yuan, 2.5-inch nails sell for 63,000 yuan, and 3-inch nails sell for 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Funds Concentrate on Chinese Stocks, Wing On Cotton Mill Breaks 4,000 Barrier</h3>
<p>After the initial stabilization, Chinese stocks became popular, and the situation was heated. After the gold market was controlled, speculative funds concentrated on stocks. Wing On Cotton Mill rose from 3,400 yuan, Mei Ya from 2,500 yuan, and Jingfu from 155 yuan, gradually increasing. The afternoon closing slightly retraced after the gains. Compared to the previous closing, Wing On Cotton Mill and Mei Ya each rose by 200 yuan, and Jingfu rose by 20 yuan. New Guang actively participated, and Dong Xing did not want to be left behind, each rising by 5 yuan, but it was difficult to buy. In the afternoon, those with next-day delivery were further pushed up. Wing On Cotton Mill rose to 4,100 yuan, Mei Ya to 3,150 yuan, and Jingfu to 200 yuan. The underlying sentiment was remarkably bullish. Since foreign stocks closed earlier, the various stocks in the afternoon were slightly lower than the previous closing, and the situation was confusing.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Clearing Statistics</h3>
<p>The amount of bills exchanged at the Shanghai Clearing House last week was 1,592,067,700,048 yuan, with 130,064 bills. The amount of bills exchanged on behalf was 756,956,867,99 yuan, totaling 79,610 bills.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Company's Daily Output: More Than 10,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth and 43,000 Bales of Yarn</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs transferred the puppet textile factories to the China Textile Construction Company for takeover, it has been actively restoring production. According to the company, it currently has 20 units of factories taken over. Except for a small portion that is still being sorted out, 17 units are currently in full operation, including: Factory No. 1 and 2, Factory No. 5, Factory No. 7, Factory No. 9, Toyota Factory No. 1 and 2, Japan-China Factory No. 3 and 4, Japan-China Factory No. 5, 6 and 7, Japan-China Factory No. 8, Tongxing Factory, Dakang Factory No. 1 and 2, Shanghai Factory No. 3, Shanghai Factory No. 4, Shanghai Factory No. 5, Yufeng Yarn Factory, Mingmeng Yarn Factory, Gongda Factory No. 1, and Hengmeng Yarn Factory. The number of spindles in operation has reached more than 370,000. The number of female workers in each factory is more than 11,000, and the number of male workers is one-half of the number of female workers, about 5,000. According to official statistics, the daily output of cloth has reached more than 10,300 bolts, including gabardine, canvas, flannel, twill, and white cloth. The daily output of cotton yarn is more than 43,000 bales, mostly 20s, 32s, and 42s yarn. Other products such as socks and military blankets are also produced, but they account for only a small number.</p>
<h3>Group Procurement is Gradually Being Launched</h3>
<p>Since the restoration, due to various obstacles such as transportation and finance, the source of materials is severely insufficient, resulting in soaring prices and shrinking production. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously issued an order to various industries, advocating group procurement to remedy the situation. Assistance is being provided for transportation and capital turnover. It is learned that many industry associations are very sympathetic and are forming "procurement groups" to equip themselves with vehicles and ships to transport materials. They are also applying to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and relevant agencies to facilitate the transportation of raw materials and goods needed by various industries from various regions, for the use of the industry members. It is reported that dozens of industry associations such as beans and rice associations are already working on it.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Cotton textiles: Due to sluggish sales to buyers, small dealers dumped goods, and prices mostly fell.</p>
<p>Daily necessities: Candles slightly hardened due to absorption by buyers, but soap and matches had few transactions.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Sales were sluggish. Except for the British American Tobacco brand, which remained stable, the others all fell.</p>
<p>Western medicines: The market was quite tight. After the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory temporarily stopped shipping goods, people were optimistic about the future.</p>

<h3>US Education Committee Suggests Revising Doctoral Degree Procedures</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 11th] According to the New York Times, the US Education Committee recently suggested revising the procedures for obtaining a doctoral degree and actively improving the facilities of US university graduate schools, so that students engaged in advanced academic research can obtain greater convenience. Hollis, a senior expert at the US Education Office, conducted an investigation into the work of graduate schools. He pointed out that US higher education institutions' graduate schools are not well-managed. Hollis' report emphasized that US graduate schools generally produce too many narrow-minded experts, whose education is limited to adapting to professional technical skills. According to Hollis, research training rarely allows students to obtain a rich personal and social life within their professional scope.</p>
<p>(Criticizing Doctoral Dissertations) He suggested that research work should originate from the scholar's personal and professional interests. Doctoral dissertations that are only made to meet degree requirements do not contribute to scholarship and may even narrow the education they receive. Dr. Hollis analyzed the records of 22,509 people who received doctoral degrees between 1930 and 1940 and found that 65% held teaching positions in universities, 20% were engaged in industrial research, 10% worked in government agencies, and 5% taught in schools below the university level. 13% of doctoral recipients had jobs unrelated to their training or did not require higher education knowledge. A total of 27% entered careers outside of education. According to the results of Dr. Hollis' interviews with the employers of these doctoral recipients, they all agreed that greater attention should be paid to the personality of the students when selecting and training them.</p>
<p>(Not Limited to Intellectual Training) They emphasized that the ability to cooperate with others and develop a normal sensitivity to social responsibility are as essential to career success as specialized skills. Dr. Hollis concluded that in the next ten years, society will need fewer doctoral graduates, but those with more sound education and capable of practical work. He specifically suggested that the scope of future doctoral training should be broadened, and not limited to intellectual training.</p>

<h3>The Pain of Being Without a Country! Changchun Student Representatives Arrive in Peiping to Speak Out</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Peiping News] More than 500 male and female students from eight schools including the Changchun Military Officers' School in Northeast China have arrived in the city of Peiping after traveling through mountains and rivers and risking their lives. There are more than 30 people in Tianjin, and most are stranded in Jin County. According to representatives of various universities in Northeast China who came to Peiping, before the victory, most university students were forced by the enemy and puppets to serve in various places. After August 15, transportation could not be restored for a while, so the students were scattered. After that, they gradually gathered in Changchun. In early September, the students themselves organized remedial schools, and the University Alliance was established afterwards.</p>
<p>Unanimous Decision to Retreat</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Northeast issue became increasingly complicated. After a meeting, more than 500 students unanimously decided to make a general retreat from Changchun to Peiping. Early in the morning of the 20th of last month, they went to Shenyang by car in batches and arrived in the evening. Because the land that the National Army could truly control was still in Huanggu Village, they moved to Huanggu Village in batches. Then they took a bus to Jin County, where the Northeast Security Command prepared food and accommodation. Due to various difficulties, only a few could come here one after another. They have now contacted the special envoy of the Ministry of Education in the Northeast region, who said that the Northeast Provisional University Remedial Class will be established in Jin County, so students staying in Jin County can stop their journey. The main purpose of their trip to Peiping is to hope that the authorities can give them appropriate jobs, and the second is to obtain travel documents.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Be Slaves Again</p>
<p>The students have suffered all kinds of hardships for fourteen years and deeply feel the pain of being without a country. They will never be slaves again in the future, and they swear not to give up the rich treasures hidden in the black waters and white mountains of Northeast China. Many students in Northeast China</p>
<p>Organized armed groups to deal with lawless troops, and some students covered the landing when the National Army was stationed, which proves the students' patriotism in Northeast China.</p>
<h3>A Tragic History of Education: Principal Disappears Because the School's Life Cannot Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xianju News] Xianju County's Simple Normal School has been exempted from the county's land tax, and the school's student public rations are not available. Since the start of school, very few students have come to school. The salaries of teachers and staff are meager, and the teachers who have been hired have gone elsewhere. Wang Xiangji, the principal of the school, has repeatedly requested the county government to find a way to remedy the situation, but it has not been resolved. The county government gives the school a collection on behalf of the government for the student food and food meter. The monthly salary of the teachers and staff is set by the county government to be between 10,000 and 16,000 yuan. If this is not followed, the county government will not give advice on the monthly salary of the teachers and staff. The principal felt that it was so difficult to handle and could not maintain it. He continued to ask the county government to resign, but he was not allowed. Unexpectedly, on the first day of this month, the principal suddenly disappeared and there was no news. According to his eldest daughter, her father (the principal) never stayed out at night in his life. At 2 pm that afternoon, he claimed that he had something to do on the street, and he never returned. There is no news. She also said that when her father left, he did not bring any luggage, and he had no money with him. He also left three letters of farewell: one to his grandfather, which said: "Father! Your unfilial son feels that it is necessary to leave the world forever. Please don't worry about it. Take good care of your daughter-in-law's womb. Written by your son Ji." One to his colleagues in the school, which said: "Directors of Training, Education, and Affairs: I, because I am incompetent in handling school affairs, therefore say goodbye to you. Before the county government sends someone to take over, please ask the three directors to take care of it and don't feel sorry for my misfortune. Wang Xiangji wrote." One was given to the county government and presented with an official letter, which was his final letter of resignation. Therefore, after the principal disappeared, his family asked the gods for help, making a tearful scene and searching everywhere, but his whereabouts were unknown. It is feared that there are more bad luck than good. (Yu)</p>

<h3>Tongji University, with Thirty-Nine Years of History (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Kainan</p>
<p>When one mentions Tongji University, what first appears in people's minds is a tense picture: in Tongji's unique-style practice factory, young people of different appearances, during different practice times, wield different tools, operate different machines, wear blue workers' clothes, covered in oil stains, sweating, personally and steadfastly engaging in arduous practice. In the classroom, in the dissection room, or in the self-study room, even in today's tea houses, sturdy young men, holding different reference books and almost identical instruments, are tensely, quietly, burying their heads to study alone.</p>
<p>(Relocated to Lizhuang, Sichuan after the war) Lizhuang is in a relatively large valley. The river flows out of the valley in the northwest corner, as if bidding farewell to Lizhuang, lingering affectionately in front of Lizhuang to form a large bay, and then flowing torrentially towards the east, towards her—the old home to which Tongji will return. Behind Lizhuang are mountains, and across the Yangtze River are also mountains. It has tranquil fragrance and beautiful sweetness. In addition to Tongji, there are the Institute of History of the Academia Sinica, the China Museum, the Geodesy Group of the Institute of Geography of the Academia Sinica, and a part of the Institute of Social Sciences of the Academia Sinica. It is about a thousand li away from Chongqing, making it the most suitable place for scholars to conduct research. During the War of Resistance, there was never a report of [空], so Tongji was never disturbed by old reports.</p>
<p>Tongji already has thirty-nine years of history. But Tongji has never been involved in any disturbances, nor has it participated in any off-campus activities. Tongji's consistent school spirit is "hard work with head down." Students are never willing to spend any time shouting meaningless empty slogans, like a pond of lake water, forever quiet to external things. When spring comes, it is like this; when summer comes, it is still like this. When swallows come to seek the traces of "spring" in autumn, the swallows must still ask this quiet green water. Before the War of Resistance, it was like this in Wusong; after the War of Resistance, after the baptism of gunfire, it is still like this now west of the Yangtze River, and it has become even more silent.</p>
<p>(Absolutely No Welcoming or Sending Off Any President) An old professor of Tongji once said in a public lecture: "Today (at that time, during the War of Resistance), the country is in such difficulties, yet it still allocates a large portion of funds for us to study. We should work harder, we should carry forward Tongji's school spirit, we must work hard, work practically, work quickly, work toughly..." Several consecutive "work" characters moved the students' "hearts" to just beat faster. Over the decades, Tongji has had many changes of presidents, but students have never retained any president, nor have they chased away any president. Moreover, when any president first came to the school, no students welcomed him, or held a welcoming meeting after his arrival. Every student's heart, since stepping over the threshold of Tongji, has deeply engraved a seal of "practical work, hard work, tough work," and decided to study, so first study well before anything else. The students' hearts are always entirely placed on books, in the factory, or in the laboratory. The students' hearts are always as sincere and simple as farmers.</p>
<h3>The Bridge Between British and Soviet Spheres of Influence: A Keynote of New International Relations - A Review of the Turkish Question</h3>
<p>Special Article of This Newspaper, Translated from the British Royal Institute of International Affairs’ "The World Today" Monthly</p>
<p>Turkey is in reality a bridge between the spheres of influence of Great Britain and the Soviet Union. The changes in the Turkish political situation have a significant relationship with all countries in the world and can be used to see to what extent a true understanding has been reached between Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Since the 19th century, the Turkish Straits and the Transcaucasian border have become a touchstone of international relations: The Straits reveal the relations between the great powers, and the Transcaucasian border reveals the relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. In other words, according to historical precedent, the Transcaucasian border only becomes a 'problem' when friction has occurred between the Soviet Union and Turkey due to the Straits issue. This problem has always been a major point of contention in Soviet-Turkish relations, and it has become more complicated due to the interference of Western countries for their own conflicting interests.</p>
<p>Based on this, the recent territorial claims made by the Soviet Union regarding Kars and Ardahan (Note: According to the Turkish Foreign Minister's broadcast on January 17, the Soviet side has not formally made a request to change the territory.) and the even more excessive territorial demands along the Black Sea coast made by a professor at the University of Georgia can be interpreted as diplomatic pressure exerted by Moscow to force Turkey to accept the Soviet Union's views on revising the</p>
<p>'Montreux Convention Regarding the Straits'</p>
<p>In any case, it is very clear that a kind of war of nerves is currently underway between the Soviet Union and Turkey, of which border demands are only a part. At the same time, the Transcaucasian territorial demands must be regarded as part of the general problem of the Middle East and related to other aspects of Soviet policy in this region, especially its desire for security on its back door.</p>
<p>As for the Straits issue, the revision of the 'Montreux Convention' should be decided jointly by all countries, and not just by the Soviet Union and Turkey themselves. But the Soviet Union is a powerful country, and it has at least some power to promote international cooperation. Now Turkey has to play a passive role. On this point, the Soviet Union argues that Turkey chose this passive role herself during the war, and that Turkey's neutrality was very beneficial to Germany. Turkey's neutrality was defended by President İnönü in a speech at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly on November 1, 1945, in which he emphasized that Turkey had rejected Germany's request to approach the Middle East and the Soviet Union's Caucasian border, and that Turkey had faithfully fulfilled the 'Montreux Convention'.</p>
<p>Ukraine suffered heavy losses in this war and cannot withstand foreign attacks. In order to ensure the security of its back door, the Soviet Union considers the</p>
<p>Old Foundation of Soviet-Turkish Relations</p>
<p>to be very unsatisfactory, so on March 19, 1945, it publicly criticized the 'Soviet-Turkish Treaty' signed in 1925. At that time, the Soviet Union issued a formal statement declaring, "The Soviet government recognizes the value of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty signed on December 17, 1925, in maintaining friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, but believes that we must pay attention to the fact that the current situation has changed greatly, especially during the Second World War. Therefore, this treaty is no longer suitable for the times and urgently needs to be fundamentally revised." During a meeting between the Soviet ambassador and the Turkish Foreign Minister in June, the Soviet government seemed to have proposed three preconditions for signing a new treaty: (1) Kars and Ardahan, which were ceded to Turkey in 1921, should be returned to the Soviet Union; (2) The Soviet Union should be allowed to establish bases in the Black Sea Straits and participate in the defense of the Straits; (3) The 'Montreux Convention' should be revised. In July, the Foreign Minister returned home from San Francisco, passing through London, and sent a memorandum to the British government and a copy to the US government, explaining Turkey's views. Turkey stated that as long as its sovereignty is not infringed and its security is not threatened, it is willing to guarantee the free passage of ships of all countries through the Straits under international supervision. At the same time, it expressed the hope that Soviet-Turkish relations should also be resolved together to avoid future disputes. President İnönü and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu both expressed their reactions to the territorial demands made by the Soviet Union in strong tones: "Turkish territory will never be allowed to be ceded to anyone; we were born in glory and will die in glory." President İnönü said this on November 1. Then, on January 6, Prime Minister Saraçoğlu cited recent historical records and population figures from Kars, Ardahan, and the Black Sea coast to refute the territorial demands made by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At the Potsdam Conference, a resolution was passed that the three powers should separately discuss the revision of the 'Montreux Convention' with the Turkish government. The United States (on November 2) and Great Britain (on November 23) subsequently proposed revisions to Turkey, but the British and American proposals did not include major changes. This topic was not formally discussed at the London Foreign Ministers Conference or the recent Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>If we observe with a long-term perspective, then the various political actions that occurred last year are difficult to explain according to current views, because due to the invention of atomic weapons, the true value of all classical</p>
<p>Strategic Fortresses</p>
<p>has been completely changed. The Soviet Union's actions can only remind people of 19th-century strategies.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's attention to the Straits can be traced back to the decline of the old Ottoman Empire and the expansion of Russian power towards the Black Sea. Before 1774, the Black Sea Straits were completely under the control of the old Ottoman Empire, but after the 'Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca' was signed in 1774, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great obtained a special permit from the Turkish side to allow Russian merchant ships to pass through the Straits. Since then, the authority of the old Ottoman Empire has been declining day by day. If it were not for the intervention of the Mediterranean and European countries (especially Great Britain), Russia could have obtained a special permit to allow warships to pass through the Straits into the Mediterranean Sea earlier. After Russia obtained this privilege, Western countries followed suit, imitating Russia and bullying the weak Turkey. Austria, Great Britain, France, and Prussia subsequently obtained special permits from Turkey, allowing their merchant ships to pass freely through the Straits. The Russo-Turkish War of 1829 ended with the signing of the 'Treaty of Adrianople', which recognized Russia's sovereignty over Georgia and the Caucasus provinces, and all neutral merchant ships were free to navigate the Black Sea and the Danube River.</p>
<p>Because the wheat-producing areas of southern Turkey became increasingly important, its Black Sea commerce also expanded accordingly, and the ports along the Black Sea coast were all ice-free ports, prompting Russia to intentionally establish a Black Sea fleet, which should have the right to freely pass through the Straits, but not allow other countries along the Black Sea coast to set foot in the Black Sea. By means of conquest, or by making the Turkish Emperor fall into a protected position, or by using peaceful means to allow the great powers to divide this declining old Ottoman Empire, Russia could thereby obtain control of Constantinople and place the Straits under Russian administration. These plans for territorial expansion were opposed by Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, and Germany, especially Great Britain, because the eastern Mediterranean was a lifeline for British-Indian communications and was of paramount importance to Great Britain. Therefore, Great Britain adopted a blockade policy, prohibiting all warships from passing through the Straits, and confining the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. Subsequently, Russia and Turkey resumed diplomatic relations and signed the 'Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi' in 1833, authorizing Russia to send warships through the Straits so that Russia could fulfill its mission to Turkey. Thereafter, according to the terms of the 'Quadruple Alliance of Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria' in 1840 (later France also joined in signing), foreign warships were again prohibited from passing through the Straits. Turkey at that time had no right to allow any national warships to pass through the Straits as an exception. Moreover, this prohibition could not be modified without the consent of the signatory countries. At this point, Russia recognized that</p>
<p>the Straits issue concerns all of Europe</p>
<p>and that the Russo-Turkish dispute is not just a matter between the two countries themselves. After Russia's defeat in the Crimean War, it was not allowed to build another fleet in the Black Sea, nor to establish munitions factories along the Black Sea coast, and was forced to cede Southern Bessarabia (Treaty of Paris in 1856). Tsar Alexander II was determined to break these shackles and took advantage of the Franco-Prussian War to first abolish the provisions concerning the Russian fleet. At the London Conference in 1871, the great powers agreed to abolish the veto power and guarantee the independence and integrity of Turkey. In order to achieve this goal, they authorized the Turkish Emperor to allow foreign warships to pass through the Straits, even in peacetime. As a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, Russia recovered the territory it had lost under the 'Treaty of Paris'.</p>
<p>At the same time, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 caused Great Britain's policy to begin to change, and then Great Britain acquired Cyprus in 1878 and obtained a strategic base in Egypt, so its policy became more active. The expansion of German power in Turkey and the Anglo-Russian alliance (1907) concluded due to changes in the European balance of power also forced Great Britain to change its policy. It now advocated that the Straits should be opened and that warships of all countries should be free to pass through the Straits. However, before 1918, the Straits were still under Turkish administration. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-1912, Russia</p>
<p>felt serious difficulties</p>
<p>because 50% of its maritime exports needed to pass through the Straits.</p>
<p>Similarly, during the Great War of 1914-1918, the closure of the Straits by Turkey caused Russia to lose contact with the Western Allies, which also resulted in considerable losses. In view of the impending crisis of military defeat, Great Britain and France expressed their understanding to Russia, and were willing to give it all the privileges that Russia had not been allowed to enjoy in the 19th century. Before the Dardanelles expedition began, Great Britain, France, and Russia secretly signed the 'Constantinople Agreement' on March 18, 1915, stipulating that if the Allies were victorious, Russia should occupy all of Constantinople, both sides of the Bosphorus, the line from Southern Thrace to Enos-Midia, Imbros, Tenedos, and certain islands in the Sea of Marmara. However, the Soviet leaders, after overthrowing the Kerensky Provisional Government, issued a formal declaration in October 1917, opposing all forms of annexation and imperialism, and rejecting all secret treaties signed by the Russian Emperors.</p>
<p>After Russia withdrew from the European War and Turkey collapsed, the administration of the Straits passed into the hands of the Allies. Allied troops occupied the strategic points along the Straits until 1923, when the Straits were placed under the jurisdiction of an international commission according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of Lausanne', and the armaments on the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles, and the islands in the Sea of Marmara were removed. Merchant ships were allowed to pass freely through the Straits, whether in peacetime or wartime. Warships could also pass through in peacetime, but the number of ships of any country was limited to no more than the Black Sea fleet. In a war in which Turkey was a belligerent, neutral warships and merchant ships would be responsible for their own safety when passing through the Straits. The Soviet representative attending the Lausanne Conference expressed his dissent when signing the treaty, and the Soviet government refused to ratify it. The Soviet Union argued that warships should not be allowed to pass through the Straits, whether in peacetime or wartime, but the Western countries wanted the Straits to be completely open. The result of the mediation was to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey together to jointly oppose the Western countries. The 'Soviet-Turkish Treaty' was signed on December 17, 1925, establishing a new friendship between the two countries (this treaty is the one that the Soviet Union recently repudiated). According to this treaty, neither country should take hostile action against the other if attacked by a third country.</p>
<p>The two countries agreed to maintain neutrality</p>
<p>In the following decade, the young Turkish Republic reached a consensus with the Western countries. In 1933, when Turkey felt confident of the support of itself and the Soviet Union, it dared to propose revising the 'Treaty of Lausanne'. It was not until 1936, when the League of Nations failed to effectively intervene in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict and Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland, that the Western countries recognized that the guarantees provided by the 'Treaty of Lausanne' were not sufficient and should not weaken Turkey's sovereignty over the Straits. Therefore, according to the 'Montreux Convention' signed on July 20, 1936, Turkey was able to rearm the Straits area, abolish the International Commission, and fully restore Turkish sovereignty. In peacetime, and in wars in which Turkey remained neutral, merchant ships of all countries were free to pass through the Straits; in peacetime, the movements of warships were restricted (which was entirely beneficial to the Soviet Union); and in wars in which Turkey remained neutral, warships of any belligerent country were not allowed to pass through the Straits.</p>
<p>The opinions of Great Britain and the United States are that, apart from the period in June 1944 during this recent war, when the Allies criticized Turkey for allowing German armed merchant ships to escape into the Aegean Sea through the Straits, Turkey can be said to have faithfully fulfilled all its responsibilities under the 'Montreux Convention'. The Soviet Union does not agree with this view, believing that Turkey's neutrality was beneficial to Germany. Great Britain and the United States seem to believe that the 'Montreux Convention' only needs to be adapted to the new era and linked to new international institutions, and that its specific provisions should be slightly revised to conform to new naval technology, which is enough. The Soviet Union believes that its entire foundation (that is, Turkey's complete sovereignty over the Straits) should be changed. The general opinion in Great Britain today is that the 'Montreux Convention' is good enough in peacetime, and that any agreement is useless in wartime, so the most important thing is to prevent war. This seems a bit like empty talk to the Soviet Union, because its borders have proven to be weak and unreliable in the past, and it is stubbornly</p>
<p>seeking border security</p>
<p>Turkey's opinion on the issue of weakening its sovereignty has already been mentioned earlier. According to the 'Tripartite Treaty' signed on October 19, 1939 (valid for 15 years), Great Britain and France should both bear certain responsibilities for Turkey. From this brief description of the history of the Straits issue, we can see that the current situation is not a new event at all, and its origins have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>The Transcaucasian border issue has played a relatively minor role in the past, although this dispute has a history of more than 70 years between the Soviet Union and Turkey. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of San Stefano', Turkey should cede the provinces of Ardahan, Kars, Batum, and Bayazid to Russia. However, after the intervention of the great powers, the 'Treaty of Berlin' replaced the 'Treaty of San Stefano', returning Bayazid to Turkey, but recognizing the cession of Batum, Kars, and Ardahan in place of the huge indemnity that Turkey was unable to pay. This transfer of territory did not pose a problem, whether based on ethnological arguments or according to the wishes of the local residents. Subsequently, according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of Brest-Litovsk' in 1918, this territory was re-ceded to Turkey, but the current border was not finally determined until 1921. During this period, the Allies, relying on their control of the Straits, used the provinces of Georgia, Yerevan, and Azerbaijan, which were attempting to become independent, to form a cordon sanitaire (a blockade line to prevent infectious diseases) between the Soviet Union and Turkey, which eventually led to the resumption of Soviet-Turkish relations mentioned above. The Transcaucasus seemed to the Western countries to be a remote place, not worth their continued investment of manpower and material resources there after the end of the war. Therefore, the British troops stationed there withdrew in August 1919. At the same time, the interior of the Transcaucasian Republics failed to unify. Thus,</p>
<p>the Soviet Union was given an opportunity</p>
<p>Azerbaijan declared itself a Soviet Republic in early 1920. The Armenian Republic of Yerevan, attacked by both Turkey and Russia, had to request a ceasefire on November 7, and then, in mid-December, a Soviet government was established. Turkey, which had occupied Kars (an Armenian fortress) during the war, demanded that about three-quarters of the territory in that area on the Russian border before the Great War of 1914 be ceded to Turkey, but this demand was not accepted.</p>
<p>Georgia, which maintained a strong tradition of national independence, continued to resist attacks from the Soviet Union and Turkey after its neighbors succumbed, but in 1921, under strong Soviet pressure, the Georgian Soviet Republic was finally declared, and the Turkish military responded by withdrawing. During this chaotic period, the territory of the Transcaucasus changed hands frequently, and the final solution was reached in Moscow in March 1921, when the Soviet Union and Turkey signed a treaty stipulating that Batum and the 'Batum-Baku oil pipeline' at the Black Sea end should belong to the Soviet Union, but Turkey would have unrestricted use of the port, while Kars and Ardahan should be returned to Turkey.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the Transcaucasus during this period, we must mention Armenia's attempt at independence, which the Allies encouraged during the war and at the peace conference. President Wilson made his famous 'Fourteen Points' speech on January 8, 1918, which included the following statement: "...the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development..." In April 1920, Armenia was entrusted to the United States for trusteeship, but the United States refused to accept it. The 'Treaty of Sèvres' signed by Turkey and the Allies was invalidated because it was not ratified. According to this treaty, Turkey should recognize Armenia as a free and independent country, and its borders should be delineated according to President Wilson's ruling in November 1920. The Allies did not fulfill their promises to Armenia. Therefore, a group of Armenians residing in London took this as an excuse, calling themselves the Armenian Socialist Party, and wrote to the London Foreign Ministers Conference in October 1945, declaring: "The Armenians of the world are absolutely united in demanding the implementation of President Wilson's ruling, and they firmly hope that if the Soviet Union demands that</p>
<p>the Armenian provinces of Turkey</p>
<p>be incorporated into the boundaries of Soviet Armenia, the British and American governments should take consistent action with the Soviet government."</p>
<p>Regarding the ethnological basis for the Soviet Union's territorial demands, Turkey's interpretation is that, broadly speaking, this basis no longer exists today. This view is supported by evidence provided by impartial observers. At the same time, the Soviet Union has never demanded the territory of Kars and Ardahan on ethnological grounds, and the population of Soviet Armenia, in terms of its relative density, is not excessively crowded, which are two facts that are worth mentioning here.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the Soviet Union's territorial demands on the Transcaucasus are merely a byproduct of the Black Sea Straits issue, which has been proven by historical facts. At the same time, the recent events in Iranian Azerbaijan province have further aggravated the situation, affecting not only Turkey, but also the future of the entire Middle East.

<h3>Glimpses of the U.S. Women's Army Corps</h3>
<p>An American girl of Polish descent (left), dressed in Polish national costume, is raising her hand to swear allegiance to a unit within the U.S. Women's Army Corps. This unit is composed entirely of American women of Polish descent. Standing to the right is a lieutenant of the Army Corps, supervising the oath. Behind them is the Liberty Bell, a historical symbol of American freedom. Among the women enlisting are a world-renowned opera star and a young woman. They had just escaped from German concentration camps after eighteen months of captivity and enlisted ten days after returning to the United States. The purpose of the U.S. Women's Army Corps and other non-combatant units is to enable American women to perform the duties of men, allowing them to take on combat roles. The war services performed by the Women's Army Corps include medical affairs, training, science, photography, languages, weather reporting, radio, transportation, mechanics, administrative work, driving vehicles, military supplies, and other war services, numbering no fewer than two hundred and thirty-nine types. Their footprints can be found in the European and Pacific theaters of war.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: Rampant Extortion and Levies - People of Eastern Zhejiang Unable to Bear the Burden</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>After eight years of resistance against Japan, and upon the arrival of victory, the government, in the midst of post-war recovery, urgently needs to address the people's pressing demands for a stable and improved life. This cannot be treated as a matter for later consideration. Therefore, the first good news the government conveyed to the people after the victory was the exemption of farmland tax for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) in all recovered areas nationwide. Indeed, during eight years of darkness, the people suffered oppression under the enemy and puppets, living a life of servitude. Now that the homeland has been restored, the government orders the exemption of farmland tax, allowing the people to recover slightly. This is truly an act of profound grace! Who would have thought that the central government's good policy would have the opposite effect. Policies originate from multiple sources, with no fixed amount for levies. These levies are not collected together with the farmland tax (since the farmland tax for the 34th year was exempted, it cannot be collected together), nor are they managed uniformly by the government (because the donations are as numerous as hairs on an ox, urgent like a shooting star, and it seems provincial and county governments do not have time to tally them, making unified management impossible). Instead, the task is entrusted to the easily corruptible rural townships and baojia systems for house-to-house conscription, with no one spared. Now, this practice has become even more severe, with no restrictions imposed. Those who have not conducted on-site investigations might suspect this is an exaggeration. Now, I will use my recent return to my hometown of Yuyao in Zhejiang Province, which I had left for ten years due to my father's passing, as an example.</p>
<p>According to the elders in my village, in August and September of last year (1945), when the news of victory spread throughout Zhejiang Province, Yuyao launched a donation campaign throughout the county for "Celebration of Victory in the War of Resistance" (the first type of donation after the victory). At this time, the people, suddenly seeing the light of day, were filled with joy and eagerly welcomed the occasion, and a large sum of money was quickly raised without needing to force donations. However, after that, in addition to regular taxes such as business tax and slaughter tax, various miscellaneous and exorbitant levies surged like a tide, one after another. To date, according to the memories of the villagers, in the short span of six months, there have been as many as twelve types of donations. The main ones are as follows: (1) Fees for civilian laborers requisitioned by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Agency; (2) Supply fees for garrison troops; (3) Expenses for purchasing firearms; (4) Expenses for the liaison intelligence network; (5) Military grain; (6) Public grain; (7) Non-staple food and clothing expenses for the county militia; (8) Equipment expenses for the district administrative office; (9) Recurring expenses for national schools; (10) Village housing and police donation fees; (11) Expenses for the farmers' association; (12) Construction fees for the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Such exorbitant levies are piled upon each other, emerging endlessly. Each time they are collected, it is either by order of the province or county, then by the county to the township, the township to the bao, and the bao to the jia, who then collect rice and currency from door to door from both landlords and tenants, with amounts determined arbitrarily without any standard. And unscrupulous baojia heads take advantage to embezzle, which is unavoidable. Taking a rough estimate, for every one unit of official revenue received by the government, the people pay double or even triple, making the burden unbearable. As a result, the people live in constant anxiety, fearing the arrival of the official documents in the hands of the baojia heads and the wooden holsters on the waists of the self-defense forces (armed self-defense forces are often dispatched during collection), looming over their humble homes, causing them to tremble with fear and shed tears in silence. Usually, the government collects farmland tax only once or twice a year, but these levies are so exorbitant and numerous, coming endlessly and incessantly. People say, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger," but in reality, it is like draining the pond to catch all the fish, even fiercer than a tiger. People say, "Miscellaneous levies are as bothersome as flies," but in reality, they arrive morning and evening, even more bothersome than flies. Thus, the government nominally implements the benevolent policy of "exemption of farmland tax," but the people actually suffer the oppressive government of "exhausting all resources." The people are not dying from tigers, bandits, the enemy, or the puppets, but from the government that led the War of Resistance to success. What could be more resentful than this!</p>
<p>What is even more incomprehensible is that our Chairman, through perseverance and extraordinary leadership, led the War of Resistance for eight years as if it were a single day. His indelible achievements shine brightly both at home and abroad, and will be remembered for thousands of years. The people, wanting to commemorate him, all share the same sentiment! Now, the Zhejiang provincial authorities are building a "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" for the Chairman as a means of commemoration. This is precisely what the people wish would be "planned and built and completed without delay" in this peaceful and prosperous time. However, at a time when the land is scarred and the people are on the verge of death, Yuyao County is actually levying a "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall construction fee" of as much as three million yuan. The county magistrate, unable to raise the funds, then orders the township heads, who then order the baojia heads. The baojia heads then forcibly collect from door to door, just as disruptively as other miscellaneous levies. The people believe that this hall is to commemorate the Chairman's great achievements, so even if they are unable to afford it, they will pawn their possessions and borrow money, enduring hunger and cold to comply. However, one wonders why the Zhejiang provincial authorities do not emulate the Chairman's heart of "treating the people as if they were wounded," and instead build this historically valuable hall on the groans of the people? I know that the great Chairman would certainly not bear to hear and happily accept it, and I believe the Zhejiang provincial authorities will also realize their mistake and withdraw from this course.</p>
<p>The above is all based on objective facts, without a single element of emotional bias. I deeply hope that the government authorities, understanding the suffering of our people, will not increase it further, and will resolutely stop collecting various exorbitant levies, so as not to further disturb our people. According to the majority opinion of the village elders, they would rather endure the pain for a while and pay the farmland tax for the 35th year of the Republic (1946) in advance (the farmland tax for the 35th year is normally collected in September of this year), and have all miscellaneous levies collected together with the farmland tax, to be collected and remitted uniformly by the county government, without entrusting the baojia with collecting even a single cent, thus preventing corruption and eliminating disturbances, so that the common people can still find peace under heavy burdens. Otherwise, the impact will not only be the weeping of a single family or a single road, it will be enough to shatter the fruits of victory and place the nation in a state of eternal destruction. Fearing the dangers, I dare not remain silent. I think that your esteemed newspaper holds a fair position and serves as the voice of the people. I beg you to lend me a corner of your space to publish this and to appeal to the government to quickly devise a comprehensive remedy, so as to relieve the people from their distress, rescue them from fire and water, and plead for their lives with utmost sincerity. May they take this into consideration. (Zhang Yiju, March 11th)</p>
<h3>Request to the Financial Authorities to Clarify the National Bond Policy</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have always been a believer in public bonds and am a small player in the bond industry. Currently, my colleagues in the bond industry feel particularly distressed about the current situation of public bonds, and there are many doubts that urgently need clarification from the financial authorities to dispel public confusion. As your newspaper has always been the voice of the people, I boldly, in the capacity of a commoner, dare to ask your newspaper to publish this, so that I may obtain guidance from wise people in all sectors and obtain clear instructions from the authorities. I list the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the impact of the war, currency inflation, and the depreciation of currency value, the face value of public bonds is already less than one-thousandth of its original value at the time of issuance. According to its current market price, it has exceeded its face value by fifteen times. Why is it that the financial authorities turn a blind eye? Moreover, in the report on financial matters made by Finance Minister Yu at the recent Second Plenary Session, not a single word was mentioned about public bonds. Are public bonds an unimportant matter?</p>
<p>(2) The current market price of National Salvation Bonds is slightly higher than that of the Unified B Bonds. Since the National Government moved west due to the war, this bond has been like a worthless security. Now that victory has arrived, we only hear about the lottery drawing for the principal and interest payment of U.S. dollar and British pound bonds, but there is no news at all about these National Salvation Bonds. Is it because their face value is too small when calculated at the current face value? However, the legal tender paid at the beginning when buying bonds out of patriotism had a very different value from the current value. I ask, are there any countries in the world where those who buy national salvation bonds receive such a poor outcome after their country's victory?</p>
<p>(3) The market price of public bonds is high because the financial authorities have made no statement or paid any interest, which has further caused the public to believe that the government will definitely maintain its creditworthiness and will not cause bondholders to suffer any losses. As a result, the market price is slightly higher. The Unified B Bonds once reached twenty-four times their face value at its highest, which seems extremely pitiful compared to the soaring prices of goods and stocks. However, public opinion from all walks of life has repeatedly criticized this, regarding it as speculation. Are there no people with a sense of justice among these critics? I ask, for public bonds issued by the same country, is it that those denominated in foreign currency can avoid losses, while those denominated in the local currency should suffer? Who would then believe in or invest in bonds denominated in the local currency in the future?</p>
<p>(4) The above leads to a related question, that is, the numerous officials of the government deliberate day and night on how to contract the currency, but why do they forget to drive funds into investing in public bonds? Is the country worried about issuing new public bonds?</p>
<p>(5) Public bonds are securities with value and are explicitly stipulated as being freely tradable. Why has the police station recently been arbitrarily arresting public bond dealers or hindering their freedom of trade? Last week, my colleague Mr. Li was detained by the police station and held for three hours, after which he had to leave a fingerprint to be released. Has the public bond regulation stipulating free trade been canceled and invalidated? However, no clear cancellation has been announced by the financial authorities. I dare to ask, "What is the mystery behind this?"</p>
<p>(6) According to Mr. Li, he has been in this business for more than ten years, and he believes in the country throughout his life. He was also detained for dealing in public bonds during the enemy-puppet era. He never expected to see this situation again after the restoration of light. In his anger, he regrets not having been one of those who bought gold, stored foreign exchange, and hoarded goods, who are now triumphant and satisfied. This "Mr. Li's new conclusion" may seem insignificant on the surface, but it is actually a matter of concern. I ask, do clear-sighted people need to or know how to salvage this kind of distorted mentality?</p>
<p>Although the above items are very plain, in Shanghai, the financial center of the country, they must be mentioned, because their impact is not small. I hope that wise people from all walks of life, as well as wise authorities, will quickly provide guidance. Shi Jiahao (March 5th)</p>
<h3>A Record of Torture on the Tongguan-Luoyang Road</h3>
<p>— Fan Hongji</p>
<p>Luoyang, this newspaper, 23rd dispatch</p>
<p>After staying in Tongguan for two or three days, due to various difficulties, I almost changed my plan to travel east along the Longhai Railway. I had once negotiated with the Jin-Cha-Sui-Ji Branch Office to go to Taiyuan with a large number of staff from the office and then try to transfer to Beiping. However, as many friends had entrusted me with matters that I had to try to accomplish, and my hometown was far away and my parents had been waiting for a long time, I had to take the opportunity to return. Fortunately, Director Zhou of the Joint Transportation Office went to Tongguan to inspect, which resolved the difficulty of traveling east. On the morning of the 21st, I boarded a Longhai Joint Transportation vehicle and left Tongguan.</p>
<p>As soon as the vehicle started, dust rose into the air. Sitting at the back of the vehicle, looking back, the rising dust looked like cumulus clouds in summer, or like the spray of a waterfall hitting rocks, surging and turbulent. If it weren't for the dust entering my nose, I wouldn't know I was on the Loess Plateau.</p>
<p>We hadn't gone far when, after a turn and a steep slope, the vehicle, even with full power, couldn't make it up. As a result, the people in the back had to get out and push.</p>
<p>Leaving the First Pass - Stepping onto the Line of Life and Death</p>
<p>After leaving the First Pass (the border between Henan and Shaanxi), I overlooked the railway emerging from the mountain tunnel. This area was the most threatened section during the war, having endured countless enemy shells, and countless locomotives and passengers had lost their lives here. The dirt road we were traveling on was the old cart path from before the railway was built in the late Qing dynasty. The road surface was entirely made up of cart tracks. After the War of Resistance, the Shaanxi-Henan road was cut off, and this road became the only thoroughfare between the two provinces. I really did not expect that the so-called repatriation vehicles would take this narrow, winding, steep, and sloping dirt road, rather than the original Luoyang-Tongguan highway. Even more strange, the road was not repaired at all. Paving stones and building bridges would certainly take too long, but it didn't seem too difficult to pay attention to uneven road surfaces or excessively steep slopes and turns. Disregarding the vehicle's lifespan, the safety of returning passengers, and the passengers' health is truly disheartening. Anyone who sees this road shakes their head and sighs: "It's terrible!" I heard that when it rains, it takes ten or eight days to travel the road, so some people simply spend a few extra days on the road and take a "lala car," which is a little less dangerous.</p>
<p>Overturning Tragedy - Luggage Everywhere</p>
<p>When our vehicle reached a certain location, a vehicle that was traveling ahead of us overturned on the side of the road. Many of the passengers had broken heads and were bleeding. Some were sitting, some were lying, some were shouting. Luggage was scattered all over the ground. The reason for the overturning was: the road was too narrow, and the roadside was too soft. When an oncoming vehicle approached, the vehicle gave way, and slipped into the field. Our vehicle also drove to the edge of the field when turning a corner, but fortunately the driver was quick to react and immediately stopped the vehicle. He called the passengers to get off and quickly pulled the vehicle back up, otherwise there would have been at least some bloodshed, if not fatal injuries.</p>
<p>What we hadn't anticipated was the painful experience of riding in a vehicle, regardless of size, that was forced to carry more than thirty people. The vehicle was full of luggage, with nearly forty adults and children. Because of the lack of transportation, the thirty people registered for each vehicle had to be accommodated. As a result, we had to squeeze desperately, grabbing whatever foothold we could find. The station sent this group of passengers onto the vehicle.</p>
<p>Tense Situation - Experiencing the Bitter Taste of Squeezing</p>
<p>The squeezing situation was no less severe than the evacuation on the Xiang-Gui Railway the year before. Those sitting on the edge, traveling on the bumpy, winding, and sloping road, feared being thrown under the vehicle and had to squeeze inward as much as possible to maintain their safety. Those sitting inside had to bear the weight of many people stepping on their legs and shoulders. The upper body was burdened, and the lower body couldn't move. Their buttocks couldn't sit properly on the seat, and the vehicle's movement prevented them from supporting their bodies with their hands. But this suffering from being squeezed and dragged had to be endured every minute and every second, so the entire vehicle was never quiet for a minute. Either someone was complaining that their legs couldn't stretch out, or someone was shouting that the people on either side were encroaching on their space and knocking over their child. The situation was tense and heated like a raging fire. I also tasted the flavors of inside, outside, front, and back, which I had never experienced before, so I said, "On the Tongguan-Luoyang road, one suffers torture!"</p>
<p>After noon, the sun shone directly on the ground, and the dust flew even more fiercely. People's breathing was extremely labored. Most people didn't want to eat lunch, feeling hot and restless, and unable to eat anything. By the afternoon, our bodies were completely coated with a layer of yellow earth, about two or three copper coins thick. Our noses, mouths, eyes, and ears were all sealed with yellow earth, and we were completely transformed into "earth people."</p>
<p>Vehicle Arrives at Shaanxi Prefecture - Situation Becomes Even More Chaotic</p>
<p>There were very few inspections along the way. There were two or three checkpoints, but as soon as the vehicle stopped, it was registered and let through, with no other troubles. On the first night, we arrived at Shaanxi Prefecture, 111 kilometers from Tongguan. Getting on and off the vehicle was completely unsupervised. Passengers had to retrieve, place, and guard their own luggage. Seating was no longer assigned, and passengers had to find their own seats, making the situation even more chaotic than before.</p>
<p>Things in Shaanxi Prefecture were similar to those in Tongguan. Lodgings cost 360 yuan per day, tea was 80 yuan, and tips were optional. Meals cost around 500 yuan per meal. The lodgings were still "fully booked," so finding a lodging was a major task when the vehicle arrived at the station, unlike before the war when many lodgings sent people to the station to compete for customers.</p>
<p>From Shaanxi Prefecture to Luoyang is a total of 150 kilometers, and there are many vehicles. Every night, drivers go to the lodgings to ask the bosses, "Is there a good vehicle going to Luoyang?" Under this situation, the vehicles are looking for people, and the passengers can take advantage, which means they can bargain. Usually, the price can be negotiated for several thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Rotten Roads, Broken Vehicles - How Can This Benefit Repatriation?</p>
<p>On the second day, we passed through Zhangmao, Guanyintang, Hua Chi, Tiemen, and Xin'an. Prices were relatively low, and vendors shouted as the vehicle passed through the streets.</p>
<p>The vehicle's tires were flat on the road, and we waited for another hour. Fortunately, we managed to reach Luoyang City that night. According to the driver, none of their vehicles are in good condition. Each trip requires two or three days of repairs, followed by one or two days of rest. At most, they can only make three trips per month. In this urgent repatriation effort, traveling just over 1,000 li per month on this short 261-kilometer journey is simply not urgent enough and is disappointing to outsiders. Why are the roads not repaired? Why are good vehicles not used? How can dealing with this with rotten roads and broken vehicles be called repatriation transportation? (February 23rd in Luoyang)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Starting with "Chang'e Flying to the Moon"</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>That was last year's affair.</p>
<p>In the silvery-blue sky hung a silver-white moon, it was precisely the Mid-Autumn Festival evening for family reunion.</p>
<p>With a gust of wind, there was a whiff of osmanthus fragrance in the courtyard.</p>
<p>"Oh! The bright moon is in the sky, the ice wheel emerges, what a beautiful scene of clear autumn..." Wei Luo, who had just learned Peking Opera for more than two months, couldn't leave her "profession" in three sentences.</p>
<p>"From morning till night, crowing like a chicken or meowing like a cat, how hateful and detestable," that was Jie Na, who became "heroically short of breath" after learning for eight days, getting angry whenever opera was mentioned.</p>
<p>"What do you know?" Wei Luo said, "This is called 'evoking feelings by the scene'!"</p>
<p>"What do you know?" Jie Na retorted, "Even after learning for three and a half days, I know these sentences are from 'Farewell My Concubine'. If you want to evoke feelings by the scene, why don't you sing 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon'? Why hum that?"</p>
<p>"'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', I haven't learned it yet!"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at that.</p>
<p>So the topic turned to Chang'e—</p>
<p>Qing Zi gazed at the bright moon, thoughtfully saying, "The scientists' theories are really a killjoy, so many beautiful fairy tales! I've yearned for it since I was little, that touching fairy tale 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', but those people insist on saying that the moon is a satellite of the solar system, and something about glaciers... a whole bunch of theories, making it all boring."</p>
<p>What a poetic idea!</p>
<p>"The scientists deserve to die ten thousand times, Your Majesty, please calm your anger," the playful Wei Luo came to "evoke feelings by the scene."</p>
<p>Another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>"I also agree with Qing Zi's words, if we had this set of scientific theories a few thousand years ago, we might not have been able to read so many good poems and essays," Xuan Zhu said.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right?" Jie Na laughed, "In that case, even if Wei Luo learns opera for another ten years, she probably wouldn't learn 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon'."</p>
<p>"Well! It doesn't matter if there's no 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', let's use 'Farewell My Concubine' as a substitute," Wei Luo said solemnly, "But aren't the poems of the ancients mostly praising nature? In ten poems that mention the moon," she added with the frankness of "Fourth Son Visiting His Mother", "eight or nine of them do."</p>
<p>"You're exaggerating too much," Jie Na said, "The scientists didn't say there's no moon in the sky, what are you worried about?"</p>
<p>"This—" Wei Luo glared at her, "Why are you deliberately making trouble for me today?" She thought for a moment and exclaimed, "Got it, at least there's one poem, Li Shangyin's 'Chang'e Should Regret Stealing the Immortality Elixir'," wouldn't it be impossible to write?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of this poem," Xin Shi asked, "What kind of person do you imagine Chang'e to be?"</p>
<p>"Like Wang Qiang reborn, her face like Xishi reincarnated." The wicked Wei Luo, again quoted two lines from a seven-character verse narrative.</p>
<p>"Incorrect, at the time of Chang'e, Xishi and Tu Jiao hadn't even been born yet! How could they 'reborn' or 'reincarnate'?" Xuan Zhu said, "Chang'e is the goddess of the moon, as beautiful as peach blossoms and plums, as cold as ice and frost."</p>
<p>"Cold as ice and frost is just an external attitude, Chang'e is a passionate woman," Jie Na said definitely.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Otherwise, why would she 'regret stealing the immortality elixir'? And why would she have a 'blue sea, blue sky, night after night heart'?"</p>
<p>"Actually, Chang'e is too infatuated, is someone like Hou Yi worth missing? Women are really pitiful, even Chang'e is no exception," Xuan Zhu sighed, with a bit of subtext.</p>
<p>"You're really a bunch of bookworms," Wei Luo laughed, like silver bells, "That's just the poet's nonsense, you've all fallen for Li Shangyin's trick! Imagine Chang'e sitting in the Guanghan Palace, how carefree, how free, seeing through the vicissitudes of the human world, surprised by the phoenix anchoring, sadness and joy, separation and reunion, all are illusions, why would she still miss Hou Yi? Why would she still miss that—"</p>
<p>"Listening to her, quickly get paper and pen, what a beautiful thesis?" It was Jie Na again, who was looking for trouble, interrupting her.</p>
<p>"Maybe she still has a child left behind, even if she doesn't miss Hou Yi, she will still miss her child." Xuan Zhu's weak voice, this sentence was not heard by everyone.</p>
<p>"Mommy, what are you talking about?" Sen Sen. Jie Na's nine-year-old son ran over and asked.</p>
<p>"Sen Sen, we're talking about the story of Chang'e in the moon."</p>
<p>"There's Wu Gang in the moon, Teacher Li told us yesterday, Wu Gang chopping cassia tree."</p>
<p>"Really, there's also Mr. Wu Gang in the moon! Luckily this child mentioned it," Jie Na said, "We almost forgot about him."</p>
<p>"In that case, Chang'e also has a companion, and will no longer have a 'blue sea, blue sky, night after night heart'," Wei Luo laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Why is it that today you haven't said a word, haven't expressed a single brilliant idea?" Qing Zi asked me.</p>
<p>I smiled and did not answer her question. Originally, I have never been clear about such big issues as women's issues, and they are discussing Chang'e flying to the moon like Nora leaving home, what else can I say?</p>
<p>March 8, 1946</p>
<h3>The Old Man</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qun</p>
<p>My sixth uncle's situation is quite miserable. He is a burden to live. He had been prominent for a while in his early years, but that is a thing of the past. Now no one pays attention to him anymore. Relatives and friends all try to stay away from him. People dislike his garrulousness and his words are out of touch with the times. Even his wife, his daughter-in-law, and his grandchildren can arbitrarily abuse him, as if his existence is really superfluous.</p>
<p>However, let me say, sixth uncle is really a kind-hearted old man. He is honest and sincere, treats others as he treats himself, and can treat his nephews and nieces equally. In the past, his feelings with my father were as close as glue. The degree of their friendship was really unimaginable. They lived and ate together. When my father passed away, he was really sad for a while. In the past, he could have someone to chat with, but now his old partner has also left him far away.</p>
<p>My sixth uncle is already over seventy years old, but he doesn't look very frail. Naturally, the dragon-like old age of ordinary old people is inevitable. He is in good health and rarely has minor problems throughout the year. He is used to doing housework, like sweeping spider webs and playing with flowers and plants, it seems that he cannot pass the time without doing this. People say that perhaps his labor is very helpful to his body. Once, he suddenly had diarrhea in the middle of the night, and the diarrhea was very severe, totaling twenty or thirty times. His family was really scared for a while, but the next day he was completely fine, sweeping spider webs and playing with flowers and plants as usual, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>My sixth uncle left his hometown very early. His situation was quite poor when he was young. Even now, he still likes to talk endlessly about the tight circumstances of those years, such as going to Nanjing to take the imperial examination and selling his fur coat to survive the winter. He likes to talk about that very much. He feels that this is the best lesson for his descendants. The reason why our family is in this situation is that the achievements of the deceased uncle cannot be erased. He has done many things before, worked as a teacher in a normal school, worked as an editor-in-chief in a newspaper, and also served as a factory director. After the age of forty, he suffered a serious illness, almost leaving the world. Although he recovered from the illness later, his mind became confused. He couldn't remember things from the day before, and he wouldn't even recognize relatives in the family if he didn't see them for a few days. For this reason, he often made some jokes, but he remembered things before the illness very clearly. He could even recite entire paragraphs of ancient books. Some people say that this is his blessing, and he also boasts that he has entered the realm of a half-immortal. He said that his eating and sleeping are both supernatural, he can eat or not eat, and he doesn't feel hungry even if he doesn't eat anything all day long. He loves Zheng Banqiao's sentence the most, "It is rare to be confused." He said that there are very few people who have entered his realm in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Because of his confusion, he has been living a reclusive life for many years. The business he founded was messed up by his nephews. Occasionally, people told him something, and he was very angry. He was not very confident in the various despicable methods of his nephews. But then he forgot completely. What is most ridiculous is that our family's situation has gradually declined in recent years, and the old servants of the past have dispersed, but he still likes to shout loudly sometimes, and others laugh at him. He likes to play a little mahjong, but people generally don't want to accompany him. A few granddaughters sometimes play four rounds with him when they are in a good mood. He sometimes argues about a card like a child, and his face turns red. He is completely indifferent to the price changes in recent years. The Japanese came and went, and he didn't know at all. In his memory, he thought that life was still as good as before, and that rice was sold for ten yuan a dan, so cheap. Once people told him that eggs were already selling for ten thousand, and his surprise was indescribable. He said that he was determined not to eat anymore, but naturally that was just talk. Ten minutes later, he had already forgotten what he had said.</p>
<h3>The Sound of the Watchman's Drum</h3>
<p>— Suo Yi</p>
<p>Friend, can you hear the sound of the watchman's drum in this noisy city?</p>
<p>Midnight, in the silent darkness; friend, listen to the sound of the watchman's drum, monotonous and desolate, spreading faintly from the alley.</p>
<p>If you lean out, you can see a thin shadow reflected in the cold moonlight, holding a wind lantern, mechanically knocking on bamboo clappers, approaching from afar.</p>
<p>In this dark world, no one accompanies him, spending this long night. The most intimate is this wind lantern. In the monotonous sound of the watchman's drum, he walks through the streets and alleys, completing his responsibility for this day.</p>
<p>That sound of the watchman's drum is like a monk in an ancient temple, striking the bell, emitting that kind of desolate sound wave, cleansing your long-turbid heart.</p>
<h3>Scroll of Poems on a Journey to Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Jianfang Yi Mei of Southern Anhui was a classmate twenty years ago. We have not seen each other for fifteen years! Before the Incident, correspondence was uninterrupted. In the spring of the twenty-fifth year, the Ministry of Education held the Second National Art Exhibition in Beijing. I had some works participating. Yi Mei and I both went to Beijing to visit, but we did not meet because of the different travel dates. She wrote in her letter: Your landscape painting is refreshing and pleasing, etc. I was grateful for her discerning words, so I presented it to her as a gift. Soon after, she reciprocated with a self-made "Scroll of Poems on a Journey to Huangshan," which was about two feet long and six inches high, made of white silk satin and embroidered with blue poems and calligraphy. It was exquisitely beautiful and could be called a triple masterpiece of poetry, calligraphy, and embroidery. The poem reads: "A corner of a dangerous building is idle on the ridge, the west window does not need to be closed in the evening; it is good to point to the setting sun descending from the distant mountains outside the vast clouds and trees." It is timeless and extraordinary, and the calligraphy is also graceful and dynamic, unlike a woman's handwriting. I carefully treasure it, and ten years have passed in an instant. Every time I think of her, we are on opposite sides of the earth, and my heart aches when I unroll the scroll. So I followed up with two quatrains:</p>
<p>Wandering in scenic spots is leisurely, cloud</p>
<p>things, layered buildings are not allowed to</p>
<p>close; every word is a pearl, made by your hand,</p>
<p>facing you, desks, smoke and clouds are leisurely all day long.</p>
<p>Heavenly sounds in mid-air, how could they</p>
<p>be closed? You gave me a brocade embroidered</p>
<p>scroll of poetry and calligraphy, it is as if</p>
<p>a piece of mountain has flown here.</p>
<h3>Leaving the Hague</h3>
<p>— Jin Wensi</p>
<p>The caged cart turns repeatedly, setting off at dawn, the wind-driven vehicle is about to depart, overwhelmed with emotion; roundly urging the wind wheel of the water country to turn, I remember the green of the rice fields in my Jiangnan hometown. Seven years finally made me an exile from Qin, I am still ashamed to be a Han Su Xiang in my prime; at this time of danger, I am most happy that my parents are healthy, I miss my brothers in Shanghai and Paris.</p>
<h3>Responding to the Previous Rhyme Leaving Brussels</h3>
<p>— Qian Tai</p>
<p>The fierce power of the border guards prohibits guests from traveling, wandering on the blocked road, feeling lost; a hungry stomach rumbles, facing the wind and cold, frequent night alarms, fearing the bright moon. In both places, we know that we cherish our close friends, and we have troubled Jing Ke many times to avoid disasters; the return journey is thousands of miles away, obstructed by the voyage, let's report peace to our brothers.</p>
<h3>Leaving Poland, Taking the Road to Belgium and France, Responding to the Previous Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingqi (Deceased)</p>
<p>My homeland is broken and the road is difficult to travel, millions of people flee in misery; (The righteous battle is not seen in the Spring and Autumn Annals, who knows the game of Weiqi in the Chu-Han chess game. Yellow sand is blue and I mourn the previous lessons, the black night carriages move with the wandering guests; it is miserable to have no success and only dry bones, the father mourns his son and the younger brother mourns his older brother.</p>
<h3>Leaving Paris, Responding to the Previous Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhaoji</p>
<p>A hundred twists and turns in the dark night, refugees everywhere, a scene of misery; the wind blows the wheels of the vehicle, questioning the alarm, the moon reflects the desolate wilderness, half-bright in color. After eight years of drifting, I finally realize it was a dream, with multiple disasters everywhere, I miss my lord even more; I still hope that the weapons of war will be destroyed one day, and all people in the world will be brothers.</p>
<h3>Using My Younger Brother's Rhyme of Saying Farewell to the Hague and Missing Friends in Europe</h3>
<p>— Jin Wenzhu</p>
<p>The rumbling of the cart goes in all directions, the lingering feelings for the homeland are endless, the wind and rain almost seem to form chaos, the rivers and mountains still shine brightly. The raging waves compete for the position of leader, lodging in autumn sorrow, writing poems as a guest minister; bitterness and sweetness are shared, I know from afar that you also miss me as a brother.</p>
<h3>Double Stay Double Fly (19)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Several months ago, the Weixin Grand Stage invited a group of famous actors from Hankou to perform Peking Opera. As a result, the idle class men and women of the entire Jingzhou went crazy, including Second Madam Weng and Madam Mo. Second Madam Weng was simply fascinated by Shi Yuqi, who sang female roles, while Madam Mo was simply fascinated by the opera. Second Madam Weng almost secured a box, and went to support the show with Madam Mo every day, unless there was no Shi Yulou's opera on that day.</p>
<p>Second Madam Weng originally liked Peking Opera because of her own interests and knew how to sing a few lines. At first, Second Madam Weng only admired Shi Yulou's acting skills on the stage, but later she fell in love with Shi Yulou the person offstage. At first, she just went to listen to the opera every day, but later, Second Madam Weng actually sent colorful silk to Shi Yulou to support the show. It was on this day that Second Madam Weng and Shi Yulou officially met. Although it was a brief meeting—Shi Yulou received the colorful silk, and before going on stage, led by the theater manager, quietly went to Second Madam Weng's box to thank her. After the manager introduced him, he smiled and gave Second Madam Weng a half bow and left. And this slight smile even more deeply intoxicated Second Madam Weng's heart, her soul was hooked away by this slight smile! On this day, Shi Yulou sang "Drunken Concubine," and she stared at Shi Yulou without blinking. At this time, she suddenly nervously discovered that Shi Yulou was "flirting" with her, and she was so happy that she immediately grabbed Madam Mo and shouted! Startling the onlookers around her to stare at her. The next day, she invited Shi Yulou to dinner at a restaurant, with Madam Mo and Chunli accompanying. This time she was satisfied, she got to sit next to Shi Yulou; she got to talk to Shi Yulou; she got to look at Shi Yuqi as much as possible, and she felt that at this time she alone—at most two people—occupied Shi Yulou; unlike in the theater, where many people watched Shi Yulou, and even loved Shi Yulou. Shi Yulou did not talk much, only often smiled, and Second Madam Weng was captured by this smile! From then on, Second Madam Weng gradually became familiar with Shi Yulou. She not only often went to listen to his opera; invited him to eat at restaurants, but also invited him to her home for secret rendezvous. Anyway, Master Weng was always in dreamland during the day.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou's costume and makeup were indeed beautiful, and he himself was also very handsome. He was only thirty years old, but his body was terribly weak. Perhaps he was too deeply influenced by the opera, every move was like a woman, gentle, refined, and never spoke loudly. Second Madam Weng was completely a woman in front of Madam Mo; in front of Shi Yulou, she turned into a complete man. Shi Yulou was considered a famous actor of his time, and his singing and performance were above average. Therefore, there were quite a few people who supported him, even men were fascinated by him. Everything about him satisfied Second Madam Weng, only this jealousy caused by Shi Yulou caused her pain!</p>
<p>Also, Shi Yulou also had the same opium addiction as Master Weng, which made it difficult for Second Madam Weng! She hated this thing from the bottom of her heart, but she couldn't persuade Shi Yulou to quit, because Shi Yulou relied on opium to boost his spirits in recent years, without it, he couldn't sing at all. Therefore, Second Madam Weng not only couldn't stop him, but even stole Master Weng's well-cooked pure opium paste to give to Shi Yulou in order to win his favor. The reason why Bai Yulou was willing to go to the Weng's house was also for this reason. Second Madam Weng could take advantage of the time when Master Weng was sleeping to steal the opium paraphernalia and give it to Shi Yulou. Second Madam Weng had already been trained by Master Weng, so she was very good at preparing the opium and serving Shi Yulou.</p>
