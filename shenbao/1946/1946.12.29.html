<h3>傳作義談察省軍政　十二戰區長官部下月遷張　並盡力為綏西後套除水害</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕傳長官作義來平，與十一戰區會商聯防事畢，廿八日下午飛返張垣，傳氏行前曾接見記者，對記者所提廣泛問題，一一作答。</p>
<p>（一）軍事部份：傅氏首對外傳所謂太原西北各省聯防會議說，謂「毫無所開」。並稱：「鄧寶珊怎可離開榆林」。繼稱，察省十六縣城俱在國軍手中，察省腹地共軍甚零星，惟省邊地帶共軍仍具力量，察北草原現僅有雲澤所屬兩個團活動，大同附近之左雲，右主約有共軍萬人，目前大同。張垣間尙能確保，大同·太原間歸十二戰區，亦未聞有打通計劃。多倫方面現由十二軍駐防，暫歸東北行營。榆林爲十二戰區境界，補給仍由十二戰區負責，指揮方面則暫歸西北行轅。十二戰區長官部明年一月將正式遷張家只，歸綏方面設指揮所，由董主席負責十二戰區亦將劃分緩靖區，分別推進綏靖工作，惟劃區人選尙未決定，目前政府仍希望循和平途徑解決政治問題，故外間對於國軍行動之揣測多不確實，因目前尙不能自純軍事着眼也。</p>
<p>（二）政治部份：傳氏稱，目前察綏兩省府新發表人選，因有多人在京出席國大未歸，故元旦日不能行就職典禮。關於察省施政方針，亦將俟新省委　長到齊後再義。目前察省政治工作推進尙不感重大困難，因察省土地問題尙不成問題，過去共產黨在察省僅清算鬥爭到物質，糧食，錢，尚未重新分配土地，從有失去土地者，亦係自己賣出，故今日處理桎易，現省府已派員作土地澈底調查。本年察田賦兵役俱豁免，綏靖區政務會所訂各項辦法，察省大體適用，其不適宜者，亦可靈活，目前人民迫切需要安定，察省府亦正針對此而努力。至財政方面，察省目前收入等於零，明年度省經費來源之田賦，亦須待十月後始開征，可謂困難萬狀。察綏兩省俱未禁糧外運，但因政府在當地大量收購軍糧，人民存糧多就地賣出’故外運爲數不多。</p>
<p>（三）建設部份：氏稱，龍烟鐵礦因僅有廿噸之小煉鐵爐，故已停止煉鐵，而專事製礦砂，下花園電　實預算人員開己確定，廿日已開始修理，目前鍋爐完好，僅須配電盤，一三月後可望修復，發電一萬基羅瓦特，此兩大工業部門已由資源委員會接收　營外，張坦經共產黨破壞之五十八工廠，已由省方接收，現正派員赴各縣鄉訪電散失之機械器材，蒐運整理，此等工廠一俟下花園電廠恢復發電後，即可復工，惟該五十八廠多係敵偽時代日人私人經營，規模旣小，當時又係關起南口大門於蒙疆政府之溫室中培植者，將來恢復以後，恐亦有若干廠無法與沿海內地大規模工業競爭，工廠停閉後，失業之工人，省府繼續救濟，一部份已介紹爲平綏路局捶石子，其親寡孤獨者，則無代價供給食宿。</p>
<p>（四）綏西部份：綏西後套爲傳氏抗戰根據地，氏念念不忘稱：綏西一角之地，人民對抗戰實獻至大，勝利後國軍東下，無人助人民防水，至　水災，今後余將盡力爲後套除水害，興水利，將各渠口俱改爲鋼骨水泥之現代化式，現中央已允發款，行總已允撥麵粉協助，此外，余將設法於陝壩設立良好之醫院與學校，並建立一電燈公司。後套因交通不便，魚米肉菜低廉，或可爲全國之冠，如一旦包寗路延至後套，則此大好沃野，將可容納數百萬人民而毫無問題。記者詢以是吾將以數年艱苦卓絕之陝壩精神原封不變，帶至張垣，氏答：風俗與物資條件有關，過去侷處綏西，亦不得不艱苦如彼。</p>
<p>（五）內蒙部份：記者問蒙古人主張成立一總的蒙政機關，長官對此有何意見，氏稱：余尙未至發表對此問題意見之適當時機，惟余以爲解決內蒙問題，須明暸熱察綏現蒙漢雜居地帶，須顧及蒙漢兩方面，使之利益均　，相得益彰，各方如能組織考察團赴三省實地調查實况，當有益於問題之解決。現察省府尙無蒙事機構，惟擬成立臨時性約有關蒙古文化福利組織。張旗復員問題，余意先徵得蒙旗意見後，再為進行，日前察哈爾部九旗及鍚盟島珠穆沁旗，俱有代表到張坦，請求發給槍枝，俾便自衛，並請辦理救濟，察北共軍目前僅有靈洞屬之季秀山及鳥吉鄂齊爾兩獨立團，後者已有百餘人日前向四子王旗投械。綏省與外　接壤地帶尙平靜，余已下令　止國人携帶武器出入國境附　。</p>

<p>教廷公使頌詞</p>
<p>主席閣下：承敎宗庇護中十二世特派敝人爲駐中華民國全權公使，茲得晋謁貴主席呈遞國書，不勝榮幸。今日之盛舉，實遠紹七百年前之舊事，時値西方文藝復興奠定近代文明之基礎，而貴國元代武功，適橫跨歐亞，中西交通方開，敎廷即派遺傳敎士與貴國通使，惜其後交通中斷，歐亞文化之溝通，因亦未獲成果，自新大陸發現，航路甫啓，敎廷復遺著名學者，前來傳敎，嗣後又爲某種不幸問題，使雙方關係，再見疏遠，甚且未能避免若干不愉快之事，殊堪惋惜，即至最近，敎延雖屢擬與貴國政府交換使節、以種種關係，未能如願，時至今日，適爲貴國國民大會爲民族光明之前途，於創造民國之偉大革命導師孫中山先生陵墓之旁，訂定憲法之時，敎廷得正式遺派使節來駐貴國，實天主其其所使。貴國在貴主席英明領導下，曾作九年長期抗戰，獲得最後勝利，今在急劇而光輝之社會演變中，得逕向一數千年文明國家之前程自由邁進，敎宗對貴國之改革與建設，極爲關懷同情，並　貴屬天主敎敎會作有力之貢獻。至今年教宗遴選田耕華氏爲樞機主敎，贊瀼敎廷中樞，成立中國敎會，正常體制，勅封中國殉敎敎友牟眞福，派遺使節留駐貴國等，皆爲敎宗尊重偉國之重要表示，敞人拜命伊始，即欣逢其盛，尤値貴主席繼續領導費國建國大業之時，實深榮幸。貴主席前所發表各種宏論，全球天主教大士，莫不欽佩，尤以勝利日之廣播演詞，最受歡迎。貴主席謂「我相信此後地無分東西，人無分　色，凡人類都會一天一天加速的密切聯合，不童成爲家人手足。」此正與敎宗呼籲各民族　　絲解互相信任之　翅相　會：貴主席又請：「世界之新秩序，應以耶蘇　督所啓示之仁愛爲　　。」尤見貴主席見解之崇高，爲貴國政治家之典範，此種共同觀點，乃增進敎廷與此國密切關係之重要理由，亦爲敎宗對貴主席及貴團全體國民所深切祝望者，謹祝貴主席政躬康泰，大中華民國國運昌隆，敎廷駐華公使黎培理。</p>
<p>主席答詞</p>

<h3>年終雙薪問題起糾紛　京民營報紙停刋　有關機關調停尚無結果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕首都十四家民營報紙，廿八日全部停刋，出版者僅屯央日報與和平日報及尙未加入報聯之南京日報，與社會日報四家。停刋原因，由於工友向資方提條件，要求年終發雙薪，自十二月起增薪百分之六十。廿七日下午四時，社會局曾召集勞方百餘人談話，洽商調停，未獲結果，八時社局復請資方各報社長開會，資方表示加薪可照本月薪增百分之四十，年終雙薪不可能，當晚遂未開工。二十八日上午，資方復開會討論解決辦法，當時決定（一）加薪百分之四士，（二）年終雙薪不答應，（三）限今晚復刋，否則即由當局查封工廠，工人膳宿自二十九起停止供應，至復工時止。下午由社局市黨部及衛戍部出面調解，召集工方代表會商，未獲協議，資方晚間在上海飯店續商，同時工方代表亦在某旅館，迄下午八時尙無結果。</p>
<p>〔又電〕關於民營報紙勞資料紛問題，中宜部於廿八日晚九時，特派周科長與十四家報紙資方代表南京人報社長張友雙，及勞方代表兩人，繼續磋商解決辦法，仍未獲具體結果。惟關於加薪問題已獲協議，至年終雙薪問題，資方亦有讓步表示，僅對「雙薪」之名稱，尙待洽商。</p>
<h3>宣慰荷印僑胞歸來　李迪俊詳述經過　昨晚晉京向主席報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國駐古巴公使李迪俊，二月前奉派赴荷屬東印度宜慰華僑，於前日返滬。李氏昨日上午十一時假華懋飯店招待記者，詳述宣慰經過及當地僑胞情况。</p>
<p>李氏首稱：東印度華僑因抗戰關係，與祖國隔離甚久，但愛國熱忱並未因此稍减，宣慰團在二個月間，曾到達四十餘處地方，僑胞一見宣慰團，猶如獲睹祖國父母，莫不興奮異常，熱列歡迎，由衷感謝祖國政府並未對僑胞未嘗忘懷不顧。而離政治中心巴達維亞愈遠之僑民，愛國之情更爲深切。</p>
<p>愛國心重</p>
<p>華僑所處環境相當複雜：戰爭期開，受到犧牲極重，物質損失更大，有錢有智議僑胞，均被敵囚禁集中營，西婆羅洲華僑被敵砍頭死亡者達七百餘人。但勝利之後，又因印度尼西亞之革命運動，華僑處在聯軍（即英軍），荷印臨時政府及印尼政府三方面爭鬥之下，痛苦萬分。東印度共有華僑二百萬人，其中由祖國前往者一百二十萬人，土生者八十萬人，華僑經濟地位頗高，而敎育水準允較其他國家僑胞爲優，有智識階級均能說流利國語，並能通荷蘭·英·馬來亞·德等數國文字語言。過去土生僑胞與新客（即由國內去東印度者）間似隔鴻溝，互相不睦，因土生僑胞生長於荷印政府統治下，對祖國隔膜，但自戰後及印尼獨立運動發生後，熊度已改變，國家觀念亦漸濃厚，乃均學習中國文字，研究中國情形。</p>
<p>印尼情形</p>
<p>近二三個月來，東印度情形已較穩定，荷蘭於十月十五日與印尼簽訂停戰協定，於十二月十五日簽定政治協定草案，但正式簽字尙須待荷蘭國會通過後舉行。局部衝突雖仍不免，但已不致影響華僑生命財產。政治協定簽立後，荷＼荷蘭承認爪准，蘇門答臘及門多拉三島成立一印尼共和國，至一九四九年一月一日則將組織一印尼合聚騰，除共和開外，其他各島均可以平等地位參加爲一單位。荷蘭王室則爲合衆國之一聯繫機構。然印尼本身軍政均極複雜，本國軍隊分正規軍，民軍及極端份子。此極端份子，因印尼亟　中國了以協助，但一年來中國本身問題未獲解決，無能爲力，致不免失望，爲報復起見，乃不時騷擾我僑民。此次李氏曾召集各地首長，詳加解釋，略謂：中國根據國父遺敎，對任何弱小民族之革命均極表同情，尤以亞洲民族爲甚。中國與東印度經濟文化往米歷史已達一千五百年之久，中國政府絕對希望今後能繼續維持友誼，互相合作，盡力協助，但協助程度須以保證華僑生命財產爲標準。李氏曾歸納十點意見，遞交印尼內閣總理，對方已表示歉意，相信以後不致再有同樣事件發生，對所提意見，決逐步辦理。印尼並決於明年派訪華團來華。系印尼境內政黨，達五十餘單位，其中包括印尼中國黨，有黨員約二千人。</p>
<p>苦悶之點</p>
<p>至僑胞所感受難於解決之問題有數點：（一）不論在荷印區，印尼區，鴻區（兩政府交界）內之僑民，均受不平等待遇，其中以在印尼區者較佳。（二）國籍問題，最近印尼法律，凡在印尼出生一華人，均應為印尼國民，如不願者須在明年四月底前公開聲明。但華僑雖不願爲印尼國民，一方面又恐於發表聲明後，對本身不利，致至今仍維持雙重國籍。（三）印尼革命雖稱係受中國辛亥革命之影響，認爲亦是三民主義，但對於華僑經濟地位仍加以統制，華僑極盼中國政府經濟專家予以協助及支持，明春擬派代表返華考察。、</p>
<p>宣慰團在東印度曾代僑胞解決若千問題，如敵人佔領東印度時，當地採取焦土政策，所受損失中，多數　華僑財產，經交涉後，荷印政府己允賠償。目前開始修理工廠百分之三十，在三四月內可恢復百分之六十，以後繼續恢復，但不能全部賠償。日人徵用華僑之物資，亦允發　，至賠償損失方面，原則上當局亦巳予承認，現僑民已開始呈報。</p>
<p>僑滙問題</p>
<p>又如僑匯問題，當局巳允明年一月起開放，但規定全部僑民共匯一萬盾，以後視情形逐漸增加。依目前之官價，美金一元，等於二·六六盾。</p>
<p>李氏並稱，渠於返國前並曾向荷印政府提出有關華僑之問題十八點，荷印總督，已允予辦理。</p>
<p>李氏於昨晚晚車晋京，向主席及外交部報吿，並提建議。下月中將再來滬，與中央銀地貝總裁祖抬商談羅款問題。李氏並稱：此次宣慰工作，各方均可稱滿意，並非即可謂對華僑任務完畢。而係解決華僑問題之開始耳。</p>
<h3>我出席聯大代表　劉錯等今可抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我出席聯合國大會代表外部次和工劉鍇，定今日下午三時卅五分乘美機自舊金山抵滬。該機孫於本月廿六日自舊金山啓程者。將降落江灣機塲，乘客共十八名，除劉次長外，尙有中國出席大會副代表，中國銀行花旗銀行人員及聯總專門技衛人員等，該機為C/54型大運輪機，機號為NC七九〇六人，載有信件及獎品等約一千磅，此間外交部已準備派員赴機塲歡迎。</p>

<h3>澀谷事件主犯　三個被提公訴　警局長等「違背佔領軍目的」</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿七日電〕橫濱軍事法庭之三人委負會，五日正式爲曾於七月十九日目擊日本警察與合胞發生槍擊事件之灑谷警察局高級官員三人提出公訴。謂其「違背佔領軍目標」。此三人爲澀谷警察局局長土屋桑土，副局長（姓名漏）及該局之華僑督察宮宇春維。該局正副局長被控惡意及錯誤命令管轄之警察過度及不必要向羣衆（包括聯合國人民）開火，致死七人，傷若干人，此舉顯搗亂和平及在該地人民間引起恐怖，故已違背佔領軍之自標。按涉及澀谷事件之台胞，共有四十名，彼等最近業經另一三人委員會在東京判處二年及三年勞役或放逐出境。</p>
<h3>菲律賓華僑攤販　控告財長瓜德諾　取締攤販命令超出法律規定</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺廿八日電〕華八百攤販頃在馬尼刺法庭控告菲律賓財政部長瓜德諾，市政府會計及本埠市場老聞，以為則阻止此輩官員奪取其在本埠市場攤鋪最後之一着，華僑攤販則指出十一月廿六日財政部長瓜德諾所頒佈之強制，宣佈在任何公共市場之一切攤鋪，應由原主撤出，若於十二月三十一日有外人設攤者，則與申請之非人一事，與菲共和國法規三十七條所列者未能吻合，故其命令無效，其於私人亦無拘押力量，彼等謂此項命令所千涉之事，已超出其法律所規定之權限矣。</p>

<p>法越衝突的範圍日益擴大，己非尋常事件可比了，其後果不僅將危及遠東一隅的和平，而且也足以影響及整個世界政局的發展，故已引起世界各國的注視。英國外相貝文己請內閣，依據英國駐法大使與駐東南亞洲特使基勒恩勛爵所提出的報吿，研究當前的越南問題；美國代理國務卿艾契遜，也向報界發表談話稱，越南問題雖爲法國政府之事，但美國政府己與法國政府保持密切接觸，希望刻在法越發生衝突地點調查眞相的法國海外殖民地部長莫戴，早日提出報吿。這一段談話，雖是非常婉轉的外交辭令，淸描淡寫，並無十分嚴重的意義；但是內心對於越南局勢的焦慮，是不可掩飾的。此在中國，因爲有着同胞四十三萬五千八百人僑居在越南，所謂「城鬥失火，殃及池魚」，在法越所發生的任何衝突中，僑胞的生命財產，無往而不遭受到重大的損失，中國駐河內總領事，雖然幾次三番，向法越雙方提出建議，主張在越南劃分一中立區，俾由華僑與　好和平的越人居住。但是這個安全計劃，始終未能實現，更使中國政府爲這許多僑胞的生命財產的安全而焦愁，故也不得不採取具體而有效的護僑措置。</p>
<p>從中，英？美諸國的觀點看來，固然大家都希望法越雙方，均能放下武器，在越南方面，不可再採取恐怖行動；在注國方面，也不可再採取高壓政策，而以和平友好的精神，重開和談，謀得越南問題的澈底解決。其實替法國的實際利益打算，法國也應該迅速設法獲得和平解決的。例如法國共產黨政治委員會通過決議，也主張法國政府應該立即與維明政府進行和談，俾由雙方在法蘭西聯邦的範圍以內，忠誠合作，並謂法國若干反動派，直接反對維明政府。而採取暴力與挑釁的行動，對於國家利益，也是有損無益的。何現社會黨領袖勃魯姆，在就任內閣總理之後，亦曾向法國人民保證法國政府必能依照法越協定的精神而努力，俾獲得和平的早日恢復；勃魯姆總理對內對外所提供的諾言能吾兌現，目下的法越衝突，就是一個最好的試金石。</p>
<p>但是綜合各方面的報導，法國對於越　所採取的態度，可於下列各端中見之：　法國軍事當局奉政府之命，急調生力軍開往越南增援；（二）法國海外殖民地部長莫戴在西貢發表演說，堅決拒絕越南人民的獨立要求，並謂「注國決不能以民族自決權畀予南圻及安南南部之人民」。（三）法國飛機已正式參戰，在河內上空，轟炸越軍集中地點。（四）法國政府調查團發表初步報吿，亦稱法越衝突，應由越南負全部責任。（五）維明政府駐法代表團新聞專員在馬賽被注國警察加以逮捕。</p>
<p>由上所述，法國政府爲維護其在越南的威信起見，勢將蠻幹到底，殆無疑義。此在越南方面，越人受了民族主義的激盪！爲民族的解放而奮鬥到底，決不會知難而退或半途而廢的。維明共和政府總統胡志明於本月二十五日。發表聖誕節廣播，曾要求法軍退出越南全境；此在越南國民黨領袖阮祥三氏，也在南京活動，除了籲請中美兩國出而調處注越衝突而外，並主張組織「國民陣錢政府」，準備與維明政府，釋嫌修好，爲共同的主張，爭取獨立，與法國奮鬥到底，同時散遍各地的越軍，紛紛採取攻勢，與法軍作殊死戰。使法越衝突的範圍，愈演愈大。</p>
<p>這種大可憂慮的局勢，如果任其自然發展下去，而不設法挽救，則將造成非常嚴重的後果，是不堪設想的。所以在這千鈞一髮的重大關頭，法國的政治家應能高瞻遠矚，當機立斷，從速使越南流血的慘劇，得以早、日結束。我們站在第三者的立塲，願向注國當局進言：第一，法國負責當局須知：在第二次大戰結束之後的今日，帝國主義的時代，早己成爲歷史上的陳蹟，法國對待越南，決不可因襲過去的殖民政策；這次注越衝突的發生，如果要追究責任，則其咎不在越南，而法國駐越南高級專員達香里歐海軍中將與駐南圻專員賽蒂尼之流，實應負全部責任。因爲他們對待越南，仍未改變過去對待殖民地的作風，以致引起越南人民的公頃。一怒不可遏，，就引起了這一次的不幸事件。第二，戰後法國人民的思想及其政治，都有長足的進步。尤其是法國的新憲法，具有遠大的理想，爲世界各國所欽佩；但是對於民族自决的一項神聖原則。還沒有澈底的認識。法國海外部長莫戴在西貢听發表的演說，不僅不能發生安定的作用，反而要火上加油，徒然加深越南人民對於法國的仇恨。第三，我們也知道越南問題，足以引起法國國內的政潮，但是勃魯姆政府一味採取高壓政策，企圖以武力解決越南問題，我們相信其結果，必歸於失敗。因爲越南的民氣是不可侮的，決非用飛機，大砲，以及坦克車所能征服的。</p>
<p>要之，越南的局勢愈演愈嚴重了，法國負責當局應該保持冷靜，重行考慮其所採取的政策，迅作腎明的抉擇，以免局勢的益趨惡化，以致陷於不可收拾的困境。</p>

<h3>原子能委員會繼續開會　蘇波代表態度消極　巴魯克堅决反對否决權　美新提案已獲通過待作最後决定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國原子能委員會起草小組會本日舉行秘密會議，通過其向安全理事會之最後報告。當時法國代表巴洛迪得英代表之擁護，曾竭力主張報告書不涉及否決極一事。此一問題曾引起法·英·加拿大·波蘭一方與中·美·巴西·墨西哥·荷蘭·澳大利亞一方間這爭辯。蘇聯代表亞歷出大洛夫則拒不參加辯論。按法國代表日前曾向美代表團提出一項條款原文，主张應規定倘過遠犯行動而搆成國際罪案時，「違法國家不得以合理方法送避其違法行動之後果」。美代表乃建議列入「由否決權或其他方法」一語，以確定「合理方法」一詞。但法代表堅決反對，認爲列入此語後，將令人感覺原子能委員會有修改聯合國憲章之意。反之，美代表巴魯克則力方美國建議仍維特憲章中所規定之一致原則。最後該委會仍照美國之新提案通過，惟附加一備註，說明蘇聯未參加辯論，並說明除列入「由否決權或其他方法」一語外，其他各點均經一致同意。惟此事尙待全體委員作最後決定。今後英加代表表示當服從多數而遵守此項決議，但法代表則謂須請示外交部後再定行動云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿七日電〕美代表巴魯克今日在聯合國原子能委會坦白宣布美國不能放棄原子彈秘密，除非五大國對於懲罰違反原子公約者不行使否決權。該委會今日秘密會議，討論美國所提原子管制計劃八小時之久。巴魯克要求將此問題常塲表決，據稱：「在任何利用狡猾手段使懲罰失效之制度下，余不能向美國人民及參院建議放棄此種有力武器，而以生產原子能之偉大智識公諸於世。吾人所要求者，乃在投票贊成任何一國或其友邦，因違反公約而須受懲罰時，不得利用其本身之否決權。反之，如以爲違約者應有此種權利，則儘可投票反對吾人之立塲，或放棄或拒絕投票。」巴氏所謂拒絕參加表決，顯然係指蘇聯與波籣，因蘇聯曾聲明不參加投票，波蘭則表示放棄投票權。先是巴魯克並稱：問題重心，在於條約神聖，抑係否決應種聖，並以尖刻語調稱：「余不知存心維護條約之一國、何以需要否決權。蓋唯有蓄意破壞條約之國家，乃需要否決權之保護也」。巴魯克發言前，英法代表贊成禁用否決權，但反對在最後草的中明文加以規定。英代表稱：所以採取此種立塲，在求全體一致，而免蘇聯反對。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國原子能委會之執委會，今晨舉行會議，討論政治小組委會對於管制原子能所通過之報吿書技術部份，當即加以批准，波蘭及蘇聯兩國代表並未出席，故各方對於該兩國今後之能度，仍揣測紛紜。此外執委會並定於本日下午趨續會議，其所當討論之問題有二：即（一）討論美加兩國聯名提出之決議草案，該項決議草案已在前次秘密會議中獲得通過，其所遵循之原則，大致與美代表巴魯克之計劃相似，但並未提及否決權問題；（二）決定執委會對於下列二項問題所當採取之能度，即（甲）美代表巴魯克所提出之計劃，（乙）安理會常任理事國對於制栽行使否決權問題。執委會如若不能成立協議，蘇聯及波籣兩國若再度缺席，則法代表團將提出一項折衷方案，將制栽分爲大小兩種，規定安理會常任理事國對於小制裁得使用否決權，但對於大制栽則不得使用否決權。</p>
<h3>越南戰事向南擴展　北圻中圻全綫有激戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕令日據法國人方面消息：越南戰事已擴大至南圻南部，平民罹難渚廿四人。法越雙方各不相讓之態度，益見其甚，法軍已在西貢宜布戒嚴。聖誕夜，西貢附近公路上有安南人印度人與華僑所坐之汽車三輛被襲擊，二十人罹難，其中有英人一名，另有一車載運敎士及安南兒童一隊，被伏丘襲擊，兒童兩人斃命，敎士四名重傷，法官方解釋此種夜閒狙擊，乃越盟遊擊隊企圖切斷南圻南部全境交通錢，或爲向北圻全面進行此種襲擊之初步。此外，各地零星消息，報吿北圻與中圻全綫有多次激烈衝突，越南人民共和國總統胡志明曾在秘密電台發表廣播，要求法軍退出越南全境。</p>
<h3>法越衝突　根本原因</h3>
<p>美報認妥協希望渺茫</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕紐約時報今日載有越南事件專論，預料該處衝突一時無法解決，且將擴大。該報記者於本月初曾在越晤法國維明及交趾支那安南地下運動之各領袖，認爲法維爭執之根本原因，在於交趾支那之地位，故維明政府可能令交趾支那產米區之安南地下活動人員開始行動，開闢第二戰錢。當該報記者在越時，交趾支那之休戰協定尙被尊重，惟非法之「安南執委會」仍從事積極之政治活動，而法當局方面則施用高壓，對付反對親法之交趾支那共和國之人，其手段如禁止報紙刋載法方認爲寓有抨擊之蕙之文字等。至於逮捕安南遊擊隊，則屬常有之事。至於雙方手段，自中立立塲而論，似均嫌過火，因此決國與維明遂經常處於爆炸性之緊張局勢之下。越南戰爭之根源，在於維明之不滿意芳登納勃魯協定（胡志明與法政府之協定）及維明之企圖將交趾支那併入其共和國。當然此項企圖，乃法國所斷難以認可者，雙方立塲旣如此懸殊，故妥協之望似極渺茫云。</p>
<h3>印報猛烈抨擊　法殖民政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新讓且二十七日電〕印度中部及北部報抵數家，今日著論痛斥法軍在越南之舉動。尼　魯在勃克拿　主辦之國民日報，其社論標題爲「越南舉行」，謂目前在越南發生之暴行，除法國欲以種種形式及種種名義把　其殖民地外，別無解釋。越南人抵抗法國此種跋　政策，應獲得亞洲全部民族之同情。印度希望裝之殖民主由以致命打擊，亞洲各國皆應如是」，德里國民民聲報亦稱：「聯合國機構對於破壞和平及國際協定之事，若不能加以制栽，則全世界人民均將失法其信仰。各國政府與納粹主議奮力搏　，歷時六載，自不應再以訥粹方決對付其意見不洽之人民云。」</p>
<h3>英政府注意　東南亞局勢　務使法國威望不受挫折　殖已地戰爭非英法之福</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敎廿七日電〕頃悉英國外相貝文，不久將請英國內閣研究東南亞局勢，英國駐法大使與英國駐東南亞特使基勒思勛爵，對於越南戰事，均有詳情報吿政府。聞東南亞洲之局勢，可能影響及英國利益，故英國應爲下列二事：（一）英國刻正設法促進與暹羅之友好關係（二）法國之威望不應遭受挫折。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕孟却斯特保報今日評論越南局勢稱，「巴黎激烈份子認爲法國決不應與越南人民共和國談判，但頭腦淸晣者深知，僅憑武力以維持法國在越南等處之地位，殊非善策。法國與英國，過去均嘗從事掠奪殖民地戰爭，其結果，本身並未遭受嚴重損失，惟時至今日，世界大勢已變，英法兩國之任何部份如發生殖民地戰爭，均足動搖其全部構造。」</p>
<h3>法政府態度堅决　爭調增援部隊赴越南　共黨促恢復和平談判</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國著埠廿七日電〕頃悉：法國郵船「法蘭西島」，定於明日運送新徵士兵八千人，自此前往卡薩勃朗期加港，然後駛返土倫，載送法軍援軍前往越南。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿八日電〕越南境內之定期航空班，自今日起暫停，俾便調用該項飛機運輸軍隊，惟經政府特准者仍可照常飛行。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕法軍當局奉政府令，急調增援部隊前往越南，詳細情報始終嚴守秘密，巴黎方面今日謂，維明局勢無甚變更，此間人士復信法殖民部台在越期閒，當不致發動與領袖談判，惟若干消息靈通</p>
<p>則認如有機會，當與彼等取得非正式之接觸。法政麻在秩序完全恢復維軍完全停止軍事行動前，似決不願與維明談判。法政府且將堅決主張任何未來之維明政府，必須有眞正之代表性，始願與其談判。法國共黨對於政府能度之轉趨强硬，並不表示同意，該黨政治局今日通過決議，力主迅速恢復談判，以取得法維間之真正合作。法外部今日並披露維明總統胡志明於十二月十九日下午及晚間分別致法駐河內特派員森德尼及法軍司令莫利愛之兩報密函，請法專員根據巴黎決議，改善局勢，並告莫利愛謂，法方之若干建議將於翌日由維明內閣考慮，當菲利愛正　該函時，電燈突然熄滅，蓋維明軍已波壞電廠而發動攻勢矣。</p>
<h3>法國殖已部長　調查初步結果</h3>
<p>認越盟應負衝突責任</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西質廿七日電〕法國殖民部長嘉台率領法政府代表團前來越南，調查法越衝突，抵達此間迄已四十八小時，現正開始積極工作。據半官方人士談稱：慕台部長初步調查結果，已足證目下衝突應由越盟政府負其責任。越盟政府利用法越談判之機會，從事組織軍事機關已非一日。越軍進襲法軍係在數地同時進行，足證此事於事先早已有所計劃。法越臨時條約之主要條款，規定法越雙方立即停止衝突，但越盟政府並無實施該項條約之意向。此在法國方面則無時不竭力與越南獲致協議。此外越南軍隊業已竄入南圻境內，雖已停止作戰，但仍繼續到處伏擊，此種伏擊決不能目爲個別之企圖，法國曾派遺聯絡代表團與越軍當局接觸，但其團員軏遭越軍襲擊，因而受傷或殞命，如在海防即發生此種事件，深望越盟政府人士能脫離極端派之控制，而恢復其對法協議之政策云。</p>
<h3>越盟在海塘　設行政機構</h3>
<p>歡迎慕台前來談商</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿七日電〕據越盟政府地下報紙載：越盟政府總統胡志明函稱，越盟政府業在海塘（河內海防之間）設立行政機構。此外胡志明總統並已訓令其駐在南圻之代表，令其發動和平，而莊嚴之非武裝示威遊行，向法國殖民部長慕台提出越南人民之要求，即「打倒南圻霍許傀儡政府」「召回法駐越高級專員違香遺　　軍中將」「歡迎慕台部長」。此項命令到達西貢暹　，故朱能遵行。又據越盟政府發言人發表廣播滇辭稱，越盟敵府歡迎慕台部長前來越南，請慕台部長來海塘興胡志明總統舉行會商云。</p>
<h3>挪威探險家壯舉　明春乘木筏　橫渡在平洋</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕美陸軍部宜稱：挪威探險家。希爾達及其他挪威人五名，將於朋年二月乘木筏自秘魯之伊羅，前往玻里尼西亞（大洋洲）。伊等此次四千英里之長征，係用以考察玻島原有居民及文化。希氏此行獲爲其現論覓取根據，蓋渠認爲太平洋原先之居民，係由美洲前往，而非自亞州前往睿。此諸　　探險家所乘木筏，將在海洋上　流四月之久，此等木筏係以最輕之木料。按古秘魯木船形式製成。惟該筏上將裝設無綫電及敎生之設備。希氏稱：渠等此行目的，係實騐此次航行之可能性如何，及證實秘魯文化之是否會傳播中太平洋。</p>

<h3>舊事重提　邱吉爾積極鼓吹　組織歐洲合衆國　希望中國成為一等已主國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿八日電〕柯里爾雜誌載邱吉爾論文，重申其組織歐洲聯邦之主張，並希望中國不久將成爲一等民主國家。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日電〕英國前任首相邱吉爾本日在「柯里爾」雜誌以「走向將來之大道」爲題，發表一文，叉主張「組織歐洲合衆國，」其文略稱：共產主義與基督敎義以及西方文化閒之分裂，充滿人類前所朱聞之致命後果，法國必須在歐洲發出自由之信號，良以法國欲恢復其固有之眞正光榮，以及其在世界上之原來地位，捨此而外，實無他法也。法國必須提携德國人民，領導其重入國際社會。猶憶法國大文豪囂俄於一八七一年時，曾在波爾多城向法國國民大會呼籲、組織歐洲合衆國，此種見解，實屬高人一等。大西洋巳不復能作為美國之屏障，歐洲之僧恨，有滲入美國之可能，故美國必須援用其力量，消除傳染中心之細菌，組織歐洲合衆國，對於美國之安全，實屬必要。</p>
<p>聯合國機構除非其內部有一强大之組織存在否則必將歸於失敗。以言歐洲組織合衆國之計劃，本人認爲歐洲必須廢除關稅壁壘，樹立經濟協調，並採用相同之幣制。是以再生之歐洲，並不反對俄國或蘇維埃，惟歐洲組織合衆國必遭共產黨之反對。共產黨必須解決飢饉問題，良以此乃共產黨統治世界之必要條件故也。在目前思想衝突之時期，原子炸彈乃爲一種新的平衡之因素，所幸原子炸彈現爲美國所有，當能予世界以相當時期之和平，但其時間之久暫，目下殆難斷言。要而言之，吾人在走向將來之大道中，倘欲獲得成功，實有在歐洲及基督世界，恢復生活與團結之必要云。</p>
<h3>爭景凋年談世局</h3>
<p>一九四六年是現代史上極重要的一年。世界大戰固然已在去年結束，但是遺留下來的許多困難和複雜的課題，都要在本年度內獲得解決，至少也要開關一個解決的途徑。古諺有曰：「同患難易，共安樂難」。事實上，處理戰後的問題，的確比處理戰時的問題更其棘手。在道一年中，會議是開得熱鬧極了，雖然成就的程度各有不同，但多少有了一點收穫，例如對義羅匈保芬五國的和的草案已經擬就準備簽字了；對日對德和的問題雖然尙未付諸討論，但是離正式討論的日子也不遠了；原子能管制問題雖然依舊是一大織結，但自普遍裁軍案在聯大獲得通過後，前途似乎也明朗了一點。過些因素，都値得樂觀。可是如其我們以爲世界可以從此太平無事，仍不免輕率武撕。因爲在目前的世界上，的確還有許多內在的矛盾和衝突存在，就是表面上暫時和緩一點，實際上離根本解決之日尙遠。在這急景凋年的當兒，不妨來漫談一下當前的世界形勢。</p>
<p>今日世界更見緊湊</p>
<p>根據「世界報吿週刊」特派員的觀察，認爲一九四六年的世界大勢，有幾個特點是很明顯的：就是今日的世界，巳經更縮小更緊凑了。幾年前，世界上有六七個「强國」，彼此牽制而維持着均勢，但在今日，力足以左右世界大局的國家，祇有三國，至多也祇有五國了。至於能否造成均勢，目前猶在未定之天。</p>
<p>蘇聯是當今第二强國；她結集了若干衛星國家和鄰近地區而自成一個緊凑的政治。經濟。軍略單位。名列第一位和第三位的美英兩國，在理想上，許多共同利益上和政策上都是非常接近的；她們想努力抵制蘇維埃世界的擴張政策。在這種情形之下，世界很明顯地被　分成兩大部份，無論在觀念上，政治理論上和國際行動上，都有極大的出入。聯合國機稱雖然已把五十餘國團結起來，負起維護和平安全與促進人類進步的責任，但是一時也還難以發揮消滅世界畛域的效能。此外原子彈的發明以及其他技術科學方面的進步，使世界形勢隨時有改觀的可能，而世局也因此而更見複雜，雖人人有解決僵局之心，惟苦無解決僵局之力。</p>
<p>世界可分四個區域</p>
<p>爲便於說明起見，我們不妨把世界劃成四個區域：（一）安全區城；（二）紛擾區城；（三）緊張區域；（四）控制區域。所謂安全區域，是指因地理環境關係不直接牽入蘇維埃世界和西方世界紛爭的地方，例如澳洲自侵路國日本被擊潰後，比較上可以輿世無爭，自有一塊天地。菲洲的南半部和南美洲，也可以歸入這一類。</p>
<p>粉擾區城是揩本身具有特殊問題而不能安定下來的地方。這種問題和世界列强不是沒有關係的。蘇聯認爲這些地方是散播共產主義種子的沃土，西方國家則認爲她們在那裏的優先地位有遭遇威脅的可能。道些地方隨時有變成緊張地區的危臉，但目前還沒有發展到這種程度。印度，東南亞，荷屬東印度，北菲等地，都可以歸入這一類。</p>
<p>緊張區域是蘇維埃世界和西方世界的政策和利益，磨擦衝突最直接，糾紛最繁多的地方。中束，中歐（包括特港區在內）等地屬之。</p>
<p>控制區域就是蘇維世界和西方世界本身。大體一言之，西方世界包括北美，南美北部，英國和歐洲西部；蘇維埃世界則東起白令海，西至易北河和亞德里亞海。</p>
<p>在這四種地區中，安全區和紛擾區比較上屬於次要，我們不妨集中目光於控制區與緊張區。</p>
<p>蘇聯領土極為完整</p>
<p>蘇維埃世界佔陸地總面積五分之一，這塊土地的完整性舉世無出其右，可能成爲地球上最自給自足的部份，固時是由一個集權的力量統率的。從防禦上講，這一部份土地佔有最堅强的地位；從攻路上講，陸空兩軍的力量佔有極大的概勢。惟在海植方面，由於地理環境的限　，未能充份發揮。</p>
<p>從英美的標準講，蘇聯還是一個尙未開發的國家，但在白種人國家中，人口最多，擁有全世界最大的陸軍，資源豐富，生產量正與日俱增中。國民性格堅韌耐苦，管束嚴密，在政治上和思想上具有擴張的　動，並自信在不久將來能製造原子彈。</p>
<p>西方世界頗佔伏優勢</p>
<p>西方世界以面積言，的與蘇維埃世界相等，但在軍略因素上却大不相同。從地理上講，它爲大西洋所分隔，而蘇縱埃世界部成一整個單位。西方世界的領凖權合操於英美兩國之手，有時候由英美兩國分別掌握。英美間和英美與其他西方國家間的關係，則旣不確定亦不堅固。從軍略上講，西方世界與蘇維埃世界相較，其缺點乃在組織不够健全，指揮不够統一。此外西方國家的軍略位置也不及蘇維埃世界，因爲西默和英國極易遭遇攻擊，不易堅守。除了這兩種因素以外，西方世界在軍略的任何方面，幾乎都勝過蘇維埃世界。更有進者，原子彈的威力，也是目前西方世界掌握的一大軍略優勢。</p>
<p>歲云暮矣。在一九四六年年終的時候，世界大勢彷彿如此，至於粉結能否消除，僵局熊否打開，須視整個人類的智慧，究已進化到了若何程度而定。（亞農節　自「世界報告馴升』）</p>

<h3>南斯拉夫軍隊　調往希臘邊界　希當局稱希北局勢好轉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿七日電〕頃據可靠方面消息：南斯拉夫刻正將其駐在匈牙利邊界之所有軍隊，調至希臘邊界。南斯拉夫採取此行動，實由於聯合國機構安全理事會決定派遣調查委員會，前來希臘北部，有以致之。據希臘政府某高級官員稱：南國調動其軍隊，目的乃在調查委員會進行調查時，避免發生意外。此外，又據希臘北部行政長官羅杜浦洛斯語本社記者稱：希臘北部局勢，自七月以還，巳見好轉。目下匪徒在希臘北部活動者，可分成三類，即（一）其領袖所採取之政策，係反對希臘之理想者。（二）職業匪徒內心充滿搶刧與犯罪之精神。（三）自民間所徵募之份子，此輩並無任何理想，僅抱有冒險之精神與憎恨希臘之心理。第一第二類匪徒蒙受損失頗大，現投降者頗衆，第三類匪徒深懼人數過多，故已停止徵募。陣亡匪徒之屍體，輒由其他匪徒負回，萱以其深恐死者之家屬發現之後，對於徵募將發生阻礙也。至希　政府軍及憲兵紀律良好，各村莊人民之逃往他處者，均已逐漸返鄕。</p>

<h3>墮機大慘案責任　地檢處開始澈究　正由曹鴻等三檢察官負責偵查　明日赴各處實地查勘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕耶誕節墮機死傷旅客八十餘人之大慘案，本市地檢處於事件發生後即密切汴意，靜待各方報吿。唯截止昨日，迄未獲得航空公司及出事地點警局之任何報吿。地檢處認爲此次三飛機之失事，航空公司應負業務上過失致人於死之法律責任。該處首席檢察官黃亮，特於昨晨諭知曹鴻，季蘇，吳啓華三檢察官負責偵查，準備自動檢舉。三檢察官受命後，立刻指派法警分別至出事地點及死亡所在地如中山醫院紅十字醫院，中美醫院及殯儀館等處，調查罹難者姓名，年齡，籍貫及其家屬等情形，同時致兩警局查詢不立即報吿法院之原因。根據刑事訴訟法第一百六十條；「遇有非病死或可疑為非病死者，該管檢察官應速相驗，如發一有犯罪嫌疑，應繼續為必要之勘驗」。故各罹難旅客遺屍，檢察官實有權命令述止收殮。唯地檢處對死難旅客家屬十分同情，當不致出此。檢察官並以曾風聞當晚出事後，在塲之救護人員，竟先從事搜刧死傷旅客隨身財物，而貽懊救護任務。趁人災危施行刦盜，實屬罪大惡極，對此亦將嚴密偵查。同時江瀅機場之盲目降落設備，何以一時不能使用，兩機場之夜航設備是否完備，何以飛機知道上海氣候惡劣，而仍必需在上海降落等疑點，皆將爲三檢察官偵查之目標。並據三承辦檢察官表示：爲充份發揮法治國家健全撿察制度之職綴，對此慘案，將本司法獨立之精神，嚴正之立塲，追求法律上責任。一俟初步偵查完畢，三檢察官將於明日分頭赴各處親自查勘。</p>

<h3>市長招待參議員　交換市預算意見　咸認數字龐大勢難難接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長以市參議會第二次大會即將召開，明年度市府預算實爲當前莫大之問題，故在提交大會正式討論前，特於昨日下午七時假警察俱樂部招待市參議會正副議長及各委員會召集人，作初步之交換意見，共到的七十人。</p>
<p>席間首由市長報吿編製預算政策及人事調整情形，略稱：市府根據緊縮行政經費及加强事業之原則，先後已裁去人員共九百人，但新增者一千三百人，乃屬敎員，營業收稅人員，及民政處工作人員等。至明年度總預算爲二千三百餘億元，視數字雖甚鉅大，但按之前工部局預算全年四千萬元，折合目前幣值比較，其比例實並不過高。市府預算均經嚴密攷慮，甚望市參議員加以審核，並能明瞭各種困難，予以通過。</p>
<p>繼由市府閔會計長說明預算編製經過，財局谷局長補充解釋稱：目前本市各界對於稅收不滿有，主要在征收市政建設捐，經再三研究，又根據市民反應，參議員等一致要求，同時卅五年度下半年澦算收支相差已可平衡，故決定冬季市政建設捐不予加倍，且可减少三分之一，其减征辦法規定如下：按民國廿六年房租全年在一百元以下者，均予免捐，此類房屋的計一萬二千戶，餘皆照秋季打折扣，按超額累進法，分全年房租五百，一千，二千者三種，自五折至八折减收。谷氏並對市參議員此次爲稅捐問題，備受市民查難，表示抱歉。</p>
<p>潘議長常即致答辭謂：日來因本市稅捐過高，市民頗多煩言，使市參議員處境甚爲困難，但市府施政亦屬必需，澦算不得不加通過，致參議員兩頭爲難，殊覺痛苦，本人昨晚由京來滬，在火市上聽市民責難聲四起，不僅感到驚奇，且甚不安。今市政當局在開會前將編製預算困難予解釋，俾共同研究，確屬合理辦法，吾人當盡量為市民設想，一方面亦應攷慮到市府施政實際問題。</p>
<p>各參議員則一致表示對市府如此龐大之預算，實難以接受，希望市政當局盡量减少人員節省公帑，而以經費多用於建設事業上。</p>
<p>最後吳市長表示對各參議員意見，決虛心接受，盡力做去，謂如本日招待會，原擬邀請全體參議員，但為節省開支起見，致不得不全僅請各組召集人云　。</p>
<h3>熊劍東夫人領回外勳　王弟弟在滬遇親　無人認領大小兩屍體　至此方知是其父及妹</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕當世上多少人正在聖誕節夜狂雞歡的時候，中航公司一一五號機，却在雨霧中墜毀在滬閔公路第三號橋附近，河塔廟右側水塘中。大小四十一人中，卅四人死亡，六人受傷，獨有這四歲的『幸運兒』王弟弟安然無恙，你是否覺得這是奇蹟？看照片，那是一個參麼可愛的孩子！</p>
<p>前幾天，爲了沒有家屬來領，所以由中航公司暫時寄養在中山醫院裏。到昨天下午二時四十五分，已由他的姨母唐奕君女士，認領出院了。</p>
<p>唐女士就是熊劍東夫人，亦就是王弟弟在上海唯一的親屬。她從報上看　了消息，同時公司方而亦有通知給她，所以昨天上午就趕到中山醫院探望她的幸運的外甥。唐女士拿出了一張她第弟弟婦及姪男合攝的照片給王弟弟看，問他「這是什麼人？」聰明的王弟弟一一回答說：」是舅舅，媽媽和表哥。」他們都一起住在重慶，所以王弟弟都認識。然而面對來領他同家撫養的姨媽，却感到十分的陌生。</p>
<p>唐女士的妹妹唐奕璋廣西人，妹丈王根發是蘇州人，這次帶領了王弟弟和王弟弟的妹妹一共四人，從重慶來上海，如今飛機失事，四人中祇剩下了王弟弟一人活着。唐女士吿訴記者說：　沒有見過王根發，所以在殯儀館祇認出了王弟弟母親唐奕璋的屍體。他父親和妹妹是那一個，祇好帶同王弟弟自己去認了。但是後來因爲王弟弟身體不大舒服，結果沒有去，而中國殯儀館所停放遇難者的屍體，亦衹有一大一小尙無人認領。經研究之下，確是王弟弟的父親王根發和王弟第的妹妹兩人，所以昨天下午便都已入殮了。</p>
<p>中航公司爲了愼重起見，請唐奕君女士寫了保單等一切手續辦淸楚後，四歲的王弟弟亦就跟他陌生的姨母坐上了一六三三四號的自備汽車，離開了中山醫院，住到愚園路他姨母家裏。在那裏有他許多表兄弟作陪，將不會再感到寂寞了！</p>
<p>在醫院裏，看護小妣問這四歲的孩子：「你爸爸呌什麼？」他回答說：「呌王爸爸」「爸爸在什麼地方？」「在重慶·」「媽媽呢？」他撅起小嘴，搖了搖頭，沒有同答。這可憐的孩子沒有知道他已經永遠失掉了父親，失掉了母親，失掉了妹妹，他不知道已經身歷一塲大難，亦不知道自己是唯一的幸運兒，他還祇是呌名四歲，但願他快樂的長大後，腦際不再存有這些血淋淋的故事！多少人在說着「大難不死，必有後福」，願這在聖誕節夜遇難而又得救的「小天使」，上帝將祝福他永遠快樂！</p>

<h3>參議會建議改善經濟　行政院電復解釋六點</h3>

<p>燃料管制　權宜之計</p>
<p>六，取銷煤斤管制一項，醒復員初期，主要礦區多被破壞，存煤極少，生產不足，政府始採用管制辦法，以扶助生產，協助解決東南各省之公用事業。鐵路。船舶及各種工業用煤之困難。至市民家庭炊事取暖所用之白煤塊與焦炭，則不在管制之一內，商民均可自由　銷，惜此項管制辦法，係屬權宜之計，一俟產運情况改善，自可將上海区　料管理委員會　　，響電知　」。</p>
<h3>二次大會　開始報到</h3>

<h3>絲織業年賞問題　七天與一月之差　社避希望勞工讓步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先就絲綢業年賞問題發表談話稱，『絲織業有百分之十五以上，處境甚爲危殆，其勉强維持者，無非希望能藉生產貸款之力量，渡過目前之難關。勞方目提出年賞要求後，社會局三次調停，現資方已同意七天，勞方則堅持非一月不可。但七天年賞已須使絲織業仲出十四億元，一個月之要求事實上將無法負担。本人深盼勞方能覺悟「殺鷄求蛋」之非計，接受七天之數目，否則社會局在必要時將予以裁定。』</p>
<h3>旅業勞資糾紛　評繼會已裁定</h3>
<p>吳局長同時宣布，旅館業勞資糾紛，昨經勞資糾紛評斷委員會栽定如下：（一）薪工部份，採用「基薪折成制」，工人薪水之百分之八十，爲職員之生活保障，不論營業情形如何，必需按月發給。其餘之百分之四十，則視旅館之營業成績，計算職工薪水。（二）解僱金，參照評斷委員會之工廠解僱工人辦法，以服務時間之長短，定解僱金之多少，最多不得超過三個月。（三）保證金退回問題。依照本年一月廿四日警察局謂解筆錄第六條親定，工人解僱時，保證金以原總數退回，另發紅利一至二月。又訊：社會局現規定，凡勞資爭議，經該局召集調停，無論何方代表三次不到，將予以缺席栽定。但召集書無法投遞者，不在此限。</p>
<h3>華聯輪今日啓椗　載猶僑駛返澳洲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中聯公司聯輪，現由猶僑繼會租貨，載猶僑返澳洲。該輪巳於前日自差臨回滬，定今日載猶僑千餘人駛雪梨。至澳後即加修理，返滬約須一月之久。招商局海航輪修復，定今日駛廈門。又海列輪於本月二十一日自滬駛暹，昨日抵盤谷。太古公司湖南輪，今日下午二時起椗，離滬駛津，除香港原船貨過津外，本市貨客一律不載。</p>
<h3>男女服毒兩起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚十一時，西寶興路嚴家閣榮祥里七號，有少婦嚴愛鳳，廿五歲，服毒自殺。幸經人發覺，車送公濟醫院醫治。聞自殺原因，因其夫投機失敗，夫婦閒發生口角所致。又北　　路二七八號亦有男子黃貴民一名，因經濟壓迫，吞金自殺。</p>
<h3>東亞又一樓述業　勞資糾紛調解中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東　一樓於　騰　　州　起之勞資料紛案，輕社會局應解，已獲趨步解決，於昨日下午三時由資方將大門　匙會同警察局派員　予勞方代表，將樓門開啓，暫允　工入內食宿。勞方代表昨並向新聞界雜吿此次停業之原因及經過。現職工方面提出四項要求：（一）從速復工，（二）發放十一十二兩月薪資客賞及全部公積金，（三）開放酒樓部大門，（四）在復工前供給爲食薪金。據悉社曾局允於明日再度逮集雙方會商。</p>
<h3>增稅不如整稅　參議員對市府預算之意見　認為市已無服勞役之義務</h3>
<p>市政府三十六年度預算，經各局處審核編製結果，歲出計達二千三百億餘元，爲平衡收支不敷起見，市府將房捐附征市政建設捐公用事業附征市政捐兩項，按照三十五年度秋季稅率列入臨時歲入項內，此外，並在收入項目下新增義務勞動代役金四百億元，合計八百六十八億餘元，業已將是項預算送往參議會。記者特分訪各參議員徵求對該預算這意見，各議員幾一致表示：對另設臨時收入部份，以補稅課收入額這不足，實不敢茍問，在本會第一次大會時，所允暫時增收市政建設捐及公用事樂捐，為以本年度爲限，並未准延列於明年之預算中，况在明年之新预算中，又復增添義務勞動代役金，更屬不當，况最近國大通過之憲法中，使規定人民有服兵役之義務，而無服勞役之義務，故是項捐稅更不可成立，並謂：增稅不整稅，希望市府少增新稅，努力整理原有稅收，使稅額增多即是矣，由此觀之，此閒題將成該會第二次大會中熱烈討論之一大問題。</p>
<h3>騎巡隊夜遇伏盜　林肯路雙方開槍　大隊警員包團搜索</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西郊上新涇分局稽境內，還來每至深晚，時時匪徒出沒，市警局特訓令該分局長張珍加派巡邏隊，日夜出勤，並侌騎巡隊輪流梭巡。昨晚八時許，騎巡隊十餘人，巡至林肯路新涇分局周家橋分駐所林肯路守望亭西首的百碼之遙，兩旁溝中伏有盜匪十餘名，拔搶開放七八響。其時騎巡隊警士，亟下馬還槍追擊，達十餘響之多，一時子彈橫飛。常塲有馬二匹中彈受傷，並有五五八八號警士斯正校（廿四歲諸紅曁人），四六二一號警士將奇（廿四歲安徽人）跌傷，後經送入警察醫院施治。事後匪徒竟敢又入同路二五〇號新生牧塲，意圖搶刧，幸經該塲致電守望亭報吿，由李巡長率警多名趕往，一面報吿新涇分局及總局，未幾總局刑事警察處飭全班警員紛乘警備車數輛，又有摩托車隊，義警刑事警察大隊分隊長鄭又宸，率組長張天安隊員六名，新涇分局，長寗警局，亦出動大批警員，並由刑事處長張師，分局長紅珍，先後抵達，把守要隘。警士三步一崗，五步一哨，由林肯南路至虹橋路北，中山路西復至古北路東，周團約三里之間，嚴密包團。另派一部份斡警　入各村莊挨戶搜抄，不使盜匪漏綱，直至今晨一時半，尚在搜索中。據張分局長語記者稱：該輩匪徒有一麻子及一駝背者，率領羽冀二十餘名，備有長短軍器，騷憂虹橋新涇諸雀等處，已有半月之久，殊堪痛恨，故務須予以殲減云。</p>
<h3>國貨展覧商場　商店一度停業</h3>
<p>國貨展覽商塲，昨因新成警局派員前往該塲上海絨綫公司，查扣貨物，引起全體參加廠商誤會，一度停業，後經雙方解釋，除關於上海機綫公司部份靜候依法蟒理外，各廠商當即照常營業。</p>
<h3>車輛過江　籌設輪渡　疏通浦東西貨運　碼頭地點已擇定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市輪渡公司鋻於本市物資應集，浦西貨棧已不敷容納，而浦東貨棧，則以交通關係，未能充份利用，故樓板籌備車輛　江　渡·據悉現已擇定兩岸　　地點，浦西爲陸家浜支路，浦東爲兩蔴頭路。</p>
<p>據該公司工程師慮賓候告記者稱，目前所選擇之地點，並非最合理想，而係兩岸地畝問題最簡單，易於辦到者。兩岸碼頭岸綫約長八十公尺，碼頭及船隻均與岸綫平行，過渡車輛經固定引橋及活動吊橋，由船首或船尾登陸。此頂輪站設計，歷經工程專家研討，始獲決定，係以經濟·便利·安全爲原則。</p>
<p>關於兩岸陸上交通，浦西尙無問題，沛東則僅能勉强通達大道，故該公司希望市政當局將來能修建一條新路。</p>
<p>至於輸濃，擬向物資供應局請購登陸艇二艘。每艘每次可載車輛十部左右，每日可渡運七八百輛。預計明年三四月可以完成。</p>
<p>車輛過江輪渡，除此綫外，該公司尙擬在虹口方面開關第二航綫，浦西地點爲關州路，浦東爲西渡。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕上海市輪渡公司獲於中山東路水上飯店南側，建築一現代化旅客輪站，分上下二層，內有電報·電話·郵政·旅行社·餐館等設備。浦東陸秋驅路，亦擬興築一類似之輪站。</p>
<h3>捲烟廠聯合要求　制止怠工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市二十餘家捲烟廠資方代表，於昨日下午六時赴社會請願，要求制止工人之意工行動。據某代表告記者。捲烟業之年賞，經局方批准爲長工一個月工資，件工及臨時工爲每年總所得之百分之八。但工人之要求，自二三月至四五個月，漫無標準。且因廠方不願接受，已實行怠工，每日生產量僅爲平日十分之一左右，以致損失不貲。故特集體請願，請社會局了以有效之制止。又年賞問題必須各廠一併解決，個別妥協決非上策。</p>
<h3>本市簡訊</h3>
<p>南陽橋市立第二宰牲塲，市府衛生局決予改善。已委派許世琛博士接長該塲。</p>

<h3>敵憲米村春喜　邀功晉級大興寃獄　全部案情已明　明日即可判決　軍庭昨再開審被害家屬陳述經過　「常熟之狼」難逃一死</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「常熟之狼」敵憲米村容喜昨晨由第一綏靖區軍事法庭陸起法官開庭審訊，至下午一時餘始畢。該案現已近結束階段，將於明日下午一時再開會議庭會審後即可判決。屆時並將由中央電影攝影塲攝成電影。</p>
<p>米村春喜係常熟敵憲兵隊隊長，在職期間惡行搖於鄕里。三十二年間，米村爲圖邀功晋級，竟大興寃獄，在常熟太倉一帶濫施逮據當地民衆六千餘人，一部份後經釋放，尙有三千餘人則從此生死不明。勝利後米村經當局逮捕，送由軍事法庭迭加審訊，該犯狡辭圖賴，諉稱其中二十七人送交上海軍法會議，尙有五人則送至當地縣立醫地。軍事法庭爲此曾派員赴常熟當地調查詳情，並發捆被害屍骨，證實米村所供全屬謊言，乃於昨日再行開庭。</p>
<h3>臉色紅潤　神態自然</h3>
<p>米村昨衣草綠色軍服，披草綠色大衣，頗爲聲齊挺括，背上掛軍用水壺一隻，臉色紅潤，神態自然，幾令人不信其爲待決之囚犯，而懷疑其之獄中生活是否仍極優裕。此人臉部尙無獰惡之狀，惟極露狡猾。　陸法官首傳自虞太來滬作證之被害人家屬陸大綬，汪學鈞，陳金華，黃覺，鄭沛雲妻等，略問一過後。即根據在常熟調查前在縣立醫院中任職之醫師護士管理員及曾任翻譯之陸某所述各點向米村嚴辭質詢，其內容大致可歸納如下：</p>
<h3>質詢暴行　歸納四點</h3>
<p>（一）米村否認曾有暴行，但據前縣立醬院中人證明几由憲兵隊送進醫院之病人，大都皆受刑傷，步履維艱。</p>
<p>（二）米村供稱葉振飛等五人因病送至醫院後身故，屍身由家屬認領，但事實上凡由憲兵隊送至醫院之病人不論死亡或痊愈，均仍由憲兵隊掩理或領回。</p>
<p>（三）米村大興寃獄之原因，爲圖邀功晋級，故事先將憲兵隊隔壁楊姓房屋拆毀建造牢房四座，而獻計者爲一王姓翻譯。勝利後（翻譯自知罪大惡極，哭訴米村資助汽車財物後逃匿。</p>
<p>（四）縣立醫院管理員陳雲洲證實當年大施逮捕後，有不少受刑傷之病人遂進醫院，死者均由敵憲於午夜車至北門外掩埋，且禁止旁人觀看。渠並目睹有顧姓桑姓兩人，受傷而死。</p>
<h3>骷髏四具　帶上法庭</h3>
<p>米村對於以上各點，仍支吾其詞，或稱並無其事，或稱係其下屬所爲，但陸法官侃侃而述，事實俱在，不容該犯再施狡辯矣。</p>
<p>前該庭主任書記官李業初自常熟發掘帶回之被害骷髏四具，昨亦陳置於法庭牆角，但並未出示米村。</p>
<p>據悉米村案將以軍法殺人及濫施職權之罪判決，當難逃一死云。</p>

<h3>黑次澤男等兩犯偵查完畢已起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日本戰犯黑澤次男及川添長次郞兩人，業經第一綏靖區軍事法庭偵查完學提起公訴。</p>

<p>川添長次郞係本市滬西憲兵隊隊長，民國三十四年五月一日曾誘捕我方市黨部三十三分部情報組長陳鳳祥，用棍打，灌水，跪鐵罐等非刑逼供，致陳腿部受傷，積久未痊。同年五月六日又逮捕平民辛志鴻，誣爲抗日劇本著作人，加以灌水之刑，因辛以屏氣法拒吸，該犯即以燃燒之香烟置於辛之腹上使其不能屏氣，以致傷痕纍纍。勝利後匿居集中營，經蒙難同志會指認時認出。</p>

<h3>統一計算棉紗生產成本　決定會計科目五項　各廠分別計算后提交紡管會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會日前會議時，對收購棉紗價格，決定另按目前各項生產成本，另　新價。昨日上午十時，國民營紗廠各推會計財務統計方面之人員多人，會集江西路紡建公司會議室，共商計算生產成本之各項會計科目。紡管會李副主委及業務處長劉文騰亦出席。會議至下午一時許始散。當決定統一計軍棉紗生產成本之會計科目五大項，計：一。原料·二。工資。三。製造費用。四。財務費用。五·業務費用。其中製造費用，尙分物料，折舊，職工福利，動力，修繕費等項目。國民營紗廠將分別按該批統一項目，計算各自之生產成本，俾便提交紡管會會議席上通過云。</p>
<h3>複製業一致希望　棉紗供應須有規律</h3>
<p>第四期第四次配紗，牽延一星期，仍以價格須重行議定未有確訊，據複配會負責人潘士浩氏語人，棉紗之應爲有規律的供應，誠爲複製各業之切盼，但偶然的延期，與配價之重議，均不足成為嚴重之問題云，關於紡管會最近所決定之棉紗管制新辦法，據溢氏表示，此係有關社會民生之普遍問題，並非政府與紗廠業間之單純問題，新辦法在表面上，似係雙方讓步，而其對於將來棉紗之供應，及紗價之上落，則相信紡管會將在社會民生上作鄭重之考慮，潘氏並指稱，自九月份以來，紗管政策已三度變更，新辦法也許仍爲試騐性質，且紡管會對於向紗廠收購之棉紗，將如何處置，以及紗廠業對於保留部份，將如何供應，其詳細辦法，當然尙待商議，複製業於此，願重申棉紗供應須有規律之主張，氏昨曾透露消息，複配會前己有意見書提供紡管會，主張複製工業用紗，應有半數爲固定性之定期配售，半數爲彈性之臨時發售，務使需供二方，都得　規律，以免獨占者摧斷，投機者猖獗，至對於棉紗出口易取外匯一點，複配會主張複製業可領紗代製，以成品輸往南洋云。</p>
<h3>紗市堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益臻穩定，客胃雖未轉暢，人心已見堅挺，廿支十六支各牌續升一萬至四萬，卅二支細紗，因靑津來貨不多，粵帮有意搜買，價乃扶搖直上，如卅二支五彩星由昨日之二百七十萬直竄至二百八十二萬，尙少供售，四十二支亦俏，跟漲十萬之譜。</p>
<h3>公債平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨雜牌微回，統丙尙形平和，晨開一三八〇元，誠德及五〇三室來進，回升至一四九〇元左右，結果較前收微升二十元，甲乙回降五十元，統丁統戊各降二十元，成交的四百萬元。</p>

<h3>倒風波及茶市</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，向銷非洲之陳珠茶，本市某茶葉公司雖有進胄，惜貨稀供缺，交易寥落零星，他若抽珍，珍眉等花色，脫手猶吿轉聯。其他各茶過程大都與上日相仿。</p>
<p>際此茶銷滯呆中，若干固業復受「高利貸」壓迫，頗有不勝担負之苦，不久以前，杭州茶行受其襲擊，倒閉者達四十餘家，同時蘇州天津倒閉者，聞亦不少，近悉此風漸已波及本市，最近數日，已有數家停歇，若再任其猖獗，繼起者恐益將增加云。</p>
<h3>呢羢成交有限</h3>
<p>毛織物呢羢，昨日茶會及棋盤街大批發號，零躉成交均皆有限。因年底迫近，銀根抽緊，兼以講倒之風盛熾，與一切環境關係，所有賣買，俱欲現鈔，同時實銷已成尾聲，民衆購買力銳减，拆息暗盤愈做愈高，一般稍有實力之店號，大半俱願暫停數日，靜待年關過去再說。故各種貨價以春季花呢趨勢最秀，大衣呢類賡續下游，麥爾登前因許可證與報關手續延綏而上漲，昨則成有大批出到，標準巳由四萬二千元下落至三萬九千元矣。</p>
<h3>金價起落靡定　美鈔較前稍挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨續吿萎靡，買戶仍難振作，臨收復趨下降，晨開三二八萬，開後形勢不定，求供　忽，且經營者買賣價拔開軍遠，忽起忽落，先升至三三四萬，略有壓力，十時左右降至三二五萬，央行即以此價配給四一條，入後供源稍止，買風又起，會漲高到三四四萬，經過央行壓迫後，仍難前進，於是散買迫於銀根，復有了結，午刻降至三三〇萬光景，午後見低至三二一萬光景，而後稍穩，最後在三二八萬至三三〇萬之閒，較前收微升一萬，節金三十五萬元，銀元再升，暗息仍在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣昨未見活潑，美鈔暗市晨初六四〇〇元左右高價見六六〇〇元，午後金市慘降，曾報低為六〇〇〇元至六二〇〇元，最後六三〇〇元有售，結果較前收跌落二百元左右，港票形勢呆滯，結果與前收相彷彿，港匯昨一二三〇元有售，成交仍少，印匯一五〇〇元，英匯一九八〇〇元，均無受主，美匯仍吿呆滯。</p>
<h3>行莊應儘量減收　客戶封簽鈔券　銀行公會負責人發表談話</h3>
<p>頃據銀行商業同業公會負責人談稱：本會近因鑒於市塲鈔券授受數量龐大，往往一戶有數千萬元之進出，此在授受雙方，事實無法檢點，不得已採用封簽辦法，然此種鈔券，如解入中央銀行，須由解款行重行加封，日後遇有短少，歸解款行負責，解款行於理論上原可轉向前手追補，似乎責任分明，無可推諉，但近頃事實表現，流弊重重，一因積時旣久，淸點不易，再則輾轉移轉，最後責任誰屬，不獨難以查考，亦復各執一詞，無從判斷，於是客戶與銀行間，此類糾紛，不一而足，狡黠者更用種種方法，乘機作弊，致封簽鈔券，有缺數達數十萬元之鉅者，長此以往，必至相互糾結，有不可收拾之一日，該項封簽辦法，本係就付　擠臨時權宜之計，茲旣弊竇業生，亟應改善，在治本方面，固須促進票據流通，减少通貨授受，治標方面，各行應先儘量减收客戶封簽鈔券，除特別信任者外，縱有人力物力之困難，隨時必須淸點，不宜積壓過久，以明彼此責任，同時本會己函請中央銀行，將積存之各行原封鈔券，迅爲檢點，藉免日後追徘無着，損失堪處云。</p>
<h3>原料市塲　年終休市　本年興衰幾度　歲尾暴利可觀</h3>
<p>原料市塲，昨日起交易已稀落，以時屆年邊，買賣雙方，均忙於年終結算，故市塲方面，頓時淸冷，行商門市交易，亦趨休市狀態。回顧本年原料商業，在一至四月份常中，一般行商營業頗爲繁榮，獲利亦頗可觀，新設行商，幾如雨後春筍，大多經營訂貨。五月以後，訂貨蜂湧而來，原料行商，亦趨向下坡。斯時原料進口商困難重重，如訂貨到埠，遙遙無期，貨款利息，不勝負荷，訂貨到時，競向推銷，價格低於國外之訂貨價值，加以行商所到之貨，廠商亦巳直接訂購，以致無法推銷，而他埠以交通梗阻，工業不振，原料淤塞滬地一隅，價格一貶再貶，百十歷史悠久之行商，幾皆瀕於垂危，新設行商，更無論矣，唯實力雄厚之公司，則任其貨如山積，靜待時機，但大多貸款經營者，其費金多爲國外訂貨所凍結，週轉不　，不得不將所有熱門貨眨價銷售，以償債務。迨至中秋以後，原料商行又呈峯迥路轉之况，此時本市各工廠，多數增產復工，而訂貨又以美國海員罷工，久無到埠，原料價格，蠕蠕向上。及至十一月下旬，工業原料，不論熟門貨，冷門貨，倘俐非常，熱門貨固漲風熾烈，冷門貨亦身價十倍，因此本年原料商業，皆可安渡年關，尤以十一二月份，所獲利益，相當優厚。</p>
<h3>取締投機漸收實効　當局監管愈益積極</h3>
<p>頃據金融界權威對記者謂：連日投機之風，經有關當局嚴密取締後，不穩現象，已漸過去，昨日票據交換情形，頗爲良好，交換時問，已蛟前兩日爲早，退票者亦不多，以此看來，大槪可望安渡年關，至於從事投機黑市之金號，除永興金號，昨已由財部轉令市府查封外，對於其餘各金號之管理，均較前嚴密，不使投機者匿跡其間，除由主管金融機關財政部，予以加强管理外，央行方面，亦極盡嚴厲監督之責，預料投機之騷動，即將彌平。</p>
<h3>銀根抽緊暗息高昂　華股掉期交易繁忙</h3>
<p>華股昨形恍忽，塲內交易純以掉期爲主，初時金融界投兵不動，以是掉期差價極鉅，永紗達三十五元以上，信和達十五元以上，合拆息達二角半以上，後有新華與業等前來維持，始稍軋擺，晨開見低，開後二二四號二二九號進現永紗，八五號九一號一九八號進遞交，逐漸盤升至六二五元以上，一五五號八九號六一號售出現永紗，七〇號四號二二九號則賣遞永紗、於是十時後跌至六〇四元，八九號趁低有補，一八〇號二二號一八五號二二四號一四號均進，金市見俏，遞永紗升至六四八元，現永紗升至六一一元外，九九號力售現永紗，二一八號二一五號一八五號一七二號一四五號陸續脫售，金價亦回，近午現永紗退至五八五元以下，但因二三三號八九號等咸有補進，午刻尙能回升，結果較前收計丞紗新光微升，信和景福勤興華豐徵降，美亞跌落半成，冷股絕少開做，火柴麗安景綸內衣微升，餘者少變化，遞交信和新光微升，信和美亞平平，華豐微挺，塲外各股尙形穩定。</p>
<p>外股交易淸稀，成交純僅怡紗英聯較多，金市由堅同疲，各股遂形微挫，結果較前收計業廣降半成弱，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>日紗運港　係為交換物資　售價與華紗相去不遠　第一批五千五百包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日紗貶價運港傾銷之事，紡織界迭有傳聞。記者昨特趨訪紡織界某鉅子，承吿：日紗運港一事，據渠所知，係香港政府向日本盟軍總師部所接洽訂購者。第一批數額爲五千五百包，大致在一月後，可運港銷售。惟查該批棉紗，係港政府與日本盟軍總師部辦理物物交換而來。港方提出交換者，爲食糖等物資。故棉紗成本若干，尙需視交換之物資成本如何而後定。惟戰後英美對棉紗市價，有所謂世界市價（World　price）之擬定。以四百磅二十支棉紗爲標準，每件價爲美金二百五十元。此所以預防各國將棉紗在世界市塲上作貶價之傾銷也。故預料該批日紗在港銷售之價格，當不致在世界市價之下。如依此比例計算，則日紗與華紗之距離，當不致過大。且戰後日本產紗所用之原棉，俱係獲自美國方面之多年陳棉。故棉紗品質，並不理想。而港政府採購此批日紗，目的常係在穩定港地紗價。一切管制設施，當必相當嚴密。故即使將來日紗在港之銷售價，稍康於華紗而可能走私之數量，當甚微少云。　又訊，據棉紗某權威方面吿稱：關於日紗運銷香港，須待明年一月始可開始啓運，其首批總額爲五萬五千件，限三個月運畢，前傳是項日紗，每包價格僅合法幣八十萬元，現據該某估計，至少亦須港幣一千五百餘元。</p>

<h3>天津進出口業　陷於停頓狀態</h3>
<p>〔聯合社天津廿七日電〕據天津主要商行之一華北貿易公司稱：過去一個月中天津進出口業已陷入停頓狀態中，一部份由於國外貿易規則之修改，一部份由於華北之混亂局勢。遵照新訂章則，進口寶之登記事宜尙在進行中，故政府當局倚未發出輸入許可證，目前准許輸入之商品僅有人造染料，頗料，亞麻，呢誠匹頭，印刷材料，門留玻璃，及繩子油，論值僅約美金二千元。</p>
<h3>倫敦市塲中國債券　引起投機興趣</h3>

<h3>市立中學敎職員代表　昨晨晉謁吳市長　市長允預借薪水半月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市立中學敎職員聯誼會，以市校敎職員待遇菲薄，生活艱苦，曾於本月二十二日（星期日），召開第九次全體大會時，向市府當局請求調整待遇，提出五項要求，尙均未得要領。彼等近以年關轉瞬即屆，生活實無以維持，除一致決定將於一月六日實行總　假外，特推派奚楨壅，李獻章，張志華，顧日三，朱烈等五人爲代表，於昨日（廿八日）上午十時半，由敎育局長顧毓琇陪同，再度普謁吳市長，堅持下列三項要求：（一）請速發寒衣費每人五十萬元，（二）中央調整公務員待遇明令尙未到達時，准予暫借薪金一月，（三）請按月十日以前發薪。</p>
<p>寒衣費問題　對於寒衣費五十萬元一節，吳市長表示無先例可援，自難照辦，且本市公務員總數以十萬人計，每人五十萬元，則需總數一百五十億元，市府根本無從籌款，對於四行兩局之撥發寒衣費，認爲業務機關與行政機關，應有所區別，故不能混爲一談。吳市長表示市校敎師之請求，可以保留，若本國任何一地，有此辦法時，則吳市長亦必設法做到。</p>
<p>借月薪問題　至於借薪一月一項，吳市長已與財政局谷局長經過一番商酌，決定於本月卅一日，預借薪水半個月，並於一月十五日前，即舊曆年關之內，撥發一月分之薪金。又中央調整公務員待遇之明令，恰於廿七日公佈，據代表等表示，調整後之薪金，約增加百分之六十，惟其總數仍不超過四十萬云。</p>
<p>發薪期問題　按月於十日前發薪問題，吳市長表示，並非當局拖延，而純由於市財政局於十日之前，尙無收入，一切稅收，最早須俟十五日始可繳入，故對於市校敎師之薪金，只得於可能範圍內，促其墾前。</p>
<p>關於眞茹，楊思等郊區市校，三個月未發薪水一事，吳市長表示，不在渠之責任以內，恐純係審計處手續遲純所致，巳由敎育局正副局長保證請其按月發放。</p>
<p>總請假問題　吳市長對於市校敎職員，將於一月六日德請假一節，認為不妥，因身為人師，應當顧到身份，自不能以罷敎作威脅，恐不易獲得社會人士及一般知識階級之同情也。並囑今後有任何行動時，須事先向吳市長及顧局長取得運絡，吳市長表示並非不同情市校敎師，實因我國整個經濟未上軌道之前，亦無能爲力云。</p>
<p>本市市校敎師是否將於一月六日實行總請假，代表等亦難逆料，須俟一月五日之第十次全體會員大會中，作最後決定。</p>
<p>又彼等近正擬具提案，企圖向第二次市參議會作最後之呼籲，蓋上决市參會中，曾有會商改善，以公平合理原則，調整市校敎職員待遇之決定。</p>

<p>第二塲女子組繼之開始，體專女生對的翰，裁判張覺非，的翰球員服裝鮮明，修飾齊整，並有男同學啦啦隊助威，然經不起壯健之體專女子一擊。唯昨日體專戰來，亦少精彩，致分數相差極近，結果爲十七比八。</p>
<p>約翰男生　大勝震旦</p>
<p>壓軸戰約翰對震旦，裁判楊列誠袁其蔡，的翰身體魁梧，　日則多矮小，且的翰有恩卡斯之鮑萊出任中鋒，益以祝明星，吳新運準確之射籃，一路領先，震旦遠非其敵，上半時約翰以三十一比八佔絕對優勢。易陣調將再戰，吳新運又首先開路，祝明星陶瑩石屢建奇功，震旦矮脚虎陳伯涵，數次進進襲，均未得逞，結果約翰以五十八比十五大勝震旦。</p>

<h3>血！火！淚！　察北一幕大慘劇　崇禮屠城記　家家有死者　戶戶有哭聲</h3>
<p>— 張家口二十日訊　本報記者　竭忠</p>
<p>正當國大會議開的如火如茶，商談民主筆政，保障人民自由的時候，察省崇禮縣，共軍約血手，導演出了一幕駭人的屠殺人民的慘劇。這個現實的對照，該是多麼刺心的圖畫！</p>
<p>崇禮慘案，儀空氣那樣普遍地流傳於察省，傳於全國，這幾天，張家口的人民，變的更加深沉。在生活的重壓下，又蒙上恐怖的陰影。街頭巷尾傳說着共軍屠殺的悽慘，逃來的難民，哭訴經過的兇險。二十日的下午，張家口市民爲崇禮縣死難同胞舉行隆重的追悼，十七萬顆人心，都湧起激憤的怒潮，當被難者的慘象呈現在人民的眼簾時，髮指毗裂，悲憤塡胸，凡是還有人類同情心的人，誰不爲之戰慄腦寒？</p>
<p>石司令以下　全部官兵殉難</p>
<p>事實的經過是這樣的：十二月九日那天，共軍以三旅兵力，萬餘之衆，進攻崇禮縣城，因爲守軍衆寡懸殊，警戒疏忽，自石司令玉山以下，全部殉職。當地還鄉隊及民衆二百餘，據守天主敎堂，整整打了一天，直到午後，共軍用砲火將敎堂焚燒，一幕慘絕人寰的大屠殺從此開始。</p>
<p>崇禮縣七百多個不幸的農民，盡成了俘虜，一串一串被捆綁着，走到一條街頭，殺上二三十個，他們要以殺人來示威洩憤，最後將剩餘的三百餘人，擁到東南城角，一起用機槍掃射。</p>
<p>在敎堂的一角，發現有十餘塊燒焦的殘肢，據說就在這所房子裏，八十多個老百姓成了灰燼。</p>
<p>敎堂孤兒院　處處慘痛景象</p>
<p>十五日當記者視察國進入崇禮的時候，焚燬了的敎堂，還散放烟雲，隨地是緋紅的血跡，凍僵的屍首，到處是慘痛的哭嚎，凄楚的哀呼。</p>
<p>記者進入敎堂僅存的孤兒院內，逢見兩個找不到丈夫屍體歸來的少婦，站立着，凝視着，木然不動似在向上帝哀訴。幾位白衣的外籍修女，流着眼淚，用着生硬的中國話泣訴：「這一次……這一次……人殺啦，堂燒了，東西都搶光了！孤兒院的房子，已放好了柴火，正準備燒，孩子們跪下哀求了半天，才留下……」一百多個可憐的小生命——從幾個月到八九歲的孤兒，捧着手，流着淚：「你們不要走，多留幾個兵吧，我們怕！」悲慘的呼聲像針像　，刺痛着每個人的神經。</p>
<p>鄭忠懷隊長　全家都被慘殺</p>
<p>自衛隊長鄭忠懷，全家被慘殺，共達十二口之多。</p>
<p>從共軍大屠殺中倖免的僅有的一個公務員，是縣政府的秘書張鍵，他對記者這樣說：「這次共軍對我們崇體縣的人民殺得太慘了！就地剝去衣服殺死的大人小孩及老弱婦女，總在五百以上，迎失踪的不下兩千，女人哭丈夫，老漢哭兒子，孩子喊爹娘，無論白晝晚間，總是一片哭喊聲……」</p>
<p>共軍在屠殺之後，將所有的財物都擄掠走，甚至連沒有做成的鞋底都拿走，死者不能安葬，活着無衣無食，他們都瞪着血絲的眼睛，要向魔鬼們索命！</p>
<p>從記者攝取的鏡頭中，讀者自會看到祟禮慘案的斷片，讓它們來訴說出所謂進步的民主的政黨的罪惡吧！</p>
<p>十餘歲小孩　被投入了火坑</p>
<p>崇禮縣被段的軍民，不過千餘條性命，這在今天到處朝伐斯殺動輒傷亡數萬的時代，並不算一個可驚的數字。慘案本身所以嚴重，不僅死的多，尤其死的慘。不是戰塲上的傷亡，而是戰鬥結束後有計劃的屠殺，尤其對付那些失掉戰鬥力的士兵，無事的老幼婦孺，竟遭這採的凌戮？使我們不明白如何出此狠毒的心腸！</p>
<p>一個外國神父這樣說：「我今年已六十多歲，傳敎亦四十多年，兩次世界大戰我都經過了，從沒有見過這樣慘痛恐懼的景象，殺了神父，燒了敎堂，二百多民衆都被活活的燒死，一位十幾歲的孩子，逃了出來，又被投進火坑，這是多麼慘忍！」原來，共軍在這裏創造出了殺人的藝術！</p>
<p>街頭一女屍　兩眼挖成黑洞</p>
<p>在縣城的一道街旁，橫躺着一具女屍，乳房鼻子被割去，眼睛成了兩個黑洞，赤身裸體，膠着在凍結的血泊裏。</p>
<p>另一個青年，手足襪釘在樹幹上，臂腿掛在樹枝上，血泥漿還沒有掩蓋掉臉上痛苦的表情。七十多歲的老頭兒，腦漿被砸碎，生殖器被割掉，兩條瘦得皮包骨的臂膀，還向後緊緊的綁着。</p>
<p>恐怖悲慘籠罩着崇禮，家家有死者，戶有哭聲，人間地獄，無逾於此！</p>
<p>共軍在崇禮縣的尾殺，給人們一個印象：赤色恐怖開始了，這幕悲劇可能愈演愈慘！假定共產黨還要講革命的話，革命的基礎總不該脫離羣衆，軍事上的努力，彌補不了政治上的失敗，喪失了的民心，更不能以恐怖報復手段來脅迫，人民固然是弱者，但當不能屈辱忍讓，運生命都要被剝奪的時候，憤怒的火焰會毀滅掉任何壓迫勢力的！</p>
<h3>揮淚話封邱（一）</h3>
<p>— 開封十九日航訊本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>封邱像一面鏡子，在鏡子裏你可以看到無限凄冷，悲慘，險惡，恐怖的險影，但同時你也可以看到無限緊張，興奮，蓬勃，光明的事物。</p>
<p>封　一間沒有關窗的暖室，在這裏你可以嚐到砭人肌骨的寒風，同時你可以享到春天的溫暖。</p>
<p>封邱在苦難中，封邱在進步中，封邱在苦難中進步，封邱在進步中受着苦難，什麼時候他能擺脫苦難，他立刻就可以成爲新中國的一角。</p>
<p>封邱——這個沙邱中的小縣，對於他，我是只有一個平淡，貧困，蕭條，落漠的想像。這一個荒凉平淡的地方，在夢中我也沒有想去過，但，一個意外的機會，終於使我到了這個未來新中國的一角，而且有二十四個小時的停留，在道二十四個小時裏，我看到了不少的事事物物，我也發見了不少新的課題，我不像以前那樣漠視這裏，道塊地方將永不能使我忘記，我願他不久的將來能成個沙漠中的綠洲，我也願將他現在的容姿描繪出來。</p>
<p>憂患小城　十六號下午兩點鐘，沙土飛揚中，兩輛吉普和一輛小轎車，載着我們開封的十一個新聞記者，（除記者和大公報的李辛霖先生外，其餘都是開封的記者）駛進封邱，在疾馳如飛的車上，我們遠遠看到了一座殘破的城門樓，城門外排了一列長蛇似的隊伍，雖然平日人家以「無冕王」來稱譽我們，但我們自己却從來沒有敢這樣自高身價過。</p>
<p>車停了，一羣人擁住了我們那是駐在封邱的第五綏靖區司令部的胡參謀長，政治部陳主任，司令部雷副官處長，劉縣長，劉議長，縣黨部賈書記長，靑年團龍書記，該縣省參議員王法平先生，大家交換了名片，緊緊的握了手，徒步向城內去。軍樂響了，在雄壯悠揚的軍樂聲中，我們以感慚交併的心情，經過了二里長的隊伍之前。他們是五綏靖區直屬部隊和司令部全體官佐，滑縣聯中，簡師，中正學校，中心學校，警察局，縣政府所屬各機　。最使人注意的，是那一列人民隊伍，他們穿着長袍，肩上挎着大刀，手裏持着長矛，行列是那樣整齊，精神是那樣飽滿。當我們走過他們面前時，他們以目迎目送，使我們感到萬分的興奮和難過，「我們將以什麼來答謝他們呢？」我們內心裏這樣自問着。　在緊張的旋律中，我們踏進了這座飽經憂患的小城，城內狹窄的街道上，衆目睽睽，都奇異的注視着我們這一羣衣冠不整的人物，我們看看他們，又看看滿街的壁報和標語：「新聞記者是人民的喉舌」，「新聞記者是社會的導師」，「歡迎新聞記者給我們指導批評」，「新聞記者來封邱能給我們光明能减我們痛苦」，「……」沉重的担子和殷切的希望，越發使我們感覺到不安，我們究竟能替他們說些什麼？我們究竟能替他們做些什麼？在這樣受之有愧的情形之下，我們不自禁的對自己的力量發生了疑問。</p>
<p>一臉塵土，剛剛被政治部的幾盆熱水洗去之後，政治部的陳生任遠湘和地方各界事前爲我們擬定好的一張程序單拿出來了，那程序是這樣的，十六日下午三時，由政治部陳主任歡宴，四時訪晤孫司令官，四時半訪問各機關學校，六時孫司令官歡宴，六時半歡迎晚會，（司令部幼年兵隊演國劇）次日晨七時參加聯合朝會演講，八時早餐，八時半地方然政團座談會，十一時地方各界聯合公宴，十二時軍事座談會，下午二時歡送。</p>
<p>排好了的節目，不容我們不接受，大家就在政治部吃了陳主任一餐，接着我們就由陳主任陪同去訪候綏靖區司令官孫震上將。　孫震上將，是近來中共方面認爲孤獨悲哀的人物，說他是目前四川軍人中唯一的帶兵官，他有無限的苦悶和牢騷，中央對他一向是歧視的，他已走向悲哀的道路。　這個身經百戰，功在國家，從隨蔡松坡起義一直在革命序列中以作戰勇猛而被稱爲小「覇王」的老將軍，抗戰期間，轉戰魯豫鄂七載，拱衛陪都門戶，奠定勝利基礎，早前走馬解開封之圍，此次揮戈定封滑之亂，到如今會悲哀苦悶嗎？在到司令部去的途中，我這樣想着。</p>
<p>剛走進孫將軍的院子，孫將軍就和他的董副司令官笑着迎了出來。孫將軍，一個五十多歲的淸秀人物，那輻溫文爾雅的丰采，如果不是他項下帶着三星上將的領章，穿一身戎裝，誰也想不到這就是統率千軍萬馬，用血淚和智勇爲中華民國寫過不少光榮歷史的孫農上將，蔣主席譽他爲優秀純潔之模範軍人，李宗仁將軍尊他爲「武聖人」如今看來不是毫無原因的。</p>
<p>大家握過手，到了屋子裏，彼此寒暄了一陣，我們等他說話，他却老是那樣斯文文的坐着，好像羞見生客似的守口如瓶。大家坐了十分鐘，陳主任很知道孫將軍的脾氣，也明知道再坐下去，如果我們不問，他是不好意思多說話的，於是就代我們吿辭，到外邊去訪問各機關學校，而這時孫將軍却又有點依依不捨了。</p>
<p>瞻仰古井</p>
<p>出了司令部的後門是一片平靜的湖水，湖水的中央，是一個古老的水井，幾條小道由湖岸通到井邊，挑夫們正從這古井裏打水，三担担的往外挑。陳主任告訴我們這是一源古井，所謂翟母井就是指此而言，她的來歷是這樣的：據說漢高祖當年流亡的時候，曾經在這裏受過飢寒，當時有一位姓翟的老太太不忍坐視，曾經送給他一頓飯，後來漢高祖得帝位，想起這一飯之恩，就趕快到這裏來看這位老太太，可是這位老太太福薄命淺，她沒有等到漢高祖來報答她，她就寂寞的死了，漢高祖到了這裏，聞訊神傷，結果把這位老太太的境邱封了一下（封邱縣的命名就是由此而來的），同時又因爲翟老太太生前住在井邊，所以也就把這個井封爲翟母井了。我們走到井邊，看了許久，覺得索然無味，就順着往飛去的路走了。</p>
<p>幼年兵隊</p>
<p>翟母井往東，是一座雄偉的宅院，門口掛着一塊白木牌子，上邊寫着「第五綏靖區司令部幼年兵隊」，當我們走進門口時，一支幼年兵正在門口列隊歡迎我們，那支行列共有四十個人，最大約有十入歲，最小約有十三四歲，精神弈弈，儀容嚴肅，我們暗地裏喝了一聲采。走進門，我們參觀了他們整薺淸潔的內務，看了他們井井有條約敎室，大家都覺得非常滿意，雷處長和我們且走且說他設這支幼年兵，是在抗戰時期收容各地的難童，原來打算是專施以軍隊預備敎育，後來爲了要使他們的生活更愉快，同時也想以他們的生活情調來鼓舞士兵的情緒，所以除授以軍事敎育外，另外也使他們學點新舊劇，現在他們也學會了不少的京戲，這幾年值軍中精神糧食缺乏，他們確給士兵羣衆以無限的代用品。說着我們已走出了這院子，另到滑縣聯師了。</p>
<p>學校機關</p>
<p>省立滑縣聯中和封邱簡師，是一門兩櫃，共有學生七百十一人，聯中五百六十二人，簡師一百四十九人，各上各課，而敎師因爲待遇不同，所以兩個學校把敎師的待遇平均了一下，敎師就不分彼此的雙方互用了。舉生們在極艱苦中一點也不敢放鬆他們學習的機會，當我們在暮色蒼茫中進入他們學校的時候，有些同學還在黑暗的敎室中摸索着他們的功課。</p>
<p>出了滑縣聯中，經過正在修建中的中正公園，我們到了新近成立的中正學校，這個學校是爲了慶祝蔣主席六秩壽辰而獻出來的，從計劃。獻金。招生。開課，到現在還不到七十天，然而看看那經改造而成的富麗堂皇的校舍，和整齊劃一的敎具，我們眞有點驚奇了。宮殿式的校門，和河大的校門只是稍小了一點。寢室。敎室。綠柱紅窗。古香古色，異常壯麗，現有初中兩班，共八十八人，小學六班一百八十人。這是由五綏靖區和地方合辦的，據說雙十節那天才發起，司令部全體官兵捐獻兩千萬元，地方各界捐獻兩千萬元，就這樣四千萬元成立了這所規模宏大的學校。現在這裏校的學生，都舒服自在的上着課。另據該校負責人談稱：這四千萬元基金，建設費用去了一千萬元，設備費用去了一千萬元，下餘兩千萬元，現正擬購不動產，作該永遠基金。以上這個開支的數目如果是確實的話，這無形中說明了開封中正學院</p>
<p>天已墨子，急急忙忙我們去回年團我們也去了。</p>
<p>時間來不及，孫司令官的歡宴改到第二天上午九時，我們從參誶會出來就直接去參加幼年兵隊的歡迎晚會。</p>
<p>歡迎晚會</p>
<p>歡迎晚會是幼年兵隊在邊家院舉行的。舞台上倒也琳那滿目，只是用九輛太平軍所搭成的合子，確有點高低不平。晚會中唱了四齣京戲：大登殿，空城計，梅龍鎭三齣戲，唱做均佳，壓軸戲靠興府一齙，武工熟練老到，允非尋常見童劇團所能比上。六點半開始，九點半散戲，我們在愉快中看了三個鐘頭精彩的京戲，這才和孫司令長官握了手，回到招待所休息去了。</p>
<p>在招待所吃過了夜餐，陳主任遠湘還依依不捨的在和我們談天，大家好像久別重逢的老朋友一樣，滔滔不絕的談到十一點鐘多。</p>
<p>夜談英雄</p>
<p>從下午二時起，到夜裘十一點鐘止，我們都在緊張中旋轉着，招待我們的陳主任和副官處雷處長姜主任等，也在緊張的旋律中伴奏，大家一點也不覺得累，有的圍爐和雷處長談目前軍事，有的和美主任並膝談軍中文化，我却和陳主任燈下論英維。</p>
<p>「孫將軍就是這樣不肯講話嗎？我有許多需要了解他的地方，不知道他肯吿訴我嗎」？我這樣問着陳主任。</p>
<p>他帶着幽默的風趣答道「該你倒霉，你遇到的這位訪問對象，永遠不會使你達到目的，你要想了解他，除了請你在這兒當半年座上客而外，沒有第二個辦法。因爲他雖然在戰馬奔騰的沙塲上像一隻生龍活虎，而當他在平時生活中，却像一位幽閑斯文的秀才，他怕見生人，尤其他怕見新聞記者，各位之來，在他內心裏是非常高興的，可是他不知道怎樣招待你們這些佳賓，更不知道和你們說些什麽好，因此他今天下午見你們的時侯，始終沒有多說一句話。我想着即令明天你單獨去訪問他，也不會有好結男的」。「這却是我意外的趣事，孫將軍撕殺半生，爲什麼反怕見我們這些只有一只禿筆的新聞記者呢？照閣下所說，我將不能了解這位將軍了，但你是新聞界的老朋友，可否將你所認士的孫將軍介紹給我」？我也笑着問他。</p>
<p>「我知道的太少了，因爲我到這兒還不到半年呢，我只知道他沒有太太，而且獨身已經三十多年了，聽說從前曾有一位要人要他續絃，結果使他鬧了一塲「封金掛印」的故事，後來就沒有人再勸他了，他天性冲淡和易，沒有嗜好，好讀書，更好鼓勵人家讀書，對上級能絕對服從，對下級恩重於威。」</p>
<h3>蕪湖米市動態</h3>
<p>— 廿日航訊　本報特派員康風</p>
<p>蕪湖米市自秋收以來，輸出不甚旺盛，原因多端，而蕪湖米市米價有時高於江蘇無錫，江西九江以及湖北漢口，湖南長沙，固爲其一，而蕪地對採米地區的交通距離亦爲重要因素，譬如一向在蕪湖採米的廣潮帮即以粵漢鐵路復軌而向湖南採購一部米糧；因此，蕪湖米市秋收以後相當渡乏的在期待着一个大胃品來吸收。</p>
<p>中國農民銀行蕪湖分行奉命在安徽採購一部米糧以作軍糧公糧其試辦二十一天只交原訂期貨十分之一的米以后，只好試行到蕪湖米市以外的其他較小米市去採購。所以在不久以前，有米市將由蕪湖移至對江裕溪口的消息傳出。</p>
<p>蕪湖米業負責人王竹浦等當然不能坐視蕪湖米市商人連供應農行收購米糧都爲艱的不能勝任，所以邀集了陳卓夫議長等會同商定如不動產及可靠的保證人向農行作保證，按照不低於市價也不高於市價的價格爲農行這一次收購糧食担任供應。</p>
<p>執行這一次採購的農行，當然比較民卅四年安徽省政府採購軍糧要令安徽人民滿意，因爲這次買米是按市價付現，而民卅四年冬安徽省政府代糧食部收購的皖省糧食，普遍的按糧食的所定低價收購，付款時間又在繳出米稻二三個月以後，以致攤賣糧食的城鄕人民等於給政府取去一筆爲數不小的捐稅。</p>
<p>正在商業蕭條約臘月苦難中的蕪市，倘因對農行採購米糧能以做得硬挺而具信用，有可能有一筆百億元以上資金流入鄉農與城商以及碼頭工人口袋中，這可以練得蕪湖這個寄生性的商業城市顯得活躍而渡過年關。但蕪湖以及安徽整個經濟復蘇以及興旺還是有待一部更合理的國家經濟政策來刺激，推動！</p>

<h3>觀程硯秋演春閨夢</h3>
<p>— 馬慧心</p>
<p>程硯秋的「春閨夢」，是寓意於「可憐無定河邊骨，俱是春閩夢裏人。」而成；與程氏之「荒山淚」可謂姊妹作，同爲祈求和平，反戰的戲劇。</p>
<p>故事是後漢時內戰，州牧等徵兵於民，民生困疲；時平原有王恢等被徵投軍。王恢與妻張氏感情彌驚，新婚未半月，即賦離別。後張氏略聞王郞之噩耗，驚疑相思，積郁成夢，夢中驚遇王郞，不禁怨喜交加；醒來知夢，曷勝悲慟萬分。</p>
<p>此次演出之搭配小生，爲儲金鵬君。儲君之扮像可以「雍容華貴」四字表之。他與程氏搭配得很緊凑，活像一對新婚的小夫妻；更加上美觀的身段，留給觀衆一個美的印象。</p>
<p>「春閨夢」是一齣悲劇吧？所以在劇中放上二個小丑——醜丫頭與李信這一對，敎他們穿插些笑料，給觀衆心頭一鬆，不致讓悲苦的情緒緊張地，沉悶地壓在心口，這原是好的；可是，在第三塲長亭送征的時侯，不讓他們單上，偏敎他們夾在一起上。這樣一來，因爲有了他們的笑話，反把戲劇悲哀情緒的高潮給冲淡了。豈不可惜？本來這一塲的情節，是「長亭送征，生離死別」有哀感悱惻的唱詞，表情，加上「哭頭」等悲慘的情景，很能抓住觀衆的情緒的。前面旣有給觀衆感動的情節，後面再讓這一對小丑演出些笑話，一樣可使觀衆拭淚後，再破顏笑一笑的。</p>
<p>末塲，春閨驚夢，唱做俱皆吃重。程氏內心的表情，水袖上的工夫，都好極了。尤以唱至一去時陌上花似錦，今日樓頭柳又靑；可憐奴在深閨等，海棠開日我想到今……畢竟男兒多薄倖，誤人二字是功名；甜言蜜語眞好聽，誰知都是　恩情！」時，似嗔似愛地，將水袖向夢中駕遇到的夫婿面前一拂，眞是傳神極了，也美觀極了！眞可謂：一段閨怨，拂然袖上。</p>
<p>入夢時，配上輕幽的音樂，是平劇界在演出技巧上的改良的表現。可惜的是燈光，不是漸漸地暗下去，以表示悠悠人夢；而是突然的暗下去，這非但是與劇情欠調和，對於觀衆的視覺，也有不愉快的感覺。</p>
<p>平劇界，說改良平劇的話，已有好久了，要是大名伶能於平常逐漸注意改善的話，那末，平劇非但不易淘汰，而且會有比從前更發揚光大的一天。</p>
<p>「春閑夢」與「荒山淚」同樣的是程氏的成功傑作，此一代藝伶之藝術造詣，已臻登峰造極之境。</p>
<h3>談「神槍手」</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>「神槍手」是寫第一次歐戰時的著名阿岡戰役英雄約克伍長的一生事蹟，劇本是根據的克伍長的日記寫的，好在這位英雄至今健在，華納公司取得了這個影片的攝製權，這部偉大的作品才問世。</p>
<p>整個影片的上半部敍述的克的農村田園生活，後傘部記他的從軍歷史及經過，前後用的克對於宗敎思想的轉變來作一個劃分的界限及轉變的樞紐。</p>
<p>劇本對白雖然富有濃厚的宗敎氣崽，司是情節和表演的動人遮蓋了一切：年靑的的克是一個酗酒好玩的人，他不相信神與宗教，牧師和禮拜堂對他不發生興趣，唯一有好感的是縱酒騎馬射擊，這在老牧師的眼光中看來，他簡直是魔鬼附了身，於是，以慈悲博愛拯救世人的宗敎觀念來感化他，使他能够得到一個有力量的信仰，可是，一切努力都歸於失敗，老牧師的希望也成了泡影。整日射臘的的克邂逅了一少女，約克一生行程中的眞正轉變該就是從這時候開始，歷史上又有幾個人能够逃此向例呢？的克自然沒有例外，他開始懂得了修飾，甚麼力量都不能使他有所改進的人，居然因爲戀愛的關係，願意整日埋頭在田地中苦幹着，的克是覺悟了，他感覺到了袖的偉大，神的力量播弄着他，他發覺了以前的錯誤。</p>
<p>才皈依了基督，在上帝的愛的保護下，他做了一個最誠懇的信徒。聖經替代了以前一切的嗜好，他發現了書中的眞義，他反對戰爭，因爲聖經這樣地曉示他；不過，國家的法律不能輕易地變更，的克終於被召入伍，神技的槍擊使他得到了上峯的靑睞，升爲伍長，爲了他反對戰爭，長官特許假期十天，讓他去考慮抉擇。在夕陽下的山顚上，的克帶着兩本書：聖經和「美國歷史」一本爲自由主義而奮起的記載，的克開始了迷惑，倒底服從上帝反對一切殺人的戰爭呢？還是爲了保衛祖國，爲了自由平等而奮起一戰呢？看一看祖國錦繡的山河，偉大的的克選擇了後面的一條，戰爭雖然是荼害人民的，但是爲了消滅慘酷的戰爭還是需要用戰爭去解決它，這與敎義並無衝突，於是，的克神聖地參戰了。</p>
<p>看完了「神槍手」，我總有這樣一個感覺：「神槍手」與「一曲難心」太相似了，偉大的的克與天才的慧邦　有他們的　搜；但是都爲了女子而感到煩惱；約克覺悟了戰爭的眞義而從戎，蕭邦懊悔了一切而奏琴獻國，事雖異而意却同，抉擇不定的態度也正復相似。老牧師的誘導約克信敎，與「一曲難忘」裏的老敎授的處境也很相像；「神槍手」裏的一　土是不忘山下田地，「一曲難忘」的一撮土是毋忘祖國波蘭，一切的一切都有些差不多</p>
<p>同樣的，兩張片子的導演都怕專門注意故事的發展，會使情緒陷入於厭悶，因此，隨時穿插了些風趣的鏡頭。這張片子動人的塲面也很多：約克的母親用一盆冷水澆在他頭上；的克努力工作以備積錢買田，用筆在月曆上紀錄成績；限期將屆，猶未能達到目的，的克絕望，狂呌怨憤，山谷回聲；靜坐山頭，夕陽返照，約克努力思索行動時，全片的有意義鏡頭差不多都在描寫約克</p>
<p>導演的手法很簡潔聰明，的克和情敵的打架用對白叙出，再用情敵蹣跚走出的塲面來襯托，也極得法；只有約克在戰勝後歸國的一段似太冗長外，別的都很使觀衆滿意。</p>
<p>演員中，飾約克的賈萊可柏簡直無慌可擊，與老牧師對話時的不在意與油滑的神氣，妙到秋毫，其他如誠懇的熊度，幽默的舉動，勇敢的戰鬥都表演得非常的盡力。老牧師也很不錯。</p>
<p>還有特別値得一提的是音樂的伴奏，與情節非常拍合，輕鬆，緊張，喜，怒，哀，樂，完全吸引了觀衆的情緒。</p>
<p>這是一部動人至深的影片，我以爲。</p>
<h3>送新中國劇社去台灣</h3>
<p>— 眼</p>
<p>新中國劇社同人和其他的幾個劇隊在西南掙扎了好幾年，有過不少的努力和成就，勝利以後却遭翻車慘禍，輾轉流徙，不得安定，這在人民代表拚命摧毀人民慘淡經營的藝術園地的今天的中國，原是不足爲奇的。</p>
<p>幸而聲有台灣可去，幸而台灣有他們去，這倒是一椿可喜的事。</p>
<p>台灣自從前淸光緒二十一年三月二十三日全島割給日本，經過敵寇壓榨的悠長歲月，好容易終盼望到歸還訊國，可是台灣人民今天的生活怎樣，他們對於祖國的觀念怎樣，對於祖國的人印象怎樣，他們不感覺到失望而幻滅麼。</p>
<p>你們這一去，固然在把祖國的新興戲劇藝術給台彎同胞介紹，而更重要的是給台灣同胞看看另一部分祖國的人，好重新把他們的勇氣鼓勵起來。</p>
<p>你們去演出「鄭成功」這幾部戲，正是非常合適，這可以吿訴台灣同胞，吿訴中國人，從前的英雄是如何困苦艱難孤軍奮鬥以保全中國的一角領土，而現在的「英雄」是：現在的所謂英雄和從前的英雄相去何祇十萬八千里，而我們又不能等着那種英維出世，我們祇有自己苦幹，祇有自己管自己的事，除去民主的一切障礙，藝衛纔有前途，國家纔有前途。但願大家努力。</p>
<h3>「衣錦榮歸」中林道鈞的小家庭。父親顧而也，母親談瑛，女兒于復瑛。</h3>
<h3>戲劇界的門戶之見</h3>
<p>— 張家浩</p>
<p>戲劇走上今日的低滯，我們不能否認，「門戶之見」的存在，也多多少少是其中的因素之一，這極其不好的現像，早該連根拔掉它；可是大家並不自覺地讓它在根深蒂固地生長。</p>
<p>遠在五年前我踏進戲劇圈子時，我逐漸知道了圈子裹的傳統壞習氣，由於工作的作風不同，有「學院派」「海派」的區分，由於工作的立塲不同，工作的目的不問……一個編劇者，一個導演，一個演員；……也可以率領一夥人，形成類似班底組織的小圈子，小系統；因此歷年來在重慶劇壇所見到的戲劇工作者十分力量中，三分却要花費應付「門」之見」引起的人事上，不能全力以赴，這實在是一件最痛心的事！道種怪現狀產生了最大的惡果；「門戶之見」旣不易消除，而你沒有系統也休想站得住；所以道些小圈子，小組織，一直在爲着榮耀「門戶」的前題下，玩着搶劇塲；搶劇本等等的把戲；要達目約有時更不惜傾軋互訐……弄得整個劇壇鳥烟障氣；勝利後，劇運中心轉移上海更多了一條，「上海」與「重慶」的鴻溝；你能說這不是事實麼？我不想再掘發下去了；我願望在話劇低潮的今日；每個愛好戲劇藝術的工作者；趕快拿出藝術良心來消除「門戶之見」；挽救戲劇的厄運！只有「精誠團結」才能抵擋外來的種重壓力——只有「赤誠相見」能自力更生！</p>

<p>電影製片商富萊克林曾負責攝製「天長地久」，「大地」，「萬世師表」。「魂斷籃橋」等著名影片，據稱，此後數年內美國將有較佳之影片問世。電影業於第一次世界大戰後數年，始有「璇宮艷史」及「西綫無戰事」等名片，則此次大戰後之傑作，自尙須有待云。</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>幻想曲</p>
<p>貝多芬，許勃，巴赫，却依考夫斯基等的夢的領域，在這裏無限制地昇華了。我們眨責過「幻遊南海」和「小飛象」，更有人非議「騎士降龍記」，只有第一張長篇卡通「白雪公主」至今享受盛譽，於是華爾狄斯耐的能力漸被忽視，如今看了「幻想曲」，我們才堅決相信華爾狄斯耐藝術的才華，「幻想曲」是他才力表現的最高峯，固然可說空前，也許亦是絕後了，因此那些後期作品如「幻遊南海」和「小飛象」等無不相顧失色。</p>
<p>我認爲「一曲難忘」失敗的一點是蕭邦樂曲的缺乏演釋，這一層素來非常困難，音樂家超空閒的漫想和音波節律上的情緒性，自非攝影機所能表現，它們都是飄渺無可捉摸的，欲將這些具體化，總是令人失望，就像小牧正英也無法表達杜比西在「牧神的午後」裏的象徵主美一般。「一曲難一忘」的另一缺點是不够偉大，氣魄距離音樂領域之廣太遠。這兩點，我們感謝華爾狄斯耐的靈感，「幻想曲」對於樂曲的釋義和擴張情緒兩點，表現細緻無遺，我想即使貝多芬許勃自己來看，必將感到驚奇，華爾狄斯跗對於他們樂曲幻想成份的發掘，頗多創造，不但表現了許多非筆墨可以形容的美麗，而且描繪了想僚以外的超現實。「幻想曲」足稱二十世紀不朽的光榮。</p>
<p>「幻想曲」是六支樂曲組成的組曲，在表現上俱覺淋漓痛快，如以個人愛好來說，我歡喜貝多芬的「田園交響樂」，却依考夫斯基的「胡桃夾」，「白爾山頂的夜」和「祭春樂」。露永神，香菌舞，羣花舞，小仙童和鬼魂亂飛，是爲美中之美。第一支掃劃巴赫對天體的在想，完全抽象，用光波節律性地表現音波，神奇無比。史篤柯斯基是當今一大指揮，他的手確可呼風喚雨。</p>
<p>與我同行</p>
<p>看「幻想曲」是一種幸福，看「與我同行」是一種歡慰。「與我同行」是人世相的一頁水墨畫。水墨畫沒有彩色繽紛，自有其淸麗，平靜的特點，淡淡數筆，一切哲學都說盡了。</p>
<p>編劇人有「人之初性本善」的觀念，道哀的角色沒有一個壞人，但是也沒有一個純粹的完人，整個戲的骨髓是老牧師口中的一句話：他時常想着別人，換句話說，那個時常顧全別人的人，隨時自我犧牲，並不自私，人類僩個如此，何愁世道險惡。他吃了虧去成全別人，到後一無所獲，悄悄地踏攝雪地走了，與我同行，看他孤零的影子，你疑心無人隨行，但是他的愛情和人家對他的愛情，伴了上帝，正是與他同行。這個靑年神父的角色寫得好極了，不軟不火，恰到好處，他的性格的刻劃是一步又一步，一層又一層，他告訴我們神父亦是凡人，他會彈爵士樂，他一樣好吵鬧，一樣有一個浪漫的過往，雖然立地成佛，本性依然留存，他對世道的改良，不用武力和演說，輕輕的感情的一揮手，他便安排快樂的種子。以前我們曾經厭棄宗敎片，它的枯燥，沉悶，高調令人入睡，因此我放過「聖瑪利亞的鐘聲」，但在這裏，我郤以熱誠推薦輕　之中意味深長的「與我同行」，這張一九四四年的金像獎巨片。</p>
<p>導演李奧麥卡萊手法流暢，佈局緊湊，尤其使沒有情節的故事生動，溫暖，非同小可。平克勞斯貝的演技眞率可愛，低音一曲，令人心折。演老牧師的巴霄費茲格納和其他幾位配角成續供佳，難怪得獎</p>
<p>歐美人有時想像有一種「奇怪的女人」，正如好冒險的男子一樣，把生命靑春幸福和美麗帶去冒險，英國人的想法浪漫得驚人，難以置信，爵士夫人竟會做刦盜，劇情是一個巧得不能再巧的Melociama，故意安排的痕　太多，絕無眞實性和人悄味。導演有幾個鏡頭處理不差。　姆斯梅遜沒有發揮，瑪格麗洛美扮相學海蒂拉瑪，我最欣賞的還是演卡蓮娜的潘屈麗茜亞露，嬌　秀麗。男演員太英國風。無一入眼。</p>

<h3>馬棚之夜</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>下了一天的雪，現在已經停止，風也歇下去了。月亮從雲吐裏鑽出來，照着平曠的大地，像按上一件銀狐皮的大敞。</p>
<p>一排棗樹的頂上，堆上了白髪，在朦朧的月色下打瞌睡。樹上的鳥兒，大概是爲了敵不住寒氣的侵襲吧，從夢中驚醒轉來，發出咕咕咕的呌聲。</p>
<p>靠近棗樹旁，有一個馬棚，支柱和中樑是用瘦小的楊木架起，棚頂和牆壁是用高粱桿編成，厚雪壓着棚頂，整個馬棚，彷彿年老人不勝重負似的，作傾斜的形狀。</p>
<p>棚裏的一義油燈在吐着一朶黃色的火光，從高梁桿的隙縫裏射出來，照得棚簷下的許多冰柱，在發着微弱的光亮。</p>
<p>馬棚裏拴着兩匹高大的馬，一匹是全白色，一匹是棕色，額頭上有一塊白毛，牠們在一個木　裏嚼着草料，不時因分食不均，牠們在呌囂着，同時各把後蹄舉起，向對方踢着，馬蹄鐵在閃着亮。</p>
<p>在馬棚的另一個角落的地上，鋪着一點草，草上坐着一個四十來歲的中年漢子，穿着一身破壞的灰色軍服，蓋了一條破被絮。他臉上密佈皺紋，皺紋裏嵌滿了灰沙，正中聳起一個大鼻子，一雙大眼睛，長着粗長的睫毛，眼皮彷彿在和睡魔鬥爭似的，一時閉下一時又睜開，當閉下的時候，就會聽到團長嚴厲的命令：</p>
<p>「趙大，我今天升你做我的馬伕，你要好好的餵牠，只許她們胖，不許瘦！你知道嗎？……」</p>
<p>他一驚，醒了轉來，看見這兩匹馬兒，還是在嚼着草。</p>
<p>他猜想在這深更半夜，團長一定已經熟睡了，我可以趁這個機會也睡了一下，這樣一想，兩雙眼睛早己閉起，頭兒慢慢磕下，碰在旁邊豎着的鐵鏟的柄上。</p>
<p>哦，這是一柄鐵鏟，是前任馬伕移交給他的，有着這柄鐵鏟，可以鏟馬議，把馬糞積聚起來，可以，可以……</p>
<p>他想到這裏，鈎起了許許多多的心事，睡魔也一時無從侵襲了。</p>
<p>趙大本來是在團部裏當一名伙夫，他不會燒菜，只會劈柴燒火，許多人都議笑他的無能，他也只好忍受。</p>
<p>他家裏有一個老母，有一個女人，還有兩個孩子。女人每天給長官洗幾件衣裳，她的收入，只能養她一個子，餘外一老二小，就要靠他來撫義，可是一個伙夫的收入，怎麼能够呢？</p>
<p>適巧這僩時侯，團長要換馬伕，他就託人說話，纔得到這個「差使」，今夜就是他就任馬伕以來，正式「視事」的一夜。雖然馬伕與伙伕的餉金是差不多，但在他看起來，似乎馬伕要比伙伕略高一籌，同時馬糞是値錢的，這馬糞一天天的積起來，不是要比自己的餉金大上好幾倍嗎？「什麼？不要做？」</p>
<p>想到這裏，只見那白馬兒　高了尾巴，他趕快站起。兩條腿兒，因爲盤坐得過久，有一點發麻，身子幌了一下，他忙抓起鏟子，走到白馬的後面，在等着一顆顆的黃色的「球」，落下地來，接着就鏟到一個木筐裏去。</p>
<p>馬糞在騰起熱汽，一股難聞的臭氣，衝進他的鼻管：</p>
<p>「把馬糞去餵養自己的老母孩子……」這樣一想，不田地心裏一陣難過，擲下鏟子，仍舊坐在草堆上。</p>
<p>聽見有人踏着雪在走過來，發出擦擦……的響聲。</p>
<p>誰？莫非團長來察看嗎？坐着，一動都不動。雖然有蟲子在咬他，他也不動。</p>
<p>門推開了，一個逢着頭髮，身子裏在破絮裏的中年女人，映進他的眼簾。</p>
<p>「你半夜三更，出來幹嗎？」他認出是自己的女人時，發出嚴厲的詢問。</p>
<p>「……這個……吞吞吐吐地，有話說不出來，只把身子再挨進一步，順手把門閉起。她的瘦臉兒，被凍得通紅，限睛也有一點腫。</p>
<p>「什麼？你說什麼？」</p>
<p>「這個差使，還是不要做……」</p>
<p>「這個差使，你得天天熬夜，白天還要帶着馬兒去溜，你的身體，身體，怎麼能够吃得消呢？」她說着，一雙眼裏含着淚光　趙大低下頭，看着他女人鞋上堆着的白雪。接着，仍舊抬起臉來；</p>
<p>「你快回去！你不要管我！」</p>
<p>「我……一兩行熱淚終於下了。</p>
<p>「快回去！」他站起，一手拉開高梁桿編織成的門兒，一手把自己的女人推出去。女人的身子幾乎給他推倒了。等到她出了門，他很快地把門閉起。</p>
<p>他呆呆地站着，又聽着他女人走在雪堆上，發出「擦，擦，擦」的聲音，慢慢地由近而遠。</p>
<p>「你要好好的餵養牠們，只許牠們胖，不許瘦……」團長的命令，彷彿又在耳邊響着。</p>
<p>「嘟……」棕色馬，吃飽了以後，在發出一聲快樂的長呌，接着白馬也應和一聲。兩個馬頭在柱子上擦着，把整個馬棚都搖幌起來了。</p>
<h3>诗语</h3>
<p>— 歐陽琴</p>
<p>一切莫把一句句的散文分列成爲詩；眞眞的詩，是情感的沙，心灵的籠，經藝術的手腕而淘出來的金</p>
<p>做詩好似登山，一步比一步艱難，走到半山，回頭烟霧迷漫，走到盡頭，忽見峯迥路轉，烟消讓散</p>
<h3>明風怒影（攝影）</h3>
<p>— 易安</p>
<h3>水之思</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>在西南山地裹住久以後，回到江南底多水之鄕，就好比從一個貧乏的軍隊生活回到了美女如雲的花園裏來，這裏是生機蓬勃的，一切顧得聲富，顧得亮麗。</p>
<p>水是美的，水是一種流動的思想，有着窈窕的身段，和巧笑的聲音。</p>
<p>水是美的，水是一種閃光的生命，有着多彩的顏色，和無涯際的遠景。</p>
<p>一位詩人說：你看，水天的邊沿上，一條如許長的，古美人底腰帶……</p>
<p>水給我們許多如花如玉的夢想，沒有水的地方恐怕同監獄沒有什麼區別。歷史上的詩人和思想者沒有一個不愛水的，水給他們以自由的感興。雪萊是死在水裹的，屈原是死在水裹的，李白是死在水裹的，連希臘神話裏的水仙少年也從水的倒映裏溶化了他底美麗的生命。</p>
<p>透澈的水，淸潔的水，光明的水，我們從他底包羅萬象的流動裏面，看見了雲彩。朝陽。晚霞。花樹和許多許多的風景。</p>
<p>蘇格拉底說過：至於我們呢？從雲抽出了思想，語言和哲學來；而水則給了我們許多繁華的，萬紫千紅的幻想。我常常散步在河岸上，坐在河邊的崖石上，靜靜的思想；有時候孤另另的整天坐在那裏，好像在一個微妙的音樂會上，一個優美的歌劇塲中，低低的想着許多愛情，許多夢境，流水唱着歌，從他底生動的流，多情的流；我好像聽見了自己生命的躍動，和靑春的血液的奔湧。有時候我把粗糙的手放在他底溫柔的流動裏面，水從我底指縫閒微笑流過，有一些微癢，一等怡然的恬爽，好像一個女孩被人抓住了接處，這時候才明確的感知了小小的生命的喜悅。</p>
<p>水是美的，宛如一個永恒的音樂，我底全生涯充滿了這種音樂，很幼小的時候我便愛好水，背着母親偷偷的在淺水由間擁抱着水，親吻着水，在夏天整日浸在水裏，整”同水在一起，忘記了晚餐，忘記了母親底可囑；甚至偷偷的想着，有一天讓我和水一起去流浪，不論到那個地方和那個季候，想着那遠方的一個城市和島嶼，說不定正有一個愉快的節塲和小的舞會。</p>
<p>我常常和那些漁船上的人在一起，他們底生活使我感到神秘，他們底漂泊，他們底歌聲都使我沉醉；從幼小的心胸，早已醞釀着一個冒險的流浪。他們給我談說水的故事，我喜歡聽那老漁夫的辛酸的經歷，喜歡看那站在夕陽裏的船娘底健美的身姿和水一般溫柔的笑靨。</p>
<p>但我怕看見海，海是難以捉摸的，喜怒無常的，尤其是當我後來讀了一個布達勒湼底漁夫底悲劇以後。</p>
<p>使我永遠難以忘却的是那江南底小的夜，住在冬日的鄉邨裏，夜半從惡夢中驚醒，於是可以聽見小河底靜靜的流水的聲音，和河岸上承車的哀怨的轉動。那種聲音使我感知了底悲哀，好比感知了生命底悲哀；一直到現在，我才解悟了道種悲哀的流動是和生底凄凉的行進完全一致的。也是到現在才明瞭，爲什麼那些倦於生存的智者要把水來做他們永恒的眠床，甚至像孩子般的睡在搖籃裏，在母親般底流水聲裏，在廣大的星空之下。</p>
<p>水是美的，但也含有一種深沉的悲哀，好比那聖女底含淚的微笑，在我們罪惡的世界上閃耀，我們到處可以看見那許多動人的，靜默的淚光，許多哲人是因爲有了這種閃光才甘心在世間受苦的。</p>
<h3>風片</h3>
<p>— 楊廉沅</p>
<p>一下午，我在冷風中尋覓花香。</p>
<p>花圃的甬道還跟去年一樣，泥路上躑躅着一雙雙美麗的足，就說是一個個的倩影吧，因冬陽而投射在甬道上緩緩移動，遂使我悵惘久之了。</p>
<p>年靑人，是想到些什麼了呢？花圃裹向榮的花由黃的變成紅的，而今却又蔓生黃白相間的花了；花開花謝，又怎會敎我想到什麼？久久凝思，我何爲甘於寂寞？爲細碎的感情而苦了自己？</p>
<p>在冷風裏，花見也失去她的矜持，任風兒摧殘，花瓣飛舞在我的足邊，花香也許非我所有的了。</p>
<p>凱羅·紀伯倫說得好，「別離的日子，能成爲會集的日子麼」？這永遠是一個問號，而今想來，倒要看我們在別離的日子裹是怎樣地堅持各自的忠貞了。</p>
<p>尋覓那一霎間的花香，只爲她的艷麗，却也是我何爲甘於寂寞底最好分辯了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血136</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「二十一時二十六分……參謀本部秘書室轉閣台近衛首相緊急電話，着『滿州國』行『長勝』號，停進，即返原起飛機塲，待令行動。……又令：該機着陸後，着現任大陸派遺軍行營，參謀總部電訊課，兼電訊設計主任，鶴見玉中校，待令行動。此令。秘術室値日官，急。」</p>
<p>大家傳着了這個電訊，各人又在傳話板上發表意見了：</p>
<p>「開玩笑哪，軍情如『火』。現在像『冰』了」。</p>
<p>「其中怕有很大的事件咧，不然，爲了這樣個人小事、怎麼可以撤同行軍命令</p>
<p>「啞謎啞謎！我們這幾個人，就算到了大陸，必定陣亡，這兆頭象徵着『出行不利」哩！</p>
<p>「長勝」號九點五十五分，在機塲着陸，早有軍部一名當値傅令「長勝」號機長，可向該管部門長官，請示重飛時間，又令鶴見　隨當値速向參謀本　秘書室報到。</p>
<p>鶴見到了秘書室，値日官在鶴見報吿，官職，事山，之後，立刻將備就的一封文件，交給鶴見，呌他坐了原車，趕到別府去說是首相巳經有兩决電話來催問了。</p>
<p>鶴見接到這到公文，無話可說，面上極力保持鎮靜，手上可是可是也揑着一把汗，却是爲何？因爲他要二度去晋謁近衛了。第一度鶴見是被動，心下僅僅有些惶惑。這第二度，近衛調過頭來做了被動，局面完全不同；這就要單看自己戲劇化的表演本領了。但有一點，却是明明擺在那裏的事實，近衛是莫明其妙的被人裝在胡　裏了。</p>
<p>這話怎麼說？第一，常晚第二次晚報號外的那封短簡，也許有他手下的情報專員給他報吿過了。這在他，至少認爲一種宵小的胡關，或是敵派政客，在跟他開玩笑，但他却可預料到，沒有道大胆量的人，敢跑到他這秘密機關專來尋鬥。事實上簡直不可能。就會有這麼幾個瘋人，鑽了進來，那也只需幾名衛隊，或便衣偵探，費兩秒鐘的工夫，就可逮捕起來，關到死因牢裏去；連審問都是多餘的。</p>
<p>再說得實際點，也許這簡短的事，他根本沒有知道；因爲從他的地位上說，他掌握着軍國大計，手下該有多少特務門部職員，難道遠少了人，担任着應付這們芝麻大的一點小事之類的工作？連這樣簡直近乎見戲的事，也要向他報吿請示，那麼，他們這些手下的侍衛，便衣，別動，等等，豈非都是專門吃飯不管事的？）</p>
<p>假定他本人旣然不會管到這樣小事，那麼，又是誰打電話去命令參謀本部秘書室，打急電把「長勝」號調回的呢？不用說，當然又是鶴見自己的人，鬧的玄虛了。</p>
<p>然而近衛並不是一個木頭人哩。他雖說不一定算是一個雄才大略的政客，軍人但是旣能掙到了這一人之下萬人之上的現在地位，也不容易，心下總算有些鬼門檻和巧疙瘩呢。鶴見固然可以使用手上種種便利，和手下一班人才，弄了這大一個玄虛。問題只在被捉弄這人，能否識得透。如識不透，那自然可以按照預定的計劃，一直鬧下去。但是萬一呌人識透了機關，豈不是一百個糟？並且糟得沒有止境哩。</p>
<p>狂風驟雨暴發之前，必有一度晦冥；大地震之前必有片刻的沉寂；大戰的前夜，必有一度可怕的肅靜；同樣，在鶴見搜索「七封秘緘」計劃發動之前，也有這麼一小段的靜默期。這小段的靜默期是在八點半到十點之間。實際的動作上，是從鶴見上飛機起，直到再度晋見近衛爲止。這是一個可怖的靜默期，因爲在道一段小時期內，鶴見與手下已經斷了聯絡。</p>

<h3>山雨欲來快補漏　過年贅語</h3>
<p>— 度新</p>
<p>急景凋年中，送舊迎新，不勝感慨，但即使是百事皆非，也不能沒有新的希望。道里且一談「收支無法平衡」怎麼辦？</p>
<p>財局秘書長在市政會議上報吿本市財政狀况，說是：「收支無法平衡！」</p>
<p>是的，今日整個中國的財政，已面臨絕大困難，而有「捉襟見肘」的感覺，「收支無法平衡」，尤為一般的事贊，初不獨上海一地為然。</p>
<p>至於講到在財政拮据的時候，要達到收支平衡的狀態，不是沒有方法，有是有的。那就是「開源」和「節流」。不過，財局秘書長之所以言「無法平衡」那句話，不是不懂得這二種方法的運用，相反的，是因為這二種方法，運用的次數太多了；一方面已失其時，而有「此路不通」的感覺。另方面，也就因為這辦法並不是一個最妥善的辦法。譬如說，『開黴新稅，以增稅收，』那就屬於「開源」的一類。奈何今日的老百姓，一聽見「稅」字，就會想起「阿司匹靈」。眞的「老」之為甚，其可「新」乎？假如你一意孤行，偏要「稅稅如意」，無疑的，那是違反「民意」，會引起民衆的反感的！至於，屬於「節流」一類的，就像「裁員」。不過，這方法的運用，也有一個「極限」，不是可以反覆運用的。「裁員」裁到了某一限度，就不能再「裁」，否則又會使行政效率銳减的！我們總不能說一個機關裹面，自「局長」以至「聽差」，都呌一個人統任的，是不是？</p>
<p>那麽今日中國的財政，就眞沒有一個兩全的辦法，可以使收支達到平衡的狀態麽？</p>
<p>不，決不，方法是有的，怕行的不澈底會壞事。我們曉得一所房屋漏了，一定要呌「泥水匠」來「築漏」，否則，那所房屋是會漏得更厲書的！「小洞不補，大洞吃苦」，這句話一些也不錯的。而目今的中國正是一所「千瘡百孔」的「破屋」，年久失修，再加「風」「雨」襲擊，假如再不設法「築漏」，只是「水來面盆受」，或是在屋內撑起雨傘，遮遮蓋蓋，就終非久善之計，恐怕遲早會「坍屋」的！</p>
<p>所以這第三個方法，應當是一個較好的方法，而且也是一個「行得通」的辦法。（只要有決心）。這個方法，我們就稱它做「築漏」。不是嗎？「外貨傾銷」「官吏貪」「走私漏稅」「內戰未已」……這些都是今日中國大「漏洞」的所在，也是財政拮据的最大癥結。假如那些政治舞毫上的「泥水匠」能把這些「漏洞」尋出來，逐一予以「修築」「彌補」，那麼中國的財政，是不難達到「平衡狀態」的！</p>
<p>「築漏」，似乎是介於「開源」和「節流」二者之間的一種方法；它又是兼具這二種方法的特質的。害怕的是知易行難！</p>
<h3>聰明極了</h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>一次亞瑟。哥南道爾（譯者按：即大名鼎鼎福爾摩斯偵探案之作者）乘一部街車回到他在巴黎的旅館去，當他付了那車夫車錢時，後者說：「謝謝妳，道爾先生。」</p>
<p>「你怎麽會知道我的名字的？」道作家問。</p>
<p>『我在報紙上看見你今天就要從法國的南部來此地了，」道車夫解釋道：「你整個的像貌指出你是一個英國人，你在過去一星期中剃了一次頭，而很顯明地你的頭髮式樣是一個法國南部的理髮師剃的。」</p>
<p>「驚異極了！」這位歇洛克爾爾摩斯的創造者贊美道：「你還有別的證據嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有了，」這車夫回答說：「除了那件事實就是你的行李上有你的名字。」</p>

<h3>倫敦女士們，排隊買絲襪。</h3>
<h3>我所知道的谷春帆</h3>
<p>— 克暢</p>
<p>勝利後上海第二任財政局長谷容帆氏是個博學多才的經濟學家。但谷氏並不一向在財政部中任事，而是郵政局中的郵員。</p>
<p>在十多年前，谷春帆氏祇是上海郵政管埋局中的一個甲等郵務員。他在大學裏讀的是經濟，平時又喜歡動動筆，年靑人往往不滿現實，常時一個姓王的上司有所不滿，但又不能把谷氏去職（因當時郵局的人事制度極佳，上司不能隨自己的高興而把屬下解履）。直到不久後，王氏奉命調遣屬下。谷氏首當其衝，被調到河南南陽縣，做當地一個小小郵局的局長。南陽地瘠民貧，生活當然困苦，但上司的命令，谷氏抗拒也無用，祇得鬱鬱而赴南陽上任。</p>
<p>在南陽任中，事務比較少，並且沒有地方可作公餘遊樂，遂埋頭於經濟的研究。下了三年苦功，寫成了一本關於中國經濟的書籍，又把它譯成英文。等這些工作做好，谷氏又調到總局工作，而這本關於中國經濟的書籍就在此時出版。</p>
<p>此書一出，大得學者們的賞識，上司也另眼相看，幾年之中，又壓次升遷。英文版在國外的銷路世很可觀，外人都認為這書的作者是們了不起的經濟學家。</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭前，財政部長孔祥熙氏出國借款，那時候美人對谷氏已有個印象，當孔氏一下飛機，就有人問：「有一位密司脫谷在不在？」孔氏根本未知谷氏是誰。幸得侍從人員回答道：「密斯脫谷沒有同來」。才算應付過去。孔氏在事後當然要調査誰是這個名震新大陸的密斯脫谷了。一打聽之下，知道他是寫過一本關於中國經濟書的作者。回國之後，知道谷氏在郵局服務，遂有意提拔，把谷氏升遷得很快。民國三十三年，谷氏曾隨同參與國際貨幣會議，因為他是貨幣專家。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，郵政局所表演的接收成績，曾得蔣主席讚許。上海是國際性的都市，長財務的尤需廉潔有能，於是把在郵局服務的谷氏偕到財部，命其出長上海市財政局長。</p>
<h3>送舊迎新話爆竹</h3>
<p>— 黃接靑</p>
<p>爆竹，一名鞭砲，又名爆仗，傳係三國時代魏馬鈞所發明，至隋唐時代，改製成熖火，為雜戲技要之一種，以火藥製砲作為戰具，則始於宋朝</p>
<p>製造爆竹的物料為：厚草紙，細錢，泥沙，黏土，導綫，着火錢和黑色火藥。黑色火藥是硝石炭，硫黃的混合物。</p>
<p>我國擅長製造爆竹，每年行銷海內外，尤以荷印及馬來亞一帶，運銷最大，以民國二十四年為例，我國（包括香港）輸入荷印的爆竹，達荷幣三十五萬六千一百七十八盾之多。</p>
<p>因為我國的爆竹製造商，墨守成法，不思改良，所以爆力最巨的高升砲，最高也不能超過百英尺。</p>
<p>爆竹發響和上升的原理是：當着導火綫燃燒後、傳至火藥，引起爆炸，發生多量氣體向後急速排出，由力的反作用推動爆竹向反方向射出，又因火藥爆炸將四面封堅的紙壁震裂，所以發出響聲。</p>
<p>人生</p>
<h3>騎驢歟騎馬馬歟</h3>
<p>— 摩尼</p>
<p>幾個朋友聚在一起撩天，有一次，竟扯上了人生問題。扯了大半天，結論呢？朋友們大都贊成我們的國粹，所調「合乎中庸」。　朋友甲說，他有一首打油詩，倒可以代表中國人的人生哲學，茲照抄如下：</p>
<p>「前人騎馬我騎驢，仔細思量我不如，回顧後面拉車漢，比前不足後有餘。」</p>
<p>假使要問比「後」有餘，又怎樣呢？當然是那位騎驢的朋友，心平氣和的得勝地騎着走了。</p>
<p>在中學時代，對什麽都興趣盎然，理想最高，進取心最大。當你在大學時代，是至于跨進社會的圈子。對這社會有了點認識，就有點心灰意懶的樣子，末後，再碰上幾枚釘子，澆上幾瓢冷水，於是乎對什麼都心灰意懶了，幸運的你中了「知足常樂」的毒，幾個譬喻一比，你又心滿意足了。</p>
<p>而問題的嚴重性，就在這裏。</p>
<p>假使你不前進，僅僅休息一下，再前進。倒也沒什麽關係。假若你回顧一下後面的拉車漢，甚至於挑腳伕吧：那就什麽都完啦，後面不是有更多的不如你嗎？</p>

<h3>是誤殺的嗎？</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>霍達耐敎授正在落機山打獵的時候，有人通知他，某一個露營，發生了慘劇。心中以為他自己，或許對於探案有所帮助，便走到那出事的地方去，自我介紹了之後，白德婁（那犧牲者的朋友），便把那件不幸的事吿訴他。</p>
<p>『馬歇爾在昨天晚上九點鐘還沒有回來的時候，我覺得有些担心事了，因為他對這裏的山路是一些也不熟悉的。天上旣沒有一顆星，又沒有月亮，並且很黑晴，所以，我決心去尋他。因為我們露宿的營盤，駐紮得比任何人欲遠五哩路呢，這是你所匯該知道的。</p>
<p>『在營火上再加了一些木頭，然後，我就出去了。找尋了約有一個多鐘頭，我走到山峽的斜坡時，看見一對眼睛在黑暗中，向我發着光地瞪着我。</p>
<p>「我呼喊了兩聲，但是沒有回音是我以為那是山上的獅子，便開槍了。你可以想像得出，當我走近了那裏，點燃了一支火柴，我是如何的懼怕啊，我巳經把馬歇爾的頭打碎了。那是多麼可怕的遭遇呀！</p>
<p>『我就把他的屍體帶回營中，然後，走到就近的房子中去報吿這件意外的不幸事件。』</p>
<p>『當你發現馬歇爾的時候，離開你露宿的營有多少遠？』霍達耐敎授問。</p>
<p>『約有四分之一英哩遠？』</p>
<p>『現在我看見你的右手是用綳帶包紮着。你是用那一隻手開槍的呀？』</p>
<p>『啊！我是兩隻手都會開槍的啊！』</p>
<p>『可不可以讓我看一看你的槍？』</p>
<p>『好的。」白德婁說，順便把槍遞了過來。</p>
<p>『唔！歐洲製造的，這槍你是早巳就有的嗎？有了多少時候？』</p>
<p>『不，那可以說是新的呢。』霍達耐敎授突然嚴厲地說：『為什麼你故意的謀殺馬歇爾？你不用狡辯，他的確是你故意所謀殺的。』</p>
<p>聰明的讀者，敎授怎麼知道白德婁是故意謀殺了他的同伴的？</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National General Budget Proposal for the 36th year was originally scheduled to be submitted for discussion at the Supreme National Defense Council on the 28th. However, because the proposal needed to be discussed and decided by the Audit Committee first, before it could be submitted for deliberation, it was rescheduled to be submitted at the next regular meeting of the National Defense Council.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Resident Committee of the Senate is scheduled to meet at 9 AM on the 30th to review the national general budget. It is said that this meeting will take several days to complete.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Executive Yuan's regular meeting, originally scheduled for the 28th, was temporarily cancelled due to a conflict with the meeting time of the Supreme National Defense Council.</p>
<h3>Methods for Compiling and Reviewing Budgets for Provinces and Municipalities Under the Direct Jurisdiction Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Supreme National Defense Council passed the following methods for compiling and reviewing budgets for provinces and municipalities under the direct jurisdiction for the 36th year on the 28th: (1) Each provincial and municipal (municipalities under the direct jurisdiction are referred to collectively as provinces and cities hereinafter) government should, in accordance with the approved administrative guidelines and budget preparation guidelines, quickly prepare an annual general budget of revenue and expenditure and send it to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (three copies), the Executive Yuan (ten copies), and the Ministry of Finance (one copy). At the same time, it should be sent to the provincial and municipal councils for review, and any opinions should also be sent to the Executive Yuan. (3) After receiving the general budget proposal mentioned above, the Executive Yuan should immediately convene the relevant departments to review it and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval. Then, it should be sent by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to the central government for approval. The budget should be approved by the highest budget authority. After the provincial and municipal budgets are approved, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should consolidate them and forward them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and simultaneously notify the Executive Yuan. (4) After the Legislative Yuan decides on the general budget mentioned above, it should be submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, and at the same time, it should be sent to the Executive Yuan for distribution to the provincial and municipal governments for execution. (5) After the general budgets of the provinces and cities are approved by the central highest budget authority, they may be executed first by order to meet actual needs.

<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Holds Regular Meeting; Approves New Standards for Adjusting Civil Servant Salaries; Decides on Transitional Measures for Unifying the Northeast Monetary System</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The 212th regular meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council was held at 9 AM on the 28th, chaired by Ju Zheng, with more than 30 attendees, including Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi. The following important cases were passed: (1) The proposal for the standard for the payment of living subsidies for central civil servants and teachers was approved (according to the approved standard sent by the Executive Yuan, such as the amounts reported on the 28th). It will be implemented from December, and the adjusted and increased funds will be disbursed by the Ministry of Finance first, and the additional funds will be handled at the end of the year. (2) The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' request to formulate the "Methods for Compiling and Reviewing Budgets for Provinces and Cities for the 36th Year" was approved. (3) The proposal that principals of public schools at all levels may concurrently serve as representatives of public opinion organs was approved. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, Article 2 of the Provincial and County Councilors Election Regulations and Article 3 of the Municipal Councilors Election Regulations state that principals of public schools at all levels only have the right to be elected as representatives of public opinion. After being elected, they must choose one position to resign from and cannot hold both positions concurrently. The Ministry of Interior believes that this is not entirely consistent with the original legislative intent and the resolution is as follows: through legislative procedures, the following sentence is added after the second paragraph of the original Article 2 and Article 3, "The restrictions in the preceding Article 1 do not apply to principals of schools at all levels: 'and may concurrently serve after being elected.'" (4) The proposal by Committee Member Zhu Qiqing to have the two specialized committees on finance and economy review the transitional measures for unifying the Northeast monetary system was decided to have two measures: 1. The Ministry of Finance should quickly negotiate with the Central Bank to redeem Manchukuo currency and Soviet military scrip within a fixed period. 2. The Ministry of Finance should formulate appropriate measures for adjusting the exchange rate between Northeast circulating notes and legal tender, and implement them at an appropriate time. (5) The proposal to re-evaluate the value of assets and adjust the capital of the accelerated transportation of industrial and mining enterprises was approved. (6) The Ministry of Finance's proposal to formulate the "Methods for Closing the National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure for the 35th Year" was approved. (7) The Executive Yuan sent a letter on the "Measures for Handling Financial Penalties." (8) The "Organic Law of the Ministry of National Defense" was sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>

(4) If an agency issues a treasury warrant from its ordinary fund deposit to transfer funds from place A to place B, and it is still deposited and used in the National Treasury, the remaining expenses should be returned to the total revenue of the 36th year before the end of April of the 36th year, and the agency and the National Treasury should separately report to the Ministry of Finance and the National Treasury Headquarters for verification. (5) The special fund deposits, except for construction funds and other funds, are handled in accordance with the ordinary fund deposit in accordance with Articles 2, 3, and 4. The unused funds at the end of the 35th year shall be transferred to the 36th year for use. (6) The funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with emergency orders should be supplemented by the relevant department in the form of a budget estimate and submitted for approval before the end of January of the 36th year.

(8) The funds that should have been received in the 35th year but have not been paid shall be processed as revenue for the 35th year if they are paid before the end of February of the 36th year, and as revenue for the 36th year if they are paid after the deadline. (9) These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council.</p>

According to the results of the examination by Chinese and American doctors, there were no injuries on the girl's body and her clothes were not damaged. After the case was disclosed in the newspapers, students of National Peking University held a meeting to protest the matter. The U.S. military authorities have not yet issued an order prohibiting U.S. military personnel and their families from going out. However, according to U.S. Army and Navy personnel, if a demonstration is held, this order will be issued.</p>
<h3>Report on Fu Zuoyi's Discussion of Military and Political Affairs in Chahar Province; Commander's Office of the 12th War Area to Move to Zhangjiakou Next Month; Efforts to Eliminate Water Damage in Suiyuan's Western Region and Houtao Area</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 28th] It is reported that Commander Fu Zuoyi came to Beiping to confer with the 11th War Area on joint defense matters. On the afternoon of the 28th, he flew back to Zhangjiakou. It is reported that Mr. Fu met with reporters before his departure and answered the broad range of questions raised by the reporters one by one.</p>
<p>(1) Military Affairs: Mr. Fu first addressed the rumors of a so-called joint defense conference among Taiyuan and the northwestern provinces, saying, "There was no such meeting at all." He also stated, "How can Deng Baoshan leave Yulin?" He continued, stating that all sixteen county towns in Chahar Province are in the hands of the National Army and that the communist forces in the hinterland of Chahar Province are very scattered. However, the communist forces still have some strength in the border areas of the province. In the grasslands north of Chahar, only two regiments under Yun Ze's command are active. In Zuoyun and Youyu near Datong, there are about ten thousand communist troops. Currently, the area between Datong and Zhangjiakou can still be secured. The area between Datong and Taiyuan belongs to the 12th War Area, and there is no plan to open it up. The Duolun area is currently defended by the 12th Army and is temporarily under the Northeast Headquarters. Yulin is within the boundaries of the 12th War Area, and supplies are still the responsibility of the 12th War Area, while command is temporarily under the Northwest Headquarters. The Commander's Office of the 12th War Area will officially move to Zhangjiakou in January next year. A command post will be established in the Guihua area, with Chairman Dong in charge. The 12th War Area will also be divided into pacification zones to promote pacification work separately. However, the candidates for dividing the zones have not yet been decided. At present, the government still hopes to resolve political issues through peaceful means, so the speculation of the outside world regarding the actions of the National Army is mostly inaccurate because the current situation cannot be viewed from a purely military perspective.</p>
<p>(2) Political Affairs: Mr. Fu stated that the newly announced candidates for the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments have not yet taken office because many of them are attending the National Assembly in Nanjing and have not returned. The policy guidelines for Chahar Province will also be discussed after the new provincial committee members arrive. Currently, there are no major difficulties in promoting political work in Chahar Province because the land issue in Chahar Province is not yet a problem. In the past, the Communist Party only carried out liquidation struggles on material goods, food, and money in Chahar Province and did not redistribute land. Those who lost land had sold it themselves, so today's handling is easier. The current provincial government has sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of the land situation. This year, Chahar's land tax and military service are exempt. The various measures formulated by the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee are generally applicable to Chahar Province, and those that are not suitable can be flexibly adapted. At present, the people urgently need stability, and the Chahar Provincial Government is working hard to achieve this. As for financial matters, Chahar Province's current income is equal to zero. The source of funds for the province next year, the land tax, will not be levied until after October, so the situation can be described as extremely difficult. Both Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have not prohibited the export of grain, but because the government is purchasing large quantities of military grain locally, most of the people's surplus grain is sold locally, so the amount exported is not large.</p>
<p>(3) Construction: Mr. Fu stated that the Longyan Iron Mine has stopped iron smelting because it only has a small iron smelting furnace with a capacity of 20 tons. Instead, it is focusing on producing iron ore. The personnel budget for the Xiahuayuan Power Plant has been finalized, and repairs began on the 20th. Currently, the boilers are in good condition, and only the switchboard needs to be replaced. It is expected to be repaired in three months, generating 10,000 kilowatts. These two major industrial sectors have been taken over by the Resources Commission for operation. In addition, the 58 factories in Zhangjiakou that were destroyed by the Communist Party have been taken over by the provincial government. Currently, personnel are being sent to various counties and townships to inquire about the scattered machinery and equipment, collect them, and organize them. These factories can be restored to operation once the Xiahuayuan Power Plant resumes power generation. However, most of these 58 factories were privately operated by the Japanese during the enemy and puppet regime era. They were small in scale and were cultivated in the hothouse of the Mengjiang government behind the closed gate of Nankou. In the future, after they are restored, it is feared that some factories will not be able to compete with the large-scale industries in the coastal and inland areas. After the factories closed down, the provincial government continued to provide relief to the unemployed workers. Some have been introduced to the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau to break stones, and those who are widowed, orphaned, or lonely are provided with food and lodging at no cost.</p>
<p>(4) Western Suiyuan: Western Suiyuan and the Houtao area were Mr. Fu's base of resistance during the war. He said with deep feeling: The people of this corner of Western Suiyuan made great contributions to the war of resistance. After the victory, when the National Army moved east, no one helped the people prevent floods, resulting in the great water damage. In the future, I will do my best to eliminate water damage and develop water conservancy in the Houtao area, converting all the canal mouths into modern steel-reinforced concrete structures. The central government has agreed to issue funds, and the Executive Headquarters has agreed to allocate flour to assist. In addition, I will try to establish good hospitals and schools in Shanba and establish an electric light company. Because of the inconvenient transportation in the Houtao area, fish, rice, meat, and vegetables are very cheap, perhaps the cheapest in the country. If the Baotou-Ningxia Railway is extended to the Houtao area, this fertile land could accommodate millions of people without any problem. When asked by reporters whether he would bring the spirit of Shanba, which had been built with years of hard work, unchanged to Zhangjiakou, Mr. Fu replied: Customs and material conditions are related. In the past, being confined to Western Suiyuan, we had no choice but to live in such hardship.</p>
<p>(5) Inner Mongolia: When asked by reporters about the Mongolian people's proposal to establish a unified Mongolian political organization and what Commander Fu's opinion was on this matter, Mr. Fu stated: I have not yet had an appropriate time to express my opinion on this issue. However, I believe that to solve the Inner Mongolia problem, it is necessary to understand that the Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan areas are currently areas where Mongolians and Han Chinese live together. It is necessary to take into account both Mongolian and Han interests, so that their benefits are mutual and complementary. If all parties can organize an inspection group to conduct on-site investigations in the three provinces, it will be beneficial to solving the problem. Currently, the Chahar Provincial Government does not have a Mongolian affairs agency, but it intends to establish temporary organizations related to Mongolian culture and welfare. Regarding the issue of Zhangbei and Qahar's restoration, I intend to seek the opinions of the Mongolian banners first before proceeding. A few days ago, representatives from the nine banners of the Chahar region and the Silingol League's Sonid Right Banner came to Zhangjiakou to request the issuance of firearms to facilitate self-defense and to request relief. Currently, the communist forces in northern Chahar only have the two independent regiments under Lingdong's Ji Xiushan and Oqir. More than a hundred people from the latter have recently surrendered their weapons to the Urad Middle Banner. The area where Suiyuan Province borders Outer Mongolia is still calm. I have ordered a ban on Chinese citizens carrying weapons in and out of the country.</p>

<h3>Envoys from Siam and the Holy See to China Presented Credentials Yesterday; The Chairman Delivered Separate Responses to the Two Envoys</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The first envoys from Siam and the Holy See to China presented their credentials on the 28th. The Siamese Ambassador, Anutra Leek, and the Papal Nuncio, Antonino Riberi, separately presented their credentials to Chairman Chiang at the National Government at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM on the 28th. Those who accompanied them were the Second Secretary of the Siamese Embassy, Pitsanu Nildilratana, the Third Secretary Arun Jareonsuk-thong, the Counselor of the Papal Nunciature, Gao Yuqian, the First Secretary, Gregory Collins, and the Second Secretary, Chen Zhemin. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wu Pingjing, Secretary-General of the National Government, Wu Siyu, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, Li Jun, Director of the Department of Protocol, Liu Naibo, Section Chief of the Bureau of Ceremonies, and Ji Zheng, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Department of Protocol, all participated in the ceremony, with Wang Section Chief serving as the interpreter. The addresses of the two envoys and Chairman Chiang's responses are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Address by the Siamese Ambassador</p>
<p>Your Excellency Chairman: I have been appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China by the Regency Council representing the King of Siam, and I am greatly honored to present my credentials to Your Excellency in person. At the same time, I am also instructed by the Regency Council to extend to Your Excellency the sincere congratulations of the King, and to wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of your country. The friendship between China and Siam has a long history, which is due to the close relationship between the two countries. For example, many of your people reside in Siam, living in peace and prosperity, and passing down their traditions from generation to generation. The harmonious relationship between the people of China and Siam is a testament to this friendly relationship, which has been further consolidated by the recently concluded Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. I assure Your Excellency that the government and myself, in the capacity of the first envoy to China, will spare no effort to maintain the friendly relations between our two countries and to strengthen them day by day. I am greatly pleased to have been entrusted with this position and to be able to inaugurate a new era of friendship between China and Siam. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency will show sympathy and guidance in the performance of my duties, and that the government and people of your country will grant full cooperation, which is what I earnestly desire.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Response</p>
<p>Your Excellency Ambassador: The Regency Council of your country, representing the King of Siam, has dispatched Your Excellency as the first Siamese Ambassador to China. I am greatly pleased to accept your credentials in person. I am most grateful for the warm sentiments and blessings conveyed by Your Excellency on behalf of your government, and I request that you convey my sincere thanks to the King and the Regency Council of your country. During the Second World War, the vicious forces of the Japanese aggressors caused great suffering to the people of your country, and the Chinese people feel infinite sympathy. This is because, as Your Excellency mentioned, the friendship between China and Siam has a long history, and there are indeed various close relationships between the two countries. Many of our people reside in Siam, living in peace and prosperity, and passing down their traditions from generation to generation, which we find most gratifying. Moreover, we firmly believe that due to the conclusion of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the formal diplomatic relations between your two countries will be established, and the friendship between the two nations of China and Siam will surely be strengthened. Your Excellency is experienced and resided in our wartime capital during our country's resistance against Japanese aggression. I am doubly pleased and welcome Your Excellency's appointment as the first Siamese Ambassador to China. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency will have a pleasant stay in China. I will give Your Excellency my heartfelt support, and my government will also give Your Excellency full assistance to complete your noble mission, which I can guarantee to Your Excellency.</p>
<p>Address by the Papal Nuncio</p>
<p>Your Excellency Chairman: I am honored to present my credentials to Your Excellency as the Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Republic of China specially appointed by Pope Pius XII. Today's grand occasion truly continues the events of seven hundred years ago. At that time, when the Western Renaissance laid the foundation for modern civilization, and the military power of Your Country's Yuan Dynasty spanned Europe and Asia, the communication between China and the West was just beginning. The Holy See sent missionaries to communicate with Your Country. Unfortunately, communication was interrupted thereafter, and the cultural exchange between Europe and Asia did not achieve results. Since the discovery of the New World and the opening of sea routes, the Holy See sent famous scholars to preach. Later, due to certain unfortunate problems, the relationship between the two sides became estranged again, and even some unpleasant events could not be avoided, which is very regrettable. Even recently, although the Holy See has repeatedly intended to exchange envoys with Your Country's government, it has not been able to do so due to various reasons. Today, when Your Country's National Assembly is formulating a constitution for the bright future of the nation next to the mausoleum of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary mentor who created the Republic, the Holy See can formally send envoys to reside in Your Country, which is truly the will of God. Under Your Excellency's wise leadership, Your Country fought a long nine-year war of resistance and won the final victory. Now, in a rapid and glorious social transformation, it is advancing freely towards the future of a civilization of several thousand years. The Pope is extremely concerned and sympathetic to Your Country's reforms and construction, and expects that the Catholic Church in Your Country will make a significant contribution. This year, the Pope selected Thomas Tien Ken-hsin as a Cardinal Archbishop to assist in the central affairs of the Holy See and to establish a normal system for the Chinese Church. He also beatified the Chinese martyr-friend, and dispatched envoys to reside in Your Country. All of these are important expressions of the Pope's respect for Your Great Country. I am honored to have encountered this grand occasion at the beginning of my mission, especially at a time when Your Excellency continues to lead the great task of nation-building, which is a great honor. The various grand statements made by Your Excellency in the past are admired by Catholics around the world, especially the broadcast speech on Victory Day, which was most welcomed. Your Excellency said, "I believe that from now on, there will be no distinction between East and West, and no distinction between races. All human beings will accelerate their close union day by day, and become brothers and sisters." This coincides with the Pope's appeal to all nations to eliminate misunderstandings and trust each other. Your Excellency also asked, "The new order of the world should be based on the love revealed by Jesus Christ." This shows the high ideals of Your Excellency, which is an example for Your Country's politicians. This common point of view is an important reason for promoting the close relationship between the Holy See and Your Country, and it is also the deep hope of the Pope for Your Excellency and all the people of Your Country. I wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of the Great Republic of China, Antonino Riberi, Papal Nuncio to China.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Response</p>
<p>Your Excellency Envoy, I am delighted to receive your credentials, accepting the appointment of the Holy See's Pope as the Plenipotentiary Minister to the Republic of China. I am deeply grateful for the friendly sentiments you just expressed. Your deep understanding of our nation's history and the fact that the esteemed Pope appointed you as the first Holy See representative to China, restoring the traditional friendship of seven hundred years, makes me feel doubly pleased. With your understanding of the enemy nation's people's love of peace and hope, you are sure to be able to carry this heavy burden with ease. The ideals of China and the Holy See are very similar. Your arrival in China coincides with the National Assembly of our nation, and I deeply hope that the friendly connections between the two sides will increase further. Your embassy is being opened at this time, which is excellent. I am deeply grateful for the esteemed Pope's meticulous concern for the Catholic Church in our nation. This concern is truly manifested in the Pope's four major measures this year, such as appointing Thomas Tien Ken-hsin as a cardinal archbishop, establishing the Chinese Church's formal party system, exalting the Chinese martyred clergy, and assigning you as the resident chairman, which I can guarantee. I wish the Pope good health and the prosperity of your country.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Over Year-End Double Pay Issue; Private Newspapers in Nanjing Suspended Publication; Mediation by Relevant Authorities Has Yet to Yield Results</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] All fourteen private newspapers in the capital suspended publication on the 28th. Only the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily News, the Nanjing Daily News (which has not yet joined the newspaper association), and the Social Daily News continued publication. The reason for the suspension was that the workers presented conditions to the employers, requesting double pay at the end of the year and a 60% salary increase starting in December. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned more than a hundred workers to discuss and mediate, but no results were achieved. At 8:00 PM, the Bureau invited the presidents of the various newspapers to a meeting, where the employers stated that they could increase salaries by 40% of the current month's salary, but double pay at the end of the year was impossible. As a result, work did not resume that night. On the morning of the 28th, the employers held another meeting to discuss a solution. At that time, it was decided (1) to increase salaries by 40%, (2) to not agree to double pay at the end of the year, and (3) to limit the resumption of publication to tonight, otherwise the authorities would seal the factories, and the workers' food and lodging would be suspended from the 29th until work resumed. In the afternoon, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Garrison Headquarters came forward to mediate, summoning representatives from the workers' side to negotiate, but no agreement was reached. The employers continued to negotiate at the Shanghai Hotel in the evening, while the workers' representatives were also at a certain hotel. As of 8:00 PM in the afternoon, there were still no results.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the labor-management dispute of the private newspapers, the Central Propaganda Department specially dispatched Section Chief Zhou at 9:00 PM on the 28th to continue discussing solutions with Zhang You-shuang, the president of the Nanjing People's News and representative of the fourteen newspapers, and two representatives of the workers' side, but no concrete results were achieved. However, an agreement has been reached on the issue of salary increases. As for the issue of double pay at the end of the year, the employers have also expressed a willingness to compromise, and only the name "double pay" remains to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Li Di-jun Returns from Comforting Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; Details the Process; Reports to the Chairman in Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Di-jun, our country's envoy to Cuba, was dispatched two months ago to comfort overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Mr. Li held a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 11:00 AM yesterday, detailing the comforting process and the situation of the local overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Mr. Li first stated: The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have been separated from their motherland for a long time due to the War of Resistance, but their patriotic enthusiasm has not diminished as a result. During the two months, the comforting group reached more than forty places. When the overseas Chinese saw the comforting group, it was as if they were seeing the parents of their motherland. Everyone was extremely excited, warmly welcomed them, and sincerely thanked the motherland's government for not forgetting the overseas Chinese. The further away the overseas Chinese were from the political center of Batavia, the deeper their patriotism was.</p>
<p>Strong Patriotism</p>
<p>The environment in which the overseas Chinese found themselves was quite complex: During the war, they suffered extremely heavy sacrifices, and their material losses were even greater. Wealthy and intelligent overseas Chinese were imprisoned in concentration camps by the enemy. In West Borneo, more than 700 overseas Chinese were beheaded and killed by the enemy. However, after the victory, due to the Indonesian revolutionary movement, the overseas Chinese were in great pain under the struggle of the Allied forces (i.e., the British army), the Dutch East Indies Provisional Government, and the Indonesian government. There are a total of two million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, of which 1.2 million came from the motherland and 800,000 were born locally. The overseas Chinese have a high economic status, and their educational level is superior to that of overseas Chinese in other countries. Intellectuals can speak fluent Mandarin and are proficient in Dutch, English, Malay, German, and other languages. In the past, there seemed to be a wide gap between the locally born overseas Chinese and the newcomers (i.e., those who went to the Dutch East Indies from China), and they did not get along well. This was because the locally born overseas Chinese grew up under the rule of the Dutch East Indies government and were isolated from the motherland. However, since the war and the Indonesian independence movement, their attitude has changed, and their national concept has gradually become stronger. Now, they are all learning Chinese characters and studying the situation in China.</p>
<p>The Situation in Indonesia</p>
<p>In the past two or three months, the situation in the Dutch East Indies has become more stable. The Netherlands signed a ceasefire agreement with Indonesia on October 15 and a draft political agreement on December 15, but the official signing will have to wait until the Dutch Parliament passes it. Although local conflicts are still inevitable, they will not affect the lives and property of the overseas Chinese. After the political agreement is signed, the Netherlands will recognize the establishment of an Indonesian Republic on the three islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura. By January 1, 1949, a United States of Indonesia will be formed, and all other islands can participate as a unit on an equal footing, except for the Republic. The Dutch royal family will be a liaison organization for the United States. However, the military and political affairs of Indonesia itself are extremely complex. The local armed forces are divided into regular troops, militia, and extremist elements. These extremist elements desperately hoped that China would assist them, but in the past year, China's own problems have not been resolved and it has been unable to help, which has inevitably led to disappointment. In retaliation, they often harass our overseas Chinese. This time, Mr. Li summoned leaders from various places to explain in detail, saying: According to the teachings of the Founding Father, China is very sympathetic to the revolutions of any small and weak nation, especially Asian nations. China and the Dutch East Indies have a history of economic and cultural exchanges that dates back 1,500 years. The Chinese government absolutely hopes to continue to maintain friendship and cooperate with each other in the future, and to do its best to assist, but the degree of assistance must be based on guaranteeing the lives and property of the overseas Chinese. Mr. Li has summarized ten points of opinion and submitted them to the Indonesian Prime Minister, who has expressed his apology and believes that the same incidents will not happen again in the future. He has decided to gradually implement the opinions put forward. Indonesia will also send a delegation to visit China next year. There are more than fifty political parties in Indonesia, including the Indonesian Chinese Party, which has about 2,000 members.</p>
<p>Points of Depression</p>
<p>The problems that overseas Chinese find difficult to solve are: (1) Overseas Chinese in both the Dutch East Indies area, the Indonesian area, and the border area (the border between the two governments) are treated unfairly, with those in the Indonesian area being better off. (2) The issue of nationality: According to recent Indonesian law, any Chinese born in Indonesia should be an Indonesian citizen. Those who do not wish to be Indonesian citizens must make a public statement before the end of April next year. However, although overseas Chinese do not wish to be Indonesian citizens, they are also afraid that making a statement will be detrimental to themselves, so they still maintain dual citizenship. (3) Although the Indonesian revolution claims to have been influenced by China's Xinhai Revolution and believes that it is also the Three Principles of the People, it still imposes controls on the economic status of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese earnestly hope that Chinese government economic experts will provide assistance and support and plan to send representatives back to China next spring for inspection.</p>
<p>The comforting group has solved some problems for the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. For example, when the enemy occupied the Dutch East Indies, the local authorities adopted a scorched earth policy. Most of the losses suffered were the property of overseas Chinese. After negotiations, the Dutch East Indies government has agreed to compensate. At present, 30% of the factories have begun to be repaired, and 60% can be restored within three or four months, and the restoration will continue thereafter, but not all of them can be compensated. The authorities have also agreed to compensate for the materials requisitioned from the overseas Chinese by the Japanese. In principle, the authorities have also recognized the loss compensation, and the overseas Chinese have now begun to report.</p>
<p>Remittance Problems</p>
<p>As for the remittance problem, the authorities have agreed to open it from January next year, but stipulate that all overseas Chinese can remit a total of 10,000 guilders, and then gradually increase it depending on the situation. According to the current official price, one US dollar is equal to 2.66 guilders.</p>
<p>Mr. Li also stated that before returning to China, he had submitted 18 points regarding the overseas Chinese to the Dutch East Indies government, and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies had agreed to handle them.</p>
<p>Mr. Li went to Nanjing by train last night to report to the Chairman and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to make suggestions. He will come to Shanghai again in the middle of next month to discuss the Luo fund issue with Central Bank Governor Bei Tsu-yi. Mr. Li also stated: All parties are satisfied with this comforting work, and it cannot be said that the task of comforting the overseas Chinese has been completed, but rather that it is the beginning of solving the problems of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Our Delegates to the UN General Assembly, Liu Kai, etc., Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our City] Liu Kai, our Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from San Francisco on a US plane at 3:35 PM today. The plane departed from San Francisco on the 26th of this month and will land at Jiangwan Airport. There are a total of eighteen passengers, including Vice Minister Liu, Deputy Delegates to the General Assembly, personnel from the Bank of China and Citibank, and specialized technical staff from UNRRA. The plane is a C/54 type transport plane with the tail number NC7906 and is carrying approximately one thousand pounds of letters and prizes. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has prepared to send personnel to the airport to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dong Lin Appointed as Advisor</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced the appointment of Sun Bingqian as Consul General in Bangkok. Dong Lin, former envoy to the Dutch East Indies, was appointed as Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wang Nianqu, former First Secretary of the Embassy in Iran, was transferred to Bern, the capital of Switzerland, remaining in his original position.</p>
<h3>Principal Culprits in the Shibuya Incident Indicted; Police Chief and Others "Violated the Objectives of the Occupation Forces"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] The three-member committee of the Yokohama Military Tribunal formally indicted three senior officials of the Shibuya Police Station on the 5th, who witnessed the shooting incident between Japanese police and Allied citizens on July 19, saying that they "violated the objectives of the occupation forces." The three are Shibuya Police Chief Soji Tsuchiya, Deputy Chief (name omitted), and Chunwei Miyagi, the police inspector in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs at the station. The Chief and Deputy Chief of the police station are accused of maliciously and erroneously ordering the police under their jurisdiction to fire excessively and unnecessarily at the crowd (including United Nations people), resulting in the deaths of seven people and injuries to several people. This action clearly disrupted peace and caused terror among the people in the area and therefore violated the self-imposed goals of the occupation forces. It is reported that a total of forty Taiwanese people were involved in the Shibuya incident, and they were recently sentenced by another three-member committee in Tokyo to two and three years of labor or deportation.</p>
<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Stallholders Sue Finance Minister Cuaderno: Order to Eliminate Stallholders Exceeds Legal Provisions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 28th] Eight hundred Chinese stallholders recently sued Philippine Finance Minister Cuaderno in the Manila court. The city government accountant and the local market officials believe this is their last resort to prevent these officials from seizing their stalls in the local market. The overseas Chinese stallholders pointed out that the mandatory order issued by Finance Minister Cuaderno on November 26, which declared that all stalls in any public market should be vacated by the original owners, and that anyone setting up a stall after December 31 would be considered an ineligible applicant, does not comply with Article 37 of the Philippine Republic's regulations, therefore, his order is invalid and has no binding power on private individuals. They said that the matter involved in this order exceeds the powers prescribed by law.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Patriots Yang Ziping and Others: Fourteen Years of Unredressed Grievances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] In the second year after the September 18th Incident fourteen years ago, when the League of Nations Lytton Commission came to the Northeast, local citizen Li Ziping and others, in order to report the true situation of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, secretly met with Dr. Lytton at his residence and explained everything. After the Lytton Commission left, Yang and others were arrested by the Japanese military police. Later, Japanese military policemen Katoro Tsuruji and Miyata Churyo, among others, subjected them to inhumane torture, and many people were implicated and arrested. Yang and others were then taken to the Japanese special service agency. The agency's chief, Major General Miura, disregarding international law, illegally tried them, falsely accusing Yang Ziping and others of being spies for the United States and Britain and having connections with the Kuomintang Party, and charged them with crimes against national security. On July 7 of the same year, Yang Ziping, Xu Fanjiu, and others were paraded in shackles to create terror, and then executed en masse. This tragic case has been buried for fourteen years. Now, after being reported by the victim's family, Yang Tingmin, the Northeast Headquarters War Crimes Tribunal has filed a public prosecution. However, the defendants Katoro, Tada, Miura, and others are all at large. It is reported that the War Crimes Tribunal has submitted the matter to the relevant authorities and telegraphed General MacArthur's headquarters to find ways to track them down.</p>
<h3>Bangkok Overseas Chinese Schools Issue Joint Statement Demanding Revision of Education Regulations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] Sixty-seven overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok recently issued a joint statement expressing their attitude towards the Ministry of Education's recent order requiring overseas Chinese schools to register with the ministry within fifteen days. The joint statement stated that they could not register under the current education regulations promulgated by the former Thai dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram. They demanded (1) that Chinese language classes in the curriculum of overseas Chinese primary schools should be twelve hours per week, cancelling the original provision of five and a half hours per week; (2) that principals and teachers below the fourth grade of primary school should not be required to be proficient in Siamese; and (3) that overseas Chinese children should have the freedom to choose the school they attend, whether it be an overseas Chinese school or a Siamese school. The statement expressed a deep desire for the current education regulations to be revised so that the overseas Chinese education problem could be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dalian American Ship Incident: Washington Has Not Received Detailed Report</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that regarding the Dalian incident, the State Department has not yet made a final conclusion because it has not yet received a detailed official report from that area. Acheson said that the American Consul in Dalian, Penninghoff, has not yet reported directly to the State Department. Acheson declined to comment on whether the Soviet authorities in Dalian had issued an ultimatum to the American naval mail ship ordering it to leave immediately.</p>

<h3>Huwei and Datong Banks: Business Quite Developed</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Yesterday, this newspaper published a Chongqing dispatch stating: "All Shanghai branches of the Yu Jianguo, Chengda, Huwei, and Datong banks have successively suspended exchange." This newspaper's reporter specially inquired about the truth from the financial circles of this city and learned that Huwei and Datong banks have been established for many years, are known for their stability, have ample reserves, and their business is quite developed. There has never been any news of the above-mentioned situation. The Chongqing dispatch is probably based on inaccurate reporting.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Increasingly Serious French-Vietnamese Conflict</h3>
<p>The scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict is expanding day by day, and it is no longer comparable to ordinary incidents. The consequences will not only endanger peace in a corner of the Far East, but will also be sufficient to affect the development of the entire world political situation, so it has attracted the attention of countries around the world. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has asked the Cabinet to study the current Vietnam problem based on the reports submitted by the British Ambassador to France and Lord Killearn, the Special Envoy to Southeast Asia. American Acting Secretary of State Acheson also told the press that although the Vietnam problem is a matter for the French government, the American government has maintained close contact with the French government and hopes that Mr. Moutet, the French Minister of Overseas Colonies, who is currently investigating the truth at the site of the French-Vietnamese conflict, will submit a report as soon as possible. Although this passage is very tactful diplomatic rhetoric, lightly describing it and not carrying a particularly serious meaning, the anxiety in its heart regarding the situation in Vietnam cannot be concealed. In China, because 435,800 compatriots reside in Vietnam, "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat are also affected." In any conflict that occurs in Vietnam, the lives and property of overseas Chinese compatriots will inevitably suffer major losses. Although the Chinese Consul General in Hanoi has repeatedly made suggestions to both the French and Vietnamese sides, advocating the demarcation of a neutral zone in Vietnam so that overseas Chinese and peace-loving Vietnamese people can live there, this safety plan has never been realized, further causing the Chinese government to worry about the safety of the lives and property of these many overseas Chinese compatriots, so it has no choice but to take concrete and effective measures to protect them.</p>
<p>From the perspective of countries such as China, Britain, and the United States, of course everyone hopes that both the French and Vietnamese sides can lay down their arms. On the Vietnamese side, no more terrorist actions should be taken; on the French side, no more high-pressure policies should be adopted. With a spirit of peace and friendship, negotiations should be reopened to seek a thorough solution to the Vietnam problem. In fact, for the sake of France's actual interests, France should also quickly find a way to achieve a peaceful resolution. For example, the Political Committee of the French Communist Party passed a resolution also advocating that the French government should immediately hold peace talks with the Viet Minh government, so that both sides can cooperate loyally within the scope of the French Union, and stating that some reactionaries in France directly oppose the Viet Minh government and that taking violent and provocative actions is also detrimental to the national interest. After taking office as Prime Minister, the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, also assured the French people that the French government would definitely strive to achieve the early restoration of peace in accordance with the spirit of the French-Vietnamese agreement. Whether Prime Minister Blum can fulfill the promises he has made domestically and internationally, the current French-Vietnamese conflict is the best touchstone.</p>
<p>However, based on comprehensive reports from all sides, the attitude that France has adopted towards Vietnam can be seen in the following aspects: (1) The French military authorities, under government orders, urgently transferred reinforcements to Vietnam; (2) French Minister of Overseas Colonies Moutet gave a speech in Saigon, firmly rejecting the Vietnamese people's demands for independence, and saying that "France will never grant the people of Cochinchina and southern Annam the right to national self-determination"; (3) French aircraft have officially participated in the war, bombing Viet Minh troop concentration points over Hanoi; (4) A preliminary report released by the French government investigation team also stated that Vietnam should bear full responsibility for the French-Vietnamese conflict; (5) The press officer of the Viet Minh government's delegation in France was arrested by French police in Marseille.</p>
<p>From the above, it is undoubtedly that the French government, in order to maintain its prestige in Vietnam, is bound to act recklessly to the end. On the Vietnamese side, the Vietnamese people have been inspired by nationalism! They are fighting to the end for the liberation of the nation and will never retreat in the face of difficulties or give up halfway. President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic issued a Christmas broadcast on the 25th of this month, demanding that French troops withdraw from the entire territory of Vietnam. In addition, Mr. Nguyen Tuong Tam, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, is also active in Nanjing. In addition to appealing to China and the United States to mediate the French-Vietnamese conflict, he also advocated the organization of a "National Front Government" to prepare to resolve grievances and make peace with the Viet Minh government, in order to fight for independence with a common goal and fight France to the end. At the same time, Viet Minh troops scattered throughout the country have taken the offensive, engaging in a desperate battle with the French army, making the scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict grow larger and larger.</p>
<p>If this worrying situation is allowed to develop naturally without finding ways to remedy it, it will have very serious consequences, which are unimaginable. Therefore, at this critical moment, French politicians should be able to have a broad and long-term vision, make decisive decisions, and quickly bring an end to the bloody tragedy in Vietnam. Standing from the position of a third party, we would like to offer advice to the French authorities: First, the French authorities in charge must know that in today's world after the end of World War II, the era of imperialism has long become a historical relic. France must not treat Vietnam by following the colonial policies of the past. If the responsibility for the occurrence of this French-Vietnamese conflict is to be investigated, then the blame lies not with Vietnam, but with the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu, and the Commissioner to Cochinchina, Cédile, who should bear full responsibility. Because they have not changed their past treatment of colonies in their treatment of Vietnam, which has aroused the public indignation of the Vietnamese people, which has led to this unfortunate incident. Second, the thinking and politics of the French people have made considerable progress since the war. In particular, the new French constitution has far-reaching ideals and is admired by countries around the world; however, it does not yet have a thorough understanding of the sacred principle of national self-determination. The speech given by French Overseas Minister Moutet in Saigon not only cannot have a stabilizing effect, but will only add fuel to the fire and unnecessarily deepen the Vietnamese people's hatred of France. Third, we also know that the Vietnam problem is sufficient to cause political turmoil in France, but the Blum government is blindly adopting a high-pressure policy, attempting to resolve the Vietnam problem by force. We believe that its result will inevitably be failure, because the morale of the Vietnamese people cannot be insulted and cannot be conquered by airplanes, artillery, and tanks.</p>
<p>In short, the situation in Vietnam is becoming more and more serious. The French authorities in charge should remain calm, reconsider the policies they have adopted, and make a prudent decision quickly, so as to prevent the situation from deteriorating further and falling into an unrecoverable predicament.</p>

<h3>Thorough Suppression of Bandits in Hongze Lake: More Than 20,000 Bandits Annihilated: A Major Disaster Removed from the Jiangsu-Anhui Border</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin News] Hongze Lake crosses the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, with a vast area and dense reeds, traditionally an area where bandits roam. Salt merchants consider it a long and dangerous journey, and they often use armed escorts to ensure safety. However, robberies and kidnappings still occur from time to time. Although the security authorities have sent personnel to lead troops to suppress them, and have organized armed self-defense by fishing households, the bandits have fled and returned, and they have not been completely eliminated. This is truly a major hidden danger in the heartland of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and local people are deeply worried. According to visitors near the lake, in mid-month, the national army, in coordination with local armed forces, launched an encirclement and suppression of the bandits, forcing them into the depths of the reed marshes. More than 20,000 bandits were annihilated. Only a hundred or so injured bandits managed to escape, fleeing towards Si, Su, and Lianshui. The pursuers intercepted them along the way, killing many more. When they reached Zhangguandang in the western border of Lianshui, they were captured by the local troops. Only the bandit leader, Shi Zhenguo, and a dozen or so others escaped into the middle of the Before and After Six Ponds River. Everyone was overjoyed. A major disaster has been removed from the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, and water traffic on the lake can proceed unhindered. The lake is rich in fish, gorgon fruit, firewood, and grass, and can be safely harvested, which will provide considerable help to the livelihood of the people.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Fleeing Traitors: Confiscation and Disposal of Illegal Assets: Jiangsu High Court President Sun Dispels Doubts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 28th] Sun Honglin, President of the Jiangsu High Court, was previously dispatched as the chief examiner for the county magistrate examination in Jiangsu Province. After completing his official duties, he went to Nanjing to ask for instructions and returned to Suzhou on the evening of the 27th. This newspaper's reporter asked Sun about the question of how to close the cases of some traitors that were not captured even after orders for arrest were issued, and how their illegal assets would be disposed of, since the work of eliminating traitors in Jiangsu Province had been going on for more than a year. Sun explained: If a traitorous criminal cannot be found during the investigation period, and the prosecutor has conducted a comprehensive investigation and believes that the evidence of the crime is conclusive, then in addition to filing a public prosecution and transferring the case to the criminal court, he can also issue an arrest warrant in the name of the chief prosecutor. After receiving the indictment, if the criminal court believes that it is indeed impossible to bring the accused to justice, it can issue an arrest warrant again in the name of the president of the court. The trial process will be suspended until the case is solved. However, if the criminal court believes that there is still a possibility of bringing the accused to justice, then it should still follow the judicial procedure of three summons and three arrests. As for the illegal assets of these traitors who have already been wanted, the prosecutor's office will seal them up, but will not carry out confiscation. It must be after the arrest and return to the court, and the criminal court hears the case and announces the confiscation of the property before it can be executed.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Transfers Three County Magistrates</h3>

<h3>Suzhou Organizes Committee to Relieve the Poor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 28th] The weather has been very cold in recent weeks, and frozen bodies have been found on the streets from time to time. Winter relief is already imminent. However, due to the difficult social economy and the decline of commerce, it has not been started for a long time. Cao Yongxiang, commander of the Suzhou Garrison, in view of this, gathered party and community leaders on the morning of the 28th to discuss solutions, and immediately decided to organize the Wu County Poor Relief Committee. Cao was publicly elected as the chairman of the committee, and County Magistrate Shen Chengneng and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Shoupeng were elected as the vice-chairmen. The main targets for relief are the elderly, young, sick, and homeless vagrants and beggars, with a quota of 600 people temporarily set. The budget is 100 million yuan, which will be donated or raised in full by the Entertainment Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and gentry. This relief is not limited to winter, but is a permanent organization. However, its work is not purely passive relief, but its main purpose is to gradually cultivate production skills through part-time work and part-time study, with the aim of being completely self-sufficient after three months. Therefore, in addition to shelter, preparations are being made to establish a large-scale vocational training center, which is said to be a fundamental foundation for establishing cleanliness in Suzhou City.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Huge Fraud: Falsely Claiming the Name of the Ministry of National Defense: Claiming to Organize a Military Force to Embezzle Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingpu News] The county government arrested Gao Er, a perpetrator of large-scale fraud under the name of the Ministry of National Defense, on the 25th. He is a native of Tainan Township in this county. He usually does not engage in legitimate business, but specializes in deception. Recently, he had a whimsical idea and actually persuaded villagers in the township, claiming that he knew a certain senior official in the Ministry of National Defense, and was now on a secret mission to organize a "Youth Party Army" to recruit able-bodied young men in the township. It would be established in the first month of next year, and each person would have firearms and uniforms to work in the township, monitoring officials at all levels, with great power, and would not go out to work, so they could be exempt from military service, with a salary of 300,000 yuan per month. There was a superior captain who was now in Shanghai, ordering him to recruit in the township, and each recruit would first pay a handling fee of 240,000 yuan to pay for his travel arrangements and registration fees, etc. This was a bunch of nonsense, wildly exaggerated. The ignorant villagers did not know the truth and fell into his trap. More than 20 people in Songjiang, Tianwei District (bordering Xiangnan) were deceived and paid to "enlist." The matter was discovered by the authorities. Because the perpetrator dared to falsely claim a name and deceive the public for money, he was really defying the law and discipline. He was handed over to the military court for interrogation and punishment. It is said that there are still many accomplices who are being secretly detained.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin County Tax Collection Embezzlement Case: Errors in Reported Figures</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] At a meeting of the county provisional council on the 23rd, Councilor Zou Zongshe stated that embezzlement had occurred in the collection of land tax in kind. Based on the county's total amount of grain collected in kind, the price of rice was inflated by 4,000 yuan per picul. Calculating with a total of 270,000 piculs, the total would be 1.08 million yuan. Discounting by 30%, it would reach 300,000 yuan. At the time, a neighboring councilor pointed out that there were considerable discrepancies in the figures due to calculation errors. Upon investigation by the reporter with the Land and Food Office, the total amount of land tax collected in kind, requisitioned, and public grain for this year in this county is 235,711 piculs and six dou, with 23,571 piculs and one dou and six sheng accumulated in grain, totaling 259,282 piculs and seven dou and six sheng. Even if all of it was embezzled, the amount would only be 100.04 million yuan. The initial statement of 1.08 million yuan, discounted by 30% to 300,000 yuan, was indeed an error. At the time, the recording did not pay attention to the correction. After it was published in this newspaper on the 26th, it caused a stir in society. The reporter, considering the significant impact of these figures, specially investigated the detailed amount of grain collected in kind with the Land and Food Office to clarify the truth, as detailed above. Furthermore, Deputy Director Hong of the Land and Food Office was summoned back to the town by the province on the 26th to provide a detailed account of the situation and await a thorough investigation. Additionally, the person in charge of the Land and Food Office stated that since the beginning of the collection, the total amount collected and the amount of land tax borrowed in advance is approximately below 100,000 piculs, and by the end of this month, it may reach around 150,000 piculs.</p>

<h3>Multiple Unidentified Male Corpses Discovered in Mud Cave on the Border of Wujin and Danyang. Rumors Say They Were All Victims of Bandit Kidnappings and Murders</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch] In the northwestern border area of this county, bordering the Fangxian District of Danyang County, there is a small mountain called Mud Mountain, which connects to Jiashan, which belongs to Wujin. The mountain produces Guanyin powder, which is white, delicate, and tasteless and can be used to make wine medicine pills. The poor can use it to fill their stomachs. During agricultural off-seasons, the local people often take the extraction of Guanyin powder as a side business.

<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Continues Meeting. Soviet and Polish Representatives Take Passive Stance. Baruch Firmly Opposes Veto Power. New U.S. Proposal Passed, Awaiting Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] The drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a closed meeting today and passed its final report to the Security Council. At that time, the French representative, Parodi, with the support of the British representative, strenuously argued that the report should not involve the issue of veto power. This issue has caused debate between France, Britain, Canada, and Poland on one side and China, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Australia on the other. Soviet representative, Alexander, refused to participate in the debate. According to reports, the French representative had previously submitted a clause to the U.S. delegation, arguing that in the event of an act of aggression constituting an international crime, "the offending country should not be able to evade the consequences of its unlawful act by reasonable means." The U.S. representative suggested adding the phrase "by veto power or other means" to define the term "reasonable means." However, the French representative firmly opposed this, believing that including this phrase would give the impression that the Atomic Energy Commission intended to amend the United Nations Charter. Conversely, U.S. representative Baruch strongly supported the U.S. proposal to maintain the principle of unanimity as stipulated in the Charter. Finally, the committee passed the new U.S. proposal, with the addition of a note stating that the Soviet Union did not participate in the debate and that all other points were unanimously agreed upon except for the inclusion of the phrase "by veto power or other means." However, this matter is still awaiting final decision by the entire committee. Representatives from Britain and Canada have indicated that they will abide by the majority and comply with this resolution, but the French representative stated that he must consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before deciding on a course of action.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] U.S. representative Baruch today candidly announced at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission that the United States could not relinquish the secrets of the atomic bomb unless the five major powers did not exercise their veto power over the punishment of those who violated the atomic energy agreement. The committee held a closed meeting today to discuss the U.S. proposal for atomic energy control for eight hours. Baruch requested that this issue be voted on in public, stating: "Under any system that allows cunning means to nullify punishment, I cannot recommend to the American people and the Senate that we relinquish this powerful weapon and make public the great knowledge of producing atomic energy. What we are asking for is that when voting on whether a country or its allies should be punished for violating the agreement, they should not use their own veto power. Conversely, if it is believed that violators should have this right, then they can vote against our position, or abstain from or refuse to vote." Baruch's so-called refusal to participate in the vote clearly refers to the Soviet Union and Poland, as the Soviet Union has stated that it will not participate in the vote, and Poland has indicated that it will abstain from voting. Earlier, Baruch also stated: The core of the issue lies in whether the sanctity of the treaty or the veto should be sacred, and he said in a sharp tone: "I do not know why a country that intends to uphold the treaty needs a veto power. Because only countries that intend to violate the treaty need the protection of the veto power." Before Baruch spoke, the British and French representatives agreed to ban the use of veto power but opposed explicitly stipulating it in the final draft. The British representative stated that the reason for taking this position was to seek unanimity and avoid Soviet opposition.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The executive committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting this morning to discuss the technical part of the report passed by the political subcommittee on the control of atomic energy, and immediately approved it. Representatives from Poland and the Soviet Union were not present, so all parties continue to speculate on the future attitudes of the two countries. In addition, the executive committee decided to continue the meeting this afternoon, and the issues to be discussed are two: (1) Discuss the draft resolution jointly proposed by the United States and Canada, which was passed in the previous closed meeting, and the principles it follows are roughly similar to the plan of U.S. representative Baruch, but it does not mention the issue of veto power; (2) Decide on the attitude that the executive committee should take towards the following two issues, namely (a) the plan proposed by U.S. representative Baruch, (b) the issue of permanent members of the Security Council exercising veto power on sanctions. If the executive committee cannot reach an agreement, and the Soviet Union and Poland are absent again, the French delegation will propose a compromise plan, dividing sanctions into two types, large and small, stipulating that permanent members of the Security Council may use veto power for small sanctions, but not for large sanctions.</p>
<h3>Vietnam War Expands Southward. Fierce Battles Along the Entire Front in Northern and Central Vietnam</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] According to news from the French side today: The war in Vietnam has expanded to southern Cochinchina, with 24 civilian casualties. The uncompromising attitudes of the French and Vietnamese sides are becoming increasingly apparent, and French troops have imposed martial law in Saigon. On Christmas Eve, three cars carrying Annamese, Indians, and overseas Chinese on a highway near Saigon were attacked, resulting in 20 deaths, including one Briton. Another car carrying a group of priests and Annamese children was ambushed, killing two children and seriously injuring four priests. French officials explained that these nighttime sniper attacks were attempts by Viet Minh guerrillas to cut off transportation throughout southern Cochinchina or as a preliminary step to carry out such attacks throughout northern Vietnam. In addition, scattered reports indicate multiple fierce clashes along the entire front in northern and central Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, broadcast a statement on a secret radio station, demanding that French troops withdraw from all of Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Root Cause of the French-Vietnamese Conflict</h3>
<p>American Newspapers Believe Compromise Hopes Are Slim</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] The New York Times carried an editorial today on the Vietnam situation, predicting that the conflict there cannot be resolved for the time being and will expand. The newspaper's reporter, who met with French officials in Vietnam and various leaders of the underground movements in Cochinchina and Annam earlier this month, believes that the root cause of the Franco-Vietnamese dispute lies in the status of Cochinchina. Therefore, the Viet Minh government may order Annamese underground activists in the rice-producing region of Cochinchina to begin operations and open a second front. When the newspaper's reporter was in Vietnam, the ceasefire agreement in Cochinchina was still respected, but the illegal "Annam Executive Committee" was still engaged in active political activities, while the French authorities used high-pressure tactics to deal with those who opposed the pro-French Republic of Cochinchina, such as prohibiting newspapers from publishing words that the French side considered critical. As for arresting Annamese guerrillas, it was a common occurrence. As for the methods of both sides, from a neutral standpoint, they both seem to be excessive. Therefore, France and the Viet Minh are constantly in an explosive state of tension. The root of the Vietnam War lies in the Viet Minh's dissatisfaction with the Fontainebleau Agreements (the agreement between Ho Chi Minh and the French government) and the Viet Minh's attempt to incorporate Cochinchina into its republic. Of course, this attempt is difficult for France to approve. Given the wide divergence of positions on both sides, the hope of compromise seems extremely slim.</p>
<h3>Indian Newspapers Vigorously Criticize French Colonial Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] Several newspapers in central and northern India today published articles strongly condemning the actions of the French army in Vietnam. The National Daily, hosted by Nehru in Lucknow, titled its editorial "Vietnam Erupts," stating that the atrocities currently occurring in Vietnam can only be explained by France's desire to maintain its colonies in various forms and under various names. The Vietnamese people's resistance to this tyrannical policy of France should be sympathized with by all Asian nations. India hopes to strike a fatal blow to colonialism, and all Asian countries should do the same." The Delhi National Herald also stated: "If the United Nations cannot punish those who undermine peace and international agreements, the people of the world will lose their faith. Governments that fought against Nazism for six years should no longer deal with people who disagree with them in a Nazi way."</p>
<h3>British Government Pays Attention to Southeast Asian Situation. Strive to Prevent French Prestige from Being Affected. Colonial Wars Are Not Beneficial to Britain and France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] It has been learned that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will soon ask the British Cabinet to study the situation in Southeast Asia. The British Ambassador to France and Sir Killearn, the British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia, have both provided detailed reports to the government on the war in Vietnam. It is said that the situation in Southeast Asia may affect British interests, so Britain should do the following two things: (1) Britain is currently trying to promote friendly relations with Siam; (2) French prestige should not be affected.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] The Manchester Guardian commented on the situation in Vietnam today, stating, "Hardliners in Paris believe that France should never negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but those with clear heads know that it is not a good strategy to maintain France's position in Vietnam and elsewhere by force alone. In the past, both France and Britain have engaged in colonial wars of plunder, and the result was that they themselves did not suffer serious losses. However, today, the general trend of the world has changed, and any colonial war in any part of Britain and France can shake its entire structure."</p>
<h3>French Government Takes a Firm Stance. Strive to Increase Reinforcements to Vietnam. Communists Urge Restoration of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cherbourg, France, 27th] It has been learned that the French mail ship "Ile de France" is scheduled to transport 8,000 newly conscripted soldiers to Casablanca tomorrow, and then return to Toulon to transport French reinforcements to Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 28th] Regularly scheduled air services within Vietnam have been temporarily suspended from today to facilitate the use of these aircraft to transport troops. However, those specially approved by the government may continue to fly as usual.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French military authorities have been ordered by the government to urgently transfer reinforcements to Vietnam, and detailed information has always been kept secret. Paris said today that there has been no major change in the Viet Minh situation, and people here still believe that the French Colonial Department will not initiate negotiations with the leaders during its stay in Vietnam. However, some well-informed people believe that if there is an opportunity, they should make informal contact with them. The French government seems unwilling to negotiate with the Viet Minh until order is fully restored and the Viet Minh completely ceases military action. The French government will also firmly insist that any future Viet Minh government must have genuine representation before it is willing to negotiate with it. The French Communist Party does not agree with the government's shift to a tougher stance. The party's Politburo today passed a resolution strongly advocating for the prompt resumption of negotiations to achieve genuine cooperation between France and the Viet Minh. The French Foreign Ministry also disclosed two secret letters sent by Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh to French Special Envoy Sendeny in Hanoi and French Military Commander Morlière on the afternoon and evening of December 19, requesting the French Commissioners to improve the situation based on the Paris resolutions, and informing Morlière that some of the French proposals would be considered by the Viet Minh cabinet the next day. When Morlière was proofreading the letter, the lights suddenly went out, as the Viet Minh army had sabotaged the power plant and launched an offensive.</p>
<h3>Initial Results of Investigation by French Colonial Minister</h3>
<p>Believes Viet Minh Should Be Held Responsible for the Conflict</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] French Colonial Minister Garret led a delegation of the French government to Vietnam to investigate the French-Vietnamese conflict. He has been here for 48 hours since arriving and is now beginning to work actively. According to semi-official sources, Minister Garret's initial investigation has sufficiently proven that the current conflict should be held responsible by the Viet Minh government. The Viet Minh government has been organizing military institutions by taking advantage of the French-Vietnamese negotiations. The Viet Minh army's attack on the French army was carried out simultaneously in several places, which proves that this matter was planned in advance. The main clause of the French-Vietnamese Provisional Treaty stipulates that the French and Vietnamese sides should immediately cease the conflict, but the Viet Minh government has no intention of implementing the treaty. On the French side, they have always strived to reach an agreement with Vietnam. In addition, Vietnamese troops have already infiltrated the territory of Cochinchina, and although they have stopped fighting, they continue to ambush everywhere. These ambushes cannot be regarded as individual attempts. France has sent liaison delegations to contact the Viet Minh military authorities, but its members have been attacked by Viet Minh troops, resulting in injuries or deaths. This type of incident occurred in Haiphong. It is hoped that members of the Viet Minh government can break away from the control of extremists and restore their policy of agreement with France.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Establishes Administrative Institutions in Haiphong. Welcomes Garret to Come and Negotiate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] According to the Viet Minh government's underground newspaper: Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh wrote that the Viet Minh government has established administrative institutions in Haiphong (between Hanoi and Haiphong). In addition, President Ho Chi Minh has also instructed his representatives stationed in Cochinchina to launch peaceful and solemn unarmed demonstrations to present the demands of the Vietnamese people to French Colonial Minister Garret, namely "Down with the puppet government of Cochinchina," "Recall General Li Xiangyi, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam," and "Welcome Minister Garret." This order was received in Saigon, so Zhu can follow it. A spokesman for the Viet Minh government also issued a broadcast statement stating that the Viet Minh Enemy Government welcomes Minister Garret to Vietnam and invites Minister Garret to come to Haiphong to hold consultations with President Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<h3>A Great Feat by a Norwegian Explorer: Crossing the Pacific Next Spring by Raft</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. Army Department announced: Norwegian explorer, Mr. Hjelda and four other Norwegians, will set sail on a raft from Ilo, Peru to Polynesia (Oceania) in February of next year. This 4,000-mile expedition aims to investigate the original inhabitants and culture of the Polynesian Islands. Mr. Hjelda's journey seeks to provide a basis for his theory that the original inhabitants of the Pacific traveled from America, not Asia. The raft carrying these explorers will drift on the ocean for four months and will be made of the lightest wood, built according to the ancient Peruvian wooden boat style. However, the raft will be equipped with radio and life-saving equipment. Mr. Hjelda said that the purpose of their trip is to test the feasibility of this voyage and to confirm whether Peruvian culture spread to the Central Pacific.</p>
<h3>American Warship Arrives in Marseilles</h3>

<h3>Reopening Old Wounds: Churchill Actively Advocating for the Organization of the United States of Europe; Hopes for China to Become a First-Class Democracy</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] Collier's Magazine carries an essay by Churchill, reiterating his proposal for the organization of a European Federation and hoping that China will soon become a first-class democratic nation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill published an article titled "Towards the Road to the Future" in "Collier's" magazine today, again advocating for the "organization of the United States of Europe." The article stated briefly: The division between communism and Christian doctrine, as well as Western culture, is fraught with fatal consequences unprecedented in human history. France must emit a signal of freedom in Europe, as there is no other way for France to restore its inherent true glory and its original position in the world. France must uplift the German people and lead them back into the international community. As the great French writer Victor Hugo appealed to the French National Assembly in Bordeaux in 1871, organizing the United States of Europe is a vision of the highest order. The Atlantic Ocean can no longer serve as a barrier for America, and European resentment may infiltrate America. Therefore, America must use its power to eliminate the germs of the infection center, and the organization of the United States of Europe is necessary for America's security.</p>
<p>Unless the United Nations organization has a strong organization within it, it will fail. Regarding the plan to organize the United States of Europe, I believe that Europe must abolish tariff barriers, establish economic coordination, and adopt a uniform currency system. Therefore, a regenerated Europe is not opposed to Russia or the Soviets, but the organization of the United States of Europe will be opposed by the Communist Party. The Communist Party must solve the problem of famine, as this is a necessary condition for the Communist Party to rule the world. In this current period of ideological conflict, the atomic bomb is a new balancing factor. Fortunately, the atomic bomb is currently owned by the United States, which can provide the world with a considerable period of peace, but the duration of that time is currently difficult to predict. In summary, if we want to succeed on the road to the future, it is necessary to restore life and unity in Europe and the Christian world.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Current Situation in a Withered Year</h3>
<p>1946 is an extremely important year in modern history. The World War did end last year, but many of the difficult and complex issues it left behind need to be resolved this year, or at least a path to resolution needs to be opened. There is an ancient saying, "It is easy to share hardship, but difficult to share happiness." In fact, dealing with postwar problems is indeed more difficult than dealing with wartime problems. Conferences were held bustlingly throughout the year. Although the degree of achievement varied, there were some gains, such as the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were already prepared for signing. Although the peace treaties with Japan and Germany have not yet been discussed, the days for formal discussion are not far off. Although the issue of atomic energy control remains a major tangle, the future seems a little clearer since the General Assembly passed the universal disarmament proposal. These factors are worth being optimistic about. However, if we believe that the world can be peaceful from now on, we cannot help but be rash and forceful. Because in the current world, there are indeed many inherent contradictions and conflicts, and even if the surface is temporarily easing, the day of fundamental resolution is still far away. In this withered year, we might as well chat about the current world situation.</p>
<p>The World is Even More Compact Today</p>
<p>According to the observations of the "World Report Weekly" correspondent, there are several obvious characteristics of the world situation in 1946: that is, the world today has become smaller and more compact. A few years ago, there were six or seven "powerful countries" in the world, which checked each other and maintained a balance of power, but today, there are only three, or at most five, countries with the power to influence the overall world situation. As for whether a balance of power can be created, it is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is the second strongest country today. It has gathered several satellite countries and neighboring areas to form a compact political, economic, and military unit. The United States and the United Kingdom, ranked first and third, are very close in ideals, many common interests, and policies; they want to try to resist the expansionist policies of the Soviet world. Under these circumstances, the world is clearly divided into two major parts, with extremely large differences in concepts, political theories, and international actions. Although the United Nations organization has united more than fifty countries and assumed the responsibility of maintaining peace and security and promoting human progress, it is still difficult to exert its effectiveness in eliminating world boundaries for a while. In addition, the invention of the atomic bomb and other advancements in technology and science make it possible for the world situation to change at any time, and the world situation is therefore more complicated. Although everyone has the desire to solve the deadlock, they have no power to solve the deadlock.</p>
<p>The World Can Be Divided Into Four Regions</p>
<p>For the sake of explanation, we might as well divide the world into four regions: (1) a safe zone; (2) a disturbed zone; (3) a tense zone; and (4) a controlled zone. The so-called safe zone refers to places that are not directly involved in the disputes between the Soviet world and the Western world due to geographical circumstances. For example, after Australia's invading country, Japan, was defeated, it could relatively live in peace with the world and have its own world. The southern half of Africa and South America can also be classified into this category.</p>
<p>The disturbed zone refers to places that have special problems and cannot be stable. These problems are not unrelated to the world powers. The Soviet Union believes that these places are fertile ground for spreading communist seeds, and the Western countries believe that their preferential status there may be threatened. These places are always in danger of becoming tense areas, but they have not yet developed to this extent. India, Southeast Asia, and the Dutch East Indies can all be classified into this category.</p>
<p>The tense zone is where the policies and interests of the Soviet world and the Western world collide most directly, and there are the most disputes. The Middle East, Central Europe (including the free port areas), and other places belong to this category.</p>
<p>The controlled zone is the Soviet world and the Western world itself. Generally speaking, the Western world includes North America, northern South America, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe; the Soviet world starts from the Bering Sea in the east and extends to the Elbe River and the Adriatic Sea in the west.</p>
<p>Among these four types of regions, the safe zone and the disturbed zone are relatively secondary, and we might as well focus our attention on the controlled zone and the tense zone.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Has Extremely Complete Territory</p>
<p>The Soviet world occupies one-fifth of the total land area, and the completeness of this land is unparalleled in the world. It may become the most self-sufficient part of the earth and is always led by a centralized power. From a defensive point of view, this part of the land occupies the strongest position; from an offensive point of view, the land and air forces occupy a great advantage. However, in terms of the navy, it has not been fully utilized due to geographical limitations.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union is still an undeveloped country, but it has the largest population among white countries, has the largest army in the world, has abundant resources, and its production is increasing day by day. The national character is tough and enduring, strictly controlled, has an expansive momentum in politics and ideology, and is confident that it will be able to manufacture atomic bombs in the near future.</p>
<p>The Western World Has Quite a Few Advantages</p>
<p>In terms of area, the Western world is equivalent to the Soviet world, but it is very different in terms of military factors. Geographically, it is separated by the Atlantic Ocean, while the Soviet world is a whole unit. The Western world's leadership is in the hands of the United Kingdom and the United States, and sometimes it is held separately by the United Kingdom and the United States. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States and between the United Kingdom and the United States and other Western countries is neither certain nor solid. From a military point of view, the shortcomings of the Western world compared with the Soviet world are that the organization is not sound enough and the command is not unified enough. In addition, the military position of Western countries is not as good as that of the Soviet world, because Western Europe and the United Kingdom are very vulnerable to attack and are not easy to defend. In addition to these two factors, the Western world almost surpasses the Soviet world in any aspect of military strategy. Moreover, the power of the atomic bomb is also a major military advantage currently held by the Western world.</p>
<p>The year is coming to an end. At the end of 1946, the world situation seems to be like this. As for whether the entanglements can be eliminated and whether the deadlock can be broken, it depends on the wisdom of the entire human race and to what extent it has evolved.

<h3>General de Gaulle Declares Yesterday That He Does Not Intend to Participate in the Presidential Election; Speakers and Deputy Speakers of the French Senate Have Been Elected</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] General de Gaulle replied to a reporter's question at a press conference today: I am opposed to the current party politics, so I do not intend to participate in the presidential competition of the Fourth French Republic. The current party dictatorship cannot solve the serious domestic and foreign problems. I have already stated this point. The current constitution is to protect party power, so I dare not guarantee it. A president without real power cannot do anything. I believe that only those who think of the common good can save the French Republic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] General de Gaulle will soon make an important broadcast speech to the French people. Well-informed sources are unwilling to reveal the content of his speech, but they believe that he will mention his refusal to serve as president and the situation in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] After the Senate of the Fourth French Republic elected Mr. Le Ribeyre, a member of the People's Republican Party, as Speaker today, it immediately elected the Deputy Speakers, Treasurer, and Secretaries. Social Party member Mr. Pierre Brossolette, Mr. Monnerville of the Left-wing Republican Group, and Mr. Maurice Thorez, all three were elected as Deputy Speakers.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Food from Air</h3>
<p>Another New Idea from American Scientists</p>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 27th] Kettering, chief scientist of General Motors, announced at the Scientific Progress Association today that the world in the future may be able to use radiation chemistry to solve famine. Radiation chemistry is the use of nature to extract food that can be produced in the soil from carbon oxides, moisture in the air, and a few minerals. Currently, we do not know the method of extraction, but one day in the future, it may be made in the laboratory. Radiation chemistry can use a test tube, a gas lamp, or a measuring cup to make tens of billions of tons of carbon.</p>
<h3>Blum to Visit England to Discuss the German Issue</h3>
<p>British Control of the Ruhr Industrial Zone</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The London Evening News on the 27th reported that French Prime Minister Blum intends to visit London recently to hold important talks with Attlee and Bevin on the German issue.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] French Prime Minister Blum met with the U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Caffery, today for discussions, and afterwards also met with General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French occupation forces in Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the British government will soon publish a memorandum on its views on the future of Germany. As soon as the four foreign ministers meet in London next January to discuss the German issue, the British government will send this memorandum to the four foreign ministers and propose that the industry in the Ruhr and Rhineland areas be placed under international joint control, so that Germany can restore economic unity.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Troops Moved to the Greek Border; Greek Authorities Say the Situation in Northern Greece Has Improved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 27th] According to reliable sources, Yugoslavia is currently moving all its troops stationed on the Hungarian border to the Greek border. Yugoslavia's actions are due to the United Nations Security Council's decision to send a fact-finding committee to northern Greece. According to a senior Greek government official, the purpose of Yugoslavia's troop movements is to avoid accidents during the investigation by the fact-finding committee. In addition, according to Mr. Rodopoulos, the chief administrator of northern Greece, the situation in northern Greece has improved since July. Currently, the bandits operating in northern Greece can be divided into three categories: (1) those whose leaders have adopted policies that oppose Greek ideals; (2) professional bandits who are filled with the spirit of robbery and crime; and (3) elements recruited from the people, who do not have any ideals, but only have a spirit of adventure and hatred for Greece. The first and second types of bandits have suffered heavy losses, and there are many who are surrendering. The third type of bandit is deeply afraid of having too many people, so they have stopped recruiting. The bodies of the fallen bandits are always carried back by other bandits, because they are afraid that if the family members of the dead find out, it will hinder the recruitment. As for the Greek government troops and the gendarmerie, they have good discipline, and the people from the villages who fled to other places have gradually returned to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>The State of East Indonesia Will Form a Coalition Cabinet, Recruiting Overseas Chinese to Participate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 28th] The newly elected President of the State of East Indonesia, Mr. Sukawati, declared at a press conference today that the new cabinet of the State of East Indonesia will recruit representatives from the Chinese, Dutch, and Indonesian sides to participate. The policy will first promote the cooperation of people from all levels, but this matter must be realized after quelling the transgressions caused by unstable elements. Sukawati went on to believe that Dutch New Guinea will be incorporated into the Indonesian Federation in the future, and will not become a piece of land in the State of East Indonesia.</p>
<h3>Four-Nation Investigation Team Can Enter the Soviet Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>The Soviet Side Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] The Soviet side announced today that it is prepared to allow a four-nation investigation team to enter the Soviet occupation zone of Germany on January 6 next year to investigate the progress of clearing German military forces. This move proves that the demobilization of the Soviet occupying forces is nearing completion. According to the original plan, the four-nation investigation team was scheduled to enter the four occupation zones on November 25, but the Soviet Union requested a postponement, saying that the inspection of the Soviet military zone was difficult and there was still inconvenience. Later, there were repeated reports of a large-scale withdrawal of the Soviet occupying forces in Germany, but there were no official figures.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Money Worth 300 Million Francs Discovered on the French Market</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Two French counterfeit money masters have mixed 300 million francs of 100-franc denomination banknotes into the market. The two men have been sentenced to imprisonment, but they refused to tell the police the location and method of their counterfeiting. Counterfeit money worth 5 million francs has been confiscated, but the printing is very sophisticated and it is difficult to distinguish between true and false.</p>
<h3>Field Marshal Montgomery Will Visit Moscow; Stalin Has Invited Him Twice</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The British War Office announced: British Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery hopes to visit Moscow early next year, and he is very willing to learn about the military life of the Red Army. Marshal Stalin invited Marshal Montgomery to visit the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. On October 14, the Soviet military attaché in the United Kingdom sent Marshal Montgomery an invitation from Marshal Vasilyevsky, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, inviting him to Moscow at the end of 1946 or the beginning of 1947. Marshal Montgomery has expressed his acceptance.</p>

<h3>The Public Prosecutor's Office Begins to Investigate the Responsibility for the Major Plane Crash; Three Public Prosecutors, Including Cao Hong, are Responsible for the Investigation; On-Site Inspections Will Be Conducted Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Public Prosecutor's Office has been paying close attention to the major plane crash on Christmas Day, which killed or injured more than 80 passengers, and has been waiting for reports from all parties. However, as of yesterday, it had not received any reports from the airline or the police station at the scene of the accident. The Public Prosecutor's Office believes that the airline should bear legal responsibility for causing death due to negligence in its business operations. The chief prosecutor of the office, Huang Liang, specially instructed three public prosecutors, Cao Hong, Ji Su, and Wu Qihua, yesterday morning to be responsible for the investigation and prepare to initiate prosecution on their own initiative. After receiving the order, the three public prosecutors immediately assigned bailiffs to investigate the names, ages, birthplaces, and families of the victims at the scene of the accident and the locations of death, such as the Zhongshan Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Sino-American Hospital, and funeral homes. At the same time, they inquired with the two police stations about the reasons for not immediately reporting to the court. According to Article 160 of the Criminal Procedure Law: "In the event of a death that is not due to illness or is suspected of not being due to illness, the competent public prosecutor shall quickly conduct an autopsy. If there is suspicion of a crime, he shall continue to conduct necessary inspections." Therefore, the public prosecutor has the right to order that the bodies of the deceased passengers be prevented from being collected. However, the Public Prosecutor's Office has great sympathy for the families of the deceased passengers and will not do so. The public prosecutor also heard rumors that after the accident that night, the rescue personnel at the scene first engaged in looting the personal belongings of the dead and injured passengers, delaying the rescue mission. It is extremely sinful to carry out robbery in the face of a catastrophe, and this will also be strictly investigated. At the same time, why the blind landing equipment at Jiangwan Airport could not be used temporarily, whether the night navigation equipment at the two airports was complete, and why the plane knew that the Shanghai climate was bad, but still had to land in Shanghai, etc., will all be the goals of the three public prosecutors' investigation. According to the three public prosecutors in charge, in order to fully exert the duties of a sound inspection system in a country ruled by law, the legal responsibilities for this tragedy will be pursued based on the spirit of judicial independence and a solemn position. Once the preliminary investigation is completed, the three public prosecutors will head to various places tomorrow to conduct on-site inspections in person.</p>

Many people at the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury and its readers feel the need to return home (Shanghai) and will do their best in the work of reconstruction and news reporting in Shanghai." The American edition of the newspaper was originally a product of wartime, published for people originally residing in the Far East. Because the newspaper could not be published in Shanghai during the occupation, the American edition was published to meet the public's expectations. At its peak, the newspaper had over 10,000 subscribers. Many China experts in the United States deeply regret the cessation of the newspaper's publication. According to Mr. Gould, the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury will still maintain an office in New York to report various news to China experts.</p>
<h3>Mayor Hosts Senators to Exchange Opinions on City Budget, Majority Consider the Numbers Too Large to Accept</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu hosted the speaker, vice speaker, and committee chairmen of the Municipal Senate at the Police Club at 7pm last night in an effort to discuss the municipal budget before the second assembly of the city senate convenes. A total of 70 people attended.</p>
<p>The mayor spoke first on the compilation of the budget and personnel restructuring policy, stating that the government has cut 900 personnel in succession to minimize administrative costs, but hired 1300, including teachers, tax collectors, and civil affairs staff. He acknowledged that the 230 billion yuan municipal budget might seem high, but compared it with the pre-war budget of 40 million yuan, asserting it isn't excessive relative to the current currency value. He stated that the budget was carefully considered and hoped that the senators can audit it, understand the difficulties, and pass it.</p>
<p>Following the mayor, the budget manager explained how the budget was composed. Director Gu of the Finance Bureau added that complaints on current tax collections were primarily targeted at municipal construction tax, the additional city tax. After repeated deliberation and consultation with citizens and senators, the municipal government determined to not double the tax during the winter, and reduce it by one third. These deductions apply to households that pay less than 100 yuan annually for rent, which will include 12000 households, and reduced tax will be applied to renters following a progressive rate. Those renting from 500, 1000, or 2000 annual yuan will be assessed between 50-80% of the original amount. Director Gu expressed his gratitude towards the senators for undergoing criticism from citizens over these tax matters.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan thanked the mayor, stating the excessive tax rate in the city has made life difficult for the senators and the city residents, but the city government is still in need of these funds to run the government, leaving the senators in a difficult position to approve this budget. He stated that on his way back to Shanghai from Nanjing, the criticisms from residents at the train station had alarmed him and made him anxious. He acknowledged the difficulties the city government is facing, and stated that senators should consider the well being of the residents as well as the operational needs of the city government.</p>
<p>The senators expressed that the size of the budget was difficult to accept, and requested that the city government reduce administrative headcount and reallocate these funds towards construction projects.</p>
<p>Finally, the mayor stated that he would accept the opinions of the senators and do his best. He also mentioned that he had originally planned to invite all senators to the reception, but had to limit it to only group leaders to save on costs.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Xiong Jiandong Received Foreign Medals, Wang Didi Met Relatives in Shanghai, Unclaimed Large and Small Corpses Finally Identified as His Father and Sister</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] While many people in the world were celebrating Christmas night, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Flight 115 crashed in the rain and fog near the Third Bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, in a pond to the right of Hetamiao. Of the forty-one people on board, thirty-four died and six were injured. Only the four-year-old "lucky boy" Wang Didi was unharmed. Don't you think this is a miracle? Look at the photo, what an adorable child!</p>
<p>In the past few days, because no family members had come to claim him, the CNAC temporarily fostered him at Zhongshan Hospital. At 2:45 p.m. yesterday, his maternal aunt, Ms. Tang Yijun, took him home.</p>
<p>Ms. Tang is Mrs. Xiong Jiandong, who is also Wang Didi's only relative in Shanghai. She saw the news in the newspaper, and the company also notified her, so she rushed to Zhongshan Hospital yesterday morning to visit her lucky nephew. Ms. Tang took out a photo of her younger brother and his wife and nephew to show Wang Didi, asking him, "Who are these people?" The intelligent Wang Didi replied one by one, "Uncle, Mommy, and cousin." They all lived together in Chongqing, so Wang Didi knew them all. However, he felt very unfamiliar with the aunt who came to take him home to raise him.</p>
<p>Ms. Tang Yizhang, Tang Yijun's younger sister, was from Guangxi, and her husband, Wang Genfa, was from Suzhou. They brought Wang Didi and Wang Didi's younger sister, a total of four people, from Chongqing to Shanghai. Now that the plane has crashed, Wang Didi is the only one left alive. Ms. Tang told reporters that she had never met Wang Genfa, so she only recognized the body of Wang Didi's mother, Tang Yizhang, at the funeral home. As for who his father and sister were, she had to take Wang Didi to identify them himself. However, because Wang Didi was not feeling well later, they did not go. There were only two unclaimed bodies, one large and one small, at the China Funeral Home. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were Wang Didi's father, Wang Genfa, and Wang Didi's younger sister, so they were both placed in coffins yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>For the sake of caution, the CNAC asked Ms. Tang Yijun to write a guarantee and complete all the procedures. The four-year-old Wang Didi got into the No. 16334 car with his unfamiliar aunt and left Zhongshan Hospital to live with his aunt on Yuyuan Road. There, he will have many cousins to accompany him and will no longer feel lonely!</p>
<p>At the hospital, a nurse asked the four-year-old child, "What is your father's name?" He replied, "Wang Dad." "Where is Dad?" "In Chongqing." "What about Mommy?" He pouted and shook his head, without answering. This poor child does not know that he has lost his father, his mother, and his sister forever. He does not know that he has experienced a great disaster, nor does he know that he is the only lucky one. He is only four years old. May he grow up happily and no longer have these bloody stories in his mind! Many people are saying, "A narrow escape from death is sure to bring future blessings." May God bless this "little angel" who encountered disaster and was rescued on Christmas night and make him happy forever!</p>

<h3>Senate Suggests Improving the Economy, Executive Yuan Replies with Six Points of Explanation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Senate previously decided at the first conference to send a delegation of eleven people, including Deputy Speaker Xu, to Nanjing to petition for improved economic policies. The Executive Yuan has now replied by telegram, stating:</p>
<p>Assisting Production Has Been Considered</p>
<p>"The telegram and attachments have been received. The original suggestions regarding various financial and economic measures, including 1. Adjusting banking operations, 2. Adjusting agricultural, industrial, and commercial funds, 3. Developing international trade, and 4. Invigorating local land finance, have been directly reviewed and replied to by the Ministry of Finance. Recently, in order to assist the development of production industries, resolve the economic crisis, and promote economic recovery, the Executive Yuan specially convened a meeting of financial and industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai to discuss the direction. Matters related to production loan interest rates and procedures, as well as the supply of machinery, raw materials, and other items needed for normal production industries, have all been considered.</p>
<p>Factory Losses Summarized for Claims</p>
<p>5. Compensation for war losses: The losses suffered by factories during the war should be reported to the Compensation Committee in accordance with regulations, and compensation will be claimed from Japan in the future. Priority purchase of enemy and puppet factories by rear-area restored factories has been established and announced for implementation. If rear-area restored factories have needs, they can apply to the competent authorities in accordance with regulations. In addition, the income from the disposal of enemy and puppet materials and property should be fully handed over to the national treasury in accordance with regulations. If local governments hold education, culture, charity, and economic construction projects, they should apply for the use of enemy and puppet properties within their jurisdiction in accordance with the "Measures for Local Governments to Allocate and Receive Enemy and Puppet Properties."</p>
<p>Fuel Control a Measure of Expediency</p>
<p>6. Abolishing coal rationing: At the beginning of recovery, most of the major mining areas were destroyed, and coal reserves were extremely low, with insufficient production. The government adopted rationing measures to support production and assist in solving the difficulties of public utilities, railways, ships, and various industrial coal uses in the Southeast provinces. However, white coal briquettes and coke used for cooking and heating by urban residents are not subject to rationing, and merchants can sell them freely. This rationing measure is a temporary expedient. Once production and transportation conditions improve, the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee will be dismantled. Let it be known."</p>
<h3>Second Assembly: Registration Begins</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Senate's second assembly began yesterday with the registration of fifty-four senators. In order to make the proceedings of the meeting as clear as possible to the public, if citizens request to attend, they must be introduced by a senator or approved by the council.

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry's Year-End Bonus Issue: Difference Between Seven Days and One Month; Society Hopes Labor Will Make Concessions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, issued a statement on the year-end bonus issue in the silk weaving industry, saying, "More than 15% of the silk weaving industry is in a very precarious situation. Those who are barely maintaining are hoping to overcome the current difficulties by means of production loans. After the labor side made its demand for a year-end bonus, the Bureau of Social Affairs mediated three times. Currently, the capital side has agreed to seven days, while the labor side insists that it must be one month. However, a seven-day year-end bonus would require the silk weaving industry to pay out 1.4 billion yuan, and a one-month demand is in fact impossible to bear. I deeply hope that the labor side can realize the folly of 'killing the chicken to get the egg' and accept the seven-day number. Otherwise, the Bureau of Social Affairs will make a ruling when necessary."</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital Dispute in the Hospitality Industry: Judgment Committee Has Ruled</h3>
<p>Director Wu also announced that the labor-capital dispute in the hotel industry has been ruled by the Labor-Capital Dispute Judgment Committee as follows: (1) Salary part: Adopt the "base salary discount system." Eighty percent of the worker's salary is for the employee's livelihood guarantee and must be paid monthly regardless of business conditions. The remaining 40% is used to calculate employee salaries based on the hotel's business performance. (2) Severance pay: Refer to the Judgment Committee's method for factories to dismiss workers, and determine the amount of severance pay based on the length of service, with a maximum of no more than three months. (3) Guarantee money refund issue: According to Article 6 of the record of inquiry made by the Police Bureau on January 24 of this year, when a worker is dismissed, the guarantee money will be refunded in its original total amount, and a bonus of one to two months will be issued. Another dispatch: The Bureau of Social Affairs currently stipulates that if either party's representative fails to attend three times after the bureau convenes mediation for a labor-capital dispute, a ruling will be made in absentia. However, this does not apply to cases where the summons cannot be delivered.</p>
<h3>Hualian Ship Sets Sail Today: Carrying Jewish Emigrants Back to Australia</h3>

<h3>Two Cases of Men and Women Taking Poison</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:00 p.m. last night, Yan Aifeng, a 25-year-old young woman, took poison in Room 7, Rongxiang Lane, Yanjia Pavilion, Xibaoxing Road. Fortunately, she was discovered and taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the reason for the suicide was that her husband's speculation failed, and a quarrel broke out between the couple. In addition, a man named Huang Guimin at No. 278, Beisichuan Road also committed suicide by swallowing gold due to economic pressure.</p>
<h3>East Asia One Floor Resumes Business: Labor-Capital Dispute Being Mediated</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor-capital dispute at Dongya Yilou (East Asia One Floor) in the Zhabei district, which started some time ago, has been resolved under the mediation of the Bureau of Social Affairs, with incremental progress being made.

The labor representatives also reported the reasons for the shutdown and the process to the press yesterday. Currently, the employees have put forward four demands: (1) Resume work as soon as possible; (2) Pay the salaries and bonuses for November and December and all public accumulation funds; (3) Open the main door of the restaurant; (4) Provide food and wages before resuming work. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has promised to convene both parties for consultation again tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Tax Reform Better Than Tax Increase: Senators' Opinions on the Municipal Budget; Believe the City is No Longer Obligated to Provide Labor Services</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's budget for the 36th year of the Republic, as a result of the review and compilation by various bureaus and departments, has reached more than 230 billion yuan in expenditures. In order to balance revenue and expenditure shortfalls, the Municipal Government has included the municipal construction surcharge on house rent tax and the municipal surcharge on public utility fees into the temporary revenue item in accordance with the autumn tax rate of the 35th year. In addition, a new obligation labor substitute fee of 40 billion yuan has been added under the revenue item, totaling more than 86.8 billion yuan. The budget has already been sent to the Senate. This reporter specially interviewed various senators to solicit their opinions on this budget. The senators almost unanimously expressed that they dare not simply ask about setting up temporary revenue to make up for the insufficient tax revenue. During the first assembly of this Senate, it was agreed that the temporary increase in municipal construction fees and public utility fees would be limited to this year, and they did not approve the extension to the next year's budget. Moreover, the obligation labor substitute fee has been added to the new budget for next year, which is even more inappropriate. Furthermore, the Constitution recently passed by the National Assembly stipulates that the people have the obligation to perform military service, but not the obligation to perform labor service, so this tax cannot be established. They also said that tax reform is better than tax increase. They hope that the Municipal Government will reduce new taxes and strive to reorganize the original tax revenue to increase the tax amount. From this point of view, this issue will become a major issue for heated discussion at the second assembly of the Senate.</p>
<h3>Motorcycle Patrol Encountered an Ambush at Night: Both Sides Opened Fire on Lincoln Road; A Large Group of Police Officers Encircled and Searched</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the jurisdiction of the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau in the western suburbs of Shanghai, bandits often appear at night. The Municipal Police Bureau specially instructed the sub-bureau chief, Zhang Zhen, to send more patrols to work day and night, and to rotate the motorcycle patrols. At about 8:00 p.m. last night, a motorcycle patrol team of more than ten people patrolled to a place about 100 yards west of the Lincoln Road Watchtower of the Zhoujiaqiao Outpost of the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau. More than ten bandits ambushed in the ditches on both sides, drew their guns, and fired seven or eight shots. At that time, the motorcycle patrol police officers quickly dismounted and returned fire, firing more than ten shots. Bullets flew everywhere. Two horses were shot and injured, and police officer Si Zhengxiao (24 years old, from Zhuji), No. 5588, and police officer Jiang Qi (24 years old, from Anhui), No. 4621, were injured in the fall and were later sent to the police hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the bandits even dared to enter the Xinsheng Ranch at No. 250 on the same road, intending to rob it. Fortunately, the ranch called the watchtower to report it. Patrol Leader Li led a number of police officers to rush there and reported to the Shangxinjing Sub-bureau and the General Bureau. Before long, the Criminal Police Department of the General Bureau ordered all police officers on duty to take several police vehicles, and the motorcycle team, the Deputy Team Leader of the Justice Police Criminal Police Brigade, Zheng Youchen, led the team leader Zhang Tianan and six team members. The Shangxinjing Sub-bureau and the Changning Police Bureau also dispatched a large number of police officers. The chief of the Criminal Department, Zhang Shi, and the sub-bureau chief, Hong Zhen, arrived one after another and guarded the key points. Police officers stood guard every three steps and patrolled every five steps. From the south of Lincoln Road to the north of Hongqiao Road, west of Zhongshan Road to the east of Gubei Road, a tight encirclement of about three miles was made. Another group of police officers was dispatched to search house by house in each village to prevent the bandits from escaping. As of 1:30 a.m. this morning, the search was still in progress. According to Sub-bureau Chief Zhang, the bandits were led by one with a pockmarked face and one with a hunchback, with more than twenty followers, equipped with long and short military weapons, harassing Hongqiao, Shangxinjing, and other places for half a month, which is very hateful, so they must be wiped out.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Exhibition Market: Shops Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>The Domestic Goods Exhibition Market temporarily closed yesterday because the Xincheng Police Bureau sent personnel to the Shanghai Velvet Company at the market to seize goods, causing a misunderstanding among all participating manufacturers. After the two sides explained, except for the part of the Shanghai Machine Line Company that was waiting for legal processing, the manufacturers immediately resumed business as usual.</p>
<h3>Vehicle River Crossing: Planning a Ferry Service to Facilitate Cargo Transport in Pudong; Pier Locations Have Been Selected</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Ferry Company, recognizing that the material collection points in the city are concentrated, and the cargo depots in Puxi are no longer sufficient to accommodate them, while the cargo depots in Pudong are underutilized due to transportation issues, is preparing a vehicle ferry service to cross the Huangpu River. It is reported that locations have been selected on both sides of the river, with the Puxi side being the Lujiabang Branch Road and the Pudong side being the Liangmatou Road.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Binhou, an engineer from the company, who spoke to our reporter, the selected locations are not the most ideal, but rather the ones where land issues on both sides are the simplest and easiest to resolve. The shoreline of the piers on both sides is approximately 80 meters long, and the piers and ships will be parallel to the shoreline. Vehicles will cross via fixed approach bridges and movable drawbridges, disembarking from the bow or stern of the ship. This top-level ferry station design has been finalized after research by engineering experts, based on the principles of economy, convenience, and safety.</p>
<p>Regarding land transportation on both sides, Puxi does not pose a problem. However, Pudong can only勉强通達大道, so the company hopes that the municipal authorities can construct a new road in the future.</p>
<p>As for the transport vessels, the company plans to request the purchase of two landing crafts from the Bureau of Materials Supply. Each vessel can carry approximately ten vehicles at a time, with a daily capacity of 700 to 800 vehicles. It is expected to be completed by March or April of next year.</p>
<p>In addition to this line, the company also plans to open a second ferry line in the Hongkou area, with the Puxi location being Guanzhou Road and the Pudong location being Xidu.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai Ferry Company will build a modern passenger ferry station south of the Waterfront Hotel on Zhongshan East Road. It will have two levels with facilities such as telegraph, telephone, postal services, travel agencies, and restaurants. A similar ferry station is also planned for Luqiuqu Road in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Factories Jointly Request the Prevention of Work Slowdowns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of the employers of more than 20 cigarette factories in the city went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday at 6 p.m. to petition for the prevention of work slowdowns by workers. According to one representative who spoke to our reporter, the year-end bonus in the cigarette industry, as approved by the Bureau, is one month's salary for long-term workers and 8% of the total annual income for piece-rate and temporary workers. However, the workers' demands range from two to three months to four to five months, with no standard. Because the factories are unwilling to accept this, they have been slowing down their work, with daily production only about one-tenth of the usual, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, they have collectively petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to take effective measures to prevent this. In addition, the issue of year-end bonuses must be resolved by all factories together; individual compromises are not a good solution.</p>

<h3>Enemy Military Police Officer Mimura Haruki Sought Promotion Through False Accusations, Resulting in a Major Injustice; Entire Case Details Now Clear; Verdict Expected Tomorrow; Military Tribunal Reopened Trial Yesterday; Victims' Families Recount Experiences; "The Wolf of Changshu" Cannot Escape Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] "The Wolf of Changshu," enemy military police officer Mimura Haruki, was tried by Judge Lu Qi of the First Pacification District Military Tribunal yesterday morning, ending after 1 p.m. The case is now nearing its conclusion, with a joint session scheduled for tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m. to review the case before a verdict can be reached. The event will be filmed by the Central Film Studio.</p>
<p>Mimura Haruki was the captain of the enemy military police unit in Changshu, and his misdeeds were notorious throughout the countryside during his tenure. In 1943, Mimura, seeking promotion and reward, instigated a major injustice, indiscriminately arresting over 6,000 local residents in the Changshu and Taicang areas. Some were later released, but the fate of over 3,000 remains unknown. After the victory, Mimura was arrested by the authorities and subjected to repeated trials by the military tribunal. The accused made cunning excuses and attempted to shift blame, claiming that 27 of the detainees were sent to the Shanghai Military Law Conference and five others were sent to the local county hospital. To verify these claims, the military tribunal dispatched investigators to Changshu to gather detailed information and exhume the remains of the victims, confirming that Mimura's statements were entirely false. Therefore, the court reopened the trial yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ruddy Complexion, Natural Demeanor</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mimura wore a草綠military uniform and a草綠overcoat, appearing quite proper. He carried a military water bottle and had a ruddy complexion and natural demeanor. It was hard to believe he was a prisoner awaiting execution, and one might even suspect that his prison life was still quite comfortable. His face showed no signs of savagery, but he appeared extremely cunning. Judge Lu first summoned the victims' families, Lu Dashou, Wang Xuejun, Chen Jinhua, Huang Jue, and Zheng Peiyun's wife, from Yu Tai in Shanghai to testify. After a brief questioning, he sternly questioned Mimura based on the statements made by a doctor, nurse, administrator, and a former translator surnamed Lu who had worked at the county hospital in Changshu. The key points can be summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>Questioning Atrocities, Summarized in Four Points</h3>
<p>(1) Mimura denied ever committing atrocities. However, individuals who worked at the former county hospital testified that patients sent to the hospital by the military police were generally injured and had difficulty walking.</p>
<p>(2) Mimura claimed that Ye Zhenfei and four others died after being sent to the hospital due to illness and that their bodies were claimed by their families. However, in reality, whether patients sent to the hospital by the military police died or recovered, they were either buried or retrieved by the military police.</p>
<p>(3) The reason Mimura instigated the major injustice was to seek promotion and reward. Therefore, he first demolished the Yang family's house next to the military police station and built four prison cells. The person who suggested this was a translator surnamed Wang. After the victory, the translator, knowing his crimes were heinous, pleaded with Mimura, who provided him with money and a car to escape.</p>
<p>(4) Chen Yunzhou, the administrator of the county hospital, testified that after the large-scale arrests, many injured patients were sent to the hospital. Those who died were secretly transported by the enemy military police to be buried outside the North Gate at midnight, and onlookers were prohibited. He also witnessed two people surnamed Gu and Sang die from their injuries.</p>
<h3>Four Skeletons Brought to Court</h3>
<p>Mimura continued to be evasive about the above points, either denying them or claiming that they were the actions of his subordinates. However, Judge Lu calmly stated the facts, leaving the accused with no room for further evasion.</p>
<p>Four skeletons of victims, exhumed from Changshu and brought back by Li Yechu, the former chief clerk of the tribunal, were placed in the corner of the courtroom but were not shown to Mimura.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mimura's case will be judged on charges of murder under military law and abuse of power, and he will likely not escape death.</p>

<h3>Indictment After Completion of Investigation on Two Criminals, Kurozawa Tsuguo and Others</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The First Pacification District Military Tribunal has completed its investigation of Japanese war criminals Kurozawa Tsuguo and Kawazoe Nagatsugu and has initiated a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Kurozawa Tsuguo was a graduate of the Faculty of Law at Waseda University in Tokyo. He was the leader of the Pacification Work Team of the Japanese 22nd Division. The Pacification Office was responsible for intelligence work and was organized by Kurozawa Tsuguo starting in August 1940. It was established on November 3 of the same year and was stationed in the suburbs of Hangzhou, possessing over 500 rifles and machine guns. The team began killing five people in the month after its establishment, and then killed people one or two times a month, totaling more than 120 people, including local residents, our 保長, returning soldiers, and military and political personnel. Some were even buried alive, and Kurozawa personally shot more than ten people with a machine gun. Su Ronghe, the former acting magistrate of Hangzhou, was also arrested by them in July 1941 and taken to Genshan Gate, but was later released. However, he witnessed dozens of our captured soldiers at the scene, and Kurozawa's troops had shovels and other burial tools. After the victory, the criminal hid in the Hangzhou Japanese Resident Management Office and was arrested by the Zhejiang Higher Court Procuratorate and sent to the military tribunal.</p>
<p>Kawazoe Nagatsugu was the captain of the Shanghai West Military Police Unit. On May 1, 1945, he lured and arrested Chen Fengxiang, the intelligence leader of the 33rd Branch of our city party headquarters, and used sticks, water torture, kneeling on iron cans, and other forms of torture to force a confession, causing Chen's leg to be injured and never fully healed. On May 6 of the same year, he arrested a civilian, Xin Zhihong, and falsely accused him of being the author of anti-Japanese plays. He subjected him to water torture, and because Xin resisted by holding his breath, the criminal placed burning cigarettes on Xin's abdomen to prevent him from holding his breath, resulting in numerous scars. After the victory, he hid in a concentration camp and was identified by members of the 蒙難同志會.</p>

<h3>Auhad Bureau Espionage Case; Niemann-Hasser Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Niemann, an assistant to the Guangzhou branch of the Auhad Bureau, testified in US military court yesterday that he continued to work after Germany's surrender until August 11, 1945, when he learned that Japan had accepted the Potsdam Declaration. However, at that time, the Japanese side still intended to have them continue working, so two "seam telegraphers" continued to work for two more weeks. When Germany surrendered, his superior, Hasser, instructed him not to resign and paid him twice.</p>
<p>Hasser, formerly in charge of the Chongqing branch of the Guangzhou branch, also testified in court yesterday. He deflected responsibility, claiming that the Auhad Bureau headquarters did not issue any orders to dissolve the Guangzhou branch when Germany surrendered. As for the funds remitted by headquarters, he believed they were used to pay staff salaries.</p>
<h3>Explosion at Welding Factory Injures Apprentice and Student</h3>

<h3>District Head Accused of Sealing Up School; Li Boqing Says He Knows Nothing; Complex Case; Defendant Remanded</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Boqing, the district head of the 16th District, and his wife, Gao Palian, are accused of using the names of organizations such as the "Youth Guidance Group" to print seals and dispatching Wang Ying, an officer of the district, to seal up Qinghua Primary School in Nanhua New Village within the jurisdiction of the 16th District, because the school's property belonged to Chen Qun's rebellious assets. This was discovered by Li Jiuyun, a commissioner of the Central Statistics Bureau, who secretly reported it to the Central Statistics Bureau. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Huang Guangjue of the District Court opened the trial. Gao Palian claimed that she only stamped the seals with the district office seal, and the sealing was carried out by a certain military agency. Li Boqing claimed that he knew nothing about this matter and that he was falsely accused because he had made enemies during his campaign for city councilor. Judge Huang considered the case to be complex and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

Last month, Wu was drafted into the army and requested a division of shares, but the attempt failed, resulting in a conflict. At 10 p.m. the night before last, Chen secretly hid a lamb-slaughtering knife and waited for Wu at his home. When Wu returned, Chen stepped forward and stabbed him violently in the abdomen, causing his stomach to rupture and his intestines to spill out. Wu fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Chen fled. His mother carried him to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Unified Calculation of Cotton Yarn Production Costs; Five Accounting Subjects Determined; Each Factory to Calculate Separately and Submit to the Textile Control Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At a recent meeting, the Textile Control Commission (紡管會) decided to set new prices for cotton yarn purchases based on current production costs. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from the accounting, finance, and statistics departments of various National and private yarn factories gathered in the conference room of the Textile Construction Company on Jiangxi Road to discuss the accounting subjects for calculating production costs. Vice Chairman Li and Director Liu Wenteng of the Textile Control Commission also attended. The meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM. It was decided to unify the accounting subjects for calculating the production costs of military cotton yarn into five major categories: 1. Raw materials, 2. Wages, 3. Manufacturing expenses, 4. Financial expenses, and 5. Business expenses. Manufacturing expenses are further divided into items such as materials, depreciation, employee benefits, power, and repairs. National and private yarn factories will separately calculate their respective production costs based on these unified items, to be submitted for approval at a meeting of the Textile Control Commission.</p>
<h3>Reproduction Industry Unanimously Hopes That Cotton Yarn Supply Will Be Regular</h3>
<p>The fourth round of the fourth batch of yarn allocation has been delayed for a week, still without definite news due to the need to renegotiate prices. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Reproduction Allocation Committee, a regular supply of cotton yarn is the sincere hope of all reproduction industries. However, occasional delays and price renegotiations are not considered serious problems. Regarding the new cotton yarn control measures recently decided by the Textile Control Commission, Mr. Yi (溢氏) stated that this is a universal issue concerning society and the people's livelihood, and not merely a matter between the government and yarn factory owners. On the surface, the new measures seem to be a compromise between the two parties. Regarding the future supply of cotton yarn and the rise and fall of yarn prices, it is believed that the Textile Control Commission will give serious consideration to society and the people's livelihood. Mr. Pan also pointed out that since September, yarn control policies have been changed three times, and the new measures may still be experimental. Furthermore, the detailed procedures for how the Textile Control Commission will handle the cotton yarn purchased from yarn factories, and how yarn factory owners will supply the retained portion, still need to be discussed. In this regard, the reproduction industry wishes to reiterate its advocacy for a regular supply of cotton yarn. He revealed yesterday that the Reproduction Allocation Committee had previously submitted a written opinion to the Textile Control Commission, advocating that half of the yarn used by the reproduction industry should be allocated regularly on a fixed basis, and half should be allocated flexibly on a temporary basis, so that both supply and demand sides can operate in an orderly manner, to prevent monopolists from disrupting the market and speculators from running rampant. As for the possibility of exporting cotton yarn to earn foreign exchange, the Reproduction Allocation Committee advocates that the reproduction industry should be allowed to receive yarn for processing and export the finished products to Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to stabilize yesterday. Although customer demand has not improved, market sentiment has become firm. 20-count and 16-count yarns of various brands continued to rise by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan. 32-count fine yarn, due to limited arrivals from Qingdao and Tianjin, was eagerly sought by Cantonese merchants, and its price soared. For example, 32-count Five Color Star (五彩星) yarn jumped from 2.7 million yuan yesterday to 2.82 million yuan, with limited supply. 42-count yarn was also popular, following the trend with an increase of about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Dull</h3>
<p>The public bond market was dull yesterday, with mixed bonds slightly recovering. Unified Type C bonds remained stable, opening at 1,380 yuan in the morning. With purchases from Chengtong (誠德) and Room 503, the price rose to around 1,490 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A and B bonds fell by 50 yuan, and Unified Types D and E bonds fell by 20 yuan. Total trading volume was 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Cooperative Bank to Open on the Sixth of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Cooperative Bank is scheduled to open on the sixth of next month in Shanghai.

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Initially Weak, Then Firm</h3>
<p>The Taiwan sugar market initially weakened yesterday, then firmed. The association's clearing price for the spot market was 137,500 yuan for medium-grade white sugar and 127,000 yuan for raw red sugar in the morning. By the afternoon, the company's previous sugar payments were allowed to be flexible, so the trend turned positive. The clearing price for medium-grade white sugar rose to 145,000 yuan, and raw red sugar rose to 135,000 yuan, an increase of about 8,000 yuan. However, green sugar remained soft. Shantou green sugar opened at 110,000 yuan to 108,000 yuan, Runde green sugar was quoted at 108,000 yuan, and finally settled at 105,400 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

<h3>Export Control Commission Establishes Offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen</h3>
<p>To strengthen trade management at various ports, the Export Control Commission plans to establish offices in important commercial ports throughout the country. The commission has decided to establish offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen first. It is reported that the candidates for the heads of the offices have been determined. (One) Manager Mai Zuoheng will concurrently serve as the head of the Guangzhou office, and Xu Fengzao will be appointed as the head of the Xiamen office. They will be established separately within days.</p>
<h3>Defaults Affect Tea Market</h3>
<p>The foreign-owned tea market, which mainly sells Chenzhu tea to Africa, saw limited transactions at local tea companies due to scarce supply. The sales of other varieties, such as Chuzhen and Zhenmei, also proved difficult. The overall trend for other teas was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Amidst this sluggish tea market, some established businesses are suffering from the pressure of "high-interest loans," finding it difficult to bear. Not long ago, over forty tea firms in Hangzhou were attacked by this trend and went bankrupt. At the same time, it is reported that many firms in Suzhou and Tianjin also went bankrupt. Recently, it has been learned that this trend has gradually spread to this city. Several firms have already closed down in the past few days. If this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, the number of firms following suit may increase.</p>
<h3>Limited Transactions in Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Transactions in woolen fabrics were limited at tea parties and wholesale shops on Qipan Street yesterday. Due to the approaching end of the year, tight credit, and the prevalence of defaults, coupled with other environmental factors, all transactions required cash. At the same time, actual sales have reached their tail end, the public's purchasing power has sharply decreased, and the black market interest rates are getting higher and higher. Most stores with some financial strength are willing to temporarily suspend business for a few days and wait for the end of the year. Therefore, the prices of various goods are trending downward. Spring tweed is the most promising, while overcoat fabrics continue to decline. Melton fabrics, which had previously risen due to delays in licenses and customs procedures, saw a large number of arrivals yesterday, and the standard price has fallen from 42,000 yuan to 39,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Unstable; US Dollar Slightly Weaker</h3>
<p>Spot gold continued to weaken yesterday, and buyers remained unable to rally. The price trended downward towards the close. It opened at 3.28 million in the morning, and the situation was unstable after the opening. Demand and supply fluctuated, and operators widened the buying and selling prices. It rose and fell suddenly, first rising to 3.34 million, with slight pressure. Around 10:00 AM, it fell to 3.25 million, and the Central Bank allocated gold at this price to four-one bars. After the supply was slightly reduced, buying interest rose again, and the price rose as high as 3.44 million. After pressure from the Central Bank, it was still difficult to move forward. Therefore, retail buyers were forced to settle due to tight credit, and the price fell to around 3.3 million at noon. In the afternoon, it fell as low as 3.21 million, then stabilized slightly. Finally, it was between 3.28 million and 3.3 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Holiday gold was 350,000 yuan. Silver dollars rose again, and black market interest rates remained between 15% and 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were not active yesterday. The black market price of the US dollar initially rose to 6,600 yuan around 6,400 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, the gold market crashed, and the price was reported as low as 6,000 yuan to 6,200 yuan. Finally, it was sold at 6,300 yuan, a decrease of about 200 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was sluggish, and the result was similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,230 yuan for sale, but the transaction volume was still small. The Indian exchange rate was 1,500 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,800 yuan, but there were no buyers. The US exchange rate remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Banks Should Reduce Accepting Sealed Banknotes as Much as Possible; Customers Should Seal Banknotes; Responsible Persons of the Banking Association Issue Statements</h3>
<p>According to responsible persons of the Banking and Commercial Association, the Association recently, in view of the large number of banknotes being exchanged in the market, often with tens of millions of yuan being transferred in and out of a single account, found that it was impossible for both parties to check the numbers. Therefore, the sealing method was adopted. However, if these banknotes are sent to the Central Bank, the remitting bank must reseal them, and the remitting bank is responsible for any shortages in the future. In theory, the remitting bank can seek compensation from the previous party, and the responsibility seems clear and undeniable. However, recent facts have revealed many malpractices. First, due to the long period of accumulation, counting is difficult. Second, after repeated transfers, it is difficult to investigate who is ultimately responsible, and each party has its own version, making it impossible to judge. Therefore, disputes of this kind between customers and banks are endless. Cunning individuals even use various methods to take advantage of the situation, resulting in shortages of up to hundreds of thousands of yuan in sealed banknotes. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to mutual entanglement and an irreparable situation. The sealing method was originally a temporary expedient to cope with the squeeze. Now that malpractices have arisen, it is urgent to improve it. In terms of fundamental solutions, it is necessary to promote the circulation of negotiable instruments and reduce the exchange of currency. In terms of immediate solutions, each bank should first reduce accepting sealed banknotes from customers as much as possible. Except for those who are particularly trustworthy, counting must be done at any time, regardless of the difficulty of manpower and resources, and should not be delayed for too long, in order to clarify the responsibility of each party. At the same time, the Association has sent a letter to the Central Bank, requesting that it check the original sealed banknotes of each bank stored in the Bank as soon as possible, so as to avoid future difficulties in tracing and losses.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Market: Year-End Market Closure; Several Ups and Downs This Year; Considerable Profits at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Trading in the raw materials market has become sparse since yesterday. As the end of the year approaches, both buyers and sellers are busy with year-end settlements, so the market has suddenly become deserted. Transactions in trading houses and stores have also trended toward a closed state. Looking back on the raw materials business this year, the business of general trading houses was quite prosperous from January to April, and profits were quite considerable. Newly established trading houses sprang up like mushrooms after rain, mostly engaged in ordering goods. After May, orders poured in, and the raw materials trading houses trended downhill. At this time, raw material importers faced many difficulties, such as the uncertainty of when ordered goods would arrive, and the unbearable interest on loans. When the ordered goods arrived, they rushed to sell them, and the prices were lower than the ordered value abroad. In addition, manufacturers also directly ordered the goods that the trading houses had, so they could not sell them. Furthermore, due to traffic obstructions and industrial stagnation in other ports, raw materials were clogged in a corner of Shanghai, and prices depreciated again and again. Almost all of the century-old trading houses were on the verge of collapse, let alone the newly established trading houses. Only companies with strong financial strength let their goods pile up like mountains and waited quietly for the opportunity. However, most of those operating on loans had their funds frozen in foreign orders and could not turn them over. They had to sell all the popular goods at a discount to repay their debts. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the raw materials trading houses saw a turnaround again. At this time, most factories in the city increased production and resumed work, and orders had not arrived for a long time due to the US maritime workers' strike. Raw material prices slowly rose. By late November, industrial raw materials, regardless of popular or unpopular goods, were very profitable. The price of popular goods soared, and the value of unpopular goods also increased tenfold. Therefore, the raw materials business this year can safely pass the year-end, especially the profits earned in November and December, which were quite substantial.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Speculation Gradually Taking Effect; Authorities' Supervision Becoming More Active</h3>
<p>According to a financial authority interviewed by the reporter, the unstable situation caused by speculation in recent days has gradually passed after strict crackdown by the relevant authorities. The bill clearing situation yesterday was quite good. The clearing time was earlier than the previous two days, and there were not many returned bills. From this, it can be hoped that the end of the year can be safely passed. As for the gold shops engaged in speculation in the black market, in addition to Yongxing Gold Shop, which was sealed by the municipal government on the orders of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the management of the remaining gold shops is stricter than before, so that speculators cannot hide in them. In addition to strengthening management by the financial authorities in charge, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank is also exercising its strict supervisory responsibility. It is expected that the turmoil of speculation will soon be quelled.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit; High Black Market Interest Rates; Hua Shares' Swap Trading Active</h3>
<p>Hua shares were erratic yesterday. Trading in the market was purely dominated by swaps. Initially, the financial community did not make any moves, so the swap spread was very large. Yong Yarn reached over 35 yuan, Xinyi (信和) reached over 15 yuan, and the aggregate interest rate reached over 25%. Later, Xinhua and Ye (業) and others came to maintain the market, and the situation began to stabilize slightly. The morning opening was low. Numbers 224 and 229 bought spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 85, 91, and 198 bought forward delivery, gradually rising to over 625 yuan. Numbers 155, 89, and 61 sold spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 70, 4, and 229 sold forward Yong Yarn. Then, after 10:00 AM, the price fell to 604 yuan. Number 89 took advantage of the low price to cover, and numbers 180, 22, 185, 224, and 14 all bought. The gold market was bullish, forward Yong Yarn rose to 648 yuan, and spot Yong Yarn rose to over 611 yuan. Number 99 vigorously sold spot Yong Yarn, and numbers 218, 215, 185, 172, and 145 successively sold. The gold price also fell back. Near noon, spot Yong Yarn fell below 585 yuan, but because numbers 233 and 89 and others covered, it was still able to rebound at noon. The result was a slight increase for Jicheng Yarn (計丞紗) and Xinguang (新光) compared to the previous close. Xinyi, Jingfu, Qinxing (勤興), and Huafeng (華豐) fell slightly, and Meiya (美亞) fell by half. There were very few transactions in unpopular shares. Match, Lilian (麗安), Jinglun (景綸), and Underwear rose slightly, and the rest changed little. Forward delivery saw a slight increase for Xinyi and Xinguang. Xinyi and Meiya were flat, and Huafeng was slightly stronger. The various shares outside the market remained stable.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign shares were scarce. Only Yisha (怡紗) and British United saw relatively more trading. The gold market changed from strong to weak, and the various shares fell slightly. The result was a decrease of half for Yeguang (業廣) compared to the previous close. The rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Shipped to Hong Kong; For Exchange of Goods; Selling Price Not Much Different from Chinese Yarn; First Batch of 5,500 Bales</h3>
<p>[Our Report] There have been repeated rumors in the textile industry that Japanese yarn is being shipped to Hong Kong at depreciated prices for dumping. The reporter interviewed a major figure in the textile industry yesterday, who said: As far as he knows, the shipment of Japanese yarn to Hong Kong was contracted by the Hong Kong government with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan. The first batch is 5,500 bales, which will likely be shipped to Hong Kong for sale after one month. However, this batch of cotton yarn is the result of the Hong Kong government's exchange of goods with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan. The goods offered by Hong Kong for exchange are sugar and other materials. Therefore, the cost of the cotton yarn depends on the cost of the exchanged goods. However, after the war, the United Kingdom and the United States had a so-called world price for cotton yarn. The standard is 250 US dollars per 400-pound bale of 20-count cotton yarn. This is to prevent various countries from dumping cotton yarn in the world market at depreciated prices. Therefore, it is expected that the selling price of this batch of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong will not be below the world price. If calculated according to this ratio, the price difference between Japanese yarn and Chinese yarn will not be too great. Furthermore, the raw cotton used in Japanese yarn production after the war is all old cotton that has been obtained from the United States for many years. Therefore, the quality of the cotton yarn is not ideal. The Hong Kong government's purchase of this batch of Japanese yarn is intended to stabilize yarn prices in Hong Kong. All control measures will be quite strict. Therefore, even if the selling price of Japanese yarn in Hong Kong is slightly lower than that of Chinese yarn, the quantity that could be smuggled will be very small. Also, according to a cotton yarn authority, the shipment of Japanese yarn to Hong Kong will not begin until January next year. The first batch will be 55,000 bales, to be shipped within three months. It was previously reported that the price of each bale of Japanese yarn was only 800,000 legal currency, but according to the expert's estimate, it will be at least 1,500 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Tianjin Import and Export Industry in a State of Stagnation</h3>
<p>[United Press Tianjin, 27th] According to the North China Trading Company, one of the major commercial firms in Tianjin, Tianjin's import and export industry has been in a state of stagnation for the past month, partly due to changes in foreign trade regulations and partly due to the chaotic situation in North China. In accordance with the newly revised regulations, registration procedures for import treasures are still in progress, so the government authorities have not yet issued import licenses. Currently, the only goods allowed to be imported are artificial dyes, explosives, linen, woolen fabrics, printing materials, door-stay glasses, and rope oil, with a value of only about 2,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Chinese Bonds on the London Market Spark Speculative Interest</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 27th] The "Standard Evening Post" wrote that, according to stockbrokers, Chinese bonds, which are hovering around the lowest prices of the year, seem to have sparked the interest of speculators. Six pence ago, the optimism that people generally had about the prospects of Chinese bonds was shaken by the continuing unrest in China. Currently, the general impression is that speculators' desire for an immediate market recovery is not easy to achieve.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Overrun with Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Hong Kong has become a market for smuggled goods exported from our country. In addition to tin exported from Guangzhou in large quantities, it is now learned that water buffalo hides are being transported from Hankou to Hong Kong. The transportation is organized and contracted by groups such as the Yellow Ox Party, so operators only need to send people to Hong Kong to negotiate transportation and sales. It is said that after these materials are exported, most of them seek further commercial development in Hong Kong, so the funds are unlikely to return to this country in the short term.</p>
<h3>Market Full of Selling; Prices of Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Fall</h3>

<h3>Representatives of Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Paid Respects to Mayor Wu Yesterday Morning; Mayor Agreed to Advance Half a Month's Salary</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Association, due to the meager salaries and difficult living conditions of teachers and staff in municipal schools, requested the municipal government to adjust salaries during the ninth general meeting held on the 22nd of this month (Sunday), putting forward five demands, which have not yet been met. As the end of the year is approaching and living conditions are truly unsustainable, they unanimously decided to take a general leave of absence on January 6th. They specially appointed Xi Zhenyong, Li Xianzhang, Zhang Zhihua, Gu Risan, and Zhu Lie as representatives, who, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, paid respects to Mayor Wu again yesterday (the 28th) at 10:30 AM, insisting on the following three demands: (1) Please issue winter clothing allowances of 500,000 yuan per person as soon as possible.

<p>Winter Clothing Allowance Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the 500,000 yuan winter clothing allowance, Mayor Wu stated that there was no precedent to follow and it was difficult to comply. The total number of civil servants in the city is estimated at 100,000, requiring a total of 150 billion yuan, which the municipal government simply cannot raise. Regarding the issuance of winter clothing allowances by the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, it was believed that business organizations and administrative organizations should be distinguished, so they cannot be treated as one. Mayor Wu stated that the request of the municipal school teachers could be retained, and if there was such a method in any other part of the country, Mayor Wu would definitely find a way to achieve it.</p>
<p>Salary Advance Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the advance of one month's salary, Mayor Wu has consulted with Director Gu of the Finance Bureau and decided to advance half a month's salary on the 31st of this month and to issue January's salary before January 15th, within the Lunar New Year. Furthermore, the central government's order to adjust civil servant salaries was announced precisely on the 27th. According to the representatives, the adjusted salary will increase by about 60%, but the total amount will still not exceed 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Salary Payment Date Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of paying salaries before the 10th of each month, Mayor Wu stated that this was not a delay by the authorities, but purely because the Municipal Finance Bureau had no income before the 10th. All tax revenues must be paid in at the earliest on the 15th, so the salaries of municipal school teachers can only be expedited to the extent possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the municipal schools in the suburban areas of Zhenru, Yangsi, etc., not having received salaries for three months, Mayor Wu stated that this was not within his responsibility and was likely due to delays in procedures by the auditing office. The director and deputy director of the Education Bureau have guaranteed to issue salaries on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>General Leave Issue</p>
<p>Mayor Wu believed that it was inappropriate for municipal school faculty and staff to take a general leave of absence on January 6th, as teachers should consider their status and should not threaten with a strike, which would likely not gain the sympathy of the public and the general intellectual class. He also instructed that any future actions must be communicated to Mayor Wu and Director Gu in advance. Mayor Wu stated that he was not unsympathetic to the municipal school teachers, but was powerless until the country's entire economy was back on track.</p>
<p>Whether the municipal school teachers will implement a general leave of absence on January 6th is still uncertain. A final decision will be made at the tenth general meeting of members on January 5th.</p>
<p>They are also preparing a proposal to make a final appeal to the second Municipal Council, as the Municipal Council had previously discussed improving and adjusting the salaries of municipal school faculty and staff based on fair and reasonable principles.</p>

<h3>College Basketball Tournament Opens; St. John's Heavily Defeated Aurora Yesterday; Physical Education College Men's and Women's Teams Beat Lixin Women's Team</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The inaugural Shanghai College Basketball League opened yesterday afternoon at the Jiaotong University gymnasium. There were three games: Physical Education College vs. Lixin, St. John's vs. Physical Education College (women), and St. John's vs. Aurora. More than 2,000 spectators attended, creating a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Physical Education College Men's and Women's Teams Win Double Victories</p>
<p>In the opening game, Lixin faced the Physical Education College. The referees were Zhang Juefei and Chu Jianhong. The Lixin team was only formed within two weeks and lacked strategy and technique. Facing the strong and robust Physical Education College, they had no choice but to admit defeat, but their spirit was excellent, and they were undeterred despite the loss. Zhang Mingcun of the Physical Education College scored the first points with two free throws. In the first quarter, the Physical Education College led 11-2. In the first half, the Physical Education College held an absolute advantage with a score of 33-4. In the second half, Yang Zuxin and Jiang Shiping of Lixin were penalized for their fifth fouls and were successively sent off. The Physical Education College also did not have any exciting performances. The score in the third quarter was 36-6. As a result, the Physical Education College heavily defeated Lixin 49-10.</p>
<p>The second game was the women's group, with the Physical Education College women facing St. John's. The referee was Zhang Juefei. The St. John's players had bright uniforms and neat attire, and there was a male student cheering squad, but they could not withstand the attack of the strong Physical Education College women. However, the Physical Education College also lacked excitement yesterday, resulting in a very close score difference. The result was 17-8.</p>
<p>St. John's Men's Team Heavily Defeated Aurora</p>
<p>In the featured game, St. John's faced Aurora. The referees were Yang Liecheng and Yuan Qicai. The St. John's players were tall and burly, while the Aurora players were mostly short. In addition, St. John's had the Encas-born Bauley as center, and with Zhu Mingxing and Wu Xinyun's accurate shooting, they led all the way. Aurora was no match for them. In the first half, St. John's held an absolute advantage with a score of 31-8. In the second half, Wu Xinyun took the lead again, and Zhu Mingxing and Tao Yingshi repeatedly made great contributions. Chen Bohan, the short tiger of Aurora, made several attacks, but all failed. As a result, St. John's heavily defeated Aurora 58-15.</p>

Starting at 3:00 PM today, originally Tongde was scheduled to face Business College, the women's team of Hujiang against Lixin, and Hujiang against Datong as the featured game. However, Hujiang is a church school and cannot participate today, so the organizers have decided to reschedule them. Therefore, there is only one college team game.</p>

<h3>Blood! Fire! Tears! A Horrific Tragedy in Chahar Province: The Massacre of Chongli - Every Family Has Deaths, Every Household Has Cries</h3>
<p>— Zhangjiakou, 20th Dispatch, Our Correspondent, Jiezhong</p>
<p>Just as the National Assembly was being held with great enthusiasm, discussing democratic governance and guaranteeing the freedom of the people, the Communist army in Chongli County, Chahar Province, with their bloody hands, orchestrated a shocking tragedy of slaughtering the people. What a heart-wrenching contrast this reality presents!</p>
<p>The Chongli tragedy, like the news of "Instrument Air" (a previous massacre incident), has spread widely throughout Chahar Province and the entire country. In recent days, the people of Zhangjiakou have become even more somber. Under the heavy burden of life, they are now shrouded in the shadow of terror. Stories of the Communist army's brutal killings are circulating in the streets and alleys, and refugees fleeing the disaster are tearfully recounting the horrors they experienced. On the afternoon of the 20th, the citizens of Zhangjiakou held a grand memorial service for the compatriots who died in Chongli County. The anger of 170,000 hearts surged like a raging tide. When the tragic scenes of the victims were presented before the people, their hair stood on end, and their hearts were filled with grief and indignation. Anyone with human compassion could not help but tremble with cold fear.</p>
<p>Commander Shi and All Officers and Soldiers Died in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are as follows: On December 9th, the Communist army, with a force of three brigades and over ten thousand troops, attacked Chongli County. Because the defending forces were vastly outnumbered and the defenses were weak, Commander Shi Yushan and all his officers and soldiers died in the line of duty. Over two hundred local Home Guard members and civilians held out in the Catholic Church, fighting for an entire day. Until the afternoon, the Communist army used artillery fire to burn down the church, and a horrific massacre began.</p>
<p>More than seven hundred unfortunate farmers in Chongli County were taken as prisoners, tied up in strings, and marched to a street corner. Two or thirty of them were killed at a time. They wanted to demonstrate their power and vent their anger by killing people. Finally, they herded the remaining three hundred or so people to the southeastern corner of the city and mowed them down with machine guns.</p>
<p>In a corner of the church, more than ten charred limbs were found. It is said that more than eighty civilians were burned to ashes in that building.</p>
<p>Orphanage in the Church: Scenes of Pain and Suffering Everywhere</p>
<p>On the 15th, when reporters inspected and entered Chongli, smoke still lingered from the burned-down church. Scarlet bloodstains were everywhere, along with frozen corpses. Everywhere there were cries of pain and sorrowful wails.</p>
<p>Entering the only remaining orphanage in the church, reporters encountered two young women who had returned without finding their husbands' bodies. They stood there, staring blankly, as if appealing to God. Several foreign nuns in white robes, with tears streaming down their faces, sobbed in broken Chinese: "This time... this time... people are killed, the church is burned, and everything is looted! The orphanage was already stocked with firewood and ready to be burned. The children knelt down and begged for a long time before it was spared..." More than a hundred pitiful little lives – orphans from a few months to eight or nine years old – held their hands together and cried: "Don't leave, please leave a few more soldiers, we are afraid!" Their tragic cries, like needles, pierced everyone's nerves.</p>
<p>Captain Zheng Zhonghuai: His Entire Family Was Massacred</p>
<p>Zheng Zhonghuai, the head of the Self-Defense Force, had his entire family, totaling twelve members, brutally murdered.</p>
<p>The only government employee who survived the Communist army's massacre was Zhang Jian, the secretary of the county government. He told reporters: "This time, the Communist army killed the people of our Chongli County too brutally! Adults, children, the elderly, and women were stripped of their clothes and killed on the spot. The total number is over five hundred. The number of missing people is no less than two thousand. Women cry for their husbands, old men cry for their sons, and children cry for their parents. Whether day or night, there is always a chorus of wails..."</p>
<p>After the massacre, the Communist army looted all the property, even taking away unfinished shoe soles. The dead cannot be buried, and the living have no clothes or food. They are all staring with bloodshot eyes, demanding revenge from the demons!</p>
<p>From the images captured by reporters, readers will see fragments of the Chongli tragedy. Let them tell the story of the crimes of the so-called progressive and democratic party!</p>
<p>Children in Their Teens: Thrown into the Fire Pit</p>
<p>The military and civilians slaughtered in Chongli County numbered only a little over a thousand lives. In today's era of constant warfare and massacres, with tens of thousands of casualties at every turn, this is not a particularly alarming number. The seriousness of the tragedy itself lies not only in the number of deaths but especially in the cruelty of the deaths. These were not casualties on the battlefield but a planned massacre after the fighting ended, especially targeting soldiers who had lost their ability to fight and innocent elderly, young, and women. How could they be subjected to such torture? We cannot understand how such a vicious heart could exist!</p>
<p>A foreign priest said: "I am over sixty years old this year, and I have been preaching for over forty years. I have been through both World Wars, but I have never seen such a tragic and terrifying scene. They killed priests, burned down churches, and more than two hundred civilians were burned alive. A child in his teens escaped but was thrown back into the fire pit. How cruel is that!" It turns out that the Communist army has created an art of killing here!</p>
<p>A Female Corpse on the Street: Eyes Dug Out into Black Holes</p>
<p>On the side of a street in the county town, a female corpse lay horizontally. Her breasts and nose had been cut off, her eyes were two black holes, and she was naked, stuck in a pool of frozen blood.</p>
<p>Another young man had his hands and feet nailed to a tree trunk, his arms and legs hanging from the branches, the expression of pain on his face not yet obscured by the blood and mud. An old man in his seventies had his brains smashed and his genitals cut off, his two skinny, skin-and-bone arms still tightly bound behind him.</p>
<p>Terror and misery envelop Chongli. Every family has deaths, every household has cries. There is no greater hell on earth than this!</p>
<p>The Communist army's tail-end killing in Chongli County gives people the impression that the red terror has begun. This tragedy may become increasingly horrible! Assuming that the Communist Party still wants to talk about revolution, the foundation of the revolution should not be detached from the masses. Military efforts cannot compensate for political failures. The lost popular support cannot be coerced with terror and retaliation. The people are indeed weak, but when they cannot tolerate humiliation and their lives are to be taken away, the flames of anger will destroy any oppressive force!</p>
<h3>Speaking of Fengqiu with Tears (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng, 19th Dispatch by Airmail, Our Correspondent in Bian, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>Fengqiu is like a mirror. In the mirror, you can see endless desolation, misery, danger, and terrifying shadows. But at the same time, you can also see endless tension, excitement, vigor, and bright things.</p>
<p>Fengqiu is like a warm room without closed windows. Here, you can taste the bone-chilling wind, but at the same time, you can enjoy the warmth of spring.</p>
<p>Fengqiu is in suffering, Fengqiu is in progress, Fengqiu is progressing in suffering, and Fengqiu is suffering in progress. When can it get rid of suffering? It can immediately become a corner of the new China.</p>
<p>Fengqiu – this small county in the sand dunes, for me, there was only a plain, poor, desolate, and lonely image. I had never even dreamed of going to this desolate and ordinary place. But an unexpected opportunity finally brought me to this corner of the future new China, and I had a twenty-four-hour stay. In those twenty-four hours, I saw many things, and I also discovered many new topics. I am no longer indifferent to this place as I was before. I will never forget this place. I hope that it will soon become an oasis in the desert, and I also want to describe its current appearance.</p>
<p>Worried Little City</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon on the 16th, amid flying sand and dust, two jeeps and a sedan car carrying us eleven news reporters from Kaifeng (in addition to the reporter and Mr. Li Xinlin from Ta Kung Pao, the rest were all reporters from Kaifeng) drove into Fengqiu. On the speeding car, we saw a dilapidated city gate tower from afar. Outside the city gate, there was a long queue like a snake. Although people usually praised us as the "uncrowned kings," we ourselves had never dared to hold ourselves in such high esteem.</p>
<p>The car stopped, and a group of people surrounded us. They were Chief of Staff Hu from the Fifth Pacification Zone Command stationed in Fengqiu, Director Chen of the Political Department, Deputy Chief of Staff Lei from the Command, County Magistrate Liu, Speaker Liu, Secretary Jia of the County Party Committee, Secretary Long of the Youth League, and Mr. Wang Faping, a provincial senator from the county. Everyone exchanged business cards and shook hands tightly, and then walked into the city. Military music sounded. In the majestic and melodious military music, we passed before the two-mile-long queue with mixed feelings of gratitude and shame. They were the directly subordinate troops and all officers of the Fifth Pacification Zone Command, the Hua County United High School, the Jian Normal School, the Zhongzheng School, the Central School, the police station, and the various departments of the county government. What was most striking was the row of people's teams. They were wearing long robes, carrying broadswords on their shoulders, and holding spears in their hands. The formation was so neat and their spirit so full. As we walked past them, they greeted us with their eyes, making us feel very excited and sad. "What will we use to thank them?" we asked ourselves inwardly.</p>
<p>In the tense melody, we stepped into this small city that had experienced many worries. On the narrow streets of the city, all eyes were curiously watching our group of disheveled figures. We looked at them and looked at the wall newspapers and slogans all over the street: "News reporters are the mouthpiece of the people," "News reporters are the mentors of society," "Welcome news reporters to give us guidance and criticism," "News reporters coming to Fengqiu can give us light and reduce our pain," "..." The heavy burden and earnest hope made us feel even more uneasy. What can we say for them? What can we do for them? In this situation of feeling unworthy of such treatment, we could not help but question our own strength.</p>
<p>A face covered with dust, just washed away by several basins of hot water from the Political Department, Director Chen Shengren Yuanxiang of the Political Department took out a program that had been prepared in advance for us by various local sectors. The program was as follows: at 3:00 PM on the 16th, Director Chen of the Political Department hosted a banquet; at 4:00 PM, an interview with Commander Sun; at 4:30 PM, a visit to various agencies and schools; at 6:00 PM, Commander Sun hosted a banquet; at 6:30 PM, a welcome party (the Command's Juvenile Soldier Team performed Peking Opera); at 7:00 AM the next morning, participate in the joint morning meeting and give a speech; at 8:00 AM, breakfast; at 8:30 AM, a symposium with local political groups; at 11:00 AM, a joint public banquet by local sectors; at 12:00 PM, a military symposium; and at 2:00 PM, farewell.</p>
<p>The arranged program did not allow us to refuse. Everyone ate a meal hosted by Director Chen at the Political Department, and then we were accompanied by Director Chen to visit General Sun Zhen, the commander of the Pacification Zone. General Sun Zhen is a figure recently considered by the Chinese Communists to be lonely and sad, saying that he is currently the only military officer in Sichuan with troops, and he has endless distress and complaints. The central government has always discriminated against him, and he has embarked on a path of sadness. This old general, who has experienced hundreds of battles, has contributed to the country, and has been in the revolutionary ranks since following Cai Songpo's uprising, and has been known as the "Little Hegemon" for his courageous fighting, transferred to the Lu, Yu, and E provinces for seven years during the Anti-Japanese War, guarding the gateway to the capital and laying the foundation for victory, and earlier walked to relieve the siege of Kaifeng, and this time wielded his sword to quell the chaos of Fengqiu and Hua, is he now sad and distressed? I thought this way on the way to the Command.</p>
<p>Just as we walked into General Sun's courtyard, General Sun and his Deputy Commander Dong greeted us with smiles. General Sun is a refined figure in his fifties. With his gentle and elegant demeanor, if he were not wearing a three-star general's collar and a military uniform, no one would have thought that this was General Sun Nong, who commanded thousands of troops and horses and wrote many glorious histories for the Republic of China with blood, tears, wisdom, and courage. Chairman Chiang praised him as an excellent and pure model soldier, and General Li Zongren respected him as a "Martial Saint." Now it seems that this is not without reason.</p>
<p>After everyone shook hands, we went into the house and exchanged greetings for a while. We waited for him to speak, but he always sat there politely, as if he were shy to see strangers, and kept his mouth shut. After everyone sat for ten minutes, Director Chen knew General Sun's temper very well, and also knew that if we didn't ask, he would be embarrassed to say more, so he took the liberty of saying goodbye for us, and went outside to visit various agencies and schools, but at this time General Sun was a little reluctant to let us go.</p>
<p>Admiring the Ancient Well</p>
<p>Outside the back door of the Command is a calm lake. In the center of the lake is an ancient well. Several small paths lead from the shore of the lake to the well. Porters are drawing water from this ancient well, carrying three loads at a time. Director Chen told us that this is an ancient well, and the so-called Zhai Mother Well refers to this. Its origin is as follows: It is said that when Emperor Gaozu of Han was in exile, he suffered from hunger and cold here. At that time, an old lady surnamed Zhai could not bear to sit idly by and gave him a meal. Later, Emperor Gaozu obtained the throne, and remembering this kindness, he hurried here to see the old lady. However, the old lady was unfortunate and short-lived. She did not wait for Emperor Gaozu to repay her, and she died lonely. Emperor Gaozu arrived here, and was saddened by the news. As a result, he sealed the old lady's mound (the naming of Fengqiu County is derived from this), and because the old lady lived by the well before her death, he also sealed the well as the Zhai Mother Well. We walked to the well and looked at it for a long time, feeling bored, and then walked along the road that had been flown.</p>
<p>Juvenile Soldier Team</p>
<p>To the east of Zhai Mother Well is a magnificent mansion. A white wooden sign is hung at the entrance, with the words "Fifth Pacification Zone Command Juvenile Soldier Team" written on it. As we walked into the entrance, a juvenile soldier team was lined up at the entrance to welcome us. There were forty people in the line, the oldest about ten years old, and the youngest about thirteen or fourteen years old, with energetic spirits and solemn appearances. We secretly cheered. Walking into the door, we visited their tidy and clean internal affairs and saw their well-organized classrooms. Everyone felt very satisfied. Chief Lei and us walked and said that he set up this juvenile soldier team to take in displaced children from all over the country during the Anti-Japanese War. Originally, the plan was to provide them with pre-military education, but later, in order to make their lives more enjoyable and to encourage the soldiers' emotions with their lifestyle, in addition to military education, they were also taught some new and old dramas. Now they have also learned a lot of Peking Opera. In recent years, when the military has lacked spiritual food, they have indeed given the soldiers and the masses an infinite number of substitutes. As we spoke, we had already walked out of this courtyard and went to the Hua County United Normal School.</p>
<p>Schools and Agencies</p>
<p>The provincial Hua County United High School and Fengqiu Jian Normal School are one door and two counters, with a total of 711 students, 562 in the United High School and 149 in the Jian Normal School. Each school has its own classes, but because the teachers' salaries were different, the two schools averaged the teachers' salaries, and the teachers were used by both sides regardless of each other. The students dared not relax their learning opportunities in the extremely difficult conditions. When we entered their school in the fading twilight, some students were still groping for their homework in the dark classrooms.</p>
<p>After leaving the Hua County United High School and passing through the Zhongzheng Park, which was under construction, we arrived at the newly established Zhongzheng School. This school was dedicated to celebrating Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. From planning, donations, enrollment, to the start of classes, it has been less than seventy days. However, looking at the magnificent school buildings that have been transformed and the uniform teaching equipment, we were a little surprised. The palace-style school gate is only slightly smaller than the school gate of Henan University. The dormitories, classrooms, green pillars, and red windows are antique and unusually magnificent. There are currently two junior high school classes with a total of 88 students and six elementary school classes with 180 students. This is jointly organized by the Fifth Pacification Zone and the local government. It is said that it was only launched on Double Ten Day. All officers and soldiers of the Command donated 20 million yuan, and local sectors donated 20 million yuan. In this way, 40 million yuan was used to establish this large-scale school. Now the students here are comfortably taking classes. According to the person in charge of the school, the 40 million yuan fund, 10 million yuan was spent on construction, 10 million yuan was spent on equipment, and the remaining 20 million yuan is now planned to purchase real estate as a permanent fund. If the above expenditure figures are accurate, this implicitly illustrates the Zhongzheng College of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>It was already dark, and we hurriedly went back to the Youth League.</p>
<p>Time was running out, and Commander Sun's banquet was changed to 9:00 AM the next morning. We went directly from the Senate Council to participate in the Juvenile Soldier Team's welcome party.</p>
<p>Welcome Party</p>
<p>The welcome party was held by the Juvenile Soldier Team at the Bian Family Courtyard. The stage was full of things, but the box made of nine Taiping Army pieces was a little uneven. Four Peking Opera plays were sung at the party: "Great Ascension Palace," "Empty City Strategy," and "Meilong Town," all of which were well-sung and well-performed. The finale was "Relying on Xingfu's Pouch," and the martial arts were skilled and sophisticated, certainly not comparable to ordinary children's opera troupes. It started at 6:30 and ended at 9:30. We watched three hours of wonderful Peking Opera in pleasure, and then shook hands with Commander Sun and returned to the reception center to rest.</p>
<p>After eating dinner at the reception center, Director Chen Yuanxiang was still reluctant to part and chatted with us. Everyone seemed like old friends who had reunited after a long separation, talking incessantly until after 11:00.</p>
<p>Night Talk of Heroes</p>
<p>From 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM, we were spinning around in tension. Director Chen, Deputy Chief Lei, Director Jiang, and others who were entertaining us were also playing along in the tense melody. Everyone did not feel tired at all. Some surrounded the stove and talked with Chief Lei about the current military situation, while others sat side by side with Director Mei and talked about military culture. But I was discussing heroes with Director Chen under the lamp.</p>
<p>"Is General Sun always so unwilling to talk? I have many things that I need to understand about him. I don't know if he is willing to tell me?" I asked Director Chen this way.</p>
<p>He replied with a humorous touch: "You are unlucky. The interview object you met will never allow you to achieve your goal. If you want to understand him, there is no other way except to ask you to be a guest here for half a year. Because although he is like a lively dragon and tiger on the battlefield where warhorses are galloping, he is like a secluded and refined scholar in his peacetime life. He is afraid of seeing strangers, especially news reporters. He is very happy in his heart that you have come, but he doesn't know how to entertain you guests, let alone what to say to you. Therefore, when he met you this afternoon, he never said much. I think that even if you visit him alone tomorrow, there will be no good results." "This is indeed an unexpected and interesting thing for me. General Sun has been fighting for half his life. Why is he afraid of seeing us news reporters with only a bald pen? According to you, I will not be able to understand this general. But you are an old friend of the press. Can you introduce me to General Sun as you know him?" I also asked him with a smile.</p>
<p>"I know too little, because I have been here for less than half a year. I only know that he has no wife and has been single for more than 30 years. I heard that a person of importance once wanted him to remarry, which resulted in a story of 'sealing gold and hanging up the seal.' Later, no one persuaded him anymore. He is naturally indifferent and easy-going, has no hobbies, likes to read, and likes to encourage people to read. He can absolutely obey his superiors, and his kindness to his subordinates outweighs his prestige."</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Market Dynamics</h3>
<p>— 20th Dispatch by Airmail, Our Special Correspondent, Kang Feng</p>
<p>Since the autumn harvest, the Wuhu rice market has not been very prosperous in exports. There are many reasons, and the fact that the price of rice in the Wuhu rice market is sometimes higher than that of Wuxi in Jiangsu, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, and Hankou in Hubei, and Changsha in Hunan is one of them. The distance of transportation from Wuhu to the rice-collecting areas is also an important factor. For example, the Guangchao gang, which has always collected rice in Wuhu, is purchasing some grain from Hunan because the Yuehan Railway has been restored; therefore, the Wuhu rice market has been quite lacking since the autumn harvest, waiting for a big stomach customer to absorb it.</p>
<p>The Wuhu branch of the Farmers Bank of China was ordered to purchase some grain in Anhui as military grain and public grain. After the pilot project for 21 days, only one-tenth of the originally ordered futures rice was delivered. After that, they had to try to purchase from other smaller rice markets outside the Wuhu rice market. Therefore, not long ago, news spread that the rice market would be moved from Wuhu to Yuxikou on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Wang Zhupu, the person in charge of the Wuhu rice industry, and others certainly could not sit idly by and watch the Wuhu rice market merchants even find it difficult to take on the supply of grain purchased by the Farmers Bank. Therefore, they invited Speaker Chen Zhuofu and others to discuss and agree to provide guarantees to the Farmers Bank in accordance with real estate and reliable guarantors, and to be responsible for the supply of grain for this purchase by the Farmers Bank at prices that were no lower than the market price and no higher than the market price.</p>
<p>The Farmers Bank, which is carrying out this purchase, is certainly more satisfactory to the people of Anhui than the Anhui Provincial Government's purchase of military grain in 1945, because this time the rice is purchased at the market price for cash, while the grain purchased by the Anhui Provincial Government on behalf of the Ministry of Food in the winter of 1945 was generally purchased at the low price set by the Ministry of Food, and the payment time was two or three months after the rice and paddy were handed over, so that the urban and rural people who sold the grain were equivalent to being taken away by the government.</p>
<p>In Wuhu, which is in a commercial slump and experiencing the hardships of December, if the purchase of grain from the Farmers Bank can be done firmly and with credit, it is possible that more than 10 billion yuan of funds will flow into the pockets of rural farmers, urban merchants, and dock workers, which can make this parasitic commercial city of Wuhu appear active and get through the New Year. However, the economic recovery and prosperity of Wuhu and the entire Anhui province still awaits a more rational national economic policy to stimulate and promote!</p>

<h3>Watching Cheng Yanqiu Perform "Spring Boudoir Dream"</h3>
<p>— Ma Huixin</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's "Spring Boudoir Dream" is imbued with the meaning of "Pitiful are the bones by the unresting river, all are dreamers in spring boudoirs." It can be called a sister piece to Cheng's "Wilderness Cries," both being dramas that pray for peace and oppose war.</p>
<p>The story is set during the civil war of the Later Han Dynasty, when governors and other officials conscripted soldiers from the people, causing widespread hardship. Wang Hui and others from Pingyuan were conscripted into the army. Wang Hui and his wife, Zhang, had a very deep affection for each other. Less than half a month after their wedding, they were forced to part. Later, Zhang vaguely heard rumors of her husband's misfortune, and overcome with anxiety and longing, she fell into a dream. In the dream, she was surprised to meet Wang again, and she couldn't help but feel a mixture of resentment and joy. Upon waking and realizing it was a dream, her grief was unbearable.</p>
<p>The young male lead in this performance is Chu Jinpeng. Chu's appearance can be described with the four words "graceful and luxurious." He and Cheng were very well-matched, appearing like a newlywed couple. Furthermore, his beautiful figure left the audience with a beautiful impression.</p>
<p>"Spring Boudoir Dream" is a tragedy, so two clowns – the ugly maid and Li Xin – were added to the play to interject some humorous elements, providing the audience with some relief and preventing the bitter and tragic emotions from weighing heavily on their hearts. This was originally a good idea. However, in the third scene, "Farewell at the Long Pavilion," they were not allowed to appear alone but were forced to appear together. As a result, because of their jokes, the climax of the drama's tragic emotions was diluted, which is regrettable. Originally, the plot of this scene, "Farewell at the Long Pavilion, parting in life and death," with its sorrowful and melancholic lyrics, expressions, and tragic scenes such as the "crying head," could have easily captured the audience's emotions. After moving the audience with the preceding scenes, letting the clown duo perform some jokes would still have allowed the audience to wipe away their tears and then smile again.</p>
<p>In the final scene, "Awakening from the Spring Boudoir Dream," both singing and acting are crucial. Cheng's inner expressions and the skill of her water sleeves were excellent. Especially when she sang, "When I left, the flowers on the road were like brocade; today, the willows on the tower are green again; pitifully, I wait in the deep boudoir, thinking of this day since the sea-棠 bloomed... After all, men are mostly ungrateful, 'misleading others' is the essence of their fame; sweet words and honeyed phrases are indeed pleasing to hear, who knows they are all meaningless affection!" She playfully and lovingly flicked her water sleeves towards her husband whom she encountered in the dream, which was truly vivid and beautiful! It can truly be said: A boudoir complaint, expressed with a flick of the sleeve.</p>
<p>The use of light and ethereal music during the dream sequence is a manifestation of improved performance techniques in the Peking Opera world. Unfortunately, the lighting did not gradually dim to indicate the slow transition into a dream, but instead went dark suddenly. This was not only inconsistent with the plot but also created an unpleasant sensation for the audience's eyes.</p>
<p>The Peking Opera world has been talking about improving Peking Opera for a long time. If famous actors can gradually pay attention to improvements on a regular basis, then Peking Opera will not only be easily eliminated but will also have a day when it shines even brighter than before.</p>
<p>"Spring Boudoir Dream" and "Wilderness Cries" are both successful masterpieces of Cheng. The artistic achievements of this generation of actors have reached the pinnacle of perfection.</p>
<h3>Discussing "Sergeant York"</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>"Sergeant York" is a story about the life of Alvin York, a famous hero of the Argonne Forest during World War I. The script is based on York's diaries. Fortunately, this hero is still alive, and Warner Brothers obtained the rights to produce this film, allowing this great work to be brought to the screen.</p>
<p>The first half of the film narrates York's rural life, while the latter half recounts his military history and experiences. The film uses York's changing religious beliefs as a dividing line and a pivot point for the transformation.</p>
<p>Although the dialogue in the script is filled with a strong religious atmosphere, the touching plot and performances overshadow everything else. The young York is a fun-loving drunkard who does not believe in God or religion. He has no interest in pastors or churches. His only interests are drinking, riding horses, and shooting. In the eyes of the old pastor, he is simply possessed by the devil. Therefore, the pastor tries to influence him with the compassionate and loving religious concept of saving the world, hoping to give him a powerful faith. However, all efforts fail, and the old pastor's hopes are dashed. York, who shoots all day long, meets a young woman. The true transformation in York's life probably begins at this time. How many people in history can escape this precedent? York is no exception. He begins to understand the importance of grooming himself. A person who could not be improved by any other force is now willing to bury himself in the fields and work hard all day because of love. York has awakened. He feels the greatness of love, and the power of God influences him. He realizes his past mistakes.</p>
<p>After converting to Christianity, under the protection of God's love, he becomes a most sincere believer. The Bible replaces all his previous hobbies. He discovers the true meaning of the book, and he opposes war because the Bible teaches him so. However, the laws of the country cannot be easily changed, and York is eventually drafted into the army. His superb shooting skills earn him the favor of his superiors, and he is promoted to sergeant. Because of his opposition to war, the officer grants him a ten-day leave to consider his decision. On a mountain peak at sunset, York carries two books: the Bible and "American History," a record of the struggle for liberalism. York begins to feel confused. Should he obey God and oppose all murderous wars? Or should he fight to defend his country, for freedom and equality? Looking at the beautiful rivers and mountains of his country, the great York chooses the latter. Although war is harmful to the people, it is still necessary to use war to eliminate cruel wars. This does not conflict with religious doctrine, so York participates in the war with a sacred sense of purpose.</p>
<p>After watching "Sergeant York," I always have this feeling: "Sergeant York" and "A Song to Remember" are too similar. The great York and the genius Chopin have their similarities; both are troubled by women. York realizes the true meaning of war and joins the army, while Chopin regrets everything and plays the piano to dedicate himself to his country. Although the events are different, the intentions are the same, and their hesitant attitudes are also similar. The old pastor's guidance of York to believe in religion is also very similar to the situation of the old professor in "A Song to Remember." The soil in "Sergeant York" is an unwillingness to forget the fields below the mountain, while the soil in "A Song to Remember" is an unwillingness to forget his homeland of Poland. Everything is somewhat similar.</p>
<p>Similarly, the directors of both films are afraid that focusing solely on the development of the story will lead to boredom, so they insert some humorous scenes from time to time. There are also many touching scenes in this film: York's mother pours a basin of cold water on his head; York works hard to save money to buy land, recording his progress on a calendar with a pen; when the deadline is approaching and he still hasn't reached his goal, York is desperate, screaming in anger, and the valley echoes; sitting quietly on the mountain, the setting sun reflects on York as he struggles to think and act. Almost all the meaningful scenes in the film depict York.</p>
<p>The director's technique is very concise and clever. York's fight with his rival is narrated through dialogue and then contrasted with the scene of his rival staggering away, which is very effective. Only the scene of York returning home after his victory seems too long. Other than that, the audience is very satisfied.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Gary Cooper, who plays York, is simply flawless. The carelessness and glibness in his conversations with the old pastor are wonderfully accurate. Other aspects, such as his sincere attitude, humorous actions, and courageous fighting, are all performed with great effort. The old pastor is also very good.</p>
<p>Also particularly worth mentioning is the musical accompaniment, which is perfectly matched with the plot. The music effectively captures the emotions of ease, tension, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, completely engaging the audience.</p>
<p>I believe this is a deeply moving film.</p>
<h3>Sending the New China Theatre Company to Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The members of the New China Theatre Company and several other theatre groups have struggled in the Southwest for several years, with many efforts and achievements. However, after the victory, they suffered a tragic setback. They drifted and moved around, unable to find stability. In today's China, where people's representatives are desperately destroying the art gardens that the people have painstakingly cultivated, this is not surprising.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is Taiwan to go to, and fortunately, Taiwan has them to go to, which is a welcome thing.</p>
<p>Taiwan was ceded to Japan on March 23rd of the twenty-first year of the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. After a long period of oppression by the enemy, it finally longed for the return of the motherland. However, what is the life of the Taiwanese people like today? What are their views on the motherland? What are their impressions of the people of the motherland? Do they not feel disappointed and disillusioned?</p>
<p>Your trip will not only introduce the new and emerging dramatic arts of the motherland to the Taiwanese compatriots but, more importantly, it will show the Taiwanese compatriots another part of the people of the motherland, so as to re-encourage their courage.</p>
<p>Your performance of plays such as "Zheng Chenggong" is very appropriate. This can tell the Taiwanese compatriots, tell the Chinese people, how the heroes of the past struggled hard and fought alone to preserve a corner of Chinese territory. The current "heroes" are: the so-called heroes of today are far from the heroes of the past. We cannot wait for those heroes to be born. We can only work hard ourselves, mind our own business, remove all obstacles to democracy, and only then will the arts have a future, and the country will have a future. I hope everyone will work hard.</p>

<h3>Factionalism in the Theatre World</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiahao</p>
<p>We cannot deny that the existence of "factionalism" is one of the factors contributing to the current stagnation of the theatre world. This extremely bad phenomenon should have been eradicated long ago, but everyone is unconsciously allowing it to grow deeply rooted.</p>
<p>As early as five years ago, when I stepped into the theatre circle, I gradually learned about the traditional bad habits within the circle. Due to different working styles, there were distinctions between the "academic school" and the "Shanghai school." Due to different working positions, the purpose of the work was questioned... A playwright, a director, an actor... could also lead a group of people to form small circles and small systems similar to a team-based organization. Therefore, in the Chongqing theatre scene over the years, out of ten points of strength of theatre workers, three points had to be spent dealing with personnel matters caused by "factionalism," preventing them from going all out. This is truly the most heartbreaking thing! This strange phenomenon has produced the greatest evil consequence: "Factionalism" is not easy to eliminate, and you can forget about standing firm if you don't have a system. Therefore, these small circles and small organizations have been playing tricks such as snatching theatres and scripts under the premise of glorifying their "faction." In order to achieve their goals, they sometimes do not hesitate to undermine and accuse each other... making the entire theatre world filled with smoke and miasma. After the victory, the transfer of the theatre movement center to Shanghai added another gap between "Shanghai" and "Chongqing." Can you say that this is not a fact? I don't want to dig any further. I hope that in today's low tide of spoken drama, every worker who loves the art of theatre will quickly take out their artistic conscience to eliminate "factionalism" and save the fate of the theatre! Only "sincere unity" can resist external pressures—only "sincere acquaintance" can be self-reliant!</p>

<p>"Returning Home in Glory" Begins Filming</p>
<p>"Returning Home in Glory," written by Gu Erye and directed by Zhao Dan, began filming last week. The story is set against the background of the victory recovery, and it satirizes the extravagance and darkness during the takeover period. The film is scheduled to be completed before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>War and Film</p>
<p>Film producer Franklin, who was responsible for producing famous films such as "Lost Horizon," "The Good Earth," and "The Life of Emile Zola," and "Waterloo Bridge," reportedly said that the United States will have better films in the next few years. It took several years after World War I for the film industry to produce famous films such as "The Merry Widow" and "All Quiet on the Western Front." Therefore, the masterpieces after this war will still have to wait, it is said.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Fantasia</p>
<p>Beethoven, Schubert, Bach, Tchaikovsky, and others' realm of dreams is infinitely sublimated here. We criticized "Saludos Amigos" and "Dumbo," and some people even criticized "The Reluctant Dragon." Only the first full-length cartoon "Snow White" still enjoys great reputation. Therefore, Walt Disney's abilities were gradually neglected. Now, after watching "Fantasia," we firmly believe in Walt Disney's artistic talent. "Fantasia" is the highest peak of his talent, which can be said to be unprecedented, and perhaps also unsurpassed. Therefore, those later works such as "Saludos Amigos" and "Dumbo" are all eclipsed by comparison.</p>
<p>I believe that one of the failures of "A Song to Remember" is the lack of interpretation of Chopin's music. This aspect has always been very difficult. The boundless imagination of musicians and the emotionality of sound wave rhythms cannot be expressed by the camera. They are all ethereal and intangible. Trying to materialize them is always disappointing, just as Masao Koga could not express Debussy's symbolic beauty in "Afternoon of a Faun." Another shortcoming of "A Song to Remember" is that it is not grand enough, and the scale is too far from the vastness of the musical realm. We are grateful to Walt Disney's inspiration for these two points. "Fantasia" expresses the interpretation and expansion of emotions in the music in a detailed and exhaustive way. I think that even Beethoven and Schubert themselves would be surprised to see it. Walt Disney's exploration of the imaginative elements of their music is very creative, not only expressing many beauties that cannot be described in words but also depicting surrealism beyond imagination. "Fantasia" is worthy of the immortal glory of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>"Fantasia" is a suite composed of six pieces of music. The expressions in the performances are all vivid and delightful. Personally, I like Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony," Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker," "Night on Bald Mountain," and "The Rite of Spring." Sprites, mushroom dances, flower dances, little fairies, and flying ghosts are the most beautiful of the beautiful. The first piece sweeps away Bach's thoughts on celestial bodies, completely abstract, using light waves to rhythmically express sound waves, which is incredibly magical. Stokowski is a great conductor of our time, and his hands can indeed summon wind and rain.</p>
<p>Going My Way</p>
<p>Watching "Fantasia" is a happiness, watching "Going My Way" is a comfort. "Going My Way" is a page of ink painting of the world. Ink paintings do not have colorful hues, but they have their own clear and elegant, and peaceful characteristics. With a few light strokes, all philosophies are said.</p>
<p>The screenwriter has the concept of "human nature is good at the beginning." None of the characters in the play are bad people, but none of them are purely perfect people. The marrow of the whole play is a sentence from the old pastor: He always thinks of others. In other words, that person who always takes care of others, always sacrifices himself, and is not selfish. If everyone is like this, why worry about the dangers of the world? He suffers losses to help others, and in the end, he gains nothing. He quietly walks away on the snowy ground, Going My Way. Watching his lonely shadow, you suspect that no one is accompanying him, but his love and the love that others have for him, accompanied by God, are indeed Going My Way with him. The role of this young priest is extremely well written, neither soft nor fiery, just right. His character is portrayed step by step, layer by layer. He tells us that priests are also mortals. He can play jazz music, he also likes to be noisy, and he also has a romantic past. Although he became a Buddha on the spot, his nature still remains. He does not use force or speeches to improve the world. With a light wave of emotion, he arranges the seeds of happiness. We used to dislike religious films because their dryness, dullness, and high-pitched tones put us to sleep. Therefore, I passed on "The Bells of St. Mary's," but here, I enthusiastically recommend the light and meaningful "Going My Way," this 1944 Academy Award-winning blockbuster.</p>
<p>Director Leo McCarey's technique is smooth and concise, especially in making a story without plot come alive, warm, and extraordinary. Bing Crosby's acting is sincere and lovely, and his low-pitched song is captivating. Barry Fitzgerald, who plays the old pastor, and the other supporting actors have made excellent achievements, which is no wonder they won awards.</p>
<p>Westerners sometimes imagine a kind of "strange woman," just like adventurous men, who take their lives, youth, happiness, and beauty to take risks. The British people's ideas are romantic and unbelievable. The Duchess of Jazz would actually become a robber. The plot is an extremely clever Melodrama, with too many intentionally arranged traces, without any reality or human touch. The director's handling of several shots is not bad. James Mason did not perform well, and Margaret Lockwood's appearance is similar to Hedy Lamarr. The one I appreciate the most is Patricia Roc, who plays Karena, who is delicate and beautiful. The male actors are too British. None of them are eye-catching.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Night in the Stable</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>It had been snowing all day, but now it had stopped, and the wind had died down. The moon peeked out from the clouds, shining on the open land, like draping a large silver fox fur coat.</p>
<p>The tops of a row of jujube trees were piled with white hair, dozing in the hazy moonlight. The birds in the trees, probably unable to withstand the cold, woke up from their dreams and began to coo.</p>
<p>Next to the jujube trees, there was a stable. The pillars and main beams were made of thin poplar wood, and the roof and walls were made of sorghum stalks. Thick snow weighed on the roof, making the entire stable look like an old man overwhelmed by a heavy burden, leaning to one side.</p>
<p>A kerosene lamp in the stable emitted a yellow flame, shining through the cracks in the sorghum stalks, illuminating the many icicles hanging from the eaves, which glowed faintly.</p>
<p>Two tall horses were tethered inside the stable, one all white and one brown with a white patch on its forehead. They were chewing on fodder in a wooden trough, occasionally bickering over unequal portions, whinnying, and kicking each other with their hind hooves, their horseshoes gleaming.</p>
<p>In another corner of the stable, a little grass was spread on the ground, and a middle-aged man in his forties was sitting on it, wearing a tattered gray military uniform and covered with a tattered quilt. His face was covered with wrinkles, and the wrinkles were filled with dust and sand. A large nose protruded from the center of his face, and a pair of large eyes with long, thick eyelashes flickered as if his eyelids were fighting with the Sandman, closing and opening intermittently. When his eyes closed, he could hear the regiment commander's stern order:</p>
<p>"Zhao Da, I'm promoting you to be my groom today. You must feed them well, only allowing them to get fat, not thin! Do you understand?..."</p>
<p>He startled, woke up, and saw that the two horses were still chewing on grass.</p>
<p>He guessed that the regiment commander must already be sound asleep in the middle of the night, and he could take this opportunity to sleep for a while. With this thought, his eyes quickly closed, and his head slowly drooped, bumping against the handle of an iron shovel leaning against the side.</p>
<p>Oh, this was an iron shovel, handed over to him by the previous groom. With this iron shovel, he could shovel horse manure and accumulate it, which could be... could be...</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he conjured up many worries, and the Sandman could no longer invade him for the moment.</p>
<p>Zhao Da had originally been a cook in the regiment headquarters. He couldn't cook, he could only chop firewood and stoke the fire. Many people laughed at his incompetence, and he could only endure it.</p>
<p>He had an old mother at home, a wife, and two children. His wife washed a few pieces of clothing for the officers every day, and her income could only support herself. The rest of the elderly and two young ones had to rely on him to support them. But how could a cook's income be enough?</p>
<p>Just at this moment, the regiment commander wanted to replace the groom. He asked someone to speak for him and only then did he get this "errand." Tonight was the first night he was officially "on duty" since he took office as groom. Although the groom's and cook's wages were about the same, it seemed to him that the groom was slightly better than the cook. At the same time, horse manure was valuable. Wouldn't the accumulated horse manure be several times larger than his own wages every day? "What? Don't want to do it?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he saw the white horse raising its tail, and he quickly stood up. His legs were a little numb because he had been sitting cross-legged for too long, and his body swayed slightly. He hurriedly grabbed the shovel, walked behind the white horse, and waited for the yellow "balls" to fall to the ground, then shoveled them into a wooden basket.</p>
<p>The horse manure steamed with heat, and a foul odor rushed into his nostrils:</p>
<p>"Taking the horse manure to feed his own old mother and children..." Thinking of this, he felt a pang of sadness in his heart, threw down the shovel, and sat back on the pile of grass.</p>
<p>He heard someone walking through the snow, making a crunching sound.</p>
<p>Who was it? Could it be the regiment commander coming to inspect? He sat still, not moving. Even though insects were biting him, he didn't move.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a middle-aged woman with disheveled hair and wrapped in a tattered quilt came into his sight.</p>
<p>"Why did you come out in the middle of the night?" He recognized his wife and asked sternly.</p>
<p>"...This..." She stammered, unable to say what she wanted to say, only moving a step closer and closing the door behind her. Her thin face was frozen red, and her eyes were a little swollen.</p>
<p>"What? What did you say?"</p>
<p>"This errand, it's better not to do it..."</p>
<p>"This errand, you have to stay up all night, and you have to take the horses out for a walk during the day. How can your body, your body, be able to handle it?" As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. Zhao Da lowered his head, looking at the white snow piled on his wife's shoes. Then, he raised his face again;</p>
<p>"You go back quickly! Don't worry about me!"</p>
<p>"I..." A couple of lines of hot tears finally fell.</p>
<p>"Go back quickly!" He stood up, opened the door woven with sorghum stalks with one hand, and pushed his wife out with the other. His wife almost fell over. After she went out, he quickly closed the door.</p>
<p>He stood there blankly, listening to his wife walking on the snow, making a "crunch, crunch, crunch" sound, slowly fading away from nearby.</p>
<p>"You must feed them well, only allowing them to get fat, not thin..." The regiment commander's order seemed to be ringing in his ears again.</p>
<p>"Neigh..." After eating his fill, the brown horse let out a happy neigh, and then the white horse echoed him. The two horses rubbed their heads against the pillars, shaking the entire stable.</p>
<h3>Poetic Words</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Qin</p>
<p>Don't simply list sentences of prose to become poetry; true poetry is the sand of emotion, the cage of the soul, the gold that is extracted through artistic skill</p>
<p>Making poetry is like climbing a mountain, each step more difficult than the last. Reaching halfway up, one turns back to see a haze of fog. Reaching the end, one suddenly sees a turning point, the smoke dispersing</p>
<h3>Bright Wind, Angry Shadows (Photography)</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Water</h3>
<p>— Li Wenxun</p>
<p>After being wrapped up in the mountainous regions of the Southwest for a long time, returning to the water-rich lands of Jiangnan is like returning from a barren military life to a garden filled with beauties. Here, life is vibrant, and everything seems abundant and radiant.</p>
<p>Water is beautiful; it is a flowing thought, possessing a graceful figure and a delightful voice.</p>
<p>Water is beautiful; it is a shimmering life, possessing colorful hues and boundless vistas.</p>
<p>A poet once said: Look, on the edge of the water and sky, a long, ancient beauty's sash...</p>
<p>Water gives us many flowery and jade-like dreams. A place without water is probably no different from a prison. Historically, no poet or thinker has ever disliked water; it gives them the inspiration of freedom. Shelley died in the water, Qu Yuan died in the water, Li Bai died in the water, and even the Narcissus boy in Greek mythology melted his beautiful life from the reflection of the water.</p>
<p>Through clear water, clean water, bright water, we see clouds, the morning sun, the evening glow, flowers, trees, and many, many landscapes in its all-encompassing flow.</p>
<p>Socrates said: As for us? We extract thoughts, language, and philosophy from the clouds; while water gives us many prosperous and colorful fantasies. I often stroll along the riverbank, sit on the rocks by the river, and think quietly; sometimes I sit there alone all day, as if in a delicate concert, a beautiful opera house, softly thinking of many loves, many dreams. The flowing water sings, from its lively flow, its affectionate flow; I seem to hear the pulse of my own life, and the surge of youthful blood. Sometimes I put my rough hands in its gentle flow, the water smiles and flows through the gaps in my fingers, with a slight itch, an equally comfortable tranquility, like a girl being caught and touched, at this time I clearly perceive the joy of a small life.</p>
<p>Water is beautiful, like an eternal music, my whole life is filled with this music. I loved water when I was very young, hugging and kissing the water in the shallow water between my mother's back, immersing myself in the water all day in the summer, being completely with the water, forgetting dinner, forgetting my mother's admonitions; even secretly thinking, one day let me wander with the water, no matter where and in what season, thinking of a city and island in the distance, maybe there is a pleasant festival and small dance.</p>
<p>I often stay with the people on those fishing boats, their lives make me feel mysterious, their wandering, their songs all make me intoxicated; from a young heart, an adventurous wandering has long been brewing. They tell me stories of water, I like to listen to the old fisherman's bitter experiences, like to see the healthy figure of the boat girl standing in the sunset and the water-like gentle smile.</p>
<p>But I am afraid to see the sea, the sea is elusive, moody, especially after I later read a Baudelaire's tragedy of a fisherman.</p>
<p>What I can never forget is the small night in Jiangnan, living in a winter village, waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the night, and then I can hear the quiet sound of the flowing water at the bottom of the small river, and the mournful turning of the waterwheel on the riverbank. That kind of sound makes me perceive the sadness of the bottom, like perceiving the sadness of life; until now, I have realized that the flow of the sadness of Tao is completely consistent with the desolate progress of life. It is also now that I understand why those wise men who are tired of survival want to use water as their eternal bed, even sleeping like children in a cradle, in the sound of mother-like flowing water, under the vast starry sky.</p>
<p>Water is beautiful, but it also contains a deep sorrow, like the tearful smile of a saint, shining in our sinful world. We can see many touching, silent tears everywhere, and many philosophers are willing to suffer in the world because of this kind of sparkle.</p>
<h3>Wind Fragments</h3>
<p>— Yang Lianyuan</p>
<p>All afternoon, I searched for the fragrance of flowers in the cold wind.</p>
<p>The path in the flower garden is still the same as last year, with pairs of beautiful feet wandering on the muddy road. Let's just say they are graceful figures, casting themselves slowly on the path due to the winter sun, which made me feel lost for a long time.</p>
<p>Young people, what are you thinking about? The flourishing flowers in the flower garden changed from yellow to red, and now yellow and white flowers are growing again; flowers bloom and wither, how can they make me think of anything? Thinking for a long time, why am I willing to be lonely? Why am I tormenting myself for trivial emotions?</p>
<p>In the cold wind, even flowers lose their reserve, letting the wind ravage them. Petals flutter around my feet, and the fragrance of flowers may no longer belong to me.</p>
<p>Kahlil Gibran said it well, "Can the days of separation become the days of reunion?" This is always a question mark, and now that I think about it, it depends on how we insist on our respective faithfulness in the days of separation.</p>
<p>Searching for the fragrance of flowers in that moment, only for her beauty, is also the best excuse for why I am willing to be lonely.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 136</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"At twenty-one hours, twenty-six minutes... the Secretariat of the General Staff Headquarters relays an urgent telephone call from Prime Minister Konoe from the Cabinet, ordering the 'Manchukuo' 'Chang Sheng' aircraft to cease its flight, and immediately return to its original airfield and await orders... furthermore: upon landing of the aircraft, the current Mainland Expeditionary Army Command, General Staff Headquarters Telecommunications Section, and Telecommunications Design Director, Lieutenant Colonel Tsurumi Tama, are to await further orders. This order. Duty Officer, Secretariat, Urgent."</p>
<p>Everyone passed on this telegram, and each person expressed their opinions on the message board:</p>
<p>"Just kidding, military intelligence is like 'fire.' Now it's like 'ice'."</p>
<p>"There must be a big event in this, otherwise, how could a troop movement order be withdrawn for such a minor personal matter?"</p>
<p>"A riddle! Even if a few of us make it to the mainland, we're bound to be killed in action. This omen symbolizes 'ill-fated journey'!"</p>
<p>At nine fifty-five, the "Chang Sheng" landed at the airfield. An officer on duty from the military headquarters was already there, ordering the captain of the "Chang Sheng" to seek instructions from the relevant departmental head regarding the resumption of flight, and ordering Tsurumi to report to the General Staff Headquarters Secretariat on duty immediately.</p>
<p>Tsurumi arrived at the secretariat, and after Tsurumi reported his rank and position, the duty officer immediately handed him a prepared document, told him to take the original car and rush to Beppu, saying that the Prime Minister had already called twice to inquire.</p>
<p>Tsurumi received this official document, and was speechless. He tried to maintain composure on his face, but his hands were covered in sweat. Why? Because he was going to see Konoe for the second time. The first time, Tsurumi was passive, and felt only a little uneasy. This second time, Konoe had turned the tables and become passive, and the situation was completely different; this would depend solely on his own dramatic acting skills. But one thing was a clear and undeniable fact: Konoe had been inexplicably led by the nose.</p>
<p>How do you say that? First, perhaps his intelligence specialists had reported to him about the short message in the second evening edition of the late newspaper. In his mind, he at least regarded it as the meddling of petty thieves, or enemy politicians playing a joke on him, but he could foresee that no one would be bold enough to come to his secret agency to cause trouble. In fact, it was simply impossible. Even if a few madmen did sneak in, a few guards or plainclothes detectives could arrest them in two seconds and lock them in a death row; even interrogation would be superfluous.</p>
<p>To put it more practically, perhaps he didn't even know about the short message at all; because from his position, he was in charge of national military plans, and how many special agency officials should he have under him? Surely there were plenty of people to handle such trivial matters? If even such a theatrical matter had to be reported to him for instructions, then wouldn't all of his subordinates, such as guards, plainclothes, special operatives, etc., be just eating and not doing anything?)</p>
<p>Assuming that he himself would not be concerned with such small matters, then who made the phone call to order the General Staff Headquarters Secretariat to send an urgent telegram to recall the "Chang Sheng"? Needless to say, it must have been Tsurumi's own people, creating the mystery.</p>
<p>However, Konoe was not a wooden man. Although he may not be considered a politician or military man of great talent and vision, it was not easy to have earned his current position, second only to one and above all others. He must have some tricks and knacks in his heart. Tsurumi could certainly use the various conveniences at his disposal, and a group of his subordinates, to create such a grand mystery. The only question was whether the person being manipulated could see through it. If he couldn't see through it, then the plan could naturally continue according to plan. But if he were to see through the scheme, wouldn't it be a hundred times worse? And it would be bad without end.</p>
<p>Before a violent storm breaks out, there must be a period of gloom; before a major earthquake, there must be a moment of silence; on the eve of a great war, there must be a period of terrible quiet; similarly, before Tsurumi's plan to search for the "Seven Secret Letters" was launched, there was also such a short period of silence. This short period of silence was between eight thirty and ten o'clock. In terms of actual action, it was from the time Tsurumi boarded the plane until he saw Konoe again. This was a terrifying period of silence, because during that short period of time, Tsurumi and his subordinates had lost contact.</p>

<h3>Mend the Roof Before the Mountain Rain Comes: A New Year's Ramble</h3>
<p>— Du Xin</p>
<p>In the fading year, bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, one can't help but feel sentimental, but even if everything is not as one wishes, one must still have new hope. Let's talk about what to do when "income and expenditure cannot be balanced."</p>
<p>The Secretary-General of the Finance Bureau reported on the city's financial situation at the municipal meeting, saying: "Income and expenditure cannot be balanced!"</p>
<p>Yes, today the entire Chinese financial situation is facing enormous difficulties, and there is a feeling of "being stretched to the limit." "Income and expenditure cannot be balanced" is especially true for general matters. It's not just Shanghai that is like this.</p>
<p>As for talking about achieving a state of balanced income and expenditure during times of financial constraints, it's not that there are no methods, there are some. That is "increasing revenue" and "reducing expenditure." However, the reason why the Secretary-General of the Finance Bureau said the phrase "cannot be balanced" is not because he doesn't understand the use of these two methods. On the contrary, it's because these two methods have been used too many times; on the one hand, the timing has been missed, and there is a feeling of "this road is not passable." On the other hand, it's also because this method is not the most appropriate method. For example, "levying new taxes to increase revenue" belongs to the category of "increasing revenue." But today's common people, as soon as they hear the word "tax," will think of "aspirin." Truly "old" to the extreme, how can it be "new"? If you insist on going your own way and insist on "taxing as you please," there is no doubt that you are violating "public opinion" and will arouse resentment among the people! As for "reducing expenditure," like "downsizing." However, there is also a "limit" to the use of this method, and it cannot be used repeatedly. "Downsizing" to a certain extent can no longer be "downsized," otherwise it will sharply reduce administrative efficiency! We can't say that in an organization, from the "bureau chief" to the "errand boy," one person should be in charge of everything, can we?</p>
<p>Then, is there really no win-win solution for China's finances today to achieve a state of balanced income and expenditure?</p>
<p>No, definitely not. There are methods, but I'm afraid that not implementing them thoroughly will ruin things. We know that if a house leaks, we must call a "plasterer" to "fix the leak," otherwise the house will leak even more severely! "A small hole not patched, a big hole suffers," this saying is not wrong at all. And the current China is a "ramshackle house" with "holes everywhere," which has not been repaired for many years, plus "wind" and "rain" attacks. If we don't find a way to "fix the leaks," just "catching water with a basin" or holding up an umbrella in the house to cover it up is not a long-term solution after all, and I'm afraid that sooner or later it will "collapse"!</p>
<p>Therefore, this third method should be a better method, and it is also a "feasible" method (as long as there is determination). Let's call this method "fixing leaks," shall we? "Dumping of foreign goods," "corruption of officials," "smuggling and tax evasion," "endless civil war"... these are all the "loopholes" in China today, and the biggest problems in financial constraints. If those "plasterers" on the political stage can find these "loopholes" and "repair" and "make up for" them one by one, then it will not be difficult for China's finances to reach a "balanced state"!</p>
<p>"Fixing leaks" seems to be a method that falls between "increasing revenue" and "reducing expenditure"; it also has the characteristics of both methods. What is feared is that it is easier said than done!</p>
<h3>Extremely Clever</h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>Once Arthur Conan Doyle (translator's note: i.e., the author of the famous Sherlock Holmes detective stories) was riding a streetcar back to his hotel in Paris. As he paid the driver, the latter said, "Thank you, Mr. Doyle."</p>
<p>"How did you know my name?" the author asked.</p>
<p>"I saw in the newspaper that you were arriving here today from the south of France," the driver explained. "Your whole appearance indicates that you are an Englishman. You had your hair cut once in the past week, and it is obvious that your hairstyle was done by a barber from the south of France."</p>
<p>"Amazing!" the creator of Sherlock Holmes praised. "Do you have any other evidence?"</p>
<p>"No," the driver replied, "except for the fact that your name is on your luggage."</p>
<p>Easing the Burden</p>
<p>A: "These past two days, prices have soared,</p>
<p>So I'm desperately trying to ease the burden."</p>
<p>B: "How do you ease it? I must ask for your advice."</p>
<p>A: "Yesterday I pawned my watch, and today I simply pawned my overcoat."</p>

<h3>Gu Chunfan as I Know Him</h3>
<p>— Ke Chang</p>
<p>Gu Chunfan, the second Director of Finance for Shanghai after the victory, is a learned and talented economist. However, Mr. Gu did not always work in the Ministry of Finance, but was a postal worker in the post office.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Gu Chunfan was only a Grade A postal clerk in the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau. He studied economics at university and usually liked to write. Young people are often dissatisfied with reality, and he was often dissatisfied with a superior surnamed Wang, but he could not dismiss Mr. Gu (because the personnel system of the post office at that time was excellent, and superiors could not dismiss their subordinates at will). Until soon after, Mr. Wang was ordered to transfer subordinates. Mr. Gu was the first to bear the brunt and was transferred to Nanyang County, Henan Province, to be the director of a small local post office. Nanyang is a barren and poor place, and life is of course difficult, but Mr. Gu could not resist the order of his superior, so he had to go to Nanyang to take office in depression.</p>
<p>While in Nanyang, there was relatively little work, and there was no place for leisure and entertainment, so he devoted himself to economic research. After three years of hard work, he wrote a book on the Chinese economy and translated it into English. After these tasks were completed, Mr. Gu was transferred back to the head office, and this book on the Chinese economy was published at this time.</p>
<p>As soon as this book came out, it was greatly appreciated by scholars, and superiors also looked at him with different eyes. In a few years, he was promoted several times. The English version sold well abroad, and foreigners believed that the author of this book was a remarkable economist.</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi went abroad to borrow money. At that time, the Americans already had an impression of Mr. Gu. As soon as Mr. Kong got off the plane, someone asked, "Is there a Mr. Gu here?" Mr. Kong had no idea who Mr. Gu was. Fortunately, an attendant replied, "Mr. Gu did not come with us." That's how he managed to get through it. Mr. Kong of course had to investigate who this Mr. Gu, who had made a great name for himself in the New World, was after the fact. After inquiring, he learned that he was the author of a book on the Chinese economy. After returning to China, he learned that Mr. Gu was working in the post office, so he intended to promote him and promoted Mr. Gu very quickly. In 1944, Mr. Gu participated in the International Monetary Conference because he was a currency expert.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the postal administration's achievements in taking over were praised by Chairman Chiang. Shanghai is an international city, and those who manage finance need to be honest and capable, so Mr. Gu, who was serving in the post office, was brought to the Ministry of Finance and ordered to be the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau.</p>
<h3>Bidding Farewell to the Old and Welcoming the New: Talking About Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>Firecrackers, also known as firecrackers or crackers, are said to have been invented by Ma Jun of the Wei Dynasty in the Three Kingdoms period. By the Sui and Tang Dynasties, they were modified into fireworks, which were one of the essential skills of variety shows. The use of gunpowder to make cannons as weapons began in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>The materials for making firecrackers are: thick grass paper, fine money, mud, clay, fuse, ignition money, and black powder. Black powder is a mixture of saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur.</p>
<p>Our country is good at making firecrackers, which are sold at home and abroad every year. In particular, sales to the Dutch East Indies and Malaya are the largest. Taking 1935 as an example, our country (including Hong Kong) imported 356,178 Dutch guilders of firecrackers to the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Because firecracker manufacturers in our country stick to old methods and do not think about improvements, the maximum bursting power of the soaring cannon cannot exceed 100 feet.</p>
<p>The principle of firecrackers making noise and rising is: when the fuse burns, it is transmitted to the gunpowder, causing an explosion, generating a large amount of gas that is rapidly discharged backward. The reaction of the force pushes the firecracker to shoot out in the opposite direction, and because the gunpowder explosion cracks the firmly sealed paper wall on all sides, it makes a sound.</p>

<h3>Riding a Donkey or Riding a Horse?</h3>
<p>— Moni</p>
<p>A few friends got together to chat, and once, they even talked about life issues. After chatting for most of the day, what was the conclusion? Most of my friends agree with our national essence, the so-called "doctrine of the mean." Friend A said that he had a ditty that could represent the Chinese philosophy of life, which is copied below:</p>
<p>"My predecessors rode horses, I ride a donkey, Thinking carefully, I am not as good, Looking back at the cart-pulling Han, Less than the front, but more than the rear."</p>
<p>If you want to ask, what if you have more than the "rear"? Of course, that friend riding the donkey calmly and triumphantly rode away.</p>
<p>In high school, I was interested in everything, had the highest ideals, and the greatest ambition. When you are in college, you are about to step into the social circle. After getting to know this society a little, you feel a little discouraged. Finally, after encountering a few nails and pouring a few buckets of cold water, you feel discouraged about everything. Fortunately, you have been poisoned by "contentment is always happiness," and after a few comparisons, you are satisfied again.</p>
<p>And the seriousness of the problem lies here.</p>
<p>If you don't move forward, just rest for a while and then move forward. It doesn't matter much. If you look back at the cart-pulling Han behind you, or even the porter: then everything is over, aren't there more people behind you who are not as good as you?</p>

<h3>Is It Manslaughter?</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>When Professor Howard Nay was hunting in the Rocky Mountains, someone informed him that a tragedy had occurred at a campsite. Thinking that he himself might be helpful in solving the case, he went to the scene of the incident. After introducing himself, Bradlow (a friend of the victim) told him about the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>"When Marshall hadn't returned by nine o'clock last night, I started to worry, because he wasn't familiar with the mountain paths here at all. There were no stars or moon in the sky, and it was very dark, so I decided to look for him. Because our campsite was stationed five miles farther than anyone else's, that's what you should know.</p>
<p>"After adding some wood to the campfire, I went out. After searching for about an hour, I came to the slope of the canyon and saw a pair of eyes staring at me in the dark, shining at me.</p>
<p>"I shouted twice, but there was no reply. I thought it was a mountain lion, so I fired. You can imagine how frightened I was when I approached the place and lit a match, I had smashed Marshall's head. It was such a terrible experience!</p>
<p>"I brought his body back to the camp, and then went to the nearest house to report this unfortunate accident."</p>
<p>"When you found Marshall, how far was he from your campsite?" Professor Howard Nay asked.</p>
<p>"About a quarter of a mile away?"</p>
<p>"Now I see that your right hand is bandaged. Which hand did you use to fire the gun?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I can shoot with both hands!"</p>
<p>"Can I see your gun?"</p>
<p>"Okay." Bradlow said, and handed over the gun.</p>
<p>"Hmm! European-made, have you had this gun for a long time? How long have you had it?"</p>
<p>"No, it can be said to be new." Professor Howard Nay said suddenly and sternly: "Why did you deliberately murder Marshall? Don't quibble, he was indeed deliberately murdered by you."</p>
<p>Clever readers, how did the professor know that Bradlow deliberately murdered his companion?</p>
