<h3>馬歇爾五度上廬山　離京前分別與俞周晤談對和平商談正謀新途徑</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使廿三日晨九時接見俞大維，十一時復接見周恩來，下午二時離京赴廬。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使廿三日下午六時半五上廬山，馬夫人往迎於小天池，聞馬使定廿四日晋謁主席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕司徒雷登大使，廿三日與外界接見甚少，十一時邵力子曾往訪，約談一小時，邵係轉達晨間參政會對和平之主張，下午司徒除會晤加大使歐德倫外，並召見　　工作人員。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕美使館人員廿三日吿記者，馬帥，司使目前調處工作，仍摸索國共雙方意見距離之點，邇來循環接見結果，國共意見與六月廿九日以前完全相同，雖雙方均表示願政治解決，惟迄未見作新的讓步，政協決議，整軍方案，恢復交通三問題，爲交換意見主要範圍。交通分歧之點尙較小，國共間主要不能接近之處，仍係共軍駐地及地方行政權兩點，政府方面認爲，過去對駐地問題未提五點意見，無再退讓理由，共產黨仍表示不能接近。故馬　司正謀覓一調處新途徑。問題集結點，未能澈底明瞭，則不擬提出任何新方案，馬帥已飛牯　主席，以共產黨意見轉達，並徵詢蔣主席意見，日內可返。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使離京前，曾舉行重要會談兩次，第一次係於　　九時半與交長俞大維會談，至十時半始畢，討論主題爲依照國共雙方所簽訂之協定恢復交通問題。第二次係於中午十一時，與中共代表周恩來會談，至十二時半始畢。據中共方面人士所知：談話內容涉及「當前局勢」，各該人士稱：馬使此次赴牯嶺，已爲第五次，或即爲最後一次，亦未可必，但此非談判決裂之謂。</p>
<h3>加使歐德倫談話　晋謁主席僅係普通酬酢否認馬帥請其參預商談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕加拿大駐華大使歐德倫少將，廿三日於使館接見本報記者時，對外國通訊社所傳馬帥曾托其向蔣主席解釋，以打開目前談判僵局一說，堅決予以否認。氏以軍人外交家之爽直口吻稱：余在牯嶺時，曾數度謁蔣主席，返京後亦曾與馬帥晤及，但此僅爲普通酬酢性質，過於平常，一若余目前與君（指記者）談話之不足奇，絕不能因此遽認余將出而參預和平談判，言下，對此事似不滿。記者五時半至美使館訪問時，則又見歐德倫大使於五時三刻驅車到達，記者六時半離去時，猶未見其辭出，想正仍與司徒雷登大使作其「酬酢性」之談話中。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會昨舉行談話會</h3>
<p>將發宣言呼籲和平</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕參政會駐委會廿三日晨九時舉行臨時會，因不足法定人數，改開談話會，會議主要議題，爲范予遂、尹述賢、武肇煦、伍純武等七參政員所提呼籲和平恢復商談，以實現和平統一提案，由武肇煦等說明，盼軍事衝突能立即停止，關於軍隊整編統編，盼共軍能遵照整軍方案辦理。關於擴大政府機構，召開國大等，盼能遵照政協決議，如有困難，希望能尊重馬帥、司使等第三者意見，並提議勸毛澤東停止動員。因尙有若干參政員，亦　　　　　　　　　籲，故定廿四日午後，再　　　會議，起草宣言，並定卅日集會，通過後發表。會中對政府此次調整匯率，亦曾加以討論，各參政員咸盼政府能設法防止物價隨滙率調整而上漲。會議共歷兩小時三刻鐘。</p>
<p>邵力子贊同速開憲草會</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕記者廿三日午訪　　　長　　　　牯嶺所傳張君　　　　　　　　開憲草審議會之意見，邵氏稱：「就余個人看法，憲草審議會亦應早開」。記者繼詢以外傳參政會定雙十節開會一說，是否確實，邵氏稱：「有人曾作此建議，或亦可能」。對廬山談話事，邵認若眞舉行，不能稱爲「談話會」，以其將無形式，且不致作任何決議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕參政員伍純武語記者，在國大召開前，參政會確有再舉行一次會議必要，至是否將於雙十節召開，則尙未定。</p>
<p>在滬參政員請召開大會</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕在滬參政員江庸、褚輔成、曾琦、黃炎培、錢永銘、江恒源、左舜生、潘運茹、章士釗、常乃悳、潘昌猷、羅衡、李荐廷、胡健中、周　冲、陶玄、陳霆銳、張冀樞、江　平、陶百川、陳啓天、端木愷、奚倫、吳蘊初、鄧華民、張潛華、王冠英、譚光、陳銘德、王德興、王維新、吳望伋、葉溯中、朱惠清等，以國府明令本屆參政會任期延至本年十月底，爲檢討時局，特於昨日下午六時，在駐滬參政員聯誼社開會，決議聯名電呈蔣主席，請從速召開四屆第三次大會，俾得聽取大政報吿，共圖挽救解決之方。</p>

<h3>彭部長校正外記者紀載</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十三日電〕記者頃訪彭部長學沛，承吿二十一日外記者招待會中聯合社記者所記當日本人談話內容與當時原意不盡相符，茲可擇較重要數點校正如下：記者問，中共下令動員，其意義如何，余答，共產黨部隊正規軍幷不甚多，所謂土共較多，茲所謂動員者，不過驅迫更多農民參加土共軍而已。外記者問，政府對於中共動員令是否重視，余答，亦不能忽視。問，動員令是否即係宣戰，余答宣戰名詞不適用，余意蓋謂一黨不能向政府宣戰也。問，何時改組政府，擴大基礎，答，行政院已有農林，經濟，交通三部長爲非國民黨員，此種擴大，隨時可以繼續進行。問，政府不即改組，是否因蔣主席所提條件中共未能接受，答，所謂條件多係政協決議或雙方所簽之協定，只督促實行而已，不過因爲中共在東北，山東，蘇北擴張地盤，以致局勢改變，故條件內容亦須適應此情形。至於主要爭執，在由中共或由政府統治蘇北各縣一語，則完全爲聯合社記者自己之猜想。問，政府是否贊成蘇北在各國監視下公民投票，答，未聞此種奇特建議，但如在中共統治下，斷無投票自由。問，政治協商會議是否已死亡，余答，無死活問題，余意蓋謂死活　之甚不確切，此種問題頗爲複雜，不能以死活字樣槪括，總之中共最近提出全國動員，展開攻勢等名詞，大聲疾呼，對政府儼如敵國，驅迫數十萬不識毫無軍事訓練之老百姓，盲目跑上戰場，而其所謂攻勢粉碎之對象，又爲抗戰八載，保國衛民之國軍。吾人目睹仳情此景，能不痛惜，政府守土衛民有責，又不能將各地及中央政權拱手讓於少數派之中共，此決非國人之意向，深望中共迅速遵照主席八一四宣示，退出若干構成和平威脅與阻礙交通之地區，收回其所謂動員攻勢，以免生靈涂炭。政府之於人民，猶家長之於家人，雖有時對少數偶加譴責，或奮去其手中舞弄之刀槍，目的仍爲維護全家之福祉，和平統一，無時不在政府渴望之中也。</p>
<h3>廬山夏令營結業典禮　蔣主席親致訓詞　勉學員負起革命使命成爲國父最忠實信徒</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿三日電〕廬山夏令營，廿三日晨十時在傳習學舍大禮堂舉行結業典禮，蔣主席以兼團長地位親臨主持，領導行禮後，即席致訓，以力行及研究學術方法二事相勉歷時四十分鐘始畢。禮成後返行轅休息，正午復來營，與全體官員聚餐，當主席進出食堂時，歡呼響徹山谷。廿三日戴傳賢，周鍾　，何浩若，柳克述均以來賓或講師資格被邀到營觀禮。所有營中未當選青年團二全大會代表學員，廿三日下廬山賦歸。</p>
<p>〔又電〕將主席廿三晨十時在廬山夏令營結業典禮致訓詞，首謂夏令營各學員應人人自勉，爲國父最忠實之信徒，負起完成國民革命所加的使命。我們革命的歷史如此悠久，三民主義如此偉大，爲什麼到了今天，我們的主義還沒有實現，革命還沒有成功，國父救國建國的願望還沒有達成呢，唯一的原因就是我們繼起的同志不能力行。現在抗戰雖已勝利，而建設的工作還不能積極進行，國事艱難，社會凋敝，同胞的痛苦還未解除，這些都是我們共同的恥辱，應該刻骨銘心引爲已任。今後革命建國的成敗，完全要看我們力行的精神如何，大家如能認清責任，每一件工作實事求是，篤實踐履對於自己所宣讓的誓詞，所信奉的主義，均能信守不渝，力行貫徹，則革命的成功毫無疑問。主席繼指各學員爲提高力行的效率，大家必須養成科學的精神，學習科學的辦事順序。所謂科學的精神，就是要實事求是，精益求精，科學的辦事順序就是要分別輕重緩急，本末先後，而因事制宜，把握重點，切實努力，而其基本的工夫，尤在於精心分析和研究。任何問題如能窮研精討，則必能發現其中的精理，而得到圓滿的解決。革命黨員要服務社會效忠國家，尤必須根據科學的原理，原則來判斷事理，解決問題，纔能以簡馭繁，發揮事半功倍的成效。夏令營所給予你們的訓練，不僅在鍜鍊你們的身心，培養良好的生活習慣，而最主要的是要你們力行主義，尤其對於工作方法，有切實的認識，救國建國，盼大家一致負起這個神聖的使命。十二時主席參加全體師生聚餐會，又於熱烈掌聲中起立致訓。略謂：革命黨員必須有民胞物與的襟懷以已飢已溺之心爲社會民衆勤勞服務。社會上如有一人沒有飯吃，沒有衣穿，男女老幼如有一人不得其所，就是我們革命黨的責任未盡，黨員的努力不够，就應該受人家指摘受人家的批評。所以我們革命黨員無所謂權利，而只知有義務，無所謂享受，而只知有犧牲。我們必須勤勞努力，爲民衆服務，來解除人民的痛苦，增進人民的福利，然後纔不愧爲國父的信徒。」</p>

<h3>禇逆民誼在蘇槍決　遺言盼望政府敎育其子女　願將遺體送博習醫院解剖</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕僞府外交部長，駐日大使，廣東省長，褚逆民　，已於廿三日晨，在蘇州獅子口第三監獄內刑塲，執行槍決，此一代禍國巨奸，雖經其家屬屢次聲請再審，終未能貸其一死，而在森嚴法律之下伏法矣，時年已六十有四歲。本報駐蘇記者事先得訊，破曉即馳赴刑塲，作壁上觀。茲分誌詳情如後：</p>
<p>監刑法官臨時改派</p>
<p>上午六時許，京滬蘇錫各報記者雲集第三監獄者，達三十餘人。迨七時四十五分，蘇高檢處臨時改派檢察官梁挹清爲監刑官，偕書記官王學　，率法警六名，乘汽車駛抵，由典獄長陳松年迎入稍息。至八時正，在獄內敎誨堂佈設臨時法堂，梁檢察官偕陳典獄長，王書記官升座，命法警至禮字監二號囚室簽提褚逆。時褚逆洗　正畢，靜默　坐牀上，見狀知末日已臨，央法警赴女監轉告陳逆　君。陳逆聞訊失色，急囑法警少待，隨即書一便條呈梁檢察官，內云：「昨奉院方裁定駁回，今晨抗吿已送出」，用意當係制止執行，梁檢察官遂以電話向韓首席請示，奉諭：「不停止執行」。即傳令命復提，褚逆始知實已不能挽回，遂週身換穿新衣，計深灰毛質單長衫，白底細青條府綢短衫褲，黑色絲襪，黑緞鞋，左手堂佛珠一串，至女監門口與陳　君握手道「再會」。陳逆以手絹掩面飲泣，未作一言。</p>
<p>刑前留影强作歡笑</p>
<p>褚逆遂於法警簇擁下漫步至臨時法庭，當行經陪弄時，各報攝影記者紛紛攝取鏡頭，褚逆尙强作笑顏，站定姿勢而言：「最後一次了，拍得好些」。八時十五分，褚逆踏進臨時法堂，雖强作鎭定，而面色蒼白，襯以禿頂長髯，備覺可佈，未向庭上行禮，傲然立公案前，可見褚逆內心旣悵且恨，正綿綿無已也。梁檢察官首詢年籍，褚逆朗聲應答，　異常時，心臟跌動之息，清晰可聞。復詢有無遺囑，始答「沒有遺言」，繼則稱。</p>
<p>自稱有病願供剖研</p>
<p>「我生死俱極坦然，生固無所慚愧，死則須有價值。希望能將我遺體送天賜莊博習醫院解剖，因我外表雖極壯健，而內部實有病症，愿供醫學家研究，俾製成標本，作我死後貢獻」。復謂：「我十七歲時曾在博習醫院學習一年，故極有關係，當能收我遺體，不致拒絕」，言下頗無倫次。梁檢察官續訊家屬地址，答稱：「雖時當有人來接見，然不知現居何處，南京本有住宅，惟早已遷移」。再訊「有無遺言」？褚逆略作沉思，少頃而答：「對家屬沒有遺囑，惟我有一婿二女三子，希望政府能爲我敎育子女，至於所判沒收財產一節，實則我的財產極可憐，政府旣有酌留家屬生活費的規定，希望可以留得寬裕一點，以免我妻晚年還要奔走衣食。」梁檢官諭以「你子女敎育，政府自必負責，你還有什麼話要說嗎」？褚逆搖首示意，梁檢察官即諭令退庭，命法警將褚逆押赴刑塲。行經監舍時，囚犯均探首外窺，褚逆頻頻舉手招呼曰：「我先去了」。</p>
<p>一槍斃命家屬來遲</p>
<p>迨　擁進刑塲，褚逆甫步至左前側　塲旁，執行警周九成即乘其不備，自後發槍，一彈命中腦壳，自鼻樑右側射出，褚逆應聲撲倒，詎尙未着地，即縱身仰臥，頭東北，脚西南，雙手握拳屈舉兩肩傍，眼微張，血流滿面。經吳地檢處派檢騐吏王椿榮蒞塲檢騐。梁檢察官始返院復命。又悉：褚妻陳舜貞已於二十二日晚車偕子叔齊由京抵蘇，當夜住中國飯店二〇八號，廿三日晨聞悉報載，迨其　子及女孟媛，曁親戚金培元趕赴第三監獄，已屆九時一刻，褚逆業伏法一小時許矣。褚妻身穿玄色香雲紗旗袍。褚女則月白色布旗袍，兩人均戴黑太陽眼鏡，穿白皮鞋，褚子年僅十五歲，穿白香港衫，灰色短褲，黃皮鞋，入休息室後，母女泣不成聲，狀　悽慘。子則呆坐一旁，毫無表情，由其戚金培元辦妥領屍手續，褚逆遺體即　送仁濟局蘇州殯儀分館，今日午後已予大殮。</p>
<p>褚逆屍體今日大殮</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕褚逆屍體十一時廿分移抵殯儀館後，首由其妻以毛巾拭淨面部血跡，其女孟媛則頻頻輕吻父頰，悲不能仰，後即由工役爲換屍衣，計綱扣紡短衣褲，什錦縐棉襖褲，縐紗長夾衫，灰色素縐棉袍，玄色毛葛馬褂，玄緞帽，紅帽結，水色襪，玄緞鞋，並於項頸另加佛珠一串，飾終之具係楠木棺材，據聞尙係廿八年份以法幣一百餘元所購得者，臨時裝置天花板，內盛　花被褥，素綢灰衾，　花　衾，陀羅彌錦被。靈堂佈置頗簡單，有基督敎張　齡牧師致送之十字花架一座。茲悉：今日因須待居滬之戚屬奔喪，故不大殮，然天氣炎熱，至　於廿四日必須收殮矣。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>由美南關係看世界大局</h3>
<p>在韃靼尼爾海峽問題被蘇聯提出，引起了地中海東部局勢的動盪以後，在巴黎和會進了第四周而尙一無成議之際，中歐的局勢，又因美國與南斯拉夫間關係的惡化而呈着緊張。到了最近，美南兩國間劍拔弩張的關係，終於迫使美國不得不於廿二日向南斯拉夫提出最後通牒，限於四十八小時內要求南斯拉夫政府釋放被扣的美飛行員。英政府表面上置身事外，實際上則同情美國，如南國總統蒂託不改採妥協態度，英美勢將一致行動。而美國會議員且有主張壓迫蒂託辭職者。雖南國於接獲此最後通牒前一小時釋放美機員，但究竟因了這哀的美敦書的一度提出，使動盪不安的歐洲局勢更增其動盪。火種處處，稍一不愼，隨處可以燎原，的確，自納粹崩潰以來的一年間，歐洲局勢的危機四伏，實在沒有再比今日更爲嚴重的了！</p>
<p>此次美國與南斯拉夫間關係之惡化，其直接的原因，要由於八月九日南斯拉夫戰鬥機襲擊因天氣惡劣而被迫飛越南國領空之美軍載客飛機一架，機中所載人客均被南斯拉夫當局扣留。美國駐南斯拉夫大使先曾奉國務院電令，向南政府提出照會，但南政府之覆牒，表面雖屬溫和，實際却極强硬，對於美國要求置之不理，因而迫使美政府提出其最後通牒，限期釋放全部被扣人員，送至邊境，否則美國「將請聯合國安全理事會立即開會，採取適當措置」。美機被南斯拉夫飛機襲擊，致被迫降落南境，近來屢有所聞，據報傳消息，最近一月來前後已發生三次之多。此項飛機襲擊事件之一再發生，而迄無滿意處置，自易引起兩國間關係之惡化。在這些美機被擊事件以外，駐防特里埃斯特港美軍又曾被南軍射擊。故近來美國與南斯拉夫間的關係，一直在緊張狀態中。此次哀的美敦書的提出，實是兩國關係惡化累積的結果。</p>
<p>據報傳消息，此次美國向南斯拉夫所提最後通牒，措詞嚴厲，爲珍珠港事件以來所罕見，全文充滿憤慨。又據南斯拉夫發言人稱，蒂托元帥可能拒絕美國通牒中之要求，究竟如何答復，在記者執筆時，其復牒措詞尙不可知。但就南國業已釋放被扣多日的美機人員看來，似乎南國態度業又軟化，大局未始不可好轉。假使僵局未能打開，而美國果請聯合國安全理事會立即開會，對此事採取適當措置，則我們又將設想到聯合國安全理事會的召開，否決權的利用，究竟對於這一事件能否爲適當的措置？這無疑的將成爲聯合國組織是否具有權力的最有意義的試探。</p>
<p>從美南關係的嚴重局面，我們應該可以窺見世局演變之一斑。因爲以南斯拉夫這樣一個經濟落後的國家，而一再有刺激美國事件的發生，誰也知道這裏面具有國際的背景。倘使沒實一個頑强的力量作她的支持，南斯拉夫決不會如此不量力的。而支持南斯拉夫的，誰也知道是目前稱覇的緊張，决不完全是美國與南斯拉夫間的事件，露骨言之，實是美國與蘇聯間勢力的角逐。倘使是一宗單純的南斯拉夫的事件，以美國這樣的氣度，也決不致出以如此嚴厲的手段。南斯拉夫在戰後原不過是一種工具。操縱而使用之者，原本另有其人。這宗事件的發生，深一層看，與韃靼尼爾海峽問題，伊朗問題，處分義大利問題，及其它出現在各處的事件，都息息相關。在蘇聯方面，南國的行動，或許就是她對於美國反應態度的試探；而在美國，則提出最後通牒以後，也想把南國的反應作爲蘇聯態度的試探。故南斯拉夫事件的如何處理，如何演變，以及如何了局，與其它問題都有甚深的關聯，這一問題而能處理得當，自然旁的問題也易於就範。換言之，南斯拉夫的態度是否轉爲緩和而不如前之倔強，與蘇聯的態度有關。此後國際局勢如何演化，繫於美南關係的如何發展者固不少，而繫於蘇聯之是否在國際政治舞台上一意孤行，尤爲癥結所在。</p>
<p>於此，使我們不能不想起南斯拉夫局勢之發展到現階段，盟國當局實應負相當責任。南斯拉夫對於軸心軍隊的入侵，曾有英烈的抵抗，在反軸心戰事的早期，確有光榮的一頁。等到國都被占，政府流亡，南斯拉夫人民亦曾不斷有所奮鬥。而蒂托之流，在南斯拉夫本爲少數，共黨一貫的作風，是以少數壓迫多數，又復運用其宣傳戰術，博取國外同情。今日蒂托在南斯拉夫的統治，半亦由盟國當年對南斯拉夫沒有堅定遠見的政策所造成。美國議員們到今天纔有蒂托必須辭職的憤語，可惜爲時已晚。我們鑒於過去盟國對南斯拉夫沒有堅定的政策，致造成今日的結果，不知道此後盟國是否還想到處用綏靖政策，再種下將來破壞和平的禍根？在我們今天看世界大局，則以爲民主與極權是無可兩立的力量，民主國家對於極權國家，無論如何求妥協，世界和平還是可望而不可即的。世界和平的維繫，不能以對暴力施行綏靖政策來獲致的！</p>

<p>〔聯合社貝格勒電〕被扣之十人中其中九人己於廿二日獲釋，恰在美國駐南斯拉夫大使柏德遜向蒂托總理提出最後通牒前一小時。被釋放之九人，當由美國駐柴格拉勃總領事陪同，於廿二日下午一時牛左右離開拘留地之吉布耶那。查美國最後通牒中所抗議被擊落之美機，共有兩架。一架為本月九日被擊落者，其被扣人員玆悉業已釋放，但尚有第二架，即本月十九日被南斯拉夫戰鬥機擊落者，其下落若何，尚未分明，據南斯拉夫電台廿二日廣播，第二架被擊落美機人員，係用降落傘自空中躍下，故無法尋獲，可能已墜地身死，無一生存云，如此，則第二架美機中人員之釋放問題，仍不解决，蒂托總理之拒絕美方最後通牒，當亦係表示南斯拉夫對於第二架墜落之美機，並不知其下落，自未能負任何責住。美國方面對此事正作十分緊張之準備，以便限期滿後南斯拉夫對最後通牒之正式答覆未能使美國滿意時，即行採取適當之措置。</p>
<p>按此訊傳出以前，廿三日一般跡象，似頗有緩和之望。最後通牒發出後，美駐南大使柏德遜即曾專機飛往蒂托總理避暑地之勃萊特，親與蒂托談判，據合眾社具格勒電，廿三日柏德遜告報界稱，「南斯拉夫政府巳允給予完全滿意之答覆」，並悉蒂托曾鶩類保證，此類事件决不致再度發生，且美國代表必可獲得一切協助與便利，前往調查被擊落飛機之情形。復據聯合社消息，蒂托總理廿二日曾以書面答復聯合社及紐約時報記者二人之詢問，聲明已「嚴令」南斯拉夫第四軍司令後不得再射擊外國「軍用或民用」飛機。兩記者之詢問係請美大使柏德遜轉致者。</p>
<h3>和會人士注視南斯拉夫事件　莫洛托夫與南副揆會談　巴爾幹可能再成為歐洲火藥庫</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕由於南斯拉夫與美國之爭執，於廿三日午夜前尚不能獲得决定之故，審核義大利和約草案之工作，勢必大受妨礙。美代表團對最後通牒問題，廿二日夜並未發表任何評論，僅康納利與貝爾納斯會晤後宣稱，戰時南斯拉夫為我國之盟友，吾人在和平時代亦欲與其保持同樣關係，擊落我國飛行員一事，殊令人失望，其後果僅足損害國際局勢而已。又據合眾社電莫洛托夫廿二日與南斯拉夫訓副總理卡德利會談四十分鐘，所談或系關於美國致南斯拉夫最後通牒事。莫洛托夫與卡氏係在盧森堡宮前房中談話，同時烏克蘭外長曼紐爾斯基警告諸代表謂，「巴爾幹可能再度成為歐洲之火藥庫」。曼紐爾斯基譴責關於巴爾幹諸國所謂貪婪之政策稱，「此對於國際關係顯有惡毒之影響」。</p>
<h3>義大利總理作日返羅馬</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿二電〕義大利內閣總理加斯貝利，頃自巴黎長用途電話通知內閣，於本月廿四日午前十時舉行會議，並謂余將於明日返抵羅馬。</p>
<h3>參加日賠償會蘇提先决條件</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕美政府柬邀各關係國參加日本賠償會議，限本月十五日以前答覆，遠東委員會十一國中除蘇聯外，均已答復，表示贊同·蘇聯態度尚未表明。據可靠人士所知，蘇聯政府已非正式表示準備參加賠償會議，但提出若干先决條件，此類條件正由其他各國考慮中。按日本賠償會議定本年九月初舉行。</p>
<h3>對巴黎和會艱重工作我極願有所貢獻　與法澳等國結成集團為義爭取有利的和平</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據法國新聞社：巴黎電，和會中國代表團廿二日發表正式聲明稱：巴黎和會與中國國家利益雖非直接有關，但中國代表團對於和會之工作，寄以極大關切。本代表團將努力貢獻於一切重大問題之公平解决，蓋以巴黎和會之談判及其所懷精神，將成為另一會議之先例，日本之命運即在該一會議中决定。和會下次舉行全體大會之日期，將由祕書長杜巴克决定，惟對義政治及領土委員會，則定於廿三日下午三時舉行。各委會於廿三日晨均不開會，推原其故，乃因各國代表對於和約草案提出修正案甚多，且在提出討論前，均須譯成英法俄三國文字，手續殊繁。據合眾社消息：蘇</p>
<p>本報收聽巴黎廣播：對義政治及領土委員會廿三日開會，通過對義和約序文之第一節。和會廿一個會員國除挪威外，均將在對義和約上簽字。南斯拉夫原曾提議將阿爾巴尼亞包括在內，後將此項提議收回，而使序文第一節獲得通過。惟在討論第二節措辭時，即遭遇困難，美代表康納利廿三日第一次參加會議。又據聯合社訊：中國法國澳大利及加拿大等國，現己結成集團，為義大利爭取更溫和之和平，預料和會對義政治及領土委員會廿三日會議時，該集團各國將說明其新的立場，贊成堅主對義和約草案應予寬大，因義國曾於推翻墨索里尼後，協助聯合國作戰。</p>
<p>據聯合社訊，伊朗代表團一行三人，已於二十二日自德黑蘭啟程飛往巴黎，參加和會。蘇聯代衣團方面對外傳莫洛托夫已致電聯合國秘書長賴依，要求聯合國大會延期開會一節，加以否認。英美方面認為聯台國大會議程上重要節目多，不應予以延期，但巴黎和會之工作，亦不應使其中斷，故各代表中同意和會部份休會者，為數日增。</p>
<h3>南國對特港問題提出修正案</h3>
<p>本報收聽巴黎廣播：南斯拉夫所提對特港問題之修正方案約如下述：行政機構之任務，在議定該港管理規則，編造預算，釐定稅收等，並任免特港行政長官，次官暨港務等各項事宜。行政長官負責統治特港，各級辦公處，並指導其財政上政策，由上述行政機構授予全權處理一切。該港管理規則一節應作為對義和約之一部份。至有關特里埃斯特自由區之處置，南斯拉夫認為係該國與自由城間之協議，如無雙方之同意，不得修改。南斯拉夫對有關對義和約之參政事，認為特里埃斯特自由領土將僅減至城區為限。現該地尚處軍事當局治理之下，南國主張採取臨時政府辦法，在和約生效後一個月，軍政府應即在自由領土內取樂之。此時即應由美蘇英法組織國際委員會其後議會選出前，行使有關職權。四國應合組軍隊四團，每團一千人，每國分派一團，以維持治安秩序，此項軍隊並應置於統一指揮之下，在議會選出後一月撤退。行政權歸諸國際委員會任命之臨時政府委會。臨時政府委會由委員六人組成之，義方四人，南方二人，此項臨委會應另組臨時議會，委員六十人，內義方四十人，南方二十人。</p>
<h3>印度臨時政府今日可成立新德里正嚴事戒備　兩教徒有再度衝突可能</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕印度臨時政府之籌備，大體已就緒，據倫敦廣播：廿四日可宜告成立。據法國新聞社新德里電，印度國大黨主席尼赫魯等訪晤總督魏菲爾，對臨時政府組織事宜作最後之研商。臨時政府之閣員名單，已由尼赫魯於二十一日晨提交總督，但仍可更動，並非是後性質。內閣閣員共十五人，其中有二席屬於回教聯盟，虛位以待，俾使回聯得隨時參加臨時政府。尼赫魯在就任內閣總理之前，擬辭去國民大會黨主席一職，大抵臨時政府可於九月初成立，制憲會議則定於九月十五日開幕。印度英軍總司令歐，慶萊克將軍，前返國述職，現在英國，茲因尼赫魯所組織之臨時政府即將成立，故擬提前遄返任所，預料本月內即可返抵此間。</p>
<p>在此臨時政府即將成立之前夕，印回民族間之衝突，並未稍見緩和。加爾各答連續四日之大騷亂甫告平服，而新穗里刻又已面臨流血之危機，新德里一般人士預料，回教從與印教徒，近日可能發生衝突，因九月為回教徒之「拉瑪覃」節，向例舉行禁食及祈禱，本年業將宗教儀式改為政治集會，局勢頓見緊張，深恐回教徒繼加爾各答事件之後，再發生嚴重騷動。回教報紙載稱，加爾各答事件，回教徒所受損失四倍於印度教徒，多數回教教徒之意見，認為「直接行動日」所造成之騷動，不僅為要求「巴基斯坦」（即印回分治）之聖戰第一仗，且為必需立即報復之慘敗，故在此古城中已深惑不安。警察已奉命出去，探取一切必要防衛措置，以免發生事端。二十二日傍晚即派隊開始巡邏市街各要衝點，警察均暫行雙崗。據可靠消息稱，回教徒並不隱藏其急圖報復之熱情，及其將於一二日內肇事之希望，反之，印度教徒多願避免衝突，但如受襲擊决予反攻。</p>
<h3>阿聯盟附條件參加倫敦會議</h3>
<p>要求承認赫賽尼為回教出席代表</p>
<p>〔聯合社亞歷山大廿二日電〕阿拉柏同盟七國今日向英政府提出照會，要求承認耶路撒冷前回教主赫賽尼為巴勒斯坦回教徒代表之一，調該回教主為巴勒斯坦必不可少之人物，承認其領導權極為重要。同時一部份阿刺伯領袖預料阿刺伯同盟下次會議時，將推舉赫賽尼為巴勒斯坦阿拉伯執委會主席，並將派員與英政府商議此事，其他條件則因猶太人無權討論巴勒斯坦問題，故阿拉伯人不欲與猶太人同時出席會議。此外，應將阿拉伯人之權利及利益，作為此項談判之基本，而不應以委任統治問題或貝爾福宣言（關於巴勒斯坦猶太人前途之宣言）作為談判基礎。</p>
<h3>伊朗否認請美調處英蘇爭議英伊油區發生小衝突</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭廿二日電〕外傳伊朗總理沙丹納要求美國大蘇亞倫出面干涉英兩國爭議事，此說頃由此間電台予以否認。並謂伊朗內閣所採取之政策，係基於外國不得干涉伊朗內政一項原則。</p>
<p>〔合眾社德黑蘭廿二日電〕可齊斯坦以北之　海區域，即英伊油田區域內，今日發生小衝突數起。中央政府發起搜集伊朗北部「非法軍器」之運動，同時總理沙丹納將宵禁延長一小時，「以防範亂民之煽動滋事」。</p>
<h3>保待領土主權完整土耳其具有决心　斷然拒絕蘇無理要求英否認調兵伊土邊境</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕土京電台述該國烏魯斯報之言稱：吾人不願戰爭，但亦决定堅决拒絕無理之要求。戰爭時期吾人有功於盟國，戰爭結束後，吾人亦當防止和平之威脅。吾人願支持聯合國機構，但先决條件則為保持我領土之完整。</p>
<p>〔聯合社安加拉廿二日電〕蘇聯提議共管韃靼尼爾海峽一事，土耳其已於今日絕不猶豫報一「否」字。土耳其覆文措辭，頗具外交禮貌，但甚堅决，明告蘇聯，謂土耳其單獨足以管理此重要海峽，如欲有所變更，必須按照蒙德婁條約之規定辦埋。據土耳其政府發言人稱，美國干涉已除去蘇聯對土耳其之威脅。我人閉目接受美國之一切建議，我人完全信任美國及其政治觀念。一般印象，全部海峽問題已逐漸使土耳其卸去仔肩，而成為英美對蘇問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕陸軍都發言人今日宣稱：莫斯科電台廣播英軍向土耳其伊拉克邊界移動之說，全屬子虛。該電台引　叙利亞報紙消息，預料伊拉克境內將開到更多英軍，一部份集中於伊拉克土耳其邊界。據貝魯特某報伊拉克電，巴斯拉將績有英印軍隊開到，準備調往伊拉克土耳其邊界。又據自伊拉克邊境至貝魯特之叙利亞人稱，英印軍隊方集中於伊土邊界。</p>
<h3>希南交惡　外交關係不絕如縷</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿二日電〕「紐約時報」訪員稱：希臘政府自南斯拉夫撤回其大使後，現正在研究亦將駐南國大使召回一項問題。一般人士對南斯拉夫之舉動，殆為斷絕外交關係一點，紛作推測。據多數人之觀感，皆謂南國此舉，乃為對巴爾幹神經戰之一部份行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿二日電〕英駐希大使館今夜宣稱，南斯拉夫輪船「亞歷山大一世」號擱淺後，已為英機作為目標練習，加以炸毀。南斯拉夫已就此事，照會希臘外交部。</p>
<h3>蘇在德造武器三强要求調查</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林廿二日合眾電〕德境美軍政府高級人士今日謂：美英法可能再度提出調查四佔領區之完全解除軍備之要求，此係英國正式控指蘇聯繼續於其德國佔領區內製造武器之結果，英國之控告，使一般人憶起德人流傳之謠言，即蘇佔領區內，仍有兵工廠在以高速度工作，（此謠傳久被認為僅係日人之流言而被忽視）同時尚有與英方報道相仿之消息謂：蘇聯於德國製造軍器，且此事之發生，已有相當時日。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕外交部發言人稱：蘇聯在德國境內製造軍火之報告，一再傳出後，預料將採取若干行動，但該發言人不願透露行動之性質如何。</p>
<h3>軍事參謀團草擬世界警衛軍方案　會議絕對秘密內容無法深悉</h3>
<p>〔中央駐紐約廿三日專電〕聯合國軍事參謀團刻賡續舉行秘密會議，以草擬世界警衛軍之方案，但其進展如何，迄未有所聞。此蓋由於所有軍事參謀團代表均同意鑒於此工作之微妙性，故應守秘密。是以我軍事代表團首席代表何應欽於接見中央社記者時，亦拒絕討論軍事參謀團之工作。何氏稱。「此為吾人之莊嚴誓言，無論何種有關軍事參謀團之消息，最好由該團之秘書處理也。」據聞最近曾有一代表，廣播中述及軍事參謀團之工作進展情形，另有一代表聞訊後，提出强烈抗議，此後團內每一代表均守口如瓶。</p>

<h3>溥儀在國際法庭續提供證辭</h3>
<p>竟謂蘇對東北無野心</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日專電〕溥儀今晨在遠東國際法庭作證時，謂蘇聯對東北，並無侵略之圖謀，溥儀指出兩次事件「張鼓峯及以加爾湖事件」。蘇軍雖獲得勝利，但未繼續向前推進，此即為蘇聯在東北意圖之明證。溥儀將在兩次事件，與日本在中國之歷次事件對照，認為日本之行動，明白表示對中國之侵略圖謀。溥儀所提出之上項此喻，引起被告律師之不滿。詢　儀曰：「在法庭中提出此種事例，有何裨益？」溥儀遂重申：「余並未獲得任何諾言，余極願在此提出作證，蓋此乃余揭發日本對華壓迫機會」。被告律師又詢；「汝有未被人勸告，倘汝拒絕此種作證，則將對汝發生何種影響？」溥儀聞後出大聲笑曰：「此實可笑，余當然以余自己之自由意志，來此作證。」溥儀繼告庭上稱，渠至蘇聯後曾被蘇人訊問，渠向蘇人曾作聲明，但蘇人並未有何聲明。溥儀今日為第五日出庭作證，與昨日之作證不同。蓋今日已重獲他人之極大信任矣。</p>

<h3>國際局勢緊張聲中傳三巨頭將會晤　但尚未獲官方證實　杜魯門抵百慕大受熱烈歡迎</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕關於英相艾德禮美總統杜魯門暨蘇聯元帥史達林三巨頭會晤之說，據倫敦標準晚報載紐約來訊稱，杜魯門總梳對於舉行三巨頭會議，認為足以構成迅速解决當前最重要之國際問題最佳之辦法，故表示歡迎。國際局勢如不能改善，則三巨頭將於十一月以前在歐洲某地會晤。美國願在十一月國會改選之前，舉行三巨頭會議。民主黨在眾院內之勢力日見式微，如三巨頭會議在改選之後舉行，則社魯門總統即不能使其餘二巨頭相信其係代表美國人民發言云。頃據此間消息靈通人士談稱，三巨頭會議似不可能，英官方亦謂三巨頭會晤之說，並無所聞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿二日電〕此間盛傳英美法三國政府領袖將在大西洋中舉行會議。內閣主任法萊斯今日否認法總統己被邀請參與英首相文德禮及美總統杜魯門之大西洋會議，但謂英美兩國領袖或有會晤可能。美國方面則認三巨頭會議之說為「可笑」。</p>

<p>和會議場一瞥（法國大使館新聞處攝）</p>
<h3>三强問題的癥結　互柑猜忌和不信任</h3>
<p>— 歐洲問題權威作家蕭曼著</p>
<p>許多俄國人怕英美稱　歐亞，以求安全——因為這樣一來，蘇聯的安全將受威脅。而假使打起仗來，蘇聯將因此無法抗拒英美的力量。同樣的，許多英美人却也怕蘇聯在歐亞稱覇以求安全——因為這樣一來，英美的安全將受威脅，而英美將因此無法抗拒蘇俄的力量。雙方的怕本來是沒有根據的，更何况這種心理實在是赴死亡的捷徑，因為再打仗的話，結果一定是同歸於盡。國務卿貝爾納斯最近說過：「安全的尋求，也許會不增加甚至反而減少世界的安全。」他又說：「我們四週儘是犯忌和不信任，而因此更加多了犯忌和不信任。」</p>
<p>在這個情形之下——雙方都堅信對方要統制全世界——雙方將永遠不會互相信任。照美國看法，俄國一舉一動，如奪領土，管轄（？）在英美的共黨，和在東歐東亞極力促成親俄集團，都很容易被認做一種毀滅民主集團和建立大蘇維埃的陰謀。同樣的，照俄國看法，美國的汎美軍事合作政策，重要根據地，政治借款，以及英美集團的企圖，和强調巴島及中國的有產階級，都可以證明英美正在採取一種先包圍後殲滅蘇聯的計劃，而造成一個有聯繫的「大英」與「美國世紀」。兩方面的猜疑，都一點根據也沒有。可是雙方都在忙着弄手段，想策略，保護自己，對付假想的危機。這種畏懼，心理已經擴大到一個程度，使得每一個國際問題的解决，都既不根據問題本身的正誤，也不管聯合國的主旨是在聯合世界各國。要處理一個問題，最要緊的是：這樣解决，將怎樣影響對方（英美或蘇聯）的戰鬥力。</p>
<p>可是俄國的畏懼多半是因過去經騐而養成的。英美不能改變過去，可是如果能够明白過去對今日蘇聯的影響，他們可以減少不安全而因此改變未來</p>
<p>蘇聯不擇手段保障本身安全</p>
<p>在我們一代，俄國三次被人侵略摧毀，而三次侵略都是在最後關頭才被阻止的。像列寗格勒，莫斯科和史達林格勒的悲慘經歷，都是俄人沒齒難忘的。照蘇官方估計，從一九四一到一九四五年，蘇聯的損失共一千七百座城鎮七萬個村落，八萬四千所學校，四萬三千所圖書館，三萬一千工廠，一萬三千架橋樑，四萬哩鐵路，和七百萬人民。蘇聯在第二次世界大戰的損失，比所有同盟國的加起來還要重大。因此，蘇聯人民堅决要保護自身的安全，不擇手段，只要它能給他們保障。這種固執的决心，不能用主義上的特點來解釋。不過假使有人因此而下一個結論說：今日的蘇聯，不過是舊俄帝國的重演或是一個赤色法西斯的暴政，那可就忽略了人的本貿和蘇聯社會的動力。蘇聯的社會主義，不管是好是壞，决不是法西斯主義，也不是一種因內部問題無法解决而向外發展的侵略。</p>
<p>蘇駐聯合國安全理事會代表格羅米柯說：「蘇聯將來要保衛和平，正和她過去一樣，蘇聯人民深信蘇政府所採的和平政策，和舉行愛好和平憎厭戰爭的人民的利益定相符的。」但是，假使所用的手段，不減少而增加外族的疑懼，結果决非和平，而是更多的戰爭風險。蘇聯無力自「均衡」中求安全，因為英美的團結太鞏固了。俄國也沒有能力自「世界革命」中求安全，因為這樣將促成全世界非蘇維埃國家對俄的反抗。</p>
<p>蘇築二道防綫造成勢力範圍</p>
<p>剩下的，蘇聯只有一條路可以走——那就是在聯合國核心內促成三强合作；可是三强意見分歧，聯合國勢力薄弱，所以，不得已，俄國和英美一樣，只有倚賴本國的工業和軍力及有關的盟邦，折衝地和屬地，但是這個辦法、阻礙三强合作。也就是在這一點，蘇聯最感到矛盾。假使英法中美都存着畏懼和憎恨俄國的心理，那末怎麽聯合國大憲章，蘇英·蘇法·蘇中的同盟和友好條約，都不能作為安全的保障。結果，蘇聯不得不築「第二道防綫」——造成一個遼闊的勢力範圍，雖然這種防綫，在這火箭·原子彈時代，已經是不適用了。這種策略不幸反而增厚國外仇視疑懼的態度。一切防守的計劃，都有不幸的結果：三强頃軋，聯合國組織減弱，各國感到不安全，而因此加强防禦工作，結果是更多的新煩惱，新憤慨。</p>
<p>到現在為止，沒有辦法解决這互為因果的現像。要解决，就非得對英美蘇關係有深刻的認識。這個方式實在相當簡單，蘇政府一貫地以盟國共管聽國，及劃分歐亞邊區為蘇聯及英美地帶，解釋俄安全條件。這並不是說蘇聯有領土野心，實在還是蘇聯怕他國利用周圍地域向俄攻擊。過去，在一九〇四，一九一八，一九三七，一九三八，一九三九年外海來自東北；在一九一五年來自土耳其；在一九一八來自伊朗及土耳其；在一九一五，一九一八，一九二〇、及一九四一年，來自波蘭及巴爾幹半島。</p>
<p>因此，蘇政府堅持控制所有曾用以侵俄的水路與陸路東歐的斯拉夫足族，在蘇聯統治下求統一的運動，進一步加强蘇政府地域上的要求。除非有絕大威力，不會使得蘇政府改變上述的安全政策。在雅爾達，羅斯福，邱吉爾和雙方的顧問接受若干蘇聯的建戲可是自從去年八月後蘇聯認為貝文和貝爾納斯有意在已屬蘇勢力範圍之地域內，減少或消滅蘇聯的力量。</p>
<p>最使蘇聯受威脅的當然是原子彈。蘇政府的答覆是：坐守新地盤；質問英美印度尼西亞，近東，希臘，西班牙，的政策；提出反條件；寗可無限期的拖延和平，不願按受英芙的方案。</p>
<p>建立世界政府實為唯一出路</p>
<p>目前的爭覇戰，只可能有下列兩結果之一：（一）大戰，或是一種新的和解，（二）雙方互相接受和尊重對方的安全條件之定義，第一個結果實在就是人類末日。要恢復雅爾達會議時所表現的團結精神，那末三國的執政當局非得說話比現在坦白公正些，宗旨更誠實些，定義清楚些，而三强的關係要更平等，互惠些。楞是要這種團結有結果，所需要的條件還要多得多，而不是平常那種老式外交所能做到的。</p>
<p>這種瓜分全球的買賣，實在說倒是求生存的必需條件。可是它不能救世界。我們要救將來，就非得對世界秩序有一個新觀念不可。在今天的三强局面下就缺少這種時代需要的大胆和創造的精神。同樣的，在目前凡爾賽和約的作風下，也找不到這樣的精神。假定三强採取第一次大戰後的辦法，訂約，立同盟，建立國聯，那末結果這本來人類可以有力量造成樂園的世界，將變為一個瘡痍滿地的荒田。</p>
<p>我們這新時代所急迫需要的是剷除强權政治，建立一個管理各國的政府。要達到此目的，聯合國的範圍必得擴大，責任也得多多增加。假使蘇聯和英國，一個為了畏懼，一個為了疑惑，都不肯出面發動，那末美國運用她的威力來領導世界向這新目標走去。（椿譯）</p>

<h3>孫田昌植身份不明　張彬忱案待搜新證　清查團發表調查真相</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區敵偽產業接收處理工作清查團，駐滬辦公，瞬近一月，團長張知本，委員程中行，張慶楨，吳望伋，范爭波，及該團全體工作人員，辦理清查工作，備極認真，先後審查各機關接收工作報告，已達七十餘件，正在處理中之密告案件，共有二百條件，連日前往該團呈遞密告案件者仍極踴躍，各委員對密告案件之處理，除根據案情傳訊原被告詳加盤詰外，為獲得案情之真象起見，並不惜任何困難，多方搜集證據，必要時各委員且親自出外私訪，務期每一案件，均能水落石出，接收初期之種種黑幕現象，經該團揭發者，實不在少，已接收之密告案件中，除汪柱臣案已移送地檢處依法審理告一段落外，正在處理中之重要案件，有孫田昌忱秘售按收物資兩案，記者昨趨該團叩詢張委員慶楨，吳委員望伋處理該兩案詳情，承告如次：</p>
<p>案情曲折</p>
<p>關放孫田昌植一案，本團接受密告後曾一度傳記被告，並搜獲一部份證據，前日下午五時，余等與范委員親往孫田昌植之培開爾路工廠，貝當路住宅，西摩路倉庫察勘，化費數小時，其工廠倉庫所在地竟未覓得，僅在住宅內巡觀一過，其住宅純係新式建築棧房內，存有少量物品，當時因被告外出，故未作任何詢問，二十四日（今日）上午余等將繼續前往按址覓查，本案發生後，中韓文化協會，曾函本團，謂亦在派人查看，請予保留該會之發言權，故本案案情，殊為曲折，先決問題，似須確定孫田昌植之個人身份，她否有與敵勾結之嫌，再定處理辦法，本團現仍在儘速搜索證據中。</p>
<p>着重兩點</p>
<p>關終農林部上海經濟實騐農場場長張彬忱被控私售接收物資一案，密查內容着重兩點：（一）曾否接收乳牛一千餘頭，並掉換盜賣，（二）接收農場土地，曾否擅自分割盜賣，本團昨曾通知該場長來團查詢，據稱：農場乳牛，係向第三方面軍接收，共計三百餘頭，就中祇病牛死牛賣出若干頭，已呈報農林部，乳牛所生小牛，亦均經詳細呈報，有卷可查，有賬可稽，至於農場土地接收時，均有原始清冊可查，就中屬於民產部分，已分別發還，江灣農場一千畝地，祇開墾五十餘畝，并無擅自分割盜賣情形，渠并將接收時之原始清冊及有關案卷，移送本團審核中，該案前已經國民參政會提出檢舉，本團認為該案如無新證據提出，則案情并下十分重大，或係出於誤會，現仍在向原密告人搜集新證據，以便決走處理辦法。此外，對於接收倉庫，經本團抽查後，發現內部物資十分之六七已卸空，尚無堆積霉爛情事，至偷竊損失等，據該接收機關自稱：間亦不免，今後當仍陸續抽查，關於房屋分配所發生之弊端，本團現仍在偵查中。</p>
<p>停受密告·並非事實</p>
<p>另據該團負責方面表示：外傳本月二十四日，將停上接收密告辦理結束一節，實係不確，本團前曾通知，未送接收工作報告之各機關，限於二十四日前按期　齊，以便審查，或因此發生誤會。事實上本團除普通密告案件外，對重要密告案件，將來在駐杭工作時，仍擬留人在滬，繼續接收處理。</p>
<h3>市立第四醫院被檢舉正澈查</h3>
<p>另據記者向關係方面探悉：關於市立第四醫院私賣接收物責，經人向清查團密告檢舉後，日昨該團曾派員會向衛生局曹技正彭科長等前往該院澈查，發現重要案證頗多，正積極辦理中。</p>

<h3>偽造假美鈔尚無新發展　主犯瑞士人魏德萊通敵有實據查出曾為敵軍强購紫銅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕通敵戰犯端士人魏德萊，自經警備司令部逮補後，日來尚在偵訊中。據悉該犯售與日方之紫銅，原為我中央造幣廠在戰前向美商謀生洋行所定購，該批紫銅運抵時抗戰已經發生，即暫存於該洋行食庫中。至一九四一年十月間，魏德萊依仗日方勢力，以居間人之地位，强迫謀生洋行出售與日軍。當時市價約在一千萬元左右，而日方僅付款一百萬元。魏德萊由此曾獲巨額利益，其佑尼干路之住宅即為收獲之一云。現警備部方面尚在搜覓詳實證據，並將向瑞士領事館諮詢開除該犯國籍之原因，及請謀生洋行以畫面答覆當時被迫出售紫銅之情形。至於製造假美鈔部份，迄今尚無重要新發現，聞該犯將於一星期後解送法院云。</p>
<h3>逆產處理委會咋日正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局逆產處理委員會，昨晨十時成立，主任委員由劉攻芸局長兼任，副主委為高等法院檢察長杜保祺，共有委員九人，內中四人由處理局聘請，三人由法院聘任，據聞該委員會為一審議機構，不負直接處理責任。據另一方面探悉：關於逆產之處理辦法，近經國府修正處理原則，並即付施行：（一）敵偽產業處理局查封之漢奸嫌疑犯財產，尚未經法院偵訊者，應即移送法院核辦，唯法院查辦後，得委託敵偽產業局執行。（二）漢奸財產經法院判決沒收確定者，由法院移送敵偽產業處理局處理，惟當敵偽產業處理局撤消後，應移送地方財政機關處理。</p>

<h3>不勝外貨競爭烈製革業籲請貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市製革業公會，昨日招待新聞界，報告該業痛苦情形，並擬向政府呼籲積極貸款。據負責人稱：目前外貨運華，因係大規模製造，成本較國貨為廉，甚難與之競爭。最近外匯放長後，情形雖可望改善，雖製革業最大之困難為款項之週轉，市上拆息至少在月息兩角以上，實感不勝負担。政府對於工商業之貸款，規定須有相當規模，及工人在五十名以上，但製革業大都係小規模手工製造，故希望政府顧及實際困難，予以通融貸放。</p>
<h3>新聞界籌備慶祝九一記者節並追悼抗戰殉難同志</h3>
<p>「九一」記者節瞬息即屆，今年記者節雖為勝利後的第二次，但以去年節期，本市光復未久，新聞界復員伊始，一切尚未臻安定，故並未舉行慶祝。本市新聞記者公會，有鑒於此，復經常務理事會通過，爰於今年記者節日，舉行熱烈慶祝。慶祝方式，除於一日上午舉行紀念大會外，並於當晚舉行園游晚會，聚餐聯歡。同時為紀念抗戰期間，在滬與敵偽奮鬥而慘遭犧牲之新聞界同仁，特定於二日下午，舉行「上海新聞界抗戰殉難烈士追悼大會」，藉誌哀思。紀念會及追悼會各項籌備工作，現正積極進行，關於徵集殉難同仁事蹟遺像，推華美晚報張專韓，立報嚴服周兩君負責，各界如贈送　儀，請送至園明園路一四九號記者公會總服務組代收。又新聞界抗戰蒙難同仁，將由記者公會贈予紀念狀，於記者節紀念大會時授贈，亦請新聞界蒙難同志，於即日起，向該會總務組登記。</p>

<h3>榮永明罪行輕微　根據法律免押交保候訊最後或將判處罰金了案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五昌米行經理榮永明，已由警備司令部飭令交保後釋放，惟據軍法處負責人語記者稱：榮永明之釋放，並非即為無罪之表示，因榮氏在獄覊押已久，審查結果罪證不足，經函請市府再予提供有力證據，迄今尚無下文。現因該案不便久懸，經已按照審查結果呈請國防部核示中，而根據法律，凡罪行輕微者可以交保候訊，故暫予釋放云。據悉：榮永明案或將以判處罰金為最後結束。</p>
<h3>二百歲巨鷹展翅長丈許　今日起供眾參觀十天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年年底，天台山螺溪村有一鄉人，正在溪畔洗刷牛肚，忽然覺得兩肩好像給人抓緊，竟然不能動彈。回頭一看，原來一隻龐大兇惡巨鷹。（見圖）</p>
<p>鄉人和互鷹搏鬥起來，給巨鷹啄得衣碎肉裂，想逃走的時候，又給巨鷹拉住了振翼欲飛，掙扎約一小時，結果是遍體鱗傷，祗得狂呼救命。正好有一位中國飛禽研究社的許自强君，正和朋友們遊獵經過，連忙援救，可是竟是走不近那只巨鷹身邊！終於開了一槍，打中了巨鷹左翼，才把牠捉住。</p>
<p>據學者們考據，此鷹名為「羊鷹」，一向深居崇嶺絕谷，專門攫食蛇兔　羊，長得毛羽全黑，耳似人猿，頂茸獸毛，蟒頸鴟喙，　肩豺目，熊背牛腹，鎌冀鐵爪！叫起來驚人心魄，夜半更見凄厲，聞者毛骨悚然。昂立高四尺餘，展翅竟達丈許，體重也到四十二斤半！</p>
<p>據說，這種鷹一向生長於希馬拉雅山高原沙漠地區，這次到海邊來，實在是跟隨盟軍飛機，最後力竭而墮。現在許自强君已把這只驚烏護送來滬，經過八個多月豢養，已經比從前馴服多了。</p>
<p>這只羊鷹的年齡已達一百五十歲至二百歲之間，現定於二十四日起在寗波同鄉會展覽十天。愛好新奇的上海人士，又可一新耳目了。</p>

<h3>後方工廠復員會派代表赴牯請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國生產促進會後方工廠復負委員會，為請求救濟從方遷還工廠，建議組織聯合工廠，以謀迅速復員，曾於上月初推派代表晋京請願，經濟部部長王雲五除表同情外，並代呈政院批准，標售敵偽工廠時予以七折優待，然對聯合工廠之建議則未予同意。現各後方工廠對敵偽產業處理局所標售之敵產工廠，估價過昻，（一廠價目自數億元至數十億元不等）各工廠仍感不勝負担，故前日截止登記之第七期標售敵產工廠，應標者寥寥無幾，聞僅數家而已。該委員會決定今日推派代表謝天沙赴牯嶺晋謁主席，面陳一切云。</p>

<h3>祝平專題講演</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工務局舉辦之都市設計專題演講會，昨由地政局長祝平主講，講題為利用土地資金以發展地政。略稱此係實現民生主義之捷徑，若民生主義一旦實現，則糧荒，房荒皆能解決。現工務局所主持之都市計劃中，欲使建設大上海計劃之實現，亦首須利用土地資金，使市民踴躍投資，則戰後復興之具體計劃，即可逐步進行云。</p>
<h3>銀樓雙包案裘天寶兩號訟爭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市南京路三八三號裘天寶德記銀樓，戰前本設於南市小東門，上月十四日因見報載有重慶裘天寶福記銀樓遷滬，設址寶山路卅九號營業啟事，認為德記早於民國廿二年向本市社會局呈准創設註冊，轉向實業部領有營業執照，依法已領得名稱專用權，旁人不得再冒用設立，雙方乃在報上大登廣告，互相攻擊，最後終訴之於法。該案昨在地院民庭開審，原告德記裘天寶法定代理人姚聯芳延姜屏藩律師出庭，被告福記裘天寶法定代理人裘嘉和張聯堂則延陳震律師代辯。認為被告所設號名上，既已冠有重慶字樣，復有福記之分，且更聲明係田重慶遷滬，刊有重慶社會局准許遷滬營業之批示，自不能認為係影響朦混，應請庭上駁回原告之訴云。庭諭該案改期再訊。</p>
<h3>港美飛行員被殺案證人　磯谷昨被提訊　日方處置敵國飛行員條例是否適用為兩造辯論焦點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕月前自東京押解來滬經我軍法庭收押於提籃橋監獄之前香港總督磯谷廉介中將，昨以證人之地位，出現終美軍法庭上，為荷克少校被殺害案作證。因前兩日之審訊過程中，被告方面，供稱判處荷克死刑，係根據當時日政府頒佈之緊急處置敵國飛行員條例，故昨晨提出磯谷作蹬。開庭後首先仍由檢察官杜威氏向充作蹬人之被告山口教一發問，杜威指出山口之證述與去年十二月間在港受偵訊時大相逕庭，並指責日軍法庭，對於搜集證據極為忽略，甚至被擊沈漁船所載何項貨物，亦未調查。杜威繼囑山口說出當時係根據處置敵國飛行員條例第幾條判處荷克死刑，山口答稱，係第三條「襲擊商船罪」，杜威即出示當時宣判文件，則赫然係根據第二條「破壞非軍事性財產」論罪，斯時山口窘態畢露，諉稱係記憶錯誤。庭上即令磯谷上證人席，磯谷雖已老態龍鐘，面目極為凶惡，於捧讀由山口根據記憶默寫之該項條例後，即宣稱確係彼於一九四二年在香港所頒佈者，惟細節是否相符，已不能記憶云。檢察官當即指出彼不信有此項條例之存在，即使存在亦不適用於本案，被告辯護人則請求庭上或則承認磯谷所證明，或則將本案擱置，以供東京方面將此項條例抄寄後再行開審。庭上為此退庭商議二小時餘，迄記者離庭時猶無結果。據悉該案可能在一二日內結束。又前曾在瀋陽美戰犯集中營虐待美戰犯之日軍二名，將於最近受美軍法庭之審訊，該二人為松田中校及川島上尉。</p>
<h3>台灣失竊金塊案數錢莊銀樓被控</h3>
<p>〔合眾社本埠訊〕關於台灣失竊大批金塊一案，台灣當局昨日在地方法院對六家以上之銀樓及錢莊提起訴訟，追回全部賊贓時，發覺現已退伍返國之前美國陸軍中校，竊取價值美金十五萬元之台灣金塊，同時據稱，各銀樓錢莊所收贓物之總值約計美金一百萬元之譜。據悉該美國軍官於戰事結束時，首先到達台灣，自日軍手中接收金條三千九百九十二盎司，調將轉交中國當局。但該軍官除將半數移交中國政府外，其餘自行吞沒。渠去年返滬時，曾假另一美軍官之手，私售黃金一千九百九十六兩。中國當局於訊問台灣某日軍官時，始行破獲此案。據台灣當局所接獲華盛頓官方之消息稱：該犯法軍官既已退伍，不致受軍事法庭審判，倘不擬在美國法庭開審，則中國當局可要求將該犯引渡至中國法庭受審。</p>
<h3>魏濟民談八艦人事略有更動</h3>
<p>海軍艦隊指揮所參謀長魏濟民氏，前隨美贈華之太康等八艦晋京後，業已公畢，於昨日返滬，中央社記者特往晤訪，叩詢新艦隊情况，據魏氏談稱，新艦隊自美駛返國後，為適合我海軍之編制，故予適當調整，前指揮官林遵，現在京辦理移交手續，一俟移替竣事，當即赴美返任，故指揮官一職，由渠兼任，外間所傳種種實屬非是。並謂徐亨被扣，亦不知根據何在，刻徐亨奉命調海軍總部服務，已有事實證明，無庸贅述。現該艦正留京加强訓練，相當時期後，即駛他處服勤。至新艦隊人事之更調，計太康艦艦長梁序昭，改由高舉繼任，太平艦艦長曹仲周，改由麥士堯繼任。永寗艦艦長徐亨，改由王恩華繼任。其他人事，並無多大更迭云。</p>

<h3>召回留日學生辦法　教部正在縝密擬訂中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕在抗戰期間，赴日本留學之中國學生，因彼時情形不同，留學生之資格未加愼舉。勝利以後，此項留學生之費用供給，因物價高漲之波動，已成爲問題。日本方面已向中國當局提出要求：召回此項留學生。中國外交部已與敎部接洽，敎部已決意召回留學日本之中國學生。惟當前有四項問題：（一）回國生之交通，因人數過多，如何遷運？（二）國內在僞組織時代之學校學生，曾經過甄審試騐，核定其成績，而在戰時留日之學生資格極亂，乃至有中學未畢業即留學者，此時召回後之學生資格，如何審定及承認？（三）召回後之就業問題。如何計劃？（四）許多留學生帶眷屬留日者，此時誰應帶眷同歸？誰不應公黨帶回？皆須硏究其資格，並討論適當之辦法。聞敎部現正縝密擬訂是項辦法，日內即正式發表。</p>

<h3>怎樣推進藝術教育？</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>藝術敎育的意義，究竟怎樣？我們只要參看敎育部訂的課程標準，關於中小學藝術課程之目標，便可明瞭，約略言之，「愛美」和「美的創造」，爲人類本能，如何滿足和發展這本能？便是藝術敎育的使命了。</p>
<p>藝術敎育雖然有牠的價値，敎育部雖然訂有標準，而一般人都沒有注意，各學校都沒有認眞地實行。過去抗戰期間不必說，抗戰以前，就上海的中等學校而論，百分之六十以上沒有藝術科的設置。如今勝利了，對於「原子能」之類的科學敎育，固應迎頭趕上去，而可以發揮人類博愛仁慈德性的藝術，不妨在「敎育第一」的目標之下，使牠和科學敎育得到平行的發展，將來也許有這樣一天：全世界人類沈浸在藝術的空氣中，由美而善，由善而眞，使科學的昌明，不作殺人的利器，而成爲利人的工具，達到天下爲公，康樂富强的一天。</p>
<p>推進藝術敎育，必需敎育行政當局的督促指導，和學校方面的認眞實施。積極方面講：便有兩個問題，一是設備問題；一是師資問題。設備必需經費，如果有了充分的經費，那末，理想一點。藝術敎育便該有特別教室，如圖畫敎室，勞作敎室，音樂敎室等，各種工具，以及光線配置等均須完善合理，勞作方面—如金工，木工，黏土工，以及籐工等需要工具甚多，圖畫方面—如石膏模型，寫生書架，作品範本等等，音樂方面—如風琴，鋼琴，以及提琴等。無論公私立學校，應在購置預算中，劃出一部分經費，用之於藝術科的設備。</p>
<p>至於師資一層，成爲目前最嚴重之問題。前此國立藝專敎務長謝海燕君，由渝來信，關於藝術敎育師資問題，他有確實的估計：目前全國中等學校包括中學，師範，職業等共計三千四百五十五校，二萬四千六百六十四班，學生一百十一萬一千人，敎員八萬四千人，藝術科敎員至少該有七千五百人，（包括勞作，音樂，美術）現有中等學校藝術師資四千五百人，不足數目在三千人以上。所以許多學校根本請不到藝術科教員。敎育部長在參政會上報吿：爲適應戰後建設，將來中等學校，照現狀要擴充二倍至三倍。如此中等學校的藝術師資，便缺少二萬五千人。這是全國的情形。即就上海而論，目前公私立中等學校二百四十校，其中大部份尙沒有藝術科的設置，一旦各校均遵照部定課程標準而實施藝術敎育，那末術師資的恐慌，一時無法可以解决的。</p>
<p>藝術敎育將實施對象，且不限於學校，一般社會上隨時隨地，都可以傳布，可是藝術敎育建設者，藝術師資，成爲七年之病，求三年之艾，非積極訓練不可。最近，上海市敎育當局，有鑒於此，已着手籌設藝術師範，本學期即可成立招生，將來對於藝術師資問題，可以得到逐漸解决。一般的藝術設施，在市政經費如此困難的情形之下，宜於現有的社會機關裏，兼辦關於藝術方面的工作，發動各種藝術運動，各音樂演奏會，美術展覽會，以及畫廊講座等等，使社會民衆，隨時隨地受到藝術敎育的陶冶，實在非常需要的。</p>

<h3>中紡今日開董事會　各方關心派貨問題　實銷未動黑市乃投機造成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡織建設公司將於今日（二十四）召開董事會會議，棉紡及以紗布爲原料之複製工業，如染織工業，針織工業，毛巾被毯工業，手帕工業，內衣工業等，自外匯變動，棉紗黑市猛漲，對於中紡今後之方針，正加以密切之注意，即與中紡互爲表　之民營紗廠工業對此亦甚表關心，據業中人談稱，日來中紡紗布掛牌，始終未隨匯價猛漲，民營紗廠之廠盤，雖有上漲，究因此而受相當限制，至於黑市之漲，一方面由於少數紗廠不願多開，另一方面出於市上無聊掮客，製造空氣，實則客帮實銷，並未增加，本市各複製工業，閉歇　　，存在者亦少工作，從需供上計算，殊無漲價之理由，且中紡生產能力增加青島各廠經吳副經理親往整頓後，產品亦增，近來本市開派之貨，青島貨已配搭不少，可爲明證，至於民營紗廠，存花豐富，生產方面，更無問題，除非另有外來刺激，紗布市面，可望平穩云，據接近中紡公司者指陳，以紗布爲原料之複製工業，及以紗布爲商品之販　商業，經過同業公會在中紡登記獲有派貨　者，單位多至數千，而市面看漲之時請購者戶限爲穿，一遇疲落，則門可羅雀，自外匯變動，人心刺激，請購者蜂集，且其在請購單上所塡寫之希望數量，往往大得不合情理，因此公司方面不得不認眞核减，且將登記冊上之全數廠號，隔日分批開派，以維秩序云，中紡負責人表示，必須注重生產事業，以免取巧者以一轉手之勞，在掛牌與黑市之差額上，坐獲厚利，且稱對於各廠號之資格將認眞甄別云，民營棉製品之複製工業界負責人談稱，數月以來，紗價高漲，而製成品則有洋貨傾銷，且內地實銷又少，欲漲不得，因之在兩面夾攻之中，日益萎疲，外匯變動之後，該業並無生色，如中紡掛牌能不生刺激，尙可免於意外，又稱日來各廠向中紡請購之多，實係不堪黑市壓迫所致，希望轉手派貨能切實减少，生產派貨能上正軌，至於無廠而派貨者，或廠在停閉之中而請派者，自應切實整頓，但販賣字號方面，應否與廠家同樣派貨，尙須請當局考慮，據消息靈通者傳稱，各該棉製品複製工業，正在集合意見，擬且計劃，呈請經濟部及吳市長平衡紗價，並請中紡以身作則云。</p>

<p>昨日紗市略形軟化，人心因震於　論界之攻擊，同行傾向轉賣，是以各支紗俱見回降，同時天津紗價不振，津帮申莊反胃吐售，是以廿支紗除雙馬屹然未動外，其餘均跌一二萬，雙股綫最高曾哄至二百十八萬，旋以二百十萬收市。午時紡建仍平價開售紗綫，有　各業無不爭先承購。</p>
<p>布市始漲繼回，但實際銷路並不十分興奮，惟北路及長江南方一帶對於深色貨皆有需要，V龍頭閩方納胃較暢，但紡建開售之布，籌碼尙能充足，所以漲風不大，惟通知單氣勢益盛，晨初買者較衆，繼以浮多吐出，又復回挫，結果漲五百至一千元。</p>
<h3>土糖號盤仍緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市公會交易仍在停頓中，僅行號間直接做開，略有點綴，青糖以近乏續到，兼之產價轉企，故申市正值現貨軋缺之際價乃較緊，昨市又升一二千元，其他赤白糖亦叫升，其勢須俟後貨有到，方能轉鬆。</p>

<p>洋木日來亦曾一度受外匯調整之影響而高昇，但市塲交易清稀，旋即恢復原價，國產不材價格多未更動，木材市况之疲，據業中人謂空前未有。</p>
<p>火油另售價已下瀉，前日喊價每聽五介侖裝爲一萬五千元，各零售商均因無人購買，昨已回跌二三千元，聞零售商向經理商批購，爲每介侖一千四百元，加上聽子四千元，成本亦不過一萬一千元，而油站零沽每磅仍爲一百四十元。</p>

<h3>動盪中的「行總」</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　平齋</p>
<p>民國三十二年十一月九日，四十四個聯合國家的代表齊集在美國總統府，簽訂了聯合國善後救濟公約。接着代表們就到大西洋城去開第一次國際善後救濟大會，這次大會中決定了一件歷史上空前的偉舉——成立「聯總」。四十四個國家，就在這個組織之下，羣策羣力，來辦理有系統的，有計劃的善後救濟。</p>
<h3>一個偉大試驗</h3>
<p>三十三年三月，我國行政院的善後救濟調査設計委員會開始工作，由蔣廷黻先生任主委，但蔣先生這期間正在美國辦理對外的折衝，所以實際上主持會務的是中國農民銀行總經理顧季高先生，他會同了十多個有關部會裏派出的高級人員，還有「聯總」派出的三位專家，提出了一個週密的報吿。根據這個報吿，我國善後救濟的費用共須美金二十五億元，外加具有戰前購買力的法幣二十七億元。</p>
<p>但是，「聯總」自己經費的總數却祗有美金二十億元。</p>
<p>結果，我國在九月三十日把報吿送達「聯總」，調査設計委員會的計劃和預算大體上仍舊維持，不過，我國向「聯總」表示希望協助美金九億四千五百萬元，其他部份則由中國政府及人民自籌。</p>
<p>「聯總」接受了我國的請求。到三十四年一月，執行這個善後救濟任務的機構終於成立了，就是「行總」。</p>
<p>「行總」的工作是艱巨而重要的，因爲如果這個組織辦得成功，中國便可以在這空前良好的機會中很快的恢復元氣；反之，如果辦得失敗，那末不但全中國的老百姓將多受顚沛流離以至飢饉的痛苦，就是中國的地位也將在聯合國家之間一落千丈。而且，在別種新的試騐中，失敗的經騐可供下一次努力時作爲借鏡，終於有助於最後的成功；但在辦「行總」的時候却就很少這種改善的機會，因爲試騐的時期至多祗有三年，如果發現了錯誤，就是馬上着手改正，也往往已經趕不及了。</p>
<h3>怎樣幹？</h3>
<p>「行總」可能遭遇的困難，蔣先生並不是沒有預先料到。在他那本小册子「善後救濟總署——幹什麼？怎樣幹？」裏，他首先指出了「行總」應當具備的三個條件：第一，應該辦事迅速：因爲，「倘若我們應該作的事不能於兩年之內作完，我們就不能取得聯總的協助了。」第二，行總應與行政院所屬其他各部會署竭誠的分工合作，不可起磨擦，尤不可起衝突，避免一切無聊的不必要的糾紛。他明確地指出了：「根據經騐，我知道機關與機關之間，分工不易，合作尤難。這一次事業尤其複雜，因爲我們一面必須在國內辦救濟，一面又須在國外應付聯總及其所屬的大會，委員會和辦公廳」。第三，行總的人員必須廉潔。他說，「倘若不幸發生舞弊的案情，不但物資的損失可惜，政府在國際上名譽的損失尤爲可惜」。同時，他指出了單有物資而沒有人，事業還是辦不成，他以爲行總的業務全部開展的時候，需要外籍專家約達一千五百名之多。他認爲如果這次大量聘用客卿的試騐能够成功，將成爲行總重要貢獻之一。</p>
<p>那本小册子是卅四年七月間出版的，蔣先生周密的計劃和對事業的熱情使全國水深火熱中的同胞歡欣鼓舞，各地都紛紛要求行總趕快開始工作，大有「后來其蘇的感覺。而且，因爲敵人很快就投降了，這些工作更有馬上推進的必要。</p>
<p>卅四年冬天，行總到達了光復不久的上海。十二月中旬，開始在上海發售平價麵粉，疫苗由上海向漢口廣東等地運出，收復區裏先後成立了十五個行總分署，工作加速推進起來，蔣先生也到了上海，和聯總那時的副署長韓雷生一同招待記者的時候，蔣先生說，「聯總將有大批援助物資來華，計劃定可付之實施」。接着，他說：「在最近一二年中，全中國可無飢荒」。</p>
<p>千千萬萬輾轉於戰神鐵蹄之下已達八年的民衆，在聽到了這些諾言之後，的確是曾經感激涕零過的！</p>
<h3>幹什麼？</h3>
<p>這次辦理善後救濟有一個最引人的特色，就是：這次和以往的放賑不同，這次是「有系統的，有計劃的」。「有系統」可以包括在「有計劃」之中，那麼這個「計劃」倒底是怎樣一個內容—行總預備幹些什麼呢？</p>
<p>三十三年九月卅日，蔣先生代表政府，向聯總提出了一個文獻，這文獻的題目就是「中國善後救濟計劃」，—共計十一册！而「各項資料，尙未齊備」。</p>
<p>依照這個計劃，救濟的範圍是北到黑龍江，南到兩廣，西到川陜甘寗，東到台灣，共分爲十一個區。這十一個區內的總人口是四萬六千一百萬，其中急待救濟的淪陷區內的總人口是二萬六千六百萬。對聯總希望接濟的項目，大槪是這樣！</p>
<p>一·糧食—在最初十二個月內，希望輸入三·二七〇·〇〇〇公噸。其中不但有米，有麥，就是魚和肉也有二萬五千公噸。對婦嬰的營養尤爲注意，有奶粉，有肉湯粉（每年請求接濟四萬公噸），還有魚肝油，鈣素片，糖。共値美金一億五千餘萬元。到本月六月底爲止，本應運華九一八·九七八噸，但到五月底左右，祗來了三七八·二三五噸，差不多祗及原額十分之四。</p>
<p>二·衣服——中國請求聯合國資助棉花，棉布，紡錠（四十萬），零件，縫紉機，綫，針，共重十四萬公噸，値美金一億五千餘萬元。（到六月底止，本應運華一三五·四二四噸，但到五月底左右祗來了三九·〇三三噸，不到原額十分之三。）</p>
<p>三·房屋——分爲二類，一是臨時住所，分設水陸交通各站，以便難民途中住宿。二是帮助人民修理，改裝及重建其被戰爭毀壞之房屋。這裏，中國要求聯合國接濟物資五萬公噸，値美金五百萬元。</p>
<p>四·醫藥衛生——要辦理醫藥救濟，防疫，婦嬰衛生，藥品救濟，同時更訓練人才，共要求物資七萬四千公噸，計値美金六千六百萬元，並請聯合國資助延聘外國專家七百二十五人。（六月底止，本應運華一四·七二一噸，五月底左右已到一三·九八八噸。）</p>
<p>五·交通運輸——這是我國要求的接濟之中最重要的一項，包括鐵路網，公路網及水運交通器材，我國請聯總協助的數字，是一百六十萬公噸的物資，價値美金三億三千萬元，換句話說，就是差不多相當於食糧，衣服，房屋這三種接濟的總和。（本年八月底止，本應運華七三四·三〇九噸，到五月底左右祗來了三分之一不到，計一七九·三二五噸。）</p>
<p>六·農業——行總期望能做到（一）糧食增產（包括五榖，蔬菜，牲畜，漁類），（二）衣服原料增產（包括棉，絲，毛等），（三）出口物品增產，以期覓取外匯，償付必需輸入之物品，（四）恢復鄕村農業，藉以解除農民困苦，穩定農村經濟。要求聯合國補助物資六十六萬公噸，價値美金七千七百萬元。同時更請代聘外籍專家三十九人來華工作，並資助中國專家五十九人出國深造。</p>
<p>七·工業——行總預備辦理一點近代式的工業，包括麵粉廠，榨油廠，煉糖廠，棉紡，毛紡，水泥廠，鋸木廠，造磚廠，玻璃廠，煤礦，電力廠，自來水廠，機器廠，電工器材廠，煉鋼廠，肥田粉廠，灰鹹廠，燒鹼廠，肥皂廠，造紙廠，橡皮工廠，需要中國工程師八·〇二二人，技工二六·九八三人，並擬請外籍工程師三五一人，技工七二九人。請求聯總的帮助，是器材十九萬噸，價値美金一億一千五百萬元。</p>
<p>八·泛濫區域——包括黄河花園口堵口，復堤，淮河修復，豫皖泛區排水改善等工程。器材方面所需的接濟，約四百萬美元，重九千公噸。並需延聘外籍工程師一人或二人，技工二十人。計劃書中在這一節特別指出：「國幣部份經費，數額鉅大，共計國幣六千八百萬元。倘能將聯總資助我國之糧食，移充工賑之用，則國幣經費，大可减少。估計是項工程所需米麥等糧食，共計十萬九千噸。」</p>
<p>九·社會福利——包括救濟難童，殘廢等等。行總擬設立區域救濟隊三十，縣福利救濟事業中心站三百，村鎭救濟組八百，共需人員七千人。此外，並供給家用器皿，及民衆謀生的工具，更設托兒所五百，每所容兒童五百人。對於難民回鄕之協助，則設難民招待所五百所。食品供應站五百所，每所供應一千人之飯食二餐。另設殘廢人員訓練所五個。請求聯總的接濟，是物資二萬七千噸，價値美金三千二百萬元，並擬聘請外國專家二百三十人，並資助中國專家一百人出國深造。</p>
<p>十·難民——招待所與救濟品，共需接濟値美金五百六十萬元，包括物資一千噸。</p>
<p>中國善後救濟事業所需國外輸入之物資，在十八個月內，共計美金二·五三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，共重一〇·〇〇〇。〇〇〇公噸，我國向聯總提出要求接濟的，祗及這個數額的百分之三十七，計美金九四五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，重四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇公噸。</p>
<p>這個計劃書在美國公佈之後，輿論界非常之注意。蔣先生說，「當時各方的感想，兩句話可以包括：（一）數字何其大耶！（二）參酌中國抗戰之久和戰區之大，數字却在情理之中。」</p>
<p>但是，儘管是「在情理之中」罷，聯總方面却做了一樁「意料之外」的決定，他們把我們已經打了折扣的數字再打一個六折，對這個九億四千五百萬美金的請求，祗核准了五億六千萬美元。而且，運來的物資中，有許多根本不在原來的計劃之內。因之，行總所能做的工作，變爲祗是將聯總運來的物資加以處理和運輸到需要的地點了。</p>
<h3>「超過了估計」</h3>
<p>三個月之後，局面已經轉變到極嚴重的階段。蔣先生坦白而誠摯地指出了全世界糧食問題的嚴重，他承認，「糧食的實際需要已經超過了從前所估計的數量」，而聯總所能供應的却遠在原來計劃之下。因之，他不得不乘出國參加四届聯總大會的機會，親自去推動糧食的接濟問題。</p>
<p>他說，「擺在我們前面的局面，比在計劃中的更嚴重，更困難」。鐵路，房屋，城市……等等的破壞，都超越當初的估計，尤其是廣西，湖南，湖北，江西，浙江，河南等省。造中國式房子所需要的磚瓦木料：聯總都是無法供給的。</p>
<p>遣送難民的時候，也發生了新的困難。難民詳細的統計數字旣無從得到，倒是在重慶還發現過假冒難民的情形。在漢口，又發現有人帶着嗎啡和白面在難民裏面做生意。</p>
<p>運輸的情形也非常嚴重。陸上交通被戰爭完全破壞了，但是，內河沿海裏所急需的船隻却又不够。這困難使行總不得不仰仗太古怡和的船隻帮忙，結果是立刻引起了航業公會極忿慨的抗議，引起了保衛內河航權的軒然巨波。</p>
<p>這些困難，都是蔣先生在三月七日對行總在滬人員的談話中親自指出的，發表了這篇演說之後，他匆匆趕到了美國。四月十七日，蔣先生在美國吿訴聯合社記者說，「余此次來美係代表中國要求源源接濟糧食，但余不得不承認所負使命，已歸失敗。聯總已削减中國要求之數量，英美加聯合糧食委員會復再度加以减低。吾人要求接濟肥料五十萬噸，結果僅獲一萬噸，英國又因政治及經濟關係，不願以暹邏餘糧接濟中國……」前美國總統胡佛到中國調査糧食情况之後，到上海來出席聯總遠東區大會的美國代表吉爾配屈律克，在五月廿五日說的話却是「華盛頓已深信中國糧荒，實甚嚴重，但是否因此而能增加配給，則有待於世界糧食情形之改善」。</p>
<p>然而，在湖南，在蘇北，廣西，江西……三千萬飢民却正在天天掙扎着，樹皮和草根都快吃完了！</p>

<h3>「强有力的機構」</h3>
<p>蔣先生在籌備組織行總的時侯說，「我們所需要的是一種强有力的機構，少帶行政性質，多帶業務性質」。</p>
<p>在這個原則之下，行總的組織是比較新，也比較特殊的，它的內部單位，分儲運，分配，財務，振恤四「廳」，另有總務，會計，調査，編譯四「處」，還有工礦，農業，衛生三個委員會，一個人事室，儲運廳負責點收物資，並且要輸送這些物資到使用地點。在交通衝要地點，儲運廳設立若干儲運局。分配廳根據各省市縣及各種事業的需要，負責決定分配數額及先後緩急的次序。財務廳掌管物資出賣及賣價的運用，蔣先生指出此舉的目的在於「一則以協助政府其他機關平定物價，一則以籌備工賑事業的經費」。振恤廳負責辦理緊急救濟，帮助難民回家，及籌劃工賑。總管全署事務的是署長，署長之下有兩位副署長協助一切。另外還有一位執行長，負責執行一切業務，並監督各廳各分署，物資如需變賣，亦須先由執行長核准。此外，行政院另派代表，駐行總分配廳辦公，而行總更另派代表駐於行政院負責聯絡，很有些像國際間互派使節辦理外交的樣子。</p>
<p>當然還有參事，秘書，廳長，副廳長，處長，視察，技正，科長，編審，技士，科員——還有聘用的國內外專門人員，雇員，而聯總駐華辦事處也在各部門派遣「顧問」，以便「觀察」。</p>
<p>此外，在受戰事損害較重的地區，行總還設立了十五個分署（東北，台灣，冀熱平津，晋綏察，魯靑，河南，上海，蘇寗，浙閩，安徽，江西，湖北，湖南，廣東，廣西，）下設賑務，儲運，衛生，總務四組，若干工作隊，由組長，副組長，隊長分別負責。</p>
<p>當然也還有秘書，視察，技正，技士，組員和雇員。</p>
<p>在沒有行總分署的地區，另外還設立「善後救濟審議委員會」，人選由行總就各該區域內政軍各界及社會負有聲望的人士中遴聘。</p>
<p>所以，以上海一市而論，就有「行總」總署，行總上海分署，外加聯總駐華辦事處。到了鎭江，就又有行總蘇寗分署，到了南京，却還有一個行總總署的一部份。</p>
<p>再舉一個小一點的例子：上海的總署裏有儲運廳，上海分署有儲運組，而另外上海還有一個儲運局，（因爲上海是裝卸物資極多的地方）。</p>
<p>署長和執行長的職堂是很難劃分的，尤其是這幾個月來執行長的職權似乎頗有消長。最近，好像署長已經變了國府主席執行長彷彿是行政院長的樣子，但是這個「行政院」下面各部門的首長却又是署長委派，就任早在執行長之前。</p>
<p>於是，公文就不斷的在打着圈子，出了什麼事情時，推諉起責任來却往往又非常容易。</p>
<h3>事在人為</h3>
<p>這樣一個龐大的組織，這樣一件艱巨的工作，人的問題當然是非常重要的。蔣先生在他那本「善後救濟總署——幹什麽？怎樣幹？」裏開卷第一章就是「人力可以勝自然」而最後一章也還是「事在人爲」，可見他對於「人」的問題重視。「行總」的確網羅了不少優秀的人材，他們有熱情，有能力，有許多是在以前早已在各種事業上有相當成績和地位的。</p>
<p>但是，即使在這個嶄新的機構裏，中國官塲上沿襲而來的一個最討厭的現象—門戶之見，却還是沒有能够免掉，加上這個機構裏又是「經過銓叙的人員與不經過銓叙的人員兼用」的，要能够密合無間就不容易，因之也就無法發揮最高度的效率。而且，行總的組織又是暫時性質的，有許多能够找到一個比較永久性質的職位的人，就不願爲行總工作。就是目前還在行總工作的人，也往往想盡法子要找一個比較永久性的職位，「五日京兆」的心理多多少少地存在於行總的每一個職員的心裏。至於有許多天天鑽頭覓縫想加入行總的人，却誠如蔣先生所說，是想來作官的。這現象在「天高皇帝遠」的幾個分署裏更爲顯著，我們祗要翻一翻幾個省參議會開會時候質詢的紀錄，就可以發現目前遭受攻擊得最利害的，不是別的機關，而正是特地到這些省份去普救衆生的行總。行總分署長個人受到批評的也並不在少，然而我們還沒有看見過總署毅然加以撤換。固然總署也許另有苦衷，但根本上沒有適當的後任一定也是主要原因之一。</p>
<p>「行總」執行長劉鴻生氏（本報記者顧廷鵬攝）</p>
<h3>我們需要外籍專家來帮忙</h3>
<p>惟其因爲好的人材不够，所以。每天祗是來應應卯，敷衍敷衍就走的人也有了，外勤職員之中招人物議的也有了。上海的儲運局更是黑幕重重，人言嘖嘖。蔣先生因為補救人材缺乏而延攬了不少「客卿，」而想不到就是客卿之中，也發生過有使聯總不得不特地派員査賬的不快事件。</p>
<p>最近聯總下令停運物資來華後，蔣先生在招待記者席上，竟又會意外地被外國記者指摘報吿的統計數字和聯總的數字不符，雖然到後來査出來是輕噸重噸互用的關係，然而在這種地方，我們不能不指出行總主管儲運的職員未免太疏忽。這種疏忽本來就可能引起嚴重的誤會，何况在那時聯總對我們的觀感又正是最容易被挑撥離間的時候！如果行總署長經常所收到的都是那種馬馬虎虎的情報和統計，後患還堪設想嗎？</p>
<p>「行總」職員很多，眞正在任勞任怨埋頭苦幹的又祗有多少？蔣先生說過，「辦理善後救濟的機關本身不能作爲失業人員的救濟所，「然而外面悠悠之口，在鎭江，在廣州，都有人說過救濟總署已成爲「救濟本署」了，我不願以這種不負責任的譏評來指摘行總，但是我希望行總當局在爭取這剩餘下來寥寥幾個月的時候，拿出決心來，用事實來消弭這種議評！</p>
<p>蔣先生說，「行總的業務全部展開的時候，外籍專家在我們這裏服務者將到一千五百名。」這些外籍專家；不一定都是在行總所屬的機關中工作，有很多都是行總和行政院各部會商妥之後，由行總出面到外國請來，就在這些部門——如農林部，交通部，衛生署……等裏工作。但是截至本年五月底止，到華的外籍專家，尙祗四百名左右。</p>
<p>我國科學落後，技術人員的缺乏是一個無可諱言的事實，而應聘來華的專家之中，的確有不少是全爲熱心驅使，想到中國來好好做一番事業的，即如經辦黄河堵口工程的塔德工程師，其奔波之忙，各方應付時用心之苦，眞是勞苦功高，充份表現了盟邦對我國的友情，美國的時代週報上稱譽他「功繼大禹，」實在是並沒有過份的。</p>
<p>不過，這些專家們派遣來華的時候，手續上顯然很有需要改善的地方。據我們所知，他們來華之前，往往並不通知行總，而且和聯總接濟物資的程序，也沒有完全配合。專家們往往突然蒞止，行總和他們安插職務的時候自然不免就有躭擱了。又如來了許多漁業專家的時侯，往往需要他們指敎用法的機器却一件也沒有來。當然有了機器沒有人指示用法的情形也不是沒有。經費固然浪費，就是這些專家們的光陰也就爲之虛擲了。</p>
<p>此外，行總有許多並非專家的外籍職員，如打字員，速記員，視察……等等，數目相當可觀。其中有一部份是聯總「借」給行總的，尤以軍人爲多。行總要供給他們相當好的宿舍，膳食，而這筆費用如果能够拿來聘請中國職員，未始就不能用到相當優秀的人材。這些外籍人員多數對中國會議的進程不够深刻，而感覺倒往往極深，於是他們旣覺得處處不順手，而中國職員倒反而把很多的時間費在翻譯和解釋上面了。現在行總的文件幾乎每種都要有中英文兩份，試問這又浪費了多少時間，金錢，和人力呢？</p>
<p>譬如說，叫一個外國視察到外而去考査分署工作情形，而這個視察也許還是第一次到中國來，試問他又能知道多少？即使眞有人舞弊他也未必能洞澈底蘊罷？</p>
<p>而這些外籍人員在許多小的地方，因爲種種關係，也往往使行總的中國職員爲之側目。例如，他們在本國是坐慣汽車的，於是到了行總來，就出門非吉普車代步不可，而中國職員如果要坐汽車，却必須寫條子，經過核准，地位雖高，往往倒常不如一個小小外國打字員之縱橫如意——明明是一個屬於行政院的機關，却染上了洋行風氣！</p>
<h3>超乎政治　一心一意</h3>
<p>蔣先生對聯總首任署長李門先生的介紹詞裏說：「李門先生以前作過八年紐約州州長，富有行政經騐，而他的政治思想又很與羅故總統接近。他現在脫離政治，一心一意的領導聯總，爲戰後的痛苦民衆謀福利。」誠然，要使善後救濟工作辦好，「脫離政治」和「一心一意」是必要的條件。但是，要「脫離政治」是很困難的事情。</p>
<p>行總在中國本土裏運輸物資，時常發生被軍隊阻擋攔截的情形，治理河道用的機器，也會給人家炸毀。恢復鐵路，公路等交通網本來是行總計劃中最龐大的一部份，要求聯總的接濟比要求衣食的總數還要超出很多。——但是這個恢復交通問題所包括的政治關係之複雜又是怎樣？</p>
<p>交通問題不能解決，那麽普遍的救濟就談不到。指定給廣西的救濟物資到了廣東，廣東的行總分署就把它們截下給廣東人了，於是廣西就祗能落空。上海的吳市長也曾經說過，要是米糧眞的不來，他就決定先用了行總的食糧再說，這件事雖未實行，然而筆者當日看見過吳市長說這幾句話時的神色——他是的確想這樣辦的。〔轉第九版〕</p>

<h3>台灣省山地行政的輪廓　中華民族新細胞</h3>
<p>— 十八日台灣航訊　何敏先</p>
<p>台灣省高山人民（日本人目之爲蕃族）計有七族，人口達十五萬一千四百七十人，散佈各縣山地。過去日人歧視彼輩爲劣等民族，設「理蕃課」作特別之行政措施，以警察控制一切，兼用懷柔隔離政策，與平地居民絕少往來，設立交易所，統制其經濟，設立敎育所，禁錮其思想，五十年來日人初期之威壓討伐，以後之敎育授產，其目的在異糜人心，奴化思想，而漸使其淘汰消滅，是以迄至今日該族文化落後，生產貧乏，仍度其原始式之生活，光復後台省陳長官有鑒及此，爰本民族平等原則，決普及敎育，注重衛生，指導生產，改善生活，以扶植其自立，提高其智識水準，同時組織山地考察團，及山地施政研究委員會，派員携帶物品入山宣慰，實地考察情形，以爲施政依據，近半年來台省對於山地行政之如何計劃，推行經過，及所收成果等，諒爲各地讀者所樂聞，茲就記者向各有關方面訪問所得，報道如下：</p>
<p>考察研究　山地考察團是由各廳處會局各派一人參加組織的，一共二十幾個，於本年二月間分三組出發，每組內設組長及組員等，第一組前往台北·新竹·台中等縣高山區，第二組前往嘉義阿里山一帶，第三組前往花蓮一帶，前後爲期半個月，沿途行程計達五百餘公里。每個組員均歷經艱辛險阻，深人山地，幸所得結果，尙見圓滿，考察歸來，幷綜合各族代表意見，及要求參酌考察實况及心得，加以縝密硏究後，擬具體詳盡的「山地行政設施計劃綱要」爲推行之準繩。</p>
<p>五年計劃　該省長官公署爲扶助山地同胞，提高其文化，改善其生活，俾與平地同胞相等起見，特訂定「台灣省山地行政設施計劃綱要」付諸實施，其中關於設施的對象，步驟等，均有詳盡妥善周密的計劃，幷決以普通行政方式，加强各項設施，暫以五年爲期，實施結果，再繼續第二期之計劃，總期於短短十年之內，使山地同胞之智識水準，與生活能力可與平地人民相同。</p>
<p>七族分佈　山地行政設施的對象，即所謂高山的七族，他們分佈的地域如下：</p>
<p>（一）泰耶爾族—分佈於台北縣之文山，羅東，蘇澳；新竹縣之大溪，竹東，大湖，台中縣之東勢，台中縣之能高及花蓮港之花蓮各區。</p>
<p>（二）不奴族—分佈於能高，新高，花蓮縣之鳳林，玉里；台東縣之台東各區。</p>
<p>（三）茲歐族—分佈於台南縣之嘉義，高雄縣之旗山各區。</p>
<p>（四）拔灣族—分佈於高雄縣之旗山，屛東，潮州，恒春，及台東之台東各區。</p>
<p>（五）阿眉族—分佈於花蓮縣之花蓮，鳳林，玉里，台東縣之新港各區。</p>
<p>（六）亞美族—聚居於台東縣台東區之紅頭嶼。</p>
<p>（七）薩塞多族—聚居於新竹縣之竹南區。</p>
<p>設施步驟　山地行政的計劃旣己確定，而對於行政設施的步驟，亦經過他們縝密審愼的考慮，分別緩急輕重，不壓其詳地訂定如下</p>
<p>（一）組織—由民政處邀集有關各處會局室組織山地施政硏究委員會，從事硏究改進山地各項設施，組織山地施政考察團，從事考察山地實况，綜合硏討以謀改進山地行政之設施。</p>
<p>（二）自治—建設山地自治機構，組織鄕公公所村辦公處，籌辦山地地方自治事業，選舉鄕民代表成立民意機關。</p>
<p>（三）訓練—訓練山地自治工作人員，確立山地人事制度，使其安心服務，提高山地工作人員待遇以鼓勵有志靑年前往服務。</p>
<p>（四）教育—山地各鄕村前日人所辦的「蕃童敎育所」，一律改爲國民學校，並辦理成人敎育，推行國語國文運動，與平地敎育同樣設施，廢除日人歧視山地同胞之制度，以求提高山地同胞文化水準，幷設立中等學校，培育山地靑年，及設公費生獎勵入大學修業。</p>
<p>（五）衛生—山地各鄕村設立衛生所及瘧疾防治所，並由省組織山地巡迴醫療隊，經常施醫，並指導山地同胞衛生常識，促進其體格健康。</p>
<p>（六）合作—指導組織山地鄉村合作社，辦理山地物資供銷業務，使山地同胞經濟組織得以確立，免受商人之剝削，俾得改善其生活。</p>
<p>（七）生產—擴展山地生產事業，設立各縣山地農業講習所，及職業傳習所，培育山地農業專門技術人員，發展山地產業，並改進山地各項手工業，以裕山地同胞之收入。</p>
<p>（八）交通—修建山地·道路·橋樑，便利山地交通。</p>
<p>（九）自衛—爲加强山地自衛力量，訓練山地警察人員，派回山地從事警衛工作，以提高其自衛能力。</p>
<p>（十）風俗—山地同胞風俗習慣，與平地不同，相沿己久，爲種族同化之重要阻礙，其不良風俗與習慣，積極設法改革。</p>
<p>行政組織　爲針對現階段實際情形的需要，並配合五年計劃的推行，以求與平地並行發展，特加强組織，藉期適應需要，而收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>（一）省的方面—最先由省行政長官公署民政處第一科，將前台灣總督府理蕃課業務接收過來，設一山地行政股，主持辦理山地行政事務，有關各單位業務，仍會同配合各處辦理之，最近爲注重山地行政工作的實施，特將原有山地行政股改設第三科辦理，仍配合各處共同工作，以期山地行政與平地行政同樣設施，泯滅過去日本政府歧視之觀念，貫澈民族平等之精神。</p>
<p>（二）縣的方面—在凡有山地同胞聚居之各縣縣政府民政局（科）設山地行政課及山地行政指導員，而區署則由民政課指定人員專責主辦山地行政。</p>
<p>（三）鄕的方面—在各縣山地與平地同樣編組鄕公所，村辦公處，取消過去番社及頭目制度，更將過去警察控制之機關撤銷，以自治行政機關，作積極的管理與輔導。</p>
<p>服務操守　爲加緊推行各縣山地工作起見，又訂定各縣山地工作人員服務規則十七條，其內容對於工作者職務的區別，與操守。權限等，均有明細的釐定，最後明白指出山地工作者所居的地位與重要性，並確定保障其生活，獎勵他們長期繼續服務，（除有違法失職情事外）在任職五年以內，不得見異思遷，請求更調，以期假以時日有所表現，工作者本身，非有正當事由，亦不得任意請假，非經核准不得擅離職守，即准許給假，爲期僅短短三天，超此還要報請民政處核准，於此可見本省當局對於這一班工作者是如何重視，如何嚴密控制，俾他們能刻苦耐勞，始終不懈地，爲山地同胞謀取福利，爲政府推行國策。</p>
<p>扶植民意　山地民意機關，亦與平地同樣籌設，以訓練其自治能力，灌輸其國家民族之意識，現山地同胞均已舉行過公民宣誓，各村則召開村民大會，各鄉則選出鄕民代表，成立鄕民代表會，至於此次台省各縣參議院選舉，山地同胞亦多鼓勵其競選，故當選者，不但縣參議員已有十人之多，即鄕民代表亦達到二百零六人，這個亘古未有之創舉，實爲高山族同胞的無上光榮。</p>
<p>補助經費　推行山地行政各項業務，所需經費支出的數目，雖相當龐大，但台省當局爲着要達到理想的要求，本年度各縣山地行政經費三千九百四十五萬七千八百元（台幣）全部由省庫補助，使一切均能按照計劃進行。</p>
<p>糾正誤解　山地人民因狩獵關係，素喜槍械，據各方情報雖多，惟按目前的民心與事實，尙無儲藏軍火及軌外企圖之跡象，同時該署亦早已迭經令飭各有關縣政府，仍予隨時密切注意，免生意外，而各該縣長對於山地民之歷史，習慣，均甚明瞭，故對於山地設施，也都能審愼處理，關於這一點因外間頗多誤解，故特提出有關的負責人對記者的表示，附帶於此提及。</p>
<p>互相交流　爲着要想第一步做到平地鄕鎭戶籍，而有山地同胞，山地鄕村戶籍，而有平地同胞，第一二步做到各級行政自治上無山地平地之區別，文化經濟上，無山地平地之界限，即語言習慣上，無山地平地之色彩，故該署當局仍計劃逐漸移墾什居，選定墾殖區域，遷移平地之人口，與山地同胞混合居住，共同生產，不過在目前暫時仍限制平地人民入山，以防狡黠之徒，乘機欺騙山地善良民衆。</p>
<p>最後目標　種族之融和混合，最大的關鍵在於「婚姻」，而該省山地行政之最後目標，也就是在逐漸提倡，並鼓勵通婚，破除界限，以期同化於無形，因此將來還要視實際情形，定獎勵章則，以促進山地平地同胞相互通婚，藉以構成中華民族新生的細胞。</p>
<p>工作表現　山地行政推行以來，表現於各方面的工作成績，如各鄉村均普設國民學校，鄕設衛生所，村設瘧疾防治所，縣設農業講習所，現全省計設山地鄉公所三十所，村辦公處一百七十七處，鄕村國民學校一百七十七所，鄉衛生所三十所，村瘧疾防治所一百一十所，又合北，新竹，台中，台南，高雄，台東，花蓮等七縣，各設農業講習所一所，分別展開山地工作，此外指導組織各級合作社，以代替剝奪山地同胞利益之交易，修築道路橋樑，以利便山地交通，均爲積極辦理中之要政，現均已分別次第逐一實現，而台北高雄兩縣山地山地中學兩所，亦在積極籌辦中。</p>
<p>目前山地行政的推行甚見順利，不久的將來，當能見彼輩與平地民衆並肩而立，爲建設三民主義新台灣而共同努力。</p>
<h3>皖東北慘案　本報廿一日蚌埠訊</h3>
<p>— 通訊員　錢夢超</p>
<p>辭處皖省東北的幾縣一向好似是不甚爲人注意的地方，現在這廣大的原野上有兵燹·水災·饑饉·疫癘·不停息的演變，它彷彿像一幅慘絕人寰的畫面。</p>
<p>這裏听說皖東北幾縣，是指近年被共軍所盤踞竄擾的地區，最好先以洪澤湖爲中心點；所謂皖東北就是：指着湖濱外圍的盱眙·天長·五河·泗縣·靈璧等縣，，讀者不要小覷了這偏僻的小縣份，盱眙原是楚懷王孫心—義帝建都的一座山城，而靈璧就是西楚霸王項羽被漢高祖圍殲的垓下所在地，縣城東還有値得憑弔的處置墓。</p>
<p>洪澤湖濱不堪話當年</p>
<p>緊瀕近洪澤湖的地區，一向是港汶交錯，蘆葦攢叢，過去眞如平劇中的落馬湖，堪稱爲盜賊淵藪。湖裏菱藕滋生，魚蝦繁殖，若値承平時期，水利富饒，物產豐足，居民衣食有了辦法，那個又甘願去伏莽匿萑，作梁山泊的生活呢！</p>
<p>湖的外圍，川原漭瀁，四望澒洞，土壤膏腴之區，農業特別的發達，這裏有帶着封建意味的大地主，佃戶是地主的農奴。太平之世，他們豐衣足食，無憂寡慮，有些地方，眞是「田疇相望雞犬相聞，老死不相往來，」在這誠樸的農村社會裏，是不足以爲異的。現在呢，八百餘萬的人民，在這皖省的東北角上已不勝共軍的壓迫，戰爭的摧殘，貪汚的敲吸，災祲的侵襲，疫癘的折磨。大多在飢餓綫上掙扎，在流亡道上轉徙過着非人類的生活。</p>
<p>無辜人民被驅作砲灰</p>
<p>盤踞在盱·天·五泗·靈城鎭和鄉村的共軍，簡眞就是世界上的魔王，他們對於所謂「解放區」裏人民，是血腥的統治，沒有絲毫民主的氣氛，一年來殺的殺，綁的綁，鬥爭有似惡作劇，找租又似閒開心，弄得老百姓像熱鍋上的螞蟻，團團四轉，找不着出路；不料霹靂一聲，蘇北戰事爆發，共軍結集了五六萬，國軍開到了好幾師，在溽署氛圍裏，砲火連天，人民在槍聲機影下，打死餓死的，眞是不可勝數。記者的故里，原僻處蘇皖交界的一座小小村落裏，不料上月被戰火燃及，村裏居民被砲彈傷了十二名，記者的堂弟婦和堂姪，兒母，子同遭炸斃，此外弟姪輩，受傷後到徐州醫治的，還有好幾個。</p>
<p>五河共軍縣長王亞籖，爲阻制國軍調動，首先挖掘淮隄，淹灌農田，破壞道路，因此五河城外遽成澤國。靈璧南鄉共軍，則破壞澮河隄岸，以資策應，因澮河爲淮河支流，澮河決口，淮河亦不能不稍受影饗。</p>
<p>宿縣亦爲皖東北縣份之一，縣城爲津浦綫南綫之一中等站，勝利後，即由國軍駐守，但共軍則出沒四鄕，不時威脅交通，且委有縣長鄭懷丹，協助徵糧，迫使抗幣，偽縣府則設於睢溪口，近因國軍進剿，除此擊彼竄聲東攻西外，日前突在宿縣永城交界的缺佛寺，界首店，閻橋等處，將各河隄壩予以掘破，其中之巴河，水勢泛濫，平地水深三四尺不等，加以雲雨爲災，蝗蟲爲害宿西一帶面積約十公里地帶的民衆，哭聲震野，慘不忍聞。</p>
<p>黄汎東瀉後，淮河水勢陡漲，本日（二十一）此間水位，已漲至二〇，一九公尺，超過二十年最高洪水位二〇，一七公尺紀錄，沿淮隄壩，冲毀甚多，本埠市內瀕河地區，已被水浸灌，經一路水深沒踝，如淮水再續漲不已，蚌埠將有陸沉之虞，防汎機關，正加緊堵禦。附近各縣鎭，旣在天災人禍之下，此間商業乃大受影響，市面蕭條，營業冷淡，完全爲不景氣的陰影所籠罩，長此以往，工商業將陷於崩潰的深淵，商會已推派代表晋京請願，進行工商貸款，希望數目，至少需五十萬萬元，方克挽此危局。</p>
<p>幸經國軍奮勇猛攻，在浴血肉搏的場面下，次第收復了天·盱·泗·五·靈五縣。當共軍在靈璧剛要撤退的時候曾於城廂內外，遍埋地雷，以冀傷害我入城軍民，國軍入城後，先後搜索，掘出百餘枚，因一時不慎，西門內爆炸一枚，死一老嫗，南門外爆炸一枚，傷一小孩，共黨之殘忍有如此者。</p>
<p>五縣兵燹之後，眞是瘡痍滿目，城區遍地瓦礫，鄉間一片荒凉，孑遺戰後歸來，棲食都成問題，「田園寥落干戈後，骨肉流離道路中」，不啻爲皖東北現狀的寫照。</p>

<h3>張炎茂之遇刺</h3>
<p>河南省黨部書記長張炎茂氏，在汴遇刺身殉，各方極爲關切。當局亦正分頭緝兇偵尋原委。茲據査悉：七月五日張氏曾接匿名恐嚇信一封內稱：「啓者，面不相識，實在不套，近來小弟奉命刺兄，不得而已。可是拿良心來說，不是小弟帮忙，就是十個也槍打了。望兄看條設法離汴，弟已飭三五人將兄東夫認眞，或改坐汽車可也，免走舊路爲盼。日後見面再談罷。小弟塗紙，」等語。張氏接信後，同志咸勸留意，氏以獻身革命奔走四方，數十年來，即在出生入死中度日，初不爲動。嗣後，昆明李聞案相繼發生，友朋勸勉益切，僉以今日政治局勢，逈非往昔，野心之徒，正欲製造紛亂，掀起風波，以圖震撼社會，增加中央困難，矧豫中局面，特爲惡劣，而自君（指張氏）來省，使彼好亂之徒，桎梏難逞，積恨旣久，可能出此狠毒。議喩再三，請其珍重。氏則向以和平談判爲全國人士所渴望，而環顧內外，震盪阽危，和平團結，應已爲明達有識者所共同追求，野心者縱懷異志，似或不致出此，且吾輩革命黨人，義當爲民前鋒，時際艱處，不能撥亂反正，而乃逃危避難，隱忍偸生，私心自問，亦足羞慚，果有意外，即使殉職，庶幾無愧，豈能苟免？同志心雖謂危，終不能廻其意。及周恩來至汴，視察黄河堵口工程，氏對和平前途，信念益篤，而於本身安危，益不捎意。詎周氏廿一日離汴，而氏廿三日晨即犧於難，各方於此，悲憤已極，董氏生平事績，磊落轟烈，實有足爲一般反抗中央懷抱政治野心之流所深深嫉忌者。茲更遠其大略。以供關心本案者之參證。</p>
<p>氏字芷靑，河南飯師人，生於民元前七年，三歲失恃，自幼刻苦自勵，而岐異沉雄，隱懷大志。十九歲畢業於河南省立第四師範，執敎飯師縣立高小。當時國內革命空氣濃厚，氏受政治思潮之薰陶，傾心於革命建國，而於中山先生之政治主張，尤為崇仰，逐於十六年加入國民黨，北伐軍甫抵武漢，即潛入豫中，秘密組訓民衆，策動響應，一時各地風從。平漢綫軍事，因得迅速推進。十七年入中央黨務學校，努力於革命原理之探討。適北伐軍進至魯省，中樞爲加强宣傳，氏奉派隨第九軍北上，專任宣傳工作，軍次濟南，而五三慘案發生，格於外交環境，乃復隨軍回京，完成黨校課業，於時開封地方黨務選舉，氏膺選常委，從事黨的訓練工作，殫竭精誠，極收宏效，旋感雜說飛起，政論紛紜，靑年思想缺乏領導，乃轉入豫省敎界，先後執敎於省立一中，省立一師，及靜泉中學，兼理訓導，中原靑年，因得深受三民主義之陶冶。</p>
<p>廿一·二年間，日人侵察綏甚急，氏乃北上，主編西北公論，從事文化抗敵，以發揚民族文化，喚醒民族意識爲職志，正論伸張，敵人側目。二十四年，察省黨務被迫撤退，乃返中央黨部，服務十年，迭任艱危，建樹燦然。三十三年冬，華北敵勢猶張，中原戰事，迭遭挫折，氏默察癥結，實由地方民衆，組訓未力，乃毅然請調地方服務，於卅四年三月，出任豫省黨部書記長。蒞任以後，經綸擘劃，百廢皆舉，而同志之間，翕然無間，一反過去紛錯之局，因之民力蔚起，軍民協調，中原抗敵力量，日見雄健蓬勃。</p>
<p>勝利以還，軍事復員，井然有序，實皆氏組訓民衆深得潛力爲之樹基，異類銜恨，益入骨髓。年餘以來，時思一逞，匿名恫嚇函件，已不一見，氏皆置之不顧，乃最近一函，果售奸謀，在氏畢生奮鬥，忠黨愛國，死重泰山，固已無憾，而張氏以壯年遽遭摧折，實國家之捐失。至張氏生平，不事生產遺妻侯松齡女士，子震龍·震雷·女琯·孤露無依，蕭條身後，殊足令人起同情之哀感！（中央社開封訊）</p>
<h3>動盪中的「行總</h3>
<p>— 」本報記者平齋</p>
<p>（上接第八版）</p>
<p>大家「權宜」一下，「近水樓台先得月」起來，於是偏處在內地如湖南，河南，廣西等省的災民就永遠祗能挨着餓呆等。交通如果不能解決，他們「等」的機會就越多。</p>
<p>聯總駐華辦事處二百多個外國職員指摘我國辦救濟有政治歧視的傾向。但是行總和周恩來商談之順利可以證明了這種指摘顯然和事實有相當距離。可是，以後這種不愉快的事情能不能從此不再發生呢？我想，每一個關心行總和聯總的人士恐怕都不敢確切說一句，「從此沒有事了」。</p>
<p>人是政治的動物，誰也免不了有點偏見。「聯總」駐華辦事處裏的職員，不同的國籍有二十二個之多，他們有些是學者，專家，軍人，還有不少以前租界時代上海工部局裏的「老上海」，「中國通」。各人背景不同，思想自然也就不同。猶太人與非猶太人之間的磨擦。旣相當劇烈，「門戶之見」也着實深刻。奧姆斯丹德和賴氏之間的感情不能融洽，更是人所共知的事實，這樁事情和拉伽第亞的暴跳如雷也恐怕不無關係，結果倒是對中國來一個停運令，「殃及」了無辜的「池魚」。可見照目前這種情勢，「客卿」們要「脫離政治」旣決無可能，「一心一德」也不像會得實現。如果周恩來要求派人參加行總各部門）事居然實現，那是「行總」裏面政治空氣之濃厚，恐怕將在全中國各機關中佔第一位了。</p>
<p>「行總是一只將沉的船，然而我們要幹好它」。一位行總裏的高級負責人對我這樣說。</p>
<p>照目前的情形說，實在使人不能不對行總感到最大的關切了。這只「船」會不會「沉」，當然還在未定之天，然而時間太迫促了，而驚浪駭濤却實在太多！</p>
<p>主持的人，都是第一流的人才。蔣廷黻先生不但有遠見，而且有魄力，對聯總的交涉更是極盡了縱橫裨闔之能事。負責執行的劉鴻生先生也是在各種事業上飽經風浪的「老手」，辦起事來毫不拖泥帶水。一般幹部也可說是在水準以上的，很有幾個極幹練富朝氣的人才。</p>
<p>計劃也相當完備，而且都相當切合實際。</p>
<p>行總如果失敗，這失敗的原因是值得我們深長思慮的。我們討論行總，當然不能把行總和中國的政治脫離了來看，如果政治不上軌道，却偏要行總單獨成功，這就未免類乎刻舟求鵠，很少成功之望。行總工作的性質，需要和各部會緊密合作的地方最多，即以交通而論，目前物資運輸之困難，固然由於政治原因者爲多，但是，有許多交通之未能暢通，却並不在於有人破壞，例如京秔國道，粵漢線，為甚麼在勝利已達一年的今日，還沒有好好修復？財政方面，行政院也沒有給行總多少帮助，政府所撥的四千三百二十億元善後救濟基金，數目雖然着實不小，而這筆預算雖係行總所造，行政院却早把這筆錢分配給交通部，水利委員會………等等部會去了，結果是編造預算的機關，自己倒一文也沒有收到！最近雖已費盡九牛二虎之力，偕到了八百億，但這八百億又祗佔了原預算中的幾成呢？說出賣物資罷，行總是和行政院談妥了出賣幾成才定聲請接濟的數量的，可是出賣的時候，行政院往往又自已先借了款子，買了同樣的物資到市塲上來拋售，結果不是貨物供過於求，無人過問，就是行總祗好等行政院賣完了再賣。即使如此，拋售物資對遏止通貨膨漲也已經起了極大的決定性的作用。然而行總在這種情形之下要能發揮最高度的效率，却實在戛戛乎其難了。</p>
<p>再說供應物資的聯總罷，固然這四十幾個友邦肯抱已溺溺人之心，來帮助我國，實在很可感謝，然而也還是有「口惠而實不至」的情形，答應給你的東西，實際上往往祗給你三成五成，有時忽然中斷兩三個月再來，有時你不需要的東西倒送了來，你需要得最急的偏又沒有。中國的善後救濟固然有很詳細完備的計劃，而他們的接濟却並不配合這個計劃。中國全不適用的大機器堆滿了上海的倉庫，結果反是聯總下了停運物資的命令，說是倉庫出淸得太慢！</p>
<p>最近，國內的烽火又起，行總河南分署的工作人員已有死傷，工作推進當然更難，而事實上善後救濟的需要却又更爲迫切。歲月不居，再有幾個月可以拿到物資呢？羅斯福總統的一個很偉大的理想，似乎是不容易實現的了。</p>

<h3>上海夏殘</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>立秋已經過了好幾天，雖然暑氣未消，但是上海勝利後的第一個夏天，終於已成尾聲了。去年的夏天，上海人正抱着無限興奮而緊張的心理，傾聽着一聲聲凄厲的空襲警報。沉重的機聲來了，便靜靜地諦聽着轟炸的方向，數着炸彈的數目。有時玻璃窗給彈風激碎，臥室裏跳進了一塊兩塊彈片，然而，大家的心裏並沒有怨恨，相反的，大眾都在期侍着馬上就要來的反攻！</p>
<p>第一次盟軍的飛機轟炸了上海郊外機場之後，敵偽的報紙出版了一尺左右見方的小張號外，貼滿了電綫木桿。敵人的用意也許是想引起上海老百姓們的憤恨，然而，許許多多留在上海的中國人對着這張號外說的話却是，「祗要勝利，炸死我也不要緊」！</p>
<p>勝利了。去年作為戒嚴地區的　家宅公園裏，今年擠滿了遊客。虹口——去年沒有人敢去的地方，今年在游泳池裏，許多人正逍遙地過着清凉的片刻。上海漸漸蘇醒過來了。</p>
<p>民國三十五年的夏天，上海也許還有幾件特別值得紀念的事情：第一件是今夏下了機場大雨，馬路成為澤國；第二件是今憂上海舉行了一次「小姐」和「皇后」的競選，目的是為了救濟災民。但願馬路早早修好，以後不要再有水患；但願選舉小姐皇后的「票資」早入難民手裏，不要老是在經手人的手裏打轉！</p>
<h3>「園遊會」，在今年的夏天，也特別盛行。</h3>
<h3>今夏的幾場大雨，馬路成了澤國。</h3>
<h3>為蘇北難民舉行了一次「小姐」和「皇后」的競選。</h3>
<h3>消遙在遊泳池裏</h3>
<h3>復興公園——顧家宅公園——裏擠滿了遊客</h3>
<h3>今年的夏天，虹口遊泳池裏擠滿了人。</h3>
<h3>年青的小姐們，在公園裏過着愉快的夏天。</h3>
<h3>夏令營，在上海也舉辦了幾處，她們興奮的過着樂園生活。</h3>

<h3>柕聲下的呻吟（小說）</h3>
<p>— 廉鍔</p>
<p>初秋的天氣，悶熱得非凡，尤其是中午，更是令人煎熬不住！抬頭望望天，天空中正滿佈着密密的烏　，誰都料得到驟雨立刻就會倒下來的。</p>
<p>十二點鐘吃中飯的「回聲」剛拉過，矗立在滬西小沙渡路××布廠的水泥烟囱，正冒着濃烟，裊裊的向天空中的烏雲挨近去，一團團的上昇，上昇，便混入雲層裏去了。</p>
<p>從工塲裏怱怱地跑出來十幾個女工，她們都異口同聲地說：「啊！怎麽辦？我的套鞋雨傘可沒有帶來啊！」說着便一同跑入飯應去了。</p>
<p>這時候，飯廳上已擠滿了人，大家都爭光恐後的向熱水龍頭去泡飯、熱水龍頭可眞也不掙氣，雖然一排有十幾隻，但除了頭二三隻龍頭裏放出來的水，還令人滿意外，其餘的都少得可憐，到了末二只，簡直像病婦的奶水般擠也擠不出了。</p>
<p>秀英是剛來工作的新工人，只得事事讓老工人佔先，但她心里眞在着急：今天的布不能再織得少了，剛才拿摩溫王大姐嚴厲的面目又浮現在眼前了她眞怨這二天的紗斷頭特別多，好好地又會碰到「飛梭」，叫機匠來修，又耽誤了好些時間，現在限看別的同伴多已吃了飯進工塲了，而自己的飯還沒有泡着，心中一急，便索性不等了，胡亂地吃了些冷飯就走向工塲。</p>
<p>雨果然如每個人預期般傾鴻下來，而且愈下愈大，到五點鐘還沒有停，每個工人都擔心着回家的一段路，只有秀英却擔憂着布織得比咋天還少，等會兒怎向拿摩溫交代？而機匠却時時來獻股勤，瞎三話四的眞討厭！</p>
<p>機匠是工塲裏的拿摩土，誰也不敢得罪他，就是王大姐也要讓他三分，小飯桶（註　）也不敢惹他的。</p>
<p>秀英也只好同他敷衍，當他知道秀英恐懼布織得過少要被女工頭解雇之事，便向秀英擔保，他可向王大姐去說的。</p>
<p>秀英終算仗了機匠的說項，平平穩穩的做了一星期。</p>
<p>機械的文明，一方面給人們帶來了物質的享受，一方面却給人們帶來了更多的不幸，不過不幸的却同秀英一般命運的人，做了一星期的日班，現在要臨到做夜工了。</p>
<p>做夜工也是實足的十二小時工作，除了午夜十二時十幾分鐘吃飯外，當車（註二）的女工，是一分鐘也不容偸懶的。</p>
<p>秀英當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>噴霧機一刻不停的噴着水沫，工塲裏滿是人造的霧，二百餘台布機軋軋的繁聲，簡直要把人們的耳膜震破，秀英全神貫注的注意着梭子在經綫裏穿來穿去。</p>
<p>現在她因機匠的關係，王大姐已派給她二台布機了，一個技術還不十分熟練的新工人，就給她同時管理二台布機，眞是天大面子；因爲她們的工資是以布織得多寡來計算的，多管一台布機，布當然可以多織些，可是人也當然要比管一台布機忙得多了。</p>
<p>工廠主是最斤斤於機械的生產力的，所以女工們雖然做着「自家生活」，但若所織的量不够標準，仍要加以干涉的——罰工錢，取消賞工，開除……都在廠規上規定着。</p>
<p>秀英管了二台布機，心裏雖然十分高興，但也十分恐懼，她想工資領到後，可給爸買一瓶魚肝油了，幾年來爸在一個私立中學裏敎書，眞是太吃力，不賺錢了。</p>
<p>整天的辛勞，整夜的咳嗽，弄得他已骨瘦如柴，肺病看看要入第三期了，但爲了生活，他還在拼着命。</p>
<p>媽雖只四十幾歲，可是也折磨到像六十幾歲的老太婆了；身體衰弱得不能長時期工作，可是她却整天强撑着不肯休息，事實上也實在不容她休息啊！</p>
<p>弟弟在初中唸書，同爸都要回來吃飯，小妹妹年紀太小還不能相帮，什麽都要媽一手料理。</p>
<p>但當她想到時時停車接頭的躭誤時間，又未免惕然憂心了。</p>
<p>罪惡似乎與黑夜有不可分離的　　，都市裏多少罪惡都在黑夜裏發生；即使在都市的另一角也會有罪惡在滋長着。</p>
<p>當秀英正在接頭的當見，機匠却悄悄地溜到她的背後，輕輕的對她說：</p>
<p>「明朝三點鐘，到我家來白相！」</p>
<p>「不，我媽是不准我出來。」</p>
<p>「你說廠裏明天開會好了。」</p>
<p>「不，我要睡覺啊！」</p>
<p>「我的家裏也有床啊！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>第二天晚上，秀英仍舊在織着布，可是心裏終是忐忑不安，機匠惡狠狠的目光，老是在眼前恍惚着。</p>
<p>突然布機停了，秀英急忙去推動開關，可是任你怎樣開也沒有用，她知道是出了毛病了，只得找機匠來修理；機匠來了，他先把機輪卸下，慢慢的用布揩擦，……這樣的過了半小時，秀英實在等得不耐煩了，問機匠還有多少時侯可以修好，機匠便回答道：</p>
<p>「你明朝十二點鐘能够出來？現在立刻就可修好，否則，今夜恐怕修不成了！」</p>
<p>「嗯！」</p>
<p>「我們明天大世界去好嗎？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>機械的生活是再刻版不過的，每天接頭，卸布，上紗……天天老是這一套，秀英倒也習慣於這一些了。今夜因爲白天同機匠玩了一下半天，到了午夜二點鐘可再也支撑不了，二隻眼睛只想合攏來，呵欠連連打個不停。</p>
<p>機匠也知道秀英是支撑不了的，現在瞧見了她困倦欲睡的樣子，便跑過來對她說：</p>
<p>「你到更衣室去睏一覺吧！你的布明晨我可以代你向別的女工處借一些的。」</p>
<p>秀英實在受不住睡魔的侵迫，只得點點頭表示同意了。</p>
<p>更衣室是女工上班下班時換衣服的處所，除了「交班」時特別熱鬧外，其餘的時間，老是上着鎖的，它的鑰匙是交拿摩溫保管着，別的人是不能隨便進去的。</p>
<p>現在因爲機匠的關係，秀英却能公然的去「揩油」（註三）了。</p>
<p>當秀英睡眼惺忪醒來的時候，她覺得有股熱力在她週身交流着，她想掙扎，可是沒有力氣，她只能任憑蹂躪，任憑宰割到他認爲滿足的時侯。</p>
<p>她想聲張，可是又不敢聲張，她想她的一生是完了，想到這裏，她便哭了，哭聲很低很低的，她恐怕被人聽見了笑話，所以啜泣了些時候，她便抆乾了眼淚，整一整頭髮走出了更衣室，在車弄中她遇見了王大姐，便漲紅着臉低着頭，很快的走到自己的車旁，她雖逃避了王大姐對她注視的目光，但這雙分明含着嫉妬和無可奈何的眼睛，她却瞧得很淸楚，於是她的心裏更明白了，但明白了又有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>半個月之後，天仍舊很悶熱，秀英依然很忙碌的在織着布，機械的繁聲一些不起變化的軋不休，噴霧機也仍在噴着雨絲般的濃霧，一切顯得很平靜，也很經常。</p>
<p>老天似乎專揀好欺的人來欺侮似的，在這平靜經常的氣氛中忽然起了一陣騷動；大家都停了車向秀英的布機瞧去，只見秀英滿臉是血，昏倒地上，原來是秀英身旁的一台布機飛了梭，這二頭鑲着尖銳的鐵的梭子，被「打手棒」（註四）彈了出來，不偏不倚的正射在秀英的太陽穴上，把秀英痛得昏了過去。</p>
<p>在秀英醒過來的時候，她已臥在××勞工醫院了，醫院裏靜靜的，一些雜聲都沒有，但是秀英的腦神經裏却仍響着機械的煩聲！</p>
<p>她只覺得她的頭要被這聲音震裂了，所以起了一陣陣的劇痛，於是她痛苦地呻吟着。</p>
<p>但是杼聲下的呻吟是微弱的，只有同秀英一樣命運的人，才能聽得淸楚這樣微弱的呻吟，所以現在秀英痛苦的呻吟，也只有讓她自己一人靜靜的去領略了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風12</p>
<p>「累…？又不是城裏的娘兒們」。他到底感覺到受了些許輕微的侮辱。「再饒上三個這們多，不是也得走嗎，老伯」？聲音還掛着些兒童的尖嫩，說話的能度，却是那麽老氣。</p>
<p>關于吃，不拘吃什麼，精的，　的，也不管時間，祇須稍爲讓他一下，他無不歡迎，而且吃得相當的多。十二三歲的人，雖說瘦了些，可有五尺二三吋高，比我只低了一二吋。根據普通的說法，他這時芷在「扯條了」，　是胖不了，可是要吃。</p>
<p>一會兒，在通過電話，安排了一些零碎事，帶上了我的公事手槍，上前屋子去，小老虎可還在吃。一見我進了屋子，知道要動身了，便離了座位，向屋子的幾個同志吿了辭；大叔，大哥，喊了一陣，順便把桌子的一個小布口袋撈在手裏。看樣子，是大叔大哥們給他預備的一袋觸。</p>
<p>「你剛才打那一條路來的」？剛出了院子，我想知道一些路上的情形。這時東，東北，大槪每兩三分鐘有一聲大砲，夾着些重機關槍。西北比較平靜，但也有槍聲。這都是警戒姿態，並非正式接觸。</p>
<p>「走這邊來」，仙指着西北角上，「我撓了好幾個灣子，走的小路」。他的步子，仍舊那麽輕鬆。</p>
<p>西北角這條路我沒走過，聽說要擦過盧溝撟，繞過幾座小山，經過田村，八里莊，走西直門或廣安門進城。這麽一走，就算不繞道，也有七八十里地。</p>
<p>「老伯，您可願意瞧點熱鬧」？小老虎放慢了步子，偏過頭來瞧着我。</p>
<p>「好孩子，咱們今天不是有要緊的事嗎？……」我知道他的小心眼在搗什麼鬼，「要瞧熱鬧，往後可多着呢」。</p>
<p>「那麽，咱們得翻過這條小山埂子，抄那邊小道，奔西便門——可是鬼都礎不見一個」。</p>
<p>「行，咱們祇要近，快，沒麻煩，礎不見鬼更好……」瞧他很有禮貌的報起了嘴，我祇好鼓勵他一句，「你瞧，過一天得閒，咱們爺兒倆，還不能去找鬼子鬧牠一陣」？</p>
<p>他很開心的笑了；「老伯，您眞『有種』。……　大伯，寨子裏的大伯，也眞有種，過不了十天半月，就要去打一回游擊。您知道，鬼子吃的玩意兒可多着哪」；他把手上的一袋子鑣舉起來，嚥了一口涶沫，「這東西，他們不吃，吃的都是麵包，鐵罐子牛肉，大米團子……咱們一回就得擄他一大堆，還有槍杆子，小銃，什麼的」。</p>
<p>聽他提到山寨子，我聯想到這孩子的傳奇故事：</p>
<p>「你今年幾歲了」？</p>
<p>「肖虎，十三哪……紀姨給我算算，說祗能算十二歲，我也鬧不淸」。紀姨就是紀耀羣。</p>
<p>「聽說你練的玩藝不錯……？</p>
<p>「沒什麼……八卦對子，打椿，　陽掌，達摩功，擒拿手，氣功還沒練好」。</p>
<p>「練了多少年了」？</p>

<h3>詩談片</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>詩是感情最美的節奏，言語的昇華，文字表現最好藝術的手法。</p>
<p>感情的表現不限於文字和言語；音樂家把心靈編入曲譜，讓神經跳盪在飛揚的音符之問。畫家把生命拌入油彩，抓住瞬刻，把飄忽的光彩保特至永遠。藝術包括文學，文學是言語的藝術，而詩則是文學的語言。以是，詩也同於一切的藝術，具辦藝術所必具的條件，經特殊藝術方法的處理，表現出來。</p>
<p>詩比須是「美」的，美不是瑰奇，奪目的雲霞祇給人以瞬時的眩惑。美不是矞麗，輝煌的宮殿祇閉鎖一屋子　　，「美」的價値在乎永遠，必須保持着不朽的光輝。「美」的意義重在本質，不徒屬於形式的領域。「美」必須是「眞」的，海市蜃樓的成因，還不過是眞實事物的反映，「眞」建築在「現實」。詩的「眞」便是將現實的面目通過詩人主觀的形像，反映到詩的語眞實上。因此，「眞」的詩必須要有一副生活的骨幹。「美」必須是「善」的，歷史的進展便是「善」與「惡」搏鬥的勝利，美的理想安排在前面，人必須循苦難的途徑追趕，「善」指示以必然的方向，因此，「善」的詩必然與歷史的進步踏着同一的調子。詩的「美」旣不僅是文字，節奏，言語，形式的美，還當包括本質上「眞」與「善」的美，詩應該是先知者靈魂醒覺的呼喊，充滿着崇高的偉大的希望，顯示出人類生活理想的樂園，詩必須歌頌痛苦，作壓抑在對建勢力與社會環境之下的有力的申訴。詩必須歌頌戰鬥，揭示出人類歷史的進展和解放。『美』不能沒有條件，「美」不能沒有代價，我並不非議單純的自然美，但在人類生活的途徑中，「美」却是掙扎的最後目標。詩人必須以醒覺的靈魂，崇高的感情，揉和現實，創造出融和的「美」的旋律。</p>
<p>詩是文學中最洗鍊的形象的語言。一塊粗糙的生鐵，經過一千次鍜鍊，一千次　擊，才能成就堅韌的鋼鐵，語言是鑛砂，必須在激流之間冲洗，一千担鐵砂淘不出數担純砂，對於現實的情感和意欲，欲作眞實的雕塑，必須揀取最洗鍊的語言，精鍊揚棄渣滓，保存下一切精華，豐富的生活情調，雄渾的音樂節奏，壯　繪畫的色彩，和强烈的思想概念。渣滓的成分是龐雜的，但一切都歸於無用，精華質量是微細的，但槪括着一切的價値，詩的精鍊便得含蓄着無窮意味。</p>
<p>詩不是畫，畫也不是詩。昔人有話，說是：「詩中有畫，畫中有詩。」前者說明詩的表現美，後者說明書的情緒美·詩和畫之間畢竟因表現工具的不同，而有顯著的區別；詩不是散文，散文也不是詩，詩的形式和結構却常帶着濃厚的散文性，散文的描寫和形象也有着豐富的詩的節奏，詩與散文却因相向的工具而劃不出明確的界限。詩不是音樂·音樂不是詩，但詩必須是現實手指挑動心靈的琴弦，所奏出的一支鳴奏曲；包含了音韻的和諧，情感的節奏，涵義的旋律，以及抒情的調門。藝術的表現有着不可界限的共通性，而詩在言語的藝術——文學的部門中，比較地是更富於生命的直接的語言</p>
<h3>讀暴風雨</h3>
<p>— 矯治·吉辛著·馬御風譯</p>
<p>今天我讀了「暴風雨」，這或者是我最喜愛的戲劇。因爲我自以爲已經十分了解牠，平常我總是只翻開了書而不去讀牠。但，關於沙士比亞常常是這樣的，如果再讀牠一次，我就覺得我自己的智識不完全，超過於我所想像的。一個人即使怎樣長命，也將是這樣。一個人只要還有翻動書頁的氣力，和讀牠的心情時，將永遠是這樣。</p>
<p>我喜歡相信這是詩人最後的作品，是他在斯杜來福德的家裏寫的，他每天在少年時代敎給他愛好英國田園的田野裏散步。這是最高的想像力所結的圓熟的果子，大師手裏的完善無缺的妙品。由於沙士比亞在語言的運用上巧妙自如，勝過其他偉大的人的一切業績，僅這一點，對於以研究英語爲畢生之業的人，還有什麽愉快可以和牠相比擬？我能够想像得出，在「暴風雨」裏他特別感覺得這種力量，當難以模擬的適當的言詞，和有無比的韻律的短語從他的守護神哀利爾（譯者註：是該劇中的妖精）。口裏向他囁囁地說出時，他一邊微笑着，一邊寫着。他言語好像是和嬉戲，以發見新的手法來自娛。從帝王到乞丐，一切的階級，一切的精神狀態的人，都從他的口裏說出來。他講過仙境的傳說，現在他創造不是人也不是妖精，而是野獸和人之間的東西，爲了牠的目的，賦給牠語言。這些語言，怎樣涵蘊着化育萬物的濕地的芬芳，和不能上升到地面上來的生物的生命啊！我們不十分去想牠。因爲我們的鑑賞不足，我們限制我們的驚異。雖然奇蹟在我們面前展開，我們幾乎不去注意牠。和我們幾乎不去考察自然界的其他的奧妙一樣，我們的心已經習慣了。</p>
<p>「暴風雨」裏含有在一切戲劇中最崇高的瞑想的句子，這些句子纔是沙士比亞的最後的人生觀的表現，是想總括哲學的敎旨的人不能不引用的文章。其中還有他的最美麗的抒情詩，最溫柔的情話，和一個仙境的景象，牠凌駕「仲夏夜之夢」的最高的美—我不能不這樣想。像甫羅斯別羅對「山丘，小河，平靜的湖水，林蔭裘的妖精」的吿別詞，也是奇蹟，這些句子是百讀不厭的，你每次去讀牠時，牠是永遠新鮮，好像剛從詩人的頭腦裏造出來的一樣。因為牠是天衣無縫的作品，所以像發現了缺點而生厭倦的感覺，是不會有的。想把牠的優點完全吸盡，等到下次翻閱時就沒有刺激的興味，這樣的事情永遠做不到。</p>
<p>生在英國使我覺得可喜的許多理由之中，第一應該數到的，是我用祖國的語言來讀沙士比亞。如果我假想我自己不能直接知道他，僅從遠處聽見他說話，僅以通過勤勞的智力學來的語言，纔能去接觸他的生動的靈魂，一種失望的冷感和凄凉的喪失的心情，便向我製來。我常常以爲我能够讀荷馬，而實際上，如果有喜歡他的人，那就是我了。但我能够一下子就夢想荷馬會將他的一切妙樂傳給我嗎？又他的語言，對於我也和對於希臘光樂時代在海邊散步的人一樣嗎？我知道，經過了時間的大流，我所得到的，只是弱微的，破碎的反響而已。又我知道，這是世界大古時代的光榮的景象，如果不和靑春的記憶混在一起，牠就更加弱微了。讓一切的國土有牠的詩人而得到喜樂，因爲詩人就是國土，是本國的一切偉大和美，是人人生死之地的，一切難以傳遞的遺產。掩卷時我爲愛和崇敬所支配。是我的整個心兒傾倒於這個偉大的魔術師呢？還是他把他的符咒安置在這個島國呢？我不知道。我不能把這兩件東西個別地分開來考察。在被「聲中之聲」（譯者註：是沙翁的詩句）所喚醒的愛和崇敬之中，沙士比亞和英國已經變爲渾然一體了。</p>

<h3>留額金與收據　學店怪事</h3>
<p>— 田楓</p>
<p>昨天由小明的書包裏找到了一張留額金的收據，便想起了這張留額金收據的故事。</p>
<p>小明於上學期沒有學期考試以前的三四天回來說：「校長先生對我們說，現在快將放學了，你們假使下學期仍舊要到這裏來讀書的話，在本學期內須繳留額金一千五百元元；否則取消學額。」我爲要保留小明學額起見，就給他一千五百元，叫他去繳給校長先生，小明吃了飯，就拿了一千五百元很高興的到校裏去了，在五點鐘的時候，小明背了書包一跳跳的回來了，他放下了書包，在書包裏翻來翻去，拿出了一包小小的紙包，我以爲是一張留額金的收據，把它拆開一看，出於我意外，仍舊是一千五百元的二張法幣。我便問小明爲什麼不繳留額金，小明不用考慮的並很提起精神的說「級任先生叫我們不要繳。他說，這是要繳到校長袋袋裏去的。假使校長給留額金收據的話，那麽你們去繳好了，若不給收據的，你不要繳。結果，校長說沒有收據，所以我沒有繳，仍舊把它帶了回來。」</p>
<p>我聽了小明的話，很覺得奇怪，想留額金是保留學生學額的，並且須於下學期學費內扣除的，為什麽要繳到校長袋袋裏去的？眞使我丈二和尙，摸不到頭腦。一直等到星期六了，我想今天是小明學校裏繳留額金最後的一天了，我又給了一千五百元給小明，叫他去將留額金繳了。小明帶了一千五百元去了，結果仍舊沒有繳。我便問小明，你是不是本學期成績不好，要留級，所以不繳留額金，想　到別的學校裏去嗎？小明再三的說不是。我極不解，因而在星期日的上午去拜訪小明的級任先生。這位先生是我要好的同學，他就把這留額金的故事講給我聽了：</p>
<p>這位校長先生終日在錢裏打圈子，這次校長爲充私費，並討好敎師，所以想出用「尊師獻金」名義向學生收留額金。一方面分點給敎師，一方面不給收據。但是敎師不甘受校長利用，因此就叫學生非有收據，不繳留額金。</p>
<p>原來如是，我明白了。</p>
<h3>冷</h3>
<p>— 葉惠民</p>
<p>科學常識</p>
<p>「冷」—在幾年前尙視爲人類生命之一害，現在却用來挽救性命了，在此次大戰中，就發明了冰凍麻醉，通常稱爲「麻痺手術」，不僅麻痺，甚且毫無痛苦，不須另外服藥也不會流血。</p>
<p>冷氣降了人類生命的活力，當身體中有某一部份溫度减低近乎冰點時，體內的細胞與細菌都暫時停止活動。</p>
<p>從前當兵士在戰塲上受傷後，往往用止血器來按時輸入氧氣到器管裏去。每次止血器都滲出許多的血而引起毒物進入體內，在冰凍中，就不須要止血器的麻煩。因爲那時體內的細胞都不活動而且不須要氧氣，兵士固能吸收其中的毒素而免除痛苦，進了醫院就能有轉愈的希望，但是在前綫是無法取得冰凍手術的，於是發明一種似無綫電大小的電氣冰箱用救護車的馬達來轉動，用起來甚爲輕便。</p>
<p>今日所用的冰凍手術是被紐約醫科大學敎授愛倫（Dr．Frederick　M．Alleu）所發明，許多無希望的病症都被這種手術救活了。舉一個例子：一位八十三歲的病人的一只腿上生了壞疽病，這只腿送進了冰箱內一小時後不僅使他重獲生命並且絲毫無痛苦，作嘔，或虛脫的感覺。</p>
<p>愛倫敎授發明了冰凍手術後，倘遇到糖尿病或壞疽病能够减少死亡率百分七十五之多。</p>
<p>不久在治療學中冰凍手術的新器械就要產生，愛倫敎授又暗示或有某種新法來代替現在所用的方法。在潰爛部份施以冷酷的寒氣，那部份的細菌就會吸收並且縮至極小，然後漸漸平復。</p>
<p>冰凍對於皮膚的接合在醫學上也放一異彩，美國陸軍軍醫現在都採取這種方法：切一片病人的皮膚來補到爛的皮膚上去—這種手術在以前須要麻醉手術，結果舊的手術就能低劣的了。</p>
<p>雖然說醫學進入了冰凍時代這句話是太早了，但是却已透露了一綫曙光，鼓舞着這一角落的新發現。</p>
<h3>外滙提高後</h3>
<p>— 李觀</p>
<p>甲：外匯提高了，去多買些美國貨！</p>
<p>乙：什麼？外匯提高的目的，不是叫大家購買國貨嗎？</p>
<p>甲：因爲國貨都已漲價了，美國貨大部份還沒有大漲價，趁這時候多買一些。</p>
<p>乙：原來如此，無怪這幾天美國貨的生意更好了。</p>
<h3>青年樂園</h3>
<p>— 郁簡</p>
<p>昨日結業的廬山夏令營</p>
<p>中國青年廬山夏令營鏡頭</p>
<p>廬山的走　，固由於和平的商談，要人的來去。但形成了它特殊繁榮的，却是靑年團的夏令營，與江西省的暑期講習　。</p>
<p>暑期講習班是老大哥，夏令營是小老弟，這是雙方面都默契的。但老大哥對小老弟處處都是望塵莫及，不論在物質上；精神上，老大哥只有搖頭，自嘆勿如。夏令營都是年輕的小夥子，吃的是三葷二素一湯加饅頭，住的是六層樓的大厦，穿的是卡嘰布衣服。何况還有戲院式的講堂。宮殿似的圖書館，俱樂部般的中正室。加上每星期總有幾次電影·平劇·游藝會的演出，在將近三十位的男女體育敎官指導下，打球·游泳·機械操·隨心所欲。更値得驕傲的是：主席一星期總要蒞臨幾次，當講師的也起碼都是部院長。這使住在大林路小房子中，嚼着粗茶淡飯的暑期講習班的老大哥們怎麼會不嘆氣呢？</p>
<p>走到河東路的盡頭，就是夏令營的所在地。上午是鴉雀無聲，只有禮堂裏的擴音器，播出了講師們不同的音調。下午展開在運動塲上的是一幅健美圖，赤膊的男同學，裸臂女同學，沒有一個不是生龍活虎地活動着四肢。</p>
<p>傍晚，當流霞像濃脂抹紅了天邊的時候，你別單身地溜進那深林子，否則那相依相偎的對對情侶們，準曾刺痛了你的心。你不妨回過頭來，坐在小橋的石欄上，聽那遠處　來的陣陣歌聲，它倒反會給你感覺無限淸沁，而讓你合上眼睛，墮入了追憶的夢境中。</p>
<p>夏已去了，夏令營也結業了，但呆過夏令營的，沒有能忘懷這一段愉快的記憶！</p>
<h3>「美國月餅」</h3>

<p>或曰：「此不足爲奇，月亮旣然是美國的好，那末月餅當然亦是美國的好，所惜者不能將美國月亮搬到中國來，否則吃美國月餅，賞美國月亮，以成全　，豈不大佳？但廣東二字不知作何解，當存疑待考」。</p>

<h3>攝影機與杜魯門</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>名人趣事</p>
<p>美國杜魯門總統自從一九四四年四月十二日上任以來，每月大槪要拍照三百次，比歷史上任何人爲多。</p>
<p>故羅斯福總統非常瞭解照相的重要性。相片可以對億萬人顯示他的性格，可以增强或是减弱他在人民中的地位，也可以將他造成爲全國心目中的象徵。所以今日的杜魯門特別借重鏡頭。</p>
<p>於是，杜魯門總統，如同好萊塢明星一般，在照相機前總保持着最好的姿態。</p>
<p>八十年前，林肯總統坦白的說，競選照相帮助他走入了白宮，在現存的一百二十張林肯相片中，不過僅有三張能用作國家的肖像。</p>
<p>後來，攝影技術進步了，老羅斯福總統得益不少。但是，一九二〇年代還沒有新聞影片充份的流通各地表達眞正的總統的性格。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時代的威爾遜總統是美國總統在戲院致詞而　攝影的第一人。</p>
<p>故羅斯福總統的前任胡佛總統和再前任的柯立芝總統都不上鏡頭。他倆在照相機前都侷促不安，興奮，幾乎胆怯，所以不能利用這種機會，柯克芝在總統任內大概拍過二千一百次照，胡佛大槪一千五百次。</p>
<p>現在，杜魯門總統却懂得更多，「開麥拉記者」常逗留在白宮內。</p>
<h3>在牙醫師前　社會經驗</h3>
<p>— 芝薇</p>
<p>這是我從一位富於世故的朋友那裏聽來的：</p>
<p>假使你牙齒痛得連睡覺都成了問題，不得不去請敎牙醫師的時候，你應當先懂得你的救主是怎樣估價的。</p>
<p>當你去看牙醫師而吿訴他你要麻煩他時，你一定要熬住了昨夜躺在床上不能入睡而現出的痛苦，若無其事地對他說：</p>
<p>「醫生，請你看看，我這顆牙齒是否需要拔去；要是手續不便的話，我想隨它去也行！」</p>
<p>這樣，你在無形之中就省了不少鈔票；因爲牙醫師估價的尺度，是依你所感受的痛苦而定的；你表現的痛苦愈大時，也正是他敲你竹槓的一個好機會。</p>
<h3>有啥希奇？</h3>
<p>— 汜水</p>
<p>電車司機到站不停，有什麽希奇？他能開，能停；自然能不停。停和開的權利，在他的手上，爲甚麼他不能够隨自己的高興來運用？試問：在今天的中國裏，有幾個不是隨自己的高興來運用他的權利的？</p>
<p>電車賣票揩油，有什麽希奇？一個朋友說得好：「鋃錢過手，不揩油的是狗！」。和那些驚人的貪汚與不驚人的貪汚（其不驚人，因人不知也。）比起來，電車賣票的揩油，眞是微乎其微。而且根本與國庫無關，難道還不値得贊美？</p>
<p>乘客爭先恐後，不顧秩序，有什麽希奇？你自己軋不上，只好去埋怨上帝，爲甚麽把你生得這樣無能？駡別人不守秩序有什麼用？如果你實在軋不上，有不傳之秘一則可以敎給你，就是：去坐三輪車！如果你旣軋不上又坐不起三輪車，那麽，請你閉起眼睛仔細想一想：你還活在這世界上作甚麼？</p>
<p>沒有上車的乘客，頗講規則；一旦上車，態度全非，這又有什麼希奇？你還記得你那位老同學嗎？當初他改善社會風氣的論調該多動人？而當他榮任××長以後，你知道他那幾幢花園洋房是從那裏來的嗎？</p>
<p>電車公司爲了强硬之流，不得不减少車輛，這倒的確有點希奇。『你要坐，我徧不給你坐！』這樣看來，電車公司豈不也成了强硬之流！何况那些强硬之流並不因車輛减少而减少。除非一輛不開，他們總歸有車子坐；只不過可以分坐幾輛的，軋到了一輛上而己。而被軋出來的呢？自然是非强硬之流了！種豆得瓜，豈不希奇。</p>

<h3>Marshall's Fifth Trip to Lushan: Before Leaving Nanjing, He Met with Yu Dawei and Zhou Enlai Separately, Exploring New Avenues for Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall received Yu Dawei at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and then received Zhou Enlai at 11:00 AM. He left Nanjing for Lushan at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived at Lushan for the fifth time at 6:30 PM on the 23rd. Mrs. Marshall greeted him at Xiaotianchi. It is reported that Marshall is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart spent the 23rd with limited external contact. Shao Lizi visited him at 11:00 AM for about an hour, conveying the People's Political Council's stance on peace from the morning session. In the afternoon, besides meeting with Canadian Ambassador Odlum, Stuart also summoned his staff.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] US Embassy personnel informed reporters on the 23rd that Marshall and Stuart's mediation efforts are still focused on understanding the differences between the Communist and Nationalist sides. After repeated meetings, the positions of the two sides remain the same as before June 29th. Although both sides have expressed their willingness to resolve the issue politically, neither has made any new concessions. The Political Consultative Conference resolutions, military reorganization plan, and restoration of transportation are the main topics of discussion. The differences on transportation are relatively small, but the main sticking points between the Communists and Nationalists remain the location of Communist troops and local administrative power. The government believes that it has already made five points on the troop location issue and has no reason to concede further. The Communist Party continues to disagree. Therefore, Marshall and Stuart are seeking new avenues for mediation. They do not intend to propose any new plan until the crux of the problem is thoroughly understood. Marshall has flown to Guling to convey the Communist Party's views and seek Chairman Chiang's opinion. He is expected to return in the next few days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Before leaving Nanjing, Special Envoy Marshall held two important meetings. The first was with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei at 9:30 AM, which lasted until 10:30 AM, discussing the restoration of transportation according to the agreements signed by both the Nationalist and Communist sides. The second meeting was with Communist representative Zhou Enlai at 11:00 AM, which lasted until 12:30 PM. According to Communist sources, the discussion involved the "current situation." These sources said that this was Marshall's fifth trip to Guling, and it may be his last, but this does not mean that negotiations have broken down.</p>
<h3>Canadian Ambassador Odlum Speaks: The Visit to the Chairman Was Merely a Social Call, Denying Marshall's Request for Him to Participate in Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Canadian Ambassador to China, Major General Odlum, met with our reporter at the embassy on the 23rd, he firmly denied the foreign news agency report that Marshall had asked him to explain to Chairman Chiang in order to break the current stalemate in negotiations. In the straightforward manner of a military diplomat, he said: "I have visited Chairman Chiang several times in Guling, and I have also met with Marshall after returning to Nanjing. However, these were merely social calls, too ordinary to be considered significant, just like my current conversation with you (the reporter). It should not be inferred that I will participate in peace negotiations." His tone suggested dissatisfaction with the matter. When the reporter visited the US Embassy at 5:00 PM, Ambassador Odlum was seen arriving by car at 5:45 PM. When the reporter left at 6:30 PM, he had not yet departed, presumably still engaged in his "social" conversation with Ambassador Stuart.</p>
<h3>The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council Held a Discussion Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Declaration Calling for Peace Will Be Issued</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held an ad hoc meeting at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. Due to the lack of a quorum, it was changed to a discussion. The main topic was the proposal by seven councilors, including Fan Yuzui, Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaoxu, and Wu Chunwu, calling for peace and the resumption of negotiations to achieve peaceful unification. Wu Zhaoxu and others explained that they hoped military conflicts could cease immediately. Regarding military reorganization and unification, they hoped the Communist forces would comply with the military reorganization plan. Regarding the expansion of the government structure and convening of the National Assembly, they hoped the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference would be followed. If there were difficulties, they hoped the opinions of third parties such as Marshall and Stuart would be respected, and they proposed persuading Mao Zedong to stop mobilization. Because some councilors also wanted to speak, it was decided to hold another meeting in the afternoon of the 24th to draft a declaration, and to hold a meeting on the 30th to approve and publish it. The meeting also discussed the government's recent adjustment of exchange rates. The councilors hoped the government could find ways to prevent prices from rising in response to the exchange rate adjustment. The meeting lasted for two hours and forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi Agrees to the Early Convening of a Constitutional Draft Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When a reporter visited Minister Shao Lizi on the 23rd to inquire about the opinion of Mr. Zhang from Guling to convene a Constitutional Draft Review Committee, Shao said: "In my personal opinion, the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should also be convened as soon as possible." When the reporter asked whether the rumor that the People's Political Council would meet on Double Ten Day was true, Shao said: "Someone has made this suggestion, and it may be possible." Regarding the Lushan talks, Shao believed that if they did take place, they could not be called "talks" because they would have no formal structure and would not lead to any resolutions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Councilor Wu Chunwu told reporters that it was necessary for the People's Political Council to hold another meeting before the National Assembly was convened, but it was not yet decided whether it would be held on Double Ten Day.</p>
<p>Councilors in Shanghai Request a General Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Councilors in Shanghai, including Jiang Yong, Chu Fucheng, Zeng Qi, Huang Yanpei, Qian Yongming, Jiang Hengyuan, Zuo Shunsheng, Pan Yunru, Zhang Shizhao, Chang Naide, Pan Changyou, Luo Heng, Li Jianting, Hu Jianzhong, Zhou Chong, Tao Xuan, Chen Tingrui, Zhang Jishu, Jiang Ziping, Tao Baichuan, Chen Qitian, Duanmu Kai, Xi Lun, Wu Yun Chu, Deng Huamin, Zhang Qianhua, Wang Guanying, Tan Guang, Chen Mingde, Wang Dexing, Wang Weixin, Wu Wangji, Ye Suzhong, and Zhu Huiqing, noting that the National Government had ordered the term of the current People's Political Council to be extended to the end of October this year, held a meeting at the Shanghai Councilors' Association at 6:00 PM yesterday to review the current situation. They decided to jointly send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting the prompt convening of the Fourth Session of the Third National People's Political Council in order to hear reports on major policies and jointly seek solutions to save the situation.</p>
<h3>Kong Geng Issues a Statement Denying the Formation of a New Party</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 23rd] Councilor Kong Geng recently issued a solemn statement denying the formation of a new party. He stated that when the China Democratic Movement Association was being organized in Chongqing, he was listed as one of the initiators and participated in its sponsorship. However, he has not been involved in the association's activities since then. From this day forward, Kong Geng will not be responsible for any actions of the association. He hereby makes this solemn statement.</p>
<h3>Jiangxian Recovered, Quwo Relieved, Datong Still in Fierce Fighting, Communist Forces Greatly Increased in Hebei Province, War Breaks Out Again</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Military News: Situation in Shanxi: (1) Fierce fighting continues around Datong. On the night of the 19th, the northern train station was briefly captured by Communist forces but was repelled after fierce fighting. Communist forces captured a station and used four mountain guns to fiercely attack Dongxi Fengluo, northwest of Pingyao County.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Corrects Foreign Reporters' Records</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] A reporter recently visited Minister Peng Xuepei, who stated that the content of his conversation recorded by the United Press reporter at the foreign reporters' reception on the 21st did not fully match his original intention at the time. The following are the more important points that need to be corrected: The reporter asked, what is the significance of the Communist Party's mobilization order? I replied, there are not many regular troops in the Communist Party, but more so-called "local Communists." What is called mobilization is simply driving more farmers to join the local Communist forces. The foreign reporter asked, does the government attach importance to the Communist Party's mobilization order? I replied, it cannot be ignored either. Asked, is the mobilization order tantamount to a declaration of war? I replied that the term declaration of war is not applicable, and I meant that a party cannot declare war on the government. Asked, when will the government be reorganized to expand its base? I replied that the Executive Yuan already has non-Kuomintang members as Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Economy, and Transportation, and this expansion can continue at any time. Asked, is the government not reorganizing immediately because the conditions proposed by Chairman Chiang have not been accepted by the Communist Party? I replied that the so-called conditions are mostly the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference or the agreements signed by both parties, and only urge implementation. However, because the Communist Party has expanded its territory in the Northeast, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, the situation has changed, so the content of the conditions must also adapt to this situation. As for the main dispute, the United Press reporter's conjecture that the main conflict lies in whether northern Jiangsu counties should be governed by the Communist Party or the government is entirely their own. Asked, does the government support a referendum in northern Jiangsu under international supervision? I replied that I had not heard of such a peculiar suggestion, but there would be no freedom of voting under Communist rule. Asked, is the Political Consultative Conference dead? I replied that there is no question of life or death, and I meant that the terms of life and death are not very accurate. This issue is quite complex and cannot be summarized by the words life and death. In short, the Communist Party has recently put forward terms such as national mobilization and launching an offensive, loudly proclaiming that it is treating the government as an enemy, driving hundreds of thousands of illiterate people with no military training to blindly run onto the battlefield, and the object of its so-called offensive is the national army that has fought for eight years to defend the country and protect the people. How can we not feel pain and regret when we witness this scene? The government has a responsibility to defend the land and protect the people and cannot hand over the power of local and central governments to the Communist Party, which is a minority. This is definitely not the will of the Chinese people. I sincerely hope that the Communist Party will quickly follow Chairman Chiang's declaration on August 14, withdraw from areas that constitute a threat to peace and obstruct transportation, and withdraw its so-called mobilization offensive, so as to avoid涂炭 to the people. The government is like a parent to the people. Although it sometimes rebukes a few or snatches the knives and guns in their hands, the purpose is still to maintain the well-being of the whole family. Peaceful unification is always what the government desires.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Lushan Summer Camp: Chairman Chiang Delivers a Personal Address, Encouraging Students to Take on the Mission of Revolution and Become the Most Loyal Disciples of the Founding Father</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 23rd] The Lushan Summer Camp held its closing ceremony at the auditorium of the Chuanxi Study Hall at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as concurrent head of the团, personally presided over the ceremony. After leading the attendees in performing rituals, he delivered an impromptu address encouraging the students to focus on two things: practicing what they learn and studying academic methods. The address lasted for forty minutes. After the ceremony, he returned to the 行辕 to rest. At noon, he returned to the camp to have lunch with all the officials. When the chairman entered and exited the dining hall, cheers echoed throughout the valley. Dai Chuanxian, Zhou Zhongjun, He Haoruo, and Liu Keshu were invited to the camp as guests or lecturers to observe the ceremony on the 23rd. All the students in the camp who were not elected as delegates to the Second Plenary Session of the Youth League left Lushan on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang gave an address at the closing ceremony of the Lushan Summer Camp at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd. He first said that all the students in the summer camp should encourage each other to become the most loyal disciples of the Founding Father and take on the mission of completing the national revolution. Our revolutionary history is so long, and the Three Principles of the People are so great. Why is it that our principles have not yet been realized, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Founding Father's wishes to save and build the country have not yet been fulfilled? The only reason is that our successors cannot practice what they learn. Although the War of Resistance has now been won, the work of construction cannot yet be actively carried out. The country is in difficulty, society is in decline, and the suffering of our compatriots has not yet been alleviated. These are all our common shames, which we should deeply remember and take as our own responsibility. In the future, the success or failure of the revolution and nation-building will depend entirely on our spirit of practice. If everyone can recognize their responsibilities, be pragmatic in every task, and faithfully adhere to the oaths they have sworn and the principles they believe in, and can unswervingly practice and implement them, then the success of the revolution is without doubt. The Chairman then pointed out that in order to improve the efficiency of practice, everyone must cultivate a scientific spirit and learn the scientific order of doing things. The so-called scientific spirit is to be pragmatic and strive for excellence. The scientific order of doing things is to distinguish between importance and urgency, and to proceed from the fundamental to the superficial, and to adapt to the circumstances, grasp the key points, and make practical efforts. The basic work lies in careful analysis and research. If any problem can be thoroughly researched and discussed, then the essence of it can be discovered and a satisfactory solution can be obtained. Revolutionary party members must serve society and be loyal to the country, and they must use scientific principles to judge things and solve problems, so as to simplify complex matters and achieve twice the result with half the effort. The training given to you in the summer camp is not only to temper your body and mind and cultivate good living habits, but most importantly, to practice the principles, especially to have a practical understanding of work methods, and to unite to shoulder this sacred mission of saving and building the country. At 12:00, the chairman participated in the lunch with all the teachers and students and stood up to give an address amidst enthusiastic applause. He briefly said: "Revolutionary party members must have the compassion to care for all living things and serve the society and the people with the heart of one who is hungry and drowning. If there is one person in society who has no food to eat, no clothes to wear, or one person of any age or gender who is not in their proper place, then it is our revolutionary party's responsibility that has not been fulfilled and the efforts of the party members are not enough. They should be pointed out and criticized by others. Therefore, we revolutionary party members have no so-called rights, but only know that there are obligations, no so-called enjoyment, but only know that there is sacrifice. We must work hard and serve the people to relieve their suffering and improve their welfare, so that we will be worthy of being disciples of the Founding Father."</p>

<h3>Traitor Chu Minyi Executed by Firing Squad in Suzhou; In His Dying Words, He Hopes the Government Will Educate His Children; He Wishes His Body to Be Sent to Boji Hospital for Autopsy</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Foreign Minister of the puppet government, Ambassador to Japan, and Governor of Guangdong Province, traitor Chu Minyi, was executed by firing squad at the Shizikou No. 3 Prison in Suzhou on the morning of the 23rd. This generation of treacherous evildoer, although his family repeatedly requested a retrial, ultimately failed to escape death and was brought to justice under strict law. He was sixty-four years old. Our Suzhou-based reporter received advance notice and rushed to the execution ground at dawn to observe from a distance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Supervising Execution Officer Was Temporarily Reassigned</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM, more than thirty reporters from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi gathered at the No. 3 Prison. At 7:45 AM, the Suzhou High Procuratorate temporarily reassigned Prosecutor Liang Yiqing as the supervising execution officer, accompanied by Clerk Wang Xue____, leading six bailiffs, arrived by car, and were greeted by Warden Chen Songnian and led inside to rest briefly. At 8:00 AM, a temporary courtroom was set up in the prison's instruction hall. Prosecutor Liang, together with Warden Chen and Clerk Wang, took their seats and ordered the bailiffs to bring traitor Chu from Cell No. 2 in the Li-Zi ward. At that time, traitor Chu had just finished washing _____ and was sitting silently_____ on the bed. Seeing the situation, he knew that his final day had arrived and asked the bailiffs to go to the women's ward and inform traitor Chen _____ Jun. Traitor Chen turned pale upon hearing the news and hurriedly instructed the bailiffs to wait a moment. He then wrote a note to Prosecutor Liang, which read: "Yesterday I received the court's ruling rejecting the appeal, and this morning the appeal has been sent out." The intention was to stop the execution. Prosecutor Liang then contacted Chief Han by phone for instructions, and was instructed: "Do not stop the execution." He immediately ordered the prisoner to be brought back. Traitor Chu then knew that it was impossible to reverse the situation, so he changed into new clothes, including a dark gray woolen long gown, a white thin blue striped poplin short shirt and trousers, black silk socks, and black satin shoes. In his left hand he held a string of Buddhist beads. At the gate of the women's ward, he shook hands with Chen _____ Jun and said, "Goodbye." Traitor Chen covered her face with a handkerchief and sobbed without saying a word.</p>
<p>Forced a Smile While Posing for Photos Before the Execution</p>
<p>Traitor Chu was then escorted by the bailiffs to the temporary courtroom. As he passed through the side alley, photographers from various newspapers took pictures. Traitor Chu forced a smile, stood still, and said: "This is the last time, take good pictures." At 8:15 AM, traitor Chu stepped into the temporary courtroom. Although he tried to remain calm, his face was pale, accentuated by his bald head and long beard, making him look quite frightening. He did not salute the court, but stood proudly in front of the docket. It was evident that traitor Chu was filled with regret and hatred, which was endless. Prosecutor Liang first asked his age and origin. Traitor Chu answered loudly, _____ unusual, and the sound of his heart beating erratically could be clearly heard. When asked if he had a will, he initially replied, "No dying words," then continued.</p>
<p>Claimed to Be Ill and Volunteered for Dissection</p>
<p>"I am extremely calm about both life and death. I have nothing to be ashamed of in life, and death must have value. I hope my body can be sent to Boji Hospital in Tianci Village for dissection, because although I look very strong on the outside, I actually have internal illnesses. I am willing to provide it for medical researchers to study, so that they can make a specimen, as my contribution after death." He further said: "I studied at Boji Hospital for a year when I was seventeen, so I have a great connection, and they should accept my body without refusal." His words were quite incoherent. Prosecutor Liang continued to ask about the address of his family, and he replied: "Although someone should be coming to meet me, I don't know where they are currently living. I originally had a residence in Nanjing, but it has long since been moved." When asked again, "Do you have any dying words?" Traitor Chu pondered for a moment and then replied: "I have no will for my family, but I have one son-in-law, two daughters, and three sons. I hope the government can educate my children for me. As for the section on confiscating property, the fact is that my property is extremely pitiful. Since the government has regulations to provide living expenses for the families, I hope that it can be left a little more generously, so as to prevent my wife from having to work for food and clothing in her old age." Prosecutor Liang instructed, "The government will naturally be responsible for the education of your children. Do you have anything else to say?" Traitor Chu shook his head. Prosecutor Liang immediately ordered him to be removed from the courtroom and ordered the bailiffs to escort Traitor Chu to the execution ground. As he passed by the prison cells, the prisoners craned their necks to look out, and Traitor Chu frequently raised his hand and greeted them, saying, "I'm going first."</p>
<p>Killed Instantly with One Shot; Family Arrived Late</p>
<p>When _____ entered the execution ground, Traitor Chu had just walked to the left front side _____ next to the ground. Executioner Zhou Jiucheng took him by surprise and fired from behind, and one bullet hit the back of his head, exiting from the right side of his nose. Traitor Chu collapsed instantly, and before he hit the ground, he fell supine, head to the northeast, feet to the southwest, both hands clenched into fists and raised near his shoulders, eyes slightly open, blood flowing all over his face. Inspector Wang Chunrong, dispatched by the Suzhou District Procuratorate, arrived at the scene to inspect the body. Prosecutor Liang then returned to the court to report. It was also learned that Chu's wife, Chen Shunzhen, and her son, Chu Shuqi, had arrived in Suzhou from the capital by car on the evening of the 22nd and stayed at Room 208 of the China Hotel. On the morning of the 23rd, they heard the news in the newspaper. By the time her _____ son and daughter Mengyuan, as well as relative Jin Peiyuan, rushed to the No. 3 Prison, it was already 9:15 AM, and Traitor Chu had been executed for over an hour.

President Zhao Chen personally presided over the trial. Pu is seventy-one years old and suffers from chronic appendicitis. Sometimes his legs do not work properly, and he was carried to the court. Traitor Pu first confessed that during the Xinhai Revolution, he had proposed the abdication of the Emperor Xuantong and the establishment of the Republic of China in the Imperial Clan Council. Before the establishment of the Puppet Manchuria, after the July 7th Incident, he met with Pu Yi five times and advised him not to fall for the Japanese. In the 28th year, he came from Pingnan, and the following year he was deceived by traitor Chu Minyi and forced to participate in the Puppet Sixth National Congress. Later, he was appointed as a member of the Puppet National Government and Secretary-General of the Central Supervisory Committee, all of which were nominal positions. However, he was evasive about the matter of returning to Beiping and then coming to Nanjing to continue serving in the puppet regime. President Zhao then _____ asked why he did not cherish the glorious process of the first half of his life, but instead lost his integrity and collaborated with the enemy. The presiding judge declared that the trial would be postponed because the favorable evidence still needed to be investigated. The defense lawyer requested that the next court date be extended slightly so that he could go to Shanghai for medical treatment. The presiding judge agreed. The court adjourned at 12:01 PM, and Traitor Pu was released on bail and taken back.</p>

<h3>Minister Gu Inspects in Jinan and the Acting Chairman Conveys His Sympathy to the Refugees; Promises to Submit a Request to the Central Government to Allocate Relief Funds as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] Gu Zheng_____ on the 22nd, representing the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, conveyed his sympathy to the refugees in Shandong. Together with Yan Guofu, Liu Zhiping, Zhang Jingyu, and others, he personally inspected the various residences of the refugees. Most of the refugees in Jinan live in various county associations and the homes of relatives and friends, so refugees are everywhere in the streets and alleys, and every household is full. Eight or nine out of ten were fugitives from various counties who had been struggled against by the Communist army. The formerly wealthy families have all become starving paupers. Even those with a few acres of land have not been spared, and they have fled to Jinan with their families, enduring hardships. In a family, even if a few young adults work as laborers, it is difficult to maintain a family. Several families live together on broken mats in narrow alleys and cramped houses. In the cold of late autumn, there are entire families without a single quilt. The food is of poor quality, which is even more surprising. Even moldy, inferior millet cornbread that cattle and horses would not eat is still regarded as a treasure by the refugees, who soak it in water and swallow it. Mr. Gu couldn't stop the tears from flowing when he witnessed the situation. When Mr. Gu inquired about the situation of the refugees' families and the reasons for their flight, the refugees wept and said that most of them were law-abiding and well-behaved people who had enough food and clothing, but the Communist army confiscated their land and wanted to put them to death. Unable to bear the oppression, they fled to Jinan. Among them, Dong Zhongzhu, an elder from Feicheng Township, cried and described the tragic situation of his family of four generations fleeing to Jinan after their property was seized, which was even more moving______. The refugees are estimated to number no less than two or three hundred thousand. Their unanimous request is for the government to assist in restoring their homeland by force and to provide relief for their current livelihood. Mr. Gu delivered speeches everywhere, conveying the _____ concern of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang for the refugees, and reported that the government would definitely assist the refugees in returning to their homeland and do its best to allocate funds to maintain the lives of the refugees. He promised to convey the plight of the Shandong refugees to the Central Government and ask for as much relief funds as possible to meet the urgent needs. The refugee shelters run by the Shandong Post-War Relief Branch, which combine education and training, have achieved excellent results, and Mr. Gu expressed his deep appreciation. Furthermore, the _____ Orphanage has no funding and needs 30 million yuan per day. Mr. Gu promised that the Ministry of Social Affairs would take over the operation. Because the Executive Yuan allocated 1 billion yuan for urgent relief in northern Jiangsu, while only 300 million yuan was allocated to the entire Shandong Province, refugees from various counties in Shandong will jointly petition Mr. Gu within a few days, demanding equal treatment. In addition, refugees from more than ten counties in eastern Shandong have gathered in Qingdao, hoping that the government will have concrete relief measures. The _____ areas of Zichuan and Boshan are also crowded with refugees, and unemployed workers account for the majority. They are also waiting for Mr. Gu to inspect Zibo on the 23rd and petition him for relief.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The World Situation as Seen Through US-Yugoslav Relations</h3>
<p>After the issue of the Dardanelles Strait was raised by the Soviet Union, causing turmoil in the Eastern Mediterranean, and as the Paris Peace Conference entered its fourth week without reaching any agreement, the situation in Central Europe became tense due to the deterioration of relations between the United States and Yugoslavia. Most recently, the tense relationship between the US and Yugoslavia finally forced the United States to issue an ultimatum to Yugoslavia on the 22nd, demanding the release of the detained American pilots within 48 hours. The British government, while ostensibly staying out of the matter, in fact sympathized with the United States. If Yugoslav President Tito does not adopt a compromising attitude, Britain and the United States will act in unison. Some members of the US Congress have even advocated pressuring Tito to resign. Although Yugoslavia released the American airmen one hour before receiving the ultimatum, the mere presentation of this "note" has further destabilized the already turbulent European situation. Tinderboxes are everywhere; a slight misstep could ignite a conflagration. Indeed, in the year since the collapse of Nazi Germany, the crisis-ridden situation in Europe has never been more severe than it is today!</p>
<p>The direct cause of the deterioration of relations between the United States and Yugoslavia was the August 9th incident in which Yugoslav fighter planes attacked an American passenger plane forced to fly over Yugoslav airspace due to bad weather. The passengers and crew were detained by the Yugoslav authorities. The US Ambassador to Yugoslavia had previously been instructed by the State Department to send a note to the Yugoslav government. However, the Yugoslav government's reply, while seemingly mild on the surface, was in fact very strong, ignoring the US demands. This forced the US government to issue its ultimatum, demanding the immediate release of all detained personnel and their return to the border, or else the United States "will request the United Nations Security Council to convene immediately and take appropriate measures." American planes being attacked by Yugoslav planes and forced to land in Yugoslav territory has become increasingly common. According to news reports, this has happened three times in the past month. The repeated occurrence of these aircraft attacks without satisfactory resolution has naturally led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries. In addition to these aircraft attack incidents, US troops stationed in the port of Trieste have also been fired upon by Yugoslav troops. Therefore, the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia has been tense recently. The presentation of this "note" is in fact the result of the accumulation of deteriorating relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>According to news reports, the language of the ultimatum presented by the United States to Yugoslavia was unusually harsh, unseen since the Pearl Harbor incident, and full of indignation. A Yugoslav spokesman also stated that Marshal Tito might reject the demands in the American ultimatum. The wording of the reply was unknown at the time of writing. However, given Yugoslavia's release of the American personnel detained for many days, it seems that Yugoslavia's attitude has softened, and the overall situation may improve. If the impasse cannot be broken and the United States indeed requests the United Nations Security Council to convene immediately to take appropriate measures, then we must also consider whether the United Nations Security Council's convocation and the use of the veto power can provide an appropriate resolution to this incident. This will undoubtedly become the most significant test of whether the United Nations organization has power.</p>
<p>From the serious situation in US-Yugoslav relations, we should be able to glimpse the evolution of the world situation. Because for a economically backward country like Yugoslavia to repeatedly instigate events that provoke the United States, everyone knows that there is an international background to this. If there were not a stubborn force supporting her, Yugoslavia would never be so reckless. And everyone knows that the supporter of Yugoslavia is the currently dominant tense power, and it is definitely not entirely an event between the United States and Yugoslavia. To put it bluntly, it is a contest of power between the United States and the Soviet Union. If it were a purely Yugoslav affair, the United States would never resort to such harsh measures given its temperament. Yugoslavia was merely a tool after the war. Those who manipulate and use it are originally someone else. Looking deeper, the occurrence of this incident is closely related to the issue of the Dardanelles Strait, the Iranian issue, the disposal of Italy, and other events that appear everywhere. On the Soviet side, Yugoslavia's actions may be a test of the United States' reaction; and on the American side, after issuing the ultimatum, they also want to use Yugoslavia's response as a test of the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, how the Yugoslav incident is handled, how it evolves, and how it ends are deeply related to other issues. If this issue can be handled properly, other issues will naturally be easier to resolve. In other words, whether Yugoslavia's attitude turns to moderation and becomes less stubborn than before is related to the Soviet Union's attitude. How the international situation evolves thereafter depends not only on the development of US-Yugoslav relations, but also on whether the Soviet Union continues to act unilaterally on the international political stage, which is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>At this point, we cannot help but recall that the Allied authorities must bear considerable responsibility for the development of the situation in Yugoslavia to the present stage. Yugoslavia had heroic resistance to the invasion of the Axis forces and had a glorious page in the early days of the anti-Axis war. After the capital was occupied and the government went into exile, the Yugoslav people continued to struggle. The Tito regime, which was a minority in Yugoslavia, adopted the consistent communist approach of using a minority to oppress the majority, and also used its propaganda tactics to gain sympathy abroad. Today, Tito's rule in Yugoslavia is partly due to the lack of a firm and far-sighted policy towards Yugoslavia by the Allies in those years. It is a pity that American congressmen only today have expressed angry words that Tito must resign, but it is too late. Given the past lack of a firm policy towards Yugoslavia by the Allies, which has led to today's outcome, we wonder if the Allies will continue to use appeasement policies everywhere and plant the seeds of future destruction of peace? As we look at the world situation today, we believe that democracy and totalitarianism are irreconcilable forces. No matter how much democratic countries seek compromise with totalitarian countries, world peace is still unattainable. The maintenance of world peace cannot be achieved by appeasing violence!</p>

<h3>US Ultimatum Rejected by Yugoslavia; Tito Released US Personnel Beforehand</h3>
<p>(Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper) Regarding the incident of two US transport planes flying over the Yugoslav border due to navigational errors and being shot down by Yugoslav planes, attention has been focused on this issue since the US issued an unusually harsh ultimatum, requiring a response within 48 hours, as the deadline approaches. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) Belgrade on the 23rd, Marshal Tito has decided to reject the US ultimatum, but the Yugoslav Embassy in London stated that it was unaware of this matter.</p>
<p>Yugoslav President Tito</p>
<h3>Nine US Personnel Released, One US Plane Lost</h3>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade] Nine of the ten detained personnel were released on the 22nd, exactly one hour before US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson presented the ultimatum to Prime Minister Tito. The released nine personnel were accompanied by the US Consul General in Zagreb and left Glibuje, the place of detention, at around 1:00 PM on the 22nd. It is understood that there were two US planes shot down, which were protested in the US ultimatum. One plane was shot down on the 9th of this month, and its detained personnel have now been released. However, the whereabouts of the second plane, which was shot down by Yugoslav fighter planes on the 19th of this month, are still unclear. According to Radio Yugoslavia's broadcast on the 22nd, the personnel of the second plane that was shot down jumped from the air with parachutes and could not be found, and may have died on the ground, with no one surviving. In this case, the issue of the release of the personnel of the second plane remains unresolved. Prime Minister Tito's rejection of the US ultimatum may also indicate that Yugoslavia does not know the whereabouts of the second downed plane and cannot be held responsible. The United States is making very tense preparations for this matter, so that if Yugoslavia's official response to the ultimatum after the deadline is not satisfactory to the United States, appropriate measures will be taken.</p>
<p>Before this news was released, general indications on the 23rd seemed to hold promise of easing tensions. After the ultimatum was issued, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson flew by special plane to Prime Minister Tito's summer resort of Bled to personally negotiate with Tito. According to United Press International (UPI) Belgrade, Patterson told reporters on the 23rd, "The Yugoslav government has agreed to provide a fully satisfactory response," and that Tito had given assurances that such incidents would not happen again and that US representatives would receive all assistance and facilities to investigate the circumstances of the downed planes. According to United Press International (UPI) , Prime Minister Tito stated in a written response on the 22nd to inquiries from United Press International (UPI) and New York Times reporters, which were relayed by US Ambassador Patterson, that he had issued "strict orders" to the commander of the Yugoslav Fourth Army not to shoot down foreign "military or civilian" aircraft.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Delegates Focus on Yugoslav Incident; Molotov Meets with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister; Balkans May Again Become the Powder Keg of Europe</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper] Due to the dispute between Yugoslavia and the United States not being resolved before noon on the 23rd, the work of reviewing the draft Italian peace treaty is bound to be greatly hindered. The US delegation did not issue any comments on the ultimatum issue on the night of the 22nd. Only Connally and Byrnes, after their meeting, declared that Yugoslavia was our ally during the war, and we want to maintain the same relationship with them in peacetime. The shooting down of our airmen is disappointing and will only harm the international situation. According to United Press International (UPI), Molotov met with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj for forty minutes on the 22nd, and the discussion may have been about the US ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Molotov and Kardelj spoke in a room in front of the Luxembourg Palace, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky warned the delegates that "the Balkans may again become the powder keg of Europe." Manuilsky condemned the so-called greedy policies of the Balkan countries, saying that "this has a obviously negative influence on international relations."</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Returned to Rome Yesterday</h3>
<p>[AFP, Rome, 22nd] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi, who is in Paris, notified the Cabinet by long-distance telephone that a meeting would be held at 10:00 AM on the 24th of this month, and said that he would return to Rome tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Has Preconditions to Attending Japanese Reparations Conference</h3>
<p>[AFP, Washington, 23rd] The US government invited the countries concerned to participate in the Japanese reparations conference, requiring a response before the 15th of this month. All eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, except the Soviet Union, have responded, expressing their approval. The Soviet Union's attitude has not yet been clarified. According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has informally expressed its willingness to participate in the reparations conference, but has put forward some preconditions, which are being considered by other countries. The Japanese reparations conference is scheduled to be held in early September this year.</p>
<h3>I am Extremely Willing to Contribute to the Arduous Work of the Paris Peace Conference; Forming a Group with France, Australia, etc., to Strive for a Favorable Peace for Italy</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper] According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference issued a formal statement on the 22nd stating: Although the Paris Peace Conference is not directly related to China's national interests, the Chinese delegation attaches great importance to the work of the conference. The delegation will strive to contribute to the fair resolution of all major issues, because the negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference and its spirit will serve as a precedent for another conference in which Japan's fate will be determined. The date for the next plenary session of the conference will be determined by Secretary-General Dubois, but the Political and Territorial Committee for Italy is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM on the 23rd. All committees will not meet on the morning of the 23rd, presumably because the delegates of various countries have put forward many amendments to the draft treaty, and they must be translated into English, French, and Russian before they can be discussed, which is a cumbersome procedure. According to United Press International (UPI)</p>
<p>Our newspaper listens to Paris radio broadcasts: The Political and Territorial Committee for Italy met on the 23rd and passed the first section of the preamble to the treaty with Italy. All 21 member countries of the Peace Conference, except Norway, will sign the treaty with Italy. Yugoslavia originally proposed including Albania, but later withdrew the proposal, allowing the first section of the preamble to be passed. However, difficulties were encountered when discussing the wording of the second section. US Representative Connally attended the meeting for the first time on the 23rd. According to United Press International (UPI), China, France, Australia, and Canada have formed a group to strive for a more lenient peace for Italy. It is expected that the countries of this group will explain their new position at the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee for Italy on the 23rd, supporting the principle that the draft treaty with Italy should be lenient, because Italy assisted the United Nations in the war after overthrowing Mussolini.</p>
<p>According to United Press International (UPI), the Iranian delegation of three has left Tehran by plane for Paris on the 22nd to participate in the Peace Conference. The Soviet delegation denied external reports that Molotov had sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Lie requesting the postponement of the UN General Assembly. The UK and the US believe that there are many important items on the agenda of the UN General Assembly and it should not be postponed, but the work of the Paris Peace Conference should not be interrupted. Therefore, the number of delegates who agree to a partial recess of the Peace Conference is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Proposes Amendments to the Trieste Issue</h3>
<p>Our newspaper listens to Paris radio broadcasts: Yugoslavia's proposed amendments to the Trieste issue are roughly as follows: The task of the administrative body is to agree on the management rules of the port, prepare budgets, determine taxes, etc., and to appoint and remove the administrative director, deputy director, and port affairs officials of the special port. The administrative director is responsible for governing the special port, all levels of offices, and guiding its financial policy, and is granted full authority to handle everything by the aforementioned administrative body. The section on port management rules should be part of the treaty with Italy. Regarding the disposition of the Free Territory of Trieste, Yugoslavia considers it an agreement between the country and the Free City, and it cannot be modified without the consent of both parties. Yugoslavia's participation in the treaty with Italy is limited to the urban area of Trieste. The area is still under the governance of military authorities, and Yugoslavia proposes adopting a provisional government method, in which the military government should withdraw from the Free Territory one month after the treaty comes into effect. At this time, an international committee should be organized by the US, Soviet Union, UK, and France to exercise the relevant powers before the parliament is elected. The four countries should form four military regiments, each with 1,000 people, with each country sending one regiment to maintain security and order. These troops should be under unified command and withdraw one month after the parliament is elected. Administrative power belongs to the temporary government committee appointed by the international committee. The temporary government committee is composed of six members, four from the Italian side and two from the Yugoslav side. This temporary committee should form a temporary parliament with 60 members, including 40 from the Italian side and 20 from the Yugoslav side.</p>
<h3>Provisional Indian Government May Be Established Today; New Delhi is Under Strict Guard; Possibility of Renewed Conflict Between the Two Religions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Comprehensive News Service] Preparations for the provisional Indian government are largely complete. According to a London broadcast, it may be announced on the 24th. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) from New Delhi, Indian National Congress President Nehru and others met with Governor-General Wavell to conduct final discussions on the organization of the provisional government. The list of cabinet members for the provisional government was submitted by Nehru to the Governor-General on the morning of the 21st, but it is still subject to change and is not yet finalized. The cabinet will consist of fifteen members, with two seats reserved for the Muslim League, held vacant so that the Muslim League can join the provisional government at any time. Before assuming the position of Prime Minister of the cabinet, Nehru plans to resign from his position as Chairman of the National Congress Party. It is expected that the provisional government may be established in early September, and the Constituent Assembly is scheduled to open on September 15th. British Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck, who previously returned home to report on his duties and is currently in England, is planning to return to his post ahead of schedule due to the imminent establishment of the provisional government organized by Nehru. It is expected that he will arrive here within the month.</p>
<p>On the eve of the establishment of this provisional government, the conflict between Indian and Muslim ethnicities has not shown any signs of easing. The great riots in Calcutta, which lasted for four consecutive days, have just subsided, and New Delhi is now facing a crisis of bloodshed. People in New Delhi generally expect that conflicts may occur between Muslims and Hindus in the coming days because September is the Muslim month of "Ramadan," which traditionally involves fasting and prayer. This year, the religious ceremonies have been turned into political gatherings, and the situation has become tense, with fears that Muslims may instigate serious disturbances following the Calcutta incident. Muslim newspapers report that in the Calcutta incident, Muslims suffered four times the losses of Hindus. The majority of Muslim opinions believe that the disturbances caused by "Direct Action Day" were not only the first battle in the holy war to demand "Pakistan" (i.e., the partition of India and Pakistan) but also a humiliating defeat that requires immediate retaliation. Therefore, there is deep unrest in this ancient city. Police have been ordered to go out and take all necessary defensive measures to prevent incidents. On the evening of the 22nd, patrols were dispatched to key points in the city streets, and police officers were temporarily doubled. According to reliable sources, Muslims are not hiding their eagerness for revenge and their hope to cause trouble in the next day or two. Conversely, Hindus are more willing to avoid conflict but are determined to counterattack if attacked.</p>
<h3>Arab League To Attend London Conference With Conditions</h3>
<p>Demands Recognition of Hajj Amin al-Husseini as Representative of Muslims</p>
<p>[United Press, Alexandria, 22nd] The seven countries of the Arab League today submitted a note to the British government demanding recognition of Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, as one of the representatives of Palestinian Muslims. They stated that the Mufti is an indispensable figure in Palestine and that recognizing his leadership is extremely important. Meanwhile, some Arab leaders expect that the next meeting of the Arab League will nominate Hajj Amin al-Husseini as Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Executive Committee and will send representatives to discuss this matter with the British government. Other conditions include that since Jews have no right to discuss the Palestinian issue, Arabs do not want to attend the conference at the same time as Jews. In addition, the rights and interests of the Arabs should be the basis of these negotiations, and the issue of the Mandate or the Balfour Declaration (a declaration regarding the future of Jews in Palestine) should not be the basis for negotiations.</p>
<h3>Iran Denies Requesting U.S. Mediation in Anglo-Soviet Dispute; Minor Conflicts Occur in Anglo-Iranian Oil Region</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 22nd] Rumors that Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed-Maraghe'i requested the United States Ambassador to Tehran to mediate in the Anglo-Soviet dispute have been denied by the local radio station. It was stated that the policy adopted by the Iranian cabinet is based on the principle that foreign countries must not interfere in Iran's internal affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 22nd] Several minor conflicts occurred today in the Caspian Sea area north of Khuzestan, which is within the Anglo-Iranian oil field area. The central government has launched a campaign to collect "illegal arms" in northern Iran, and Prime Minister Sa'ed-Maraghe'i has extended the curfew by one hour "to prevent the incitement of trouble by rioters."</p>
<h3>Turkey Determined to Maintain Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty; Resolutely Rejects Unreasonable Soviet Demands; Britain Denies Deploying Troops on Iranian-Turkish Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Turkish radio station quoted the country's Ulus newspaper as saying: "We do not want war, but we are also determined to resolutely reject unreasonable demands. During the war, we contributed to the Allied countries, and after the war, we should also prevent threats to peace. We are willing to support the United Nations organization, but the prerequisite is to maintain the integrity of our territory."</p>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 22nd] Turkey today responded with an unhesitating "no" to the Soviet proposal for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait. The wording of the Turkish reply was quite diplomatic, but very firm, clearly stating to the Soviet Union that Turkey alone is capable of managing this important strait, and if any changes are desired, they must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Montreux Convention. According to a Turkish government spokesperson, American intervention has removed the Soviet threat to Turkey. "We blindly accept all of America's suggestions, and we fully trust America and its political views." The general impression is that the entire Straits issue has gradually relieved Turkey of its burden and has become an Anglo-American issue against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] A War Office spokesperson declared today: "The Moscow radio station's broadcast that British troops are moving towards the Turkish-Iraqi border is completely unfounded." The radio station quoted news from a Syrian newspaper that more British troops are expected to arrive in Iraq, with a portion concentrated on the Iraqi-Turkish border. According to a report from Iraq to a Beirut newspaper, more British Indian troops will continue to arrive in Basra, preparing to be transferred to the Iraqi-Turkish border. Furthermore, Syrians traveling from the Iraqi border to Beirut stated that British Indian troops are concentrating on the Iraqi-Turkish border.</p>
<h3>Sino-Greek Relations Deteriorating; Diplomatic Ties Hanging by a Thread</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] A "New York Times" correspondent reports that after the Greek government withdrew its ambassador to Yugoslavia, it is now considering recalling its ambassador to Yugoslavia as well. The general public is speculating that Yugoslavia's actions are about to sever diplomatic relations completely. According to most people's views, this move is part of a nerve war in the Balkans.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] The British Embassy in Greece announced tonight that the Yugoslav ship "Alexander I" was used for target practice and destroyed by British aircraft after it ran aground. Yugoslavia has protested to the Greek Foreign Ministry about this matter.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Manufacturing Weapons in Germany; Three Powers Demand Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency (CNA), Berlin, 22nd, United Press] Senior officials of the U.S. military government in Germany stated today that the U.S., Britain, and France may once again demand an investigation into the complete demilitarization of the four occupation zones. This is the result of Britain's formal accusation that the Soviet Union is continuing to manufacture weapons in its German occupation zone. Britain's accusation reminds people of rumors circulating among Germans that there are still munitions factories operating at high speed in the Soviet occupation zone (this rumor has long been dismissed as mere Japanese rumors and ignored). At the same time, there is news similar to the British reports, stating that the Soviet Union is manufacturing weapons in Germany, and this has been happening for quite some time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] A Foreign Office spokesperson said that after reports of the Soviet Union manufacturing arms in Germany have been repeatedly circulated, it is expected that some action will be taken, but the spokesperson declined to reveal the nature of the action.</p>
<h3>Military Staff Committee Drafting World Security Force Plan; Meetings Are Absolutely Secret and Content Cannot Be Fully Known</h3>
<p>[CNA Special Dispatch from New York, 23rd] The United Nations Military Staff Committee is continuing to hold secret meetings to draft a plan for a world security force, but there has been no news of its progress so far. This is because all representatives of the Military Staff Committee have agreed to maintain secrecy given the sensitivity of this work. Therefore, He Yingqin, the chief representative of our military delegation, also refused to discuss the work of the Military Staff Committee when interviewed by a CNA reporter. He Yingqin said, "This is our solemn oath. Any news related to the Military Staff Committee is best handled by the secretary of the committee." It is said that recently, one representative mentioned the progress of the Military Staff Committee's work in a broadcast. After another representative heard about it, he lodged a strong protest. Since then, every representative in the committee has kept their mouth shut.</p>
<h3>King of Siam Arrives in Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 23rd] The young King of Siam, accompanied by his mother and attendants, arrived at the airport here last night from Bangkok and immediately drove to a villa near Lausanne for rest.</p>
<h3>Impasse in Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations May Be Broken Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 22nd] After Egypt rejected Britain's latest proposal to revise the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, the British government's reply will be sent shortly. British Chief Delegate Stansgate spoke with the Egyptian Prime Minister for two hours yesterday and has submitted a report to London today. The crux of the negotiations is almost entirely on the issue of Middle East defense. Egyptian sources are confident that this hurdle can be overcome soon.</p>
<h3>Puyi Continues to Testify at the International Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>Surprisingly Says the Soviet Union Has No Ambitions in the Northeast</p>
<p>[CNA Special Dispatch from Tokyo, 23rd] Puyi testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East this morning, stating that the Soviet Union has no aggressive intentions in the Northeast. Puyi pointed out two incidents: "The Zhanggufeng Incident and the Lake Khasan Incident." Although the Soviet army won victories, they did not continue to advance, which is clear evidence of the Soviet Union's intentions in the Northeast. Puyi compared these two incidents with the various incidents involving Japan in China, believing that Japan's actions clearly indicated aggressive intentions towards China. Puyi's analogy aroused dissatisfaction from the defense attorneys. One defense attorney asked Puyi: "What benefit is there in presenting such examples in court?" Puyi then reiterated: "I have not received any promises. I am very willing to testify here, as this is my opportunity to expose Japan's oppression of China." A defense attorney then asked: "You have not been advised that if you refuse to give such testimony, what impact will it have on you?" Puyi burst out laughing and said: "This is ridiculous. I am of course here to testify of my own free will." Puyi went on to tell the court that after he went to the Soviet Union, he was questioned by the Soviets. He made statements to the Soviets, but the Soviets did not make any statements. Puyi testified for the fifth day today. Unlike yesterday's testimony, he has now regained the great trust of others.</p>
<h3>Australia Plans to Protest Japan's Whaling in the Southern Ocean</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 22nd] The Australian government hopes to obtain a Japanese whaling mother ship and eight whale catcher boats as part of reparations. The Australian government has a company with capital of three million pounds as its backing and plans to engage in whaling in the Southern Ocean. The Australian government also plans to strongly protest General MacArthur's permission for Japan to resume whaling in the Southern Ocean at the whaling conference to be held in Washington, D.C. in September.</p>
<h3>Korean Typhoon, Central Asia Earthquake</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The typhoon that struck Kyushu on the 19th has moved towards Korea. Seven people have died in the typhoon, and another person is seriously injured. Other losses include 75 houses destroyed, 112 houses and 45 buildings damaged, four bridges collapsed, railway tracks cut in seven places, 40 highways destroyed, and heavy crop losses.</p>

<h3>Greek Plebiscite to be Held on September 1st; Military to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] Greece is scheduled to hold a plebiscite on September 1st to decide whether King George should return to the country. From today onwards, all troops nationwide are not allowed to leave their barracks in order to be dispatched at any time to maintain order. Official Greek reports state that there has been very little activity by left-wing armed bandit groups in the past 48 hours, and the government has been able to fully control the situation in Central Macedonia. British experts, based on official British and Greek reports, stated that a total of 36 political murders occurred nationwide last week. At the same time, with the voting day approaching, both Republican and Royalist factions have intensified their activities, and Republicans have protested to the government about the restrictions on their actions.</p>
<h3>Amidst Tense International Situation, Rumors Spread of a Meeting Between the Big Three; However, Not Yet Officially Confirmed; Truman Arrives in Bermuda to a Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Regarding the rumors of a meeting between British Prime Minister Attlee, U.S. President Truman, and Soviet Marshal Stalin, the London Evening Standard quoted a New York report stating that President Truman welcomed the holding of a Big Three conference, believing that it would be the best way to quickly resolve the most important current international problems. If the international situation cannot be improved, the Big Three will meet somewhere in Europe before November. The United States wants to hold a Big Three conference before the congressional elections in November. The Democratic Party's power in the House of Representatives is waning. If the Big Three conference is held after the elections, President Truman will not be able to convince the other two leaders that he is speaking on behalf of the American people. According to well-informed sources here, it seems unlikely that a Big Three conference will take place. British officials also said that they have not heard of any Big Three meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the leaders of the British, American, and French governments will hold a meeting in the Atlantic Ocean. Cabinet Director Faure denied today that the French President had been invited to participate in the Atlantic meeting between British Prime Minister Attlee and U.S. President Truman, but said that it is possible that the British and American leaders may meet. The American side considers the rumor of a Big Three conference to be "ridiculous."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hamilton, Bermuda, 22nd] President Truman arrived here this afternoon aboard the yacht "Williamsburg." British officials and the public went to welcome him warmly and will hold a grand reception, but President Truman requested that there be no extravagance and that things be kept simple.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] As President Truman is currently cruising near Bermuda aboard a yacht, rumors are spreading that the President will meet with British Prime Minister Attlee at sea. When Ayers, an assistant at the State Department, was asked about this matter, he replied that he knew nothing about it.</p>

<h3>The Crux of the Three-Power Problem: Mutual Suspicion and Distrust</h3>
<p>— Written by European Affairs Authority, Shaw Desmond</p>
<p>Many Russians fear that the United States and Britain will dominate Eurasia to ensure their safety—because in that case, the security of the Soviet Union would be threatened. If war breaks out, the Soviet Union would be unable to resist the power of the United States and Britain. Similarly, many Americans and British fear that the Soviet Union will dominate Eurasia to ensure its safety—because in that case, the security of the United States and Britain would be threatened, and the United States and Britain would be unable to resist the power of the Soviet Union. The fear of both sides is unfounded, and even more, such psychology is a shortcut to death because another war will inevitably result in mutual destruction. Secretary of State Byrnes recently said, "The pursuit of security may not increase, or even decrease, the security of the world." He also said, "We are surrounded by taboos and distrust, which only increases taboos and distrust."</p>
<p>In this situation—where both sides firmly believe that the other wants to control the world—the two sides will never trust each other. From the American perspective, every move of Russia, such as seizing territory, controlling (?) communists in the United States and Britain, and striving to create pro-Russian groups in Eastern Europe and East Asia, can easily be seen as a conspiracy to destroy the democratic bloc and establish a Greater Soviet Union. Similarly, from the Russian perspective, America's Pan-American military cooperation policy, important bases, political loans, as well as the attempts of the Anglo-American bloc, and the emphasis on the propertied class in the Bahamas and China, all prove that the United States and Britain are adopting a plan to first encircle and then annihilate the Soviet Union, creating a connected "Greater Britain" and the "American Century." Both sides' suspicions have no basis whatsoever. However, both sides are busy devising means and strategies to protect themselves and deal with imagined crises. This fear has expanded to such an extent that the resolution of every international issue is based neither on the merits of the issue itself nor on the purpose of the United Nations to unite the world's nations. The most important thing in dealing with an issue is: how will this resolution affect the other side's (Britain and the United States or the Soviet Union) combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>However, Russia's fear is mostly formed by past experience. The United States and Britain cannot change the past, but if they can understand the impact of the past on today's Soviet Union, they can reduce insecurity and thus change the future.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Secures Its Own Safety By Any Means</p>
<p>In our generation, Russia has been invaded and destroyed three times, and all three invasions were stopped at the last moment. The tragic experiences of places like Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad are unforgettable for the Russian people. According to official Soviet estimates, from 1941 to 1945, the Soviet Union lost a total of 1,700 towns and cities, 70,000 villages, 84,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 31,000 factories, 13,000 bridges, 40,000 miles of railway, and 7 million people. The Soviet Union's losses in World War II were greater than those of all the Allied countries combined. Therefore, the Soviet people are determined to protect their own safety by any means, as long as it can provide them with security. This stubborn determination cannot be explained by ideological characteristics. However, if someone therefore concludes that today's Soviet Union is merely a re-enactment of the old Russian Empire or a red fascist tyranny, they would be ignoring human nature and the dynamics of Soviet society. Soviet socialism, whether good or bad, is definitely not fascism, nor is it an aggression that develops outward due to the inability to solve internal problems.</p>
<p>Gromyko, the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, said, "The Soviet Union will defend peace in the future, just as it has in the past. The Soviet people firmly believe that the peace policy adopted by the Soviet government is in line with the interests of peace-loving and war-hating people." However, if the means used do not reduce but increase the suspicion of foreign nations, the result will not be peace, but more risk of war. The Soviet Union is unable to seek security from "equilibrium" because the unity of the United States and Britain is too strong. Russia is also unable to seek security from "world revolution" because this will incite the resistance of all non-Soviet countries against Russia.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Builds Two Lines of Defense, Creating Spheres of Influence</p>
<p>What remains for the Soviet Union is only one path to take—that is, to promote three-power cooperation within the core of the United Nations; however, the opinions of the three powers diverge, and the United Nations is weak, so, as a last resort, Russia, like the United States and Britain, can only rely on its own industrial and military strength and relevant allies, buffer zones, and territories, but this approach hinders three-power cooperation. It is at this point that the Soviet Union feels the most contradiction. If Britain, France, the United States, and China all harbor fear and hatred towards Russia, then how can the United Nations Charter, the Soviet-British, Soviet-French, and Soviet-Chinese alliances and treaties of friendship serve as guarantees of security? As a result, the Soviet Union has no choice but to build a "second line of defense"—creating a vast sphere of influence, although this line of defense is no longer applicable in this age of rockets and atomic bombs. Unfortunately, this strategy has only thickened the attitude of foreign hostility and suspicion. All defensive plans have unfortunate consequences: the three powers clash, the United Nations organization weakens, countries feel insecure, and therefore strengthen defense work, resulting in more new troubles and new resentments.</p>
<p>Up to now, there has been no way to resolve this phenomenon of mutual causation. To resolve it, one must have a deep understanding of the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. This approach is actually quite simple. The Soviet government consistently interprets the Soviet security conditions as allied co-management of neighboring countries and the division of Eurasian border areas into Soviet and Anglo-American zones. This does not mean that the Soviet Union has territorial ambitions; it is really that the Soviet Union fears that other countries will use the surrounding areas to attack Russia. In the past, in 1904, 1918, 1937, 1938, and 1939, foreign forces came from the northeast; in 1915, from Turkey; in 1918, from Iran and Turkey; in 1915, 1918, 1920, and 1941, from Poland and the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet government insists on controlling all waterways and land routes that have been used to invade Russia. The movement of Slavic ethnic groups in Eastern Europe to seek unification under Soviet rule further strengthens the Soviet government's territorial demands. Unless there is overwhelming power, the Soviet government will not change the aforementioned security policy. At Yalta, Roosevelt, Churchill, and their advisors accepted some of the Soviet Union's proposals, but since last August, the Soviet Union has believed that Bevin and Byrnes intend to reduce or eliminate Soviet power in areas that already belong to the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<p>What threatens the Soviet Union the most is of course the atomic bomb. The Soviet government's response is: to sit tight on new territory; to question the British and American policies in Indonesia, the Near East, Greece, and Spain; to propose counter-conditions; and to prefer indefinitely delaying peace rather than accepting the British and American plan.</p>
<p>Establishing a World Government is the Only Way Out</p>
<p>The current struggle for hegemony can only have one of the following two results: (1) a major war, or a new reconciliation; (2) both sides mutually accept and respect each other's definition of security conditions. The first result is really the end of humanity. To restore the spirit of unity shown at the Yalta Conference, the governing authorities of the three countries must speak more frankly and fairly than they do now, with more honest aims and clearer definitions, and the relationship between the three powers must be more equal and reciprocal. Even to have this kind of unity bear fruit, far more conditions are needed than ordinary old-fashioned diplomacy can achieve.</p>
<p>This business of dividing up the world is really a necessary condition for survival. But it cannot save the world. To save the future, we must have a new concept of world order. In today's three-power situation, there is a lack of the boldness and creativity that this era needs. Similarly, such a spirit cannot be found in the current Versailles Treaty style. If the three powers adopt the methods of the post-World War I era, making treaties, establishing alliances, and creating a League of Nations, then the result will be that this world, which humanity could have had the power to turn into a paradise, will become a barren field full of scars.</p>
<p>What our new era urgently needs is to eliminate power politics and establish a government to govern all nations. To achieve this goal, the scope of the United Nations must be expanded and its responsibilities must be greatly increased. If the Soviet Union and Britain, one out of fear and the other out of doubt, are unwilling to come forward and initiate this, then the United States should use its power to lead the world towards this new goal.

<h3>Hardly Any Room for Spectators in the Gallery, Wen Lantao Still Not Brought to Court, More Than Ten Witnesses All Favorable to the Defendant, Wen Had Requested Bail and Was Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Wen Lantao treason case, which has been postponed again and again, was tried yesterday afternoon in the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court in Shanghai Prison. Spectators flocked to the scene, and there was hardly any room to stand in the courtroom.</p>
<p>At 3:10 PM, Judge Cao Jun ascended to the bench with the clerk and immediately informed Wen's defense lawyer that the defendant's health in prison had not been good recently, so the defendant would not be brought to court today, but only evidence would be investigated and witnesses questioned. Many of the spectators had come to see the "Old Wen" in person and to hear how he would defend himself. When they heard that the defendant himself would not appear in court, some of them left their seats.</p>
<p>Judge Cao then summoned the witnesses who had arrived in court one by one to provide favorable evidence for the defendant. (1) Wu Kunsheng, Manager of Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, stated: More than a dozen large yarn factories in Shanghai were managed by the enemy army after the Pacific War. At that time, the defendant was the chairman of the Yarn Factory Association and negotiated with the enemy to have them returned. (2) Yang Zhiyou, Manager of Minfeng Yarn Factory, stated: In addition to the yarn factories being returned through the defendant's negotiations, the yarn flower raw materials, machines, motors, etc. that were occupied by the enemy were also preserved thanks to the defendant's negotiations. (3) Lin Zengwang, Manager of Daxin Yarn Factory, stated: At that time, the enemy planned to destroy 33% of the total number of yarn spindles of all Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai for military use. When the large yarn factories heard the news, they successively sold off their yarn spindles. I obtained the defendant's hint and purchased 800 spindles from Yong'an Yarn Factory, and set up a small yarn factory in the suburbs, which was a method of breaking up the whole into parts. (4) Huang Hanzhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association, stated: The defendant has devoted himself to charity for decades, and there were many refugees and wounded soldiers rescued when the August 13th War broke out. (5) Zhu Xiechen, Standing Director of the Shanghai Renji Shantang, stated: The defendant has done his best to preside over relief efforts in various provinces over the years, and the number of refugees and wounded soldiers who have benefited is not small. (6) Chen Huimin, Female Lawyer, wife of former City Party Headquarters Chairman Du Ganglie, stated: When I was arrested in Shanghai on October 29th, 1941 for underground work, the defendant bailed me out at 12 o'clock that night. (7) Zhang Hongwei, Female Lawyer, stated: After I was arrested by the enemy in Shanghai in 1941 for working on the Women's Movement in the City Party Headquarters, the defendant entrusted someone to find a way to bail me out. (8) Qi Zaiyu, Major of the Military Intelligence Bureau, stated: I often reported to the Central Committee in Shanghai through the defendant, and I acted as an intermediary. I was arrested four times in Shanghai, and each time the defendant entrusted Li Guohua to negotiate with the enemy military police to rescue me. (9) Wu Shenyi, Currently Employed by the Military Intelligence Bureau, stated: The defendant had frequent contact with Li Mingyang, the former acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, regarding military intelligence. I was arrested in 1942 and rescued by the defendant. The radio station of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Shanghai Office was once attached to the defendant's home. (10) Hu Guoan, Representative of the Catholic Church, stated: After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the defendant and Father Rao and others contributed a lot of money and effort to the refugee area in Nanshi. The defendant also provided a lot of assistance to the expenses of the Tiren Hospital and other organizations. (11) Jiang Jun, Director of General Affairs of Guangci Hospital, stated: When the Shanghai War broke out, Guangci Hospital established the 24th Wounded Soldier Hospital, which was jointly organized by the defendant and Guangci Hospital. Over the years, the defendant has also made frequent donations of rice, grain, and money to Guangci Hospital.</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing, Xu Jiyun, and Others Present Four Written Documents</p>
<p>After the questioning of the witnesses came to an end, the defense lawyer presented four written documents, (1) a joint certificate for the defendant from Yan Huiqing, Xu Jiyun, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Zhixin, and others, (2) a statement that Xie Chengzhe, Administrative Commissioner and Security Commander of the Third District of Jiangsu, came to Shanghai in February 1945 to negotiate with Zhou Fohai, Ren Yuandao, and others to turn against the enemy, and the defendant also participated in the matter at that time, (3) a statement that Zhu Juntong, Director of the National Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, was arrested on February 9, 1941, and rescued by the defendant, (4) a statement that Zhang Xiaoxing, a comrade of the Sino-American Cooperation Institute's Shanghai Work Station, was arrested by the enemy and rescued by the defendant.</p>
<p>The defense lawyer then stated to the court that the defendant was suffering from illness in prison, which had been certified by a forensic doctor. Wen Chunnan, the defendant's son, had previously submitted a petition requesting that the defendant be released on bail, and he did not know what decision had been made. Judge Cao replied that the application had been rejected. The lawyer continued to say that the two defense lawyers were willing to apply on behalf of the defendant for bail and suspension of custody. The court immediately informed him that a written application must be submitted, and the decision would be made by the collegial panel of the court. The two lawyers still wanted to argue further, but Judge Cao informed them that the court had not granted him the power to make a decision in court, and that this matter must be applied for in writing and decided by the court after deliberation. After saying this, he announced the adjournment of the court, which was already 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sun Tianchang's Identity is Unclear, Zhang Binzhen's Case Awaits New Evidence Search, Investigation Team Releases Investigation Truth</h3>
<p>The Su-Zhe-Wan Area Enemy-Puppet Property Reception and Handling Work Investigation Team, stationed in Shanghai for nearly a month, the team leader Zhang Zhiben, the commissioners Cheng Zhongxing, Zhang Qingzhen, Wu Wangyi, Fan Zhengbo, and all the staff of the team, handled the investigation work with extreme seriousness, successively reviewed the reception work reports of various agencies, reaching more than 70 pieces, and there were a total of 200 conditions for the confidential cases being processed. In recent days, those who came to the team to submit confidential cases were still very enthusiastic. In addition to questioning the original defendant in detail based on the case, in order to obtain the truth of the case, the commissioners did not hesitate to overcome any difficulties and collected evidence in various ways. When necessary, the commissioners also went out to investigate privately, so that every case could be brought to light. The various shady phenomena in the early stage of reception that were exposed by the team were not few. Among the confidential cases that had been received, in addition to the Wang Zhuchen case that had been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal trial and came to an end, the important cases being processed included two cases of Sun Tianchang's secret sale of received materials. Yesterday, the reporter went to the team and asked Commissioner Zhang Qingzhen and Commissioner Wu Wangyi for details on the handling of the two cases, and they said as follows:</p>
<p>Twists and Turns in the Case</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Guanfang Sun Tianchangzhi, after receiving the confidential report, the team once summoned the defendant and searched for some evidence. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yu and other commissioners and Commissioner Fan went to Sun Tianchangzhi's factory on Pei'er Road, residence on Bei'dang Road, and warehouse on Xi'mo Road to inspect, spending several hours, but the location of the factory and warehouse could not be found. They only patrolled the residence once, which was purely a modern architectural warehouse, with a small amount of goods stored inside. At that time, because the defendant was out, no inquiries were made. On the 24th (today) morning, Yu and others will continue to go to the address to find and investigate. After the case occurred, the Sino-Korean Cultural Association sent a letter to the team, saying that it was also sending people to inspect, and requested that the association's right to speak be reserved. Therefore, the case is very tortuous. The first question seems to be to determine Sun Tianchangzhi's personal identity, whether she has any suspicion of colluding with the enemy, and then determine the handling method. The team is still searching for evidence as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Emphasize Two Points</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Binzhen, Director of the Shanghai Economic Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, who was accused of privately selling received materials, the content of the secret investigation focused on two points: (1) Whether more than 1,000 dairy cows had been received and secretly exchanged and sold, (2) Whether the farmland received had been divided and sold without authorization. The team notified the farm director to come to the team for inquiries yesterday. According to reports: The dairy cows on the farm were received from the Third Front Army, totaling more than 300 heads, and some of the sick cows and dead cows were sold and reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The calves born by the dairy cows were also reported in detail, with files available for review and accounts available for checking. As for the farmland received, there were original registers available for review. The part belonging to private property had been returned separately. Only more than 50 acres of the 1,000 acres of land on the Jiangwan Farm were reclaimed, and there was no unauthorized division and sale. He also submitted the original register at the time of receipt and relevant case files to the team for review. The case had previously been reported by the National Senate. The team believes that if no new evidence is presented in the case, the case is not very serious, or it is a misunderstanding. It is still collecting new evidence from the original informant in order to decide on a handling method. In addition, after the team randomly inspected the receiving warehouse, it was found that 60% to 70% of the internal materials had been unloaded, and there was no accumulation of mold and rot. As for theft and losses, the receiving agency claimed that it was inevitable, and random inspections would continue in the future. The team is still investigating the malpractices that have occurred in the allocation of houses.</p>
<p>Stopping the Receipt of Confidential Reports is Not True</p>
<p>In addition, according to the person in charge of the team: It is not true that the receipt of confidential reports will be stopped and the handling will be completed on the 24th of this month. The team had previously notified various agencies that had not submitted reception work reports to submit them on schedule before the 24th for review, which may have caused a misunderstanding. In fact, in addition to ordinary confidential cases, the team intends to leave people in Shanghai to continue receiving and handling important confidential cases when working in Hangzhou in the future.</p>
<h3>Municipal Fourth Hospital is Being Investigated After Being Reported</h3>
<p>According to reports from relevant sources to the reporter: After the Municipal Fourth Hospital was reported and accused of privately selling received materials, the team sent members to the hospital yesterday to investigate with Cao Jizheng and Peng Kezhang of the Health Bureau and others. Many important case evidences were found and are being actively handled.</p>
<h3>Zhao Xilin and Other Three Traitors Sentenced to Various Terms of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Liu Changxing and Others Adjourned for Sentencing</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The High Court announced yesterday the verdicts in two treason cases: (1) Zhao Xilin, the Inspector General of the Puppet Railway, was sentenced to five years in prison. (2) Zhang Yipu, an intelligence officer at the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters Nanjing Radio Station, was sentenced to three years in prison. (3) Cheng Zhiliang, Deputy Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Baojia Committee, was sentenced to two years and six months in prison. On the same day, the treason cases of Liu Changxing, Wang Yingliang, Wang Bingsheng, Hu Jia(?), Zhang Kexun, and Li Yongkang were concluded and will be sentenced on the morning of the 30th of this month. Also heard: (1) Tao Zhongli, the boss of the former Shanghai Oriental Shenqu Theater and a secret agent of the enemy military police, (2) Zhang Guangdou, the chief of the preparatory office of the Puppet Changsha Xinghua Bank, (3) Zhao Riliang, a staff member of the Special Higher Section of the Puppet Weihaiwei Police Bureau, (4) Yang Qing, a police officer of the Puppet Shanghai Huxi District Police Station, (5) Liu Kezhang, the head of the 12th Bao of the first Fang in the Puppet Shanghai Huxi District, and Liu Guangda, the head of the 8th Bao of the Puppet Caojiadu District.

<h3>No New Developments in the Forging of Fake US Dollars, Main Culprit Swiss National Weidrele Has Actual Evidence of Collusion with the Enemy, Investigation Reveals He Once Forced the Enemy Army to Purchase Copper</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Swiss national Weidrele, a war criminal who colluded with the enemy, has been under interrogation since being arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that the copper he sold to the Japanese side was originally purchased by our Central Mint from the American firm Mufeng Yangxing before the war. When the batch of copper arrived, the War of Resistance had already broken out, so it was temporarily stored in the firm's food warehouse. In October 1941, Weidrele, relying on the power of the Japanese side, forced Mufeng Yangxing to sell it to the Japanese army in the position of an intermediary. At that time, the market price was about 10 million yuan, but the Japanese side only paid 1 million yuan. Weidrele made huge profits from this, and his residence on You'nigan Road was one of the gains. Currently, the Garrison Headquarters is still searching for detailed evidence and will consult the Swiss Consulate on the reasons for expelling the criminal from Swiss nationality and ask Mufeng Yangxing to reply in writing about the situation of being forced to sell copper at that time. As for the manufacturing of fake US dollars, there have been no important new findings to date. It is heard that the criminal will be sent to court in a week.</p>

<h3>Premier Song Flew to Shanghai Yesterday and Met with Minister Xu and Mayor Wu</h3>

<h3>Leather Industry Appeals for Loans, Unable to Compete with Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Leather Industry Association hosted a press conference yesterday to report on the industry's plight and appeal to the government for active lending. According to the person in charge, the current influx of foreign goods into China, due to large-scale manufacturing, has lower costs than domestic goods, making it difficult to compete. Although the situation is expected to improve after the recent relaxation of foreign exchange controls, the biggest difficulty for the leather industry is the turnover of funds. The interest rate on the market is at least two cents per month, which is unbearable. The government's loan regulations for industry and commerce require a considerable scale and more than fifty workers. However, most leather manufacturing is small-scale manual labor. Therefore, they hope that the government will consider the actual difficulties and provide flexible loans.</p>
<h3>Press Circles Prepare to Celebrate September 1st Journalists' Day and Commemorate Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The "September 1st" Journalists' Day is fast approaching. Although this year's Journalists' Day is the second after the victory, the city had not yet been recovered and the press was just beginning to be re-established during last year's festival, so no celebration was held. In view of this, the Shanghai Journalists Association, upon the approval of the Standing Council, will hold a grand celebration on Journalists' Day this year. In addition to a memorial meeting on the morning of the 1st, a garden party and dinner will be held on the same evening. At the same time, in order to commemorate the colleagues in the press who fought bravely against the enemy and puppets in Shanghai during the War of Resistance and were tragically sacrificed, a "Shanghai Press Circle Commemoration Meeting for Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves During the War of Resistance" will be held on the afternoon of the 2nd to express condolences.

In addition, the Journalists Association will present commemorative certificates to the press colleagues who suffered during the War of Resistance. These will be awarded at the Journalists' Day memorial meeting.

<h3>Rong Yongming's Crime is Minor; Released on Bail Pending Trial According to Law; Likely to be Sentenced to a Fine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Rong Yongming, manager of Wuchang Rice Store, has been released on bail by order of the Garrison Headquarters. However, according to a person in charge of the Military Law Office, Rong Yongming's release does not mean that he is innocent. Because Mr. Rong has been detained in prison for a long time, the evidence is insufficient after review. A letter has been sent to the municipal government to provide more convincing evidence, but there has been no response so far. Since the case should not be suspended for long, it has been submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for review based on the results of the investigation. According to the law, those whose crimes are minor can be released on bail pending trial, so he has been temporarily released. It is understood that Rong Yongming's case may end with a fine.</p>
<h3>A 200-Year-Old Giant Eagle with a Wingspan of Over Ten Feet; Open to Public Viewing for Ten Days Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At the end of last year, a villager in Luoxi Village, Tiantai Mountain, was washing a cow's stomach by the stream when he suddenly felt like his shoulders were being grabbed tightly, and he couldn't move. Looking back, he saw a huge and ferocious giant eagle. (See picture)</p>
<p>The villager fought with the eagle. The eagle pecked at him, tearing his clothes and flesh. When he tried to escape, the eagle grabbed him and tried to fly away. After struggling for about an hour, he was covered in injuries and had to scream for help. Fortunately, Mr. Xu Ziqiang of the Chinese Ornithology Research Society and his friends were passing by on a hunting trip and rushed to rescue him, but they couldn't get close to the eagle! Finally, he fired a shot and hit the eagle's left wing, and only then was he able to catch it.</p>
<p>According to scholars, this eagle is called the "Lammergeier." It usually lives in high mountains and deep valleys, specializing in catching snakes, rabbits, and sheep. Its feathers are all black, its ears are like those of an ape, its top is covered with animal fur, its neck is like a python, its beak is like an owl, its shoulders are like a jackal, its eyes are like a jackal, its back is like a bear, its belly is like a cow, its wings are like sickles, and its claws are like iron! Its cry is terrifying, and it is even more mournful at midnight, sending shivers down the spines of those who hear it. It stands over four feet tall, has a wingspan of over ten feet, and weighs over forty-two and a half pounds!</p>
<p>It is said that this kind of eagle usually grows in the high plateau and desert areas of the Himalayas. This time, it came to the coast, following Allied aircraft and finally fell due to exhaustion. Now Mr. Xu Ziqiang has escorted this amazing bird to Shanghai. After more than eight months of breeding, it has become much more docile than before.</p>
<p>This lammergeier is said to be between 150 and 200 years old. It is scheduled to be exhibited at the Ningbo Fellow Association for ten days starting on the 24th. Shanghai people who love novelty can once again feast their eyes.</p>

The authorities have been sending special commissioner Huang Jiaju to various districts to investigate in recent days. Yesterday, seven rice stores, including Dexing, Dasen, Wanfeng, Houfeng, Yixingqia, Hengda, and Gongzhong, were found on North Sichuan Road near Diswei Road to be secretly raising rice prices. The persons in charge of each store were taken to the Bureau of Social Affairs for questioning.</p>
<h3>Committee for the Restoration of Factories in the Rear Area Sends Representatives to Guling to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Committee for the Restoration of Factories in the Rear Area of the China Production Promotion Association, in order to request relief for factories relocating from the rear area and to suggest the organization of joint factories to seek rapid restoration, sent representatives to Nanjing at the beginning of last month to petition. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu not only expressed his sympathy, but also submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval on his behalf, giving a 30% discount when selling enemy-puppet factories. However, the suggestion of joint factories was not agreed to. Now, the factories in the rear area feel that the estimated prices of the enemy-occupied factories sold by the Enemy-Occupied Property Administration are too high (the price of one factory ranges from hundreds of millions of yuan to tens of billions of yuan), and the factories still feel unable to bear the burden. Therefore, there were very few bidders for the seventh phase of the enemy-occupied factory sales, which ended on the day before yesterday. It is said that there were only a few. The committee decided today to send representative Xie Tiansha to Guling to visit the Chairman and present everything in person.</p>

The settlement method will be based on the contract between UNRRA and the buyer. If the contract does not specify, it will be based on legal provisions. If the payment method does not comply with these principles, the person in charge will be responsible for the assets.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over the "Double Bao" Case Between Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Stores</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qiu Tianbao Deji Jewelry Store at 383 Nanjing Road in this city was originally located in Xiaodongmen, Nanshi before the war. On the 14th of last month, it saw a newspaper advertisement stating that Chongqing Qiu Tianbao Fuji Jewelry Store was moving to Shanghai and opening for business at 39 Baoshan Road. Deji believed that it had applied to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for registration and establishment as early as 1933, and had obtained a business license from the Ministry of Industry, and had legally obtained the exclusive right to the name, and others should not re-use it for establishment. The two sides then posted large advertisements in the newspapers, attacking each other, and finally took the matter to court. The case was heard in the Civil Court of the local court yesterday. Yao Lianfang, the legal representative of the plaintiff Deji Qiu Tianbao, was represented by lawyers Jiang Pingfan. Qiu Jiahe and Zhang Liantang, the legal representatives of the defendant Fuji Qiu Tianbao, were represented by lawyer Chen Zhen. They argued that the defendant's name already had the words "Chongqing," and had the distinction of "Fuji," and further stated that it was moving to Shanghai from Chongqing, and had published the Chongqing Bureau of Social Affairs' approval to move to Shanghai for business. It cannot be considered that it would affect confusion, and the court is requested to reject the plaintiff's claim. The court ordered the case to be heard again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Witness in the Murder of Hong Kong-American Pilots; Isogai Questioned Yesterday; Applicability of Japanese Regulations on the Treatment of Pilots from Enemy Countries Becomes Focus of Debate Between the Two Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Lieutenant General Isogai Rensuke, former Governor of Hong Kong, who was escorted to Shanghai from Tokyo a month ago and detained in the Tilanqiao Prison by our military court, appeared in the US military court yesterday as a witness to testify in the murder case of Major Hook. Because during the trial in the past two days, the defendant claimed that the death sentence for Hook was based on the emergency regulations on the treatment of pilots from enemy countries promulgated by the Japanese government at that time, Isogai was called to testify yesterday morning. After the trial began, prosecutor Dewey first questioned the defendant Yamaguchi Kyoichi, who was acting as a witness. Dewey pointed out that Yamaguchi's testimony was very different from the interrogation he received in Hong Kong in December last year, and criticized the Japanese military court for being extremely negligent in collecting evidence, and even failing to investigate what goods were carried on the sunken fishing boat. Dewey then instructed Yamaguchi to say which article of the regulations on the treatment of pilots from enemy countries was used to sentence Hook to death. Yamaguchi replied that it was Article 3, "crime of attacking merchant ships." Dewey immediately produced the sentencing document at the time, which clearly stated that it was based on Article 2, "destroying non-military property." At this time, Yamaguchi was extremely embarrassed and claimed that it was a memory error. The court immediately ordered Isogai to take the witness stand. Although Isogai was old and haggard, with a very ferocious face, after reading the regulations that Yamaguchi had written down based on memory, he declared that he did indeed promulgate them in Hong Kong in 1942, but he could not remember whether the details were consistent. The prosecutor immediately pointed out that he did not believe that this regulation existed. Even if it existed, it was not applicable to this case. The defendant's lawyer requested that the court either accept Isogai's testimony or put the case on hold so that Tokyo could send a copy of the regulation before re-opening the trial. The court adjourned to discuss this for more than two hours, and there was still no result when the reporter left the court. It is understood that the case may end in a day or two. In addition, two Japanese soldiers who abused American prisoners of war at the American prisoner of war camp in Shenyang will be tried by the American military court recently. The two are Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima.</p>
<h3>Several Money Exchanges and Jewelry Stores in Taiwan Accused in Stolen Gold Case</h3>
<p>[United Press Shanghai Report] Regarding the case of the theft of a large number of gold bars in Taiwan, the Taiwan authorities filed lawsuits against more than six jewelry stores and money exchanges in the local court yesterday. When recovering all the stolen goods, it was discovered that a former US Army lieutenant colonel who had been discharged and returned to the country had stolen Taiwan gold bars worth US$150,000. At the same time, it is said that the total value of the stolen goods received by the jewelry stores and money exchanges is about US$1 million. It is understood that the American officer arrived in Taiwan first at the end of the war and received 3,992 ounces of gold bars from the Japanese army and transferred them to the Chinese authorities. However, the officer transferred only half of them to the Chinese government and swallowed the rest himself. When he returned to Shanghai last year, he sold 1,996 taels of gold privately through another American officer. The Chinese authorities only cracked the case after interrogating a Japanese officer in Taiwan. According to official news from Washington received by the Taiwan authorities, the law-breaking officer has already been discharged and will not be tried by a military court. If it is not intended to open a trial in the American court, the Chinese authorities can request that the criminal be extradited to the Chinese court for trial.</p>
<h3>Wei Jimin Talks About Slight Changes in Personnel of Eight Warships</h3>
<p>Wei Jimin, Chief of Staff of the Naval Fleet Command, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Nanjing with the Tai Kang and other eight warships donated by the United States. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited him to inquire about the situation of the new fleet. According to Wei, after the new fleet sailed back to China from the United States, it was appropriately adjusted to suit the organization of our navy. Former commander Lin Zun is currently in Nanjing handling transfer procedures. Once the transfer is completed, he will go to the United States to return to his post. Therefore, the position of commander is held concurrently by him. All kinds of rumors from outside are not true. He also said that he did not know the basis for Xu Heng's detention. The fact that Xu Heng has been ordered to serve in the Navy Headquarters has already been proven, so there is no need to elaborate. The warship is currently staying in Nanjing to strengthen training, and will sail to other places to serve after a considerable period of time. As for the changes in personnel of the new fleet, Liang Xuzhao, captain of the Tai Kang, was replaced by Gao Ju. Cao Zhongzhou, captain of the Taiping, was replaced by Mai Shiyao. Xu Heng, captain of the Yongning, was replaced by Wang Enhua. There were no other major changes in personnel.</p>

<h3>All Criminals in the Case of the Robbery and Murder of a Pedicab Driver Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the night of July 19, several bandits robbed Zhang Zilong of a pedicab at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road in Hongkou, and strangled him to death with a rope. Accomplices Zou Chunmao, Zhou Yongtai, Zhu A'gen, and others were arrested by the police one after another. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the main culprit in the case, Zhang Changgen, also known as Cai [Blank], was secretly reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, and Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, along with police officers Zhang Decai, Chen Junfeng, Cong Wendou, and Tang Lunmei, went to the Wuzhou Road market on the 10th of this month and arrested Zhang from among the sleeping crowds. After being brought to the station for interrogation, he confessed to stealing more than ten tricycles, bicycles, and rickshaws in Nonglin Department and other places on Shigaota Road. All the stolen vehicles were then recovered and handed over to the owners for collection. However, he denied participating in the murder of pedicab driver Zhang Zilong at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road. Later, the branch station interrogated the three accomplices Zou Chunmao, Zhou Yongtai, and Zhu A'gen from the Garrison Headquarters separately, and they confessed the truth. They confessed that on the evening of July 19, Zhang Changgen, Zou Chunmao, and Zhou Yongtai went to the Hongguang Theater on North Sichuan Road to watch a play, and discussed ways to rob a military vehicle. Later, Zhang Changgen ordered Zhou Yongtai to ambush at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road. When Zhang and Zou left the theater after the play, they chose a brand-new pedicab, the vehicle of the victim Zhang Zilong, and hired it to the above-mentioned location for a price of 1,500 yuan. After arriving at the destination, Zhang Changgen pretended to pay the fare and took the opportunity to put the pre-hidden rope around Zhang's neck. Then, Zou Chunmao and others tied Zhang's hands, feet, mouth, and nose with a towel and threw him to the ground. After a while, Zhang Zilong died. At that time, Zou Chunmao drove the pedicab away. After his accomplices were questioned one by one, Zhang was speechless and directly admitted the above facts without denying them. The case has been investigated and is planned to be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation and handling in accordance with the law.</p>

Each census taker must knock on the door outside the household being surveyed (regardless of whether the door is open or closed), and after someone inside answers, explain the purpose of the visit before entering for investigation, limited to the reception room or hall. Unauthorized entry into inner rooms, such as attics, kitchen sheds, lofts, drying platforms, or rooms where meals and lodging are all in one place, is prohibited. Those who are inconvenient to enter should be recorded on the door. 3. When questioning the person being surveyed, the attitude should be humble, the words concise, and no irrelevant conversations beyond the prescribed items should be made. 4. If a household with a wedding, funeral, celebration, or special event is encountered, which is inconvenient to inquire about immediately, the survey should be postponed and only the address recorded for a later follow-up. 5. If the residents of the household being surveyed are out early and return late due to occupational reasons, or have gone elsewhere for some reason and there is no one at home, inquiries can be made indirectly from their co-residents or neighbors. If the inquiries are not detailed, inquire about their return time, record the address, and conduct a follow-up survey separately. 6. To avoid misunderstandings among citizens and to prevent petty thieves from impersonating census takers, the census takers should be neatly dressed and accompanied by Baojia personnel. In short, this occupational census takes comprehensive consideration for the convenience of residents. However, the start date has not yet been determined, and it is said that preparations are currently being intensified.</p>

<h3>Measures for Recalling Students Studying in Japan, Ministry of Education is Formulating Them Carefully</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing] During the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese students who went to study in Japan had their qualifications not carefully examined due to the different circumstances at that time. After the victory, the funding for these students has become a problem due to the fluctuations in prices. The Japanese side has requested the Chinese authorities to recall these students. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has contacted the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education has decided to recall the Chinese students studying in Japan. However, there are currently four problems: (1) Transportation for returning students, how to transport them due to the large number? (2) Students from schools in the puppet organizations during the war have undergone screening and testing to determine their grades, but the qualifications of students studying in Japan during the war are extremely chaotic, and there are even those who went to study without graduating from middle school. How should the qualifications of these students be determined and recognized after they are recalled? (3) The employment problem after recall. How to plan? (4) Many students studying in Japan have dependents. Who should return with their families and who should not? Their qualifications must be studied and appropriate measures discussed. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is currently carefully formulating these measures and will formally announce them in the coming days.</p>

<p>Problem Research</p>
<h3>How to Promote Art Education?</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>What exactly is the significance of art education? We can understand this by looking at the curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education regarding the goals of art courses in primary and secondary schools. Roughly speaking, "love of beauty" and "creative beauty" are innate human instincts. How can we satisfy and develop these instincts? That is the mission of art education.</p>
<p>Although art education has its value and the Ministry of Education has set standards, it is generally not given attention, and schools do not implement it earnestly. This was true during the War of Resistance, and even before that, in Shanghai's secondary schools, more than 60% did not have art departments. Now that we have won, we should catch up with scientific education, such as "atomic energy," but art, which can develop human love, kindness, and virtue, can also be developed in parallel with scientific education under the goal of "education first." Perhaps there will be a day when all of humanity is immersed in the atmosphere of art, moving from beauty to goodness, from goodness to truth, so that the prosperity of science does not become a weapon of murder but a tool for benefiting people, achieving a world of common good, peace, prosperity, and strength.</p>
<p>Promoting art education requires the supervision and guidance of educational authorities and the earnest implementation by schools. From a proactive perspective, there are two main issues: equipment and teachers. Equipment requires funding. If there is sufficient funding, then ideally, art education should have special classrooms, such as drawing classrooms, crafts classrooms, music classrooms, etc. Various tools, as well as lighting arrangements, must be perfect and reasonable. Crafts – such as metalwork, woodwork, clay work, and rattan work – require many tools. Drawing – such as plaster models, sketching easels, and work samples. Music – such as organs, pianos, and violins. Regardless of whether schools are public or private, they should allocate a portion of their purchasing budget to equipment for art departments.</p>
<p>As for the issue of teachers, it has become the most serious problem at present. Xie Haiyan, the former dean of academic affairs at the National Art Academy, wrote from Chongqing with a concrete estimate of the need for art teachers: currently, there are a total of 3,455 secondary schools nationwide, including middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, with 24,664 classes and 1,111,000 students. At least 7,500 art teachers are needed (including crafts, music, and art), but there are only 4,500 art teachers in secondary schools, leaving a shortage of more than 3,000. Therefore, many schools cannot find art teachers at all. The Minister of Education reported to the Political Council that, in order to adapt to post-war reconstruction, the number of secondary schools will be expanded by two to three times the current number. In this case, there will be a shortage of 25,000 art teachers in secondary schools. This is the situation nationwide. Even in Shanghai alone, there are currently 240 public and private secondary schools, most of which do not have art departments. Once all schools implement art education in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry, the panic over the shortage of art teachers will be difficult to resolve for a while.</p>
<p>The target audience of art education is not limited to schools. It can be spread anytime, anywhere in the general public. However, art educators and art teachers are a long-standing problem that requires active training. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, recognizing this, has begun to prepare for the establishment of an art normal school, which will be established and enroll students this semester. In the future, the problem of art teachers can be gradually resolved. In general, art facilities, given the current financial difficulties of the municipality, should be combined with existing social organizations to carry out art-related work, launching various art movements, music concerts, art exhibitions, and gallery lectures, so that the public can receive the cultivation of art education anytime, anywhere, which is extremely necessary.</p>

<h3>China Textile Corporation Holds Board Meeting Today; All Parties Concerned About Distribution Issues; Actual Sales Remain Stagnant; Black Market Driven by Speculation</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company will hold a board meeting today (24th). Cotton spinning and replication industries using yarn and cloth as raw materials, such as dyeing and weaving, knitting, towel and blanket, handkerchief, and underwear industries, have been closely watching the policy that China Textile will take after the foreign exchange fluctuations and the surge in the cotton yarn black market. The private yarn mill industry, which is closely related to China Textile, is also very concerned about this. According to industry insiders, the listed prices of China Textile's yarn and cloth have not followed the sharp rise in exchange rates, and although the prices of private yarn mills have risen, they have been limited by this. The rise in the black market is due to the unwillingness of a few yarn mills to increase production on the one hand, and the creation of an atmosphere by unscrupulous brokers in the market on the other hand. In fact, actual sales have not increased. Various replication industries in this city are closed or have little work. From the perspective of supply and demand, there is no reason for price increases. Moreover, China Textile's production capacity has increased. After Deputy Manager Wu personally reorganized the Qingdao factories, production has also increased. Recently, many Qingdao goods have been matched with the goods distributed in this city, which can be taken as evidence. As for private yarn mills, they have abundant cotton in stock, and there is no problem with production. Unless there is external stimulus, the yarn and cloth market is expected to be stable. According to sources close to China Textile, the number of companies in the replication industries using yarn and cloth as raw materials, and those selling yarn and cloth as commodities, that have registered with China Textile through industry associations to obtain distribution quotas is as high as several thousand. When the market is bullish, requests for purchase are overwhelming, but when it is sluggish, few people come to the door. Since the foreign exchange fluctuations, people's hearts have been stimulated, and purchase requests have flocked in. The quantities they fill in on their purchase orders are often unreasonably large, so the company has to seriously reduce them, and distribute the entire number of factory numbers on the registration book in batches every other day to maintain order. The person in charge of China Textile stated that they must pay attention to production enterprises to prevent opportunists from reaping huge profits on the difference between listed and black market prices, and stated that they will seriously screen the qualifications of each factory number. The person in charge of the private cotton product replication industry stated that yarn prices have been rising for several months, while finished products are being dumped by foreign goods, and domestic sales are low. They cannot raise prices, so they are becoming increasingly weak in the face of the double attack. The industry has not improved after the foreign exchange fluctuations. If China Textile's listed prices do not stimulate the market, they can avoid accidents. It was also said that the reason why various factories have been requesting so much from China Textile recently is that they cannot bear the pressure of the black market. They hope that resale distribution can be effectively reduced, and production distribution can be put on the right track. As for those who distribute without factories, or those who apply for distribution while the factory is closed, they should be thoroughly reorganized. However, whether the selling business should be distributed in the same way as factories still needs to be considered by the authorities. According to well-informed sources, the cotton product replication industry is gathering opinions and planning to present them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Mayor Wu to balance yarn prices, and to ask China Textile to set an example.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Upward; Undervalued Stocks Show Stronger Gains</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks are still fluctuating. The situation of Mei Ya is gradually improving with the support of powerful banks. Various small stocks are flourishing within the scope of retail investment. The market prices of undervalued small and medium-sized investments are rising steadily, which also proves the impact of the resumption of trading. Popular stocks are rising and falling passively. In the morning, the low prices were Yong Sha 640 yuan, Mei Ya 3,600 yuan, Jingfu 210 yuan, Xin Guang 225 yuan, and Qin Xing 163 yuan. The high prices near noon were Yong Sha 675 yuan, Mei Ya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 240 yuan, Xin Guang 253 yuan, and Qin Xing 182 yuan. The market turned around near closing. As a result, Yong Sha rose slightly compared to the previous close, Mei Ya rose by half a percent, and Jingfu, Xin Guang, and Qin Xing each rose by more than half a percent. Undervalued small and medium-sized stocks each rose by between half a percent and one and a half percent, while Yuan Lao stocks also rose by around half a percent.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks opened poorly, but later, securities firms bought popular stocks, and the situation changed. Yi Sha rose from 8,300 to over 9,000, and Ying Lian rose from 8,600 to 9,500. As a result, Yi Sha, Ye Guang, Zhi Pi each rose by around half a percent compared to the previous close, Ying Lian rose by half a percent, Asia rose by one percent, and Gang Ye alone rose by two and a half percent and closed at the buying price.</p>
<h3>Unified Bing Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>When public bonds rose, a certain household on the seventh floor took the lead and sold more than 2 million yuan face value, taking advantage of the opportunity. Unified Bing bonds opened at 1,400 yuan in the morning, and then gradually declined from 1,400 yuan. There was some struggle in the middle, and it fell to 1,120 yuan. However, there was some support buying at the low, and it once rose back to 1,300 yuan, but finally hovered around 1,150 yuan. As a result, it fell by 210 yuan compared to the previous close. Unified Wu also fell from 1,050 yuan to 900 yuan, a decline of 150 yuan. Jia and Yi rose slightly by 30 yuan, while Ding remained flat.</p>
<h3>Stable Prices; New Rice Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of rice in the North and South markets remained slow. The South market received 2,177 shi, and the North market received 3,148 shi. The Social Affairs Bureau sold Brazilian rice at 52,000 yuan per bag: 410 bags in the South market and 1,300 bags in the North market. The Social Affairs Bureau also sold two types of Western rice: 70 bags of rice number 2 in the South market and 150 bags in the North market. Rice stores have large inventories and weak demand. The Social Affairs Bureau's distribution of foreign rice has led to a significant decrease in the number of applicants. Baiyuan goods are scarce and stable. High-quality new rice is still available, while medium and low grades have fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old rice is stable, but various early-season new rice from Nanjing, Liyang, and Jiaxing, Jiashan in Zhejiang, and Kunshan have arrived in Shanghai in small quantities, so new early rice has declined slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Because the quality of the rice from the port is very good, the decline has been small. The future trend is shifting. Yesterday, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau landing craft "Hua Zi No. 203" transported 3,159 bags of rice and grain from Nanjing, weighing 334 tons and 5975 kilograms. In addition, a barge, number 49, also transported 3,174 bags of rice and grain, weighing 289 tons and 1885 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Rayon Soars to One Million; Silk Weaving Industry Cannot Recover</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Silk weaving factories thought they could catch their breath a little after the extension of the foreign exchange period, but unexpectedly, rayon has suddenly soared in price recently. The price allocated by China Textile has increased by a huge amount of over one million per carton compared to the previous period. The asking price for 150-denier rayon was 1.27 million in the previous period, but it rose to 1.48 million yesterday, causing the black market to rise without end. In addition to enduring high labor costs and high interest rates, factories are suffering from high costs and all look worried.</p>
<h3>South Seas Silk Sales Show Slight Activity</h3>
<p>Australia and India have been gradually increasing their orders for silk fabrics from us. Last month, the silk industry in this city transported 50,000 bolts to Australia. Recently, Australia has ordered another batch of silk fabrics from the China Silk Company, and the quantity is said to be considerable.</p>
<p>In addition, the silk fabric markets in Australia and India were previously dominated by Japan, but now that Japan has no production, they are all ordering from us.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Brokers Urge Resumption of Trading</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] It is learned that some brokers of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange believe that the exchange is an organization that assists both yarn mills and cotton merchants in buying and selling. During the War of Resistance, they suspended business in accordance with government orders, which has been nine years. Now that the country has been recovered, it is urgent to resume business as soon as possible so as to fulfill the functions of the exchange and maintain the livelihoods of member brokers. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the brokers' association, urging them to prepare a plan for resumption of business as soon as possible so that they can contribute their opinions to the board of directors of the exchange and the competent ministry, and promote the early resumption of the exchange.</p>
<h3>Fellow Traders Tend to Resell; Yarn Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market softened slightly. People were shaken by attacks from public opinion, and fellow traders tended to resell. As a result, all types of yarn declined. At the same time, Tianjin yarn prices were weak, and Tianjin merchants in Shanghai were selling off their stocks, so all yarn except for Shuang Ma remained unchanged. The highest price for double-strand yarn was once hyped up to 2.18 million, but it closed at 2.1 million. At noon, Fangjian still sold yarn at the listed price, and all industries competed to purchase it.</p>
<p>The cloth market rose at first and then fell back, but actual sales were not very enthusiastic. However, there was demand for dark-colored goods in the north and south of the Yangtze River. V Longtou and Minfang had smoother consumption, but Fangjian's cloth supply was still sufficient, so the price increase was not large. However, the momentum of the notification list was increasing. There were more buyers in the morning, and then more people sold, and it fell back again. As a result, it rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Sugar Prices Remain Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the sugar market was still suspended by the trade association. There were only direct transactions between companies, with a little embellishment. The prices of green sugar are relatively tight because new supplies have been scarce and production prices have risen. The price rose by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan yesterday, while the prices of other red and white sugars also rose. The situation is expected to ease only when subsequent goods arrive.</p>
<h3>Firewood and Timber Prices Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Imported timber prices had briefly risen due to foreign exchange rate adjustments, but market transactions were sluggish, and prices quickly returned to their original levels. Domestic timber prices remained largely unchanged. Timber industry insiders claim the current market slump is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Kerosene retail prices have fallen. The quoted price for a five-gallon can was previously 15,000 yuan. Due to lack of buyers, retailers have already lowered prices by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan yesterday. It is reported that retailers purchase from distributors for 1,400 yuan per gallon, plus 4,000 yuan for the can, bringing the cost to only 11,000 yuan. However, gas stations still sell at 140 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Disrupted Supply from Longhai Railway Causes Surge in Soybean and Peanut Prices; Soybean Oil Prices Also Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, in the grain market, flour prices were soft due to the availability of miscellaneous brands, retreating slightly by a few hundred yuan. Factories haven't opened yet, and inventories are low. There was a slight appetite for wheat from Shantou and Ningbo, so market sentiment was clearly stable, though covertly tight. Supplies from all production areas are already dwindling. The north continues to select white wheat. Soybean supplies via the Longhai Railway are scarce, bolstering market confidence. Retail demand is strong, creating a situation where supply cannot keep up with demand, leading to a sharp increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Peanut prices also rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, as arrivals from Henan province were scarce. In the oil market, Qingdao raw oil arrivals continued, dropping by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil prices increased by 1,000 yuan, tracking the rise in raw materials. Vegetable oil, the lowest priced oil, saw a revival in sales, also rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes arrived at the docks, with a slight number of transactions, causing prices to rise by 100 to 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reducing High-Interest Loans: Interest Reduced to 13.5%</h3>
<p>Industry and commerce are currently suffering from four high costs: high wages, high taxes, high transportation costs, and high interest rates. The exemption of export taxes is considered a reduction in taxes. Regarding interest rates, local banks and financial institutions originally charged 16% interest (including handling fees) to their clients. The authorities have ordered a reduction, and the institutions requested it to be lowered to 14%. It has now been decided to reduce it to 13.5%, with no additional surcharges allowed.</p>
<p>Loan Agreement for Salt Including Amount, Term, Interest, Region, Method, and Guarantee Submitted for Signature</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The 21.2 billion yuan salt loan jointly organized by the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai salt loan banking syndicate is currently being taken to Beijing for signature by Yu Tianyun, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, along with the loan agreement. The total loan amount of 21.2 billion yuan consists of 16.8 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans and 4.4 billion yuan for production loans. The distribution of the 16.8 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans to various salt sales areas is as follows: Hunan 4.03 billion yuan, Hubei 5.04 billion yuan, Jiangxi 2.3 billion yuan, Anhui 3.03 billion yuan, Jiangsu (five counties) 1.9 billion yuan, Xiaguan and Jiangning area 500 million yuan. The term of the agreement is set at six months. However, the term of each individual loan cannot exceed four months. Salt merchants registered with the Salt Administration and holding a guarantee letter from the local salt affairs agency are eligible to apply for loans. Loans can be obtained through remittance, deposit, overdraft, and discounting methods. The loan amount per dan (unit of weight) of salt is calculated at 70% of the actual cost of the transportation merchant at the time, plus transportation fees. The monthly interest rate is 4.5%. The remittance fee is 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and the handling fee is 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Salt deposit remittances are temporarily limited to salt transported from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Huai, and Shandong production areas to Shanghai for sale, or from Shanghai to Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Hankou, Yuezhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other areas.</p>
<h3>Tightening Credit and Flat Gold and Currency Markets</h3>
<p>Gold prices were sluggish yesterday. The opening price was 2.165 million, rising slightly from 2.16 million, with the high reaching only 2.178 million before facing downward pressure. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 141 bars at a price of 2.1575 million, after which the market became even more lackluster. Transactions were scarce, fluctuating between 2.16 million and 2.17 million. The market was initially weak and then stabilized in the afternoon, with little change compared to the previous day. Prices for gold ornaments, refined silver, and silver dollars remained flat. The informal credit market was slightly tighter, with informal interest rates rising slightly to around 13%.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange rates were also stable. The opening price for US dollars was 3,380 yuan for buying and 3,400 yuan for selling. Prices briefly rose to 3,410 yuan before slightly decreasing following gold prices. The situation remained remarkably stable, fluctuating between 3,380 yuan and 3,400 yuan until noon. Prices slightly decreased in the afternoon, hovering around 3,390 yuan, ending 15 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong dollar prices have retreated, falling from 770 yuan to below 750 yuan, eventually recovering slightly by 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates remain firm, between 750 yuan and 76 yuan. Indian exchange rates are 900 yuan to 920 yuan. British exchange rates are offered at 12,200 yuan. US exchange rates are still settled at the official rate.</p>
<h3>Artificial Butter: Monthly Production of 600 Tons, Cost Half That of Real Butter - A Miracle of the Nazi Era</h3>
<p>[United Press, Weiden, Germany, 22nd] A factory in the British occupation zone was discovered producing butter from coal, known as the Inhersohn factory. According to British officers, the butter produced is excellent and indistinguishable from real butter. The factory is located in the Ruhr area and has been shut down since Germany surrendered and the war ended. The British are currently trying to restore it. According to Dr. Inhersohn, the factory manager, the factory could produce 600 tons of butter per month during the war, at half the cost of natural butter.</p>
<h3>Refined Tung Oil: A New Venture for Sichuan Exporters</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 22nd] Some exporters in the city believe that Sichuan's past exports of tung oil have all been crude, containing impurities or proteins, making it unsuitable for use in paint. To improve quality, they are planning to raise funds to establish refined tung oil plants in Wanxian, Chongqing, and Fuling. All parties believe this is timely.</p>
<h3>Longan Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Although there have been sporadic sales of miscellaneous Longan recently, the quantity is not large, and the supply is also limited. As the old and new harvests are transitioning, there is a sense of supply not meeting demand, and prices have gradually increased. Yesterday, the market opening price increased by another 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Aged Pearl Tea: Market in Africa; Taiwan Red Tea Trading Also Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign tea firms, including Chinese merchants like Yongfa, have received telegrams from Africa stating that there is a strong preference for aged pearl tea, with a willingness to accept any quantity offered. The prices offered are not far from what the suppliers want, and it is feared that a considerable quantity will be shipped overseas soon. As for the Taiwan fine red tea, which has been actively purchased by Indian firms for several days, the market inventory is dwindling. However, demand remains strong, and coarse red tea and scented tea are temporarily used to fill the gap. Therefore, the trading of the above varieties is becoming increasingly popular, and the collection of other varieties is extremely urgent, creating a uniformly active market atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Excessive License Fees: Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Exemption Based on Legal Grounds</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The City Chamber of Commerce held a discussion meeting regarding business license fees yesterday at 3:00 PM, gathering representatives from relevant associations, including warehouse, hardware, industrial, silk, Western clothing, hardware parts, shipping forwarding, northern goods, radio, electrical appliance, clock, shoe, egg, auto parts disassembly, and steel industries. According to Secretary-General Yan of the Chamber of Commerce, the industries convened are not legally subject to business license fees, but the City Finance Bureau's collection rules include them. Therefore, the meeting was held to allow each industry to report on the fee collection process. It is understood that the Finance Bureau has not yet universally collected the fees, but none of the industries legally exempt from the fees have paid. It has now been decided that the Chamber of Commerce will resubmit the situation to the City Finance Bureau and the Ministry of Finance for approval of exemption.</p>
<p>Detailed Order for Purchasing Raw Silk Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai; Autumn Cocoon Loan Decided to Continue as Planned</p>
<p>According to information from the China Sericulture Business Office, the office and the China Trust Bureau have not yet received the detailed order regarding the purchase of raw silk. According to the office's speculation, the purchase situation will likely be based on the manufacturer's costs, since the Spring cocoon loans and reeling labor loans were all government-funded, and the accounts of factories in various regions have mostly not been cleared yet. The government is now purchasing, so it's simply a matter of finding and paying.</p>
<p>The autumn cocoon loan will not be suspended due to the increase in foreign exchange rates. Detailed plans and implementation measures have been jointly discussed by relevant parties, and the interest rate will be lower than that of the spring cocoon loan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fishery Loan: Cooperative Handles a Total of 40 Million</h3>
<p>The 200 million yuan fishery loan organized by the China Farmers Bank is loaned to fishermen related to the Shanghai Fish Market, with the Shanghai Fish Market acting as the repayment guarantor. It has been three months, and the results are excellent. Now, a representative from the Ningbo Fish Market has come to Shanghai to negotiate with the China Farmers Bank, intending to follow the same example and lend 100 million yuan. The China Farmers Bank agreed to lend 40 million yuan, using the Ningbo Cooperative as the borrower. The loan method involves the cooperative borrowing from the China Farmers Bank at an interest rate of 4%, and the cooperative lending to fishermen, with a term of three months. There are two types of loans: credit loans and mortgage loans. Credit loans require a reliable store as guarantor, and mortgage loans use the fishermen's products and fishing gear as collateral. Repayments must not be overdue by more than two periods (i.e., six months). The funds borrowed by the fishermen are limited to repairing fishing boats, purchasing fishing gear, storing and purchasing grain, and purchasing fish salt and bait. The maximum loan amount in Shanghai is set at 500,000 yuan, while Ningbo is lower. The exact amount is being discussed by the lending agency.</p>
<h3>First Shipment of Japanese Tea to the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yokohama, 22nd] The first shipment of tea from Japan since the war, 15,000 boxes, has been shipped to the United States aboard the Victory ship "Jackson". This batch of tea was loaded in Shizuoka Prefecture, which produces 85% of Japan's total tea output.</p>
<h3>World Timber Shortage</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The head of the US Forest Service, Watts, said that the world's timber shortage is becoming increasingly apparent, posing a major threat to construction projects. He said that South America and Africa still have many forests, but large forests in China and India have been severely damaged. Stocks in the United States and Canada are declining daily. Australia and South Africa are already seeking supplies from abroad. Although South America has reserves, it is unable to export them due to a lack of labor.</p>

<h3>The Tumultuous "CNRA"</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pingzhai</p>
<p>On November 9, 1943, representatives from forty-four United Nations countries gathered at the Presidential Palace in the United States to sign the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Agreement. Following this, the representatives went to Atlantic City for the First International Relief and Rehabilitation Conference. At this conference, a historically unprecedented undertaking was decided: the establishment of "UNRRA." Under this organization, the forty-four countries worked together to manage systematic and planned relief and rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<h3>A Grand Experiment</h3>
<p>In March 1944, the Relief and Rehabilitation Survey and Design Committee of the Chinese Executive Yuan began its work, with Mr. Jiang Tingfu as the chairman. However, as Mr. Jiang was in the United States at the time negotiating externally, Mr. Gu Jigaoc, the General Manager of the Farmers Bank of China, was actually in charge of the committee's affairs. He worked with senior officials from more than ten relevant ministries and commissions, as well as three experts dispatched by UNRRA, to produce a detailed report. According to this report, the cost of relief and rehabilitation in China would require a total of US$2.5 billion, plus 2.7 billion pre-war purchasing power in legal tender.</p>
<p>However, UNRRA's total funds amounted to only US$2 billion.</p>
<p>As a result, China submitted the report to UNRRA on September 30. The plan and budget of the Survey and Design Committee were largely maintained, but China expressed its hope that UNRRA would assist with US$945 million, with the remaining portion to be raised by the Chinese government and people.</p>
<p>UNRRA accepted China's request. In January 1945, the organization responsible for executing this relief and rehabilitation task was finally established: the "Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (CNRA), often referred to as "行總" (Xingzong).</p>
<p>The work of CNRA was arduous and important, because if the organization was successful, China could quickly recover its vitality during this unprecedented opportunity. Conversely, if it failed, not only would the Chinese people suffer more displacement and starvation, but China's position among the United Nations would plummet. Furthermore, in other new experiments, the lessons from failure could be used as a reference for the next effort, ultimately contributing to eventual success. However, there were few opportunities for improvement when running CNRA, because the experimental period was only three years at most. Even if errors were discovered and corrections were immediately initiated, it was often too late.</p>
<h3>How to Proceed?</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang was not unaware of the difficulties CNRA might encounter. In his booklet "The Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration - What to Do? How to Do It?" he first pointed out three conditions that CNRA should possess: First, it should act quickly, because "if we cannot complete the things we should do within two years, we will not be able to obtain UNRRA's assistance." Second, CNRA should sincerely cooperate with other ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan, avoiding friction and, especially, conflict, and preventing all pointless and unnecessary disputes. He clearly stated: "Based on experience, I know that it is not easy for organizations to divide labor, and cooperation is even more difficult. This endeavor is particularly complex because we must not only carry out relief work domestically, but also deal with UNRRA and its affiliated assemblies, committees, and offices abroad." Third, CNRA personnel must be honest and incorruptible. He said, "If unfortunately there are cases of corruption, not only is the loss of materials regrettable, but the government's loss of reputation internationally is even more regrettable." At the same time, he pointed out that having materials without personnel would not make the endeavor a success. He believed that when CNRA's business was fully launched, it would need about 1,500 foreign experts. He believed that if this experiment of extensively employing foreign advisers could succeed, it would become one of CNRA's important contributions.</p>
<p>That booklet was published in July 1945. Mr. Jiang's meticulous planning and enthusiasm for the endeavor encouraged the people across the nation, who were in dire straits, and various places called for CNRA to start working quickly, with a sense of hope. Moreover, because the enemy surrendered quickly, it was even more necessary to immediately advance these efforts.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1945, CNRA arrived in Shanghai, which had recently been liberated. In mid-December, it began selling low-priced flour in Shanghai, and vaccines were shipped from Shanghai to Hankou, Guangdong, and other places. Fifteen CNRA branch offices were successively established in the recovered areas, and the work accelerated. When Mr. Jiang arrived in Shanghai and hosted reporters with Mr. Han Reisheng, then Deputy Director of UNRRA, Mr. Jiang said, "UNRRA will have a large number of aid materials coming to China, and the plan can definitely be implemented." Then, he said, "There will be no famine in China in the next year or two."</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of people who had been trampled under the iron hooves of the god of war for eight years had indeed shed tears of gratitude after hearing these promises!</p>
<h3>What to Do?</h3>
<p>One of the most striking features of this post-war relief effort is that it differs from previous disaster relief efforts in that it is "systematic and planned." "Systematic" can be included in "planned," so what exactly is the content of this "plan"—what does the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) intend to do?</p>
<p>On September 30, 1944, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the government, submitted a document to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), titled "China Post-War Relief Plan"—a total of eleven volumes! And "various data are not yet complete."</p>
<p>According to this plan, the scope of relief extends north to Heilongjiang, south to Guangdong and Guangxi, west to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and east to Taiwan, divided into eleven districts. The total population of these eleven districts is 461 million, of which 266 million in the occupied areas are in urgent need of relief. The items for which UNRRA's assistance is hoped are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Food—In the initial twelve months, the hope is to import 3,270,000 metric tons. This includes not only rice and wheat but also 25,000 metric tons of fish and meat. Special attention is paid to the nutrition of women and infants, with milk powder and meat broth powder (annual request for 40,000 metric tons), as well as cod liver oil, calcium tablets, and sugar. The total value is over US$150 million. By the end of June of this year, 918,978 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, only 378,235 tons had arrived, barely four-tenths of the original amount.</p>
<p>2.  Clothing—China requests the United Nations to provide cotton, cotton cloth, spindles (400,000), spare parts, sewing machines, thread, and needles, totaling 140,000 metric tons, worth over US$150 million. (By the end of June, 135,424 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, only 39,033 tons had arrived, less than three-tenths of the original amount.)</p>
<p>3.  Housing—Divided into two categories: first, temporary accommodation, with stations set up at various water and land transportation hubs for refugees to stay overnight during their journey. Second, assistance to the people in repairing, renovating, and rebuilding their houses destroyed by the war. Here, China requests the United Nations to provide 50,000 metric tons of materials, worth US$5 million.</p>
<p>4.  Medical and Health—To carry out medical relief, epidemic prevention, maternal and child health, and drug relief, while also training personnel, a total of 74,000 metric tons of materials are requested, valued at US$66 million, and the United Nations is asked to assist in hiring 725 foreign experts. (By the end of June, 14,721 tons should have been shipped to China, and by the end of May, 13,988 tons had already arrived.)</p>
<p>5.  Transportation—This is the most important item in China's request for assistance, including railway networks, highway networks, and water transport equipment. The figure for which China requests UNRRA's assistance is 1.6 million metric tons of materials, valued at US$330 million, which is almost equivalent to the sum of food, clothing, and housing assistance. (By the end of August this year, 734,309 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, less than one-third had arrived, totaling 179,325 tons.)</p>
<p>6.  Agriculture—The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) hopes to achieve (1) increased food production (including grains, vegetables, livestock, and fish), (2) increased production of clothing materials (including cotton, silk, wool, etc.), (3) increased production of export goods to seek foreign exchange to pay for essential imports, and (4) restoration of rural agriculture to alleviate farmers' hardship and stabilize the rural economy. It requests the United Nations to provide 660,000 metric tons of materials, valued at US$77 million. At the same time, it requests the assistance of 39 foreign experts to work in China and to sponsor 59 Chinese experts to study abroad.</p>
<p>7.  Industry—The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) plans to establish some modern industries, including flour mills, oil presses, sugar refineries, cotton spinning mills, wool spinning mills, cement plants, sawmills, brick factories, glass factories, coal mines, power plants, water plants, machine factories, electrical equipment factories, steel mills, fertilizer factories, soda ash plants, caustic soda plants, soap factories, paper mills, and rubber factories. It requires 8,022 Chinese engineers and 26,983 technicians and plans to invite 351 foreign engineers and 729 technicians. The requested assistance from UNRRA is 190,000 tons of equipment, valued at US$115 million.</p>
<p>8.  Flooded Areas—Including the Yellow River Huayuankou closure, dike restoration, Huai River repair, and drainage improvement projects in the Yu-Wan flooded area. The assistance required in terms of equipment is approximately US$4 million, weighing 9,000 metric tons. It also needs to hire one or two foreign engineers and twenty technicians. The plan specifically points out in this section: "The national currency portion of the funding is very large, totaling 68 million national currency. If UNRRA's assistance in food can be used for work relief, the national currency expenditure can be greatly reduced. It is estimated that the rice, wheat, and other grains needed for this project total 109,000 tons."</p>
<p>9.  Social Welfare—Including relief for orphaned children, the disabled, etc. The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) plans to establish 30 regional relief teams, 300 county welfare relief service centers, and 800 village and town relief groups, requiring a total of 7,000 personnel. In addition, it will provide household utensils and tools for the people to make a living, and it will set up 500 nurseries, each accommodating 500 children. For assistance in refugees returning home, 500 refugee reception centers will be set up. 500 food supply stations will provide two meals a day for 1,000 people each. In addition, five training centers for the disabled will be established. The assistance requested from UNRRA is 27,000 tons of materials, valued at US$32 million, and it plans to hire 230 foreign experts and sponsor 100 Chinese experts to study abroad.</p>
<p>10. Refugees—Reception centers and relief supplies require assistance valued at US$5.6 million, including 1,000 tons of materials.</p>
<p>The total amount of foreign-imported materials needed for China's post-war relief and rehabilitation efforts within eighteen months is US$2,530,000,000, totaling 10,000,000 metric tons. China's request for assistance to UNRRA is only 37% of this amount, totaling US$945,000,000, weighing 4,000,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>After this plan was announced in the United States, public opinion paid close attention to it. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "At that time, the feelings of all parties can be summarized in two sentences: (1) How large are the numbers! (2) Considering China's long war of resistance and the size of the war zone, the numbers are within reason."</p>
<p>However, despite being "within reason," UNRRA made an "unexpected" decision. They discounted our already discounted numbers by another 60%, approving only US$560 million for this US$945 million request. Moreover, many of the materials shipped were not in the original plan. As a result, the work that the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) can do has become simply processing and transporting the materials shipped by UNRRA to the places where they are needed.</p>
<h3>"Exceeded Expectations"</h3>
<p>Three months later, the situation has turned to a very serious stage. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek frankly and sincerely pointed out the seriousness of the global food problem. He admitted that "the actual need for food has exceeded the amount previously estimated," while what UNRRA can supply is far below the original plan. Therefore, he had to take the opportunity to go abroad to attend the fourth UNRRA General Assembly to personally promote the issue of food assistance.</p>
<p>He said, "The situation facing us is more serious and more difficult than planned." The destruction of railways, houses, cities... etc. has all exceeded initial estimates, especially in provinces such as Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Henan. UNRRA is unable to supply the bricks, tiles, and wood needed to build Chinese-style houses.</p>
<p>New difficulties have also arisen when sending refugees back. Detailed statistics on refugees are not available, and cases of impersonating refugees have been discovered in Chongqing. In Hankou, people were found doing business with morphine and heroin among the refugees.</p>
<p>The transportation situation is also very serious. Land transportation has been completely destroyed by the war, but there are not enough ships urgently needed in inland rivers and coastal areas. This difficulty forced the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) to rely on the ships of Swire and Jardine Matheson for help, which immediately caused fierce protests from the shipping association, triggering a huge wave of defending inland river shipping rights.</p>
<p>These difficulties were personally pointed out by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in his speech to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) personnel in Shanghai on March 7. After delivering this speech, he rushed to the United States. On April 17, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek told a United Press reporter in the United States, "I am here in the United States on behalf of China to request a continuous supply of food, but I must admit that the mission I bear has failed. UNRRA has reduced the amount requested by China, and the British-American-Canadian Joint Food Committee has further reduced it. We requested 500,000 tons of fertilizer, but only received 10,000 tons. Britain is unwilling to provide China with surplus grain from Siam due to political and economic reasons..." After former US President Hoover investigated the food situation in China, Kilpatrick, the American representative who came to Shanghai to attend the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, said on May 25, "Washington is deeply convinced that the food shortage in China is very serious, but whether this will lead to an increase in rations depends on the improvement of the global food situation."</p>
<p>However, in Hunan, northern Jiangsu, Guangxi, Jiangxi... thirty million starving people are struggling every day, and the bark and roots of trees are almost eaten up!</p>

<h3>"A Powerful Organization"</h3>
<p>When preparing to organize the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "What we need is a powerful organization that is less administrative and more business-oriented."</p>
<p>Under this principle, the organization of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is relatively new and special. Its internal units are divided into four "departments": Storage and Transportation, Distribution, Finance, and Disaster Relief. There are also four "sections": General Affairs, Accounting, Investigation, and Translation. In addition, there are three committees for Industry and Mining, Agriculture, and Health, as well as a personnel office. The Storage and Transportation Department is responsible for checking and receiving materials and transporting them to the places where they are used. The Storage and Transportation Department sets up several storage and transportation bureaus in key transportation locations. The Distribution Department is responsible for deciding on the amount to be distributed and the order of priority based on the needs of various provinces, cities, counties, and various undertakings. The Finance Department is in charge of the sale of materials and the use of the proceeds. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that the purpose of this move is "first, to assist other government agencies in stabilizing prices, and second, to raise funds for work relief projects." The Disaster Relief Department is responsible for handling emergency relief, helping refugees return home, and planning work relief. In charge of all the affairs of the entire administration is the director, who is assisted by two deputy directors in everything. In addition, there is an executive director who is responsible for carrying out all business and supervising the various departments and sub-administrations. The sale of materials must also be approved by the executive director first. In addition, the Executive Yuan also sends a representative to work in the Distribution Department of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), and the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) also sends a representative to the Executive Yuan to be responsible for liaison, much like countries sending envoys to each other to handle diplomacy.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also counselors, secretaries, department directors, deputy department directors, section chiefs, inspectors, technical officers, section chiefs, editors, technicians, and clerks—as well as hired domestic and foreign specialists and employees. The UNRRA office in China also sends "consultants" to various departments to "observe."</p>
<p>In addition, in areas more severely damaged by the war, the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has also established fifteen sub-administrations (Northeast, Taiwan, Ji-Re-Ping-Jin, Jin-Sui-Cha, Lu-Qing, Henan, Shanghai, Su-Ning, Zhe-Min, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi), with four groups under them: Relief Affairs, Storage and Transportation, Health, and General Affairs, as well as several work teams, each responsible by group leaders, deputy group leaders, and team leaders.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also secretaries, inspectors, technical officers, technicians, group members, and employees.</p>
<p>In areas where there are no sub-administrations of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), a "Post-War Relief Review Committee" is established, with members selected by the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) from among people of prestige in various political, military, and social circles in the area.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking Shanghai as an example, there is the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) headquarters, the Shanghai sub-administration of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), plus the UNRRA office in China. When you get to Zhenjiang, there is the Su-Ning sub-administration of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), and when you get to Nanjing, there is still a part of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) headquarters.</p>
<p>To give another smaller example: the headquarters in Shanghai has a Storage and Transportation Department, the Shanghai sub-administration has a Storage and Transportation Group, and Shanghai also has a Storage and Transportation Bureau (because Shanghai is a place with a lot of material to be loaded and unloaded).</p>
<p>The duties of the director and the executive director are difficult to define, especially in recent months, the powers of the executive director seem to have waxed and waned. Recently, it seems that the director has become the chairman of the National Government, and the executive director seems to be the premier of the Executive Yuan, but the heads of various departments under this "Executive Yuan" are appointed by the director, who took office earlier than the executive director.</p>
<p>As a result, official documents are constantly going in circles, and when something goes wrong, it is often very easy to shirk responsibility.</p>
<h3>It Depends on Human Effort</h3>
<p>With such a large organization and such a difficult task, the problem of personnel is of course very important. In his book "The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總)—What to Do? How to Do It?" Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's first chapter is "Human Power Can Overcome Nature," and the last chapter is still "It Depends on Human Effort," which shows his emphasis on the problem of "people." The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has indeed recruited many outstanding talents. They are enthusiastic, capable, and many of them have already achieved considerable success and status in various undertakings.</p>
<p>However, even in this new organization, the most annoying phenomenon inherited from the Chinese bureaucracy—sectarianism—has not been able to be avoided. In addition, this organization is also "using both personnel who have passed the civil service examination and personnel who have not passed the civil service examination," so it is not easy to be closely integrated, and therefore it is impossible to exert the highest degree of efficiency. Moreover, the organization of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is temporary in nature, and many people who can find a more permanent position are unwilling to work for the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). Even those who are currently working for the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) often try to find a more permanent position. The mentality of "a five-day magistrate" more or less exists in the hearts of every employee of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). As for the many people who are trying to join the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) every day, as Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, they want to become officials. This phenomenon is more obvious in the several sub-administrations that are "far from the emperor." We only need to look through the records of the questioning during the meetings of the provincial assemblies to find that the most fiercely attacked at present is not other agencies, but the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), which specifically goes to these provinces to save the people. The individual heads of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) sub-administrations who have been criticized are not few, but we have not seen the headquarters resolutely replace them. Of course, the headquarters may have other difficulties, but the fundamental lack of a suitable successor must also be one of the main reasons.</p>

<h3>We Need Foreign Experts to Help</h3>
<p>Precisely because there are not enough good talents, some people just come to work every day, perfunctorily deal with things, and then leave. There are also some people among the field staff who are causing controversy. The Storage and Transportation Bureau in Shanghai is even more full of shady deals, and people are gossiping. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has recruited many "guest ministers" to make up for the lack of talent, but unexpectedly, even among the guest ministers, there have been unpleasant incidents that have caused UNRRA to have to send someone to audit the accounts.</p>
<p>Recently, after UNRRA ordered the suspension of material shipments to China, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was unexpectedly criticized by foreign reporters at a press conference for the statistical figures in his report not matching UNRRA's figures. Although it was later found out that it was due to the use of light tons and heavy tons, in this situation, we cannot but point out that the officials in charge of storage and transportation in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) are too negligent. This kind of negligence could have caused serious misunderstandings, especially when UNRRA's perception of us was most easily provoked! If the director of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) often receives such careless information and statistics, can the consequences be imagined?</p>
<p>There are many employees in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), but how many are really working hard and diligently? Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "The agency in charge of post-war relief and rehabilitation cannot be used as a relief agency for the unemployed." However, there are people in Zhenjiang and Guangzhou who have said that the Relief Administration has become the "Relief of the Administration." I am unwilling to criticize the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) with this irresponsible criticism, but I hope that the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) authorities will make up their minds in the few remaining months and use facts to eliminate this criticism!</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "When the business of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is fully developed, there will be 1,500 foreign experts serving here." These foreign experts do not necessarily work in the agencies affiliated with the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). Many of them are invited from abroad by the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) after consultation with the various ministries of the Executive Yuan and work in these departments—such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Health Administration. However, as of the end of May this year, only about 400 foreign experts had arrived in China.</p>
<p>China's science is backward, and the lack of technical personnel is an undeniable fact. Among the experts who have been invited to China, there are indeed many who are driven by enthusiasm and want to do a good job in China. For example, Mr. Todd, the engineer in charge of the Yellow River closure project, is truly hardworking and has made great efforts to cope with all aspects. He fully demonstrates the friendship of the allied countries to China. The American magazine "Time" praised him as "succeeding Dayu," which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>However, there are obviously areas that need to be improved in the procedures for sending these experts to China. As far as we know, they often do not notify the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) before coming to China, and the procedures for UNRRA's material assistance are not fully coordinated. The experts often arrive suddenly, and there are naturally delays in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) assigning them positions. For example, when many fisheries experts arrive, the machines they need to teach how to use are often not available. Of course, there are also cases where there are machines but no one to instruct how to use them. The funds are wasted, and the time of these experts is also wasted.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many foreign employees in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) who are not experts, such as typists, stenographers, inspectors... etc., and the number is quite considerable. Some of them are "borrowed" by UNRRA to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), especially military personnel. The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has to provide them with fairly good dormitories and meals, and if this expense could be used to hire Chinese employees, it may not be possible to use fairly outstanding talents. Most of these foreign personnel do not have a deep understanding of the progress of Chinese affairs, but their feelings are often very deep. As a result, they feel that everything is not going smoothly, while the Chinese employees spend a lot of time on translation and explanation. Now almost every document of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has to have both Chinese and English versions. How much time, money, and manpower is wasted?</p>
<p>For example, asking a foreign inspector to go out and investigate the work of the sub-administration, and this inspector may be the first time to come to China, how much can he know? Even if someone is really cheating, he may not be able to see through the bottom line?</p>
<p>And these foreign personnel, in many small places, because of various relationships, often make the Chinese employees of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) cast sidelong glances. For example, they are used to riding cars in their own country, so when they come to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), they must take a jeep whenever they go out, while Chinese employees must write a note and get it approved if they want to take a car. Although their position is high, they are often not as free as a small foreign typist—it is clearly an agency affiliated with the Executive Yuan, but it has taken on the style of a foreign firm!</p>
<h3>Beyond Politics, One Heart and Mind</h3>
<p>In his introduction to Mr. Li Men, the first director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Mr. Chiang said, "Mr. Li Men previously served as the Governor of New York State for eight years and has rich administrative experience. His political ideas are also very close to those of the late President Roosevelt. He is now detached from politics, leading UNRRA with one heart and mind to seek the well-being of the suffering people after the war." Indeed, to ensure that relief and rehabilitation work is done well, "detachment from politics" and "one heart and mind" are necessary conditions. However, "detachment from politics" is a very difficult thing.</p>
<p>When the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) transports supplies in mainland China, it often encounters situations where it is blocked and intercepted by the military. Machines used for river management are also blown up. Restoring transportation networks such as railways and highways was originally the largest part of CNRRA's plan, requiring far more assistance from UNRRA than the total amount of food and clothing requested. But how complex are the political relationships included in this transportation restoration issue?</p>
<p>If the transportation problem cannot be solved, then widespread relief is out of the question. Relief supplies designated for Guangxi arrived in Guangdong, and the Guangdong branch of CNRRA intercepted them for the people of Guangdong, leaving Guangxi with nothing. Mayor Wu of Shanghai once said that if the rice and grain really did not arrive, he would decide to use CNRRA's food first. Although this matter was not actually implemented, the author saw Mayor Wu's expression when he said these words that day—he really intended to do so. [Continued on Page 9]</p>

<h3>An Outline of Mountain Administration in Taiwan Province: New Cells of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>— Taiwan Air Dispatch, 18th, by He Minxian</p>
<p>The mountain people of Taiwan Province (referred to as "aborigines" by the Japanese) comprise seven tribes, with a population of 151,470, scattered throughout the mountainous areas of various counties. In the past, the Japanese discriminated against them as an inferior race, established a "Department of Aboriginal Affairs" to implement special administrative measures, controlled everything with the police, and adopted a policy of both appeasement and isolation, with very little interaction with the residents of the plains. They established trading posts to control their economy and established educational institutions to imprison their minds. For fifty years, the initial Japanese oppression and suppression, followed by education and industry promotion, aimed to alienate their hearts, enslave their minds, and gradually eliminate and exterminate them. Therefore, to this day, the culture of these tribes remains backward, production is poor, and they still live a primitive life. After the restoration, Governor Chen of Taiwan Province, recognizing this, based on the principle of ethnic equality, decided to universalize education, emphasize hygiene, guide production, and improve living conditions to help them become self-reliant and raise their intellectual standards. At the same time, he organized mountain inspection teams and a Mountain Administration Research Committee, sending personnel to the mountains with goods to comfort the people and conduct on-the-ground investigations as a basis for policy implementation. In recent months, the planning, implementation, and results of mountain administration in Taiwan Province have been of interest to readers everywhere. The following is a report based on interviews with relevant parties by the reporter:</p>
<p>Investigation and Research: The Mountain Inspection Team was organized by one person from each department, bureau, and committee, totaling more than twenty people. They departed in three groups in February of this year. Each group had a leader and members. The first group went to the mountainous areas of Taipei, Hsinchu, and Taichung counties; the second group went to the Alishan area of Chiayi; and the third group went to the Hualien area. The journey lasted for half a month, covering more than 500 kilometers. Each member experienced hardships and dangers, penetrating deep into the mountains. Fortunately, the results were satisfactory. After the inspection, the opinions and requests of representatives of various tribes were combined, and the actual situation and experiences of the inspection were carefully studied. A detailed and concrete "Outline of Mountain Administrative Facility Plans" was drafted as a guideline for implementation.</p>
<p>Five-Year Plan: The Provincial Governor's Office, to assist mountain compatriots, raise their culture, and improve their lives so that they are equal to their counterparts in the plains, has specially formulated the "Outline of Mountain Administrative Facility Plans in Taiwan Province" for implementation. It contains detailed, appropriate, and thorough plans regarding the objects and steps of the facilities. It was decided to strengthen various facilities through ordinary administrative methods, with an initial period of five years. The results of the implementation will be followed by a second phase of the plan, aiming to raise the intellectual level and living ability of mountain compatriots to the same level as the people in the plains within a short period of ten years.</p>
<p>Distribution of the Seven Tribes: The targets of the mountain administrative facilities are the seven tribes, as mentioned before, living in the high mountains. Their distribution areas are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tayal Tribe—Distributed in Wenshan, Luodong, and Suao in Taipei County; Daxi, Zhudong, and Dahu in Hsinchu County; Dongshi in Taichung County; Nenghao in Taichung County; and Hualien in Hualien Port.</p>
<p>(2) Bunun Tribe—Distributed in Nenghao, Xingao, Fenglin and Yuli in Hualien County; and Taitung in Taitung County.</p>
<p>(3) Tsou Tribe—Distributed in Chiayi in Tainan County and Qishan in Kaohsiung County.</p>
<p>(4) Paiwan Tribe—Distributed in Qishan in Kaohsiung County, Pingtung, Chaozhou, Hengchun, and Taitung in Taitung.</p>
<p>(5) Amis Tribe—Distributed in Hualien, Fenglin, and Yuli in Hualien County, and Xingang in Taitung County.</p>
<p>(6) Yami Tribe—Concentrated on Hongtou Island in the Taitung District of Taitung County.</p>
<p>(7) Saisiyat Tribe—Concentrated in Zhunan District of Hsinchu County.</p>
<p>Implementation Steps: Now that the mountain administration plan has been determined, the steps for administrative facilities have also been carefully and prudently considered, differentiating between urgency and importance, and are specified in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Organization—The Department of Civil Affairs invites relevant departments, bureaus, and offices to organize a Mountain Administration Research Committee to study and improve various mountain facilities. It also organizes a Mountain Administration Inspection Team to investigate the actual conditions in the mountains, integrate research, and improve mountain administrative facilities.</p>
<p>(2) Autonomy—Construct mountain autonomous institutions, organize township public offices and village offices, prepare for local autonomous undertakings in the mountains, and elect township representatives to establish representative bodies.</p>
<p>(3) Training—Train mountain autonomous personnel, establish a mountain personnel system to ensure peace of mind, and increase the salaries of mountain workers to encourage motivated young people to serve.</p>
<p>(4) Education—The "Aboriginal Children's Education Centers" previously run by the Japanese in mountain villages will be uniformly converted into national schools, and adult education will be conducted. Promote the National Language and National Script Movement, and establish the same facilities as those in the plains. Abolish the Japanese system of discriminating against mountain compatriots to raise the cultural level of mountain compatriots. Establish secondary schools to cultivate mountain youth, and establish public-funded scholarships to encourage them to study at universities.</p>
<p>(5) Health—Establish health clinics and malaria prevention centers in mountain villages, and organize a mountain mobile medical team by the province to provide regular medical care and guide mountain compatriots in basic hygiene knowledge to promote their physical health.</p>
<p>(6) Cooperation—Guide the organization of mountain village cooperatives to handle the supply and sales of mountain materials, so that the economic organization of mountain compatriots can be established, avoid exploitation by merchants, and improve their lives.</p>
<p>(7) Production—Expand mountain production undertakings, establish agricultural training centers and vocational training centers in mountain areas of each county, cultivate specialized agricultural technicians in mountain areas, develop mountain industries, and improve various mountain handicrafts to increase the income of mountain compatriots.</p>
<p>(8) Transportation—Construct mountain roads and bridges to facilitate mountain transportation.</p>
<p>(9) Self-Defense—To strengthen the self-defense capabilities of mountain areas, train mountain police personnel and send them back to the mountains to engage in security work to improve their self-defense capabilities.</p>
<p>(10) Customs—The customs and habits of mountain compatriots are different from those of the plains, and have been followed for a long time, which is an important obstacle to ethnic assimilation. Actively find ways to reform their bad customs and habits.</p>
<p>Administrative Organization: To meet the needs of the current stage and to coordinate with the implementation of the five-year plan in order to develop in parallel with the plains, the organization has been strengthened to meet the needs and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(1) At the Provincial Level—Initially, the first section of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Administrative Governor's Office took over the affairs of the Aboriginal Affairs Section of the former Taiwan Governor-General's Office and established a Mountain Administration Section to handle mountain administrative affairs. The relevant units still cooperated with each department to handle it. Recently, in order to focus on the implementation of mountain administrative work, the original Mountain Administration Section has been changed to the Third Section to handle it, still cooperating with each department to work together, so that mountain administration and plain administration have the same facilities, eliminating the discriminatory concepts of the past Japanese government and implementing the spirit of ethnic equality.</p>
<p>(2) At the County Level—Each county government (section) of the Civil Affairs Bureau (Section) in all counties where mountain compatriots live has a Mountain Administration Section and a Mountain Administration Instructor, while the district office designates personnel from the Civil Affairs Section to be responsible for mountain administration.</p>
<p>(3) At the Township Level—Township public offices and village offices are organized in the same way as in the plains in the mountainous areas of each county, abolishing the past tribal society and chieftain system, and also abolishing the police-controlled agencies of the past, using autonomous administrative agencies for active management and guidance.</p>
<p>Professional Ethics: In order to expedite the promotion of mountain work in various counties, seventeen articles of service rules for mountain workers in various counties have also been formulated. The contents clearly define the distinction between the duties, ethics, and powers of the workers. Finally, it clearly points out the position and importance of mountain workers, and ensures their livelihood, and encourages them to continue serving for a long time (unless there are illegal or dereliction of duty). Within five years of employment, they must not change their minds and request a transfer, in order to give them time to show their talents. The workers themselves must not ask for leave arbitrarily without proper reasons, and must not leave their posts without permission. Even if leave is granted, it is only for three days. Beyond this, they must report to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. This shows how much the provincial authorities value and strictly control this group of workers, so that they can work hard and tirelessly to seek the welfare of mountain compatriots and promote national policy for the government.</p>
<p>Support for Public Opinion: Mountain public opinion bodies are also being established in the same way as in the plains to train their autonomy and instill in them a sense of nation and ethnicity. Mountain compatriots have now taken the citizen oath. Each village holds a village meeting, and each township elects township representatives to form a township representative council. As for the election of provincial councilors in Taiwan this time, mountain compatriots are also encouraged to compete. Therefore, not only are there as many as ten county councilors elected, but also 206 township representatives. This unprecedented initiative is an unparalleled glory for mountain compatriots.</p>
<p>Subsidized Expenses: The amount of expenses required to carry out various mountain administrative businesses is quite large, but in order to achieve the ideal requirements, the Taiwan authorities have subsidized all of the mountain administrative expenses of 39,457,800 yuan (Taiwan dollars) for each county this year from the provincial treasury, so that everything can proceed according to plan.</p>
<p>Correcting Misunderstandings: Mountain people have always liked firearms because of their hunting activities. Although there is a lot of information from various sources, there are no signs of hoarding military fire and out-of-bounds attempts based on the current popular sentiment and facts. At the same time, the authorities have repeatedly ordered the relevant county governments to continue to pay close attention to prevent accidents. The county magistrates are very clear about the history and habits of the mountain people, so they can handle mountain facilities carefully. Because there are many misunderstandings about this point, the statements of the relevant responsible persons to the reporter are mentioned here.</p>
<p>Mutual Exchange: In order to achieve the first step of household registration in the plains and towns, mountain compatriots have household registration in mountain villages, and compatriots in the plains have the first and second steps to achieve no distinction between mountain and plain in administrative autonomy, no boundaries between mountain and plain in culture and economy, that is, no mountain and plain colors in language habits. Therefore, the authorities are still planning to gradually relocate and settle people, select reclamation areas, relocate the population of the plains, and live and produce together with mountain compatriots. However, for the time being, people in the plains are still restricted from entering the mountains to prevent cunning people from taking the opportunity to deceive the kind mountain people.</p>
<p>Final Goal: The biggest key to ethnic harmony and integration lies in "marriage," and the final goal of mountain administration in the province is to gradually promote and encourage intermarriage, break down boundaries, and assimilate invisibly. Therefore, in the future, we will also consider the actual situation and formulate reward regulations to promote intermarriage between mountain and plain compatriots, in order to form new cells of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Work Performance: Since the implementation of mountain administration, the work performance in various aspects, such as the universal establishment of national schools in various villages, the establishment of health centers in townships, the establishment of malaria prevention centers in villages, and the establishment of agricultural training centers in counties. At present, there are a total of 30 mountain township public offices, 177 village offices, 177 national schools in townships and villages, 30 township health centers, and 110 village malaria prevention centers in the province. In addition, agricultural training centers have been established in seven counties, including Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hualien, to carry out mountain work separately. In addition, guiding the organization of cooperative societies at all levels to replace transactions that deprive mountain compatriots of their interests, and building roads and bridges to facilitate mountain transportation, are all important policies that are being actively handled. They have all been gradually realized, and two mountain middle schools in Taipei and Kaohsiung counties are also actively preparing.</p>
<p>The promotion of mountain administration is going smoothly at present. In the near future, we will be able to see them standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of the plains and working together to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Case in Northeastern Anhui: Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu on the 21st</h3>
<p>— Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>The few counties in northeastern Anhui Province have always seemed to be places that are not very noticed. Now, in this vast wilderness, there is war, floods, famine, and pestilence constantly changing, and it seems like a heartbreaking picture.</p>
<p>It is said that the few counties in northeastern Anhui Province refer to the areas occupied and disturbed by the communist army in recent years. It is best to take Hongze Lake as the center point first; the so-called northeastern Anhui refers to the counties of Xuyi, Tianchang, Wuhe, Sixian, and Lingbi on the outer periphery of the lake. Readers should not underestimate these remote small counties. Xuyi was originally a mountain city where Sun Xin, the grandson of King Huai of Chu—Emperor Yi, established his capital, and Lingbi was the site of Gaixia, where Xiang Yu, the Overlord of Western Chu, was encircled and annihilated by Emperor Gaozu of Han. There is also a burial place to commemorate in the east of the county seat.</p>
<p>The Shores of Hongze Lake Can't Bear to Talk About the Past</p>
<p>The area close to Hongze Lake has always been interwoven with ports and rivers, and covered with reeds. In the past, it was really like Luoma Lake in Ping opera, and it could be called a den of thieves. The lake is full of water chestnuts and lotus roots, and fish and shrimp breed. If it is a time of peace, the water conservancy is rich, and the products are abundant. If the residents have a way to feed themselves, why would they be willing to ambush and hide, and live the life of Liangshanpo!</p>
<p>Outside the lake, the plains are vast and boundless, and the soil is fertile. Agriculture is particularly developed in this area. There are big landlords with feudal overtones, and tenants are the landlords' serfs. In peaceful times, they lived in abundance and without worry. In some places, it is really "fields looking at each other, chickens and dogs hearing each other, and never interacting with each other until old age." In this sincere and simple rural society, it is not unusual. Now, more than eight million people in the northeastern corner of Anhui Province have been unable to withstand the oppression of the communist army, the ravages of war, the exploitation of corruption, the invasion of disasters, and the torment of pestilence. Most of them are struggling on the brink of starvation and migrating on the road of exile, living a subhuman life.</p>
<p>Innocent People Driven to Be Cannon Fodder</p>
<p>The communist army, which is entrenched in the cities, towns, and villages of Xu, Tian, Wu, Si, and Ling, is simply the devil in the world. They have a bloody rule over the people in the so-called "liberated areas," and there is no atmosphere of democracy at all. In the past year, they have killed, tied up, and fought like practical jokes, and looking for rent is like opening their hearts, making the common people like ants on a hot pot, turning around and around, unable to find a way out; unexpectedly, a thunderbolt sounded, and the war in northern Jiangsu broke out. The communist army gathered five or six thousand, and several divisions of the national army arrived. In the sultry atmosphere, the artillery fire was continuous, and the people were killed and starved to death under the sound of guns and shadows. It is really countless. The reporter's hometown was originally a small village in the border area between Jiangsu and Anhui, but unexpectedly, it was burned by the war last month. Twelve residents of the village were injured by artillery shells. The reporter's sister-in-law and nephew, mother and son, were killed by the bombing. In addition, several younger brothers and nephews were injured and went to Xuzhou for treatment.</p>
<p>Wang Yaqian, the communist county magistrate of Wuhe, first dug up the Huai Dike to flood farmland and destroy roads in order to prevent the National Army from mobilizing. As a result, the area outside Wuhe City suddenly became a swamp. The communist army in the southern township of Lingbi destroyed the Huaihe embankment in order to respond. Because the Huaihe River is a tributary of the Huai River, if the Huaihe River breaches its banks, the Huai River cannot but be affected.</p>
<p>Su County is also one of the counties in northeastern Anhui Province. The county seat is a medium-sized station on the southern line of the Jinpu Railway. After the victory, it was garrisoned by the National Army, but the communist army appeared in the surrounding villages from time to time, threatening traffic. The county magistrate, Zheng Huaidan, was also commissioned to help collect grain and force the use of resistance currency. The puppet county government was located in Suixikou. Recently, due to the National Army's suppression, in addition to attacking them and fleeing east and west, they suddenly dug up the river dikes in Quefosi, Jieshoudian, Yanqiao and other places at the junction of Su County and Yongcheng a few days ago. Among them, the Ba River was flooded, and the water was three or four feet deep on the flat ground. In addition to the cloud rain disaster, locusts harmed the people in an area of about ten kilometers in western Su County, and the sound of crying shook the wilderness, which was unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>After the Yellow River overflowed eastward, the water level of the Huai River rose sharply. Today (21st), the water level here has risen to 20.19 meters, exceeding the record of the highest flood level of 20.17 meters in 20 years. Many embankments along the Huai River have been washed away. The river area in the city of Bengbu has been flooded. The water depth on the road is at ankle level. If the Huai River continues to rise, Bengbu will be in danger of sinking. The flood prevention agencies are stepping up their efforts to block and defend. Since the surrounding counties and towns are under the disaster of natural and man-made disasters, the business here has been greatly affected, the market is depressed, and business is sluggish, completely shrouded in the shadow of depression. If this continues, industry and commerce will fall into the abyss of collapse. The Chamber of Commerce has sent representatives to Beijing to petition for industrial and commercial loans, hoping that the amount will be at least 50,000,000,000 yuan to save this crisis.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after the National Army bravely attacked, in a scene of bloody hand-to-hand combat, it successively recovered the five counties of Tian, Xu, Si, Wu, and Ling. When the communist army was about to retreat in Lingbi, it buried landmines inside and outside the city, hoping to harm our military and civilians entering the city. After the National Army entered the city, it searched and excavated more than 100 mines. Due to a moment of carelessness, one exploded inside the West Gate, killing an old woman, and one exploded outside the South Gate, injuring a child. The cruelty of the Communist Party is so great.</p>
<p>After the war in the five counties, it was truly a scene of devastation. The city area was full of rubble, and the countryside was desolate. The survivors who returned after the war had problems with food and lodging. "The fields and gardens are desolate after the war, and the flesh and blood are displaced on the road." This is a true picture of the current situation in northeastern Anhui.</p>

<h3>The Assassination of Zhang Yanmao</h3>
<p>The assassination of Zhang Yanmao, Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, in Bian (Kaifeng) has caused great concern in all quarters. The authorities are also investigating the case in separate directions to apprehend the murderers and find out the truth. According to investigations, Zhang received an anonymous threatening letter on July 5, which read: "To the recipient, we are strangers, so let's not be polite. Recently, I was ordered to assassinate you, and I have no choice. But in good conscience, if it weren't for my help, even ten of you would have been shot. I hope you will find a way to leave Bian, and I have ordered three to five people to carefully identify your Dongfu. It would be best if you could take a car and avoid taking the old route. We will talk again when we meet in the future. Yours truly, scribbling on paper." After receiving the letter, his comrades all advised him to be careful. However, Zhang, who had dedicated himself to the revolution and traveled around for decades, spending his days in life-and-death situations, remained unmoved. Later, after the Kunming Li Wen case occurred one after another, friends and colleagues urged him even more earnestly, pointing out that the current political situation was very different from the past, and that ambitious people were trying to create chaos, stir up trouble, and shake society to increase the difficulties of the central government. Moreover, the situation in central Henan was particularly bad, and since you (referring to Zhang) came to the province, those who liked to create chaos had their shackles difficult to break free from, and their accumulated hatred might lead them to commit such a heinous act. They repeatedly advised him to take care of himself. Zhang replied that peaceful negotiations were what people across the country desired, and looking around internally and externally, there were shocks and dangers, and peaceful unity should already be the common pursuit of enlightened and knowledgeable people. Even if ambitious people harbored different ambitions, they would probably not resort to such measures. Moreover, revolutionary party members like them should be at the forefront of the people, and at this difficult time, if they could not correct the chaos and return to righteousness, but instead escaped danger and avoided hardship, living in concealment, even they would feel ashamed. If something unexpected happened, even if they died in their posts, they would have no regrets. How could they seek to avoid it? Although his comrades felt it was dangerous, they could not change his mind. When Zhou Enlai arrived in Bian to inspect the Yellow River blockage project, Zhang's belief in the future of peace became even stronger, and he paid even less attention to his own safety. However, Zhou left Bian on the 21st, and Zhang was killed on the morning of the 23rd. All parties are extremely saddened and angered by this. Zhang's life was upright and heroic, and he was indeed deeply envied by those who opposed the central government and harbored political ambitions. Here is a brief outline to provide reference for those concerned about this case.</p>
<p>Zhang's style name was Zhiqing, and he was from Fanshi, Henan. He was born seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. He lost his mother at the age of three and was diligent and self-motivated from a young age, with a unique and profound spirit, harboring great ambitions. At the age of nineteen, he graduated from the Fourth Normal School of Henan Province and taught at the Fanshi County Higher Primary School. At that time, the domestic revolutionary atmosphere was strong, and Zhang was influenced by political ideas and devoted himself to the revolution and nation-building. He particularly admired Dr. Sun Yat-sen's political ideas and joined the Kuomintang in the sixteenth year. When the Northern Expeditionary Army had just arrived in Wuhan, he sneaked into central Henan to secretly organize and train the people, and instigated them to respond. For a time, all localities followed suit. The military operations on the Pinghan Railway were thus able to advance rapidly. In the seventeenth year, he entered the Central Party Affairs School and worked hard to explore the principles of the revolution. When the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced to Shandong Province, the central government, in order to strengthen propaganda, sent Zhang to accompany the Ninth Army north, where he was exclusively responsible for propaganda work. When the army reached Jinan, the May 3rd Massacre occurred. Due to the diplomatic environment, he returned to Nanjing with the army to complete his studies at the Party School. At that time, in the Kaifeng local party affairs election, Zhang was elected as a standing committee member and engaged in party training work, devoting all his efforts and achieving great results. Later, feeling that various opinions were flying around and political theories were in turmoil, and that young people lacked leadership in their thinking, he transferred to the education sector of Henan Province. He successively taught at the Provincial No. 1 Middle School, the Provincial No. 1 Normal School, and Jingquan Middle School, and concurrently managed training. As a result, the youth of central China were deeply influenced by the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Between the twenty-first and twenty-second years, the Japanese invasion of Chahar and Suiyuan was very urgent. Zhang went north to serve as the chief editor of the Northwest Public Opinion, engaging in cultural resistance against the enemy, with the goal of promoting national culture and awakening national consciousness. His righteous arguments were promoted, and the enemy was wary of him. In the twenty-fourth year, the Chahar Provincial Party Affairs Department was forced to withdraw, so he returned to the Central Party Headquarters, serving for ten years, taking on difficult and dangerous tasks, and making brilliant achievements. In the winter of the thirty-third year, the enemy forces in North China were still strong, and the war in the Central Plains suffered repeated setbacks. Zhang silently observed the crux of the problem, which was that the local people were not organized and trained well enough. Therefore, he resolutely requested to be transferred to local service, and in March of the thirty-fourth year, he took office as the Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters. After taking office, he made plans and handled affairs in an orderly manner, and all abandoned tasks were resumed. There was also a harmonious and seamless relationship between comrades, reversing the chaotic situation of the past. As a result, the strength of the people rose, and the military and the people coordinated, and the power of resistance against the enemy in the Central Plains grew stronger and more vigorous day by day.</p>
<p>Since the victory, the military demobilization has been orderly, all based on the foundation laid by Zhang's deep organization and training of the people. The hatred of the enemy has become even more deeply ingrained. For more than a year, they have been thinking of taking revenge, and anonymous threatening letters have been sent more than once, but Zhang has ignored them all. However, the most recent letter has indeed succeeded in its treacherous scheme. Zhang devoted his entire life to struggle, was loyal to the party and loved the country, and his death was heavier than Mount Tai, so he had no regrets. However, Zhang was cut down in his prime, which is a loss to the country. Zhang did not engage in production during his lifetime. He is survived by his wife, Ms. Hou Songling, and his children, Zhenlong, Zhenlei, and Guan, who are orphans and helpless. His desolate aftermath is truly heartbreaking and evokes sympathy!

<h3>The "Executive Relief Administration" in Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Pingzhai</p>
<p>(Continued from page 8)</p>
<p>Everyone makes "expedient" arrangements and "gets the moon first near the water tower." As a result, disaster victims in remote inland provinces such as Hunan, Henan, and Guangxi can only starve and wait forever. If transportation cannot be resolved, they will have even more opportunities to "wait."</p>
<p>More than two hundred foreign staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China have pointed out that our country has a tendency to discriminate politically in its relief efforts. However, the smooth negotiations between the Executive Relief Administration and Zhou Enlai can prove that this accusation is clearly quite far from the truth. However, can these unpleasant things be prevented from happening again in the future? I think that every person who cares about the Executive Relief Administration and UNRRA probably wouldn't dare to say definitively, "There will be no more problems from now on."</p>
<p>Humans are political animals, and no one can avoid having some biases. There are as many as twenty-two different nationalities among the staff of the UNRRA office in China. Some of them are scholars, experts, soldiers, and many are "old Shanghai" and "China hands" from the Shanghai Municipal Council during the concession era. People have different backgrounds, so their thoughts will naturally be different. The friction between Jews and non-Jews is quite intense, and the "sectionalism" is indeed deep-seated. The fact that the relationship between Orme-Sands and Reiss cannot be harmonious is also well-known. This matter is probably not unrelated to La Guardia's rage. As a result, a shipping ban was imposed on China, which "harmed" the innocent "fish in the pond." It can be seen that under the current situation, it is impossible for the "guest ministers" to "separate themselves from politics," and it does not seem likely that they will achieve "one heart and one mind." If Zhou Enlai's request to send people to participate in all departments of the Executive Relief Administration is actually realized, then the political atmosphere inside the "Executive Relief Administration" will probably be the most intense among all agencies in China.</p>
<p>"The Executive Relief Administration is a sinking ship, but we must do it well." A senior official in the Executive Relief Administration told me this.</p>
<p>In light of the current situation, it is impossible not to feel the greatest concern for the Executive Relief Administration. Whether this "ship" will "sink" is still uncertain, but time is too short, and there are indeed too many shocking waves!</p>
<p>The people in charge are all first-class talents. Mr. Jiang Tingfu not only has foresight but also has the courage to negotiate with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the best of his ability. Mr. Liu Hongsheng, who is responsible for implementation, is also a "veteran" who has experienced various storms in various businesses, and he does things without delay. The general cadres can also be said to be above average, with several very capable and energetic talents.</p>
<p>The plans are also quite complete and are quite practical.</p>
<p>If the Executive Relief Administration fails, the reasons for this failure are worth our deep consideration. When we discuss the Executive Relief Administration, we certainly cannot separate it from China's politics. If politics does not get on track, but we insist that the Executive Relief Administration succeed alone, this is like carving a boat to find a bird, and there is little hope of success. The nature of the work of the Executive Relief Administration requires the closest cooperation with various ministries and commissions. Take transportation as an example. The current difficulties in the transportation of materials are mostly due to political reasons, but there are many cases where transportation has not been smooth, but not because someone is sabotaging it. For example, why have the Jinggui National Highway and the Yuehan Railway not been properly repaired even after a year of victory? In terms of finance, the Executive Yuan has not given the Executive Relief Administration much help. The four hundred and thirty-two billion yuan of post-war relief funds allocated by the government is a substantial amount, but although this budget was created by the Executive Relief Administration, the Executive Yuan has already allocated this money to the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, and other ministries and commissions. As a result, the agency that created the budget has not received a single penny! Recently, although they have spent a great deal of effort to obtain 80 billion, how many percent of the original budget does this 80 billion account for? Speaking of selling supplies, the Executive Relief Administration had agreed with the Executive Yuan on how much to sell before determining the amount of relief to request. However, when selling, the Executive Yuan often borrowed money on its own and sold the same supplies on the market. As a result, either the goods were oversupplied and no one cared about them, or the Executive Relief Administration had to wait for the Executive Yuan to finish selling before selling its own. Even so, the sale of supplies has played a very large and decisive role in curbing inflation. However, it is really difficult for the Executive Relief Administration to exert the highest degree of efficiency under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Speaking of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which supplies the materials, it is certainly very commendable that these forty-odd friendly countries are willing to embrace the drowning person's heart and help our country, but there are still situations where they "promise verbally but do not deliver practically." The things that they promised to give you often only amount to thirty or fifty percent, and sometimes they suddenly stop for two or three months before coming again. Sometimes they send things that you don't need, but they don't have what you need most urgently. China's post-war relief has very detailed and complete plans, but their relief does not match these plans. Large machines that are completely unsuitable for China are piled up in warehouses in Shanghai, and as a result, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration issued an order to stop shipping materials, saying that the warehouses were being cleared too slowly!</p>
<p>Recently, the flames of war have risen again in the country, and staff members of the Henan branch of the Executive Relief Administration have been killed or injured, making it even more difficult to advance the work. In fact, the need for post-war relief is even more urgent. Time waits for no one. How many more months will it take to get the materials? A very great ideal of President Roosevelt seems unlikely to be realized.</p>

<h3>Answers to Readers: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Boils and Scars</p>
<p>Agricultural Rong asks: (1) What medicine can remove the scars of boils on the face? (2) Can white precipitate ointment remove boil scars? (3) What method can be used to make yellowish-brown skin whiter?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] (1) You can try Fibrolysin injections. (2) White precipitate ointment is ineffective. (3) There is no medicine that can make yellowish-brown skin whiter.</p>
<p>(2) Facial Milia</p>
<p>Mao Yufu asks: Three years ago, a small milium, about the size of a soybean, grew on my left cheek. It was similar in color to my skin and didn't cause any pain or itching, so I ignored it. Starting this year, it suddenly increased to thirty or forty particles, each about the size of a grain of rice, all flat and not pointed, about three sheets of paper thicker than the skin. Repeated treatments have been ineffective. Please advise on a radical cure.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] This is milium. It is advisable to use Trichioracetic acid or Silver Nitrate to corrode it.</p>
<p>(3) Bad Breath and Constipation</p>
<p>Yao Huilie asks: I have many red spots on my tongue, and my mouth often feels strange. My tongue coating is blood red, and it recedes slightly when I am hungry. My appetite is sometimes good and sometimes bad, and my facial muscles are getting thinner day by day. My bowel movements are not smooth, and I cannot fall back to sleep after waking up at night. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] You must first examine your stool to determine the treatment method.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Looking for Documents: I took streetcar No. 17 at 3 PM on August 18th, and due to carelessness, I lost a paper package on the streetcar. The package contained a diploma from the Zhejiang Private Prison School, as well as five letters of appointment from the Xuzhou Army Prison and the Jiangxi and Anhui Higher Courts. These documents are useless to others, but they are quite troublesome for me. If anyone finds them, please send them to No. 6 Jingde Lane, Tangzhan Road, and there will be a reward, or call 41901, and I will personally come to your residence to receive them. Xiong Suan</p>
<p>Claiming Lost Items: Yesterday, I returned to Shanghai from Qingning Temple in Pudong on the last city ferry. I saw a young man resembling a soldier carrying many pieces of luggage. He disembarked at Xiandu Wharf. Because there were many people crowded on the ferry and many passengers were getting off the boat on the shore, this person lost a piece of luggage. When the boat returned to the Shanghai port, I handed it over to the military police at the waterfront hotel for safekeeping, waiting to be claimed after it was reported in the newspaper. If the loser sees the report, please go to the military police detachment there to inquire. Fei Zhiye respectfully</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Lingering Summer</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>The Beginning of Autumn has passed for several days, and although the summer heat has not yet dissipated, Shanghai's first summer after the victory has finally come to an end. Last summer, the people of Shanghai were listening to the piercing air raid sirens with infinite excitement and tension. When the heavy engine sound came, they quietly listened to the direction of the bombing and counted the number of bombs. Sometimes the glass windows were shattered by the blast of the bombs, and one or two pieces of shrapnel jumped into the bedroom. However, there was no resentment in everyone's hearts. On the contrary, everyone was looking forward to the counterattack that was about to come!</p>
<p>After the first Allied aircraft bombed the Shanghai suburban airport, the enemy puppet newspapers published small special editions about a foot square, which were plastered all over the telephone poles. The enemy's intention may have been to arouse the resentment of the Shanghai people, but what many Chinese people who remained in Shanghai said to this special edition was, "As long as we win, I don't mind being bombed to death!"</p>
<p>Victory has been achieved. The Gujiazhai Park, which was a restricted area last year, is packed with tourists this year. Hongkou—a place where no one dared to go last year—has many people enjoying a cool moment in the swimming pool this year. Shanghai is gradually awakening.</p>
<p>The summer of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) may still have a few things that are particularly worth remembering: The first is that there were heavy rainstorms this summer, and the roads became a country of lakes. The second is that Shanghai held a "Miss" and "Queen" competition this summer to raise money for disaster relief. I hope the roads will be repaired soon and there will be no more floods in the future. I hope the "ticket money" for electing Miss and Queen will soon be in the hands of the refugees and not just circulating in the hands of the handlers!</p>
<h3>"Garden Parties" were also particularly popular this summer.</h3>
<h3>Heavy rainstorms this summer turned the roads into a country of lakes.</h3>
<h3>A "Miss" and "Queen" competition was held for the refugees in northern Jiangsu.</h3>
<h3>Relaxing in the swimming pool</h3>
<h3>Fuxing Park—formerly Gujiazhai Park—is packed with tourists</h3>
<h3>Hongkou swimming pool is crowded with people this summer.</h3>
<h3>Young ladies are enjoying a happy summer in the park.</h3>
<h3>Summer camps were also held in several places in Shanghai, and they are having an exciting time living in paradise.</h3>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Groans Under the Shuttles (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Lian E</p>
<p>The weather in early autumn was extraordinarily stuffy, especially at noon, which was even more unbearable! Looking up at the sky, it was covered with dense, dark clouds, and everyone knew that a sudden rain would fall immediately.</p>
<p>The "Echo" chime for the twelve o'clock lunch break had just sounded. The cement chimney of the ×× cloth factory, standing tall on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, was emitting thick smoke, curling upwards towards the dark clouds in the sky, rising in clumps, rising, and then blending into the cloud layer.</p>
<p>A dozen female workers hurried out of the factory, all saying in unison, "Ah! What to do? I didn't bring my overshoes and umbrella!" As they spoke, they ran together into the dining hall.</p>
<p>At this time, the dining hall was already crowded, and everyone was scrambling to get to the hot water tap to make rice porridge. The hot water taps were really unreliable. Although there were more than a dozen in a row, the water coming out of only the first two or three taps was satisfactory. The rest were pitifully small, and the last two were practically like a sick woman's breast milk, impossible to squeeze out.</p>
<p>Xiuying was a new worker who had just started, so she had to let the older workers go first in everything, but she was really anxious in her heart: she couldn't weave less cloth today. The stern face of the foreman, Sister Wang, appeared before her eyes again. She really resented that the yarn had broken so many times in the past two days. Even worse, she kept encountering "flying shuttles," and calling the mechanic to fix them took up even more time. Now she saw that her companions had already eaten and gone into the factory, while her rice porridge was not even made. Anxious, she simply didn't wait. She ate some cold rice haphazardly and walked towards the factory.</p>
<p>The rain did fall heavily as everyone had expected, and it was getting heavier and heavier. It hadn't stopped by five o'clock, and every worker was worried about the road home. Only Xiuying was worried that she had woven even less cloth than yesterday. How would she explain it to the foreman later? And the mechanic kept coming around to offer his services, talking nonsense, which was really annoying!</p>
<p>The mechanic was a local tyrant in the factory, and no one dared to offend him. Even Sister Wang had to give him some respect, and the "little rice buckets" (Note 1) didn't dare to provoke him either.</p>
<p>Xiuying had no choice but to humor him. When he learned that Xiuying was afraid of being fired by the female foreman for weaving too little cloth, he assured Xiuying that he could speak to Sister Wang for her.</p>
<p>In the end, Xiuying managed to have a smooth week thanks to the mechanic's intercession.</p>
<p>Mechanical civilization, on the one hand, has brought material enjoyment to people, but on the other hand, it has brought more misfortune to people. However, those as unfortunate as Xiuying, after working a week of day shifts, were now about to work night shifts.</p>
<p>Working the night shift was also a full twelve hours of work. Except for ten minutes or so for eating at midnight, the female workers tending the machines (Note 2) were not allowed to be lazy for even a minute.</p>
<p>Xiuying was naturally no exception.</p>
<p>The misting machine sprayed water mist non-stop, and the factory was full of man-made fog. The grating noise of over two hundred looms was about to shatter people's eardrums. Xiuying focused all her attention on watching the shuttle moving back and forth in the warp threads.</p>
<p>Now, because of her relationship with the mechanic, Sister Wang had assigned her two looms. It was a great honor for a new worker whose skills were not yet fully proficient to be assigned to manage two looms at the same time. Because their wages were calculated based on the amount of cloth woven, managing two looms meant they could weave more cloth, of course, but it also meant they would be much busier than managing one loom.</p>
<p>Factory owners were most concerned about the productivity of the machines, so even though the female workers were "living on their own," if the amount they wove did not meet the standard, they would still be interfered with - fines, cancellation of bonuses, dismissal... were all stipulated in the factory regulations.</p>
<p>Although Xiuying was very happy to be managing two looms, she was also very scared. She thought that after she received her wages, she could buy a bottle of cod liver oil for her father. For several years, her father had been teaching in a private middle school, which was really too strenuous and didn't earn much money.</p>
<p>All-day labor and all-night coughing had left him as thin as a rail, and his lung disease was about to enter the third stage. But for the sake of livelihood, he was still working hard.</p>
<p>Although her mother was only in her forties, she was as worn out as an old woman in her sixties. Her body was too weak to work for long periods, but she forced herself not to rest all day long. In fact, she really couldn't afford to rest!</p>
<p>Her younger brother was studying in junior high school, and he and her father had to come home for meals. Her younger sister was too young to help, and her mother had to take care of everything.</p>
<p>But when she thought about the time wasted frequently stopping to join broken threads, she couldn't help but worry.</p>
<p>Evil seems to be inseparable from the darkness, and many evils in the city occur in the night. Even in another corner of the city, evil is growing.</p>
<p>Just as Xiuying was joining a thread, the mechanic quietly slipped behind her and whispered to her:</p>
<p>"Come to my house tomorrow at three o'clock!"</p>
<p>"No, my mom doesn't allow me to go out."</p>
<p>"Just say the factory has a meeting tomorrow."</p>
<p>"No, I want to sleep!"</p>
<p>"There's a bed in my house too!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The next night, Xiuying was still weaving cloth, but her heart was still uneasy. The mechanic's fierce gaze kept flashing before her eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the loom stopped. Xiuying hurriedly tried to turn on the switch, but no matter how she turned it, it didn't work. She knew there was something wrong and had to find the mechanic to fix it. The mechanic came, first removing the machine wheel and slowly wiping it with a cloth... After half an hour, Xiuying really couldn't wait any longer. She asked the mechanic how long it would take to fix it, and the mechanic replied:</p>
<p>"Can you come out at twelve o'clock tomorrow? I can fix it right away, otherwise, I'm afraid it won't be fixed tonight!"</p>
<p>"Um!"</p>
<p>"Shall we go to the Great World tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Mechanical life is as repetitive as can be. Every day, joining threads, removing cloth, putting on yarn... every day it's always the same thing. Xiuying had gotten used to these things. Tonight, because she had spent half the day playing with the mechanic, she couldn't hold on any longer by two o'clock in the middle of the night. Her eyes just wanted to close, and she yawned incessantly.</p>
<p>The mechanic also knew that Xiuying couldn't hold on. Now, seeing her sleepy and drowsy, he ran over to her and said:</p>
<p>"Go to the locker room and get some sleep! I can borrow some cloth from other female workers for you tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>Xiuying really couldn't resist the invasion of sleep, so she nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The locker room was where the female workers changed clothes when they came to work and left work. Except when it was particularly lively during "shift changes," it was always locked the rest of the time. The key was kept by the foreman, and no one else could enter it casually.</p>
<p>Now, because of the mechanic's connection, Xiuying was able to openly "skim oil" (Note 3).</p>
<p>When Xiuying woke up bleary-eyed, she felt a surge of heat coursing through her body. She wanted to struggle, but she didn't have the strength. She could only let herself be trampled and slaughtered until he was satisfied.</p>
<p>She wanted to cry out, but she didn't dare. She thought her life was over. Thinking of this, she cried, very, very softly. She was afraid of being laughed at if she was heard, so after sobbing for a while, she wiped away her tears, straightened her hair, and walked out of the locker room. In the alley between the machines, she met Sister Wang, and her face flushed as she lowered her head and quickly walked to her machine. Although she had avoided Sister Wang's gaze, she could see very clearly the pair of eyes that clearly contained jealousy and helplessness. So she understood even more in her heart, but what use was there in understanding?</p>
<p>Half a month later, the weather was still very stuffy. Xiuying was still very busy weaving cloth. The grating noise of the machines continued unchanged, and the misting machine was still spraying rain-like mist. Everything seemed very calm and very regular.</p>
<p>Heaven seemed to specialize in bullying the easy targets. In this calm and regular atmosphere, a commotion suddenly arose. Everyone stopped their machines and looked towards Xiuying's loom. They saw Xiuying's face covered in blood, and she had fainted on the ground. It turned out that a shuttle had flown off one of the looms next to Xiuying. This shuttle, with its sharp iron tips at both ends, had been shot out by the "picker stick" (Note 4), and it had hit Xiuying right in the temple, knocking her unconscious in pain.</p>
<p>When Xiuying woke up, she was already lying in the ×× Labor Hospital. The hospital was quiet, with no miscellaneous sounds, but Xiuying's mind was still filled with the annoying sound of the machines!</p>
<p>She only felt that her head was about to be shattered by the sound, so she experienced bursts of excruciating pain. So she groaned in pain.</p>
<p>But the groans under the shuttles are weak. Only those with the same fate as Xiuying can hear such weak groans clearly. So now Xiuying's painful groans can only be experienced quietly by herself.</p>
<p>Note 1: Little rice buckets - A common term used behind the backs of young staff in textile factories.</p>
<p>Note 2: Tending machines - The general term for looms, tending looms refers to managing looms.</p>
<p>Note 3: Skim oil - Stealing sleep while working the night shift is called skimming oil.</p>
<p>Note 4: Picker stick - A wooden stick made of sandalwood, with a hard leather piece on top, used to strike the shuttle. There are two on each loom, left and right.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Tired...? It's not like you're a city girl." He felt slightly insulted after all. "Even if you add three more like this, wouldn't you still have to walk, Uncle?" His voice still had the shrillness of a child, but his demeanor was so old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Regarding food, no matter what he ate, refined or coarse, and regardless of the time, as long as he was given a little, he welcomed it all and ate quite a lot. Although he was skinny for a twelve or thirteen-year-old, he was five feet two or three inches tall, only an inch or two shorter than me. According to common saying, he was in his "growth spurt," so he couldn't gain weight, but he could eat.</p>
<p>After a while, after making some miscellaneous arrangements over the phone, I put on my official handgun and went to the front room. Little Tiger was still eating. As soon as he saw me enter the room, knowing that it was time to leave, he left his seat and said goodbye to the comrades in the room, calling them Uncle and Big Brother. He also grabbed a small cloth bag on the table. It looked like a bag of snacks that the Uncles and Big Brothers had prepared for him.</p>
<p>"Which road did you come from just now?" As soon as we left the courtyard, I wanted to know some information about the situation on the road. At this time, there was a cannon blast roughly every two or three minutes in the east and northeast, mixed with some heavy machine-gun fire. The northwest was relatively calm, but there was also gunfire. These were all precautionary postures, not formal engagements.</p>
<p>"Come this way," he pointed to the northwest corner, "I took several detours, taking small paths." His steps were still so light.</p>
<p>I hadn't taken this road in the northwest corner. I heard that it would cross Lugou Bridge, skirt around several small mountains, pass through Tiancun, Bali Village, and enter the city through Xizhimen or Guang'anmen. Even without detours, it would be seventy or eighty li.</p>
<p>"Uncle, would you like to see some excitement?" Little Tiger slowed down and turned his head to look at me.</p>
<p>"Good boy, don't we have important business today?... "I knew what his little mind was up to, "There will be plenty of opportunities to see excitement later."</p>
<p>"Then, we have to cross this small ridge, take the small path over there, and head to Xibianmen--but you won't see a single ghost."</p>
<p>"Okay, as long as we get close, fast, and have no trouble, it's even better if we don't see a ghost..." Seeing that he had politely started to argue, I had no choice but to encourage him with a sentence, "Look, when we have free time one day, can't you and I go find the Japanese devils and make some trouble?"</p>
<p>He smiled happily. "Uncle, you really 'have guts.'... Grandpa, the grandpa in the village, also really has guts. In less than ten days and a half, he's going to fight a guerrilla battle. You know, the Japanese devils eat a lot of stuff." He raised the bag of snacks in his hand and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. "They don't eat this stuff. They eat bread, canned beef, rice balls... We have to loot a big pile of it every time, and also guns, rifles, and stuff."</p>
<p>Hearing him mention the mountain village, I was reminded of this child's legendary story:</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Tiger, thirteen... Aunt Ji calculated for me, saying it can only be counted as twelve years old, I'm also not sure." Aunt Ji was Ji Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"I heard that you're pretty good at what you practice...?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing... Bagua sparring, hitting the post, Yang Palm, Dharma Gong, grappling hands, and I haven't practiced Qigong well yet."</p>
<p>"How many years have you been practicing?"</p>
<p>"Fourteen years, Uncle."</p>
<p>"How can that be?" Even if you count thirteen years old, you can't have practiced for fourteen years.</p>
<p>"How is that?" He didn't understand what I meant, tilting his head, his big round eyes blank.</p>
<p>"Ten years or four years...? It can't be fourteen years, right."</p>
<p>"My grandpa said so; that is, Master Ma, who taught me to practice Kung Fu--he's seventy or eighty years old this year."</p>
<h3>Snippets on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Stedi</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Poetry is the most beautiful rhythm of emotion, the sublimation of language, and the best artistic technique of written expression.</p>
<p>The expression of emotion is not limited to writing and language; musicians weave their hearts into musical scores, allowing nerves to pulsate among soaring musical notes. Painters mix life into oil paints, capture fleeting moments, and preserve elusive light for eternity. Art includes literature, literature is the art of language, and poetry is the language of literature. Thus, poetry is the same as all art, possessing the conditions that art must possess, processed through special artistic methods, and expressed.</p>
<p>Poetry must be "beautiful." Beauty is not strangeness, dazzling clouds only give people momentary dazzle. Beauty is not ornate, magnificent palaces only lock up a house of dullness. The value of "beauty" lies in eternity, and it must maintain immortal brilliance. The meaning of "beauty" focuses on essence, not merely belonging to the realm of form. "Beauty" must be "true." The formation of mirages is merely a reflection of real things. "Truth" is built on "reality." The "truth" of poetry is to reflect the face of reality through the poet's subjective image onto the truth of the poem. Therefore, "true" poetry must have the backbone of life. "Beauty" must be "good." The progress of history is the victory of the struggle between "good" and "evil." The ideal of beauty is arranged in front, and people must pursue it through the path of suffering. "Good" indicates the inevitable direction. Therefore, "good" poetry must step to the same rhythm as the progress of history. The "beauty" of poetry is not only the beauty of words, rhythm, language, and form, but also includes the beauty of "truth" and "goodness" in essence. Poetry should be the cry of the awakened soul of a prophet, full of lofty and great hope, showing the paradise of human life ideals. Poetry must sing of pain, making a powerful appeal for those oppressed under opposing forces and social environments. Poetry must sing of battle, revealing the progress and liberation of human history. "Beauty" cannot be without conditions, and "beauty" cannot be without a price. I do not object to pure natural beauty, but in the path of human life, "beauty" is the ultimate goal of struggle. Poets must use awakened souls and sublime emotions to blend reality and create a harmonious melody of "beauty."</p>
<p>Poetry is the most refined image language in literature. A piece of rough pig iron, after a thousand forges and a thousand hammerings, can achieve tough steel. Language is ore, which must be washed in rapids. A thousand loads of iron sand cannot wash out several loads of pure sand. To create a true sculpture of real emotions and desires, one must pick the most refined language, refine and discard the dross, preserve all the essence, rich life emotions, powerful musical rhythms, magnificent painting colors, and strong ideological concepts. The composition of dross is complex, but everything is useless. The quality of essence is subtle, but it encompasses all value. The refinement of poetry must contain infinite meaning.</p>
<p>Poetry is not painting, and painting is not poetry. The ancients had a saying, "There is painting in poetry, and there is poetry in painting." The former illustrates the expressive beauty of poetry, and the latter illustrates the emotional beauty of painting. After all, poetry and painting have significant differences due to the different tools of expression. Poetry is not prose, and prose is not poetry. The form and structure of poetry often carry a strong prosaic quality. The description and imagery of prose also have a rich poetic rhythm. Poetry and prose cannot be clearly demarcated due to their mutual tools. Poetry is not music, and music is not poetry, but poetry must be a sonata played by reality's fingers plucking the strings of the soul; it contains the harmony of sounds, the rhythm of emotions, the melody of meanings, and the tone of lyricism. The expression of art has an unbounded commonality, and poetry, in the department of language art—literature, is relatively more direct and lifelike language.</p>
<h3>Reading "The Tempest"</h3>
<p>— By George Gissing, Translated by Ma Yufeng</p>
<p>Today I read "The Tempest," perhaps my most beloved play. Because I consider myself to already understand it well, I usually only skim through it without truly reading it. But this is often the case with Shakespeare; if I read him again, I feel my knowledge is incomplete, more so than I imagined. This will be the case no matter how long one lives. It will always be so as long as one has the strength to turn the pages and the mood to read it.</p>
<p>I like to believe this was the poet's last work, written in his home in Stratford, as he walked daily in the fields that taught him to love the English countryside in his youth. This is the ripe fruit born of the highest imagination, a perfect masterpiece in the hands of a master. Because Shakespeare's skillful and free use of language surpasses all the achievements of other great men, what pleasure can compare to it for those who dedicate their lives to the study of English? I can imagine that he felt this power particularly in "The Tempest," as inimitable and appropriate words, and phrases of unparalleled rhythm, whispered to him from the mouth of his guardian spirit Ariel (Translator's Note: This is the spirit in the play). He wrote, smiling to himself. His language seems to play, amusing itself by discovering new methods. People of every class, from emperors to beggars, and people of every mental state, speak through his mouth. He has told the legends of fairyland, and now he creates something that is neither human nor spirit, but something between beast and man, endowing it with language for its purpose. How those languages contain the fragrance of the fertile wetlands and the life of creatures that cannot rise to the surface! We don't think about it enough. Because our appreciation is lacking, we limit our amazement. Although miracles unfold before us, we hardly notice them. Like other mysteries of nature, our hearts have become accustomed.</p>
<p>"The Tempest" contains the most sublime meditative sentences in all of drama, sentences that are the expression of Shakespeare's final worldview, articles that cannot be omitted by those who wish to summarize philosophical teachings. It also contains his most beautiful lyric poems, his most tender love words, and a vision of fairyland that surpasses even the highest beauty of "A Midsummer Night's Dream"—I cannot help but think this. Like Prospero's farewell to "hills, brooks, calm lakes, and elves of the shady groves," these are also miracles. These sentences are read a hundred times without becoming tiresome. Every time you read them, they are always fresh, as if just created from the poet's mind. Because it is a seamless work, there is no feeling of boredom from discovering flaws. It is never possible to fully absorb its advantages, and then feel a lack of stimulation when flipping through it next time.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons I find it joyful to be born in England, the first should be that I read Shakespeare in the language of my ancestors. If I imagine that I cannot know him directly, only hear him speak from afar, only use a language learned through diligent intellect to come into contact with his vibrant soul, a coldness of disappointment and a feeling of desolate loss would befall me. I often think I can read Homer, and in fact, if there is anyone who likes him, it is me. But can I immediately dream that Homer will convey all his joy to me? And is his language the same to me as it was to people strolling by the sea in the glorious age of Greece? I know that, passing through the great river of time, what I get is only a weak, broken echo. And I know that this is a glorious sight of the ancient world, and it is even weaker if it is not mixed with the memories of youth. Let every country have its poet and find joy, because the poet is the country, is all the country's greatness and beauty, is the inalienable heritage of all people's birthplaces. Closing the book, I am dominated by love and admiration. Is it my whole heart that is poured out to this great magician? Or has he placed his spell on this island nation? I do not know. I cannot examine these two things separately. Awakened by the "voice of voices" (Translator's Note: A line from Shakespeare's poetry), in love and admiration, Shakespeare and England have become one.</p>

<h3>Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Central Bank has allocated 13,000 gold bars in four days, which, at 2.15 million yuan per bar, amounts to 27.95 billion yuan. This is no small sum.</p>
<p>The financial authorities issued a warning early on, saying that they are tightening credit and everyone should be careful to avoid slipping and falling all over the place.</p>
<p>The Eighth is just around the corner, and it will be too late to "hang yourself" by then. I would like to remind the friends who are "somersaulting" again.</p>
<p>Minister of Food Xu Kan said:</p>
<p>This year's harvests across the country are unprecedented in the last 20 years. The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has 200,000 tons, and we have ordered another 80,000 tons. Supply exceeds demand, so how can rice prices rise?</p>
<p>The work of the reception and investigation team probably won't be finished for a while, because cases of corruption and fraud are being uncovered continuously. The weather is so hot, and the committee members are busy all day with headaches and dizziness. We really feel bad about that.</p>
<p>Could all those who have committed fraud and corruption come forward and report themselves!</p>
<p>Zhang Dinghe's concert, Dai Ailian's dance performance, the Experimental Theatre's "Spring Cold," and the China Electric's "Loyalty and Righteousness Family" are the best (music, dance, drama, film) artistic activities in Shanghai in August. Giving up one is a loss.</p>
<h3>Reservation Fees and Receipts: Strange Things at the School</h3>
<p>— Tian Feng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I found a receipt for a reservation fee in Xiaoming's schoolbag, which reminded me of the story behind this receipt.</p>
<p>Xiaoming came home three or four days before the end of the semester exam last semester and said: "The headmaster told us that the school is about to close. If you still want to come here to study next semester, you must pay a reservation fee of 1,500 yuan this semester; otherwise, your place will be cancelled." In order to keep Xiaoming's place, I gave him 1,500 yuan and told him to pay it to the headmaster. After dinner, Xiaoming took the 1,500 yuan and happily went to school. At five o'clock, Xiaoming came back hopping with his schoolbag on his back. He put down his schoolbag, rummaged around in it, and took out a small packet of paper. I thought it was a receipt for the reservation fee, but when I opened it, to my surprise, it was still two bills of legal tender worth 1,500 yuan. So I asked Xiaoming why he didn't pay the reservation fee. Without thinking, Xiaoming said spiritedly, "The class teacher told us not to pay. He said this is to be paid into the headmaster's pocket. If the headmaster gives a receipt for the reservation fee, then you can pay it. If he doesn't give a receipt, don't pay it. As a result, the headmaster said there was no receipt, so I didn't pay and brought it back."</p>
<p>I felt very strange when I heard Xiaoming's words. I thought the reservation fee was to reserve a student's place and should be deducted from the tuition fee for the next semester. Why should it be paid into the headmaster's pocket? I was truly baffled. I waited until Saturday, thinking that today was the last day for Xiaoming's school to pay the reservation fee. I gave Xiaoming another 1,500 yuan and told him to pay the reservation fee. Xiaoming took the 1,500 yuan and went, but he still didn't pay. So I asked Xiaoming if his grades were bad this semester and he would have to repeat a grade, so he didn't pay the reservation fee and wanted to go to another school? Xiaoming repeatedly said no. I was very puzzled, so on Sunday morning I went to visit Xiaoming's class teacher. This teacher is a good friend of mine, and he told me the story of the reservation fee:</p>
<p>This headmaster spends all day making money. This time, in order to fill his own pockets and please the teachers, the headmaster came up with the idea of collecting reservation fees from students in the name of "teacher appreciation money." On the one hand, he distributed some to the teachers, and on the other hand, he didn't give receipts. However, the teachers were unwilling to be used by the headmaster, so they told the students not to pay the reservation fee unless there was a receipt.</p>
<p>So that's how it is. I understand.</p>
<h3>Cold</h3>
<p>— Ye Huimin</p>
<p>Scientific Common Sense</p>
<p>"Cold"—regarded as a hazard to human life just a few years ago—is now used to save lives. During this war, ice anesthesia, commonly known as "paralysis surgery," was invented. It not only numbs but also causes no pain, requires no additional medication, and does not cause bleeding.</p>
<p>Cold air reduces the vitality of human life. When a part of the body's temperature is lowered to near freezing, the cells and bacteria inside temporarily stop activity.</p>
<p>In the past, when soldiers were wounded on the battlefield, they often used tourniquets to inject oxygen into the organ on time. Each time the tourniquet leaked a lot of blood and caused toxins to enter the body. With freezing, there is no need for the trouble of a tourniquet. Because the cells in the body are not active at that time and do not need oxygen, the soldiers can absorb the toxins and avoid pain, and they can have the hope of recovery when they enter the hospital. However, it is impossible to obtain freezing surgery on the front lines, so an electric refrigerator about the size of a radio was invented and powered by the motor of an ambulance, which is very convenient to use.</p>
<p>The freezing surgery used today was invented by Dr. Frederick M. Allen, a professor at New York Medical College. Many hopeless conditions have been saved by this surgery. As an example, an eighty-three-year-old patient had gangrene in one leg. Putting this leg in the refrigerator for an hour not only gave him a new life, but also caused no pain, nausea, or feelings of collapse.</p>
<p>Since Professor Allen invented freezing surgery, it has been able to reduce the mortality rate of diabetes or gangrene by as much as 75 percent.</p>
<p>Soon, new instruments for freezing surgery in therapeutics will be produced, and Professor Allen has also hinted that there may be a new method to replace the one currently used. Applying cold, cruel air to the ulcerated part will cause the bacteria in that part to be absorbed and shrink to a minimum, and then gradually recover.</p>
<p>Freezing also shines in the field of medical skin grafting. The U.S. Army Medical Corps is now using this method: cutting a piece of skin from a patient to repair the rotten skin—this surgery used to require anesthesia, and the old surgery was inferior.</p>
<p>Although it is too early to say that medicine has entered the ice age, it has already revealed a ray of dawn, encouraging new discoveries in this corner.</p>
<h3>After the Foreign Exchange Rate Increases</h3>
<p>— Li Guan</p>
<p>A: The exchange rate has gone up. Let's buy more American goods!</p>
<p>B: What? Isn't the purpose of increasing the exchange rate to encourage everyone to buy domestic goods?</p>
<p>A: Because domestic goods have already gone up in price, most American goods haven't risen much yet. Let's buy some more while we can.</p>
<p>B: I see. No wonder the American goods business has been even better these days.</p>
<h3>Youth Paradise</h3>
<p>— Yu Jian</p>
<p>The Lushan Summer Camp, which closed yesterday</p>
<p>Scenes from the China Youth Lushan Summer Camp</p>
<p>Lushan's popularity is certainly due to the peaceful negotiations and the coming and going of important people. However, what has formed its special prosperity is the Youth Corps' Summer Camp and the Jiangxi Province's Summer Lecture Series.</p>
<p>The Summer Lecture Series is the older brother, and the Summer Camp is the younger brother. This is a tacit understanding on both sides. However, the older brother is far behind the younger brother in every aspect. Whether in material or spiritual terms, the older brother can only shake his head and sigh in inferiority. The Summer Camp is full of young men, eating three meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup with steamed buns. They live in six-story buildings and wear khaki uniforms. What's more, there are theater-style lecture halls, palace-like libraries, and clubhouse-like Chiang Kai-shek Halls. In addition, there are several movie, Peking opera, and entertainment performances every week. Under the guidance of nearly thirty male and female physical education instructors, they play ball, swim, do calisthenics, and do whatever they want. What is even more worthy of pride is that the chairman always comes to visit several times a week, and the lecturers are at least ministers of departments and institutes. This makes the older brothers in the Summer Lecture Series, who live in small houses on Dalin Road and chew on coarse tea and light meals, sigh in envy.</p>
<p>At the end of Hedong Road is the location of the Summer Camp. In the morning, it is quiet, and only the loudspeakers in the auditorium broadcast the different tones of the lecturers. In the afternoon, the athletic field unfolds a picture of health and beauty. Male students with bare chests and female students with bare arms, not one of them is not lively and energetically moving their limbs.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the sunset is like thick rouge painted red on the horizon, don't sneak into that deep forest alone, otherwise the pairs of lovers snuggling together will surely sting your heart. You might as well turn around and sit on the stone railing of the small bridge, listening to the bursts of singing coming from afar, which will give you a feeling of infinite coolness and let you close your eyes and fall into a dream of reminiscence.</p>
<p>Summer has gone, and the Summer Camp has also closed, but no one who has stayed at the Summer Camp can forget this pleasant memory!</p>
<h3>"American Mooncakes"</h3>
<p>— Wei Qin</p>
<p>Today I walked past a confectionery store on North Sichuan Road and saw an advertisement boldly proclaiming "American Guangdong Mooncakes," which made me speechless.</p>
<p>Someone said: "This is not surprising. Since the moon is already better in America, then of course the mooncakes are also better in America. It is a pity that the American moon cannot be moved to China. Otherwise, eating American mooncakes and enjoying the American moon to make a complete scene would be great, wouldn't it? But I don't know what the word Guangdong means. I should reserve my judgment and wait for further research."</p>

<h3>The Camera and Truman</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Famous People's Anecdotes</p>
<p>Since taking office on April 12, 1944, U.S. President Truman has been photographed about 300 times a month, more than anyone in history.</p>
<p>The late President Roosevelt understood the importance of photography very well. Photos can show his personality to millions of people, enhance or weaken his position among the people, and make him a symbol in the minds of the nation. So today Truman relies especially on the lens.</p>
<p>Thus, President Truman, like a Hollywood star, always maintains the best posture in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, President Lincoln frankly said that campaign photos helped him enter the White House. Of the 120 Lincoln photos that exist today, only three can be used as national portraits.</p>
<p>Later, photographic technology improved, and the late President Roosevelt benefited a lot. However, in the 1920s, news films were not yet widely circulated to express the true personality of the president.</p>
<p>President Wilson, of the World War I era, was the first U.S. president to have his speech in theaters photographed.</p>
<p>President Hoover and President Coolidge, who preceded the late President Roosevelt, were not photogenic. They were both awkward, excited, and almost timid in front of the camera, so they could not take advantage of this opportunity. Coolidge probably took 2,100 photos during his presidency, and Hoover probably 1,500.</p>
<p>Now, President Truman understands more, and "camera reporters" often stay in the White House.</p>
<h3>Social Experience in Front of the Dentist</h3>
<p>— Zhi Wei</p>
<p>This is what I heard from a worldly friend:</p>
<p>If your tooth hurts so much that you can't sleep and you have to consult a dentist, you should first understand how your savior values you.</p>
<p>When you see a dentist and tell him you're going to trouble him, you must endure the pain you showed last night lying in bed unable to sleep, and nonchalantly say to him:</p>
<p>"Doctor, please take a look. Do I need to have this tooth pulled? If the procedure is inconvenient, I think I'll just let it go!"</p>
<p>In this way, you will save a lot of money invisibly; because the dentist's scale of valuation is based on the pain you feel; the greater the pain you express, the better the opportunity for him to rip you off.</p>
<h3>What's So Strange?</h3>
<p>— Si Shui</p>
<p>What's so strange about the tram driver not stopping at the station? He can drive and can stop; naturally he can not stop. The right to stop and start is in his hands. Why can't he use it as he pleases? May I ask: In China today, how many people do not use their rights as they please?</p>
<p>What's so strange about the tram ticket seller skimming? A friend put it well: "The one who doesn't skim when money passes through his hands is a dog!" Compared with those shocking corruptions and non-shocking corruptions (the non-shocking ones are because people don't know about them), the tram ticket seller's skimming is really negligible. And it has nothing to do with the national treasury at all. Isn't it worthy of praise?</p>
<p>What's so strange about passengers rushing to get on the bus, disregarding order? If you can't squeeze on, you can only blame God for making you so incompetent. What's the use of scolding others for not keeping order? If you really can't squeeze on, there is a secret that can be taught to you, which is: take a rickshaw! If you can't squeeze on and can't afford a rickshaw, then please close your eyes and think carefully: what are you still living for in this world?</p>
<p>Passengers who haven't boarded the bus are quite disciplined; once they get on the bus, their attitude changes completely. What's so strange about this? Do you still remember that old classmate of yours? How touching were his remarks about improving social customs in the beginning? And after he was honorably appointed as ×× Chief, do you know where those garden villas of his came from?</p>
<p>The tram company has to reduce the number of vehicles due to the assertive people. This is indeed a bit strange. "If you want to sit, I just won't let you sit!" In this way, hasn't the tram company become one of the assertive people? What's more, those assertive people don't decrease because the number of vehicles decreases. Unless they don't drive a single vehicle, they always have a car to sit in; it's just that those who could sit in several cars have squeezed into one. And what about those who are squeezed out? Naturally, they are the non-assertive people! Plant beans and get melons? Isn't that strange?</p>

<p>— Yu Gang</p>
<p>There are people who like to mow lawns in winter and sweep snow in summer.</p>
<p>Divorce is democratic bankruptcy between two people.</p>
<p>If you want to see a colorful rainbow, you must wait for the rainstorm to pass.</p>
<p>Love wears out time, and time wears out love.</p>
<p>Saying nothing is often the most expressive form of speech.</p>
<p>If you make things people need, you can make a living; if you make things people want, you can get rich.</p>
<p>The so-called salary is something that you can't live with or without.</p>
