<h3>邵力子在京表示意見　和平前途仍可樂觀　政協綜合小組下週復會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕夜長夢多之關內關外停戰談判，短期內殆難實現，若干熱望和平團結之人士，正絞盡腦汁，使用一種無可奈何之分析決，强作解人，强調「軍事調處」與「政治協商」不能混為一談。今日參政會秘書長邵力子曾公關發表此項意見，邵謂，目前祗東北大規模戰事，關內鉅有小衝突，事情並不嚴重，調處前途仍可樂觀。邵氏並謂：目前有若干報紙所載國共衝突事件消息，不無渲染過份之處，因此益增人心之不安，如過去之「鄂中衝突」及目前之「蘇北戰爭」即其一例。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕據政協秘書長雷震告本報記者，政協綜合小組會議，有隨時舉行之可能，會議之中心任務，原為討論國大代表名額，政府改組，憲草審議事項，小組會議現尚未接獲各方之新提案。又政協綜合小組會議之中共代表周恩來·董必武·李維漢，政府代表邵力子·張厲生·王世杰均已到京，民主同盟代表羅隆基，張君勱·梁漱溟，青年黨代表曾琦·陳啓天，社會賢達邵從恩·王雲五，均將於廿日前集京。王雲五就任經濟部長後，不擬出席小組會議，將另選一賢達代替，現民盟代表住所正在趕修，日內可竣工。據雷震談：綜合小組會議，本週以內已不及召開，但下週內決可舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕盛傅川主席張群，即飛京，但十六日仍未到。中共代表董必武李維漢一行已於今日下午二時由渝飛抵京，中共「解放區工聯會」委員劉寗一及隨員等五人華偕行。</p>
<p>馬帥「團結」計劃　不久有實現可能</p>
<p>〔全眾社華盛頓十五日電〕今日官方人士稱：中國恢復和平之機會，今日已較兩星期前為「光明」，眾信馬歇爾將軍使國共團結之「十八個月計劃」，其最初六個月工作幾已如期完成。此等人士認為，中國方面之來訊，雖無表示摩擦已見减輕之徵象，但若干基本而未經公布之改進業已獲得。國共在華北及東北之和平，可能不久即告實現，此等人士拒絕透露實際之收穫為何，僅稱：美國自中國方面接到之官方報告，顯示有「眞正之進展」。上述人士說明馬歇爾將軍之「十八個月計劃」謂：馬氏希望在最初六個月中實現完全停戰，此一時期目下即將終了。在第二個六個月中。馬氏擬將國共軍隊合併為一統一之軍事組織，總指揮雖由國軍將領担任，但共產黨方面亦可担任師長。在此一統一之軍隊中，國共兵力之比例，自大體上言之為五與一，至於詳細情形，胥視各地之狀况而定。在第三個六個月中，馬氏希望使中國之行政機構統一及擴大，即在最小之村落內，亦須達到此一目的。在各政治機構中，國共人員之比例，其差別程度較軍事方面尤甚，但主體仍屬於中央政府。美國官方人士認為，中國各地情形之不同，使此種具有伸縮情質之方案為可能獲得成功之唯一辦法。</p>
<h3>美在華綏靖政策　或將自食其惡果　蘇威爾論中國局勢</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約十五日電〕「密勒氏評論報」編輯鮑威爾今日致函「九月先驅論增報」稱：遠東方面來訊，顯示我國在華進行之綏靖計劃不惟失敗，日有自食其惡果之可能。渠指出，最近曾在長春失却自由之美國新聞記者，對於共產軍之迅速進入理東北表示驚訝，因在日本投降時東北方面幾無共產軍。鮑氏引　此輩新聞記者之言云：共產軍之估領工作與鮑軍之推退密切配合，並謂，內蒙似亦將落入新蘇共產政權之手，而成為蘇聯在亞洲之另一傀儡政體。渠認為日下共產軍勢力之擴大，證實政府官吏在　每期間之所表示之見解，即共產黨對於改善其自己之地位較抵抗日軍更為努力。鮑氏稱：「前途不能樂觀，共產黨控制之中國，對美國不能友好，但在另一方面，內戰如一旦爆發，則將使整個振興計劃成泡影。」</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十六日合眾社電〕美作家張伯倫於華爾斯日報撰文稱：美國傅統政策，願見中國不遭分割，門戶開放政策，應予確切遵守，中國東北目前情况，極具重要性，朝鮮目前分割，應告終止，一國之分割，恒導引不需要之貧乏及痛苦產生。</p>
<h3>政院將增設兩部　翁文灝張嘉分長農礦工商　京巿長滬警局長將繼續留任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國防最高委員會已議決白崇禧任國防部長，陳誠為參謀總長，惟戰略顧問委員會委員須待國防部成立後決定，聞政院擬增設農礦，工商兩部，將由翁文瀕張嘉　分任部長，王雲五對經濟部長一戰，雖曾一度謙辭，但以各方屬望甚殷，將　膺艱巨，於六月一日就職。又京巿府易長一說，已成過去，上海巿警察局長一職，仍由宣鐵吾繼續努力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國府各院部終繹還都，其中除外交部職員，已全部還都外，其餘各院部尚有一部滯留陪部，約計仍有二千餘人留渝，靜候變通工具載之來京，如內政部目前僅到三十餘人。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十六日電〕救國日報稱：組織部長東立夫，有出任江蘇省政府主席可能，又前兵役處長鹿鐘麟，有將任安徽省政府主席說。</p>
<h3>王雲五下週晋京　此去做事不做官</h3>
<p>〔中央社本巿訊〕中央社記者昨記新任經濟部部長王雲五氏於私邸，王氏為我國唯一自學成功之事業家，亦為參加中樞組織唯一無黨無派之新人物，氏　髪已蒼白，而體力精神，無遜少年，昨衣上青色中山裝，足穿打有補釘之深黃色皮鞋，在其簡單而樸素之客　中，接見記者。發語曰：到昨日上午為止，余尚希望倖免此新任命，但行政院旣已發表，余亦自當竟盡國民之天職。余年雖將屆六十，而尤未至徵兵限制之年齡，在政治復員之時，國家須用余，余自當為國努力，故當蔣宋兩先生在京徵求余同意出任經濟部長時，余即表示，余不是來做官，是來做事，做事則必絕對負責。然余以往雖從事於實業，惟偏重於文化方面，對經濟缺乏經騐，故猶須學習，於日內將先訪各尃家有關方面及人民代表請敎研究，預定於下週內晋京就職。記者詢以經濟部人事有否更動，氏極贊英國之文官保障，余出任經濟部長，以不更動人事為原則，且經濟部工作人員，均為專門人才，翁文灝先生道德文章，又為人所欽佩，在翁氏領導下之經濟部，自整整有條，毋須有若何更動也。對中國經濟前途，氏謂：「事在人為」，經濟作戰並不較武力作戰更困難，僅須全國一心一德，則經濟前途，自有辦法。關於中共問題，氏希望有合理妥善辦法解決。王氏為政協綜合小組之代表，記者詢以小組何日可在南京開會，氏謂小組代表現均已到達京滬，各主皆希望早日召開，以解決各項問題，惟召開之期，現尚未決定。最後氏謂：余已辭去商務印書館總經理之職，析擬從事於文學研究與著作，今則不能不暫放棄此計劃矣。</p>
<h3>鮑萊將來京　賠償事數週內可決定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕據悉社魯門總統賠償問題顧問鮑萊，可能於十六日左右白朝鮮來京。又聞美方對日工廠何者應予保留，何者應作賠償，數週內當有詳細決定。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾夫婦飛京　蔣主席夫人亦同機偕返</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕馬歇爾特使偕夫人於十六日下午由滬乘機抵京，下機時為四時十三分，蔣夫人亦同機返京。蔣夫人下機時，神情至表快慰，記者曾詢其左右關於馬歇爾夫人之病况，據稱：馬夫人並無病象。並據馬夫人稱：彼能獲得此短程之旅行，深感愉快云。馬氏等於四時十五分離機塲，車至中華門時，適蔣主席乘車至，當即停車，互相招呼問好後，旋同往宮邸休息。</p>
<p>〔中央社本巿訊〕五星元帥馬歇爾特使，於前日自京來滬，探視夫人病况，在滬前後逗　未及三十小時，昨午二時半，匆匆携其相處數十年之夫人乘機回南京。馬氏此來，有何特別任務，美軍方面未披露，但云渠乃尃誠來接夫人回京而已。馬元帥有兩子一女，其長子於此次大戰中，在歐洲殉國，馬夫人哀思未已，今年三月，隨夫來華，身體未見佳勝，至今仍在修養中。</p>
<h3>增强軍事防禦力量　東北劃五綏靖區　停戰問題尚未獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕記者頃走訪某要員，叩詢大局之關鍵，據告，大局之安危，只緊於一「誠」字。現國人對中共之不「誠」，已羣感失望，然政府仍以最大忍耐，最大決心期待中。而難題之癥結，則不在新方案舊方案，此可於中共代表最近之言論見之，沉悶之時期尚未過去。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕白魯德十五日下午返平，彼在機塲告往迎之蔡文治·羅瑞卿·彼南京之行，獲有有關調處工作之協議，但未明言此項協議是否即外傅之只要兩方面同意，即可通過之軍事調處新辦法。白並稱，最重要之東北停戰問題，尚未獲解決，但在馬歇爾居間斡旋下，蔣主席　十一日起已直接參與東北問題之商談，此等會談白亦在座。另悉，白魯德此行除就中原問題獲有協議，而使此「嚴重局勢」暫告平定外，彼對於解決東北問題協商，亦有相當助力，蓋彼為執行調處數月於茲之直接担當者，倘外傅之調處新辦法屬實，殆即其根據其數月居間調處經騐所促致之應付當前難題之新辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報北來十五日電〕某記者頃向軍調部共方參謀長羅瑞卿提出一問題，謂接到京電報稱，東北停戰可能在今晚簽字，是否屬實，羅稱未聞白魯德作此語。又關於外傅南京同意即可通過之調處表決新辦法，羅亦稱白魯德僅謂有一協議，但未確言為如外傅之協議，羅對此傅說口表懷疑。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕中共有力者告記者謂：東北未停戰前，不能期待各地破壞交通情勢有所改善，目將日漸惡化，彼不否認公主嶺將有大會戰，有一部份人士，對東北以至關內之整個趨勢，是否靜待長春問題解決而泩變化，頗為擔心。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕軍調部政府方面新派劉建議少將，夏嘉富少將，為東北第廿八·廿九小組組長，十六日晨飛瀋。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十六日電〕新生報載：杜聿明將軍已下令，將東北分為五個綏靖區，藉以增强軍事防禦力量，每區調綏靖主任一人。九十四軍軍長牟廷芳適自瀋陽抵此，據稱：四平街日內即可完全收復，惟據共方消息，共軍於四平街戰事中居有利地位。</p>
<p>〔合眾社瀋陽十六日電〕據此同杜聿明同令部消息：過去廿四小時中，國軍已沿自瀋陽通往各池之鐵路綫伸展其控制地區，瀋陽方面有種種徵象顯示國軍于鞏固其基地，並將共產軍逐出交通綫地帶後，可能在未來數星期中，向四平街與長春方面發動大規模之總攻擊。昨日起國軍已開始向集中於瀋陽，四平街間鐵路綫東側之共　軍三萬至四萬人進攻，將其向東逐退四十里。</p>
<p>〔又電〕瀋陽高級共方人士透露：張學　　部盧誠操（譯音），現在四平街指揮共軍防務，並稱：盧氏並非共產黨員，一九三七年時為第五十三東北軍內一軍官，在西安事變之前，該軍係由張學良個人所統率。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十六日電〕報載，熱河赤峯及長城喜峯口一帶正激戰中，共軍意在向遼寗推進。</p>
<h3>執行小組工作　不得妨礙留難　白魯德在京商獲協議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕確息，非如外間所　傅，而為僅限於執行小組行動之協議，該協議要點分二：（一）任何方面部隊或機關，不得對執行小組之行動有所阻碍或留難。（二）執行小組之任何一方，提出赴某地調查調處或其他，倘得其他一方同意，即可成立，單獨一方無否決權，但此新辦法不適用於執行小組商決具體問題，更不適用於其上之軍調部或三人小組，僅限於決是執行小組之行動。蓋過去執行小組之行動，即遭各地部隊借未達到上峯命令所施之留難或阻止。又當某方提出執行小組須赴某地視察，調處時如某方感覺於已不利，即以反對而否決，致使許多問題之解決遭阻碍。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕白魯德山漢抵京後，曾對加快執行部及小組調處工作效率有所建議，其後軍事三人小組商獲改進辦法，普簽定指示文件，發交軍調部，其中主要內容為（一）規定小組調查政府，中共應有同等機會及可由小組美方代表提出調查程序草案，再經三方協議執行，如難獲協議時，得提交執行部，於廿四小時內解決。（二）對於以虛偽情報要求小組調查者，三人會議可採取有效制裁辦法。（三）地方當局應保護與協助小組工作，不得妨碍遲延小組行動。</p>
<h3>北寗津浦兩路　共軍破壞情形</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕此間獲悉，共軍近日破壞鐵路情形如次：（一）北寗路車通至前所，前所以東情况不明，據推測高嶺已被共軍攻佔，該地共軍十倍於國軍，聞一部國軍完全陷入共軍包圍中，前所以東之共軍，正大肆破壞，路軋已被運走，錦榆綫近數日不能通　（三）津浦綫滄縣以南，今日無戰事，惟泊頭，馮家口仍在共軍手中，昨下午二時至四時，磗河發生大火燒，毀民房甚多，共軍正以小型火車在磗河以南運輸軍隊。（三）平津段北倉北方六里許逐南莊，昨夜十二時有共軍三千餘乘虛進攻，經國軍迎　，至今晨五時退去。又黃村西南唐格莊，共軍徵得民夫四千，有破壞該路準備。另一方面，國軍於今晨五時收復安次縣，共軍撤退時，發生大火燒。</p>
<h3>蘇軍全部退出東北　董產平團長已接正式通知　外部所提詢問尚未獲答覆</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕外次劉諸今日稱：隨蘇軍駐海參　之軍事代表團團長董產平，已接蘇方正式通知，說明蘇軍已全部退出東北，大連乃東北之一埠，當亦在撤退之列。惟外部前向莫斯科正式詢問蘇軍已否悉數撤退，迄今未接答覆，依照中蘇條約，蘇方得利用旅順為　軍根據地，大約該地蘇軍並未撤退。或以東北軍事局勢動　不定，蘇外交與鐵路人員均已撤退說相叩，劉氏稱，國府近曾同意在瀋陽設蘇聯領事館，然蘇方駐東北各地領事尚無到任者，如果十天以前東北已有蘇方外交官員，必係蘇方前派駐偽滿之代表。至於撤退鐵路人員，蘇聯大使館已通知國府，其原因為「缺乏保護」，國府答以長春鐵路中國方面人員已奉令留職工作，希蘇方亦然。</p>
<h3>瀋陽京滬間　籌備直接通話報</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕東北電政正積極加强中，東北區電信交通接收委員辦事處即將撤銷，成立交通部第九區電信管理局，並積極籌備瀋陽與上海，南京直接通報與通話，負責主持東北電政在平曾購辦大批電信材料，並向滬電信局商借五千瓦站綫，電話報機各一部。</p>

<h3>粵港交通現狀</h3>
<p>— 本報駐港記者　林友蘭</p>
<p>香港陸軍思量菲士廷將軍八日因公赴粵，十日招待廣州各報記者發表談話：「廣州與香港為姊妹都巿，必須互相熟悉彼此間之環境，聯絡密切……現香港已自軍政移交民政，惟傅統政策不樊，其與中國之友好關係，亦不改變……目前世界各地，均感受戰後糧食不足，治安混亂，粵港兩地亦不能例外……」菲士廷將軍是乘英海軍快艇赴粵的，就在他發表談話的同日，廣九交通綫發生了一宗「死傷十餘人損失二萬萬」的空前慘劫案，轟動了粵港的社會。</p>
<p>廣九鐵路的輕便快車，十日上午七時，自廣州開出，駛至南崗附近，有匪徒十餘人突自山坡間開槍向快車密集射擊，路軋上跟着發生地雷爆炸，一連三聲巨響，車頭立刻粉碎，司機和乘客三名，當即慘死，車長和旅客九名重傷，三名輕傷。匪徒呼嘯登車，分頭　索旅客財物約廿分鐘，然後逃去。</p>
<p>旅客中損失最大者為一商人，携有國幣七千萬。省府高級職員梁某，亦携國幣五千萬，另一商人携港鈔三萬元，悉被劫去。據目擊的乘客稱：匪徒均穿黑色便衣，持日本手槍，中有一匪掏出印着「朱光康」三字的　片，對旅客自稱為紅軍，着勿驚慌云云。</p>
<p>出事所在地的南崗，位居東江要衝，二十年前，是一般東江綠林　聚之處，現為號稱「東江　隊」的共黨的外國，距廣州約廿三公里。出事所在地的附近山坡，原築有　堡一座，聽說是日適因守軍換防，舊的已去，新的未到，故有隙可乘，造成那塲慘禍</p>
<p>廣九鐵路戰前是相當安全的，此　發生後，粵省當局極為重視，現正嚴密查究，傅將頒佈聯防聯保與連坐法，以維交通，保障旅客的安全。自十二日起，鐵路沿綫險要地方，都已加派兵士，荷槍實彈，結隊巡邏。廣九鐵路是南中國交通最重要的一根神經中樞，保障行車安全實屬必要。廣州和香港的陸上距離，雖祗有短短的一百十二英里，但兩地的交通要是中斷了，洋貨運不進，土產輸不出，便活像兩個不相往來的星球了。粵港交通，除了鐵路外還有輪船，但戰前的廣九快車，每日開出兩班，仍是人山人海。火車行程祗三小時，輪船航程至快也要六小時半，所以旅客多捨舟登陸，如有緊急的事情，一天之內，即可往返。戰後因為煤斤缺乏，路軌失修，機車陳舊，行車時間比戰前增加兩倍。至快也需八小時以上，每天祗告清除，輪船行走，恢復不久，船隻缺乏，班期縮少，平均兩天祗有一班。鐵路富局最初擬仿戰前辦法，每天加開一班，但車廂不足，機車失靈，無從着手。無法之中想出了一種輕便快車，這種快車，有卡車和機車各兩輛，機車由汽車，引擎改裝，以電油為動力，每輛可載客九人至十二人。出事那班車計載有乘客四十一名，包括女客五名。</p>
<p>輕便快車行駛全程，約需五小時，尚不及戰衣的特別快車。收費比特別快車約高一倍，旅客為節省時間，亦多趨之，想不到開行不及一月便遭了這塲慘禍！廣九交通隨着南中國的復員，現正一天比一天頻繁，絕不致因為這塲慘禍而受影響。反之，這塲慘禍恰好提高當局對於加强廣九交通的決心，並引起國內人士從新認識廣九鐵路的重要性。</p>
<p>廣九鐵路是運接粵漢鐵路的，粵漢鐵路在當局積極修　下，半年內將可全綫通軍，把華南和華中連接一起。粵漢鐵路在抗戰時期所肩担的重大任務，預料在復員時期將更有輝煌的表現。不要說遠的，湖南現正鬧着飢荒，可是因為交通關係，數萬噸的聯合國善後救濟總署運來的糧食，却滯留在香港的堆綫裏，無從趕運接濟，聯總最近也運到大批鐵路器材和車卡，協助恢復粵漢鐵路。</p>
<p>為了加强南中國的交通，當局於兩月前已撥巨款開始修整廣九公路。廣九公路由九龍至中英邊界深圳的一段，至日軍投降時，全無損壞。但由深圳至廣州的一段，則日軍破壞於前，共黨破壞於後，現經當局四出搜羅違路材料，召集專門技工，加緊趕修，聽說六月十日將可全部通車，屆時廣九鐵路「如虎添翼」，南中國的交通，將有飛躍的進展。粵港的空運，自開關以來，也頗順利，全程僅四十五分鐘。（五月十三日）</p>

<h3>侵長共軍多匪偽　所謂「民主聯軍」如此而已</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十六日電〕記者自去歲十月迄長春陷落，在長工作半年，願向國人指出下列事實，此項指揮進攻之周保中，中共派他為「吉遼軍區司令」，現又兼任長春衛戍司令，他就是去年十月十一日間活躍於長春的「黃中校」，去冬十二月廿二日，國府正式接收長春以後，這位「黃中校」退出長春，即以「周保中將軍」的名銜，於十二月廿七日在吉林以南一百廿里叉路河地方，用汽車迫載了長春周國五六縣的士紳，舉行了一次「吉林省人民代表會」，於是「周保中將軍」又因為被「選舉」而變成「吉林省政府主席」，在那代表會裏，同時並選舉了在重慶的周鯨文為副主席。這次進攻長春的副指揮張慶和，就是十一月初旬長春公安總局長，小央接收人員十一月十七日第一次的奉令撤退，就是遭受張「局長」的威脅和騷擾。趙市長君邁接收時，他就奉命令率部隊退出長春，幾月來輾轉裏脅於農安德　地區，這次回來，他升任為進攻的副指揮了。他是一個偽滿軍官，記者在長春時，曾看到日本雜誌上載着他於「康德十年」時出席「鼓無國民戰者座談會」的演詞，現在却被援引成為「民主將軍」的幹部。長春市共軍的「市長」也是去年十一月間繼續在長春代　　元之後做個十六天「市長」的劉菊英，後因我政府的交涉下台退出，今年一月以來，即担任周保中「主席」的「秘書長，」盤據在吉林叉路河盤石一帶，即是在長春的典型的匪偽。據說他和李運昌有親戚關係，以上三位的捲土重來，不過去年十月十一日間局面的重演，所不同者，加上了延安的彭　，林楓而已。從外國調回來的「黃中校周保中將軍，」劉菊英「市長。」偽滿的「遺少」張慶和，加上延安來的彭真林楓之流，三位一體，便造成長春的現局，這現局是從去年十月以來，就是早已誕生了的。這種三位一體的形態，同樣可以說明整個東北問題的本質，從現在長者幾個粉墨登場的人物中，我們可以瞭解所謂「民主聯軍」和「自治政府」的意義，希望國人特別注意，那「聯」和「自治」幾字所包函共產黨奪地盤不擇手段的做法</p>

<h3>政府最近的人事更動</h3>
<p>中央常會及國防最高委員會前天先後開會，除調整中央黨部組織實行緊縮而外，並選任彭學沛氏偽中宣部長，以繼吳國楨氏調長滬市之後，此外更任命兵工專家　大維氏為交通部長，科學管理專家王雲五氏為經濟部長，兩氏皆為無黨無派者，以示政府廣　社會賢達共圖治理之誠意。同時復調整國防軍事機構，將軍事委員會，軍令·軍政·軍訓·政治等部，合併而成一國防部，並任命軍路家白崇　氏為國防部長，青年將官陳　氏為參謀總長，定於六月一日正式成立。此為國民政府還都後第一次人事更動，亦可謂中央政府改革黨政軍機稱，「增進行政效能，整飭各級機構，劃清　　，取消一切駢枝機關，簡化行政手續，實行分層負責」的第一步。我們希望政府與民更始·已非一日·故政府此次初步調整，值得大家重視。</p>
<p>以政治常識及各國實例觀之，人事更動以及局部改組，在政治上原是尋常茶飯，因為政治上最重要的是政策，而不是人事。不過我國目前政治，尚未完全脫離「人治」的階段，往往有「人存政舉，人亡政息」之感，故人的進退，常常可以影饗到事的興革。這次中種人事的更動，究竟是否含有改變政策的意義呢？還是僅僅以增强行政率為出發點呢？</p>
<p>我們並不諱言，目前中國的政治殊難令人滿意，亟待革新的地方，實不在少。全國人民所引領而望者，無非政治協商會議所通過的「和平建國綱領」能够次第實現，質言之，也就是改組國民政府容納各黨各派人士參加，並於五月五日召開國民大會制定憲法，以走上民主政治的正軌。無如中共在東北則製造戰事，在關內也到處　擊，而對於憲草既固執成見，不肯稍讓。對於政府改組及國民大會，父拒不開出名單，以致人民望眼欲穿的國民大會，不得不再度延期，改組政府也同遭攔置。但是中樞政治亟須與民更始，力圖振作，萬不能長此因循，使人人存着「五日京兆」之心，　政效率更形低落。於是中樞當局決定自動局部改組，同時延攬社會賢達參加，以加强行政效能。我們相信政府戰後建設的根本政策，決不受人事更調的影響。再以繼任部長的人選而言，王雲五與俞大維二氏，都是無黨無派的專家學者。我們在學術文化方面，雖反對「學優則仕」的錯誤思想，似是在今日的中國，政府如能延攬國內的專家學者參加政府，出任要職，終是一件值得　　的事情。政府對終政治民主化，不僅奉為最高原則，而且已經開始向這個目標　進。我們敢說，這次中樞人事更動，是中國政治走向民主化的第一步。反之，讓我們來瞧瞧素以「民主」為幌子的中共，除了在口頭上亂嚷民主而外，左政治上，究竟有什麼讓人民作民主化的事實，表現出來！</p>
<p>在中樞人事更動之前，上海市政府也恰恰改組，行政院例會任命吳國楨氏為上海市長，而市府祕書長，財政局長，衛生局長，她政局長也均已更迭，新市長不日即將　各新局長來滬就職。這又赴戰後的上海市政轉入新階段的開始。上海是華洋雜處的國際都市，在過去有租界的存在，向視為罪惡的淵藪。迨抗戰軍興，上海初則渝為孤島，受盡敵人的壓迫，後又成為陷區，直接遭受敵偽的摧殘與荼毒，幾乎成為人間最黑暗的地方。去秋日寇乞降，日月重光，前住市長錢大鈞氏隨着國軍開入而到達上海，就任戰後上海的第一任市長，迄今八月，條理維艱。上海環境素稱特殊，加以戰後不可避免的凌亂，錢氏固欲盡其極大的努力，對市政有所興革，其成效自難一蹴而幾。何况上海市民今日所最感痛苦的是物價高　，生活艱困，而掌握物資，管理交通等等，又非地方當局所能為力。求治有心，權責不屬，宜其心力交瘁，不得不倦勤而去。我們對於上海光復後第一任市長的功過如何，此際固不能率爾論斷，但我們至少可以說，對於一個地方官，要希望他負責，先該賦於他以職權，如果有職無　，一切事或至少若干種的事　，受到各方的牽製，則謹慎者將無事可為，　點者有　可諉。這種　　　　，這種風氣不變，我們　　　　換一百次的地方長官　　　　於事的。</p>
<p>因此，當新市長即將來滬之前，我們願先請中樞當局儘量賦予新市長以應有之職權，地方政治為地方長官之分內事，中央督導鞭策，已足盡推進之態事，正不必事事全由中央各部門直接來管。如何檢討過去，策劃未來，把握現實，以建設戰後的大上海市，殆為我上海四百萬市民共向的願望，亦為新市長應有之抱負。記得抗戰前的上海市政府，當時雖有租界存在，其所管轄的區域有限，但因有其一　的計劃，就是要建設一個合於理想的大上海。這理想雖因抗戰軍興而未能完全實現，但是那時市府治事的精神和人事不當更調的作風，至今猶為市民所稱譽。所以我猶希望新市長在他的權責範圍以內，發揚市政府戰前的政策及精神，建設大上海，尤望中央先賦以權而後課其責。</p>
<p>此外，我國政治尚未實行文官制，往往因首長的更迭，連科貝辦事員也往往多數調動。王雲五氏昨天談話，說他到經濟部後決不輕易更動人事，實可欽佩。做公務員已經够苦的了，還要「齊走公卿之門，侍候於　貴之側」，隨着政潮沉浮，不　　他個人　經濟，　　社會國家也是不經濟，這樣，行政絕對不能走上軌道　。　　，　　　　　　和上海市府此次更調　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　！</p>

<h3>英政府在下院宣布　印度聯邦組織綱領　設臨時政府事由印督全權處理　內閣代表團定月杪離印返倫敦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：英首相艾德禮今日下午二時（格林威治時間）在下院宣佈包含六大綱領之印度聯邦計劃。此項計劃係由英內閣訪印三人代表團所擬定，因在新憲法起草期內，印度領袖對於印度獨立反臨時政府計劃之談判，已告失敗也。所謂六大綱領如次：</p>
<p>（一）成立印度聯邦，包括所謂英屬印度及印度之六百部落。（二）成立中央行政部及立法議會。任何主要問題，必須獲得立法議會及國大黨與回教同盟多數人之贊同，方可通過。（三）政府其他問題（剩餘問題）可交由各省處理。（四）部落亦維持其全部權力，而不移讓聯邦。（五）各省得成立分區，而分區亦可成立行政部與立法議會。（六）在聯邦及各區憲漢中，規定任何省立法議會可在第一度十年後及以後每十年中，以投票方式重新考慮憲法。</p>
<p>內閣代表團同時提議成立過渡政府，所有各部均由印人處理。</p>
<p>又訊，艾德禮在下院承認英代表團在印之努力完全失敗。並謂，甘地所予英方之答復，祗有兩個字「退出印度」。甘地並煽動印人在各地騷擾，但已敉平。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：英內閣代表關決於月底前離印返倫敦，所有組織臨時政府事，將由印督魏菲爾全權處理。</p>
<p>調和兩派要求顧全各邦利益</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里十六日電〕印度今正等待英內閣使命團宣布其關於印度獨立之建議。勞倫斯勳爵於倫敦及新德里同時發表公報後，即將作十五分鐘之廣播，事後再會同克里浦斯及亞歷山大召開記者招待會。翌日當續開記者招待會，印督魏菲爾於星期五夜亦將作十五分鐘之廣播。內閣代表團今日或當召集印國大黨及回教同盟代表，討論其建議，國大黨前任主席阿柴特·現主席尼赫魯以及甘地，均被邀出席。回都同盟會長真納於西姆拉賀桌會議破裂後，始終未曾出面，故當由其秘書阿里甘出席。英內閣代表於建議正式宣布前，力守秘密，大約內閣代表所提出者，乃長期性之建議。事前對回印兩派最低限度之要求，以及印度各邦之利益，均曾予以考慮。一般預料此項建議，與內閣前所宣布之原則，不致相差過遠。</p>
<h3>日本政治僵局打破吉田茂受命組閣　廣羅人才新內閣具有保守性質</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東京十六日廣播：今日下午二時四十五分，日皇下令吉田組織新內閣，應付戰敗後各種問題。幣原辭職後賡續二十四日之政治僵局，今始獲打破。古　自高中退出後，即趨首相官邸着于詮衝新內閣閣員，並發表談話，謂日皇以糧食問飄等急須　決，　業完成組閣事宜。又稱，尋常廣播人才，克服艱難，完成舉國一致之態勢。刻組閣工作以國務相石黑為參謀，自由黨　原悅二郎及進步黨總裁幣原為顧問，迅速進行中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十六日電〕所此間政界觀　，吉田內閣將具有保守黨性質。自由閣員將居大部份，進步黨居少　，甚至有一部份協同黨員，亦未可必。各該黨縱非極右派，至少亦屬右傾，而以民治為標　。吉田內閣將無社會黨或共　黨罵在內，該兩黨已決定組織反對黨。</p>
<p>閣員人選</p>
<p>〔改造社東京十六日電〕聞業已內定之閣員人選，大致如下：首相兼外相：吉田茂（自由黨）。內相：松村義一（貴族院）。大　：有　　山（自由黨）或小　利得（同）。司法：（留任），岩田富造（貴族院）。文部：（留任）安信能成（貴族員）。農林：河合良成（進步黨）。商工：星島二郎（自由黨）。厚生：大久保留次郎（自由黨）。遞信：一松完吉（進步黨）。國務：幣原喜車郎（進步黨）。齋藤隆夫（進步黨）。植原悅二郎（自由黨）。石黑武重。此外聞因憲法關係，著名學者美濃部達吉及自由黨金麥德次郎，兩者中之一，亦有入關可能。</p>
<p>吉田內閣必係短命內閣，其所負使命，僅係在議會通過憲法草案。共黨則指摘吉田會任田中內國外務次長，有所貢獻於田中之侵華政策，渠又自一九三〇年出任駐英大使，支持侵略中國之外交政策，與自由黨前任總裁鳴山同樣應予　　。</p>
<p>吉田小史</p>
<p>〔改造社電〕日本新首相吉田，今年六十九歲，生於四國土佐，平民出身，一九〇六年畢業於東京帝大政治科，應外交官考試及格，即入外務省服務。一九二〇年任對德媾和條約實施委員。一九二八年任田中內閣外務次官，吉田之英國紳士式外交手腕，此時漸為人所賞識。一九三〇年任駐義全權大使，一九三二年任洛桑賠償會議日本代表，一九三六年任駐英大使，一九三九年免職，在野凡六年。日本投降後，九月出任外務大臣，兼「終戰連絡事務局」總裁，辦理停戰後事務。吉田於戰時常對東條內閣主張和平論，致曾吃三個月憲兵隊臭飯，但終不屈其說。近衛勸日皇放棄毫無希望之戰爭時，亦常向吉田諮詢。此間人士謂吉田雖屬自由主義者，但決非民主主義者。担任首相後，前途艱難險阻，殊不容樂觀。</p>
<p>政潮過程</p>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十五日電〕自從幣原內閣辭職以後，日本的政局一度陷於混亂狀態。社會黨和自由黨領袖對於組閣問題，經過長時問的討論後，社會黨決定把首相一席讓給自由黨，不過自由鱟在新閣中必須推行社會黨的經濟政策，因此一般人郡希望日本建立一個聯合政府。但是自由黨領袖鳩山，是一個機會主義者，譬如在軍閥執政時代，鳩山贊成法西斯主義，但是在聯合國軍隊登陸以後，却大談其民主理論。當幣原派遣吉田外相向麥帥建議，擬推　鳩山組閣時，麥帥為順從輿情起見，拒絕了他的建議。之後，社會黨書記長片山很有組閣的意思，可是保守派各黨一致表示不願參加片山所組的新閣。社會黨在議會中不是一個多數黨，即使連共黨算在裏面，也不到一百席，如果由社會黨單獨組閣，當然是組織不起來的。自吉田就任自由瓽總裁，經幣原　　，今日受命組閣。保守派政府明日即可誕生。日本輿論界的意見，認為保守派出來組閣，不能解決人民的主要問題，因為吉田是代表日本的地主·資本家·和政客的。唯有社會主義　能解決日本當前的主要問題。</p>
<h3>日戰犯審訊需時一年　今日繼續開庭</h3>

<h3>日所掠古物送還我國</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十六日電〕麥帥總部已將日軍在華掠取之周口店古物，送還中國駐日代表團，將分裝七箱運回中國。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕據悉：日本政府已於五日九日通令全國，凡自「七七」事變後曾由中國，越南，暹羅，馬來，荷屬東印度，菲律賓等被日軍佔領之地，用强制手段沒收或掠奪所得之物資，而現存日本者，將由日政府查明沒收，並限令全國各地於本月二十日以前詳細呈報·駐日盟軍總部復限令日政府於六月二日以前就日本掠奪所得物資，提出清冊，並負責保管，禁止此項物資之交易或移動。內中屬於我國之文物物資，當由我國收回。</p>

<h3>四國外長會議　今日起休會　對德國問題決指派專家討論　召開和會日期仍未定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：四强外長會議集議迄今，業已四週於茲，自始至終，陷終僵局，今日正式承認完全失敗，關於義大利及其他以前軸心附庸國和約問題，無法獲得協議，被迫自明日起休會，至下月十五日再行開會，屆時美方將以全力促使蘇方同意確定和會之開會日期。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎十五日電〕關於中國參加外長會議問題，據悉：四國外長已決定，現在討論德國問題係屬初步性質，故不擬邀請中國代表參加·美國方面謂：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾表示如有任何一國被邀參加會擴，則波蘭捷克亦當准其出席。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕法外長畢杜爾昨曾闡述法國對德國四疆及一般問題之觀點，英外相貝文則主張先對德國問題作廣泛之討論，然後再詳細考慮法國之魯爾計劃。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫則擁護畢杜爾所提先討論德國西疆之建議，其內容為國際共管魯爾與萊茵區，薩爾區則併入法國，其理由略謂：法國在過去一百五十年間，遭遇七次侵略，今為防止將來之侵略計，應將魯爾區與萊茵區在政治上與德國分離·貝文表示自當尊重法國安全之需要，但德國問題需以一個單位處理之。</p>

<h3>匈牙利驚人的通貨膨脹　一元美金值匈幣廿五億　一噸黑市飯的價錢是七十五億</h3>
<p>〔聯合社匈牙利京城十六日電〕匈牙利現在受到通貨膨脹的威脅，十億匈幣換一張鈔票，子於五月十四日在市上流通。戰前匈幣五個「本戈斯」值美金一元，可是現在美金一元就什匈幣二十五億本戈斯。</p>
<p>工人平均每月約　美金一元，吃一頓黑市飯要美金三元，但你在匈京却尋不到一個真正靠一元美金的收入而過活的人。匈牙利毫無疑義的一定有許多受苦的人民，但在匈京的戲院子裏，歌劇院及高貴的飯店裏，依然貴賓盈門，座無隙地，祇不會看見貧民的踪跡而已。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹到這樣的程度，政府迄未宣佈有什麼制止的方法。官方曾一度宣稱：凡是身邊帶有外幣的人，捉到就要處罰，可是並未發生任何效果。政府大多數的人認為要到和平條約簽訂後再想辦法，制止通貨膨脹。</p>

<p>要求解散猶太機關</p>
<p>〔路透社耶魯撒冷十六日電〕阿拉伯高級委員會決議向英駐巴勒斯坦高級專員克寗漢提最嚴重抗議，反對猶太人非法移入巴勒斯坦，並請其立即解散主持此等工作之猶太協會。</p>

<p>昨晨九時半，高院　庭長升第二庭，聞始審理唐　民案。唐對葉檢察官在起訴書中所列各點罪行，逐一辯駁，竟稱檢察官有成見，其對收買紗布一事，更狡稱，「不但確非資敵，而是敵以物資我。」語時表示似頗得意。查唐為鎭江人，五十五歲，住恩理和路三十五號。戰前素在銀行家服務，一二八太平洋戰事爆發時，唐為交通銀行總經理，在香港主持該行業務。同月廿王日，香港淪陷，唐即來滬，與敵經濟顧問小原聯絡。三十一年九月，主持該行復業。唐自任董事長，輔助偽中央儲備銀行推行業務。三十二年三月十五日，復組織商業統制委員會，在其任內，曾受偽政府之委托，强迫紗布商登記，勒收紗布十二萬餘件，供獻予敵運部。旋兼偽中央儲備銀行參事，偽中央儲蓄會監理。三十三年下半年，任偽全國經濟委員會委員，勝利後，由軍統局解送法院，經高檢處偵查，以有通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，擾亂金融，按懲治漢奸條例第二條第一款，四款，十款提起公訴。唐延章士釗左德　二律師為辯護人，僅械律師到庭。唐身材魁梧，穿新布灰色長袍，足登黃色　口皮鞋，上下整潔，雉光頭，髪已灰白，鼻上架玳瑁邊老光限鏡，面容豐滿，態度鎭靜。據供家有妻一，子女各四（最大者三十歲，最小者十四歲，）惟娶媳者僅一人。唐對起訴書聲辯極力，如（一）三十年十二月廿一日，並非香港淪陷日期。被告被禁一百十四天，始被押解來滬。（二）交通銀行復業，被告未來滬前，中行已有接洽，由敵人派員檢查監視，非與敵聯絡。（三）祗有交通銀行有利於中儲行，中儲行並未有利於交行。（四）中國交通諸大銀行均有投資於「中國蠶絲公司，」其成績為尋回敵人之獨得權。（五）收貿紗布並未資敵一絲一縷。（六）偽職各委員，均為掛名，未得同意。（七）去年九月三十日，自投軍統局，並非被捕。（八）商統會乃商人自治團體，並非通敵。唐並闡述「商統會」之成立，於商民有二利：（一）取銷軍統制；（二）物資出口無限制。故於抗戰有助，乃將計就計，辦理進出口事務，配給上海巿民布匹凡二千五百餘件，每人可得一丈五尺。對中儲行參事等偽職，唐供稱均為空職。至於中國蠶絲公司，乃因交通銀行投資之關係，而任董事，其目標為與日人競爭。收買紗布，登記者達廿四萬五千三百餘件，由中儲行出資半數，另半數由日人出黃金，故非資　，乃敵資　云，至此庭諭改期再訊。左律師要求下次提訊時，傅訊與被告有利之證人袁良，並代被告要求接見家屬。唐之長子見其老父，一時心酸，熱淚突眶而出，竟至哭泣，唐乃勸之曰：「經互問平安後，唐即被法　還押。</p>
<p>昨日上午，高院刑庭又提審黃香谷等諸奸逆，各情如次：</p>
<p>黃香谷</p>
<p>由邱推事傅訊。黃係建　人，原為上海巿黨部民運會總幹事，曾升任宣傅科長。二十八年五月，加入偽組織。歷任偽中央監察委員，偽銓敘部次長，偽社會運動委員會委員，偽全國經濟會委員等職，曾　機塲，修建公路，助敵軍用。黃對歷任偽職，諉稱均屬虛名。最後要求法官，請新聞記者免登其地下活動事，以防世人笑為丑表功，卒遭法官拒絕。</p>
<p>劉星辰</p>
<p>泰縣人，原為河南大學數授，曾任偽財政部經濟研究所研究員。偽財部參事，錢幣司長，偽浙財　長，偽上海巿政府物品配給處長，偽上海巿經濟局長。據供：在偽職任內，並未增加入民負担云云。</p>
<p>柳雨生</p>
<p>係文化漢奸，廣東南海人，三十年在香港，翌年五月返滬省親，即投入偽宣傅部任縐慕部職務，為林相生奔走，拉攏文化作家。並任中華日報編輯，一再發表謬論，宣揚「和運」。並為敵營文化機關「太平出版公司」，編篡「新國民運動論文集」，該書曾譯成日文，頗為敵方稱道。且在偽職任內，出席東京「大東亞文學者大會」，並於會後以「中」日民族互求　　文化上　解　認識之需要為　，用英　回南　華僑廣播，從事宣傅工作。但據其供稱，起置書與事實不符。並　　　絕未利敵禍國。</p>
<p>張浩然</p>
<p>皖人，四十八歲，供稱卅一年下半年投偽，任偽箔類稅局局長，至卅三年即去職，調任偽　燭稅局局長，所收稅款，均繳偽財政部，實報實銷，從未　污，故家無財產。</p>
<p>倪農祥</p>
<p>浙江人，曾於卅二年七月間，夥同李士羣·蔡年修·諸逆，以資本一千五百萬元，創辦偽立泰銀行，自任副理，而偽特工總部第一處長葉耀先，則任總理。曾藉勢高抬物價，擾亂金融。倪逆對起訴書所稱各點罪行，竟均否認。</p>
<p>徐蘅伯</p>
<p>吳　人，五十七歲，民國卅年十二月，任偽蚌埠　　局兩　員，　後又任偽江蘇省社會福利局巡迴診療所，及偽江蘇省　生事務所醫師，偽南通禁週局科長等職。在偽職任內，發給私人吸烟及烟館熱照，實行毒化政策。徐進對偽職供認不諱，惟對毒化政策事，猶圖抵賴。</p>
<p>王明逸</p>
<p>吳泉根·金運生·喬　林等，係貝當路　軍兵隊密探，去年六月二十日，往朱漢江等家中搜查，指為藏匿槍彈，詐取偽幣二千萬元，並逮捕彼等家中小孩。嗣經軍事機關將王等逮捕法辦，各犯竟稱都是種田良民云。</p>

<h3>小木橋菜囤中　軍官被戳死　妻與務兵潛逃無</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍政部直屬第三軍官大隊十三中隊學員齊蘊王，三十四歲，河北人，原在工兵第九團充當連長之職，甫由鄭州　餘來滬受訓，該中隊駐於小木橋路泰康餅乾廠內。氣携有妻兒及勤務兵各一人，　居附近殷家宅。十四日齊宿於隊部內，比至十五日午後三時左右，齊即偕其傅令兵來巿中區觀劇，其妻李氏則在家未出。迨昨晨六時餘，有農民　良麒，在殷家宅西大西牛奶棚對面菜園中，赫然發現一軍官屍體。經報常熟區警局，由副分局長黃振親率司法股警員前任實地調查，發現腹部一刀，大陽流出，咽喉一刀，喉管婁裂。屍旁遺留之兇器，係一削菜之尖刀，鋒利無比，後悉屍者即齊，乃探視其家中，已人去室空，其妻李氏偕勤務兵于成龍，携一歲餘之要孩，席捲細軟節物已潛逸無蹤。據其部屬云，李氏於民卅二年，與齊結婚，在原籍時，原有愛人，此次齊之突遭慘死，事後與勤務兵雙雙出走，或與于有嘍昧情事，致出此下策，亦未可知。該勤務兵于成龍係中等身材，面瘦長，圓形和尚頭，操河南口音。李氏瓜子臉，截髪，外罩藍布旗衫，內襯細格夾袍。行李中　有紅布被面及草黃色軍毯，値得沿途軍警加以注意。</p>

<h3>五百萬人將成餓莩　粵糧食亟待救濟　旱魃為災米價每石達十萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「行總」廣東區分署署長凌道揚氏，於昨日招待記者時宣稱：廣東省如不能立即得到充分糧食接濟，將有五百萬　民，於一二月內成為餓莩。凌氏鄭重聲明：彼於就任之前，「聯總」及「行總」常局，曾允諾供給粵省麵粉三萬三千噸，米五萬五千噸，但彼事實上收到僅麵粉九五六四噸，米一五三五噸，尚不足原額十分之二。</p>
<p>半年不雨　農田荒蕪</p>
<p>凌氏聲稱：淪陷區內除山東·江蘇·以外，廣東為人口最多之一省，總數達三千五百萬。而過去二三十年間，廣東輸入之米，實佔全國總額十份之七。抗戰八年以來，災情尤為普遍而嚴重。農田因堤防失修，荒蕪者達六百萬畝。粵人經營漁業者有八十萬人，而其藉以為生之漁船三萬，幾全為日人破壞。加以天氣亢旱，半年不雨，米價遂達十萬以上，粵民顚沛困苦，可謂至斯已極。廣東分署所得食糧旣遠不及原定數額，自令粵人極感失望，因之亦即引起對「行總」工作之不滿。全省救濟工作，係劃分廣州·台山·曲江·寓要·惠陽·汕頭·茂名·湛江·環山·樂會·儋縣·等十一區進行。以廣州工作而論，曾辦平價膳堂四所，每日就食者二萬五千人；粥廠十二所，每日就食者二萬人，平價麵包塲一所供應巿長民每日約六千五百人。</p>
<p>行總分署　工作一斑</p>
<p>泰國華僑，頗多原　　汕，彼等曾捐助遷米共五千一百十五噸，但此項米糧，「行總」僅負運之責，其中已有三千一百十五噸運至汕頭，一千五噸在廣州救濟，又五百噸運往海南島。此項米糧，並非「聯總」所有，遂由「行總」委託青年團·參議會·等代辦救濟事宜，間有手續未盡妥善，現張發奎將軍已着手澈查。粵分署對醫藥·舊衣之分配，及遣送難民回籍，工作均尚順利。至於工賑方面，曾動員工人十七萬，修築廣九公咱，共費麵粉三百五十噸。此路預計於下月上旬，即可完工。此外，難民從事墾荒者頗多，並曾舉辦漁民合作社三十七所，並為恢復農田起見，修理堤防，每日動員二萬一千人。並建鋸木廠，擬於每期內鋸放枕木二十萬根，供恢復廣九綫路之需。</p>
<p>請增經費　多撥物資</p>
<p>凌氏此次米滬之目的，則為：（一）向總署要求增加經費，目前每月經費二萬萬元，尚不足所需運費四分之一。（二）請總署轉請「聯總」多撥物資。（三）請多派專家，因目前救濟工作，往往僅由若干牧師及敎堂帮忙而已。凌氏旋介紹「聯總」粵分署署長馬丁氏致辭，對凌氏能於極複雜困難之環境下努力工作不懈，備極揄塲。並列舉粵省救濟工作所以困難之原因：（一）交通不便，（二）經濟不裕；（三）地理上之種種困難。彼　盼公路能即暢通，裨運救濟物資至廣西·湖南等省。凌氏最後稱：被於三四日內即將返粵。記者詢其此次來滬商洽成績如何時，答去：「我實在不敢說！」然則粵省五百萬餘民之命運，似尚在未定之天也。</p>
<h3>物資供應局成立　購美加剩餘物資供各方需要　美軍售吾船塢器具昨日簽字</h3>
<p>行政院物資供應局，昨日正式宣佈成立。辦公處設舊德華銀行三樓。據該局負責人稱：該局任務，乃根據宋院長指示，以美加借款項下，購美加美軍剩餘物資。包括輪船，火車頭，車廂，無綫電材料，汽車，飛機，照相材料，以及軍用口糧等，陸續到埠者僅一小部份，關於分配問題，則以政府機關優先供應，更以各機關在戰前或戰時申請者，先予分配。至於商用物資，當先默察巿塲需要，將用以穩定物價。其原則不外將物價保持合理水準並保障消費者之生活程度·即所謂加强購買能率，而不波動巿價。</p>
<p>又美軍太平洋各島嶼之船塢器具售與中國，作為中國海員復員，及現代化中國各船塢之用。我方已於昨日與美海軍在上海簽約。包括碼頭工具及起重機，價値一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，將於最近運抵上海。簽約時我方錢大鈞，美方柯克上將，均在塲。此種器具可助中國重建被毀之船塢。</p>
<h3>大來公司停泊輪船　被竊布疋八千餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大來公司輪船，上月二十八日進口後，停泊於浦江廿五號涇筒，（浦東洋涇和豐廠對面）靜待修理。突於本月六八兩日深夜被竊兩項，損失布疋二百餘係花呢洋布之類，）總計八千餘疋，價値法幣四五千萬元。聞該公司以損失過巨，不勝賠累，經嚴密偵查，結果已有相當綫索云。</p>
<h3>對擴大生產會議　胡西園表示意見</h3>
<p>中國全國工業協會總會常務理事胡西園，因報載社會局長吳開先氏，為挽救月前工業危機，提請巿政府從速召開擴大生產會議，特予前日謁吳局長，面陳各種意見，除表示工業界此舉之贊助外，並主張擴大生產會議，應盡量邀請工業團體代表參加，俾會議時，多得聯系。查二十八年五月及三十二年七月抗戰時期，中央政府曾在重慶先後召集二次全國生產會議，均由　蔣主席親臨主持。胡西園氏為上述二次生產會議籌備委員及工業組召集人；故吳局長對胡氏此次所提各節，頗為重視。</p>
<h3>火車行駛時刻　改照夏令時間</h3>
<p>路局已奉令，實施夏令時間，撥快一小時。又最近各班快車，自上海開出之時間為：（一）京滬綫，北站開出，七點，九點，十一點，三班，及夜快車廿一點，廿二點，兩班。（一）滬杭綫，北站開出，七點，及十四點廿五分兩班。另有西湖號遊覽專車，八點廿五分開出。</p>
<h3>南京戲院衝突案　雙方招待新聞界</h3>
<p>海軍士兵因要求入南京大戲院觀看電影，以未尊　購票，致被該院攔阻，雙方發生衝突，戲院玻璃被毀。此事發生後，社會與論譁然。日前海軍處曾為聲明立塲起見，招待各報記者，詳述衝突經過，該院職工亦於昨下午六時，假一家春菜社，招待本巿新聞界，詳述經過，又謂此次事件，仝人等當事之職員，亦蒙拘訊，雖事實俱在，警備總部必有合法之處理，但同人等為生活而服務，因執行職務致起誤會，肉體精神所受之痛苦，實難盡言。故　願各界予以同情與指導，並深順吾國軍人，對同人等痛苦能加諒解云。</p>

<p>公祭於二時許開始，主祭為孔祥熙氏，由李及　，吳紹澍陪祭，錢大鈞則因事於一時許即祭就位後，先靜默誌哀，繼獻香，獻旗，獻調，向張故土上將遺像行三鞠躬禮繼即</p>
<p>祭文曰：「維中華民國三十五年五月十六日，孔祥熙，錢大鈞，李及　，吳紹澍等，謹竭誠致祭於　　上將之靈曰。於穫我公，山左之英，勛高上將，衛國長城。淝水之戰，臨沂之捷，重創敵鋒，於斯為烈。轉戰襄河，進　　　，頒我元勳，全　是悻。是非毀譽，鎭定不忘，謀國之志，詎此庸常。公之云終，於茲六載，叱詫風雲，音　不　邇，雍容表帶，涉想猶存，丹誠矢日，黍稷非啓。靈其有知，神乎來亨，　萬斯年，凌烟式像。尚　。」</p>
<p>旋由國立音專同學唱悼歌，歌畢，孔　起氏致詞，歷述故上將為人服務及作戰之英勇，並謂當日之犧牲，實奠今日勝利之基礎。今建國尚未成功，未死者正應努力爭取一自由和平安居樂業之民主國家，其艱辛實十倍於抗戰云云。綢由張故上將之令弟自明　謝，禮成已六時許矣。</p>
<p>靈堂　絲祭文，琳瑯滿目。蔣主席親題橫額「忠烈千秋」，應於正中。本報聯：「明廉恥，矢堅貞，黨之光，國以同」「效精忠，捐軀命，靈不昧，氣長存」；顏惠慶聯：「隨棗之役，勝利之基，日月　丹忱，運捷雄風青史在」「長城而後，轉戰而死，河山榮碧血，從來名將白頭稀」。聯合日報聯：「襄水咽寒流，英靈未爽，尚念與圖未復，榛莽半墟，萬里乾坤待整頓」「蜀山埋忠骨，壯志已酬，合與明月三分，梅花一樹，千秋尊俎共馨香」。皆雋稚可　誦。</p>

<h3>全國商聯擴大籌備會　各省代表抵滬　杜月笙等昨假麗都花園歡宴</h3>
<p>（本報訊）全國商會聯合會擴大籌備會議，最近在京舉行，業已結束。各省代表：河南魯彥·管明初·王瑞琴·周錦堂·湖南陳其田·綏遠孫梅塢·以及甘肅·河北·青海·四川·合江·山西·天津·昆明等代表十餘人，相潿日由京來滬觀光。今晨將赴杭參觀，小作勾留，即返滬轉京返省。本巿巿商會杜月笙·王曉贛·徐寄廎·駱清華·葛傑臣及金潤庠，特於昨晚七時假麗都花園公宴各代表，到　公展·程滄波及各報記者約四十人。席間由王曉　致歡迎詞，表示此番在京會議共到三十一單位（原定包括東九省共四十三單位），不勝欣慰，此種精神團結，熱烈情緒，即象徵未來之光明。並已面呈主席，請召集全國農工商及專門學者，舉行經濟會議，擬具方案，切實抑制物價，發展工商業，以打破目前難關。繼由各省代表相繼報告各該省近况。當前最嚴重問題即黃泛區及湖南災情，而共黨割據地方，阻撓工商業之發展，尤為可痛。共黨在河南綏遠一帶强佔土地，摧毀禮敎，强迫骨肉離散，殘殺智識份子，毀滅生產事業，尤以破壞交通為甚。該區同胞唯一希望即盼中英政府光復河山，消除共黨破壞工作。又據鄭州中報社副社長楊擎天，談河南報業不甚發達，以開封較進步，共有報紙十二種，但最多銷路亦不超出七千份。鄭州出版四報，該地人士對於本巿申·新·大公各報極為歡迎，尤以申報銷路最暢，每日達五千餘份，超出本地報紙，但因目前交通尚困難，最早亦需二日後方可讀到。</p>

<h3>在英國所看到的　蘇伊癥結</h3>
<p>— 本報五月三日倫敦航訊　特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>聯合國這機構呱呱墮地以後，第一個確到的難關，就是伊朗問題。幸一方面有安全理事會中的諸國代表，竭力維護約章，另方面蘇伊之間，能在會外以互讓精神，直接措商，在不即不離的情態下，成立協議。今日這公案雖仍掛在聯合國的賬上，但蘇軍祇要能在五月六日以前退出伊北，這筆賬大槪就可鈎消。今後如不再節外生枝，當不致再起風波了。這案件在聯合國中爭辦經過，想國內報紙，刋載已詳，無庸多贅了。</p>
<p>美國態度　何以如此堅決</p>
<p>在安全理事會中的爭辯，乍看起來，似予是美蘇對立，尤其在紐的開會時，這趨勢似乎很顯著。幾乎處處是美國領頭，英國和其餘國家贊助。實際上，我們知道眞正在伊朗發生利害衝突的，是英蘇而不是美蘇，不過這塲爭執，如由英國出來領導，對抗蘇聯，效力恐無這樣大，因此成績恐也不致圓滿。這裏有點可注意之處，就是在這塲爭辯中，美國政府，始終同情英國立塲，是不成問題的。但美國政府的行動，常常要受到輿論的牽致，美國人民雖也同情英國的立塲，也必支持政府，聲援美國，但問題是在程度上，如果美國政府祗在聲援的地位，那末，一旦到達雙方堅持，演成僵局，甚至需要考慮到實力問題時，美國人民是否始終堅完，不惜爲了英國的利益，去冒與蘇聯兵戎相見的危險，或則不無問題。因此到了緊要關頭，英美二國態度的軟硬，有了不同，勢必影響結果。反之由美政府領導，情形便不同了，每到雙方堅持的時候，便牽連到美國的威望問題，美國輿論，不能談退縮。而英國則以本身利害有關，必需支持美國，英美能合作無間，是這次伊朗糾紛案安全渡過的主要因素。伊朗問題與美國不直接相關，美國態度，何以如此堅決呢？是否美國當局，感覺要維持聯合國的尊嚴，必需有美國的有力支持，因此，借伊朋問題來表示他支持的決心呢？還是英美少問，有外交上的諒解呢？我們常然不得而知。惟可注意的，是當伊朋問題，正鬧得雞犬不寗時，英國外交部，曾忽然致牒蘇聯，抗議其對東丸省戰利品的解釋，措詞極爲審愼，但用意是在支持美國，是很明顯的。</p>
<p>但我們如苛求一點，便知安全理事會雖說成功，但也祇是它本身平安地渡過難關，並未實際解決蘇伊間的糾紛。糾紛的眞正解決，還是兩國間直接商成的協定。不過伊朗在交涉期間，聯合國能從旁助長聲勢，使伊朗的立塲，無形中加强，因此協定能更順利的成立，到是眞的。因此聯合國的眞功用，也僅止于此。也有人說能够如此，就已不容易了。或則這話是很正確的，是合乎實情的看法。</p>
<p>一套綱羅　防範油權外溢</p>
<p>蘇伊協定的內容，主要部分爲三點：（一）伊朗北部的蘇聯駐軍，五月六日前撤退完畢。（二）蘇伊合組油公司，開發伊朗北部的油礦。公司合同，暫定五十年，首二十五年，蘇聯佔百分之五十一股，伊朗佔百分之四十九股。後二十五年，形勢恰相反。合同需要經過伊朗國會的通過。所以協定中又規定自三月二十四日算起，七個月內，以油公司的合同，送請國會批准。（三）伊朗北部的獨立運動，蘇聯承認其爲伊朗內政問題，但也認其爲一種民主的運動，希望伊朗政府能在法律範圍內和年解決。表面看來，這三點都是互相獨立的，彼此之間，並無瓜葛，蘇聯不以（二）（三）點的圓滿達成，作爲撤撤兵的條件。但實際上旣然同時商定，自然有同胞共生的關係。當此舉世求油若渴之際，伊朗小國，偏生多汕，眞是患了環實其罪之病。伊朗自身，當然也洞悉其本身的弱點，所以在立法上預先布置了一套網羅，來防範油權的落於外人之手。根據一九四四年秋，伊朗國會制定的法律，任何內閣總理，或部長站或其代表，非經國會核准，皆不能與外國政府，或外國公司交涉油權事件，吾則其結果無效。所以蘇伊關於油權礦交涉的結果，如要發生法律效力，非經國會核准不可。但我們知道，伊朗的國會，目前已解散了，且在解散前夕，又通過了一條法律，規定國土以內，尙有外國駐軍存在時，便不能舉行新國會選舉，因此蘇軍繼續在伊北多駐一日，新國會便一日不能成立。伊蘇協定中第二條約要求國會批准時限，都是適應伊朗國情的。蘇軍預定五月六日前撇盡，汕礦合同則在五月六日後約五個半月內送請國會批准。當然是預定在蘇軍撤退後的五個半月內新國會能依法逃出，協定能照預期批准。</p>
<p>舊案翻版　並無新鮮意味</p>
<p>我們爲什麼總說蘇伊糾紛，直接有關英國呢？這應從歷史的，政治的和經濟的各種觀點來看。英國傳統外交政策中一個重要的基石，是保障通達遠東交通綫的安全，如果有一敵性的强國，其勢力伸展到這條交通綫的鄰近時，他便認爲受了威脅，往往不惜用盡方法來削弱這敵性强國在這裏的力量。所以法國在中東一帶勞力强大時，英國便和法國競爭。而帝俄或蘇聯勢力强盛時，英國也便和他衝突。反之，在蘇聯方面，每當實力充沛時，便想南下，進出於印度洋上，也是一句老話，盡人皆知的，所以兩國勢力的相交差之點，也即是利害之點，總在伊朗和韃韃尼爾海峽一帶。用歷史的往例來證明，英蘇關係之和好與吾，大部是因上述二地的利害衝突是否解決或趨緩和來決定。所以最近在伊朗事件中所表現的英蘇衝突，祇是舊話重提罷了，並無多少新鮮意味。伊朗北部向來是被認爲在蘇聯勢力範圍內的，蘇聯勢力的發展，如僅止于此，英國原還可以容忍，但如駐兵不撤，繼續南下，便不免直接威嚇到英國交通綫。所以蘇聯用意，還未明顯之前，英國特別岌岌不安。而當這案件提到安全理事會討論時，英國之肯於這樣賣力，一方面是在警告蘇聯，須冒與英國衝突的危險，另方面也藉此使蘇聯明白適可而止　再從蘇伊這次所成立的協議來看，蘇聯主要目的之一是油權，假使蘇聯祇要獲得伊北的油田，英國原不致過分呌囂。但距伊北邊疆之東數百哩之處，有英國在伊拉克的油井，其南數白哩，又有英國在亞巴頓（Adalen）的油田，而當伊北民衆運動獨立時，其坎茨（Kurds）族曾向伊拉克的堪茨族呼籲過，起來作共同奮鬥，這也是使英國感到寒心的一因。所以當蘇伊糾紛案在聯合國爭辯之際，無論其在倫敦由英國領導對抗蘇聯也好，或在紐約時由美國領導對抗蘇聯也好，英全國始終關注，片刻不懈，直至糾紛吿一段落，蘇聯撤兵有期時，英國才彷彿抽了一口閒氣。</p>
<p>當蘇伊問題正甚囂塵上時，英下院曾派了幾位代表議員，赴伊朗去就地觀察，調査實情。尤其是想進入蘇軍駐區分立運動的老巢伊北，即阿日爾拜然，看看實地情形，實際上則因蘇軍擋駕，未能進入伊北，祇到達了德裏蘭，可謂未曾達到目標，但多少獲得了一點直接印象。據此行代表議員之一富特（Michael　foot）發表一般對伊朗的印象，認爲英國過去對伊政策錯誤，他說：「英國一九四一年進入伊朗的，祇有一枝軍隊，沒有政策。」至今日一般伊人僅知英國為侵略的帝國主義者，爲反動派，不認識時勢的要求，不了解伊朗人民的需求。他認爲目前在伊朗最有力量的政黨爲多特（Tudeh）黨，但多特是親蘇而反英的。然而即在多特黨與蘇聯沆瀣一氣前，已經蒙上反英色彩，據他看這是英國當局漢視新勢力發展的結果。因爲英國常地官員，缺乏遠見，祇知與常權的合作，而當局的又恰好某腐敗。一旦其權力旁落，爲人民敝屣時，恨惡之感，遂兼及與之合作的英國。今日的伊朗，就是如此。現在多特黨與蘇合作後，反英色彩更濃，是不用講了。但據他的看法，英國當以此爲前車之鑒，力事改正，吾則會影響英國在中東一般的聲望。</p>
<h3>日戰犯罪無可原文載蘇聯論壇一三六期</h3>
<p>日本一班主要戰犯正在東京受鞫，他們由簽署日本投降條件的幾個國家的代表所組成的國際法庭加以審訊。那些鼓動領導和實行對是類陰謀危害的一班人，都要受到法律的裁判。</p>
<p>世界各國對於紐倫堡暴露希特勒派各領袖的可怕的罪行，都寄以密切的注意。現在，日本帝國主義的頭兒頂兒的人物，對遠東侵略的組織者，也要受國際法庭的審判。</p>
<p>戰犯名單　日本戰犯，不但犯了發動太平洋戰爭的罪，而且在這個之前，他們的紀錄顯示他們是侵略中國的組織人和領導人，也是日本戰爭機構的主持人。</p>
<p>在公開發表的日本主要戰犯名單中，有日本前首相近衛。小磯。廣田·平沼，前關東司令梅津和南次郞，前外相松岡。重光，和谷正之，以及其他日本政府和軍部的領袖。但這些名單並不完全，其中遺漏很多，對於參加擊敗日本的各國所要求懲罰的人，有不少沒有開列在名單中。</p>
<p>日皇本人，把他神</p>
<p>日皇問題　日皇本人，把他神聖的皇帝身份擱在一旁，在全國各處作宣傳旅行，爲他願意「服務民主」的廣吿。</p>
<p>世界的輿情堅持主張裕仁應受審判。民主黨參議員羅斯洛在參院演講，要求以戰犯的罪名逮捕天皇，他說得很對。他指出裕仁是日本帝國主義的心臟，是歷史上最大侵略者之一。他又說：因爲盟國對裕仁顯示很大的尊敬，所以日本人民並不感覺他們的戰敗。</p>
<p>菲律濱一班名人曾聯名呈電杜魯門總統，指麗反動派方面意圖帮助日皇免受審判。中國報紙强調一點：裕仁雖則頒發投降命令，並暫予保留，以便盟軍佔領日本，但他的責任，並不因此而减少。最後，甚至一部份日本報紙也希望盟軍總部把裕仁送交國際法庭。</p>
<p>幣原狡詞</p>
<p>幣原雖然勉强承認必須確定誰是犯有戰爭罪的人，但他們用戲劇式態度高聲說道：「他並不同意認爲這些人是故意發動戰爭的。」幣原對於帮助戰犯卸脫責任的努力，非常熱心。</p>
<p>他堅持着說：「沒有一條法律可作爲懲罰對戰爭責任的人的根據。引用這樣的新法律，在政治上是不容許的。如果我們一定要這探做，那末就構成對我公民的生命的一種威脅。我相信，這樣的法律很容易被那班在政治上很勢的人濫用。我們能利用這樣的法律來責罰在政治上失敗的人。我相信，犯戰爭罪的人，祗應中公衆的輿論來判斷。」</p>
<p>當逮捕推近衛的命令發表的時似，幣原在國會中宣稱：政府對於此事，不應發表表任何聲明。</p>
<p>近衛之流　近衛服毒自殺，也算死得其法，因而逃避了審判。政府大多數人員，還參加近衛的出喪。奉麥帥之命拘捕戰犯的日本警察，給予不少戰犯以從容自殺的機會，因而逃避了審判。</p>
<p>佔領當局把逮捕戰犯的任務，交給日本警察，已表現出辦事的疏忽。不但如此，據聯合社指出，美軍司令部還給予一班戰犯以　天的自由，來結束他們私人的事務。那些戰犯，在這個時期內，當然能消滅一切證據和文件。有幾個戰犯，甚至爲了「商業」的原因而准許種種特權。</p>
<p>最後，美國報紙載稱：麥帥決定査閱戰犯的名單，藉以決定是否需要繼續逮捕。而且，佔領當局甚至在審判開始之前，已開釋了一部份戰犯。　有不少在覊押中的人，有很多機會和外界通訊。</p>
<p>謝罪使團　日本政府看到盟　國的寬容和健忘，已想出一種方法，使一班戰爭罪魁討得便宜。日政府決定歡「謝罪使團」向戰時受害的各國道歉求恕。</p>
<p>在日軍偷　珍珠港的計劃中，積極參加的日本前海相島田，卑微的對新聞記者說：他天天跑到明治神宮中去懺悔他的罪行。</p>
<p>指導侵略行爲的一班日政府領袖都把罪名推在陸軍的身，上陸軍推在海軍身上，而海軍又推在一班死人的身上。東條被捕的時候，表示極度的驚異，他宣佈：他曾竭力阻止戰爭，祗有東條一人纔是發動戰爭的罪行，近衛在自殺之前不久，辯稱：他的一切活動都是爲了和平的目的而服務，但是這種活動被軍閥所阻。這位狡猾的老政客在他的遺言中，還想粉刷他自己的罪名。他寫道：「我向來想和美國合作以和平的方法來解決太平洋事務，而美國竟把我列人戰爭犯中，這實在是一件遺憾的事。</p>
<p>狡滑作風</p>
<p>在首相任期內，對於希特勒派領袖的行為亦步亦趨的東條，現在正用同樣的功夫，來仿效紐倫被吿欄中一班先進同志所發明的狡滑手段。</p>
<p>三月二十七日日本時報載稱：據權威方面說：「。東條必須失去他的記憶力」在審問的時候，他不能「記憶日期和其他重要的細目。」無疑的，在未來審問的時候，日本的戰犯們會保持他們一貫欺騙，卸責。和推諉的作風</p>
<p>山下問題</p>
<p>最近，在馬尼刺山犯的審訊，就是明證。檢察官雖然提出有力的證據，並由證人叙述被吿部下日軍在菲島的種種暴行，但被吿律師向菲島最高法院上訴，要求以戰俘的地位對待山下奉文。　這班曲解是非的人甚至對於審訊山下奉文的軍事委員會的管轄權，也抱着懷疑的態度，而認爲這種審判違反美國和菲律濱的憲法。最後他們對於代管日本利益的西班牙未曾獲得審訊的正式通知一事，提出抗議。</p>
<p>等到一切企圖失敗之後，山下又向美國最高法院上訴。直到本案開始審訊三個月之後，山下纔接到最後的判決而執行絞刑。但是議山下之後，在馬尼刺受審的本間大將，又有機會憑藉法律上似是而非的技術問題而使案子躭擱了好久。　這些從已經舉行審訊的經過中所得到的敎訓，應該加以考慮，而各國對於迅速懲罰戰犯的要求，應該加以注意。日本法西斯主義者用希特勒黨徒同樣的武器，來仿造帝國主義攫取外國領土，奴役他國，人民並廢除其獨立，掠奪各國財產，破壞一切戰爭的法律和習慣，虐待戰俘和征服國家的人民——這一切，在德國帝國主義和日本帝國主義，都是同樣的作風。</p>
<h3>台東漁港：蘇澳</h3>
<p>— 本報十日台東航訊　特派員暮雲</p>
<p>以台東的地勢和實情來看，蘇澳——這侷處在太平洋邊岸的一個小鎭，實在是一個最優良的漁港。它在全台灣的產魚量上，佔有相當重要的地位。</p>
<p>作爲漁港重心的南方澳，離蘇澳二公里，記者　暑步行，爲時三刻鐘。區署在這裏設立了里長辦事處（鄕長），由里長姓黃的領導，我們參觀了日本人在這裏利用魚類設立的維他命研究工塲。去年三月二十一日，給美機炸毀了剩了個殘址，衛生局和上級機關不願意接收，讓給地方機關嚼渣滓。</p>
<p>日本人在山洞裏貯藏了大量的水雷和空雷，有一條輕便鐵絡，從山洞蜿蜒曲折，沿着海濱　着山崖通到鎭上。在小火車線的　面，是丁字型用人工建造的內港，水泥築成的，深度二三米，數百艘機器漁船和帆船都停泊在這裏，還有被海軍部接管的日本式登陸艇，三十艘成行列地泊在洋而。</p>
<p>這裏自十一月到五月，這六個月間每日生產台幣的六十萬元，從六月至十月夏期，因爲魚的生產分散販賣，每日的有三十萬元。有一個漁業公會會員百餘人，目我辦理有關漁業事項，日本人以前對魚類生產者配給漁具，頒發補助獎勵金，使生產量增加，如今政府的水產科還沒想到鼓勵和補助，而生產量却也未嘗減少，這個現象看是反常的，實際上却很單純，原因在於魚價高昻。直接鼓勵了他們的增產，使千餘的本地人和流落的五百琉球籍民，都得到了比日本人時代更安定的生活。（關於琉球藉民，記者要順便報吿給讀者的是，全台灣有五千個琉球人，他們和歐洲的吉卜賽人一樣，過着流浪的生活，最近他們感受到嚴重的不安，就是謠言着他們的財產將被接收，有識者說是留台微用日人所放的毒箭，道却是可怕的陰謀。）　擁有資本五千萬元的台灣水產公司，在南方澳設有冷藏倉庫，一間可以貯藏五十噸，另外在蘇澳有每日生產六百噸的冷凍工塲，月出五千箱的罐頭工塲，（接管後已停工）漁業全般設備都很完全。產量佔第一位的是旗魚，沙魚的翅——魚翅是上海人目中的唯一海味。在全省的產量中，占有十分之四，品質較日本出產的好，一個月以前，每斤售價八十五元，現在則飛漲到四百元一斤，尙缺貨。</p>
<p>南方澳是三面環山，人工構築的海港，相當偉大，適於避風風和隱蔽，不過因爲前年颱風的襲擊，使民房和公共建築被毀甚多，到現在還沒有恢復原狀，憲兵團有一隊在這裏維持治安，使這洋的彼岸，已深聞到中國內地的氣息。記者在月夜的海濱，謳歌着：「捕魚人兒世世窮」時，對政府給予「漫無限制」的不關心，却抱有異樣的感覺！</p>
<h3>水鄉蘇州</h3>
<p>— 本報蘇州十二日訊　通訊員吳守仁</p>
<p>號稱東方威尼斯的江南水鄕蘇州，在全中國一百二百萬方公里的版圖內，許是極微小的一點，但它嫻靜美麗的姿態，却爲大江南北數千萬民衆所懷憬歆羨。想起「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」的通俗流傳，蘇州該有着多麽燦爛光輝的歷史吧。</p>
<p>應該下種了　用什麼買米換種</p>
<p>在京滬沿線，蘇州總應該算是富庶的魚米之鄉，但時至今日，這一個幸運的名詞，已成為消逝的陳跡，不能適用于目前的蘇州了。附廓一百四十餘萬畝的產米田，縱有二百四十萬石左右白米的年產量，以每人最低限度的需要，分配給一百三十餘萬的人口，每年還得發生缺少四十萬石的恐慌。何况道僅有的食糧，幷不能完全爲蘇州人所享有。除了軍糧的收購，和地方雜色部隊的供應外，更有被鉅額糧貸所吸收的鉅額數量。距秋收雖僅幾個月的光景，而大部份的佃農已受到饑饉的威脅。他們本來是準備着渡過青黃不接時期的糧食的，可是，購槍費，自衛捐，……使他們不得不糶去有限的存糧。瞬剎間，米價漲到四萬多了，田裏也應該下種了，誰都在惴惴憂懼着：用什麽去買米？用什麽去換種？</p>
<p>物資盜賣犯　居然被越獄逃脫</p>
<p>敵人留下的倉庫密佈在四郊，從去年九月間封貯看守到現在，仍沒有聽到一絲處置的消息。「餓殍載道」，雖還是一句過甚的形容詞，而「米爛陳倉」却是最確切也沒有了。本年二月問曾暴露了一件監守自盜的賣職罪行，西跨塘倉庫管理員串通了部屬，連續盜賣大量物資。這件事雖經主管機關發覺査辦，竟會使主犯在扣押中越窗逃逸，結果是不了了之，倒霉的是代銷　物的老百姓，聽說到現在還在監禁着，他做了犯罪者贖　的羔羊。</p>
<p>蘇州新聞界，也沒有戰前那樣有生氣。現在發行的，蘇州明報，蘇報，蘇州日報，力行日報，大華報，大江南報，六家，除大江南報是小型報三日刋外，其餘是三家大型日報，二家小型日報，彼此間祗有營業和新聞上的競爭，很少從本身機構的健全上着眼。因此，新聞陣線的力量散漫，不像其他地方那樣雖在工作上有熾烈的角逐，而在精神上却維繫着可貴的和諧，過去二月間，曾由新聞從業員自己發起組織新聞記者聯誼會，僅開過三次籌備會議，到第四次就一直流產，迄至現在，還未能成立。目前惟一的新聞團體，就祗有一個報界協會，是五家日報的發行人單獨組織的惟一新聞業團體。</p>
<p>一堆堆垃圾　儼然形成小山阜</p>
<p>最後要說的是蘇州的垃圾，假使有外鄕人要探詢蘇州有什麽特產的話，記者可以毫不遲疑地答復他：「垃圾」這是蘇州有歷史性的特產。堆積在每條街的街頭巷尾，或隙地上，儼然形成一堆堆的小山阜。過去曾屢次利用日俘掃除，但終維持不了三天以上的淸潔。原因當然是去路不旺，實則附廓數十萬的佃農，正需要它去作肥料。然而搬運時的需索留難，使良懦的佃農不敢嘗試，每個淸道夫或地甲土痞，都自說自話認定一個地段，在這地段以內的垃圾，就是他們的財產，不肯讓別人隨便無代價地搬運，而們自己又不設法推銷淸除，議它他積存在那裏待善價而沽。每當晴朗的天氣，風過處，隨地捲起一大陣灰霧，在這灰霧中，我們彷彿眼看着這江南水鄕，嫻靜美麗的蘇州，一天天落後，一天天。與美境理想境隔絕。</p>
<h3>南轅北轍·自成體系　朝鮮的兩個世界</h3>
<p>據從朝鮮北部移入南部美國地區的朝鮮人表示：今日的朝鮮，實際上已分成兩個國家，具備着兩種不同的政治和經濟體系。</p>
<p>美國佔領區。由勞契少將領對的美國軍政府統治着。該政府成立於一九四五年九月、恰恰在美國佔領軍登陸朝鮮以後。駐朝鮮美軍司令霍奇中將曾經說過：美國的計劃預備在朝鮮人力勝任的時候，把所有行政權和執行僅逐漸移交與朝鮮人</p>
<p>韓人自治　不久可望實現</p>
<p>在過去幾個月裏頭，刺鮮人的這種能力已顯得頗爲高强。勞契少將接見合衆社記者時曾經說過：他相信朝鮮人馬上就能够接管所有的政府機構。後來他又說過：他相信圳鮮人已有實行自治準備，希　他們不久就能够成爲事實</p>
<p>據軍政府最近宣佈：政府　權的移交事項，實際上已經在進行中，而且進行得很快。幾個月來，政府的每一局中已同時有兩位局長，同時其他許多重要的職位都有着雙料的長官：一個是美國人，一個是朝鮮人。實際上，在多數的局裏，美國人的地位純粹是顧問的資格，而朝鮮籍的官員都做着實際的工作。</p>
<p>像金字塔　確立文官制度</p>
<p>本年初，霍奇將軍曾把美國在朝鮮的目的加以說明。他把朝鮮政府比做一座金字塔。他說：美國人正在從底層建築起那金字塔，奠定文官制度的鞏固的基礎、使得臨時政府和最後的獨立政府成立時，政府的領袖們可以穩妥地站在金字塔上而，不致有坍臺的危險。</p>
<p>軍政府遵循霍奇的政策、特地建立了一種適合朝鮮政體的文官制度，曾於上月間頒佈一道法令，規定政府的官員都須經過文官考試，把昔日由日皇任命的日本制度全部推翻。朝鮮的文官制度，完全以美國的文官制度爲準則，而且，實際上的維織事項，是由美國文官首長主持的。一切職位，都以考績爲去留標準。現任官吏，只要能够考試及格，或者資和能力使高級長官認爲滿意，就有保持職位的希望。</p>
<p>北部五省　蘇聯接管情況</p>
<p>但是在朝鮮北部，蘇聯主持下的政府制度却完全呈現着另一副面目了。當蘇聯佔領朝鮮北部時，那裏就成立了人民委員會，接收了日本投降以後朝鮮的行政機構。在美國佔領區以內也曾存在着這種組織。當美國宣佈軍政府是美國所承認的唯一統治機關時，蘇聯就接收了這些委員會，供自己利用。據刺鮮人說：他們往往把領袖和行政首長更調，而機構的軀　却沒有變動。</p>
<p>這種情形，造成了一種局面，使蘇聯有一種藉口，說朝鮮是由臨時人民委員會統治着的，而美國只能够說他們是在奠定永久政府的基礎。北部的政府以朝鮮第二大都市及工業中心的平壞爲根據地。美國政府，則設在朝鮮歷代的故都漢城。美國當局已經接收朝鮮政府，而蘇聯祗接收了北部五省的政府。</p>
<p>南北兩區　幾乎背道而馳</p>
<p>朝鮮南部和北部的共藍黨首領，已充分利用所謂一人民」政府。實際上，道個政府是御定的，據朝鮮人說，重要的職位都被共產黨員佔據着，反共份子是絕對不容許担任行政職位的　在政治上，南北區幾乎是背道而馳的。美國人准許一切黨派（從共產黨到無政府主義者），參加政治。但是蘇聯却假手於共產黨支配下的人民委員會，只支持共產黨而排斥其他一切黨派。在美國地區內，現有已經登記的黨派一百五十個，其中五個黨派，是此較重要的。但是在蘇聯區域內，只有共產黨，左翼人民黨和民主黨，後者因受政治社會變動的影響，不能繼續在朝鮮北部活動，已經把總部遷到漢城去。</p>
<p>同樣，在經濟方面，南北兩區的悄形，也是逈然不同的。美國軍隊僅把銀行和通貨接收下來，可是據朝鮮人說；蘇聯軍隊强佔銀行，自己發行軍用票。在美國地區內，政黨採取土地改革政策，把土地出售與農人。但在北部，共產黨却要把土地沒收，而送給農人。（合衆社漢城特派員十四日電）</p>

<h3>眞要打？</h3>
<p>— 了原</p>
<p>我是無黨無派的老百姓，站在客觀的地位，要說句一針見血的話，國民黨共產黨及其他的黨，與當權大員，都是替老百姓服務的。不咨氣的說，國家是我們老百姓的。你們的黨派和當權者，是老百姓的公務員，是替老百姓造幸福的，不是讓你們玩要老百姓的。你們要認淸責任，不要以爲有槍桿，就以爲國家及老百姓是你們的附屬品。你們談得好，則不用說，談得不好的話，槍對槍，砲對砲，打起來，還不是老百姓遭殃嗎？乾脆的說，你們拿老百姓開玩笑。可憐的老百姓，說話也不靈了。不讓你們打，你們偏要開火。這不是老百姓莫有主權了嗎，還談什麽民主呢？我們老弱無能的老百姓，對你們的唯一要求，就是不要打了，讓老百姓們過幾天太平日子吧，讓國家也緩口氣吧。我們國家內戰二十多年，又對日寇抗戰八年，已經是筋疲力　了，好容易政府領導，將外患消除，正是國家建設和民衆休息的時候，那能再容同室操戈呢？縱說你們各有後台的老闆，試問與我們國家和老百姓有甚麽好處呢？打來打去，還不是鷸蚌相爭，漁翁得利嗎？西班牙不是我們的好榜樣嗎？莫非你們想將國家變成墳墓，叫我們老百姓當守屍鬼不成嗎？我們老百姓要求停戰與和平，是等於零，非得要勞動盟友奔走調停，讒有效騐。我們家裏的事，要呌外人來管，這是多麼可恥的事！我們老百姓喊破嗓子，是杯水車薪無濟於事。老百姓不讓你們打，你們非打不可。我們老百姓只有喊老天爺，也只有老天爺知道我們老百姓痛苦。我們隨着抗戰八年，流血吃苦，好容易盼日本鬼子投陴了、我們好回家鄉。誰想不但不能回家，反而物價比抗戰時期還高，呌我們老百姓如何活着呢？我們聽說停戰了，交通恢復了？我們老百姓樂得手舞足蹈，誰知好景不常在，聽說各處又打杖了，交通又破壞了，停戰令也不靈了，讓我們流浪異鄕的老百姓，沒有其他的法子想，只有酒幾滴熱眼淚。可是我們老百姓還是希望你們掌槍桿的大員們，以菩薩心爲心，可憐我們老百姓吧，不要再打了。如果眞正雙方掀起全面內戰的話，我們老百姓是站在客觀的地位，也不向於此，更不偏於彼，你們同是中國人，看你們誰待我們老百姓好。打，打，打，我們老百姓看着你們打！</p>
<p>解救糧荒　梁炤</p>
<p>近來國內各地繼荒，米食缺少，餓莩遷　，情勢嚴重，呼救哀聲四起。社會然心人士，紛紛思考良法，以事補救。有主配糧，有倡節食，不一而足。歐美各國配糧政策，施行以來，大可解決糧荒問題。我國目前戶政未善，交通欠暢，或恐不得良好結果。節約雖是消極辦法，但如實施得法，未嘗無助。窮苦人家早已緊縮褲帶，澈底節約，問題僅在富有的人。他們餐必魚肉，吃必至大腹便便而後止，實在太奢費了！我們要請他們大發善心，省下食物來，拯救在死亡綫上的同胞。同時政府應急促利用報紙擴播電台，作節食的普遍宣傳，並即實行强迫性之節食辦法，如嚴禁以米糧釀酒，製餅食以及禁止食客在酒館飯店在飲大吃等等。憶廣西曾力行節食，當局於酒飯店開市時，派憲警至其間監視營業，設發現吃客吃用超過規定，即行依法懲處，結果吃風無形中漸見減低。總之，爲政在人，政府決心厲行，制法適情，未有不收效果之理。</p>
<p>閱大公報申報論文，賢士學者，各抒見地，例如選用食物，注重質地，期得富有養料的，又如講求吃法，意欲食物易於攝取消化，莫不是良好之提示。同時本人覺得我國的烹飪法，多求合口味，而不注意營養棄之保留與合乎消化，實不合科學原則。非由各衛生機關與糧食營養人士，加以研究改良不可。美國對於食米的煮法，硏究改良經已有收獲。返觀我國素稱食米之邦，仍無人注意改進，言之愧恧，難道只知享人之成果？蔬菜的煮法，燉，蒸，均不可取，炒法較好，因營養素受損較少，其次配料亦可減少。此並不甚影響菜味，但可節省食糧。先進學者應研究烹飪法，並代同胞開列菜單數種，詳明烹吃方法，廣爲傳播，導引國人採用。設能如此，料可解除糧荒之一部份困難。</p>

<h3>聆曲紀盛</h3>
<p>— 湯立言</p>
<p>樂為六藝之一，上通於文藝，下合於戲曲，子夏所謂言之不足，故長言之，長言之不足，故詠嘆之，詠歎之不足，故不知手這舞之足之蹈之。故藥擊磬樹石百獸率舞，舜彈五絃琴歌南風之詩而天下治，孔子聞韶三月不知肉味，其感人之深，非語言文字之所可及也。自雅樂淪亡，胡　雜奏，但吾民同化力之强，非任何民族之所及，故不久而羌笛胡笳琵琶三絃與琴瑟笙箏同其重要。唐代十部樂，雅樂僅居其一，其他多涼州伊州高昌乃至印度之樂，自西域傅入者也。因漢武帝，唐明皇宋徽宗之愛好音樂，故有李延年，李　年，康崑崙，黃旙綽，周邦彥諸大家，亦有李夫人，趙飛燕，楊玉環，李師師等之絕代佳人誕生，其間蔚為中國音樂之全盛時代，懿歟盛哉，千載下聞這猶為之廻腸蕩氣也，元明以降，音樂漸替，禮失而求諸野，乃有元人新劇，明代崑曲之發明，亦足以稍振頽風，海通以還，國人醉心歐美，西樂盛行，不復知有國樂，所謂音樂家者流，一若手提梵啞鈴，指彈扱霞娜，已足以盡其能事，彼扱霞娜梵啞鈴何嘗不善，惟不從本位文化着想，以吸收外來文化，舍己耘人，惟西是尚，甚至以中國為向無音樂，為可慨耳。</p>
<p>上海國樂研究會諸君子，當此風雨晦明之際，集合同志，研究國樂，挽狂瀾於旣倒，尋墜緒於將亡，成立十年，演奏多次，早已斐聲中外，尤以會長孫裕德先生潛心研究，垂三十年，於國樂有獨得之秘，而博採眾長，虛心請益，更覺難能可貴，日前應軍之友社邀請，公開演奏，以慰勞百戰將士並慶祝還都紀念。記者得躬逢其盛，耳福不淺，不可不為之記：</p>
<p>是夕共奏懷古，淮陰平楚，舞劍，月兒高，四曲。「懷古」係中原絃索，流傅至廣東大埔，一時感興之作也，用十種樂器全部合奏，間節蒼凉，有感慨邃深之味，而以南人奏之，則又別饒細膩跌宕之情，實合南北之長，次為孫裕德先生之琵琶獨奏，其曲名為「淮陰平楚」，淮陰侯韓信以十面埋伏之計，困楚霸王於垓下，霸王以蓋世雄姿，一敗塗地，自刎烏江，此調與「霸王卸甲」（一名　輪袍）同一故事，「霸王卸甲」敘項王之慘敗，別姬一段，尤為凄楚動人，（梅蘭芳之霸王別姬即取材於此）而此則狀漢軍之得勝也，故事旣悲壯而孫裕德先生指法尤為純熟，能於琵琶絃上，彈出各種聲音，始則鼓角齊鳴，三軍列陣，點將遣兵，分隊設伏，總則交鋒接戰，吶喊震天，於萬馬奔騰中，參入　聲，終則敗陣突圍，銜枚疾走，殿以劃然一響，戛然而止，使聽者恍如置身占戰塲中，目覩兩軍血戰之情形，眞神乎其技矣也。又次則為葉大密先生　冰如小姐之舞劍，配以琵琶京胡笙　四極樂器，葉先生聞為李景林將軍之嫡傅，其劍術為武當派，固已深人堂奧，內功造詣旣深，刺擊尤見神奇，　冰如小姐劍術亦精，兩人對舞，婉轉低昂，各極其致，或矯如游龍或翩若驚鴻，渾厚矯捷，豪邁超逸，兼而有之，我不及見公孫大娘舞劍，往於漢皋在敵機空襲下觀王熙春舞劍，已為之神往，作長歌以記之，一時傅遍遐邇，今見葉先生　小姐之舞劍更出神入化，不同凡俗，毋怪張顚見公孫大娘舞劍而草書入聖也，壓軸為「月兒高」「！！！」為霓裳羽衣曲之別名，霓裳羽衣曲或言為道士葉法善引唐明皇遊月宮所聞之曲，或言為唐河西節度使楊敬述所獻婆羅門曲，前說近於神話，後說或較可信，蓋本婆羅門樂傅自西凉，而經唐明皇改作者，此曲有歌有舞，大約經明皇改作後以敎梨園子弟，而此曲之得名則以貴妃楊玉環雅愛此樂，並嘗親作霓裳羽衣舞。以媚明皇，又經白樂天長恨歌之渲染，故提到霓裳羽衣序，立時有唐明皇楊貴妃之羅曼史浮於腦際，此曲至宋時已失傅，姜白石曾補散序一闋，近時吳　痷敎授（梅）得一孤本，竟係全套，曾於東南大學附中及第一女子師範親自敎授，此夕為全體合奏之音樂，而非歌舞，故論霓裳羽衣序尚有闕憾，而演奏之工已能將此中情事曲曲傅出，恍如身入唐宮矣，此曲只應天上有，人間能得幾回聞，奏畢，全體鼓掌至三分鐘不休，要求再來一個，已而曲終人不見矣，未免為之悵然，聽奏霓裳天實曲，歸來風露不勝寒，即以為此曲之殿。</p>
<h3>安南人的喇叭</h3>
<p>— 張羅</p>
<p>＂DA，DA　DA……＂鄰居，安南旅滬僑民聯合會里的安南人的喇叭又響起來了，東方剛一發白，當寢室里的同學們的游塊正徘徊在「春之夢園」里的時候。</p>
<p>這單調，貧弱甚而至於唏噓的喇叭，無休止而按時地每天響着，無論在你上課時，讀書寫字時，課餘在園內散步，或者燈下榻上，你躺着深思遐想的時候。</p>
<p>它破壞了我們的工作，攪繞了我們的安寧，然而我們却無權乃至無理由去喝止它。因為，在安南人說來，這也是他們的功課—它是安南人的代表，是安南人的聲音—是全體安南人的聲音！</p>
<p>無可奈何之下，同學們想出了一個對付的方法，那就是緊跟在它再一次的響，我們就朝地下懸　唾一口，以表示一種對它在精神上的壓惡興詛咒。</p>
<p>這一天更壞了，好幾個喇叭共同嚹了起來，正當上英文的時候；並且運參加着幾面鼓聲這些東西雜亂在一起吹打着，這可詛咒的聲音，又像是失　與悲哀；又像是控訴與不平，同時，你如果肯再細心點聽它，你還可以聽到一陣陣地肅穆，悲哀而濃厚的離別的調子夾在裏面……</p>
<p>這一天搞掉了我們一堂課，同學中最多的只唾了三口就沒再繼續下去，因為它一連氣地吹打了一個鐘頭，結果同學們推我做代表，決定走過院牆，和他們去交涉。</p>
<p>我去過了，交涉的經過是這樣：</p>
<p>「朋友！」在大操塲上，我拉住了一位矮小的安南吹鼓手以法語請敎他。</p>
<p>「對不起，我不能歡迎你同我講法國話！」他責怪中帶着親切，莊嚴地以中國話回答我。</p>
<p>我感到差愧與窘迫，接着再問：</p>
<p>「今天這是為什麽？」我也講中國話了。指着那放在一旁的喇叭與洋鼓以及蹲在它們一邊的一羣吹鼓手。</p>
<p>「喛！」他呌着，這樣我便能和你交談了，雖然我們對你們白費許多力氣……現在我們覺悟了：把所有的剩餘的力量帶回去吹去，在那裏我們相信可以激起反抗與帮助！朋友，明天我們要說再會？剛才算是向你們告別……」</p>
<p>回來之後，我徘徊在校園裏細細地玩味這些話，不久，我了解了這之前我所不能了解的那單調，貧弱甚而至於唏噓的聲音以及那肅穆，悲哀而濃厚的離別的音調……</p>
<p>是的，我們以愚笨濫用了人家許多寶貴的力氣。在我們這國度里，除去了只知道如看戲一般地看着人家打殺民主和以厭惡對付朋友的求援與敦促以外，便什麽也沒有了。</p>
<p>思考之後，我想把我所經過的與想到的告訴大家，讓他們也了解安南人的喇叭同它的聲音，進而促起他們的行動，以幹旋朋友的對我們的失望，但是，明天他們就要走了……</p>
<p>是的，明天他們就要走了，明天，所謂安南旅滬僑民聯合會，將自三間空空洞洞的如牢獄一般的洋房和一塊荒塚一般的大操塲，而安南人，我們的親愛的兄弟，將要拋下這些，向他們那雖小，然而却知道反抗與帮助的祖國的懷抱裏奔去了……</p>
<h3>夜題草</h3>
<p>— 齊梵</p>
<p>夜里，我把憔悴的靈魂納在沉默里浸了浸，呼圓夢的影子，思想如一條疲倦的哈巴狗，伏在我底脚下，一件過去的回憶泛上我的心頭。</p>
<p>當小窗下，青燈和着沉寂—想想你的史蹟，溫溫你的舊夢，有什麽呢？逝去了的一絲蜜意，一點寗靜；小巷有孤獨的夜行人，足跟敲着石板，於是夜的海上水波散開了，心在一圈圈地向四周擴展開去；又似悠悠然地從蝸牛殼似的螺旋的焦點，擴開，擴開，漸漸地綠着展放的痕，拖長了生命的里程。夜晚的幾許詩意，幾許憶念；位圖昔日的舊夢，緋紅金黃的，咀嚼着有如一枚橄欖。</p>
<p>夜的沉思，更帶去得遠了。</p>
<p>荒漠的鄉村，　渡頭更無人跡，在春花盛開的三月，背起簡陋的行囊，跋一重山，再涉一條水，夜晚的道路多崎嶇，遙遠的一點星火，是燈光還是青燐，夜風呼嘯着掠過原野。當疲倦加重兩腿，天邊現曙光，日光的紅暈昇起白畫的光明。</p>
<p>在古城，相遇又想識，你擎起多伶俐的智慧，於是你留給我一個好的憶念。山城中，古意的城頭，春日的黃昏，披着殘照，藍天上一片白雲，蓋着遠方的白楊，小河里。落日散着金光，白鷄游近，圓圓的似的水波隱蔽在青草　中。鷄趾在水面上擊出一陣陣的音符，你說，這是時，這是眞實的美。一朶野花，被遺棄的，在林間你輕輕地拾起。於是你想起拋花人，你說，這花上抹着愛與憎。終於在一個無月的夜晚里，你披着一件草綠色的上衣，乃獨自走出，上認染着夜的氣息，夜的顏色。</p>
<p>臨別無傷感，你只低地說聲「再會」，我祗望着你的背影，消失在夜的氣氛里，那時，誰能體味到偶然的別離是甜蜜還是酸辛？……如今，已五年過去了，但這小城，也該使你留念吧？</p>
<p>遠方，有青山，有綠水，有着你一個美好的環境，但是你還記得千里外舊日的友人嗎？</p>
<p>夜，依舊是那麽寂靜。我從夾着一張紅葉的書頁里，取出你給我作為留念的一幀相片，凝視着，驀地里獲使我似淡漠地追憐起你那件草綠色的上衣，永遠是一個沉　的影子。</p>
<p>疲倦下我的眼皮，但我並不想睡，我把手按住胸部，微弱地，然而却又沉重地，我聽到自己心的跳動。</p>
<p>燈搖落長夜的倦意，桌上攤着遠方人的音訊。</p>
<p>世紀是悠長的！</p>

<h3>收穫</h3>
<p>— 陳淦閣</p>
<p>黯澹的夕陽，迎着高掛着的彩霞，在初秋底江南，還企圖　放那薄弱的餘威。可是農夫們像沒有發覺這黃昏已開始籠罩着大地似的，仍舊傴下了身子，赤着脚；男的裸着半身，捲起了袴脚；女的穿了很單薄的衣裳，手中拿着鐮刀，割呀割的，儘那豆大的汗點兒，由額角滑向嘴邊，又淌到脖子，再流到胸前，才一點點地滴下泥土中去。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（三六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>翁二太太如今不姓翁了，但我們不防還是稱呼她翁二太太。槓竪我們知道她已經作了石王樓的老婆就得了。</p>
<p>翁二太太自從和石玉樓私逃到北京以後，就住在西城根的一家公寓裏。</p>
<p>石太樓照舊唱戲，但沒有在荆州時那麽紅，在北京，是名角會粹的地方，像石玉樓，只能列到三等角裏面。有錢的人，去聽荀　生的花衫戲；沒錢的人，聽富連成科班，也一個　過　。</p>
<p>石玉樓照舊吸鴉片，而且越發吸得厲害。也和翁老爺一樣，白天的時間，睡覺；晚上的時間，就在舞台上；幾乎沒有時間，同翁二太太兩人談談，玩玩；使得翁二太太依然度着孤寂冷清的生活。</p>
<p>日子久了，翁二太太而且感到石玉樓反不如翁老翁能够體貼她，遺就她。石玉樓本來就不大愛講話，如今却更沉默了，常常從早到晚，都不開口，翁二太太問他什麽，他表示同意的時候，就點點頭，不同意的時候，就搖搖腦袋。這「同意」與「不同意」的裏面，又以不同意的具多。因為石玉樓相當固執，他要怎樣，翁二太在便怎樣，翁二太太只有順着他。而翁二太太要怎樣，石玉樓就不見得順着她。石玉樓在心裏對翁二太太有了個成見，也許是她對一切女人都有這樣一個成見吧！他認為翁二太太當初之所以折磨翁老爺，就為了翁老爺平時太順着她。如今，他絕不願步翁老爺的後塵，因此，他處處拿翁老爺的過去警惕着自己。自然，他也有討翁二太太喜悅的地方，不似翁老爺只能使她厭惡。譬如石玉樓的藝術，石玉樓的年青，以及石玉樓的外表—也正為了這些，翁二太太才甘于忍受了石玉樓所給予她的不快。况且翁二太太這不過是圓復了她的本性，她的本性就是懦弱的。</p>
<p>當翁二太太知道翁老爺的死訊，她曾悄悄灑過幾滴哀悼之淚。她想到翁老爺的自殺是為了她，她難過！她懺悔！但她繼而一想，如果她不出走，她守着翁老爺就那樣陰沉沉地混下去，也不是一個下塲。于是她又原諒了自己。這問題使她矛盾得痛苦！而這痛苦是只有埋藏在心裏，她不能表示，也無人可訴！就在這個期間，她想到墨太太，她記得十年前，她被翁老爺遺棄在荆州，那個最痛苦的時期，便是墨太太救了她，墨太太敎她堅强了起來。後來翁老爺向她投降了，又是墨太太告訴她如何向翁老爺報復。如今，如今仿佛石玉樓在為翁老爺向她報復了，而且，她憂懼着石玉樓會也像翁熬夜似的有一天也遺棄她。因此她茫然的很！她需要墨太太再支持她，同時，生活上她也依然需要墨太太伴她的寂寞。所以，她寫信約墨太太到北京來。</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi Expresses Opinions in Beijing: Peaceful Prospects Remain Optimistic; Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group to Reconvene Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The armistice negotiations inside and outside Shanhaiguan are difficult to realize in the short term, due to the passage of time and shifting conditions. Some people who are eager for peace and unity are racking their brains, using a helpless analysis, forcing an explanation, emphasizing that "military mediation" and "political consultation" cannot be confused. Today, Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, publicly expressed this opinion. Shao stated that currently only large-scale warfare is occurring in the Northeast, with minor conflicts inside Shanhaiguan, and the situation is not serious, so the prospects for mediation remain optimistic. Shao also said: Some news reports in the current newspapers about the conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are unduly exaggerated, which increases public anxiety. The past "Hubei Central Conflict" and the current "Northern Jiangsu War" are examples of this.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] According to Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, who told our reporter, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group meeting may be held at any time. The central task of the meeting is to discuss the number of National Assembly representatives, government reorganization, and the review of the draft constitution. The group meeting has not yet received new proposals from all parties. Furthermore, the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Li Weihan, and the government representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie have all arrived in Beijing. The representatives of the Democratic League, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Liang Shuming, the representatives of the Youth Party, Zeng Qi and Chen Qitian, and the social dignitaries Shao Congen and Wang Yunwu, will all gather in Beijing before the 20th. Wang Yunwu does not intend to attend the group meeting after taking office as Minister of Economic Affairs, and will choose another worthy person to replace him. The residence of the Democratic League representatives is currently under construction and will be completed within a few days. According to Lei Zhen, the Comprehensive Group meeting cannot be convened this week, but it will definitely be held next week.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] It is widely rumored that Sichuan Chairman Zhang Qun will fly to Beijing, but he had not arrived on the 16th. The CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan and their entourage arrived in Beijing by air from Chongqing at 2:00 PM today, accompanied by Liu Ningyi, a member of the "Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions" of the CCP, and five other staff members.</p>
<p>Marshall's "Unity" Plan May Soon Be Realized</p>
<p>[All Nations Service, Washington, 15th] Official sources stated today that the opportunity for China to restore peace is now "brighter" than it was two weeks ago. It is widely believed that General Marshall's "eighteen-month plan" to unite the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has nearly completed its initial six months of work as scheduled. These people believe that although the messages from China do not indicate that friction has decreased, some basic and unpublished improvements have been achieved. Peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in North China and Northeast China may soon be realized. These people refused to disclose the actual gains, only saying that the official reports received by the United States from China show "genuine progress." The above-mentioned people explained General Marshall's "eighteen-month plan," saying that Marshall hopes to achieve a complete ceasefire in the first six months, and this period is now coming to an end. In the second six months, Marshall plans to merge the Kuomintang and Communist forces into a unified military organization. Although the overall command will be taken by Kuomintang generals, the Communist Party can also serve as division commanders. In this unified army, the ratio of Kuomintang to Communist forces is roughly five to one. As for the details, it depends on the local conditions. In the third six months, Marshall hopes to unify and expand China's administrative agencies, even reaching the smallest villages. In various political organizations, the proportion of Kuomintang and Communist personnel differs more significantly than in the military, but the main body still belongs to the central government. U.S. officials believe that the different conditions in various parts of China make this flexible plan the only way to achieve success.</p>
<h3>U.S. Appeasement Policy in China May Reap Its Own Bitter Fruit; Powell on the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] J.B. Powell, editor of the "China Weekly Review," wrote to the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" today, stating that news from the Far East shows that our country's appeasement plan in China is not only failing, but also may reap its own bitter fruit day by day. He pointed out that American journalists who recently lost their freedom in Changchun were surprised by the rapid entry of the Communist army into Northeast China, because there were almost no Communist troops in the Northeast when Japan surrendered. Powell quoted these journalists as saying: The Communist army's occupation work closely cooperated with the U.S. military's retreat, and also said that Inner Mongolia seems to be falling into the hands of the new Soviet Communist regime and becoming another puppet regime of the Soviet Union in Asia. He believes that the expansion of the Communist army's power now proves the views expressed by government officials during the war, that the Communist Party is working harder to improve its own position than to resist the Japanese army. Powell said: "The future is not optimistic. A Communist-controlled China cannot be friendly to the United States, but on the other hand, if a civil war breaks out, it will make the entire revitalization plan a bubble."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th, United Press] American writer William Henry Chamberlin wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal stating that the traditional American policy wishes to see China undivided, and the Open Door Policy should be strictly observed. The current situation in Northeast China is extremely important, and the current division of Korea should be ended. The division of a country always leads to unnecessary poverty and suffering.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan to Add Two Ministries; Weng Wenhao and Zhang Jia'ao to Head Agriculture &amp; Mining and Industry &amp; Commerce, Respectively; Mayors of Beijing and Chiefs of Police of Shanghai to Remain in Office</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The Supreme National Defense Council has decided that Bai Chongxi will be the Minister of National Defense, and Chen Cheng will be the Chief of Staff. However, the members of the Strategic Advisory Committee must be determined after the Ministry of National Defense is established. It is heard that the Executive Yuan plans to add two ministries, Agriculture &amp; Mining and Industry &amp; Commerce, which will be headed by Weng Wenhao and Zhang Jia'ao, respectively. Although Wang Yunwu once humbly declined the post of Minister of Economic Affairs, he will accept the difficult task on June 1 due to the high expectations from all parties. Furthermore, the rumor of changing the Mayor of Beijing has become a thing of the past, and Xuan Tiewu will continue to work hard as the Chief of Police of Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The various Yuan and Ministries of the National Government are finally returning to the capital. Among them, except for the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who have all returned to the capital, the rest of the Yuan and Ministries still have a part remaining in the provisional capital, about 2,000 people, waiting for transportation to come to Beijing. For example, only more than 30 people have arrived at the Ministry of the Interior so far.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] The National Salvation Daily reported that Dong Lifu, Minister of Organization, may be appointed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Lu Zhonglin, the former Director of the Conscription Department, is said to be appointed as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu to Go to Beijing Next Week; Going to Work, Not to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Yunwu, the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, at his private residence. Mr. Wang is the only self-made entrepreneur in our country, and also the only new figure participating in the central organization without any party affiliation. His hair is already white, but his physical strength and spirit are no less than those of a young man. Yesterday, he wore a dark blue Zhongshan suit and deep yellow leather shoes with patches in his simple and plain study and met with reporters. He began by saying: Until yesterday morning, I still hoped to be spared this new appointment, but since the Executive Yuan has already announced it, I should naturally fulfill my national duty. Although I am almost 60 years old, I have not yet reached the age limit for conscription. At the time of political restoration, the country needs me, and I should naturally work hard for the country. Therefore, when Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek sought my consent to take office as Minister of Economic Affairs in Beijing, I stated that I am not here to take office, but to work, and I must be absolutely responsible for my work. However, although I have been engaged in industry in the past, I have focused on cultural aspects and lack economic experience, so I still need to learn. I will first visit various experts, relevant parties, and people's representatives to consult and study within a few days, and I plan to go to Beijing next week to take office. When asked by reporters whether there would be any changes in the personnel of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he highly praised the British civil service protection system. My appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs will be based on the principle of not changing personnel. Moreover, the staff of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are all professional talents. Mr. Weng Wenhao's morality and writing are also admired, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs under Mr. Weng's leadership is naturally well-organized and does not need any changes. Regarding the future of China's economy, he said: "It depends on human effort." Economic warfare is not more difficult than military warfare. As long as the whole country is of one heart and one mind, there will be a way for the future of the economy. Regarding the CCP issue, he hopes to have a reasonable and proper solution. Mr. Wang is a representative of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group. When reporters asked when the group could meet in Nanjing, he said that the group representatives have now arrived in Beijing and Shanghai, and all parties hope to convene the meeting as soon as possible to resolve various issues, but the date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Finally, he said: I have resigned from the position of General Manager of the Commercial Press and planned to engage in literary research and writing, but now I have to temporarily abandon this plan.</p>
<h3>Pauley to Come to Beijing; Compensation Matters May Be Decided Within Weeks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is learned that President Truman's compensation problem advisor Edwin Pauley may come to Beijing from Korea around the 16th. It is also heard that the U.S. side will have a detailed decision within weeks on which Japanese factories should be retained and which should be used for compensation.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Fly to Beijing; Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek Also Returns on the Same Plane</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife arrived in Beijing by plane from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 16th. They got off the plane at 4:13 PM. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek also returned to Beijing on the same plane. When Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek got off the plane, her expression was very happy. Reporters asked those around her about Mrs. Marshall's condition. They said that Mrs. Marshall had no symptoms of illness. Mrs. Marshall said that she was very happy to have this short trip. The Marshalls left the airport at 4:15 PM. When the car arrived at Zhonghua Gate, it happened that President Chiang was driving by. He immediately stopped the car, greeted each other, and then went to the residence together to rest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Five-Star General Special Envoy Marshall came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to visit his wife's condition. He stayed in Shanghai for less than 30 hours and hurriedly took his wife, who had been with him for decades, back to Nanjing by plane at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The U.S. military did not disclose what special mission Marshall had on this trip, but said that he came specifically to pick up his wife and return to Beijing. Marshal Marshall has two sons and one daughter. His eldest son died in Europe during the war. Mrs. Marshall is still grieving and came to China with her husband in March this year. Her health has not improved and she is still recuperating.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Military Defense; Northeast Divided into Five Pacification Zones; Armistice Issue Has Not Yet Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] A reporter recently visited a senior official and asked about the key to the overall situation. According to reports, the safety of the overall situation only depends on the word "sincerity." Currently, the Chinese people are generally disappointed with the CCP's lack of "sincerity," but the government is still expecting with the greatest patience and determination. The crux of the problem is not the new plan or the old plan. This can be seen in the recent remarks of the CCP representatives. The period of depression has not yet passed.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 15th] General Gillem returned to Beiping on the afternoon of the 15th. At the airport, he told Cai Wenzhi and Luo Ruiqing, who greeted him, that his trip to Nanjing had resulted in an agreement on mediation work, but he did not explicitly state whether this agreement was the new military mediation method that was rumored to be passed as long as both parties agreed. Gillem also said that the most important Northeast armistice issue has not yet been resolved, but with Marshall's mediation, President Chiang has directly participated in the Northeast issue negotiations since the 11th, and Gillem was also present at these talks. It is also learned that Gillem's trip not only reached an agreement on the Central Plains issue and temporarily settled this "serious situation," but also provided considerable assistance to the negotiation on resolving the Northeast issue. After all, he is the direct person in charge of the mediation for several months. If the rumored new mediation method is true, it is probably a new method to deal with the current difficult problems based on his experience in mediation for several months.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 15th] A reporter recently asked Luo Ruiqing, the Communist Party's Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, a question, saying that he received a telegram from Beijing saying that the Northeast armistice might be signed tonight. Luo said he had not heard Gillem say this. Regarding the rumored new mediation method that can be passed as long as Nanjing agrees, Luo also said that Gillem only said that there was an agreement, but did not explicitly say that it was an agreement like the rumor. Luo expressed doubt about this rumor.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 15th] A powerful figure in the CCP told reporters that before the Northeast armistice, it cannot be expected that the situation of traffic disruption in various places will improve. The situation will gradually deteriorate. He did not deny that there will be a major battle in Gongzhuling. Some people are quite worried about whether the entire trend in the Northeast and even inside Shanhaiguan will change by waiting for the Changchun issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th] The government side of the Executive Headquarters recently dispatched Major General Liu Jianyi and Major General Xia Jiafu as the leaders of the 28th and 29th groups in the Northeast. They flew to Shenyang on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 16th] The New Life Daily reported that General Du Yuming has ordered the Northeast to be divided into five pacification zones to strengthen military defense, with one pacification director for each zone. Mou Tingfang, commander of the 94th Army, recently arrived here from Shenyang. He said that Sipingjie can be completely recovered within days. However, according to Communist sources, the Communist army is in an advantageous position in the Sipingjie battle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 16th] According to sources in Du Yuming's headquarters, in the past 24 hours, the National Army has extended its control area along the railway lines from Shenyang to various places. There are various signs in Shenyang that the National Army is consolidating its base and will launch a large-scale general offensive towards Sipingjie and Changchun in the coming weeks after driving the Communist army out of the traffic line area. Yesterday, the National Army began to attack 30,000 to 40,000 Communist troops concentrated on the east side of the railway line between Shenyang and Sipingjie, driving them 40 li to the east.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] A senior Communist official in Shenyang revealed that Lu Chengcao (transliteration) of Zhang Xueliang's former command is now commanding the Communist army's defense in Sipingjie. He also said that Lu is not a member of the Communist Party. In 1937, he was an officer in the 53rd Northeast Army. Before the Xi'an Incident, the army was personally led by Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] According to reports, fierce battles are taking place in Chifeng, Rehe, and Xifengkou of the Great Wall. The Communist army intends to advance towards Liaoning.</p>
<h3>Executive Teams Work; No Hindrance or Obstruction; Gillem Obtains Agreement in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th] It is confirmed that it is not as rumored outside, but an agreement limited to the actions of the Executive Teams. The main points of the agreement are divided into two: (1) No unit or organization of any party may hinder or obstruct the actions of the Executive Teams. (2) If any party of the Executive Team proposes to go to a certain place for investigation, mediation, or other matters, it can be established with the consent of the other party. No single party has the right to veto. However, this new method does not apply to the Executive Teams' discussion of specific issues, nor does it apply to the Executive Headquarters or the Three-Person Team above it, but is limited to deciding on the actions of the Executive Teams. In the past, the actions of the Executive Teams were hindered or obstructed by the local units under the pretext of not reaching the orders of the superiors. Also, when a party proposed that the Executive Team must go to a certain place for inspection or mediation, if a certain party felt that it was unfavorable to them, they would veto it by objecting, which hindered the solution of many problems.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th] After Gillem and Hill arrived in Beijing, they made suggestions on accelerating the efficiency of the Executive Headquarters and Executive Teams' mediation work. Later, the Military Affairs Three-Person Team discussed and obtained improved methods and universally signed instruction documents, which were issued to the Executive Headquarters. The main contents included (1) Stipulating that Executive Teams should have equal opportunities to investigate the government and the CCP, and the U.S. representative of the Executive Team can propose a draft investigation procedure, which will be executed after the three parties agree. If it is difficult to reach an agreement, it can be submitted to the Executive Headquarters for resolution within 24 hours. (2) For those who request Executive Teams to investigate with false information, the Three-Person Team can take effective sanctions. (3) Local authorities should protect and assist the work of the Executive Teams and should not hinder or delay the actions of the Executive Teams.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Destroys Beining and Jinpu Railways</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th] It has been learned here that the Communist army has recently destroyed the railway as follows: (1) The Beining Railway can run to Qiansuo. The situation east of Qiansuo is unknown. It is speculated that Gaoling has been occupied by the Communist army. The Communist army in that area is ten times larger than the National Army. It is heard that a part of the National Army is completely surrounded by the Communist army. The Communist army east of Qiansuo is destroying it on a large scale. The rails have been transported away. The Jinyu Line cannot pass through in recent days. (3) There are no battles south of Cang County on the Jinpu Line today, but Botou and Fengjiakou are still in the hands of the Communist army. A big fire broke out in the Zha River from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM yesterday, destroying many houses. The Communist army is transporting troops south of the Zha River on small trains. (3) At Zhu Nan Zhuang, six miles north of Beicang in the Pingjin section, more than 3,000 Communist troops launched a surprise attack at 12:00 last night. After the National Army met them, they retreated at 5:00 AM this morning. In Tanggezhuang, southwest of Huangcun, the Communist army recruited 4,000 laborers to prepare to destroy the road. On the other hand, the National Army recovered Anci County at 5:00 AM this morning. A big fire broke out when the Communist army retreated.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Completely Withdraws from Northeast China; Commander Dong Chanping Has Received Official Notice; Inquiries from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Have Not Yet Been Answered</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Liu today stated that Dong Chanping, the head of the military delegation stationed in Vladivostok with the Soviet army, has received official notice from the Soviet side stating that the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from the Northeast, and Dalian, as one of the ports in the Northeast, is also included in the withdrawal. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously officially inquired of Moscow whether the Soviet army had completely withdrawn, and has not yet received a reply. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union can use Lushun as a military base. It is estimated that the Soviet army in that area has not withdrawn. Or, in response to the saying that the Soviet diplomatic and railway personnel have all withdrawn due to the unstable military situation in the Northeast, Liu said that the National Government recently agreed to set up a Soviet consulate in Shenyang, but no Soviet consuls have yet arrived in various parts of the Northeast. If there were Soviet diplomats in the Northeast ten days ago, they must have been representatives previously sent by the Soviet Union to the Puppet Manchukuo. As for the withdrawal of railway personnel, the Soviet Embassy has notified the National Government that the reason is "lack of protection." The National Government replied that Chinese personnel on the Changchun Railway have been ordered to remain in their posts and work, and hoped that the Soviet side would do the same.</p>
<h3>Shenyang and Shanghai Prepare for Direct Telephone and Telegraph Communications</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th] The Northeast Electric Administration is actively strengthening itself. The Office of the Northeast District Telecommunications Traffic Receiving Committee will soon be abolished and the Ninth District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications will be established. It is also actively preparing for direct telegraph and telephone communications between Shenyang and Shanghai and Nanjing. The person in charge of Northeast Electric Administration in Ping had purchased a large number of telecommunications materials and borrowed a 5,000-kilowatt station line and a telephone and telegraph machine from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau.</p>
<h3>Zeng Shucheng Succeeds as Mayor of Kunming</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] Chen Yuke, the mayor of Kunming, resigned from his position as mayor with reference to a National Assembly representative in the Pacification District and has been approved. The newly appointed mayor Zeng Shucheng took office at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Yuhang Robbed Again; Losses Exceed Ten Million</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 16th] This morning, a passenger car from Hangzhou to Yuhang was robbed by seven bandits about three li from Liuxia near Hangzhou, injuring the driver with a gun. Passengers lost 15 million.</p>
<h3>General Bai Chongxi Arrives in Beiping; Will Go to Northeast China Today for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] General Bai Chongxi flew to Beiping on the morning of the 16th to turn to Manchuria. It is heard that this trip is to inspect the situation in the Northeast and the reorganization of the Northeast troops. Furthermore, General Sun Liren, who attended the United Nations Staff Conference, came to Beijing from Shanghai today. It is heard that after Sun met with President Chiang to report on his duties, he may turn to Manchuria to inspect and take the opportunity to comfort the comrades of the New First Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] Bai Chongxi flew to Beiping at 2:00 PM on the 16th and will fly to Manchuria on the 17th for inspection.</p>
<h3>Current State of Transportation Between Guangdong and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— By Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>General Festing of the British Army visited Guangdong on the 8th on official business. On the 10th, he hosted Guangzhou newspaper reporters and stated: "Guangzhou and Hong Kong are sister cities, and it is essential to understand each other's environments and maintain close contact… Now Hong Kong has transitioned from military to civil administration, but traditional policies will not change, and its friendly relationship with China will also remain unchanged… Currently, the world is experiencing post-war food shortages and social disorder, and Guangdong and Hong Kong are no exception…" General Festing traveled to Guangdong on a British naval speedboat. On the same day he made his remarks, an unprecedented tragedy occurred on the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway line, involving "more than a dozen deaths and injuries and losses of 200 million," shocking the societies of Guangdong and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The light express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway departed from Guangzhou at 7:00 AM on the 10th. As it approached Nangang, more than a dozen bandits suddenly opened fire from the hillside, unleashing a barrage of bullets on the train. Simultaneously, a landmine exploded on the tracks with three loud blasts, instantly shattering the locomotive. The driver and three passengers were killed immediately, while the conductor and nine travelers were seriously injured, and three others sustained minor injuries. The bandits rushed onto the train, demanding valuables from the passengers for about twenty minutes before fleeing.</p>
<p>The greatest loss among the passengers was suffered by a merchant who carried 70 million in national currency. A high-ranking provincial government official, Mr. Liang, also carried 50 million in national currency, and another merchant carried 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, all of which were stolen. According to eyewitness accounts from passengers, the bandits were all dressed in black plain clothes and carried Japanese pistols. One of the bandits produced a card printed with the three characters "Zhu Guang Kang," identifying himself to the passengers as a Red Army soldier and assuring them not to panic.</p>
<p>Nangang, the site of the incident, is strategically located in the Dongjiang area. Twenty years ago, it was a gathering place for Dongjiang outlaws. It is now considered a haven for communist guerrillas calling themselves the "Dongjiang Detachment," located about 23 kilometers from Guangzhou. The nearby hillside where the incident occurred originally had a fort, but it is said that the garrison was being changed that day. The old troops had left, and the new troops had not yet arrived, creating an opportunity for the tragedy.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was quite safe before the war. After this incident, the Guangdong provincial authorities are taking it very seriously and are currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is rumored that a system of joint defense, joint guarantee, and collective responsibility will be implemented to maintain transportation and protect the safety of passengers. Starting from the 12th, additional soldiers armed with live ammunition have been dispatched to patrol critical points along the railway line. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is the most important nerve center for transportation in Southern China, and ensuring the safety of its operations is essential. Although the land distance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is only 112 miles, if transportation between the two places is interrupted, foreign goods cannot be imported, and local products cannot be exported, making them like two unconnected planets. In addition to the railway, there are also ships for transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong. However, before the war, the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train ran two times daily, and the demand remained high. The train journey only took three hours, while the ship journey took at least six and a half hours. Therefore, many passengers chose to travel by land. In case of emergencies, it was possible to make a round trip within a day. After the war, due to coal shortages, damaged tracks, and outdated locomotives, the travel time has doubled compared to before the war. It now takes at least eight hours. The shipping service was restored not long ago, but there is a lack of vessels, and the schedule has been reduced, with an average of only one ship every two days. The railway bureau initially planned to imitate the pre-war method and add one train daily, but there are not enough carriages and locomotives, making it impossible to proceed. Unable to do anything else, they came up with a type of light express train. This type of train has two carriages and two locomotives. The locomotives are converted from car engines, using gasoline as fuel, and each can carry 9 to 12 passengers. The train involved in the incident carried 41 passengers, including five female passengers.</p>
<p>The light express train takes about five hours for the entire journey, which is still slower than the special express train before the war. The fare is about twice as high as the special express train, but many passengers choose it to save time. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred in less than a month of operation! As Southern China recovers, transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon line is becoming more frequent every day and will not be affected by this tragedy. On the contrary, this tragedy has strengthened the authorities' determination to improve transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon line and made people in the country newly aware of the importance of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway connects to the Yuehan Railway. With active repairs by the authorities, the Yuehan Railway will be fully operational within half a year, connecting Southern and Central China. The significant role that the Yuehan Railway played during the War of Resistance is expected to have even more glorious performance during the recovery period. Not to mention the distant future, Hunan is currently suffering from famine, but due to transportation issues, tens of thousands of tons of food from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are stuck in the warehouses of Hong Kong, unable to be transported for relief. The UNRRA has also recently shipped a large number of railway equipment and carriages to assist in the restoration of the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>To strengthen transportation in Southern China, the authorities allocated a large sum of money two months ago to begin repairing the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway. The section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway from Kowloon to Shenzhen, the border between China and Britain, was undamaged when the Japanese surrendered. However, the section from Shenzhen to Guangzhou was damaged by the Japanese first and then by the communists. Now, the authorities are collecting road materials from all sources, gathering specialized technicians, and accelerating repairs. It is said that the entire road will be open to traffic by June 10th. At that time, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will be "as if a tiger has grown wings," and transportation in Southern China will have a leap forward. Air transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has also been quite smooth since the border opened, with the entire journey taking only 45 minutes. (May 13th)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] As the Korean Restoration Army is about to demobilize and return to its home country, the General Headquarters hosted a press conference this afternoon to express its farewell. General Commander Li Qing Tian presided, reported on the current political situation in Korea, and released a demobilization declaration. According to Li, Korea is currently facing famine. Although Korea produces rice, the northern part of the country, under Soviet military control, cannot transport rice to the south, which is under U.S. control. Before the Japanese surrender, all Korean currency amounted to only 140 billion won. After the U.S. and Soviet forces took over, the U.S. issued 400 billion won, and the Soviet Union issued tens of billions, totaling about 1 trillion won. The army was established in Chongqing in 1940. It coordinated with the First, Second, Third, Fifth War Zones of China and the Allied forces in South Myanmar and India to fight against Japan. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is about to retire and return to its home country. The army currently has a total of 1,100 soldiers stationed in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places, waiting to return to their country by ship. The Korean government is still led by the provisional government formed by Kim Gu, with U.S. guidance, while the Soviet-occupied areas have established a People's Committee. Their current hope is for people's stable living conditions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] General Commander of the Korean Restoration Army, Li Qing Tian, hosted a press conference at Anle Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 16th to announce that the army would demobilize from now on, and all personnel would return to Korea to participate in construction projects. The army has been established for seven years, and according to Li, its development has been as follows: "The predecessor of our army was the National Defense Revolutionary Army within the country, the Great Korean West Route Army Political Department in the Northeast, the North Route Army Political Department, the Korean Independence Army, the Koryo Revolutionary Army, the Sino-Korean Allied Army, and the Sino-Korean Joint Punitive Army. In 1940, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, our army was recognized by the government of your country, and a new army was organized with support. It was formally established in Chongqing. Now that the enemy has surrendered and Korea has been restored, our army's mission of cooperating in combat within your country has come to an end. We announce our demobilization, and all personnel will return to the country to engage in construction work. Our army is grateful for the deep moral assistance from the wise figures in your country's government and the public for more than 30 years."</p>

<h3>Delays in Wuhan Telegrams; Hope That Transportation Authorities Will Quickly Improve</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Airmail] News telegrams and telegrams sent from Wuhan to Shanghai have often been delayed for more than two days. The Shanghai newspaper's correspondent in Wuhan has repeatedly contacted the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, but there has been no improvement. It is understood that the bureau's express message room for messages sent to Shanghai only has a damaged machine left behind by the enemy, and due to performance reasons, only Japanese employees can repair it, so it is impossible to work whenever it is damaged. Although the bureau's telegraphers intend to find ways to strengthen it, they are filled with the sentiment that they "cannot do anything" due to the failure of the machines. It is generally believed that Wuhan has a population of nearly one million, but the telecommunications equipment is so simple. It is hoped that the transportation authorities will make long-term improvements.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Invading Changchun Are Mostly Bandits and Puppets; This Is What Is Meant by the "Democratic Allied Army"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Since last October until the fall of Changchun, I have worked in Changchun for half a year, and I would like to point out the following facts to the people of the country. Zhou Baozhong, who commanded the invasion, was appointed by the CCP as the "Commander of the Jilin-Liaoning Military Region" and is now also the Garrison Commander of Changchun. He was the "Lieutenant Colonel Huang" who was active in Changchun between October 11th and 12th of last year. After the national government officially took over Changchun on December 22nd, this "Lieutenant Colonel Huang" withdrew from Changchun. On December 27th, under the title of "General Zhou Baozhong," he used cars to forcibly transport gentry from five or six counties around Changchun to hold a "Jilin Provincial People's Representative Conference" in Chaluhe, 120 miles south of Jilin. As a result, "General Zhou Baozhong" was "elected" to become "Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government." In that representative conference, Zhou Jingwen, who was in Chongqing, was also elected as vice chairman. Zhang Qinghe, the deputy commander of this attack on Changchun, was the director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau in early November. The first retreat of the receiver personnel on November 17th was caused by the threats and harassment of this "Director" Zhang. When Mayor Zhao Junmai received the transfer, he was ordered to lead troops to withdraw from Changchun and had been wandering around the Nongan-Dehui area for several months. This time he has returned as the deputy commander of the invasion. He is a puppet Manchukuo officer. When I was in Changchun, I saw in a Japanese magazine that he gave a speech at a "National Warriors' Symposium" in 1943, but now he has been cited as a cadre of the "Democratic Generals." The "Mayor" of the communist troops in Changchun City is also Liu Juying, who continued to act as "Mayor" for sixteen days after succeeding Yuan on November of last year, before being forced to withdraw under pressure from our government. Since January of this year, she has served as the "Secretary-General" of "Chairman" Zhou Baozhong, entrenched in the Chaluhe-Panshi area of Jilin, which is a typical area of bandits and puppets in Changchun. It is said that she has relatives with Li Yunchang. The return of the above three figures is merely a reenactment of the situation between October 11th and 12th of last year, except with the addition of Peng Zhen and Lin Feng from Yan'an. "General Zhou Baozhong, ""Mayor" Liu Juying," the puppet Manchukuo "youngster" Zhang Qinghe, plus the likes of Peng Zhen and Lin Feng from Yan'an, the three-in-one has created the current situation in Changchun. This situation has been born since October of last year. This kind of three-in-one form can also explain the essence of the entire Northeast issue. From the figures who are now putting on a performance, we can understand the meaning of the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" and "Autonomous Government." I hope that the people of the country will pay special attention to the Communist Party's unscrupulous approach to seizing territory, which is included in the words "Allied" and "Autonomous."</p>
<h3>CCP Director of the Military Mediation Department Shot at in Car in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 16th] Xinhua News Agency reported that Song Shilun, Director of the CCP Executive Office of the Military Mediation Department, was shot at in a car with the license plate "Guo Zi Yi Ling Ba Si Liu" at 6:45 PM last night on the way from Beixinqiao to Wangfujing. The car window was shattered, but Song was not injured. Today, Ye Jianying personally went to the Beiping Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau to request the arrest of the perpetrator. According to the police bureau personnel who inspected the car, the weapon used to attack the car was likely a Browning pistol.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisoners Drown Near Nanjing After Boat Capsizes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangjian" steamer, carrying over 2,500 Japanese prisoners from Hankou, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 15th. At 3 PM on the 16th, the ship docked at Pier No. 3 to disembark the prisoners. Due to overcrowding on the lighters, over 300 Japanese prisoners went onto a large barge moored alongside the pier to rest. Unexpectedly, the barge capsized due to being overloaded, causing all those onboard to fall into the water. Pier staff, laborers, and military police made every effort to rescue them, saving over 200 people. Nearly a hundred drowned.</p>
<h3>Tainan's Anping Port Renovation Project to be Completed in Five Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] Anping Port in Tainan was originally one of Taiwan's best ports. However, in recent years, silt and sand accumulation have made it difficult for large ships to enter and exit. The Tainan City Government plans to raise NT$100 million to renovate the port and canals, with completion expected in five years. Anping Port was built by the Dutch in 1630. Zheng Chenggong led his troops to attack and enter the port. The "Old Port" is actually Anping Port. The Japanese built the port from 1922 to 1925 and constructed a canal, including docks, cargo yards, warehouses, ice factories, and fish markets. However, silt accumulation recurred, and in 1925, a new port was opened south of the original port, which took three years. It has not been repaired in recent years and is severely damaged. The current plan is to build two breakwaters, each 1,800 meters long, outside the port to accommodate ships of approximately 3,000 tons. The sand and mud dredged from the port will be used to fill the low-lying areas south of the port to create an industrial zone.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Defense is Effective, Mutinous Troops Retreat: More than a hundred mutinous soldiers from the former Wang Bamei unit stationed in Pinghu and Zhapu boarded three ships on the afternoon of the 10th, carrying new-style weapons, intending to cause trouble at the Jinshanzui estuary in the county.

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>American Agricultural Expert Comes to Hangzhou for Observation: American agricultural expert Mr. Homer, hired by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as a consultant to its extension council, was accompanied by technician Yang Maochun of the ministry to inspect agricultural conditions in Hangzhou. He has now completed his work and returned to Beijing via Shanghai to report to the ministry. Mr. Homer is also cooperating with relief organizations such as the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Based on his investigation, he suggested that the relief branch allocate seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, livestock, instruments, medicines, and other supplies according to the needs of each locality to assist in the agricultural reconstruction work in various inland areas. Recently, the United States organized a Chinese agricultural advisory group, and Mr. Homer is also participating as a member.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Training Police and Establishing Supplementary Schools: The county government believes that police chiefs are subordinate cadres of the police force, responsible for directly protecting public order and implementing government orders. Their quality must be continuously improved so that police administration can have a good performance. Most of the current police chiefs in the county were transferred from the puppet regime. Their habits are deeply ingrained, and they are often resistant to government orders. Unless they are strictly trained, it is impossible to talk about rectification. It is proposed to establish a supplementary school for police chiefs and separately recruit and transfer outstanding police officers to provide them with rigorous training. Preparations have already begun, and the budget has been prepared. It will begin as soon as approval is received.</p>
<p>Confiscating Enemy-Occupied Houses Separately: The Suzhou Office of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau stated that Chen Zemin, Gao Guanwu, Yu Bailu, Tang Huimin, and others all have properties in Suzhou that should be confiscated in accordance with national laws.

These included Chen Zemin's house at No. 69 Furenfang, with more than 200 pieces of rosewood furniture; Gao Guanwu's Western-style house at No. 99 Xihai Island; Yu Bailu's Western-style house at No. 9 Qiaoyuan Bridge; and Tang Huimin's house at No. 16 Ruyi Lane, Shiquan Street, with more than 90 pieces of rosewood furniture. All items were counted, registered, and confiscated pending further handling.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>

(5) A large gambling den was raided at the Luochunge teahouse in Fanjiashi outside the Xiaodongmen, and fifteen gamblers were arrested.</p>
<p>County Government to Construct a Ring Road: The ring road of the county, which began construction before the war but has not yet been completed, has been urged by the County Provisional Council to be built by the county government. The county government replied expressing that the construction of the ring road has been listed as a construction project plan of this county. Once the funds are available, construction can begin.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>County Government Prohibits Solicitation of Litigation: Since the restoration of this county, civil and criminal lawsuits have increased. Magistrate Fang specially ordered the district, township, and town offices to establish mediation committees. In the future, if people have civil disputes, they must first apply for mediation. If they truly wish to litigate, the complaint must be accompanied by a certificate proving the mediation was unsuccessful. The complainant must also sign and seal the complaint before it can be accepted. Anyone found colluding in litigation will be severely investigated and punished.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers: The people of this county held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and martyrs of Xiaohai and Guanshui towns the other day. More than fifty units participated. At 9:00 AM, the memorial service began. Chairman Liu, commander of the 105th Division, reported on the combat situation. Wang, deputy commander, Commissioner Xu, Magistrate Yang, Qian Xiaowu, and others then gave speeches. Representatives of various government agencies and units then offered sacrifices.</p>
<p>Wuhu</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Tea Market Slumps: Due to some people recklessly bidding up prices, rice prices in Wuhu have soared from 20,000 to over 40,000 in a week, causing small merchants to hoard and refuse to sell retail, leading to widespread panic among the people and turmoil in the market. A small number of rice merchants with a strong sense of responsibility, seeing that no one from the government was intervening, voluntarily stopped trading with outsiders for three days and agreed to keep the market price within 40,000, which was able to calm the situation for a while. However, speculators learned that rice prices in Guangdong had reached an index of 90,000 to 100,000, and their desire for profit became uncontrollable. They started aggressively buying again, and in the morning and afternoon of the past two days, prices rose sharply by more than 8,000, with milled rice now exceeding 43,000. It has been found that this rice all comes from the sea and is obtained by using the name of the tea company to obtain agricultural loans of 200,000,000 yuan, colluding with prominent figures in Wuhu and relying on their power to obtain huge profits. Although public opinion has repeatedly appealed for the sake of the people, the authorities remain indifferent. As capital is poured into rice, tea, which is Anhui's only foreign trade product, is now in decline at a time when it should be revitalized. The best *taijian* (tea bud) is now only selling for around 300,000 yuan, strip tea for 130,000 to 140,000, and stored tea for 150,000 to 160,000. The position of our world-renowned tea in foreign countries may be completely undermined.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Recent Personnel Changes in the Government</h3>
<p>The Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council held meetings the day before yesterday. In addition to adjusting the organization of the Central Party Headquarters and implementing austerity measures, Peng Xuepei was also selected as the Minister of Propaganda to succeed Wu Guozhen, who was transferred to be the mayor of Shanghai. In addition, military industry expert Yu Dawei was appointed Minister of Transportation, and scientific management expert Wang Yunwu was appointed Minister of Economic Affairs. Both are non-partisan individuals, demonstrating the government's sincerity in broadly soliciting social talents to jointly manage the country. At the same time, the national defense and military organization was adjusted, merging the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Military Administration, the Ministry of Military Training, and the Ministry of Political Affairs into a single Ministry of National Defense, with General Bai Chongxi appointed as the Minister of National Defense and young General Chen Cheng as the Chief of General Staff, officially established on June 1st. This is the first personnel change since the National Government returned to the capital and can also be said to be the first step in the central government's reform of the party, government, and military mechanisms, "enhancing administrative efficiency, rectifying organizations at all levels, clarifying responsibilities, abolishing all redundant organizations, simplifying administrative procedures, and implementing tiered accountability." We hope that the government will start anew with the people, and this initial adjustment by the government is worthy of everyone's attention.</p>
<p>From the perspective of political common sense and examples from various countries, personnel changes and partial reorganizations are common occurrences in politics because the most important thing in politics is policy, not personnel. However, China's current politics has not completely broken away from the stage of "rule by man," and there is often a feeling that "when the person exists, the policy is implemented; when the person dies, the policy ceases." Therefore, the advancement and retreat of people can often affect the rise and fall of events. Does this personnel change in the central government contain the meaning of changing policies, or is it only aimed at enhancing administrative efficiency?</p>
<p>We do not deny that the current Chinese politics is difficult to satisfy people and that there are many areas that urgently need reform. What the people of the whole country are looking forward to is the gradual realization of the "Peaceful Nation-Building Program" passed by the Political Consultative Conference. In other words, it is to reorganize the National Government to accommodate people from all parties and factions to participate, and to convene the National Assembly on May 5th to formulate a constitution to embark on the right track of democratic politics. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is creating wars in the Northeast and launching attacks everywhere within the Great Wall, and it stubbornly holds to its views on the draft constitution and refuses to compromise even slightly. As for the government reorganization and the National Assembly, it refuses to provide a list of nominees, so that the National Assembly, which the people have been eagerly awaiting, has to be postponed again, and the government reorganization has also been blocked. However, the central political authorities urgently need to start anew with the people and strive to revitalize the country and must not continue to procrastinate like this, causing everyone to hold a "five-day mayor" mentality, making government efficiency even lower. Therefore, the central authorities decided to automatically carry out partial reorganization and at the same time recruit social talents to participate in order to strengthen administrative efficiency. We believe that the government's fundamental policy of post-war reconstruction will not be affected by personnel changes. Furthermore, in terms of the candidates succeeding as ministers, Wang Yunwu and Yu Dawei are both non-partisan experts and scholars. Although we oppose the erroneous idea of "those who excel in academics should become officials" in academic and cultural circles, it seems that in today's China, if the government can recruit domestic experts and scholars to participate in the government and hold important positions, it is still something worthy of encouragement. The government not only regards the democratization of politics as the highest principle but has also begun to advance towards this goal. We dare to say that this central personnel change is the first step in China's politics towards democratization. On the other hand, let us take a look at the CCP, which has always flaunted "democracy." Apart from loudly shouting about democracy, what facts of democratization has it shown to the people in politics!</p>
<p>Prior to the central personnel change, the Shanghai Municipal Government was also reorganized. The Executive Yuan's regular meeting appointed Wu Guozhen as the mayor of Shanghai, and the secretary-general of the municipal government, the director of the finance bureau, the director of the health bureau, and the director of the political affairs bureau have also been replaced. The new mayor will soon bring the new directors to Shanghai to take office. This is also the beginning of Shanghai's municipal administration after the war entering a new stage. Shanghai is an international metropolis where Chinese and foreigners live together. In the past, the existence of concessions was regarded as a source of evil. During the War of Resistance, Shanghai first became an isolated island, suffering the oppression of the enemy, and then became an occupied area, directly suffering the destruction and poisoning of the enemy and puppet regimes, almost becoming the darkest place on earth. Last autumn, the Japanese invaders surrendered, the sun and moon shone again, and former Mayor Qian Dajun arrived in Shanghai with the national army and took office as the first mayor of Shanghai after the war. Eight months have passed since then, and it has been difficult to manage. Shanghai's environment is inherently unique, coupled with the inevitable chaos after the war. Qian Dajun has tried his best to reform the municipal administration, but its effectiveness is difficult to achieve overnight. Moreover, what the citizens of Shanghai suffer most today is the high prices and the difficulty of life, and the control of materials and the management of transportation are beyond the power of the local authorities. There is a desire to govern, but the power and responsibility do not belong to the same person, so it is appropriate that he is exhausted and has to leave office. We cannot hastily judge the merits and demerits of the first mayor of Shanghai after the restoration at this moment, but we can at least say that for a local official, if you want him to be responsible, you should first give him the powers that he should have. If he has a position but no authority, all matters, or at least some matters, are subject to the constraints of all parties, then the cautious will have nothing to do, and the reckless will have something to shirk. If this system does not change, we are afraid that changing local officials a hundred times will not help.</p>
<p>Therefore, before the new mayor comes to Shanghai, we would like to ask the central authorities to give the new mayor as much power as he should have. Local politics is the responsibility of the local officials, and the central government's supervision and encouragement are enough to fulfill the duty of promoting the state affairs. It is not necessary for all matters to be directly managed by the central government departments. How to review the past, plan for the future, and grasp the reality to build a post-war Shanghai is the common wish of the four million citizens of Shanghai and also the ambition that the new mayor should have. I remember that before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Municipal Government, although there were concessions at that time and the area it governed was limited, had a consistent plan to build an ideal Shanghai. Although this ideal could not be fully realized due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the spirit of governing and the style of not easily changing personnel at that time are still praised by the citizens. Therefore, I still hope that the new mayor, within the scope of his powers and responsibilities, will carry forward the policies and spirit of the municipal government before the war, build a great Shanghai, and especially hope that the central government will first give him power and then hold him accountable.</p>
<p>In addition, China's politics has not yet implemented a civil service system, and often due to the change of the head, even the clerks and staff are often transferred in large numbers. Wang Yunwu said yesterday that he would not easily change personnel after he arrived at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is commendable. It is already hard enough to be a civil servant, and they still have to "walk through the doors of the dukes and ministers, serving at the side of the powerful and noble," floating with the political tides, which is not only uneconomical for his personal economy, but also uneconomical for society and the country. In this way, administration can never get on the right track. In short, we hope that both the central and Shanghai municipal governments will change their personnel and work together to create a new situation!</p>

<h3>British Government Announces Indian Federal Organization Outline in the House of Commons: Establishment of Provisional Government at the Full Discretion of the Governor-General of India; Cabinet Delegation to Leave India and Return to London at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 16th, Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee announced this afternoon at 2:00 PM (Greenwich Time) in the House of Commons the Indian Federal Plan, which contains six major outlines. This plan was drafted by the three-member British Cabinet delegation visiting India because negotiations between Indian leaders on the Indian Independence and Provisional Government Plan have failed during the drafting period of the new constitution. The so-called six major outlines are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish an Indian Federation, including so-called British India and India's six hundred tribes. (2) Establish a central administrative department and legislative assembly. Any major issue must be approved by the majority of the legislative assembly and the National Congress Party and the Muslim League before it can be passed. (3) Other government issues (remaining issues) may be handled by the provinces. (4) Tribes also maintain all their powers and do not transfer them to the federation. (5) Provinces may establish districts, and districts may also establish administrative departments and legislative assemblies. (6) In the federal and district constitutions, it is stipulated that any provincial legislative assembly may reconsider the constitution by voting after the first ten years and every ten years thereafter.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Delegation also proposed the establishment of a transitional government, with all departments handled by Indians.</p>
<p>Further News: Attlee admitted in the House of Commons that the British delegation's efforts in India had completely failed. He said that Gandhi's response to the British side was only two words: "Quit India." Gandhi also incited Indians to riot in various places, but it has been quelled.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 16th, Broadcast: The British Cabinet Delegation decided to leave India and return to London before the end of the month. All matters related to the organization of the provisional government will be handled at the full discretion of the Governor-General of India, Wavell.</p>
<p>Harmonizing the Demands of Both Factions and Considering the Interests of All States</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] India is now awaiting the announcement of the British Cabinet Mission's recommendations on Indian independence. Lord Lawrence will make a fifteen-minute broadcast simultaneously in London and New Delhi after the publication of the communiqué, and will then convene a press conference with Cripps and Alexander. Another press conference will be held the following day. Governor-General Wavell will also make a fifteen-minute broadcast on Friday night. The Cabinet Delegation may convene representatives of the Indian National Congress Party and the Muslim League today to discuss their recommendations. Former Congress Party Chairman Acharya, current Chairman Nehru, and Gandhi have all been invited to attend. Muslim League Chairman Jinnah has not come forward since the breakdown of the Shimla Summit Conference, so his secretary Ali Khan will attend. The British Cabinet representatives have kept the recommendations secret before their official announcement. The Cabinet representatives have presented long-term recommendations. Prior consideration has been given to the minimum requirements of the two factions in India and the interests of the various Indian states. It is generally expected that these recommendations will not differ too much from the principles previously announced by the Cabinet.</p>
<h3>Breaking the Political Stalemate in Japan: Shigeru Yoshida Appointed to Form a Cabinet; Gathering Talents, the New Cabinet Has a Conservative Nature</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Tokyo, 16th - Radio broadcast: At 2:45 PM today, the Emperor ordered Yoshida to organize a new cabinet to address various post-war issues. The political stalemate that had persisted for 24 days since Shidehara's resignation has finally been broken. After leaving his high school post, Mr. Yoshida immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to consider and finalize the members of the new cabinet, and issued a statement saying that the Emperor emphasized the urgent need to resolve issues such as food supply. He pledged to complete the cabinet formation swiftly. He also stated that he would seek out ordinary talents to overcome difficulties and achieve national unity. The cabinet formation work is currently being carried out rapidly with State Minister Ishiguro acting as advisor, and Jiyuto (Liberal Party) member Etsujiro Uehara and Shidehara, the leader of the Shinpoto (Progressive Party), serving as consultants.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] Observers in political circles here believe that the Yoshida cabinet will have a conservative nature. Liberal Party members will occupy the majority of positions, with Progressive Party members holding fewer. It is even possible that some members of the Cooperative Party will be included. While not extreme right-wing, these parties are at least right-leaning, with "popular governance" as their slogan. The Yoshida cabinet will exclude members of the Socialist Party or the Communist Party, and these two parties have already decided to form an opposition party.</p>
<p>Cabinet Member Candidates</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 16th] It is reported that the preliminary list of cabinet member candidates is roughly as follows: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Shigeru Yoshida (Liberal Party). Home Minister: Giichi Matsumura (House of Peers). Finance Minister: Aiyama (Liberal Party) or Kotari Toku (same). Justice Minister: (Incumbent) Tomizo Iwata (House of Peers). Education Minister: (Incumbent) Yoshinari Yasunobu (House of Peers). Agriculture and Forestry Minister: Yoshinari Kawai (Progressive Party). Commerce and Industry Minister: Niro Hoshijima (Liberal Party). Health and Welfare Minister: Ryujiro Okubo (Liberal Party). Communications Minister: Kankichi Hitotsumatsu (Progressive Party). State Ministers: Kijuro Shidehara (Progressive Party). Takao Saito (Progressive Party). Etsujiro Uehara (Liberal Party). Takeshige Ishiguro. In addition, it is rumored that due to constitutional considerations, either the renowned scholar Tatsukichi Minobe or the Liberal Party's Tokujiro Kinmochi may also be appointed.</p>
<p>The Yoshida cabinet will inevitably be a short-lived one, its mission being solely to pass the draft constitution in parliament. The Communist Party criticizes Yoshida for appointing Tanaka, the former Foreign Vice-Minister, who contributed to Tanaka's policy of aggression against China. They point out that Yoshida, since his appointment as ambassador to the UK in 1930, supported the aggressive foreign policy towards China and, like the former leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama, should be dismissed.</p>
<p>Yoshida's Brief History</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha News] Japan's new Prime Minister, Yoshida, is 69 years old this year, born in Tosa, Shikoku, of commoner origin. He graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University's Faculty of Political Science in 1906, passed the diplomatic service examination, and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1920, he was appointed as a member of the Committee for Implementing the Treaty of Peace with Germany. In 1928, he served as Foreign Vice-Minister in the Tanaka cabinet. Yoshida's British gentleman-style diplomatic skills gradually gained recognition at this time. In 1930, he was appointed as plenipotentiary ambassador to Italy. In 1932, he was a Japanese representative to the Lausanne Reparations Conference. In 1936, he was appointed as ambassador to the UK. In 1939, he was dismissed and remained out of office for six years. After Japan's surrender, in September, he became Foreign Minister and concurrently President of the "Bureau for Handling Post-War Affairs," dealing with post-armistice matters. During the war, Yoshida often advocated peace to the Tojo cabinet, which resulted in him "eating the stale rice of the military police" for three months, but he never wavered in his views. When Konoe advised the Emperor to abandon the hopeless war, he also often consulted with Yoshida. Sources here say that while Yoshida is a liberal, he is definitely not a democrat. As Prime Minister, he faces difficult and treacherous prospects, which are far from optimistic.</p>
<p>The Course of Political Turmoil</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tokyo Correspondent, 15th] Since the resignation of the Shidehara cabinet, Japan's political situation has been in a state of confusion. After a lengthy discussion on the issue of forming a cabinet, the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party decided to give the Prime Minister's position to the Liberal Party. However, the Liberal Party must implement the Socialist Party's economic policies in the new cabinet. Therefore, people generally hope to establish a coalition government in Japan. However, the leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama, is an opportunist. For example, during the era of military rule, Hatoyama supported fascism, but after the Allied forces landed, he talked extensively about his democratic theories. When Shidehara dispatched Foreign Minister Yoshida to suggest to MacArthur that Hatoyama be promoted to form a cabinet, MacArthur rejected his suggestion in order to comply with public opinion. Afterwards, Secretary-General Katayama of the Socialist Party was very interested in forming a cabinet, but the conservative parties unanimously expressed their unwillingness to participate in Katayama's new cabinet. The Socialist Party is not a majority party in the parliament. Even with the Communist Party included, it does not reach one hundred seats. If the Socialist Party were to form a cabinet alone, it would certainly not be able to organize one. Since Yoshida took office as the leader of the Liberal Party, and with Shidehara's recommendation, he was appointed to form a cabinet today. A conservative government will be born tomorrow. The opinion of Japanese public opinion believes that the conservative party's emergence to form a cabinet cannot solve the people's main problems, because Yoshida represents Japan's landlords, capitalists, and politicians. Only socialism can solve Japan's current main problems.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Crimes Trials to Take One Year; Hearings Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, United Press] Allied Indian prosecutor Menon stated that the trial of 28 Japanese war crimes suspects will take one year. He stated that the defendant's attacks on the court's jurisdiction were unfounded and only served to delay the trial.</p>

<h3>Japanese Plundered Artifacts Returned to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters has returned the artifacts plundered by the Japanese army in Zhoukoudian, China, to the Chinese delegation in Japan. They will be packed into seven boxes and transported back to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is reported that the Japanese government issued a nationwide order on May 5th and 9th, stating that all materials seized or plundered by the Japanese army through coercive means from China, Vietnam, Siam, Malaya, Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other places occupied by the Japanese army since the "July 7th" Incident, and currently existing in Japan, will be investigated and confiscated by the Japanese government. A deadline of the 20th of this month was set for detailed reporting from all over the country. The Allied Headquarters in Japan further ordered the Japanese government to submit a detailed list of the materials plundered by Japan by June 2nd and to be responsible for their safekeeping, prohibiting the trading or moving of these materials. Cultural relics and materials belonging to our country will be recovered by our country.</p>
<h3>Pacific Islands Base Issue: US-UK Negotiations Underway; UK Maintains Close Cooperation with Various Self-Governing Territories</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Huk, in response to a question from a member of the House of Commons yesterday, stated that the United States had spent a large amount of money during the war establishing military bases on certain islands in the South Pacific region. Some of these islands are under the rule of the British Commonwealth or under its complete governance. In recent months, the US government has made suggestions regarding the future status and use of these islands. Negotiations are still in progress, hoping to establish an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties. The British government maintains the closest cooperation with all self-governing territories on this matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The London "Daily Mail" today used large headlines to urge "The British Empire to Retain Bases," but also mentioned the possibility of Anglo-American joint defense. The "Daily Express" stated that Australia and New Zealand are deeply concerned about the base issue. The "News Chronicle" pointed out that some islands are within the inner defense line of the self-governing territories of the South Pacific. Meanwhile, according to Washington news, the negotiations between the UK and the US on several islands in the Pacific are progressing satisfactorily. Some in Washington speculate that after Admiral Leahy, President Truman's personal Chief of Staff, arrives in London by plane, the possibility of a joint defense agreement between the two countries may be discussed.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Conference: Recess Begins Today; Experts to Discuss German Issues; Date of Peace Conference Still Undecided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 16th - Radio broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has been in session for four weeks now, and from beginning to end, it has been deadlocked. Today, it formally admitted complete failure. On the issue of peace treaties with Italy and other former Axis satellite countries, no agreement could be reached, and it was forced to recess from tomorrow until the 15th of next month, when it will reconvene. At that time, the US will do its best to urge the Soviet Union to agree to determine the date of the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 16th - Radio broadcast: The Foreign Ministers Conference decided this morning to appoint experts to form a special committee to discuss German issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 15th] At the plenary session this afternoon, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference passed the proposal by Byrnes to postpone the current meeting until June 15th. After the postponement, representatives of various countries will continue to work in Paris.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Before the adjournment of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers agreed to sign the draft revision of the Italian armistice conditions proposed by Byrnes, but the date of the peace conference has not been decided.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] The White House announced today that Truman's private plane was not sent to Paris to transport Secretary of State Byrnes and his entourage back to the US, but another plane will fly to Paris tomorrow or the day after to pick up Byrnes for his return home. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, Byrnes's return to the US does not mean that the Foreign Ministers Conference will be postponed. (According to Associated Press, Paris, reliable sources say Byrnes is scheduled to return home on Friday.)</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] Regarding the issue of China's participation in the Foreign Ministers Conference, it is reported that the Four Foreign Ministers have decided that the current discussion of German issues is of a preliminary nature, so they do not intend to invite Chinese representatives to participate. The US side said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had stated that if any one country is invited to participate in the expansion of the meeting, then Poland and Czechoslovakia should also be allowed to attend.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] French Foreign Minister Bidault yesterday elaborated on France's views on the borders of Germany and general issues. British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocated for a broad discussion of the German issue before considering France's Ruhr plan in detail. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov supported Bidault's proposal to discuss Germany's western border first, the content of which is international co-management of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions, while the Saar region would be merged into France. The reason given was that France had encountered seven invasions in the past 150 years, and in order to prevent future invasions, the Ruhr and Rhineland regions should be politically separated from Germany. Bevin expressed his willingness to respect France's security needs, but the German issue needs to be treated as a unit.</p>
<h3>Reason for the Breakdown of US-Soviet Negotiations on Korean Issue; Soviet Newspaper Blames the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] "Izvestia" reported that negotiations on the establishment of a provisional democratic government in Korea have now stalled because of the US representative’s insistence on deviating from the resolutions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. According to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the Allied policy should be to foster democracy in Korea and make it an independent country. Now, the Soviet delegation wants to vigorously implement this resolution, while the US delegation wants to avoid fulfilling some of the resolutions, leading to a standstill in negotiations.</p>
<h3>"Yellow Diplomacy" Incident; US Embassy Official in the Soviet Union Accused of "Rogue Behavior"</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] US Embassy official in the Soviet Union, Walter D. Rose, accused of "rogue behavior," the US has requested the Soviet Union to revoke the charge and allow him to leave the country immediately, which has been rejected. Today, US diplomats here stated that the case has become a diplomatic incident, involving the State Department, the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, and the Kremlin. Soviet Navy Lieutenant Leutin was convicted in the US on March 16th on espionage charges. This indictment against Rose is in retaliation. Two weeks ago, the Soviet Union accused Rose of engaging in "rogue behavior" towards a Soviet female artist in February this year.</p>
<h3>Egypt Opposes International Defense of Suez Canal; British Giant Floating Dockyard Departs from Alexandria</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 15th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sukii recently declared that Egypt should not accept a plan to defend the Suez Canal with international forces. This remark was in response to an opinion expressed by a British newspaper commentator.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Alexandria, 15th] The British Navy's floating dockyard (40,000 tons), which has been used to repair numerous famous warships, set sail today, moving to Gibraltar. It is generally believed that this is a step in Britain's withdrawal of all its land, sea, and air forces from Egypt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 16th] British authorities here recently declared that rumors that orders have been issued for British troops to withdraw from Cairo and Alexandria before July are completely untrue. After investigation, it was found that there are no ships or planes available to transport these troops.</p>

This proposal is expected to be passed by the Council tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Hungary's Alarming Inflation: One US Dollar Worth 2.5 Billion Hungarian Currency; One Ton of Black Market Rice Costs 7.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hungarian Capital, 16th] Hungary is now threatened by inflation, with ten billion Hungarian currency exchanging for one banknote, circulating on the market since May 14th. Before the war, five Hungarian "Pengos" were worth one US dollar, but now one US dollar is worth 2.5 billion Hungarian Pengos.</p>
<p>The average worker earns about one US dollar per month, and a meal on the black market costs three US dollars, but you can't find anyone in the Hungarian capital who truly lives on an income of one US dollar. There are undoubtedly many suffering people in Hungary, but in the theaters, opera houses, and high-end restaurants of the Hungarian capital, there are still many distinguished guests, with no empty seats. Only the traces of the poor are not to be seen.</p>
<p>To such a degree of inflation, the government has yet to announce any measures to stop it. Officials once declared that anyone caught with foreign currency would be punished, but it has had no effect. Most people in the government believe that they should wait until the peace treaty is signed before trying to stop inflation.</p>
<h3>Egyptian King Initiates Call for Arab Heads of State Meeting to Discuss Palestine Issue; Arabs' Opposition to Jewish Immigration is Extremely Determined</h3>

League Secretary-General Ashaim told the press that various Arab kings and presidents will soon meet in a location near Egypt to exchange views on the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] Butairi, an independent member of the Palestine Higher Committee, told our reporter today that if Britain and the US insist on implementing the report of the investigation team, it would be tantamount to war against the Arab race. All Arab countries are willing to support us in opposing expanded immigration. From India to Tripoli, the majority of people want to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations organization for arbitration. Butairi further stated that even if the investigation team's report is implemented, we will never beg for help from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Request to Dissolve the Jewish Agency</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] The Arab Higher Committee resolved to lodge the most serious protest with the British High Commissioner to Palestine, Cunningham, against the illegal immigration of Jews into Palestine, and requested that he immediately dissolve the Jewish Agency that is responsible for this work.</p>
<p>Britain Adopts a Cautious Attitude</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The British Foreign Office issued a statement yesterday stating that the British government is still studying the Palestine report and will not make a decision until after consulting with the US government and consulting the opinions of Arab and Jewish leaders.</p>
<h3>Japan Should Move Towards Democracy, Not Communism: Acheson Warns the Control Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, Exclusive] At today's (15th) meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan, US member and council chairman Acheson stated that the US does not approve of Japan practicing communism. My opinion can be candidly stated that the efforts of the members of this council should be applied to leading Japan towards democratization. Supporting communism or any Japanese political party during public gatherings of the council is not an obligation that any member of this council should have.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Approves Return of Some Japanese Military Equipment</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur today authorized the return of some Japanese military equipment received by the occupation forces for civilian relief, agricultural production, civilian reception, cultural and entertainment activities, or for the manufacture of consumer goods research.

<h3>Two British Carrier Pigeons Awarded Highest Medal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Carrier pigeons "Princess" and "Lonely," who made meritorious contributions during the war, were awarded the British government's "Dickin Medal." This medal is the highest grade among bird medals. "Princess" flew from Crete back to Alexandria in 1943, a distance of more than 500 miles. "Lonely" was dropped from a plane to France in the same year, flying more than 400 miles in one day, setting a record. "Princess" later died of illness in Cairo, while "Lonely" is still alive.</p>
<h3>Goering Planned to Spend a Huge Sum to Purchase the World's Largest Pearl; Stolen by a Thief, Found in France; Perpetrator Captured, Escaped from Prison</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] Belgian named I. Collette, who was arrested by the French police for stealing one of the world's largest pearls, "The Pearl of Asia," escaped from a prison hospital today. Collette feigned madness and was sent to the prison hospital for examination. This prison escape was assisted by accomplices, and the police are currently conducting a reinvestigation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Part of the ownership of the world's largest pearl, "The Pearl of Asia," currently belongs to the Mohideen Brothers Company in Shanghai, Ceylon. In 1944, the pearl was stored in a bank in Paris under the custody of the German army. At that time, Goering planned to offer £165,000 to purchase it. Just as negotiations were underway, Collette and his accomplices, disguised as German police, deceived and stole the pearl. The French police arrested them, but were later released due to German intervention. After the liberation of France, they were arrested again and charged with conspiring with the German secret police. The French police later found the pearl in the toilet of a hotel in Marseille. This largest pearl in the world was first seized by the Persians who invaded Delhi in 1739, and was later presented to the Chinese Emperor, who greatly valued it and used it for burial. It was not until the beginning of this century that it was rediscovered in the hands of a Chinese official. Thirty years ago, a Ceylonese man bought the pearl in Hong Kong for £38,000 and later shared it with a French church. The Ceylonese owner died in Shanghai last year, and part of the ownership was given to his two sons.</p>

<h3>Buying Yarn: Is it Beneficial to Us? Tang Shoumin Still Unenlightened, Actually Claims, "It is the Enemy Giving Us Supplies," and Still Appears Pleased When Confessing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Supreme Court is being extremely active in handling cases of Chinese traitors recently. Yesterday alone, it interrogated as many as fourteen people, and delivered verdicts on two. The details of each case are recorded below:</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday, the presiding judge of the High Court moved to the Second Tribunal to begin hearing the case of Tang Shoumin. Tang refuted each of the offenses listed by Prosecutor Ye in the indictment, even claiming that the prosecutor was prejudiced. Regarding the matter of buying yarn, he cunningly claimed, "Not only was it definitely not supplying the enemy, but it was the enemy giving us supplies." He seemed quite pleased while saying this. Tang is from Zhenjiang, 55 years old, and resides at 35 Enlihe Road. Before the war, he worked in a bank. When the December 8th Pacific War broke out, Tang was the general manager of the Bank of Communications, overseeing the bank's operations in Hong Kong. On the 20th of the same month, Hong Kong fell, and Tang came to Shanghai to contact Obara, an economic advisor to the enemy. In September of the 31st year [of the Republic], he oversaw the resumption of the bank's operations. Tang served as chairman and assisted the puppet Central Reserve Bank in carrying out its business. On March 15th of the 32nd year, he reorganized the Commercial Control Committee. During his tenure, he was entrusted by the puppet government to forcibly register yarn merchants and collect over 120,000 pieces of yarn to contribute to the enemy's transportation department. He also served as an advisor to the puppet Central Reserve Bank and supervisor of the puppet Central Savings Association. In the second half of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the puppet National Economic Commission. After the victory, he was escorted to the court by the Military Statistics Bureau. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was prosecuted under Article 2, Clauses 1, 4, and 10, of the Regulations for Punishing Chinese Traitors for conspiring with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, and disrupting finance. Tang hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Zuo De as his defense, but only lawyer Zuo came to court. Tang was a burly man, wearing a new gray long gown made of cloth and yellow leather shoes. He was neatly dressed from head to toe, had a shaved head, and his hair was already graying. He wore tortoiseshell-rimmed reading glasses on his nose, and his face was full and his demeanor calm. He stated that he had one wife and four children each (the oldest being 30 years old and the youngest 14), but only one daughter-in-law. Tang vigorously defended himself against the indictment, stating that: (1) December 21st of the 30th year [of the Republic] was not the date of the fall of Hong Kong. The defendant was detained for 114 days before being escorted to Shanghai. (2) The resumption of the Bank of Communications was being negotiated by the Bank of China before the defendant came to Shanghai, and was inspected and monitored by enemy personnel, not by colluding with the enemy. (3) Only the Bank of Communications benefited the Central Reserve Bank; the Central Reserve Bank did not benefit the Bank of Communications. (4) Major Chinese banks, including the Bank of Communications, invested in the "China Silk Company," the achievement of which was to reclaim the enemy's exclusive rights. (5) Not a single thread of yarn was used to supply the enemy. (6) The various committees of the puppet government were all nominal positions, without consent. (7) He turned himself in to the Military Statistics Bureau on September 30th of last year, not arrested. (8) The Commercial Control Committee was an autonomous organization of merchants, not colluding with the enemy. Tang also elaborated that the establishment of the "Commercial Control Committee" had two benefits for merchants: (1) Abolishing military control; (2) No restrictions on the export of materials. Therefore, it was helpful to the war of resistance and the process was managed to handle import and export affairs, distributing over 2,500 pieces of cloth to Shanghai citizens, with each person receiving fifteen feet. Regarding the puppet positions of advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, Tang stated that they were all vacant positions. As for the China Silk Company, he served as a director because of the Bank of Communications' investment, with the goal of competing with the Japanese. The amount of yarn purchased and registered reached over 245,300 pieces, half of which was funded by the Central Reserve Bank and the other half by the Japanese in gold. Therefore, it was not supplying the enemy, but the enemy supplying us, he said. At this point, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. Lawyer Zuo requested that Yuan Liang, a witness favorable to the defendant, be summoned at the next interrogation and requested to see his family on behalf of the defendant. Tang's eldest son saw his old father and was overcome with emotion, tears welling up in his eyes and even crying. Tang then advised him, "After exchanging pleasantries," and Tang was then escorted back to the court prison.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Criminal Tribunal of the High Court also interrogated Huang Xianggu and other traitors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Xianggu</p>

In May of the 28th year [of the Republic], he joined the puppet organization. He successively held positions such as puppet Central Supervisory Committee member, puppet Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, puppet Social Movement Committee member, and puppet National Economic Commission member. He dredged airfields and built highways to aid the enemy's military use. Huang claimed that all the puppet positions he held were nominal. Finally, he requested the judge to ask journalists not to publish his underground activities to prevent the world from laughing at his ugly self-promotion, which was ultimately rejected by the judge.</p>

In May of the following year, he returned to Shanghai to visit relatives and immediately joined the puppet Propaganda Department, working for Lin Xiangsheng to win over cultural writers. He also served as an editor for the China Daily, repeatedly publishing fallacies and promoting "peace movement." He also compiled the "New National Movement Essays," for the "Taiping Publishing Company," a cultural organization of the enemy. The book was translated into Japanese and highly praised by the enemy. Moreover, during his tenure in the puppet government, he attended the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference" in Tokyo. After the meeting, he used English to broadcast to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia on the need for mutual understanding of culture between the "Chinese" and Japanese nations and engaged in propaganda work. However, according to his testimony, the indictment did not conform to the facts and that he had never harmed the country or benefited the enemy.</p>
<p>Zhang Haoran</p>
<p>From Anhui, 48 years old. He stated that he joined the puppet government in the second half of the 31st year [of the Republic] and served as the Director of the puppet Foil Tax Bureau. He left that position in the 33rd year and was transferred to the Director of the puppet Candle Tax Bureau. All taxes collected were turned over to the puppet Ministry of Finance, and the accounts were truthfully reported. He never embezzled, so he had no property.</p>
<p>Ni Nongxiang</p>
<p>From Zhejiang. In July of the 32nd year [of the Republic], he partnered with traitors such as Li Shiqun and Cai Nianxiu to establish the puppet Litai Bank with a capital of 15 million yuan, serving as deputy manager, while Ye Yaoxian, the chief of the First Department of the puppet Special Operations Headquarters, served as manager. He took advantage of the situation to raise prices, disrupting finance. Ni denied all the offenses listed in the indictment.</p>
<p>Xu Hengbo</p>
<p>From Wu, 57 years old. In December of the 30th year [of the Republic], he served as a staff member of the puppet Bengbu Customs Bureau.

<p>Wang Mingyi</p>
<p>Wu Quangen, Jin Yunsheng, Qiao Lin and others were secret agents of the Beidang Road Patrol. On June 20th of last year, they searched the homes of Zhu Hanjiang and others, accusing them of hiding firearms and extorting 20 million yuan in puppet currency, and arrested the children in their families. Subsequently, the military authorities arrested Wang and others and brought them to justice. The defendants all claimed to be honest farmers.</p>

<h3>Over One Hundred Coal Businesses, Moved by Righteous Indignation, Report Yi Taixing and Shen Jinzhou for Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Yi Taixing Coal Company and its manager, Shen Jinzhou, colluded with a small number of coal businesses during the period of enemy rule, secretly acting on the orders of the enemy's "Asia Development Board" and "Embassy" to organize the puppet "Dazhong Coal Company," with Shen as chairman. They enforced coal weight controls on behalf of the enemy, planned the supply of coal to the enemy's military, and used vile methods to promote the "dual standard system" of military scrip and puppet currency for the enemy. People in the coal industry suffered greatly under their oppression and detested their actions. After the victory, 127 companies jointly signed a report, along with 33 pieces of evidence, detailing nine major crimes, and submitted them separately to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate and the Military Affairs Commission Investigation and Statistics Bureau for legal action. After investigation, Shen was arrested and imprisoned on the morning of the 2nd of this month. At the original location of "Dazhong Coal Company," a large amount of evidence and documents were seized, including 91 case files, 15 meeting minutes, 47 account books, and two sacks of letters. At the time, the "regulations" formulated by Shen and others were also found, with the year on the cover written as "Showa 17" (1942), showing their flattery of the enemy and forgetfulness of their ancestors. Currently, over one hundred coal businesses in this city are requesting the authorities to severely punish them in order to uphold national law, and are calling on all sectors of society to uphold national law and promote justice.</p>

<h3>Landing Craft Successfully Trial Voyage, Kirk Hosts Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, returned to this area after a trial voyage between Shanghai and Chongqing on the fleet's landing craft a few days ago. At 4:30 PM yesterday, he specially hosted reporters from this city to make a statement. The landing craft traveled from Shanghai to Chongqing two weeks ago, taking only 144 hours. It took two days to go from Chongqing to Yichang and two days from Yichang to Hankou. After this success, they plan to prepare more ships to transport supplies to the interior. Admiral Kirk denied that the US Navy had established bases in Qingdao or other Chinese ports.

<h3>Military Officer Stabbed to Death in Small Wood Bridge Vegetable Shed, Wife and Soldier Flee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qi Yunwang, a 34-year-old student from the 13th Company of the 3rd Officer Corps directly under the Ministry of Military Administration, was originally a company commander in the 9th Engineering Regiment. He had just come to Shanghai from Zhengzhou for training. The company was stationed in the Taikang Biscuit Factory on Xiaomuqiao Road. Qi brought his wife, children, and a soldier, residing in a nearby Yinjiazhai residence. On the 14th, Qi stayed at the company headquarters. Around 3:00 PM on the 15th, Qi went to the Central District of the city with his courier to watch a play, while his wife, Ms. Li, stayed home. Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a farmer, Gu Liangqi, discovered the body of a military officer in a vegetable garden opposite the Western Dairy Farm in Yinjiazhai. The Changshu District Police Bureau was notified, and Deputy Bureau Chief Huang Zhen personally led police officers from the Judicial Section to conduct an on-site investigation, discovering a knife wound in the abdomen, with the omentum flowing out, and a knife wound in the throat, with the trachea severely lacerated. The murder weapon, a vegetable-chopping paring knife of the sharpest kind, was found next to the body. It was later learned that the deceased was Qi, so his home was investigated, only to find that it had been emptied of its residents. His wife, Ms. Li, and the soldier, Yu Chenglong, had fled, taking a one-year-old child and all valuables with them. According to his subordinates, Li married Qi in the 32nd year [of the Republic]. She had a lover in her hometown. It is unknown whether Qi's sudden and tragic death and the subsequent departure of his wife and the soldier was due to an illicit relationship between her and Yu that led to this extreme measure. The soldier, Yu Chenglong, is of medium height, with a thin, long face, a round shaved head, and a Henan accent. Ms. Li has an oval face, short hair, and wears a blue cloth cheongsam over a fine checkered lined robe. The luggage contains a red cloth quilt cover and an tan military blanket. Military and police forces along the way should pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>City New Life Movement Stresses Thrift to Shift Societal Corruption</h3>

Practicing thrift and shifting societal extravagance and corruption is an urgent matter. The Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association has specially signed a plan to encourage all citizens to implement a thrift campaign in order to complete the great task of nation-building.</p>
<h3>Five Million People Will Become Starving Corpses, Guangdong Food Urgently Needs Relief, Drought Causes Rice Prices to Reach 100,000 Per Dan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ling Daoyang, Director of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Regional Office, stated at a press conference yesterday that if Guangdong Province does not receive sufficient food relief immediately, five million people will starve to death within one or two months. Ling solemnly declared that before taking office, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" and the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Standing Bureau had promised to supply Guangdong Province with 33,000 tons of flour and 55,000 tons of rice, but he had actually received only 9,564 tons of flour and 1,535 tons of rice, less than two-tenths of the original amount.</p>
<p>No Rain for Half a Year, Farmland Barren</p>
<p>Ling stated that Guangdong is one of the most populous provinces in the occupied areas, with a total of 35 million people, second only to Shandong and Jiangsu. In the past two or three decades, Guangdong's rice imports accounted for seven-tenths of the national total. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the disaster has been particularly widespread and severe. Six million acres of farmland have been abandoned due to unrepaired dikes. There are 800,000 people in Guangdong who are engaged in fishing, and almost all of the 30,000 fishing boats they rely on for livelihood were destroyed by the Japanese. In addition, the weather has been dry, with no rain for half a year, causing rice prices to reach over 100,000, and the hardship and suffering of the people of Guangdong can be said to have reached an extreme. The Guangdong Regional Office has received far less food than the original amount, causing great disappointment to the people of Guangdong and leading to dissatisfaction with the work of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration". The relief work in the province is divided into eleven districts for implementation: Guangzhou, Taishan, Qujiang, Yuyao, Huiyang, Shantou, Maoming, Zhanjiang, Huanshan, Lehui, and Danxian. Taking Guangzhou as an example, four affordable dining halls have been established, serving 25,000 people a day; twelve porridge kitchens, serving 20,000 people a day; and an affordable bakery, supplying approximately 6,500 citizens with bread every day.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Sub-Office's Work</p>
<p>Many overseas Chinese in Thailand are originally from Shantou. They donated a total of 5,115 tons of rice. The "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" was only responsible for transporting this rice. Of this, 3,115 tons have been transported to Shantou, 1,500 tons have been used for relief in Guangzhou, and 500 tons have been transported to Hainan Island. This rice is not owned by the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration", so the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" entrusted the Youth Corps, the Senate, and others to handle the relief matters. There were some procedures that were not handled properly. General Zhang Fakui has ordered a thorough investigation. The Guangdong Regional Office is successfully distributing medicine and old clothes and repatriating refugees to their hometowns. As for work relief, 170,000 workers have been mobilized to repair the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, costing a total of 350 tons of flour. This road is expected to be completed in early next month. In addition, many refugees are engaged in reclamation, and 37 fishermen's cooperatives have been established. To restore farmland, dikes are being repaired, mobilizing 21,000 people every day. A sawmill has been built, planning to saw 200,000 railroad ties in each period for the restoration of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.</p>
<p>Requesting Increased Funding, More Material Assistance</p>
<p>Ling's purpose in coming to Shanghai is to: (1) request increased funding from the General Office. The current monthly funding of 20 million yuan is not even enough for one-fourth of the required transportation costs. (2) Ask the General Office to request more material assistance from the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration". (3) Request more experts, as the current relief work is often only assisted by some pastors and churches. Ling then introduced Mr. Martin, Director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Sub-Office, who praised Ling for his tireless efforts in working under extremely complex and difficult circumstances. He also listed the reasons why relief work in Guangdong Province is so difficult: (1) inconvenient transportation, (2) poor economy, (3) various geographical difficulties. He hopes that the roads can be opened as soon as possible to transport relief materials to Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Ling finally stated that he would return to Guangdong in three or four days. When asked by reporters about the results of his negotiations in Shanghai, he replied: "I really dare not say!" It seems that the fate of over five million people in Guangdong Province is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Materials Supply Bureau Established, Purchasing Surplus Materials from the US and Canada to Meet Various Needs, US Military Sells Dock Equipment to Us, Agreement Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau was officially announced yesterday. The office is located on the third floor of the former Deutsche Bank building. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau's mission is to purchase surplus US military materials from the US and Canada under the US and Canada loan funds, according to the instructions of Premier Song. These include ships, locomotives, carriages, radio materials, automobiles, airplanes, photographic materials, and military rations. Only a small portion of these items has arrived in port. The allocation of these materials will prioritize government agencies, with priority given to those agencies that applied before or during the war. As for commercial materials, the bureau will first assess the needs of the market to stabilize prices. The principle is to maintain prices at a reasonable level and protect the living standards of consumers, that is, to strengthen purchasing power without fluctuating market prices.</p>
<p>In addition, the US military is selling dock equipment from various Pacific islands to China for the rehabilitation of Chinese seafarers and the modernization of Chinese docks. Our side signed an agreement with the US Navy in Shanghai yesterday. The agreement includes pier tools and cranes worth $15,000,000, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. Qian Dajun from our side and Admiral Kirk from the US side were both present at the signing ceremony. This equipment will help China rebuild its destroyed docks.</p>

<h3>胡西園's Opinions on the Expanded Production Conference</h3>

He presented various opinions, expressing his support for the industrial sector's initiative. He also advocated that the expanded production conference should invite as many representatives from industrial organizations as possible to facilitate coordination during the meeting. It is noted that during the Anti-Japanese War, in May of the 28th year (1939) and July of the 32nd year (1943), the central government convened two national production conferences in Chongqing, both presided over by Chairman Chiang in person. Hu Xiyuan served as a member of the preparatory committee and the convener of the industrial group for both of these conferences. Director Wu placed great importance on the suggestions made by Mr. Hu.</p>

They stated that the employees involved in the incident were also detained for questioning. Although the facts are clear, they trust that the Garrison Headquarters will handle the matter legally. However, they added that they are serving to make a living, and the misunderstanding caused while performing their duties has caused them immense physical and mental suffering, which is difficult to fully express. Therefore, they hope to receive sympathy and guidance from all sectors and sincerely wish that the soldiers of our country can understand their plight.</p>

<h3>Loyalty Forever: Memorial Service for Martyr General Zhang Zizhong; All Sectors Hold Public Memorial Service; Solemn and Tragic Atmosphere; Over 5,000 Attendees</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday marked the sixth anniversary of the martyrdom of Zhang Zizhong, a famous anti-Japanese general and national hero. The municipal party, government, military, and various public organizations held a public memorial service at the Shandong Association on Ximen Road yesterday afternoon. More than 5,000 people attended. The atmosphere in the memorial hall was solemn and tragic.</p>
<p>The public memorial service began at around 2:00 PM, with Kong Xiangxi as the chief officiant, accompanied by Li and Wu Shaoshu. Qian Dajun, due to other matters, arrived and took his position at 1:00 PM. A moment of silence was observed to express grief, followed by the offering of incense, flag, and elegiac music. Three bows were made to the portrait of the late General Zhang.</p>
<p>The memorial address stated: "On the 16th day of May in the 35th year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi, Qian Dajun, Li and Wu Shaoshu, respectfully offer this sacrifice to the spirit of General. Our country gained you, an elite from Shandong, a high-ranking general, and a great wall defending the country. The Battle of Fei River, the victory at Linyi, severely damaged the enemy's advance, a fierce display. Fighting in Xiang River, advancing the cause. Conferring upon us the meritorious official, All are delighted. Amidst the slander and praise, unwavering and persistent, Your ambition to serve the country is extraordinary. Six years since your demise, your commanding presence echoes in the wind and clouds, your dignified composure lingers in our minds. Your unwavering loyalty to the nation, unshaken and true. May your spirit be aware, and your soul find solace. Enduring for ten thousand years, your portrait will be enshrined. Respectfully offered."</p>
<p>Subsequently, students from the National Conservatory of Music sang a dirge. After the song, Kong gave a speech, recounting the deceased general's selfless service and heroic battles, stating that his sacrifice laid the foundation for today's victory. He added that nation-building is not yet complete, and those who have not died should strive to create a free, peaceful, and democratic nation where people can live and work in peace, a task ten times harder than the War of Resistance. Zhang Zizhong's younger brother, Ziming, then gave a speech of thanks. The ceremony concluded at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Silk banners and memorial texts adorned the memorial hall. Chairman Chiang's inscription "Loyalty Forever" hung prominently in the center. This newspaper's couplet read: "Distinguish right from wrong, vow steadfast loyalty, the party's light, the country unites." "Dedicate loyalty, sacrifice life, the soul undimmed, the spirit enduring." Yan Huiqing's couplet read: "The Battle of Suizao, the foundation of victory, the sun and moon shine on his unwavering devotion, the swiftness of his heroic wind is recorded in history." "After the Great Wall, fighting to the death, the rivers and mountains honored by his blood, famous generals rarely live to old age." The United Daily News's couplet read: "The Xiang River sobs with cold currents, his heroic spirit lingers, still mindful of the land not yet recovered, half of the ruins are overgrown with weeds, the world awaits to be restored." "The bones of loyalty are buried in the Shu mountains, his ambition has been fulfilled, sharing with the bright moon, a plum blossom tree, the fragrance of reverence shared for thousands of years." All are eloquent and worthy of recitation.</p>

Representatives from various provinces, including Lu Yan, Guan Mingchu, Wang Ruiqin, and Zhou Jintang from Henan; Chen Qitian from Hunan; Sun Meiwu from Suiyuan; as well as representatives from Gansu, Hebei, Qinghai, Sichuan, Hejiang, Shanxi, Tianjin, Kunming, and more than ten others, arrived in Shanghai to sightsee. This morning, they will visit Hangzhou and then return to Shanghai before heading back to Nanjing and their respective provinces. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaogang, Xu Jilun, Luo Qinghua, Ge Jechen, and Jin Runxiang from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a public banquet for the representatives at the Lido Garden last night at 7:00 PM. Gong Zhizhan, Cheng Cangbo, and about 40 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the banquet, Wang Xiaogang delivered a welcoming speech, expressing his delight that 31 units had attended the meeting in Nanjing (originally scheduled to include 43 units from the nine northeastern provinces). This spirit of unity and enthusiastic sentiment symbolize a bright future. He also stated that he had presented a request to the chairman to convene a conference of national agricultural, industrial, commercial, and specialized scholars to formulate plans to effectively curb prices and develop industry and commerce to overcome the current difficulties. Representatives from various provinces then reported on the current situation in their respective provinces. The most serious problems at present are the Yellow River flood area and the disaster in Hunan, and the communist occupation of some areas, which hinders the development of industry and commerce, is particularly painful. In the Henan and Suiyuan areas, the communists forcibly occupy land, destroy morality and education, forcibly separate families, massacre intellectuals, and destroy productive enterprises, especially by destroying transportation. The only hope for the people in these areas is that the Chinese and British governments will recover the lost territories and eliminate the destructive work of the communists. According to Yang Qingtian, deputy editor of the Zhengzhou Zhongbao, the newspaper industry in Henan is not very developed. Kaifeng is more advanced, with a total of 12 newspapers, but even the most popular does not exceed 7,000 copies. Four newspapers are published in Zhengzhou, and the people there greatly welcome the Shenbao, Xinmin, and Dagong newspapers from Shanghai, especially the Shenbao, which has the highest sales, reaching more than 5,000 copies per day, exceeding the local newspapers. However, due to current transportation difficulties, it takes at least two days to read them.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Actual Sales and Speculation Work Together - Gold Prices Rose Again Yesterday - Many Mysterious Rumors About its Destination</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to easing credit, persistent buying interest, and the abundance of capital from the countryside, with civilians still possessing the ability to hoard gold, prices rebounded. Morning opening prices were similar to the previous closing prices. After the opening, there were some sell-offs after prices increased, and some profit-taking in the middle of the day, causing prices to drop to 1.715 million. Countryside silver shops absorbed some of this. Around 10:00 AM, prices rebounded to fluctuate around the morning opening price. The Central Bank allocated 268 taels to traders at a price of 1.74 million, after which prices slightly decreased. Easing credit conditions led to frequent absorption by various hot money sources. The general sentiment, though not daring to extravagantly hope for control from the Central Bank, considered that prices below 1.7 million would not drop much further given historical trends, and those with surplus capital were not hesitant to buy. Securities firms also joined in, increasing activity, but with little trading, capital became limited. At noon, prices rose to around 1.8 million. In the afternoon, people continued to speculate about the current environment, and mysterious rumors about the destination of gold spread, continuing the upward trend. As a result, prices closed 70,000 higher than the previous closing. Decorative gold also rose to 193,000, standard silver rose to 1,700, and silver dollar prices rose by half a percent. Secret interest rates were unstable, ranging from 1.6 to 2 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained stable, passively fluctuating with Yu Jia's price. The morning opening price was 2,300 yuan, then gradually dropped to 2,270 yuan, remaining below 2,300 yuan. It only rebounded to 2,330 yuan at noon, stabilizing slightly at noon. The overall market invigorated in the afternoon, and was again positively influenced, closing 40 yuan higher than the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar capital was tight, influenced by the Hong Kong exchange rate, initially flat, then stable, closing 5 yuan higher. The Hong Kong exchange rate was initially flat, then firm, with buying interest increasing, rising from 410 yuan to 425 yuan. Robi was at 525 yuan, all selling prices. The US exchange rate was nominally flat but secretly stagnant.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Drop - Both Bulls and Bears are Waiting for an Opportunity</h3>
<p>Government bond prices were stable, with both bulls and bears waiting for an opportunity. Some hot money flowed to the gold market. Unified Class C bonds started the morning at 7,450 yuan, then fluctuated down to around 7,050 yuan, fluctuating slightly around 7,100 yuan at noon, closing 150 yuan lower than the previous closing. Classes A and B dropped slightly by 50 yuan each, while Classes D and E dropped by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Gradually Recover - Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>After being weak, Chinese stocks gradually stabilized, with miscellaneous capital joining in. Prices gradually recovered after the opening, with small stocks being weaker. At the lowest point in the morning, Yongsha was at 4,950 yuan, Meiya at 4,050 yuan, Jingfu at 130 yuan, Xinguang at 265 yuan, and Qindian at 235 yuan. Prices gradually recovered, reaching high prices at noon. Yongsha at 5,300 yuan, Meiya at 4,400 yuan, and Jingfu at 338 yuan, then slightly decreased. Xinguang and Qinxing closed at their highest prices. As a result, Yongsha and Meiya each rose by about half a percent, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose slightly, the medium-sized stock Rongfeng was intentionally lowered, Xinhe and Heping and Zhongfang and Dahua each rose slightly, the unpopular small stocks were flat, and the veteran stocks were still sluggish. Guangdong capital purchased companies, calling for prices above 2,600. After continuous profit-taking by bulls in foreign stocks, capital flowed into the hands of powerful players, and the market became drier. Yisha opened slightly higher than the previous day's closing price, and there was occasional short covering. Various stocks then gradually rose, led by Yisha, with enthusiasm in the financial sector. Prices turned high at noon, stabilizing slightly at noon, closing about 10% higher than the previous closing. Paper stocks were more attractive to investors because they were lower than Yipi, and rose by 20%.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stable - Cotton Trading Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was initially weak but eventually stable. Large yarn shipments were still small, and medium and small yarn shipments softened due to observers from Beijing and Wuhu. Each brand of cotton yarn decreased by about 10,000 yuan. At the close of the market, the situation stabilized due to replenishment by local retail stores. Four-inch two-strand thread rose by as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan because the Textile Construction Company did not supply the same industry yesterday.</p>
<p>The demand for cloth was normal from both out-of-town buyers and local shops. Shilin cloth and twelve-pound fine cloth were loose, while Daming Fu silk and grey twill were slightly firm.</p>
<p>In the cotton market, New York and American cotton prices fell by 17 to 19 pounds. Recent US dollars were at 26.98, forward prices at 27.58, and Meterlin spot prices at 27.78. Local cotton trading was better. Nantong Dasheng, Suzhou Sulun, and Chongming Jiafeng are all said to be purchasing cotton.</p>
<h3>Sugar Auction Prices Increase - An Immediate Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded because the previously rumored large sale of sugar by a new company did not materialize, and the auction price of enemy property sugar by the association increased. The market gradually rose, with medium sugar and white sugar initially at 64,000 yuan in the morning, then rising through 5,000 yuan, 5,500 yuan, 6,000 yuan, 66,500 yuan, and 70,000 yuan, to 67,250 yuan to 77,500 yuan in the afternoon. Raw sugar was at 56,000 yuan, three-and-a-half white grass sugar was at 68,500 yuan to 71,000 yuan, and Benmian white sugar was at 71,200 yuan. The total amount of sugar auctioned was over 2,000 pieces, with only dozens of bags of raw sugar sold at 60,000 yuan because it was 4,000 yuan higher than the privately negotiated price. Four-and-a-half car white sugar was at 88,000 yuan, with over 330 bags sold.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Bottoms are Sharp</h3>
<p>Since merchants from Nanjing and Tianjin have been active in the producing areas of Hangzhou's new Qiangqiang tea, the local market has become increasingly bullish. Most holders are stopping losses and holding on, resulting in less trading, but bottoms are generally sharp. As for the Wenzhou Xinlongjing tea, which has been arriving for days with declining quality, buyers are competing to sell it off as before, and the market is still lackluster. The supply and demand for aged tea is balanced, and the trend is still hovering. Export green teas, such as the specially selected Gong Xi Ran Zhen brush, are still favored by buyers, but it is difficult to find an outlet for sales, and the situation is again quiet.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable. 120 Tianqiao glossy rayon was bid at 1.38 million yuan, and the lowest bid in the middle was 1.35 million yuan, eventually traded at 360,000 yuan. 120 Tianqiao non-glossy rayon had half a box traded at 1.95 million yuan, factory and foreign firm goods were at 2.5 million yuan for 83 points of uniformity, and 2.35 million yuan for 81 points of uniformity. Jardine Matheson had some purchases yesterday. The prices of other grades of goods were similar to the previous day. Ordinary goods were slightly better, and silk goods were slightly weaker. Meiya bedcovers were down 10,000 yuan per 100, and Dacheng checked crepe was down 140 to 150 yuan per yard. Other goods did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>South American Rice - Dajiang Sells Off 20,000 Tons - Local Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market rose because the inland market was firm and buyers were strong. Jingxiu rice continued to rise by 500 to 600 yuan. Flour had no outlet in foreign ports, and local demand was still slack, causing prices to fall by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market became depressed again due to the large arrival of Qingdao goods in Shanghai, falling by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were slightly weak, soybean cakes had little supply or demand, bran demand was weak, falling by another 400 to 500 yuan, sesame seeds were also down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and corn sales in Qingdao had decreased, causing the market to soften. Mung beans were flat, and red beans were also stagnant. All grains except rice prices were weak. Yesterday, the rice that arrived in Shanghai, according to the rice market, totaled over 4,000 shi. The types and amounts are as follows: White Japonica rice 2,414 shi, early rice 742 shi, thin rice 680 shi, sheep indica rice 132 shi, Du indica rice 385 shi, and White Yuan 55 shi.</p>
<p>In other news, the sale of foreign rice by Dajiang Enterprise Company yesterday greatly stimulated the grain market. Grain administration officials and soybean and rice firms went to the company to negotiate orders. According to the person in charge of the company, after six months, 20,000 tons of rice were purchased in South America, and the company chartered a cargo ship in the United States to depart from South America next month. The Ministry of Food purchased 16,000 tons yesterday. The foreign rice is divided into two types, with a selling price of 175 to 197 US dollars per ton (delivered to the Shanghai shore, including freight, insurance, bagging, etc.). The company charges the Ministry of Food a handling fee of 0.25%, and merchants a handling fee of 0.5%. A deposit is also collected, temporarily 5% for the Ministry of Food and 10% to 50% for merchants. The rice quality is similar to Du-indica.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Sichuan Rice - Has Arrived in Hankou</h3>
<p>The first batch of 24 tons of Sichuan rice, which the Ministry of Food previously planned to allocate to Hubei Province (2 million shi), has arrived in Hankou on a US landing craft. It is heard that the craft is a dedicated vessel for transporting Sichuan grain to Hubei. This was a trial voyage, and the results were good. Now that the Yangtze River water level has risen, the authorities are preparing to use a large number of ships to transport rice to Hankou. It is heard that after the food arrives successively, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Food will distribute it at parity prices in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei Province in order to regulate the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>The Rice Markets in the North and South - Are Difficult to Restore in Practice</h3>
<p>Recently, there were widespread rumors that the temporary rice market in Shanghai will be abolished, and that all rice and grains will be traded in the north and south markets. According to Xing Zhigang, director of the market management committee, the rice market has never considered this matter. There are many difficulties in implementing this measure. In the past, rice and grain trading was divided into two markets, the South Market located at the Fengji Wharf and the North Market located at the Xinzha Bridge. Since the war, the Fengji Wharf in the South Market has been damaged. Currently, repairing it would not only take a long time, but also require a lot of capital. Recently, only a small number of rice and grain brokers have made such calls.</p>
<h3>Too Little Rain Impedes Cotton Production - Part of the American Cotton Needs to be Replanted</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 16th] According to the official weekly cotton planting climate report, cotton planting in most of the southern states of the United States has been affected by the lack of timely rain. Some areas must be replanted, especially Arkansas.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Recently, large quantities of coconut oil and copra have been shipped from Nanyang, Little Luzon, and Siam. Due to the slack demand, not only have prices plummeted, but no one is interested in buying them. Coconut oil was considered a rare commodity one or two months ago, with prices reaching 340,000 to 350,000 per dan. Yesterday's market price was only 100,000 per dan.</p>
<p>The establishment of cotton cloth distribution points by Zhongfang has caused opposition from cotton cloth merchants. After representatives from both sides negotiated, a temporary agreement has been reached. The Cotton Cloth Business Association is currently collecting opinions on the establishment of cotton cloth distribution points to ensure caution.</p>
<p>[Reuters Alexandria, 16th] It is heard that China's interest in Egyptian cotton is increasing. The French Purchasing Committee needs good quality cotton, but the barter trade between Egypt and Italy is currently at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Negotiations between the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Construction Bureaus and China Silk Corporation Regarding Cocoon Purchasing and Silk Reeling; Standard Cocoon Price Calculation Method Also Drafted</h3>
<p>With the cocoon season approaching, the cocoon purchasing activities of various manufacturers have become extremely active due to the assistance of Shanghai's cocoon purchasing loan banks. Zhejiang Province is scheduled to start purchasing from the 18th, and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces will also begin procurement successively. Regarding this year's cocoon purchasing and silk reeling, the China Silk Corporation recently held discussions with representatives from the Construction Bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to carry out the following points: (1) Municipal scales should be used for cocoon collection. (2) Standard cocoon prices should be established. (3) Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should separately formulate management plans for cocoon merchants and silk factories. (4) Allocation of autumn silkworm eggs between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces need 300,000 sheets of autumn eggs this year. Zhejiang Province will supply 150,000 sheets themselves, and the remainder will be supplied by Jiangsu. Jiangsu Province will cold-store 450,000 sheets of pure autumn eggs as the standard. (5) The two provincial governments will subsidize egg prices to encourage superior varieties. (6) Representatives from the Construction Bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will separately liaise and promote the organization of the Silkworm Egg Industry Association of the Third District (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Nanjing and Shanghai). (7) Registration of native silk merchants will be conducted immediately to gradually reduce native silk production. (8) Improvement guidance fees will be collected uniformly on native silkworm cocoons and improved silkworm cocoons. (9) Silkworm egg management should be restored to pre-war methods, and a silkworm cultivation improvement fee and egg price subsidy should be levied appropriately on dried cocoons. (10) During the cocoon season, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will issue orders to county governments and security teams to earnestly protect and facilitate all personnel, funds, and other storage and transportation matters related to silkworm cocoon trading. (11) Silkworm silk workers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the management personnel stationed by the China Silk Corporation for cocoon collection should establish contact and assist each other at any time. In addition to drafting the above matters, the three parties' representatives also drafted a method for calculating standard cocoon prices. Assuming a silk price of 2,500,000 yuan (20/22 78%), with a reeling yield of 400 catties and a processing fee of 800,000 yuan, the cocoon cost is 1,700,000 yuan, the dry cocoon price (1,700,000 / 4) is 425,000 yuan, the cocoon drying, interest, and transportation costs (per picul) are 100,000 yuan, the net dry cocoon price is 325,000 yuan, and the fresh cocoon price (325,000 / 2.8) is 116,000 yuan (Sima scale). For every increase or decrease of ten catties in the reeling yield, the fresh cocoon price will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Tight Money in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Air Dispatch] Due to tight money and high interest rates in Shanghai, ordinary loans are around 1.5 to 2 points per month. This has led those with idle funds to sit back and enjoy the benefits. In addition, general merchants are in urgent need of funds and are scrambling everywhere. As a result, the long-depleted monetary atmosphere in Chongqing has suddenly turned profitable since the beginning of this month, and there is a growing trend of tightness. Interest rates have already increased. It is heard that yesterday, interest rates for loans until the end of the month were 2.8 yuan per day, and it was still not easy to obtain them. Money lenders everywhere are reporting shortages.</p>
<h3>Price of Xinghua Longans Soars Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Due to scarce rainfall in the producing areas of Xinghua longans, mountain shipments are difficult and sources are scarce, resulting in an unusual shortage of spot goods in Shanghai.

<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Predicts Post-War World Trade Situation: Three-Fourths in British-American Zone; Capitalism and Communism Form Two Groups</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 15th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Vinson testified again today before the House Banking and Currency Committee considering the loan to Britain, predicting that 75% of post-war world trade will take place in the British and American zones. Michigan Republican Representative Crawford asked if this meant the world would be divided into two economic groups, one British-American capitalism and the other Soviet communism. Vinson replied, "In my opinion, we must recognize this situation. Britain occupies an important position in world trade. If the British-American zone, which accounts for 75% of world trade, can reach an understanding on monetary and trade practices, we can hope that its trade will expand to more than 75%." Vinson warned that if the loan agreement to Britain is not approved, American trade will be restricted in the world market, or even have no foothold in many places. He strongly stated that the United States does not need an economic war. He said that the goal of the loan agreement to Britain is to eliminate discriminatory trade practices.</p>

<h3>What I Saw in England: The Suez Knot</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xueyan, London Air Dispatch, May 3rd</p>
<p>Since the United Nations was born, the first real difficulty it encountered was the Iranian issue. Fortunately, on the one hand, the representatives of various countries in the Security Council did their best to uphold the Charter, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union and Iran were able to directly negotiate with a spirit of mutual compromise outside the Council, reaching an agreement in a state of being neither too close nor too far. Although this case is still on the books of the United Nations today, as long as Soviet troops withdraw from northern Iran before May 6, this account can probably be written off. If no further complications arise in the future, there should be no more disturbances. The details of the handling of this case in the United Nations have probably been published in detail in domestic newspapers, so there is no need to elaborate further.</p>
<p>Why is the United States' Attitude So Resolute?</p>
<p>In the debates in the Security Council, it seems at first glance that there is a U.S.-Soviet confrontation, especially when the meeting was held in New York, this trend seemed very obvious. Almost everywhere, the United States took the lead, and Britain and the remaining countries supported it. In fact, we know that the real conflict of interest in Iran is between Britain and the Soviet Union, not between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, if this dispute were led by Britain to confront the Soviet Union, the effect would probably not be so great, and therefore the results would probably not be satisfactory. One point worth noting here is that in this dispute, the U.S. government has consistently sympathized with Britain's position, which is beyond question. However, the actions of the U.S. government are often influenced by public opinion. Although the American people also sympathize with Britain's position and will certainly support the government and support the United States, the question is the degree to which they will do so. If the U.S. government is only in a position to support, then, once both sides insist and a stalemate develops, or even need to consider the issue of strength, will the American people always remain firm, risking confrontation with the Soviet Union for the sake of British interests, or is there no problem? Therefore, when it comes to critical moments, differences in the attitudes of Britain and the United States will inevitably affect the outcome. On the contrary, if the U.S. government takes the lead, the situation will be different. Every time both sides insist, it will involve the issue of the United States' prestige, and American public opinion cannot talk about retreating. And Britain, because its own interests are involved, must support the United States. The seamless cooperation between Britain and the United States is the main factor in the safe passage of this Iranian dispute. The Iranian issue is not directly related to the United States. Why is the United States' attitude so resolute? Does the U.S. authorities feel that in order to maintain the dignity of the United Nations, it needs strong U.S. support, and therefore, it is using the Iranian issue to express its determination to support it? Or is there a tacit understanding in diplomatic questions between Britain and the United States? We certainly cannot know. However, it is worth noting that when the Iranian issue was causing a great deal of commotion, the British Foreign Office suddenly sent a note to the Soviet Union protesting its interpretation of the war booty in the Eastern Three Provinces. The wording was extremely cautious, but the intention to support the United States was very obvious.</p>
<p>But if we are more demanding, we know that although the Security Council claims to have succeeded, it only safely passed the crisis itself, and did not actually resolve the dispute between the Soviet Union and Iran. The real solution to the dispute is still the agreement directly negotiated between the two countries. However, during the negotiation period, the United Nations was able to help boost its reputation, making Iran's position strengthened invisibly. Therefore, the agreement could be established more smoothly, which is true. Therefore, the real function of the United Nations is only this. Some people say that being able to do this is already not easy. Or this is very correct, and a realistic view.</p>
<p>A Set of Nets to Prevent Oil Rights from Overflowing</p>
<p>The main parts of the Soviet-Iranian agreement are three points: (1) Soviet troops stationed in northern Iran will be completely withdrawn before May 6. (2) The Soviet Union and Iran will jointly form an oil company to develop the oil fields in northern Iran. The company contract is tentatively set at 50 years. For the first 25 years, the Soviet Union will own 51% of the shares, and Iran will own 49%. For the next 25 years, the situation is exactly the opposite. The contract needs to be approved by the Iranian Parliament. Therefore, the agreement also stipulates that the oil company contract should be submitted to the parliament for approval within seven months from March 24. (3) The Soviet Union recognizes the independence movement in northern Iran as an internal affair of Iran, but it also recognizes it as a democratic movement, hoping that the Iranian government can resolve it legally. On the surface, these three points are independent of each other and have no connection with each other. The Soviet Union does not take the satisfactory completion of points (2) and (3) as a condition for withdrawing troops. But in fact, since they are negotiated at the same time, they naturally have a symbiotic relationship. At a time when the world is thirsty for oil, Iran, a small country, happens to have a lot of oil. It is really suffering from the illness of being guilty of having wealth. Iran itself, of course, also understands its own weaknesses, so it has pre-arranged a set of nets in legislation to prevent oil rights from falling into the hands of foreigners. According to the law enacted by the Iranian Parliament in the autumn of 1944, any prime minister or minister, or their representative, cannot negotiate oil rights with foreign governments or foreign companies without the approval of the parliament, otherwise the result is invalid. Therefore, the result of the Soviet-Iranian negotiations on oil rights can only take legal effect with the approval of the parliament. But we know that the Iranian Parliament has now been dissolved, and on the eve of its dissolution, it passed a law stipulating that when there are still foreign troops stationed within the territory, new parliamentary elections cannot be held. Therefore, the longer Soviet troops continue to be stationed in northern Iran, the longer a new parliament cannot be established. The second article of the Soviet-Iranian agreement requesting a deadline for parliamentary approval is all adapted to the national conditions of Iran. Soviet troops are scheduled to withdraw completely before May 6, and the oil field contract will be submitted to the parliament for approval about five and a half months after May 6. Of course, it is expected that the new parliament can escape in accordance with the law within five and a half months after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and the agreement can be approved as expected.</p>
<p>Old Case Replayed: No Fresh Meaning</p>
<p>Why do we always say that the Soviet-Iranian dispute is directly related to Britain? This should be viewed from various historical, political, and economic perspectives. An important cornerstone of Britain's traditional foreign policy is to ensure the safety of the transportation line to the Far East. If a hostile power extends its influence to the vicinity of this transportation line, it considers itself threatened, and often does not hesitate to use all means to weaken this hostile power's strength here. Therefore, when France was strong in the Middle East, Britain competed with France. And when Tsarist Russia or the Soviet Union was strong, Britain also clashed with it. Conversely, on the Soviet side, whenever it is full of strength, it wants to go south and enter the Indian Ocean, which is also an old saying that everyone knows. Therefore, the intersection of the two countries' forces is also the point of interest, always in the area of Iran and the Dardanelles. Using historical precedents to prove that the harmony and conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union are largely determined by whether the conflict of interest in the above two places is resolved or eased. Therefore, the British-Soviet conflict recently manifested in the Iranian incident is just a rehash of the old story and has little fresh meaning. Northern Iran has always been considered to be within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. If the development of Soviet power is only limited to this, Britain can still tolerate it. But if troops are not withdrawn and continue to move south, it will inevitably directly threaten Britain's transportation line. Therefore, before the Soviet Union's intentions were clear, Britain was particularly uneasy. And when this case was submitted to the Security Council for discussion, Britain's willingness to work so hard was on the one hand to warn the Soviet Union that it would risk conflict with Britain, and on the other hand, to make the Soviet Union understand to stop at the right time. Looking again at the agreement established by the Soviet Union and Iran this time, one of the main purposes of the Soviet Union is oil rights. If the Soviet Union only wants to obtain the oil fields in northern Iran, Britain would not excessively clamor. But hundreds of miles east of the northern Iranian border are British oil wells in Iraq, and hundreds of miles south are British oil fields in Abadan (Adalen). And when the popular movement for independence in northern Iran, its Kurds族 called on the Kurds of Iraq to rise up and fight together. This is also one of the reasons that made Britain feel chilled. Therefore, when the Soviet-Iranian dispute was being debated in the United Nations, whether it was in London led by Britain to confront the Soviet Union, or in New York led by the United States to confront the Soviet Union, the entire UK always paid attention, never slackening for a moment, until the dispute came to an end and the Soviet Union had a definite date for withdrawing troops, then Britain seemed to have taken a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>When the Soviet-Iranian issue was in full swing, the British House of Commons sent several representatives to Iran to observe and investigate the truth on the spot. In particular, they wanted to enter the Soviet-occupied area, the lair of the separatist movement in northern Iran, namely Azerbaijan, to see the actual situation. In fact, because the Soviet army blocked them, they were unable to enter northern Iran and only reached Tehran. It can be said that they did not achieve their goal, but they gained a little direct impression. According to one of the representatives, Michael Foot, the general impression of Iran is that Britain's past policies towards Iran were wrong. He said: "Britain entered Iran in 1941 with only an army and no policy." To this day, the general Iranian only knows that Britain is an aggressive imperialist and a reactionary, who does not recognize the requirements of the times and does not understand the needs of the Iranian people. He believes that the most powerful political party in Iran today is the Tudeh Party, but the Tudeh Party is pro-Soviet and anti-British. However, even before the Tudeh Party colluded with the Soviet Union, it had already been tainted with anti-British sentiment. According to him, this is the result of the British authorities' ignoring the development of new forces. Because British local officials lack foresight and only know how to cooperate with the powerful, and the authorities happen to be corrupt. Once their power falls into the hands of the people, the hatred is extended to the British who cooperated with them. This is what Iran is like today. Now that the Tudeh Party has cooperated with the Soviet Union, its anti-British color is even stronger, which goes without saying. But according to him, Britain should take this as a warning and work hard to correct it, otherwise it will affect Britain's general reputation in the Middle East.</p>
<h3>Issue 136 of Soviet Forum Carries Article on Unpardonable Japanese War Crimes</h3>
<p>The main Japanese war criminals are currently on trial in Tokyo, judged by an international tribunal composed of representatives from the countries that signed the Japanese surrender terms. Those who instigated, led, and carried out such conspiracies will be subject to legal judgment.</p>
<p>The world is paying close attention to the exposure in Nuremberg of the horrific crimes of the Hitlerite leaders. Now, the top figures of Japanese imperialism, the organizers of aggression in the Far East, will also be judged by an international tribunal.</p>
<p>List of War Criminals: Japanese war criminals not only committed the crime of initiating the Pacific War, but even before that, their records show that they were the organizers and leaders of the invasion of China and the heads of the Japanese war machine.</p>
<p>The publicly released list of main Japanese war criminals includes former Japanese Prime Ministers Konoe, Koiso, Hirota, and Hiranuma; former Kwantung Army Commanders Umezu and Minami Jiro; former Foreign Ministers Matsuoka and Shigemitsu; and Tani Masayuki, as well as other leaders of the Japanese government and military. However, these lists are not complete, with many omissions, and many of those whom the countries that participated in defeating Japan demanded to be punished were not included in the list.</p>
<p>The Emperor Himself</p>
<p>The Emperor Question: The Emperor himself, setting aside his sacred imperial status, is traveling around the country giving publicity to his willingness to "serve democracy."</p>
<p>World opinion insists that Hirohito should be tried. Democratic Senator Roslow gave a speech in the Senate, demanding the arrest of the Emperor as a war criminal, which he was right to do. He pointed out that Hirohito is the heart of Japanese imperialism and one of the greatest aggressors in history. He also said: Because the Allies showed great respect for Hirohito, the Japanese people do not feel their defeat.</p>
<p>A group of prominent Filipinos jointly sent a telegram to President Truman, pointing out that reactionary forces intended to help the Emperor escape trial. Chinese newspapers emphasized that although Hirohito issued the surrender order and was temporarily retained to allow Allied forces to occupy Japan, his responsibility was not reduced as a result. Finally, even some Japanese newspapers hoped that the Allied headquarters would hand Hirohito over to the International Tribunal.</p>
<p>Kijuro Shidehara's Evasive Words</p>
<p>Although Shidehara reluctantly admitted that it was necessary to determine who was guilty of war crimes, they dramatically proclaimed: "He does not agree that these people deliberately started the war." Shidehara is very enthusiastic about helping war criminals evade responsibility.</p>
<p>He insisted: "There is no law that can be used as the basis for punishing those responsible for the war. Invoking such a new law is politically impermissible. If we must do this, then it constitutes a threat to the lives of our citizens. I believe that such a law could easily be abused by those who are politically powerful. We can use such laws to punish those who have failed politically. I believe that those guilty of war crimes should only be judged by public opinion."</p>
<p>When the order to arrest Prince Konoe was issued, Shidehara declared in the Diet: The government should not issue any statement on this matter.</p>
<p>Konoe and His Ilk: Konoe's suicide by poison can be considered a fitting death, allowing him to escape trial. Most government officials even attended Konoe's funeral. The Japanese police, who were ordered by MacArthur to arrest war criminals, gave many war criminals the opportunity to commit suicide calmly, thus escaping trial.</p>
<p>The occupying authorities have shown negligence in assigning the task of arresting war criminals to the Japanese police. Not only that, but according to the Associated Press, the US military headquarters also gave a group of war criminals three days of freedom to conclude their personal affairs. During this period, these war criminals were of course able to destroy all evidence and documents. Several war criminals were even granted various privileges for "commercial" reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, American newspapers reported that MacArthur decided to review the list of war criminals to determine whether further arrests were necessary. Moreover, the occupying authorities even released some war criminals before the trial began. Many of those in detention have had many opportunities to communicate with the outside world.</p>
<p>Mission of Atonement: Seeing the leniency and forgetfulness of the Allied countries, the Japanese government has devised a way to allow a group of war criminals to benefit. The Japanese government decided to send a "Mission of Atonement" to apologize and seek forgiveness from the countries that suffered during the war.</p>
<p>Shimada, the former Japanese Naval Minister who actively participated in the plan to attack Pearl Harbor, humbly told reporters that he went to Meiji Shrine every day to repent for his crimes.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Japanese government who directed the acts of aggression all pushed the blame onto the army, the army pushed it onto the navy, and the navy pushed it onto a group of dead people. When Tojo was arrested, he expressed extreme surprise and declared that he had tried his best to prevent the war, and that only Tojo himself was guilty of starting the war. Shortly before his suicide, Konoe argued that all his activities were for the purpose of peace, but these activities were obstructed by the warlords. In his will, this cunning old politician even tried to whitewash his own crimes. He wrote: "I have always wanted to cooperate with the United States to resolve Pacific affairs peacefully, but it is a pity that the United States has listed me as a war criminal.</p>
<p>Cunning Style</p>
<p>Tojo, who during his tenure as Prime Minister, followed the actions of the Hitlerite leaders step by step, is now using the same effort to imitate the cunning methods invented by a group of advanced comrades in the Nuremberg defendants' dock.</p>
<p>The Japan Times reported on March 27 that, according to authoritative sources: ". Tojo must lose his memory." During the interrogation, he could not "remember dates and other important details." Undoubtedly, during future interrogations, Japanese war criminals will maintain their consistent style of deception, evasion, and denial.</p>
<p>The Yamashita Case</p>
<p>The recent trial of Yamashita in Manila is clear proof. Although the prosecutor presented strong evidence and witnesses described the various atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers under the defendant's command in the Philippines, the defendant's lawyer appealed to the Philippine Supreme Court, requesting that Yamashita Tomoyuki be treated as a prisoner of war. These people who distort right and wrong even questioned the jurisdiction of the military commission that tried Yamashita Tomoyuki, arguing that such a trial violated the constitutions of the United States and the Philippines. Finally, they protested that Spain, which represents Japanese interests, had not received formal notice of the trial.</p>
<p>After all attempts failed, Yamashita appealed to the US Supreme Court. It was not until three months after the trial began that Yamashita received the final verdict and was executed by hanging. However, after Yamashita, General Homma, who was tried in Manila, had the opportunity to delay the case for a long time based on seemingly ambiguous legal technicalities. The lessons learned from the process of the trials that have already been held should be considered, and attention should be paid to the demands of various countries for the swift punishment of war criminals. Japanese fascists used the same weapons as the Hitlerites to imitate imperialism, seizing foreign territories, enslaving other countries, abolishing their independence, plundering the property of various countries, destroying all laws and customs of war, and abusing prisoners of war and the people of conquered countries - all of this was the same style in German imperialism and Japanese imperialism.</p>
<h3>Taitung Fishing Port: Suao</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mu Yun, Taitung Aviation News, 10th of this month</p>
<p>Judging from the terrain and actual conditions of Taitung, Suao — a small town located on the edge of the Pacific Ocean — is indeed the most excellent fishing port. It occupies a significant position in the total fish production of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Nanfangao, the center of the fishing port, is two kilometers from Suao. The reporter walked for three quarters of an hour in the hot weather. The district office has set up a village chief's office (township head) here, led by a village chief surnamed Huang. We visited the vitamin research factory established by the Japanese here using fish. It was bombed by American planes on March 21 last year, leaving only a ruin. The Health Bureau and higher authorities were unwilling to take over, leaving the local authorities to chew on the dregs.</p>
<p>The Japanese stored a large number of naval mines and aerial torpedoes in the mountain caves. There was a light railway line that meandered through the mountain caves, following the coastline and the cliffs to the town. On the water side of the small train line is a T-shaped inner harbor built artificially, made of cement, with a depth of two to three meters. Hundreds of motorized fishing boats and sailboats are docked here, as well as Japanese-style landing craft taken over by the naval department, thirty of which are docked in a row on the ocean.</p>
<p>From November to May, during these six months, the daily production is 600,000 Taiwan dollars. From June to October in the summer, because fish production is decentralized for sale, the daily production is 300,000 Taiwan dollars. There is a fisheries association with more than a hundred members, which handles matters related to fisheries. In the past, the Japanese allocated fishing gear to fish producers and issued subsidy bonuses to increase production. Now, the government's fisheries department has not yet thought of encouraging and subsidizing, but production has not decreased. This phenomenon seems abnormal, but it is actually very simple. The reason is that fish prices are high, which directly encourages them to increase production, enabling more than a thousand local people and five hundred Ryukyu residents who have been displaced to obtain a more stable life than in the Japanese era. (Regarding the Ryukyu residents, the reporter would like to report to the readers that there are 5,000 Ryukyu people in Taiwan. Like the gypsies of Europe, they live a nomadic life. Recently, they have felt serious unease, which is the rumor that their property will be confiscated. Some knowledgeable people say that it is a poisonous arrow released by the Japanese who were left in Taiwan for covert purposes, which is a terrible conspiracy.) The Taiwan Fisheries Company, with a capital of 50 million yuan, has a cold storage warehouse in Nanfangao, one of which can store 50 tons, and another in Suao with a daily production of 600 tons of freezing factory, and a canning factory with a monthly output of 5,000 boxes (the factory has been closed after the takeover), and the fishing equipment is very complete. The number one product is sailfish. Shark fins are the only seafood in the eyes of Shanghai people. It accounts for four-tenths of the total production in the province. The quality is better than that of Japanese production. A month ago, the selling price was 85 yuan per catty, but now it has soared to 400 yuan per catty, and there is still a shortage of goods.</p>
<p>Nanfangao is a harbor surrounded by mountains on three sides, artificially constructed, which is quite grand and suitable for sheltering from the wind and for concealment. However, because of the typhoon attack last year, many houses and public buildings were destroyed, and they have not yet been restored to their original state. A team of military police is stationed here to maintain law and order, so that the other side of the ocean has deeply smelled the atmosphere of mainland China. When the reporter sang "Fishermen are poor for generations" on the seaside under the moonlight, he had a different feeling about the government's "unlimited" indifference!</p>
<h3>Water Town Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Correspondent Wu Shouren, Suzhou, 12th of this month</p>
<p>Suzhou, the water town of Jiangnan, known as the Venice of the East, may be a very small point in the map of China, which covers one to two million square kilometers, but its tranquil and beautiful appearance is admired and envied by tens of millions of people from the north and south of the Yangtze River. Thinking of the popular saying "Above there is heaven, below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou," Suzhou must have a brilliant and glorious history.</p>
<p>Should Be Sowing: What to Buy Rice With to Exchange for Seeds</p>
<p>Along the Beijing-Shanghai line, Suzhou should always be considered a wealthy land of fish and rice, but today, this fortunate noun has become a fading trace and cannot be applied to the current Suzhou. The rice fields surrounding the city, covering more than 1.4 million mu, have an annual output of about 2.4 million shi of white rice. If distributed to a population of more than 1.3 million people, with the minimum needs of each person, there will still be a panic of 400,000 shi missing each year. What's more, this only food cannot be fully enjoyed by the people of Suzhou. In addition to the procurement of military food and the supply of local miscellaneous troops, there is also a large amount absorbed by huge grain loans. Although it is only a few months away from the autumn harvest, most of the tenant farmers have been threatened by famine. They were originally preparing food to get through the period between harvests, but gun purchase fees, self-defense donations, etc. forced them to sell their limited food reserves. In an instant, the price of rice soared to more than 40,000 yuan. The fields should also be sown, and everyone is worried: What to buy rice with? What to exchange for seeds?</p>
<p>Material Theft Suspects: Actually Escaped from Prison</p>
<p>The warehouses left by the enemy are densely distributed in the suburbs. They have been sealed, stored, and guarded since September last year, but there is still no news of any disposal. "Starving people fill the roads," although still an exaggerated phrase, "rice rotting in the granary" is the most accurate. In February of this year, a case of dereliction of duty involving theft was exposed. The warehouse manager of Xikuatang colluded with his subordinates to continuously steal a large amount of materials. Although this matter was discovered and investigated by the competent authorities, it actually allowed the main criminal to escape through the window while in custody. The result was that it ended without a conclusion. The unlucky ones were the common people who sold the stolen goods, who are said to still be imprisoned. They became the scapegoat for the criminals.</p>
<p>The Suzhou news industry is also not as lively as before the war. Currently, the newspapers in circulation are Suzhou Mingbao, Su Bao, Suzhou Daily, Lixing Daily, Dinhua Bao, and Dajiangnan Bao, a total of six newspapers. Except for Dajiangnan Bao, which is a small-sized newspaper published three times a month, the others are three large-sized daily newspapers and two small-sized daily newspapers. There is only competition in business and news between them, and little attention is paid to the improvement of their own organizations. Therefore, the strength of the news front is scattered. Unlike other places where there is fierce competition in work, but a valuable harmony is maintained in spirit, in the past February, the news workers themselves initiated the organization of the News Reporters Friendship Association. Only three preparatory meetings were held, and the fourth meeting was stillborn, and it has not been established to this day. The only existing news organization is the Newspaper Association, which is the only news industry organization independently organized by the publishers of five daily newspapers.</p>
<p>Piles of Garbage: Seemingly Forming Small Hills</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is about the garbage in Suzhou. If a foreigner wants to inquire about Suzhou's specialties, the reporter can answer him without hesitation: "Garbage." This is Suzhou's historical specialty. Piled up at the ends of every street and alley, or in open spaces, seemingly forming piles of small hills. In the past, it has been repeatedly cleaned up using Japanese prisoners of war, but cleanliness could not be maintained for more than three days. The reason is of course that the destination is not prosperous. In fact, hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers surrounding the city need it to be used as fertilizer. However, the demands and difficulties in transportation make the honest tenant farmers dare not try. Each scavenger or local bully arbitrarily identifies a section of land, and the garbage within this section is their property. They refuse to let others transport it casually without payment, and they themselves do not find ways to sell and dispose of it, so they accumulate it there to wait for a good price. Whenever the weather is clear, the wind blows and stirs up a large cloud of dust everywhere. In this cloud of dust, we seem to be watching this tranquil and beautiful Suzhou, a water town in Jiangnan, falling behind day by day, day by day. Separated from the beautiful and ideal realm.</p>
<h3>Going South by Driving the Chariot North · Self-Contained System: Two Worlds of Korea</h3>
<p>According to Koreans who have moved from northern Korea to the American zone in the south: Today's Korea is actually divided into two countries, possessing two different political and economic systems.</p>
<p>The American occupation zone is governed by the US military government led by Major General Lerch. The government was established in September 1945, immediately after the American occupation forces landed in Korea. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, once said: The American plan is to gradually transfer all administrative and executive powers to the Koreans when they are capable of doing so in Korea.</p>
<p>Korean Autonomy: Expected to be Realized Soon</p>
<p>In the past few months, this ability of the Koreans has been quite strong. Major General Lerch said in an interview with the Associated Press that he believed that Koreans would soon be able to take over all government agencies. Later, he also said that he believed that the Koreans were ready for autonomy and hoped that they would be able to become a reality soon.</p>
<p>According to a recent announcement by the military government: The transfer of government power is actually in progress and is progressing rapidly. For several months, there have been two directors in each bureau of the government, and many other important positions have dual officials: one American and one Korean. In fact, in most bureaus, the position of the American is purely advisory, and the Korean officials are doing the actual work.</p>
<p>Like a Pyramid: Establishing a Civil Service System</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, General Hodge explained the purpose of the United States in Korea. He compared the Korean government to a pyramid. He said: The Americans are building the pyramid from the bottom up, laying a solid foundation for the civil service system, so that when the provisional government and the final independent government are established, the leaders of the government can stand securely on the pyramid without the danger of collapsing.</p>
<p>The military government, following Hodge's policy, specially established a civil service system suitable for the Korean political system. It promulgated a decree last month stipulating that government officials must pass a civil service examination to completely overthrow the Japanese system of appointment by the Japanese Emperor. The Korean civil service system is completely based on the American civil service system, and the actual organizational matters are presided over by the American civil service chief. All positions are based on performance as the standard for retention. Current officials, as long as they can pass the examination or their qualifications and abilities are considered satisfactory by senior officials, have the hope of retaining their positions.</p>
<p>Five Northern Provinces: The Situation of Soviet Takeover</p>
<p>But in northern Korea, the government system under the Soviet Union presents a completely different picture. When the Soviet Union occupied northern Korea, the People's Committee was established there, taking over the Korean administrative organs after the Japanese surrender. This kind of organization also existed within the American occupation zone. When the United States announced that the military government was the only ruling body recognized by the United States, the Soviet Union took over these committees for its own use. According to the Koreans, they often changed the leaders and administrative heads, but the body of the organization remained unchanged.</p>
<p>This situation has created a situation that allows the Soviet Union to have an excuse to say that Korea is ruled by the Provisional People's Committee, while the United States can only say that they are laying the foundation for a permanent government. The government in the north is based in Pyongyang, the second largest city and industrial center in Korea. The American government is located in Seoul, the ancient capital of Korea. The American authorities have taken over the Korean government, while the Soviet Union has only taken over the government of the five northern provinces.</p>
<p>The North and South Zones: Almost Run Counter to Each Other</p>
<p>The leaders of the Communist Party in southern and northern Korea have fully utilized the so-called "one people" government. In fact, this government is predetermined. According to the Koreans, important positions are occupied by Communist Party members, and anti-Communists are absolutely not allowed to hold administrative positions. Politically, the north and south zones are almost running counter to each other. The Americans allow all parties (from Communists to anarchists) to participate in politics. But the Soviet Union, through the People's Committee under the control of the Communist Party, only supports the Communist Party and excludes all other parties. Within the American zone, there are currently 150 registered parties, of which five parties are relatively important. But in the Soviet zone, there are only the Communist Party, the left-wing People's Party, and the Democratic Party. The latter, due to the impact of political and social changes, cannot continue to operate in northern Korea and has moved its headquarters to Seoul.</p>
<p>Similarly, in terms of economy, the situation in the north and south zones is also completely different. The American army only took over the banks and currency, but according to the Koreans, the Soviet army forcibly occupied the banks and issued its own military notes. In the American zone, political parties adopted a land reform policy to sell land to farmers. But in the north, the Communist Party wants to confiscate the land and give it to the farmers.

<h3>Truly Going to Fight?</h3>
<p>— Liao Yuan</p>
<p>I am an ordinary citizen without party affiliation, standing in an objective position. I want to say something directly to the point: the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and other parties, along with the powerful officials, are all serving the common people. To put it bluntly, the country belongs to us, the people. Your parties and those in power are public servants of the people, meant to create happiness for the people, not to play around with us. You must recognize your responsibilities and not assume that just because you have guns, the country and the people are your possessions. Of course, it would be great if you could negotiate well. But if you can't, and guns are pitted against guns, cannons against cannons, who suffers in the end but the common people? Frankly speaking, you are toying with the people. It's pitiful that the people's voices have no effect anymore. We don't want you to fight, yet you insist on opening fire. Doesn't this mean the people have no sovereignty? What democracy are we even talking about? We, the weak and helpless common people, have only one request: please don't fight! Let the people have a few days of peace, and let the country catch its breath. Our country has been embroiled in civil war for over twenty years and fought against the Japanese invaders for eight more. We are already exhausted. Finally, with the government's leadership, the external threats have been eliminated. This is the time for national construction and for the people to rest. How can we possibly tolerate internal strife again? Even if you each have powerful backers, I ask you, what good does it do for our country and our people? Fighting back and forth, isn't it just a case of two clams fighting, benefiting the fisherman? Isn't Spain a good example for us? Do you perhaps want to turn the country into a graveyard and make us, the people, into corpse-guarding ghosts? Our people's demand for a ceasefire and peace is as good as nothing. We have to rely on our allies to mediate and run around to bring about some result. It's such a shameful thing that our domestic affairs have to be managed by outsiders! Our people shout until their throats are sore, but it's like a drop in the bucket, completely ineffective. The people don't want you to fight, yet you insist on fighting. We, the people, can only call out to Heaven, and only Heaven knows our suffering. We endured eight years of the War of Resistance, shedding blood and suffering hardship, finally hoping that the Japanese devils would surrender so we could return to our hometowns. Who would have thought that not only could we not go home, but prices are even higher than during the war, making it impossible for us to survive? We heard that there was a ceasefire and that transportation was restored. We were overjoyed, dancing with happiness. But who knew that the good times wouldn't last? We heard that fighting had broken out again everywhere, that transportation was disrupted again, and that the ceasefire order was no longer effective, leaving us, the displaced people, with no other option but to shed a few hot tears. But we, the people, still hope that you powerful officials who wield guns will have the heart of a Bodhisattva and have pity on us, the people! Please don't fight anymore. If both sides truly launch a full-scale civil war, we, the people, standing in an objective position, will not lean towards either side. You are all Chinese; we will see who treats us, the people, better. Fight, fight, fight, we, the people, will watch you fight!</p>
<p>Relieving the Grain Shortage — Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Recently, famine has continued in various parts of the country, rice and food are scarce, and starving people are migrating. The situation is severe, and cries for help are rising everywhere. Socially conscious people are thinking of good ways to remedy the situation. Some advocate food rationing, others advocate thrift, and so on. The food rationing policies in Europe and the United States have been implemented and can greatly solve the food shortage problem. However, China's current household registration system is not good, and transportation is not smooth, so it is feared that good results may not be achieved. Although frugality is a passive method, it may still be helpful if implemented properly. Poor families have already tightened their belts and practiced complete frugality. The problem lies only with the wealthy. They must have fish and meat with every meal, and they must eat until they are full before they stop. This is simply too extravagant! We want to ask them to show great kindness, save food, and save their compatriots who are on the line of death. At the same time, the government should urgently use newspapers and radio stations to promote frugality, and immediately implement compulsory frugality measures, such as strictly prohibiting the use of rice to brew wine, make pastries, and prohibiting diners from eating and drinking excessively in restaurants and hotels. Guangxi once vigorously promoted frugality. When the local authorities opened wine shops and restaurants, they sent military police to monitor their operations. If they found diners eating more than the regulations allowed, they would be punished according to law. As a result, the habit of eating excessively gradually decreased. In short, governance depends on people. If the government is determined to implement it vigorously and formulate laws that are appropriate for the situation, there is no reason why it will not be effective.</p>
<p>Reading the essays in Ta Kung Pao and Shen Bao, wise men and scholars have expressed their views, such as selecting food, paying attention to quality, and seeking to obtain rich nutrients, and paying attention to eating methods, intending to make food easy to digest and absorb, all of which are good suggestions. At the same time, I feel that our country's cooking methods mostly seek to satisfy taste, without paying attention to nutrition, discarding or retaining things and whether they are easy to digest, which is not in line with scientific principles. The matter must be studied and improved by various health agencies and food nutritionists. The United States has already achieved results in researching and improving the cooking method of rice. Looking back at our country, which has always been known as a rice-eating country, no one has paid attention to improvement. It is embarrassing to say, do we only know how to enjoy the achievements of others? Stewing and steaming vegetables are not advisable, frying is better because the loss of nutrients is less. Secondly, the ingredients can also be reduced. This does not greatly affect the taste of the vegetables, but it can save food. Advanced scholars should study cooking methods, and draw up several menus for compatriots, detailing the cooking methods, widely disseminate them, and guide people to adopt them. If we can do this, it is expected that part of the difficulties of the food shortage can be resolved.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Grand Occasion of Listening to Music</h3>
<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>Music is one of the six arts, connected to literature and art above, and in harmony with opera and drama below. As Zixia said, "Words are not enough to express it, therefore we lengthen them; lengthening words is not enough, therefore we sing and sigh; singing and sighing is not enough, therefore we dance with our hands and stomp with our feet." Therefore, Yao struck the chime-stones and the hundred beasts danced together. Shun played the five-stringed zither and sang the "Ode to the Southern Wind," and the world was at peace. Confucius, after hearing the Shao music, did not taste meat for three months. Its power to move people is beyond what words can convey. Since the demise of elegant music and the rise of foreign music, our people's power of assimilation has been stronger than that of any other nation. Therefore, before long, the Qiang flute, the Hu Jia, the Pipa, and the Sanxian became as important as the Qin, Se, Sheng, and Zheng. In the Tang Dynasty's Ten Parts of Music, elegant music occupied only one position, while the others were mostly music from Liangzhou, Yizhou, Gaochang, and even India, brought in from the Western Regions. Because of the love of music by Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, and Emperor Huizong of Song, there were great masters such as Li Yannian, Li Yannian, Kang Kunlun, Huang Fancho, and Zhou Bangyan, as well as peerless beauties such as Lady Li, Zhao Feiyan, Yang Yuhuan, and Li Shishi. That period was the golden age of Chinese music. How glorious and magnificent! Hearing about it a thousand years later still makes one's heart stir. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, music has gradually declined. With the loss of ritual, we seek it in the wild. Hence, the invention of the Yuan Dynasty's new drama and the Ming Dynasty's Kunqu opera were enough to slightly revive the declining trend. Since the opening of the seas, the people of our country have been obsessed with Europe and America, and Western music has flourished, no longer knowing that there is national music. Those so-called musicians seem to think that carrying a violin and playing a saxophone is enough to fulfill their capabilities. The saxophone and violin are certainly good, but they do not think from the perspective of our own culture. They absorb foreign cultures, abandoning their own, and only value the West, even considering China to have no music, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Shanghai National Music Research Association, at this time of uncertainty, have gathered comrades to study national music, to turn back the tide when it is about to fall, and to seek out what is about to be lost. Having been established for ten years, they have performed many times, and their reputation has long been spread both at home and abroad. In particular, the president, Mr. Sun Yude, has devoted himself to research for thirty years, having unique secrets in national music, and adopting the strengths of others with a humble heart, which is even more commendable. The other day, in response to an invitation from the Friends of the Military Association, they gave a public performance to慰劳 the soldiers who had fought hundreds of battles and to celebrate the commemoration of the return to the capital. This reporter was fortunate enough to attend the event, a feast for the ears, and cannot but record it.</p>
<p>That evening, they played "Remembering the Past," "Han Xin Conquers Chu," "Sword Dance," and "High Moon." "Remembering the Past" is a Zhongyuan string music that was transmitted to Dabu, Guangdong. It is a work of inspiration at the time. It is played by all ten instruments in unison. The interlude is desolate and has a deep sense of emotion. It is played by southerners, which adds a delicate and undulating feeling. It is the combination of the strengths of the north and the south. Next was Mr. Sun Yude's Pipa solo, its name being "Han Xin Conquers Chu". Marquis of Huaiyin, Han Xin, trapped the Hegemon-King of Chu at Gaixia with his ambushing plan of Ambush from Ten Sides, the Hegemon-King, with his earth-shattering appearance, was defeated and committed suicide at the Wujiang River. This tune is the same story as "The Hegemon-King Disarms" (also known as 四輪袍). "The Hegemon-King Disarms" tells the story of the Hegemon-King's tragic defeat, especially the part where he bids farewell to his concubine, which is even more poignant (Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine is based on this). This tune, however, describes the victory of the Han army. The story is both tragic and heroic, and Mr. Sun Yude's fingerwork is especially skilled. He can play various sounds on the Pipa strings. At first, the bugles and horns sound together, the three armies line up, the generals are appointed and the soldiers are dispatched, and the teams are ambushed. Then the battle begins, the shouting shakes the sky, and amidst the stampede of ten thousand horses, drum sounds are interspersed. Finally, the formation is defeated, they break through the siege, and flee hastily, ending with a sharp sound that stops abruptly, making the listener feel as if they are in the battlefield, witnessing the bloody battle of the two armies. It is truly a divine skill. The next performance was Mr. Ye Dami and Miss Bingru's sword dance, accompanied by Pipa, Jinghu, Sheng, and Xiao four musical instruments. Mr. Ye is said to be the true heir of General Li Jinglin. His swordsmanship is of the Wudang school, and he has already deeply entered the realm. His inner strength is profound, and his thrust is especially miraculous. Miss Bingru's swordsmanship is also exquisite. The two dance together, gently undulating, each reaching their best. They are sometimes as agile as swimming dragons, sometimes as light as startled swans, both bold and agile, heroic and transcendent. I did not see the sword dance of Lady Gongsun, but I have already been fascinated by watching Wang Xichun's sword dance in Hanga during an enemy air raid, and I wrote a long poem to record it, which was widely spread. Now seeing Mr. Ye and Miss Sword Dance is even more magical and extraordinary. No wonder Zhang Dian saw Lady Gongsun's sword dance and became a master of cursive script. The finale was "High Moon". "!!!" is another name for the Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress. Some say that the Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress was the music that the Taoist Ye Fashan heard when he led Emperor Xuanzong of Tang to tour the Moon Palace, while others say that it was the Brahman music presented by Yang Jingshu, the Tang Hexi Jiedushi. The former is closer to mythology, while the latter may be more credible, because the Brahman music came from the Western Liang and was adapted by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. This music has songs and dances, and it was probably taught to the Liyuan disciples after being adapted by Emperor Xuanzong. The reason why this music is named so is because Consort Yang Yuhuan loved this music and also personally created the Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress Dance to please Emperor Xuanzong. With the rendering of Bai Juyi's Song of Everlasting Regret, the romance of Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei immediately floats into the mind when mentioning the preface to Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress. This music was lost by the Song Dynasty. Jiang Baishi once supplemented a stanza of Sanxu. Recently, Professor Wu Meicun obtained a solitary copy, which turned out to be a complete set, and personally taught it at the Southeast University Affiliated High School and the First Women's Normal School. This evening was a musical performance by the entire orchestra, not a song and dance, so there are still shortcomings in discussing the preface to Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress, but the skill of the performance has been able to convey the events in this story, as if one were in the Tang Palace. This music should only be found in heaven, how many times can one hear it in the world? After the performance, the entire audience applauded for three minutes without stopping, demanding another encore. But after a while, the music ended and the people disappeared, inevitably causing disappointment. Listening to the true music of the Rainbow Skirt in the sky, the wind and dew are unbearable on the way back, which is used as the finale of this music.</p>
<h3>The Annamese's Horn</h3>
<p>— Zhang Luo</p>
<p>"DA, DA DA..." The horn of the Annamese people in the Shanghai Overseas Annamese Association, my neighbor, is sounding again. The east has just turned white, when the wandering thoughts of the classmates in the dormitory are still lingering in the "Spring Dream Garden."</p>
<p>This monotonous, weak, and even desolate horn is sounding endlessly and regularly every day, whether you are in class, reading and writing, taking a walk in the garden after class, or lying on the bed under the lamp, lost in thought.</p>
<p>It disrupts our work and disturbs our peace, but we have no right or even reason to stop it. Because, as the Annamese people say, this is also their homework—it is the representative of the Annamese people, the voice of the Annamese people—the voice of all Annamese people!</p>
<p>Helplessly, the classmates came up with a way to deal with it, which is to spit on the ground as soon as it sounds again, to express a kind of spiritual disgust and curse for it.</p>
<p>This day was even worse. Several horns started blaring together, just as we were having English class; and joining in were several drum sounds. These things were blowing and beating together in a mess. This cursed sound was like loss and sorrow; like accusation and injustice. At the same time, if you listened carefully, you could also hear a series of solemn, sad, and intense farewell tunes mixed in...</p>
<p>This day ruined one of our classes. Most of the classmates only spat three times before stopping, because it blew and beat continuously for an hour. As a result, the classmates elected me as their representative and decided to walk over the courtyard wall and negotiate with them.</p>
<p>I went, and the negotiation went like this:</p>
<p>"Friends!" On the parade ground, I stopped a short Annamese drummer and asked him in French.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I can't welcome you to speak to me in French!" He answered me in Chinese with reproach and kindness, solemnly.</p>
<p>I felt ashamed and embarrassed, and then asked:</p>
<p>"What is this for today?" I also spoke Chinese, pointing to the horns and drums that were placed aside, and the group of drummers squatting beside them.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He called out, "Now I can talk to you, even though we have wasted a lot of effort on you... Now we are aware: we will take all the remaining strength back and blow it there, where we believe it can arouse resistance and help! Friends, are we saying goodbye tomorrow? Just now was a farewell to you..."</p>
<p>After coming back, I wandered around the campus, savoring these words carefully. Soon, I understood the monotonous, weak, and even desolate sound, and the solemn, sad, and intense farewell tune that I had not been able to understand before...</p>
<p>Yes, we have foolishly misused many precious strengths of others. In our country, apart from only knowing how to watch people fight for democracy as if watching a play, and using disgust to deal with friends' requests for help and urging, there is nothing else.</p>
<p>After thinking, I wanted to tell everyone what I had experienced and thought, so that they could also understand the Annamese people's horns and its sound, and further promote their actions to make up for the disappointment of friends towards us, but they are leaving tomorrow...</p>
<p>Yes, they are leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow, the so-called Shanghai Overseas Annamese Association will leave behind the three empty and prison-like Western houses and a parade ground like a desolate tomb. And the Annamese people, our dear brothers, will leave these behind and run to the embrace of their homeland, which is small but knows how to resist and help...</p>
<h3>Night Inscription on Grass</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>At night, I dipped my haggard soul in silence, calling for dreamlike shadows. My thoughts, like a tired pug, lay at my feet, a past memory floating to the surface of my heart.</p>
<p>Under the small window, the green lamp accompanies the silence—thinking of your history, warming your old dreams, what is there? A trace of sweetness that has passed, a little tranquility; in the alley, there are lonely night travelers, their footsteps tapping on the stone slabs, so the waves spread on the sea of night, and the heart expands in circles in all directions; it is also like slowly expanding from the focus of a snail-shell-like spiral, gradually greening the unfolding marks, lengthening the journey of life. A few poetic sentiments of the night, a few memories; tracing back the old dreams of the past, scarlet and golden, chewing them like an olive.</p>
<p>The contemplation of the night carries you further away.</p>
<p>In the desolate countryside, there is no trace of anyone at the ferry crossing. In the blossoming month of March, carrying a simple pack, traversing one mountain, then wading through a river, the roads at night are mostly rugged, a distant spark of fire, is it a lamp light or a will-o'-the-wisp? The night wind howls as it sweeps across the wilderness. When fatigue weighs down the legs, the dawn appears on the horizon, and the red halo of the sunlight rises into the brightness of the daytime.</p>
<p>In the ancient city, we meet and want to know each other, you hold up your clever wisdom, so you leave me with a good memory. In the mountain city, the ancient city walls, the spring dusk, are covered with the remnants of the sun, a white cloud in the blue sky covers the distant poplars, in the small river. The setting sun scatters golden light, white chickens swim close, the round, water-like ripples are hidden in the green grass. The chickens' toes tap on the surface of the water, creating a series of notes, you say, this is time, this is true beauty. A wild flower, abandoned, is gently picked up by you in the forest. So you think of the flower-thrower, you say, this flower is smeared with love and hate. Finally, on a moonless night, you put on a grass-green coat, and then walked out alone, recognizing the breath and color of the night.</p>
<p>There is no sadness at parting, you only say a low "goodbye", I only watch your back disappear into the atmosphere of the night, at that time, who can appreciate whether the occasional separation is sweet or bitter? ...... Now, five years have passed, but this small city, should also make you nostalgic?</p>
<p>In the distance, there are green mountains, there are green waters, and a beautiful environment for you, but do you still remember your old friend from thousands of miles away?</p>
<p>The night is still so quiet. I take out a photo of you, which you gave me as a memento, from a page in a book with a red leaf pressed between the pages, and stare at it. Suddenly, it makes me seem to faintly yearn for your grass-green coat, which is always a silent shadow.</p>
<p>Fatigue lowers my eyelids, but I don't want to sleep. I press my hand on my chest, faintly, but heavily, I hear the beating of my own heart.</p>
<p>The lamp shakes off the weariness of the long night, and letters from people in the distance are spread out on the table.</p>
<p>The century is long!</p>

<h3>Harvest</h3>
<p>— Chen Gange</p>
<p>The dim sunset, facing the high-hanging rosy clouds, in the early autumn of Jiangnan, still tries to radiate its weak remaining power. But the farmers seem not to have noticed that dusk has begun to envelop the earth, still bending down, barefoot; the men naked to the waist, rolling up their trousers; the women wearing very thin clothes, holding sickles in their hands, cutting and cutting, letting the bean-sized sweat droplets slide from the corners of their foreheads to their mouths, then flow to their necks, and then flow to their chests, before dripping little by little into the soil.</p>
<h3>Twin Flight (36)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>The Second Madam Weng no longer carries the surname Weng, but we might as well still call her Second Madam Weng. It suffices for us to know that she has become the wife of Shi Wanglou.</p>
<p>Since Second Madam Weng eloped with Shi Yulou to Beijing, she has lived in an apartment in the Xichenggen area.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou still performs, but he is not as famous as he was in Jingzhou. Beijing is a place where famous actors congregate, and Shi Yulou can only be ranked as a third-rate actor. Wealthy people go to listen to Xun Huisheng's huashan opera; those without money listen to the Fuliancheng opera school, which is also passable.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou still smokes opium, and he smokes it even more heavily. Like Master Weng, he sleeps during the day and performs on stage at night. He hardly has time to talk or play with Second Madam Weng, leaving her still living a lonely and desolate life.</p>
<p>As time went on, Second Madam Weng felt that Shi Yulou was not as considerate and indulgent as Master Weng. Shi Yulou was never much of a talker, but now he is even more silent, often not saying a word from morning to night. When Second Madam Weng asked him something, he would nod to indicate agreement and shake his head to indicate disagreement. Within this "agreement" and "disagreement," there were more disagreements. Because Shi Yulou was quite stubborn, he did what he wanted, and Second Madam Weng had to go along with him. But Shi Yulou did not necessarily go along with what Second Madam Weng wanted. Shi Yulou had a prejudice against Second Madam Weng in his heart, perhaps he had such a prejudice against all women! He believed that the reason Second Madam Weng tormented Master Weng in the first place was because Master Weng was too compliant with her. Now, he was determined not to follow in Master Weng's footsteps. Therefore, he constantly used Master Weng's past to warn himself. Of course, he also had ways to please Second Madam Weng, unlike Master Weng, who could only make her disgusted. For example, Shi Yulou's art, Shi Yulou's youth, and Shi Yulou's appearance—it was precisely because of these things that Second Madam Weng was willing to endure the unhappiness that Shi Yulou gave her. Moreover, Second Madam Weng was simply reverting to her original nature, which was timidity.</p>
<p>When Second Madam Weng learned of Master Weng's death, she quietly shed a few tears of mourning. She thought that Master Weng's suicide was for her sake, and she was saddened! She repented! But then she thought that if she had not left, if she had stayed with Master Weng and lived such a gloomy life, it would not have been a good outcome either. So she forgave herself again. This issue caused her contradictory pain! And this pain was only buried in her heart, she could not express it, and there was no one to tell! During this period, she thought of Madam Mo. She remembered that ten years ago, when she was abandoned by Master Weng in Jingzhou, it was Madam Mo who saved her during that most painful period, and Madam Mo taught her to be strong. Later, when Master Weng surrendered to her, it was Madam Mo who told her how to take revenge on Master Weng. Now, it seemed that Shi Yulou was taking revenge on her for Master Weng, and she feared that Shi Yulou would also abandon her one day like Master Weng. Therefore, she was very lost! She needed Madam Mo to support her again, and at the same time, she still needed Madam Mo to accompany her loneliness in life. So, she wrote a letter inviting Madam Mo to come to Beijing.</p>

<h3>Tracking Down Missing Persons</h3>
<h3>A Grieving Mother Longs for Her Son's Return</h3>
<p>In Shanghai's Xujiahui, there lives an elderly widow, Madam Lu, originally from Zhuji, who raised her son with proper guidance, and is praised by all. Her only son, Lu Chaobin, also known as Ruiyun, received training in the Guiyang army before the August 13th Incident and later joined the air force. Initially, there were letters from home, but later Madam Lu was not at home. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), an urgent letter was sent, but the neighbors did not receive it on her behalf, nor did they stamp the return slip, so the letter was returned. Since then, there has been no news. His father served as a coach for the Shanghai West Security Corps before the August 13th Incident and was killed by the enemy. Now, more than half a year has passed since the victory, and the aging Madam Lu leans on the door panel every day, longing for her son's return. Her situation is very tragic. We earnestly request that officers and colleagues who know about his life or death please send a letter to Madam Lu at No. 21 Zhaoxiang Lane, Tianyao Bridge, Xujiahui, Shanghai, or to Lu Cuie in Shanglu Town, Dongyang, Zhejiang.</p>

<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<h3>Cheng Zhuanxiang Asks:</h3>
<p>My younger sister, Zhou Wenying, is 18 years old. When she was young, her parents arranged a marriage with her aunt's son (a cousin). Now that they are both adults, the cousin is dull and unattractive. For the sake of her future, she does not want to marry him. However, under the old etiquette and feudal ideology, although she has protested several times in words, she cannot open the minds of her stubborn parents. To avoid a life of misery, the woman has decided to dissolve the engagement. What procedures should she follow to get rid of it? I would be grateful for your guidance.</p>
<h3>[Reply by Lawyer Cao Yaxia]</h3>
<p>Our Civil Code stipulates that "marriage contracts should be made by the man and woman themselves," and "men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen may not enter into marriage contracts." Therefore, a marriage arranged by her parents when she was young is naturally invalid and does not give rise to the issue of dissolution. Miss Zhou is now eighteen years old, not yet an adult, and if she has not consented to the marriage contract, she is naturally not bound by it, nor is it necessary to express her intention to dissolve the marriage contract. Moreover, the performance of a marriage contract cannot be enforced. If she is determined not to marry the other party in the future, even if her parents are stubborn, they cannot force her to perform it.</p>
