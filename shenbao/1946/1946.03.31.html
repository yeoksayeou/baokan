<p>〔本報濟南卅日電〕頃悉某方人士談稱：山東省境鐵路修復工程，如照政府原定計劃進行，截至目前止，南可修至兗州，北達德州，東至濰縣。因受共軍不斷提出新問題之影響，工程時斷時續，迄今修復地段，總計尙不足二十公里，至於材料方面，照路局原擬預算最多損失百分之二十左右，惟事實上情形則反是。自恢復修路至今，共軍撤卸收存之鋼軌枕木，及其他器材，始終未能交出絲毫，是以將來修復工程繼續進行時，器材缺乏，依然是個大問題。</p>

<p>原來吾國人口四分之三以上爲農民，農業問題實爲整個經濟問題之焦點，而土地問題之解決，尤爲解決農業問題之先決條件。中國歷代內亂與革命，其主要原因也多爲農民生活不安引起暴動之結果。孟子說：「夫仁政必自經界始，經界不正，土地不均，榖祿不平，是故暴君汚吏，必漫其經界，經界旣正，分田制祿，可坐而定焉。」這雖是封建時代的話，但他的眞知灼見，已將土地問題之重要性闡揚無遺。要之，土地間題之解決，向爲吾國歷代所重視，解決得法，則人民相安無事，而社會安定，反是則亂。八年抗戰，舉國上下，鑑於吾國輕重工業未能及早建立，因之枉費許多慘重代價，經長期之犧牲，方能得到最後勝利，此種現實敎訓，迫使朝野上下舉國一致，凛悟於戰後中國必需工業化。但須知工業化基礎必需建築在廣大農業之上，然後工業原料的來源方不貧乏，而工業成品亦有廣大農市塲可以傾銷。倘若土地間題不能合理解決，農業生產不能增加，農邨不能安定與繁榮，大部分農民購買力薄弱異常，則不獨所謂「工業化」將爲空中樓閣，無所憑藉，而且放任部分工商業畸形發展之結果，接踵便會發生原料與市塲之爭奪問題，引起更大危機，甚至使國家走錯途徑，釀成禍隨，一如日本之往事。華萊士氏說過：「美國的雄厚工業力量，原是建築在廣大農村之上。」値茲建國伊始，百廢待舉，政府正在籌謀長治久安之大計，重提美國前副總統這句名言，當有甚深之意義。任何一種土地制度，必有其時間性與空間性。在某一國家實行有效之制度，換在叧一國家，未必有效；同樣，在某一時代成效卓著之制度，換在另一時代實施，也許可能得到相反的結果。所以研究解決土地問題的方法，自不能墨守古人成規，或徒襲外國皮毛，强古今中外而歸於一轍。然而一國土地問題之發生，必有其歷史淵源與背景，而解決土地問題方法之是否適當，亦莫不與其現實環境與世界潮流有關。因此，要硏討解決我國常前的農村土地問題，先簡單回溯一下歷史與參放國際一般趨勢與傾向，當屬必要。</p>
<p>吾國歷史悠長，土地問題發生亦最早。周代倡井田之制，孟子說：「方里爲井，井九百畝，其中爲公田，八家皆私百畝，共養養公田，」井田制的要義即在此。降及春秋戰國，人丁更繁，豪强兼併風起，土地因私有而生產能力大增。秦商鞅因勢利便，遂廢井田之制，於是土地可公開自由買賣，而地主與商人階級接踵崛興，馴致有田者不耕，能耕者無田，貧富懸殊，社會不安。嗣後歷代執政者遂多以全力注意土地分配問題。漢董仲舒之限田制，王莽之王田制，晋武帝之占田制，魏孝文帝之均田制，唐之班田制，宋太祖之均田法，多是相當的承認土地公有而以計口授旧爲分配方法（細節常然不同），目的則在獎勵生產，防杜兼併之前提下，兼謀國家稅收之增益。於此有一趨勢可以注意，即各種田制之調整，往往多在鼎革之際，値大亂之後，人口流亡，農田荒蕪之時，蓋計口授田，有二大前提，一須戶籍調查淸楚，二須有充裕耕地足以配給，而大亂之後，人丁稀少，陸續安撫來歸，容易調査，且荒蕪之農田，與奪自敵方秩序下之土地，可以重行分配供應不缺，所以施行新制之初，無不見效。至於各種制度之破壞，則多發生於承平日久，人口滋繁，豪强逐漸兼併，土地不够分配之時會。物不平則嗚，於是農民騷動，秩序破壞，引起變亂，結果則換一朝代，重新又將土地調整一番，週而復始，循環到今。這是從前中國歷史一治一亂的最大原因。</p>
<p>密邇民國之太平天國，亦嘗實行授田制度，其方法係按生產量將田地劃分好壞九等，受田者不論性別，依人數多寡而分配，每家優劣田各半，不得參差。所謂「天下之田，天下人同耕，此處不足，則遷彼處，彼處不足，則遷此處。又天下田荒豐相通，此處荒，則移彼豐處，以賑此荒處，彼處荒，則移此豐處，以賑彼荒處。其目的在有田同耕，有飯同吃，有衣同穿，有錢同使，無人不均勻，無人不飽暖，」是於「公土地」以外，復有「均貧富」之辦法，用意深遠。惜乎天國建制不久，而且失敗以後，各種典章文物，均被淸代澈底消滅，蕩然無存，所以其詳細方法與施行成果，除由各種零星記載可以搜集部份資料外，殆已不易窺其全貌。</p>
<p>世界上沒有一個國家不發生土地問題，不渦其問題嚴重的程度，必與人口多寡，土地供應，以及分配制度成相當的比例。假如人口少，土地多（如熟帶南北極非洲等處），根本不致發生問題。如果人人雖多，而天然土地供應無缺，或能以人爲努力和科學方法擴充耕地面積，增加生產，則縱有問題，也不會如何深刻。假若人烟稠密，耕地狹小，分配制度又不合理，那便最爲嚴重。談到各國解決土地問題的方法，因歷史不同，國情各別，自多歧異，然就整個趨勢觀察，大別可歸納爲二大範疇：第一種爲澈底廢除土地私有制，完全收回國有，採行集體農塲制度，以科學方法大規模經營，使農業經營工業化，如蘇聯所實行者；第二種爲相當的承認土地私有權，惟以法律限制管理，使分配比較合理，以减輕壟斷兼併之弊，如愛爾蘭，以及東歐諸國所施行者。第一種公田制度，原與中國歷代理想相吻合，加上現代化技術經營（此點爲歷代所無），第二種制度，吾躋土地法中亦有扶植自耕農以及限田制度等原則規定，但可惜迄今尙未實行。</p>
<p>吾國號稱地大人衆，其實，地雖大而可耕之地不多，人衆却是實在。以衆多之人口，擁擠於狹小有限之耕地，生產不足供消費，再加上戰亂頻仍，與分配制度不良，所以時屆抗戰前夕，土地問題實已相當嚴重，尤其在東南部一帶，租佃情形特別不良之區，富者田迎千頃，貧者無地立椎。過去政府對此未有澈底辦法，社會裂痕顯著，不滿現狀的人太多，隨時可釀事變。其所以未爆發者，蓋一般佃農雇農，雖有相同之痛苦，却無明顯之階級意識，更少廣大之組織。八年抗戰，經徵兵或介入游擊隊工作，彼此接觸機會日多，久經部隊生活之訓練，知識程度，與前逈異，復員以後，欲使此種來自農邨之士兵，再安然走回家鄕，恢復原始的佃農　農生活，殆屬難能。而且在戰前，國內因有帝國主義及其附帶之封建勢力橫行，政府有內政外交種種關礙，有時實不能放手做事。經過此八年抗戰大破壞，全國三分之二淪爲戰區（包括東北），地主逃亡，人民流離，圖册散失，地籍凌亂，原有分配制度，完全破壞無遺。政府正應乘此時會，在舊秩序崩潰，新秩序建立以前，實施溫和的社會革命，澈底施行民生主義的土地政策。</p>
<p>蔣主席曾經昭示：「抗戰勝利之日，便爲推行民生主義的土地政策之良好時機」。國民黨六全大會所決議的政綱政策，關於民生主義的第六條，便是「農地除公營者外，應以最迅速有效之方法，實行耕者有其田，凡非自耕之土地，概由國家發行土地債券，逐步徵購並分配之。」此外並通過「戰士授田案。」這都是常局決心實施土地新政的表示。今後應如何把握此千鈞一髮稍縱即逝的良機，確定切實可行的方案，付之實施，以達國家於長治久安之境？（明日續完）</p>

<p>（本報訊）上海市臨時參議會，昨晨九時一刻，舉行第一次大會，首山秘書長項昌權報吿：（一）到會議員三十人，已逾法定人數。（地）奉行政院電，候補議員得列席旁聽，但不支軍馬費。（三）提案收到者已有十件，（四）參議員沈春暉等五人，臨時動議，趙參議員志淸逝世，提議（1）全體起立靜默一分鐘，以誌哀思，（2）派員慰問家屬，（3）致電行政院請從優撥給治喪費及致賻，由秘書處代辦，經全體通過。</p>
<p>繼由錢市長列席報吿施政方針，並先提供意見，希望各議員在意時間問題，開會十四天，日程雖可伸縮，但提案極多，審査討論費時甚久，又民政處係幕僚機構，非對獨成立，可歸其本人報吿，會計處與財政有關，則包括於財政報吿內，市長報吿，共分二部分：</p>
<p>一般行政概況</p>
<p>治安問題　本市收復之初，四郊盜匪充斥，但駐軍多係流動性質，市府一面增强警察力量，一面恢復保衛團之組織。當初僅有長警六千餘名，不敷支醞，故即甄別調整，並特設置警察訓練所，訓練基本幹部，用考試方式選拔幹部。因此在質量方面，均獲得不少進行。保衛團過去爲國效勞，功績卓著，確有重建之必要，因之於去年十一月成立保衛委員會，下設保衛總團部，又分特務及常備大隊，常備大隊團員俱係招募而來，按本市轄區，劃分八區團，共有團員一千三百零九人。義務團員共有一萬三千六百四十九人，保衛團團員服裝費用籌募不足，請求市府增收房捐以補充經費，同時將保衛委員會併入保衛團總部。至本市盜案處理，目前較戰前租界時期，允爲進步，據統計：民廿八年至三十年內，公共租界內盜案每年一月份平均發生一百四十九件，二月份爲一百二十三件，十一月份一百五十件，十二月份一百四十五件。自市府接收後，先後發生盜案，十一月份一百四十二件，十二月一百三十二件，本年一月一百零六件，二月份九十六件，三月上半月爲三十二件。破案者有一百四十七件，捕獲盜匪共四百二十七人。</p>
<p>工潮問題　工人生活問題，對於社會秩序，影響極大。本市收復以來，不斷發生工潮，市府對此事之處理，極爲重視。因此決定提高工資標準。但尙有一部分工人在怠工。罷工期間，往往有種種越軌行動，如毆打廠方負責人及職員等，甚至包圍社會局。此種行爲，如不制裁，不獨無法保障社會安寗，且影響生產事業。最近決定四項原則，以處理勞資糾紛：（一）國營事業遵照中央規定，不得有怠工罷工行爲。（二）罷工意工如果未經合法程序，應予取締。（三）要求條件如非今日中國生產狀况所能接受者，應予拒絕。（四）非法越軌行動，應予制裁。</p>
<p>淸除垃圾　市府接收之初，市區各街道垃圾，達一萬餘噸，經主管當局督飭淸除，半年來共計淸除垃圾卅八萬二千六百六十一噸。</p>
<p>疏通溝渠　本市經敵僞八年破壞，道路損毁，溝管淤塞，尤以滬西一帶，地勢低窪，每達雨季，積水無法宣洩，現已積極着手疏通河浜溝渠。</p>
<p>公用事業　本市接收之前，即奉中央命令，公用事業絕對不可使之停頓，故對水電儘量供應。本市路燈，戰前原有二萬三干餘盞，戰時存八千餘盞。現舊市區共有七百九十一盞，全市共有九千一百二十五盞。交通方面，戰前原有電車爲無軌電車共二十八綫，接收前行駛十二綫，現已恢復七綫。公共汽車現已開駛三錢，市輪渡已恢復長渡兩錢及對江渡兩綫。</p>
<p>地政設施　戰前本市雖有地政機構，但對地籍整埋，未及完成，淪陷期內，地籍更較紊亂，恢復後市府一面整理地籍，一面則淸理地捐。</p>
<p>掃除文盲　在敵偽期間，全係奴化敎育，現正竭力恢復，原有市立學校，在淪陷期內改爲私立者，仍得恢復爲市立，並加擴充公私學校。但全市文盲仍佔百分之五十以上，現正舉辦民衆補習學校。</p>
<p>財政困難　木市施政，不滿之處尙多，究其原因，第一爲財政困難。現本市稅收，僅爲娛樂·筵席·屠宰·牌照及房捐。　至此主席宣布大會休息十分鐘後，復由市長繼續報吿：</p>
<p>民政實施情形</p>
<p>設區公所　全市設置區公所，劃分爲三十一區，近因舊眞如區人民要求恢復該區，故增爲三十二區。除馬橋·塘灣兩區，暫不設立公所外，其餘三十區，已先後成立。經費方面，開辦費每區五十萬元，由市府一次發給，經常費每月甲種區一百十五萬九千七百五十元，乙種區八十五萬三于一百八十元，由市府按時發給。</p>
<p>編組保甲　決定保甲組織，採取三十進，每甲不得少於十戶，每保不得少於十甲，整編保甲，已於二月底完畢，統計本市共有一千零二十五保，二萬三千八百五十甲，保辦公處經費，每月八萬一千六百十五一元。</p>
<p>淸査戶口　淸査戶口已於三月十七日完竣，全市計六十九萬零九百五十入戶，三百三十四萬五千八百七十五人。關於頒發國民身份證，辦理公職候選人檢覈，籌備建立區民代表會，及籌辦本市參議員選舉等事項，均由該處加緊進行中。</p>
<p>潘序倫等提議　須先消弭工潮</p>
<p>報吿完畢，即由潘議員序倫提出問題，對市長決定處理工潮四原則，頗爲贊同。但本市物價如此高漲，與發生工潮有相當關係，工廠方面，都不願復工，此點視敵產處理局投標減少，即可證明，致使工人失業問題態趨嚴重。而內地工廠，現已取上海之地位而代之。現今外匯規定，美貨大量進口，影響上海工業發展至爲重大，非先解決工潮不可。王參議員冰又繼起表示工廠應注意維持秩序，提議發表宣言，引起社會注意。詹參議員文　認爲生產標準應有計劃，而生產生活指數，應請市府設法査核是否配合標準。王參議員艮仲則發表談話，市府當局及同人不應僅在資方立塲講話，當公平合理處置，以合三民主義原則。</p>
<p>徐永祚氏質詢解除民困二點</p>
<p>此時徐參議員永祚起立聲稱：本會規定程序爲市長報吿，乃請各參議員如有討論及建議事項，留待下次會議提出。繼徐參議員詢問二點：（一）報載市府擬在林森路建參議會所，深覺現今人民痛苦萬分，不應作此糜費，請將此項經費，移作解決民困之用。（二）市工務局擬拆除浙江路房屋以拓寬馬路，但目前房荒迫急，市民流離失所，希望能暫緩一二年拆除。</p>
<p>市長即起立答覆，建設會議塲所，僅有此建議而尙未確定，且經費亦未籌措。至拆除浙江路房屋，以後由市工務當局答覆。十一時半各議員在大樓前院攝影散會。</p>
<p>下午五時，錢市長在市府大禮堂舉行茶會，招待各參議員。計到參議員，軍政首長，各局局長，各報總主筆，記者等的百餘人，會中空氣融洽，熟鬧異常，至七時始散。</p>
<p>各參議員商討各項提案內容</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市臨時參議會參議員周學湘·水祥雪·范才　。沈鼎及趙班斧等五人，對於勞工問題，甚爲關懷。近接各勞工會建議，擬代表向參議會提案，昨日下午九時，特集合商討提案內容及詳細理由。主要項目計：（一）要求政府增加國民大會工會代表。（二）積極辦理工人福利，內包括工人子弟教育，設立工人托兒所等。（三）合理處置勞資糾紛。（四）恢復失業工人生活問題。（五）規定工人最低工資。（六）請求將工資生活指數按每月二次計算等。</p>
<p>奚玉書·王冰等參議員擬就提案有（一）敵僞產業處理局各碼頭倉庫，前經經濟部委託江海關査封管理，現要求政府令江海關將此項碼頭倉庫，移交市府接管。（二）主張證劵交易所即予復業，分別征收交易所稅。</p>
<p>周斐成參議員等除要求政府撥百分之三十之經費擴展本市敎育及補助私立學校外，尙要求政府令各軍事機關等所佔有之學校校舍予以歸還。</p>
<p>市參議員招待各區保長領袖</p>
<p>參議員王艮仲·沈春暉·呂恩潭·曹使·周斐成等五氏，定於今日下午二時，在趙主敎路二八五號王參議員寓邸舉行茶會，招待泰山。常熟。畫家灣。徐家匯四區區長曁各該區全體保長，聽取陳訴，俾轉達臨參會，以供參考，並聞其餘各參議員，亦將分組繼續舉行。閘北七萬市民向市臨參會提出救濟復興閘北之意見十二條。</p>

<p>又本市可的牛奶廠。上海牛奶廠。新牲牛奶廠職工。亦皆派代表參加旁聽。生生收塲職工，更印發書面呼籲，要大家來懲奸。沈案曾於二月十九日及本月廿三日公開審訊，在廿三日審訊時，生生牧塲職工張道德。黃家金等，曾呈出沈在上海淪陷期間與敵在經營上合作政以牛奶資敵之證據多種，故昨日開庭，提沈出庭。審判長劉毓桂即訊沈對生生收塲職工所提之證據，有何話說。沈萬靈除否認該塲職工等所提其曾與日人合作經營外，並辯稱：該塲曾於抗戰之初，捐贈國軍牛奶，以及其本人曾參加三民主義靑年團之愛國事實。更堅決咬定，生生牧塲職工對彼之檢舉，顯然有人覬覦其牧塲，因而收買並發動該塲職工吿發，冠以漢奸罪名，以遂其私慾。沈原聘有律師三人，昨日由王善祥律師出庭代其辯護，王稱：沈純係商人，在敵偽盤據期間，與敵人來往，乃係應付環境，純出於營利立塲云云。最後庭諭辯論終結，定下月五日宣判。</p>

<h3 id="c48">聨總中國分署督導小燕子海璧談　對我救濟物資分配情形　以恢復交通工鑛漁農等設備為前提原定數額計値閏金二萬五千六百萬 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「聯總」中國分署總會計處督導范海璧氏，此次乘「羣星號」客機抵滬，記者昨特趨訪，叩以「聯總」對我救濟物資分配情形，承吿：「聯總」善後救濟之對策，供應災區糧食，固屬重要，惟根本解決，尙在努力恢復各受災國之交通工礦漁農等各種設備，以便各能自力更生，而「聯總」之救濟工作，亦能有建設性之收穫。</p>
<p>職是之故，糧食救濟，乃佔次要地位。又「聯總」分配於我之救濟物資數量，各地報導，或不免稍有出入，據共方自「聯總」携來之數字觀之，去年一年中，「聯總」對我國救濟物資之分配，照原定數額，計値美金二萬五千六百萬元。此中計（一）交通電信設備一萬二千萬元，（二）公用事業設備二千萬元，（三）建築工業設備五百七十萬元，（四）礦物煤料八百萬元，（五）機械修理設備七百二十萬元，（六）燃料及機器油九百萬元，（七）雜項消費品（包括米糧等）二千二百萬元，（八）化工物料等六千四百萬元；而實際分配量，（一）項佔百分之一二二地，（五）項佔百分之二三〇，（六）項佔百分一五四，均較原定分配額溢出甚多。不足者亦有兩項，即（二）項佔百分之七九，（四）項佔百分之六七，其他（三七八）各項之分配百分比，尙未計出。</p>
<p>木年上半年度原定配給糾，計値美金一萬三千六百七十萬元。此中計（一）項九千五百三十萬元，（二）項九百五十萬元，（五）項一千一百四十萬元，（四）項一百五十萬元，（五）項一百萬元，（六）項六百萬元，（七）項五百萬元，（八）項一千一百萬元，此外新添改進工業設施一項，計五十萬元。本年上半年救濟物資之總重，爲六十九萬二千噸。又據吿去年一年中「聯總」對全世界（中國除外）救濟物資之實際分配量，照原定額之百分比甚低，例如交通電信設備僅佔百分之三三，工業善後設備僅佔百分之三五，農業善後設備僅佔百分之二二，糧食僅佔百分之一一。</p>
<p>汎美公司航行計劃</p>
<p>茫氏旋對汎美航空公司此後航行計劃，亦有所述。渠稱在美時曾據該公司職員吿謂：將計劃在美國與遠東間，關一太平洋中央航空綫。一俟獲得適量之「羣星」客機後，即可開設正常航程。按該公司於太平洋戰前，曾以飛箭式客機，航行遠東。惟該項客機，速率殊低，已不適用。該公司將共關航綫三條，除原有經由馬尼刺之一綫外，中央綫將起自舊金山，經檀香山，威克島，東京而達上海。北綫距離最短，將經過阿拉斯加及阿留申羣島等地。該項「羣星」客機，速率每小時爲三百哩，重五萬二千磅，最大載客量爲五十四人。范氏曾旅華多年，戰前爲「中國雜誌」之編輯人，一九三八至一九四二年間曾任職穴傳部國際宣傳處，且善操流利華語。</p>

<p>電力公司設法增加產量</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自電量取消分級制以後，木市用電數量激增。美商上海電力公司現正努力設法增加產量。據該公司負責人稱：最近即將增至最高量十二萬三千基路華特。蓋本市電力除一小部份由法商水電公司供應外，大部均係上海電力公司所供給。其消耗電　爲十一萬八千基路華特。</p>
<p>電力公司不勝負擔</p>
<p>日前市公用局曾召集美商·法商·華商·閘北·浦東·等各電氣公司，商討本市供電之分配，以減輕上海電力公司之發電負擔。因該公司遭戰時損失甚鉅，一年以內，尙不能完全恢復。目下之發電量僅及全盛時期之三分之一。戰前閘北水電公司可發電三萬八千基路華特，華商電氣公司有一萬六千基路華特，浦東電氣公司亦有五百基路華特，但皆已毁於戰火中。故上海電力公司之發電負担更爲重矣。</p>

<h3 id="c91">從山岳地帶出發　西蘭路雪中行腳 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十九日西安航訊　特約記者冰子</p>
<p>西北交通命　的西蘭公路，在八年餘的長期抗戰中，它劉　家，對人民，都已有了很大的貢獻，今後的開發西北和建設西北，在鐵路未完成之前，自然也唯此是賴。記者頃因事州重作西蘭路之行，沿途見聞，均錄之日記，雖多屬瑣事，却也有些値得報告的地方。</p>
<p>搭上轎車　駛離蘭州</p>
<p>由蘭州到西安，因寶天鐵路的通車，許多旅客雖取道天水，而沿西蘭路逕行來往者，仍然不少。重寳天路的火車，在旅費上較節雀，在時問上則不如乘汽車直截暢快。記者九日淸晨七時，於雪花紛飛中，劉開蘭州，搭乘的是一輛轎車，這是本週內山蘭開陜的第二輛車。買不到轎車客票的，皆乘下車。與記者同車者，多係還鄕人和複員人，有赴京滬者，亦有赴平津者。勝利以來，西北各省的復員人和還鄕人，大量的出走，尤以甘新兩省爲甚。向來感覺「人荒」和「材荒」的西北，如今對於出走的人，毫無限制，負賣當局似應予以深切的注意。</p>
<p>抵甘草店　積雪未溶</p>
<p>車抵甘車店，已十時許，用過早餐後，繼續前行，天氣仍是陰沉沉的。公路兩旁，已有不少的　人在田間勞作，前幾天的一塲大雪，大有裨助於農人的下種（春麥）。甘省去歲苦旱，今年大槪可望豐收。車過定西，即逐漸爬上高峯，沿途所至，積雪未溶，大地皆白，晚五時許，始抵旅客視爲長途的華家嶺。全日共行一八九公里。</p>
<p>華家嶺海拔二千七百公尺，旅客所畏懼是忍耐不了這兒的寒冷。過去華家嶺附近時常鬧土匪，現在有了駐軍，已相當平靖，這一帶高山峻嶺，人烟絕稀，當時修路工程的艱鉅，實非乘電者所能想像。爲了紀念殉難的工程師和民工的偉蹟，車站外建有石碑一座。</p>
<p>出嘉峪關　淚痕不乾</p>
<p>建設西北的先決條件，是發展交通。祗邊公路是不够的，鐵路的建設是刻不容緩的。我們希望各方以當年修築公路的決心和精神，提前來修築鐵路。記得吳稚暉光生前年漫遊河西後，曾對記者說：昔人謂「出了嘉峪關，兩眼淚不　」，這完全是因爲交通不發達的關係，嘉峪關外有的是肥美土地，假如鐵路一通，關裏的人，自然會跑到關外，即使是江浙人，也願意到關外開墾。吳老先生認爲鐵路不通，一切都是枉費的。</p>
<p>六月飛雪　並非神話</p>
<p>在華家嶺住的是中國旅行的招待所。十日晨六時六起床後，昨夜洗臉的毛巾，已凍成了冰塊。房間裏的火爐，好像是毫無用處。較之去年此時，記者由重慶經過此地時，冷度不知增加多少。天空飛着鵝毛似的大雪，司機本　「下雪好走，消雪難行」的德　，仍把車子開出。古人謂；「六月雪一是奇景，在這裏六月下雪，卻是很平常的　，江南人也計認爲這是神話。</p>
<p>冐雪前進　　無人煙</p>
<p>子於寒風凜冽中　雪前直，雖然是下坡路，也不敢急行。途中荒涼無人烟，偶過一二小村莊，看見的都是衣服破爛的老百姓。甘肅不產棉，全省將近七百萬人口的衣着，大都仰賴於外雀。省府曾提倡民間手工業，以羊　代棉，　補衣着的不足，但收效甚微。</p>
<p>下午一　，抵靜寗縣。此地以西北特有的「鍋盔」馳名，作「竊盔」的麵　不唯細白，且水質亦佳，習於　食者，講其味甚美。「鍋盔」」每斤八十元，較之蘭州市價便宜將近兩倍。一般旅客過此，多購此特產，以贈送覲友。</p>
<p>六盤山嵐　越高越濃</p>
<p>雪停了以後，原來預定在靜寗住宿的計劃打消。車出靜寗，一片平原　路旁邊的左公柳，屹然轟立。甘省　　年造林保林的施政方針，已獲相當效果。行二十餘公里後，又爬上較華家嶺允爲險要的六盤山。銀色世界，重現眼前，而濾義遮途愈高愈甚，有如重慶市的淸晨。六盤山傳爲無太祖成吉思汗駐節之地，究竟如何，記者尚未及考證。</p>
<p>下到山底，已見麥田發芽，楊柳初綠，氣候儼然不同了。薄暮時，抵三關口。山角有六郎潮，爲楊六郎當年率兵把守的要地。三關口附近的居民，至今還傳說着楊六郎英勇的故事，迨抵平但縣，已是萬家燈火了。</p>
<p>平涼爲隴東唯一的重鎭，人口的十萬，甘陝寗三省的商買，多薈萃於此，商業方面，頗稱發達。隴東接近陝北，過去因爲有「邊區」的關係，平凉便時常告警，現在全面軍事衝突已停止，今後的平凉大概可以平女了吧？</p>
<p>西蘭路共長七百一十九公里，全程預定四日到達，而以平凉爲中心點。平蘭段的四百一十五公里，多係山岳地帶，常予旅客以「行路難」的感覺。平西段的三百零四公里，路較平坦，兩日行程，頗覺鑒快。</p>
<p>抵涇川縣　遍地皆綠</p>
<p>十一日晨，離平凉，行六十五公里，抵涇川打尖。涇川爲甘省最東邊的一縣，亦是富庶之區二春朝到了涇川，田禾藏盛，逼地皆綠，大有江南風味。出涇川不遠，即入陝西省境，再前行，經過長武垣，午後即抵邠縣。</p>
<p>在邠縣留一宿，深感民情的純樸，因爲雨水得時，糧價也特別便宜。十二日晨，由邠縣出發，經永薄，乾縣，醴泉，咸陽等縣，而至西安。乾縣附近，有武則天墓，咸陽乃是秦始皇的安樂窩，漢唐時代的遺蹟，亦有很多。陝省有古蹟名勝，實在是够人欣賞的，可惜記者一時還沒有機會前往觀光。（三月十九日）</p>

<p>香港老百姓似乎都有這樣的感覺，軍政的存在是恢復舊觀的障碍物。到了今天，爲什麽還不撤銷軍政呢？無論如何，軍政是一種非常時期的措施，牠不鱗求成規，而善於權變。最大的，政府爲了一時之計，牠可以不顧老百姓的利益和需要，拿出「軍政」兩個大字來塞悠悠之口。誠然，軍政因爲能够集中權力，即決即行，在百度待興之中，祇要是爲民謀利者，自然也有很多可取地方。但人們的心目中，對這兩個大字多少會聯想到不愉快的事情，在安居樂業之中，委實不想再來看見或聽聞牠們的了。</p>
<p>香港當局洞識老百姓的心理，業經加緊進行恢複民政。若干殖民地行政專家們，最近已從倫教來港，他們「爲便利將來工作起見，多於公餘之暇，聘請華人教師，學習廣東語言，故其公文袋中，除應辦的文件外，常夾有一本廣東語讀本」本月初，港報盛傳將於四月一日恢復民政。港府各機關已限令舊日職員報到復職。民政總督的人選，亦在推測中</p>
<p>兩種不同表示</p>
<p>軍政政民治長官麥道高，特率夏　中將之命，於本月二日返英與殖民地都商討香港問題。再過一週，香港陸軍總司令菲士廷少將，便對記者表示：在三個月內，香港可望恢復民政，從菲士廷將軍這句機威的話，香港恢復民政之期，縱不如所傳的四月一日，最遲也不會過六月一日了。</p>
<p>商人們對於恢復民政，表示特別歡迎，據他們說：（一）可以追索港府或私人戰前的欠賬，（二）可以提取被凍結的銀行存款，（三）可以比較容易購買外匯，（四）可以自由買賣物品和股票……也有表示　　的，他們認為民政恢復後，（一）政府將不再維持出售公價米，（二）有錢的人如虎添翼，可以爲所　為，（三）業主們可以任意加租或　走房客，（四）物價將益趨高漲……。不管歡迎也好，擔憂也好，大家還是希望民政平日恢復，而民政之恢復，也已在人們的希望中漸次實現。</p>
<p>平價米沒有了</p>
<p>民以金爲天，除了民政以外，另一個萬衆關懷的問題便是食米的供應。開門七件事，米是其中主要的一件。然而過去幾個月，一元五斤的公價米，却把內地的人民火批的吸進香港來。香港常局眼看米的消耗日增，而米的來源日短，第一步便把每人每天一斤食米的分配量，减爲十二兩。結果無濟於事。第二步便半數配白米，半數配麺粉—香港食米配給。五天一次，每天十二兩，每次共配四斤，半數則得兩斤。據說麺粉比貧米　　充足，因此每次減爲兩磅。每磅麵粉的價値和每斤食米的價値相同，分配量雖屢經改變，但直至目前爲止，兩毛錢一斤的價値，始終如一。到了本月八日，第三步便索性停化發給新購米證了。</p>
<p>香港當局宣佈停發新購米證的理由：是香港食米來源，槪以　盛頓聯合糧食局的分配額，爲依據而糧食局的分配額，則根據香港人口多寡每三個月釐定一次。近因內地人民大量移入，米繼求過於供，而華盛頓糧食局不能隨時考慮增加香港食米的分配額，故香港必須停發新購米證，並向中國內地人民警告：「香港再無平價米」！</p>
<p>勉強塡塞肚皮</p>
<p>據我國出席聯合國善後救濟總署首席代表蔣廷　博士最近宣稱：香港今年首季的食米分配額，計違三萬四千噸。這個數目，若以每人每日配給十二兩計，則可供應八十萬人以上，快無匱乏之　，（香港目前入口的僅七十萬。）但據港府發言說：香港實際收到的食米供應量，不及原額半數。香港居民便該以每天一頓飯一頓麵過活。這個食譜，在上海同胞看來，也許不會吃不上口，但廣柬人是不慣吃麵的。現在也祇好勉强塡塞肚皮！否期便要吃每斤一元至一元四角的黑市米，折合國幣約據六百元一斤，請問：一般薪水階級或貧民如何吃得起？</p>
<p>食的問題，沒有妥善的解決，則其他社會問題接踵而來，枝節橫生。今日的香港，盜風尚未稍戢，而工潮却像決了堤的洪水似的到處汎濫……人們失望之餘，有意無意地把希望寄托於民政之上，滿以爲將來民政恢復了，商塲便可望繁榮，社會問題也得以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>目前香港的人們，芷在大做其民政恢復的美夢。（三月廿二日）</p>
<h3 id="c93">武漢怯春寒 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 廿四日漢口航訊　本報特派員　周崖影寄</p>
<p>春天裏的冬天</p>
<p>交春以來，此間陰雨綿綿，寒流欲墜，却又覺不到一點溫暖的氣氛。而且，在這些寗雨的日子裏，還一度雜着去冬不曾降過的冰雹，達到去冬未曾有過的冷度；這一來，使闊氣的太太小姐們的春裝，延遲了招展街頭的時日，倒也無關宏旨，只可憐那些無衣的平民以及來自後方的難胞，滿以爲冬天之後，緊接的就是陽春，誰知陽春還不能掙脫「冬」的鎖鍊。於是，三鎭的街簷下，平添了一福新的流民圖。飢餓，疾病，死亡，不僅滋擾着窮苦的人們，也多少驚起了闊人的焦慮與自危。</p>
<p>早些時，好像春天也悄悄地光臨過一次。市郊的枯柳，都稀疏地抽出了新芽。尤其是中山公園，整日地吐納着成千成萬的「遊春」者，誰會料到氣候的演變，竟會這樣冷暖失常？柳絲抽出後，又被摧毀了，「雅士」們發出傷春的嗟嘆，農人們縐着眉頭，爲春收與春耕乏愁。大家對於這春行冬令的現象，都認爲是太不及時了。</p>
<p>但，武漢的另一方面，却似乎仍有春天存在。一部分衣錦榮歸的「國難財主」，和另「部分關然擢居功臣的「耆宿」與「新貴」，他們在紙醉金迷，鶯啼燕語的溫柔鄕裏過着他們幻覺的春天，忘記了現實的一切。但在他們的春天裏，又何嘗沒有嚴冬的隱憂呢？前日深夜警察局的巡官們，在一個舞國紅星的「別墅」裏，破獲了幾個達人宜賈與漢奸聚睹的奇案。十一個睹徒狎客，都一倂帶局法辦，總算是替他們的春情，蒙上一層冬景了！</p>
<p>這「東方芝加哥」的春寒，正象徵着人們沉鬰的心情。市面畸形的繁榮，粉飾不了內在不安的情緒。截至目前止，幾乎沒有人從廢墟中重建房屋，大家都採取一種觀望的態度，存着一種期待的念額，有時且意識到期待將為現實所摧毀，正如春天的景色剛一透露，就被義冬的餘威催毀一樣。這裏沒有旖旎明媚的春光，有之，也只能說是「春天裏的冬天」吧。</p>
<p>糧價物價賽跑</p>
<p>在春天裏的冬天裏，人們更畏懼着助長春寒威勢的糧價和物價。在湖北，本年度徵購軍糧的數額爲六十萬大包，俘糧二十萬大包。軍糧的徽購，每市斤作價五十元，而商塲的市價，早已達到三百元了。這種巨大的差額，只有出在老百姓身上，部隊向地方政府要糧，鄕保人員自然振振有詞，不無藉端勒索之事端發生。據漢陽人民的呼藉，全縣所派軍糧，實際已超過配額五倍有餘。本來，在目前情勢下徵購軍糧，也許是無可厚非的　，但這樣重重剝削，却影響民食太大了。</p>
<p>田賦豁免是中央一大德政，而下級政府並未深潔體認。田賦豁免以後，縣鄕機構以財源枯竭，父只好把自治經費的籌措，攤派在老百姓的身上。攤派的數額沒有一定的限度。就武昌縣而言，本月份每一住戶應繳的軍糧與自治費，計達一萬二千二百元，其他各地，當更可想而知了。</p>
<p>由於種種原因，武漢不僅鴻到了很多義民，同時也湧來很多避難的「莊稼人，」還鄕的義民不能歸家，有家的莊稼人也得相率逃亡。特別是大別山脈一帶，因軍事衝突的結果，千餘里方圓的農村，已荒蕪了十分之七，農舍幾乎蕩然無存，怎能不奔向都市投生？</p>
<p>軍糧孔急，都市人口激增，已足使此問糧價扶搖直上，而湘鄂連年天災人禍，收穫旣不豐，耕種面積又很狹，早已釀成普遍糧荒，再加交通困難，外來接濟不易。游資充斥，囤米國貨之風日熾，於是糧價物價，便相偕作漲價的賽跑了。前幾天，有位巴東縣長自殺於武昌，留下的遺言，有這樣幾句話：「我不忍剝削人民，我又無法養活家口，我只好選擇自殺的路！」的確，糧價物價在噬人，潔身自好的薪　階級，實已遭到比戰時更可怕的厄運。</p>
<p>「物價跳，大家噪，汽笛呌，大家笑！」在公共遊覽的塲所中，往往有販夫走卒唱出這樣的歌謠．大家似乎理解到物僅問題的解決，是要生產加多，是要交通暢達，所以希望輪船的汽笛呌，火車的汽笛呌，工廠的汽笛一齊呌。可是，鐵路綫始終沒有暢通，長江水位仍是西當枯落，其他工業複員，也都陷於停滯，要想從生產與交通來平抑物價，還是可望而不可即哩！</p>
<p>據王主席自渝歸來談：中央已決定各省軍糧購價，以各該省內若干市塲的市價平均計算，一次核定，不再變更，這是一個相當合理的決策。如果地方政府能妥實遵行，則”前鬱悶的低氣壓，將獲得一個澄淸的機會。</p>

<h3 id="c94">貪官奸商像一陣陰風　吹冷了市民 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>「武漢有不同的兩種人，創造出相同的一個世界，他們只要別人的痛苦越加深，自已越可獲得過多的幸福。」一個　學夫子顧實老教授在經過這裏時，也發出了這樣的論調，不管他是牢騷抑是感慨，倒也値得發人深省。原來近些日子，貪汚像一陣風，奸商也像一陣風，這兩陣風吹向一個世界，讓大多數的人戰慄在他們的淫威下。</p>
<p>據行政院特派員莫衡談稱：接收敵僞物資，計有二千餘種，價値在兩百萬萬元以上，政府早就計劃完全出售，以抑低此間物價。但是接收的機關疊床架屋，沒有明晰的權限，不該接收的既已接收，奉命接收的又得迫其交出，甚至倉庫　璧發現幾個大洞，大半物資不翼而飛，交的要求馬虎了事，接的不肯在淸單蓋印。諸如此類的接收風波，正以不同的姿態在扮演，誰也沒有關心政府的收入應該馬上繳到國庫，人民期待的大批物資　要立即搬進市塲。</p>
<p>就透用這種機會在收復區發了勝利財的，現在大有其人，他們既腰繼百萬，便在這裹以化名方式組織各種企業公司，以謀個人經濟的發展。於是，官僚勾結巨商，商人攀附達官，造成一條「聯合陣議」。每個較大的公司，董事長多是權要，經理定係商人，經理在業務上大顯身手，出了事，董事長自會抱腰，這兩種人相互爲用，把自己的幸福，建築在別人的痛苦上，而窮苦的平民，便壓得吐不過氣來。</p>
<p>當記者初到武漢的時候，一石熟米的賣價不過四千元，現在已衝破四萬大關了。一包火柴只要十元，現在已買到五十元了。一斤蘇油，只要百八十元，現在買到八百餘允了。這原因，在以前也許還可以用經濟學的眼光，拿「供求律」去解釋，到現在，則問題幷不那樣合乎科學原理。只要你有辦法借到本錢，隨便兜幾個繼子準可利市百倍。囤也好，賣也好，反正管制物資的戰時法令都已廢止，儘可隨你去操縱。正因如此，這裏的高利貨，雖有月息達大四分者，但游炎充裕的財神，幷不愁沒有放處。</p>
<p>嚴　岔汚，澎滿吏治的工作，這裏好像也在進行。但除了五峰，當陽，應山，三縣縣表，都以貪汚凟職正被省府解送法院査辦外，他如交通部科長熊飛，以初用　務，營私舞弊還五千餘萬元一案，僅業處徒刑十二年。省府科長葉錢雄　賣公　達數萬萬元，仍只一走了事。當各參議會向省當局追究葉案時，得到的答覆是：「葉同志是國家培植的骨年，諸位先進繼給他一條自新之路！」這探的貪汚案，如此輕鬆地放縱他，眞使人莫明其妙！</p>
<p>「兩種人創造了一　相同的世界。」只有窮苦的小民，過着南極的冬，北極的慶，不易受到溫暖了。</p>
<p>創痕彌補了嗎</p>
<p>從外形來觀察，國土重光後，嶄新的國　，不時在光芒奪目，迎風招展，發出一些和平溫煦的情調，幾條熱鬧的市街，也好像彌縫了傷痕，漸漸變得繁榮起來，但這只是新生的信號，而不能算是新生的實質。</p>
<p>先看市空，這裏曾遝用日俘淸掃溝渠，消除了不少的汚穢，上月中旬，爲了準備某公巡視，并曾舉行一次淸潔大檢査，動員了六萬二千四百人，以三天的工夫，掃除子增圾一千九百三十八噸，道不能不算是市府各局的一大勞績。可惜時過　遷，故態複萌，危牆沒有堆砌，淸道夫很少配備，陰溝　物和街衢垃圾，依然臭氣冲天，高　如丘。至於　修馬路與興辦公益事業等，則以市府收入短絀，連員役薪餉尙欠三百三十四萬萬餘元，更是無能爲力，只好任其殘缺了。</p>
<p>「春　可慮！」依據善孜總署發表的「預計」，戰後武漢，可能有瘟疫百餘種。每種的患者，可能有數十萬人，雖然這可怕的預計，尙未成爲事實，而據市衛生局的報吿，天花，白　，腦　炎　已蔓延於貧民　居的區城。針對這一事實，正宜作有效的邊止。可是武漢的衛生設備，還不够起碼的條件，除了原有的幾個私立醫院及後動部與行政院的衛生隊外，僅有省立及市立醫院各一，病牀總共不過三百四十張，所以防疫的呼聲，儘管如春啻一樣的疲耳，而有蘭方面僅僅製了幾張防疫的傳單，此外，如注射預防針，設立檢査站與開設隔離病院等，都還一籌莫展。</p>
<p>擺在目前的另十問題，是失業救濟和工業復員，據省市當局比較精確的統計，武漢的失業人數，的十一萬五千餘人，內三分之一是技術工人。社會部曾撥款二千萬元交工人福利社辦理救濟，以半數作為小本貸款，以半數購買三輪車，租予工人行駛武昌。但杯水車薪，恐難有濟。另一方面，敵僞殘存的工碳事菜，原共三百餘單位，現在僅有交湖北省府保管的八十四單位中，已有廿九單位已整頓復工，合併成爲機械·酒精·煉油·磚瓦·釀造·紡織·火柴及造紙等八儸廠。總計八廠工人，不過一千五百餘人，實在可憐得很。雖然另有十藏家內遷工廠正組聯合會，準備在漢復工，但困難重重，更不知何日才能聽到機杼之聲，一方是人力荒廢，一方是工業停滯，怎不呌人極度沉　？</p>
<p>與失業問題同樣嚴重的，是兒　與靑年的失學。目前教育部已籌撥的款，在此舉辦臨時大學先修班及補習班各十所，省府方面已設武昌漢陽兩個臨時中學和五偶省會小學。漢市府也辦了男女中學各一所，回民小學十七所。再加上原有的私立學校，總算頗有可觀。但武漢的失學人數，已超過八萬人，現有學校的容量，離開需要太遠。何况房荒嚴重，校舍無着，教部籌辦的先修班與補習班，依然是開學無期。甚至連已有校舍的市立十四小學，因房主收回自用，還引起小學生的請願哭訴。在這情形下，獲得求學機會的籠兒，只是少數靠着隕人介紹的紈袴子弟，他們的芳踪倩影，時在舞塲出現，甚至別開生面，有在舞塲舉行校務會譏的奇談！此等不良校風，念待予以糾正。</p>
<p>記者最後要說：在武漢新生之中，確有貧血病與腐蝕菌的存在。我相信，帶着冬意的春景一定會成爲過去，那麼，下次通訊，當繞量報道些光明面的情形！三·廿四。）</p>

<h3 id="c96">今日蘇北「解放區」「民主」政治眞面目 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>「蘇北」和「江南」，只是一江之隔；今日之江南。已是一天天的安定了，繁榮了，尤其是身居在大城市的人們，耳目口鼻，給歌舞酒食黨蒸着，已漸漸地忘掉了八年簡火藥的氣息，可是在一江之隔的蘇北，一直到勝利已近一年的今日，還有十分之九的是在過　　堅輾轉欲哭無淚的生活。而這一種求生不得求死不能的生活，還不知要煎　到何日爲止！</p>
<p>筆者是在舊曆新年裏，借了出門拜年的名義，經過了千方百計，遭受了難以言傳的艱苦，一直到最近，才到達了江南這「天堂」之境的。回憶起家鄕的情况，恍忽有如隔世；而這髣髴是另一世界的蘇北的「解放區」現狀，也許有非局外人所能想像得到的。</p>
<p>「解放區」的當周，「政治指導員」是每一小地區的最高權力者；而「政治指導員」的一切措施，則完全根據於「黨」的命令。他們的武裝，—所謂「人民武裝」，就是絕對做他們一切行動的「工其」；他們在自己的正規軍隊以外，普遍地編組了「民兵隊」，以做他們軍事上的外國：任何軍事行動，都是呌民兵去打先鋒，正規武力，便用機關槍緊追着民兵的後面；如果民兵有臨陣退精的，後面也是一條「不光榮」的死路；因此每要完成他們的一次「任務」，民兵死傷幾千人，是算不了一件什麽的。如果被攻擎的方面。不忍心傷害了這些無辜的本民而退讓一些，就正中了他們的「苦肉計」；如果眞給他們還一下手，他們便又籍此多了一次宣傳的炎料。壯年的平民越「解放放」而死亡越多，農工百業日益荒棄，倖存的人民還要忙着時常發動些「慰勞」，「捐贈」，自糧食柴草，以至衣被鞋襪，以至歸女兒童，就無所不包繭。</p>
<p>同時「解放區」的當局，最忌刻的就是知識份子，和平時在地方上有此簣望的人；因爲這最是他們工作推展的一種「障碍」；障碍富然是必在剷除之列！爲着要實現「民主」的精神，先給進班人加上儸「頑固」，「圖特」，「托匪」的名目，接着就召集人民大會來「公審」，舉行人民大會時，全地區的男女老幼，一律必須參加的、誰不參加，誰就是「反抗命令」，這是吃不消的。開會之時，由指導員分組指導，先呌被公審的人自已登台去「坦白」；如果伸述的不如他們的意，就是「不坦白」，必須重說；如果竟是坦白的還不如式，那麽就有擠在指導員旁邊的「人民代表」出來駁斥了；一個屐斥以後，指導員立刻就付「表決」；指導員的話，又有誰敢在老虎嘴上摸鬍子！還樣一來，障碍份子就在人民公意之下剷除盡凈了；「民主」精神也就這樣的表現的無遺了。</p>
<p>現在各地區都有了「民選」的行政人員，建立起「人民」的行政機構；方式都是如出一轍。老百姓在這積年苦難之中，只馨香禱祝地希望沒有人找他的麻煩，給他就是樹皮草根能够吃得平安些，也就不作其他的奢望了；無奈就這一點點微小的無可再小的希望，也沒有給他們得到！他們那敢和軍政常局再尋出半點麻煩。當然任何命令和指示，也就只有惟命是從了。</p>
<p>在這地區內的人民，是沒有一宅較爲完整的住宅的，比較整齊一些的房屋，都給拆的乾乾淨淨；甚至連農家畜糧的狗，也給殺減的一隻不留；生而爲一隻狗，他富然吏不知道是犯了一種什麼罪的！在勝利以前這麽做，說是爲着避免日寇的活動；勝利以後，還有不少的房屋，甚至已被拆毀的頽垣，仍要繼續地拆，說是要把「資產階級」的殘餘，撲減乾淨了才好。有點土地的業主，在「農抗會」主持之下，發動一種叫「倒租」遝動，哄糧戶把以前已收去的租，要按照日息複利計算退出；退不出錢和　的，就把土地拿出來劃算；因爲糧戶是只有退租和繳納「公糧」的義務，收取出租根本就談不到了。他們也需要商人音他們吸收「解放區」以外的谷種需用的物資，但是所給付的代價，却是超過於法幣四五十倍的「抗幣；」至於法幣在那裏，却和過去的「中儲券」同樣的不通用，甚至於有甚於偽幣！運在「解放區」外印行的報紙雜誌，都在讓禁之列。筆渚一位親戚，偶然一個不留意，從泰州回去，給査出一張包套鞋的報紙，是四個月以前的申報，便弄出很大很大的麻煩！閱報閱書的自由都沒有了，言論的目由，更就談不到。許多地方的郵局都被「交通局」强制接收了，把原有的員工一齊驅出去，由他們另外委人來辦；郵票也換了他們的一種印上毛澤東相斤的。人民要和外面非「解放區」通値，固然是難到極點，就是在區內通信，也要受到嚴格的檢査；如有發現到人民與中央有關的人通了恒，便被視爲奸逆，立即有傾家喪命的危臉！勝利雖已近一年了，凡在政府或軍隊裏服務，或在後方從事抗建工作的人士，到今都還不容許回到自己的家園。他們淪陷在這地區的家屬，被名之曰「頑屬」拆屋固然先從「頑屬」的房屋拆起，「頑屬」的男女老幼，也就永久被嚴厲藍視着，連儉着嘆一口氣都不可能！至於勝利以後，中央派去任事的官員，給莫名其妙的方式而喪命的，也所在多有：淮陰縣的縣長和行政專員，就是不久以前的例子。然而曾經參加為組織，眞正和敵為合作的滇奸，卻又並不在注意之列；也許因為這班人會弄錢，很有些和他們很親熱地在做着生意咧。雖然這種生意，也許他們的上層未必完全知道。</p>
<p>住在「天堂」裏的人們，大多數對於這蘇北貧瘠之區是不大署重的，然而在中共方面却認爲是他們一個挺好的「糧倉」，連在這地區以外的食糧，也從這裏取給了不少。這一個太平原，事實上確確實實是一個「魚米之區」，就是江南各城市中所需的物品，例如棉花，豆，小麲，高糧，以及豬牛鵝鴨之類，也有六部分是由蘇北供給的；只因這裏的交通不便，不易招致外人去考察，外間因不甚明瞭其實情，就不免把他忽略了。而在這裏面別有用心的人，正好就利用這一個朝野都不大看重的機會，可以爲所欲爲，造成了如今的一個局面！當勝利的消息初傳到蘇北的時候，大家興奮得什麼似的，以爲從此可以出水火而登袵蓆了；那知一直到今，局面竟伕然是這樣的惡劣；袵蓆固不知在何處，而處境的痛苦，竟是如水益深，如火益然了！</p>
<p>筆者最近得着家鄕輾裨傳來的口信，我家也被目爲「頑屬」了；目前他們正在向我的「頑屬」要限期交出我這個人！我不敢再回去，也不願再回去送死國雖然明知流浪　到了江南，「天堂」裏也沒有我棲身之地，然而能在「天堂」裏做一個離莩，精神究竟還暢快得多咧。（淮生，二月二十四）日</p>

<p>火車中，旅館內，都是定量的米交換購食限額的飯。到親友家去吃一頓便飯，也須拿出相當的米糧作交換，已是成爲無庸客氣的常識了。我們外國人的居留，本來是如出所住縣境之外須報吿警察署請領許可證，後來，如出所住的市鎭之外，也要受此限制了。</p>

<p>— 陳淦閣</p>
<p>敎育是一種生活經騐，用文字來傳達給後來的人，無論如何，現在中國的敎育，是經過一番翻譯手續的。這樣的敎育人才，就如目前一樣，必須經長時期的訓練，方成一個普通的知識者，說不上技術，如何能夠得上發展敎育呢？因為這原因，曾有人提　華文拉丁化，用羅馬字來串連吾國的語言，這樣，似乎可以簡化吾國文字了，但事實上，吾國數千年來的方塊字，早就成為表演　國粹的唯一利器，怎能廢之於一朝一夕呢，然而，方塊字空間是文化進展上之一大贅瘤，在急轉直下的時代裏，宜乎關心敎育　人，時時為我們的贅瘤担心！</p>
<p>但，有人會問：誰呌你生於這個時代的中國呢？你旣不能目　各種各樣的事實發生，那麼你就得從方塊字裏一件一件去認識他！</p>
<p>不錯，　然每個人事實上不能親眼看見每一件事，必須經過了文字上的翻譯，才能增加了一些知識。毋怪乎一個用功的中學生必須牢捧着書本，演完了十題數字，再去翻歷史，讀地理，抬頭看一看鐘，已是子夜時分了，而身畔要讀（預備）的功課，還是那麼一堆，中學生，讀了十年的書，連研究都談不到，祇是讀，讀，讀了十年的書，時間把他束縛得很守法，所以連研究都談不上，由此，才可以推想出難道中國果眞沒有人才嗎？中國的敎育，其所以談不上技術的，和富有研究性的，決不是文字上的缺點，是可以斷言的了。</p>
<p>中國敎育旣不受文字的阻撓，而是受敎育時期拉得太長了。試想，從讀牛羊草花直到明白之乎也哉的解釋，也要化它那麼多的時間；——其實，眞正上國文課，祇是每週五小時，其餘的算術呀，史地呀，自然呀，美術呀，…………多得把剛敎了的牛土草花也忘了。這說：牛字難嗎？我說：New的才難呢！</p>
<p>譬如歷史，先生捧着書，呆呆地讀了魏蜀吳鼎立後，問道：「都懂得了嗎」？學生們一定在回家自修時熟讀數小時後，才能知道鼎立之勢；若把魏蜀吳搬上了銀幕，他們不但立即知道，並連那一個是，那一個非也喊得出了。</p>
<p>譬如地理，上升海岸，和下沉海岸，人情風俗，若移於銀幕上，學生們對地理，不再感到乏味了。</p>
<p>有人反問：說何容易，你不知道中國是窮嗎？沒有錢，學校裏就造不起電影院，你知道嗎？</p>
<p>我怎樣不知道呢？同時我也知道很多學校可以改裝或現有着塲子，但他們決不肯如此做，而製片商也不肯將上升和下沉海岸攝入鏡頭，因為給學生看，研究，是賣不上錢的。更何況娛樂捐　財政局的收入，而敎育經費是敎育局的支出呢？</p>
<p>但是我們不得不高喊：</p>
<p>「簡化教育！」</p>
<h3 id="c99">兒童劇運難處 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>看到唐紹華先生的需要建「兒童劇塲」，不禁深有感慨。</p>
<p>「兒童劇塲」的建設，是迫切需要的；但在建設之前，兒童團的提倡，兒童劇的展開，兒童劇的被同情與被重視，該是必需爭取和必需做到的吧！</p>
<p>我們的「囝囡劇社」，就在這樣的前提下，在民國二十九年春天成立，淪陷期間，用自己的社名或為了避免「登記」和敵偽的注意，也曾借了「上海滬劇社囝囡組」等名義，先後公演過八次。</p>
<p>勝利後，也在「俄　」，演過二次，</p>
<p>但結果怎樣呢？</p>
<p>社會的反響，並不怎麼大，而支出的精力，却異常巨大。</p>
<p>這是一種艱苦的，吃力不討好的工作。</p>
<p>現在，我想把經騐中得來的若干困難，希望如唐先生一樣，有「赤子之心」的戲劇工作者，來共同打開。</p>
<p>一，劇本荒　整個劇圈，雖然都在鬧；但兒童劇本，可說是「沙漠」，我們上演過的二個多幕劇和十多個獨幕劇，都是自己編寫的。</p>
<p>二，導演荒　職業導演，果然「兒童」負担不起；就是有一點研究，有點成績的導演，但也因忙，或其他原因，都無法請到。我們的導演，也都是我們自己或其他的業餘愛好者。</p>
<p>三，時間荒　兒童劇的演員，大多是各中小學生的學生，但現在的上海中小學校，上課時間是不一律的。想在四點鐘後排戲，有的學校上課到六點；禮拜天吧，有的學校也要上課的。所以只好晚上，但小學生九點後回家，總得護送，這在人事上，就加倍吃力。有時碰到各學校不一律的「小考」，湊了東家，湊不了西家，也往往阻礙排戲。</p>
<p>四，兒童容易感冒，這在大多數營養不良的上海兒童，實在是太平常的事情。我們經常地在排戲過程中，碰到某某傷風了，某某頭痛了，只好臨時中　。甚至有一次在「璇宮」上戲，某兒童臨時生病了，弄得手忙脚亂。</p>
<p>五，經濟吃勿消　二十九年夏天，我們在「寗波同鄉會」公演，座券只售三角和五角，倒夠開支。但勝利後，可不對勁了，去年十月在「俄國藝術劇院」演了三塲戲，就蝕了偽幣四百多萬。都是我們幾個敎員，尅扣了薪水墊出來的。後來排好了「愛的敎育」，預備元旦公演，一打聽劇塲，佈景，燈光之類的價目，平均漲了十五倍，這如何吃得消呢？只好把排好的戲，「吹」了。</p>
<p>六，社會上輕視兒童　這是我們中國的老傳統，以為小孩子總是不高明的；雖然看過我們戲的人，還說看得過，有的還說「不容易」。但票價要售得和普通業餘劇社一樣，就不免惹人「笑」了。票價要壓低，開銷是和其他劇團一樣的。有時甚至還碰到「他們演小囝戲，削他一個黃瓜兒」。這，又如何吃得消呢？</p>
<p>七，大多數敎員不明白戲劇敎育的重要　我們演出的對象，是然是以學生為第一位。但大多數的敎員，不給我們同情和帮助，他們以為做戲只是「玩玩兒」的，甚而有些學校裏的頑固派，還禁止兒童加入劇社。</p>
<p>上面這些，都是我們七年來，在兒童劇運的工作上，得到的實際困難。要把兒童從荒淫的娛樂中搶救出來，要提倡眞正的兒童戲劇敎育，上面這些困難，在建設「兒童劇塲」之前，我們必須打破，而且要立刻打破才是。</p>
<h3 id="c100">「中」字招牌的影劇團體 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 樂道</p>
<p>在後方的影劇團體，官辦的要佔大多數，因此名稱方面，大都以「中央」「中國」「中華」冠首，即屬民營者，亦以「中」字打頭，全部「中」字招牌。自從勝利後，這些「中」字頭影劇團體相繼東來，有的是依靠這「中」字招牌來接收的，有的是想藉此爭取地盤的。因為「中」字之多，圈外人難免有些不明眞相，現在全部臚列於後，看看「中」字招牌，究有多少。</p>
<p>「中電」：是中央電影攝影塲的簡稱，直屬於中央宣傳部，原設南京，抗戰後西遷重慶南岸，原在南京的攝影塲於戰爭中被毀，後被敵偽改建平房甚多。這次在上海被接收的「華影」各廠，分配給「中電」的；有閘北的文化新聞製片廠，由「華影」收買後的國華廠，海格路的「華影」製片部，和漢彌登大厦三樓的「華影」辦事室。</p>
<p>「中製」：是中國電影製片廠，直屬於軍事委員會政治部，其前身為漢口行營政訓處電影股，抗戰初期成立於武漢，武漢淪陷前夕亦遷重慶建廠。此次在滬接收到的為「藝華」廠和徐家匯三角地的「聯華」廠，其管理部門和發行部門也設在漢彌登大廈三樓。</p>
<p>「中敎」：是中華敎育電影製片廠，直屬於敎育部，專攝製十六糎無聲片，成立於三十一年秋間，廠址設在重慶北溫泉，因係初創，外界對他的印象也比較淺，在這次勝利接收聲中，沒有得到什麼，正由中宣部將「中電」在南京的舊址劃規「中敎」，也可說是「平均分配」了。</p>
<p>除了上述的電影製片機關外，戲劇團體方面，則有：</p>
<p>「中萬」：中國萬歲劇團的簡稱，是「中製」附辦的，班底也是「中製」的人員，近年來在重慶演出甚少，最近打算在上海重整旋旗鼓。</p>
<p>「中電劇團」：原是「中電」附辦的業餘組織，因為在後方不能拍片子，演演話劇也可撑撑門面，自渝遷滬後，一時物色不到演出塲址，頗傷腦筋，最近始在蘭心上演「萬世師表」，在組織方面將以自給自足的姿態出現，漸漸離「中電」而獨立起來。</p>
<p>「中術」：中國藝術劇社，趙志游金山等組織，勝利之前，因內部經濟崩潰而瓦解。</p>
<p>「中藝」：中華劇藝社，應雲衛主持，在重慶成都各地苦撑了好幾年，現仍在內地。</p>
<p>「中青」：三民主義青年團的中央青年劇社，也屬官辦之例，先後由馬彥張駿祥担任過社長，近一二年來因主持無人，似在停頓狀態中。</p>
<p>此外在重慶的劇社，還有「怒吼」「業餘」和好幾個「巧立名目」「曇花一現」的團體，因為不用「中」字招牌，也無需贅述了。</p>

<h3 id="c101">青史名標 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 瑯環</p>
<p>「青史名標」是米高梅影片公司攝製，西蒙導演，一張五彩的戰事影片，同時也是華雷斯皮萊紀念他本人從事影業三十年，更為致獻給美國海軍而拍攝。華雷斯皮萊的演技早已受一班觀眾的推許，但在這片中，我們更可以看得出來，他是盡全力以赴。這種紀念的方法，的確是很富有意味的，因為這努力給華雷斯及萊的光榮歷史，又增添了燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>華雷斯皮萊在這部影片中，飾一個服務三十年後，退伍的曹長，因為日寇偷襲珍珠港，演成菲律濱的侵略戰，乃奮起產呼，招募遊勇，編練民軍，保衛祖國。這一班熱血男兒雖予日寇致命的打擊，但終因眾寡懸殊，壯烈殉難。</p>
<p>烈士們的血肉，當不住敵軍的砲火，但激昂的意氣，已粉碎了日寇的迷夢。他們不但驚破了侵略者的膽魄，更喚醒了一班保衛祖國的人們，奠定了光復故土的命運。</p>
<p>華雷斯皮萊豪爽的個性，在這片中担任的角色的確是很相稱的。那慷慨激昂的動作，很能把握住每幕的劇情。戰爭　的塲面很逼眞，據說是由美國海軍當局合作拍攝的。</p>
<p>在悲壯的故事中，更穿揷着一些小兒女愛戀有故事，好的是，這些並未使主題鬆懈，反增厚了人生的趣味。斐貝英德飾曹長的妻子，表情很細膩，此外飾納粹黨員的雷金勒奧文，飾曹長女兒的瑪麗琳麥克斯惠兒，飾曹長部屬的雷戈林斯，也都很能稱職</p>

<h3 id="c102">雷密倫的成功 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>雷密倫現在是三十八歲，他結婚已十四年了，夫人名曼莉蕙白，一個銀髮紫蘭色眼睛的淑女，他們已有一個結晶品，今年五歲，是一個男孩子名叫德尼（Danery）家庭間為融洽。</p>
<p>上面是當今好萊塢第一紅星；一九四五年度「奧斯卡」金像勻的得主的最近家庭狀況。當雷未曾進好萊塢之前他攻讀於劍橋的皇家學院，後來他還在華爾斯大學研究機械工程，歷時一年。但是他覺得孤獨，旣沒有跳舞，又沒有騎馬，更沒有野外的擲射，所以他靜極思動，說出：「六六制」的希望，就是六年應負起責任的求智識，六年應向外活動，向外工作，所以雷二十一歲的時候，就離開學校，到巴黎去嬉戲，玩兒。從這幾點看來，都能想到雷是一個十足的好動者。就在那年他結識了一個英國女伶，欲想獻身於舞台，但受到了此女伶的拒絕。後經白露蒂小姐的紹介，終於達到了雷的志願，向好萊塢去。而好萊塢亦認識了此具有天才的明星。然而好萊塢的明星亦都不是一飛沖天的，經過了長時期的努力，發展，才會成功，雷密倫亦不出其例。</p>
<p>您看在「Ambassador　Bill」「Were　Not　Dressing」二片之中不是只有一個極不重要的配角給了演嗎？直到和克勞黛考爾白合演「時代兒女」，桃樂珊拉摩合演「獸國女皇」纔漸露頭角，至「野風」「陸軍少校與未成年者The　Major　And　the　Minor」剛為人注意，直到演出了失去的週末（The　Lost　Weekend）為大眾一致贊美，一致欽佩其演技的老練，精湛。在此片中他飾一個酒徒，演得維妙維肖，生龍活虎。而從此亦奠定了他的基礎，前途。所以現在派拉蒙公司正萬分的倚重他，今年已有了四張片子由他主演，一，和寶蓮高黛合演古裝愛情巨片“The　Trouble　with　Women”三，和娣麗莎拉埃脫合演“The　Imperfect　Lady”四，和白蓓蘭史丹妃合演武俠五影彩片「加里福尼亞」“California”上海的影迷們且等待着各片的運滬，拭目而視罷！</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The twenty-odd members of the 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 4th groups dispatched to the Northeast by the Executive Headquarters, comprised of government and American personnel, led by Colonel Dutelot, flew to Shenyang this morning aboard an American transport plane. The personnel from the Chinese Communist side have not yet been fully assembled from various locations due to weather conditions and will depart a day or two later. Thirteen Chinese and foreign journalists will also fly to various locations on the 1st of next month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] Twenty-six government and American representatives of the 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 4th groups of the Military Mediation Department arrived here this afternoon from Ping by seven planes and are staying at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The Communist representatives have not yet arrived.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 30th] The four mobile groups of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation flew from Beiping this morning in seven American Army transport planes piloted by Americans to Shenyang, hoping to facilitate peace in the Northeast. It is expected that the Executive Headquarters will hold its first meeting in Shenyang this afternoon, at which time the Executive Group personnel will consult with Brigadier General Byrd, who flew to Shenyang yesterday to arrange mediation work. The seven transport planes carried all the personnel of the four groups, including secretaries, translators, jeeps, trailers, and emergency supplies. On the clearest day in several weeks, they flew to Shenyang successively from 10:00 AM to 10:35 AM. Each group is composed of one representative from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States. The four American representatives are Colonel Dutelot, Colonel Cooley, Colonel Davenport, and Lieutenant Colonel Drake. The total number of personnel in the four groups is sixty, plus twelve American junior officers and soldiers serving as radio operators, secretaries, and translators. Each group is equipped with a mobile radio transceiver. Colonel Dutelot of the mobile group will remain in Shenyang, which seems to have become the Northeast branch of the Executive Headquarters. The other three groups will go to outlying areas but maintain radio contact with Shenyang. It is not yet known where the Executive Group will go, but according to observations here, the groups will go to areas where there is a risk of war as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 30th] The American representative of the Liaocheng Provisional Executive Group, Harold, the government representative Gu Zili, and the Communist representative Yu Yixing, recently went to Liucheng again to meet with Zhu Ziwei, the deputy commander of the First Military District of the Central Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. The Chinese Communists refused to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal and instead focused on the discussion of free trade for the people. The Chinese Communists agreed to discuss it but insisted on opening all four gates of Liaocheng. The National Army in the city agreed to open the west gate, but the Communist Army insisted on opening the east gate, so no agreement was reached. Gunfire is frequently heard inside and outside Liaocheng every evening after dusk, but order within the city is still maintained.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 30th] The Wuhan Executive Group previously went to mediate a conflict near Ying Mountain, which was resolved satisfactorily and returned to Hankou. Due to renewed disputes in Anlu and Huang'an, they will fly to inspect the area within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Chongqing News. Military sources report that the Communist Army in Northern Chahar, Northern Hubei, and Southern Henan has taken advantage of the National Army's troop reorganization to launch offensives, disregarding the ceasefire order. According to reliable reports, the Communist Army has forcibly conscripted 100,000 men in the above areas. The Communist Army troops who have been harassing the Anhui border from Southern Henan in recent days are mostly newly formed troops and include puppet troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th] The three-party representatives of the Taiyuan Central Group of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation returned to Bing on the 29th via Laiyuan special train. This trip to Eastern Qin Line for mediation lasted six days. Upon arrival at Laiyuan, the situation there was very serious. After the three-party representatives made their best efforts, they convened a meeting of the military leaders of both sides on the 25th, and an agreement was reached on issues such as ceasing conflict, implementing isolation, and exchanging prisoners. The serious situation on the Eastern Qin Line is gradually clearing up. Some issues that have not been agreed upon will be referred to the Beiping Military Mediation Department and handed over to the Eastern Qin Group.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] More than a thousand Communist troops in the Luoshan area of Southern Henan, in violation of the agreement, scurried towards central Anhui on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Military sources report that the 19th Military District of the Communist Army in Northern Chahar is currently transferring the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the Communist Army from the Chahar-Suiyuan border to launch a fierce attack on the National Army Zhang Tianfang's troops stationed near Huailai and Huai'an.</p>

<p>Guangzhou City is Peaceful and Tranquil, War Criminal Ximen Will Be Escorted to Chongqing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] Statement by Zhang Fakui, Director of the Xingying (Provisional Headquarters): (1) Troop reorganization has already begun, and there are already arrangements for the reassignment of surplus officers. In the past two weeks, military discipline inspections have been carried out, and the largest number of detainees are police officers, followed by local teams and troops. This shows that the quality of military discipline is greatly related to treatment, so I have proposed that military personnel must receive higher pay equal to that of civil officials. (2) In recent months, there have been no bandits entrenched in the Xingying's jurisdiction, only a few who have fled to the border areas of Hunan and Jiangxi. Public security in this city has not yet reached an ideal state, but order in the city is more peaceful. (3) The Japanese prisoners will be completely repatriated before April 15th. According to the promulgated list, there are eight batches of war criminals here, totaling 112 people. Sixty-five have been arrested. German spy Otto and Italian female spy Bianca have both been arrested. Traitor war criminal Ximen has also been interrogated by the Xingying and may be escorted to Chongqing for handling. As for political prisoners, the Xingying has never arrested anyone other than traitors. I have never interfered with personal beliefs. If the Xingying arrests or fails to release political prisoners, I will be responsible for violating national laws. (4) The wages and food expenses of requisitioned employees have been increased, and will be increased or decreased from time to time according to the price index in the future. At the same time, in order to quickly restore transportation in South China, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been requested to dispatch the Hai Kang, Hai E, and Hai Bai, three large transport ships, to regularly sail along the coastal lines of South China.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Yan'an, 30th] According to friends of CCP Chairman Mao Zedong, Mao is not likely to actively participate in politics within a year due to poor health. In the past six months, CCP political affairs have been presided over entirely by Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi. Due to health reasons, Mao is not planning to take on important positions in the coalition government, and even the most important meetings of the Politburo are currently not attended by Mao. Mao's condition has recently improved, and is currently being treated by several Soviet doctors.</p>

In addition, in order to eliminate the malpractices of purchasing military and prisoner food, the Hankou City has recently established a Military Prisoner Food Audit Committee.</p>

Tomorrow, Sunday, three-party personnel from the Executive Headquarters will take the train to Qinglongqiao to visit the Great Wall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 30th] North of Yancheng on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, under the supervision of the 23rd Transportation Group, repairs have now been completed to Wangjiazhuang, advancing two kilometers and leaving six kilometers to Yucheng. The project continued as usual yesterday despite it being a day off. Currently, the progress of the project is less than 800 meters of repaired section per day. It is expected that it will still take ten days to reach Yucheng. On the southern section, repairs have been completed to Yunting, advancing just over one kilometer and leaving seven kilometers to Dawenkou, and repairs are continuing. After repairing to Xindian on the Jiaoji Railway, the Communist Army stopped the repairs, and a solution has not yet been found.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 30th] It has recently come to light, according to sources from certain parties, that if the railway repair project in Shandong Province were carried out according to the government's original plan, as of now, it could have been repaired as far south as Yanzhou, as far north as Dezhou, and as far east as Weixian. Due to the influence of the Communist Army's constant introduction of new issues, the project has been intermittent. To date, the total length of the repaired section is less than 20 kilometers. As for the material aspect, the Road Administration originally estimated a maximum loss of about 20 percent, but the actual situation is the opposite. Since the resumption of road repairs, the steel rails, railroad ties, and other materials that the Communist Army removed and stored have never been handed over at all. Therefore, when the repair project continues in the future, the lack of equipment will still be a major problem.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] (Delayed) Lieutenant General Kyuichi Tanaka, the head of the Japanese military and civilian liaison department here, has been listed as the 52nd war criminal in the third batch by the Military Commission. The Guangzhou Xingying was ordered to detain him on the 27th. The criminal was originally the commander of the Japanese "23rd" Army and was notoriously guilty of killing civilians and looting property in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian and along the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway and the Vietnam-Burma Road from June 1940 to June 1943. When he was detained, the criminal entrusted Captain Li of the Xingying's Anti-Enemy Broadcasting Team to forward his personal letter to Director Zhang. The letter roughly stated that the Japanese prisoners had been successively repatriated to their country and that his mission was also completed. He deeply repented of his past actions and was now awaiting punishment without complaint.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] As the National Congress is about to be convened, the National Government, in view of the actual difficulties faced by the provinces and cities that have not yet held National Congress elections, most of which have failed to elect representatives in time, has changed its approach and will have the National Government select them.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] According to sources involved, the National Army, centered on Shenyang, is currently advancing in a radiating manner towards the areas withdrawn by the Soviet Army. The National Army northeast of Shenyang is advancing along the Changchun Railway and has reached Tieling, pressing towards Kaiyuan. Once the Soviet Army withdraws from Changchun, there should be no problem with taking over Changchun. The National Army south of Shenyang is pointing towards Yingkou in a pincer formation, advancing along the Tianzhuangtai branch line of the Beining Railway. It has already approached the outskirts of Yingkou a few days ago. The National Army may have already entered Yingkou today, but the authorities have not yet released any information on this. Another route is going south along the Changchun Railway, passing Anshan and pointing towards Yingkou from the northeast. The newly recovered areas by the National Army in the Northeast, such as Liaoyang and Anshan, have been severely damaged. There are over 30 factories in Liaoyang waiting to be taken over, but many machines are missing. The famous iron ore mine in Anshan has also suffered heavy losses.</p>

However, County Magistrate Wang Yingmin and 50 employees have been captured by the Communist Army, and their whereabouts are still unknown. In other news, the Communist Army is currently gathering its forces south of Gongzhuling towards Changtu, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive to prevent government troops from moving north to take over.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The most concerning issue for people here now is whether the National Army advancing north from Shenyang can reach Changchun before the Soviet Army completely withdraws. The Communist Army around Changchun is gradually gathering and intensifying its economic blockade.</p>

It is reported that a portion of the Soviet Army has been transferred back to Siberia, but the majority of the Soviet Army leaving the Northeast is heading to Korea, which has aroused the concern of the Chinese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union is greatly strengthening its presence in Lushun and Dalian. According to authoritative sources here, although there are currently no signs that the Soviet Union is not complying with the agreement to complete the withdrawal before May, President Chiang is deeply concerned about the Soviet actions in concentrating in Korea.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Awaiting Direct Reply from the Soviet Union: Security Council Adjourns for Four Days, Iranian Representative Demands Soviet Guarantee of Troop Withdrawal, Bevin to Personally Travel to the US if Necessary <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 30th (Broadcast): It was reliably learned from diplomatic sources here today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently telegraphed US Secretary of State Byrnes, stating that if the crisis in the Security Council threatens the existence of the United Nations, he will travel to New York. Bevin stated that due to his busy schedule, he does not intend to leave London at present, but if the situation urgently requires a trip to New York, he will depart immediately upon notification.</p>
<p>[United Press, 29th] In an effort to break the deadlock caused by the Soviet Union's boycott of meetings, the United Nations Security Council unanimously decided today to directly request Moscow and Tehran to report on the Soviet-Iranian dispute and set a deadline of next Wednesday for a response. This was proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, and the key question was whether the Soviet promise to withdraw troops was contingent on agreements regarding other matters. Australia proposed that the deadline for the response should be Wednesday or Thursday, but Byrnes argued for an earlier deadline of next Tuesday. Ultimately, under the guidance of Mr. Guo Taiqi, who was present, it was decided to set the deadline for Wednesday. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and the letter requesting a response from the Soviet Union and Iran was sent out half an hour later. Today was the third meeting that the Soviet representative had not attended. The Security Council had decided at a closed-door meeting on Thursday that the meetings would continue even in the absence of the Soviet representative. Byrnes stated that if the Security Council could obtain more comprehensive information, it could be certain that the withdrawal of Soviet troops was in fact unconditional. Immediately after Byrnes finished his speech, British representative Cadogan expressed his agreement. Byrnes's proposal seemed to be forcing a showdown with the Soviet Union, attempting to determine how long it would take and to what extent the Soviet Union would deny the Security Council access to information regarding the situation in Iran. However, as the Soviet representative was not present, it was impossible to make a verbal request directly. The US motion was intended to test the Soviet Union's reaction to a written statement, in order to determine whether the Soviet Union would also boycott this. During today's meeting, Polish representative Lange asked how the Iranian Prime Minister was able to travel to Moscow a few weeks ago, given that the Iranian constitution stipulates that no negotiations can take place while foreign troops remain in the country. Iranian Ambassador to the US Ala replied that the Prime Minister went to Moscow to seek an end to Soviet interference in Iranian affairs and urged Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov to pay attention to the continued presence of Soviet troops in Iran, as such a situation would lead to continued chaos. Although the Prime Minister enjoyed numerous banquets in Moscow, there were no concessions made.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 30th] Iranian representative Ala stated at the United Nations Security Council open meeting last night that the Soviet Union should provide the Council with an unconditional guarantee that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Iran within the specified timeframe. Last night's meeting lasted three hours and forty-eight minutes. Ala declared at the meeting that no official or other information had been received regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran into Soviet territory.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] According to authoritative Soviet sources today, the Soviet Union believes that the Security Council's actions regarding the Iranian issue are "unfriendly," and Soviet personnel feel that the United States may not want the two countries, Iran and the Soviet Union, to resolve various issues through direct negotiations. The Soviet reaction strongly indicates that the Soviet Union will refuse to provide the information requested by the Security Council. When asked if the Soviet Union would continue to trust the UN organization, they replied, "Of course! Stalin made it clear that the Soviet Union trusts the UN organization in a talk on March 22."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] Former US Ambassador to China Hurley stated in a speech at the Joint Air Defense Conference hosted by the National Aviation Association today that we once told US soldiers to fight for certain doctrines and goals, but to this day, the United States has tacitly agreed to abandon these doctrines and goals. The sacred provisions of the Atlantic Charter have been violated and discarded. Major powers have clearly shown that what they need is US money, materials, and military power, but they disregard US ideals and goals, which they had previously agreed to. China is the only country that has not abandoned these ideals and goals. The State Department has agreed to give all lend-lease materials to other countries and sell off overseas army equipment, but I advocate that the United States should immediately recover these materials. US weapons should be used by the international police of UN organizations. The US military organization has gradually become weak and incompetent. The Army, Navy, and Air Force should be merged into one national defense agency, and future military plans should not be limited to men, but should also include women, and military thinking should be refreshed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Atlantic City, 29th (United Press)] At the conclusion of the three-week UNRRA Council meeting here, LaGuardia told the participating representatives that President Truman is determined to fully support the work of UNRRA and is willing to save the world from disaster to the best of its ability. Like his predecessor Lehman, LaGuardia called for the United States to restore food rationing and pointed out that the food wasted in New York alone is enough to feed 350,000 people. LaGuardia emphasized the need for recipient countries to eliminate the black market and assured that UNRRA stands outside the political vortex. "We will never approach people with a ballot box in one hand and food in the other." LaGuardia said that he will assume office on April 1.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Control of Atomic Energy Power: US Atomic Energy Commission Suggests Handing Over to the International Atomic Energy Agency <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th (United Press)] The US State Department Atomic Energy Commission submitted a 25,000-word report to Secretary of State Byrnes, suggesting that the power to control atomic energy for peaceful and progressive purposes should be handed over to the International Atomic Energy Development Commission under the United Nations Organization. The report stated that it is not advisable to have an international police force control atomic energy to prevent its use in war, and that only by giving the International Atomic Energy Development Agency the power to control atomic energy raw materials and even factories producing atomic energy, can it be effective. The State Department reiterated that the above report and recommendations are only drafts and not final plans.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] US Senators Austin and Hoffman stated today that they oppose the disclosure of information about atomic energy until absolute guarantees are obtained that atomic energy will not be used for war. The two's position clearly clashes with the State Department's plan to establish an international atomic energy development agency. Hoffman said that unless all countries within UN organizations treat the United States with the same open-mindedness, we will not disclose the slightest secret about atomic energy.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Democratic Senator Huff Monn today proposed a bill to directly cancel atomic bomb tests on Bikini Atoll. It is said that this does not indicate a lack of martial spirit. Canceling the tests is fundamentally justified. The United Nations organization is still in its infancy, and making large-scale preparations for a future war is incompatible with the purpose of the United States or any other country. It is also inconceivable that the United States would even indicate its willingness to prepare for atomic warfare in the distant future.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Far Eastern Commission Cables MacArthur, Advocates Postponement of Japanese General Election, Expresses Doubt About Several Points in Japanese Draft Constitution, Holds Special Meeting Yesterday to Discuss MacArthur's Reply <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] According to authoritative reports, the Far Eastern Commission sent two notes to MacArthur, "containing accusatory language," requesting that he provide details on the ratification of the Japanese Constitution and the reasons for allowing Japan to hold a general election on April 10. According to one authoritative source, "The wording of the notes is extremely careful, but it still expresses the committee's dissatisfaction with MacArthur's decision to make policy decisions without consulting the committee." In the first note, the committee requested that MacArthur explain whether the Japanese people understand that MacArthur's approval of the new Japanese Constitution may not be the final decision. The second note requested that MacArthur announce the reasons for his permission to hold elections on April 10 and why it cannot be postponed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The Japanese election is scheduled for April 10. The Far Eastern Commission members suggested a postponement, and MacArthur has replied. A special meeting will be held tomorrow to study it. According to diplomatic sources, the commission's cable to MacArthur is sufficient to reflect the views of some members, because the Japanese people are not familiar with democratic habits, and there are concerns about whether they can fully express their opinions in the election on April 10. It is said that several committee members did express doubts about several points in the proposed constitution. The committee was organized in accordance with the conditions announced by the three foreign ministers in Moscow in December last year, and it adopts a strict policy of secrecy. Its organizational basis is roughly based on the United Nations Security Council, with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China having veto power over policy directives, but France does not. The cable to MacArthur this time was likely obtained with the unanimous agreement of the four countries' committee members.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Discussing the Implementation of the New Land Policy (Part 1) <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Qiwu</p>
<p>In the political report resolution passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the eighth item regarding the vigorous implementation of policies, "Immediately stipulate the implementation steps and methods for 'land to the tiller,' the government shall issue land value bonds, purchase land from large landlords, distribute it to demobilized soldiers and poor farmers, earnestly support self-cultivating farmers, and protect tenant farmers." Although this decision seems to be just old news, it also shows that the Kuomintang already feels that the rural land problem has reached the point where it must be resolved quickly. This is truly the greatest problem for national construction in the future! It is also the most urgent problem!</p>
<p>Originally, more than three-quarters of our country's population are farmers, and the agricultural problem is the focus of the entire economic problem, and the solution of the land problem is a prerequisite for solving the agricultural problem. The main reason for internal strife and revolutions in China throughout history has often been the result of farmer unrest caused by unstable living conditions. Mencius said: "Benevolent government must begin with the establishment of boundaries. If the boundaries are not correct, the land will not be equal, and the salaries will not be fair. Therefore, tyrannical monarchs and corrupt officials must blur their boundaries. Once the boundaries are corrected, the division of land and the system of salaries can be determined while sitting down." Although these are words from the feudal era, his true insight has thoroughly explained the importance of the land problem. In short, the solution of the land problem has always been valued by successive dynasties in our country. If the solution is appropriate, the people will live in peace and the society will be stable; otherwise, there will be chaos. During the eight-year War of Resistance, the whole country, from top to bottom, realized that our country failed to establish light and heavy industries early on, and therefore wasted many heavy prices. After a long period of sacrifice, we were able to achieve final victory. This kind of realistic lesson forces the government and the public to unite and realize that post-war China must be industrialized. However, it must be known that the foundation of industrialization must be built on a broad agriculture. Only then will the sources of industrial raw materials be not scarce, and the industrial products will also have a broad agricultural market to sell. If the land problem cannot be reasonably resolved, agricultural production cannot be increased, and rural areas cannot be stable and prosperous, the purchasing power of most farmers will be extremely weak. Then, not only will the so-called "industrialization" be a castle in the air, without any basis, but also the result of letting some industrial and commercial sectors develop abnormally will lead to the struggle for raw materials and markets, causing greater crises, and even causing the country to go the wrong way, resulting in disaster, just like the past of Japan. Wallace said: "The strong industrial power of the United States was originally built on a broad countryside." At the beginning of national construction, with everything waiting to be done, the government is planning for long-term peace and stability. Reiterating this famous saying of the former Vice President of the United States should have profound significance. Any land system must have its time and space. A system that is effective in one country may not be effective in another country; similarly, a system that is very effective in one era may have the opposite result when implemented in another era. Therefore, the method of studying and solving the land problem cannot stick to the established rules of the ancients, or simply copy the superficial aspects of foreign countries, forcing ancient and modern China and foreign countries into one pattern. However, the occurrence of a country's land problem must have its historical origin and background, and whether the method of solving the land problem is appropriate is also related to its current environment and the trend of the world. Therefore, to study and solve the current rural land problem in our country, it is necessary to briefly review history and refer to general international trends and inclinations.</p>
<p>Our country has a long history, and the land problem occurred the earliest. The Zhou Dynasty advocated the well-field system. Mencius said: "A square mile is a well, and a well is 900 acres. The middle is the public field, and eight families each privately have 100 acres, supporting the public field together." The essence of the well-field system is here. Descending to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the population became more numerous, and the powerful and wealthy annexed land. Land was privately owned, and production capacity greatly increased. Qin Shang Yang took advantage of the situation and abolished the well-field system. As a result, land could be openly and freely bought and sold, and the landlord and merchant classes rose one after another, leading to a situation where those with land did not cultivate it, and those who could cultivate it had no land. The gap between the rich and the poor was huge, and society was uneasy. Subsequently, successive rulers mostly paid full attention to the issue of land distribution. Dong Zhongshu's land restriction system in the Han Dynasty, Wang Mang's Wangtian system, Emperor Wu of Jin's land occupation system, Emperor Xiaowen of the Wei Dynasty's equal-field system, the Tang Dynasty's land allocation system, and Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty's equal-field method were all quite acknowledging public ownership of land and using the method of distributing land according to the population (the details were often different). The purpose was to encourage production, prevent annexation, and increase national tax revenue. Here, there is a trend that can be noted, that is, the adjustment of various land systems often occurs at the time of a change of dynasty, after a great chaos, when the population is displaced, and the farmland is barren. The distribution of land according to the population has two major prerequisites: one is that the household registration must be clearly investigated, and the second is that there must be sufficient arable land to allocate. After a great chaos, the population is small, and it is easy to investigate as people are successively appeased and return, and the barren farmland and the land seized from the enemy's order can be re-allocated and supplied without shortage, so the implementation of the new system is always effective at the beginning. As for the destruction of various systems, it mostly occurs when there is a long period of peace, the population increases, the powerful and wealthy gradually annex land, and there is not enough land to distribute. If things are not fair, there will be grievances, so the peasants riot, the order is broken, causing turmoil. As a result, a new dynasty is replaced, and the land is re-adjusted, cycling back and forth, circulating to this day. This is the biggest reason for the one-rule-one-chaos in Chinese history.</p>
<p>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, close to the Republic of China, also tried to implement a land distribution system. The method was to divide the land into nine grades according to the amount of production. Those who received land were distributed according to the number of people, regardless of gender. Each family had half good and half bad land, without differences. The so-called "The land of the world is cultivated by the people of the world together. If it is insufficient here, then move it there. If it is insufficient there, then move it here. Also, the land of the world is connected in barrenness and abundance. If it is barren here, then move it to the abundant place to provide relief here. If it is barren there, then move it to the abundant place to provide relief there." The purpose is to cultivate the land together, eat the food together, wear the clothes together, and use the money together, so that no one is unequal, and no one is not full and warm. In addition to "public land," there is also a method of "equalizing wealth and poverty," with far-reaching intentions. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Kingdom was not established for long, and after its failure, various institutions and cultural relics were thoroughly eliminated by the Qing Dynasty, leaving nothing behind. Therefore, its detailed methods and implementation results, in addition to being able to collect some information from various sporadic records, are almost impossible to see in their entirety.</p>
<p>There is no country in the world that does not have a land problem, but the severity of the problem must be proportional to the population size, land supply, and distribution system. If the population is small and the land is large (such as the tropical, north and south polar regions of Africa, etc.), there will be no problem at all. If there are many people, but the natural land supply is sufficient, or if the area of arable land can be expanded and production can be increased through human efforts and scientific methods, then even if there are problems, they will not be so profound. If the population is dense, the arable land is small, and the distribution system is unreasonable, then it is the most serious. Speaking of the methods of solving the land problem in various countries, there are many differences due to different histories and different national conditions, but looking at the overall trend, it can be roughly divided into two categories: the first is to completely abolish the private ownership of land, completely recover it to the state, and adopt a collective farm system, operating on a large scale with scientific methods, so that agricultural management is industrialized, as implemented by the Soviet Union; the second is to appropriately recognize the private ownership of land, but to restrict management with laws, so that the distribution is more reasonable, to reduce the drawbacks of monopoly and annexation, as implemented by Ireland and Eastern European countries. The first type of public land system originally coincided with the ideal of Chinese history, plus modern technical management (this point was not available in previous dynasties). The second type of system, our land law also has the principles of supporting self-cultivating farmers and limiting land ownership, etc., but unfortunately it has not been implemented so far.</p>
<p>Our country is called a large country with a large population, but in fact, although the land is large, there is not much arable land, and the population is really large. With a large population crowded on a small and limited arable land, production is not enough to supply consumption, plus frequent wars and poor distribution system, so by the eve of the War of Resistance, the land problem was already quite serious, especially in the southeastern region, where the situation of tenancy was particularly bad. The rich had thousands of acres of land, and the poor had no land to stand on. In the past, the government did not have a thorough solution to this, the social divide was obvious, and there were too many people dissatisfied with the status quo, who could cause incidents at any time. The reason why it did not break out was that the general tenants and hired farmers, although they had the same pain, did not have a clear class consciousness, let alone a large organization. During the eight-year War of Resistance, through conscription or involvement in guerrilla work, the opportunities for contact with each other increased day by day. After a long period of training in the army life, the level of knowledge was completely different from before. After returning to their homes, it would be difficult to make these soldiers from the countryside safely go back to their hometowns and restore the original tenant farming life. Moreover, before the war, there were imperialism and its attached feudal forces rampant in the country, and the government had various internal and diplomatic concerns, and sometimes it was really unable to let go and do things. After this eight-year War of Resistance, two-thirds of the country became war zones (including the Northeast), landlords fled, people were displaced, maps were lost, land registration was chaotic, and the original distribution system was completely destroyed. The government should take this opportunity to implement a moderate social revolution before the old order collapses and a new order is established, and thoroughly implement the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang once declared: "The day of victory in the War of Resistance will be a good opportunity to promote the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood." The sixth article of the political program and policies resolved by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang regarding the Principle of People's Livelihood is "In addition to public land, farmland should be implemented with the most rapid and effective method, allowing the tiller to have his own land. All non-self-cultivated land shall be gradually purchased and distributed by the state issuing land bonds." In addition, the "Soldier Land Grant Program" was also passed. These are all expressions of the Changju's determination to implement a new land policy. How should we grasp this golden opportunity that will disappear in a flash, determine a practical and feasible plan, and implement it to lead the country to long-term peace and stability? (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office in China held a joint meeting on the 29th. As a result, it was decided to change the flour handling method from April 1st: (1) Increase the quantity required for free emergency relief and work relief, (2) Stop supplying low-priced sales in this city. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes various grains such as flour, wheat bran, etc. Among them, flour is the most important, the purpose of which is to relieve a large number of poor people with meager incomes. It has been supplied for three months, although it has not been without success, but direct consumers still do not benefit much, and speculators and arbitrageurs abound, making profits in resale, which is very hateful. In view of this, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had to change their methods and decided to stop selling. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Shanghai distributes about 60,000 bags of flour per month for emergency relief and work relief. In the future, it will be increased to 100,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wang Renlin, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sub-Administration, told reporters yesterday that the US military has allocated 10,000 tons of surplus materials of dry milk, which is prepared to relieve children, toddlers, patients, students in various schools, and malnourished poor people in the city.

<p>(Report from this Newspaper) The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council held its first general meeting yesterday morning at 9:15 AM. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan reported: (1) Thirty councilors were present, exceeding the legal quorum. (2) According to a telegram from the Executive Yuan, alternate councilors may attend and observe, but will not receive military horse expenses. (3) Ten proposals have been received. (4) Councilors Shen Chunhui and four others proposed an interim motion regarding the death of Councilor Zhao Zhiqing, suggesting (1) the entire assembly stand in silent tribute for one minute to express condolences, (2) a delegation be sent to comfort the family, and (3) a telegram be sent to the Executive Yuan requesting generous allocation of funeral expenses and a condolence payment, to be handled by the secretariat. This was approved by the entire assembly.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mayor Qian attended and reported on the administrative policy, first offering suggestions. He hoped that the councilors would pay attention to the time issue, noting that although the fourteen-day meeting schedule could be flexible, there were numerous proposals and the examination and discussion would take a long time. He also stated that the Civil Affairs Bureau was a staff agency and not independently established, so it could be included in his report. The Accounting Office was related to finance, so it would be included in the financial report. The Mayor's report was divided into two parts:</p>
<p>General Administrative Overview</p>
<p>Security Issues: In the early days after the recovery of the city, bandits were rampant in the suburbs. However, the garrison troops were mostly of a mobile nature. The municipal government strengthened the police force and restored the organization of the security corps. Initially, there were only more than six thousand regular police officers, which was insufficient. Therefore, a screening and adjustment was made, and a police training school was specially established to train basic cadres, using examinations to select cadres. As a result, significant progress was made in both quality and quantity. The security corps had served the country in the past and made outstanding contributions, and it was indeed necessary to rebuild it. Therefore, the Security Committee was established last November, with a Security Headquarters under it, divided into special affairs and standing brigades. The standing brigade members were recruited, and the city's jurisdiction was divided into eight districts, with a total of 1,309 corps members. There were 13,649 volunteer members. The security corps members lacked sufficient funding for uniforms and expenses. The municipal government was requested to increase the house tax to supplement the funding, and the Security Committee was to be merged into the Security Corps Headquarters. As for the handling of theft cases in the city, the current situation is more progressive than the pre-war concession era. According to statistics, in the public concession from 1939 to 1941, the average number of theft cases in January was 149, February was 123, November was 150, and December was 145. Since the municipal government took over, the number of theft cases has been 142 in November, 132 in December, 106 in January of this year, 96 in February, and 32 in the first half of March. 147 cases were solved, and a total of 427 bandits were captured.</p>
<p>Labor unrest: The living conditions of workers have a significant impact on social order. Since the recovery of the city, labor unrest has occurred continuously. The municipal government attaches great importance to the handling of this matter. Therefore, it was decided to raise wage standards. However, some workers are still engaging in work slowdowns. During strikes, there are often various excessive actions, such as beating factory managers and employees, and even surrounding the Social Affairs Bureau. If such behavior is not punished, it will not only fail to protect social peace but also affect production. Recently, four principles have been decided to handle labor disputes: (1) State-owned enterprises must comply with central regulations and must not engage in work slowdowns or strikes. (2) Work slowdowns and strikes that have not followed legal procedures should be banned. (3) Demands that are unacceptable given the current state of production in China should be rejected. (4) Illegal and excessive actions should be punished.</p>
<p>Garbage Removal: At the beginning of the municipal government's takeover, there were more than 10,000 tons of garbage in the city's streets. Under the supervision of the responsible authorities, 382,661 tons of garbage have been removed in the past six months.</p>
<p>Dredging Ditches: The city was damaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years, roads were damaged, and ditches were silted up. Especially in the western part of Shanghai, the terrain is low-lying, and during the rainy season, accumulated water cannot be discharged. Active efforts are now underway to dredge rivers and ditches.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Before the city's recovery, the central government ordered that public utilities must not be allowed to shut down, so water and electricity were supplied as much as possible. Before the war, there were more than 23,000 street lights in the city, and 8,000 remained during the war. There are now 791 in the old city area and 9,125 in the entire city. In terms of transportation, before the war, there were 28 tram and trolley lines. Before the takeover, 12 lines were operating, and 7 have now been restored. Three public bus lines have now been opened, and the city ferry has restored two long-distance lines and two cross-river lines.</p>
<p>Land Administration Facilities: Although the city had land administration agencies before the war, the land survey and consolidation were not completed. During the occupation period, the land registry became even more chaotic. After the recovery, the municipal government is rectifying the land registry and clearing land taxes.</p>
<p>Eliminating Illiteracy: During the enemy puppet period, the entire education system was designed to enslave the people. Efforts are now being made to restore the original system. Municipal schools that were changed to private schools during the occupation period can be restored to municipal status and expanded. However, illiteracy still accounts for more than 50% of the city's population. Mass literacy schools are now being established.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties: There are still many areas of dissatisfaction in the city's administration. The first reason is financial difficulty. Currently, the city's tax revenue only comes from entertainment, banquets, slaughter, licenses, and house taxes. At this point, the chairman announced a ten-minute break in the meeting, after which the mayor continued his report:</p>
<p>Implementation of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>Establishment of District Offices: District offices have been established throughout the city, divided into 31 districts. Recently, due to requests from the people of the former Zhenru District to restore the district, the number has been increased to 32. Except for Maqiao and Tangwan districts, where offices have not yet been established, the other 30 districts have been established one after another. In terms of funding, each district receives an establishment fee of 500,000 yuan from the municipal government as a one-time payment. The recurring expenses are 1,159,750 yuan per month for Category A districts and 853,180 yuan per month for Category B districts, which are issued by the municipal government on time.</p>
<p>Formation of Baojia: It has been decided that the Baojia organization will adopt a system of 30 households, with each Jia containing no fewer than ten households and each Bao containing no fewer than ten Jia. The reorganization of the Baojia was completed by the end of February. Statistics show that there are a total of 1,025 Bao and 23,850 Jia in the city. The operating expenses of the Bao offices are 81,615.01 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Household Census: The household census was completed on March 17. There are a total of 690,950 households and 3,345,875 people in the city. The department is stepping up efforts to issue national identity cards, conduct background checks on candidates for public office, prepare for the establishment of district people's representative conferences, and prepare for the election of municipal councilors.</p>
<p>Pan Xulun and others propose: Labor unrest must be eliminated first</p>
<p>After the report was completed, Councilor Pan Xulun raised a question, expressing strong support for the four principles decided by the mayor to handle labor unrest. However, he noted that the soaring prices in the city are closely related to the occurrence of labor unrest. Factories are unwilling to resume production, as evidenced by the reduced bidding at the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. This has made the unemployment problem increasingly serious. Factories in the interior are now taking Shanghai's place. The current foreign exchange regulations, which allow for massive imports of American goods, have a major impact on Shanghai's industrial development. Labor unrest must be resolved first. Councilor Wang Bing then stated that factories should pay attention to maintaining order and proposed issuing a declaration to attract social attention. Councilor Zhan Wen believes that production standards should be planned and that the municipal government should find ways to verify whether the production and living index matches the standard. Councilor Wang Genzhong made a speech, stating that the municipal government and its colleagues should not only speak from the perspective of the capitalists but should handle matters fairly and reasonably in accordance with the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo questions the two points of relieving people's difficulties</p>
<p>At this time, Councilor Xu Yongzuo stood up and stated: The procedures stipulated by this council are for the mayor to report, and councilors should submit any discussions and suggestions at the next meeting. Councilor Xu then asked two questions: (1) Reports indicate that the municipal government plans to build a council hall on Linsen Road. He believes that the people are now suffering greatly, and this expenditure should not be made. He requested that these funds be used to solve the people's difficulties. (2) The Municipal Public Works Bureau plans to demolish houses on Zhejiang Road to widen the road, but there is currently an urgent housing shortage, and citizens are displaced. He hoped that the demolition could be postponed for one or two years.</p>
<p>The mayor immediately stood up and replied that the suggestion to build a meeting place was only a suggestion and had not yet been finalized, and the funds had not been raised. As for the demolition of houses on Zhejiang Road, the Municipal Public Works Bureau would respond later. At 11:30, the councilors took a photo in the front courtyard of the building and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, Mayor Qian held a tea party in the auditorium of the Municipal Government to entertain the councilors. More than a hundred people, including councilors, military and political leaders, bureau chiefs, chief editors of newspapers, and reporters, attended. The atmosphere was harmonious and lively, and the party ended at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Councilors discuss various proposals</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Municipal Provisional Councilors Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangxue, Fan Cai, Shen Ding, and Zhao Banfu are very concerned about labor issues. Recently, they received suggestions from various labor unions and intend to submit proposals to the council on their behalf. Yesterday afternoon at 9:00 PM, they met to discuss the content and detailed reasons for the proposals. The main items include: (1) Requesting the government to increase the number of labor union representatives in the National Assembly. (2) Actively implementing worker welfare, including education for workers' children, establishing worker nurseries, etc. (3) Reasonably handling labor disputes. (4) Resolving the livelihood issues of unemployed workers. (5) Stipulating a minimum wage for workers. (6) Requesting that the wage and living index be calculated twice a month, etc.</p>
<p>Councilors Xi Yushu and Wang Bing and others intend to propose: (1) The Enemy Property Administration Bureau's docks and warehouses were previously entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Jianghai Customs for sealing and management. It is now requested that the government order the Jianghai Customs to transfer these docks and warehouses to the municipal government for takeover. (2) Advocate that the stock exchange be reopened immediately and collect exchange taxes separately.</p>
<p>In addition to requesting the government to allocate 30% of the funds to expand education in the city and subsidize private schools, Councilor Zhou Feicheng and others also requested that the government order the return of school buildings occupied by various military agencies, etc.</p>
<p>Municipal Councilors Host Leaders of District Chiefs</p>
<p>Councilors Wang Genzhong, Shen Chunhui, Lu Entan, Cao Shi, and Zhou Feicheng and others are scheduled to hold a tea party at Councilor Wang's residence at 285 Zhao Zhujiao Road at 2:00 PM today to entertain the district chiefs and all Bao chiefs of Taishan, Changshu, Huajiawan, and Xujiahui districts, listen to their statements, and forward them to the Provisional Council for reference. It is reported that the remaining councilors will also continue to hold group meetings. 70,000 citizens of Zhabei have submitted twelve suggestions to the Municipal Provisional Council for relief and revitalization of Zhabei.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Famous French Real Estate Businessman Accused of Endangering the Republic of China: Wrote Articles to Advocate for the Enemy and Puppet Regimes, Debate Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court's Criminal Division, being Sunday today, has no court session as usual. The first two days of the month are also holidays, so yesterday, at the end of this month, the court session was longer. The debate in the case of the French brothers Xavier Arthur and Xavier Dejautel was also opened yesterday. The Xavier brothers grew up in China and are well-known real estate businessmen in Shanghai. Arthur, 49, wore brown clothes; Dejautel, 47, wore black, both were full of energy and physically strong. During the occupation period of Shanghai, the two brothers occasionally wrote articles published in the English-language *North China Daily News*, in which some of the content praised and promoted the enemy and puppet regimes and the puppet Central Reserve Bank of China notes they issued. Because they used their writing to promote the enemy, which was detrimental to our country during the war, the prosecutor charged them with endangering the Republic of China. However, Arthur argued that the brothers' writings were purely based on academic exploration. Because they grew up in Shanghai, they were very interested in Chinese finance. As businessmen, their judgments inevitably came from the interests of businessmen. Therefore, the so-called praise of the enemy and puppet financial policies was not their intention. Their lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, also argued on their behalf that the Xavier brothers' opinions in the newspaper were published earlier than 1935, not after the Japanese occupied Shanghai. Of the 340 articles written in the past eight or nine years, most were about the actual economic problems in Shanghai and were not related to politics or military affairs. Most of them were beneficial to China and not to the enemy and puppet regimes. Therefore, by 1943, the *North China Daily News*, which was controlled by the enemy and puppet regimes, refused to publish their articles. This proves that they had no intention of committing crimes. After the debate, sentencing was scheduled for the 5th of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Impersonated a Reporter to Extort Money from Factory Owner: Reduced from Ten Million to Five Million Yuan, Arrested While Receiving Payment in a Cafe <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At about 4:00 PM on the 25th, a well-dressed young man in a suit suddenly visited Ying Jipin, the owner of the New China Iron Factory at 336 Xiaoshadu Road. He presented a business card with the name Wang Kezhe, a special correspondent for the Shanghai Frontline Daily. Ying had never met him before and refused to meet him. On the afternoon of the 26th, the young man went again but was not met. Before leaving, he threatened that there would be regrets. On the 27th, Ying was summoned by his friend Feng Yuming (manager of Xin Chang Shipyard on South Chengdu Road) as a representative and wired him to have lunch at the C.P.C. cafe on Avenue Joffre at noon. As it turned out, Feng did not go. That evening, Wang called Ying Jipin, saying that the representative Feng had not arrived, showing no sincerity. He then re-appointed him on the phone and agreed to meet at the Shanghai Western Restaurant on Guangdong Road at 9:00 PM that evening. Feng Yuming would still be the sole representative. At that time, Feng and his friend Wang Wengao, who was also serving in a certain military agency, told him that if he was willing to pay a certain amount of money, they could help him make amends and not be prosecuted. At that time, Feng and Wang tried their best to persuade him to help. Later, the young man said that Ying had to pay 10 million yuan in French currency. Feng and Wang said that the asking price was too high and they could not agree to it at once. It was changed to talking at the Royal Cafe at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Taixing Road at 2:00 PM the next afternoon. The two sides met as scheduled. As a result of the negotiations, it was changed to 5 million yuan, and it was agreed to pay the money at the cafe at 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on the 29th. On the morning of the 29th, Ying told his friend Cui Mingsheng about the incident. Cui said that he was familiar with the former *Qian Daily* and would inquire and inform him later. At about 12:00, Ying received a call from Cui saying that there was no reporter surnamed Wang in the newspaper. Then Ying knew that he was impersonating him and reported the information to the Xin Cheng Police Bureau. The police were ordered to go in disguise and pose as customers in the cafe. When Feng Wang and others arrived at the museum, the young man was already there. After pretending to be friendly, he took out a bag of French currency. After he put it in his pocket, the plainclothes police officers arrested him and took him to the branch. According to the confession, he lives at No. 1, Jishanfang, Yin Gui Road, North Sichuan. The police were dispatched to the above-mentioned guard address and seized a handgun and fourteen rifle bullets. It is heard that there are still seven accomplices at large. The branch is still investigating the case.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Pasture Employees Provide Evidence: Shen Wanling Collaborated with the Enemy: Defendant Still Denies Joint Management with Japanese: Seven Traitors Convicted Yesterday <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Criminal Division of the High Court in Tilanqiao opened a collegiate court yesterday afternoon. Because there was a debate in the case of Shen Wanling, the owner of Shengsheng Ranch, the audience was filled with employees of Shengsheng Ranch, totaling more than 80 people, as well as Shen's relatives and friends. Shen's sister, Shen Jiaoyuan, and his wife, Tao Naixiang, and others came by car.</p>
<p>Representatives of all dairy farm employees attend the hearing</p>
<p>Employees from the Kedi Milk Factory, Shanghai Milk Factory, and Xin Sheng Milk Factory also sent representatives to participate in the hearing. Employees of Shengsheng Ranch even printed and distributed written appeals, calling on everyone to punish the traitor. Shen's case was publicly tried on February 19 and March 23. During the trial on the 23rd, Zhang Daode, Huang Jiajin and other employees of Shengsheng Ranch presented various evidence that Shen had collaborated with the enemy in business during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and used milk to support the enemy. Therefore, Shen was brought to court yesterday. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui immediately questioned Shen about the evidence presented by the employees of Shengsheng Ranch and asked if he had anything to say. In addition to denying that he had cooperated with the Japanese in management, Shen Wanling also argued that the ranch had donated milk to the National Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and that he himself had participated in the patriotic activities of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. He insisted that the accusations made against him by the employees of Shengsheng Ranch were obviously due to someone coveting his ranch, so they bought and instigated the ranch employees to report him on charges of treason in order to fulfill their private desires. Shen originally hired three lawyers. Yesterday, lawyer Wang Shanxiang appeared in court to defend him. Wang stated that Shen was purely a businessman, and during the enemy and puppet occupation, his dealings with the enemy were to cope with the environment and were purely from a profit-making perspective. In the end, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and the sentencing was scheduled for the 5th of next month.</p>
<p>The Director of the Puppet Issuing Bureau was sentenced to ten years in prison</p>
<p>In addition, the High Court rendered verdicts in seven cases yesterday: (1) Mao Renyu: Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, sentenced to ten years imprisonment and ten years deprivation of civil rights.

<h3 id="e49">The China Branch of UNRRA Supervises Fan Haibi's Talk: On the Distribution of Relief Supplies to Us, Taking the Restoration of Transportation, Industry, Mining, Fisheries, and Agriculture as a Prerequisite, the Originally Planned Amount is Valued at US$256 Million <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Fan Haibi, Supervisor of the General Accounting Office of the China Branch of UNRRA, arrived in Shanghai on the "Qunxing" passenger plane. Yesterday, a reporter paid a special visit to inquire about the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to our country. He was informed that the UNRRA's relief strategy is that while providing food to disaster areas is important, the fundamental solution lies in striving to restore various facilities such as transportation, industry, mining, fisheries, and agriculture in the affected countries, so that they can be self-reliant. The UNRRA's relief work can also have constructive results.</p>
<p>Therefore, food relief is of secondary importance. Furthermore, reports on the quantity of relief supplies allocated to us by UNRRA may vary slightly from place to place. According to the figures brought by the Communist Party from UNRRA, the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to our country last year, according to the originally planned amount, was valued at US$256 million. This includes: (1) Transportation and telecommunications equipment, US$120 million; (2) Public utility equipment, US$20 million; (3) Construction and industrial equipment, US$5.7 million; (4) Minerals and coal, US$8 million; (5) Machinery repair equipment, US$7.2 million; (6) Fuel and machine oil, US$9 million; (7) Miscellaneous consumer goods (including rice and grain), US$22 million; (8) Chemical materials, etc., US$64 million. The actual distribution amount: (1) accounted for 122%; (5) accounted for 230%; (6) accounted for 154%, all exceeding the originally planned allocation by a large margin. There were also two items that were insufficient, namely (2) accounting for 79% and (4) accounting for 67%. The distribution percentages of other items (3, 7, and 8) have not yet been calculated.</p>
<p>The originally planned allocation for the first half of this year is valued at US$136.7 million. This includes: (1) US$95.3 million; (2) US$9.5 million; (5) US$11.4 million; (4) US$1.5 million; (5) US$1 million; (6) US$6 million; (7) US$5 million; (8) US$11 million. In addition, there is a new item for improving industrial facilities, totaling US$500,000. The total weight of relief supplies in the first half of this year was 692,000 tons. It was also reported that the actual distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to the world (excluding China) last year was very low as a percentage of the originally planned amount. For example, transportation and telecommunications equipment accounted for only 33%, industrial rehabilitation equipment accounted for only 35%, agricultural rehabilitation equipment accounted for only 22%, and food accounted for only 11%.</p>
<p>Pan American Airlines' Flight Plan</p>
<p>Mr. Fan also mentioned the future flight plans of Pan American Airlines. He said that while in the United States, he was informed by the company's staff that they planned to establish a central Pacific air route between the United States and the Far East. Once they have obtained a sufficient number of "Qunxing" passenger planes, they can open regular flights. Before the Pacific War, the company used Clipper flying boats to fly to the Far East. However, those aircraft were too slow and are no longer suitable. The company will have three routes related to the Far East. In addition to the original route via Manila, the central route will start from San Francisco, via Honolulu, Wake Island, Tokyo, and reach Shanghai. The northern route is the shortest, passing through Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The "Qunxing" passenger plane has a speed of 300 miles per hour, weighs 52,000 pounds, and has a maximum passenger capacity of 54 people. Mr. Fan has lived in China for many years. Before the war, he was the editor of the "China Magazine." From 1938 to 1942, he worked in the International Propaganda Department of the Ministry of Information and is fluent in Mandarin.</p>

<p>The Mission of the Cultural Work Committee for Japan</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Cultural Work Committee for Japan of the Ministry of Information held a reception for the press yesterday afternoon. Committee members Luo Kedian and Zou Renzhi successively reported on the organization process of the committee and the general re-education work for Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates. It was stated that most of the prisoners of war remaining in China currently do not understand the cause and effect of this defeat and still harbor hatred. Therefore, in addition to explaining the purpose of our country's resistance and future national policies in writing, the committee also holds weekly symposiums or gatherings for music, literature, art, and drama to promote their understanding of our country. Subsequently, Secretary-General Tsubaki Shu of the Japan National Revolutionary Comrades Association was introduced. The Comrades Association was established on September 14, 1944, and assisted the United Nations in the war against Japan during the War of Resistance. It currently has more than 600 members and will soon return to the country to engage in the construction of a new democratic Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Electricity Consumption Increases Sharply After the Abolition of the Tiered System <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Power Company Seeks to Increase Production</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the abolition of the tiered electricity system, the amount of electricity used in this city has increased sharply. American-owned Shanghai Power Company is now working hard to find ways to increase production. According to the person in charge of the company, it will soon be increased to a maximum of 123,000 kilowatts. Most of the electricity in this city is supplied by Shanghai Power Company, except for a small portion supplied by the French-owned Water and Electricity Company. Its electricity consumption is 118,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>Power Company Overwhelmed</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau recently convened various electric companies, including American, French, Chinese, Zhabei, and Pudong, to discuss the allocation of electricity supply in the city to reduce the power generation burden of Shanghai Power Company. This is because the company suffered heavy losses during the war, and it will not be able to fully recover within a year. The current power generation capacity is only one-third of its peak period. Before the war, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company could generate 38,000 kilowatts, Chinese Electric Company had 16,000 kilowatts, and Pudong Electric Company also had 500 kilowatts, but they were all destroyed in the war. Therefore, the power generation burden of Shanghai Power Company is even heavier.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Various Parties Intend to Push Up Prices: Bond Prices Rebound and Rise Again. Chinese Stocks Mostly Remain Stationary. Foreign Stocks in the Paper Industry See the Strongest Uptick <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Although there is no official trading of public bonds, the quoted prices are trending upwards due to attempts by some stronger entities to push them up. Although the Overseas Chinese Building is no longer suitable for use, some businesses are moving back to their original locations. Class C bonds were initially quoted at 3,300 yuan for sale, but with no buyers, they were sold at a lower price. Only when the price dropped to around 3,050 yuan were there buyers. Many parties, seeing that the low price would be detrimental to the settlement of accounts, then took the opportunity to push the price up again, rising to over 3,450 yuan before leveling off slightly. There were very few transactions in the middle. As a result, the price of miscellaneous brands fell slightly compared to before the close, while Class C bonds rose slightly. Major players in the Chinese stock market were unanimously taking a break, with only very scattered transfers. Quoted prices varied by the popularity of each stock, with small declines by grade. Foreign stocks initially saw both rises and falls, but sentiment was stable due to the official announcement of the amendment to the Company Law, which is beneficial to foreign businesses. The general mentality was to choose cheaper stocks, leading to a sudden increase in the number of buyers for paper stocks, which have always been on par with Jardine Brewery. The stock price jumped by nearly 20%. Other small stocks received some support and were also slightly lifted. Steel stocks, which had been very active in recent days, were slightly paused yesterday, with prices falling back to level. Other rises and falls were minor. Near noon, a certain company that operated Western-style stores, known for stomach-strengthening products, had almost exhausted the purchase of popular stocks, and then closed at a high price. As a result, compared to before the close, only paper stocks rose by over 20%, Jardine Brewery and Asiatic Petroleum by about 10%, Jardine Spinning by half a percent, and British American Tobacco, Wheelock, and Jardine Matheson were flat. Steel stocks, on the other hand, fell back by a little over half a percent.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Revised Exchange Method for US Dollar Bonds and Savings Certificates <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The method for exchanging US Dollar Bonds and matured interest, as well as US Dollar Savings Certificates, issued by the government in 1942, will be revised according to Article 8 of the Foreign Exchange Management Regulations: (1) Holders of the above-mentioned bonds can sell the bonds and their coupons to the Central Bank and other designated banks to exchange for national currency or use them as legal foreign exchange payments. (2) The Central Bank and other designated banks that accept the exchange of bonds and coupons should include them in the US Dollar account. (3) The exchange of bonds and interest is limited to domestic transactions and cannot be negotiated for direct payment of US Dollars in the United States. The Central Bank has notified American banks to implement the regulations accordingly. At the same time, the payment of principal and interest on US Dollar Savings Certificates must still comply with the restrictions of the US law freezing foreign funds. Furthermore, according to the addendum to Article 20 of the Supplementary Regulations for the Management of Foreign Exchange, holders can sell the bonds and their coupons to the issuing banks, or after verification by the banks, sell them to the Central Bank, or use them directly as foreign exchange as stipulated. Bonds held by enemy and puppet forces will not be exchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Decided on Handling Lost Gold Certificates <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The handling method for lost gold certificates has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office as follows: (1) After a gold certificate (including gold deposit certificates, legal tender converted gold deposit certificates, and futures receipts) is reported lost in accordance with banking practice, it will be handled in accordance with the provisions of this method. (2) For certificates with a retained seal, after the loss report has expired, the applicant for the loss report should fill out an application form for reissuing the certificate, invite a reputable guarantor to provide a guarantee letter, and after review, a new certificate will be reissued. (3) If the original depository bank deems that the above-mentioned lost certificate is questionable, it may order the applicant for the loss report to apply to the competent court for legal determination before handling it. (4) Before a new certificate is reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original depository bank discovers the original certificate, it should temporarily suspend the exchange and notify the person who reported the loss to negotiate with the certificate holder as soon as possible. After negotiation and settlement or a court ruling, it can be handled according to the method agreed by both parties or the final court judgment. (5) If a new certificate has been reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original certificate is discovered by the original depository bank before it has been exchanged, the holder of the original certificate should apply to the local court to allow the new certificate to be provisionally disposed of and notify the original depository bank to stop the exchange; otherwise, the original depository bank will still exchange it based on the new certificate. (6) Regardless of whether a new certificate has been reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original certificate is discovered, the original depository bank may, depending on the circumstances, detain it and issue a detention receipt, or simply stamp the words "This certificate has been reported lost, please negotiate with the applicant for the loss report" on the original certificate to prevent continued circulation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yarn and Cotton Both Rise; Guangdong Merchants Trade the Most <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market saw a turnaround yesterday, with strong purchasing interest from Guangdong merchants. 20-count Shuangma yarn traded up to 1.234 million, closing 100,000 higher than before the Youth Day holiday. Other high-end goods such as Dafa Jincheng and other heavy-weight yarns also jumped by 70,000 to 80,000. Ordinary 20-count yarn followed suit, rising by 20,000 to 30,000. Most of the trading was by buyers from Guangdong and Guangxi, followed by inland merchants. Weavers and sock manufacturers remained inactive, so the increase in fine yarn and double-thread yarn was limited.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph soared by 62 to 66 points, with nearby futures at US$27.79 and distant futures at US$27.67. There is still no market for Middling spot cotton. The local cotton market is optimistic, as holders of spot cotton, seeing the rising prices of foreign cotton and the strong yarn prices, are holding on tightly to their goods, making negotiations difficult to approach. Therefore, there were no transactions for spinning and weaving companies and private yarn factories. Only some traders did a little business, with prices up by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to before the holiday.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Silk Trading Becomes Active <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 120-count artificial silk "Inubashi" opened at 1.65 million yuan, with quite a bit of trading. The price rose to 1.7 million yuan at the close, up 90,000 yuan from Thursday. No trading was done for raw silk of foreign firms. Raw silk "Shuangma" (five piculs), headed at a transaction price of 1.85 million yuan and then repriced to 1.75 million yuan. Qianjing had no transactions. In the silk fabric market, American-Asian bedspreads were up 30,000 yuan from Thursday. Dachen checkered crepe de chine was up 100 yuan per yard. The delivery date for the traded goods for those prices is on Monday at 3,850 per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Woolen Fabrics Remain Stiff <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market remains similar to before. The prices of various goods have not changed much. Light-colored spring thin flannels and summer goods of various colors remain stiff. Dark-colored thick woolen fabrics for autumn and winter sales are less active because new goods are expected to arrive in the future, so buyers are less interested. Recently, the woolen fabric and clothing industry in Nanjing has been quite developed. Many powerful members of the industry have successively developed in the capital city and opened branch stores.</p>

<p>The rice market is experiencing clear weather, abundant sources, and sluggish digestion. The prices of Geng and Xian rice are gradually declining by about a little over a thousand yuan. Yinbai rice continued to fall by two thousand yuan, with few buyers. Yongbang flour is slightly inquired, but the market is very weak. The market shape is still shrinking, and prices are slightly down by 200 yuan, with a dull trend. Bran is stable. The oil market has various sources of supply, with the most abundant arrivals from Qingdao. Sales are flat, and prices are falling day by day, down another two thousand yuan. Soybean trading is sparse, but corn is rare and strong. Raw peanuts are also somewhat flat and weak. Soybean cake fell back by a hundred yuan. All grains are temporarily in a downward trend.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the rice market news, there were more than 8,000 piculs of rice arriving in this city yesterday. The types and quantities are as follows: Bai Geng 4,084 piculs, Du Xian 937 piculs, Bao Dao 912 piculs, Bai Yuan 20 piculs, Zao Dao 2,142 piculs, Yin Yuan 183 piculs, Yang Jian 445 piculs.</p>

<p>Since the new Shui Dongzhi came out, transportation has been inconvenient, and there has been a long lack of shipments. It is now learned that the shipping company has transferred a batch of more than 50 boxes from Hong Kong. Due to the port transfer, a tax on imported goods had to be added, resulting in higher costs and no guaranteed profits. It has now been opened for sale at a price of 85,500 yuan. After the brokers purchase it, they must be sorted and picked, and the sale is expected to be at prices of 100,000 or higher.</p>

<p>The gold market is gradually softening in a calm state. Holders are selling off one after another. The general trend is hopeless. The Bank of China's assigned price is still 1.6 million, but registrants have disappeared for many days. At the opening this morning, it was around 1.56 million, but after the opening, it was consistently overwhelmed by sellers. Support was lacking. Although the volume of transactions was limited, people's hearts were disheartened. Gold long-term loans have approached the bottom price. At the end of the month, some do not intend to renew and are settling. In the afternoon, it once fell below the 1.5 million mark, and then slightly stabilized. As a result, it fell another 25,000 compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was 166,000. Sycee silver remained unchanged. Silver dollars were also stable. The black market interest rate loosened and then tightened slightly, from 1.6 to 2 jiao after interest.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies, U.S. dollars, were also stimulated by the gold market and continued to trend downwards. At the opening this morning, it was around 1,970 yuan. This price was supported for a while. 50-yuan bills and large bills were more than 50 yuan lower than the market price. Demand was lacking. In the afternoon, it almost approached the 1,900 yuan mark, and then slightly stabilized, down 50 yuan compared to the closing price before the break. Old Hong Kong bills were flat. New bills wanted to float up but stopped again. As a result, they finally fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Hong Kong Telecom rose slightly to 440 yuan, and Robbie was 540 yuan.</p>

<p>The coal market for all types of white coal is sluggish and transactions are scarce. Yangquan screened lumps are quoted at 600,000 yuan, but there are no buyers. The trend of bituminous coal is relatively stable. Although the weather is clear, many of the firewood and charcoal arrivals are still damp, and sales remain sluggish. Yesterday, several boats of dry anti-white firewood from Meixi arrived in Shanghai. Large pieces, about 11 or 12 jin each, were priced at 750 yuan. Medium pieces, slightly less than 4 jin, were priced at 350 yuan, equivalent to about 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per dan. Transactions were quite lively.</p>

<p>British officials claim that Anglo-Chinese trade is hampered by the undetermined exchange rate between China and Britain. According to financial authorities in Shanghai, there are actually very few major transactions in China's trade with Britain at present, and British domestic industry and commerce are also transitioning from wartime to peacetime. The amount of materials and equipment that can be supplied to China is extremely small. At the same time, the British authorities have set the U.S. dollar exchange rate within their sterling area at US$4.03 for every pound. Due to limited demand in the Shanghai market, the market price of the pound is constantly maintained between 3.6 yuan (the number of U.S. dollars converted from the pound). As for how to determine the exchange rate in order to promote the prosperity of trade between the two sides, it is hoped that the British authorities can have an enlightened way to set the exchange rate. However, it is said that the reason why our official exchange rate with Britain has not been determined is due to the above reasons, and there are no other opinions.</p>

<p>Glass yarn can be used as a substitute for rayon, and it was reported in this newspaper that foreign firms can order it. It is now learned that the Jianghai Customs recently announced that "According to the National Government's Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, the Jianghai Customs Import Management Office has listed nineteen kinds of luxury goods (including pure silk or mixed silk knitted satin, etc.). Except for those who apply to the Jianghai Customs Certification Office within ten days after the promulgation of these measures and can arrive before the 30th of this month, all are prohibited from being imported." Therefore, goods in transit, if they cannot arrive before the deadline, will definitely not be able to land. According to precedent, glass yarn cannot be imported either. Therefore, foreign firms are currently unable to accept orders.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Timber: Yesterday the timber trend was stable. The market was slightly better than before, because the weather was clear and the lumber yards moved slightly, so the sluggishness has slightly improved.</p>
<p>Tea: Dealers are selling old stocks of various grades, and the market is oversupplied, with prices trending lower and lower.</p>
<p>Sugar: The weather cleared up, customer sales gradually moved, and transactions were lively. Medium granulated sugar opened at 49,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 49,500 yuan, closing back at 49,250 yuan. Cotton white sugar was also boosted. Due to the large quantities of Qing sugar arriving in Xiamen and Shantou, it is temporarily difficult to expect it to improve. Dutch sugar is also in short supply, rising by 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: British-American cigarettes and Chinese factory cigarettes, Hangzhou and Ningbo procurement is quite strong, and with speculators participating in the activities, they are all thriving.</p>

<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch] The Qingdao Laiyang Road Aquarium is a famous Chinese aquatic specimen display institution. It can not only provide sightseeing and appreciation for the general public, but also provide reference for biologists. It is recently learned that since the aquarium was taken over by the Qingdao Observatory, it has actively reorganized its interior, collected specimens, and repaired fish ponds. It is expected to be officially opened to the public in mid-April.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Ministry of Justice and Administration Orders All Provinces and Cities to Vigorously Report Traitors in Education <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Dispatch] In order to vigorously report traitors in education, the Ministry of Justice and Administration has ordered all provinces and cities to comply, stating: Article 2, paragraph 1, item 5 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases stipulates that those who have served as presidents or held important positions in specialist schools or above affiliated with the puppet organization are traitors and should be vigorously reported. Therefore, there is no doubt about the punishment of puppet university presidents, independent college presidents, specialist school presidents, and those who hold important positions in these schools, such as deans, guidance counselors, and bursars, and deans of various colleges. According to item 8 of the same paragraph of the same article, heads of puppet cultural institutions who have presided over cultural organizations within the jurisdiction of the puppet organization and propagandized for the enemy and puppets are also traitors and should be punished. As for middle school principals, as heads of educational institutions, their importance is greater than that of civil officials, and according to the provisions of item 1 of the same paragraph of the same article, they should also be severely punished. Moreover, according to Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, "Those who have served in puppet organizations or their affiliated agencies and organizations, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, and engaging in actions that benefit the enemy and puppets or are detrimental to the country, shall be deemed to be plotting to resist the country." Middle school principals affiliated with puppet organizations should be important personnel serving in academic institutions affiliated with puppet organizations. In terms of their mission and behavior, it is sufficient to constitute a serious suspicion of relying on the labor of the enemy and puppets to engage in acts that benefit the enemy and puppets or are detrimental to the country. Local judicial organs should vigorously report and try them according to law.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch] After the victory, the provincial education office ordered the provincial schools originally located in the rear provinces to relocate in three phases.</p>
<p>The First and Second Phases Arrive in Wuhan to Resume School</p>
<p>The schools that should have relocated in the first and second phases have now arrived in Wuhan one after another. In addition to the Seventh Girls' High School, which has already started classes, the housing problems of the remaining schools have been gradually resolved. The Agricultural College is located in Baojie Temple, the Medical College is located in the former Yujie Middle School, Shizhong is located in Xijuanpeng, the Fourth Girls' High School is located in Beicheng Corner, the First Women's Normal School is located in Wulong Bridge, the Second Women's Normal School is located at the former Hilitazhi school site, and the First Girls' Vocational School is located in Duhuti. At present, the Medical College is still occupied by troops, and the remaining schools have begun repairs. If necessary, classes will be held while repairs are being carried out. All the necessary school supplies and desks for each school are ready, and they are actively preparing to resume classes. At the latest, they can all start classes one after another within next month, and each school can also recruit a portion of new students. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Provincial Government Has Difficulties and Decides on Three Measures</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The provincial government has many difficulties in resuming education. After several countermeasures, the provincial government decided on three measures: (1) The food expenses for public-funded students in middle schools and above in Wuhan can be temporarily increased by 4,000 yuan per student per month from March. After the central government approves the increase, it will be increased and deducted according to the approved amount. Regarding the 20% of public-funded students' food expenses in the two temporary middle schools and remedial classes, in addition to the 29 students covered by the balance of public-funded students approved by the central government, the food expenses for the remaining 70 students will be paid by the Finance Department from February of this year. (2) Emergency repairs and equipment, and relocation expenses will be paid from the 300 million yuan of educational and cultural restoration funds allocated by the central government. If the amount is insufficient, additional funds will be raised separately. (3) Troops stationed in schools and educational institutions are requested to be ordered by the Xingying to move out immediately, and it is reported that they are being implemented step by step.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Departing from the Mountainous Regions: Walking the Xilan Road in Snow <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bingzi, Xi'an Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 19th</p>
<p>The Xilan Highway, a vital artery of transportation in the Northwest, has made significant contributions to the nation and its people during the eight-plus years of the protracted war of resistance. Before the completion of the railways, it remains the only reliable means for developing and constructing the Northwest. I recently made a trip along the Xilan Road, and recorded my observations in a diary. While many entries are trivial, some are worth reporting.</p>
<p>Boarding a Sedan, Leaving Lanzhou</p>
<p>Although many travelers now opt for the Baotian Railway to travel from Lanzhou to Xi'an, some still prefer the Xilan Road. The train on the Baotian Railway is more economical, but traveling by car is faster and more direct. On the 9th, amidst falling snow, I departed from Lanzhou in a sedan, which was the second vehicle leaving Lanzhou for Shaanxi that week. Those who couldn't get sedan tickets traveled in trucks. Many of my fellow passengers were returning home or demobilized soldiers, some heading to Beijing and Shanghai, others to Beijing and Tianjin. Since the victory, there has been a massive exodus of demobilized personnel and people returning home from the northwestern provinces, especially Gansu and Xinjiang. The Northwest, which has always suffered from a lack of people and talent, now places no restrictions on those leaving. The responsible authorities should pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Arriving at Gancaodian, Snow Unmelted</p>
<p>The car arrived at Gancaodian around 10 AM. After breakfast, we continued our journey. The weather remained gloomy. On both sides of the highway, many farmers were already working in the fields. The heavy snow of a few days prior was greatly beneficial for sowing (spring wheat). Gansu suffered from severe drought last year, but a good harvest is expected this year. The car gradually climbed uphill past Dingxi. The accumulated snow remained unmelted along the way, turning the land white. Around 5 PM, we finally arrived at Huajialing, a dreaded stop for long-distance travelers. The entire journey covered 189 kilometers.</p>
<p>Huajialing is 2,700 meters above sea level, and travelers fear the unbearable cold. In the past, bandits were rampant near Huajialing, but now the presence of stationed troops has brought relative peace. The high mountains and steep ridges in this area are sparsely populated. The arduousness of the road construction work is beyond the imagination of those who travel by car. A stone monument stands outside the station to commemorate the heroic deeds of the engineers and laborers who died during construction.</p>
<p>Leaving Jiayuguan, Tears Still Wet</p>
<p>The prerequisite for developing the Northwest is to develop transportation. Highways alone are not enough; railway construction is imperative. We hope that all parties will show the same determination and spirit as when the highways were built, and construct the railways ahead of schedule. I remember that Wu Zhihui, before he passed away, told me after wandering through Hexi, "In the past, people said, 'Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes never dry from tears.' This is entirely due to the underdeveloped transportation. Outside Jiayuguan there is fertile land. If the railway is opened, people inside the pass will naturally move outside the pass. Even people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be willing to reclaim land outside the pass." Mr. Wu believed that without railways, everything would be in vain.</p>
<p>Snowing in June is Not a Myth</p>
<p>We stayed at the China Travel Service hostel in Huajialing. After getting up at 6 AM on the 10th, I found that the towel I used to wash my face last night had frozen into a block of ice. The stove in the room seemed useless. The cold was far more intense than when I passed through here from Chongqing around this time last year. Large snowflakes fell from the sky. Despite the driver's adage that "snow is easier to travel through than melting snow," he drove the car out. Ancient people said that "snowing in June is a rare sight," but here it is quite common. People from Jiangnan may consider it a myth.</p>
<p>Venturing Forward in Snow, Desolate and Uninhabited</p>
<p>We ventured forward in the biting cold and snow. Although it was downhill, we did not dare to rush. The journey was desolate and uninhabited. We occasionally passed a village or two, where we saw impoverished people dressed in rags. Gansu does not produce cotton. The clothing for the province's nearly seven million people mostly relies on external supplies. The provincial government has promoted local handicrafts, using wool to replace cotton to supplement the lack of clothing, but with limited success.</p>
<p>Around 1 PM, we arrived at Jingning County. This place is famous for its unique Northwestern "Guokui" (a kind of baked wheaten cake). The flour used to make "Guokui" is not only fine and white, but the water quality is also excellent. Those who are used to eating it say it tastes delicious. "Guokui" costs 80 yuan per kilogram, which is almost twice as cheap as in Lanzhou. Many travelers buy this local product as a gift for friends and relatives.</p>
<p>The Mist of Liupan Mountain Grows Thicker</p>
<p>After the snow stopped, we decided to abandon our plan to stay overnight in Jingning. As we left Jingning, we saw a vast plain. The left Gong Liu trees along the road stood tall. Gansu's policy of afforestation and forest protection over the years has achieved considerable results. After traveling more than twenty kilometers, we climbed the Liupan Mountain, which is even more treacherous than Huajialing. The silver world reappeared before our eyes, and the mist obscuring the road grew thicker as we ascended, like a morning in Chongqing. Liupan Mountain is said to be where Genghis Khan stationed his troops, but I have not yet verified this.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, we saw sprouting wheat fields and newly green willows, and the climate was noticeably different. At dusk, we arrived at Sanguankou. At the corner of the mountain is Liulangchao, an important place where Yang Liulang led troops to defend in the past. Residents near Sanguankou still tell stories of Yang Liulang's heroism. We reached Pingliang County when the city lights had already come on.</p>
<p>Pingliang is the only major town in eastern Gansu, with a population of ten thousand. Merchants from Gansu, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces gather here, and commerce is quite developed. Eastern Gansu is close to northern Shaanxi. In the past, due to the presence of the "Border Region," Pingliang was often on alert. Now that the full-scale military conflict has ceased, perhaps Pingliang can finally be at peace.</p>
<p>The Xilan Road is 719 kilometers long, and the entire journey is scheduled to take four days, with Pingliang as the central point. The 415-kilometer section of the Pingliang section is mostly mountainous, often giving travelers the feeling that "traveling is difficult." The 304-kilometer section of the Pingxi section has relatively flat roads, making the two-day journey feel quite pleasant.</p>
<p>Arriving at Jingchuan County, Greenery Everywhere</p>
<p>Leaving Pingliang on the morning of the 11th, we traveled 65 kilometers and arrived at Jingchuan for lunch. Jingchuan is the easternmost county in Gansu, and also a prosperous area. With the arrival of spring, the fields in Jingchuan are flourishing, and the land is green, reminiscent of the Jiangnan region. Not far from Jingchuan, we entered Shaanxi Province. We continued forward, passing through Changwu and arriving at Bin County in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I spent a night in Bin County, deeply impressed by the simplicity of the people. Because of timely rainfall, grain prices were particularly cheap. On the morning of the 12th, we departed from Bin County, passing through Yongshou, Qian County, Liquan, Xianyang, and other counties, and arrived at Xi'an. Near Qian County is the tomb of Wu Zetian, and Xianyang is the old base of the Qin Shi Huang. There are also many relics from the Han and Tang dynasties. Shaanxi has many historical sites and scenic spots that are worth admiring, but I have not yet had the opportunity to visit them. (March 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Scene on the Eve of Restoring Civil Administration: Hong Kong's Reality and Dreams <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong, Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd</p>
<p>Today, six months after Rear Admiral Harcourt (now promoted to Vice Admiral) led the British fleet back into Hong Kong, restoring civil administration has become a major concern for everyone. The restoration work in Hong Kong can be said to be on track, but when comparing the general social situation now and then, there is a sense of difference. This difference lies in the distinction between military administration and civil administration.</p>
<p>When Will Civil Administration Be Restored?</p>
<p>The people of Hong Kong seem to have the feeling that the existence of military administration is an obstacle to restoring the old order. Why hasn't military administration been abolished by now? In any case, military administration is a measure for extraordinary times. It does not seek adherence to established rules, but is skilled in expediency. The biggest thing is that, for the sake of temporary expediency, the government can disregard the interests and needs of the people, and use the two words "military administration" to silence the masses. Indeed, because military administration can concentrate power and act decisively, it naturally has many merits in the midst of reconstruction, as long as it is for the benefit of the people. However, in people's minds, these two words are associated with unpleasant things, and in the midst of peace and prosperity, they really don't want to see or hear them anymore.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities are aware of the psychology of the people and have been stepping up the restoration of civil administration. Some colonial administration experts have recently come to Hong Kong from London. "To facilitate future work, they often hire Chinese teachers in their spare time to learn the Cantonese language. Therefore, in addition to the documents that need to be handled, they often carry a Cantonese reader in their briefcases." Earlier this month, Hong Kong newspapers widely reported that civil administration would be restored on April 1st. The Hong Kong government has ordered former employees to report for duty. The selection of the Civil Governor is also under speculation.</p>
<p>Two Different Statements</p>
<p>Military Administrator General Harcourt, under the orders of Lieutenant General Summerall, returned to England on the 2nd of this month to discuss the Hong Kong issue with the Colonial Office. A week later, Major General Festing, Commander-in-Chief of the Hong Kong Army, told reporters: civil administration is expected to be restored in Hong Kong within three months. From General Festing's authoritative words, even if the restoration of civil administration is not as rumored on April 1st, it will not be later than June 1st.</p>
<p>Merchants are particularly welcoming to the restoration of civil administration. According to them: (1) They can recover pre-war debts owed by the Hong Kong government or private individuals; (2) They can withdraw frozen bank deposits; (3) They can more easily purchase foreign exchange; (4) They can freely buy and sell goods and stocks... There are also those who express worries. They believe that after the restoration of civil administration: (1) The government will no longer maintain the sale of subsidized rice; (2) The rich will be even more powerful and can do whatever they want; (3) Landlords can arbitrarily increase rents or evict tenants; (4) Prices will continue to rise... Whether they welcome it or worry about it, everyone still hopes that civil administration will be restored soon, and the restoration of civil administration is gradually being realized in people's hopes.</p>
<p>Subsidized Rice is Gone</p>
<p>Food is the most important thing for the people. Besides civil administration, another issue of concern to everyone is the supply of rice. Of the seven necessities of life, rice is the most important. However, in the past few months, subsidized rice at the price of one yuan for five catties has been attracting people from the mainland to Hong Kong in droves. Seeing the increasing consumption of rice and the decreasing source of rice, the Hong Kong government first reduced the allocation of rice per person per day from one catty to twelve taels. The result was ineffective. The second step was to allocate half white rice and half flour — rice rationing in Hong Kong is five times a day, twelve taels per day, a total of four catties each time, and half of it is two catties. It is said that the supply of flour is more abundant than rice, so it was reduced to two pounds each time. The value of each pound of flour is the same as the value of each catty of rice. Although the allocation has been changed several times, the price of two cents per catty has remained the same until now. On the 8th of this month, the third step was to simply stop issuing new rice purchase certificates.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities announced the reason for stopping the issuance of new rice purchase certificates: the source of rice in Hong Kong is based on the allocation of the Washington United Food Board, which is determined every three months according to the size of the Hong Kong population. Recently, due to the large influx of people from the mainland, the demand for rice exceeds the supply, and the Washington Food Board cannot increase the allocation of rice to Hong Kong in a timely manner. Therefore, Hong Kong must stop issuing new rice purchase certificates and warn people in mainland China: "There is no more subsidized rice in Hong Kong!"</p>
<p>Barely Filling the Stomach</p>
<p>According to Dr. Jiang Tingfu, the chief representative of our country to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Hong Kong's rice allocation for the first quarter of this year is 34,000 tons. This number, if calculated at 12 taels per person per day, can supply more than 800,000 people without lack. (Hong Kong currently imports only 700,000.) However, according to a Hong Kong government spokesman, the actual amount of rice received by Hong Kong is less than half of the original allocation. Hong Kong residents will have to live on one meal of rice and one meal of noodles a day. This diet may not be unpalatable to fellow countrymen in Shanghai, but Cantonese people are not used to eating noodles. Now they have to barely fill their stomachs! Otherwise, they will have to eat black market rice, which costs one yuan to one yuan and four cents per catty, equivalent to about 600 yuan in national currency. How can the general salaried class or the poor afford it?</p>
<p>If the problem of food is not properly resolved, other social problems will follow, and complications will arise. Today's Hong Kong, the wind of theft has not subsided, and labor disputes are rampant like a flood that has burst its banks... Disappointed, people intentionally or unintentionally pin their hopes on civil administration, thinking that once civil administration is restored, the business community can hope to prosper, and social problems can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Currently, the people of Hong Kong are indulging in their dream of the restoration of civil administration. (March 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Wuhan's Fear of Spring Chill <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhou Yaiying, Hankou Air Dispatch, 24th</p>
<p>Winter in Spring</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain and cold weather here, and one cannot feel a bit of warmth. Moreover, in these drizzly days, there was even hail that had not fallen last winter, reaching a coldness that had never been experienced last winter. This has delayed the time for the spring dresses of the wealthy ladies and misses to flaunt on the streets, which is not a big deal. It is only pitiful for those poor people who have no clothes and the refugees from the rear, who thought that winter would be immediately followed by spring. Who knew that spring could not break free from the shackles of "winter." As a result, a new picture of refugees has been added under the eaves of the three towns. Hunger, disease, and death not only disturb the poor people, but also alarm the wealthy and make them feel insecure.</p>
<p>Earlier, it seemed that spring had also quietly visited once. The withered willows in the suburbs sparsely sprouted new buds. Especially Zhongshan Park, which breathed in and out tens of thousands of "spring tourists" all day long. Who would have thought that the climate would change so abnormally? After the willow branches sprouted, they were destroyed again. The "gentlemen" sighed with sadness for spring, and the farmers frowned and worried about the spring harvest and spring plowing. Everyone thinks that this phenomenon of spring practicing winter orders is too untimely.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Wuhan still seems to have spring. A group of "national disaster tycoons" who have returned home in glory, and another group of "elders" and "new nobles" who have been promoted to meritorious officials, are living their illusory spring in the gentle land of extravagance and sensual pleasures, forgetting everything in reality. But in their spring, there is no hidden worry of severe winter? The other night, the patrol officers of the police station cracked a bizarre case in a "villa" of a dancing star, where several magnates and traitors were gambling. Eleven gamblers and pleasure seekers were all brought to justice together, which can be regarded as covering their spring love with a layer of winter scenery!</p>
<p>This "Eastern Chicago's" spring cold symbolizes people's depressed mood. The deformed prosperity of the market cannot conceal the inner uneasiness. As of now, almost no one has rebuilt houses from the ruins. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, holding a thought of expectation, and sometimes even realizing that the expectation will be destroyed by reality, just as the scenery of spring is revealed and then destroyed by the remaining power of the severe winter. There is no beautiful and bright spring light here. If there is, it can only be said to be "winter in spring."</p>
<p>Grain Prices and Commodity Prices Race</p>
<p>In the winter in spring, people are even more afraid of the grain prices and commodity prices that fuel the power of the spring cold. In Hubei, the amount of military grain to be purchased this year is 600,000 large packages, and the prisoner grain is 200,000 large packages. The price of military grain is 50 yuan per catty, while the market price has already reached 300 yuan. This huge difference can only come from the people. When the troops ask the local government for grain, the township and Bao personnel will naturally be justified, and there will be incidents of extorting and demanding bribes. According to the appeals of the people in Hanyang, the military grain allocated to the entire county has actually exceeded the quota by more than five times. Originally, it may be excusable to purchase military grain under the current circumstances, but such heavy exploitation has too much impact on people's food.</p>
<p>The central government's waiver of land tax is a great benevolent policy, but the lower-level governments have not deeply realized it. After the land tax was waived, the county and township agencies ran out of funds and had to apportion the funds for autonomy to the people. There is no definite limit to the amount of apportionment. Taking Wuchang County as an example, the military grain and autonomy fees to be paid by each household this month amount to 12,200 yuan. It is even more imaginable in other places.</p>
<p>Due to various reasons, Wuhan has not only attracted many righteous people, but also many "farmers" who have come to take refuge. The righteous people who returned home cannot go home, and the farmers who have homes also have to flee together. Especially in the Dabie Mountains, as a result of the military conflict, more than 70% of the rural areas within a thousand miles have been abandoned, and almost no farmhouses are left. How can they not rush to the city to make a living?</p>
<p>The urgent need for military grain and the surge in the urban population have been enough to make the grain prices in this area soar. In addition, Hunan and Hubei have suffered natural disasters and man-made disasters for years, the harvest is not abundant, and the cultivated area is very narrow, which has already led to widespread food shortages. In addition, transportation is difficult, and it is not easy to get outside assistance. Idle funds are rampant, and the trend of hoarding rice and national goods is becoming more and more intense. As a result, grain prices and commodity prices are competing to rise. A few days ago, a magistrate of Badong County committed suicide in Wuchang. The last words he left were: "I cannot bear to exploit the people, and I cannot afford to feed my family. I have to choose the path of suicide!" Indeed, grain prices and commodity prices are devouring people. The salaried class who keep themselves clean has suffered a more terrible misfortune than during the war.</p>
<p>"Commodity prices jump, everyone is noisy, the whistle blows, everyone laughs!" In public places, peddlers often sing such songs. Everyone seems to understand that the solution to the commodity problem is to increase production and to make transportation smooth, so they hope that the whistle of the ship will blow, the whistle of the train will blow, and the whistles of the factories will blow together. However, the railway line has not been smooth, the Yangtze River water level is still falling, and other industrial rehabilitation is also stagnant. It is still a distant dream to suppress commodity prices through production and transportation!</p>
<p>According to Chairman Wang, who returned from Chongqing, the central government has decided that the purchase price of military grain in each province will be calculated based on the average market price of several markets in the province, and will be determined once and will not be changed again. This is a fairly reasonable decision. If the local governments can follow it properly, then "the previously depressed low-pressure will have a chance to clear up.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Avaricious Officials and Treacherous Merchants are Like a Gust of Cold Wind, Chilling the Citizens <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>"Wuhan has two different kinds of people who create the same world. They only wish that the pain of others deepens, so they can obtain excessive happiness." A scholar, Mr. Gu Shi, an old professor, also expressed such a view when passing through here. Regardless of whether it was a complaint or a sigh, it is worthy of deep reflection. In recent days, corruption is like a gust of wind, and treacherous merchants are also like a gust of wind. These two gusts of wind blow into one world, causing most people to tremble under their lewd power.</p>
<p>According to Mo Heng, a special commissioner of the Executive Yuan, the enemy and puppet materials received amount to more than 2,000 kinds, with a value of more than 2,000,000,000,000 yuan. The government had long planned to sell them all to suppress local prices. However, the receiving agencies were stacked on top of each other, without clear authority. What should not have been received has already been received, and what was ordered to be received must be forced to be handed over. Even several large holes were found in the walls of the warehouse, and most of the materials disappeared. The demand for handover was sloppy, and the receiver refused to stamp the inventory. Receiving scandals of this kind are being played out in different ways. No one cares that the government's income should be immediately turned over to the national treasury, and the large quantities of materials expected by the people should be immediately moved into the market.</p>
<p>There are many people who have taken this opportunity to make a fortune in the recovered areas. Since they have millions in their pockets, they organize various enterprises and companies here in disguised ways to seek personal economic development. As a result, bureaucrats collude with big merchants, and merchants cling to influential officials, creating a "united front." In each larger company, the chairman of the board is mostly an important figure, and the manager is definitely a merchant. The manager shows his skills in business, and if something goes wrong, the chairman will take responsibility. These two types of people use each other to build their own happiness on the suffering of others, while the poor and impoverished common people are crushed to the point of suffocation.</p>
<p>When the reporter first arrived in Wuhan, the selling price of one shi of cooked rice was only 4,000 yuan, but now it has broken through the 40,000 yuan mark. A pack of matches used to cost only 10 yuan, but now it sells for 50 yuan. A catty of soybean oil used to cost only 180 yuan, but now it sells for more than 800 yuan. Previously, perhaps these reasons could be explained by the "law of supply and demand" from an economic perspective. But now, the problem does not conform to scientific principles in that way. As long as you can borrow capital, you can easily make a hundredfold profit. Whether you hoard or sell, the wartime regulations for controlling materials have been abolished, and you can manipulate them as you please. Because of this, although the monthly interest rate on high-interest loans here reaches four percent, the wealthy gods of wealth do not worry about not having a place to lend.</p>
<p>It seems that the work of strictly punishing corruption and purifying officialdom is also being carried out here. But apart from the county magistrates of Wufeng, Dangyang, and Yingshan counties, who are being sent to the court by the provincial government for investigation for corruption and dereliction of duty, other cases, such as Xiong Fei, a section chief of the Ministry of Transportation, who embezzled more than 50,000,000 yuan due to his initial use of power, and engaged in private fraud, was only sentenced to twelve years in prison. Ye Qianxiong, a section chief of the provincial government, sold public property worth tens of thousands of yuan, but still just left without a trace. When the various councils pursued the Ye case with the provincial authorities, the reply was: "Comrade Ye is a backbone cultivated by the state. Let you seniors continue to give him a way to reform himself!" Such corruption cases are being leniently let go so easily, which is truly inexplicable!</p>
<p>"Two kinds of people created the same world." Only the poor and impoverished common people are living through the winter of the South Pole and the celebration of the North Pole, and it is not easy for them to receive warmth.</p>
<p>Were the Scars Healed?</p>
<p>From an outward observation, after the recovery of the homeland, the brand-new national flags are constantly dazzling with light, fluttering in the wind, emitting some peaceful and warm feelings. Several bustling city streets also seem to have healed their scars and are gradually becoming prosperous. But this is only a signal of rebirth, and cannot be regarded as the essence of rebirth.</p>
<p>First, look at the city appearance. Japanese prisoners were used to clean up the ditches here, eliminating a lot of filth. In the middle of last month, in order to prepare for the inspection of a certain public figure, a large-scale cleaning inspection was also carried out, mobilizing 62,400 people, who swept away 1,938 tons of garbage in three days. This cannot but be regarded as a great achievement of the various bureaus of the municipal government. Unfortunately, time has passed and old habits have returned. Dangerous walls have not been repaired, street cleaners are rarely equipped, and sewage in the sewers and garbage on the streets still stink to the sky and pile up like hills. As for repairing roads and running public welfare undertakings, the municipal government's income is insufficient, and even the salaries of the staff are still in arrears of more than 33,400,000 yuan, making it even more powerless, and it can only allow them to remain incomplete.</p>
<p>"Spring is worrying!" According to the "prediction" published by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, after the war, there may be more than 100 kinds of epidemics in Wuhan. Each kind of patient may number in the hundreds of thousands. Although this terrible prediction has not yet become a reality, according to the report of the Municipal Health Bureau, smallpox, diphtheria, and encephalitis have spread in the poor people's residential areas. In response to this fact, effective prevention should be carried out. However, Wuhan's sanitary facilities are not even up to the most basic conditions. In addition to the original private hospitals and the health teams of the Rear Service Department and the Executive Yuan, there is only one provincial and one municipal hospital, with a total of only 340 beds. Therefore, the call for epidemic prevention is as tiring as the spring cicada, and all relevant parties have only made a few leaflets for epidemic prevention. In addition, such as injecting vaccines, setting up inspection stations, and opening isolation hospitals, are all still at a loss.</p>
<p>Another problem currently facing us is unemployment relief and industrial recovery. According to relatively accurate statistics from the provincial and municipal authorities, the number of unemployed people in Wuhan is more than 115,000, one-third of whom are skilled workers. The Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated 20,000,000 yuan to the Workers' Welfare Society to handle relief, half of which is used as small loans, and half of which is used to purchase tricycles and rent them to workers to drive in Wuchang. But this is a drop in the bucket, and it is feared that it will be difficult to provide relief. On the other hand, the remaining enemy and puppet industrial units originally numbered more than 300, but now only 84 units are under the custody of the Hubei Provincial Government. Among them, 29 units have been rectified and resumed work, and merged into eight factories for machinery, alcohol, oil refining, bricks and tiles, brewing, textiles, matches, and papermaking. The total number of workers in the eight factories is only more than 1,500, which is really pitiful. Although there are another dozen or so inland factories that are forming a joint association to prepare to resume work in Wuhan, there are many difficulties, and it is not known when the sound of looms can be heard. On the one hand, manpower is wasted, and on the other hand, industry is stagnant. How can people not be extremely melancholy?</p>
<p>Equally serious as the unemployment problem is the problem of out-of-school children and youths. At present, the Ministry of Education has planned to allocate funds to hold ten temporary university preparatory classes and ten remedial classes here. The provincial government has set up two temporary middle schools in Wuchang and Hanyang, and five provincial capital elementary schools. The Han Municipal Government has also run one middle school for boys and one for girls, and seventeen Hui elementary schools. Adding in the original private schools, it can be considered quite impressive. However, the number of out-of-school people in Wuhan has exceeded 80,000, and the capacity of existing schools is far from meeting the needs. Moreover, there is a serious housing shortage, and there is no place for school buildings. The preparatory classes and remedial classes planned by the Ministry of Education are still indefinitely delayed in starting. Even the Municipal Fourteenth Elementary School, which already has school buildings, caused elementary school students to petition and cry because the landlord took it back for his own use. Under these circumstances, the children who get the opportunity to study are only a small number of playboy children introduced by dignitaries. Their elegant figures often appear in dance halls, and even create a new situation with strange talks of holding school affairs meetings in dance halls! Such bad school practices should be corrected.</p>
<p>The reporter finally wants to say: In the rebirth of Wuhan, there is indeed anemia and corrosive bacteria. I believe that the spring scene with winter intentions will definitely become a thing of the past. Then, in the next dispatch, I will try to report some bright aspects! (March 24)</p>

<h3 id="e97">The True Face of "Democratic" Politics in the "Liberated Area" of Northern Jiangsu Today <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>"Northern Jiangsu" and "Southern Jiangsu" are only separated by a river. Today's Southern Jiangsu is becoming more and more stable and prosperous. Especially those who live in big cities, their ears, eyes, mouths, and noses are steamed by songs, dances, wine, and food, and they have gradually forgotten the atmosphere of gunpowder for eight years. But in Northern Jiangsu, separated by a river, even today, nearly a year after the victory, nine-tenths of the people are still living a life of suffering, struggling and weeping. And it is not known when this kind of life, where one cannot live nor die, will end!</p>
<p>The author, during the Lunar New Year, used the excuse of going out to pay New Year visits, and after countless efforts and suffering that is difficult to express, only recently arrived in the "paradise" of Southern Jiangsu. Recalling the situation in my hometown, it is as if it is another world. And the current situation of the "liberated area" in Northern Jiangsu, which seems like another world, may be unimaginable to non-outsiders.</p>
<p>In the "liberated area," the "political instructor" is the highest authority in each small area. And all the measures of the "political instructor" are completely based on the orders of the "Party." Their armed forces—the so-called "people's armed forces"—are absolutely their "tools" for all their actions. In addition to their regular army, they have widely organized "militia teams" to serve as their military pawns. Any military action is to have the militia go to the front, and the regular forces closely follow the militia with machine guns. If the militia retreat in the face of battle, there is also an "unglorious" dead end behind them. Therefore, every time they want to complete their "mission," the death and injury of thousands of militiamen is not considered anything. If the side being attacked cannot bear to harm these innocent civilians and retreat somewhat, they have fallen for their "bitter trick." If they really fight back, they will have more material for propaganda. The more able-bodied civilians die in the "liberated area," the more desolate agriculture and industry become. The surviving people also have to be busy with constantly launching "comfort," "donations," from grain and firewood to clothing, shoes, and socks, and even young women and children, nothing is not included.</p>
<p>At the same time, the authorities in the "liberated area" are most jealous of intellectuals and people who have some prestige in the local area. Because this is the biggest "obstacle" to their work. Obstacles must be eliminated! In order to realize the spirit of "democracy," first add the names of "stubborn," "local tyrant," and "Trotskyite" to the people who are to be dealt with. Then, convene a people's congress to "publicly try" them. When holding the people's congress, all men, women, old, and young in the entire area must participate. Whoever does not participate is "resisting orders," which is unbearable. At the meeting, the instructors guide in groups, first calling the person being publicly tried to go on stage to "confess." If what is said does not meet their expectations, it is "not confessing" and must be said again. If the confession is still not up to par, then the "people's representatives" who are squeezed next to the instructors will come out to refute. After one refutation, the instructor immediately puts it to a "vote." Who dares to touch the tiger's whiskers in the face of the instructor's words! In this way, the obstructive elements are eliminated in accordance with the people's public opinion, and the spirit of "democracy" is thus fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>Now all regions have "elected" administrative personnel and established "people's" administrative institutions. The methods are all the same. In these years of suffering, the common people only hope that no one will make trouble for them, and that they can eat tree bark and grass roots in peace, without making other extravagant hopes. Helplessly, even this tiny hope, which could not be smaller, has not been given to them! They dare not seek even half a trouble with the military and political authorities again. Of course, they can only obey any orders and instructions.</p>
<p>The people in this area do not have a relatively complete residence. The more tidy houses have all been torn down cleanly. Even the dogs that guard livestock and food in farmhouses have been killed, leaving not a single one. A dog, born as a dog, certainly does not know what crime it has committed! Before the victory, they did this, saying it was to avoid the activities of the Japanese invaders. After the victory, there are still many houses, even the ruined walls that have been demolished, that continue to be demolished, saying that the remnants of the "bourgeoisie" must be wiped out before it is good. Landowners with a bit of land, under the auspices of the "Farmers' Resistance Association," launch a movement called "overturning rent," coaxing the grain households to withdraw the rent that was previously collected according to daily compound interest. If they cannot withdraw the money and grain, they will take out the land to calculate. Because the grain households only have the obligation to withdraw rent and pay "public grain," and collecting rent is out of the question. They also need merchants to absorb grain seeds and materials needed outside the "liberated area," but the price paid is "resistance currency," which is forty or fifty times more than the legal currency. As for the legal currency there, it is as unusable as the "Central Reserve Bank Notes" of the past, even worse than counterfeit money! Newspapers and magazines printed outside the "liberated area" are all on the list of prohibited items. One of the author's relatives, inadvertently, when returning from Taizhou, was found to have a newspaper that was used to wrap shoes, which was a Shen Bao from four months ago, and it caused a very, very big trouble! There is no freedom to read newspapers and books, and there is even less talk of freedom of speech. The post offices in many places have been forcibly taken over by the "Transportation Bureau," expelling all the original employees and appointing others to handle them. The stamps have also been replaced with a kind printed with a portrait of Mao Zedong. It is certainly extremely difficult for the people to communicate with the outside non-"liberated area," and even in-area communication is subject to strict inspection. If it is discovered that the people have communicated with those related to the central government, they will be regarded as traitors, and there is an immediate danger of losing their family and life! Although victory is nearly a year away, those who have served in the government or army, or have engaged in resistance and construction work in the rear, are still not allowed to return to their homes. Their family members who have fallen into this area are called "stubborn relatives." Tearing down houses naturally starts with the houses of "stubborn relatives," and the men, women, old, and young of "stubborn relatives" are permanently severely discriminated against, and even sighing is impossible! As for the officials sent by the central government to take office after the victory, there are many who have lost their lives in inexplicable ways. The county magistrate and administrative commissioner of Huaiyin County are recent examples. However, traitors who once participated in pseudo-organizations and truly cooperated with the enemy are not on the list of those who are paying attention; perhaps because these people can make money, they are very close to them in doing business. Although their superiors may not be fully aware of this kind of business.</p>
<p>Most of the people living in the "paradise" do not pay much attention to this barren area of Northern Jiangsu. However, the CCP regards it as a very good "granary," and even a lot of food outside this area is taken from here. This vast plain is indeed a "land of fish and rice." Even the items needed in the cities of Southern Jiangsu, such as cotton, beans, wheat, sorghum, as well as pigs, cattle, geese, and ducks, are 60% supplied by Northern Jiangsu. Only because the transportation here is inconvenient and it is not easy to attract outsiders to investigate, the outside world is not very clear about the actual situation, so it is inevitable to ignore it. And those who have ulterior motives in here are just taking advantage of this opportunity that the central government and the public do not pay much attention to, and they can do whatever they want, creating the current situation! When the news of victory first spread to Northern Jiangsu, everyone was so excited, thinking that they could escape from the water and fire and ascend to the comfort of mats; who knew that until now, the situation is still so bad; the comfort of mats is not known where it is, and the pain of the situation is as deep as water and as burning as fire!</p>
<p>The author recently received a message from home, relayed many times, that my family has also been labeled as "stubborn relatives!" At present, they are demanding that my "stubborn relatives" hand me over within a limited time! I dare not go back, nor do I want to go back to die. Although I know that wandering to Southern Jiangsu, there is no place for me to live in the "paradise," but to be a stray duckweed in the "paradise," the spirit is still much more cheerful. (Huaisheng, February 24)</p>

<p>On trains and in hotels, meals are limited to a fixed amount of rice exchanged for a food allowance. It has become common knowledge that if you go to a friend's or relative's house for a meal, you must also take out a corresponding amount of rice in exchange, and there is no need to be polite. For us foreigners residing here, originally, if we wanted to leave the county where we lived, we had to report to the police station and apply for a permit. Later, even if we wanted to leave the city or town where we lived, we were subject to this restriction.</p>

<p>— Chen Gange</p>
<p>Education is a kind of life experience, using words to convey it to later generations. No matter what, education in China today goes through a translation process. Training such talents, as it is currently, requires a long period of training to become an average individual of knowledge, let alone talking about technology. How can we achieve any educational development? Because of this, some have suggested the Latinization of Chinese, using Roman letters to string together the language of our country. This seems like it can simplify our writing, but in fact, Chinese characters have been the sole sharp tool for expressing Chinese culture for thousands of years. How can they be abolished overnight? However, the space Chinese characters occupy is a large benign tumor in cultural progress. In this rapidly changing era, those who care about education should always worry about our benign tumor!</p>
<p>But, some might ask: Who told you to be born in China in this era? Since you cannot personally witness all kinds of facts happening, then you have to recognize them one by one from Chinese characters!</p>
<p>That's right. In fact, everyone cannot personally see every event and must go through the translation of words to increase some knowledge. No wonder a diligent middle school student must hold onto books, complete ten math problems, then turn to history, read geography, look up at the clock, and it is already midnight. And the homework to be read (prepared) is still such a pile. Middle school students, after ten years of studying, cannot even talk about research, only reading, reading, reading for ten years. Time binds them very strictly, so even research cannot be talked about. From this, we can infer: Is it possible that China really does not have talents? The reason that Chinese education does not talk about technology and is not research-oriented is definitely not a shortcoming of the writing system, we can say with certainty.</p>
<p>Chinese education is not hindered by the writing system, but by the educational period being stretched out too long. Imagine, from reading cow, sheep, grass, and flowers to understanding the explanation of zhi hu ye zai, it also takes so much time. — Actually, the true Chinese class is only five hours each week. The rest, such as arithmetic, history, geography, nature, art, …… so much that they forget the cow, earth, grass, and flowers they just taught. This says: Is the word cow difficult? I say: New is more difficult!</p>
<p>For example, history. The teacher holds the book and reads out the establishment of the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu, and asks: "Do you all understand?" Students must study hard for several hours at home before they can understand the situation of the three-way division. If the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu were put on the silver screen, they would not only know immediately, but even be able to shout out which one is right and which one is wrong.</p>
<p>For example, geography. Rising coasts and sinking coasts, local customs. If they were moved to the silver screen, students would no longer find geography boring.</p>
<p>Some would ask back: It's easy to say. Don't you know that China is poor? There is no money, and schools cannot build movie theaters. Do you know that?</p>
<p>How could I not know? At the same time, I also know that many schools can be converted or have existing grounds, but they definitely would not do so, and filmmakers would not put rising and sinking coasts into the camera, because it would not make money to show them to students and have them researched. What's more, entertainment donations are the income of the Finance Bureau, and education funding is the expenditure of the Education Bureau!</p>
<p>But we have to shout loudly:</p>
<p>"Simplify education!"</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Difficulties of Children's Theatre Movement <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Tang Shaohua's call for building a "Children's Theatre" evokes deep emotions.</p>
<p>The construction of a "Children's Theatre" is urgently needed; but before construction, promoting children's groups, developing children's plays, and gaining sympathy and importance for children's theatre should be necessities to strive for and achieve!</p>
<p>Our "Jian Jian Theatre Company" was established in the spring of 1940 under such a premise. During the occupation, to avoid "registration" and the attention of the enemy and puppets, we used names like "Shanghai Shanghai Opera Company Jian Jian Group" and performed eight times.</p>
<p>After the victory, we also performed twice at "Russia,"</p>
<p>But what was the result?</p>
<p>The social response was not very great, but the energy expended was extremely large.</p>
<p>This is a difficult and thankless task.</p>
<p>Now, I want to share some difficulties learned from experience, hoping that like Mr. Tang, drama workers with a "child's heart" will work together to overcome them.</p>
<p>1. Shortage of Scripts: The entire theatre circle is complaining, but children's scripts can be said to be a "desert." The two multi-act plays and more than ten one-act plays we performed were all written by ourselves.</p>
<p>2. Shortage of Directors: Professional directors are indeed unaffordable for "children." Even directors with some research and achievement cannot be invited due to being busy or other reasons. Our directors are either ourselves or other amateur enthusiasts.</p>
<p>3. Shortage of Time: The actors in children's plays are mostly students from elementary and middle schools, but the class times of Shanghai's elementary and middle schools are not uniform. If you want to rehearse after 4 o'clock, some schools have classes until 6 o'clock; on Sundays, some schools also have classes. So we have to rehearse at night, but elementary school students have to be escorted home after 9 o'clock, which doubles the personnel effort. Sometimes, the non-uniform "small exams" of various schools prevent rehearsals.</p>
<p>4. Children are prone to colds, which is very common among most malnourished Shanghai children. We often encounter situations during rehearsals where someone has a cold or a headache, and we have to stop temporarily. Once, during a performance at "Xuan Gong," a child suddenly fell ill, causing chaos.</p>
<p>5. Financial Strain: In the summer of 1940, we performed at the "Ningbo Association," and the tickets were only sold for thirty and fifty cents, which was enough to cover expenses. But after the victory, it was different. Last October, we performed three shows at the "Russian Art Theatre" and lost more than four million puppet currency. It was all paid for by the few teachers among us deducting their salaries. Later, we rehearsed "Love Education" and planned to perform it on New Year's Day. After inquiring about the prices of theatres, scenery, lighting, etc., they had increased by an average of fifteen times. How could we afford it? We had to "blow" the rehearsed play.</p>
<p>6. Society Disregards Children: This is our old Chinese tradition, thinking that children are always not very good; although those who have seen our plays say they are acceptable, and some even say "not easy." But if the ticket price is the same as ordinary amateur theatre companies, it will inevitably be "laughed at." The ticket price has to be lowered, but the expenses are the same as other theatre groups. Sometimes, we even encounter "They're performing kids' plays, let's rip them off." How can we afford this?</p>
<p>7. Most Teachers Do Not Understand the Importance of Drama Education: Our target audience is primarily students. However, most teachers do not give us sympathy and help. They think that acting is just "playing around," and even some stubborn people in some schools forbid children from joining the drama club.</p>
<p>The above are the actual difficulties we have encountered in the work of the children's theatre movement over the past seven years. To rescue children from lewd entertainment and promote genuine children's drama education, we must overcome these difficulties before building a "Children's Theatre," and we must overcome them immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Film and Drama Groups with the "China" Signboard <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Ledao</p>
<p>In the rear, most of the film and drama groups were government-run, so their names usually started with "Central," "China," or "Chinese." Even those that were privately run also started with the word "China," all with the "China" signboard. Since the victory, these "China"-headed film and drama groups have come east one after another. Some rely on the "China" signboard to take over, and some want to use it to compete for territory. Because there are so many "China"s, outsiders may inevitably be confused. Now, I will list them all to see how many "China" signboards there are.</p>
<p>"China Electric": This is the abbreviation of the Central Film Studio, directly under the Central Propaganda Department. It was originally located in Nanjing and moved west to the South Bank of Chongqing after the Anti-Japanese War. The original studio in Nanjing was destroyed during the war and was later rebuilt into many bungalows by the enemy and puppets. The "China Film" factories in Shanghai that were taken over this time and assigned to "China Electric" included the Cultural News Film Studio in Zhabei, the Guohua Factory after being bought by "China Film," the "China Film" production department on Haig Road, and the "China Film" office on the third floor of the Hamilton Mansion.</p>
<p>"China Film": This is the China Film Studio, directly under the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission. Its predecessor was the Film Section of the Political Training Office of the Hankou Headquarters. It was established in Wuhan in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War and moved to Chongqing to build a factory before the fall of Wuhan. This time, it took over the "Yi Hua" factory and the "Lian Hua" factory in the triangle area of Xujiahui, and its management and distribution departments were also located on the third floor of the Hamilton Mansion.</p>
<p>"China Education": This is the China Education Film Studio, directly under the Ministry of Education. It specializes in shooting 16mm silent films. It was established in the autumn of 1942, and its factory was located in Beibei Hot Spring, Chongqing. Because it was newly established, the outside world had a relatively shallow impression of it. During this victory takeover, it did not get anything. The Central Propaganda Department is now planning to allocate the old site of "China Electric" in Nanjing to "China Education," which can also be said to be "equal distribution."</p>
<p>In addition to the above film production organizations, there are also drama groups:</p>
<p>"China Wansui": This is the abbreviation of the China Wansui Drama Troupe, which is affiliated to "China Film," and its staff are also from "China Film." In recent years, it has performed very little in Chongqing. Recently, it plans to reorganize in Shanghai and regroup.</p>
<p>"China Electric Drama Troupe": This was originally an amateur organization affiliated to "China Electric." Because it could not shoot films in the rear, performing plays could also support the facade. After moving from Chongqing to Shanghai, it could not find a performance venue for a while, which was quite troublesome. Recently, it started performing "Wan Shi Shi Biao" at the Lyceum Theatre. In terms of organization, it will appear in a self-sufficient manner and gradually become independent from "China Electric."</p>
<p>"China Art": The China Art Theatre Company, organized by Zhao Zhiyou, Jin Shan, etc., collapsed due to internal economic collapse before the victory.</p>
<p>"Chinese Art": The Chinese Drama Art Society, hosted by Ying Yunwei, struggled in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places for several years and is still in the mainland.</p>
<p>"China Youth": The Central Youth Drama Society of the Three People's Principles Youth League, also a government-run example, was successively headed by Ma Yan and Zhang Junxiang. In the past year or two, it seems to be in a state of stagnation due to lack of leadership.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also "Roar," "Amateur," and several other "established in name only" and "fleeting" groups in Chongqing. Because they did not use the "China" signboard, there is no need to elaborate.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Listed in the Annals of History <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Lang Huan</p>
<p>"Listed in the Annals of History" is a colorful war film produced by MGM, directed by Simon. It is also a film made by Huarez Pires to commemorate his 30 years in the film industry and dedicated to the US Navy. Huarez Pires' acting skills have long been praised by the audience, but in this film, we can see that he is going all out. This method of commemoration is indeed very meaningful because this effort adds a brilliant page to the glorious history of Huarez and Lai.</p>
<p>In this film, Huarez Pires plays a sergeant major who retired after serving for 30 years. Because the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, which evolved into the invasion of the Philippines, he rose up and recruited volunteers to form a militia to defend his motherland. Although this group of passionate men inflicted fatal blows on the Japanese invaders, they eventually died heroically due to the disparity in strength.</p>
<p>The flesh and blood of the martyrs could not withstand the enemy's artillery fire, but their impassioned spirit had shattered the Japanese invaders' dreams. They not only shocked the invaders' courage, but also awakened a group of people who defended their motherland, laying the foundation for the fate of restoring their homeland.</p>
<p>Huarez Pires' generous personality is indeed very suitable for the role he plays in this film. His impassioned actions can grasp the plot of each scene very well. The war scenes are very realistic, and it is said that they were filmed in cooperation with the US Navy.</p>
<p>In the tragic story, there are also some stories of young lovers. The good thing is that these do not loosen the theme but add to the interest of life. Faber Indes plays the sergeant major's wife, and her expression is very delicate. In addition, Le Jinler Owen, who plays the Nazi, Marilyn McSwire, who plays the sergeant major's daughter, and Rego Lins, who plays the sergeant major's subordinate, are all very competent.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Ray Milland's Success <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>Ray Milland is now thirty-eight years old. He has been married for fourteen years. His wife's name is Manly White, a lady with silver hair and purple-blue eyes. They already have a child, a five-year-old boy named Danery, and the family is harmonious.</p>
<p>The above is the latest family situation of Hollywood's number one star today; the winner of the 1945 "Oscar" statue. Before Ray entered Hollywood, he studied at the Royal Academy of Cambridge. Later, he also studied mechanical engineering at Wales University for a year. But he felt lonely, without dancing, riding, or outdoor throwing, so he moved from stillness and said the hope of "66 system" is that six years should be responsible for seeking knowledge, and six years should be active outward and work outward. So Ray left school at the age of twenty-one to play in Paris. From these points, it can be thought that Ray is a thorough mover. In that year, he met an English actress and wanted to devote himself to the stage, but was rejected by this actress. Later, through Miss White Ruby's introduction, Ray finally achieved his ambition and went to Hollywood. And Hollywood also recognized this talented star. However, Hollywood stars are not all rising to the sky in one fell swoop. They succeed only after long-term efforts and development. Ray Milland is no exception.</p>
<p>You see, in "Ambassador Bill" and "Were Not Dressing," wasn't only a very unimportant supporting role given to him? It wasn't until he co-starred with Claudette Colbert in "The Gilded Lily" and with Dorothy Lamour in "Jungle Princess" that he gradually emerged. He only began to be noticed in "Beau Geste" and "The Major and the Minor." It wasn't until he starred in "The Lost Weekend" that he was unanimously praised and admired for his acting skills. In this film, he plays a drunkard, performing vividly and vividly. And from then on, he laid his foundation and future. So now Paramount is relying on him very much. This year, he has four films starring him. One, co-starring with Pauline Goddard in the costume love epic "The Trouble with Women," Three, co-starring with Theresa Wright in "The Imperfect Lady," Four, co-starring with Barbara Stanwyck in the martial arts five-color film "California." Shanghai movie fans should wait for the arrival of each film in Shanghai and wait and see!</p>

<p>Shi Buwei asks: I recently read a magazine and learned that a German doctor invented a method of treating pulmonary tuberculosis and laryngeal tuberculosis by planting cutaneous tuberculosis, which has been effective in thousands of people. However, if cutaneous tuberculosis gradually heals, the original tuberculosis recurs. I think that perhaps due to the war, this method cannot be popular in the world. Please explain the principle for the research of the medical community.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin disease caused by tubercle bacillus. If tubercle bacillus is artificially planted on the skin, the body can produce a special antitoxin. If this person also suffers from pulmonary tuberculosis, the antitoxin produced by cutaneous tuberculosis can also inhibit the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis. Its efficacy is still difficult to say.</p>

<p>Visiting Brother Chu Youxiang: After eight years of separation, I miss you very much. I am still staying in Guizhou. Please send the letter to Wang Tian of the First Battalion, 614th Regiment, 205th Division of the Guizhou Youth Army. If any relatives or friends know his whereabouts, please inform them for me. (Chu Jinxiang)</p>
<p>Visiting Brother Zhang Zuoju: A native of Chaoyang County, he served in the Sixth Grain and Clothing Warehouse of the Seventh War Zone Military Station Headquarters in Lechang County, Guangdong in the spring of 1944. Since July of the same year, there has been no news. The whole family is extremely anxious. Gentlemen of benevolence, if you know his whereabouts, please send the letter to No. 78 Sichuan South Road, Shanghai. I am very grateful. (Zhang Ke)</p>
<p>Visiting Third Uncle Wu Zhiying: His courtesy name is Xingkai. He originally worked at Zhengji Hardware Store. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, he was determined to join the army. He withdrew west with the national army. There has been no news for eight years. His family eagerly hopes that he will return home and enjoy family happiness. Why has there been no news in May? If anyone knows the whereabouts of his uncle, please send the letter to No. 9 Bei Lane, South Chengdu Road. (Wu Qifu)</p>
<p>Visiting Tian Zhaoxiang: He is forty-four years old, of medium build, speaks with a Jingjiang accent. In January 1943, he was deceived by the enemy and puppets and recruited to work on Waibaidu Bridge. Since then, there has been no news. It is expected that he was transported to other places to work. The whole family is heartbroken. After the victory, the deceived coolies returned one after another. Please publish an advertisement to find him. I am very grateful.
