<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕政府爲公開政治協商會議內容，俾國內外人民明瞭起見，在該會議開幕期間，將准許新聞記者旁聽，惟名額以不超過全體會員總數卅八人爲限，並悉，參加旁聽之外籍記者，將有十五人。又政治協商會議秘書長一職，已發表由雷震氏担任，秘書處六日正式成立，該處工作人員已由國民參政會秘書處及該會憲政實施協進會，經濟建設策進會調用。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾張羣周恩來　今日舉行首次會　將擬定停止衝突恢復交通具體辦法　協商代表同時討論議程</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日午夜廣播稱：國民政府與共黨之談判，已有顯著之進步，七日將有兩項具體之會議在重慶舉行。（一）馬歇爾。張羣與周恩來三人委會，舉行首次會議，由馬歇爾任主席，擬定關於停止衝突及恢復交通之具體辦法。（二）協商會代表三十八人，舉行首次非正式會談，討論一月十日展幕之第一次大會之議程及投票方法等問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕美新聞處訊：馬歇爾特使，五日上午十一時三十分往謁蔣主席，並同進午餐。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶六日電〕共黨代表周恩來宣稱：國共代表昨日商定之停止衝突命令，將在政治協商會議開幕前三日內發出。據民主同盟發言人羅隆基稱：停止衝突命令之草案，正由雙方加以考慮，並將提交馬歇爾將軍。此項命令不適用於東九省，因東九省非國共衝突區域之故。此項草案中不列入東九省，暗示共黨已承認由國軍接收東北，或爲雙方交換條件之一部，但未發表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕共產黨代表周恩來與政府代表四川省主席張羣初次會晤以後，即表示樂觀。渠謂，中央政府已完全同意共產黨所作恢復一切交通（包括鐵路郵電航空）計劃，衆信政治協商會議將能增加壓力，使爭執雙方獲一切實協定。關於實際停止衝突之日期尚未確定，共黨方面謂，國共不久將發表共同公報。若十消息靈通人士指稱：衝突縱能立即停止，非必能保證基本問題之最後解決，但今日各界人士咸信，談判將達最高階段。馬特使刻仍研究中國內部問題各方面情形，對談判之進行，顯然持愼重態度。前傳馬特使將赴延安一行，但據馬特使屬員稱，在團結談判未獲協定或朱曾破裂以前，不致成行。又吳鐵城星期日設宴招待參政會全體代表，共產黨定星期一午後舉行鷄尾酒會招待各界，已發出請帖四百份，馬歇爾將軍亦在被邀之列。</p>
<p>內蒙宣慰團將分組出發</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日鴛〕今後成爲中國正式北牆的內蒙，正在複雜的因素下，動盪不安，白雲梯所領導的內蒙宣慰團，目下正在這裏待機起飛，他們將分爲數組，分別出發東北和熱河·察哈爾·綏遠·白雲梯本人參加那一組，還沒有一定，德王也在北平過冬，他對於內蒙是頗有一點消極的影響的，內蒙新的動盪消息，來自東北興安一帶，那裏已有一個「人民委員會」存在，現有自僞軍改編之武力兩萬，還在繼續招兵買馬，這個「人民委員會」的委員長是包寶臣，秘書長爲馬鳴周，另外一個重要人物是內蒙人民革命黨領袖童希文。據最近的消息稱：察綏共產軍最近也消極起來了，將張家口大批的東西每天西運，而相反倒是此間官方對察綏的局勢，却一天天樂觀了。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕美國務院今日聲稱：中國及蘇聯政府關於外蒙古地位所獲之任何決議，美國將予接受，重慶官方宣佈，中國根據中蘇條約承認外蒙古獨立，此爲史達林元帥·蘇外委畏莫洛托夫及蔣經國三人在莫斯科迭次會商以後所決定者。</p>
<h3>粵稅收日增　沿海鹽場恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州六日電〕粤海關經復員調整，稅收已日見激增，現每日可達一千萬元。復員後兩月來共收六萬萬元以上。南洋方面通匯後，每月華僑匯兌款額，約達三四十萬萬元。此予各地民生經濟，影響極大。同時滬粤問近以交通漸趨頻繁，故兩地匯兌亦日見增加，其中尤以電匯居多，匯費已由百分之十二減低至百分之八。一般市况，較前活躍，惟以物資較缺，因此價格仍在繼續上漲中，而銀根亦較前緊絀。粤省沿海各鹽塲，其中有若干地處，因戰事關係，損失一空，經由鹽務機關決定，貸款救濟，俾得繼續生產，待收成後，以貨攤還，現各地鹽塲均已先後恢復。據當局聲稱：目前沿海各鹽塲產量甚鹽，除足供內地民食外，尚可以三分之一餘量，運往國外。</p>
<h3>孫連仲長官談話</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日鴛〕孫畏官連仲今單獨接見本報記者，據談：（一）冀省曾仍將設保定，目前省府在平，係遷就現實。（二）戰區內之河北部份，僅有石家莊及滄縣日軍二萬人，尚未繳械；至已繳械回國者，約計二萬九千餘人，速同日僑已遣散者計十四萬餘人，至尚未遣送回國之日僑，擬予以再敎育，俾根除其侵略思想，在其心理中遍撒和平種子。目前已就此事與美國心理作戰部代表商洽中。（三）冀省國大代表及參議會正籌選中，據記者探悉冀省國大代表原定五十名，現已改爲區域代表佔百分之六十，職業代表佔百分之四十，按以前定爲區域代表四十三人及職業代表七人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕中國駐美大使魏道明即將返國述職，今日曾會見國務卿貝爾納斯，但魏氏及國務院對於所談何事，皆不表示意見。據未證實消息：魏氏係向貝爾納斯探詢最近莫斯科三國外長會議討論中國局勢至於何種程度，並欲知美國對於中國局勢最近所抱態度及在國共談判中所希望於國民政府者如何。</p>
<h3>視察天津青島公畢宋院長今日飛滬</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕平津工業將要在新歲中獲得新生。平津區經過宋院長的鐵腕淸理後，已經有一百六十三個工廠改由經濟部重新接收，對於復工間題，宋院長採取的是立刻個別解決，決不攪在一起拖泥帶水，因爲工廠大半在天津，所以他把所有有關各特部派員一古腦兒帶到天津去共同解決。平津區敵僞產業處理局的督導委員會，內分礦業，冶鍊，機械，電工，造紙，藥業，紡織，酸鹼等組，最近也要分組出發，揭開各廠的封條，實際考察復工問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津六日電〕宋院長偕隨員等一行，六日上午九時四十分乘中航專機離津飛靑島，預定停留一日，七日飛滬轉返渝。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島六日鴛〕行政院宋院長偕參事許世瓚，秘書江秀平，伊仲究，周月梅，工程師關頌聲，大連市長沈怡及隨員多人，今日上午九時半由天津乘中航專機，於十一時二十五分飛抵青島，下榻迎賓館，旋即開始辦公，並召見全國性事業接收委員會程副主任委員義陵，午餐後，接見李市長先良等談話，明晨八時召集中共各機關駐青特派員及李市長葛主任委員等三十餘人談話。中午應美陸戰隊第六師師長哈威爾歡讌，下午離靑。</p>
<p>〔又電〕宋院長到靑後，決定（一）組織山東靑島區敵僞產業處理局審議委員會，審議接收敵僞產業之處理事項，並派彭石年等八人為委員，程義法爲秘書長。（二）爲平價出售封存敵僞物資，平抑物價起見，組織靑島日用品平價委員會，派彭石年爲主任委員，宋雪亭爲副主委。又電飭于陰歷年底前由秦皇島運煤到靑，以後分由秦皇島，連雲港源源供應。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津五日電〕宋院長在津兩日來，迭次召集，本市軍政各部門負責人員，會商有關經濟復員及接收事項。決定：（一）爲統籌河北平津區煤及汽油酒精等燃料之供應，決定設價河北平津區燃料管理委員會。會址設津，派孫越崎，王崇植，石志仁，王翼臣，凌勉之，王錫鈞，兪局奎爲委員，孫越崎爲主委，王崇植爲副主委，並由平行營及十一戰區司令長官部各派一人爲委員。（二）大量麵粉即將由國外及上海轉遝到津，平價發售，供應民食。宋氏召集善救分署長童冠賢，經部次長兼行政院長駐平辦事處主任譚伯羽，及津市長張廷諤等，會商決定組織一委員會，主管平價麵粉之分配及售價等事宜。（三）宋院長垂詢各工廠復工情形，至爲股切，於聽取各部門報告後已飭經濟部特派員，對於復工及小工廠之合作等，速擬切實辦法，以便核定進行。（四）天津至塘沽一帶各地接收倉庫，由天津市警察局派警負責警衛，並由河北省政府派各該地方警察協助。（五）在津設立清查敵產委員會分會，司淸查及密報隱匿之敵產事宜。（六）宋院長甚注意日本原在我華北之各墾業機關及其事業，已電農部周部長即來平津實地視察，擬具繼續經營辦法，（七）美海軍陸戰隊司令駱基將軍及參謀長瓦頓將軍，五日晨由杜副市長建時陪同晋謁宋院長，對於美軍在津接管日本倉庫，移交我方接收事，有所請示，宋院長已派軍政部特派員余偉業，及河北平津區敵偽產業處理局天津辦事處長師南笙等，前往接收。</p>
<h3>蔣經國離莫斯科蘇將助我接收東北各省會</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科六日電〕蔣委員長之私人代表蔣經國，於一月五日離莫斯科，在機場歡送者會條約司司長柯赤特柯夫，中國駐蘇大使傅秉常及中國大使館館員。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕中·蘇兩方似正在良好的空氣中，試行商決若干艱難的問題，據悉，宋院長曾與大速市長沈怡商討大連接收問題，並將討論結果電蔣經國與蘇方協商。按馬林諾夫斯基曾表示，大連運非其防區，而係屬於海軍，所以不能協助接收。宋沈致蔣主席電文中的內容，以記者推測，應當是請其向蘇方探詢（一）接收大通之路徑，（二）安東接收問題，據記者探悉，行營最近亦曾有照會送致馬林諾夫斯基但其內容不詳，如果最近高惜冰主席不能和其他主席一樣獲得蘇軍協助去接收，記者個人推測，他將來可能和杜聿明將軍所部一起前進。關於工礦問題，除了熊張蔣和重慶最高當局及外交當局外，連各省主席都有「丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦」的遺憾。一般高級人員也相信，東北工礦將是風雪中莫斯科談判的第一件大事。國軍大批空運東北的計劃，已經無形打消了，但是仍將有一部保安隊空運前往，這件事可以作熊式輝在津談話國軍仍將空運的最真實的註解，熊主席一度赴事，是指示駐軍如何確保踏上東北橋樑的北寗路的安全，因為在除夕左右，唐山曾經一度緊張的緣故。松江主席關吉玉，本來預備四日飛赴任，臨時因爲東北大雪，沒有成行，已改今日出發。除安東外，蘇軍將派聯絡官分頭協助接收每一個省會，但是在省會一點之外，廣大的面的接使，將是橫在各位主席面前的一個大問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕松江省主席關吉玉及秘書長並接收委員等，由平飛抵此。</p>
<h3>國軍抵瀋陽郊外</h3>
<p>〔聯合社天津六日電〕據此間所接消息，國軍開入瀋陽等待已久，終於今日獲得蘇聯同意。但以國軍不携带武器入城為條件，國軍數隊現在瀋陽郊外，可望隨時開入城內。蘇聯聯絡官三員，昨自東北來津，曾與此間中國軍官會議，徒手國軍開入瀋陽一項決定乃最近迭次會議之結果。瀋陽區域未聞國共軍隊衝突報告，多數觀察家稱，國軍接收瀋陽後，城內若有少數共軍，將歸順國軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽五日電〕陸路國軍即可進駐瀋陽，彭璧生將軍率隨員多人，今晚由新民抵此，與蘇軍聯絡，並辦理設營事宜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社天津五日電〕以杜聿明將軍所部大軍接替瀋陽城內蘇軍，似將成爲事實。據北來報告，最近經由葫蘆島開到之杜部五千人，俟中蘇談判結束後，隨時準備推進。在杜將軍待命赴瀋期間，華北方面其他活動亦稍鬆弛，共軍有小規模騷擾。</p>
<p>〔合衆社長春六日電〕據報告稱：新近成立之「特別保安團」，刻正自北平空運至長春，該團共有團員四千人，昨日飛抵長春者僅二百五十人，預定每日將有同數之團員運往該處。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕今午飛此之首批國軍，為東北行營保安隊官兵之一部分，乘巨機十架，首架機着陸時間，爲午前十一時四十分，以後每隔三分鐘降落一架，彼等皆皮衣帽，全副武裝，雖在零下二十餘度之寒風中，精神仍極飽滿。彼等自機塲赴營房途中，民衆多　集道旁，盟軍與日僑，亦於人　中揮手致歡迎之意，東北民衆久盼國軍飛來，今得目睹國軍自天而降，其歡快情况，有不能以語言形容者。</p>
<h3>杜聿明等視察阜新國軍接防北票朝陽</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州五日電〕熱河重鎭之阜新接收後，杜聿明長官偕劉多荃主席，四日冒雪馳往視察，幷布署切。阜新爲日人經營之新都市，工程僅完成三分之二，共有炭坎九處，已有八處開工，市街遭共產軍破壞。又北票已於四日下午一時，經國軍接防完畢，鐵路電話正搶修中。該處煤礦為東北重要礦產之一，據長官部方面得到報告，該處發電所已經破壞，約三兩日可修復開工。又連日以來，有彰武·瀋陽·遼陽·遼仲·鐵岑等廿餘縣市民衆代表不的而同，咸來錦州長官部致敬，均經參謀長趙家驤一一接見，予以撫慰，囑各回原地維持秩序，靜待國軍。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國軍三日奉命接防朝陽，適值大雪載途，經兩日之行程，於五日晨九時入朝陽，下午五時已接收完竣，趙軍長公武已親赴朝陽主持一切。聞熱河省政府即將進至該處辦公。</p>

<p>新任法大使梅理靄於本月五日飛抵陪都，稍事休憇，必將覲見主席，呈遞國書。大使之抵達重慶，正法艦白爾丁毓擅載戰犯離滬後之第二日。由該事件所引起之形勢，在中國人民心理中懷着高度的不滿與憤激，頓使中法關係蒙一陰影。新任法大使適於此際蒞臨陪都，其於推進中法關係上所負之使命，自非輕細。願乘此時，略就中法關係作一展望。</p>
<p>首先我們要指出的，是在擊潰日寇的努力上，法國雖不曾担負起它所應該担負的責任，而且相反地在早期的抗日戰爭中，法國反積極幫助日寇，但在戰後太平洋的局勢，我們仍以爲與法國不特無利害上的衝突，且在越南北部中國更替聯合國担負了受降的任務。我們的蔣主席一再聲明中國在越南乃至東南亞無領土的野心。如此，中法兩國在太平洋的關係固應緊密，而在現階段的國際形勢下，中法兩國尤其應該密切合作。可是正在這個時候。乃有白爾丁事件發生，是誠法國單方面所造成的中法關係上的不幸。</p>
<p>關於白爾丁事件，這裏面至少有（一）該艦擅載戰犯出口，與（二）法國在華領事裁判權的存廢這兩方面的問題。關於該艦擅載戰犯出口，實屬藐視我國主權，違背國際慣例，法國駐滬總領事旣不能防範於先，又不能補救於後，應由該艦艦長及駐滬法領事共負損害中法邦交之責。所有由該艦載去之戰犯，應即載回上海，聽候處理，一面並應由該艦艦長及駐滬法領向我政府當局道歉，保證不再發生同等事件。在本案未解次以前，所有法國海陸軍一律不准進入中國。凡此措施，旣經我外交部向法政府提出抗議，深信當能得一解次。</p>
<p>白爾丁事件所引起的另一個更嚴重的問題，是法國在華領事裁判權存廢的問題。據上海市政府向駐滬法總領事館所提之抗議內稱：外交部駐滬辦事處曾派呂秘書至法駐滬總領館面遞該處之抗議書，該總領事口頭答稱，該總領事館確曾依據法舊的所規定之領事裁判權，自行逮捕法國納粹人民卡可平諾一名，業依法國法律，將其押囚於停泊之法國兵艦，將由該艦駛運返國等語。是駐滬法國總領事館不但公然承認法國依據舊的仍復在華享有治外法權，且更有擅自在我國土拘捕人犯行爲。後者當然係根據前者而來，但倘無後者，前者僅爲意志之表示而無行爲。是駐滬法領不但表示法國在華仍享有領事裁判權，且更已單方面擅自行使是項權力。此其重要，實較白爾丁號擅載戰犯駛離上海爲甚。</p>
<p>查中法新的雖尚有待於簽字，而舊約在法理及事實上固早已廢止，不復存在。自巴黎爲納粹所陷，維琪政府倒行逆施，我國不但撤離其駐在法國之使領館人員，事實上實已與法國斷絕邦交。維琪政府之成立，使法國淪爲希特勒的附庸，戴高樂將軍雖在國外努力奮鬥，其時猶未有如在北非成立之民族解放委員會那樣的機構，足以代表法國的利益而得到國際間一般的承認。因維琪政府的成立，新政權又迄未產生，致法國不克履行其國際義務，是中法葡的在法理上已隨法國本身的崩潰而自然廢棄。至於依附於中法舊的下的各地法租借地區，亦已不復存在，尤早爲法政府所深悉。只要看今天上海早已沒有「法租界」的可恥名詞，即可瞭然。乃今法駐滬總領事，一方面公認「法租界」早已取消，而另一方面却說拘捕人犯乃依據舊約，誠屬荒謬行爲，在戰後中法關係上留一汚點！</p>
<p>我們更覺得遺憾的，在若干法僑之中，還不了然於國際的新形勢，而充滿着過去的優越感及陳腐觀念。在第二次世界大戰中，法國不但未能盡其應盡之義務，在某一意義下，且縱容日本的侵略甚而至於予以贊助。他們正應該如何糾正以往的錯誤，洗滌他們的恥辱。明白說吧，他們的傳統優越感及陳腐觀念，早已不合於世界第二次大戰後的新局勢！這次白爾丁事件的發生，說得嚴重些，中國人民有權主張，要求我政府在未獲得合法解次前宣布與法國絕交。因爲我們認爲這不僅僅是白爾丁事件，乃是戰後他國侵犯中國主權之試探。我們一定要嚴正的使這些試探無法施其技。</p>
<p>新任法大使在華多年，這次新從戰後歐洲來到中國，適當中法關係上呈着陰影，以大使的才能，深信必能將這些陰影迅速廓淸，使中法關係日趨親密。中法兩國在太平洋上，在世界局勢的重建上，需要協力；中國可以幫助法國，法國亦可以幫助中國。我們萬不能讓這白爾丁艦長和法駐滬總領事的錯誤行爲，再成爲損害中法兩國間友好關係的一個因素。</p>

<h3>日閣昨開緊急會議　將開革侵略份子　被革除閣員名單送麥帥審閱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日午夜廣播稱：今日上午十時日本內閣召集緊急會議，歷時甚久，迄午後一時始散，討論中心爲如何執行麥克阿瑟所頒佈之命令，而對於內閣閣員之成案問題，亦曾提及。按該項命令乃在禁止企圖征服全世界之日本官員参加　行政府工作。今晨召開之內閣會議，原定昨日舉行，但因有閣員三人不在東京，故延至今晨舉行。今晨討論之結果，雖未有公佈，但日政府已開始草擬將被革除谷大臣之名單，送呈麥帥審閱，定星期一召聞閣議後，再行發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京六日電〕據日內閣書記官長次田稱：內閣或僅改組，或全體辭職，須視幣原首相意見而定，准幣原認爲現尚未屆決定時間。消息靈通方面謂幣原或將改組內閣，而並不出以全體辭職，或請統帥部准許其閣員暫時留職，因指令中本有主要人員暫時留任之規定云。朝日新聞載副秘書長三美稱：吉田外相大約將赴統帥部，以期詳悉指令內容，擬請求麥帥准許日本全體閣員暫留原任至大選後再行退職，至大選日期現尚未定，惟統帥部方面則謂並未接獲與麥帥會晤之請求。自美國陸軍部長柏德遜抵日後，統帥部中異常忙碌。執行麥帥指令，日政府已準備兩項法令，內容頗爲複雜，且係實行波茨坦宣言所定條件之緊急方式：日本一部份報紙，認爲依照麥帥指令，日閣員中不染侵略色彩者僅幣原吉田兩人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕日本政府今日已擬就法令，革退所有領導日本作戰之官員。此係麥帥指令肅淸侵略份子之第一個具體結果。據內閣發言人稱：此項法令將於星期一閣議提出，　　新開社評稱：幣原首相及其內閣，或將因此項新指令而全體辭職。各政黨似亦難免有崩泄之虞，蓋議會改選在即，而競選議員多屬戰時渣滓也。</p>
<h3>日內閣全體閣員　是否將總辭今明即可見分曉</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京六日電〕據日本發言人稱：日本內閣不致辭職。預料內閣今晚將繼續舉行閣議，討論麥帥新命令是否將促使內閣全體辭職，或若干閣員是否將被迫辭職之迫切問題。幣原首相因感冒不能出席晨間舉行之閣議，吉田外相亦未出席。閣議麥帥曾命令凡領導日本人民作戰之官員應一律革退，閣議開始即討論如何執行此項命令。合衆社記者向出席閣議之堀切搖首微笑，答稱不知。據消息靈通之日人稱：無論內閣之命運如何，堀切內相或將被迫辭城。吉田外相昨曾與幣原會商，旋覲見日皇，對麥帥新命令有所商談。據稱麥帥新命令引起日本貴族院存在問題，貴族阮議員二十八人已以戰犯嫌疑被狗，其中十五人已自動提出辭呈，據日方猜測，另有十五人將被迫辭職，按貴族院共有議員四百十二人。</p>
<h3>日閣員被革退者至少有六人　內相農相文相等</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京六日電〕幣原內閣今晨舉行緊急會議，討論麥帥肅淸一切黷武主義份子之指令。據稱：日本內閣中須初革退者爲內相堀切（曾任大政翼贊會理事），內閣書記官長兼不管部大臣次田·農相松村及文相前田等六人。消息最靈通者則謂幣原或將維持現內閣，僅將此輩閣員免職，另以新人接替。惟社會民主黨則要求幣原內閣全體辭職。朝日新聞今日社論，亦謂幣原內閣庸弱無能，不能負責，應予退避云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日午夜廣播稱：今日東京各報一致認爲麥帥之新訓令，將給予日本以新的領導，每日新聞評論云：「我人以往之改革，均係屬於表面上的」，朝日新聞則指麥帥之新命令，爲「建造新日本之更進一步」。</p>
<h3>美國務院官員談麥帥之職權可有權另委新閣</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕國務院官員今日聲稱：如幣原內閣因麥帥之肅淸日政府精武分子指令而倒閣，相信麥帥可有權另委一新內閣。莫斯科三强外畏會議公報，曾將委任日本新內閣之權，保留與四强管制委員會，但國務院官員指陳，星期四國務卿貝爾納斯告記者稱：該公報載有賦權與麥帥補充內閣虛席閣員之一節，故其規定條款實已大減其效能。記者詢以該委會是否祗有權委任幣原之繼承者，國務院官員答曰：日「吾」據指稱：根據此項指令，麥帥得委人繼續維持現內閣。觀察家表示，即使內閣全體辭職，麥帥可於今日委任一人，明日另委他人，完全在個人基礎上補充虛位。國務院方面又稱。對於目前日內閣危機問題，並未接到蘇聯之任何諮詢云。</p>

<p>市體協會主辦之籃球義寶，昨日第二夕，市體育館內觀衆相當擁擠，全部收入均充敎育貸金，門票收入，共爲十八萬〇九百元。球賽第二塲開始時，由敎育局顧局長行開球禮，賽畢仍柏賣義球，須文祥君以十五萬元拍得。兩塲簡情如次：</p>
<p>華南與美信號隊先行對壘，華南謹愼應戰，何金貴李瑞雄活躍之至，李賢政最為賣力，上半時華南以十四對十二勝一球。下半時華南一鼓作氣，瞬獲五分，佔絕對優勢，美軍反攻，史茄別奧佛蘭等有投皆中，又成拉鋸形勢，至二十六對二十五時尚餘三秒鐘，何金貴犯規，奧佛關兩擲中的，華南終以一分之差慘遭敗北，比數爲二六對二七。</p>
<p>第二塲華聯對江灣隊，華聯昨有用游擊戰之意，上場未用最佳陣容，卒造成追隨局面，上半時十六對十二江澤隊勝四分。下半時華聯重整陣容，震中勃脫出塲，震中學崇各獲一球，扳成平手，大有轉機希望。觀衆歡呼不絕，華聯求勝心切，操之過急，頻失良機，江灣隊乘隙而入，華聯竟以廿五對三〇惜敗。</p>

<p>比賽准於二時半開始，猶太原擬邀請之義將麥尼蒂鮑傑二人，均雖帶有球鞋，而終未上塲，聞係義僑當局之反對，結果兩義將未上塲，全班猶太佬應戰。總以爲靑白值此良機，大可一鼓而下，生擒猶太，初不料結果竟如此之慘，以一對二敗北，誠令萬千球迷，同聲嘆息。</p>
<p>上半時由李碩友射中先開紀錄，未幾即被溫脫報復射進，成一對一和局。下半時麥列希一蹴中的，成二比一，靑白雖竭力反攻，挽救乏術，結果二對一敗於猶太。靑白前鋒散漫無律，失却連絡，爲失敗之主因。</p>

<h3>法艦載運戰犯離滬　我外部提出抗議　法總領事盼維持中法友誼</h3>
<p>因公入京之外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉，於獲得法艦白爾丁號擅戰法籍戰犯駛離上海報告以後，業於昨晨兼程返滬，以便親自主持有關本案之一應交涉事宜。昨日陳氏召見呂秘書以次各要員，對本案初步交涉經過，詳加諮詢據悉本案已由王外長世杰，逕向法政府提出抗議，駐滬辦事處在外部訓令到滬以前，暫不採取新措置。</p>
<p>駐滬法兩總領事費禮浩，爲表明其對於法巡艦白爾丁號載法奸卡可平諾離滬赴西貢事件之立塲，昨日二度接見記者發表談話，據稱：「法艦事件，近日已數度登載報章，此本爲地方事件，余等深信煩近將來，中法政府定有完滿解決辦法，余盼望最近抵達重慶之新任駐華法大使梅里藹氏，對於中法邦交有良好之措施。梅氏乃中國良友，當在最短期間，促進中法之友誼。就余個人而言，余實無時不努力於上海中法間傳統之友誼也」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕法總領事費禮浩昨日表示對白爾丁號違法出口，認爲地方事件，據外交界昨日嚴正表示，則認爲此乃法方未能尊重我國主權，不但法總領事應負全責，即法政府亦應負相當責任。</p>
<p>法總領事實係違法</p>
<p>關於法艦白爾丁號不顧我國抗戰擅將戰爭罪犯卡可平諾載運離滬抵西貢，本市各界甚為重視，本報記者特訪本市在野之某外交界領袖叩訊關於該案意見，據云：法總領事對於此案之處置，顯係失當，根據國際法，中法廢除領事裁判權之條約，雖未經正式批准，然該草約早經兩國簽駐，况中國政府復於三十二年五月十九日照會法代辦，聲明所有法國依據不平等條約所取得之領事裁判權及其他特權，皆行廢除。法代辦復於三十四年十二月照會中國政府聲稱：法領事法庭皆已停止執行審訊案件。依照上述經過，法領館警察之逮捕法戰犯卡可平諾，實係違法之行動。且我市政府及外交部駐滬辦事處，均已在該犯逮捕後提出口頭及書面抗議，而該法總領事竟置我抗議於不顧，私將該犯用法艦押送離滬，此種行動，實係藐視我國主權。</p>
<p>案關重大必須力爭</p>
<p>該領事在對記者談話時曾聲稱：渠方於一月半前自巴黎來滬，對於處理此項事件極感生疏，此項解說，實屬意圖推卸責任，在國際法上絕無任何根據。該總領事又稱：對於廢除領事裁判權及處置法戰犯案件，尚未接得法政府通知，此說更係推諉之詞，蓋法代辦於照會我外交部時曾聲明，關於停止領事法庭執行審訊事已分別通知法駐華各領館知照在案，該駐滬法領事豈有未接得法大使館通知之可能。外交家繼稱：此次非法逮捕及私運罪犯案件似係有計劃之行動，法總領事實蓄意破壞中國主權造成已成事實，以謀取得外交上之先例，企圖將來繼續援用。該外交家復對記者强調謂：此次案件，我政府若不採取强硬態度，而謀有效之處置，則各國皆得援用此案之先例，而使廢除領事裁判權之各種條約成爲具文，此案關係之重大，實足引起我政府民衆密切之注意。</p>
<p>中國法庭有權制裁</p>
<p>該外交家復稱：法總領事係商務官而非外交官，故其違法行爲，應負中國法律上所制訂之一切責任，均得受中國法律及法庭之處置，該法總領事館警察其存在旣係非法，則中國軍警得依法予以裁制。在該案未獲得解決前，中國政府得依法停止法總領事館一切活動，並禁止法商船及軍艦進入中國港口。</p>

<p>貨物　商品方面，食米到貨每日平均一萬五千担，常局且在訂購暹米，價平疲，麵粉因天津每包九千元，北運多而價堅，黄豆興化幫泉州帮買進，豆餅台灣汕頭厦門帮暢購，每片重五十市斤者，已高至二千零七十五元，棉籽餅可供廠方燃料甩，價高至二千一百五十元，油糖因平價油糖準備發售稍平，但內地如常州等處因黄豆原料缺，油價反比滬市高，棉紗先因汕頭厦門南京杭州採購二十支紗而漲，旋因香港廣東搜買二十支雙馬紗愈俏，突見新高價八十五萬元，自三十二年僞棉統會收買全滬棉紗棉布後，滬地存紗寥寥，名貴老牌貨尤難得，客帮視此弱點而搜羅，故米價雖比戰前漲七百倍，紗價獨漲三千四百倍，棉布因川帮進士林色布，染織廠猛進白坯細布，十二磅龍頭每疋見新高價三萬六千元，棉花廠方與花號搜囤甚股，通州美種花每担高至八萬七千元，比十二月中旬低峯昂起一倍餘，生絲出口洋莊銷路多，漲十萬元，人造絲綢廠吸進漲四·五萬元，絲織品平庸，針織品隨紗市而上，捲烟華廠有派貨，英美烟隨國烟軟弱，燃料品因冬令與存底關係，白煤塊每噸升四萬元，柴爿煤球亦各漲一二百元，火柴堅定，肥皂洋燭川帮止辦小跌。（重伯）</p>
<h3>出口商渴望早定外匯率</h3>
<p>新匯率仍密雲不雨，輸出商人中頗爲煩惱，據某輸出商談：我國對外貿易品仍以茶，桐油，猪鬃，生絲，羊毛爲大宗，戰前我國茶之產量，佔世界產量百分之四十五，年產約九萬萬磅，出口數爲二十一萬九千七百餘公担，桐油佔世界產額百分之九十四强，國內以川，湘，桂，黔四省全部及鄂西陜南爲最，廣西擁有千年桐油，每年輸出達十三萬四千餘公祖，且全國年收十萬餘公担，猪鬃銷塲頗富，年出口達五千一百餘公担，生絲一千七百餘公担，羊毛約十三萬二千餘公担，如新匯率即能決定，是項貿易必可活躍。</p>

<h3>重慶物價數</h3>
<p>民國三十四年，商塲之亂，爲抗戰以來前所未有，通貨膨脹，為戰前的一千餘倍，社會購買力降低，不及戰前百分之十，物價高漲，幾達戰前二千四百餘倍，茲將聯合徵信所近數年重慶物價指數抄錄如下，</p>
<p>（廿六年物價指數基數爲一）</p>
<p>二十六年　一，一</p>
<p>二十七年　一，三</p>
<p>二十八年　二</p>
<p>二十九年　六</p>
<p>三十年　一七</p>
<p>三十一年　五一</p>
<p>三十二年　一三六</p>
<p>三十三年　三一六</p>
<p>三十四年　一月　四九二</p>
<p>二月　五六六</p>
<p>三月　七三四</p>
<p>四月　九六三</p>
<p>五月　一〇四〇</p>
<p>六月　一〇八四</p>
<p>七月　二三〇四</p>
<p>八月　二四一六</p>
<p>九月　二〇八二</p>
<p>十月　二〇三七</p>
<p>十一月　二三七三</p>
<p>十二月</p>
<p>由上表可知，三十四年下期比上期物價加倍，三十四年較之三十三年約漲七倍，就全國而論，除昆明以外，要居首位，（在太平洋戰事爆發前，全國各重要城市物價最高者，重慶爲首，惟自三十年度起，昆明因外資主道，投機風行，故取重慶而代之，據統計：三十四年八月物價指數重慶爲二千四百一十六倍，昆明則爲七千四百五十三倍，較重慶約高三倍以上。）</p>
<h3>紐約棉市堅穩</h3>

<h3>略論作品</h3>
<p>— 星華</p>
<p>我記得有個法國作家曾經這樣說過：『枯燥的文章歷經時代好像是一具不會腐敗的木乃伊，可是其他的文章，充滿了浮肉和脂肪，而又裝飾着華麗的辭藻。到了後世人家只能從他們的墳墓里掘取若干的冠冕，以及戒指和飾物而已』。如今，那些偉大的古典作品，就是一個鋼鐵般的明證。從而，我們亦能藉此得到一個解答，行世傳遠的作品不僅是倚靠華麗的辭藻的。同時，這亦就是許多富麗堂皇的作品，被歷史所摒棄的同一緣由。</p>
<p>當Emile　Zola寫羅恭瑪加兒家史（“Les　Rougon-Mac-quarl”）在報章上發表的時節，當時他蒙受到一種出於意料之外的打擊（這可以說是一般忠實於一個時代社會的作家的必然遭遇，相反，亦是這個作家的成功的佐證）。甚至還有一個劣質的批評者狂吠道；「出賣祖國！簡直是把他自己身上的蛆蟲向純潔的人羣堆里拋」。這該是一部深入社會核心的作品的一個反應，至少，法國的一羣『純潔的人羣』，該已經發現他們國民的身上已經是生了蛆蟲的了。在中國，一些作家之所以受到人們的攻擊，亦正因其毫無遮蓋地剝露中國腐朽社會的緣故。</p>
<p>今日的蘇聯文學不能與往昔的帝俄時代同日而語，只要一讀A託爾斯泰的論文就知道，例如；二十五年來的蘇維埃文學中有云，『……精神範疇在這次戰爭中，取得決定的角色。語言已經不只是在人心裏燃熾着的煤炭，語言像千百萬的刺刀去衝鋒陷陣，語言具有砲隊密擊的力量』。</p>
<p>假如基於以上的成法來作為銓衡過去上海文壇的尺度，那我不知道結果該是怎樣。我只是想（請注意只是想想！），我們要不要去探求它的結果呢？（縱使我們知道結果會是那樣的糟）</p>
<p>現代的蘇俄作家們，不止一回二一回的提出古典作品的再估價。他們坦白的說陀斯妥亦夫斯基式的憂鬱已經是過去的時代的陳跡了，這，昭然若揭的說實了他們的進步，反之，我們能說一聲打倒無病呻吟與空聲吶喊嗎？——回答照樣是不能。老實說，在幾十本千篇一律的戀愛小說中，還不能找得出像古典的林黛玉那樣成功的人物，雖然狡滑的作家們把她們穿上時式的旗袍，塗上最近由法國來的唇膏，那，亦是無濟於事的。</p>
<p>說來非常可笑（實在倒是可恥！），我們幾個專寫革命與愛情衝突（？）的青年作家中，他們竟連革命是怎麼一回事亦不曾弄明白呢！至於說到非常Smar的一個名辭；二重人格，他們又老是掛在專爲呷Coffee　Kiss喝威士忌的口邊。他們的詮釋是：去革一革命再去戀一戀愛者是。</p>
<p>關於舉例，我也不想了，實在是『俯拾即是」。</p>
<h3>提防</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>元旦日，像春天一樣的早晨，我們在大街上散步，爲着所有的車輛，行人打這一天起全都改着「靠右邊走」了，乍開始的時候，誰都有一絲戒心，因此一切全呈現着緩慢的情調。</p>
<p>我素來害怕上海的緊張生活，那飛也似的車輛，急匆匆的路人，忙的人忙，不忙的人也忙，急的事急，不急的事也急，好像永遠沒有休息的時候，要休息就除非獃在家裏。</p>
<p>想不到這樣一來，爲了靠右邊走，將那過度的緊張空氣給調整了。於是我們遂能在這滿是暖洋洋日光的大街上自在的走着，看汽車姗姗的開過，電車遲遲的行駛。</p>
<p>我笑起來。小心謹愼的凱藍說：「我却不能像你一樣的好整以暇，多少總得有些提防。」</p>
<p>「提防，是呀！」我跟她說：「我並沒有不提防，我相信我能够記着這就算了，難道還爲此特製一件左大襟的衣裳嗎？』</p>
<p>凱藍笑了，又叮囑着：「自然，我們是能够提防着自已小心的，但是，你能够提防着別人的不小心嗎？』</p>
<p>我十分注意她這話，並且願意永遠不忘，因爲這不單在我「靠石邊走」的時候應該記着，甚至在我們跑過艱難的人生旅途時候也一樣的應該留神這一點。</p>
<h3>朱應鵬畫展</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利後第一個元旦，去參觀朱應鵬先生的盡展，眞是何等愉快！尤其我們研究藝術的人。朱先生是藝術界老前輩，也是中國文藝運動的健將之一，有很多貢獻，值得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>朱先生在抗戰期間，蟄居海上，堅貞自守，書畫自遣，這次展覽會中作品，便是他八年中的收穫。全部作品有一百五十點，分爲五室，人物約占五分之二，山水花鳥等的占五分之三，融會中西畫於一爐，而充分保持着國畫的獨特風格。人物畫中，都是歷代民族英雄的造像，關羽。岳武穆·文天祥·戚繼光等等，這一點，頗堪注意，朱先生在此時此地描寫我民族的威儀，意義之深切，感化力之偉大，有不可想像的成效，而况衣折綫條約流利活潑，所謂　衣出水，吳帶當風，這地可以兼而有之。至於神情儀　，莊嚴肅穆，並不受畫幅的巧小所限制，這更是朱先生的獨詣。</p>
<p>山水畫中，要推「松石」和「靑綠」等數幀，前者是摹擬雲林，一種雅淡簡潔的氣息，洋溢紙面，沒有烟雲的烘染，烟　却充滿在畫面，這不是阿其所好，我想識者所共實的。後者爲積式尺頁，裝成立軸，山並不太高，而點綴着小小的水閣，便顯得山峰聳拔；水並不太深，而參差着數行林木，便顯得秋水迢迢。古人云：咫尺之內有千里之勢，吾於朱先生作品中見之。朱先生在跋語中：李思訓靑綠不免刻畫，…王石谷致力三十年始悟其法，的確，朱先生深知靑綠傳遞蛻變之跡，無怪有如此的成功。</p>
<p>這次花鳥占少數，梅花水仙之類，品雖小而韵味不小，朱先生的懷抱，抗戰期間的懷抱，在這幾幀花烏畫裏，完全象徵得明明白白，「鶴鳴九臯」尤爲出色，題着：「自惜羽毛淸，廻立風塵上，老氣橫秋歌，一鳴天地響！」四句，何等闊天！最後，我覺得中國畫，原來要全面配合，詩書畫三絕，缺一不可，朱先生作品上，每幀有很多題跋，字跡亦娟秀蒼勁，書卷氣十分濃厚，堪稱當代不多見的全能畫家。</p>
<h3>讀詩論感</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>偶然聯想到陸放翁詩：「新雁南來片影孤，冷雲深處宿菰蒲；不知湘水巴陵路，曾記漁陽上谷無！」此情此景，恍比昨宵的月冷霜重，空中似聞雁呌的情狀。又放翁的「龍興寺弔少陵先生寓居」詩：「中原草木失承平，戍火胡塵到兩京：扈蹕老臣身萬里，犬寒來此聽江聲。」頭兩句，在七八年來，已經如是，末兩句，似爲我早晨倚蘭挽瞰嘉陵江的寫照。這是去年冬間的感想，今日回想起來，流光掠影，似是昨日的事。</p>
<p>梁啓超題劍南詩集；「詩界千年靡靡風，兵魂銷盡國魂空；集中十九從軍樂，亘古男兒一放翁。」字裏行間，對於放翁的詩句，確是推崇備至了。可是一千多年，只說得一個放翁，未免阿其所好，而抹煞其他的詩人。曹子建的「白馬篇：」「長驅蹈匈奴，左顧凌鮮卑；棄身鋒刃端，性命安可懷。父母且不顧，何言子與妻。名編壯士籍，不得　中私，捐軀赴國難，視死忽如歸！」慷慨激昂，詞意豪壯。「父母且不顧」連續幾句，古來詩家，似還沒有說過。和阮嗣宗「詠懷」詩：『一身不自保，何况戀妻子！」語氣相同。然而曹詩是悲壯，阮詩則悽厲，是有些不同罷了。賈似道詩：「十年磨一劍，霜刃未曾試；今日把似君，誰有不平事？」我們十多年來最不平之事，還有過於整個國家民族遭受倭寇的侵略壓逼嗎？霜刃應向訛試，不待問，也衆口一辭的是要加在敵人的豆油子上了。但是勝利來臨，我們本着大國民風度，不和他取報復主義。然而賈詩所說的，難道盡是「靡靡風」。梁啓超嗜痂成癖，把其他作品，置之度外，未免失於公平。</p>
<p>「鐵馬渡河風破肉，雲梯攻壘雪平壕。獸奔鳥散何勞逐，直斬單于　寶刀。」　胡束手仗天亡，棄田縱橫滿戰塲。雪上急追奔馬跡，官軍夜半人遼陽。」這是放翁「雪中忽起從戎之興戲作」四首中的兩首。此次中央軍「夜半入遼陽」，收復東九省，就是有這樣的壯烈景象。</p>
<h3>憶江南</h3>
<p>— 陳淦閣</p>
<p>我欲寄情自遙遠的北國，不但不能投遞沉鬱着久遠的鄕思，而無限往事的回味，反而加深了。唯有讓無盡的感槪，痛苦地，慘淡地暫時寄託在心之深處，由它盤旋！</p>
<p>方我離開這水鄕，正是柳暗花明的季節，滿山坡披滿了桃紅，斜影入微波的湖水中。你道是我健忘嗎？我還能告訴你：一羣五六歲的弟妹們，爭先搶入了停在湖畔的小舟，搖拽着盪到了江心，用他們白嫩的小手，奪着採那朵剛放的荷花；你急得錯踏了稻田，奔過去阻止。可是他們的一羣，擁着新生的花走上了彼岸，並且，不時轉過頭來，向你打個哈哈！</p>
<p>久惦念着的蘊藻浜，現在不知怎麼了？那邊有着大石砌成的堤壩，每年夏天，有許多附近的居民，光着身子，從岸邊走入了江水，直向江中的水塔行去，炎陽把江水　得太暖和了，拍在他們身上，把皮膚灼得發紫，遠遠地望去，呵，那邊還有幾個浮動的影子，在那兒追逐那三夾水的銀帶呢。　轉眼又是春天了，夕陽中的龍華古刹，矗立在雜色的桃花叢中，益顯得它雄偉和莊嚴！或須它現在蒼老得多了，但是數十年來，它已閱盡人間多少的悲歡，搬演了多少人間的雜劇呵</p>
<p>江南的景色，八年長時間的隔絕，即使蒙上了不潔，也很快地有人類爲它洗塵；而那殉難的人羣，却從此脫離了明媚的家鄉。就我說，也許會重臨那滿山桃紅的所在，俯視湖畔；也許那邊還留有一艘破舟，但決不會再有五六歲的弟妹們重來嬉戲了。他們受着時代的洗禮，不但每一個後輩都已亭亭玉立，並且他們都成長了一，顆沉着的心，但他們幼年天眞的形態，却從此跟隨殉難的人羣一同消逝，永不會回頭！</p>
<p>身處遙遠的北國，眼見着高山深水，阻隔住一片江南平靜的湖光山色，能不興歎？但逝水流光，冬盡又復春來，到那時，仍有那麼多的靑年男女，穿挿在桃紅柳綠之間；而關寨仍是萬里荒漠，漫無人烟，焉能不增加旅人的歸志？再抬頭照鏡時，又將補上了幾條皺紋。</p>
<p>「童年呢？」</p>
<h3>步清閣十二月十七日春秋原韻</h3>
<p>— 羅髫漁</p>
<p>文會東林幸不孤，人間正氣喜相扶，淹留我感心魂苦，夢轉昆湖又太湖。</p>
<p>除夕寄自渝州</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>貪污·淫糜</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>如今之世，貪汚豈僅「官」也哉？假如我們淸算一下國民正當的總收入，和它的實際的總支出，就知道很多的都有貪汚的嫌疑。</p>
<p>貪汚不可赦，凡貪汚的「官」，應該一律嚴辦，從判徒刑到槍決，凡貪汚的「民」，也應該一律從根本上予以懲罰。</p>
<p>假如，我們把正當收入，定爲：「用勞動（包括用體力與用腦力）所取得的應得的報酬」的話，那末，凡不用勞動而取得或用勞動取得而超過應得一切物質，皆爲非正當的收入。非正當的收入，是什麼？實在就是貪汚。　因此，受賄的官吏是貪汚，利用職權而圖私人之利者是貪汚，在接收時爲自己爲朋友而亂用封條是貪汚，拿Commission的庶務先生是貪汚，而投機家，奸商，囤積居奇者亦無不皆爲貪汚人物。</p>
<p>貪汚的根源是在生活的糜費與不量入爲出，自然最根本的原因是在私有財產制度的存在。我們可以去打聽打聽，安分的勞工，誠樸的農民，他們那一個是貪汚？貪汚與奢侈不分家，凡生活奢侈者，必然貪汚，必須貪汚，所以我們反貪汚，同時要反奢侈。</p>
<p>一個月入不到十十萬元的高級公務員，他請一次客，可以化上二十萬，參加一次賭博，可以輸上三十萬，五十萬，在舞場裏可以漏夜的跳，為博得舞女的歡心，一次可以送金鋼鑽戒子兩只以上，你說他不貪汚怎麼辦？同時，我們要偵察貪汚，亦非常容易，凡生活奪得糜，舉止闊綽者，大槪也就是貪汚者。</p>
<p>提高生活水凖，是要大夥兒提高，並不是只提高幾個人。根絕貪汚最根本的辦法，自然要從改革社會制度上着手，中國的社會，不願意把它製造成為一個資本主義的社會，這改革也是容易的。其次，較根本的辦法，也應從該改造社會風氣的一點上着手？</p>
<p>根絕貪污，只在貪污的本身上打算盤，那個効果實在太少。在上海現在又展開新生活運動了，禮養廉恥，貪污的從何知恥？要實現新生活，必須根絕各種各樣的貪污，才談得上「知恥」，談得上新生活！</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（一）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「時代的巨浪，捲去了腐爛的渣滓，接着，又捲來了新世紀的誕生。」</p>
<p>中華民國，便建立在這個「新世紀」的光輝裏！　那些「渣滓」，有的順流而下，沒有了着落，有的便沉陷在汚泥裏！</p>
<p>沉陷在汚泥裏的渣滓，永遠不乾不凈的浸在陰冷與潮濕中但偶而也受到陽光的寵惠，日子久了，渣滓也會變成了精華！</p>
<p>渣滓變成了一精華」以後，牠便不復能再在「汚泥」中生存下去。牠需要登岸昇華，可是，汚泥中的蚯蚓蛇蠍會包圍着牠，把牠更往深處拖！同時，「岸」距離地是那麼高；那麼遠；要攀上去，確不是一件很容易的事。而且，那金碧輝煌前岸垣，常常不會容留牠這汚泥中的產物。於是牠從汚泥到岸上，要費許多掙扎的氣力。要承受許多無情的擺殘！</p>
<p>這樣，便有若干的精華，依舊埋葬在汚泥裏！他們，翻不了身；牠們，放不出光彩；牠們的損失，便是宇宙的損失！</p>
<p>世界史上，那些不朽的事，物；都是由渣滓中陶鍊出來的精華成功的。同樣，人類史上，那些英雄豪傑；也都是由渣滓中陶鍊出來的精華成功的。正如：金子是從砂裏淘出來的。</p>
<p>渣滓，可以變成精華，而天然的精華；或則是雕琢的精華；也可以變成渣滓。所以，我們不要輕視渣滓就是廢物；我們要隨時注意渣滓中，也會鍊出燦爛的精華；而且在發現之後，要好好地培育牠；愛護牠。宇宙上的一切進化，就全賴着這些精華。</p>
<p>但是，精華空間少，世界史上，沒有太多不朽的事，物；人類史上，沒有太多的英雄，豪傑；所以宇宙上的一切進化，也便搶劫得很慢。</p>
<p>三十五年內，中國的社會；外表化，像一池濾過了的淸水；但實際上，却漏下無數舊社會的餘毒細菌；牠們潛伏在社會的各階層；而繁殖，蔓延；至於產生一種黑暗的勢力；造成無數可怕的罪惡—結果，這池淸水，只粉粧了浮面；內中却是一踏糊塗；且逐漸盪漾起昏沌的漣漪，甚而波及「浮面」的平靜！</p>
<p>渣滓和「細菌」不同，渣滓，是一種被唾棄的多餘的東西；而細菌，是一種陰謀性的蠶蝕者。渣滓多了，頂多使你發生一種厭惡之感；而不像細菌，牠使你恐怖，牠足以發生破壞，與毀減的力量；牠可以毒化一個人的身體；可以毒化一個社會的制度；也可以毒化一個國家的政策；更可以毒化整個世界的潮流。</p>
<p>犧牲在「細菌毒化」下的人民，社會，國家，不知凡幾；差一點整個世界都被傾覆了！</p>
<p>欲人民安樂；欲社會寗靜；欲國家强盛；欲世界太平；就只有肅淸細菌；撲滅細菌。</p>
<p>所以，時代的巨浪，僅捲去了腐爛的渣滓還不够；必須要澈底濾盡　化的細菌；才能使新世紀的誕生，無恙；健康！」</p>

<h3>防止匪患應速組織「民警團」</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>翻開報紙，差不多天天可以讀到盜刧綁案的新聞，值此冬防期間，當局正以全力鞏固於市內的治安，不幸而仍舊產生這種惡果，爲全市五百萬人民之安全計，能不令人杞憂！目前各警察分局對於緝捕工作，似乎非常努力，我們認爲於其在事後加緊緝捕，何不設法防患於未然，維持治安的責任，原不能整個推到警局身上去，上海區域之廣，警力自感不足，市民爲自身安全計，就應立即拿出自己的力量來組織「民警團」。</p>
<p>過去敵偽時期，亦曾有此類似的組織——自警團，但由於管理制度和人事的腐敗，幾年以來，市民對此不無怨言，勝利之後，不久遂告消滅，然而事實上，我們不容吾認這種用民衆集團的警力來防止匪徒和不良份子的混跡蠢動，確是最能表效的對策。結果終使其無所遁形而歸於銷聲匿跡。自警團之功，實不可沒。最近本市保甲組織亦已整理完善，祇消把過去不良的制度予以改革，選擇各區保甲中優秀份子來負責辦理，駕輕就熟，自可事半而功倍。市民方面祗不過犧牲一些有限的精神和時間，便能得到生命財產的保障，則又何怨之尤！</p>
<p>匪徒犯獗的主因，我們仍不能歸罪於目前失業人數的增多和物價的飛漲，祇要工廠快些開工，失業者都有了工作，物偎下跌，人人可以很容易的裝飽肚子，這般匪徒又何必鋌而走險，定要幹這賣命生涯呢！因此要積極的根除匪患，還有待於當局對於這兩個問題的解決。</p>
<h3>調整小職員待遇　向敵機應予澈查</h3>
<p>編者先生：自從戰事發生以後，最感痛苦的，莫過於我們靠薪水過活的公司小職員，平時因爲沒有背景關係，無論辦事如何努力，加薪機會極少，一月收入，往往不足養活一夫一妻，茲就筆者服務之公司諭，規模雖相當巨大（戰前資本已達一千一百餘萬元）但小職員待遇非常菲薄，當太平洋戰事發生，公司即實行薪金不公開辦法，一面取銷小職員津貼（柴米油布四貼），一面提高少數特殊人員薪金，同時凡參與黑市交易者，當局逢節另發特獎，因之造成小職員愈苦，特殊人員愈當之現象。最令人痛心疾首者，公司不惜巨資獨購一機獻給敵人，另再特備禮物四百箱贈與聯絡敵軍人員，據筆者調查所知，此次公司所費，足敷公司全體小職員卅餘年之薪金而有餘，公司此種行爲，不獨苛待小職員，且有資敵嫌疑，尚望賢明之社會局，設法予以糾正之。鄧良上</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] In order to make the content of the Political Consultative Conference public so that people at home and abroad can understand it, the government will allow journalists to audit the conference during its opening period, but the quota is limited to no more than 38, the total number of all members. It is also learned that 15 foreign journalists will participate in the auditing. In addition, Lei Zhen has been appointed as the Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference. The secretariat was officially established on the 6th, and the staff of the secretariat have been transferred from the secretariat of the National Political Council and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association and the Economic Construction Promotion Association of the council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A tea party for all members of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 7th at the Zeng Bao Room of the Military Affairs Commission to exchange views on general issues. In addition, the delegation of the Chinese Youth Party attending the Political Consultative Conference hosted a lunch on the 6th to invite non-party representatives to exchange views on the Political Consultative Conference. Many representatives spoke, and their opinions were very close. They dispersed happily at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai to Hold First Meeting Today to Formulate Concrete Measures to Stop Conflict and Restore Transportation; Negotiating Representatives to Discuss Agenda Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, midnight on the 6th, broadcast: The negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party have made significant progress. Two concrete meetings will be held in Chongqing on the 7th. (1) The Marshall-Zhang Qun-Zhou Enlai Three-Person Committee will hold its first meeting, chaired by Marshall, to formulate concrete measures to stop conflict and restore transportation. (2) The 38 representatives of the Consultative Conference will hold their first informal meeting to discuss the agenda and voting methods for the first general assembly opening on January 10th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] US Information Service report: Special Envoy Marshall visited Chairman Chiang at 11:30 AM on the 5th and had lunch with him.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai declared: The ceasefire order agreed upon by the Kuomintang and Communist representatives yesterday will be issued three days before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. According to Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji, the draft of the ceasefire order is being considered by both sides and will be submitted to General Marshall. This order does not apply to the Nine Eastern Provinces because the Nine Eastern Provinces are not areas of conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The omission of the Nine Eastern Provinces from this draft implies that the Communist Party has recognized the National Army's takeover of the Northeast or is part of an exchange of conditions between the two sides, but it has not been announced.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai expressed optimism after his first meeting with government representative Zhang Qun, Chairman of Sichuan Province. He said that the Central Government has fully agreed to the Communist Party's plan to restore all transportation (including railways, postal services, telecommunications, and aviation). It is believed that the Political Consultative Conference will be able to increase pressure to enable both sides of the dispute to reach practical agreements. The date for the actual cessation of conflict has not yet been determined. The Communist Party stated that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will soon issue a joint communique. Well-informed sources point out that even if the conflict can be stopped immediately, it will not necessarily guarantee the final resolution of the fundamental problems. However, people from all walks of life today believe that the negotiations will reach their highest stage. Special Envoy Marshall is still studying the various aspects of the internal situation in China and is obviously taking a cautious attitude towards the progress of the negotiations. It was previously reported that Special Envoy Marshall would go to Yan'an, but according to members of Special Envoy Marshall's staff, this will not happen until the unity negotiations have reached an agreement or have completely broken down. In addition, Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet on Sunday to entertain all the representatives of the National Political Council. The Communist Party is scheduled to hold a cocktail party on Monday afternoon to entertain people from all walks of life and has sent out 400 invitations. General Marshall is also among those invited.</p>
<p>The Inner Mongolia Goodwill Mission Will Depart in Groups</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Inner Mongolia, which will become China's official northern border in the future, is currently in turmoil under complex factors. The Inner Mongolia Goodwill Mission led by Bai Yunti is currently waiting here to take off. They will be divided into several groups and depart separately for the Northeast and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. It is not yet certain which group Bai Yunti himself will join. De Wang is also spending the winter in Beiping, and he has a rather negative influence on Inner Mongolia. News of new turmoil in Inner Mongolia comes from the Xing'an area of ​​the Northeast, where there is already a "People's Committee." It currently has 20,000 troops reorganized from puppet troops and is still continuing to recruit soldiers. The chairman of this "People's Committee" is Bao Baochen, and the secretary-general is Ma Mingzhou. Another important figure is Tong Xiweng, leader of the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party. According to recent news, the Chahar-Suiyuan Communist Army has also become passive recently, transporting large quantities of goods from Zhangjiakou westward every day. Conversely, the official authorities here are increasingly optimistic about the situation in Chahar-Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The US State Department stated today: The United States will accept any resolution reached by the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the status of Outer Mongolia. Chongqing officially announced that China recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty. This was decided after repeated consultations between Marshal Stalin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and Chiang Ching-kuo in Moscow.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Tax Revenue Increases Daily; Coastal Salt Farms Recover</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] After recovery and adjustment, the Guangdong Customs' tax revenue has been increasing sharply, now reaching 10 million yuan per day. More than 60 million yuan has been collected in the two months since the recovery. After the resumption of remittances to Southeast Asia, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese reaches about 300 to 400 million yuan per month, which has a great impact on the livelihoods and economy of various places. At the same time, as transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong has gradually become more frequent, remittances between the two places have also been increasing daily, especially telegraphic transfers. The remittance fee has been reduced from 12% to 8%. The general market situation is more active than before, but due to the scarcity of materials, prices are still continuing to rise, and credit is also tighter than before. Several coastal salt farms in Guangdong Province have been completely destroyed due to the war. The salt authorities have decided to provide loans for relief so that they can continue production. After the harvest, the loans will be repaid with goods. Currently, salt farms in various places have been restored one after another. According to the authorities, the current salt production in coastal salt farms is very abundant. In addition to meeting the domestic food needs, one-third of the surplus can be transported abroad.</p>
<h3>General Sun Lianzhong Speaks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] General Sun Lianzhong granted this newspaper's reporter an exclusive interview today. According to him: (1) Hebei Province will still be established in Baoding. The provincial government is currently in Beiping as a matter of expediency. (2) Within the Hebei portion of the war zone, only 20,000 Japanese soldiers in Shijiazhuang and Cangxian have not yet surrendered; as for those who have surrendered and returned to their country, it is estimated that there are more than 29,000 people. Together with Japanese expatriates who have been repatriated, the total is more than 140,000 people. As for Japanese expatriates who have not yet been repatriated, it is planned to re-educate them in order to eradicate their aggressive thoughts and sow the seeds of peace in their minds. He is currently in consultation with representatives of the US Psychological Warfare Department on this matter. (3) The election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Provincial Assembly in Hebei Province is being prepared. According to the reporter's investigation, the original quota for representatives to the National Assembly in Hebei Province was 50, but it has now been changed to 60% for regional representatives and 40% for professional representatives, according to the previous plan of 43 regional representatives and 7 professional representatives.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone Moves to Zhengzhou, Under the Charge of Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The Eleventh War Zone, which originally governed northern Henan, has moved its command headquarters to Zhengzhou, under the charge of Liu Zhi, director of the Pacification Headquarters. Song Kenfan, the chief of staff who was not captured with Gao Ma last time, flew to Beiping from Xinxiang on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming Returns Home to Report on His Work; Dong Xian'guang Will Accompany Him Back to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to the United States, Wei Daoming, told a Central News Agency reporter that he is preparing to leave Washington on January 7th to return to Chongqing and is expected to arrive in Chongqing around the 15th. He met with US Secretary of State Byrnes today and will go to the White House to consult with President Truman before taking a car to the West Coast on the 7th. He will take off from San Francisco on January 10th, first to Shanghai, and then return to Chongqing. During Wei's return to his country, Tan Shaohua, Minister of the Embassy in the United States, will serve as chargé d'affaires. Dong Xian'guang will accompany Wei back to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming, who is about to return home to report on his work, met with Secretary of State Byrnes today, but Wei and the State Department did not comment on what was discussed. According to unconfirmed reports, Wei inquired with Byrnes about the extent to which the recent Moscow Tripartite Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the situation in China and wanted to know the latest US attitude towards the situation in China and what it hoped the National Government would do in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations.</p>
<h3>President Song Flies to Shanghai Today After Completing Inspections of Tianjin and Qingdao</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The industry of Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) will be reborn in the New Year. After President Song's iron-fisted clean-up of the Pingjin area, 163 factories have been re-received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Regarding the issue of resuming work, President Song adopted the approach of immediately resolving each case individually and never getting them mixed up in a muddy mess. Because most of the factories are in Tianjin, he brought all relevant departments to Tianjin to solve the problems together. The Supervisory Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Pingjin area, which is divided into mining, smelting, machinery, electrical engineering, papermaking, pharmaceutical, textile, acid-base, and other groups, will also set off in groups recently to uncover the seals of each factory and conduct practical inspections of the resumption of work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] President Song and his entourage left Tianjin by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane at 9:40 AM on the 6th and flew to Qingdao, where they were scheduled to stay for one day and fly to Shanghai on the 7th to return to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] President Song of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Councillors Xu Shizan, Secretaries Jiang Xiuping, Yi Zhongqiu, Zhou Yuemei, Engineer Guan Songsheng, Dalian Mayor Shen Yi, and many attendants, arrived in Qingdao at 11:25 AM today by CNAC special plane from Tianjin at 9:30 AM. They stayed at the Yingbing Hotel and immediately began to work. They also summoned Cheng Yiling, Deputy Director of the National Business Receiving Committee. After lunch, they met with Mayor Li Xianliang and others for talks. At 8:00 AM tomorrow, they will summon more than 30 people, including special envoys stationed in Qingdao from various Communist Party agencies and Mayor Li, Director Ge, and others for talks. At noon, they will attend a banquet hosted by Major General Harvey, Commander of the 6th Marine Division of the US Marine Corps, and leave Qingdao in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After arriving in Qingdao, President Song decided: (1) To organize a Review Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Shandong Qingdao area to review matters related to the processing of received enemy and puppet property, and appointed Peng Shinian and other eight people as members, with Cheng Yifa as the secretary-general. (2) In order to sell sealed enemy and puppet materials at par prices to stabilize commodity prices, a Qingdao Daily Necessities Par Price Committee was organized, with Peng Shinian appointed as the chairman and Song Xueting as the deputy chairman. He also ordered that coal be transported from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao before the end of the lunar year, and then continuously supplied from Qinhuangdao and Lianyungang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] During his two days in Tianjin, President Song repeatedly convened responsible personnel from various military and government departments in the city to discuss matters related to economic recovery and reception. It was decided: (1) To coordinate the supply of coal, gasoline, alcohol, and other fuels in the Hebei-Pingjin area, it was decided to establish a Fuel Management Committee for the Hebei-Pingjin area. The committee's address will be in Tianjin, and Sun Yueqi, Wang Chongzhi, Shi Zhiren, Wang Yichen, Ling Mianzhi, Wang Xijun, and Yu Jukui were appointed as members, with Sun Yueqi as the chairman and Wang Chongzhi as the deputy chairman. The headquarters of the Hebei Garrison and the Eleventh War Zone will each send one person as a member. (2) A large amount of flour will soon be transferred from abroad and Shanghai to Tianjin for sale at par prices to supply civilian food. Song summoned Tong Guanxian, Director of the Good Samaritan Relief Administration, Tan Boyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Director of the Executive Yuan's Resident Office in Ping, and Zhang Ting'e, Mayor of Tianjin, and others to discuss and decide to organize a committee to be responsible for the distribution and pricing of par-price flour. (3) President Song inquired about the resumption of work in various factories with great concern. After listening to reports from various departments, he has ordered the special commissioners of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to quickly formulate concrete measures for the resumption of work and the cooperation of small factories in order to be reviewed and implemented. (4) The Tianjin Municipal Police Department will be responsible for guarding the reception warehouses in the Tianjin-Tanggu area, and the Hebei Provincial Government will send local police to assist. (5) A branch of the Enemy Property Investigation Committee will be established in Tianjin to investigate and report on concealed enemy property. (6) President Song paid close attention to the various land reclamation agencies and their businesses that Japan originally had in North China and has telegraphed Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture to come to Pingjin for on-site inspection and to formulate methods for continued operation. (7) General Locker, commander of the US Marine Corps, and General Walton, chief of staff, accompanied by Deputy Mayor Du Jianshi, visited President Song on the morning of the 5th to request instructions on the US military's takeover of Japanese warehouses in Tianjin and their handover to our side for reception. President Song has sent Yu Weiye, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Shi Nansheng, director of the Tianjin Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau in the Hebei-Pingjin area, and others to receive them.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Leaves Moscow; Soviet Generals to Assist Us in Receiving Provincial Capitals in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 6th] Chiang Ching-kuo, the personal representative of Chairman Chiang, left Moscow on January 5th. The people who saw him off at the airport included Kerzhintsev, Director of the Treaty Department, Fu Bingchang, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and members of the Chinese Embassy.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] It seems that China and the Soviet Union are trying to negotiate several difficult issues in a good atmosphere. It is learned that President Song and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian discussed the Dalian reception issue and telegraphed the results of the discussion to Chiang Ching-kuo to negotiate with the Soviet side. According to Malinowski, Dalian is not within his defense zone, but belongs to the navy, so he cannot assist in the reception. The content of the telegram from Song and Shen to Chairman Chiang, as the reporter speculates, should be to ask him to inquire with the Soviet side about (1) the route for receiving Dalian, and (2) the An'dong reception issue. According to the reporter's investigation, the Northeast Headquarters recently sent a note to Malinowski, but the content is unknown. If Chairman Gao Xibing cannot obtain Soviet assistance to receive it like other chairmen, the reporter personally speculates that he may advance together with General Du Yuming's troops in the future. Regarding the issue of industry and mining, in addition to Xiong, Zhang, Chiang, and the top authorities in Chongqing and the diplomatic authorities, even the chairmen of the provinces have the regret of "丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦" (being completely baffled). Senior officials also believe that the Northeast industry and mining will be the first major event in the snow-covered Moscow negotiations. The plan for the large-scale airlift of National Army troops to the Northeast has been implicitly cancelled, but a part of the security team will still be airlifted there. This can be regarded as the most realistic annotation of Xiong Shihui's statement in Tianjin that the National Army will still be airlifted. Chairman Xiong once went to work to instruct the garrison on how to ensure the safety of the Beining Railway, which is the bridgehead for stepping into the Northeast, because Tangshan was once tense around New Year's Eve. Guan Jiyu, chairman of Songjiang, was originally scheduled to fly to his post on the 4th, but it was temporarily cancelled due to heavy snow in the Northeast and has been changed to today's departure. In addition to An'dong, the Soviet army will send liaison officers to assist in the reception of each provincial capital, but the widespread reception beyond the provincial capital is a major problem that will lie in front of the chairmen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Guan Jiyu, Chairman of Songjiang Province, and the Secretary-General and reception committee members flew here from Ping.</p>
<h3>National Army Arrives in the Suburbs of Shenyang</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] According to news received here, the National Army, which has been waiting for a long time to enter Shenyang, finally obtained Soviet approval today. However, on the condition that the National Army does not carry weapons into the city, several teams of National Army troops are now in the suburbs of Shenyang and are expected to enter the city at any time. Three Soviet liaison officers came to Tianjin from the Northeast yesterday and met with Chinese military officers here. The decision for the unarmed National Army to enter Shenyang was the result of recent repeated meetings. There have been no reports of conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the Shenyang area. Most observers say that if there are a small number of Communist troops in the city after the National Army takes over Shenyang, they will surrender to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] The National Army by land will soon be stationed in Shenyang. General Peng Bisheng led many members of his staff and arrived here from Xinmin tonight to contact the Soviet army and handle the establishment of camps.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 5th] It seems that the fact that General Du Yuming's large army will replace the Soviet army in Shenyang is about to become a reality. According to reports from the north, 5,000 people from Du's troops, who recently arrived via Huludao, are ready to advance at any time after the end of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. While General Du is waiting for orders to go to Shenyang, other activities in North China have also slowed down slightly, with small-scale harassment by Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Changchun, 6th] According to reports, the newly established "Special Security Regiment" is currently being airlifted from Beiping to Changchun. The regiment has a total of 4,000 members. Only 250 members flew to Changchun yesterday. It is expected that the same number of members will be transported there every day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] The first batch of National Army troops to fly here this afternoon were a part of the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Headquarters Security Team. They took ten giant planes. The first plane landed at 11:40 AM, and then a plane landed every three minutes. They were all wearing leather coats and hats and were fully armed. Although they were in a cold wind of minus 20 degrees, they were still in high spirits. On their way from the airport to the barracks, many people gathered on the roadside. Allied soldiers and Japanese expatriates also waved their hands to express their welcome in the crowd. The people of the Northeast have been waiting for the National Army to fly here for a long time. Now that they have witnessed the National Army descending from the sky, their joy cannot be described in words.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming and Others Inspect Fuxin National Army Taking Over Beipiao Chaoyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 5th] After the important town of Rehe, Fuxin, was taken over, Chief Du Yuming, accompanied by Chairman Liu Duoquan, braved the snow to inspect it on the 4th and made arrangements for its defense. Fuxin is a new city developed by the Japanese, and the project is only two-thirds completed. There are nine coal mines in total, and eight have already started operation. The city streets were damaged by the Communist army. Furthermore, Beipiao was completely taken over by the National Army at 1:00 PM on the 4th, and railway and telephone lines are being urgently repaired. The coal mine there is one of the important mineral resources in the Northeast. According to reports received by the Chief's Office, the power plant there has been destroyed, but it is expected to be repaired and operational in about two or three days. In addition, in recent days, citizen representatives from more than 20 counties including Zhangwu, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Liaozhong, and Tiecen have come to the Chief's Office in Jinzhou to pay their respects without prior agreement. They were all received and comforted by Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, who instructed them to return to their respective places to maintain order and await the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The National Army was ordered on the 3rd to take over Chaoyang. Due to heavy snow, it took two days to reach Chaoyang, entering the city at 9:00 AM on the 5th, and the takeover was completed by 5:00 PM. Army Commander Zhao Gongwu has personally gone to Chaoyang to oversee everything. It is reported that the Rehe Provincial Government will soon move there to conduct business.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sino-French Relations After the Biltin Incident</h3>
<p>The new French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, arrived in the wartime capital (Chongqing) by plane on the 5th of this month. After a short rest, he will surely meet with the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) to present his credentials. The Ambassador's arrival in Chongqing comes the day after the French warship "Biltin" illegally carried war criminals away from Shanghai. The situation arising from this incident has caused high dissatisfaction and anger among the Chinese people, casting a shadow over Sino-French relations. The new French Ambassador arrives in the wartime capital at this time, and the mission he bears to promote Sino-French relations is undoubtedly of great importance. We would like to take this opportunity to briefly look forward to Sino-French relations.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that in the effort to defeat the Japanese invaders, France did not shoulder the responsibility it should have, and on the contrary, in the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, France actively helped the Japanese invaders. However, in the post-war Pacific situation, we still believe that there is no conflict of interest with France, and even in northern Vietnam, China has replaced the United Nations in undertaking the task of accepting the surrender. Our Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that China has no territorial ambitions in Vietnam or even Southeast Asia. As such, Sino-French relations in the Pacific should be close, and in the current international situation, Sino-French relations should be even closer. But at this very moment, the Biltin incident occurred, which is truly an unfortunate event in Sino-French relations caused unilaterally by France.</p>
<p>Regarding the Biltin incident, there are at least two aspects to it: (1) the ship illegally carrying war criminals out of the country, and (2) the existence or abolition of French consular jurisdiction in China. Regarding the ship illegally carrying war criminals out of the country, this is a contempt for our national sovereignty and a violation of international practice. The French Consul-General in Shanghai failed to prevent it beforehand and failed to remedy it afterward, and the ship's captain and the French Consul in Shanghai should jointly bear the responsibility for damaging Sino-French relations. All the war criminals carried away by the ship should be immediately returned to Shanghai to await trial. At the same time, the ship's captain and the French Consul in Shanghai should apologize to our government authorities and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. Before this case is resolved, all French naval and land forces should not be allowed to enter China. These measures have already been protested by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the French government, and it is deeply believed that a resolution can be reached.</p>
<p>Another more serious issue arising from the Biltin incident is the existence or abolition of French consular jurisdiction in China. According to the protest lodged by the Shanghai Municipal Government with the French Consulate-General in Shanghai: The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Secretary Lu to the French Consulate-General in Shanghai to deliver the protest letter. The Consul-General replied verbally that the Consulate-General did indeed arrest a French Nazi, Caccopino, based on the consular jurisdiction stipulated in the old French treaty, and imprisoned him on the French warship and will send him back to his country in accordance with French law. It shows that the French Consulate-General in Shanghai not only openly admitted that France still enjoys extraterritorial rights in China based on the old treaty, but also unilaterally arrested criminals in our country. The latter is of course based on the former, but without the latter, the former is only an expression of will without action. The French Consul in Shanghai not only stated that France still enjoys consular jurisdiction in China, but has also unilaterally exercised this power. The importance of this is greater than the Biltin's unauthorized departure from Shanghai with war criminals.</p>
<p>Although the new Sino-French treaty is still awaiting signature, the old treaty has long been abolished in law and in fact and no longer exists. Since Paris was captured by the Nazis and the Vichy government acted perversely, our country not only withdrew its embassies and consulates in France, but in fact severed diplomatic relations with France. The establishment of the Vichy government made France a vassal of Hitler. Although General de Gaulle struggled hard abroad, at that time there was still no organization like the National Liberation Committee established in North Africa that could represent the interests of France and be generally recognized by the international community. Due to the establishment of the Vichy government and the failure of the new government to emerge, France was unable to fulfill its international obligations, and the old Sino-French treaty and the old Sino-Portuguese treaty have naturally been abolished in law with the collapse of France itself. As for the French concession areas attached to the old Sino-French treaty, they no longer exist, and the French government has long been aware of this. Just look at the fact that there is no longer the shameful term "French Concession" in Shanghai today, and it is clear. However, today, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, on the one hand, publicly recognizes that the "French Concession" has long been abolished, but on the other hand, says that the arrest of criminals is based on the old treaty, which is a truly absurd act, leaving a stain on Sino-French relations after the war!</p>
<p>We feel even more regrettable that some French expatriates are still unaware of the new international situation and are filled with past superiority and outdated concepts. In World War II, France not only failed to fulfill its due obligations, but in a sense, even condoned and even supported Japanese aggression. They should be thinking about how to correct past mistakes and wash away their shame. To put it bluntly, their traditional sense of superiority and outdated concepts are no longer in line with the new situation after World War II! The occurrence of this Biltin incident, to put it more seriously, the Chinese people have the right to demand that our government declare a break in diplomatic relations with France before a legal solution is obtained. Because we believe that this is not just the Biltin incident, but a test of other countries encroaching on China's sovereignty after the war. We must resolutely prevent these attempts from succeeding.</p>
<p>The new French Ambassador has been in China for many years. This time he has come to China from post-war Europe, which is appropriate when there is a shadow over Sino-French relations. With the Ambassador's talents, we firmly believe that he will be able to quickly clear these shadows and make Sino-French relations more and more intimate. China and France need to cooperate in the Pacific and in the reconstruction of the world situation; China can help France, and France can also help China. We must not allow the mistakes of the Captain of the Biltin and the French Consul-General in Shanghai to become a factor in damaging the friendly relations between China and France.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday, Will Remove Aggressors, List of Dismissed Cabinet Members Sent to MacArthur for Review</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, 6th, midnight broadcast: This morning at 10:00 AM, the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency meeting that lasted a long time, ending at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The central discussion was on how to implement the order issued by MacArthur, and the issue of the formation of the cabinet members was also mentioned. According to the order, Japanese officials who attempted to conquer the world are prohibited from participating in administrative work. The cabinet meeting convened this morning was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, but was postponed to this morning because three cabinet members were not in Tokyo. Although the results of the discussion this morning have not been announced, the Japanese government has begun to draft a list of ministers who will be removed and submit it to MacArthur for review. It is scheduled to be announced after the cabinet meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to Secretary-General of the Cabinet Tsuda, the cabinet may only be reorganized, or the entire cabinet may resign, depending on the opinion of Prime Minister Shidehara. Shidehara believes that it is not yet time to decide. Sources said that Shidehara may reorganize the cabinet, but not resign en masse, or ask the Supreme Commander to allow his cabinet members to remain in office temporarily, because the directive stipulates that key personnel may remain in office temporarily. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Deputy Secretary-General Mikami said that Foreign Minister Yoshida will probably go to the Supreme Command to learn the details of the directive and request MacArthur to allow all Japanese cabinet members to remain in office temporarily until after the general election. The date of the general election has not yet been determined, but the Supreme Command said that it has not received a request to meet with MacArthur. Since the arrival of US Secretary of War Patterson in Japan, the Supreme Command has been extremely busy. To implement MacArthur's directive, the Japanese government has prepared two laws, which are quite complicated and are an emergency way to implement the conditions set by the Potsdam Declaration. Some Japanese newspapers believe that according to MacArthur's directive, only Shidehara and Yoshida among the Japanese cabinet members are not tainted by aggression.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese government has today drafted laws to remove all officials who led Japan in the war. This is the first concrete result of MacArthur's directive to eliminate aggressors. According to a cabinet spokesman: This law will be submitted to the cabinet meeting on Monday. The Asahi Shimbun's new editorial said: Prime Minister Shidehara and his cabinet may resign en masse because of this new directive. It seems that the political parties are also bound to collapse, because most of the candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections are wartime dregs.</p>
<h3>Whether All Japanese Cabinet Members Will Resign En Masse Will Be Revealed Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to a Japanese spokesman: The Japanese cabinet will not resign. It is expected that the cabinet will continue to hold a cabinet meeting tonight to discuss the urgent question of whether MacArthur's new order will force the entire cabinet to resign, or whether some cabinet members will be forced to resign. Prime Minister Shidehara was unable to attend the morning cabinet meeting due to a cold, and Foreign Minister Yoshida also did not attend. At the cabinet meeting, MacArthur ordered that all officials who led the Japanese people in the war should be removed. The cabinet meeting began to discuss how to implement this order. When the Associated Press reporter asked Horikiri, who attended the cabinet meeting, he smiled and shook his head, saying he did not know. According to well-informed Japanese sources, no matter what the fate of the cabinet, Interior Minister Horikiri may be forced to resign. Foreign Minister Yoshida met with Shidehara yesterday and then met with the Emperor to discuss MacArthur's new order. It is said that MacArthur's new order has raised the issue of the existence of the Japanese House of Peers. Twenty-eight members of the House of Peers have been arrested as suspected war criminals, fifteen of whom have already submitted their resignations voluntarily. It is speculated by the Japanese that another fifteen will be forced to resign. The House of Peers has a total of 412 members.</p>
<h3>At Least Six Japanese Cabinet Members Will Be Removed, Including the Minister of Interior, Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Education</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] The Shidehara Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning to discuss MacArthur's directive to eliminate all militarists. It is said that the Japanese cabinet members who need to be removed first are: Interior Minister Horikiri (former director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association), Cabinet Secretary-General and Minister without Portfolio Tsuda, Agriculture Minister Matsumura, and Education Minister Maeda, among others. The most well-informed sources said that Shidehara may maintain the current cabinet and only dismiss these cabinet members and replace them with new people. However, the Social Democratic Party demanded that the Shidehara Cabinet resign en masse. The Asahi Shimbun's editorial today also said that the Shidehara Cabinet is mediocre and incompetent, cannot be responsible, and should step down.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, 6th, midnight broadcast: Today, all newspapers in Tokyo unanimously believe that MacArthur's new directive will give Japan new leadership. The Mainichi Shimbun commented: "Our past reforms have all been superficial." The Asahi Shimbun pointed out that MacArthur's new order is "a further step in building a new Japan."</p>
<h3>US State Department Official Talks About MacArthur's Authority: He May Have the Power to Appoint a New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] State Department officials said today that if the Shidehara cabinet falls due to MacArthur's directive to eliminate militarists from the Japanese government, it is believed that MacArthur may have the power to appoint a new cabinet. The communiqué of the Moscow Conference of Three Foreign Ministers had reserved the power to appoint a new Japanese cabinet to the Four-Power Control Committee, but State Department officials pointed out that Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters on Thursday that the communiqué contained a clause empowering MacArthur to supplement the vacant cabinet members, so the regulations of the communiqué have greatly reduced its effectiveness. When a reporter asked whether the committee only had the right to appoint Shidehara's successor, the State Department official replied: "According to the directive, MacArthur may appoint people to continue to maintain the current cabinet." Observers said that even if the entire cabinet resigns, MacArthur can appoint one person today and another tomorrow, supplementing the vacancies entirely on an individual basis. The State Department also said that it has not received any consultation from the Soviet Union regarding the current Japanese cabinet crisis.</p>

<h3>I Believe Our Exports to the US Can Easily Recover to Pre-War Levels; Various Obstacles Urgently Need to Be Overcome</h3>
<p>[San Francisco, US Information Service, 6th] Collier, Chairman of the San Francisco Bay Area Branch of the China-America Business Association, reported in the December issue of "Argonaut" magazine: According to Chinese official estimates, a large number of exports will be shipped to the United States in the coming years. Collier said that estimates show that after the transitional period of reviving production and transportation in the formerly occupied areas, China will ship more basic exports than before the 1937 war. However, Collier pointed out in the report that although there are many optimistic signs from China, there are still many obstacles to overcome before Chinese export trade reaches pre-war levels. Collier continued in the report that it is generally expected that China's future expanded export trade will be operated by private enterprises, but Chinese authorities say that the Commodity Inspection Bureau established by the government will continue to work to improve the quality of major exports. China's main products are tung oil, bristles, raw silk, wool, tea, eggs, and [blanks]. Other Chinese export products expected to be exported in large quantities are casings, leather, oilseeds, soybeans, feathers, medicines, hemp, jute and ramie, and tungsten ore. Some finished products that had a large market overseas before the war can also occupy an important position in exports after the war, especially items such as handkerchiefs, linen, embroidery, lace, and hairnets. During the period from 1935 to 1937, the United States did not receive many exports from China. Chinese authorities believe that in the post-war period, Chinese exports to the United States will increase significantly. Collier said that obstacles that must be overcome before reopening trade relations include the stability of China's currency system and the establishment of a reasonable exchange rate for the US dollar. Another obstacle is the lack of domestic and international transportation in China.</p>

<h3>Private Primary and Secondary Schools Held a Symposium Yesterday</h3>
<p>Key Points Roughly Divided into Six Aspects</p>
<p>[City Report] Private primary and secondary schools in the first and second school districts of this city held a symposium at Lake Society yesterday morning. About 40 schools, including Nanyang Middle School, Daguang Primary and Secondary School, Minsheng Primary and Secondary School, Boren Middle School, Chongshi Elementary School, and Minghui Elementary School, attended. The main points of the discussion were roughly divided into six aspects: (1) The starting dates of each school this semester varied, so the holiday dates also varied slightly, roughly from January 20 to 25. (2) The official starting date for the next semester is February 22. (3) The tuition fee is tentatively set at 12,000 yuan for elementary schools, 16,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 20,000 yuan for senior high schools. (4) Teachers' salaries are allocated at 70% of the total tuition income of the school. (5) Most schools in this city do not have sports fields. It is proposed to ask the municipal government to convert the racecourse and other open spaces in the downtown area of ​​this city into public sports fields as much as possible to improve the health of students in the city. (6) The tuition fees for private schools this semester are low and teachers' salaries are meager, which has led to most teachers abandoning their jobs halfway, causing great distress. However, if the tuition fees are too high, parents cannot afford them, and if the tuition fees are low, it is impossible to hire teachers. As for the board of directors of private schools in this city, there are actually very few who can bear economic responsibility. For the sake of education for most students in the city, specific methods should be proposed and the authorities should be requested to maintain it.</p>

<h3>Basketball Charity Match Closes: South China Loses to Signal Team by One Point; US Air Force Beats Hua Lian with Strength; Xu Wenxiang Buys Charity Ball for 150,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The basketball charity event sponsored by the Municipal Sports Association was on its second night yesterday. The audience in the Municipal Gymnasium was quite crowded. All proceeds were used for educational loans. The ticket revenue was 180,900 yuan. At the beginning of the second game, Director Gu of the Education Bureau performed the opening ball ceremony. After the game, the charity ball was auctioned off, and Mr. Xu Wenxiang won it for 150,000 yuan. The two games are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>South China and the US Signal Team played against each other first. South China cautiously responded to the battle. He Jingui and Li Ruixiong were extremely active, and Li Xianzheng was the most hardworking. In the first half, South China won by one point with a score of 14 to 12. In the second half, South China made a concerted effort and scored five points in an instant, taking an absolute advantage. The US military counterattacked, and Shi Qiebie Overland and others made all their shots, forming a seesaw situation again. With only three seconds remaining at 26 to 25, He Jingui fouled, and Overlan made both free throws. South China finally suffered a defeat by a one-point difference, with a score of 26 to 27.</p>
<p>In the second game, Hua Lian played against the Jiangwan Team. Hua Lian intended to use guerrilla warfare yesterday and did not use its best lineup on the field, which resulted in a pursuit situation. In the first half, the Jiangwan team won by four points with a score of 16 to 12. In the second half, Hua Lian reorganized its lineup, and Zhen Zhongbo came off the field. Zhen Zhong and Xue Chong each scored a goal, tying the score, with hope of a turning point. The audience cheered continuously. Hua Lian was eager to win, and was too hasty, frequently missing good opportunities. The Jiangwan team took the opportunity to enter, and Hua Lian lost by a score of 25 to 30.</p>
<h3>Qingbai Has an Unfavorable Start</h3>
<p>Lost to the Jewish Team by Two to One: Poor Communication is the Fatal Wound</p>
<p>Yesterday the weather was clear and sunny. It was a holiday, and in the Jiaoyuan Group A football match, Qingbai, a rising new force of Chinese, played against the Jewish team. Qingbai's first oath attracted the attention of football fans, and Changping Road was crowded with fans, which was a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The match started at 2:30 pm. The Jewish team originally planned to invite the Italian players McNitti and Boqi, both of whom had brought their football shoes, but they did not appear on the field in the end. It was heard that the Italian Overseas Chinese Authority opposed it. As a result, the two Italian generals did not appear on the field, and the entire Jewish team responded to the battle. Everyone thought that Qingbai could take advantage of this good opportunity and capture the Jewish team in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, the result was so tragic that they lost by one to two, which made thousands of fans sigh in unison.</p>
<p>In the first half, Li Shuoyou scored the first goal, but was soon retaliated by Wen Tuo, making it a 1-1 draw. In the second half, Mai Lexi scored a goal, making it 2-1. Qingbai tried its best to counterattack, but it was unable to recover, and as a result, it lost to the Jewish team by 2-1. The scattered and unregulated forwards of Qingbai, losing contact, were the main cause of the failure.</p>
<p>Jewish Team:</p>
<p>Cohen, Mania, Leibai Ge, Lao Shi, Mai Lexi, Tang Naixu, Stane, Kapu Siding, Wen Tuo, Lai Liao, Li Fan</p>
<p>Qingbai Team:</p>
<p>Huang Shijie, Yan Shixin, Zhuang Wenquan, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Wu Qixiang, Li Shuoyou, Luo Shoufu, Gao Xiuqing (out), Gu Yice (in), Wu Binghao (up)</p>

<h3>French Warship Transports War Criminals from Shanghai; Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Protest; French Consul General Hopes to Maintain Sino-French Friendship</h3>
<p>Chen Guolian, Director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, who was in Beijing on official business, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after receiving a report that the French warship *Bélier* had illegally transported French war criminals away from Shanghai. He will personally oversee all negotiations related to this case. Yesterday, Mr. Chen summoned Secretary Lü and other key officials to consult in detail about the initial negotiations in this case. It is understood that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has directly lodged a protest with the French government. Before receiving instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, no new measures will be taken for the time being by the Shanghai Office.</p>
<p>French Consul General in Shanghai, M. Ferey, to clarify his position on the *Bélier*'s transporting the French traitor Cacopino from Shanghai to Saigon, received reporters twice yesterday and made a statement. He said: "The *Bélier* incident has been reported in newspapers several times recently. This is essentially a local matter, and we deeply believe that the Chinese and French governments will definitely find a satisfactory solution in the near future. I hope that the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Mr. Meyrier, who recently arrived in Chongqing, will take positive measures to promote Sino-French relations. Mr. Meyrier is a good friend of China and will surely promote Sino-French friendship in the shortest possible time. As for myself, I am constantly working to strengthen the traditional friendship between China and France in Shanghai."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] French Consul General Ferey stated yesterday that the *Bélier*'s illegal departure was a local matter. However, diplomatic circles yesterday solemnly stated that they believe this demonstrates the French side's failure to respect our national sovereignty. Not only should the French Consul General bear full responsibility, but the French government should also bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>French Consul General's Actions Are Illegal</p>
<p>Regarding the French warship *Bélier* disregarding our country's protests and transporting the war criminal Cacopino from Shanghai to Saigon, all sectors of the city are paying close attention. Our reporter specially interviewed a leading figure in Shanghai's diplomatic community who is not currently in office, to inquire about his views on the case. He said: The French Consul General's handling of this case is clearly inappropriate. According to international law, although the treaty abolishing consular jurisdiction between China and France has not been formally ratified, the draft was signed by both countries long ago. Moreover, on May 19, 1943, the Chinese government informed the French Chargé d'Affaires, declaring that all consular jurisdiction and other privileges obtained by France under unequal treaties were abolished. In December 1945, the French Chargé d'Affaires informed the Chinese government that all French consular courts had ceased hearing cases. Based on the above, the French consulate police's arrest of the French war criminal Cacopino was illegal. Furthermore, our municipal government and the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office had already lodged verbal and written protests after the arrest of the suspect. However, the French Consul General ignored our protests and privately escorted the suspect away from Shanghai on a French warship. This action is a contempt for our national sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Case Is Serious and Must Be Vigorously Pursued</p>
<p>The Consul claimed in his conversation with reporters that he had only arrived in Shanghai from Paris a month and a half ago and was unfamiliar with handling this matter. This explanation is an attempt to shirk responsibility and has no basis in international law. The Consul General also stated that he had not received any notification from the French government regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction or the handling of French war criminals. This statement is even more of an excuse, as the French Chargé d'Affaires stated in his communication to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the suspension of consular court hearings had been notified to all French consulates in China. How could the French Consul in Shanghai not have received notification from the French Embassy? The diplomat continued, "This illegal arrest and private transport of a criminal seems to be a planned action. The French Consul General deliberately damaged Chinese sovereignty and created a *fait accompli* in order to gain a diplomatic precedent, attempting to continue to use it in the future." The diplomat further emphasized to the reporter: "If our government does not take a tough stance and seek effective solutions in this case, all countries may use this case as a precedent, rendering the various treaties abolishing consular jurisdiction meaningless. The gravity of this case is enough to warrant the close attention of our government and the public."</p>
<p>Chinese Courts Have the Right to Sanction</p>
<p>The diplomat added that the French Consul General is a commercial official, not a diplomat. Therefore, for his illegal actions, he should bear all the responsibilities stipulated by Chinese law and be subject to Chinese law and court decisions. The existence of the French Consulate General's police force is illegal, and Chinese military police should be able to legally restrain them. Before the case is resolved, the Chinese government should be able to legally suspend all activities of the French Consulate General and prohibit French merchant ships and warships from entering Chinese ports.</p>
<h3>Ming Dynasty Bronze Censer Gifted to Allied Forces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, to comfort the Allied forces, has sent letters to various trade associations, requesting small donations of commemorative items to present to the Allies as a token of appreciation.

<h3>Jiangsu Natives in Shanghai Concerned About Senatorial Candidates</h3>

Several meetings have been held by Jiangsu politicians, party cadres, elders, and prominent figures to discuss this matter. Wang Genzhong and Wang Baoxuan have been designated to liaise with all parties to achieve a unified position and make recommendations to the Standing Committee.</p>
<h3>General Manager of Sincere Company, Li Ze, Held Puppet Positions; Employees Report Him to Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The staff of the Sincere Company have publicly reported the crimes of the company's General Manager Li Ze for collaborating with the enemy, attracting close attention from the citizens of Shanghai. Our reporter has inquired from all parties and compiled the following report:</p>
<p>Held Puppet Positions During the Occupation</p>
<p>Li Ze, also known as Ruotao, is a native of Shiqi, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and is 51 years old. After Shanghai fell, Li served as a "Director of the Puppet National Commercial Control Association," a "Special Commissioner of the Puppet Sixteen Commodities Evaluation Committee," a "Chairman of the Puppet Enemy Property Committee," and heavily invested in the puppet Jiangnan Shipyard. He even donated 20,000 catties of all the water pipes and iron from Sincere Company to the enemy.</p>
<p>Sold Enemy Goods Before the Incident</p>
<p>Before the Incident, the company's business was not very prosperous. Li Ze went to Japan to order large quantities of wool and other goods, hoping to obtain even greater profits. He used the enemy's protection to evade customs duties, change labels, and falsely claim that the goods were products of European and American countries for sale. This was exposed by enthusiastic anti-Japanese elements, causing a great uproar in society at the time.</p>
<p>Police Summons Refused</p>
<p>Now that victory has been achieved, Shu Yueqiao and others, former waiters at the New Capital Hotel attached to the company, have filed a report. Although Li Ze has been summoned by the police, he still refuses to appear. Yesterday, as it was a Sunday, the company was closed as usual, but the windows and surrounding walls were covered with newspapers reporting Li Ze's accusations, marked in red ink. Passersby gathered to watch, blocking the road.</p>
<h3>High Court Criminal Division to Try Three Traitors Today</h3>

At 2:00 PM, the sentencing date for Zhou Yi will be announced.</p>
<h3>Vacant Houses Left by Japanese Residents to Be Distributed in a Unified Manner</h3>
<p>Japanese residents in the city have continued to be repatriated over the past month. The vacant houses left by them will be distributed in a unified manner by the responsible authorities. However, disputes are inevitable. Before the Japanese residents withdrew, or during the period when the houses were sealed by the authorities, some owners rented them out privately without applying for their return. Regarding these disputes, our reporter inquired with relevant authorities yesterday. They stated that if the houses occupied by Japanese residents are not enemy or puppet properties, the lease rights of the houses should belong to the Japanese residents. After the Japanese residents are ordered to concentrate or be repatriated, the continuing lease rights of the vacant houses should belong to the receiving agency. The owners should wait for the Standing Committee to make unified distribution arrangements and should not use excuses to obstruct and cause difficulties for the tenants, leading to disputes, unless they are indeed being taken back for their own use.</p>
<h3>Workers' Severance Pay from Enemy Factories Passes Five Hundred Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is learned that the workers' severance pay from Japanese-owned factories in the city has been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee. The total amount is more than 58,720,000 yuan, covering 144 units. Each worker will receive a reasonable amount when distributed in the future.</p>
<h3>Medicines and Medical Supplies from Enemy Factories Widely Supplied; First Supply Center Established Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to rationally supply medicines and medical supplies and reduce the burden on patients, has been cleaning up the medicines and medical supplies stored in the factories taken over from the enemy. Now that the work has been completed, the First Supply Center has been established to widely supply the needs of citizens. The Supply Center is scheduled to be officially established today.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Transfers Medical Supplies</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Headquarters reported yesterday that the U.S. Army Medical Corps transferred medicines and hospital equipment to the Shanghai Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), providing great assistance to the sick here. The medicines transferred by the U.S. military to UNRRA in November last year were as follows: (1) Medicines and hospital equipment worth 500,000 US dollars, including two iron lungs; (2) 2,150 hospital beds (distributed to three American hospitals); (3) Medicines including vitamin pills, penicillin, glucose, and anesthetics. Before arriving in Shanghai, the U.S. military dropped various medicines near concentration camps by plane for use by people in the camps. Afterwards, the quantity of medicines transferred to UNRRA was very large. The Director of the Supply Department of the U.S. Army Medical Corps said that penicillin has the greatest use in China today, but these medicines are for relief purposes only and are strictly prohibited from being traded on the black market. Once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Relief Administration Sets Up Hospitals</p>
<p>In order to promote health facilities, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is planning to establish 660 hospitals in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Changchun, and other places in the near future. All of the above hospitals will have free beds, and 400 foreign doctors will soon come to China to implement training programs.</p>
<h3>Build a Tomb of Unknown Heroes to Commemorate Anti-Japanese War Soldiers</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city plan to build a permanent memorial to commemorate the soldiers and compatriots who died in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. It is now learned that the principle has been decided to build a "Tomb of Unknown Heroes." The construction site is also located in the park on Fuxing Middle Road (formerly the French Garden). However, the construction funds and style are still under study and discussion. It is learned that various agencies and public organizations will hold regular meetings to discuss implementation methods.</p>
<h3>Association of Comrades Who Suffered Calamities Continues to Issue the Third Batch of Medals of Honor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Comrades Who Suffered Calamities in the Anti-Japanese War has issued commemorative medals of honor twice. It is learned that the sixth meeting of the standing directors of the association reviewed and approved the list of those who should receive the medal of honor, totaling 81 people.</p>
<h3>Xuan Tiewu Sets a Deadline to Solve Theft Cases</h3>
<p>Since winter began, theft cases have occurred repeatedly in the city. Police Chief Xuan Tiewu is very concerned about this and, in addition to strictly ordering his subordinates to step up security, has issued an order to all 30+ police stations to find ways to solve the theft cases within ten days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Management Bureau to Sell Large Quantities of Materials at Reduced Prices, Including Five Items: Sugar, Oil, Coal, Cloth, and Soap</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Lunar New Year is approaching, and Chinese people traditionally purchase large quantities of daily necessities at this time. In order to prevent price fluctuations caused by this, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has decided to sell various materials at reduced prices in the near future. The items include: (1) 700 tons of sugar, which has already started selling; (2) 200,000 bolts of cloth, which will be distributed to the market by the China Textile Construction Company; (3) Edible oil; (4) Soap; (5) Coal. The quantities of the last three items have not yet been determined and will be adjusted according to market needs. In the future, whenever prices tend to rise, the Bureau will use rapid means to sell materials at reduced prices, so as to stabilize the city's prices in the long term.</p>
<p>Selling Flour at Low Prices to Prevent Speculation</p>
<p>Since the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration began selling flour to retailers at reduced prices, it has been done three times. However, because the selling price is too low, hoarders and speculators can easily take the opportunity to purchase in false names, attempting to manipulate the market. Therefore, since the start of the third phase of sales on the 4th, no new registrations have been accepted. Only cake stalls and noodle shops that have already registered and passed the review are eligible for distribution.</p>
<p>Fishing Boats Sent Out to Sea to Catch Fish Return to Shanghai</p>

It is reported that the Huajiao No. 1 and No. 2 fishing boats returned to Shanghai at the end of last month, catching more than 70,000 catties of fish. The Hua Textile No. 1 and No. 2 fishing boats returned to Shanghai on the 4th of this month, catching 80,000 catties of fish. The two trips together yielded more than 14 million yuan.</p>

The ship was fully loaded with passengers and goods to Chongqing, to be transferred to Chongqing in Yichang.

However, the company stated that the tonnage capacity was full and no additional cargo could be loaded. The company is willing to give priority to loading these returned goods on the next trip.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Vehicle Accidents Have Been Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The U.S. Army Headquarters issued a statement yesterday stating that a total of 22 U.S. military vehicle accidents occurred in November last year. In December last year, the number had been reduced to 18. Since the 6th of this year, no major injury cases have occurred.

<h3>Robbers Actually Take Public Reserve Funds When Dividing Loot; Police Search Hotels and Finally Face the Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Zhi, a native of Nanjing whose original profession was printing, committed robbery during the occupation and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was later released under the puppet government's "amnesty." However, his thieving nature remained unchanged, and he joined forces with four "intellectual youths," Zheng Yafen, Zhou Wenhai, Xia Yiping, and Jiang Hailin. They repeatedly robbed seven locations: No. 15 Liuying Village on Datong Road, No. 7 Jinyu Lane on Zhongzheng Road, No. 166 Runkang Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, No. 315 Tongfu Road, No. 4 Guifu Lane on Shunchang Road, No. 15, Lane 27 Yunnan Road, and No. 166 Jinxiang Lane on Shanhai Pass Road and Chibang Road. The total value of the gold and jewelry robbed was 20 million yuan in legal tender. Each robbery was meticulously planned and well-arranged, so the case was never solved. The method of dividing the loot was also extremely fair, and a public reserve fund was set aside for daily expenses, lodging, and meals. Finally, because the funds obtained from the robbery had been used up, they were planning to carry out another robbery in the Dadongnan Hotel on West Xinqiao Street when the police team searched the room. Unable to escape, four handguns were found and confiscated at the scene, and they were taken to the bureau for questioning. They confessed to robbing the above-mentioned locations. They were immediately transferred to the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. After several interrogations, all the victims were summoned and the evidence was confirmed. The entire case was investigated and completed on the 5th, and each was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Guests Suddenly Come to Cause Trouble; Shooting and Wounding Neighbors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 5:05 PM yesterday at No. 9, Lane 288, Yuezhou Road, Hudong Tianhouli, a man wearing a blue cloth gown suddenly broke in and asked if Cai Amao was at home. The second landlord, surnamed Chen, replied that there was no such person here and told him that he was in the attic of No. 17 across the street. The man then went to that location. At that time, Cai was busy preparing medicine with his wife, Chen, because one of his sons had a severe case of measles. He suddenly heard someone calling and was about to step out of the door when the visitor had already gone upstairs. Before they could exchange words, he began punching him indiscriminately, from the third floor to the lower floor. Cai could not resist and shouted for help. The man then ran out of the back door. Cai followed closely, chasing him to the center of the lane. Qian Xiaolong, a resident of No. 7 (30 years old, working at a pig shop on Fair Road), was returning from outside and saw Cai chasing a man madly. Suspecting that he was a bandit, he bravely stepped forward and hugged him around the waist. Unexpectedly, the man pulled out a handgun from his side and fired a shot, hitting him in the right side of his face. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The perpetrator, seeing that he had caused a serious disaster, ran out of the lane. The people in the lane chased closely, reaching Gaoyang Road, the perpetrator flashed into a small lane, went to Rue Auguste Boppe, and fired several shots as a warning. In the end, he took off his shoes and fled over the wall. Zhang Xiaolong, who had been injured, was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment by ambulance after being summoned by the police. Afterwards, the reporter visited Cai's residence. According to his wife, Chen, Cai was a foreign coppersmith and is currently unemployed, making a living as a peddler. He has four children, making life difficult. When asked if this person came to discuss something, she replied that she did not know him. As for the rumors that the case involved a love affair, it was not true, or it may be related to a feud. It is learned that the suspect's name is Wang Shen, and the Tilanqiao Branch is currently investigating.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Fluctuations in Gold and Banknotes Were Slight; Yarn, Cotton, Silk Fabric, and Coal All Rose</h3>
<p>Finance: Last week, Shanghai's financial market saw booming Chinese and foreign stocks due to the year-end holidays. Bill turnover was frequent. Interbank lending rates remained stable at three jiao, while shadow interest rates hovered around the one jiao mark. In December, a substantial amount of legal tender funds flowed into Shanghai from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to two phenomena: (1) an increasing number of people seeking high-interest loans, and (2) surplus funds rushing into the Chinese and foreign stock markets, as well as the cotton yarn and cloth markets. Due to the postponement of raising gold prices, coupled with the gradual convergence of gold prices between Chongqing and Shanghai, and the non-disclosure of exchange rates, major paper dealers and speculators sold, causing prices to fluctuate minimally between 770,000 yuan and 813,000 yuan. Trading was sluggish, and the week closed at 797,000 yuan, down 16,000 yuan from the previous week. Regarding U.S. dollars, with the exchange rate against Taiwan fixed at 37 yuan, the indirect exchange rate in Shanghai was only 1,111.5 yuan. Some importers' refusal to accept U.S. dollars initially caused a drop of 40 to 50 yuan due to selling pressure. However, yarn factories and daily necessities manufacturers bought in when prices fell, using them to procure imported raw materials, bringing the price back to 1,405 yuan at the close, down 25 yuan from the previous week. Foreign news reported that a U.S. cotton loan of 33 million yuan has been established, allowing the purchase of 275,000 to 300,000 bales of cotton, each weighing 500 pounds, equivalent to 1.23 million to 1.35 million dan in our country's market. For the next year, the textile industry will no longer need to search for U.S. dollars and foreign exchange. Hong Kong currency, both old and new, experienced an oversupply among money exchangers, leading to a drop of 10 yuan for old currency and a weakening of 1 yuan for new currency.</p>
<p>Securities: Due to the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists and the airlift of Chinese troops to Changchun, Class C unified bonds reached a peak of 900 yuan. The other classes, D and E, were also more popular than A and B. Considering the longer repayment period and the inscription of "repayment of principal in national currency," Class E was even more promising than Class C. In general, speculation dominated the bond market. The massive 900 billion legal tender issued during the war will need to be reorganized after the war. The potential adoption of a new currency is a factor driving the bullish outlook for unified bonds. Although the ban on trading Chinese stocks has not been lifted, over 400 securities association members have registered. Furthermore, the cotton and silk weaving industries are performing exceptionally well, leading to a shortage of circulating shares of yarn and silk factories. Gold merchants, Guangdong businessmen, and a Mr. Wang from the paper industry bought in, particularly focusing on the popular Wing On Textile Factory stock, which suddenly reached a peak of 1,000 yuan and closed at 980 yuan, up 160 yuan from the previous week. Large cultural stocks, such as the Commercial Press with a par value of 100 yuan, were traded at 40,000 yuan. Foreign stocks experienced a surge due to the resumption of operations by foreign factories and firms, and the acceptance of shareholder transfer procedures with official seals. Foreigners and major speculators from Guangdong aggressively purchased Jardine Matheson, HSBC, and Union Insurance, leading to a surge of 800 to 1,800 yuan from the previous week. HSBC, which owns the most magnificent building on Zhongzheng Road, closed at a new high price of 7,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Commodities: Regarding goods, an average of 15,000 dan of rice arrived daily. The city authorities are also ordering Siamese rice, keeping prices stable and weak. Flour prices are firm due to the high price of 9,000 yuan per bag in Tianjin, resulting in increased shipments from the north. The Xinghua and Quanzhou gangs bought soybeans, while Taiwan, Shantou, and Xiamen gangs actively purchased soybean cakes. Each cake, weighing 50 jin, reached a high of 2,075 yuan. Cottonseed cake, used as fuel by factories, reached a high of 2,150 yuan. Vegetable oil and sugar prices were slightly lower due to the planned sale of subsidized vegetable oil and sugar. However, in inland areas such as Changzhou, oil prices were higher than in Shanghai due to a shortage of soybean raw materials. Cotton yarn prices initially rose due to purchases of 20-count yarn by Shantou, Xiamen, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. Subsequently, prices surged further due to increased demand for Double Horse 20-count yarn from Hong Kong and Guangdong, reaching a new high of 850,000 yuan. Since the puppet cotton control association purchased all cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai in 1943, the supply of yarn in Shanghai has been scarce, especially for renowned old brands, which are particularly difficult to find. Customer gangs exploited this weakness and accumulated stocks. As a result, while rice prices have risen 700 times compared to before the war, yarn prices have risen 3,400 times. Cotton cloth prices also rose, with Sichuanese merchants purchasing Shilin-colored cloth and dyeing factories aggressively buying white cotton fabric. Dragon Head 12-pound cloth reached a new high price of 36,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton factories and cotton brokers aggressively accumulated stocks, pushing the price of Nantong American cotton to a high of 87,000 yuan per dan, more than doubling the low point in mid-December. Raw silk exports to foreign firms were strong, rising by 100,000 yuan. Artificial silk factories absorbed supplies, leading to an increase of 45,000 yuan. Silk fabrics were mediocre, while knitted goods followed the yarn market upward. Chinese cigarette factories were distributing goods, while British and American cigarettes weakened along with Chinese cigarettes. Fuel prices rose due to winter demand and low inventories, with white coal chunks rising by 40,000 yuan per ton, and firewood coal balls rising by 100 to 200 yuan each. Matches remained firm, while Western soap and candles saw a slight drop due to reduced orders from Sichuanese merchants. (Zhong Bo)</p>
<h3>Exporters Eager for Early Determination of Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The new exchange rate remains uncertain, causing considerable anxiety among export merchants. According to a certain exporter: China's major export commodities are still tea, tung oil, pig bristles, raw silk, and wool. Before the war, China's tea production accounted for 45% of the world's total, with an annual output of approximately 900 million pounds and exports of over 219,700 metric tons. Tung oil accounted for over 94% of the world's output, with Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, as well as western Hubei and southern Shaanxi, being the main producing areas. Guangxi boasts thousand-year-old tung oil, with annual exports reaching over 134,000 metric tons, and the national annual output is over 100,000 metric tons. Pig bristles have a rich market potential, with annual exports reaching over 5,100 metric tons. Raw silk exports reach over 1,700 metric tons, and wool exports are approximately 132,000 metric tons. If a new exchange rate can be determined soon, trade in these commodities will undoubtedly become more active.</p>

<h3>Asphalt Prices Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>Recently, the asphalt market has experienced a sharp decline due to the arrival of a large quantity of foreign goods in Shanghai. The price of roofing asphalt is currently around 70 yuan per pound, a decrease of two-thirds compared to last week. The price of ground asphalt is around 45 yuan per pound, a drop of over 100% compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Hard White Lead Wire Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Hard white lead wire, which is normally cheaper than new lead wire, has recently become more popular due to its wider range of uses and limited market inventory. As a result, its asking price is now higher than that of new lead wire. Currently, sizes 11, 12, and 13 are selling for 30,000 yuan per dan, almost the same as the peak price.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Price Figures</h3>
<p>The chaos in the commercial market in 1945 was unprecedented since the start of the war. Currency inflation was over a thousand times that of before the war, and social purchasing power was less than 10% of pre-war levels. Prices rose to nearly 2,400 times pre-war levels. The following are the Chongqing price indices for recent years from the United Credit Reporting Institute (with the price index in 1937 as the base of 1):</p>
<p>(Price Index in 1937 = 1)</p>
<p>1937: 1.1</p>
<p>1938: 1.3</p>
<p>1939: 2</p>
<p>1940: 6</p>
<p>1941: 17</p>
<p>1942: 51</p>
<p>1943: 136</p>
<p>1944: 316</p>
<p>1945: January: 492</p>
<p>February: 566</p>
<p>March: 734</p>
<p>April: 963</p>
<p>May: 1040</p>
<p>June: 1084</p>
<p>July: 2304</p>
<p>August: 2416</p>
<p>September: 2082</p>
<p>October: 2037</p>
<p>November: 2373</p>
<p>December: [Blank]</p>
<p>The above table shows that prices in the latter half of 1945 doubled compared to the first half. Prices in 1945 rose approximately seven times compared to 1944. Nationally, Chongqing ranked first in price increases, except for Kunming. (Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chongqing had the highest prices among major cities in the country. However, since 1941, Kunming took over due to the dominance of foreign capital and rampant speculation. According to statistics, the price index in Chongqing in August 1945 was 2,416 times, while in Kunming it was 7,453 times, approximately three times higher than Chongqing.)</p>
<h3>New York Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] The New York cotton market opened steady yesterday, with no initial fluctuations, then rose three points. Market conditions were calm, and new cotton was more stable. Industry demand for old cotton was met by several suppliers, causing a slight relaxation. The supply of new cotton was limited, trending slightly upward. The market closed steady, with old cotton down one to three points and new cotton up three to eight points.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Raw Silk Arrives in San Francisco</h3>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Works</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>I remember a French writer once said: "A dull article passes through the ages like a mummy that will not decay, but other articles, full of flabby flesh and fat, and adorned with gorgeous rhetoric, will only have some crowns, rings, and ornaments dug from their tombs by later generations." Today, those great classical works are a steel-like testament. Therefore, we can also get an answer from this: works that are passed down through the ages not only rely on gorgeous rhetoric. At the same time, this is also the reason why many magnificent works are rejected by history.</p>
<p>When Emile Zola was publishing the history of the Rougon-Macquart family ("Les Rougon-Mac-quarl") in the newspapers, he suffered an unexpected blow (this can be said to be the inevitable experience of a writer who is faithful to a social era, and conversely, it is also a proof of the writer's success). There was even a low-quality critic who barked wildly: "Selling out the motherland! It's simply throwing the maggots on his own body into the pile of pure people." This should be a response to a work that delves into the core of society. At least, a group of 'pure people' in France should have discovered that their countrymen were already infested with maggots. In China, some writers are attacked precisely because they expose the decayed Chinese society without any cover.</p>
<p>Today's Soviet literature cannot be compared with the Tsarist era of Russia. Just read A. Tolstoy's essay, for example, "Soviet Literature in the Past Twenty-Five Years," which says, "...The spiritual category has played a decisive role in this war. Language is no longer just the coal burning in people's hearts. Language is like millions of bayonets charging into battle. Language has the power of artillery barrage."</p>
<p>If we use the above rules as a yardstick to evaluate the literary scene in Shanghai in the past, then I don't know what the result should be. I just want to (please note, just think!) Do we want to explore its results? (Even if we know the result will be so bad)</p>
<p>Modern Soviet writers have repeatedly proposed re-evaluating classical works. They frankly say that Dostoevsky's style of melancholy is already an old trace of the past era. This clearly and undoubtedly tells the truth about their progress. Conversely, can we say "Down with meaningless groaning and empty shouting"? -- The answer is still no. To be honest, in dozens of monotonous love novels, we still can't find a character as successful as the classical Lin Daiyu, although cunning writers dress them in fashionable cheongsams and apply lipstick recently imported from France. That is also to no avail.</p>
<p>It's very ridiculous (it's actually shameful!), among several of us young writers who specialize in writing about the conflict between revolution and love (?), they don't even understand what revolution is all about! As for a very smart term: dual personality, they always hang it on their lips, which are specially for sipping coffee, kissing, and drinking whiskey. Their interpretation is: to make a revolution and then fall in love.</p>
<p>Regarding examples, I don't want to give them either. It's really "everywhere you look."</p>
<h3>Beware</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>New Year's Day, a morning like spring. We were walking on the street. Because all vehicles and pedestrians were changing to "keep to the right" from this day onward, everyone had a trace of caution at the beginning, so everything presented a slow mood.</p>
<p>I have always been afraid of the tense life in Shanghai. The vehicles that fly like shooting stars, the hurried passers-by, the busy people are busy, the not-busy people are also busy, the urgent things are urgent, the not-urgent things are also urgent, as if there is never a time to rest. If you want to rest, you can only stay at home.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in this way, for the sake of keeping to the right, the excessive tense air was adjusted. So we can walk freely on this street full of warm sunshine, watching the cars slowly drive by and the trams run leisurely.</p>
<p>I laughed. Careful Kailan said, "But I can't be as leisurely as you are. I always have to be careful."</p>
<p>"Beware, yes!" I said to her, "I'm not being uncautious. I believe I can remember it. Is it possible to make a special dress with a left-over garment for this?"</p>
<p>Kailan laughed and urged, "Of course, we can be careful ourselves, but can you beware of other people's carelessness?"</p>
<p>I paid close attention to her words and am willing to never forget them, because this should not only be remembered when I "walk on the stone side," but also when we run through the difficult journey of life, we should also be careful of this point.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yingpeng's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>It is so pleasant to visit Mr. Zhu Yingpeng's exhibition on the first New Year's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War! Especially for those of us who study art. Mr. Zhu is a senior in the art world and also a veteran of the Chinese literary and art movement. He has made many contributions that deserve our admiration.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Zhu lived in seclusion in Shanghai, firmly guarding himself, and using calligraphy and painting to pass the time. The works in this exhibition are his harvest over eight years. All the works are one hundred and fifty points, divided into five rooms, with figures accounting for about two-fifths, and landscapes, flowers and birds, etc. accounting for three-fifths. They integrate Chinese and Western painting into one, while fully maintaining the unique style of Chinese painting. The figure paintings are all portraits of national heroes of past dynasties, Guan Yu, Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, Qi Jiguang, etc. This point is quite noteworthy. Mr. Zhu described the majesty of our nation at this time and place. The profound meaning and the great influence have unimaginable effects, and the lines of the clothes are smooth and lively, so-called "Cao Yi coming out of the water, Wu Dai blowing in the wind," this place can have both. As for the expression and demeanor, solemn and solemn, it is not limited by the small size of the painting. This is even more of Mr. Zhu's unique skill.</p>
<p>Among the landscape paintings, the most recommended are "Pine and Stone" and "Cyan and Green" and other works. The former is an imitation of Yunlin, a kind of elegant and simple atmosphere, overflowing on the paper. There is no smoke cloud rendering, but the smoke is full of the picture. This is not pleasing to the eye, I think it is commonly known by those in the know. The latter is a accumulated inch style page, mounted as a hanging scroll. The mountains are not too high, but dotted with small water pavilions, which makes the peaks appear towering. The water is not too deep, but interspersed with several rows of trees, which makes the autumn water appear long. The ancients said: "Within a foot, there is the power of a thousand miles." I see it in Mr. Zhu's works. Mr. Zhu said in the epilogue: "Li Sixun's cyan and green cannot avoid carving... Wang Shigu devoted himself to it for thirty years before he realized its method." Indeed, Mr. Zhu knows the traces of the transformation of cyan and green, no wonder he has such success.</p>
<p>This time, there are few flowers and birds, such as plum blossoms and daffodils. Although the style is small, the charm is not small. Mr. Zhu's feelings, the feelings during the Anti-Japanese War, are completely symbolized clearly in these flower and bird paintings. "Crane Cries in Jiugao" is especially outstanding, with the inscription: "I cherish my feathers and stand in the wind and dust, singing old-fashioned songs, the sound of which resounds throughout the world!" What a vast world! Finally, I feel that Chinese painting originally needs to be fully coordinated, with the three perfections of poetry, calligraphy and painting, and none can be missing. There are many inscriptions on each painting of Mr. Zhu's works. The handwriting is also delicate and vigorous, and the bookish atmosphere is very strong. He can be called a rare versatile painter in the contemporary era.</p>
<h3>On Reading Poetry and Reflections</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>I happened to think of Lu Fangweng's poem: "A lone shadow of a new goose flying south, lodging in the deep cold clouds among the reeds; I don't know the Xiang River and Baling road, but remember if you've been to Yuyang and Shanggu!" This scene and feeling are like last night's cold moon and heavy frost, and in the air, I seem to hear the geese calling. Also, Fangweng's poem "Mourning Du Fu's Residence at Longxing Temple": "The Central Plains' plants and trees have lost peace, frontier fires and barbarian dust have reached the two capitals; the old minister follows the imperial carriage ten thousand miles, and comes here in his old age to listen to the river's sound." The first two lines have been true for the past seven or eight years, and the last two lines seem to be a portrayal of me leaning against the railing and looking at the Jialing River this morning. These were my thoughts last winter, and now when I think back, the fleeting moments seem like yesterday.</p>
<p>Liang Qichao inscribed on the Jiannan Poetry Collection: "For a thousand years, the poetry world has been filled with decadent winds, the spirit of the army has vanished, and the national spirit is empty; nineteen poems in the collection are about the joy of joining the army, an eternal man, Fangweng." Between the lines, he greatly praises Fangweng's poems. However, for over a thousand years, only mentioning Fangweng seems like pandering to his preferences while neglecting other poets. Cao Zijian's "White Horse Poem": "Charging into the Xiongnu, glancing to the left at the Xianbei; abandoning myself to the edge of the blade, how can I cherish my life? I do not care for my parents, let alone my children and wife. My name is written in the register of brave men, and I cannot harbor personal feelings; I sacrifice myself to the country's difficulties, and regard death as returning home!" It's full of generosity and excitement, and the words are heroic and magnificent. The lines "I do not care for my parents" and those following seem to be unprecedented among ancient poets. It is similar in tone to Ruan Sizong's "Expressing My Feelings" poem: "I cannot even protect myself, let alone love my wife and children!" However, Cao's poem is tragic and heroic, while Ruan's poem is desolate and poignant, making them somewhat different. Jia Sidao's poem: "Ten years I have honed my sword, its frosty edge has never been tested; today I hold it up for you, who has any grievances?" In the past ten years, what has been more unjust than the invasion and oppression of our entire nation by the Japanese pirates? The frosty edge should be tested on the invaders, and without asking, everyone agrees that it should be applied to the enemy. However, now that victory has arrived, we are not pursuing revenge, in accordance with our demeanor as a great nation. However, does Jia's poem only talk about "decadent winds?" Liang Qichao has a peculiar obsession and disregards other works, which is unfair.</p>
<p>"Iron horses cross the river, the wind breaks the flesh, cloud ladders attack the fort, and snow levels the trenches. Beasts scatter like birds, no need to pursue them, directly decapitate the Chanyu with a treasured saber." "The barbarian bowed his head and awaited heaven's doom, abandoning fields that are scattered across the battlefield. Quickly chase the fleeing horses in the snow, the official army enters Liaoyang in the middle of the night." These are two of the four poems in Fangweng's "Suddenly Inspired by the Desire to Join the Army in the Snow." This time, the central army "entered Liaoyang in the middle of the night" and recovered the three eastern provinces, reflecting this magnificent scene.</p>
<h3>Remembering Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Chen Gange</p>
<p>I wanted to send my feelings to the distant northern country, but not only can I not deliver my long-standing homesickness, but the recollection of endless past events only deepens it. I can only let the endless emotions be painfully and bleakly entrusted to the depths of my heart, to let it linger!</p>
<p>When I left this water village, it was the season of willows darkening and flowers brightening, and the hillsides were covered with peach blossoms, their slanting shadows entering the rippling lake. Do you think I'm forgetful? I can still tell you: A group of five or six-year-old siblings rushed into the small boat parked by the lake, swaying and drifting to the center of the river, using their tender white hands to pluck the newly bloomed lotus flowers; you were so anxious that you accidentally stepped into the rice field and rushed over to stop them. But the group of them, embracing the newborn flowers, went to the other side, and, from time to time, turned their heads to give you a hearty laugh!</p>
<p>I have long been thinking about Yunzao Creek, I wonder how it is now? There are dams built of large stones, and every summer, many nearby residents, naked, walk from the shore into the river, heading straight for the water tower in the river. The scorching sun makes the river water too warm, slapping on their bodies, scorching their skin purple. Looking from afar, ah, there are still a few floating shadows, chasing the silvery ribbon of the three-way stream. In the blink of an eye, it's spring again, and the ancient Longhua Temple in the setting sun stands among the multicolored peach blossoms, making it even more majestic and solemn! Perhaps it is much older now, but over the decades, it has witnessed countless human joys and sorrows, and staged many human dramas!</p>
<p>The scenery of Jiangnan, separated by eight long years, even if it is covered with impurities, someone will quickly wash away the dust for it; while the martyrs have since left their beautiful hometown. As for me, perhaps I will revisit the place full of peach blossoms, overlooking the lake; perhaps there is still a broken boat left there, but there will never be five or six-year-old siblings coming to play again. They are being baptized by the times, not only is every younger generation already graceful and upright, but they have all grown a calm heart, but their innocent childhood forms have since disappeared along with the martyrs, never to return!</p>
<p>Being in the distant northern country, seeing the high mountains and deep waters, blocking a peaceful lake and mountain scenery of Jiangnan, how can one not sigh? But the passing water flows, winter ends and spring comes again, and at that time, there will still be so many young men and women, interspersed between the red peaches and green willows; while the passes are still ten thousand miles of desert, desolate and uninhabited, how can it not increase the traveler's desire to return home? When I look in the mirror again, I will have added a few more wrinkles.</p>
<p>"Where is my childhood?"</p>

<p>In today's world, is corruption limited to "officials" only? If we were to clear up the people's proper total income and their actual total expenditure, we would realize that many things have the suspicion of corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption cannot be forgiven. All corrupt "officials" should be severely punished, from imprisonment to execution. All corrupt "people" should also be fundamentally punished.</p>
<p>If we define legitimate income as: "the deserved reward obtained through labor (including physical and mental labor)," then all material obtained without labor or obtained through labor that exceeds what is deserved is illegitimate income. What is illegitimate income? It is actually corruption. Therefore, officials who accept bribes are corrupt, those who use their power for personal gain are corrupt, those who misuse seals for themselves or their friends during receiving are corrupt, clerical staff who take commissions are corrupt, and speculators, profiteers, and hoarders are all corrupt figures.</p>
<p>The root of corruption lies in extravagance and living beyond one's means, and the most fundamental reason is the existence of the private property system. We can inquire and ask, which of the contented laborers and honest farmers are corrupt? Corruption and luxury are inseparable. Anyone who lives luxuriously must be corrupt and must be corrupt. Therefore, when we oppose corruption, we must also oppose luxury.</p>
<p>A senior civil servant who earns less than ten thousand yuan a month can spend two hundred thousand yuan on one banquet, lose three hundred thousand or five hundred thousand yuan in one gambling session, dance the night away in a dance hall, and give away two or more diamond rings at a time to win the favor of a dancer. How can you say he is not corrupt? At the same time, it is very easy for us to investigate corruption. Anyone who lives extravagantly and acts generously is probably a corrupt person.</p>
<p>Raising the standard of living means raising it for everyone, not just raising it for a few people. The most fundamental way to eradicate corruption is naturally to start with reforming the social system. China does not want to create a capitalist society, so this reform is easy. Secondly, a more fundamental approach should also start from reforming social customs.</p>
<p>Eradicating corruption by only focusing on corruption itself has very little effect. Shanghai is now launching the New Life Movement again, emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. How can corrupt people know shame? To realize the New Life Movement, we must eradicate all kinds of corruption before we can talk about "knowing shame" and the New Life Movement!</p>
<h3>Flying Together (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"The great waves of the era swept away the rotten dregs, and then rolled in the birth of a new century."</p>
<p>The Republic of China was established in the glory of this "new century"! Some of those "dregs" flowed downstream and disappeared, while others sank into the mud!</p>
<p>The dregs that sink into the mud are forever unclean, soaked in cold and dampness, but occasionally they are favored by the sun. Over time, the dregs can turn into essence!</p>
<p>After the "dregs turn into essence," they can no longer survive in the "mud." They need to go ashore and sublimate, but the earthworms and scorpions in the mud will surround them and drag them deeper! At the same time, the "shore" is so high and so far away; climbing up is not an easy task. Moreover, the magnificent shore walls often will not accept this product from the mud. Thus, it takes a lot of struggle for them to get from the mud to the shore, and they have to endure a lot of ruthless torment!</p>
<p>In this way, some of the essence is still buried in the mud! They cannot turn over; they cannot shine; their loss is the loss of the universe!</p>
<p>In the history of the world, the immortal things are successful essence refined from dregs. Similarly, in human history, the heroes and great men are successful essence refined from dregs. Just as gold is panned from sand.</p>
<p>Dregs can turn into essence, and natural essence, or carved essence, can also turn into dregs. Therefore, we should not despise dregs as waste; we should always pay attention to the fact that brilliant essence can also be refined from dregs; and after discovering it, we should nurture it well and cherish it. All evolution in the universe depends on this essence.</p>
<p>However, there is little space for essence, and there are not many immortal things in world history, nor many heroes and great men in human history; therefore, all evolution in the universe is also robbed very slowly.</p>
<p>Within thirty-five years, Chinese society, on the surface, is like a pool of filtered clean water; but in reality, countless residual poisonous bacteria of the old society have leaked down; they lurk in all strata of society; and multiply, spread; to produce a dark force; creating countless terrible evils - as a result, this pool of clear water is only a cosmetic facade; inside it is a complete mess; and gradually ripples of chaos are rippling, even affecting the tranquility of the "surface"!</p>
<p>Dregs are different from "bacteria." Dregs are a rejected, superfluous thing; while bacteria are a conspiratorial eroding force. Too much dregs will at most cause a feeling of disgust; unlike bacteria, which frighten you, they are enough to cause destruction and annihilation; they can poison a person's body; they can poison a social system; they can poison a country's policies; and they can poison the trend of the entire world.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people, societies, and countries have been sacrificed under "bacterial poisoning"; almost the entire world has been overthrown!</p>
<p>If you want the people to be happy; if you want society to be peaceful; if you want the country to be strong; if you want the world to be at peace; you can only eliminate bacteria and destroy bacteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not enough for the great waves of the era to only sweep away the rotten dregs; we must completely filter out the toxic bacteria; in order to ensure that the birth of the new century is safe and healthy!</p>

<h3>To Prevent Banditry, "Civil Police Corps" Should Be Organized Quickly</h3>
<p>— Junyi</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, one can read news of robbery and kidnapping cases almost every day. During this winter defense period, the authorities are making every effort to consolidate public security in the city. Unfortunately, this bad result still occurs. For the safety of the city's five million people, how can one not be concerned! At present, the police stations seem to be working very hard on arrest work. We believe that instead of intensifying arrests after the fact, why not find a way to prevent problems before they occur? The responsibility for maintaining public security cannot be entirely pushed onto the police station. Given the vast area of Shanghai, the police force naturally feels insufficient. For their own safety, citizens should immediately bring out their own strength to organize a "Civil Police Corps."</p>
<p>During the enemy-puppet period in the past, there was a similar organization - the Self-Defense Corps, but due to the management system and the corruption of personnel, citizens have complained about it for several years. After the victory, it was soon eliminated. However, in fact, we cannot deny that this kind of strategy of using the police force of public groups to prevent bandits and undesirable elements from mixing and acting rashly is indeed the most effective countermeasure. As a result, it eventually makes them have nowhere to hide and disappear. The merit of the self-defense corps cannot be denied. Recently, the Baojia organization in this city has also been reorganized and perfected. As long as the bad system of the past is reformed and excellent personnel from the Baojia in each district are selected to be responsible for handling it, they can easily become familiar with it, which can save effort and achieve twice the result. The citizens only need to sacrifice some limited spirit and time to get the protection of life and property, then what is there to complain about!</p>
<p>The main reason for the rampant bandits, we still cannot blame on the increase in the number of unemployed and the soaring prices. As long as the factories start work quickly, the unemployed will have jobs, and the prices will fall, so that everyone can easily fill their stomachs. Why do these bandits have to take risks and engage in this life-threatening career! Therefore, to actively eradicate banditry, the authorities still need to solve these two problems.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the Treatment of Small Clerks, and Thoroughly Investigating the Aid to Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Since the war broke out, the most painful thing has been for us small clerks in companies who live on salaries. Usually, because we have no background or connections, no matter how hard we work, there are very few opportunities for salary increases. One month's income is often not enough to support a husband and wife. Taking the company where the writer works as an example, although the scale is quite large (the capital before the war had reached more than 11 million yuan), the treatment of small clerks is very meager. When the Pacific War broke out, the company implemented a non-public salary system, canceled the small clerk's subsidies (firewood, rice, oil, and cloth subsidies), and increased the salaries of a few special personnel. At the same time, those who participated in black market transactions were given special awards by the authorities during festivals. As a result, the small clerks became more and more suffering, and the special personnel became more and more prosperous. The most heartbreaking thing is that the company spent a lot of money to buy a machine and donate it to the enemy, and then specially prepared 400 boxes of gifts to give to the personnel who contacted the enemy army. According to the writer's investigation, the company's expenses this time are enough to pay the salaries of all the company's small clerks for more than 30 years with a surplus. The company's behavior is not only harsh to the small clerks, but also has the suspicion of aiding the enemy. I hope that the wise Social Affairs Bureau will find a way to correct it. Deng Liang</p>
<p>Announcement to Patients with "Kidney Dropsy"</p>
<p>This column has recently received letters from readers and requests to the museum for "Kidney Dropsy" treatment methods, dozens of times a day, which shows that people suffering from this disease are very common. This column has asked Mr. Qu Cunpu to return the effective prescription he received and ask famous doctors to carefully study it again. As soon as we receive a reply, we will publish it immediately. We hope readers will pay attention and do not bother to visit in vain! Editor</p>
