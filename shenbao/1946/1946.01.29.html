<h3>調處工作可進入坦途　恢復交通在談商中　晉察綏冀衝突已停止</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕調處部今後之軍事衝突調處工作，似可進入坦途，而逐漸進入恢復交通會商階段。在外交·內政備極錯綜複雜之赤峯問題上，政府曾作重大讓步，三方協議於昨日深夜成立，並立即發表第五號公報，否認曾令杜聿明將軍進佔赤峯，並聲明執行部命令國軍及共軍各級將領遵行停戰命令，停留於三十五年一月十三日午夜前之地點，且曾令任何一方軍隊不得進駐赤峯以接收蘇軍或將撤退後之防地，此項公吿已自二十七日晨七時起生效。熟悉內幕之官方人士向記者指陳，此爲政府方面力求和平之重大讓步，緣中蘇曾議定北緯二十八度以北中國地區，蘇軍於受降完畢撇退後，由國民政府軍隊接防，故國軍前往接防，實屬正當之舉，若以停戰辦法而論，則蘇軍二十三日始行撤退，十三日午夜以前共軍旣未佔有赤峯，則國軍於蘇軍撇退後實行進駐，更無不合，但政府力求和平實現，乃作重大讓步，同意不令國軍進駐，共方對該處情形之解釋則謂，共黨早在抗戰期，已於該處進行地下活動，勝利後並建立地方政權及軍隊，如國軍遵守停戰命令，則不立進駐該城，幸者此事已因三方協議，兩軍皆不進駐該城，而獲解決。但現駐該城之保安隊究屬中立方面或中共方面及可否繼續留駐，將爲一値得注意問題，以記者所獲消息，調處執行部在近二三日內已積極進行恢復交通問題之商對，惟談商似無大進展。交通當局今日向記者表示，舉凡有關恢復交通之經費，器材，人工等，俱已準備齊備，僅待中共之同意。言之頗有「萬事齊備只欠東風」之概。並吿記者，安陽。包頭等地負責搶修人員，曾請求共軍允許開始修路，共軍以尙未奉到命令爲辭，執行部中共方人士則認爲，恢復交通實施包括器材人員護路等極複雜之問題，亟需長時商討，並具體說明其願望爲「鐵路中立化」，一般判斷，欲迅速恢復交通，不僅需美方人員調處，且需美方技術人員參加其事</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二十八日電〕軍事調處執行部派出小組，分赴各處執行停戰令，已吿一段落，今日開始處理第二件候復交通問題。三委員會同參謀人員，夜以繼日在協和醫院總部所在地討論着手辦法。共黨方面主張，恢復交通應包括鐵路，河道，公路，郵電等全部交通。中央方面則謂，全部交通固應及早開放，但鐵路運輸最感需要，故應最先予以恢復。此種爭執，去年秋間在重慶談判時即已發生，今仍未解決。共然方面並要求，交通綫一經恢復，應保證其不作助成戰事之用，足見彼此猜疑尙未完全消除。調處執行部所當處理之第三件事即解除日軍武裝問題，雙方同意暫不進行。膠濟路日軍一千二百人。暫准其繼續携帶槍械械。</p>
<p>〔合衆社熱河赤峯飛機場二十八日電〕美海軍飛行人員，本日下午携帶軍事調處執行總部命令及供應物，與在赤峰勾留已歷十日之三人監導團發生接觸。彼等駕駛之美國運輸機兩架，載有共軍司令段蘇源（譯音）自熱河共軍大本營承德，飛抵此間飛機塲，段氏携有命令，着赤峯區內共軍對於監導團或執行連絡工作之美人准予自由通行，不得留難。</p>
<h3>豐鎭會談成產裝置定　徒手兵可入對方個別領區</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿八日電〕軍事調處執行部今日發表聯合公報稱，據派往大同之執行小組報吿，山西北部，察哈爾西南，綏遠東南及河北西部國共兩軍衝突，現已完全停止，執行組代表與男共兩軍司令在豐鎭舉行會談，刻已成立協定，內容計有以下六點：</p>
<p>（一）雙方軍隊各撇至一月十三日午夜，即停戰協定生效前所駐地點。</p>
<p>（二）雙方各出吿示，並登報聲明，停戰區內該區各城市間可以恢復貿易，大同區內業已恢復。</p>
<p>（三）雙方互派聯絡官，此事已在進行中。</p>
<p>（四）雙方徒手士兵可自由進入對方佔領區內，此項行動業已開始</p>
<p>（五）立即釋放所有俘虜。</p>
<p>（產）撇底搜索全區，並收集區內所有鐵軌，火車，枕木，電話及電綫，置於各鐵路綫附近，妥爲保存。</p>
<p>（上述停戰區內之鐵路，計有正太鐵路及同蒲鐵路）。</p>
<p>此外，執行部並宣布擴充執行組，擬新設八組，配有全副無綫電設備，另有十五組，配有輕便無綫電設備。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿八日電〕派赴大同之調處部執行小組，今日來無綫電訊稱，該組正在豐鎭與國共兩軍將領進行會談，情形滿意。共方將領爲山西省大部共軍之司令長官賀龍將軍，國軍方面爲晋北地區司令朱喜川將軍雙方參謀長及高級將領均在塲。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕聞軍事調處執行部對調處海州附近及蘇北運河之軍事衝突，已予甚大之關切，已令徐州小組就近至東海一行，俟濟徐二執行小組任務完成後，再沿津浦而南來，屆時可能成立一蘇北小組。</p>
<p>〔中央社兗州廿七日電〕廿五日迄廿七日。兗州三晝夜無槍聲，人心漸安，電克上校等邀鐵路專員王永容等商恢復交通問題。</p>
<h3>六報話幹綫短期內完成</h3>

<h3>延安人口減少　共黨總部無意離廷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社延安廿八日電〕此間人口在戰時曾自二萬人增至六萬人，自日軍投降後，即逐漸減少，現在之數恐不致超過三萬人，離去者以學生及小工業工人佔大部份，大抵係往張家口承德等較大城市。外傳共黨總部亦將自延安遷往張家口，記者日昨以此詢朱德，據答稱，目下無意離開廷安，旋又帶笑日，「協商如圓滿，則吾人有往南京之一日，亦未可知。」</p>
<h3>白崇禧抵錫　檢閱各地駐軍</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿八日電〕白崇禧廿八日在丹陽，常州視察後，下午四時偕湯恩伯乘專車蒞錫，軍民齊集車站歡迎，白氏旋至三方面軍司令部會見記者，談話歷一小時，此行乃檢閱各地駐軍，並代表蔣委員長慰問八年苦戰之將士。國軍多已照中央整軍方案整調，故多已實行新編制。抗戰以來國軍增加至三百四十餘師，現已裁三分之一。白氏尙須至其他各處檢視，數週可畢，定廿九日上午八時赴社橋頭檢閱駐軍，十時至三方面軍司令部，對各部隊長官及各機關首長訓話。</p>
<h3>江蘇四十一縣推行政令順利　程中行今日由京返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕代表人民行使監察權之蘇監察使程中行，今日下午四時受京市記者公會盛大歡迎，由龔德柏主任，致介紹詞後，程即席發表演說，並謂戰時之監察院，對凡已經成立之彈劾案，業予報紙以披露之便利。會後據程語本報記者云，江蘇六十二縣，現政令完全可以推行者，約四十一縣（江南二十五縣，蘇北十六縣），目前人民因不堪重負，所受之痛苦，不可忽視。聞政府已於三十五年度之預算內，設法補救，但在此過渡期間，欲期政府一切措施，合法合理，而且近情，自非從速樹立民意一機構不爲功。程氏定廿九日返滬。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會請增畜牧經費</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕據悉，參政會駐會委員會前提請政府增加本年度畜收經費，俾能配合西北經濟建設計劃，充裕西北民生，茲聞主管當局，對此頗多注意，聞有另設機構，專司其事說。</p>
<h3>京失事美飛機在紫金山發見</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕自上海起飛之美國。G-47型軍事運輸機，失踪以後，經兩天之搜索，已於今日在紫金山上發見焚燬之機身及美飛機師四人之遺體。該運輸機於星期六在暴風雨中失事，墮毀於南京東門外紫金山上，該機並未載客，遇難者均係飛行人員。四機師之遺體將於明日運至上海殯殮，並　葬於該處。死者姓名將俟美陸軍當局通知其親戚後，然後予以宣布。該陸軍運輸機之失事，尙係日軍投降以來在南京所發生之第一次飛機失事，美陸軍航空隊當局刻正調查失事經過情形，其詳情容後公布。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕收復區鐵路分區管理問題，交通主管部門曾迭經討論。聞原則大致決定目前援照敵人分區制度者，係因時制宜，便於接收，將來仍恢復原來鐵路綫管理制，並按照地域，與在國防上之連擊，分成若干區，統籌數鐵路之行政管理，俾能統籌使用增强運輸效能。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕據悉公路總局除擬定之第三期公路緊急工程，亟待實施外，現並將視其需要重新修築新路，刻對舊有公路，予以調整。茲悉川滇西路，原以戰事需要，開闢途徑，大小凉山海拔極高，茲因戰事結束，已於二十五日合併雲南公路分局。川滇東路，則待一部物資運竣，亦將予以裁併。此外川康公路，工程險阻，行旅稀少，主管方面，擬有栽撤之議。</p>
<h3>政府組織獲協議　保障人民法交國防會通過　二中全會定三月一日舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕政治協商會議，廿七日因民主同盟代表以抗議憲警搜查事，要求立即實踐保障人民自由之諾言，拒絕出席，以致政府·國大各組留會，現政府對於該事件主要之人員決予嚴懲，有關實行保障人民自由之法令，政府廿八日交由國防最高委員會通過，即提出大會報吿</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕政治協商會議民主同盟代表，今已決定繼續參加會議，此爲會議圓滿結東之佳兆。該會擬將其錯综複雜之議案於明日或星期三提交委員會及小組委員會討論，以資結束。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕政治協商會議順利結束之希望，仍見濃厚。關於政府組織之內閣制及各黨派均行參加之計劃，頃又有進展。據宣稱：中國新憲制將採川內閣兩院制，不取總統制。政治協商會議之進展情形，足使觀察家相信，過渡政府內，各黨派均將參加。在國民大會採用憲法及普選舉行之前，眞正之聯合政府不致成立。專任草憲工作之分組委員會會議時，一致協議採取內閣制，惟對行政權問題，則形成僵局。會中建議立法院委員半數由國民大會選舉，牛數由民衆公選，行政院委員一部份同國民大會選衆，一部份由省立法機關選舉。該項協議成立後，周恩來即偕陸定一飛返延安，關於五分組委員會之次議，渠擬先與毛澤東商議後，再予以最後同意。</p>

<h3>主席在夏令別墅中　與哈里曼等長談　王外長定今午設宴招待</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕今晨在離城十五哩蔣主席之夏令別墅中，美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，曾與駐蘇大使哈里曼及蔣主席會談數小時之久。內容詳情雖未披露，但此間政界人士頗注視此次會談之特殊意義。哈里曼大使返國途次，甫於昨日午後抵渝，主席曾專派代表往迎，抵渝後，即驅車直達主席之夏令別墅，會晤馬帥，哈氏與馬帥二人與主席同餐，當晚同宿於主席別墅。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿八日電〕哈里曼氏原定二十九日赴滬，茲聞已改於三十日離渝。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕外長王世杰，定二十九日午於外部歡宴美駐蘇大使哈里曼及其夫人與小姐，並邀馬歇爾特使，施麥施參事及夫人，藍達爾少將及魏道明，甘乃光，劉諧，李駿等作陪。</p>

<p>〔聯合社北平二十八日電〕新六軍先遣部隊兩隊，已在秦皇島登陸，現正向錦州移動中，關於蘇軍贊同國軍開入瀋陽之說，迄無報吿，但天津各報載東北消息謂蘇軍擬於二月一日規定日期，自東北多處地點撤退。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿七日專〕據瀋陽電話，新民蘇軍業已撤退，瀋陽我尙未正式接防，入夜瀋市仍無行人。</p>

<h3>安全會初次受試騐　昨日會議空氣緊張　伊代表陳辭要求限令蘇軍撤退　伊申訴案決定延至明日再討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦廿八日廣播稱：整個聯合國機構之基石安全理事會，今日下午而臨是否能　任國際仲裁者之第一次主要試騐。該會己正式准許伊朗陳述其對蘇聯之申訴，當時空氣緊張，公衆旁聽屋內人山人海。開會後，首先討論阿爾巴尼亞請求加入聯合國問題，達一小時之久，最後議決將阿爾巴尼亞之申請加入議程內。旋蘇聯首席代表發言，主張立即討論伊朗問題，但大會決延期至星期三再行討論。安全會主席梅金提議，在討論伊朗申訴時，應准許伊代表參加安全會會議，並訽各代表是否反對此項建議，是時各代表均注目蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基。各代表旣未提出反對，伊代表泰奎柴達即入座，距維辛斯基僅六英尺。伊代表稱：伊政府曾數次以牒文致蘇政府，請求准許伊軍開入亞塞爾拜然，但蘇政府旣未否認亦未作答。伊代表　稱，比次糾紛殊屬遺憾，蓋伊朗原係蘇之盟國，而蘇聯之勝利，伊朗亦與有功焉，最後伊前總理哈基米擬赴莫斯科，亦遭拒絕，於是伊方乃祇得向安全會提出申訴云。伊代表並指陳蘇聯干預伊內政，違反德黑蘭協定，並提出警吿謂，伊朗若不能在其國內自由運兵，則或有悲慘之後果。至是伊代表要求蘇軍在三月二日前退出伊境，並請求安全會通過此項要求。</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊朗京城廿八日電〕伊朗新總理沙丹納今日宣布：渠已訓令聯合國大會伊朗代表團長沙台　，與蘇聯代表團長維辛斯基討論伊朗申訴蘇聯間題。沙台萊在德黑蘭三强會議時任總理，爲維辛斯基之友，能操流利俄語。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十八日電〕昨夜德黑蘭消息傳伊朗總理沙丹納有新訓令發來倫敦交伊期代表團，然截至聯合國安全理事會今日午後會護前四小時，伊朗代表團猶未接此新訓令。按伊朗對蘇聯千涉其內政之申訴，乃在安全理事會今日午後之議程中。</p>
<h3>大會議程行將結束</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會今日舉行第二期會議，討論蘇聯干涉伊朗及英國駐兵希臘東印度等「威脅世界和平」問題。阿爾巴尼亞申請入會一事亦將提出討論，稍後並將討論難民問題，此與聯合國善後救濟總署財政問題之初步討論有聯帶關係。此外，聯合國大會曾接紐約寄來備忘錄一件，文長一萬字，指　阿根廷政府仍爲獨裁政體，以侵略爲目的，並破壞聯合國憲章所規定之一切義務，主張摒棄阿根廷於聯合國機構之外。因此，阿根廷申請入會一事，在本屆會議中未必提出討論。大會議程行將結束，各項要案中尙未討論者爲選舉聯合國機構秘書長及國際法庭法官十五人等。就會議經過情形而論，各小國之遭遇較預料爲佳，其間阿拉伯聯盟及多數拉丁美洲國家曾領導爲小國利益奮鬥，多數小國初恐五强旣在安全理事會中取得操縱地位，在大會中亦將獲得同樣權力，因乃竭力奮鬥，一致堅特大會投票須由多數表決，以削弱大國在會議中之地位，此舉集已如願以償。</p>
<h3>四强着手起草　對義大利和約　法南奧三國要求修正疆界　蘇聯爭取的黎波里托治權</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱，據悉，各國外交部代表，方在此起草義大利和約之草案，英代表曾有設立義大利殖民地託治計劃提出，建議將義大利之殖民地，暫時交起草和約之四强即英法美蘇保管，以待聯合國機構整個託治計劃之完成。四强代表以去秋外長會議留有懸案甚多，現正忙於整理，故英國之建議，一時猶無暇考慮。加以蘇聯主張在的黎波利丹尼亞取得單獨之託治權，蘇代表古賽大正在等待莫斯科之訓令，在未曾接獲以前，當無從討論此項託治問題。過去一二星期中，英美兩國曾有對菲洲殖民地及太平洋島嶼，取得一國託治權之要求。故蘇聯自不甘落後，擬對的黎波利丹尼亞主張相同之權利。蘇聯對於都特卡尼西羣島尙未表示意見，此乃各方所迫切期待之問題。據悉，蘇聯且復支持南斯拉夫對特里埃斯特港之要求。此外尙有賠款問題，英美法認爲義大利旣不應亦無力負担賠款，法國對於義大利之要求，似己較去秋外長會議時爲減少，法人仍要求取得義邊界之勃里迦及丹達，惟己不復索取義國西北部之伐爾道斯達及里比亞南部却特湖附近之地，主張取得義國土地最力者乃戴高樂，戴氏之去職，當使法國之態度趨向緩和。</p>
<h3>羅保問題　英蘇獲諒解</h3>

<h3>東印總理負責　對荷開談判</h3>

<h3>英蘇兩國關係　呈反常狀態　英國予蘇之安全讓步　竟不能獲相對的報償</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十八日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：英國外相在國際會議席時，坐於蘇聯人民外交副委員長之側，竟稱，對蘇聯政府之指責，業已感覺厭倦，可見英蘇兩國關係，或英國之傳統外交政策，業已發生若十意外事件。同時英國各報以「政治欺騙」「亳無信用之行爲」「惡意的無聊行動」等名辭，形容蘇聯之宣傳及外交政策，亦可表示兩國關係之反常狀能。英人確已感覺厭倦，彼等覺蘇聯所要求之特權，乃蘇聯本身所不願讓與他人者，治英國所給與蘇聯之安全讓步，竟不能獲得相對之給付。蘇聯對於波羅的海諸國，波蘭·芬蘭·東普魯士·捷克·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞諸國之要求，英國均未表示反對，然當英國主張與西歐諸國保持更密切之關係，或在南歐或中東實行其安全政策時，莫斯科即表示堅決之反對。英人覺其所面臨之局勢如下：具有四干五百萬人口之英國，竟被具有兩萬萬人口及世界最龐大陸軍之蘇聯，要求承認其與鄰邦政府訂立之盟約，以爲安全之措置，而英國除倚賴聯合國機稱外，反不許有其他之安全佈置。在此種情形下，英國所可能採取之途徑有四：（一）信任蘇聯之好意，任其所爲；（二）恢復均勢政策，不容歐洲大陸僅有一强存在；（三）倚賴聯合國機構；（四）改良聯合國憲章。使諸强或則服從聯合國法律之束縛，或則與各國之聯合力量對抗，此外復以西歐地區協定，作聯合國機構之後盾。就目前形勢　，任何英國政府當不敢信任蘇聯之一腔善意，同時英國或聯合國機構，亦不數對某一强國之侵略，採取若何行動。蓋英政府　懼蘇聯，而對於英國尙未能確定其用憲，故英國之外交政策，以採取前述第四條途徑最爲可能。眞正之均勢政策，乃爲聯合諸國向好戰之國家採取一致行動，出席聯大各國代表預料當和平條約簽訂後，國際間之不定局勢可望稍安，而英蘇兩國之關係或可轉好。</p>
<h3>英前閣員　指責工黨政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十七日電〕英國前保守黨閣員麥克密倫，今日指責工黨政府稱：在工黨領導之下，英國與蘇聯友好關係已逐漸减退，即與美國亦遠不似往日之親密。以前據稱工黨執政後，英蘇關係，可立即改善，但時至今日，吾人與舊盟友之友好關係，巳受嚴重威脅云。</p>
<h3>英美商業航空成立互惠協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社首墓大島漢彌兩敦廿八日電〕英美兩國討論互惠商業航空權利問題歷兩星期，聞已於今日成立協定。衆信美國或將與其他各國成立性質相同之協定。</p>
<h3>向印度議會魏菲爾致辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿八日電〕印督魏菲爾勳爵今日向印度中央議會發表歷來最短之總督訓辭，謂英國政府具有決心，務必成立由各政治領袖組成之行政委員會，並儘速組織制憲機關。余目前不能詳談此等機構組織之辦法，亦不能說明如何可以克服種種困難，同時亦未便確定印度獲得自由之日期。余僅能向諸君擔保，此等事件當爲倫敦及新德里政府首先進行之事項。印督復謂，諸君之中或有願意投票反對政府之措施者，此事之行否，當由諸君自爲決定。但余覺立法乃印度人民全體之利益，如有阻止或遲延之者，實爲近視政策。</p>
<h3>倫敦民衆大會　要求准印度獨立　並同情東印越南解放鬥爭　會後列隊遊行向政府請願</h3>
<p>〔路透肚倫敦二十八日電〕印度聯盟昨在此問特拉法爾加廣塲舉行反對英國在印度及印度尼西亞施策之示威大會，參加者逾二千人，警察特在各要點佈置崗位，嚴密戒備。納爾遜紀念像之四週遍插大會黨國旗，演說者即於紀念像基之上發言，孟哲斯特議員　金遜首先發表演說，謂諸君乃倫敦之代表，此一機會可以表示對爪哇·越南·及印度之獨立運動，具有深刻之同情，會塲裝有擴音機，印度婦女之彩色服裝，爲大會美麗之點綴。</p>
<p>會塲圖柱懸有豆幅「收穫完全之勝果」之標語。威爾斯議員柯夫之演說，警吿政府準備應付孟買開槍案之反響，其言有謂，工黨政府雖爲余所擁戴，但如繼續施行帝國主義政策，當不得不使用帝國主義之方法，余誠不願見工黨政府走入此一途徑。時會塲情緒已漸趨緊張，柯夫乃謂，諸君應擁護此一任務，請議員諸公保護東方人民之自由。印度共黨候選人杜特亦謂，吾人在此開會，不僅爲印度·印度尼西亞及越南人民之利益，同時亦爲諸君之利益，吾人當不能令我國之　人參加干涉其他民族自由奮鬥之行動。大會通過兩項決議，即要求印度之獨立及要求英政府承認印度尼西亞之獨立。羣衆於會後列隊遊行，循政府大厦至外交部與印度事務部提出決議書，驕警率先保護繼爲高持大會黨旗轍之印度學生。印度聯盟秘書　曼農。及英國會讓員柯夫與赫金生兩人。遊行行列中有少女老婦·身經兩次大戰之老軍人·英三軍官兵·荷蘭水兵·美飛行員以及印度兵三名。於爾會大厦之大鐘鳴四下，行列出發，待領導人入外交部與印務部時，餘者竚立政府大厦前，高呼口號及嘲　之言。行列旋返特拉發爾加廣塲，主席赫金生告羣衆稱：「吾人已遵命將決議書提交印務外交爾部，在外交部中外相員文留言謂　已被邀出外，但將於一小時內取閱決議書而考盧之。印務部中則無負實人在，印度方在水深火熱中，乃辦理印度事務之處，除與印度事務部毫無關係之一人外，他無人在，吾人不得不將決議書留交其人立即轉致印務部長。兩決議書均將獲得考慮與答覆，而覆文將交報紙公佈，或在此間再度舉行公共集會時發表之。吾人旣巳提出決議案，今所舉行之集會，將在印度越南與印度尼西亞爲人民所談及，而知英網人民擁讓彼等求自由之奮鬥」。與會羣衆旋即捐款二千羅比，充印度聯盟經費，以表示彼等對印度目的之實際同情。行列全長四分之一哩，經紀念碑時，所持印度國旗一律斜執，向兩次世界大戰中戰死者致敬，夾道觀衆殊衆。</p>
<h3>日本女律師　主修正民法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿八日電〕日本十一女律師之一渡邊通子小姐，昨夜發表廣播演說，指　一八九七年制定之日本民法，「充滿封建思想。」渠宣稱：該民法必須加以改訂，俾夫婦得享平等權利。渠稱，日本婦女被列爲准無能力者，一切重要行為均須得其丈夫之許可，妻子無嗣，始可繼承其丈夫之財產。又稱，日本之　婚法，有利于男子而不利于婦女，渠主張任命一委員會，以修訂日本民法，並准許婦女參加該委員會。</p>

<h3>試驗原子彈　各項紀錄及推論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國陸海軍專家正準備以艦隊爲目標，試騐原子炸彈威力。原子彈迄目前爲止，尙祇使用三枚，第一枚係在新墨西哥州昨初次實騐，其餘二枚即用以攻擊日本之廣島及長崎。各專家由此三次經騐，搜集各方情報，獲得下列各項紀錄或推論。（一）炸彈爆發之一剎那間，最初壓力達每吋數十萬磅，隨之發生　風，速率在每小時五百至一千哩，雖爲時甚暫，其力極猛，蓋速率在每小時七十五哩以上者，即尋常所謂　風。（二）在海面實騐時，將激起波浪，自低至頂高達一百呎。（三）在所謂「火球」之中心，熱力可達華氏一萬萬度。當熱浪由中心向四週散播，熟力自將劇烈降低，但猶有猛烈破壞性。據美國科學家報吿，距離炸彈爆發處一哩附近之人，縱不爲「機械力」所殺，亦將被灼致死或重傷。炸彈爆發時又發生大量輻射，此種似鍾之彼，在廣島及長崎兩地，威力所及，雖表皮似毫未受創，但血球組織已受影響，致血液滲出，流人內臟空隙。美國軍官及科學家以爲在攻擊日本二役中，此種射綫並無多少餘力，蓋炸彈係在空中爆發，射綫消失極速，不致在地面滯留。但據若干科學家推測，設炸彈於接近地面處爆發，如此次所計劃者，則可留下大量放射性物質可與數噸之鐳相當。由於此種威脅，實騐地點附近各島，或處放射性波浪或雲片漂及，故爲愼重計，須將島民撤退，以防意外。廣島長崎若干房屋牆壁雖直接受炸，因壓力完全向下，仍屹立未動，但屋頂及地板則均片片碎裂。對於鋼骨建築物之影響，在長崎獲有若干端倪，蓋該處三菱魚雷工廠，即因壓力而完全瓦解。此次實騐時，艦隊究將如何排列，負實人員未肯洩露，僅稱，若干主力艦將置於炸彈爆處之中心，並將廣佈於極大區域，上載自動紀錄儀器，以研究各種不同程度之損害。</p>
<h3>古盎總統籲請國人　協助政府渡難道關　財政民食為當前兩問題　法國外交政策一仍舊貫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山二十八日廣播稱：法總統古盎今日發表文吿：　諸法國人民全力協助新成立之法內閣，以便渡過目前難關。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據巴黎二十八日廣播稱：法總統古盎今同報界宣稱「法政府爲改進國內經濟與財政情形起見，決採取極嚴厲之步　，使人民驚醒，但所有一切決定，必依照民主原則。太人目前責任極重，本人就任總統之職，非由　心所推動，而係由責任心所感召，深盼此種責任心必可鼓舞全體法國人民」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊」據巴黎二十八日廣播稱：新任法總統古盎在今日法內閣會議時，宣稱：「法國外交政策，決無變動，此項政策，前已由法外長在聯合國大會中予以宣佈。新政府現遭遇兩種問題，其一為供應，另一則為財政，本人確信：法國人民必能以彼等在其他困難道時期所表現之毅力，接受此種問題」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕法國臨時總統古盎今日召集新內閣首次會議，並定於明日向議會宣布施政方針。據稱，法國人民或難免聽到不快消息。今日閣議曾討論食糧。財政及國際問題，古盎主張增稅，平定物價，並减削政府支出，以防止通貨膨脹。</p>

<h3>舉世囑目之　美國會動向</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國以至舉世人民均將密切注視美國會對美國向英貸款之處理情形，原因如下：（一）反對方面表現之力量，對於美政府本年度貸款予外國之程序，將有重大影響，此程序現正待對英信用放款批准，以定其前途。（二）由此次辯論情形，可窺見美國會處理事務之行動途徑。（三）由此可證明美國會對杜魯門總統內政計劃之不滿，將否擴　至國會對總統外交關係與國際合作政策之態度。（四）由此可見美國是否迅速投入新的孤立主義。對英放款事，在參衆兩院或將遭遇更危險之重大反對，惟美政府早憶料到，故已擬定應付辦法。</p>
<h3>緬甸要求自治引起美國注意</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕據華盛頓外交界所獲消息：最近在仰光舉行之緬甸反法西斯會議，決議要求緬甸之完全獨立，以代目前之自治領制。此舉已引起美國觀察家之注意。彼等希望今日在仰光舉行之緬甸立法會議，將透露緬甸現政府之意向，而澄淸該國政治局勢。據悉，該最近舉行之會議，亦曾通過決議，譴責解放後緬甸境內盜匪橫行之情形。</p>
<h3>阿爾糾尼亞破獲　反政府陰謀</h3>

<h3>美工潮情勢好轉　罐裝廠工人已於昨日復工　鋼鐵業亦有早日解次徵象</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芝加哥廿七日電〕美國兩大勞工聯合會所屬肉業裝罐工人因要求增加工費實行罷工，政府己於星期六日接管罐裝各廠，現聞星期一日將有工人二十四萬八千名復工，星期三日起可以開始送貨。政府方面今日對其他工潮亦表示樂觀。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕政府要人某於星期日晚預言，鋼鐵業工潮可在一星期內結束。據稱，此消息係自接近主持政府勞工政策之某方面得來，但不能詳細證明。鋼鐵業工潮發生已一星期，內中希望早日解決者自福特。克雷斯勒兩汽車公司工潮解決後，其實力已大爲增强，或可於一星期內得佔優勢，且此外尙有他種壓力，可使之獲得勝利。白宮在三四日內雖不擬干涉，惟此後變化正多，殊屬難料。此次鋼鐵業總罷工，於一月二十日夜半開始，參加工人達八十萬名，徧及三十州一千二百九十二廠，爲美國鋼鐵業歷史上最大之工潮。事前雖經杜魯門總統竭方幹旋，欲使工業組織聯合會與美國鋼鐵公司成立妥協，卒　失敗，僅西海岸鋼鐵廠總理凱塞接受總統提議，允每小時增加工資一角八分半。鋼鐵業工會最初提出要求爲每小時增加工資二角三分，資方僅允增加一角二分半，經一再交涉後，勞方允减至每小時增加一角九分半，資方最多允增一角四分，談判遂於一月十九日破裂，二十日夜半起即實行總罷工。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二十八日電〕路透社外交訪員探悉：英國對於一九四五年十二月二十日埃及就修正英埃條約事所提來牒之覆文，已交予埃及大使，衆信覆文對來牒頗表同情，現正與埃政府籌備同時公佈雙方牒文。消息靈通人士相信，修正條約之日期與方式問題，將由雙方會同檢討之。聞埃及切欲修改蘇丹之地位，並使英軍撤離埃境。一九三六年擬定之英埃條約，僅許英軍於戰時得駐運河區以外，故英軍從埃及大部份區域撤退事，大致可與主要條件問題，分別討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社開羅廿八日電〕埃及閣員三人，昨因政府當局不將埃及獨立及英軍撤退問題向聯合國大會提出，憤而辭職，茲已打　辭意，埃及政潮因吿平息。</p>
<h3>美國造成　新式轟炸機　速度威力無與倫比</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕海軍方面今日發表一威力强大之新式俯衝魚雷轟炸機，將載於米特威式超級航空母艦，其最遠航程可達千七百哩以上，能以每小時五百餘哩之速率垂直俯衝，用四千磅重之炸彈或火箭或魚雷一枚及二千磅左右之炸彈火箭　擊目標。此新式轟炸機稱爲BTM摩勒式，係由巴爾的　之麥丁公司設計製造，專供新式巨型航空母艦之用。平面飛行速率每小時超過三百五十哩，不裝炸彈時毛重一萬七千五百磅，較現在所用之同式飛機的多一千磅。此機裝有特別制動機，可使垂直俯衝之最高速率每小時五百餘哩，减至每小時三百五十哩以內，因此投彈更能準確。其裝翼俯衝制動機在速率極高時可於五秒鐘內放開，此機裝有世界量大之飛機引擎，具有三千匹馬力，其寇蒂斯四頁電氣推進機，直徑十四呎八吋。此機袁廣五十呎，機身長四十一呎八吋，機翼係箱式構造，外翼片可垂直摺疊，以便於航空母艦之搭載。機上裝有二十八厘口徑砲四尊，所帶炸彈，火箭及魚雷均懸於外面。</p>

<h3>新幾內亞探險史的新展開　美空軍發掘大谷　鬈髮野人別有一種生活相　本報編譯室譯自十二月號美國地理雜誌</h3>
<p>「上校，越過山脊，便可進入轉往隱谷的深峽。」</p>
<p>當我在新幾內亞內地拔海乙萬呎高的山地上空，駕駛C-60星型飛機，作曲綫形飛行偵察時，由對講無綫電話筒中傳來上面這些言語。天空中到處望見　　裹一個一個的窟　。吿訴我上面這些話的，是我的訓駕駛員葛立姆軍曹。</p>
<p>一星期前，他發現了新幾內亞的隱谷，當時他飛來飛去，在橘山的峻嶺叢山間，搜索一條此較低窪的山徑。這所隱谷的存在，一直到一九三八年才由美國自然史學探險團的亞區鮑爾博物院向世人透露。白種人到這一哩高，四壁封閉的深谷來，還是第二次。後來，我們知道亞區鮑爾探險團把它改名爲大谷（Grand　Valley）。</p>
<h3>搜索降落塲　兵士變成探險家</h3>
<p>這一次來探險的，不是美國和荷蘭的科學家，却是美國的丘八。</p>
<p>我們的弟兄們來此，目的在找尋可以對付日軍的飛機降落地點。麥克阿瑟將軍在新幾內亞，開始施行跳島戰術時，我們唯一可以供應他的空軍路綫，便在飛越這長一千五百哩，海島東南端的史丹萊山脈。荷蘭第亞攻佔以後，路徑短得多，可以緊貼着麥克阿瑟將軍的前鋒部隊。</p>
<p>盟國西南太平洋空軍總司令凱尼中將（現任上將），命令部下從茂洛克的空軍基地，開闢一條航綫，到荷蘭第亞去，至少要找到一條中間的直航綫，和兩端降落的地點，以便建築基地後立即付諸實用。葛立姆軍曹被派到那邊去偵察，結果發見兩條可能的路綫。他很熱烈地注視這大谷，以爲它很有作爲隆落塲所的可能性。第一條發現的路綫，在大谷西南面約兩百哩，經過伊菲太明地方，我們於是便出發視察。</p>
<h3>斷崖削壁間野人們自成民族</h3>
<p>大谷拔海一哩高，橫躺在亞區鮑爾所發見一帶雪山中的橋山裏。在這些斷崖削壁中間，却居住着奇異的，與世不相往來的部落民族：他們中問有許多人老死不相交往。大谷的南面入口，被　佔兩百哩的濕地和簡單着　曇的溪峽深鎖着。東西面是高達一萬四千呎的層疊陡峰，無異是它的國牆；僅有的可能入口在北面。雙發動星型飛機機員十四人，天一亮，便從茂洛克起飛，在五百呎的高空中，我們就鑽進了　層，雲的頂點還高在八千呎的天空中。</p>
<h3>人頭被割掉　或做鱷魚的點心</h3>
<p>在茂洛克和橘山山脚的中間一段，我們飛越了廣佔兩百哩的濕地。這片濕地，望下去平坦一如彈子桌。　居在這裏的部落，是專事　取人頭的民族，這些野人，和充斥當地的鰻魚，一樣地可怕。從這裏，我們便可很容易看出爲什麼荷屬的太那茂拉流戍殖民地是世界上管理得最有效的道理了。囚犯們唯一的逃越途徑，是順着河流而下，假如他逃入濕地，那末被割掉頭，還是做　魚的點心，便隨他抉擇好了。</p>
<p>飛近橘山時，雲層越發高了！但瞥見有一處峻崖特別峻削。大谷上空，浮起一片少見的白羊　狀雲堆，我們可以看見一個偶然的罅口，我們知道這裏面潛伏着許多山峰，比較高的峰巔，　　出　層之上。</p>
<h3>本文作者及其獵獲之獮猴</h3>
<p>圖中手持獮猴者，即本文作者艾爾斯摩上校。此猴已由艾氏携返美國，轉贈其女。渠曾屢次飛往大谷上空，去年五月間，美軍運輸機在大谷失事後，渠曾熱心從事援救工作，厥功殊偉。</p>
<h3>飛渡橘山高入雲尖　臨大谷上空</h3>
<p>我們需要飛越橘山，並在谷的北面尋出一條路來。我們的飛機升高至一萬七千呎後，方得安全地穿過或環繞着雲尖飛行。我們看見了高遠一萬五千多呎的威爾海姆山峯，眞奇怪呀，這赤這邊的雪山！</p>
<p>我們盤旋三十分鍗後，方始下降。此間山脈櫛比，峯高自一萬三千呎降至六千呎，很淸楚地在新幾內亞北岸伸展着，每一山脈中間，有一條河道，流過濕地。突然間，葛立姆軍曹手指着一處山脊頂上三百呎高的雲堆，在話筒裹歡呼道：「快滑過那山脊！」於是我們便滑過那山脊，進入一所溪峽，然後又重覆飛在靈層下面，喘過一口氣來。我們的飛機越降低，那溪峽也越發變得狹隘。它四週的削壁，也越見峻險。此時我們兜了一個圓圈，一片筆直的懸巖在對面矗立着，我的呼吸陡然緊張起來。可是，葛立姆又發言了：「那懸巖和雲堆的中間，有空隙，我們繼續往中間飛吧，山谷就在這下面！」</p>
<h3>天然大山洞　奔流着滑洛克河</h3>
<p>當我們飛越那懸巖時，觀察得一個大然大山洞，也可以說是天然的大隧道。它的圓項半徑，至少有三百呎高，在我們飛機下面的滑洛克河，突然在此鑽進了深峽的削壁裏面去啦。</p>
<p>在山脊的那一邊，我們看見土人的村落散佈在溪谷上，一直伸展到幾乎高挿雲霄的削壁上面。在這溪谷住下里許處，那滑洛克河道的流水，又從另一山上湧出，繼續曲折地流向它的前途。雲端裏，倐忽開裂一綫隙縫，這寫話式的大谷，便在此時呈露在我們的眼前。</p>
<h3>大谷的全境　是一片肥田沃壞</h3>
<p>這一帶羣山中間，躺着那奇特的部屬村落，我們全部作一島瞰：大谷面積，縱的方面，全長三十哩，一條名叫巴林的大河，流實其間。巴林河從北端一溪峽起，激流成瀑，流入谷中，其勢便形緩滯，出谷後，便又伸入另一所四週都是峻壁的溪峽，倒懸成爲澎湃的湍流，一直到入海爲止。整個谷土，甚至它四週的削壁，都是肥田沃壞，和新幾內亞其他的部份逈異。</p>
<p>農田四週，交織着水溝，農產物到處都滋長着，男女老幼，一律在田間勤勞地墾種着，這又和其他熱帶地方不同。我們的飛機突然出現，當然使這些人們懼怕，飛機急降時，他們都四散亂奔，有的伏在山芋田裏，有的往水溝裏跳。</p>
<p>有一點覺得很奇怪，大谷內的水溝和村落，都整方排列，比諸美國的農田，不稍遜色，他們所種的田，一直擴展到高挿入雲的懸嚴上，美國農夫決不敢爬得那麼高！土人的房屋全都造在山脚邊，有的選隱約躱在　堆裏。</p>
<h3>土人擲長矛　企圖剌擊偵察機</h3>
<p>每一處村落，築有木石籬笆，到處有一種瞭望塔矗立着。我們飛得很低，想看個仔細，這些塔都用樹木拚紥而成，塔尖有一個哨兵，好似站崗一樣，躱在上面。我們的飛機顯將道瞭望制給搗亂了。這個「哨兵」沒命的往下爬，飛也似的向茅屋內溜，我們又一次低飛時，有一個土人竟用他的長矛往上投擲，想刺擊我們的機身。</p>
<p>河道兩旁，建着一所所村屋。這河這無疑地是戰爭部落的天然防禦綫。我們看不見播樑或船隻。但土人們確知道造橋，後來有一次飛近這深谷的山牆時，終於發現一頂吊橋。</p>
<p>我們這次偵察飛行，對於當地土人情形知道得很少，祇在攝影上得到一些跡象。我們覺得此地的土人，比新幾內亞其他部份所遇見的人高大一些。後來順道作戰時，大谷內六萬居民的情形，才知道得更詳細一些。這次僅在空中見到他們的房屋是圓的，造得和愛斯基麼人的雪屋差不多，有的長圓形。多靠近樹木架屋。</p>
<h3>獲得了資料　向伊菲太明飛去</h3>
<p>此地獲得許多照片和關查資料後，我們便向伊菲太明飛去，找取第二處可能降落的塲所無論在距離上，氣候上，航行上伊菲太明都比大谷適宜，我們於是決定用伊菲太明。同時因爲根據幾年前溪洲某考察　　往調查的結果，認爲那裏的土人很和氣，我們不但要避免流血不幸事件，還　要雇用土人從事建築工作。在我們的荷蘭或澳洲友人那裏，一些也不能得到大谷是否有過白人踪跡的紀錄。從那時起，我便和亞區鮑兩通訊聯絡，對照我們所攝取的相片資料。</p>
<p>凡新來的飛行員，都就地經過標準的訓練，以便適合新幾內亞的氣候與水土。水土和日本鬼子一樣有威脅性，所以飛行員不斷飛到大谷上空去實習。戰地通訊員因此便得到了不少有趣味的冒險故事。我曾駕機送喬琪　脫和哈萊潘脫遜到大谷上空去看過一次，他們替大谷取了一個綽號叫它「上格理拉谷。」</p>
<p>迭次飛行結果，去過那裏的飛行員人數相當多，已足够成立一個訪問組織，許多的戰士回國後，都成爲「上格理拉」協會會員，他們都有飛行日期的證書。</p>
<h3>美機失事　娘子軍同罹慘禍</h3>
<p>有一次訓練飛行時，大谷上空遭遇了一次慘劇。這是五月間的事情，一架軍用運輸機失事，跌落在大谷山牆內，機身全部焚燬，廿四人中，祗有五人未死，其中三個，是在荷蘭第亞基地服務的娘子軍隊隊員，在廿四小時以內，她們中間又死了兩個。此次生還的一女兩男，隨後便將許多大谷內希奇古怪的故事吿訴了全世界。</p>
<p>這次，主持援救工作的，便是作者本人。出乎意外的，許多莫明其妙的當地情形，都獲得了答案。</p>
<h3>三兵士出險　好消息遍傳全美</h3>
<p>失事七星期後，這生還的三名軍人方才遇救出險。我們用降落傘把醫務人員，工程人員，降落在大谷內，從事救濟和建築跑道，以便低飛運輸機安降下去。等到氣候良好的時候，便把一切食糧供應品拋下去，上下對講的通訊隊，接着也下去了，我們還廣播新聞給留在這世外桃源的同胞們傾聽。</p>
<p>這是多麼快樂的一件事啊！當生還的那三位男女同志被救回到荷蘭第亞基地的時候。生還的女同志，名呌瑪格萊脫海斯汀司。是娘子軍中的伍長，她所講述的故事，登遍了整個美國的報章雜誌。</p>
<h3>猪玀肥而大　僅在慶祝時烹用</h3>
<p>猪玀的價値很高貴，殺或吃一頭猪，往往要在慶祝的時候才舉行。所以有些豬，在盛節以前被殺的時候，大多長得又肥又大！圓形的屋頂，都塗滿着煤灰，大谷地形極高，常常需要生火，但是房子上却不見有煙囪，煙都從牆隙裏或屋頂厚茅草裏噴出。男子除了下身一條布遮遮之外，絕無其他長物。女子僅有一撮無花果葉織成的。尿布似的東西，繫在臂部前後兩條肥而又大的大腿，爾面全部露在外面，胸部前一絲不掛。</p>
<p>每所村落，式樣都很整齊，香蕉樹到處可見，田裹種滿着甜山芋。男子大都住在石造的圓屋裏，女子則住在長方形屋子內。</p>

<h3>財產租賃所得稅繳納方式之商權</h3>
<p>— 陶公文</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，上海直接稅局成立，將在本市開征財產租賃所得稅。此稅制尙在草創試行時期，稅法或有缺點，自所難免，茲特提供關於此稅繳納方式之意見，</p>
<p>參者：</p>
<p>繳納所得稅</p>
<p>原則上，固應採取自繳方式，但爲經濟與便利起見，不妨改採扣繳方式。不過扣繳者，本無扣繳租稅之義務，故對於扣繳所得稅者，國家應給予適當之獎勵。若初行存款利息所得稅時，政府曾給予金融業扣繳利息所得稅之甲續費，即以此故。凡改採扣繳方式，須具備兩種條件：第一，必須納稅義務人（所得享受人）之人數，遠較扣繳人（所得支付人）爲多，甚至多出千萬倍。如採扣繳方式，則征收費用及繳稅費用，均可大爲改省。第二，必須扣繳人能單獨根據稅法，計算應扣稅額。如存款</p>
<p>利息所得稅</p>
<p>爲全額定率稅，金融業可根據所得稅法第六條所規定之稅率，及各存戶應得之利息數額，計算應行扣繳之所得稅額，不必等待征收機關之通知，方能扣繳。</p>
<p>吾人試觀現在農地以外財產租賃所得稅，採扣繳方式，已具備上述條件乎？曰：並未具備。第一，財產租賃所得稅之納稅義務人（出租人），遠較扣繳人（承租人）爲少，與存款所得稅之納稅義務人（存款客戶）遠較扣繳人（金融機關）為多，情形適値相反。假定本市有房屋出租人一萬人（包括法人）承租人十萬人，今採取扣繳方式，則征收機關須審查十萬份之所得額報吿書，分發十萬份之應納稅額通知書，同時十萬人須至征收機關代報所得額，十萬人須至國庫，或國庫代理機關繳納稅款。甚至有時緻納二百元之稅款，而扣繳人須支出二百元以上之來往車資，並化費價値數倍於二百元之時間。在此種情形之下，表面上人民所負担之財產租賃所得納爲數不多，而事實上所支出之繳稅費用超越稅額數倍，如採取自繳方式，則前例中，因納稅義務人之人數僅及扣繳人之十分之一，故人民，征收機關，及收款機關化於房屋租賃所得稅之人力及物力，可減少十分之九，僅佔扣繳方式下之十分之一。兩相比較，自繳經濟便利乎？抑扣繳經濟便利乎？凡稍具常識者，當不難判別。</p>
<p>第二，財產</p>
<p>租賃所得稅</p>
<p>由於稅率爲超額累進，及出租二處或二種以上之財產，其所有權屬於一個人者，應合併計算所得額之關係，扣繳人實無法單獨決定應該扣繳之稅額，須俟接到征收機關之通知，方能確定。此與存款利息所得稅截然不同者。且特定承租人每月應付之租金雖同，但應行扣繳之稅額，常因出租人應收租金總額之變動，而大有差異。茲舉例以明之：設出租人一月份有房屋五幢，出租與甲乙丙丁四人，每幢房租六千元，按月給付。依照財產租賃出賣所得稅法第三條第六條及施行細則第十二條之規定，應納財產租賃所得稅一千六百念元，每一承租人扣繳所得稅四百零五元。假定二月初，出租人又買進房屋二幢出租，每月每幢收房租六千元，依法該出租人按月應納租賃所得我二干七百七十元，甲乙丙丁應付之房租，未曾變動，而二月份應扣之所得稅額由四百零五元，增至四百六十一元六負六分六厘六毫。在此種稅額未能由承租人獨自確定之塲合，承租人須接到征收機關通知後，方能扣繳所得稅及給付房租。</p>
<p>抑又有進者，農地以外財產租賃所得稅，採取扣繳方式，由扣繳人報吿納稅義務人之所得額（租金），主管征收機關須費甚大之力量，方能毫無遺漏的將屬於同一納稅義務人之所得，匯總計算。在人名未能單一化，及人民財產統計尙未辦理完善之今日，根據散居各地之各扣繳人之報吿，綜合計算納稅義務人之所得額，事實上，恐甚困難。假定某人住所在上海，在上海有房屋出租，又在重慶，廣州，漢口，靑島，均有房屋出租，如採自繳方式，則由出租人親自報繳，不必經綜合計算之麻煩手續，即能獲得納稅義務人之綜合財產租賃所得額。今採取扣繳方式，由各承租人報吿所得額，設各該承租人均爲高等知識分子，將眞正之出租人塡報，關於該出租人之姓名及住所，毫無錯誤，則亦須由重慶直接稅局，漢口直接稅局，廣州直接稅局及靑島直接稅局接到於該出租人所出租之房屋承租人，報吿之所得額後，轉報上海直接稅局，依法綜合計算該出租人之財產租賃所得額，其手續之麻煩，可見一班。征收租稅之方法，應簡單，便利，經濟，為財政學上之重要原則，今財產租賃所得現有大部分採取扣繳力式，顯與此重要原則似相　背。</p>
<p>由此言之，我人如不欲使財產粗賃所得稅成爲名符其實之良稅則巴，否則關於繳納方式，　應完全採取自繳方式，決不可效存款利息所得稅而採取扣繳方式，蓋客觀條件完全不聞故也。</p>
<h3>得慶生還的娘子軍伍長海斯汀司</h3>
<p>大谷上空失事焚毀的美軍運輸機內，有娘子軍八人，其中五個當塲慘死；廿四小時後，又有兩人喪命。海斯汀司，是八人中最幸運的一個。圖中的海斯汀司女士，滿面愁容，　首仰望着天，盼望祖國的飛機早些來把她救出。好身後的　　，是援救隊內的菲律濱隊員們臨時搭起來的。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>讀兪部長談財政計劃</h3>
<p>財政部部長兪鴻鈞氏日前來滬視察，曾對本報肥者發表談話，謂關於新外滙率問題，業經政府愼重研究，將考慮在振興及發展國際貿易之原則下，擬具妥善辦法，即可公布；對本年度之財政計劃，將側重於建設，而以復員善後爲中心，然本年度財政如整軍等支出，亦相當浩繁，現決設法整頓稅收，一面並擬利用國外物資，同時謀幣制與物價之穩定，俾預算接近平衡；關於省市地方財政問題，必先謀地方財政之充裕，中央決提高對於地方財政補助之數字，同時並擬重行劃分中央財政與地方財政之系列，以明各自之領域。此外，並就簡化直接稅手續。聯合國國際復興開發銀行等有關問題，亦有所闡述。上所云云，雖僅爲對新聞記者的談話，然簡單扼要，已多少明示了國家的財政方針。收復區的人民與中央施政，睽隔已久，河山光復之初，各方進行步驟，未必井然有序，對於他們本身利益有關的各項問題，如貨幣的價値，外滙率的重訂，納稅的負担，接收物資的運用，久望中央負責首長有所宣示。讀兪部長對報人所發表之談話，多少使他們明瞭一點中央對於財政的施政計劃，這於人民對於政府施政的認識上，是不無裨益的。</p>
<p>財政金融的問題是一切問題的癥結。抗戰勝利以來，鬧得最嚴重的，除政治問題外，在實際上還是一個財政經濟問題。近日收復區工潮的此起彼伏，雖然其間原因並不單純，主要也還是個財政經濟問題。在收復區裏的人民今日所感到的嚴重威脅，多半是財政經濟方面還沒有具體辦法，或雖擬有辦法而無即知即行的勇氣來執行。生活指數的提高，物價的騰貴，究其主因，也半由於幣値的未能穩定。因幣値的未能穩定，致影響到一般生活的動蕩。工潮的迭起，主要還是因爲工人工資所得的貨幣，不敷支應他們生活的費用。—這在實質上。多少仍是一個貨幣價値未能穩定的問題，如果貨幣—通貨—的價値還不能穩定下來。則一切社會經濟問題，都可以牽涉到財政問題上去。如果我們不先謀貨幣本身的善後復與，則一切善後復與也恐怕都談不上。這種情形，普遍地出現在經過戰爭後的各國。不僅今天的中國爲然。第一次世界大戰後的法國，德國，奧大利，意大利，都是如此；就是在第二次世界大戰後的各國，情形亦復相同。我國抗戰最久，所受的財政創傷亦最重，茲値戰後復員之際，首先需要善後復興的就是財政金融，而財政金融中首先應謀善後的就是國家所發的通貨，如何使通貨的價值能够穩定下來。必使通貨的價値能够穩定下來，然後社會的不安可以减輕，走上正常的道路，謀社希望，也是今天的財政政策所以最需要有遠見有魄力的人來毅然實施。兪部長對國際金融都市的上海，情形最熟。經過此番悉心考察，敢信必有高明的辦法。但辦法不僅要有「法」，而且必須「辦」，辦法才是可貴。</p>
<p>其次，收復區人民所感到另一脅迫的，是稅收系統的龐雜與稅捐負擔的加提。而其間最大的釁亂是中央與地方財政系統的未能明朗。在地方當局，有認爲中央獨占一切稅源，致使地方財政瀕於破產，故不得不自謀補救之道，於是攤派苛取，案件迭出，而人民與官府則交感其困。至明爲中央系統內之稅捐，其徵收稅率，近且迭有增加，以致收復區八年戰亂之餘，人民不堪負荷，怨聲時聞。收復區人民，望治八年，今河山重光，與民更始，對於財政上之攤派及稅荷，希望有合理之標準，以免擾民。</p>
<p>就國家的立塲，橫置在前之財政問題，主要還是收復區人民希望能做到的幾點。不過，在這以外，有的屬於財政組織上的問題，有的屬於政策上的問題。就組織上的間題來說，財政部的組織，其間有需切實調整之處。例如直接稅之設署，就彷彿像是一件多餘的事。直接稅旣爲國家稅收之一，似應與稅務署合併爲一，以節事功。再則目今的財政問題，旣是一個通貨問題，而關於金融事業的管理，日趨繁複，爲財政部主要業務之一，可是現今僅於部下設一錢幣司，而反無一獨立的單位，如國庫署，稅務署，關務署之類，負責處理，似不足以勝任。財政部之應專設管理貨幣及金融之機構，在今後實已急不容緩。</p>
<p>關於財政的政策問題，則有中央與地方財政之重劃，田賦的改征與糧食部的存廢間題，鹽政關稅等問題。地方財政的沒辦法，據說是所有稅源，多爲中央所占有。上海一市，據說，主要的稅收還是娛樂筵席稅，幾乎是支持市政的惟一稅收。甚至碼頭倉庫等也非市府所能過問，遑論其他？若果此說不虛，這裏顯有極大問題。娛樂筵席稅取諸於一般市民，何以在上海的大工廠大商行，他們得市政的惠特多，而對於市政的擔負却如此輕微？重新劃定中央與地方之財政系統，萬不可忽略租稅上「付稅能力」的原則，務使租稅的擔負能按納稅能力均等地落於一般納稅人的身上。</p>
<p>關於鹽政，引岸包商制度之必須取消，那是天經地義的事。不過，據說，其間辦法亦不一律。長蘆兩淮等地舊商，仍有取得類似變相之引岸制的特權，而兩浙却另行招致新商承包，這不知究爲何故？在對國家的供獻上，各地舊商，彼此多少相同，而在實際上，彼此所得的待遇却大有懸殊。國家變更鹽法，原有權衡，不過變則須澈底，應該明定制度，或則就場徵稅，不問所知，或則不採徵稅制，任人民自由買賣，亦都是辦法。像目下這樣表面上廢除引岸，而實際上仍有類似引岸制度的存在，不特國法不明，抑且破壞整個鹽政規模，影響國計民生，所關匪輕。</p>
<p>凡上所言、乃我們於讀了兪部長談話後的一點感想，願以　諸財政當局，亦不外野人獻曝的意思罷了。</p>

<h3>「聯總」支配救濟物資　中國所得比較最低　鄭寳南處長報吿工作概况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，本埠行政院善後救濟總署編譯處，於都城飯店招待記者，並請新近到滬之「行總」美京辦事處處長鄭寳南氏，出席報吿。</p>
<p>救濟物資運往靑島</p>
<p>沈處長先報吿日將派一美軍登陸艦，裝戲大批救濟物資赴靑島。以共重一千噸之麵粉，衣服，藥品，乳粉，等物，分配於山東省內共軍控制區械內之同胞。此次得用登陸艦運輸，係「聯總」署長凱塞向美陸海軍請求之結果，馬歇爾元帥，與魏德邁將軍，均極表同情</p>
<p>我國所得比較最低</p>
<p>沈氏旋即介紹鄭實南氏報吿，略謖「聯總」對我國之協助，為美金五萬六千二百五十萬元，即每一同胞可得美金一元二角五分，以人口平均分配而論，我國所得最低。希望聯總能予調整。鄭氏乃列舉各國所得之數目字，即前為敵國之奧義等國，所得亦較我國為多。分配欠當之原因：第一，或因「聯總」職員歡籍較多，對歐洲國家自不免偏重；第二，因「聯總」懷疑我國吸收此項物資之能力。實則「聯總」如能多多以水陸交通器具協助我國，則吸收與運輸二點，皆可不成問題。鄭氏又稱，彼將於下周赴豫湘等災情最重地區視察。</p>
<p>請求救濟三個原則</p>
<p>繼由沈處長與鄭氏分別答覆各記者提出之詢問，彙誌如下：（一）去年九月十九日，我國於倫敦曾向聯合國善後救濟會議中，要求九萬四千五百萬美元，但因其時決定對前為敵國之德奧等國亦予救濟，表示可以减至八萬萬元，但結果未能如願。（二）各國請求救濟，應依三個原則，即損失之大小，人口之多寡，停戰之情形。歐洲停戰，係逐步而來，英美駐軍於着着前進之際，對駐在國協助甚大。如以義大利而論，曾予以價值五萬萬元以上之救濟。我國因勝利突然而來，從未得到此種利益。（三）各國均有將「聯總」延期結束之意，我國則因戰事結束較歐洲遲三個月，故於明年三月底結束。此事於未來之聯合國救濟會議中可謀決定。中國希望再延長六個月。（四）我國租借英輪運輸救濟物資，國人頗多反對，實則此等船舶，係縣掛聯合國旗，英商只是一種服務。（五）至目前為止，「聯總」物資已來華者達三十一船，約十三萬五千噸，其中二十九船至上海，一船赴靑島，一船赴香港。</p>

<p>四個月來　收支數字</p>
<p>合法市稅收入，計去年九月份一個星期收一千六百四十四萬餘元，十月份收一億一千三百六十二萬元，十一月份收二億七千八百七十九萬餘元，十二月份收七億四千二百十餘萬元，本月份至廿四日止收七億一千三百九十餘萬元，共十八億六千四百八十五萬餘元，收數逐月增加，此僅係隨時改進征收方法，並未增加人民負擔。至支出方面，上年九月計五千六百八十七萬元，十月計十億〇七千九百六十五萬元，十一月計十二億七千八百四十二萬元，十二月計十四億九千二百十二萬元，共三十九億〇七百〇七萬餘元。前後收支相抵約計不足二十億〇四千二百二十二萬餘元。中央除撥開辦費及應急費警察冬季服裝費外，上年九月至十二月原屬國家部分預算之行政費生活補助費米代金等，尙未撥到。</p>

<h3>孫票刺激人心　金價逐步向上　美鈔隨金市進退</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因外埠金價報漲，人心復受「孫　」之刺激，業中大戶擬發動軋空局面，一度買風熾烈，惟美鈔實貨傾出，套頭拔開至六四〇元以上，金市有套賣頭寸供給，漲風尙難持久，銀根奇緊，午刻遭浮多殺出而轉微跌，晨開即升為九一萬五，買戶連綿而來，業中人亦聯袂爭購，開後步漲至九六萬左右，此際美鈔行市未見帶俏，遂引起套賣之風，雖有回小，惟中途極多掙扎，近午浮多殺出，午刻缺少銀根下，屈服於九四萬以下，午後現貨交易不多，隔日交割開時曾回升至九五萬三，美鈔續疲，影響人心，最後仍在九四萬五左右，結果與上週六相較，現貨漲三萬八，銀樓飾金掛高至十萬零二，紋銀八五〇元，銀元升為五三〇元，暗拆自一角至一角四分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔實貨源源殺出，戶在現鈔能否作結款用途之疑問下，裹足不前，晨開受金市刺激，升為一四六〇元，初尙盤旋，後受金市劇漲關係，引起套買（對黃金套價拔開至六四五元對十兩），步升至一四八〇元光景，人後金價回跌，午刻亦隨降至一四六〇元略强，午後續見小挫，實貨由錢兌業方面供過於求，結果較上週六好起十五元，港票初時受金市刺激，新老貨一致稍高，惟老貨因少投機性，較新貨未免遜色，但結果高價不能持久，與上週六相較新老均平。</p>
<h3>大戶施展做手公債又見漲風</h3>
<p>公債自經上週六業中逢低吸收後，已露待機而動之象，昨日報載「孫票」即將發行之訊，遂儘量利用，盡力哄抬，半眞半假狀態下，晨開丙種跌至一六五〇元，大戶連袂購買，軋空及做手雙管齊下，喊價竟一氣呵成，狂抬至一九五〇元以上，多頭遂滿意而止，再來一番脫手及放空，雙重壓力，一轉瞬慘跌四百餘元，退至一五〇〇元，此後出入紛繁，大戶及散戶觀感不一，先盤升至一八〇〇以上，午刻又迫於時間，降至一七〇〇元以內，結果較上週六計甲乙各升三一〇元，丙種三七〇元，丁種升三三〇元，戊種三七〇元。</p>
<h3>投機利用傳言華股節節進展</h3>
<p>華股在偽幣資本尙未全部整理之前，報載又有「孫票」行將發行之訊，不問消息來源如何，投機幫得此儘够利用，永紗晨開即抬高至一八〇〇元以上，美亞一二四〇〇元，但此際因風聲緊急，喊價時斷時續，入後銀根緊迫，　中復有一部脫收購金，準備結賬者，略有回跌，但中途多盤，永紗美亞均自高峯回小一百元光景，直至午收尙不脫盤旋，結果較上週六永紗美亞各漲一三〇元，信和中紡各好三十元，三小熱各漲一成左右，冷門各股亦因底價便宜，受人問津，續有進展。</p>
<p>外股受股債之刺激，被動而升，是以不若股債之燦爛，但過程則極端穩定，並無多大回風，直至午收較上週六計怡紗紙業等中小型各升二百餘元，會德豐以價巨成本較高，未能向榮，橡皮股則寥落。</p>
<h3>紗價又飛漲　紡建年內不拋售</h3>
<p>昨日紗市突飛猛進，　報章所露孫票傳說，入心為之大振，同行及散戶相繼狂吸，在各廠現貨奇缺之情况下，價乃靑雲直上，十六支二十支紗漲五萬，細紗升七八萬，午刻紡建公司宣佈年內不再開售，是以走勢益見挺秀</p>
<h3>配給原料太少　綢一致騰貴</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲塲外交易，一二〇號天橋現貨做價最高一百二十三萬元，最低一百二十萬元，棧單八十萬至八十一萬元，較週末漲起八九萬元，實因第一次配給原料數目太小，各廠不數應用，實銷尙有之故，廠經靜極思動，到貨成本激增，各檔一致提高，中級另担需價一百五十餘萬元，綢貨去路不寂，售價亦然跟進，美亞被面每百條八十五萬元，大誠格璧縐每碼二千八百元，民生織錦緞每件一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>棉花交易堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况尙堅，華商紗廠進四十二支原料美棉米得林花價六萬二千元，又三十二支原料三餘鎭細絨花價六萬三千五百元，以上均送廠價，花號進十六支原料火機花價四萬四千元，又周浦籽花開價九千元及九千二百元，以上均棧交價。</p>
<h3>棉布商矜持不放</h3>
<p>孫票發行消息駡傳於市，金價報漲於前，執貨者均存重貨輕幣之成見，矜持不放，益以成品存底籌碼稀薄，布市逎有冉冉上升之象。</p>
<h3>米糧猛漲　食油上升最劇</h3>
<p>米市以陰雨關係，且值歲暮，到源漸稀，店方因休市在即，均須備貨，故實消甚殷，致粳秈米均漲三四百元，麵粉亦因來貨稀少，零消轉暢，再漲三四百元，黃豆異常俏俐，續升五六百元，油市亦以年關店方備貨極衆，狂漲六七千元之巨，豆餅隨之跟漲一二百元，酒市堅穩。</p>
<p>米市塲明起休業　據米糧臨時市塲負責人聲稱，該市塲以年關已近，將於今日工作完畢后，須待農歷明春新正初五再行開始交易云。</p>
<h3>總結賬期將屆　茶市交易轉减</h3>
<p>民國三十四年度，工商各業總結賬期，轉瞬即屆，茶葉同業，亦須循例辦理一年來之營業賬目，是以賣買雙方，皆無意授受，惟間有成交者，亦係零星散戶需用現款者，藉資調節而已，乃交易寥寥無幾，市勢頗為平靜，行情缺乏顯著變動，依然呈穩定狀態，頃據天津帮消息，對於大方綠茶等，需求甚亟，大勢俟渡過農歷新年後，再行活動。</p>
<h3>煤市沉寂　柴炭歲莫非步軟</h3>
<p>煤市交易零　均寂，蓋時近歲尾，大部份煤商暫吿結束，且若無實銷去路，大多無意進貨，白煤塊實銷淸淡，行情續跌，白煤屑鋻於煤球暢銷，股實同業納胃甚　，行情反見挺俏，柴炭零星小販，因雨未能暢銷，而貨主急欲求現返鄕，祇可廉價脫售，但受主尙缺。</p>

<h3>京臨大收押學生有定明日開審說　王書林聲明未提私訴</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日專電〕臨大被押學生八人，法院有定期三十日開審說，該班主任王書林，京市靑年團書記黃通，曾請求法院提前開審，在押學生已絕食四日，聞此案可望從輕處結。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕京臨大覊押學生，地方法院定三十日開庭審理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕首都臨時大學補習班滋事被開除學生，經首都地方法院檢察處，認為有犯罪嫌疑，收押學生于柏靑等八人，業由檢察官偵察完畢，依照刑事訴訟法第一三六條，及三零二條之規定，以妨害公務及自由之條文提起公訴，檢察處職責吿一段落。以後即由法院刑庭推事依法辦理，雖經提起公訴，而有無犯罪之處，待法院開庭審判，目前尙難臆斷。被收押之學生八人，聞訊後即有絕食之表示，因此所謂一二一同學會之一部分同學，於廿五日未上課，代為奔走呼籲，請求釋放被捕同學。法院對此案，即將開庭審判。茲將向各方實際觀察及訪問情形，分誌於下：</p>
<p>學校方面</p>
<p>本報記者二十六日往臨大補習班時，見進門之兩面牆上，張貼被押學生于柏靑等八人之啓事，聲明絕食，籲請同學及社會人士援助。二十五日該班所謂一二一同學會之一部份同學，因此未上課，向外面奔走呼籲者以此。但參觀各敎室，大多數同學，均在上課。該班起初成立時，執其事者，以爲補習班，非常簡單，滿五十人開一班，課程旣屬補習性質，大致規定通常科目即可，不料後來學生人數加多，所有大學各院系科目齋備，為期甚迫，班主任從渝滬及內地羅致許多傑出敎授，（如前科學社著名學者孫洪芬，今適與記者相值，遂知渠担任該班化工系敎授），已煞費苦心。</p>
<p>敎授方面</p>
<p>據該班主任王書林談：前次學生滋事，固由於英文試卷，而最大要求，其來自僞中大學生，欲在此補習之後，一律分發正式中大讀書，坦白的說，如允許他們這種條件，無論如何吃苦將就，都不成問題。此事不但是敎部處理，無此辦法，卽中大本身，因以前校舍只能容二千人，現該　學生已增至四千五百人，已自感困難，亦不能說中大門關得很緊，不許人入，但次不是硬打硬關即可衝進去的。假如學生能在班十分用功，功課很好，此地敎授頗多在中大者，能感覺學生很好，主持公論，也許有挿入機會，我不能將本身不能做到的事，欺騙或敷衍學生，妄許學生　為可入中大，要在其好目為之耳。至於被押學生，他未做原告，未提起私訴，完全是檢察官以學生有妨碍公務及自由，認爲有犯罪嫌疑，由檢察官做原吿，提起公訴。王幷有函致法院，表示對學生寬大原諒，旣未控吿，自不便徇學生之請，用個人名義去保出學生，學生可自已想法，依法申請保釋。</p>
<p>敎部方面</p>
<p>據有關當局談：敎部對整頓學　，為敎育行政上之處理，做到開除學生之手續為止。學生因毆傷班主任被押，開庭審問，是法院法律問題，司法獨立，敎育行政，無權過問。至於要求保釋，自可由學生依法申請，經法院核定。</p>
<p>法院方面</p>
<p>首都地方法院汪院長，聞知被押學生有絕食之訊，特派書記官長涂懷禮，於廿六日上午十一時，往看守所慰問學生，說明汪院長關心靑年之意，此事當循法律軌道進行，卽將開庭　判，勸學生照常飲食，（一說學生並未絕食）幷謂絕食要求，太無意義，法院不負此項責任，亦次無因此稱要挾，可以左右案情之理。談話至二小時之久，學生亦表示看守所長對待靑年尙好之意，聞法院對此案卽將開庭，不日公開審判。照規在王主任有函致法院，表示寬大之意，與院方體念靑年盲從違犯法律之心理觀之，所謂法無可捨，情有可原，臆度審判從輕。大約於本月內二十日左右，即可開庭審判解次。幷聞是日先開一調查庭，先事研究然後三堂會　，（三位審判官同時出庭），以期妥愼周密云。（愚）</p>
<h3>浙省中等學校　復員近訊</h3>

<h3>廣西大學校長　李運華赴渝　爲復員問題向敎部請示</h3>
<p>〔本報桂林訊〕廣西大學校長李運華日前赴渝，據悉，此行目的有二：（一）該校學生名額本預定為六百人，近因交通恢復，各方前來者日衆，已超出千名，與原預算相差甚鉅，擬請敎部增撥經費。（二）桂林校舍大部被毀，重建非易，現雖在柳州開學，但校舍為竹篷所蓋，僅蔽風雨，故有人主遷梧州原址，此亦待敎部決定。（司）</p>

<h3>一九四五年十大良藥</h3>
<p>— 慕鳴</p>
<p>像選舉十大電影明星一樣，美國醫學會雜誌，最近特請各大醫師推選一九四五年的十種最重要的藥品，結果很有趣味。</p>
<p>現在先把一九一〇年的十種名藥列舉出來，作一個比較，從此可以見到三十五年來醫學進步的程度。一九一〇年的十大藥品也是由多數醫生所推選，其名位如下：</p>
<p>（一）醚，（二）嗎啡，（三）洋地黃，（四）白喉血淸，（五）牛痘苗，（六）鐵質，（七）奎寧，（八）碘，（九）酒精，（十）水銀。</p>
<p>由此表可見二十世紀初期的醫學家實在還很幼稚，遠不能與今日相比，而那時人類也遠不及我們那樣幸福安全，因為與疾病相鬥爭的武器太薄弱，生命　直沒有保障。</p>
<p>一九四五年十大藥品的皇位被靑黴素配尼西林奪得，這是地致公認，毫無疑問的。配尼西林這偉大的新發明實不愧稱為藥中之王，它對於人類的貢獻太大，醫藥史上從無此先例。磺醓胺類藥品也是光芒萬丈，不可一世，但配尼西靈發明後不免遜色，現在十傑表中把它們並列為一項，因為現代的新藥太多，各具優點，僅舉一種，不免有顧此失彼的遺憾，下面名位表中各項都以一個種類的藥品為單位：</p>
<p>（一）配尼西靈及其類似製品，磺醓胺類藥物。</p>
<p>（二）血液，血漿及血液製品。</p>
<p>（三）奎寧及人造治瘧藥阿的平。</p>
<p>（四）醚及其他麻醉藥；包括嗎啡，可開因，及各種安眠藥。</p>
<p>（五）洋地黃强心劑。</p>
<p>（六）六〇六類砒製劑。</p>
<p>（七）免疫製劑，包括各種疫萬及血淸。</p>
<p>（八）胰島素與肝膏。</p>
<p>（九）其他荷爾蒙（激素）。</p>
<p>（十）維他命。</p>
<p>這個表包括的藥品實在太複雜廣大，其中如免疫製劑，荷爾蒙，維他命都是近代醫學科學史中最燦爛的一頁，決不是僅僅一二種藥品所能代表，要安排出這樣一張表，可說已煞費苦心，但是實際上還有許多藥品雖名落孫山，其價值也是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>血液及其製品居然躍居亞軍，這是出人意外的，大概因戰爭時期輸血的遭遇過多，在應用方面血液的輸量一定很鉅，同樣，癮疾藥受到特別重視也是因爲戰爭多在熱帶地域進行（特別是美國南太平洋的戰爭），瘧疾的威脅遠非昔比。</p>
<p>醫學的突飛猛進，藥物的日新月異，確令人驚奇，試想維他命荷爾蒙這種名詞在一九一〇年時，簡直是聽不到看不見的，如今則已是家喻戶曉，婦孺皆知，預料今後的進步將更加速，十年之後如再選舉十大藥品，不知將有怎樣的變更呢。</p>
<p>節令</p>
<h3>「廢曆」與「費力」</h3>
<p>— 中戈一</p>
<p>儘管你政府頒令廢除農曆，然而「廢曆」還是好端端地存在看，決不會百分之百地被廢掉！當然，在表面上，我們已採用了陽曆，無論機關學校等等無不遵照陽曆辦事，但是陰曆的深入民間早經到了堅不可拔的程度，而絕不是一條政令能把牠從萬民的腦子裹輕易地「廢」去的！試瞧，為甚麼至今人們還是依據廢曆計算他們的生日呢？為甚麼到了廢曆新年，就有陽曆新年所沒有的一種熱閙呢？凡此都是無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>現在，不是又屆廢曆的新年了嗎？過年了！但是過年是多方面需要錢的；送禮，辦年貨，開銷苦力僕役，給「壓歲錢」……。錢，錢，錢。錢使新年成了一個畏途，一個大難關！不錯，在大老闆方面說，東也是官利，西也有花紅，今日這一個下屬孝敬鷄鴨，明日那一個下屬獻呈火腿，欣賞欣賞「新春巨獻」的好戲，嚐試嚐試數萬元一桌的「犧牲菜」，眞是「不亦樂乎」！但是在小職員，新水階級的一方面呢，是進益微薄得可憐而開支巨大得驚人，在在都使人覺得「捉襟見肘」，而年禮是非送不可，「極場面」也不得不「绷」！於是乎祗能一邊嘆氣，一邊勉强苦笑着去向人說「恭喜發財」！並且年關一屆，「窮人還債此其時也」，誰能跳出債主的手掌呢？好吧，再回過頭來看看物價如何；如何呢？難道你能否認物價是一貫地漲多！跌少嗎？眞所謂「窮人難過大年關」，「王小二過年，一年不如一年」了！</p>
<p>不假，要過一個「廢曆」新年，不由你不說一聲「費力」！———眞正「費力」！的確「費力」！實在「費力」！</p>
<p>要解決「費力」的問題，祇有一個辦法，就是把「廢曆」澈底地，根本地廢除掉！但是，要廢徐「廢曆」？事實上本是一件比過年更「費力」的事！</p>
<p>通訊</p>
<h3>重慶點滴</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>政協給了我們些什麼？停戰命令是否能促進和平？老百姓的嗓子都喊啞了，人民的希望，並不是想享受什麼舒適的生活。那怕日子再過得艱窘些，祇求能生存在有秩序的有代價的時光中。不要向着滅亡的路上走！</p>
<p>在某一次的政協代表演講會上，聽衆們曾掀動了一次不良好的舉動。他們反對這位代表的論調，竟「動武」了！雖然是無組織的無秩序的舉起了憤怒的拳頭，可是他們口中竟不約而同的喊出了；「蔣主席萬歲！中華民國萬歲！」這證實了正義是無法偽裝的！</p>
<p>留在山城的人們，對這行將來臨的春節，似乎都冷淡了對它的期望。大多數的人在勝利初臨的時候，對它的期望太美滿了，「回鄕度歲」的美夢。旣然無法實現，再加上道些時不愉快的情緒緾繞着，誰還能有那「聽爆竹聲聲，便引上眉梢喜」的過「年」的興趣呢？</p>
<p>中央公園在建築一塊鋼骨水泥的碑。是為紀念有功於抗戰的烈士們的。好吧！讓他矗立在這抗戰勝地的公園裏吧！吿訴這些活着的人們：「你們是為誰死的！」</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>功過之間</h3>
<p>— 談自由</p>
<p>這幾天，各地都在審漢奸了。十六日本報有兩段記載；一是在上海審判甘維露，一是在廣州審判陳鴻慈。這兩個寳貝各有各的醜態，同時，更申說自已已往的歷史。他們之所以說出來，歸根結底亦不過是希望大老爺額外開恩：宣吿無罪。</p>
<p>人到世界上來，應為民族，為國家為自己底宗族建立些事業，才不辜負來到世間的這一趟。這不是什麼值得驕傲的東西，這預是本份。像陳鴻慈甘維露之類，看看他們底過去，確屬不壞；但是現在呢？是漢奸。如果能把過去發揚廣大，該多麼的好。可是，他們落了水，造成了千古遺恨，不但汚辱了所有祖先底偉業，更黯淡了子孫底光榮！如今，他們還不肯伏罪，更異想天開地想拿過去的一點歷史，來「折」今日之罪。</p>
<p>兩個人在街頭對駡，我駡你麻皮，你駡我禿頂。雖然，大家所駡的，確都是對方的缺陷；但並不能因說中了對方底缺陷，就說自已底缺陷不是缺陷！說了別人底禿頭，並不能解釋自已底臉不麻！最多不過說，自已沒有這個缺陷。</p>
<p>一個人底以往的功績，我們不應隨便抹煞；但亦不能把這當作他日做壞事，賣國，犯罪的本錢，當作折罪的工具。</p>
<p>功和罪無論如何不能合併，像正負數似地相消。至少功與罪不在同時發生者應該如此。</p>
<p>你賣國了沒有，是審漢奸的目的。有，就得有罪；沒有，把沒有賣國的證據拿來！以往的功過，和今日有什關係？旣做漢奸了，委員長底親筆題贈的照片有什麼用？和什麼人同學又有什麼用？做了十多年的法官更有什麼用？</p>
<p>過去的歷史是有用的，但他祇是給我們做今日的借鏡，是鼓舞我們向上，督促我們為善的工具。有那末好的過去，不好好地發揚光大，已是『罪甚罪甚』了。如今賣了國，還想拿過去來折罪，偏生世界上亦有這種嘴吧來說！</p>

<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>有許多人眼睛並不瞎，然而他的『心靈的眼睛』却是瞎的。因為從他心靈裏透露出來的不是光明，而是黑暗。心靈是一個人身心的主宰，應該時常保特純潔淸淨，如稍稍蒙上一些灰塵，那不啻遮蔽整個「心靈的眼睛』。</p>
<p>一個人的眼睛瞎了，並不是十分可悲的事。愛倫凱女士說：『盲人並不是可以認爲最缺憾的，因為視覺器官的缺陷，能從各方面設法去謀補救。』這話是很對的，近世的科學文明，已經給肓人帶來許多幸福，肓人學校的種種新設施，解決了盲人的閱讀和學習的困難，盲人照常可以閱報，奏樂，接受外界的刺激，喚起生命的動力。世界上有不少盲人，在黑暗中奮鬥成功，我到了人生的光明面。</p>
<p>據近世心理學家的研究，肓人的學習能力，往往超過常人。有人說盲人的智力比普通不盲人高，這並未盡然。何林渥斯說：『肓人的記憶力有時確超越於當人，這是一種補償作用，視覺的缺陷由其他方面來補償。』一般地說，盲人因為失明的原故，不很容易受到外界視覺的紛擾，心總比較靜些，而思想也比較集中，學習能力自然要高得多了。</p>
<p>所以我覺得盲人的眼睛雖然不能看見外蜀的事物，但『心靈的眼睛』或許要明這亮得多。許多盲音樂家，他們能够奏出心之深處的衷曲，而感動無量數的人，或者不是沒有原因吧？</p>
<p>可悲的是社會上有許多人，眼睛不但不盲，而且迎淺度的近視都沒有，目光銳利，眼力很強，但心地却絲毫不光明，思想和行為，都卑劣不堪，腐惡不堪，令人發生『臭水溝裹的渣滓』之感。這種人縱眼睛是光明的，而心地却黑暗無比。腦筋昏沈沈的，思路呆滯得像枯木，一天到晚在胡胡塗塗中混過去，生活對於這般人『心靈的盲人』成為毫無意義的吃飯睡眠一類的事。他們自己也覺得日子過得沒有意思，人生本來是充滿着希望的，他們說沒有希望，只有沮喪與消極，前途本來是光明的，但他們說沒有光明，只有黑暗與沈鬱。其實展開在我們面前的是無限的希望和光明，但是他們的『心靈的眼睛』早已肓了，一塊大翳蒙在上面，自然望不見希望和光明了。</p>
<p>要希望社會進化，文化發展，我們就得使『心靈的眼睛』放出光明來。我們必定要求生活的改進與向上，增進人生對於個體與社會的積極的意義，使我們的生活都成為有目的的，自覺的，把心理上的一切陰翳除掉，不但要保持身體的健康，還要力求心理的健康。革除一切不良的心理。我們的『心靈的眼睛』若看不明白，我們就應立刻設法醫治。</p>
<p>放開我們的眼睛去看外面這個動的世界，要看得遠大些，淸楚些。放開我們『心靈的眼睛』，去思維，體察，認識，批判我們的生活，要從自覺中提高我們生活意義，矯正一切心理上的病態！</p>

<h3>Adjustment Work Can Enter Smooth Path; Resumption of Transportation Under Discussion; Conflicts in Jin-Cha-Sui-Ji Have Ceased</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 28th] The adjustment work for military conflicts by the Adjustment Department seems to be entering a smooth path and gradually entering the stage of consultation on the resumption of transportation. On the extremely complex diplomatic and internal affairs issue of Chifeng, the government made a major concession. A tripartite agreement was reached late last night, and the Fifth Communiqué was immediately released, denying that General Du Yuming had been ordered to occupy Chifeng. It also declared that the Executive Headquarters ordered the national and communist armies at all levels to comply with the ceasefire order, remaining at the locations before midnight on January 13, 1946, and ordered that no army of either side should enter Chifeng to take over the defense zone after the withdrawal of the Soviet army. This communiqué took effect from 7:00 AM on the 27th. An official familiar with the inside story pointed out to the reporter that this was a major concession by the government in its effort to seek peace. The reason is that China and the Soviet Union had agreed that in the Chinese area north of 28 degrees north latitude, after the Soviet army completed its surrender acceptance and withdrew, it would be defended by the National Government army. Therefore, it was justified for the National Army to go to take over the defense. In terms of ceasefire measures, the Soviet army only began to withdraw on the 23rd, and the Communist army had not occupied Chifeng before midnight on the 13th, so it was even more appropriate for the National Army to enter after the Soviet army withdrew. However, in order to achieve peace, the government made a major concession and agreed not to let the National Army enter. The Communist side explained that the Communist Party had already carried out underground activities in the area during the Anti-Japanese War and established local governments and troops after the victory. If the National Army obeyed the ceasefire order, it would not enter the city. Fortunately, the matter has been resolved because of the tripartite agreement that neither army will enter the city. However, whether the security team currently stationed in the city belongs to the neutral side or the Communist side and whether it can continue to stay will be a noteworthy issue. According to the reporter's information, the Executive Headquarters of the Adjustment Department has been actively discussing the issue of resuming transportation in the past two or three days, but the discussion does not seem to have made much progress. The transportation authorities told reporters today that all expenses, equipment, and labor related to the resumption of transportation have been fully prepared, waiting only for the consent of the Communist Party. This is somewhat like "everything is ready except for the east wind." They also told reporters that the personnel responsible for repairing roads in Anyang, Baotou, and other places had requested the Communist army to allow them to start repairing roads, but the Communist army refused on the grounds that it had not received orders. People from the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters believe that the implementation of restoring transportation involves extremely complex issues such as equipment, personnel, and road protection, which require lengthy discussions, and specifically stated their desire for "railway neutralization." It is generally judged that to quickly restore transportation, not only the mediation of the US personnel is needed, but also the participation of the US technical personnel.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The military adjustment enforcement department sent teams to various places to implement the ceasefire order, which has come to an end. Today, it began to deal with the second issue of restoring transportation. The three committees and staff members are discussing the starting method day and night at the headquarters of Xiehe Hospital. The Communist Party advocates that the restoration of transportation should include all transportation such as railways, waterways, highways, and postal communications. The central government said that all transportation should be opened as soon as possible, but railway transportation is most needed, so it should be restored first. This kind of dispute occurred during the Chongqing negotiations last autumn and has not been resolved today. The Communist side also requested that once the transportation lines are restored, it should be guaranteed that they will not be used to assist in the war, which shows that the mutual suspicion has not been completely eliminated. The third thing that the adjustment enforcement department should deal with is the issue of disarming the Japanese army. Both sides agreed not to proceed for the time being. The 1,200 Japanese troops on the Jiaoji Railway are temporarily allowed to continue to carry firearms.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rehe, Chifeng Airport, 28th] US Navy flight personnel, carrying orders and supplies from the headquarters of the military adjustment enforcement, contacted the three-person supervisory group that had been stranded in Chifeng for ten days this afternoon. Two US transport planes they were driving, carrying Communist Commander Duan Suyuan (transliteration) from Chengde, the Communist headquarters in Rehe, flew to the airport here. Duan carried orders that the Communist army in the Chifeng area should allow the supervisory group or the Americans performing liaison work to pass freely without obstruction.</p>
<h3>Fengzhen Talks Reach Agreement on Equipment; Unarmed Soldiers Can Enter Each Other's Individual Territories</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The military adjustment enforcement department issued a joint communiqué today, stating that according to the report from the enforcement team sent to Datong, the conflicts between the national and communist armies in northern Shanxi, southwestern Chahar, southeastern Suiyuan, and western Hebei have now completely stopped. Representatives of the enforcement team and the commanders of the two armies held talks in Fengzhen and have now reached an agreement, which includes the following six points:</p>
<p>(1) The troops of both sides withdrew to the locations where they were stationed before midnight on January 13, that is, before the ceasefire agreement took effect.</p>
<p>(2) Both sides issued notices and published statements in newspapers, stating that trade can be resumed between cities in the ceasefire zone, and it has already been restored in the Datong area.</p>
<p>(3) Both sides sent liaison officers to each other, which is in progress.</p>
<p>(4) Unarmed soldiers of both sides can freely enter each other's occupied areas, and this action has already begun.</p>
<p>(5) Immediately release all prisoners.</p>
<p>(6) Thoroughly search the entire area, collect all rails, trains, sleepers, telephones, and wires in the area, and place them near the railway lines for proper preservation.</p>
<p>(The railways in the above-mentioned ceasefire zone include the Zhengtai Railway and the Tongpu Railway).</p>
<p>In addition, the Executive Department also announced the expansion of the enforcement team, planning to establish eight new teams equipped with full radio equipment, and another fifteen teams equipped with light radio equipment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The executive team of the Adjustment Department sent to Datong reported by wireless telegraph today that the team is holding talks with the national and communist generals in Fengzhen, and the situation is satisfactory. The Communist general is General He Long, the commander of most of the Communist army in Shanxi Province, and the National Army is General Zhu Xichuan, the commander of the northern Shanxi region. Chiefs of staff and senior generals from both sides are present.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 28th] It is heard that the military adjustment enforcement department has paid great attention to the military conflicts near Haizhou and the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu. It has ordered the Xuzhou team to go to Donghai nearby. After the Jin-Xu two enforcement teams complete their tasks, they will go south along the Jinpu Railway. At that time, a northern Jiangsu team may be established.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanzhou, 27th] From the 25th to the 27th, there was no gunfire in Yanzhou for three days and nights. People's hearts are gradually at ease. Colonel Dike and others invited Railway Commissioner Wang Yongrong and others to discuss the restoration of transportation.</p>
<h3>Six Telegraph and Telephone Trunk Lines to Be Completed in Short Term</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming, Our Newspaper, 27th] According to people in the transportation industry, the Ministry of Communications has decided to complete the construction of six national telegraph and telephone trunk lines in the shortest possible time. These six lines are the Jin-Jing Line, the Jing-Han Line, the Ping-Han Line, the Hu-Han Line, the Yu-Han Line, and the Yue-Han Line. After the completion of this work, it can be connected with branch lines in various places, so that the communication of reports and telephones in the recovered areas and the rear can be restored.</p>
<h3>Population of Yan'an Decreases; Communist Headquarters Have No Intention of Leaving Ting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 28th] The population here once increased from 20,000 to 60,000 during the war. Since the Japanese surrender, it has gradually decreased. The current number may not exceed 30,000. Most of those who left are students and small industrial workers, mostly going to larger cities such as Zhangjiakou and Chengde. There were rumors that the Communist headquarters would also move from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou. The reporter asked Zhu De about this yesterday. He replied that he had no intention of leaving Ting'an for the time being, and then said with a smile, "If the consultation is satisfactory, then we may go to Nanjing one day, which is also unknown."</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Arrives in Xi to Inspect Troops Stationed in Various Places</h3>

<p>[This Newspaper, Kunming, 27th Dispatch] According to General Chennault, he plans to stay in Kunming for five more days before flying to Chongqing, and the previous intention to go to Shanghai from Kunming has been changed. Furthermore, after General Chennault arrived in Kunming from Chongqing on the 18th, he rarely attended social occasions. Every morning after breakfast, he and Mr. Wei Laoer, Director of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act in China, would drive to various places near Kunming to hunt wild animals, and they have had considerable success in recent days. At midnight on the 25th, the doors and windows of the General's bedroom were not locked, and a madman suddenly broke in, claiming to be delivering a gift. Upon inspection, it turned out to be broken old buttons and books. It is said that this madman was originally a student at the Southwest Associated University who became mentally disturbed due to a broken love affair. He spoke with General Chen in English for quite some time, and Mr. Chen advised him to return to his native Guangdong Province and not wander around Kunming City. Later, Colonel Shu Boyan, General Chen's old translator, arrived upon hearing the news and persuaded the mad scholar to leave. The next day, Mr. Chen gave 2,000 yuan in legal tender to this nocturnal visitor who delivered the gift.</p>
<h3>"China in the Sun" - New Book Published</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, New York, 27th] Literary critic Garnett described Randall's new book, "China in the Sun," in detail in the book review column of the New York Herald Tribune on the 24th. Garnett commented: "The author of 'China in the Sun,' Randall, has now returned to China to restore the publication of the Shanghai Great America Evening News, which was suspended in 1941 due to interference from the Japanese. Mr. Randall is a native of Minnesota, USA. Since going to China in the spring of 1924, he has spent most of his time in China. His writings on China have a consistent significance, which is lacking in the writings of others who claim to be familiar with the situation in China. He said that China has been in the process of revolution for the past 30 years, and the current dispute between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party is, in his personal view, just another chapter in a long history. He believes that the best way to understand China is to compare it with the United States in the 18th century, when the provinces of the United States were deeply divided and transportation facilities were still in their infancy. This book is the best work on the history of 20th century China. The intimate tone and rich materials in the book are particularly characteristic."</p>

<h3>Security Council Receives First Test - Tense Atmosphere at Yesterday's Meeting - Iranian Representative Requests the Soviet Army Be Ordered to Withdraw by a Deadline - Decision on Iran's Appeal Postponed Until Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 28th: The Security Council, the cornerstone of the entire United Nations organization, faced its first major test this afternoon regarding whether it could serve as an international arbitrator. The Council formally permitted Iran to present its complaint against the Soviet Union, and the atmosphere was tense with a packed public gallery. After the meeting began, the issue of Albania's request to join the United Nations was discussed for an hour. Finally, it was resolved to include Albania's application on the agenda. Subsequently, the chief Soviet representative spoke, advocating for an immediate discussion of the Iranian issue, but the Assembly decided to postpone it until Wednesday. Security Council Chairman Makin proposed that the Iranian representative be allowed to participate in the Security Council meeting when discussing the Iranian complaint and asked the representatives if they objected to this suggestion. At that time, all representatives turned their attention to the chief Soviet representative, Vishinsky. Since no representatives raised objections, the Iranian representative, Taikizadeh, took a seat, only six feet away from Vishinsky. The Iranian representative stated that the Iranian government had sent several diplomatic notes to the Soviet government, requesting permission for Iranian troops to enter Azerbaijan, but the Soviet government had neither denied nor responded. The Iranian representative said that this dispute was regrettable because Iran was originally an ally of the Soviet Union, and Iran had contributed to the Soviet Union's victory. Finally, the former Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi's plan to go to Moscow was also rejected, so Iran had no choice but to file a complaint with the Security Council. The Iranian representative also pointed out that the Soviet Union interfered in Iran's internal affairs, violated the Tehran Agreement, and warned that if Iran could not freely deploy troops within its own country, there might be tragic consequences. Thereupon, the Iranian representative requested that the Soviet army withdraw from Iranian territory by March 2nd and requested the Security Council to pass this request.</p>
<p>[United Press, Iranian Capital, 28th] The new Iranian Prime Minister, Shadanah, announced today that he had instructed Shah Taai, the head of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, to discuss Iran's complaint against the Soviet Union with Vishinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation. Shah Taai was Prime Minister during the Tehran Conference and is a friend of Vishinsky, fluent in Russian.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] News from Tehran last night reported that Iranian Prime Minister Shadanah had issued a new instruction to the Iranian delegation in London, but as of four hours before the United Nations Security Council meeting this afternoon, the Iranian delegation had not yet received this new instruction. Iran's complaint against Soviet interference in its internal affairs is on the agenda of the Security Council this afternoon.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Agenda Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The United Nations Security Council held its second session today to discuss issues such as Soviet interference in Iran and the stationing of British troops in Greece and East India, which "threaten world peace." Albania's application for membership will also be discussed, and later the refugee issue will be discussed, which is related to the initial discussion of the financial problems of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, the United Nations General Assembly received a memorandum of 10,000 words from New York, pointing out that the Argentine government is still a dictatorial regime, with aggressive intentions, and undermines all obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, advocating for the exclusion of Argentina from the United Nations organization. Therefore, Argentina's application for membership may not be discussed at this session. The General Assembly agenda is nearing completion, and the outstanding issues that have not yet been discussed include the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization and 15 judges of the International Court of Justice. Judging from the progress of the meeting, the small countries have fared better than expected. During this time, the Arab League and most Latin American countries led the struggle for the interests of small countries. Most small countries initially feared that the five great powers had already gained control in the Security Council and would also gain the same power in the General Assembly, so they tried their best to fight, unanimously insisting that the General Assembly vote must be decided by a majority vote to weaken the position of the great powers in the meeting. This move has already been achieved.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Begin Drafting Treaty with Italy - France, United States, and Austria Request Border Revisions - Soviet Union Seeks Trusteeship over Libya</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said that representatives of the foreign ministries of various countries are drafting the draft treaty with Italy. The British representative has proposed a plan to establish Italian colonial trusteeship, suggesting that Italy's colonies be temporarily handed over to the four powers drafting the treaty, namely Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, pending the completion of the entire United Nations organization's trusteeship plan. The representatives of the four powers are busy sorting out the many outstanding issues left over from the foreign ministers' meeting last autumn, so the British proposal cannot be considered for the time being. In addition, the Soviet Union insists on obtaining sole trusteeship over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. Soviet representative Gusev is waiting for instructions from Moscow, and there is no way to discuss this trusteeship issue until he receives them. In the past one or two weeks, Britain and the United States have had requests to obtain sole trusteeship over African colonies and Pacific islands. Therefore, the Soviet Union is unwilling to lag behind and intends to claim the same rights over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its opinion on the Dodecanese Islands, which is a matter of great concern to all parties. It is said that the Soviet Union has also supported Yugoslavia's claim to the port of Trieste. In addition, there is the issue of reparations. Britain, the United States, and France believe that Italy should not and cannot afford to bear reparations. France's demands on Italy seem to have decreased compared to the foreign ministers' meeting last autumn. France still demands to acquire Brigas and Tenda on the Italian border, but no longer demands to acquire Val d'Aosta in northwestern Italy and the area near Lake Chad in southern Libya. The strongest advocate for acquiring Italian territory was De Gaulle, and De Gaulle's departure should ease France's attitude.</p>
<h3>Romanian and Bulgarian Issues - Britain and Soviet Union Reach Understanding</h3>

<h3>Relationship Between Britain and Soviet Union - Presents Abnormal State - Security Concessions Made by Britain to the Soviet Union - Fails to Obtain Corresponding Compensation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said: When the British Foreign Secretary sat next to the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs at an international conference, he actually said that he was tired of the accusations against the Soviet government, which shows that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union, or Britain's traditional foreign policy, has undergone some unexpected events. At the same time, British newspapers used terms such as "political deception," "untrustworthy behavior," and "malicious and boring actions" to describe Soviet propaganda and foreign policy, which can also indicate the abnormal state of the relationship between the two countries. The British have indeed become tired of it. They feel that the privileges demanded by the Soviet Union are those that the Soviet Union itself is unwilling to grant to others, and the security concessions given by Britain to the Soviet Union have failed to obtain corresponding compensation. Britain has not objected to the Soviet Union's demands on the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, East Prussia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, but when Britain advocates maintaining closer relations with Western European countries or implementing its security policies in Southern Europe or the Middle East, Moscow expresses firm opposition. The British feel that the situation they are facing is as follows: Britain, with a population of 45 million, is being asked by the Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million and the world's largest land army, to recognize the alliances it has made with neighboring governments as security measures, while Britain is not allowed to have other security arrangements besides relying on the United Nations mechanism. In this situation, there are four possible paths that Britain can take: (1) Trust the Soviet Union's goodwill and let it do as it pleases; (2) Restore the balance of power policy and not allow only one strong power to exist on the European continent; (3) Rely on the United Nations organization; (4) Improve the United Nations Charter, so that the powers either obey the constraints of United Nations law, or confront the combined forces of all countries, and also use the Western European regional agreement as a backup for the United Nations organization. In the current situation, no British government would dare to trust the Soviet Union's good intentions, and neither Britain nor the United Nations organization can easily take action against the aggression of a certain power. Because the British government fears the Soviet Union and is still unable to determine its constitution, it is most likely that British foreign policy will take the fourth path mentioned above. The true balance of power policy is for the united countries to take concerted action against belligerent countries. Representatives of various countries attending the General Assembly expect that the unstable international situation will hopefully stabilize somewhat after the peace treaty is signed, and the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union may improve.</p>
<h3>Former British Cabinet Member - Accuses Labor Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Former British Conservative Party cabinet member Macmillan today accused the Labor government, saying: Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the friendly relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has gradually decreased, and it is not as close to the United States as it used to be. It was previously claimed that after the Labor Party came to power, British-Soviet relations could be improved immediately, but today, the friendly relationship between us and our old allies is under serious threat.</p>

<h3>Viceroy Wavell Addresses Indian Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] Viceroy Lord Wavell delivered the shortest Governor-General's address in history to the Indian Central Legislative Assembly today, saying that the British government is determined to establish an executive council composed of political leaders and organize a constitutional assembly as soon as possible. I cannot discuss the organization of these institutions in detail at this time, nor can I explain how to overcome the various difficulties, nor is it convenient to determine the date on which India will gain freedom. I can only assure you that these matters will be the first things the governments in London and New Delhi will do. The Viceroy added that some of you may wish to vote against the government's measures, and it is up to you to decide whether or not to do so. But I believe that legislation is in the interest of all the people of India, and it would be short-sighted to hinder or delay it.</p>
<h3>London Public Assembly - Demands India Be Granted Independence - And Sympathizes With Struggle for Liberation in East India and Vietnam - Marches to Government After Meeting to Petition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Indian League held a demonstration against British policies in India and Indonesia at Trafalgar Square here yesterday, with over 2,000 participants. The police were stationed at various key points to maintain strict vigilance. The flags of the Congress Party were planted all around the Nelson Monument, and speakers spoke from the base of the monument. Member of Parliament from Manchester, Dr. Johnson, first gave a speech, saying that the people of London represented, this an opportunity to express profound sympathy for the independence movements in Java, Vietnam, and India. The venue was equipped with loudspeakers, and the colorful costumes of Indian women were a beautiful addition to the conference.</p>
<p>A banner with the slogan "Reap the Complete Victory" was hung on the pillar of the venue. Member of Parliament for Wales, Mr. Goff's speech warned the government to prepare to deal with the backlash from the firing in Bombay. His speech said that although the Labor government was supported by me, if it continues to implement imperialist policies, it will have to use imperialist methods. I really don't want to see the Labor government go down this path. By this time, the mood at the venue had gradually become tense. Mr. Goff then said, "You should support this mission. Please protect the freedom of the people of the East." Indian Communist candidate Dutt also said, "We are meeting here not only for the interests of the people of India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, but also for your interests. We cannot allow our personnel to participate in actions that interfere with the freedom struggle of other nations." The conference passed two resolutions, namely, demanding independence for India and demanding that the British government recognize the independence of Indonesia. After the meeting, the crowd marched, following Government Buildings to the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office to submit the resolutions, with mounted police leading the way, followed by Indian students holding the Congress Party flag high. Indian League Secretary Menon and British Members of Parliament Goff and Hutchinson. There were young girls, old women, veterans of both World Wars, British officers and soldiers, Dutch sailors, American pilots, and three Indian soldiers in the marching column. As the clock at Whitehall struck four, the procession set off. While the leaders entered the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office, the others stood in front of Government Buildings, shouting slogans and jeering. The procession then returned to Trafalgar Square. Chairman Hutchinson told the crowd: "We have complied with the order to submit the resolutions to the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office. A Foreign Office staff member left a message saying that Foreign Secretary Bevin had been invited out, but would read the resolutions within an hour and consider them. There was no one in charge at the Indian Affairs Office. India is in deep water, but the place that handles Indian affairs, except for one person who has nothing to do with the Indian Affairs Office, no one else. We have to leave the resolution to that person to immediately forward to the Indian Affairs Minister. Both resolutions will be considered and answered, and the reply will be published in the newspaper or announced at a public gathering here again. Now that we have submitted the resolutions, the meeting that is being held will be talked about by the people in India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and they will know that the British people are supporting their struggle for freedom." The crowd then donated 2,000 rupees to fund the Indian League to show their practical sympathy for Indian goals. The procession was a quarter of a mile long. When passing the monument, the Indian national flags held were all slanted to pay tribute to those who died in the two World Wars, and the spectators along the way were numerous.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Lawyer - Advocates Revising Civil Code</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] One of Japan's eleven female lawyers, Miss Watanabe Michiko, gave a radio speech last night, pointing out that the Japanese Civil Code, enacted in 1897, "is full of feudal ideas."

She said that Japanese women are listed as quasi-incapable persons, and all important actions must be approved by their husbands. Only if the wife has no children can she inherit her husband's property. She also said that Japan's marriage law favors men and is unfavorable to women. She advocated the appointment of a committee to revise the Japanese Civil Code and allow women to participate in the committee.</p>

<h3>Testing the Atomic Bomb: Records and Inferences</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 27th] United States Army and Navy experts are preparing to use a fleet as the target to test the power of the atomic bomb. To date, only three atomic bombs have been used. The first was tested in New Mexico for the first time, and the other two were used to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Based on these three experiences, experts have gathered information from all parties and obtained the following records or inferences: (1) At the instant of the bomb's explosion, the initial pressure reached hundreds of thousands of pounds per square inch, followed by winds with speeds of 500 to 1,000 miles per hour. Although brief, the force was extremely strong, as speeds exceeding 75 miles per hour are commonly referred to as gale-force winds. (2) When tested on the sea surface, it will generate waves ranging from low to 100 feet high. (3) At the center of the so-called "fireball," the temperature can reach 100 million degrees Fahrenheit. As the heat wave spreads outward from the center, the heat will decrease sharply, but it will still possess immense destructive power. According to reports from American scientists, people within a mile of the bomb's detonation point, even if not killed by "mechanical force," will be burned to death or severely injured. A large amount of radiation is also emitted during the bomb's explosion. This type of radiation, like a bell, reached Hiroshima and Nagasaki with enough power to affect blood cells even if the skin appeared unharmed, causing blood to seep out and flow into internal cavities. American military officers and scientists believe that this radiation did not have much residual power in the two attacks on Japan because the bombs were detonated in the air, and the radiation dissipated very quickly, not lingering on the ground. However, some scientists speculate that if the bomb were detonated closer to the ground, as planned for this test, it could leave behind a large amount of radioactive material equivalent to several tons of radium. Due to this threat, nearby islands in the test area may be affected by radioactive waves or cloud fragments. Therefore, as a precaution, islanders must be evacuated to prevent accidents. Some house walls in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although directly bombed, remained standing because the pressure was directed downwards, but roofs and floors were shattered. Regarding the impact on steel-framed buildings, some clues were obtained in Nagasaki, where the Mitsubishi torpedo factory was completely disintegrated due to the pressure. During this test, responsible personnel refused to disclose how the fleet would be arranged, only stating that some battleships would be placed at the center of the bomb's detonation point and spread over a large area, loaded with automatic recording instruments to study various degrees of damage.</p>

<h3>The World Watches: The Direction of the U.S. Congress</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th] The people of the United States and the world will closely watch the U.S. Congress's handling of the U.S. loan to Britain for the following reasons: (1) The strength demonstrated by the opposition will have a significant impact on the U.S. government's procedure for lending to foreign countries this year. This procedure is currently awaiting approval of credit to Britain to determine its future. (2) The course of action that the U.S. Congress will take in handling affairs can be seen from this debate. (3) This will demonstrate whether the U.S. Congress's dissatisfaction with President Truman's domestic agenda will extend to Congress's attitude toward the president's foreign relations and international cooperation policies. (4) This will show whether the United States is rapidly moving into a new isolationism. The loan to Britain may encounter more dangerous and significant opposition in both the House and Senate, but the U.S. government anticipated this and has prepared measures to deal with it.</p>

<p>[United Press Chicago, 27th] Meatpacking workers belonging to the two major U.S. labor unions went on strike to demand increased wages. The government took over the canneries on Saturday and Sunday. It is now heard that 248,000 workers will resume work on Monday, and deliveries can begin on Wednesday. The government also expressed optimism about other labor strikes today.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] A senior government official predicted on Sunday evening that the steel industry strike could end within a week. It is said that this news came from sources close to those in charge of the government's labor policy, but it cannot be fully verified. The strength of those hoping for an early resolution of the steel industry strike, which has lasted for a week, has greatly increased since the resolution of the Ford and Chrysler auto strikes. It may gain an advantage within a week, and there may be other pressures that can lead to victory. Although the White House does not intend to intervene in the next three or four days, there are many changes and uncertainties. The general strike in the steel industry began at midnight on January 20th, involving 800,000 workers in 1,292 factories in 30 states, making it the largest strike in the history of the U.S. steel industry. Although President Truman made every effort to mediate and try to get the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the U.S. Steel Corporation to reach a compromise, it ultimately failed. Only Kaiser, the president of the West Coast steel plant, accepted the president's proposal and agreed to increase wages by 18.5 cents per hour. The steelworkers' union initially demanded an increase of 23 cents per hour, but the employers only agreed to an increase of 12.5 cents. After repeated negotiations, the union agreed to reduce the demand to 19.5 cents per hour, but the employers would only increase by 14 cents at most. The negotiations broke down on January 19th, and a general strike was implemented from midnight on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Request to Amend the Treaty, Britain Replies to Egypt</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 28th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that Britain has delivered a reply to the Egyptian ambassador regarding the Egyptian letter of December 20, 1945, concerning the amendment of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. The reply expresses sympathy for the letter and is preparing to announce the letters of both sides simultaneously with the Egyptian government. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of the date and method of amending the treaty will be jointly reviewed by both parties. It is heard that Egypt is eager to modify the status of Sudan and have British troops withdraw from Egyptian territory. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty, drafted in 1936, only allows British troops to be stationed in the canal zone outside of wartime, so the withdrawal of British troops from most parts of Egypt can be discussed separately from the main conditions issue.</p>
<p>[United Press Cairo, 28th] Three Egyptian cabinet members resigned yesterday in anger because the government did not submit the issue of Egyptian independence and the withdrawal of British troops to the United Nations General Assembly. Their resignations have now been withdrawn, and the Egyptian political crisis has subsided.</p>
<h3>The United States Creates a New Type of Bomber: Unparalleled in Speed and Power</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] The Navy announced today a powerful new dive torpedo bomber that will be carried on the Midway-class super aircraft carrier. It has a maximum range of over 1,700 miles and can dive vertically at a speed of over 500 miles per hour, using a 4,000-pound bomb or rocket or torpedo and a 2,000-pound bomb rocket to attack targets. This new bomber is called the BTM Moller and was designed and manufactured by the Martin Company of Baltimore, specifically for new giant aircraft carriers. The flat flight speed exceeds 350 miles per hour. When not carrying bombs, it weighs 17,500 pounds, which is 1,000 pounds more than the current similar aircraft. This aircraft is equipped with a special brake that can reduce the maximum vertical dive speed of over 500 miles per hour to within 350 miles per hour, so the bombing is more accurate. Its wing-mounted dive brake can be released in five seconds at extremely high speeds. The aircraft is equipped with the world's largest aircraft engine, with 3,000 horsepower. Its Curtis four-blade electric propeller is 14 feet 8 inches in diameter. The aircraft is 50 feet wide, 41 feet 8 inches long, and the wings are box-shaped, with the outer wing sections folded vertically for easy carrier deployment. The aircraft is equipped with four 28mm guns, and the bombs, rockets, and torpedoes it carries are suspended outside.</p>

<h3>New Developments in the History of Exploration in New Guinea: The U.S. Air Force Discovers the Baliem Valley, Where Curly-Haired Savages Have a Unique Way of Life; Translated by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper from the December Issue of National Geographic Magazine</h3>
<p>"Colonel, go over the ridge and you can enter the deep canyon that leads to the hidden valley."</p>
<p>These words came from the intercom wireless telephone as I was flying a C-60 Star aircraft in a curved line reconnaissance over the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level in the interior of New Guinea. The sky was full of holes. The person who told me this was my training pilot, Sergeant Griml.</p>
<p>A week ago, he discovered the hidden valley of New Guinea when he flew around, searching for a relatively low mountain path in the steep mountains of the Orange Mountains. The existence of this hidden valley was not revealed to the world until 1938 by the Archbold Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History. This is only the second time that white people have come to this mile-high, walled-off deep valley. Later, we learned that the Archbold Expedition renamed it the Grand Valley.</p>
<h3>Searching for a Landing Field, Soldiers Become Explorers</h3>
<p>This time the explorers were not American and Dutch scientists, but American soldiers.</p>
<p>Our brothers came here to find aircraft landing sites that could be used against the Japanese army. When General MacArthur began to implement the island-hopping strategy in New Guinea, the only air route we could supply to him was to fly over the 1,500-mile-long Stanley Mountains at the southeastern end of the island. After the capture of Dutch New Guinea, the route was much shorter and could closely follow General MacArthur's vanguard troops.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Kenney (now General), Commander of the Allied Southwest Pacific Air Force, ordered his subordinates to open a route from the Muroc Air Force Base to Dutch New Guinea, and at least find an intermediate direct route and landing sites at both ends, so that they could be put into practical use immediately after the base was built. Sergeant Griml was sent there to reconnoiter and found two possible routes. He paid close attention to the Grand Valley, believing that it had great potential as a landing site. The first route discovered was about 200 miles southwest of the Grand Valley, passing through Ifitamin. So we set off to inspect.</p>
<h3>Savages Form a Nation in Cliffs and Walls</h3>
<p>The Grand Valley is a mile high above sea level, lying in the Baliem Valley in the mountains discovered by Archbold. In the middle of these cliffs and walls, there live strange tribes that do not communicate with the outside world: many of them die of old age without interacting with each other. The southern entrance of the Grand Valley is locked by 200 miles of wetlands and simple gorges. The east and west sides are towering peaks up to 14,000 feet high, which are like its national walls; the only possible entrance is on the north side. The crew of the twin-engine Star aircraft took off from Muroc at dawn, and we flew into the cloud layer at an altitude of 500 feet. The top of the clouds was still as high as 8,000 feet in the sky.</p>
<h3>Heads Are Cut Off or Used as Crocodile Snacks</h3>
<p>In the middle section between Muroc and the foot of the Orange Mountains, we flew over 200 miles of wetlands. This wetland is as flat as a billiard table when viewed from below. The tribes living here are a nation dedicated to taking heads. These savages are as terrifying as the eels that flood the area. From here, we can easily see why the Dutch Tanamu La exile colony is the most effectively managed in the world. The only way for prisoners to escape is to go down the river. If he escapes into the wetlands, he can choose to have his head cut off or be used as a snack for crocodiles.</p>
<p>As we approached the Orange Mountains, the cloud layer became even higher! But we caught a glimpse of a particularly steep cliff. A rare cumulus cloud rose over the Grand Valley, and we could see an occasional gap. We knew that many peaks were lurking inside, with the higher peaks protruding above the cloud layer.</p>
<h3>The Author of This Article and His Captured Monkey</h3>
<p>The person holding the monkey in the picture is Colonel Elsmore, the author of this article. This monkey has been brought back to the United States by Elsmore and given to his daughter. He has flown over the Grand Valley many times. In May of last year, after a U.S. military transport plane crashed in the Grand Valley, he enthusiastically engaged in rescue work and made great contributions.</p>
<h3>Flying Over the Orange Mountains, High into the Clouds, Over the Grand Valley</h3>
<p>We needed to fly over the Orange Mountains and find a way out on the north side of the valley. Our plane climbed to 17,000 feet before we could safely fly through or around the cloud peaks. We saw Mount Wilhelm, which is over 15,000 feet high. It's strange, the snow-capped mountains on this side!</p>
<p>We circled for thirty minutes before starting to descend. The mountains here are lined up and the peaks range in height from 13,000 feet to 6,000 feet, clearly extending along the north coast of New Guinea. In the middle of each mountain range, there is a river channel flowing through the wetlands. Suddenly, Sergeant Griml pointed to a cloud pile 300 feet high on top of a ridge and shouted into the microphone: "Quickly slide over that ridge!" So we slid over the ridge and entered a canyon, and then we repeated flying under the cloud layer and took a breath. The lower our plane flew, the narrower the canyon became. The surrounding walls also became steeper. At this time, we circled around, and a straight cliff stood opposite us, and my breathing suddenly tightened. But Griml spoke again: "There is a gap between the cliff and the cloud pile. Let's continue to fly in the middle. The valley is below this!"</p>
<h3>Natural Great Cave - The Slok River Flows</h3>
<p>As we flew over the cliffs, we observed a natural great cave, which could also be called a natural tunnel. Its rounded arch was at least three hundred feet high. The Slok River, below our plane, suddenly plunged into the steep walls of the deep gorge.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ridge, we saw native villages scattered in the valleys, stretching almost to the cloud-piercing cliffs. In this valley, about a mile away, the flowing water of the Slok River emerged from another mountain, continuing its winding course. In the clouds, a line of gap suddenly opened, and this picturesque great valley was revealed before our eyes at this moment.</p>
<h3>The Entire Great Valley Is a Fertile Land</h3>
<p>Lying among these mountains is that peculiar cluster of villages. We got an overall bird's-eye view: the Great Valley stretches thirty miles in length, with a large river called the Baling River flowing through it. The Baling River originates from a stream gorge in the north, turning into rapids and waterfalls as it flows into the valley, where its momentum slows down. After leaving the valley, it enters another stream gorge surrounded by steep cliffs, hanging upside down and becoming turbulent rapids all the way to the sea. The entire valley floor, even the surrounding cliffs, are fertile, quite different from other parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The farmland is intertwined with ditches, and crops grow everywhere. Men, women, and children are all diligently cultivating the land, which is different from other tropical regions. The sudden appearance of our plane naturally frightened these people. As the plane descended rapidly, they scattered and ran in all directions, some hiding in the sweet potato fields, others jumping into the ditches.</p>
<p>One thing that was particularly surprising was that the ditches and villages in the Great Valley were arranged in neat squares, no less impressive than American farmland. They cultivated their fields up to the cloud-piercing cliffs, which American farmers would never dare to climb so high! The natives' houses were all built at the foot of the mountains, some choosing to hide discreetly among the trees.</p>
<h3>Natives Threw Spears in an Attempt to Attack Reconnaissance Plane</h3>
<p>Each village was built with wooden and stone fences, and observation towers stood everywhere. We flew very low to take a closer look. These towers were pieced together with wood, and there was a sentry on the top of the tower, standing guard. Our plane obviously disrupted their observation system. The "sentry" desperately climbed down and slipped into the thatched hut like a shooting star. As we flew low again, a native even threw his spear upwards, trying to strike our fuselage.</p>
<p>Villages were built along both sides of the river. This river was undoubtedly a natural defensive line for the warring tribes. We couldn't see any beams or boats. But the natives certainly knew how to build bridges. Later, when flying close to the walls of this deep valley, we finally discovered a suspension bridge.</p>
<p>This reconnaissance flight gave us very little understanding of the local natives, only some indications from the photographs. We felt that the natives here were taller than the people we had encountered in other parts of New Guinea. Later, during a combat operation, the situation of the 60,000 residents in the Great Valley became clearer. This time, we only saw from the air that their houses were round, built almost like Eskimo snow houses, some long and round. They were mostly built close to trees.</p>
<h3>Having Obtained Information, We Flew to Ifitamin</h3>
<p>After obtaining many photos and observation data here, we flew to Ifitamin to find a second possible landing site. In terms of distance, climate, and navigation, Ifitamin was more suitable than the Great Valley. So, we decided to use Ifitamin. At the same time, based on the results of a survey conducted by a certain explorer from Xizhou several years ago, we believed that the natives there were very friendly. We not only wanted to avoid unfortunate bloodshed but also to hire natives for construction work. From our Dutch or Australian friends, we couldn't get any records of white people ever having been to the Great Valley. From that time on, I communicated with Archibald, comparing the information from the photos we had taken.</p>
<p>All new pilots underwent standard training on the spot to adapt to the climate and environment of New Guinea. The environment was as threatening as the Japanese devils, so the pilots constantly flew over the Great Valley to practice. War correspondents thus obtained many interesting adventure stories. I once flew George Thorp and Harley-Davidson over the Great Valley to see it, and they nicknamed the Great Valley "Shangri-La Valley."</p>
<p>As a result of repeated flights, quite a few pilots had been there, enough to form a visiting organization. Many veterans became members of the "Shangri-La" Association after returning home, and they all had certificates with flight dates.</p>
<h3>American Plane Crashed, Women's Army Corps Suffered Tragedy</h3>
<p>During a training flight, a tragedy occurred over the Great Valley. This happened in May. A military transport plane crashed into the wall of the Great Valley, and the entire fuselage was burned. Out of twenty-four people, only five survived. Among them, three were members of the Women's Army Corps serving at the Hollandia base. Within twenty-four hours, two more of them died. The one surviving woman and two men subsequently told the world many strange and bizarre stories from the Great Valley.</p>
<p>The author himself was in charge of the rescue operation this time. Unexpectedly, many mysterious local situations were answered.</p>
<h3>Three Soldiers Escaped Danger, Good News Spread Throughout America</h3>
<p>Seven weeks after the crash, the three surviving soldiers were finally rescued. We parachuted medical personnel and engineers into the Great Valley to provide relief and build a runway so that low-flying transport planes could land safely. When the weather was good, we dropped all kinds of food supplies. A communication team with two-way radios also went down. We even broadcast the news for our compatriots left in this paradise to hear.</p>
<p>What a happy event! When the three surviving comrades, male and female, were rescued back to the Hollandia base. The surviving female comrade, named Margaret Hastings, was a corporal in the Women's Army Corps. The story she told was published in newspapers and magazines throughout America.</p>
<h3>Pigs Are Fat and Large, Only Cooked During Celebrations</h3>
<p>Pigs were very valuable. Killing or eating a pig was often only done during celebrations. So, some pigs grew very fat and large before being slaughtered during festivals! The round roofs were covered with soot. The terrain of the Great Valley was very high, and fires were often needed, but there were no chimneys on the houses. Smoke came out of the gaps in the walls or the thick thatch of the roof. Men had nothing else except a piece of cloth covering their lower body. Women only had a handful of fig leaves woven into a diaper-like thing, tied to the front and back of their fat thighs, with everything else exposed. Their chests were bare.</p>
<p>Each village had a neat layout. Banana trees were everywhere, and the fields were full of sweet potatoes. Men mostly lived in stone-built round houses, while women lived in rectangular houses.</p>

<h3>Discussion of the Method of Paying Property Rental Income Tax</h3>
<p>— Tao Gongwen</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau was established and will levy property rental income tax in the city. This tax system is still in its initial stages and is being trialed, and it is inevitable that the tax law may have shortcomings. I hereby offer my opinions on the method of paying this tax.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>Paying Income Tax</p>
<p>In principle, the self-assessment method should be adopted. However, for the sake of economy and convenience, it may be advisable to adopt the withholding method. However, those who withhold taxes have no obligation to withhold taxes, so the state should provide appropriate incentives to those who withhold income tax. For example, when the deposit interest income tax was first implemented, the government provided financial institutions with a commission for withholding interest income tax, and this was the reason for it. Adopting the withholding method requires two conditions: first, the number of taxpayers (income recipients) must be far greater than the number of withholding agents (income payers), even by tens of millions of times. If the withholding method is adopted, the collection and tax payment costs can be greatly reduced. Second, the withholding agent must be able to calculate the amount of tax to be withheld independently based on the tax law. For example, deposit</p>
<p>Interest Income Tax</p>
<p>is a fixed-rate tax on the total amount, and financial institutions can calculate the amount of income tax to be withheld based on the tax rate stipulated in Article 6 of the Income Tax Law and the amount of interest receivable by each depositor, without waiting for notification from the collection agency before withholding.</p>
<p>Let us examine whether the current property rental income tax, excluding agricultural land, has the above conditions for adopting the withholding method. The answer is no. First, the number of taxpayers for property rental income tax (landlords) is far less than the number of withholding agents (tenants), which is the opposite of the situation where the number of taxpayers for deposit income tax (deposit customers) is far greater than the number of withholding agents (financial institutions). Assuming that there are 10,000 landlords (including legal entities) and 100,000 tenants in the city, if the withholding method is adopted, the collection agency must review 100,000 income reports and distribute 100,000 tax payment notices. At the same time, 100,000 people must report their income on behalf of the collection agency, and 100,000 people must pay taxes to the national treasury or its agents. Sometimes, the withholding agent has to spend more than 200 yuan on transportation expenses to pay a tax of 200 yuan, and the time spent is worth several times more than 200 yuan. In this situation, the property rental income tax borne by the people seems to be small on the surface, but in fact, the tax payment costs exceed the tax amount by several times. If the self-assessment method is adopted, the number of taxpayers in the previous example is only one-tenth of the number of withholding agents, so the manpower and resources spent on property rental income tax by the people, the collection agency, and the collection agency can be reduced by nine-tenths, accounting for only one-tenth of that under the withholding method. Comparing the two, is self-assessment more economical and convenient, or is withholding more economical and convenient? Anyone with a little common sense will not find it difficult to judge.</p>
<p>Second, Property</p>
<p>Rental Income Tax</p>
<p>Due to the progressive tax rates and the fact that the income from renting two or more properties owned by one person should be calculated together, the withholding agent cannot independently determine the amount of tax to be withheld and must wait for notification from the collection agency to confirm. This is completely different from deposit interest income tax. Although the monthly rent payable by a particular tenant is the same, the amount of income tax to be withheld often varies greatly due to changes in the total amount of rent receivable by the landlord. Here is an example to illustrate: Suppose a landlord has five houses in January, rented to four people: A, B, C, and D, at a rent of 6,000 yuan per house per month. According to Articles 3 and 6 of the Property Rental and Sale Income Tax Law and Rule 12 of the Implementing Rules, the property rental income tax payable is 1,620 yuan, and each tenant withholds 405 yuan of income tax. Suppose in early February, the landlord bought two more houses for rent, receiving 6,000 yuan of rent per house per month. According to the law, the landlord should pay 2,770 yuan of rental income per month, and the rent payable by A, B, C, and D has not changed, but the amount of income tax to be withheld in February increased from 405 yuan to 461 yuan, six dimes, six cents, six mills, six filaments. In this situation where the tax amount cannot be determined independently by the tenant, the tenant must receive notification from the collection agency before withholding income tax and paying rent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the withholding method is adopted for property rental income tax excluding agricultural land, and the withholding agent reports the income (rent) of the taxpayer, the competent collection agency must spend considerable effort to combine and calculate the income belonging to the same taxpayer without any omissions. In the absence of a unified naming system and incomplete statistics of people's property today, it is indeed difficult to comprehensively calculate the income of taxpayers based on reports from withholding agents scattered in various places. Suppose someone lives in Shanghai and has houses for rent in Shanghai, as well as in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao. If the self-assessment method is adopted, the landlord can report and pay the tax in person, without the troublesome procedures of comprehensive calculation, and the consolidated property rental income of the taxpayer can be obtained. If the withholding method is adopted and the income is reported by each tenant, assuming that each tenant is a highly educated intellectual who accurately reports the true landlord's name and address without any errors, then the Chongqing Direct Tax Bureau, the Hankou Direct Tax Bureau, the Guangzhou Direct Tax Bureau, and the Qingdao Direct Tax Bureau must receive the income reported by the tenants of the houses rented by the landlord and then forward it to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau to comprehensively calculate the landlord's property rental income in accordance with the law. The cumbersome nature of the procedure can be seen. The method of collecting taxes should be simple, convenient, and economical, which is an important principle in public finance. The fact that most of the current property rental income tax is collected through the withholding method seems to run counter to this important principle.</p>
<p>From this point of view, if we do not want the property rental income tax to become a truly good tax, then the payment method should completely adopt the self-assessment method, and we must not follow the example of the deposit interest income tax and adopt the withholding method, because the objective conditions are completely different.</p>
<h3>Women's Army Corps Corporal Hastings Who Survived the Crash</h3>
<p>There were eight members of the Women's Army Corps on the American military transport plane that crashed and burned in the Great Valley. Five of them died on the spot; two more died within 24 hours. Hastings was the luckiest of the eight. In the picture, Ms. Hastings looks worried and looks up at the sky, hoping that planes from her homeland would come and rescue her soon. Behind her are the Filipino members of the rescue team who temporarily built it.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reading Minister Yu's Talk on Financial Plans</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun recently came to Shanghai for inspection and gave a speech to our reporter, saying that the government has carefully studied the issue of new exchange rates and will formulate appropriate measures under the principle of revitalizing and developing international trade, which will be announced soon; this year's financial plan will focus on construction, with post-war rehabilitation as the center, but this year's financial expenditures, such as military reorganization, will also be quite large. It has now been decided to find ways to rectify tax revenues, and at the same time, it is planned to utilize foreign materials and strive for the stability of the monetary system and prices so that the budget approaches balance; regarding provincial and municipal local finance issues, it is necessary to first seek the prosperity of local finance, and the central government has decided to increase the amount of subsidies to local finance, and at the same time, it plans to re-divide the series of central and local finance to clarify their respective areas. In addition, it also elaborated on simplifying direct tax procedures and related issues such as the United Nations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The above words, although only a conversation with a news reporter, are simple and concise, and have somewhat clarified the country's financial policy. The people in the recovered areas have been separated from the central government's administration for a long time, and at the beginning of the restoration of the rivers and mountains, the steps taken by all parties may not be well-organized. Regarding various issues related to their own interests, such as the value of currency, the re-establishment of exchange rates, the burden of taxation, and the use of received materials, they have long hoped that the central government's responsible heads will make an announcement. Reading Minister Yu's speech to the reporters has somewhat made them understand the central government's financial administration plan, which is of some benefit to the people's understanding of the government's administration.</p>
<p>Financial and monetary problems are the crux of all problems. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the most serious problems, in addition to political problems, have actually been financial and economic problems. Although the recent strikes in the recovered areas have complex causes, they are mainly financial and economic problems. The serious threats felt by the people in the recovered areas today are mostly that there are no concrete measures in the financial and economic aspects, or that although there are measures planned, there is no courage to implement them immediately. The increase in the cost of living and the soaring prices are mainly due to the failure to stabilize the currency value. Because the currency value has not been stabilized, it has affected the turbulence of general life. The repeated occurrence of strikes is mainly because the currency income of workers' wages is not enough to cover their living expenses. — In essence, this is still a problem of the failure to stabilize the currency value. If the value of currency — currency — cannot be stabilized, then all social and economic problems can be related to financial problems. If we do not first seek the rehabilitation and restoration of the currency itself, then all rehabilitation and restoration may not be possible. This situation is common in all countries after the war. Not only is this the case in today's China. France, Germany, Australia, and Italy after World War I were all like this; even in the countries after World War II, the situation is the same. China has resisted the longest and suffered the heaviest financial trauma. At the time of post-war rehabilitation, the first thing that needs to be rehabilitated and restored is finance, and the first thing that should be rehabilitated in finance is the currency issued by the state, and how to stabilize the value of the currency. It is necessary to stabilize the value of the currency so that social unrest can be reduced and move towards a normal path. The hope of seeking society is also the most necessary thing for today's financial policy to be implemented resolutely by people with vision and魄力. Minister Yu is most familiar with the situation in Shanghai, an international financial city. After this careful inspection, I dare to believe that there will be brilliant methods. But the method must not only have "law," but also must be "handled," so that the method is valuable.</p>
<p>Secondly, another threat felt by the people in the recovered areas is the complexity of the tax system and the increase in the tax burden. And the biggest chaos is the failure to clarify the central and local financial systems. Local authorities believe that the central government monopolizes all tax sources, causing local finances to be on the verge of bankruptcy, so they have to seek their own ways to remedy it, so apportionments and harsh taxes are repeatedly issued, and the people and the government are suffering. As for taxes within the central system, the tax rates have been increased recently, so that the people in the recovered areas, after eight years of war, cannot bear the burden, and complaints are heard from time to time. The people in the recovered areas have been hoping for governance for eight years. Now that the rivers and mountains are restored and the people are renewed, they hope that there will be reasonable standards for the financial apportionment and tax burden to avoid disturbing the people.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the country, the main financial problems placed in front are the few points that the people in the recovered areas hope to achieve. However, in addition to this, some belong to organizational problems of finance, and some belong to policy problems. In terms of organizational problems, there are places in the organization of the Ministry of Finance that need to be effectively adjusted. For example, the establishment of the Direct Tax Department seems to be a superfluous matter. Since direct tax is one of the national tax revenues, it should be merged with the Taxation Department into one to save work. Furthermore, since the current financial problem is a currency problem, and the management of financial affairs is becoming increasingly complex, which is one of the main businesses of the Ministry of Finance, but at present, there is only a Currency Division under the Ministry, and there is no independent unit, such as the National Treasury Department, the Taxation Department, and the Customs Department, to be responsible for handling it, which seems insufficient to be competent. It is already urgently necessary for the Ministry of Finance to set up a special agency to manage currency and finance in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the policy issues of finance, there are the re-division of central and local finance, the conversion of land tax and the issue of the existence of the Grain Department, and issues such as salt administration and tariffs. It is said that the reason why local finances are not possible is that most of the tax sources are occupied by the central government. In Shanghai alone, it is said that the main tax revenue is still the entertainment feast tax, which is almost the only tax that supports the municipality. Even docks and warehouses are not allowed to be interfered with by the municipal government, let alone others? If this statement is not false, there is a very big problem here. The entertainment feast tax is taken from the general public, so why is it that the large factories and large firms in Shanghai benefit more from the municipality, but their burden on the municipality is so light? When re-determining the financial system of the central government and the local governments, it is imperative not to ignore the principle of "tax-paying ability" on taxes, and to ensure that the burden of taxes can be equally borne by the general taxpayers according to their tax-paying ability.</p>
<p>Regarding salt administration, it is a matter of course that the system of lead bank package traders must be abolished. However, it is said that the methods are not uniform. Old merchants in Changlu and Lianghuai still have special privileges similar to the disguised lead bank system, while Liangzhe has separately recruited new merchants to contract, and I do not know why. In terms of contribution to the country, the old merchants in various places are somewhat similar to each other, but in reality, the treatment they receive is very different. The state changes the salt law, and there was a power weighing in the original, but the change must be thorough, and a system should be clearly stipulated, or the tax should be levied on the spot, regardless of what is known, or the tax levy system should not be adopted, and the people should be allowed to buy and sell freely. As it is now, on the surface, the lead bank is abolished, but in reality, there is still a similar lead bank system in existence, which not only violates the national law, but also destroys the entire salt administration scale and affects the national economy and the people's livelihood, which is of no light importance.</p>
<p>All of the above are our feelings after reading Minister Yu's speech. We are willing to give them to the financial authorities, and it is nothing more than the meaning of the wild man offering the sun.</p>

<h3>Proclamation of Issuance of "Sun Notes" Causes Uproar in the Market; Minister Yu Denies the Allegation, Saying Speculation Fuels New Exchange Rate Announcement; Application Required to Use Frozen U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) Yesterday, rumors abounded in the city that the government would issue "Sun Notes." This was further fueled by news reports detailing the types, designs, patterns, exchange rates with foreign currencies, and issuance dates of the "Sun Notes," causing significant unease in the market.</p>
<p>[Photograph of Finance Minister Yu Hongjun (left) and Liu Gongyun (right), Director of the Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau, taken after paying their respects to Mayor Qian at the Municipal Government]</p>
<p>Neither Rumor Has Any Basis</p>
<p>A reporter specifically visited Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, who solemnly denied the matter to the reporter, stating, "I have no knowledge of this matter." The reporter further inquired about the rumored announcement of the exchange rate within the week in Nanjing or Shanghai. Yu stated that this was purely speculation and that he had no knowledge of it. Regarding the rumor that frozen U.S. dollars could now be utilized, Yu stated that since the U.S. government issued Public Notice No. 94 on December 7th of last year, most of the original freeze management laws for countries worldwide have been lifted, including for our country. If one wishes to utilize such unfrozen U.S. dollars, one must go through the procedures for applying to use them. However, since December 8th of last year, all financial and commercial transactions with the United States are not subject to these restrictions.</p>
<p>Separate Meetings with Chinese and Foreign Guests</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Yu separately summoned Mr. Litt, Manager of Citibank; Mr. Annard, Chief Representative; Mr. Peterson, Manager of Chase Bank; Mr. Gray, Manager of HSBC; Mr. Doubo, Manager of McCallie Bank; Mr. Sangor, Manager of Advantage Bank, and others. He emphasized that the business policies of foreign banks in our country must comply with the laws promulgated by our country, and that their rights and obligations are equal to those of Chinese banks. Yu had convened a meeting with leaders of the city's financial community at his residence the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, he met with three foreign guests: Mr. Freeman, General Manager of American Weili Han Company; Mr. Shi Weifu, Director of Yizhong Tobacco Company; and Mr. Xie Pu'er, General Manager of China Business Company, and others. In addition, Huang, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department; Shu Yunchang of China Textile Construction Company; Chen Changtong, Manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China, and others were also summoned by Yu and given instructions. In addition to summoning the authorities of various foreign banks yesterday afternoon, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters; Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Lieutenant Colonel Davis of the U.S. Army Supply Office in China; Smith, U.S. Commercial Counselor, and others also paid their respects.</p>
<p>Returning to Nanjing Today, Heading to Chongqing in a Week</p>
<p>This morning, if the weather permits, he will fly to the capital. It is reported that this trip will not only involve personally inspecting the repatriation of various agencies affiliated with the Ministry of Finance but also reviewing current financial issues with Lu Peizhang, Vice Minister of Finance, and others. Yu will stay in Nanjing for a week before returning to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Provisional Criminal Tribunal of the High Court Continues Trial of Traitors</h3>
<p>Five traitors were tried separately by Presiding Judge Liu and Judge Cao of the High Court yesterday morning: (1) Yang Chunting, who cohabited with his mistress at No. 5, Renrui Lane, Fanhuangdu, rented his third-floor house to Ge Wanjun in July of the previous year. Ge then secretly established a radio station in the bedroom to communicate with the mainland. The defendant, suspecting that Ge had an affair with Zuo Yangshi, reported the establishment of the secret radio station to the Japanese, leading to its exposure. (2) Gao Quansheng served as a secret agent for the Japanese Gendarmerie in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, and secretly reported the patriotic activists Ding Weiliang and Huang Haigen, leading to their arrest. (3) Jiang Yougen, Shen Anfa, and Zuo She recruited laborers to go to the Philippines to build ships for the Japanese Navy. (4) Zhang Qipin opened the Fuxing Nail Factory, manufacturing wire nails for the Japanese Jiangnan Shipyard. (5) Yang Xiguang served as an investigator in the puppet Special Higher Police Section, arresting several of our aviation personnel, including Han Zhen. Witnesses were summoned for all of the above cases, and the trials were adjourned for reconsideration.</p>
<h3>Government to Return Land Forcibly Confiscated by the Enemy and Puppets</h3>
<p>During the war, areas such as Zhabei, Nanshi, Longhua, Hongqiao, and Jiangwan in this city suffered severely from the trampling of the enemy and puppets. Later, as the Japanese were pressed by the war, they forcibly confiscated land to arrange defensive works. Once an area was designated for requisition, even if there were buildings within the boundary, they would need to be demolished immediately, without any compensation. Our reporter recently visited the Land Bureau on this matter, which concerns the rights and interests of the people, and it was stated that with respect to land requisitioned by the enemy and puppets, if no compensation was given and there is no actual need by our government, it will be investigated and returned one by one, to demonstrate the government's utmost intention to protect the rights and interests of the people.</p>
<h3>Qian Changzhao Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Electrical Workers to Resume Work by a Deadline; the Department Store Strike is Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>The labor unrest at the Electrical Company, after being mediated and persuaded by the representatives of the five major public utilities, yielded no results. At 3 p.m. yesterday, Faris was summoned to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Zhang Zhenyuan, Director of the Labor Section, and expressed his personal opinions on the eleven demands made by the labor side. In order to resolve the unrest immediately after taking office, the new Director, Wu Kaixian, ordered the representatives of the company's employees to resume work by a deadline and scheduled a mediation session for 2 p.m. today to be conducted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The order will be delivered to the Electrical Company this morning. The original text states: "Order to Ouyang Zurun and other representatives of the employees of the Shanghai Electric Company: This Bureau has investigated that the employees' strike that began at the headquarters on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month spread to the Yangshupu Power Plant on Feilun Road, and the entire plant is now in a state of labor unrest. Although this Bureau investigated the facts and scheduled a mediation committee meeting in accordance with the law, the employees used the excuse of being bound by the decision of the general meeting to refuse to attend. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang, and representatives from the General Labor Union Bureau, Zhu Chenghao, and others rushed to persuade them, but they persisted in their defiance and refused to attend. This is a blatant disregard for the law. It must be understood that public utilities are not allowed to strike under the law. As for the employees' concerns that elected worker representatives may be fired by the employer, unless they violate the law or company regulations, they will be dealt with according to the law. The Party and government representatives have guaranteed that the representatives can attend the meeting with peace of mind and await mediation. As Director of this Bureau, I care for the workers and follow the laws and regulations. I hereby order the workers to resume work by a deadline and have scheduled a meeting with representatives from both sides at 2 p.m. on the 29th of this month to conduct mediation in accordance with the law. You must comply with this order. End of Order. Director Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Tong Xingbai."</p>
<p>Nine Major Companies Officially Resume Work</p>
<p>The deadlock of the five-day strike at nine major department stores, including Sincere Company, was resolved satisfactorily at 7 p.m. last night. Representatives from both labor and management gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:30 p.m. Director Zhang Zhenyuan's mediation was unsuccessful. The newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, personally and earnestly advised both sides to make concessions to each other. Subsequently, the labor representatives telegraphed each company to resume work immediately. Detailed regulations were agreed upon at 7 p.m., and wages were increased to 32,500 yuan. The labor side expressed satisfaction, and formal work resumption will begin today.</p>
<p>Year-End Bonus at the Waterworks Resolved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks' request for a year-end bonus from all workers was addressed yesterday when Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian sent a hand-written note to the company's workers, instructing them not to take any action before a solution was reached. At the same time, he instructed both labor and management to begin negotiations. It was reported that an agreement had been reached by last night. The solution provides that those who have worked for more than one year will receive a bonus of one month's salary, and those who have worked for less than one year will receive a bonus calculated on a percentage basis.</p>
<p>The China Press Struck Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Workers in the machine room of the English-language China Press went on strike at noon on the 28th. It is said that 80% of the workers walked out. The newspaper had issued half a month's salary for January last Saturday, which was 30% more than before, in addition to one-third of a month's salary as a Lunar New Year bonus. The workers were dissatisfied with this, demanding a 100% increase in salary and an advance of one month's salary. When their demands were not met, they began to strike. The newspaper's management believed that the treatment given to the employees since the newspaper's resumption was higher than that of general printing houses.</p>
<h3>French Tramway Trolleybuses Resume Full Service</h3>

The Central Government's selection was most appropriate. Former Director Wu and Acting Director Ge had been diligent in their roles for four months, and future social happiness should see further progress.</p>
<p>Wu and Tong Deliver Inaugural Addresses</p>
<p>Director Wu Kaixian then delivered a speech, stating, "I have been in Shanghai for thirty years and have been engaged in revolutionary work for twenty years. The affairs of the Social Affairs Bureau are very complex. Fortunately, former Director Wu and Acting Director Ge have already established a considerable foundation. In the future, I will follow their example, and everything will be based on laws and regulations." Deputy Director Tong Xingbai then delivered a speech, stating, "As Deputy Director, I will do my best to assist the Director in promoting our work."

<h3>U.S.-Ordered Vessel, "Zhongtong," Arrives at Wusong</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Communications previously ordered two ocean vessels from the United States, named "Zhongshan" and "Zhongtong." Both have a tonnage of 10,480 tons and are known as sister ships. The "Zhongshan" arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year and is currently sailing between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, specializing in the transportation of coal. The "Zhongtong" is reported to have also arrived from New York, carrying a large number of relief supplies. Due to the lack of a reliable wharf, it is now waiting outside the Wusongkou to be imported. Both vessels fly the national flag and are still represented by the American President Lines.</p>

<h3>Representatives and Committee Members of the Japanese Residents' Self-Government Association Elected</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The election of representatives and committee members of the Japanese Residents' Self-Government Association began on the 26th. Seventy candidates entered the competition, and the results were announced yesterday afternoon. Twenty-five people, including Kanzo Utsumi, were elected. However, the results are still subject to final review before they can be finalized. This election is an experiment in civil governance for the Japanese residents granted by our authorities. The 80,000 Japanese residents have high expectations for the new committee members, whose tasks are approximately as follows: democratization of the self-government association, acceleration of repatriation efforts, solving livelihood problems after returning home, promoting women's rights, rebuilding Japan, and strengthening the solidarity of the 80,000 Japanese residents. In addition, the relief of refugees from the Jiangdao Maru disaster is their most pressing responsibility. It is reported that the voluntary donations from the Japanese residents have reached 621,420 yuan as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Potassium Alkali Method Invention Granted Patent</h3>
<p>Industrial chemical experts Zheng Zhongzhi and his younger brother Zheng Xianxi have invented two potassium alkali methods after five years of research and have been granted patents for each. Zheng has drafted a plan for mass production. Zheng was recently summoned by the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau and will be taking on an important position in Taiwan soon.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Distributes Relief Supplies; China Receives the Lowest Share; Director Zheng Baonan Reports on Work Overview</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Translation Department of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in this city hosted reporters at the Duchen Hotel and invited Zheng Baonan, Director of the UNRRA Washington Office, who had recently arrived in Shanghai, to report.</p>
<p>Relief Supplies Shipped to Qingdao</p>
<p>Director Shen first reported that a U.S. military landing ship would be dispatched to Qingdao with a large shipment of relief supplies. Approximately 1,000 tons of flour, clothing, medicine, milk powder, and other supplies will be distributed to fellow countrymen within the Communist-controlled areas in Shandong Province. The use of landing ships for transportation was the result of a request by UNRRA Director Keyser to the U.S. Army and Navy. Marshal Marshall and General Wedemeyer expressed their sympathy.</p>
<p>China Receives the Lowest Share</p>
<p>Shen then introduced Zheng Shinan to report, stating that UNRRA's assistance to our country was US$56,250,000, which is US$1.25 per compatriot. In terms of per capita allocation, our country receives the lowest share. He hopes that UNRRA can make adjustments. Zheng then listed the amounts received by various countries, noting that even countries formerly at war with the Allies, such as Austria, received more than our country. The reasons for the inadequate allocation: First, perhaps because there are more UNRRA personnel of European origin, there is an inevitable bias toward European countries; second, UNRRA doubts our country's ability to absorb these supplies. In fact, if UNRRA could provide more assistance to our country in terms of water and land transportation equipment, absorption and transportation would not be a problem. Zheng also stated that he will visit areas with the most severe disaster situations, such as Henan and Hunan, next week.</p>
<p>Three Principles for Requesting Relief</p>
<p>Director Shen and Zheng then answered questions raised by various reporters, summarized as follows: (1) On September 19th of last year, our country requested US$945 million at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference in London, but because it was decided at that time to provide relief to former enemy countries such as Germany and Austria, it was indicated that the amount could be reduced to US$800 million, but the result was not as desired. (2) Countries requesting relief should follow three principles: the extent of the loss, the size of the population, and the situation of the ceasefire. The ceasefire in Europe was gradual, and British and American troops provided great assistance to the countries where they were stationed as they advanced. Taking Italy as an example, it received more than US$500 million in relief. Because victory came suddenly to our country, we never received this kind of benefit. (3) All countries intend to extend the UNRRA closure date. Our country, however, ended the war three months later than Europe, so it will end at the end of March next year. This matter can be decided at a future United Nations Relief Conference. China hopes to extend it for another six months. (4) Many people in our country are opposed to China leasing British ships to transport relief supplies. In fact, these ships fly the United Nations flag, and British merchants are simply providing a service. (5) To date, UNRRA supplies have arrived in China on 31 ships, totaling approximately 135,000 tons, of which 29 ships arrived in Shanghai, one ship went to Qingdao, and one ship went to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Bandits Apprehended in Nightclubs</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Judicial Section of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau in western Shanghai received a confidential report the other day stating that a large number of bandits were hiding in various dance halls on Tibet Road and in the Nanshi area.

They successively apprehended thirteen bandits, including Chai Baisheng, Liu Deyun, Wang Henggen, Guo Changgen, Chen Changfa, Chen Guoxiang, Chen Boqing, Chen Youguan, Zhao Liangui, Qu Zhenghui, Zhao Yunjiang, Yao Qi, and Ding Minghong. They also seized a Mauser pistol. After strict interrogation at the bureau, the suspects confessed to using firearms to rob the homes of the Quan Wu family on Xinzha Road, the He Yutang family on Fuxing Road, the Huang Ruting family on Yangshupu Road, the Yufeng Rice Store on Shunchang Road, and the Ju Haofen family on Songxue Street in Nanshi. After the investigation is completed, the suspects will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Director Jia of the Bureau of Public Works, Wang Shengsan, Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Shengsan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, took office yesterday. Wang is a senior figure in China's engineering community and enjoys a high reputation. In 1930 and 1936, he attended the World Power Conference and the Railway Conference twice, serving as the chief representative of China. After graduating from Jiaotong University, he went to the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom to continue studying mechanical engineering.

<h3>Pu Zhengdong Reports on Shanghai's Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure; 2 Billion Needed to Break Even Over Four Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held a National Father Commemoration Week yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Mayor Qian led the ceremony, and Finance Director Pu Zhengdong reported on the fiscal situation in the city since its recovery. Mayor Qian then introduced the newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, to meet with the colleagues of the Municipal Government. The main points of Director Pu's report are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai's Revenue and Expenditure Have Never Been Balanced</p>
<p>It was stated that Shanghai's fiscal revenue and expenditure have never been balanced. Previously, when revenue was insufficient, public bonds were issued and public assets were disposed of to achieve balance. Since the Central Government revised the fiscal revenue and expenditure system in 1943, the business tax, land tax, property rental and sale income tax, deed tax, stamp tax, and inheritance tax, which originally belonged to the local government, have been completely transferred to the Central Government. Currently, the taxes belonging to the local government are only the entertainment tax, banquet tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, and house tax, totaling five types. These are the only sources of revenue for all administrative and construction needs of the city.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Figures for the Past Four Months</p>
<p>The lawful revenue from municipal taxes totaled more than 16.44 million yuan in one week in September last year, 113.62 million yuan in October, 278.79 million yuan in November, 742.1 million yuan in December, and 713.9 million yuan to the 24th of this month, for a total of 1,864.85 million yuan. The revenue has been increasing month by month, which is only due to the continuous improvement of collection methods and does not increase the burden on the people. As for the expenditure, it totaled 56.87 million yuan in September last year, 1,007.965 million yuan in October, 1,278.42 million yuan in November, and 1,492.12 million yuan in December, for a total of 3,907.07 million yuan. The net difference between the revenue and expenditure is approximately 2,004.222 million yuan. In addition to allocating start-up funds, emergency funds, and police winter uniform expenses, the administrative expenses, living subsidies, and rice subsidies that originally belonged to the national budget from September to December of last year have not yet been allocated.</p>
<h3>Scavenging Bomb Fragments; Arms and Legs Blown Off</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At approximately 3:20 p.m. yesterday, two young scavengers, Xi Quanfa and Xi Linquan, residing at No. 58, Xinmin Xincun, Xujiahui, western Shanghai, picked up ten large and small artillery shells in a certain place. They first used a hammer to strike one of the shells, intending to sell it as scrap copper and iron. Unexpectedly, it exploded with a loud bang, blowing off Quanfa's left arm and injuring his right hand on the spot, and blowing off Linquan's right leg. Both fell into pools of blood, barely alive. Police officers arrived and sent them to the First Municipal Hospital in Nanshi. The remaining shells were taken away by the 264th Regiment of the Army for destruction.</p>
<h3>He Fengshan Hosts Gathering for People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hosted a reception for people from all walks of life at No. 23, Daxi Road, at 7 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Re-launched "Financial Review Monthly" Published Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Financial Review Monthly" has been published in Hong Kong for seven years. It was recently relocated from Chongqing to Shanghai for re-launch. The office is located at No. 97, former Edward Road. The first issue of Volume 14 was published yesterday. In addition to contributions from many experts, including Li Ming, Tong Mengzheng, Zou Zongyi, Zhang Baiyi, Dai Mingzhong, Zhou Xianwen, Chai Jianshi, Chu Baoyi, and Jian Guansan, it also contains three important pieces of information: "Financial, Monetary, and Economic Reconstruction Laws and Regulations," "Shanghai Gold, Foreign Exchange, Public Bond, and Stock Market Tables for the Past Six Months," and "Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Handling Regulations," which are extremely valuable for reference.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The Siberian anticyclone center is in Mongolia and North China. A small typhoon is currently moving west or northwest over the Palau Islands.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Over the Yellow Sea, haze, cloudy turning sunny, colder, northwest to northeast winds, moderate force.

<h3>Sun Yat-sen Note Stimulates Sentiment; Gold Price Gradually Rises; US Dollar Fluctuates with the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to rising gold prices reported from other locations, and further stimulated by the "Sun Yat-sen Note," major players in the industry planned to initiate a short squeeze. Buying momentum was intense for a time. However, physical US dollars were heavily sold, pushing the spread (套頭) to over 640 yuan. The gold market had a supply of short selling positions (套賣頭寸), making it difficult for the price increase to be sustained. Credit was extremely tight. At noon, long positions were liquidated, leading to a slight dip. The morning opening saw a rise to 9.1 million. Buyers came in droves, and industry players joined forces to compete for purchases. After the opening, the price rose gradually to around 9.6 million. At this point, the US dollar market did not show a corresponding increase, leading to short selling. Although there was a small pullback, there was much struggle in between. Near noon, long positions were liquidated. At noon, due to a shortage of funds, the price succumbed to below 9.4 million. In the afternoon, there were not many spot transactions. When next-day delivery opened, it had rebounded to 9.53 million. The continued weakness of the US dollar affected sentiment. In the end, it remained around 9.45 million. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the spot price rose by 38,000. Jewelry shops raised the price of gold ornaments to 100,200. Fine silver was at 850 yuan. Silver dollars rose to 530 yuan. The unofficial discount (暗拆) ranged from 1 jiao to 1.4 jiao.</p>
<p>Physical US dollars were being sold in large quantities. Doubts arose about whether cash could be used for settlement purposes, causing hesitancy. The morning opening, stimulated by the gold market, rose to 1460 yuan. Initially, it fluctuated. Later, due to the dramatic rise in the gold market, it triggered arbitrage buying (套買) (the spread against gold widened to 645 yuan per ten taels), gradually rising to around 1480 yuan. Later, as gold prices fell back, the US dollar also declined to slightly above 1460 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, a further small decline was seen. The supply of physical US dollars from money exchange businesses exceeded demand. As a result, it closed 15 yuan higher compared with last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar notes initially rose slightly for both new and old issues, stimulated by the gold market. However, old issues, due to their lower speculative nature, were somewhat inferior to new issues. But in the end, the high prices could not be sustained. Both new and old issues remained unchanged compared with last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Major Players Manipulate; Public Bonds See Another Price Increase</h3>
<p>Since the absorption of public bonds at lower prices by industry players last Saturday, there had been signs of waiting for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, news reports that "Sun Yat-sen Notes" would soon be issued were exploited to the fullest extent, driving up prices with all their might. In a half-true, half-false state, Class C bonds fell to 1650 yuan at the morning opening. Major players jointly bought, employing both short squeezes and price manipulation. The shouting of prices was done in one go, wildly raising them to over 1950 yuan. The bulls were satisfied and stopped. Then came a round of selling and shorting. Under the dual pressure, the price plummeted by more than 400 yuan in an instant, falling back to 1500 yuan. After this, fluctuations were frequent. Major players and retail investors had different views. The price first rose to above 1800, then fell back to within 1700 yuan at noon due to time constraints. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Classes A and B each rose by 310 yuan, Class C by 370 yuan, Class D by 330 yuan, and Class E by 370 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation Exploits Rumors; Chinese Stocks Make Steady Progress</h3>
<p>Before the capital of counterfeit currency had been fully processed, news reports stated that "Sun Yat-sen Notes" were about to be issued. Regardless of the source of the news, speculators were able to make full use of it. Yong Spinning opened in the morning already raised to over 1800 yuan, and Mei Ya at 12400 yuan. However, at this time, due to the urgency of the rumors, the shouting of prices was intermittent. Later, as credit tightened, some businesses had to sell off purchased gold to prepare for settlement. There was a slight decline, but there were many fluctuations in between. Both Yong Spinning and Mei Ya fell back about 100 yuan from their peak. Until the noon close, they were still fluctuating. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yong Spinning and Mei Ya each rose by 130 yuan, Xinhe and China Textile each rose by 30 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot Stocks" (三小熱) each rose by about 10%. Due to their cheap base prices, unpopular stocks also attracted attention and continued to make progress.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were passively raised due to the stimulation of stocks and bonds. Therefore, they were not as brilliant as stocks and bonds, but the process was extremely stable and there were not many pullbacks. Until the noon close, compared with last Saturday, medium and small stocks such as Yi Spinning and Paper Industry each rose by over 200 yuan. Jardine Matheson, due to its large price and high cost, failed to prosper. Rubber stocks were desolate.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Soar Again; Spinning and Construction Company Will Not Sell Within the Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market made rapid progress. The rumors of Sun Yat-sen Notes revealed in newspapers greatly boosted morale. Industry players and retail investors successively absorbed massively. In the case of a shortage of stock from each factory, the price rose rapidly. 16-count and 20-count yarn increased by 50,000, and fine yarn increased by 70,000 to 80,000. At noon, the Spinning and Construction Company announced that it would no longer be selling within the year, so the trend became even more outstanding.</p>
<h3>Too Little Allocated Raw Materials; Silk Unanimously Becomes Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the artificial silk market outside of exchange transactions, 120-numbered Tianqiao spot was priced at a maximum of 1.23 million yuan, and a minimum of 1.2 million yuan. Warehouse receipts were 800,000 to 810,000 yuan, an increase of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan compared with the weekend. This was really because the number of raw materials allocated for the first time was too small, and each factory was running out quickly. There was still actual sales, so factory operators were no longer static. The cost of goods arriving increased sharply, and each tier of quality was raised unanimously. Intermediate tiers required a price of more than 1.5 million yuan. Silk goods had unimpeded sales and prices also followed. Mei Ya quilt covers were 850,000 yuan per 100 pieces, Da Cheng ge bi crepe was 2,800 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was 12,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Firm and Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was still firm. Chinese yarn mills purchased 42-count raw material American cotton middling flower at 62,000 yuan, and 32-count raw material San Yu Zhen fine velvet flower at 63,500 yuan. The above were all factory delivery prices. Hua Hao purchased 16-count raw material Fire Machine flower at 44,000 yuan, and Zhou Pu seed flower was priced at 9,000 yuan and 9,200 yuan. The above were all warehouse delivery prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Merchants Act Reserved and Do Not Release</h3>
<p>The news of the issuance of Sun Yat-sen Notes was rampant in the market. The gold price had already risen. Those holding goods had a preconceived notion of valuing goods over currency, acting reserved and not releasing stock. In addition to the low inventory of finished products, the cloth market had a slowly rising phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Prices Soar; Edible Oil Rises Most Sharply</h3>
<p>Due to the rainy weather and the end of the year, the source of supply was gradually scarce. As stores were about to close for the holiday, they all had to prepare goods, so actual sales were very high, causing both japonica and indica rice to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Flour also increased by 300 to 400 yuan because of scarce arrivals and smoother retail sales. Soybeans were unusually lively and continued to rise by 500 to 600 yuan. The oil market also surged by a huge 6,000 to 7,000 yuan as stores prepared for the New Year. Soybean cake followed suit, rising by 100 to 200 yuan. The liquor market was firm and steady.</p>
<p>The rice market will close tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the temporary rice and grain market, the market will complete its work today due to the approaching end of the year, and will not begin trading again until the fifth day of the new lunar year next spring.</p>
<h3>As the Final Accounting Period Approaches, Tea Market Transactions Decline</h3>
<p>The final accounting period for all industries and businesses in the 34th year of the Republic of China will soon arrive. Tea merchants must also follow the precedent of doing annual operating statements, so both buyers and sellers are unwilling to transact. The only occasional transactions are from retail consumers requiring cash for adjustments. Therefore, there are very few transactions. Market momentum is quite calm. Market conditions lack significant changes, and remain stable. According to news from the Tianjin gang, there is high demand for Dafang green tea, etc. The general trend is to resume activity after the lunar new year.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Silent; Firewood and Charcoal Inevitably Soften at Year's End</h3>
<p>Coal market transactions are zero and silent. Near the end of the year, most coal merchants have temporarily closed. Without actual sales channels, most are unwilling to purchase. Sales of white coal chunks are sluggish and the market continues to fall. White coal dust, given the brisk sales of coal briquettes, is considered lucrative by industry peers and the market is surprisingly firm. Due to the rain, small firewood and charcoal vendors are unable to achieve brisk sales. The cargo owners are eager to liquidate and return home. They can only sell at a lower price, but buyers are still lacking.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Price Firm and Nimble; Doubled in November</h3>
<p>Yesterday's timber market situation, although it was the end of the year, was still outstanding, nimble and profitable. Lauan plywood and pine boards were being sought after, and prices repeatedly set new records, already doubling in November.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>

<h3>京臨大 收押 Students scheduled for trial tomorrow; Wang Shulin Declares He Did Not File a Private Lawsuit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Eight students detained at Jingling University (京臨大), the court has scheduled a trial for the 30th. The class director Wang Shulin, and the secretary of the Youth League in Nanjing Huang Tong, requested the court to advance the trial date. The detained students have been on hunger strike for four days. It is rumored that the case is expected to be resolved with a light sentence.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Students arrested and detained at Jingling University, the local court has set the trial to take place on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch] Students dismissed from the Jingling University Preparatory Class (首都臨時大學補習班) for causing trouble, the prosecutor's office of the Capital District Court (首都地方法院檢察處) considered them suspected of committing crimes. The students arrested, including Yu Baiqing (于柏靑) and eight others, have been investigated by the prosecutor and, in accordance with Articles 136 and 302 of the Criminal Procedure Law, have been prosecuted for obstructing official duties and freedom. The prosecutor's office has completed its duties. The case will now be handled by the judge of the criminal court in accordance with the law. Although prosecution has been initiated, whether a crime has been committed is subject to the court's trial. It is currently difficult to speculate. After hearing the news, the eight students detained immediately expressed a hunger strike. Therefore, a part of the "121 Student Association" (一二一同學會) did not attend classes on the 25th, and advocated to request the release of the arrested students. The court will soon open the trial for this case. The actual observations and interviews from all sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>School Side</p>
<p>When the newspaper reporter went to the Preparatory Class on the 26th, he saw that notices of the hunger strike of the eight arrested students, including Yu Baiqing, were posted on the two walls at the entrance, calling on students and people of the community for help. On the 25th, part of the so-called 121 Student Association in the class did not attend classes. Those who went outside to appeal were doing this. However, visiting the classrooms, the majority of students were in class. When the class was first established, those in charge thought that the preparatory class was very simple, opening a class when it reached 50 people. The curriculum was a preparatory nature. The general provision was for ordinary subjects to be sufficient. Unexpectedly, the number of students later increased, and all departments of the university were prepared, which was very urgent. The class director recruited many outstanding professors from Chongqing (渝), Shanghai (滬) and the mainland (內地), (such as the famous scholar Sun Hongfen (孫洪芬) of the former Science Society (科學社). He met the reporter just now, and then knew that he was the professor of the chemical engineering department of the class), which was already a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Professor Side</p>
<p>According to Wang Shulin, the director of the class: the previous student disturbances were due to the English test paper, but the biggest demand came from students of the former Zhongda University (僞中大學生), who wanted to be assigned to formally study at Zhongda (中大) after completing this preparatory class. Frankly speaking, if they allow them this condition, no matter how hard they suffer, it will not work. This matter is not only handled by the Ministry of Education (敎部), which does not have this method, but Zhongda itself, because the previous school buildings could only accommodate 2,000 people, and now the number of students has increased to 4,500. They already feel difficult, and cannot say that the Zhongda door is closed tightly, and people are not allowed to enter, but it is not that you can rush in by banging on it. If students can study hard in the class and get good grades, many of the professors here are in Zhongda, and can feel that the students are good and preside over public opinion. There may be a chance to insert themselves. I cannot deceive or perfunctorily make promises that I cannot do myself, and hope that students can enter Zhongda, but it depends on their efforts. As for the arrested students, he did not act as the plaintiff, and did not file a private lawsuit. It was entirely the prosecutor who believed that the students had obstructed official duties and freedom, and considered them suspected of committing a crime. The prosecutor acted as the plaintiff and filed a public prosecution. Wang also sent a letter to the court, expressing leniency and forgiveness towards the students. Since he did not accuse them, he could not accommodate the students' request to bail the students out in his personal name. Students can come up with their own ideas and apply for bail according to the law.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Side</p>
<p>According to relevant authorities: the Ministry of Education's reorganization of student life is an educational administrative process, and it ends with the procedure of expelling students. The students were arrested and interrogated for assaulting the class director, which is a legal issue for the court. Judicial independence and educational administration have no right to interfere. As for the request for bail, students can apply for it according to the law, subject to the court's verification.</p>
<p>Court Side</p>
<p>After learning that the detained students were on hunger strike, President Wang (汪院長) of the Capital District Court sent the chief clerk Tu Huai-li (涂懷禮) to visit the students at the detention center on the 26th at 11 a.m. to express President Wang's concern for the youth, explaining that the matter will be conducted according to legal channels, and will soon open the trial, advising the students to eat as usual (one said that the students were not on hunger strike), and said that the hunger strike request is meaningless, and the court is not responsible for this matter, and there is no reason to be coerced by this to influence the case. The conversation lasted for two hours, and the students also expressed that the warden treated the young people well. It is heard that the court will open the trial soon, and will hold a public trial in a few days. According to regulations, Director Wang sent a letter to the court, expressing leniency, and the court sympathized with the psychological observation of the young people who blindly violated the law. It can be said that the law cannot be abandoned, but the circumstances are understandable. It is speculated that the trial will be lenient. It is expected that the trial will be opened and resolved around the 20th of this month. It is also heard that an investigation court will be held first, to study the matter in advance, and then a three-way hearing (with three judges appearing in court at the same time) to ensure thoroughness and care.

<h3>Guangxi University President Li Yunhua Goes to Chongqing to Ask the Ministry of Education for Instructions on Restoration Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin News] Guangxi University President Li Yunhua went to Chongqing a few days ago. It is reported that there are two purposes for this trip: (1) The number of students at the school was originally scheduled to be 600, but recently, due to the restoration of transportation, the number of people coming from all directions has exceeded 1,000, which is very different from the original budget, and it is proposed to ask the Ministry of Education to allocate additional funds. (2) Most of the school buildings in Guilin were destroyed, and reconstruction is not easy. Although classes are now being held in Liuzhou, the school buildings are covered with bamboo sheds, which only shelter from wind and rain, so some people advocate moving to the original site in Wuzhou, which also needs to be decided by the Ministry of Education.

<h3>The Top Ten Medicines of 1945</h3>
<p>— Mu Ming</p>
<p>Just like electing the top ten movie stars, the Journal of the American Medical Association recently specially invited major physicians to select the ten most important medicines of 1945. The results were quite interesting.</p>
<p>Now, let's list the ten famous medicines of 1910 for comparison, so that we can see the degree of medical advancement over the past 35 years. The top ten medicines of 1910 were also selected by a majority of doctors, and their rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ether, (2) Morphine, (3) Digitalis, (4) Diphtheria Antitoxin, (5) Vaccinia Virus, (6) Iron, (7) Quinine, (8) Iodine, (9) Alcohol, (10) Mercury.</p>
<p>From this table, it can be seen that the medical scientists of the early 20th century were still very immature, far from being comparable to today, and that humans at that time were far less happy and safe than we are now, because the weapons used to fight against diseases were too weak, and life simply had no guarantee.</p>
<p>In 1945, the throne of the top ten medicines was seized by Penicillin, which is universally recognized and without a doubt. This great new invention of penicillin is truly worthy of being called the king of medicines. Its contribution to mankind is too great, and there is no precedent for this in the history of medicine. Sulfa drugs were also dazzling and unparalleled, but they inevitably paled in comparison after the invention of penicillin. Now, they are listed together as one item in the top ten list, because there are too many new drugs in modern times, each with its own advantages. Only listing one would inevitably lead to regret. In the ranking list below, each item is based on a type of drug:</p>
<p>(1) Penicillin and similar products, sulfonamide drugs.</p>
<p>(2) Blood, plasma, and blood products.</p>
<p>(3) Quinine and the artificial antimalarial drug Atabrine.</p>
<p>(4) Ether and other anesthetics; including morphine, codeine, and various sleeping pills.</p>
<p>(5) Digitalis cardiac stimulants.</p>
<p>(6) 606-type arsenic preparations.</p>
<p>(7) Immunological preparations, including various vaccines and serums.</p>
<p>(8) Insulin and liver extract.</p>
<p>(9) Other hormones.</p>
<p>(10) Vitamins.</p>
<p>The drugs included in this table are really too complex and broad. Among them, immunological preparations, hormones, and vitamins are the most brilliant pages in the history of modern medical science, and they are definitely not something that just one or two drugs can represent. It can be said that it took a lot of effort to arrange such a table, but in fact, there are still many drugs whose value cannot be ignored even though they did not make the list.</p>
<p>It is surprising that blood and its products actually jumped to second place. This is probably because there were too many blood transfusions during the war. In terms of application, the amount of blood transfused must have been very large. Similarly, addiction drugs are given special attention because the war was mostly conducted in tropical regions (especially the American war in the South Pacific), and the threat of malaria is far greater than in the past.</p>
<p>The rapid progress of medicine and the rapid changes in drugs are truly amazing. Just imagine that terms like vitamins and hormones were simply unheard of in 1910, but now they are household names, known to both women and children. It is expected that progress will accelerate even further in the future. If the top ten medicines are selected again in ten years, I wonder what kind of changes there will be.</p>

<h3>"Discarded Calendar" and "Laborious"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Geyi</p>
<p>Despite your government issuing an order to abolish the lunar calendar, the "discarded calendar" still exists perfectly well and will never be 100% abolished! Of course, on the surface, we have adopted the Gregorian calendar, and all agencies, schools, etc. follow the Gregorian calendar. However, the penetration of the lunar calendar into the folk has long reached an unshakable degree, and it is by no means a political order that can easily "discard" it from the minds of the people! Just look, why do people still calculate their birthdays according to the discarded calendar? Why is there a kind of liveliness during the discarded calendar New Year that the Gregorian calendar New Year does not have? All of these are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>Now, isn't it time for the discarded calendar New Year again? It's the New Year! But the New Year requires money in many ways: gift-giving, buying New Year's goods, paying for coolies and servants, giving "lucky money"... Money, money, money. Money makes the New Year a daunting and difficult hurdle! True, for the big bosses, there are official profits here and bonuses there. Today, one subordinate pays tribute with chickens and ducks, and tomorrow, another subordinate presents hams, enjoying the "New Year's blockbuster" and trying a table of "sacrifice dishes" costing tens of thousands of yuan. It's truly "Isn't it a joy!" But for the small employees and the salaried class, the income is meager and pitiful, while the expenses are huge and alarming. Everywhere, people feel "short of money," but New Year's gifts must be given, and a "grand appearance" must be "held up"! Therefore, one can only sigh while reluctantly forcing a smile and saying "Congratulations and get rich"! And when the end of the year arrives, "it is time for the poor to pay their debts," who can jump out of the palm of the creditor? Okay, let's look back at how the prices are; how are they? Can you deny that prices have consistently risen more than they have fallen? It's truly "It's hard for the poor to get through the New Year," and "Wang Xiaoer's New Year is worse than the last!"</p>
<p>It's true that to get through a "discarded calendar" New Year, you can't help but say "laborious"! ———Truly "laborious"! Indeed "laborious"! Really "laborious"!</p>
<p>To solve the problem of "laborious," there is only one way, and that is to thoroughly and fundamentally abolish the "discarded calendar"! But, to abolish the "discarded calendar"? In fact, it is a more "laborious" thing than celebrating the New Year!</p>

<h3>Chongqing Snippets</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>What has the Political Consultative Conference given us? Can the ceasefire order promote peace? The voices of the people are all hoarse. The people's hope is not to enjoy a comfortable life. Even if life is more difficult, they only ask to be able to exist in an orderly and worthwhile time. Don't walk towards the road of destruction!</p>
<p>At a certain speech meeting of the Political Consultative Conference representatives, the audience stirred up an unfavorable action. They opposed the representative's argument and even "used force"! Although it was an unorganized and disorderly raising of angry fists, they shouted in unison; "Long live Chairman Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!" This proves that justice cannot be disguised!</p>
<p>The people who stayed in the mountain city seem to be indifferent to their expectations for the upcoming Spring Festival. Most people had too perfect expectations for it when victory first came, a beautiful dream of "returning home for the New Year." Since it is impossible to realize, coupled with some unpleasant emotions entangled, who can still have the interest in "listening to the sound of firecrackers and feeling happy"?</p>
<p>In Central Park, a steel and cement monument is being built. It is to commemorate the martyrs who contributed to the War of Resistance. Okay! Let it stand in this park, the site of victory in the War of Resistance! Tell these living people: "Who did you die for!"</p>

<h3>Between Merit and Demerit</h3>
<p>— Tan Ziyou</p>
<p>These days, traitors are being tried everywhere. The newspaper on the 16th had two reports; one was the trial of Gan Weilu in Shanghai, and the other was the trial of Chen Hongci in Guangzhou. These two treasures each have their own ugly appearances, and at the same time, they further explain their past history. The reason why they say it is, in the final analysis, nothing more than hoping that the lord will be extra kind and declare them innocent.</p>
<p>People come into the world and should establish some careers for the nation, for the country, and for their own clan, so as not to waste this trip to the world. This is nothing to be proud of; this is just one's duty. Looking at the past of people like Chen Hongci and Gan Weilu, it is indeed not bad; but what about now? They are traitors. How good it would have been if they could have promoted and expanded their past. However, they fell into the water, causing eternal regret, not only defiling the great achievements of all their ancestors, but also dimming the glory of their descendants! Now, they are still unwilling to confess their guilt, and they even fantasize about using a little of their past history to "offset" today's crime.</p>
<p>Two people scold each other on the street. I scold you for having a pockmarked face, and you scold me for being bald. Although what everyone scolds is indeed the other party's shortcomings, it does not mean that just because you have hit the other party's shortcomings, you can say that your own shortcomings are not shortcomings! Saying that someone else is bald does not explain that your own face is not pockmarked! At most, you can say that you don't have this shortcoming.</p>
<p>We should not casually obliterate a person's past achievements; but we cannot regard this as capital for doing bad things, betraying the country, or committing crimes in the future, as a tool for offsetting crimes.</p>
<p>Merit and crime cannot be merged in any way, like positive and negative numbers cancelling each other out. At least, this should be the case when merit and crime do not occur at the same time.</p>
<p>Whether you betrayed the country or not is the purpose of trying traitors. If you did, you must be guilty; if you didn't, bring the evidence that you didn't betray the country! What does past merit or demerit have to do with today? Now that you have become a traitor, what is the use of a photo personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang? What is the use of being classmates with someone? What is the use of being a judge for more than ten years?</p>
<p>Past history is useful, but it only serves as a lesson for us today, as a tool to encourage us to move forward and urge us to do good. It is already "a great sin" not to promote and expand such a good past. Now that you have betrayed the country, you still want to use the past to offset your crime, and there are even such mouths in the world to say this!</p>

<h3>The Eyes of the Soul</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>There are many people whose eyes are not blind, but their "eyes of the soul" are blind. Because what is revealed from their souls is not light, but darkness. The soul is the master of a person's body and mind, and should always be kept pure and clean. If it is slightly covered with some dust, it is tantamount to obscuring the entire "eyes of the soul."</p>
<p>It is not a very sad thing for a person's eyes to be blind. Ms. Helen Keller said: "The blind are not considered the most defective, because the defects of the visual organs can be remedied in various ways." This is very true. Modern scientific civilization has already brought many blessings to the blind. The various new facilities in blind schools have solved the difficulties of reading and learning for the blind. The blind can still read newspapers, play music, receive external stimuli, and awaken the motivation of life. There are many blind people in the world who have struggled and succeeded in the dark and reached the bright side of life.</p>
<p>According to the research of modern psychologists, the learning ability of the blind often exceeds that of ordinary people. Some say that the intelligence of the blind is higher than that of ordinary sighted people, but this is not entirely true. Hollingworth said: "The memory of the blind does sometimes surpass that of ordinary people, which is a compensatory effect. Visual defects are compensated for in other ways." Generally speaking, the blind are not easily disturbed by external visual distractions because of their blindness. Their hearts are always quieter, and their thoughts are more focused, so their learning ability is naturally much higher.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that although the eyes of the blind cannot see external things, their "eyes of the soul" may be much brighter. Many blind musicians can play the sincere tunes from the depths of their hearts and move countless people, perhaps not without reason?</p>
<p>What is sad is that there are many people in society whose eyes are not only not blind, but also have no nearsightedness at all. Their eyes are sharp and their eyesight is strong, but their hearts are not bright at all. Their thoughts and behaviors are base and unbearable, corrupt and unbearable, giving people the feeling of "dregs in a sewage ditch." Although the eyes of such people are bright, their hearts are incomparably dark. Their minds are drowsy and their thoughts are as stagnant as dead wood. They spend the whole day in a muddle-headed way. For these "soulless blind people," life becomes nothing more than eating and sleeping. They themselves feel that life is meaningless. Life is originally full of hope, but they say there is no hope, only frustration and negativity. The future is originally bright, but they say there is no light, only darkness and depression. In fact, what is unfolding before us is infinite hope and light, but their "eyes of the soul" have long been blinded, and a large cataract covers them, so they naturally cannot see hope and light.</p>
<p>To hope for social progress and cultural development, we must let the "eyes of the soul" shine brightly. We must demand improvement and upward mobility in life, increase the positive significance of life for individuals and society, make our lives purposeful and conscious, remove all the shadows in our minds, not only maintain physical health, but also strive for mental health. Eliminate all bad mental states. If our "eyes of the soul" cannot see clearly, we should immediately find ways to treat them.</p>
<p>Open our eyes to see this dynamic world outside, to see farther and clearer. Open our "eyes of the soul" to think, observe, understand, and criticize our lives, to improve the meaning of our lives from self-awareness, and to correct all psychological pathologies!</p>

<h3>City Education Association Established, Education Staff Job Center, Schools Can Entrust Personnel Recruitment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Association has recently organized a "Education Staff Job Center" so that qualified unemployed teachers in primary and secondary schools can find positions and focus on education with peace of mind. This is indeed a very important initiative. Unemployment is the most depressing and serious problem, especially for educators. When they are employed, they receive meager salaries and live a hard life. They have no savings, and once they become unemployed, they suffer from hunger. Asking around is not always a solution. Now that there is a special agency for introducing teachers, everyone can first join and register, hoping to obtain a suitable position, so as not to sigh about the vast future and no one to take care of them. On the other hand, it is hoped that if schools and bureaus need to hire teachers of certain subjects, certain grades, full-time or part-time, they should entrust the association's job center to be responsible for recommending them. Anyone who is qualified, teaches diligently, and has considerable teaching experience can be hired. In this way, both the supply and demand sides can obtain satisfactory results. I hope that the morning, industry, commerce, learning, and military departments all have job centers. The first step is to conduct talent registration, investigation, and statistics. The second step is to contact various production and business agencies, and recommend them in as many ways as possible, so that "everyone has a job, and everyone gets what they deserve;" and "as soon as someone asks for someone, everyone gets who they deserve;" It is especially hoped that the government will take the lead and society will promote it. If it can be handled properly, the unemployment problem can be gradually solved, and unnecessary social struggles can also be eliminated. "Everyone has something to do, and everyone has food to eat," this is the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's idea of "everyone doing their best"!</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Request to Restore Streetlights To the Editor: Our factory is located at No. 1125, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai (i.e., Wuding Road). There were streetlights before the war, which was convenient for pedestrians. During the enemy and puppet period, they were destroyed by petty thieves and have not been restored. Moreover, this street is the main road for thousands of residents in the Zhuanbang area, with factories and many Western residences. At night, it is as dark as ink. Not only do collisions and conflicts occur constantly, but also cases of burglary occur from time to time. The reason is nothing more than the lack of streetlights. Now that streetlights have been restored in most places, this lane alone has not been installed. We deeply hope that the wise authorities will install them as soon as possible. We are very grateful. Yuexin Dyeing and Weaving Factory respectfully.</p>
