<h3>遼河西岸</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>三月衷的天氣，在江南該是春意很濃了，但，在這裏却是滿目荒凉，前幾天一塲大雪，更使原野穿上了銀色新裝。</p>
<p>記者在尖銳的寒風裏，踏上從溝帮子走向營口的北寗路支綫「溝營路」。說來可憐，這條鐵路，目前僅是半截通車，到達地點，惟有「胡家」和「盤山」兩站，過去，這條支綫，曾經給過日人南滿綫慘重的打擊，發揮過維護東北交通經濟的作用。</p>
<p>車出溝帮子，第一個觸進限簾的是飛機塲，塲上停留着十幾架日本飛機，飛機裹的機件，已經被拆走了，僅僅留下殘骸，聽任風吹雨蝕。</p>
<p>大地無垠，縱橫的隴畝問，除了去秋遺留下的秧棵短根和成行的土　堆外，再也沒有什麽了，農事開始，還要等待一個時期，從那肥沃油黑的土壤裏，每年都有豐富的收成。</p>
<p>有幾條小河流，穿過了鐵路，橋樑曾遭受破壞，經過了修理後，目前僅是勉强行車，車在橋上，蠕蠕爬行，使人有些提心吊膽。橋頭的房屋，以及沿綫的設備，也都暴露着破壞的痕跡。</p>
<p>誰是破壞者？說來很痛心，在這條路綫上，不是外來的力量，而是自己的共軍，一般常地老百姓，都在說：「祖國打了八年苦仗，東北亡了十四個年顯，加緊建設，尚且趕不上人家，如果這樣下去，我們永遠不能翻身了」！</p>
<p>大雪中火車開進第一站「胡家」，胡家是一個小車站。站長辦公室設在站旁的一個小院落裏，鐵道南有一個長長的村落，那就是「胡家　堡」，住民六七百戶，幾乎完全是農家，日常用品都需跑到溝帮子採辦。鐵道北也有一大排人家，因爲有駐軍，所以新添了一些賣瓜子，花生，白梨和香烟的小販。</p>
<p>車站上停着一列車，車上有一位靑年將領，率領着一批軍事人員，處理維獲交通和地方治安的事務，他們組織了一個自衛隊，同時還在附近各地，辦了六所國民學校，這對於經費困難達於極點的縣府，在推行敎育上，帮了很大的忙。</p>
<p>在風雪中前進，沿綫路口和河流重要地點，都站有持槍的武裝弟兄，情勢顯得有些緊張，聽說比較這一點村莊的村長和人民，都害怕那些便衣隊伍，他們常受難爲，嚴重些還送了性命，因爲，和國軍接近是被指爲「奸逆」的。</p>
<p>到「盤山」了，盤山是一個較大的車站，縣城在鐵道右側，沒有磚城，有的是已經不很顯著的土園子。盤山在前沒有什慶出產，土地荒蕪，人民困窘，設縣很晚，所以沒有什麽名勝</p>
<p>近年不同了，它已經成了一個米產驚人的縣份，日人爲了戰事，爲了人民生活，把盤山荒蕪的碱地開發了，化碱地爲良田，得到了很大的成功，這個地方叫做「大窪」，在縣城北四十里。</p>
<p>盤山多碱地的原因，是受到了臨近海邊的影響，縣城旁就流着一條「碱河」，日人先叫僞滿政府，用筆款收買了大　一帶八萬二千五百「天」地（東北邊的習俗，是把十畝田叫做「「天地」的），然後移去了大批日本和朝鮮農民，從事墾殖。他們用機械，把遼河水汲上來，冲去了碱質，滋潤了田地，試種水稻成了功</p>
<p>因爲開辦不久，又受到了人力和經費的限制，現在僅墾難了二萬七千天地，去年所收的稻子，計為三萬二千噸。這個產米區域，正可作爲我國國營的一個太農塲。</p>
<p>目前那裏有日本農民六千多人，朝鮮人九千人，在技術方面，還有利用他們的必要，所以還不能把他們全部遣送回國。</p>
<p>大窪的大米品質極優，但是去年的存糧，近來已陸續被拉走了，現在正是計劃本年農事的時候·但它是在共軍的手裏，唯一的希望，是已經墾殖了的，千萬不要讓它再碱食荒蕪起來</p>
<p>全縣共有兩個街十六個村，現在縣府控制下的僅有一個縣城——縣城在偽滿街付制裏是一個街——以及西部的七個村，共餘的田莊台街和九個村，都在共軍手裏。</p>
<p>縣府的統計，全縣人口有卅一萬，縣城約佔一萬人，學校計有廿六所，縣城在前有初級和優級小學各一，另有一個農業小學校，現在打算把它改作省立初中，但因爲一切變亂，工作尚待開展。</p>
<p>城街店舖，生意很淸淡，存貨也少，祇有幾家飯館和一些香烟零食小販，在作軍人的生意。</p>
<p>縣西有一個大葦塘，南北長約一百廿里，東西寬約卅餘里，供給錦州紙廠造紙原料，另一部份製造蘆蓆，日人曾設立了一個小型製蓆工廠。</p>
<p>一條通向田莊台和營口的公路，差不多和「溝營」鐵路並行，通過縣境，遙對鐵路橋樑有長廿四五孔的大本橋，在河水正流砌有石座，工程頗大，據云共軍撤退時，本來準備把它燒掉，但因時間關係，幸而留了下來。</p>
<p>縣城週圍，滿佈工事，國共兩軍就在東方二十里內外對峙着，戒備相當森嚴，二月十六日到廿日間，共軍攻擊的「沙嶺」，就是盤山縣城柬六十里，一個七百多人家的小鎭。</p>
<p>盤山縣長金伯起說：「本人在去年十二月十四日到迷縣城，開始接收，日僞將一切移交手續，辦理得很淸楚，故接收工作頗順利，一般縣府留任人員，都以重做中國人爲榮，兩個半月的時間，雖僅借支些許薪資，但仍能高興作事。不幸於一月十三日，縣城被共軍一度攻陷，損失慘重，二月十日，始經國軍克復，重整縣政，但縣府所有，已經一掃而光，事事都大感棘手了！」</p>
<p>雪越下越大，當記者離開縣城西來的時候，積雪已經盈尺了。</p>
<p>（三月五日於溝幫子）</p>
<h3>東北內爭可避免</h3>
<p>蔣主席曾告誡共黨勿塗炭生靈</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕重慶訊：軍息，共軍在東北之軍事試探，政治測騐，已於蘇軍撤退時最後十分鐘失敗，但揷足播種之機會，業不勞而獲，聞軍事調處之三人代表團，即將飛東北視察，此舉共軍殆極表歡迎，因如此旣可以極低廉之代價，白手坐收勝利之果，且可掩飾其在東北軍事脫節宣傳無效之敗徵，準此可觀用軍事調處之方式，澄淸東北局勢，而先消弭內亂，未始非東北人民之福。又今晨消息，蔣主席曾間接誥誠共黨，「勿以些許儲勢武力塗炭生靈，企圖得到內爭勝利，而違背孫總理之期望，今日兩大黨應放遠目光，在大處着眼，勿斤斤於黨派利益，以爲其他政黨之榜樣」，此實金石之言，足予今日在柬北趁火打刦之野心家當頭棒暍，東北內亂可能避免，長哈蘇軍撤退似有待。軍事外交將另部署</p>
<h3>熊張回東北　短期內成行</h3>
<p>軍事外交將另部署</p>

<h3>史達林論邱吉爾演說　阻撓聯合國合作　指邱正煽動對蘇戰爭　邱對史之言拒不作評</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科十三日電〕「眞理報」記者曾請史達林就邱吉爾最近發表之演說，予以評價。史達林當答謂：「余認邱吉爾之目的，在於聯合國間散播不和諧種子，並阻撓聯合國之合作。自和平與安全而言，邱吉爾已採取戰爭煽動者之地位」云</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十三日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播史達林元帥與眞理報記者之談話。據史表示：邱吉爾在美國米蘇里州富爾敦鎭發表之演說，其中涉及波蘭，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞及匈牙利之若干點，係屬撒謊。並稱：邱氏之演說</p>
<p>甚為危險　邱氏主張對蘇戰爭，惟於同時又提議與蘇聯訂立之友好條約五十年，此種條約不免等於具文，毫無價値。蘇聯在此次戰爭中犧牲七百萬人，超過英美兩國合併損失之數。邱吉爾謂波蘭現政府係在蘇聯勢力之下，又謂蘇聯向德國要求太多，此言並非事實。波蘭已選擇一條新道路，不願遵邱氏所指示之方向，此事未免令彼失望。邱氏欲南斯拉夫爲米海洛維支等人及王室所統治，但須知今日共產黨之勢力，乃其次心爭取國家自由所得之結果。邱氏對於演說中提及普通人民，彼在英國即被普通人民排斥去位，今全歐皆有此等行動，當然非邱氏所喜。邱氏昔日嘗欲組織對蘇「十字軍」，此舉能否成功，不能令人無疑。惟邱氏此種演說乃一危險行動，目的係在各國間撒播分裂種子，阻碍繼續合作。邱氏此時正在參加彼不僅在英國有人與之聲應氣求，即在美國亦然。但有必須指出者，因邱氏及其友人，使人回想到希特勒及其友人。希特勒採用種族學說以確立其戰爭主義，宣言祇有操日耳曼語者爲純粹之民族，邱吉爾亦以種族學說被　戰爭，對於英語民族與以特權，並與以決定全世界命運之權利。日耳曼民族論使希特勒派以爲被等乃有權統治他國之惟一民族，今邱吉爾派亦稱英語各國須爲全世界之最高統治者。邱吉爾及其在英美兩國之友人，現正向非英語各國提出一種最後通牒曰：「你們若自動承認我們的優越權，則一切無事，否則不免戰爭」。各國人民</p>
<p>流血五載　係爲爭取國家自由與獨立，非僅以希特勒之統治易取邱吉爾之統治。今非英語國家代表全世界人口之大多數，其不願成爲新奴隸殊易瞭解，而邱氏竟不能明瞭此簡聲明白之眞理，此乃邱氏之悲劇。考邱氏之目的，顯爲發動對蘇戰爭，惟一方面演說對蘇戰爭，一方面又提議延長英蘇友好條約至五十年，推其用意，無非視條約爲具文，僅欲藉此掩人耳目，以隱蔽其反蘇活動而已。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十四日電〕邱吉爾對史達林向眞理報訪員發表之談話，拒絕評論。</p>
<h3>蘇坦克車專家　在伊朗何為？</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十四日電〕可靠方面息：蘇聯坦克專家巴格拉米安，現在亞塞爾拜然之首邑大不列士。</p>
<h3>社論　中東風雲的緊急</h3>
<p>在東北的局勢依然陰霾重重的今日，從中東方而傳來的消息，又使我們感到中柬風雲的緊急。從土耳其到伊朗，局勢的嚴重性日益在增加着。據聯合社德黑蘭十三日電，據最可靠方面消息，蘇軍正沿伊朗北部向西南方土耳其，伊拉克邊境一帶移動，蘇軍戰率及裝甲車已開入離德黑蘭二十哩之克拉齊。亞塞爾拜然省傳來消息，蘇軍騎兵一隊正自裏海岸之阿斯脫拉市向伊朗作扇形推進。配備整齊之蘇軍業已開入烏爾米亞湖南端附近之米阿奈，馬拉格及米亞陶勒。該湖位於伊拉克與土耳其交界處。另據本報訊：倫敦十三日廣播伊朗駐蘇大使阿勒今稱，蘇聯對土耳其之壓力，已越過神經戰之階段，預料土耳其邊境即將發生戰事。又據合衆社華盛頓十二日電：據美國務院所獲情報，最近又有蘇聯軍隊及重武器配備自蘇聯邊境經大不列士向德黑蘭方面移動。從上面這些報道，可知蘇聯的軍事行動自土耳其伊拉克邊境以迄伊朗的北部，顯係一種有計劃而具有規模的行動。察其用意，似不以伊朋爲其僅有對象，實包括自土耳其以迄伊朗的一個廣大區域。</p>
<p>關於伊朗問題，英美曾數度向蘇聯提出照會，且曾一度提出於聯合國首届安全理事會。安全理事會爲伊朗問題曾有過四天的激辨，最後並有蘇伊直接交涉的決定。可是這決定，並不曾解次了出現在伊朗的問題。蘇聯軍隊的占領伊朗北境，原是對軸心作戰的一種必要揹施，今戰事旣了，理應撤退，使伊朗能够自由行使它的政權。但蘇軍不但不撤，近且在亞塞爾拜然省進行分化運動，轉使伊朗局勢，益趨複雜。如今聯合國安全理事會旣有蘇伊直接交涉的決定，而伊朗現政權又不能容於蘇聯，以是直接交涉迄未能有進展。此次蘇軍向伊朗的推進，誠如聯合社華盛頓十三日常所云，旨在强迫伊朗成立親蘇政府，鞏固其邊境軍略地帶。</p>
<p>然而這次蘇軍的推動，其範圍却不止限於伊朗，並包括有土耳其邊境伊拉克邊境一帶地。蘇聯與土耳其及伊拉克的爭執，表面上爲的是寇迪許族自治及「收回邊境失地」的要求。寇迪許族的自治問題，蘇聯在表面上雖爲局外，但幕後牽綫或所難免。收　邊境失地，是在算陳年舊帳，此在土耳其當然不有輕易將其國土予以轉讓分割。何况這裏面的間題又不是如此簡單。伊拉克的報達白斯拉出海可通印度洋，其地又有豐富的油地。土耳其握有韃靼尼爾海峽，爲黑海出地中海的門戶。蘇軍此番的行動，與其說在企圖收回邊境的失地，無寗說是在對土耳其使用壓力以取得韃靼尼爾海峽權利；迫使土耳其伊拉克成立親蘇政權。</p>
<p>中東的問題雖出現在伊朗，伊拉克，及土耳其；但事實上却只有一個；就是一個强大的隣邦企圖以武力在各該地成立與本身有利的政權。這顯與民族自主的原則有背。如果這種政策得到實現，那這次爲大戰而犧牲的無數人民，他們所不惜以血來爭的原則，均將被棄，世界將重復回到一個黑暗時代。所以關於中東方面的局勢不是一個英蘇爭霸的問題，實是一個更重要的問題，就是民族的自主生存，與恃强凌弱的問題。爲了這個問題，人類有這次大戰；現在戰事甫終，這個問題却又在各處出現，從地中海，中歐，經近東以迄太平洋岸的東北。中東最近的發展，是可以注意的；這裏蘊藏着危險。中國經過長期的抗戰，對於戰爭的不可分割，感覺尤其親切。星星之火，可以燎原。如何挽救人類再遭逢浩刦，端在當前領導人物的遠大風度。</p>
<h3>英美輿論一致　抨擊史達林談話　認史氏言論粗暴而不合理　其行動則亦與希特勒相似</h3>
<p>美</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日專電〕史達林對邱吉爾之演說予以攻擊後，紐約時報特撰論稱：蘇如願予邱吉爾以有效之答覆，莫斯科所需作者乃遵守其與其他國家所作之保證，協定及條約。如此整個國際緊張局勢，均將因此而立刻變爲烏有。紐約時報繼提醒蘇謂：蘇聯如認美國國會對邱吉爾演說所表示之躊躇態度，乃分裂英美友好關係之機會，則屬錯誤。</p>
<p>英</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕保守黨之每日郵報及每日紀事報，今晨曾批評史達林對眞理報記者發表之談話，每日郵報稱：史達林元帥親自對邱吉爾濫施侮辱，實爲可鄙而遺憾之舉，此非政治家應有之言，聞其言可以想見其爲人，渠少闡述目前之國際危機，僅能解釋世界之緊張局面，係因蘇聯之强權政治侵略鄰邦而造成，但不能免除蘇聯之責任。蘇聯之行動，堪與第三次世界大戰前之局勢相比擬，伊朗之局面，實已回復一九三八－一九三九之歐洲政局之面目，當時之捷克，即今日之伊朗，所差者，今日之發展較前更速耳。蘇聯之行動，且有更甚於戰前之德國者，希特勒允許尊重慕尼黑會議所議定之疆界，然六閱月後，即興師長入波希米亞，摩拉維亞；蘇聯允許與英國同時撤退駐伊朗之軍隊，然竟違約。希特勒與史達林更有一不幸的相似點，即均以安全爲辭，解釋其侵略行動。何人能攻蘇聯？</p>
<p>每日紀事報稱：惟英國之外交技能及聯合國機構之道義壓力，可以避免另一戰爭，不幸史達林之攻擊邱吉爾，並未能减輕局勢之緊張性。史達林之言，粗暴而不合理，須知濫施侮辱，決不能答覆邱吉爾所提出之各點，渠以希特勒比擬邱吉爾，簡直難以令人糧信，誠非對德作戰三巨頭少一應有之態度。</p>
<h3>三巨頭會議說　白宮秘書已予否認</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日合衆電〕杜魯門之報界秘書羅斯今日稱：外傳杜魯門總統正籌劃另一三巨頭會議，「並不甚確」。是項傳言之來源，由於參院外交委會表示願與貝爾納斯討論三張之緊張關係，且曾與前駐蘇大使哈立曼舉行秘密會議。記者以下列各傳聞詢問羅斯：（一）總統是否擬設法召開三巨頭會議。（二）總統是否已於艾總禮通電話？是否擬與史達林直接通話？（三）若蘇聯不撤退伊境蘇軍，美是否將與蘇聯斷絕外交關係？羅斯對以上各問題俱未作答。</p>
<p>〔路透社十四日倫敦電〕英議員有請艾總禮首相答覆渠是否擬發起召開三巨頭會議者。首相謂渠將採取任何足以改進諸强關係之步驟，惟在目前猶未便有所措施。</p>
<h3>南國覬覦義領土　義邊境局勢緊張　英艦駛抵特港增強防務　義車三師駐守維尼齊亞</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十四日電〕據保守派「義大利新聞報」載稱：義大利軍隊三師，其中兩師曾在義大利戰役中與聯軍駢肩作戰，開已開到維尼齊亞戈里埃省（該區爲南斯拉夫所覬覦）。負責方面對於此說，旣不否認亦不證實。同時該報並稱，英國巡洋艦一艘已開到義大利特里埃斯特港，增強該港防務，聯合國空軍亦已開始飛越伊宋柴流域上空。</p>
<p>〔法國新開社特里埃斯特城十三日電〕本日此間有羣衆約一萬兩千人，在市政府各辦公盧之前舉行示威運動，並歡呼南斯拉夫總統兼內閣總理蒂托元帥之名。同時義大利民族委員會，以解放維尼齊亞戈里埃區爲宗旨，亦於本日開會，決定舉行示威運動，答復親南示威運動。又義大利及史洛文同盟委員會昨日曾向聯合國調查委員會提出備忘錄一件，籲請南斯拉夫合併特里埃斯特全區及伊宋查省，以便組成南斯拉夫聯邦之第九邦。其提議之疆界，顯然越過摩根舊邊界綫之西，將義大利數處村莊與本土切斷。此外，美國方面傳稱，南斯拉夫軍隊已通過或企圖通過摩根邊界綫之說，頃由聯合國當局加以否認。</p>
<h3>美答覆蘇指責　中東駐軍問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國陸軍今日答覆蘇聯對美軍留駐埃及之責難稱：一俟該區內之剩餘配備處置妥當後，即將計劃完全退出非洲及中東。該項公告中指出目下尚價價値一萬萬元之剩餘物資尚未處置妥當。</p>
<h3>印荷談判　嚴守秘密</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十四日電〕印荷談判嚴守秘密，高級當局復令各報記者對談判內容不可妄自揣測，蓋宣布過早，有碍談判成功故也。昨日之會談爲時僅半小時，料沙利總理曾提出妥協之建議。官方文告謂：會談時由寇爾爵士任主席，印荷雙方曾作有用之交換意見，今後數日內將繼續召開會議。</p>

<h3>商討今後救濟計劃　聯總召開會議　胡佛可能繼任署長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署四十七國代表，定於星期五在新澤西州大西洋城舉行會議，歐洲救濟計劃是否能延長至明年，將爲討論主要問題。總署救濟款項至明年三月將完全用罄，而明年一二三月所有救濟費已規定全部用於遠東各國，尤其是中國。善救總署現擬避免要求聯合各國再作第三次捐款，其理由則爲美國會恐不喜再有十三億五千萬元之第三年連續捐款。本届大西洋城會議對於此事如無解決辦法，亦有提交聯合國大會之可能。另一希望則在國際銀行如能及時組成，則或可於今年底放出糧食及善後借款</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕聯合國善救總署署長李門，以體弱多病爲由，已於昨日呈請辭職，茲據「新聞晚報」紐約通訊員所發消息，美國前任總統胡佛可能繼李門之後，出任　聯總署長，按胡氏現任糧荒救濟特委會主席。</p>

<h3>杜剛被害案嫌疑　黃烈文否認通敵且說有功於國　張玉麟女士　目睹書密報　頭背十餘刀右手被砍</h3>
<p>杜夫人訴說傷心嗚咽不能成語</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕已故前市黨部委員兼書記長杜剛，字少文，抗戰期間，歷任黨政要職，奔走各地。三十二年春奉命秘密來滬，策劃工作，不幸爲敵偵悉，於是年十一月十日在蒲石路六七二弄二十八號寓所與夫人陸惠民同時被捕，監禁於敵貝當路憲兵隊內，非刑拷打，逼取口供。杜烈士矢志不厲，卒於十一月十七日被害，壯烈殉國。夫人後經釋出。勝利後，經偵悉黃烈文有通敵嫌疑，遂加逮捕，移送高檢處偵查，已經正式提起公訴。黃烈文係松江人，三十八歲，早年歷任中央軍政高級職務，抗戰期間奉命來滬，招募軍校第二十期學生，道經屯溪時，曾與杜有</p>
<p>一面之緣</p>
<p>來滬工作後，被敵憲拘捕，監禁六月始釋，即留居在滬，三十三年間由周佛海之介紹，出任僞靑浦縣長，直至勝利時爲止。而杜之所以彼捕殉難，即出自黃之密報，有張玉麟女士目睹可證。黃因密報有功，除得任縣長外，並由敵憲賞予住宅車輛米粉等物。該案昨日下午在高院特別刑庭，由蔡晋推事開庭提訊時，被告</p>
<p>滔滔申辯</p>
<p>堅不承認有密報某害杜剛之事。稱自來滬被捕獲釋後，即爲監視，脫身不得，敵僞曾一再威逼供出地下工作負責人蔣伯誠·吳紹澍·杜剛等下落，均推稱在屯溪。杜剛之寓所我根本不知，何來密報。至出任僞靑浦縣長事，曾得負責當局同意。利用職務，掩護地下工作。將第三戰區通訊電台設於縣府內，又將當地僞保安隊改爲第三戰區先逍軍，更勸誘改編金山松江兩縣之部隊。同時將被捕被囚之地下工作同志絡續釋放，先後有一白餘名，可請調查。如社烈士確由我所杏，願當庭自殺，以謝國人，。同時並要求傳訊貝當路敵憲兵隊長杉原中佐及宮本少尉等作證。繼由杜陸惠明詳細陳述</p>
<p>被難經過</p>
<p>稱，張玉麟女士曾目睹被告作　密報。曾述及杜烈士死後頭背部有刀痕數十處，右手被砍之慘狀時，悲從中來，痛哭失聲，嗚咽不能成語。因張玉麟未到，庭上於傳訊經黃烈文營救釋放之地下工作人員沈志衍後，諭令案情尚待調查，改期再訊。</p>
<h3>方傑等四案</h3>
<p>僞上海市警局特高科政治股股員方傑，曾助敵拘捕平湖忠救軍隊員及剛勝利時在黄埔電台廣播此項消息之國民黨黨員等，此案昨日開庭時，由被害人孔上吼·蔡志俊·朱麗文·劉寳椿等到庭陳述經過，被告延蔣保　律師辯護，庭諭押候改期再訊。</p>
<p>昨晨高院並審訊王明遷·金運生·吳泉根·喬書林等四人被控充任貝常路敵憲兵隊密探一案，被告係由上海縣北橋區鄉民喬良伯·朱錫卿·陳棟國·喬雋山·朱漢臣等告發，經質詢之下，諭令改期再訊。</p>
<p>又僞山東威海衛警局特高科思想股股長及僞定海縣警局副局長趙日亮一案，昨日下午開會議庭辯論，被告延王壽安律師辯護庭諭辯論終結，廿一日下午宣判。</p>

<h3>三木遂免一死　判徒刑廿五年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前曾在瀋陽附近美軍集中營充管理員之日戰犯三木遂，昨經美軍法庭宣判徒刑二十五年，並服勞役。宣判歷時僅三分鐘。但被控告殺害美海軍戰俘鐘氏罪名，則因證據未足，未能成立，故其罪名只僞虐打及苛待戰俘。三木聆判前，面色灰白，惶恐畏懼之狀畢露，旣判之後，雖較安定，然恐懼緊張之狀，猶不滅也。</p>

<h3>外灘廣大華行　巨藕案破獲</h3>

<h3>洽購活動房屋萬幢　有此一說</h3>
<p>本市屋荒問題，極爲嚴重，一時尚無適當解決辦法，以致房主房客間時常發生糾紛事件。據新滬通訊社報導稱，此次美軍在太平洋方面之剩餘物資中，有活動房屋一萬幢，現已由我國政府正式向美國政府洽購中。並悉其中大部份將供京滬兩地應用，以備供給作還都後公務員之住宅，則此後京滬之屋荒問題，或可稍獲解決云。</p>
<h3>泰山公寓屋頂上　艷屍案眞相大白</h3>
<p>重溫舊夢·醋海興波·人命一塲　輾轉擒拿獲共犯主兇在逃</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕霞飛路六二二弄三號泰山公寓四樓屋頂，十日下午四時餘發現艷裝女屍一具，詳情迭誌本報，一時社會哄動，認爲奇事。該管盧家彎警局甚爲重視，偵騎四出，晝夜查緝，果在四十餘小時內將共犯擒獲，主犯在逃，各情彙誌於次：</p>
<p>是日斯案發生盧家灣分局據報後，當由酈俊厚副局長親率巡官薛敏傑·倪家鳳·股員馬秉璋·警長張鈞等至出事地點詳勘。並硏究死者之傷痕，檢查槍壳之種類。由爲股員認明死者曾與馬在宴會中會晤一次，僅記憶她寓在卡德路附近，不詳其號數。窮數小時之招尋，始訪晤其夫岳年釗於卡德路一四六弄三十三號。其時岳尚未悉其妻陳蕙芳之慘死。據岳云：渠因失業，生計日艱，蕙芳迫於經濟，於廢曆正月廿四日至會樂里紅珍珠書寓重爲馮婦，取名老七。</p>
<p>於是警員根據此綫索，直往紅珍珠書寓詳查。據鴇母云：上星期四有一陳姓客來此茶會，臨去時調老七云，明日在此請客，請備菜肴。詎知翌日五時，陳姓者忽來一電話，因膀子跌壞，請客展期，老七聆斯語，頓時不悅。旋因其友林步武（又名一鳴）在大中華咖啡館招其一敘王正中並卜姓兩人來寓「做花頭」，又以電話約薛姓張姓兩人來共宴。客散時，林向卜借三萬元以償筵席費用。下兩日老七忽又出門，就此未　。</p>
<p>倪巡官等知欲破此案，必從書實開始，故於案發後數往書寓偵訪，至十一日下午六時，又往時，適薛某來一電話，約七往大中華吃咖啡，警員即馳至大中華將薛捕獲，訊悉王林兩人殊可疑，但不知住處，僅訊知林與女子林蕙英相姘，而蕙英之姊則住於杜神父路，經往將蕙英之姊尋獲，因此又悉林在滬西憶定盤路逸安邨廿七號。</p>
<p>警員翌日往逸安邨叩詢廿七號二房東，據云林先生偕眷今晨擬赴蘇州。此時王林忽相偕進弄，經薛指認無誤，由股員馬秉璋奮勇瘵五抱住，王擬出槍開放未果，復被倪巡官猛擊，槍械落地，常塲就擒。林一嗚則卒被於人叢中逸去。警員將諸人帶局，嚴密盤詢，始明瞭此殺人案之經過。</p>
<p>蓋薛爲七之舊情人，長夜相遇又訝又喜，詢七何以至此，七告以其夫年釗失業，率出無奈。是夜出書寓後，薛與七即偕至旅舍幽會，因此林·王等對七深表不滿，相約翌晨在某處吃茶，商議對付方針，蓋殺七之念已油然而生矣。</p>
<p>翌日，林王先至泰山公萬盤桓多時，旋各回去。至十日下午一時許，相約在西　路大三元午膳，並電邀老七，七不疑有他，欣然而至。食畢，林王携七　街車三輛，同往泰山公寓，以訪友爲由，直登四樓平頂，見四顧無人，即由林出檢開放一響未中，機發一彈，命中其面部，倒地殞命。常時七戴有大小鑽戒二枚，大者重量六十分，小者四粒頭一枚，又法幣七千元，均由林攫取而逸。兩人乘車至漢口路某珠寳號，將大鑽戒出售，得洋三十五萬元，小者售於江西路某號，得法幣十五萬元。林當給予王三萬元。十一日王至憶定盤路逸安邨廿七號王寓進中膳，林又給其七萬元，並可嚀嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>十二日晨林見申報已載泰山公寓命案，即向二房東謂，擬赴蘇州，一面即携報紙往姚主敎路一六一號訪王，告以事已敗露，商量同逃。旋林與王同返逸安邨，擬摒擋一切出走，詎即於此時被捕。據王供，林犯三十七歲，福建人，曾在廣東警官學校卒業，現任崑山縣政府保安團第二大隊少校隊附，精於槍術·警員又至林之寓所一度抄搜，竟無長物，當時酈副分局長恐其逃往外埠，迅至靜安寺分局保甲處將林之肖像出，派警往軍站守候，迄今雖未緝獲，然終難逃法綱也。</p>

<h3>勞益爾招待記者　報告物資清理情形　二千萬美金物資將售與我國　錢市長昨在私邸為勞民洗塵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美陸軍次長勞益爾及國外淸理委員會專員麥凱勃等，組織之美軍剩餘物資調查團，昨日上午，在建設大厦八樓與美軍駐華當局有所會談。至十一時二十分會畢，繼續招待本市各報記者，報告淸理國外物資情形，由勞益爾次長，麥凱勃，美陸軍服務隊司令羅次中將，陸軍部聯絡處處長派克斯少將，及駐華國外淸理委員會會長强生少將等出席答覆各問題。</p>
<p>調查戰區剩餘物資</p>
<p>勞氏稱該調查團主要任務，乃視察太平洋各戰區美軍剩餘物資。美軍所餘物品，經常局訂名爲剩餘物資後，即歸國外淸理委員負責處理及出售。如有美國方面必需之物品，則仍將運回。一部份軍火亦可出售，但尚有一部份軍器，固具危險性質，故已擲入海中。</p>
<p>清理委會協助運輸</p>
<p>日前估計太平洋區剩餘物資總值，頗爲困難，但加爾各答方面，有二千五百萬美金之物資，將悉數售與中國。剩餘物資購買優先權，第一爲美國各機關，第二爲聯合國善後救濟總署，其次爲中國·現除中國外，尚有荷蘭及新西蘭等國要求購置，但爲數不多，蘇聯尚未申請。至運輸方面，本應由購買國自理，但淸理委會決設法盡力協助·勞氏等定今日離此赴馬尼刺繼續考察。錢大鈞市長特於昨日下午五時半在極司非爾路私邸舉行鷄尾酒會，爲勞氏等洗塵。</p>
<p>美記者團參加視察</p>
<p>最近抵滬之美記者團，紐約時報韋說奈，紐約自由論壇報克利奈，支加哥論壇報克拉克，時代雜誌麥克諾頓及國際新聞處漢利五人，昨日下午四時，在建設大厦八樓招待本市記者，哥倫比亞廣播公司胡特雅特未到，合衆社狄倫則因事飛往重慶一行。據云此來任務，乃受美海陸軍當局之托，視察太平洋各區剩餘物資情形，以便報告。行期共三週，此行與陸軍次長勞益爾等來此並無關係，又謂中國區內，實際並無多量剩餘物資，但實爲出售太平洋剩餘物資之良好市塲·美剩餘物資賣與中國者，已有八百七十萬美元，大琉球島美軍剩餘物資甚多，將設法運華出賣。記者團定十六日晨離此赴馬尼刺。</p>

<h3>本市市長「底薪」　每月八百元　公務員待遇等級一覽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公務員待遇，前經行政院通過調整，按底薪加一百三十倍，及生活津貼四萬元，但此項公事至今猶未批下。據有關方面猜測，可能將再度改變，日前市府職員待遇，仍按底薪一百倍計算，並加生活津貼三萬元。茲將待遇等級摘錄於下：</p>
<p>特任</p>
<p>災民（市長）每月底薪為八百元。</p>
<p>簡任</p>
<p>一級（如局長及與各局相等地位之處長等，）月薪六百八十元。簡任共分八級，自四百三十元起至六百八十元，每級相差三十元。</p>
<p>薦任</p>
<p>共分十二級，自一百八十元起至四百元，每級相差二十元。科長最高爲薦任一級。</p>

<h3>大雨滂沱結隊請願　旅館·水木　兩業工潮解決　旅館茶役工資增加六成　水木工人決定今日復業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕旅館工潮昨日在社會局兩度折衝後，已告解決，一萬五千茶房下午一時即行復工。和解筆錄，將於今日上午十時簽訂，經過情形如次：</p>
<p>冒雨鵠候卒告解決</p>
<p>昨晨八時半旅館工役八千餘人，高擊布幟，上書旅館業職業工會，列隊至社會局請願，要求工次照原薪增加七成。爲表示眞誠起見，全體不張雨傘，站於滂沱之大雨中，毫不畏縮。而資方則以爲房價所漲並非每家皆有七成，故工資自不能一律。後由社會局顧炳元處長勸解，應允勞方代表工資可以增加六成，而炎方之房價問題允於下午再加討論。全體茶房認爲滿意，故下午即行復工。惟下午四時討論房價時，又生變化，警局代表以爲工資所增過高，房價勢必隨之高漲，則旅客負担過鉅。故六成之說，勢必又遭推翻。但勞方一致反對，幾度商討辯論，結果由顧處長解次，茶役加薪仍維持六成原議，旅館房價允加五成。調解筆錄將於今日上午十時簽字。</p>
<p>社局決定臨時措置</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕水木作工潮相特已近一週，因工人大都家無隔宿之糧，以日得工資，維持一家生活，實不堪再事拖延。全市十萬工友，亟求解次，遊行請願無日無之，昨日下午五時，數千工人因久候不得赴社會局出席談判五代表之回音，乃又結隊趕至社會局。其時雨勢正大，社會局之中央大廣塲瞬即成爲傘海。工人要求社會局立即解次，而資方代表四人，以爲工資已經調整（日薪二千六百元），故勞方六千三百元之要求難以接受。且同業衆多，不敢遽行答應，態度殊爲堅次。社會局鑒於形勢嚴重，工人情緒緊張，誠恐發生變化，乃採取臨時措置。由社會局命令工人於今日起全體復工，同時命令資方在未正式解次前，每日工資發給四千五百元·一俟正式決定後，多還少補。勞資雙方對此臨時辦法，皆欣然接受，六時半工人等相率散去。</p>
<p>又本市工務局修理道路橋樑，雇用工人，積極從事建設工作？水木業工會對於該項來入會工人，竟有千涉阻撓情形。社會局吳局長據報後，於日昨嚴令告誡該工會，對於未入會工人，不得有干涉阻撓情事，更不得對政府工作人員有遝法行動，否則，即予嚴懲。</p>
<p>自來水廠工人請願</p>
<p>楊樹浦自來水廠工頭十數人，昨赴社會局　請調解。緣太平洋戰爭初起時，該廠經理曾與工人協定，工人於戰時不離職守，資方答應於戰後每人發給賞金三個月薪津。但勝利後資方忽又反悔。不履行諾言，故要求社會局協助向資方催討云。</p>
<p>書業職工表未關切</p>
<p>商務印書館怠工日久，迄未有解決辦法，引起同業中華·世界·等各書局職工之不安。已聯名呈文社會局，速即調處，否則同業恐將連帶受影饗云。</p>
<h3>市內軍用車速率準加高　路人與駕駛員均須謹慎</h3>
<p>〔合衆社訊〕據中國戰區司令部今日發表之公告稱：該司令部將假美軍之大美電台開始「行車安全」宜傳節目，以期减少本市內之車輛肇禍事件·大美電台每日將廣播種種節目，促使行路人與開車者特別謹慎，因今後所有軍用車輛已獲準以每小時十八英里之速率駛行。據稱：美國軍用車輛行駛速率前曾規定為每小時十三英里，但因構造士關係，上述速率易使車輛損壞，市政府爲解除此項困難起見，已同意將行駛速率改爲每小時十八英里云。</p>
<p>海宙輪週一駛台</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局爲加速滬台運輸起見，曾派海湘輪行駛，後該輸改駛靑島，又另派海宇·海宙兩輪加入航行。海宇約明日司起椗，海宙定十八日駛台。至合北輪現正在起卸來貨，航期未定，聞台灣省行政長官公署經與該局商妥，已購定海湘合北兩輪船票之工作人員，均得改乘海宙輪，前往台灣，母庸換票。</p>
<h3>契稅土地稅　將移專徵收</h3>
<p>遺產稅徵收困難</p>
<p>現由市財政局徵收之契稅及土地稅，於最近期內將移交上海直接稅局接管徵收。該局局長孫照烜，將與江蘇直接稅局長時壽彰對調，時氏定於下週接事，又遺產稅之徵收，極爲困難，因本市戶口調查猶未就緒，市民財產登記亦未辦理，故直接稅局方面，無法調查市民之死亡及其遺產，致自成立以來，遺產稅之徵收，因工作未能開展，致其數額亦極微細。</p>
<h3>增收電話保證金　每綫七千五百元</h3>

<h3>黃金買戶裏足　配給居然收效　滙價仍未動</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續闌珊，中行以一六〇萬之價配售一七五條，同行竟有不予接納之槪，且此價當日繼續有效，上漲之門巳遭關閉，買戶裹足不前，市况萬分疲靜，晨開平盤，一六三萬供源不斷，遂退入一六〇萬火關，十時後仍在一五九萬以下掙扎，業中對登記配給，畏縮不前，登記者極少，中行定價高於市價少許，聲言需要者可保留至今日下午，否則聽便，是以此後即遭供方所壓制，買戶興趣毫無，旁觀而已，午刻已微挫至一五五萬左右，午後稍形穩定，在一五七萬左右盤旋，交易不多，結果較前日再低六萬左右，銀樓飾金掛十七萬元，紋銀一千六，銀元稍低九〇〇元有賣，暗拆鬆動，息價自一角半至二角。</p>
<p>外幣亦呈閑散，美鈔隨金價同降，自晨初二〇五〇元光景，迄難有些徵之振作，午刻已迫近二〇〇〇元大關而後稍定，午後亦然，結果再跌廿元，港票昨以環境不利，亦形軟化，港電供給轉殷，老票遂亦帶小五元，新貨平平，中行沒匯未更，港票四二〇元至四三五元，羅比五二〇元至五四〇元，供求漸形平衡。</p>
<p>中行拋售金條統計</p>
<p>中央銀行自上週四起，至昨日止，共計配售黃金二千二百八十三條，價格最高一百七十五萬元，最低一百六十五萬元，計收縮通貨達四十五萬八千八百五十萬元，配售對象爲金業公會會員金號及銀樓六十三家，如需要黃金，每日上午十時向中行塡具申請購買額，經中行核准後，限於午前繳款提貨，以免向市塲投機取巧，如昨日本向中行由請一百七十五條價爲一百六十萬元，旋見市面吸胃殊弱，兼有吐售者，於是有請求取消之事發生，金市亦由是而益趨疲軟，上午價格由一百六十三萬元回低至一百五十萬元，下午復小四五萬元。</p>
<h3>冷門小股獨俏</h3>
<p>統債又盤跌　外股亦平疲</p>
<p>公債初穩繼疲，業中多頭抬高後，一致出籠，是以丙種自晨初二〇元大關盤旋而下，午刻退入一八〇〇元內，結果雜牌無甚榮辱，丙種回跌五十元，華股在高峰徘徊，此乃連朝上漲後，應有之現象，大戶供過於求，一部份人出熱門掉進次熱及小型股，同時小型股若新光等本身努力，大有後來居上之勢，永紗晨開四千元，美亞三千，景福二百元，開後一度回落半成，新光自一七〇元逐步邁進，勤興得其不少助力，游資放棄金鈔後，苦無出路，不久重又歸來，永紗美亞得以恢椱舊觀，午刻大股穩定，小股走勢仍俏，景福見二一五元，新光二〇〇元，勤興一六〇元而後略轄平定，午收結果較前日大股平平，景福好起七元，新光獨漲二十元，勤興亦然，冷門小股漸漸有人垂靑，午後熱門隔日交割，喊價稍高，外股受金價軟化影響，持有者脫貨套利，晨開雖平，難於持久，午收較華股爲早，市况平疲，較前收怡紗英聯因熱門之故，回跌少許，其餘各股無甚出入。</p>
<h3>紗銷漸歸平談　紡建兩組投標</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍無起色，二十支現貨籌碼供應有人，而客路需要不多，加以金價又落，是以各支紗綫又降五六萬元，十六支光明跌勢較緩，祇降三萬，午時紡建公司掛牌標售，自一支起至六十支止，共二十種之多，聞業中人心思平淡，故承購者並不像以往之踴躍，又紡建公司另用投標方式，將六支十支粗紗及十六支二十支紗，分兩組招標放賭，於下午三時開標，第一組由公和棉織廠標得，第之組有五家投標，均未能達到該公司最低限價，故無得主，此亦紗業買賣中別開生面者云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉，近期報漲十八磅音，計美金二七·一五，遠期不動，計二六·五五，米特林現貨二七·三一，本埠現棉交易，較爲减色，緣黃金與紗價賡續下游，紡建公司忽存觀望，未有採辦，僅民營紗廠如申新紗廠稍有購進，價與上日相仿。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市面，受天雨影響，本街客帮，均甚寥落，趨勢極形平庸。</p>
<h3>紡紗利息好　復工逐漸多</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區華商紗廠，現時共有五十三廠，總計紗錠百七十萬，線錠十近萬，布機萬五千架，最近業已復工者，紗錠已超過半數，計百分之五十五，線錠計百分之四十六，惟布機開工者，尚僅百分之二十六。各廠大部在上海，計三十五廠，其餘十六廠在江蘇境內無錫·常州·江陰·太倉·嘉定及南通·崇明·海門等地，浙皖境內，僅杭州及蕪湖各一廠。就中復工紗錠以申新九廠爲最多，計六萬六千錠，線錠復工者首推鴻章廠，計九千六百錠，布機亦以鴻章復工爲多計五九四台。照今日紗價與花價比較，相差殊大，如以每件棉紗用棉花三百六十斤，照棉花每担九萬元市價計算，再加工料，則每件棉紗成本富不及五十萬元，最近棉紗市價在百萬元左右，足以刺激生產，預料短期內可全部復工。</p>
<h3>美棉到二千噸</h3>
<p>天祥洋行經理之Samwater蘇威脫號，昨由紐約來滬，運來棉花二千噸，計八千件，泊十六十七號浮筒起卸，該棉係美安洋行採購，該輪專裝此棉來華。</p>

<h3>米又回漲</h3>
<p>米市昨又以陰雨，人心趨挺，粳米加五六百元，秈米貨少，加近千元，白元則物稀爲貴猛漲，無正式市價，麵粉略見疲勢，黃豆亦少成交，高貨回小五六百元，豆餅去胃仍淡，再小二三百元，汕市店胃仍懈，生油貨多，欲漲無力，早堅午疲，豆汕貨稀形堅，生仁定局，麩皮亦彷彿。</p>
<h3>世界麥產銳減</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十四日電〕據美農業部國外農業組宣稱：一九四五年世界小麥產量陸五，二〇〇·〇〇〇，〇〇〇布塞爾，爲一九二九年以來最小之產量，較諸一九四四年，亦減低百份之八，產量銳減原因，係除北美與亞洲之外，各地產量普遍滅低之故，按北美與亞洲之小麥產量，雖較一年前爲小，但已在水準以上，產量最小之處係在歐洲，在該方面，一九四五年之產量僅一，〇三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇布塞爾，較戰前減少百份之三十六</p>

<h3>薄馬口鐵軋缺</h3>
<p>三十五磅薄鐵，在馬口鐵中向稱貴族品，惟香烟廠味精廠及顏料行等用度較鉅，其他僅有零星需要，市上存貨，十分淺薄，不料最近鞋帶工塲，驟然購進數箱，因此本街底貨軋緊，而海外定貨，一時尚難來滬，於是有現貨者必欲待善價而沽，日昨單連每箱以五十萬元開出，雙連以張數較多，售六十萬元。</p>
<h3>燃料漲風漸戢</h3>
<p>煤市趨勢漸見平穩，各貨均無上落，市塲交易亦因天雨遜色不少，連熱門之白煤篩塊，亦鮮成交，僅白煤小子及柴炭尚有零星點綴，烟煤屑各方流出頗多，傳各生產工廠將有平價配給訊，致去路轉呆，但售價方面，賣主猶力圖扳持，未肯廉脫，仍站原盤云。</p>
<h3>工業原料到滬</h3>
<p>本市工業原料存底薄弱，因之價格猛漲，尤以燒碱漂精及鞣皮之紅礬等，因用途浩繁，幾瀕匱乏。聞最近由加爾各答運滬定貨一批，計有卜內門月牌燒碱·純碱·漂粉精·紅礬等，故上項市價略呈疲軟，惟照實際需要，仍感不敷。</p>

<h3>利用戰爭剩餘品　交換留學生　美參院軍委會通過法案</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日專電〕美參院軍事委會，已通過法案，利用美在外之戰爭剩餘品之債權，以與各外國交換留學生，俾使大砲之武器，轉爲文化之交流。僉信此舉將更加推動國際間之瞭解及友誼。提案人以退還庚款，設立淸華大學爲喩，指出共値三十億美元之戰爭剩餘物資，亦將加以最佳之利用，以建立善意與友誼。</p>
<h3>晏陽初博士　倡導識字運動</h3>
<p>在美對記者表示意件</p>
<p>〔國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕中國著名敎育家晏陽初博士，日昨在美最高法院法官道格拉斯宅中接見記者，申論彼在華倡導民衆識字遝動工作。晏博士指出中國三萬萬民衆，或中國全部人口四分之三，過去從未受任何正式敎育。</p>
<p>今後十年內　完全掃除文盲</p>
<p>彼稱迄今已有六千萬人受敎，已具閱讀能力；並稱吾人希望今後十年內可完全掃淸文盲。晏博士宣稱：本年一月間重慶政治協商會議通過之議案，對中國之敎育，經濟，與社會進展，將大有裨益。協商會之目的，爲引導中國走向民主大道。然若一般民衆窮困不堪，及缺乏閱讀能力，則民主政治焉有實現可能。吾人如欲人民在民主制度之下度合理之生活，則民衆敎育之主要目標，必須促其實現。晏博士談及彼於三月十一日，在白宮與杜魯門總統會晤經過時稱，總統對中國民衆敎育運動工作已略有所悉，唯彼願知詳細情形。</p>
<p>美專家來華　協助推行民敎</p>
<p>晏博士稱，彼於二年前啣中國政府之命，以戰後硏究委員會委員資格來美。最近彼方着手設法解決自美農業與醫藥專家獲取技術援助問題，此輩專家將遄赴中國，協助推行民衆敎育運動。雖具體辦法尚未確定，唯彼盼各專家則可成行。此一中國敎育家表示，希望中國能派送大批靑年赴美深造。晏博士謂尤以醫藥，公共衛生，及農業方面，美國有不少技術可以應用於中國，唯敎育方面則情形略有不同，因兩國之敎育問題廻異故也。晏博士表示彼個人預定一月內返華，以便繼續其推行識字運動工作。</p>

<h3>羅士培博士演講　中英科學合作</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕本月十四日下午四時，羅士培敎授在中英文化協會演講，略謂：「在中國，由於戰時之　困難環境，英文化協會開始工作時情形，至爲特殊·一九四二年，英國派遣牛津大學杜茲敎授，及聞名科學家倪德漢博士，至自由中國，與各大學以及專科學校取得聯絡。中國之困難環境，使中國科學家處於孤立地位。因之倪德漢博士憑過去在英美各國所得到之經騐，在中國設立一中英科學合作協會。開辦時，該協會之經濟，由英國文化協會供給，實則與英戰時生產部及若十英美科學社團，皆有所連繫。今戰時工作已告結束，但在文化協會之較廣大組織中，中英兩國仍當盡量秉互助互惠之精神，彼此交換文化·」</p>

<h3>快要遷滬的國立商學院</h3>
<p>— 方景蕘</p>
<p>在抗戰期中，內地有很多新興而著名的學府，國立商學院就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>主持這個學院的，是趙棣華，侯厚培，程瑞霖，張伯琴，武　幹等經濟名流。商學院的規模，相當宏大：大學部方面，分銀行，會計統計，工商管理，土地經濟四學系，現設於湖南乾城所里。分部方面的計政，合作兩專修科，則設在湖南沅陵。</p>
<p>有了四個學系的大學部都是四年制，計十六班，有了兩個專科的分部是二年制，計四班。總計男女學生共七百餘人，敎授近五十人，其中頗多學騐俱優的學者。</p>
<p>因爲抗戰期中物力財力缺乏的關係，商學院的校舍和設備，不免和其他大學一樣窳陋。但主持者那種堅苦支持及力謀擴充的精神，是值得佩服的。所以歷届畢業生成績頗優，多服務於內地政府機關及著名銀行。</p>
<p>現在抗議勝利，全國各大學紛紛準備復員，商學院自不能例外，巳請示敎育部尅期東遷。聽說本年度將届畢業的學生，當提前於本年四月中舉行畢業考試，五月問便開始遷校。校址大約在上海江　附近。京滬一帶校友，得到這個好消息，異常興奮，現正不約而同地在忙着籌備歡迎復校工作人員。我想這個國立商學院，如果能在這世界六大都市之一的上海，認眞地舉辦下去，一定能造就不少金融界出類拔萃的超特人才。</p>

<h3>隨馬帥視察散記（二）　延安神秘色彩　在和平的洪流中沖淡</h3>
<p>— 本報北平十一日航訊　特派員張劍梅寄</p>
<p>四號下午二點半，馬歇爾　將軍的C40銀色機，新聞記者，隊員們乘坐的綠蜻蜓一樣的C40巨型艇，匆匆告別了　　，向西南方一個完全不同的地方—延安飛去，從一方尺左右的窗子向外看，天空陰沉沉，C40又長又寬的鐵器貼著梅花圖似的濃云飛行，好像浪花洶湧的海波上漂浮著一條破船板。我本來希望從空中俯覽一下，去年今日漫遊的伊克昭盟沙漠的，而那片渺無邊際密不透縫的云層，卻隔斷了我的視綫，算了吧！我倒頭便睡，不曉得睡了多久，飛機艙裏喧鬧的人聲和風踏的腳步把我鬧醒，原來已經到達延安的上空了，每一個人都爲這極具有祕性的地方而興奮，憑窗外望，繼在飛機冀下的竟是一片鋸齒似的峯巒，這時飛機雖正在羣山間步步陡降，大家都瞪著眼睛疑惑著「怎麽下降啊？下麵都是山！」但是聰明穩健的飛行員，終於把我們帶到一塊隱蔽在羣山中間的巴掌大的小平　來，當四點半飛機的輪子輕輕的吻著大地時，大家異口同聲的「OK」。這一條去延安的路，它和中國的和平之路一樣，是：「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」！</p>
<p>彭德懷扶病到塲</p>
<p>今天我們的綠蜻蜓竟是趕了先。下機踏著冰雪初融後鬆軟的泥土，和一大堆從衣服上不能辨別身份的人忙亂的握手，其中有一位，身材高大，褐色的圓圓的臉，穿著一身深咖啡色粗糙毛呢的制服，戴鴨舌帽，活像都市工廠裏的一個工頭，握手後，交際處金延長趕到介紹一番，才知道他就是鼎鼎大名的毛澤東先生，這一天朱德，彭德懷，林祖涵，毛夫人江清（即藍蘋），朱夫人康無清，勞動英雄吳滿有等都到機塲歡迎，朱德將軍一身破舊的草綠粗呢軍服，黑羊皮領的灰棉大衣，如果在上海，一定會認爲一個「炊事兵」的，雖然是六十多歲的人了，仍然強壯得像一頭熊。彭德懷扶病到塲，他比廿九年　洛陽時顯得蒼老清瘳。林祖涵　人頭延安僅有的一部黑色小汽車來的，戴著一項怪大的藏青色呢質鴨舌帽。機塲四週高坡上擁護各色各樣的歡迎羣衆，撐著紅布標語，搖著紙旗，延安市街自衛隊還帶著惹人注目的紅櫻槍，來歡迎這位以原子彈作戰的同盟國參謀總長馬歇爾元帥。據說從正午起，延安各界三千多人組成歡迎行列即相繼進入機塲，已經等候四小時有半了。</p>
<p>吉普車入延水城</p>
<p>一刹那間，馬帥的C54銀色機也翩然降落。下機，握手，寒喧，攝影，這時全塲掌聲雷動，歡迎馬張周三將軍和「擁擠政協決議整軍方案」的口號此落彼起，馬帥檢閱了儀仗隊，坐上汽車穿過高懸中美國旗的彩門時，羣衆的歡呼聲把畫聲完全淹沒了，雖然羣衆中許多是穿著制服的，就是那些不穿制服的也不免是「奉命歡迎」，但是看見那些充滿希望和興奮的淳樸面孔，我仍相依其中大多數人是從心眼裏向和平的巨人馬歇爾歡呼的，沒有政治野心的人民，他們用「和平」是永遠沒有仇的。</p>
<p>美軍的吉普車從機塲氫我們送到延安南門外山坡上的交際處，在那裏呆了一下，我們一羣又出來逛大街。延安是一面傍山坡一面臨延安水的袖珍山城，廿七年敵機一塲轟炸，把全城炸光了，事隔八年，延安城還是一片敗屋頺垣只從城中間開闢一條冷冷清清土馬路，中旁邊殘留著兩棵大槐樹，此外便甚麽也沒有了。各機關審計署學校完全搬到了城外山坡或山谷崖壁上開驚的窟洞裏，這幾年軍政的中心差不多集中在城産，毛澤東住在茲將極遠的裘園，平常不大出來。中共中央辦公廳在城北延水對岸的楊家嶺，朱德住得離城最近的王家坪，馬歇爾元帥張治中將軍便下榻在的他的副長官部裏，較重要的機關在城南的只有陝甘邊區政府。城南大部是商業區，街道很窄，兩邊都是賣雜貨，布匹，的小鋪，新華書店和邊區銀行也嵌在這些商店中間，據招待我們的人說，這些商店原來都是小攤販，因爲這些年來生意頗能賺錢，紛紛蓋起房屋鋪面，不久便形成一條「街」了。爲著歡迎馬帥和張治中將軍，樸拙的延安被打扮起來了。牆上到處是紅紅綠綠的標語，歡迎張治中將軍的標語比較歡迎馬歇爾的不見得少，此外還有擁擠蔣主席的標語。每家商店機關都掛青天白日的國旗，看那國旗倒不像新做的——有些已經頗爲破舊了，但是平常不多掛也是可以想像的，因爲大多數的旗子都很飄揚，色彩很鮮。</p>
<p>延河的水又窄又淺，既不秀麗，也不雄壯，我們直不敢相信，那就是某些青年謳歌的延水嗎？「啊！你不曉得，夏天山洪暴發時，延水就大得怕人，每年都要冲壞好多荘稼　　，淹死好多人畜」，招待的人給我解釋，呌我不要輕看那條窄淺的小河。我站在延河灘上鵝卵石堆上，看那被敵機炸平的延安舊城廢墟，山坡崖壁上峰窩樣的原始窟洞，只産雜糧貧瘠的土地，一臉土氣的樸拙的人民，和那些智　學識並不是了不得的中共干部，不禁想起了一個問題，支配著相當廣大的地區的，就是這麽一個小城和它的干部嗎？這個小城的大權力的來源是什麽呢？這應當是一嚴肅的值得沉思的問題。</p>
<p>七點鍾的時候，我們坐大卡車，穿舊城，過延水到楊家嶺中共中央辦公廳，應毛澤東先生之宴，中央辦公廳是延安最漂亮的西式大廈，全部牆壁用水成岩的石頭砌成，有可容一百人跳舞的大會客廳和容納兩三千人開會的大禮堂，宴會七點半開始，會客廳裏足足開了十桌，菜餚是中式精美酒席。宴席上毛先生起立舉杯致詞：「馬歇爾將軍及張周兩將軍爲建立和平民主團結統一的新中國而奔渡辛勞，全國人民皆應感謝，中共亦致謝意。中國共産黨刻巳準備以一切努力於建國事業。中美合作萬歲！國共合作萬歲。謹祝杜魯門總統，蔣主席，馬歇爾將軍，張治中將軍，周恩來將軍及各位健康」！馬歇爾的答詞是簡短樸素熱情的：「我感謝毛主席的款待，請諸位爲中國人民乾杯」！</p>
<p>九點多的夜晚，延安各界的歡迎晚會在中央大會堂中開始，去年今日這裏曾經舉行過一次中共全國代表大會，至今會堂的前額還有赫然的一行紅字「有毛澤東的旗幟下勝利前進」。這一天朱德將軍的歡迎詞，頭尾都是首定的樂觀的，只有中間一段耐人玩味，那一段是：「不可否認的，中中國和平民主統一的事業上，還有許多障碍許多困難，這些障碍困難使停戰協定至今在有些地方還沒有實現。政協約決議所遇到的困難更多，因此預料整軍方案的實現，一定更不容易一帆風順」。馬歇爾在優美誠摯的演詞中也抛了一顆炸彈，那就是：「在重慶的政府中共雙方高級人員談判進行，一點也感覺到困難，現在困難的是在那些負有招待責任的年輕人身上，他們血氣方剛，這樣的反應雖是正常的，但是不久也應該成爲過去」，這些話是馬帥此次一萬多華里的旅行中感到的切膚之痛。張治中部長的講詞誠摯漂亮，他保證政府百分之百的實施三個協定，要求中國有二三十年的和平建設，最後他說，我還要講一個笑話，我剛才同毛主席毛夫人談過，將來你們共産黨寫歷史的時候，請不要忘記我張治中三到延安」！他的亦荘亦讀的演詞，曾經在台下掀起三次的掌聲，張氏詞畢開始遊藝節目；出乎意外的，毛澤東先生並沒有致詞，他一直坐在台下最前排馬歇爾的右側，保持緘默，於是會前晚宴席上毛氏舉杯祝福的幾名話，遂成了我們在延安十八小時（連睡覺的時間在內）所惟一聽到的毛氏公開發言的絕唱。</p>
<p>毛澤東到得最遲</p>
<p>次日馬帥別延安，送行的延安黨政軍要人中，毛澤東到得最遲，看起來他的臉色是胖胖的，但是精神氣色都不大好，久病初愈大慨是真的，在匆促之間記者問毛氏何時去重慶，「這次張部長來也談到這事」，毛說：「蔣主席甚麽時候要我去，我就可以去」。據說在頭天晚上，和那天早晨，毛氏曾和馬帥，張治中周恩來舉行談話，不過都是交換一下對於中國和國際問題的信念與認識，不會具體的討論什麽問題，官方人士透露，在談話中毛氏表示相當的好。馬帥臨登機時，和毛氏握手說：「我們的會晤，是有有歷史意義的」，這歷史性會見，在九時半C54銀色機馬達轉動冲上晴朗的天空時，使告一結束了。</p>
<p>離開延安以前，在機塲上，記者琿和失德將軍作過幾分鍾的談話，他再度表示中共堅決整軍方案，記者問執行整軍方案，有沒有甚麽困難，他說：「編餘官兵應當妥籌一個辦法」，林祖涵偶而談到，實行整軍方案，中下級軍官尚不免有疑慮心理，記者曾以此詢問朱將軍，他不承認這是事實。</p>
<p>林祖涵在延安是代表「政」的要人—他是陝甘寧邊區政府主席。記者問他陝甘寧邊區政府今後是否取消，他說陝甘寧邊區政府是行政院會議通過承認過的，將來是否取消，要看將來政府怎樣決定。</p>
<p>彭德懷在病中，（有人說是心臟病）在延安似乎不大露面，四日中央大會堂的歡迎晚會，他也力疾參加了，他默默的退隱在第三排的人叢中。會堂中沒有爐火，寒氣浸人，他一咳嗽，年輕溫婉的夫人浦安修女士（新民報記者浦熙修之妹，輔仁大學學生）便到前面椅子上把他脫掉的大衣取來。浦女士上身舊絨甲克，苗條美麗，像一隻小鳥。她說她一九三八年便到是邊了。</p>
<p>陳紹禹心胃俱病</p>
<p>一到交際處，我們記者便提出希望見的人的名單，這裏面有陳紹禹和野百合花的作者王實味，兩小時後，在中央辦公廳看到了陳紹禹，矮胖子，一身灰棉軍服，罩著皮領的灰大衣，花圍巾有點破舊了，質量關手杖，他說這些年在害心臟擴大，胃裏也有毛病，所以一直在休養，已經有五六年不到重慶了。（過去他曾是參政會上中共最活躍的人物。）聽說這些年他添了好幾個孩子。記者曾和他談到中蘇關係和東北問題，他的看法和新華日報社論完全一親，故不贅述。</p>
<p>徐特立一頭銀絲，老態龍腫，曾主湘政的張部長在毛澤東晚宴前，特別拉了這位湖南的老教育家談了一陣，我們問徐老預備回湖南不，他說「看情形吧」。</p>
<p>馬歇爾忍俊不禁　四日晚會後的遊藝，可以充份表現中共最近幾年是怎樣的捨棄了一些洋八股洋玩藝，而不惜屈身向農民學習民間藝術形式，以推行他們的政治教育。「歡迎馬歇爾將軍歌」是由兩對掛著腰鼓的農民裝束的男女，出來且舞且唱且敲鼓。其中的唱詞有「抗日戰爭得到勝利，各黨各派都有功勞」「國民黨與共産黨，是中國的兩隻膀」「國民政府蔣主席，全國人民都擁擠」「馬歇爾威名傳千古，和平史上永遠美名標」，聽了令人忍俊不禁，馬歇爾聽了　　後，也鼓掌大笑起來。另外還有「兄妹開荒」秧歌，是鼓勵增加生産的，俱說是邊區最成功的一個秧歌。雖然我們聽了嫌其簡單粗俗，（葉劍英大概也不感覺興趣，台上演著秧歌，他在台下呼呼的打起鼾聲了）但是這種覽勝舊形式的政治教育工作，的確是把落後的農村和共産黨聯繫在一起了。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　上海市牛奶同業響應學校牛奶運動</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>貴報在上月份的「專論」中刊戴倪章祺君著的論文，「極重要而被疏忽的一羣」，專論洞天福地沉重的營養問題，認爲現在社會上及學校當局舉行之獎學金，助學金及免費額等等，對於目今之洞天福地沉重能繼續求學上有重要的幫助，但假若這一羣沉重在受了社會上各方面的幫助能繼續其學業，而因其日常營養太差，長大後身體孱弱，甚至夭折，則不僅社會上歸於這一方面的工作，等於虛擲，誰能斷定內中不有未來的安通生，孫總理，巴斯達，達爾文等偉大天才，國營養不良而至夭折，對於我民族對於全人類是一個無可比擬的損失。沉重營養不良問題的重要，真似文內說：「譬如棄室於沙地，無堅固基礎，一這狂風聚雨，即雖支持，他們自己的鬥志，與各界對於他們的努力愛護與希望，均與彼積　之體同成泡影」。確切而沉痛，讀了誰會感動。</p>
<p>數天後，在一個同業偶然的集會中，有好幾位同業談起讀過這一篇文章，咸深表同情，對於「抗戰初期，物質低廉，每元可買雞蛋數十牧或牛乳數瓶，而其時沉重的飲食中，巳有缺少滋養品」之話，鑒於目前物價之飛漲，尤不勝感嘅系之。</p>
<p>本會是一個經營牛乳連業的結合，同時我們事業的性質，與國民伊朗及營養食物有深切的關係，在抗戰勝利後的建國工作中，我們如何應該發揮自己事業的特點，來肩負重大的任務，這是每一個事業料每一個國民所應有的自覺。因之，我們沒有忘記讀該文後所引的感嘅，與不安，使我們更認清了當前殘酷戰爭後的國民健康問題的嚴重，也加重了牛乳事業對社會應有的責任。</p>
<p>這一篇文章，給我們同業的影響並不中止盱同情，感嘅，與不安。在正式的會議上及同業間私人的談話中，我們巳好幾次談到牛乳業公會應以如何的行動來響應這一篇重要的文章，應該抱憾的是我們尚未討論出一個具體的計劃，在這個醒　中，我們高興於二月十日的貴報上又讀到陳萬里先生在「讀者意見」中所發表「利用過剩牛乳」的意見，陳先生以一位醫師的立塲，除同情況若的文章後，更積極地向社會及牛乳業公會提出實施的具體辦法，陳醫師提出辦法中，最主要的是社會上應仿照貸學金助學金的募集的方法，捐助出一筆款項，由社會上熱心人士組一委員會，管理此事，同時要求牛乳塲方面規定一僅夠成本的價格，供給牛奶，來免費的供給社會上一部份經過醫師檢查後發見營養不良，及其他有給與牛奶必須要的兒童，並規定先以洞天福地家庭裏出來的兒童辦起，由地方衛生及教育當局成立機構來負責派醫師檢驗小學兒童，作爲免費領飲牛奶之根據，並應嚴格地管理牛奶的衛生，合乎標凖，及利用廣播電影來展開這一保健運動。</p>
<p>讀了陳萬里先生的文章及其中列舉的辦法，我們真有與漸交併之感，假定這一社會上普遍的清寒沉重的營養問題，爲社會及有關市政當局所重視，陳君所提出之辦法，均屬切實可用，牛奶業全體同人當毫無遲疑地在這有關國民健康重要的運動中，貢獻出最真誠的合作。</p>
<p>新鮮牛乳是全世界被公認爲最合乎人類的理想營養飲料，在平時如此，在戰事更認爲重要，根據美國一九四四年的統計，共計乳牛二千門百萬頭，每日産量一二二，〇五七百萬磅，每人每日所飲之牛奶約一磅左右。在戰時英國，牛奶更認爲維持國民健康必需儀器，在戰前每人每日平均飲量爲半磅，兒童更逾此量，，全國的學校，幾全加入。（“Milk　in　Schools”Scheme）「學校中之牛奶政策」的運動，每兒童每日在正午必須領用牛奶增磅，付時值三分之一，其餘由政府津貼，如兒童家長無力付此，則由公家基金項下撥付之；在戰時，則政府規定，每一母親及五歲下之兒童每日可得半價之新鮮消毒牛奶一磅，在特殊情形下可免費供給之。戰時之牛乳既列爲國家戰時重要食物之一。平時之牛乳業亦在政府嚴加管理及愛護提倡之政策下，實因它與一國兒童發育，及成人的健康有着太密切的關係。</p>
<p>英美的人民每日平均的牛奶餘量在一磅左右，而在四五百萬人口的上海，日産牛奶三萬磅，在每一百多人才佔到一磅牛奶的比例下，還有牛奶略感過剩的現象（最近始有此情形，他並不甚多），這原因除了陳君國人相信廣播裏的補藥宣傳的原因之外，還有許多其他值得討論的因素，因有關方面多而複雜，希望能有機會在中文裏向社會作一牛乳業前途及其危機之商權。</p>
<p>本會寫這篇文字的意想是表示對倪陳二位先生文章熱烈的擁擠與響應，同時把我們的態度告訴社會，至其是否能從紙面的呼聲轉爲實際的行動，是否能成爲有助於清寒學童營養問題的事實，則有待於社會人士及有關當局之是否重視這一問題，及肯否登高提倡，本會富「靜候待命」。借這機會，我們還想向社會報告本會最近有意於試行「學校中之牛奶運動」。我們認爲健康是建國的根本，國民的健康運動的工作是任何工作的基點，國民健康運動的方法當然甚多，牛奶者及化該是完成這一目標的重要方法之一，在這一認識下，亦是在我們的本位上，這個實任及工作，我們應該勇敢地擔任起來，熱望社會有識之士，本市衛生教育當局，給我們寶貴的指示與協助。（上海牛乳業聯誼會函上，三月十日）</p>
<h3>張莘夫之死</h3>
<p>— 本報八日長春航訊　新人寄</p>
<p>撫順煤礦接收委員張莘夫，在撫遇害之消息，巳見本報，惟語焉未詳，現巳由遼寗省常務專員羅大愚，吉林省黨務專員呂文毓，長春市黨務專員王安文三氏，將張委員殉難始末，作成詳細報告。由此可知張委員之遇害經過，實爲一有計劃之陰謀，而撫順煤礦於張委員到撫之前，早經蘇方接辦，其爲蘇聯拒絕我政府之接收者明矣，而撫順之八路軍，不過爲其擺佈之傀儡而巳。</p>
<p>撫順煤礦接收委員張莘夫，於一月七日，率隨員六人，乘中長鐵路專車由長出發，蘇方有中長鐵路副理事長瑪利中將同行，瑪利各將態度溫和，稱言撫順煤礦係中國所有，定能順利接收。然車抵瀋陽後，瑪利突對接收事，隻字不提，且言撫順方面，非常危險，須被先往聯絡，阻止張委員前往。十日，東北行　　委員會主任委員張籌瑧來電話，催張委員連往接收，並言瑪利中將巳至撫順，曾告彼一切巳準備妥當，張委員因懼八路軍不敢前往。十四日張委員接</p>
<p>瑪利中將</p>
<p>通知，謂警方派遣軍官士兵，預備專車護送云撫，保證安全，出發時間爲正午一眯三十分。張委員遂率隨員徐毓吉，劉元春，牛俊章，張立德，程某等五名按時前往車站，瑪利中將並親召鐵路營護公安隊第二大隊長李遠民至車站，命派員隨行保護。遂由鐵路警護公安隊派遣第二大隊附張公謀，中隊長舒士卿，一等巡官白永剛，及鐵路警察六名，隨同去撫。張委員在站復與瑪利中將會見，瑪利言發展迅速與蘇聯駐撫司令官聯絡妥當，並派蘇軍士二十人保護前往。張委員即返其赴撫專車，因瑪利所派之兵長久不至，乃派人催促，但又言此隊兵或將不來，忽有二蘇軍來車，稱瑪利中將言在撫順車站有二十名蘇軍迎接，可不必顧慮，路上或不太平，切勿停車，請就此開車，車隊開駛。車開時車上人員除張委員及隨員共十五名外，車上司機火夫等十人共二十五人，時爲正午兩點十五分。</p>
<p>車行至瀋陽東四十里深井子時，（此處係八路軍佔領）車站有人擺紅旗命停，張委員牢記瑪利中將之言命勿停車，車站上即開槍射擊，張委員命加速駛過，不許還擊，而兩旁槍聲漸密，張委員等皆俯伏車上，幸未有人受傷，車下射擊約一百五十八發。車至將近撫順之大官屯站時，又擺扛旗使停，但仍未停。</p>
<p>全撫順站車停，站上</p>
<p>並無蘇軍</p>
<p>，張委員命人尋覓，乃如果有蘇軍二十人，但在大官屯，遂以電話通知使來，而駐軍撫順地區司令官與撫順市公安局副局長奉人到（即八路軍），該副局長即欲上前逮捕張委員等，但爲蘇軍司令官所止，並使張委員等入汽車，駛至撫順炭礦事務所。</p>
<p>抵達後，蘇司令官忽稱不知有接收之事。張委員解稱，「係東北行營經濟委員會主任委員張嘉敬派來，且巳與瑪利中將談妥，瑪利中將亦巳與貴軍聯絡妥當。」並問蘇軍司令官：「既云不知有接收煤礦事，爲何派員去車站迎接，」蘇軍司令官答：「因聞此車中有兩蘇聯軍官來撫，故往迎接，未聞你等來此。我們不知接收煤鑛之事，現在不能談。」乃送張委員等至撫順炭礦次長住宅。</p>
<p>十五日，有二蘇軍官引公安局長孫某及武裝公安隊進入，在樓下客廳內與張委員會談。孫言：「此地爲解放區，如無我們長官命令，無論何人不許侵入，你們帶來七名士兵，違反了我們的法律，應受處分，</p>
<p>處分方法</p>
<p>：第一是把這七名武裝士兵繳械，第二是請你們立即退出撫順。」張委員言係奉東北行營經濟委員主任委員張嘉敬之命令前來接收煤礦，武裝士兵亦係瑪利中將命路營派來護送。孫言：「我們的長官是省長張學思，張嘉敬他管不了。我們不管你們接收煤礦的事，只處分你們帶虎口侵入解放區的事。」張委員即加拒絕。牛俊章等見情形緊張，乃請張委員對孫等表示綏和，遂允明日交槍。稍後，，張委員同牛俊章赴撫順蘇軍司令部要求保護，並向　找瑪利中將通話，告以處境危險，請其設法，瑪利肯答明日早必到撫順。</p>
<p>是日午後，張委員由撫順與留派之隨員通話，告以：「因由派出發時未得瀋陽蘇軍司令官之正式許可，（指書面）故撫順蘇軍對彼等生命之保護，只能至遞話時爲止，雖經要求延長二十四小時，以便向上峯請命，然終未得該處之許可。」留瀋隨員即與瀋陽市長接洽，向蘇軍交涉營救，蘇軍態度曖昧，交涉毫無進展。</p>
<p>十六日晨，忽有公安隊數人持輪盤槍入內，將衆人拘於一室，言欲繳械，時屋外早巳武裝包圍。處此情況下，只得將槍械子彈卸下交與公安隊，繳械後，復至各處檢查。正當此時，張委員由外歸，見彼等檢查乃曰：「好吧，隨你們便吧！」公安隊在皮包中檢出</p>
<p>一包文件</p>
<p>翻看，張委員趨前，從其中抽出家信撕碎，公安隊乃大怒大罵，經勸解始息。</p>
<p>公安隊走後衆部張委員交涉如何，張委員僅言：「完了，瑪利沒來，到各處找，找誰也不給見了，往瀋陽打電話也找不到瑪利。」狀甚焦急。</p>
<p>正午四點鍾，撫順蘇軍司令官忽率蘇軍士及公安隊數人來言：「送你們回瀋陽。」張委員等即問：「日巳將暮，走路有無不便？」蘇軍司令官答：「沒關係。」張委員使彼負責，蘇軍司令官笑言：「這何必呢？你們都是中國人，還有什麽關係嗎？」時張委員神經巳受極大刺激，手巳發顫。至將出門時，蘇軍司令官忽言：「只許技術人員走，七名武裝者不許走。」張委員因一等巡官白永剛不在武裝士兵之內，乃張委員所特殊約來，乃向蘇軍司令要求：「白非普通士兵，係特殊人員，應與接收人員同樣看待。」乃拉白出，但又爲蘇軍司令官拉回，張委員乃言：「明日蘇軍如不放你們回瀋陽，後日必親來撫接你們。」乃分乘四輛小汽車赴車站而去。</p>
<p>瀋陽方面，十六日晚曾以電話詢問撫順車站，答稱張委員等巳於午後八點三十分左右，乘蘇軍軍用列車返瀋，彼親在車站目睹張委員等所乘之車出發。</p>
<p>三十日得撫順人民自南團體及居民之報告言：張委員</p>
<p>到撫次日</p>
<p>有名王新三者，在撫順公安局保護下，已經接收煤礦。而王新三乃爲撫順煤礦之副礦長，其正礦長係俄人，因中央接收消息早巳公佈報端，故一般市民均認爲王新三者即爲中央任命之接收委員。</p>
<p>二十五日，瀋陽市警察局獲利報告稱：張委員等八名於十六日晚，被撫順蘇軍以軍用列車運至市外二十里地點，用刺刀殺戮！</p>
<p>二十六日，撫順人民自衛團體代表榮海瞻報告經過如下：</p>
<p>二月十六日午後八點二十分左右，蘇軍以軍用列車載張委員及隨員徐毓古，劉元春，程某，翻譯張立德及鐵路警護公安隊大隊附　公謀，中隊長舒士金卿等，且有蘇軍軍官兵士及撫順公安局等多人登車向瀋陽出發，午後九點鍾左右，抵撫順西第五站李石寨車站，蘇軍強令下車，將張委員等衣服剝下，帶至該站南山亂屍崗子以刀刺死。當時張委員以悲憤言詞說：「餘自九一八事變後即脫身關內，不想於歸田故里之際，竟得如此結果。餘爲國家民族，甘願領此厚遇！」第二大隊附荘公謀赤身與公安隊搏鬥，且曾搶下一到槍，但卒被刺倒，後檢其屍體曾受刀傷十六處。當時附近居民皆聞呼號哀呼，</p>
<p>慘不忍聞</p>
<p>留在撫順炭鑡次長住宅之白永剛及六名鐵路警察，自問必死。而前兩日在外守衛之一蘇軍忽來，謂：「現在要殺你，你快跑吧！已經把他們殺了。」白未深信，亦未隨去，但心更驚慌。十一點鍾，忽公安局事局長率若干隊來槍口對凖白等，押至公安局，由公安隊看守，直到夜半，副局長同公安隊七八人又進來，向白等道歉，使問撫順炭礦次長住宅。</p>
<p>十七日，看守白等之一年四十餘之張姓男子，對白等言：「你們危險期巳過，現巳無生命危險。以後或者送回瀋陽，或者送往礦山，或者加入八路軍之訓練。」</p>
<p>十八日，天雨明，即來二蘇軍，對白等言：「送你們到車站去。」白等未知此行禍福，臉色聚變，蘇軍笑言：「你們害怕嗎？是不是你們有兩個警察被殺了？」白等聞言，以張委員等或巳遇害，更增恐怖。而蘇軍竟將白等送到瀋陽，到大廣塲之蘇軍　成司令部後，有二蘇軍官審問白等是否爲國民黨，出示撫順蘇軍送來之公文，上寫：「十五名團民黨來撫順擾亂礦山，巳打死八名，捕獲七名。」白等辯白乃鐵路警察，係受瑪利中將之命到撫順守護鑛山者，始得送至瀋陽市警察局，而獲釋放。</p>

<h3>從喜劇看莫里哀和莎士比亞</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>十六世紀末葉到十八世紀前牛期，「喜劇」這種戲劇形式，有很顯著的發展，在當時的藝術似域中占有極重要的地位。這是因爲受了意大利文藝復典的影響，古希臘和羅馬的喜劇又重新活在當時作家們的心裏了。</p>
<p>代表那個時代的喜劇作家是莫里哀和莎士比亞。而他們二人的作品，又表現出兩個相反的趨向。誰都知道莫里哀在當時，是法國喜劇中成就最高的，他的劇本在法國文壇上永遠有磨滅不了的光輝。莎士此亞更是名垂千古的劇作家，差不多婦孺皆知。莫里哀的一貫作風是表現現實社會的情况，充分地流露着古典主義的精神和色彩，他的喜劇的題材，完全得自當時的實際社會情形。對於人物的描寫，比較忽略特殊的個性，而側重在比較一般的典型，這點恰恰與莎士比亞相反，他重視故事的效果甚於性格的效果。所以在個別的性格的描摩上莎士比亞是很看重的，而莫里哀則着眼於典型的性格的表現。</p>
<p>莫里哀的喜劇中的人物，都是當時的現實社會裏的人物，他的作品反映了當時社會生活的全面。有人說從他的作品中可以讀到十七八世紀的社會史。「喜劇之社會功能」被他發揮無遺。他在他的作品中顯示給人們的是人們相互的敵對和必然的衝突。雖然他以他鋒利的文筆暴露常時社會的黑暗面，實際上他倒是說明了人與社會之間的關係以及人與人之問的關係。他企國他的觀衆看了他的戲能够對社會有淸晰的了解，能够由此而引起改造社會的思想。他不像莎士比亞愛用美　的收塲，配合音樂的效果以娛觀衆，他只想能使觀衆引起一種含有思想成分的笑就夠了。</p>
<p>這樣不妨看看他自已對於喜劇的說明：「描摩在舞臺上的一切可笑的圖形，應使每個人看了都不覺得不安。那些圖形都是公共的鏡子，在那裏面，我們要不佯爲看見我們自己。」「實在的</p>
<p>發揮偉大的情思，控告命運，　備神明，都比在一個適當的方式中洩露出嘲笑，或使人類的過　在舞臺上顯得愉快，容易得多。當你描寫那些英雄時，你能隨你高興地作去，那都是些幻想的形象，在那上面我們並不要求一種類似。」從這些話我們不難看出他的思想。</p>
<p>在莫里哀的戲劇中，我們很少者到熾盛的熟情和豐富的想像，這又是和莎士比亞完全不同的。莫里哀處理劇情常用理智的成分多於情感的成分，有時甚至丟開情感，而只作一般實際常識的說明。樓實，客觀，冷靜，沈着是他作品的特點，他是訴諸他的理性和中庸思想而產生他的作品，所以極端和誇張很少。不像莎士比亞的喜劇是由熱情交織起來的，而是把人類的弱點和過錯，通過典型性格的表現，理智地提供出來，自然這裏面只找到個別的敵對觀念，看不着緊張活躍的場面。</p>
<p>莫里哀的每一齣喜劇，都是一般的社會現實的表現，對於人物的刻劃，特別强調一般的社會眞理，絕不像莎士比亞那樣注重特殊的性格的創造。他給予人們的是一些社會典型，絲毫看不出個性。個人對於社會的反抗，在莎士比亞的喜劇中是很同情於個人的，他是站在被社會壓迫的地位而處理劇中人物，目的在喚醒人們改造不合理的社會。莫里哀的作品，雖然表現個人和社會間的衝突，但他部絕不同情於那般反抗社會的個人，他不贊成人們去改造旣成的社會勢力，人應遷就社會。像他在他的「恨世者」一劇中，愛瑟司脫所以成爲可笑的人就因他妄想改造社會，他覺得當時的社會太虛僞，加以很重的攻擊。在莫里哀看來，愛瑟司脫這人實在可笑，因爲社會畢竟沒有錯，沒有可以指謫的餘地，錯的却是愛瑟司脫本人。</p>
<p>一般地說，莫里哀的喜劇，有他不朽的藝術價値，與其說牠是文學的，也可以說牠是哲學的。就「訴諸理性」一點而論，他和羅馬那種建立在情勢或巧計上的喜劇，英國的蔣森所代表的那權諷刺的或現實的喜劇，屬於同一類，而莎士比亞的「訴諸情感」的喜劇以及十八十九世紀的那種傷感的喜劇，顯然地又是另一類了。</p>
<h3>要寫得純粹</h3>
<p>— 衛聰</p>
<p>近來很多作家都主張文章要寫得純粹，像艾蕪，斬以，端木　良，蘆焚諸人都曾發表過文章的形式表現上的意見，而論斷都不的而　的是：優美的文章，一定是優美的口語的紀錄。</p>
<p>自從五四運動以後，白話文在社會上盛行，到現在近三十年了。白話文的成功，對我國文化和敎育的貢獻，誰都不能否認，無論從普及敎育或推進文化的那一點來說，白話文確有其不可磨滅的價值</p>
<p>然而語體文在文學革命上就算成功了嗎？不，我們不能說牠已經究全成功，只能說牠一部分成功。誠如已故作家張天翼說：「在說體文沒有能完全接近純粹的口語以前，牠不能算是完全成功。」顧名思義，所謂語體文一定是指用口語的表現方法寫下來的文章，而語文統一已爲世界各國的共用趨勢。語言是表達思想的，文章同樣是表達思想的，牠們各有各的用途，然而目的却是一樣的。</p>
<p>有許多文章寫得文不文，白不白，夾維得很，給予讀者的反應是不協調，不乾凈，讀了多不爽快。朱自淸曾在一篇論作法的文章中亟力主張：不寫語體文則罷，否則一定要寫得像口語，不上口的詞和字，都該摒棄於文章以外。劉半農也是已指出寫作的一條大路：要好好地訓練口語，才能寫出好文章來。</p>
<p>這裏我且引用葉聖陶的一段話：「文言敎養受得很淺的，或者簡直不曾受過文言敎養的，那是幸福的人，他們不必費什麽心思力氣，讓自己從舊鐐銬裏解放出來。很敎人擔心的是他們去檢起一副舊鐐銬來，套在自己的手脚上——他們在語體文裹也來一點文言的詞句。」葉氏的這幾句話說得很透澈，他是亟力主張作者要把握「要寫得純粹」的這原則的。是的，語體文再要向文言文討救兵，實在有些說不過去。</p>
<p>現在寫文章的人，多數都受過很深的文言文敎養。他們在寫語體文時，會無意地插進一些文言的成文套語，所以要想完全避免不用一點文言的詞句，有時竟做不到，就是那些主張文章要寫得純粹的作家，他們的散文和小說，縱竭盡其心力，也還不能不用文言的詞句，也還不能不破壞語體文的純粹。比較成功的要算是朱自清和葉聖陶，他們寫的文章已經接近口語了，雖然不能說完全接近。純粹的語體文實在並不容易寫，對於寫作技巧一定要經過一番訓練，要寫得流暢，乾凈，簡潔，生動。</p>
<p>有人說，文草寫得接近口語，那不是「俗而傷念」嗎？這是極不正確的傳統的看法。要知道一篇好的文章一定要有豐厚的情感或獨到的思想，單單在形式上用幾點自認爲很典念的文言詞句，加以渲染，那怎能說得上「念」？思想是現實生活的反映，而請言和文章又同爲表現思想所不能缺少的工具，能把眞實的思想表現出來，即使把再怎樣俗俚的語言寫出來，也次不會失其價値的。古人尚且知道說：「至情無文」可見最能感動人的文章並不出之陳言套語的推敲，綺語塵詞的裝點。</p>
<p>許多人都說朱自淸的「背影」是一篇好文章，速作者自己也承認那篇短短的散文是他作品巾比較滿意的一篇。那篇文章發表了二十多年了，然而一直有人愛讀牠，幾乎每種初中國文裏都選入。「背影」之所以令人愛讀，實在是由於作者有豐富的感情，有親歷的經騐，不是無病呻吟硬寫出來的。加以他能純粹的口語的手法表現他的觀感，所以雖無所謂典念之詞，綺麗之言，單憑口語的詞句，仍足打動人的心弦。像這樣的文章，中學生甚至小學生都讀得懂，然而大學生並不見得就能寫得出，怕連完全欣賞到牠的好處都不能吧？</p>
<p>抗戰期間傳誦一時的一差半車麥稭」是用最通俗的口語寫出來的短篇小說，牠所以能獲得很高的評價，就因爲有內容，並且能用純粹的口語體表現出活現現的人，活現現的社會。老舍的小說也很爲人愛讚，有人說他的成功便在能用純拌的口語體刻劃出他的典型人物。</p>
<p>高爾斯華綏說：「寫作的秘訣很簡單。初學寫作的人要多聽戲，注意台詞的表白，仔細地讀劇本的對話，可以帮助寫作。」我們要希望我們寫出的文章，小之數百字的小品，大之數百萬言的小說，我們要問一下：這是不是純粹的口語？此外，我們又得好好地生活，有充實的生活（要在社會人羣裏過有意義的生活，並隨時隨地檢討自己的生活，改進自己的生活。再把正確進步的思想發展起來，都能帮助寫作。至於如何據充語　，使我們的語嘗和文章能够更表現得更完美更充實，那尤其是不容忽視的。</p>
<h3>沁園春</h3>
<p>— 許君武</p>
<p>題與魯莽合影</p>
<p>八載渝州，同醉東風，共寫史詩。念滿目胡塵，腥氛應掃；賞心樂事，盛會難追。風雨鳴雞，笑君與我，報國文章筆幾枝。閒來道，要江南塞北，再攬芳菲。　重逢海上眞奇！誰信是澄淸天宇時？且收拾沈哀，並肩携手，安排來日，吐氣揚眉。塵土功名，寳珠才調，春夢留痕或有之。揮毫處，看雄姿英發，不負襟期。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（二十）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>如果說石玉樓也愛翁二太太，倒不如說石玉褸需要翁二太太的恰當。幸而翁二太太手裏還有些私藏的首飾，她便常常買烟土，買補品，供養石玉樓。所以石玉褸覺得生活方面少不了翁二太太，至於感情，他自己也茫然得很，他彷彿感情都發揮在「戲」上了！他已經不大意識得出人生與戲有什麽區別。有時他甚而以爲戲是他的生命之全部，他是爲戲而活着，爲了戲，他才吸烟，正如爲了戲，他才需要翁二太太是一樣。他說不淸這情緒，因此他也無從把這種情緒告訴翁二太太。儘管他明白翁二太太的心和他不同，他明白翁二太太就是把他當作了生命之全部，但他以不爲然，他暗暗笑翁二太太是一個愚蠢的人！翁二太太是附屬於他的副生命部分的·</p>
<p>爲什麽石玉樓會這些樣？因爲他是一個機械化了的伶入，他沒有「戲」以外的知識，他雖然唱出那麽多詞句，詩文，可是他並不認識一個字。他唱的詞句，詩文，都是由師傳口授的，他僅能一識半解這些詞句，詩文，而不知道這些詞句，詩文是從書裏來的。所以，他沒法從戲裏跳到現實，也正因爲如此，他不會感受眞幸福；其快樂；也不會感受眞痛苦；眞憂慮！</p>
<p>石玉樓不失爲一個心地良善的人，當他意識到翁二太太在他的身上有了企圖，而他自己在翁二太太的身上却無企圖，於是受找了個機會，破例地打開了經他銜默的嘴，很鄭重地向翁一太太說：</p>
<p>「你知道，我是一個戲子！一個跑碼頭的戲子！我隨時都會離開這兒，也就是離開你！」</p>
<p>翁二太太毫不驚異地點點頭說：</p>
<p>「我知道！可我一點兒也不在意。」</p>
<p>「那就好！」石玉樓很快活地又微笑了·</p>
<p>石王樓絕沒有想到翁二太太是這樣一種乾脆利落的回答，這簡直是不大合乎石玉樓對於翁二太太一般理解的邏輯！他雖然很快活，可又有些奇怪起來，他不能相信翁二太太這句話是出於眞誠的，他根據翁二太太以往的情態，翁二太太不會講出這句話來·由於這句話，他覺得翁二太太也不過是把他同樣看作是：她的副生命部分之附屬品罷了！於是石玉樓感到了侮辱！也許是一種隱隱的惆悵吧？石玉樓後悔曾經發生這麽一段多餘的人事關係。</p>
<p>翁二太太看着石玉樓那種沉思默想，若痴若呆的神氣，不禁好笑起來。她自然不會瞭解石玉樓這時的心情，而且她相常的誤會了石玉樓，她以爲石玉樓在試探她，甚而在憂慮着將來——石玉樓捨不得離開她。因此，她悄悄欣慰！她感到無上的幸福與驕傲，她相信石玉樓已經被她所控制，石玉樓是在深深地愛着她！</p>
<p>『喂，你道個吃「開口飯」的，怎麼又關上你的金口了呢？』翁二太太打趣地說。</p>
<p>石玉樓茫然地瞟了一眼公二太太，他不知道翁二太太這話是什麼意思？他應當怎樣回答她才好！繼而，他從翁二太太那種恬怡愉快的神氣，感到了惡意的愚弄，於是，他簡直惱了！他想想原來她比我聰明，她和一切捧我的男男女女的心是一樣，我是唱戲的；她是看戲的；我是她偶然消遣的一個對象，我走了照樣還有別的戲子再來供她解悶；所以，我離開她，她並「不在意」。我，不過是她心目中的玩偶罷了！是的，看戲的人聰明，只有唱戲的人才愚蠢！」想到這裏，石玉樓憤慨得滿而緋紅，毅然揮袖欲去。</p>
<h3>我們那一伙人</h3>
<p>— 宋牧</p>
<p>他告訴我一些別後的事情，雖然我們分關也不過才五六年光景，但人物的變化却呌人起着濃厚滄桑之感，我們互相欷獻了一陣，我說我好像聽一個迷離的故事，又好像做一個悠久的夢，他祇淡漠地回答，「因爲我們都老了」。</p>
<p>我好像沉浸到過去的回憶裏，我的腦筋裏浮着一連串影子，那時我們在山城求學，日子充滿活潑愉快·我們辦劇團，辦壁報……我們都天眞，單純，幹着自已認爲神聖的事業，沒有憂愁，沒有煩惱，誰會想到，那伙人到現在都已星物分散，他說起那個有一張很漂亮臉盤的長個子這幾年混得很不得意，一度投過軍，不斷爲粉紅色的戀情苦痛着，現在還在一個偏僻的角落裏流浪着，還有那個身材魁梧的東北人，我很容易記起他，我離開安南的時候，他還曾看過我一趟，他的粗糙的臉皮上綴滿一粒粒疙瘩，他很容易動怒，兩隻眼睛睜得滾滾圓，一似要同別人打架的樣子，他笑得很難看，那會他爲了一個女孩子同另一個朋友鬧得很撇扭，我們分別後，據說他頗走紅一時，現在他當了一家保險公司的副經理，已經娶了個太太，聽他說，這個當年暴燥的漢子變得很馴和，他安安份份幹着自己的行業，他從前追求的那個女孩子也嫁了人，一切都好像很美滿。</p>
<p>我的朋友瞧着我低着頭悶悶着，於是不耐地提醒我：</p>
<p>「你記起那個臉皮白白的上海人嗎？我們當時祇呌他小滑頭的？」</p>
<p>「你是說那個頭髮成天梳得光油油的？」</p>
<p>「嗯，就說的是他，他現在在昆明擺地攤呢？」</p>
<p>我微微怔忡了一下，我是很難置信的。</p>
<p>「他不是很能幹？」</p>
<p>「也許罷，離開學校以後，他起初開一爿牛肉店，隨後聽說私生活很糟，就淪成這步田地呢。」</p>
<p>隨後他像忽然想起了什麽，拍着我的肩膀：</p>
<p>「喂，你要我告訴你一點關於那個大眼睛姑娘的消息嗎？」</p>
<p>「你是說？…」</p>
<p>「你忘記了？我說的是那個住在街子上的，往日我們時常愛下鄉的那地方？」他停了一停，深長地凝視了我一下又接着說：「人家後來還常想你呢？悔呀，你也就不捎個信？」</p>
<p>「她現在呢？」</p>
<p>「早就嫁人啦，還有好幾個小孩呢。」</p>
<p>我沉默了半響，我的朋友又加說着。</p>
<p>「聽說她目前境遇不很好呢，她過得很不痛快。」</p>
<p>也許我的朋友有意將話題轉到別方面，他問我還記得當初我們住屋前栽着的茶花不，他說因爲不攤着花季，否則他很想給我帶下一兩枝的，對於朋友的好意，我感激地笑了。</p>
<h3>社會服務　讀者來函懇切表示　職業青年從事義敎</h3>
<p>希望在泰山區租得適當校舍</p>
<p>編者先生：我們都是職業靑年，有工作的熱誠，極想利用業餘的時間，做一點有益社會國家的工作，我們想在泰山區辦一所義務夜校，搶救一部份失學的成年人。因爲他們是建設新中國的中堅份子，所以他們應該有受敎育的機會。可是我們對於敎育界方面很生疏，現在雖然有肯盡義務的敎員，有肯在物質方面援助我們的親友，更相信將來也一定會有孜孜響學的學生，就是沒有上課的地方。看到目前晚上各校課室空着的很多，我們每天只需要借用兩小時，而且準備出相當合理的租金，可是我們就沒有辦法借到，我們在期待着，希望熱心敎育的學校當局，向我們伸出援助的手來，借敎室給我們，帮助我們把這所成人義校建立起來，鼓勵並督促我們的辦事勇氣，素仰貴報熱心公益，敢請披露為幸。（讀者：蔡澤）</p>
<p>編者按：蔡君等熱心義敎，不勝欽佩，甚望泰山區一帶學校當局，惠予贊助；好在他們願納合理的租金，這一椿服務社會的義舉，我想讀者之中，一定會見義勇為的，請來信轉洽。</p>

<h3>Second Plenary Session Enters Discussion Phase; Northeast Report Submitted for Review; Election Methods for Central Standing Committee Determined</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The Second Plenary Session continued its 16th meeting at 3 PM on the 14th. Chairman Ju Zheng presided, continuing the review of the Northeast problem report. Committee members including Fu Rulin, Wang Xingzhou, Huang Yuren, Qi Shiying, Xu Xiaoyan, and others submitted written opinions, reviewing issues such as delays by personnel responsible for the takeover and inappropriate diplomatic handling. Subsequently, the Secretariat reported the list of members for the Northeast Problem Report Review Committee, convened by Zhu Qing, Gu Weijun, and Xiao Tongzi. Following this, Committee member Lu Zhonglin reported on his inspection of North China, conveying the hopes of the North Chinese people to the Central Government. Currently, the people of North China are in dire straits, eagerly awaiting rescue. After his report, the entire assembly applauded. The presidium then reported on the preliminary discussions of over forty committee members, including Li Si Cong. Minister Zhang Zhizhong reported on the cessation of military conflict and inspection of transportation restoration, stating that twenty-five cities were still surrounded by Communist troops, with the people suffering greatly. He suggested that the Military Mediation Executive Department order the Communist troops to immediately lift the siege and withdraw beyond sixty li to demonstrate sincerity in supporting the Political Consultative Conference. The presidium decided to forward this to the National Government to transmit to the Mediation Department. The chairman then announced a recess. At this point, the reporting and review of items were completed, and the session entered the discussion phase. After the recess, the chairman announced the start of proposal discussions. The presidium first reported on (1) research opinions regarding the election methods for the Central Standing Committee and (2) the review report of the Food Problem Report Review Committee. Li Jingzhai, Lu Dangping, Zhang Jiuru, Wu Shaoshu, Wu Guozhen, Gu Zhenggang, Liang Hancao, Liu Jianqun, Li Zhongxiang, and others spoke, leading to lively discussions. The session was then unanimously approved by applause. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. Tomorrow's meetings, both morning and afternoon, will continue to discuss proposals. Whether the session can conclude on the 15th as scheduled is currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] During the 16th session of the Second Plenary Session, a presidium report was passed. The provisional motion by Committee Member Zhang Ji and sixty others regarding the Central Standing Committee and election methods was thoroughly researched and drafted by the presidium, and resolved as follows: (1) The number of Standing Committee members is set at thirty-six. (2) The election of Standing Committee members will use an anonymous, limited speed-voting method, with two-thirds of the votes required for election, and those with the most votes will be elected. (3) The methods for electing Standing Committee members at future plenary sessions will be determined separately.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The 16th session of the Second Plenary Session was held this morning at 9:25 AM, chaired by Bai Chongxi. 253 committee members were present. Firstly, Liu Fei, Vice Minister of the Military Affairs Department, reported on the military takeover of the Northeast. Liu provided a detailed report on the military takeover situation in the Northeast from the Japanese surrender to the present, the number of National Army troops currently in the Northeast, and the details of negotiations between our side and the Soviet side.

<h3>Liu Fei and Zhang Jia'ao Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Today marks the fourteenth day of the Second Plenary Session. The 16th meeting in the morning focused on reports regarding the Northeast issue. The meeting commenced at 9:20 AM with 258 committee members present, including Yu Youren, Song Ziwen, Wu Zhongxin, and Gu Weijun. Committee member Bai Chongxi chaired the meeting. Following the reading of the 15th session's minutes and report documents, the chairman announced the Northeast problem report. Firstly, Liu Fei, Vice Minister of the Military Affairs Department, reported on the military situation in the Northeast. Liu described (1) the military situation in the Northeast from the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan on August 9th to Japan's surrender on August 14th; (2) our side's agreement with the Soviet side on the date and procedure for the Soviet troops' withdrawal, based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (3) the advance of our troops sent to the Northeast for the takeover; (4) the actual situation of our troops' defense takeover; (5) after Japan's surrender, the Chinese Communist troops began to enter the Northeast, increasing their strength and expanding their territory under the guise of "opposing civil war," and the reality of this situation; (6) the current situation of the Chinese Communist troops' disruptive activities in various parts of the Northeast. During Liu's report, he was clearly reserved due to various difficulties, and the assembly frequently responded with encouraging applause. Subsequently, Zhang Jia'ao reported on the lack of results in negotiations with the Soviet side in Changchun regarding the takeover of industries and mines, and the reasons for this. He stated that, based on his observations over the past few months, he believes that the future of the Northeast requires starting with improving politics, developing light industry, and popularizing education. After a recess, the review of the Northeast problem began, with speeches by Committee Members Zhu Qing and Mei Gongren. Finally, Committee Member Chen Cheng reported on the meeting between Committee Member Chen Lifu and representatives of seven Northeast groups, relaying the opinions of the representatives. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Zhang Jia'ao reported at the Second Plenary Session today that the National Government notified the United States and Britain in September of last year that Japanese industrial property in the Northeast should belong entirely to China. In November, when he arrived in the Northeast, a Soviet representative told him that the Soviet Union's losses in the war were at least as significant as the combined losses of the Allied nations, so the Soviet Union should receive war spoils in the Northeast. He immediately returned to Chongqing to report to Chairman Chiang, and then returned to Changchun with Chiang Ching-kuo to consult with Soviet representatives, explaining that the war spoils issue should be resolved by the Sino-American-British-Soviet Japanese Control Committee. The Soviet side should facilitate the entry of Chinese troops into Shenyang and other places so that the National Army can first secure public order while awaiting the arrival of the main forces. Shortly after, he returned to Chongqing again, and on December 24th, he received instructions from Chairman Chiang: (1) It should not be acknowledged that the Soviet side regards Japanese industries as war spoils; (2) Sino-Soviet economic cooperation should not be discussed before the withdrawal of Soviet troops. On January 5th, he formally met with Marshal Malinovsky in Changchun. Malinovsky's demands were greatly reduced compared to before, requesting joint Sino-Soviet management of 9 out of 22 mineral deposits in the Northeast, 9 out of 54 power plants, and 6 out of 8 machinery factories, but no economic cooperation agreement has been established with the Soviet side to date. After Japan's surrender, Northeast industry suffered significant damage, with an estimated 16% of coal mines, 50% of steel factories, 70% of machine factories, and 50% of textile factories destroyed. Food losses also amounted to 25%, while power plants suffered only 0.7% damage. The government had hoped that Soviet troops would secure the public order of cities such as Shenyang while awaiting the arrival of National Army troops for the takeover.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Uses Gu Weijun as a Reference; Approves Increasing Police Pay</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Chairman Chiang received Gu Weijun, the ambassador to the UK, last night, inquiring about the progress of the United Nations. Gu recently returned to the capital to report to the government and participate in the Second Plenary Session. Furthermore, the chairman has approved a five-year plan to reform the police, increasing police pay, improving equipment, and enhancing training.</p>
<h3>Marshal Marshall Flies to Honolulu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 13th, Associated Press] Marshal Marshall flew here for a brief stopover. He told reporters that he has prepared a report on the recent situation in China and the Northeast, which he will submit to the White House after returning to the United States.</p>
<h3>It is Reported that Fu Zuoyi's Participation Received a Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Committee member Fu Zuoyi attended the Second Plenary Session for the first time on the 14th. When Fu entered the hall, committee members rushed to shake his hand, expressing fervent congratulations to this long-victorious general who defended the country and its territory. When Committee Member Lu Zhonglin reported on his inspection of North China, he paid particular respect to Fu, earning enthusiastic applause from the assembly. A reporter specifically approached Fu, who said that the people of Baotou and Guihua after the lifting of the siege were extremely impoverished, and the provincial government had organized emergency relief, but the efforts were only a drop in the bucket, and relief work still urgently needed to be promoted. Currently, four of the twenty-one counties in Suiyuan are occupied by Communist troops.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold and Foreign Currency Prices Stable</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] Today, gold factory bars reached a maximum of 154,800 yuan per tael, closing at 153,800 yuan. Cast bars closed at 151,500 yuan. US dollars reached a maximum of 2090 yuan, closing at 2035 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Counterfeit Central Reserve Bank Notes Extended to the End of May</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The Ministry of Finance's exchange of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes was previously scheduled to end at the end of March this year. As the deadline is approaching, it has recently been reported that the Ministry, in consideration of the people's interests, has decided to extend the exchange period by two months, until May 31st of this year.</p>
<h3>Passengers Treated as Cargo; China National Aviation Corporation Violates Regulations; Yu Feipeng Claims to Have Ordered Correction</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) charges passengers as cargo in violation of regulations, at a rate of over 9,000 yuan per kilogram. If each person weighs 50 kilograms, then a fee of over 400,000 yuan is required. The charter flight method is also more expensive than passenger fares. During the Second Plenary Session, Pan Gongzhan questioned Minister Yu Feipeng of the Ministry of Communications about this matter. Minister Yu replied that after receiving the report, the Ministry had ordered the person in charge of the company to earnestly correct the situation. The carrying of passengers on cargo planes should be calculated according to passenger rates and should not be charged as cargo. The company's transportation of passengers from Kunming to Shanghai and Guangdong is approved by the air inspection office, and tickets are sold in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee; Hasty Completion of Handover Procedures</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] It is rumored that the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee will be reorganized immediately, and the position of Chairman will be concurrently held by Vice Mayor Ma Yuanfang. It is rumored that the Municipal Party Committee is currently handling handover procedures.</p>

(3) Regarding the constitutional draft, issues such as the central political system and provincial constitutions of the National Assembly were discussed, and the opinions of all parties gradually converged.</p>
<h3>Various Northeast Groups in Chongqing Petition the Second Plenary Session, Presenting Seven Demands</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The Chongqing Northeast Native Place Association, the Northeast Three Provinces Reconstruction Promotion Association, the Northeast Construction Society, the Northeast Refugee Relief Committee, and the Northeast Righteous People Returning Home Relief Committee, among other groups, believe that the Northeast problem is becoming increasingly serious, and our government's true effectiveness in the takeover remains a mystery, causing extreme anxiety. They originally planned to petition the Second Plenary Session yesterday, but the meeting was adjourned. Therefore, they changed the plan to depart from the Heilongjiang Reconstruction Promotion Association at 9 AM this morning to petition the Second Plenary Session, specifically presenting seven requests, requesting the plenary session to formulate them into proposals and submit them to the government for implementation: (1) Request the government to notify the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and withdraw its troops immediately; otherwise, it should formally declare that the Soviet Union has violated the alliance treaty. (2) The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is the maximum extent of China's concessions. In addition to the treaty, please request the government to reject all Soviet demands that harm rights and interests. (3) Request the government to disclose Sino-Soviet diplomatic negotiations and stop on-the-spot negotiations. (4) Request the government to take strong measures and send more troops to take over the Northeast by force. (5) The illegal regime and armed troops established by the Chinese Communists in the Northeast in collusion with foreign forces and taking advantage of the opportunity of the unrecovered national sovereignty should be thoroughly eliminated and cannot be resolved through party negotiations to avoid future troubles. (6) Request the government to implement the ceasefire order thoroughly; military mediation is not applicable to the Northeast. (7) List Xiong Shihui's dereliction of duty and request the government to remove him from office and punish him severely to uphold the law and reassure the people of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>West Bank of the Liao River</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>The weather in March should be full of spring in the Jiangnan region. However, here it is desolate. A heavy snow a few days ago has covered the wilderness with a new silver coat.</p>
<p>In the sharp cold wind, the reporter stepped onto the "Gouying Road," a branch line of the Beining Railway from Goubangzi to Yingkou. Sadly, this railway is currently only partially open to traffic. The only destinations are the "Hujia" and "Panshan" stations. In the past, this branch line dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese South Manchuria Railway and played a role in maintaining the Northeast's transportation economy.</p>
<p>Leaving Goubangzi, the first thing that comes into view is the airfield. More than a dozen Japanese planes are parked on the field. The machinery inside the planes has been dismantled, leaving only the wreckage to be weathered.</p>
<p>The earth is boundless. Except for the short roots of rice seedlings left over from the autumn harvest and rows of earthen mounds, there is nothing else in the fields. Farming will have to wait for a while. Every year, the fertile, oily black soil yields abundant harvests.</p>
<p>Several small rivers cross the railway. The bridges have been damaged and, after repairs, can only barely support traffic. The train crawls slowly on the bridges, making people a little nervous. The houses at the bridgeheads and the equipment along the line also show signs of damage.</p>
<p>Who are the destroyers? Sadly, it is not an external force on this route, but our own Communist troops. Ordinary locals are saying: "The motherland fought hard for eight years, and the Northeast was lost for fourteen years. Even if we speed up construction, we still can't catch up with others. If this continues, we will never be able to turn over a new leaf!"</p>
<p>In the heavy snow, the train entered the first station, "Hujia." Hujia is a small station. The stationmaster's office is located in a small courtyard next to the station. South of the railway is a long village, "Hujia Fort," with six to seven hundred households, almost entirely farmers. Daily necessities must be purchased in Goubangzi. There is also a large row of houses north of the railway. Because there are stationed troops, small vendors selling melon seeds, peanuts, white pears, and cigarettes have been added.</p>
<p>A train is parked at the station. A young general is leading a group of military personnel, handling transportation maintenance and local security affairs. They have organized a militia and have also established six national schools in the surrounding areas, which has greatly helped the county government, which has extremely limited funds, in promoting education.</p>
<p>Moving forward in the wind and snow, armed brothers with guns are stationed at important intersections and river locations along the line. The situation seems a bit tense. It is said that the village chiefs and people in these villages are afraid of those plainclothes squads. They are often harassed, and in serious cases, they lose their lives because being close to the National Army is labeled as "traitorous."</p>
<p>We have arrived at "Panshan." Panshan is a larger station. The county seat is on the right side of the railway. There is no brick city, but rather a not-so-obvious earthen enclosure. Panshan did not have much production in the past. The land was barren, and the people were impoverished. The county was established late, so it does not have any famous attractions.</p>
<p>Recent years have been different. It has become a county with an astonishing rice yield. For the sake of war and the people's livelihoods, the Japanese developed Panshan's barren alkaline land, turning it into fertile fields, which was a great success. This place is called "Dawa," forty li north of the county seat.</p>
<p>The reason Panshan has so much alkaline land is due to the influence of the nearby coast. A "alkaline river" flows beside the county seat. The Japanese first had the puppet Manchukuo government use funds to buy 82,500 "tian" of land in the Dawa area (in the Northeast, it is customary to call ten mu of land a "tian"), and then moved a large number of Japanese and Korean farmers to cultivate the land. They used machinery to draw water from the Liao River, washing away the alkalinity and nourishing the fields. The trial planting of rice was successful.</p>
<p>Because it has not been open for long and is limited by manpower and funding, only 27,000 tian have been cultivated. Last year's rice harvest totaled 32,000 tons. This rice-producing area can be used as a state-run farm in our country.</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than 6,000 Japanese farmers and 9,000 Koreans there. In terms of technology, it is still necessary to use them, so they cannot all be repatriated.</p>
<p>The rice from Dawa is of excellent quality, but the grain reserves from last year have been gradually taken away recently. Now is the time to plan this year's farming. But it is in the hands of the Communist troops. The only hope is that the already cultivated land should not be allowed to become alkaline and barren again.</p>
<p>The entire county has two streets and sixteen villages. Currently, the county government controls only one county seat—the county seat is one street in the puppet Manchukuo street system—and seven villages in the west. The remaining Tianzhuangtai street and nine villages are in the hands of the Communist troops.</p>
<p>According to the county government's statistics, the county has a population of 310,000, with about 10,000 people in the county seat. There are 26 schools in the county, including one elementary school and one advanced elementary school in the county seat, as well as an agricultural elementary school. There are plans to convert it into a provincial junior high school, but due to all the turmoil, the work is yet to be carried out.</p>
<p>Business is slow in the shops in the town, and there are few goods in stock. Only a few restaurants and some small vendors selling cigarettes and snacks are doing business with the soldiers.</p>
<p>There is a large reed pond west of the county, about 120 li long from north to south and more than 30 li wide from east to west, supplying raw materials for the Jinzhou Paper Mill and another part for making reed mats. The Japanese once established a small reed mat factory.</p>
<p>A highway leading to Tianzhuangtai and Yingkou runs almost parallel to the "Gouying" railway and passes through the county. Facing the railway bridge is the Dabeng Bridge with 24 or 25 spans, with stone bases built in the flowing river water, which was a large-scale project. It is said that the Communist troops originally planned to burn it down when they retreated, but fortunately, it was left behind due to time constraints.</p>
<p>The county seat is surrounded by fortifications. The National and Communist troops are confronting each other within 20 li to the east, and the guard is quite strict. The "Shaling" that the Communist troops attacked from February 16th to 20th is a small town of more than 700 households, 60 li east of Panshan County.</p>
<p>Panshan County Chief Jin Boqi said: "I came to the county seat on December 14th last year to start the takeover. The Japanese and puppet regimes handled all the handover procedures very clearly, so the takeover work went smoothly. In general, the county government staff who stayed on regarded it as an honor to be Chinese again. In the two and a half months, although they only borrowed a small amount of salary, they were still happy to work. Unfortunately, on January 13th, the county seat was once captured by the Communist troops, resulting in heavy losses. On February 10th, the county was finally recovered by the National Army, and the county administration was reorganized. However, everything the county government had was swept away, and everything is very difficult!"</p>
<p>The snow is getting heavier and heavier. When the reporter left the county seat to the west, the snow had already reached a foot deep.</p>
<p>(Goubangzi, March 5th)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in the Northeast Can Be Avoided; Chairman Chiang Warned the Communist Party Not to Bring Misery to the People</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Chongqing News: Military intelligence indicates that the Communist troops' military probing and political testing in the Northeast failed in the final minutes of the Soviet troop withdrawal, but the opportunity to establish a foothold and sow seeds was obtained effortlessly. It is said that the three-member delegation of the Military Mediation Department is about to fly to the Northeast for inspection. The Communist troops seem to welcome this move extremely, because in this way, they can reap the fruits of victory empty-handed at an extremely low price and can also conceal the signs of their ineffective propaganda in the Northeast military severance. Based on this, it can be observed that using the method of military mediation to clarify the situation in the Northeast and first eliminate internal strife may not be the misfortune of the people of the Northeast. Also, this morning's news is that Chairman Chiang indirectly warned the Communist Party, "Do not use a little power of military force to bring misery to the people, attempt to win internal strife, and violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's expectations. Today, the two major parties should look far ahead, focus on the big picture, and not be preoccupied with partisan interests, to serve as an example for other political parties." This is truly a golden statement, enough to strike a blow to the ambitious individuals who are taking advantage of the situation in the Northeast, and internal strife in the Northeast may be avoided. The Soviet troop withdrawal from Changchun and Harbin seems to be pending. Military diplomacy will be deployed separately.</p>
<h3>Xiong and Zhang Return to the Northeast Soon; Military Diplomacy Will Be Deployed Separately</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Chongqing News: Political intelligence indicates that Xiong Shihui and Zhang Jia'ao are scheduled to fly back to the Northeast in the short term. Xiong may cancel his resignation. However, for the convenience of cleaning up the Northeast, there will be separate deployments for this local military command and diplomatic negotiations, which will be revealed in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Harbin Assassination Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 12th] Li Zhaolin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, and Chairman of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (original name Zhang Shouqian), was stabbed to death on Shuidao Street on the 9th. The Harbin Municipal Government is now dispatching police officers to strictly apprehend the murderer. It is learned that on that day, Mr. Li was traveling from his home to the association office when his car broke down midway. He switched to a rickshaw. Upon arrival, before removing his hat and coat, he went out, telling his secretary that he was going to No. 9 Shuidao Street to meet a friend for a brief discussion and would return shortly. He did not return by evening. Association staff went to the address twice but found no one there. The next day, Mayor Yang reported this matter and instructed the police bureau to send officers to search No. 9 Shuidao Street. Mr. Li's body was discovered in a locked empty room above the second gate. After receiving the report, Mayor Yang and the Chairman of the Songjiang Customs immediately notified the Soviet side. Following examination by Chinese and Soviet inspectors and forensic doctors, it was determined that the cause of death was knife wounds. The body was transferred to a Soviet military hospital for autopsy.</p>
<h3>The CCP Has Established "Provincial Governments" in Jilin and Longjiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] During the suspension of the Northeast takeover work, the CCP took the opportunity to actively expand its military power and create a regime. Jilin Province has already established a provincial government through a so-called People's Representative Congress, with Zhou Baozhong as Chairman. Now, Heilongjiang has also established a "provincial government" and convened a so-called People's Representative Congress. It is claimed that this provincial government was established by the People's Self-Defense Army in November of last year. According to Han Junjie, the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, who left Changchun on January 23rd to go north for the takeover, he is still stranded in Harbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 13th] According to a contact person from Bei'an to the provincial government, there are over 20,000 Communist troops within Heilongjiang, stationed in various counties within the province. Under the slogan of building a new democratic government, they forcibly conscript civilians to form the People's Autonomous Army, also known as the Militia, to replenish their forces. Any resistance is met with the death penalty. According to the Harbin Communist Party's newspaper, the province established a provincial government in Bei'an on November 1st of last winter, with Chen Dafan as Chairman and Yang Yingjie as Vice-Chairman. Furthermore, Yu Tianfang, Zhang Guangdi, Wang Jun, Chen Lei, and others formed the People's Autonomous Army. Of the nine provinces in the Northeast, Heilongjiang has suffered the most devastation at the hands of the populace. On February 1st, the puppet provincial Chairman Chen Dafan convened the so-called first People's Representative Congress. Several days ago, Vice-Chairman Yang Yingjie led eight puppet county magistrates and six guards to Harbin and stayed at the train station to meet with the Soviet military authorities.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Rewards American Troops - Distributes Prizes to Ten People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education stated that in order to reward the hard work of the American troops who fought in China during the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education is awarding prizes to ten former American officers and soldiers who served in China. Regardless of whether they are currently in China, these American officers and soldiers can apply to the Sino-American Cultural and Material Supply Committee for approval, after which each person will receive a prize of US$1,500 per year, for a total of three years.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Formally Announces - Abandonment of Special Privileges in China</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Swiss Capital, 13th] According to an official announcement, Switzerland and China have signed an agreement here stipulating that Switzerland will abandon its consular jurisdiction in China. However, the existing most-favored-nation treatment will remain valid until a new treaty is concluded between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Withdraw from Siping Street - Communist Troops Take the Opportunity to Attack the Suburbs Twice - Telephone Lines Between Shenyang and Changchun Malfunction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 13th] Shenyang, 13th Telegram: The National Army in Tiexi, having been stationed since January 5th, after a month and twenty-five days, formally entered the Shenyang city at 6:00 PM on the 13th. As they passed through the city in vehicles, the citizens cheered and rejoiced. It is now that day that the city defense order has been received.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 13th] Shenyang, 13th Telegram: The entire city here today is beaming with joy, exchanging knowing smiles, as if a heavy burden accumulated over many years has been suddenly lifted, making everyone feel incredibly light. The National Army set out from Tiexi district yesterday and entered the city in the evening. As their passage through the urban area was limited and they remained stationed outside the city, only a few citizens were aware of their presence. However, this morning, the Commander of the 52nd Army, Zhao Gongwu, led his troops into the city. The Sino-Soviet Daily, which was recently published here, even printed an extra edition, causing the entire city to rejoice. Citizens crowded the streets. This "Chicago of the East," with its two million citizens, seemed to be revived from near death, eagerly spreading the news of the National Army's entry into the city. The joy was beyond measure, and upon witnessing the majesty of the National Army, some people could not help but shed tears of joy, saying, "You've finally arrived!" A military-political soiree will be held tonight at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, so that these long-suppressed feelings can be fully expressed and shared at the party, to commemorate this historical night. The Soviet Commander, Gafutang, was originally scheduled to leave Shenyang today, but he notified last night that the problem of his transportation has been resolved, and so he withdrew from here last night, leading to the cancellation of the farewell soiree scheduled for today. Commander Zhao Gongwu told reporters that there are no issues with Shenyang's security. Currently, in addition to the National Army being stationed in various factories and workplaces, the remaining areas are patrolled by the police. Furthermore, the entire Beining Railway is now open and unobstructed. Although some places suffered minor damage in the past, they have now been completely repaired.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Siping Street, 14th Urgent Telegram] The Soviet troops here have now been redeployed. Before their departure, they notified the Liaobei Provincial Government that they are no longer responsible for maintaining security. The Soviet troops withdrew from the outposts on the outskirts of the city on the 9th, and that night, Communist troops launched an attack. They launched another attack on the 11th. Now that the Soviet troops have completely withdrawn, they are advancing step by step. The suburbs have been extremely unstable in recent days. The provincial capital's security team and the police are doing their best to maintain order. Provincial Chairman Liu Handong is determined to defend to the death. Furthermore, the County Magistrate of Changtu County has been captured by the Communist troops, and the Lishu County government is heavily besieged. The situation is extremely urgent.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Transportation circles report that long-distance telephone lines between Changchun and Shenyang have now malfunctioned.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Authoritative sources here believe that, apart from a small number of troops remaining in Dalian and Lushun, the Soviet troops intend to withdraw from the southeastern region of the nine northeastern provinces and leave the majority of their troops stationed in the northwestern region along the Vladivostok-Harbin line. It is claimed that this plan will make the Soviet border a straight line, stretching from Vladivostok across the Northeast to Mongolia, thereby eliminating what the Soviet Union has always considered a threat to its coastal province.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops in Greater Britain - Advance Towards the Turkish Border on Three Routes - Wealthy Iranians Flee to Seek Refuge</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department has recently issued a statement saying it has received highly reliable information that Soviet troops stationed in Iran are continuing to move.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 14th Broadcast: The number of Soviet troops, which had doubled to 60,000 in the past 30 days, some of them have already left Greater Britain, and are rapidly advancing in three directions towards the Turkish border. Wealthy Iranians are fleeing Tehran to seek refuge. Some of the Soviet troops withdrawing from Greater Britain are heading north towards Maragheh, while others are advancing directly towards Kio City on the Turkish border. At the same time, some Soviet troops are also moving towards Maragheh and Miandoab, creating a tense situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 14th] A detachment of Soviet troops departing from Tabriz, Iranian Azerbaijan, is reported to have turned west towards the Turkish border.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Turkish Capital, 14th] As Soviet troops move to reinforce western Iran, Soviet newspapers and radio stations are repeatedly conducting anti-Turkish propaganda campaigns, which has increased unease among the people here. Although it is generally believed that these troops will not exert pressure on Turkey in the short term, the appearance of Soviet armored units and cavalry units not far from the Turkish border can be seen as a prelude to the arrival of a threat. As a result of the Soviet Union's recent actions, Iraq has realized that its position is almost identical to that of Turkey.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Al-Haji, declared today that the Soviet troops moving south towards Tehran may be aimed at Iraq, Turkey, or Iran itself. This Soviet move is completely unexpected. However, the situation in Iran is no longer a war of nerves. It is expected that the Soviet Union will soon make demands on Turkey, which may include the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, and a Soviet base in the Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] It was learned today from reliable sources that the Turkish Embassy in the United States has not received any information from Ankara regarding the concentration of Soviet troops in the Iranian Azerbaijan province.

The three cities of Maragheh, and Miandoab are located south of Greater Britain, with the latter being 110 kilometers from the intersection of the Turkish, Iranian, and Iraqi borders.</p>
<h3>Bevin Condemns Soviet Violation of Agreement in the House of Commons - Declares British Troops Have No Intention of Re-entering Iran</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 14th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons today that if Soviet troops withdraw from Iran, Britain will agree to the Security Council's decision and allow direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran.</p>
<p>Bevin condemned the Soviet Union for violating the agreement by not withdrawing its Soviet troops stationed in Iran by March 2nd. Bevin stated that British troops withdrew from Iran on March 2nd as agreed and have no intention of returning to the country. Bevin also said that Stalin had guaranteed Iran's independence, and the Soviet Union's current actions are puzzling.</p>
<p>Another report: Two months ago, there were only 30,000 Soviet troops stationed in Azerbaijan, but the number has now doubled.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] The British representative in Tehran has sent a telegram confirming the U.S. State Department's statement regarding the movement of Soviet troops. Sources familiar with the matter said that Bevin had been in communication with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes in the past 24 hours, with the situation in Iran being the most notable topic. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, denied that Prime Minister Attlee had spoken with U.S. President Truman by telephone.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Byrnes reported to President Truman today on the urgent developments in the international situation, with the main focus being the Soviet Union's troop increase in Iran. According to telegrams received here, Soviet troops in Karaj are equipped with Sherman tanks, which has drawn attention from government officials. These tanks were delivered to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program for use in the war against Germany. Under the current circumstances, if the Soviet Union uses Lend-Lease military equipment in Iran, the United States may file a new protest with the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Stalin Comments on Churchill's Speech - Hindering UN Cooperation - Accuses Churchill of Inciting War Against the Soviet Union - Churchill Refuses to Comment on Stalin's Remarks</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 13th] A reporter from "Pravda" asked Stalin to comment on Churchill's recent speech. Stalin replied, "I believe that Churchill's purpose is to sow discord among the United Nations and hinder cooperation between them. In terms of peace and security, Churchill has taken the position of a war agitator."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcasted today a talk between Marshal Stalin and a reporter from "Pravda." According to Stalin, several points made by Churchill in his speech in Fulton, Missouri, regarding Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary were lies. He added, "Churchill's speech</p>
<p>was very dangerous. Churchill advocated war against the Soviet Union, while at the same time proposing a 50-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. Such a treaty is bound to be a mere formality, with no value. The Soviet Union sacrificed 7 million people in this war, exceeding the combined losses of Britain and the United States. Churchill said that the current government of Poland is under Soviet influence, and that the Soviet Union is demanding too much from Germany. This is not true. Poland has chosen a new path and is unwilling to follow the direction indicated by Churchill, which has disappointed him. Churchill wants Yugoslavia to be ruled by Mihailović and the royal family, but it should be known that the power of the Communist Party today is the result of their struggle for national freedom. Churchill mentioned the common people in his speech. He was rejected and dismissed from his position by the common people in Britain. Now, such actions are happening throughout Europe, which of course is not something Churchill likes. Churchill once wanted to organize a 'crusade' against the Soviet Union. Whether this move will succeed is doubtful. However, Churchill's speech is a dangerous action, aiming to sow seeds of division among countries and hinder continued cooperation. Churchill is currently participating in something that not only has people echoing his sentiments in Britain, but also in the United States. However, it must be pointed out that Churchill and his friends remind people of Hitler and his friends. Hitler adopted racial theories to establish his war doctrine, declaring that only those who speak Germanic languages are pure races. Churchill also advocates war using racial theories, granting privileges to English-speaking nations and giving them the power to decide the fate of the world. The Germanic race theory made Hitler's faction believe that they were the only nation entitled to rule other countries. Now, Churchill's faction also claims that English-speaking countries should be the supreme rulers of the world. Churchill and his friends in Britain and the United States are now issuing an ultimatum to non-English-speaking countries, saying, "If you automatically recognize our superiority, everything will be fine. Otherwise, war is inevitable." People of all countries</p>
<p>shed blood for five years in order to fight for national freedom and independence, not merely to replace Hitler's rule with Churchill's rule. Today, non-English-speaking countries represent the majority of the world's population. It is easy to understand why they do not want to become new slaves. But Churchill cannot understand this simple and clear truth, which is Churchill's tragedy. Examining Churchill's purpose, it is clear that he is launching a war against the Soviet Union. However, while advocating war against the Soviet Union, he also proposed extending the Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty to 50 years. His intention is nothing more than to regard the treaty as a mere formality, only to use it as a cover to conceal his anti-Soviet activities."</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] Churchill declined to comment on Stalin's remarks to a "Pravda" reporter.</p>
<h3>What are Soviet Tank Experts Doing in Iran?</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] Reliable sources state: Soviet tank expert Baghramyan is currently in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Emergency of the Middle East Situation</h3>
<p>At a time when the situation in the Northeast remains heavily clouded, news from the Middle East is making us feel the urgency of the situation there. From Turkey to Iran, the severity of the situation is increasing daily. According to an Associated Press report from Tehran on the 13th, the most reliable sources say that Soviet troops are moving along northern Iran towards the southwestern Turkish and Iraqi borders, and Soviet troops and armored vehicles have entered Karaj, 20 miles from Tehran. News from Azerbaijan Province is that a Soviet cavalry unit is advancing in a fan shape towards Iran from the city of Astara on the Caspian coast. Well-equipped Soviet troops have entered Mianeh, Maragheh, and Miyandoab near the southern end of Lake Urmia. The lake is located near the border between Iraq and Turkey. In addition, according to our news: A broadcast from London on the 13th reports that Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Al-Haji said today that Soviet pressure on Turkey has moved beyond the stage of a war of nerves, and fighting is expected to break out soon on the Turkish border. Also, according to a United Press report from Washington on the 12th: According to information obtained by the U.S. State Department, more Soviet troops and heavy weapons have recently moved from the Soviet border through Greater Britain towards Tehran. From these reports, it can be seen that the Soviet military operations from the Turkish-Iraqi border to northern Iran are clearly a planned and large-scale operation. Its intention does not seem to be limited to Iran, but actually includes a vast area from Turkey to Iran.</p>
<p>Regarding the Iranian issue, Britain and the United States have submitted notes to the Soviet Union several times, and even raised it at the first session of the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council held four days of heated debate on the Iranian issue, and finally decided that the Soviet Union and Iran should engage in direct negotiations. However, this decision did not resolve the problem in Iran. The Soviet troops' occupation of northern Iran was originally a necessary measure for fighting the Axis powers. Now that the war is over, they should withdraw and allow Iran to freely exercise its political power. However, not only have Soviet troops not withdrawn, they have recently been carrying out divisive activities in Azerbaijan Province, further complicating the situation in Iran. Now that the United Nations Security Council has decided that the Soviet Union and Iran should engage in direct negotiations, and the current Iranian government cannot be tolerated by the Soviet Union, direct negotiations have not made progress. The Soviet troops' current advance into Iran, as the Associated Press of Washington said on the 13th, is aimed at forcing Iran to establish a pro-Soviet government and consolidate its border strategic zone.</p>
<p>However, the scope of this Soviet troop advance is not limited to Iran, but also includes the Turkish border and the Iraqi border. The Soviet Union's dispute with Turkey and Iraq is ostensibly over the issue of Kurdish autonomy and the demand to "recover lost border territories." Although the Soviet Union is ostensibly an outsider in the issue of Kurdish autonomy, behind-the-scenes involvement cannot be ruled out. Recovering lost border territories is settling old scores, and Turkey will certainly not easily transfer or divide its territory. Moreover, the problem here is not that simple. The Iraqi port of Basra has access to the Indian Ocean, and the area has rich oil fields. Turkey controls the Dardanelles Strait, the gateway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. This Soviet military action is more of an attempt to exert pressure on Turkey to obtain the rights to the Dardanelles Strait and force Turkey and Iraq to establish pro-Soviet regimes than an attempt to recover lost border territories.</p>
<p>The problem in the Middle East appears in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey; but in fact, there is only one: a powerful neighbor is attempting to establish regimes in these areas that are favorable to itself by force. This clearly violates the principle of national self-determination. If this policy is realized, then the principles for which countless people sacrificed in the Great War will be abandoned, and the world will return to a dark age. Therefore, the situation in the Middle East is not a question of Anglo-Soviet rivalry, but a more important question: the self-determination and survival of nations, and the question of the strong bullying the weak. For this question, humanity had this Great War; now that the war has just ended, this question is appearing everywhere, from the Mediterranean Sea, Central Europe, through the Near East, to the Northeast on the Pacific coast. The recent developments in the Middle East deserve attention; they harbor danger. China, having experienced a long war of resistance, feels especially keenly about the indivisibility of war. A single spark can start a prairie fire. How to save humanity from another catastrophe depends on the great demeanor of the current leaders.</p>
<h3>Consistent Anglo-American Public Opinion Criticizes Stalin's Remarks; Deems Stalin's Words Coarse and Unreasonable; His Actions Resemble Hitler's</h3>
<p>America</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th Dispatch] Following Stalin's attack on Churchill's speech, the New York Times published an editorial stating: "If the Soviet Union truly wishes to provide Churchill with an effective response, Moscow should adhere to the guarantees, agreements, and treaties it has made with other countries. In doing so, the entire international tension would immediately vanish." The New York Times further reminded the Soviet Union that it would be mistaken if it believed that the hesitation expressed by the U.S. Congress towards Churchill's speech presented an opportunity to divide Anglo-American friendship.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] The Conservative Party's Daily Mail and the Daily Chronicle both criticized Stalin's remarks to a Pravda reporter this morning. The Daily Mail stated: "Marshal Stalin's personal abuse of Churchill is despicable and regrettable. These are not the words of a statesman. One can judge a person by their words. He has little to say about the current international crisis, and can only explain the world's tension as being caused by the Soviet Union's power politics and aggression towards its neighbors, but this does not absolve the Soviet Union of its responsibility. The Soviet Union's actions are comparable to the situation before World War III. The situation in Iran has reverted to the European political landscape of 1938-1939. The Czech Republic back then is today's Iran, the only difference being that today's developments are happening faster. The Soviet Union's actions are even worse than those of pre-war Germany. Hitler allowed for the respect of the borders agreed upon at the Munich Conference, yet six months later, he sent troops into Bohemia and Moravia; the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its troops from Iran simultaneously with Britain, yet it broke its promise. Hitler and Stalin share another unfortunate similarity: both use security as an excuse to justify their acts of aggression. Who can attack the Soviet Union?"</p>
<p>The Daily Chronicle stated: "Only British diplomatic skills and the moral pressure of the United Nations organization can prevent another war. Unfortunately, Stalin's attack on Churchill has not alleviated the tension. Stalin's words are coarse and unreasonable. It must be understood that abuse cannot answer the points raised by Churchill. His comparison of Churchill to Hitler is simply unbelievable and is not the attitude expected of one of the three great leaders who fought against Germany."</p>
<h3>White House Secretary Denies Three-Power Conference Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch, United Press] Truman's press secretary, Ross, stated today that rumors that President Truman is planning another three-power conference are "not very accurate." These rumors originated from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's expression of willingness to discuss the tense relations with Byrnes, and a secret meeting held with former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman. Reporters asked Ross about the following rumors: (1) Is the President planning to find a way to convene a three-power conference? (2) Has the President spoken with Prime Minister Attlee by telephone? Is he planning to speak directly with Stalin? (3) If the Soviet Union does not withdraw its troops from Iran, will the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union? Ross did not answer any of these questions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] British Members of Parliament have asked Prime Minister Attlee to reply as to whether he intends to initiate a three-power conference. The Prime Minister stated that he would take any steps that could improve relations between the major powers, but that it was not appropriate to take any measures at present.</p>

Furthermore, the Italian and Slovenian Alliance Committee yesterday submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Investigation Committee, urging Yugoslavia to merge the entire Trieste area and the Province of Isonzo in order to form the ninth state of the Yugoslav Federation. Their proposed border clearly crosses west of the old Morgan Line, cutting off several Italian villages from the mainland. In addition, rumors from the American side that Yugoslav troops have crossed or attempted to cross the Morgan border have been denied by United Nations authorities.</p>
<h3>US Responds to Soviet Accusations on Troop Presence in Middle East</h3>

<h3>UNRRA Convenes Meeting to Discuss Future Relief Plans; Hoover May Succeed Director</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th Dispatch] Representatives from the 47 member countries of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) are scheduled to meet on Friday in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The main issue for discussion will be whether the European relief program can be extended to next year. UNRRA's relief funds will be completely exhausted by next March, and all relief funds for January, February, and March of next year have been designated entirely for the countries of the Far East, especially China. UNRRA is now seeking to avoid asking the United Nations to make a third donation, as the U.S. Congress may not be willing to make a third consecutive annual donation of $1.35 billion. If this Atlantic City meeting does not find a solution to this matter, it may be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. Another hope is that if the International Bank can be established in a timely manner, it may be able to release loans for food and reconstruction by the end of this year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th Dispatch] UNRRA Director Lehman has submitted his resignation yesterday due to poor health.

<h3>US Celebrities Meet to Discuss Revising the UN Charter; Plan to Establish a World Federal Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Winter Park, Florida, 13th Dispatch] Approximately 20 prominent figures from the American scientific, industrial, religious, literary, educational, and labor communities are meeting here, with the aim of reviewing how to revise the United Nations Charter in order to establish a world "Federal Government." The matters discussed at the meeting all arose from concerns about the horrors of atomic warfare. The representatives have already passed the following resolution: "In today's world, no nation can hope that its strength and sovereignty are great enough to protect its people in wartime. The generation and maintenance of world peace can only be achieved through world law, the effectiveness of which must be extensive and strong enough to prevent war between nations. Therefore, to ensure our survival, we must unite with other nations to establish a world constitutional federal government, giving it the necessary strength to maintain world peace in general based on legal justice." The representatives then passed a resolution stating that the best way to achieve this goal is to start by revising the United Nations Charter. One representative suggested establishing a world parliament and a world court within the United Nations organization, as well as another world organization to arrest and prosecute those who violate world law.</p>

On November 10th of that year, he and his wife, Lu Huimin, were arrested at their residence at No. 28, Lane 672, Pushi Road, and imprisoned in the enemy's Bédan Road Gendarmerie. They were subjected to torture to extract confessions. Martyr Du remained steadfast and unyielding, and was killed on November 17th, heroically sacrificing his life for his country. His wife was later released. After the victory, it was discovered that Huang Liewen was suspected of collaborating with the enemy, so he was arrested and transferred to the Higher Procuratorate for investigation, and a formal public prosecution has been initiated. Huang Liewen is a native of Songjiang, 38 years old. In his early years, he held high-ranking positions in the central military and political circles. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to recruit students from the 20th class of the military academy. He had a</p>
<p>Brief Encounter</p>
<p>with Du in Tunxi. After coming to Shanghai to work, he was arrested and imprisoned by the enemy gendarmerie, and released after six months. He then remained in Shanghai. In the 33rd year of the Republic, he was appointed as the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate through the introduction of Zhou Fohai, and remained in that position until the victory. Du's arrest and martyrdom were due to Huang's secret report, as witnessed by Ms. Zhang Yulin. Because of the meritorious service of the secret report, in addition to being appointed as the county magistrate, Huang was also rewarded by the enemy gendarmerie with a residence, a car, rice flour, and other items. During the court session yesterday afternoon in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, when Judge Cai Jin opened the court to question the defendant, he</p>
<p>Eloquently Denied</p>
<p>that he had ever secretly reported against Du Gang. He claimed that after being arrested and released in Shanghai, he was under surveillance and could not escape. The enemy and the puppet regime had repeatedly coerced him to reveal the whereabouts of underground work leaders Jiang Bocheng, Wu Shaoshu, and Du Gang, but he always claimed that they were in Tunxi. "I don't know Du Gang's residence at all, so how could I have made a secret report? As for serving as the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, I obtained the consent of the responsible authorities. I used my position to protect underground work. I set up the communication radio station of the Third War Area inside the county government, and also reorganized the local puppet security team into the Third War Area's Pioneer Army. Furthermore, I persuaded the reorganization of troops in Jinshan and Songjiang counties. At the same time, I successively released more than one hundred underground work comrades who had been arrested and imprisoned. This can be investigated. If Martyr Du was indeed killed by me, I am willing to commit suicide in court to apologize to the people of the country." At the same time, he also requested that Lieutenant Colonel Sugihara and Lieutenant Miyamoto, the commanders of the enemy gendarmerie on Bédan Road, be summoned as witnesses. Then, Du Lu Huimin gave a detailed account of</p>
<p>The Ordeal of Suffering</p>
<p>stating that Ms. Zhang Yulin had witnessed the defendant making a secret report. When she described the tragic state of Martyr Du's body after his death, with dozens of knife wounds on his head and back, and his right hand severed, she was overcome with grief, burst into tears, and sobbed incoherently. Because Zhang Yulin had not arrived, after the court summoned Shen Zhiyan, an underground worker who had been rescued and released by Huang Liewen, it ordered that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3>Four Cases of Fang Jie et al.</h3>
<p>Fang Jie, a political section member of the Special High Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, had helped the enemy arrest members of the Pinghu Loyal Salvation Army and members of the Kuomintang party who broadcast this news on the Huangpu Radio Station immediately after the victory. During the court session yesterday, the victims Kong Shanghou, Cai Zhijun, Zhu Liwen, and Liu Baochun came to court to recount their experiences. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Bao to defend him. The court ordered the case to be adjourned to another date for further hearing.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the High Court also heard the case of Wang Mingqian, Jin Yunsheng, Wu Quangen, and Qiao Shulin, who were accused of serving as secret agents for the Bédan Road enemy gendarmerie. The defendants were reported by Qiao Liangbo, Zhu Xiqing, Chen Dongguo, Qiao Junshan, Zhu Hanchen, and other villagers from the Beiqiao District of Shanghai County. After questioning, the court ordered the case to be adjourned to another date for further hearing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the case of Zhao Riliang, the head of the Ideological Section of the Special High Section of the Puppet Weihaiwei Police Bureau in Shandong and the deputy director of the Puppet Dinghai County Police Bureau, was debated in court yesterday afternoon. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Shouan to defend him. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and the verdict to be announced on the 21st in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The verdict in the case of Lin Zhixing, the translator for the Zhenru enemy gendarmerie, will be announced this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Military Tribunal Extends Trial Date</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The First Pacification Headquarters was ordered to organize the Shanghai Military Tribunal and has selected the original site of the Third Front Army Headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road as its office. Dr. Liu Shifang, the presiding judge of the High Court, has been appointed as the presiding judge, and Qu Shize and others have been designated as judges, and Lin Wopeng and others as prosecutors. The original plan was to establish the tribunal and begin operations today, but due to the impact of the water and woodworkers' strike, the interior has not yet been fully repaired. Therefore, the formal trial of war criminals must be held after the 20th. It is rumored that the first batch of those to be tried are six Japanese prisoners reported by Fang Er in Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Miki Sui Spared from Death, Sentenced to 25 Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Miki Sui, a Japanese war criminal who previously served as a administrator at a U.S. military concentration camp near Shenyang, was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment and hard labor by the U.S. military court yesterday. The sentencing lasted only three minutes. However, the charge of murdering American naval prisoners of war named Zhong could not be established due to insufficient evidence. Therefore, his crimes were only of mistreatment and abuse of prisoners of war. Before hearing the verdict, Miki's face was pale, and he showed obvious signs of fear and trepidation. After the verdict was pronounced, although he was calmer, his fear and tension still remained.</p>
<h3>A Traitorous Puppet Officer in Zhenhai Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Zuying, a native of Zhenhai, formerly served as a detective in the Puppet Zhenhai Police Bureau. He colluded with puppet officers to search Gu Chongwen's home, a resident of the Jiangnan Xiaodaotou area of Zhenhai, and confiscated ten self-defense rifles and four hundred rounds of ammunition from the fields, which were handed over to the puppet security team to strengthen the enemy and puppet forces. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai to evade justice. Unexpectedly, he encountered Gu at the 16th Pier on the 5th of this month and was taken to the Yimiao Sub-bureau. It is now known that he has been transferred to the High Court Procuratorate for legal action.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of an Indian in a Murder Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] An Indian man named Lai Ximenxing was indicted for murder. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhu Nianci of the District Court opened a criminal court to interrogate him. Witnesses Pan A Jin and Sa Benxing were brought to court. After a detailed interrogation, the defendant was ordered to be returned to custody, and the hearing was adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>The Huge Embezzlement Case at Guanda Hua Bank on the Bund is Solved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At Guanda Hua Bank, No. 1 The Bund, on the evening of the 6th of last month, the glass windows along Zhongzheng Road were broken, and several thieves broke in. They dug open the silver safe and stole US$59,200 in banknotes, 45 gold bars weighing a total of 63 taels and 8 fen, and 21 pieces of gold jewelry, among other items. After the bank reported the case to the police, Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the Second Criminal Division, ordered his officers to solve the case as soon as possible. On the morning of the 7th of this month, a thief named Yang Amao was arrested at No. 607 Guangdong Road. On the evening of the 8th, another accomplice, Liu Sanbao (27 years old, from Ningbo), was arrested at No. 10, Lane 3, Menghua Street, in the South City. Wang Xiugen (26 years old, from Pudong) was arrested at No. 132 Qiujiang Road. Another suspect, Fang Abing (27 years old, from Anhui), was also apprehended. One-quarter of the stolen goods were recovered, including US$9,040 in banknotes, one large gold ingot weighing eight taels, two small gold ingots, each weighing one tael, two gold bracelets, three gold rings, and more than 260 pieces of gray leather, divided into five bundles.

<h3>Negotiations to Purchase 10,000 Prefabricated Houses - There is Such a Saying</h3>
<p>The housing shortage in this city is extremely serious, and there is currently no appropriate solution, which often leads to disputes between landlords and tenants. According to a report by the New Shanghai News Agency, there are 10,000 prefabricated houses among the surplus materials of the US military in the Pacific, and the Chinese government is currently formally negotiating with the US government to purchase them. It is reported that most of them will be used in Nanjing and Shanghai to provide housing for civil servants after the return to the capital. If this is the case, the housing shortage problem in Nanjing and Shanghai may be slightly alleviated.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Seductive Corpse Case on the Roof of the Taishan Apartments Comes to Light</h3>
<p>Reliving Old Dreams · Jealousy Arouses Waves · A Life Lost · The Accomplices Are Captured After Many Twists and Turns; the Main Culprit is Still at Large</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the afternoon of the 10th, a seductively dressed female corpse was discovered on the roof of the fourth floor of the Taishan Apartments, No. 3, Lane 622, Xiafei Road. Detailed reports have been published in this newspaper, and the incident caused a sensation in society and was considered a strange event. The responsible Lujiawan Police Station attached great importance to the case and sent out detectives day and night to investigate. Within more than forty hours, the accomplices were captured, and the main culprit is at large. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>On the day the case occurred, the Lujiawan Sub-bureau received a report and Deputy Director Li Junhou personally led Inspector Xue Minjie, Ni Jiafeng, staff member Ma Bingzhang, Police Chief Zhang Jun, and others to the scene to conduct a detailed investigation. They studied the victim's injuries and examined the type of bullet casings. A staff member recognized the deceased as someone he had met at a banquet once, only remembering that she lived near Carter Road, but not knowing the number. After searching for several hours, they finally located her husband, Yue Nianzhao, at No. 33, Lane 146, Carter Road. At that time, Yue was not yet aware of his wife, Chen Huifang's, tragic death. According to Yue, he was unemployed, and his livelihood was becoming increasingly difficult. Huifang, forced by economic circumstances, returned to her previous profession as a prostitute at the Red Pearl Brothel in Huile Lane on the 24th of the old calendar year, using the name "Old Seventh."</p>
<p>Therefore, the police officers followed this lead and went directly to the Red Pearl Brothel to investigate in detail. According to the madam, a Mr. Chen came to the brothel for tea last Thursday. Before leaving, he summoned Old Seventh and said, "I will host a party here tomorrow. Please prepare dishes." Unexpectedly, at 5:00 the next day, Mr. Chen suddenly called, saying that his arm was broken and the party would be postponed. Old Seventh was immediately displeased upon hearing this. Then, her friend Lin Buwu (also known as Yiming) invited her to meet at the Great China Cafe, and Wang Zhengzhong and two people surnamed Bu came to the brothel to "have some fun." She also called Xue and Zhang to join the banquet. When the guests dispersed, Lin borrowed 30,000 yuan from Bu to pay for the feast. Two days later, Old Seventh suddenly went out and never returned.</p>
<p>Inspector Ni and others knew that to solve this case, they had to start with the brothel. Therefore, they repeatedly visited the brothel after the case occurred to investigate. At 6:00 PM on the 11th, when they went again, Xue happened to call, inviting Seventh to have coffee at the Great China Cafe. The police officers immediately rushed to the Great China Cafe and captured Xue. After questioning, it was learned that Wang and Lin were highly suspicious, but their addresses were unknown. They only learned that Lin was cohabiting with a woman named Lin Huiying, and Huiying's sister lived on Father Du Road. After going there, they found Huiying's sister, and thus learned that Lin was at No. 27, Yi'an Village, Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai.</p>
<p>The next day, the police officers went to Yi'an Village and knocked on the door of the landlord of No. 27, who said that Mr. Lin and his family planned to go to Suzhou this morning. At this time, Wang and Lin suddenly entered the alley together. Xue identified them without error. Staff member Ma Bingzhang bravely held on to Wang, who tried to draw his gun but failed. He was then struck hard by Inspector Ni, and the gun fell to the ground. He was captured on the spot. Lin Yiming managed to escape into the crowd. The police officers took everyone to the station and interrogated them closely, finally understanding the details of this murder case.</p>
<p>It turned out that Xue was Old Seventh's former lover. Meeting again after a long time, they were both surprised and delighted. Xue asked Seventh why she was there. Seventh told him that her husband, Nianzhao, was unemployed, leaving her with no choice. That night, after leaving the brothel, Xue and Seventh went to a hotel for a rendezvous. Therefore, Lin and Wang expressed deep dissatisfaction with Seventh. They agreed to have tea somewhere the next morning to discuss a plan to deal with her. The idea of killing Seventh had already arisen in their minds.</p>
<p>The next day, Lin and Wang went to Taishan Apartments first and lingered for a long time, then went back separately. At around 1:00 PM on the 10th, they agreed to have lunch at the Dasanyuan Restaurant on Xizang Road, and also called Old Seventh, who suspected nothing and happily went. After eating, Lin and Wang took Seventh in three rickshaws to Taishan Apartments, claiming they were visiting friends. They went straight to the flat roof on the fourth floor. Seeing that there was no one around, Lin took out a gun and fired. The first shot missed, but a bullet was fired and hit her face, killing her. At that time, Seventh was wearing two diamond rings, one large ring weighing 60 points, and a small ring with four diamond heads, as well as 7,000 yuan in legal tender, all of which were snatched by Lin and taken away. The two men took a bus to a jewelry store on Hankou Road and sold the large diamond ring for 350,000 yuan in foreign currency. The small one was sold to a store on Jiangxi Road for 150,000 yuan in legal tender. Lin gave Wang 30,000 yuan. On the 11th, Wang went to Wang's residence at No. 27, Yi'an Village, Yidingpan Road for lunch. Lin gave him another 70,000 yuan and told him to keep the matter a secret.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, Lin saw that the Shen Bao had reported the murder case at Taishan Apartments. He immediately told the landlord that he planned to go to Suzhou and took the newspaper to visit Wang at No. 161 Yaozhujiao Road, telling him that the matter had been exposed and discussing their escape together. Lin and Wang returned to Yi'an Village and prepared to pack everything and leave, but they were arrested there. According to Wang's confession, Lin, 37 years old, is from Fujian and graduated from the Guangdong Police Academy. He is currently a major detachment commander of the Second Brigade of the Security Regiment of the Kunshan County Government, skilled in marksmanship. Police officers also searched Lin's residence but found nothing of value. Deputy Director Li was afraid that he would flee to another location. He quickly went to the Baocheng Section of the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau and issued Lin's portrait, sending police to guard the military station. Although he has not yet been apprehended, he will eventually be brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Labor Department Hosts Reporters, Reports on Materials Clearing Situation; $20 Million in US Materials to be Sold to Our Country; Mayor Qian Hosts Labor Department for a Wash-Dust Banquet at His Private Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The US military surplus materials investigation team, organized by US Undersecretary of the Army Labor and McKieber, Special Commissioner of the Overseas Clearing Committee, held talks with the US military authorities stationed in China at the Construction Building on the eighth floor yesterday morning. After the meeting at 11:20, they continued to host reporters from various newspapers in this city to report on the situation of overseas material clearing. Undersecretary Labor, McKieber, Lieutenant General Luo Ci, Commander of the US Army Service Team, Major General Parks, Director of the Army Liaison Office, and Major General Johnson, President of the Overseas Clearing Committee in China, attended and answered various questions.</p>
<p>Investigating Surplus Materials in War Zones</p>
<p>Labor said that the main task of the investigation team is to inspect the surplus materials of the US military in various war zones in the Pacific. After the US military's remaining items are officially designated as surplus materials, the Overseas Clearing Committee is responsible for handling and selling them. If there are items needed by the United States, they will still be transported back. Some munitions can also be sold, but there are still some military weapons that are dangerous in nature, so they have been thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>The Clearing Committee Assists in Transportation</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to estimate the total value of the surplus materials in the Pacific region. However, there are US$25 million worth of materials in Calcutta that will be sold to China in full. The priority for purchasing surplus materials is first for US government agencies, second for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and then for China. Currently, in addition to China, the Netherlands and New Zealand have also requested to purchase, but the amount is small. The Soviet Union has not yet applied. As for transportation, it should be handled by the purchasing country, but the Clearing Committee has decided to try its best to assist. Labor and others are scheduled to leave here today for Manila to continue their inspection. Mayor Qian Dajun held a cocktail party at his private residence on Jisi Feier Road at 5:30 yesterday afternoon to welcome Labor and others.</p>
<p>US Reporter Group Participates in Inspection</p>
<p>The US reporter group that recently arrived in Shanghai, including Weishunai of the New York Times, Kleinai of the New York Free Forum, Clark of the Chicago Tribune, McKenorton of Time Magazine, and Hanley of the International News Service, hosted reporters from this city at the Construction Building on the eighth floor at 4:00 PM yesterday. Hutyat of Columbia Broadcasting Corporation did not attend, and Dillon of the United Press flew to Chongqing for a trip. They said that their mission was entrusted by the US Army and Navy authorities to inspect the surplus materials in various regions of the Pacific in order to report. The trip will last for a total of three weeks. This trip has no connection with the arrival of Undersecretary of the Army Labor and others. They also said that there are actually not many surplus materials in the Chinese region, but it is a good market for selling surplus materials in the Pacific. The US has already sold US$8.7 million worth of surplus materials to China. There are many US military surplus materials on the island of Okinawa, and efforts will be made to transport them to China for sale. The reporter group is scheduled to leave here for Manila on the morning of the 16th.</p>

<h3>The "Base Salary" of the City's Mayor is 800 Yuan Per Month: A List of Salary Levels for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The salaries of civil servants were previously adjusted by the Executive Yuan, with a base salary multiplied by 130, plus a living allowance of 40,000 yuan, but this official document has not yet been approved. According to speculation from relevant parties, it may be changed again. Currently, the salaries of municipal government employees are still calculated based on a base salary multiplied by 100, plus a living allowance of 30,000 yuan. The salary levels are listed below:</p>
<p>Specially Appointed</p>
<p>Mayor: The base salary is 800 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Senior</p>
<p>Level 1 (such as bureau chiefs and department heads with the same status as each bureau): The monthly salary is 680 yuan. The senior level is divided into eight levels, ranging from 430 yuan to 680 yuan, with a difference of 30 yuan between each level.</p>
<p>Recommended</p>
<p>Divided into twelve levels, ranging from 180 yuan to 400 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. The highest level for section chiefs is Level 1 recommended.</p>
<p>Entrusted</p>
<p>(Below section member) Divided into sixteen levels, ranging from 140 yuan to 200 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. From 110 yuan to 140 yuan, the difference is 10 yuan between each level. From 55 yuan to 100 yuan, the difference is 5 yuan between each level. Senior section members belong to the recommended level. Section chiefs and above are given an additional office allowance of 1,500 yuan to 8,000 yuan per month. There is also an entertainment expense, which is determined based on each person's duties. The salaries of workers range from 30 yuan to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, for municipal government affiliated agencies (such as hospitals belonging to the Health Bureau), the highest senior level is 520 yuan, starting from 430 yuan, with a difference of 30 yuan per level. The recommended level ranges from 220 yuan to 400 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. The entrusted level ranges from 110 yuan to 200 yuan, with 20 yuan per level.

<h3>Torrential Rain, Forming Lines for Petitioning: Labor Disputes in Hotels and Water/Wood Industries Resolved; Hotel Tea Servers' Wages Increased by 60%; Water/Wood Workers Decide to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After two rounds of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the hotel labor dispute has been resolved, and 15,000 tea servers will resume work at 1:00 PM. The reconciliation record will be signed at 10:00 AM today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Waiting in the Rain, Finally Resolved</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, more than 8,000 hotel workers, holding high banners inscribed with "Hotel Industry Workers' Union," marched to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding a 70% increase in wages based on their original salaries. To show their sincerity, all workers did not use umbrellas, standing in the torrential rain without flinching. However, the employers believed that not every hotel's room rates had increased by 70%, so wages could not be increased uniformly. Later, Director Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau persuaded them, promising that the labor representatives' wages could be increased by 60%, and the issue of hotel room rates would be discussed again in the afternoon. All the tea servers were satisfied, so they resumed work in the afternoon. However, when discussing room rates at 4:00 PM, another change occurred. The police department representative believed that the wage increase was too high, and room rates would inevitably rise accordingly, placing too much burden on travelers. Therefore, the 60% increase was bound to be overturned again. But the labor side unanimously opposed it. After several discussions and debates, Director Gu finally resolved the issue, maintaining the original agreement of a 60% wage increase for tea servers, and allowing a 50% increase in hotel room rates. The mediation record will be signed at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<p>The Bureau Decides on Temporary Measures</p>
<p>[Our Report] The labor dispute in the water/wood industry has lasted for nearly a week. Because most workers have no food for the next day and rely on their daily wages to maintain their family's livelihood, they could not afford further delays. 100,000 workers in the city urgently sought a solution, and there were daily parades and petitions. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, thousands of workers, after waiting a long time for news of the five representatives attending negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau, formed a line and rushed to the Social Affairs Bureau again. At that time, the rain was heavy, and the central square of the Social Affairs Bureau quickly became a sea of umbrellas. The workers demanded that the Social Affairs Bureau resolve the issue immediately, but the four employer representatives believed that wages had already been adjusted (2,600 yuan per day), so the labor's demand of 6,300 yuan was difficult to accept. Moreover, there were many businesses in the industry, and they dared not agree hastily, maintaining a very firm attitude. The Social Affairs Bureau, seeing the seriousness of the situation and the workers' tense emotions, fearing changes would occur, took temporary measures. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the workers to fully resume work starting today, and at the same time ordered the employers to pay a daily wage of 4,500 yuan before a formal resolution, with adjustments made after a formal decision. Both labor and management happily accepted this temporary solution, and the workers dispersed around 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works hired workers to repair roads and bridges, actively engaging in construction work. The water/wood industry union interfered and obstructed workers who had not joined the union from joining. After receiving a report, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau sternly warned the union yesterday, stating that it must not interfere with or obstruct workers who have not joined the union, and must not take illegal actions against government personnel, otherwise, it will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Workers at the Waterworks Petition</p>
<p>A dozen foremen from the Yangshupu Waterworks went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request mediation. When the Pacific War first broke out, the manager of the plant agreed with the workers that the workers would not leave their posts during the war, and the employers promised to pay each person a bonus of three months' salary after the war. However, after the victory, the employers suddenly went back on their word and did not fulfill their promise, so they requested the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in urging the employers to pay.</p>
<p>The Book Industry Employees Express Unconcern</p>
<p>The work slowdown at the Commercial Press has lasted for a long time without a resolution, causing unrest among employees of other bookstores such as Chung Hwa and World. They have jointly submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, urging a quick resolution, otherwise, other businesses fear they will be affected.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicles in the City Allowed to Increase Speed; Pedestrians and Drivers Must Be Careful</h3>
<p>[United Press] According to an announcement issued today by the China Theater Command: The command will begin a "Driving Safety" publicity program on the American military's Great American Radio Station, in order to reduce traffic accidents in the city. The Great American Radio Station will broadcast various programs daily to urge pedestrians and drivers to be especially careful, as all military vehicles are now authorized to drive at a speed of 18 miles per hour. It is said that the speed limit for American military vehicles was previously set at 13 miles per hour, but due to structural reasons, the above speed easily damaged the vehicles. In order to alleviate this difficulty, the municipal government has agreed to change the speed limit to 18 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Hai Zhou Ship Sails to Taiwan on Monday</p>
<p>[Our Report] In order to accelerate transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched the Hai Xiang ship, which was later reassigned to Qingdao, and then dispatched the Hai Yu and Hai Zhou ships to join the route. The Hai Yu is scheduled to set sail tomorrow, and the Hai Zhou is scheduled to sail to Taiwan on the 18th. As for the He Bei ship, it is currently unloading cargo, and the sailing date is undetermined. It is heard that the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, after negotiating with the company, has purchased tickets for the Hai Xiang and He Bei ships, and the staff members can transfer to the Hai Zhou ship to go to Taiwan without having to exchange tickets.</p>
<h3>Deed Tax and Land Tax to be Transferred to Special Collection; Inheritance Tax Difficult to Collect</h3>
<p>The deed tax and land tax currently collected by the Municipal Bureau of Finance will be transferred to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau for collection in the near future. The director of the bureau, Sun Zhaoxuan, will be transferred to the Jiangsu Direct Tax Bureau to replace Shi Shouchang. Shi is scheduled to take over next week. In addition, the collection of inheritance tax is extremely difficult because the household survey in the city has not yet been completed, and the registration of citizens' property has not been carried out. Therefore, the Direct Tax Bureau cannot investigate the deaths of citizens and their inheritance. Since its establishment, the collection of inheritance tax has not been developed, and the amount is very small.</p>
<h3>Increased Telephone Deposit: 7,500 Yuan Per Line</h3>
<p>The American Shanghai Telephone Company will increase the telephone deposit for all users in March and April. The deposit is 7,500 yuan per line. To reduce the burden on users, it will be collected in two installments, 3,750 yuan each in March and April. The amount will be included in the regular monthly bill to save procedures. Users can save the receipt for future refund applications.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Remuneration for Judicial Personnel: The Ministry Decides to Find Ways to Improve; Salaries of the Two Courts Paid According to New Standards</h3>

<h3>The Name of the Killed Fish Vendor Was Mistakenly Reported</h3>
<p>(Correction) Yesterday's report in this newspaper about the tragic death of a fish vendor who was killed by thieves stated that the deceased had no name, and Jiang Dingou was a doctor at Renji Hospital. The fish vendor was shot in the right front chest, and the bullet penetrated the heart and did not come out, so he died when he was sent to the hospital. The surname could not be obtained. The duty doctor, Jiang, signed a form to prove the death, which was mistakenly reported as the name of the fish vendor.</p>

<h3>Gold Buyers Hesitate, Rationing Surprisingly Effective, Exchange Rate Still Not Moving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to decline. The Central Bank of China (CBC) sold 175 gold bars at a price of 1.6 million, and some peers even refused to accept it. Moreover, this price remained valid for the day, closing the door to any further increase. Buyers hesitated and the market was very quiet. Opening flat in the morning at 1.63 million, the supply kept coming, and the price retreated to the range of 1.6 million. After 10:00 AM, it was still struggling below 1.59 million. The industry was hesitant about the registered rationing, and very few people registered. The CBC set a price slightly higher than the market price, stating that those who needed it could reserve it until this afternoon, otherwise, they would listen to them. Therefore, it was suppressed by the supply side, and buyers had no interest and just watched. At noon, it had fallen slightly to around 1.55 million. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon, hovering around 1.57 million. There were not many transactions, and the final result was about 60,000 lower than the previous day. Silver jewelry was listed at 170,000 yuan, standard silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were slightly lower and sold at 900 yuan. The underground exchange rate eased, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5 to 2 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were also sluggish. The US dollar followed the gold price down, starting at 2,050 yuan in the morning, but it was difficult to see any signs of recovery. At noon, it was approaching the 2,000 yuan mark before stabilizing slightly. The afternoon was the same, and the result was a further decline of 20 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also softened yesterday due to unfavorable conditions. The supply of Hong Kong telegrams turned abundant, and old tickets also carried a small 5 yuan, while new goods were flat. The CBC did not change the exchange rate. Hong Kong dollars were 420 yuan to 435 yuan, and rupees were 520 yuan to 540 yuan, and supply and demand gradually reached equilibrium.</p>
<p>Statistics on the Central Bank of China's Sale of Gold Bars</p>
<p>From last Thursday to yesterday, the Central Bank of China (CBC) sold a total of 2,283 gold bars at a highest price of 1.75 million yuan and a lowest price of 1.65 million yuan, shrinking the currency circulation by as much as 458.85 million yuan. The sales target was 63 gold and silver shops that are members of the Gold Industry Association. If gold is needed, the application for the purchase amount must be filled out with the Central Bank of China every day at 10:00 AM, and the payment must be made before noon after the Central Bank of China has approved it, to avoid speculation in the market. For example, yesterday, the Central Bank of China applied for 175 bars at a price of 1.6 million yuan. Seeing that the market absorption was very weak and there were people selling, there was a request to cancel the purchase. The gold market also became more and more sluggish. The price in the morning fell from 1.63 million yuan to 1.5 million yuan, and then recovered slightly by 450,000 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Unpopular Small Stocks Are Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Also Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Government bonds initially stabilized and then weakened. After the industry bulls raised prices, they all emerged, so C bonds declined from the 20 yuan mark in the morning to within 1800 yuan at noon. As a result, miscellaneous brands did not rise or fall much, and C bonds fell back by 50 yuan. Chinese stocks hovered at their peaks, which is a normal phenomenon after consecutive days of gains. Large investors supplied more than demanded, and some people switched from hot stocks to the second hottest and small stocks. At the same time, small stocks such as Xinguang worked hard on their own and had a great potential to catch up. Yongsha opened at 4,000 yuan in the morning, Meiya at 3,000, and Jingfu at 200 yuan. After opening, they once fell back by 50%. Xinguang gradually advanced from 170 yuan, and Qinxing got a lot of help from it. After the floating capital abandoned gold and banknotes, there was no way out, and they soon returned again. Yongsha Meiya was able to restore its former glory. At noon, large stocks stabilized, and small stocks were still popular. Jingfu saw 215 yuan, Xinguang 200 yuan, and Qinxing 160 yuan before slightly calming down. The noon closing result was that large stocks were flat compared with the previous day, Jingfu rose by 7 yuan, Xinguang rose by 20 yuan alone, and Qinxing was the same. Unpopular small stocks are gradually being favored by people. In the afternoon, hot spot transactions were higher for the next day, and foreign stocks were affected by the softening of gold prices. Holders sold goods to lock in profits. The opening in the morning was flat, but it was difficult to sustain it. The noon closing was earlier than Chinese stocks, and the market was flat and weak. Compared with the previous closing, Yisha British United fell back a little due to being popular, and the other stocks were not much different.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Gradually Return to Normal, Textile and Construction Groups Bid</h3>
<p>The yarn market yesterday still showed no sign of improvement. There were people supplying 20-count spot chips, but there were not many customers who needed them. In addition, the gold price fell again, so the prices of all yarn lines fell by another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The decline in 16-count Guangming was slower, only falling by 30,000 yuan. At noon, the Textile and Construction Company listed and tendered sales, from 1-count to 60-count, with a total of more than 20 types. It is heard that people in the industry are thinking calmly, so the buyers were not as enthusiastic as in the past. In addition, the Textile and Construction Company used a bidding method to recruit for two groups of 6-count and 10-count coarse yarn and 16-count and 20-count yarn for bidding. The bidding opened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The first group was won by the Gonghe Cotton Weaving Factory. Five companies bid for the second group, but none of them reached the company's minimum price, so there was no winner. This is also a new development in the yarn industry's buying and selling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton futures market reported a price increase of 18 points per pound, for a total of US$27.15. Long-term futures did not move, for a total of 26.55. Middling spot was 27.31. The local cotton transactions were reduced, because the gold and yarn prices continued to fall, and the Textile and Construction Company was hesitant and did not purchase. Only private yarn factories such as Shenxin Yarn Factory purchased a little, and the price was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was affected by the rain, and the local customers were very few, and the trend was extremely mediocre.</p>
<h3>Spinning Interest is Good, More and More Resumptions of Work</h3>
<p>There are currently 53 Chinese yarn factories in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, with a total of 1.7 million spindles, 100,000 thread spindles, and 15,000 looms. Recently, the number of spindles that have been restarted has exceeded half, accounting for 55%, and the number of thread spindles accounts for 46%, but only 26% of the looms have been started. Most of the factories are in Shanghai, accounting for 35 factories, and the remaining 16 factories are in Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Taicang, Jiading, Nantong, Chongming, and Haimen in Jiangsu Province, and only one factory each in Hangzhou and Wuhu in Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. Among them, Shenxin No. 9 Factory has the most resumed yarn spindles, with 66,000 spindles. Hongzhang Factory has the most resumed thread spindles, with 9,600 spindles. Hongzhang also has the most looms resumed, with 594 looms. Comparing today's yarn price with the flower price, the difference is very large. If each piece of cotton yarn uses 360 catties of cotton, calculated according to the market price of cotton at 90,000 yuan per picul, plus processing costs, the cost of each piece of cotton yarn is less than 500,000 yuan. Recently, the market price of cotton yarn has been around 1 million yuan, which is enough to stimulate production, and it is expected that it will be fully resumed in the short term.</p>
<h3>2,000 Tons of American Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The Samwater, managed by Tiansheng Yangxing, arrived in Shanghai from New York yesterday, carrying 2,000 tons of cotton, a total of 8,000 bales, and unloaded it at Floating Pier 1617. The cotton was purchased by the American An Yangxing, and the ship was specially loaded with this cotton to China.</p>
<p>More than 32,000 bags of flour, more than 2,000 boxes of tea, and more than 3,200 pieces of native paper were loaded on the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship and shipped to Qingdao today. Among them, more than 11,000 bags of flour were relief supplies, and the rest were commodities.</p>
<h3>Rice Rises Again</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday tended to rise again due to the overcast and rainy weather. Japonica rice increased by 500 to 600 yuan, and indica rice was scarce, increasing by nearly 1,000 yuan. White yuan was rare and precious, and rose sharply. There was no formal market price. Flour showed a slightly weak trend, and soybeans also had few transactions. High-priced goods fell slightly by 500 to 600 yuan, and soybean cakes were still weak and light, falling again by a small 200 to 300 yuan. Shantou's appetite was still weak, and there were many crude oil goods, and it was unable to rise. It was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Soybean oil goods were scarce and firm, and raw kernels were set. Wheat bran also seemed to be.</p>
<h3>World Wheat Production Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 14th] According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agriculture Group: World wheat production in 1945 was 5,200,000,000 bushels, the smallest production since 1929, a decrease of 8% compared to 1944. The sharp drop in production was due to the general decline in production in all regions except North America and Asia. Although wheat production in North America and Asia was smaller than a year ago, it was above the standard. The place with the smallest production was in Europe, where the production in 1945 was only 1,035,000,000 bushels, a decrease of 36% compared to pre-war levels.</p>
<h3>Tea Stagnation, Prices Weak</h3>
<p>In recent tea market conditions, buyers have adopted an attitude of selectively purchasing red and green tea varieties, so transactions have been weak and unable to rise for days. In terms of price, some profit-taking owners have competed to loosen their holds, and although prices once fell, the market atmosphere has continued to feel weak, and there are fears that the future may still soften.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Thin Tinplate</h3>
<p>35-pound thin iron has always been regarded as a noble product in tinplate, but cigarette factories, monosodium glutamate factories, and pigment shops use more of it, and others only need it sporadically. The stock on the market is very shallow. Unexpectedly, recently, shoelace factories suddenly purchased several boxes, so the underlying goods in the market have tightened. It is difficult to ship overseas orders to Shanghai for a while, so those who have spot goods must wait for a good price to sell. Yesterday, single-linked products were offered at 500,000 yuan per box, and double-linked products with more sheets were sold at 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rising Wind of Fuel Gradually Subsided</h3>
<p>The coal market is gradually stabilizing, and there are no rises or falls in any goods. Market transactions have also declined a lot due to the rain. Even the popular white coal sieving blocks have few transactions. Only white coal juveniles and firewood charcoal have sporadic embellishments. There is a lot of anthracite coal slag flowing out from all parties. It is rumored that the production factories will have low-priced allocation news, which has led to a sluggish way out. However, in terms of selling prices, sellers are still trying to support it and are unwilling to sell it cheaply, and are still standing on the original plate.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The stock of industrial raw materials in the city is weak, so prices have risen sharply, especially caustic soda, bleaching essence, and red alum for tanning leather, etc., which are almost scarce due to their vast uses. It is heard that a batch of goods ordered from Calcutta recently has arrived in Shanghai, including caustic soda, pure alkali, bleaching powder essence, red alum, etc. from the Bu Neimen brand, so the market price of the above has been slightly weakened. However, according to actual needs, it is still insufficient.</p>
<h3>China Establishes Import Committee in New York</h3>
<p>[New York News Agency, 13th] The Chinese government will establish a temporary Import Design Committee in New York, under the Supreme Economic Council, chaired by Dr. T.V. Soong. The committee's main task will be to determine the necessary import goods during the reconstruction period and to select the best sources of supply.</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>Bricks, Tiles, and Lime: Although carpenters and masons have been on strike for days, market prices are still rising, due to continuous rain, poor production in the interior, and extremely limited supply sources.</p>
<p>Foreign Paper: Prices have been falling for days due to the arrival of numerous foreign shipping notifications. The supply of sugar is uninterrupted, and both buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, with no transactions taking place at any stall.

<p>Cotton Products: 3901 and 901 Goose Brand undershirts are slightly higher by two to three thousand yuan. Xinhua 42 interlock shirts have also risen in price due to rumors of higher factory quotations.</p>

American Beauty quilt covers remain at their original price. Great Prosperity quilt covers continue to drop by 20,000 yuan. Electricity-spun and foreign-spun fabrics have also fallen by three to four thousand yuan due to factory supply. Other items are down by one hundred to one hundred and fifty yuan.</p>

<h3>Dr. Y.C. James Yen Advocates Literacy Campaign</h3>
<p>Expresses Opinions to Reporters in the United States</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 13th] Dr. Y.C. James Yen, a famous Chinese educator, met with reporters at the home of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas yesterday to discuss his work in promoting the mass literacy campaign in China. Dr. Yen pointed out that three hundred million Chinese people, or three-quarters of China's total population, have never received any formal education in the past.</p>
<p>Eliminate Illiteracy Completely Within the Next Ten Years</p>
<p>He said that to date, sixty million people have been educated and are now literate. He also stated, "We hope to completely eliminate illiteracy within the next ten years." Dr. Yen declared that the resolutions passed by the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference in January of this year would greatly benefit China's education, economy, and social progress. The purpose of the Consultative Conference is to guide China towards democracy. However, if the general public is impoverished and lacks literacy, then how can democracy be realized? If we want the people to live a reasonable life under a democratic system, then the primary goal of mass education must be to achieve it. Dr. Yen mentioned his meeting with President Truman at the White House on March 11, stating that the President was already somewhat aware of the Chinese mass education movement, but wished to know more details.</p>
<p>American Experts Come to China to Assist in the Implementation of Mass Education</p>
<p>Dr. Yen said that two years ago, he came to the United States on behalf of the Chinese government as a member of the Post-War Research Committee. He has recently begun to find ways to solve the problem of obtaining technical assistance from American agricultural and medical experts, who will soon go to China to assist in the implementation of the mass education movement. Although the specific methods have not yet been determined, he hopes that the experts will be able to travel. This Chinese educator stated that he hopes China can send a large number of young people to the United States for further study. Dr. Yen said that in medicine, public health, and agriculture, in particular, the United States has many technologies that can be applied to China, but the situation is slightly different in education, because the educational problems of the two countries are very different. Dr. Yen said that he personally plans to return to China within a month to continue his work in promoting the literacy campaign.</p>

<h3>Dr. Joseph Needham Lectures on Sino-British Scientific Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Professor Joseph Needham lectured at the Sino-British Cultural Association at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month, stating: "In China, due to the difficult environment during the war, the situation when the British Council began its work was very special. In 1942, Britain sent Professor Dodds of Oxford University and the renowned scientist Dr. Joseph Needham to Free China to establish contact with universities and vocational schools. China's difficult environment left Chinese scientists isolated. Therefore, Dr. Needham, based on his past experience in Britain and the United States, established a Sino-British Science Co-operation Office in China. Initially, the office was financially supported by the British Council, but in fact, it was connected to the British Ministry of War Production and several British and American scientific societies. Now that the wartime work has ended, the two countries should continue to exchange cultures as much as possible in the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit within the broader organization of the British Council."</p>

<h3>Our Country Participating in Davis Cup Committee Established in England</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Our country's committee for participating in the Davis Cup tennis competition has been formed in London. The committee is composed of thirty units, including our country's government agencies, overseas Chinese civilians, and private groups.</p>
<h3>Sports Briefs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Physical Education Teachers' Research Association, since its establishment at the end of last semester, has been holding meetings during its spare time. It is learned that a meeting will be held next Sunday at Gezhi Public School to convene all members to jointly discuss the way forward.</p>
<h3>The National College of Commerce About to Relocate to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Fang Jingyao</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, there were many emerging and famous universities in the interior, and the National College of Commerce was one of them.</p>
<p>Those in charge of this college are Zhao Dihua, Hou Houpei, Cheng Ruilin, Zhang Boqin, Wu Gan and other economic figures. The scale of the College of Commerce is quite large: in the university department, it is divided into four departments: banking, accounting statistics, industrial and commercial management, and land economics, and is currently located in Qiancheng Suoli, Hunan. The branch department has two specialized courses in statistics, politics, and cooperation, which are located in Yuanling, Hunan.</p>
<p>The university department with four departments is a four-year system with a total of sixteen classes, and the branch department with two specialized courses is a two-year system with a total of four classes. There are more than 700 male and female students and nearly 50 professors, many of whom are scholars with excellent academic experience.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of materials and finances during the Anti-Japanese War, the school buildings and equipment of the College of Commerce were inevitably dilapidated like those of other universities. However, the spirit of those in charge of persevering and striving to expand is admirable. Therefore, the graduates of each session have excellent results and mostly serve in government agencies and well-known banks in the interior.</p>
<p>Now that the resistance has been won, universities across the country are preparing to return, and the College of Commerce is no exception. It has requested instructions from the Ministry of Education to relocate east on a specific date. It is said that the students who will graduate this year will take the graduation examination in mid-April this year, and the school will begin to relocate in May. The school address is approximately near Jiangwan in Shanghai. Alumni in the Shanghai area are very excited about this good news and are now unanimously busy preparing to welcome the returning staff. I think that if this National College of Commerce can be run seriously in Shanghai, one of the world's six largest cities, it will definitely cultivate many outstanding financial talents.</p>

<h3>Incidental Notes from Accompanying Marshal on Inspection (II): The Mysterious Aura of Yan'an Fades in the Torrent of Peace</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, Dated the 11th: Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM on the 4th, Marshal's C40 silver aircraft, along with the green dragonfly-like C40 giants carrying news reporters and team members, hastily bid farewell to  and flew southwest toward a completely different place—Yan'an. Looking out of the square-foot window, the sky was gloomy. The long, wide iron body of the C40 flew close to the dense, plum blossom-like clouds, like a broken plank floating on turbulent ocean waves. I had originally hoped to survey the Ikezhao League desert, where I had wandered last year on this day, from the air, but the boundless, impenetrable cloud layer blocked my view. Oh well! I went to sleep. I don't know how long I slept, but the noisy voices and stomping footsteps in the cabin woke me up. It turned out that we had already reached the airspace above Yan'an. Everyone was excited about this extremely mysterious place. Looking out the window, beneath the aircraft's wings was a range of jagged peaks. At this time, although the aircraft was gradually descending steeply among the mountains, everyone stared, wondering, "How can we land? There are mountains everywhere!" But the clever and steady pilot finally brought us to a palm-sized, small flat nestled among the mountains. When the wheels of the aircraft gently kissed the earth at 4:30, everyone exclaimed in unison, "OK!" This road to Yan'an, like China's road to peace, is: "When mountains and rivers end, one doubts there is no road, but then willow trees and bright flowers reveal another village!"</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai, Despite Illness, Arrives at the Scene</p>
<p>Today, our green dragonfly actually arrived first. Stepping off the plane onto the soft soil after the initial thaw of ice and snow, we busily shook hands with a crowd of people whose identities were indistinguishable from their clothing. Among them was a tall man with a round, brownish face, wearing a dark coffee-colored, rough woolen uniform and a duckbill cap, looking just like a foreman in a city factory. After the handshake, Jin Yanchang from the reception office rushed over to introduce him, and we learned that he was the famous Mr. Mao Zedong. On this day, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Lin Zuhan, Mao's wife Jiang Qing (i.e., Lan Ping), Zhu's wife Kang Wuqing, labor hero Wu Manyou, and others all came to the airport to welcome us. General Zhu De was wearing a worn-out, grass-green, coarse woolen military uniform and a gray cotton coat with a black sheepskin collar. In Shanghai, he would definitely be mistaken for a "cook." Although he was over sixty years old, he was still as strong as a bear. Peng Dehuai, despite his illness, arrived at the scene. He appeared older and more gaunt than when I saw him in Luoyang in 1929. Lin Zuhan arrived in Yan'an's only black car, wearing a strangely large navy blue woolen duckbill cap. On the high slopes around the airport, various groups of welcoming crowds supported red banner slogans and waved paper flags. The Yan'an city street self-defense force even carried eye-catching red-tasseled spears to welcome Marshal Marshall, the Allied Chief of Staff who used atomic bombs in warfare. It is said that from noon onwards, over three thousand people from all walks of life in Yan'an formed a welcoming line and successively entered the airport, having waited for four and a half hours.</p>
<p>Jeep Enters Yan River City</p>
<p>In an instant, Marshal's C54 silver aircraft also gracefully landed. Getting off the plane, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries, and taking photos. At this time, applause thundered throughout the field. Slogans welcoming the three generals, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou, and "Support the Political Consultative Conference's decision on military reorganization" rose and fell. Marshal Marshall inspected the honor guard and sat in a car. As he passed through the decorated archway with the Chinese and American flags hanging high, the cheers of the crowd completely drowned out the sound of the car. Although many in the crowd were wearing uniforms, even those who weren't were inevitably "ordered to welcome," but seeing those simple faces full of hope and excitement, I still believe that most of them were sincerely cheering for Marshall, the giant of peace. People without political ambitions have no animosity toward "peace" forever.</p>
<p>The American military jeep took us from the airport to the reception office on the hillside outside the south gate of Yan'an. After staying there for a while, our group went out to stroll the streets. Yan'an is a pocket-sized mountain city that leans against the hillside on one side and faces the Yan River on the other. A bombing raid by enemy aircraft in 1927 reduced the entire city to ruins. Eight years later, the city of Yan'an is still a scene of dilapidated houses and crumbling walls. Only a cold and desolate dirt road has been opened up in the middle of the city, with two large locust trees remaining beside it. Otherwise, there is nothing. All the agencies, audit offices, and schools have completely moved out of the city to the hillside or to the cave dwellings opened in the cliffs of the valley. In recent years, the center of military and political affairs has almost entirely concentrated outside the city. Mao Zedong lives in the Qiu Garden, which is extremely far away, and rarely comes out. The CCP Central Committee Office is located in Yangjialing, across the Yan River north of the city. Zhu De lives in Wangjiaping, which is closest to the city. Marshal Marshall and General Zhang Zhizhong are staying at his deputy's headquarters. Among the more important agencies south of the city, only the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government remains. Most of the area south of the city is a commercial district. The streets are very narrow, with small shops selling groceries and fabrics on both sides. Xinhua Bookstore and the Border Region Bank are also embedded among these shops. According to the people who greeted us, these shops were originally small stalls. Because business has been quite profitable in recent years, they have built houses and shop fronts one after another, and soon formed a "street." In order to welcome Marshal Marshall and General Zhang Zhizhong, simple Yan'an has been dressed up. Red and green slogans are everywhere on the walls. The slogans welcoming General Zhang Zhizhong are no less frequent than those welcoming Marshal Marshall. In addition, there are slogans supporting Chairman Jiang. Every shop and agency hangs the national flag of the Republic of China. The flags don't look newly made—some are quite tattered, but it is conceivable that they are not usually hung often, because most of the flags are very fluttering and the colors are very bright.</p>
<p>The Yan River is narrow and shallow, neither beautiful nor magnificent. We can't believe that it is the Yan River praised by some young people? "Ah! You don't know, during the summer mountain floods, the Yan River becomes terrifyingly large, destroying many crops and drowning many people and livestock every year," the person who greeted us explained, telling us not to look down on the narrow and shallow river. I stood on the pebble-strewn bank of the Yan River, looking at the ruins of the old city of Yan'an that had been bombed by enemy aircraft, the primitive cave dwellings like beehives on the hillside cliffs, the barren land that only produces coarse grains, the simple people with earthy faces, and those CCP cadres whose intelligence and knowledge are not particularly remarkable. I couldn't help but think of a question: is it really this small city and its cadres that control such a vast area? What is the source of this small city's great power? This should be a serious question worthy of deep thought.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, we took a large truck, passed through the old city, crossed the Yan River, and arrived at the CCP Central Committee Office in Yangjialing for a banquet hosted by Mr. Mao Zedong. The Central Committee Office is the most beautiful Western-style building in Yan'an. The entire wall is built with stone formed from water. It has a large reception hall that can accommodate a hundred people for dancing and a large auditorium that can accommodate two or three thousand people for meetings. The banquet began at 7:30. Ten tables were set up in the reception hall, with exquisite Chinese-style dishes. Mr. Mao stood up and raised his glass to give a speech: "General Marshall and Generals Zhang and Zhou have worked hard to establish a new China of peace, democracy, unity, and unification. The people of the whole country should be grateful, and the CCP also expresses its gratitude. The Chinese Communist Party is now prepared to dedicate all its efforts to the cause of national construction. Long live Sino-American cooperation! Long live KMT-CCP cooperation! I wish President Truman, Chairman Chiang, General Marshall, General Zhang Zhizhong, General Zhou Enlai, and everyone good health!" Marshall's response was brief, simple, and enthusiastic: "I thank Chairman Mao for his hospitality. Please everyone, raise your glasses to the Chinese people!"</p>
<p>The Yan'an community's welcome party began in the Central Auditorium at 9 PM. Last year on this day, the CCP National Congress was held here. To this day, there is still a striking line of red characters on the front of the auditorium: "Advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong." General Zhu De's welcome speech on this day was optimistic from beginning to end, with only a thought-provoking section in the middle. That section was: "It is undeniable that there are still many obstacles and difficulties in the cause of peace, democracy, and unity in China. These obstacles and difficulties have prevented the armistice agreement from being implemented in some places to this day. The difficulties encountered by the Political Consultative Conference resolutions are even greater, so it is expected that the implementation of the military reorganization plan will certainly not be smooth sailing." In his elegant and sincere speech, Marshall also dropped a bomb, which was: "In the negotiations between the senior officials of the government and the CCP in Chongqing, I did not feel any difficulties at all. Now the difficulty lies with those young people who are responsible for the reception. They are high-spirited, and although such a reaction is normal, it should soon become a thing of the past." These words were the acute pain Marshall felt during this trip of over ten thousand li. Minister Zhang Zhizhong's speech was sincere and beautiful. He guaranteed that the government would implement the three agreements one hundred percent, and requested that China have twenty or thirty years of peaceful construction. Finally, he said, "I would also like to tell a joke. I just talked to Chairman Mao and Madame Mao, and in the future, when your Communist Party writes history, please don't forget that Zhang Zhizhong came to Yan'an three times!" His speech, which was both solemn and humorous, stirred up three rounds of applause from the audience. After Zhang's speech, the entertainment program began. Unexpectedly, Mr. Mao Zedong did not deliver a speech. He sat silently in the front row, to Marshall's right. Thus, the few words of blessing that Mao gave at the pre-dinner banquet became the only public statement we heard from Mao during our eighteen hours in Yan'an (including sleeping time).</p>
<p>Mao Zedong Arrives Latest</p>
<p>The next day, Marshal Marshall left Yan'an. Among the Yan'an Party, government, and military leaders who saw him off, Mao Zedong arrived the latest. He looked plump, but his spirit and complexion were not very good. It was probably true that he was just recovering from a long illness. In a hurry, a reporter asked Mao when he would go to Chongqing. "Minister Zhang also talked about this matter when he came," Mao said, "Whenever Chairman Chiang wants me to go, I can go." It is said that on the night before and that morning, Mao had talks with Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai, but they only exchanged their beliefs and understandings of Chinese and international issues and did not specifically discuss any problems. Officials revealed that Mao expressed considerable goodwill during the talks. When Marshal Marshall was about to board the plane, he shook hands with Mao and said, "Our meeting has historical significance." This historic meeting came to an end at 9:30 when the engines of the C54 silver aircraft roared and soared into the clear sky.</p>
<p>Before leaving Yan'an, at the airport, the reporter had a few minutes of conversation with General Zhu De. He reiterated the CCP's firm military reorganization plan. The reporter asked if there were any difficulties in implementing the military reorganization plan. He said, "A proper solution should be found for the surplus officers and soldiers." Lin Zuhan occasionally mentioned that middle and lower-ranking officers inevitably had doubts about the implementation of the military reorganization plan. The reporter asked General Zhu about this, but he did not admit that it was a fact.</p>
<p>Lin Zuhan is a key figure representing the "government" in Yan'an—he is the chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. The reporter asked him if the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government would be abolished in the future. He said that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government was approved by the Executive Yuan's meeting. Whether it will be abolished in the future depends on how the government decides in the future.</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai, who is ill (some say it is heart disease), does not seem to appear much in Yan'an. On the 4th, he also participated in the welcome party in the Central Auditorium despite his illness. He silently retreated into the crowd in the third row. There was no stove in the auditorium, and the cold air was bone-chilling. When he coughed, his young and gentle wife, Ms. Pu Anxiu (sister of New Citizen News reporter Pu Xixiu, a student at Fu Jen Catholic University), went to the chair in front and took off his overcoat. Ms. Pu was wearing an old velvet jacket, and was slender and beautiful, like a small bird. She said that she had arrived at the border region in 1938.</p>
<p>Chen Shaoyu Suffers from Both Heart and Stomach Ailments</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived at the reception office, our reporters submitted a list of people we hoped to see. This list included Chen Shaoyu and Wang Shiwei, the author of Wild Lily Flower. Two hours later, we saw Chen Shaoyu in the Central Committee Office. A short, fat man, wearing a gray cotton military uniform, covered with a gray overcoat with a leather collar, and a slightly tattered floral scarf, leaning on a cane, he said that he had been suffering from an enlarged heart and stomach problems in recent years, so he had been recuperating and had not been to Chongqing for five or six years. (In the past, he was the most active CCP figure in the Political Participation Council.) It is said that he has had several children in recent years. The reporter talked to him about Sino-Soviet relations and the Northeast problem. His views were exactly the same as those of the Xinhua Daily editorial, so I won't repeat them.</p>
<p>Xu Teli, with a head of silver hair and a venerable appearance, was pulled aside by Minister Zhang, who once presided over Hunan's affairs, for a conversation before Mao Zedong's dinner. We asked Elder Xu if he planned to return to Hunan. He said, "We'll see what happens."</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall Can't Help But Smile. The entertainment after the banquet on the 4th fully demonstrated how the CCP has abandoned some foreign stereotypes and foreign pastimes in recent years, and has not hesitated to stoop down to learn folk art forms from farmers in order to promote their political education. The "Welcome Marshal Marshall Song" was performed by two pairs of men and women dressed in peasant costumes, wearing waist drums, dancing, singing, and drumming. The lyrics included "The victory of the War of Resistance was achieved, and all parties have contributed," "The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are the two wings of China," "The National Government's Chairman Chiang is supported by the people of the whole country," "Marshal Marshall's prestige will be passed down for thousands of years, and his beautiful name will be marked forever in the history of peace." Hearing this, people couldn't help but smile. Marshall also applauded and laughed loudly after listening. There was also the "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" Yangge, which encouraged increased production. It is said to be the most successful Yangge in the border region. Although we felt it was simple and crude (Ye Jianying probably didn't feel interested either, and was snoring loudly under the stage while the Yangge was being performed), this political education work, which reuses old forms, has indeed linked the backward countryside with the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Reader Opinions: Shanghai Milk Industry Responds to School Milk Movement</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Your newspaper published Mr. Ni Zhangqi's essay, "A Most Important but Neglected Group," in the "Special Commentary" section last month. The commentary deeply considers the serious issue of nutrition, believing that current scholarships, grants, and free quotas held by society and school authorities are of significant help to this group of disadvantaged students in continuing their studies. However, if this group of disadvantaged students, despite receiving assistance from various sectors of society to continue their education, suffer from poor daily nutrition, leading to physical weakness and even premature death, then the work of society in this area would be in vain. Who can guarantee that among them are not future Einsteins, Sun Yat-sens, Pasteurs, or Darwins, and other great geniuses? Their premature death due to malnutrition is an incomparable loss to our nation and to all of humanity. The importance of the problem of malnutrition among the disadvantaged is truly as stated in the article: "It is like building a house on sand, without a solid foundation. Once a storm hits, even if they persevere, their own fighting spirit and the efforts, love, and hope of all sectors of society for them will all vanish like bubbles." It is accurate and heartbreaking, and who would not be moved by it?</p>
<p>A few days later, in a casual gathering of colleagues, several mentioned reading this article, expressing deep sympathy. Regarding the statement, "In the early days of the war, materials were cheap, and one yuan could buy dozens of eggs or several bottles of milk. Yet, even then, the diet of disadvantaged students lacked nourishing items," given the current soaring prices, they felt even more regretful.</p>
<p>Our association is a union of those engaged in the milk industry. At the same time, the nature of our business is deeply related to the health and nutrition of the nation. In the work of nation-building after the victory of the war, how we should leverage the characteristics of our business to shoulder important responsibilities is something that every business and every citizen should be aware of. Therefore, we have not forgotten the feelings of regret and unease evoked by reading the article, which made us more aware of the seriousness of the national health problem after the current cruel war, and also increased the responsibility that the milk industry should have towards society.</p>
<p>The impact of this article on our colleagues does not stop at sympathy, regret, and unease. In formal meetings and private conversations among colleagues, we have discussed several times how the Milk Industry Association should respond to this important article. Regrettably, we have not yet discussed a concrete plan. Amidst this reflection, we were pleased to read Mr. Chen Wanli's "Reader Opinion" in your newspaper on February 10, titled "Utilizing Surplus Milk." Mr. Chen, from the standpoint of a doctor, in addition to sympathizing with the plight described in the article, actively proposed concrete methods for implementation to society and the Milk Industry Association. Among the methods proposed by Dr. Chen, the most important is that society should follow the method of raising funds for scholarships and grants, donating a sum of money to be managed by a committee composed of enthusiastic individuals. At the same time, milk producers should set a price that only covers costs to provide milk free of charge to a portion of children in society who have been found to be malnourished by doctors and others who need milk. It should start with children from disadvantaged families, and local health and education authorities should establish institutions to be responsible for sending doctors to examine elementary school children as a basis for receiving free milk. Furthermore, the hygiene of the milk should be strictly managed to meet standards, and radio and film should be used to launch this health campaign.</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Wanli's article and the methods listed therein, we truly feel a sense of mutual understanding. Assuming that the widespread nutritional problems of disadvantaged students are valued by society and relevant municipal authorities, and that Mr. Chen's proposed methods are practical and feasible, all members of the milk industry will unhesitatingly contribute their most sincere cooperation to this important movement related to national health.</p>
<p>Fresh milk is recognized worldwide as the most ideal nutritional beverage for humans. This is true in peacetime, and even more so during wartime. According to 1944 statistics in the United States, there were a total of 27 million dairy cows, producing 122,057 million pounds of milk per day, with each person drinking about one pound of milk per day. In wartime Britain, milk was even more crucial for maintaining national health. Before the war, the average daily intake per person was half a pound, with children exceeding this amount. Almost all schools across the country joined the "Milk in Schools" Scheme. In this program, each child was required to receive milk at noon every day, paying one-third of the value, with the rest subsidized by the government. If the child's parents could not afford this, it would be paid from public funds. During the war, the government stipulated that every mother and child under the age of five could obtain one pound of fresh, pasteurized milk at half price, and it could be provided free of charge in special circumstances. Milk was listed as an important wartime food by the state, and the milk industry was strictly managed and protected by the government because of its close relationship with the development of children and the health of adults in the country.</p>
<p>The average daily milk consumption in Britain and the United States is around one pound per person, while in Shanghai, with a population of four to five million, only 30,000 pounds of milk are produced daily, meaning that only one pound of milk is available for every hundred people. Despite this, there is still a slight surplus of milk (this situation has only recently begun, and it is not very significant). In addition to Mr. Chen's point about people believing in the advertisements for tonics on the radio, there are many other factors worth discussing. Because the relevant aspects are numerous and complex, we hope to have the opportunity to discuss the future and crises of the milk industry with society in Chinese.</p>
<p>The intention of this letter is to express our enthusiastic support and response to the articles by Mr. Ni and Mr. Chen, and at the same time, to convey our attitude to society. Whether this paper-based call can be transformed into practical action, and whether it can become a reality that helps the nutritional problems of disadvantaged students, depends on whether the public and relevant authorities value this issue and are willing to advocate for it. Our association will "wait patiently for orders." We would also like to take this opportunity to report to society that our association recently intends to pilot the "Milk in Schools" movement. We believe that health is the foundation of nation-building, and that the work of national health movement is the foundation of any work. There are of course many methods for national health movement, and milk should be one of the important methods to achieve this goal. With this understanding, and in our own capacity, we should bravely take on this responsibility and work, and we earnestly hope that enlightened people in society and the municipal health and education authorities will give us valuable guidance and assistance. (Letter from the Shanghai Milk Industry Association, March 10)</p>
<h3>The Death of Zhang Xinfu</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's Changchun airmail dispatch on the 8th. New Reporter.</p>
<p>The news of Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Fushun Coal Mine Acceptance Committee, being killed in Fushun, has already appeared in this newspaper, but the details were not clear. Now, Luo Dayu, a standing commissioner of Liaoning Province, Lu Wenyu, a party affairs commissioner of Jilin Province, and Wang Anwen, a party affairs commissioner of Changchun City, have prepared a detailed report on the whole story of Zhang's martyrdom. From this, it can be known that Zhang's murder was a planned conspiracy, and that the Fushun Coal Mine had already been taken over by the Soviet side before Zhang arrived in Fushun, making it clear that the Soviet Union refused to accept the handover from our government. The Eighth Route Army in Fushun was just a puppet controlled by them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Fushun Coal Mine Acceptance Committee, set off from Changchun on January 7 with six attendants in a special train on the China Chang Railway. The Soviet side was accompanied by Major General Marie, the deputy director of the China Chang Railway. Marie's attitude was mild, saying that the Fushun Coal Mine belonged to China and would be successfully taken over. However, after the train arrived in Shenyang, Marie suddenly did not mention the acceptance matter, and said that the Fushun area was very dangerous and that he had to contact them first to prevent Zhang from going. On the 10th, Zhang Chouzhen, chairman of the Northeast Executive Committee, called Zhang, urging him to go to the acceptance, and said that Major General Marie had arrived in Fushun and had told him that everything was ready. Zhang was afraid of the Eighth Route Army and did not dare to go. On the 14th, Zhang received</p>
<p>Major General Marie</p>
<p>Notice, saying that the police sent officers and soldiers to prepare a special train to escort him to Fushun, guaranteeing safety, and the departure time was 1:30 noon. Zhang then led his attendants Xu Yuji, Liu Yuanchun, Niu Junzhang, Zhang Lide, Cheng, etc., five people, to the station on time. Major General Marie personally summoned Li Yuanmin, the second battalion commander of the Railway Guard Public Security Team, to the station and ordered him to send personnel to escort and protect. Therefore, the Railway Police Guard Public Security Team sent Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander of the second battalion, Shu Shiqing, the captain of the company, Bai Yonggang, a first-class police officer, and six railway policemen to Fushun. Zhang met with Major General Marie again at the station. Marie said that the development was rapid and that he had contacted the commander of the Soviet army stationed in Fushun and sent twenty Soviet soldiers to protect him. Zhang then returned to his special train to Fushun. Because the soldiers sent by Marie did not arrive for a long time, he sent someone to urge them, but they said that this team of soldiers might not come. Suddenly, two Soviet soldiers came to the train, saying that Major General Marie said that there were twenty Soviet soldiers waiting at the Fushun station and there was no need to worry. The road may not be peaceful, so do not stop the train and please start the train. When the train started, there were 25 people on the train, including Zhang and his attendants (15 people), and the driver and fireman (10 people), at 2:15 noon.</p>
<p>When the train traveled to Shenjingzi, forty miles east of Shenyang (this place is occupied by the Eighth Route Army), someone at the station waved a red flag to order the train to stop. Zhang remembered Major General Marie's words and ordered the train not to stop. The station immediately opened fire. Zhang ordered the train to speed up and not to fight back. The sound of gunfire from both sides became denser. Zhang and others lay down on the train. Fortunately, no one was injured. The train was shot at about 158 times. When the train was approaching the Daguantun station near Fushun, it was again ordered to stop by waving a flag, but it still did not stop.</p>
<p>The train stopped at the Fushun station.</p>
<p>There were no Soviet troops</p>
<p>Zhang ordered people to look for them, but there were 20 Soviet soldiers at Daguantun, so he notified them by telephone to come. The commander of the garrison in the Fushun area and the deputy director of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, Feng Ren, arrived (i.e., the Eighth Route Army). The deputy director wanted to step forward to arrest Zhang and others, but was stopped by the Soviet commander, who ordered Zhang and others to enter the car and drive to the Fushun Coal Mine Office.</p>
<p>After arriving, the Soviet commander suddenly said that he did not know about the takeover. Zhang explained, "I was sent by Zhang Jiajing, the director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and I have already talked to Major General Marie, and Major General Marie has also contacted your army." He asked the Soviet commander, "Since you say you don't know about the takeover of the coal mine, why did you send someone to the station to pick us up?" The Soviet commander replied, "Because I heard that there were two Soviet officers coming to Fushun on this train, so I went to pick them up. I have not heard that you are coming here. We don't know about the takeover of the coal mine and cannot talk about it now." Then Zhang and others were sent to the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine.</p>
<p>On the 15th, two Soviet officers led Sun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and the armed Public Security Team to enter and talk to the Zhang Committee in the living room downstairs. Sun said, "This is a liberated area. Without the order of our commander, no one is allowed to enter. You brought seven soldiers, which violated our laws and should be punished."</p>
<p>Method of punishment</p>
<p>: First, disarm the seven armed soldiers. Second, please withdraw from Fushun immediately. Zhang said that he came to take over the coal mine on the order of Zhang Jiajing, director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and the armed soldiers were also sent by Marie to escort him. Sun said, "Our commander is Governor Zhang Xuesi, and Zhang Jiajing cannot control him. We don't care about your takeover of the coal mine, we only punish you for bringing tigers into the liberated area." Zhang immediately refused. Seeing the tense situation, Niu Junzhang and others asked Zhang to express reconciliation to Sun and others, and agreed to hand over the guns tomorrow. Later, Zhang and Niu Junzhang went to the Fushun Soviet Military Command to ask for protection, and asked to speak to Marie, telling him that they were in a dangerous situation and asking him to find a way. Marie promised to arrive in Fushun early tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the same day, Zhang called the attendants who stayed in Shenyang from Fushun and told them: "Because I did not obtain the formal permission (referring to a written document) from the Soviet Military Command in Shenyang when I set off from the station, the Fushun Soviet army can only protect their lives until the time of the call. Although I requested to extend it for 24 hours so that I could ask for instructions from my superiors, I was never granted permission." The attendants staying in Shenyang contacted the mayor of Shenyang to negotiate with the Soviet army to rescue them. The Soviet army's attitude was ambiguous, and the negotiations made no progress.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, several members of the Public Security Team suddenly entered with machine guns and detained everyone in a room, saying they wanted to disarm them. The house was already surrounded by armed forces. Under this situation, they had to unload the guns and bullets and hand them over to the Public Security Team. After disarming, they went to various places to check. At this moment, Zhang returned from the outside and said when he saw them checking, "Okay, do as you please!" The Public Security Team found</p>
<p>a bag of documents</p>
<p>In the bag, Zhang stepped forward, pulled out a family letter from it and tore it to pieces. The Public Security Team was furious and scolded. After persuasion, they calmed down.</p>
<p>After the Public Security Team left, the crowd negotiated with Zhang on what to do. Zhang only said, "It's over, Marie didn't come. I went everywhere to find him, but no one would see me. I couldn't find Marie when I called Shenyang." He looked very anxious.</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, the commander of the Fushun Soviet army suddenly led Soviet soldiers and several members of the Public Security Team to say, "I'll send you back to Shenyang." Zhang and others immediately asked, "It's getting late, will there be any inconvenience on the road?" The Soviet commander replied, "It doesn't matter." Zhang asked him to be responsible. The Soviet commander laughed and said, "Why bother? You are all Chinese, so what does it matter?" Zhang's nerves had been greatly stimulated and his hands were trembling. When he was about to go out, the Soviet commander suddenly said, "Only technicians are allowed to leave. The seven armed men are not allowed to leave." Because Bai Yonggang, a first-class police officer, was not among the armed soldiers and was specially invited by Zhang, Zhang asked the Soviet commander, "Bai is not an ordinary soldier, but a special person and should be treated the same as the acceptance personnel." He pulled Bai out, but was pulled back by the Soviet commander. Zhang then said, "If the Soviet army does not let you return to Shenyang tomorrow, I will come to Fushun to pick you up the day after tomorrow." Then they took four cars to the station.</p>
<p>On the Shenyang side, on the evening of the 16th, they inquired with the Fushun station by telephone, and the answer was that Zhang and others had taken a Soviet military train back to Shenyang at around 8:30 in the afternoon. He personally witnessed the departure of the train that Zhang and others were on.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the report from the people's self-defense groups and residents of Fushun said that Zhang</p>
<p>Arrived in Fushun the next day</p>
<p>Wang Xinshan, under the protection of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, had taken over the coal mine. Wang Xinshan was the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine, and the director was Russian. Because the news of the central government's takeover had been announced in the newspapers long ago, the general public believed that Wang Xinshan was the acceptance committee appointed by the central government.</p>
<p>On the 25th, the Shenyang City Police Department received a report that Zhang and the other eight people were transported by the Fushun Soviet army to a location 20 miles outside the city by military train on the evening of the 16th and stabbed to death with bayonets!</p>
<p>On the 26th, Rong Haizhan, the representative of the Fushun People's Self-Defense Group, reported the process as follows:</p>
<p>At about 8:20 p.m. on February 16, the Soviet army used a military train to carry Zhang and his attendants Xu Yugu, Liu Yuanchun, Cheng, the translator Zhang Lide, and Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander of the railway police guard public security team, Shu Shiqing, the company commander, etc., and many Soviet military officers and soldiers and members of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, and departed for Shenyang. At about 9:00 p.m., they arrived at the Lishizhai station, the fifth station west of Fushun. The Soviet army forced them to get off the train, stripped off Zhang's clothes, and took them to the mass grave on the south mountain of the station and stabbed them to death. At that time, Zhang said with grief and indignation: "I escaped into the mainland after the September 18th Incident. I never thought that I would end up like this when I returned to my hometown. I am willing to accept this fate for the country and the nation!" Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander, fought naked with the Public Security Team and snatched a gun, but was stabbed to the ground. His body was found to have 16 stab wounds. At that time, nearby residents heard the cries,</p>
<p>Terrible to hear</p>
<p>Bai Yonggang and the six railway policemen who were left in the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine thought they were doomed to die. A Soviet soldier who had been guarding outside for the past two days suddenly came and said, "They are going to kill you now, run away! They have already killed them." Bai did not fully believe it and did not leave, but he was even more frightened. At 11:00 p.m., the director of the Public Security Bureau suddenly led several teams with their guns pointed at Bai and others, and escorted them to the Public Security Bureau, where they were guarded by the Public Security Team. Until midnight, the deputy director and seven or eight members of the Public Security Team came in again, apologized to Bai and others, and asked about the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine.</p>
<p>On the 17th, a man surnamed Zhang, who was in his forties and was guarding Bai and others, said to Bai and others, "Your dangerous period is over, and there is no danger to your lives now. Later, you may be sent back to Shenyang, sent to the mine, or join the training of the Eighth Route Army."</p>
<p>On the 18th, the sky cleared up, and two Soviet soldiers came and said to Bai and others, "I'll send you to the station." Bai and others did not know whether this trip would be good or bad, and their faces changed. The Soviet soldiers smiled and said, "Are you afraid? Were two of your policemen killed?" When Bai and others heard this, they were even more terrified, thinking that Zhang and others might have been killed. The Soviet soldiers sent Bai and others to Shenyang. After arriving at the Soviet army command in Daguantun, two Soviet officers interrogated Bai and others to see if they were members of the Kuomintang and showed them an official document sent by the Fushun Soviet army, which read: "Fifteen Kuomintang members came to Fushun to disturb the mine. Eight have been killed and seven have been captured." Bai and others defended that they were railway policemen and were sent to Fushun by Marie to guard the mine. They were finally sent to the Shenyang City Police Department and released.</p>
<h3>A Variety of Scenes Inside and Outside the Second Plenary Session</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Chongqing, Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>The plenary session venue is in the Army Hall, the main entrance faces the mighty Yangtze River. In the center of the Dragon Gate square, a large flagpole stands tall, with the Kuomintang flag fluttering atop, welcoming the wind. The square is adorned with evergreen trees, lush and lovely, adding to the majestic atmosphere in front of the gate.</p>
<p>Double rows of guards stand on either side of the gate, with police officers in white sleeves scattered among them, amidst a constant stream of cars of all colors driving in.</p>
<p>Cars with a green plum blossom pattern permit can drive straight into the main gate. Inside, a larger rectangular square reveals that the original two rows of car garages are no longer sufficient. All have been moved and arranged in three long rows, with fifteen vehicles in each row, creating a "sea of cars" with nearly a hundred colorful vehicles. The back door is the second parking lot, where cars of all colors are arranged in a vast expanse.</p>
<p>The main entrance of the venue has more than ten steps, and on the balcony above the door stand four small flagpoles, with Kuomintang flags waving in the wind.</p>
<p>In front of the gate, a red banner several feet long reads in bold characters: "Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<p>On either side of the highest step, two wooden signs are erected, stating: "Attendants, stop here."</p>
<p>On both sides of the venue's main entrance stands another solemn guard.</p>
<p>Outside the glass door corridor, a row of long tables is arranged. In the center is the signature table for the Executive Committee members, on the right is the signature table for the Supervisory Committee members, and on the left is the signature table for the press release group and conference staff. The tables are filled with conference printed materials. Every morning, the "Central Daily News" and "Peace Daily News" are available, and at noon, the Nanjing "Central Daily News" is delivered by air, available for attendees to read freely.</p>
<p>On the wall between the two doors hangs a seating chart for all committee members and attendees, along with the badges for Central Committee members, pink staff passes, white security personnel passes, yellow worker symbols, and car passes.</p>
<p>Pushing aside the green door curtain, a magnificent hall decorated with red, white, and blue colors appears before one's eyes, resembling a garden.</p>
<p>Fourteen square pillars, seven on each side, stand inside the hall. Each pillar is completely wrapped in red, white, and blue cloth, and a shield made of the national flag with five small Kuomintang flags inserted is nailed to each pillar.</p>
<p>A red banner with white characters displaying the full name of the conference hangs in front of the rostrum. At the center of the platform is a large national flag and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, with twenty-six small Kuomintang flags inserted in flag stands on either side. The tips of the steel spears sparkle. At the front of the platform, facing the audience, is a row of seats for the chairman and secretariat staff, with Western-style leather-backed chairs and desks piled high with documents and stationery. A row of camellias stands by the stage, and a row of wintersweet flowers below the stage, opening the purple curtains. The scenery is like a pile of brocade, colorful and dazzling under the mercury lights.</p>
<p>Below the platform, facing the audience, is the podium. There are 327 committee seats in the hall, with Supervisory Committee members on the left and Executive Committee members on the right. The chairs have wide armrests for writing, with blotting paper attached to the front and pencils attached to the back for immediate use.</p>
<p>The first seat for the Executive Committee members is written "President Chiang," and the last seat (No. 285) is "Zhang Jingyu." The first seat for the Police Committee members is written "Wu Jingheng," and the last seat (No. 142) is written "Liu Chengxu."</p>
<p>The current regiment commander and the heads of various ministries and commissions, the first row on the left is Chen Chuncai, Zhou Junyan, the center is Chiang Ching-kuo, the first row on the right is Zhang Huanlong, Yuan Ruchuan. Conference staff and the press release group sit around the long chairs against the wall.</p>
<p>The podium, secretariat seats in the conference hall, and the podium are equipped with broadcasting equipment. Large loudspeakers are installed in the corners of the conference hall, with sufficient power to broadcast even the coughs of the elderly Wu Zhihui.</p>
<p>The blue curtains on the surrounding glass windows are always tightly drawn, and guards are stationed around the windows, with strict arrangements.</p>
<p>The lights on the roof and corners are bright, and the carpet underfoot is as soft as ever. The camellias on the platform bloom in the sunny weather, and the hall is filled with more warm spring.</p>
<p>Large red and white banners with the slogans "Improve Party Affairs" and "Reform Politics" are hung inside the hall, striking and eye-catching.</p>
<p>The rest room for the conference presidium is in the Chief’s office, and the rest room for the Central Committee members is in the newly built three-story building on the right side of the conference hall. During breaks, snacks are provided, the buns are very large, and the biscuits are extremely abundant.</p>
<p>Since the 11th, all conference entry and exit permits have been changed. The staff's pink slips have been changed to light green, and the security personnel's white slips have been changed to purple. On each attendant's slip, the name of the committee member they are accompanying is clearly written, such as: "Chen Bulei Committee Member Attendant ×××". Whether the committee members are sitting in the rest room chatting or standing on the steps in front of the hall basking in the sun, they all hear the sound and enter the conference hall, resembling the "class starts" situation in a school.</p>
<p>When the meeting adjourns, the cars in the parking lot swirl around, and the sound of horns becomes a cacophony. Outside the main gate, on the side of the road, crowded citizens stand and watch the long snake of cars. (March 10)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Molière and Shakespeare: A Comedic Comparison</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>From the late 16th century to the first half of the 18th century, the theatrical form of "comedy" underwent significant development, occupying a critical place in the artistic realm of the time. This was due to the influence of the Italian Renaissance, which revived the comedies of ancient Greece and Rome in the minds of the writers of the time.</p>
<p>Molière and Shakespeare are the foremost representatives of comedic writers from that period. And their works displayed two opposing tendencies. Everyone knows that Molière achieved the highest acclaim in French comedy. His plays hold a permanent place in French literature. Shakespeare is an eternally revered playwright, practically known to every man, woman, and child. Molière's consistent style was to represent the realities of society, fully expressing the spirit and color of classicism. The material for his comedies was derived entirely from the actual social conditions of his time. In the depiction of characters, he comparatively neglected unique personalities, focusing instead on more general types. This is precisely the opposite of Shakespeare, who valued the effect of the story more than the effect of the character. Therefore, Shakespeare highly valued individual character portrayal, while Molière focused on the presentation of typical characters.</p>
<p>The characters in Molière's comedies are all figures from the realities of the society of his time, and his works reflected the overall social life of that era. Some say that the social history of the 17th and 18th centuries can be read from his works. He brought the "social function of comedy" to full expression. What he showed people in his works was mutual opposition and inevitable conflict. Although he exposed the dark side of the society of his time with his sharp pen, he actually explained the relationship between people and society, and the relationship between people and each other. He hoped that his audience would gain a clear understanding of society from watching his plays, and that this would arouse the idea of transforming society. Unlike Shakespeare, who loved to use beautiful endings, matching the effect of music to entertain the audience, he only wanted to evoke a laugh containing ideological components in the audience.</p>
<p>Thus, it is worth examining his own explanation of comedy: "To depict all ridiculous figures on the stage should not make anyone feel uneasy. Those figures are public mirrors, in which we should not pretend not to see ourselves." "Indeed,</p>
<p>to express great thoughts, to accuse fate, to question the deities, are all much easier than to reveal ridicule in an appropriate way, or to make human errors appear pleasant on the stage. When you portray those heroes, you can do whatever you want, as they are all imaginary figures, and we do not require any similarity on them." From these words, we can easily see his thoughts.</p>
<p>In Molière's plays, we rarely find ardent passion and abundant imagination, which is completely different from Shakespeare. Molière often uses reason more than emotion when dealing with plot, sometimes even abandoning emotion and only making general practical sense explanations. Reality, objectivity, calmness, and composure are the characteristics of his works. He produces his works by appealing to his reason and moderation, so extremes and exaggerations are rare. Unlike Shakespeare's comedies, which are woven from passion, he presents human weaknesses and mistakes through the expression of typical characters, intellectually. Naturally, only individual antagonistic views can be found here, and no intense and active scenes can be seen.</p>
<p>Each of Molière's comedies is a representation of general social reality. In the character portrayal, he especially emphasizes general social truths, never paying as much attention to the creation of unique characters as Shakespeare. He gives people social types, with no individuality at all. In Shakespeare's comedies, resistance from the individual against society expresses sympathy for the individual. He handled the characters standing in a position of being oppressed by society, and his goal was to awaken people to reform the unreasonable society. Although Molière's works express conflict between individuals and society, he absolutely does not sympathize with those individuals who resist society. He does not agree that people should transform established social forces, and people should accommodate society. For example, in his play "The Misanthrope," Alceste became ridiculous because he presumptuously wanted to transform society. He felt that the society at that time was too hypocritical, and added a very heavy attack. In Molière's view, Alceste was really ridiculous, because society was not wrong after all, and there was no room for criticism. Instead, Alceste himself was wrong.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Molière's comedies have immortal artistic value. It can be said to be philosophical rather than literary. As far as the "appeal to reason" is concerned, he and Roman comedies based on situations or tricks, and the satirical or realistic comedies represented by Jonson in England belong to the same category, while Shakespeare's "appeal to emotion" comedies and the sentimental comedies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are clearly another category.</p>
<h3>Must Write Purely</h3>
<p>— Wei Cong</p>
<p>Recently, many writers have advocated that articles should be written purely. Ai Wu, Zhan Yi, Duanmu Hongliang, Lu Fen and others have expressed their opinions on the formal expression of articles, and their conclusions are consistent: excellent articles must be records of excellent spoken language.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, vernacular Chinese has been popular in society for nearly thirty years. No one can deny the success of vernacular Chinese and its contribution to our country's culture and education. Whether from the point of view of popularizing education or promoting culture, vernacular Chinese does have its indelible value.</p>
<p>However, has colloquial language been successful in the literary revolution? No, we cannot say that it has been completely successful, only that it has been partially successful. As the late writer Zhang Tianyi said: "Until spoken language can fully approach pure spoken language, it cannot be considered completely successful." As the name implies, colloquial language must refer to articles written using the expressive methods of spoken language, and the unification of language and writing is a common trend in countries around the world. Language is for expressing thoughts, and articles are also for expressing thoughts. They each have their own uses, but the purpose is the same.</p>
<p>Many articles are written in a style that is neither classical nor vernacular, and the mixture is very awkward. The reaction given to readers is uncoordinated and unclean, and reading them is often unpleasant. Zhu Ziqing once strongly advocated in an article on writing methods: don't write colloquial language, otherwise you must write like spoken language, and words and characters that are not easy to say should be discarded from the article. Liu Bannong also pointed out a major path for writing: you must train your spoken language well in order to write good articles.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to quote a passage from Ye Shengtao: "Those who have received very shallow classical Chinese education, or have simply never received classical Chinese education, are fortunate people. They don't have to spend much thought or effort to free themselves from the old shackles. What is worrying is that they pick up a pair of old shackles and put them on their hands and feet—they also add a little classical Chinese words and phrases to the colloquial language." Ye's words are very insightful, and he strongly advocates that authors should grasp the principle of "writing purely." Yes, it is really a bit unreasonable for colloquial language to ask classical Chinese for rescuers again.</p>
<p>Most people who write articles now have received a very deep classical Chinese education. When they write colloquial language, they will unintentionally insert some classical Chinese set phrases, so sometimes it is impossible to completely avoid using a little classical Chinese words and phrases. Even those writers who advocate that articles should be written purely, their essays and novels, even if they exhaust their efforts, still cannot avoid using classical Chinese words and phrases, and still cannot avoid destroying the purity of colloquial language. Zhu Ziqing and Ye Shengtao are considered relatively successful. The articles they write are already close to spoken language, although it cannot be said that they are completely close. Pure colloquial language is really not easy to write. You must go through some training in writing skills in order to write fluently, cleanly, concisely, and vividly.</p>
<p>Some people say that if the article is written close to spoken language, isn't that "vulgar and detrimental to elegance"? This is an extremely incorrect traditional view. You must know that a good article must have rich emotions or unique thoughts. How can it be said to be "elegant" by simply using a few classical Chinese words and phrases that you think are very elegant in form to render it? Thought is a reflection of real life, and language and articles are both indispensable tools for expressing thought. Being able to express true thought, even if you write the most vulgar language, will not lose its value. The ancients even knew to say: "The greatest feelings are without embellishment." It can be seen that the most moving articles do not come from the deliberation of stale phrases or the embellishment of flowery words.</p>
<p>Many people say that Zhu Ziqing's "Back View" is a good article, and the author himself admits that that short essay is a relatively satisfactory one among his works. That article was published more than twenty years ago, but people have always loved to read it, and almost every junior high school Chinese textbook includes it. The reason why "Back View" is loved is really because the author has rich emotions and personal experience. It is not a hard-written article of pointless groaning. In addition, he can express his feelings with pure spoken language techniques, so even without so-called elegant words or beautiful words, simple spoken language can still touch people's hearts. An article like this can be understood even by middle school students or even elementary school students, but college students may not be able to write it, and they may not even be able to fully appreciate its benefits, right?</p>
<p>"Half a Cart of Wheat Straw," a short story that was widely circulated during the Anti-Japanese War, was written in the most popular spoken language. The reason why it was highly praised was because it had content and could use pure spoken language to express living people and a living society. Lao She's novels are also praised by many people. Some people say that his success lies in his ability to use pure spoken language to portray his typical characters.</p>
<p>Galsworthy said: "The secret of writing is very simple. Beginners should listen to plays more, pay attention to the lines of the performance, and carefully read the dialogues of the script, which can help with writing." We want our articles, whether it is a short essay of hundreds of words or a novel of millions of words, we have to ask ourselves: is this pure spoken language? In addition, we must live well, have a fulfilling life (to live a meaningful life in the social group, and to review and improve our lives at any time and any place. Developing correct and progressive ideas can all help with writing. As for how to enrich our vocabulary so that our language and articles can be expressed more perfectly and more fully, that is especially not to be ignored.</p>
<h3>Qinyuan Chun</h3>
<p>— Xu Junwu</p>
<p>Written with a Group Photo of Lu Mang</p>
<p>Eight years in Chongqing, drunk together in the east wind, writing epics together. Thinking of the sight of the land, swept away the fishy dust, enjoying the pleasantries, a grand gathering to pursue. Roosters crowed in the wind and rain, laughing at you and me, the articles written to serve the country are only a few. In our leisure, let’s say that in the south of the Yangtze River and the north of the Great Wall, we will again embrace the beauty. The reunion on the sea is truly strange! Who believes that it is the time to purify the sky? Let’s collect our sorrows, join shoulders, arrange the future, and express our feelings. Earthly fame and fortune, talent like precious pearls, traces of a spring dream may exist. Wielding the pen, watching the heroic posture, living up to the expectations.</p>
<h3>Double Flying Couple (20)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>If it is said that Shi Yulou also loved Madam Weng the Second, it would be better to say that Shi Yulou needed Madam Weng the Second appropriately. Fortunately, Madam Weng the Second still had some private jewelry, so she often bought opium and tonics to support Shi Yulou. Therefore, Shi Yulou felt that he could not live without Madam Weng the Second. As for feelings, he himself was very confused. It seemed that all his feelings were expressed in "the play"! He was no longer very aware of the difference between life and the play. Sometimes he even thought that the play was all of his life. He lived for the play, and for the play, he needed Madam Weng the Second. He couldn't explain this emotion clearly, so he had no way to tell Madam Weng the Second about it. Although he understood that Madam Weng the Second's heart was different from his, and he understood that Madam Weng the Second regarded him as all of her life, he did not think so. He secretly laughed at Madam Weng the Second for being a stupid person! Madam Weng the Second was attached to the secondary part of his life.</p>
<p>Why did Shi Yulou become like this? Because he was a mechanized actor. He had no knowledge other than "the play." Although he sang so many words, sentences, poems, and essays, he did not recognize a single word. The words, sentences, poems, and essays he sang were all passed down orally by his teacher. He could only understand these words, sentences, poems, and essays partially and did not know that these words, sentences, poems, and essays came from books. Therefore, he had no way to jump from the play to reality. And it was precisely because of this that he could not feel true happiness; or the genuine joy; nor could he feel true pain; or true worry!</p>
<p>Shi Yulou was still a kind-hearted person. When he realized that Madam Weng the Second had intentions for him, but he had no intentions for Madam Weng the Second, he took the opportunity to open his tightly sealed mouth and said solemnly to Madam Weng the Second:</p>
<p>"You know, I am an actor! A traveling actor! I will leave here at any time, that is, leave you!"</p>
<p>Madam Weng the Second nodded without surprise and said:</p>
<p>"I know! But I don't care at all."</p>
<p>"That's good!" Shi Yulou smiled happily again.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou never thought that Madam Weng the Second would give such a straightforward answer. This was simply not in line with the logic of Shi Yulou's general understanding of Madam Weng the Second! Although he was very happy, he was also a little strange. He couldn't believe that Madam Weng the Second's words came from sincerity. Based on Madam Weng the Second's past behavior, she would not have said these words. Because of these words, he felt that Madam Weng the Second only regarded him as an accessory to the secondary part of her life! So Shi Yulou felt insulted! Perhaps it was a hidden sadness? Shi Yulou regretted having such an unnecessary personal relationship.</p>
<p>Madam Weng the Second looked at Shi Yulou's contemplative and dazed expression and couldn't help but laugh. Naturally, she would not understand Shi Yulou's mood at this time, and she quite misunderstood Shi Yulou. She thought that Shi Yulou was testing her, and even worried about the future—Shi Yulou was reluctant to leave her. Therefore, she was secretly pleased! She felt supreme happiness and pride. She believed that Shi Yulou had been controlled by her and that Shi Yulou was deeply in love with her!</p>
<p>"Hey, you, who makes a living by 'opening your mouth,' why have you closed your golden mouth again?" Madam Weng the Second said jokingly.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou glanced blankly at Madam Weng the Second. He didn't know what Madam Weng the Second's words meant? How should he answer her? Then, from Madam Weng the Second's peaceful and happy expression, he felt a malicious mockery. So, he was simply angry! He thought, "So she is smarter than me. Her heart is the same as all the men and women who support me. I am an actor; she is a theatergoer; I am an object for her to pass the time. If I leave, there will still be other actors who will come to entertain her; so she doesn't 'care.' I am just a toy in her eyes! Yes, the theatergoers are smart, only the actors are stupid!" Thinking of this, Shi Yulou was filled with indignation, his face flushed red, and he resolutely waved his sleeves and wanted to leave.</p>
<h3>Our Group</h3>
<p>— Song Mu</p>
<p>He told me some things that happened after we parted. Although we only separated for five or six years, the changes in people evoked a strong sense of vicissitude. We sighed together for a while. I said it felt like listening to a hazy story, or having a long dream. He just replied indifferently, "Because we are all old."</p>
<p>I seemed to be immersed in past memories. A series of images floated in my mind. Back then, we were studying in the mountain city, and our days were filled with vitality and joy. We ran drama clubs, published wall newspapers... We were all naive, simple, and doing what we thought was a sacred cause, without worries or troubles. Who would have thought that the group of people would now be scattered like stars? He mentioned that tall guy with a very pretty face has been doing very poorly in recent years. He joined the army for a while and suffered constantly for pink romances. Now he is still wandering in a remote corner. And that burly northeasterner, I can easily remember him. When I left Annam, he even came to see me. His rough face was covered with bumps. He was easily angered, his eyes wide and round, as if he was about to fight someone. His smile was very ugly. At that time, he had a big falling out with another friend for a girl. After we separated, it is said that he was quite popular for a while. Now he is the deputy manager of an insurance company and has married a wife. He said that this once irritable man has become very docile. He does his job conscientiously. The girl he pursued in the past has also married. Everything seems very happy.</p>
<p>My friend, seeing me lowering my head and feeling depressed, impatiently reminded me:</p>
<p>"Do you remember that Shanghainese with the fair skin? We used to call him 'Little Slicker'?"</p>
<p>"Are you talking about the one who always had his hair slicked back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's him. He's setting up a street stall in Kunming now."</p>
<p>I was slightly stunned. I found it hard to believe.</p>
<p>"Wasn't he very capable?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. After leaving school, he initially opened a beef shop, but then I heard his private life was terrible, and he ended up in this situation."</p>
<p>Then, as if he suddenly remembered something, he patted my shoulder:</p>
<p>"Hey, do you want me to tell you something about that big-eyed girl?"</p>
<p>"Are you saying...?"</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten? I'm talking about the one who lived on Jiezishang Street, the place we used to love to go to in the countryside?" He paused, looked at me deeply, and then continued: "She often thought of you later, you know? Regretfully, you didn't even send a letter?"</p>
<p>"What is she doing now?"</p>
<p>"She got married a long time ago and has several children."</p>
<p>I was silent for a while, and my friend added.</p>
<p>"I heard that her current situation is not very good. She's not having a good time."</p>
<p>Perhaps my friend intentionally changed the subject. He asked if I remembered the camellia planted in front of our house. He said that because it wasn't the blooming season, otherwise he would have liked to bring me one or two branches. I smiled gratefully for my friend's kindness.</p>
<h3>Social Services. Readers' Letters Express Sincere Wishes. Vocational Youths Engage in Free Education.</h3>
<p>Hoping to Rent Suitable School Buildings in the Taishan District</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are all working youths with a passion for work and a strong desire to use our spare time to do something beneficial for society and the country. We want to run a free night school in the Taishan District to rescue some adults who have dropped out of school. Because they are the backbone of building a new China, they should have the opportunity to be educated. However, we are very unfamiliar with the education sector. Although there are now teachers who are willing to volunteer, and relatives and friends who are willing to help us financially, and we believe that there will certainly be eager students in the future, there is no place to have classes. Seeing that many school classrooms are empty at night, we only need to borrow them for two hours each day, and we are prepared to pay a reasonable rent, but we have no way to borrow them. We are waiting, hoping that the education authorities who are enthusiastic about education will extend a helping hand to us, lend us classrooms, help us establish this adult free school, and encourage and urge our courage to run it. We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, and we dare to ask you to disclose it for our good fortune. (Reader: Cai Ze)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: We greatly admire Mr. Cai and others' enthusiasm for free education. We hope that the school authorities in the Taishan District will provide support. Fortunately, they are willing to pay a reasonable rent. I think among the readers, someone will definitely do what is right for this public service, please send a letter to us.</p>

<h3>Xiaofan Elementary School Robbed</h3>
<p>Teachers and Staff Appeal for Relief</p>
<p>Director: Our school was suddenly robbed by bandits at around 7 p.m. on March 9. In addition to robbing 650,000 yuan of school fees, sundry expenses, and meal fees, and cash from each teacher, all of our colleagues' clothes, shoes, socks, and luggage were taken away, worth 5 million yuan. These are all the hard work of the teachers over the years. How can we not be heartbroken when they are robbed? We have no clothes to change, no clothes to change for the warm weather. At a time when prices are soaring, our meager monthly income is difficult to maintain. It is difficult to add shoes and socks, let alone add a dress or pants. Looking forward to the future, how can we live? Suffering this disaster, how can we feel at ease to educate? We have always admired your spirit, and your enthusiasm for good deeds. We sincerely state our difficulties and earnestly ask you to appeal to all circles for relief. The colleagues are extremely grateful. Respectfully, the entire faculty and staff of Shanghai Municipal Xiaofan Elementary School (School address: Jiazhuang, Jinjiaqiao, Pudong)</p>
<h3>Pudong Bank Exchanges Counterfeit Bills</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the exchange of legal tender for counterfeit bill holders, Pudong Bank has specially established a temporary counterfeit bill exchange office at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at Songxia Street, Zhongzheng East Road, and dispatched personnel to handle the exchange. As the deadline for the exchange of counterfeit bills is approaching and most merchants feel it is very difficult, this move by the bank provides many conveniences for those holding counterfeit bills, and its spirit of serving the community is admirable.</p>
<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhaoding of Cixi asked: Several years before the founding of the Republic, my ancestors pawned a house to A, receiving more than one hundred yuan of pawn money, for a term of ten years. More than ten years later, A also pawned it to B, also for a term of ten years. Last year, B's term also expired. I should prepare the money to take back the appraisal from A. According to A, the government issued an order before the war that all pawn contracts that are more than 30 years old cannot be retrieved. Is this command still valid today? Please advise.</p>
<p>Attorney Duanmu replied: Refer to the contents of the pawn contract, the Civil Law, the Real Estate Law, the Banking Law, and the detailed Real Estate Administration Regulations to handle it.</p>
<p>He Hansheng asked: I heard that there is a house owned by our family. During the War of Resistance, it was occupied by the enemy. I have not dared to ask about it for eight years. The contract was also destroyed during the escape. Currently, there are legal problems. Is there a way to register and file it to prevent unscrupulous people from causing trouble or extorting money? This matter is related to the land issue after the War of Resistance, and I hope to discuss it publicly.</p>
<p>Attorney Duanmu Kai replied: If you want to reclaim it, you should provide substantial evidence.</p>
<p>Dong Deshu asked: Before the war, I bought a store in Yangshupu, continuing to rent and operate it. Since the August 13th Shanghai War, I abandoned the store and goods and fled to the interior until the Japanese surrendered and returned to Shanghai. I learned that the former rented shop was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and set up as an office. I followed the regulations of the National Government for returning real estate and submitted it to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, and the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Administration Bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to request its return. It has been more than three months and there is still no progress. Please give instructions.</p>
<p>Attorney Duanmu Kai replied: You can submit an urging request to the competent official authority.</p>
