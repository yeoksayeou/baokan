<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕第十八次主席團會議，十六晨舉行。十六日下午三時，舉行第三次憲草綜合審委會，繼續討論國大組織及權限問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國大主席團十五日下午五時舉行第十七次會議，朱家驊主席，聽取各組審委會及綜合委會召集人報吿各組審查經過，當以綜合委會審查工作尙未竣事，決議大會延至十八日舉行。席間幷以憲法修訂工作恐尙需時日始可完成，對大會是否須再延期問題亦有所討論，預料十八日大會中或可提出討論，傳說大會將再延至廿五日始可閉幕。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕蔣主席十五日下午七時，召宴國民黨代表雷震等，對憲草問題有所垂詢，並囑能本民主精神，通過經協商後之憲草。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕憲草審查進行中，蔣主席爲尊重民主精神，隨時分別與國民黨及民社黨人士有所談洽。十二日下午八時，曾特別召見民社黨徐傅霖，詢對憲草態度。又十五日上午九時徐傳霖，蔣勻田曾應的訪孫科於其寓邸，再就憲草交換意見。據該黨某氏稱：主席及其高級幹部，均能竭誠遵守協商精神。民社黨某氏稱：本黨之參加國大原因，在希望（一）通過憲草，（二）政治改良（三）結束一黨治國，實現全國和平，如憲草原則變更，不啻將和平之路割斷，如果將來和談成功，此業經修改之憲法，豈非又必須全部推翻，故吾人並非認爲必須各黨派表示滿意，至少要各黨派能勉强接受。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕中國國民黨爲欲使憲草之修訂更趨民主化，十五日由吳鐵城，陳立夫，陳誠，召集國民黨國大代表茶會，交換意見，分上下午兩次集會，在勵志社舉行。由吳陳等致詞，希望各代表能本民主精神，討論憲草的修訂，允盼能遵照政協精神，依照協議之原草案，在原則上不必變更。繼由各代表分別發表意見，討論至爲熱烈。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕吳鐵城，陳立夫，張羣，雷震，十五日午以國民黨名義，邀宴民社黨國大代我團。吳首先致詞，略稱，希望各黨派能一本互助合作之精神，完成此一憲法。旋徐傳霖代表民社黨致答覆，略稱，此一憲法，並非國民黨之憲法，亦非民社黨之憲法，而是中華民國之憲法。我們所以參加國大，亦即爲此，我們決能本此精神，推誠相見，以完成此中華民國之憲法。席間空氣極爲融治。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕民社黨領袖張君勱，十五日晨在滬閱報後，知憲草經過審查有所修改復議時，不能將出席三分之二改爲全體三分之二。該黨發言人蔣勻田十五日晚復告記者，民社黨對第一條意見，仍堅持中華民國爲民主共和國，連原案亦不贊同，對憲草修正意見，並非絕對或一字不予修改，而是希望能修正得更爲民主，其原則是萬不可修改，如果違反原來協議，而隨意修改，則民社黨當採取適當態度。記者詢其是否退出國大，蔣氏不予置答，僅稱：何種態度最不負責，即採取之。</p>
<h3 id="c2">綜合委會二次會　繼續討論國大代表組織　邊疆代表問題掀起激辯 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕憲草綜合審委會十五日上午十時五十分開第二次會議，出席代表一二二人，由王世杰主席，對憲草修正案第二十六條關於國民大會代表組織之規定，繼續討論。合江職業代表畢天民，首先對綜合審委會拒絕記者旁聽一點，提出質問。王主席富答以係主席團之决定，旋開始發言，蘇職代表曾濟寬主張直轄市代表名額應予規定。蒙古代表劉踪萍主張，邊疆民族代表，亦應予較多數目之規定。傅斯年認爲第一項區域選舉，每多三十萬人即增選代表一人之規定，將便國大過於龐大，主席乃報吿召集人會議，曾決定擬修改爲每多一百萬人增一代表，請衆考慮。自山職業代表阮志道等，復認爲如此規定，又嫌過嚴，紛紛反對，多主張改爲每多五十萬人增選代表一人。至此李中襄主張，婦女選舉不應特殊規定，皮以書起而反對，謂目前社會情况，婦女參加區域競選時，決難獲勝，爲提高女權，應加規定。江一平主張，區域選舉與職業選舉應並重。谷正綱從旁附和。羅家倫，林彬，杜光塤，王孝英，黃正淸，孔庚等，均相繼發言，唯均無具體主張，主席宜稱，除第一項觸於區域選舉有主張修改爲每多五十萬人增選代表一人外，第二·三·四·五等項均無修正案提出，主張將原審查結果提出大會，但若干代表仍要求繼續討論。畢天民，楊砥中等相繼發言，堅主加列土著民族之選舉，並將蒙藏及其他少數民族之代表，分配名額加多規定，反對者，認爲土著民族分布，並無區域性，不應列於區域選舉之外。至各少數民族之代表名額，即予規定，亦應依照比例。辯論之聲，達於戶外。主席權將渠所提將審查意見提出大會之主張付諸表決，亦不得解決，至十二時正仍未獲得任何結果，乃於混亂中散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國民大會綜合委員會下午三時四十分續會，出席代表一五五人，仍由王世杰主席，首對十四日已日明之綜合審委會職權一點，再予複述謂，綜合審委會即第九審委會，與其他八審委會之地位相等，其職權乃在討論關聯並各組涉及原則之諸問題，所作之決議，並不能改變其他八審委會之審查意見，如有不同之　查結果，均將併提大會，渠並籲請各代表就題發言，提出具體意見，節省時間。繼報吿該會召集人當午集議之結果，將整理後之具體條文付諸表決；第二十六條審查意見第一項「但其人口逾三十萬者」之「三十萬」修改爲「五十萬」，獲七十五票通過。第二項修改爲「蒙古各旗（下删一「及」字）西藏（下增七字）及其他邊疆地區選出（下增一字）之代表，其名額以法律定之。」獲八十票通過，但劉踪萍，麥煥新，仍相繼發言，對第二項表示反對。劉堅稱，綜合審委會應考慮第八審委會關於邊疆民族選舉名額之意見，不能以召集之意見，遽付表決，允不能以爲多數壓迫少數。另一部代表認爲邊疆民族選舉名額之規定，難求一律，應隨時隨地制宜，另以法律規定會議之精神，在多數尊重少數，少數服從多數，大會對邊疆同胞之意見，已尊重備至，不能仍稱遭受壓追，强多數服從少數。激辯由此再度展開，會塲空氣又形緊張。旋傅斯年發言，以此案已表決通過，應迅速進行以下之討論。主席亦宣布，如有代表不贊成此項之表決，請保留意見，至大會發表，若必欲於綜合審委會提出覆議，則須依民權初步規定之程序辦法。至此劉不同，李中襄，乃提出婦女問題搬回會議方式，主張婦女之選舉及名額之比例，應規定於選舉法中，且廿六條審查意見第五項中「婦女團體」之辭過於糢糊，究竟範圍如何，性質如何，均易引起憲法之解釋，問題徒滋糾紛，反對將此項明列憲法之內。女代表高逸雲·王孝英等，復堅決反對。對第四項職業選舉之規定，劉不同亦認爲，各國憲法均將此種特殊規定，且「職業團體」之範圍性質不明，有剝奪普選民權之處，亦反對明列憲法之內，曾濟寬等亦堅決反對。</p>
<p>激辯兩塲之餘，王主席宣布，將此兩項保留，進至大會討論決定。</p>
<p>劉踪萍再次發言聲稱，如綜合審委會對第二項之決定不加以覆議，蒙古代表在大會中將一致反對。王冠英當予以同情謂，綜合審委會不顧及第八審委會之審查意見，有弄權之嫌。谷正綱復以四，五兩項之保留，闡述綜合審委會須具有協調作用，一時評譏紛紛四起。李中襄乃起爲緩頰稱，主席之聲明將問題保留至大會提出，並非推翻審查意見，亦非不承認會衆意見，渠並建議將邊疆民族選舉名額問題，留待硏討，至第八審委會審查意見時再行討論。劉踪萍則頻頻發言，對第二項修正意見之表決堅不承認。婦女代表·職業代表·邊疆代表·土著代表均接續發言，各言其是，會塲秩序，混亂不堪。傅斯年就蒙古代表名額提出一旗一人之建議，及黄正淸有關土著民族問題之折衷意見，均淹沒於辯潮之中。其他代表之言論，更屬混聲大合唱，不知所云。至五時廿分，王主席已失全會塲之控制力，當接受胡適之提議宣吿散會，並接續召開主席團與綜合審委召集人之聯席會議，俾便有所商討，求取解決問題之原則，各代表乃於紛紛討論評議中相率離去。</p>

<h3 id="c4">孫亞夫對記者暢談總統緊急命令權　憲草不宜另增「緊急事變」四字 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕關於昨日第三審查委員會修正憲草第四十四條條文，增加「緊急事變」四字，當時孫代表亞夫主張維持原案，對增加四字提出異議，終以表決未獲通過。頃孫氏鄭重對記者表示，特誌之於下：緊急命令權原爲帝制時代君主之標，在民主憲政國家絕無此項規定。在民主國家，對於人民之基本權利與自由，行政機關不能侵犯或限制，恐其隨便或籍故發佈命令，加害人民，故防之未然，多不列元首有頒發緊急命令之權。設遇外患內亂災害等非常事變發生，可由國會決議臨時授權行政機關爲緊急之揹施，以示此權操於人民，主權之代表的國會，本憲法草案等四十條已有戒嚴專條，戒嚴法內容即可包括外患內亂災害等非常事變之應付。縱使在戒嚴法以外，有另訂緊急命令法之必要，則第四十四條原案文字已足應付，不可再加入含混而無確切定義之「緊急事變」四字，爲異日預留濫發緊急命令之無限危機。考諸英美法諸憲政先進國，即對戒嚴法之規定，亦限制綦嚴。茲略述梗槪：</p>
<p>（一）法國平時由國會先制定戒嚴法，載明原因種類宣吿機關及戒嚴宣吿之結果。若遇眞實之現象，即由所在地官吏司令先行戒嚴，一面再由國會宣吿戒嚴。但國會閉會期間，則由總統主持國務會譏，經決議後宣吿之。至國會因總統之宣吿，則於二日內自行集會議決。是此權操之國會明矣。</p>
<p>（二）英國平時無戒嚴法之頒佈，遇有非常事變，亦不承認內閣有頒緊急命令之權，必待國會議定新法律，始能限制人民之自由。但地方官　或軍事長官，可作緊急應付，待事後由政府咨國會通過免罪法，以減除違法責任，其防止行政人員濫用職權，較法國制度爲嚴。</p>
<p>（三）美國國會與行政機關俱須依憲法之規定行使職權，國會不能如英法國會有變更或限制人民自由之權，但應付非常事變亦未見貽誤事機。</p>
<p>總之，人民自由爲神聖不可侵犯者，處今日之中國，議憲者亟宜力求保障人民自由與防止政府之越權剝奪人權。故緊急命令權如不能根本取消，至多亦祇能依四十四條原案所規定之範圍，以遇有天然災害或國家財政經濟上有重大變故時爲限，不宜另增「緊急事變」四字。</p>

<h3 id="c10">晉察綏邊區視察印象　美記者論中共軍事失敗原因 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕美國時代雜誌駐京記者葛里恩，最近一遍遊晋察綏邊區，對於共軍肆意破壞情形，有深切之認識，彼深信共軍在察綏之失敗，不僅在軍事上有重大之意義，即在其內部之精神上，亦發生重大之影響。葛氏近在該難誌撰文，說明其視察之印象，葛氏通訊原文首稱：「中共在日軍一年前退出之西北戰略地區所施行之新民主政治，因措置失宜，與其軍事計劃同歸失敗，此乃本人經歷艱辛，遭遊晋察綏邊區歸來所得之結論。「葛氏次以「摧毀之窗橱」爲題，敍述張垣情形稱：張家口爲晋察邊區經濟命派所　，日人在此，留下相當龐大之經濟建設，日人投降後，此項建設大部完整，中共據此用爲賞通延安及東北之走廊，並作爲陳列其「民主政治」之廣吿窗積，然彼等不但在軍事上無法保衛此地區，竟在政府軍隊迫近時，摧毀此「窗橱」，在民窮財盡之中國，此項破壤實令人痛心疾首。巾共撤退後村星期，張家口之水電供應仍未恢復，車站成爲被　機車殘骸之墓地，工人宿舍，僅餘斷璧頹垣，中共在其名爲「解放路」上縱火熒燬郵局，其對面　爲擁有四千用戶之電話局，今亦成一片瓦礫，除破壞交通電訊設施外，中共復破壞工廠五二家，使三千工人及其家屬流離失所。</p>
<p>葛氏次引用「暫時之痛苦」爲題，說明共軍在口泉所施之焦土政策，其文曰：口泉煤礦，位於人口八十萬，被圍四十五日之大同城外十英里，附近有華北最偉大之發電廠，共軍於八月一日攻佔口泉，十月卅一日與國軍接觸後退出，彼等撤離口泉時，同樣大肆破壞，鍊鐵廠，堰車床，盡被破壞，燒壞之機車，隨處皆是，殘壞五金器材與瓦礫，，遍布各處，中共在政治宣傳方面調，此種破壞爲暫時之痛苦，但「暫時之痛苦」一語，在兵蓮禍結之中國，已成爲最酸痛之詞句，同時，中共亦因此而失去游擊戰略中最重要之民衆支援。</p>
<p>最後葛氏以「心情之改變」爲題，說明中共內部人員精神之動搖，據稱：在張垣中共俘擄集中處之鐵絲綱後，發現下列現象，即共軍士氣已日形减低，一般士兵於踏入無止境荆棘遍地而以同胞爲敵之內戰時，固難怪共鴃乏鬥志，共軍中有王友明者，十七歲時投身入路，轉戰入載，現已升任　附，在抗日戰學負傷四次，九月間傅作義將軍所部向張　推進，王友　及其部下四十餘人，奉命固守集寗，國軍迫近時，部下廿三名戰死，王亦被迫撤退，王在極度錯綜之情緒中，自問「中國人何故打中國人」，我等何故死在集寗，後王爲一中共政治指導員（此項人員，乃共黨主義之忠實信徒，並曾參加二萬五千里長征者）所責問，談話時，王坦率承認良心吿我不能再打內戰，該員沉思片刻後，吿王曰：「倘君心眞係如此，則願休息，必須愼重考慮，候心情改變時，再回現在之崗位」。所謂「休息」者，乃遣至後方山中，予以監視，嗣後該員不斷訪王，但王之心情始終不寗，且謂：「我須多加思索，與日人作戰，我曾受盡千辛萬苦，然我不後慮，因當時我之良心與我共同奪鬥，但現在我之良心不令我作目前之工作」。爲時未幾，國軍收復張垣，王部率令退入山中，王故意蹣跚隊後，致書請降國軍後，與團軍某部取得聯緊，而其良心亦重獲自由。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕美國賠　委員鮑萊，向杜魯門總統提出朝鮮北部（蘇聯佔領區）之六日考察報告，內稱：蘇聯之目標，或爲強迫在朝鮮全境設立莫斯科支配之政府，然後同意撤退其駐軍。鮑萊調查團一行十九人，由配備美國步槍之蘇聯士兵一隊伴同進入朝鮮北部。蘇聯人直接並堅決防止美國人與朝鮮人談話，甚至謂將射擊美國人的翻譯員。在某一點，蘇聯某將官吿鮑萊美國人，倘不停止攝影，則將後悔莫及。鮑萊稱：渠初次與朝鮮境內蘇軍統帥契斯蒂可夫中將會晤時，契氏對於美國調查團所經過之區域不能表示同意。鮑萊即用外交手腕，贈予契中將精美佩劍一柄，兩人二次會議較爲融洽。契氏回贈鮑萊精美匕首一柄，並饗以典型的羅宋大菜，伏特加酒儘量供給，超過飲量倍。鮑萊稱：「調查團在經過工廠時，火車每加速行駛，此舉或者爲偶合，亦未可知。」當蘇聯方面稱某一機械工具廠並不存在時，鮑萊即命其朝鮮譯員張某試去尋覓。鮑萊稱：「此爲相當重大之任務，因蘇聯軍官命蘇聯及朝鮮譯員包圍張君，此人一舉一動，必遭監視，每發一問，必遭呼喝。彼等顯然不欲使吾等自朝鮮人獲得任何情報」。最後廠址在某電力廠之旁發現，電力廠之設備搬走一空。鮑萊發現朝鮮北部工業依然活動，與中國東九省工業破壞情形不同，但蘇聯似正向人民宣傳共產主義，並謀控制一切行政與經濟權，街頭張縣橫旗，讚揚蘇聯政府爲」民主之最高形式」。但有若干徵兆，證明朝鮮人與蘇聯佔領軍並不充分合作。鮑萊稱：「黄昏後蘇軍與朝鮮人之間事端層出不窮，契斯蒂可夫將軍不得不頒佈命令，規定黄昏後，舉身　兵出行必須有兩人伴行，但每次仍然有蘇兵兩三人被殺死，朝鮮人除石塊外，別無武器」。</p>

<p>法國社會黨領袖勃魯姆獲得法國各黨派的擁護當選內閣總理之後，即開始組織內閣，連日以來，與各黨派的領袖會商組閣事宜，當可望於日內完成組閣的任務。戰後的法國也正在多難之秋，全國人民均迫切期望新內閣能够早日成立，俾能應付當前所面臨的各種困難問題。據勃魯姆本人向全國人民發表廣播演說，亦希望新閣能於日內組成，俾能於明日出席國民大會，同時又表示盼望新內閣早日成立，較之任何人，尤爲迫切。準此而論，法國新內閣在前人民陣綫領袖勃魯姆領導之下，必能於日內組織吿成，自然沒有問題的了。</p>
<p>戰後的法國，雖然也是多難的國家，尤其是在金融經濟方面，千孔百瘡，欲言復興繁榮，實在不是一件容易的事情；但是戰後一年以來的法國政治，却獲得了長足的進步，有人稱法國爲歐洲新生的國家，亦非過譽。這一年來，法國舉行了好幾决的普選，結果都是左派政黨獲得優勢，不論在國民大會或在參議會中，共產黨都處於領導地位，惟其敵黨人民共和黨所得的議席，相差無幾，因此共產黨對於任何問題，假如得不到社會黨，激進社會黨以及左派結集運動黨的支持，就不能獲得絕大多數。例如這次國民大會選舉內閣總理，共產黨領袖多萊士，就沒有獲得必要的票數，以致於落選，第二次投票，人民共和黨候選人即現任臨時總統兼內閣總理曁外長比杜爾，也步多萊士的後塵而吿失敗。這種現象在各國的政黨政治的歷史上，是很少見的。最後由各黨派領袖會談的結果，始決定擁護社會黨領袖勃魯姆爲內閣總理候選人，提交國民大會表决，在各黨派議員的一致擁護下，終算獲得了必要的票數而當選。但是勃魯姆內閣的基礎，完全建立在各黨派的妥協上，並不十分鞏固，是不言可知的。</p>
<p>但是放眼看看法國國內的經濟情形，再回頭瞧瞧國際的環境，在此時出任內閣總理，最適當的人選，除了勃魯姆一人而外，實在不容易物色第二個人。說來原因很簡單，因爲法國政府常前所面臨的最嚴重的問題，就是金融財政問題。法國在第二次大戰中，旣受了戰爭的浩刦，又遭到德國佔領的蹂躪，元氣大傷，一時不容易恢復。所以自法國獲得解放以來，法國人民的生活，並未因解放而獲得改善；今後如欲復興與繁榮，則非設法取得外國的經濟援助不可。勃魯姆在今年的春夏兩季，不辭長途跋涉的勞苦，曾前往倫敦華府，分別訪問英美當局，商訂英法美法經濟協定，均已獲得重大成就。所以勃魯姆不僅對於法國國內經濟情形，知之甚諗，而且照目前的情勢看來，唯有勃魯姆出任艱鉅，始能解決法國當前的經濟困難。</p>
<p>至於戰後法國的國際環境、法國正處於斯拉夫與英美兩大集團之間，常常感到左右爲難的痛苦，處境的困難，是不言可知的。最近十多個月來，法國的外交政策，在比杜爾外長賢明的領導之下，的確收到相當的成效。尤其在歷决國際會議中，法國終站在兩大集團的中間，排難解紛，盡其調處的能事，做媾通雙方意見的橋樑，對於歷决國際會議的成就，莫不有重大的貢獻。但是國際間的悲歡離合，有其客觀的因素，決非任何一國所能左右，比杜爾外長有時也感覺到苦悶，而有力不從心之感。所以此際出任艱鉅的法國政治家，必須爲雙方所能歡迎的人物，勃魯姆就是具有這種雙重人格最適當的人選。</p>
<p>法國人是意見最多的民族，人人對於政治都有他特有的見解，反映在政治上，便形成了小黨林立的現象，所以法國以的政黨政治，是民主先進國最不好的一個國家，尤其是一般政客，播弄是非，翻風覆雨，使法國的政潮層出不窮，政局很少有穩定的時候，以致旣定的國策，不容易貫澈。這是戰前法國政治最不行的地方。戰後政治雖然進步了，但是這個不幸的現象，依然存在，使我們對於勃魯姆內閣的前途，不能抱着過分的奢望。所以一般政治觀察家，對於勃魯姆內閣的前途，都不敢過分樂觀，而深恐勃魯姆內閣是一種過波性質的政府，壽命是不會長久的。何况勃魯姆本人，雖於一九三六年出任人民陣綫內閣總理，具有豐富的政治經驗；但是年事已高，健康可憂，能否長期担當得起這一個重祖？實在還是一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>但是在目前的法國，最迫切需要的，就是政局的安定，决不可再像戰前那樣政潮迭起，使國家的旣定政策，不能貫撤；各黨派的領袖，應該接受第二次大戰法國戰敗的敎訓，將國家的利益超出於黨派之上，而能和衷共濟，爲法國的復興而努力，即使勃魯姆內閣是一個臨時性質的過波政府，但在短短的時期內必能爲各黨派通力合作共謀法國的復員，開闢一條新的途徑。這是法國內外人士對於勃魯姆內閣所抱的共同期望；同時也是勃魯姆本人的願望。</p>

<p>本市房捐估價過高</p>
<p>頃閱　貴報所載盧興厚律師批評本市房捐不當一文，實爲市民公意之所在。惟盧律師在法言法，僅就其不合法律之點言之，而對於實際超額浮估情形，尙未論及。茲請加以補充：以見市民不堪此項重稅之痛苦，查財政局所發秋季房捐繳款書，其最不合理之黑點，爲祇知增加收入，隨意將租價估高，而不顧實際。例如敝處所租房屋一幢，廿六年房租爲每月九十元，（有業主房票爲證，每季不過二百七十元，而財政局佔爲四千五百元，徵收房捐及市政捐四十五萬元，竟較實際房租，浮估十餘倍，查戰前虹口通常房屋，每幢至多月租一二百元，此爲久居上海之人所習知，今財政局竟估至一千五百元之巨，或爲重慶飛來，未知滬市情形。且上海房屋除私人出租者，其契約賬簿及房票，容或可以偽造，不足採證外，至由正式銀行經租者，其賬簿單據，組織皆極完備，自有合法之證據，不容否認，今財政局不憑廿六年合法之證件，以計算房捐，而但憑理想，隨意估定，要非合法。况房捐估價方法，前工部局有良好成例可循，而財政局並未採用。聞前工部局房捐檔案具在，財政局儘可調卷查核，根據廿六年房捐數目，以推算房租，尤爲精確。乃亦不此之圖，馴至隨意指損，形同勒派，凡我巿民，自宜同聲抗議，應請財政局將此項不合法之估價，一律撤銷，按照實際租金，重訂捐額，以恤民隱，並請參議員諸公之見報者，速行提案糾正。（陳冠宇）</p>
<h3 id="c71">兩塊靈璧石轟動揚州城 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 揚州訊　本報特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>看了本文的題目，讀者也許要疑問：「怎麼？兩塊石頭竟把揚州輛動了麽」？記者的答覆是：「唔」。</p>
<p>愛好古董　買進石頭</p>
<p>事情出在此間三和　菜公可的老闆梁典成身上，這位梁老闆一向是個著名的愛好古董的人；尤其對於字畫，說得火一點，他愛好得間直古怪，在外面跑，在應酬塲中，遇有名家的眞東西發現，如果是可以出錢便能買的，他便不惜重資將它買回來；如果所有者——東西的主人，是幷不在乎錢的，他則不惜化費許多精神，動其腦筋，靠朋友的關係或其他迎絡的方式，把心所嚮往的東西總歸要轉到手。</p>
<p>有沈大可渚，是梁老闆的友人在去年，曾有一批字畫說好可以讓給他，當時這位梁老闆就交出定錢九十萬元與沈，後來，沈的字畫却讓給了別人，結果，梁老闆自然成了沈的九十萬元的債戶。</p>
<p>到前月裏，沈爲了要還梁的這九十萬元的債，就將家中存有的兩塊靈璧石來作抵。愛好字畫的人對於石頭是也會感覺興趣的，加之，這兩塊石頭確有些希奇，敲起來會像「磐」一樣的發出聲音，梁典對於這些于古董，又一向是個明眼者，於是，在不算買賣而實在是買賣的情形下，一天下午，這兩塊靈璧石，便由梁公司裏的幾個伙計從沈的家中抬到到了梁的家巾。</p>
<p>體態玲瓏　可供賞玩</p>
<p>需要幾個伙計　，兩塊石頭的前最可想而知了。同時，是因爲有海棉木座的原故。　石頭的形狀爲臥龍式石頭的色質在表面上，和一般靑山石似乎並沒有什麽不同，但，敲起來的確有一種金屬聲發出，記者的寓所便是梁老闆的屋子，所以如此淸楚。不過，石頭的其他好處，記者始終莫明其妙。最多是「體態玲瓏可供玩賞而已」。</p>
<p>石頭放在梁老闆的花廳中已有一個星期，不想岔子在將石頭從沈大可家中抬出來的時候便有了。</p>
<p>遜淸貢品　價值連城</p>
<p>原來，的伙計將石頭抬在路上時，有曾任前第八中學敎師之唐叔眉先生，他瞥見以後，立刻注意起來，並且一直尾隨至梁家的大門口。因爲：這位唐先生知道，在舊揚州府署裏，「即前第八中學所在地）是也，有兩塊靈璧石的，那兩塊靈璧石，傳係」遜淸時代揚城鹽商黄穎泰，在安徽購進，準備作進獻乾隆皇帝的貢品，嗣因乾隆駕崩，未及呈獻，遂留存於揚州府署。這樣，唐先生所以關心了，因爲：他以爲梁典買來的兩塊靈璧石，便是舊揚州府署裏的公物。</p>
<p>該是由關心公物到愛惜公物，終於爲保護公物吧？唐叔眉先生便將所見的情形報了縣府。縣府據報後、便派員調查，繼即將梁家中的石頭抬至縣府，這麽一來，社會上的傳說可沸沸揚揚了，有說兩塊石頭變賣起來要値數千萬元，並且舉出一個洋人曾要買的例子。有說兩塊石頭乃無價之寶，理由是：否則就能作爲進獻皇帝的貢品了麽？</p>
<p>公物私物　尙待判別</p>
<p>這樣的岔子出了以後，梁典成則表示，石頭旣是公家的，可以歸於公家好了，買價九十萬元，算在別的上面用掉的。但是，社會上接着有了另一種傳說，說他盜買公物。他聽到了可急了，因爲：舊揚州府署在敵偽時期，被敵寇整整佔駐達八年，誰也沒有去看過那裏面的雨塊靈璧石存與不存。即連報吿縣府的唐叔眉先生也是如此。勝利以後，國軍駐紮了，自然還是沒有誰會特地跑去看看這兩塊石頭的興織。</p>
<p>但是，出了岔子的梁典可不同了，除了問明沈大可他賣與他的兩塊靈璧石的確不是公物外，乃跑至舊揚州府署裏去到處尋公家的兩塊靈璧石，結果，在馬糞堆　，竟讓他尋着了一塊，經過邑紳胡顯伯陪同察看，說這石頭確是舊有原物，於是，梁典成還特爲這石頭攝了一張照。但是，另一塊却至今還未尋着，事情至今也就還不能完。</p>
<p>前天（八日）縣政府方面，爲重視公物，同時爲尊重報吿人愛護公物的精神，本預備請揚城社會名流失宗英。陳含光·戴星一·包翔仲·朱幹臣·楊祚杰等諸先生到縣府共同鑑定：梁典成向沈大可所買的兩塊石頭究竟是否非公物？以了結此一公案。結果因被請者未曾到全，不能鑑定，於是，這件公案，到今天還在爲全揚州的人們注目着。（十一日）行總柳州難童收容所景象（行總攝）</p>

<h3 id="c72">聯合國大會宣告閉幕　持久和平基礎奠定　裁軍大憲章獲大會通過　南非聯邦要求合併西南非被否決 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十四日電〕聯合國第一屆大會之第二部份宣吿結束，事實上已使聯合國機構正式產生，因此人類由共同行動爭取持久和平之基礎，業已奠定矣。第一屆大會之第一部份係於今年初在倫敦舉行。在兩部份會議中，聯合國機構之各重要機關已吿產生、安全理事會與經濟及社曾理事會係在倫敦產生，託管理事會經今日之表決已在紐約成立。至此，整個計劃已宣吿完成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十四日電〕聯合國全體大會在歡呼聲中通過「裁軍大憲章」，教促各國限制並普遍裁减其所保持之軍備。普遍縮减軍備，規定有效之保證，俾遵守之各國獲有保障，並規定管制原子炸彈之條例。所通過該決議案之最後方式計九節，昨夜英外相貝文美國務卿貝爾納斯蘇外長莫洛托夫常討論之際，均發冗長之演說，延至午夜後始已。但今日僅作半小時之討論，即經通過。今日演說者僅加拿大之馬丁與法國之巴洛狄，均熱切贊助該案。英代表蕭古洛斯在委會中曾贊同此建議，並透露將於六個月內召集裁軍大會。昨夜之討論，緒代表之友人與公衆之勞聽員滿集會塲，以聆三外長滔滔發言贊助該案，今日均感疲憊，而大會復匆遽結束此事，故到者不若昨夜之擁擠。雖莫洛托夫與維辛斯基曾在辯論中努力發表蘇聯之意見，而今日亦未蒞塲，親覩其工作獲最後滿意之結果。</p>
<p>聯大會本日除通過「裁軍大憲章」而外，尙通過下列各案：（一）聯合國明年度預算計總額二千七百七十四萬美元，包括國際法庭經費六十（一）萬八千美元以上在內。美國應付百分之三九·八九，英國百分之一一·四八，蘇聯百分之六·三四，中國與法國各付百分之六。（二）關於政治及安全委會對於調查各會員國國外駐軍一項問題所提出之計劃。蘇代表即該國外次葛羅米柯對於此項計劃，表示異議，並請，有關各會員國所當提供之情報，若不同時提出關於一般軍備之詳細情報，則仍感不足。蘇聯所持立塲，仍主張國外駐軍問題，應與其國內所保有軍隊問題相提並論，故本人要求安理會應決定何種情報，爲實施裁减軍備所必需，乃請求聯合國大會決定調查各會員國軍隊不應以其國外駐軍爲限，抑几其國內所保持之軍隊亦應包括在內云。最後聯大會仍將政治及安全委會所提出之調查軍隊計劃提付表決，以卅六票對六票予以通過，列强均投反對票，四國代表棄權。（三）關於托管問題，丹麥印度及美國三國代表所提出之決議草案，主張南非聯邦不得歸併其代管地西南非，亦以卅七票之多數予以通過，九國代表棄權。此外，墨西哥及伊拉克兩國各得卅六票及卅四票，當選爲託管理事會理事國。大會於午後六時十五分宣佈散會。</p>
<h3 id="c73">託管理事會成立　中美英蘇等十國任理事 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕聯大會今日已成立託管理事會，參加者計十國，其主要目的在使全世界數百萬非自治人民最後獲得獨立。此爲聯合國機構中最後成立之重要組織，與業已成立之安全理事會，經濟社會理事會，國際法庭及秘書處，同爲聯合國憲章所規定，使此世界和平機構得臻完備。託管理事會最初僅將監督八處託管領土之行政，此八處均係前國聯委任統治地，共有居民一千五百萬人，但望將來能有一日，使現在缺乏完全獨立之數萬萬人民，全體或多數歸其治下。理事會之主要目的，係欲令受其監督之全部領土，逐漸趨向獨立，其目前任務則在確知託管領土均能按照其居民之最佳利益管理。大會已選舉墨西哥與伊拉克兩國祖任理事，與中·英·美·蘇·法·比利時·澳大利及紐西蘭八國當然理事，合成十席。此後如續有其他領土加入託管，則理事席數亦將隨之變更。例如前日本代管地馬紹爾羣島·卡羅林羣島及馬利安納羣島，一旦加入託管，美國即成爲一管理國，而須添選一非管理國理事。杜魯門總統新近宜布，前日本代管地在最近期內，即將提出作爲「職略區」託管領土。現在即受託管理事會管轄之領土，爲英屬吐谷　·喀麥隆·坦干尼格，法屬吐谷蘭·喀麥隆，紐西蘭代管之西薩摩亞，澳洲代管之新幾內亞，及比利時代管之倫達烏倫達。南非聯邦請求兼併西甫非代管地一案，已由大會否決，命將該地交由聯合國託管。</p>
<h3 id="c74">召開非自主區會議　菲律賓修正案通過 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十四日電〕聯合國大會今日以極大多數通過菲律賓所提有關召開非自治土地及人民區域會議之決議，並古巴對該項決議所提之修正案。當大會辯論菲律賓之提案時，英美兩國均堅決反對，其後由中國代表顧維鈞提出一折衷方案，繼由古巴代表提出另一修正案，爭議始息。當菲律賓之修正案最後付諸表決時，計有卅一票贊成，一票反對，二十票棄權。通過之決議稱：「聯合國大會建議凡聯合國中代管非自治土地之會員國，應召開會議，其代表係由非自治土地之民衆中遴選或選出，俾使此等民衆得有機會表示其願望及意同，而與聯合國憲章之字面及精神相符」。大會表決前曾經冗長之辯論，美代表杜勒斯與英代表伊伏爾要求拒絕此項決議，咸謂根據其現行形式，實與憲章精神不符。法代表巴洛狄亦激烈反對，聲稱此項決議將動搖憲章之基礎，結果將在各國間造成紊亂猜疑與不信。至此，中國代表顧維鈞以調人立塲發言去，根據本人意見，雙方均已提出眞切之論據，但所提出之問題實過於重要，千百萬人民正在期待答復，不能默然置之。本席主張菲律賓之決議，應修正爲「代管非自治土地之國家應由聯合國社經理事會邀請召集此等土地之民衆會議」。菲律賓代表羅末洛當即向顧氏致謝。美代表亦稱願根據協調精神表示贊同，但法代表仍表反對。再經相當時間討論後，由古巴代表提出一新修正案，主張各會員國如認爲情形許可，應直接召開非自治人民區域會議。此項修正案卒以三分之二多數獲得通過。</p>
<h3 id="c75">限制使用否決權 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>小國力爭終告失敗</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕各小國欲剝奪五大國在安理會中之否決權，終年力爭，今日已吿失敗，不得不表示讓步，此聯合國機構中糾紛最甚之問題，已暫時吿一段落。各小國艱苦奮鬥之所獲，僅作成一項議案，籲請中美蘇英法五國儘量少用否決機，終未能將其取消。但據種種指示，各小國於稍後仍將繼續奪鬥，直至五大國問自行協定不再需應用此項特權爲止。蘇聯曾運用否決權達九次之多，故在討諭中首當其衝，但始終堅持不屈，投票反對此一議案。五大國中僅蘇聯一國獨持反對，惟斯拉夫集團與以贊助。</p>
<h3 id="c76">新聞自由會議　決定明年召開 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐的十四日電〕聯大會今日決定聯合國社經理事會明年內召開國際新聞自由會議，藉以規定新聞自由之責任·權利·與行使之方法。參加此項會議之代表。必須爲與報界·廣播界·電影界等有密切關係之人物，或者在上述各界中曾有經騐者。大會通過之決議，强調獲致及維護新聞自由之必要，藉以促成國際間誠懇之合作。決議中第一部份稱：「新聞自由爲人類基本權利之一。政治新聞自由爲爭取世界和平與進步之必要因素。新聞自田之原則，應規定享有此項權利者，不能故意予以濫用。不存偏見，搜索事實，與不懷惡意予以發表之道義責任，及新聞自由之一種主要因素。再者，如無健全與隨時留意之世界輿情，則國際間之諒解與合作實不可能，而爲達成此點，亦需要求完全之新聞自由也」。</p>

<p>第卅九號機起飛後，即向西二十度方向飛行，擬往蘇州南郊羣山中探索。記者自一千五百呎上空俯瞰，田畝阡陌河道茅屋歷歷可見。媧靑浦後，尤多湖治，飛越澱山湖，澄湖，九里湖沼。二時許，媧蘇州南郊之寳帶橋，專機即轉向西西南飛行，移時即臨洞庭東山上空。機中人員俱極緊張，當專機環繞此小小山邱飛翔時，咸窮目之所及，向山麓，山腰，山脊等處探視，但見黄土白石，平靜如恒，絕無異狀。環飛兩匝的十分鐘後，隨又轉往他處。舉凡洞庭西山，羊山，以及光福，善人橋，木瀆鎭附近諸山，若穹　山，七子山，靈巖山等靡不詳加探索，甚至東岸半頃太湖，亦經尋遍，前後耗時一小時有半，終無所獲，乃即歸航。三時四十五分，返抵龍華機塲降落，飛行恰爲二小時。另一專機第四十七號，亦已於二時十五分飛返機塲，曾往無錫惠山一帶探尋，亦無所獲。按失踪客機係第卅一號平滬班機，十三日（星期五）搭乘旅客並載運鈔票來滬。常日在京歇夜，十四日午後二時由京飛滬，起飛卅分鐘後，曾與途中另一客機通無綫電話，詢及遺留在京之皮包一隻。四十五分鐘後，京滬兩地航空站即不再接獲其無綫電訊，遍呼不應，遂吿失踪。該機正駕駛員馬發祥，副駕駛員張樹東，俱爲有經騐之飛行人員。據航空界人士觀察，原因當在十四日整”惡劣之氣候，駕駛員可能因雲低雨密，降低高度飛行，致在某處觸山。故昨日出發搜索之二專機，擇定蘇錫一帶山嶺爲目標。該公司對失踪客機可能被迫降落）點，迄未放棄希望，仍在盡最大努力尋覓中，冀人機仍能安全歸來。</p>

<h3 id="c104">創於同治六年歷史悠久　江南造船所積極復興　設備現代化管理周密　慘淡經營已成爲中國最大船廠 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在這工業落後的中國，一切重工業器材都要仰給於外國，而海軍江南造船所，雖然目前遝不能造出什麽「伊利撒白皇后」號來，但它不但能給中國自已，還可代外國造船，這的確可以使我們揚眉吐氣一下！誰都知道美商大來輪船公司總統號船隻，聞名全球，在中國的航業史上居有極高的地位，然而大槪很少人知道在民國九年的時候，他們新添的四條一萬噸重的大輪船，却是我們的江南造船所爲他們造的。</p>
<p>首次歐戰代美造船</p>
<p>江南造船所創辦在同治六年，那時還在提　橋辦公，後經製造局撥現在高昌廟塲地一部份爲船塢，民初改名海軍江南造船所，當時設備非常簡陋。一九一四年第一次歐戰發生，得美國撥款囑造四條一萬噸大船，至一九二〇年造成移交大來公司，後來就把盈餘擴充浩船所，接着又替美海軍造了六條砲船。該所所長馬德驥於民國十六年到所主持，於十九年離所，二十二年又入所，抗戰後於民國三十三年秋，和其他二十餘位工程師赴美參加美海造船廠服務，硏究年餘返國重入該所，其最大目的，乃在擴充江南造船所，使成爲一現代化的造船廠。經過馬所長在美多方交涉，結果山中美雙方訂的，供給該所設備材料共値美』金一千萬元，這一批物資，已運到的有三分之一，其餘都在陸續運華中，在六個月以後，金部配備都可　就。至於償還辦法，係分三十年付淸，每年償還三十分之一，但並不以款項付還，而將代浩船隻工作勞力償還。</p>
<p>船塢三處員工五千</p>
<p>造船所在上海淪陷　間，被敵佔據，破壞殆盡，並將兵工廠毀掉，擴充地盤，因此該所接收時所有地共計五百畝，較戰前反多了一倍。但機件廠房祗有損失而無增添，目前因爲經費有限，祗能逐漸恢復，但記者們參觀各處辦公地點已感到規模之宏大而且整齊。</p>
<p>內部組織分：（一）總務處，（二）設計處，（三）生產處，（四）人事室。設備方面有船塢三處，五〇〇呎長七八呎寬的，可容一萬噸重船，五七五呎長七八呎寬的，可容一萬五至二萬噸重船，六二呎長一百呎寬的，可容三萬噸重船。其他如電氣廠，冷工廠，電焊工廠，輪機廠，翻砂廠等，都齊備並將擴充。所內會計處設備尤爲近代化，內備國際商業機器，在中國是獨有的二家中之一，可節省三分之二的人力。所內員工人數共五千五百多名，包括按術人員三七九名，工人四，八八二名，尙有士兵等，美工程師有七名，英二名，日入一名是電機工程師，將於本年年底辭去，另有女職員二十多名負責文書方面工作。</p>
<p>生產力強重視福利</p>
<p>該所生產能力相常堅强，一萬噸的船，一年內可造三隻，同時可造其他小船。沿海用船在二千至三千噸者一年能造十餘艘，同時兼造行駛內江船隻。內河行船一百至一千噸者：每年可造三十艘，兼造報船，駁船鋼鐵工程等。這一年來所修造大小船雙，包括外國海軍或商用的共計五八二艘，目前正在修的有七三艘，在造的四一艘。</p>
<p>員工的管理和福利，都非常井井有條。馬所長希望員工們視廠如家，建立密切關係，同時使他們生活安定。所內有閱覽室，經濟中西食堂，理髮室，浴室，洗衣作，縫衣室。祗是宿舍頗成問題，現有宿舍僅能容一百多人，在一二星期內將動工興建一大宿舍，可供二千餘名工人住。部內設備亦儘量求其完善。爲了補助員工生活計，所內設消費合作社，婚喪，生育，敎育補助金。工人的工資按生活指數，底薪按民二十六年計，佔計最低工價每日六千元，最高一萬八千元。工人每日工作時間，自上午八時至下午五時。每日報到都依照美國工廠新制，領薪有中國銀行特設之辦事處。</p>
<p>參觀修船工程浩大</p>
<p>此外學徒們在工作完畢後給予披術訓練，資格是小學畢業後參加訓練班四年，畢業後爲五級工匠。學徒們供給衣食住並另外津貼。</p>
<p>記者們昨日承馬所長招待，由單韻湘及黄履等數位工程師領導參觀，並詳加解釋。船塢巾正在修船，工程十分浩火，據吿修船費用，進塢費係按照噸電計算，每噸八百元，第一日停塢實收，第二日以後則按半數，其他修理費，機件裝配等另行計費。記者們走了很多路，參觀了相當多廠房作塲，據說還祗是一部份。據所內職員說，要全部參觀視察一番，至少化上三個鐘點。</p>
<p>江南造船所吾中國最大的造船所，在抗戰以後建國正在開始一的時候，我們對於這樣一所國家的珍寶該多麼的重視！我們期望看它一步步的擴大起來，爲我國的工業爭光！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市府最近接奉行政院訓令，內開：「查人民守土傷亡撫卹實施辦法所定卹金標準，自該辦法頒行以來，其間僅三十二年提高一次，按五倍發給。衡諸目今物價，確屬杯水車薪，有重加修訂之必要。茲據河南省政府請求提高上項標準到院，經交據內政·財政二部讖復，並提經本年十月份本院第七六二次會議決議：卹金標準可由各省政府自行斟酌辦理。至於此項卹金經費，現以財政收支系統改制，應由省預算統籌，除轉報國防最高委員會備查並分行外，合行令仰遵照」。市府人事處於接獲上述訓令後，即斟酌本巿物價實際情形，以食米時價爲準，照原訂標準提高一千二百五十倍。</p>
<p>三十二年提高一次</p>
<p>查人民守土傷亡撫卹辦法，係於民國二十七年公佈，其中規定人民因守土傷亡者，可得一次卹金八十元，年卹金五十元。一等受傷者（如兩目皆盲者等），可得一次卹金七十元，年卹金四十元。二等受傷者（如一手或一足殘廢者），可得一次卹金六十元，年卹金三十五元。三等受傷者（如聾一耳者或鼻脫落者等），可得一次卹金四十元，年卹三十元，上列卹金標準曾於三十二年提高一次，按五倍發給，其時最高卹金，一次可得國幣四百元，年卹可得二百五十元。若以當時米價折合，則其一次卹金約可抵食米二石，年卹的可抵食米一石二斗五升。</p>

<p>此後物價迭有升漲，衡諸目前情形，米價約已較之卅二年超出二百五十倍奇，（最近食米價格的爲每担五萬元），亦即等於民國二十八年之一千二百五十倍，故調整本巿卹金標準，擬參酌最近食米價格，照實施辦法原訂金額，槪予提高一千二百五十倍。例如因保衛村鎭而傷亡者，其原訂之一次卹金爲八十元，提高一千二百五十倍後，即可得一次卹金十萬元，（仍合食米二石）。其年卹金原訂爲五十元，提高後可得六萬二千五百元。（仍合食米一石二斗五升）。</p>

<h3 id="c112">上海典當業 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>上海雖是金融中樞，銀行錢莊比任何地方來得多，可是大都與平民無緣。祇有典當纔是他們可通有無的地方，所謂「典當乃窮人的娘舅家」，是很確當的。</p>
<p>上海又爲胃險家的樂園，投機罪惡的淵　，家庭之盛義，個人事業之成敗，瞬息萬變，於是典當業乃應運而生。年來生活程度高漲，小巿民與薪水階級，皆入不敷出，想和親友們去借嗎？在世態炎涼的今日，人情冷酷，誰來解囊援手。惟有身上僅存的衣服，可以送人典當中去換幾個錢。雖然期限短，利息高，飲鴆止渴的下策，但在生計煎迫之下，那裏還有比這個區法呢？</p>
<p>因此這種舊式的鄉村金融機關——典當，佈滿在上海每一條街上，像姻紙店一樣的普過。但眞正够得上典當兩字的，却又如鳳毛麟角，大都高利盤剝，吸貧民的血液。照過去的規定，典當要領到部帖，纔能營業，即是現在，也必須先向主管機關請登記，在未取得登記證以前，是不能營業的。至於定期長短，取息高低，也都有嚴格的限制。所以開典當的，須先備鉅大的資金。</p>
<p>典當的標幟</p>
<p>典當本算是一種高尙總是最大的，堅牆厚壁，高深莫測，假使沒有那個斗大的「當」字，一定給人錯認爲衙門。大門裏面，還放着一架木板屏風，隔開內外。因爲當東西是一件不體面的事情，屏風把內部遮掩了，免得外人一望而知。但現在上海，當店星羅棋佈，却小得可憐，大都祇有一間。在同行競爭之下，門口裝了霓虹燈，黄昏深夜，放出炫耀的光彩，好像在那裏向人招手，又好像給予顧客一種諷刺。有的佈置櫥窗，陳列着許多朱寶首飾，那都是滿期待沽的死貨。在商業中心的上海，典當已一反過去莊嚴的態度，而十足地商業化了。</p>
<p>典當的櫃臺，往往比其他商店的來得高，貧民站在高櫃台之下，仰起了頭，還不能十分看得淸櫃台上的東西。這高櫃台與朝奉的面容，氣燄萬丈，很足以欺侮那般可憐的貧民。櫃台前又密密排着些鐵欄干，隔着欄干做交易。一開間的小押常，櫃台前祇留着很小的一塊面積，往往小得不能使顧客轉身</p>
<h3 id="c113">徽州帮和潮汕帮 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>上海經營典當的都是徽州人，那時銀行還在萌芽時期，中等階級以下的人，和錢莊沒有往來，遇到經濟困難的時候，就拿東西去當，以濟燃眉之急，以此貧民莫不認爲唯一之救星，當店獲利，自是意料中事，旣而潮汕人，亦相繼開設典當。但鑒於徽州典當的限期過長，非有大量資本不可，於是召創小押當，縮短期限。小押當的營業，日漸展開，無形中造成了另一局面。於是滬地典當業，有一時期，竟爲潮汕與徽州兩幫所獨佔。後來本地人也利用他們龐大的游資，參加此業，大有後來居上之勢，潮汕和徽州兩幫，反過時而後退了。</p>

<p>典當爲財物匯聚之所，故易爲盜賊所覬覦，一遇變亂，典當往往先受其殃。亂平之後，一片瘡　，典當又開始調劑民生。故典業興衰，與治亂頗有關聯。當淸季洪楊之亂，滬地典當，受刧慘重，所存無幾。亂事旣定，地方有司，乃設立公典，以濟刧後餘生，許多民營典當，大致亦遵循公典規章開設。小押當本租界上之特殊產物，自京滬路通車後，閘北巿面漸興，小押當逐漸出現。民國以來，拆除縣城，改築馬路，小押當又侵入南市。在典當業最盛時期，全滬有大典當八十餘家小押當五百餘家。其後世界經濟恐慌的狂潮，進襲上海，許多典當也遭遇同樣的命運，年年虧折，先後倒閉不少，至抗戰發生前，所存已不滿二百家了。</p>
<p>「八一三」的烽火，使大家紛紛到前租界內來避難，生計窘迫，祗得藉典質以度日，典當業因又繁榮起來，新設典當日多，最多在一千家以上。勝利後，有不少已關門停業了，但向社會局登記的，還有九百餘家。但現在拆息甚高，再加上繁重的捐稅，高利貸的典當，也有無法維持之苦。同時社會購買力又薄弱，所抵押的東西，滿期以後，亦不易銷售。看來這典當業已漸漸地走向下坡去了。</p>
<h3 id="c115">黑店式的剝削平民 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>過去正式典當，規定十八個月滿期，期滿寬放五天，利息則按月一分八釐至二分，另加百分之一的「存箱」是歸職員們分潤的。其後潮汕帮經營典業因無巨額週轉資金，十縮短期限至六個月或八個月。其實上海自開埠以後，繁華所趨，競向時髦，安放在典當中的衣服，在一年半後，早已不合時了，尤其是婦女的服裝，無時無刻不變。所以滿期後的陳腐衣服，不易變價。過去出賣滿期貨尙有三四成利息可圖，後來却成反比利，每一千須虧蝕二三百元，所以大典常也逐漸將期限縮短。改爲十二個月。小押店則從六個月減至四個月。</p>
<p>至於利率，過去除大典當仍按照規定外，小押典大致分爲三級，三　以上者二分，二元以上者三分，一元以下者高至四分五釐。當本愈小，取利愈重，甚至以十日爲一期，每期取息三分者，則按月達九分矣。</p>
<p>抗戰發生後，租界情形特殊，許多經營典當業者，爲所欲爲，期限縮短至二個月或一個月，利息高至五六角之譜，另設棧租佣金等名目，更有十日一期，以複利計算者，亦有預扣利息者，總之利之所在，竭盡剝削之能事。所謂調劑民生，早已名不副實。勝利後雖加限制，規定兩個月滿期，利息按月二角七分，棧租四分，手續費一角五角，共計第一月須四角六分，第二月三角一分。利息如此之高，貧民已不勝負重。而在典當方面，，則又以拆息高，開支大，營業尙不易維持？如何能去解除那高物價壓迫下之民生疾苦呢？</p>
<h3 id="c116">朝奉的臉色 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>當走進當中，去典質衣物時，在高櫃台下，先得要看「朝奉」的顏色。任何一件東西送上了這高櫃台，就要靠朝奉來決定它的身價，普通按照原價打上一個六折。貨物價格一經批定，便不輕易更改，顧客雖再三哀求，決不會打動朝奉的心，有時或竟加以　刺或嘲笑。這是一而的賣買，顧客們站在高櫃台下，好似一隻被宰割的羔羊，即使失望，而至痛心，也只能忍受、絕無討價還價的餘地。</p>
<p>朝奉雖具有無上權威，但責任也很重。他們有精細的鑑別能力，簡直是部萬寶全書。衣服的估價，當然不在話下，就是金銀，珠寶，鐘錶，照相機等，也非內行不可，有時顧客送上一件很古怪的東西來，必須在最短時間內，鑑別估價。不過在過去認爲最難評定的書畫古玩，現在已幾乎一沒有上當舖的了。些錢，相反地中國衣服在虹口當店裏，估價也往往比別處低·女人衣服，式樣變得太快，滿期的旗袍，在式樣上，時令上，都賣不起好價錢的。</p>
<p>最初，賣死貨的利息雖不及取贖的利息高，但總可以賺些錢，大的比當本多三四成。後來成爲反比例，不僅不能賺錢，還要虧去十分之二三的血本，這是典當業最衰落的一個時期。抗戰發生後，大家經濟困難，沒有錢去買新貨，故典當內滿期的舊衣，出路非常之好。近幾年來物價日夜高漲，在當裏放了二個月的舊衣服，市價反已比二個月前爲高，何况當時估價，祇及市價的二三折呢。因此賣死貨的虧耗，在目前典當中，已無所用其顧慮了。即抄失舉，開明日期，衣物質料色樣後，印發界內各當。朝奉接到了這「閻王單」，便應查對當簿，有無相同或近似之物，有則檢出，候捕房吊去，給失主認明。各捕房有專跑典當的探員，拿了手摺，往各家查詢，如有則呈報吊看無則在摺子上蓋一本當　柬圖章，名謂「敲印子」。若巳敲過印子，而盜賊供出當質的地方是你，捕房就要依法控訴，非但當本充公，還要拘役罰款。若是自動繳出，經失生認明後，捕房調查當本，判給本息。</p>
<p>從前典押業和兩租界警務處合作已久，而法領事忽頒布典當管理條文，令警務處嚴密實施。規定當舖應查明典質人的姓名職業及地址，並須覓得保證人。捕房</p>
<h3 id="c117">談當票 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>當你把衣服送進當舖時，除換得一點錢外，還有一張當票給你，道即日後取贖的憑證，一張薄薄的桑皮紙，不但印刷糢糊不淸，就是所開物件及價格，也像道士畫符一樣，一個字也不認識。　據說當票上的字，是從「十七帖」中化出來的，大都祗有半個字，也有由內行所公認的別字。道種字稱爲當體，又呌做徽字，外行人是看不懂的。　當票上的字不僅看不懂，同時所開的品質又和原物並不一致。明明是一只金手錶，他們總寫「壞銅手錶」。凡是金銀銅鐵五金等件，必是「壞」字開頭，衣服則都加上「破碎」兩字，皮貨則件件是「虫蛀」過的。</p>
<p>當票上道種寫法，完全是一面之辭，十足表現過去封建社會，地主對付佃農的方式。但典當的信用很好，充分具有中國商業上的舊道德，雖然好的寫成壞的，到取贖時決不掉包。可是在「世風日下」的今日，那固定的舊道德，已不能維持。這種神秘的符號，正可以使他們施展其各樣的陰謀詭計。貧民們除受高利貸剝削外，還要擔心遭受意外的損失。</p>
<h3 id="c118">死貨的出路 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>典質之物，期滿如不　取，則可解息轉期、若旣不贖取，又不轉期，則稱爲死貨，由當舖出售變賣。普通當店所收貨物，以衣服爲大宗，首飾次之，木器和其他日用品，並不每家都收。這種死貨，除木器等由門巿脫手外，首飾則向銀極兌現，衣服劃給衣莊。石路上許多估衣店，都是他們的主顧。衣服估價，以西裝和旗袍爲最不値錢。一套西裝估不到市價的一二成，旗袍更賤到十分之一以下。因爲西裝的出路祇靠吳淞路的舊西裝店來買，所以西裝拿到虹口去，可以多當</p>
<h3 id="c119">「止當候贖」 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>民國三十一年的夏天，前法租界典押業曾發生過一度風潮，每一家當店門口，都貼上一張「同業通知，止當候贖」，或「暫停營業」的紅紙條兒。這和小市民息息相關的押當，一旦總勸員停業，於是等米下鍋的人，立刻便覺得走頭無路。雖然前公共租界的當舖仍開着鬥，只要挾了衣服，多跑些路，仍能抵押得幾個錢來買柴　米，可是已引起了許多小布民的騷動。</p>
<p>典當爲盜賊銷贓之所，朝奉們偶一疏忽，就不免因被紫而吃「夾檔」凡捕房接獲失主報吿後，隨時派員調查，如尋出原贓，逕由警務處沒收，並處典當主人以收贓之罪。此項辦法，典當業認爲太苛，有動輒獲咎之苦。於是全體停業，止當候贖。道一塲小小風潮，歷時凡兩日。其後法租界當局允修改條文，才吿平息。</p>
<h3 id="c120">市立公典 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>時代潮流在轉變，正式典當已不能存在，反使許多黑心的小押店，趨於活躍。原爲調劑民生的福利事業，却都變爲盤剝重利的吸血虫。巿政府爲便利貧民典質，防止高利貸起見，設立了三處公典，嘉惠貧民，　非淺鮮。</p>
<p>典當旣是一種救濟貧民的社會事業，本應由公家來辦理。上海自洪楊亂後，瘡痍滿目，民生凋疲，於是設立典當，以調劑刦後的貧民，其資金由省庫指撥，亦屬公典性質。後因公款不敷，乃責成地方縉紳籌措，漸漸有民營典當出現，但仍不失其救濟意義。迨後小押當與起，大當舖又因期限過長而不易立足，遂變爲剝削貧民之利刃，形成小押當獨霸之局面。</p>
<p>市立公典之設，在民國二十四年，即有此議，因資金無法籌措，故未成立。勝利後的上海，經八年來敵寇的搜括，奸偽的敲詐，大多數市民，均患着極深的「乾血癆」，藉典質度日的人，不知凡幾。於是輔助平民經濟之公典，居然在高利貸環境之下成立了，實在是一件大可欣慰之事。</p>
<p>市立公典有三處：（一）在南市方浜路露香園路口，（二）在成都路廿二號，（三）在勞勃生路曹家渡三角塲。每家由市庫撥給資本金三百萬元，並由市銀行分別與各典訂立透支一千萬元的契的，使其資金格外充足。至於公典經常開支一，則由市府撥給，管理全歸社會一局。公典規定月息二分，並無存箱和棧租等費，祗付一次手續費，每元五分。期限三個月，期滿得寬放三十天，實等於四個月。最初規定每戶最高當額爲三千元，然在物價狂漲的今日，三千元之數，不能使窮苦的老百姓，發生興趣，後經社會局基准市政府、改爲一萬元。</p>
<p>公典開幕時，利息低得使人不敢相信。貧民挾了衣服，一湧而來，資本三百萬元，沒有幾天，已經給他們完全「沙蟹」了。幸而有市銀行所透支一千萬元，否則幾乎無法營業。所當的東西，大都是衣服。按公典規定，制服軍裝，金石書畫，木器傢具，田單獎據，逮禁物品，以及無從估價的希罕東西，都不能當，如過形跡可疑，來路不明之物，亦得拒絕。貧民除衣服之外，本來身無長物，方今隆冬天氣，即那件僅有的破棉襖，也還不能脫下來，送進「長生庫」中去呀。</p>
<p>公典顧客，大多以工人，小販和失業貧民爲主。曹家渡的公典，位於工廠區域，來當者自以工人爲最多。南市方浜路公典，小販佔第一位。成都路的顧客，則爲失業貧民。營業比較起來，賈家渡居首，方浜路决之，成都路最差。貸出款項，三處均已超過資金三百萬元。</p>
<p>公典原爲貧民而設，所以利率定得很低。市府防有不肖的小押店，暗中吸收資本，故禁止其將所當各物，再向公典轉押。如經查明，私將貨物轉押，除將所當各物沒收外，並得呈請社會局追繳當價利息，嚴懲不貸。</p>
<h3 id="c121">賭場旁邊的典當 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>賭徒們輸錢是不會覺悟的，當他們把賭本輸光了的時候，出會拿身上衣服去當錢，希望翻本，最後再把當票去當錢，孤注一擲。所以賭塲附近的當店，正和風化區中的花柳醫生一樣，乃是因地制宜的產物。</p>
<p>過去在敵偽時期，號稱一歹土」的滬西一帶，賭塲林立，於是便利賭客的特種典當，亦多如雨後春筍。他們大都祇有一間門面，顧客當然以賭徒爲主。所當衣服，遠沒有當票來得多，至於金銀首飾，在賭塲內便可以抵用，更是絕跡了。</p>
<p>上海的小押當，可算是黑心之至，但賭塲隣近的當店，所定條件之狠，更出人意外。普通値一元的當票，祇能當一角錢，衣服等物，估價也要比別家更不値錄。利息是每角三分，五天滿期，不贖就要變賣。</p>
<p>此處典當，利息之高，已連極點（那時上海普通利率選是很低）。同時因爲估價旣低，即使不贖，把東西變賣出去，也很有一筆錢可廉。本輕利重，無以復加，眞是「吃人」的塲合。　賭徒們沉溺於贈塲之中，執途不悟，錢轍了拿東西去當，當來的錢又輸了，再拿當票去當。所以賭塲附近的典當，門庭若市，戶限爲穿，生意着實不惡！</p>
<h3 id="c122">代客贖當的內幕 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>上海有幾家小押當，除了典押衣服貨物而外，可以把當票去當。「張値十元的當票，大致可當一元，利息是每角三分，以三角爲一單位，五天爲一期。不贖即行變賣，利息滿九分者，作一角計。這種苛刻條件，令人吃驚。假使一張票面一元的當票，當了一角錢，隔五天去贖，就要兩角了。因爲當本一角作三角計息，九分利息又升爲一角。同時當票上的數字，本來只有貨價的三折四折，現在再打個一折，就是不來贖，無論如何總是可以賺錢的。這種名爲典當，實乃黑店。</p>
<p>這種抵押當票</p>
<p>的方式，漸漸隨着社會而演改，產生了一種「代客贖當」的新事業。代客贖當者所注意的是金銀有飾等貴重東西，因爲當舖收當這類東西最高不會超過原價百分之六十，到期時，持票人若不能備款取贖，又無款付息展期，不是眼睜睜地望着那當舖僅以百分之六十的代價將他的東西奪了去嗎！代客贖當就是來做個居間人，暫時墊一筆款子，將東西贖了出來，然後再從兌換上獲取一點利益，在持票人方面，也是樂以負擔的。</p>
<p>據說代客贖當是金神父路打浦橋一家陸天寳銀樓的主人想出來的，繼之而起者風起雲湧，一時新開了幾十家似是而非的銀樓，都是以代客贖當爲唯一業務。雖然說是以墊款的方式，來博取什費若干成，車馬費若干成，等到贖了出來之後，在金予上還要打個折扣，每兩金價，總比市價壓低數十元，此時已「羊入虎口」，祇得徒呼負負而已。他們在一轉手聞，所獲利息，大有可觀。所以經營代客贖當者，莫不利市三倍，那首創的一家，早已積資累萬了。</p>
<p>假使一張當票</p>
<p>代爲贖出之後，主客之間，因價格相去太遠，不能成交，那末可用其他補救方法：（一）將贖出的金飾，仍送當舖典質，儘可能把常價比原當價提得更高一些，當常票則由該店保存，出立收據，的期由物主償付餘款，過期則由該店取贖，以償損失。（二）如係鑽石珠　等，則持往珠寶店估價，而定成交價格。若所估價格，該店認爲發生疑問時，則可任顧客出售，該店僅在售後取回墊本而已。這些完密的條件，不得不使人驚異。然利雖可圖，而携帶貴重飾物，鉅額款項，在路上往返，也頗有幾分危險性。</p>
<p>代客贖當事業興起後，一般典當中的朝奉都受到很大的打擊。原來典當中的滿期貨，規定由銅錫舖及提莊負責承銷。但貨價若低於當本，則其損失由劃價之朝奉賠償，其中金銀首飾等，却永無虧損賠貼之處，故朝奉必種種設法，勿使「沒」掉，逾期不贖，即可從中取利。代客贖當之風旣盛，朝奉對於此項盈利，無從染指，於是羣謀報復，暗中將飾物常價提高，對代贖商人來取時，輒先言明贖後不得再以原價當入。因此代客贖當，常遇「偷鷄勿着蝕把米」之事。此一幕朝奉與代贖商火拚事，使貧民乞靈於「長生庫」者反得略收漁人之利。</p>
<p>代客贖當，前工部局認爲可替盜賊闢一銷贓之新途徑，曾明令取締，於是先後停業。但此種商舖，大都以經營金銀珠寶爲幌子，較大者櫥窗中陳列各種飾物，宛如銀樓，雖不敢公然營業，但暗中仍頗沾動。</p>
<p>尙有一種</p>
<p>外面掛着「××商行」的招牌，表面上像是一家舊貨舖，但亦兼營「收買當票」的事業。凡大典當的常票，所當者爲較貴重的東西，像照相機自來水筆等，他們都有收買，所出代價，只有當票的十之二三。此種貨物，其常價普通是貨價的三四成，若再加上收買費用，僅合到貨價的百分之五六十。他們收買了當票，將貨物續出後，略加修理，或再翻新，就可以待善價而沽之，獲利也很豐厚。</p>
<h3 id="c123">一家最富麗的典當 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>貧民佈滿於全世界每一個角落裏，號稱「平民恩物」的典當，也任何地方都有，倒不是我國的特產。這一家世界最當麗的典當，不在最富有的美洲，也不在有歷史的歐洲，而在南美洲的阿根廷的國都所在地。</p>
<p>在阿京的巿中心，有一幢很精緻的五樓大厦，美麗的橱窗，整齊的半圓形櫃合，佈置得有條不紊。門口揭示着Casa　de　Vantas幾個字。初臨阿京的人必定會指着問，這是不是一家百貨商店？其實那是一家由市政府所管理的典當，可說是世界上最富麗的典當了。這樣大的典當，市民出人其間，就像走進銀行一樣，大模大樣，毫無愧</p>
<p>這所典當，收受任何東西，貸款亦無限制。他曾收下鑽石一粒，抵款達十二萬披索之巨。又曾收下飛機一架，其後不得不以十元代價售出。目前受典縫衣機達一萬具，鋼琴達二千五百架，其他如望遠鏡，結婚禮服等也很多，至於結婚戒指，那是非到山窮水盡的時候，不肯出典的了。案</p>
<p>在大厦的轉角處，爲估價室，那裏一天到晚，出入的人，川流不息。市民走進估價室，在一小間中坐候，由職員將待質物件拿進去，給估價員估價，質物原主和估價員是不準面晤的，因爲恐怕他們勾結。估價完畢，質物者便携款而去，決不爭多嫌少，蓋當中所付代價，必較其他私家當舖所付爲多也。</p>
<p>典質物品滿期後，便採取公開方式拍賣。橱窗裏分別陳列着整套餐具，椅桌，各式無綫電，打字處，圖畫和樂器等等，上面附有小籲，註明號碼和最低標價？你若不能親自到塲購取，則祇須繳付五分的手續費和百分之二十的保證金，拍賣時便會有人替你代辦。顧客價如想買某種東西，而沒有看見陳列出來，那末只須留下姓名和電話號碼，等這種物品出售時，再來通知你。此種服務精神，可謂無微不至。</p>
<p>他們對於物主，也盡力服務。質物出售後，所得利潤，除扣去應繳息金外，仍將餘款交還原主。也有典物後，仍按期付息已逾十年者。曾有某婦人典質鋼琴一架歷廿五年之久，最後，典當管理處竟決定將他交還原主。他們每年又將貧民所質的冬衣和毛毯，抽籤發還。這種忠實爲公衆服務的精神，實可令人欽佩，南美一帶人稱之謂「有良心之典當」，並非虛語。</p>
<p>他們又做了許多慈善事業，像一九三八年曾資助某醫院建造肺病療養室和門診室，以利貧病。此外並貸款給各城市，助其築路還債。一九三四年，貸予阿京市政府之款，共達二千萬披索之巨。</p>
<p>最後還得加以說明。外國一般典當，也設在陋巷，大都爲一開間汚穢不堪的小店，橱窗蕪亂已極，人們非至一　莫展，決不願輕易踏進其門。阿京的典當，乃是例外。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市電機絲織工業同業公會，近以會員貸款無門，而備受高利貸之盤剝。再以原料人工，而皆高昂。而產品則售價不振，不敷成本。目前已瀕於無法維持之階段。昨日下午一時，該會遂特假康樂酒家，召開臨時緊急會員大會，共商如何應付對策。出席市黨部王先靑，及社會局，工業協會滬分會，巿商會等機關代表，及該會會員，共達二百五六十人。大會由該會現事長蔡昕濤及常務理事劉慶一等主持。主席致開會詞後，嗣由各機關代表先後致詞，最後討論要案三起：（一）貸款問題，目前中交兩行，雖已對該業辦理低利貸款。惟該會會員能借到者，不過佔全體會員四分之一。且查該項貸款，須以原料成品七折作抵。而廠方端賴原料以生產，成品以銷售。今因作扺關係，竟需關入中交倉庫，致外人不明詳情者，尙以爲各廠一無存貨，而分起索欠。故獲得貨款結果，反遭貸款所逼倒。過去一週間，又有會員五六家宣吿淸理，情形殊屬嚴重。討論結果：決定籲請常局，改善貸款辦法。建議辦法爲每織機，發放貸款一千二百萬元。抵押品中一半爲製品及成品，另一半爲機器。借得款項，一半拔還高利貸舊欠，一半供購買原料之用。並決定推派蔡昕濤，劉慶一，宋保林，錢序葆，童莘伯，沈榮馥等廿人代表，於今明兩日，先向生產業臨時貸款委員會請願。如不得要領，全體會員三百卅餘人，將於本週三列隊分赴巿黨部，市政府，市社會局，及生產貸款委會等，分別請願。如仍不得要領，則代表廿人，將再携呈晋京向蔣主席，國民大會，行政院，經濟部，財政部，及四聯總處等，分別請願。如仍無結果，該業惟有出於全體歇業之一途，影饗所及，該業全體之二萬餘工人，將全部失業。（二）年賞問題：最近巿政會議開會時，討論件工資之年賞辦法，決定仍照過去情形辦理。茲以絲織業之情形言，過去並無年賞習慎。矧以本年情形特殊。會員申請貸款，尙無辦法，更無盈利之可言。且絲織業工人工資，每人平均月入多在卅萬元以上。果以每人要發給年賞一月爲準，則全體會員爲年賞而須支出之負担，常在三四十億元之間。以較大型廠言，擁有三百工人者，即須負祖一億元之鉅。處茲山窮水盡之時，何來餘力償付此額外之負担。故決定以該項實際情形，轉呈巿政府及社會局存照。（三）代織綢緞問題：目前政府取購之生絲，以成本高昂，且以日絲競爭關係，出口困難，且須虧蝕，絲織業有鑒及此，特向　係當局要求將該批收購之生絲，交由絲織業公會會員廠代織綢緞。蓋我國綢緞，在國際巿塲，銷路較佳，且售價亦較生絲有起色。預計織成綢緞後，輸出銷售所得之外匯，可較生絲增加一倍。現關係局原則上已予同意，決設促進實現。會議至五時許始告竣事。</p>

<p>— （本報編譯室譯自紐約午報）</p>
<p>一，目前物價的觀察</p>
<p>百物一致看漲　衣食兩項尤甚</p>
<p>雖然多數人預測美國物價將吿下跌，但是最近一星期內又發生了新的通貨膨脹。一般市民的生活費非但沒有降低，而且有繼續上漲之勢。在當局宣佈取消物價管制以後第一個星期內，大家侈談着物價趨跌的話，但事實所表現的是各項物價依然跳動不已。也許這是通貨膨脹的「回光反照」，可是它已經是登峯造極了。</p>
<p>本年九月美國的生活費比較一九三五至一九三九年的平均生活費高漲百分之四十六。官方雖還沒有公佈正確的數字，但今後的漲勢可能達到較戰前高漲百分之五十的程度。紐約的生活費比較其他各地爲高，而且上漲的速度也較大。　在本年初，紐約的生活費較全國高百分二·五，目前則較全國高百分之三·五。祇有房租一項漲得最少，使生活費略爲抑低。房租較一九三九年漲百分之二弱；燃料及其他住的費用的漲百分之十九；可是糧食較一三九年漲百分之九十；衣服漲百分之八十五；傢具漲百分之七十。　上列數字並沒有包括最近的漲價。在宣佈取消物價管制的最初兩天中，二十八種主要商品的價格漲起百分之七·四。漲勢最烈的是五金·碎鐵和化學原料。人造絲織物·生羊毛·地毯的價格均吿上漲。各大工廠出品的各種器械和收音機均創新高價，比較前一星期漲起百分之六十。奇異公司的洗衣機隔夜便飛漲百分之三十之鉅。他如汽車。農具等無一不受通貨膨脹的影響。</p>
<p>跌價的商品　有極少數的變種，而以兎起　落的棉價爲最顯著。皮貨自從今春以來已經跌價百分之三十至五十。其他跌價的商品尚有下面幾種：女式羊毛衫·男式運動衣·手帕和若干種牌子不出名的無綫電收音機。</p>
<p>物價高漲的結果，生活費超過了工人的工資。一九四六年一月平均每週工資爲四十一元一角五分，同年九月增至四十五元一角，但較之突飛猛進的生活費實覺瞠乎其後！</p>
<p>通貨膨脹的另一結果是儲蓄率的銳减。一九四四年美國全國人民每年能儲蓄三百九十億元，一九四五年僑商三百五十億元，但是一九四六年全國儲蓄總額减至一百七十億元。這就是說：許多美國人根本沒有節蓄，有的甚至吃盡當光，　台高築。</p>
<p>二，今後物價的展望</p>
<p>趨勢仍舊看漲　生活見艱難</p>
<p>在今後數月內，許多需要極殷的主要商品將再行漲價，勢所必然。下面是一個估計：　關於食物價格的最近展望是將較上週提高。肉類·奶油·和鷄蛋的價錢已經在上漲之中，以遠大的眼光看來，一九四七年內，你支付於食物的帳單恐無减低希望，要有也不過只是跟着季節稍有上落而已。　關於衣着，除了人造絲以外，各物價格大概已經公認漲足，聖誕節後且將有折扣及出淸陳貨之賤賣，明年春間，特別是女子服裝，價格將逐漸低落。即使是男子的衣着亦疲弱不振，西裝及襯衫已有幾種實行减價。</p>
<p>但是需要最爲迫切的家庭用具價格則將上漲，所調價錢便宜的傢具一項，據估計不久即將提高百分之三十。傢具漲價過程中的最大阻礙臨減低。大多數的人均將不能負担如此高價。</p>
<p>在各大汽車製造商中，祗有通用汽車公司一家已將其出品價格提高，其他各公司則謂如果原料價格不增高則決不漲價。但原料價格從那時起已在提高中。</p>
<p>房租及建　物價格之高勝爲今日生活費用上最大之威脅，物價管理局現正考慮業主請求將房租提高百分之十五之　文，該呈並規定逐漸解除房租制辦法。關於住宅，供給退伍軍人的新屋現價一萬元，政府發言人亦已不再認爲可能，一所標準式六個房間的木架房屋價格已漲至一萬三千美元。住宅價格與將來如有减落亦必自較舊較大的住宅開始，小住宅仍必需要迫切而售價昂貴，至少在一九四八年以前情形必定如此。</p>

<p>— 七日開封航訊　本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>今年過的是貪汚年，混水摸魚，大官小官都自動的把服務道德那一撕了去，人人都在捉換着如何利用職務上的便利，找機會弄錢。澄淸吏治，剷除貪汚這口號，早已被貪汚舞弊的聲浪壓了下去，羣魔亂舞，今年的官塲到處是烏姻療氣啊！時値　末，我們悲痛焦急的心情，恨不得立刻把這幾頁殘餘的舊日撕去，展開光明的明天，使我們的筆永遠不再刻畫像今年官塲這樣的汚濁醜劇，而使她以鮮艷的色調去描繪光明的圖畫，我們祈待着，我們希望　！但是，事實上我們不能放下手中的筆，放過汚濁的現實，現在我仍然執着筆以痛苦的心情，給讀者寫河南醜劇的第二幕，這也許是最後的「幕，因爲年盡月除，「貧汚年」快過完了。</p>
<p>軍糧價款人人愛　不看前車秖圖才</p>
<p>轟動河南的方城軍糧價款舞弊案，所有暫幣經過和主角趙作安配角樊作民等被撤職扣押情形，記者業已在上月廿五“在本報向讀者詳細報　導過了，這個案子，從趙樊等一干人犯被扣押以後，社會人士都把眼光注意到政府如何　懲趙　方面去了，想不到從賊　裏打吐出來的軍糧價款，在匯往方城中，又失踪了。省方一等要人的　政局長樊作民，方城縣太爺趙作安等都爲此案被撤職扣押了，竟然還有人敢在這批款上打主意，而且私用該款再作陶朱事業，這個人的心狠胆大，就可想而知了，公務員服務道德淪喪至此，也就眞値得我們驚訝了！所以說這個案子濃含着—　劇性是一點不錯的。　緣方城軍糧價款一萬萬二千九百萬元，除薛斌卿私提一千九百萬元，暗作非法經營外，下餘　作民所搗鬼之一萬萬一千萬元，經方城縣參議會秘書孫魯瞻，前田糧科長朱文彬，靑年團幹事袁子玉等到省追究，樊作民手忙脚亂，各方張羅結果，算是由省銀行將這　款匯往許昌八千萬，襄縣葉縣各一千萬，餘一千萬連同許襄葉各分行根款單，一併由樊作民交該代表孫魯瞻等帶回。按道理講，孫等應當把各分行領款手續帶回方城覆命，由縣派員分往各分行提款，可是他們沒完全照這樣做，要不，這醜劇第二幕，就不能續和讀者見而了。　孫魯瞻等眼看着軍糧價款業已匯走，他們就啓程返里，這時候此案已轟動遐邇，他們已知道趙縣長作安已被撤職，新縣長剛剛到差，新舊交替，自然需要一個時間，他們路過許昌的時候，竟把匯到許昌分行八千萬元支票交給了許昌分行出納主任孫凌雲，（係孫魯瞻的侄兒）除孫魯瞻留許昌外，朱袁二人就回去了。他們剛走，趙縣長作安就被扣解省，孫凌雲在趙縣長被解過許之日，（十月九日）就將該款八千萬元悉數領出，以甲種活期存款，暫存裕記名下，然後以十分息貸於放許昌義利成茶莊五百萬，久　　　二千　　公司　　　膩百萬，另在　鹽菸　　囤菸葉二千萬，下餘一千萬，孫凌　自己留用。這套把戲，神不知，鬼不覺，在暗地里，他叔侄頗躊躇滿志。</p>
<p>孫魯瞻被扣解省　追回現款五千萬</p>
<p>十月二十三日孫魯瞻回到了方城，但出他意外的，就是王縣長敬修在十月廿五日推派代表袁子王等到許昌領款去了，他很驚慌焦急，乃又在十月二十九日倉卒赴許，向袁子玉等百般懇求，請勿聲張，經與袁等籌商結果，由孫魯瞻代袁等擬一電稿致王縣長，以款不到期爲由，請求王縣長准將原貸款收據帶回，企圖緩追。電發後，孫即於十一月一日又匆匆返縣運用，當晚即晋見王縣　　　　　　　所請王縣長一面口頭答應，而以時已下班，辦稿人員均不在無法覆電相推却，一面即將軍　款二次失踪案經過情形，密電省府，同時派人將襄葉兩處各一千萬元安然領回，並嚴追許昌之八千萬元，未幾，奉省府令將有關人犯解省，至此孫魯瞻乃被扣押解到開封，孫凌雲也被撤　扣押，現正在解省途中，那八千萬元軍價款，聽說只追回了五千五百萬現款，下餘兩千五百萬元則以菸葉和紙姻作抵了。</p>
<p>孫魯瞻解省後，就被扣押，聞曾被傳訊一次，據供稱該款係由朱文彬將提款單交孫凌雲，舞弊情形，彼均不知，惟據朱文彬供稱，他一點也不知通，袁子王也不知道，勾結舞弊，那只有孫家叔侄明白。</p>

<p>— 成都七日航訊　本報駐榮記者周學端</p>
<p>川省敎育，夙稱發達，自漢時文翁守蜀，普施敎化，創設學校，昌明文敎，蜀山風氣大開，當時蜀學之盛，比於齊魯，繁衍二千餘年，四川敎育在中國西部各省，始終居領導地位。八年抗戰，中樞西移，國內大學紛紛遷川，川省敎育蓬勃一時，蔚爲全國文化敎育之中心。勝利以後，敎育復員，川省敎育在復員後之現况，深爲合國人士所注意，記者爲此，特走訪川省敎育廳長劉明揚先生，作一席長談，劉氏綜諭復員後四川教育現况與今後敎育工作方針諸問題綦詳，供教育界參考。</p>
<p>復員以來　川省教育</p>
<p>首先談到目前四川敎育概况，從三個階段說起：戰前四川敎育有量而無質，高等敎育雖有四川，華西，重慶三大學，困於經費，素質甚差。中等敎育，較爲普遍，社愈與國民敎育均不甚發達，此爲四川敎育啓蒙時期·戰時國內大學紛紛內遷，極盛時四川共有廿八所大學，如重慶有中央政治學校　　央，復旦，中華五大學，樂山有武漢大學及中央技專，三台有東北大學，敍永有西南聯大硏究院，萬縣有上海法學院，江津有女子師範學院等。而成都當時擁有四川，華西，齊魯，燕京，金陵，光華，金陵女大，中大翳學院，川康農工學院九大學，號稱全國文化城·同時中等與社會國民三敎育，亦應時代與事實需要，進步一日十里，這是四川敎育繁榮時期·　勝利以後，學校復員，川省敎育由戰時繁榮而　感凋零，但是由於過去川省敎育基礎的根深蒂固，與抗戰迄今中央曁地方政府的扶植努力，使四川敎育進入第三階段，即現時的發揚時期，目前四川敎育槪况，本年度統計，高等敎育：專科以上共十三校，內大學四校，獨立學院三校，專科六校，分佈計成都有國立四川大學（校長黄季陸），私立華西（校長方叔　，成華大學（前光華大學留川改組，校長王兆榮），與川康　工學院（校長魏時珍），及省立會計，體育，藝術三專科學校，重慶有國立重慶大學（校長張洪沅），省立敎育學院（院長顏欲），及國立中央工專，扛津有國立女子師範學院（院長謝扶初），樂山有國立中央技專，自實右國立自貢工專等，學生人數的一萬二千人·中等敎育：全川目前計中學七一一所，內國立中學八所，公私立普通中學五四六所，師範八五所，職業學校七二所，學生人數共二三三，二六九人·社會敎育：全川民衆敎育館，計省立一所，縣市立一五六所，圖書館計省立一所，縣市立七九所，私立二六所。國民敎育：全川現有完全小學二，七三三所，國民學校二三，五二〇所，入學兒童三，八二四，八四三人，佔全川學齡兒童百分之八十以上。就以上整個槪况觀察，現階段四川敎育已顯然在發揚與推進中。</p>
<p>渡過困難　謀求改善</p>
<p>其决談到四川敎育工作施政情形，省府及敎育當局對此旣有成績，雖認爲得之不易，但亦認爲目前四川教育建設，尙未臻於理想，劉氏以敎育主管當局，深深感喟欲完全達成四川理想敎育，前途尙有步步荆棘與重重難關，據談到當前四川敎育推進最大困難，業結問題第一是經費不足第二是風氣不良。關於徑費問題，目前四川財政整個困難，本年度全省預算收支不敷一百十九億，而三十六年全川預算總收入僅九十七億，支出將達三百四十七億，相查二百五十億，在如此支舢的財政環境中，敎育經費，車水杯薪，欲談擴展，憂憂其難。關於風　題，四川過去敎育，　質良　不　，戰時，高等教育巳力事整頓，中等以下敎育，在抗　中四川特殊社會　境之下，社會不良風氣進人學校，敎師生活淸苦管敎之方，因而部份學生，外爲社會所轉移，內受　境之　染，行爲不免放蕩，小者蕩檢　閑，大者觸犯刑網，目前頗感積重難返，如本週成都連發生血案數件，中學生即佔其二，一爲私立成城中學因新舊校長之爭學生刺殺學生，一爲華西中學一學生槍擊同學，社會一般人士均認爲目前四川中學學風乖戾已達極點，這一點，劉氏認爲是常前四川敎育的最大隱憂。所以現在川省敎育常局主要工作，即爲針對此二困難問題，力謀解除與改善。　如何解除困難與改善弊點，劉氏談到目前敎育當局的二大積極工作，第一是設法充實經費第二是澈底改善風氣：</p>
<p>關於前者，爲配合四川敎育建設計劃，如擴展高等敎育，充實中等敎育，普及社會與國民敎育，高等敎育部份，請中央儘量補助，其餘部份，在省財政能力範圍以內，請省府儘量增加經費，此外並提倡學校造產，力求開源節流。</p>
<p>關於後者，劉氏於本年三月就職伊始，即揭　敎育工作五大方針：（一）民主化，（二）紀律化，（三）藥潔化，（四）科學化，（五）勞動生產化，即（一）辦學力採民主作風，對內對外一切公開，養成師生上下互信互愛之精神。（二）敎師自守師道，學生嚴守紀律，養成互重自愛之習慣。（三）辦理敎育工作者，持身絕對廉潔，財政絕對公開，俾以身作則，爲社會表率。（四）敎育適應需要以　　科學人才，提倡學生注意與社會重視科學，而治學興管理亦倡用科學方法。（五）提倡學生參加勞動，從事生產，俾能由自力而自立·五點之目的在養成全川學生均有自學自力自治自愛之能力。數月以來，敎廳即以此五點爲敎育方針，推行於全川各大中學，備著成效。劉氏以爲若能澈底實行五點要義，則學校學風，自然改善，敎育風氣，自然轉移。並且堅決表示，第一點困難的解除，權在中央省府，第二點弊點的改善，敎廳責無旁貸，前者當必力爭，後者要下決心，在短期內務必貫　完成。</p>
<p>把握方針　培育人才</p>
<p>最後談到四川今後敎育發展之方針與計劃，劉氏　爲渠本人意見，國大會議以後，國家制憲完成，建國工作開始，建國方針應在三民主義最高原則之下，實行三大政策：（一）政治民主化，（二）經濟社會化，（三）文化敎育科學化，國府還都，中央明定四川爲建設實騐區，蔣主席於吿別全川父老時，一再申言後四川建設之經費與人才，均將爲全國第一，四川敎育今後中心方針，自應仰體主席旨意，配合切實需要，以培植新四川之建設人才爲目的。今後敎育方針主要應爲兩點：（一）充實擴展高等敎育：目的在養成四川建設高級人才，省府已擬定計劃，準備增設川西，川中，川北，川東，川南五省立大學，並配合四川建設中主要工業與特殊生產人才之需要，在十六個行政區各增設專科學校。（二）普及中等，社會，國民敎育：目的在儲備四川建設幹部人才，四川目前統計大的人口爲四七·五四七·一二〇人，失學成人的六·七四〇·二一七人，人學的二·七九三·一八四人，失學之文盲的六百餘萬，對於國家建設阻　實大，今後四川新敎育應以普及中等以下敎育，救濟失學文盲，大量儲備建設基本幹部爲中心，二大方針主要目的則在完成四川敎育科學化，這是建設新四川之新敎育的特色。</p>

<p>— 查量鑑</p>
<p>四川抗戰爲領導全國，爭取勝利之首省，建國又爲全國模範區，四川敎育經過卅餘年的　路藍樓慘淡經營，由啓蒙繁榮而達現在的發揚時期，記者在與道位老參政員四川老敎育家作一席娓娓淸談之後，從他的堅定信心中，相信他必能排除一切困難，發場現有成績，以建設四川敎育達成建設新四川的偉大使命。</p>
<p>姻毒禍害至慘慘烈，昔林文忠公曾慨乎言之，盡人皆知，不待煩言。國家爲欲及早根絕此種荼毒，故不惜嚴刑重典，從事斷禁，其意要在弼以止弼，刑期無刑，欲早進我全民族於富强康樂之境，彰彰明甚</p>
<p>當今法嚴令肅，而上海一隅作奸犯科者，仍屬恒見，蓋因陷敵甚久，迫於敵偽之誘脅縱容，曼延荼毒，而無知姻民，沉湎不悟，罔議國家以姻毒懸爲厲禁之旨歸，陰私吸食，又相與因循，規避勒戒，尤爲未及完全斷禁之主因。今勝利已逾一年有四月，廓淸盪滌，實不容緩，自應從速嚴厲斷禁，以副國家及早澄淸之望</p>
<p>自本年四月迄今，上海地方法院，受理烟毒案件達一千五百餘起。除確無癮毒者外，皆已分別科以罪刑，無稍寬起，可謂爲嚴峻有力之昭示，尙冀選民引爲警覺，早自跋。</p>
<p>復按收復地區肅淸姻毒辦法第十三條規定，自施戒期限屆滿後，凡經檢舉調騐，尙未戒除癮毒者，一律依法以復吸論罪。又禁姻禁毒冶罪條例第八條規定凡施打嗎啡，或吸用毒品鴉片者，經勒令禁戒斷　後，復行施打或吸用者，處死刑或無期徒刑。至凡製造栽種販運及供人吸食毒品者，尤爲法所不貸，亦惟有死刑與無期徒刑。死者不可復生，刑者不可復　，人孰無知，何至以執迷　毒之故，自甘喪身亡家？信非自愚，必不出此。至於挾毒品以牟利者流，其心已可誅，固不可恕。吾人須知國家對斷禁姻毒，已具絕大決心，正　求從速厲行，舉凡前此已有癮毒者，望深自怵惕斷禁，痛改前非，其一無沾染者，允望母輕妄嘗試，更不得竊以毒品牟利，干犯法禁而受嚴峻處分。</p>
<p>今上海市清烟毒委員會已定於明年一月一日起，厲行吸毒總檢舉，幷光之以宣傳勸導，此其意端在肅淸斷禁，盪滌穢氛，過此已往，當不復再有寬假之望。歲聿云暮，時不我予，望懔明刑，及時憬悟，庶獲共進於富强康樂，躋彼春台，則厚幸矣！</p>

<h3 id="c164">上海工商危機之透視 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 許其京</p>
<p>中國經濟之重心，隨着勝利而由重慶凱旋上海·上海·原是中國最盛最早的一個國際商塲。上海，也是中國最廣大最現代化的一個工商經濟區域。</p>
<p>中於抗戰的勝利不平等條約的廢除，租界的收回，領事裁判權的撤銷，關稅的自主，應該使此嶄新的大上海，自然地成爲我們中國勝利後建設一個工業化的現代國家的神經中樞，我們的確曾蘊蓄着無限的熱情，懷望着這一個美麗的　景！</p>
<p>勝利以還，倐逾周年，國府還都，亦早吿竣，而我們巡視上海，却把我們的理想幻滅了，幾乎秖剩下一個奇異的夢！</p>
<p>當前的上海工商情况，一句話說盡，不是復興景象，而是危機重用。其危機，在高利貸，高工資，高成本，高賦稅。在這重重高壓下，在資金，原料，產銷，運輸及外貨傾銷的種種困難中，上海的工商界現已處於　火積薪中境。一旦金融風潮要來，則上海工商恐將不能免於空前的恐慌。</p>
<p>我們不應將上海工商市塲僅僅看做中國經濟的一面，應該認淸上海工商乃全中國經濟的　樞紐。故上海工商如果繼續衰敗，必然逐漸使中國經濟有瀕於總崩潰的一天！</p>
<p>「諱疾忌醫」，祇有加重病　；防止衰敗，亦僅限於消極治療。我們試一檢討勝利以來的財政經濟的措施，實在感觸萬端。</p>
<p>高壓在上海工商上面的是高利貸，高工資，高成本，高稅率；　呈在上海工商前面的是資金缺乏，原料困難，外貨傾銷，巿塲狹隘。</p>
<p>以上工商的種種困難，在一個大戰後的的國家，產業袞敗，原是難免的事實，而其主要因素，乃在戰時及戰後財政的艱難，影響到戰後貨幣金融整理問題。例如：第一次大戰後的英，德，日，俄諸國，皆有產業衰敗的經過。但問題在於政府是否具有振興產業的對策．我們試看：此次大戰後的美國，經濟復員可謂迅速，產業振興，亦非常快捷。我們再看：此次大戰後的英國，亦能於創巨痛深中，迅速完成經濟復員，英國商務訪華團此次欣然東來，更足徵英國產業振興之突飛猛晋，與英國遠東貿易發展之念起直追。我們更看：戰勝後的蘇聯，第四次五年計劃業已完成一年。而戰敗後的日本，紡織工業亦已恢復增產，行且推銷國外，尤其値得我們警惕。可見根本問題在於實施良好的經濟政策。</p>
<p>我們認爲：中國當前經濟危機，亦即上海工商衰敗之最大　結，在於迹近惡性的通貨膨脹與幣値的不斷下跌。而挽救當前經濟危機及工商衰敗的對策，其最重要的措施，則當在於幣値的積極穩定。</p>
<p>現代經濟機構，貨幣實爲其中心。產業之案興與衰敗，必以貨幣爲動力。尤以近廿年來，世界經濟進入信用經濟時代，各國自一九三一年以後先後實施通貨政策，而利用通貨膨脹與通貨緊縮爲產業經濟的調節。故挽救工商經濟危機，亦應注重通貨政策之運用·美國前總統羅斯福之一九三一年之「新政」，其產業復興法案的實行成功，貴在於運用通貨膨脹政策以挽救當時物價的在跌。</p>
<p>中國經此八年長期大戰，戰時物資的耗損，自然巨大，而戰時財政的艱困，勢屬必然，通貨膨脹，常爲萬不得已。</p>
<p>但在勝利以還，常軸的經濟財政金融政策的措施，祇在挽救戰後產　衰敗與經濟危機的治標方面，作各種應付，而無通盤澈底解決整個問題的迅速策劃與雷　風行的勇氣。因之，工商危機與國民生計，不但沒有根本澈底療救與改善，反而病入　肓，有日趨沉重之勢·時至今日，我們認爲，當軸的財政金融經濟揹施，必須應有新的策動。</p>
<p>日前電訊傳來：政府爲解決常前財政經濟困難起見，特　具當前財政經濟措施改進方案，交行政院辦理，刻政院正發交有關部會商討具體辦法，循序進行中。並悉該方案共分三大項，其梗槪爲：第一項爲協助生產貸款；第二項爲利用外責；第三項爲民生日用必需品價格及工資之管制。至其詳細實施，固</p>
<p>有待常軸的執行，我們靜觀其成，不欲在此多加申論。惟關於生產貸款問題，早已實行，其中按術問題及其困難情形，今日工高界深有所感。而關於利用外資問題，原非簡單，亦覺緩不濟急。至關於民生日用必需品價格及工資管制問題，更屬舊調重彈，在中國而　制，則苦苦九年經騐，實足爲今後物價管制政策的痛鑑！</p>
<p>然而，以上三項方案之經濟措置，根本說來，還祗是物價與通貨問題而已。</p>
<p>今僅就當前上海工商危機構成之主要因素的高利貸，先加檢討：</p>
<p>高利貸之產生，乃爲惡性的通貨膨脹所促成。今日法幣發行確數究竟多少，諱莫如深，秘而不宣。財政當局自廿六平下半年以來，迄未再有正式檢查報吿發表。此在戰時原可諒解，在戰後則深爲抱憾。</p>
<p>雖然最近根據財政當局的宣稱：本年六七兩月份法幣未增發，而近幾月來所增發法幣數量，亦極徵少。果能如此，我們要爲工商振興慶，更爲民生改善喜。此原爲制止通貨膨脹已收實效，逐漸好轉。惜當軸未能有正確明白數字公開發表，以取信於人民。</p>
<p>然而，物價在八月十九日以前幾個月中尙呈穩定。但自八月十九日中央銀行第二次改訂外匯匯率三二五〇後，物價受其刺激而上升，後由於美鈔。黄金·港幣之　風作浪，更使物價動盪不安。月來更由於國營公用事業的郵。電·火車·自來水·電燈的加價，一般物價又蒙其影響，都在醞釀漲價聲中。物價指數如再上升，則軍公敎人員待遇急需調整，尤以龐大軍費爲甚，財政支出又或繼續　物價漲而追加。今後的法幣，如何能保證不增加行發？設若法幣發行增加，豈非又將刺激物價上漲？回溯民國廿八年以來的物價與法幣循環賽跑，疲勞追逐，迄今不休，可爲殷鑒！</p>
<p>物價漲，幣値跌。以十月份上海物價指數論：食物爲五六四，九一三·六二，住屋爲三六三，七三三·〇九；衣着爲一，〇一二，八〇七·八六；雜品爲四〇四，五八〇·〇六·總指數：爲五二一，八五五·六七·（來源：根據市政府發表統計）而幣値已跌至一分跌至·〇〇二·總之，物價如再漲，幣値將終無穩定之一日。</p>
<p>幣値不穩定，法幣購買力削弱，影響所及：（一）國民所得的遞减；（二）國民經濟心理的不健全；（三）國民儲蓄的呆滯；（四）國民負擔的加重（通貨膨脹，乃爲平民對國家的無形負擔）。因之，一面游資集中，投機渤利，擾亂金融市塲，促成當者愈富·另一面國民所得受通貨貶値而遞减，平民生計日益艱困，而貧者愈貧。凡持有法幣者，因其幣値難以確保，相率以爭購黄金，美鈔，港幣，遂致巿面頭寸奇缺，而工商所需流動資金，隨着工資本於生活指數而增高，及原料價格上漲，其數字動輒萬萬，而法幣數量巨大，因之，利率高昂，勢屬必然。</p>
<p>上海利率，根據最近上海錢業公吿爲一角六分半利息，較各地爲高。如此高利貨，已成上海工商業的致命傷！</p>
<p>上海巿工商業，自入秋以來，受高利貸之壓迫，商店則倒閉淸理，工廠則停工减工，大部陷於半停頓狀態。八·九·十三個月內，上海市正式宣吿淸理，或破產之工廠·公司·商行·凡八十家。因之，今日上海高利貸，究將運用何種政策以求抑平，實是一個切要問題。近聞財政當局鑒於各地高利貸之風甚熾，對整個經濟影響甚大，爰電中央銀行實施取締。中央銀行稽核處，現採取由各地銀錢業議定利率，再呈中央銀行核准辦法。最近上海錢業公會之一角六分半利息，似嫌太高，稽核處已函令銀錢二業同業公會，今後須按照市面情形逐漸將利率抑低。並聞中央銀行運用金融力量對市塲利率，以彈性方法逐漸壓低，至十二分以下，爲初步標準。關於地下錢莊，中央銀行亦已擬訂取締辦法，呈財部核准後施行，或可收相當效果。惟金融當軸亦深感：「高利貸造成之原因，甚爲複雜，快非硬性平抑所能奏效。」</p>
<p>今日上海高利貸究竟如何方可消滅？我們認爲：</p>
<p>其一，擴大生產貸款當前上海工商業因爲原料貴，工資高，成本加重，所需流動資金亦鉅。高利貸款，原屬不堪高壓，被逼運用，不啻「自殺政策」·而所仰望於政府者，所予工商貸款，其數甚微，加以手續，抵押條件太苛，申請不易，尤感緩不濟急之苦。今政府旣爲解決當前財政經濟困難起見，擬具當前財政經濟措施改進方案，其協助生產貸款項內，三十六年度貸款總額預定爲五百億，院令商擬具體辦法·關於貨物運銷方面，四聯原有「放寬貸款辦法」，「轉抵押」等辦法。我們認爲：（一）五百億的生產貸款，數額仍屬不足。以上海工商業之需要資金之大，小小商店舉債動輒千萬，小型工廠亦需億數，又豈此區區五百億所能濟事？甚望當局能切實配合生產計劃，予以實際之挽救。（二）放寬貸款，正爲上海工商所企望，而貨物運銷之便利，亦爲上海工商業所晨夕禱祝的，今後貸款手續如何簡化，貸款抵押條件如何减輕，勢必以便利工商爲原則，切切不可成爲具文。（三）銀團貸款應行擴大，實爲當務之急，自應不必限於鹽茶兩種。一切施政，貴在速決速行，劍及　及，始能解決問題，此則有待於當局之努力了。</p>
<p>其二，勵行利率政策。　今日之高利貸，所以釀成之原因，我們認爲中央銀行沒有做到「銀行之銀行」的職能，四聯總處，亦未盡其主力消滅當前工商危機之職　　，實是重大的因素。今後中央銀行如何强化職能，固學常局切實推進，而國家銀行專業化，允須加强。利率的升高與抑低，原受中央銀行之利率政策所左右。而中央銀行亦必以工商振興與衰敗，以策劃其利率之高低·今日上海高利貸，中央銀行所施取締辦法，所謂銀行存款利率，不得超媧放款利率之高限額，實在是一句笑話，天下有那一家銀行錢莊願意高利吸收存款而低利放出貸款的？這稱利率管理辦法，只是騙騙孩童而已！當然問題　結還在通貨膨脹·通貨膨脹之不正，一切都是空談！</p>
<p>其三，積極整理幣制以目前經濟實况論，國營公用事業領導漲價，百物亦躍躍欲升，而物價再漲，則政府經費必須增加，緊縮通貨勢不可能。處此工商衰敗之下·國家財政，欲求增，稅，以裕政府收人，不啻殺鷄取卵，竭澤而漁。加以中美商約業已締結，互惠貿易限制了關稅的收入。以言募債，更屬困難，舊債未淸，而幣値不斷下跌，新債何能發行？若賴國營工礦電事業的營利收入，就過去八九年的經騐來看，等於緣太求魚。所餘者，增發通貨與出價敵偽產業二途而已。財政若不加以積極整理，長此拖延下去，欲求收支平衡，當待何日？我們認爲：積極整理幣制，實爲改革財政之初步。我們認爲：只有積極整理幣制，遏止通貨膨脹，穩定幣値，然後國家財政始有辦法。</p>
<p>總之，通貨整理，幣値安定，而後國民所得，隨着產業振興而增加，國民儲蓄亦隨財富壘積而劇增，社會金融方可步入常軌。蓋貨幣購買力確保，物價亦必日趨安定。今日工商界所遭遇之高利貸，高工資，高成本，資金缺乏諸困難，庶幾可以迎刃而解；今日之平民經濟生活，亦得以從此改善。</p>

<h3 id="c166">中國工業應標準化 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 告白</p>
<p>中國幾十年來工業的落伍是爲的什麼？這是一個普天的中國人應該相問的。筆者在這種可以大膽的說，第一就是不標準化，第二就是無組織，現在就筆者所知寫在下面。</p>
<p>我們知道工業上的浪費有一個最爲重要的原因，就是所製出品底種類過於繁雜。出品繁雜的原因，由於一般購買者的是他們常需要有一種適合於個人特性的出品。如許多顧客喜歡用特別形式的信紙，特別設計的小刀適合個人特別需要的家具，和與鄰家不同的汽車都是。此外身上穿的服裝那將時常更有許多新奇的樣式，不能不想應付現在製造者爲想應付這些日新月異的變異情形起見，已經發起一種組織完密的運動，這種遝動不但能够在可能的範圍內，壓阻出品變異趨勢底繼長增高，而且還可以掃除現在工業界中由於這種趨勢的種種浪費。這種運動底基礎，就是簡單化（Simplication）和標準化（tandardization）。</p>
<p>簡單化標準化</p>
<p>——標準化作用經濟原理，及其優點和劣點，我們暫且不談。其界說可以解釋做將任何出品化入一定形式，一定大小及一定性質的一種作用。例如在好幾年以前，一般工程師都不的而同的承認六角形或四方形是鐵栓頭部及母螺旋底最適用的形式。其决他們又一致主張所有某種尺寸以上的鐵栓應有某某一定的直徑。以後他們對於每種大小的鐵栓，及每種容積的鐵栓頭部及母螺旋，應可剪若干細錢，又頗爲一致。所不曾規定的就是鐵栓底長度，不過小的短的也有一定的規定。後來美國自動車工程師公會（Society　of　Automobile）Engimeers）又很嚴密地規定製造汽車鐵栓的鋼鐵底所有化時的要素，因之所有鐵栓底形式，大小和品質都已規定完全了。可是商業上的標準化在大戰以前，還是大部分限於大規模的工程組織或科學組織。</p>
<p>美國加入大戰以後，軍事工業局底保富股（ConservationDiuioion　of　The　Warhmaustries　Bard）開始一種很活動的運動，去减少所有製造品底繁夥的形式，以期解放大部分的勞動，資本，原料及工具，藉供軍事上的用途。該部從事這種工作底成績，很爲可觀，本文不及細敍，但是讀者很値得去硏究一番的，現在這種工作是由該國商部底工作化簡組（Dluision　of　Simplified　Practice）繼續主持，其成績也大有進步。大概他們從事這種運動的方法，是先仔細硏究這種問題，然後召集各製造家，賣者及買者底代表從長討論，以期得着他們底同意，去减少若干形式，結果他們竟將舖地的花磚，於六十六形式之中减少了五十五種。</p>
<p>簡單化一語就是用來指明這種减少製品形式的運動，許多近代的作者以爲這個術語應與標準化完全分立。其實這種說法是沒有理由的。例如據以上所述的鐵栓標準化的歷史常除六角形及方形的以外所有其他形式的頭部及母螺旋都廢棄不用的時候，那些遺留下來的形式當然就是標準的形式了，×如除現在通用的幾種大小的鐵栓以外，所有其他鐵栓都廢棄不用，那些遺韶下來的鐵栓常然也就是標準鐵栓了。</p>
<p>此外我們也不能以眞實的標準化必須眼據科學原理的一種理由，來說標準化和簡單化有不同的地方。誠然多餘的形式常常可以不必用科學的方法去刪除，但我們如因這樣就要一槪而論那就常常是靠不住的。</p>
<p>標準化底組織</p>
<p>近代從事標準化工作的機關，可以很便利的分做四種；就是國際的，國家的，某種工業的及某個工廠的標準化組織。關於國際機關的工作，所謂標進當然都是屬於基本的性質，而有普遍的用途的。如電阻單位，電力單位，分，秒，米達之類都是。此外鐵路上所用的標準軌幅也是屬於國際的性質。</p>
<p>美國關於發展及審定基本的科學標準的工作，大部分都是依賴美國標準局（United　States　Bureauof　Standards）如和克長度標準計（Hoke　Standard　Gages　of　Langth）精確至一英寸底一百萬分之一就是由該局所規定的．至關於工業上及工程上所用的標準，則大概是由許多工程的組織及專門技術的組織制定出來，如美國機械，工程學會所出的汽鍋規律（Boiler　Code）就成爲該國一切汽鍋製造標準，甚至各邦還有規定成律的。此外爲避免工作底重複及得到大規模的合作起見，該國有三十三個最重要的專門技術組織並曾以派遣代表的方法，合組一個美國工程標準委員會。各種實際審定標準的工作，仍舊由應行隸屬的各門機關主持，而討諭及比較的工作則由全體委員會解決。這個無疑是一個目下最有勢力的從事標準工作的組織，將來對於國際的標準工作，也許是大有影響的。</p>
<p>形式大小標準</p>
<p>就現在情形而論要使製造品形式及大小，趨於簡單化的遝動遍及於一切工業，大槪總不是在很短的時間內所辦到的；而揀選若干最佳的形式及最便利的大小底問題，要使大部分製造家都能解決，也大非易易。這種情形底理由之一是因爲這些東西底標準化，常常含有若干經驗的色彩，而非數學的方法所能解決的。例如一個製造家如要製造一定大小及一定能量的汽機或一定長度一定闊度的靴鞋，他就必須根據平均律（Law　of　Auerage）演繹出來一種結論，以期所出的形式和大小，可以適應最大底需要。</p>
<p>可是這是很顯明的，這樣定出來的標準，總不脫於隨意決定的色彩，其實內中是儘有揀選的餘地的。例如長度底標準尺，爲什麼這樣長，實是沒有什麽特別的優點，如初定的時候，定得長些短些，其功用還是一樣。此外如領，外衣，鞋，及其他許多製造品底形式及尺寸也都是隨意規定的。這種標準只能在某種沒有一定的需要限度內，粗粗地解決一些應付需要的問題；其實這種標準所代表的範圍，同時還是爲較大及較下的標準所掩蓋的。所以交易或互相交換底標準，其規定的手續，大概都是近於隨意的性質，我們如要爲便於製造起見，很精確地定出一二形式及大小底標準，實在是非對於這部分的工業有極淸晰的了解不可。</p>
<p>優美底標準——我們須要注意，一種物品底形式或大小巳經標準化了，可以同時有幾個優美底標準。而且並不一定於所有種類之中必須尋出一種最高的優美標準。例如某種模型某種大小的鞋子，可以同時兼製品質不同的幾種，以應各級人民底需要。再講貴重一些的出品，如照相機之類，假使只有最上等的一種製造出來，那麼能够享受這種東西的人勢必至於寥寥無幾。所以這是很需要的，假便有一種品質最高的物品製造出來，同時也再可以製一種形式相同大小相同的出品，雖然其優美底標準是略低一些。可是無論優美底標準是高是低，而一經規定所有出品就必須和這些標準絕對相符，這也是很重要的。</p>
<p>工程的標準</p>
<p>工程部必須決定大部分出品底標準形式及大小，並須規定標準機械所有部分底式樣及尺寸。此外假使出品底交換可能性是需要的，工程部又須決定所有部分底大小和形式，使交換底目的可以進行無阻。至於該部自己底工作，即當然也要標準化的。所以一切材料底配取單須必有標準的尺寸，所有技術上的指導文件，必須有標準的形式；材料刻字及開單的樑準方法必須施行，所有圖樣及機件底標準符號必須採用。這些標準的方法，不但使辦事上有條理，而且可以發生最高的効率。</p>
<p>標準的材料——標準的分類方法，對於進貨的需要，是很重要。但材料標準化底利益和經濟卻是很少人知道。有許多工廠關於所用材料底品質問題，完全由存貨主任或工頭決定。道種辦法，在很小的工廠或專做修理工作的工廠裘，或且是很爲够用。但無論如何一種工作總要各部分都能用到相當的材料，然後纔能得到較佳的出品和較底的成本。這當然不是說無論什麽部分都要用最上等的材料，不過是說假使某種品質的材料，已經選定爲某種用途之後，那麼以後便要時常留心，所用的材料並無錯誤。</p>
<p>减少各種材料底形式及大小底差異，常常可以節省巨量的金錢，所以材料標準化之後，特別材料堆積棧中任其貶値及擱置大量資本底危險，都可以减少許多。這種利益對於供給品底標準化也是一樣。總之這些東西總要等到用途目的，仔細考究之後　可以購進。</p>
<p>標準的數量</p>
<p>審愼規定所用材料底數量，也可以發生巨大的經濟。在修理工作之下，使用材料底經濟常常成爲一種個人的謹愼問題，但當同樣的工作須繼續重做下去的時候，材料底數量，就須特別注意，材料底淸單也須有一定的標準，使其同時可以作爲進貨底根據及向棧房配取材料底根據。又材料淸單無論是由工程部製出或生產事務員製出，都應存人檔案，以備將來的參考。</p>
<p>供給品數量底標準化，也是一種經濟的手段，在大工廠裏那些供給品，如洗滌機械的廢料，油及掃帚等等，都可以用預算底制度配發，各人於每一定期間，得收到一次職務上所必需的數量。此外，這也是很容易的去標準化每若干匹馬力所需煤的數量，或各種工業程序中所用的煤汽化學品，或其他材料底數量。假使這些標準數量，有時須超過一些，那麼這些額外的增加，就非有相當的理由來解釋不可。</p>

<p>羊毛織物於中性熱甲醛液內經長時期處理，能吸收甲醛而减少其收縮，惟經數次洗滌後，仍收縮極烈！</p>
<p>新法係將毛織法處於甲醛及酸液內，而延續加熱以促其作用完全；再洗而乾之，由此法處理毛織物雖經久洗，亦不失其防縮特性，且可增加强防縐力，染着力及抗碱力，設於處理液中亦可同時加入染料而染色，或毛織物先印以防染物，而後處理於甲醛酸及染料液內，則又可得花紋。</p>

<p>— 鐘德琪譯</p>
<p>我國牲畜，多爲役畜，爲數極少，此爲我國農業經濟特質之一。影響於農家收入者極大。本文即爲針對此問題之建議，同時亦爲中國農業提出一經濟的輪作制（Rolation）。本文作者魏凱思（D．Week），爲美著名農業專家。曾於民國廿年來華講學。對中國農業問題極爲關心。譯者附誌。</p>
<p>中國土地利用是非常集的，也是非常粗放。在中國巾部有些牧草和灌木丘陵地帶，有時他們是可不必像現在專爲生產燃料而工作的，棉田在中國適於其生長的地區中已經擴大。但棉花是損土作物（Soil-deplecing　Crop）．然而棉花的種子已經成爲了牲畜飼料的主要來源。</p>
<p>在巴西中部，棉花和瘤牛（Zebu）或婆羅門牛在農業上大有用處。</p>
<p>從農畜來講，巴西牛的生產問題和中國中部相似。病和寄生虫使那些企圖從阿根廷大平原一直到巴西中南部的亞熱地帶推廣有利的生產短角牛（Shorthorns），海福達牛（Herefolds），安格士牛（Aherdeen）。譯者按：以上三種均爲肉用種。前二者均產於英國，短角牛以其角短得名，海福達牛則以其產地名之。安格士牛原產於蘇格蘭東北部之Angus　Aberdeen-shireAngus故名）的人，在經濟上遭受不幸，瘤牛是可抵抗瘤，寄生虫。甚至昆虫的。牠發源在印度，而繁衍在炎熱的氣候中。</p>
<p>開始，巴西的畜牧者試用「海福達」和其他認可的牛種雜交，這已經在美國Taxes處試騐成功。但在巴西，瘤牛的特性即有一種優越的趨勢，牠和當地牲畜的雜交種，變得和瘤牛的駝峯的特性極相似。現在的趨勢是繁殖瘤牛的特性，繁衍好牛的形狀和淺的色澤，害虫襲擊黑牛，但淺色的牛却比較容易避免。</p>
<p>開始歧視瘤牛的色裝商人，現在也覺得牠是巴西牛肉工業的救星。後半部份在上等牛肉出口市塲中，已允許付以同等的價格，前半部和駝峯則裝在罐頭中或乾製</p>
<p>遠在巴西中部。土地的發達和繁榮在進展中，農場編製計劃是棉花Coloniao，和牛。Coloniao是基尼草（Guinea　geiass）-（Panicum　Maximum）的巴西字。（譯者按：　尼草學名爲（PanicumMaximum）爲禾本科稷屬之一種，產於熱帶高達4-10呎之多年年生草木，供飼料用者）。牛，就是指瘤牛和當地及其他種雜交者。基尼草在栽種棉花四年後牧放，牠是過去像開拓作物一樣種在棉椿中的，這些作物互相補充供給牛的營養飼料。這些栽培牧草保護土壤冲刷，和保留在疲憊栽培棉花以後的地力，在無霜年裏，牧草全畝都是長得和牛一樣高。</p>
<p>用發展交通，用石油或電力來代替燃料，介紹經濟的發熟原素來代替草和樹枝燃燒舊有火爐，中國經過同樣一個作物輪作不可能得到利益嗎？在有些地方，這些計劃是不是不可能在今天完全證實成功？這個問題是不是値得畜牧農藝，和農塲管理專家所放在他們的硏究中去？</p>

<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>這怎麽好算大年初一呢？天重重地壓着，如果沒有那幾個山頭支撑的話，準會直坍在地上。雪填滿了坑谷，白雪和灰點的天空正成了一個對比，烏鴉成羣地亂飛亂呌，像大禍快臨頭了，也像要打破這灰色的寂寥，山上的竹子大都倒在地下，至少也成了環形。荆棘還是露出猙獰的臉，刺破了白雪，山谷中糊裏糊塗像佈滿了妖霧。人們的心理，也是沉重得鉛似的。常然，大年初一有這麽壞的天氣，誰也會不快，而新四軍離這裏只十里路的消息，更給人不安。拜年，賭錢，都被拋向九霄雲去了，敵人，到這種窮地方來頂多是流竄，山上躲一躱就了事。新四軍那不成哩，淸算，捐戲，村上人雖沒有富戶，飽飯還是有得吃的。攤派重，總不至於要財產的一半的。迎那毫無牽掛爲人做短工的囡頭也不安了，因爲他怕當兵，做短工飯酒黄姻還有得吃，新四軍來了要沒有人敢雇短工了，道怎成？</p>
<p>小李，在老中央的縣政府做事。其實，不是抗戰，他一定是一個漂亮的大學生。高中畢了業，嚥不下被敵人奴役的氣，寗可冒險在敵偽夾縫裏鑽，工作。待人怪好的，誰不說小李是淸官呢？——實在話，他不過是縣政府的會計佐理員而已。鄕長也說：「縣政府的人我只佩服小李先生一個。</p>
<p>小李先生，你走開點，新四軍見了老中央要殺的！」楊老保長拎了旱姻管和姻袋，對小李這樣講。是的，他應該走開些，可是許多賬册單據沒拿走，庶務老爺早押了縣長行李走了，賬册損失了對縣長反正有益無損。另外科室拉伕子，會計室郭主任在省政府，担子就落在他身上。保長說村上所有的伕子都已經拉走，這怎麽辦？</p>
<p>於是只好把公文呌兩個小孩搬上山中的茅屋裏藏了起來。小李本來穿便衣，現在把一切證件和鋼筆都塞在雪下，放在屋子裏是沒有人有偌大胆子担干係，查出了可準得「抄家」。</p>
<p>「撲——」木壳槍響了一下，近得很。</p>
<p>「噠噠噠……」輕機槍，「拍，拍—吱—」子彈從屋子邊上飛過，老保長呌小李快走。小李只得向屋後的山徑上一走。走過了三四所屋子，馬上被兩個匐伏着疾走的穿灰色制服的發現了。</p>
<p>「站住——」他們喊了，槍口對着他，好怕人，一個打了一槍十彈飛過小李的身邊，短急地銳呌一聲。</p>
<p>「過來，把手舉起，打田裏過來，快些，媽的，快！」小李乖乖地走入了田裏，雪水濺上大腿，浸透　管，　泥沒了脚踝。</p>
<p>一陣搜索，袋裏還有二千元法幣，一只剛從指上取下來的訂婚戒請被藏人了他們的袋裏，一個兵拉拉他身上的絨線衫。</p>
<p>「你不是好東西，，三靑團！老中央到那兒去了？老實講！」</p>
<p>一我不知道，我是做生意的。」小李只得這樣講。</p>
<p>「媽的，這還造謊！」「拍！」一聲淸脆的巴掌聲。</p>
<p>「　　多講，帶營部去！」另一</p>
<p>見了營長，幾個兵在「搜索」，斷續地打槍，指導員在阻止，却沒生效力，大槪指導員衣服穿太少了，每一聲槍響他就會打一個寒噤，士兵是長長的棉制服，粗粗的綁腿，有耳披的帽子，沒有帽徽，精　的子彈帶，長長短短的步槍，中正式，七七式，漢造，套筒，三八式……幾予可以開一個展覽會。</p>
<p>「你看來也是有智識的，」營長總算承認他是商人了，因爲這是其他捉去的老百姓證明的，「爲什麽還呆在老中央那裏？他們已經是頑固老傢伙了，有什麼留戀？哈，我們新四軍才是眞正的革命軍，老百姓誰不說我們好？我們到那兒，那兒的老百姓就解放了，你也是靑年，你可以跟了我們革命，有吃有穿，怕什麽？別　，住道兒是不出山的。」</p>
<p>小李低了頭，過分的驚恐，和敵偽的殘暴，逃出魔窟的辛苦，父母的期望，自己的前途，未婚妻的吿誠……這些稱形和念頭，潮水似地在他腦子裏湧動。</p>
<p>「不要打了，一顆子彈要打死一個敵人哪！」指導員兩手交叉了，高聲地喊着，執着槍的手也藏入了懷裏，槍聲還是不停，「拍——」指導員打一個噤，「拍——」又是一個噤。</p>
<p>被帶到D村，遇到了××報的趙編輯，他們交換了無言的眼光，也不敢招呼。另外有一個瀉肚子的老中央落伍兵，不是瀉，就是摔着肚子呻吟。士兵把拿來的肉·魚·年糕·鷄·　子等，燒了一大鍋，大家分了吃。俘虜們也分到一些，只是盛的傢伙是村店裏放辣醬的缽頭，辣的他們直淌眼淚。</p>
<p>小李病了，身上濕了受了寒，晚間沒睡好，三個人合一條帶霉味的破　胎，簡直就硬凍；房子中間生了火堆，房子却凉亭似的，走近了像烤麵包，走開了就寒顫，睡時當然不會近火堆；於是，喉嚨啞，鼻子塞住；又是恐懼，憂急，失望等情感絞着他的心，胃口倒了，頭重脚輕搖搖欲倒。坐起來或站起來就是眼前金星亂　。</p>
<p>部隊又得開拔，一陣子的亂，忙着找伕子運「戰利品」，士兵也要整理「洋財」。好容易在一個舖滿雪的操塲上整了隊，營長穿上了「新裝」，顯得挺神氣</p>
<p>小李迷迷糊糊地站着，說不出是什麽感覺。突然，營長呌他和那個瀉肚子的落伍兵出去。他更惘然地不知走到那兒去了。</p>
<p>營長向他們打量了一下，說：</p>
<p>「嗯，你們這種身體這樣糟，我用不着你們，暫時先回去，等好了再來，不過小心！沒有新四軍的許可哪決不可走出解放區一步，否則的話——哼，我們解放區的紀律是嚴格的！我就當你們反動派看，做生意的做生意，種田的種田，絕對不能反叛共產黨！知道沒有？」</p>
<p>小李惘然地點點頭。</p>
<p>「好，去吧！」營長揮揮手。</p>
<p>小李糢糊地走出了他們的隊伍，似夢似幻地爬上了回去的H嶺，回顧D村，被雪染成潔白世界的地面上，一些灰色的人們在移動。</p>
<p>「解放了，」他下意識地摸着空袋，拖着沉重的步子下嶺，山谷中只有竹上殘雪掉在地上發出空洞的細語。</p>
<h3 id="c171">爲貝多芬誕辰紀念寫 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>一七七〇年今天（十二月十六日），萊因河畔誕生了一位熱情的天才——音樂家貝多芬·</p>
<p>貝多芬的傳記史蹟，世所盡知，筆者不欲重新翻印他底生平與作品，僅以膚淺之見，來表示內心深厚的崇敬。</p>
<p>貝多芬令人欽敬，不單因爲作品的感召力，也因爲他把所有的智慧與精力，百分之百地交付給比他生命更高超的音樂藝術。他終身不娶，因勞心過度而中年失聰，失聰之後，在遭受音樂的致命傷之下，依然奉獻其僅餘的生命與天才，勤於創作，而在遺囑中仍然吶喊着未竟最後的音符。這種與命運鬥爭，爲藝術不惜孤注一擲的精神，在音樂史上，實罕前例。和別的音樂家恰恰相反，在貝氏史略中，很少「羅曼史」的故事，「月光曲」雖然是寫明獻給　人的「幻想曲風奏鳴樂」，但卻不見下文。他雖一度與某伯爵之妹私訂婚的，結果並未成婚。死後，有人在貝多芬的秘密抽屜中，獲情書一通，爲貝多芬之親筆，詞短意切，但無對方姓名，不知何所指。總之，只氏一生，精力心血，幾已全部消耗在鍵盤與音符上，極少爲兒女之情而分心。是的，這使他性情乖僻，舉動暴躁，（例如他喜歡玩水，他在演奏時，聽衆如談話，他不惜中止演奏。）然而，這種精神上非常態的表現，正說明：他底全部心靈已溶化在一個東西（音樂）上了他底主要作品只有九個交響樂，一個歌劇……，三十二個鋼琴奏鳴樂他不求量的多，而求質的精。他深知；「多產必少佳作」。</p>
<p>他底最大傑作是第九交響樂，因爲破例地加入了合唱部份，又稱「合唱交響樂」，是交響樂中之特出者。</p>
<p>我常覺得：貝多芬的宗敎色彩，使他底作品包容於深厚的博　中。試聽他底田園交響樂（第六），暗示着：高山流水潺潺，林間烏語嚶嚶，牧童吹着笛，農人和着　……種種大自然所給予人類的愛和快感，眞是無詞可以描述。</p>
<p>貝多芬享年雖亦五十七，但他底作品則遠較一般音樂家少，</p>
<p>想起了　子貝多芬，就好像聽見他底「田園樂」，靈魂自世俗的圈子裏奔向偉大的自然！</p>

<p>使萎謝的花草發出新芽，</p>
<p>使枯老的枝條生出嫩葉，</p>
<p>使蟄伏的蛹蟲蠕動着，</p>
<p>使野地的牛羊豎起耳朶，</p>
<p>使老年人底面額蕩起靑春的笑，</p>
<p>使靑年人底心葉諧上幸福的歌，</p>
<p>使遊風更頑皮而活潑，</p>
<p>使陽光更多情而溫暖，</p>
<p>使巳死的愛念復活，</p>
<p>便大地回春了。</p>
<p>這便是生活啊！</p>
<p>這便是人類的長存，</p>
<p>生物的生生不息啊！</p>
<p>但馭馬的孩子却不能歌唱啊！</p>
<p>他像病了，</p>
<p>像完全爲苦痛的生活所　痺了；</p>
<p>駕車的馬駒也不能歌唱啊，</p>
<p>牠像過度的飢餓，過度倦怠了</p>
<p>但馭馬的孩子，</p>
<p>還得向牠吆喝着，鞭打着</p>
<p>—這便是生活的鞭子啊！</p>
<p>他還能傾聽這歌聲嗎？</p>
<p>牠還能咀味這歌聲嗎？</p>
<p>雖然他是混在歌聲中</p>
<p>牠是載着歌聲，拖着歌聲的。</p>
<p>這世界還多缺陷啊！</p>
<p>這歡快的歌聲還藏着鳴咽啊！</p>
<p>這人類還需要更大的公平與和諧啊</p>

<h3 id="c174">究竟是誰欺騙了你？ <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 趙沅</p>
<p>已近午夜的時候了。院子裏是無邊的靜，偶而有一兩個小販跑進來沙聲沙氣的喊幾聲：「炒米糖，開水，鹽茶鷄蛋；……」。這些斷斷續續像似病人呻吟的呌聲，聽起來，眞令人討厭，它代替了白天院子裏孩子們嘈雜的喧囂，點綴了黑夜的沉寂，突破了這靜悄悄的四周。冷月西偏，更深人靜，給我帶來了莫名的惆悵。遠處的天主敎堂送來一陣淸幽凄楚的鐘聲。</p>
<p>一件回憶無形中泛上了我的心頭。</p>
<p>那是將近四年前的事了。在嘉陵江邊，由於興趣的關係，在一個文學討論會上我們獲得了初步的認識。短短的兩個月裏面，我們由陌生變成了莫逆，萍水相逢的友誼而漸漸已恨相逢見晚了。不同的年齡，兩個相距幾萬里的家鄕，我們締結成了肝胆相照的知己。一起玩，一起讀書，一起談天，他的智慧，見解，學識給予我莫大的啓示，使我敬愛他一直到現在。每當陽西下，薄暮將臨的時候，他站在小山　上，對天空裏流往東北的浮雲發出無限的感槪，常懷念起他底淪亡的故鄕——白山黑水。家庭的不睦造成他愛好孤癖喜靜的性情。他常常對敵寇的猖獗，國事的日非，發出憤怒憎惡的共鳴，他愛祖國，愛故鄉，才使後來他能踏上征途，遠征印緬而葬屍異國。</p>
<p>一個大雨滂沱，雪風凜凜的冬夜，他同幾個的從軍同學，一起赴敎導團部。他來向我辭行，那時他那副通紅的服圖，不禁使我也熱淚盈眶，說不出一句話來，臨別的剎那，我唯有緊握着他底凍破了皮的手他身上僅穿着幾件不够禦寒的單衣，脚上穿起草鞋凍得通紅，我當時眞替他担心怕着了凉。可是他回答我說「爲了國家那算甚麽？」</p>
<p>後來他到了印度給了我一封信，軍隊裏的生活不如理想那麼高，黑暗，專橫，不講理的丘八氣習，使許多智識靑年們精神爲之窒息。官僚作風摧毀了靑年們。口鋼鐵般的意志。許多敏感的同志憂憤因而自殺。但是爲了國家的生存，民族安危的一切，他從來沒有抱怨過一次，任勞任怨，克勤克儉，他說「多殺一個敵人，少花一顆子彈」。提他底的精神上的安慰。伊落瓦底江的洪流把他冲洗得那麼樣的堅强，野人山的峯　使他克服了不惡劣的環境。他常常來信說「當兵的生活才是人生的眞正戰鬥」。</p>
<p>曾經受過了兩次傷，最後在緬北的掃蕩戰中不幸陣亡了。當他底的死訊傳到我身邊的時候，翹首西望看天邊這夥巨星的隕落，伊落瓦底江的激流，最後使他得着眞理的歸宿，「爲國捐軀」的銜頭永遠掛在戰士們靈魂中。</p>
<p>勝利我們算是得到了，也可以說是僥倖。我究竟欺騙了他沒有呢？寫到此時不禁使我想起陸游的句詩「死去原知萬事空，但悲不見九洲同」我想他也許會有同感吧！</p>
<p>朋友，你底的希望也得着了最後的答覆，九泉下難道還不會瞑”嗎？可是，朋友，勝利已經一年多，而遍地還充滿了烽火，東北的同胞已重溫着成夢，還能不能够再永遠地安息下去吶，白山黑水又重蓋上烏雲濁流，他安眠在　國的土地裏，恐怕也在眷念遙遠的故土吧！已得勝利究竟在那裏？勝利屬於是那些人的？接收火員的金子，洋房，汽車，女人，成土的白骨，老百姓的血淚。他底的美夢被那些中華民國的罪人們粉粹得來，乾乾凈，辜負他底希望的就是那些人啊！。</p>
<p>喂，朋友，究竟是誰欺騙了你？已得復失的勝利，只好等得將來的歷史再來回答你吧！</p>

<p>鶴—「近衛爲什麽注意我這樣的小脚色？」</p>
<p>萍—「他先沒有注意，倒是參謀本部份子，和第五縱隊，把你抬川來的。」</p>
<p>鶴—「你想他現在很注意我嗎？」</p>
<p>萍—「他說你是少壯派的千里駒。」</p>
<p>鶴—「你怎麽知道的？」</p>
<p>萍—「靑木老師今天早晨吿訴我的。」</p>
<p>鶴—「靑木長老怎麽知道的呢？」</p>
<p>萍—「他先運川心靈術，替你去探察過；後來又用電話證實出來的。」</p>
<p>鶴—「「心靈術」……怎樣運用用？」</p>
<p>萍—「心靈術就是想想交通術，行術的人，集中自己思想，可以探察他人的思想。昨天在那德國人的車子裏，我不是提到過『玄術』的嗎？這心靈運用，就是玄術中的一種應用技能。</p>
<p>鶴—「那麼，你應該也會應用囉。」</p>
<p>萍—「早得很哩，我現在才入鬥，才做初步功夫。」</p>
<p>鶴—「試試看，你知道我心下有什麽事？」（鶴見躭心萍子，眞能運川心靈術。）</p>
<p>萍—「可以試試看，不過力量太小，行術的必需條件就多了，你先伸過手來，給我握着……」</p>
<p>兩人同時停止了脚步。萍子把鶴見的左手，握在自己的一雙手中。這樣有好多一會，然後萍子放下了自己的右手，只用左手與鶴見對握着。這時的月色較濃，把二人的身形射在沙灘上，印成很長的一雙黑影，相對站着。萍子一雙靈　的眸子，注視着鶴見。鶴見正顏端色，也瞧着萍子萍子却含着一臉　皮的淺笑。一會兒萍子發聲，說着鶴見的思想：</p>
<p>「你長得很美，也有些鬼聰明，可惜我不愛你，……（現在思想轉變了），是在搗鬼呢？還是眞有法術？（又變了）……我也會集中思想來抵抗，不讓你知道我在想什麼……，（又變了）集中一點……支那……不成……不能想這些……東京，也不好，天上的明月，很好……我想到月宮去休息一下……月宮是怎樣的呢？有山也有水？……」</p>
<p>萍子說到這裏，悠然把鶴見的手放下，扭轉身去，一雙手掩住自己的面門，竟嚶嚶啜泣起來。鶴見雖說意志堅强，到底也是血肉之軀，不能一點感情也沒有。這時看着萍子在試演心靈術的時候，陡然悲泣起來，知道萍子一定在集中心力的時候、功夫不深，用力過度，又因自己故意變化思想，故意强烈抗拒，以致她的心力忽逞　現象，因而引起感觸。禁不住忽然悲傷起來，覺得這個女子，對自己這樣痴情，倒也可憐。然而却是無法安慰她。竟窘得有些手足無措，呆呆地站在那裏。</p>

<p>半個月釆，上海市民已經受過兩次驚了，一次是因爲取締攤販而引起暴動，攤販原是小問題，何以由小變大，掀起軒然大波，爲的是攤販要吃飯！</p>
<p>攤販問题，甫吿解決，而江灣軍械分庫，又乒乒乓乓的爆炸起來了，起因到現在還沒有正式發表，不過據出事附近的士兵傳說：「在手溜彈搬運入庫之際，正値中午開飯之時，當時有一庫兵，喊一聲：「吃飯了」搬夫心不在焉，即將所負整箱手溜彈，任意傾卸，因此與地面撞擊而釀成巨禍。」如果傳聞屬實，這次巨禍的造成，也是爲了要吃飯！所不同者，攤販是因爲被打破了現有的飯碗，迫不得已，挺身而起，搬夫是有了飯碗因爲想到當今吃飯之難，聽到一聲開飯，心花怒放，一心要吃飯，疏忽了工作。就闖出巨禍。</p>
<p>兩次禍根，都是爲了要吃飯，「天下無如吃飯難，」洵不誣矣。</p>
<p>方今工商凋弊，百業蕭條，上海失業市民，至少在二百萬以上，爲了防止再度發生第三次第四次的不幸事件，希望關心民生的刺野，大家應該未雨而綢縿！</p>

<p>今天下午綠衣人來了，遞過來一封信，我一看，却正是這位友人寄來的，我很自然的明白了這封信裏應該說些的是什麽，於是跟着興奮而來的便是一個寒噤</p>
<p>我顫抖着，把信封拆開了。</p>
<p>「奇怪，怎麽祇是一個空信封，信丟到那裏去了？」當我拆開了它，發覺沒有一張信紙的時候，我不禁驚呌了起來。</p>

<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>在抗戰期內，曾委身敵偽的漢奸，又稱「落水人」，有人把他譯作“Waterman”。</p>
<p>但有人問這位譯者，倘然落水人神通廣大，搖身一變，勝利後仍居一官半職，試問這種人如何譯法？他說：這無疑地是”Waterproof“。</p>
<p>某男生對某女子單戀，他冒昧地寄她一封情書，可是稱呼很難措詞，他竟於信箋上以「美麗牌」瓜代某女士姓名。她接讀了莫明其妙，後來發覺美麗牌是“my　dear”，所以她非常憤恨，結果她也回他一信，信箋上以“good　year”瓜代某男生的姓名。他拆閱了對此“good　year”，不知何解，後來多方打聽，方知“good　year”是著名的豐年牌橡皮汽車胎。可謂以牙對牙，針鋒相對。</p>
<p>有一位外國社會學學者，硏究到中國的娼妓問題，其中有所謂「半開門」者，譯者把它譯爲half　open　door。那外人對此思索良久，喟然嘆曰：在外國祇有門羅主義與門戶開放政策，（open　door　plicy）尙未聽到過「半開門」。譯者也是一位十足的書生，他說這或許是折衷的辦法吧。</p>

<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>偶爾寫了一篇「誤人子弟」的故事，想不到引起了方成先生的「共鳴」。但對於「誤人子弟」之敎師，似乎頗表同情。</p>
<p>我原不敢多所搬弄是非，但我很武斷的說，無數曾經「誤人子弟」的先生，不能不感謝這一辯護。</p>
<p>我很慚愧，不僅大學門沒有跨過，即中學亦未畢業，戰爭影響個人求學，八年來一直奔波。因此，決心再度回到學校去。總算僥倖，居然以同等學力考入了一個專科學校。不料事實太令教失望了！我那篇赤裸裸的文章，就是身歷其境，而後下筆的。</p>
<p>我同情「秀才之罪」，時或寃枉，我同情敎書職業，十分淸苦，我也頗懂尊師重道，對老師似不該多所指責。然而，學校是什麽地方，難道竟容許官塲上「鬼混」的習氣闖進？</p>
<p>如果說黨團應該退出學校，那麽，「鬼混」的敎師，必須先退出學校。</p>
<p>上課前旣不加準備，上課時「噱頭濫好」，課外有課，題外有題，胡吹瞎扯，等到一半時間已過，便說：「對不起早退了，」這種敎師之「誤人子弟」，我想絕不是關王「寃枉了他！」</p>
<p>是的，抗戰後學生的程度是普遍低落了，但是正因爲這樣，我們希望先生們能多賣點氣力！也希望學校當周，多認眞些：方成先生執敎多年，覺得「誤人子弟」似係「欲加之罪」；字里行間，對於同行巧作隠隠約約的辦獲，那些鬼混的敎師會感激你，但是我們千千萬萬的苦苦求知的學生，則恰恰相反了。</p>

<p>前幾天有一位申報讀者，揭破了一幕新騙術：「近來有人專門奔走於各大旅社喜事人家，等到剛在舉行儀式的時候，他就封了一張十萬廿萬敵偽時期的期票，送上一份大禮，騙取一萬兩萬的合力，一天跑上十家八家收入相當可觀」。</p>
<p>這種騙術，倒不是乘人之危，而是乘人之喜。</p>
<p>其實乘人之喜的騙術，海上流行已久，除了上述者以外，還有冒充門生故舊，白吃喜酒，混跡於衆賓間，出入於新房裏，順手牽羊，竊取婦女衣飾者，亦時有所聞；不過做喜事人家，都是喜氣洋洋，一團和氣，大都不肯板起面孔，和人爭吵；，而且人之一生，能有幾次喜事，就是吃了一次小虧，也就算了。尤其現在舉辦喜事，大都男女家合在一起，兩宅來賓，互不相識。</p>
<p>這種乘人之喜的騙子，就在這種利的場合下施展着！</p>
<p>防制之法惟有：</p>
<p>（一）禮金交銀行代收，捐助慈善事業。</p>
<p>（二）銀行收款後，代發觀禮券，來賓憑券入塲。</p>

<p>報載協泰錢莊蔣玲弟蔣毛毛兩小孩，同時失踪，隔日忽在顧家公園中發現，由　丁報警送回，據兩小孩稱，當時有二人將其帶上汽車後疾駛而去，躭擱一宵後，不知如何，於翌晨送往這公園。此事頗覺可疑，是否爲仇人之惡作劇，抑別有企圖，一時尙未查明云云，確屬不可思議。茲據我友所知，近來類此事件，不止蔣姓兩孩，各家長因爲小孩毫無損賽，多一事不知少一事，所以都不追究。就是警局方面，也因爲這種舉動，旣非綁架勒贖，又非誘剝田鷄，所以也並不追究了。</p>
<p>然而他們吃飽了飯，沒事做，和小朋友開玩笑嗎？當然是不會的。據友人的推測，他們的目的物，是小孩的小便，說穿了似乎不値一笑，但是在中醫學說尙在發揚的時期，純潔的童便，是有錢　不到的珍品。因此他們不惜工本，用汽車來接送道種出品的小朋友們了。</p>
<p>現在有一種國藥，名呌「×石」，價値昂貴，超過人參，盛銷於南洋各埠。道藥的原料，就是用童便來煎煉成功的。十二歲以下好人家的肥白小孩，排出的小便，最爲合用，凡產後失調，陰虛久咳，以及肺勞吐血等病，服了都有奇效。以前在民國十六年的時候，杭州也有這種把戲出演，後被警局破案，却是一家藥材店老閩所幹的勾當，足見天下事，眞無奇不有了</p>

<p>A，極純凈的水（）</p>
<p>B，　骨湯或猪蹄子湯（）</p>
<p>C，食　水（）</p>
<p>（3）有一個玻璃杯子，它的容量恰恰是容得大體　爲1000c．c．的一塊冰，這時，冰塊的表面與杯口正是「一字平過」，不多不少。假如這杯子裏的冰倒下米，再灌以一百度的熱開水，也同樣的要　到與杯口「一字平過」的話，請問需要：</p>
<p>A僅僅1000c．c．熱開水呢？</p>
<p>B，毋需1000c．c．熱開水就可灌</p>
<p>C，仰或，需要1000c．c．以上的熱開水才可以灌滿呢？</p>
<p>（4）在一個刻有數量的量杯裏放下一塊體積已知的冰塊，杯口覆以玻環片以防水汽外溢，當時冰塊的溫度恰爲零度。其後慢慢因室溫而漸變爲水，再因加溫而變成然水。請問由冰到熟水，精密地說，其體積（c．c）上的變化是怎樣呢？是：</p>
<p>A，自始至終都相同，不增不减麽？</p>
<p>B，先一度减少而後慢慢增大麽？</p>
<p>C，抑或，自始至終都是朝向增加這一方向走呢？</p>
<p>〔5〕一公斤的冰塊（零度），灌以五十公斤的沸水（一百度），冰遇然則溶，請問，你以爲：</p>
<p>A，這一公斤的冰塊立即完全溶化爲水麽？</p>
<p>B，冰完全溶化後的水並且很溫暖麽？</p>
<p>C，抑或，倘若不憑室溫作爲補助，照數字上說，道些沸水還不能把道冰塊完全溶化呢？</p>
<p>〔6〕假如不憑室內溫度的幫助，大略的算算，你以爲要溶化一杯冰成爲水，需要幾杯（杯子容量相同）極熱的沸水）一百度）呢？（附註：沸水的蒸汽不算在內）</p>
<p>A，八十杯麽？</p>
<p>B，一百二十杯麼？</p>
<p>C，十杯麽？</p>
<p>〔7〕普通說水的冰點是零度。但請問一下：</p>
<p>A，凡是冰其溫度必是零度而毫無例外麽？</p>
<p>B，冰的溫度可能是在零度以下麽？</p>
<p>C，抑或，冰的溫度最低也必在零度呢？</p>
<p>〔8〕海洋和大湖表面結冰後，其底下尙有液體的海水湖水存在，那末，你以爲這兩者的水溫是：</p>
<p>A淡水的高於鹹水的呢？</p>
<p>B鹹水的高於淡水的呢？</p>
<p>C抑或，兩者都相同呢？</p>
<p>〔9〕使冰昇高溫度一度和使重量相同的水昇高溫度一度二者之間，你以爲那一種容易即所耗「熱量」較少呢？</p>
<p>A使冰昇高溫度比較容易呢？</p>
<p>B使水昇高溫度比較容易呢？</p>
<p>C抑或，兩者相同呢？</p>
<p>〔10〕將一公斤零度的冰塊加熱而變爲零度的冷水，這時所需要的熱量，你以爲相等於幾公斤由零度的冷水加熱爲與人體體溫相等（三十七度）的溫水的熟量呢？的略地說：</p>
<p>A相等於一如上述的一公斤冷水加熱而成溫水時所需的熱量麽？</p>
<p>B相等於一如上述二十公斤冷水的加溫麼？</p>
<p>C抑或，相等於一如上述八十公斤冷水的加溫呢？</p>

Since the review work of the comprehensive committee had not yet been completed, it was decided that the general assembly would be postponed until the 18th. During the meeting, there was also discussion about whether the general assembly should be further postponed, as the constitutional amendment work may take some time to complete. It is expected that this issue may be raised for discussion at the general assembly on the 18th. Rumors suggest that the general assembly will be postponed again until the 25th before it can conclude.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang summoned Kuomintang representatives Lei Zhen and others at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th to inquire about the draft constitution and instructed them to uphold the spirit of democracy and pass the draft constitution after consultation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] As the review of the draft constitution proceeds, Chairman Chiang, in order to respect the spirit of democracy, frequently discusses the matter with figures from the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party. At 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, he specifically summoned Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party to inquire about their attitude towards the draft constitution. Moreover, at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 15th, Xu Fulin and Jiang Yuntian visited Sun Ke at his residence to further exchange opinions on the draft constitution. According to a certain member of the Democratic Socialist Party, the chairman and his senior cadres are sincerely abiding by the spirit of consultation. A certain member of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: The reasons for our party's participation in the National Assembly are to (1) pass the draft constitution, (2) improve politics, and (3) end one-party rule and achieve national peace. If the principles of the draft constitution are changed, it would be tantamount to cutting off the road to peace. If peace talks succeed in the future, wouldn't this amended constitution have to be completely overturned again? Therefore, we do not believe that all parties must express satisfaction; at least, all parties must be able to accept it reluctantly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In order to make the revision of the draft constitution more democratic, the Kuomintang convened a tea party for Kuomintang National Assembly representatives on the 15th, organized by Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Chen Cheng, to exchange opinions. The meeting was held in two sessions, morning and afternoon, at the Lizhi Society. Wu and Chen delivered speeches, hoping that all representatives would discuss the revision of the draft constitution in the spirit of democracy and follow the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, adhering to the original draft agreed upon and not changing the principles. Subsequently, the representatives expressed their opinions separately, and the discussion was very lively.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen, in the name of the Kuomintang, hosted a banquet for the Democratic Socialist Party National Assembly delegation at noon on the 15th. Wu delivered a speech, stating that he hoped that all parties could complete this constitution in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. Xu Fulin then replied on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Party, stating that this constitution is not the constitution of the Kuomintang, nor the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Party, but the constitution of the Republic of China. That is why we are participating in the National Assembly. We are determined to adhere to this spirit and treat each other with sincerity to complete this constitution of the Republic of China. The atmosphere at the banquet was extremely harmonious.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Democratic Socialist Party leader Zhang Junmai, after reading the newspaper in Shanghai on the morning of the 15th, learned that the draft constitution had been revised during the review and that the motion to change two-thirds of the attendees to two-thirds of the entire body was not adopted. Party spokesman Jiang Yuntian told reporters again on the evening of the 15th that the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on the Republic of China being a democratic republic regarding the first article, and does not even agree with the original proposal. The party's opinion on revising the draft constitution is not that it should not be revised at all, but rather that it hopes it can be revised to be more democratic. The principle is that it must not be revised if it violates the original agreement and is arbitrarily modified. Then the Democratic Socialist Party will take appropriate action. When asked by reporters whether they would withdraw from the National Assembly, Jiang did not answer, only saying: Whatever attitude is the most irresponsible is the one we will take.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Second Meeting of the Comprehensive Committee: Continued Discussion on the Organization of National Assembly Representatives; Fierce Debate Erupted Over the Issue of Frontier Representatives <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Comprehensive Review Committee on the Draft Constitution held its second meeting at 10:50 AM on the morning of the 15th, with 122 representatives in attendance. Chairman Wang Shijie continued the discussion on the provisions of Article 26 of the draft constitutional amendment regarding the organization of National Assembly representatives. Bi Tianmin, a vocational representative from Hejiang, first questioned the comprehensive review committee's refusal to allow reporters to attend the meeting. Chairman Wang replied that it was a decision of the presidium. Then, Zeng Jikuan, a vocational representative from Jiangsu, argued that the number of representatives from municipalities directly under the central government should be specified. Liu Zongping, a Mongolian representative, argued that the number of representatives from frontier ethnic groups should also be specified in greater numbers. Fu Sinian believed that the provision in the first item, that one additional representative should be elected for every 300,000 people in regional elections, would make the National Assembly too large. The chairman then reported that the conveners' meeting had decided to amend it to one additional representative for every one million people, asking for everyone's consideration. Ruan Zhidao and others, vocational representatives from Sichuan, believed that this provision was too strict and opposed it, advocating for it to be changed to one additional representative for every 500,000 people. At this point, Li Zhongxiang argued that there should be no special provisions for women's elections. Pi Yishu rose to oppose, saying that in the current social situation, it would be difficult for women to win in regional elections, so provisions should be added to enhance women's rights. Jiang Yiping argued that regional elections and vocational elections should be given equal emphasis. Gu Zhenggang echoed from the side. Luo Jialun, Lin Bin, Du Guangxun, Wang Xiaoying, Huang Zhengqing, Kong Geng, and others also spoke in succession, but none made any specific proposals. The chairman suggested that, except for the first item concerning regional elections, which proposed to amend it to one additional representative for every 500,000 people, no amendments were proposed for the second, third, fourth, and fifth items. He proposed submitting the original review results to the general assembly, but some representatives still requested continued discussion. Bi Tianmin, Yang Dizhong, and others spoke in succession, firmly advocating for the addition of elections for indigenous peoples and for increasing the number of representatives allocated to Mongolians, Tibetans, and other minority ethnic groups. Opponents believed that the distribution of indigenous peoples was not regional and should not be listed outside of regional elections. As for the number of representatives from various minority ethnic groups, even if it were specified, it should be done according to proportion. The sound of debate reached the outdoors. The chairman's proposal to submit his review opinions to the general assembly was put to a vote, but it could not be resolved. No results were achieved by 12:00 noon, and the meeting adjourned in chaos.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Comprehensive Committee of the National Assembly continued its meeting at 3:40 PM, with 155 representatives in attendance, still chaired by Wang Shijie. First, he reiterated the powers of the Comprehensive Review Committee that had been clarified on the 14th, saying that the Comprehensive Review Committee, i.e., the Ninth Review Committee, was equal in status to the other eight review committees. Its power lies in discussing issues related to and involving principles across the various groups. The resolutions made cannot change the review opinions of the other eight review committees. If there are different review results, they will all be submitted to the general assembly. He also urged the representatives to speak on the topic, put forward concrete opinions, and save time. He then reported on the results of the convener's meeting at noon, submitting the organized specific articles to a vote. The first item of the review opinion on Article 26, "but those with a population of over 300,000," was amended to "500,000," and passed with 75 votes. The second item was amended to "Representatives elected from Mongolian banners (removing one "and" character), Tibet (adding seven characters) and other border regions (adding one character), their number shall be determined by law." It passed with 80 votes, but Liu Zongping and Mai Huanxin still spoke in succession, expressing their opposition to the second item. Liu insisted that the comprehensive review committee should consider the opinion of the Eighth Review Committee regarding the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups, and that the opinion of the conveners could not be hastily put to a vote, and it should not be thought that the majority oppresses the minority. Another group of representatives believed that the provisions for the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups were difficult to standardize and should be adapted to local conditions at any time. The spirit of another legal provision meeting is that the majority respects the minority, and the minority obeys the majority. The General Assembly has given utmost respect to the opinions of compatriots in the border areas. It cannot still be said that they have been suppressed. Force the majority to obey the minority. The heated debate unfolded again from this. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense again. Then Fu Sinian spoke, saying that since this case had already been voted on and passed, the discussion below should proceed quickly. The chairman also announced that if any representative did not agree with this vote, please reserve your opinion and express it at the general assembly. If you must submit a reconsideration to the Comprehensive Review Committee, then you must follow the procedures stipulated in the Initial Steps of Civil Rights. At this point, Liu Butong and Li Zhongxiang brought back the women's issue by returning to the meeting method, arguing that the election and proportion of women's numbers should be stipulated in the election law, and that the term "women's groups" in the fifth item of the review opinion of Article 26 was too vague, and that the scope and nature of it would easily cause the interpretation of the constitution, which would only cause disputes. They opposed listing this item in the constitution. Female representatives Gao Yiyun and Wang Xiaoying firmly opposed. Liu Butong also believed that the provisions for vocational elections in the fourth item were the same as the special provisions in the constitutions of various countries, and that the scope and nature of "vocational groups" were unknown, and there was a place to deprive universal suffrage rights, and also opposed listing it in the constitution. Zeng Jikuan and others also firmly opposed.</p>
<p>After two heated debates, Chairman Wang announced that these two items would be reserved and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>Liu Zongping spoke again, claiming that if the Comprehensive Review Committee does not reconsider its decision on the second item, the Mongolian representatives will unanimously oppose it in the General Assembly. Wang Guanying expressed sympathy, saying that the Comprehensive Review Committee's disregard for the review opinions of the Eighth Review Committee has the suspicion of abusing power. Gu Zhenggang reiterated the coordinating role that the Comprehensive Review Committee must have with the preservation of the fourth and fifth items, and for a time, criticisms were raging. Li Zhongxiang then stood up to ease the situation, saying that the chairman's statement that the issue would be reserved and submitted to the general assembly did not overturn the review opinion, nor did it fail to acknowledge the opinion of the meeting. He also suggested that the issue of the number of representatives elected from border ethnic groups be left for study, and that it be discussed again when the Eighth Review Committee reviews its opinion. Liu Zongping frequently spoke, firmly refusing to recognize the vote on the second amendment opinion. Women representatives, vocational representatives, border representatives, and indigenous representatives spoke in succession, each saying that they were right, and the order of the meeting place was chaotic. Fu Sinian's suggestion of one representative per Mongolian banner, and Huang Zhengqing's compromise opinion on the issue of indigenous peoples, were all drowned in the tide of debate. The remarks of other representatives were even more of a mixed chorus, unintelligible. At 5:20 PM, Chairman Wang had lost control of the entire meeting. He accepted Hu Shi's proposal to announce the adjournment of the meeting and continued to convene a joint meeting of the Presidium and the Conveners of the Comprehensive Review Committee to facilitate discussion and seek principles for resolving the problem. The representatives left in succession amidst discussions and deliberations.</p>
<h3 id="e3">National Assembly Representatives Pay Public Tribute to Liu Chuny: Chairman Chiang Attends and Presides Over the Ceremony; Ms. Liu's Coffin Will Be Transported Back to Her Hometown for Burial <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] All National Assembly representatives paid public tribute to the late Representative Liu Chuny at 10:00 AM on the 15th. The funeral hall was set up at the Public Recreation Club. A portrait of the late Representative Liu was hung in the center of the stage, with elegiac couplets from President Dai Chuanxian and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng on both sides. In the center of the stage front was a horizontal banner personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang, "Exemplar of the Nation's Talents," with an elegiac couplet from all the representatives of the National Assembly on both sides, which read: "Her integrity inspired for many years, in her daily life she often shed tears of concern for the world; the cold wind blows at midnight, it is difficult to forget the people who made thoughtful discussions in the front row." Wreaths were densely arranged on the stage and in front of it, and elegiac couplets and memorial banners were hung all around the walls and windows. The layout of the funeral hall was solemn and respectful. At 10:00 AM, the sacrificial ceremony began. Representative Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony, with Yu Youren and Hong Lanyou as the attendants. Hundreds of male and female representatives of the National Assembly, including Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhiben, and Ren Peidao, participated in the ceremony. After the presiding officer offered incense and flowers, Yi Gong read the eulogy. Finally, Peng Qizhi, the son of the late Representative Liu, kowtowed in thanks. The ceremony lasted for two and a half hours. Today, both morning and afternoon, representatives and friends of Ms. Liu during her lifetime continued to visit and pay their respects, showing great grief. It is reported that Ms. Liu's coffin will be transported back to her hometown for burial on the 20th.

<h3 id="e4">Sun Yaofu Discusses with Reporters About the President's Emergency Decree Power: It Is Not Appropriate to Add the Words "Emergency Accidents" to the Draft Constitution <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the amendment of Article 44 of the draft constitution by the Third Review Committee yesterday, adding the words "emergency accidents," Representative Sun Yaofu insisted on maintaining the original proposal at the time and raised objections to the addition of the four words, but the vote ultimately failed to pass. Mr. Sun solemnly stated to reporters that it should be recorded as follows: The power of emergency decrees was originally a symbol of the monarch in the imperial era. No such provision exists in democratic constitutional countries. In democratic countries, the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people cannot be infringed upon or restricted by administrative agencies. For fear that they would issue orders casually or on pretext to harm the people, prevention is taken beforehand, and the power to issue emergency decrees by the head of state is generally not listed. If very accidental events such as foreign invasion, internal rebellion, or disasters occur, the parliament may resolve to temporarily authorize the administrative agency to take emergency measures, to show that this power is in the hands of the people and the parliament, the representative of sovereignty. Article 40 of the draft constitution already has a special article on martial law, and the content of the martial law can include the handling of very accidental events such as foreign invasion, internal rebellion, and disasters. Even if it is necessary to formulate a separate emergency decree law outside of martial law, the original wording of Article 44 is sufficient to deal with it, and it is not appropriate to add the four words "emergency accidents," which are ambiguous and lack a definite definition, to reserve unlimited crises for the abuse of emergency decrees in the future. Considering the constitutional advanced countries of England and the United States, the regulations on martial law are also extremely strict. The outlines are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) In France, the parliament first formulates a martial law in peacetime, specifying the reasons, types, declaration agencies, and the results of the martial law declaration. If a real phenomenon occurs, the local officials and commanders will first implement martial law, and then the parliament will declare martial law. However, during the adjournment of the parliament, the president chairs the State Council and declares it after resolution. It is clear that this power is in the hands of parliament.</p>
<p>(2) The United Kingdom does not promulgate martial law in peacetime, and does not recognize the cabinet's power to issue emergency decrees in the event of a very accidental event. It must wait for the parliament to enact new laws before it can restrict the freedom of the people. However, local officials or military commanders can take emergency measures. After the event, the government consults with the parliament to pass an exoneration law to reduce the responsibility for illegal acts. Its system of preventing administrative personnel from abusing their power is stricter than the French system.</p>
<p>(3) The United States Congress and administrative agencies must exercise their powers in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Congress cannot have the power to change or restrict the freedom of the people like the British and French Congresses, but it has not been seen to delay the opportunity to deal with very accidental events.</p>
<p>In short, the freedom of the people is sacred and inviolable. In today's China, those who discuss the constitution should strive to protect the freedom of the people and prevent the government from overstepping its authority to deprive people of their rights. Therefore, if the power of emergency decrees cannot be fundamentally abolished, at most it can only be limited to the scope stipulated in the original Article 44, limited to natural disasters or major changes in national financial economics, and it is not appropriate to add the four words "emergency accidents."</p>

Finally, it was decided that the Anhui National Assembly representatives, the Beijing Anhui Fellow Villagers Association, and the Student Homeland Salvation Association would consult on a plan and appeal separately.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Wang Yuyang Reports on the Recent Situation in Dalian: Hopes That the National Army Will Receive It Quickly; The Lushun-Dalian Fellow Villagers Association Writes to Chairman Chiang <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Lushun-Dalian Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing entertained the press at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. Chairman Mu Chao gave a preliminary introduction to Lushun and Dalian, saying that Lushun-Dalian covers an area of 2,462 square kilometers with a population of 180,000, 500,000 near the urban area, and a coastline of 3,100 kilometers. The climate is mild and the products are abundant. Militarily, it is the best ice-free port in the East of our country. As early as 1905, Japan occupied it as a base, designated it as the so-called "Kwantung State" and organized the Kwantung Army, which eventually eroded the Northeast and even peeped into our entire country. This clearly shows the importance of its position, but this also makes it easier to arouse the ambition of foreigners to invade. I hope that the people of the country will not ignore the Lushun-Dalian issue. Wang Qiamin, a representative of the National Assembly in Dalian, said: I was born in Lushun. I remember that when I was born, Lushun-Dalian was under the occupation of Japanese imperialism, and I have never seen the shadow of the national flag. The compatriots there are in a dark and bitter sea every day. I hope the government will lend a helping hand. In the middle, I cited many examples. Then Wang Yuyang, the Dalian National Assembly representative who had just come to Beijing from Dalian, reported on the recent situation in Lushun-Dalian, hoping that the government would go to receive it as soon as possible to save the people from suffering. The association also prepared a letter to Chairman Chiang, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The people of Lushun-Dalian have been trapped in a sea of ​​misery for a long time. Please send the national army to receive them quickly to relieve the people from suffering. (2) The representatives of the National Assembly of Dalian City illegally used the candidate from Liaoning to replace them, ignoring the rights of Dalian, and expressed their resistance. (3) The youth of Lushun and Dalian fled to various places because they could not bear the oppression of the Communist army. I sincerely request the government to provide practical relief and organize them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] According to Wang Yuyang, a member of the "Lushun-Dalian Catholic Association," when he left Dalian on September 15, the Chinese Communists controlling the area were using Japanese machinery and workers to manufacture munitions and ammunition. Although Wang was unwilling to discuss the situation of the Soviet Union in Lushun and Dalian, he admitted when questioned by reporters that the Chinese Communists had taken over the Dalian Municipal Government from the Soviet army. He said that the Soviet army stationed in Dalian on August 23, 1945, organized a Chinese police force, and established a municipal government two months later, under the control of the Chinese Communists. Mayor Jia Zixiang (transliteration) was appointed by the Chinese Communists and "completely unqualified." Deputy Mayor Chen Yandao (transliteration) carried armed forces and a large amount of cash to buy workers to support him.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Impressions of Inspecting the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region: American Reporter Discusses Reasons for Communist Military Failures <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 13th] Christopher Gerrien, a correspondent for Time Magazine stationed in Beijing, recently toured the Jin-Cha-Sui border region and gained a profound understanding of the wanton destruction perpetrated by the Communist troops. He firmly believes that the Communist military failures in the region are not only of great military significance, but also have a significant impact on their internal morale. Gerrien recently wrote an article in the magazine detailing his impressions of the inspection. His original dispatch begins by stating, "The 'New Democratic Politics' implemented by the Chinese Communists in the strategic northwest region abandoned by the Japanese army a year ago has failed due to mismanagement, mirroring the failure of their military plans. This is the conclusion I have reached after experiencing hardships and touring the Jin-Cha-Sui border region." Gerrien then titled a section "Showcase of Destruction," describing the situation in Zhangjiakou: "Zhangjiakou is vital to the economic life of the Jin-Cha border region. The Japanese left behind considerable economic construction. After the Japanese surrender, most of this construction remained intact, and the Communists used it as a corridor connecting Yan'an and the Northeast, and as a showcase to advertise their 'Democratic Politics.' However, not only were they unable to defend this area militarily, but they also destroyed this 'showcase' as government troops approached. In China, a country plagued by poverty and depleted resources, this act of destruction is truly heartbreaking. For weeks after the Communist retreat, Zhangjiakou's water and electricity supply had not been restored. The train station had become a graveyard for wrecked locomotives. The workers' dormitories were reduced to rubble. The Communists set fire to the post office on what they called 'Liberation Road,' and the telephone bureau opposite, which served four thousand users, is now a pile of debris. In addition to destroying transportation and telecommunications facilities, the Communists destroyed fifty-two factories, leaving three thousand workers and their families homeless."</p>
<p>Gerrien next titled a section "Temporary Pain," explaining the scorched-earth policy implemented by the Communists in Kouquan. He wrote: "The Kouquan coal mine is located ten miles outside of Datong, a city of 800,000 people that was besieged for forty-five days. Nearby is one of North China's largest power plants. The Communists captured Kouquan on August 1 and withdrew on October 31 after encountering government troops. When they withdrew from Kouquan, they engaged in similar large-scale destruction. Iron smelters and engine lathes were all destroyed. Burnt-out locomotives were everywhere. Broken metal equipment and rubble were strewn all over. In their political propaganda, the Communists claim that this destruction is a 'temporary pain,' but in war-torn China, the phrase 'temporary pain' has become the most bitter of terms. At the same time, the Communists have lost the most important thing in their guerrilla strategy: the support of the people."</p>
<p>Finally, Gerrien titled a section "Changing Moods," describing the wavering morale among Communist personnel. According to him, "Behind the barbed wire of a Communist prisoner concentration camp in Zhangjiakou, the following phenomenon was discovered: the morale of the Communist soldiers has been steadily declining. It is no wonder that the general soldiers lack fighting spirit when they enter an endless civil war filled with thorns and turn against their compatriots. One of the Communist soldiers, Wang Youming, joined the army at the age of seventeen and fought in many battles. He has now been promoted to the rank of deputy company commander and was wounded four times in the war against Japan. In September, when General Fu Zuoyi's troops advanced towards Zhangjiakou, Wang Youming and his forty-odd subordinates were ordered to defend Jining. As government troops approached, twenty-three of his subordinates were killed in action, and Wang was forced to retreat. In a state of extreme confusion, Wang asked himself, 'Why are Chinese people fighting Chinese people?' Why did we have to die in Jining? Later, Wang was questioned by a Communist political instructor (a devout believer in Communism who had participated in the 25,000-li Long March). During the conversation, Wang frankly admitted that his conscience told him he could no longer fight in the civil war. The instructor pondered for a moment and then told Wang, 'If that is truly how you feel, then you should rest. You must consider this carefully, and when your mood changes, you can return to your post.' The so-called 'rest' meant being sent to the mountains in the rear under surveillance. Afterwards, the instructor visited Wang repeatedly, but Wang's mood remained uneasy, and he said, 'I need to think more. I suffered countless hardships fighting the Japanese, but I had no regrets, because at that time my conscience was fighting alongside me. But now my conscience does not allow me to do what I am doing.' Before long, government troops recovered Zhangjiakou, and Wang's unit retreated into the mountains. Wang deliberately lagged behind the unit, wrote a letter of surrender to the government troops, contacted a certain unit of the government army, and his conscience regained its freedom."</p>

<h3 id="e25">Pauley Submits Report to Truman on Inspection of Northern Korea; Soviets Seek to Control Administrative and Economic Power <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Edwin Pauley, the U.S. reparations commissioner, submitted his six-day inspection report of northern Korea (Soviet-occupied territory) to President Truman. The report stated that the Soviet Union's objective may be to force the establishment of a Moscow-controlled government throughout Korea and then agree to withdraw its troops. Pauley's investigation team of nineteen people entered northern Korea accompanied by a squad of Soviet soldiers equipped with American rifles. The Soviets directly and firmly prevented the Americans from talking to Koreans, even saying that they would shoot the Americans' interpreter. At one point, a Soviet general told Pauley that the Americans would regret it if they did not stop taking photographs. Pauley said that when he first met with General Chistiakov, the commander of Soviet forces in Korea, Chistiakov could not agree on the area that the American investigation team was to visit. Pauley then used diplomatic tactics, presenting Chistiakov with a beautiful sword, and the two had a more harmonious second meeting. Chistiakov reciprocated by giving Pauley a beautiful dagger and serving him a typical Russian dinner, with an ample supply of vodka, exceeding the drinking limit several times. Pauley said, "When the investigation team passed by factories, the train would speed up, which may have been coincidental, but it is also uncertain." When the Soviet side claimed that a certain machine tool factory did not exist, Pauley ordered his Korean translator, Mr. Zhang, to try to find it. Pauley said, "This was a rather important task because the Soviet officers ordered Soviet and Korean translators to surround Mr. Zhang. Every move of this person was bound to be monitored, and every question was met with shouts. They clearly did not want us to obtain any information from the Koreans." The factory was finally discovered next to a certain power plant, but the equipment in the power plant had been completely removed. Pauley found that industry in northern Korea was still active, unlike the destruction of industry in the nine eastern provinces of China, but the Soviets seemed to be promoting communism to the people and seeking to control all administrative and economic power. Banners hung in the streets praising the Soviet government as "the highest form of democracy." However, there were some signs that the Koreans were not fully cooperating with the Soviet occupying forces. Pauley said, "After dusk, incidents between Soviet troops and Koreans were endless. General Chistiakov had to issue an order stipulating that no Soviet soldier could travel alone after dusk. However, two or three Soviet soldiers were still killed each time. The Koreans had no weapons other than stones."</p>

Letters were sent to students in various counties to report to the province, and more than 500 people have reported. Each person paid 101,000 yuan in advance for tuition and miscellaneous fees, and more than 50 million yuan has been collected (more than 20 million yuan has been spent, and the remainder has been sealed).

<h3 id="e40">Looking Ahead to the Blum Cabinet's Future <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>After French Socialist leader Léon Blum was elected Prime Minister with the support of various French parties, he began to form a cabinet. In recent days, he has consulted with leaders of various parties on the matter of cabinet formation and is expected to complete the task within days. Post-war France is also experiencing times of great difficulty, and the people of the country are eagerly hoping that the new cabinet can be established as soon as possible to cope with the various difficult problems currently facing them. According to a broadcast speech to the nation by Blum himself, he also hopes that the new cabinet can be formed within days so that he can attend the National Assembly tomorrow, and also expressed his hope that the new cabinet will be established as soon as possible, even more urgently than anyone else. Based on this, it is naturally certain that the new French cabinet, under the leadership of former Popular Front leader Blum, will be organized and completed within days.</p>
<p>Post-war France, although also a country with many difficulties, especially in terms of finance and economics, has many holes and sores. It is really not an easy task to talk about revival and prosperity; however, French politics in the year since the war has made considerable progress. Some people call France a newly emerging European nation, which is not an exaggeration. In the past year, France has held several general elections, and the results have consistently shown the advantage of left-wing parties. Whether in the National Assembly or the Senate, the Communist Party is in a leading position, but the number of seats won by its rival party, the Popular Republican Movement, is not much different. Therefore, the Communist Party cannot obtain a vast majority on any issue if it does not receive the support of the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Left Wing Alignment Movement. For example, in this National Assembly election of the Prime Minister, Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez did not obtain the necessary number of votes, resulting in his defeat. In the second vote, the Popular Republican Movement candidate, the current interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, followed in Thorez's footsteps and failed. This phenomenon is rarely seen in the history of political parties in various countries. Finally, as a result of talks among the leaders of various parties, it was decided to support Socialist leader Blum as a candidate for Prime Minister, and submit it to the National Assembly for a vote. With the unanimous support of members of various parties, he finally obtained the necessary number of votes and was elected. However, it goes without saying that the foundation of the Blum cabinet is entirely based on compromises among various parties and is not very solid.</p>
<p>However, looking at the economic situation in France and looking back at the international environment, the most suitable candidate to take on the role of Prime Minister at this time is none other than Blum. The reason is very simple, because the most serious problem currently facing the French government is the financial problem. France suffered greatly in the Second World War, and was also ravaged by the German occupation. Its vitality was greatly damaged, and it was not easy to recover for a while. Therefore, since France gained liberation, the lives of the French people have not been improved by liberation; if they want to revive and prosper in the future, they must find ways to obtain economic assistance from foreign countries. Blum, in the spring and summer of this year, did not hesitate to endure the hardship of long journeys and traveled to London and Washington to visit the British and American authorities and negotiate Anglo-French and Franco-American economic agreements, all of which have achieved significant results. Therefore, Blum not only knows the domestic economic situation in France very well, but also, judging from the current situation, only Blum can take on the difficult task to solve France's current economic difficulties.</p>
<p>As for the international environment in post-war France, France is situated between the Slavic and Anglo-American blocs, and often feels the pain of being in a difficult position on both sides. It goes without saying that the situation is difficult. In the past ten months or so, France's foreign policy has indeed achieved considerable success under the wise leadership of Foreign Minister Bidault. Especially in successive international conferences, France has stood in the middle of the two major blocs, mediating disputes, doing its best to mediate, and acting as a bridge to connect the opinions of both parties, making significant contributions to the achievements of successive international conferences. However, the joys and sorrows of international relations have their objective factors and cannot be controlled by any one country. Foreign Minister Bidault sometimes feels frustrated and powerless. Therefore, the French politician who must take on the difficult task at this moment must be a figure who can be welcomed by both sides, and Blum is the most suitable candidate with this dual personality.</p>
<p>The French are the nation with the most opinions, and everyone has their own unique views on politics. Reflected in politics, this has formed a phenomenon of numerous small parties. Therefore, party politics in France is the worst of the democratic advanced countries. In particular, ordinary politicians spread rumors, stirred up trouble, and caused political tides in France to emerge one after another, and the political situation rarely remains stable, so that established national policies are not easily implemented. This is the worst thing about French politics before the war. Although politics has progressed after the war, this unfortunate phenomenon still exists, which makes us unable to harbor excessive expectations for the future of the Blum cabinet. Therefore, general political observers are not overly optimistic about the future of the Blum cabinet, and deeply fear that the Blum cabinet is a transitional government, and its life will not be long. Moreover, although Blum himself served as Prime Minister of the Popular Front cabinet in 1936 and has rich political experience, he is old and his health is worrying. Can he take on this important task for a long time? This is still a serious problem.</p>
<p>However, what France urgently needs at the moment is political stability. It must not be like the pre-war era, with political tides rising and falling one after another, so that the country's established policies cannot be implemented. The leaders of various parties should accept the lessons of France's defeat in World War II, put the interests of the country above those of the party, and be able to work together with one heart to strive for France's revival. Even if the Blum cabinet is a temporary transitional government, it will be able to open up a new path for the various parties to cooperate and jointly seek France's recovery in a short period of time. This is the common expectation of people inside and outside France for the Blum cabinet; it is also Blum's own wish.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Paying Attention to Northern Jiangsu Without Neglecting Southern Jiangsu. Jiangsu Province's Politics Are Gradually Returning to Normal. Efforts Are Being Made to Restore Order and Establish Security. <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Zhang Yulin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial News Office, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. The reporter asked about the recent political situation in Jiangsu. He said that among the 63 counties and cities in the province, except for a very small number of counties in northern Jiangsu that are still awaiting recovery, the general situation has shown significant progress. The provincial government will pay full attention to northern Jiangsu, but will not neglect southern Jiangsu at the same time. The provincial government's temporary office has now been established in Huaiyin, and Shan Gong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is in charge of all emergency matters in the recovered areas. Chairman Wang Maogong will frequently travel back and forth between Huaiyin and Zhenjiang, and will inspect the recovered counties at any time. On the eve of his departure for Huaiyin, Chairman Wang convened the heads of various provincial units to review and instruct the work of various departments, promising to pay attention to "restoring order and establishing security," and will strive to coordinate politics with military affairs to achieve the task of pacification. As for the refugees stranded in northern Jiangsu, the Social Affairs Department is working with the Suning Branch to expedite their repatriation. The situation of land tax collection throughout the province is good, and highways are being actively developed. The budget revenue and expenditure for the provincial and county local budgets in the 36th year are severely insufficient, making the compilation extremely difficult. The land registration and education of various counties in northern Jiangsu are of great importance, and appropriate measures have been formulated to facilitate their implementation. The establishment of security throughout the province and the implementation of health administration are particularly active. The county magistrate examination will be held in the shortest possible time, and the provincial training corps is training transferred military officers. Once they graduate, they can be assigned to positions. Generally speaking, Jiangsu's politics are gradually returning to normal.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th Dispatch] The new county magistrate, Mr. Shen Chenglong, received reporters from our newspaper at his residence in the afternoon of the 15th and made an important speech on the administrative guidelines for the future: I have been ordered to be the county magistrate of Wu County and will follow the will of the provincial authorities and the expectations of the people. I will formulate plans for promoting general administration according to the urgency of local needs. It is difficult to be specific at present, but the focus will be on (1) education, (2) construction, and (3) city appearance. Moreover, I sincerely decided on two major principles of governance: (1) personnel selection should be fair and based purely on talent; (2) in the use of money, at this time of popular shortage and financial constraints, we should strive to reduce expenditure. Therefore, some redundant county-level structures will be abolished. Shen also said that preparations are being made to complete the merger of townships in the 36th year. In the future, the 保長 (bao trưởng, village head) in each township will implement a new system. However, this expense is not included in the county budget and will be allocated from the profits of township production to enable sound grassroots politics. After this, the appointment of township chiefs can also be strictly selected.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu Dispatch] Changshu County borders the Yangtze River, and low-lying farmlands account for one-third of the county. Existing dikes were built to prevent flooding, but due to years of neglect, the base of the dikes has loosened. This year, the water level suddenly rose, causing the Jinjia Dike between Zhuang and Cheng, as well as farmlands in Dongtang Town, Renyang, Shipai, Hengjing, and Bai regions, to be submerged. River water overflowed, making it difficult to plant crops, resulting in severe losses. The Dike Repair Committee has decided to urgently repair the dikes, establishing engineering offices in Guli Village, Dongtang Town, and Xinzhuang, which are located in the central areas of the dike region. Once funding is allocated, surveying and earthwork will commence. It is estimated that the entire project will require at least fifty clear days to complete and construction can begin around the Qingming Festival next year.</p>

However, Sichuan Province's finances are currently very difficult, with a budget shortfall of 25 billion next year. New undertakings will require vast expenses, making the promotion of new policy construction even more difficult. Deng Hanxiang, Director of the Provincial Department of Finance, has decided to fly to Beijing within days to request a solution from the central government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jiaxing Dispatch] As the townships in this county urgently need firearms for self-defense during the winter defense period, they had previously applied for their issuance. The provincial authorities have approved the allocation of civilian self-defense firearms to this county, totaling only 100 rifles and 4 machine guns, which is far fewer than the originally requested number. Therefore, the county government will distribute them by lottery. Townships with strong self-defense forces will be given less, or not at all, while townships with weak self-defense forces will be strengthened. It will also organize urban national guard and police reserve teams to strengthen local security.</p>

<p>Suzhou County Farmers' Association Requests Prohibition</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The Farmers' Association of this county recently reported that farmers are often obstructed and delayed when paying grain tax to the collection offices, and that tax collectors extort 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per mu when distributing notification slips, increasing the burden on farmers. This not only causes great suffering for farmers but also has a significant impact on the future of taxation. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened on the 13th to discuss measures to stop this practice. It was decided to send Chairman Zhu Xijun to the Grain Office for negotiations and to petition the county government to issue a strict prohibition to alleviate the burden on farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Salesmen Compete to Purchase and Transport - Chaos in the Bengbu Salt Market <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu Dispatch] The prices in the Huai salt sales area suddenly became unbalanced. As the prices here are relatively low, salesmen competed to purchase and transport salt outwards, rushing to be the first. Supply could not meet demand, and salesmen repeatedly caused disturbances at the Transportation Association. As a result, the salt market has been in a chaotic state for the past ten days. While sales were brisk, there was little salt left in warehouses, and scheduled sales were suddenly interrupted. There are currently over 200,000 dan of Huai salt stockpiled at the Pukou Railway Station. However, due to the scarcity of vehicles, loading and transportation are relatively slow, resulting in a sharp decline in recent deliveries. Bengbu City and nearby counties are brewing trouble, and disputes have repeatedly arisen within the Transportation Association due to the demand exceeding supply, undermining its prestige. It is imperative that the authorities devise a way to increase supply, maintain order, and ensure the availability of salt to the people, while curbing competitive purchases.</p>

The Command sent officers to Suzhou to secretly investigate in conjunction with local military and police agencies. After several days of effort, it was discovered that Lu Jingxuan, the current secretary of the County Provisional Council and headmaster of the County Middle School, was acting suspiciously and was highly suspected. He was immediately arrested and detained at the Suzhou Garrison Command for strict interrogation. However, relevant parties are remaining tight-lipped about the details of the case.</p>

<p>Excessive Valuation of House Tax in this City</p>
<p>Having read the article by lawyer Lu Xinghou in your esteemed newspaper criticizing the inappropriate house tax in this city, I find it truly reflects the public opinion of the citizens. However, lawyer Lu spoke from a legal standpoint, only addressing the points where it fails to comply with the law, and has not yet discussed the actual situation of excessive and inflated valuations. I would like to add the following to illustrate the suffering of the citizens under this heavy tax. The most unreasonable aspect of the autumn house tax payment notice issued by the Finance Bureau is that it only seeks to increase revenue by arbitrarily inflating rental values, disregarding reality. For example, the house I rent had a monthly rent of 90 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (as evidenced by the landlord's house certificate, with only 270 yuan per quarter), but the Finance Bureau assessed it at 4,500 yuan, collecting 450,000 yuan in house tax and municipal tax, exceeding the actual rent by more than ten times. Before the war, the usual rent for a house in Hongkou was at most 100 to 200 yuan per month, as those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know. Now, the Finance Bureau has assessed it at a staggering 1,500 yuan, perhaps because they have just flown in from Chongqing and are unaware of the situation in Shanghai. Furthermore, for Shanghai houses, except for those rented out by private individuals where contracts, account books, and house certificates may be forged and unreliable, those rented out by formal banks have well-organized account books and receipts, providing legitimate evidence that cannot be denied. However, the Finance Bureau does not rely on the legitimate documents from the 26th year of the Republic to calculate the house tax, but instead relies on imagination, arbitrarily assessing the value, which is not legal. Moreover, the former Municipal Council had a good precedent for the house tax valuation method, which the Finance Bureau has not adopted. It is said that the house tax files of the former Municipal Council are available, and the Finance Bureau can consult them to calculate the rent based on the house tax amount of the 26th year of the Republic, which would be more accurate. However, it does not do so, resulting in arbitrary assessments that resemble extortion. All of us citizens should protest in unison and request the Finance Bureau to revoke these illegal valuations and reassess the tax amount based on the actual rent to alleviate the suffering of the people. I also urge the councilors who have seen this report to promptly propose a motion for correction. (Chen Guanyu)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Two Lingbi Stones Cause a Sensation in Yangzhou City <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Yangzhou Dispatch: Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>After reading the title of this article, readers may wonder: "What? Two stones actually caused a stir in Yangzhou?" The reporter's answer is: "Yes."</p>
<p>Love of Antiques, Buying Stones</p>
<p>The matter originated with Liang Diancheng, the owner of the Sanhe Canggongke restaurant here. This Mr. Liang has always been a well-known antique enthusiast, especially for calligraphy and paintings. To put it bluntly, his love is almost eccentric. When traveling outside or socializing, if he encounters genuine pieces by famous artists and can buy them with money, he will not hesitate to spend heavily to acquire them. If the owner of the piece is not concerned about money, he will spare no effort, rack his brains, rely on friends' relationships, or use other flattering methods to get what his heart desires.</p>
<p>A friend of Mr. Liang, Shen Dakezhu, had a batch of calligraphy and paintings last year that he had promised to sell to him. At that time, Mr. Liang paid a deposit of 900,000 yuan to Shen. Later, Shen sold the calligraphy and paintings to someone else. As a result, Mr. Liang naturally became Shen's debtor for 900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The month before last, in order to repay Liang's debt of 900,000 yuan, Shen used two Lingbi stones that he had stored at home as collateral. People who love calligraphy and paintings will also be interested in stones. In addition, these two stones were indeed somewhat unusual. When struck, they emitted a sound like a "qing" (a chime stone instrument). Liang Dian, who has always had a keen eye for antiques, thus, in a situation that was not exactly a transaction but was in fact a transaction, one afternoon, these two Lingbi stones were carried from Shen's home to Liang's house by several employees of Liang's company.</p>
<p>Exquisite Shape, Suitable for Appreciation</p>
<p>It took several employees to carry them, so the weight of the two stones can be imagined. At the same time, this was due to the presence of foam wood bases. The shape of the stones was that of a reclining dragon. On the surface, the color and texture of the stones did not seem much different from ordinary Qingshan stones. However, when struck, they did emit a metallic sound. The reporter's residence is in Mr. Liang's house, so I know this clearly. However, the other virtues of the stones remained a mystery to the reporter. At most, they were "exquisite in shape and suitable for appreciation."</p>
<p>The stones had been placed in Mr. Liang's flower hall for a week when the trouble began. It started when the stones were being carried out of Shen Dake's house.</p>
<p>Tribute of the Late Qing, Invaluable</p>
<p>It turned out that when the employees were carrying the stones on the road, Mr. Tang Shumei, a former teacher at the Eighth Middle School, caught sight of them and immediately took notice, following them all the way to the entrance of Liang's house. Because: Mr. Tang knew that in the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office (i.e., the former site of the Eighth Middle School), there were two Lingbi stones. It was said that those two Lingbi stones were purchased in Anhui during the late Qing dynasty by the Yangzhou salt merchant Huang Yingtai and were prepared as tribute to be presented to the Qianlong Emperor. However, Qianlong died before they could be presented, so they were left in the Yangzhou Prefectural Office. Thus, Mr. Tang was concerned because he believed that the two Lingbi stones that Liang Dian had bought were public property from the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office.</p>
<p>Was it out of concern for public property, or out of cherishing public property, ultimately to protect public property? Mr. Tang Shumei reported what he had seen to the county government. After receiving the report, the county government sent personnel to investigate and then had the stones in Liang's house carried to the county government. As a result, rumors spread like wildfire in society. Some said that the two stones could be sold for tens of millions of yuan and cited an example of a foreigner who had wanted to buy them. Some said that the two stones were priceless because otherwise, how could they have been used as tribute to the Emperor?</p>
<p>Public or Private Property, Awaiting Judgement</p>
<p>After this trouble arose, Liang Diancheng stated that if the stones belonged to the public, they could be returned to the public. The purchase price of 900,000 yuan could be counted as used for other purposes. However, another rumor then circulated in society, saying that he had stolen public property. He became anxious when he heard this because during the enemy-puppet period, the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office had been occupied by the enemy for eight years, and no one had ever gone to see whether the two Lingbi stones were still there. Even Mr. Tang Shumei, who reported the matter to the county government, was the same. After the victory, the National Army was stationed there, and naturally, no one would have bothered to go and see the condition of the two stones.</p>
<p>However, Liang Dian, who was in trouble, was different. In addition to confirming with Shen Dake that the two Lingbi stones he had sold him were indeed not public property, he ran to the old Yangzhou Prefectural Office to look for the public's two Lingbi stones everywhere. As a result, he found one in a pile of horse manure. Accompanied by the local gentleman Hu Xianbo, he inspected it and said that the stone was indeed the original one. Thus, Liang Diancheng even took a photo of the stone. However, the other stone has not yet been found, so the matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 8th), the county government, in order to emphasize public property and respect the reporter's spirit of protecting public property, originally planned to invite well-known figures in Yangzhou society, including Shi Zongying, Chen Hanguang, Dai Xingyi, Bao Xiangzhong, Zhu Ganchen, Yang Zuojie, and other gentlemen, to the county government to jointly appraise whether the two stones that Liang Diancheng bought from Shen Dake were indeed not public property in order to resolve this case. As a result, because not all of those invited arrived, an appraisal could not be made. Thus, this case is still being watched by all the people of Yangzhou today (11th).

<h3 id="e72">United Nations General Assembly Declares Adjournment - Foundation for Lasting Peace Laid - Disarmament Charter Passed by Assembly - South African Union's Request to Annex Southwest Africa Rejected <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The second part of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded, effectively marking the formal establishment of the UN organization. As such, the foundation for humanity's pursuit of lasting peace through collective action has been laid. The first part of the first session was held in London earlier this year. During the two parts of the session, the major organs of the United Nations have been established. The Security Council and the Economic and Social Council were established in London, and the Trusteeship Council was established in New York following today's vote. With this, the entire plan has been declared complete.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly, amidst cheers, passed the "Disarmament Charter," urging all nations to limit and universally reduce their maintained armaments. Universal disarmament, stipulating effective guarantees to ensure compliance by participating nations, and establishing regulations for the control of the atomic bomb. The final version of the resolution passed consists of nine sections. Last night, when British Foreign Secretary Bevin, US Secretary of State Byrnes, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov discussed it, they all delivered lengthy speeches, extending past midnight before concluding. However, today it was passed after only half an hour of discussion. The only speakers today were Canada's Martin and France's Parodi, both of whom ardently supported the proposal. British representative Shawcross had endorsed this proposal in the committee and revealed that a disarmament conference would be convened within six months. Last night's discussion saw friends of the representatives and the public filling the meeting hall to listen to the three foreign ministers' eloquent speeches in support of the proposal. Today, feeling fatigued, and with the General Assembly swiftly concluding the matter, the attendance was not as crowded as last night. Although Molotov and Vyshinsky had worked hard to express the Soviet Union's views during the debate, they were not present today to witness their work achieve final satisfactory results.</p>
<p>In addition to passing the "Disarmament Charter" today, the General Assembly also passed the following resolutions: (1) The United Nations' budget for the coming year, totaling US$27.74 million, including US$601,800 for the International Court of Justice. The United States is to pay 39.89%, the United Kingdom 11.48%, the Soviet Union 6.34%, and China and France 6% each. (2) Concerning the plan proposed by the Political and Security Committee on the issue of investigating foreign stationed troops of member states. The Soviet representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, expressed dissent regarding this plan, requesting that the information to be provided by the member states should include detailed information on general armaments at the same time, otherwise it would still be insufficient. The Soviet Union's position remains that the issue of foreign stationed troops should be considered together with the issue of troops maintained within their own countries. Therefore, he requested that the Security Council decide what information is necessary for the implementation of disarmament, and requested that the United Nations General Assembly decide whether the investigation of member states' troops should be limited to their foreign stationed troops or should also include troops maintained within their own countries. Finally, the General Assembly submitted the military investigation plan proposed by the Political and Security Committee to a vote, passing it with 36 votes to 6. The major powers all voted against, and four national representatives abstained. (3) Regarding the trusteeship issue, the draft resolution proposed by the representatives of Denmark, India, and the United States, arguing that the South African Union should not annex its mandated territory of Southwest Africa, was also passed by a majority of 37 votes, with nine national representatives abstaining. In addition, Mexico and Iraq each received 36 votes and 34 votes, and were elected as member states of the Trusteeship Council. The General Assembly adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Trusteeship Council Established - Ten Nations Including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union Appointed as Council Members <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] The General Assembly today established the Trusteeship Council, with the main objective of enabling millions of non-self-governing people around the world to eventually achieve independence. This is the last major organization established within the United Nations structure, and together with the already established Security Council, Economic and Social Council, International Court of Justice, and Secretariat, it completes the world peace organization as stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Initially, the Trusteeship Council will only supervise the administration of eight trust territories, all of which were former League of Nations mandated territories, with a total population of 15 million people. However, it is hoped that one day, the entirety or a majority of the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack full independence will be brought under its governance. The main objective of the Council is to gradually lead all territories under its supervision towards independence, and its current task is to ensure that the trust territories are managed in accordance with the best interests of their residents. The General Assembly has elected Mexico and Iraq as council members, joining China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand as ex officio council members, forming a total of ten seats. If other territories subsequently join the trusteeship, the number of council seats will also change accordingly. For example, once the former Japanese mandated territories of the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands join the trusteeship, the United States will become an administering power, and a non-administering member state will need to be elected. President Truman recently announced that the former Japanese mandated territories will soon be proposed as "strategic area" trust territories. The territories currently under the jurisdiction of the Trusteeship Council are British Togoland, Cameroon, Tanganyika, French Togoland, Cameroon, Western Samoa under New Zealand's trusteeship, New Guinea under Australia's trusteeship, and Ruanda-Urundi under Belgium's trusteeship. The South African Union's request to annex the mandated territory of Southwest Africa has been rejected by the General Assembly, which has ordered that the territory be placed under United Nations trusteeship.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Conference on Non-Self-Governing Areas Convened - Philippine Amendment Passed <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed by a large majority the Philippine proposal regarding the convening of regional conferences on non-self-governing territories and peoples, as well as the Cuban amendment to that proposal. When the General Assembly debated the Philippine proposal, both the United Kingdom and the United States strongly opposed it. Later, a compromise proposal was put forward by the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, followed by another amendment from the Cuban representative, which resolved the dispute. When the Philippine amendment was finally put to a vote, there were 31 votes in favor, one vote against, and 20 abstentions. The resolution passed stated: "The United Nations General Assembly recommends that member states of the United Nations administering non-self-governing territories convene conferences, with representatives selected or elected from the populations of the non-self-governing territories, so as to give these populations an opportunity to express their wishes and views, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter." Before the vote, there was a lengthy debate, with US representative Dulles and UK representative Eavor calling for the rejection of the resolution, arguing that in its current form, it was inconsistent with the spirit of the Charter. French representative Parodi also vehemently opposed it, claiming that the resolution would shake the foundations of the Charter and would result in chaos, suspicion, and distrust among nations. At this point, Chinese representative Gu Weijun spoke from a conciliatory position, stating that in his opinion, both sides had presented sincere arguments, but the issue at hand was too important, and millions of people were awaiting a response, so it could not be ignored. He proposed that the Philippine resolution be amended to "the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations should invite the administering powers of non-self-governing territories to convene conferences of the populations of these territories." Philippine representative Romulo immediately thanked Gu. The US representative also stated that he was willing to express his support in the spirit of coordination, but the French representative remained opposed. After considerable discussion, the Cuban representative put forward a new amendment, arguing that member states should directly convene regional conferences of non-self-governing peoples if they deemed the situation permissible. This amendment ultimately passed with a two-thirds majority.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Restrictions on the Use of Veto Power <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Small Nations' Struggle Ends in Failure</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] The struggle of small nations to deprive the five major powers of their veto power in the Security Council, after years of effort, has ended in failure today, and they have had to concede. This most contentious issue in the United Nations organization has temporarily come to an end. The only achievement of the small nations' arduous struggle is a motion urging the five powers, China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, to use the veto power as little as possible, but they failed to have it revoked. However, according to various indications, the small nations will continue to fight later until the five major powers agree among themselves that they no longer need to use this privilege. The Soviet Union has exercised the veto power as many as nine times, so it bore the brunt of the discussion, but it remained steadfastly opposed and voted against the motion. Of the five major powers, only the Soviet Union alone held opposition, while the Slavic bloc supported it.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Freedom of the Press Conference - Decision to Convene Next Year <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] The General Assembly today decided that the United Nations Economic and Social Council will convene an international conference on freedom of the press next year to stipulate the responsibilities, rights, and methods of exercising freedom of the press. The representatives participating in this conference must be individuals who have close ties to the press, broadcasting, and film industries, or who have experience in the aforementioned fields. The resolution passed by the General Assembly emphasizes the necessity of achieving and maintaining freedom of the the press, so as to promote sincere international cooperation. The first part of the resolution stated: "Freedom of the press is one of the fundamental rights of mankind. Political freedom of the press is a necessary factor in the pursuit of world peace and progress. The principle of freedom of the press should stipulate that those who enjoy this right should not deliberately abuse it. The moral responsibility of searching for facts without prejudice and publishing them without malice is a major factor of freedom of the press. Furthermore, international understanding and cooperation are impossible without a sound and always attentive world public opinion, and to achieve this, complete freedom of the press is required."</p>

<p>Future Relief Plans Agreed Upon</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The UNRRA Council of 48 nations, holding its sixth meeting, reached an agreement on the major differences regarding the future relief organization plan with the Soviet Union, and adjourned today. The Council passed a compromise plan, recognizing that the Central Committee may make changes to the uncompleted US$600 million plan. It is apparent that the establishment of this motion represents a partial victory for the United States, whose government believes that a flexible plan should be established to allow for the supply of necessary goods to Austria, Greece, and Italy, as these countries are indeed in dire need of relief. Today's resolution also agreed that UNRRA should strive to complete its procurement of relief supplies in Europe and its relief work no later than March 31 next year, and in the Far East no later than June 30 next year. This resolution has also extended the original completion date by 90 days. If UNRRA fails to complete its procurement or transportation of relief supplies by the above-mentioned date, UNRRA has the right to arrange for the contract to be handled or continued by the relief recipient countries themselves. As the US Congress stipulated when appropriating funds to UNRRA that the organization should end its operations in Europe by March 31 next year and in the Far East by June 30, the motion did not stipulate any period beyond this. The United States should provide UNRRA with funds. The Council also decided today to convene the seventh Council meeting, which would also be the final meeting, before June 30 next year, unless the Central Committee unanimously believes that the meeting is unnecessary, in which case it will be canceled. The Council also approved the 1947 UNRRA budget of US$9.5 million, with the United States bearing the largest share, 40%, and China bearing 5%. The Council instructed the Central Committee to report on plans to encourage the return of displaced persons and agreed to encourage the automatic establishment of various organizations to cooperate with UNRRA and provide them with assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Distribution of Japanese Reparations - Implementation Possible Early Next Year <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Union Remains Silent</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, United Press] Although the Soviet Union remains silent on the issue of Japanese reparations, the US government still hopes to obtain the agreement of the Allied nations to the US plan, so that the distribution of Japanese reparations can begin early next year. Some official personnel said today that they doubt whether Pauley's report, which criticized the Soviet army for being responsible for US$2 billion in factory losses in the Northeast, can influence the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japanese reparations or the support of other Allied nations. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union replies, the US government should be able to implement the US plan after January 1 next year, at which time it will first distribute 15% to 20% of the reparations. Well-informed sources pointed out that the criticisms in the Pauley report have already been concretely expressed. Pauley's criticism is no more intense than the US government's note to Moscow in February protesting the Soviet army's removal of factories from the Northeast.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur today released the Korean occupation report for September, stating that labor strikes have occurred repeatedly in January, there is no sign of industrial recovery, and there was an assassination attempt on Korean independence movement leader Syngman Rhee. Three newspapers were temporarily suspended. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, delivered a speech, issuing a warning that the strike of 30,000 railway workers on September 22, which disrupted transportation in southern Korea, had a political background and was intended to hinder the US forces in Korea. The striking workers did not make demands in advance, nor did they attempt to mediate, and their intention was obvious. The amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Korea has increased from 1.285 billion to over 11.3 billion. Although policing has improved, the number of crimes in August increased in all but one province. Hoarding remains rampant, preventing the rice collection plan from being completed soon. Part of industrial production is affected due to a lack of balanced development, and the wages earned by workers are insufficient to maintain their lives.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hollywood, 14th] Cartoon characters Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Andy Panda seem to be becoming less active on the screen, and there may be a day when they become extinct. The prospects for cartoon film production in Hollywood are bleak. Columbia Pictures has abandoned its film, and other companies are also preparing to announce their abandonment. Len Schlosser, chairman of the Screen Cartoonists Guild, said: The opportunity to watch cartoons will decrease in 1947, and 1948 is even more unthinkable and pessimistic. The reason is that since 1941, the cost of making cartoons has increased by 165%, while the rental fee for showing cartoons has only increased by 12%. Although movie theaters are more crowded than ever, the rental price of cartoons remains unchanged at US$2.50 to US$4 per day. In addition, it is difficult to print color cartoons, and black and white cartoons are not popular with audiences. Therefore, the golden age of cartoons will gradually disappear.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Large Increase in Taxes a Heavy Burden on the General Public; City Council Budget Committee Discussed Yesterday; Believes City Finances Are Close to Balanced, Should Not Double Tax Collection <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Budget Committee of the City Council held its third meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. at the Council, attended by eight councilors including He Yuanming, Xu Yongzuo, and Li Wenjie. Deputy Speaker Xu Ji, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, and City Government Accounting Director Xiang Fan were also present. He Yuanming chaired the meeting. The committee discussed the matter of autumn and winter property taxes and municipal construction taxes being too heavy a burden on the people, and the necessity of reconsidering this. This proposal was originally made by Li Wenjie and seconded by Zhu Fuqiu, Yan Yilin, Qu Yue, and He Yuanming. A temporary motion stated: This council approved the city government's supplementary levy of municipal construction tax on property tax during the autumn and winter seasons of this year to offset part of the 22,149,432,241 yuan shortfall in the city's budget for the second half of this year, so that the city's construction expenditures would not be completely unsupported. This was originally a temporary emergency measure. According to the original estimate by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the autumn increase was 2 billion yuan per month, totaling 6 billion yuan, and the winter increase was doubled to 12 billion yuan, totaling 18 billion yuan. In the revised budget submitted by the city government to this council, under the item of land improvement tax revenue in the regular revenue category of ordinary income, property tax is listed as 900 million yuan, and property tax attached to municipal construction tax is listed as 18.8079912241 billion yuan in the temporary revenue category of ordinary income, which is based on the above estimated figures. The Municipal Finance Bureau has already begun collecting the autumn municipal construction tax. Citizens who have received payment notices all feel that the amount is enormous, and some even say that the tax is too heavy and unbearable. Normally, for Grade C houses with an annual rental value of less than 1,000 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic, the autumn tax is almost three times higher than the summer tax (using my own house as an example, the estimated rental value is 588 yuan, and the autumn tax is 29,400 yuan, of which only about 20% of the actual rent is property tax borne by the landlord). The summer tax was only 11,112 yuan (shared equally with the landlord), the spring tax was only 2,470 yuan, and the winter tax last year was only 1,233 yuan. In one year, the tax amount has increased nearly 24 times. Although the amount is not too large, for Grade A (annual rent of 1,800 yuan or more in the 26th year of the Republic) and Grade B (annual rent of 1,000 yuan or more but less than 1,800 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic) houses, the tax amount is often tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, which is indeed the heaviest burden imposed on the citizens of the city since the establishment of the City Council in order to balance the city budget. This council's resolution on the Municipal Finance Bureau's policy report originally stated that "if the tax revenue in the second half of this year can exceed the original estimate by one-half, the city government's shortfall can be easily resolved without increasing taxes and burdens on the people." The land value tax and business tax levied in the second half of this year will certainly be higher than the amount listed in the original budget. It is estimated that the increase in revenue in the autumn will not be less than 6 billion yuan. The Municipal Finance Bureau should clearly state the total amount to be collected. If it has reached half of the 18 billion yuan budgeted, the winter tax should not be doubled. If the total amount to be collected exceeds half of the 18 billion yuan budgeted, the winter tax rate should not only not be doubled, but should also be verified and reduced to take into account the taxpayers' ability to pay under the current economic downturn, while supporting the city government's budget. Furthermore, the current year is coming to an end, and the Municipal Finance Bureau must be clear about the actual revenue and expenditure of the city's finances, and the exact amount of the shortfall. If the overall revenue and expenditure shortfall is not too large, there is no reason to double the winter municipal construction tax. It was resolved to transfer this case to the Finance Committee, and to hold a joint meeting with the Finance Committee today, inviting Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan to attend and report in detail on the amount of all tax revenue to be received in the second half of this year, and how it compares to the budget. If the revenue and expenditure can be balanced, the winter property tax and municipal tax will not be doubled, and other matters will be resolved.</p>

<p>As for other cases: (1) Approved the City Government's letter submitting the revised budget for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect three councilors, Li Wenjie, He Yuanming, and Yan Yilin, to review and submit a resolution for public decision. The review opinions were passed, and Councilor Xu Yongzuo supplemented that both expenditures and revenues must be studied in detail and the reasons thoroughly investigated before they can be passed. (2) The General Assembly referred the City Government's letter submitting the final account for the previous year. It was discussed at the second meeting and resolved to publicly elect three councilors, Xu Yongzuo, Qu Yue, and Wang Naixu, to review and submit a resolution for public decision. Councilor Xu Yongzuo reported on the meeting with Accounting Director Min, stating that the review of the final account should be based on the budget, but the budget was compiled later, and the final account almost conforms to it. At the same time, the budget was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after it was compiled, but there has been no reply to date. The current focus of research is whether the revenue and expenditure of the final account are legal and whether the procedures are appropriate. The relevant vouchers have been sent by the City Government to the Audit Office for handling, and there are no further comments. Therefore, this case cannot be discussed and can only be analyzed and observed based on the report. (3) Approved the transfer of the project to build the 21-meter northern section of Tianmu Road within the budget scope by the Public Works Committee. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect Councilor Zhu Wenqi to send someone to the Secretariat to conduct an on-site inspection before requesting review and approval. After Secretary-General Xiang reported on the investigation, it was decided to send the resolution of the Public Works Committee to the Public Works Bureau for revision and submission to the committee for review. (4) Approved the transfer of the budget plan and drawings for the construction of Huashan Road for reconsideration by the Public Works Committee. It was resolved at the second meeting to publicly elect Councilor Zhu Wenqi to send someone to the Secretariat to conduct an on-site inspection before requesting review and approval. (5) Approved the City Government's letter to transfer the funds for Zhongshan South Road to build the Huashan Road widening project for review. The above two cases were discussed together. Secretary-General Xiang reported on the investigation, stating that Huashan Road is the corner of Haig Road, Shanzhong Road, and Dianjun Road. The houses protrude into the road, which is very inconvenient for traffic. If they need to be demolished, 16 houses will be partially demolished, of which only two are two-story buildings, and the rest are bungalows. The total cost, including compensation, is 100 million yuan. The committee resolved to approve it. In addition, the Secretariat of the Council transferred the resolution of the fifth meeting of the Education Committee, requesting discussion on three points regarding the adjustment of salaries of principals of national schools as a reference for budget preparation. It was resolved that the budget for this year has already been finalized by the City Government and it is not appropriate to add to it. It will be submitted for reference when reviewing the budget for the 36th year of the Republic.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Collection of Land Value Tax; Zhu Ping Discusses the Process <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Collect 3 Billion Yuan This Year</p>
<p>Zhu Ping, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, hosted editors of various newspapers in the city at the New Life Club last night to report on the process of collecting land value tax in the city. He stated that the city's collection of land value tax was ordered by the Executive Yuan and urged by the City Council. Preparations were made in haste, and collection began on the 16th of last month. After the collection began, the people actively paid taxes. 1.8 billion yuan has already been collected, accounting for 60% of the amount to be collected. It is expected that 3 billion yuan will be collected this year. The city government has promulgated the "Shanghai Municipal Land Value Tax Late Payment Penalty Measures." Those who fail to pay taxes by the deadline will be fined and charged a late payment fee. The bureau has sent staff to distribute notices and urge payment, but is not responsible for collecting tax payments. All tax payments are collected by staff from the Treasury Department stationed at various tax calculation offices. Citizens are requested to pay attention. If owners have not received a notice due to a change of address, they are requested to go to various tax calculation offices to calculate and pay taxes to avoid fines. Those whose land has been occupied should still pay land value tax because land value tax is collected based on ownership. Those whose land has been occupied can clear the occupants according to the law. Those whose land has been occupied by private individuals can sue in court. Those whose land has been occupied by government agencies can request the occupying agency to return the land, provide compensation, collect taxes, or provide rent. They are also requested to report to the bureau so that it can assist in transferring the request for clearance. Foreigners who own land in Shanghai should also pay land tax. Regarding the issue of land valuation, Zhu said that the bureau followed legal procedures and was evaluated by the Land Valuation Appraisal Committee. Regarding the registration of foreign land, the registration procedures have been negotiated with the consulates of countries that have signed equal and reciprocal treaties with us. Foreigners from other countries without treaties and stateless foreigners who own land in the city must register before the end of the year. Otherwise, all land will be regarded as ownerless land. The bureau has cleared public land. To avoid omissions, the "Measures to Encourage Reporting Concealed Public Land" has been formulated. Anyone who secretly reports and is verified will be given a bonus of 20% of the value of the land found. Land that was originally private land but has become ownerless land due to the disappearance of the owner should be owned by the public. Those who report the occupation will also be subject to the above measures.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] An airplane collision occurred at Longhua Airport in the city at about 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. A China National Aviation Corporation plane, fully loaded with passengers from Beijing to Shanghai, was almost completely destroyed due to a careless landing. The plane was a C-47 type 67 passenger plane on the Beijing-Shanghai route, and the pilot was American Captain Napki. When it arrived at Longhua Airport, dusk had already fallen and it was drizzling. Napki piloted the plane from south to north, landing on the runway with a northeast wind. However, due to landing too quickly and without reducing speed, the plane bounced up and then descended again, sliding forward. At this moment, the plane's direction changed and it turned to the left side of the runway. This area was originally a public parking area with five China Airlines planes parked in a row. The China National Aviation Corporation plane that ran off the runway immediately crashed into the first China Airlines plane No. 104 on the right, its left wing shearing off the tail rudder of the China Airlines plane. The left engine and propeller also cut into the right wing of the China Airlines plane, and the right engine destroyed part of the right wing of the China Airlines plane. At this time, the right engine of the China National Aviation Corporation plane immediately caught fire. At the same time, due to the obstruction of the China Airlines plane, it stopped moving forward. This can be said to be a blessing in disguise, because if it had continued forward for another 50 yards, it would have collided with a hangar full of gasoline, which would have resulted in a fire, destroying both the plane and the people, which would have been unimaginable. After the China National Aviation Corporation plane had an accident, the flames from the right engine were extinguished. Except for one passenger who was injured, the rest were unharmed. After being ordered by the government to cease flying, China Airlines has already transferred the aforementioned five planes to Xin Sui Company (a company that has been operating transportation services in Xinjiang and Suiyuan). Yesterday, the person in charge of Xin Sui Company told reporters that plane No. 104 was damaged for no reason and will file a protest with China National Aviation Corporation today, and reserves the right to demand compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Whereabouts of Missing Passenger Plane Unknown; Central Air Transport Corporation Dispatched Two Planes Yesterday; Searching the Suzhou-Wuxi Area <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Central Air Transport Corporation Flight No. 31 has been missing since it disappeared on its way from Beijing to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The company's flight crew sent planes to search the Suzhou-Wuxi area all day yesterday, but found nothing. When the company's planes flying to Ping, Kun, and Yu took off yesterday morning, they were instructed to search along the Beijing-Shanghai line, but found nothing. In the afternoon, two special planes were dispatched to search. The first plane was No. 47, piloted by pilot Hong Qiming, accompanied by co-pilot Liao Yuehan and radioman Wang Feng, and took off at 12:05 p.m. The second plane was No. 39, personally piloted by Chief Pilot Chen Wenhui, accompanied by co-pilot Mao Xinguan and radioman Jiang Yuchun, and took off at 1:45 p.m. This reporter boarded special plane No. 39 to search for the missing passenger plane. At that time, the weather had cleared up, and weak sunlight shone through the clouds. The wind direction was the same as the day before: wide northeast wind. Visibility was also good, reaching more than five jia.</p>
<p>After taking off, Flight No. 39 flew 20 degrees west, intending to explore the mountains south of Suzhou. The reporter looked down from an altitude of 1,500 feet, and saw fields, rivers, and thatched houses clearly. After Qingpu, there were many lakes. Crossing Dianshan Lake, Cheng Lake, and Jiuli Lake. At about 2 p.m., crossing Baodai Bridge south of Suzhou, the special plane turned southwest and soon approached the Dongshan Mountain in Dongting. The crew members were very nervous. When the special plane circled this small hill, they all strained their eyes to search the foothills, hillsides, and ridges, but saw only yellow soil and white stones, peaceful as ever, with no anomalies. After circling twice for ten minutes, it turned to other places. All the mountains near Dongting West Mountain, Yangshan Mountain, as well as Guangfu, Shanren Bridge, and Mudu Town, such as Qionglong Mountain, Qizi Mountain, and Lingyan Mountain, were thoroughly explored, and even half of Taihu Lake on the east coast was searched, taking one and a half hours, but nothing was found. It then returned to base. At 3:45 p.m., it returned to Longhua Airport and landed, flying for exactly two hours. Another special plane, No. 47, also flew back to the airport at 2:15 p.m. and searched the Huishan area of Wuxi, but found nothing. It is reported that the missing passenger plane was Flight No. 31, the Beijing-Shanghai flight, which was carrying passengers and transporting banknotes to Shanghai on the 13th (Friday). It usually stayed overnight in Beijing and flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 14th. Thirty minutes after takeoff, it communicated by radio with another passenger plane en route, inquiring about a leather bag left in Beijing. Forty-five minutes later, the aviation stations in Beijing and Shanghai no longer received its radio signals and could not get a response, so it was reported missing. The captain of the plane was Ma Faxiang, and the co-pilot was Zhang Shudong, both of whom were experienced pilots. According to aviation experts, the reason may have been the bad weather on the 14th. The pilots may have lowered their altitude due to low clouds and heavy rain, causing them to hit a mountain somewhere. Therefore, the two special planes that set out to search yesterday targeted the mountains in the Suzhou-Wuxi area. The company has not given up hope that the missing passenger plane may have been forced to land, and is still making every effort to find it, hoping that the plane and the people can return safely.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] A customer suddenly came to Jinlong Watch Shop at No. 78 Zhengzhong North Road at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. He was wearing a brand-new suit and looked like a fine young gentleman. He wanted to buy a watch. The clerk, Lu Junyao, took out three watches for him to choose from. Unexpectedly, in an instant, one watch disappeared without a trace. After searching everywhere without success, the police were called to the scene and the customer was detained. Four Lion brand 606 needles were found on his body, but nothing else. He gave his name as Yang Zhiming, 34 years old, from Guangdong. At this time, his attitude gradually strengthened, and he demanded compensation for reputational damage. Then, a policeman slapped him on the mouth, and he spat out a small luminous watch. Thus, both the person and the stolen goods were seized. He was temporarily detained and will be sent to the judicial authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Founded in the Sixth Year of Tongzhi, with a Long History; Jiangnan Shipyard Actively Reviving; Modern Equipment and Careful Management; Managing with Difficulty to Become China's Largest Shipyard <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Feature] In this industrially backward China, all heavy industrial equipment must rely on foreign countries. Although the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy cannot currently build something like the "Queen Elizabeth" ship, it can not only build ships for China itself, but also build ships for foreign countries. This can indeed make us raise our eyebrows and exhale! Everyone knows that the President ships of the American Dollar Steamship Company are world-renowned and occupy a very high position in the history of China's shipping industry. However, few people know that the four 10,000-ton freighters that they newly added in the ninth year of the Republic were built by our Jiangnan Shipyard for them.</p>
<p>Building Ships for the United States for the First Time During World War I</p>
<p>Jiangnan Shipyard was founded in the sixth year of Tongzhi. At that time, it was still operating at Ti Diao Bridge. Later, the Manufacturing Bureau allocated part of the Gaochang Temple site as a shipyard. In the early years of the Republic, it was renamed Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy. At that time, the equipment was very simple. In 1914, World War I broke out, and the United States allocated funds to build four 10,000-ton ships. By 1920, they were built and handed over to the Dollar Steamship Company. Later, the surplus was used to expand the shipyard, and then six gunboats were built for the US Navy. Ma Deji, the director of the shipyard, took charge of the shipyard in the sixteenth year of the Republic, left the shipyard in the nineteenth year, and returned to the shipyard in the twenty-second year. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the autumn of the thirty-third year of the Republic, he and more than 20 other engineers went to the United States to serve at the US naval shipyard, studied for more than a year, returned to China, and rejoined the shipyard. His biggest goal was to expand the Jiangnan Shipyard and make it a modern shipyard. After Ma Deji negotiated in the United States in various ways, the United States and China reached an agreement to supply the shipyard with equipment and materials worth a total of US$10 million. One-third of this batch of materials has been shipped, and the rest are being shipped to China one after another. In six months, the equipment can be ready. As for the repayment method, it will be paid off in 30 years, with one-thirtieth of the amount repaid each year, but not in cash, but in shipbuilding labor.</p>
<p>Three Shipyards and 5,000 Employees</p>
<p>The shipyard was occupied by the enemy during the fall of Shanghai, almost completely destroyed, and the arsenal was destroyed to expand the site. Therefore, when the shipyard was taken over, it had a total of 500 acres of land, which was more than twice as much as before the war. However, the machinery and factory buildings had only losses and no additions. Currently, due to limited funds, it can only be gradually restored, but reporters who visited the various office locations have already felt the grandeur and orderliness of the scale.</p>
<p>The internal organization is divided into: (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Design Department, (3) Production Department, (4) Personnel Office. In terms of equipment, there are three shipyards: one 500 feet long and 78 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 10,000 tons; one 575 feet long and 78 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 15,000 to 20,000 tons; and one 62 feet long and 100 feet wide, which can accommodate ships weighing 30,000 tons. Other facilities, such as electrical plants, refrigeration plants, welding plants, engine plants, and foundries, are all complete and will be expanded. The accounting department inside the shipyard is particularly modernized, with international business machines, which is one of only two in China, which can save two-thirds of the manpower. The total number of employees in the shipyard is more than 5,500, including 379 technical personnel, 4,882 workers, and soldiers, etc. There are seven American engineers, two British engineers, and one Japanese engineer who is an electrical engineer, who will resign at the end of this year. There are also more than 20 female employees who are responsible for clerical work.</p>
<p>Strong Productivity and Emphasis on Welfare</p>
<p>The shipyard's production capacity is quite strong. It can build three 10,000-ton ships in one year, and can also build other small ships at the same time. It can build more than ten ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons for coastal use in one year, and also build ships for inland rivers. It can build 30 ships of 100 to 1,000 tons for inland river travel every year, and also build tugboats, barges, and steel structures. In the past year, it has repaired and built 582 ships of various sizes, including foreign naval and commercial ships. Currently, 73 ships are being repaired and 41 ships are being built.</p>
<p>The management and welfare of employees are very well organized. Director Ma hopes that employees will regard the factory as their home, establish close relationships, and stabilize their lives. There is a reading room, an economical Chinese and Western canteen, a barber shop, a bathroom, a laundry, and a sewing room inside the shipyard. However, the dormitory is quite a problem. The existing dormitory can only accommodate more than 100 people. A large dormitory will be built in one or two weeks to accommodate more than 2,000 workers. The internal equipment is also as complete as possible. In order to subsidize the lives of employees, the shipyard has a consumer cooperative, and marriage, funeral, childbirth, and education subsidies. The wages of workers are based on the cost of living index, and the base salary is based on the 26th year of the Republic, with the lowest daily wage estimated at 6,000 yuan and the highest at 18,000 yuan. Workers work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Registration is done according to the new American factory system, and salaries are paid by a special office set up by the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Visiting the Vast Ship Repair Project</p>
<p>In addition, apprentices are given technical training after work. The qualification is four years of training after graduating from elementary school. After graduation, they become fifth-grade craftsmen. Apprentices are provided with food, clothing, and accommodation and are also given a stipend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporters were hosted by Director Ma and led by several engineers, including Shan Yunxiang and Huang Lv, to visit and explained in detail. Ships are being repaired in the shipyard, and the project is very vast. It is reported that the cost of repairing ships and the docking fee are calculated according to tonnage, at 800 yuan per ton. The first day of docking is charged in full, and the subsequent days are charged at half the price. Other repair costs, machine assembly, etc. are charged separately. The reporters walked a lot and visited a lot of factory buildings. It is said that it is only a part of it. According to the shipyard staff, it takes at least three hours to visit and inspect all of them.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Shipyard is the largest shipyard in China. As the country is starting to build after the War of Resistance Against Japan, how much should we value such a national treasure! We expect to see it expand step by step and bring glory to our country's industry!</p>

<p>Giant Ship Under Repair (Photo by Our Reporter)</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was Sunday. The Great Light Cinema added an early morning showing at 8:30 AM to entertain the National Army. The film shown was "Sharpshooter." About twenty minutes after the start, inside the main hall, approximately three to four hundred soldiers from the First Company of the Third Battalion of the Central China Railway of the Northeast Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, stationed at 381 Sun Temple Road in Zhabei, and thirty to forty Youth Army soldiers quarreled over seating. The theater was immediately in turmoil, with loud voices and disrupted order. The lights were then turned back on. At this time, the White Crane Road Military Police Team, stationed at the cinema to maintain order, led by Squad Leader Xie Chunting, fearing an incident, had Squad Leader Xie step forward alone to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, the traffic police not only ignored the劝阻, but with a shout, used their leather belts as weapons to brutally beat him, causing serious injuries. He was carried to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the cinema, seeing the seriousness of the situation, immediately reported to the White Crane Road Military Police Team. Company Commander Deng then dispatched Platoon Leader Liu Weihong to lead the entire military police force to quell the disturbance and secretly sent military police to identify the traffic police who committed the assault, marking a cross on their clothing with chalk. When the play ended and the audience exited, the military police had reinforced the team and waited at the door, prepared to arrest the traffic police with white crosses on their clothing. They detained seven people, including Zhou Ping. It is reported that Squad Leader Xie suffered injuries to his abdomen and face. Afterwards, a senior traffic police officer came forward to mediate, expressing deep regret for the unjustified assault on Squad Leader Xie by the illegal police officers and intending to publish an apology in the newspaper. They also agreed to bear all medical expenses. The police conflict came to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Wartime Confiscated Vessels: Mostly Discovered in Japan, Zhou Maobai Reports on Investigation and Negotiations, Expected to be Returned After Sufficient Evidence is Presented <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The number of ships seized and sunk by Japanese invaders during the war was extremely large. In order to negotiate compensation with Japan, President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, specially dispatched Zhou Maobai, Director of the Central Shipbuilding Plant of the Resources Committee, to Japan to investigate and negotiate the issue of ship compensation. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau recently received Zhou's investigation report from the Chinese Mission in Japan, stating: "For all of our country's ships that were seized or sunk by Japan during the war, efforts should be made to search for detailed manuals, nationality certificates, and related documents for forced acquisition or requisition of each vessel. These should be completed as soon as possible before the end of this month and attempts should be made to keep them in Japan in order to negotiate their return. Difficulties in negotiation will arise if the deadline is exceeded." Zhou also presented the recent investigation and negotiation situation to President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, the contents of which are:</p>
<p>A. The ships whose whereabouts are known and are under negotiation are: (1) The "Continent" (大陸號), investigated by the Japanese government? It was reported that the ship went missing near South Korea on February 20, 1945, and may have sunk. The headquarters of General MacArthur has been notified and asked to verify the location of the sinking to prepare for possible salvage. (2) The "Flying Star" (飛星號), seized by the Japanese, is currently being used as a ferry in Japan. MacArthur has been requested to return it.

If the owner can provide sufficient evidence, it can be returned. (8) The "Yuan" (源號) is currently secretly docked near Osaka, lacking various documents and photographs. MacArthur's headquarters has been requested to return it. (9) The "Hainan" (海南號) has been personally investigated by Zhou Maobai, and its whereabouts are known, but the machinery has been damaged. The local Mitsubishi and Kawaminami shipyards in Japan have been commissioned to assess the price in preparation for repairs.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yesterday at 2:30 PM, three cars collided at the intersection of East Zhongzheng Road and West Tibet Road. A green car with license plate number 1172 from Shanghai stopped while going west to east due to encountering a red light. A small military jeep car under trial of the Army Armored Forces Education and Training General Team with number 2, and a cargo truck with number 35065 followed behind. Because the two vehicles were traveling too fast and did not have time to brake, the truck crashed into the rear of the jeep car, and the jeep car crashed into the rear of the green car, causing considerable damage to the rear of the green car. The damage to the rear two vehicles was lighter. There were no deaths or injuries. The police took the three cars and the drivers to the New City Branch for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Great American Shipping Company Establishes Branch in Shanghai <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The American Great American Shipping Company (United States Line), headquartered in New York, operates vessels on the Atlantic route. It has more than sixty vessels of over 10,000 tons, and large passenger ships exceeding 30,000 tons, having a long history in the American Atlantic shipping industry. After this victory? Some of the vessels carried relief supplies to China, managed by the American President Lines in this city. Recently, the company believes that the Far East route should be developed, so it established a branch in Shanghai and purchased more than forty new vessels dedicated to the Pacific China-America route. It is scheduled to be established on January 1 next year, with offices located on the second floor of No. 17 Zhongshan East Road (Bund). Tong Xinyuan has been hired as the Chinese Manager, and Qiu Guosheng as the Chief Accountant. Mr. Tong has considerable experience in shipping affairs, having served in the American President Lines (formerly the Great American Shipping Company) for more than twenty years and has always been valued by the company's management. This time, upon transferring, the President Lines repeatedly tried to retain him, but Mr. Tong had already accepted the offer from the Great American Company and had to resign from his original position. The night before last, his colleagues and friends from import and export companies, transportation and customs clearance industries celebrated Mr. Tong's promotion at the Jingmian Restaurant. More than 150 people attended. Senior Western staff members from the Great American Company, Mr. Ring, Mr. Carey, and Mr. Stedam also attended.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Compensation for Wartime Casualties in this City Will be Increased by 1,250 Times the Original Amount, Personnel Office of the Municipal Government Drafts Plan for Implementation After Approval <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan, which stated: "The compensation standards set in the 'Implementation Measures for Compensation for Casualties Among People Defending the Territory' have only been increased once since the promulgation of these measures in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), issued at five times the original amount. Considering current prices, this is truly a drop in the bucket, and it is necessary to revise it significantly. The Henan Provincial Government has requested an increase in the above standard to the Yuan, which was referred to the Ministries of Interior and Finance for review and was submitted to the 762nd meeting of this Yuan in October this year for decision: The compensation standards can be handled at the discretion of each provincial government. As for the funding for this compensation, now that the fiscal revenue and expenditure system has been reformed, it should be coordinated by the provincial budget, in addition to reporting to the Supreme National Defense Council for record and distribution, it is hereby ordered to comply." After receiving the above instructions, the Personnel Office of the Municipal Government considered the actual price situation in the city and used the current price of rice as the standard, increasing the original standard by 1,250 times.</p>
<p>Increased Once in the 32nd Year</p>
<p>The Implementation Measures for Compensation for Casualties Among People Defending the Territory were promulgated in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). They stipulated that people injured or killed while defending the territory could receive a one-time compensation of 80 yuan and an annual pension of 50 yuan. Those with first-class injuries (such as those who are blind in both eyes) could receive a one-time compensation of 70 yuan and an annual pension of 40 yuan. Those with second-class injuries (such as those with a disabled hand or foot) could receive a one-time compensation of 60 yuan and an annual pension of 35 yuan. Those with third-class injuries (such as those who are deaf in one ear or have a missing nose) could receive a one-time compensation of 40 yuan and an annual pension of 30 yuan. The above compensation standards were increased once in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), issued at five times the original amount. At that time, the highest compensation was 400 yuan of national currency and an annual pension of 250 yuan. If converted at the price of rice at that time, the one-time compensation could be used to buy about 2 shi of rice, and the annual pension could be used to buy 1 shi and 2 dou and 5 sheng of rice.</p>
<p>Adjusting Standards with Reference to Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since then, prices have risen repeatedly. Considering the current situation, the price of rice is about 250 times higher than that in the 32nd year of the Republic (the current price of rice is 50,000 yuan per dan), which is equivalent to 1,250 times that of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Therefore, it is proposed to adjust the city's compensation standards with reference to the current price of rice, increasing the original amount specified in the implementation measures by 1,250 times. For example, those injured or killed while defending villages and towns, whose original one-time compensation was 80 yuan, will receive a one-time compensation of 100,000 yuan after being increased by 1,250 times (still equivalent to 2 shi of rice). The original annual pension was 50 yuan, and after the increase, it will be 62,500 yuan (still equivalent to 1 shi and 2 dou and 5 sheng of rice).</p>
<p>The proposed adjustment method has been drafted by the Personnel Office of the Municipal Government and will be implemented after being approved by this Municipal Government meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Pawnshop Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Although Shanghai is a financial hub with more banks and money shops than anywhere else, they are mostly inaccessible to ordinary people. Only pawnshops provide a place for them to exchange goods for cash. The saying that "pawnshops are the maternal uncles of the poor" is very accurate.</p>
<p>Shanghai is also a paradise for adventurers and a breeding ground for speculative crimes. The rise and fall of families and the success or failure of individual careers can change in an instant. Therefore, the pawnshop industry has emerged in response to these conditions. In recent years, the cost of living has risen, and small citizens and salaried workers cannot make ends meet. Do they want to borrow from relatives and friends? In today's world of coldheartedness and indifference, who will open their wallets to help? Only the clothes on their backs can be pawned to exchange for some money. Although the term is short and the interest is high, it is a stopgap measure that quenches thirst with poison. However, under the pressure of livelihood, where else can they find a better method?</p>
<p>Therefore, this old-fashioned rural financial institution—the pawnshop—is found on every street in Shanghai, as common as fortune telling paper shops. However, truly worthy of the name "pawnshop" are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Most engage in high-interest exploitation, sucking the blood of the poor. According to past regulations, pawnshops had to obtain a license from the ministry before they could operate. Even now, they must first register with the competent authority and cannot operate until they obtain a registration certificate. The length of the term and the level of interest are also strictly restricted. Therefore, opening a pawnshop requires a huge amount of capital.</p>
<p>The Symbol of a Pawnshop</p>
<p>Pawnshops are inherently rather lofty and majestic. With sturdy walls, they seem profound and mysterious. If it weren't for that huge character "當" (pawn) , people would mistake them for government offices. Inside the gate, there is also a wooden screen to separate the interior from the exterior. Because pawning something is an unseemly matter, the screen conceals the interior, preventing outsiders from seeing inside at a glance. However, pawnshops in Shanghai are now scattered everywhere, but they are pitifully small, mostly only one room. Due to competition among the shops, neon lights are installed at the entrance, emitting dazzling light in the evening and late at night, as if waving to people and giving customers a kind of irony. Some arrange display windows, showcasing many pieces of jewelry. These are all dead goods waiting to be sold. In the commercial center of Shanghai, pawnshops have reversed their past solemn attitude and have become completely commercialized.</p>
<p>The counters of pawnshops are often higher than those of other shops. Poor people standing under the high counter have to look up and still cannot clearly see the items on the counter. This high counter and the appraiser's face, with its towering arrogance, are enough to bully the pitiful poor. In front of the counter, iron railings are densely arranged, separating the trade through the railings. In a small pawnshop, the area in front of the counter is very small, often too small for customers to turn around.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Huizhou Gang and the Chaoshan Gang <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Pawnshops in Shanghai are mostly run by people from Huizhou. At that time, banks were still in their infancy, and people below the middle class did not have dealings with money shops. When they encountered economic difficulties, they would take their belongings to pawn to solve their immediate needs. Therefore, the poor regarded pawnshops as their only savior. It was expected that pawnshops would make a profit. Later, people from Chaoshan also successively opened pawnshops. However, considering that the terms of Huizhou pawnshops were too long and required a large amount of capital, they created small pawnshops, shortening the terms. The business of small pawnshops gradually expanded, creating another situation in the industry. Thus, for a time, the pawnshop industry in Shanghai was exclusively dominated by the Chaoshan and Huizhou gangs. Later, the local people also used their huge floating capital to participate in this industry, gaining momentum and eventually surpassing the others. The Chaoshan and Huizhou gangs, in turn, became outdated and retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Past History <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Pawnshops are places where wealth gathers, so they are easily coveted by thieves. In times of chaos, pawnshops are often the first to suffer. After the chaos subsides, amidst the devastation, pawnshops begin to regulate people's livelihoods again. Therefore, the rise and fall of the pawnshop industry are closely related to governance and disorder. During the Taiping Rebellion in the Qing Dynasty, pawnshops in Shanghai suffered heavy looting, and little remained. After the rebellion was settled, the local authorities established public pawnshops to help those who survived the disaster. Many private pawnshops were largely established according to the regulations of the public pawnshops. Small pawnshops were a special product of the concessions. After the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the market in Zhabei gradually prospered, and small pawnshops gradually appeared. Since the Republic of China, the county towns were demolished, and roads were rebuilt, and small pawnshops invaded Nanshi. During the peak period of the pawnshop industry, there were more than 80 large pawnshops and more than 500 small pawnshops in Shanghai. Later, the global economic panic attacked Shanghai, and many pawnshops also suffered the same fate, losing money year after year, and many went bankrupt one after another. Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there were less than 200 left.</p>
<p>The flames of the "August 13th" incident (Battle of Shanghai) caused everyone to flee to the former concessions to seek refuge. They were in dire straits and had to rely on pawning to survive. The pawnshop industry then prospered again, and new pawnshops were established in increasing numbers, reaching over 1,000 at most. After the victory, many have closed down, but there are still more than 900 registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the current interest rates are very high, coupled with heavy taxes, and even the high-interest pawnshops are struggling to maintain themselves. At the same time, the social purchasing power is weak, and the pawned items are not easily sold after the term expires. It seems that the pawnshop industry is gradually declining.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Black-Hearted Exploitation of Ordinary People <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In the past, formal pawnshops stipulated a term of 18 months, with a grace period of five days after the expiration date. The interest rate was 1.8 to 2% per month, plus 1% for "storage fees," which were distributed among the staff. Later, the Chaoshan gang operated pawnshops because they did not have a large amount of revolving funds, so they shortened the term to six months or eight months. In fact, since Shanghai opened its port, it has been trending towards prosperity and fashion. Clothes placed in pawnshops for a year and a half are already out of fashion, especially women's clothing, which changes constantly. Therefore, the outdated clothes after the term expires are not easy to sell. In the past, selling expired goods could still earn 30 to 40% interest, but later it became the opposite, losing 200 to 300 yuan for every 1,000 yuan. Therefore, large pawnshops gradually shortened the term to 12 months. Small pawnshops reduced it from six months to four months.</p>
<p>As for interest rates, in the past, except for large pawnshops that still followed the regulations, small pawnshops were roughly divided into three levels: 3% for loans above 3 yuan, 3% for loans above 2 yuan, and as high as 4.5% for loans below 1 yuan. The smaller the pawn loan, the higher the interest. Some even had a term of ten days, with an interest rate of 3% per term, reaching 9% per month.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation in the concessions was special, and many pawnshop operators did whatever they wanted, shortening the term to two months or one month, with interest rates as high as 50 to 60% per month. They also set up names such as storage rent and commission. Some even calculated compound interest every ten days, and some deducted interest in advance. In short, wherever there was profit, they exhausted all their exploitative abilities. The so-called regulation of people's livelihoods had long become a misnomer. Although restrictions were added after the victory, stipulating a term of two months, interest rates of 27% per month, storage rent of 4%, and handling fee of 15%, totaling 46% for the first month and 31% for the second month. With such high interest rates, the poor could no longer bear the burden. On the pawnshop side, with high interest rates, large expenses, and difficult business operations, how could they relieve the suffering of the people under the oppression of high prices?</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Appraiser's Expression <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>When walking into a pawnshop to pawn clothes, one must first observe the expression of the "appraiser" under the high counter. Once an item is sent to the high counter, its value depends on the appraiser's decision. Generally, it is valued at 60% of the original price. Once the price of the goods is determined, it is not easily changed. Even if customers plead repeatedly, it will not move the appraiser's heart, and sometimes it will even be sarcastic or mocking. This is a one-sided transaction. Customers standing under the high counter are like a lamb being slaughtered. Even if they are disappointed and heartbroken, they can only endure it and have no room for bargaining.</p>
<p>Although the appraiser has supreme authority, the responsibility is also heavy. They have keen appraisal abilities and are simply walking encyclopedias. The valuation of clothes is, of course, a given, but even gold, silver, jewelry, watches, cameras, etc., require expertise. Sometimes customers send a very strange item, which must be appraised and valued in the shortest possible time. However, in the past, the most difficult to appraise books, paintings, antiques, are now almost non-existent in pawnshops. On the contrary, Chinese clothes are often valued lower in pawnshops in Hongkou. Women's clothes change styles too quickly. Expired qipaos, in terms of style and season, cannot be sold at a good price.</p>
<p>Initially, the interest earned from selling dead goods was not as high as the interest from redemption, but some money could still be earned, 30 to 40% more than the pawn loan. Later, it became the opposite, not only unable to earn money, but also losing 20 to 30%. This was the most declining period of the pawnshop industry. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, everyone faced economic difficulties and had no money to buy new goods, so the expired old clothes in pawnshops were very popular. In recent years, prices have been rising day and night. The market price of old clothes that have been in the pawnshop for two months is higher than it was two months ago, not to mention that the valuation at that time was only 20 to 30% of the market price. Therefore, the loss from selling dead goods is no longer a concern for pawnshops at present. Even lost goods, the date, material, color, and style of the clothing are recorded, printed, and distributed to each pawnshop in the industry. When the appraiser receives this "Death Warrant," they should check the pawnshop's book to see if there are any identical or similar items. If so, they should be taken out and wait for the police station to take them away for the owner to identify. Each police station has a detective who specializes in running to pawnshops, taking a notebook to inquire at each store. If there is one, they will report it for inspection. If there isn't one, they will stamp a pawnshop's seal on the notebook, called "stamping the seal." If the seal has already been stamped, and the thief confesses that the pawned item is in your pawnshop, the police station will file a lawsuit according to the law. Not only will the pawn loan be confiscated, but there will also be detention and fines. If it is voluntarily handed over, after the owner identifies it, the police station will investigate the pawn loan and award the principal and interest.</p>
<p>In the past, the pawning industry had long cooperated with the police departments of the two concessions, but the French Consul suddenly promulgated pawnshop management regulations, ordering the police department to strictly implement them. It stipulates that pawnshops should verify the name, occupation, and address of the pawner and must find a guarantor. The police department</p>
<h3 id="e117">Discussing Pawn Tickets <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>When you bring your clothes to a pawnshop, besides getting a little money, you also get a pawn ticket. This is proof for future redemption. The thin mulberry paper is not only printed vaguely and unclearly, but the items and prices written on it are also like a Daoist's talisman; you can't recognize a single character. It is said that the characters on the pawn ticket are derived from the "Seventeen Calligraphy Posts," mostly only half a character, or unique characters recognized by insiders. These characters are called "pawn script" or "emblem script," which outsiders cannot understand. Not only are the characters on the pawn ticket incomprehensible, but the quality recorded also does not match the original object. Clearly, it is a gold watch, but they always write "broken copper watch." All gold, silver, copper, iron, and other metal items invariably start with the word "broken," and clothes are always marked with "torn and damaged," while leather goods are invariably described as "moth-eaten."</p>
<p>This kind of writing on the pawn ticket is entirely one-sided, fully demonstrating the way landlords dealt with tenant farmers in the past feudal society. However, pawnshop credit is very good, fully possessing the old commercial ethics of China. Even though good items are written as bad ones, they will never be switched out during redemption. But in today's "deteriorating world," that fixed old morality can no longer be maintained. These mysterious symbols allow them to carry out various conspiracies and tricks. In addition to being exploited by high-interest loans, the poor also have to worry about unexpected losses.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Outlet for Dead Goods <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>If an item pledged is not redeemed after the term expires, the interest can be paid to extend the term. If it is neither redeemed nor extended, it is called "dead goods," which the pawnshop sells. Among the goods collected by ordinary pawnshops, clothes are the majority, followed by jewelry. Wooden items and other daily necessities are not accepted by every shop. These dead goods, except for wooden items that are sold through retail, jewelry is exchanged for cash at silver shops, and clothes are assigned to clothing dealers. Many second-hand clothing stores on Stone Road are their main customers. Used clothing is valued the lowest for Western suits and cheongsams. A Western suit is valued at less than 10-20% of the market price, and cheongsams are even cheaper than one-tenth. Because the outlet for Western suits relies only on the used clothing stores on Wusong Road, you can get more money by pawning a Western suit in Hongkou.</p>
<h3 id="e119">"Stop Pawning, Awaiting Redemption" <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>In the summer of 1942, the pawn industry in the former French Concession experienced a wave of turmoil. Every pawnshop posted a red paper sign saying "Industry Notice: Stop Pawning, Awaiting Redemption" or "Temporarily Closed." Pawning is closely related to the lives of ordinary citizens. Once pawnshops collectively stop operating, people waiting for rice to cook immediately feel like they have no way out. Although the pawnshops in the former International Settlement were still open, as long as you carried your clothes and walked a bit further, you could still pawn them for some money to buy firewood and rice, but it caused a lot of unrest among the poor.</p>
<p>Pawnshops are places where thieves can sell stolen goods. If clerks are negligent, they inevitably suffer from being cheated for accepting stolen goods. Whenever the police receive a report from the victim, they send personnel to investigate. If the original stolen goods are found, the police department confiscates them directly and punishes the pawnshop owner for receiving stolen goods. The pawn industry considered this method too harsh, with the risk of being punished at any time. So, they all stopped operating, awaiting redemption. This small wave of turmoil lasted for two days. Later, the French Concession authorities agreed to amend the regulations, and it was quelled.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Municipal Public Pawnshops <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The tide of the times is changing. Formal pawnshops can no longer exist, which has only made many black-hearted small pawnshops become more active. The welfare undertaking originally intended to regulate people's livelihoods has been transformed into blood-sucking leeches that exploit with heavy interest. In order to facilitate pawning for the poor and prevent usury, the municipal government established three public pawnshops, greatly benefiting the poor.</p>
<p>Pawning is a social enterprise to help the poor, so it should be run by the public. After the Taiping Rebellion in Shanghai, the city was devastated and the people's livelihoods were declining. So pawnshops were established to regulate the lives of the poor after the disaster. The funds were allocated by the provincial treasury and were public in nature. Later, because public funds were insufficient, local gentry were entrusted to raise funds, and gradually privately-run pawnshops emerged, but they still retained their relief significance. Later, as small pawnshops rose and large pawnshops found it difficult to establish themselves due to the long terms, they turned into sharp knives that exploited the poor, forming a situation where small pawnshops dominated.</p>
<p>The establishment of municipal public pawnshops was proposed in 1935, but it was not established because funds could not be raised. After the victory, Shanghai, after eight years of enemy looting and traitorous extortion, most citizens suffered from severe "dry blood loss." Countless people lived by pawning. Therefore, the public pawnshops that assisted the civilian economy were actually established in an environment of high interest rates, which is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>There are three municipal public pawnshops: (1) at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Luxiang Garden Road in Nanshi, (2) at No. 22 Chengdu Road, and (3) at the intersection of Robert Road and Caojiadu. Each was allocated a capital of 3 million yuan from the municipal treasury, and the municipal bank signed overdraft contracts of 10 million yuan with each pawnshop to make their funds particularly sufficient. As for the daily expenses of the public pawnshops, they are allocated by the municipal government, and management is entirely under the Social Affairs Bureau. Public pawnshops stipulate a monthly interest rate of 2%, with no storage or warehousing fees, only a one-time handling fee of 5 cents per yuan. The term is three months, with a grace period of 30 days after the expiration, effectively four months. Initially, the maximum amount for each household was 3,000 yuan, but in today's soaring prices, the amount of 3,000 yuan does not interest the poor. Later, with the approval of the municipal government by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was changed to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When the public pawnshops opened, the interest rates were so low that people couldn't believe it. The poor surged in with their clothes, and the capital of 3 million yuan was completely "exhausted" in a few days. Fortunately, there was an overdraft of 10 million yuan from the municipal bank, otherwise it would have been almost impossible to operate. Most of the things pawned are clothes. According to the regulations of the public pawnshops, uniforms, military uniforms, gold and stone calligraphy and paintings, wooden furniture, title deeds, prohibited items, and rare items that cannot be valued cannot be pawned. If there are suspicious items or items with unknown origins, they can also be refused. Apart from clothes, the poor have nothing else of value, and in the current severe winter weather, even the only broken cotton-padded jacket cannot be taken off and sent to the "Everlasting Storage."</p>
<p>The customers of public pawnshops are mostly workers, vendors, and unemployed poor people. The Caojiadu public pawnshop is located in an industrial area, so most of the people who come to pawn are workers. At the Fangbang Road public pawnshop in Nanshi, vendors account for the first place. The customers of Chengdu Road are unemployed poor people. Comparing the business, Jiajiadu ranks first, Fangbang Road is second, and Chengdu Road is the worst. The loans issued by all three have exceeded the capital of 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Public pawnshops were originally established for the poor, so the interest rates are set very low. The municipal government prevented unscrupulous small pawnshops from secretly absorbing capital, so it prohibited them from re-pawning the items they had pawned to the public pawnshops. If it is found that the goods are privately re-pawned, in addition to confiscating the items pawned, the Social Affairs Bureau may be requested to recover the price of the items and the interest, and severe punishment will be imposed without leniency.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Pawnshops Next to Casinos <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Gamblers never realize their mistakes when they lose money. When they lose all their gambling money, they will take off their clothes to pawn them for money, hoping to win back their losses, and finally pawn the pawn ticket for money, making a desperate gamble. Therefore, pawnshops near casinos, like venereal disease doctors in red-light districts, are products of adapting to local conditions.</p>
<p>During the enemy-occupied period, the western part of Shanghai, known as a "bad place," was full of casinos. As a result, special pawnshops that facilitated gamblers also sprang up like mushrooms after rain. They mostly had only one storefront, and their customers were naturally mainly gamblers. The clothes pawned were far less than the pawn tickets, and as for gold and silver jewelry, they could be used directly in the casino, so they were rarely seen.</p>
<p>Shanghai's small pawnshops can be considered extremely black-hearted, but the conditions set by pawnshops near casinos are even more outrageous. A pawn ticket normally worth one yuan can only be pawned for ten cents, and the valuation of clothes and other items is even lower than elsewhere. The interest is three cents per dime, with a term of five days. If it is not redeemed, it will be sold.</p>
<p>The interest here is so high that it has reached the extreme (at that time, the general interest rate in Shanghai was very low). At the same time, because the valuation is so low, even if it is not redeemed, selling the items can still bring in a lot of money. The capital is light and the interest is heavy, beyond comparison. It is truly a "man-eating" place. Gamblers are addicted to gambling, refuse to see the error of their ways, pawn things for money, and then lose the money they pawned, and then pawn the pawn tickets. Therefore, pawnshops near casinos are bustling with activity, and their business is really not bad!</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Inside Story of Redeeming Pledges for Customers <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Some small pawnshops in Shanghai, in addition to pawning clothes and goods, also allow you to pawn pawn tickets. "A pawn ticket worth ten yuan can generally be pawned for one yuan, with an interest of three cents per dime, with three cents as a unit, and a term of five days. If it is not redeemed, it will be sold immediately. If the interest is more than nine cents, it is counted as one dime. This harsh condition is appalling. Suppose a pawn ticket with a face value of one yuan is pawned for one dime, and you go to redeem it after five days, it will cost two dimes. Because the pawned dime is counted as three dimes for interest, and the nine cents interest is increased to one dime. At the same time, the numbers on the pawn ticket are originally only 30-40% of the value of the goods, and now it is discounted by another 10%, so even if it is not redeemed, you can always make money. This is called pawnshop in name, but is a black shop in reality.</p>
<p>This way of mortgaging pawn tickets gradually evolved with society, giving rise to a new business of "redeeming pledges for customers." What those who redeem pledges for customers pay attention to are valuable items such as gold and silver jewelry, because the highest that pawnshops accept for these items will not exceed 60% of the original price. When the term expires, if the ticket holder cannot prepare the funds for redemption or pay the interest for extension, isn't he just watching the pawnshop take away his items for only 60% of the price? Redeeming pledges for customers is to act as an intermediary, temporarily paying a sum of money to redeem the items and then obtain some profit from the exchange. On the ticket holder's side, it is also happy to bear.</p>
<p>It is said that redeeming pledges for customers was conceived by the owner of Lu Tianbao Silver Shop on Jinshenfu Road, and those who followed sprang up like mushrooms. Dozens of quasi-silver shops were newly opened, all with redeeming pledges for customers as their only business. Although it is said to be a way of paying funds to earn a few percent for miscellaneous expenses and a few percent for transportation costs, after redeeming the items, a discount is still given on the gold, and the price per tael of gold is always dozens of yuan lower than the market price. At this time, the "sheep has entered the tiger's mouth" and can only cry in vain. They make considerable profits in a turnover. Therefore, those who operate redeeming pledges for customers make at least three times the profit, and the first one has already accumulated tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Suppose a pawn ticket cannot be traded after being redeemed by a customer due to the price difference. In that case, other remedial measures can be used: (1) Send the redeemed gold jewelry to the pawnshop for pawning again, raising the normal price as high as possible above the original pawn price. The pawn ticket is kept by the shop, and a receipt is issued, stating that the owner will pay the remaining amount on time. If it expires, the shop will redeem it to compensate for the loss. (2) If it is a diamond, pearl, etc., take it to a jewelry store for valuation and set the transaction price. If the shop thinks that the estimated price is questionable, the customer can sell it, and the shop will only take back the original amount after the sale. These complete conditions cannot help but surprise people. Although profit can be made, carrying valuable jewelry and large sums of money back and forth on the road is also somewhat dangerous.</p>
<p>After the rise of the business of redeeming pledges for customers, the clerks in general pawnshops were greatly affected. Originally, the expired goods in the pawnshops were stipulated to be sold by the copper and tin shops and the extraction shops. However, if the price of the goods is lower than the pawn principal, the loss is compensated by the clerk who priced it. However, there is never any loss or compensation for gold and silver jewelry, so the clerk must try to prevent it from being "lost." If it expires and is not redeemed, they can profit from it. Since the trend of redeeming pledges for customers is prevalent, clerks cannot profit from this, so they conspired to retaliate, secretly raising the normal price of jewelry. When redemption merchants come to redeem, they will first state that the goods cannot be re-pawned at the original price after redemption. Therefore, redeeming pledges for customers often encounters "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." This scene of clashes between clerks and redemption merchants has allowed the poor who beg for help from the "Everlasting Storage" to reap a little profit.</p>
<p>Redeeming pledges for customers, the former Public Works Bureau believed that it could open up a new way for thieves to sell stolen goods, and issued an order to ban it, so they closed down one after another. However, most of these shops use the business of gold, silver, and jewelry as a cover. The larger ones display various jewelry in the windows, just like silver shops. Although they dare not openly operate, they are still quite active in secret.</p>
<p>There is still a kind that hangs a sign of "×× Trading Company" outside. On the surface, it looks like a second-hand goods shop, but it also operates the business of "buying pawn tickets." For pawn tickets of large pawnshops, where the pawned items are more valuable, such as cameras and fountain pens, they all buy them, and the price they offer is only 20-30% of the pawn ticket. The normal price of these goods is usually 30-40% of the price of the goods. If you add the purchase cost, it only amounts to 50-60% of the price of the goods. After they buy the pawn tickets, they repair the goods slightly or refurbish them, and they can wait for a good price and sell them, making a good profit.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Most Magnificent Pawnshop <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The poor are spread all over every corner of the world. The pawnshop, known as the "blessing of the common people," exists everywhere and is not a specialty of our country. This most magnificent pawnshop in the world is not in the richest America, nor in the historical Europe, but in the capital of Argentina in South America.</p>
<p>In the center of Buenos Aires, there is a very exquisite five-story building with beautiful windows, neat semi-circular counters, and an orderly layout. The door displays the words Casa de Ventas. People who come to Buenos Aires for the first time will definitely point and ask, is this a department store? In fact, it is a pawnshop managed by the municipal government, which can be said to be the most magnificent pawnshop in the world. In such a large pawnshop, citizens come in and out like they are walking into a bank, dignified and without any shame.</p>
<p>This pawnshop accepts anything and has no limit on loans. It once accepted a diamond as collateral, with a loan amount of 120,000 pesos. It also accepted an airplane, which was later sold for ten yuan. Currently, it has accepted 10,000 sewing machines, 2,500 pianos, and many other items such as telescopes and wedding dresses. As for wedding rings, people are reluctant to pawn them until they are desperate.</p>
<p>At the corner of the building is the valuation room, where people come and go all day long. Citizens enter the valuation room, sit and wait in a small room, and the staff takes the items to be pledged in to the valuator. The original owner of the item and the valuator are not allowed to meet face to face, because they are afraid that they will collude. After the valuation is completed, the pledger leaves with the money, never arguing about more or less, because the price paid is always more than that paid by other private pawnshops.</p>
<p>After the pledged items expire, they are auctioned publicly. Complete sets of tableware, chairs and tables, various radios, typewriters, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the windows, with small signs attached, indicating the number and the lowest bid price. If you cannot go to the auction yourself, you only need to pay a handling fee of five cents and a deposit of 20%, and someone will handle it for you. If a customer wants to buy something but does not see it on display, they only need to leave their name and phone number, and they will be notified when the item is for sale. This kind of service spirit is considered meticulous.</p>
<p>They also strive to serve the owners. After the pledged items are sold, the profits are returned to the original owner after deducting the interest due. There are also those who have pledged items and still pay interest on time for more than ten years. There was a woman who pledged a piano for 25 years. Finally, the pawnshop management decided to return it to the original owner. Every year, they also draw lots to return winter clothes and blankets pledged by the poor. This spirit of being loyal and serving the public is truly admirable. People in South America call it a "conscientious pawnshop," which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>They have also done many charitable undertakings. In 1938, they funded a hospital to build a tuberculosis sanatorium and outpatient clinic to benefit the poor and sick. In addition, they have loaned money to various cities to help them build roads and repay debts. In 1934, the loan to the Buenos Aires city government totaled 20 million pesos.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be explained. Foreign pawnshops are also located in narrow alleys, mostly dirty and unsightly small shops with disorganized windows. People are reluctant to step into their doors unless they are at their wits' end. The pawnshop in Buenos Aires is an exception.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Silk Weaving Industry on the Verge of Bankruptcy - Called an Extraordinary Emergency Meeting Yesterday - To Discuss Countermeasures - Loan Interest, Annual Bonuses, and Substitute Weaving Were All Discussed - Representatives Will Be Sent to Petition Various Parties <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association recently suffered greatly from the exploitation of high-interest loans, as its members had no access to loans. In addition, raw materials and labor are both expensive, but the selling price of products is depressed and does not cover costs. It is currently on the verge of being unable to sustain itself. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the Association specially held an extraordinary emergency meeting of members at the Kang Le Restaurant to jointly discuss how to deal with countermeasures. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Xianqing, and the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other agencies, as well as members of the Association, totaling 250-260 people, attended. The meeting was presided over by the Association's current Chairman, Cai Xintao, and Standing Director, Liu Qingyi. After the Chairman delivered the opening speech, representatives from various agencies delivered speeches one after another. Finally, three important cases were discussed: (1) Loan issues: Currently, the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank have already provided low-interest loans to the industry. However, the number of members who can borrow is only one-quarter of the total membership. Moreover, it has been found that the loan requires a 70% discount on raw materials and finished products as collateral. However, factories rely on raw materials for production and finished products for sales. Because of the collateral relationship, it is necessary to lock them up in the warehouses of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank, causing outsiders who do not know the details to think that the factories have no inventory, and they began to demand debts. As a result, obtaining a loan has been forced down by the loan. In the past week, another five or six members have announced liquidation, and the situation is very serious. After discussion, it was decided to appeal to the Standing Committee to improve the loan method. The suggested method is to issue loans of 12 million yuan per weaving machine, with half of the collateral being products and finished products, and the other half being machines. Half of the borrowed funds will be used to repay old high-interest debts, and half will be used to purchase raw materials. It was also decided to send 20 representatives, including Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, Song Baolin, Qian Xubao, Tong Xinbo, and Shen Rongfu, to petition the Temporary Loan Committee for Production on the next two days. If it does not work, all 330 members will line up this Wednesday to go to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Production Loan Committee to petition separately. If it still does not work, the 20 representatives will carry their submissions to Nanjing to petition Chairman Chiang, the National Assembly, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Four Joint Offices. If there is still no result, the industry will have to resort to a complete shutdown, and all of the industry's 20,000 workers will be unemployed. (2) Annual bonus issue: Recently, the Municipal Government held a meeting to discuss the annual bonus method for piecework wages, and decided to continue to handle it according to the past situation. As far as the situation in the silk weaving industry is concerned, there has been no annual bonus practice in the past. Moreover, the situation this year is special. Members have no way to apply for loans and no profits to speak of. Moreover, the average monthly income of silk weaving workers is more than 300,000 yuan per person. If each person is to be given an annual bonus for one month, the total burden that all members must spend for the annual bonus will be between 3 and 4 billion yuan. In the case of a larger factory with 300 workers, it will have to bear a huge amount of 100 million yuan. In this time of desperation, where can there be extra strength to pay this additional burden? Therefore, it was decided to submit the actual situation to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for their records. (3) Substitute weaving of silk fabrics: Currently, the government's purchase of raw silk is costly, and due to competition with Japanese silk, it is difficult to export and must suffer losses. In view of this, the silk weaving industry has specially requested the authorities to hand over the batch of purchased raw silk to the silk weaving industry association's member factories for substitute weaving of silk fabrics. Because Chinese silk fabrics have better sales in the international market and the selling price is also better than raw silk. It is estimated that the foreign exchange obtained from exporting and selling silk fabrics after weaving can be doubled compared to raw silk. The relevant authorities have now agreed in principle and decided to promote its realization. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Financial Industry Trends - General Business is Not Bad - Will Not Use Dime and Cent Units - Year-End Bonuses According to Precedent <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Financial circles news: A larger bank in the city is seeking the consent of other banks to stop using dime and cent units on accounting books from New Year's Day next year. It is said that after most banks agree, the suggestion will be submitted to the Banking Association and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to a banking expert, the unit below one yuan has no other use except for paying direct taxes. Auxiliary coins are, in fact, no longer an effective payment instrument today. If the unit of dime and cent can be omitted from the bank's accounting books, it can save a lot of energy for service personnel. However, this matter must be implemented after the approval of the Ministry of Finance. It is also said that the business situation of general banks in the city this year is not bad, but the Sichuan banks are not familiar with the situation in Shanghai, so they have suffered bad debts, but it will not be a big problem. The year-end bonuses of the banking industry have precedents to follow and will not cause new disputes. Over the past year, labor disputes have inevitably occurred in the banking industry, but they have been resolved on their own before they escalated.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Silk for Silk - Agreed in Principle - Processing Plan Undecided <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Silk factories in this city are negotiating with the China Trust Bureau to discuss detailed methods of exchanging silk for silk. According to relevant sources, the government has agreed in principle to supply low-priced raw silk to cooperating factories and recover the finished silk fabrics for overseas distribution. This matter is also beneficial to the government, because the government can only obtain 800 US dollars of foreign exchange for the export of one dan of raw silk, but if one dan of raw silk is woven into silk fabrics for export, the government can obtain 1,200 US dollars of foreign exchange. Comparing the two, it is obviously beneficial. However, having the state supply the cooperating silk factories with raw materials and recovering the silk fabrics after weaving involves very complex issues, including organization, division of labor, and joint industry. A dedicated institution must be set up to handle it in an orderly manner. Therefore, this matter requires the silk factories to propose a detailed and feasible plan and program as the basis for negotiation. Moreover, if the silk factories can obtain a supply of low-priced raw silk, their products do not have to be sold exclusively to the United States, because the price of silk fabrics in Southeast Asia and India is far higher than that in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Coal Briquette Supply and Demand Issues: Fuel Management Committee Strives to Regulate, Demand Surges Beyond Budget, Unclogging Sources and Increasing Raw Material Allocation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A certain responsible person from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs told our reporter that the supply and demand situation of white coal dust, the raw material for coal briquettes in this city, has been quite normal. In the previous few months, an estimated four to five thousand tons per month were sufficient to meet the demand. Unexpectedly, in recent months, the demand has suddenly surged to more than ten thousand tons. Therefore, the Committee's original plan of sixty thousand tons of white coal dust being sufficient for the entire city for a year has now been shattered. It is said that the main consumers of white coal dust are machine-made coal briquette businesses. Because the market price of white coal dust in both this city and other areas has risen sharply, the white coal dust allocated by the authorities may be resold for profit, which will affect the quality of coal briquettes and their normal production volume. It is reported that the Fuel Management Committee has a contract with Vietnam to purchase 100,000 tons of white coal dust, which the Committee regularly sends ships to transport. Recently, due to the outbreak of war in Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, the normal transportation volume has been affected. Fortunately, the Committee still has considerable reserves in this city, which are sufficient to meet temporary needs. In addition, it has been decided to allocate 2,000 tons each of small white coal blocks and semi-smokeless coal, crush them into dust, and allocate them to machine-made coal briquette businesses to manufacture coal briquettes, which will then be sold by coal briquette retailers. It is also reported that recently, 18,000 tons of white coal are expected to arrive continuously from Vietnam, which will be transported by the Yunitae, Niger Maru, and Tangier vessels respectively. Among them, the Yunitae ship, loaded with more than 5,500 tons of white coal, set sail from Vietnam on the 6th, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 18th.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Import and Export Industry: Discussion of Quotas <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Compilation of Statistics for Reference</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Industry Association is holding a series of panel meetings this week. In addition to the cotton panel and the pigment panel, which have already been held, the industrial raw materials panel, the rubber panel, the hardware panel, etc., will be convened soon. Statistical figures will be compiled for the past imports and current actual demand for the above-mentioned important imports, which will be used as a basis for the government to determine quotas. The investigation forms for cotton demand are still being collected, and the statistical work has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] China, India, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Nations are all interested in purchasing cotton. A certain well-known spot trading firm has accepted orders from France for approximately 7,000 bales. It is rumored that the relevant parties are currently in negotiations to establish a government-supported management bank to restore private company funding for cotton exports. It is also said that the Commodity Credit Corporation recently accepted a Japanese order for 367,000 bales of American cotton, to be delivered in 1947. The above rumors have attracted considerable attention from the cotton industry.</p>

<p>[Hong Kong, 14th] The first batch of 5,500 bales of Japanese cotton yarn will arrive in Hong Kong at the end of the month and will be distributed to various textile factories for use. The textile industry, which was on the verge of collapse, has been revitalized. Factories that had previously closed have now resumed operations one after another, and the ban on the export of cotton textiles is expected to be lifted.</p>

<p>Qu Qu Sheng, representative of the joint office of the National Fisheries and Vegetables Corporation and supervisor of the Zhejiang Fisheries Construction Association, went to Beijing for the second time yesterday to negotiate the matter of the RMB 1 billion Zhejiang Province fishing loan approved by Chairman Chiang of the National Government. It is now learned that the China Farmers Bank's board of directors has internally decided on four principles for the aforementioned RMB 1 billion fishing loan: (1) Focus on the coastal areas of Zhejiang, (2) Provide direct loans to fishermen, (3) The provincial government and the commissioner's offices and county governments in the localities will act as guarantors, and (4) The cooperative societies in various places and the director of the Provincial Fisheries Administration will act as supervisors. The China Farmers Bank authorities have also compiled the records and allocated amounts from the Ningbo-area fishing loan distribution meeting and submitted them to the Joint Treasury for approval. Once approved, the Zhejiang Province branch will be instructed to provide loans nearby. However, Representative Zhao stated that various localities have high hopes for the aforementioned fishing loan, so he personally requested the China Farmers Bank authorities to expedite the process, and it may be issued around the end of this month. The flight of speculative capital and remittances from overseas Chinese to Hong Kong has created unprecedented financial activity. American banks (American Express), (Citibank), and (Chase) are aggressively providing loans in a speculative manner. This matter has attracted the attention of British banks, and they may resume lending in the short term to compete with American banks.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Industrial and Commercial Recession: Machine Factories Hit Hard, Half Are in a State of Stagnation <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a responsible person from the Machinery Industry Association told reporters: In the current state of overall industrial and commercial recession, the machinery industry has been hit the hardest. Currently, there are more than 700 machine factories in this city that have joined the Association. More than 90% of them cannot sustain themselves. For the past few months, there has been a phenomenon of bankruptcies every month, and to date, no less than dozens of them have closed. Even those who are barely surviving have 50% of their operations in a state of stagnation. None of them are operating at full capacity. Factories that used to have three to four hundred workers before the war are now only maintaining the remnants with seventy to eighty workers. There is no production of complete machines; they are only manufacturing machine parts or providing machinery repair services for factories as their business scope. Factories that are relatively more sustainable are those that produce textile machinery, fiber machinery, and machine tools, because the textile industry in Shanghai is relatively developed. One-quarter of the industry, 200 factories, has applied to the government for industrial loans, totaling RMB 5.1 billion. Although the government has agreed to consider it, there has been no concrete decision to date. Even if the loans are approved, they can only help a portion of the machine factories. Therefore, the machinery industry is truly on the verge of imminent danger.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Governor of Macau: Issues New Subsidiary Currency, Scheduled for Use on New Year's Day Next Year <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Macau] Recently, Macau's subsidiary currency has been worn out and in short supply, and the market circulation has been sluggish, causing merchants to suffer. In response to the merchants' request, the Macau government petitioned Lisbon for approval to issue new currency. According to the official gazette published by the Macau government yesterday, the Finance Department of the Portuguese colony recently approved the printing of 3.01 million yuan of new subsidiary currency for Macau, to be issued by the Governor of Macau. The new currency is expected to be issued around January 1st of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Fishermen's Children are Poor for Generations: A Picture of the Miserable Condition of Fishermen, Family Property Gone, Tools Destroyed, Oppressed by High Interest Rates, Living in Dire Poverty: Tang Kexiang Reports After Returning to Shanghai from Inspection <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank, in order to revitalize China's fishing industry and launch large-scale fishing loans, previously sent personnel directly to the coastal areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the conditions in fishing villages. At that time, the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and representatives from various sectors of the fishing industry were invited, spending a total of three weeks, passing through Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Dagu, and Qingdao. According to Tang Kexiang, director of the loan department of the bank, who participated in the previous inspection, China's fish-producing areas in North China are most abundant in Hebei Province, which was estimated to have an annual output of more than 100 billion yuan before the war, and Shandong Province, which had an output of 600 to 700 million yuan. Such a large income can invigorate the rural economy and enrich the national treasury, which is of great benefit. Before the victory, they were oppressed by the Japanese and could not develop fully. After the war, everything was waiting to be rebuilt. The Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration even allowed the use of construction materials to assist our country, which is a rare opportunity for the recovery of the fishing industry. It is learned that the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration plans to provide more than 120 fishing vessels, of which 34 have already been shipped. In addition, all the materials for fishing boats will be supplied, which can be used to build 10,000 fishing boats and distributed to various sectors. The fishing boats are aimed at fishermen, while the fishing vessels are managed by fishing companies. Tang continued, the thing that fishermen feel most lacking is production tools, because fishing boats and fishing nets were severely damaged during the war and they were unable to replenish them. For example, in more than a dozen fishing villages near Tianjin, the tools that were destroyed accounted for more than 50%. In the Qingdao area, five fishing villages also accounted for more than 30%. The family property of the fishermen was gone, and they had to work as laborers, swimming in the seabed to collect kelp in exchange for meager wages. Before entering the sea, they must drink a little sorghum wine. After coming out of the water, their bellies are as big as drums, and they must vomit forcefully several times a day before they can eat. The suffering is unbearable to witness. In addition, there is a lack of climate measurement and reporting at sea. They rely entirely on experience to deal with changes in ocean currents. Once there is an accident, their lives have no guarantee. The issue of maritime security is also extremely important. The presence of pirates has a significant impact on production. The above points are all reasons for the downturn in the fishing industry. The hierarchy of the fishing industry starts from the fishermen, fishmongers, ice and fresh boats, fish markets, fish vendors, and finally to fish stalls. Among them, fishmongers and fish markets have the closest relationship with fishermen, and the exploitation of fishermen is also the most severe. In fishing villages, high-interest loans are also rampant. The degree of harm is even greater than in Shanghai. For example, when fishermen lack funds to purchase fishing gear, the above-mentioned institutions will provide a sum of cash. When it comes to paying back the principal and interest, cash is never used. Instead, it is replaced by the treasures obtained by the fishermen every day. In this way, the lending institutions buy fresh goods at low prices every day, paying very little compensation, and also deduct weight to repay debts, which is endless, and many are not paid off for several generations. The saying "Fishermen's children are poor for generations" is truly a realistic description. Tang concluded by saying that the bank is aware of this, and before launching fishing loans, it is necessary to eradicate this bad habit, starting from the self-reliance of the fishermen and aiming at self-transportation and self-sales, that is, loans should be aimed directly at the fishermen, going deep into the fishing villages, first establishing fishing associations in various places, electing chairmen, gathering fishermen as members, and having the chairmen take responsibility for leadership. The above-mentioned organization is best developed in Qingdao, and relatively slow in Tianjin, because the former has more popular education in fishing villages.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs recently received a telegram from President Song stating that foreign ships are temporarily not allowed to sail to the ports of Qinhuangdao and Qingdao. Liu Bingyi, the Customs Commissioner, specifically notified the shipping merchants to be informed. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the ports of Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Jiangmen, and Leizhou were previously ordered to temporarily allow foreign ships to go to trade and trade, and were announced to the public in Announcement No. 14 to No. 20. Now, it has been ordered by the government that foreign ships will be temporarily suspended from going to the ports of Qinhuangdao and Qingdao for trade and trade. From now on, foreign ships will be temporarily not allowed to go to the two ports for trade and trade, except for those specially permitted by the government."</p>
<p>International Economy</p>
<h3 id="e136">The United States is Also Experiencing Inflation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— (Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper from the New York Morning Post)</p>
<p>I. Observations on Current Prices</p>
<p>Prices Rise Across the Board, Especially for Clothing and Food</p>
<p>Although most people predicted that prices in the United States would fall, a new round of inflation has occurred in the past week. The cost of living for the average citizen has not only not decreased, but is also continuing to rise. In the first week after the authorities announced the lifting of price controls, everyone was talking about prices trending downward, but the reality is that all prices are still fluctuating. Perhaps this is the "last burst" of inflation, but it has already reached its peak.</p>
<p>In September of this year, the cost of living in the United States was 46% higher than the average cost of living from 1935 to 1939. Although the authorities have not yet announced the exact figures, the upward trend in the future may reach 50% higher than before the war. The cost of living in New York is higher than in other places, and the rate of increase is also greater. At the beginning of this year, the cost of living in New York was 2.5% higher than the national average, but currently it is 3.5% higher than the national average. Only rent has increased the least, slightly suppressing the cost of living. Rent is less than 2% higher than in 1939; fuel and other housing costs are 19% higher; but food is 90% higher than in 1939; clothing is 85% higher; and furniture is 70% higher. The above figures do not include the recent price increases. In the first two days after the announcement of the lifting of price controls, the prices of 28 major commodities rose by 7.4%. The most severe increases were in hardware, scrap iron, and chemical raw materials. The prices of rayon fabrics, raw wool, and carpets have all risen. Various machines and radios produced by major factories have reached new highs, rising 60% compared to the previous week. General Electric's washing machines soared 30% overnight. Other items such as automobiles and agricultural implements have all been affected by inflation.</p>
<p>There are very few varieties of goods that have fallen in price, and the most significant is the fluctuating price of cotton. Fur goods have fallen in price by 30% to 50% since this spring. Other goods that have fallen in price include the following: women's wool sweaters, men's sportswear, handkerchiefs, and certain brands of lesser-known radios.</p>
<p>As a result of high prices, the cost of living has exceeded workers' wages. In January 1946, the average weekly wage was $41.15, which increased to $45.10 in September of the same year, but it is far behind the rapidly increasing cost of living!</p>
<p>Another result of inflation is the sharp reduction in savings rates. In 1944, the national people of the United States could save $39 billion annually, in 1945, overseas Chinese businessmen saved $35 billion, but in 1946, the total national savings decreased to $17 billion. This means that many Americans have no savings at all, and some have even exhausted their resources and are heavily in debt.</p>
<p>II. Outlook on Future Prices</p>
<p>The Trend is Still Rising, Life is Becoming Difficult</p>
<p>In the coming months, many essential commodities in high demand will inevitably rise in price again. Here is an estimate: The latest outlook for food prices is that they will increase compared to last week. The prices of meat, butter, and eggs are already rising. From a long-term perspective, your food bills in 1947 may have no hope of decreasing, and if there is any decrease, it will only fluctuate slightly with the seasons. Regarding clothing, except for rayon, it is generally accepted that the prices of other goods have already risen enough. There will be discounts and clearance sales after Christmas. Next spring, especially for women's clothing, prices will gradually decline. Even men's clothing is weak and sluggish, and several types of suits and shirts have already been reduced in price.</p>
<p>However, the prices of household goods, which are in the most urgent demand, will increase. It is estimated that the price of so-called cheap furniture will soon increase by 30%. The biggest obstacle in the process of furniture price increases is reducing production. Most people will not be able to afford such high prices.</p>
<p>Among the major automobile manufacturers, only General Motors has increased the prices of its products. Other companies say that they will not increase prices if the prices of raw materials do not increase. However, the prices of raw materials have been increasing since then.</p>
<p>The high prices of rent and construction are the biggest threat to the cost of living today. The Office of Price Administration is currently considering the owners' request to increase rent by 15%, and the submission also stipulates a method for gradually lifting the rent control system. Regarding housing, the government spokesman no longer believes that the current price of a new house for veterans is possible at $10,000. The price of a standard six-room wood-frame house has risen to $13,000. If there is a decrease in housing prices in the future, it will definitely start with older and larger houses. Small houses will still be in urgent demand and sold at high prices, at least until 1948.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Another Henan Farce: Funds for Military Grain in Fangcheng County Disappear for a Second Time; Greed Overwhelms Reason, Suspects Re-offend <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Kaifeng on the 7th, by Our Reporter in Bian, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>This year has truly been a year of corruption. In murky waters, both high and low officials have discarded their service ethics, and everyone is scheming to exploit their positions for personal gain. The slogans of "purifying officialdom" and "eradicating corruption" have long been drowned out by the clamor of corruption and malfeasance. Demons dance wildly; the official arena this year is filled with dark and ominous miasma! As the year draws to a close, our hearts are filled with sorrow and anxiety. We wish we could tear away these remaining pages of the old year and usher in a bright tomorrow, so that our pens would no longer have to depict such dirty and ugly farces in the officialdom as we have this year, but instead could use vibrant colors to paint a picture of brightness. We are waiting, we are hoping! However, in reality, we cannot put down our pens and ignore the dirty reality. Now I am still holding my pen, with a painful heart, to write the second act of the Henan farce for our readers. This may be the final act, as the year ends and the month is over, and the "Year of Corruption" is almost over.</p>
<p>Everyone Loves Military Grain Funds; Ignoring Past Mistakes, They Only Seek Profit</p>
<p>The Fangcheng County military grain funds embezzlement case, which caused a sensation in Henan, including the temporary currency transactions and the dismissal and detention of the main character Zhao Zuo'an and the supporting actor Fan Zuomin, has already been reported in detail to our readers by this reporter on the 25th of last month. After the arrest of Zhao, Fan, and other accomplices, the public has been watching how the government will punish Zhao. Unexpectedly, the military grain funds that were squeezed out of the thieves' mouths disappeared again on their way to Fangcheng. Top officials in the province, such as the Director of Finance Fan Zuomin and the Magistrate of Fangcheng County Zhao Zuo'an, were dismissed and detained because of this case, yet someone still dared to set their sights on these funds and use them privately for business ventures. One can only imagine how ruthless and audacious this person is. The decline of service ethics among civil servants to this point is truly astonishing! Therefore, it is indeed true that this case is filled with dramatic tension. The reason for this is that out of the 129 million yuan of military grain funds in Fangcheng County, besides the 19 million yuan privately withdrawn by Xue Binqing for illegal business operations, the remaining 110 million yuan that Fan Zuomin had manipulated was pursued by Sun Luzhan, the secretary of the Fangcheng County Council, Zhu Wenbin, the former director of the Grain and Field Department, and Yuan Ziyu, a member of the Youth League, who went to the provincial capital to investigate. Fan Zuomin, in a flurry of activity, arranged for the Provincial Bank to remit 80 million yuan to Xuchang and 10 million yuan each to Xiangxian and Yexian. The remaining 10 million yuan, along with the deposit slips from the Xuchang, Xiang, and Ye branches, were handed over by Fan Zuomin to the representatives Sun Luzhan and others to take back. In theory, Sun and others should have taken the collection procedures from each branch back to Fangcheng to report, and the county should have sent people to the branches to withdraw the money. However, they did not fully follow this procedure; otherwise, the second act of this ugly drama would not have been presented to the readers. Seeing that the military grain funds had already been remitted, Sun Luzhan and others set out to return home. At this time, the case had already caused a stir, and they knew that County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an had been dismissed. The new magistrate had just arrived, and there would naturally be a period of transition. When they passed through Xuchang, they handed the 80 million yuan check remitted to the Xuchang branch to Sun Lingyun, the director of the accounting department of the Xuchang branch (who is Sun Luzhan's nephew). Except for Sun Luzhan who stayed in Xuchang, Zhu and Yuan returned. As soon as they left, County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an was detained and escorted to the provincial capital. On the day County Magistrate Zhao was escorted through Xuchang (October 9th), Sun Lingyun withdrew all 80 million yuan and temporarily deposited it in the name of Yuji as a Class A current deposit. Then, he lent 5 million yuan at 10% interest to the Yilicheng Tea House in Xuchang, ... 2 million ... company ... 1 million, and hoarded 20 million yuan of tobacco leaves in the salt and tobacco ... Sun Lingyun kept the remaining 10 million yuan for himself. This trick was done secretly, without anyone knowing. The uncle and nephew were quite pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>Sun Luzhan Detained and Escorted to the Province; 50 Million Yuan in Cash Recovered</p>
<p>On October 23rd, Sun Luzhan returned to Fangcheng, but to his surprise, County Magistrate Wang Jingxiu sent representatives Yuan Ziyu and others to Xuchang on October 25th to collect the money. He was very alarmed and anxious, and on October 29th, he hurriedly went to Xuchang and pleaded with Yuan Ziyu and others in every possible way, asking them not to publicize the matter. After discussing with Yuan and others, Sun Luzhan drafted a telegram for Yuan to send to County Magistrate Wang, stating that the funds were not yet due and requesting County Magistrate Wang to allow them to bring back the original loan receipt, attempting to delay the pursuit. After the telegram was sent, Sun rushed back to the county on November 1st to make arrangements. That evening, he visited County Magistrate Wang... requested County Magistrate Wang to verbally agree, but used the excuse that it was after working hours and the drafting staff were not available to send a reply telegram. At the same time, he secretly telegraphed the provincial government about the second disappearance of the military grain funds and sent people to safely recover 10 million yuan each from Xiangxian and Yexian. He also strictly pursued the 80 million yuan in Xuchang. Before long, he received an order from the provincial government to escort the relevant criminals to the provincial capital. At this point, Sun Luzhan was detained and escorted to Kaifeng, and Sun Lingyun was also dismissed and detained and is currently on his way to the provincial capital. It is said that only 55 million yuan in cash has been recovered from the 80 million yuan in military grain funds, and the remaining 25 million yuan was used to offset tobacco leaves and paper...</p>
<p>After Sun Luzhan was escorted to the province, he was detained. It is said that he was interrogated once and claimed that Zhu Wenbin gave the withdrawal slip to Sun Lingyun, and he knew nothing about the fraudulent activities. However, Zhu Wenbin claimed that he knew nothing at all, and Yuan Ziyu also did not know. The collusion and fraud were only understood by the Sun uncle and nephew.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Construction of New Sichuan's New Education: A Conversation with Director Liu Mingyang <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Chengdu on the 7th, by Our Reporter in Rong, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Sichuan Province has long been known for its developed education system. Since Wen Weng governed Shu during the Han Dynasty, he widely promoted education, established schools, and promoted culture and education, greatly opening up the atmosphere of Shu. The prosperity of Shu education at that time was comparable to that of Qi and Lu. After more than two thousand years of development, Sichuan education has always held a leading position among the western provinces of China. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the central government moved westward, and universities from all over the country moved to Sichuan one after another. Sichuan's education flourished for a time, becoming the center of national culture and education. After the victory, education was restored. The current situation of Sichuan education after the restoration has attracted the attention of people from all over the country. To this end, the reporter specially visited Mr. Liu Mingyang, the Director of the Department of Education of Sichuan Province, for a long conversation. Mr. Liu comprehensively discussed the current situation of Sichuan's education after the restoration and the future educational work policies in detail, providing reference for the education community.</p>
<p>Sichuan Education Since the Restoration</p>
<p>First, talking about the current situation of Sichuan's education, starting from three stages: Before the war, Sichuan's education had quantity but no quality. Although there were three universities, Sichuan University, West China University, and Chongqing University, higher education was limited by funding and the quality was very poor. Secondary education was more common, but social and national education were not very developed. This was the initial stage of Sichuan's education. During the war, universities from all over the country moved inland. At its peak, Sichuan had a total of 28 universities. For example, Chongqing had five universities, including the Central Political School, Central University, Fudan University, and Zhonghua University. Leshan had Wuhan University and the Central Vocational School. Santai had Northeastern University. Xuyong had the Southwest Associated University Graduate School. Wanxian had Shanghai Law School. Jiangjin had the Women's Normal College, etc. Chengdu at that time had nine universities, including Sichuan University, West China University, Qilu University, Yenching University, Ginling University, Guanghua University, Ginling Women's University, the Medical College of Central University, and Sichuan-Kang Agricultural and Industrial College, known as the national cultural city. At the same time, secondary, social, and national education also progressed rapidly in response to the needs of the times and reality. This was the prosperous period of Sichuan's education. After the victory, schools were restored. Sichuan's education declined from the wartime prosperity, but due to the deeply rooted foundation of Sichuan's education in the past, and the support and efforts of the central and local governments since the War of Resistance, Sichuan's education entered the third stage, that is, the current period of development. According to the statistics of this year, the current situation of Sichuan's education is as follows: Higher education: a total of 13 schools above the junior college level, including 4 universities, 3 independent colleges, and 6 junior colleges. The distribution includes National Sichuan University (President Huang Jilu) in Chengdu, Private West China University (President Fang Shu), Chengdu China University (formerly Guanghua University reorganized, President Wang Zhaorong), and Sichuan-Kang Agricultural and Industrial College (President Wei Shizhen), and three provincial-level vocational schools of accounting, sports, and art. Chongqing has National Chongqing University (President Zhang Hongyuan), Provincial Education College (President Yan Yu), and National Central Industrial College. Jiangjin has National Women's Normal College (President Xie Fuchu). Leshan has National Central Vocational School. Zigong has National Zigong Industrial College, etc., with a total of 12,000 students. Secondary education: There are currently 711 middle schools in Sichuan, including 8 national middle schools, 546 public and private ordinary middle schools, 85 normal schools, and 72 vocational schools, with a total of 233,269 students. Social education: There are a total of 1 provincial-level and 156 county and municipal-level public education centers in Sichuan, 1 provincial-level and 79 county and municipal-level libraries, and 26 private libraries. National education: There are currently 2,733 complete primary schools and 23,520 national schools in Sichuan, with 3,824,843 children enrolled, accounting for more than 80% of the school-age children in Sichuan. Judging from the above overall situation, Sichuan's education at the current stage is obviously in the process of development and advancement.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties and Seeking Improvement</p>
<p>When talking about the implementation of Sichuan's educational work, the provincial government and education authorities believe that although the achievements are hard-won, they also believe that the current construction of Sichuan's education has not yet reached the ideal state. As the head of the education authority, Mr. Liu deeply sighed that there are still many thorns and difficulties on the road to fully achieving the ideal education in Sichuan. According to the discussion, the biggest difficulties in promoting Sichuan's education at present are: first, insufficient funding, and second, unhealthy social atmosphere. Regarding the issue of funding, the current financial situation in Sichuan is generally difficult. This year, the province's budget revenue and expenditure shortfall is 11.9 billion, while the total revenue of Sichuan's budget in 1947 is only 9.7 billion, and the expenditure will reach 34.7 billion, a difference of 25 billion. In such a struggling financial environment, education funding is like pouring a cup of water on a cartload of firewood, and it is difficult to talk about expansion. Regarding the issue of the social atmosphere, Sichuan's past education was not of good quality. During the war, higher education was actively rectified, but secondary education and below, under the special social environment of Sichuan during the War of Resistance, unhealthy social trends entered the schools. Teachers' lives were difficult, and the methods of management and teaching were inadequate. As a result, some students were influenced by society and infected by the environment, and their behavior was inevitably dissolute. Some were undisciplined, and others violated the law. At present, it is quite difficult to reverse this accumulated situation. For example, several bloodshed incidents occurred in Chengdu this week, and middle school students accounted for two of them. One was a student stabbing another student due to a dispute between the old and new principals of the private Chengcheng Middle School, and the other was a student at West China Middle School shooting a classmate. The general public believes that the current school atmosphere in Sichuan's middle schools has reached an extreme point. Mr. Liu believes that this is the biggest hidden worry for Sichuan's education at present. Therefore, the main work of the Sichuan Provincial Education Bureau at present is to focus on these two difficult problems and strive for solutions and improvements. How to solve the difficulties and improve the shortcomings, Mr. Liu talked about the two major active tasks of the current education authorities: first, to find ways to increase funding, and second, to thoroughly improve the social atmosphere:</p>
<p>Regarding the former, in order to cooperate with Sichuan's educational construction plan, such as expanding higher education, enriching secondary education, and popularizing social and national education, the higher education part is requesting the central government to provide as much subsidies as possible. The remaining part, within the financial capacity of the province, is requesting the provincial government to increase funding as much as possible. In addition, it is also advocating schools to create property and strive to increase revenue and reduce expenditure.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, Mr. Liu revealed the five major guidelines for educational work as soon as he took office in March of this year: (1) Democratization, (2) Disciplinarization, (3) Integrity, (4) Scientification, (5) Labor Productionization, that is, (1) adopting a democratic style of running schools, making everything open internally and externally, and fostering a spirit of mutual trust and love between teachers and students. (2) Teachers abide by the teacher's ethics, and students strictly abide by discipline, cultivating a habit of mutual respect and self-love. (3) Those who handle education work should be absolutely honest and the finances should be absolutely open, in order to set an example and be a model for society. (4) Education should adapt to needs to cultivate scientific talents, encourage students to pay attention to and society to value science, and promote the use of scientific methods in scholarship and management. (5) Encourage students to participate in labor and engage in production, so that they can become self-reliant through their own efforts. The purpose of these five points is to cultivate the ability of all students in Sichuan to have self-study, self-reliance, self-governance, and self-love. For several months, the Department of Education has used these five points as the educational guidelines and promoted them in all major middle schools in Sichuan, with remarkable results. Mr. Liu believes that if the essence of the five points can be thoroughly implemented, the school's academic atmosphere will naturally improve, and the educational atmosphere will naturally change. And he firmly stated that the removal of the first difficulty is in the hands of the central government and the provincial government, and the improvement of the second shortcoming is the unshirkable responsibility of the Department of Education. The former must be strived for, and the latter must be determined to be thoroughly completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Grasping the Guidelines and Cultivating Talents</p>
<p>Finally, when talking about the future development direction and plan of Sichuan's education, Mr. Liu believed that according to his own opinion, after the National Assembly, the national constitution was completed, and the work of nation-building began. The national construction policy should implement three major policies under the highest principle of the Three People's Principles: (1) Political Democratization, (2) Economic Socialization, (3) Cultural Education Scientification. The national government has returned to the capital, and the central government has clearly designated Sichuan as a construction experimental zone. When President Chiang bid farewell to all the elders in Sichuan, he repeatedly stated that the funding and talents for Sichuan's construction in the future will be the first in the country. The central direction of Sichuan's education in the future should be to respect the President's intentions, cooperate with practical needs, and aim to cultivate construction talents for the new Sichuan. The main directions of education in the future should be two points: (1) Enriching and expanding higher education: The purpose is to cultivate high-level talents for Sichuan's construction. The provincial government has formulated a plan to prepare to add five provincial universities in western Sichuan, central Sichuan, northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan, and in line with the needs of the main industries and special production talents in Sichuan's construction, add vocational schools in each of the sixteen administrative regions. (2) Popularizing secondary, social, and national education: The purpose is to reserve cadre talents for Sichuan's construction. According to the current statistics in Sichuan, the total population is 47,547,120 people, the number of uneducated adults is 6,740,217 people, the number of enrolled people is 2,793,184 people, and the number of illiterate people is more than 6 million, which is a great obstacle to national construction. In the future, Sichuan's new education should focus on popularizing education below the secondary level, rescuing uneducated illiterates, and massively reserving basic cadres for construction. The main purpose of the two major directions is to complete the scientification of Sichuan's education. This is the characteristic of the new education for building a new Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Opium Addiction: Must Be Stopped Quickly and Severely <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— By Cha Liangjian</p>
<p>Sichuan was the leading province in the War of Resistance, striving for national victory, and is now a model area for national construction. Sichuan's education has undergone more than 30 years of arduous management, from enlightenment to prosperity to the current period of development. After a long and frank conversation with a senior senator and veteran educator in Sichuan, from his firm belief, I believe that he will be able to overcome all difficulties, promote existing achievements, and fulfill the great mission of building a new Sichuan by building Sichuan's education.</p>
<p>The scourge of opium addiction is extremely tragic. As Lin Wen-zhong (Commissioner Lin) once lamented, everyone knows, and there is no need to repeat it. The state, in order to eradicate this poison as soon as possible, does not hesitate to use severe punishments to prohibit it, with the intention of stopping it by force, so that there will be no need for punishment in the end, and to advance our entire nation to a state of prosperity and happiness as soon as possible. This is very obvious.</p>
<p>Today, although the laws are strict and the orders are solemn, those who commit crimes in the corner of Shanghai are still commonly seen. This is because they have been trapped by the enemy for a long time, forced by the enemy and puppet's threats and inducements, and spread the poison far and wide. And the ignorant opium addicts, indulging in it without realizing it, disregard the state's intention to prohibit opium addiction, secretly smoke it, and mutually follow the old ways, avoiding forced rehabilitation. This is the main reason why complete prohibition has not yet been achieved. Now, the victory has been more than a year and four months, and there is no room for delay in clearing away the filth. It is necessary to quickly and severely prohibit opium addiction, in order to live up to the state's hope of clearing it away as soon as possible.</p>
<p>From April of this year to the present, the Shanghai District Court has accepted more than 1,500 opium addiction cases. Except for those who are indeed not addicted, all have been sentenced to criminal penalties, without any leniency. This can be said to be a serious and powerful demonstration. It is hoped that the voters will take this as a warning and extricate themselves from it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Article 13 of the Measures for Clearing Opium Addiction in Recovered Areas, after the expiration of the rehabilitation period, those who have not been cured of their addiction after inspection and verification will be punished as recidivists according to the law. In addition, Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes of Prohibiting Opium and Drugs stipulates that those who inject morphine or use opium drugs, after being ordered to abstain and quit, and then inject or use them again, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. As for those who manufacture, cultivate, transport, sell, and provide drugs for others to use, they are even more unforgivable by the law, and there are only death penalty and life imprisonment. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the imprisoned cannot be released. Who is without knowledge, and why would they be so obsessed with opium addiction as to willingly lose their lives and ruin their families? Surely it is not out of self-deception. As for those who make profits from drugs, their hearts are punishable and cannot be forgiven. We must know that the state has made a great determination to prohibit opium addiction, and is seeking to implement it quickly. All those who were already addicted in the past are expected to deeply reflect, abstain from addiction, and repent of their past mistakes. Those who are not addicted at all are expected not to try it lightly, and even more not to make profits from drugs, violating the law and receiving severe punishment.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Clearing Opium Addiction has decided to implement a general inspection of drug use from January 1st next year, and promote it with propaganda and guidance. Its intention is to clear away and prohibit it, and wash away the filth. After this, there will be no hope for further leniency. The end of the year is approaching, and time waits for no one. It is hoped that the bright punishments will be revered, and that they will awaken in time, so that they can advance together to prosperity and happiness, and ascend to the spring platform. This would be a great blessing!</p>

<h3 id="e164">A Perspective on Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Crisis <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Qijing</p>
<p>The heart of China's economy, along with victory, has triumphantly returned to Shanghai. Shanghai was originally the most prosperous and earliest international commercial center in China. Shanghai is also the largest and most modernized industrial and commercial economic region in China.</p>
<p>Due to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the abolition of unequal treaties, the recovery of concessions, the revocation of consular jurisdiction, and the autonomy of tariffs, this brand new Greater Shanghai should naturally become the nerve center of our China's construction of an industrialized modern country after victory. We did indeed harbor boundless enthusiasm, longing for this beautiful prospect!</p>
<p>More than a year has passed since the victory, and the National Government has long since completed its return to the capital. However, our inspection of Shanghai has shattered our ideals, leaving us with almost nothing but a bizarre dream!</p>
<p>The current industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai can be summed up in one sentence: it is not a scene of revival, but a crisis of great proportions. The crisis lies in high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and high taxes. Under these heavy pressures, amidst various difficulties in capital, raw materials, production and sales, transportation, and the dumping of foreign goods, Shanghai's industrial and commercial sector is now in a situation akin to being "piled with firewood on a fire." Once a financial storm arrives, Shanghai's industry and commerce will likely be unable to avoid an unprecedented panic.</p>
<p>We should not regard Shanghai's industrial and commercial market as merely one aspect of China's economy, but should recognize that Shanghai's industry and commerce are the pivot of the entire Chinese economy. Therefore, if Shanghai's industry and commerce continue to decline, it will inevitably gradually lead to a day when the Chinese economy is on the verge of total collapse!</p>
<p>"Hiding an illness and avoiding treatment" will only worsen the condition; preventing decline is also limited to passive treatment. We try to review the financial and economic measures since the victory and feel a multitude of emotions.</p>
<p>Pressuring Shanghai's industry and commerce are high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and high tax rates; presented to Shanghai's industry and commerce are lack of funds, difficulty in obtaining raw materials, dumping of foreign goods, and a narrow market.</p>
<p>The various difficulties of industry and commerce mentioned above are inevitable facts in a post-war country with declining industries. The main factor is the difficulty of wartime and post-war finances, which affects the problem of post-war currency and financial reorganization. For example, countries such as England, Germany, Japan, and Russia after the First World War all experienced industrial decline. However, the question is whether the government has countermeasures to revitalize industry. Let us look at the United States after this war: economic recovery can be described as rapid, and industrial revitalization is also very fast. Let us also look at the United Kingdom after this war, which was also able to quickly complete economic recovery amidst great trauma and deep pain. The fact that the British trade delegation to China has come to the East with joy this time is even more evident of the rapid progress of British industrial revitalization and the determination to catch up with the development of British trade in the Far East. Let us look even more at the Soviet Union after its victory, which has already completed one year of its Fourth Five-Year Plan. Even Japan, after its defeat, has resumed production of its textile industry and is about to promote sales abroad, which is especially worthy of our vigilance. It can be seen that the fundamental issue lies in the implementation of good economic policies.</p>
<p>We believe that China's current economic crisis, that is, the biggest obstacle to Shanghai's industrial and commercial decline, lies in the near-malignant inflation and the continuous decline in currency value. The most important measure to save the current economic crisis and industrial and commercial decline is to actively stabilize the currency value.</p>
<p>In a modern economic structure, currency is the center. The rise and fall of industry must take currency as its driving force. Especially in the past 20 years, the world economy has entered the era of credit economy, and countries have implemented currency policies one after another since 1931, using inflation and deflation to regulate the industrial economy. Therefore, to save the industrial and commercial economic crisis, we should also pay attention to the use of currency policy. The success of US President Roosevelt's "New Deal" in 1931 and the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act was due to the use of inflation policies to save the falling prices at that time.</p>
<p>China has undergone eight years of long-term war, and the consumption of wartime materials is naturally huge, and the financial difficulties during the war are inevitable. Inflation is often a last resort.</p>
<p>However, since the victory, the measures of the regular economic, financial, and monetary policies have only been to deal with various aspects in curing the symptoms of post-war industrial decline and economic crisis, without a thorough plan to quickly solve the entire problem and the courage to act swiftly. As a result, the industrial and commercial crisis and the national livelihood have not only not been fundamentally cured and improved, but have worsened and are becoming increasingly serious. Today, we believe that the fiscal, financial, and economic measures of the authorities must have new initiatives.</p>
<p>The other day, a telegram came saying that in order to solve the current financial and economic difficulties, the government had specially prepared a plan to improve the current financial and economic measures and handed it over to the Executive Yuan for handling. The Executive Yuan is now distributing it to relevant ministries and commissions to discuss specific measures and proceed in an orderly manner. It is also understood that the plan is divided into three major items, the main points of which are: the first item is to assist in production loans; the second item is to use foreign debt; and the third item is to control the prices and wages of daily necessities for people's livelihood. As for its detailed implementation, it is up to the authorities to implement it. We will wait and see and do not want to add more comments here. However, the issue of production loans has already been implemented, and today's industrial and commercial circles deeply feel the difficulties and problems involved. The issue of using foreign capital is not simple and feels like a slow remedy. As for the issue of price and wage controls for daily necessities for people's livelihood, it is just a rehash of old tunes. In China, the bitter nine years of experience is enough to be a painful lesson for future price control policies!</p>
<p>However, in essence, the above three economic measures are still just about the issue of prices and currency.</p>
<p>Now, let's first examine the high interest rates, which are the main factor in the current industrial and commercial crisis in Shanghai:</p>
<p>The emergence of high interest rates is caused by malignant inflation. The exact number of legal tender issued today is kept secret. The financial authorities have not issued a formal inspection report since the second half of the 26th year. This was originally understandable during the war, but it is deeply regrettable after the war.</p>
<p>Although recently, according to the claims of the financial authorities, no legal tender was issued in June and July of this year, and the amount of legal tender issued in recent months has been extremely small. If this is the case, we want to celebrate the revitalization of industry and commerce and be happy for the improvement of people's livelihood. This was originally to effectively stop inflation and gradually improve. Unfortunately, the authorities have not published accurate and clear figures to gain the trust of the people.</p>
<p>However, prices were stable in the months before August 19. But since the Central Bank revised the foreign exchange rate to 3250 for the second time on August 19, prices have risen under its stimulus. Later, due to the surge of US dollars, gold, and Hong Kong dollars, prices became even more volatile. In the past month, due to the price increases of state-owned public utilities such as post, telecommunications, trains, tap water, and electric lights, general prices have been affected and are brewing price increases. If the price index rises again, the salaries of military, government, and education personnel will need to be adjusted urgently, especially the huge military expenditure, and the financial expenditure may continue to be increased due to rising prices. How can we guarantee that the issuance of legal tender will not increase in the future? If the issuance of legal tender increases, will it not stimulate price increases again? Looking back at the price and legal tender race since the 28th year of the Republic of China, the tired pursuit has not stopped to this day, which can be a lesson!</p>
<p>Prices rise and currency values fall. Taking the Shanghai price index in October as an example: food is 564,913.62; housing is 363,733.09; clothing is 1,012,807.86; miscellaneous items are 404,580.06. The total index is 521,855.67. (Source: Statistics published by the municipal government) And the currency value has fallen to one point, falling to 0.002. In short, if prices rise again, there will never be a day of currency stability.</p>
<p>If the currency value is unstable and the purchasing power of legal tender is weakened, the impact will be: (1) the decrease in national income; (2) the unsound national economic psychology; (3) the stagnation of national savings; (4) the increase in the national burden (inflation is an invisible burden of the common people on the country). As a result, on the one hand, idle funds are concentrated, speculation is rampant, disrupting the financial market, and making the rich richer; on the other hand, national income is decreasing due to currency devaluation, the livelihood of the common people is becoming increasingly difficult, and the poor are becoming poorer. All those who hold legal tender, because its currency value is difficult to guarantee, compete to buy gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, resulting in a strange shortage of funds on the market, and the working capital needed by industry and commerce increases with the increase in wages due to the cost of living index and the rise in raw material prices, and its number often reaches tens of millions. Because of the large amount of legal tender, high interest rates are inevitable.</p>
<p>According to the latest announcement of the Shanghai Money Trade Association, the interest rate in Shanghai is 16.5%, which is higher than in other places. Such high interest rates have become a fatal injury to Shanghai's industry and commerce!</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, Shanghai's industry and commerce have been under the pressure of high interest rates. Stores have closed down and liquidated, and factories have stopped or reduced work, most of which are in a state of semi-paralysis. In the eight, nine, and thirteen months, 80 factories, companies, and commercial firms in Shanghai officially declared liquidation or bankruptcy. Therefore, how to use what kind of policy to suppress the high interest rates in Shanghai today is a crucial issue. Recently, it was heard that the financial authorities, in view of the rampant high interest rates in various places and the great impact on the entire economy, telegraphed the Central Bank to implement a crackdown. The Audit Department of the Central Bank is now adopting a method of having the banking industry in various places negotiate interest rates and then submitting them to the Central Bank for approval. The 16.5% interest rate of the Shanghai Money Trade Association recently seems to be too high. The Audit Department has sent a letter to the industry associations of the banking and money industries, requiring them to gradually lower the interest rate in the future according to market conditions. It is also heard that the Central Bank is using financial power to gradually lower the market interest rate to below 12% as a preliminary standard. The Central Bank has also drafted measures to crack down on underground money houses and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation, which may achieve considerable results. However, the financial authorities also deeply feel that "the reasons for the creation of high interest rates are very complicated and cannot be effectively suppressed by rigid means."</p>
<p>How can high interest rates in Shanghai be eliminated today? We believe:</p>
<p>First, expand production loans. Current Shanghai industry and commerce need a lot of working capital because raw materials are expensive, wages are high, and costs are increased. High-interest loans are originally unsustainable and are forced to use them, which is tantamount to a "suicide policy." What is expected from the government is that the loans given to industry and commerce are very small, and the procedures and mortgage conditions are too harsh, making it difficult to apply, and it is felt that it is too slow to solve the urgent needs. Now that the government has prepared a plan to improve the current financial and economic measures in order to solve the current financial and economic difficulties, the total amount of loans for the 36th year is estimated to be 50 billion, and the Yuan has ordered to discuss specific measures. Regarding the transportation and sales of goods, the original Four Joint has "relaxed loan measures" and "mortgage transfer" methods. We believe that: (1) The amount of 50 billion production loans is still insufficient. With the huge need for funds for Shanghai's industry and commerce, small shops borrow tens of millions at every turn, and small factories also need hundreds of millions. How can this mere 50 billion solve the problem? It is hoped that the authorities can effectively coordinate with the production plan and give practical salvation. (2) Relaxing loans is what Shanghai's industry and commerce expect, and the convenience of goods transportation and sales is also what Shanghai's industry and commerce pray for day and night. How to simplify loan procedures and reduce loan mortgage conditions in the future must be based on the principle of facilitating industry and commerce and must not become a mere formality. (3) Expanding syndicated loans should be carried out urgently and should not be limited to salt and tea. All governance should be quick and decisive, and only then can problems be solved. This requires the efforts of the authorities.</p>
<p>Second, implement interest rate policies. The reason why today's high interest rates are caused, we believe, is that the Central Bank has not fulfilled the function of a "bank of banks," and the Four Joint Headquarters has not fulfilled its main duty to eliminate the current industrial and commercial crisis, which is a major factor. How the Central Bank strengthens its functions in the future is definitely something that the regular authorities will actively promote, and the specialization of national banks must be strengthened. The rise and fall of interest rates is originally controlled by the Central Bank's interest rate policy. The Central Bank must also plan its interest rate based on the rise and fall of industry and commerce. The crackdown measures implemented by the Central Bank on today's high interest rates, the so-called bank deposit interest rate, must not exceed the high limit of the loan interest rate, is really a joke. Which bank or money house in the world is willing to absorb deposits at high interest rates and release loans at low interest rates? This kind of interest rate management method is just deceiving children! Of course, the crux of the problem still lies in inflation. If inflation is not rectified, everything is empty talk!</p>
<p>Third, actively reorganize the currency system. In terms of the current economic situation, state-owned public utilities are leading price increases, and everything is eager to rise. If prices rise again, the government's expenses must increase, and tightening the currency is impossible. Under the decline of industry and commerce, if the national treasury wants to increase taxes in order to enrich government revenue, it is like killing the chicken to get the eggs and draining the pond to get the fish. In addition, the Sino-US Commercial Treaty has been concluded, and reciprocal trade has restricted tariff revenue. It is even more difficult to raise debts. Old debts have not been cleared, and the currency value continues to fall. How can new debts be issued? If we rely on the profit income of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, judging from the past eight or nine years of experience, it is equivalent to climbing a tree to catch fish. What is left is only the two ways of increasing the issuance of currency and selling enemy and puppet properties. If the treasury is not actively reorganized and continues to drag on like this, when will we achieve a balance of payments? We believe that actively reorganizing the currency system is the first step in reforming the treasury. We believe that only by actively reorganizing the currency system, curbing inflation, and stabilizing the currency value can the national treasury have a way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>In short, after the currency is reorganized and the currency value is stabilized, the national income will increase with the revitalization of industry, national savings will also increase sharply with the accumulation of wealth, and social finance can step into a normal path. If the purchasing power of currency is ensured, prices will also tend to stabilize. The difficulties encountered by the industrial and commercial circles today, such as high interest rates, high wages, high costs, and lack of funds, can be solved easily; the economic life of the common people today can also be improved from this.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Bird's-Eye View of Overseas Chinese Publications in France <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Ren of this newspaper, Airmail from Paris, 2nd</p>
<p>Having traveled all over the world, the publication of foreign-language newspapers in major cities is most abundant in New York and Paris. France is a land of freedom, and foreigners in Paris can easily enjoy freedom of speech. According to a recent survey, there are four types of Chinese newspapers in Paris, which are more numerous and wonderful than the overseas Chinese publications printed in Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The first type is the mouthpiece of intellectuals in the overseas Chinese community, called "Overseas Chinese Times," a Monday weekly, currently published to issue 95, straight, 48 cm high, 34 cm wide, lithographed, edited by the painter Fang Wei. The content of this newspaper is divided into sections such as important news from the motherland, international news, overseas Chinese news, reading materials for children, and readers' countries. The leading editorial, such as the recent long-term view of the US Republican Party's victory from various aspects, has unique insights. The important news specially reveals the full text of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order on November 8, and the propaganda department of the Shen Bao Da Gong Bao on the new Sino-US relationship. Although the length is not much, the content is very rich. The second type is the "San Min Dao Bao" published by the French branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, a Friday weekly, which has been published to issue 69, the whole page is folded into four sections, straight, 32 cm high, 25 cm wide, which is equal to one-fourth of the whole page of Shen Bao, lithographed, edited by Xiao Shijun from Hunan, who studied literature in France. The content of this newspaper is divided into sections such as important news from the country, international news, overseas Chinese news, and literature and art, which is more refined than the Chinese Weekly published in Liverpool, England. Xiao Jun's beautiful calligraphy is hand-copied on stone, and those who get it feel it is especially precious. People who usually help with funding for this newspaper are veteran comrades of the Kuomintang, Zhang Nan, and most of the Qingtian overseas Chinese traders who profited during the war. The newspaper does not reveal any commentary, and it is a typical publication for the overseas Chinese community.</p>
<p>The third type is called "Justice," published secretly on an irregular basis, with no office address, and mailed to readers at any time. It is unknown who wrote it. Straight, 27 cm high, 21 cm wide, mimeographed. When there is something unsatisfactory in France, this newspaper uses hints and sarcasm to express grievances. The parties involved change immediately when they hear about it. This method can prevent extreme privacy and potentially turn big things into small things, and make small things disappear, which is extremely effective in preventing disasters before they happen.</p>
<p>The fourth type is called "Voice of Peace," published by the Overseas Chinese Peace Promotion Association in France, with no partisan relationship, and dedicated to promoting peace. The editor is the scientist Meng Lingya, who usually makes many inventions in pest research and medical chemistry. This newspaper is a bi-monthly booklet, straight, 22 cm high, 18 cm wide, 18 sections (pages) in the whole book. The first half contains commentaries, mostly from Western newspapers such as the US continental edition of "Herald Forum." The aphorisms in its editorial, such as "In ancient times, it was said that a country cannot have two rulers, and today people should say that a country cannot have two armies. If a country has two armies, it will fight to the death. On the contrary, politics can only be resolved politically, and should not use force," are meaningful and can be used as a reference for those who plan the country. The second half contains international news, domestic communications, and satirical essays. In summary, what makes people optimistic about the various publications is that, firstly, there is no fire between the two political publications, so people from all walks of life in the overseas Chinese business and academic circles do not divide their boundaries but help and coordinate with each other. Secondly, the academic community calls Ambassador Qian, the resident in France, a "good old man," and the overseas Chinese community is satisfied with the ambassadors and consuls in Paris when they communicate with relatives and friends abroad. The atmosphere in the newspapers is still peaceful. It is fortunate that these four Chinese publications in Paris are not misused for meaningless disputes. The freedom of speech is considerable, and there is no accidental separation of feelings. The future of China is improving day by day, and the benefits of gathering wisdom and benefiting widely are very great for newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Standardization of Chinese Industry <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— A Declaration</p>
<p>Why has Chinese industry lagged behind for decades? This is a question that all Chinese people should ask. I dare to say that the primary reasons are a lack of standardization and a lack of organization. I will write what I know below.</p>
<p>We know that one of the most important causes of waste in industry is the excessive variety of products. The reason for the complexity of products is that buyers often require products tailored to their individual characteristics. For example, many customers like specially formatted stationery, specially designed knives, furniture tailored to their individual needs, and cars that are different from their neighbors. In addition, clothing often has many novel styles. Manufacturers, in order to cope with these ever-changing situations, have initiated a well-organized movement. This movement can not only suppress the increasing trend of product variation as much as possible, but also eliminate the waste caused by this trend in the industrial world. The basis of this movement is Simplification and Standardization.</p>
<p>Simplification and Standardization</p>
<p>——We will not discuss the economic principles of standardization, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, for the time being. Its definition can be explained as an action to transform any product into a certain form, a certain size, and a certain quality. For example, years ago, most engineers unanimously recognized that hexagonal or square shapes were the most suitable forms for the heads of iron bolts and the bases of nuts. Furthermore, they unanimously agreed that all iron bolts above a certain size should have a certain diameter. Later, they were also quite consistent on how many threads should be cut for each size of iron bolt and each volume of bolt head and nut. The only thing that was not specified was the length of the iron bolt, but there were certain regulations for small and short ones. Later, the Society of Automobile Engineers further strictly regulated all the elements of the steel base for manufacturing automobile iron bolts, so the form, size, and quality of all iron bolts were completely specified. However, commercial standardization was still largely limited to large-scale engineering organizations or scientific organizations before the war.</p>
<p>After the United States joined the war, the Conservation Division of The War Industries Board began a very active movement to reduce the variety of all manufactured goods, in order to free up most of the labor, capital, raw materials, and tools for military purposes. The achievements of this department in this work were very impressive. This article will not go into details, but it is worthwhile for readers to study it. This work is now being continued by the Division of Simplified Practice of the Department of Commerce, and its achievements have also made great progress. Generally, their method of carrying out this movement is to first carefully study the problem, and then convene representatives of various manufacturers, sellers, and buyers to discuss it at length, in order to obtain their consent to reduce the number of forms. As a result, they reduced the number of paving tiles from sixty-six forms to fifty-five.</p>
<p>The term "simplification" is used to refer to this movement to reduce the number of product forms. Many modern authors believe that this term should be completely separated from standardization. In fact, this argument is unreasonable. For example, according to the history of iron bolt standardization described above, when all other forms of heads and nuts except hexagonal and square shapes are abandoned, those remaining forms are naturally the standard forms. If all iron bolts other than the several common sizes of iron bolts are abandoned, those remaining iron bolts are naturally also standard iron bolts.</p>
<p>In addition, we cannot say that standardization and simplification are different because true standardization must be based on scientific principles. It is true that redundant forms can often be eliminated without using scientific methods, but it is often unreliable to generalize in this way.</p>
<p>The Organization of Standardization</p>
<p>Modern organizations engaged in standardization work can be conveniently divided into four types: international, national, industrial, and factory standardization organizations. The so-called standards for the work of international organizations are of course basic in nature and have universal uses. Examples include units of electrical resistance, units of electrical power, seconds, minutes, meters, and so on. In addition, the standard gauge used on railways also belongs to the international category.</p>
<p>In the United States, most of the work on developing and approving basic scientific standards relies on the United States Bureau of Standards. For example, the Hoke Standard Gages of Length, which are accurate to one millionth of an inch, are specified by the Bureau. As for the standards used in industry and engineering, they are generally formulated by many engineering organizations and specialized technical organizations. For example, the Boiler Code issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers has become the standard for all boiler manufacturing in the country, and even some states have made it into law. In addition, in order to avoid duplication of work and to achieve large-scale cooperation, thirty-three of the most important specialized technical organizations in the country have also formed an American Engineering Standards Committee by sending representatives. The actual work of approving standards is still presided over by the various departments to which they should belong, while the discussions and comparisons are resolved by the entire committee. This is undoubtedly the most powerful organization currently engaged in standardization work, and it may have a great impact on international standardization work in the future.</p>
<p>The Standardization of Form and Size</p>
<p>As far as the current situation is concerned, it is probably not possible to make the movement to simplify the form and size of manufactured goods prevalent in all industries in a very short period of time; and it is also not easy for most manufacturers to solve the problem of selecting the best forms and the most convenient sizes. One of the reasons for this situation is that the standardization of these things often contains some empirical colors, which cannot be solved by mathematical methods. For example, if a manufacturer wants to manufacture steam engines of a certain size and a certain energy, or boots and shoes of a certain length and width, he must deduce a conclusion based on the Law of Average in order to make the form and size of the products meet the greatest need.</p>
<p>However, it is very obvious that the standards determined in this way always have an arbitrary color, and in fact there is plenty of room for selection. For example, there is no particular advantage to why the standard ruler of length is so long. If it had been set longer or shorter at the beginning, its function would still be the same. In addition, the forms and sizes of collars, coats, shoes, and many other manufactured goods are also arbitrarily determined. This standard can only roughly solve some of the problems of meeting needs within a certain range of indefinite needs; in fact, the scope represented by this standard is still covered by larger and smaller standards. Therefore, the procedures for specifying standards for transactions or exchanges are generally of an arbitrary nature. If we want to accurately set one or two forms and sizes of standards for the convenience of manufacturing, it is really necessary to have a very clear understanding of this part of the industry.</p>
<p>Standards of Excellence——We must note that once the form or size of an item has been standardized, there can be several standards of excellence at the same time. Moreover, it is not necessary to find the highest standard of excellence among all types. For example, shoes of a certain model and size can be produced in several different qualities at the same time to meet the needs of people of all levels. To talk about some more valuable products, such as cameras, if only the best kind is manufactured, then the number of people who can enjoy this kind of thing will inevitably be very few. So it is very necessary that if an item of the highest quality is manufactured, it can also be made into a product of the same form and size, although its standard of excellence is slightly lower. However, no matter whether the standard of excellence is high or low, once it is specified, all products must absolutely conform to these standards, which is also very important.</p>
<p>Engineering Standards</p>
<p>The engineering department must determine the standard forms and sizes of most products, and must specify the styles and dimensions of all parts of standard machinery. In addition, if the interchangeability of products is required, the engineering department must also determine the size and form of all parts, so that the purpose of exchange can proceed without hindrance. As for the work of the department itself, it should of course also be standardized. Therefore, all material requisition forms must have standard sizes, all technical guidance documents must have standard forms, standard methods of material lettering and ordering must be implemented, and standard symbols for all drawings and machine parts must be adopted. These standard methods not only make the office work organized, but also can generate the highest efficiency.</p>
<p>Standard Materials——A standard classification method is very important for the needs of incoming goods. However, the benefits and economics of material standardization are known to few people. In many factories, the quality of the materials used is entirely determined by the inventory director or foreman. This method may be sufficient in very small factories or factories that specialize in repair work. But in any case, a job must be able to use the appropriate materials in all parts, and then it can get better products and lower costs. This certainly does not mean that the best materials should be used for any part, but it does mean that if a certain quality of material has been selected for a certain purpose, then one must always be careful that the material used is not wrong.</p>
<p>Reducing the differences in the form and size of various materials can often save huge amounts of money, so after material standardization, the danger of special materials accumulating in piles in the warehouse and depreciating and holding large amounts of capital can be greatly reduced. This benefit is the same for the standardization of supplies. In short, these things must be carefully studied for the purpose of use before they can be purchased.</p>
<p>Standard Quantities</p>
<p>Carefully specifying the quantity of materials used can also generate huge economies. Under repair work, the economy of using materials often becomes a matter of personal prudence, but when the same work has to be repeated continuously, special attention must be paid to the quantity of materials, and the list of materials must have a certain standard, so that it can be used as the basis for incoming goods and as the basis for distributing materials to the warehouse at the same time. Also, whether the list of materials is made by the engineering department or by the production clerk, it should be stored in the archives for future reference.</p>
<p>Standardizing the quantity of supplies is also an economical means. In large factories, those supplies, such as waste materials for washing machines, oil, and brooms, can be distributed using a budget system, and each person receives the quantity necessary for their job once in each period. In addition, it is also easy to standardize the amount of coal required per horsepower, or the amount of coal gas chemicals or other materials used in various industrial processes. If these standard quantities sometimes need to be exceeded, then these additional increases must be explained with adequate reasons.</p>

<p>Wool fabrics that are treated in a neutral hot formaldehyde solution for a long period of time can absorb formaldehyde and reduce shrinkage, but still shrink extremely severely after several washes!</p>
<p>The new method involves placing the wool fabric in a formaldehyde and acid solution, and continuing to heat it to promote complete action; then washing and drying it. Wool fabrics treated by this method do not lose their shrink-proof properties even after prolonged washing, and can also increase strength, wrinkle resistance, dyeability, and alkali resistance. Dyes can also be added to the treatment solution for dyeing at the same time, or the wool fabric can be printed with anti-dyeing substances first, and then treated in a formaldehyde acid and dye solution, which can also produce patterns.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Will Brahman Cattle Help China? A New Proposal for Chinese Agriculture? <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhong Deqi</p>
<p>Our country's livestock is mostly draught animals, and the number is extremely small, which is one of the characteristics of our agricultural economy. It has a great impact on farmers' income. This article is a suggestion aimed at this problem, and at the same time proposes an economic rotation system for Chinese agriculture. The author of this article, D. Week, is a famous American agricultural expert. He came to China to lecture in the 20th year of the Republic of China. He is very concerned about Chinese agricultural issues. Translator's note.</p>
<p>China's land use is very intensive and also very extensive. In the central parts of China, there are some grasslands and shrub hills, which sometimes do not necessarily have to be used exclusively for fuel production as they are now. Cotton fields have been expanded in the areas of China suitable for their growth. But cotton is a Soil-deplecing Crop. However, cotton seeds have already become the main source of livestock feed.</p>
<p>In central Brazil, cotton and Zebu or Brahman cattle are very useful in agriculture.</p>
<p>From an agricultural and animal husbandry perspective, Brazil's cattle production problems are similar to those in central China. Diseases and parasites have made those who have tried to extend the beneficial production of Shorthorns, Herefords, and Angus cattle from the Argentine plains all the way to the subtropical zones of south-central Brazil (translator's note: all three of the above are beef breeds. The first two are produced in the United Kingdom, the Shorthorn is named for its short horns, and the Hereford is named after its place of origin. The Angus is originally from Angus Aberdeen-shireAngus in northeastern Scotland, hence the name) suffer economic misfortune. Zebu cattle are resistant to tumors, parasites, and even insects. They originated in India and thrive in hot climates.</p>
<p>Initially, Brazilian livestock farmers tried using "Hereford" and other recognized cattle breeds for crossbreeding, which has been successfully tested in Taxes, USA. But in Brazil, the characteristics of Zebu cattle have a superior trend, and their hybrids with local livestock become very similar to the humped characteristics of Zebu cattle. The current trend is to breed the characteristics of Zebu cattle, propagate good cattle shapes and light colors. Pests attack black cattle, but light-colored cattle are easier to avoid.</p>
<p>Merchants who initially discriminated against the color of Zebu cattle now also feel that they are the savior of the Brazilian beef industry. The latter part has been allowed to pay the same price in the high-quality beef export market, and the first half and the hump are packed in cans or dried.</p>
<p>Far away in central Brazil, the development and prosperity of the land is in progress, and the farm programming plan is cotton Coloniao and cattle. Coloniao is the Brazilian word for Guinea geiass - (Panicum Maximum). (Translator's note: The scientific name of Guinea grass is (PanicumMaximum), which is a kind of perennial herb of the millet genus of the grass family, produced in the tropics and up to 4-10 feet, for fodder). Cattle refers to Zebu cattle and hybrids with local and other species. Guinea grass is grazed four years after cotton is planted. It used to be planted in cotton trunks like an opening crop. These crops complement each other to provide nutritious feed for cattle. These cultivated pastures protect soil erosion and retain fertility after tired cultivated cotton. In frost-free years, the pastures are all as tall as cattle across the acre.</p>
<p>By developing transportation, by replacing fuel with oil or electricity, and by introducing economic fermentation elements to replace the burning of grass and branches in old stoves, wouldn't China benefit from the same crop rotation? In some places, aren't these plans impossible to fully prove successful today? Isn't this question worth putting into their research by livestock agronomy and farm management experts?</p>

<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>How can this be considered the first day of the new year? The sky is heavily pressing down, and if it weren't for those few mountain peaks supporting it, it would surely collapse straight onto the ground. Snow fills the pits and valleys, and the white snow and the gray-spotted sky are in contrast. Crows fly around in flocks and scream, as if a catastrophe is coming, or as if they want to break the gray solitude. Most of the bamboo on the mountain has fallen to the ground, or at least formed a ring. Thorns still show their hideous faces, piercing through the white snow. In the valley, everything is confused and seems to be filled with demonic fog. People's hearts are also as heavy as lead. Naturally, on the first day of the new year, such bad weather would make anyone unhappy, and the news that the New Fourth Army is only ten miles away from here makes people even more uneasy. New Year greetings and gambling have all been thrown to the winds. The enemy, coming to this poor place, is at most a stray, and one can hide on the mountain and be done with it. The New Fourth Army is different, liquidation, donations, although there are no rich households in the village, they still have enough to eat. The apportionment is heavy, but it won't be as bad as taking half of the property. Even the homeless young man who does odd jobs for people is uneasy, because he is afraid of being drafted into the army. Doing odd jobs still gets him food, wine, and lodging, but if the New Fourth Army comes, no one will dare to hire odd jobs, what will he do?</p>
<p>Xiao Li works in the county government of the old central government. In fact, if it weren't for the war of resistance, he would definitely be a handsome college student. After graduating from high school, he couldn't swallow being enslaved by the enemy, and would rather risk drilling through the cracks between the enemy and the puppets to work. He treats people very well, and everyone says that Xiao Li is an honest official. — In fact, he is just an accounting assistant in the county government. The township chief also said: "Among the people in the county government, I only admire Mr. Xiao Li."</p>
<p>"Mr. Xiao Li, please step aside, the New Fourth Army will kill you if they see someone from the old central government!" Old Baochang Yang took his dry tobacco pipe and tobacco pouch and said this to Xiao Li. Yes, he should step aside, but many account books and receipts have not been taken away. The general affairs master had already escorted the county magistrate's luggage away, and the loss of the account books would be beneficial to the county magistrate anyway. In addition, the other departments are drafting laborers, and Director Guo of the accounting office is in the provincial government, so the burden falls on him. The Baochang said that all the laborers in the village have been drafted away, what should he do?</p>
<p>So he had to call two children to move the official documents and hide them in a thatched hut in the mountains. Xiao Li was originally wearing plain clothes, but now he stuffed all his documents and pens under the snow. No one would have the guts to take responsibility for putting them in the house, and if they were found, they would be "confiscated".</p>
<p>"Pounce—" The wooden shell gun sounded, very close.</p>
<p>"Da da da..." A light machine gun, "Pat, pat—squeak—" A bullet flew past the side of the house, and the old Baochang told Xiao Li to leave quickly. Xiao Li had no choice but to walk along the mountain path behind the house. After passing three or four houses, he was immediately discovered by two people in gray uniforms crawling and walking quickly.</p>
<p>"Stop—" they shouted, their guns pointing at him, so scary, one fired a shot and ten bullets flew past Xiao Li's side, shouting sharply and urgently.</p>
<p>"Come here, raise your hands, come from the field, hurry up, damn it, hurry up!" Xiao Li obediently walked into the field, the snow water splashed on his thighs, soaking through the tubing, and the mud submerged his ankles.</p>
<p>After a search, there were still 2,000 yuan of legal tender in his bag, and a ring that had just been taken off his finger was hidden in their bag. A soldier pulled on the wool shirt on his body.</p>
<p>"You are not a good thing, the Three Youth League! Where did the old central government go? Tell the truth!"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I'm doing business." Xiao Li had no choice but to say this.</p>
<p>"Damn it, still lying!" "Pat!" A crisp slap.</p>
<p>"Don't say much, take it to the battalion headquarters!" Another</p>
<p>When he saw the battalion commander, several soldiers were "searching" and shooting sporadically. The instructor was trying to stop it, but it didn't work. The instructor was probably wearing too few clothes, and he would shudder every time a gunshot sounded. The soldiers wore long cotton uniforms, thick leggings, hats with ear flaps, no cap badges, sophisticated bullet belts, and long and short rifles, Zhongzheng style, Type 77, Han-made, sleeve, Type 38... almost an exhibition could be held.</p>
<p>"You look like you have knowledge," the battalion commander finally admitted that he was a businessman, because this was proven by the other old people who had been captured, "Why are you still staying with the old central government? They are already stubborn old guys, what's there to miss? Haha, our New Fourth Army is the real revolutionary army, who doesn't say we're good? Wherever we go, the people there are liberated, you are also a young man, you can follow us in the revolution, have food and clothing, what are you afraid of? Don't hesitate, there is no way out of the mountain."</p>
<p>Xiao Li lowered his head. Excessive fear, and the cruelty of the enemy and puppets, the hard work of escaping from the devil's cave, the expectations of his parents, his own future, the admonition of his fiancée... these titles and thoughts surged in his mind like a tide.</p>
<p>"Don't fight, a bullet has to kill an enemy!" The instructor crossed his hands and shouted loudly, and the hand holding the gun was also hidden in his arms. The gunfire still didn't stop, "Pat—" the instructor shivered, "Pat—" another shiver.</p>
<p>He was taken to D Village, and met Zhao, the editor of the ×× newspaper. They exchanged silent glances, and didn't dare to greet each other. There was also an old central government straggler with diarrhea, who was either having diarrhea or groaning with his stomach. The soldiers took the meat, fish, New Year cakes, chicken, and eggs that they had taken, and cooked a large pot, which everyone divided and ate. The prisoners also got some, but the things they were holding were the bowls in the village store that were used to hold chili sauce, which made them cry.</p>
<p>Xiao Li was sick. His body was wet and he caught a cold. He didn't sleep well at night. Three people shared a broken blanket with mildew, which was simply frozen hard. A bonfire was lit in the middle of the house, but the house was like a cool pavilion. Getting closer was like baking bread, and walking away would make you shiver. Of course, you wouldn't get close to the fire when you slept. As a result, his throat was hoarse, his nose was stuffed, and emotions such as fear, anxiety, and disappointment were twisting his heart. His appetite was gone, and his head was heavy and his feet were light and he was about to fall. Sitting or standing would make him see stars in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>The troops had to leave again, and there was a burst of chaos, busy looking for laborers to transport the "trophies", and the soldiers also had to sort out their "foreign wealth". Finally, the team was assembled on a snow-covered exercise field, and the battalion commander put on "new clothes" and looked very energetic.</p>
<p>Xiao Li stood there in a daze, unable to say what he felt. Suddenly, the battalion commander called him and the straggler with diarrhea out. He was even more at a loss and didn't know where he was going.</p>
<p>The battalion commander looked them up and down and said:</p>
<p>"Well, your bodies are in such bad shape, I don't need you. Go back for now, and come back when you're better, but be careful! Without the permission of the New Fourth Army, you must never take a step out of the liberated area, otherwise—hum, the discipline of our liberated area is strict! I'll treat you as reactionaries, businessmen do business, farmers farm, you must never rebel against the Communist Party! Do you understand?"</p>
<p>Xiao Li nodded blankly.</p>
<p>"Okay, go!" The battalion commander waved his hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Li vaguely walked out of their team, and climbed back to H Ridge in a dreamlike state. Looking back at D Village, on the ground dyed into a pure white world by snow, some gray people were moving.</p>
<p>"Liberated," he subconsciously touched his empty bag, and dragged his heavy steps down the ridge. In the valley, only the residual snow on the bamboo falling on the ground made an empty whisper.</p>
<h3 id="e171">In Commemoration of Beethoven's Birthday <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>On this day in 1770 (December 16th), a passionate genius was born on the banks of the Rhine River—the musician Beethoven.</p>
<p>Beethoven's biography and historical achievements are known to the world. I do not wish to reprint his life and works. I only wish to express my deep respect with a superficial view.</p>
<p>Beethoven is admirable not only because of the appeal of his works, but also because he devoted all his wisdom and energy, one hundred percent, to the art of music, which was superior to his own life. He remained unmarried throughout his life, and became deaf in middle age due to overwork. Even after losing his hearing, which was a fatal blow to his music, he continued to dedicate his remaining life and talent to diligent creation, and even in his will, he shouted out the unfinished notes. This spirit of fighting against fate and betting everything for art is rare in the history of music. In contrast to other musicians, in Beethoven's brief history, there are very few "romance" stories. Although "Moonlight Sonata" is clearly dedicated to someone as a "Fantasy Sonata," there is no follow-up. He was once engaged to the sister of a certain Count, but the marriage did not happen. After his death, a love letter was found in Beethoven's secret drawer, written in his own hand, with concise but heartfelt words, but without the name of the recipient, and it is unknown to whom it referred. In short, almost all of his energy and effort were spent on the keyboard and musical notes, with very little distraction for romantic love. Yes, this made him eccentric and irritable (for example, he liked to play with water, and if the audience talked during his performance, he would not hesitate to stop playing). However, this abnormal manifestation of his spirit precisely demonstrates that his entire soul was melted into one thing (music). His main works include only nine symphonies, one opera... and thirty-two piano sonatas. He did not seek quantity, but quality. He knew well that "prolific output inevitably leads to fewer masterpieces."</p>
<p>His greatest masterpiece is the Ninth Symphony, also known as the "Choral Symphony" because it exceptionally incorporates a choral part, making it a prominent work among symphonies.</p>
<p>I often feel that Beethoven's religious colors allow his works to be contained within a deep and broad scope. Listen to his Pastoral Symphony (Sixth), which implies: the gurgling of high mountains and flowing water, the warbling of birds in the forest, the shepherd playing the flute, the farmers singing in harmony... all the love and pleasure that nature gives to mankind are truly indescribable.</p>
<p>Although Beethoven lived to be fifty-seven, his works are far fewer than those of most musicians.</p>
<p>Thinking of the musician Beethoven is like hearing his "Pastoral Symphony," the soul rushing from the secular circle to the greatness of nature!</p>

<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>The group of children is coming.</p>
<p>The group of children,</p>
<p>Singing songs joyfully, is coming.</p>
<p>All the pedestrians are encouraged by this singing.</p>
<p>All the workers turn to this singing,</p>
<p>And with the most natural joy,</p>
<p>Look at this group of children.</p>
<p>And the children sing even more unrestrainedly.</p>
<p>Children do not know sorrow,</p>
<p>And all those who listen to this singing forget sorrow.</p>
<p>And those who jump out from the doors,</p>
<p>Run over from the roadside, covered with</p>
<p>Various masks of life,</p>
<p>Also forgetfully greet and sing along.</p>
<p>This world,</p>
<p>Is a children's world!</p>
<p>A world of love, a world of innocence!</p>
<p>This singing,</p>
<p>Causes withered flowers and plants to sprout new buds,</p>
<p>Causes withered branches to grow tender leaves,</p>
<p>Causes hibernating pupae to wriggle,</p>
<p>Causes cattle and sheep in the wild to prick up their ears,</p>
<p>Causes the faces of old people to radiate the smiles of youth,</p>
<p>Causes the hearts of young people to harmonize with songs of happiness,</p>
<p>Causes wandering breezes to become more naughty and lively,</p>
<p>Causes the sunshine to become more affectionate and warm,</p>
<p>Causes dead love to revive,</p>
<p>And makes the earth return to spring.</p>
<p>This is life!</p>
<p>This is the continuation of mankind,</p>
<p>The continuous generation of living things!</p>
<p>But the child driving the horse cannot sing!</p>
<p>He seems sick,</p>
<p>As if completely numbed by the painful life;</p>
<p>The colt pulling the cart cannot sing either,</p>
<p>It seems overly hungry and overly tired.</p>
<p>But the child driving the horse,</p>
<p>Still has to shout at it and whip it—</p>
<p>This is the whip of life!</p>
<p>Can he still listen to this singing?</p>
<p>Can it still savor this singing?</p>
<p>Although he is mixed in the singing,</p>
<p>He is carrying the singing, dragging the singing.</p>
<p>This world still has many imperfections!</p>
<p>This joyful singing still hides sobbing!</p>
<p>This mankind still needs greater fairness and harmony!</p>
<p>(December 2, 35th year, in Kunming)</p>

<p>— Liu Xucang</p>
<h3 id="e174">Who Exactly Deceived You? <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Yuan</p>
<p>It's almost midnight. There is boundless silence in the courtyard. Occasionally, one or two vendors run in and shout in hoarse voices: "Fried rice candy, boiled water, salted tea eggs..." These intermittent cries, like the groans of a patient, are truly annoying. They replace the noisy clamor of the children in the courtyard during the day, embellish the silence of the night, and break through this quiet surrounding. The cold moon slants to the west, and the night deepens, bringing me an inexplicable melancholy. The Catholic Church in the distance sends a burst of clear, serene, and mournful chimes.</p>
<p>A memory unconsciously floats to my mind.</p>
<p>It was almost four years ago. On the banks of the Jialing River, due to common interests, we got to know each other at a literary discussion meeting. In the short span of two months, we went from strangers to bosom friends. A friendship formed by chance gradually turned into regret for not meeting sooner. Different ages, two hometowns tens of thousands of miles apart, we forged a bond of intimate friendship. We played together, read books together, and talked together. His wisdom, insights, and knowledge gave me great inspiration, and I have respected him ever since. Whenever the sun set in the west and dusk approached, he stood on a small hill, expressing endless emotion to the clouds floating northeast in the sky, and often reminisced about his lost hometown—the White Mountains and Black Waters. Discord in his family created his solitary and quiet nature. He often resonated with anger and hatred towards the rampancy of the enemy and the daily decline of national affairs. It was his love for his motherland and his hometown that later enabled him to embark on the expedition, fighting far away in India and Burma and burying his body in a foreign land.</p>
<p>One winter night, with heavy rain and piercing snow, he and several of his fellow students who were enlisting went to the training regiment headquarters. He came to say goodbye to me. At that time, his flushed face could not help but bring tears to my eyes, and I could not say a word. At the moment of parting, I could only hold his chapped hand tightly. He was only wearing a few thin clothes that were not enough to keep him warm, and his feet were red with cold from wearing straw sandals. I was really worried that he would catch a cold at that time. But he replied, "What does it matter for the country?"</p>
<p>Later, he sent me a letter from India. Life in the army was not as ideal as he had imagined. The darkness, tyranny, and unreasonable "hillbilly" habits suffocated the spirit of many intellectuals. Bureaucratic style destroyed the iron will of the young people. Many sensitive comrades committed suicide out of worry and indignation. But for the sake of the country's survival and the nation's safety, he never complained once. He worked hard and diligently, saying, "Kill one more enemy, spend one less bullet." This was his spiritual comfort. The torrent of the Irrawaddy River washed him so strongly, and the peaks of the Savage Mountains enabled him to overcome the harsh environment. He often wrote in his letters, "Life as a soldier is the real battle of life."</p>
<p>He had been wounded twice, and finally died unfortunately in the mop-up campaign in northern Burma. When the news of his death reached me, I looked westward and watched the fall of this giant star in the sky. The torrent of the Irrawaddy River finally led him to the final destination of truth. The title of "died for the country" is forever hung in the souls of the soldiers.</p>
<p>We can be said to have gained victory, or it can be said to be lucky. Did I deceive him? Writing this, I can't help but think of Lu You's poem, "I knew from the beginning that all things are empty when dead, but I grieve that I cannot see the unification of Kyushu." I think he may have felt the same way!</p>
<p>Friend, your hopes have also received the final answer. Won't you be able to rest in peace in the afterlife? But, friend, it has been more than a year since the victory, and the land is still full of the flames of war. The compatriots in the Northeast are reliving their dreams. Can they still rest in peace forever? The White Mountains and Black Waters are once again covered with dark clouds and turbulent currents. He is sleeping in a foreign land, and I am afraid he is also thinking of his distant homeland! Where is the victory that has been won? To whom does the victory belong? The gold, foreign houses, cars, and women of the receiving firemen, the mounds of bones, and the blood and tears of the common people. His beautiful dream was crushed by those criminals of the Republic of China, cleanly and thoroughly. Those are the people who have betrayed his hope!</p>
<p>Hey, friend, who exactly deceived you? The victory that has been won and lost can only wait for future history to answer you!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Crane—"Why is Konoe paying attention to a small character like me?"</p>
<p>Ping—"He didn't pay attention at first. It was the members of the General Staff and the Fifth Column who brought you up here."</p>
<p>Crane—"Do you think he's paying close attention to me now?"</p>
<p>Ping—"He said you are a promising young talent."</p>
<p>Crane—"How do you know?"</p>
<p>Ping—"Teacher Aoki told me this morning."</p>
<p>Crane—"How does Elder Aoki know?"</p>
<p>Ping—"He first used telepathy to investigate for you; then he confirmed it by telephone."</p>
<p>Crane—""Telepathy"... how is it used?"</p>
<p>Ping—"Telepathy is like a thinking communication technique. The person practicing the technique concentrates their thoughts and can explore the thoughts of others. Didn't I mention "Occultism" in the German's car yesterday? This use of telepathy is a kind of application skill in occultism."</p>
<p>Crane—"Then, you should also be able to use it."</p>
<p>Ping—"It's still very early. I'm just starting out, just doing preliminary work."</p>
<p>Crane—"Try it. Do you know what's on my mind?" (Crane is worried that Pingzi can really use telepathy.)</p>
<p>Ping—"I can try, but the power is too small, and there are many necessary conditions for performing the technique. First, extend your hand and let me hold it..."</p>
<p>The two stopped at the same time. Pingzi held Crane's left hand in her own two hands. They stood like this for a long time. Then Pingzi released her right hand, only holding Crane with her left hand. At this time, the moonlight was thicker, projecting the figures of the two onto the beach, forming a long pair of black shadows, standing opposite each other. Pingzi's pair of bright eyes stared at Crane. Crane looked serious and dignified, also looking at Pingzi. Pingzi, however, had a cheeky smile on her face. After a while, Pingzi spoke, saying Crane's thoughts:</p>
<p>"You are very beautiful, and you are also somewhat clever, but unfortunately, I don't love you... (Now the thoughts are changing), Are you playing tricks? Or do you really have magic powers? (It's changing again)... I will also concentrate my thoughts to resist, not let you know what I am thinking... (It's changing again) Concentrate a little... China... no... I can't think about these... Tokyo, not good either, the bright moon in the sky is very good... I want to go to the Moon Palace to rest for a while... What is the Moon Palace like? Are there mountains and water?... "</p>
<p>Pingzi said up to this point, leisurely let go of Crane's hand, turned around, covered her face with her hands, and began to sob softly. Although Crane was strong-willed, he was, after all, made of flesh and blood and could not be without emotion. At this moment, watching Pingzi suddenly sob while trying to perform telepathy, he knew that Pingzi must have been focusing her energy, but her skills were not deep enough, and she used too much force. Also, because he deliberately changed his thoughts and deliberately resisted strongly, her mental power suddenly showed a chaotic phenomenon, thus arousing emotions. He couldn't help but suddenly feel sad, feeling that this woman was so infatuated with him, it was quite pitiful. However, he was unable to comfort her. He was so embarrassed that he was at a loss, standing there blankly.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Chinese Girl</p>
<p>During the war, Hollywood produced many war films. Among those related to China, as far as I know, there are "Back to Bataan," "China Clipper," "The Chinese Children," "China Girl," etc.</p>
<p>As a Chinese person, seeing these films, to be honest, I don't feel interested. The themes, stories, etc., are wide of the mark, distort the facts, and are completely unreal. They are too detached from our lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, even with Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" and Paul Muni's acting skills, it failed to be welcomed by us, and that is why.</p>
<p>Crash</p>
<p>Gold and silver stocks have all fallen again.</p>
<p>Everyone could see this coming, but those who are obsessed will not have this realization.</p>
<p>Why? A friend told me that the rise is unlimited because people's desires are endless. The more it rises, the more people expect it to rise. Gold is best at one million, and US dollars at ten thousand... and the fall is limited. Falling to a certain degree, it will hurt, and people will not be willing to let it fall further.</p>
<p>Traffic Order</p>
<p>Recently, the traffic order in the city has deteriorated again. At five or six o'clock in the afternoon, it often takes more than twenty minutes for a car to go from the Bund to Chengdu Road, crossing Nanjing Road. I would like to raise the following specific questions to the responsible authorities:</p>
<p>(1) Is one-way traffic on Sichuan Road very suitable?</p>
<p>(2) Is there a standard for opening and closing the red silk lights?</p>

<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>In half a month, Shanghai citizens have been startled twice. Once, it was because the ban on street vendors caused riots. Street vendors were originally a small problem. Why did it turn from small to large, causing an uproar? Because the street vendors want to eat!</p>
<p>The street vendor problem has just been resolved, and the Jiangwan Arsenal exploded with a bang again. The cause has not yet been officially announced, but according to the soldiers near the scene of the accident, "When grenades were being moved into the warehouse, it was lunchtime. At that time, a warehouse soldier shouted, 'It's time to eat!' The porter was absent-minded and arbitrarily unloaded the entire box of grenades he was carrying, which collided with the ground and caused a disaster." If the rumor is true, the cause of this disaster was also to eat! The difference is that the street vendors were forced to stand up because their existing rice bowls were broken, while the porters had rice bowls and, thinking about the difficulty of eating today, their hearts blossomed when they heard the call to eat, and they were careless in their work. This caused a disaster.</p>
<p>The roots of both disasters were to eat. "Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," is indeed true.</p>
<p>Now that industry and commerce are declining and all industries are sluggish, there are at least two million unemployed citizens in Shanghai. In order to prevent the recurrence of the third and fourth unfortunate events, I hope that those who care about the people's livelihood should make preparations before it rains!</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, I borrowed 20,000 yuan from a friend, agreeing to return it to him yesterday morning. Yesterday, in order to repay this debt, I also ran around outside, but to no avail, so I am still anxiously waiting today.</p>
<p>This afternoon, a policeman in green came and handed me a letter. When I saw it, it was sent by this friend. I naturally understood what this letter should say, and then a chill followed the excitement.</p>
<p>I trembled and tore open the envelope.</p>
<p>"Strange, why is it just an empty envelope? Where did the letter go?" When I opened it and found that there was no letter paper, I couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>"Who lost faith? Who lost faith?"... My wife ran out of the kitchen, asking in a panic.</p>
<p>"I... I am the one who lost faith... ah..." I suddenly realized.</p>

<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the traitors who had submitted to the enemy puppets were also called "fallen people." Someone translated it as "Waterman."</p>
<p>But someone asked this translator, if the fallen person is very powerful and transforms himself, and still holds a position after the victory, how should such a person be translated? He said: This is undoubtedly "Waterproof."</p>
<p>A male student was infatuated with a certain woman. He presumptuously sent her a love letter, but it was difficult to address her. He used "Beautiful Brand" instead of the lady's name on the letter. She was puzzled when she received it. Later, she found out that Beautiful Brand was "my dear," so she was very angry. As a result, she also returned a letter to him, using "Good Year" instead of the male student's name on the letter. He opened it and didn't understand what "Good Year" meant. Later, after inquiring in various ways, he learned that "Good Year" was the famous Goodyear rubber car tire. It can be said to be a tooth for a tooth, tit for tat.</p>
<p>A foreign sociologist studied the problem of prostitutes in China. Among them, there is the so-called "half-open door," which the translator translated as half open door. The foreigner thought about this for a long time and sighed: In foreign countries, there is only the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy, (open door policy) and I have not heard of a "half-open door." The translator is also a complete bookworm. He said that perhaps this is a compromise.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in school, a classmate used Kiss and Miss very cleverly in verbs and nouns. I will record it for a laugh:</p>
<p>"It is better to kiss a miss than to miss a kiss"</p>
<h3 id="e181">Regarding "Misleading the Children" <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>I occasionally wrote a story about "misleading the children," which unexpectedly aroused Mr. Fang Cheng's "resonance." However, he seemed to express quite a bit of sympathy for the teacher who "misled the children."</p>
<p>I originally didn't dare to make too much of a fuss, but I boldly say that countless teachers who have "misled the children" cannot but thank this defense.</p>
<p>I am very ashamed. I not only did not cross the gate of the university, but also did not graduate from middle school. The war has affected my personal education, and I have been running around for eight years. Therefore, I decided to return to school again. Fortunately, I managed to get into a vocational school with equivalent academic ability. Unexpectedly, the reality is too disappointing! My naked article was written after experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>I sympathize with the "crime of the scholar," which is sometimes wronged. I sympathize with the teaching profession, which is very hard. I also quite understand the importance of respecting teachers, and I don't think I should criticize teachers too much. However, what is school for? Is it possible to allow the habit of "fooling around" in the officialdom to intrude?</p>
<p>If it is said that the party and the league should withdraw from the school, then the teachers who are "fooling around" must first withdraw from the school.</p>
<p>If they do not prepare before class, "the gimmicks are too good" during class, there are classes outside of class, and there are topics outside of the topic. They brag and talk nonsense. When half the time has passed, they say, "I'm sorry for leaving early." This kind of teacher's "misleading of the children," I think, is definitely not Guan Yu's "wronging him!"</p>
<p>Yes, the students' level after the Anti-Japanese War is generally low, but precisely because of this, we hope that the teachers can put in more effort! I also hope that the school will be more serious. Mr. Fang Cheng has been teaching for many years and feels that "misleading the children" seems to be a "trumped-up charge." In the lines, he cleverly makes implicit defenses for his colleagues. Those teachers who are fooling around will thank you, but the thousands of students who are eagerly seeking knowledge will be exactly the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Taking Advantage of Other People's Joy <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>A few days ago, a Shen Bao reader revealed a new scam: "Recently, some people have been running around in major hotels and wedding families. When the ceremony is about to be held, they seal a 100,000 or 200,000 enemy puppet period check, send a big gift, and swindle 10,000 or 20,000 yuan in joint force. Running ten or eight houses a day, the income is quite considerable."</p>
<p>This kind of scam is not taking advantage of people's danger, but taking advantage of people's joy.</p>
<p>In fact, the scam of taking advantage of people's joy has been popular at sea for a long time. In addition to the above, there are also those who pretend to be students and old friends, eat wedding banquets for free, mix with the guests, enter and leave the bridal chamber, and steal women's clothing and ornaments. It is also heard from time to time; however, people who do happy events are all joyful, harmonious, and generally unwilling to put on a face and argue with people; moreover, one can only have a few happy events in one's life, so even if they suffer a small loss once, they will let it go. Especially now that happy events are held, they are mostly combined by the men's and women's families, and the guests of the two houses do not know each other.</p>
<p>This kind of con man who takes advantage of other people's joy is using this advantageous occasion to perform!</p>
<p>The methods of prevention are:</p>
<p>(1) Gift money is handed over to the bank for collection and donated to charity.</p>
<p>(2) After the bank collects the money, it issues admission tickets on behalf of the guests. Guests enter the venue with tickets.</p>

<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that the two children, Jiang Lingdi and Jiang Maomao, of Xietai Bank, disappeared at the same time. The next day, they were suddenly found in Gujia Park, and the security guard reported to the police and sent them back. According to the two children, two people took them into a car and drove away quickly. After delaying them for one night, they were sent to this park the next morning. The matter is quite suspicious, whether it is a prank by an enemy, or there is another purpose, it has not yet been clarified. It is indeed unbelievable. According to what my friend knows, similar incidents have occurred recently, not just the two Jiang children. Because the children have no damage, each parent knows less is better than more, so they do not pursue it. Even the police station does not pursue it because this kind of behavior is neither kidnapping for ransom nor inducing and剥夺 children.</p>
<p>However, are they full, have nothing to do, and are joking with children? Of course not. According to my friend's speculation, their target is the children's urine. It seems like a smile is not worth it, but in the era when Chinese medicine is still being promoted, pure boy urine is a treasure that money cannot买到. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use cars to pick up and send the children who produce道种.</p>
<p>Now there is a kind of national medicine, called "× Stone", which is expensive and exceeds ginseng. It sells well in various ports in Southeast Asia. The raw material of Daoyao is made by煎炼using boy urine. The urine excreted by fat white children under the age of twelve from good families is the most suitable. All postpartum disorders, yin deficiency and prolonged coughs, and pulmonary tuberculosis with hemoptysis have miraculous effects after taking it. In the past, in 1927, there was also this kind of trick in Hangzhou. Later, the case was solved by the police station, but it was done by an old Min from a medicinal materials store. It can be seen that there is nothing strange in the world.</p>

<p>Common Sense Test</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Problem of a Piece of Ice <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Yichang</p>
<p>Although Jiangnan is warmer than the northern regions, every year in the deep winter, it inevitably experiences frost and ice a few times. Last time, we talked about the scientific common sense of various heating methods. This time, let's take ice as the theme and write ten questions for everyone to try.</p>
<p>If scientific common sense can be mixed with everyday phenomena around us, not only is the interest stronger, but it is also easier to remember. People around middle school age should be able to answer more than six questions. A side note: the temperatures mentioned below refer to the "centigrade scale," that is, the Celsius scale. The answers will be published in this column tomorrow.</p>
<p>(1) We all already know that the "freezing point" of water is zero degrees. But I want to ask the opposite question: when the temperature of extremely pure water gradually decreases and falls below zero degrees, do you think:</p>
<p>A, it must freeze completely at zero degrees without exception?</p>
<p>B, it starts to freeze when it is slightly above zero degrees?</p>
<p>C, extremely pure water can be cooled to four degrees below zero before freezing?</p>
<p>(2) In an electric refrigerator, we put the following three bowls of liquid, and then gradually lower the temperature inside the refrigerator. Which of the three bowls do you think will freeze first, which will freeze second, and which will freeze last? Please fill in the order in the parentheses.</p>
<p>A, Extremely pure water ( )</p>
<p>B, Bone broth or pig trotter soup ( )</p>
<p>C, Salt water ( )</p>
<p>(3) There is a glass, its capacity is exactly enough to hold roughly 1000 c.c. of ice. At this time, the surface of the ice block is exactly "level with the mouth of the glass," no more, no less. If the ice in this glass melts, and is then filled with hot boiling water at 100 degrees, and it also reaches "level with the mouth of the glass," how much would be needed:</p>
<p>A, Only 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water?</p>
<p>B, Less than 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water to fill it?</p>
<p>C, Or, more than 1000 c.c. of hot boiling water is needed to fill it?</p>
<p>(4) Put a piece of ice of known volume into a measuring cup with markings, and cover the mouth of the cup with a glass slide to prevent water vapor from escaping. At that time, the temperature of the ice was exactly zero degrees. Afterwards, it slowly changes to water due to room temperature, and then becomes hot water due to heating. Precisely speaking, how does the volume (c.c.) change from ice to hot water? Is it:</p>
<p>A, Always the same from beginning to end, neither increasing nor decreasing?</p>
<p>B, Decreasing slightly at first and then slowly increasing?</p>
<p>C, Or, always increasing from beginning to end?</p>
<p>(5) One kilogram of ice (zero degrees), poured into fifty kilograms of boiling water (one hundred degrees). The ice melts when it encounters heat. Do you think:</p>
<p>A, This kilogram of ice immediately and completely melts into water?</p>
<p>B, The water after the ice has completely melted is also very warm?</p>
<p>C, Or, if not relying on room temperature as a supplement, numerically speaking, this boiling water still cannot completely melt the ice?</p>
<p>(6) Without the help of room temperature, roughly calculate, how many cups (cups of the same capacity) of extremely hot boiling water (one hundred degrees) do you think it would take to melt a cup of ice into water? (Note: The steam from the boiling water is not included.)</p>
<p>A, Eighty cups?</p>
<p>B, One hundred and twenty cups?</p>
<p>C, Ten cups?</p>
<p>(7) It is commonly said that the freezing point of water is zero degrees. But please answer the following:</p>
<p>A, Is the temperature of all ice zero degrees without exception?</p>
<p>B, Can the temperature of ice be below zero degrees?</p>
<p>C, Or, is the lowest temperature of ice always zero degrees?</p>
<p>(8) After the surface of the ocean and large lakes freeze, there is still liquid seawater and lake water underneath. Then, do you think the water temperature of these two is:</p>
<p>A, Higher for fresh water than for salt water?</p>
<p>B, Higher for salt water than for fresh water?</p>
<p>C, Or, the same for both?</p>
<p>(9) To raise the temperature of ice by one degree and to raise the temperature of the same weight of water by one degree, which do you think is easier, i.e., requires less "heat"?</p>
<p>A, Is it easier to raise the temperature of ice?</p>
<p>B, Is it easier to raise the temperature of water?</p>
<p>C, Or, is it the same for both?</p>
<p>(10) To heat one kilogram of ice at zero degrees and turn it into cold water at zero degrees, how much heat is required? Do you think it is equivalent to how many kilograms of cold water heated from zero degrees to warm water equal to human body temperature (thirty-seven degrees)? Roughly speaking:</p>
<p>A, Equivalent to the heat required to heat one kilogram of cold water as described above to form warm water?</p>
<p>B, Equivalent to the heating of twenty kilograms of cold water as described above?</p>
<p>C, Or, equivalent to the heating of eighty kilograms of cold water as described above?</p>
<p>The answers will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
