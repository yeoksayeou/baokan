<p>馬歇爾元帥一昨在京發布他到華以來首次官式新聞稱，指陳國共雙方的惡意擴大宣傳，互播猜疑嫉恨，使自今嚴重的局勢更形惡化，其結果足使中國人民遭罹大難。調處執行小組的工作因此項宣傳深入雙方官佐士兵而特感困難，而中國的鬥爭能否停止或至少使其地方化却基於調處執行小組的努力。馬特使到業以來，奔走調停，勞瘁不辭，中國人民對於這位五星元帥的宿夜辛勤，無不由衷表示誠摯的感奮；而寄予殷切的期望。馬元帥是卓越的軍人政治家，到華以來，脚踏實地，埋頭苦幹，不尙空言，這種精神，尤為中國人民所佩仰。一昨在京所發布的文稿，是馬帥到華以來首次官式新聞稿，旨在指陳惡意的宣傳，徒然布嫉恨與猜疑，轉使局勢惡化，調處執行小組工作為難。對於馬帥的指陳，我們不勝表示同情。的確，惡意的宣傳，其作用徒在刺　感情，增加　恨與猜疑，而局勢愈趨惡化。專從事與刺　感情的宣傳，不但無補大局，為害實在匪淺。馬帥在他到華後首次官式新聞稿裏提出這點，我們深佩馬帥見解的卓越。在馬帥的文告內既然提到惡意宣傳的為害足使中國人民遭罹大難，我們站在中國人民的立場，願約略申述我們的所見。</p>
<p>第一，中國共產黨，像世界其它各地的共產黨一樣，是宣傳能手，他們用種種方法致力於他們的宣傳。不要說別的，一看重慶出版的新華日報，便可知他們如何展開他們的宣傳戰略。美國艦船輸送國軍前往東北是一個盟邦對戰友的一種種流言，不曰美軍參加中國「內戰」，即曰美軍進擊共軍，凡此所為，在共黨原有目的，不待多方。綜觀過去事實，共軍於進據一地後，即發動一次宣傳攻勢，再殿以一次實際行動；所謂「中原之戰」，即其明證。至於國民黨方面，上有蔣主席的領導，格於國內外的現實形勢，從不屑運用宣傳攻勢，頂多於必要時為適當的防衛而已。共黨造謠有過份者，加以否認之，從沒有像共黨那樣屢屢發動宣傳攻勢的；因此，有一部人士。包括一部份國外人士在內，頗不滿於國民黨方面的消極姿態。所以過去的種種擴大宣傳，實出共黨主動，這是關於責任方面不能不提出的一點。</p>
<p>第二，以往惡意擴大宣傳旣由共黨主動，我們同情馬帥的指陳，要遏止這種惡意宣傳的持續，首先要希望共黨能放棄它過去採取的宣傳策略。馬帥所指斥的是對的，我們的親感和馬帥相同，要使大局不再惡化，必須停止一切惡意的宣傳。過去共黨方面旣努力於嫉恨宣傳攻勢的展開，則要停止一切惡意宣傳，必須共黨放棄它所慣用的宣傳策略。因此我們對於馬帥文告內所用的「雙方」字樣，不無感覺遺憾。明明是一方在運用宣傳戰略，而在馬帥的文告內却使用「雙方」字樣，此戰為一種必要的外交辭令，但其結果，却足以助長共黨的氣燄，而遂其宣傳的企圖。馬帥身為第三者，不便左右袒，但是非却不能不分，責任不能不明，更何況共黨的行動，旨在顛覆政府，依照法理論，一方為謀叛，絕對不能相提並論。而今有「雙方」</p>
<p>第三，中國人民，特別是從「解放區」內逃亡出來的人民，他們一般對於共黨深切的認識，而對共黨加以抨責；這是人民的意向，沒有一個政府可以抑止人民的思想和言論，中國自亦不能例外。共產黨在中國的紀錄，沒有一個真正的中國人能夠稱讚，殺人放火以及一切無惡不作的罪行深印在每一個中國人的心坎深處。對於共產黨的嫉恨，可以說是一般中國人的心情，共產黨雖有它廣大的控制區域，但這些區域的統治却建立在它所有的武力上，而不在民心上。中國共產澡的眞正黨員，在全國人口中所占的百分比可謂極低——還不及百分之一，所以中國的命運，決不能到取決於共產黨。共產黨之所以有現在的跋　，實由於若干國外的觀察家不明中國人民的意向而給予它以過分不當的或過高的估計。這局勢必須糾正過來，中國纔能有持久的安定。</p>
<p>記得當馬帥蒞華之初，我們希望馬帥給予中國人民的至少有像拉斐德給予美國人民的那樣，無疑地，現在中國的情勢與當時美國的情勢不能相提並論。這是一個更艱巨的工作，以馬帥的才智，決沒有不可克服的困難。我們希望馬帥的成功，中國的持久安定，世界的持久和平，其關鍵全在乎此。望之也殷。因之也不覺言之也切了。</p>
<h3 id="c31">事實勝於雄辯 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>這幾天來，國內政局沉悶得似入靜誤狀態，重開和平談判與繼續協商之說，雖也不絕如　；但是在另一方面，軍事衝突的鑼鼓喧天，一陣又緊一陣，友邦人士雖然奔走號呼，極盡調處的能事，恐亦未必能挽回當前的危局，誠令人歏息痛恨。中外各報對於各地衝突的情形，均已詳細的記載，但昨獲中共代表陸定一來函聲明，對於外國記者所發關於中共的若干報導予以否認。</p>
<p>我們人民雖屬於第三者的地位，但仍是國家的主人翁，在國內危機千鈞一髮之際，再不該糊塗下去，不問事理，嘴邊亂嚷着停止內戰，漫無是非曲直之感；而應該提高警覺，正視現實，眼睛雪亮，對於誰在弄兵作亂？誰欲以武力解決？又誰應負衝突之責任？都應該獨照無遺。</p>
<p>我們不願多費筆墨，所謂事實勝於雄辯，請看下面的事實。</p>
<p>（一）在東北，共軍悍然不顧整軍方案，假借「民主聯軍」的名義，以琥力奪取長春與哈爾濱，企圖擴充地盤，佔領整個東北九省，絕不肯放鬆一點。現在中共反而高唱「無條件停戰」無非要政府和調入，承認它的旣成事實。幸國軍昨已收復四平街，長哈兩城可望於週內克復。</p>
<p>（二）在華北，更是戰亂如麻，烽火遍地，北寗路迭　共軍破壞，已遍體鱗傷，不堪再用。現共軍又自冀察兩省調兵向熱河增援，發動大攻勢；除佔領北票而外，並進攻赤峯，刻在承德以東為國軍所阻。此在平津一帶，風聲鶴唳，已受共軍大包圍，共軍攻入門頭溝之後，離北平僅十七里，弄得人心惶惶，不可終日，每夜提早關城門；天津也在同樣狀態之中，在城外十里之內，就有共軍蹤跡，草木皆兵，人心更加恐慌萬狀。</p>
<p>（三）在津浦路北段，也是戰雲迷漫，共軍攻佔滄縣泊鎭，戰事猛烈，南段也在戰亂之中。</p>
<p>（四）在山西，共軍猛攻朔縣不已，大同也感受威脅。</p>
<p>（五）在山東，共軍發動大攻勢後，相繼佔領明水與龍山兩城，魯中停戰協定雖已成立，但有誰能保證共軍不再進攻！所以濟南與青島，不能謂業已轉危為安。</p>
<p>（六）在蘇北，共軍蠢蠢欲動，揚言井進攻揚泰南通等城，已非一日，蘇北流亡青年，散遍江南各地成為一大羣河憐無告的難民。又是誰之賜　？</p>
<p>以上所述，都是鐵一般的事實，決非共代表的一紙聲明所能否認的。又昨日馬歇爾特使敬告雙方勿再採取惡意宣傳，中共發言竟謂此非針對共黨而發，又企圖把惡意宣傳的責任推諉與人，中共之言，又有誰能相信呢？</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯今日向全國及世界各國廣播巴黎四國外長會議經過情形，〔昨日本報收聽舊金山之廣播，已扼要揭載其內容〕，略謂：四國外長此次討論歐洲各國和約草案，鮮有成　，殊足令人失望，惟經此交換意見結果，相知益深，此種進展實較預期者為大。締造「各民族的和平」原屬長期艱難工作，未可以外交方面一蹴而幾，此需忍耐與堅定，寬容與諒解，始克有濟，必不可以吾人之意志強人接受，但亦必須使對方明瞭亦不能以其意志強制吾人接受。</p>
<p>貝氏今日之措詞針對蘇聯，其言曰：無論任何大國，對於和約之草擬，不能行使否決權。歐洲和平大會今夏倘不召集，美國將訴之聯合國大會，使之提出建議。美國曾於巴黎四國外長會議，採取「和平攻勢」，今後將繼續不斷全力以赴，直至獲致目的而後已。此種和約並不以報復與貪婪為基礎，乃為正義之和平，亦為唯一可持久之和平。美國政策目的有三：即德國工業廿五年管制計劃之實施，奧地利境內聯合國軍隊之迅速撤退，有功於歐戰勝利之全體國家和平大會。於七月一日或十五日這召開是也。凡此種切，予當決心使之完成，和平大會之目的在於訂立對義大利，巴爾幹各國與芬蘭之和約。此項要求曾遭蘇聯代表團之阻碍，該代表團憑藉會議程序須全體一致同意之規定，堅持在和約全部基本問題解決之前，不能發出召開和平大會之結果。蘇聯堅持義大利賠款一萬萬元，即其所謂基本問題之一例，美國已耗費數千萬元養活義大利人，並須在金融上援助該國經濟復興，然後再從義大利此種經濟中撥付賠償，如此償付借款實非美國所願，惟美國曾指示蘇聯另一賠款方式，蘇聯又不願，美國所提議者即如以義大利一部份艦隊作為賠款，但蘇聯堅持此乃該國之戰利品權利，惟戰利品向例為　　國家之財產，蘇聯抑從未提議與盟邦分享其任何戰利品。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿一日電〕敎育部今日公布：自本年十月起·凡獲得大學獎學金之英格蘭與威爾斯男女學生·其家長進款每年不及一千五百鎊者，政府將一律予以津貼。家長進款不到六百鎊者，政府更將補助其獎學金不敷繳納之學費及生活費用。敎育部已將津貼數量，自進款每年一千五百鎊以下，分成等級。此項計劃，將使國家在獎學金與津貼」上之開支每年達八十萬鎊。獎學金大致每年不超過一百鎊，迄今獲得獎學金之學生，因每學年費用須三百至四百鎊，故不得不依賴地方敎育當局之津貼或貸金。國家獎學金每年一向僅三百六十名，其中牛數授予持有大學獎學金之學生，最近公布之津貼計劃，乃一九四三年六月諾爾烏德委員會一項提案之實行：「凡獲得大學獎學金者，即有申請公家津貼之權。」此外敎育部，尙實踐諾爾烏德另一項提案，即現行中等學校考試，即將廢止，代以一種二部考試：一部爲大學獎學金考試，另一部爲大學入學考試，或免試初步職業考試之檢定試驗。同時現行十四歲至十七歲間畢業考試，亦將取消，或澈底改良，以便解除學生於十七歲以前考試之束縛，而盡力適應學生之個別需要。敎育部之目的，在覓得保存學校成績之新技術，以發現個別學生之才能與智力。</p>

<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>自從勝利以後，滬江大學準備遷回軍工路原校，經過新任校長凌憲揚氏和幾位敎授月的視察，交涉，和募捐，克復了種種困難。終於在四月二十一日完成遷移工作，二十二日正式在原校上踝。</p>
<p>四月二十六日那大，在宏麗的大禮堂上，舉行了一個慶成復校遊藝大會。凌校長和敎授們都偕同夫人，聯袂參加。是日節日精彩，以雷垣敎授的鋼鋸（樂器名）獨奏，博得掌聲最多，師生間溶成一片。</p>
<p>全校學生確數是九百零一人，僅十多個同學走讀，餘都住校。大禮堂很寬敞，整整有一千個座位，所以每逢開會，足够容納全校同學面有餘。</p>
<p>統計全校面積，佔地三三〇畝，大小房屋共有四十三幢。</p>
<p>男生宿舍佔「思伊』，「思裴」兩堂，女生宿舍也佔兩幢。男女宿舍門前，分別懸有「女客止步」或「男客止步」字牌。</p>
<p>校內風景絕佳，惜乎經日寇盤據多年，破壞很多，已大不如前了。幾棵數抱的大樹，被日寇移植江灣，最近一再向當局交涉，準備移回。</p>
<p>每星期校內舉行紀念週會兩次。凌校長每次都出席報吿校務，第一次週會上說；「估計此次戰爭，學校損失約在十萬萬元以上，修築費截至目前已用去三萬萬元，待修的東西尙多，而經費相當困難，大多賴教會方面協助，並不向同學募集。」週會，學生們都須出席，對號入座，秩序井然。</p>
<p>圖書館，有書籍五萬三千餘册，每日並有報紙多種，供學生閱豐。</p>
<p>學校裏的飲水，爲愼重起見，曾送市衛生局檢騐，結果認爲相當淸潔。</p>
<p>爲了學生的需要，校內已有理髮室及洗衣舖的設立，價廉物美，頗受同學歡迎。</p>
<p>此外，爲顧全敎授子弟的敎育起見，最近有設立小學的提議，由敎育學系同學執敎，實地試騐。每日下午四時至六時，可以自由出入學校，其餘時間出外，須向訓導處吿假，辦理相當嚴格，因爲凌校長對於「校風」，非常軍視。</p>
<p>校門外的金字校名牌，是鄭章成博士題寫的。鄭博士是滬江理學院的創辦人，服務已數千年，數莖白髮，閱盡滄桑，現在又見到凌憲揚氏出任校長，任務艱鉅，再接再厲地爲母校打定了新生的基礎，也當拈鬚微笑了。</p>

<p>第二塲良華對信號，開始前，劉荷生報吿，熱心體育之程伯庵君，捐助地板經費一百萬元，觀衆聞訊，大爲鼓掌。鳴笛啟賽，兩隊難解難分，曾造四度平手。八比八後，良華以張少卿代出果必顯，震中聿恭雙建奇功，反以十二對十一超出。良華一路領前，前半結果，廿八對廿五，良華佔先三分。</p>
<p>休息時間，公佈門票收人，計榮譽券廿二張，二千元券六百九十二張，一千元券八百卅一張，總共收入二百五十七萬四千元。</p>
<p>再戰聲起，良華表演精彩，沈聿恭劉福善有投必中，卅七對廿九後，信號始由塞摩勒投入一球。唐寳堃梅開二度，四十三比廿九，遙遙在前，四十九對卅四時，塞摩勒五次犯規被糶，信號難挽狂瀾，終塲時良華以五七對四三大勝信號。</p>

<p>「査本市米糧存底，並不缺乏，到貨不絕，供求旣屬正常，市面自可安定，乃近日米價飛漲，波動甚劇，顯有不法之徒，從中囤積操縱，希圖暴利，茲爲安定民生起見，業已令飭有關各業申報存糧，並嚴禁業外人投機買賣，各在案，如仍有不肖之徒，罔顧大局，投機抬價，准人民據實檢舉，聽候嚴懲，如査明確有非法囤積情事，除將囤米悉數充公外，並提出總値之半數充獎，以資鼓勵，除分行外，合行佈吿週知」云云</p>
<p>米商會議</p>
<p>本市豆米行業及米號業兩公會於木月二十日奉社會局令飭各會員限於三日內塡報存糧數額，該兩公會當即召開理事緊急會議，討論辦法，尅日通吿各會員，限期填報，惟因會員衆多，散居全市，恐不克如期辦妥云。</p>
<p>又訊，四馬路靑蓮閣米市塲，奉社會局訓令，規定該市塲每日應將賣買雙方之字號及其經理姓名，成交價與數量詳細分別呈報，以憑核辦，限文到之日起即行遵辦，該市塲當即通吿米商，凡在市塲買賣行號各商，自即日起將賣員雙方字號經理姓名成交價格及數量詳細分別塡表三份，逐日報會，以憑彙轉。</p>
<p>改組市塲</p>
<p>本市米市塲現有機構，亦有改組之訊。緣本市米市塲，於戰前分有南北兩市塲，戰後始集中於靑運閣爲臨時市塲，因地小人衆管理困難，易爲投機份子所混入，日來米價飛漲，負責當局除作各項有效措置外，並由社會局令飭上海市米市塲管理委員會，仍恢復南北兩市塲交易。規定北市市塲仍設米行公會原址內，南市市塲設於萃秀堂。並令擬具改組具體辦法呈報憑核。</p>
<p>定購洋米</p>
<p>糧次龐松舟昨晨偕滬糧署汪代特派員達人由京乘車抵滬後，即趨訪敵產處理局劉局長及吳市長，商談對滬市糧食調配之計劃，據糧署負責人云，糧部截至最近爲止，直接或間接，向南美洲及暹羅等地，已訂購洋米十六萬餘噸，（聯總分配之十二萬噸米在外）尙有小麥等類在接洽中，所訂之米，已在陸續起運途中，本月內首批一萬餘噸，即可抵達滬岸，至於川米運濟華中及長江下游事，早經開始，二週後，當有卅餘艘專輪載運川米供應下游一帶，洋米與川米源源而來，滬，粤，漢，湘，當前糧荒或可解救。</p>
<p>又訊，中國糊食工業公司，總公司原設重慶，抗戰期間，在後方辦理軍糧民食之加工，及糧食運銷業務，規模宏大，最近在滬籌設辦事處，並已向各進口商行，訂購洋米約有二百餘萬大包，船期均在六月七月間，聞該公司近因滬地糧價上漲，決將所訂購之洋米，分售於本市各實銷米號，及工廠，有此大宗米源，本年靑黃不接時期，本市民食可吿無處云。</p>
<p>米價回落</p>
<p>因當局雷厲風行，各方面咸具戒心，昨日米市消化呆滯，大戶求脫，苦無受主，市塲成交數寥寥無幾，價格續跌二三千元，麵粉亦再小五六百元，油市續挫一二千元，豆餅步削四五百元，黃豆續疲一二千元。昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共五千八百餘石，至一般囤戶，及堆存米糧各業，則正在準備塡表報會，以憑依限彙轉，據社會局消息，昨日逕向該局探詢報告方式者，亦復不少，該局均指令向各該業公會申報，以便彙集。</p>
<p>又米商方面消息：近日來各產區對米糧出口留難情事，顯已减少。故到貨漸見疏暢。滯留南京之蕪秈數十車，於日前已有二十車運抵本市，運輸川米二百萬担之事，糧部與招商民生兩輪船公司談治，業將成熟，即可起運云。</p>
<p>平價麵粉</p>
<p>社會局爲救濟民食起見，已設法麵粉若干，準備平價發賣。擬每日出售一千五百包。委託五十家米店代售·以窮困平民爲對象。每人限購六市斤·價格則照市價六折計算。社會局並定於今日召集此五十家店號之負責人開會，商討發賣手續，務期實惠及民。</p>

<h3 id="c108">朝野一致推重的社會賢達　經濟部長王雲五 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 本報廿日南京通訊　特約記者趙浩生</p>
<p>世界上再沒有比從事業上造成他的社會地位的人，更値得尊敬了。「王雲五」是一個與「商務印書館」不可分開的名字。王雲五先生的事業，是建立在那纍纍萬卷與千萬人的進步生活密切相連的畫册上·</p>
<p>這位爲朝野共同推重的社會賢達，是一個有着孩子氣味的「老年人」，雖然看上去已經鬚髮　然，然而他的精神，風度，和對一切事務的興趣與注意力，却有着孩子樣的生動，蓬勃，充滿了飛翔跳躍的生命力。那皤然的鬚髮，僅成了他特殊豐采的點綴。</p>
<p>銀白短髮　身材肥矮結實</p>
<p>他的身材肥矮，但十分結實，頭頂已現光秃，唇上有着一抹極其濃重的銀白短鬚，說話聲音宏兆，吐字淸晰，且富於聲音表情，他的純粹的國語和明快的手勢，會使人對他的談話注意，而且能澈底了解。</p>
<p>「政治協商會議」開會時，王雲五先生是以無黨無派社會賢達資格，被邀出席。在那波浪翻騰的會議進程中，社會賢達代表，始終是比較沉靜。口字形的會議桌，他們佔據在右邊的一端。王雲五先生坐在傳斯年之右，胡霖的對面，這沉靜的一角，也是極爲旁聽者所注視的一角。因爲在某些問題上，只有從這裏才能找到一些正確的答案，尤其是王雲五先生，人們可以從他那富於表情的面孔上，測騐到整個會塲的空氣。他常常與傳斯年胡霖二入筆談耳語，在發現彼此的感覺不約而同的時候，他會愉快的抓着那光秃的頭皮，甚至作着鬼臉。</p>
<p>會議席間　笑浪層層翻騰</p>
<p>記得有一天，討論國大問題時，章伯鈞在發言中拿出一份許久以前的大公報，朗讀上面的一篇社論，以證明他不承認舊代表的理論，也是無黨無派者的意見，朗　運五分鐘之久。王雲五和傅斯年紛紛以紙條遞向對面的胡霖，做是在向胡先生祝賀：「大公報居然有這麽一偶忠誠的讀者！一當時，王雲五先生孩子般興趣盎然表情，傳斯年那眯成了一條縫的近視眼，和胡霖那肥碩的面孔，凑成了一幅對發言者的諷刺畫面。因爲在那以代表民意姿態出現的莊嚴集會中，實在是有着許多不能不使人發笑的事情。</p>
<p>局面混亂　依然指揮若定</p>
<p>在這政治協商會議中，無黨無派代表並不是毫無意見的袖手旁觀者。當某些問題爭論得不可了結時，他們往往是以「不能不說幾句」的神情，站起來發言了。王雲五先生是其中發言較多的一位，他發言時的態度，極鄭重，極忠懇。他擺動着那髮鬚皤然的頭，揮動着短而有力的手臂，語音朗朗，字字淸晰，那條分　析侃侃而談的風度，會使人想起英國議會裏的人物，他的座位正對着邵從恩老先生，他那生力磅　的神態，與邵老發言時能鐘抖動，顫　編的表情，同時極其感人的鏡頭。記得有一次，談到國大的名額問題，王先生以他的「算盤」，作科學式的分配，贏得全塲大笑。</p>
<p>在歷届參政會中，王雲五先生也是一位極有能力的主席，他精神抖擻，以「科學管理」的方法控制着大會的時間，一絲不苟，一絲不亂，在最混亂的情况下，他能指揮若定。</p>
<p>王雲五先生是一位生力磅　的老年人，是一位能以嚴格的科學方法治事，以樂觀進取的態度生活的人。</p>
<p>辦事精神　帶到政治裏面</p>
<p>在道次政府改組伊始，他首光被邀出長經濟部·王先生過去在事萊上的成就，會保證他一定可以成爲一眞眞正爲人民作事的好官要。中國的政治要進步，必須要在這幾近優化的機構上注入新血液。中國需要民主，但中國不需要員空賣空專門喊口號，玩政治把戲的「馬路政客」，這裏我要再說一旬：「世界上再沒有比從事業上造成他的社會地位的人，更値得人民尊敬了！」我們希望王雲五先生把他從事事業的精神帶到政治裏去，希望這位在事業上成功的戰士，能打破政治上一切因循的積習，在政治民主化道路上，作爲一個老而彌駡的開路先鋒。</p>
<p>王雲五</p>

<h3 id="c109">長春廿九天 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者邵愼之</p>
<p>這個時候，砲火依舊非常激烈。我們決定一方面懸掛中美兩國國旗，一方面把中外記者團招待所的木牌掛在大門口。木牌上的字，是世洵寫的；美國國旗，是國際社艾伯娜女士和另一位外面附近請來的日本少女，一同縫製的。大家好笑，這是美日兩國合作的東西！</p>
<p>外面打得雖激烈，我們屋子裏確反見得十分溫暖和寗逸。趙君邁和艾伯娜都是威士康辛大學的同學，他們兩人合唱校歌，或會同作橋戲。我們中國記者，則對坐下奕。可是下了半天，頭腦子終於是被槍聲攪亂了，滿盤散棋，不知所云。</p>
<p>下午愈打愈近，南方共軍主力已越過了大陸科學院，動植物院，順天公園，而進佔了滿炭大樓。滿炭正在我們記者招待所正前面三百公尺，搶彈打中樓上，貝克特和世洵住的房間，由外玻璃窗打進，直把牆壁打成一個洞。我們的寓所儼然成了火綫上的標的。我們決定遷人地下室中去睡，美記者睡在會客室中的地板上。</p>
<p>夜裏月亮特別好，我們屋子圍墻的四周，佈了一排警察，每個人有一枝步槍和幾個手溜彈。聚精會神的由劉排長指揮。午夜二時，我們從甜夢中驚醒，連珠般的槍聲吶喊聲，正在我們屋子圍墻的四周，打得更密集了。我們都知道，今天晚上，一定會出亂子。劉隊長進來通知我們，要我們事先準備，以應萬一。趙君邁頭腦淸楚，嚴重在意我們，尤其是美國朋友的安全。他吩咐劉隊長：「果眞共軍來了，原則上不要和他們開槍，但得說明，這裏是中外記者寓所，是一個中立性的所在地。」</p>
<p>隨着從這個演變的，就是趙君邁不得不再考慮他本身的身份問題了。在槍雨彈林中，趙似乎自已也覺到，局面決不是像他自己樂觀意識中想像的那麼平穩。他首先向我們中外記者說；「從現在起，你們不要再喊我趙市長了，我得暫時隱蔽一下才好。」我們贊同他的意見，但是當時想不出來，用什麼辦法可以解決他的困難，後來還是他自己說：「我也做記者吧，我可也眞羨慕你們記者先生的生活，我將是大公報的記者，名字是楊華白。」從此，我們在他沒有被共軍發現市長以前，我們都叫他「老楊」，連我們的傭人和警士，都呼他爲「楊先生」，一時換口，總有些不慣，總會漏出「市長」那個字樣！</p>
<p>突過火綱回寓</p>
<p>十六日黎明的時候，槍聲打遠了，吶喊的殺聲，也聽不見了。劉隊長報吿我們：「現在共軍已退到國務院了。」推開門窗，走到院子裏，晨光分外淸新，依舊是那般寗靜，枝頭小鳥，正在歡欣歌唱。</p>
<p>這時的槍聲，在城北打得更緊了。我們知道城北是火車站，爭奪火車站是戰略上交通和補給的要點。一個你死我活的殊死戰，或者說拉鋸戰，是意想得到的事情。我們用電話向住在中央銀行的竹舟聯絡，他說：「昨天下午四時一度爲共軍佔領，現在是在爭奪中」。我們知道美國大使館的武官芮克少校，是住在火車站旁邊的大和旅館內，我們擔心他的安全，用電話向他說話，可是電話已完全失去效用了。</p>
<p>在這個時候，西面宮內府的共軍，已打進市區了。我們在洋台上看，西面有三處起大火，我們知道這是福順厚，天興福兩製麵粉廠起火。這是十七日上今五時起火的。</p>
<p>趙君邁依舊有這個和平的勇氣，他和合衆社貝克特德，國際社艾伯娜二人，先至中央銀行。十一時劉隊長說：「國務院的保安隊退下來了」。當時守衛的警士，都準備向中央銀行逃退。趙君邁這時，又不在這裏，我們只得携了東西，帶了劉隊長，先向中央銀行問趙的意見。</p>
<p>趙可也忙得不了，在電話間裏，向西飛機塲共軍方面的陳靜華秘書通話。陳靜華同意停戰，但他要求趙轉陳家珍司令，先放下武器，再談別的事情。趙和陳談了一刻，陳毅然拒絕了共方的要求。我們這時知道長春的命運是注定了。</p>
<p>我們很直率底問陳家珍：「有什麽把握支持這個戰局」？他說：「熊主住有電報來，新一軍在十五日已通過四平街」。陳的面部表情，非常森冷，最後他吐出一句；「我只有死守核心障地」。</p>
<p>趙君邁看到和平絕望了。是　了綫的風箏，隨風而去了·他要我們即刻回去·人多擠在一輛車子裏，有差東西一時趕不及帶圖去·我們沿大同大街向大同廣塲的市政府定去·我因爲人多，想是第二次車子回來，可是這以後就沒有車了，機關槍像雨點那般的向我們那輛車子射擊，構成火網，交通遮斷。趙君邁要我們在市政府躱避，司機也不願意再向前走，我們站在市政府的面前，眼見傷兵一批批的退回來，合衆社貝克特和國際社艾伯娜都願意回去，世洵也贊同這險走回去。趙看見大家都想回特派員公署，於是決定再敎司機前駛，五分鐘後，我們終於安然歸來。可是發現車輪和車尾中了四五槍。</p>
<p>看到共軍動態</p>
<p>上午十一時左右（十七日），兒，運輸機在市上空不斷的繞圈兒，劉隊長說：「天空裏有降傘部隊下來了」。我們跑出去看，支加哥日報記者惠勒用照相機出去攝影，傘影下降到某一個程度時，我們才知是投的彈藥，一時保安隊士氣大振，槍聲四起，這是第一次的投彈，所有的彈藥，都投到保安隊的大同廣塲附近的陣心內。</p>
<p>午後一時許，飛機又來了，那時風向很大，所投的彈藥，都幾乎完全丢在共軍的陣地裏，事實上保安隊的陣地也愈打愈小，核心陣地附近的激戰，也就在這個時候開始·</p>
<p>也就在這個時候，保安隊都退出我們居所的附近。我們的居所，隨時成了拉鋸戰爭奪的所在地，我們知這隨時有危險來臨。趙君邁十分敏感，他首先敎警士都換便衣，把所有的槍和手溜彈，都埋到煤層裏。表明我們的居所，是個中立性的所在地，沒有戰鬥的行爲。屋上有中美國旗，門上有中外記者寓所的牌子。</p>
<p>下午四時許，我們從玻璃窗外，看見約模一連人的共軍，坐在對面房十的墻下休息，他們穿的黃布棉軍裝，世洵看見有幾個共軍走到我們居所的面前，大約是在看記者寓所的字樣，隨後也就走了。趙君邁就說：「我看我們不會出什麽大亂子，共軍還算理智。」果然，共軍沒有把我們的大門敲開。</p>
<p>我們安心在我們的小天地裏，依舊是十分平靜。晚飯比往日更覺美，餐後並有罐頭菠蘿吃。大家說這廚司愈做愈好，眞不愧爲吳子玉大帥的名廚，趙君邁舉手分麵包，像基督分他最後一次的聖餐一樣，他說：「今晚的美餐，我們痛快吃完吧，也許這是我們最後的一餐！」我們每個人的心田裏，都有一種不同的感覺，我們不知說什麽話才好，我們更不知用什麼心情來慰籍自己。大家沉靜了半響，最後圍住圓桌，高聲慨歌！</p>
<p>這天晚上，美國記者還是睡在樓下，世洵和江西正氣日報的楊卓之，市長，則睡在地下室內。常時我們還想也許午夜裏保安隊會出擊反攻過來還有一塲大戰。</p>
<p>夜深十一時半，我們因爲沉浸在幾大的惡戰裹，精神困倦萬分，所以劉隊長來喚醒我們的時候，大家都起不起床。後來他說：「八路已經來了。」我們突然驚醒，但見有十幾個穿黃布軍裝，頭戴皮帽子，槍上亮亮利刀的面目猙獰的八路戰士。（共軍稱士兵爲戰士），首先問話的一個排長是呌張正昌，我們吿訴他我們是新聞記者，趙君邁所僞裝的大公報記者楊華白，也在這時開始應用了。</p>
<p>張正昌起先表示驚擾我們，後來說明要借房子住宿。我們中美記者大家商量了一下，決定了兩個原則：（一）此地是記者寓所，僅允暫借一宵；（二）樓上全部不得佔用，樓下准借三間。張正昌都同意接受我們的原則，於是世洵和麥德生住棋上東廂，楊華白和卓之住中麻，惠動一人單住西廂·樓下一大間則由李音曼，員克特，艾伯娜三人合睡，他們都在地板上·</p>
<p>次日（十八日）早晨，艾伯娜醒來，發現她左右睡的盡是共軍她心裏滿不高典。她說：「這是我第一次和男人睡覺。」我們原定的兩個原則，規定樓下半男三個房間，事實共軍佔了五個半房間。張正昌說：「實在因為幾天作戰，弟兄沒有好睡！」</p>
<p>廚可說：「我們的米都給八路佬昨夜吃光了！」我們直到上午十一時還是空着肚皮。找共軍一個姓郭的營政治指導員說話，他答應歸還，於是我們得恢復我們的午飯。</p>
<p>郭政治指導員一口山東口音也和大多數的共軍一樣的山東口音，他承認在八一五以後，由山東步行來的，也有從烟台轉海來的他同我們談話的時候，不斷的注視手中長春市圖，我們看他繪畫的方面，正是中央銀行的區域，槍聲是從四個方面朝中央銀行攻　。</p>
<p>共軍蜂湧而去</p>
<p>下午二時，住在我們屋子裏的共軍，蜂湧而去，我們自已打掃房屋，揩刷桌几，我們得覺這是我們的家，我們喜歡它。</p>
<p>黃昏六時，外面叩門之聲，急如星火。世洵和惠勒出去開門，一共有五個共軍，兩個人手持機槍，三個人身佩手槍，請他們客廳裏坐，其餘的都下樓同他們談，只有趙君邁偽裝的大公報記者楊華白，稱病臥床不起。</p>
<p>共軍說明攻擊長春是整個國內問題，蘇聯把主權交給政府是外交問題。這兩件事根本不能混爲一談。其次，他又表示了蔣主席是中國的領袖，假使他能眞正施行民主，完成聯合政府。</p>
<p>那時砲火特別密集，幾乎在一分鐘內，發砲十數響。我們問孫正：「這砲是不是向中央銀行發射的。」他點點頭，表示是事實。「那麼，這個戰鬥一開，什麼時候可以解決？」我們又繼續追問下去。</p>

<h3 id="c110">晚宋九大民族詩人 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>關於晚宋的民族詩人，首先要說的是三位進士，那就是：許月卿，他是淳祐進士；眞山民，他是宋末進士；梁棟，他是咸淳進士。</p>
<p>許月卿是婺源人，曾任濠州司戶參軍，叱責奸相賈似道，不遺餘力。元軍下錢塘後，他就深居一室不出，自號泉田子。做了五年（也有說十年的）的啞子，一句話也不說，那就是說，算他是死了；其實這比死還難受。當詩人家稱山屋先生。他一直到死，都不曾說過一句話。雖然這是消極的抵抗，他的氣節卻是值得佩服的。謝枋得就很佩服他，曾經在他的門上題了一副對聯：「要看今日謝枋得，便是當年許月卿」。許氏的詩集名呌「先天集」，二冊，有商務四部業刊本。三年前我因了這兩本書引起興趣，讀後曾寫了一篇文章在「宇宙風」上發表。</p>
<p>眞山民是因為有人提起他的祖先西山，纔斷定他姓眞的。宋亡以後他就隱居了。也有人說他是括蒼人，本來名呌桂芳。</p>
<p>梁棟原籍湘江，移居鎭江，曾任錢塘縣尉。宋亡以後，他的弟弟梁柱入茅山學老衲，棟跑去依靠他。棟著有「梁隆吉時鈔」。三年前載在「宇宙風」「」上也寫了一篇「梁棟的詩」，這一篇和「許月卿的詩」都寫得較遲，所以不曾收在拙編「民族文學小史」（世界版）裏面。</p>
<p>其次要說到兩位詩人兼藝術豕：一位是會彈琴的汪元量，還有一位是會畫蘭的鄭風肖。</p>
<p>汪元量不僅會賦詩彈琴，還曾寫小詞，他著有「湖山類稿」等。杭州西冷印社似曾出有他的詩詞專集，綫裝二冊，他以彈琴為謝太后所知。杭州城破，謝太后與許多宮人被擄，他是跟着同船去的。在船上他看見有的宮人頗知愛國，終日飲泣；有的宮人卻塗脂抹粉，唱歌跳舞，希望將來能得元主的寵愛。他目擊當時宮人的日常行事，像做宮詞或竹枝詞似的，連續的做了許多首七言絕句。如果說阮籍的重要著作是若干首「詠懷」詩，那末汪元量的重要著作便是若干首放在「宋詩鈔」他的集于卷首的宮詞了。他到了燕都，元帝問他是否想做官，他說他願做道士。從此他就雲遊四方，尤以去廬山之時為最多，有人看見他行踪飄忽，有如飄風行雲，眞是翩翩欲仙呢。他臨行時有一位金德淑吟詩道：「萬里倦行役，秋來搜幾分；因看河北月，忽憶海東雲。」她愈是望河北的月亮，恐怕愈加想念海東杭州宮殿上的雲彩吧？可是，她已經跋涉萬里，離開杭州太遠了！秋天是最易感懷的，撫今追昔，怎能不使她消瘦幾分呢！王儀與汪元量的關係當然尤切。張聲玠的「琴別」（見清人雜劇二集）即寫二人之事。拙著讀曲隨筆面二一二說：「琴別敘宋末元初的詞人汪元量彈琴與十四女道士訣別。最近郁達夫正預備亟印他的水雲樓詞。吳梅云：琴別析亦較心餘冬青樹勝。」</p>
<p>戴思肖任何行事都不忘宋室。即以他的名字別號說，「思肖」就是思趙，「所南」就是永遠懷念的南方的杭州，「憤翁」也是憶宋室的意思。他住的地方，掛了條　，上寫道「木穴世界。」「本」字去下面的「十」字，「穴」字加上本字所去掉的「十」字，便成「宋」字。換句話說，「本」字的「十」字移下來。放在「穴」字上，便成「大宋」二字。同樣，他寫了一部書，名叫「大無工十空經」。什麼呌做「無工十空」呢，「空」字「無工，」便成「穴」字；「穴」再加「十」，仍是「宋」字。所以，大「無工十空經」就是「大宋經」。他所以要這樣轉灣抹角，當然是為了宋亡以後，怕觸犯文綱，方纔這樣隱晦其詞。他住在蘇州，無事時就繪畫消遣。他最喜歡畫蘭花。漢奸知府請他畫，就是對他磕頭喊老子也沒有用，惹起他的性子來，反把知府罵一頓弄得滿面羞慚而去。但是，可愛的鄉民請他畫，只要趁他出去時偷偷地在他的桌子上放一張紙，再擺上一壺好酒幾碟菜，他一面喝酒，吃一點菜，一面高起興來，就提筆在紙上颶颶地畫起蘭花來了。不過他畫的蘭花很奇怪。別人所畫的蘭花都有根，惟有他的畫的蘭花沒有根。人家問他：「畫蘭為什麼不畫根？」他就慨歏着說：「根已經被外人捆去了！等到我們收復失地，再來添上根吧！」平時他總是朝南坐着，過時過節，他也一定要向着南方哭。他用鐵箱盛着他的詩稿「心史」，藏在承天寺的井裏，因此名呌「井中心史」，又叫做「鐵面心史」。直到崇禎十一年，這部心史方纔被發現。再到民國初年，鄧實等辦國學扶輪社，方纔用油光紙把這部「心史」鉛印了出來，僅一冊。</p>
<p>最後要說到四棵冬青樹，也就是清蔣士銓（心餘）所寫的「冬青樹」傳奇中的四個重要人物，那就是：謝翱·林景熙·謝枋得和文天祥。「冬青樹」即由此取義。另一方面是說林景熙。文天祥和二謝好像「冬青樹」一樣的性格，能受風霜雨雪的侵蝕，仍是兀然獨立，永茂不凋。惟蔣氏謂景熙後得冥報，未免蛇足。景熙有「白石樵唱」六卷，「林霄山集」五卷，卻以「冬青行」一詩最為著名。此詩極晦澀難解，記得國學扶輪社刊有「冬青行注」。程敏政的「宋遺民錄」（筆記小說大觀本，文明書局刊行）中好像也有一卷注釋。明季卜世臣曾替林氏此事寫過一本「冬青記」傳奇，惜已失傳。</p>
<p>謝枋得與文天祥是同鄉，也是江西人，籍貫是信州。為人豪爽，看起書來，五行俱下，看後終身不忘。人家與他談起國事來，他每每掀髯抵幾，跳躍自奮。他是被品評為「驚鶴摩霄，不可籠　」的。他自從辦民團，抗元帥，在信州失敗以後，就在福建建陽隱居，賣卜為生，只取鞋·米·不收銀錢。「疊山集」（商務四部叢刊本二冊）中好幾首謝贈鞋·謝贈米的詩，大概都是這個時期寫的。宋亡以後，他不願出山。漢奸程文海偏要多年，一定要強迫他出來，把他像綁票一　地綁了去，他只好途中絕食，僅吃水果，終於餓死在北京的憫忠寺。</p>
<p>最後的一天文天祥知道的人很多，可以不必詳敘。他的一生事蹟，已見宋史卷四一八。現代關於文天祥的作品極多。商務·世界都覆印「文天山全集」，楊蔭深旣寫「文天祥年譜」（商務），又寫話劇「文天祥」。吳祖光也寫了一本話劇「正氣歌」。楊作考證史實，煞費苦心，惜無演出効果，不便演出，即由於過拘史實之故；吳作多與正史不合，我在上海劇藝社曾演講一次，專評此作，但吳演出的効果卻極好。鄭振鐸旣在世界文庫一集重排「指南錄」，又取這題材寫了一篇小說「桂公塘」，連初中國文讀本都把這篇小說選了進去，流傳頗廣。其他如章衣萍易君左所寫的通俗讀物「文天祥」傳記，更能深入大眾。聽說「正氣歌」已譜成新歌譜，那末具傳播就更廣遠了。我在這兒只說一件軼事：文天祥在海豐五城嶺被捕，（因為是正在吃飯時候被捕的，所以後來該處建了一個方飯亭，海豐中學就建造在那兒，二十年前，我在那兒敎過半年書）張弘範要他寫信招張世傑來，他不肯與，逼得急了，他只寫出兩句「過零丁洋」的舊作；「人生自古誰無死，留取丹心照汗青！」張弘範無法可想，惟有苦笑而已。</p>
<p>上面的九位詩人，大部分在「宋詩鈔」（商務國學基本叢書本）第四冊裏都有不少詩選在裏面，「知人」以後，要想再欣賞他們的詩，那末看這一本書是最方便而且容易得到的。我在「民族文學史」（世界）裏介紹後面七位的詩句，也可供我們參考。還有正中書局所出「晚宋民族詩研究」，那也是一本好書。</p>

<p>江湖老了，</p>
<p>人世卻漸感陌生。</p>
<p>長輩的笑貌渺不可尋，</p>
<p>懷中的孩子推開了我們。</p>
<p>「努力」的足步，</p>
<p>竟走近人生的荒邊，</p>
<p>我亦漸有窮途浪子的吝意，</p>
<p>手中的歲月所餘無幾。</p>

<p>餘燼是一堆哀愁。</p>

<p>— 林雲</p>
<p>微雨的流蘇里溜走了幾許寂寞的時辰，多少生命的光輝褪色了，在失去燦爛的四月天，更有誰經得起心的雨季呢？</p>
<p>四月的風輕輕的迷濛，雖然那沒有雲的天空是一片青灰，沒有落日的姹紅；也沒有晚霞的綺艷，而黃昏的微雨下，躑躅着，像是讀一頁憂怨的小詩，淡淡的，會讓你懂得更多的思緒！</p>
<p>且不要說話，靜靜的看那波浪徐徐的起伏，那時候，就彷彿聽着一曲玄幻的樂章，你會了解生活顛簸的意義，誰的生命中能有一條寬平的坦道呢？歲月里有春天也有秋天，有着充滿陽光的日子也有飄着咸雨的時辰，雖然人們都喜悅無限歡笑，可是誰也不能抗拒凄幽的哭泣，縱然能以強裝的笑顏欺騙別人，但永遠是欺騙不了自己的，否則就不會覺得心靈的懲罰是太殘酷了。</p>
<p>絲線細的雨絲，密密的飄灑着，這種穆然的境界里，沉默更能感到一點親切，當江風帶來一聲聲舒緩的晚鐘時，心靈上就會在不覺間浮起一片白色的宗教感，你會低下頭，跌落在遼遠的沉思里，那是一片浩瀚的海。有多少過去，有多少未來，記憶間有童年的嬉笑，有青春的愛戀，然而記憶也會還給你一點辛酸和一點凄涼，若是記憶給了你太重的擔負，你也許會垂下雨的淚了。</p>
<p>人是生活在希望與失望之間，生活在回憶與童憬之間，許多往事會引起穆穆的懷想，可是許多新的希望又會引起無限的遐思，然而希望總是朦朧的像是黃昏江上的雨景，有一層輕霧籠罩着，那末漠漠……</p>
<p>江畔，微雨的黃昏里，能獲得更式深邃的啓示，會了解自己，同時也會了解人生，人生就會像微雨一樣的飄忽，可是不要太憂傷了，雖然今天有過微雨，有過一抹薄薄的哀愁，也許在明天，在溫煦的陽光下會獲得無限的歡笑，但是，且莫忘了今朝的微雨。</p>

<p>— 陳仲陶</p>
<p>雨脚高低飄萬弩。芭蕉解作翩躚舞。疏檽風入一燈搖。夢聽菰蒲春雁語。酒冷香銷夢復醒。江湖影事太零星。不眠自愛聽更柝。明日杏花知滿城。</p>
<h3 id="c114">熟悉的喊聲 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>

<p>窗外，「白糖梅子」的喊聲又起了。</p>
<p>八年來，流落在西南的小城市裏，那裏沒有這熟悉的聲音。因此，每當暮春季節，緬懷地起了鄉愁時，便想起家園的梅林，大概已是滿枝青梅了吧？於是，耳邊又悠悠地飄起了「白糖梅子」的喊聲。</p>
<p>去秋歸來，先去看看梅林是否無恙，但，野草沒脛，一片荒蕪，早已找不到一些梅樹的殘枝了！</p>
<p>失去了梅林，我並不覺得痛心悲傷，因為那時勝利初臨，我的內心燃燒着更大的歡愉之火。</p>
<p>但，漸漸地，這歡愉變成了失望，國內紛爭如此，民生凋疲如此……。</p>
<p>因此，當這熟悉的喊聲又在耳邊響起的時候，除了有一陣親切之感以外，又覺得無限的感傷；勝利的味兒，還不是和白糖梅子一樣，外面包了一層甜蜜的糖衣，內裏依舊是辛酸。</p>
<h3 id="c115">牡丹和鳳凰 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>

<p>記得小時候，一位老師說過：「富麗堂皇的牡丹不見得強似水上的那些青萍，而一隻司晨的雄鷄的建比百烏之王的鳳凰來得高明。」我不懂得像寓言似的謎語，但是我真心誠意的崇拜那位老師，所以他的話一直謹謹的記在心裏，直到今天。</p>
<p>我不敢說我現在是比以前聰明了（因為我永遠是愚笨的），但是至少稍為解事一點，比小時候。參觀過化學實騐室的人，將不會再驚奇一張樹葉如何能變成美麗的書簽，二十歲歲自然比十歲左右時知道更多一點社會上的情形。為什麼？這社會是那樣的不如人意？是呈現着極端的畸形？一面是冷落與黑暗，沒有亮；一面卻是異樣的熱鬧，體面，風光。為什麼呢？也許這是個謎，但是有一點卻必須承認：當前的社會上，大人物實在不少，而所成就的大事業卻實在是太不多。</p>
<p>「要立志做大事，不要做大官。」國父說過這樣的話，一個多麼語短心長的敎訓！我想我們所處的社會裏，牡丹和鳳凰實在是太多，太多了。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>關於約墨太太到北京來這一層，翁二太太事前並沒有告訴石玉樓，翁二太太是請石玉樓的一位私人琴師寫的信。倒不是翁二太太存心要瞞石玉樓，而是翁二太太覺得這件事是她和墨太太的事，沒有必要非徵求石玉樓的同意不可。而且，石玉樓似乎也沒有工夫聞問這件事。再說，石玉樓並不會識字寫字，則如告訴他，他同意了，他也不能代翁二太太辦這件事，所以，翁二太太就索興給獨裁了一次，但想不到在偶然的閒護下，被琴師說了出來，琴師問翁二太太為什麼　所請的客人還不來，沒有等到翁二太太回答，石玉樓便追問請了什麼客人？翁二太太這才不得不原原本本地講給他聽了。可是石玉樓惱了，他近來為了心情不好，事業不如意，脾氣變得特別暴燥。於是他責備翁二太太不該事前不告訴他，他的理由是他不喜歡客人，他在舞台上可以和許多人不得已而合羣，回到家裏，他只願一個人待着，他愛孤僻！翁二太太向他解釋她同翁二太太的關係，誇大地介紹墨太太的為人如何如何好，並說明墨太太是幫助她　石玉樓結合的功臣，但這些都不是以感動石玉樓，他對於墨太太根本沒有印象，所以她就毫無興趣。為了這件事，他們第一次爭吵了，雖然最後還是翁二太太屈服了，而心裏卻非常的不滿。她人為石玉樓那裏是在作她的丈夫，簡直是在作她的皇上！石玉樓的專制，漸漸使她感到不安！感到壓迫！她也了解石玉樓經濟不寬裕的苦衷，可是她曾把自己的一些體已，都拿出來幫助了石玉樓。自然石玉樓每月的包銀只有兩百元，兩百元是不夠她吃飯和吸煙用的。由於這原故，翁二太太以為石玉樓是怕墨太太來了增加他的負担。其實，翁二太太自己明白，墨太太是不會累他們的，以墨太太也許還會幫助他們。因此，翁二太太更希望墨太太能到北京來，而且希望她快點來。無論在精神上，生活上，她都迫切地需要墨太太。但這些，她不願向石玉樓多說。</p>
<p>在一個薄暮的晚上，翁二太太打發了石玉樓上戲園子裏去後。心裏正寂寞得慌，忽然外面一陣鬧哄哄，驚動她連忙走出大門一看，原來墨太太和　華麗雲他們到了！這一下，翁二太太簡直樂得跳起來！她扑過去一把拉住了墨太太的手說：</p>
<p>「姐姐，你可來了！盼得我的眼快盼穿了！」</p>
<p>翁二太太又招呼了麗華，麗雲，特別是看見麗雲，一陣心酸，呌了聲「乖」，眼淚便奪眶而出！</p>
<p>「妹妹！你怎麼變成這樣了？要不是你先喊我，我幾乎不敢認你了！墨太太端詳了翁二太太一會兒，第一句話便射擊到翁二太太的傷心處。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Guo-Gong Agreement to Resume Talks; Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Subgroup Expected to Reopen This Weekend; Zhang Qun Arrives in Shanghai to Urge Representatives to Go to Nanjing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] After the Morning Post published Special Envoy Marshall's earnest statement on the current situation yesterday, the heavy atmosphere in Nanjing gradually dissipated. People in Nanjing, both Chinese and foreign, expressed their admiration for Special Envoy Marshall's unwavering determination to achieve peace in China. Sensitive observers generally believe that the overall situation will become clearer with the new developments in the military situation in the Northeast. Therefore, reopening the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting to openly discuss the issues at hand is particularly timely. It is reported that this morning, after Shao Lizi and Wang Shijie held talks, Shao and PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen jointly hosted a luncheon for CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao at the National Assembly Hall at one o'clock in the afternoon. At that time, the two sides gradually approached a consensus on reopening the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting, and the door to serious political negotiations will slowly open.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Shao Lizi told our reporter tonight that the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting, formerly the Guo-Gong talks, can begin on the 22nd. The government and CCP representatives have agreed to meet on the 22nd. The government representatives Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Cui, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie, and the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Li Weihan will all attend. If government representative Zhang Qun cannot make it from Shanghai in time, another person will be sent to participate in the talks. It is understood that the government representatives of the PCC who went to Shanghai will soon accompany the PCC representatives from the Democratic League and the Youth Party to Nanjing. After the representatives arrive in Nanjing, the date of the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting can be determined. It is possible that the meeting will be held this weekend.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Government PCC representative Shao Lizi and PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen hosted a luncheon on the 21st for CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, and Li Weihan, and invited Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng to accompany them. However, Zhang Lisheng did not attend due to other matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Government PCC representative Wu Tiecheng visited CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan at Meiyuan New Village on the morning of the 21st. It is said that Wu's visit was a return visit.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Xie Zhen, and others visited Chang Naihui, the China Youth Party representative of the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup, today to discuss the resumption of peace talks. The government seems to have begun to break the current political deadlock. Yesterday afternoon, Chang had talks with government and Communist Party representatives. At the same time, General Marshall will meet with National Assembly representatives this afternoon to hear their opinions on the current situation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Marshall Meets with Zhou Enlai; Earnestly Hopes Both Sides Will Stop the Propaganda War <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] At ten o'clock this morning, Zhou Enlai drove to Special Envoy Marshall's residence at 5 Ninghai Road for further talks lasting about two hours. It is reported that after listening to Zhou's statement of the CCP's latest demands, Marshall explained the necessity of strengthening the authority of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters with a fair and earnest attitude. Marshall affirmed that only by increasing the prestige of the Executive Headquarters can the work of military mediation not be in vain. Marshall also reiterated his sincere hope that both the Guo-Gong parties would stop the propaganda war. It is reported that Yu Dawei was also present during Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai today. The meeting lasted two hours and seventeen minutes. The four and a half hours of talks at Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road and the regular meeting room of the National Assembly were the most active and concrete consultations of the PCC since the return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] CCP leader Zhou Enlai and Special Envoy Marshall held a two-hour meeting today to discuss the Northeast issue and maintaining peace within China. The two also reviewed the huge plan to divert the Yellow River to restore its pre-war course. The CCP has established a concrete agreement for this huge project, which will include residents of the CCP border area. The details of the talks were not released, but it was announced that the talks would resume tomorrow. This was Zhou's first meeting since last week, when the talks were interrupted due to his illness. He has now apparently fully recovered. Zhou will also meet with the new Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei tomorrow to discuss a truce in the psychological warfare in domestic propaganda.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The presidium of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee nominated representatives Zhang Jingyu, Hu Ding'an, Zhang Daoxing, Ta Yifeng, and Sun Yichang, accompanied by Zhou Shennong, head of the National Assembly Committee's reception section, to meet with General Marshall at noon on the 21st to exchange views on the current situation. Marshall frankly explained the current situation and expressed his willingness to make his best efforts to promote China's peace and unification.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Special Envoy Marshall issued a blunt warning yesterday about the Guo-Gong parties engaging in propaganda that promoted hatred and suspicion without reservation. According to sources close to Marshall, Special Envoy Marshall has spent painstaking efforts in Nanjing and Chongqing for weeks mediating peace with various parties, but the propaganda of the Guo-Gong parties has made the situation more chaotic. Marshall had no choice but to make this direct expression, but it was the first time he had publicly criticized both the Guo-Gong parties. The Ministry of Propaganda had originally drafted a reply to Marshall's statement and submitted it to the Central News Agency for publication, but later withdrew it. The Central government said that the party hoped to have a news agency to engage in propaganda warfare, but since the party has no newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai, Marshall's criticisms do not apply to the party.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Special Envoy Marshall expressed his opinion yesterday, criticizing both the Guo-Gong parties for engaging in propaganda warfare, he met with Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Zhou Enlai one after another today. At the same time, various newspapers have also responded to Marshall's words yesterday.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Anhui Provincial Provisional Assembly and the Association of Fellow Provincials in Beijing hosted the press at 3:00 PM this afternoon. First, Cheng Xuming, a member of the Provisional Assembly, reported on the disaster situation in thirteen counties in northeastern Anhui (Sixian, Suxian, Lingbi, Sihuo, Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Zhuoshan, Xuyi, Chuxian, Lai'an, Tianchang, and Dingyuan). He stated that after the northeastern Anhui region was ravaged by the enemy, it fell to the Communist army. Six of the thirteen counties were occupied by the Communist army, and important towns in the other seven counties were also captured by the Communist army. The Communist Party launched a struggle between the rich and the poor in this region, implemented various perverse policies, and forcibly conscripted young men. The people, unable to bear the disturbances, rich and poor alike, fled with their families. Currently, there are more than two million refugees in northern Anhui and along the Yangtze River and the Shanghai-Nanjing area. This situation is still developing, and the number of refugees will increase day by day. These refugees are concentrated in Bengbu, Mingguang, and other places, where they are most numerous. Because they have all been exploited by the Communist army, all their property has already been looted. Therefore, they are homeless and without food or clothing. The Provisional Assembly, seeing the severity of the disaster situation, specially sent Assemblyman Cheng and others to Beijing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, making five requests: (1) Increase relief supplies, (2) Establish relief stations, (3) Provide small loans, (4) Build refugee dormitories, and (5) Establish refugee complaint offices. After Cheng's report, Director Ye of the Anhui Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Anhui National Assembly representatives Qiu Xisheng and Li Xianying, and Senator Shen Shixiong, among others, gave reports. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 21st] Xiang Zhaoxuan, Dean of the Law School of National Hubei University, went to the south gate for business at noon on the 19th.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] According to transportation circles, after the Communist army's destructive activities on the Jin-Yu section of the Beining Railway were frustrated, their main target seemed to have shifted to the Pan-Jin section. Following the destruction of four holes in the No. 50 bridge in Liuhegou on that section, more than 10,000 Communist troops were discovered yesterday north of Xiaoliangshan, the old line of Yutai Mountain Xinlitu Village. At the same time, more than 10,000 people were also discovered in Zhoutuozi, forty miles northwest of Baiqibao. A large number of Communist troops were also concentrated north of Xinmin.

After Prosecutor Li announced the execution order and asked if he had a will, Miao looked calm, took out two letters, one addressed to his parents and the other to his wife, and instructed the prison servants to inform Zhang Ma, who lived at No. 3 Nanxuelong, Cang Street, Suzhou, to stop sending food. At 5:15 PM, the prosecutor ordered Miao to kneel in the center of the execution ground. Miao repeatedly shouted "Die for the country" incessantly. The bailiff executed the sentence, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth, killing him instantly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Supreme Court's review ruling was only delivered to the traitor Miao's cell in the No. 3 Prison at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Traitor Miao was still unaware that death was imminent, so he wrote to his defense lawyer, Ji Fusheng, asking him to come to the prison for a visit to discuss other methods. In the original letter, there was a sentence, "Please quickly inform the above-mentioned Committee Member of the detailed situation," which presumably referred to directing his family to directly seek help from the Chairman. The reporter read the full text of the Supreme Court's ruling, which deeply condemned Miao for enticing Li Changjiang to surrender to the puppet regime. Although Miao had new counter-evidence, he ultimately could not escape death. This point was the main reason. The so-called law values being neither unjust nor lenient. Even if Miao had minor merits, it could not cover up his guilt.</p>

<p>Ordered to Raise Funds to Purchase Second Phase of Military Grain</p>
<p>The county government was ordered to raise funds to purchase military grain in the second phase, and the regulations of the organizing committee for raising funds for military grain were promulgated. The county government immediately started preparations and hired Ju Yusansan and ten other people as committee members. It was established yesterday, but recently the price of rice has exceeded 50,000, making it quite difficult to raise funds for military grain.</p>
<p>Welfare Association Distributes Old Clothes on Behalf of Others The County Relief Association entrusted the Welfare Association of Public and Educational Personnel to distribute old clothes to public and educational personnel.

<p>The establishment of tap water in Wuxian County is being actively prepared and has progressed to a considerable stage. Although the mechanical water pipes are supplied by the Good Rescue Headquarters, the factory site has been designated to be rebuilt from the agricultural tool manufacturing plant outside Xumen. The capital is also planned to be at least 100 million yuan, with 70% public shares and 30% private shares, raised through the Baojia method. The labor will be utilized by prisoners.

<p>Dongshan Primary School is in urgent need of rescue. The county-owned primary schools in Dongshan District are now facing a new measure decreed by the county government, requiring them to bear half the regular monthly expenses of the schools themselves, and half from the Education Department in tandem with the location in which the school is located. As of the start of the new semester, only half of the funding for monthly expenses has been issued from the Education Department, while funding from localities remains on paper for the past four months, rendering payment impossible to execute. As such, the instructors have elected to strike uniformly in the form of filing a grievance with the district office. Consequently, an agreement was reached to appropriate a portion of the income stemming from fruits and produce of this year; however, that harvesting period remains a faraway prospect, and cannot satiate those of whom are starving. A telegram has been sent to associations from Dongshan residing in Shanghai for a prompt influx of capital.

<h3 id="e31">Marshall's Special Envoy's Warning <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Marshal Marshall issued his first official press statement in Beijing since arriving in China, pointing out that the malicious propaganda of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, spreading suspicion and jealousy, has further deteriorated the already serious situation. The result is that the Chinese people will suffer great disasters. The work of the mediation executive group is particularly difficult due to this propaganda deeply penetrating the officers and soldiers of both sides, and whether the struggle in China can be stopped or at least localized depends on the efforts of the mediation executive group. Since his arrival, Special Envoy Marshall has been working tirelessly to mediate, and the Chinese people sincerely express their gratitude and expectation for this five-star Marshal's diligent work day and night. Marshal Marshall is an outstanding military statesman. Since arriving in China, he has been down-to-earth and hardworking, not indulging in empty talk. This spirit is especially admired by the Chinese people. The document issued in Beijing yesterday was Marshal Marshall's first official press release since arriving in China, aimed at pointing out that malicious propaganda only breeds hatred and suspicion, further deteriorating the situation and making the work of the mediation executive group difficult. We cannot help but express our sympathy for Marshal Marshall's statement. Indeed, the role of malicious propaganda is only to sting emotions and increase hatred and suspicion, making the situation increasingly worse. Propaganda that only stings emotions is not only of no help to the overall situation but is also extremely harmful. We deeply admire Marshal Marshall's outstanding insight in raising this point in his first official press release since arriving in China. Since Marshal Marshall's statement mentioned that the harm of malicious propaganda would cause great disasters to the Chinese people, standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, we would like to briefly express our views.</p>
<p>First, the Chinese Communist Party, like communist parties in other parts of the world, is a master of propaganda, and they use various methods to devote themselves to their propaganda. Not to mention anything else, just looking at the Xinhua Daily published in Chongqing, one can know how they are launching their propaganda strategy. The American warships transporting the National Army to the Northeast is a kind of rumor that one ally supports another, either saying that the US military is participating in China's "civil war" or that the US military is attacking the Communist army. All this is for the original purpose of the Communist Party, and there is no need to elaborate. Looking at the past facts, the Communist army launches a propaganda offensive after occupying a place, followed by practical action; the so-called "Central Plains War" is a clear proof. As for the Kuomintang side, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and restricted by the domestic and international situation, it never deigns to use propaganda offensives, at most only carrying out appropriate defenses when necessary. The Communist Party fabricates rumors excessively, and denies them when they are pointed out, but it has never launched propaganda offensives as frequently as the Communist Party; therefore, some people, including some foreigners, are quite dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's passive attitude. Therefore, the past expansion of propaganda was initiated by the Communist Party, and this is a point that must be raised regarding responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, since the previous malicious expansion of propaganda was initiated by the Communist Party, we sympathize with Marshal Marshall's statement, and to curb the continuation of this malicious propaganda, we must first hope that the Communist Party can abandon the propaganda strategy it has adopted in the past. What Marshal Marshall pointed out is correct, and our personal feelings are the same as Marshal Marshall's. To prevent the overall situation from deteriorating further, all malicious propaganda must be stopped. In the past, the Communist Party has worked hard to launch a propaganda offensive of jealousy and hatred, so to stop all malicious propaganda, the Communist Party must abandon its usual propaganda strategy. Therefore, we cannot help but feel regret for the word "both sides" used in Marshal Marshall's statement. It is clear that one side is using propaganda strategies, but the word "both sides" is used in Marshal Marshall's statement. This may be a necessary diplomatic rhetoric, but the result is enough to boost the arrogance of the Communist Party and achieve its propaganda attempts. Marshal Marshall, as a third party, is inconvenient to favor either side, but right and wrong must be distinguished, and responsibility must be clear. What's more, the Communist Party's actions are aimed at subverting the government. According to legal theory, one side is treason, and it cannot be mentioned in the same breath at all. Now there are "both sides".</p>
<p>Third, the Chinese people, especially those who have fled from the "Liberated Areas," generally have a deep understanding of the Communist Party and criticize the Communist Party; this is the people's will, and no government can suppress the people's thoughts and words, and China is no exception. The Communist Party's record in China is not something that any true Chinese can praise. The crimes of killing, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Chinese. It can be said that hatred of the Communist Party is the general feeling of the Chinese people. Although the Communist Party has its vast controlled areas, the rule of these areas is based on all its force, not on the hearts of the people. The percentage of true party members of the Chinese Communist Party in the total population of the country can be said to be extremely low—less than one percent, so the fate of China must not be determined by the Communist Party. The reason why the Communist Party has its current dominance is due to the fact that some foreign observers do not understand the intentions of the Chinese people and give it an excessive, inappropriate, or over-estimated evaluation. This situation must be corrected before China can have lasting stability.</p>
<p>I remember when Marshal Marshall first came to China, we hoped that Marshal Marshall would give the Chinese people at least what Lafayette gave the American people. Undoubtedly, the current situation in China cannot be compared with the situation in America at that time. This is a more difficult task, but with Marshal Marshall's talent and wisdom, there are no insurmountable difficulties. We hope for Marshal Marshall's success, China's lasting stability, and the world's lasting peace. The key to this lies entirely in this. We look forward to it so eagerly, that we cannot help but express it so earnestly.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Facts Speak Louder Than Words <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>In the past few days, the domestic political situation has been so dull that it seems to have entered a state of suspended animation. Although there are constant discussions about reopening peace talks and continuing negotiations, on the other hand, the drums of military conflict are loud, one wave after another. Although friendly people are running around and calling for help, doing their best to mediate, I am afraid that they may not be able to save the current critical situation, which is truly regrettable and hateful. Chinese and foreign newspapers have detailed the conflicts in various places, but yesterday we received a letter from Lu Dingyi, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that he denied some reports about the Chinese Communist Party issued by foreign journalists.</p>
<p>Although we people belong to the third party, we are still the masters of the country. At a time when the country is in a critical situation, we should not continue to be confused, not ask about the truth, and blindly shout to stop the civil war, without any sense of right and wrong; but we should raise our vigilance, face reality, keep our eyes open, and clearly see who is playing with soldiers and making trouble? Who wants to resolve it by force? And who should be responsible for the conflict?</p>
<p>We do not want to waste any more words, so-called facts speak louder than words, please see the following facts.</p>
<p>(1) In the Northeast, the Communist army blatantly disregarded the troop reorganization plan, using the name of the "Democratic Allied Army" to seize Changchun and Harbin with force, attempting to expand its territory and occupy the entire nine provinces of the Northeast, and would never let go. Now the Communist Party is chanting "unconditional ceasefire" in order to force the government and the mediation party to recognize its accomplished facts. Fortunately, the National Army has recovered Sipingjie yesterday, and the two cities of Changchun and Harbin are expected to be recovered within a week.</p>
<p>(2) In North China, war is even more widespread, with beacon fires everywhere. The Beining Road has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army, and it is covered with scars and unusable. Now the Communist army has transferred troops from Hebei and Chahar provinces to reinforce Rehe, launching a major offensive; in addition to occupying Beipiao, it has also attacked Chifeng, which is currently blocked by the National Army east of Chengde. In the Pingjin area, there is a sense of impending crisis, and it has been heavily surrounded by the Communist army. After the Communist army attacked Mentougou, it is only seventeen miles away from Beiping, causing panic among the people, and the city gates are closed early every night; Tianjin is also in the same state, within ten miles outside the city, there are traces of the Communist army, and everyone is on alert, making people even more panicked.</p>
<p>(3) In the northern section of the Jinpu Road, the clouds of war are also dense. The Communist army occupied Cangxian Bozhen, and the war was fierce, and the southern section is also in the midst of war.</p>
<p>(4) In Shanxi, the Communist army is fiercely attacking Shuoxian endlessly, and Datong is also feeling threatened.</p>
<p>(5) In Shandong, after the Communist army launched a major offensive, it successively occupied the two cities of Mingshui and Longshan. Although the ceasefire agreement in central Shandong has been established, who can guarantee that the Communist army will not attack again! Therefore, Jinan and Qingdao cannot be said to have turned the tide.</p>
<p>(6) In northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is ready to make trouble. The Communist army has been clamoring for attacking Yangtai Nantong and other cities for more than a day, and the refugee youth from northern Jiangsu are scattered all over the south of the Yangtze River and have become a large group of pitiful and helpless refugees. Who is to blame?</p>
<p>The above are all ironclad facts, which cannot be denied by a statement from the Communist representative. Also, yesterday Special Envoy Marshall warned both sides not to take malicious propaganda anymore. The Communist Party spokesman actually said that this was not directed at the Communist Party, and attempted to shirk the responsibility for malicious propaganda to others. Who can believe the words of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: The Security Council resumed its meeting in New York at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the Iranian issue. The Soviet representative did not attend. The Iranian representative submitted a report requesting that although Soviet troops should withdraw from Azerbaijan province before May 6, the Soviet Union has continued to interfere in the internal administration of Azerbaijan province in the past two weeks. As for whether Soviet troops have changed their uniforms and mixed in with the troops of Azerbaijan province, Iran cannot conduct an investigation. At the time of the broadcast, the meeting was still in progress.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 21st Telegraph] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to discuss the Iranian issue tomorrow. This issue originally had hope of being resolved soon, but now Iran has accused the Soviet Union of not stopping interfering in Iranian internal affairs, so the hope of resolution has become weak. According to a report submitted to the Security Council by Iran's ambassador to the United States, Arle, last night: If the rumors that armed conflicts have occurred in the strategic area of northern Iran are true, then international peace and security will obviously be seriously threatened immediately, but he has not received any news of conflicts between the central government army and the army of Azerbaijan province. So far, the Iranian government is still facing obstacles and cannot exercise its functions in Azerbaijan province, and the Soviet Union's interference in Iranian internal affairs has not stopped. At the same time, the Soviet Union's chief representative to the Security Council, Gromyko, has already stated that he will not attend tomorrow's Council meeting. This is the third time for Gromyko to take such action.</p>

He has telegraphed Dabriza to inquire. Su Blank Space Shen claimed: When I heard the report from the Dabriza radio station, I was extremely surprised. I have repeatedly stated that I will never use force against Azerbaijan province, so I expected that my troops in Blank Space Cort-Azerbaijan must not attack. I dare to assert that my troops will be able to obey the order, but in order to clarify the truth, I telegraphed Dabriza again yesterday to inquire. The reply telegram confirmed that a conflict had occurred, but I did not know who started it first. Today, I telegraphed again, and I also plan to send someone to the scene of the incident to meet with the Dabriza representative to restore order. I have done my best to maintain stability, and I will never let the conflict escalate. I believe that after the order is issued, the war has already stopped. Sadana continued: I will soon send a representative to Azerbaijan province to resume the negotiations that were interrupted in Tehran.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Iranian government also issued a statement, saying that it has ordered an immediate investigation into the rumors of conflict.</p>
<p>[United Press Tehran, 20th Telegraph] Tonight, the Dabriza radio station broadcasted that the Iranian government army had once again attacked the positions of the Azerbaijan army, and the civil war was continuing fiercely. But Iranian Prime Minister Sadana said that everything was just a small contact and had stopped. [United Press London, 21st Telegraph] According to the Tehran correspondent of the Telegraph, Tehran has received news that a large number of armed civilian teams in Dabriza have begun to launch a counter-revolutionary movement against the Azerbaijan government. This news has not been confirmed, but the Dabriza radio station announced a state of emergency throughout the province last night. The correspondent said: It is possible that the state of emergency was implemented for counter-revolutionary actions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, Twenty-Blank Space Day] The Dabriza radio station still claimed last night that Iranian and Azerbaijan provincial troops were at war, and the Iranian army was attacking again yesterday.

Coal Mines Will Also Be Taken Over by the Government. <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 20th Telegraph] After receiving an honorary degree in Missouri, President Truman has flown back to Washington, and the situation he is facing is extremely dangerous. According to Washington observers, this is one of the most critical times Truman has faced since taking office. The truce for the railway and bituminous coal strikes will expire around this Wednesday, and President Truman must provide some solutions to prevent a large-scale paralysis of national industry. The government has mobilized 250,000 train operators and locomotive personnel to launch a strike and take over the railways, but White House officials believe that a permanent solution will be negotiated before the expiration date. The outlook for resolving the bituminous coal workers' strike is also not very bright, and it is believed that if the negotiations fail this week, President Truman may take steps to have government agencies take over the coal mines. Congress is quite divided. This year is an election year for members of Congress, so most members are reluctant to excessively confront labor unions, for fear of hindering their own political future.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 20th Telegraph] Federal Mediation Commissioner McGrath announced today that if the coal mine strike is delayed, the government's next step will be to order the takeover of the coal mines. Any attempt to unite mine owners and workers will be ineffective.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Conference held its first meeting yesterday. Representatives from Brazil and Siam, among the invited countries, have arrived to participate, with only the Soviet Union and Argentina absent. Truman's Food Envoy Hoover attended and delivered a speech, offering several recommendations, stating briefly: To address the global food shortage, a new organization must be established, tentatively named the "United Nations Food Bureau." I propose: (1) Appoint a Director and a small advisory committee. (2) The majority of advisors should be representatives of grain-producing countries. (3) Establish Food Bureaus in certain regions, such as the South American Food Bureau and the Indian Ocean Food Bureau, the latter including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. (4) This organization should only operate during times of food shortage or post-war agricultural recovery. (5) This organization should take over UNRRA's food and agriculture activities starting on September 1st. (6) The newly established Food Bureau should merge the United Nations Food Board and other international organizations dealing with food affairs, engaging in the restoration of normal commerce and global food and agricultural product trade. It is believed that this organization will be able to serve farmers, merchants, and consumers better than individual governments. (7) Charitable distribution should cease immediately to allow for allocated distribution of food. (8) The Food Bureau should establish agreements with grain-producing countries, having the authority to allocate a portion of their grain, the quantity depending on the source of grain. Hoover concluded by saying that the first voice of war is the cannon, but the most powerful statement for creating peace is food.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Creating Peace Cannot Be Achieved Overnight; The US is Determined to Go All Out to Achieve Its Goals; Byrnes' Broadcast Address Targeted at the Soviet Union; The US Will Again Request a Peace Conference to Be Held in July <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Byrnes today broadcast to the nation and the world about the proceedings of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting [yesterday, this newspaper listened to a broadcast from San Francisco and briefly reported its content], stating briefly: The four foreign ministers' discussion of the draft peace treaties with European countries has had little success, which is disappointing. However, as a result of this exchange of views, mutual understanding has deepened, and this progress is greater than expected. Creating "peace among nations" is a long-term and difficult task that cannot be achieved overnight through diplomacy. It requires patience and determination, tolerance and understanding to succeed. We cannot force others to accept our will, but we must also make it clear that they cannot force us to accept their will.</p>
<p>Byrnes' wording today was aimed at the Soviet Union, saying: No major power can exercise a veto over the drafting of peace treaties. If a European peace conference is not convened this summer, the United States will appeal to the United Nations General Assembly to make recommendations. The United States adopted a "peace offensive" at the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting and will continue to go all out until its goals are achieved. Such a treaty is not based on revenge and greed, but on a just peace, which is the only lasting peace. The United States has three policy objectives: the implementation of the 25-year control plan for German industry, the rapid withdrawal of United Nations troops from Austria, and a peace conference for all countries that contributed to the victory in the European war, to be held on July 1st or 15th. I am determined to accomplish all of this. The purpose of the peace conference is to establish treaties with Italy, the Balkan countries, and Finland. This request was obstructed by the Soviet delegation, which insisted, based on the requirement of unanimous agreement on meeting procedures, that a peace conference could not be convened until all basic issues in the treaty were resolved. The Soviet Union's insistence on Italy paying reparations of one billion yuan is an example of what it considers a basic issue. The United States has spent tens of millions of dollars feeding Italians and must provide financial assistance to that country's economic recovery, and then pay reparations from Italy's economy. The United States does not want to repay loans in this way, but the United States has suggested another way to pay reparations, which the Soviet Union does not want. The United States proposed using part of the Italian fleet as reparations, but the Soviet Union insisted that this was their right to war booty. However, war booty has always been the property of defeated countries, and the Soviet Union has never proposed sharing any of its war booty with its allies.</p>
<p>Regarding the New Agreement with Italy, Britain Denies Secret Clauses</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] A Foreign Office spokesperson denied rumors circulating in Rome that the new armistice agreement with Italy had secret clauses attached. Italian residents here and three people who saw the full text of the document in Paris also denied that its contents differed in any way from what was previously published to the Roman press. [Premier] De Gasperi had not yet seen the full text of the new agreement, so upon hearing the rumors, he telegraphed London for inquiries. The British side assured him that there were no secret clauses. It is understood that the full text of the new agreement will be released once General [blank], Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, and the Italian Prime Minister sign it.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The new Director of the Finance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office. The former Director, Pu Zhengdong, welcomed him into the Director's office and personally completed the handover procedures, which took half an hour. He then accompanied him to the meeting room to meet with all the staff gathered there and gave a speech introducing him, saying briefly: "Director Gu is a scholar of finance and economics, and his writings have long been admired by all sectors. This time, he has taken over the leadership of this bureau and will definitely make the city's finances increasingly solid. I hope that all colleagues will continue to work hard with the spirit of service they have shown in the past." Gu then gave a speech, which was very humble, saying briefly: "I lack talent and ability, and I still hope that all colleagues will continue to assist me with the same spirit with which they assisted Director Pu in the past. Regarding personnel, I have never advocated for changes. I came here alone and will leave here alone in the future, so I hope that all colleagues can work with peace of mind."

<p>Director Gu immediately received reporters from this newspaper and made a statement, emphasizing his confidence in establishing a civil service system and that personnel should not be changed arbitrarily. In the future, he will be a public servant of the people, and everything will be considered from the perspective of the people. When reporters asked whether there were any new measures to address the city's past financial revenues falling short of expenditures, Gu replied: I have just taken office, and concrete measures have not yet been decided. However, to maintain a balanced budget, revenue must be increased and expenditure reduced. Taxes will be adjusted based on the principles of fairness, reasonableness, and universality. In the past, the city's revenue relied heavily on entertainment taxes and banquet taxes, while the property tax rate was too low. In the future, reasonable adjustments should be made to supplement revenue.</p>
<p>Gu is from Suzhou. He studied hard in his early years, diligently encouraged himself, and eventually became one of the country's leading experts in finance and economics. Gu worked for the Post Office for more than 20 years.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The new Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, took office at 3:45 PM yesterday. Director Zhu arrived at the bureau at 3:20 PM. Accompanied by the former Director, Chen Shi[blank]quan, he convened senior officials of the bureau. Chen first gave a speech introducing him, and then Zhu gave a speech, which lasted 20 minutes.

Director Zhu then officially started working after [blank].</p>
<p>In his introduction of the new Director, the former Director Chen humbly said that he had been working for eight months since the victory but had not made much progress due to his weak talent. The new Director Zhu not only has deep research in the field of land administration but also has rich experience in land administration, with outstanding achievements in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and during his tenure at the Land Administration Department. It is believed that he will be able to fulfill his duties happily. The colleagues in this bureau, whether newly arrived from the mainland or original members, have a lot of experience in land administration. I am deeply grateful for their assistance.

<p>Shanghai is an international city, and its environment is complex, unlike any other metropolis in the world. After the chaos of the occupation period, it feels as if there are thousands of loose ends to be sorted out, which is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to first study the current situation in Shanghai before formulating a policy based on academic principles. The current work policy of this bureau can be divided into four points: (1) It is hoped that the land registration procedures will be simplified to reduce the difficulties for the people; (2) Shorten the processing time, because deeds and other items can be used as circulating financial instruments in Shanghai. If they are kept in government offices for too long, the people will suffer losses; (3) Reduce the fees for the people: Land registration fees are stipulated by laws and regulations. It is hoped that it will be done as much as possible within the scope of the laws and regulations, and it is hoped that all sectors will report any such incidents at any time, and the bureau will punish them severely. Finally, Director Zhu encouraged his subordinates with his three rules of serving for ten years! (1) Don't want money, (2) Don't fear difficulties, (3) Don't fear hardship. Zhu also said that he will be going to Ping soon to handle the handover of the Northeast Headquarters.</p>

It has a gross tonnage of 3,363 tons, a deadweight (cargo capacity) of 1,924.33 tons, a length of 322 feet, a width of 15.5 feet, and a speed of 14 knots. The entire journey from Shanghai to Ningbo is 136 nautical miles, and the ship is expected to arrive in 10 hours at the planned speed. The ship's cabins have been freshly painted, and the interior facilities are perfect. The passenger capacity includes 28 first-class passengers (i.e., deluxe cabins), 36 second-class passengers (i.e., official cabins), 46 third-class passengers (i.e., staterooms), 555 fourth-class passengers, and 575 fifth-class passengers, for a total of 1,240 passengers.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Jiang Tonghai, a 33-year-old Taiwanese man, resided at No. 15, Dongsiwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, a man in a Western suit suddenly entered Jiang's bedroom. At the time, only Jiang's young daughter, Xiuhong (10 years old), was at home, as his wife, Yuan Qiaoying (from Suzhou), was out buying groceries. The man saw Jiang sound asleep on the bed and fired a shot at Jiang with a handgun, striking Jiang's left temple. Blood flowed profusely in an instant, and the assailant immediately fled. Xiuhong burst into tears upon witnessing the scene. Jiang's wife returned shortly after and immediately reported the incident to the police and summoned an ambulance to take the injured man to the hospital, where he died at 10:00 PM that evening. Song Bingzheng, the second section chief of the Xincheng Precinct, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched officers to investigate the scene, where they found the bed soaked in blood. According to Jiang Xiuhong, the assailant was an acquaintance of her father, known only by the surname Wu, and was also Taiwanese. It was later learned that Wu had previously been in business with Jiang. It was also discovered that the deceased had previously sold morphine and was known as the "Drug Kingpin." The cause of this sudden murder is very complicated, and the truth is currently being thoroughly investigated, and the culprit will be strictly apprehended and brought to justice.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] All the clerks and recorders of the High Court and District Court and the Prosecutor's Office in this city, due to their impoverished living conditions, held a meeting at the High Prosecutor's Office on West Yanan Road the day before yesterday afternoon,提出要求two demands: (1) Each person be given a temporary emergency relief fund of 200,000 yuan, and (2) The authorities implement the Legislative Yuan's resolution on civil servant treatment (i.e., adding a living allowance of 200,000 yuan, and calculating it as 1,000 times the base salary). Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, they submitted a collective leave request from all clerks and recorders to the presidents of the two courts, ceasing work from noon when the air raid siren sounded. Therefore, when the District Court held a trial yesterday afternoon, it had to have the judge act as the court recorder, while the High Court was able to try the case of the traitor only after strongly inviting Recorder Yang Daqi. According to reliable sources, the court authorities have decided to first agree to advance one month's salary. The clerks, on the other hand, have changed their request to advance two months' salary, but this matter still needs to be referred to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for a decision. The District Court, due to economic difficulties, reportedly sent the chief accountant to Beijing a few days ago to request instructions. It is also learned that this collective leave request by the clerks and recorders is also in response to the collective leave movement of the Suzhou High Court, but in order to fulfill their duties, they will continue to work as usual from tomorrow, awaiting the approval of the Ministry of Judicial Administration.</p>

<h3 id="e73">"Three-Dynasty Veteran" Xia Qifeng Desperately Seeks "Coexistence and Co-prosperity" Under the Jaws of the Beast, Judge Angrily Denounces the Old-Time Traitor <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The traitor Xia Qifeng, who served as a "three-dynasty veteran" in the puppet regime, finally bowed his head in the solemn court of our nation's laws and received his deserved punishment.</p>
<p>Xia, from Taixian, Jiangsu Province, is 59 years old, with a shaved head, a sad face, and wearing a dark blue gown, looking very listless. Xia was originally a government official in our government, but he betrayed the country and sought glory when the War of Resistance broke out. He organized the so-called "Reformed Government" and served as the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Internal Affairs. Later, the group of villains in North China, under the leadership of Wang Kemin, organized the so-called "Provisional Government." He rushed to Peiping and served as the director of the Political Affairs Department of the Joint Committee of the Puppet Government. In September of the 28th year, he returned south and served as the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet government. When Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government in Nanjing, he served as the "Minister of Audit" and later also as a standing director of the "Great People's Association," inciting the people and promoting pro-Japanese ideas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the strict questioning of Judge Qiu, he finally began to tremble, but he still tried to quibble, saying that his joining the puppet regime was entirely due to Chen Qun's persecution and confinement in the Central Hotel, so he managed to get his name on the list. Going to Peiping was upon the recommendation of Chen Bi, the puppet Foreign Minister. During his tenure as his own "Foreign Minister," there were few visitors and he had no contact with foreigners at all. He only met with the reporter Kot of the Ta Mei Evening News, hoping to use his relationship to contact Zhang Sixu to do underground work, but Zhang was assassinated. Later, he cooperated with the French consul. According to him, he finally found an international line to resist the Axis powers. When he said this, he seemed like a righteous gentleman. But Judge Qiu said, "You are simply an old-time traitor!" This sentence, the first time a judge had called a defendant a "traitor," made the traitor so embarrassed that even his ears turned red, and he could not speak. But he took two breaths and continued to argue that the "Great People's Association" was a fake people's association with no members, only staff, and that the Central Executive Committee was a "nominal" committee with nothing to do and nothing to be done. But no matter how cunning he is, the national law will certainly not let this three-dynasty puppet official go lightly. Finally, the judge announced that the case would be adjourned, and the puppet official was taken down for further detention.</p>
<p>Zhang Guanfu and Zhu Ruilin</p>
<p>The Special Criminal Court of the High Court yesterday also re-examined the case of Zhang Guanfu. Zhang is from Shanghai, 22 years old, and runs the Da Zhonghua Shoe Store and the Shanghai Leather Company. Because he led the enemy police to uncover the radio station set up by Chen Hui, Chen and the deceased Xiao Mingqian (Weichen) were arrested. After the victory, Chen reported to the Association of Comrades Who Suffered During the War of Resistance, and Zhang was detained and sent to the High Court for investigation and prosecution. The defendant denied all the accusations. He claimed that he himself had also suffered at the hands of the enemy police. Zhu Ruilin, a native of Chuansha, had opened a wire nail factory and supplied it to the enemy army. Yesterday, he was re-examined, and the defendant still denied supplying it to the army. Both cases were adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>Yang was sentenced to six years of imprisonment</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced the traitor Yang Bei. The main text: Yang Bei colluded with enemy countries, resisted this country, sentenced to six years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for six years, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for the family.</p>
<p>Zhu Shunlin's verdict was not accepted</p>
<p>Also, Zhu Shunlin, the chief inspector of the "Hollywood" and "Six Nations Hotel" and other large casinos in western Shanghai, was previously prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for the crime of treason. After a trial, the defendant hired three lawyers, including Zhang Shizhao, to defend him. Yesterday, the High Court announced that it would not accept the case and would transfer it to the District Court for trial as an ordinary criminal case. In addition, two traitors, Zhu Ada and Huang Senhan, were tried yesterday, and the court ordered the verdict to be announced on the 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e79">British Ministry of Education - Incentivizing University Education - University Scholarships, etc. Reach 800,000 Pounds Annually <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 21st] The Ministry of Education announced today that starting this October, all male and female students in England and Wales who receive university scholarships will receive subsidies from the government if their parents' annual income is less than £1,500. For parents whose income is less than £600, the government will further subsidize their scholarship to cover tuition and living expenses. The Ministry of Education has graded the amount of subsidies based on income below £1,500 per year. This plan will cause the national expenditure on scholarships and subsidies to reach £800,000 per year. Scholarships generally do not exceed £100 per year. Until now, students who have received scholarships have had to rely on subsidies or loans from local education authorities because the cost per academic year is £300 to £400. The national scholarship has always been only 360 places per year, most of which are awarded to students holding university scholarships. The recently announced subsidy plan is the implementation of a proposal by the Norwood Committee in June 1943: "Those who receive university scholarships have the right to apply for public subsidies." In addition, the Ministry of Education is also implementing another proposal by Norwood, namely that the current secondary school examination will be abolished and replaced by a two-part examination: one part is a university scholarship examination, and the other part is a university entrance examination, or a qualification test for a preliminary vocational examination without examination. At the same time, the current graduation examination between the ages of 14 and 17 will also be cancelled or thoroughly reformed in order to relieve students of the burden of examinations before the age of 17 and to strive to meet the individual needs of students. The purpose of the Ministry of Education is to find new techniques to preserve school achievements in order to discover the talents and intelligence of individual students.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Guiding Committee of the Political Department of the Youth Army previously requested to send 300 Youth Army students to study abroad, and the Foreign Affairs Bureau requested to send 700 interpreters to study abroad. Although both were approved by Chairman Chiang, according to the person in charge of the Ministry of Education speaking to reporters: the dispatch of these students is still very difficult in practice. The funds required for them to study abroad are huge. The Ministry of Education once jointly requested the Executive Yuan to allocate funds for sending them, but whether it can be approved by the Executive Yuan meeting is still doubtful. In addition, the number of students that each country contacted by the Ministry of Education to send students to is limited. Therefore, the above-mentioned overseas study examination will be postponed. However, those of the Youth Army and staff who are qualified to participate in the overseas study examination can still participate in this year's publicly funded overseas study examination.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Quick Sketch of Shanghai University <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Since the victory, Shanghai University has been preparing to move back to its original campus on Jungong Road. After a month of inspection, negotiation, and fundraising by the new president, Mr. Ling Xianyang, and several professors, various difficulties were overcome. Finally, the relocation work was completed on April 21, and the class was officially resumed on the original campus on the 22nd.</p>
<p>On April 26th, a celebration of the school's restoration was held in the magnificent auditorium. President Ling and the professors all attended with their wives. The program on that day was wonderful. Professor Lei Yuan's solo performance on the steel saw (a musical instrument) received the most applause, and the teachers and students were united.</p>
<p>The exact number of students in the school is 901, with only a dozen students commuting and the rest living on campus. The auditorium is very spacious, with a full 1,000 seats, so it is enough to accommodate all the students for meetings.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the total area of ​​the school covers 330 acres, with a total of 43 buildings of various sizes.</p>
<p>The male dormitory occupies "Si Yi" and "Si Pei" halls, and the female dormitory also occupies two buildings. At the entrance of the male and female dormitories, signs are hung separately with the words "No Female Visitors" or "No Male Visitors".</p>
<p>The scenery on campus is excellent, but unfortunately, it has been occupied by the Japanese invaders for many years, and much has been destroyed, so it is not as good as before. Several large trees that could be embraced have been transplanted to Jiangwan by the Japanese invaders. Recently, they have repeatedly negotiated with the authorities and are preparing to move them back.</p>
<p>The school holds memorial weekly meetings twice a week. President Ling attends each time to report on school affairs. At the first weekly meeting, he said: "It is estimated that the school's losses in this war are more than 100 million yuan. The cost of construction has been 30 million yuan so far. There are still many things to be repaired, and the funds are quite difficult. Most of it depends on the assistance of the church and does not raise funds from the students." Students are required to attend weekly meetings, take seats according to their numbers, and the order is orderly.</p>
<p>The library has more than 53,000 books, and there are many newspapers available for students to read every day.</p>
<p>For the sake of caution, the drinking water in the school has been sent to the Municipal Health Bureau for inspection, and the result is considered to be quite clean.</p>
<p>For the needs of the students, a barbershop and a laundry shop have been established on campus, which are cheap and of good quality, and are very popular among the students.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to take care of the education of the children of the professors, there has recently been a proposal to establish a primary school, which will be taught by students of the Department of Education to conduct practical tests. Students can freely enter and leave the school from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. For the rest of the time, they must ask for leave from the Training Office if they go out. The procedures are quite strict, because President Ling attaches great importance to the "school spirit."</p>
<p>The gold-lettered school nameplate outside the school gate was inscribed by Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng. Dr. Zheng is the founder of the Shanghai University School of Science. He has served for thousands of years. With several strands of white hair, he has seen all the changes in the world. Now he sees Ling Xianyang taking over as president, with arduous tasks, and making persistent efforts to lay a new foundation for the alma mater, and he should also smile and stroke his beard.</p>

In the end, Xiqing won with a score of 21-19. The Shantou team had 15 free throws yesterday, but only made three of them. Otherwise, they could have turned defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Before the second game between Lianghua and Signal, Liu Hesheng reported that Mr. Cheng Bo'an, who is enthusiastic about sports, donated 1 million yuan to the floor construction fund. The audience applauded upon hearing the news. When the whistle sounded to start the game, the two teams were evenly matched and tied four times.

<p>Liu Shuge asked: Zhuo'er is two years and five months old. Last winter in Fuzhou, he suddenly had a fever one night, and the next morning his limbs trembled and he could not stand or walk? It was found that the illness occurred when he was still healthy, only that he had suffered from extremely severe diarrhea some time ago, which almost led to death, but he recovered after treatment. Since his legs and waist became weak, he lived in Fuzhou Union Hospital for diagnosis and treatment for ten days without effect. It was said to be "anterior osteomyelitis of the spinal cord". Later, he left Rong and came to Hangzhou, and received intermittent diagnosis and treatment with Chinese and Western medicine. At the moment, he can move the part below his right heel, and he can flex and stretch. The left toe can only move slightly, and his waist is still [weak]. I have always admired your newspaper for its enthusiastic service, and I pray for your guidance.</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] The disease is indeed anterior poliomyelitis. Flat-stream electrical therapy, massage, and injection of large amounts of vitamin B preparations can be performed.</p>
<p>Wang Bikan from Guang'an, Sichuan, asked: I mistakenly committed masturbation in my childhood, which caused great losses. Due to economic reasons, I have not been able to cure it for more than ten years. Now the disease is getting worse and worse, and it has become impotence. I still have one or two nocturnal emissions every month, tinnitus, blurred vision, waist pain, and weakness in the limbs. The above symptoms are very dangerous. Because I live in a remote rural area, there are no good doctors and special medicines. Please give me good advice. If I can be cured, I will definitely worship your name every day.</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) You need to quit the bad habit of masturbation. (2) One or two nocturnal emissions per month are not a pathological phenomenon. (3) Do not drink too much water or overeat before going to bed, develop the habit of sleeping on your side, do not make the bedding too hot, and pay attention to fitness exercises.</p>
<p>Yang Shouren asked: I am a small civil servant, and my daily income and expenditure are already difficult to balance, but unfortunately my father is also suffering from a disease. The Chinese medicine name is phlegm madness, and taking medicine has not healed it. Yesterday, I changed to a large hospital for treatment. According to the diagnosis, it is "chronic alcohol poisoning." Because there is no special medicine at present, it is difficult to cure, and I am very anxious! Please answer or publish it in this column, and ask Chinese and Western masters at home and abroad to show good prescriptions. I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] If you suffer from chronic alcohol poisoning, you need to quit drinking and inject large amounts of vitamin B preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Depending on the Situation of Work and Materials - Organize Road Repair and Ditch Clearing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Public Reply from the Municipal Works Bureau</p>
<p>We have received your letter, along with the original letter from Yu Zhang, regarding the question of when road repairs will be implemented. Citizens often ask questions, and you asked us to publish our opinions for public publication, which shows your enthusiasm for social service. Since the roads in this city have been in disrepair for a long time and are damaged everywhere, and the degree of damage varies, this bureau has regarded road repair and ditch clearing as the most important business since it took over. However, due to limited financial and material resources, it is really difficult to carry out them universally at the same time. We have to consider the situation of work and materials and distinguish between urgency. I believe that the citizens of the city will be able to understand this. We hereby reply for your reference and publication. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Eighteenth Day, attached is the original letter from Yu Zhang, Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau</p>
<p>Warning to those who blindly worship foreign goods</p>
<p>Editor: I am teaching at the School of Business of Guanghua University. When I went to school today, I saw many DDT solutions displayed on the stalls near the school gate, marked "Made in the United States." Buyers rushed to buy them. At that time, I saw that the bottles used were discarded beer bottles from the US military, and I was deeply suspicious. When I carefully distinguished what was written on the label, it was "Produced by the American 'Packaging' Company," and I suddenly realized it. I couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions. It is not enough to blame such speculative counterfeiting of foreign goods to deceive the Chinese people, but the Chinese people only see the words "foreign goods". Then they blindly worship, regardless of being fooled. It is really sad to be so dead set! I dare to borrow your publication to disclose this to my patriotic people. Sincerely, Cai Wenxi</p>

<p>After the rebound the day before yesterday, there was still much fear of the pressure of the Bank of China yesterday. Some short sellers in the industry struggled fiercely. The opening in the morning saw a slight setback. The short side was active. Rumors spread that the Bank of China would continue to exert pressure outside the pass at 1.9 million, and it fell to below 1.86 million before gradually stabilizing.

Before noon, it fell to around 1.85 million, and immediately rose back to the 1.9 million mark. At noon, it hovered around 1.88 million. In the afternoon, the Cantonese and Fujian gangs still had sporadic transactions. After the 1.9 million mark was tentatively broken, the buying sentiment was slightly stronger, and it rose back to above 1.92 million. As a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous day by 15,000. Jewelry gold was quoted at 10,002, pure silver and silver dollars remained flat, and the informal discount was from 1.4 to 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>The US dollar was weak and then stabilized. The opening in the morning was 2,380 yuan, and after entering, it always fluctuated between 2,350 yuan and 2,390 yuan. Before noon, it was difficult to cross the 2,400 yuan mark. In the afternoon, gold seemed to rise slightly, so it stood firmly above 2,400 yuan.

<p>In order to seek communication between Shanghai and Taiwan's economy, Mr. Chen, the chief administrator of Taiwan Province, specially sent Mr. Xie Huiyuan to Shanghai to establish the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Taiwan, which officially opened a few days ago. It is known that Shanghai-Taiwan remittance has also started from today. The ratio of Legal Tender to Taiwan Dollar is 30 Legal Tender yuan to 1 Taiwan dollar. However, at present, it is only limited to remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan. Remittances from Taiwan to this city can be realized in the short term.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned weak due to the small gold price report. The Cantonese and Hubei gangs intended to wait and see, and rarely purchased. As a result, 20-count Shuangma yarn gradually fell to 1.26 million, a drop of 780,000 compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count medium and small yarns also followed by 350,000 yuan. However, 42-count Blue Phoenix double-strand yarn, because the drop at the close yesterday was huge, only dropped by 230,000, and the transaction was quite rare, and people's hearts were extremely bland.</p>
<p>The cloth market was affected by the decline in gold and yarn prices, and the needs of the Kejia Gang and Menzhuang were not good. Market prices were mostly weak and few were firm. Fangjian Company once opened to sell 27 kinds of cloth, and 17 kinds of American and Mexican cloth.</p>
<p>In the flower market, New York American cotton continued to rise by 23 to 29 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.45, the far-term was 27.98, and the current meterlin spot was 28.05.

<p>Since the Tianjin gang's appetite has been moderate since the previous day, it has not been brightened yet. However, the digestion of the stores in this street and the area of ​​Suzhou and Wuxi has increased unabated. However, buyers and sellers have absorbed and sold each other, so it is difficult to distinguish between honor and disgrace. As for the foreign tea market, the sound of Indian merchants actively buying Wuyuan Chente is very loud. At present, Ruichang, Nianmazhi, and other lines are negotiating with the holders of goods. It is heard that more than a hundred dans have been dragged in by Nianmazhi Foreign Company. The trend is that the green tea with rare and beautiful goods and without coloring, the American merchants are still rarely consulted.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The Commercial Daily said that there is a severe shortage of Oriental carpets on the American market, and even those who are willing to buy newly made Oriental carpets at a high price of 2,000 yuan are not easy to buy.</p>

<p>Huagu is back to the old tricks. Jingfu, a small stock that no one has consulted for several days, was suddenly pulled up by large households in the industry. The claim that the sound of chiming is pleasant is spread. Speculators who are familiar with profiteering face a short squeeze wave. The two major stocks are also indirectly benefited and brought up. The midway is quite brilliant. The prospect will depend on whether retail investors are willing to enter the whirlpool of the Han again to determine the overall situation. Yongsha rose from 4,830 yuan to 5,000 yuan, Meiya rose from 3,700 yuan to 4,000 yuan, and Jingfu jumped sharply from 285 yuan to 340 yuan before slightly returning. Xinguang opened in the morning at 225 yuan, and Qinxing was 190 yuan, both ending at high prices. As a result, Yongsha Meiya rose slightly compared to the previous day, and Jingfu Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by more than 10%. The remaining stocks were stable, and the veteran stocks were also oversupplied. The foreign stock situation was peaceful, and there was no power to rise. After hovering, all stocks except the steel industry, because the transaction on the previous day was not universal and did not fall, and there were more sellers yesterday, fell by 10% alone. The rest rose and fell slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Social Affairs Bureau Vigorously Implements Emergency Measures; Prices Have Begun to Decline; Various Industries Prepare to Report Rice Stocks; Rumors of Purchased Foreign Rice Already Being Shipped <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The city's rice reserves are quite sufficient, enough to supply needs for at least three months. There is no shortage of supply, yet recently, the rising price trend has been frequent and the fluctuations extreme. The municipal authorities believe that unscrupulous individuals are manipulating the market. The municipal government convened a meeting the other day and agreed on four emergency measures, which were handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for diligent implementation. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct discreet investigations, the bureau has ordered warehouses, various industries, and foreign merchant warehouses to report within a time limit. If there is deliberate concealment, failure to report, or underreporting, once discovered and verified, severe punishment will be imposed. At the same time, the rice market is strictly forbidden from allowing members to buy and sell speculatively on behalf of outsiders, in order to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Announcement</p>
<p>"Investigation reveals that the city's rice reserves are not lacking and that supplies are continuous. Since supply and demand are normal, the market should be stable. However, rice prices have recently skyrocketed and fluctuated greatly, indicating that unscrupulous individuals are hoarding and manipulating the market in an attempt to make exorbitant profits. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, relevant industries have been ordered to report their grain reserves, and speculation by outsiders has been strictly prohibited. If any unscrupulous individuals disregard the overall situation and speculate by raising prices, people are permitted to report the facts and await severe punishment. If illegal hoarding is confirmed, all hoarded rice will be confiscated and half of its total value will be used as a reward to encourage reporting. This is being announced for general knowledge."</p>
<p>Rice Merchants' Meeting</p>
<p>The two guilds, the bean and rice industry and the rice shop industry, were ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 20th of this month to have their members fill out reports on their grain reserves within three days. The two guilds immediately convened an emergency meeting of directors to discuss the measures and notified all members to fill out the reports within the specified time. However, due to the large number of members scattered throughout the city, it is feared that they will not be able to complete the task on schedule.</p>
<p>Another report states that the Qinglian Pavilion rice market on Fourth Avenue has received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, stipulating that the market must submit detailed reports daily of the names of both buyers and sellers, the names of their managers, the transaction prices, and quantities, for verification purposes. The market was ordered to comply from the date of the document's arrival. The market immediately notified rice merchants that all firms buying and selling in the market must, from now on, fill out three copies of a form detailing the names of the sellers and buyers, the names of their managers, the transaction prices, and quantities, and submit them to the association daily for collation and transmission.</p>
<p>Market Reorganization</p>
<p>There is also news of the reorganization of the city's rice market. The city's rice market was divided into North and South markets before the war. After the war, it was concentrated in Qingyun Pavilion as a temporary market. Because the area is small and the people are many, management is difficult, and it is easy for speculators to infiltrate. In light of the recent soaring rice prices, the responsible authorities, in addition to taking various effective measures, have also ordered the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee to restore trading in the North and South markets. It is stipulated that the North market will still be located at the original site of the Rice Merchant Guild, and the South market will be located at Cuixiu Hall. They are also ordered to prepare a concrete reorganization plan and submit it for approval.</p>
<p>Purchasing Foreign Rice</p>
<p>After Pang Songzhou, the Grain Department's specialist, and Wang, the acting special commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning, they immediately visited Director Liu of the Enemy Property Management Bureau and Mayor Wu to discuss plans for allocating grain to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of the Grain Department, the Grain Ministry, up to the most recent date, has directly or indirectly ordered more than 160,000 tons of foreign rice from South America and Siam (excluding the 120,000 tons of rice allocated by the United Nations). Wheat and other grains are still being negotiated. The ordered rice has already been shipped and the first batch of more than 10,000 tons is expected to arrive in Shanghai this month. As for the shipment of Sichuan rice to relieve the famine in Central China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it has already begun. In two weeks, more than 30 specialized ships will carry Sichuan rice to supply the lower reaches. With foreign rice and Sichuan rice arriving in a continuous stream, the current grain shortages in Shanghai, Guangdong, Wuhan, and Hunan may be alleviated.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the China Canned Food Industry Company, whose headquarters were originally in Chongqing, processed military and civilian grain and transported and sold grain during the war. It is now establishing an office in Shanghai and has ordered approximately 2 million large bags of foreign rice from various import merchants. The shipping dates are between June and July. It is reported that due to rising grain prices in Shanghai, the company has decided to sell the ordered foreign rice to various rice shops and factories in the city. With this large source of rice, the people of this city can be assured of food during the lean months of this year.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Fall</p>
<p>Because the authorities acted decisively, all parties were wary. Yesterday, the rice market became stagnant, and large households sought to sell off their stocks, but there were few buyers. The number of transactions in the market was very small, and prices continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour also fell by another 500 to 600 yuan, the oil market continued to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, soybean cake fell by 400 to 500 yuan, and soybeans continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in the city, according to the rice market, was more than 5,800 piculs. As for general hoarders and various industries storing rice, they are preparing to fill out forms and report to the association in order to submit them within the specified time limit. According to sources at the Social Affairs Bureau, many people directly inquired with the bureau about reporting methods yesterday, and the bureau instructed them to report to their respective industry associations for collection.</p>
<p>According to rice merchant sources, the difficulties encountered by various producing areas in exporting rice have decreased significantly recently, so shipments are gradually becoming smoother. Tens of cars of Anhwei Sen rice stranded in Nanjing have already had 20 cars transported to the city a few days ago. The Ministry of Food and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Shipping Company have discussed the transportation of 2 million dans of Sichuan rice and will soon be ready to begin shipping.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Flour</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the people's food shortage, the Social Affairs Bureau has obtained some flour and is preparing to sell it at a low price. It is planned to sell 1,500 bags per day, entrusted to 50 rice shops to sell on consignment, targeting the poor. Each person is limited to buying 6 catties, and the price is calculated at 60% of the market price. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting of the persons in charge of these 50 shops today to discuss the sales procedures, in order to ensure that the benefits reach the people.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was extremely tight because the enemy property sugar on Monday was not auctioned off, and no new company goods were opened. The China Granulated Sugar Association's market opened in the morning from 75,000 yuan to 76,000 yuan to 76,500 yuan, with slight fluctuations along the way, ranging from 76,250 yuan to 76,500 yuan, eventually reaching 77,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e101">No Control of Domestic Remittances <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>There have recently been rumors in Shanghai that the Central Bank and other national banks will manage or control domestic commercial remittances. According to an interview with the person in charge of the Central Bank, domestic remittances are the main business of commercial banks, and the national bank has no intention of managing or controlling them. Since the victory, the national bank has been coordinating financial turnovers in the recovered areas. All remittances from the national bank bureaus to various places are handled by the national bank, and commercial banks often ask the national bank to remit when they lack turnover in a certain place. The current traditional domestic remittance control is mostly a matter of imagination.</p>

<h3 id="e109">A Socially Respected Person Highly Regarded by Both the Government and the Public; Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 20th; Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>There is no one more worthy of respect in the world than someone who has created his social position through his career. "Wang Yunwu" is a name inseparable from "The Commercial Press." Mr. Wang Yunwu's career is built on the countless volumes and the illustrated books closely linked to the progressive lives of millions of people.</p>
<p>This socially respected person, highly regarded by both the government and the public, is an "old man" with the temperament of a child. Although he appears to have gray hair and beard, his spirit, demeanor, and interest and attention to all matters have the vitality of a child, full of soaring and leaping energy. That white hair and beard have only become the embellishment of his special charm.</p>
<p>Short White Hair; Short and Sturdy Figure</p>
<p>He is short and stocky, but very strong. The top of his head is already bald, and he has an extremely thick, silvery-white mustache on his lips. His voice is loud, his enunciation is clear, and he is full of vocal expression. His pure Mandarin and clear gestures will make people pay attention to his conversation and be able to understand it thoroughly.</p>
<p>When the "Political Consultative Conference" was held, Mr. Wang Yunwu was invited to attend as a non-partisan, socially respected person. In that turbulent conference process, the representatives of socially respected people were always relatively quiet. They occupied one end of the U-shaped conference table on the right side. Mr. Wang Yunwu sat to the right of Fu Sinian and opposite Hu Lin. This quiet corner was also a corner that attracted a lot of attention from the audience. Because on some issues, only from here could some correct answers be found, especially from Mr. Wang Yunwu, people could test the atmosphere of the entire venue from his expressive face. He often engaged in written conversations and whispers with Fu Sinian and Hu Lin, and when he found that their feelings were the same, he would happily scratch his bald scalp and even make faces.</p>
<p>During the Conference; Waves of Laughter Tumbling</p>
<p>I remember one day, when discussing the National Assembly issue, Zhang Bojun took out a Ta Kung Pao from a long time ago during his speech and read an editorial on it to prove that his theory of not recognizing the old representatives was also the opinion of non-partisans, reading for five minutes. Wang Yunwu and Fu Sinian handed notes to Hu Lin on the opposite side, congratulating Mr. Hu: "Ta Kung Pao actually has such a loyal reader!" At that time, Mr. Wang Yunwu's childlike, interested expression, Fu Sinian's squinting eyes, and Hu Lin's fat face formed a satirical picture of the speaker. Because in that solemn gathering, which appeared in the posture of representing public opinion, there were actually many things that could not help but make people laugh.</p>
<p>Confused Situation; Still Commanding Calmly</p>
<p>In this Political Consultative Conference, the non-partisan representatives were not spectators who folded their arms without any opinions. When some issues were debated endlessly, they often stood up and spoke with an expression of "I can't help but say a few words." Mr. Wang Yunwu was one of the people who spoke more often. His attitude when speaking was extremely serious and sincere. He swung his gray-haired head, waved his short and powerful arms, and spoke in a clear and distinct voice. That demeanor of侃侃and talking 条分analyzing侃侃and talking made one think of the characters in the British Parliament. His seat was directly opposite Mr. Shao Congen. His energetic 神态 and Mr. Shao's trembling and trembling expression at the same time, were extremely moving scenes. I remember one time, when talking about the number of places in the National Assembly, Mr. Wang used his "abacus" to make a scientific distribution, which won laughter from the entire venue.</p>
<p>In the previous sessions of the National Political Council, Mr. Wang Yunwu was also a very capable chairman. He was energetic and controlled the time of the conference with a "scientific management" method, meticulous and orderly. In the most chaotic situation, he could command calmly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu is an energetic old man, who can manage things with strict scientific methods and live with an optimistic and progressive attitude.</p>
<p>Bringing Business Spirit to Politics</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reorganization of the government, he was first invited to head the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Mr. Wang's past achievements in his career will guarantee that he can become a good official who truly works for the people. If China's politics is to progress, it must inject new blood into these nearly optimized institutions. China needs democracy, but China does not need "street politicians" who only sell empty words, specialize in shouting slogans, and play political tricks. Here I want to say again: "There is no one more worthy of respect in the world than someone who has created his social position through his career!" We hope that Mr. Wang Yunwu will bring his spirit of engaging in business to politics, and we hope that this warrior who has succeeded in his career can break all the old habits of politics and act as a pioneer on the road to political democratization, who becomes more energetic as he gets older.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>At this time, the artillery fire was still very intense. We decided to hang the national flags of China and the United States on one hand, and on the other, to hang the wooden sign of the Sino-Foreign Journalists' Reception Center at the gate. The words on the wooden sign were written by Shi Xun; the American flag was sewn together by Ms. Abernathy of the International News Service and a Japanese girl invited from nearby. Everyone found it amusing that this was a collaboration between the United States and Japan!</p>
<p>Although the fighting outside was fierce, we found it quite warm and peaceful inside the house. Zhao Junmai and Abernathy were both classmates at the University of Wisconsin. They sang the school song together or played bridge. We Chinese journalists, on the other hand, sat facing each other playing Weiqi. But after playing for half a day, our minds were finally disturbed by the gunfire, and the game was scattered all over, without making any sense.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the fighting got closer and closer. The main force of the Communist army in the south had crossed the Academy of Sciences of China, the Botanical and Zoological Garden, and Shuntian Park, and occupied the Man-Tan Building. Man-Tan was right in front of our journalists' reception center, three hundred meters away. A stray bullet hit the rooms upstairs where Beckett and Shi Xun lived, entering through the outer glass window and making a hole in the wall. Our residence had become a target on the front line. We decided to move people to the basement to sleep, while the American journalists slept on the floor in the reception room.</p>
<p>The moon was particularly beautiful at night. A row of policemen, each with a rifle and several hand grenades, were stationed around the walls of our house. They were intently commanded by Platoon Leader Liu. At two o'clock in the morning, we were awakened from our sweet dreams. A continuous barrage of gunfire and shouts were heard all around the walls of our house, even more densely. We all knew that something was bound to happen tonight. Captain Liu came in to inform us to prepare in advance in case of emergency. Zhao Junmai was clear-headed and seriously concerned about us, especially the safety of our American friends. He instructed Captain Liu: "If the Communist army really comes, as a matter of principle, do not open fire on them, but explain that this is a Sino-Foreign Journalists' Residence, a neutral location."</p>
<p>Following this development, Zhao Junmai had to reconsider his own identity. In the rain of bullets, Zhao seemed to realize that the situation was not as stable as he had optimistically imagined. He first said to us, Chinese and foreign journalists: "From now on, don't call me Mayor Zhao anymore. I need to hide myself for a while." We agreed with his suggestion, but we couldn't think of a way to solve his predicament at the time. Later, he said himself: "I will also be a journalist. I really envy the life of you journalists. I will be a journalist for Ta Kung Pao, and my name is Yang Huaibai." From then on, before he was discovered by the Communist army as the mayor, we all called him "Old Yang," even our servants and guards called him "Mr. Yang." The change of address took a little getting used to, and we would always slip up and say "Mayor"!</p>
<p>Dashing Back to the Residence Through a Net of Fire</p>
<p>At dawn on the sixteenth, the gunfire receded, and the shouting and killing sounds were no longer audible. Captain Liu reported to us: "The Communist army has now retreated to the State Council." We pushed open the doors and windows and walked into the courtyard. The morning light was exceptionally fresh, still as peaceful as before, and the birds were singing happily on the branches.</p>
<p>At this time, the gunfire was even more intense in the north of the city. We knew that the north of the city was the railway station, and seizing the railway station was a strategic key point for transportation and supply. A life-and-death struggle, or rather a seesaw battle, was to be expected. We contacted Zhu Zhou, who lived in the Central Bank, by telephone. He said, "It was once occupied by the Communist army at 4 p.m. yesterday, and now it is under contention." We knew that Major Reik, the military attache of the American Embassy, lived in the Yamato Hotel next to the railway station. We were concerned about his safety and tried to talk to him by telephone, but the telephone was completely out of service.</p>
<p>At this time, the Communist army in the west, from the Imperial Household Ministry, had entered the city. We looked from the balcony and saw three fires breaking out in the west. We knew that these were the Fushunhou and Tianxingfu flour mills on fire. This was from 5 a.m. on the seventeenth.</p>
<p>Zhao Junmai still had this courage for peace. He and Beckett of the Associated Press and Abernathy of the International News Service went to the Central Bank first. At 11 a.m., Captain Liu said: "The security team of the State Council has retreated." At that time, the guards were all preparing to flee to the Central Bank. Zhao Junmai was not here at this time, so we had to take our belongings and Captain Liu to the Central Bank to ask for Zhao's opinion.</p>
<p>Zhao was also extremely busy, talking on the phone with Secretary Chen Jinghua of the Communist army at the West Airport. Chen Jinghua agreed to a ceasefire, but he asked Zhao to relay to Commander Chen Jiazhen to lay down their weapons first before discussing anything else. Zhao spoke with Chen for a moment, and Chen resolutely rejected the Communist's request. We knew at this time that the fate of Changchun was sealed.</p>
<p>We asked Chen Jiazhen very frankly: "What confidence do you have in sustaining this battle?" He said, "Xiong Shouzhu has sent a telegram saying that the New First Army had passed through Siping Street on the fifteenth." Chen's facial expression was very cold, and finally he spat out: "I can only defend the core area."</p>
<p>Zhao Junmai saw that peace was hopeless. It was a kite that had lost its string and drifted with the wind. He wanted us to go back immediately. Many people were crowded into one car, and some things were not taken in time. We went along Datong Street to the City Hall in Datong Square. Because there were so many people, I thought the car would come back for a second trip, but there was no car after that. Machine guns were shooting at our car like raindrops, forming a net of fire, cutting off traffic. Zhao Junmai wanted us to take shelter in the City Hall, but the driver was unwilling to go forward. We stood in front of the City Hall, watching batches of wounded soldiers retreating. Beckett of the Associated Press and Abernathy of the International News Service were both willing to go back. Shi Xun also agreed to this dangerous return. Zhao saw that everyone wanted to return to the Commissioner's Office, so he decided to instruct the driver to drive forward again. Five minutes later, we finally returned safely. But we found that the wheels and the rear of the car had been hit by four or five bullets.</p>
<p>Seeing the Communist Army's Movements</p>
<p>At around 11 a.m. (on the seventeenth), transport planes were constantly circling over the city. Captain Liu said: "Parachute troops are coming down from the sky." We ran out to watch. Wheeler, a reporter for the Chicago Daily Tribune, went out to photograph. When the parachute shadows descended to a certain level, we realized that they were dropping ammunition. For a time, the morale of the security team was greatly boosted, and gunfire erupted everywhere. This was the first time they dropped ammunition, and all the ammunition was dropped into the heart of the security team's position near Datong Square.</p>
<p>At about 1 p.m., the planes came again. At that time, the wind direction was very strong, and the ammunition dropped was almost entirely lost in the Communist army's position. In fact, the security team's position was getting smaller and smaller, and fierce fighting near the core position began at this time.</p>
<p>At this time, the security team also withdrew from the vicinity of our residence. Our residence was about to become a place of contention in a tug-of-war. We knew that danger was imminent. Zhao Junmai was very sensitive. He first instructed the guards to change into plain clothes and bury all the guns and hand grenades in the coal layer, indicating that our residence was a neutral place with no combat activity. There were Chinese and American flags on the roof, and a sign saying "Sino-Foreign Journalists' Residence" on the door.</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m., we saw from the glass window a company of Communist soldiers sitting under the wall of the house opposite to rest. They were wearing yellow cotton uniforms. Shi Xun saw several Communist soldiers walking in front of our residence, probably looking at the words "Journalists' Residence," and then they left. Zhao Junmai said, "I don't think we'll have any big trouble. The Communist army is still rational." Sure enough, the Communist army did not knock open our door.</p>
<p>We were at ease in our little world, still very peaceful. Dinner felt better than usual, and we even had canned pineapple to eat afterwards. Everyone said that the cook was getting better and better, worthy of being the famous chef of Marshal Wu Ziyu. Zhao Junmai raised his hand to distribute bread, like Christ dividing his last supper, and said, "Let's finish this delicious meal tonight. Perhaps this is our last meal!" In each of our hearts, there was a different feeling. We didn't know what to say, and we didn't know how to comfort ourselves. Everyone was silent for a long time, and finally surrounded the round table and sang loudly!</p>
<p>That night, the American journalists still slept downstairs, while Shi Xun and Yang Zhuozhi of the Jiangxi Zhengqi Daily, and the mayor, slept in the basement. We still thought that maybe the security team would launch a counterattack in the middle of the night, and there would be another great battle.</p>
<p>Late at night, at 11:30 p.m., because we were immersed in the great battle, we were mentally exhausted, so when Captain Liu came to wake us up, everyone couldn't get out of bed. Later, he said, "The Eighth Route Army is here." We suddenly woke up and saw more than a dozen Eighth Route Army soldiers with yellow uniforms, leather hats, and bright knives on their guns, with ferocious faces. (The Communist army called soldiers "warriors.") The platoon leader who spoke first was called Zhang Zhengchang. We told him that we were news reporters. Zhao Junmai, disguised as Yang Huaibai, a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, also began to use this identity.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhengchang initially expressed his apologies for disturbing us, and then explained that he wanted to borrow the house for accommodation. We Chinese and American journalists discussed it and decided on two principles: (1) This place is a journalist's residence and can only be borrowed for one night; (2) The entire upstairs cannot be occupied, and three rooms downstairs can be borrowed. Zhang Zhengchang agreed to accept our principles, so Shi Xun and McDesson lived in the east wing on the chess side, Yang Huaibai and Zhuozhi lived in the middle room, and Hui Dong lived alone in the west wing. In the large room downstairs, Li Yinman, Walker, and Abernathy slept together. They were all on the floor.</p>
<p>The next morning (the eighteenth), Abernathy woke up and found that she was surrounded by Communist soldiers on both sides. She was not very happy. She said, "This is the first time I've slept with men." Our original two principles stipulated that there should be three and a half male rooms downstairs. In fact, the Communist army occupied five and a half rooms. Zhang Zhengchang said, "It's really because the brothers haven't slept well for several days of fighting!"</p>
<p>The cook said, "Our rice was all eaten by the Communist soldiers last night!" We were still hungry until 11 a.m. We spoke to a battalion political instructor of the Communist army surnamed Guo. He agreed to return it, so we were able to have our lunch.</p>
<p>Political Instructor Guo had a heavy Shandong accent, like most of the Communist soldiers. He admitted that he had walked from Shandong after August 15, and some had come by sea from Yantai. When he spoke to us, he kept staring at the Changchun city map in his hand. We saw that the area he was drawing was the area of the Central Bank. Gunfire was attacking the Central Bank from all four directions.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Swarmed Away</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., the Communist soldiers living in our house swarmed away. We cleaned the house ourselves, wiped the tables, and felt that this was our home, and we liked it.</p>
<p>At dusk, at 6 p.m., there was an urgent knock on the door. Shi Xun and Wheeler went out to open the door. There were a total of five Communist soldiers, two with machine guns and three with pistols. They were invited to sit in the living room. The rest went downstairs to talk to them. Only Zhao Junmai, disguised as Yang Huaibai, a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, claimed to be ill and stayed in bed.</p>
<p>The Communist soldiers explained that attacking Changchun was a domestic issue, and the Soviet Union handing over sovereignty to the government was a diplomatic issue. These two things cannot be confused at all. Secondly, he also indicated that President Chiang was the leader of China, and if he could truly implement democracy and complete the united government.</p>
<p>At that time, the artillery fire was particularly dense, almost firing a dozen shots in one minute. We asked Sun Zheng, "Is this artillery fire aimed at the Central Bank?" He nodded, indicating that it was true. "Then, once this battle starts, when can it be resolved?" We continued to press.</p>
<p>"I think it can be taken down in an hour."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he said goodbye to us. When we pushed open the window, we saw flames reaching the sky. We went to the roof and identified that the burning buildings were the City Hall near Datong Square, the Central Bank, and the East Development Company. The entire blue sky was burned red.</p>
<p>The gunfire started and stopped, but finally subsided without a sound. In the distance, we could hear the mixed sounds of burning wood and the sound of the wind. We couldn't hear the sound of dogs barking in the alley, but when the hot wind blew, it brought a difficult-to-smell burnt wood smell.</p>
<p>After dinner, Sun Zheng sent a Platoon Leader Mao with three Communist soldiers to protect us. That night, we didn't close the gate!</p>
<p>But the night was unusually dark and terrible! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e111">Nine Great Patriotic Poets of the Late Song Dynasty <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Regarding the patriotic poets of the late Song Dynasty, the first to mention are three Jinshi scholars: Xu Yueqing, a Chunyou Jinshi; Zhen Shanmin, a late Song Jinshi; and Liang Dong, a Xianchun Jinshi.</p>
<p>Xu Yueqing was from Wuyuan and served as a registrar in Haozhou, relentlessly criticizing the treacherous minister Jia Sidao. After the Yuan army captured Qiantang, he secluded himself in a room, calling himself Quantiānzǐ (Master of Spring Fields). He remained mute for five years (some say ten), not uttering a single word, effectively considering himself dead; in reality, this was even more difficult than death. As a poet, he was known as Mr. Shānwū (Mountain Hut). Until his death, he never spoke a word. Although this was a passive form of resistance, his integrity is worthy of admiration. Xie Fangde greatly admired him and once inscribed a couplet on his door: "If you want to see Xie Fangde today, he is just like Xu Yueqing back then." Xu's poetry collection is titled "Xiantian Ji" (Collection of the Pre-Heaven), in two volumes, published by the Commercial Press in its Four Series Collection. Three years ago, these two books sparked my interest, and after reading them, I wrote an article published in "Cosmic Wind."</p>
<p>Zhen Shanmin was identified as surnamed Zhen because someone mentioned his ancestor Xishan. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he went into seclusion. Some say he was from Kuocang, originally named Gui Fang.</p>
<p>Liang Dong was originally from Xiangjiang but moved to Zhenjiang and served as a magistrate in Qiantang County. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, his younger brother Liang Zhu entered Maoshan Mountain to study with an old monk, and Dong went to rely on him. Dong wrote "Liang Longji's Time Notes." Three years ago, I also wrote an article titled "Liang Dong's Poems," published in "Cosmic Wind." This article and "Xu Yueqing's Poems" were written later, so they were not included in my humble compilation "A Short History of Patriotic Literature" (World Edition).</p>
<p>Next, we must mention two poets who were also artists: one was Wang Yuanliang, who could play the qin, and the other was Zheng Sixiao, who could paint orchids.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanliang was not only skilled in composing poetry and playing the qin, but also wrote Ci poetry. He is the author of "Hushan Leigao" (Drafts from Lakeside Mountains), etc. The Xiling Seal Society in Hangzhou seems to have published a special collection of his poetry and Ci, in two volumes, thread-bound. He became known to Empress Dowager Xie for his qin playing. After the fall of Hangzhou, Empress Dowager Xie and many palace women were captured, and he went with them on the same ship. On the ship, he saw that some palace women were quite patriotic, weeping all day long; while others applied rouge and powder, singing and dancing, hoping to gain the favor of the Yuan ruler in the future. He witnessed the daily activities of the palace women at the time, and like writing palace poems or bamboo branch lyrics, he continuously composed many seven-character quatrains. If Ruan Ji's important work is several "Yonghuai" (Expressing My Thoughts) poems, then Wang Yuanliang's important work is several palace poems placed at the beginning of his collection in "Song Poetry Excerpts." When he arrived in Yandu (Yanjing, present day Beijing), the Yuan emperor asked him if he wanted to become an official. He said he wished to become a Daoist priest. From then on, he traveled around, especially to Lushan Mountain. Some saw his踪跡 were飘忽, like飘风行云, truly like a翩翩欲仙. Before he left, a Jin woman named De Shū吟诗道: "万里倦行役，秋来搜几分；因看河北月，忽忆海东云." The more she looked at the moon in Hebei, the more she must have missed the clouds over the palaces of Haidong (East of the Sea, Hangzhou)? However, she had already traveled ten thousand miles, far away from Hangzhou! Autumn is the easiest time to feel nostalgic, looking back on the past, how could she not lose some weight! Wang Yi and Wang Yuanliang's relationship was of course particularly close. Zhang Shengjie's "Qin Farewell" (see Qing Dynasty Miscellaneous Drama Collection II) writes about the events between the two. In my humble work "Notes on Reading Music," page two hundred and twelve, it says: "Qin Farewell describes the Song Dynasty-Yuan Dynasty Ci poet Wang Yuanliang playing the qin to bid farewell to fourteen female Daoist priests. Recently, Yu Dafu is preparing to urgently print his 'Shuiyun Lou Ci' (Water Cloud Tower Lyrics). Wu Mei said: 'Qin Farewell' is also better than 'Heart's Remaining Wintergreen Tree.'"</p>
<p>Dai Sixiao did not forget the Song Dynasty in anything he did. Even his given name and pseudonym reflect this: "Sixiao" means "thinking of Zhao (the Song imperial family)," "Suonan" means "forever remembering Hangzhou in the South," and "Fenweng" (Angry Old Man) also meant remembering the Song Dynasty. Where he lived, he hung a条, on which was written "木穴世界." Removing the "十" from below the character "本", and adding the "十" that was removed from "本" to the character "穴", it becomes the character "宋" (Song). In other words, the "十" character of "本" is moved down. Placed on the character "穴", it becomes the two characters "大宋" (Great Song). Similarly, he wrote a book called "Da Wugong Shikong Jing" (Classic of Great Non-Labor Ten Empty). What is called "Wugong Shikong" ("Non-Labor Ten Empty")? "空"字"无工" becomes the character "穴"; "穴" plus "十" is still the character "宋". Therefore, the "Da Wugong Shikong Jing" is the "Da Song Jing" (Classic of Great Song). The reason why he wanted to be so roundabout was of course because after the fall of the Song Dynasty, he was afraid of offending the literary inquisition, so he used such obscure language. He lived in Suzhou and spent his time painting when he had nothing to do. He especially liked to paint orchids. When a Han Chinese traitor prefect asked him to paint, it was useless even if he kowtowed and called him "father." If he got angry, he would scold the prefect, making him go away with a face full of shame. However, if the lovable villagers asked him to paint, as long as they secretly put a piece of paper on his table when he went out, and put a pot of good wine and a few dishes, he would drink wine, eat some dishes, and get excited, picking up his brush and painting orchids on the paper. However, the orchids he painted were very strange. Other people's orchids all had roots, but the orchids he painted had no roots. People asked him: "Why don't you paint roots when you paint orchids?" He would sigh and say: "The roots have already been tied up by foreigners! When we recover the lost land, we will add the roots!" Usually, he always sat facing south, and during festivals, he would definitely cry facing south. He put his poetry manuscript "Xinshi" (History of the Heart) in an iron box and hid it in the well of Chengtian Temple, hence the name "Jingzhong Xinshi" (History of the Heart in the Well), also called "Tiemian Xinshi" (Iron-Faced History of the Heart). It wasn't until the eleventh year of Chongzhen that this History of the Heart was discovered. Then, in the early years of the Republic of China, Deng Shi and others established the National Studies Rotary Club and printed this History of the Heart in oil-paper type, in only one volume.</p>
<p>Finally, we must mention the four wintergreen trees, which are the four important figures in Jiang Shiquan's (Xinyu) "Wintergreen Tree" chuanqi opera: Xie Ao, Lin Jingxi, Xie Fangde, and Wen Tianxiang. "Wintergreen Tree" is derived from this. On the other hand, it refers to Lin Jingxi. Wen Tianxiang and the two Xies had characters like the "wintergreen tree," able to withstand the erosion of wind, frost, rain, and snow, still standing upright, forever lush and unwithering. Only Jiang's statement that Jingxi later received冥报 is superfluous. Jingxi has "Baishi Qiaochang" (Singing of the White Stone Woodcutter) in six volumes and "Lin Xiaoshan Ji" (Collection of Lin Xiaoshan) in five volumes, but he is most famous for the poem "Wintergreen Song." This poem is extremely obscure and difficult to understand. I remember that the National Studies Rotary Club published "Notes on Wintergreen Song." Cheng Minzheng's "Song Remnants Record" (Notebook Novel Grand View edition, published by the Civilization Bookstore) seems to also have a volume of annotations. In the Ming Dynasty, Bu Shichen wrote a "Wintergreen Record" chuanqi opera about Lin's affairs, but it has been lost.</p>
<p>Xie Fangde and Wen Tianxiang were from the same hometown, also Jiangxi people, from Xinzhou. He was forthright and read books quickly, remembering everything he read for life. When people talked to him about national affairs, he would often stroke his beard and beat the table, jumping up and acting vigorously. He was praised as "a startled crane soaring to the sky, impossible to cage." After organizing a militia and resisting the Yuan marshal, he failed in Xinzhou and went into seclusion in Jianyang, Fujian, earning a living by fortune-telling, only taking shoes and rice, not taking silver. Several poems about giving shoes and rice in "Dieshan Ji" (Collection of Dieshan, Commercial Press Four Series Collection, two volumes) were probably written during this period. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he was unwilling to come out of seclusion. The Han Chinese traitor Cheng Wenhai insisted for many years, insisting on forcing him out, tying him up like a kidnapped person. He had no choice but to starve himself on the way, eating only fruit, and eventually starved to death in Beijing's Minzhong Temple.</p>
<p>Many people know about Wen Tianxiang's last days, so there is no need to describe them in detail. His life story can be found in Song History, volume 418. There are many modern works about Wen Tianxiang. Commercial Press and World Bookstore have reprinted "Complete Works of Wen Tianxiang." Yang Yinshan wrote "Wen Tianxiang Chronological Biography" (Commercial Press) and also wrote the drama "Wen Tianxiang." Wu Zuguang also wrote a drama "Ode to Righteousness." Yang's work examines historical facts with great effort, but unfortunately it has no performance effect and is not convenient to perform, which is due to excessive adherence to historical facts; Wu's work is mostly inconsistent with official history. I gave a lecture at the Shanghai Drama and Art Society once, specifically commenting on this work, but Wu's performance effect was excellent. Zheng Zhenduo not only rearranged "Zhinan Lu" (Record Pointing South) in the first collection of the World Literature Library, but also took this theme and wrote a novel "Gui Gongtang," and even the junior high school Chinese textbooks selected this novel, which has been widely circulated. Other popular readings such as the "Wen Tianxiang" biography written by Zhang Yiping and Yi Junzuo can penetrate the masses even more. It is said that "Ode to Righteousness" has been set to a new song score, so the dissemination will be even wider. Here, I will only say one anecdote: Wen Tianxiang was arrested at Wuchengling in Haifeng (because he was arrested while eating, so later a Fangfan Pavilion (Dining Pavilion) was built there. Haifeng Middle School was built there, and I taught there for half a year twenty years ago). Zhang Hongfan wanted him to write a letter to recruit Zhang Shijie, but he refused. When he was pressed hard, he only wrote out two lines from his old work "Passing Lingdingyang": "人生自古谁无死，留取丹心照汗青!" (Since ancient times, who can avoid death? Leave a loyal heart to shine in history!) Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to smile bitterly.</p>
<p>Many of the above nine poets have many poems selected in the fourth volume of "Song Poetry Excerpts" (Commercial Press National Studies Basic Series). After "knowing the people," if you want to appreciate their poems again, then reading this book is the most convenient and easy to obtain. I introduced the poems of the last seven in "History of National Literature" (World), which can also be used as a reference. There is also "Research on Late Song Patriotic Poetry" published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, which is also a good book.</p>

<p>— Feicun</p>
<p>The jianghu is old,</p>
<p>But the world feels increasingly unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The smiling faces of elders are nowhere to be found,</p>
<p>The children in our arms push us away.</p>
<p>The steps of "effort,"</p>
<p>Have unexpectedly approached the edge of life's wilderness,</p>
<p>I also gradually have the stinginess of a vagabond at the end of his road,</p>
<p>The years remaining in my hands are few.</p>
<p>Passion has been extinguished by worldliness,</p>
<p>The remaining embers are a pile of sorrow.</p>
<p>Middle-aged dreams are cigarettes and alcohol,</p>
<p>Only they can dry the dampness at the bottom of my heart.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Drizzling Rain <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yun</p>
<p>A few lonely hours slipped away in the tassels of the drizzling rain, how much of life's brilliance has faded away, in the lost, brilliant April, who can withstand the rainy season of the heart?</p>
<p>April's wind is gently hazy, although that cloudless sky is a gray-blue, without the fiery red of the setting sun; nor the magnificent colors of the evening glow, but under the drizzling rain of dusk, I linger, like reading a page of melancholy little poems, lightly, it will let you understand more thoughts!</p>
<p>Let's not speak, quietly watch the waves slowly rise and fall, at that time, it's as if listening to a mystical movement, you will understand the meaning of life's ups and downs, whose life can have a wide and flat road? There are spring and autumn in the years, days full of sunshine, and hours drifting with salty rain, although people are infinitely happy and laugh, but no one can resist the gloomy weeping, even if they can deceive others with a forced smile, but they can never deceive themselves, otherwise they would not feel that the punishment of the soul is too cruel.</p>
<p>Silk-thin raindrops, densely scattered, in this solemn realm, silence can feel a little more intimacy, when the river wind brings a soothing evening bell, a white religious feeling will unconsciously float on the soul, you will lower your head, falling into distant contemplation, that is a vast sea. How much past, how much future, memories of childhood laughter, youthful love, but memories will also return you a little bitterness and a little desolation, if memories give you too heavy a burden, you may shed tears of rain.</p>
<p>People live between hope and disappointment, live between memories and childhood dreams, many past events will evoke solemn memories, but many new hopes will evoke infinite reveries, but hope is always hazy, like the rainy scenery on the river at dusk, covered with a layer of light fog, so faint...</p>
<p>Riverside, in the drizzling rain of dusk, one can gain more profound enlightenment, understand oneself, and also understand life, life will be as erratic as drizzling rain, but don't be too sad, although today there was a drizzle, there was a touch of thin sorrow, perhaps tomorrow, in the warm sunshine, there will be infinite laughter, but, don't forget today's drizzle.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhongtao</p>
<p>The rain feet, high and low, fly ten thousand crossbows. The banana leaves transform into graceful dancers. The sparse osmanthus, wind enters, the lamp sways. In my dream, I hear the spring geese in the reeds. The wine is cold, the incense fades, the dream fades and I awake. The shadows of the jianghu are too fragmented. Unable to sleep, I love to listen to the night watchman's clapper. Tomorrow, I know apricot blossoms will fill the city.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Familiar Shouts <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Bo</p>
<p>Outside the window, the shout of "White Sugar Plums" has started again.</p>
<p>For eight years, I wandered in small cities in the Southwest, where there was no familiar sound. Therefore, whenever the late spring season came, and I felt nostalgic for my hometown, I would think of the plum groves of my home, which were probably full of green plums? Thus, the shout of "White Sugar Plums" would float leisurely in my ears again.</p>
<p>Last autumn, I returned and went to see if the plum groves were safe and sound, but the weeds were ankle-deep, a desolate scene, and I couldn't find any remaining branches of plum trees!</p>
<p>I didn't feel heartbroken or sad about losing the plum groves, because at that time, victory had just arrived, and my heart was burning with an even greater fire of joy.</p>
<p>But, gradually, this joy turned into disappointment, domestic disputes were like this, the people's livelihood was so depleted...</p>
<p>Therefore, when this familiar shout rang in my ears again, in addition to a feeling of intimacy, I also felt infinite sadness; the taste of victory is not the same as white sugar plums, wrapped in a layer of sweet sugar coating, but the inside is still bitter.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Peonies and Phoenixes <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, a teacher said: "The magnificent peonies are not necessarily stronger than the duckweed on the water, and a rooster that crows at dawn is more brilliant than the phoenix, the king of birds." I didn't understand the riddle-like parable, but I sincerely admired that teacher, so I kept his words carefully in my heart, until today.</p>
<p>I dare not say that I am smarter now than before (because I am always stupid), but at least I understand things a little better than when I was a child. People who have visited a chemistry lab will no longer be surprised how a leaf can be turned into a beautiful bookmark. A twenty-year-old naturally knows more about the social situation than a ten-year-old. Why? Is this society so unsatisfactory? Is it presenting extreme deformity? One side is desolate and dark, with no light; while the other side is unusually lively, respectable, and glorious. Why? Perhaps this is a mystery, but one point must be admitted: in the current society, there are really many great people, but the great careers that have been achieved are really too few.</p>
<p>"To aspire to do great things, not to be a great official." The Founding Father said such words, what a short and meaningful lesson! I think there are too many peonies and phoenixes in our society.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Regarding Mrs. York's visit to Beijing, Mrs. Weng had not told Shi Yulou beforehand. Mrs. Weng asked one of Shi Yulou's private qin teachers to write the letter. It wasn't that Mrs. Weng intended to hide it from Shi Yulou, but rather that Mrs. Weng felt that this matter was between her and Mrs. York, and there was no need to ask for Shi Yulou's consent. Moreover, Shi Yulou didn't seem to have time to inquire about this matter. Besides, Shi Yulou couldn't read or write, so even if she told him and he agreed, he couldn't handle this matter for Mrs. Weng. Therefore, Mrs. Weng simply acted dictatorially, but unexpectedly, in a casual conversation, it was revealed by the qin teacher. The qin teacher asked Mrs. Weng why the guest she had invited hadn't arrived yet. Before Mrs. Weng could answer, Shi Yulou pressed her to ask what guest she had invited. Only then did Mrs. Weng have to tell him everything. But Shi Yulou was annoyed. He had been in a bad mood lately, his career was not going well, and his temper had become particularly irritable. So he blamed Mrs. Weng for not telling him beforehand. His reason was that he didn't like guests. On stage, he could reluctantly mingle with many people, but at home, he only wanted to be alone. He loved solitude! Mrs. Weng explained her relationship with Mrs. York, exaggerating how good Mrs. York was as a person, and explaining that Mrs. York was a meritorious figure in helping her and Shi Yulou to get together, but none of this moved Shi Yulou. He had no impression of Mrs. York at all, so she had no interest in her. Because of this matter, they quarreled for the first time, although in the end Mrs. Weng still succumbed, but she was very dissatisfied in her heart. She thought that Shi Yulou wasn't treating her as his wife, but simply as his emperor! Shi Yulou's autocracy gradually made her feel uneasy! She felt oppressed! She also understood Shi Yulou's financial difficulties, but she had taken out some of her own private money to help Shi Yulou. Naturally, Shi Yulou's monthly salary was only two hundred yuan, and two hundred yuan was not enough for her to eat and smoke. For this reason, Mrs. Weng thought that Shi Yulou was afraid that Mrs. York's arrival would increase his burden. In fact, Mrs. Weng herself understood that Mrs. York would not burden them, and Mrs. York might even help them. Therefore, Mrs. Weng hoped even more that Mrs. York could come to Beijing, and hoped that she would come quickly. Whether in spirit or in life, she desperately needed Mrs. York. But she was unwilling to say much to Shi Yulou about this.</p>
<p>One evening at dusk, after Mrs. Weng sent Shi Yulou to the theater, she was feeling lonely in her heart. Suddenly, there was a commotion outside, startling her to rush out the door to take a look. It turned out that Mrs. York and丽华,丽云 had arrived! Immediately, Mrs. Weng was so happy that she jumped up! She rushed over and grabbed Mrs. York's hand, saying:</p>
<p>"Sister, you've finally come! I've been waiting so long that my eyes are almost worn out!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Weng also greeted Lihua, Liyun, especially when she saw Liyun, she felt a pang of sadness, called out "乖 (Guai)," and tears welled up in her eyes!</p>
<p>"Sister! How have you become like this? If you hadn't called me first, I almost wouldn't have recognized you!" Mrs. York scrutinized Mrs. Weng for a while, and the first sentence struck at Mrs. Weng's sore spot.</p>
