<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕政治協商會議預定會期即將屆滿，而三大主要問題，即政府組織，軍隊整編及國民大會猶未解決。據報，蔣主席今日親自出席會議，以期打開僵局，蔣主席昨曾與共黨領袖周恩來直接會商，預料三小組委員會有獲致協議之可能。學生萬人近曾遊行，高喊「政治協商會議必須成功，不許失敗」口號，當由周恩來及孫科保證，該會必然成功。據政治協商會議代表透霹：目前會議將繼續進行，會談情形已有進步，相信憲法草案小組委員會即可成立協定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕政治協商會議今日仍有兩大問題須待解決，其一爲政府改組，其二爲國民大會組織法。關於前者，一般討論，均集中於國務會議之組織及大總統之權力。自十九日以來，並米舉行全體會議，各種問題，均交由小組委員會解決，一部份小組委員會已完成工作，軍事小組委員會一俟將工作交與三人軍事委員會後，即將結束。三人委員會由中央代表張羣，張治中及共黨代表周恩來組成，其任務爲實施大會委員會所成立之協定，政府軍於半年內縮减至九十師，中共軍於三月內縮减至二十師。此外，憲法草案問題委員會亦已完成工作，現將任命各黨聯合委員會，着手修正憲法草案，以使各方滿意。該委員會提議設立內閣制，行政院對立法院負責，由國民大會選舉之。</p>
<p>〔又電〕政治協商會議國民黨代表王世杰，爲謀對國民政府改組案打開僵局起見，今日親訪中共代表周恩來及民主同盟代表羅隆基，提出讓步建議，主張澈底改革政府機構，其內容規定國府委員會議由各黨各派參加後，應賦有任命各部長之權，國府主席發布命令，須由國府會議核准，國府會議三分之二以上人數通過決議案，國府主席無否決權。中共及民主同盟對於此項建議，須俟周恩來與共黨其他代表討論後方可決定。</p>

<p>〔本報北平二十六日電〕執行部官方發言人，對記者剖析目前局勢謂；大局無問題，小衝突尙未消滅。共方發言人稱：執行部十日來調處工作已有顯著成績，俟停止衝突工作完成後，即從事恢復交通，今日執行部無公報發表，據悉，今日有飛機一架飛張家口，明日有飛機一架飛赤峯，本報駐平記者將同往。據共方發言人稱：該地現由中共領導之地方保安隊維持治安。執行部由渝派往豫南羅山之小組，明日可返抵此間該處停戰情形頗佳，大同，集寗刻已平靜無事同蒲路衝突仍甚劇烈，執行部即派小組前往調處。泰安方面尙米收到第二次報告，一部日軍繳械問題，構成該處之唯一結，各處破壞交通事件尙米根絕，此地且傳共軍　克數十輛昨夜出現於平津間黃村車站附近，確否待證。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕山西方面仍有衝突，傳共軍正以大軍　攻聞喜，同蒲路南段曲沃，臨　間亦被破壞，調處部據報後，　準備派一小組分飛太原·聞喜·執行調處。最近共軍襲擊豐台南前後辛莊事，該部調查人員業　返平，不久即發表公報。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕軍　調處執行總部已充實辦事員，以便增派流動小組前往調處地點，聞流動小組將自原定之八組增加至二十組或二十三組。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕路息，此次隴海路黃口李莊間被破壞，短時期尙難修復，因共軍最近破壞之方法，係先將枕木堆積燃燒，再將路軌置於其上，必俟其灣曲而後已，所有燒毀鐵軌已如廢料。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕在這地的烽火裏，綠衣人仍舊穿來穿去，傳遞着天倫情人朋友們的情形。北平區郵政管理局長李質君昨天告訴記者，數年來政府與中央區的郵件遲送，始終沒有中斷過，勝利後八路軍控制區的郵局，已經增加到四十處左右，但是信還普通的，只有包裹無法寄遞，目前不能通車，而几也沒有航綫可通的都市，多繞道而行，譬如北平寄開封的信件，多半以航空遞至南京，再由津浦·隴海以至開封。沒有舟車通達的窮鄕僻壤，都靠步行郵遞。張家口郵政也歸北平郵管區管轄，如果情勢許可，他準備最近到那裏看看，中共曾發行郵標，但數目很小，將來不難整理，現在自共區寄來貼中共郵票信件，暫按欠資辦理。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕財長兪鴻鈞爲視察京，滬區財政金融現狀，前日下午三時許目渝飛滬，記者昨訪兪氏於中央銀行，承發表談話如次</p>
<p>關於新外滙率問題，業經政府愼重研究，將考慮一在振興及發展國際貿易之原則下，擬具妥善辦法，即可公布。對本年度之財政計劃，兪氏稱：將側重於建設，而以復員善後爲中心。然本年度財政如整軍等支出，亦相當浩繁，現決設法整頓稅收，一面並擬利用國外物資，同時謀幣制與物價之穩定，俾預算接近平衡。關於省市地方財政問題，兪氏認爲如欲推行地方自治，必先謀地方財政之充裕，財部有鑒及此，本年度各省市地方之輔助費，已定爲二千五百億元，較上年度增十三倍。中央並將重行考慮劃分國家財政及地方財政，以明收支之領域。關於直接稅之徵收，政府現決定於簡化稽征之辦法下推進，處置務求合理。記者復叩以對証券交易所復業之問題，渠表示証交之設立，對工商企業全融之調劑，裨益匪淺，惟如辦理不愼，反足助長投機，現政府對証交以及其他交易所之復業，均在分別視其需要，作統盤之籌劃。</p>
<p>關於聯合國國際復具開發銀行，兪氏稱：係根據布里頓國際金融協定而設立，不久將在美召集中美英蘇等盟國專家舉行會議，籌備設立，我國對該行基金之負担，已定爲美金五萬五千萬元，屆時將派席德　及宋子良二氏代表出席會議。對台灣方面之財政金融，兪氏認爲台灣淪陷多年，中央對台施政，以安定爲主，故對過去若十有成績之良好措施，將加以保存，將來遂步使之與國內統一。現台灣一切政治經濟措施，均係根據此項政策推進，此番與兪氏聯袂來滬者，尙有財政部錢幣司司長戴銘禮，總務司司長桑錫菁。財政部稽核黃紹慈等。兪氏昨晨曾延見美總領事卓思麟，英財務參贊湯姆遜，商務參事胡階森等，商談外商在滬貿易以及財政金融方面問題。此外並接見財政部京滬區金融特派員陳行，直接稅局長孫照烜，海關副總稅務司丁貴堂，關務署長鄭萊，財政部貨物稅局局長方東及市商會理事長王曉籟等，下午復召見銀行公會徐寄廎，錢業公會劉午橋，聽取本市銀錢業對財政金融措施之一般意見。至五時財政局長浦拯東，中國農民銀行李叔明，亦相繼晉謁，兪氏並定今日召各稅務長官，舉行會議，檢討本市各項稅收稽征辦法，以期有所改進。兪氏預計將在滬勾留三日，廿九日赴京，視察首都財政金融情形，在京將有一週之勾留，事畢即返陪都。</p>
<p>兪財長昨發表書面談話如下：「抗戰勝利以後，本人曾來滬一次，其時復員正値開始，本人留滬爲時雖暫，但聆獲各界人士意見，以爲施政參考，裨益殊多。本人此來，除對於已往財政金融措施詳加老查外，並擬就有關重要問題，諮詢各界意見，以備參考，而收集思廣益之效」。</p>

<h3 id="c11">凌鴻勛抵平　商修復鐵路 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十五日電〕交次凌鴻勛本日下午四時由京飛抵北平。據談此來係爲解決恢復華北交通問題，停留時間未定，修復鐵路經費，政府已有準備，但器材問題，亟待解決，善後總署救濟物資中，雖有一公里之鐵軌枕木，但迄今並未運來，緩不濟急，必須向己想辦法。津浦南段已決定拆除京無路鐵軌枕木補充，津浦北段是否亟需拆除關外鐵路補充，刻尙未作最後決定。目前枕木之急需與恐慌，猶甚於鐵軌，因鐵軌不易被毀，雖被移去，亦可設法找回，枕木則拆去，即被當柴燒爲灰燼。凌氏明日即在此召集鐵路有關部門，舉行會議</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕徐州訊：交通部次長凌鴻勛在徐聽取隴海津浦兩路主持搶修工程人員施工報告後，曾謂目前中國各路所有工程人員，集中於津浦平漢兩路，從事搶修工程不難，但使各路現有之器材，集中用之於搶修上述兩路破壞之各段，殊非易事，因人員較易集中，而所需之器材，則不易一呼而得。凌氏以須具有最大信心，鼓勵員工，並舉中國之開路巨人詹姆佑壯史為勗勉。但據工程人員談，今日拯救中國鐵路交通之厄運，已使盡一切令人難以置信之辦法。挖肉醫瘡，拆京蕪路已見之矣。千里送枕，將枕木運諸千里以外，更難數計，倘使言人終能克服一切困難，而橫梗鐵路沿綫之軍隊，遲遲其行，修路工程，恐非短期所能竣事。</p>

<h3 id="c45">「揚子江之啊夢」快要實現了！　宜昌興築大水閘　結合我理想與美國經驗的空前建設計劃 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 原文載一月二十日花旗報</p>
<p>長江，一名揚子江，它是中國運輸的生命綫，灌溉的源泉，也是生命與財富無情的推殘者。它發源於西載東北拔海三英哩之處。</p>
<p>這條全長三千二百哩的長江，正是世界有數幾條長河流之一，湧過中國心　，流經重慶宜昌間上游的山峽，然後穿越人口稠密的盆地，經上海而傾入黃海。</p>
<p>中國對於利用這條大江有一個夢，要在三峽東端，宜昌附近，奔騰的江水開始流綏而分散的地方，把它納入掌握，以便使用它的力量。</p>
<p>中國在獲得美國的協助與鼓勵之下，開始在那裏計劃起世界上最大的水力計劃來。美國的田納西流域水利工程處（TVA）與墾務處各項計劃，曾控制了洪水與灌溉，發慶了水力，並使區域性的工業與農業計劃實現。中國就根據了自己的理想與美國的經騐，在擬具一個空前的公共工程。</p>
<p>水利開發　將變爲億萬人之福</p>
<p>宜昌水閘，將是世界最大的一個堅固水閘。它產生的水力較現有世界最大的大涸谷水閘（Grand　Conlee）大五倍。這水閘形成一個二百五十哩長的蓄水池，容量達五千萬畝呎，較波爾特爾（Boulder）水閘大兩倍。</p>
<p>揚子江的水利工程，已仿同美國的TVA，被簡稱爲「揚域安」（TVA）。它興築時，各支流與黃河都將建立水閘。按黃河因泛濫害人，曾以「中國之禍」出名。中國政府通常把揚域安稱爲薩凡奇計劃，因爲關於這計劃的初步報告係由大涸谷，波爾特爾與夏斯達等閘的設計者薩凡奇（John　L．Savage）所作，薩氏以美國墾務局的設計工程師著名於世，一九四四年應中國政府之邀於國務院支持下，在中國勾留過一個時期。</p>
<p>工程艱鉅　掘開山石打穿地道</p>
<p>計劃規定在宜昌掘開山石，打成開道，在地道裏設一發電廠，發電量一千萬　，當比大涸谷，波爾特爾與夏斯達三處電廠的發電量的總和尤大。</p>
<p>揚域安永力發電，除供給以水閘所在地爲中心三百哩半徑所及的區域以外，還可以高壓電綫，東通南京，西連成都，南接貴陽，北及天永，因此它所影響到的人數，當較美國全部人口爲多。不但長江的灌溉得以改良，而且江水常年提高，大洋輪船也可以開到距海岸六百五十哩的重慶。再如加掘數百哩運河，千萬畝的土地可以獲得灌溉之利。洪水即使不能完全消滅，在七十萬方哩土地之內，當不致造成水災。</p>
<p>水力運用　將比戰前美國更大</p>
<p>由於中國內爭不息，及多年戰爭影響，上述一切都還只是一個希望。但是唯其因中國的赤貧，迎頭趕上，尤有必要。希望原是存在於激劇改革之中。只要加速全國性的工業化，農業改良與更迅速的運輸等計劃之後，它們才能開始實現。</p>
<p>爲了使中國這一個巨大的工程計劃實現，若干步驟已經開始進行。中國目前實在沒有一點水力發電的設備，但它可資運用的水力，實比戰前美國遠大，它的發展足以在這個以人的臂腿爲主要力源的地區，克盡無限的任務。</p>
<p>一九四五年十二月，中國資源委員會已撥付美國內政部墾務局二十五萬元，以支付揚域安計劃上所需的最初費用。這次撥款，係按所訂合同進行，合同規定：墾務局的工程師，負責擬具運河網與水閘的計劃。計劃工作本身，大約還需要二十五萬元。</p>
<p>設計預算　由中美工程師進行</p>
<p>墾務局將致力於各種爲發展大河本身及其五個主要支流所需的工程與經濟方面的研究，包括水閘與電力廠的位置，以及河流與整個流域發揮最大作用的建議。墾務局的工程師將負責製作各種模型，水力模型的測騐，準備各種設計圖樣，營造書，與用費預算。一部分工作，將由中國政府給予薪水，在墾務局丹佛爾辦事處美國工程師輔道下工作的若干中國工程師，地質學家與經濟學家進行。</p>
<p>揚域安工程的　費，完全是中國自己的事情。美國內政部長伊克斯已經說過，合同上只規定了披術的協助，並不涉及其他。工作的完成，也許得化十年到廿五年的功夫，估計開辦費代價，在十萬萬至十五萬萬美元之間。據「密勒氏評論報」所刊孟長冰先生文內所作估計，時間當需十年。水閘，船塢與水力發電廠等建築，需十三萬三千萬美元。此外揚子水閘附近各主要工廠的建設，需二萬萬美元。中國的經濟學家說，如果中國能取得日本的生絲貿易，美國當可借與十四萬萬美元，中國在十年之內將該款歸還。如此則中國生絲運美的商務，一定要十分興盛，並使每年達到一百四十萬美元才行。</p>
<p>鞏固邦交　强化國際經濟安全</p>
<p>自然，中國所有建設計劃，都遭逢到經費的問題。最重要的一點，不是有無困難，而是現在工作已經着手進行。中國也許不能像美國人一般迅速地開山闢地，但是事情不能只問什麼時候完工，而袖手旁觀所辦得了的。伊克斯說過：協同的努力是國際諒解的又一環節。</p>
<p>他又說：「合同是鞏固中美邦交的又一個步驟。我頗以墾務局能承担這一艱巨任務為榮。局內各工程師，已因在西部各州發展了水利，聞名於世，他們時常應聘，與外國政府合作，進行這種開發計劃的設計與技術工作，因而加强了經濟安全。我以爲這是促進國際諒解的最實際的方法。</p>

<p>（五）孔雀明王窟：中有一像極美坐於孔雀上，窟門上有題字爲慕寫宋黃山谷書體。此時山谷逝去已九十多年。字體已嶙峋風格，遠非蔡京輩可比。</p>
<p>（六）羅漢窟：有宋宣和四年題記，世人每謂十八羅漢，實爲十六羅漢，此窟數量極大，因非一時所造。</p>
<p>上地藏窟：此窟爲伏元俊所鐫，司怛因西域考記內，亦有此像，稱爲乞又底　婆，而不稱地藏，此像綫條粗擴，如繪畫中之大寫手法。</p>
<p>（八）觀音無量壽經變窟，內刻印度王阿屠世囚父故事。釋迦說法，洞外有十六觀造像記，爲乾寧三年所建，右旁有供養人三列，上列十四人皆戴烏紗，中列亦十四人，皆戴戴帕頭，下列十二則全爲女像，皆着巾幗。又據重修記云：陳紹玽與妻黃氏，爲淳化五年之亂，求佛許願而妝繪此像。另有一龕，有經幢一，上刻陀羅尼經，另有造像一龕已燬，惟記爲宋大觀年三年，其字仿爲宋徽宗之瘦金體。</p>
<p>（九）多寳塔：爲宋馮大學所建。中有涅槃像，但佛已不存，門上刻伏小八鐫。</p>
<p>（乙）寳頂山：全部造像爲南宋趙智鳳一人所建，自承唐柳本尊稱爲趙本尊。始建大寳樓閣，繼而造像，其中有一巨佛傑，半身長六丈餘，涇槃像前有弟子，頭側戴田拱立者，是護法韋現。另有一方塔，爲藏經之所。此爲密宗道塲造像之藝術價値，不如北山，惟示敎意識，甚爲濃郁。</p>
<p>一般對造像之看法，每以愈古者愈有價値，鄙見不然，蓋造像初創之期，仿人規模，諸多幼稚，殆至成熟之時，其作品乃自有面貌。我國造像之成熟時期，在晚唐，五代，北宋，道玄之畫，關係極大，而大足北山正爲此期作品，故爲至有價値。北宋以後，則呈衰頹之象，且石刻造像，此時已少，因此項工做艱苦，不如范銅泥塑容易，我們此次發現伏氏一門造像四人，表而出之，甚爲愉快。今以時間所限，述說大略，至於詳細歷史背景以及造像藝術評論，將來再談。（完）</p>

<p>編輯先生：我是一個被敵僞壓迫八年，又被共黨拘押一月的烟台一個小商人。我無黨無派，更不是資產階級。在抗戰期間，我很同情魯東共產黨。但自共黨統治烟台後，我才深切的認識了他的眞面目！他高唱民主，實際他比大皇帝還專制。我這篇稿子，完全是記實。我是近由共黨的根據地牙山，海陽，平度，掖縣，走了半個月，跑到靑島，取道連雲港徐州，到了上海。所見所聞，這篇稿子，僅寫了十分之一。因爲到上海，體騐到江南人士因爲憤怨不肖官史的貪汚，竟有同情共產黨者，他們沒嘗過共黨的滋味，無怪其然了。我懇切的希望您將這篇稿子登出來，令魯東旅申的人士得知故鄉的情形，令江南尤其上海的人們認識認識共黨的德政。</p>
<p>烟台的流亡者鞠躬。一月十七日。</p>
<p>自日寇無條件投降後，魯東共軍，即開始攻城掠地，於八月十六日陷牟平，十七日陷福山，十九日陷蓬萊。偽登州道尹兼烟台市長白書，接得普蔣委員長「謹守原防維持治安」命令後，集合各縣警備隊及游擊隊孫振先王志善匡玉洲各部，不下萬餘人，保衛烟台，械精糧足。共軍以二團兵力配合民兵萬餘人，於入月二十日開始進攻烟台。白逆初尙率隊抵抗，詎知二十三日日寇奉令撤退，登輪而去，二十四日白逆於前綫戰鬥正酣之際，携其愛妾朱娟紅，登汽艇潛逃，致全軍崩潰，僅孫振先部千餘人突圍而出，橫穿共區，轉　至乳山口，登民船得至靑島，餘均被俘。共軍自據烟台後，燒殺捕掠，無所不用其極。八年來在敵偽蹂躙下之民衆，膏血盡枯，今又罹共軍之茶毒，十室九空，將來恐非數十年不能恢復原狀。茲將共軍「德政」　列於左：</p>
<p>（一）刧掠物資</p>
<p>共軍入烟台之第二日，即開始刧掠。日商三井，三菱，岩城，三友，德商盎斯，萬豐，德純，德孚，　臣，及日德意僑民數百家之公私財產，悉被沒收外，盟邦美商美孚亞細亞之火油二萬箱，汽油數千箱，　璜頂美國醫院之全部醫藥器具傢具，及英商仁德永興之機器物資，亦均被刦掠一空。查當太平洋戰事爆發，盟邦撤僑時，所有物資，均列單經各該領事交與日領，日寇對於盟邦私人商業之財產，全部封存，而共軍竟悍然不　，每日以騾馬千餘頭，大小車二千餘輛，連續月餘，始運究畢，準備銀行及各銀行所存偽鈔不下十億萬元，亦被掠去。烟台較大之工廠商店，如瑞豐火磨，永康，炳蚨，造鑛工廠，張裕，醴泉釀酒廠等，五十餘家，均加以通敵罪名，予以沒收。富有之住戶，被民兵午夜砸開大門，將室中所有洗掠一空者，不下百餘戶。商民之無綫電匣數千個，均被勒交出，有不繳者，以反動論。又以每疋抗幣一千二百元之價，將全市所存之白細布二萬餘疋，悉數强買而去。</p>
<p>（二）殺人放火</p>
<p>美國內地會位於烟台海濱，佔地三十餘畝，建有精美樓房六百餘間。愛禮甘堂建於東山西坡，於九月二十六日夜九時，被共黨以地雷火油，付之一炬，延燒至一晝夜之久。事後美　到烟質問，被諉爲國民黨特務所放，於獄中捉一死囚槍決塞責。共軍到烟以來，假借民衆大會名義所殺之人，計有邵子敏，郭尙古，金馨滋，于鴻儒，錢樂起，王晋，常平侯，祁元振，劉國斌，祁世琨等二十餘名。涉國民黨嫌疑而被暗殺者，更難以數計。最慘者市立二中學生高某徐某，（名未詳），於講堂上，曾發不滿共黨之言論，翌日即橫屍於毓璜頂南坡之溝中，身被十餘創，血肉狼籍，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>（三）濫捕人民</p>
<p>共黨之公安局設有鋤奸科，數月來，被其逮捕者，不下萬餘名，凡士紳，公務員，職敎員，坊閭長，及智識，資產，統治階級，無一倖免。地痞流氓組有人民糾察隊，工人車夫組有工人武裝大隊，農民小販組有人民武裝部隊，均有逮捕人民之權。彼等捕得人犯，必遂所欲，始獲釋放，否則即送於公安局。十月間因美軍有登陸之訊，公安局之鋤奸科設於牟平山上黃家，及王橋莊兩處，人犯積有百餘名，即於午夜由烟台押送至以上二處。其禁閉室，設於鄉民之祠堂，地上舖有亂草，集數十人於一室，門首有警士二名，持槍監視。早六時起床，盤膝枯坐，不准活動。凡吸烟、談話、打盹，均在禁例。夜八時就寢，即翻身、撓癢，亦須報告，違則餉以槍把。廣華池經理朱子玉，因夢中說話，被吊於樑上一晝夜。被押之人，百分之九十染有皮膚病。因押人過多，半月始能過一堂。問供時，漫無目標，以忠實坦白相誘，錯捉決不錯放，即無辜之良民，亦須拘押月餘，再發往牙山縣受兩個月之訓，方能釋放。八年前之商會會長崔葆生，及現任商會董事王潤生·林秋圃·高漢千·劉鵬飛·王儀三·　紹武等二十餘人，均發往膠東軍區，判以三年至十年之徒刑。海關及交通機關人員，均拘於萊陽。筆者因兌換北鈔，（即抗鈔，彼定北鈔一元換準備鈔八十元，實際僅値十元，）被拘月餘，親歷其境，獄中風味，不不减夜台。曾作打油詩數首，茲錄其一：「動敲脛骨睡敲頭，盤膝終朝作楚囚。除却向陽捫端外，更無一事得自由！」</p>
<p>（四）慘酷之鬥爭會</p>
<p>共黨宣傳，被所行者爲「新民主主義」，則共產主義，尙隔一層社會主義，現在決不共產，而實際則彼以鬥爭會代替共產。凡稍有資產者，皆須「被鬥爭」。每於開鬥爭會時，集合一村或數十村之人於會塲，「被鬥爭者」被迫立於高棹之上，須陳叙自身或上數代之罪憑，即無事實，亦須順其意旨，隨便編造，其黨徒則分佈於每個角落，督促民衆攻擊侮辱。「被鬥爭者」如不應其要求，輕則以糞尿灌之，命名爲喝「反省湯」，或剝得赤身露體，以棘枝抽打，命名爲「搔癢」，重則以麻繩縛足，由村民沿街橫拖，命名「拉洋耰」。以是「被鬥爭者」除家產蕩然外，十分之九已被凌辱而死。烟台之商家，被鬥爭者百餘家。磚瓦公會會長王孟臣，芝罘屯村長孫乃普，菜市塲職員施竣概，均因鬥爭，被打得體無完膚。市立醫院醫生王茶之妹（醫院看護），因其兄潛逃，共黨將其捉至體育塲鬥爭，硬指其曾生私子，非脫下褻衣，騐騐不可，當夜羞憤而死。牙山徐家店區有一林姓老處女，其父母兄嫂皆去世，她撫其幼姪度日，村幹部亦開其鬥爭會。其叔年逾不惑，出而袒護，被共黨將其剝得精光，跪於八仙桌上，其姪女剝得僅穿一小褲，立於其旁，老翁不數日氣憤而死。最慘者，離徐家店二里之某村，（村名已忘）張得功，因鬥爭被橫拖而死，其二子悲憤哭駡，當塲雙雙被活埋。噫！此等事不知毛澤東周恩來諸先生聞之作何感想？</p>
<p>（五）破壞廉恥</p>
<p>共黨爲籠絡血氣方剛之士兵，挑各縣之有姿色之婦女，組織「婦女姿色救國隊」。每攻一據點，獲勝後。即由該隊慰勞。由上而下，輪流洩慾。徐家店村之婦救會，尤爲著名。筆者行經其處，曾聆其請歌「婦救會，眞落後，上娘家，騎牲口。咦呀哎嗐么，但說害羞不害羞？」四月間開會時，曾有二名會員，當塲產子。煙台鋤奸科科長胡某，科員馬某，部下均有丰姿妙曼之女黨員二名，每夜輪流伴宿，醜聲四溢。煙台現劃爲六個區，五十八村，每村設有婦女救國會，所有十四至五十歲之婦女，均須參加，晝間站崗，夜晚開會。稍有姿色者，常被指導會留至午夜始放歸。夫不能管其妻，父不能管其女，稍有間言，即以反動論罪。</p>
<p>（六）誣辱委座</p>
<p>共黨代表在協商會上口口聲聲承認蔣主席領導地位，而其部下則每於開會時，誣詆委座。種種侮辱，不忍詳叙。民衆莫不氣憤塡胸。煙台十五歲至五十歲之男子。皆編爲自衛團及担架隊，時時集合，天天調練，共他谷縣之壯丁，則早編爲民兵，驅上前綫，中途逃亡，如被捉回，十九處死。讀黃炎培先生之一延安歸來」，內稱共黨民兵皆出自願，眞欺君子可欺以共方。現其區人民禁止出境，甲村到乙村，雖一里之遙，亦須通行證，如到中央區，非市政府公安局或營團部以上之通行證，則寸步難行。現萊陽靈山拘留逃亡出境之人民不下六百餘名，法網之密，手段之毒，較日寇猶勝十分，魯東之民衆，盼中央軍之來臨，如大旱之望雨，但盼望數月之久，踪影全無，　　　而　　　矣！（烟台的流　　）</p>

<h3 id="c52">上海電力公司工潮平議 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>近來上海工潮，迭有發生，而以最近上海電力公司工潮爲最嚴重亦最複雜，社會人士非常關切。誠以國家方慶勝利，生產亟待複興，勞資協調，急起直追，猶恐不及，豈容冉因工潮而多所停頓？尤其電力爲一切工業動力之源，市政公用事業，以此爲首屈一指。猶幸工人深明大義，聲言決不使電力供給有所停頓，否則影響生產，何堪設想？不過即此最近數天的僵持，已使電力公司的工潮成爲社會議論集中之一事。工友們如果用意全在經濟，應該於自身要求之外，默察一般人對於諸君日來行動的感想如何。我們站在報人的地位，博訪周路，綜合各方的報道，願對最近工潮，平心靜氣的提供一些意見，希望政府當局和勞資雙方，加以考慮。</p>
<p>勝利以還，陸績發生的工潮，其原因不是　業工　請求復工或呼籲救濟，就是在業工人要求增加工資，改善待遇。平心而論，在物價高漲，生活艱困的情况下，靠薪工度日的職工，開門七件事，確感應付不了，一旦失業，或賦閒稍久，自漸無可支待，結合呼籲，人情之常。　於目前尙有職務的職工，也因爲按月所領工資，與生活指數的昇高，不甚相應，或且距離過遠，乃受物價高壓的鞭策，紛紛作改善待遇的要求，原亦無可厚非。所以，就一般而論，工人在此時無業者要求有業，有業者要求增資，社會淸議，毋寗于以同情。若資方漫不加察，一味不理不睬，或且高壓對付，實非計之得者。</p>
<p>可是，同情工人的要求是一事，工人是否應該動輙罷工乃是另一回事。從事工人運動的人，以及工會的領導份于，應深深的看淸楚這一點，切莫以爲工人旣可要求什麼權利，就不妨隨時用罷工手段來達到目的。稍一不愼，濫用　武器　（指罷工），昔之同情者或可轉爲厭惡。我們次不是說，工人絕對不可以罷工，我們毋寗承認在民主國家，工人於必需時自有共罷工的權利。不過，須請工界同胞注意，一個國家總應該有法律，尤其民主國家更須重視法雜，工人運動當然應納於法律軌道之內。勞資爭議，如何處理，國家自有法律規定，政府也有明令佈告，先由勞資雙方自行磋商，磋商不成，則可聲請政府主管機關依法調解，調解不成，更可呈請上級主管機關進行仲裁，而仲裁之時且有法團代表參加，次不虞其偏頗。如必不得已而罷工，亦惟有歷經調解仲裁，均無效果，資方頑固，故意壓迫，甚至並仲裁裁定的辦法亦不接受，勞方在合法途徑走完碰璧的時候，忍無可忍，纔不得已而用共最後武器，以罷工爲保障其合理要求的手段，如是，則罷工縱爲不祥的名詞，還多少可以得到社會人士的諒解，或甚且可以受到同情的支援。反之，若徒恃羣衆的力量，以罷工怠工爲惟一方法，合法程序，絕不一顧，甚至主管機關出而調解，拒不出席，一再通知，亦傲不答復，或反而要求必須由資方派人到工人羣衆隊伍裹去，方可談判，如上海電力公司工友們最近之所爲者，我們殊覺於法於理，都未免有些過分，實在替他們可惜。若論到他們所提要求條件的內容如何，却是另一回事。他們的要求，縱使全屬合理，此種做法，此種態度，也斷非社會人士所樂聞。</p>
<p>即就上海電力公司工潮而言，聞自去年九月以來，就時斷時續，社會局調解已非一次。據勞方散佈文件，亦稱訂有協定，而資方則更向政府聲明願意接受當局所決定之工資表，在理應更無多大爭執，何至再有前四天之突然怠工？公用局報告，該公司最低工資，乃依工人生活指數逐月調整，較敵人投降前已增加十餘倍，比之一般公敎人員，母寗說是此善於彼。故增加工資一層，宜已無大問題。若說裁撤職員，則或爲臨時職工，或爲犯有過失，依理評斷，亦應可以解次。勞方所認爲懸案未次者，當英過於同職同薪，及戰時慰藉金等事。不知戰時慰藉金這些名目，究從何而來？若說慰藉，全國人民除了漢奸而外，那個不要慰藉，但慰藉何能僅實之於資方？聞所提要求，動輙每人數十萬元，試爲工廠設想，豈能勝此擔負？假使各業羣相效尤，則我們敢說上海工廠不但停頓者將無可復開，即已復工者亦必感不能支持，橫流所屆，工業家必裹足不前，誰復願意再行投資生產事業？在近視者以爲此乃爲工友爭權利，而實則無異爲工友斷生路！至於中外職工，同職同薪，原爲合理，自然希望政府與資方盡力向此目標努力辦去，惟上海環境特殊，各部門工作技術，其間或亦不無參差，故過去慣例，欲圖變更，亦須逐步調整，何可一蹴而幾？此種積習，並非不可打破，且亦應促其打破，但此事儘可由政府作主，或雙方從容商酌，况調解仲裁，程序上富有進行餘地，工友們亦何必爲此而用怠工罷工等方法，僵持下去，求一朝一夕之解次？所以，爲工友計，爲社會計，工會領袖此時均宜依法接受政府之調解，或進而聲請政府爲公王之伸　，　工　　　萬不宜再為無理由之延　。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者：怠工罷工固　工人的　　，但怠工罷工亦應出於工人的自願。怠工罷工容爲法律所許可，但公用事業職工的怠工罷工却爲法令所禁止。因爲公用事業，全市人民生活所繫賴，如可率爾怠工罷工，勢必影響於全市人民。至於工會若干人士，用組隊糾察，禁止工友出入的方法，以强制維持其怠工的命令，是則不但表示此種怠工原非全體工友之本意，（否則何以須禁止他們出人？）抑且剝奪一般工友之自由，而民主政治所最重視的個人自由意志，則更被拋置於九霄雲外的了！總之，我們同情電力公司職工若干合理的要求，希望資方相富容納，尤希望政府依法調處，但我們同時對於職工的拒絕調解，强迫怠工，則認爲不是民主國家工友應有的作風，亦非遵守國家法律，尊重個人自由者所應有的態度。要求工潮的正當解次，斷非用此種手段可　　成。電力工潮如此，其他工潮亦如此。</p>

<h3 id="c53">電力工潮在僵持中　當局決合法處理　主管人員報撲哧調處經過　錢市長昨晚招待新聞界 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>（本報訊）近日來本市工潮此呼彼應，閙得「滿城風雨」，各界有識之士，雖對工人要求在若干程度下甚感同情，然對目前工潮的趨勢，動態及勞方的行動甚表關切。昨晚錢大鈞市長招待新聞界負責人，坦白的對各記者闡述最近工潮全面的狀態。</p>
<p>錢市長特介紹幾位處理勞資料紛實際負責的長官報告本市工潮情况，報告的有市黨部委員王先靑，公用局長趙曾珏，社會局勞工處長李劍華，社會部駐滬特派員陸京士。</p>
<p>開除沈涵查係偷電</p>
<p>目前工潮情形趨勢最惡化的是上海電力公司的怠工運動，自發生至昨日已有四日，綜合昨晚招待席上報告，工潮的背景甚形複雜，據王先靑氏報告說：怠工的「近因」是電力公司方面開除了一個工會理事沈溷，開除的原因是：該工人藉公司職員的地位偸電。公用局方面以第三者公正的立塲，將案情付諸正確的調查，所得的結果是：沈涵確有偸電的嫌疑。此外怠工的第二「主因」是：電力公司因工作上一時無需要，故將臨時工人數名解僱。</p>
<p>勞方條件達十餘款</p>
<p>王先靑氏在得到怠工的消息後，即赴楊樹浦發電厰與工會領袖協商，以求謀得迅速公正的解決。勞方所提的條件共有十餘項，其中値得注意的是：（一）資方任免職工須得工會同意，（二）公司須立即「撤裁」勞方「黑單」所提的高級職員十四人，勞方說這十四人是「頑固份子有　　撥勞資雙方之惡感，」（三）公開公司行政，（四）本年內「不合理」的加薪一律推翻，（五）撥發「戰時慰藉金」每人四十萬元。（電力公司工人總數是二千餘人）</p>
<p>公用事業不得怠工</p>
<p>王先靑氏在楊樹浦工會代表商談的時候，就表示各項條件似有越出範圍的，惟無論如何，各項條件皆須從長商議，况政府一再公告公用事業職工不得怠工罷工，因此王氏即勸各工人先行復工，並保證被開除職工沈涵偸電事實若不屬實，則當由公司方面恢復其工作。王氏因與各工會代表談話未得結果，故即向全體工人二千餘人勸導復工，據王氏昨晚報告說：最初情形很良好，然因少數人鼓動，致又引起極緊張之局面。</p>
<p>封閉廠門其勢洶湧</p>
<p>由少數工人的煽動，二千餘工人羣起要求公司代表來廠和工人談判。當時並要挾王氏用電話通知資方代表來廠商談，當被王氏拒絕。各工人即將發電廠大門「封鎖」，聲言：「工潮一日不解決，大家就一日不出去！」王氏被工人「看守」有數小時之多，直至晚間經較和緩的工友的勸導，始將王氏釋出。昨晚在招待席上，王氏報告此次調解經過，出席的人都覺得在此民治法治聲中，電力公司工人不顧民治最主要的條件「身體自由」，而將王氏扣留，皆表示極度的遺憾。</p>
<p>公司待遇比較良好</p>
<p>在王氏報吿調處經過之前，趙曾珏闡述電力公司工人的待遇，趙氏所發表的數字使出席招待會的都覺得電力公司的待過，似較前一般情形優越。趙氏報告電力公司最低工人待遇是：</p>
<p>八月份，僞幣四十五萬元（合國幣二千二百五十元）。</p>
<p>九月份，國幣七千八百元（較八月加三倍半）。</p>
<p>十月份，國幣一萬二千元（較八月份加五倍强）。</p>
<p>十一月份，國幣三萬二千元（較八月份加一四倍）。</p>
<p>十二月份，三萬元（較八月份加一三·四倍）。</p>
<p>據趙氏說：電力公司工資的調整是依照生活指數，而調整的措施甚速。他說：</p>
<p>八月份生活指數：三三二，</p>
<p>九月份生活指數：九二二，</p>
<p>十月份生活指數：四四一，</p>
<p>十一月份生活指數：一〇二一，</p>
<p>十二月份生活指數：九四五，</p>
<p>趙局長並指出：戰前電力公司最低薪給是二十六元，依此數計算，十二月份的薪給用生活指數算，應爲二萬四千元，然目前實際薪給是三萬元。</p>
<p>所提要求影響至鉅</p>
<p>趙局長又稱：電力公司美商負責人在一般情形下皆能遵從我市政府督導，而關於調處工資問題亦皆能依照市政府規定。此次工人怠工情形及所提之要求，間接的影響是使外人對我國的投資起相當的寒心，同時亦將使國人對於停業的工廠復業不敢着手。</p>
<p>當局希望合法合理</p>
<p>社會局勞工處長李劍華報吿數月來勞資糾紛的數字，他並說明：政府對於處置勞資糾紛是採取保障工人的權益，依照法令秉公處理勞資間題。對工人或資方無理的態度及要求亦須以公正之立塲加以料正，李氏並說敵偽時代憲兵隊用暴力壓制工潮，而今日政府的方式是民主的，用調解仲裁去謀解決。他希望勞方能深刻的明瞭這一點，在行動程序方面處處能顧到法治的精神，而不越出民主性的方式。</p>
<p>妨害自由不合民主</p>
<p>陸京士民報吿說：電力公司有一個工人向他報吿全體工人皆被數少主腦份子「拘留」在廠中不准出入，有很多人已有幾天沒有水飯吃了。陸氏指出：此種方式，妨害行動自由，是不合民主主義最主要條件的。他並說：政府的立塲是秉公約處理各項糾紛，並要顧及全國工業的發展，使勞工運動不殃及我國急需的工業化的進展。</p>
<p>萬不得已有效處置</p>
<p>末了，錢市長鄭重府對於電力公司工潮仍將秉和平，合理，合法的辦法去謀解決，然在這種情形下，仍謀不到迅速的解決，則政府旣有禁止公用事業工人怠工罷工的命令在先，市府必將採取斷然有效的處置。</p>
<h3 id="c54">外報紀述各業工潮　有共黨份子操縱　示威遊行顯有背景 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>英文大美晚報二十六日載稱：本市牽涉二萬名工人之工潮，並非單純生活費增高問題，而係較此更爲嚴重之問題，關干此點，業經大美晚報向各方探悉後，予以證實。許多方面均認爲每一工潮，均係由激烈份子所操縱。據稱在楊樹浦方面舉行之工人大會中，曾佈置列寗旗幟與紅旗。</p>
<p>此間國民黨工作人員，遵守重慶之指令，在勞資糾紛中，均採取守勢，但激烈份子（包括紅色與粉紅色份子）則利用協商會議之進行而採取攻勢。</p>
<p>據考查結果：顯示此種示威，係由共產黨在幕後牽綫。在最初幾次之遊行中，示威者曾提出要求美軍回國之口號，此點爲示威具有政治背景之另一證明。</p>
<p>各業工潮大部解次</p>
<p>本市洶湧澎湃之罷工工潮，現已逐項解決，中紡公司十七廠、商務印書館，及理髮業，昨已復工。怡和紗廠之風潮，亦已於前晚九時，由社會局代表召　勞資雙方，在該局談判。決定每人發遣散費一萬六千元，終止僱用關係。因該廠之機件大部爲日方搬去，損失極巨，一時無法復工。遣散費則于下星期一開始散發，規定於兩星期內發淸。逾期不領者，作自願放棄論。雙方認爲滿意，乃圓滿解決。</p>
<p>電力工潮調解未成</p>
<p>電力公司風潮仍在僵持中，職工二千八百餘人，迄仍鵠集於總廠，病倒者已有百餘人，昨晨十時，社會局召集勞資雙方調解，勞方以在職工大會中決定必須該公司大班法來斯親到總廠談判，代表無權推翻大會決定，故拒絕至社會局談話。下午社會局市黨部派代表會同五大公用事業代表，至楊樹浦電力公司總廠向全體員工勸解，不得要領。</p>
<p>頤中公司勞資協商</p>
<p>頤中烟草公司自盟方接收後，現已有一部份復工，在太平洋事變前，該公司職工每月由廠方扣發百分之五薪工，作爲儲蓄金，現該廠工人要求廠方將該項儲畜金一次發淸，但未發生怠工罷工情事，昨經社會局調解，資方對原則上已接受，但對發還該項儲蓄金之加倍數，未能確定，現尙在硏討加倍辦法中，惟於年終前由廠方每人發給一萬元。</p>
<p>百貨工潮可望解次</p>
<p>永安，先施，新新，大新，麗華，中華，友信九大百貨公司之怠工風潮，昨日下午四時，由社會局勞工科張科長，召集勞資雙方調解，雙方代表到三十餘人，會塲情緒極爲融和，最後勞方表示爲誠意接受調解，願將提出要求之職員待遇三萬五千元减少五百元，爲三萬四千五百元，膳食仍由公司供給，資方表示可按照工資評議會評定之生活指數包括膳食以月薪三萬元發給，以後則每月遵照評議會評定之指數發薪，至深晚九時，雙方條件仍未能接近，資方代表並以勞方條件，相差過遠，須請示公司當局決定，張科長乃定於今晨十時在該局繼續召集雙方代表調解，務期於今明日內完全解決。</p>
<h3 id="c55">各界迎送國軍 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>

<p>以忠恕心行仁義事</p>
<p>隨即遞給你一份紅色的特刋，於是你走進禮堂，坐下來一邊喝茶，一邊細細翻閱，上面的祝壽詩文稱得起字字珠玉，開頭就是王先生親書的「述我六十」四個大字，再下去他寫：「以忠恕心、行仁義事」。今後的六願：「做未做之事，發未發之言，讀未讀之書，遊未遊之地，償未償之願，了未了之債」。不等你再看下去，童子軍已經奏起音樂，台下坐滿了等人，主席團與壽翁先後登台，行禮如儀後，劉鴻生、李石曾、楊嘯天等十餘人先後致賀詞，無不强調王先生在國家社會上的重要性，並祝他永遠健康。</p>
<p>王曉籟正在致謝詞</p>
<p>十子從軍兒孫道謝</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕十年前因日水兵中山秀雄被暗殺一案繫獄至今之楊文道，於昨日始見重復自由之一綫曙光。本市高院於昨晨傳楊子漢枝訊問一過，下午楊之義務律師庸懷　又代遞一狀，請求高院迅開合議庭准予保釋，廣東旅滬同鄕會董事勞敬修等，於昨日下午開會之際，已準備一切担保手續。</p>
<p>昨晨九時半，高院刑庭劉毓桂庭長特傳楊漢枝訊問，楊漢枝當供稱：年二十七歲，廣東中山人，因父楊文道於十年前被誣繫獄，至今未獲重見天日，要求先行保出，就醫。</p>
<p>劉庭長旋即論吿：楊文道因中山秀雄案於二十五年十二月九日經前江蘇高二分院判次維持死刑原判，楊於上訴最高法院之後，即因戰事發生，始終未獲確定，卷宗亦未發還，去年九月，勝利來臨，楊文道曾向三方面軍司令部呈請按照政治犯例開釋，三方面軍即將本案移交本院。十月卅一日，曾將楊文道提出詢問，但最高法院旣未有所決定，本院自未便有所表示，且原判死刑，足見案情重大，本院不能破例准予保釋，遂於十一月一日電司法行政部請示，但至今未奉部令。十二月十日，楊文道又呈請恢復自由，翌日即由本院批示，「已向司法行政部請示核辦。」本年一月十七日，漢枝又呈請將其父先行准予保釋，二十一日批示，因卷宗尙未發下，且未奉部令，未能辦理。一月二十三日高院已再電司法行政部請示，因恐聲請人不明情由，故特開庭諭告。劉氏又謂，今後一方面仍應聽候司法行政部訓令，一方面聲請人可狀請國府請求援政治犯例開釋，如此則司法與行政方面並進，或可謀早求解決之方。</p>
<p>唐懷羣律師起立謂我人於日軍俘虜且以寬大處之，而對此愛國同胞偏加禁錮，今日不特本律師願意擔保楊文道，即當庭十餘新聞記者，全上海四百萬人民，亦莫不願爲楊文道擔保也。</p>
<p>劉庭長繼謂此事情形重大，應開合議庭審理，囑再補狀申請，而即於昨日下午三時半唐律師之申請狀已送達高院，據唐律師告記者，彼信楊文道於陰曆年底以前，有出獄可能。</p>

<p>電影與戲劇信與望  吳永剛　　大地回春，萬象更新，國產電影似乎應於一切新氣象中進入新階段中，回溯具有卅年歷史之國產影業，在過去草創　　時代，以技術落後，劇本內容陳舊，以致幾不齒於愛好國產影片之觀眾，厥後，漸由於工作者之力圖上進，國產影業始有一線生機，迨抗戰軍興，國軍西撤，上海淪為孤島，民營之國產影業亦漸由高人之手而淪入蔽偽之手，而隨同西撤之國營影業，亦以國際交通線之被切斷而感物質上之困難，以故荏苒八年，所產之影片，寥若晨星，未能　愛好　片觀眾之望，又過去影片劇本之取材，往往失之不嚴謹，而寫作方面亦僅能　之為美片之複製品，於今，抗戰勝利，建國途中，為國產影業之前途計，當勿再以內容陳腐之民間故事，或以能製殖民地文化為自足，應另闢途徑製作真真中國民眾所需要之影片，始為上策。　　建國之始，一切有待於民主，而真真為中國民眾所需要之國片之產生，亦有待於民主政治之開展，始克有望。讀「萬世師表」  羅盤　　承你借給我萬世師表的劇本，很是謝謝。　　花了半夜的功夫，一口氣就看了，這是我看　的脾氣，而尤以這書使我不忍釋手。我在讀劇本，我也在溫習我的家世。祖父做了四十年的小學敎員，父親到今年也當了快十年的教授了。幾十年來，我們所接觸的就是這些不被社會所重視的人們，所從事的正是人所不屑為的工作，在八年抗戰中，我們熬過了物質和精神上的種種苦難。讀了劇中人的遭遇，我不僅是感動，而且是深切地和他們共鳴了。　　老教授方義　說：「許多人只是把教書當作一個飯碗，一個升官發財的臺階罷了，但教育不是一個職業，不，教育是個事業，一個終生的事業。只有把教育看作自己終生的事業的，才配得上談教育，才負得起教育人民的責任，……」是的，教育應該是一個事業，一個建設心虛的事業。可是在今日教育工作已成為眾所共知最沒出息的職業的時候，要找一個願以教育為終身職業的人都不易，又何來把教育當作終生的事業的人。曾有一個朋友冷冷地說過：「今日還在教書的，都是一班沒有生活的人。」身為教員的人聽了這話，也不免有一種無法自解的悲哀於是一個個都想離開學校，做任何事總比吃教書飯強些。　　所以我覺得從事教育工作的人，是不能僅以得到精神上的酬報，得到從青年那裏來的信仰和熱情就感到滿足了。要真正負起教育人民的責任來，我們不僅要苦守崗位，而且也得爭取我們應得的權利，去排除一切阻礙教育發展和壓迫教育的現象。我們不能讓以後的教育工作者，還是在饑寒交迫下，在精神的壓迫下，去苦苦守住他們的崗位。從五四到的抗戰，從方　　教授到林桐教授，以教育為事業的人們所受到的待遇，可說沒有什麼進步。幾十年來，許多人是有信心地堅強地苦撐下來了，但以後不要再苦撐，以後應該努力地開發。劇本上雖沒有說起管聲洪和小柔的事業如何，但我個人以為他們的事業，一定是超過過去二代的。　　對於劇本，作為一個外行是沒得什麼說的，就外行的見地講，我覺得劉家軍的出塲雖增加了塲面的熱鬧，但對於整個戲的氣氛，不免受到破壞。而第四幕的紀念會，假使不予演出，似乎更為含涵一些，使觀眾更多思索和回味。您以為如何？　　聽說中電劇團在舊歷新年就要上演這劇本了。那時我一定要約家人朋友，一起去看一次，讓我們看到自己熟悉的人物活在舞臺上，再咀嚼一下過去的生活，為劇中人悲嘆和感奮，也為自身悲嘆和感奪。祝好。戰後蘇聯藝術  影泉　　戰爭以前，蘇聯對於藝術各部門，可以說什麼都能注意到。而這其中對電影與戲劇的推選，更不遺餘力。戰爭以後，蘇聯對於藝術方面，當然不曾忽視，現正竭其全力，加以重整。　　（一）戲劇　關於戲劇方面，當戰爭期內，蘇聯的演劇工作，並未中止，祗是把劇塲賞等撤離到安全的地點，在前線較遠的地方上演而已。自戰爭結束後，所有撤離的劇塲演員，都相繼返回。那些　有的戲院劇塲，毀損者修理，全損者重建，更預備築造新的劇塲，訓練新的演員。而演劇中心，仍舊在列寧格勒那邊已有七個大規模劇塲，上演各種劇本了。　　（二）電影　過去，我們知道蘇聯的電影作品，另有風格，戰爭期內，蘇聯曾築中人材，拍攝宣傳片，新聞片，紀錄片一類，故事片較少。但對於抗戰工作，影片曾予全蘇民眾以相當的鼓勵。到了戰後，蘇聯的影片，當然也要重量整一下，所有的攝影塲，經過一度整頓後，也先後開拍新片了。關於故事的取材，目前仍偏重於抗戰英雄故事，納粹暴行狀況等為多數。而同時，在第四度五年計劃開始之期，蘇聯的影片，當仍不忘幫助政府促進全國的工業化呢！兒童電影，正和戰前一樣的重視。　　（三）音樂　最後我們要一說的便是音樂，近來蘇聯當局對於音樂藝術的興趣非常濃厚。新的音樂人材，包括作曲家，歌唱家，在戰爭幾年中已產生了不少。各地常有音樂會的舉行。關於曲譜，不但過去的名作逐一採用，新譜的也有不少。而莫斯科和列寧格勒，有許多戲院，是決定經常上演樂劇或歌劇了。這一切，都足反證音樂藝術，在今日的蘇聯，是一新氣象呢！介紹「聯合新聞」  新方　　「聯合新聞」（United　News）是第二次世界大戰的產物，而是在這次戰爭中電影界最大的貢獻。在今日，銀幕上一卷卷的「聯合新聞」，可以告訴我們這次西洋戰爭是怎樣進行關，納粹是怎樣的殘酷；但結果卻是被消滅的；同盟各國是怎樣的越險履艱；而結果是獲得了最後勝利。在明日，「聯合新聞」的價値真可以與歷史文獻相　的。我們是同盟聯合國國民，我們在「聯合新聞」中看到自己的情形·自己的地位；當然「聯合新聞」創製的經過是我們——每一個中國人民應該知道的。　　在太平洋戰爭未發生前，新聞片在美國原是由各影片商分自攝製的。如米高梅的「時代的進展」即其一例。自一九四二年起，由美國政府贊助，新聞片即展開了合作的攝製，負責者係五家美國最大的影片公司；他們聲明決不以營利為目的，以其定名「聯合新聞」這一點，更可以知道他們合作的精神，他們以集團的力量襄助國家進行反法西斯納粹的戰爭。在前線·在後方·在太平洋·在大西洋·在德蘇戰爭中·在日美戰爭中他們派遣了最佳的攝影師跟隨着他們祖國的軍隊。一寸一分此次同盟各國用血肉換來的勝利，有了「聯合新聞」的創製，是又留了一個永久的紀念。　　據估計：「聯合新聞」自創攝迄今，大約在一星期內可以完成一卷；當每卷完成後即由美國空軍運輸隊輸送至國內外各地開映，由於輸送的敏捷，其觀眾每週竟達一萬萬之夥。聯合國人民看後是有笑有淚；而最希奇的是曾為納粹勢力下的地方，一度亦聞映　「聯合新聞」，納粹的人民並且因此而感悟到法西斯主義的確可惡，這真是「聯合新聞」的最大收獲呢。還有一點需特別提出的是「聯合新聞」有十六國語言說明，在中國放映的及最近在上海我們看到的，都是用中國國語說明的；用了十六國的語言，每一個民族是可以瞭解這新聞片的。同時亦是給電影界開了一個新紀元了！　　「聯合新聞」是戰爭中的產物，隨着戰幕應消已臨開始復員的時候，攝製「聯合新聞」內容的轉變是必然的。美國國務院與各影商最近決定了這樣一個計劃，他們要保存這種好計構，好組織；可是今後他們攝新聞片的方針已以宣揚世界和平為最大的目標，我們待着瞧吧！攝影塲消息　　吳永剛：忠義之家　　「中電」導演吳永剛已抵滬，並帶來了一個新劇本呌「忠義之家」，吳氏抵滬後未嘗休息，便與「中電」二廠廠長徐蘇靈討論開工問題，聞一切都很順利，大約舊歷年關一過，便可動手。從此，上海的攝影塲，又將重新活躍起來。且並聞「中電」二廠方面，準備二組戲同時開拍，吳導演的「忠義之家」一上手，接着就有另一組戲跟着開拍了。致於是誰的戲，目前有關方面尚不願透露消息。　　又訊：「氣壯山河」導演何非光之新劇本「蘆花翻白燕子飛」，近已改名為「新中國之誕生」，業經政治部通過。過聞定於二月一日開拍，演員內定有「氣壯山河」之男主角王豪與本市名演員劉瓊等，現王豪與攝影師姚士泉，劇務周光先等多人，已於上月初離渝，日內即可到達，女主角則尚在物色中，猶未決定云。　　何非光：「新中國之誕生」「願負完全的法律責任」  唐突　　戲劇界前輩洪深先生最近在重慶又做了一次獅子吼，他提出許多「事實」，並聲明「完全的法律責任」聞時還引用了法律刑事第三百幾十幾條，因之，通訊記者對於洪老夫子的「控訴」頗表同情，而對洪氏發言時的描寫則為「聲淚俱下，極為沉痛」云云。　　我們雖然遠在上海，無緣親聆到洪先生的高論全文，但他老夫子當年在上海為了「不怕死」事件而所表演的不怕死精神的重演，我們還可以想像得到的。洪先生是能編會導善演的全能人才，所以不僅發言動聽，而且表情深刻，因此立刻引起了戲影界相當的波動。　　但是最遺憾的是洪老夫子此次發言所得的資料不很正確，更有若干「不求甚解」的先生們以為引證洪先生的所說「事實」，這下可以大做文章了，於時以訛傳訛，甚至故意誇張煊染，而弄得像煞有介事的樣子。　　我之所以說洪先生所得的資料不很正確，是因為真正的事實與他所「控訴」的並不相符。歸納洪先生的講話，計為：　　（一）捐稅方面對於冬令救濟捐的附加「幾年來究竟收過多少」，「如何分配使用」未知公佈而表示不滿，因而斷定「三分之二酬勞了經辦的政府官員」於是推論這便是「苛」「雜」。這和因嚥廢食同樣的不必，假設有不肖的「官員」營私舞弊，或是「未加公佈」，這只是經辦人的道德態度與工作效率問題，「冬令救濟」事件本身無可非議的，自然算不得「苛」「雜」。　　（二）「檢查人敲竹杠看白戲」也是少數執行者的道德問題，因了少數人的非法而攻擊檢查制度也是不公道的。　　（三）關於中央電影服務處（不是服務「社」）的身份，中央宣傳部代表羅學漮先生曾有詳盡的說明，所謂「特務統制」的查問也就變成了「無的放矢」，再說「製片自由發行統一」的口號，姑不必研討是否合理，據我所知，電影服務處卻並示喊過這兩句口號，洪先生或因傳聞之誤，而況為一談了。　　（四）「敵偽影片公然在重慶演出」，這更是危言聳聽，我們知道政府曾一再命令偽片不準映演，堂堂陪都，尚有幾萬觀眾可以證明，重慶從來也未有偽片映過，至於一口咬定有「中央電影廠」來這些偽片拍片頭，瞞騙觀眾，這確是法律問題了，如果「中央電影廠」當事人願意多事的話，這會引起一塲官司來的。　　（五）「曾落過水的身份不明的影戲人，政府依然重用」，洪先生并且說明這個人還當了上海市立戲校校長，自然是指的顧仲華，但是顧先生是不「曾落過水」的　　我們素來敬重洪先生，尤其對他那種妨惡如仇與說話負責的美德深表欽佩，不過我們更希望洪先生在發言之前能夠冷靜地仔細地檢閱攷證一下所搜集得來的資料才好。好萊塢大事  李木　　頃據好萊塢電訊稱，一九四五年度電影界之最重大新聞事件是華納公司的大罷工最有教訓意義的是「真正的光榮」The　Trne　Glory。將是一切影片中之最佳選。最佳的戲劇藝術影片是「布魯克林之樹」A　trea　Growsin　Brooklyn　。最佳的音樂片，關於陸軍的是「一個美國兵的故事」The　Story　of　G.　l.　Joe。關於海軍的是“They　Were　Expendable”最精心製作的是「失去的週末」The　Lost　Weekcnd。　　最轟動一時的好消息是瓊克羅馥又回來演了一張片子名呌“Mlildred　PIerbe”最驚人的消息是的塔海華絲（筆者按即近在滬放映之「桃花宮」女主角）與她的丈夫繼爾斯的離婚。最壞的片子是Solome　Where　she　Danc最盛大的結婚禮是香蘭鄧波兒和約翰阿格中士結婚。最動人的婚姻是白考爾和墓費鮑格。最重大的商業事件是國際與環球電影公司的合資經營。最藝術化的影片是「南方人」The　Sontherne　rJ　　男明星中表演最優的是傑木斯鄧在「布魯克林之樹」中·女明星中表演最優的是殷格瑞柏格曼Ingrid　Bergman在“Bells　orSt.　Mary's　一片中。最重要的男影星是格瑞高瑞派支。最重要的女影星是珍格瑞恩思。好萊塢最著名的市民是大嘴男明星周伯邱，最佳的笑片是「呦談」Kiss　and　Tell。最有希望的樂隊是斯丹肯通樂隊。　　最重要的工業趨勢為獨立製片的增加。最好的消息是克拉克蓋柏爾，　倫寶華，羅伯泰勒，傑木斯都華，羅柏孟格曼等男明星的從軍歸來。最不重要的消息是神密女郎　波或將再演一片新影片或者將不演。最佳的短片是「夜之星「Star　in　the　Night。最動聽的是「春光無限好」，State　Fair　中之歌。最佳的希望是一九四六年的和平與繁榮。新片三部　　環球公司最近由美運到新片「生逐刦」Destiny　係描寫一涉世未深惑於女色之少年竟甘心受蕩婦驅使淪為匪盜後終因另一真情愛人所感化而脫變成為青年極富有社會教育意識最近即將在本市滬光戲院公映。　　派拉蒙影片公司新出品企鵝諜影已運抵重慶該片由保勃　甫斯與梅德玲卡洛爾聯合主演　情極為滑稽。　　米高梅公司歌舞五　，　片「出水芙蓉」為名演員列史凱爾頓去年度最佳傑作著名喇叭　手哈利占姆斯首次參加演出極為精彩該片即由　　　　　　　　　　「西廂記」和「文素臣」  辛之　　近日渝滬報端時常刋有偽片改頭換名　充　　影片映演的批評文章，並有人具體指出了「西廂記」與「文素臣」二片是偽片，但依本人所知事實並非如此。　　「西廂記」影片是依據文藝名著「西廂記」改編而成的，該原著亦名「會真記」，這個熟習的故事內容自無庸再加介紹。該片是柳中亮昆仲創辦的「國華影片公司」出品，是一部很早的古裝國產片，女主角是周　，完成於民國二十九年十月間，此時上海尚未淪陷。至於「文素臣」影片生共有四集，是「合眾影片公司」的出品，這個公司遠在抗戰以前不結束了的，第一二兩集是劉瓊和王熙春主演，第三四兩集的男主角則改由李英扮飾了，當民國二十六年的時候即已攝製完成，該片亦係古裝，內容採自民間小說「野叟驟　」，是描寫民間不滿當時朝庭因而帬起抗爭的故事，劇中主要領導人物雖為文素臣，但情節卻是描寫帬眾的活動，所以改名為「草莽英雄」到是相當確當的。　　我們如果知道了以上的事實之後，便明白這二片攝製完成的時間是在敵人尚未佔領上海租界以前，其與民國三十年十三月八日以後　偽控制上海時所製之偽片顯有分別也。連得兩項金像獎之　勝利之歌　勝利之歌　Yankee　　Doodle　Dan　y為詹姆斯賈克奈改變作風的唯一傑　。此片寫美國著名劇人，作曲家喬治考漢一生盡瘁戲劇的事蹟，賈克奈已往演的是「暴徒」一類的角色，而在這裏，則又是一副面具，無論跳舞唱歌，以及內心表演，都顯得尋常出色，且因此而得一九四三年電影藝術學院最佳演技的金像獎，片中音樂亦得最佳金像獎。此片現由巴黎金門兩院於二月一日起仝時獻映，該兩院亦自此片起改為頭輪影院，專映好萊塢首輪名片，日內已粉刷一新，觀瞻上亦極壯麗云。保羅茂尼在　「指曉攻擊」中  萊明　　自和平以來，滬上獻映的虞事影片，實在太多了，至於本片，亦是一部激發愛國情緒為題材的戰爭片，不過在此片，由歌倫比亞公司厚用一代藝人保羅茂尼為主角，及導演聖手約翰法勞，這是與其他戰事片不同之處。　　故事本身，述在挪威境內一帬英國遊擊隊，活動於納粹佔領區內的英勇激鬥悲壯史，保羅在本片中，扮飾挪威當地的一個安分的天文學者，時因納粹在挪威境中，壓迫人民，於是他投筆從戎，一變而為一激烈的愛國者，而且加入了英國在挪威的遊擊隊中，從事為祖國而爭鬥的工作，終於他達到了襲擊納粹空軍基地的使命，除保羅外，還有女星安娜李，及影壇名角麗琳甘許，西特立克等，都具有生動的演出。　　關係保羅茂尼，本人以為値得向觀眾們推薦的，他是一個影壇的老將，一提起他的大名，他的沉着，堅定的丰采就會呈顯在每一個人的眼廉，在過去每一部作品中，大都為歷史名人之類的影片，（如「時代的進展」「錦繍山河」「大地」「左拉傳」等）但在「人海寃魂」一片中，他首次改變為悲劇的角色，能博得好評，被一般人所稱為「一代藝人」之名，他沉毅的演技，在好萊塢沒有第二人可勝及；這一代藝人對於中國人的眼光中，最早就以「亡命者」和「大地」二片的印象最深刻了，最近自好萊塢傳來一個開拍「孫中山先生傳」而有他担任國父，這一重要角色的消息，想必有更偉大的絕技，這亦是繼「拂曉攻擊」後又一驚人的傑作，我國人且耐等待着它的獻映罷。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Small Group Discussions Continue; Negotiation Conference Extended for Three More Days; Drafting of the Constitution to Undergo Revision <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference's subcommittee on the Commission on the Resolution of Disputes, the Government Organization Group, and the Political Program Group held meetings on the morning of the 26th. The Political Program Group reached an agreement and concluded its work. The Comprehensive Committee convened its second meeting in the afternoon. Furthermore, it is learned that the Government Organization Group and the National Assembly Outline Group are scheduled to meet on the 27th to continue discussions. The term of the Negotiation Conference was originally scheduled to end on the 26th. However, the general meetings of the Government Organization and National Assembly subgroups have not yet reached an agreement and need to continue negotiations. It is learned that Chairman Chiang has notified an extension of the conference period by three days, with the closing ceremony to be held on the 29th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] The scheduled term of the Political Consultative Conference is about to expire, but three major issues – government organization, military reorganization, and the National Assembly – remain unresolved. It is reported that Chairman Chiang personally attended the meeting today in hopes of breaking the deadlock. Chairman Chiang had previously held direct consultations with Communist leader Zhou Enlai. It is expected that the three subcommittees will be able to reach an agreement. Ten thousand students recently marched, shouting the slogan "The Political Consultative Conference must succeed, failure is not allowed!" Zhou Enlai and Sun Ke assured them that the conference would certainly succeed. According to representatives of the Political Consultative Conference, the current meeting will continue, and there has been progress in the talks. It is believed that an agreement on the establishment of a subcommittee on the drafting of the Constitution can be reached soon.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference still has two major issues to be resolved today, one being the reorganization of the government and the other being the organizational law of the National Assembly. Regarding the former, general discussions have focused on the organization of the State Council and the powers of the President. No plenary meetings have been held since the 19th, and all issues have been delegated to subcommittees for resolution. Some subcommittees have completed their work. The Military Subcommittee will conclude its work once it has handed it over to the Three-Man Military Commission. The Three-Man Commission is composed of central government representatives Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Communist representative Zhou Enlai. Its task is to implement the agreements reached by the General Assembly Committee. The government army will be reduced to ninety divisions within six months, and the Communist army will be reduced to twenty divisions within three months. In addition, the Constitution Drafting Committee has also completed its work and will now appoint a joint committee of various parties to begin revising the draft constitution to satisfy all parties. The committee proposed the establishment of a cabinet system, with the Executive Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan, which would be elected by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Additional Telegram] Kuomintang representative Wang Shijie of the Political Consultative Conference, in an effort to break the deadlock on the government reorganization plan, personally visited Communist representative Zhou Enlai and Democratic League representative Luo Longji today, offering a compromise proposal. He advocated for a thorough reform of government institutions, stipulating that after representatives from various parties and factions participate in the State Council Committee, they should be empowered to appoint ministers. Orders issued by the Chairman of the National Government must be approved by the State Council Committee. The Chairman of the National Government has no veto power over resolutions passed by more than two-thirds of the State Council Committee. The Communist Party and the Democratic League must wait for Zhou Enlai to discuss this proposal with other Communist representatives before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Conflicts in Various Regions Not Yet Eliminated; Mediation Groups to Be Increased; Five U.S. Liaison Officers Obstructed in Chifeng <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] An official spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters analyzed the current situation to reporters, saying: "There are no problems in the overall situation, but small conflicts have not yet been eliminated." A Communist spokesperson stated: "The Executive Headquarters' mediation work has made significant progress in the past ten days. Once the work of stopping conflicts is completed, we will proceed to restore transportation." No communique was issued by the Executive Headquarters today. It is learned that one plane flew to Zhangjiakou today, and one plane will fly to Chifeng tomorrow. Our newspaper's correspondent stationed in Beiping will accompany them. According to a Communist spokesperson, the local security team led by the Communist Party is maintaining order in the area. The group dispatched by the Executive Headquarters from Chongqing to Luoshan, Henan, will return here tomorrow. The ceasefire situation there is quite good. Datong and Jining are currently peaceful. Conflicts on the Tongpu Railway are still very intense, and the Executive Headquarters is dispatching a group to mediate. No second report has been received from the Tai'an area. The issue of disarming a unit of Japanese soldiers constitutes the only knot there. Incidents of disrupting transportation have not been eradicated. It is also rumored here that dozens of Communist soldiers appeared near Huangcun Station between Beiping and Tianjin last night, but this remains to be verified.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Conflicts continue in Shanxi. It is reported that Communist forces are attacking Wenxi with a large army. The Quwo and Linfen sections of the southern Tongpu Railway have also been damaged. After receiving the report, the Mediation Department is preparing to dispatch a group to fly to Taiyuan and Wenxi to carry out mediation. Regarding the recent Communist attack on Xinzhuang, south of Fengtai, the department's investigators have returned to Beiping and will issue a communique soon.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department has increased its staff in order to dispatch more mobile groups to mediation sites. It is reported that the number of mobile groups will be increased from the original eight to twenty or twenty-three.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 26th] The government yesterday issued another statement accusing the Communist Party of deliberately disrupting the implementation of ceasefire orders by the front-line groups of the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters. A telegram from Jinan stated that a unit of Japanese soldiers, en route to Jinan to await disarmament, was still intercepted by Communist troops. The Communist troops stated that they must consult with higher-ranking officers before they could accept the orders of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 26th] Five U.S. Marine Corps pilots flying to Chifeng on a mission to contact the supervisory team of the Military Mediation Department in that area were obstructed at the Chifeng airfield today by Communist soldiers holding Japanese rifles, preventing them from making contact with the team members. The U.S. delegation among the supervisory team members dispatched to Chifeng consists of ten people. After the Soviet army withdrew, the Chifeng area came under the control of the Communist army. This is the first time a plane has landed at the Chifeng airfield since the Soviet army left. The reporter was the only American correspondent on the same plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th] Colonel Lake of the Jinan subgroup of the Military Mediation Executive Department, along with government representative Tu Xuwu and Communist representative Chen Shuting, urgently went to Tai'an again on the 24th to effectively mediate the renewed conflict there. Upon arrival, they first had thorough consultations with Communist Commissioner Ran, and Deputy Division Commander He Xike at the railway station, and obtained their understanding. Colonel Lake and others then went to the city to negotiate with the government troops. Our side replied with an absolute and sincere guarantee that they would not fire the first shot. The repeated occurrence of conflict was caused by the Communist army's violation of good faith and repeated attacks on the National Army. In response to this conflict, the National Army has repeatedly tolerated the situation and remained under siege, resulting in numerous casualties. Under Colonel Lake's mediation, the two sides jointly decided on the following measures: (1) Maintain the current military posture and prevent further conflict. (2) Each side guarantees that it will never fire the first shot. (3) Other issues should await orders from the Executive Department for mediation. Colonel Lake, seeing that the residents of Tai'an were starving, also transported 500 bags of flour from Jinan and requested the Communist representatives to notify the Communist army at the station to allow the flour to be transported into the city to relieve the famine. The Communist army agreed to do so, and the residents were overjoyed. Colonel Lake and others completed their work in Tai'an and returned to Jinan on the morning of the 25th. They then flew to Yanzhou at 11:00 a.m. on the 25th, together with government and Communist representatives, to continue negotiating the overall cessation of hostilities with Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army. They are scheduled to return to Jinan on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 26th] The Seventh Military Executive Group, consisting of seventeen people, flew from Jining in eastern Suiyuan to Gui Sui at 4:00 p.m. on the 25th.

<h3 id="e3">Grain Problems of Han Merchants <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 26th] The rising grain prices were once suppressed, but a fundamental solution still awaits proper planning. The issue of military grain procurement has sparked heated discussions in recent days. Elders from Hubei, such as Ju Zheng, have even sent telegrams of reproach, using stern language. The Provincial Provisional Assembly recently invited representatives from the party, government, and military, as well as local gentry, to hold an unprecedentedly large symposium to conduct frank discussions. They generally agreed on the following: (1) Military grain procurement is unavoidable, but they hope to reduce the amount slightly and provide fair prices. (2) The burden of prisoner-of-war grain is too heavy. The 160,000 Japanese prisoners of war in Hubei should be repatriated immediately.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the interruption of the railway, the destruction of the section between Huang Kou and Lizhuang on the Longhai Railway will be difficult to repair in the short term because the Communist army's recent method of destruction is to first pile up sleepers and burn them, then place the rails on top of them until they are bent, rendering all the burned rails useless.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Postal Service Between Government and Communist-Controlled Areas Has Never Been Interrupted in Recent Years; Postmen Move Tirelessly Through the Flames of War <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] In the flames of war in this area, postmen in green uniforms still shuttle back and forth, delivering news of family members, lovers, and friends. Li Zhijun, director of the Beiping Postal Administration Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the delivery of mail between the government and Communist-controlled areas has never been interrupted in recent years, although it has been delayed. After the victory, the number of post offices in the areas controlled by the Eighth Route Army has increased to about forty. However, only letters can be delivered normally; parcels cannot be sent. Currently, there are no open roads, and few cities have air routes. Therefore, mail often takes a roundabout route. For example, letters from Beiping to Kaifeng are mostly delivered by air to Nanjing and then by the Jinpu and Longhai railways to Kaifeng. Remote areas without access to transportation rely on postmen walking on foot. The Zhangjiakou postal service is also under the jurisdiction of the Beiping Postal Administration District. If the situation permits, he plans to visit there soon. The Communist Party has issued postage stamps, but the number is small and will not be difficult to sort out in the future. Currently, letters sent from the Communist-controlled areas with Communist postage stamps are temporarily handled as underpaid mail.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Yu Hongjun Discusses Financial Plans: Stabilizing the Currency and Prices; Determined to Rectify Tax Collection and Utilize Foreign Materials; New Exchange Rate to Be Announced Soon; Central and Local Finances Will Be Re-Divided <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, in order to inspect the current state of finance in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, flew from Chongqing to Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Yu at the Central Bank, and he kindly made the following remarks.</p>
<p>Regarding the new exchange rate issue, the government has carefully studied the matter and will formulate appropriate measures, considering the principle of revitalizing and developing international trade, which will be announced soon. Regarding the financial plan for this year, Yu stated that it will focus on construction, with post-war recovery and rehabilitation as the center. However, financial expenditures for this year, such as military reorganization, are also quite large. He has now decided to find ways to rectify tax collection, and at the same time, he plans to utilize foreign materials and strive to stabilize the currency and prices, so that the budget is closer to being balanced. Regarding the financial problems of provinces and cities, Yu believes that if local autonomy is to be promoted, local financial resources must first be enriched. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has set the subsidies for provinces and cities this year at 250 billion yuan, an increase of thirteen times compared to last year. The central government will also reconsider the division of national finance and local finance to clarify the scope of revenue and expenditure. Regarding the collection of direct taxes, the government has now decided to promote simplification of the collection methods, and the handling should be reasonable. The reporter then inquired about the resumption of operations of the stock exchange. He said that the establishment of a stock exchange is of great benefit to the adjustment of industrial and commercial finance, but if it is not handled carefully, it will only fuel speculation. The government is now separately considering the need for the resumption of operations of the stock exchange and other exchanges, and is making overall plans.</p>
<p>Regarding the United Nations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Yu stated that it was established according to the Bretton Woods international financial agreement. A conference of experts from the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other allied countries will be convened in the United States soon to prepare for its establishment. China's contribution to the bank's funds has been set at US$550 million. Xi Dezhen and Song Ziliang will be appointed as representatives to attend the meeting. Regarding the financial situation in Taiwan, Yu believes that Taiwan has been occupied for many years, and the central government's policy toward Taiwan is mainly to maintain stability. Therefore, good measures that have been successful in the past will be preserved, and in the future, they will be gradually unified with the mainland. Currently, all political and economic measures in Taiwan are being promoted based on this policy. Those who accompanied Yu to Shanghai this time also include Dai Mingli, director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sang Xiqing, director of the General Affairs Department. Huang Shaozi, an auditor of the Ministry of Finance, and others also accompanied him. Yu met with U.S. Consul General Trussell, British Financial Counselor Thomson, and Commercial Counselor Hu Jiesen yesterday morning to discuss issues related to foreign trade in Shanghai and finance. In addition, he also met with Chen Xing, the financial commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Beijing and Shanghai areas, Sun Zhaoxuan, director of the Direct Tax Bureau, Ding Guitang, deputy director of the Customs, Zheng Lai, director of the Customs Administration, Fang Dong, director of the Ministry of Finance's Commodity Tax Bureau, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In the afternoon, he also met with Xu Jiqing of the Bankers Association and Liu Wuqiao of the Money Dealers Association to hear the general opinions of the city's banking industry on financial measures. At 5:00 p.m., Pu Zhengdong, director of the Finance Bureau, and Li Shuming of the Agricultural Bank of China also paid their respects. Yu is scheduled to convene a meeting of tax officials today to review the city's tax collection methods in order to improve them. Yu is expected to stay in Shanghai for three days and go to Beijing on the 29th to inspect the capital's financial situation. He will stay in Beijing for a week before returning to the provisional capital.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yu issued the following written statement yesterday: "After the victory of the war, I came to Shanghai once. At that time, the restoration was just beginning. Although I only stayed in Shanghai for a short time, I listened to the opinions of people from all walks of life, which were very helpful for policy-making. This time, in addition to conducting a detailed review of past financial measures, I also plan to consult with people from all walks of life on important issues for reference, so as to gather ideas and benefit broadly."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Minister Zhou Yichun accepted an invitation from President Song to go to Beijing at the beginning of this month and returned to Chongqing on the 26th. During his stay in Beijing, he conducted a detailed inspection of the main agricultural institutions in the area. The North China Agricultural Experiment Station on the western outskirts of Beijing, the central institution for enemy and puppet agricultural research in North China, has been taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and established as the Beiping Branch of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute. The estimated operating expenses for this year are 500 million yuan. It is reported that President Song has agreed to allocate funds and has first allocated working capital. In addition, the enemy and puppet North China Reclamation Company has a large amount of reclaimed land in the Junliangcheng, Chadian, and Luanxian areas, using electric power for large-scale irrigation to grow rice. There is also a Cotton Production Improvement Association to develop the cotton industry in North China. Minister Zhou has decided to establish specialized institutions to continue these efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Ling Hongxun Arrives in Beiping to Discuss Railway Restoration <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Transportation Minister Ling Hongxun flew from Beijing to Beiping at 4:00 p.m. today. He said that his visit was to solve the problem of restoring transportation in North China. The length of his stay is undecided. The government is prepared to fund the railway restoration, but the problem of equipment needs to be solved urgently. Although the relief supplies from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration include one kilometer of rails and sleepers, they have not yet been transported here, which is a drop in the bucket. We must find other ways. It has been decided to dismantle the Beijing-Wuhu railway tracks and sleepers to supplement the Jinpu Railway. Whether it is necessary to dismantle the railway tracks outside the pass to supplement the northern section of the Jinpu Railway has not yet been finally decided. The urgent need and panic for sleepers are even greater than for rails, because rails are not easily destroyed, and even if they are moved, they can be found. Sleepers, on the other hand, are dismantled and burned as firewood and ashes. Ling will convene a meeting of relevant railway departments here tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Xuzhou Dispatch: After listening to the reports of the personnel in charge of the rush repair projects of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways in Xuzhou, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Transportation said that it would not be difficult to concentrate all the engineering personnel on the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways to engage in rush repairs, but it would be difficult to concentrate the existing equipment on each line to rush repair the damaged sections of the above-mentioned two lines. It is easier to concentrate personnel, but the required equipment cannot be obtained at will. Ling encouraged the employees to have the greatest confidence and cited the heroic deeds of Zhan Tianyou, the giant of Chinese road construction, as an encouragement. However, according to engineering personnel, everything unbelievable has been done to save Chinese railway transportation. "Digging flesh to heal sores" has already been seen in the dismantling of the Beijing-Wuhu Railway. It is even more difficult to count the number of "thousands of miles to send sleepers," transporting sleepers thousands of miles away. Even if the engineering personnel can overcome all difficulties, the troops along the railway line are delaying their actions, and the road repair project may not be completed in the short term.</p>

It is now expected that the Gu Ang government will be formed today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] French Interim President Gu Ang is encountering the same financial problems as former President de Gaulle. According to a report from a member attending the Socialist Party meeting, Gu Ang declared that France would not face the most severe economic crisis only if it relied on a US$2.5 billion loan from the United States. Before organizing the new cabinet, Gu Ang sought the approval of the three parties for his financial plan and asked the Socialist Party to abide by the plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Gu Ang stated that France's financial and food situation was extremely difficult. Unless the three parties accepted the plan, he would have no choice but to resign. However, he promised that once the three parties announced their cooperation, he would begin to organize a new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] It was announced this morning: The grand outline proposed by President Gu Ang to the three parties yesterday, if accepted by the three parties, would likely result in Philippe, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Socialist Party Congress, accepting the position of Finance Minister. President Gu Ang's outline stated that France's finances were on the verge of bankruptcy and that everyone must be prepared for major sacrifices and implement strict economies to save the crisis. Official news this morning stated that the Socialist Party and the Progressive Catholic Party had already accepted Gu Ang's outline. President Gu Ang asked the three parties to adopt strong policies to reduce government spending and criticized General de Gaulle for lacking the courage to tell people the truth about the economy and finance.</p>
<h3 id="e23">United Nations Military Staff Committee Will Be Convened in London Soon to Draft a Plan for Organizing an International Military Force <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] The Security Council resolved to convene the Military Staff Committee before February 1st to begin drafting agreements on the establishment of military forces for the United Nations organization. Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated that Soviet military representatives might not arrive on schedule or would request a postponement of two or three days. Since the Soviet representative openly opposed the Security Council's consideration of the Suez dispute, the meeting proceeded in a tense atmosphere. Finally, Vyshinsky and British Foreign Secretary Bevin mutually praised the achievements of the UK and the Soviet Union, and the atmosphere at the meeting improved.</p>
<p>Various Issues Awaiting Negotiation</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Senior military officers and their adjutants of the powers forming the United Nations Staff Committee have been appointed. Some are already on their way to London, while others are preparing to depart. The work they will undertake is "to provide the Security Council with advice and assistance on military needs related to the Security Council's maintenance of international peace and security, the use and command of its deployable forces, and the formulation of arms and possible disarmament regulations," and will be responsible for "the strategic guidance of any forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council." However, the various issues they must decide before they can fulfill these responsibilities are difficult to summarize. These senior military officers must decide whether to actually form an international military force, a plan that still has few supporters, or only form a "potential" military force, and only transfer designated teams from the military forces of various countries to form an international military force when necessary. Other issues, such as the number of troops that each country can obtain in the Pacific, Mediterranean, Atlantic, and other regions and their level of preparedness, the unwillingness of the governments of some countries to disclose their latest secret weapons for use by international military forces, and the use of international war means to effectively deal with any emergency situations, all need to be decided by them. As early as May last year, there was a plan to transfer teams from various countries and train them into an international military force. If any country has a slight intention to do so, the international military force can be sent to the vicinity of that country to conduct exercises, which is tantamount to an effective way of "advising the United Nations agency." Several countries, including Canada, are willing to use their vast plains for the training of United Nations agency forces. Decisions must be made on this matter and the allocation of its officers. Or the Military Staff Committee may find that its most difficult and most important work is still in political relations, such as the Atomic Energy Commission, and it must obtain guarantees from various countries that the international military force can be transferred immediately after notification, which is also an issue that must be resolved.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 26th] It is reported that the leaders of the five powers intend to prompt the London United Nations General Assembly to conclude within ten days, so that the headquarters can be moved to the United States as soon as possible. If this plan is realized, the Security Council will inevitably take some urgent political issues to the United States.</p>

After making the above decision at the 18th General Assembly, it began debating the method of electing officials of the United Nations agency.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Washington Democratic Congressman Cavanaugh today accused British policy in India, Siam, and Indonesia of sowing the seeds of World War III. The United States should also bear part of the responsibility in this regard, because it allowed Britain to use Lend-Lease materials and failed to intervene on behalf of the millions of conquered people in Asia. Cavanaugh continued, "India's struggle for freedom is of concern to the whole world. If Britain insists on not allowing 400 million people to stand up, the world that the United Nations is striving for cannot be established."</p>

<h3 id="e28">Powers Engaging in Cunning Rivalry to Contend for Advantageous Balance of Power; British Foreign Policy at a Crossroads <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] The Economic Review weekly "The Economist" recently criticized the Soviet Union's submission of the Indonesian and Greek issues after Iran complained about Soviet interference, stating that British foreign policy is clearly at a crossroads. The Soviet Union is now proceeding step by step, like playing chess, trying to force Britain to leave no piece behind. The Soviet accusations are only part of a larger struggle. The struggle of the powers in the world is in full swing, and they all want to strive for an "advantageous" balance of power, strategically secure spheres of influence, guarantees of important interests, and bases and regions for concessions. One of the key points of American diplomacy is that foreign powers must not interfere in the American hemisphere, but recently the United States seems to have extended the Monroe Doctrine to the Chinese coast. Elite American troops are now being used to interfere in China's civil war, and Truman has clearly stated that the United States will decide which islands in the Pacific are necessary for the security of the United States. The various actions of the United States have clearly shown its jealousy of the British presence in this region, such as the attitude of the United States towards Hong Kong and Burma, the favoritism towards American commerce in Shanghai, and MacArthur's uncooperative attitude towards British commerce in Japan. The Soviet Union is also taking similar policies on the edge of its power. For example, European governments must be "friendly" to it. On one hand, it is putting pressure on Turkey to allow it to control the straits, and on the other hand, it is starting to weaken or even eliminate British and American forces in Iran. It has become increasingly obvious that Britain has lost its freedom of action between the two extremes of the Soviet Union and the United States, and has repeatedly shown that it is an excellent echo of American diplomacy. At the Moscow Conference, the United States took the lead on the governments of the Balkan countries and the atomic bomb issue, and Britain followed. In everything, Britain must consult with Washington first. In the Soviet view, this has the undesirable implication of Britain and the United States forming a bloc. Therefore, the Soviet Union is now launching a counterattack against the weaker party. The Soviet Union will never submit the US intervention in China to the Security Council but has already joined the Far Eastern Commission which the US controls the power. It hits Britain instead of the US, and it hits Greece and Java instead of China. Therefore, the last reason to believe that the "British-American bloc" has been broken, because Britain sees less and less of what she obtains, no matter what support it gives to the US."</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Takano, leader of the Japanese Social Democratic Party, suggested in the "Yomiuri Hochi" yesterday that a national conference be held to formulate a constitution based on democratic principles. The constitution should stipulate the abolition of the imperial system, the establishment of a republic, and the president's term of office should be limited to four years, with the possibility of consecutive terms, but not more than two consecutive terms. According to Takano, Emperor Hirohito, as head of state and commander-in-chief of the army and navy, cannot escape responsibility for causing the war. Therefore, MacArthur's headquarters' crackdown on Japanese political movements cannot be pardoned.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tehran, 26th] After former Iranian Prime Minister Hamiki failed to negotiate with the Soviet Union and resigned to take responsibility, the Iranian Parliament today elected former Prime Minister Sandana as Prime Minister. Sandana had previously agreed to find ways to allow the Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan provincial government to hold direct negotiations and guaranteed that Moscow would listen to his opinions. The British and American sides felt that Sandana's appointment as Prime Minister of Iran at least gave the Soviet Union a temporary victory in the first dispute in the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p>Celebrations by Overseas Indians in Various Places</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] At the Indian Independence Day celebration held here by the Indian Freedom Committee, Indian writer Dr. Harindranath Chattopadhyaya gave a speech, saying that the Indian question would definitely be resolved by 1946. This year is India's crucial year, so it is not too early for us to celebrate India's Independence Day here. After the elections held in India around April, it will either take the road of constitutionalism or head towards revolution. For the sake of the world, India should achieve independence through a constitutional assembly, not through revolution. Therefore, the United Nations organization should monitor the United Kingdom to prevent it from using the pretext of India's internal disunity to prolong the convening of the constitutional assembly. The American India Alliance also issued a declaration on the same day, signed by soldiers and New York State legislator Sayler, stating that the struggle for Indian freedom should continue to be supported by the American people. We extend our respects to the Indian patriots, hoping that this year will be the last year of pre-celebrating Indian independence, and next year will be the first anniversary of Indian independence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] At the Independence Day banquet held last night by the Indian Congress Party Members Committee in London, British Labour Party Professor Juddlin delivered a speech, stating that if the United Kingdom adopts a forward-looking policy, it should recognize that the national movement will flourish in the Far East. For the sake of moral responsibility and political interests, the United Kingdom should adapt to this goal. The Soviet Union is now criticizing the British administration for adopting colonialism. In the eyes of British and American friends, this term is actually the same as imperialism. The necessity of saving civilians from chaos and continuing to implement civil administration is indeed something that everyone must understand, but I always feel that we have colluded with France and the Netherlands, and France and the Netherlands do not seem to have any contact with the far-sighted policies of the post-war world. I have great trust in the intentions of the British government, but the facts show that the United Kingdom is adopting a political system of maintaining the old system, which urgently needs to be reformed in the short term. I hope that the parliamentary delegation currently in India will bring back a report explaining a sound path to solving the problem.</p>

<p>The Yangtze River, also known as the Yangtze River, is the lifeline of Chinese transportation, the source of irrigation, and also the ruthless destroyer of life and wealth. It originates from the northeast of the west, three English miles above sea level.</p>
<p>This Yangtze River, which is 3,200 miles long, is one of the few long rivers in the world, flowing through the heart of China, passing through the Three Gorges upstream between Chongqing and Yichang, then crossing the densely populated basin, passing through Shanghai, and pouring into the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>China has a dream of utilizing this great river, to bring it under control at the eastern end of the Three Gorges, near Yichang, where the rushing river begins to flow slowly and disperse, in order to use its power.</p>
<p>With the help and encouragement of the United States, China has begun to plan the world's largest hydropower project there. The various projects of the U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Reclamation Bureau have controlled floods and irrigation, generated hydropower, and realized regional industrial and agricultural plans. China is formulating an unprecedented public works project based on its own ideals and American experience.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Development Will Benefit Hundreds of Millions of People</p>
<p>The Yichang Sluice Gate will be the largest solid sluice gate in the world. The hydropower it generates is five times greater than the existing world's largest Grand Coulee Sluice Gate. The sluice gate forms a 250-mile-long reservoir with a capacity of 50 million acre-feet, twice the size of the Boulder Sluice Gate.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water conservancy project has been abbreviated as "Yangyu'an" (TVA) in the same way as the American TVA. When it is built, sluice gates will be built on each tributary and the Yellow River. The Yellow River, because of its floods, has been known as "China's scourge." The Chinese government usually refers to Yangyu'an as the Savage Plan, because the preliminary report on this plan was made by John L. Savage, the designer of the Grand Coulee, Boulder, and Shasta Gates. Savage was famous as a design engineer of the U.S. Reclamation Bureau. In 1944, he stayed in China for a period at the invitation of the Chinese government and with the support of the State Department.</p>
<p>Difficult Project Digs Through Mountain Rocks and Bores Tunnels</p>
<p>The plan stipulates that mountain rocks will be excavated in Yichang, and tunnels will be dug to set up a power plant in the tunnels, generating 10 million kilowatts, which will be even greater than the sum of the power generation of the Grand Coulee, Boulder, and Shasta power plants.</p>
<p>Yangyu'an's permanent power generation, in addition to supplying the area within a 300-mile radius centered on the sluice gate site, can also connect Nanjing in the east, Chengdu in the west, Guiyang in the south, and Tianjin in the north through high-voltage power lines. Therefore, the number of people it affects will be greater than the entire population of the United States. Not only will the irrigation of the Yangtze River be improved, but also the river water will be raised all year round, and ocean-going ships can also sail to Chongqing, 650 miles from the coast. If hundreds of miles of canals are dug, millions of acres of land can be irrigated. Even if floods cannot be completely eliminated, they will not cause floods within 700,000 square miles of land.</p>
<p>Hydropower Utilization Will Be Greater Than That of the United States Before the War</p>
<p>Due to the continuous internal strife in China and the impact of years of war, all of the above is still just a hope. However, precisely because of China's extreme poverty, it is even more necessary to catch up. Hope exists in dramatic reforms. They can only begin to be realized after accelerating national industrialization, agricultural improvement, and faster transportation plans.</p>
<p>In order to realize this huge engineering plan in China, several steps have already begun. China currently has no hydropower generation equipment at all, but the hydropower it can use is much greater than that of the United States before the war. Its development is enough to accomplish infinite tasks in this region where human arms and legs are the main source of power.</p>
<p>In December 1945, the China Resources Commission allocated 250,000 yuan to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Reclamation Bureau to pay for the initial costs required for the Yangyu'an plan. This allocation was carried out according to the contract. The contract stipulates that the engineers of the Reclamation Bureau are responsible for formulating the plan for the canal network and the sluice gate. The planning work itself will require approximately 250,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Design Budget Conducted by Chinese and American Engineers</p>
<p>The Reclamation Bureau will devote itself to various engineering and economic studies required for the development of the great river itself and its five major tributaries, including the location of the sluice gate and power plant, as well as recommendations for maximizing the role of the river and the entire basin. The engineers of the Reclamation Bureau will be responsible for making various models, testing hydraulic models, preparing various design drawings, construction books, and cost budgets. Part of the work will be carried out by several Chinese engineers, geologists, and economists working under the guidance of American engineers in the Denver office of the Reclamation Bureau, paid by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The cost of the Yangyu'an project is entirely China's own business. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes has said that the contract only stipulates technical assistance and does not involve other matters. The completion of the work may take 10 to 25 years, and the estimated opening cost is between 100 million and 150 million U.S. dollars. According to the estimate made by Mr. Meng Changbing in an article published in the "Miller's Review," the time will take 10 years. The construction of sluice gates, docks, and hydropower plants will cost 133 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the construction of major factories near the Yangtze River sluice gate will cost 200 million U.S. dollars. Chinese economists say that if China can obtain Japan's silk trade, the United States can lend 140 million U.S. dollars, and China will repay the loan within 10 years. In this way, China's silk trade to the United States must be very prosperous and reach 1.4 million U.S. dollars each year.</p>
<p>Consolidating National Relations and Strengthening International Economic Security</p>
<p>Naturally, all of China's construction plans have encountered funding problems. The most important point is not whether there are difficulties, but that work has now begun. China may not be able to open up mountains and build roads as quickly as Americans, but things cannot be done by only asking when it will be completed and standing by and watching. Ickes said: Concerted efforts are another link in international understanding.</p>
<p>He also said: "The contract is another step in consolidating Sino-American relations. I am very proud that the Reclamation Bureau can undertake this difficult task. The engineers in the bureau are famous for developing water conservancy in the western states. They are often hired to cooperate with foreign governments to carry out the design and technical work of this development plan, thereby strengthening economic security. I think this is the most practical way to promote international understanding."</p>

<p>— Lecture by Zhu Jinjiang (Continued)</p>
<p>(5) The Peacock King Cave: In the center is a statue of great beauty seated upon a peacock. Above the cave entrance is an inscription in the style of Song Dynasty calligrapher Huang Shangu. At this time, Shangu had been deceased for over ninety years. The calligraphy has a craggy style, far superior to the likes of Cai Jing.</p>
<p>(6) The Arhat Cave: There is an inscription from the fourth year of the Xuanhe reign of the Song Dynasty. People often refer to the Eighteen Arhats, but there are actually Sixteen Arhats. The number of statues in this cave is extremely large, because they were not created all at once.</p>
<p>The Upper Ksitigarbha Cave: This cave was carved by Fu Yuanjun. There is also a statue of this kind in the records of the Western Regions by Stan, called *Qi You Di Po*, and not Ksitigarbha. The lines of this statue are bold and broad, like the large brush strokes in painting.</p>
<p>(8) The Avalokitesvara Infinite Life Sutra Transformation Cave: Inside is carved the story of King Ajatasatru of India imprisoning his father. Shakyamuni is preaching the Dharma. Outside the cave is a record of sixteen Avalokitesvara statues, built in the third year of the Qianning reign. To the right are three rows of donors. The top row of fourteen people all wear black gauze hats, the middle row of fourteen people all wear head wraps, and the bottom row of twelve are all female figures, all wearing kerchiefs. According to the record of the reconstruction, Chen Shaozhen and his wife, the Huang family, made a vow to Buddha during the disturbances of the fifth year of the Chunhua reign to paint this image. There is also a niche with a sutra pillar, on which is carved the Dharani Sutra. Another statue niche has been destroyed, but it is recorded as being from the third year of the Daguan reign of the Song Dynasty, and the characters are modeled after the "Slender Gold" style of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>(9) The Many Treasures Pagoda: Built by Song Dynasty scholar Feng. There is a Nirvana statue inside, but the Buddha is no longer there. On the door is carved "Engraved by Fu Xiaoba."</p>
<p>(B) Baodingshan: All the statues were built by Zhao Zhifeng alone in the Southern Song Dynasty, claiming to be Zhao Benzun, successor to Tang Dynasty's Liu Benzun. He began by building the Great Treasure Pavilion, and then created the statues. Among them is a giant Buddha statue, the upper half of which is more than six *zhang* long. In front of the Nirvana statue is a disciple, head tilted, with a field arch erected, who is the Dharma Protector Wei Xian. There is also a square pagoda, which is a place for storing scriptures. The artistic value of the statues in this Tantric Buddhist temple is not as good as that of Beishan, but the didactic intention is very strong.</p>
<p>The general view of statues is that the older they are, the more valuable they are. I do not agree with this view. In the early period of statue creation, they imitated human scale, and were mostly immature. When they reached maturity, their works had their own unique appearance. The mature period of statue art in our country was in the late Tang, Five Dynasties, and Northern Song Dynasties. The paintings of Daoxuan had a great influence. The Dazu Beishan is precisely the work of this period, so it is the most valuable. After the Northern Song Dynasty, it showed a trend of decline, and there were fewer stone carvings at this time, because this work was difficult, not as easy as casting bronze or sculpting clay. We are very pleased to have discovered four statues by the Fu family this time. Due to time constraints, I have only given a general account. As for the detailed historical background and artistic criticism of the statues, I will discuss them in the future. (End)</p>

<p>General Spaatz, who succeeds General Arnold as Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces, is one of the pioneers of the American aviation community. This is what President Truman said.</p>
<p>General Spaatz has successively served as commander of the strategic bomber fleets in Europe and the Pacific. Last week, with the approval of the authorities, he was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant general.</p>
<p>Since World War I, General Spaatz has been an outstanding theoretician of aerial tactics. In early 1945, the number of aircraft and aviators he commanded was unparalleled in history.</p>
<p>Looking back at World War I, Spaatz had already served as the commander of a U.S. Army pilot training station. Due to his outstanding performance, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and broke the record for shooting down three enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>In the following decade, Spaatz served as the commander of various airfields in the United States. In 1929, he and General Eaker flew an Army aircraft together, performing non-stop refueling flights, staying in the air for six days. In 1940, General Spaatz went to England as an observer. In 1943, when General Eisenhower organized the Air Force ground task force in North Africa, Spaatz was one of the first officers to be called up. In 1944, Spaatz established the renowned accurate bombing force in the British Isles, relentlessly bombing France and Germany day and night. Spaatz served as the commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe until he was awarded the rank of general in March 1945.</p>
<p>General Spaatz is fifty-four years old this year and has three daughters. (Translated by U.S. News)</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Communist Party's Benevolent Governance in Yantai <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a small businessman from Yantai who has been oppressed by the enemy and puppets for eight years and detained by the Communist Party for a month. I have no party affiliation and am not a member of the bourgeoisie. During the Anti-Japanese War, I sympathized with the Communist Party in eastern Shandong. But since the Communist Party took control of Yantai, I have deeply realized its true face! It loudly proclaims democracy, but in reality, it is more autocratic than the emperors of old. This article is entirely factual. I recently traveled for half a month from the Communist Party's bases in Yanshan, Haiyang, Pingdu, and Yexian, to Qingdao, and then via Lianyungang and Xuzhou, to Shanghai. What I saw and heard is only one-tenth of what I could write. Because upon arriving in Shanghai, I realized that people in the Jiangnan region sympathize with the Communist Party because they are indignant at the corruption of unscrupulous officials. They have not tasted the Communist Party's flavor, so it is no wonder. I sincerely hope that you will publish this article so that people from eastern Shandong who are living in Shanghai can learn about the situation in their hometown, and so that people in Jiangnan, especially in Shanghai, can understand the Communist Party's benevolent governance.</p>
<p>Respectfully, a Yantai refugee. January 17.</p>
<p>Since the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Communist forces in eastern Shandong began to attack and seize territory, capturing Muping on August 16, Fushan on August 17, and Penglai on August 19. Bai Shu, the puppet magistrate of Dengzhou and mayor of Yantai, received Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's order to "defend the original positions and maintain public order." He gathered the police forces of various counties and the guerrilla units of Sun Zhenxian, Wang Zhishan, and Kuang Yuzhou, totaling over ten thousand men, to defend Yantai, with ample arms and provisions. The Communist forces, with two regiments and over ten thousand militia, began to attack Yantai on August 20. The rebel Bai initially led the troops to resist, but on August 23, the Japanese troops withdrew on orders and boarded ships, and on August 24, while the rebel Bai was in the midst of fierce fighting on the front lines, he took his concubine Zhu Juanhong and fled by speedboat, causing the entire army to collapse. Only Sun Zhenxian's unit of over a thousand men broke through and crossed the Communist-controlled area to Rushankou, boarded civilian ships, and reached Qingdao. The rest were captured. Since occupying Yantai, the Communist forces have burned, killed, captured, and plundered without restraint. The people, who had been ravaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years, have had their blood and marrow drained. Now they have suffered the poison of the Communist forces. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and it will probably take decades to restore the situation to its original state. The "benevolent governance" of the Communist forces is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Looting of Resources</p>
<p>The Communist forces began looting on the second day of entering Yantai. The public and private property of hundreds of Japanese, German, and Italian residents, including the Japanese companies Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Iwaki, and Sanyu, and the German companies Ansi, Wanfeng, Dechun, Defu, and Chen, was confiscated. In addition, 20,000 boxes of kerosene and several thousand boxes of gasoline from the American company Mobil Asia, all the medical equipment and furniture of the Huangding American Hospital, and the machinery and materials of the British companies Jardine Matheson and Wing On were all looted. When the Pacific War broke out and the Allied countries evacuated their citizens, all the materials were listed and handed over to the Japanese consul by the respective consuls. The Japanese invaders sealed up all the property of Allied private businesses, but the Communist forces brazenly looted it, using over a thousand mules and horses and over two thousand large and small vehicles every day for more than a month to transport everything away. Over one billion yuan in puppet currency stored in the Central Bank and other banks was also looted. Over fifty of the larger factories and shops in Yantai, such as Ruifeng Flour Mill, Yongkang, Bingfu, the mining factory, Zhangyu Winery, and Liquan Distillery, were confiscated on the grounds of collaborating with the enemy. Over a hundred wealthy households had their doors smashed open in the middle of the night by militiamen, who looted everything inside. Thousands of radio sets belonging to merchants and civilians were ordered to be handed over, and those who did not comply were labeled as counter-revolutionaries. In addition, over 20,000 bolts of white fine cloth stored in the city were forcibly purchased at a price of 1,200 yuan per bolt (in resistance currency).</p>
<p>(2) Killing and Arson</p>
<p>The China Inland Mission, located on the Yantai seashore, covered more than 30 *mu* of land and had over 600 exquisite buildings. The Alice Memorial Hospital, built on the western slope of Mount Dongshan, was set ablaze by the Communist Party with landmines and kerosene at 9 p.m. on September 26, burning for a full day and night. When Americans came to Yantai to question the incident, it was blamed on Kuomintang agents, and a death row inmate was taken from prison, shot, and presented as the culprit. Since the Communist forces arrived in Yantai, the number of people killed under the pretext of mass rallies includes Shao Zimin, Guo Shanggu, Jin Xinzhi, Yu Hongru, Qian Leqi, Wang Jin, Chang Pinghou, Qi Yuanzhen, Liu Guobin, Qi Shikun, and over twenty others. Those assassinated on suspicion of Kuomintang affiliation are even more difficult to count. The most tragic case involved two students from the Municipal No. 2 Middle School, Gao and Xu (names unknown), who made remarks critical of the Communist Party in the lecture hall. The next day, their bodies were found in the ditch on the southern slope of Yuhuangding, with over a dozen wounds and blood and flesh everywhere, a truly horrifying sight.</p>
<p>(3) Indiscriminate Arrests of People</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Public Security Bureau has a "suppress traitors" section. In recent months, over ten thousand people have been arrested, including gentry, civil servants, teachers, neighborhood chiefs, intellectuals, the wealthy, and the ruling class. None have been spared. Local thugs formed the People's Inspection Team, workers and rickshaw pullers formed the Workers' Armed Brigade, and farmers and vendors formed the People's Armed Forces, all with the power to arrest people. These people would get whatever they wanted from the arrested, before release, otherwise, the arrested would be sent to the Public Security Bureau. In October, due to rumors of an American landing, the Public Security Bureau's "suppress traitors" section was established at the Huangjia and Wangqiaozhuang villages in the mountains of Muping, and over a hundred prisoners were held there. The detention rooms were set up in the ancestral halls of the villagers, with straw spread on the ground. Dozens of people were gathered in one room, and two guards with guns stood at the door. They had to get up at 6 a.m., sit cross-legged and motionless, and were not allowed to move. Smoking, talking, and dozing were all prohibited. They had to go to bed at 8 p.m., and even turning over or scratching required permission, or they would be beaten with gun butts. Zhu Ziyu, the manager of Guanghua Pond, was hung from the beam for a day and a night for talking in his sleep. Ninety percent of those detained suffered from skin diseases. Because there were too many detainees, it took half a month to get a hearing. During the interrogation, there was no clear objective. They enticed people to be loyal and honest, promising never to let the wrong person go, so even innocent good people had to be detained for more than a month before being sent to Yanshan County for two months of training before being released. Cui Baosheng, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce eight years ago, and the current directors of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Runsheng, Lin Qiupu, Gao Hanqian, Liu Pengfei, Wang Yisan, and Shao Wu, and over twenty others were all sent to the Jiaodong Military Region and sentenced to three to ten years of imprisonment. Personnel from customs and transportation agencies were detained in Laiyang. The author was detained for over a month for exchanging northern currency (i.e., resistance currency, which they fixed at 80 yuan of northern currency for one yuan of prepared currency, when it was actually only worth 10 yuan). I personally experienced it, and the atmosphere in prison was no less unpleasant than a nightmare. I wrote several limericks, one of which is recorded here: "Knocking on shins to move, knocking on heads to sleep, sitting cross-legged like a prisoner all day long. Except for facing the sun and touching the top of my head, there is nothing else I am free to do!"</p>
<p>(4) Cruel Struggle Sessions</p>
<p>The Communist Party claims that what it is practicing is "New Democracy," which is separate from communism, and communism still requires a layer of socialism, so it will not engage in communism now. But in reality, it uses struggle sessions instead of communism. Anyone with even a small amount of assets must be "struggled against." Every time a struggle session is held, people from one or dozens of villages are gathered at the venue, and the "struggled against" person is forced to stand on a high table and confess his own or his ancestors' crimes. Even if there are no facts, he must fabricate them at will according to their wishes. Their party members are scattered in every corner, urging the people to attack and insult him. If the "struggled against" person does not comply with their demands, he will be lightly doused with feces and urine, called drinking "repentance soup," or stripped naked and whipped with thorny branches, called "itching." In severe cases, his feet will be tied with hemp rope and dragged through the streets by the villagers, called "pulling the foreign plow." As a result, in addition to the loss of their family property, nine out of ten of those "struggled against" have been humiliated to death. In Yantai, over a hundred businesses have been "struggled against." Wang Mengchen, chairman of the brick and tile guild, Sun Naipu, the village chief of Zhifutun, and Shi Jun, an employee of the vegetable market, were all beaten to a pulp in the struggle sessions. Wang Cha's sister (a hospital nurse) in the Municipal Hospital, because her brother had fled, was dragged to the sports field by the Communist Party for a struggle session. They insisted that she had given birth to an illegitimate child and that she had to take off her underwear for proof. She died of shame and indignation that night. In Xujiadian District of Yanshan, there was an old virgin named Lin, whose parents, brothers, and sisters-in-law had all died. She took care of her young nephew for a living, but the village cadres also held a struggle session against her. Her uncle, over forty years old, stood up to protect her and was stripped naked by the Communist Party and made to kneel on the Eight Immortals table. His niece was stripped down to her underpants and made to stand beside him. The old man died of anger in a few days. The most tragic case was in a village two *li* away from Xujiadian (village name forgotten), where Zhang Degong was dragged to death in a struggle session. His two sons cried and cursed in grief and were buried alive on the spot. Alas! I wonder what Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and the other gentlemen would think if they heard of such things?</p>
<p>(5) Destruction of Decency</p>
<p>In order to win over high-spirited soldiers, the Communist Party selected women with attractive looks from various counties to form "Women's National Salvation Corps." Every time they attacked a stronghold and won, the corps would comfort the soldiers. From top to bottom, they would take turns satisfying their desires. The women's salvation association of Xujiadian Village was particularly well-known. As the author passed through there, he heard them singing, "The women's salvation association is really backward, going back to their mothers' homes, riding livestock. Oh yeah, don't say ashamed, but not ashamed?" At a meeting in April, two members gave birth on the spot. Hu, the head of the "suppress traitors" section in Yantai, and Ma, a staff member, each had two beautiful female party members as subordinates, who took turns accompanying them to sleep every night, causing scandalous rumors to spread everywhere. Yantai is now divided into six districts and fifty-eight villages. Each village has a women's national salvation association, and all women between the ages of fourteen and fifty must participate. They stand guard during the day and hold meetings at night. Those with even a little bit of attractiveness are often kept by the guidance association until midnight before being allowed to return home. Husbands cannot control their wives, and fathers cannot control their daughters. If they say anything against it, they will be accused of being counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>(6) Slandering Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The Communist Party representatives verbally recognized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership position at the Consultative Conference, but their subordinates insulted the Chairman every time they held a meeting. The various insults are too unbearable to describe in detail. The people were all filled with anger. Men in Yantai between the ages of fifteen and fifty were all organized into self-defense corps and stretcher teams, gathering from time to time and training every day. The strong young men of other counties were drafted into the militia and driven to the front lines. Those who deserted along the way would be put to death if caught. When reading Mr. Huang Yanpei's "One Trip to Yan'an," he claimed that the Communist Party's militia were all volunteers, truly deceiving gentlemen with rhetoric. Currently, the people in the region are prohibited from leaving the area. Even to travel from one village to another, even if only one *li* away, requires a pass. To go to the central area requires a pass from the municipal government, the Public Security Bureau, or a regimental headquarters or higher, otherwise, it is impossible to move an inch. Currently, over six hundred people who have fled the area are being detained in Lingshan, Laiyang. The density of the law and the cruelty of the methods are even worse than those of the Japanese invaders. The people of eastern Shandong are longing for the arrival of the Central Army as if they were hoping for rain in a great drought. But they have been waiting for months, and there is no sign of them. Alas! (A Yantai Refugee)</p>

<h3 id="e52">An Impartial Discussion on the Labor Strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Recently, labor strikes have occurred frequently in Shanghai, with the recent labor strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company being the most serious and complex, attracting great concern from the community. Indeed, as the nation celebrates victory, production urgently needs to be revived. Labor-management cooperation and catching up are of utmost importance, and we cannot afford any delays due to labor strikes. In particular, electricity is the source of power for all industries and the most important of municipal public utilities. Fortunately, the workers deeply understand the greater good and have declared that they will not allow any interruption in the electricity supply; otherwise, the impact on production would be unimaginable. However, even with the stalemate of the past few days, the Electric Power Company's labor strike has become a focus of public discussion. If the workers' intention is solely economic, they should, in addition to their own demands, observe how the general public feels about their recent actions. Standing in the position of journalists, having inquired widely, and summarizing reports from various sources, we would like to offer some impartial opinions on the recent labor strike, hoping that the government authorities and both labor and management will consider them.</p>
<p>Since the victory, the labor strikes that have occurred one after another have been caused by either unemployed workers requesting to return to work or calling for relief, or by employed workers demanding increased wages and improved treatment. In all fairness, under the circumstances of rising prices and difficult living conditions, workers who rely on wages to make a living find it difficult to cope with the seven necessities of daily life. Once unemployed or idle for a period of time, they gradually find themselves unable to sustain themselves. It is only human to unite and call for help. Those workers who still have jobs also demand improved treatment because the wages they receive each month do not correspond to the rise in the cost of living, or are even far apart. They are driven by the pressure of high prices, which is also understandable. Therefore, generally speaking, workers at this time, whether unemployed asking for jobs or employed asking for wage increases, are met with sympathy in public opinion. If management ignores this, refuses to listen, or even uses high-handed tactics, it is not a wise strategy.</p>
<p>However, sympathizing with workers' demands is one thing, and whether workers should resort to strikes at every turn is another. Those engaged in the labor movement, as well as the leaders of labor unions, should deeply understand this point and should not think that since workers can demand certain rights, they can use strikes at any time to achieve their goals. A slight carelessness in the indiscriminate use of the weapon (referring to strikes) may turn previous sympathizers into detractors. We are not saying that workers can never strike. We do recognize that in a democratic country, workers have the right to strike when necessary. However, fellow workers should note that a country should always have laws, and democratic countries in particular should value laws. The labor movement should naturally be brought within the legal framework. How to handle labor-management disputes is stipulated by national laws, and the government has also issued clear announcements. First, labor and management should negotiate on their own. If negotiations fail, they can apply to the government's competent authority for mediation according to the law. If mediation fails, they can even petition the superior competent authority to conduct arbitration, and legal representatives will participate in the arbitration, so there is no need to worry about bias. If a strike is absolutely necessary, it can only be used as a last resort after all legal avenues of mediation and arbitration have been exhausted, management is stubborn, and intentionally oppresses the workers, or even refuses to accept the arbitration award. Only when the labor side has exhausted all legal channels and is left with no other option can it reluctantly use this final weapon, using strikes as a means to protect its reasonable demands. If this is the case, then even if the strike is an unfortunate term, it can still be understood by the public, or even supported with sympathy. On the contrary, if they only rely on the power of the masses and use strikes and slowdowns as the only method, completely disregarding legal procedures, or even refusing to attend when the competent authorities come forward to mediate, and ignoring repeated notices, or even demanding that management send representatives to the workers' ranks to negotiate, as the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company have done recently, we feel that it is somewhat excessive in terms of law and reason, and we really feel sorry for them. As for the content of their demands, that is another matter. Even if all their demands are reasonable, this kind of practice and this kind of attitude are certainly not what the public wants to hear.</p>
<p>Taking the labor strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company as an example, it has been said that it has been intermittent since September of last year, and the Social Bureau has mediated more than once. According to documents distributed by the labor side, agreements have been reached, while the management has declared to the government that it is willing to accept the wage table decided by the authorities. In theory, there should not be much dispute, so why did the sudden slowdown occur again four days ago? According to the Public Utilities Bureau, the company's minimum wage is adjusted monthly according to the workers' cost of living index, which has increased more than ten times since the enemy surrendered, and is said to be better than that of general public school teachers. Therefore, there should not be a big problem with the wage increase. As for the dismissal of employees, they may be temporary employees or those who have committed errors, and it should be possible to resolve the matter fairly. The outstanding issues that the labor side considers unresolved are the issues of equal pay for equal work and wartime compensation. We don't know where these wartime compensation titles come from. If it is said to be compensation, every Chinese person except for traitors needs compensation, but how can compensation only be implemented by the management? It is said that the demands are often tens of thousands of yuan per person. Just imagine for the factory, how can it bear this burden? If all industries follow suit, then we dare say that not only will the Shanghai factories that have been shut down be unable to reopen, but those that have already resumed work will also feel unsustainable. As a result, industrialists will be reluctant to move forward, and who will be willing to invest in production businesses again? Those who are short-sighted think that this is fighting for the rights of workers, but in fact, it is tantamount to cutting off the workers' livelihood! As for equal pay for equal work for Chinese and foreign employees, it is originally reasonable, and we naturally hope that the government and the management will do their best to work towards this goal. However, the environment in Shanghai is special, and the work skills in various departments may not be completely consistent. Therefore, past practices need to be adjusted gradually if they are to be changed. How can they be achieved overnight? This kind of accumulated habit is not impossible to break, and it should also be promoted to be broken, but this matter can be decided by the government, or the two sides can discuss it calmly. Moreover, there is plenty of room for progress in the procedures of mediation and arbitration. Why should the workers use methods such as slowdowns and strikes to stalemate, seeking a solution overnight? Therefore, for the sake of the workers and for the sake of society, union leaders should accept the government's mediation in accordance with the law at this time, or even petition the government to seek justice. It is absolutely not advisable to delay without reason.</p>
<p>Moreover, slowdowns and strikes are indeed the rights of workers, but slowdowns and strikes should also be voluntary. Slowdowns and strikes may be permitted by law, but slowdowns and strikes by employees of public utilities are prohibited by law. Because public utilities are essential to the lives of all citizens, if they can be slowed down or struck at will, it will inevitably affect all citizens. As for some people in the labor union using team inspections to prohibit workers from entering and leaving in order to forcibly maintain their slowdown orders, it not only shows that this kind of slowdown is not the original intention of all workers (otherwise, why would they need to be prohibited from entering and leaving?), but also deprives the freedom of ordinary workers, and the individual freedom of will that is most valued in democratic politics is even thrown to the winds! In short, we sympathize with some of the reasonable demands of the employees of the Electric Power Company, and hope that the management will be accommodating, and especially hope that the government will mediate according to the law. But at the same time, we believe that the employees' refusal to mediate and forced slowdowns are not the style that workers in a democratic country should have, nor are they the attitude that those who abide by national laws and respect individual freedom should have. The proper resolution of the labor strike cannot be achieved by such means. The Electric Power labor strike is like this, and other labor strikes are also like this.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Electric Power Labor Strike at a Stalemate: Authorities Determined to Handle it Legally; Responsible Officials Report on the Mediation Process; Mayor Qian Hosts Press Conference Last Night <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(This Newspaper's Report) In recent days, labor strikes have been erupting one after another in this city, causing "a storm of unrest." Although enlightened individuals from all walks of life feel considerable sympathy for the workers' demands to a certain extent, they express great concern about the current trends, dynamics, and actions of the labor side. Last night, Mayor Qian Dajun hosted a press conference for leading figures in the media, frankly explaining to the reporters the overall situation of the recent labor strikes.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian specially introduced several officials who were actually responsible for handling labor disputes to report on the situation of labor strikes in the city. The reports were given by Wang Xianqing, a member of the Municipal Party Committee; Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau; and Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Shen Han's Dismissal Resulted from Electricity Theft</p>
<p>The most deteriorating labor strike situation at present is the work slowdown movement at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Since it began, it has been going on for four days as of yesterday. According to reports at the reception last night, the background of the labor strike is quite complicated. According to Mr. Wang Xianqing, the "immediate cause" of the work slowdown was the dismissal of Shen Han, a member of the labor union's executive committee, by the Electric Power Company. The reason for the dismissal was that the worker stole electricity by virtue of his position as a company employee. The Public Utilities Bureau, taking a neutral and impartial stance, conducted a thorough investigation of the case, and the result was that Shen Han was indeed suspected of stealing electricity. In addition, the second "main cause" of the work slowdown was that the Electric Power Company laid off several temporary workers due to a temporary lack of work.</p>
<p>Labor's Demands Reach More Than a Dozen Items</p>
<p>After receiving the news of the work slowdown, Mr. Wang Xianqing went to the Yangshupu Power Plant to negotiate with the labor union leaders in order to seek a swift and fair resolution. The labor side put forward more than ten demands, among which the following are noteworthy: (1) Management must obtain the labor union's consent for the appointment and removal of employees; (2) The company must immediately "dismiss" the fourteen senior executives listed on the labor side's "blacklist." The labor side said that these fourteen people were "stubborn elements who deliberately provoked animosity between labor and management"; (3) Open up company administration; (4) Overturn all "unreasonable" salary increases this year; (5) Allocate "wartime compensation money" of 400,000 yuan per person. (The total number of workers at the Electric Power Company is more than two thousand.)</p>
<p>Public Utilities Must Not Slow Down Work</p>
<p>When discussing the matter with the labor union representatives at Yangshupu, Mr. Wang Xianqing indicated that some of the demands seemed to be exceeding the scope of what was reasonable. In any case, all the demands had to be discussed at length. Moreover, the government has repeatedly announced that employees of public utilities must not slow down or strike. Therefore, Mr. Wang immediately advised the workers to resume work first and guaranteed that if the fact that the dismissed employee Shen Han stole electricity was not true, then the company would restore his job. Mr. Wang did not get any results from his talks with the labor union representatives, so he urged all the more than two thousand workers to resume work. According to Mr. Wang's report last night, the initial situation was very good, but it was stirred up again by a small number of people, resulting in an extremely tense situation.</p>
<p>Closing the Factory Gate, the Momentum is Fierce</p>
<p>Instigated by a small number of workers, more than two thousand workers rose up and demanded that company representatives come to the factory to negotiate with the workers. At that time, they also coerced Mr. Wang into using the telephone to notify management representatives to come to the factory to negotiate, which Mr. Wang refused. The workers then "locked" the power plant gate, declaring: "If the labor strike is not resolved in one day, everyone will not leave!" Mr. Wang was "guarded" by the workers for several hours, until he was released in the evening after being persuaded by more moderate workers. Last night at the reception, Mr. Wang reported on the mediation process. Everyone in attendance felt that in this atmosphere of democracy and the rule of law, it was extremely regrettable that the workers of the Electric Power Company disregarded "physical freedom," the most important condition of democracy, and detained Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>Company's Treatment is Relatively Good</p>
<p>Before Mr. Wang reported on the mediation process, Zhao Zengjue explained the treatment of workers at the Electric Power Company. The figures published by Mr. Zhao made everyone at the reception feel that the treatment at the Electric Power Company seemed better than the general situation before. Mr. Zhao reported that the minimum worker treatment at the Electric Power Company was:</p>
<p>August: 450,000 yuan in puppet currency (equivalent to 2,250 yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>September: 7,800 yuan in national currency (3.5 times more than August).</p>
<p>October: 12,000 yuan in national currency (more than 5 times more than August).</p>
<p>November: 32,000 yuan in national currency (14 times more than August).</p>
<p>December: 30,000 yuan (13.4 times more than August).</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhao, the adjustment of wages at the Electric Power Company is based on the cost of living index, and the adjustment measures are very fast. He said:</p>
<p>August cost of living index: 332,</p>
<p>September cost of living index: 922,</p>
<p>October cost of living index: 441,</p>
<p>November cost of living index: 1021,</p>
<p>December cost of living index: 945,</p>
<p>Director Zhao also pointed out that the minimum salary at the Electric Power Company before the war was 26 yuan. Based on this figure, the salary in December should be 24,000 yuan using the cost of living index, but the actual salary is currently 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Demands Have a Significant Impact</p>
<p>Director Zhao also stated that the American businessmen responsible for the Electric Power Company have generally been able to comply with the guidance of our municipal government, and they have also been able to follow the municipal government's regulations regarding the mediation of wage issues. The current situation of the workers' work slowdown and the demands they have made have indirectly caused foreigners to be quite hesitant about investing in our country. At the same time, it will also make the Chinese people hesitant to start resuming operations at closed factories.</p>
<p>Authorities Hope for Legality and Reasonableness</p>
<p>Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the number of labor disputes in recent months. He also explained that the government adopts the approach of protecting the rights and interests of workers and handling labor-management issues impartially in accordance with laws and regulations. Unreasonable attitudes and demands from workers or management must also be corrected from an impartial standpoint. Mr. Li also said that during the enemy-puppet era, military police used violence to suppress labor strikes, while today's government's approach is democratic, using mediation and arbitration to seek solutions. He hopes that the labor side can deeply understand this point and be mindful of the spirit of the rule of law in all aspects of its actions and not exceed the democratic approach.</p>
<p>Infringement of Freedom is Not in Line with Democracy</p>
<p>Lu Jingshi of the People's News reported that a worker at the Electric Power Company reported to him that all the workers were being "detained" in the factory by a small number of ringleaders and were not allowed to enter or leave. Many people had not had food or water for several days. Mr. Lu pointed out that this approach infringes on freedom of movement and is not in line with the most important conditions of democracy. He also said that the government's position is to handle all disputes impartially and to take into account the development of national industry so that the labor movement does not harm our country's urgently needed industrialization progress.</p>
<p>Effective Measures Taken Only as a Last Resort</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Qian solemnly stated that the government will still seek a solution to the labor strike at the Electric Power Company through peaceful, reasonable, and legal means. However, if a swift solution cannot be achieved under these circumstances, then since the municipal government has an order prohibiting public utility workers from slowing down or striking in the first place, the municipal government will take decisive and effective measures.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Foreign Newspapers Record Labor Strikes in Various Industries, Alleging Manipulation by Communist Elements; Demonstrations and Marches Show Underlying Motives <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* published on the 26th states: The labor strikes in this city, involving 20,000 workers, are not simply a matter of increased living expenses, but a more serious problem than this. *The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* has confirmed this after inquiring with various parties. Many parties believe that every labor strike is being manipulated by radical elements. It is claimed that at the workers' congress held in Yangshupu, banners of Lenin and red flags were displayed.</p>
<p>Nationalist Party workers here are adhering to instructions from Chongqing and taking a defensive stance in labor-management disputes, but radical elements (including red and pink elements) are taking an offensive stance by taking advantage of the consultation meetings.</p>
<p>Investigation results show that these demonstrations are being orchestrated by the Communist Party behind the scenes. In the first few marches, demonstrators raised slogans demanding that American troops return home, which is further proof that the demonstrations have a political background.</p>
<p>Most Labor Strikes in Various Industries Resolved</p>
<p>The turbulent and surging wave of strikes in this city has now been resolved item by item. The No. 17 Mill of the China Textile Corporation, the Commercial Press, and the barber industry resumed work yesterday. The labor unrest at the Ewo Cotton Mill was also resolved at 9 p.m. the night before, when representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for negotiations at the Bureau. It was decided that each person would be paid a severance payment of 16,000 yuan and the employment relationship would be terminated. This is because most of the factory's machinery was moved away by the Japanese, resulting in huge losses, and it is temporarily impossible to resume work. The severance payment will begin to be distributed next Monday and must be paid in full within two weeks. Those who do not collect it within the deadline will be deemed to have voluntarily given it up. Both sides were satisfied, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Mediation of Electric Power Labor Strike Unsuccessful</p>
<p>The labor unrest at the Electric Power Company is still at a stalemate. More than 2,800 employees are still gathered at the main factory. More than a hundred people have fallen ill. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for mediation. The labor side refused to go to the Social Affairs Bureau for talks because it had been decided at the workers' congress that the company's senior executive, Mr. Fress, must come to the main factory to negotiate, and the representatives had no power to overturn the congress's decision. In the afternoon, representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Committee, together with representatives from the five major public utilities, went to the Yangshupu Electric Power Company's main factory to persuade all the employees, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Yizhong Company Engages in Labor-Management Consultation</p>
<p>Since the Allied forces took over the Yizhong Tobacco Company, a part of it has now resumed work. Before the Pacific War, the factory deducted 5% of the salaries of the company's employees each month as savings. Now the factory's workers are demanding that the factory pay the savings in one lump sum, but there has been no work slowdown or strike. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, management has accepted the principle in principle, but the multiplier for the return of the savings has not been determined. The method of increasing the multiplier is still under study, but the factory will pay each person 10,000 yuan before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Labor Strike at Department Stores Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>The work slowdowns at the nine major department stores, Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lai Wah, Chung Hwa, Yue Shin, Great China, and Hwa Dah, were mediated by Section Chief Zhang of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon. More than 30 representatives from both sides attended. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely harmonious. Finally, the labor side expressed its sincerity in accepting mediation and was willing to reduce the requested salary of 35,000 yuan for employees by 500 yuan to 34,500 yuan. Meals would still be provided by the company. Management indicated that it could pay a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan according to the cost of living index, including meals, as assessed by the Wage Assessment Council, and then pay salaries monthly according to the index assessed by the Council. At 9 p.m. deep into the night, the conditions of both sides were still not close. Management representatives also stated that the labor side's conditions were too far apart and that they needed to consult with the company authorities to make a decision. Section Chief Zhang then scheduled a meeting for both parties to continue mediation at the Bureau at 10 a.m. this morning, striving to completely resolve the matter within today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e55">All Sectors Welcome and Bid Farewell to the National Army <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The New Sixth Army of the Army has been transferred to the Northeast, and the defense of this city will be taken over by the 207th Division of the Youth Army. All sectors of the city held an unprecedented grand meeting to welcome and bid farewell to the troops at the Great Light Theatre at 9 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Wu Shaoshu, He Dekui, Li Jilan, Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, and officers and soldiers from the New Sixth Army and the Youth Army, totaling more than 2,000 people. The meeting was chaired by Wu Shaoshu. Representatives of the meeting presented the New Sixth Army Commander Liao with a large red banner with the words "Pillars of the Party and the Nation" and presented Youth Army Commander Luo with a bouquet of flowers. Commanders Liao and Luo then delivered speeches in succession.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Municipal Land Administration Bureau Establishes Land Price Assessment Committee <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In order to assess land prices in the city, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau has established the Shanghai Standard Land Price Assessment Committee in accordance with central government regulations. Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Sun Chaoqian, Zhou Xuezhou, Zhou Feicheng, Li Shuxiong, Wan Bailin, and Song Wende were hired as members. The first meeting was held yesterday, during which the land price estimates for each district in the city were discussed in detail. In order to meet the current needs of land registration, a temporary standard for land and fixture valuations in the city was assessed to provide a basis for owners to declare land prices. Precise standard land prices will be investigated and registered by the Land Administration Bureau in segments and then submitted to the meeting for assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Wang Xiaolai Expresses Six Wishes at Sixty: All Sectors Publicly Celebrate Yesterday <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(This Newspaper's Report) Although it was raining lightly, the front of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instead busy with traffic yesterday, as everyone was there to publicly celebrate Wang Xiaolai's 60th birthday and 40th anniversary of his arrival in Shanghai. As soon as you entered the gate, a receptionist immediately asked you to sign your name.</p>
<p>Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness</p>
<p>You were then handed a red special edition, and you walked into the auditorium, sat down, and flipped through it carefully while drinking tea. The congratulatory poems and essays on it can be described as pearls of wisdom. The beginning is the four characters "述我六十" (Narrating My Sixtieth) handwritten by Mr. Wang himself, followed by his writing: "以忠恕心、行仁義事" (Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness). The six wishes for the future: "做未做之事，發未發之言，讀未讀之書，遊未遊之地，償未償之願，了未了之債" (To do what has not been done, to say what has not been said, to read what has not been read, to travel to where has not been travelled, to fulfill what has not been fulfilled, to settle what has not been settled). Before you could read any further, the Boy Scouts were already playing music, and the stage was filled with people waiting. The presidium and the birthday honoree took the stage one after another, performed the rituals, and then Liu Hongsheng, Li Shizeng, Yang Xiaotian, and more than a dozen others delivered congratulatory speeches in succession, all emphasizing Mr. Wang's importance to the country and society and wishing him eternal health.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai is Giving a Thank You Speech</p>
<p>Ten Sons in the Military, Grandchildren Giving Thanks</p>
<p>Later, the master of ceremonies asked the birthday honoree to report on his experience in Shanghai. Mr. Wang slowly walked to the front of the stage. His plump body was the same as before, and his loud voice was also the same as in the past. He began by saying that he did not want to report anything. At this moment, he had nothing else to say except to thank the organizers and the guests for their support. Then, in a wonderful scene, he ordered his children and grandchildren to stand in a row in front of the stage and bow to the guests to express their gratitude. There were four sons, five daughters, two grandsons, and one great-grandson. He said that this was only one-quarter. When they all returned in the future, he would also ask them all to kowtow and thank them. (Mr. Wang has ten sons who have joined the military to serve the country.) "以忠恕心，行仁義事" (Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness), I would like to borrow Mr. Wang's words to encourage everyone and jointly urge Mr. Wang to move towards a brighter and more admired path.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] Schegol, the Shanghai representative of the European Refugee Joint Distribution Committee during the Pacific War, recently returned to New York after residing in Shanghai for four years. He stated that there were a total of 15,000 European refugees in Shanghai under Japanese occupation, including 14,000 Jews, 600 Christians, and 400 Catholics, who were supported by a monthly donation of $100,000 from the New York Joint Committee headquarters to maintain their livelihoods. This relief fund was approved by the US government and remitted to Shanghai through neutral countries. Sending US dollars to Japanese-occupied areas was generally prohibited, but this was an exception. He pointed out that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's assistance to refugees in Shanghai after the war was of great value. Finally, he said, "Relying solely on relief is not enough. Now is the time to engage in construction and reconstruction."</p>

<p>Unemployed workers held a parade and demonstration in the city a few days ago, presenting six demands and requesting government relief. Their representatives have consulted with the Standing Committee. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, eleven worker representatives visited Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Li and the representatives formulated a solution to the various conditions raised by the unemployed workers, with four principles: (1) Unemployed workers in the Hudong district will organize the Fourth District Industrial Union. The General Labor Union will submit a list of all members to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. (2) A Hudong District Re-employment Promotion Committee will be established on a trial basis, with representatives appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, the City Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the General Labor Union. The committee will have a secretary and an investigation and registration team to investigate the actual conditions of various factories, the degree of possible re-employment, the difficulties in re-employment, and the registration and organization of workers. When the Re-employment Promotion Committee holds a meeting, it will discuss the re-employment promotion methods based on the report of the registration team. If necessary, the relevant trade unions or factory representatives may be invited to attend the discussion. (3) Original factory workers who were unwilling to cooperate with the enemy and puppets and withdrew from the factory may be given priority for employment, provided that they provide sufficient proof. Next, original factory workers who were dismissed after the victory will be employed. (4) Measures to guarantee the livelihoods of unemployed workers: A. Relief flour. B. Work-for-relief. Worker representatives expressed satisfaction with the above four principles, and the labor union and the promotion association will proceed with organization in accordance with these methods.</p>

<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the High Court, specially summoned Yang Hanzhi for questioning. Yang Hanzhi stated: He is 27 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. His father, Yang Wendao, was falsely imprisoned ten years ago and has not yet been able to see the light of day. He requested that his father be released on bail first for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Judge Liu immediately stated: Yang Wendao was sentenced to death in the first instance and upheld in the second instance by the former Jiangsu High Court Second Branch on December 9, 1936, for the Nakayama Hideo case. After Yang appealed to the Supreme Court, the war broke out, and the case was never finalized. The files were not returned. In September last year, after the victory, Yang Wendao petitioned the Headquarters of the Third Front Army to be released according to the example of political prisoners. The Third Front Army transferred the case to this court. On October 31, Yang Wendao was interrogated, but since the Supreme Court had not made a decision, this court could not express its opinion. Moreover, the original sentence was death, which shows that the case is significant. This court cannot grant bail as an exception. Therefore, on November 1, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions, but no order has been received to date. On December 10, Yang Wendao again petitioned for the restoration of his freedom. The next day, this court issued an order stating, "Instructions have been requested from the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification." On January 17 of this year, Hanzhi petitioned to have his father released on bail first. On January 21, the order stated that the files had not yet been sent down, and no order had been received from the ministry, so it could not be processed. On January 23, the High Court telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration again for instructions. Because the petitioner might not understand the situation, the court was specially convened to explain. Liu also said that in the future, on the one hand, he should still await instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and on the other hand, the petitioner could petition the National Government to request release according to the example of political prisoners. In this way, both judicial and administrative aspects can proceed, or a solution can be sought as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lawyer Tang Huaiqun stood up and said, "We treat Japanese prisoners of war with leniency, but we imprison this patriotic compatriot. Today, not only am I willing to guarantee Yang Wendao, but all the more than ten reporters in court and all four million people in Shanghai are willing to guarantee Yang Wendao."</p>
<p>Judge Liu continued that the situation was serious and should be heard by a joint tribunal. He instructed that a supplementary petition be submitted, and the application of Tang Lawyer was delivered to the High Court at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. According to Tang Lawyer, he believes that Yang Wendao may be released before the end of the lunar year.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Wusong Vicissitudes - Qian Qian <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The blood debt of eight years has begun to be settled. The glorious national flag flies over every inch of our land. Far, far away, at the end of the Yangtze River—Wusong Fort Taiwan lies quietly under the banner of victory. A reporter recently visited there in the drizzle and saw only scars and bullet holes everywhere. Along the way, there were many piles of rubble and a few dilapidated walls barely standing. The Fort Taiwan, over thirty meters above sea level, faces the sea, exposed to the raging waves.</p>
<p>There are more than twenty large and small gun emplacements along the shore that had been destroyed. Under each gun position, there were many piles of shattered large stones, and below that were steel and concrete air-raid shelters. Even though there were no special facilities inside, one had to give them a "dainty" praise. Sometimes, one could find words of war-weariness from the Japanese soldiers and broken beer bottles in the shelters. Unfortunately, several air-raid shelters were filled with sewage and could not be visited. According to local villagers, a skeleton was found in front of one air-raid shelter a few days ago. Behind the fort, there are winding trenches, connected to each other, with a machine gun emplacement at regular intervals. Some of the mud walls have been toppled by wind and rain. Behind the trenches, there are many small pillboxes, all connected by communication trenches. These are all aimed at the surging tide. Whether on the fortresses, in the trenches, or even around the gun emplacements, withered weeds grow everywhere. Due to the climate, they are all withered and make a rustling sound in the sea breeze, as if telling us that we will never see the vainglory and poisonous flames of the war-mongering warlords here again.</p>
<p>Standing on the upper end of the fort and looking back, there is only a desolate scene, piles of grass, high and low graves, interspersed with a few thatched huts or two or three livestock. Looking forward, the entire gray sky is connected to the distant sea. A few large warships are dotted on the distant ocean, and occasionally a few sailboats sail in from the outside. In this silent, everything is silent, situation, Fort Taiwan seems to have been forgotten by the world. It can be said that except for the sound of the tide, there is almost no other sound that can attract attention. The reporter, in this lonely environment of overcast wind and drizzle, mourned the relics of the War of Resistance with nature, prayed for the loyal souls of the martyrs, and felt the endless vicissitudes of life when comparing the past and present.</p>
<p>Later, Chief of Staff Lin Fan-hai of the Wusong Fortress Command told the reporter that after the Japanese army occupied this area, they did not build any more fortifications except for a few more trenches, and it has been desolate ever since. He also said that no matter how strategy or weapons evolve, Wusong will still be an important place for national defense. The concrete plan draft for the future has been submitted, and we believe that the tragedy of history will never be repeated in Wusong in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Business News: Loose Capital Enters the Market on Dips, Gold Prices Relatively Stable, US Dollar Supply Abundant, Price Declines <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of red gold gradually stabilized. Although credit was still tight, those with surplus funds took advantage of the dips to buy for the New Year. The market opened flat in the morning but soon fell as many sellers rushed to cash out, dropping to 880,000. Later, stocks and bonds rebounded sharply after falling, and the gold market also saw loose capital buying on the cheap. Jewelry stores also saw brisk sales. Some firms planned to close early for the New Year holidays, prompting short covering, and the market gradually improved, rising to 900,700 by noon. The afternoon close was 11,000 higher than the previous day. Futures trading did not open in the afternoon, and spot trading rose slightly on sporadic short covering, reaching over 910,000. Trading was light and not widespread. Jewelry stores quoted 97,000 for gold ornaments, 800 yuan for silver taels, and silver dollars rose again to around 495 yuan, with clandestine discounts still at 10 to 12 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange saw a mediocre performance for the US dollar, influenced by gold prices. The morning opened flat at 1,448 yuan, with a low of 1,435 yuan, hovering around 1,445 yuan at noon, with a gold arbitrage of around 620 yuan. The process was extremely uneventful. Although the gold market strengthened in the afternoon, US dollars were sold off, and money changers were willing to cut prices to sell, without seeing a corresponding rise. The end result was a slight decline of two yuan. Hong Kong dollars, old issues, recovered five yuan in stable conditions. New issues once fell below 65 yuan, triggering retail buying on the dips, resulting in a close similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Guangdong Bankers Call, Chinese Stocks Flourish <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were panicked yesterday due to previous fears. Wing On Textiles retreated to 1,370 yuan, Mayar Silk saw 880 yuan, New Kwong Yik 63 yuan, King Fook 62 yuan, and Keen Hing around 54 yuan. Securities firms supported the market on the dips. Guangdong bankers suddenly began buying yarn mills in large quantities. With this assistance, the market's atmosphere suddenly became excited, and other funds followed suit. Despite many twists and turns, Wing On finally broke through three major barriers in succession. Three minor hot stocks also followed, rising by over ten yuan. All stocks closed at higher prices, with Wing On rising 170 yuan compared to the previous close, Mayar 100 yuan, Sincere 60 yuan, King Fook 10 yuan, Keen Hing 6 yuan, and New Kwong Yik 7 yuan. Unpopular stocks, due to lack of time, did not see gains, but had recovered by 10% compared to their lowest levels, and bidding continued to rise.</p>
<p>Due to pressing circumstances, foreign stocks continued to decline in the early session. Later, with the sudden emergence of Chinese stocks, foreign stocks were also favored by buyers, and rose after falling. Bids were snapped up by those who were quick to act. Due to lack of time, trading did not expand much, and all stocks closed at their bid prices. Compared to the previous close, all saw slight improvements, but without sellers, the actual gains were much higher.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Government Bonds See Wild Fluctuations, End Result Similar to Previous Close <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds saw frequent selling yesterday. Domestic bonds broke through three barriers again, reaching a low of 1,090 yuan. Major players in the industry began to take action, and retail investors were encouraged. With the added boost of the stock market rebound, the market successively rose through three barriers, recovering to 1,370 yuan before struggling. The afternoon close was similar to the previous day, with other prices also seeing mixed ups and downs.</p>

<p>Due to workers' eagerness to return home, most dyeing and weaving factories have shut down, leading to a decrease in production. Buyers are increasingly eager to find spot goods, but are unable to do so. Only sporadic transactions are expected for the rest of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Limited Yarn Supply, Yarn Prices Rise Again <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise yesterday, with active export sales. All factories have already sold their spot goods for delivery in February or early March, leading to another increase of 20,000 for all yarn counts. The Textile Reconstruction Company has limited the supply of 20-count yarn in the past two days, leading to a situation of too many monks and not enough porridge. Therefore, 20-count yarn is particularly strong on the market, with strong demand from the flower market.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton trading was not bad, with market prices tightening. The Textile Reconstruction Company purchased 42-count raw material one-inch American cotton Midling at 60,000 yuan, 32-count raw material Tongzhou fine cotton at 65,000 yuan, and South Road fire machine cotton at 45,000 yuan. All of the above are factory delivery prices. Huahao bought open lint cotton at 8,450 yuan, all at stock exchange prices.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Silk Trading Quiet, Rayon Market Halted <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 120-day rayon spot goods were quoted at 1.14 million yuan, but no transactions were made. Exchange orders traded at 730,000 yuan, with more sellers than buyers, and trading was very scarce. With the New Year approaching, market trading has been halted from today and will resume on February 6. Factories, buyers, and sellers are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude, unwilling to sell at low prices and unwilling to buy at high prices, creating a state of stagnation. The same is true for silk goods, with selling prices generally weak and very few transactions. As the closing of accounts approaches, everyone is tightening their belts, and everyone is dispirited.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Rice Market Sees Another Increase <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is rising due to high prices in the interior. Shops are taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. The morning market saw a strong upward trend, with a slight decline in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice rose by 3-500 yuan, and indica rice also rose by 3-400 yuan. However, glutinous rice has abundant supply and remains flat. Flour is also holding firm due to high prices in the interior. Qingdao saw some inquiries, and prices were raised by 2-300 yuan following the rice price increase. Soybean arrivals are scarce, and supply cannot meet demand, rising by 3-400 yuan. The oil market is also rising by 1,000 yuan due to demand exceeding supply and arrivals being less than consumption. Soybean cake is slightly stagnant, and the liquor market is stable.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Optimistic Outlook for the Tea Market <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The distribution of black and green tea styles in this street and by buyers in other places is quite active. Market inventories are low, and the black and green tea stocks in the producing areas have also been bought up by major players, holding them and not releasing them, resulting in an increasingly depleted supply. Therefore, people are more optimistic, and sellers are constantly raising prices, with firm transaction prices. It is feared that there will still be a booming atmosphere after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Sugar Slightly Soft <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Sugar prices have been weakening in recent days due to buyers being eager to sell their goods. The market is getting weaker. One buyer offered a few hundred bags, even breaking the 40,000 barrier, which is a 20% drop from the previous day's offer, but this was a private transaction and not public.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Shortage and High Prices of Hard White Lead Wire <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>

Market inventories are being bought up, and asking prices are getting higher and higher. Recently, the price has opened at 39,000 yuan per dan, creating an unprecedented high.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Since the city's Social Affairs Bureau started registration, the number of people collecting and filling out forms has been very enthusiastic. As of recently, it has been heard that over 10,000 households have registered. The district and phased system has been broken. Recently, due to the transition between the old and new administrations, the transfer of duties is being processed. Therefore, it will be temporarily suspended from the 25th. Once the new administration takes over, it will be handled as usual.</p>

<p>The coated paper needed for the printing industry is gradually depleting in the city, and actual sales are strong. If no more goods arrive next spring, alternative products will have to be used. Although the printing industry has already placed orders, it is still unknown what the import tax rate will be and when the goods will arrive. Therefore, the printing industry in the city has started to actively seek solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Imported paper prices are rising again, with wood-free paper becoming even more profitable. Buyers are liquidating their positions to buy goods for the New Year, and are afraid to release their holdings due to the excessive rise in spot prices. In addition, cigarette companies are buying in bulk, driving up prices and creating the current market phenomenon.</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics are seeing scarce transactions, with sellers unwilling to offer prices, waiting for good prices. Buyers are also refraining from action due to the high prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market was stagnant and stable, mainly because the Lunar New Year is approaching and credit is tight. Buyers are slightly hesitant, and the market is gradually weakening. Prices for all goods have slightly declined.</p>
<p>The Sichuan and Hunan gangs have strong demand for dyes, including hemp blue, vulcanized black, etc., which are being purchased.</p>
<p>The market for chemical raw materials is still sluggish, and transactions remain slow. The market price of caustic soda continues to fall, and other prices are trending downwards.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk scarves and gauze scarves rose in price, and socks saw few transactions. Only undershirts are seeing strong demand.</p>
<p>Yesterday's brick and tile prices increased slightly compared to the previous ten days. Procurement in the interior has been very active recently. Kiln prices have increased by 10%. However, lime boatmen are eager to unload their goods and return home, slightly lowering prices.</p>

<p>Since the Central Bank was ordered to facilitate domestic remittances and stabilize exchange rates, the Chongqing-Shanghai exchange rate has been declining daily.

Once sea and land transportation are unimpeded, the domestic exchange rate is expected to be stabilized. The bank has recently revised the domestic exchange rates for various places with the three banks and two bureaus. Please see the attached table for details.

<h3 id="e92">Education and Sports: Minister Zhu's Message to Recovered Area School Faculty and Students: Rectify Academic Atmosphere, Prevent Student Unrest <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Teachers and staff share the current arduous task. Strict discipline should be applied to young students.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Special Dispatch] Minister of Education Zhu recently issued a message to faculty and students of secondary and higher schools in the recovered areas. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>#### Continuation of Studies</p>
<p>(1) Students Continuing Studies and Advancing to Higher Education: Our country has endured eight years of the War of Resistance, scarred and devastated. Although we have now achieved victory, the people are still suffering. The Central Government is striving for urgent measures to save the people from fire and water, and is also planning active construction to lay the foundation for a century-long plan. The complexity and importance of this task can be imagined. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, during the Educational Post-War Restoration Conference convened by the Ministry, earnestly instructed the participants, "Military affairs are the priority during the War of Resistance, and education is the priority during national reconstruction." Following this instruction, the Ministry has, in coordinating various educational restoration and post-war problems, paid more attention to the emergency measures concerning education in the recovered areas, and among these emergency measures, the issue of continuing studies and advancing to higher education for students in secondary and higher schools should be prioritized as the prerequisite and core.</p>
<p>#### Avoid Negative Suppression</p>
<p>(2) Focus on Active Cultivation, Avoid Negative Suppression: How to determine the qualifications of students who originally studied in schools set up by the enemy and puppet regimes, and provide them with an outlet for continuing their studies and advancing to higher education? How to assess the level of students who have secluded themselves in the occupied areas and devoted themselves to self-study, according to their wishes, and provide them with opportunities to enroll and further their studies? These issues have all been addressed by the Ministry in timely planning and preparation, resulting in the formulation of various screening methods and other remedial measures. All these measures are intended to provide convenience for young people and solve difficulties for students, and should not be seen as a restriction on individual advancement. Furthermore, temporary university preparatory classes and temporary secondary schools have been established to prevent students from wasting their studies and time. The restoration of schools and the establishment of new schools are also being prepared and gradually implemented, and are under serious discussion. The government's consideration of gains and losses, and assessment of priorities, day and night without rest, is truly because the century-long plan begins with cultivating talent, fearing the spiritual emptiness of young students and their lack of purpose. The student screening methods are, in fact, measures to facilitate students' continued studies. At the very least, it is an unavoidable assessment, and the Ministry has instructed those in charge to handle it as leniently as possible within the scope of the regulations. It should be understood that this method is definitely aimed at active cultivation, not motivated by negative suppression, which anyone with common sense can discern without deep thought.</p>
<p>#### Teachers and Staff Exemplify Youth Through Personality</p>
<p>(3) Teachers and Staff Exemplify Youth Through Personality: It is hoped that the teachers and staff in the recovered areas will set an example and inspire young people with their personality. Set an example, work together harmoniously, and hope to contribute to the difficulties of the times. Understand the difficulty of national reconstruction and the hardships of saving the times. All students must cultivate their personality and concentrate on self-cultivation. Remember the responsibility of every individual for the rise and fall of the nation, and understand the government's care for young people and its thoughtful intentions. Uphold propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as teachings, and embody and practice them in every word and deed. Abide by discipline, as the foundation for service and responsibility; cultivate great talent, as preparation for serving the country. During my recent tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, I have learned that students in various schools, under the coercion and enslavement policies of the enemy and puppet regimes, have been able to maintain their self-esteem and uphold courtesy. I hope that those in charge of teaching in all classes and schools will guide and cultivate young students, and strive to establish strict discipline. This is not only beneficial to the students themselves, but also a blessing for the future of education. The Minister looks forward to seeing this happen.</p>
<p>#### Prevent Student Unrest</p>
<p>(4) Rectify Academic Atmosphere, Prevent Student Unrest: However, in recent times, educational discipline has been declining. Student unrest is frequently heard in various places, with posters used to scold and abuse, or crowds gathered to beat and humiliate. Every request is made with marches and strikes as threats, and exams are rejected in an attempt to muddle through, disrupting singing and creating disorder. This allows unscrupulous elements to take advantage of the situation, fueling the flames to serve their ulterior motives. Those with knowledge sigh and lament, and foreigners will spread it as a laughing stock. Recalling past student unrest, the greatest sacrifices were made by the students themselves, lightly wasting their studies and time, and seriously resulting in unfortunate incidents, making senseless sacrifices. If this is not prevented and stopped, the trend will spread, and the future of education will be unimaginable! The students of the Nanjing Temporary University Preparatory Class, due to opposing exams, gathered to make trouble, shouting and roaring, and even beating and humiliating teachers. Most of the ringleaders have been identified and severely punished according to law, without condoning or indulging, to stop the arrogance of a few and protect the interests of the majority of students. It is the duty of the Ministry to not allow this kind of bad academic atmosphere to exist during this period of national reconstruction. If we continue to yield and let students stray and not return, we will not only fail to live up to the parents of the students, but also fail to live up to the Chairman's emphasis on rectifying the academic atmosphere!</p>
<p>#### Complete Arduous Task</p>
<p>(5) Work Together to Complete Arduous Task: Learning from the past and encouraging the future, time cannot be wasted again. I am willing to share this arduous task with the faculty and staff of all provinces and cities in the recovered areas. I sincerely invite our young students to abide by our promises and strive to practice them. We must each work hard, engage in in-depth studies, cultivate our talents, be loyal to the country, and fulfill the Minister's sincere expectations. If there are those who do not abide by discipline and whose words and actions are excessive, the schools will be ordered to severely punish them. If their habits are too ingrained and they cannot be cultivated, they will be resolutely expelled. Those who gather to make trouble, disregard the law, and engage in violent and destructive actions will be severely punished according to law, even if it affects the future of the entire school. I hope that teachers and staff will work together to set an example. Students should deeply reflect, cherish themselves and love the country, encourage each other, and be vigilant with each other, so as not to disappoint the Chairman's high expectations. Do not treat what has been said above as mere words! (Heng)</p>

(4) Graduation screening experiments and grade placement screening exams are uniformly handled by schools designated by the Department of Education. (5) For public and private secondary schools under the enemy and puppet regimes in the recovered areas of the province that have been taken over and reorganized by the Department of Education and the Municipal and County Governments, their graduated students should participate in the exams designated by the Department of Education, and the grade placement experiments for students in school shall be handled by the reorganized schools themselves. (6) The graduation screening test questions are uniformly set by the Department of Education, and the grade placement screening questions are set by the agent schools themselves. (7) The grade placement screening will be held from January 22 to 25 this year, and the graduation screening will be held from January 27 to 28 this year.

After the victory, Principal Jiang earnestly resigned, and Ji Hao, a member of the board of directors, was hired to succeed him. Mr. Ji served as the school's training director for many years before the war.

<h3 id="e99">First Division Soccer Game Yesterday: Rain Hindered Effort <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah and Italian Overseas Chinese Tied One Each</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, it rained lightly, and the soccer game was held as scheduled, but the process was inevitably diminished because the field was muddy and slippery. As a result, Tung Wah failed to win against Italian Overseas Chinese. The ability of Italian Overseas Chinese to return to normal is admirable. The game ended in a one-to-one tie. No score was recorded in the first half. Nearly 10,000 spectators left disappointed in the rain.</p>
<p>Tung Wah used its most ideal lineup yesterday, and everyone was confident of victory. Referee He Chunhui, Tung Wah came on the field, and the offensive was extremely strong. Taiwan's Sai Ka's defense was skillful, making it impossible for Tung Wah to enter. After repeated attacks failed, they inevitably felt discouraged. In the second half of the first half, Italian Overseas Chinese also had many attacks. Tung Wah could not score, and its defense was very strong. There were no records.</p>
<p>It was still raining in the second half, and the ground was wet and the ball gradually became heavier. Tung Wah was even more disadvantaged and showed signs of not being able to do what it wants. Three minutes into the half, Ya Tuomali shot from 30 yards away, and it hit the post and bounced in. Zhang Banglun carelessly lost Jingzhou and watched it enter. Italian Overseas Chinese took a 1 - 0 lead. Stimulated by this, Tung Wah launched a major attack, but haste makes waste. The spectators on the scene were anxious on their behalf. Until the last minute, Tung Wah went all out. Sun Jinshun received Dai Linjing's pass and succeeded in one fell swoop, creating a tie. The time then ended immediately. It was a pity that Tung Wah did not win yesterday.</p>

Looking back at the 30-year history of the domestic film industry, in the past pioneering era, due to backward technology and outdated script content, it was almost disdained by audiences who loved domestic films.
