<h3 id="c3">綜合審查委會通過國大總統召集　立院職權討論仍無結果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕綜合審查會十六日下午三時半舉行第三次會，出席代表一五五人，陳誠主席，首報吿主席團會議，提出召集人會議決定之事項如次：（一）綜合會審查範圍，（二）整理小組之組織，（三）自本次會議起，依照秘書處印發之議事日程依决進行，凡同一議題之發言，每人以二次爲限，每次發言以五分鐘爲度，報吿畢，略有意見，旋即多數通過。主席繼即宣布討論問題八項，（一）國大職權問題，（二）國大集會問題，（三）人民服公役問題，（四）第四章章節問題，（五）緊急事變問題，（六）立院職權問題，（七）立委名額問題，（八）審計權問題，茲分誌討論情形如後：</p>
<p>國大職權</p>
<p>（一）國大職權間題，其中有關少數民族名額問題，主席報吿稱尙未硏究完畢，暫不討論。繼有多數代表發言，民社黨蔣勻田首稱：對修改之憲草，有若干處不能同意，如原案立委係人民選舉，監委係各省參議會選舉，現均改爲國大選舉，實不能同意。司法。考試兩院院長，亦不應由國大選出，因此等皆爲專門人才，考試院長應由總統提名，不應由國大選舉，亦不應由國大罷免。選舉立委，係直接民權，應由人民直接選舉，應維持原案。民社黨代表朱鴻儒發言稱：經過修改之憲草，國大職權太大，幾將憲草原則全部推翻，目前世界民權制度有兩種，一代議制，二直接民權制，中山先生是主張後者，今國大已置於五院以上，如何行使民權，頗成問題，國大實已違背了直接民權之原則。國大代表任期爲六年，而國大則每二年開會一次，在休會期中，何人行使政權，以國大置於立法院之上，則立院顯已爲間接而又間接之民權，攷試，司法均增超黨派的，應由總統選賢任能，如無修正案，則此國大將成爲一權憲法矣。靑年黨代表陳啓天繼發言稱：本人深深感到，中國所以未能完成一部好的憲法的原因，乃基於各方固執成見，且未顧到兩件事，一是不顧及憲法能發生好的效果，而去顧到國際形勢，一是未注意到實際效用，故不能得到成功的因素。根據以上兩點，國大職權較五五憲草所訂尤高，將使國際形勢更趨惡化，本人並非爲青年黨講話，而是爲全國同胞講話，此一問題，可能引起政治上變化，本人認爲，修正案對國大之職權擴大，不會有何效果，因國大二年開會一次，實難談到實際效用，吾人欲實現眞正的民意監督政府，並非必要把權力集中於國大，而是要分開，主張維持原案，旋經討論，將第廿七條第三款「憲法修改之創議」改爲「修改憲法」，付表決時，以一一七票多數通過。</p>
<p>集會問題</p>
<p>（二）國大集會問題，副秘書長雷震報吿修正案，將原案第廿九·卅。卅一三條改爲兩條，討論後，決定第廿九條修改爲「國民大會每屆總統任滿前九十日，由總統召集之」。第卅條用修正意見，第卅一條删去。</p>
<p>人民服役</p>
<p>（三）人民服公役問題，第廿一條第一審查會曾經修正，增加「工役」字樣，民社黨曾提出異議，認爲加入工役，則易爲各級政府官吏·鄉長·保甲·土劣所利用，剝奪人民自由，引起社會不寗，應仍維原案。此案曾引起爭辯，旋由陳誠退出主席地位稱：主張維持原案，當即多數通過。</p>
<p>四章章節</p>
<p>（四）第四章之章節問題，因有人生脹第四章應改爲中央政府，而將總統·行政·立法等列爲節首者，有人認爲不必分章，史尙寬·林彬等均有發言，最後由李敬齋提，認爲應交整理小組，當即通過。</p>
<p>緊急事變</p>
<p>（五）緊急事變問題，江一平發言，維持原案，不必加此四字，當時立即通過。</p>
<p>立院職權</p>
<p>（六）立法院職權間題，第六十二條有多數意見，有認爲「國家」二字應改爲「中央」，有認爲「立法機關由人民選舉之」應改爲「由人民組織之」，有認爲「最高」二字極不妥，當討論極久，無結果，即決議交整理小組。</p>
<p>立委名額</p>
<p>（七）立委名額問題，第六十五條多數主張維持原案，惟將其第一款內每省巿五人改爲二人，每滿一百萬人增加一人，改爲每滿五百萬人增加一人，至新疆，華僑各代表名額問題，仍交整理小組</p>
<p>審計言權</p>
<p>（八）審計權問題七十五條照原案，七十六條删去，改爲兩條如决：（一）監察院設審計長，由總統提名，經立法院同意任命之，（二）審計長於審核結束後三個月內，提出審核報告於立法院，五時三刻散會。</p>

<h3 id="c4">憲草修訂爭辯聲中　民社黨表白態度　要求維持政協商談原則 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕民社黨秘長金侯成，十六日於中宣部記者招待席上，說明該黨對憲草之三點意見稱：</p>
<p>（一）關於憲法第一條原文，曾經第一審委會修改爲「中華民國三民主義民主共和國」，後又經綜合委會修改爲「中華民國基於三民主義爲民主共和國」，該黨認爲本條係規定國體者，最好改爲「中華民國爲民主共和國」。據稱，關於此點，蔣總裁與該黨及靑年滅代表晤面時同意將「三民主義」四字莊重改加於前言之中。</p>
<p>（二）關於國大一章，該黨認爲於原有國大職權之外，不便再有任何增加。現聞綜委會，對國大職權增加如下之一條：「國民大會爲代表中華民國國民行使政權之最高機關」。該黨認此種加添，亦屬不妥。蓋如是，實違反民主之基本精神。根據憲草，除國大而外，尙有一立法院，皆係直接選舉產生，國大之職權，僅限於如美國之選舉總統，若照目前之修改，則近乎一權制，影響立法院，推行時不妥且不民主。</p>
<p>（三）根據憲草原文，總統在若干情形之下得發布緊急命令，而目前審查之結果，加上「緊念事變」四字。憲法爲國家百年大法，非對人問題，而爲永久問題，增加「緊急事變」等字樣，實嫌不妥，故該黨主張維持原案。</p>
<p>關於第一點，蔣總裁曾有書面文件，贊成修正。</p>
<p>關於後述二者，因在蔣總裁與兩黨代表晤談之後發生問題，故未談及，惟信蔣總裁亦感覺，國大職權以不加爲宜，金並指出該黨對土述三點最重視，其他不甚重要之細節皆可以妥協方法解決。該黨相信，我中華民國所以得有此一機會從事制憲工作，係因國民黨通達事理，盼能通達到底制憲工作得以完成。</p>
<p>本日招待會，本請由該黨徐傳霖出席，因徐出席綜合華委會，故改由金氏及該黨另一國大代表李俊夫出席，金除報吿該黨對憲草之態度外，尙答覆其他與該黨有關諸問題。</p>
<p>某記者詢以將來大會中，對上述三點若不能獲致爲民社黨滿意之結果時，民社黨將採何種態度</p>
<p>金答：該黨相信此次國大，係根據政協而來，憲草未能全依政協原則擬定，該黨表示遺憾。國民黨人亦有採同樣看法者，國民然向通達事理者佔大多數，盼能心平氣和，認該黨對此無表明態度必要。</p>
<p>另一記者詢以是否將參加改組後之政府？據答，政協當時確曾協議由各黨派合組政府，惟此事之實現，尙有待於可能組織此類政府時機之來臨，因此該黨尙未考慮及此。關於該黨與民盟之關係，金稱：該黨態度不變，盼民盟及共產黨能予諒解。至民盟中常會是否將令該黨退盟，金謂不敢斷定，須待此類情事時再加考慮。有詢該黨本身南北之爭，金承認有此謠言，惟稱，至少在參加國大一點，黨內全體一致。對外傳該黨某黨員染有不良習慣事，金拒絕作答。</p>
<h3 id="c5">馬司聯袂晤主席　王炳南訪司使曾作長談　或係談派員赴延安事件 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕馬特使及司徒大使十五日下午五時曾聯袂訪晤蔣主席。共產黨辦事處王炳南，十六日上午十二時訪司使，晤談一小時，據共產黨發言人梅益稱，司使係將十五日晚晤蔣主席所談一切，非正式吿王炳南，但此純爲普通社交來往，決不能表示和談有重開之可能。梅對外傳政府派員赴延一事稱，尙無所悉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕邵力子頃對記者談稱，本人對於赴延安事，尙無所聞，惟本人希望國共能眞誠團結合作，故如政府眞派本人去，自當爲之。邵繼表示，是日馬司同訪蔣主席，以及王炳南今日訪司使，可能即談派員赴延事件。</p>
<h3 id="c6">邵力子談憲章 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕據邵力子表示，對於憲草通過問題，甚樂觀，認爲若干反對意見雖在審查會中有所成就，然在綜合會中乃至大會中，必因人數少而遭受否決。張君勵所提四點意見，邵完全表示同意，認爲正確。</p>

<p>暹羅這個國名還是中國人給它的它的稱呼。暹羅本是暹和羅兩個國家的名稱。暹即暹國，由後漢的哀牢國，唐代的南詔國，宋朝的大理國演變而成，建城於孟凡。暹之聲與撣之聲相近，地理學家認暹國恐係撣國。羅係羅斛國，據有眞臘和素可太地。一三一七年，暹王坤拉堪漢卒，國勢日衰，惠宗至正間，羅斛遂併吞了暹國，吾國朝廷反以被征服者名稱放在前面，合而稱爲暹羅。</p>
<p>中暹關係歷史悠久，至少在二千乍前，有史可據一者迄今已達一八七七年，邊人未侵入眞臘吉蔑地前，與我即有往還。此後經後漢，梁，隋，三國，唐宋，元明，淸，世世人貢。同治八年因拒其呈獻用授受儀式面停貢，彼此遂少接觸。</p>
<p>地理上中暹似一家，歐洲人寄信到暹羅的信封上時時寫着「中國暹羅一，暹羅人口據政府一九三七年統計已達一四，九九六，〇〇〇，華僑三百餘萬佔全人口四分之一。實在今日的暹人，大牛已混合着中國的血統特別是政要方面許多人是中國血。暹元老　巴立即是一個　着苦的例，他的祖籍是廣東澄海夏塘鄉，華名陳嘉樂。暹羅種族有泰·老撾·柬埔寨和撣，　中國民族也很多，除中國人外，其餘皆奪族或太族或汰　族支派。</p>
<p>據考古學家義大利人　立尼（C．Gerini）　今日中國　南雲貴桂三省火多太族，　南西部的　夷即太族的一種，與　　民族同一系統，廣西，廣西龍州等地的方言多和現在　　相通，風俗語言亦多相似，此即坐實中暹之難於分開。</p>
<p>中國人救過暹羅二次，一次是蘇科台王巴蘇支初立時，國亂，中國發戰士和武士器匠製砲平之。另一次在一七六七年，（乾隆三十二年）服官暹羅的廣東潮州人趙德臣（或稱　昭或稱鄭信，實昭爲暹文國王之意，信乃暹語財富之意）獨破　軍的侵略，奠定了今日退羅自由獨立的國基。</p>
<p>暹羅文化的演變可分三時期，一爲佛敎文化，二爲中國文化，三爲歐化。第二期的文化趨勢是因政治變動而變動，趙德臣起而復國，暹人對中國甘拜下風，趙氏亦加以宣傳，國人至暹日衆，文化的高超遠非暹所能及，以此舉國上下爭學華化，文字藝術皆受吾影饗，卒造成了中暹混合文明。</p>
<p>世人盡知暹以產米，錫，樹膠，柚木四大物資著名，每年佔輸出額百分之八十左右，殊不知這些主要物資的開發，皆華僑爲之領導，爲之流血汗，今日暹羅之能家給戶足，屹然獨立於亞洲，是則中國固無負於暹羅，乃暹羅自停貢以後，始終對我不起，一九二〇年即取締我華僑學校，一九三二‘年政變後，實施新經濟政策，從事排華，一九三九年變披汶頌堪與鑒咸集哇地干穿通日人改國名爲泰國，倡「唯國主義」，（Rathaniyom）專以華僑爲唯國的對象，以排華辱蕪爲唯國。吾國抗戰正在緊要關頭，　當局媚日排華，變本加厲，聘日人爲顧問，頒訂二十一種排華苛例，這種進逼，一步緊一步，一天緊一天，遍到僑商破產，僑校關門，華僑生命財產危如纍卵。</p>
<p>祖國抗戰勝利，暹羅華僑未得勝利，相反的因勝利而遭受浩劫，一直鬧到八月卅。但中國與人友好絕對不建立於「投機」「利用」的基礎上，惟有　於　義和公理上的友好，始能恒久在在。蔣主席在中國命運一再說過，「中國的政治哲學，在使戰爭與生產的技術，爲人生服務」，所以「在山國强盛的時期，亞洲民族從沒有經濟侵略與、政冶兼併的史實，亦不見有帝國主義與殖民地之分」，正如社魯門　謂「追求安全，應該是尋求整個世界的共同安全，而不是爲求一個國家的安全，反而咸脅世界的安全」。</p>
<p>暹羅因蔣主席和杜魯門的二項聲明而安全了，但我們華僑在暹羅尙未安全，妨害華僑敎育和經濟的法令條例迄未取銷或修正，三百萬華僑還惴惴然寢食不安，我們歡迎暹大使乃沙浣，杜拉叻駐華後、期望能促進暹人思想更有進步。由科學的發達，地球已在縮小。偉大的人物不能再陷於排他性的狹隘的國家主義的窠臼中。這次暹元老訪問中國前對本報記者說起諺語二句，他說「狹地能居，狹心難處，」這是値得體味的。</p>
<p>中遏是一家人中暹關係是永遠分不開的，但我們的友好，還應該進一步。</p>
<h3 id="c43">從北大的校慶說起 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>今日是國立北京大學成立四十八周年紀念日，是「北大」的校慶。本來在目前的中國，大學的數字也已　不小，其中且有很多也同樣是國立的；一個大學的校慶，除由該校同人表示慶祝外，未必一定能引起全國的注意。然而北大的校慶却是特別的。第一就歷史上來說，北大是近代我國立大學巾最早的一個，自京師大學堂以迄於今，雖其間迭有變革，而一脈相承，至今猶爲最高學府之領袖者，怕只有「北大」。第二是因爲北天是我國近代惟一的國立大學，北大的師生在今日中國的社會　都是中堅的人物，布滿在全國的各階膾，在近代中國社會裏是會經起了相富作用的。所以今日北大的校慶，就是北大以外的人，也無不同申慶祝。四十人年在我們的民族歷史裏是一個極短的時間；然而過去的四十八年却在我們民族歷史上是一個極重要的關頭。在這一個時期內，我們看見有日本帝國的興亡，和中國民族的出死入生，以八年的長期抵抗擊潰了日本侵略的企圖。如今抗戰勝利，國立北京大學在校長胡適任內度此校慶，我們深信今後的北大，必能本過去的光輝而益有所發揚光</p>
<p>當我們提起北大，誰也不能忘懷當年的五四運動，如何在北大的領導之下，推重了國民革命的高潮，這是中國民族自覺運動及政治民主運動最有　義的一頁。這一運動在中國文化及社曾政治生活上所起的影響，可以說是空前的。參加這一運動的人。現在多是中年後的人物了。當年這種蓬勃的朝氣，如今也已消沈。今日而來紀念北大的校慶，我們也誠不免感觸多端。我們不能讓這種消沈的局勢持續下去。我們必須設法發揚光大當年的五四精神，纔是紀念北大校慶最有意義的舉措。這五四精神是什麼？是在求民主，求自由。中國的學生在五四運動時起了最大的作用，似乎是與十九世紀中葉的德國學生運動在人類歷史上後先輝映。而在當時的中國學生運動，北大無疑地是處於領導的地位。五四已經成爲歷史了；但五四的精神至今還是需要發揮的。今日我們而來記念北大的校慶，這是使我們想起的第一點。</p>
<p>其次當年的北大是國內的惟一的最高學府，如今大學的設立，在量的方面，遍及全國，在質的方面，却一般的低落；而且對於大學敎育本身的目的到如今亦愈益不淸，當年蔡元培先生主持北大的時候，參酌了歐洲大陸及英美大學的優畏，旨在造就通我。所以特重人文與學術研究。目前大學敎育的趨勢似乎在造就高等工匠，而不在於通才的培植，這似乎已失大學敎育的本旨。大學所應注重的在學術的獨立研究，而不在知識技能的傳授。因値北大的校慶，使我們感覺到對於目前我國的大學敎育，實有再檢討的必要。我們先要認淸大學敎育的目的，再來謀進一步的改革。至於在大學的質量方面，我們以爲量的增加必　　質，如今大學敎育在質的方面之低落，雖原因並不單純，但量的增加，無可避免的，必致影響質的低落。所以我們認爲與其辦多量的大學而使它有質的降落，實毋寗辦少量的大學而使它有質的提高。一國著名的大學爲數決不多，一國的國立大學在水準上應與其它國家的著名大學相平。</p>
<p>然而以目前我國局勢而言，現階段的我國大學敎育，這　面所牽涉到的問題本甚廣泛；其間原有相互的綜錯關係。大學經費的支絀，影響於大學敎育之發展者自然甚鉅。而大學經費的支洲　又以常前的政治經濟局勢有以造成之。但我們却不能因其關係的複雜而不思改進。由於北大的校慶，應該使我們想到如何刷新我們的高等敎育。國家的長治久安，繫於大學敎育的關　。實在不輕；我們不能再蹉陀四十八年。</p>

<p>— 杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>三十五年十二月十一日，這世界馳名的西子湖換上了雪裝，據這幾年沒有離開杭州人們講在冬天裏，這樣整天繼續不斷地下着大雪花，是十年來所少見的，即是去年抗戰勝利後的第一個冬天，滿以爲瑞雪會隨勝利以俱來，那裏知道偏不讓西子披上皚皚的雪裝，使闊別九年的遊子們欣賞流覽。</p>
<p>醜惡都掩蓋了</p>
<p>十一日的大雪，使這正在建設中的花園都市，眞的把醜惡都掩蓋了，盡是那潔白美麗，正是一個綺麗的公園。從湖濱瞭望許多環抱西子湖的山，似乎更來得近了。蘇堤白堤上已將枯萎了的枝葉，堆成一朶朶雪白的花球，三潭印月的小瀛洲，湖心亭，阮公墩，博覽會紀念塔，成了在湖中的四朶各各不同的大白繞球，寳叙塔與寳叔山都像是銀質的鉅鼎，湖濱公園裏的幾枝傲菊，尙在與凌雪戰鬥，但終究也被塗上了白的顏色。恐怕只有孤山的梅，趁這一朝大雪，可以趕緊發芽成苞了。果然有幾個有豪與的人，去到斷　路雪，　在湖擯拆了篷的划子，因爲堆滿了雪，反把蕭條冷寂的情況飾去了。那間着的划子，求乞的乞丏，城隍山上的相士，英士街邊的妓女，都銷聲匿跡，靜靜地，安逸的西子在當時確顯出了純潔與高貴。</p>
<p>潔白祇是憧憬</p>
<p>可惜，雪不是麵粉，不是棉絮，更不是可以兌換的白銀，她不能使整個西子湖濱的窮困者獲得溫暖飽滿。她這種施與是假的，她又將很快的逝去，當逝去的時候，一切醜惡又將暴露無遣。所以雪根本是敷衍的，她只是這樣來一下，讓人們憧憬這潔白，企望這光明，然而一切的腐敗還在她潔白下滋長呢！你如不信，失依兒童敎養所的一羣兒童，冒着風雪，赤着一雙小腿，在雪地裏奔跑，來找尋另一批失依的兒童，結果有十二個小孩子被他們招進了隊伍。另外，棉衣和麵粉，正是貧窮人們顫悚着迫切的需求，但是像十一日這樣的「雪中送賓」贈衣贈粉的好機會，都給錯過了。難道讓在大太陽下再來表示仁慈嗎？「救困如救火」，我希望千萬別再推敲着手續，趕快調查確實，急加施予，不要儘在計劃如何寫報告書上用功夫吧！</p>
<p>最近，行總浙江分署爲了公敎人員，布棉調換舊衣，擠得很厲害，七八個人因擠而下了水，一個人落了坑，還是得不着一個圓滿的結果，我們中國人是疏忽的，也是喜歡小便宜的，在這兩種根性的流露下，對銷了發生的不幸，儘管幾家報紙在嚷着喊着。</p>
<p>在這大雪之後</p>
<p>在這大雪以後，恐怕違警的事件要在這嚴冬裏增加着，以往，據十一月的統計，其中以類似睹博，事涉混亂，妨害交通，妨害他人身體自由四項違警爲最多。杭州東南日報以「如此杭州！」爲題，請讀者看違警案的統計，但是這冰般的嚴冬，以上的事件旣沒有方法由可以減少，而且饑寒交迫的貧困者，他們將需要什麼，自然又當在違警案中另列一案。</p>
<p>各家商店，在這大雪紛飛中，猶鼓其不能再鼓的勇氣，開燃了霓虹燈，使無綫電擴音機拼力呌喊，但店負們彎了背，袖緊了手，閒着無事，這是商業不景氣聲中崩潰的前夜。只有高利貸者才在這風雪交加中燃起爐火，擁着姑娘嬉樂，然而他們的命運也已注定了的，如果他們把一切貸款的對象都殺減了，他們也只有倒下去，同歸於盡。</p>
<p>瑞雪兆豐年！</p>
<p>比較可聽的一句話，就是「瑞雪兆豐年」。是的，這一塲雪，使病虫害都凍死了。但農村裏的老農夫，已是不堪負累，提不起「瑞雪兆豐年」的興繳，這幾年來，農村中辛苦得來的錢，盡向外面流，成了游資不算數，又變了高利貸，重又來剝削農村，土地的利用是有限的，人的精力也是有限的，而况農村裏的人口漸漸地逃離了農村，這農村的血液快要抽盡了，在城市裏的人們，還談什麼「瑞雪兆豐年」呢？近來農產品挑出農村，就來了重重的剝削，一層層利潤加上去，農村沒有得到利益，農民沒有得到利益，僅是一些中間的吸血虫肥了。因此在道「瑞雪」之下，猪肉貴了，蔬菜貴了，鷄蛋貴了，甚至連葱蒜豆腐都貴了，這些漲價後的利潤，我們要請考查一下，如果眞正惠及農民，到也于應該，可惜這些利潤使最後的獲得者轉而又去做高利貸的賣買了。</p>
<p>請回到農村去</p>
<p>在今天的西子湖，今天的杭州市，可說大半還是仰仗農村來滋養的。如果我們忽略這一點，那麼這美麗的西子湖也要枯萎衰敗的。因此，在這嚴冬裏，我們有理由要求一些高呼着冬令救濟的人們，預備大量麵粉棉衣救濟的人們，如果他們還沒有尋到貧窮的對象，請他們到枕州市附近的農村中去調查一下，去施捨一下。如果都市中的貧困者，他們要責問何以特別重視農村？我們可以請他們回到農村去工作，免得在都市裏閒困着。</p>
<p>這些爲大洋樓裏，門面裝璜得金碧輝煌的銀行錢莊們，請你們休息一下城市中的貸款吧！趕快把金錢放貸到農村去，使農村滋養一下，再不要放出去讓人家做高利貸吧！因爲銀行錢莊本身將要遭到厄運呢！</p>
<p>喚醒花園都市</p>
<p>銀，粉，棉絮，都被雪所象徵了，「瑞雪兆豐年」，也許明年可以使社會的情况轉好一些，但看看我們的農村，實在沒有什麼把攙，我們要迫切喊醒這花園都市裏的人們，密切注意這都市附近農村的發展〔十二日〕</p>

<p>〔聯合社印度皮那爾斯十五日電〕印度臨時政府副主席尼赫魯今日在此宣稱：印度將於三日內宣布與不列顚帝國分離。印度制憲議會所議定之憲法將不提請英國會核准。吾人對倫敦已不再期待，決定自身解決問題。國大黨決定勇往直前，英國旣無力阻止印度獨立。回敎同盟領袖實爲反動派，不希望印度自由，而唯英國馬首是瞻。英國或者希望印度立，在印回分治中保持權力，造成種種困難。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕英國消息靈通人士今日談稱：除非回敎聯盟參加印度政府，英國將不接受印度獨立方案，印度臨時政府主席尼赫魯近曾謂印度將於三日內宣布與英國脫離一節，惟英國方面主要認爲印度獨立必須回盟參加臨時政府，無論尼赫魯個人作何聲明，英國主張不變。印度事務部對尼赫魯聲明拒不置評，對萬一印度議會通過議案，宣布獨立，將發生何種結果，亦拒絕討論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十五日電〕印度臨時政府內閣副主席兼外長尼赫魯，日前在制憲會議中提出決議草案之後，本日已引起印度貴族會議之不良反應。據貴族議會負責與制憲會議進行談判之委員會發表公報稱：尼赫魯副主席在制憲會議舉行初步會議時，對於若十基本問題業已提出決議草案，本委員會聞悉之餘，深感遺憾。制憲會議對於此等基本問題，在印度各省未曾推派代表之前，以及各省委負會未與制憲會議英印組之委員會舉行談判之前，不能亦不應加以考慮，或加以決定。決議草案中所提出之各項基本問題，應由印度各省代表舉行談判，草擬能爲印度全國所接受之憲法時加以討論，殊屬顯而易見。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕工黨萊諾新聞報頃發表一文，對於前任首相邱吉爾在下議院所發表之演說，猛烈加以抨擊，其文有日：『下讓院討論印度問題，已歷二日，保守黨對於議會所面臨有關帝國關係之重大問題，不能採取具有建設性之政策，業已暴露無遺。邱吉爾本人以及印度人士希望邱氏領導者，均須明瞭工黨政府旣能爲全國人民所擁護，對於歷史上最偉大之解放行動，自當求其貫澈，且具有絕大決心。以和平的方法轉讓政權，固有極大之困難，但工黨政府不因困難而暗中希望其失敗，並以絕大之忍耐希望由會談妥協而克服此種困難，英國有此種政府，在英印兩國關係上尙屬第一次。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十五日電〕聯大會今日舉行閉幕會議，曾討論若干問題，包括選舉暹羅爲聯合國會員與成立國際難民機關在內。大會並推選烏拉圭爲特委會之第八個委員國，該委會係負責研究委任統治國向聯合國秘書處所提之各項報告書。美代表羅斯福夫人即席爲難民發表動人之呼籲，訴請大會盡力設法，俾使一百萬難民不致落入悲慘與孤寂之深淵。蘇代表葛羅米柯則拒絕與此一機關發生關係，聲稱，該機關並不强調遣返難民工作之最大重要性，反而在難民營中鼓勵難民作反對其祖國之宣傳。會議於下午八時半休會，而於七分鐘後重開，當即以廿五票對五票之多數，通過成立國際難民機關，八票棄權，五票反對票係斯拉夫各國所投。大會更決定難民機關將設於巴黎或日內瓦。原案僅提出巴黎一地，但英代表提出修正案，力言該機關設於國際紅十會總會附近之有利。大會繼即選舉暹羅爲會員國，並未遭遇障碍，下屆大會開會時，該國即可出席矣。議程上最後一項，即爲烏克蘭所提下屆聯大會應在歐洲某地舉行而不在紐約舉行。此項建議付諸辯論時，英代表表示贊成，蘇代表反對，結果決定下屆大會於明年九月仍在紐約舉行。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十五日電〕美代表團長奧斯汀今日在聯大會閉幕前，發表臨別演說，略謂：世界史上朱有一事足以與本屆聯大會比擬者。聯合國在紐約開會，並選擇紐約爲其永久會址，實爲該城之殊榮。八星期前大會在希望與恐懼交織之空氣中揭幕，但目下已經騐一切試煉，相信吾人已實現聯合國之重要目標矣。奧氏繼即强調管制制度與縮减軍備之重要，最後向主席史巴克與聯合國秘書長賴依申謝。</p>

<p>〔聯合社西班牙薩拉哥薩十五日電〕弗朗哥今日在此向十萬羣衆兩度作反抗演說，指全世界處於戰爭局勢，隨時即可宣戰。並謂，唯物主義的生活觀念，在世界繼續存在，無信義及偽善司空見慣，信守協定已成陳跡，此種情形必招致戰爭。新的珍珠港事件並非轟炸港內海軍艦隊，或用原子彈襲擊各城市與工業，而爲利川第五縱隊。此輩具有雙重國籍，一種顯露於外，一種隱藏於內，此輩將破壞吾人之制度。無如愚蠢與無生機之民主國，正甘心開門引狼入室。弗朗哥演說並未直接涉及聯合國大會通過各國召回駐西班牙使節之決議。</p>

<h3 id="c98">英國外交政策（上） <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 卡爾敎授著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>以前英國要等緊急事體發生後才憑直覺有所決定，現在事過境遷，也要事先縝密地計劃一下了。</p>
<p>四十五年以前，每逢德國大使向英國外交部怨訴他本人不能理解不列顚外交政策的時候，當時的外交部次長，從他親筆的紀錄上可以看到，總是回答說：「你應該知道我們根本不曾定過什麼外交政策，而是在做着左手進右手出類似糊口的工作。」英國人從來不在事前研究計劃，總要等緊急事件發生以後方纔憑着直覺「即席作詩」。這個久已成爲英國人的一種普通的誇耀了。</p>
<p>幸運富裕的人們，無論如何，在短時間內總不用靠計劃生活下去，可以不甚經意地消費他們的資源，並且隨意地應用他們的力量。大不列顚帝國在十九世紀的時候是異常幸運和富裕的，但是令日的英國已經絕對不是這樣了。在目前比較窘迫的境况之下，我們必須對於我們的資源節儉地加以善用，避免在不必要的塲合浪費權力。節言之，就是要極端審慎地計劃我們的外交政策。在流行的語言中，「計劃」一詞通常以應用於經濟事件爲多。不過政治上對於計劃的需要，意即在事前算計的需要，實較經濟上有過之無不及。</p>
<p>英國外交基本要點</p>
<p>不列顚外交政策中有幾個固定不易的基礎，無論如何，在一段長時間內，道種不易性將能保持。其中之一就是不列顚的地理環境。我們距離歐陸太近，使我們不得不成爲它的一部份，並且不得不做歐洲人，不管我們願意不願意。另外一個基礎是不列顚的天然資源太缺少，人口則極端過剩。她不能够不靠外來的食物以維持生存，並且她的工業也部份地依靠着進口的原料。這種狀態並不是絕對不能改變的，不過它已往存在了不止一百年，並目在今後一百年以上的時間以內，無論如何也不曾變更。因此這便成爲考慮英國外交政策時應注意的許多要點之一了。由於我們需要的食物和原料並不能在歐洲得到，英國的外交政策必需着眼於別的大陸，對於東西兩半球的每一洲均需加以注意。假使讓我這樣說，就是我們要兩面俱　，我們必需使我們的政策在歐洲及海外的世界之間獲得平衡，讓自己騎在牆上不致於向任何一方面墮落。</p>
<p>以上是英國外交政策中比較固定的諸點，同時我們又須記得過去有許多支配英國外交政策的因素已經變換，並且變換得異常劇烈。假使在許多老生常談中還有一個此較正確的，則這老生常談就應該是我們正生活在一個「變動的世界之中」。在過去五十年，變動的世界上，大不列顚帝國地位的變化實較其他許多事件的變化猶大。在不到五十年以前，偉大的外交大臣沙利斯倍萊爵士曾經高唱顯赫的孤立是不列顚外交政策的基礎。但是今日國中已無一人再要孤立政策了。這事實並不說明孤立本身是好是壤，是顯赫或者還是暗淡。這不過說明了不列顚在世界上的地位已經變更，因之她的外交政策也非隨之改變不可而已。</p>
<p>英國優勢發生動搖</p>
<p>在四十幾年以前具遠見的英國人已經開始發現玫瑰色的英國國運發生轉變。德國和美國的競爭嚴重地侵犯了英國在商業上的優勢。在鋼鐵的生產量（這永遠是工商業的一個指標）上，不列顚開始比德國和美國落後；在遠東和地中海，英國海上勢力的邊緣又顯得難堪地軟弱。波爾戰爭是一個令人憂急的徽象，同時德國在歐洲的倔起威脅了久經建立的大陸均勢。英國已不再强大得足以保持顯赫的孤立，在本世紀的初葉，她改變了傳統政策，終於和日本訂立盟的，並且和法國成立「善意諒解」。經過這些盟邦的支持再加上美國的力量，英國於是在第一次大戰中獲勝。勝利帶來短時期權力和安全的幻覺，德國和俄國正像被蝕的月亮似地黯然無光，美國退縮到她的殼裏，英國的優勢於焉重現。</p>
<p>但是這些臨時的現象是騙人的，事實上第一次大戰加速了英國作爲世界强國相對力量的衰微。我們只要看看一兩個比較顯著的例子便已經足够：第一，英國由於她與大陸隔絕的地位和全球性的商業曾在控制海權上享到過特殊的利益，但是現在空軍力量至少已經和海軍同樣重要。而在航空方面，英國並無優勢的自然條件，甚至在自然條件上還有缺點。區區之島實在不足以鼓勵大量內陸航空運輪的發展。第二，在作戰所用的各種主要燃料之中，油已經代替了煤的地位。作爲主要產煤國家的英國所曾經享受的利益已經爲主要產油國家取了過去。第三，上决大戰刺激了許多國家的工業發展，因而更加破壞了英國經濟上的優勢，自從一九一八年起，美國已經代替了英國有歷史性的全世界第一貿易國的地位。</p>
<p>雖獲勝利實力更弱</p>
<p>英國像在第一次大戰時那樣，已於第二次大戰中獲勝，但是實質上却變得更加衰弱，特別是在和世界列強對比之下，非常顯著。在十九世紀的最初十年中，即使到後來二十年代的時候，我們仍舊可以相信，假使英國需要盟國，她無論如何總是處於選擇朋友的地位的，並且在盟的上多少總可主動地規定一些條件，別國需要英國的比英國需要別國的更多。今日情形是否仍舊如此已成疑問。目前英國正在兩側人口和資源都遠較她本身爲强大的國家所統馭的世界之中尋找盟邦，道便是在五十年代最近的這幾年裘所起的激劇變化，而英國將定的外交政策就正要在此時代中施行。或許有人欲於此際向我提出外交政策並非即爲權力之謂，道義的因素亦應放在決策的考慮之中。以及英國的外交政策須根據某些道德條件等等。我除了由於另外一些理由之外，並且覺得道義亦屬構成權力的要素之一，因此對於道些意見非常同意。權力要黨人民對於某種特定事件在某一特定時間裏願煮聯合一致行動。如果此事件不能令人對之發生値得力爭的信心，則上述情形就絕對不會形成。在以後的演講中，我對於這一點還將加以闡述。</p>
<p>當然權力的物質基礎亦爲外交政策的主要形成分子。如果沒有燃料，則沒有一架機器能够活動。權力就是能使政治機構活動的燃料。我不敢斷定在兩次大戰之間我們曾否犯要想不用煤開駛輪船的錯誤，我們對於日本在中國所爲諸事提過許多高調的抗議，而並不會想定我們對之究竟能够並且願意怎樣做，美國在這一點上，正和我們犯了同樣的錯誤。我希望諸位不要把我看成大儒或是悲觀主義者，我要非常正式地說，外交決策的最重要工作之一即爲「削足適履」，不要對於我們能做什麼，或者應該做什麼多加估計，把世界大事照着我們所喜歡的那樣安排；並且應該不從事在我們合理地希望其能成的事情以外的工作。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會財政委員會及預決算委員會，於昨日下午六時在永安新厦十二樓召開第一次聯席會議，出席潘議長，徐副議長，項秘書長，及議員李文杰，徐永祚，史詠縱，何元明，瞿銊等廿六人。財政局長谷春帆，副局長胡文元，會計長閔湘帆均列席參加。由潘議長任主席。席間谷局長報告三點：（一）原定較秋季加倍征收之冬季市政建設捐。市府已可能自動減免。（二）稅收情形轉好，截至十一月底止，娛樂，旅棧，筵席，營業，屠宰各稅，已較預算增加六十餘億。（三）在秋冬季一百八十億元市政建設捐預算數字下，如冬季依秋季稅額征收可能超過該數字。故依此計算，冬季稅收可酌減二十五億元。出席各參議員以最近市參議會迭接市民來函呈訴，表示稅額太朮，不堪负担。今財局稅收既已轉好，估計之下，冬季市政建設捐尙可核減，乃在然烈討論下，決定「冬季市政建設捐不依秋季稅額加倍征收，並應依秋季原定稅額減三分之一征收，」以副民望。各局長當即表示願將此案轉呈吳市長核定、但聲明保留一點，即明年預算難樂觀，明年稅收情形如不好，則本年冬季已核准加倍之數，仍當補收，以資彌補。</p>
<p>又席間徐永祚議員並報告卅四年度決算已着手審核注意三點：（一）決算與預算是否相合，（二）審查收支數字是否合法，（三）數字是否合乎經濟原則。</p>

<h3 id="c102">救濟失業工人　年前分發麺粉三萬包 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日有關機關舉行救濟失業工人會議，決定以失業工人輔導會所剩餘之麵粉三萬餘包，辦理特別救濟。凡工人失業在半年以上，直系家屬達三人者，均得經區公所證明後，即日至失業工人輔導委員會登記申請。此項救濟工作，預定在陰歷年關前辦完，每人可得麵粉兩袋。又，委員會深感救濟經費之短缺，　重錢少，難以勝任。故定於最　　內召開座談會，邀請各界人士參觀，以期取得社會上之同情援助，募集巨額款項，以進行積極之救濟工作。至於昨日會議之要點，承李副局長見告如下：</p>
<p>招待所中人多錢少</p>
<p>（一）後方來滬失業工人招待所，所址借用公大紗廠之一部，原定收容一〇五〇人，但事實上今日已收容至一千八百人以上，以致環境衛生不良，十一月中患病而死者達二十人。工人之營養亦不足，因過去每日之菜金僅一百元，前會請求增至二百元，亦未批准。招待所之經費，每月僅三百五十萬，但實際支出則在一千萬以上；且十一月十二月之經費均尙未發下。此外尙有歸國僑工一百十一人，現收容在聖心醫院內。聖心醫院尙有餘屋可供收容失業工人之用，惟尙需加以修理。木會決定將工人收容所之現况，改進辦法，及經費預算，於兩日內呈請吳市長，希望能早日批准。至於收容所醫藥衛生之改進，前衛生局已派員視察，木會現議決請衛生局及中國勞働協會協助辦理。</p>
<p>失業工人數逾六萬</p>
<p>（二）關於一般失業工人之救濟，春季中請救濟之失業工人共達八萬人，現估計已復業者不過什一，目前本市之失業工人，在六萬人以上。工商業不景氣，工廠收容失業工人現尙無望，合作工廠之開辦，短期內亦不可能。至於舉辦小本貸款，中央原則上亦同意，所以遲遲米辦者，一爲數目大大，如每人貸給三十萬，六萬人即需九百億；二爲貸款之用途難於選擇，小木經營只有擺攤販，但目前非提倡此類營業之時，因有此兩重困難，小本貸款迄宋辦理。最佳之救濟辦法，當爲以工代賑，惟市政府尙未有此筆經費舉辦。綜而言之，救濟失業工人，必須發動社會力量，方能奏效。另據有關人員告記者：失業工人中境况最慘者，常推後方來滬工人，二千四百入中，迄今僅有三百餘人就業，彼等爲兵工廠技工，養成時間需五年，爲國服務數載，勝利後竟致失業。故在他日救濟工作中，彼等應有優先之權利。</p>
<h3 id="c103">公教人員所得稅將按照底薪課征 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於公敎人員所得稅徵收事，財政部已決定依照三十四年四月十六日公佈之修正稅法，按底薪課稅，唯上海直接稅局尙未接得此項正式命令。</p>
<h3 id="c104">火油價可趨穩定　公司方面防止黑市決直接零售　缺貨之原因由於進口限額過低 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕某大火油公司代表曾發表公開談話：指責目前火油之缺乏，實由於火油限額太低之過。據云現在之火油進口限額，仍以戰前之消費量爲標準，未顧及戰後之新需要。但火油在戰前僅用於點燈，今日則煤炭既屬缺乏，其他之燃料價格又高，故廚房烹飪及冬令取暖，幾無一不用火油，致需要量遠過於戰前，唯有改訂切於實際之新進口限額，方可減輕火油缺乏之現象。且因供需不能平衡，火油之黑市價格已漲至八百元一斤。爲防止黑市交易起見，各石油公司商議結果，決定將以小量石油直接零售於消費者，某大公司於昨日起已成立零售機構，平價供應市民。據茲本市火油存貨充足，惟因煤斤缺乏，火油消費量之需要驟增，致暫時有黑市賣賣，現各公司已採用直接零售之法，中間商人已無法取巧，預計火油價格，短期內當能穩定。</p>
<h3 id="c105">書業昨舉行大會　堅決請免營業稅　推代表廿人再度晉京請願　並討論所利得稅問題 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海全市書業二百八十六家，上月間推派代表十七人，晉京請願，要求財政部免征書業營業稅，當時俞鴻鈞部長曾表示同情，　靜候令遵。不料最近書業公會方面接奉敎育部轉下財政部咨文，只准國定本及審定本敎料書免繳營業稅，其餘書籍仍須一律照征。全市書業聞訊大爲惶惑，羣起　難。公會方面爲愼重計，特於昨日下午二時在貴州路湖社，召集全體會員臨時大會。到全市各書店代表二百餘人，當由李伯嘉·葉溯中。張一渠·徐伯昕·郭農山·周熙和爲主席團，社會局代表對光甲。市商會嚴諤聲。警察局吳祐康列席指導。首由大會主席李伯嘉報告開會原因後，社會局封光甲致詞，表示同情，繼由各同業代表徐啓堂·汪孟鄒·姚蓬子·儲禕·宋良銳·王之澄·蔣振湛等相繼發表意見，僉以書業請求免徵營業稅，實爲符合政府轉助發展文化事業之要旨，敎科書與其他書籍同爲文化工具，敎科書免稅，其他書籍亦應免稅，絕不能歧視，一致主張，派推代表再度赴京請願，同時分電全國同業一致響應，羣起力爭，如不達到目的，上海全市書業，祗有自動停業之一法，情緒異常激烈。當經討論公決，除分電令國同業外，推定徐啓堂·儲褘·汪孟鄒·等二十人，定日赴京，分向行政院·財政部·經濟部·敎育部·直接稅局請願。繼由市商會代表嚴諤聲發表意見，對於書業請求免征營業稅，責爲國家建設文化之正當途徑，上海市參議會業經議決免征在案，最少限度，市政府應尊重參議會決議案，就上海市先行免征書業營業稅百分之七十，中央方面之‘分之三十，應再請中央裁奪，想中央對扶植文化，當不致堅持前議，使晝業趨於消極云云。最後由會員蔣振湛臨時動議，卅四年度所利得稅極不公允，我書業應納全額六千餘萬元，而永祥。兒童。龍門三家，已須繳納三千萬元以上，超過半數，問題嚴重，應請大會予以解決。當時市商會代表嚴諤聲加以剖解，對於調整表示同情，常決議交由公會特組委會討論，予以調整，務求一公允合理之解決辦法，至五時散會。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕敵僞產業處理局，前已奉行政院令，定於本年底結束，上週末蘇浙皖區處理局各辦事處主任應劉攻芸氏之召，在滬舉行會議，商討結束裁併辦法，當時尙未獲得具體決定。將再歸納各方面之書面意見，擬定詳細辦法，呈請行政院批准。據悉：處理局結束後，或將於中央信託局內，成立一「敵僞產業清理處」。處理局內原有人員，將裁遺三分之二至四分之三。遣散人轉業問題，擬酌予介紹其他機關。遺散費，依中央規定爲三個月，逆產處理委員會仍將繼續存在，至於逆產竟移交常地財政機關接管，不無困難，處理局擬再請示行政院。</p>
<p>據中央信託局負責人稱：關於處理局歸併該局事，尚未接奉正式命令，至於究應成立何種機構，負責辦理處理局未了懸案，以及接辦方式究應如何，該局在縝密考慮中。</p>
<p>據一般觀察，認爲處理局歸併入信託局內，組織機構不無困難。因信託局係全國性者，而處理局則係分區制，分區規章頗有不一律者，歸併難免有所不便。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者日前曾隨警局行政處處長方志超參觀華德路警察醫院視察其烟毒調騐工作，並參觀警犬之檢舉挾帶煙土情形。</p>
<p>該院受調騐之烟民約四十餘人，男女參半，多係自動投院之登記烟民，故多數皆已戒絕，且大半臉色紅潤。</p>
<p>該院爲檢舉烟土之挾帶，畜有曾受特殊訓練之警犬兩頭，皆係前日人所遺者，其一名「務培」者，並當塲表現其搜查工作，將備就之烟泡，藏於在塲某記者之內衣袋中，令「務培」檢舉。該警犬即遍咉在場人物，發現後，即對之狂吠不已，並將煙泡自袋中啣出。如是則挾帶煙土者自難逃法網矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲本市肅淸烟毒擴大宣傳週之第一夭，市政府特於昨午四時半，假市府會議室招待本市新聞界。吳市長長因出席宋院長召開之金融會議，由何秘書長德奎代爲主持。首由警察局行政處處長方志超報告本市禁煙工作之概況，分三期進行肅清，現已決定明年一月一日起，將舉行烟民總檢舉，屆時逾期未經調騐者，一律以復吸論罪，處以極刑。</p>
<p>方處長繼報告烟毒調騐所之組織設施，調騐程序，及工作實況。謂該所自本年五月一日成立迄今，總計調騐煙民二八九八人，其中二〇〇六人係自動登記者，八九二名爲經密告後被捕之煙犯。調騐結果：有癮者六〇五人，無癮者二二九三人。</p>
<p>方處長繼謂：自今日起，民政處將發動各保甲進行宣傳工作，敎育局將令各中小學儘量配合禁烟之宣傳，社會局將令飭本市各電影院放映禁煙幻燈片，務期集思廣益，使本年不再如昔日之鳥烟樟氣。</p>
<p>繼由江蘇區中央禁烟特派員劉學海致詞：認爲上海市因情勢特殊，肅清煙毒之推進，恐較他地爲難，此可證諸最近警局發表本年度之自殺數字，八百餘名巾吞服雅片致死者竟佔其半數，此即表示禁烟工作之不够澈底，因而毒物之獲取，如是容易也。劉並特別強調政府對於肅清煙毒之決心，謂「不姑息，不鬆懈，不妥協」。最近吳市長之所以決定增加檢舉煙犯之獎金五千萬元，亦即謀肅清煙毒之貫澈實現。</p>

<p>涵萬古愁　蘊永世樂</p>
<p>昨日，吳氏在滬邸發表了一篇極典雅的書面談話，他說：「吾於方寸之際，常涵萬占之愁，復蘊永世之樂。故在最艱苦中，仍有至慰；而在最快樂時，仍有至憂。自覺此心，已與天主契合無間；對於未屆此等境界之一般同胞，更抱不安。苟有一天，未達天人契合之地步，便有一分遺憾。依予所獲之經騐，恒覺人生之樂趣，實以與天主契合之程度，成正比例。不與天主契合者，爲一切痛苦之淵源；儿與天主契合者，即一切眞樂之源泉。故自家在求　樂，目覩他人仍處痛苦之中，感慨倍深。信仰天主者，即以耶穌之聖心爲心；耶躲之聖心，即物與民胞之襟懹。苟天下有一人一物，不得其所，便覺自己不得其所。蓋信仰宗我者，其快樂之程度，固較尋常爲深；而痛苦之範圍，亦較尋常擴大。信抑宗敎，即背負十字架。抑且「自由」與「服從」二義，木似相反；惟在宗敎生活之中，則融而爲一。因愈能服從天主之意旨者，愈覺自山，一切之不自由，皆因人慾而至。苟能去人慾，存天理，便有「海關從魚躍，天空任島飛」之自由。世界之亂源，實在誤解自由之眞諦。尋常以爲滿足人慾，即是自由；其實人慾愈盛，愈爲三仇之奴隸；三仇者，肉身，世俗，與魔鬼是也。所謂「頂天立地」，必先頂天，方能立地。苟非頂天，託足何所？體念精神生活發展之過程，爲三部曲，一爲不超脫（Attachment），即「隨波逐浪」之謂，二爲超脫（Detachment），即「特立獨行」之謂；三爲從超脫中，仍須胴疴在抱，即「捨已從人」之謂。由第二境，入第三境，爲之最難。此允予所欲與舉世共勉者也了。</p>
<p>冒雨訪問　嘉賓雲集</p>
<p>昨天，記者曾冒雨拜訪吳公使，正好吳公使在午間以私人資格宴李白敎和天主敎許多名流都到了，許多信士都向田主敎下跪頂禮。吳公使藍袍玄掛手裏拿着一枝七八寸長的象牙香烟咀，周旋在嘉賓之間，精神非常愉快。</p>
<p>在吳公使的書齋中，我見到了姚莘農先生。桌子上有一張白紙，墨筆大書「天下一家」四字，是全增設先生的大筆，後面簽着許多來客的名字，作爲臨別的紀念。四壁都是排列得滿滿的書架，法律，宗敎，和文學方面的書最多，綫裝舊籍也着實不少，偶然在庋置得很整齊的整套書上面也還散放着幾本新出的西洋雜誌。如果說從一個人的藏書中可以看出這個人的性格來，那麼從這些藏書中，就可以看出吳氏是何等淵博了。</p>
<p>吳氏一行共十六人</p>
<p>這次吳氏一行共十六人，除吳氏和吳夫人李德蘭女士外，還有十二位是吳氏的男女公子，一位是吳氏的令媳。吳氏今年四十八歲，十八歲結婚，到今年已有男女公子十三人，男九女四，最大的是二十九歲，最小的也已六歲了，這次就是長公子袓霖留滬未去。</p>
<p>我問吳氏，對憲草討論的進展看法怎樣？吳氏想了想說：連日忙於籌備出國的事，所以對討論進行的情形不大淸楚，不過，「我猜測大槪不會經過大修改，可以通過。」</p>
<p>談起了重譯聖經的工作，吳氏告訴我，除掉舊約中「詩篇」的一部份已改譯「聖詠譯義」出版外，新約的初稿也已全部完成，是用文言譯的，他謙虛地說，還想到外國看一點各國論翻譯聖書的著作。此外，別的聖經文學也預備譯一點。</p>
<p>天下月刊復刊不易</p>
<p>我問起了大家都極關心的「天下」月刊。姚莘農先生說，在目前的環境中，要復刊實在不容易。我建議吳公使把他以前發表在「天下」土的許多雋永的散文結集出版，吳氏說：眞的，要蒐集起來倒也有不少篇了，的確可以出一本集子。</p>
<p>從「天下」之不能復刊，我們可以看出上海文化水準之低落。等這木集子出來的時候，也許可以稍慰無數讀者的渴想罷？意大利是一個令人發思古之幽情的美麗的國家，我們深望吳公使在折衝　玷之暇，多給我們讀一點淸麗脫俗的好敢文！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕交通部國際電台，現在每天拍往國外的電報，的有一千六七百你，其中百分之四十是拍往美國的，百分之二十是拍往香港的，百分之十是拍往倫敦的；其餘拍往世界其他各地。因爲機器添置困難，棧路的擴展，也比較遲緩。最近正計劃開闢南美洲路綫，預備和阿根廷及秘魯兩國京城通電。同時已向國外訂購强力發訊機，收訊機，和電傳打字機設備，以增加收發效率。</p>
<p>截至最近爲止，上海國際電台，已經恢復了下利電路！日內瓦，洛杉機，馬尼刺，倫敦，澳門，香港，哥倫布，巴黎，西貢，盤谷，莫斯科，伊爾庫斯克，雪梨孟買等。預計擴展電報電路三十八路，包括亞洲電路十五路，南北美洲電路九路，歐洲電路十路，菲洲及澳洲電路各二路。</p>
<p>國際電臺，也和世界各大電力無綫電臺一樣，採有遙控制度，把中央控制室和發報臺收發臺分設三處。國際電臺的中央控制室，設於沙遜大廈二樓，裝有德國製發報機六副，收報機八副；美國製發報機三副，收報機四副；法國製發報機收報機各一副。發報臺設在真如，佔地約二百五十畝，收報臺設在　行，佔地也約二百五十畝。機器美，英，法，德製都有。</p>
<p>除了電報以外，國際電台還在計劃增設世界廣播，和國際電話，最先預備和美英試話。爲適應國際需要起見，還積極籌備開放中美中英間無綫電傳眞。但結果如何，要看器材和人才了。器材本來恐慌，而人才也爲了待遇太低，（國際電台是按公務員待遇的），往往被其他機構挖去。只有這兩種問題解決，一切計劃才能實現！</p>

<p>華股昨初被後俏，紗花幫先加壓力，證券幫大戶頗多加碼，近午時紗花幫出後急進，軋空忽起，形勢急變，晨開各股均低，受金鈔影饗，浮多咸售，一一一八號八九號七六號二一五號均有壓迫，開後即告不支下游而見低價，三二九號二二四號一四五號一八六號一〇二號一七六號紛購，逐漸拉上，一五二號亦納，十時十分後，乃穿出五〇〇元外，七六號八七號二一八號二二四號逢高有賣，又挫十餘元，形勢不振者甚久，十時三刻，三六號二六號八四號二一八號均售，現永紗曾退至四七〇元光景，後以塲外市價見高，一〇五號一五二號二二六號二三二號七〇號三五號均有納胃，始再穿出五〇〇元大關，一八〇號八五號一四號二八號等急購，一二號三六號亦補，中途雖有回頭，無如檯面極緊，軋空勢成，午刻最爲堅俏，收後喊價績高，較上週六計永紗信和各升一成光景，美亞景福勤興升牛成，華豐升半成弱，新光尙平，冷股永公麗安各跌一成，餘均見挫，遞交美亞以近午缺乏成交，尙現微挫，餘均微升一成弱不等，午後上塲卽俏，經一八〇號一四五號四七號進　水紗，二三三號二一五號進現永紗，再見高價，二號二二四號一一二號二一二號逢高有售，一度回落二十元，此後一度盤旋不定，嗣經二三二號七八號一八五號三一九號二三〇號一九八號等紛進，金鈔大漲，於是現遞永紗信和美亞麗安統益景綸次第宣告漲停，遞信和經過數度掙扎後，亦告漲停，三時十五分後，交易在貼價中進行，大致紗廠由五元至十元，信和二三元，結果較上週六計永紗美亞信和各升成半，景福新光華豐升一成强，勤興好二成，冷股麗安景綸升二成，統益成半，公司火柴中紡升一成，五和稍挫，餘均微升，遞交永紗美亞信和升一成半，新光華豐漲一成，塔外各股再形向榮。</p>

<p>（本報香港航訊）上次通訊中，曾說過靑白足球隊在港出戰，倘欲爭取以後三塲的勝利，必須調整陣綫，十一日出戰軍聯，因爲「借」到了曹秋亭和卓石金兩員驍將，前鋒綫頓見增强，雖因許文奎感冒，未能出塲，卒獲三比一的大捷，聲威頓增。十三日出戰港中精銳的南華，屆時預料更能哄動球迷的世界。</p>
<p>借將戰軍聯青白傳捷報</p>
<p>軍聯全是洋鬼子，一身都是胆，技藝也不壞，前鋒綫十分活躍，靑白若非帶來嚴吳兩將，拱衛大門，勝敗之數，也許改觀，靑白與軍聯出馬人馬是：</p>
<p>（青白隊）</p>
<p>秦必萬　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥　瞿永福　孟義良　高保正　曹秋亭　羅壽福　李養臣　宋靈聖　卓石金</p>

<p>賽程經過：靑自首得順風之利，頻頻進攻，十分鐘後，義臣得機命射，首告中的，（一比〇）。未久，卓石金從右路傳中，羅壽福及時趕到，一脚掃入，（二比〇）此後球來球去，各無所獲，完結上半塲，靑白首佔優勝。</p>
<p>易位再戰，軍聯反得順風位置，戳力反攻，靑白門前，時告驚險，主帥李義臣足傷更劇，實等於十人應戰，心血來潮，立改陣勢，由靈聖打中鋒，石金打右鋒，自己則守右翼。此時爭持劇烈，得未曾有，無何，石金得球盤過兩衛，單刀直搗龍門，果然得心應手，攻陷一城。（三比〇）至將近完塲前五分鐘，軍聯得角球之利，靑白門前陷於混亂狀態，「史狄關」「偷鷄」暗放冷箭，秦必高猛不提防，遂被攻入一球（三比一）。未幾，鳴笛收兵，靑白遂大奏凱歌。</p>
<p>籃球遇勁旅勝南華三分</p>
<p>靑白足球員將，在港出賽兩塲，一敗一勝，敗而不餒，穩紮穩打，勝而不驕，力戰到底，在香港球迷的眼中，已獲相當美滿的印象，明日如能戰勝南華，則更受人歡迎，當無疑義。不過，前鋒綫的不健全，始終是靑白的瑕疵。明日的陳容，勢將又有改變了。</p>
<p>籃球方面，靑白三戰而三勝，十日遇港中勁旅南華，旗鼓相當，靑白僅以三分告捷，靑白的英雄蔡文華，因受對方嚴密監視，僅射得十分而已。（本報特約記者子健）</p>
<p>籃球越熱鬧足球少精彩</p>
<p>〔本報十三日港訊〕這幾天來，靑白在港出戰兩塲，籃球足球各一，雙雙告捷，十三日靑白對南華的足球賽，雖以二對零告勝，擊敗了球王李惠堂所領的雄師，但雙方隊員，不是受傷木愈，就是因事缺塲，踢來毫無精彩，反觀籃球方面，越打越熱鬧，不覺有些失色了。</p>
<p>到了十一日爲止，靑白籃球隊在港，先後與靑年會，黑貓，南華，自力四隊作戰，四戰而四捷。但港中籃球健兒，再接再厲，急起直追，南華之戰，靑白僅勝三分，自力之戰，勝負幾不可分，最後乃以一分之差輸給靑白，球迷連聲呌不值。假如靑白諸子稍有不慎，那麼，籃足球各一塲的壓軸戲，（十五，十六兩日）說不定打成「滑鐵盧」的結局，而抱恨離港哩。</p>
<p>緊張籃球賽一分克自力</p>
<p>先記十一日靑白對自力的籃球戰：自力是本港的冠軍隊，全塲戰氛，眞够緊張，精彩而熱烈。在開賽時，兩方都鎭靜從事，自力用人釘人法打去，竟使蔡文華無所施其技，旋見自力張樹棠犯規，張少卿射不中鵠，不久振暄大發神威？側射中籃，首開紀錄，少卿大而無當，雖有單刀直入之機，却終於籃底失手，射歪不入。再戰聲中，張樹棠一記籃底不入後，卒於捲土重來，一射中鵠，至是靑白喚停，並使陳淸江張毓義入塲替出張少卿與蔡金典，至是即見何立德一記籃底，蔡文華一記遠射，追成四對四平手，但在第一節告終前，振暄又施遠射，造成自力六對四領前之局。</p>
<p>第二節自力有陸德彰趕到，替出潘堯君，在房若山籃底失機後，文華即造成六比六平手，但此後自力聲勢煊赫，連射帶罰，竟造成十六好局勢，直至半塲哨子吹饗前，始見祭文華一記遠射，爲青白多取二分，上半塲，自力以十六比八佔優。</p>
<p>自力干不該萬不該，在下半塲開始時，竟用陳耀寗，雷兆源兩員新登塲，靑白便乘機急起直追，　德彰得中一記後，即一連由陳清江連射帶罰，獲得三分，蔡文華連射三隻，其間雖有陸德彰努力再中一記，然已早被靑白一輪急攻，追成十五對十二比數，自力於是急急呌停，換回房若山與高家和入塲，但其時靑白已氣勢如虹，不可復制，卒被追回廿對廿平手而後，在哨子吹動時，振　正犯規被罰一球，留待第四節施　，完畢第三節。</p>
<p>第四節由陳淸江一射中的後，靑白即以一分初度領前，雖則房若山亦隨後罰回一分，但不久文華又射入一記，此後，自力似有再勝之可能，蓋有仕傑一射，若山一罰，又曾一度以七四對廿三領前，不道在潘堯君罰球不入後，即有馬燦希，張少卿先後各射進一球，成廿七對廿四之比，時振暄抽筋離塲，雖有陸德彰一記遠射追回二分，然時不我與，自力遂終以廿六比廿七，一分之差，飲恨終塲。雙方成績如下：</p>

<p>— 十日訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>把「紹興號」這隻古老的大船挽救起來，不但不再讓它沉下去，而且要使它裝載着紹興人民駛到幸福的領域！</p>
<p>紹典是文物之城。近年的知名人物，如秋瑾·蔡元培·邵力子·魯迅等都是生長在紹典，「江淮河漢思明德，精一危微見道心」的禹陵也是在紹興，太史公「探禹　而登會稽山」，淸吾祖謁陵也要用九拜禮，可見這真是一個不平凡的聖地。顧頡　雖曾以新史學的觀點說「禹是一條虫」，但在一般人的眼光中，禹確是一固忠心爲民服務，受人愛戴的賢君，尤其是禹陵附近數居的姒姓大禹後裔。</p>
<p>浮面的繁榮　裏層的空虛</p>
<p>在物的方面，紹興的「老酒」，淡水魚，平水　，和香糕都是有口皆碑的；甚至在「陰間」（如果有這麼一個世界的話）紹興也是享有盛名的，因爲這裏出產着大量的錫箔，運銷全國。說紹興是文物之那，實在沒有一點誇張。然而如今，紹興城已大不及從前了，它在一天天地衰落下去，紹興稽山中學的校長邵鴻書先生，告訴記者說，「紹興好像一隻大船，現在已經在逐漸沉下去了！平水的茶葉爲了不能出口在整堆的腐爛，黃酒和錫箔都因高利貸和重稅的剝削，抬不起頭來，甚至連「師爺」都退化了，造成師爺的材料—中學生的數量，也逐漸減少了國民的敎育程度難免低下……。」邵先生說到這裏，禁不住搖頭太息</p>
<p>這次我們在杭州的記者，在「浙江省會外勤記者協會」總幹事儲裕生先生的領導下，去訪問紹興。粗粗看來城內仍很繁熒，大街小巷除了稍狹窄之外，在整潔和平坦方面，猶在杭州之上。入夜以後，燈火輝煌，大街兩旁的商店，互爭塲面，「大減價」的布招，隨風飄揚，有幾家還特地搭起彩牌來，上門的顧客也很多。但我問過好幾家店舖，他們營業的總數都不大，每天祗做二三十萬的生意，小本商人的利潤，往往還不够抵二，二角錢的高利貨。最近有七，八家已有十幾年歷炎的老店也被迫關了門。據商會方面推測，新年和春節這二個關口，一定又有很多的商店要關閉了，倒風已吹到紹興，多少老關都在愁眉苦臉望着年關担憂！一個紹興的同業感慨系之地對記者說：「不要看大街上的那副繁華相，他們底內裏都很空虛：繁華祇是浮面，祗是紹興市面的「廻光返照罷了」！</p>
<p>經濟大命脈　箔業陷危機</p>
<p>一般的商業是如此，作爲紹興特產的釀酒業和製箔業也是如此。尤其是製箔工業，似乎已到了危險的末路了。錫箔本米是一種迷信的產物，但是由於佛敎在中國民間的深入，使紹興的錫箔業蓬勃發展，他們從雲南江西等省運來錫料，打成薄片，磨鍍於蕭，峰諾縣所產的鹿鳴紙上，可製錢錠，作燒香祭祀之用。濫觴於明洪武年問，至今已有五百餘年歷史，戰前一年產三百萬塊，大部份均係出口，所以是地方經濟的一火命脈，後來因爲政府嚴格限制迷信工業的發展，產量遂逐漸銳减。抗戰後交通阻礙出路大成問題；勝利迄今，內亂米息，北方銷路仍舊打不開，現在年產祇有幾十萬塊了，不及從前的三百分之一！而且據熟悉紹興商情的人告訴記者說：「如今吾紹香烟的輸出費，已和錫箔的輸人費相抵。」因此，製箔業已不能再成爲紹興地方經濟的命脈了。但是紹興還有二十四萬人口直接間接地賴此謀生’製箔業雖然祇是一種家庭手工業，規模較大的箔舖全縣祇有十數家，但除了一部份婦女視爲副業外，大都是專門按術工人。最近又有一個更火的危機面臨到他們眼前。就是軍人的走私日盛一日。箔稅原來徵額量百分之廿五，在浙江全省的營業稅收中，可佔總收額的百分之六十，可見稅收之豐。現在已改爲貨物稅，劃歸中央，從十月一日起加徵至百分之八十。後來因商民不勝重負，減低稅率至百分之六十。一般遊散軍人，便結集六七人一隊，强用車輛，武裝走私，逃重稅而獲厚利，十一月間更形活躍，貨物稅局不得不請保安司令部派一中隊（三十人）緝私，但他們仍用強暴手段，衝過稅關。他們的理由是：「我們不做流匪已經好了。」面且恐嚇地說：「你們如果開槍攔阻，那麼不但你們自己要流血，紹興城也將完了！」因此主管的袁科長行毅痛心地說：「爲了維護治安，避免爲人利用，祇好忍耐，以至二個多月來，收入總數僅十億餘。照預算年年可有一百二十億的稅收呢！」記者曾到稅關附近去看過，傍晚和黃昏的時候，確有不法軍人押車衝過，一大卡車一大卡車的錫箔就這樣輕輕地偷稅出城，廉價售諸　山，杭州的箔莊，使箔價毫無起色，影響正當商人和廠主，使箔鋪面臨總崩潰的新危機！紹興人口八十二萬，因此將有三分之一的人們，在這新危機中可能全部失業，沒有飯吃。製箔本來是一種迷信工業，它的崩潰並不足惜；但是三分之一的人口失業，將使社會進入多少不安和混亂的狀態，這是最嚴重的問題。而這個問題的關鍵，正和杭州黃包車廢止的關鍵一樣，主要的是轉業問題。杭州黃包車夫大都是綢廠職工，廢止黃包車，就得先恢復綢廠，讓他們回「老家」去。製箔工業事屬迷信，法所必禁，但職工改業，出路大成問題。農村嗎？釀造業嗎？都容納不下，而且也走不大通。最近，紹屬七個有關箔業工會開聯合會議結果，爲了「科學已發展到原子時代了，我們自願跳出迷信工塲。」因此發起改業運動，要求中央在箔稅收入總額下，提撥十分之三，以作箔工改業經費。這在中央的財政收入上固然减少頗多，但爲了加速廢除迷信，解救民生疾苦，這也米始不是一個好辦法呢！</p>
<p>茶爛茶農哭　茶商暗嘆氣</p>
<p>紹興也是平水區的產茶中心，這裏的錄珠茶是曾經暢銷國外的。戰前浙江外銷茶年達廿萬祖，佔全國出口茶三分之一，而以平水茶行銷最暢。區內茶園面積計二十萬餘畝，總產量達廿餘萬祖，可是經過歷年戰爭的摧殘，交通斷絕，農村破壞，產量銳减，及國土重光，茶農茶商重張舊業。奈戰後民生凋敝，資金枯澀，集腋成表，亦無以復興平茶，中農行茶貸雖予廿二億，但因款到過時，成本大漲，美國又限制華茶價格，以致外銷黯淡，徒看日本·印度·錫蘭以低成本茶傾銷國際市塲，而讓綠珠茶在平水區腐爛！各廠今年收購毛茶二七六〇〇担，僅及戰前五分之一；如果本年茶產以三分之一計算，也有四·一四〇〇担留在茶農手中，無法換米！紹興現有茶廠廿四家，今年收購毛茶也不過一萬五千一百担。由於資本短絀，不能製成成品者，亦有大量存在，以致茶農哭，茶葉爛，茶商暗嘆氣！高利貸不但阻塞了茶業，而且也侵蝕了綢業，紹興綢產和杭綢吳綢一樣，爲浙省三個產綢中心之一，如今凋零一如杭州，速電織機都不曾恢復。難怪紹興人見面不再說「哦紹興文章天下第一，」而儘呼：高利貸殺人最該死」了！</p>
<p>縣庫存款多　田賦難征足</p>
<p>政情方面，自林澤長紹興後，據說因爲地方能與政府合作，所以政務推行頗好，財政開支雖然大，縣庫除田賦外，猶存四萬萬元。不過田賦征實，今年還是首决實施。十一月一日起開征，因爲業主收租慢，運輸又不便，而且更重要的是田糧戶籍數達五十三萬，較實際戶數大三倍，許多糧賬無業主可收，現在還收不到二成（全縣賦額八十六萬元，的廿三萬担）如果年底前能收到五成已是十分滿意了，中央限期　足，事實上已不可能。</p>
<p>看紹興報紙像喝白開水</p>
<p>紹興以師爺名，紹興的文化總該很發達，但由於種種社會關係的限制，紹興文化界比省會杭州要差多了。現在紹興有三種日報，縣黨部的「紹興民國日報」和商辦的「紹興新聞」「越報」，都是對開一張。因爲杭州報紙當天上午九時可到，上海報下午三時可到，以致本埠報的銷數都限於二千份左右。但最主要的，是各報都沒有一定的特色。越報的社長說得好：紹興各報由於（一）無一定目標，不能發揮精神上的刺激作用，（二）不敢批評現實，（三）重城區而疏農村，不能深入民間，與民共呼吸。所以看了一張可看第二張，而且即使這一張也「喝白開水」！定期列物僅靑年軍的靑年導報，靑年團的「兒童之友」，縣敎育科的「紹興教育」和「兒童週報」四種，都不是一般的讀物；此外，還有「紹報」等三種定期報，那是小報了，然而銷數有的倒比大報好！低級趣味走紅，固不僅上海爲然也。</p>
<p>傳單與狀子向記者投來</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我想起一件趣劇。當記者訪問團在縣商會剛在休息的時候，突然走進一個軍人，向我們大發「傳單」，由「徐俊」出面，控告青年團强封他所主辦的「覺民舞台」改作「靑年劇塲」，向我們呼籲。這好像從前大官出巡，小民攔轎告狀似的，簡直把我們新聞記者視同法官了，不禁受寵若驚。到了下午，在原地舉行由林縣長主持茶話會的時候，工役又遞進來一張「狀子」，一個呌做「繆慕山」的女子，「謹向諸記者先生呼籲」控告「保三總隊參議徐俊」强佔民房。二件「案子」，把「徐俊」挾在當中，後者分明是個反擊，我們畢竟不是司法官，無法判決，不得不請林縣長解釋。據說：「覺民舞台」係軍官總隊所辦，因爲不付租費，遂由房東轉租給靑年團作靑年劇塲塲址，訂有租的，而靑年團已二次付給「覺民舞台」方面轉租費用二百萬元，此次「徐俊一已爲第三次，如再給二百萬元，仍將有數十個「徐俊」來麻煩，來索屋的言下大有「徐俊」索詐之意。但這種有關軍人的糾紛，連縣長也辦不了，我們記者那能辦呢？然而他們偏都找記者來呼籲，這可見二般人對新聞記者的重視，而足爲我們警惕的，尤其是紹興的同業，他們似乎更應警惕，因爲「紹興像一隻大船，現在已逐漸沉下去了」！身爲紹興人民喉舌的記者們，應該號召紹興的人民，指導紹興的人民，盡他們所能盡的力量，協助政府把「紹興號」這隻古船挽救起來，不但不再使它沉下去，而且要使它能裝載紹興人民駛到幸福的領域！</p>

<h3 id="c194">紹興酒與淡水魚 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 十日訊　本報杭州特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>提起「紹興酒」真是鼎鼎大名。記得在戰時西南天後方，很多外國朋友在痛飲茅台酒的時候，曾經對我說：「將來到你們浙江去，咱們喝紹興酒」，一種嚮往的神情溢於言表。眞的，紹興酒沒有白蘭地，威斯忌的苦味，沒有茅台酒那樣的兇猛，更不是啤酒，那樣飲了多久不會有什麼反應。它的香味很和平，飲起來有些甜味，顏色比葡萄酒淡些，小飲幾杯，薰薰然恰到好處。記者曾在八月二十五日「蕭紹行腳」一文裏曾經約略介紹，但這「紹興酒」的身世實在有詳細一述的必要。</p>
<p>瓶山佳話</p>
<p>春秋的時候，越王勾踐生聚敎訓，越國會有一種佳釀，貢獻給吳國，伍子胥三軍曾痛飲這種佳釀於嘉興嘉善一帶，飲後將空　堆積成山，現尙遺名「瓶山」於禾善兩地，千古傳爲佳話。所以紹酒的歷史，也該將近二千多年了。後來紹興酒漸漸地爲人所欣賞，行銷於江，浙，閩，贛，皖一帶，及至北平都城，朝貢皇帝，紹興老酒名聲益大。在紹興的每一個鄉鎭間，幾都有零星農戶自己釀酒，最大宗釀酒的地方，要算是柯橋，東浦村頭，張瓜瀝一帶。那裏有大的釀坊，空　子堆積得比屋子還高，一大缸一大缸的酒陳列着。據紹興縣商會的理事長陳笛蓀告訴我：「在全盛時代，紹興全縣的釀酒者爭先恐後的製釀着，大概有三十餘萬缸之多。八年前，每一大戶也要釀六七千缸。」每缸可灌十罎酒。糯米一石八斗，可釀酒一缸，一　酒，大槪多爲五十斤。釀造坊附帶產一些燒酒，酒製成後，剩餘的酒糟都可以售之於市，足抵人工和柴火的開支。</p>
<p>成名主因</p>
<p>釀酒的原料，主要者爲糯米，這種糯米不是本地出產的，而來自江蘇的丹陽，金壇，溧陽和本省的嘉興。而紹興鑑湖的水質淳厚，尤爲紹酒成名的主因。</p>
<p>紹酒中名重一時的有所謂狀元紅，加飯，竹葉靑，善釀，花雕等如果把原　埋在地下十年以上，則酒的色，香味更好。江南很多人家在戰前都把紹酒埋貯在地下，若干年後，逢到火事宴客時，就取出開　敬率嘉賓了。在紹興，另有很多大戶人家，在產了女孩以後，就做酒一二缸，封固縝密，埋藏在家人行走必經道路的泥土下，等女兒出嫁的時候，取出　客，有人稱這種酒爲「女兒酒。」</p>
<p>罈空缸破</p>
<p>抗戰時期，紹興酒的外銷停滯，日本人和偽組織套取釀紹酒的方法，在哈爾濱設廠，大量傾銷於華北，東北與南洋各地。在大後方西北西南各地，則有自紹興逃出來的釀酒工人，也打起紹興老酒的旗號，在當地釀紹酒以享渴念和仰慕紹酒的賓客了。抗戰勝利後，日僞在紹興遺留在紹酒方面的殘跡，是破缸空　，零亂堆置。雖然經過很多人努力復興，也不及戰前的十分之一二，據貨物稅局紹興分局的調查，去年僅釀一萬九千數百缸。去年秋收以後，糯米僅賣五千元一石，則一缸酒米的成本僅需九千元，捐稅是以成本征百分之八十計算的。而今年每　的酒價，在三萬元以上，這樣算來，釀造者大可賺一筆，所以今年釀戶特別多，甚至不惜借高利貸來釀酒的。但是今年的糯米價格，每石要在六七萬元以上，再加上人工，柴火捐稅等，酒價一定要提得很高，許多好酒貪杯的人是不是有購買力，還是一個問題。</p>
<p>紹興酒會</p>
<p>現在紹興有很多人，計劃把紹酒遠涉重洋，運往西半球，與外國酒爭一爭短長。但是紹興不適包裝，包裝以後要沉澱，只有用土　子泥粑蓋了原罎外遝，這又似乎太不時代，太不經濟。如果把玻璃瓶子或其他包裝的東西把空氣抽川，內貯紹酒，則埋藏或儲藏若千年後，他的質量不會變好，這又不能與白蘭地等，愈遠年愈好的成績抗衡了。</p>
<p>爲今之計，我想國內各地應該一律用國貨紹酒，再不要月外國來的酒，什麼鷄尾酒會，還不如紹興酒會的好，以使紹興酒能够活躍在中國的市塲上，使紹興酒的釀造者資金靈活；然後再由政府或有資金者以科學的方法，設廠精研，再行銷國外。</p>
<p>范蠡養魚</p>
<p>紹興除了老酒有名外，尙有淡水魚著名全國。春秋時代，越國把吳國打敗了以後，范蠡大夫辭職隱退，便在這紹興的內外河養魚爲生，魚漸漸地暢銷了，范蠡成了豪富，三聚三散，大家稱他爲陶朱公。全縣魚蕩的面積，的在十餘萬畝，當脚划船，或是汽划子經過在內河時，不上一里，便有竹籬爲籪。以往全盛時代，年產可達五六百萬斤，去年的產量，僅五十萬斤，今年好些了，產一百萬斤。</p>
<p>漁業組織</p>
<p>紹興組有漁業運銷合作社，據合作社的負責人談：「因爲漁場漁具大都在戰時捐壞，漁民又受高利貸影響，魚輾轉到顧客的手裏，要加上十多倍的剝削，運銷合作社爲减少這重重剝削，所以從漁民手裏取得的魚，使他能够較直接的送到顧客的手襄。」相反的，有些人在反對漁業運銷合作社，他們說，這個組織是「大司」聯合組織的，所謂「大司」，即是很多漁民羣中的一個漁民首領，代爲辦理運銷事務，這個人不捕魚，也不需勞動，坐享其利。實在並不是漁民。現在合作社要把魚經過他們的組織，每百斤抽十斤稅，有的說抽八斤稅，又有的說抽四五斤稅，總之是要抽稅的。他們認爲這種抽稅就是剝削，所以在醞釀反對中。</p>
<p>培育魚身</p>
<p>紹興雖出淡水魚，但是他的魚秧，却是從江西的九江而運到菱河，再由菱河而到紹興的。現在紹興人也注意到培育魚秧，但魚秧如何培育，選擇那一塊池塘來培育，都沒有想到。我以爲，今天紹興的淡水魚，培育魚秧確是急務，合作社如果光收魚稅，不爲漁民服務，這是不對的。所以政府最好能派漁業按術專家到紹興來，一面研究培育魚秧的適宜地點，一面使漁民眞正獲利，顧客眞正受到實惠。</p>
<p>前途有望</p>
<p>當前紹興地方，普遍流露着一種頹廢與消極的觀念，在他們的四大特產中，錫箔是迷信的用品，遲早要被取消的。平水茶葉外銷無望，自然也沒有辦法。紹酒與淡水魚也呈着衰疲的樣子。我說除了錫箔外，都有辦法的，茶葉，紹酒，淡水魚，都只要加以研究，加以改良，他們都有很好的前途。尤其紹酒與淡水魚兩種，他們都有二千多年的歷史，是越王勾踐生聚敎訓的遺物，我們應該把他好好的加以保護與發展。（十日於紹杭途中）</p>

<p>農田水利工程</p>
<p>本省在戰時興修農田水利工程，以配合農業增產，供應軍糈民食，已具成效，惟以環境困難，經費支細，未能按照計劃實施，或實實施後停頓之處尙多，本年應繼續辦理，期底於成。茲分大型小型兩類，分述如：</p>
<p>大型農田水利工程</p>
<p>（子）臨海桃渚區灌漑工程：該區浚河工程，往年已完成土方卅萬公方，洞港閘亦已局部興工，本年因水利時賦停征，經費無着，工程停頓，經重行設計，將椒北南田兩區工程併列，估計共需經費八億九千五百萬元，已專案呈准中央核撥三億五千萬元，並商准浙閩分署先撥麵粉二四七，五八〇磅，短期內即可復工，完成後受益農田的有十萬餘畝。</p>
<p>（丑）平陽南港區排水工程，該區在平陽鱉江南岸，爲區內十餘萬畝農田排水總水道，因泥沙淤澱，而原有陡門又已失修，以致蓄洩失效，影饗農田生產，卅一年間，先由華北水利委員會駐浙測量隊代爲測量，本年經水利局依其測量成果，重行整理設計，擬先重建水閘三座，佔需經費六億九千萬元，已專案呈准中央列入全國善後救濟基金撥款興辦，工成後受益農田的十萬畝。</p>
<p>（寅）平陽北港區排水工程：擬疏浚渠道，井利用抽水機，已由水利局測設竣事，估需經費六億二千萬元，已與南港區一併呈准中央核撥經費，工成後受益農田的二萬畝。</p>
<p>（卯）衢縣石室堰灌溉工程：該堰應改築閘壩，整治渠道，以利灌溉，並便航遝，業經水利局派員測設竣事，估需工款五億元，已專案呈准中央列入善後救濟基金撥款辦理，工成後受益農田可達十一萬畝。</p>
<p>（辰）永瑞濱海區績建陡門：永嘉，瑞安兩縣濱海濱江區域陡門，曾於三十三年一月先就東山上坪灰橋茅竹三處興工，旋因敵軍流竄停頓，至三十四年七月復工，又因經費無着停頓。本年經水利局選廣化內外雲亭東門灰橋五座，朮佔經費，計需四億零七百六十萬元，內工資部分已商准浙閩分署撥發麵粉三二五，五〇〇磅，以工代賬，已飭八區專署　劃復工，該工程受益農田約十萬餘畝。</p>
<p>（己）衢縣吾平堰灌漑工程：該堰因原進水口易於淤塞，須另開新口，建築水閘，整理總支渠，並建南北分朮槪，曾於三十一年間開工，全部渠道長十二公里土方，已大部完成，以敵竄停頓。本年由局按原計劃重加設計，需款一億四千三百九十萬九千六百七十五元，內工資部份，已商准浙閩分署撥發麵粉一九〇，八九〇磅，以工代賑，經飭縣組織施工機構儘速復工，該工程一經完成，受益農田的六萬畝。</p>
<p>（午）金華湖海塘灌漑工程：該塘如經疏浚，開挖溝渠後，可灌田一萬二千畝，並可利用水位高差，建水力發電廠，發動四百七十四馬力，供應電燈及工業動力，業經初步查勘，估需經費四億二千萬元，現正籌備詳細施測設計。</p>
<p>（未）樂淸萬橋港建閘工程：該項工　先經於二十七年間由縣完成一部份，本年由局計劃續建，估需工款五憶五千七百六十萬元，受益農田的十六萬畝，已向浙閩分署申請工賬辦理。</p>
<p>（申）黃岩永寗江灌漑工程：該項工程，早經測設完成，估需工款十億元，受益農田達二十萬畝。已將計劃發縣籌辦，並代向中央請款，併向浙閩分署請撥物資器材。</p>
<p>（酉）東錢湖灌漑工程：計劃大致核定，擬疏濬築堤修閘，以利灌漑，正由整理委員會籌劃辦理。</p>
<p>小型農田水利工程</p>
<p>本省興辦小型農田水利工程，平原地區着重灌漑排水及圩堤之修復，山區縣份，以挖塘蓄水及修繕閘壩爲主，惟工程畸零，地區遼闊，歷來採省　縣辦方式，以期普遍。本年仍循此方式推行，由局指派技術人員常川駐區巡廻督導，並由省政府通令各縣限九月底以前將本年應辦工程一律查勘，估計，擬具實施計劃，於十一月一日各縣同時興工，利用國民義務勞動，普遍舉辦，其必要經費，估計全省壯丁五百萬人，每人照義務勞動法之規定工作十天，合共五千萬工，每工以一公方，計可做五千萬公方土方。除征收工程受益費或撥借積穀外，並由省洽商山國農民銀行辦理小型農貸。本年上半年，先准中農行總管理處核定貸額一千一百五十萬元，當經分配第一，三，五，區，各一百四十萬元，第二，十一，區各一百二十萬元，第四區一六十萬元，其餘三百三十萬元，視其他各區需要，隨時分配。七月間，復准中農行總管理處貸一億元，並經分配第一，二，十一，區各一千二百萬元，第三，四，五，十，區各一千萬元，六，七，八，九，區各六百萬元。現擬向中農行續貸四憶元，以資協助，正在洽商中。此外井得依照浙閩分署公布小型工賑辦法，申請撥發物資，舉辦工賑，業經申請在案者，查有麗水好溪堰，餘姚庵東築塘，上處整理運河，及開挖水塘，慶元五八都縉雲名山畈松陽城郊，永康城郊等水利工程，及武康修復苕溪鎭，鎭海疏浚河道，溫嶺開　木沙河，德淸築堤浚河，吳興疏浚河道，諸曁建築九里蓄水庫，平陽萬金區浚河，江山修建堤壩，海鹽疏浚南湖，壽昌修治綠荷塘等工程。</p>
<p>水利發電工程</p>
<p>本省河流發源山區，坡陡流急，蘊蓄水力甚豐，如利用之，以建水力廠，實有助於工業建設。過去已辦有成效者，有雲和城郊水電廠，繼起興辦於本年完成者，有遂昌龍潭龍泉城郊兩處，正擬籌辦者，有奉化溪口，龍游靈山鎭，衢縣石室堰，慶元五都八都縉雲名山畈，全華湖海塘，武康思佈堂，平陽南雁蕩，及義烏佛堂等處，水利高局井計劃在錢塘江上游七里隴，建大規模水力廠，苟能實現，可供錢塘江上下游沿江各縣城市電燈及工業用電，功效允大。至於甌江方面，靑田南田百丈　瀑布，亦可利用發電，但上兩項工程，費用浩大，先從事計劃，以俟將來發展，並經商請資源委員會派員協助進行。</p>
<p>歷年水利成績</p>
<p>浙省水利事業，在戰前言　長張局長時代，旱有優良之規模。戰時黃主席伍　長雖在最前綫地方。一面仍積極推進經建工作，而對於農田水利及水力發電工程，復得中農行貸款及技術之帮助，頗著成效，浙江省鐵工廠創製之水力發動機，尤爲優越。沈主席皮廳長涖浙，亦特別注重水利，本市冬季之督飭各區縣大規模發動民工，興修水利交通，仍決定性之政策。到於錢塘江海塘工種局之組設，得工程專專心致力。修復石塘工作，行政院善後救濟總署浙閩分署孫祝兩署長及聯合國總署專家馬歇爾摩爾根梅之熱忱贊助，核撥麵粉一萬三千噸，辦理工賑，中農行技術專員兼局長孫籌培，曁中農行四聯總處主管人員，關心本省水利，貸款額逐步增加，亦爲推進工作之及時良助。至於各區行政督察專之奉令糾設各流域水利參事會，如陳勤士，蔣銘三，竺鳴濤，屈文六，張强，呂公望，均對地方水利事業異常熱心，多方領導，根據原定計劃，權衡輕重，分別緩急，依次典修，現經隨同皮廳長赴京向行政院農林部曁水利委員會薛委員長陳述全部工程計劃，並　薛委員長允撥鉅欽，藉可配合救濟總署工賑物資，把握時間，策進工作，尙望工程界諸先進及地方賢達，隨時協助，則其全部工程即不難逐步實施。</p>

<h3 id="c196">獨身女子處世南針 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 亞伯節譯自雜誌文摘</p>
<p>這篇文字是爲美國女性四個人常中的一個而寫的，這個女子不問她願意不願意，總不會找得着一個丈夫；大槪有四百萬美國女子，年齡在二十至卅五歲之間的，總不會結婚。</p>
<p>可是女子們首先應該明暸這個問題是怎樣來的？</p>
<p>頭一點，男子的死亡率素來就比女子的來得萵。即或在戰前，根據紐約日新聞所搜集的統計數字，美國業已有七十三萬零一百廿九個女子過剩。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，美國死亡了三十八萬個男子，連同至少有四十多萬個退伍軍人帶着精神上或身體上的傷害，使他們不能够結婚。</p>
<p>更加上，每十個男子當中總有一個是頑固的，他堅持地抱着獨身主義，在退伍的軍人當中這個比例恐怕還要高。還有一個因素是許多士兵回來以後，發現他的女朋友年紀大了好幾歲；結果他放棄了她，而和她芳齡十八的妹妹結婚。原來那個女子因而變得沒有丈夫。</p>
<p>她應該住在誰家裏？</p>
<p>對於終身獨身的女子，她應該住在那裏才適當？</p>
<p>許多女子繼續地跟她父母住在一起，直到老年。有的當她父母中間的一人過世以後，而家中有小的弟妹時，她繼續掌握着家政。</p>
<p>有的父母時常靠一個獨身女子所　的菲薄薪資來養家，而她結了婚的兄弟或姊妹雖說有較好的收入，反倒一點沒有輔助。在這樣情形的下，同住的已婚的姊妹如有事外出，還盼望這獨身的姊妹替她照應孩子。</p>
<p>露絲呂德女士告訴我們有一個聰明的獨身女子造了一個爲家庭開支的一預算，呌同住的已婚的兄弟和姊妹共同分担一部分家用，每月由她按期收下。這樣她和全家人的關係維持得非常圓滿。</p>
<p>如果一個獨身女子住在公共的宿舍也會碰到許多困難問題。得不到私下的寗靜，房東的干涉，缺乏安全保障，沒有私人所有權……</p>
<p>大多數的權威贊成獨身女子有她自己個人的家，寗可祇有一間房的公寓，也行。一位曾經任過好幾年的女校舍監說：「常我有了自己的寓所時，最大的快樂就是知道我在夜晩能够得到完全的安息，因爲沒有學生來打擾。」</p>
<p>還有些女子表示愉快的緣故是因爲她有自己的傢具。雖說祇有幾件從她父母家裏搬來的傢具也可聯想到以往的一切情緒。更有些女子本來不喜歡管理家政，可是現在却發現鋪牀燒飯倒很有興趣，因爲這樣可以免得終日無聊。</p>
<p>可是，有許多單獨居住的女子不注意把飯菜弄得好好的。爲什麼獨身女子過了六十歲比起同等年齡出了嫁的女子死亡率來得高？這也是其中原因之一。</p>
<p>有些獨身女子可以說局部地解決了這個問題—她們幾個人打伙住在一起。如果她們的意氣相投，一個聯合家庭的組織是很合理想的方法，因此可以共同担負開支並且成爲良好的伙伴。</p>
<p>羅曼式的情緒怎么辦</p>
<p>羅曼式的戀愛是公認爲婚姻過程中正常的一部份。統計數字告訴我們一個獨身女子年齡過了三十歲很少有機會能够結婚。阿佛龍白乃特在他所著的「婦權運動的基礎」一書中說：須知婚姻是整個時間的事業。它獻給人們一種獲得快樂的機會，可是它並不能保證這個快樂；法庭上的離婚可以證明這一點。</p>
<p>但不結婚的女子私人生活上却遇着一個復雜的情感上的問題。赫伯特，格雷牧師（Kev．Herbert　A．Gray）在他的「男子，女子和上帝」一書中說：「她的命運中包含隱藏的壓力，難以滿足的渴望和不時憂鬱。大約在二十五至三十歲之間，這種憂鬱成爲異常敏銳。」</p>
<p>格雷博士所倡導的是：獨身女子須抱自立的人生哲學，並須立志對於社會成爲有用的人。讓她領會大多數實際上有價値的工作—造成今日文化的工作，好比敎育兒童，看護病人和眼務窮人等都是獨身女子做得到的。所以應該承認獨身女子是社會上極其需要的份子。</p>
<p>更有進者，差不多每一個男子直接地或間接地都受過獨身女子的惠賜；一個年長的姑母或姊妹最初協助他出來立足社會。這是很普通的事情。</p>
<p>如果你不願意在你衰老之年依賴你的親戚或慈善幽體來周濟你，那末，，你應該乘你在賺錢的時候，每月按期抽出一部分作爲儲蓄。</p>
<p>掌握住你的人生之舵</p>
<p>一個女子需要愛別人，也需要人家愛她；可是這不一定是指羅曼式的戀愛。那意思正是指對人服務。格雷博士說：「取愛於人之這莫過於推愛及人。」當人們感受孤獨的痛苦之時，那主要的是內心的寂寞。可是最最無用的却是一個人終日枯坐鬱鬱寡歡等待人家來愛她。那委實是條絕望的道路。</p>
<p>有一個獨身女子利用她空閑的時間到育嬰學校裏去工作，解決了她的煩惱。又有一個顧影自憐的女子潛心潛意沉溺於社會服務之中，也得了快樂。再有一個害羞和畏縮的女子在一個敎堂裏順利地領導一個研究班，也獲得滿足。</p>
<p>有一位JM女士學會了一手精良烹調術，她那「公寓」的聚餐已成爲朋友圈子裏一椿興　濃厚的活動。</p>
<p>麥克D女士養成了一個攝影的嗜好，因此她的寂寞獲得一個解決的辦法。起初，她的一位年長的親戚送了她一隻照像機，於是她參加了一個攝影研究班。現在她自己開了一間照像館，因而獲得加倍的收入。這事業不但是對她極感興趣，而且還藉着它交結了不少意趣相投的朋友。</p>
<p>對於K女士，她的解決方法是旅行。每到夏天她遊歷各種不同的地方，名勝和古蹟，而且在每次旅行中至少要交一位新朋友。</p>
<p>最後還剩下一個問題——就是關於性的衝動。根據醫師的意見，正常的兩性關係應該是每個人生活當中的一部分。然而許多人沒有這種生活還是照樣活着，並且還能够愉快地適應這種環境。</p>
<p>照弗羅衣德指出：完全克慾的危險——把正常的情慾一齊壓制，會產生一種機能性神經病症Neurosis。這自然有不少獨身女子遭遇着的。</p>
<p>對於機能性神經病症的抗毒素是：重新引導性的衝動到另外的途徑，譬如，引導至工作上，研究上或嗜好上等等。弗羅衣德說：『年輕的科學家禁慾的頗不乏人；這些禁慾的科學家能够有更大的精力從事科學研究上的努力。』</p>
<p>獨身女子自然難免不有許多問題，可是她們的問題或許還沒有像她們已婚的姊妹來得多。獨身女子的幸福全靠她把握住自己的舵向有益的方向邁進，獲取自己生命的路綫，投身於工作，嗜好以及自己家庭應處的位置之中。最爲緊要的還是她在其他人們當中有自己的地位。（譯自一九四六年十一月份「雜誌文摘」。）</p>

<p>— 佚名</p>
<p>時屆冬令，人們都以牛乳爲滋補飲料。茲將有關半乳之知識數則，刋載於後，聊供家庭主婦之參考。</p>
<p>牛乳含有鈣和燐的成分，含維他命A和C特多，含維他命B和E亦相常多。</p>
<p>牛乳加熱至攝氏六十三度，的費三十分鐘，病原菌便完全消滅，而牛乳的成分，仍完全不變，與生牛乳一致。若讓它沸騰，其中一切重要營養分如維他侖便捐失去一大部分，因此它的功効也變弱了。</p>
<p>牛乳入腹就凝結成塊，大口嚥下去就凝結成一大團，小口吃下去就成小塊，所以飲牛乳時以慢慢人腹爲宜。因爲小塊比大團容易消化。</p>
<p>牛乳和醋不可同食，否則腹部往往曾起陣陣絞痛，十分難受。</p>
<p>雖消毒過的牛乳，若放置長久，亦會腐敗。檢驗牛乳的簡便方法，使是將乳瓶倒置，若有白色固狀物上昇，即是腐敗了的證據。</p>
<p>牛乳產量，因牛之品種不同，極不一致。最多的一種是霍爾斯泰種；平均每日產乳一斗五升，一年中榨乳日數的有三百日左右。</p>
<p>據最近的統計，一人一年年乳平均消費量，英國人約五斗三升，美國人的一石一斗六升。瑞士人消費亦頗鉅，我國尙無統計。</p>
<p>世界上普遍流行的食品，祇有牛乳一種。在羅馬時代的希臘人，把牛乳認爲是小兒以及證夷之邦的食物。</p>
<h3 id="c199">母愛的重要 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 穎吾</p>
<p>母敎是人生的基本敎育，其力量的偉大，足以完成個人的人格，促進社會的進步，加强民族的發展，提高人類的幸福。在我國社會裏，倫理思想與家庭觀念特別濃厚，父母同爲一家之主，而父親因爲工作上種種牽制，對於家庭往往沒有時間和精力去兼顧。因此，母親實際上成爲家庭中和兒女最親近的人，母親的言語舉動，影響兒女最深。所以母敎的重要，實在是無可否認的。</p>
<p>嘗放母敎一詞的來源，其始蓋出於漢焦延壽撰之易林。易林有云：「失持母敎，佳偶出走。」是爲母敎一詞的濫觴。不過母敎的事實，則古已有之。中國歷史上歌頌優良母範的，眞是書不勝書、如孟母的三遷擇鄰，斷織敎子；陶母的截髪留賓，封鲊責子；歐母的盡荻敎子，柳母的和丸敎子，叔敖母敎子以智，王孫母敎子以忠，莫不彪炳史册，立下千秋的母範。</p>
<p>爲甚麼母敎的力量這樣大呢？因爲兒童自出生之後，與母親的關係最爲密切。母親的哺乳保抱，無不影響兒童，這種影響，便是敎育作用。而嬰兒時期所受的敎育，每每影響終生。所以中外敎育家，談兒童敎育，莫不重視嬰兒期中的敎育，諺云：「敎婦初來，敎子嬰孩。」便是重視嬰兒敎育的意思。兒童心理學家弗羅衣德說：「人類的基本習慣，大都在幼小時建立的。」心理衛生專家懹德博士說：「兒童時期，是實施心理衛生的黃金時期。」由這些地方，皆可以看出嬰兒時期敎育的重要。因爲兒童最易感受外界的刺激，剛出生的嬰兒，好像一張白紙，最初染上顏色，痕跡最深，永遠不易退去。譬如剛出生未久的嬰兒，倘使他哭時，你去抱抱他，或者搖搖他，如此不須一星期，他就非常要你去抱抱搖搖不可了。所以習慣的好壞，都是自小養成的。尤其是小時養成的習慣，終生都要受影饗。英國大博物學家達爾文，他的家庭代代產生傑出的學者，尤其是他的母親，更是有名的賢母，於是有人來向她請敎，敎育兒童應該從甚麼年齡開始，她問道：「現在你的孩子有幾歲？」那人答稱「剛一週半。」達爾文的母乃應聲道：「你的孩子的敎育時機，已經遲誤了一年半了。」</p>
<p>所以兒童的敎育，應該從出生的時候開始，而且一開始就要敎得好。倘若開始敎得不好，後來就不容易敎得好的。從前有位琴師出了一張招生廣告，廣告上說：「未學過琴的學費一元，已經學過的，學費二元。」這便是表示開始沒有敎得好，不但無益，而且是有害的。因此，我們可以說，兒童誕生之日，就是他開始受敎之時。他將來的成就如何，要看他所受的基本敎育如何。母親因爲和兒童的關係密切，尤其是哺乳期中的嬰兒，便時刻離不開母親，所以母親實在是兒童的第一個敎師。就是年齡稍長的兒童，因爲生活的環境和母親接觸機會最多，受着母親的影響也最大。所以，母敎的重要，是誰也不能否認的。</p>

<p>— 白柳</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我怕過漫長的冬夜。</p>
<p>因爲，在失眠的夜裏，我更會感到寒冷與岑寂，雖然是裏在溫暖的被中，並且有別人的鼾聲陪伴。</p>
<p>因而，我在失眠的夜裏，老盼望着樓窓閃爍夜行人的燈火，也盼望着夜行人的足昔—那怕是小偷的光臨。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>被我在鼻樑上　過一拳的人，十年後的今日，是帶着笑容來接我職位的新任。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>我恨極了一張可憎的臉，道張面孔是早些日子在公共汽車上碰到的。我曾默想，此生絕不致有第二副這般可憎的面目爲我邂逅吧·可是，天啦，誰料就是這張臉竟會第二次相値，而且還是在公共汽車上？</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>天下太大嗎？天下太小哩！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>我怕走入任何會塲了。</p>
<p>與這一個人的手相握，又與那一個人的手相握——握過來握過去，總觸不到一雙眞正溫暖的手。</p>
<p>自己不願信口雌黃吧，卻又不耐聽別人的「高論」，因爲總覺得聲音不像是從說話人的內心發出的。</p>
<p>「沒有一個正經人，沒有一句正經話。」缺德的曹禺，你筆下這兩句台詞够我喜愛的。</p>
<p>我不承認我這樣的心情是年華褪色的徵兆，反之，我暗自心喜，因爲求「眞」愛「眞」的心更堅強了。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我感謝一位先生對我說的眞話：</p>
<p>「大名我常見，但老實說，你的大作我却從來沒有讀過一個字。」</p>
<p>許多人不就是這樣成名的嗎？</p>
<p>我懂得「多產作家」其所以要多產的原因了。</p>
<p>我懂得有些人借車新聞紙多登幾次自己大名的原因了。</p>
<p>我懂得……</p>
<p>這世界原來被別人認識的是一個一個名字，而並非一個一個名字所代表的人。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>我坐在一輛急馳的馬車上。</p>
<p>迎面，另一輛急馳而來的馬車，眼望着它爲一部卡車撞上了，可憐的瘦馬仆下，車伕和乘客也都因車幗的折斷而傾跌街心。</p>
<p>我所乘的這輛車上的御者放出了快意的笑。</p>
<p>這不能僅以「同行是寃家」來解釋，「同情」在今日人們心頭已經沒有地位了，這御者不過是一人而已。</p>
<p>那笑聲，使我一想到就打寒　。</p>
<p>無怪我在熱鬧中老會想到寂莫了。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>是的，我老會在熱鬧中想到寂寞。這種心情，如同那——</p>
<p>全塲翩翩起舞後，一段被擲在烟盆中的烟蒂所發出的寄烟；</p>
<p>如同那——</p>
<p>筵席散後，即將散盡的殘餘的酒香；</p>
<p>如同那——</p>
<p>墨黑的夜裏，孤單夜行人的嘆息；</p>
<p>如同那——</p>
<p>失戀者從情塲歸來蹣跚的步履之聲。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>我曾有皈依一種宗敎的念頭，然而這念頭還是念頭而已。現在是，將來一定也是。　原因是對於人生我已經有超乎宗敎徒具有的虔誠了，從現實裏受到的創傷，絕非宗敎裏非現實的語言和假想所能治療的。天堂？天堂裏就找得到溫暖嗎？</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>哭和笑，是人類兩件塡補寂寞的法寳。</p>
<p>然而，笑，並不全具這種功效。因爲笑並不全具眞實的感情呀。虛偽是寂寞的成因，虛偽的笑當然更加重人們心上的寂寞了。</p>
<p>騙子，別露齒而做醜笑吧；如果你想哭，你爲什麼不哭呢？眼水，或者能洗凈了你心上的麼垢，也塡塞了別人心上的空虛。你爲什麼偏要用笑來抑壓着哭呢？</p>

<p>— 惲希</p>
<p>「林先生，進來坐呀！」丁大嫂又立在她家大門口了，並且尖着喉嚨呌。</p>
<p>眞是活該倒霉，三次打從菱塘旁邊這條草徑走過，三次可敎丁大嫂呌魂般呌住了。我停住足，委實有瞟躊踏：應召吧，老八般的陳套話，耳朶裏早起了繭；別轉頭跑吧，又不是十步小孩看見落水鬼，不呌人笑話？</p>
<p>沒法，硬着頭皮，若無其事的踱過去。</p>
<p>「來來，林先生，進來坐，進來坐。」</p>
<p>「不，我想回家去。」</p>
<p>「不要緊，林先生，難得的呵！」</p>
<p>我心裏好笑，半個月中來了兩趟，還算難得？</p>
<p>「不用啦，下回再來吧。」</p>
<p>「不要緊，稍微坐一歇不要緊，來來，進來坐，立着脚酸呵！……」黃瘦的手指平抓緊我的衣袖，不由分說，一把拉了進去。</p>
<p>古老的廳堂，重復用灰黯的翅膀擒住我；發霉的氣味使我惡心。……</p>
<p>捧上紅茶後，第一句話是：</p>
<p>「林先生，你知道，阿賢在外頭過得怎樣？」</p>
<p>我不由的憤然了。是的，我認識丁繼賢，茄子臉，二秒鐘閃一次眼皮，現在上海讀書。然而僅僅如此吧了，我不曾當過他的跟班，不曾受命作包打聽，這樣幾决三番釘牢人問底細，倒像商店夥計討陳年眼，豈非荒唐之至？然而，在這麼怪和氣，怪殷勤的太太面前，有你碰　拍凳，頓足瞪目的餘地嗎？</p>
<p>「唔唔，一我說。</p>
<p>「林先生，我是說，我們的　　在上海怎樣了？」</p>
<p>「他，我不大淸楚，我知道他在什麼中學裏讀書。」</p>
<p>「是了，那就好了。……林先生，我是耳朶根軟，聽了張貴才，就是鎭上錦豐綢緞店的小老闆，林先生你可認得？——他說，我們的繼賢在外頭不規矩呢、。我說，這是什麼話？我們阿賢一直好端端的，有什麼不規矩？……可是呵，話雖這麼說，敎他這麼一講，我心裏可放不下來了。……」</p>
<p>大嫂的牢騷，這回總算連根翻出來了。</p>
<p>「做娘的那一個不是這樣，」我說。</p>
<p>「是呵，林先生，養大個小囡不是椿便當事體呵！我們阿賢已是第三個了，頭上兩個，他的哥哥阿龍阿雲，都不是長不到多太，就活生生的去了。……說起我們阿龍，林先生，我眞是眼淚水流到現在還不曾流乾哪！你想想，這殺胚——她丈夫——生綳綳將他這條小性命嚇掉了，罪孽不罪孽？……林先生，你聽我說，這一夜，我同我們阿龍已經　好了，殺胚喝醉酒回來，聲勢洶洶，又逼着要田契。你想，這麼一點活命資本，我那好隨便給他，就一千個不理，……那曉得呵，他打從廚房裏拿來一把切菜刀，輪到我頭跟前，嚇着要殺我。我想，殺人，你究竟還沒這膽量，也不怕，就說：好，你敢，敢殺我！誰曉得，那菜刀眞的劈下來了，我忙把頭一側，刀砍在枕頭上，擦　耳朶邊，立刻是一攤血。我那時是痛也不曉得痛了，忙着看顧我們阿龍，誰知阿龍早就嚇醒，哇啦哇啦哭起來了。殺胚一腔怒氣發到他頭上，提起刀，儘嚷着要殺小鬼，我抱住阿龍，全身打着抖，阿龍兩個小肩膀也是不住的抖。……」縐摺如風乾　齊的老臉上，熱淚縱橫了。戰慄着手，用大而汚穢的手帕抹拭着，哽咽的接下去：</p>
<p>「就這樣，我們阿能嚇出了毛病，求神吃藥，再也治不好。……」</p>
<p>我歸然，可並不慘傷。——從別人，從大嫂自己，我聽到這故事不止三回了。但無論如何，在這古老的廳堂中，面對這麼一位傷心的老婦，畢竟是難堪之至的事情。——我起身要告辭了。</p>
<p>「不不，林先生，你別要緊走哪，再，再坐一會。……」又拉住我的衣袖，「你，你喝茶呵，你看，茶還不曾喝哩。——呵呀，茶冷了，你看我……昏頭昏腦，換一杯吧。……」</p>
<p>她忙着替我換茶，叫我喝茶，她的感情慢慢平復下來了，重復坐下來後，她開始起勁的掏着夾襖裏邊的袋子，好一曾，謹謹愼愼的端出一個摺皺的信封來。</p>
<p>「你看看，林先生，這是阿賢最近的信，說又要收學費了。……這半年的學費也眞大，一來就是幾十萬。」</p>
<p>我打開信</p>
<p>「母親大人滕下：兒校中近續收第二次學費二十萬元，膳費十五萬元，又兒要零用二十萬元，共計五十五萬元，須在本月月底托便人帶出，至要至要！……」</p>
<p>我奇怪了。大嫂不明明告訴我阿賢已繳過學費二十萬元，怎麼又來第二次？顯然的，這傢伙借着上兩屆老例，扯了個大謊？</p>
<p>「林先生，你說，學費怎麼這樣大呵！廿萬，又是廿萬，從前是沒有這麼大的呵！……怎麼打仗打好了，學費到越發大起來了？……兩隻迷茫的眼睛望住我，彷彿是沒奈何，又彷彿要從我臉上找出解釋。</p>
<p>「這半年學費比起從前來，是漲得特別大，這麼一來，先生的待遇好得多了。」</p>
<p>這麼說着，心底裏立刻感到惶愧了。</p>
<p>「你的話只劉了一半！你不該將兒子的識瞞過母親！」彷彿有這麼一種聲音震饗着，向我警告，咬嚙我的良心，發着痛。</p>
<p>「將底細原原本本告訴她吧。」喃喃的自己對自己說。</p>
<p>「但大嫂是固執的，偏信自己兒子的，張貴才的話她不信，我的話就信了？熱心過份，反惹麻煩，這麼一個嚕嚕囌而復自信的太太，你同他纏得淸嗎？……」</p>
<p>相反的念頭衝上來，吞吃了停在嘴邊的話。——一片熱心頓時冷下來了。</p>
<p>眼光溜過風乾荸齊般的老臉，心裏委實很抱歉。</p>
<p>「學費大，這也不去提牠了。我說我們阿賢也眞可憐見的，說說末住在上海，家裏又沒多錢，學費一繳出，零碎用錢就剩不了幾個，當時寫信來訴苦。……人家不曉得，還道是幾十萬幾十萬的，其實呢，都是正當項子，他又不曾胡吃亂用過。……幸虧來年夏塲裏，聽他說，中學可以畢業了，也總算有了個出頭日子。……」</p>
<p>「汪汪在……汪汪汪汪……」狗聲在門口雜亂的饗。大嫂慌忙拐着脚出去看，隨即回進來。</p>
<p>「野狗眞討厭，老在這裏相打，——我還道是有人客哩。」</p>
<p>「唔唔——」我立起身來要走。</p>
<p>「別要緊哪，林先生，」她跑近我，嘴巴儿乎貼住我的臉，悄聲問：</p>
<p>「林先生，你知道，我們阿賢在上海有沒有相好的女人？……怎麼替他說親，他老是說慢慢兒呢？……是怎麼一個，迷人精呀？林先生，你只管說，我不生氣。……」</p>
<p>「這個，我的確不曉得。」</p>
<p>「噢噢，你不曉得，我也是猜想，猜想，……林先生，你到上海，替我打聽打聽。……咳咳，你告訴他，有要好的，也同我商量商量，別儘同娘嘔氣呵！……</p>
<p>「是是」我答應着，一脚跨出門口。</p>
<p>「林先生，你幾時到上海？臨去時我這裏彎一彎，我有事拜托你。……」大嫂的枯澀的喉音在我背後響。</p>
<p>我走着路，我的而前映出一片模模糊糊的景象。我彷彿看到大嫂拐着脚，爬着山路，她勇敢的爬上「丈夫」那一座山頭；一霎眼開，她失足掉落下來了。——跌的多麼重，多麼深呵！然後她舔着滿身瘡痍，鼓足勇氣，向另一個山頭爬去。這山頭上鐫着「兒子」兩字。她喘着，顚躓着，踏着崎嶇的石塊，榛蕪的荊棘爬上去，心裏滿有把握的，她看到閃爍的光輝，在模糊的老眼前映現了。……她確信着，不多久，這模糊的光輝將亮在她的眼前，她切實能將它抓住。……</p>
<p>然而，那山頭已開始掀動，且將崩坍下來。……</p>
<p>這結果你自然可以料到。…</p>

<p>瘦西湖上的遊船，以筆者記憶所及，似乎隨着時代的演變愈縮愈小了。大的畫舫，在從前是可以擺酒席的，主客以外，加上船夫，僕役和廚師不算，更有侑酒奏曲的粉白黛綠之輩。這麼，畫舫自然是要很大的，兩舷有離欄，上面有飛蓋，裏面還有許多陳設。這種畫舫在現時已是見不到了，現時所能見到的比較要小得多，佈置等等，也遠不如前。並且就是這比較小的畫舫，也像失去了靑春，露出衰老的情態，早不受到遊客的埀靑，三五零星的幾艘，却在靜候着舉家老幼一同出遊的人們去光顧了。</p>
<p>近多年來湖上的船隻，來來去去的多是極小的一種，俗稱小划子。這小划子上面有潔白的布憲，四面用鐵條支撑着。裘面放着幾張籘躺椅，並且也有一張小木桌，可以放放茶具。如是只三四人合坐一船是很舒服的。船身小，速度快，遊湖時轉動靈活，自會爲一般人所愛好。</p>
<p>不過大的畫舫，隨着時代演進，歸於淘汰，小划子應運而生，這固是瘦西湖上近多年來最顯著的轉變，可是以筆者的觀察，戰前與戰後，却另有一種使人發生滄桑之感的，便是一些撑小划子的船孃也變了。戰前的船孃在服裝方面，似乎有一定的，多是黑色的綢褲，白色的布衫。這樣的裝束，襯映在綠沉沉的草木中，正是湖上不易見到的忘機鷗鶯，自很賞心悅目。並且多在妙齡，不少眉目娟秀的，在「知好色，則慕少艾』的情祝下，她們在湖上撑船的生涯，不用說會比其餘村俗的船夫們要隆盛得多。加之她們撑船的技術又很好，拿着一支竹篙，很靈活的撑去，不管多遠，篙子一上一下，衣服上不會濺到水點子，那種靈活的身軀，嫻熟的技巧，像音樂之有節拍一樣，如是你躺在籘椅上帶着鑒賞的心情看去，會不出的暗自贊美。</p>
<p>年靑的人們總是好動並且好勝的，見到船孃們善於撑船，也便欣然學習，會呌船孃們坐在船裏，由他們去撑。船孃們看着他們有時爲了篙子拿不好，使得小划于在湖裘迴旋着，或者撑得欠缺技巧，拔起篙子，把湖水濺得滿身，會格格的笑成一團·在這邊的柳陰中，在那邊的蘆葦旁，此起彼應的笑聲，常是連綴成一串，然後慢慢的低微下去，終於沉沒在湖風裏。這眞是湖上極美妙的點綴。可惜眉目娟秀的船孃，如今已不多見，服裝方面，也沒過去那麼整潔，就連撐船的技巧，也似乎沒過去那麼嫻熟了·這是戰爭帶來的災害，衰老的揚州，却再也經受不起這樣探災害哩！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>萍子啜泣了一會，背着鶴見，掏出手絹來，把眼淚擦乾了，突地又轉過身來，仰着臉瞧着鶴見，勉强放出笑容：</p>
<p>「大哥，失禮得很，像我這樣哭笑不常，更要呌你憎惡的……但是我自己也莫明其妙，爲什麼忽然悲感起來。」萍子說着，看見鶴見一臉惶恐的樣子，不覺也有些悵惘；雖然微微強笑着，眼角又湧出了兩顆大淚珠，映着月光，亮晶晶地。「大哥你的意志堅强的程度，超過了我的集中力；我沒有本領，探索你的心事。」她承認失敗了。</p>
<p>「萍子，請你不要怪我粗魯，你那張小紙　，究竟寫了些什麼？」鶴見要探明這個女子，對他究竟忠實到什麼程度，「，　張祇已被近衛老頭兒拿去了。」</p>
<p>萍子聽了，有些忸怩起來，好半響，着見　見仍舊等着　答覆便低下了頭，「那是我的心事，所以不願呌人家　見……那是我最喜讀的一隻小詞，把上面兩句改了幾個字—一共十四個字，是……」</p>
<p>鶴見很不願意她把這十四個字說出來，但她仍舊含着一臉羞澀的微笑，把那兩句話念了出來，並且念了兩遍。對於萍子的忠實，用不着懹疑了。然而這時鶴見白已心上，起了兩種意念的鬥爭—爲了祖國，他可不擇手段，就是奪假愛情來驅這女子與自己合作，也不算缺德；爲了祖國，是應當犧牲一切的。但從另一方面說，不擇手段的方式，也應有一個範圍，這範圍邊際接壤的所在，大概應當是人格的領域。自己堂堂一個男子，雖說不擇手段，却不應當觸犯人格的領械。</p>
<p>他沉吟了一會，決定利用萍子來合作，却不愚弄她，以維持自己人格的尊嚴。</p>
<p>「萍子，我有一句話，現在不能不說：我們能不能把公與私的界限，劃分　淸楚一點？換句話，我們在　務上不談愛情；在私事上，不牽涉職務？」</p>
<p>萍子聽到這突如其來的提議，首先好像陷入了一陣惶感之巾，似乎不明白鶴見的命意。繼而覺得鶴見是在試探她，要看她的愛情，究竟是否堅定，永恒。但再深人一步，又覺得鶴見是在向她挑戰，因爲她固然不深切明瞭鶴見的政治立塲，鶴見也不見得了解她扛着什麼旗幟。她怔怔地瞧着鶴見，出神了好一會：</p>
<p>「請你再說得淺明一點，讓我懂得透澈一些」。</p>
<p>「這是很叫顯的，我不値得抓住你的弱點，來愚弄你，來利用你！」鶴見雖然聲音很輕一細，很低沉，然遭萍子的耳鼓土，却如同霹靂那般剛硬猛烈，「我記得你說過，令尊他們認爲我走錯了路；　又說你說不叫白。現在我很想知道他們的眞正立塲。這是一點。第二點，我還想知道請木長老對於現局的意　。第三點，我更願意明瞭你個人的意見—關於火局的！……但是慚愧得很，不到相當成熟的時期，我不能對　說明我的眞目的。在不能說明之前，我不願愚　你，我要維訶我的人格！」</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>看了聯合社關於美海軍南極探險的報道，也許令我們會產生一種感覺罷，人的生命價值，有的是光輝燦爛，有的陪然無色，那是一種何等懸殊呀！</p>
<p>生命代表希望，有生命希望無窮，可是這個道理，對任何人都適用，祇是所謂希望之價値，須作種種不同的佔定而已。</p>
<p>駛赴小美利堅途中的奧林匹斯小艦上所發出的電訊稱：</p>
<p>美國海軍南極探險隊所屬濟艇『桑奈特』號，將於抵達南極時，潛入冰下，向羅斯海面之冰層開砲，並施放魚雷兩枚，以視有何結果。據潛艇艇長愛森荷威稱：塊冰不致受何損害。潛艇上軍官十人，船員七十人，均係自願參加此次探險，在海面下航行路程之長，氣候之冷，風濤之險，將以『桑奈特』號潛艇所經歷者爲最。</p>
<p>這些人都不是傻瓜，爲什麼甘願如此冒險，難道眞是活得不耐煩了嗎？這些人並不是傻瓜，正相反地，他們却是天地間第一等聰明人。他們將個人的生命不惜作爲『多數人生命』的資本。人類的文明，進步，又怎麼缺少像這般傻瓜的人呢？</p>
<p>其次，我們想到美國的海軍，在此次世界大戰中，在大西洋，地中海，尤其在太平洋上，發揮了它們作戰的威力，但一旦戰爭結束，他們却從事於這種科學的工作，爲學術界盡力，這種現象，使我們曾了悟到戰爭與和平力量的不可分，打破了純軍事的偏狹觀念；同時也在說明了基於國防立塲，軍事上的裝備，同樣可以從事其它種種的活動，對於國家民族以至世界能有貢獻的。</p>
<p>尋找困難，克服困難，爲安全，幸福，人的活動是無窮盡的，但爲了自己或自己的一個小圈圈，那根本就無價値可言了。</p>

<p>乞丐的風趣</p>
<p>一個衣衫褴褸的流浪者，在紐約，拉住了一個衣冠楚楚的人，說，『先生，可不可給我一角錢。我已飢餓得將要死了。』那人給了他一角錢後，忍不住說，『我怕你一角錢在現在這個時世，是買不到食物的。』</p>
<p>『那並不是討了來買食物的。』那流浪者說，『我已經八天沒有吃過一點東西了。我想用這枚角子在磅秤上，把自己秤一秤看。」</p>
<p>戰爭的發生</p>
<p>『爸，』一個十歲的孩子問，『戰爭是　樣發生的呀？』</p>
<p>『啊，孩子，』爸說，『讓我告訴你，舉個例來說，譬如美國和英國爭吵了——』</p>
<p>『美國是沒有在和英國爭吵呀，』媽打斷了爸的話，說。</p>
<p>『誰說他們在爭吵呀？』爸顯然是憤怒地說：『我祇不過用假設的譬喩來給孩子舉個例罷了。』</p>
<p>『豈有此理，』媽咆哮着說：『你總是把一切錯誤的思想灌轍到他的腦中去。』</p>
<p>『有什麼豈有此理呀？』爸也聲勢洶洶地說，『假使他聽了你的話，他的腦中就永遠不會有思想了。』</p>
<p>爭吵越來越激烈了。正在難解難分之際，那兒子開口說話了。『媽，謝謝你，爸，謝謝你。現在我已經完全懂得戰爭是怎樣發生的了！』</p>
<p>筆的呼聲</p>
<p>房裏嚴厲地對着他將搬進的房客說：『我必須再通知你一聲。我不願意在你房中聽到孩子的聲音，狗聲，貓聲，鸚鵡聲，或是任何動物的聲音。不許彈琴，不許聽無綫電。都知道了嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的，』房客懦怯地說，『但是，你應該知道的，我的筆有時候，也常常嗤嗤地作聲的呀！」</p>
<p>出人意料</p>
<p>一個駐紮在德國的美國士兵，收到了他的女情人的一封電報。這電報簡直是應該在「最短最短的短故事」中得一個獎的。這電報上這樣的寫着，『等你不及了，所以已和你的爸結婚了。愛着你的媽！』</p>

<h3 id="c208">叫化子的組織17 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>北派丐幫在上海</p>
<p>在上海市上，除了本地丐帮之外，還有幾種呌化帮。其中以「硬採帮」組織最爲嚴密，而歷史尤爲悠久，絕啡半路出家的本地丐帮可與比擬。「硬採帮」丐　久遠，他是屬於全國性的叫化正　。在前清年間，該帮正值發揚光大之秋，丐徒足跡遍及大江南北，以至遙遠疆域。因爲在淸季歷代的朝廷。都曾頒佈「聖旨」，封有丐頭”特許該帮「逢門可丐」。而且「逢門可乞」。而且「逢城設廠」，『逢鎭設甲』，氣派自非恒流。我門所熟知的各地都設有「丐廠』，或俗稱「乞丐營』，便是屬於「硬採帮」的派系。</p>
<p>上海是近百年來發跡的一個大城市，又是位於富裕的東南區域，自然「硬採帮」決不會忽略這個肥缺的。上海之設有丐廠，已在淸朝中葉的年間，其經過雖非筆者所可知，但我們祇要略加留意，便可以見到「硬採帮」丐流的踪跡，在本埠仍舊隨處可見，便可以想像到其勢力仍舊是不可侮的。</p>
<p>「硬採帮」是由北方流佈而來江南的，只要一聽他們的言語，總帶着黃河以北的腔調。可知這該帮是沒有江南人混在裏面的。丐頭又稱「甲頭」，每一丐廠祇有一個。在從前，他有絕對統轄全滬乞丐的　　；因爲依照該丐帮的傳統，丐頭例有「生殺予奪」之權。該帮階級甚嚴，規律又極爲公正。在前淸，凡非「受訓」過的丐流，休想在本埠乞討。就是從外地來的乞丐，也得專　前往拜過丐頭，名爲「拜碼頭」，方可在本埠從事乞討；否則連安身之處也要發生問題了。即使是已有積蓄，不想在本埠乞討了，仍舊得「拜碼頭」。這是江湖上尊長敬老的一種嚴格的通例。</p>
<p>讀者要知道那些乞丐是屬於「硬採帮」的，那並不是難事。祇要看下列的門類，便可以從記憶中得到實據了。「硬採」兩字命名的意義，便是「强呌化」之謂。你給他錢，他謝也不謝便走了。不給他錢，他決不肯空手離去的。不是長期抵抗，便是賣弄技藝，或是大唱呌化歌；再不給，便要在你大門口鬧出血案來了。名爲「掛彩」，可是他決不敢割破你的皮肉，而是割破他自已的皮肉，流出他自已的鮮血，使血肉糢糊，而擴大事態。這時你不得不給資遺散他們了，可是他們這時却仍舊不肯走開，至少要給十倍以上的錢才肯走。這便是我們向來所　的「惡丐」。他們都有一兩樣特別的表演技能，分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）「　　架子」—把一根短竹　，頂鼻尖上，　的上端，放着碗盤之類，能够持久不下　。</p>
<p>（二）『蓮花落」—手敲竹板，口裏唱着小调；音節和諧，歌長而不重複。</p>
<p>（三）「聲靑龍」背負一竹　，內貯幾條靑蛇。手裏總拿着一條蛇玩弄着。</p>
<p>（四）「雙　鑽洞」—拿一根鐵鈞，把鼻岸和喉嚨各穿鑽一洞。</p>
<p>（五）「打磚呌街」—用磚敲胸，沿街呼呌，以敲胸爲拍節，與呼聲相應和。</p>
<p>（六）「點鳳顯」—在印堂中插上一根組針，針端頂住一隻碗，隨排隨唱着歌兒。</p>
<p>他們演藝之後如不得錢，便從彩袋裏拿出一根竹筒簫，嗚嗚咽咽的吹奏起來，作爲最後的警告。再不得錢，便拿出一把小尖刀，在額頭上一劃，於是滿面流着鮮血起來了。他們每次乞討都以二三人爲一小組，以便互相照應。</p>

<p>— 風波</p>
<p>抗戰期間，祗要在重慶住過的人，總會知道這位褚老先生在參政會上的厲害。他和黃炎培·孔庚等同樣的會批評人，或有過之而無不及。勝利前，爲了調解國共的糾紛，曾與左舜生莫德惠等，飛赴延安，從事調解。雖然到今天，調解還沒有什麼成功，但和平之門一天不閉，總還有一錢希望。</p>
<p>在北伐前後，他奔走革命，供獻出極大的力量。在黨國歷史上是位顯赫的功臣。褚先生又樂於辦敎育，民國十五年和于右任·王寵惠等創辦法科大學。八年長期抗戰，先生在四川萬縣又辦了一個上海法學院分院。勝利後，正式改名爲輔成學院，以資紀念。</p>
<p>現在褚先生仍任上海法學院院長之職</p>
<p>褚轉成先生又名慧佾，浙江嘉興人，自奉儉約，生活樸素。老是穿上一件藍布長衫，布鞋。下雨天最多穿一雙橡皮鞋。矮矮的身材，走起路來，已有些幌。瘦瘦的臉，帶上一付眼鏡。滿額縐紋，更顯出是一個久經風霜的學者風度。</p>
<p>這次開國民大會，他是主張延期的，希望國共和平談判成功，共謀國事。所以，他這次是遲到，於上月卅日開五次會議前，才補行宣誓。他以社會賢達代表的炎格，出席國火將來定有很多的供獻。</p>
<h3 id="c210">「剝老頭」 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 予峰</p>
<p>昨晚九時餘，我被一個朋友拖住吃飯，談了一回天之後，爲了急於回家，就一路抄着小路走。灣入英華街時，沿路的商店大部都已打了烊，行人之寥寥落落的沒幾人，只看見對面人行這上有一個流氓模樣的人，緊釘着一個五六十歲的老兒，說着一口不三不四的話，我以爲大概總不外乎是兜攬他去看「春宮」，「磨鏡子」等淫靡的玩意。起先釘了一陣倒還沒有什麼，那老兒一步快一步的意圖躱避這人的煩擾，但是這流氓見沒有回音，卻更緊追不放，一面還不住地嘰咕着那套下流話。看來道老兒實在忍不住了，回過頭來，怒目的對着這流氓，手指戰抖地指着，破口罵了起來：</p>
<p>「你應該看人頭……你緊釘我做啥？——　三！」</p>
<p>那個流氓有些不服貼，開口就齷襄齷齪的大罵起來，幾乎要動武。這時斜刺裏走出三個穿得還像樣的漢子來，做好做歹的勸着，拉拉扯扯的擠着擠着，不由那老兒做主，就推人了精美酒家隔壁的一條黝黑無光的小弄裏！我看了不由得就奇怪起來。於是放慢了脚步，遠遠地望着對面，但微弱的路燈光芒下也看不淸什麼。雖然心裏是那末的狐疑着這怪劇的發展。</p>
<p>我從對面穿到了這面來，後邊卻有幾個人邊走邊高聲的談論着；仔細一聽，正是關於剛才那幕怪劇的下文。其中的一個說：</p>
<p>「這班　三也　越來越無法無天了，——算那個老頭兒又遭了殃。」</p>
<p>「我看那老兒的傷可不輕哪！不知怎麼會給他們　到這小弄裏去的……唉！打了不算，還把大衣及滿身的衣服給剝了！」另一個似乎有點感慨。</p>
<p>「以後這條路倒要小心點吶！……」</p>
<p>再下面我因爲沒有聽的必要而加快了脚步。</p>
<p>我覺得這般犯法者的手段越弄越高明起來，竟然可以從容的把人弄到了陰僻的地方下手。而他們每被警務當局捕捉了一次，放出後非但不知改悔，却反增加了他們的經騐，使手段的運用更精密起來，各種的計劃也層出不窮，讓人們隨時隨地都有上這圈套的可能。現在時值多令警務機關對宵小的防止，似乎是應該更嚴密些了！</p>

<p>關於「標會」的存廢問題，最近頗多議論，但是否取締得了，那是事實問題；這里僅僅談談它的近况。</p>
<p>「標會」這各詞，以前僅僅流行在非智識份子的中下階層裏，因爲超越尋常的會息，確乎有形成高利貸的嫌疑，不但爲有識者不齒，而會的本身也不容易健全，可說十九是中途夭折的。</p>
<p>現在的工商界，受到高利貸和捐稅的內煎外逼，多數在風雨　搖之中，金融界方面和其他的債權人，像州司臨門般逼着討債，那殺人不見血的高利貸會把母金本身漫無止境的膨脹下去，幾十幾百萬一天的拆息，竟使一家普通廠家或商店的生產力越追越遠，走近了崩潰的前夕。</p>
<p>工商界也明知標會是欲鳩止渴，但是，債已無可再舉了，本身的商業，還想竭力撐持，剜肉補瘡，亦非得已。</p>
<p>小型的標會，有小至三五萬元的，同樣很盛行在廠工店夥羣裏，這些具體而微的組織，意義和前者略同，不外乎在某種急　的情形下，與其作高利貸的嘗試，不如以「標」治標，到現在，標會在商人心目中，無異一種應酬文章，往往一個人擔任了十幾處會脚，並且爲求獲得義務上的取償，也如法泡製的做了一次會首。</p>

<p>因爲猪肉價昂，來源不暢，所以市郊已有狗肉出售。二千元買一斤，無論如何比豬肉總便宜。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman's Instructions on Constitutional Principles: Considering the Overall Situation, Major Changes Should Be Avoided; Hope to Conclude the Assembly Within This Week <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] At 12:30 PM on the 16th, Chairman Chiang invited representatives of the Kuomintang attending the comprehensive committee to lunch. He repeatedly urged them to consider the overall situation and avoid making major changes to the original draft constitution. He also expressed the hope that the assembly would conclude within the week. It is widely believed that the comprehensive review of the draft constitution will proceed smoothly thereafter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The central memorial week was held at the National Government at 8:30 AM on the 16th. Representatives of the Kuomintang National Assembly were again invited to participate. Chairman Chiang personally led the ceremony and delivered a speech, stating in brief that the National Assembly had been in session for four weeks, and this was the final week. This stage is the most crucial juncture for the constitutional drafting work. He hoped that the representatives of the Kuomintang would clearly understand the current world trends and the domestic situation, discern the advantages and disadvantages, and mutually advise each other. He also urged them not to change the important principles of the draft constitution proposed by the government and to jointly complete the constitutional mission.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] It is reported that some Kuomintang representatives have held several meetings in recent days and drafted sixteen articles of amendment to the draft constitution. The spirit of these articles is still based on the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and incorporates the opinions of various parties. These opinions were presented to the Chairman during lunch on the 16th and were deemed feasible by the Chairman.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The review of the draft constitution proceeded extremely smoothly on the 16th. A meeting of the conveners of the comprehensive review committee will be held at 10:00 AM on the 17th to discuss the organization and personnel of the sorting group. The fourth comprehensive review committee meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The meeting of the conveners of the comprehensive review committee was held at 10:00 AM on the 16th, chaired by Chen Qitian. The important decisions are as follows:</p>
<p>A. The scope of review by the comprehensive committee hereafter: (1) those that the minority party strongly opposes as a result of each review committee; (2) those that the government deems unenforceable as a result of each review committee; (3) those that have conflicting results from the two review groups; (4) those that have not been decided by the review committee and are submitted to the comprehensive review committee for decision; (5) those in which the comprehensive committee has adopted the opinion of a certain review committee, but the related articles must be amended accordingly.</p>
<p>B. A sorting group shall be established by the comprehensive committee, composed of the conveners of the comprehensive committee and the chief conveners of each review group, and experts may be invited to participate. Its tasks are: (1) to study the results of the review committees according to the above scope; (2) to propose preliminary solutions; (3) to preliminarily sort out the text.</p>
<p>C. After summarizing the review opinions of each group, the original fourteen issues have now been merged into eleven issues in order to simplify them.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The Kuomintang National Assembly representatives' opinions on revising the draft constitution are as follows: (1) Article 1 of the general principles should maintain the original draft and not be amended to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." (2) Article 4, regarding the issue of territorial changes, should be changed to "No changes may be made without a resolution of the National Assembly." (3) The issue of the national capital should maintain the original draft, designating Nanjing as the capital. (4) Regarding the organization and powers of the National Assembly: A. Organization: 1. Members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan should not be ex officio representatives of the National Assembly; 2. Increase the number of representatives from professional organizations and women; B. Powers: Add the power to amend the constitution. (5) The National Assembly should be convened by the President, but the provisional meetings convened regarding Article 30, Paragraph 1 (i.e., impeachment of the President and Vice President) should still be convened by the President of the Legislative Yuan. (6) Regarding the powers of the President, the phrase "emergency events" should not be added to Article 44. (7) The Legislative Yuan's approval should maintain the original draft, i.e., Article 57, in which "When the President of the Executive Yuan resigns or is vacant, the President may temporarily appoint a person to act in his place" should be changed to "may appoint the Vice President to act in his place." (8) Members of the Legislative Yuan should be elected by universal suffrage, the Judicial Yuan should remain the same, the Ministry of Judicial Administration should belong to the Executive Yuan, and the Examination Yuan should remain the same. (9) The Control Yuan's power of consent should remain the same, and members of the Control Yuan should be elected by the provinces. (10) The power of final audit should belong to the Control Yuan, and after the audit is approved by the Control Yuan, it should be reported to the Legislative Yuan. (11) Increase the number of representatives from border ethnic groups and add clauses to the chapter on basic national policies regarding the development of the economy and education in the border areas. (12) Stipulate a representative ratio for women. (13) The issue of central-local powers should maintain the original draft. (14) The provisions for counties should be appropriately supplemented. (15) Basic national policies do not need to be divided into chapters, but the articles can be added or deleted. (16) After the constitution is promulgated, the transitional provisions should be determined by a resolution of the constitutional National Assembly. (17) The following points should be eliminated as much as possible: 1. weakening the rights of the people; 2. increasing executive power; 3. violating the principles of the Political Consultative Conference; 4. creating ethnic division.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Comprehensive Review Committee Passes Resolution for President to Convene National Assembly; Discussions on the Powers of the Legislative Yuan Still Yield No Results <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The Comprehensive Review Committee held its third meeting at 3:30 PM on the 16th, with 155 representatives present, chaired by Chen Cheng. First, the report of the Presidium meeting was given, presenting the matters decided by the conveners' meeting as follows: (1) the scope of review of the Comprehensive Committee, (2) the organization of the sorting group, (3) from this meeting onwards, proceed according to the agenda issued by the Secretariat, and for speeches on the same topic, each person is limited to two speeches, each speech limited to five minutes. After the report, there were slight objections, and it was quickly passed by a majority vote. The chairman then announced the discussion of eight items: (1) the powers of the National Assembly, (2) the convening of the National Assembly, (3) the issue of people's public service, (4) the issue of chapters and sections in Chapter Four, (5) the issue of emergency events, (6) the issue of the powers of the Legislative Yuan, (7) the issue of the number of members of the Legislative Yuan, (8) the issue of auditing power. The discussion is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Powers of the National Assembly</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of the powers of the National Assembly, the chairman reported that the issue of the number of minority representatives had not yet been fully studied and would not be discussed for the time being. Subsequently, a majority of the representatives spoke. Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party stated first: that he could not agree with some of the amendments to the draft constitution, such as the original draft stating that members of the Legislative Yuan were elected by the people and members of the Control Yuan were elected by the provincial assemblies, but now they have all been changed to elections by the National Assembly, which he could not agree to. The presidents of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan should also not be elected by the National Assembly, because these are specialized talents, and the president of the Examination Yuan should be nominated by the President, not elected or impeached by the National Assembly. Electing members of the Legislative Yuan is a direct democratic right and should be directly elected by the people, and the original draft should be maintained. Democratic Socialist Party representative Zhu Hongru stated: that after the amendments to the draft constitution, the powers of the National Assembly are too great, almost overturning all the principles of the draft constitution. There are currently two types of democratic systems in the world: one is the representative system, and the other is the direct democratic system. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the latter. Now that the National Assembly is placed above the five Yuans, how can democratic rights be exercised, which is quite problematic? The National Assembly has violated the principles of direct democracy. The term of office for representatives of the National Assembly is six years, and the National Assembly meets once every two years. Who exercises political power during the recess? With the National Assembly placed above the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan has clearly become indirect and even more indirect democratic rights. The Examination and Judicial Yuans should increase their non-partisanship, and the President should select and appoint talented individuals. If there is no amendment, then this National Assembly will become a constitution of one power. Youth Party representative Chen Qitian then stated: that he deeply felt that the reason why China has not been able to complete a good constitution is based on the stubborn prejudices of all parties and has not taken into account two things: one is disregarding whether the constitution can have good effects and focusing on international relations, and the other is not paying attention to practical effects, so it cannot obtain successful factors. Based on the above two points, the powers of the National Assembly are even higher than those stipulated in the Five-Five Draft Constitution, which will make the international situation even worse. He is not speaking for the Youth Party, but for the compatriots of the whole country. This issue may cause political changes. He believes that the expansion of the powers of the National Assembly by the amendment will not have any effect, because the National Assembly meets once every two years, so it is difficult to talk about practical effects. If we want to realize true popular supervision of the government, it is not necessary to concentrate power in the National Assembly, but to separate it. He advocated maintaining the original draft. After discussion, the third clause of Article 27 "Initiation of constitutional amendments" was changed to "Amendment of the Constitution." When put to a vote, it passed by a majority of 117 votes.</p>
<p>Convening of Meetings</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of the convening of the National Assembly, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that the amendment would change the original Article 29, 30, and 31 into two articles. After discussion, it was decided to amend Article 29 to "The National Assembly shall be convened by the President 90 days before the expiration of each presidential term." Article 30 should use the amended opinion, and Article 31 should be deleted.</p>
<p>People's Public Service</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of people's public service, the First Review Committee had amended Article 21, adding the word "corvée". The Democratic Socialist Party raised an objection, believing that the addition of corvée would easily be exploited by officials, township chiefs, paochia, and local bullies at all levels, depriving the people of their freedom and causing social unrest, and the original draft should be maintained. This case caused a dispute, and then Chen Cheng withdrew from the chairman's position, stating: that he advocated maintaining the original draft, which was immediately passed by a majority vote.</p>
<p>Chapters and Sections in Chapter Four</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of chapters and sections in Chapter Four, because some people advocated that Chapter Four should be changed to the central government, and the President, Executive, and Legislative branches should be listed as section headings, while others believed that it was not necessary to divide into chapters, Shi Shangkuan and Lin Bin both spoke. Finally, Li Jingzhai proposed that it should be handed over to the sorting group, which was immediately passed.</p>
<p>Emergency Events</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of emergency events, Jiang Yiping spoke, maintaining the original draft and stating that it was not necessary to add these four words, which was immediately passed at that time.</p>
<p>Powers of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the issue of the powers of the Legislative Yuan, there were many opinions on Article 62, with some believing that the word "national" should be changed to "central", some believing that "the legislative organ is elected by the people" should be changed to "is organized by the people", and some believing that the word "highest" was extremely inappropriate. After a very long discussion, there was no result, and it was decided to hand it over to the sorting group.</p>
<p>Number of Members of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the issue of the number of members of the Legislative Yuan, a majority advocated maintaining the original draft of Article 65, but changing the first paragraph, which stated five people per province and city, to two people per province and city, and increasing one person for every one million people, to increasing one person for every five million people. The issue of the number of representatives from Xinjiang and overseas Chinese was still handed over to the sorting group.</p>
<p>Auditing Power</p>
<p>(8) Article 75 on auditing power should follow the original draft, Article 76 should be deleted, and changed to two articles as follows: (1) The Control Yuan shall establish an Auditor-General, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan; (2) The Auditor-General shall submit an audit report to the Legislative Yuan within three months after the completion of the audit. The meeting adjourned at 5:53 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Amidst Contentious Debates on the Revision of the Draft Constitution, the Democratic Socialist Party Expresses Its Attitude, Requesting the Maintenance of the Principles Discussed in the Political Consultative Conference <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Jin Houcheng, Secretary-General of the Democratic Socialist Party, explained the party's three points of view on the draft constitution at a press reception held by the Central Propaganda Department on the 16th, stating:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the original text of Article 1 of the Constitution, it was once amended by the First Review Committee to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and then amended again by the Comprehensive Committee to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The party believes that this article, which stipulates the form of government, should preferably be changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic." It is claimed that, on this point, President Chiang agreed with representatives of the party and the Youth Party that the four words "Three Principles of the People" should be added solemnly to the foreword.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the chapter on the National Assembly, the party believes that it is inappropriate to have any additions beyond the original powers of the National Assembly. It is now heard that the Comprehensive Committee has added the following clause to the powers of the National Assembly: "The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in the exercise of political power." The party believes that this addition is also inappropriate. As such, it violates the fundamental spirit of democracy. According to the draft constitution, in addition to the National Assembly, there is also a Legislative Yuan, both of which are produced by direct elections. The powers of the National Assembly are limited to electing the President, as in the United States. If the current amendment is followed, it would be close to a one-power system, affecting the Legislative Yuan. It would be inappropriate and undemocratic to implement.</p>
<p>(3) According to the original text of the draft constitution, the President may issue emergency decrees under certain circumstances. However, as a result of the current review, the four words "emergency events" have been added. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country for centuries, not a question of people, but a permanent question. Adding words such as "emergency events" is really inappropriate, so the party advocates maintaining the original draft.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, President Chiang had a written document supporting the amendment.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter two, because the problems occurred after President Chiang met with representatives of the two parties, they were not discussed. However, it is believed that President Chiang also feels that it is better not to add to the powers of the National Assembly. Jin also pointed out that the party attaches the most importance to the above three points, and other insignificant details can be resolved through compromise. The party believes that the reason why the Republic of China has this opportunity to engage in constitutional work is because the Kuomintang is reasonable and hopes to be reasonable to the end so that the constitutional work can be completed.</p>
<p>At today's reception, Xu Chuanlin from the party was originally scheduled to attend, but because Xu attended the Comprehensive Committee, Jin and Li Junfu, another National Assembly representative from the party, attended instead. In addition to reporting the party's attitude towards the draft constitution, Jin also answered other questions related to the party.</p>
<p>A reporter asked what attitude the Democratic Socialist Party would adopt if the above three points could not achieve results satisfactory to the Democratic Socialist Party at the future assembly.</p>
<p>Jin replied: The party believes that this National Assembly is based on the Political Consultative Conference, and the party regrets that the draft constitution was not drafted entirely according to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Some members of the Kuomintang also hold the same view. Most members of the Kuomintang are reasonable and hope that they can be calm and recognize that the party does not need to express its attitude on this.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked whether they would participate in the reorganized government? According to the answer, the Political Consultative Conference did agree at that time that the government should be jointly formed by various parties, but the realization of this matter still depends on the arrival of the opportunity to organize such a government, so the party has not yet considered it. Regarding the relationship between the party and the Democratic League, Jin said: The party's attitude remains unchanged, and hopes that the Democratic League and the Communist Party can understand. As for whether the Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League will order the party to withdraw from the League, Jin said that he could not be sure and would have to consider it when such a situation arises. When asked about the party's own internal strife between the North and the South, Jin admitted that there were such rumors, but said that, at least on the point of participating in the National Assembly, the entire party was united. Jin declined to answer questions about rumors that a certain member of the party had bad habits.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly visited Chairman Chiang at 5:00 PM on the 15th. Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party Liaison Office visited Ambassador Stuart at 12:00 AM on the 16th and met for an hour. According to Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi, Ambassador Stuart informally told Wang Bingnan everything discussed with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 15th, but this was purely ordinary social interaction and could not indicate the possibility of reopening peace talks. Regarding rumors that the government was sending personnel to Yan'an, Mei said that he was not aware of it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Shao Lizi recently told reporters that he had not heard anything about going to Yan'an, but he hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could sincerely unite and cooperate, so if the government really sent him, he would certainly do so. Shao continued, indicating that the joint visit of Marshall and Stuart to Chairman Chiang today, as well as Wang Bingnan's visit to Ambassador Stuart today, may be discussing the issue of sending personnel to Yan'an.</p>

<p>Even if There Are Resolutions in the Review Committee, They Will Definitely Be Vetoed by the Comprehensive Committee and the General Assembly</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] According to Shao Lizi, he is very optimistic about the passage of the draft constitution, believing that although some opposing views have achieved some success in the review committee, they will definitely be vetoed in the comprehensive committee and even the general assembly due to the small number of people. Shao completely agreed with the four points raised by Zhang Junli, believing that they were correct.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] National Assembly representatives Zhao Mingyuan, Li Fengzao, Da Pusheng, Sun Shengwu, etc., representing the Hui people, held a press reception on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall at 2:00 PM on the 16th, reporting their opinions on the draft constitution and their hopes for the National Assembly, stating in brief: The more than 40 million Hui compatriots throughout the country pay the same obligations to the country for military service and tax payments as ordinary citizens, and they should also enjoy equal rights. It is hoped that the Constitution can clearly stipulate the following points: (1) Hui people elect an appropriate number of National Assembly representatives, (2) Hui people elect an appropriate number of members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, (3) Hui people have a fixed number of places to participate in civil organs at all levels, (4) Hui people enjoy equal opportunities in education and special convenience in life.</p>

<p>The Assault Incident Has Not Been Resolved</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] When the National Assembly Comprehensive Committee met on the afternoon of the 16th, hundreds of reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai demonstrated in front of the meeting venue, presenting three demands to Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Assembly: (1) News reporters should be allowed to enter the venue through the main entrance (previously, they only used the side entrance). (2) News reporters must be allowed to attend the Comprehensive Committee meetings and must not be refused their participation. (3) A certain Kuomintang representative who assaulted a reporter the other day should publicly apologize in the newspaper. Secretary-General Hong replied that the first and second conditions could be implemented immediately and ordered the opening of the main entrance, but before responding to the third condition, it was necessary to contact the representative. However, the reporters refused to enter the venue until all three conditions were fully satisfied and demanded a response within 24 hours. If they were rejected, they would ban coverage of the Assembly news.</p>
<h3 id="e10">National Newspapers and News Agencies Collectively Petition the Ministry of Communications, Requesting Preferential Treatment for News Postage and Telegraph Fees <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] National newspapers and news agencies, unable to maintain operations due to the Ministry of Communications suddenly increasing postage and telegraph fees tenfold last month, convened a joint national newspaper association meeting at the Shuzhong Hotel at 1:00 PM on the 16th. More than 100 people attended, chaired by Ma Xingye, who reported on the significance of the National Newspaper Association's organization. Then, Mao Lirui, Tang Shaolan, and Tu Shiming reported on the negotiations with the Ministry of Communications. Representatives from various places also spoke enthusiastically, all dissatisfied with the Ministry of Communications' 30% discount on telephone calls, believing that the price was still seven times higher than the old price and still unaffordable for today's extremely difficult economic situation in the newspaper industry. The preferential treatment was only extended to daily newspapers, not evening newspapers, which was considered unfair. As for postage, it was even more fatal to the newspaper industry. The postage for a mailed newspaper was more than the newspaper fee, which was unreasonable. All agreed that it must be reduced to the original price in order to maintain operations. As a result, a national newspaper petition group was organized, and more than ten people, including Gao Yixiu, were appointed as representatives to petition the Ministry of Communications. At 3:00 PM, the delegation led more than 100 Beijing reporters from national newspapers, setting off in four new Shanghai-bound cars newly supplied to Beijing by the Jiangnan Company. When the cars arrived in front of the Anle Hall in Chongqing, it coincided with the Central Propaganda Department's press reception, and more than 100 reporters from various newspapers in the meeting joined the ranks, arriving at the Ministry of Communications in a mighty and imposing manner. Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Vice Minister Tan Boyu, and Director Tao Fengshan received them. The representatives of the petition group separately stated the suffering of private newspapers unable to maintain operations after the increase in postage and telegraph fees. Yu replied: that he was willing to discuss a proper solution with the petition group. It was decided that Yu himself, Tan Boyu, and Tao Fengshan would conduct a detailed study with the petition delegation at 3:00 PM on the 17th, and all believed that the government might accept the request of national newspapers to give preferential treatment to news postage and telegraph fees.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Communist Army Internal Strife Leads to Guidance Out of the City; National Army Enters Lianshui Yesterday Afternoon; Pixian County Seat Also Recovered the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 16th] The communist army entrenched in Lianshui has unusually complex factions, often engaging in mutual sabotage. Since the ceasefire order took effect, the senior commanders of the communist army in that area launched an offensive against the National Army, intending to ease the friction between various units through the offensive. As for the National Army stationed there, it had advanced to the outskirts of Lianshui city before the ceasefire order took effect. However, due to the restrictions of the ceasefire order and to avoid contact with outposts, it had to temporarily retreat a distance. The Xinhua News Agency of the Communist Army took the opportunity to exaggerate its war achievements, claiming that it had turned from passive to active. Its offensive plan, dispatching troops and generals, will become even more active. Xu Xiangqian's 5th and 9th Liberation Divisions, and the 5th Military Sub-district troops in Northern Jiangsu, had accumulated deep grievances, making it difficult to reconcile for a time. Last night, a sudden fire broke out in Lianshui city, and heavy gunfire was heard. This morning, a unit of the communist army surrendered to the National Army, detailing the chaos in the city and offering to guide the National Army into the city to stabilize order. A unit of the National Army then rushed into the city with the surrendered communist army at 12:00 noon today to maintain security. Currently, the remaining troops of the 5th and 9th Liberation Divisions in the city have fled to the northeast of the city. The remaining troops of the 5th Military Sub-district have all surrendered to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] A unit of the National Army crossed the Grand Canal on the morning of the 15th and stationed in Pixian County Seat. County Magistrate Xin Yutang followed the army into the city to comfort the displaced people and compile and investigate the Baojia system.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] Confirmed news: After the National Army recovered Yancheng on the 13th, the communist armies in various counties in northern Jiangsu were greatly shocked. The communist army trapped in Funing felt threatened and recklessly launched a desperate attack on Yancheng at dawn on the 15th. At the same time, the communist armies in coastal areas such as Dongtai Bin Hai also showed signs of attacking Bazao and Jiuzhao in eastern Jiangsu. However, the current strength of the communist army in the above-mentioned areas is indeed less than twenty regiments. This time, they are stirring up trouble again, deliberately exaggerating their claims and falsely spreading their troop strength. According to front-line news, although there is currently fighting northwest of the county seat, the communist army flees in panic as soon as contact is made. Looking at their intentions, they are still thinking of preserving their strength to prepare for sabotage. The so-called large-scale counterattack launched by the communist army in northern Jiangsu with 120,000 troops is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] It is reported that: (1) The battle on the Xinxingchang front north of Yancheng was fierce, with mixed fighting all day yesterday and continuing this morning. In addition, a unit of the communist army attacked from Shanggang to the west yesterday, and occupied Shiqiao at 6:00 this morning. It is now continuing to attack Chenjiaqiao to the west. Because of the disparity in numbers, the National Army moved to Huduo at 9:00 this morning. (2) More than 3,000 communist troops from Shuyang attacked Suqian from Hanji this morning. The National Army is currently intercepting them. (3) The communist troops who had infiltrated the outskirts of Qianji, a village between Huai and , have now been cleared, and fierce fighting continues in Huji.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 16th] The communist army previously besieged Liuzhuang with the main force of the First Division. The highway between that town and Dongtai was once cut off. After the National Army counterattacked, the communist army was defeated and retreated. The National Army took the opportunity to station in Wuyou on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] Recently, news of the war in northern Jiangsu has been conflicting. The actual situation in Yancheng is also being reported differently in Nanjing and Zhenjiang. Our reporter recently learned from reliable sources in Nanjing and Zhenjiang that the communist armies in various counties in northern Jiangsu are indeed trying their last struggle, but the National Army is still on the defensive and there are no large-scale battles. It is also heard that the military will soon release accurate news about the various counties in northern Jiangsu (including the actual situation in Yancheng) to set the record straight and dispel public doubts.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Wang Hongshao Talks: The area between Fangshunqiao and Wangdu, south of Baoding, which has long been harassed by the communist army, is now stable. Saidi in eastern Hebei can still be recovered soon. The National Army in southern Hebei is still between Qingfeng and Nanle. Reports of fierce fighting near Dage are not accurate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Military News: Luofa Town, west of Gu'an south of Ping, was captured by the communist army at 3:00 this morning. After the National Army counterattacked, it was recovered at 7:00. In addition, Zhugezhuang, near Changxindian, was also attacked by more than 500 communist soldiers last night.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The highest command of the CCP in Shandong, the so-called "Shandong Liberation Alliance Army Forward Command Post," and all its personnel, arrived in Yishui from Yan'an on the 11th to discuss the offensive plan in Shandong Province with Chen Yi.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters said: According to reports from military authorities in Shanxi, Zhongyang has not fallen. A support army arrived near Zhongyang, twenty Huali away. However, the communist side claimed that the communist army had captured Zhongyang on the 12th and captured 1,600 people, including Deputy Division Commander Zhang Hongqian of the 45th Division. They also claimed that this was the sixth county town recently captured by the communist army in western Shanxi. Therefore, the communist-occupied areas in southwestern and northwestern Shanxi have been connected into one piece. According to reports here, communications in Zhongyang were interrupted on the 12th, and it fell on the dawn of the 14th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The communist army in Shandong Province is now forcibly implementing a so-called "immigration policy." The Taishan Administrative Office of the Communist Army ordered the people of Village A to exchange farmland and houses with the people of Village B. The method is to first hand over everything to the communist army for safekeeping, depriving the people of their autonomy over their land and homes, and then redistribute it by the army. Each person is given two Mu of land to cultivate on their own. When the ordinary people are forced to leave their ancestral homes, they are heartbroken and weep uncontrollably.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 16th] Chongli County, Chahar, ninety Huali away from Zhangjiakou, was occupied by the communist army on the 9th of this month and recovered by the National Army on the 12th. During the three days that the communist army occupied it, the devastation was unprecedented. Three days after the recovery, the Zhangjiakou press specially organized an inspection tour to inspect the area. When reporters arrived, although it was three days after the looting, the whole city was still ablaze with smoke and corpses were everywhere. The sound of wailing was incessant. In just one corner of the south of the city, there were more than 400 corpses shot to death by communist army machine guns. After entering the city, the scene was very tragic. Being in it was like being in hell on earth. The number of dead was secondary to the gruesome ways they were killed. Extracting eyes and hearts, disemboweling chests and abdomens, were common occurrences. Some had their lower bodies or anuses cut off by bayonets. The most tragic was one person that the reporter saw nailed to the wall, with his eyes and liver all dug out, and his legs cut off and hung high on nearby branches. There were also those who were tied back-to-back and then stoned to death. Women were mostly stripped naked, had their breasts cut off, and burned to death. Because most of them were burned to ashes, the number could not be counted. It was heard that more than 200 people were burned to death on the first floor of the Catholic Church. Even eighty-year-old elders and months-old infants were not spared. The innocent civilians died so tragically, which is truly outrageous and heartbreaking.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, GuiSui, 15th] The full-line repair of the PingSui Railway was completed at the railway connection east of the Luowenzao Station at 8 PM on the 10th, and military transportation began the next morning. It is decided here that passenger and freight transportation will be handled on the 20th, and a special train will be used to invite reporters from ten GuiSui newspapers to visit the area east of Datong. In the past, it took one day and night to travel from Beiping to Baotou. In the future, it will be necessary to spend the night in Xulongqiao, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Jining, and GuiSui, and it will take six days to enter Baotou Station. The Yanbei Corridor is the most difficult to pass through. Up to now, the communist army is still entrenched near Wangguantun and Gushan.

<h3 id="e28">The Situation in the Northeast is Still Stable: There Will Not Be a Major War This Winter; The Communist Army Attacking Pulandian Was Repelled <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Although the situation in the Northeast is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, there will not be a large-scale war this winter. According to a military official in charge of the Northeast's current situation: There are still more than 10,000 communist troops in the southern Lushun, Dalian, and Jinzhou areas, and some aircraft received from the Japanese are active in the Jinzhou area. A plane crashed in the Jinzhou area a few days ago. The communist army that attacked Pulandian has now been repelled. Although the Songhua River in the north has frozen over, there is a mobile unit that can cope with attacks from any direction. The communist army north of the Songhua River is quite distressed. There are cases of requisitioning civilian clothing in Harbin and Qiqihar. The strength of the National Army in Jilin seems to have increased, but it is to strengthen defense and should not be seen as any preparations for an attack. In the western Nong'an area, the communist army has repeatedly attacked and been defeated, and the people have suffered a lot. Taonan and Nong'an are the places where the plague originated in the Northeast. I don't know what will happen this winter? In the eastern Andong area, the An-Shen line will be open to traffic soon, and most of the communist troops in the area have been cleared. However, the Communist Party has recently been forcing and wooing the people very harshly. Some areas hope for the National Army but still cannot see it, or they are taking a stronger attitude to deal with the communist army. Therefore, the longer it is delayed, the more profound it will become. This is the trend in some areas in the north and east. In Andong, weapons hidden by the communist army have recently been found in rural areas, because some people are afraid of retaliation from the communist army and dare not report it.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Tanggu New Port: Lock Gate Trial Navigation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 15th] The lock gate of Tanggu New Port held a trial navigation on the 15th. Reporters were invited to visit. At high tide, the water depth of the lock gate can reach 8 meters, enough to accommodate 10,000-ton ships. However, the Hai River does not have this depth. Ships of 3,000 tons can now pass through the lock gate and sail to Tianjin. The trial navigation situation today was very smooth. The Jinxing ship of the engineering bureau entered the gate for trial, adjusted the water level, and exited the gate, taking half an hour in total. The 13-kilometer channel outside the gate was originally excavated to a depth of 6 meters by the Japanese, but it has been silted up by 1.5 meters over the years and needs to be dredged urgently so that 3,000-ton ships can freely enter and exit. The Engineering Bureau plans to complete a throughput of 1 million to 4 million tons per year within three years, and will complete two deep-water berths to accommodate 30,000-ton ships.</p>

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 16th] US military officials here declared today: The date of the withdrawal of US troops from North China has not yet been determined. Well-informed sources expressed their opinions on Secretary of State Byrnes' recent statement that the mission of the US troops in North China has been completed and orders to return home have been issued, saying that the US troops in Pingjin and Tanggu will not be withdrawn immediately, and may not leave China before next spring. As for the US troops in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, they will return home within the next two weeks. According to observers with good sources of information, Byrnes's statement that orders to return home have been issued is carefully worded and consistent with the facts. The First Marine Division in North China was ordered three weeks ago to prepare a withdrawal plan, but it has been revised twice since then. The second revision was made a month ago. Most observers believe that the troops will continue to be stationed in North China until the Beiping Military Mediation Department is dissolved. The current official mission is to maintain the transportation line from Tanggu via Tianjin to Beiping. The unofficial mission is to protect the safety of the US personnel and their families in the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Coal Shortage in Changchun is Extremely Serious: Civil Servants Work in Rooms at Minus 25 Degrees Celsius; Representatives from the Press Arrive in Shenyang to Appeal for Assistance from All Walks of Life <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Changchun is suffering from a coal shortage. Liu Zhu, Shi Wenjin, and Nie Shiqi, representatives from Changchun's press, came to Shenyang to appeal on behalf of the citizens of Changchun. They have now obtained the support of the military and government leaders, who are providing full assistance. Shenyang can send back 75 trucks every day, and Chairman Liang has also agreed to transport a portion from Jilin. In addition, a portion can be transported from Xi'an. In this way, the crisis in Changchun can be alleviated to some extent. Liu and others will return to Changchun on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Changchun Mayor Zhao Junmai came to Shenyang on the 15th and flew to Pingjing on the 16th to report the situation. Zhao told reporters that the hunger and cold in Changchun are difficult to describe in one word. The 620,000 citizens are currently receiving very little coal. City government officials are working indoors at minus 25 degrees Celsius. If there is no coal relief, the power plant will have no heating and the water pipes will freeze. Factories are also in the same situation. Changchun was the capital of Manchukuo, and tap water is common, resulting in a lack of water wells. If tap water freezes, it will be impossible to dig wells in the severe cold. Without a large amount of coal, unimaginable consequences will occur. Therefore, I am very grateful for the efforts of the press representatives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] The coal shortage in Changchun and Shenyang is severe. Various railway bureaus are considering completely stopping freight transportation in order to concentrate vehicles and strengthen coal transportation. The Northeast Railway Transportation Coordination Committee will be established soon to be responsible for overall planning. Chen Changjiong, a special envoy of the Ministry of Transportation in the Northeast, will serve as the chairman. All vehicles of various railway bureaus, whether state-owned or belonging to the China Chang Railway, will be uniformly allocated by the committee. 1,350 trucks will be allocated specifically to transport coal from Xi'an, which is expected to transport 1,950 tons per day.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Sino-Siamese Friendship Still Needs Further Development <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The name "Siam" was given to this country by the Chinese. Siam was originally the name of two countries, Siam and Luo. Siam evolved from the Ailao Kingdom of the Later Han Dynasty, the Nanzhao Kingdom of the Tang Dynasty, and the Dali Kingdom of the Song Dynasty, and its capital was built in Mengfan. The sound of "Siam" is similar to "Shan," and geographers believe that the Kingdom of Siam may be the Shan Kingdom. Luo was the Kingdom of Lavo, which occupied Zhenla and Sukhothai. In 1317, King Kun Lakhamhaeng of Siam died, and the kingdom's power declined daily. During the Zhizheng era of Emperor Huizong, Lavo annexed Siam. Our imperial court, on the contrary, put the name of the conquered country first, combining them and calling it Siam.</p>
<p>Sino-Siamese relations have a long history. At least 2,000 years ago, there were historical records indicating that relations existed as far back as 1877 years ago, before outsiders invaded Zhenla (Cambodia). Since then, during the Later Han, Liang, Sui, Three Kingdoms, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, there were tributes in every era. In the eighth year of Tongzhi, tribute was stopped because Siam refused to present tribute with the required ceremonial rites, and contact between the two countries became less frequent.</p>
<p>Geographically, China and Siam seem like one family. Europeans sometimes write "China-Siam" on envelopes when sending letters to Siam. According to a 1937 government census, the population of Siam had reached 14,996,000, of which overseas Chinese numbered over 3 million, accounting for one-quarter of the total population. In fact, most Siamese people today have mixed Chinese blood, especially in political circles, where many people have Chinese ancestry. Siamese elder statesman Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena is a prominent example. His ancestral home is in Xiatang Village, Chenghai, Guangdong, and his Chinese name is Chen Jiale. The Siamese ethnic groups include Thai, Lao, Cambodian, and Shan. There are also many Chinese ethnic groups. Except for the Chinese, the rest are all Dai ethnic groups or branches of the Tai ethnic group.</p>
<p>According to the Italian archaeologist C. Gerini, most of the Dai ethnic groups in the three provinces of southern Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi in China today, and the Yi people in southwestern China, are a type of Dai ethnic group and belong to the same system as the Siamese ethnic groups. The dialects in Guangxi, Longzhou, and other places are mostly similar to modern Siamese, and their customs and languages are also very similar, which confirms the difficulty of separating China and Siam.</p>
<p>The Chinese have saved Siam twice. The first time was when King Bang Suzhi of Sukhothai first ascended the throne, and the country was in turmoil. China sent soldiers, warriors, craftsmen, and cannons to quell the rebellion. The second time was in 1767 (the 32nd year of Qianlong) when Zhao Dechen (also known as Zhao or Zheng Xin, where Zhao is the Siamese word for "king" and Xin is the Siamese word for "wealth"), a native of Chaozhou, Guangdong, who served in the Siamese government, single-handedly defeated the Burmese army's invasion and laid the foundation for Siam's freedom and independence.</p>
<p>The evolution of Siamese culture can be divided into three periods: Buddhist culture, Chinese culture, and Europeanization. The cultural trend of the second period changed due to political changes. When Zhao Dechen rose up to restore the country, the Siamese people were in awe of China, and Zhao also promoted this idea. More and more Chinese people came to Siam, and their superior culture was far beyond Siam's reach. As a result, the entire country strived to learn Chinese culture, and Siamese writing and art were all influenced by China, eventually creating a mixed Sino-Siamese civilization.</p>
<p>The world knows that Siam is famous for its four major resources: rice, tin, rubber, and teak, which account for about 80% of its annual exports. However, what is not known is that the development of these major resources was led by overseas Chinese, who shed blood and sweat for them. Today, Siam is able to be self-sufficient and stand independently in Asia. China has indeed not failed Siam, but since Siam stopped paying tribute, it has never been kind to us. In 1920, it banned our overseas Chinese schools, and after the 1932 coup, it implemented a new economic policy, engaging in anti-Chinese activities. In 1939, Phibul Songkhram and Direk Jayanama colluded with the Japanese to change the country's name to Thailand and advocated "Rathaniyom" (Thai nationalism), specifically targeting overseas Chinese as the object of Thai nationalism, using anti-Chinese discrimination as a means of Thai nationalism. When our country's War of Resistance was at a critical juncture, the Siamese authorities flattered Japan and intensified their anti-Chinese activities, hiring Japanese as advisors and enacting twenty-one harsh anti-Chinese regulations. This oppression became tighter and tighter, day by day, leading to the bankruptcy of overseas Chinese businesses, the closure of overseas Chinese schools, and the endangerment of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>When the motherland won the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in Siam did not win victory. On the contrary, they suffered a catastrophe because of the victory, which continued until August 30th. However, China's friendship with others is absolutely not based on "opportunism" or "exploitation." Only friendship based on righteousness and justice can be lasting. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly stated in "China's Destiny" that "China's political philosophy is to make the techniques of war and production serve human life," so "during the period of the strong and prosperous Chinese state, Asian nations never experienced economic aggression or political annexation, nor were there any divisions of imperialism and colonies." Just as President Truman said, "The pursuit of security should be the pursuit of common security for the entire world, not the pursuit of security for one country at the expense of threatening the security of the world."</p>
<p>Siam became secure because of the two statements made by Chairman Chiang and President Truman, but our overseas Chinese in Siam are not yet secure. The laws and regulations that hinder overseas Chinese education and economy have not yet been abolished or revised, and the three million overseas Chinese are still living in anxiety. We welcome the new Siamese ambassador to China, Nai Sarawut Durarat, and hope that he can promote further progress in Siamese thinking. Due to the development of science, the Earth has shrunk. Great figures can no longer be trapped in the chauvinistic narrow nationalism. Before this Siamese elder statesman visited China, he told our reporter two proverbs: "A narrow land can be lived on, but a narrow mind is hard to live with." This is worth pondering.</p>
<p>China and Siam are one family, and Sino-Siamese relations are forever inseparable, but our friendship should go further.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Starting with Peking University's Anniversary <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 48th anniversary of the founding of National Peking University, the anniversary of "Peking University." Originally, in present-day China, the number of universities is already quite large, and many of them are also national universities. The anniversary of a university may not necessarily attract national attention, except for the celebration by the university's faculty and staff. However, the anniversary of Peking University is special. First, historically, Peking University is one of the earliest national universities in modern China. From the Imperial University of Peking to the present, although there have been changes in the interim, it has been passed down in one continuous line and is still the leader of the highest institutions of learning. Second, because Peking University is the only national university in modern China, the teachers and students of Peking University are the backbone of society in China today, spread throughout all levels of the country, and have played a considerable role in modern Chinese society. Therefore, today's anniversary of Peking University is celebrated by people outside Peking University as well. Forty-eight years is an extremely short period in our nation's history, but the past forty-eight years have been a critical juncture in our nation's history. During this period, we have seen the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire and the rebirth of the Chinese nation, defeating Japan's attempted invasion with eight years of long-term resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, National Peking University is celebrating this anniversary during the presidency of Hu Shih. We firmly believe that Peking University in the future will be able to build upon its past glory and develop even further.</p>
<p>When we mention Peking University, no one can forget how the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of Peking University, pushed forward the high tide of the National Revolution. This is the most meaningful page in the Chinese nation's self-awareness movement and political democracy movement. The impact of this movement on Chinese culture and socio-political life can be said to be unprecedented. Most of the people who participated in this movement are now middle-aged. The vigorous vigor of that year has now subsided. Today, when we commemorate the anniversary of Peking University, we cannot help but feel many emotions. We cannot allow this declining situation to continue. We must find ways to promote and develop the May Fourth spirit, which is the most meaningful measure to commemorate the anniversary of Peking University. What is this May Fourth spirit? It is the pursuit of democracy and freedom. Chinese students played the greatest role during the May Fourth Movement, seemingly echoing the German student movement in the mid-nineteenth century in human history. And in the Chinese student movement at that time, Peking University was undoubtedly in a leading position. The May Fourth Movement has become history, but the spirit of the May Fourth Movement still needs to be developed today. This is the first point that comes to mind when we commemorate the anniversary of Peking University today.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peking University was the only highest institution of learning in the country at that time. Now, universities have been established throughout the country in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality, they are generally declining. Moreover, the purpose of university education itself is becoming increasingly unclear. When Mr. Cai Yuanpei presided over Peking University, he referred to the advantages of universities in continental Europe and the United States, aiming to cultivate generalists. Therefore, he especially emphasized humanities and academic research. The current trend of university education seems to be to create advanced craftsmen, rather than to cultivate generalists, which seems to have lost the original purpose of university education. Universities should focus on independent academic research, not on the transmission of knowledge and skills. Because of the anniversary of Peking University, we feel that it is necessary to re-examine the current university education in our country. We must first recognize the purpose of university education and then seek further reforms. As for the quality of universities, we believe that the increase in quantity will inevitably affect quality. Although the reasons for the decline in the quality of university education today are not simple, the increase in quantity inevitably leads to a decline in quality. Therefore, we believe that it is better to run a small number of universities and improve their quality than to run a large number of universities and allow their quality to decline. The number of famous universities in a country is definitely not large, and the national universities in a country should be on par with the famous universities in other countries in terms of standards.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation in our country, the problems involved in university education in our country at this stage are very broad. There are original interrelationships. The shortage of university funding naturally has a great impact on the development of university education. And the shortage of university funding is caused by the current political and economic situation. But we cannot not think of improving because of the complexity of the relationship. Because of the anniversary of Peking University, we should think about how to refresh our higher education. The long-term stability of the country depends on the relationship of university education. It's really not light; we can't delay another forty-eight years.</p>

Fellow Villagers from Various Counties in Jinan Appeal for Dispatch of Strong Troops and Allocation of Relief Funds to Alleviate People's Suffering. <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper in Jinan) The current situation in Shandong Province is about to become serious again as the Communist troops invade from all sides. Moreover, the number of refugees fleeing to this city has continued to increase, crying from hunger and cold, awaiting relief. The United Federation of Fellow Villagers Associations from various counties in Shandong Province in Jinan, under this major situation, convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors of various administrative regions on the 12th to discuss countermeasures. The following is a summary of the resolved matters: (1) As the Communist troops are currently invading from all sides, the situation in Shandong Province has turned tense again, all unanimously advocated to send telegrams separately to the National Government Chiang Chairman, Ministry of National Defense Bai Minister. Chief of Staff Chen, and Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Director Xue, appealing for the dispatch of strong troops into Shandong to protect the results of reconstruction and alleviate the suffering of the people of Shandong. (2) The Relief and Relief Committee previously issued 300 million yuan of emergency relief funds, but some counties have not been issued because of delayed application or unclear procedures. It was decided to send another letter requesting that all existing relief funds be re-distributed according to the number of refugees currently in this city. Moreover, as the committee is a province-wide relief agency and this association is a province-wide mass organization, it is proposed to publicly recommend several representatives to participate in the committee to contribute relief opinions. (3) The small loans for refugees previously organized by the Shandong Provincial Bank were not fair to all counties, and the procedures were complicated, causing difficulties for the refugees. It was decided to publicly recommend several representatives to go to the bank to ask for the average lending to be distributed to all counties and to simplify the procedures. (4) It was decided to send telegrams to the national representatives of this province in Beijing, requesting the government, and to send telegrams to fellow villagers associations in Pinghu and other places, appealing for a large amount of relief funds to tide over the winter. (5) The Jinan Municipal Government was requested to impose an additional 20% refugee donation on restaurants, restaurants and various entertainment venues to expand relief. (6) The Shandong Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Commission was requested to resume the project and adopt a work-for-relief method for relief, and refugees from various counties should have priority. (7) The Peiyang Grand Theater was requested to perform a charity drama, and all ticket prices were used to help refugees. (8) The Rescue and Relief Administration was requested to issue return travel expenses to refugees in the recovered counties who volunteered to return to their hometowns, provided that they had proof from the fellow villagers association in their county, to facilitate relief and benefit reconstruction.</p>

<p>(Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting with the Commissioners of the first, second, and third districts on the 13th to strengthen the efficiency of local administrative work in the counties south of the Yangtze River. The main points of the discussion are recorded below: (1) Regarding county funds, they will be divided into two parts: A. Funds above the district level will be included in the county budget, and expenditures will be based on income. The budget will be prepared based on the actual situation of each county, and the county magistrate and finance section chief will be convened by the provincial government to discuss it. It must meet the actual needs of the local area, and a reserve fund should be listed, and the living expenses of employees should be considered, so that they can be paid on time. B. Funds below the district level will be raised by themselves. The funds for the township offices will be 1.5 million yuan per month, and the office expenses for the Bao will be 100,000 yuan per month. The county government and the County Provisional Assembly will decide on the amount, and the township people's representatives will approve it. The amount will be collected at one time, handed over to the county government, and distributed on a monthly basis. C. The expenses for the central national schools and self-defense teams in the townships, which are not included in the budget, will be collected according to the previous principles. (2) The township Baojia system will be reorganized. The past decimal system is not entirely suitable. Because the counties south of the Yangtze River are densely populated, it has been decided to change the organization to thirty households per Jia, thirty Jia per Bao, and thirty Bao per township, so as to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources. (3) The township and Bao chiefs should be selected carefully, and traitors should not be appointed. (4) The local self-defense forces should be concentrated in the district to avoid dispersion. (5) The organization of the county security team should have three or four companies, based on the principle of being able to protect local security. Those with less than two companies must not establish a brigade headquarters. (6) The cadre training institutes in each county must be prepared and opened for training immediately. The training period can be shortened from one month to two weeks to avoid affecting business. (7) The price of military grain rice in each county must be 17,800 yuan per stone, including transportation costs, according to the purchase price stipulated by the central government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Report] This year, various counties in southern Zhejiang Province, such as Yongjia, Ruian, Lishui, Yunhe, Quzhou, and other places, have successively experienced outbreaks of plague, occurring intermittently and failing to be completely eradicated. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Health Department speaking to our newspaper reporter, during the years of the Republic, the enemy Japanese used aircraft to dissolve germs in flour and scatter it in Quzhou and Ningbo. As a result, plague outbreaks occurred in these two counties. Fortunately, the authorities in Ningbo took decisive measures to burn down the affected areas, thus eradicating the plague. Quzhou's response was slower, and the infection spread more severely. By the 31st year, the enemy had fled, and Quzhou was severely damaged, thus the plague subsided. However, the counties invaded from northern Fujian, such as Qingyuan and Yunhe, and even Lishui and Yongjia, suffered greatly. This year, more than 200 people have died from the plague, with Yongjia being the worst affected. The local authorities are now being ordered to actively take preventive measures, otherwise, the plague will rage rampantly next spring.</p>

The writer was in Huangyan at the time and knows the truth of the matter: On the night of the 8th of this month, at 2:30 AM, a fire broke out in a cotton batting shop due to careless smoking during gambling. The wind was very strong that night, and it was impossible to put out the fire. It burned for about three hours before it was extinguished. It is estimated that one elderly person who could not walk died, and only more than 100 houses were destroyed (the fire started at the entrance of Siting Lane, extending south along the main street to the entrance of Si Hou Lane, and north to the south of Qiaotingtou). Your newspaper's report that nearly half of the city was destroyed and hundreds of infants were burned to death is inaccurate. Please correct it as above.</p>

<h3 id="e71">West · Lake · Snow · Attire <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Report Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>On December 11, 35th year of the Republic, the world-famous West Lake put on its snowy attire. According to people who have not left Hangzhou in recent years, such continuous snowfall all day long in winter is rare in the last decade. Even last year, the first winter after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone thought that auspicious snow would come with the victory, but West Lake was not allowed to put on its white attire, so that the tourists who had been away for nine years could admire it.</p>
<p>Ugliness Is All Covered Up</p>
<p>The heavy snow on the 11th really covered up the ugliness of this garden city that is under construction, leaving only the pure white beauty, which is really a beautiful park. Looking out from the lakefront, the many mountains surrounding West Lake seem to be closer. On Su Causeway and Bai Causeway, the withered branches and leaves have been piled into white flower balls. The Little Yingzhou of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, the Huxin Pavilion, Ruan Gong Dun, and the Memorial Tower of the Exposition have become four large white balls of different shapes in the lake. Baochu Pagoda and Baochu Mountain are like giant silver cauldrons. The few proud chrysanthemums in the Lakeside Park are still fighting against the snow, but they are eventually painted white. Perhaps only the plums on Solitary Hill can take advantage of this heavy snowfall to sprout and bud quickly. Sure enough, some wealthy people went to Broken Bridge to enjoy the snow, and some rented boats on the lakefront, because they were piled with snow, the desolate and lonely situation was decorated away. The boats, the begging beggars, the fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain, and the prostitutes on Yingshi Street have all disappeared. The quiet and comfortable West Lake certainly showed purity and nobility at that time.</p>
<p>Whiteness Is Just A Craving</p>
<p>Unfortunately, snow is not flour, nor cotton, let alone silver that can be exchanged. It cannot provide warmth and fullness to the poor people on the entire West Lake. This kind of giving is fake, and it will soon pass away. When it passes away, all the ugliness will be exposed again. Therefore, snow is fundamentally perfunctory. It just comes like this, letting people crave this whiteness, hope for this light, but all the corruption is still growing under its whiteness! If you don't believe me, a group of children from the orphanage, braving the wind and snow, running barefoot on the snow to find another group of children from the orphanage, resulted in twelve children being recruited into their team. In addition, cotton clothes and flour are exactly what the poor people are tremblingly demanding, but such a good opportunity to "send charcoal in the snow" to donate clothes and flour on the 11th was missed. Is it necessary to show kindness again in the hot sun? "Helping the poor is like fighting a fire." I hope you don't delay the procedures any longer, quickly investigate the situation, and give it to them urgently. Don't just spend your time planning how to write the report!</p>
<p>Recently, the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration replaced old clothes with cotton cloth for public servants and teachers. It was very crowded. Seven or eight people fell into the water because of the crowd, and one person fell into a pit, but still could not get a satisfactory result. We Chinese are negligent, and we also like petty advantages. Under the influence of these two fundamental natures, we have lost the unfortunate events that have occurred, even though several newspapers are clamoring and shouting.</p>
<p>After This Heavy Snow</p>
<p>After this heavy snow, I am afraid that illegal events will increase in this severe winter. In the past, according to the statistics for November, the most illegal events were similar to gambling, confusion, obstruction of traffic, and obstruction of others' physical freedom. Hangzhou Southeast Daily used "So Hangzhou!" as the title, asking readers to look at the statistics of illegal cases, but in this ice-like severe winter, there is no way to reduce the above events, and the poor who are plagued by hunger and cold, what will they need, will naturally be listed as another case in illegal cases.</p>
<p>The stores, in this heavy snow, still encouraged the courage they could no longer encourage, turned on the neon lights, and used the wireless radio to call out with all their strength, but the shopkeepers bent their backs, tightened their hands, and had nothing to do. This is the eve of the collapse in the midst of the commercial depression. Only the usurers light a fire in this storm, and embrace girls to play, but their fate is already doomed. If they kill all the objects of their loans, they will only fall down and perish together.</p>
<p>Auspicious Snow Foretells a Good Harvest!</p>
<p>A more agreeable sentence is "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." Yes, this snow froze all the pests. But the old farmers in the countryside, who are already burdened, cannot lift the enthusiasm of "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." In recent years, the money earned from hard work in the countryside has all flowed out, becoming floating capital, and it has also become high interest, which once again exploits the countryside. The use of land is limited, and people's energy is also limited. Moreover, the population in the countryside is gradually escaping from the countryside. The blood of the countryside is about to be drained. People in the cities, what are they talking about "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest"? Recently, agricultural products have been picked out of the countryside, and there has been heavy exploitation. Layers of profits have been added, but the countryside has not benefited, the farmers have not benefited, only some intermediate bloodsuckers have grown fat. Therefore, under the "Auspicious Snow", pork has become more expensive, vegetables have become more expensive, eggs have become more expensive, and even green onions, garlic, and tofu have become more expensive. We want to examine the profits after these price increases. If they really benefit the farmers, it is also appropriate. It is a pity that these profits make the final recipients turn around and do high-interest buying and selling.</p>
<p>Please Return To The Countryside</p>
<p>In today's West Lake, today's Hangzhou City, it can be said that most of it still relies on the countryside to nourish it. If we ignore this point, then this beautiful West Lake will also wither and decline. Therefore, in this severe winter, we have reason to ask some people who are shouting for winter relief, people who are preparing large amounts of flour and cotton clothing for relief. If they have not found the poor, please go to the countryside near Pillow City to investigate and donate. If the poor in the city want to ask why they especially value the countryside? We can ask them to go back to the countryside to work, so as not to be idle in the city.</p>
<p>Those banks and money houses with magnificent decorations in the large foreign buildings, please take a break from the city loans! Quickly lend money to the countryside to nourish the countryside, and don't let it out for people to do high-interest loans! Because the banks and money houses themselves are going to be in trouble!</p>
<p>Wake Up The Garden City</p>
<p>Silver, flour, and cotton are all symbolized by snow. "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." Perhaps next year can make the social situation better, but looking at our countryside, there is really nothing to grasp. We must urgently wake up the people in this garden city and pay close attention to the development of the countryside near this city. [12th]</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Indian Interim Government Is Considering Declaring Independence Within Three Days. Nehru Claims That Britain Cannot Interfere in India's Internal Affairs. Britain Insists That Indian-Muslim Cooperation Is a Prerequisite for Independence. <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[United Press India Pinars 15th] Nehru, Vice-Chairman of the Indian Interim Government, declared here today: India will declare separation from the British Empire within three days. The constitution decided by the Indian Constituent Assembly will not be submitted to the British Parliament for approval. We no longer expect anything from London and have decided to solve the problem ourselves. The Congress Party has decided to move forward bravely. Britain is unable to prevent Indian independence. The leaders of the Islamic League are reactionaries who do not want India to be free and only follow Britain's lead. Britain may want India to stand up and maintain power in the separation of India and Muslims, creating various difficulties.</p>
<p>[United Press London 16th] British sources said today: Unless the Islamic League participates in the Indian government, Britain will not accept the Indian independence plan. Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Interim Government, recently said that India will declare its separation from Britain within three days, but the British side mainly believes that the Islamic League must participate in the interim government for Indian independence. No matter what Nehru personally declares, Britain's position will not change. The Indian Affairs Department refused to comment on Nehru's statement, and refused to discuss what would happen if the Indian Parliament passed a bill declaring independence.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New Delhi 15th] Nehru, Vice-Chairman of the Indian Interim Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, has aroused negative reactions from the Indian Council of Aristocrats after submitting a draft resolution at the Constituent Assembly some days ago. According to a public statement issued by the committee of the Aristocratic Council responsible for negotiating with the Constituent Assembly: Vice-Chairman Nehru has proposed a draft resolution on the ten basic issues at the preliminary meeting of the Constituent Assembly. This committee is deeply regretful. The Constituent Assembly cannot and should not consider or decide on these basic issues before the provinces of India have sent representatives, and before the committees of the provinces have negotiated with the British-Indian group committee of the Constituent Assembly. It is obvious that the basic issues proposed in the draft resolution should be discussed by the representatives of the provinces of India when drafting a constitution that can be accepted by the entire country.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 15th] The Labour Party's Rheinhold News recently published an article severely criticizing the speech made by former Prime Minister Churchill in the Lower House. The article said: "The Lower House has been discussing the Indian issue for two days. The Conservative Party's failure to adopt a constructive policy on the major issues related to the empire facing the parliament has been fully exposed. Churchill himself and the Indian people who hope to lead the country must understand that since the Labour Party government can be supported by the people of the whole country, it must seek to implement the greatest liberation action in history with determination. There are great difficulties in transferring power by peaceful means, but the Labour Party government does not secretly hope for its failure because of difficulties, and hopes to overcome these difficulties through consultations and compromises with great patience. This is the first time that Britain has such a government in the relationship between Britain and India.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The First UN General Assembly Achieved Great Success. Spaak Delivered the Closing Speech. The General Assembly Decided to Establish an International Refugee Organization. Thailand Was Approved to Join as the 55th Member State. <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] The Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, said in his closing speech today: "The General Assembly has come to a successful conclusion today. When you return home, you can convey a message full of confidence and hope to your government and people. The General Assembly has passed many important cases, and the disarmament resolution is the most important. The courage of the Soviet delegation to raise this issue, and the courage of other delegations to follow, is commendable. Apart from the Franco issue, there is no more important issue than the international disarmament resolution. If the agencies responsible for implementing this resolution can succeed, the world will enter a new era. The United Nations is more advanced than the old League of Nations. When I was in Geneva in the past, I often felt that I was among diplomats, but here I feel that I am among politicians. The United Nations has become the parliament of the world." Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lai Yi, continued to speak, saying that we have indeed witnessed the birth of the world parliament here. We feel that the signs of peace are stronger than ever before. Lai Yi thanked Chairman Spaak, the delegations of the United Nations, the press, and the Secretariat of the United Nations, and strongly stated that the democratic principles displayed in the General Assembly have been used to the greatest extent. The representatives of various countries and groups have almost all made some concessions to seek compromises for the happiness of the world. Although we cannot over-praise the General Assembly, due to the conscience and goodwill of all parties, we have achieved results that we did not dare to expect before.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] The UN General Assembly held a closing meeting today and discussed a number of issues, including the election of Thailand as a member of the United Nations and the establishment of an international refugee organization. The General Assembly also elected Uruguay as the eighth member state of the Special Committee, which is responsible for studying the reports submitted by the trusteeship countries to the UN Secretariat. US representative Mrs. Roosevelt gave an impassioned appeal for refugees, pleading with the General Assembly to do everything possible to prevent one million refugees from falling into the abyss of misery and loneliness. Soviet representative Gromyko refused to have anything to do with this agency, claiming that the agency did not emphasize the greatest importance of repatriating refugees, but instead encouraged refugees in refugee camps to conduct propaganda against their motherland. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM and reopened seven minutes later, immediately passing the establishment of the International Refugee Organization with a majority of 25 votes to 5, with 8 abstentions. The five dissenting votes were cast by Slavic countries. The General Assembly also decided that the refugee agency would be located in Paris or Geneva. The original proposal only mentioned Paris, but the British representative proposed an amendment, arguing that it would be beneficial for the agency to be located near the headquarters of the International Red Cross. The General Assembly then elected Thailand as a member state without encountering any obstacles, and the country will be able to attend the next General Assembly. The last item on the agenda was the proposal by Ukraine that the next UN General Assembly should be held in a European country instead of New York. When this proposal was put to debate, the British representative expressed support, while the Soviet representative opposed it. As a result, it was decided that the next General Assembly would still be held in New York in September next year.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent New York 16th] Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China to the General Assembly, told reporters after the closing of the General Assembly that the breadth and importance of the agenda of this General Assembly was unprecedented in any previous international conference. All resolutions are very important and extremely progressive, containing a spirit of freedom, and will surely promote unprecedented cooperation, shining brightly for the future happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] US delegation leader Austin delivered a farewell speech today before the closing of the General Assembly, saying: "There is only one thing in world history that can be compared to this General Assembly. It is a special honor for the United Nations to hold a meeting in New York and choose New York as its permanent headquarters. Eight weeks ago, the General Assembly opened in an atmosphere of hope and fear, but now it has passed all the tests, and I believe that we have achieved the important goals of the United Nations." Austin then emphasized the importance of the control system and disarmament, and finally thanked Chairman Spaak and UN Secretary-General Lai Yi.</p>

He also expressed his strong belief that next year's Moscow meeting would yield the best results.

When Mr. Molotov touched on the United Nations General Assembly's disarmament resolution, he called it one of the most important plans of the assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e76">General Disarmament Issue Handed Over to Security Council for Handling <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] The UN General Assembly passed a resolution last night advocating immediate measures to ban atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. UN experts are now preparing the first steps for actual disarmament. Responsible parties remain cautious, advising against excessive optimism, but military and scientific experts from several countries will begin working on the extremely complex disarmament issue this week. The issue will be handed over to the Security Council by the General Assembly. At the same time, the Atomic Energy Commission is holding closed meetings on schedule and will soon draft an important report to be submitted to the Security Council around the end of this month. How all these activities can lead to concrete results is still unpredictable today.</p>

<p>[United Press, Zaragoza, Spain, 15th] Franco delivered two defiant speeches to a crowd of 100,000 people today, pointing out that the world is in a state of war and could declare war at any time. He said that as long as materialistic views of life continue to exist in the world, where dishonesty and hypocrisy are commonplace, and adherence to agreements has become a relic of the past, such a situation will inevitably lead to war. A new Pearl Harbor event is not the bombing of naval fleets in harbors or the use of atomic bombs to attack cities and industries, but the fifth column of internal treachery. These people have dual nationalities, one visible on the outside and one hidden on the inside, and they will undermine our system. Foolish and lifeless democracies are willingly opening the door to let wolves into their homes. Franco's speech did not directly address the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly to recall ambassadors to Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 15th] Franco, speaking to the crowd at the graduation ceremony of the Zaragoza Sergeant School today, said that Spain must be prepared to deal with everything, that cherishing peace is not enough, and that we must be prepared to defend it. Recently, armed groups and terrorists have frequently invaded the Spanish border from a certain country, while border officials of that country turn a blind eye. Spain has never been defeated directly by frontal assault; its failures have always been due to internal divisions. Their enemies often say that they will allow the Spanish people to fail on their own, so we must unite, he said.</p>

<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 15th] The leaders of the guerrilla forces in Aegean and Macedonia, Greece, today denied the accusation by Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris that the guerrilla forces intend to establish independence and autonomy. They said that the guerrilla forces only want to establish a "Greek Democratic Army" to confront Tsaldaris' "terrorism and one-party dictatorship." The Deputy Chief of Staff of the guerrilla forces, using the alias Karfa, said today that the guerrilla forces submitted a memorandum to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the 24th of last month, requesting the organization of a joint delegation to investigate the truth in the guerrilla area. Karfa promised to cooperate, saying that he had inspected the rear of the guerrilla forces with reporters from various countries for three days and had submitted a detailed report on the results to the United Nations Secretariat. The guerrilla forces have put forward nine armistice conditions, and if these conditions are not accepted, civil war will continue in Greece. The nine conditions are as follows: (1) Amnesty for political prisoners. (2) British troops are the cause of all the evils of the Greek government and should withdraw from Greece. (3) Recognition of wartime resistance achievements. (4) Resistance personnel participate in the government. (5) Equal rights for democrats and monarchists. (6) Punishment of pro-enemy fascists during the occupation era. (7) Purge pro-enemy elements in the military and political systems. (8) Organize an army that truly represents the country. (9) Re-election. Karfa also stated that his command has no relationship with the Greek left-wing army and the Macedonian "National Liberation Front," but the majority of the guerrilla soldiers previously belonged to these two organizations. Karfa did not announce the strength of his troops, only saying that every mountain is controlled by the guerrilla forces, a statement that has been confirmed by British military intelligence.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Istanbul, Turkey, 15th] According to a dispatch from a correspondent of a local newspaper stationed in northern Greece from Istanbul: Fierce fighting has been taking place between the Greek government forces and the guerrilla forces in the Maricha area near Salonica in western Thrace for five days, and the fighting is still ongoing. The situation there is very serious. The guerrillas have now controlled several villages in the mountains. Railway traffic and postal services from Salonica to Istanbul have been cut off. The activities of the guerrilla forces in the Salonica area have increased unabated, distributing leaflets everywhere, urging people to join the guerrilla forces.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Manila, 16th] There is currently a strong movement in semi-official and private business circles to establish Philippine commercial organizations in various central points around the world, including Shanghai, in order to promote Philippine overseas commerce. Furthermore, in view of the government's promotion of foreign trade activities becoming increasingly widespread, it is now proposed to establish a separate Ministry of Commerce. Currently, agricultural and commercial activities are all handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Manila, 16th] The Director of the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Coscorula, has asked President Roxas to expel ten Chinese merchants because they sold four thousand bags of sugar frozen by the administration for requisition. The government has transferred this case to the Bureau of Expulsion for handling.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Overseas Chinese Stalls</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th] According to Order No. 32 recently promulgated by the Philippine Department of Finance, the stalls in the Manila market will be "cleaned out" on January of next year and stalls will be rented to vendors under the following conditions. First, all stalls operated by Filipinos must reapply before December 31 of this year; second, all stalls owned by foreigners must apply before December 28. In order to restrict stalls operated by foreigners, the order stipulates, "All stalls not operated by Filipinos before December 31, if applied for by Filipinos, shall be rented to the first applicant." It seems that although our overseas Chinese stall vendors can nominally reapply to continue to maintain their stalls, the actual opportunity is very slim.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Blum Forms Pure Socialist Cabinet, One Says to Expand Cabinet Base, French President to Be Elected Early Next Year <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] Fortizio, Chief Secretary to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Orivo, told the press that if the various parties are unwilling to participate in the new cabinet, then Prime Minister Blum will form a pure Socialist cabinet so that the list of cabinet members can be submitted to the National Assembly the day after tomorrow. The Popular Republican Movement and the Leftist Assembly Movement are studying the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Blum. The success or failure of cabinet formation depends largely on the attitude of these two political parties. At 9:45 PM today, Blum met with representatives of the Popular Republican Movement, and then at 10:20 PM, he also met with representatives of the Leftist Assembly Movement. Afterwards, it was only learned that these two political parties will still hold meetings tonight to discuss, so the cabinet is still feared to not be formed by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The newly appointed Prime Minister Blum continued to consult with the leaders of various parties today on the formation of a cabinet. Blum himself intends to expand the government's base. In addition to the three major political parties, he will also recruit the Leftist Assembly Movement and right-wing political parties into the cabinet. However, the Communist Party believes that Blum's permission for right-wing parties to enter the cabinet is a major mistake. If Blum's proposal can be agreed upon by the various parties, a Minister of National Defense will be added, to be assumed by the Communist Party. As for the three ministers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, they will be assumed by the Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Independent Republican Party respectively. In addition, the Minister of Industrial Production will be divided into two departments: Industrial Production and Industrial Distribution. The Minister of Production will be assumed by the Communist Party, and the Minister of Distribution will belong to the Popular Republican Movement.

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] Six hundred and seventy American missionaries will embark on the transport ship "Sea Lynx" here today for various parts of the Far East. The transport ship also carries 300 passengers, all family members of American merchants in the Far East, and will dock at ports such as Manila, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, returning to the United States around February of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Far East International Tribunal Indicts Japanese Atrocities, Tojo and Others Bear Full Responsibility for Heinous Crimes <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Tokyo, 16th] When the Japanese war crimes tribunal continued to try former Prime Minister Tojo and his 26 accomplices today, the British prosecutor accused the Japanese wartime cabinet of bearing full responsibility for the massacre and mutilation of more than 100,000 people in Southeast Asia. At the same time, former Japanese Army Commander in Burma Kimura Heitaro should also bear the responsibility for executing Allied pilots captured by the Japanese army without trial. It is said that 25 percent of British civilians and military personnel captured by the Japanese army were killed or died of illness in detention.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] The Far East International Military Tribunal launched the final stage of indictment against Japanese war criminals today. Australian Frenchman Mansfield pointed out that Tojo and 12 others were directly responsible for Japanese atrocities against Allied prisoners of war, interned civilians, and people in Japanese-occupied areas. Mansfield said that similar abuses that occurred throughout the Japanese-occupied areas were not individual actions of Japanese officers and soldiers, but a general policy of the Japanese army and government. The prosecution will present evidence to prove that the Japanese army completely disregarded international law in the occupied areas. The Japanese have repeatedly stated that the treatment of prisoners of war will be carried out in accordance with the Japanese code of law, and prisoners of war have no rights. Mansfield listed the following as directly responsible for the atrocities besides Tojo: (1) Kimura, Vice Minister of the Army in Tojo's cabinet, (2) Muto, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, (3) Sato, former Chief of the Prisoner Management Section of the Military Affairs Bureau, (4) Togo, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, (5) Shigemitsu, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, (6) Nagano, former Commander of the Combined Fleet, (7) Shimada, former Minister of the Navy, (8) Utsu, former Commander of the Kwantung Army, (9) Potan, former Commander of the Japanese Army in the Singapore area, (10) Kanemitsu, Director of the Planning Bureau in Tojo's cabinet, (11) Oka, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The Supreme Struggle Committee of the General Federation of Employees' Unions of Japanese National Railways held a meeting in the conference room of the Ministry of Transportation this morning to discuss participating in the National Anti-Cabinet Congress and the winter living subsidy issue jointly with the National Council of Labor Unions of Government and Public Enterprises. As a result, it was decided to thoroughly participate in the joint struggle, establish joint struggle committees under the branches of each prefecture, and vigorously engage in joint struggle. It was also decided that trains, ships, factories, etc., would sound their whistles in unison at 10:00 AM on the day of the National Anti-Cabinet Congress.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] Japanese Socialist Party members in parliament have emphasized that Japan's economy will face a crisis in April of next year. State Minister Zen has also frankly admitted that this is based on inflation and rising prices. Because the Japanese government has submitted a supplementary budget of 5.2 billion yen for this year's extraordinary session of parliament, and there will be a huge additional budget of nearly 10 billion yen successively submitted, the total budget for this year will exceed the 70 billion yen mark.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The Tokyo police are planning to use wireless electricity to test whether the statements made by criminals are true during confidential interrogations. Because if a criminal tells a lie during interrogation, he will inevitably feel uneasy or his blood pressure circulation will change. The electrical current sensed by the machine from his body can detect that he is lying. Japan already had this design during the war and has now completed the testing. The police have ordered a batch of "criminal lie detectors" from wireless electricity manufacturing companies, and each branch will be equipped with one for interrogating criminals.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The President of the American Industrial Organizations Association, Morey, issued a statement recently, accusing the American Manufacturers Association and the American Chamber of Commerce of reactionary behavior, saying that the current surplus of merchants is the "plunder of postwar speculators," and demanded a comprehensive increase in wages in all industries. Well-informed sources close to the government expect that the largest strike wave in history is likely to occur soon. At the same time, the major labor unions of the Industrial Organizations Association in various parts of the United States are preparing to launch a second large-scale movement to demand wage increases.</p>

<h3 id="e97">80,000 Soviet Deserters Plan to Move to the Middle East, Unwilling to Be Sent Back to Their Country to Be Killed <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Istanbul, 14th Special Dispatch] Arrangements are now underway to allow 80,000 former Soviet Red Army soldiers to reside in Arab countries, or possibly allow them to reside in Turkey, in order to avoid the large-scale massacre of these Soviet soldiers. These 80,000 Red Army soldiers are currently residing in the American-occupied areas of Germany and Italy. During World War II, they volunteered to surrender to Germany due to their anti-Russian ideology, in order to engage in their historical struggle against Russian rule. Since the Bolsheviks gained victory, although the Caucasus has nominally established socialist republics, this anti-Russian struggle has never stopped. There were originally 400,000 of them in the Red Army. Since the end of the war, some of them have been repatriated to the Soviet Union, but they have all been massacred by the authorities on charges of treason. When the British and American planned to send the second batch of anti-Soviet soldiers back to the Soviet Union, they committed suicide in prison one after another, because they would rather commit suicide than return to the Soviet Union to be killed. The British and American military authorities believe that it is inhumane to send the remaining 80,000 Soviet troops back to the Soviet Union, so they agreed to find a way for them to settle in the Middle East. It is reported that the secret "Caucasus Independence Movement Committee," headquartered in a certain place in the Middle East, is working through the Arab League to extradite them to the Middle East. It is reported that King Farouk of Egypt and the Patriarch of Jerusalem are quite in favor of the British and American proposal, while Turkey has not yet decided its opinion, because if Turkey accepts the British and American proposal, it will make the already extremely dim Turkish-Soviet relations even worse. According to news obtained from the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities are relocating Caucasians to other regions of the Soviet Union in order to prevent them from engaging in more ethnic anti-Soviet movements. At the same time, they are relocating people from Belarus to the Caucasus to replenish the population there.</p>
<h3 id="e98">British Foreign Policy (Part 1) <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Authored by Professor Carr, Specially Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Office</p>
<p>In the past, Britain would only make decisions based on instinct after an emergency occurred, but now that times have changed, meticulous planning in advance is necessary.</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago, whenever the German ambassador complained to the British Foreign Office that he could not understand British foreign policy, the then Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as can be seen from his own records, always replied: "You should know that we have never formulated any foreign policy at all, but are doing something like making ends meet by moving things from the left hand to the right hand." The British never studied and planned in advance, but always relied on instinct to "improvise poetry" after an emergency occurred. This has long become a common boast of the British.</p>
<p>Lucky and wealthy people, in any case, do not have to rely on planning to live in the short term, can spend their resources carelessly, and apply their strength at will. The British Empire was extraordinarily lucky and wealthy in the nineteenth century, but today's Britain is absolutely not like that. In the current more difficult situation, we must use our resources sparingly and avoid wasting power in unnecessary situations. In short, we must plan our foreign policy with extreme prudence. In popular language, the word "planning" is usually applied more to economic events. However, the need for planning in politics, that is, the need for calculation in advance, is actually even greater than in economics.</p>
<p>Basic Points of British Foreign Policy</p>
<p>There are several fixed and unchanging foundations in British foreign policy, which will remain unchanged for a long time to come. One of them is Britain's geographical environment. We are too close to the European continent, which forces us to become part of it and to be Europeans, whether we like it or not. Another foundation is that Britain's natural resources are too scarce and its population is extremely excessive. She cannot survive without relying on foreign food, and her industry also partly relies on imported raw materials. This state is not absolutely unchangeable, but it has existed for more than a hundred years and will not change in any way for more than a hundred years to come. Therefore, this has become one of the many points that should be noted when considering British foreign policy. Since the food and raw materials we need cannot be obtained in Europe, British foreign policy must focus on other continents and pay attention to every continent in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. If I may say so, we must be ambidextrous, we must balance our policy between Europe and the overseas world, so that we can straddle the wall without falling to either side.</p>
<p>The above are the more fixed points in British foreign policy. At the same time, we must remember that many of the factors that have dominated British foreign policy in the past have changed, and have changed extremely drastically. If there is one cliché that is more correct than many others, then that cliché should be that we are living in a "changing world." In the changing world of the past fifty years, the change in the position of the British Empire has been even greater than the change in many other events. Less than fifty years ago, the great Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Salisbury, sang loudly that splendid isolation was the foundation of British foreign policy. But today, no one in the country wants a policy of isolation anymore. This fact does not explain whether isolation itself is good or bad, splendid or bleak. It only shows that Britain's position in the world has changed, and therefore her foreign policy must also change accordingly.</p>
<p>British Advantages are Shaken</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, far-sighted Britons had already begun to discover that the rosy British national fortune was changing. The competition from Germany and the United States seriously encroached on Britain's commercial advantages. In the production of steel (which is always an indicator of industry and commerce), Britain began to lag behind Germany and the United States; in the Far East and the Mediterranean, the edge of British maritime power appeared embarrassingly weak. The Boer War was a worrying symbol, and Germany's rise in Europe threatened the long-established balance of power on the continent. Britain was no longer strong enough to maintain splendid isolation. At the beginning of this century, she changed her traditional policy, finally concluding an alliance with Japan and establishing an "Entente Cordiale" with France. With the support of these allies, plus the strength of the United States, Britain then won the First World War. The victory brought a short-term illusion of power and security. Germany and Russia were as dim as eclipsed moons, the United States retreated into its shell, and Britain's advantages reappeared.</p>
<p>But these temporary phenomena were deceptive. In fact, the First World War accelerated the decline of Britain's relative power as a world power. We only need to look at one or two more obvious examples: First, Britain had enjoyed special benefits in controlling sea power due to her position isolated from the continent and her global commerce, but now air power is at least as important as naval power. And in aviation, Britain has no advantageous natural conditions, and even has shortcomings in natural conditions. A mere island is really not enough to encourage the development of large-scale inland air transport. Second, among the various major fuels used in combat, oil has replaced coal. The benefits that Britain, as a major coal-producing country, had enjoyed have been taken over by major oil-producing countries. Third, the First World War stimulated the industrial development of many countries, thereby further undermining Britain's economic advantages. Since 1918, the United States has replaced Britain's historically first trading nation in the world.</p>
<p>Weaker Despite Victory</p>
<p>Britain, like in the First World War, has won the Second World War, but in essence has become weaker, especially in contrast to the world powers, which is very obvious. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, even in the later 1920s, we could still believe that if Britain needed allies, she would always be in a position to choose friends, and could more or less proactively stipulate some conditions in the alliance, with other countries needing Britain more than Britain needed other countries. It is doubtful whether this is still the case today. At present, Britain is looking for allies in a world dominated by countries that are far more powerful than itself in terms of population and resources. This is the dramatic change that has taken place in recent years in the 1950s, and the foreign policy that Britain will set is to be implemented in this era. Perhaps someone would like to point out to me at this point that foreign policy is not just about power, and that moral factors should also be taken into consideration when making decisions, and that British foreign policy must be based on certain moral conditions, and so on. Apart from some other reasons, and feeling that morality is also one of the elements that constitutes power, I very much agree with these views. Power requires the people to be willing to unite and act in a certain way at a certain time for a certain event. If this event cannot inspire people to have faith that is worth fighting for, then the above situation will never form. I will elaborate on this point in later speeches.</p>
<p>Of course, the material basis of power is also the main component of foreign policy. Without fuel, no machine can move. Power is the fuel that enables political institutions to function. I dare not say whether we made the mistake between the two world wars of trying to drive ships without coal. We made many high-sounding protests about what Japan did in China, without thinking about what we could and would do about it. The United States made the same mistake as us on this point. I hope that you will not regard me as a great Confucian or a pessimist. I want to say very formally that one of the most important tasks of foreign policy decision-making is to "cut the feet to fit the shoes." Do not overestimate what we can do or should do, arrange world affairs according to what we like, and should not engage in work that we reasonably hope to be successful.</p>

<h3 id="e99">City Tax Revenue Improves; Winter Construction Donation Reduced; Reduced by One-Third Based on the Original Autumn Amount; Important Resolution of the City Council Last Night <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Finance Committee and Budget Committee of the City Council held their first joint meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday on the 12th floor of the Wing On New Building. The meeting was attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang, and councilors Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Shi Yongzong, He Yuanming, Qu Xi, and 26 others. Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan, and Accounting Director Min Xiangfan were also present. Speaker Pan served as chairman. During the meeting, Director Gu reported three points: (1) The city government may be able to automatically reduce or waive the winter municipal construction donation, which was originally scheduled to be doubled compared to the autumn amount. (2) The tax revenue situation has improved. As of the end of November, entertainment, inn, banquet, business, and slaughter taxes have increased by more than 6 billion compared to the budget. (3) Under the budget figure of 18 billion yuan for autumn and winter municipal construction donations, if the winter tax revenue is collected according to the autumn tax amount, it may exceed this figure. Therefore, based on this calculation, the winter tax revenue can be reduced by 2.5 billion yuan. The attending councilors stated that the City Council has recently received letters from citizens complaining that the tax amount is too high and unaffordable. Now that the tax revenue of the Finance Bureau has improved and it is estimated that the winter municipal construction donation can still be reduced, it was decided after intense discussion that "the winter municipal construction donation should not be collected at double the autumn tax amount, and should be collected at one-third less than the original autumn tax amount," in order to meet the people's expectations. The directors immediately expressed their willingness to submit this case to Mayor Wu for approval, but stated that they reserved the point that the budget for next year is difficult to be optimistic, and if the tax revenue situation next year is not good, then the doubled amount that has been approved for this winter should still be collected to make up for it.</p>
<p>Also, during the meeting, Councilor Xu Yongzuo reported that the final accounts for the 34th year of the Republic of China had begun to be audited, paying attention to three points: (1) Whether the final accounts are consistent with the budget, (2) Checking whether the revenue and expenditure figures are legal, (3) Whether the figures are in line with economic principles.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The City Government's budget for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic of China was previously reviewed by the City Council. As a result, there were some items that needed to be increased or decreased, so it was handed over to the City Government for recompilation. It has now been recompiled by the City Government. Compared with the original compilation after the recompilation, the bureaus and offices that have increased funding include: the City Council by 100 million yuan, and the Social Affairs Bureau by 840 million yuan. The funding for other bureaus and offices, such as education, public works, public utilities, health, police, finance, land administration, and civil affairs civil servant subsidies, have been reduced. In total, the original compiled total amount was more than 84.7 billion yuan, and the recompiled amount is more than 75.4 billion yuan, a reduction of more than 9.2 billion yuan. At the same time, the number of personnel increased by 421.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the report on the actual revenue and expenditure figures of the City Finance Bureau, from July to November, the total revenue was more than 36.1 billion yuan, and the total expenditure was more than 47.3 billion yuan, a difference of more than 11.1 billion yuan.</p>

<p>The Public Works Committee of this City Council held its fifth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Nine councilors attended, with Lu Yinchu as the chairman.

<h3 id="e102">Relief for Unemployed Workers: 30,000 Bags of Flour Distributed Before the New Year <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, relevant agencies held a meeting to provide relief to unemployed workers, and decided to use the remaining 30,000 bags of flour from the Unemployed Workers Assistance Association for special relief. All workers who have been unemployed for more than half a year and have three or more direct family members can register with the Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee for application after obtaining certification from the district office. This relief work is scheduled to be completed before the Lunar New Year, and each person can get two bags of flour. In addition, the committee deeply felt the shortage of relief funds and that the small amount of money was difficult to cope with. Therefore, it was decided to hold a symposium in the near future, inviting people from all walks of life to visit, in order to obtain social sympathy and assistance, and raise huge sums of money to carry out active relief work. As for the main points of yesterday's meeting, Deputy Director Li informed us as follows:</p>
<p>Few People and Little Money in the Reception Center</p>
<p>(1) The reception center for unemployed workers from the rear is located in a part of the Public University Yarn Factory. It was originally planned to accommodate 1,050 people, but in fact, it has now accommodated more than 1,800 people, resulting in poor environmental hygiene. Twenty people died of illness in mid-November. The nutrition of the workers is also insufficient, because in the past, the daily vegetable money was only 100 yuan. It was previously requested to increase it to 200 yuan, but it was not approved. The monthly funding for the reception center is only 3.5 million, but the actual expenditure is more than 10 million; and the funding for November and December has not yet been issued. In addition, there are 111 returned overseas workers, who are currently accommodated in the Sacred Heart Hospital. The Sacred Heart Hospital still has spare rooms for accommodating unemployed workers, but they still need to be repaired. The Wood Association decided to submit the current situation, improvement measures, and budget of the workers' reception center to Mayor Wu within two days, hoping to be approved as soon as possible. As for the improvement of medical and health care in the reception center, the former Health Bureau has sent personnel to inspect it. The Wood Association is now resolved to ask the Health Bureau and the Chinese Labor Association to assist in the handling.</p>
<p>More Than 60,000 Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the relief of general unemployed workers, a total of 80,000 unemployed workers applied for relief in the spring. It is estimated that no more than one-tenth of them have been re-employed. Currently, there are more than 60,000 unemployed workers in this city. Due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce, there is currently no hope for factories to accommodate unemployed workers, and the opening of cooperative factories is also impossible in the short term. As for the holding of small loans, the central government has also agreed in principle, so the reason why Mi is being handled is that one is the large number, such as lending 300,000 to each person, 60,000 people need 90 billion; the second is that the use of loans is difficult to choose, and small wood operations can only set up stalls, but it is not the time to promote this type of business, so small loans have not been handled to Song. The best relief method is to replace relief with work, but the municipal government does not have this amount of funding to hold. In summary, the relief of unemployed workers must be initiated by social forces in order to be effective. According to relevant personnel, the most miserable situation among unemployed workers is often attributed to workers from the rear who came to Shanghai. Among the 2,400 who entered, only more than 300 have been employed so far. They are technicians in the ordnance factory, and the training time requires five years. They served the country for several years, but ended up unemployed after the victory. Therefore, in future relief work, they should have priority rights.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Income Tax for Public and Education Personnel Will Be Levied According to Base Salary <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the collection of income tax for public and education personnel, the Ministry of Finance has decided to levy tax according to the base salary in accordance with the revised tax law promulgated on April 16, 34th year of the Republic of China. However, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has not yet received this official order.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Kerosene Prices May Tend to Stabilize; Companies Prevent Black Market by Directly Retailing; The Reason for Shortages is Due to Low Import Quotas <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] A representative of a major kerosene company once made a public statement: accusing that the current lack of kerosene is due to the kerosene quota being too low. It is said that the current kerosene import quota is still based on the consumption before the war, and does not take into account the new needs after the war. However, kerosene was only used for lighting before the war, but today coal is scarce and the prices of other fuels are high, so almost everyone uses kerosene for cooking in the kitchen and heating in winter, resulting in the need exceeding that before the war. Only by revising the new import quota that is in line with the actual situation can the phenomenon of kerosene shortage be alleviated. And because supply and demand cannot be balanced, the black market price of kerosene has risen to 800 yuan per catty. In order to prevent black market transactions, the oil companies discussed and decided to directly retail a small amount of oil to consumers. A major company established a retail organization yesterday to supply citizens at parity prices. According to Zizi, the kerosene stock in this city is sufficient, but due to the lack of coal, the need for kerosene consumption has suddenly increased, resulting in temporary black market sales. Now, the companies have adopted the method of direct retail, and intermediate merchants have no way to take advantage of it. It is expected that the kerosene price will be able to stabilize in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Book Industry Held a General Meeting Yesterday; Firmly Requesting Exemption from Business Tax; Elected 20 Representatives to Petition in Beijing Again; And Discussed the Issue of Profit Tax <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Last month, the 286 bookstores in Shanghai elected 17 representatives to petition in Beijing, requesting the Ministry of Finance to exempt the book industry from business tax. At that time, Minister Yu Hongjun expressed sympathy and was waiting for orders. Unexpectedly, recently the book industry association received a letter from the Ministry of Education transferring a letter from the Ministry of Finance, only allowing nationally designated and reviewed textbooks to be exempted from business tax, and other books must still be taxed uniformly. The entire book industry in the city was greatly confused upon hearing this news, and the group was in distress. For the sake of caution, the association specially convened a temporary general meeting of all members at the Huzhe Society on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 200 representatives from bookstores across the city were present, with Li Bojia, Ye Suzhong, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Boxin, Guo Nongshan, and Zhou Xihe as the presidium, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau Dui Guangjia, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yan Gesheng, and the Police Bureau Wu Youkang attended to provide guidance. First, the chairman of the conference, Li Bojia, reported the reason for the meeting, and then the Social Affairs Bureau Feng Guangjia gave a speech expressing sympathy. Then, representatives from various industries, such as Xu Qitang, Wang Mengzou, Yao Pengzi, Chu Wei, Song Liangrui, Wang Zhicheng, and Jiang Zhenzhan, expressed their opinions one after another. Qian believed that the book industry's request for exemption from business tax was in line with the government's main purpose of helping to develop cultural undertakings. Textbooks and other books are both cultural tools. Textbooks should be exempted from tax, and other books should also be exempted from tax. There must be no discrimination. It was unanimously advocated that representatives be sent to Beijing again to petition, and at the same time, telegrams should be sent to the national industry to respond in unison and strive for it together. If the goal is not achieved, the entire book industry in Shanghai will only have one way to automatically close down, and the emotions are extremely intense. After discussion and resolution, in addition to sending telegrams to the country's industry, Xu Qitang, Chu Wei, Wang Mengzou, and other 20 people were elected to go to Beijing on a set date to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Direct Tax Bureau separately. Then, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yan Gesheng, expressed his opinions, blaming the book industry's request for exemption from business tax as a legitimate way for the country to build culture. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already resolved to exempt the tax on file. At the very least, the municipal government should respect the resolution of the council, and first exempt the book industry in Shanghai from 70% of the business tax. The central government's '30% should be asked to the central government for a ruling again. It is thought that the central government will not adhere to the previous discussion and make the daytime industry tend to be passive in supporting culture, etc. Finally, member Jiang Zhenzhan made a temporary motion that the profit tax in the 34th year of the Republic of China was extremely unfair. Our book industry should pay a total of more than 60 million yuan, and the three companies Yongxiang, Children's, and Longmen have to pay more than 30 million yuan, exceeding half of the number. The problem is serious and the conference should be asked to resolve it. At that time, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yan Gesheng, dissected it and expressed sympathy for the adjustment. It was decided that a special committee of the association would discuss and adjust it to achieve a fair and reasonable solution. The meeting adjourned at 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Enemy Property Administration Bureau Will End at the End of the Year; The Reorganization Method is Being Carefully Considered <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Enemy Puppet Industry Administration Bureau has previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to end at the end of this year. Last weekend, the directors of the offices of the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Administration Bureau were invited by Mr. Liu Gongyun to hold a meeting in Shanghai to discuss the ending and reorganization methods. At that time, no specific decision was obtained. The written opinions from all parties will be summarized again, and detailed methods will be formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is learned that after the Administration Bureau ends, a "Enemy Puppet Industry Clearing Office" will be established in the Central Trust Bureau. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the original personnel in the Administration Bureau will be dismissed. The issue of the re-employment of the dismissed personnel will be introduced to other agencies as appropriate. The dismissal fee will be three months in accordance with central regulations. The Reverse Property Handling Committee will continue to exist. As for the transfer of reverse property to local financial authorities for management, there are difficulties. The Administration Bureau plans to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions again.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, no official order has been received regarding the merger of the Administration Bureau into the bureau. As for what kind of organization should be established to be responsible for handling the unfinished pending cases of the Administration Bureau, and how the handover method should be, the bureau is carefully considering it.</p>
<p>According to general observation, it is considered that there are difficulties in incorporating the Administration Bureau into the Trust Bureau. Because the Trust Bureau is national, while the Administration Bureau is a district system, and the district regulations are quite inconsistent, and it is inevitable that there will be inconveniences in the merger.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The disposal measures for the so-called "bad officers and soldiers" who were detained by the British side in Burma and sent back have been specifically decided after discussions between the representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Garrison Command, and the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in recent days, and will be implemented within days.

Those who are poor and helpless will be relieved by relevant agencies and sent back to their hometowns. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other three agencies will jointly issue a statement on this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Municipal Fishery Association Cables Grain Department Requesting Grain Transport Permits <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Since its reorganization and establishment, the Municipal Fishery Association has spared no effort in its work, particularly concerning the livelihoods of fishermen. As most of the city's seafood comes from the islands of Shengsi and Zhoushan, where arable land is scarce, the fishermen's grain supply has traditionally been provided by seafood merchants who exchange rice for fish, a convenient arrangement for both parties. However, the rice used by these merchants is mainly purchased in this city, and the recent ban on rice exports by the municipal authorities has made it impossible to transport the grain, severely affecting the fishery industry and the livelihood of the people. The association cabled the Grain Department yesterday, requesting permission to issue transport permits or to allow the association to issue certificates for export, in order to facilitate the fishing industry and maintain the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Police Dogs Demonstrate Skills: Carrying Opium Has Nowhere to Escape <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] A reporter recently accompanied Mr. Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau, to inspect the opium detoxification work at the Huade Road Police Hospital and to observe police dogs detecting smuggled opium.</p>
<p>Approximately forty opium addicts, both men and women, were undergoing detoxification at the hospital. Most were registered addicts who had voluntarily entered the hospital, and as a result, most had already quit and had a healthy complexion.</p>
<p>To detect opium smuggling, the hospital keeps two specially trained police dogs, both left behind by the former Japanese. One, named "Wu Pei," demonstrated its search capabilities on the spot. An opium pipe was hidden in the inner pocket of a reporter present, and "Wu Pei" was instructed to find it. The police dog sniffed around the people present and, upon discovery, barked wildly at the reporter and retrieved the opium pipe from the pocket. In this way, smugglers of opium will have difficulty escaping the law.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Final Stage of Opium Eradication: Extreme Penalty for All Starting New Year's Day <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the first day of the city's expanded publicity week for opium eradication. The Municipal Government hosted the city's press at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:30 PM. Mayor Wu Guozhen was attending a financial conference convened by President Song and was represented by Secretary-General He Dekui. First, Mr. Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau, reported on the city's opium suppression work, which is being carried out in three phases. It has now been decided that a general inspection of opium addicts will be conducted starting on January 1st next year. At that time, those who have not undergone detoxification will be treated as relapse offenders and subject to the extreme penalty.</p>
<p>Director Fang then reported on the organization and facilities of the opium detoxification center, the detoxification procedures, and the actual work. He stated that since its establishment on May 1st of this year, the center has detoxified a total of 2,898 opium addicts, of whom 2,006 were self-registered and 892 were opium offenders arrested after being reported. The detoxification results showed that 605 were addicted and 2,293 were not addicted.</p>
<p>Director Fang continued: Starting today, the Civil Affairs Bureau will launch publicity efforts in various Baojia, the Education Bureau will order all primary and secondary schools to fully cooperate in the anti-opium campaign, and the Social Affairs Bureau will order all movie theaters in the city to show anti-opium lantern slides, in order to gather collective wisdom and prevent the city from being as filled with opium smoke as in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Xuehai, Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Jiangsu Province, then spoke, believing that the promotion of opium eradication in Shanghai is more difficult than in other places due to the special circumstances. This is evidenced by the recent police report on suicide figures for this year, in which more than half of the 800 deaths were due to opium poisoning, indicating that the opium suppression work is not thorough enough and that opium is too easily obtained. Liu also emphasized the government's determination to eradicate opium, stating "no tolerance, no relaxation, no compromise." Mayor Wu's recent decision to increase the reward for reporting opium offenders by 50,000,000 yuan is also aimed at thoroughly realizing opium eradication.</p>

Zhang Xiaosong and Wang Zhuyi also praised Zhong's efforts to help the world and save people. It is reported that Zhong's friends are raising funds to establish a Ketuo Primary and Secondary School, and all the condolence money will be used as the school's foundation.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Due to the recent inclement weather and difficult navigation conditions, the Shanghai-Ningbo Qianda Hua Steamer has been delayed. The originally scheduled sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 15th finally departed yesterday. The next sailing is scheduled for tomorrow from Shanghai to Ningbo. The China Merchants Bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo Jiang Ya Steamer, which was suspended for boiler repairs last week, has been completed and resumed its voyage to Ningbo yesterday.

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] At around 9:00 PM last night, two thugs wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers and raincoats suddenly appeared at the Fuxinglong Flour Shop at No. 50 Huaiji Street, Xizang South Road. They claimed to want to buy two bags of flour, and the shop owner, Wu Yueyang, 26 years old, from Tianjin, went to serve them. Unexpectedly, one of them changed his tone and said that he had come to borrow 5,000,000 yuan in legal tender due to financial difficulties. Wu sensed danger and was about to turn back when he was shot in the chest and fell to the ground. The thugs then fled. Neighbors discovered the incident and quickly called an ambulance to take Wu to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger due to the severity of the injury. The case is currently being investigated by the police, and it is possible that it was a revenge killing.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Special Report] The General Xiafei transported Archbishop Li Boli, the first apostolic delegate to China. Today at noon, our country's ambassador to the Vatican, Dr. Wu Jingxiong, will take the "General Xiafei" to Europe to assume his post. In about a month, he can arrive at the solemn and holy Vatican Palace.</p>
<p>Harboring Ancient Sorrows, Containing Eternal Joys</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wu published a very elegant written statement at his Shanghai residence. He said: "In my heart, I often harbor ancient sorrows and contain eternal joys. Therefore, in the most difficult times, there is still great comfort; and in the most joyful times, there is still great sorrow. I feel that my heart is in complete harmony with God; I feel even more uneasy for my compatriots who have not yet reached this state. If there is a day when I do not reach the state of harmony between man and God, there will be a sense of regret. According to my experience, I always feel that the joy of life is directly proportional to the degree of union with God. Those who are not in union with God are the source of all suffering; those who are in union with God are the source of all true joy. Therefore, while I am seeking happiness for myself, I am deeply moved to see others still in pain. Those who believe in God take the sacred heart of Jesus as their own; the sacred heart of Jesus is the compassion for all people. If there is one person or one thing in the world that is not in its proper place, I feel that I am not in my proper place. Those who believe in religion have a deeper degree of happiness than ordinary people; and the scope of pain is also wider than usual. Believing in religion means bearing the cross. Moreover, the two meanings of "freedom" and "obedience" seem to be contradictory; but in religious life, they are integrated into one. The more one obeys God's will, the more freedom one feels. All unfreedom comes from human desires. If one can eliminate human desires and preserve heavenly principles, one will have the freedom of "fish leaping from the customs gate and birds flying freely in the sky." The source of the world's chaos lies in misunderstanding the true meaning of freedom. People usually think that satisfying human desires is freedom; in fact, the stronger human desires are, the more they are slaves to the three enemies: the flesh, the world, and the devil. The so-called "standing upright between heaven and earth" must first mean connecting with heaven before standing on earth. If not, where will one find a foothold? The process of developing spiritual life can be divided into three movements: first, non-detachment (Attachment), which means "following the crowd"; second, detachment (Detachment), which means "being independent"; third, from detachment, one must still embrace compassion, which means "sacrificing oneself for others." It is most difficult to enter the third stage from the second stage. This is what I want to share with the world."</p>
<p>Visiting in the Rain, Guests Gathered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited Ambassador Wu in the rain. It so happened that Ambassador Wu was hosting a private lunch for Archbishop Li Boli and many Catholic celebrities. Many believers knelt down and bowed to the Archbishop. Ambassador Wu, wearing a blue robe and holding a seven- or eight-inch ivory cigarette holder in his hand, circulated among the guests in high spirits.</p>
<p>In Ambassador Wu's study, I saw Mr. Yao Xinong. On the desk was a piece of white paper with the words "One World Under Heaven" written in large ink strokes by Mr. Quan Zengshe, followed by the names of many guests as a farewell memento. The walls were lined with bookshelves filled with books, mostly on law, religion, and literature, and quite a few old thread-bound books. Occasionally, a few new Western magazines were scattered on top of the neatly arranged sets of books. If it is said that one can see a person's character from their collection of books, then one can see how erudite Wu is from these books.</p>
<p>Wu's Party Consisted of Sixteen People</p>
<p>This time, Wu's party consisted of sixteen people. In addition to Wu and his wife, Ms. Li Delan, there were twelve of Wu's sons and daughters and one of Wu's daughters-in-law. Wu is forty-eight years old this year and married at the age of eighteen. To date, he has thirteen sons and daughters, nine sons and four daughters. The eldest is twenty-nine years old, and the youngest is six years old. This time, only the eldest son, Zulin, stayed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I asked Wu what he thought of the progress of the constitutional draft discussion. Wu thought for a while and said, "I have been busy preparing to go abroad these days, so I am not very clear about the progress of the discussion, but I guess it will not undergo major revisions and can be passed."</p>
<p>Talking about the work of retranslating the Bible, Wu told me that in addition to the "Psalms" in the Old Testament, which has been translated and published as "Translation of the Psalms", the first draft of the New Testament has also been completed, and it is translated in classical Chinese. He said modestly that he wanted to go abroad to see some of the works on translating the Bible in various countries. In addition, he plans to translate some other Biblical literature.</p>
<p>Tianxia Monthly is Difficult to Republish</p>
<p>I asked about the "Tianxia" monthly magazine, which everyone is very concerned about. Mr. Yao Xinong said that it is really not easy to republish in the current environment. I suggested that Ambassador Wu collect and publish many of his insightful essays that he had previously published in "Tianxia". Wu said: "Really, there are quite a few articles to collect, and it is indeed possible to publish a collection."</p>
<p>From the fact that "Tianxia" cannot be republished, we can see the low level of cultural standards in Shanghai. When this collection comes out, perhaps it can slightly satisfy the thirst of countless readers? Italy is a beautiful country that evokes a sense of nostalgia. We deeply hope that Ambassador Wu will give us more beautiful and refined essays in his spare time!</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing last weekend, President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen went to the Central Bank Building at around 8:00 AM yesterday to handle official business.

Later, Minister of Finance Yu Jingjun, Shi Cici, Xu Baiwei, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Textile Construction Company Shu Yunzhang, and Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau Lou Guowei visited him successively. At 12:00 PM, Song convened a meeting that lasted for three quarters of an hour. It is reported that the important content of the meeting was to study the national tax system and the income from the government's newly issued tax rates, and it also involved the general situation of the national financial economy and production industry. Song was extremely concerned about the above points and listened to reports from all parties in detail during the meeting, and solicited opinions. After the meeting, Song also met with City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Local Association President Du Yuesheng, and Senator Shi Yonggeng, to discuss matters.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of opening the US cotton exchange, at 4:00 PM yesterday, President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen specially convened a meeting of relevant personnel in the Central Bank Building, attended by Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Mayor Wu Guozhen, President of the Central Bank Bei Yi, and General Manager of the Textile Construction Company Shu Yunzhang. The meeting lasted for three hours. After the meeting, Song also met with Song Yixin, Deputy Manager of Taiwan Industry Company, to inquire about the recent sugar prices and supply situation in the city.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications now sends 1,600 to 1,700 telegrams abroad every day, of which 40% are sent to the United States, 20% to Hong Kong, and 10% to London; the rest are sent to other parts of the world. Because it is difficult to add equipment, the expansion of trunk roads is also relatively slow. Recently, it is planning to open a South American route and prepare to communicate with the capitals of Argentina and Peru. At the same time, it has ordered powerful transmitters, receivers, and teleprinters from abroad to increase reception and transmission efficiency.</p>
<p>As of recently, Shanghai International Radio has resumed the following circuits: Geneva, Los Angeles, Manila, London, Macau, Hong Kong, Columbus, Paris, Saigon, Bangkok, Moscow, Irkutsk, Sydney, and Mumbai. It is expected to expand 38 telegraph circuits, including 15 Asian circuits, 9 North and South American circuits, 10 European circuits, and 2 African and Australian circuits each.</p>
<p>Like major radio stations in the world, the International Radio Station also adopts a remote control system, with the central control room, transmitting station, and receiving station set up in three places. The central control room of the International Radio Station is located on the second floor of the Sassoon Building and is equipped with six German-made transmitters and eight receivers; three American-made transmitters and four receivers; and one French-made transmitter and receiver each. The transmitting station is located in Zhenru, covering an area of approximately 250 mu, and the receiving station is located in Zhabei, also covering an area of approximately 250 mu. The equipment is made in the United States, Britain, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to telegrams, the International Radio Station is also planning to add world broadcasting and international telephone services, and is first preparing to test calls with the United States and Britain. In order to meet international needs, it is also actively preparing to open wireless facsimile between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom. But what the result will be depends on equipment and talent. Equipment is originally scarce, and talent is often poached by other organizations because the salaries are too low (the International Radio Station is based on civil servant salaries). Only when these two problems are solved can all plans be realized!</p>

<p>The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs was established in Chongqing in 1940, aiming to strengthen the business of production and consumer cooperatives at all levels, and achieved considerable results. After the victory, it returned to the east with the National Government and re-established the national cooperative supply and marketing network. It has successively established six branch offices in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, and three offices in Anqing, Taiwan, and Beiping. Since Mr. Chen Zhongming took over the office in October of this year, he decided to move the headquarters from Nanjing to Shanghai, because he felt that it would be better to develop the business in Shanghai. He also added an office in Nanjing to facilitate communication. Now, in order to review the past work situation, adapt to the current situation of domestic and foreign trade, and establish the cooperative supply and marketing business policy, following the office's own business meeting on the previous two days. Today, it convened a National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Business Conference in the meeting room of the YMCA on Sichuan Middle Road. Representatives from 25 provincial and municipal cooperative supply and marketing offices and unions in Hankou, Tianjin, Gansu, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, Sichuan, Henan, Qingdao, and Taiwan participated. The estimated agenda is as follows: the opening ceremony will be held this morning, followed by business reports this afternoon; the proposals will be reviewed on the morning of the 18th, followed by discussions in the afternoon; and discussions will continue all day on the 19th before the closing ceremony.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yao Lengshi, a woman at No. 34 Huaxing Road, Zhabei, has an affair with Ma Lishan, who is a rogue and often extorts money from her, which is unbearable. Around Double Ten Day this year, Ma borrowed 1,000,000 yuan from his friend Xue Funeng, stating that it would be repaid within one month. Unexpectedly, when it was due on November 10, Ma was unable to repay it. He discussed it with Yao, and Yao signed a check to extend the deadline for another month. Who knew that when it was due on the 10th of this month, Yao was also unable to repay it, so it was delayed. A few days later, Yao's five-year-old child, Youqing, suddenly went missing, and all searches were unsuccessful. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yao went to her son's maternal grandmother's house on Luxiangyuan Road in the city and met Xue Fulong on the way. She talked about her son Youqing's disappearance and asked him to pay attention to finding him. Xue readily agreed on the spot and asked Yao to issue a letter of authorization, stating that if he could find the child, she would reward him with 1,000,000 yuan, and he would also bear the 1,000,000 yuan that Ma Lishan owed before, totaling 2,000,000 yuan. At that time, Yao was eager to find her son and agreed. They then separated. On the 14th, Yao suddenly received a letter, roughly stating that if she wanted her son, she should meet him at the entrance of the North Railway Station Boundary Road Post Office at 10:00 AM tomorrow. When she went there, she saw Xue there and went up to talk to him. He replied that she must pay first before she could get her son back. When Yao heard this, she knew that there must be a reason, so she called the police and arrested him at the North Station Sub-bureau. According to his confession, he did not abduct the child, but Ma Lishan did, and he revealed the location where he was hiding. Director He of the sub-bureau ordered Section Chief Ding to lead the police to a house on Binlang Road, the home of Ma's sister, Xing Ma, and rescued the child. Ma Lishan, Xing Ma, and others were taken to the sub-bureau to await transfer.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Newspaper and Magazine Inventory and Recertification: Ministry of Interior Sets Four Measures <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Interior stated that newly opened newspapers and magazines that have been approved for registration in various places have been greatly changed due to migration and twists and turns due to the anti-Japanese war. In addition, the registration certificates issued by the Ministry of Interior during the war were limited to material resources, and the paper quality may be inferior, making it difficult to last for a long time. Now that culture is being restored, it is necessary to conduct an inventory and reissue new certificates to protect their distribution and understand the actual distribution situation. The following four measures have been specified for the inventory and recertification: (1) All newspapers and magazines that were approved for registration and given certificates before July 1946 and are still being published shall be required to exchange them for new registration certificates. (2) To exchange for new registration certificates, each newspaper and magazine shall submit the original registration certificate together with a copy of the most recent publication of the newspaper or magazine to the local competent authority for transfer to the Ministry for processing. (3) Local competent authorities and provincial and municipal governments shall handle cases of exchanging registration certificates as they arrive. After sending them to the Ministry for issuing new certificates, they shall be quickly transferred to facilitate distribution. (4) Newspapers and magazines that have been approved for registration and given certificates, but have exceeded the publication date stipulated in the Publication Law and have not yet been published, shall be responsible for investigating and verifying the facts by the local competent authority, and submit the original registration certificates for transfer to the Ministry for cancellation.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Police officer No. 471 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, on the morning of the 15th at 3:30 AM, drove a free bicycle from the police station to the 29th district to take over the 3:00 to 7:00 AM shift. When the car passed the west side of Dede Primary School on Huashan Road, he saw three people coming towards him. One was wearing a brown raincoat, one was wearing a black overcoat, and the identity of the other was unknown. They were carrying a leather bag, a suitcase, and a woman's overcoat, and their behavior was suspicious. He immediately drove to the patrol station in the 29th Joint Management District and, together with police officer No. 680, went to order them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the person wearing the black overcoat took out a gun and fired one shot, and the three fled into the alley and escaped in the direction of the Zhu Family Warehouse. The police officers returned fire and chased after them. When they reached the turn at the Zhu Family Warehouse, police officer No. 680 fired another shot, which seemed to have hit one of them in the foot. But they immediately disappeared. Later, they searched two or three lanes and saw a few drops of blood on the ground with a flashlight, and a suitcase that had been thrown down. When opened, it was empty, with only four photos. On the back of one of the photos were the numbers "Fan Huaqing, No. 14, 10th Jia, 1st Lianbao, 3rd Fang, Huxi." At dawn, the police ordered the police to search the joint management areas of the 8th, 9th, and 13th districts, but found nothing. They also sent personnel to the major hospitals to inquire, but found nothing.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Missing Plane Crashed in Changxing; All Crew and Passengers Killed; Central Air Transport Corporation Received Urgent Telegram from Changxing County Government; Personnel Dispatched Overnight to Investigate and Handle Aftermath <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane No. 31, which went missing on the 14th of this month en route from Nanjing to Shanghai, was found yesterday within the territory of Changxing County, Zhejiang Province. Both the plane and all personnel were destroyed. It is not yet known whether the thirty-one boxes of banknotes on board were burned. The Central Air Transport Corporation received an urgent telegram from the Changxing County government at 4:30 PM and dispatched personnel overnight to the accident site to investigate the details and handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Plane No. 31, flying the Nanjing-Shanghai route, flew from Beijing to Nanjing on the 13th and then from Nanjing to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th, going missing forty-five minutes after takeoff. The plane carried thirty-one boxes of banknotes being transported from Beijing to Shanghai. In addition to the pilot, co-pilot Ma, Xiang, Zhang, Dong and the radio operator Zhong Da, there were also two passengers, Xue Jin and Zai Tianfang, who requested temporary passage from Beijing. As for the four passengers who boarded in Beijing and Jinan, it is understood that they disembarked in the two capitals, and did not continue the journey from Nanjing. After discovering that the plane was missing, the Central Air Transport Corporation dispatched planes for several days to search along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, including the Suzhou-Wuxi area, without finding any clues. It was not until yesterday afternoon, around 4:00 PM, that they suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Changxing County government. The original telegram stated: "Your company's air transport XP-26 crashed in Nongshan, our county, on the 14th at 17:00 hours, all personnel dead. Please advise on how to handle. Changxing County Government, Zhejiang (Telegram dated 16th)."</p>
<p>It did not mention whether the thirty-one boxes of banknotes on board (weighing 1,579 kilograms) were completely destroyed. It is understood that these banknotes were being transported to the Bank of China in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Note: Changxing is located southwest of Taihu Lake, an area with many mountains, approximately 40 kilometers north of Yixing and 90 kilometers east of Jiaxing. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was a hotspot for guerrilla activities. The cause of the accident is likely due to the adverse weather conditions on the day, with strong northeasterly winds causing the plane to deviate from its route and crash into the mountains.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to Director Liao Zhongshuang of the Nanjing station, the crash site of Central Air Transport Corporation plane No. 31 has been identified as a small mountain near Longhua Temple in Lijia Township, Changxing (the area is near Taihu Lake, north of Mogan Mountain), with both the plane and personnel destroyed. However, for verification purposes, further inquiries are still underway.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Social Affairs Bureau's mediation techniques for labor-management disputes have been improved after discussions at a meeting last Saturday. The key points are as follows: (1) The number of representatives from both labor and management will be limited to five: two official representatives and three observers. If the dispute has unique characteristics, such as involving an entire industry or the entire city, each side may have up to ten representatives. (2) If workers exhibit unreasonable behavior, they will be warned once. If they do not listen, mediation will be suspended. If it is still ineffective, the police will be asked to assist in maintaining order. (3) In the past, management representatives often repeatedly failed to attend mediation sessions. The Social Affairs Bureau now plans to stipulate that if they do not attend the third invitation, a decision will be made based on the labor side's opinion. This measure will be implemented after approval by Director Wu. In addition, there will be improved measures for the cleanliness and order of the mediation venue.</p>

<p>Du Gang's Wife Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Huang Liewen, the traitorous former Qingpu County Magistrate, committed numerous atrocities during his time in the puppet government. He also sold out Du Gang, a commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in an effort to curry favor with the enemy, leading to Du's brutal persecution by the Japanese military police. The case was re-examined by the High Court yesterday. At 9:00 AM, High Court President Liu Yugui and judges Qiu and Liang ascended the bench. The defendant was escorted to the criminal court by bailiffs. He claimed to be a 38-year-old native of Songjiang, who grew up in Shanghai. Before the war, he served as an instructor at the Nanjing Central Military Academy. He insisted he took on the position in the puppet government due to the circumstances at the time, maintaining close ties with the National Army and providing many conveniences to underground comrades. Du Gang's widow, Lu Huimin, testified that Du's martyrdom was indeed due to the defendant's betrayal. The court then adjourned the case for further hearing at a later date.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Huang Quanfu and Huang Quangui, the two brothers accused by Wang Haoran, were foremen at the Mitsubishi Wharf on the Huangpu River before the war. The charges against them include establishing the puppet Jiangnan Company, purchasing the Dapeng steamship, and leasing it to the enemy's Zhonghua Company. Huang Quangui also purchased the Nanfang steamship and leased it to the enemy's International Company. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The two defendants, one thin and one fat, vehemently denied the accusations. They claimed that the puppet Jiangnan Company was founded by the plaintiff, Wang Haoran, and presented a contract signed by Wang Haoran as evidence. They stated that the steamship was confiscated by the Japanese, not leased to them. They also filed a counter-suit accusing Wang Haoran of using the accusation of being a traitor to extort a large sum of money, which has been forwarded by the High Prosecutor's Office to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After arguments by the defendants' defense lawyers, Zhang Muping, Jiang Baoyan, and Cai Lin, the court adjourned the case for further hearing due to its complexity.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Bin, nicknamed "Pockmarked A-Gen," a native of Ningbo, was accused of joining Wu Shibao's organization as a special agent in May of the 29th year of the Republic, arresting underground workers. In July of the 31st year of the Republic, he was introduced by Zheng Qifeng of the Fujika Unit at No. 19 Zhaofeng Villa and transferred to the unit as an intelligence chief. He identified the plaintiff, Lu Xisheng, as a suspected member of the guerrilla forces, prompting the Japanese military police to detain him for several days before he was released. The defendant was later transferred to Pan Yuan's Special High Section of the puppet Shanghai Bureau in Huxi, where he relied on the power of the enemy and puppet government to protect gambling activities. Lu Xisheng and Zhu Rongbao filed lawsuits successively. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The defendant denied all the accusations. The court adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e137">New Location of the High Prosecutor's Office; Lu Ying's Former Residence; Tour of Chuyuan Garden <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai High Prosecutor's Office previously announced that it would move to No. 25 Jianguo Road, Chuyuan Garden, to conduct business. The reporter learned that the new office address has been fully prepared. Yesterday morning, in the face of impending rain, the reporter took a car to inspect the new bureau.</p>
<p>First, let's introduce the history of "Chuyuan Garden." This residence was built by Lu Ying, a notorious bigwig and deputy director of the puppet police bureau during the enemy-puppet era. It is located on the west side of Jianguo West Road (formerly Route Tenant de la Tour) and Zhongzheng South Second Road (formerly Rue Père Froc), facing north with a three-story Western-style house and a garden behind it. After Lu was arrested, he was imprisoned in the house. Several notorious major traitors, such as Liang Hongzhi, were also detained there, making "Chuyuan Garden" a "Chu prison." After the reporter handed in his name card, Chief Prosecutor Du Baoqi received him. Mr. Du, a native of Fujian, over fifty years old, mentioned that he has been feeling unwell recently due to being too busy with work. Mr. Du wore a casual hat and a gray cloth robe. His gentle manner and simple attire fully demonstrated his scholarly nature. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he asked Chief Secretary Xu Kaisu to lead the reporter on a tour of the premises. To the right of the entrance is the Receiving and Dispatch Office, the General Affairs Office, the Judicial Police Office, and the Waiting Room. The main hall is downstairs. Yesterday's memorial service for the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death was held there. The outer reception room is decorated with classical elegance, featuring mahogany tables and chairs and marble tabletops. Behind it are two interrogation rooms. The Chief Secretary's office, the inner reception room, and the Chief Prosecutor's office are on the second floor. The prosecutors' offices are on the third floor. The layout is orderly. The reporter stood in front of the window in the inner reception room, looking at a square military field outside with an air raid shelter in the middle, shaped like a tomb. Surrounded by bald trees and leaden clouds, it evoked a sense of desolation and austerity. Imagining the bustling scene of Lu Ying's past glory, the reporter couldn't help but sigh, "For whose sake are they toiling so hard?"</p>
<p>The reporter spoke at length with Chief Secretary Xu. He told me that in addition to Chief Prosecutor Du Baoqi, there are also prosecutors Lin Wopeng, Dai Rongduo, Sun Xiangrong, Liu Yanhong, Qu Rong, Ye Yushao, Xia Luli, Chen Siyong, and Lin Houqi, a total of nine prosecutors. Even with so many prosecutors, they are still overwhelmed with work. The High Prosecutor's Office's previous office on West Esson Road and the temporary office attached to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison were both closed yesterday and moved to the new location. Subsequently, prisoners who are under investigation will be sent to the Masnan Road Detention Center for convenience in the investigation. The original office on West Esson Road will be converted into the High Prosecutor's Office's storage room.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the High Court delivered verdicts in three suspected traitor cases: (1) Ling Guangyan graduated from Zhizhi University in his early years, studied commercial law in France, and married a Japanese woman. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the puppet organization and held various military and political positions, including the major general brigade commander of the puppet Second Army, for six years. He also opened the "Dafa Company" in Lu'an and established a "comfort station." The High Court previously sentenced him to twelve years in prison. Ling appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. The case was heard in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court on the 9th of this month. Yesterday morning, the sentence was changed to eight years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for eight years. (2) The Portuguese national Nakamura Remedios, whose mother is Japanese, purchased 150 tons of gasoline for the Japanese Nakamura Tani Yoshi during the occupation of Shanghai. The High Court previously sentenced Remedios to eight years in prison, his assistant Xue Faer to two years and six months, and Xi Bake to four years. After the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial, the High Court changed the sentence yesterday morning to five years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for five years for Nakamura Remedios, one year and three months for Xue Faer, and one year and six months for Xi Bake. (3) Shen Liang, who was previously accused of working as a lawyer and clerk in the puppet police bureau during the enemy-puppet period, was acquitted by the High Court yesterday morning due to insufficient evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal sentenced "Jiangyin Tiger" Jieda Jiro to death, the execution has been delayed. The reason is that the Japanese liaison team appealed to the Ministry of National Defense, falsely claiming that the witness Zhang Yuren was actually Jiang Gongliang, the former warden of the Shanghai Prison Detention Center, who was wanted by the Jiangyin County government on suspicion of being a traitor. After receiving the appeal, the Ministry of National Defense ordered the military tribunal to investigate and reply. The tribunal sent a letter to the Jiangyin County government for detailed inquiries. A formal reply has been received from the county government, stating that all the allegations made by the Japanese are untrue. The military tribunal has submitted the results of the inquiry to the Ministry of National Defense yesterday.</p>

<p>(1) Together and Apart</p>
<p>Zhuo Yuezhen asks: My late husband was forced to death by thugs two years ago. My family's life is difficult and we rely on hired workers for survival. The sea of people is vast and I don't know what to do! At the beginning of this year, my sister introduced me to live with a Mr. Zhu. At that time, there was no marriage contract. At first, our feelings were still compatible, but after a few months, he changed his mind. Quarrels arose from time to time. After an argument, I ran away. I would like to ask: (1) Does the other party have the right to interfere after the separation? (2) Am I allowed to marry someone else? Is it illegal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Men and women living together can separate. Once separated, the two parties are no longer related. (2) A widow can remarry according to the law.</p>
<p>(2) Family Mutual Aid</p>
<p>Fu Weihao asks: I am an adopted son. When I was seven years old, I was adopted by Mr. Jia due to poverty. My foster mother is fierce and cruel. I have been abused since I was a child. Because I don't want to make my parents sad, I always endure it silently. I am now twenty-four years old and work in a factory, earning more than 100,000 yuan a month, and the lives of my family of several people depend on me. I have several legal questions, please answer them: (1) If my monthly income is limited and I cannot afford to support my parents, is it a crime? (2) My foster father has a fixed job and considerable income. Can I ask him for financial assistance? If my "foster mother" does not agree, is there any way? (3) If my foster father dies unfortunately, does the adopted son have inheritance rights to all the real estate? (4) As I am in charge of the household expenses, can I request equal distribution of the ancestral property?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) It is not a crime, because the law stipulates the extent of support should be determined according to the needs of the person entitled to support and the economic capacity and status of the person obligated to support. (2) Yes, because relatives have a mutual obligation to support each other. (3) If there are no other children and no will, then the "foster mother" and the "adopted son" should each receive one-half. (4) Before the death of the father, he has the right to freely use, benefit from, and dispose of ancestral property within the limits of the law, and the son cannot interfere.</p>

<p>The Fourth Phase, Third Distribution of Yarn of the Copied Products Industry Association of this city was allocated yesterday afternoon (16th) based on the approved quota of 4.778 pieces received. Representatives of each industry negotiated the distribution. The number of coarse yarn below 10 counts and 40 counts TK of this time distributed was slightly less than before, but based on the number of yarn returned in the previous resolution, there are still some that are not applicable. The 200 pieces of yarn missing in the third distribution have been replenished, but the 250 pieces missing in the second distribution of the fourth phase have not been replenished. It is also heard that the date for payment of the yarn allocation draft in Taijue is this Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week. Once the associations distribute it tomorrow, each factory receiving the distribution must pay the yarn factory as soon as possible. Due to the approaching end of the year, credit is very tight, and Friday is also a bank holiday, the association hopes that each factory will allocate funds early to avoid temporary urging.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Shanghai District Yarn Factories Joint Sales of Cotton Yarn Temporary Measures Approved in 8 Points The Principle of Exchanging Yarn for Cotton is Also Agreed <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a board meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and approved the 8 temporary measures for joint sales of cotton yarn by yarn factories in the Shanghai district. The measures agreed to the principle of exchanging yarn for cotton. The exchange ratio is roughly two bags of cotton yarn for one bag of cotton. The price of cotton yarn will imitate the method of the Central Bank's standard gold, taking on the nature, but the principle is to quote slightly lower than the market. It is heard that the 8 measures are still to be presented to the Board of Directors for implementation after approval.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Kerosene Suddenly Soars to 30,000 Yuan Per Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The kerosene used by the people in this city has recently suddenly soared. It is said that the kerosene panic is not caused by unscrupulous merchants monopolizing, but by the sudden rise in gold and banknotes. Therefore, the kerosene that was 20 yuan per catty at the time of victory jumped to 300, and then gradually rose to 400, 500, and 600. Yesterday's investigation showed that kerosene was no longer sold anywhere in this city. Even if there were a few allocations, the price reached 800 yuan per catty, nearly 30,000 yuan per case.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Coal Briquette Evaluation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Holds Meeting</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Industry Drafts Proposal</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a meeting of the Coal Briquette Price Review Committee, the Fuel Management Committee, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry, and the Coal Briquette Retailers at 2:00 PM tomorrow. Representatives will be sent to participate at that time. It is heard that the coal briquette industry has drafted a proposal. It is recommended that the evaluation of coal briquette prices should be calculated based on the black market price of Yangquan dross and Jiaozuo dross, plus simple manufacturing costs. The standard for coal allocation should divide the coal briquette industry into five grades: A, B, C Upper, C Middle, and C Lower. The distribution tonnage should also be divided into five grades: eight tons, five tons, three tons, two tons, and one ton.</p>
<p>In addition, 3,500 tons of Hongji white coal from Vietnamese loading ports are being transported to Shanghai by coal merchants in this city, and the Fuel Management Committee intends to facilitate it. It is said that the cost of the batch of white coal is about HK$344.75 per ton, and the freight is HK$40 to HK$60 per ton. There is also a batch of Huainan coal, and coal merchants are also preparing to load it to Shanghai for emergency response.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Coal Prices Rise Steadily <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Although the civilian factories in the coal market have a partial allocation of bituminous coal, the volume of goods that are being smuggled is limited. Once purchased, the spot goods are once again lacking, and market prices are rapidly rising. The amount of Hongji briquettes arriving and their market prices remain stable. The sale of Jiaozao briquettes is quite good, and market prices steadily climb, exceeding the $800,000 mark. Additionally, door sales at coal stores have led to the coal briquettes, firewood, and charcoal seeing great increases in sales, due to the increased price of kerosene. Currently, each stack of coal briquettes sells for $18,000-22,000, each load of pine firewood sells for $12,000, each tree of firewood sells for $700, each load of steel charcoal sells for $40,000, and each load of pine charcoal sells for $30,000.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Hong Kong Trade Decreases Sharply <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong 16th] Since our government implemented the import and export trade license application law, the goods transported from Hong Kong to the mainland have decreased sharply. Merchants have reduced their foreign orders due to stagnant inventory sales. Recently, Hong Kong's import trade has decreased by 60%, and exports have decreased by 50%. In addition, amid the sound of Japanese yarn being transported to Hong Kong for relief, Indian cloth is also being shipped to Hong Kong in large quantities for dumping, and the price of yarn and cloth in Hong Kong has plummeted.</p>
<p>Since the Wuchang Tea Company has shipped more than 1,000 boxes of the most popular colorless Ping Shui Xin Da Bang to the United States on the Donpaniceta ship that sailed to the United States last week, the foreign tea market continues to purchase the above colors. Other teas of inferior quality are extremely difficult to sell, and the temperature of Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei is gradually increasing, and the price has also been squeezed up. As for the high-end Chen Qimen, which British export companies have been paying close attention to, the market trend remains silent due to sellers’ single-minded focus on the fact that their goods are rare commodities. Domestic sales of black and green teas are still exhausted, and popularity is declining frequently.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Temporary Measures for Goods Transported from Hong Kong and Macau to Guangdong are Established <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Yuehai Customs Commissioner's Office has announced that all goods imported must be inspected for import licenses in accordance with the revised import and export trade regulations. To facilitate the processing and avoid the suspension of goods transported from Hong Kong and Macau to the province, temporary measures have been developed in consultation with representatives of the Provisional Import Management Committee in Guangzhou. The temporary measures are as follows: (1) From November 21 of this year to December 31 of the same year, for all goods that are allowed to be imported from Hong Kong and Macau, an import application must first be submitted to the designated bank in this city, and a temporary import license must be issued by each bank and sent to customs for inspection before being allowed to be imported. From January 1, 1947, all goods imported from Hong Kong and Macau must be handled in accordance with the various provisions of the revised import and export trade regulations. (2) If the importer is unable to complete the application registration procedures due to time constraints, they may issue a guarantee to the designated bank in this city, guaranteeing that after the goods enter the country, they will apply for a temporary import license from the designated bank in accordance with the regulations and send it to customs for supplementary inspection.</p>
<p>The Shanghai market for Tung Oil, a product of specific dimensions, is frozen. According to industry experts, the price of Tung Oil at the place of origin is almost the same as that of Shanghai. If interest and freight are added, it would be much higher than the current price in Shanghai. As a large amount of Tung Oil from the place of origin is continuously transported to Guangzhou for sale, Shanghai has become a non-exporting coast. Therefore, the market price of Tung Oil in Shanghai is more than 140,000 yuan per load, which is only the retail price in stores. The arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare, and trading is virtually suspended. Several businesses that undertake the export of Tung Oil have temporarily announced an end to operations to avoid excessive burdens. Currently, the price of Tung Oil in Zhejiang and Anhui is also the same as that in Shanghai, and freight and shoulder carrying, etc., are almost one-fifth to two-fifths of the value of the Tung Oil itself, so coming to Shanghai is a minority of a minority. It is also heard that the trend of hoarding Tung Oil in the mainland is quite intense, because the foreign price is not very good, while the degree of increase in the mainland is slightly better than that of the commonly known high-interest lending, which is also an abnormal phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw fluctuations due to financial instability and a tightening trend. The guild set the spot price for refined white sugar at 138,500 yuan per unit and raw red sugar at 121,200 yuan, an increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Guangdong merchants offered "Runde Qing Gao" at 100,300 to 102,000 yuan, and the secondary grade at 98,000 yuan, totaling over four hundred packages.

<p>Melton cloth is expected to be shipped less frequently in the future, and the existing American stock has been gradually depleted. Although the current stock in Shanghai is not lacking, those with financial strength are secretly trying to raise prices. Except for high-quality British-made overcoat fabrics, which are in short supply and rising in price, the rest are generally weak, both overtly and covertly, creating a situation of oversupply. Fancy woolen fabrics like Xuanwei are seeing downstream demand for both high-quality and low-quality goods. Serge is affected by the large influx of American goods being dumped on the market, and all brands are taking a hit. Gabardine in navy blue and grass green is not performing well. Yellow woolen cloth is affected by blankets, and the Ting River brand is declining daily. Except for some minor demand from Changsha and Sichuan, straight-grained woolen cloth is selling slowly, leading to sluggish prices. Camel hair and cavalry twill are selling slower than in previous years, and prices are generally flat. Domestic and imported women's woolen fabrics are in excessive supply, and due to seasonal factors, they are all continuing to fall in price. Only suit linings remain relatively stable.</p>

Not long after, Zhuo Shijin crossed from the right, and Luo Shoufu arrived in time and swept the ball in (2-0). After that, the ball went back and forth, and neither side gained anything. At the end of the first half, Qingbai took the lead.</p>
<p>Changing positions and fighting again, the Army United team gained the tailwind position and launched a counterattack. The Qingbai Club's goal was always in danger. Coach Li Yichen’s foot injury worsened, which was equivalent to playing with ten people. He had a whim and immediately changed the formation, with Lingsheng playing as the center forward, Shijin playing as the right forward, and himself guarding the right wing. At this time, the competition was fierce. However, Shijin got the ball and dribbled past two defenders, and went straight to the goal, and he succeeded in capturing a city. (3-0) Five minutes before the end of the game, the Army United team took advantage of a corner kick, and the Qingbai Club's goal fell into chaos. "Stickland" "stole a chicken" and launched a cold arrow. Qin Bi suddenly did not guard against it, and was scored a goal (3-1). Not long after, the whistle blew and the Qingbai Club played a triumph.</p>
<p>Basketball Meets a Strong Team and Wins South China by Three Points</p>
<p>The Qingbai football players have played two games in Hong Kong, one loss and one win. They are not discouraged by the loss, and they are steady and steady. They are not proud of the victory, and they fight to the end. In the eyes of Hong Kong fans, they have gained a very satisfactory impression. If they can defeat South China tomorrow, they will be even more popular, there is no doubt. However, the unsoundness of the front line is always the flaw of the Qingbai Club. Tomorrow's Chen Rong will inevitably have changes.</p>
<p>In basketball, Qingbai Club has won three games in three matches. On the 10th, they met the Hong Kong elite South China team. The two teams were evenly matched, and Qingbai Club won by only three points. Cai Wenhua, the hero of the Qingbai Club, only scored ten points due to the close surveillance of the opponent.

<p>Basketball is more lively and football is less exciting</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hong Kong, 13th] In the past few days, Qingbai Club has played two games in Hong Kong, one in basketball and one in football, and both have won. Although the Qingbai Club defeated the South China football team led by the king of football Li Huitang with a score of two to zero in the football match against South China on the 13th, the players on both sides were either injured or absent due to other reasons, and the game was not exciting at all. On the other hand, basketball is getting more and more lively, and it is a bit eclipsed.</p>
<p>As of the 11th, the Qingbai Club basketball team in Hong Kong has successively played against the Youth Association, the Black Cat, South China, and the Self-Reliance teams, and has won four games in a row. However, the Hong Kong basketball players are continuing to work hard and are catching up. In the battle with South China, the Qingbai Club won by only three points. In the battle with Self-Reliance, the victory or defeat was almost indistinguishable. In the end, they lost to the Qingbai Club by one point, and the fans kept yelling that it was not worth it. If the Qingbai Club are a little careless, then the final drama of one football and one basketball game (the 15th and 16th) may end in a "Waterloo" and leave Hong Kong with regret.</p>
<p>The tense basketball game defeated Self-Reliance by one point</p>
<p>First, let’s record the basketball game between Qingbai and Self-Reliance on the 11th: Self-Reliance is the champion team in Hong Kong. The atmosphere of the whole game was really tense, exciting and warm. At the beginning of the game, both sides calmed down. Self-Reliance used a man-to-man defense, which made Cai Wenhua unable to use his skills. Then, Zhang Shutang of Self-Reliance fouled, and Zhang Shaoqing did not score the goal. Soon, Zhenxuan showed his power and scored the first point with a side shot. Shaoqing was not effective, and although he had a chance to break into the basket alone, he finally missed the shot at the bottom of the basket. In the sound of fighting again, after Zhang Shutang failed to score a goal at the bottom of the basket, he finally made a comeback and scored a goal. At this point, Qingbai called a timeout and sent Chen Qingjiang and Zhang Yuyi to replace Zhang Shaoqing and Cai Jindian. Then, He Lide scored a goal at the bottom of the basket, and Cai Wenhua scored a long shot, chasing the score to a 4-4 tie. But before the end of the first quarter, Zhenxuan made another long shot, creating a situation in which Self-Reliance led by 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Lu Dezhang of Self-Reliance arrived and replaced Pan Yaojun. After Fang Ruoshan missed a chance at the bottom of the basket, Wenhua made a 6-6 tie. But after that, Self-Reliance’s momentum was fierce. With a series of shots and free throws, they created a good situation of 16 points. It was not until before the halftime whistle that Cai Wenhua made a long shot and scored two more points for Qingbai. In the first half, Self-Reliance took the lead with 16-8.</p>
<p>Self-Reliance should not have, and should never have, used Chen Yaoning and Lei Zhaoyuan, two new players, at the beginning of the second half. Qingbai took the opportunity to catch up. After Dezhang scored a point, Chen Qingjiang made a series of shots and free throws, scoring three points. Cai Wenhua made three consecutive shots. Although Lu Dezhang tried hard to score another point, Qingbai’s round of rapid attacks had already chased the score to 15-12. Self-Reliance then hurriedly called a timeout and replaced Fang Ruoshan and Gao Jiahe. But at that time, Qingbai’s momentum was like a rainbow and could not be replicated. They were chased back to a 20-20 tie. When the whistle blew, Zhen Zheng fouled and was penalized one ball, which was left to be executed in the fourth quarter, ending the third quarter.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, after Chen Qingjiang scored a goal, Qingbai took the lead by one point for the first time. Although Fang Ruoshan also scored back one point with a free throw shortly after, Wenhua scored another point soon after. After that, Self-Reliance seemed to have a chance to win again. After Shijie scored a shot and Ruoshan scored a free throw, they once led by 27-23. However, after Pan Yaojun missed a free throw, Ma Canxi and Zhang Shaoqing each scored a goal, making the score 27-24. At this time, Zhenxuan left the field due to cramps. Although Lu Dezhang scored two points with a long shot, time was not on their side. Self-Reliance finally lost by one point with a score of 26-27. The scores of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai Team Shot Penalty Foul Score</p>
<p>Zhang Shaoqing 1 0 2 2</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua 5 0 0 10</p>
<p>Cai Jinhuang 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>He Lide 1 1 1 3</p>
<p>Zhang Yuyi 3 0 1 6</p>
<p>Ma Canxi 1 0 2 2</p>
<p>Chen Qingjiang 1 2 1 4</p>
<p>Total 12 3 7 27</p>
<p>Self-Reliance Team Shot Penalty Foul Score</p>
<p>Lu Zhenxuan 2 0 2 4</p>
<p>Fang Ruoshan 1 2 1 4</p>
<p>Zhang Shutang 2 2 0 6</p>
<p>Li Shijie 1 0 0 2</p>
<p>Gao Jiahe 1 1 2 3</p>
<p>Pan Xiaojun 0 0 1 0</p>
<p>Lu Dezhang 3 1 1 7</p>
<p>Chen Yaoning 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Ren Zongchao 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Lei Zhaoyuan 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Total 10 6 7 26</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, Self-Reliance could have won but did not, and Qingbai was cautious. Hong Kong basketball talents are really not weak, and it would be a big mistake for Qingbai to be "arrogant."</p>
<p>Li Huitang played but South China still suffered a setback</p>
<p>In the football game (13th), Qingbai defeated South China by a score of 2-0. Zhu Yongqiang and Zou Wenzhi of South China were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong from Guangzhou yesterday to participate in the game, but unfortunately the train broke down on the way, causing them to "miss the game." Tan Zhenqian and Li Huitang were temporarily pulled up to play, so the lineup was slightly changed from before. Qingbai’s request to borrow Zhang Jinhai was approved by the Football Association, and the front line was adjusted again, which was stronger than when Li Yichen was the center forward. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(South China Club)</p>
<p>Hua Ji, Lin Rushun, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Liang Rongzhao, Xie Jinhong, Li Shuoyou, Tan Zhenqian, Li Huitang, Chen Dehui, Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>(Qingbai Club)</p>
<p>Qin Bigao, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Cao Qiuting, Luo Shoufu, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Xu Wenkui</p>
<p>The South Qing match had no exciting performance. Although South China lost, the time to take the initiative accounted for 75% of the entire game. Qingbai only had a few deep opportunities, and several shots either hit the post or went offside. The first goal it won was in the 20th minute of the first half. Qiuting’s sideline cross was not intended to be a shot. With the help of the wind, it broke the record. Hua Ji lacked judgment and failed to save it in time, causing it to be missed. Qingbai’s victory in this game was after South China’s fierce attack failed. South China’s combat mood was quite affected.</p>
<p>Only two minutes after the start of the second half, Qingbai launched another raid. The South China defense failed to return in time. Qiuting and Wenkui’s left and right long passes and Jinhai’s breakthrough in the middle finally resulted in Jinhai shooting the second goal within a dozen yards in front of the goal.

<h3 id="e186">No Champion Has Been Produced in the Third Group of the Jingwu Table Tennis Tournament; The Competition Will Continue at 7:00 Tonight <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The fifth Jingwu Cup table tennis tournament’s third group started at 7:00 last night at the Jingwu Association Hall on the third floor of Cishu. Because there are seven people in this group, a single cycle should have a total of twenty-two games, so the finals have not yet been decided. It is expected that the voices of Zhang Shanda, Shui Hangao, and Wang Xingyuan are the highest for the championship and runner-up. It is said that Wu Zuochang, a Guangdong warrior in this group, was originally very hopeful, but unfortunately his skills were barren, so he was poisoned by Wang Xingyuan in the first battle. When he met Zhang Shanda again, although he tried his best, he lost again because his morale had been frustrated. However, although Wang Xingyuan won against Wu Zuochang in one battle, he lost to Lin Wanhua in the next battle. However, his offensive and defensive strategies seem to be inferior to those of Zhang and Shui. The result will be seen tonight. In this group, Zhang Shanda and Shui Hangao’s skills are comparable to each other. The battle situation yesterday was as follows: Zhang Shanda won four, Shui Hangao won three, Wang Xingyuan won two, Wu Zuochang won two and lost two, Liu Jiarong won one and lost three, Lin Wanhua lost four, and Li He lost three. The competition will continue at the same place at 7:00 tonight, and there will be a fierce battle.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Ministry of Education Will Officially Establish the "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" Next Year; University Courses May Be Broadcast Under the Name "Open University" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] In order to actively promote educational broadcasting, the Ministry of Education has prepared 1,000 radios for various provinces and cities. Regarding the Ministry's broadcasting efforts, although programs are currently scheduled and broadcast in phases through the Central Broadcasting Station each week, it is not as convenient as having its own educational radio station for broadcasting at any time. Therefore, it has been decided to establish its own educational radio station. In terms of name, since the Central Broadcasting Station already exists, to avoid duplication and confusion, it may be named "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" in the future. The decision to establish this radio station has been made, and broadcasting equipment has already been ordered from the United States. Because it needs to be tailored to China's broadcasting needs, it requires one longwave and two shortwave transmitters. Currently, there are no ready-made products in the United States, and it needs to be newly manufactured. The Ministry of Education has been consulted for its opinions, and the Ministry is currently designing blueprints to be sent to the United States for manufacturing. It is expected that it will be shipped to China next year, and our Ministry of Education will then be able to officially establish the "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" to broadcast educational news for the long term. This will not only promote social education but also gradually make it possible to broadcast secondary school courses and various university courses. For example, at a designated time, a certain type of textbook will be broadcast, and anyone with a radio can listen to the broadcast lectures. University students can listen to lectures by teachers through the radio, and those who are employed and wish to take university courses can also listen to the radio station as a form of part-time study. It is understood that this radio station may be named "Open University."</p>

<p>The Ministry of the Interior believes that the handling of joint guarantee and joint liability for opium suppression should be based on the spirit of rewarding and punishing, with the goal of achieving the requirements of opium prohibition as the main focus. The situation in Shanghai is special, and it is difficult to handle the matter through the Baojia system. Permission has been granted to first change the responsibility to the heads of households. However, Baojia personnel should still find ways to overcome difficulties in drug suppression work, and complete it in accordance with the law, taking responsibility at each level, and strictly enforce joint punishment to demonstrate thoroughness and promote opium prohibition. This has been telegraphed to the municipal government for dissemination.</p>

Regarding the Shandong, Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu refugees staying in the district, estimated to be over 30,000 people, all of whom are without clothing or food, it has been decided to petition the Relief Committee to establish a Zhabei branch, and to request the allocation of more old clothing and flour for relief. It is also planned to establish a winter shelter at the Zhongfu Silk Factory in the district to investigate the poor people in each Bao who urgently need relief.

<h3 id="e192">Shaoxing: A City of Culture and Antiquities <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>—10th Dispatch, Our Correspondent Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>Let's rescue the ancient ship "Shaoxing," not only preventing it from sinking but also enabling it to carry the people of Shaoxing to the realm of happiness!</p>
<p>Shaoxing is a city of culture and antiquities. In recent years, well-known figures such as Qiu Jin, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, and Lu Xun were all born in Shaoxing. The Mausoleum of Yu the Great, where "the virtues of rulers are pondered between the rivers Huai and Han, and the heart of Dao is seen in the subtlety of thought," is also located in Shaoxing. The Grand Historian Sima Qian "explored the tomb of Yu and climbed Mount Kuaiji," and Qing emperors also used the nine-bow ritual to pay their respects at the mausoleum. This shows that it is truly an extraordinary sacred place. Although Gu Jiegang once said from the perspective of new historiography that "Yu was a worm," in the eyes of most people, Yu was indeed a virtuous ruler who served the people wholeheartedly and was loved by them, especially the descendants of Yu with the surname Si residing near the Mausoleum of Yu.</p>
<p>Superficial Prosperity, Inner Emptiness</p>
<p>In terms of products, Shaoxing's "laojiao" (aged rice wine), freshwater fish, Ping Shui tea, and fragrant cakes are all well-known. Even in the "underworld" (if there is such a world), Shaoxing enjoys a good reputation because it produces large quantities of tin foil, which is sold throughout the country. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shaoxing is a city of culture and antiquities. However, Shaoxing City is now much smaller than before, and it is declining day by day. Mr. Shao Hongshu, the principal of Shaoxing Kuaiji Middle School, told the reporter, "Shaoxing is like a big ship that is gradually sinking! Ping Shui tea leaves are rotting in piles because they cannot be exported. Huangjiu (yellow rice wine) and tin foil cannot raise their heads due to high interest rates and heavy taxes. Even the 'shiye' (private secretaries) are degenerating. The number of middle school students, the material for creating shiye, is also gradually decreasing, and the level of national education is inevitably declining..." Mr. Shao shook his head and sighed as he said this.</p>
<p>This time, our reporter in Hangzhou, led by Mr. Chu Yusheng, the general manager of the "Zhejiang Provincial Capital Foreign Correspondent Association," visited Shaoxing. At first glance, the city still looks very prosperous. The streets and alleys, although slightly narrow, are cleaner and flatter than those in Hangzhou. After nightfall, the lights are brilliant, and the shops on both sides of the street compete for customers. Banners with "big sale" are flying in the wind, and some have even built special colorful arches. There are also many customers coming to the stores. However, after asking several shops, their total business volume is not large, only making two or three hundred thousand [currency units] per day. The profit of small merchants is often not enough to offset the high interest rates of two or three cents. Recently, seven or eight old shops with more than ten years of history have also been forced to close down. According to the Chamber of Commerce, many more stores will be forced to close during the New Year and Spring Festival. The tide of closure has reached Shaoxing, and many old owners are frowning and worrying about the end of the year! A Shaoxing colleague said to the reporter with emotion, "Don't look at the prosperity on the streets. Their insides are very empty. The prosperity is only superficial, only a 'last flicker of glory' for Shaoxing's market!"</p>
<p>The Lifeline of the Economy: The Foil Industry in Crisis</p>
<p>The general business situation is like this, and so is the brewing industry and the tin foil manufacturing industry, which are Shaoxing's special products. The tin foil industry, in particular, seems to have reached its dangerous end. Tin foil is essentially a product of superstition, but the deep penetration of Buddhism into Chinese folk customs has enabled the tin foil industry in Shaoxing to flourish. They transport tin materials from Yunnan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, beat them into thin sheets, and grind and plate them on the deer-calling paper produced in Xiaoshan and Fenghua counties to make coins and ingots for burning incense and offering sacrifices. It originated in the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty and has a history of more than 500 years. Before the war, it produced 3 million pieces per year, most of which were exported. Therefore, it is a lifeline of the local economy. Later, because the government strictly restricted the development of superstitious industries, the output gradually decreased sharply. After the Anti-Japanese War, transportation was blocked and exports became a big problem. Since the victory, internal strife has not ceased, and the sales channels in the north have still not been opened. The annual output is now only a few hundred thousand pieces, less than one-three-hundredth of what it used to be! Moreover, according to people familiar with Shaoxing's commercial situation, "Now the export cost of cigarettes in Shaoxing is offset by the import cost of tin foil." Therefore, the tin foil industry can no longer be the lifeline of Shaoxing's local economy. However, 240,000 people in Shaoxing directly or indirectly rely on it for a living. Although the tin foil industry is only a household handicraft industry, with only a dozen larger foil shops in the county, most of them are dedicated technical workers, except for some women who regard it as a side business. Recently, an even greater crisis has come before them. That is, the military's smuggling is becoming more and more rampant. The original tax on tin foil was 25%, which accounted for 60% of the total business tax revenue in Zhejiang Province, which shows the abundance of tax revenue. Now it has been changed to a goods tax, which is under the central government, and has been increased to 80% since October 1. Later, because merchants and people could not bear the heavy burden, the tax rate was reduced to 60%. Ordinary wandering soldiers gathered in teams of six or seven people, forcibly used vehicles, and smuggled with weapons, evading heavy taxes and making huge profits. They became even more active in November, and the Goods Tax Bureau had to ask the Security Command to send a platoon (30 people) to suppress smuggling. However, they still used violent means to break through the tax gates. Their reason is, "It's already good enough that we're not bandits." They also threatened, "If you open fire to stop us, then not only will you bleed, but Shaoxing City will be finished!" Therefore, Director Yuan of the department in charge said painfully, "In order to maintain law and order and avoid being used by others, we have to endure it. As a result, the total revenue for more than two months has been only over 1 billion [currency units]. According to the budget, there should be 12 billion in tax revenue per year!" The reporter went to see the tax gate area and found that, indeed, in the evening and at dusk, lawless soldiers were pushing trucks through. Large trucks of tin foil were lightly smuggled out of the city in this way, and sold cheaply in Zhuji and Hangzhou foil shops, making the foil price show no signs of improvement, affecting legitimate merchants and factory owners, and putting foil shops in a new crisis of total collapse! Shaoxing has a population of 820,000, so one-third of the people may be completely unemployed in this new crisis, without food to eat. The manufacture of tin foil was originally a superstitious industry, and its collapse is not a pity; but the unemployment of one-third of the population will cause much social unrest and chaos, which is the most serious problem. And the key to this problem, like the key to the abolition of rickshaws in Hangzhou, is mainly the problem of changing careers. The rickshaw pullers in Hangzhou are mostly silk factory workers. To abolish rickshaws, you must first restore the silk factories and let them return to their "hometown." The tin foil industry belongs to superstition, which is prohibited by law, but the way out for workers to change careers is a big problem. Rural areas? The brewing industry? Neither can accommodate them, and it is not feasible. Recently, seven relevant foil industry unions in Shaoxing held a joint meeting and, as a result, "Since science has developed to the atomic age, we are willing to jump out of the superstitious factories." Therefore, they launched a career change movement, requesting the central government to allocate three-tenths of the total foil tax revenue to be used as career change funds for foil workers. This will certainly reduce the central government's fiscal revenue, but in order to accelerate the abolition of superstition and relieve the suffering of the people, this may not be a bad idea!</p>
<p>Tea Rotting, Tea Farmers Crying, Tea Merchants Sighing Secretly</p>
<p>Shaoxing is also the tea production center of the Ping Shui area. The green pearl tea here used to sell well abroad. Before the war, Zhejiang's export tea reached 200,000 [units], accounting for one-third of the country's tea exports, and Ping Shui tea sold the best. The tea garden area in the area is more than 200,000 mu, and the total output reaches more than 200,000 [units]. However, after years of war destruction, traffic was cut off, rural areas were destroyed, and output was sharply reduced. After the national restoration, tea farmers and tea merchants re-established their old businesses. However, after the war, people's livelihoods declined, funds dried up, and even if they pooled their resources, they could not restore Ping Shui tea. The Agricultural Bank of China provided 2.2 billion in tea loans, but because the funds arrived late and costs rose sharply, and the United States restricted the price of Chinese tea, foreign sales were bleak, and they could only watch Japan, India, and Ceylon dump low-cost tea on the international market while letting green pearl tea rot in the Ping Shui area! This year, the factories purchased 27,600 dan of raw tea, only one-fifth of what it was before the war; if the tea production this year is calculated at one-third, there are also 41,400 dan left in the hands of tea farmers, unable to be exchanged for rice! Shaoxing currently has 24 tea factories, and this year, it purchased no more than 15,100 dan of raw tea. Due to a shortage of capital, a large amount of tea cannot be made into finished products, causing tea farmers to cry, tea leaves to rot, and tea merchants to sigh secretly! High interest rates not only block the tea industry but also erode the silk industry. Shaoxing silk production, like Hangzhou silk and Wuxing silk, is one of the three silk production centers in Zhejiang Province. Now, it is declining like Hangzhou, and even the high-speed weaving machines have not been restored. No wonder the people of Shaoxing no longer say "Oh, Shaoxing's essays are the best in the world," but instead exclaim: "High interest rates kill people the most!"</p>
<p>Many Deposits in the County Treasury, Difficult to Collect Sufficient Land Tax</p>
<p>In terms of politics, since Lin Ze became the head of Shaoxing, it is said that because the local area can cooperate with the government, political affairs have been promoted quite well. Although financial expenditures are large, the county treasury still has 40 million yuan in addition to land tax. However, the collection of land tax in kind will still be implemented for the first time this year. Collection began on November 1. Because landlords are slow to collect rent, transportation is inconvenient, and, more importantly, the number of land and grain households is as high as 530,000, three times larger than the actual number of households. Many grain accounts have no landlords to collect, and less than 20% has been collected so far (the total tax amount for the county is 860,000 yuan, or 230,000 dan). It would be very satisfactory if 50% could be collected before the end of the year. It is impossible to meet the central government's deadline.</p>
<p>Reading Shaoxing Newspapers Is Like Drinking Plain Water</p>
<p>Shaoxing is known for its shiye (private secretaries), so Shaoxing's culture should be very developed, but due to the limitations of various social relationships, Shaoxing's cultural circles are much worse than those in Hangzhou, the provincial capital. Shaoxing now has three daily newspapers, the "Shaoxing Republic Daily" of the county party department and the "Shaoxing News" and "Yue Bao," which are run by merchants, all of which are open to one page. Because Hangzhou newspapers can arrive at 9:00 a.m. on the same day, and Shanghai newspapers can arrive at 3:00 p.m., the sales volume of local newspapers is limited to about 2,000 copies. But the most important thing is that each newspaper does not have a certain characteristic. The president of Yue Bao put it well: "Because Shaoxing's newspapers (1) have no definite goal and cannot exert a spiritual stimulating effect, (2) dare not criticize reality, and (3) focus on urban areas and neglect rural areas, they cannot go deep into the people and breathe with the people." So, reading one is like reading the second, and even this one is "drinking plain water!" The only regular publications are the "Youth Guidance News" of the Youth Army, the "Children's Friend" of the Youth League, the "Shaoxing Education" of the County Education Section, and the "Children's Weekly," none of which are general readings; in addition, there are three regular newspapers such as "Shao Bao," which are tabloids, but some of them sell better than the big newspapers! Low-level tastes are popular, which is not unique to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Leaflets and Lawsuits Were Thrown at Reporters</p>
<p>Writing this, I remember an interesting drama. When the reporter group was resting in the County Chamber of Commerce, a soldier suddenly walked in and handed us "leaflets," accusing the Youth League, through "Xu Jun," of forcibly closing the "Juemin Theater" he was running and turning it into the "Youth Theater," appealing to us. It was as if small people were stopping officials' sedan chairs to file lawsuits, simply regarding us news reporters as judges, making us feel flattered. In the afternoon, when the tea party hosted by County Chief Lin was held in the same place, a worker handed in another "lawsuit," in which a woman named "Miao Mushan" "respectfully appealed to all reporters" to accuse "Xu Jun, the councilor of the Third Regiment" of forcibly occupying civilian houses. Two "cases," with "Xu Jun" caught in the middle, the latter was obviously a counterattack. We are not judicial officials after all and cannot make a judgment, so we had to ask County Chief Lin to explain. It is said that the "Juemin Theater" was run by the officers' regiment, and because it did not pay rent, the landlord subleased it to the Youth League as the site of the Youth Theater. There was a rental agreement, and the Youth League had already paid the "Juemin Theater" 2 million [currency units] twice for the sublease fee. This time, "Xu Jun" was asking for it for the third time. If another 2 million [currency units] were given, there would still be dozens of "Xu Jun" to trouble them and ask for the house. The implication was that "Xu Jun" was extorting money. But even the county chief could not handle this kind of dispute involving the military, so how could we reporters handle it? However, they all insisted on appealing to the reporters, which shows the importance that ordinary people attach to news reporters. What should especially alert us, especially Shaoxing's colleagues, is that "Shaoxing is like a big ship that is gradually sinking!" As reporters, the mouthpiece of the people of Shaoxing, we should call on the people of Shaoxing, guide the people of Shaoxing, and do everything in our power to assist the government in rescuing the ancient ship "Shaoxing," not only preventing it from sinking but also enabling it to carry the people of Shaoxing to the realm of happiness!</p>

<p>—Paris Airmail, 3rd, Our Special Correspondent in Paris Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>The talent of the Chinese people has never been inferior to that of warriors. Nowadays, the domestic compatriots are facing economic hardship and a high cost of living. Although the enjoyment of material things may not be entirely satisfactory, from a spiritual point of view, it is fortunate that various parties and factions in our country are assisting the government in resisting the war with one heart and one mind, and have achieved success. This is truly a blessing from heaven. Recently, Chinese art celebrities at home and abroad have also been able to seize the opportunity, taking advantage of the UNESCO Scientific and Cultural Conference convened in Paris in November 1946, to gain great glory in the international arena. For example, the New Art Exhibition, The International Exhibition of Modern Art, organized by the Science and Cultural Bureau, was held in the Tokyo Building of the New Art Museum on President Wilson Avenue in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Thirty countries participated, and commentators generally said that the works of France, Britain, the United States, and China were the most moving. Chinese painters also gained a superior position among the four powerful countries. Although the Chinese people are temporarily in difficulty, this spiritual tonic is like drinking tonic wine, and the future of the country is truly promising.</p>
<p>It is found that the items displayed by the Chinese Department were all flown in from China in time and were even better than the items previously exhibited in London. According to the reporter of the Continental Edition of the Daily Mail, among the Chinese works, Zhang Daqian's large-scale lotus pond, with its vast momentum, is the most commendable (i.e., the four pictures in the upper center of the attached picture). The two pictures on the left are Xu Beihong's horses and cattle written in Panxi, and the one on the right is Deng Baichun's flower and bird masterpieces from Guangdong. On the left and right are Yu Youren's (Zi Sheng), president of the Sino-French Association, cursive calligraphy of five couplets of stone carvings (the French translation is Calligraphie-parallele Poetique, the upper sentence "The past is extremely memorable," and the lower sentence "The distant mountains are friendly again"), which deeply add color to the whole venue. Other works, such as Qing Tianyou's white sketch portraits, Pan Yuliang's nude oil paintings, Shen Yinmo's inscription on Wu Zuoren's Tibetan tea picture, and Liao Xinxue's distant mountains, were all praised by Western newspapers. At the same time, Liao Xinxue's personal painting exhibition was also publicly displayed at the Galerie des Deuxlles, No. 1 Quai de la Mégisserie, Flower Market. Thirty or so fine works of landscapes, birds, and flowers were sold out. His No. 1 Flock of Wild Geese (as shown in the attached picture) was awarded an honorary prize for participating in the Paris Spring Art Exhibition and was not allowed to be sold. Liao's landscapes, with their misty clouds, were much loved by a Swiss person who bought many of them. Living in the mountains, they complemented each other perfectly. Other fine works in the Tokyo Building, such as Chen Shuren's kapok trees painted in Xishan, Chongqing, vividly express the scenery of southern China. Qi Baishi's cattle and flowers are bold and unrestrained, showing that he is getting stronger as he gets older. Wang Yachen, the principal of Xinhua School, painted goldfish vividly, with the inscription: "The wind turns and the clouds break, the rain is clear at first, the reflection on the pond is warm and bright again, the red fish are lively, and the new green water is spread flat." His writing is appropriate, and among the landscape paintings, it can be said to be a divine work, with none better than Huang Binhong's Maple Forest Walking with a Staff, with three poems inscribed. I love the second poem the most: "The empty pavilion is desolate with the flowing river, passing Hengtang to the west, the water is overflowing, the poetic thoughts cannot help but be good for the setting sun, the shadow of the green mountain falls on the small boat." Reciting this poem repeatedly, all the pain and sorrow in the world can be thrown to the winds. This is the wonderful use of Chinese characters, which cannot be compared with any Western language. Each work has a French translation, which is very convenient for visitors to view. It is a pity that the translated poems in the Chinese works do not retain the poetic charm of the Chinese text, so that the tourists who appreciate Chinese paintings, like the foreigners who visit Chinese scenic spots, cannot understand the joy of the spiritual enjoyment of the couplets and poems in front of them. At least the joy that the Chinese can experience is reduced by half. This is a great regret in the art world.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the Ministry of Education and Culture is planning to translate foreign literary works, as well as books published by private bookstores that are not easy to profit from, into English, French, and other languages and publish them quickly. Those intellectuals who bury themselves in translating poetry and other works, because these profound works are not for profit, may abandon their available positions and even sacrifice the money they could earn. The conference will also pay close attention to supporting their lives and the happiness of their families. If this is realized, it will truly benefit the future of mankind and not only revive the arts.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Shaoxing Wine and Freshwater Fish <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 10th</p>
<p>Speaking of "Shaoxing Wine," its fame is truly resounding. I remember when I was in the Southwest rear area during the war, many foreign friends, while heartily drinking Moutai, once said to me, "When we get to your Zhejiang, we'll drink Shaoxing wine," a look of yearning overflowing their expressions. Indeed, Shaoxing wine doesn't have the bitterness of brandy or whiskey, nor the intensity of Moutai, and it’s not like beer, which you can drink for a long time without much reaction. Its aroma is very gentle, it tastes somewhat sweet, and its color is lighter than wine. A few small cups leave you pleasantly tipsy. I gave a brief introduction in my article "Walking Around Xiao and Shao" on August 25th, but the history of "Shaoxing Wine" really deserves a more detailed account.</p>
<p>The Tale of Bottle Mountain</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn period, King Goujian of Yue, while recuperating and training his troops, had a fine wine made in Yue to present to the state of Wu. Wu Zixu's army once drank this fine wine heartily in the Jiaxing and Jiashan areas. After drinking, the empty jars were piled up into a mountain, and the name "Bottle Mountain" still remains in He and Shan, passed down as a beautiful tale for thousands of years. Therefore, the history of Shaoxing wine should be almost two thousand years. Later, Shaoxing wine gradually became appreciated, and was sold in Jiang, Zhe, Min, Gan, and Wan provinces, and even to the capital of Beiping, as tribute to the emperor. The reputation of Shaoxing old wine grew greater. In every township and town in Shaoxing, almost every farming household brewed their own wine in small quantities. The largest wine-making areas were the Keqiao, Dongpu Village Head, and Zhangguali areas. There were large breweries there, and empty jars were piled up higher than houses, with large vats of wine lined up. According to Chen Disun, the chairman of the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, "In the heyday, Shaoxing County's wine makers competed to produce, with probably more than 300,000 vats. Eight years ago, each large household would brew six to seven thousand vats." Each vat could fill ten jars of wine. Eighteen dou of glutinous rice could brew one vat of wine, and each jar of wine was generally about fifty jin. Breweries also produced some distilled spirits. After the wine was made, the leftover wine lees could be sold in the market, which was enough to offset the cost of labor and firewood.</p>
<p>Main Reason for Fame</p>
<p>The main ingredient for brewing wine is glutinous rice. This glutinous rice is not produced locally, but comes from Danyang, Jintan, Liyang in Jiangsu, and Jiaxing in this province. The pure and rich water quality of Jian Lake in Shaoxing is the main reason for Shaoxing wine's fame.</p>
<p>Among Shaoxing wines, the most famous at one time were the so-called Zhuangyuanhong, Jiafan, Zhuyeqing, Shanliang, and Huadiao. If the original jar is buried underground for more than ten years, the color and aroma of the wine will be even better. Many families in Jiangnan buried Shaoxing wine underground before the war, and after several years, they would take it out to entertain guests at weddings or banquets. In Shaoxing, many wealthy families would make one or two vats of wine after the birth of a daughter, seal them tightly, and bury them under the soil of the road that family members frequently walked. When the daughter got married, they would take it out to entertain guests. Some people called this wine "Daughter Wine."</p>
<p>Broken Jars and Empty Vats</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, exports of Shaoxing wine stagnated. The Japanese and puppet organizations stole the method of brewing Shaoxing wine, set up factories in Harbin, and dumped large quantities in North China, Northeast China, and Southeast Asia. In the Northwest and Southwest rear areas, some wine workers who had fled from Shaoxing also raised the banner of Shaoxing old wine and brewed Shaoxing wine locally to satisfy the longing and admiration of guests. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the traces left by the Japanese and puppets in Shaoxing regarding Shaoxing wine were broken jars and empty vats, piled up in a mess. Although many people have worked hard to revive it, it is not even one-tenth or one-twelfth of what it was before the war. According to a survey by the Shaoxing branch of the Commodity Tax Bureau, only 19,900 vats were brewed last year. After the autumn harvest last year, glutinous rice only sold for 5,000 yuan per shi, so the cost of rice for one vat of wine was only 9,000 yuan. The tax is calculated at 80% of the cost. However, this year, the price of each jar of wine is more than 30,000 yuan. In this way, the brewers can make a good profit, so there are especially many brewers this year, even willing to borrow at high interest rates to brew wine. However, this year the price of glutinous rice will be more than 60,000 or 70,000 yuan per shi, plus labor, firewood, and taxes, the price of wine must be raised very high. It is a question whether many people who love wine and are greedy for it will have the purchasing power.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Wine Society</p>
<p>Now many people in Shaoxing plan to transport Shaoxing wine across the ocean to the Western Hemisphere to compete with foreign wines. However, Shaoxing is not suitable for packaging. After packaging, it will precipitate. Only by covering the original jar with earthen jars and mud can the jars be sealed, but this seems too unmodern and uneconomical. If glass bottles or other packaging materials are used to pump out the air and store Shaoxing wine, then after burying or storing it for thousands of years, its quality will not improve. This cannot compete with brandy and other wines, which get better with age.</p>
<p>For the present, I think that all parts of the country should uniformly use domestic Shaoxing wine, and no longer need foreign wines. What cocktail parties are not as good as Shaoxing wine societies, so that Shaoxing wine can be active in the Chinese market, and the brewers of Shaoxing wine can have flexible funds; then the government or those with funds should use scientific methods to set up factories and study carefully, and then sell it abroad.</p>
<p>Fan Li Raises Fish</p>
<p>In addition to the famous old wine, Shaoxing is also famous throughout the country for its freshwater fish. During the Spring and Autumn Period, after the state of Yue defeated the state of Wu, Doctor Fan Li resigned and retired, and lived by raising fish in the rivers inside and outside Shaoxing. The fish gradually sold well, and Fan Li became very wealthy, gathering and dispersing his wealth three times. Everyone called him Tao Zhugong. The area of fish ponds in the county is more than 100,000 mu. When paddling a boat or motorboat through the inner river, there is a bamboo fence every less than a li. In the past heyday, the annual output could reach five to six million jin. Last year's output was only 500,000 jin. This year is better, with an output of one million jin.</p>
<p>Fisheries Organization</p>
<p>Shaoxing has a Fisheries Marketing Cooperative. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, "Because fishing grounds and fishing gear were mostly damaged during the war, and fishermen were also affected by high-interest loans, the fish, when it reaches the hands of customers, has to add more than ten times the exploitation. The marketing cooperative, in order to reduce this heavy exploitation, obtains the fish from the fishermen, so that it can be delivered to the customers more directly." On the contrary, some people are opposed to the Fisheries Marketing Cooperative. They say that this organization is a joint organization of "big bosses." The so-called "big bosses" are the leaders of many fishermen, who handle marketing affairs on their behalf. This person does not fish, nor does he need to work, but enjoys the benefits. In reality, they are not fishermen. Now the cooperative wants to tax the fish that passes through their organization, extracting ten jin of tax for every hundred jin. Some say they extract eight jin of tax, and others say they extract four or five jin of tax. In short, they want to extract tax. They believe that this kind of taxation is exploitation, so they are brewing opposition.</p>
<p>Cultivating Fish Fry</p>
<p>Although Shaoxing produces freshwater fish, its fish fry is transported from Jiujiang in Jiangxi to Linghe, and then from Linghe to Shaoxing. Now the people of Shaoxing are also paying attention to cultivating fish fry, but no one has thought about how to cultivate fish fry or which pond to choose for cultivation. I believe that today, cultivating fish fry is an urgent matter for Shaoxing's freshwater fish. If the cooperative only collects fish tax and does not serve the fishermen, this is not right. Therefore, the government should best send fisheries experts to Shaoxing to study suitable locations for cultivating fish fry, and at the same time enable fishermen to truly profit and customers to truly receive benefits.</p>
<p>Promising Future</p>
<p>At present, a sense of decadence and pessimism prevails in Shaoxing. Among their four major specialties, tin foil is a superstitious item and will be abolished sooner or later. There is no hope for exports of Pingshui tea, so there is naturally no way. Shaoxing wine and freshwater fish are also showing signs of decline. I say that except for tin foil, there are ways for all of them. Tea, Shaoxing wine, and freshwater fish, as long as they are studied and improved, they all have a very good future. In particular, Shaoxing wine and freshwater fish, both have more than 2,000 years of history, and are relics of King Goujian of Yue's recuperation and training. We should protect and develop them well. (On the way from Shao to Hang, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Further Discussion on Zhejiang Water Conservancy Projects <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Qi</p>
<p>(1) The stone embankment on the Jiang shore south of Fuyang City was washed away by flooding this spring for 50 meters, and the rest is also in imminent danger, urgently needing repair. After surveying by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the cost is estimated at 150 million yuan. A request has been submitted to the central government to allocate 50 million yuan, and the remaining funds will be raised locally. Funds are currently being raised to start repairs.</p>
<p>(2) The flood control projects for Fengqiao River and Baita Lake in Zhuji. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to survey and design for the Fengqiao River, and the estimated cost is 81.1338 million yuan. It has been agreed to allocate 175,246 jin of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief, so construction can begin immediately. The Baita Lake improvement project is currently being surveyed and designed by the Water Conservancy Bureau.</p>
<p>The above four projects have all been submitted to the central government for allocation of funds. Except for the Fuyang City South Jiang shore project, which has already been allocated 50 million yuan, the rest have not yet been approved.</p>
<p>(3) The Jinhua River flood control project involves seven counties: Jinhua, Lanxi, Nanyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wuyi, and Tangxi. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to conduct preliminary surveys and designs in conjunction with the Fourth Special District. The estimated cost is 400 million yuan. The Fourth Special District Office has convened relevant county party and government officials, public opinion organizations, and local people to form a water conservancy advisory committee and engineering office to conduct actual measurements and prepare for immediate construction.</p>
<p>(4) The Puyang River flows through Yiwu, Pujiang, Zhuji, and other counties. The riverbed has long been neglected, and mountain floods are frequent, resulting in poor drainage, and farmland on both sides is often submerged. It is proposed to first carry out emergency flood control projects to alleviate the symptoms, which are estimated to cost 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is also planned to submit these two projects to the central government for allocation of funds, and to apply to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch for allocation of work relief materials, and to collect project beneficiary fees to handle them. In addition, there are flood control projects for the Xin'an River, Ling River, Ou River, Yong River, Feiyun River, and Bie River in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, but due to limited manpower and financial resources, it is planned to hold them next year.</p>
<p>(5) The Xiaoshan Nansha Soil Protection Project. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to survey and design. The first step is to build three training dikes to divert the flow of water, which is estimated to cost 1.7 billion yuan. Applications are being made to the central government and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch for allocation of funds and materials in order to start construction.</p>
<p>Agricultural Irrigation Projects</p>
<p>This province has successfully carried out agricultural irrigation projects during the war to cooperate with agricultural production and supply military provisions and civilian food. However, due to difficult circumstances and meager expenses, the projects have not been implemented according to plan, or there are many places where the projects have been implemented and then stopped. This year, they should continue to be carried out to completion. They are divided into large and small categories, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>Large Agricultural Irrigation Projects</p>
<p>(A) Linhai Taozhu District Irrigation Project: The dredging project in this area has completed 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork in previous years, and the Donggang Gate has also been partially constructed. This year, due to the suspension of water conservancy taxes and the lack of funds, the project has been suspended. After redesign, the projects in Jiaobei and Nantian districts are combined, with a total estimated cost of 895 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for approval of 350 million yuan, and it has been agreed to allocate 247,580 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch in advance. Work can be resumed in the short term, and more than 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit after completion.</p>
<p>(B) Pingyang Nangang District Drainage Project: This area is located on the south bank of the Bie River in Pingyang and is the main drainage channel for more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the area. Due to silt accumulation and the disrepair of the original sluice gates, the storage and drainage have become ineffective, affecting agricultural production. In 1942, the surveying team stationed in Zhejiang from the North China Water Conservancy Commission first carried out surveying. This year, the Water Conservancy Bureau reorganized and redesigned it based on its survey results. It is planned to rebuild three sluice gates first, which are estimated to cost 690 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for inclusion in the National Post-War Relief Fund for allocation of funds for construction. 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit after the project is completed.</p>
<p>(C) Pingyang Beigang District Drainage Project: It is planned to dredge the channels and use water pumps. The Water Conservancy Bureau has completed the survey and design. The estimated cost is 620 million yuan. It has been submitted to the central government for allocation of funds together with the Nangang District project. 20,000 mu of farmland will benefit after the project is completed.</p>
<p>(D) Qu County Shishi Weir Irrigation Project: The weir should be rebuilt with sluice gates and the channels should be rectified to facilitate irrigation and navigation. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to complete the survey and design. The estimated cost is 500 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for inclusion in the Post-War Relief Fund for allocation of funds for handling. 110,000 mu of farmland can benefit after the project is completed.</p>
<p>(E) Construction of Sluice Gates in the Yongrui Coastal Area: The Yongjia and Ruian counties' coastal and river areas' sluice gates were first started in January 1944 at Dongshan, Shangping, Huqiao, and Maozhu, but were suspended due to enemy troop movements. Construction resumed in July 1945, but was suspended again due to lack of funds. This year, the Water Conservancy Bureau selected Guanghua, Neiwai, Yunting, Dongmen, and Huqiao, and the estimated cost is 407.6 million yuan. The wages portion has been agreed to allocate 325,500 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief. The Eighth Special District Office has been ordered to resume construction. Approximately 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit from the project.</p>
<p>(F) Qu County Wuping Weir Irrigation Project: Because the original water inlet of the weir is easily silted up, a new inlet must be opened, a sluice gate built, the main branch channel rectified, and north-south branching gates built. Construction started in 1942, and most of the 12-kilometer-long channel earthwork has been completed, but it was suspended due to enemy movements. This year, the bureau redesigned it according to the original plan, requiring 143.909675 million yuan. The wages portion has been agreed to allocate 190,890 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief. The county has been ordered to organize a construction organization to resume work as soon as possible. Once the project is completed, 60,000 mu of farmland will benefit.</p>
<p>(G) Jinhua Hu Haitang Irrigation Project: If the pond is dredged and the ditches are excavated, 12,000 mu of farmland can be irrigated, and the water level difference can be used to build a hydropower plant to generate 474 horsepower to supply electricity for lighting and industrial power. A preliminary survey has been completed, and the estimated cost is 420 million yuan. Detailed surveying and design are currently being prepared.</p>
<p>(H) Yueqing Wanqiao Port Gate Construction Project: The project was first partially completed by the county in 1938. This year, the bureau plans to continue construction, with an estimated cost of 557.6 million yuan. 160,000 mu of farmland will benefit, and an application for work relief has been submitted to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch.</p>
<p>(I) Huangyan Yongning River Irrigation Project: The project has long been surveyed and designed, with an estimated cost of 1 billion yuan. 200,000 mu of farmland will benefit. The plan has been issued to the county for preparation, and a request for funds has been submitted to the central government, and a request for materials and equipment has been submitted to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch.</p>
<p>(J) Dongqian Lake Irrigation Project: The plan has been roughly approved, and it is planned to dredge, build dikes, and repair gates to facilitate irrigation. The reorganization committee is planning to handle it.</p>
<p>Small Agricultural Irrigation Projects</p>
<p>This province carries out small agricultural irrigation projects. The focus of the plains areas is on irrigation, drainage, and the restoration of polders. The mountainous counties mainly focus on digging ponds to store water and repairing gates and dams. However, the projects are fragmented and the area is vast. The province has traditionally adopted a province-directed, county-managed approach to ensure universality. This year, this method will continue to be promoted. The bureau will assign technicians to patrol the area and provide guidance, and the provincial government will issue an order to all counties to survey and estimate all projects to be carried out this year before the end of September, and prepare implementation plans by November 1. All counties will start construction at the same time, using national compulsory labor to carry them out universally. The necessary expenses are estimated at 5 million able-bodied men in the province, each working for ten days in accordance with the Compulsory Labor Law, for a total of 50 million workdays. At one cubic meter per workday, 50 million cubic meters of earthwork can be done. In addition to collecting project beneficiary fees or borrowing accumulated grain, the province will also negotiate with the China Farmers Bank to handle small agricultural loans. In the first half of this year, the head office of China Farmers Bank approved a loan amount of 11.5 million yuan, which was distributed to the first, third, and fifth districts at 1.4 million yuan each, the second and eleventh districts at 1.2 million yuan each, and the fourth district at 1.6 million yuan. The remaining 3.3 million yuan will be distributed to other districts as needed. In July, the head office of China Farmers Bank approved a loan of 100 million yuan, and distributed it to the first, second, and eleventh districts at 12 million yuan each, the third, fourth, fifth, and tenth districts at 10 million yuan each, and the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts at 6 million yuan each. It is now planned to continue to borrow 400 million yuan from China Farmers Bank to assist, and is currently in negotiations. In addition, in accordance with the small work relief measures announced by the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch, applications can be made to allocate materials and carry out work relief. The projects that have been applied for include the Lishui Haoxi Weir, the Yiyao Andong Dike Construction, the Shangchu Canal Improvement, and the excavation of ponds, the Qingyuan Wu Ba Du, the Jinyun Mingshan Fan, the Songyang Suburbs, the Yongkang Suburbs, and other water conservancy projects, as well as the Wukang Xiaoxi Town Restoration, the Zhenhai River Dredging, the Wenling Kaixi Musha River, the Deqing Dike Construction and River Dredging, the Wuxing River Dredging, the Zhuji Jiuli Reservoir Construction, the Pingyang Wanjin District River Dredging, the Jiangshan Dike and Dam Construction, the Haiyan South Lake Dredging, and the Shouchang Lvhe Pond Restoration.</p>
<p>Hydropower Projects</p>
<p>The rivers in this province originate in mountainous areas, with steep slopes and rapid flows, and rich water resources. If they are used to build hydropower plants, it will be helpful for industrial construction. Those that have been successfully built in the past include the Yunhe Suburbs Hydropower Plant. The ones that have been built and completed this year include the Suichang Longtan and the Longquan Suburbs. The ones that are being planned include Fenghua Xikou, Longyou Lingshan Town, Qu County Shishi Weir, Qingyuan Wu Ba Du, Jinyun Mingshan Fan, Quanhua Hu Haitang, Wukang Sibu Hall, Pingyang Nanyandang, and Yiwu Futang. The Water Conservancy Bureau also plans to build a large-scale hydropower plant at Qililong in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. If it can be realized, it can supply electricity for city lights and industry in the counties along the Qiantang River, which will be very effective. As for the Ou River, the Nantian Baizhang Waterfall in Qingtian can also be used for power generation, but the costs of these two projects are huge, so they will be planned first, and will be developed in the future. The Resources Committee has been asked to send personnel to assist in the implementation.</p>
<p>Achievements in Water Conservancy over the Years</p>
<p>The water conservancy cause in Zhejiang Province had a good scale before the war during the time of Director Zhang of the Water Conservancy Bureau. During the war, while Chairman Huang Wu was in the front lines, he still actively promoted economic construction, and the agricultural irrigation and hydropower projects received loans and technical assistance from China Farmers Bank, which achieved considerable results. The hydraulic engine created by the Zhejiang Iron Works was particularly excellent. Chairman Shen and Director Pi of the Water Conservancy Department also paid special attention to water conservancy. This city’s winter supervision and direction of the large-scale mobilization of civil labor in various districts and counties to carry out water conservancy and transportation is still a decisive policy. The establishment of the Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau was able to focus on the dedicated work of the engineers. The restoration of the stone embankment work, the enthusiastic support of Director Sun Zhu of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and expert Marshall Moore-Gage of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, approved the allocation of 13,000 tons of flour to carry out work relief. Sun Choupei, the technical specialist and director of China Farmers Bank, and the supervisors of the China Farmers Bank Quadruple General Office, were concerned about the water conservancy of this province, and the amount of loans was gradually increased, which was also a timely help to promote the work. As for the administrative supervision area's establishment of the river basin water conservancy advisory committee according to orders, such as Chen Qinshi, Jiang Mingsan, Zhu Mingtao, Qu Wenliu, Zhang Qiang, and Lu Gongwang, all were extraordinarily enthusiastic about the local water conservancy cause and provided leadership in many ways, according to the original plan, weighing priorities, distinguishing urgency, and repairing in order. I have now accompanied Director Pi to Beijing to present the complete project plan to Minister Xue of the Agricultural and Forestry Department and Director Xue of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, and Director Xue has agreed to allocate large sums, which can be combined with the relief goods of the Relief Administration to seize the time and promote the work. It is hoped that all advanced personnel in the engineering world and local talents will assist at any time, then the entire project will not be difficult to implement gradually.</p>

<h3 id="e197">A Compass for Single Women <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Yabo from Magazine Digest</p>
<p>This article is written for one in four American women who, whether they want to or not, will never find a husband. Roughly four million American women, between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, will never marry.</p>
<p>But first, women should understand how this problem arose.</p>
<p>Firstly, the mortality rate for men has always been higher than for women. Even before the war, according to statistics collected by the New York Daily News, there were already 730,129 more women than men in the United States.</p>
<p>In World War II, 380,000 American men died, and at least 400,000 more veterans returned with mental or physical injuries that made them unable to marry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one in ten men is stubbornly committed to bachelorhood, and this proportion is likely even higher among veterans. Another factor is that many soldiers returned to find their girlfriends several years older; as a result, they abandoned them and married their eighteen-year-old sisters. The original girlfriends were thus left without husbands.</p>
<p>Where Should She Live?</p>
<p>Where is it appropriate for a lifelong single woman to live?</p>
<p>Many women continue to live with their parents until old age. Some continue to manage the household after one of their parents passes away, especially when there are younger siblings in the family.</p>
<p>Some parents often rely on the meager salaries earned by a single daughter to support the family, while her married brothers or sisters, despite having better incomes, provide no assistance at all. In such cases, if the married sister living with them needs to go out, she expects the single sister to take care of the children.</p>
<p>Ms. Ruth Reed tells us about a clever single woman who created a budget for family expenses, asking her married brothers and sisters living with her to share a portion of the household costs, which she collected monthly. This way, she maintained a very harmonious relationship with her entire family.</p>
<p>If a single woman lives in a public dormitory, she will encounter many difficult problems: a lack of privacy and quiet, interference from the landlord, a lack of security, and no private property...</p>
<p>Most authorities agree that a single woman should have her own personal home, even if it's just a one-room apartment. A former headmistress of a girls' school for many years said, "When I had my own apartment, the greatest joy was knowing that I could get complete rest at night because no students would disturb me."</p>
<p>Some women express happiness because they have their own furniture. Even if it's just a few pieces of furniture moved from her parents' house, it can evoke all sorts of emotions from the past. Still other women who previously disliked managing household affairs now find interest in making beds and cooking meals, because it prevents them from being bored all day long.</p>
<p>However, many women living alone do not pay attention to preparing their meals properly. Why is the mortality rate for single women over sixty higher than for married women of the same age? This is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Some single women have partially solved this problem—several of them live together. If they get along well, organizing a joint household is a very ideal method, as they can share expenses and become good companions.</p>
<p>What About Romantic Emotions?</p>
<p>Romantic love is generally recognized as a normal part of the marriage process. Statistics tell us that a single woman over the age of thirty has very little chance of getting married. Albert Bennett said in his book "The Foundations of Feminism": "Know that marriage is a full-time business. It offers people an opportunity to obtain happiness, but it does not guarantee that happiness; divorces in court can prove this point."</p>
<p>However, unmarried women face a complex emotional problem in their personal lives. Reverend Herbert A. Gray said in his book "Men, Women, and God": "Her fate contains hidden pressures, unfulfilled desires, and occasional depression. Around the ages of twenty-five to thirty, this depression becomes exceptionally acute."</p>
<p>Dr. Gray advocates that single women must embrace a philosophy of self-reliance and be determined to become useful members of society. Let her understand that most of the practically valuable work—the work that has shaped today's culture, such as educating children, caring for the sick, and helping the poor—can be done by single women. Therefore, it should be recognized that single women are extremely needed members of society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, almost every man has been directly or indirectly blessed by a single woman; an elderly aunt or sister initially helped him to gain a foothold in society. This is a very common occurrence.</p>
<p>If you do not want to rely on your relatives or charitable organizations to help you in your old age, then you should set aside a portion of your earnings each month as savings while you are still earning money.</p>
<p>Take the Helm of Your Life</p>
<p>A woman needs to love others and to be loved by others; however, this does not necessarily mean romantic love. It means service to others. Dr. Gray said: "The best way to receive love is to extend love to others." When people feel the pain of loneliness, it is mainly the loneliness of the heart. But the most useless thing is for a person to sit idly by, feeling depressed and waiting for someone to love her. That is truly a desperate path.</p>
<p>One single woman solved her troubles by using her free time to work in a nursery school. Another self-pitying woman found happiness by wholeheartedly immersing herself in social service. Still another shy and timid woman found satisfaction by successfully leading a study group in a church.</p>
<p>A Ms. JM learned excellent cooking skills, and her "apartment" dinners have become a highly engaging activity in her circle of friends.</p>
<p>A Ms. MacD developed a passion for photography, thus finding a solution to her loneliness. Initially, an elderly relative gave her a camera, so she joined a photography study group. Now she has opened her own photography studio, thus earning double the income. This business is not only extremely interesting to her, but also allows her to connect with many like-minded friends.</p>
<p>For Ms. K, her solution is travel. Every summer, she travels to various different places, scenic spots, and historical sites, and makes at least one new friend on each trip.</p>
<p>Finally, there remains the question of sexual urges. According to doctors, a normal sexual relationship should be part of everyone's life. However, many people live without this kind of life and are still able to adapt to this environment happily.</p>
<p>As Freud pointed out, the danger of complete abstinence—suppressing normal desires altogether—can produce a functional neurosis. This is something that many single women naturally encounter.</p>
<p>The antidote to functional neurosis is to redirect sexual urges to other avenues, such as work, research, or hobbies. Freud said: "There is no shortage of young scientists who are celibate; these celibate scientists are able to devote more energy to their scientific endeavors."</p>
<p>Single women naturally have many problems, but their problems may not be as numerous as those of their married sisters. The happiness of single women depends entirely on their ability to steer their own course in a beneficial direction, to find their own path in life, and to devote themselves to work, hobbies, and the position their family should occupy. Most importantly, it is that she has her own place among other people. (Translated from the November 1946 issue of "Magazine Digest.")</p>

<h3 id="e199">Milk Talk <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Anonymous</p>
<p>Now that winter is here, people are using milk as a nourishing drink. Here are a few pieces of knowledge about milk, published below, for the reference of housewives.</p>
<p>Milk contains calcium and phosphorus, a lot of vitamins A and C, and a considerable amount of vitamins B and E.</p>
<p>If milk is heated to 63 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, the pathogens will be completely eliminated, and the composition of the milk will remain completely unchanged, identical to raw milk. If you let it boil, all the important nutrients in it, such as vitamins, will lose a large part, so its effectiveness will also be weakened.</p>
<p>Milk coagulates into lumps in the stomach. Swallowing it in large gulps will cause it to coagulate into a large mass, while taking it in small sips will form small lumps, so it is advisable to drink milk slowly. Because small lumps are easier to digest than large masses.</p>
<p>Milk and vinegar should not be eaten together, otherwise, the abdomen often has bursts of cramping pain, which is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even sterilized milk can spoil if left for a long time. A simple way to test milk is to invert the milk bottle. If white solids rise, it is evidence of spoilage.</p>
<p>Milk production varies greatly depending on the breed of cow. The most productive breed is Holstein; it produces an average of 15 liters of milk per day, with approximately 300 milking days per year.</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the average annual per capita consumption of milk is approximately 53 liters for the British and 116 liters for the Americans. Swiss consumption is also quite substantial. There are no statistics for China.</p>
<p>The only food that is universally popular in the world is milk. In Roman times, the Greeks considered milk to be food for children and uncivilized countries.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Importance of Maternal Love <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yingwu</p>
<p>Maternal education is the fundamental education of life. The greatness of its power is sufficient to complete an individual's personality, promote social progress, strengthen national development, and enhance human happiness. In our country's society, ethical thought and family concepts are particularly strong. Parents are both the head of the family, but the father is often unable to balance work and family due to various constraints. Therefore, the mother actually becomes the closest person to the children in the family, and the mother's words and actions have the deepest impact on the children. Therefore, the importance of maternal education is indeed undeniable.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the term "maternal education," it is said to have originated from the Yilin written by Jiao Yanshou of the Han Dynasty. The Yilin says: "Losing hold of maternal education, a good match elopes." This is the beginning of the term "maternal education." However, the fact of maternal education has existed since ancient times. In Chinese history, there are countless examples of excellent mothers, such as Mencius's mother moving three times to choose a neighborhood and cutting the loom to teach her son; Tao's mother cutting her hair to entertain guests and reprimanding her son for accepting salted fish; Ou's mother teaching her son with reeds and Liu's mother teaching her son with pills, and the mothers of Uncle Ao teaching their sons with wisdom, and Wangsun teaching their sons with loyalty, all of which shine in history and set a maternal model for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Why is the power of maternal education so great? Because children have the closest relationship with their mothers after they are born. A mother's breastfeeding and cuddling both affect the child, and this influence is an educational effect. And the education received in infancy often affects a lifetime. Therefore, Chinese and foreign educators all emphasize education in infancy when discussing children's education. The proverb says, "Teach the wife when she first arrives, teach the child in infancy," which means to emphasize infant education. Child psychologist Freud said: "The basic habits of mankind are mostly established in childhood." Mental hygiene expert Dr. Knight said: "Childhood is the golden age for implementing mental hygiene." From these points, we can see the importance of education in infancy. Because children are most susceptible to external stimuli. A newborn baby is like a blank sheet of paper. The first color that is applied leaves the deepest mark and is never easy to remove. For example, if a newborn baby cries, and you hug or rock him, it won't take a week before he will desperately want you to hug and rock him. Therefore, good and bad habits are formed from a young age. Especially habits formed in childhood, and will affect a lifetime. The great British naturalist Darwin's family produced outstanding scholars for generations, especially his mother, who was a famous virtuous mother, so someone came to her to ask her at what age the education of children should begin, and she asked: "How old is your child now?" The man replied, "Just one and a half years old." Darwin's mother then replied: "The opportunity to educate your child has already been delayed by one and a half years."</p>
<p>Therefore, the education of children should start from the time they are born, and it must be taught well from the beginning. If it is not taught well from the beginning, it will be difficult to teach well later. In the past, a qin teacher issued an enrollment advertisement, which said: "The tuition for those who have not learned the qin is one yuan, and the tuition for those who have already learned it is two yuan." This means that not teaching well from the beginning is not only useless, but also harmful. Therefore, we can say that the day a child is born is the time he begins to be educated. His future achievements depend on the basic education he receives. Because the mother has a close relationship with the child, especially infants during the breastfeeding period, they cannot be separated from the mother at any time, so the mother is indeed the child's first teacher. Even for older children, because they have the most contact with their mother in their living environment, they are most influenced by their mother. Therefore, the importance of maternal education cannot be denied by anyone.</p>

<p>— Bailiu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I fear the long winter nights.</p>
<p>Because, in sleepless nights, I feel even colder and lonelier, even when wrapped in a warm quilt, and even when accompanied by the snores of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in sleepless nights, I always hope to see the lights of night travelers flickering through the window, and I also hope to hear the footsteps of night travelers—even if it is the visit of a thief.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The person who once punched me on the bridge of my nose, ten years later today, is the new appointee who has come to take over my position with a smile.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I hate a detestable face, a face I encountered on the bus some time ago. I had thought to myself, I would never encounter a second detestable face like this in my life. But, heavens, who would have thought that this face would actually be seen a second time, and still on the bus?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Is the world too big? The world is too small!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>I fear entering any gathering place.</p>
<p>Shaking hands with this person, and then shaking hands with that person—shaking back and forth, but never touching a truly warm hand.</p>
<p>I don't want to speak insincerely, but I can't bear to listen to other people's "high-minded arguments," because I always feel that the voice is not coming from the speaker's heart.</p>
<p>"Not a single decent person, not a single decent word." I like these two lines from your play, Cao Yu, you scoundrel.</p>
<p>I don't admit that this mood of mine is a sign of fading youth. On the contrary, I secretly rejoice, because the desire to seek "truth" and love "truth" is even stronger.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>I thank a gentleman for telling me the truth:</p>
<p>"I often see your name, but to be honest, I have never read a single word of your great works."</p>
<p>Isn't this how many people become famous?</p>
<p>I understand why "prolific writers" have to be so prolific.</p>
<p>I understand why some people use newspapers to publish their names several times.</p>
<p>I understand...</p>
<p>This world recognizes names, not the people those names represent.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>I was sitting in a speeding carriage.</p>
<p>Coming towards us, another speeding carriage. I watched it being hit by a truck. The poor skinny horse fell, and the coachman and passengers all fell into the street because the carriage shaft was broken.</p>
<p>The driver of the carriage I was in let out a joyful laugh.</p>
<p>This cannot be explained merely by "competitors are enemies." "Compassion" no longer has a place in people's hearts today. This driver is just one person.</p>
<p>That laughter sends shivers down my spine whenever I think of it.</p>
<p>No wonder I always think of loneliness in the midst of excitement.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Yes, I always think of loneliness in the midst of excitement. This feeling is like—</p>
<p>The lingering smoke from a cigarette butt thrown into an ashtray after a night of dancing;</p>
<p>Like—</p>
<p>The lingering scent of wine after a feast has ended;</p>
<p>Like—</p>
<p>The sigh of a lonely night traveler in the dark night;</p>
<p>Like—</p>
<p>The staggering footsteps of a lover returning from the battlefield of love.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>I once had the idea of converting to a religion, but this idea is still just an idea. It is now, and it will certainly be in the future. The reason is that I already have a piety towards life that is beyond that of a religious person. The wounds suffered from reality cannot be healed by the unrealistic language and fantasies of religion. Heaven? Can warmth be found in heaven?</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>Crying and laughing are two magic weapons that mankind uses to fill loneliness.</p>
<p>However, laughter does not fully possess this effect. Because laughter is not always filled with true emotion. Hypocrisy is the cause of loneliness, so hypocritical laughter naturally increases the loneliness in people's hearts.</p>
<p>Liar, don't grin and make an ugly laugh; if you want to cry, why don't you cry? Tears can wash away the dirt in your heart and fill the emptiness in other people's hearts. Why do you insist on suppressing crying with laughter?</p>

<p>Double-pupiled Xiang Yu, his achievements faded and fell. At the Wujiang crossing, singing rose, Chu songs sounded, sadly distraught. Recalling the events of that year, heaven doomed me, not the battle. Han Dan searched, the Hongmen Banquet, also glorious. His strength uprooted mountains, covering the world's heroic dreams, his豪氣 soared. Look at the elders who continue his martial exploits, all of Europe surrendered. Pipes and drums compete to sound, a continent is startled.</p>
<p>I ask, the Rhine River, Ah Peak Snow, after the turmoil, how many times have you looked back? At times, I suddenly feel that my heart is still strong, my aspirations are not yet fulfilled, so I embark on a Long March.

<p>— Yun Xi</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, come in and sit!" Mrs. Ding was standing at her gate again, calling out in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>It really was my bad luck; having walked past this grassy path beside the lotus pond three times, I was stopped by Mrs. Ding each time with a soul-calling shout. I hesitated, really torn: if I answered, it would be the same old platitudes, my ears were already calloused from them; if I turned and ran, wouldn't I look like a child afraid of a drowned ghost, and become a laughingstock?</p>
<p>Helpless, I hardened my scalp and strolled over as if nothing were happening.</p>
<p>"Come, come, Mr. Lin, come in and sit, come in and sit."</p>
<p>"No, I want to go home."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, Mr. Lin, it's a rare occasion!"</p>
<p>I chuckled inwardly, having come twice in half a month, and she still called it a rare occasion?</p>
<p>"No need, I'll come again next time."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, just sit for a little while, it doesn't matter, come in and sit, standing makes your feet ache!..." Her yellow and thin fingers tightly gripped my sleeve, and without allowing any argument, she pulled me inside.</p>
<p>The ancient hall, once again capturing me with its gray and dim wings; the musty smell made me nauseous...</p>
<p>After serving black tea, her first words were:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you know how Ah-xian is doing out there?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel indignant. Yes, I knew Ding Jixian, with his aubergine face and blinking eyes every two seconds, now studying in Shanghai. But that was all; I had never been his follower, never been commissioned as an information gatherer, so to keep pestering me for details, like a shop assistant pestering for old debts, was simply absurd! However, in front of such an oddly kind, oddly solicitous woman, was there any room for you to bang the table, stomp your feet, and glare?</p>
<p>"Um, um," I said.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, I mean, how is our son doing in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Him, I'm not very clear, I know he's studying in some middle school."</p>
<p>"That's good then... Mr. Lin, I'm easily swayed by what I hear, Zhang Guicai, the small boss of the Jinfeng Silk Shop in town, do you know him, Mr. Lin?—He said that our Jixian is not well-behaved out there. I said, what is that supposed to mean? Our Ah-xian has always been well-behaved, what's not well-behaved?... But, although I said that, after he said that, I can't help but worry..."</p>
<p>The aunt's complaints, this time, were finally uprooted.</p>
<p>"Which mother isn't like this," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Lin, raising a child is not an easy task! Our Ah-xian is already the third one, the first two, his brothers A-long and A-yun, didn't grow up much before they went away alive... Speaking of our A-long, Mr. Lin, my tears have been flowing and haven't dried up yet! Just think, that killer—her husband—scared his little life away with his fierce appearance, isn't that a sin?... Mr. Lin, listen to me, that night, I had already put our A-long to bed, the killer came back drunk, aggressive, and insisted on the land deed again. You think, such little capital to live on, how could I give it to him casually, so I ignored him a thousand times... Who knew, he took a kitchen knife from the kitchen and swung it at my head, threatening to kill me. I thought, kill me, you don't have that much courage, so I wasn't afraid, and said: Okay, you dare, dare to kill me! Who knew, the kitchen knife really came down, I quickly turned my head, the knife hit the pillow, grazing my ear, and immediately there was a pool of blood. At that time, I didn't even know I was in pain, I was busy taking care of our A-long, who had already been awakened by the fright and was wailing. The killer vented his anger on his head, raised the knife, shouting that he would kill the little ghost, I hugged A-long, my whole body was shaking, A-long's two little shoulders were also shaking... " On her old face, wrinkled like dried dates, tears flowed freely. Trembling, she used a large and dirty handkerchief to wipe them away, and continued, choking:</p>
<p>"Just like that, our A-long got sick from fright, sought gods and medicine, but it couldn't be cured..."</p>
<p>I nodded, but wasn't saddened. – I'd heard this story from others, from the aunt herself, more than three times. But in any case, in this ancient hall, facing such a sad old woman, it was, after all, extremely embarrassing. – I got up to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"No, no, Mr. Lin, don't rush off, sit, sit a little longer..." She grabbed my sleeve again, "You, you have tea, look, you haven't drunk the tea yet. — Oh dear, the tea is cold, look at me... scatterbrained, I'll change it for you..."</p>
<p>She was busy changing my tea, urging me to drink, her emotions gradually calmed down, and after sitting down again, she began to vigorously rummage through the pocket inside her jacket, and after a long while, carefully took out a wrinkled envelope.</p>
<p>"Look, Mr. Lin, this is A-xian's recent letter, saying he needs to pay tuition again... This semester's tuition is really high, it comes to hundreds of thousands."</p>
<p>I opened the letter.</p>
<p>"Mother, I prostrate myself: Your son at school is being asked to pay a second installment of tuition fees amounting to 200,000, food expenses are 150,000, and your son also needs 200,000 for pocket money, totaling 550,000. It must be brought out by someone convenient at the end of this month, very important, very important!... "</p>
<p>I was surprised. Didn't the aunt clearly tell me that A-xian had already paid 200,000 in tuition, why is there a second installment? Obviously, this guy, relying on the old practices of the previous two semesters, has told a big lie?</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, you say, how can tuition be so high! 200,000, and another 200,000, it wasn't this high before!... How can tuition be even higher after the war is going well?... " Her two confused eyes stared at me, as if helpless, and as if trying to find an explanation on my face.</p>
<p>"This semester's tuition is especially high compared to before, so the teachers' salaries are much better."</p>
<p>Saying this, I immediately felt ashamed in my heart.</p>
<p>"You only told half the truth! You shouldn't hide the truth about your son from your mother!" It seemed as if such a voice was resounding, warning me, gnawing at my conscience, causing pain.</p>
<p>"Tell her the whole story," I murmured to myself.</p>
<p>"But the aunt is stubborn, she only believes her own son, she doesn't believe Zhang Guicai's words, will she believe my words? Being too enthusiastic will only cause trouble, such a nagging and self-confident woman, can you disentangle yourself from her?... "</p>
<p>Conflicting thoughts rushed up, swallowing the words that were about to leave my lips. – A burst of enthusiasm suddenly cooled down.</p>
<p>My eyes swept over her old face, wrinkled like dried water chestnuts, and I really felt very sorry.</p>
<p>"The tuition is high, I won't mention it. I say our A-xian is really pitiful, living in Shanghai, and the family doesn't have much money, once the tuition is paid, there's not much left for pocket money, so he wrote to complain. People don't know, they think it's hundreds of thousands, but in reality, it's all for proper expenses, he hasn't spent it recklessly... Fortunately, in the summer vacation next year, he says he can graduate from middle school, and he'll finally have a chance to get ahead... "</p>
<p>"Woof woof... woof woof woof..." The sound of dogs barking chaotically at the door. The aunt hurriedly limped out to look, and then came back in.</p>
<p>"Wild dogs are so annoying, always fighting here—I thought there was a guest."</p>
<p>"Um, um—" I stood up to leave.</p>
<p>"Don't rush off, Mr. Lin," she ran close to me, her mouth almost touching my face, and asked softly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you know if our A-xian has a sweetheart in Shanghai?... Why does he always say slowly when we try to find him a wife?... What is she like, a charmer? Mr. Lin, just tell me, I won't be angry..."</p>
<p>"This, I really don't know."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, you don't know, I was just guessing, guessing... Mr. Lin, when you go to Shanghai, please inquire for me... Cough cough, you tell him, if he has someone he likes, discuss it with me too, don't always be at odds with your mother!...</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," I replied, stepping out the door.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, when are you going to Shanghai? When you're about to go, stop by here, I have something to ask you..." The aunt's dry and hoarse voice rang behind me.</p>
<p>As I walked, a blurry scene appeared before my eyes. I seemed to see the aunt limping, climbing a mountain path, she bravely climbed the mountain of "husband"; in a flash, she lost her footing and fell. – How heavy, how deep the fall! Then she licked her wounds, mustered her courage, and climbed towards another mountain. The words "son" were engraved on this mountain. Panting, stumbling, stepping on jagged rocks and thorny bushes, she climbed up, confident in her heart, she saw a glimmering light, reflected in her blurred old eyes... She was sure that soon, this blurred light would shine in her eyes, and she would be able to grasp it firmly...</p>
<p>However, that mountain had begun to shake and was about to collapse...</p>
<p>You can naturally guess the outcome...</p>
<h3 id="e205">Boat Women – Continued Yangzhou Dreams, Part 7 <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Wei Fa</p>
<p>As far as this writer's memory goes, the pleasure boats on the Slender West Lake seem to have become smaller and smaller with the evolution of the times. In the past, large painted boats were large enough to hold banquets. Not counting the boatmen, servants, and cooks, there were even powdered and rouged women to pour wine and play music. Such painted boats naturally had to be very large, with railings on both sides and a flying canopy above. Inside, there were also many furnishings. Such painted boats can no longer be seen today. The ones that can be seen now are much smaller, and the arrangements, etc., are far inferior to what they used to be. Even these relatively small painted boats seem to have lost their youth, revealing a state of decline, and are no longer favored by tourists. A scattered few are quietly waiting for families of all ages to patronize them.</p>
<p>In recent years, the boats on the lake that come and go are mostly of a very small type, commonly known as small rowboats. These small rowboats have clean white cloth canopies, supported by iron bars on all sides. The canopy holds a few rattan deck chairs, and there is also a small wooden table for placing tea sets. It is very comfortable for three or four people to sit in one boat. The boat is small, fast, and maneuverable when cruising the lake, so it is naturally loved by most people.</p>
<p>However, the large painted boats have been eliminated with the evolution of the times, and the small rowboats have emerged in response to the times. This is certainly the most significant change on the Slender West Lake in recent years, but in this writer's observation, there is another feeling of vicissitude that arises between the pre-war and post-war periods, which is that some of the boat women who pole the small rowboats have also changed. The boat women before the war seemed to have certain requirements in terms of clothing. They were mostly black silk trousers and white cloth shirts. Such attire, set against the deep green vegetation, was like a carefree seagull that was not easily seen on the lake, and was naturally very pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, many were in their prime, with quite a few having delicate features. Under the condition of "knowing good looks, then admiring young women," their life of poling boats on the lake would undoubtedly be more prosperous than that of the other vulgar boatmen. In addition, their boat-poling skills were also very good. Holding a bamboo pole, they poled very nimbly. No matter how far they went, with each up and down movement of the pole, their clothes would not be splashed with a single drop of water. That kind of nimble body and skilled technique, like music having rhythm, if you lay in a rattan chair and watched with a discerning eye, you could not help but secretly admire it.</p>
<p>Young people are always active and competitive. Seeing the boat women's skill in poling boats, they would happily learn, asking the boat women to sit in the boat while they poled. The boat women, watching them sometimes struggle with the pole, causing the small rowboat to spin around on the lake, or pole awkwardly, splashing water all over their bodies when they pulled up the pole, would giggle in a group. In the willow shade on this side, beside the reeds on that side, the laughter rising and falling was often strung together in a series, and then slowly subsided, finally sinking into the lake breeze. This was truly a wonderful embellishment on the lake. Unfortunately, boat women with delicate features are now rarely seen, and their clothing is not as neat as it used to be. Even their boat-poling skills do not seem as skilled as they used to be. This is a disaster brought about by the war. Decaying Yangzhou can no longer withstand such a disaster!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Pingzi sobbed for a while, then, turning her back to Tsurumi, took out a handkerchief to dry her tears. Suddenly, she turned around again, looked up at Tsurumi with her face raised, and forced a smile:</p>
<p>"Brother, I'm terribly sorry. Someone as moody as me must be repulsive to you... But I don't know why I suddenly felt so sad." Pingzi said, seeing the look of panic on Tsurumi's face, and couldn't help but feel a little lost. Although she smiled weakly, two large tears welled up in the corners of her eyes, shining brightly in the moonlight. "Brother, your willpower is stronger than my concentration; I don't have the ability to explore your heart." She admitted defeat.</p>
<p>"Pingzi, please don't blame me for being rude, but what exactly did you write on that little piece of paper?" Tsurumi wanted to find out how loyal this woman was to him. "That piece of paper has already been taken by that old man Konoe."</p>
<p>Pingzi seemed a little shy upon hearing this, and after a long pause, seeing that Tsurumi was still waiting for her reply, she lowered her head. "That was my own private matter, so I didn't want anyone to see it... It was a little poem that I like to read the most, I changed a few words in the first two lines—fourteen words in total, it was..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi really didn't want her to say those fourteen words, but she still recited those two lines with a shy smile on her face, and recited them twice. There was no need to doubt Pingzi's loyalty. However, at this moment, two conflicting thoughts arose in Tsurumi's mind—for the sake of the motherland, he could use any means necessary, even if it meant feigning love to drive this woman to cooperate with him, it wouldn't be considered immoral; for the sake of the motherland, everything should be sacrificed. But on the other hand, the method of using any means necessary should also have a limit, and the boundary of this limit should probably be the realm of personality. As a dignified man, even if he used any means necessary, he shouldn't violate the realm of personality.</p>
<p>He pondered for a while and decided to use Pingzi to cooperate, but not to deceive her, in order to maintain the dignity of his personality.</p>
<p>"Pingzi, there's something I have to say now: Can we draw a clearer line between public and private? In other words, we don't talk about love in official matters; in private matters, we don't involve official duties?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this sudden proposal, Pingzi first seemed to fall into a wave of panic, as if she didn't understand Tsurumi's intention. Then she felt that Tsurumi was testing her, to see if her love was firm and eternal. But digging deeper, she felt that Tsurumi was challenging her, because while she didn't deeply understand Tsurumi's political position, Tsurumi didn't seem to understand what banner she was carrying. She stared blankly at Tsurumi, lost in thought for quite a while:</p>
<p>"Please explain it a little more clearly, so that I can understand it thoroughly."</p>
<p>"It's very obvious, I'm not worth grabbing your weakness, to fool you, to use you!" Although Tsurumi's voice was very light and thin, very low, but in Pingzi's eardrum, it was as hard and fierce as thunder, "I remember you said that your father and the others think I'm going down the wrong path; you also said that you wouldn't explain. Now I really want to know their true position. That's one point. The second point is, I also want to know Elder Qingmu's opinion on the current situation. The third point is, I'm even more willing to understand your personal opinion—regarding the current situation!... But I'm ashamed to say that, until a sufficiently mature stage, I can't explain my true purpose to you. Before I can explain it, I don't want to fool you, I want to maintain my personality!"</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Reading the United Press report on the US Navy's Antarctic expedition may give us a certain feeling: the value of human life, some is brilliant and splendid, some is ordinary and colorless, what a huge disparity that is!</p>
<p>Life represents hope, with life, hope is endless, but this principle applies to everyone, it's just that the so-called value of hope must be assessed differently.</p>
<p>A telegram sent from the small warship Olympus on its way to Little America stated:</p>
<p>The USS Sennet, a submarine belonging to the US Navy Antarctic Expedition, will submerge under the ice upon reaching Antarctica, fire on the ice layer of the Ross Sea, and launch two torpedoes to see what happens. According to submarine captain Eisenhower: the ice block will not suffer any damage. The submarine has ten officers and seventy crew members, all of whom volunteered to participate in this expedition. The length of the underwater voyage, the cold climate, and the dangerous winds and waves will be the most experienced by the submarine USS Sennet.</p>
<p>These people are not fools, so why are they willing to take such risks, are they really tired of living? These people are not fools, on the contrary, they are the smartest people in the world. They spare no personal life as capital for the lives of the majority. How can human civilization and progress lack such fools?</p>
<p>Secondly, we think of the US Navy, which during this World War, in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and especially the Pacific, demonstrated its combat power, but once the war ended, they engaged in such scientific work, doing their best for the academic community. This phenomenon has allowed us to realize the inseparability of the forces of war and peace, breaking the narrow-minded concept of pure military affairs; at the same time, it also demonstrates that based on the standpoint of national defense, military equipment can also engage in various other activities, contributing to the country, the nation, and even the world.</p>
<p>Finding difficulties, overcoming difficulties, for safety, happiness, human activities are endless, but for oneself or one's own small circle, it is fundamentally worthless.</p>

<p>A Beggar's Humor</p>
<p>A ragged tramp in New York stopped a well-dressed man and said, "Sir, could you give me a dime? I'm so hungry I'm about to die." After the man gave him a dime, he couldn't help but say, "I'm afraid a dime won't buy any food in this day and age."</p>

<p>"The United States isn't arguing with Britain," Mom interrupted Dad, saying.</p>
<p>"Who said they were arguing?" Dad said, obviously angry: "I'm just using a hypothetical analogy to give the boy an example."</p>
<p>"That's absurd," Mom roared: "You're always instilling all sorts of wrong ideas into his head."</p>
<p>"What's absurd about it?" Dad said aggressively, "If he listens to you, he'll never have any ideas in his head."</p>
<p>The argument grew more and more heated. Just as it was becoming inextricable, the son spoke up. "Mom, thank you, Dad, thank you. Now I completely understand how wars start!"</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Organization of Beggars 17 <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The Northern Faction of Beggars in Shanghai</p>
<p>In Shanghai, besides the local beggar gangs, there are several types of beggar organizations. Among them, the "Hard Coercion Gang" is the most tightly organized and has the most ancient history, absolutely not comparable to the local beggar gangs that have sprung up halfway. The "Hard Coercion Gang" of beggars has a long history and belongs to a nationwide orthodox beggar organization. During the Qing Dynasty, the gang was thriving, with beggars spreading throughout the north and south of the country, even to remote areas. Because throughout the Qing Dynasty, the imperial court had issued "Imperial Edicts," bestowing beggar leaders with special permission to "beg at every door" and "set up factories in every city" and "establish units in every town," its influence was extraordinary. The "beggar factories," or commonly known as "beggar camps," that we are familiar with in various places belong to the "Hard Coercion Gang."</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major city that has risen to prominence in the last century and is located in the affluent southeastern region, so naturally, the "Hard Coercion Gang" would not ignore this lucrative opportunity. Beggar factories were established in Shanghai as early as the mid-Qing Dynasty. Although the details are unknown to the author, we only need to pay a little attention to see traces of the "Hard Coercion Gang" beggars still everywhere in this city, and we can imagine that their power is still not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>The "Hard Coercion Gang" spread from the north to the Jiangnan region. Just by listening to their language, one can tell that they have accents from north of the Yellow River. It is clear that there are no Jiangnan people mixed in this gang. The beggar leader is also called "Unit Head," and each beggar factory has only one. In the past, he had absolute authority over all beggars in Shanghai. According to the tradition of the beggar gang, the beggar leader had the power of "life and death." The gang's hierarchy was very strict, and its rules were extremely fair. In the former Qing Dynasty, any beggar who had not been "trained" could not beg in this city. Even beggars from other places had to go to pay respects to the beggar leader, known as "visiting the pier," before they could engage in begging in this city; otherwise, even finding a place to stay would be a problem. Even if they had savings and did not want to beg in this city, they still had to "visit the pier." This is a strict general rule in the world of beggars, respecting elders and honoring the old.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for readers to know which beggars belong to the "Hard Coercion Gang." Just look at the following categories, and you can find evidence from your memory. The meaning of the name "Hard Coercion" is "forceful begging." If you give him money, he will leave without thanking you. If you don't give him money, he will never leave empty-handed. He will either resist for a long time, show off his skills, or sing beggar songs. If you still don't give, he will cause a bloody incident at your door, called "hanging colors." However, he would never dare to cut your flesh but would cut his own flesh, spilling his own blood, making a bloody mess to escalate the situation. At this point, you have no choice but to give him money to get rid of them, but even then, they still refuse to leave, demanding at least ten times more money before they will go. These are the "evil beggars" we have always despised. They all have one or two special performance skills, described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Nose Tip Balancing"—Placing a short bamboo stick on the tip of the nose, with bowls and plates on the upper end, able to hold it for a long time without falling.</p>
<p>(2) "Lotus Drop"—Tapping bamboo clappers while singing a ditty; the rhythm is harmonious, and the song is long without repeating.</p>
<p>(3) "Azure Dragon"—Carrying a bamboo basket on the back, containing several green snakes. Always holding a snake in hand and playing with it.</p>
<p>(4) "Double Piercing"—Using an iron hook to pierce a hole in the side of the nose and another in the throat.</p>
<p>(5) "Brick Beating Street"—Hitting the chest with a brick, calling out along the street, using the beating of the chest as a rhythm, corresponding with the cries.</p>
<p>(6) "Phoenix Display"—Inserting a thin needle into the forehead, with the end of the needle supporting a bowl, singing songs while walking in a line.</p>
<p>After their performance, if they do not get money, they take out a bamboo flute from their colored bag and play it mournfully as a final warning. If they still do not get money, they take out a small sharp knife and cut their forehead, causing blood to flow down their face. They always beg in small groups of two or three people for mutual support.</p>

<p>During the War of Resistance, anyone who lived in Chongqing would know how formidable Mr. Chu was in the National Political Council. He criticized people as much as, or even more than, Huang Yanpei and Kong Geng. Before the victory, he, along with Zuo Shunsheng, Mo Dehui, and others, flew to Yan'an to mediate the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Although the mediation has not been successful to this day, as long as the door to peace is not closed, there is still a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Northern Expedition, he devoted himself to the revolution, contributing greatly. He is a prominent meritorious official in the history of the party and the nation. Mr. Chu is also happy to run education. In 1926, he co-founded the Law College with Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, and others. During the eight-year War of Resistance, Mr. Chu also ran a branch of the Shanghai Law College in Wanxian, Sichuan. After the victory, it was officially renamed Fucheng College in his honor.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu is still serving as the president of the Shanghai Law College.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Fucheng, also known as Huiyi, is from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He is frugal and lives a simple life. He always wears a blue cloth gown and cloth shoes. On rainy days, he wears rubber shoes at most. He is short in stature and walks with a slight sway. His face is thin and wears glasses. Wrinkles on his forehead further highlight his demeanor as a scholar who has experienced hardship.</p>
<p>This time, at the National Assembly, he advocated for postponement, hoping that the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would succeed, and they could jointly discuss national affairs. Therefore, he was late this time and only took the oath before the fifth meeting on the 30th of last month. As a representative of social luminaries, he attended the National Assembly and will surely make many contributions in the future.</p>

<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, around nine o'clock, I was held up by a friend for dinner. After chatting for a while, I was eager to go home, so I took a shortcut. As I turned into Yinghua Street, most of the shops along the way had already closed, and there were few pedestrians. I saw a rogue-like person on the opposite sidewalk, staring intently at an old man in his fifties or sixties, speaking in a strange tone. I assumed that he was probably soliciting him to see "erotic pictures" or "mirror grinding" and other obscene things. At first, he followed for a while and nothing happened. The old man walked faster and faster, trying to avoid the man's harassment, but the rogue, seeing no response, pursued him even more closely, constantly muttering those vulgar words. It seemed that the old man couldn't bear it anymore. He turned around, glared at the rogue, pointed his trembling finger, and cursed:</p>
<p>"You should look at people... Why are you staring at me? You scoundrel!"</p>
<p>The rogue was a little unconvinced and started to curse back with dirty words, almost getting physical. At this moment, three decently dressed men came out from the side, trying to persuade them. They pushed and shoved, and without the old man's consent, pushed him into a dark alley next to the Jingmei Restaurant! I couldn't help but feel strange. So I slowed down and watched the opposite side from afar, but I couldn't see anything clearly under the dim street light. Although I was very suspicious of the development of this strange drama.</p>
<p>I crossed to the other side, and then I heard a few people talking loudly as they walked by; listening carefully, it was about the aftermath of that strange drama. One of them said:</p>
<p>"These scoundrels are getting more and more lawless. It seems that the old man has suffered again."</p>
<p>"I don't think the old man's injuries are light! I don't know how they managed to get him into this alley... Alas! They beat him up and stripped him of his coat and all his clothes!" Another seemed a little sad.</p>
<p>"We should be careful on this road in the future!..."</p>
<p>After that, I sped up my pace because there was no need to listen anymore.</p>
<p>I feel that the methods of these criminals are getting more and more sophisticated. They can calmly lure people to secluded places to strike. Every time they are caught by the police, instead of repenting after being released, they increase their experience, making their methods more precise, and various plans emerge one after another, making it possible for people to fall into their trap anytime and anywhere. Now that the police are supposed to be more vigilant against petty criminals, it seems that they should be even more strict!</p>

<p>— Zhuo Qiu</p>
<p>There has been much discussion recently about the issue of whether or not to abolish the "rotating credit associations," but whether or not they can be banned is a matter of fact. Here, I will only talk about their current situation.</p>
<p>The term "rotating credit association" used to be popular only among the lower and middle classes of non-intellectuals, because the unusually high interest rates were indeed suspected of forming usury, which was not only despised by informed people, but also made the associations themselves difficult to sustain, and it can be said that nineteen out of ten died halfway.</p>
<p>Now, the industrial and commercial sectors are being squeezed internally by high interest rates and externally by taxes. Most are swaying in the storm. Financial institutions and other creditors are pressing for debt like bailiffs at the door. The bloodless usury will endlessly inflate the principal itself. Daily interest of tens or hundreds of thousands makes the productivity of an ordinary factory or store further and further away, approaching the eve of collapse.</p>
<p>The industrial and commercial sectors also know that forming a rotating credit association is like drinking poison to quench thirst, but they can't take out any more loans. They still want to try their best to support their own business, even if it means patching up the old to keep things going.</p>
<p>Small-scale rotating credit associations, with as little as thirty to fifty thousand yuan, are also very popular among factory workers and shop assistants. The meaning of these small organizations is similar to the former. It's nothing more than that in a situation of some urgent need, rather than attempting usury, it is better to "treat symptoms with symptoms." Now, rotating credit associations are regarded by businessmen as a social nicety. Often, one person serves as a member of more than a dozen associations, and in order to obtain reciprocal obligations, they also imitate the practice and become a head of an association once.</p>

<p>Because "rabies" injures and kills people, the authorities have issued a "killing stray dogs" order to eliminate future troubles. All the captured dogs are killed with gas, dying of poisoning. Thus, big and small dogs alike have had "dog luck" from now on!</p>
<p>Because pork prices are high and the supply is not smooth, dog meat is already being sold in the suburbs. Two thousand yuan buys a pound, which is cheaper than pork anyway.</p>
<p>This is called "I want your life, I want your 'dog's life', and 'cooking its meat and eating it' to gratify the palate and do one's best to take revenge!"</p>
<p>Horses that harm the herd are certainly not to be tolerated, and dogs that harm the herd are also not to be tolerated; people who harm the herd are even more intolerable!</p>
<p>Today, I really want to eat the "fat" and "oily" meat of some people to vent that pent-up resentment.</p>
