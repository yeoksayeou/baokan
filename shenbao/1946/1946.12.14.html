<h3>純的北平　不歡迎政客　徐悲鴻反對遷都</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕民社黨代表楊浚明對記者談稱：政府提出之憲草，係有其政治上之來源的，而非空談理想之主義，第二組審查會是討論國大章，國大乃一非經常之機構，事實上無法監督政府，國大權力過擴大，幷產生立法及監察委員，財五權制亦不能保，此點需要考慮，不可辜負蔣主席及憲法起軍人之古心。</p>
<h3>變更匯率建議及決議　由各國政府決定　國際貨幣會定下週開會</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕此間人士相信，國際貨幣基金會於下星期接受各會員國貨幣之匯率時，即使有若干國之貨幣，其黑市匯率還較其官定匯率爲高，如法國法郎對美金之黑市匯率爲三二五對一，而官定匯率則爲一一九對一，又如捷克克朗對美元之黑市匯率爲一四〇對一，而官定匯率則爲五十對一，但均將以各該國之現行官定匯率爲據。國際貨幣基金會之若干董事，雖主張採取適合實際之匯率，以便支特較久，但具有大多數表決權之董事，包括美國在內，則認目前環境猶欠穩固，不宜據即確定此項實際的匯率，再如國際基金會向若千貨幣提出疑問，將對該貨幣及其政府有所不利，英國政府力主不宜在目前對現有匯率從事仟何可以避免的改變。自瑞典於七月間變更其匯率後，使英國政府此項主張益顯其有理，但基金會之接受各國貨幣現有匯率，亦僅爲一種形式，良以基金會之開始外匯交易，至早亦當在明年三月一日也。而若千國家尤其是法國，在彼時以前，諒必已調整其貨幣或充實其經濟，聞基金會董事有赴若千國首都訪問之意，俾促各該政府或將貨幣貶値，或使經濟狀况充實，俾使匯率與經濟實况相稱。基金會本身至多祗能對任何貨幣給與有限而暫時性之支持，不能調整其基太上的不平衡，故關於變更匯率之建議及決議，乃係各國政府之事，常非基金會職責所在也。</p>
<h3>第七審查委會　舉行全體會議　熱烈討論基本國策章</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕憲草第七審委會十三日晨舉行全體會，出席代表一七七人，賴璉主席，第一國防外交小組召集人冷欣報告審查通過之五項條文，並聲明擬不設專章。第二國民經濟小組召集人報告，已審查決定之五項條文，並報告午後該小組當繼續開會完成工作。第三敎育文化小組召集人家驊，報告審查通過之十項條文，並聲明已決定擬另設專章。第四社會安全小組召集人谷正綱，報告審查通過之六項條文，並聲明已決定擬另設專章。旋各代表就應吾將「基本國策」分設數專章一事熱烈發言，經決議送請綜合合審委會討論，至十二時散會，十四日晨續開全體會</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕第七審委會十三日上午舉行審查會，下午國民經濟組開會，上午由賴　主席，由各小組報告審查結果，冷欣報告國防外交組決議，國防不設專章，　本國策分章與否，交綜合審委會。劉振東報告國民經濟組，朱家驊報告敎育文化組決議，另設敎育專章。谷正綱報告社會安全組決議，擬請設專章，並由邵力子萃本國策全章報告起草經過極詳。下午由小組會劉振東王席，通過臨時提案兩件，（一）冷少泉等提運用科學，興水利，改善農業，促成農業工業化案，（二）程孝剛等提，凡以勞心或動力之勞力能力參加企業者，均承認其勞力得與出資本之股東同享權利，其資本計算方式及後屬條例以法律定之。</p>
<h3>婦女在選舉中　比例爲百分廿</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國大第一審委會十二日雖通過建都北平，但南京而民仍心有未甘，十三日發動挽回之運動，同時因昨日審委會巾李代表荷所提出應遷都北平之理由有「南京爲在精衛之首都，爲國恥之首都」等語，予南京市民以極大刺激，十三日晨南京市參議會第一次大會舉行開幕式，即席　時動議組成「南京市民代表擁護都南京請願團」，由全體市　議員組成，前往國大請願，要求兩項：（一）陳述不必遷都北平及奠都南京之理由。（二）請　處李荷，由正副議長陳裕光，陳耀東率領，於十時抵達國大會堂，主席團孫科，秘長洪蘭友即就第二休息室接見，陳裕光，陳耀東，改復初等相繼發言，情緒激烈，對李４何措辭不當，尤表憤慨，至十二時始陸續散去。談話經過如下：陳裕光稱：政府還都不久，人心未安，今復聞國大會對遷都事有所爭執，全體參議員認爲不妥，故前來請顧。陳耀東稱：十二月千三日爲最沉痛之一日，民廿六年之今日，南京市同胞會遭到最慘酷之大屠殺，被害同胞達卅萬人，我們今日來此請願，具有最重要之意義，國家欲求安定，對遷都一事，即不應存任何成見，而應顧及事實。國父實業計劃中謂：南京有高山，有深水，有平原，爲一最理想的都會，故如說遷都即是違反國父遺教，不僅國民黨應該遵守，即是各黨各派亦應遵守，各國遷都，其理由不外兩點：（一）爲革命維新，如北伐維新與土耳其革命均會遷都，一爲戰爭所迫，如法蘭西巴黎遷都，蘇聯之退出莫斯科，都爲戰爭而遷都，除此而外，則史無前例，假如眞有一天實行遷都，則無異白白犧牲了我京市卅萬同胞，措詞至爲沉痛。繼有某參議員說明今日請願之兩事，一爲請維持憲草第七條，即不必遷都，二爲徵處李荷。當由孫科致詞稱：中華民國有史以來，奠都即在南京（全體鼓掌），辛亥革命時，國父即奠都南京，後以袁世凱關係，始被迫移至北平，自廣州北伐革侖完成，復奠都南京，九年前因戰爭影響遷至重慶，今勝利到來，已還都南京，故就「定都」言，無疑問的爲南京，　國大　討論者，爲遷都而非定都，民初被迫遷都北平及抗戰遷渝，均係萬不得已之事，難道國民大會發生萬不得已之事，而必需遷都乎？本人不能代表國民大會答復將來是否遷都，但本人要以代表政府告訴諸位「定都南京」。旋改復初等稱：「李代表在會塲中所稱，南京爲汪精衛之首都，此不僅侮辱南京市民，而且辱及我全國人民，謹向大會要求，李代表應向全體同胞致歉」。「不僅侮辱我南京市民，且侮辱了我國父，因南京定爲首都，爲國父之主張，而不是在精衛所定，我們要槍斃他」。「我們要到中山陵哭靈去」。「我們要罷免李代表」。「我們要把李代表放在中山陵去槍斃」，孫科首先退席，洪氏亦被包圍，羣情極爲激昂，最後再提出有力之呼聲，「請轉達主席團要求李代表道歉，如不能達到目的，將再發動百萬市民向主席團請願」。「我們要求公審李荷」。休息室中舌劍唇槍，一齊幷發，近十二時一塲激辯始告結束。</p>

<p>〔中央社成都十三日電〕川省府工礦考察團，頃就考察各地所得資料研究結果，發表川省工礦事業之一般困難，不外下列數項：（一）缺乏資金週轉，利息太高，期限迫切，而國家銀行，貸款手續繁雜，中小型工礦，無法圖存，以致增加成本，金融枯竭，生產萎縮，而一般中型工礦，則咸感於器材工具等設備不足，雖具有天然優勢條件，亦不易生存發展，尤以動力爲最難解決之問題。（二）一般工礦，十九尚在守舊式法手工業階段，缺乏專門技術，及工商管理人材，浪費人力財力物力。（三）一般工礦，均困於材料及產品之運輸，資金呆滯，成本大增。（四）外貨充斥，農村經濟破產，人民購買力薄弱。（五）產銷不調範，供應不相應，同業公會組織欠佳，政府提倡保護督導久力。（六）未切實從培植推廣改良，檢驗原料品種及注重維獲農村副業着手，以致原料日益缺乏，雜劣，形成工礦業枯萎。</p>

<h3>論法律違背憲法的解釋及宣告</h3>
<p>— 羅必達</p>
<p>巾華民國憲法草案於上月廿八日由國民政府主席蔣親自提交國民大會審議以來，各方情緒熱烈，對茲國家根本大法，討論不脈求詳；諸凡國民大會及國都問題，且均予以修正變更，貴在令人感到欣慰。現在憲草審議工作旣將結束，而其中一個重要問題，却被忽視，這就是法律違背憲法的解釋及宣告問題。</p>
<p>憲草第一百四十七條規定：「法律與憲法抵觸者無效，法律與憲法有無担觸發生疑義時，由司法院解釋之。」此利規定筆者認爲尙有商確的餘地，法律與憲法抵觸者無效是當然的，不然憲法便無保障，憲法便不能成爲國家的根本法，成爲一切法的母法了。法律與憲法抵觸，就是法律違憲，但法律違憲有二種，一是法律形式上的違憲，一是法律實質上的違憲。形式上的達憲，是指法律的制定及其所規定的條文很明顯地與憲法抵觸，而實質上的違憲，是法律的本身雖不明顯地違背憲法，但施行的結果，却與憲法規定的精神相抵觸。形式上的遠憲是明顯的絕對的，而實質上的違憲　　　的相對的。所謂法律的違憲，自然應該包括形式的與實質的兩方面，而實質的違憲更應該　　，其是否達憲必須很審愼的決定。考之各國實例，除捷克一九二〇年憲法分別形式的與實質的違憲外，其餘各國都不用明文區別違憲爲形式的抑爲實質的。因爲形式的違憲是絕對的，判決比較容易，所以捷克一九二〇年憲法規定由普通法院審查。而實質的違憲因爲是相對的，爲鄭重起見，所以規定由特設的憲法法院審查。一般認爲三權憲法的政制下，國會專司制定法律，總統公布法律，而法院專司適用法律。法律茍依法制定，依法公布，則法院應該適用，以爲如果賦予法院以審查法律違憲之權，則法院將有侵權之疑嫌。所以奧國不論聯邦法律或各邦法律，是否有抵觸聯邦憲法，也不由普通法院審查，而由特設的憲法法院（Verfassunggerichtshef）審查。承認普通法院有審查法律是否違　權的，以美國爲最顯著，面行使此權的爲聯邦最高法院。美國聯邦最高法院共有法官九人，每次開庭有六人出席，即足法定人數，一切判決只要出席法官的多數意見一致，即可成立，因此八九人出席只要五人意見一致，就可判決，六七人出席只要四人意見一致，就可判決，此四五人的意見就可推翻國會中數百人制定的怏律，似乎有點不近理，何况法官也是人，旣是人，則其政治思想，經濟思想，倫理思想，以及社會思想導等，絕不能公平無私，而每受環境的支配，有所偏頗，所以法律由法官去判決有吾違憲，常然不免根據法官自已的見解，擇其不利於自己環境的宣告爲違憲。因爲判決權在法官有此弊病，所以德國　馬憲法，不令法院有審查聯邦法律違憲之權，若有違憲應由代表各邦的參政院，總統或公民提出，而由公民投票決定。這辦法當然很民主的。美國羅斯福（Franklin　D．Roosevelt）總統第一任期內，已由國會通過了工業復興法（National　Industrial　RecoveryAct）農業整理法（Agricultural　Adjustment　Act），便因聯邦最高法院的宣布爲違憲，使他所欲施行的一切新政，均告失敗，因新政的失敗，使人民生活的改善蒙受了影響，因此近來美國有一種運動，謀改進此畝缺點，其計劃有三種，第一種是法院宣告法律違憲，應將法院的判決，提交公民投票表決，公民若反對法院的判決，法律應有效，第二稱是法院宣告法律違憲，應將該項法律提交國會覆議，國會如仍維持原案，法律可有效，第三權是法院審查法律有吾這憲，應以全體法官三分之二的意見爲標準，而不應祇以過半數的意見爲標準，九名法官至少要六名認爲違憲，法律才無效。第一種計劃，法律是否違憲，決定權在公民，第二種計劃，決定權在國會，第三種計劃，決定權在絕對大多數的法官。決定權在公民，理論馱最好，但事實上行使最困難，尤其是以中國地方之大，人口之多，行使上的困難必更大，決定權在國會行使上比較方便，但國會如果制定違憲的法律，尤其是制定擴張國會權力方面的法律，國會不自認爲違憲，便毫無辦法，結果必然造成國會的專制，而憲法便無法保障了。所以決定權還是仍在法院比較妥當，不過法官行使此權，必須十分愼重，爲增加其愼重的程度，憲草第一百四十七條，最好作以下的修改：「法律與憲法抵觸者無效。法律與憲法有無抵觸由司法院解釋之。司法院判決與憲法抵觸之法律，應提講總統明令廢止之，總統對該項法律如爲形式上之違憲應即明令廢止。如爲實質上之還得提交司法院重密，重審結果如有全體法官三分二維持原判決時、總統對該頃法律應予明令廢止。」</p>
<p>這樣修改，至少有三大優點：</p>
<p>第一形成行政與司法間的制衡關係，因爲法院可以判決法律違憲，總統可以要求重審，而重審須有全體法官三分之二維持原判決，法律才須明令廢止。如果法院判決法律違憲，不管怎樣便生效，則法官認爲不利於己者，即宣告其違憲，法院便不免侵權，司法機關便不免有專制之嫌了。現在經法院判決達憲的法律，總統可以提交重審，而重審須有全體法官三分之二維持原判決，法律才無效，這樣即形成行政與司法間的制衡關係，而制衡關係是一部憲法的良好象徵。</p>
<p>第二得避免法院的錯誤判決，法官是人，凡人總免不掉有錯誤，法官的審查縱然公正謹愼，但仍難免有錯，因此普通案件每有初審·再審·三審·甚至經過了三審，有時還允許有複審的機會　而對於法律違憲與否的重大事件，竟不許重審，於理似有未合，現在照修改後得有重審的　會，自然理論與事實雙方面都是很適合的。</p>
<p>第三得容納民意而伸縮判決，法律達憲有時不是憲法條文的抵觸，而是憲法精神的違背，但所謂憲法精利是抽象的，所以法律的達憲是含混的相對的，因此甲認爲還惡，而乙認爲不違憲，因爲是否違憲可作正負解釋，故全體法官不能有完全一致的主張，因無完全一致的主張，故最好的判決應該是根據民意的判決，但法律未被判決爲違憲前，人民是不注意其是否違憲的，因人民不注意，所以法官無法知道民意，現在照修改後有重審的機會，重審時人民必然已注意，尤其是對人民有切身關係的法律，必然立刻　　切地注意，因其注意而研究，因研究而滬得正確的結果。法院有重審的機會，一方面研究可透澈，他方面民意可淸楚，這標所下的判決，自然可以非常恰當，總統對此項判決的必須執行，也是應該的了。因爲這樣的判決，不但正確而且重視民意。爲了有這三大優點，用實鄙見，就正賢達。</p>

<h3>稚老蒞錫記　爲故友析產掃吳芝瑛墓　暢談古今逐句解釋大同篇</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫訊〕中委吳稚暉，本邑人，勝利後僕僕京滬，業逾半載，迄未抽暇過返桑倖，最近以其故友廉南湖先生水獺橋畔舊居，牽涉其介弟廉隅（偽駐滿大使）逆案，爲敵產處理局駐蘇辦事處全部查封，南湖先生前與廉隅未經析產，所遺財產自屬兄弟共有，惟廉隅身任偽政府要職，觸犯國紀，所有財產，依法應予查封，但因此牽及他人利益，被牽涉人，自得申請保障，吳氏與南湖先生友誼敦篤，現廉家境況極淸寒，乃撥冗於十二日午後三時由滬返錫，因爲事先守秘密，故到站迎候者，僅有陳子寬·孫振球兩位。稚老下車後，即逕赴公園飯店休息，嗣即邀集廉氏親屬公議，爲南湖廉隅及其後嗣析產，預定俟立據後再向主管官署聲請，除應析歸廉隅部份予以沒收外，其餘　應發還執業。十三日晨，並偕廉氏在錫親屬，抽暇往掃南湖夫人吳芝瑛女士之墓，芝瑛夫人與先烈鑑湖女俠秋瑾女士爲至交，女俠在紹興就義後，芝瑛夫人爲收拾骸骨，移葬於西湖，義聲天下，而其瘦金體之書法，尤馳名遐邇，夙爲稚老所欽仰，戰前芝瑛夫人因病逝世，遺蛻葬於惠麓嚴家棚，此次稚老來錫，篤年舊友，故一爲瞻謁。稚老身衣藍花緞羔皮袍，禿頭不冠，皓髪童顏，在新生路陳宅端坐眾賓之間，意興甚豪，莊言妙論，縱談古今上下，間以諧　，歷兩小時絕無倦容，據稚老談及國共之爭，喻爲「鬼哄天」「鬼推磨」，並言托洛斯基嘗言：「世界有一亂事即獲一進步，」托氏雖爲史太林所排斥，而斯言未始不爲共當所服　。勝利以前，中樞規劃建設，尤注意於鐵路，不意勝利後，變亂繼作不特計劃中之鐵路，未由建築，原有之路方在拆毀，遂致交通寸斷，貨運不暢，民生日困，繼謂世界之組成，有四個要素，一曰道德，二曰經濟，三曰政治，四曰慾望，自有人類依賴，罔不傾向道德，執任何人而問之，汝對此世界希望若何，莫不望此世界成爲一至好之世界，可見傾向道德，實爲人類之本性，但人類尤離不開經濟，故不能無爭端，節制其爭端，乃有政治，而人又各有慾望，因慾望之發展，變亂遂無已時，欲期永無變亂，斯維大同。舊時余向極反對孔子，但今則漸覺欽佩孔子，蓋孔子對宇宙之發展，確具獨特之見解，在二千餘年前，即認定政治祇能於短時期內適用，發展之終點，將爲不需政治，無政府之大同時代，禮運大同篇對大同時代之氣度，進於大同之方法，大同時代之特況，均有扼要而意義深長之描繪，吳氏言至此，當將大同篇逐段逐句，詳爲解釋，新義迭出，聞者咸爲開悟。繼謂大同時期之現實，至早需在二萬年以後，二萬年驟聽似爲一長期，但自「北京人」到現在，已約五十萬年，而人類有史時期，依歐美人自埃及立國迄今計算，約爲八千年，中國自堯舜禹湯至今則爲六千年，若如顧頡剛之否認舜禹，則中國之有史時期僅四千餘年，以四千年比五十萬年無異瞬息，故若以宇宙之進展視二萬年亦僅劍頭之一哄中而已。吳氏又對美貨湧入謂事極自然，在中國則出些教師錢，無可逃避云云。稚老定十三晚返滬。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十二日電〕希臘總理蔡爾達里斯今日在安理會與南斯拉夫保加利亞及阿巴尼亞之代表並席而座，正式提議安理會應組織四强調查團前往希臘，調查該國北境之糾紛　形。蔡氏力陳希臘在反抗軸心國戰爭中所作之努力，並謂該國已決定訴諸聯合國，因此舉似藉束希臘北部不靖局勢之唯一辦法。渠認爲希臘已成爲「不宣而戰」之犧牲者，此種戰爭之　的乃在分割希臘馬其頓省之領土，並圖在希臘樹立違反民意之政權。希臘北部目下之局勢對於國際和平與安全實係一種危險。南斯拉夫代表卡薩諾維契答稱，希臘之態度實屬幼稚，該國欲將國內因極權政權而發生之矛盾衝突，假怨於其北方和平之鄰邦。蔡爾達里斯謂希臘北部遊　隊曾在巴爾幹鄰邦受過訓練云云，絕非事實。希臘代表團所提照片證件，亦不準確。要之，火軍之留駐希臘，對於該國之不靖大有關係，南斯拉夫代表團將正式反對在南希邊境進行調　。</p>
<p>〔聯合國成功湖十二日電〕南斯拉夫代表卡薩諾維契今日要求安理會立派代表團調查希臘對南斯拉夫·保加利亞·及阿爾巴尼亞鼓勵希臘內戰之指責。此一驚人提議，緊接希臘總理蔡爾達理斯演說之後提出。按安理會以前討論烏克蘭對希臘之控訴時，美國提出派遣調查團之議，但被蘇聯用否決權打銷，而與蘇聯亦步亦趨的南斯拉夫竟舊事重提，自出意外。卡氏稱，蔡爾達里斯之指責並無任何根據。希臘目前前戰爭，非外國勢力所掀起，僅由於希臘所採內政政策及其窒息大衆之努力使然。安理會應及早派遣代表團，調齊希臘內幕情形，此種局勢甚至將更形嚴重，因英國支持蔡爾達理斯仍在希臘保有駐軍，自應負其責任。外國軍隊之駐紥希臘妨磯希臘人表示其眞正意志云。</p>

<h3>英下院辯論印度問題　邱吉爾指責政府　謂印度內戰殆不可免前途暗澹　尼赫魯將晤甘地商談</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕前首相邱吉爾今日在下院發表演說，預料印度將發生內戰，並謂印度市民暴動已有數千人喪失生命，應由工黨政府負責。商務部長克里浦斯則稱、惟有印度完全遵守英國方案，使互相對立之政治及宗敎信仰，於統一政府內融合爲一，始能防止內戰慘禍。邱氏並謂克利浦斯對於印度獨立之努力，已發生絕大不幸。繼乃歷述內戰之可怕，其結論爲無論是好是壞，此責任應由政府負之。邱氏認爲印度之統一係表面的，全由英國將領統治所致。政府以組織印度臨時政府之權，委諸尼赫魯領導之國大黨，爲印度敎徒所支配，實已鑄成大錯，如令印度敎徒恃其人數之多，以統治全國，勢非引起內戰不可，而在內戰獲有結果之前，將使印度人口大爲減少，令人不寒而慄。克里浦斯繼即起而答覆邱氏稱；政府欲將統治權利交印度政府，而使之不發生內爭，誠覺無從措手，其最大之困難，則爲印度敎徒與回敎徒尙未表示準備互相信任。印度各派分立，實爲一茲本繼給，回敎徒欲使中央政府權力分散，以求大部份實現其分治之夢，即另建一回敎國，而國大黨則欲建立一强固之中央政時。惟本人不願下院發生一種印象，認爲局勢業一已絕望。回盟領袖眞納於參加上週會議後仍留倫敦，今日在旁聰席中以手支頣而坐，靜聽辯論。隔座即爲出席聯合國大會印度首席代表尼赫魯之妹班狄特夫人，中縣布幛，以隔開此政治宗敎信仰不同之兩代表。</p>

<h3>吳局長召集各界　商談年終獎勵金　重新決定四原則　規定一月爲標準但保持有彈性　並望普遍成立工廠會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局於昨日下午五時，邀請市商會，總工會，中國工業協會等代表舉行談話會，就年賞問題交換意見。出席者計有社會局局長吳開先，處長趙班斧，及徐寄賤，水祥雲，壽景偉，胡伯翔，田和卿，葛傑臣，章祝三，梁永章，方如升，吳熾先，葉翔　，王先靑，桂甫星等。市黨部主任委員方治亦於六時許趕到出席。吳開先局長祖任主席，致薛稱：過去數月中無工潮發生，爲工商業能勉强維持之原因。年當問題如不能及早解決，將爲工潮之種子。本人在一個月之前，即在市政府會議提出此種觀點，吳市長深爲同意，並令擬具辦法，以便轉呈中央。上决市政府之聯席會議中，經各方詳加研討後，已決定處理年賞問題之原則如下：（一）以各廠商今年之營業情形，作爲年賞之標準。易言之，不以各業爲單位，而以各個工廠各家商號爲對象。（二）凡廠商有盈餘者，依去年之例，發給年賞一月，但規定工人股務期間滿一年者，始能得一個月之年賞，其未滿一年者，按比例計算，但最少不得低於十二分之一月，（三）廠商無盈餘者，年賞比照一月之標準核减，按照其負担能力，由勞資兩方直接商定。不能協議時由社會局公斷，必要時可請會計師協助。（四）有若干廠家虧損甚大，主人本無意經營，全爲遵守政府命令而勉强維持者，不給年賞。將來如有盈餘，再從豐補發。</p>
<p>吳局長報吿畢，請出席代表儘量發表意見，使年賞辦法益趨完善，而執行有效。</p>
<h3>總工會希望廠家成立勞資座談會</h3>
<p>總工會理事長水祥雲首先起立發言，認爲市府聯席會議之決定原則，甚爲公正，工會願加以擁護。目前醞釀之工潮甚多。希望廠家能成立一勞資座談會，溝通勞資兩方意見，消弭工潮於無形。工人亦具良知，決不致以年賞逼倒工廠，亦盼資方對工人勿加欺騙。雙方伺舟共濟”度此難關。最近國貨公司曾借款二億元，以醫藥費之名義發給職工，職工領受之下，莫不大爲感動，竟自動取消星期日下午之休假，爲公司服務，近日營業收入大有提高</p>
<h3>工協胡舊翔指出　盈餘意義應確定</h3>
<p>中國工業協會代表胡伯翔繼之發言，指出年賞依盈虧情形而定，對於盈餘之解釋，應有明確之規定，今日工廠中。往往有賬面賺錢，而存貨减少，事實上爲虧損者。此種情形是否可認爲有盈餘？而工廠今年因虧損不發年賞，允許有盈餘時從豐發給，等於訂定條約，似非良策。關於後一點，吳局長當時予以解釋謂：此爲一種君子協定，並非訂立條件之謂。胡氏最後表示：對原則擁護，但實行時應愼重。</p>
<h3>臨時工年賞問題　趙處長提出解釋</h3>
<p>工協代表田和卿補充胡氏之意見，主張盈餘一節，可由同業公會開會個別審查各廠商，以決定盈虧，並自定年賞發給辦法，呈報社會局，同時通知工會。此法較之由社會局請會計師查帳爲妥。因查帳有技術上之困難，拖延日久，年賞將失去時間性。又年賞之給付日期，田氏認爲籌款費時，希望勞方能加以寬容。又臨時工是否應有年賞，亦請提出討論。趙班斧處長當時立卽表示：按工廠法規定，工人服務三個月者即爲長工。但本人確知有一部份絲廠，其僱用工人之契的兩月一訂，使工人永爲臨時工人，顯然資方意在取巧，剝奪工人應享之權利，故對於臨時工人之年賞問題，應有公平之處理。</p>
<h3>商會提出雙俸制　工資一月爲標準</h3>
<p>至是，商會會長徐寄　稱：本人從事商界多年，平素對於川人，主張「待遇好，效率高」之原則。故對此問題，不主張用年賞之名，而贊成採用雙俸之辦法。廠商如有盈餘及不虧損者，均多發工資一月；眞正虧損者不發年賞，工人當可諒解。依此原則辦理，可避免會計師查帳之煩，而年賞問題可於短期內解決。同時盼望工會方面，對此亦多作努力。</p>
<h3>工會代表提畢議　剛性規定不合理</h3>
<p>徐氏語畢，總工會棉紡業某代表，即對年賞一月爲限之原則，提出强烈之異議。渠稱：棉紡業之特別賺錢，爲有目共覩之事，故年賞辦法主張按成例辦理，如必欲以一月爲限時，其餘之利瀾應歸之國家，方爲合理。且棉紡工人在敵僞時期，每人管理五十木管，今日每人管理二百木管，工作加重已三倍，如獎金不提高而反减少，生產數量將難於維持。至是另一工會代表又加補充，謂有若干廠商方面，工人平日工資甚低，全靠年底紅利，目前一個月爲限之剛性規定，將爲渠等利用以剝削工人。關於件工不發年賞，亦不合理，例如香烟廠之女工即均爲件工。</p>
<h3>勞資可直接商談　俾易於獲得協議</h3>
<p>此時棉紡業烟業之總工會代表，分別詳述過去兩業年賞之優厚，棉紡業之代表且估計：如年賞以一月爲限時，按百分之廿分配者少拿四十日工資之紅利，百分之廿五者少拿兩月之紅利，百分之卅者少拿二個半月之紅利。此種大利，盡歸資方享受，實心有所不甘。至是總工會代表數人，均贊成對年賞不作剛性之規定，廠商盈餘豐厚者應多發，否則將使工人情緒不佳，生產必然跌落。最好能由勞資各推代表，開誠布公，直接商談，當易於獲得協議。件工亦應酌給年賞，因套鞋業香烟業之女工，均爲計件制，效能甚高，此種工作制度，不能因年賞問題而加以推翻。常然，所謂「件工」者，乃指在廠內工作之件工而言，在廠外工作者不在此例。</p>
<h3>利潤豐厚之工業　應該多提公積金</h3>
<p>此時壽景偉氏以中立者之立塲，提供意見謂：本人主張年賞之名，應改爲「年終獎金」，使寓有獎于勵勤勞之意。利潤豐厚之工業，例如今日之棉紡業，應多提公積金，以增强事業之基礎。我國之勞資兩方，需增加接觸之機會，以請通意見，消除誤會。壽氏對治本之道，强調政府對於財政經濟政策，必須有所革新，以挽救工商業之危機。</p>
<h3>方希孔發表意見　提出年賞六辦法</h3>
<p>各代表普遍發表意見後，主席乃邀方希孔主委致辭，方氏對年賞問題，逐項提出辦法：（一）年賞以一月爲限。（二）由各業公會與工會先行洽商，如有爭執時，再提請政府機關公斷。（三）少數獲利頗豐之廠商，其年賞亦可先由　資兩方代表先行談判，如有困難，再由政府將年賞數提高，以求其平。（四）希望各業在一週內即依上法辦妥，決勿拖延，以免事變。（五）年賞應改獎金，以寓勞資平等之意。（六）工人中有特殊成績者，最好能加給獎金，專事搗亂者，减其獎金。</p>
<h3>吳局長歸納意見　決定獎金有彈性</h3>
<p>會議至此，已逾七時，吳局長歸納各代表意見作下列各項決定：（一）「年賞」改名爲「年終獎勵金」。（二）獎勵金以工資一月爲標準，但需有彈性。（三）獎金一經決定，資方應迅速發放，以免幣値跌落。（四）件工及臨時工之獎金，依各廠商去年之成例辦理（臨時工服務足三月者以長工論）。年終獎金如有爭議，必須依法定程序辦理，任何一方不得採取自由行動，否則嚴繩以法。</p>
<p>吳局長至此强調「工廠會議」之利益及重要，希望廠方能普遍成立此種會議，並發揮其眞正之效力。水祥雲指出工廠會議制之徒成具文，主因爲資方購買美金囤積居奇之行爲太多，不敢將帳目公開。某代表則謂勞資兩方認識之不足，實有以致之。吳氏强調稱：工廠會議爲勞資間之橋樑，廠方可以之選拔人才，培植幹部；而此會議又無權干涉行政，不必怕開。對於蘇聯之「勞動英雄」模範工人之制度，吳氏亦認爲値得中國工業界取法。</p>

<h3>中央般空公司　籌癖中美空綫　計劃先與美航空公司合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國各航空公司於中美航空協定正式簽字後，即將開始飛航中國，但中國各航空公司，則因目前訂購巨型機，不易到達，致一時尚不能遠航。中央航空公司前曾向美國訂購C—54機四架，但因目前美機廠工人時有罷工情事發生，故該批飛機最早至明年年底始可來華。在自營飛機未到前，該公司計劃與美西北航空公司合作，但須由交通部批示後始可實行。如經核准，中美航綫自美國至馬尼刺問綫由西北航空公司負責，由馬尼刺至上海間則由中央航空公司承辦。</p>

<h3>翻印教科書案　地院改期再審</h3>

<h3>新新公司職員實行「懶工」</h3>
<p>頻新公司騙工因要求年賞問題，於十二日下午四時許開始「罷工」，　工方面因生活程度日趨高昂，收入不數維持，故提供已有二十一年歷史之每下半年補工（一月工錢）要求依例發給，資方則表示營業呆滯，虧負累累。因此勞資雙方互相堅持，昨日仍在「懶工」狀能中。四周壁上及櫃台旁貼滿「今爲　從政府功令，旣不罷工，更不怠工」，「請顧客勞駕轉向他家購買物品」等等，之標語。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關係方面表示：此次新新公司之工潮，職工提出要求後，强負責人於極短時期答覆，當負責人吿以條件須經董事會通過時，復要求其保證董事會必能通過勞方條件，顯不合理。且未經社會局許可，實行變相之罷工，不論其要求是否合理，於法定程序即屬不合，聞工人代表且在社會局時之表示，有此事渠等可自行解決，不需局方調處，有以自由行動威脅資方之意。社會局現己下令，着即恢復常態，然後再行談判。據總工會某負實人吿記者：新新公司勞資關係素尚不惡，過去公司經濟困難時，勞方曾接受薪水七折支付之辦法；薪水發不出時，公司曾以禮券代替。「補工」已有廿一年之歷史，目前資方忽予取消，故致引起工潮云。</p>

<h3>吳市長答記者問　高價政策未有所聞　貸款原係促進工廠生產　乘機鼓動市塲殊屬不當</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金美鈔華股市况在各項謠諑繼續之激盪下，續向新高峯挺進，有謂當局將考慮高物價政策，有謂國際貨幣　金會議下週一公布各會員國間之貨幣匯兌率，預測我國對外匯率或將更動。記者旋訪吳市長，探詢當局是否考慮高物價政策。吳市長稱：未有所聞。且云：當局辦理生產貸款，係爲融通生產事業資金，俾便繼續增產，在決定之時，亦曾預料市塲或有刺激，今果不出所料，貸款尚未放出，投機者竟鼓動市塲，興風作浪，殊屬不當云。</p>
<p>又據某觀察家談稱：國際貨幣基金會議，雖定下週一公布各會員國問之貨幣匯兌率，惟宋院長前已聲明：凡直接受戰事影響之各國，可延緩公布其對外之匯率。故預料該項消息，對我國或不致盡如一般所觀察，且修正進出品貿易辦法施行伊始，似無再將匯率調整之必要云。</p>

<p>又關於中法易貨事，中信局亦曾數接法國商人來電，購買茶葉，終以價格未能洽妥，致中信局經辦之茶葉，未有出口，至於茶商之零星自動運銷亦時有所聞，然皆爲數極少，僅爲試探之性質</p>
<p>又據另一方面消息，茶商因茶葉出口無望，要求政府以合理價格予以收購，政府方面，因茶葉之銷路呆滯，亦不願因收購茶葉而擱置一部份資金，使遭凍結，唯補救辦法，尚在商討中，年內恐難有具體之辦法。</p>

<h3>香港銀錢業　畸形發展</h3>
<p>香港工商業一蹶不振，惟此間新開銀行月有增加，各銀行以邇來新開設銀行日多，爲業務競爭起見，對於存款利息竟高至四厘，匯兌方面，亦力求敏捷，且將匯　減低至五厘，等於放款利息，問有若干銀行因營業不振，遂將資金改營投機事業，誠冒極大危險云。</p>
<h3>美國商人希望　國貨運美銷售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據美國美茜公司（世界最巨型之百貨公司）遠東經理哈凡氏談稱：戰後美人對「中國製」標幟之關切，實爲前此所未有。渠甚望我國國產能趁茲時期，以合理價格，大量裝運赴美銷售，否則其他遠東國家，將取而代之。例如：目前印度南美等地，已有類似中國式樣之貨物運美銷售。渠盼中國之生產商及出口商，應有遠大之目光，設法抑低利潤，俾便激剌貿易。如在此靑黃不接之時期中，扳貨不售，反足釀成危險之後果，而使中國國產之購買者與消費者，轉向他國產品云。</p>

<p>中國進出口貿易協會，前爲便利同業出口物資資金週轉計，經呈請經濟部轉商四聯總處，經四聯總處轉請中央銀行擬定出口物資貸款轉質押，曁轉押匯辦法，加以核准，轉知各行局辦理在案，惟該項辦法，該會始於昨十一日接奉經濟部代電通知，業已分函谷同業知照，據該會發言人稱：復員以來，交通未全恢復，內地運輸，頗感困難，近據各同業報稱，新近由重慶運滬貨物，需時達兩月之久，政府行局雖盡力鼓勵出口，充分供應資金，但原辦法中第三點期限方面規定「原質押最長不得超過九十天，凡滬收押匯，重慶不得超過三十天，宜昌·天津·靑島·沙市，不得超過廿五天，其他各地不得超過廿天，」等限制，此則又使出口業感受束縛，未能充分發揮，現該會除向交通常局要求調撥船隻，迅速加運，並勉勵同業，仰體政府意旨，積極增加出口外，擬再要求國家行局，酌予放寬期限，俾獎勵出口，以收實効。</p>

<p>「龍門的發電量可以　一百廿萬個　羅，這點的工作要中央來做。而環繞着它周圍的灌漑水利由地方來辦。」但想得到的多而能够做的少。陜省的水利還是　溉爲中心。渠水綠上黃土岸，家家門前有垂楊。然而水利局要做的不知還有幾許。水利工程要多日標，但現在只有一目標：灌漑。已經完工放水的八偶渠，永利局派出四百多憫管理人員，按畝收取水費，棉田三等，征棉一斤·十兩·四兩，以三百六十元一斤折一折付；麥田三等，征麥五斤十二兩，三斤十二兩，一斤十四兩，以四十八元一斤折價；稻田征米三斤十二兩，陝南新增水田征七斤，以四十元一斤折算。卅四年度水費折算辦法在今春商訂，棉麥價猛漲，秋間收到兩億又九千萬，不够管理費，水利局今年虧本，賠了四億。「明年可不能這樣幹了」。水利局長劉鍾瑞對我說：「平均收三千五百元一畝不過兩斤多棉花，不算多，明年可以收四十億。可以用來做別的事啊」</p>
<p>四百個人不够負起全部的管理工作，渠上有水老，斗長，渠保，名謂協助行水人員。每一渠設管理局，劃分若干段，一段一個斗老，轄若干個斗門，一個斗門一個斗長，轄若干個村堡，每個村或堡有一個渠保。都是當地農戶推選，無給職，只發一點津貼，以頃爲單位，每頃不滿百元。斗長比水老渠保多拿一倍，因爲他比較負責多。水費等級以斗門爲單位，水利局方面吿訴我的辦法是這樣：每年十一月一日起至次年十月卅日止，爲灌漑年度，年度終結，各渠管理局請水利局，並轉函財廳雙方派員，到渠上查核全年度受水情形，看收或，查詢全體水老，於是訂水費，水老認爲公允，分別簽名蓋章。至於灌漑較　或未及灌漑的，一槪轄免。規定開征日期後，由各地縣府依照征收糧賦版串辦法，造串發給由地主自封投櫃，和糧賦一起繳　。</p>
<p>現在的涇惠，渭惠，梅惠，黑惠，漢惠，泔惠，褒惠，潼惠八個渠，灌漑了一百卅萬畝地，涇，渭兩渠完成於抗戰前，梅黑等五渠完成於抗戰中，潼惠渠則係地方自籌經費，在勝利後開工今年五月落成。其間灌溉面積大小不同，泔惠渠最小，不過三千畝。與灌地七十餘萬畝的涇惠渠差二十餘倍。</p>
<p>現在正在施工的五個渠，完成後可以灌溉百萬歡地。灃惠渠在　縣秦渡鎭，灌地廿三萬畝，卅年九月開工，引水工程已全部修好，渠道和建築物完成大半，正修土渠；湑惠渠在城固昇仙村，溉地十六萬畝，也在卅年九月開工，還有十分之一二的工程做不了。澇惠渠在　縣，灌地十萬畝，卅二年開工，完成了攔河壩和隧洞，正修建築物。定惠渠在橫山趙石窟，引無定河水灌地四萬畝，卅年四月開工，設備早已竣事，建築物中只差倒虹吸管和涵，還拖着一個工程尾巴，最近這一帶要緊打仗，工程人員統統逃到榆林。洛惠渠是中間最大的一個，從登城引洛水灌大荔朝邑蒲城三縣地五十萬畝。還是李儀祉在世時辦起的涇洛工程局將工程從民國廿二年一直辦到現在，大部工程已經完竣，可是輸水工程極困難，渠道須穿鐵鑛山而過第五號三千公尺長的隧洞，經流沙層，要巨款，要工具。最近消息傳來，第五號隧洞竟在上月廿四日擊通，十餘年工程，眞是好不容易！</p>
<p>工程做不了。拖着一個工　巴，說起來是爲錢，實際上多　是受了官僚主義的影響，制度有問題。從事這些工程的書凱子誰不滿腹牢騷。造預算清款，行政院批，農民銀行借三年的利息現扣，因爲是農貸，手續費時，總是論季論年，然而總是不足成數，同預算差上百分之幾十，結果拖着一個工程尾巴，於是再造預算請款，把口啣雪茄，坐在辦公室裏的先生們嚇一跳，因爲竟比第一次請的全部工程款項還要多。陝省水利局所辦的，澇湑定四渠都如此：卅五年度還要工款。發給時如再打折扣，於是明年再請，尾巴上再拖小尾巴。去年農行貸了款，今年還沒訂上合同。水利局說：不借也好咱們另想辦法。預定是今年都完工，到年底看吧。</p>
<p>國際銀行如果借款給了中國的銀行，這些銀行拿來抬高了利息放出去，從中　錢，實在是大成問題。除非有特別默契，國際銀行也不願幹。砲火趕走了定惠渠的工程師，物價壓死了學者，整個國際銀行買不回來的。</p>
<p>陝省水利局還是　儀祉帶來的一批人，至今無更動，大都是李的學生，陝省在水利工程上有些成績，並不偶然。</p>
<p>三原薄暮　古城渠靜</p>
<p>那天薄暮，仍套姓帖的　車，離涇陽農塲到三原。茫茫衣霧逐漸籠上田隴，如一束素練繞於白楊腰間。到三原天剛落黑，車主好意，直送我進東關。公路上則有胡宗南長官的牌示，大書：嚴禁鐵輪大車行駛公路。因爲公路剛剛修好，把車轍塡平了。這些鐵輪大車，用牛或驢拖挽着，着實厲害，水泥路也壓得爛。我的車在鄕道上彎彎曲曲的走了十五里，才到達三原城。</p>
<p>三原宛如京滬綫上的蘇州，在西安做事的頗多在此住家。五萬人口的小城十分恬靜。街道上也是整整齊齊的聳天白楊。大小店舖，于右任題的招牌處處是全國商店，于右任題的招牌，其百分比恐以三原爲第一。因爲三原是于右任的故鄕，而于右任體的招牌字也成了風氣，甚至弄得使人認都認不得，次日去看看這位老先生的故居，幾楹舊屋，仍是舊時景色。隔壁却有一個很漂亮的民治小學，是他所辦，每次回家，不居舊屋而住在這小學裏。這條街名爲西關渠道邊。裝棉花的大車正絡繹而來。</p>
<p>三原城有一種富足氣，到處聽見軋棉和紡織機聲，都是家庭手工。男女學童的面目都很淸秀，這也許是三原對西安有蘇州作用的緣故。中學有八個之多，但是「量够質不够」三原是素稱盛於文風的地方，北去耀縣是稱爲陝北的門戶，「往北去可就苦了。」在三原開始聽到這種話，縣政府門前樹着許多明淸石碑，說明淸代的流放制度，刻着八復渠的放水規章，這渠道現在還在。而三原縣城街道惟一特點是渠，用磚修砌，的有三公尺寬，正在街心，用以引幾個蒂水池的水，現在水涸，有小孩子在裏面玩。這渠修得精緻，每隔十幾步就有小橋，卅二年駐軍協助地方修成，西北人對給他們水的人都是感激的。</p>
<p>縣參議會正在開會，因爲縣預算不數問題不得解決，正休會三天。縣預算幾乎是每年不敷的，不敷的款沒有出處，這類重大問題，往往是正式會議中不能解決的問題。結論大抵是「地方自籌」，非攤即派，現在禁止攤派了，參議會如出來硬抗，問題就解決不了。</p>
<p>勝利以後，三原棉農頗吃了一點苦頭，政府突然放棄統制政策，統制政策在抗戰中實多詬病病，突然放棄，宣佈將以「市價」收購，但沒有開辦的日期，花紗管制局毫無準備，官員碌碌，各奔前程；金融市塲突變，商店大多關門，道種可以預料的勝利蕭條，正落在棉花登塲的時候，棉價自十五六萬元跌到一萬五六千元，慘跌十借！桶農嗟嘆，　担進城，無人過問。而卅四年的三原農貸一萬五千萬要在十一月底還。當時貸款一萬五千元等於十斤棉花，這時則需要一担。這情形關中各地都如此，弄到棉農怨天恨地，把棉籽統統打油。而三原是棉市中心，三原人至今心悸。今日三原收購棉花的大小的行莊林立，但棉價低，仍是十五六萬元，被駡爲「托辣斯」。這數目同勝利前比已澈底變了質，紗價如何高？相形之下，棉價低如何低？工業品與農產品價格的剪刀差如何大？這是今日中國農民的直接痛苦。</p>
<p>而勝利以後，敵機絕跡，徵兵停止，部隊待遇提高，各戰區駐陝軍隊分別前進接收，軍運驟少。最後一次的臨參會大聲疾呼說：「不需要的機構趕快裁掉，减輕人民負担。防空監視隊，防空監視哨，國民兵團，各鄉鎭隊附各保隊附所屬官兵，以及軍事征軍委員會，草料站和所屬駐富平耀管理運輸人員，都應該裁撤了。否則夏收成災。勝利蕭條，預算不敷，如何得了。】這些事確是做到了。可是曾幾何時，不過一年，我一入三原，就碰到來領新兵的部隊人員，滿頭大汗，向我問路。我說：「我也不知道呀！先生。」</p>
<p>我薄暮到三原，薄暮離三原。我對這恬靜的關中古城，除了幾件不愉快的事外，都懷有好感。</p>

<h3>三原人的監察氣　一張勝利清單·一篇冷硬數字　說出多少甜酸苦辣！</h3>
<p>陝西省的老同盟會員都是硬派，而且富於幽默感。三原人彷彿也都如此，面色正經，彷彿都有監察氣。</p>
<p>抗戰結束，三原人開出了一張勝利賬單，表示說：我們供獻於抗戰的，你看有多少。也是說：抗戰是怎麼會勝利的。也是說：你看三原人付出的勝利代價大不大？也是說：你看我們有多少痛苦。那賬單上寫道：</p>
<p>我們農民的負擔：自徵兵以來，壯丁實在徵發數共計一萬三千一百六十二名（國民兵團統計）；自田賦徵實以來，共納小麥確己徵起實數二十六萬七千九百八十一石五斗二升七合（田糧處統計）；賦棉四千零五十六担又五十三斤（花紗布局統計）；又自二十九年代購軍糧起，計：共輸小麥一十萬零二千六百八十四包，包穀三千六百八十一包（縣政府統計）。三十二三兩年度共獻售棉花七萬三千零六十五祖六十九斤（花紗布管制局收購統計，三十一年度未查出）。三十四年度一至八月各種長短途運輸及兌購軍糧賠價等共計二千五百四十九萬四千五百五十九元。又支應各軍草料除領得少數價款外，共計賠價五千零七十六萬四千六百三十九元（以上軍徽分會統計歷年未經千者尚不在內）。又三十四年一至八月各鄕鎭額外派款平均全縣共的五千八百四十八萬九千六百二十四元（各鄉鎭公所統計歷年均不在內）。以上除壯丁不能以錢計算，代購軍糧賠累未列，棉花統制不計差價外，只徵實小麥姑按每市石一千元平均爲二六七·七五二·五二二元，賦棉按每担一十二萬元平均爲四〇五三〇〇〇元，連前各項合計即有八萬萬零八百三十八萬三千三百四十九元。以不及十萬人口之小縣（九九〇八八人，縣政府統計），依據一部份不完備之調查（人口數，商在內，負擔數，商不在內），對國家出力出錢，有如此數量，亦可謂勉盡國民之責任矣。</p>
<p>我們商工兩界的負擔：查本縣商工人民，八年來對國家正式負擔納稅義務外，所有代購軍麥，國防工事，公債儲蓄，獻金獻機，車騾賠價，慰勞傷兵，義務警察，各種民工，及靑年從軍，地方預算不敷等等額外攤派，節次增高，商工兩界額外款項二十六年爲五千六百元，二十七年六萬元，二十八年十五萬六千元，二十九年二十九萬元，三十年一百九十五萬五千元，三十一年二百八十三萬元，三十二年八百零八萬元，三十三年六百九十八萬六千元，三十四年截至八月底止一千零零八萬零五百四十元，前後共計三千零四十四萬三千一百四十元。正式稅款，除統稅，海關稅未經調查，又三十一年之前，所得稅利得稅及三十三年以前之營業稅印花稅數字不明外，計三十二年所利兩稅九百萬元，三十三年營業稅五百萬元，印花稅五百萬元，所利兩稅一千七百七十三萬三千元，三十四年營業稅一千萬元，印花稅一千萬元，以上合計共五千六百七十三萬三千元（商會統計）。以五百三十餘家門市營業，無百萬資本以上之行號（商會會員統計與登記），而有如此負擔，其數不可謂不巨。工界在戰前本縣並無廠號，勝利前二三年，因供求關係，始漸有織造土布之營業，未幾即爲花紗布管制局統制，改織軍布，僅發工資，領紗換布，不能私營。計最初登記者有木機四百三十五台，以次賠累歇業者一百五十一台，現存者祇餘二百八十四台，連年交過軍布，在軍需局有二十七萬一千餘元（三原紡織業促進分會統計）；在花紗布局則一十三萬八千七百五十六疋（花紗布管制局統計）。是對抗戰軍需之貢獻，亦不可謂不力矣。</p>
<p>我以爲很容易做這一件工作，抗戰後方的人民都像三原人一樣，提出一張賬單來，就可以算出抗戰後方的人民直供獻於抗戰者究有多少。各省市的國大代表們如何？你們的皮包裹有這類的數字沒有？</p>
<h3>庚子賠款出附加　陜人痛述田賦史</h3>
<p>陝西人還記到慈禧逃難，庚子賠款的年代。三原人鬧着，說我們至今還負担着庚子賠款，陝西全省人民也鬧着，說陝西人至今負担着庚子賠款，這不免令人詫異，說來便等於數說混亂的陝西田賦史。田賦全書不過說了一個序言。我作關中北道行，看到田賦負祖重於他省的特點。以每元計，須納賦糧小麥一斗四升（中央地方各百分之五十）；軍糧一斗四升（交中央）；公糧四升二（省與地方各百分之五十），一共是每元征三斗二升二。抗戰中每元征五斗。三原縣今年不敷預算公糧一萬六千三百九十石，就是參議會正在討論的難題。　陝西昔稱所謂地丁銀，地是田賦，丁是改征兵爲募兵，由田賦附加納稅，於是統稱地丁。河南安陽的攤派通知上寫着，某某先生丁洋若干，就是根據他有多少地來攤算的，淸代的陳跡，不圖仍見令日。而這地丁銀成爲正銀，陝西諺語說：一正一荒，意即一兩正銀之外，附加的荒銀也要多到一兩。這荒銀陝省各縣不等，有的七錢，有的九錢，其中三錢，則就是庚子賠款。此外便是昔日的陋規，「升官發財」的中國　語的產生根據。其中名目包括耗羨（碎銀鎔錠折耗），大平餘，小平餘，院房司書，飯費，解費，新平，紙費，硃費，地方留支差徭等等。民國元年，陝西軍政府整理田賦了，把正荒一併提省，地方半文無着，負担未見减輕，因爲地方另籌，款項反見增重。由此開始，所以陝四人說：我們至今負担着庚子賠款，田　一兩遂成爲一兩七至一兩九。重於他省。</p>
<p>廿一年度兩改元，　平一兩新合國幣一元五角，陝西省九十二縣在「平均負担，總額不减」的原則下一律以一兩八錢折算，變爲二元七角，仍舊完全提歸省庫，因地方需款，遂發明「田賦附加」，每年進步，到廿九年政府才有了命令：附加不得超過百分之百。於是一律征足百分之百，二元七角變爲五元四角，即是一兩正銀的一元五角外，附加了三元九角。</p>
<p>廿六年開始抗戰，財部指定正附（指荒銀）統劃國庫，實施國庫制，地方按月向國庫支領。陝西人一直大駡財政　長周介春荒謬，他竟把五元四角一律報部，把地方附加的二元七角也包括在內，並訂了一個辦法，在這二元七角中限撥百分之五十五作地方開支，在全開各省中別開生面。</p>
<p>可是這百分之五十五一落　庫　不能按時發，地方要錢用，續延不得，於是只得再來附加，但不使再稱附加，從此發明了攤派。欲研究陜西攤派史或有考據癖者，這便是原始材料。</p>
<p>卅年後田賦疋附一律征實，陝西仍以五元四角計，每元征五斗小麥。地方支出則在附加項下提撥百分之十五實物，作爲舉辦地方事業極費，即是從二元七角中提撥四角零五厘。而陝西辦法又是特別，不提實物，而是折價折發，結果如何，卅二年小麥每石一千人，折價只發一百廿，卅年每石二千四，折發二百元；卅四年漲到一萬七千一石，折價則是六百元。所謂提撥四角〇五厘，實際上四分都不到。可是每年地方預算不敷，動輒幾千萬至萬萬，駐軍支應浩案，於是擬派發展出新階段來，重複而又重複，一敗擊地！</p>
<p>今年政府以减輕人民負担，减免了附加的百分之五十，即自二元七角减去一元三角五分，但總數仍爲四元〇五分。如根據額外附加不超過百分之百的原則，那麽正附二兩，歸元不過三元，今年减免百分之五十，則常爲二元五角，無論如何，還要減免一元〇五分也吧，二元四角五也吧，陝西人是還要鬧的。他們巳鬧了卅五年。</p>
<p>然而，陝西人　默地說了：「這减免的一元三角五分，算是撤消了庚子賠款吧，而且庚款不過九角，實在已强得多了。」</p>
<p>我在薄暮中離開三原，驅車七十里至耀縣，深夜叩關，進入陝北的門戶。聞西安正降雪，耀縣高出西安一百數十公尺，無怪寒氣如此逼人。</p>
<p>南通一角　（上）街頭的一所大廈　（下）記者所寓之旅館　（本報記者凌松壽攝）</p>
<h3>從東臺到南通</h3>
<p>— 十日南通訊　本報泰縣記者凌松壽</p>
<p>東台收復後，記者又到南通去了一趟，事先，本沒有這樣一個計劃，在啓程的前晚，副官處李課長對記者說笑：「到南通去吧？」記者心裏想，橫緊在東台閒着沒有事，到南通行。在沒有這件事情之前，好像到東臺不到東臺是無所謂的一件事；可是一有了這個決定之後，左思右想，便想起好多事情要去辦理。</p>
<p>次晨九時啓行，坐的一輕大型運輸車，這車是送空軍聯絡流動組回南通的，所以除一車子的人外，還有許多機件。因此車子上顯得特別的擠。　到了南通市區，觸到眼簾的是街道整潔，房屋高大，市面繁榮……一切的一切，充滿了生氣；尤其是在收復區看够了刧後的凄凉，到這兒來耳目爲之一新，使記者內心中感到無限的快慰。學校的小學生放學了，在敎師的領導之下；排着隊走出校門，活潑而天眞，看到這一羣小天使們，記者心中想：「中國畢竟是有希望的！」</p>
<p>整整六小時的　動和風沙·委實受不了。可是爲事件太多，而車子明晨又必需開回東台防决</p>
<p>記者顧不得身體的疲倦，</p>
<p>旅館之後，便到街上去看看。</p>
<p>南通在蘇北，和揚州泰縣一樣；雖經過八年的滄桑，但並未受到兵　的破壞。公共汽車，吉普軍，私人汽車在馬路上飛着，三層樓五層樓的大廈在矗立着，紅紅綠綠的霓虹燈在照耀着……種種的事實，證明了南通雖在大刦之後，還是富庶的，繁榮的。「小上海」的別號，是够當得起。</p>
<p>不過，在另一方面看起來，南通依然沒有脫離了軍事時期的狀態。晚上十一時就戒嚴；並且，假如你注意的話，在寬闊的馬路旁邊，有時還可以找到一個碉堡。</p>
<p>各處跑了一下，順便買點東西，天已傍晚了。本來預定謁見李司令官默庵的計劃，便不得不移到第二天去。在飯館中胡亂吃了　一頓晚飯，到旅館中倒頭便睡。</p>
<p>因爲聽說車子開得很早，記者第二天淸早就起身。一脚跑到本報南通分館中，負責的人還在家裏沒有來。等了一會兒，記者和他們商洽了一些發行的計劃，隨即到綏靖區司令部去，時間太早了，司令官還沒有上辦公廳。記者便偷個空兒到點心店吃了一些點心。再到司令部去，當由司令官在辦公廳接見。</p>
<h3>司令官戎馬書生　展望蘇北全面澄清局勢</h3>
<p>在報紙上知道司令官是一位戎馬書生，見面之後，更證明了滬話的眞確性。不太高大的身材，帶着微笑的面孔，和一種輕鬆的語聲，襯托出這一位綜理蘇北軍政的人物的雍容和安祥。</p>
<p>司令官知道記者是由東台來的，他殷殷地垂詢收復區的情况，他深切地關注收復區民衆的痛苦，一再指示記者應對民間疾苦和共軍的暴行多多報導，使一般人們能够認淸蘇北的民衆是如何地處在一種水深火熱的環境之中。</p>
<p>接着，記者便詢問司令官關於蘇北局勢的將來。司令官的意見是這樣。他以爲：在軍事上，蘇北局面的全面澄淸，己經是一件不能再拖延的事。今後施政的重要方針，厥在如何能够在大劫之後使民生趨於安定，幷積極改正人民心理上的錯誤。今後的一切，胥視地方行政當局的工作效率如何而決定。</p>
<p>此刻已是八時多，車子要開回東台，副官處李課長特趕到司令部來催記者上車。時間已不容許記者再耽延了，記者乃要求司令官准許攝一張照，司令官應允，幷和記者一道下樓找一個好的背景。</p>
<h3>李默厂將軍在綏靖　區司令部花園內</h3>
<p>（本報記者凌松壽攝）</p>
<p>司令部屋子的前身，大槪是一座天主敎堂，三面環水，環境相當的好。屋後有一座花園，我們便擇定了此地做背景，攝了一張照。</p>
<p>記者要走了，司令官給記者題了幾個字：</p>
<p>「人生以服務爲日的。」</p>
<p>與司令官握別，記者便問司令官是不是預備到東台視察視察。</p>
<p>「當然哪！一等機塲修好，或許三兩天內我就要去。」司令官回答。</p>
<p>記者笑着說：「我在東台恭候着司令官的蒞臨。」</p>
<p>司令官含着微笑，點點頭。</p>
<p>記者離開了綏靖司令部。也記者離開了南通。</p>

<h3>介紹摶抱石其人與其畫</h3>
<p>— 趟清閣</p>
<p>一個美術家的人格高，他的畫格亦必高！爲了它們有聯帶的關係，可以相因爲果，故凡美術家欲其作品登峯造極，則首先須修養其學問道德。不然，任你的技巧如何熟練，你所畫出來的東西，只是紙上的色彩與綫條構成的平庸的景圖，而不是有分量有生命的藝術品。</p>
<p>傳抱石先生可算得一位人格高，畫格亦高的近代中國美術家，我是先見其畫，後識其人；先愛其畫，後敬其人的。正因爲我見其畫而愛其晝；從其畫的風格裏嗅到了相近的氣息，始願識其人，敬其人！也唯其如此，我們遂成了好朋友。不過，讀者可別誤會，我並非爲了和抱石是「好朋友」才來捧他，我是爲了尊重藝術的靈魂而介紹他的。</p>
<p>抱石留學日本習畫多年，現任中央大學藝備系敎授。他有一個祟高的藝術靈魂，他把畫當作他的第二生命，他珍視他的第二生命，所以他寫畫時一筆不苟，如果他爲了生活，或者是爲了換取畫材料而迫不得已舉行畫展，那他最得意的作品必不標價，也就是絕不甘把他的心血結晶拿去作商品。他覺得若那樣便是銅臭侮辱了他的靈魂，也是侮辱了藝術—反之，他如果送畫給朋友——懂得他的畫的朋友，那他必以他最得意的作品送朋友。他賣畫的時候很少，然而他肩上擔着一家五六口的重負，他的日子可算艱苦得够瞧的了，但他的精神修養使他操守了崇高的藝術靈魂！他在大後方重慶金剛坡的窮鄉僻壞度着他藝術至上的淸寒生涯，除了烟酒他沒有嗜好，烟酒就是他的雲感，也是他的强心劑。無烟酒他寫不出畫，所以，他寫一筆畫，總吸一口烟，喝一杯酒，等到他醺醺然醉了，作品也完成了。他是這樣一位洒拓，亮節的畫家，他對於名利是那麽淡泊，對於藝術却那麽認真！</p>
<p>抱石不僅是一位畫家，也是一位藝術理論家，他在藝術理論方面創作甚豐，爲了他的理論基礎宏厚精深，也帮助了他畫的成功。他的畫的格調古老有唐宋之風，意境超然，情趣飄逸，氣魄雄偉，用筆堅靱而不生硬，着色簡潤而不枯燥；取材淸雅，佈局元韵，比如這裏刊出的一幅「東山逸致」，便可見其智　之才！爲什麽他的晝會有這些優點，我們可以從他的畫裏面看出他學問道德的修養，他讀了不少的死書與活書，所以他能把人生的眞諦，孕育在他的晝幅中，在他的筆墨間隱隱流露着無限哲理的啓示，這啓示使你覺得人生應當享受在一種昇華的境界裏！自然，能够欣賞和接受他這種畫的造詣的人並不多，但他却絕不因此而改變作風，趨炎仳俗，附會低調的要求。</p>
<p>不過我又感到抱石的　的生命似稍嫌脆弱了些，也就是他的藝術觀似稍嫌消極了些，如果說這是他的缺點的話，（有好些愛護他的朋友曾經這樣向我批評過他。）那是非常容易彌補的，只須在取材方面加以注意即可。比如爲了配合今日之時代思潮，儘可以運用他所搜長的山水人物之卓越技術，多取材歷史的偉蹟，像屈原的忠貞，陶淵明的高潔，都足以表現民族的正氣。而能增高他的畫的分量。我導種淺見，不知抱石以爲然乎？</p>
<p>有人主張國畫須改良，甚而是中西合　。我是非常反對　　不倫不類的藝術。我覺得中國　有他傳統的價値，我們應有保留國粹藝術的信仰—西畫就是西畫，自有牠獨立的藝術價値，無必要把牠和國畫合什麽　。事實上，以國畫的技術寫西盡，或以西畫的技術寫國畫，均不能調和·所以我主張各守崗位，各工其專長·而各有千秋！抱石使是忠於國畫的畫家，他具獨恃創造的精　，雖有古風，並不落一般臨　之　！這也許因爲他多讀書，深研　　的原故。希望他將永遠　持　種嚴　的藝術態度。</p>
<p>抱石不久在滬舉行畫展，　於海上人士睹其作品之先，特　略介紹如上，門外談畫，難免貽笑大方，不勝惶恐之至！</p>

<p>生性淡泊，不慕榮利，每日執筆構思外，未　旁及一事。在里恒作大　油畫，廣吿圖案，建築設計，婦女衣飾，含意深蓄，落筆不茍，關畫室於西樓，　山在望，陳設靜古，入其室幾忘爲今世紀人。風景取材武林集古，躬往古都，舊邸　適，著作大成。蘆溝橋事變返滬，八一三戰　發，預知抗戰期長，倉惶出烽火，轉輾入內地，里中淪陷，舊居被佔，一切蕩盡無遺，深惜者藏書不下萬卷，先人手澤，及　琴二十餘年心力所瘁，一紙未留，流寓湘　黔蜀諸省，深八苗夷之區，在中央研究院及中央博物館瀏覽今古，集思廣益，得以中西藝術文化溶於一爐。勝利後　眷東返。滬無居，將離去。傅怒安先生與弟莫逆，見畫力主展覽，躬親整理，高義可感。</p>
<h3>點睛</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>老畫師張聿光先生，藝壇馳譽，垂四十年，與革命先進鈕永建經亨頤諸先生有　孚誼，張先生寶亦可稱之謂藝術界之革命者。其筆法，熔中西于一爐，故顏其額曰「冶歐廬」，前月曾作後方歸來之畫展於滬上寗波同鄕會，將其西南游蹤所搜得的畫件，張　作展，其雲霧邱壑山永　鳥諸幅，定購一空，藝術之飛價，是有目共　的，筆者昔年在明星影片公司，曾與有十餘年共事之雅，一昨遇我於漕河涇「冠農」，別來十年，先生鬃髮俱白，而情神奕奕，望之彌健，遂飯於園中。會園主冠生光生，調攝精神，長住此間，請張光生糾正佈置，囚「冠農」於復晨聲中重事整理，且己開放，作滬西郊區的點綴，頗得市區中小學校的涉足留連。冼君每於公餘，嘗從事園中建設，雖一草一木，親加移植，而謙謙之風，允足景仰，於聿光先生所指出的幾點，悉從其更變。筆者覺「冠農」之得張光生糾正，得風雅，淡泊之趣，足供一般騷人墨客之游涉，則謂之張聿光之點睛，非無謂焉。</p>
<h3>訪萬佛樓</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>在中國　畫史上，人物畫的發達，尚在劉漢時代，如蔡伯喈的小列女圖，毛延壽的仕女畫，都具着進展的跡象，直至明帝時，佛敎輸入中國，佛敎文化，和中國文化交流，在藝術上開闢了新局面，畫家的筆端也就幻現金身實相，所謂「三藐三菩提，一一佛一如來」，用丹靑表演出來，這種收獲，的確是很豐偉的。</p>
<p>就近今繪佛的名手而言，有白龍山人王一亭，有萬佛樓主錢化佛，一亭己在數年前逝世了，碩果僅存的，便是錢化佛。他在抗戰八年中，不嗅時餌，努力他自已本位的工作，甚至斷炊，他寗可收緊褲帶，耐着熬着，不低頭，不屈膝，所以有人稱他爲錢羅漢，眞可當之無愧。他跼居淡水路關帝廟後面的一個弄內，湫隘局促，客至幾無回旋餘地，更有在陋巷人不堪其憂的槪况，他却毫不在意。最近他却喬遷了，住址在進賢路鳳德里一號，筆者就去一訪新居，乘便和他談談。</p>
<p>新居寬暢的多了，並且在樓上，高爽軒豁，宜於工作，是日登樓，他正在繪一幅面壁岡，靑綠設色，十成八九，見了筆者，便停筆招呼，抬頭一望，眞是滿壁琳瑯，有孫總理·吳稚暉·于右任的題額，又有梁子眞所書—福無量壽而康之居」，這種善頌善禱的標識，的確可以使人興奮，尤其在煩惱苦悶中，對之足以消　一切。</p>
<p>他的偉大作品夏禹治水圖，預備作國際贈品給美國杜魯門總統的，現在居然成功了。這圖用四尺，宣紙二十六張，成一大卷，計長十有餘丈，其中人物，有冠冕堂皇的，有脆形怪狀的有妖嬈的女子，有雄糾的甲士，以及牛鬼蛇神，奔流互浸，什麼都有，他囑筆者在上面撰一引言式的小文，預備請吳稚暉一書，筆者就潦潦草草的寫了幾句：「禹之治水，爲千古偉蹟，而孟子載之，所謂掘地而注之海，驅蛇能而放之　者是也。化佛居士能應物象形隨類賦采，成此巨構，生氣動力，神韻趣味，悉莘於丈幅之問；合張僧　顧虎頭於一手，造詣之精，舉世無其匹。茲者洪水橫流，黎庶不能安居，比諸千百年前有過之無不及，而卒有力挽狂瀾，奠定　礎者，則歌頌讚美當不在神禹下。化佛居士作此，其亦斯意也夫」！好得他請　老寫，拙文就請　老斧削一下，也不必自己修飾了。據他說，這畫的動機，尚在抗戰時期，重慶消息，張　　繪百鴿圖贈給美國，直至勝利消息傳來，興奮之餘，便調丹　墨，繪這夏禹治水圖，規定每天工作數小時，近今始得全部完工。費了一年多的光陰，有此相當成績，偶出展閱，不覺沾沾自喜哩！</p>
<p>他壁上懸着一隻古琴，最有趣的，他名錢化佛，鏡架中嵌着幾個銅圓，標着「佛化錢」三個字，據說河南開封相國寺，係唐代所建，內有銅羅漢五百尊，身高二尺六寸，民國十二年奉直戰爭，基　將軍督師河南，把銅羅漢改鑄銅圓，分爲二百的，一百的，五十的，二十的，十枚的五種。鏡架中的銅圓，即銅羅漢的改鑄品，他的朋友特地送給他的。於是錢化佛，佛化錢，成爲捲　格。</p>
<p>他在民元光復前是參加地下工作的所以也可稱爲第一大膽，在敵僞時代，他居然冒着險，把日本軍政常局和僞組織的吿示，一張張的揭剝下來，經八年之久，成爲一全套，將來預備公開展覽。這種舉動，在當時若給敵僞發覺，說不定把他處死。他却往往利用深夜，尤其察風暴雨、人跡稀少，就擎着破傘，相機行事，幸而沒有遇到抄靶子，他偶一同憶，心中猶有餘悸哩。</p>
<p>他和筆者合撰的「拈花微笑」，「花雨繽紛」兩種筆記，各有數十篇，他一一的剪貼成册，居然厚厚的兩大本。他說，「這雪泥鴻爪式的頑意兒，可以印成單行本，再加許多銅版照相在上面，不是很有意思嗎？」</p>
<p>喝酒，是他唯一的消遣，他喝酒不　肴，任你什麽花生米，豆腐乾，靑菜蘿蔔，都可下箸。他說，喝酒當以酒爲主體，擇肴便失了喝酒的意義，今天心中愉快，喝杯酒，更足助興；今天心中鬱悶，喝杯酒，借此麻醉。所以若干年來不覺和　生結着不解綠。這時他即從實桌旁取出一瓶白玫瑰燒來，要和筆者對喝，筆者辭謝了，向他吿別。</p>
<h3>詩語</h3>
<p>— 田肅</p>
<p>詩應該是最美的東西，不論詩作品的本身是慷慨激昂的，抑或是哀感頑艷的，如果缺少了美的成分，就彷彿一個垂死的病人。</p>
<p>說詩是文藝形式的最高表現，也不以爲過，因爲詩可能像一把名首，有雖文那樣的鋒利；也可能像一幅圖畫，有散文那樣的淸麗；而又有時候，却會吿訴我們一個小說的故事。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血122</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>〔這來的兩個人，比我們更能體貼你哩」。菊子的聲音有些顫抖了，可並非妒忌，乃是一種親情的衝動。</p>
<p>「兩個人？」鶴見有些奇怪。</p>
<p>「是的」。　子答着，「一位是下午六點鐘來的。她是一位「甜孃」，只有畫上的美人才有那麼甜。打聽到你在休息，她立刻把話聲都放低了，生恐　動了你。她寫好了這張小簡，並再三關照我，必須等到最適合的時機再轉交給你。」菊子說着，便把小節遞了給鶴見。（「甜孃」兩個字，是菊子同鶴見幼年時的秘密語，代　美人。）</p>
<p>「大哥—因想到你必有許多話向我　詰，所以我踏着你的足跡，到這　來　訪。如其你不高興，或是不願看見我這討厭的人，我自然會悄悄地走開。以後，隨便什麽時候，只要到『俱樂部』去打一個電話，我必定像飛一般趕來，聽你差遣。指着我的命運睹咒，我決不會對你幹一件欺心的事。祝大哥健康……再者，我的電話，在『俱樂部』名單裏，共有四個，這裏不　。……又再者，我今晚住在濱海社，其電話和地點，令妹都知道……又又再者，　妹是一位可愛的人，我願意和她交結，只要她不會惡我——柳詩手上」。</p>
<p>鶴見看畢，忽然揚起頭來問着菊子，「菊妹，你喜歡這位『甜孃』嗎？」</p>
<p>「喜歡的！」菊子很天眞的笑着，「我願意得到她一張簽名的照片……」。</p>
<p>「哈……她是一朵多刺的玫瑰！……你要當心哩，……你剛才說兩個人，另外還有一個甚　人，可是一個小夥子，我的汽車司機？」</p>
<p>「很對」。菊子答應着，又瞧了她母親一眼。母女兩人對着一笑，表示鶴見猜得準確。「他是七點多鐘來的，他說十點多鐘再來一次」。</p>
<p>的英半個小時之後，那下弦的半輪冷月，漸漸從天際升了起來，一望無涯的海洋，一鄰一鄰地蕩漾出一片霞光，像幻想中開關了金色運花的八寶池。山麓上的松叢，好像罩上了一層深藍色的薄沙，沙灘也泛出了一片　銀光彩。就在這樣的景色下，鶴見和萍子，並肩在海濱邊際上，來回　躂着。</p>
<p>鶴—「那個第五縱隊的獨眼傢伙，用什麽方法，採集我們的行動和談話？」</p>
<p>萍—「那怪我太大意。我也會那一套，無論距離多遠，只要能看得見說話人的嘴唇動，就可知道說的什麽」。</p>
<p>鶴—「　啞這是訓練。以目代耳的方法要多少時學得會？」</p>
<p>萍—　兩三個月，我有這個抄本，恐一怕你只要兩三小時就能運用了」。</p>
<p>鶴—」可能借來看看？」</p>
<p>萍—「　時可以獻上」。</p>
<p>鶴—「東京究竟有多少第五縱隊？」</p>
<p>萍—「現在只有三四千人，可能越來越多。各種專門技能都有，滲入了我們各種最高秘密機構」。</p>
<h3>漫談女作家</h3>
<p>— 談宜</p>
<p>貧病交迫的白薇</p>
<p>最近有人問我，聽說白薇在重慶時窮得身上生了白蝨，住在人家屋簷下，確否？</p>
<p>文人之窮、已爲公認之事實，尤其是在戰時的大後方，尤其是一僩光明坦白堅守崗位的文人，不過，雖說窮，也不至窮得滿身白蝨，睡在階沿石上如沿門乞討的丐兒。乃白薇之窮，竟令人造出如此的謠言，而且流傳到上海，誠不免使人吃驚。不過，白薇在重慶，的確比一般文人更窮，不單窮，而且還時常生病。她在重慶沒有固定的住所，經常在賴家橋政治部附近鄉裏居住，偶然到重慶來，祇能提着一個小布包，到朋友地方去打游擊。她的朋友也都不是富有者，過的是「重慶屋簷下」生活。白薇去作客，自然祇能作屋簷客了。此也許便是謠言之所由來吧？至於身上的白蝨，我雖未曾親見，但想來總該不至於如此。雖然爲了窮，無力添置新衣，但她穿的十年前留學東京時代的西裝，還是非常整潔。尤其在夏天，雖然沒有傭婦替她洗燙，但她身上的衣服永遠是那麼平展，淸潔。以如此整潔的外表，該不至有白蝨的內容吧？</p>
<p>在軍委會政治部第三廳工作或掛名的文人，爲數甚多。如楊翰笙田漢馮乃超等都是。後來改組爲文化工作委員會，三　　長郭沬若轉任爲文工會的主任委員，原班人馬又都轉移了過去，政治部是軍事機關。文工會的工作人員雖然是「文人」，但也都掛上了武職。如郭主任委員爲中將，田老大爲少將，其餘上校中校乃至上中少尉一應俱全。然而白薇却因爲旣非武人，又是女性，將校爲國家名器，不能隨便給一個非軍人的女子，所以祇好有屈當了一名　員。</p>
<p>員當然不是官，這在志不在封侯的白薇，原是無足輕重的，然而此中却有一個實際問題。蓋是「官」才可以享受額定薪餉以外的官兵福利。雇員是額外人員，不在國家預算之列，她這一份福利也祗能眼看別人享受了。而最糟糕的是那時的福利，實在比正薪餉大得多，差不多全靠福利在生活，白薇旣得不到福利，自比別的武職的文人更苦了。</p>
<p>雖然苦，但她要和苦搏鬥，她要從苦中求生存。決不　義別人，嫉妬別人，更不向別人乞憐，向別人發牢騷。她有一雙手，除了能寫文章之外，她也可以做別的勞働者可以做的事情。於是她自己種菜，汲水，洗衣，做飯，甚至做家常最汚穢的工作。如此，她征服了苦，爭來了坐。但，她的寫作生活却就此犧牲了，因爲一天的時間祗有二十四小時呀！</p>
<p>散文與小說，雖爲時間所限制，使她沒有執筆的時間，詩卻比較不受限制。她可以在洗菜的時候沉思，在一面用蒲葵扇搧着爐子，一面低吟。在辦公之暇將他筆錄下來。所以她在抗戰期間惟一的出品，便是詩。</p>
<p>單是貧窮，她是不怕的。更可怕的是接着而來的病。而且病得很重。在重慶市民醫院住着，不僅住院費無着，藥錢也沒有。總算有幾側朋友帶忙，使她渡過了這重鬼門關。恰好這時有人發起援助貧病作家，跳舞呀，演戲呀，義　呀，募捐呀，弄了好幾百萬基金，可是當文協撥給她兩萬元救濟金時，她毅然拒絕了。拒絕的理由，她並未說明。但由此也可以看出她的骨氣，是一位決不見錢就要的硬漢。</p>
<p>也許是生活與人情逼害了她，她現在是更沉靜，更淡泊了。我們常看到她提着一個小布袋，獨自緩慢地走着，從來不坐軍子。她那配着一副金絲邊圓眼鏡的憔悴的臉上，永遠沒有一點表情。與人談話時，細微得使對方不敢暢快的喘一口氣。她從來沒有紅着　子高聲大喊什麽「和平」呀！「民主」呀！但她的言調是永遠那麽和平，她的能度是永遠表示着民之。</p>
<p>抗戰勢利了，多小人換了新環境，有了新工作，變了新態度。惟有她，依然如此。至多不過從重慶　　下之客，變成了上海　　下之客而已民。</p>

<h3>遊資</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>南京在鬧建都問題，南京，北平，總還有一陣科紛。</p>
<p>上海却吵年賞花紅，並且創造出新名詞——「懶工」來，一窩風中，黃金　破三百萬大關，美鈔達六千三，華股一致漲停板。眞熱鬧！</p>
<p>看樣子，今年這個年硬是要呌我們大家出挺，不會馬馬虎虎能混得過去了，怎麽辦呢？眞急死人！</p>
<p>不必講什麽深奧的經濟理論，根據常識就可以判斷，黃金美鈔齊飛，柴米油鹽全跳，物價看漲，是必然的結果。而上海的物價飛漲，又怎能不影響到全國其它各地。</p>
<p>有人說，這一陣旋風，是由於遊資出籠之故，請大家想想看，造成大量遊貧出籠的原因在什麼地方？</p>
<p>政府的金融政策不能再搖擺了，假使是緊縮通貨，緊縮信用的，就應該堅持下去。如果搖擺，會替投機家製造暴利的機會。死人身上剝衣服，這個社會是唯利是圖，他們有什麼做不出呀！</p>
<h3>看世道人心作誠實測驗</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>你的週圍的人們的誠實程度如何？這是一個難以解答的問題，也是一個應當設法解答的關係社會道德的水準的問題。一位名叫亞力山大。泰勒的加拿大人，却想出了一個妙法，來解答這個問題。　他在二十四個信封上寫了自己的住址，信封內封了一方摺疊的報紙。黏合的封口都用擦不掉的鉛筆劃個記號，假如封口被拆開而又重新再黏合，這些記號便能洩露這個舉動。</p>
<p>每個信封上貼好了郵票後，一泰勒便將它們平均散置在多倫多和漢米爾登兩市的街道上。每封信上都註着號碼，散體後，泰勒本人且隱在一旁，看過往的人們怎樣處置這些「遺失的」信件。</p>
<p>他的第一個實騐是在漢米爾登的街道上做的。那時是下午四點半鐘，街上很熙攘。</p>
<p>一個婦人停下來了，拾郿第一封信。他冷淡的看了看，便走入了一家百貨商店。幾分鐘後，第二封信被一位年靑的女子拾了起來，她看看地址，便將他扔入轉角的信箱內。</p>
<p>另一條街上，他看到一個男子檢起了第三封信。他念了念地址，便將信封摺起來放入了自己的口袋。這封信永遠沒有回到泰勒的手中。</p>
<p>另一封信，在同一的地點放置了很長的時間，有的人踩過它，有的人則繞道而行。一個健壯的少女走過來了，想踢它一脚，但是沒有踢着。她向前走了變步，又停了下來，回頭看看那封信，但是不能決定是否要走回來。突然間，她匆促地趕起路來了。</p>
<p>在火車站的人口處，一個男子拾起了一封信，劉他的朋友說：「這封信一定是要寄的，不知誰遺失了它！」他便走向信箱，將信放了進去。</p>
<p>結果，泰勒在漢米爾登市散置的十二封信，除了兩封之外，都被人拾了起來，寄回給他。</p>
<p>泰勒又在多倫多做同樣的實騐。巧得很，也是失踪了兩封，寄回了十封。</p>
<p>所有被人拾起而郵的信，都未曾被人拆開過。在漢米爾登市，十二封信被人拾起之前，曾有七十個人走過它。在多倫多則有八十個過客對它們置之不理。拾起散置在多倫多的信件者是十個男子和兩個女子，拾起散置在漢米爾登市的十二封信者，是男女各半。　這個小小的實騐證明了：假如誰在這兩個城市中遺失了信件，拾得人替他付郵的機會是百分之八十。</p>
<p>當然，這個實驗所得的結果不能代表廣泛的誠實的程度，但是祗少能窺知其一斑。</p>
<p>讀者們，假如你也想効法泰勒做這樣的一套實騐，我敢保險，你所得的結果一定要比泰勒所得的結果打上一大折扣，並不是我在此「自卑」。</p>
<h3>當心睡槽賊</h3>
<p>— 吳蜀江</p>
<p>睡槽賊這一個名詞，是筆者從上海土著人士口中聽來的。睡槽賊的活動時期，就在最近兩三月中，越是天寒，是越起勁。</p>
<p>但，睡槽賊行　的技倆，祗限於堂室深遠的大家庭。</p>
<p>當天甫發　，「倒　　」一　「倒」娘姨，大姐　　　，忪，開了後門，提出馬桶，就在這一剎那間，睡槽賊即閃身而入，藏身在偏僻塲所，日間僵臥，夜間活動，每値更深人靜，即四出梭巡，竊聽人話，打探實藏，待時機成熟，即滿載而出，眞有神不知，鬼不覺的巧妙。</p>
<p>睡槽賊隨身帶有乾糧，大小便並備有皮囊，據云；老於此道的，能藏身五七日不算難事，即决等的，亦能掩藏至二三日。</p>
<p>時屆寒冬，正若輩大施妙手空空的時候，筆者不　饒舌，提醒大家一下！</p>
<p>科學常識</p>
<h3>新皮裘</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>一陣寒流，女士們的皮大衣紛紛應市了。</p>
<p>也許妳沒有皮太衣，到皮貨店去看看，想採購一件。上千萬一製的，高不可　；對幾百萬元一襲的紫貂，和獺皮也感到「阮囊羞澀」，而便宜的羊皮和鼠皮，妳又覺得「看不上限」！</p>
<p>即使妳幸運的置有一襲高貴的紫貂或者獺皮大衣，同時却也有許多煩惱，怎樣保持它的光澤？怎樣避免雨雪的侵襲？就是怎樣保持它的潔凈也是一大難題。</p>
<p>這些煩惱和困難，都被一位勤勉的墨西哥的科學家，卡爾瓦博士（J．B．calva）所解決了。他發動了「製皮法革命」，用廉價供給亂眞的，但是實用的皮貨，並且提供了「皮貨保險」。</p>
<p>卡爾瓦四十八年前誕生於墨西哥伯布拉市，畢業於墨西哥大學。一九二八年他獲得美國本雪一凡尼亞大學化學工程師的學位，一次年，應該校之聘，做研究的工</p>
<p>那一年—一九二九的冬天是特別寒冷的，卡爾瓦便買了一件獺皮大衣禦寒。其實，這件獺皮大衣是贋品，穿了沒有幾天就現出羊皮的原形，卡爾瓦雖然上了當，但是却激發了他發動「製皮法革命」的決心。經過十五年本斷的研究後，卡爾瓦終於發明了「可塑法」，能在三十六小進之內，將一張生羊皮變成一張能一够抵禦爾雪侵蝕和耐穿，並且能一亂眞的高貴的毛皮。</p>
<p>卡爾瓦和他的六個助手配合成他們自己的化學品和設計他們自己的自動機器。羊皮經過一連串的化學的洗濯，乾燥，修剪，擦光和染色之後，羊毛　維的全長的三分之二就變成永久性的髮狀的一絲一絲，餘下未變的近皮部的羊毛，能够增加皮裘的溫暖</p>
<p>卡爾瓦成功之後，便將他的「可塑毛皮」遂呈「較佳織物試騐局」去試騐。該局的報吿是：「此種　維能忍受所加之變化，對於穿着有持久性。」「可塑毛皮的颜色，光泽，柔軟和質地都不受雨雪與乾洗的影響。它能够受踐踏和完全染汚，過後，祗須用一塊濕布揩抹一番就能煥然一新了。</p>
<p>這種「可塑毛皮」的另一特色，是能够染成各種特別的顏色。紅色，葡萄酒色，都已應市，每襲祗售一百七十元美金。</p>
<p>卡爾瓦說：用他的這種製皮方法，也可以將有些人「看不上眼」的中國鼠皮和澳大利小袋鼠皮，製成紫貂一般的皮裘。他又說：毛根不固的毛皮是難以改造的，所以選擇生皮時要小心，同時，製造的程序也要小心。應用卡爾瓦的「可塑法」也能够使直的毛變成永久性的捲曲。眞正的高貴的紫貂獺皮等類的皮裘經過這種「可塑法」的加工製造後，便能够更耐穿，更長久一的保持它們的光澤和抵禦雨雪的一侵蝕。一但願我國從事皮裘事業的人們，也能奮起直追，研究出更好的毛皮製造法，使皮裘成爲普遍化的耐用的禦寒品，而不僅是貴族化的裝飾品！甘</p>

<h3>松花江畔的楊綽庵</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>哈爾濱市長是中蘇人文交流的東北名城，自音已有「國際都市」之稱哈市　立在松花江畔，風景秀美宜人。</p>
<p>現任哈爾濱市長楊綽庵先生，是一位少年克苦，有志竟成的模範人物。楊先生今年六月閒，曾到上海，並且接見記者和答覆他們對於東北問題的詢問。楊氏正在中年，頭髮巳稀，豐滿的面頰，載上眼鏡，兩片薄薄的嘴唇，談話間處處表現出他的果敢與決斷的精神</p>
<p>他最反對我國官塲沿用的刻板公文。他說：「所謂公文程式，世界所無。」他更指斥公文上那些模稜兩可的用語，如「姑予照准」，「尚屬可行」，認爲這就是諉避責任。</p>
<p>楊氏膈建人，今年四十五歲，會在北平中噶學院畢業，戰時任職江西省政府委員兼建設廳長。</p>
<p>據說在民國十五年間，楊氏還祇是郵局裏的一名「揀信生」，每天的工作，是將成千成萬的信件，按照投運地械分類整理。當時，他還未十分熟習西文，所以揀擇寄往國外的郵件，頗費時間，於是他努力研讀，利用工作餘暇去補習英語。後來，偶値外籍郵務長用英語向他問話！他也能應答如流，由是得到上司的靑睬，被派往外國留學郵政。學成回國，更入黨從政，一帆風順，造成今日的地位。</p>
<p>目前的哈爾濱，已被中共所佔，令人　念這一位松花江畔的市長的行　何處？</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織15</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>「拔劍而起」之流</p>
<p>「包相打」本來是上海「　　人」的拿手好　。在靑紅帮興　時期，那些帮中的小嘍　們，最喜幹出種　路見不平的「義俠」行徑。他們中了古來俠客故事之迷，祗聽了一面之詞，動輒拔刀相助。雖說目無法紀，但居心却原不壞。而老弟元心帮中人見獵心喜，此輩仰慕白相人風儀已久，居然也想學習白相人那一套，但終缺少白相人的帮黨背景。外加生活逼人，不得不走歪路以求金錢。因此就有「擺虎勢」的丐帮出現。在窮極無聊之時，專事走動大街小巷。遇了生風作浪，總以從中取利爲月的。他們漸漸地組成了一「包相打」的機構。結果祗須給錢，便可代人打架。其行徑實與義俠性的白相人相差十萬八千里之遠。但非已「出道」而魄力雄厚的，仍舊不足言此。所以此　對內必須具有「人頭熟」，「資格老」的地位，對外允須對各地段各帮口的正號「白相人」都很熟悉，方才够算是「兜得轉」，而可以開始此種「包相打」的本行生意。</p>

<p>上海原屬五方難處，良　不齊。尤其是下層社會中，糾紛仇怨之爭端，每日不下數十百起。帮丐在街頭巷尾滿佈通訊綱，一行警報，便開始動員參加，認爲生意經上門了。在紛爭事端初起時，雙方總是互張聲勢，各走極端。此輩便插身其間，替一方大抱不平，力主强硬對付，並且自吿奮勇，情願拔刀相助。爲當事人「紮台型」。（爭面子之謂。）當事人自然感激不盡。於是劍拔弩張，雙方勢成決裂。非「喫講茶」「講斤頭」不可。評理如得解紛，丐帮中人多少也得點好處。如談判破裂，勢必開始兇毆劇鬥，而用得到此　「英雄好漢」的質命了。</p>
<p>在武　序幕之先，丐幫逐代當事人招集兵將，視對方勢力大小而定額數。自幾十人至幾百人，帮中反正人才濟濟，不需半大工夫，便可一呼而集。在開火之先，此輩便和當事人舉行一番口頭協定。規定每人「車飯扒」多少，開火後如有「掛彩」（傷），「倒爪」（死），或「摘站牢」（被捕）等情，每名酬謝多少。都須預先言明。此種一應車飯酬勞金，丐頭往往中　過半。雙方一塲毆鬥之後，，操必四出搜　，於是出手的丐流必須暫「避風頭」這　開　也須向當事人追啄。</p>
<p>從中圖利</p>
<p>但是「世膩月下」，丐帮之「包相打』也越來鱸狡猾。他們往往「虛　虎勢」以博當事人的歡心。看看雙方殺氣騰騰，戰　一觸即發，可是結果往往不觸亦不發。眞的演出全武行者十不得一，因丐帮志在金錢而不在決鬥。究竟物傷其類，誰願意爲人拚命。所以在講茶評理之時，對方如屬同帮弟兄，自然不難片言解紛，如對方係正號「白相人」，來頭較大，也儘可以拉出有面子的「老朋友」出面　解，以和平解決爲最後　契辦法。但　當事人却依舊聲勢洶洶，不甘示弱，於是酬資源源透支。等到好拿得到的錢到手後，未曾開火却突然收兵。「將在外君命有所不受」，使當事人破財而又受氣，悔不當初。但又不便鳴官呼冤，眞呌沉寃莫雪了！</p>

<h3>高考試題</h3>
<p>偶然聽到幾個朋友談起這次南京高普考以及浙省縣長考試的國文試題來，心裏着實爲一般則從學校踏入社會社會的應試者呌屈不止。我們對「善教得民諭」與「見質思齊說」「周公六事惟廉試申其義」這一類題目，是否仍帶有或多或少的八股意識，姑置不論，但現實的考試制度與敎育制度的脫節是値得詬病的。現在中學生的精力完全消耗在社會科學與自然科學的平衡發展上去不算，大學時代更要應付許多繁複而新奇的專門學術的研討，國學的進條根本就是心餘力細，所以考試而硬要以經史百家命躡，何異和年青人開玩笑？考試制度若是徒然給敎育做文飾的工具，或是僅使新的靈魂蒙上一層舊的蛻殼，這是我們這一代人的悲哀，也是國家的損失。質之當局，以爲如何？</p>
<h3>今非昔比</h3>
<p>聽說×××在美國己買了洋房和汽車，準備過他下牛世的理亂不知，黜陟不聞的寓公生活了。×將軍戎馬半生，以棉襖和草鞋起家，掙得了今日這一點點洋房和汽車，若是比起」般吮民脂膏而樂此不疲的貪官墨吏來，這種功成身退，樂享晚年的路綫實在還値得我們讚許的。不過因此我們倒有一些感想：就是，×××號稱基督將軍，基督原是以「救世」爲務的宗教；但照目前情形看，兵情形看，兵荒馬亂，蒸督大概也變得「救已」爲先了。靜安寺之爭廟產，白雲觀之燒道長，一切的宗敎都已落入「小乘」，難怪將軍而皈依基督，當然放下屠刀，拔宅西昇，先苦海蒼生而早</p>

<h3>Entering a Crucial Stage in Constitution-Making: The First Meeting of the Comprehensive Committee, The Results of the Fourth Review Committee Today Incomplete</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Constitution Draft Review Committee's incomplete groups will continue to meet on the 14th. The first, second, and seventh review committees will meet in the morning, and the first and tenth review committees will meet in the afternoon. The Comprehensive Review Committee is scheduled to hold its first decision-making meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The conveners' meeting of the Comprehensive Committee was held all day on the 13th, with the Deputy Secretary-General reporting on the results of various discussions and separately discussing the following issues as preparation for the Comprehensive Review Committee meeting: (1) the issue of the form of government; (2) the issue of the capital; (3) the issue of the National Assembly; (4) the issue of the Legislative Yuan's powers; (5) the issue of the power of consent and impeachment; (6) the issue of the Judicial Yuan's powers; (7) the issue of the Control Yuan's organization; (8) the issue of the Examination Yuan's organization; (9) the issue of examinations for public office candidates; (10) the issue of changing the name of Chapter Eleven; (11) the issue of adding clauses on provincial divisions; (12) the issue of adding articles on national economy, education and culture, and social security chapters; (13) the issue of students needing to be above party affiliation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Since the National Assembly began the group review of the draft constitution, the discussions in each review committee have been extensive and heated, with many positive and negative opinions being expressed. Representatives with special insights or proposals on relevant issues have also expressed their views on various issues. The review results may lead to significant changes to the original draft, or conflicts may arise between the various review committees. These events in the constitution-making process have reached society through newspapers and have attracted attention in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places in recent days. Some individuals have even been quite critical. For this reason, our reporter made a special visit to an important figure in the Kuomintang, who stated: "The government's proposed amendments to the draft constitution have indeed experienced twists and turns during the National Assembly's review process. This is a well-known fact, and the Kuomintang Central Committee has not ignored it. However, there are still many procedures from the initial review to the final decision in the constitution-making work. As far as the representatives participating in the various review committees are concerned, since the grouping method is based on each individual's interests, the number of people in each review committee varies. Therefore, when a certain review committee makes a resolution on a certain article of the draft constitution, the correct view is that we can only learn from this how many representatives in that review committee agree or disagree with a certain proposition or article. Although the draft constitution amendments are divided into chapters and sections, and the review is also divided into groups and sections, the intention is simply to make the outline clear and to save time through a division of labor and cooperation approach. It is by no means a piecemeal dismemberment, and it will not affect its consistent spirit. The resolutions made during the group sorting may inevitably lead to some changes to the draft constitution, and even discrepancies or contradictions may occur between the resolutions of the various review committees. However, no matter what, the overall review opinions of the draft constitution must wait until the completion of the overall sorting method. He hopes that those who care about the constitution-making work should not regard the passage or modification of a certain article of the draft constitution in a certain review committee as the final decision. It is unacceptable to think that this initial change will overthrow the theoretical and practical basis of the draft constitution and cause unnecessary worries, affecting the general public."</p>
<h3>The Second Review Committee: Decides on the Powers of the National Assembly; Session Amended to Once Every Two Years</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Second Review Committee held a full-day meeting on the 13th.

<h3>The First Review Committee: Continues to Hold Meetings Today; Chapter on the Rights and Duties of the People Has Been Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chapter Two of the Draft Constitution, "The Rights and Duties of the People," was passed in its entirety on the 13th in the First Review Committee. Today's important amendment was the addition of "When people suffer illness, disability, or death due to military service or corvée labor, the state shall provide appropriate relief and compensation to them or their families" under Article 21. Article 16 was changed to "The people's rights to survival, work, and property shall be guaranteed." Regarding articles on education and illegal acts by public officials, although there was debate, they were all passed in their original form. Since the committee still has many articles in the election chapter, it will continue to meet on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of what quotas should be allocated to occupational representatives and nationals with special living habits in various elections was supported by Jiang Wanping (a famous lawyer from Shanghai) and Cai Jinying (a famous accountant from Shanghai), a representative of freelance professionals. A concrete result was achieved in the First Review Committee on the afternoon of the 13th. The original text of the case was "The number of election quotas for occupational groups, freelance professional groups, and nationals with special living habits as stipulated in Articles 26, 65, 96, 115, and 123 of the original draft constitution shall be separately specified, and the measures shall be determined separately." The First Committee passed it by a majority vote. After which article it should be added will be discussed at the meeting on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Legislative Yuan Members Not to Exceed 500; Each Province and City May Elect at Least Four People</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Third Review Committee held a meeting this morning, chaired by Liu Keshu. He first reported on the revised articles of Article 65. After discussion, it was amended and passed. The articles are as follows: "The total number of Legislative Yuan members shall not exceed 500, and shall be composed of the following members: A. Those elected from each province and city, with at least four people from each province and city.

B. Those elected from the leagues of Mongolia and Tibet. C. Those elected from nationals residing abroad. D. Those elected from occupational groups. The election of Legislative Yuan members, the allocation of the number of Legislative Yuan members, and the percentage of women members that should be occupied in each of the preceding paragraphs shall be determined by law."</p>
<h3>National Fiscal Final Accounts Audited by the Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Third Review Committee continued to hold a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by Liu Keshu. He began to discuss Article 66. Regarding the term of office of Legislative Yuan members, some believed that three years was too long and that two years would be sufficient, while others believed that three years was not long. After a vote, the original plan was passed, and the term of office of Legislative Yuan members remained three years. Article 67 was passed in its original form. It was generally believed that Article 68 belonged to the organizational scope of the Legislative Yuan and should be deleted. After a vote, the majority agreed to pass it. Chen Changheng still advocated deleting Article 69. During the vote, Ning Encheng, Cui Weiyin, and others spoke, believing that it could not be included in the organization of the Legislative Yuan and was of great importance, so it could not be deleted. It was decided to maintain the original plan and pass it. Articles 70, 71, and 72 were all passed in their original form. Article 73 was amended and passed. The article is as follows: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions may attend and express their opinions." Article 74 concerned the issue of the right to audit the final accounts of national finance. It was discussed for a very long time. Some believed that the Legislative Yuan should clearly understand the national revenue and expenditure situation, while others believed that auditing should be the responsibility of the Control Yuan and should not be handed over to the Legislative Yuan. Some believed that Articles 74, 75, and 76 should be merged. After careful study, the three articles were merged, amended, and passed. The article is as follows: "The Executive Yuan shall, within four months after the end of the accounting year, submit the final accounts to the Control Yuan. After auditing in accordance with the law, it shall submit a report to the Legislative Yuan." Articles 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81 were all passed in their original form. The last thing discussed was Article 38: "The President" shall promulgate laws and issue orders in accordance with the law, which must be countersigned by the President of the Executive Yuan or the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions. The right to countersign is of great importance. Some believed that the President of the Executive Yuan should be changed to the President of the relevant Yuan, but after a vote, the original plan was still passed. Article 62 was also passed in its original form. The Third Review Committee has completed its entire review and has scheduled a convener's meeting for 9:00 AM on the 14th to organize the review report.</p>
<h3>Constitution Draft "Control" Chapter: All Review Completed; The Work of the Fourth Review Committee Ends</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Fourth Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held its last meeting at 9:20 AM on the 13th, chaired by Li Zhongxiang. Starting from Article 99 of Chapter Nine, "Control," except for Articles (100), (101), (106), and (109), which were passed in their original form, Article (99) was amended to "When the Control Yuan exercises the power of consent in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, it shall be done by a resolution of a majority (delete the four words 'plenary session')." (Add an annotation: "This article on the power of consent may be deleted if it does not belong to the Control Yuan.") Paragraph 2 of Article 101 was amended to "When the Control Yuan believes that central and local public officials (originally 'Executive Yuan or its various ministries and commissions') have committed dereliction of duty or illegal acts, it may propose a censure case or an impeachment case. If it involves litigation, it should be transferred to the court for handling." In Article 103, the number of Control Yuan members proposing an impeachment case was changed from "three or more people" to "one or more people." Article 104 was amended to "The impeachment of Judicial Yuan (originally 'judges') and Examination Yuan personnel for dereliction of duty or illegal acts shall apply (add four words) to the provisions of Articles 100, 102, and 103." Article 107 was amended to "Control Yuan members, except for those caught in the act (add five words) or those being prosecuted, shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Control Yuan," and sent to the Third Review Committee for reference. Article 105, which involved the special impeachment of the presidents and vice presidents of various Yuans, and Article 108, which related to the nature of the position of Control Yuan members, were both decided to be referred to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the entire work of the committee came to an end.</p>
<h3>Pure Peiping: Does Not Welcome Politicians; Xu Beihong Opposes Moving the Capital</h3>
<p>[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 13th] The local Jin Bu Daily reported today that Xu Beihong, President of the Peiping National Art Academy, strongly opposes moving the capital to Peiping. He stated: "The beautiful and pure Peiping will be stained by the arrival of base politicians, and the people of Peiping will despise various political parties and all their political activities."</p>
<h3>On the Issue of the Powers of the National Assembly: Awaiting Resolution by the Comprehensive Committee; The Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party issued the following written statement tonight regarding the Second Review Committee: "Today's discussion of the powers of the National Assembly, regarding various chapters such as 369, will be discussed by the Comprehensive Review Committee. Our party will reserve its statement today and await the discussion and resolution by the Comprehensive Review Committee."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Yang Junming, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters: "The draft constitution proposed by the government has its political origins and is not just empty talk about idealism. The Second Review Committee is discussing the National Assembly chapter. The National Assembly is a non-permanent institution and is in fact unable to supervise the government. The power of the National Assembly is too broad and it also produces legislative and supervisory members, and the five-power system cannot be guaranteed. This point needs to be considered, and we must not disappoint Chairman Chiang and the ancient heart of the military men who started the constitution."</p>
<h3>Proposals and Resolutions on Changing Exchange Rates: To Be Decided by Governments of Each Country; International Monetary Fund Scheduled to Meet Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 13th] People here believe that when the International Monetary Fund accepts the exchange rates of the currencies of its member states next week, even if the black market exchange rate of the currency of some countries is higher than its official exchange rate, such as the black market exchange rate of the French franc to the US dollar being 325 to 1, while the official exchange rate is 119 to 1, and the black market exchange rate of the Czech koruna to the US dollar being 140 to 1, while the official exchange rate is 50 to 1, the current official exchange rate of each country will be the basis. Although some directors of the International Monetary Fund advocated adopting a practical exchange rate in order to support it for a longer period, the directors with a majority of voting rights, including the United States, believe that the current environment is not yet stable and it is not appropriate to immediately determine this practical exchange rate. Furthermore, if the International Monetary Fund raises questions about some currencies, it will be unfavorable to the currency and its government. The British government strongly advocates that no avoidable changes should be made to the existing exchange rate at this time. Since Sweden changed its exchange rate in July, the British government's proposition has become more reasonable, but the Fund's acceptance of the existing exchange rate of each country's currency is only a formality, because the Fund's commencement of foreign exchange transactions will not be until March 1 next year at the earliest. Before then, some countries, especially France, will probably have adjusted their currencies or strengthened their economies. It is heard that the Fund's directors intend to visit the capitals of some countries to urge the governments to either devalue their currencies or strengthen their economic conditions so that the exchange rate matches the economic reality. The Fund itself can at most give limited and temporary support to any currency and cannot adjust its fundamental imbalances. Therefore, proposals and resolutions on changing exchange rates are the business of the governments of each country and are not the responsibility of the Fund.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Review Committee: Holds a Plenary Meeting; Enthusiastic Discussion of the Chapter on Basic National Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Seventh Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held a plenary meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by 177 representatives, chaired by Lai Lian. Leng Xin, the convener of the First National Defense and Foreign Affairs Group, reported on the five articles passed in the review and stated that it was proposed not to set up a special chapter. The convener of the Second National Economic Group reported on the five articles that had been reviewed and decided, and reported that the group would continue to meet in the afternoon to complete its work. Zhu Jiahua, the convener of the Third Education and Culture Group, reported on the ten articles passed in the review and stated that it had been decided to set up a special chapter. Gu Zhenggang, the convener of the Fourth Social Security Group, reported on the six articles passed in the review and stated that it had been decided to set up a special chapter. The representatives then spoke enthusiastically on the matter of whether the "Basic National Policies" should be divided into several special chapters. It was resolved to send it to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the plenary meeting will continue on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Seventh Review Committee held a review meeting on the morning of the 13th, and the National Economic Group held a meeting in the afternoon. In the morning, it was chaired by Lai. Each group reported on the review results. Leng Xin reported on the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Group's resolution that no special chapter should be set up for national defense, and whether the National Policy should be divided into chapters should be submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee. Liu Zhendong reported on the National Economic Group, and Zhu Jiahua reported on the Education and Culture Group's resolution to set up a separate Education chapter. Gu Zhenggang reported on the Social Security Group's resolution to request the establishment of a special chapter, and Shao Lizi reported in detail on the drafting process of the entire National Policy chapter. In the afternoon, the group meeting was chaired by Liu Zhendong Wang, and two temporary proposals were passed: (1) Leng Shaoquan et al. proposed the use of science to build water conservancy, improve agriculture, and promote agricultural industrialization; (2) Cheng Xiaogang et al. proposed that all those who participate in enterprises with mental or dynamic labor should be recognized that their labor has the right to share the rights of shareholders who contribute capital, and the calculation method of capital and subsequent regulations shall be determined by law.</p>
<h3>Women Account for 20 Percent of the Proportion in Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] What proportion women should account for in various elections was hotly debated in the afternoon of the 13th in the Constitution Draft Review Committee. This matter is of great importance to 200 million female compatriots, and all female representatives paid close attention. Nearly 40 people came to the meeting specifically for this matter, accounting for almost half of the attendees. Female representative Tao Jitian took the floor first and expressed her gratitude to the male representatives for supporting equality in marriage between men and women, and hoped that they could also help in the election aspect so that she could overcome the difficulties. Female representative Fei Xia then stood up and appealed for the female compatriots who have been oppressed for 5,000 years. Fei said: "According to the principle of equality between men and women, women originally have 50 percent of the rights, so why only propose that women should not account for less than 20 percent of the quotas in various elections? The reason why I agree to this unequal treaty (general laughter) is that in view of the current situation, women are not like men in thought, economy, and culture due to thousands of years of restraint, so I am making this practical request, hoping that representatives from all walks of life can support women and move forward step by step to serve the country and fulfill their obligations (male and female representatives applauded). So that we can move forward side by side in 20 or 30 years." Fei then explained that a country that does not respect women is like being hemiplegic, and everything cannot be promoted, and cited Germany and Japan as examples. Finally, she explained that governing a country and bringing peace to the world must start from governing a family, and women bear more responsibility for governing a family than men. She hoped to support this request from the female representatives. Representative Fei's speech was very inflammatory, and everyone in the audience was moved. After the speech, female representatives rushed to the front to comfort her. Another female representative, Guo Changhe, also said: "Men have participated in politics for 5,000 years, while women have only 30 years of experience, and it is undeniable that they are not like men. It is also conceivable that they cannot compete with men in the length of one day in the election in the future. If there is no such provision, women will definitely suffer a great loss." Most of the male representatives expressed sympathy for this, and even those who opposed only spoke on the facts and did not disagree in principle. Only Wu Yanhuan and others pointed out that if women demand 20 percent, other representatives of farmers, religions, and border areas will also make this request. How should it be handled? Zhang Xiulan and others sternly refuted, pointing out that there are also women among the above-mentioned various representatives, and this matter cannot be compared with women's participation in politics. The discussion has lasted for a while, and the entire mood of the meeting is to pass it. The chairman then put it to a vote. Seventy-four of the ninety-one people present agreed. No female representative raised their hand. The appeal that 200 million female compatriots have made unanimously for 5,000 years has finally passed the first difficult hurdle under the united strength of more than 30 female representatives. After the vote, the female representatives were all happy and congratulated each other.</p>
<h3>Tongue-Lashing and Lip-Snatching in the National Assembly Lounge; Petition from Beijing Municipal Councilors; Stating Reasons Why It Is Not Necessary to Move the Capital to Peiping</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Although the First Review Committee of the National Assembly passed the establishment of the capital in Peiping on the 12th, the people of Nanjing are still unwilling. They launched a campaign to reverse the decision on the 13th. At the same time, because Li, a representative of the Committee, stated in yesterday's Review Committee that the reason why the capital should be moved to Peiping was "Nanjing is the capital of Wang Jingwei and the capital of national humiliation," giving the citizens of Nanjing a great stimulus, the first congress of the Nanjing Municipal Council was held on the morning of the 13th. A motion was made on the spot to form a "Nanjing Citizens' Representative Petition Group to Support Nanjing as the Capital," composed of all municipal councilors, to petition the National Assembly, requesting two items: (1) State the reasons why it is not necessary to move the capital to Peiping and why Nanjing should be established as the capital. (2) Punish Li He. Led by the chairman and vice-chairman Chen Yuguang and Chen Yaodong, they arrived at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM. Sun Ke, the chairman of the presidium, and Hong Lanyou, the secretary-general, met them in the second lounge. Chen Yuguang, Chen Yaodong, Gai Fuchu, and others spoke one after another, with intense emotions, especially expressing their indignation at Li He's improper wording. They began to disperse one after another at 12:00 PM. The conversation went as follows: Chen Yuguang said: "The government has only recently returned to the capital, and the people's hearts are not at peace. Now we hear that the National Assembly has disputes over the issue of moving the capital, which all the councilors believe is inappropriate, so we are here to petition." Chen Yaodong said: "December 13th is one of the most painful days. On this day in 1937, the compatriots in Nanjing suffered the most brutal massacre, and 300,000 compatriots were killed. We are here today to petition, which has the most important significance. If the country wants stability, it should not have any prejudice against the issue of moving the capital and should take the facts into consideration. In the Father of the Nation's industrial plan, it is said that Nanjing has high mountains, deep water, and plains, making it an ideal metropolis. Therefore, to say that moving the capital is a violation of the Father of the Nation's will, which not only the Kuomintang should abide by, but also all parties and factions should abide by. The reasons for moving the capital in various countries are nothing more than two points: (1) For revolutionary reforms, such as the Northern Expedition reforms and the Turkish revolution, the capital was moved. (2) Forced by war, such as the French move of the capital from Paris and the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Moscow, were all due to war. Other than that, there is no precedent in history. If the capital is really moved one day, it will be equivalent to sacrificing 300,000 compatriots in our capital city in vain." The wording was very painful. Then a certain councilor explained the two matters of today's petition: one is to request to maintain Article 7 of the draft constitution, that is, it is not necessary to move the capital; and the other is to punish Li He. Sun Ke then delivered a speech saying: "Since the founding of the Republic of China, the capital has been established in Nanjing (applause from all). During the Xinhai Revolution, the Father of the Nation established the capital in Nanjing. Later, due to Yuan Shikai's relations, it was forced to move to Peiping. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition in Guangzhou, the capital was restored to Nanjing. Nine years ago, it was moved to Chongqing due to the impact of the war. Now that victory has arrived, the capital has been restored to Nanjing. Therefore, in terms of 'establishing the capital,' there is no doubt that it is Nanjing. What the National Assembly is discussing is moving the capital, not establishing the capital. The forced move of the capital to Peiping in the early Republic of China and the move to Chongqing during the War of Resistance were all last resorts. Could it be that the National Assembly has encountered a last resort that requires moving the capital? I cannot represent the National Assembly in answering whether the capital will be moved in the future, but I want to tell you on behalf of the government 'the capital is established in Nanjing.'" Then Gai Fuchu and others said: "What Representative Li said in the meeting that Nanjing is the capital of Wang Jingwei is not only an insult to the citizens of Nanjing, but also an insult to the people of the whole country. I hereby request the Assembly that Representative Li should apologize to all compatriots." "It is not only an insult to our citizens of Nanjing, but also an insult to our Father of the Nation, because Nanjing was established as the capital, which was the Father of the Nation's proposal, not what Wang Jingwei decided. We want to shoot him." "We want to cry at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum." "We want to impeach Representative Li." "We want to put Representative Li in Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and shoot him." Sun Ke withdrew first, and Hong was also surrounded. The crowd was extremely agitated. Finally, they made a strong appeal, "Please convey to the presidium the request that Representative Li apologize. If the goal cannot be achieved, we will launch millions of citizens to petition the presidium." "We demand a public trial of Li He." Tongue-lashing and lip-snatching in the lounge broke out at the same time. The fierce debate ended at nearly 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, stated in an interview with reporters on the morning of the 13th that the Democratic League would not participate in the National Assembly for the following reasons: (1) This move deviates slightly from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (2) Since the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet yielded results, the participation of the Democratic League in the National Assembly may hinder future mediation efforts, thus unnecessarily creating obstacles to democratic peace. We firmly believe that military actions cannot be sustained for long, and the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will ultimately be resolved through political means. Once the opportunity for negotiation arises again, the Democratic League will do its utmost to mediate. At the same time, while the Democratic League seeks to participate in the National Assembly, it sincerely hopes that a democratic constitution will be drafted to reduce obstacles to peace. Mr. Zhang will fly to Shanghai on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Constitution's Provincial and County System Changed to Local System; Eighth Review Committee Passes Entire Proposal</h3>

The details are as follows: A. It was agreed to increase the number of representatives from Mongolia and Tibet for the National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors based on Article 5, "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal under the law," and this was transferred to the comprehensive sub-group for discussion and regulation.

Proposals No. 148 by Representative Pu (Ru) and No. 89 by Representative Huang Zhengqing were sent to the comprehensive sub-group for discussion due to their relation to elections. When the discussion was completed, a representative stood up and shouted "Long live the Republic of China," which was echoed by everyone present.</p>
<h3>National Assembly's Female Representatives Fight for Marriage Charter; Relaxed Atmosphere and Laughter Fill the Meeting Hall</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of marriage between men and women was raised in a somewhat humorous manner at today's first review committee of the draft constitution. Female representatives fought for their own interests, and some male representatives even stated that they were "speaking under the orders of their wives" to express their support, a stark contrast to the heated debate over the capital city issue. After the review of all the articles in Chapter 2, the original proposer of the motion, Lü Xiaoda, stood up to explain, first reciting the original text of the proposal in her Zhejiang dialect, saying: "Marriage should be established based on the free will of the man and woman involved. Husband and wife should mutually protect their equal rights and interests. Marriage, divorce, property, inheritance, and household registration laws should be formulated based on the principles of safeguarding individual dignity and equality." She explained, "Marriage is an important part of human life, and it is related to the prosperity of the nation and the security of society. After the war of resistance, marital chaos has become increasingly serious, and the impact is not limited to disrupting society and destroying families. The constitution does not have a single word about marriage, which is a major omission. Please include it explicitly." Before she finished speaking, the female representatives shouted, "No objection! No objection! Please pass it!" Just as they hoped to pass it in a "fast track" manner, a male representative suddenly shouted: "I object!" The male representatives applauded in support, and the female representatives were all taken aback. Yu Zheng then rose to speak, explaining that the Civil Code already has clear provisions for this matter, and there is no need to specify it in the Constitution. As soon as these words were spoken, the female representative Zhang Xiulan, who was sitting behind him, jumped up and questioned: "Chinese men take marriage too lightly. It is not enough to regulate marriage only in the Civil Code. Look at the cities, those who have resources and money, which one doesn't have another arrangement?" The crowd laughed, and some whistled. The military police, not understanding the situation, peeked into the venue to observe. "This kind of arrangement not only disrupts family order, but also undermines social stability. This matter is not only a women's issue, but also a social issue. After it is stipulated in the constitution, it will also be beneficial to you men, please pay attention." Of course, not all the male representatives were against the female compatriots. Yin Shu whispered to the female representative Tao Jitian and others for a moment, then stood up and said: "Brothers are not speaking under the orders of their wives." "The issue of marriage between men and women is indeed a social issue worthy of attention. We all have children, and we should also consider it for the sake of our next generation." The female representatives applauded when they saw male representatives supporting the female representatives, and the power of the women's faction in the venue seemed to rise slightly. Unexpectedly, another male representative, Mou Zhendong, stood up to oppose, and his first words were: "Brothers do not think this is necessary." The female representatives let out a collective sigh, and hisses filled the air. "It is true that polygamy exists, but there have also been cases of polyandry (the crowd laughed). These cases are all done with the consent of both men and women, please pay attention." He only spoke for a little over ten minutes, but he earned more laughter, applause, and hisses than any other representative. At this time, the meeting hall was no longer in the mood for discussion, and it was only two or three minutes away from the break. The male representative Pan Chaoying, mixed in with the female representatives, stood up to salvage the situation, saying: "The issue of marriage concerns both women and men. We should discuss it seriously. I propose that we leave it for discussion this afternoon." The representatives agreed, and the morning session ended with laughter. The Review Committee continued to meet in the afternoon. Before 3:00 PM, the female representatives arrived one after another, totaling more than 33, accounting for the majority of the female representatives of the National Assembly. Lü Xiaoda also actively lobbied, hoping to persuade some of the male representatives who opposed the motion. At 3:30 PM, the meeting began. Li Junfu, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, first stated that his party agreed to the demands of the female representatives, but said that this was a "problem between people." At the same time, the marriage systems of other ethnic groups are different from the Han ethnicity, please consider this. Yuan Shiyuan sympathized with this request, but hoped to add it to the chapter on fundamental national policies, to which some female representatives also agreed. Zhang Xiufeng, a well-spoken and eloquent female representative, proposed a new motion, advocating the strict implementation of the "one husband, one wife system," with severe penalties for violators. She also explained the reason for placing the word "wife" above the word "husband," which caused everyone to laugh. Another representative even made a strange remark, arguing that local inspectors should report anyone who violates the one-husband, one-wife system. In the end, the vote was unanimously in favor of passing the motion, and it was decided to transfer the proposal to the discussion.</p>

Bing Shi, the political commissar of the Su (county) Huai (yuan) county government of the Communist forces, defected to our Mengcheng county government a few days ago with more than 800 troops because he opposed the Communist forces' destructive acts.</p>
<h3>Western Shandong Situation Tense Again; Communist Forces Crossing Yellow River to Invade Heze; Local Qingping Team Drives Away Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The situation in western Shandong has become tense again. The 2nd, 3rd, and 8th Divisions of the Communist forces, after capturing Puyang, are now crossing the Yellow River south and heading towards western Shandong, with the intention of invading Heze.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Taisheng's unit of the 12th Brigade of the New Fourth Army of the Communist forces, with over ten thousand people, fled from the counties of Shang, Xia, Bo, and Qi in eastern Henan to northern Anhui. They recently captured Yuanxiji and are now preparing to attack Taihe and Fuyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The Communist forces in Qingping County, western Shandong, were driven out of the county seat on the 8th by the local teams and the people, fleeing towards the northeast, while another part fled towards the southwest. The county is now guarded by local teams, awaiting the National Army to restore order. In addition, the Communist forces in Tangyi County, western Shandong, are actively preparing to invade, and are forcibly requisitioning food from the people on a large scale, transporting it to Linqing in dozens of trucks every day. The goods of commercial firms such as Minsheng Minli, which are operated by the Communist forces in the city, are mostly transported to Wuzhen (35 kilometers northwest of Tangyi City) for storage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The Communist forces are increasingly actively trying to win over Shandong. Recently, they have successively transferred heavy troops from the Northeast and northern Jiangsu to Shandong, intending to destroy the Jiaoji Railway and defend the Jiaodong corridor. The Communist forces in southern Hebei are again threatening the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in southwestern Shandong. The Communist forces in the border area between Hebei and Shandong are gathering in Dezhou, cutting off north-south traffic, and then besieging the provincial capital. At the same time, they are launching political offensives and strengthening economic struggles. Recent developments are as follows: (1) The Emergency Mobilization Committee of the People of the Communist Forces Liberated Areas was officially established on November 2, with Mei Liyu as the chairman, and recently issued an order to complete the preparations for strengthening the walls and clearing the fields within a time limit.</p>

However, after the Communist forces entered the city, they carried out major destruction and had no intention of holding it. A certain military expert pointed out that the government's current military strategy is to "press the nails." All the forces are used to defend every county and town and cannot be used flexibly. The Communist forces can concentrate their forces to remove the "nails" that they can remove. The number of guns lost due to the sporadic losses after the recovery of eastern Hebei alone is no less than two thousand.</p>

<h3>Mystery of Receiving Dalian City; National Army Has in Fact Reached City Border; Communist Forces Stop "Struggle" Due to Public Resistance</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] According to the reporter's synthesis of news from various sources, a part of the National Army arrived at Dongdaheshang Mountain (also known as Laohushan) in Jinzhou a week ago, but did not enter Jinzhou city and railway station. Daheshang Mountain is the border line of Dalian city. The right wing seems to be in the area of the mountain southwest of the railway. In addition, another part of the advance troops seems to be in the Nanguanling and Ganjingzi area of the waist of the peninsula, which has entered the city boundary. As for the main National Army force, it is said to be still near Shihe, which is the boundary of the defense area of the Lüshun Naval Base jointly used by China and the Soviet Union. According to people from Dalian, the Soviet Union will have 1,500 merchants coming to Datong from Vladivostok, of which more than 370 merchants arrived in Dalian half a month ago with their families. In addition, three ships fully loaded with cotton yarn, flag cloth, sugar, and matches came along. Some people use this to counter-prove that there will not be a major war in Dalian, because the Soviet Union has already made commercial plans to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] In view of the increased public resistance, the Datong Communist forces have stopped "liquidation" and "struggle".</p>

The defending army has only two battalions, fighting with outnumbered forces, and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. The Communist forces used a large amount of explosives to attack the city, with the later batch alone transported by 32 mules. The quantity and viciousness of their intention can be imagined. At present, the highlands outside the city have all fallen. The Communist forces are concentrating their strength, using toxic gas, artillery fire, and explosives to bombard the city fiercely. The situation is extremely critical. As of the morning of the 12th, the battle was still going on fiercely. The National Army reinforcements have advanced to more than 30 li away from Zhongyang. If the defending army in the city can hold on until the evening of the 12th, the siege can be lifted.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] After the Communist forces in the suburbs of Zhongyang occupied Nanshan, they used it as cover to launch a fierce attack on the south city, and the sappers carried a large amount of explosives to bomb the city walls. The National Army is bravely resisting. At the same time, the artillery fire of the Communist forces besieging Beishan is becoming more intense, and all positions have been destroyed. At around 10:00 AM on the 11th, Beishan was also captured. In the evening, the Communist forces continued to launch a fierce attack on the city walls.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] On the morning of the 10th, the National Army defeated the Communist forces in Yiluozhen, northwest of Yuanqu City.

In addition, He Kaizhang's 20th Brigade of the Communist forces, about 6,000 people, has crossed west from Xing County and is now stationed in the area south of Jia County. Recently, the number of Communist forces in northern Shaanxi has indeed increased significantly, and they seem to be preparing to attack Yichuan and Luochuan.</p>
<h3>British Trade Mission Leader's Briefcase Stolen; Returning to England Empty-Handed Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] The briefcase of Sir Bowes, the leader of the British Trade Mission to China, was stolen on the streets of Hong Kong yesterday.

"I believe that this trip has especially strengthened the connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland," and can prove the care of our government for the welfare and interests of overseas Chinese. Every time we arrive at a place, the overseas Chinese welcome us with unprecedented enthusiasm and hope, even in the scorching sun and rainstorms. Mr. Li said: "This visit also made the Dutch East Indies authorities understand the concern of our government for the treatment of overseas children. The Indonesian authorities and people now have a clearer understanding of the situation of overseas Chinese and have realized the necessity of improving their treatment." During the Goodwill Mission's two-month stay in various parts of Nanyang, we were overwhelmed with visits to various places, holding discussions, and attending major meetings.

<h3>Six Difficult Factors for Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Sichuan Province - Investigation Team Publishes Research Results on Poverty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th] The Sichuan Provincial Government Industrial and Mining Investigation Team recently published the general difficulties of industrial and mining enterprises in Sichuan Province based on the results of their investigations in various regions, which are nothing more than the following: (1) Lack of working capital, high interest rates, and tight deadlines. National banks have complicated loan procedures, making it impossible for small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises to survive, leading to increased costs, financial depletion, and reduced production. In general, medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises feel that equipment and tools are insufficient. Although they have natural advantages, it is not easy to survive and develop, especially the difficulty in solving the problem of power. (2) Most industrial and mining enterprises are still in the old-fashioned manual handicraft stage, lacking specialized technology and industrial and commercial management talent, wasting human, financial, and material resources. (3) Industrial and mining enterprises are generally troubled by the transportation of materials and products, stagnant funds, and increased costs. (4) Foreign goods flood the market, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the people's purchasing power is weak. (5) Production and sales are not coordinated, supply and demand do not match, trade associations are poorly organized, and government promotion, protection, and supervision lack strength. (6) Failure to effectively cultivate, promote, improve, inspect raw material varieties, and focus on maintaining and developing rural sideline industries, resulting in increasingly scarce and inferior raw materials, leading to the withering of industrial and mining enterprises.</p>

<h3>On the Interpretation and Declaration of Laws that Violate the Constitution</h3>
<p>— Luo Bida</p>
<p>Since the draft constitution of the Republic of China was personally submitted by Chairman Chiang of the National Government to the National Assembly for deliberation on the 28th of last month, there has been enthusiastic sentiment from all sides, and the fundamental law of the country has been discussed in detail. All issues regarding the National Assembly and the capital have been revised and changed, which is gratifying. Now that the work of deliberating on the draft constitution is nearing completion, an important issue has been neglected, namely the interpretation and declaration of laws that violate the constitution.</p>
<p>Article 147 of the draft constitution stipulates: "Laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid. If there is doubt as to whether a law conflicts with the constitution, it shall be interpreted by the Judicial Yuan." The author believes that this provision is open to discussion. It is natural that laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid, otherwise the constitution would have no guarantee and could not become the fundamental law of the country, the mother of all laws. There are two types of laws that violate the constitution: one is a formal violation of the constitution, and the other is a substantive violation of the constitution. A formal violation of the constitution refers to a law whose formulation and provisions clearly conflict with the constitution, while a substantive violation of the constitution refers to a law that, while not obviously violating the constitution, has results in its implementation that conflict with the spirit of the constitution. A formal violation of the constitution is obvious and absolute, while a substantive violation of the constitution is relative. The so-called violation of the constitution should naturally include both formal and substantive aspects, and substantive violations should be given more attention, and whether they violate the constitution must be decided very carefully. Examining examples from various countries, except for the 1920 constitution of Czechoslovakia, which distinguishes between formal and substantive violations of the constitution, the other countries do not explicitly distinguish between violations as formal or substantive. Because formal violations of the constitution are absolute and easier to judge, the 1920 constitution of Czechoslovakia stipulates that they should be reviewed by ordinary courts. Substantive violations, because they are relative, are reviewed by a specially established constitutional court for the sake of caution. It is generally believed that under the constitutional system of the separation of powers, the Congress is solely responsible for making laws, the president for promulgating laws, and the courts for applying laws. If a law is made and promulgated in accordance with the law, the court should apply it. If the court is given the power to review whether a law violates the constitution, the court will be suspected of infringing on the rights of the Congress. Therefore, in Austria, whether federal laws or state laws conflict with the federal constitution is not reviewed by ordinary courts, but by a specially established constitutional court (Verfassunggerichtshef). The United States is the most prominent example of a country that recognizes the right of ordinary courts to review whether laws violate the constitution, and the Federal Supreme Court exercises this power. The Federal Supreme Court of the United States has a total of nine judges. Six judges present at each hearing are sufficient for a quorum. All judgments can be made as long as the majority opinion of the judges present is consistent. Therefore, if eight or nine people are present, only five people need to agree to make a judgment. If six or seven people are present, only four people need to agree to make a judgment. It seems unreasonable that the opinion of these four or five people can overturn a law made by hundreds of people in Congress. Moreover, judges are also human beings, and as human beings, their political, economic, ethical, and social thoughts are inevitably influenced by the environment and are biased. Therefore, whether a law is judged by judges to be constitutional or not inevitably depends on the judge's own views, and they will choose to declare as unconstitutional those things that are unfavorable to their own environment. Because the power of judgment in the hands of judges has this drawback, the Weimar Constitution of Germany does not allow the courts to review whether federal laws violate the constitution. If there is a violation of the constitution, it should be proposed by the Senate, the president, or the citizens, and decided by a referendum. This method is of course very democratic. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, including the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, passed by Congress during his first term, was thwarted by the Federal Supreme Court's declaration that they were unconstitutional. Because the failure of the New Deal affected the improvement of people's lives, there has recently been a movement in the United States to improve this shortcoming. There are three plans: the first is that if a court declares a law unconstitutional, the court's judgment should be submitted to a referendum. If the citizens object to the court's judgment, the law should be valid. The second is that if a court declares a law unconstitutional, the law should be submitted to Congress for reconsideration. If Congress still maintains the original draft, the law can be valid. The third is that the court should review whether a law violates the constitution based on the opinion of two-thirds of all judges, and should not only use a majority opinion as the standard. If at least six of the nine judges believe it is unconstitutional, the law will be invalid. In the first plan, the power to decide whether a law is unconstitutional rests with the citizens. In the second plan, the power to decide rests with Congress. In the third plan, the power to decide rests with an absolute majority of the judges. The decision-making power rests with the citizens. The theory is the best, but it is the most difficult to exercise in practice, especially in China, with its large territory and large population, the difficulty of exercising it will be even greater. It is more convenient to exercise the decision-making power in Congress, but if Congress makes an unconstitutional law, especially a law that expands the power of Congress, there is no way to deal with it if Congress does not recognize it as unconstitutional. As a result, Congress will inevitably become autocratic, and the constitution will not be able to be guaranteed. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the decision-making power to remain in the courts. However, judges must be very careful when exercising this power. In order to increase the degree of their caution, Article 147 of the draft constitution should preferably be amended as follows: "Laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid. The Judicial Yuan shall interpret whether a law conflicts with the constitution. The Judicial Yuan shall submit laws that are judged to conflict with the constitution to the President for an explicit order to abolish them. If the President believes that the law is formally unconstitutional, he shall immediately order its abolition. If it is substantially unconstitutional, it shall be submitted to the Judicial Yuan for reconsideration. If two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration, the President shall order the abolition of the law."</p>
<p>This amendment has at least three major advantages:</p>
<p>First, it forms a relationship of checks and balances between the executive and judicial branches, because the courts can judge laws to be unconstitutional, the president can request reconsideration, and the law only needs to be explicitly repealed if two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration. If a law judged by the court to be unconstitutional takes effect no matter what, then if the judges believe that something is unfavorable to them, they will declare it unconstitutional, and the court will inevitably infringe on rights, and the judicial organs will inevitably be suspected of being autocratic. Now, laws that have been judged by the court to be unconstitutional can be submitted by the president for reconsideration, and the law will only be invalid if two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration. This forms a relationship of checks and balances between the executive and judicial branches, and a relationship of checks and balances is a good symbol of a constitution.</p>
<p>Second, it can avoid erroneous judgments by the courts. Judges are human beings, and all human beings are inevitably wrong. Even if the judges' review is fair and cautious, it is still inevitable that there will be mistakes. Therefore, ordinary cases often have preliminary hearings, rehearings, and third trials, and sometimes even retrials are allowed. However, for major events regarding whether a law is unconstitutional or not, retrials are not allowed. This seems unreasonable. Now, after the amendment, there is an opportunity for retrials, which is naturally very suitable in terms of both theory and fact.</p>
<p>Third, it can accommodate public opinion and flexibly adjust judgments. Sometimes a law's violation of the constitution is not a violation of the provisions of the constitution, but a violation of the spirit of the constitution. However, the so-called spirit of the constitution is abstract, so a law's violation of the constitution is vague and relative. Therefore, A believes that it is a violation, while B believes that it is not a violation. Because whether it is a violation can be interpreted positively or negatively, all judges cannot have a completely consistent opinion. Because there is no completely consistent opinion, the best judgment should be based on public opinion. However, the people do not pay attention to whether a law is unconstitutional before it has been judged to be unconstitutional. Because the people do not pay attention, the judges have no way of knowing public opinion. Now, after the amendment, there is an opportunity for retrials. The people will inevitably pay attention during the retrial, especially to laws that have a direct relationship with the people. Because of their attention, they will study it, and because of their research, they will obtain the correct result. The courts have an opportunity for retrials. On the one hand, the research can be thorough, and on the other hand, public opinion can be clear. The judgment made in this way can naturally be very appropriate. The president must execute this judgment, which is also appropriate. Because such a judgment is not only correct but also pays attention to public opinion. For the sake of these three major advantages, I humbly present my views for the correction of wise people.</p>
<h3>The Steadfast Hero Sleeps Forever at the Foot of Yuquan Mountain - Wu Peifu to be Publicly Buried the Day After Tomorrow - Chairman Sends You Siyuan to Represent and Offer Sacrifices</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Wu Peifu will be publicly buried on the 16th. Today, Chairman Chiang has telegraphed He Siyuan to represent him and offer sacrifices at that time.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 13th] With Wu Peifu's public burial approaching, Wu's son, Daoshi, entertained reporters at his private residence in Shijin Garden today, recalling how Wu refused to be a puppet under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, which caused the Japanese to harbor resentment. In the 28th year of the Republic, after Wu fell ill, the doctor at the Tongren Hospital performed an operation without obtaining the signature of Wu's family, and then did not inject a cardiotonic drug, causing Wu to die of a minor illness. Wu's son said: Before Wu passed away, he swore not to be a puppet, and then closed his eyes. Wu was old and had no son. Daoshi was adopted as his nephew. He now has two grandsons, both studying at Yuying Middle School. The eldest grandson is 18 years old and loves music and art, which is very different from his grandfather. Wu's wife is still alive, but because Wu did not manage his property during his lifetime, the family is currently not wealthy. The marshal's wife often carries a basket to the market to buy vegetables. Wu enjoyed poetry and prose in his later years, and his proud works include "Spring and Autumn Justice," "On the Gentleman," and "New Book on Following One's Duty," most of which have been published. Friends and relatives plan to organize them into a complete collection. Three days later, this generation of steadfast heroes will sleep forever at the foot of Yuquan Mountain in Xixian Huying Village. According to Wu's son: The reason for choosing this place is that he wants Marshal Yu to find his place.</p>

<h3>Rampant Banditry in the Suburbs of Changshu - Self-Defense Force Disarmed and Town Mayor Killed</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changshu News] Banditry has recently been discovered in Zhenlilizhen outside the Dadongmen in the urban area, and it is quite active. The county government has obtained confidential reports and is planning a raid. Unexpectedly, at about 7 pm on the 11th, they suddenly broke into the town, shot and killed the town mayor Shao Junbi and three members of the self-defense force, including Ju Gensheng. All five firearms were confiscated on the spot. Town mayor Shao Junbi also served as the head of the town's self-defense force. After attending a security meeting with the garrison troops and returning to the town, he happened to be having dinner in the team. Suddenly, many bandits with weapons arrived at the team's gate and fired shots at the gate. The guard at the gate was caught off guard and was shot several times and died on the spot. Hearing the alarm, Town Mayor Shao took the lead and led a breakout. The two sides engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand battle. In the end, the team was outnumbered. Member Ju Gensheng was shot three times and fell into a pool of blood. Town Mayor Shao was captured by the bandits and taken to the market, where he was shot and killed. At the same time, five self-defense force firearms were confiscated by the bandits. The injured member Ju Gensheng was escorted to the city for medical treatment, but eventually died due to excessive bleeding from the serious chest and abdominal wounds. After the news spread, the whole city was shocked. County Mayor Pan was furious that the bandits were so rampant, since the town was only ten li away from the city.

<h3>Restoring the Fan Family Library of Ningbo to Tianyige</h3>
<p>[Our Ningbo Dispatch] The Tianyige Library of the Fan family in Ningbo was established by Fan Qin, then Vice Minister of War, during the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty.

<p>The Jiaxing Road Bridge is Being Surveyed for Repairs</p>
<p>Regarding reader Sun Bingwen's appeal to repair the Jiaxing Road Bridge, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has replied, "The bureau has ordered a survey and handling of the matter." This is published to inform Mr. Sun.</p>
<p>The Route of the Ninth and Tenth Bus Lines</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company has replied, "Regarding reader Zhou Desheng's concern about the route of the Tenth Bus Line, we offer the following explanation: The route of the Tenth Bus Line was decided after a meeting, reported to higher authorities, and has already been put into operation. Therefore, it is not convenient to change it immediately. At that time, considering that this line is a major transportation artery in the city, and passengers are crowded, there was a great need for it. After deliberation, it was decided that its purpose is to supplement the inadequacy of the trams. Although the Third and Tenth Bus Lines are parallel routes, they each have their own needs and do not conflict. The committee has also considered Mr. Zhou's suggestion to restore the former British-owned Ninth Bus Line, but this will have to wait until there are sufficient vehicles."

<p>Discussion of the Telephone Business in This City</p>
<p>Respectfully, I read in the newspaper that Director Yu of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau gave a speech at Jiaotong University on the history of Shanghai telephones and future reorganization plans, which was quite insightful. The Shanghai telephone business has long been in the hands of foreigners, causing the communications authorities in our country to be constrained in handling telephone services. Moreover, when citizens call each other, they have to go through manual transfers between two institutions, which not only causes delays but also places an additional burden of connection fees on citizens. This kind of shortcoming is unique to our country. As for future reform plans, it is indeed true that the government is unable to take it back due to insufficient financial resources. A special limited liability company jointly established by China and the United States is a more appropriate approach, but the government must obtain the right to manage and supervise it in order to benefit the citizens.

<h3>Zhi Lao's Visit to Wuxi: Dividing the Estate for a Late Friend, Sweeping Wu Zhiying's Grave, and Discussing the Past and Present While Explaining Each Sentence of the Datong Pian</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and a native of this county, has been traveling between Beijing and Shanghai since the victory for over half a year and has not yet had time to return to his hometown. Recently, the former residence of his late friend, Mr. Lian Nanhu, near the Shuidaqiao Bridge, was completely sealed by the Jiangsu Office of the Enemy Property Administration because it was involved in the case of his younger brother, Lian Yu (the puppet ambassador to Manchukuo). Mr. Lian Nanhu had not divided the estate with Lian Yu before his death, so the inherited property belonged to the brothers jointly. However, because Lian Yu held an important position in the puppet government and violated national laws, all his property should be sealed according to law. However, this has affected the interests of others, and those affected can apply for protection. Wu Zhihui has a deep friendship with Mr. Lian Nanhu, and the Lian family is currently in dire straits. Therefore, he spared time to return to Wuxi from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 12th. Because he kept it secret in advance, only Chen Zikuan and Sun Zhenqiu were at the station to greet him. After Zhi Lao got off the train, he went directly to the Park Hotel to rest. Later, he invited relatives of the Lian family to a public meeting to divide the estate between Nanhu, Lian Yu, and their descendants. It is planned to apply to the competent authorities after the agreement is drawn up. In addition to confiscating the part that should be allocated to Lian Yu, the rest should be returned to the family. On the morning of the 13th, he also took time to sweep the grave of Mrs. Wu Zhiying, Mr. Nanhu's wife, with relatives of the Lian family in Wuxi. Mrs. Zhiying was a close friend of the martyr Qiu Jin, the female knight of Jianhu. After the female knight was martyred in Shaoxing, Mrs. Zhiying collected her remains and moved them to the West Lake, earning fame for her righteousness. Her thin gold style calligraphy is especially well-known and has long been admired by Zhi Lao. Mrs. Zhiying passed away before the war due to illness, and her remains were buried in Yanjia Peng in Huilu. This time, Zhi Lao came to Wuxi to pay his respects to his old friend. Zhi Lao, wearing a blue silk lambskin robe, with a bald head and a childlike face, sat dignifiedly among the guests in the Chen residence on Xinsheng Road, feeling very excited. He spoke eloquently and discussed the past and present, sometimes with humor, and showed no signs of fatigue for two hours. According to Zhi Lao, the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is like "ghosts fooling the sky" and "ghosts pushing the mill." He also said that Trotsky once said, "The world gains progress with every chaos." Although Trotsky was rejected by Stalin, his words are still accepted by the communists. Before the victory, the central government's planning and construction focused on railways. Unexpectedly, after the victory, disturbances continued, and not only were the planned railways not built, but the existing roads were being demolished, resulting in traffic disruption, hindered freight transportation, and difficult livelihoods for the people. He then said that the composition of the world has four elements: morality, economy, politics, and desire. Since the beginning of mankind, it has always leaned towards morality. If you ask anyone what they hope for in this world, they will all hope that this world will become the best possible world. It can be seen that leaning towards morality is the nature of mankind. However, humans cannot live without economics, so there will inevitably be disputes. To restrain these disputes, there is politics, and people have their own desires. Due to the development of desires, chaos never ends. To achieve eternal peace, it is necessary to achieve Datong (Great Harmony). In the past, I was extremely opposed to Confucius, but now I am gradually becoming more respectful of Confucius. Confucius truly had a unique understanding of the development of the universe. More than two thousand years ago, he recognized that politics can only be applied in the short term, and the end point of development will be the Datong era, a great harmony era without politics or government. The Datong Pian in the Book of Rites gives a concise and meaningful description of the atmosphere of the Datong era, the method of advancing to Datong, and the special circumstances of the Datong era. When Wu said this, he explained each section and each sentence of the Datong Pian in detail, and new meanings emerged one after another, enlightening all who heard it. He went on to say that the reality of the Datong era will require at least 20,000 years. 20,000 years may seem like a long time, but from "Peking Man" to the present, it has been about 500,000 years, and the historical period of mankind, according to Europeans and Americans from the founding of Egypt to the present, is about 8,000 years. China from Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang to the present is 6,000 years. If Gu Jiegang denies Shun and Yu, then China's historical period is only more than 4,000 years. Comparing 4,000 years to 500,000 years is like a blink of an eye. Therefore, if we view the progress of the universe, 20,000 years is just a fleeting moment. Wu also said that the influx of American goods is a very natural thing, and in China, it is necessary to spend some teacher's money, which is unavoidable. Zhi Lao is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening of the 13th.</p>

<h3>Greece Accuses Three Neighboring Countries of Conspiring to Fuel Internal Turmoil; The Greek Prime Minister Appeals to the Security Council to Send a Delegation to Investigate; The Representative of Yugoslavia Countercharges That the Presence of British Troops in Greece Leads to Unrest</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 12th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris, sitting alongside representatives from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania at the Security Council today, formally proposed that the Security Council organize a four-power investigation team to go to Greece to investigate the situation of the disputes on the country's northern border. Tsaldaris strongly emphasized Greece's efforts in resisting the Axis powers during the war and stated that the country has decided to appeal to the United Nations because this seems to be the only way to restrain the unrest in northern Greece. He believes that Greece has become a victim of an "undeclared war," the purpose of which is to divide the territory of the Macedonian province of Greece and to establish a regime in Greece that violates the will of the people. The current situation in northern Greece is a danger to international peace and security. Yugoslav Representative Kasanović replied that Greece's attitude is naive and that the country wants to blame its peaceful northern neighbors for the conflicts caused by the totalitarian regime. It is not true that guerrilla teams in northern Greece have been trained in neighboring Balkan countries, as Tsaldaris claimed. The photographic evidence presented by the Greek delegation is also inaccurate. In short, the presence of British troops in Greece is largely related to the country's unrest, and the Yugoslav delegation will formally oppose conducting investigations on the southern Greek border.</p>
<p>[United Nations, Lake Success, 12th] Yugoslav Representative Kasanović today requested that the Security Council immediately send a delegation to investigate Greece's accusation that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are encouraging the Greek civil war. This surprising proposal came immediately after Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris's speech. Previously, when the Security Council discussed Ukraine's accusation against Greece, the United States proposed sending an investigation team, but the Soviet Union vetoed it. It is unexpected that Yugoslavia, which has been following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, would bring up the old matter again. Kasanović said that Tsaldaris's accusation has no basis. The current war in Greece was not caused by foreign forces but is merely due to the domestic policies adopted by Greece and its efforts to stifle the masses. The Security Council should send a delegation as soon as possible to investigate the internal situation in Greece. This situation may even become more serious because the United Kingdom, which supports Tsaldaris, still has troops stationed in Greece and should bear its responsibility. The stationing of foreign troops in Greece hinders the Greeks from expressing their true will.</p>
<h3>The United Nations General Assembly Passes a Resolution to Withdraw Envoys from Spain; The Soviet Representative Says This Measure is Not Thorough Enough</h3>

<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution with 34 votes against 6, deciding that all member states should immediately recall their ambassadors and ministers stationed in Spain. If the Spanish regime is still led by Franco, the Security Council will consider taking "appropriate measures to prohibit Spain from participating in any international organizations related to the United Nations.

<h3>The Security Council Approves Siam's Application to Join the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 12th] The Security Council unanimously resolved today to recommend to the General Assembly that Siam be allowed to join the United Nations.

<h3>The United Nations Headquarters Will Be Located in New York; Rockefeller's Donation Has Been Accepted</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] Rockefeller is willing to donate a skyscraper site in Manhattan, New York, worth $8.5 million, as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations. The Headquarters Committee recently voted 33 to 7 to accept it. Another six abstained. The proposal has now been submitted to the General Assembly for approval. Judging from the situation, the General Assembly will likely accept this New York base, which occupies about 18 acres, along the river on the west side of Manhattan Island, on which New York City is built. The subcommittee has inspected the site and believes that it is "very suitable for building a three-dimensional clubhouse."</p>
<h3>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is Coming to an End; Another General Assembly Will Be Held Next Year; We Request That Technical Experts Stay in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Representatives of all countries in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) unanimously passed a resolution today to hold another General Assembly in 1947. The current General Assembly was originally scheduled to be the last meeting of UNRRA, with European relief work scheduled to end at the end of this year and the Far East at the end of March next year. Soviet Representative Fyodorov insisted that another meeting should be held in 1947 to hear the report on UNRRA's work over the past two years, while US Representative Wood opposed it. The current resolution was proposed by the subcommittee in an attempt to reconcile the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union. After its passage, it is equivalent to guaranteeing that another General Assembly will be held before June next year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Li Zhuomin, the representative of our country attending the United Nations meeting, in order to express our country's gratitude to UNRRA, told the Council of UNRRA, which consists of 48 countries: Our country sincerely hopes that UNRRA will continue to have technical experts stay in China to assist in the receiving, distribution, and installation of UNRRA supplies until all planned supplies have been received and can ensure their effective use. He also reiterated our country's support for the resolution passed by the Fifth Session of the Council, advocating that UNRRA should make every possible effort to ensure that all plans that have been approved can be successfully completed.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Concludes, Completing the Work on Peace Treaties; A Total of 122 Meetings Were Held; The Peace Treaties with Germany and Austria Will Be Discussed in London Next Year</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] The four foreign ministers held their last meeting tonight in an atmosphere of coordination and mutual congratulations, ending the work of negotiating peace treaties with the five former Axis countries. The four foreign ministers, reclining on swan down sofas in the special conference room of the Astoria Hotel, looked forward to the Moscow conference in March 1947. US Secretary of State Byrnes smiled and suggested that if the representatives could not reach an agreement in Moscow, they could return to New York at any time, as New York seemed to be fortunate for them. After a brief discussion on the Moscow agenda, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov congratulated everyone on the success of the meeting and thanked Byrnes for the generous hospitality of the United States. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Viril also expressed their thanks. Byrnes replied that he was particularly pleased with the conclusion of the agreement in New York. The foreign ministers traveled back and forth before the final agreement on the peace treaties, and they finally succeeded, which can be said to be worth the hard work. The four foreign ministers then agreed that the experience gained in negotiating the peace treaties with the five countries would be of great benefit to the discussion of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria in the future. Byrnes said that the long-term meetings have allowed the foreign ministers to know each other's views and be able to understand each other. Regarding the Moscow agenda, the Foreign Ministers' Conference decided to continue issuing instructions on the draft treaty with Austria, and the undersecretaries are scheduled to meet in London on January 14 next year to hold preliminary discussions on the peace treaties with Germany and Austria.</p>

<h3>The Powder Keg of the Future World War is in the East; Mrs. Pandit Expresses Deep Regret That India Did Not Obtain a Seat on the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Mrs. Pandit (the sister of Nehru), the Indian representative to the General Assembly, told the press here today that the Third World War will be in the East. She stated: "I know that there will be no war in the West for a long time. If there is a war, it will be in the East. Conflicts are inevitable if any form of racial discrimination is implemented and colonial countries continue to hold on to their territories. If there is a dispute in the East, India will be at the center." Mrs. Pandit has requested that India obtain a seat on the Security Council but was opposed by the United States and others, and therefore criticized them. She stated, "I do not know where the US State Department and the people have lost contact, but there must be cracks in some places. The US representative prohibited India from obtaining a seat on the Security Council, which is an example of this. Other countries have also voted against India. Frankly speaking, I do not know what the goals of US foreign policy are." Mrs. Pandit will depart for India on the 13th.</p>

(6) The military forces maintained by member states of the United Nations domestically should also be reduced according to a progressive percentage, and all navies of all countries should be handled in the same way.</p>

<h3>French Political Circles Extremely Busy, Blum Undertakes to Form Cabinet, New Cabinet Members Expected to be Announced Within Days, Washington Welcomes New French Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Paris, 13th, broadcast.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Indian Issue, Churchill Criticizes Government, Says Indian Civil War Almost Inevitable, Dark Future, Nehru to Meet with Gandhi to Discuss</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Former Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today, predicting that a civil war will occur in India, and said that thousands of people have lost their lives in Indian civil unrest, for which the Labour government should be responsible. Minister of Commerce Cripps said that only if India fully complies with the British plan, so that opposing political and religious beliefs can be integrated into a unified government, can the tragedy of civil war be prevented. Churchill also said that Cripps' efforts for Indian independence have had a great misfortune. He then recounted the terror of civil war, concluding that whether for good or bad, this responsibility should be borne by the government. Churchill believes that the unity of India is superficial, entirely due to the rule of British generals. The government's delegation of the power to organize an Indian interim government to the Congress Party led by Nehru, dominated by Hindus, was a big mistake. If the Hindus are allowed to rule the country by virtue of their large number of people, it will inevitably cause civil war, and before the civil war has any results, it will greatly reduce the Indian population, which is frightening. Cripps then stood up to answer Churchill, saying; the government wants to hand over the ruling power to the Indian government and prevent internal strife, which is very difficult, and the biggest difficulty is that Hindus and Muslims have not expressed their readiness to trust each other. The separation of factions in India is indeed a legacy, and the Muslims want to decentralize the power of the central government in order to largely realize their dream of partition, that is, to build another Muslim country, while the Congress Party wants to establish a strong central government. However, I do not want the House of Commons to have the impression that the situation is hopeless. Muslim League leader Jinnah remained in London after attending last week's meeting, and sat in the gallery today with his chin in his hand, listening quietly to the debate. Next to him was Mrs. Pandit, the sister of Nehru, the chief Indian representative to the United Nations General Assembly, with a curtain separating the two representatives of different political and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 13th, broadcast: The British House of Commons ended the debate on the Indian issue after two days, passing a resolution calling on Indians to resolve disputes peacefully. Alexander also refuted in the meeting the opposition's claim that the British representatives' mission in India failed. It is said that the British mediation plan has won the support of the majority of Indians.</p>
<p>Also reported: According to Cripps, 10,267 people have died and countless people have been injured since the Indian civil unrest.</p>
<p>Also reported: Nehru gave a speech in the Indian Constituent Assembly today, emphasizing that India must obtain independence, hoping that the British side will treat Indians with goodwill, and not resort to oppressive means, and expressed his willingness to continue to cooperate with the British side.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 11th, special dispatch] While the Constituent Assembly is in progress, it is reported that Nehru will go to the Bengal provincial headquarters to meet with Gandhi, and discuss the recent British statement with Gandhi to determine the future policies of the Congress Party.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Ship in Distress, United States Sends Personnel to Rescue</h3>

<h3>Director Wu Convenes All Sectors to Discuss Year-End Bonuses, Redetermines Four Principles, Stipulates January as the Standard but Maintains Flexibility, and Hopes for the Widespread Establishment of Factory Councils</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the China Industrial Association, and other organizations to a discussion meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on the year-end bonus issue. The attendees included Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Department, and Xu Jizhu, Shui Xiangyun, Shou Jingwei, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, Ge Jechen, Zhang Zhusan, Liang Yongzhang, Fang Rusheng, Wu Chixian, Ye Xiang _, Wang Xianqing, Gui Fuxing, and others. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also arrived at around 6:00 PM. Director Wu Kaixian served as the chairman and said that the absence of labor disputes in the past few months is the reason why industry and commerce have been able to barely maintain. If the year-end bonus issue cannot be resolved as soon as possible, it will be the seed of labor disputes. I raised this point at the Municipal Government meeting a month ago, and Mayor Wu deeply agreed and ordered that measures be drafted for submission to the Central Government. At the joint meeting of the Municipal Government, after detailed discussion by all parties, the principles for handling the year-end bonus issue have been decided as follows: (1) The business situation of each manufacturer this year will be used as the standard for the year-end bonus. In other words, not the industry as a unit, but each factory and each business firm as the object. (2) Manufacturers with profits will issue a one-month year-end bonus according to last year's example, but it is stipulated that workers who have been in service for a full year can get a one-month year-end bonus. Those who have not completed one year will be calculated proportionally, but the minimum cannot be lower than one-twelfth of a month. (3) Manufacturers without profits will reduce the year-end bonus according to the standard of one month. The labor and management will directly negotiate according to their ability to bear. If no agreement can be reached, the Social Affairs Bureau will make a ruling. If necessary, an accountant can be invited to assist. (4) Some manufacturers have suffered great losses, and the owners have no intention of operating. All are forced to maintain compliance with government orders and do not give year-end bonuses. If there is a surplus in the future, it will be issued from a rich source.</p>
<p>After Director Wu reported, he asked the attending representatives to express their opinions as much as possible, so that the year-end bonus method would be more perfect and effectively implemented.</p>
<h3>The General Labor Union Hopes That Manufacturers Will Establish Labor-Management Symposiums</h3>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, first stood up to speak, believing that the decision principles of the Municipal Government Joint Meeting were very fair, and the Labor Union was willing to support them. There are many labor disputes currently brewing. It is hoped that manufacturers can establish a labor-management symposium to communicate the opinions of both labor and management and eliminate labor disputes in the bud. Workers also have a conscience and will never force the factory to go bankrupt with year-end bonuses, and it is also hoped that the capital side will not deceive the workers. "The two sides will help each other in the same boat" to get through this difficult time. Recently, the National Products Company borrowed 200 million yuan to distribute to employees in the name of medical expenses. When the employees received it, they were greatly moved and automatically canceled the Sunday afternoon holiday to serve the company. The recent business income has greatly increased.</p>
<h3>Hu Boxiang of the Industrial Association Points Out That the Meaning of Surplus Should Be Determined</h3>
<p>Hu Boxiang, the representative of the China Industrial Association, then spoke, pointing out that the year-end bonus is determined according to the profit and loss situation, and there should be a clear stipulation on the interpretation of surplus. Today, in the factory, there is often a situation where the books show a profit, but the inventory is reduced, which is actually a loss. Can this situation be considered a surplus? If the factory does not issue a year-end bonus this year due to losses, it is allowed to issue it from a rich source when there is a surplus, which is equivalent to signing a treaty, which does not seem to be a good strategy. Regarding the latter point, Director Wu explained at the time that this is a gentleman's agreement and not a condition. Hu finally stated: He supports the principles, but should be cautious when implementing them.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Year-End Bonuses for Temporary Workers, Director Zhao Gives an Explanation</h3>
<p>Tian Heqing, the representative of the Industrial Association, supplemented Hu's opinion, advocating that the surplus section can be individually reviewed by the industry association to determine the profit and loss of each manufacturer, and to determine the year-end bonus distribution method and report it to the Social Affairs Bureau, while notifying the Labor Union. This method is more appropriate than the Social Affairs Bureau asking an accountant to check the accounts. Because there are technical difficulties in checking accounts, and it is delayed for a long time, the year-end bonus will lose its timeliness. Tian also asked to discuss whether temporary workers should have year-end bonuses. Director Zhao Banfu immediately stated at the time: According to the factory law, workers who have served for three months are considered long-term workers. But I know for sure that there is a part of silk factories whose employment contracts are ordered every two months, so that the workers will always be temporary workers. Obviously, the capital side intends to take advantage of this and deprive the workers of their due rights, so there should be a fair handling of the year-end bonus issue for temporary workers.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Proposes a Double Salary System, One Month's Salary as the Standard</h3>
<p>At this point, Xu Jizhu, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, said: I have been engaged in the business community for many years. I have always advocated the principle of "good treatment, high efficiency" for the Sichuan people. Therefore, on this issue, I do not advocate using the name of year-end bonus, but I agree to adopt the method of double salary. Manufacturers with profits and no losses will pay one month's salary more. The workers should understand that those who really lose money do not issue year-end bonuses. This principle can avoid the trouble of an accountant checking the accounts, and the year-end bonus issue can be resolved in a short period of time. At the same time, I hope that the Labor Union can also make more efforts in this regard.</p>
<h3>Labor Union Representatives Raised Different Opinions, Rigid Regulations Are Unreasonable</h3>
<p>After Xu finished speaking, a representative of the Cotton Textile Industry of the General Labor Union immediately raised a strong objection to the principle of limiting the year-end bonus to one month. He said that the special profitability of the cotton textile industry is a matter of common knowledge, so the year-end bonus method advocates handling it according to precedent. If you must limit it to one month, the remaining profits should be returned to the country, which is reasonable. Moreover, cotton textile workers managed 50 wooden tubes per person during the enemy and puppet period, and now they manage 200 wooden tubes per person. The workload has increased three times. If the bonus does not increase but decreases, it will be difficult to maintain the production quantity. At this point, another Labor Union representative added that some manufacturers pay very low wages to workers on weekdays, relying entirely on the year-end bonus. The current rigid regulations limiting it to one month will be used by them to exploit the workers. It is also unreasonable not to issue year-end bonuses for piece work. For example, female workers in cigarette factories are all piece work.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Can Negotiate Directly, Which is Easier to Reach an Agreement</h3>
<p>At this time, the representatives of the General Labor Union of the Cotton Textile Industry and the Tobacco Industry respectively elaborated on the generous year-end bonuses of the two industries in the past. The representative of the Cotton Textile Industry also estimated that if the year-end bonus is limited to one month, those who are allocated 20% will take 40 days less of the salary bonus, those with 25% will take two months less of the bonus, and those with 30% will take two and a half months less of the bonus. This kind of huge profit is enjoyed by the capital side, and the real heart is unwilling. At this point, several representatives of the General Labor Union agreed that the year-end bonus should not be rigidly stipulated. Manufacturers with huge profits should issue more, otherwise it will make the workers feel bad and production will inevitably decline. It is best to have representatives from both labor and management openly and honestly directly negotiate, which should be easier to reach an agreement. Piece work should also be given a year-end bonus, because female workers in the overshoe industry and the cigarette industry are all piece work and are highly efficient. This working system cannot be overthrown due to the year-end bonus issue. Of course, the so-called "piece work" refers to piece work done in the factory, and those working outside the factory are not in this case.</p>
<h3>Industries with High Profits Should Increase Public Accumulation Funds</h3>
<p>At this time, Shou Jingwei provided his opinion from a neutral standpoint, saying: I advocate that the name of the year-end bonus should be changed to "year-end bonus", so that it has the meaning of rewarding hard work. Industries with high profits, such as today's cotton textile industry, should increase public accumulation funds to strengthen the foundation of the business. The labor and management of our country need to increase the opportunity to contact each other in order to communicate ideas and eliminate misunderstandings. Shou emphasized the fundamental solution, stressing that the government must reform the financial and economic policies to save the crisis of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Fang Xikong Expresses His Opinion and Proposes Six Measures for Year-End Bonuses</h3>
<p>After the representatives generally expressed their opinions, the chairman invited Chairman Fang Xikong to give a speech. Fang made proposals on the year-end bonus issue item by item: (1) The year-end bonus is limited to one month. (2) The industry association and the Labor Union should first negotiate. If there is a dispute, they should submit it to the government agency for ruling. (3) For a small number of manufacturers with considerable profits, their year-end bonuses can also be negotiated first by representatives of labor and management. If there are difficulties, the government will raise the year-end bonus to seek its balance. (4) It is hoped that each industry will complete the above method within a week and do not delay it, so as not to change. (5) The year-end bonus should be changed to a bonus to imply the equality of labor and management. (6) It is best to give bonuses to workers with special achievements and reduce bonuses to those who deliberately disrupt.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Summarizes Opinions and Decides that the Bonus Has Flexibility</h3>
<p>The meeting had passed 7 o'clock at this time. Director Wu summarized the opinions of the representatives and made the following decisions: (1) "Year-end bonus" is renamed "year-end incentive bonus". (2) The incentive bonus is based on one month's salary, but needs to be flexible. (3) Once the bonus is determined, the capital side should pay it quickly to avoid the drop in currency value. (4) The bonuses for piece workers and temporary workers shall be handled in accordance with the previous year's precedent of each manufacturer (temporary workers who have been in service for three months are considered long-term workers). If there is a dispute over the year-end bonus, it must be handled in accordance with the legal procedures, and neither party shall take free action, otherwise it will be strictly enforced by law.</p>
<p>At this point, Director Wu emphasized the benefits and importance of the "Factory Council", hoping that the factory will widely establish this kind of conference and exert its true effect. Shui Xiangyun pointed out that the establishment of the factory council system is just a formality, mainly because the capital side's behavior of buying US dollars for hoarding is too much, and they dare not make the accounts public. A representative said that the lack of understanding between labor and management is indeed the reason for this. Wu emphasized that the factory council is a bridge between labor and management. The factory can select talents and train cadres, and this meeting has no right to interfere with administration, so there is no need to be afraid of opening it. Wu also believed that the Soviet Union's "Labor Hero" model worker system is worthy of being adopted by China's industrial circles.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Budget for the 26th Year, Various Bureau Meetings Are Rushing to Produce Again</h3>
<p>Adhering to the Principle of Not Exceeding Fixed Tax Revenue</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The preparation of the Shanghai Municipal Government budget for the 36th year has become the central work of the Municipal Government recently. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the total budget submitted by the various bureaus and offices in the Municipal Government's budget meeting reached 500 billion yuan, which is 300 billion yuan more than the possible income of 200 billion yuan of the Finance Bureau. Mayor Wu immediately ordered his subordinates to re-control the system, with the principle of tightening as much as possible, and discussed it again at yesterday's Municipal Government meeting. It is said that the total amount of the second budget of the various bureaus and offices still greatly exceeded the fixed tax revenue of the city. After a heated discussion at yesterday morning's municipal meeting for two hours, it was decided that the Municipal Government's budget must be based on income and expenditure. According to the possible income of 230,893,981,215 yuan in the 36th year, the budgeted expenditure budget of the various bureaus and offices must find ways to ensure that its total does not exceed this number, and it is limited to before the 16th, the Accounting Office will send it to the Accounting Office for joint review and approval, and then submit it to the meeting for discussion. It is said that the various bureaus of the Municipal Government held emergency meetings in the afternoon yesterday to rush to produce the expenditure budget for next year again.</p>
<h3>Discovery of an Illegally Established Radio Station in Zhabei; Investigation Reveals No Political Activity; Male and Female Perpetrators Handed Over to the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>In order to prevent traitors from using radio waves to transmit intelligence and undermine national defense construction, the Ministry of National Defense has specifically ordered all provincial and municipal public security agencies and the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to strictly crack down on such activities. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, upon receiving the order, immediately utilized special equipment to closely detect secret radio stations. Recently, while measuring space radio waves with a radio wave measuring device, the Headquarters discovered abnormal radio waves in the Zhabei area north of the city. They then used a mobile, small-scale wave measuring device to investigate based on the direction of the radio waves, and learned that this secret radio station was located at No. 75 Shuidaidian Road, Zhabei. They immediately dispatched personnel to raid the location and seized a medium-sized transmitter and two radio operators, Wu Xuesi and Xu Ping, who were working at the time. They were immediately taken back to the Headquarters for strict interrogation, which revealed that An Shitang, who resided at the same address, had funded the establishment of the radio station, and that the equipment belonged to Dong Zhibin, an employee of a certain organization in Suzhou. The Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to arrest An Shitang, but Dong Zhibin had already fled upon hearing the news. According to An's confession, they established the radio station for profit, charging 150 yuan per word for commercial telegrams, which were sent to Haimen, Xuzhou, Suzhou, and Guangzhou. The recipient location was a female employee of the Dayun Transportation Company, Lu Maozhu, at No. 666 Fuzhou Road, who was running the business. Lu was immediately arrested at the address, and her testimony matched An Shitang's. After further investigation of the seized evidence, it was confirmed that there was no political activity involved, and the offense was a violation of the Telecommunications Control Regulations promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Communications. In addition to confiscating the transmitter according to regulations, the original case file was transferred to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for handling. The Bureau Director, Yu Bingjian, immediately reported to the Ministry of Communications for instructions on how to handle the matter. The Ministry instructed that they must be severely punished according to the law, and therefore the involved individuals were handed over to the District Procuratorate. The staff of the Garrison Headquarters worked day and night to detect and investigate secret radio stations, and their dedication is truly admirable. Therefore, yesterday, 3 million legal tender was allocated as a bonus.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Plans to Establish Sino-American Air Route; Plans to Cooperate with American Airlines First</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the official signing of the Sino-American Aviation Agreement, various American airlines will soon begin flying to China. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining large aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines, they are currently unable to fly long distances for the time being. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) previously ordered four C-54 aircraft from the United States, but due to frequent worker strikes in American aircraft factories, these aircraft will not arrive in China until the end of next year at the earliest. Before the arrival of its own aircraft, CNAC plans to cooperate with Northwest Airlines of the United States, but this can only be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Communications. If approved, Northwest Airlines will be responsible for the Sino-American route from the United States to Manila, and CNAC will be responsible for the section from Manila to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Abolition of the Slaughter Tax Collection Office</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Finance Bureau considered the situation of the slaughter tax in Shanghai to be extremely complex. Upon initial takeover, in order to facilitate centralized management, it specially established the Slaughter Tax Collection Office to be solely responsible for its duties. After the Office's active reorganization, tax revenues increased every month. Now, the Finance Bureau believes that the slaughter tax has entered a regularized state, and in order to unify tax administration, it has decided to abolish the Office. Its business will be handled separately by the tax collection offices in each district, with the handover scheduled for the 16th of this month. It is also reported that the Finance Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of the tax collection offices in each district and the head of the Slaughter Tax Collection Office the day before yesterday (the 12th) to discuss the handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Pawn Clothes Leads to Shooting and Injury; Two Police Officers Injured in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At about 9:30 last night, a customer suddenly arrived at the Yongda Pawnshop at No. 35 Xinmin Road, Hongkou. He resembled a soldier, with a shaved head, wearing a military uniform under a black coat. He pointed to the coat and said to the shop assistant that he wanted to pawn it. At that time, two shop assistants were in the shop, one named Song Jifang, 25 years old, was washing his feet, and another named Shang Ling (20 years old, from Anhui Province) was sitting on a high stool at the counter. Shang casually told him that military uniforms could not be pawned. Unexpectedly, without asking for a reason, the man took out a pistol and fired a shot at Song, hitting his left temple, causing blood to flow profusely. Brain matter splattered, and the injured man fell back on the chair. The shooter immediately fled out the door. People in the shop shouted loudly. Soon, three or four security team policemen arrived at the scene after hearing the shouts. After asking a few questions, they turned around and went out to pursue the shooter, but were unsuccessful. At the same time, the Hongkou Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched Inspector Yin and policemen Ma Guiliang and Hu Genbao to investigate. They immediately called an ambulance to rush the injured man to the Public Hospital for emergency treatment. On the way, the policemen were hit by a tram at the intersection of Bazilu and Sichuan Road, causing Police Chief Ma Guiliang to be concussed and bleed from his left temple, and Policeman Hu Genbao to injure his left knee. According to investigations by reporters, the injured shop assistant, Song Shangling, has little hope of survival.</p>
<h3>Textbook Piracy Case; Court Postpones Retrial</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wu Bingchang, the legal representative of the Joint Office of National Primary and Secondary School Teaching Materials, sued Zhu Wenxiang of Wanyou Bookstore for infringing copyright by reprinting teaching materials. Yesterday, the court held a hearing. Judge Zhu Yuhuang stated that because the first defendant, Zhu Wenxiang, had also been prosecuted by the District Procuratorate, he needed to review the prosecution case file before deciding whether to accept the private prosecution or the public prosecution. Therefore, although Zhu Wenxiang was currently in custody, he was not brought in for questioning yesterday. Only the second defendant, Lu Xiancheng of Guomin Printing Bureau, the third defendant, Wang Jisheng of Shengji Printing House, the fourth defendant, Lu Jinrong of Tuhai Xingye Printing House, and the fifth defendant, He Zongliang of Juji Binding Workshop, were summoned. This was because all five defendants were suspected of assisting or being entrusted by Zhu Wenxiang to reprint 290,000 copies of national primary and secondary school teaching materials. Judge Zhu stated that the trial procedure was still pending decision, and ordered the case to be retried on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Convenes Coal Briquette Merchants to Form Coal Price Review Committee; Allocates 4,000 Tons of Manufacturing Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Social Bureau convened the Coal Briquette Merchants Association, the Coal Industry Association, and representatives of coal briquette retailers for a discussion at the Social Bureau. It was resolved that the Social Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Coal Industry Association, the Coal Briquette Industry Association, and coal briquette retailers would jointly form a Coal Price Review Committee, and that the first meeting would be held on the 17th. Regarding coal briquette raw materials, the Fuel Management Committee will allocate 4,000 tons for manufacturing. The selling price issue will first be determined by each manufacturer calculating costs and submitting them to the next meeting. Finally, the scope of sales between manufacturers and retailers will also be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Shinsin Company Employees Implement "Lazy Work"</h3>
<p>Employees of the Shinsin Company began a "strike" at around 4:00 PM on the 12th due to a request for year-end bonuses. The employees believe that the cost of living is rising day by day, and their income is insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, they requested that the half-year bonus (one month's salary), which has been in place for 21 years, be issued as usual. The management, however, stated that business was sluggish and losses were accumulating. Therefore, the labor and management sides insisted on their respective positions, and yesterday they were still in a state of "lazy work". The walls and counters were covered with slogans such as "Today, according to government orders, we neither strike nor slack off" and "Please customers take the trouble to purchase goods elsewhere."</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Related parties stated that in this labor dispute at Shinsin Company, the employees demanded that the person in charge respond within a very short period after making their request. When the person in charge said that the conditions needed to be approved by the board of directors, they demanded that he guarantee that the board of directors would definitely approve the labor's conditions, which was clearly unreasonable. Moreover, without the permission of the Social Bureau, they implemented a disguised strike, which is illegal in terms of legal procedures, regardless of whether their demands are reasonable. It was heard that the workers' representatives even stated at the Social Bureau that they could resolve the matter themselves and did not need the Bureau's mediation, which was an attempt to threaten the management with free action. The Social Bureau has now ordered them to immediately restore normal operations and then negotiate. According to a responsible person from the General Labor Union, the labor-management relationship at Shinsin Company has always been relatively good. In the past, when the company had financial difficulties, the labor side accepted the method of paying 70% of their salaries. When salaries could not be paid, the company used gift certificates instead. The "bonus salary" has a history of 21 years, and the management's sudden cancellation of it has caused the labor dispute.</p>
<h3>Collusion from Inside and Outside; Traffic Police Collude with Postal Workers; Shanghai Bank Robbed; 30 Million Stolen During Closing; Employees in the Vault Shouted for Help; North Railway Station Identifies the Perpetrator; Accomplice Arrested in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At 7:30 PM the night before last, four robbers wearing uniforms suddenly entered the Tilamqiao branch of Shanghai Bank at No. 1144 Daming Road through the back door while the bank was closing accounts. One of the robbers, with his face blackened, raised a pistol and ordered all personnel inside the bank to raise their hands. Then, they drove them to a corner, tied up the bank employees one by one with leggings, and took the safe key from the pocket of the bank's accounting director, Wu Yufu. They opened the vault door and stole 30 million in cash and four gold rings. Then, they locked the employees inside the vault, closed the vault door, and the robbers escaped through the back door. When the bank employees saw that the robbers were gone, they shouted for help. Passersby heard the shouts and immediately rushed to the Tilamqiao Police Station to report the crime. After receiving the report, the Police Station dispatched Judicial Section Chief Ma and police officers to the scene. They first released the bank employees, but by that time the robbers had already fled far away. Only two hand grenades were found left behind. Fearing that the robbers might leave Shanghai by train, they took two bank employees to the North Railway Station to wait that very night. At about 11:00 PM, they saw two robbers wearing traffic police uniforms and carrying travel bags approaching. The bank employees identified them without error and they were immediately intercepted. A portion of the stolen money was found on the spot. According to their confessions, their names were Luo Bo and Gong Xisheng, and they were taken back to the Police Station. Subsequently, two postal workers, Li Xiguang and Yuan Zemin, who served as inside men, were arrested at the Zhongshan Hotel in Hongkou and the Shanghai Bank branch on North Sichuan Road. It was heard that there was still a traffic policeman at large, who had taken a train back to Suzhou to rejoin his unit. Therefore, the Tilamqiao Police Station prepared a document yesterday and dispatched personnel to Fengqiao Town outside the Suzhou gate to arrest the robber Liu Yucheng. Three gold rings and 3 million in stolen money were found. According to his confession, he is a current messenger for the 11th column of the Traffic Police Team, and he admitted without hesitation to the robbery. He was escorted back to Shanghai last night. Another accomplice who is still at large is being vigorously pursued. It was learned afterwards that the four robbers were all policemen from the 4th battalion of the 11th column of the Traffic Police General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<h3>Three New Hospitals Established in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Health Bureau, noting the severe shortage of hospitals in the city's suburbs and the extreme difficulty for villagers to seek medical treatment, has decided to establish three small suburban hospitals in Gaoqiao, Caohejing, and Zhabei.

<h3>1.5 Million Tons of UNRRA Relief Supplies; UNRRA Plans to Ship 300 Ocean Liners to Shanghai Next Spring; Mostly Food, Machinery, and Materials</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to UNRRA sources, after the resolution of the U.S. maritime workers' strike, 83 ocean liners will soon transport supplies to China. Some of these are currently being loaded, while others are already en route. The first two ships to depart are the "Protector" and the "De Lin Maxke." The former is carrying 260 tons of cargo, and the latter is carrying 560 tons, including diesel engines, water pumps, electric welders, sewing machines, and fishing equipment.</p>
<p>UNRRA hopes to have 300 ocean liners to transport all 1.5 million tons of relief supplies. However, the exact number of ships needed will depend on loading conditions, ship size, and the number of ships specifically carrying relief supplies. The main supplies carried by these ships are food, including American flour, Siamese white rice, and South American soybeans. The next is industrial equipment, including machinery, railway tracks, locomotives, and bridges. In addition, there are fishing gear and clothing for the restoration of China's fishing industry.</p>
<p>The arrival date of the ships in Shanghai will be around January or February next spring, but this mainly depends on the condition of the city's port and warehouses. UNRRA is now able to free up some warehouse space on a weekly basis. The speed at which China transports the supplies inland will determine how soon the ships will arrive in Shanghai. The congestion in the city has now been eliminated, and the wharves and warehouses have been greatly improved. UNRRA and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) also have many tractors, barges, cranes, and other tools, so it is believed that even if a large number of ships arrive, unloading will be very rapid. UNRRA and CNRRA authorities are closely monitoring the port situation to prevent congestion from recurring and will telegraph instructions to the ships en route.</p>
<h3>Temporary Postponement of Demolition of Shantytowns Due to Cold Weather; City Council Asks City Government to Consider the Livelihoods of the Poor</h3>

Fourteen councilors were present, with Feng Youzhen as the chairman. Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau and Liu Shengqu of the Public Utilities Bureau were also present. After the chairman's report, the following proposals were discussed: (1) The Speaker submitted a proposal stating that since the city has entered winter, there have been frequent reports of refugees freezing to death. It is proposed that the council launch a city-wide fundraising campaign to assist with winter relief efforts, and to attach a notice to all citizens of the city. The question is whether this is appropriate. Resolution: Passed. (2) Approve the City Government's response regarding the adjustment of pawnshop interest rates and submit it for discussion. Decision: The period is still set at six months. If there are difficulties in turnover, the Municipal Bank should adjust it. (3) Approve the City Government's response regarding compensation for war losses. The Executive Yuan has approved the extension of the reporting deadline by one month, and the compensation value is a general case and cannot be changed easily. How should this be handled? Resolution: Report to the general meeting. (4) Approve the City Government and Social Affairs Bureau's separate forwarding of the implementation measures for sugar sales per capita in the city. What should be done? Resolution: If it is intended to handle the matter, it should be filed for record and kept on file. (5) Approve the transfer of the revised draft management measures for employee welfare facilities by the Law and Regulations Committee. How should this be handled? Resolution: Passed in accordance with the amendments of the Law and Regulations Committee. (6) At the previous meeting of this committee, Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau restrict the use of electricity. The Public Utilities Bureau should be requested to send personnel to attend and report in detail for reference and research. Now that the Public Utilities Bureau has sent personnel to report, how should this be handled? Resolution: Request the Public Utilities Bureau to actively find ways to open up power sources, while paying attention to the minimum needs of the people and taking into account the needs of handicrafts. There were also two temporary motions: (1) Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan proposed that the City Government be requested to temporarily postpone the demolition of shantytowns in the midst of winter in order to maintain the livelihoods of the city's poor. Should this be decided? Resolution: Passed. (2) For the sake of conveying democratic education to the public and making the contents of the General Assembly clear to all citizens, broadcasting equipment should be installed in the meeting place to broadcast the actual situation of the General Assembly to the city. Is this appropriate for submission to the General Assembly for decision? Resolution: Passed, please have the Speaker and Deputy Speaker verify.</p>
<h3>Senate Appeals for Disaster Relief Victims: Letter to Citizens Urging Donations</h3>
<p>To all citizens of Shanghai: Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been severely cold, and scenes of suffering people are commonly seen in the streets and alleys. They have no food for the night, their clothes do not cover their bodies, they are tormented by hunger, struggle under the frost, their bodies are weak, diseases follow, and news of death is heard daily. Thinking of the disaster victims, how can we not feel deep sympathy? Fortunately, the local authorities in this city are preparing for the winter season and various relief efforts are being actively carried out. However, the disaster victims are scattered and difficult to track, and the relief efforts may not be comprehensive. The scope of assistance should be as broad as possible. Taking the lead in righteousness is something that should not be disturbed. This council sincerely appeals to all sectors of the city, respectfully requesting people from all walks of life to rise up and provide assistance by donating to the Winter Relief Committee of this city. The aim is to ensure that all refugees in the city receive practical benefits and that the rescue work is completed as soon as possible. This council is deeply concerned about the displaced and feels the suffering of those affected. We dare to make an appeal, asking for generous assistance. We do not dare to expect a grand mansion, but even a spoonful of help will be greatly appreciated. Respond to the call and be eager to do good. Seeing righteousness, one should bravely act. With this announcement, we hope for your kind consideration. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Senate.</p>

<h3>Personnel of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRSA) Machinery Factory Suspected of Stealing and Selling Equipment; District Prosecutor's Office Interrogates Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Australian Deputy Director of the ERRSA Zhenru Machinery Factory, Xizhi, colluded with Qian Zhengfu, the Deputy Director of Factory Affairs, and staff members Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, Zhang Wuqing, Li Siheng, Huang Ningbin, Le Gang, and Zhao Bolo, in the middle of last month to steal and sell equipment from the factory, worth as much as 800 million yuan. The matter was reported to the ERRSA headquarters in Nanjing. After receiving the report, the headquarters sent personnel to Shanghai for a secret investigation. It was learned that after coming to Shanghai, Xizhi became acquainted with a Chinese woman and they were deeply fond of each other. Many of the factory staff were introduced through family connections. Some of the above suspects are also considered to be "close relatives." Xizhi usually lived a very extravagant lifestyle, leading to heavy suspicion of theft and sale. The Municipal Police Department was then telegraphed to detain the above-mentioned individuals, who were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

<h3>ERRSA Assists Manufacturers in Ordering Industrial Machinery</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The ERRSA Shanghai branch believes that the ERRSA's work in the future will focus on post-war reconstruction, and the Shanghai branch will give as much assistance as possible to industrial development. However, the branch's task is only to accept and review applications from public utilities and manufacturers for ordering machinery. The final decision rests with the headquarters. The principle of application is to prioritize public utilities, followed by coal mines, machine repair shops, and then building materials. After the application is approved, a deposit of 30% of the price must be paid first. If the goods can be delivered in a short period of time, the payment should be cleared within six months, otherwise, it can be paid within three years, but 30% of the original price must be added as transportation costs. Currently, the supply of goods from American factories is extremely scarce. Domestic manufacturers find it faster to order through ERRSA, so the number of applicants is extremely high.</p>

If the height and construction period of the houses are used as a unit, they are as follows: (1) 18 locations are buildings of two floors or less that are more than 20 years old. (2) Four locations are buildings of two floors or less that are less than 20 years old. (3) 12 locations are buildings of three floors or more that are more than 20 years old.

Doctors say it is bronchitis, some say it is anemia, and others think it is pulmonary tuberculosis. There are different treatments, and I don't know what to do. I have injected calcium iodide, glucose calcium, and anti-tuberculosis, and also take cod liver oil and Halipar pills, etc., but none of them have worked. Recently, the disease has changed slightly. The chest pain is as usual, my appetite is almost gone, and I often have chills and fever. I feel hot and swollen when I get up and lie down. I don't know what disease it is, so I pray for a treatment method.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] Immediately perform an X-ray examination of the lungs to diagnose whether there is pulmonary tuberculosis, test the blood pressure to see if it is too high, and then decide on a treatment method.</p>

<h3>Market Buying is One-Sided; Gold, Stocks, and Foreign Exchange Soar to Unprecedented Heights; Gold Spot Prices Break Records Again; Shanghai Stocks Rise to the Limit After Opening</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, gold prices soared, and the rise was extremely violent. The Central Bank's supply was extremely scarce, and people's hearts were unusually firm. The opening price in the morning was 3,000,800 yuan. After the opening, people still seemed dazed, struggling at the 3 million yuan mark for a while. Once the 3 million yuan mark was stabilized, buyers were extremely excited, the supply was not smooth, and the price rose sharply. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 3,060,000 yuan. Foreign exchange repeatedly assisted buying, and the market became better and better. Near noon, it suddenly soared to 3.2 million yuan. At noon, it hovered around 3.19 million yuan. In the afternoon, next-day delivery soared to over 3.35 million yuan in the chaos. The Central Bank exerted pressure, and many parties sold off urgently, immediately falling back more than 100,000 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day, decorative gold was 340,000 yuan, silver ingots and silver dollars were flat, and dark interest was still around 1 jiao 3 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange was fiercely prosperous. The US dollar started at 5,700 yuan in the early morning and went all the way forward. The buying trend became more and more intense. Once it was searched, there was no supply. At noon, it suddenly soared to about 6,300 yuan. In the afternoon, a high price of 6,500 yuan was seen, but later, as the gold market fell, it also fell back. The buying and selling prices diverged by 200 yuan, and the transaction was extremely chaotic. Finally, it was between 6,300 yuan and 6,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 600 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were extremely high and also rose by 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>Even Tiles Have Their Day; The Shanghai Stock Market is Bustling</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks rose abnormally again yesterday. Some bulls entered after exiting first, and the shorts were squeezed and could not move, almost in a situation of buying without selling. In addition to rising to the limit, there were also buyers willing to buy at today's limit. Each stock had already reported a surge at the opening in the morning. No. 199, No. 233, No. 133, etc. all advanced and then reported a high flight. Some of the selling at high prices included No. 151, No. 177, No. 179, No. 90, No. 145, No. 198, and Guangbang, causing a falling wind, but it did not break the opening line. People's hearts are still stable. No. 38, No. 133, No. 76, No. 12, No. 36, No. 142, No. 160, No. 83, No. 212, and No. 215 were successively purchased. At 10:20, Diyong Yarn once advanced from No. 181 to the limit. Guangbang sold at a high price, No. 44, No. 233 sold current Diyong Yarn, and No. 233, No. 177, No. 141, No. 203, etc. all sold, once falling by more than ten yuan. However, the outside market was buying a lot, and the buying sentiment was still strong. No. 36, No. 46, No. 145, No. 137, No. 16, No. 223, and No. 99 all advanced. Financial gangs such as No. 181 and No. 68 also advanced. In addition, the outside market first reported a limit up, so the current Diyong Yarn also reported a limit up after the cold stocks rose to the limit. Afterwards, the shorts urgently replenished, and the longs vigorously raised the price. Diyong Yarn even rose to over 600 yuan, and Xinhuo also had a transaction at 290 yuan. All stocks except Cement Five Harmony all reported a limit up. In the afternoon, they were still in the limit up. The outside dark market Diyong Yarn once pulled up to 640 yuan, and then quickly returned. Xinhuo traded at 295 yuan. Finally, the price of gold fell sharply, and the longs closed out and fell sharply. Diyong Yarn once fell to 570 yuan, and Xinhuo was 275 yuan. At the close, Diyong Yarn was around 580 yuan, and Xinhuo was around 280 yuan. The outside stocks also reported an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Also Turned Up Yesterday</h3>
<p>Government bonds also trended up yesterday. The Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1,250 yuan, and rose back to 1,430 yuan due to purchases by rooms 503 and 604, and then slightly flattened. As a result, it rose 200 yuan higher than the previous close. Jia and Yi rose 120 yuan, Ding rose 150 yuan, and Tong Wu rose 170 yuan. The transaction was more than 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital is Active Everywhere; Foreign Stocks are Exceptionally Excited</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks trended up again yesterday. Floating capital from all sides was interested in participating, and the stocks were exceptionally enthusiastic. As a result, Yishai and British United each rose by more than 30% compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Steel Industry, Jardine Beer Industry, and Guangbang each rose by more than 20%, and Shipping and Paper each rose by more than 10%.</p>
<h3>Under Gold Price Leadership, Silk Rises in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was again influenced by the rise in gold prices, with all categories blindly following suit. No trading was done for No. 120 rayon, Guangtian Bridge brand. Gaoshan brand opened in the morning at a bid of 300,000 yuan, rising to 520,000 yuan by noon, and the highest bid reached over 700,000 yuan in the afternoon. Later, as gold prices slightly retreated, it also softened, with a bid of 600,000 yuan lacking takers. Dongyang brand was bid at 650,000 yuan, a significant increase of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day. No. 120 brand semi-lustrous was traded in the morning at 3.85 million yuan. No. 75 Golden Rooster semi-lustrous saw transactions at 4.15 million yuan in the morning. No. 100 Snow Pagoda non-lustrous opened at 3.6 million yuan, but there were no transactions in the afternoon. Factory prices were also high, and the market was quite chaotic. Holders were unwilling to sell, resulting in few transactions. The China Silk Corporation did not open yesterday. The Silk Industry Corporation sold 20 to 30 bales at a price of 4.05 million yuan. Due to the high price of raw materials, the factory prices of silk fabrics also increased, with bedspreads up by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, patterned crepe up by 100 yuan, and Hua scarf crepe and feather gauze both up by 100 yuan. Dawei tweed was selling well, and the price was also hot. Sheng Hang and other goods remained relatively stable. Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned higher, as the余鈔 (Yu Chao, likely referring to excess paper money) was repeatedly reported to be soaring. The sluggish yarn market received a shot in the arm, boosting morale. Industry insiders absorbed the念支 (Nian Zhi, likely referring to a brand of yarn) brands earlier, and weaving mills sought 42-count double-strand yarn later, eventually closing at the highest price.念支 brands were up 30,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and 42-count yarn rose by about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Should Improve: Observations on the Dyeing and Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a leading figure in the local dyeing and weaving industry, the government's decision to exchange yarn for cotton will require yarn mills to use American cotton, which must be exchanged for their yarn production, thus making full use of national cotton to avoid exchange restrictions. Therefore, it is expected that the future of national cotton will gradually improve.</p>
<h3>Importers Switch to Export Business</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Import Control Committee in this city, the control of imported goods has gradually become effective. Therefore, local importers are switching to export goods. It is expected that the export business will have a promising future. However, a large supply of production is needed to cope with the demand.</p>
<h3>Generator Malfunction Forces Yarn Mills to Halt Production</h3>
<p>The power company is actively repairing; power generation may be restored today.</p>
<p>Amidst the panic over power shortages, yesterday, all state-owned and private yarn mills in this city were cut off by the power company and forced to stop production. Seventeen factories of the Fangjian Corporation and 34 private yarn mills were cut off at 10:00 AM. The factories reported to the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, which was extremely alarmed, but no one knew the truth about the power outage. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the association, together with Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the Fangjian Corporation, and others, visited Mayor Wu around 4:00 PM and requested Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to jointly inquire about the truth. According to Mayor Wu's report, the Shanghai Power Company had a 12,000-kilowatt generator that malfunctioned the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another 10,000-kilowatt generator suddenly broke down, reducing the total power supply by 30,000 kilowatts. The company had no choice but to temporarily cut off power to all yarn mills in the city. Other power users were not affected. However, the two damaged generators had only minor internal problems, and the power company is rushing to repair them and expects to restore power generation today.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Rebounds with Gold Price; Oilseed Cakes and Grains Also Show Strength</h3>
<p>The rice market received over 16,000 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice from both north and south. The weather turned overcast, and demand from stores increased. With the surge in red gold, morale improved, leading to strong sales and a rebounding market. Northern and southern japonica rice rose in unison by over 1,000 yuan. White阴元 (Yin Yuan, likely referring to a grade of rice) was high, while削次 (Xiao Ci, likely referring to a grade of rice) was stable. Indica rice also followed suit, rising by 1,000 yuan. The oil market echoed the other commodities, stopping its decline and rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Demand remained strong. Flour showed slight strength, while bran remained flat. Soybean exports slowed, and oil mills were selectively purchasing, resulting in a mediocre trend. Broad beans remained unchanged.南洋 (Nanyang, likely referring to Southeast Asia) continued to purchase green beans, with limited supply, leading to another increase of over 1,000 yuan. Red beans were nominally stable but actually firm. Red sorghum saw movement in distilleries due to scarce supply, rebounding by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame continued to be selected for high quality by Cantonese merchants, rising by another 300 to 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw ordinary purchases from Cantonese merchants, resulting in a fluctuating situation. The supply of wheat was very limited, and prices were strong, rising by another 300 to 500 yuan. Soybean cake saw transactions in both Taiwan and oil production, and sellers were firm, with prices rising by 200 to 300 yuan. The future trend will depend on the extent of digestion in other areas.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Answers Reporters' Questions: No News of High-Price Policy; Loans Intended to Promote Factory Production; Improper to Stir Up the Market Opportunistically</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold, US dollar, and stock market in this city continued to climb to new peaks under the continuous stimulation of various rumors. There were reports that the authorities would consider a high-price policy, and that the International Monetary Fund Conference would announce the exchange rates between member countries next Monday, predicting that China's external exchange rate would change. Reporters then visited Mayor Wu to inquire whether the authorities were considering a high-price policy. Mayor Wu said: "I have not heard of it." He also said: "The authorities are handling production loans to facilitate the funding of production enterprises, so as to continue to increase production. When the decision was made, it was also expected that the market might be stimulated. As expected, before the loans were released, speculators stirred up the market and caused trouble, which is very inappropriate."</p>
<p>According to an observer, although the International Monetary Fund Conference is scheduled to announce the exchange rates between member countries next Monday, President Song has previously stated that countries directly affected by the war can postpone the announcement of their external exchange rates. Therefore, it is expected that the news may not be as general as observed in our country. Moreover, the implementation of the revised import and export trade measures is in its initial stage, and it seems unnecessary to adjust the exchange rate again.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Trade Bureau Emphasizes the Export of Special Products</h3>
<p>In the past, the focus of the Taiwan Trade Bureau's business was on supporting production and transportation, supplying important raw materials, and solving the problems of "clothing," "food," "housing," and "transportation" to meet the needs of the people of Taiwan Province. In the future, it will focus on the export of Taiwan's special products such as coal, tea, pineapple, canned goods, fruits, grass mats, and sugar produced by the Bureau itself.</p>
<h3>Hankou Plans to Establish Public Warehouses; Warehouse Receipts Can Be Used as Collateral</h3>
<p>The Hankou Municipal Government plans to establish public warehouses to store industrial and commercial raw materials and finished products. Once the goods are stored in the warehouse, merchants can apply to municipal banks for loans based on the value of the goods to facilitate turnover. After accepting this application, the municipal banks will transfer the mortgage to the National Bank. It is said that this method can reduce the difficulty of industrial and commercial loan procedures and the benefits of flexible use of funds. It is reported that the established principles for establishing warehouses are as follows: (1) The warehouse should make full use of the city's public property and rent vacant warehouses; (2) The warehouses should be divided into upper, middle, and lower sections according to the city's geographical situation to reduce the cost of entry and exit; (3) The cost of warehouse repairs will be paid by the municipal government; (4) Warehouse rent will be classified and determined according to the value and volume of goods, and will be reduced as much as possible to maintain the necessary expenses of the warehouse as a principle; (5) The revenue and expenditure of the warehouse should be balanced to achieve self-sufficiency; (6) The total amount of warehouse profits and losses will be included in the municipal government's annual budget and submitted to the provincial government for approval. It is reported that this method can be implemented after being approved by the city's Second Council.</p>
<h3>New Plan for Handling Black Market Cotton Yarn; Under Review by President Song; Preliminary Agreement Reached at Group Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Guild convened a nine-member group meeting again yesterday morning from 11:00 AM. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the association, and several executive directors also attended. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged on the new principles for handling cotton yarn. It was heard that several representatives at the meeting could not fully agree on the concentration of guild applications and distribution. The discussion lasted until about 3:00 PM before the meeting adjourned. It was heard that a preliminary agreement has been reached on the final application and distribution point.</p>
<p>According to Wu, the concurrent chairman of the Cotton Management Committee, the new plan for handling cotton yarn is currently under review by President Song. Once the approval is received, the Cotton Management Committee can convene a meeting to discuss implementation.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Still Not Reviving</h3>
<p>The domestic sales of black and green tea have still not revived. In the foreign tea market, English merchants are still holding onto high-end old Keemun tea, making transactions sluggish. Other teas, such as 抽珍 (Chou Zhen, likely referring to a grade of tea) and 珍眉 (Zhen Mei, likely referring to a grade of tea) of inferior quality, are difficult to sell continuously. Although this year's new tea suits the taste, the price is surprisingly high, and merchants are afraid to touch it. Therefore, the process is clear. However, since Wenchang Tea Company resumed the handling of Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei (New Zhenmei) tea, it is still being dragged in, and the situation is very stable. According to industry insiders, the low-grade green tea, such as Gongxi and Gongzhu, that used to be sold to India has been self-sufficient since the country strived to produce it itself. However, there is still a need for high-end varieties, but the lack of shipping makes it difficult to fulfill.</p>
<h3>Barter Trade; More Tung Oil and Bristles; Tea Sales Sluggish and Procurement Becomes a Problem</h3>
<p>The Sino-Soviet barter trade handled by the Central Trust Bureau will take several more years to complete due to poor transportation and difficulty in determining prices, and will not be completed until 1952. The Sino-Soviet barter trade work this year will end soon, and the specified barter value has also been fulfilled. The total barter value this year is 11 million US dollars, all of which are agricultural products, including tung oil, bristles, tea, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-French barter trade, the Central Trust Bureau has also received several calls from French merchants to purchase tea, but the price could not be agreed upon, so the tea handled by the Central Trust Bureau was not exported. There have been sporadic automatic sales by tea merchants, but they are very few and are only exploratory in nature.</p>
<p>According to another source, tea merchants, hopeless about tea exports, are asking the government to purchase tea at reasonable prices. The government is unwilling to freeze a portion of funds due to stagnant tea sales. However, remedial measures are still under discussion, and it is feared that there will be no concrete measures this year.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Revises Method for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes</h3>
<p>The Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has noted that there are a large number of damaged banknotes and unneeded small denominations held by merchants and residents in various places. To facilitate the exchange for citizens, it has notified all branches and offices to earnestly redeem damaged banknotes and small denominations according to the revised method for exchanging damaged banknotes. (1) For slightly damaged banknotes, where the remaining portion is more than three-quarters, even if they have been split but can be matched, or are stained and charred, but the signatures, numbers, words, patterns, etc. are all recognizable, they will be redeemed at full value. (2) For stained banknotes where the remaining portion is less than three-quarters, they will be redeemed at half the value. (3) As for those that have been smoked by fire, immersed in water, stained with oil, or dyed, making it impossible to identify the authenticity, or the remaining portion is less than one-third, or cannot be matched when pieced together, (4) those that have been deliberately cut, dug, tampered with, or had one side removed, or unusable yarn tickets, such as sample tickets and canceled tickets, will not be redeemed. However, in special circumstances, if the remaining portion does not meet the requirements of this method, but the person can prove the facts and the supervisors of the four banks believe that it can be accommodated, it can be redeemed at their discretion. However, the damaged banknote must be signed and certified by the supervisors of the four banks.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Fuel Meeting; Decides to Organize Fuel Price Review Committee; Sets Up Bituminous Coal Ball Group to Review Prices Next Time</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau convened relevant parties yesterday to review the methods for factory coal and rationed coal balls due to the surge in fuel prices in this city and the difficulty for citizens to purchase. Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Economic Administration Office, Wu, the director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Lu Houlian of the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, Luo Xiongqin of the Coal Business Association, and Wu Yanling, a representative of coal ball retailers, and more than ten other people attended. Five points were discussed: (1) The problem of unblocking the source. The Fuel Management Committee's supply of coal in this city was 4,081 tons in July, 5,058 tons in August, 10,427 tons in September, 13,540 tons in October, and 10,580 tons in November. The rationed price has been maintained since June. Recently, due to the increased allocation price of public utilities, a black market has been triggered. At present, the demand for coal for factories and coal balls for citizens has not increased, but the supply has increased proportionally. The reason is that manufacturers believe that the Fuel Management Committee cannot always maintain the price of coal unchanged. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to unblock the source. The Fuel Management Committee has decided to plan as a whole. This month, 4,000 tons of white coal (2,000 tons of which are semi-bituminous coal) have been shipped in, and it is planned that the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association will formulate the distribution method. 14,095 tons of bituminous coal are planned to be distributed to factories by the Coal Business Association. (2) The previous fixed proportional distribution method for coal allocation was not satisfactory. Starting this month, the quota will be determined based on the size of the factory's business scope and the amount of electricity used, which was passed at the next meeting. (3) The inspection of the composition of coal balls will be supervised by the Social Affairs Bureau and retailers. (4) The problem of coal ball allocation will be drafted by the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association based on the size of the retail store. However, the original stores of the coal ball factory will continue to exist. (5) The problem of coal ball prices is closely related to supervision and manufacturing. The amount of raw materials used by the coal ball factory will determine the amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee, which will be advanced from the coal business. The proportion of this combination will be used as the standard for setting the price. (6) In order to stabilize coal prices in the future, the Shanghai Coal Price Review Committee will be organized, consisting of seven units: the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, the Coal Business Association, and retailers. Two groups will be set up under the committee: the bituminous coal group to handle coal for factories, and the coal ball group, and the price will be reviewed next time.</p>
<h3>Newly Extracted Green Sugar Opened; Goods Can Be Delivered Next Monday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tight due to the shortage of Chaoqing sugar. The recently arrived 300-odd packages of newly extracted green sugar opened at 100,300 yuan yesterday, and the goods can be delivered next Monday. Xinghua Gang opened with Tribute Powder White at 132,300 yuan to 130,000 yuan, followed by 128,000 yuan, Xinghua Red High at 123,000 yuan, and Juezhi at 118,900 yuan. Jian Gang Diaogreen opened up to 100,000 yuan. The association's current market price for white refined sugar is 135,000 yuan, with 3,500 yuan less for the next grade, and 116,000 yuan for raw red sand.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Development of Hong Kong Banking Industry</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong industrial and commercial industry is in a slump, but the number of newly opened banks here is increasing every month. Due to the increasing number of newly established banks, each bank is competing for business and has raised the interest rate on deposits to as high as 4%. In terms of remittances, they are also striving for speed and have reduced the remittance rate to 5%, which is equal to the lending rate. It is heard that some banks, due to poor business, have changed their funds to engage in speculation, which is extremely risky.</p>
<h3>American Merchants Hope to Ship National Goods to the United States for Sale</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Mr. Harvan, the Far East manager of Macy's Company (the world's largest department store), Americans are more concerned about the "Made in China" label after the war than ever before. He hopes that our national products can take advantage of this period to ship to the United States for sale in large quantities at reasonable prices, otherwise other Far Eastern countries will take their place. For example, goods similar to Chinese styles from India and South America are currently being shipped to the United States for sale. He hopes that Chinese producers and exporters will have a long-term vision and try to reduce profits in order to stimulate trade. If goods are not sold during this transitional period, it may lead to dangerous consequences, causing buyers and consumers of Chinese national products to turn to products from other countries.</p>
<h3>Merchants Hope to Relax the Deadline for Pledging Export Materials</h3>
<p>The China Import and Export Trade Association, in order to facilitate the turnover of funds for export materials for the industry, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to transfer the business to the Four Banks Joint Office. The Four Banks Joint Office then transferred the request to the Central Bank to formulate a method for lending, re-pledging, and re-discounting export materials, which was approved and notified to various banks and offices for handling. However, the association only received the telegram notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 11th, and has notified the colleagues in the industry. According to a spokesperson for the association, transportation has not fully recovered since the restoration, and inland transportation is quite difficult. According to reports from colleagues recently, it takes as long as two months for goods shipped from Chongqing to Shanghai. Although the government and banks are doing their best to encourage exports and fully supply funds, the third point of the original method stipulates that "the original pledge shall not exceed 90 days, and for Shanghai re-pledging, Chongqing shall not exceed 30 days, Yichang, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shashi shall not exceed 25 days, and other places shall not exceed 20 days," which restricts the export industry and fails to give full play to it. Now, the association is requesting the transportation authorities to allocate ships to speed up transportation, and is encouraging colleagues to actively increase exports in accordance with the government's intentions. At the same time, it plans to request the national banks to appropriately relax the deadline in order to encourage exports and achieve practical results.</p>

<h3>League A Football League: Youyou Meets the Jews Again: Whether Today's Game Can Be Played Depends on the Weather</h3>

<h3>Guanzhong is Covered with Frost and Snow (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Airmail from Xi'an, Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Every Family With Hanging Willows, Canal Water Green at the Door</p>
<p>"The electricity generated by Longmen can reach 1.2 million kilowatts; this work should be done by the central government. The surrounding irrigation and water conservancy should be handled by the local government." But there are more things to think about than can be done. Shaanxi's water conservancy is still centered on irrigation. Canal water turns the yellow earth banks green, and every family has hanging willows in front of their door. However, the Water Conservancy Bureau doesn't know how much more there is to do. Water conservancy projects should have multiple goals, but now there is only one: irrigation. For the Ba'ou Canal, which has been completed and has started releasing water, the Yongli Bureau has sent more than 400 people to manage it and collect water fees based on acreage. For cotton fields, the fees are divided into three grades, with 1 jin, 1 liang, and 4 liang of cotton collected per mu, converted at 360 yuan per jin. For wheat fields, the fees are divided into three grades, with 5 jin, 12 liang, 3 jin, 12 liang, and 1 jin, 14 liang of wheat collected, converted at 48 yuan per jin. For rice fields, 3 jin, 12 liang of rice are collected, and for newly added paddy fields in southern Shaanxi, 7 jin are collected, converted at 40 yuan per jin. The method for converting water fees for the 34th year was agreed upon this spring. Cotton and wheat prices soared, and the autumn collection reached 290 million yuan, which was not enough for management fees. The Water Conservancy Bureau lost money this year, losing 400 million yuan. "We can't do this next year," Water Conservancy Bureau Director Liu Zhongrui told me. "An average of 3,500 yuan per mu is just over 2 jin of cotton, which is not much. Next year, we can collect 4 billion yuan, which can be used for other things."</p>
<p>Four hundred people are not enough to take on all the management work. There are water elders, ditch chiefs, and canal guards on the canals, nominally assisting the water flow personnel. Each canal has a management bureau, divided into several sections, with one ditch elder per section, in charge of several ditch gates, one ditch chief per ditch gate, in charge of several villages and fortresses, and one canal guard per village or fortress. They are all elected by local farmers and are unpaid, only receiving a small stipend, based on acreage, less than 100 yuan per qing. Ditch chiefs receive twice as much as water elders and canal guards because they are more responsible. The Water Conservancy Bureau told me that the water fee grading system is based on ditch gates: each year, from November 1st to October 30th of the following year, is the irrigation year. At the end of the year, each canal management bureau requests the Water Conservancy Bureau, and then forwards a letter to the Finance Department, with both parties sending personnel to the canal to check the water intake situation for the entire year, to see whether to collect or not, and to consult all the water elders. Then, the water fees are set. If the water elders think it is fair, they sign and stamp separately. As for those who are irrigated less frequently or not irrigated at all, they are all exempt. After the date for collecting is set, the local county governments, in accordance with the collection of grain tax version string method, create strings and distribute them for the landlords to seal and submit to the treasury together with the grain tax.</p>
<p>Currently, the Jinghui, Weihui, Meihui, Heihui, Hanhui, Ganrui, Baohui, and Tonghui canals irrigate 1.3 million mu of land. The Jing and Wei canals were completed before the War of Resistance, the Mei, Hei, and other five canals were completed during the War of Resistance, and the Tonghui Canal was funded by local funds, started after the victory, and completed in May of this year. The irrigation area varies, with the Ganrui Canal being the smallest, at just over 3,000 mu, more than 20 times less than the Jinghui Canal, which irrigates more than 700,000 mu.</p>
<p>The five canals currently under construction can irrigate one million mu of land upon completion. The Fenghui Canal is in Qinduzhen, Wei County, irrigating 230,000 mu of land. Construction began in September of the 30th year, and the water diversion project has been fully repaired. Most of the channels and buildings have been completed, and earthen channels are being repaired. The Xuhui Canal is in Shengxian Village, Chenggu County, irrigating 160,000 mu of land, and construction also began in September of the 30th year, with one-tenth or one-twelfth of the project still incomplete. The Laohui Canal is in Yan County, irrigating 100,000 mu of land. Construction began in the 32nd year, and the river dam and tunnel have been completed, and buildings are being repaired. The Dinghui Canal is in Zhaoshiku, Hengshan, diverting water from the Wuding River to irrigate 40,000 mu of land. Construction began in April of the 30th year, and the equipment was completed long ago. Among the buildings, only the inverted siphon and culvert are missing, and the project is still dragging its tail. Recently, there has been heavy fighting in this area, and all the engineering personnel have fled to Yulin. The Luohui Canal is the largest in the middle, diverting water from the Luo River in Dengcheng to irrigate 500,000 mu of land in Dali, Chaoyi, and Pucheng counties. It was started by Li Yizhi's Jingluo Engineering Bureau, which has been working on the project from the 22nd year of the Republic of China until now. Most of the project has been completed, but the water transmission project is extremely difficult. The channel must pass through an iron ore mountain. The 5th tunnel, 3,000 meters long, passes through a quicksand layer and requires a large amount of money and tools. Recent news has come that the 5th tunnel was finally broken through on the 24th of last month. Ten years of construction is really not easy!</p>
<p>The project cannot be completed, dragging its tail, is said to be for money, but in fact, it is mostly affected by bureaucracy, and there are problems with the system. Which of the book-smart guys engaged in these projects is not full of complaints? Making budget requests, the Executive Yuan approves, the Farmers Bank lends at three years' interest, deducted immediately because it is agricultural loan, the procedure is time-consuming, always calculated by the season or year, but always less than the number, tens of percent less than the budget, resulting in a dragging tail, and then make another budget request, scaring the gentlemen who sit in the office with cigars in their mouths, because it is even more than the total amount requested for the first time. The Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau's Laoxu and Ding canals are all like this: the 35th year also needs construction funds. If a discount is given again when issuing the funds, then another request will be made next year, and a small tail will be dragged on the tail. Last year, the Agricultural Bank lent money, but this year the contract has not been signed. The Water Conservancy Bureau said: It's okay if you don't lend, we'll find another way. It is scheduled to be completed this year, let's see by the end of the year.</p>
<p>If international banks lend to Chinese banks, and these banks use the money to raise interest rates and lend it out, making money in the process, it is a big problem. Unless there is a special tacit understanding, international banks are unwilling to do it. The cannon fire drove away the engineers of the Dinghui Canal, and the price crushed the scholars, which the entire international bank cannot buy back.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau is still the same group of people that Li Yizhi brought, and there have been no changes so far. Most of them are Li's students. Shaanxi has achieved some success in water conservancy projects, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>Sanyuan at Dusk, Ancient City Canal Quiet</p>
<p>That evening, I still used the carriage with the surname Tie, leaving the Jingyang farm for Sanyuan. The vast mist gradually enveloped the fields, like a white silk wrapped around the waists of the white poplars. It was just getting dark when I arrived in Sanyuan. The carriage owner kindly took me directly to Dongguan. On the highway, there was a sign of Commander Hu Zongnan, which read in large letters: "Iron-wheeled carts are strictly prohibited from driving on the highway." Because the highway had just been repaired, filling in the ruts. These iron-wheeled carts, pulled by cattle or donkeys, were really powerful and could crush the cement road. My carriage traveled fifteen li on winding country roads before reaching the city of Sanyuan.</p>
<p>Sanyuan is like Suzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Many people who work in Xi'an live here. The small city of 50,000 people is very peaceful. The streets are also lined with neat, towering white poplars. Large and small shops, the calligraphy of Yu Youren on the signboards is everywhere in national stores, and the percentage of signboards with calligraphy by Yu Youren is probably the highest in Sanyuan. Because Sanyuan is Yu Youren's hometown, and Yu Youren's calligraphy has become a trend, even making it unrecognizable. The next day, I went to see the old gentleman's former residence, a few old houses, still with the old scenery. Next door, there is a very beautiful Minzhi Elementary School, which he founded. Every time he returns home, he does not live in the old house but lives in this elementary school. This street is called Xiguan Canal Bian. Large carts loading cotton are arriving one after another.</p>
<p>The city of Sanyuan has an air of affluence. The sounds of cotton ginning and weaving machines can be heard everywhere, all from family handicrafts. The faces of boys and girls are very delicate, which may be why Sanyuan has a Suzhou-like effect on Xi'an. There are as many as eight middle schools, but "the quantity is enough, but the quality is not." Sanyuan is known for its flourishing literary style. Yaoxian to the north is called the gateway to northern Shaanxi. "It will be difficult to go north." I began to hear this kind of talk in Sanyuan. In front of the county government, there are many stone tablets from the Ming and Qing dynasties, explaining the exile system of the Qing dynasty and engraving the water release regulations of the Ba'ou Canal. This canal is still there today. The only special feature of the streets in Sanyuan County is the canal, which is made of brick and is three meters wide. It is in the center of the street, used to draw water from several water ponds. Now the water has dried up, and children are playing in it. This canal was exquisitely built, with small bridges every ten steps or so. It was built with the assistance of the garrison in the 32nd year. People in the Northwest are grateful to those who give them water.</p>
<p>The County Council is in session because the county budget deficit has not been resolved and is in recess for three days. The county budget is almost always in deficit, and there is no source for the deficit. This kind of major problem is often unresolvable in formal meetings. The conclusion is mostly "local fundraising," either apportionment or dispatch. Now apportionment is prohibited, and if the Council comes out to resist, the problem cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>After the victory, the cotton farmers of Sanyuan suffered a bit. The government suddenly abandoned the control policy. The control policy was much criticized during the War of Resistance, but the sudden abandonment and the announcement that it would be purchased at "market prices" caught the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau unprepared, and the officials rushed around, each going their own way. The financial market suddenly changed, and most of the shops closed. The predictable victory depression was falling right when the cotton was coming to market. Cotton prices plummeted from 150,000 or 160,000 yuan to 15,000 or 16,000 yuan, a terrible drop of ten times! The cotton farmers sighed, carrying their loads into the city, but no one paid attention. The Sanyuan agricultural loan of 150 million yuan from the 34th year had to be repaid by the end of November. At that time, a loan of 15,000 yuan was equal to ten jin of cotton, but now it would require a dan. This situation was the same throughout Guanzhong, leading the cotton farmers to complain to heaven and earth, and beat the cotton seeds to extract oil. Sanyuan is the center of the cotton market, and the people of Sanyuan are still frightened. Today, large and small cotton purchasing firms in Sanyuan are lined up, but the cotton price is still low, at 150,000 or 160,000 yuan, and is scolded as a "trust." This number has completely changed its quality compared to before the victory. How high is the price of yarn? In contrast, how low is the price of cotton? How large is the scissor difference between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products? This is the direct pain of Chinese farmers today.</p>
<p>After the victory, enemy planes disappeared, conscription stopped, the treatment of troops was improved, and the troops stationed in Shaanxi in various war zones advanced to take over, and military transportation suddenly decreased. The last time the Provisional Council shouted loudly, "Quickly cut off unnecessary institutions to reduce the burden on the people. Anti-aircraft surveillance teams, anti-aircraft surveillance posts, national military corps, each township team leader and each bao team leader's officers and soldiers, as well as the military conscription committee, the fodder station and its stationed Fuping Yao management and transportation personnel, should all be abolished. Otherwise, the summer harvest will be a disaster. Victory depression, budget deficit, how can we get by?" These things were indeed done. But how long ago was that? Only a year ago, as soon as I entered Sanyuan, I ran into troop personnel who had come to collect new recruits, sweating profusely, asking me for directions. I said, "I don't know either! Sir."</p>
<p>I arrived in Sanyuan at dusk, and left Sanyuan at dusk. I have a good impression of this quiet ancient city in Guanzhong, except for a few unpleasant things.</p>

<h3>Sanyuan People's Sense of Supervision: A Victory Checklist - A Cold Hard Number - Tells How Much Sweetness, Sourness, and Bitterness!</h3>
<p>The old League members of Shaanxi Province are all hardliners and full of humor. The people of Sanyuan also seem to be like this, with serious faces, as if they all have a sense of supervision.</p>
<p>At the end of the War of Resistance, the people of Sanyuan produced a victory checklist, saying: Look at how much we contributed to the War of Resistance. It also said: How did the War of Resistance win? It also said: Look at how big a price the people of Sanyuan paid for victory? It also said: Look at how much pain we have? The checklist read:</p>
<p>The burden of our farmers: Since conscription began, the actual number of draftees totaled 13,162 (statistics from the National Military Corps); since the in-kind collection of land tax began, the actual amount of wheat collected totaled 267,981 shi, 5 dou, 2 sheng, and 7 he (statistics from the Land and Grain Department); 4,056 dan and 53 jin of cotton were levied (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Bureau); and since the procurement of military grain began in the 29th year of the Republic, a total of 102,684 packages of wheat and 3,681 packages of corn were transported (statistics from the county government). In the 32nd and 33rd years, a total of 73,065 dan and 69 jin of cotton were sold (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau's purchase statistics, the 31st year was not found). From January to August of the 34th year, various long and short-distance transportation and compensation for the purchase of military grain totaled 25,494,559 yuan. In addition to the small amount of money received for the supply of grass and fodder to the various armies, the total compensation was 50,764,639 yuan (the above are statistics from the Military Emblem Branch over the years, not including those under 1,000 yuan). From January to August of the 34th year, the average extra levy from each township totaled 58,489,624 yuan (statistics from various township offices over the years are not included). The above, excluding the draftees who cannot be calculated in money, the compensation for the purchase of military grain is not listed, and the difference in the control of cotton is not counted. The in-kind collection of wheat is temporarily calculated at an average of 1,000 yuan per shi, which is 267,752,522 yuan. The cotton levy is calculated at an average of 120,000 yuan per dan, which is 4,053,000 yuan. The total of the previous items is 800,838,349 yuan. For a small county with less than 100,000 people (99,088 people, county government statistics), based on a partially incomplete survey (the number of people includes merchants, the number of burdens does not include merchants), the contribution of money and effort to the country is so great, which can be said to be fulfilling the responsibility of the people.</p>
<p>The burden of our business and industry circles: According to the investigation, the business and industry people of this county, in addition to their formal tax obligations to the country for the past eight years, all the additional levies for the purchase of military wheat, national defense projects, public debt savings, donation of money and machines, compensation for carts and mules,慰勞伤兵, compulsory police, various civilian workers, and youth joining the army, and the additional apportionment of the local budget deficit have been increasing in stages. The additional funds for the business and industry circles were 5,600 yuan in the 26th year, 60,000 yuan in the 27th year, 156,000 yuan in the 28th year, 290,000 yuan in the 29th year, 1,955,000 yuan in the 30th year, 2,830,000 yuan in the 31st year, 8,080,000 yuan in the 32nd year, 6,986,000 yuan in the 33rd year, and 10,080,540 yuan as of the end of August in the 34th year, totaling 30,443,140 yuan. The formal taxes, excluding the unified tax and customs tax, which have not been investigated, and before the 31st year, the figures for income tax, profit tax, and before the 33rd year, the figures for business tax and stamp tax are unclear. It is estimated that the profit taxes in the 32nd year were 9 million yuan, the business tax in the 33rd year was 5 million yuan, the stamp tax was 5 million yuan, the profit taxes were 17,733,300 yuan, the business tax in the 34th year was 10 million yuan, and the stamp tax was 10 million yuan, totaling 56,733,300 yuan (statistics from the Chamber of Commerce). With more than 530 retail businesses, without any company with more than one million yuan in capital (statistics and registration from the Chamber of Commerce members), such a burden cannot be said to be small. Before the war, there were no factories in this county. Two or three years before the victory, due to supply and demand relations, there was a gradual business of weaving domestic cloth, but it was soon controlled by the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau and changed to weaving military cloth, only paying wages, receiving yarn and exchanging cloth, and not being able to operate privately. It is estimated that there were 435 wooden machines initially registered. Among them, 151 were closed due to losses, and only 284 remain. Over the years, they have handed over military cloth, amounting to more than 271,000 yuan at the military supplies bureau (statistics from the Sanyuan Textile Industry Promotion Branch); and 138,756 pi (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau). This contribution to the war effort is also not insignificant.</p>
<p>I think it is easy to do this work. If the people in the rear of the War of Resistance, like the people of Sanyuan, come up with a checklist, it can be calculated how much the people in the rear of the War of Resistance directly contributed to the War of Resistance. What about the National Assembly representatives from various provinces and cities? Do you have this kind of number in your leather包裹?</p>
<h3>Additional Surtax on the Boxer Indemnity: A Painful Account of Land Tax History from the People of Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The people of Shaanxi still remember the years when Empress Dowager Cixi fled and the Boxer Indemnity was imposed. The people of Sanyuan County are protesting, saying that they are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity. The people of the entire Shaanxi Province are also protesting, saying that they are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity. This is surprising and is tantamount to recounting the chaotic history of land tax in Shaanxi. The complete book on land tax only offered a preface. During my journey in the northern part of Guanzhong, I witnessed the particularly heavy burden of land tax in Shaanxi compared to other provinces. Calculated per yuan, one had to pay 1.4 dou of wheat as land tax (50% each for central and local governments); 1.4 dou of wheat as military rations (delivered to the central government); and 0.42 dou of wheat as public grain (50% each for the province and local governments). In total, 3.22 dou of wheat were levied per yuan. During the War of Resistance, 5 dou were levied per yuan. This year, Sanyuan County is short 16,390 shi of public grain in its budget, which is a difficult problem currently being discussed by the Council. In the past, what Shaanxi called "Diding Yin" was where "Di" meant land tax and "Ding" meant changing conscription to recruitment, with additional taxes levied through land tax. Therefore, it was collectively called "Diding". A notice of apportionment in Anyang, Henan, reads: "Mr. So-and-so, so much in Diding Yang," which is calculated based on how much land he owns. Traces of the Qing Dynasty can still be seen today. This Diding Yin has become a regular silver. A Shaanxi proverb says: "One regular, one wasteland," meaning that in addition to one tael of regular silver, the additional wasteland silver ("huangyin") would also amount to more than one tael. This wasteland silver varied from county to county in Shaanxi Province, some at seven qian and some at nine qian, of which three qian was for the Boxer Indemnity. In addition, there were the old customary fees, the basis for the Chinese saying "promotion and wealth." The items included loss compensation (melting loss of broken silver), "da ping yu" (large balance surplus), "xiao ping yu" (small balance surplus), courtyard room clerks, meal expenses, delivery fees, new balance, paper fees, vermilion fees, local retention for errands, etc. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Shaanxi military government reorganized the land tax, bringing both regular and wasteland silver to the provincial level. Local governments had no funds, and the burden was not reduced, because local governments raised funds separately, and the amount was even heavier. From this beginning, the people of Shaanxi said, "We are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity," and one tael of silver became 1.7 to 1.9 taels, heavier than in other provinces.</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Republic, the yuan was changed twice. One tael of flat silver (pingyin) was equivalent to 1.5 yuan in new national currency. Under the principle of "equal burden, no reduction in total amount," the 92 counties of Shaanxi Province uniformly converted at 1.8 qian per tael, becoming 2.7 yuan, which was still completely transferred to the provincial treasury. Because local governments needed funds, they invented "land tax surcharges," which increased every year. In the 29th year, the government finally issued an order: surcharges shall not exceed 100%. Thus, 100% was levied uniformly, and 2.7 yuan became 5.4 yuan, that is, in addition to the 1.5 yuan of one tael of regular silver, an additional 3.9 yuan was added.</p>
<p>Starting in the 26th year, the Ministry of Finance designated that regular taxes and surcharges (referring to wasteland silver) would be allocated to the national treasury and implemented a national treasury system. Local governments would receive monthly payments from the national treasury. The people of Shaanxi have been scolding Finance Minister Zhou Jiechun for being absurd. He actually reported all 5.4 yuan to the ministry, including the 2.7 yuan of local surcharges, and stipulated a method of allocating 55% of this 2.7 yuan for local expenses, which was unprecedented among all provinces.</p>
<p>However, this 55% could not be issued on time once it entered the treasury. Local governments needed money urgently and could not delay it. Therefore, they had to add surcharges again, but not call them surcharges. From then on, they invented apportionment. If one wants to study the history of apportionment in Shaanxi or has a penchant for research, this is the original material.</p>
<p>After the 30th year, land tax and surcharges were levied in kind. Shaanxi still calculated at 5.4 yuan, levying 5 dou of wheat per yuan. Local expenditures were 15% of the surcharge in kind, as very expensive for local undertakings, that is, 0.405 yuan was drawn from 2.7 yuan. The method in Shaanxi was special. Instead of providing in kind, it was converted into money and issued. As a result, in the 32nd year, wheat was 1,000 yuan per shi, but the converted value was only 120 yuan. In the 30th year, it was 2,400 yuan per shi, and 200 yuan was issued. In the 34th year, it rose to 17,000 yuan per shi, but the converted value was 600 yuan. The so-called appropriation of 0.405 yuan was actually less than 0.04 yuan. However, every year the local budget was insufficient, often tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, and the expenses for garrison troops were huge. Therefore, the apportionments developed into a new stage, repeating and repeating, failing utterly!</p>
<p>This year, in order to reduce the burden on the people, the government reduced the surcharge by 50%, that is, subtracting 1.35 yuan from 2.7 yuan, but the total amount is still 4.05 yuan. If based on the principle that the additional surcharge does not exceed 100%, then the regular tax and surcharge should be no more than 3 yuan. This year, reducing it by 50% would often be 2.5 yuan. In any case, it should be reduced by 1.05 yuan or 2.45 yuan. The people of Shaanxi are still going to protest. They have been protesting for 35 years.</p>
<p>However, the people of Shaanxi silently said: "This reduction of 1.35 yuan can be regarded as canceling the Boxer Indemnity, right? Moreover, the indemnity was only 0.9 yuan, which is already much stronger."</p>
<p>I left Sanyuan in the twilight, drove 70 li to Yaoxian County, and knocked on the gate late at night, entering the gateway to northern Shaanxi. I heard that it was snowing in Xi'an. Yaoxian County is hundreds of meters higher than Xi'an. No wonder the cold is so biting.</p>

<h3>From Dongtai to Nantong</h3>
<p>— Nantong Dispatch on the 10th, by Ling Songshou, Our Reporter in Taixian</p>
<p>After the recovery of Dongtai, I made another trip to Nantong. Originally, there was no such plan. The night before departure, Section Chief Li of the adjutant's office jokingly said to me, "Go to Nantong, shall we?" I thought to myself, since I was idle in Dongtai, I might as well go to Nantong. Before this matter, it seemed that going or not going to Dongtai was irrelevant; but once this decision was made, I began to think about many things to do.</p>
<p>The next morning, I set off at nine o'clock, in a light-duty transport truck. This truck was for sending the Air Force liaison mobile team back to Nantong, so in addition to a truckload of people, there were many parts. As a result, the truck appeared particularly crowded. Upon arriving in the urban area of Nantong, what caught my eye was the clean streets, tall buildings, and prosperous market... Everything was full of vitality; especially after seeing enough of the desolation after the calamity in the recovered area, coming here was refreshing, and I felt infinite joy in my heart. The primary school students were dismissed from school and, led by the teachers, lined up to walk out of the school gate, lively and innocent. Seeing this group of little angels, I thought to myself: "China still has hope!"</p>
<p>Six full hours of bumping and sandstorms were really unbearable. However, because there were too many events, and the truck had to be driven back to Dongtai the next morning, I could not care about the fatigue of my body. After finding a hotel, I went to the street to take a look.</p>
<p>Nantong is in northern Jiangsu, like Yangzhou and Taixian; although it has gone through eight years of vicissitudes, it has not been destroyed by war. Buses, Jeeps, and private cars were flying on the road. Three-story and five-story buildings were standing tall. Red and green neon lights were shining... All kinds of facts proved that although Nantong was after a great calamity, it was still rich and prosperous. The nickname "Little Shanghai" is worthy of it.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Nantong still has not escaped the state of military times. There is a curfew at 11 o'clock in the evening; and, if you pay attention, you can sometimes find a bunker next to the wide road.</p>
<p>After running around and buying something, it was already evening. The original plan to visit Commander Li Mo'an had to be moved to the next day. After eating a random dinner in the restaurant, I went to the hotel and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Because I heard that the truck was leaving very early, I got up early the next morning. I ran to the Nantong branch of our newspaper, but the person in charge had not yet come home. After waiting for a while, I discussed some distribution plans with them, and then went to the Pacification District Headquarters. It was too early, and the commander had not yet gone to the office. I took a break and ate some snacks at the snack shop. Then I went to the headquarters, where I was received by the commander in the office.</p>
<h3>Commander: A Scholar in Military Uniform, Looking Forward to the Complete Clarification of the Situation in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>I knew from the newspaper that the commander was a scholar in military uniform. After meeting him, it further proved the truth of this statement. Not too tall, with a smiling face and a relaxed tone, set off the grace and serenity of this person who manages the military and political affairs of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The commander knew that I was from Dongtai. He earnestly inquired about the situation in the recovered area. He deeply cared about the suffering of the people in the recovered area and repeatedly instructed me to report more on the suffering of the people and the atrocities of the Communist army, so that the general public could recognize how the people of northern Jiangsu were in a state of dire straits.</p>
<p>Then, I asked the commander about the future of the situation in northern Jiangsu. The commander's opinion was this. He believed that, militarily, the complete clarification of the situation in northern Jiangsu was something that could no longer be delayed. The important policy for future governance lies in how to stabilize the people's livelihood after the great calamity and actively correct the psychological errors of the people. Everything in the future depends on the work efficiency of the local administrative authorities.</p>
<p>It was already more than eight o'clock, and Section Chief Li of the adjutant's office rushed to the headquarters to urge me to get on the truck. Time did not allow me to delay any longer. I asked the commander to allow me to take a photo. The commander agreed and went downstairs with me to find a good background.</p>
<h3>General Li Mo'an in the Garden of the Pacification District Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Photo by Ling Songshou, Our Reporter)</p>
<p>The commander's house was probably a Catholic church. It was surrounded by water on three sides, and the environment was quite good. There was a garden behind the house, and we chose this place as the background to take a photo.</p>
<p>I was about to leave, and the commander wrote a few words for me:</p>
<p>"Life is to serve the people."</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to the commander, I asked him if he was planning to inspect Dongtai.</p>
<p>"Of course! As soon as the airport is repaired, perhaps in two or three days I will go," the commander replied.</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "I am waiting for the commander's visit in Dongtai."</p>
<p>The commander smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>I left the Pacification Headquarters. I also left Nantong.</p>

<h3>Introducing the Person and Paintings of Fu Baoshi</h3>
<p>— Tang Qingge</p>
<p>If an artist's personality is noble, his painting style must also be noble! Because they have an interrelated relationship, which can be cause and effect. Therefore, if an artist wants his work to reach the peak of perfection, he must first cultivate his knowledge and morality. Otherwise, no matter how skilled your technique is, what you paint is just a mediocre scenic picture composed of colors and lines on paper, not a weighty and living work of art.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu Baoshi can be regarded as a modern Chinese artist with a noble personality and a noble painting style. I saw his paintings first and then met him; I loved his paintings first and then respected him. It was precisely because I saw his paintings and loved them; I smelled a similar breath in the style of his paintings, that I was willing to meet him and respect him! Only in this way did we become good friends. However, readers should not misunderstand, I am not praising him because Baoshi is a "good friend," I am introducing him out of respect for the soul of art.</p>
<p>Baoshi studied painting in Japan for many years and is currently a professor in the Art Department of Central University. He has a noble artistic soul. He regards painting as his second life. He cherishes his second life. Therefore, he is meticulous in every stroke when he paints. If he has to hold an art exhibition to make a living or to exchange for painting materials, then his most proud works will not be priced, that is, he will never be willing to use the crystallization of his hard work as a commodity. He feels that if he does that, it would be the stench of money insulting his soul and also insulting art—on the other hand, if he gives a painting to a friend—a friend who understands his paintings—then he will definitely give his most proud work to the friend. He sells very few paintings, but he bears the heavy burden of a family of five or six. His life can be said to be quite difficult, but his spiritual cultivation has enabled him to uphold a noble artistic soul! He spends his artistic and supreme simple life in the poor and remote village of Jin Gangpo in Chongqing during the Great Rear Area. Apart from tobacco and alcohol, he has no hobbies. Tobacco and alcohol are his inspiration and his tonic. He cannot paint without tobacco and alcohol. Therefore, he takes a puff of smoke and drinks a glass of wine for every stroke he paints. When he is slightly drunk, the work is completed. He is such a unrestrained and upright painter. He is so indifferent to fame and wealth, but so serious about art!</p>
<p>Baoshi is not only a painter, but also an art theorist. He has created a lot in art theory. His solid and profound theoretical foundation has also helped him to succeed in his paintings. The style of his paintings is ancient and has the style of the Tang and Song Dynasties. The artistic conception is transcendent, the interest is elegant, the aura is magnificent, the brushwork is firm but not rigid, the coloring is simple and moist but not dry; the material is pure and elegant, and the composition is unique. For example, the "Eastern Mountain Leisure" published here shows his wisdom. Why does his painting have these advantages? We can see from his paintings his cultivation of knowledge and morality. He has read a lot of dead books and living books, so he can nurture the true meaning of life in his paintings, and in his brush and ink, there is an implicit revelation of infinite philosophy. This revelation makes you feel that life should be enjoyed in a kind of sublimated realm! Naturally, there are not many people who can appreciate and accept his artistic attainment, but he will never change his style because of this, tend to flatter, and pander to low-level requirements.</p>
<p>However, I also feel that Baoshi's artistic life seems to be a little fragile, that is, his artistic view seems to be a little negative. If this is his shortcoming (some friends who love him have criticized him to me in this way), it is very easy to make up for it, just pay attention to the selection of materials. For example, in order to cooperate with today's ideological trends, he can use his excellent skills in landscape and figures to draw more historical achievements, such as Qu Yuan's loyalty and Tao Yuanming's noble integrity, which are enough to express the national spirit and can increase the weight of his paintings. I have this kind of superficial view, I wonder if Baoshi thinks so?</p>
<p>Some people advocate that Chinese painting must be improved, or even a combination of Chinese and Western painting. I am very opposed to combining things that are incompatible. I think Chinese painting has its traditional value, and we should have the belief to preserve the essence of national art—Western painting is Western painting, and it has its own independent artistic value, so there is no need to combine it with Chinese painting. In fact, writing Western painting with the technique of Chinese painting, or writing Chinese painting with the technique of Western painting, cannot be reconciled. Therefore, I advocate that each should stick to its position, each should work hard on its specialty, and each should have its own merits! Baoshi is a painter who is loyal to Chinese painting. He has a unique creative spirit. Although he has an ancient style, he does not fall into the common imitation style! This may be because he reads a lot of books and studies deeply. I hope he will always maintain this rigorous artistic attitude.</p>
<p>Baoshi will hold an art exhibition in Shanghai soon. Before the people of Shanghai see his works, I will briefly introduce them above. It is inevitable that I will make a fool of myself by talking about painting outside the door. I am very afraid!</p>
<h3>Eastern Mountain Leisure</h3>
<p>— Fu Baoshi</p>
<h3>The History of Xunqin Painting</h3>
<p>— Pang</p>
<p>My younger brother was four years old, and he made figures at his desk, with lifelike expressions. Confucius set up a teaching at Apricot Altar, with dozens of disciples, some pondering, some looking, some opening, some whispering, none the same, truly a genius. Mr. Pu, a friend of his father, was good at calligraphy, painting, silk, bamboo, and often held his brother on his lap, teaching him flowers and plants, mountains and rivers. At the age of nine, he could already make large paintings. His father taught him very strictly. Except for family members, he never showed them to others. At the age of fourteen, he came to Shanghai to join the Zhenqie school. There was no painting in the school. After school, he learned charcoal and oil painting from a Russian old man. After five years, he stayed in France and devoted himself to further study. He also traveled to Germany and Belgium, and returned to China after nine years.</p>
<p>He was naturally indifferent, not greedy for honor and profit. He did nothing else except hold a pen to conceive ideas every day. In the lane, he made large-scale oil paintings, advertising designs, architectural designs, women's clothing, with deep meaning and meticulous brushwork. He closed his studio in the west building, with mountains in view. The furnishings were quiet and ancient. When you entered his room, you almost forgot that you were a person of this century. The scenery was taken from Wulin Jigu, and he went to the ancient capital in person. The old residence was just right, and the masterpiece was completed. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he returned to Shanghai. After the August 13th battle, he knew that the war of resistance would be long. He fled the flames of war in a hurry and turned into the inland. The lane was occupied, the old residence was occupied, and everything was lost. What he regretted most was that he had collected no less than 10,000 volumes of books, handwritten by his ancestors, and the twenty years of effort of Xunqin were all gone, leaving not a single paper. He wandered in Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces, deep in the area of the Miao Yi people. He browsed the ancient and modern times in the Central Research Institute and the Central Museum, collected ideas and broadened his horizons, and was able to integrate Chinese and Western art and culture into one furnace. After the victory, he returned east. There was no residence in Shanghai, and he was about to leave. Mr. Fu Nuan and his brother were friends, and he advocated the exhibition of paintings and personally organized them. His high righteousness is admirable.</p>
<h3>The Finishing Touch</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yuguang, an old painter, has been famous in the art world for forty years. He has a deep friendship with revolutionary pioneers such as Niu Yongjian and Jing Hengyi. Mr. Zhang Bao can also be called a revolutionary in the art world. His brushwork melts Chinese and Western styles into one furnace, so he named his forehead "Zhi Ou Lu". Last month, he held an exhibition of paintings of returning from the rear in the Ningbo Township Association in Shanghai, exhibiting the paintings he collected during his travels in the southwest. The paintings of clouds, hills, mountains, birds and animals were sold out. The flying price of art is obvious to all. I used to work with him in the Mingxing Film Company for more than ten years. Yesterday, I met him in Caohejing "Guan Nong". After ten years of separation, Mr. Zhang's hair was all white, but his spirit was radiant and he looked healthier. So I had dinner in the garden. The owners of the garden, Guan Shengguang and Shengsheng, recuperated their spirits and lived here for a long time, and asked Zhang Shengguang to correct the layout, and the "Guan Nong" was reorganized in the sound of recovery, and it has been opened, serving as an embellishment to the western suburbs of Shanghai, which is very popular among small and middle schools in the city. Mr. Xian often engages in garden construction during his spare time, and even transplants every grass and tree himself, and his humble style is admirable. All the points pointed out by Mr. Zhang Guang were changed accordingly. I feel that the "Guan Nong" has been corrected by Zhang Guang, and has the elegance and tranquility of literati and poets, which is enough for ordinary scholars and poets to travel through. So the finishing touch of Zhang Yuguang is not meaningless.</p>
<h3>Visiting Wanfo Lou</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the history of Chinese painting, the development of figure painting was still in the Liu and Han Dynasties, such as Cai Yong's "Small Biographies of Women" and Mao Yanshou's "Paintings of Ladies", which showed signs of progress. Until the Ming Dynasty, Buddhism was introduced to China, and Buddhist culture and Chinese culture exchanged, opening up a new situation in art. The painter's brush also manifested the golden body and real image. The so-called "Samma Sambodhi, every Buddha is a Tathagata" is expressed in painting. This harvest is indeed very rich.</p>
<p>In terms of recent masters of painting Buddhas, there are Wang Yiting, the hermit of Bailong Mountain, and Qian Huafu, the master of Wanfo Lou. Yiting has passed away a few years ago, and the only surviving one is Qian Huafu. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he did not sniff at fashion, but worked hard at his own position, even cutting off his food. He would rather tighten his belt and endure it without bowing his head or kneeling. Therefore, some people call him Qian Luohan, which he truly deserves. He lives in a narrow and cramped alley behind the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road. There is almost no room to turn around when guests come. Moreover, there is a situation where people in the slums cannot bear his worries, but he does not care at all. Recently, he moved to a new residence at No. 1 Feng Deli, Jinxian Road. I went to visit his new residence and took the opportunity to talk to him.</p>
<p>The new residence is much wider, and it is upstairs, high and refreshing, which is suitable for work. On the day of the visit, he was painting a picture of a wall-facing Bodhidharma, with green and blue colors, and it was eighty-nine percent complete. When he saw me, he stopped painting and greeted me. Looking up, the walls were full of beautiful things, with inscriptions by Sun Yat-sen, Wu Zhihui, and Yu Youren, and Liang Zizhen's writing, "Blessings are boundless, longevity and health", this kind of auspicious sign can indeed make people excited, especially in the midst of troubles and sorrows, it is enough to eliminate everything.</p>
<p>His great work "Yu the Great Taming the Flood" is prepared as an international gift to U.S. President Truman, and it has now been successfully completed. This picture uses four-foot Xuan paper in 26 sheets, forming a large roll, which is more than ten feet long. Among the figures, there are dignified ones, strange ones, enchanting women, majestic armored soldiers, and bull-headed demons, rushing and soaking each other. He instructed me to write a preface-style short essay on it, preparing to ask Wu Zhihui to write it. I wrote a few sentences in a scribbled manner: "Yu's taming of the flood is a great achievement for thousands of years, and Mencius recorded it. The so-called digging the ground and pouring it into the sea, driving the snakes and releasing them, that's it. Layman Huafu can respond to things, shape images, and follow the class to give colors, creating this great structure, vitality, power, charm and interest, all embedded in the width of the Zhang. Combining Zhang Sengyao and Gu Hutou in one hand, the exquisite attainment is unparalleled in the world. Now, the floods are rampant, and the people cannot live in peace, which is no less than what happened hundreds of years ago. However, those who have the power to turn the tide and lay the foundation are more worthy of praise than the God Yu. Huafu Layman made this, and that's what he meant!" Fortunately, he asked Master Wu to write it, and I would like to ask Master Wu to cut my clumsy essay, and I don't have to modify it myself. According to him, the motive for this painting was still during the War of Resistance. According to the Chongqing news, Zhang Daqian painted a picture of a hundred doves and gave it to the United States. Until the news of victory came, in the excitement, he adjusted the Danqing ink and drew this "Yu the Great Taming the Flood", stipulating that he would work for several hours every day, and it was only recently that he was able to complete the entire work. After spending more than a year of time and achieving such considerable results, he couldn't help but be complacent when he occasionally exhibited it!</p>
<p>He has an ancient zither hanging on the wall. Most interestingly, his name is Qian Huafu, and there are several copper coins embedded in the mirror frame, marked with the words "Buddha Transforms Money". It is said that the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng, Henan, was built in the Tang Dynasty, with 500 copper arhats inside, each two feet six inches tall. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, during the Zhili-Feng War, General Ji Jian led the army in Henan and recast the copper arhats into copper coins, divided into five types: two hundred, one hundred, fifty, twenty, and ten. The copper coins in the mirror frame are the recast products of the copper arhats. His friend specially gave them to him. Thus, Qian Huafu and Buddha Transforms Money have become interesting patterns.</p>
<p>Before the restoration of the Republic of China, he participated in underground work, so he can also be called the first daredevil. During the enemy-puppet period, he risked his life to tear off the announcements of the Japanese military and political authorities and the puppet organization, one by one. After eight years, he became a complete set, which he plans to exhibit publicly in the future. If this kind of action were discovered by the enemy and puppets at that time, he might be executed. He often took advantage of the late night, especially when the weather was stormy and rainy, and there were few people, so he held a broken umbrella and acted according to the opportunity. Fortunately, he did not encounter a raid. He still has lingering fears when he recalls it.</p>
<p>He and I co-authored two notes, "Nianhua Smiling" and "Blooming Flowers", each with dozens of articles. He cut and pasted them into a book, actually two thick volumes. He said, "This snow-mud-goose-print-style thing can be printed into a single book, and many copperplate photos are added to it. Isn't it very interesting?"</p>
<p>Drinking is his only pastime. He doesn't care about appetizers when he drinks. Any peanuts, dried tofu, green vegetables, and radishes can be eaten. He said that drinking should be based on the wine, and choosing appetizers would lose the meaning of drinking. Today, I am happy, and drinking a glass of wine will add to the fun; today, I am depressed, and drinking a glass of wine will use it to anesthetize. Therefore, for many years, I have unknowingly formed an inextricable bond with alcohol. At this time, he took out a bottle of white rose wine from the table and wanted to drink with me. I declined and said goodbye to him.</p>
<h3>Poetic Words</h3>
<p>— Tian Su</p>
<p>Poetry should be the most beautiful thing. Whether a poem is passionate and vigorous or sorrowful and beautiful, if it lacks the element of beauty, it is like a dying patient.</p>
<p>It is not an overstatement to say that poetry is the highest expression of literary art because it can be as sharp as a famous sword, like the prose of Sui Wen; it can also be like a painting, with the clarity of prose; and sometimes, it can even tell us a novel-like story.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 122</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"These two people who came are more considerate of you than we are." Chrysanthemum's voice trembled a little, not out of jealousy, but an impulse of affection.</p>
<p>"Two people?" Tsurumi was a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes." Chrysanthemum answered, "One came at six o'clock in the afternoon. She is a 'sweet lady,' only the beauties in paintings are so sweet. Hearing that you were resting, she immediately lowered her voice, fearing to disturb you. She wrote this little note and repeatedly instructed me to hand it over to you at the most appropriate time." Chrysanthemum said, handing the note to Tsurumi. (The words "sweet lady" were a secret code used by Chrysanthemum and Tsurumi in their childhood, representing a beauty.)</p>
<p>"Elder Brother—thinking that you must have many things to ask me, I followed your footsteps and came here to visit. If you are unhappy or unwilling to see this annoying person, I will naturally quietly leave. Later, whenever you want, just make a phone call to the 'Club,' and I will rush over like a bird, at your disposal. I swear on my life, I will never do anything deceitful to you. Wishing Elder Brother good health… Furthermore, my telephone numbers are in the 'Club' list, a total of four, I won’t list them here… Furthermore, I am staying at the Binhai Society tonight, my younger sister knows its telephone number and location… Furthermore, younger sister is a lovely person, I would like to befriend her, as long as she doesn’t dislike me—From Liu Shi’s hand."</p>
<p>After reading it, Tsurumi suddenly raised his head and asked Chrysanthemum, "Chrysanthemum, do you like this 'sweet lady'?"</p>
<p>"I do!" Chrysanthemum smiled very innocently, "I would like to have an autographed photo of her…"</p>
<p>"Ha…she is a thorny rose!...You have to be careful…You just said two people, what about the other person, is it a young man, my car driver?"</p>
<p>"That's right." Chrysanthemum answered, glancing at her mother. The mother and daughter smiled at each other, indicating that Tsurumi guessed correctly. "He came a little after seven o'clock, he said he would come again a little after ten o'clock."</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the crescent moon gradually rose from the horizon, the boundless ocean rippling with patches of rosy light, like the bejeweled pond in a fantasy with golden lotus flowers blooming. The pine trees on the hillside seemed to be covered with a layer of deep blue tulle, and the beach also reflected a patch of glittering silver light. In such a scene, Tsurumi and Pingzi walked side by side along the edge of the beach.</p>
<p>Tsurumi—"What method does that one-eyed Fifth Column guy use to collect our actions and conversations?"</p>
<p>Ping—"It's my fault for being too careless. I also know that trick. No matter how far away, as long as you can see the person's lips moving, you can know what they are saying."</p>
<p>Tsurumi—"That's lip reading. How long does it take to learn the method of using eyes instead of ears?"</p>
<p>Ping—"Two or three months, I have this manuscript, I am afraid it will only take you two or three hours to learn."</p>
<p>Tsurumi—"Can I borrow it to take a look?"</p>
<p>Ping—"I can offer it to you at any time."</p>
<p>Tsurumi—"How many Fifth Column members are there in Tokyo?"</p>
<p>Ping—"There are only three or four thousand now, possibly more and more. They have all kinds of specialized skills and have infiltrated our various top secret agencies."</p>
<h3>Casual Talk About Female Writers</h3>
<p>— Tan Yi</p>
<p>Bai Wei, Impoverished and Ill</p>
<p>Recently, someone asked me if it was true that Bai Wei was so poor in Chongqing that she had lice on her body and lived under other people's eaves?</p>
<p>It is a recognized fact that literati are poor, especially in the wartime rear, especially a literatus who is open, upright, and steadfast in his position. However, although poor, it should not be so poor as to be covered in lice, sleeping on the stone steps like a beggar begging from door to door. However, Bai Wei's poverty has led to such rumors, and it has spread to Shanghai, which is really surprising. However, Bai Wei was indeed poorer than the average literatus in Chongqing, not only poor, but also often sick. She did not have a fixed residence in Chongqing, often living in the countryside near the Laijia Bridge Political Department. Occasionally, when she came to Chongqing, she could only carry a small cloth bag and "fight guerrilla warfare" at friends' places. Her friends were not rich either, living a "under the eaves of Chongqing" life. When Bai Wei visited, she could only be an "eaves guest." Perhaps this is the origin of the rumors? As for the lice on her body, although I have never seen it with my own eyes, I think it should not be so. Although she was too poor to buy new clothes, the Western suits she wore from her time studying in Tokyo ten years ago were still very neat. Especially in the summer, although she did not have a maid to wash and iron them for her, her clothes were always so smooth and clean. With such a neat appearance, there should not be lice inside, right?</p>
<p>There were many literati working or nominally working in the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission. Such as Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Feng Naichao and others. Later, it was reorganized into the Cultural Work Committee, and Guo Moruo, the former head of the Third Department, was transferred to be the chairman of the Cultural Work Committee, and the original staff were also transferred there. The Political Department is a military organization. Although the staff of the Cultural Work Committee were "literati," they were also given military ranks. For example, Chairman Guo was a lieutenant general, Tian Laoda was a major general, and the rest were colonels, lieutenant colonels, and even lieutenants, second lieutenants, and junior lieutenants. However, because Bai Wei was neither a military person nor a woman, and because the ranks of general and colonel were national titles and could not be casually given to a non-military woman, she had to be a clerk.</p>
<p>A clerk is certainly not an official, which was insignificant to Bai Wei, who did not aspire to be ennobled. However, there was a practical problem in this. Because only "officials" could enjoy the welfare of officers and soldiers in addition to their fixed salaries. Clerks were extra personnel and were not included in the national budget, so she could only watch others enjoy this welfare. And the worst thing was that the welfare at that time was actually much larger than the regular salary, almost all of life depended on the welfare. Bai Wei could not get the welfare, so she was more miserable than other military literati.</p>
<p>Although miserable, she wanted to fight against misery, she wanted to survive in misery. She would never betray others, be jealous of others, or beg for pity from others, or complain to others. She had a pair of hands. In addition to being able to write articles, she could also do what other laborers could do. So she grew her own vegetables, drew water, washed clothes, cooked, and even did the most dirty housework. In this way, she conquered misery and earned her seat. But her writing life was sacrificed because there are only twenty-four hours in a day!</p>
<p>Prose and novels, although limited by time, prevented her from having time to write, but poetry was relatively less restricted. She could meditate while washing vegetables, and hum while fanning the stove with a palm-leaf fan. She would write them down in her spare time from work. So her only product during the Anti-Japanese War was poetry.</p>
<p>She was not afraid of poverty alone. What was more frightening was the illness that followed. And it was a serious illness. She was staying in the Chongqing Municipal Hospital, not only could she not afford the hospitalization fee, but she also did not have money for medicine. Fortunately, several friends helped her to get through this difficult time. At this time, someone launched a campaign to help impoverished and sick writers, dancing, acting, charity sales, fundraising, raising several million yuan in funds. But when the Writers' Association allocated her 20,000 yuan in relief money, she resolutely refused. She did not explain the reason for refusing. But from this, we can also see her backbone, she is a tough guy who would never take money for no reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps life and human relationships have persecuted her, she is now more calm and indifferent. We often see her carrying a small cloth bag, walking slowly alone, never taking military cars. Her haggard face, with a pair of gold-rimmed round glasses, never has any expression. When talking to people, it is so subtle that the other person does not dare to take a deep breath. She has never shouted loudly about "peace" or "democracy" with a red face! But her tone is always so peaceful, and her energy always expresses people's rights.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese War has become profitable, many villains have changed their environment, have new jobs, and have changed their attitudes. Only she remains the same. At most, she has changed from a guest under the eaves of Chongqing to a guest under the eaves of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Hot Money</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Nanjing is making a fuss about establishing the capital, Nanjing, Beiping, there will still be a while of clamor.</p>
<p>Shanghai is clamoring for year-end bonuses, and also creating a new term—“lazy labor.” In a gust of wind, gold broke the three million mark, the US dollar reached six thousand three, and Chinese stocks all hit the daily limit. So lively!</p>
<p>It looks like this year we are really going to have to spend a lot, we can’t just muddle through, what should we do? It’s really nerve-wracking!</p>
<p>There’s no need to talk about any profound economic theories, common sense can tell us that gold and US dollars flying together, firewood, rice, oil, and salt all jumping, rising prices, is an inevitable result. And how can Shanghai’s soaring prices not affect other parts of the country?</p>
<p>Some people say that this whirlwind is due to the release of hot money. Please think about it, where are the reasons for the release of a large amount of hot money?</p>
<p>The government’s financial policy can no longer waver. If it is to tighten the currency and tighten credit, it should stick to it. If it wavers, it will create opportunities for speculators to make huge profits. Taking clothes off the dead, this society is all about profit, what can’t they do!</p>
<h3>Taking a Honesty Test by Observing Society and People's Hearts</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>How honest are the people around you? This is a difficult question to answer, but also a question that should be answered to understand the level of social morality. A Canadian named Alexander Taylor has come up with a clever way to answer this question. He wrote his address on twenty-four envelopes and enclosed a folded piece of newspaper inside each envelope. The sealed flaps were marked with indelible pencil, so that if the flaps were opened and resealed, these marks would reveal the act.</p>
<p>After putting stamps on each envelope, Taylor scattered them evenly on the streets of Toronto and Hamilton. Each letter was numbered, and after scattering them, Taylor himself hid to the side to watch how the passersby handled these "lost" letters.</p>
<p>His first experiment was done on the streets of Hamilton. It was four-thirty in the afternoon, and the streets were crowded.</p>
<p>A woman stopped and picked up the first letter. She looked at it indifferently and walked into a department store. A few minutes later, a young woman picked up the second letter, looked at the address, and dropped it into the mailbox on the corner.</p>
<p>On another street, he saw a man pick up the third letter. He read the address, folded the envelope, and put it in his pocket. This letter never returned to Taylor's hands.</p>
<p>Another letter was placed in the same spot for a long time. Some people stepped over it, while others detoured around it. A strong girl came over, wanting to kick it, but didn't. She took a step forward, then stopped, looking back at the letter, but couldn't decide whether to walk back. Suddenly, she hurried on her way.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the train station, a man picked up a letter and said to his friend, "This letter must be mailed, I wonder who lost it!" He walked to the mailbox and dropped the letter in.</p>
<p>As a result, of the twelve letters Taylor scattered in Hamilton, all but two were picked up and mailed back to him.</p>
<p>Taylor did the same experiment in Toronto. Coincidentally, also two went missing, and ten were mailed back.</p>
<p>All the letters that were picked up and mailed had never been opened. In Hamilton, seventy people walked past the twelve letters before they were picked up. In Toronto, eighty passersby ignored them. Those who picked up the scattered letters in Toronto were ten men and two women, and those who picked up the twelve letters scattered in Hamilton were half men and half women. This small experiment proved that: if someone lost a letter in these two cities, the chances of the finder mailing it for them are 80 percent.</p>
<p>Of course, the results of this experiment cannot represent the extent of honesty in general, but at least it can give us a glimpse.</p>
<p>Readers, if you also want to imitate Taylor and do such an experiment, I dare to guarantee that the results you get will be much lower than the results Taylor got, it's not that I'm "inferior" here.</p>
<h3>Beware of the Chamber Pot Thief</h3>
<p>— Wu Shujiang</p>
<p>The term chamber pot thief is what the author heard from the natives of Shanghai. The period of activity of the chamber pot thief is in the recent two or three months, and the colder the weather, the more energetic they are.</p>
<p>However, the chamber pot thief's tricks are limited to large families with deep courtyards.</p>
<p>Just as the sky is beginning to dawn, the "chamber pot pouring" maids and elder sisters are drowsy, opening the back door, and bringing out the chamber pot. In that instant, the chamber pot thief slips in and hides in a remote place, lying still during the day and moving around at night. Whenever it is late at night and everyone is quiet, they go out to scout around, eavesdropping on conversations, and looking for valuables. When the time is ripe, they leave fully loaded, truly with the cleverness that no one knows and no ghost notices.</p>
<p>The chamber pot thief carries dry food with them, and also has a leather bag for urination and defecation. It is said that those who are experienced in this way can hide for five or seven days without difficulty, and even the worst can hide for two or three days.</p>
<p>Winter is approaching, which is the time for these guys to show off their skills. I can't help but remind everyone!</p>
<p>Scientific Knowledge</p>
<h3>New Fur</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>With a cold snap, ladies' fur coats are coming onto the market one after another.</p>
<p>Maybe you don't have a fur coat, go to the fur shop to take a look, want to buy one. Those made for tens of millions are unaffordable; you also feel "embarrassed by a poor purse" for sable and otter skins that cost several million, and you feel that cheap sheepskins and rat skins are "not up to your standards"!</p>
<p>Even if you are lucky enough to have a noble sable or otter skin coat, you also have many troubles at the same time, how to maintain its luster? How to avoid the invasion of rain and snow? Even how to keep it clean is a big problem.</p>
<p>These troubles and difficulties have been solved by a diligent Mexican scientist, Dr. J.B. Calva. He launched a "fur-making revolution," providing cheap, imitation, but practical fur goods, and also providing "fur insurance."</p>
<p>Calva was born in Puebla, Mexico forty-eight years ago, and graduated from the University of Mexico. In 1928, he obtained a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. The following year, he was hired by the school to do research work.</p>
<p>That year—the winter of 1929 was particularly cold, and Calva bought an otter skin coat to keep warm. In fact, this otter skin coat was a counterfeit, and it revealed its sheepskin origins after only a few days of wearing. Although Calva was fooled, it inspired him to launch a "fur-making revolution." After fifteen years of continuous research, Calva finally invented the "plastic method," which can transform a raw sheepskin into a noble fur that can resist snow erosion, is durable, and can be imitated in 36 hours.</p>
<p>Calva and his six assistants coordinate their own chemicals and design their own automatic machines. After a series of chemical washing, drying, trimming, polishing, and dyeing, two-thirds of the length of the wool fibers becomes permanent hairlike strands, and the remaining unchanged wool near the skin can increase the warmth of the fur.</p>
<p>After Calva succeeded, he submitted his "plastic fur" to the "Better Fabrics Testing Bureau" for testing. The bureau's report was: "These fibers can withstand the changes made to them and are durable for wearing." "The color, luster, softness, and texture of the plastic fur are not affected by rain, snow, or dry cleaning. It can be trampled on and completely soiled, and afterwards, it can be refreshed with a damp cloth."</p>
<p>Another feature of this "plastic fur" is that it can be dyed into various special colors. Red and wine colors are already on the market, and each coat sells for only 170 US dollars.</p>
<p>Calva said that with his fur-making method, he can also turn Chinese rat skins and Australian kangaroo skins, which some people "look down on," into sable-like furs. He also said that it is difficult to modify furs with unstable hair roots, so be careful when choosing raw skins, and the manufacturing process must also be careful. Applying Calva's "plastic method" can also make straight hair permanently curly. Genuine, noble furs such as sable and otter skins can be made more durable, retain their luster longer, and resist the erosion of rain and snow after being processed by this "plastic method." I hope that the people in our country who are engaged in the fur business can also rise up and pursue it, research and develop better fur manufacturing methods, so that fur becomes a common and durable winter product, and not just a noble decoration!

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in the year from the beginning of September last year to the end of August this year, a total of 29 county magistrates and 166 township heads in the province were accused of crimes, with corruption cases being the most numerous. Although there are still victims who dare not report, which cannot be statistically counted, this officially published figure is quite considerable.</p>
<p>I wonder about other provinces? I hope there is also a statistical figure.</p>

<h3>Yang Chuo'an by the Songhua River</h3>
<p>— Jinxia</p>
<p>Harbin Mayor is a famous city in Northeast China for cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, and has long had the title of "International City". Harbin is located on the Songhua River, with beautiful and pleasant scenery.</p>
<p>The current mayor of Harbin, Mr. Yang Chuo'an, is a model figure of a young man who overcomes hardship and achieves his goals. Mr. Yang visited Shanghai in June this year and met with reporters to answer their questions about the Northeast issue. Mr. Yang is middle-aged, with sparse hair, a full face, wearing glasses, and thin lips. His conversation shows his decisiveness and determination everywhere.</p>
<p>He is most opposed to the rigid official documents used in the Chinese bureaucracy. He said: "The so-called official document format is unprecedented in the world." He also criticized the ambiguous language in official documents, such as "conditionally approved" and "still feasible," believing that this is shirking responsibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang is from Hejian, 45 years old this year, and graduated from Beijing China-Russia College. During the war, he served as a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department.</p>
<p>It is said that in the 15th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Yang was only a "mail sorter" in the post office. His daily job was to sort and organize thousands of letters according to their destination. At that time, he was not very familiar with Western languages, so it took a lot of time to sort out the mail sent abroad, so he worked hard to study and used his spare time to tutor himself in English. Later, when a foreign postmaster asked him questions in English, he was able to answer fluently, which won him the favor of his superiors and he was sent abroad to study postal administration. After returning to China, he joined the party and entered politics, and everything went smoothly, creating his current position.</p>
<p>The current Harbin has been occupied by the Chinese Communist Party, which makes people wonder where the whereabouts of this mayor by the Songhua River are?</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 15</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>"Drawing Swords and Rising Up" Types</p>
<p>"Bao Xiang Da" (roughly translates to "Guaranteed Fighters") was originally a specialty of Shanghai "Baixiang Ren" (roughly translates to "White Elephant People," a term for local toughs or gangsters). During the rise of the Green and Red Gangs, the low-level members of these gangs were most fond of engaging in "righteous hero" acts of intervening in situations they perceived as unjust. They were fascinated by ancient knight-errant stories, and readily drew their swords to help, based on hearing only one side of the story. Although they disregarded the law, their intentions were not originally bad. However, the members of the Laodi Yuanxin Gang, seeing an opportunity, admired the demeanor of the Baixiang Ren for a long time and actually wanted to learn their ways. But they lacked the gang background of the Baixiang Ren. Coupled with the pressure of life, they had no choice but to take a crooked path to seek money. Thus, the "Baihu Shi" (roughly translates to "Displaying Tiger Power," a bluffing tactic) beggar gangs appeared. In their extreme boredom, they specialized in wandering the streets and alleys. Whenever trouble arose, they always aimed to profit from it. They gradually formed an organization of "Bao Xiang Da." As a result, they would fight on behalf of others as long as they were paid. Their actions were vastly different from the chivalrous Baixiang Ren. However, not just anyone could do this; they had to be "established" and have strong influence. Therefore, internally, they had to have a status of being "familiar faces" and "veterans." Externally, they had to be familiar with the authentic "Baixiang Ren" of various sections and gangs in order to be considered "well-connected" and be able to start this "Bao Xiang Da" business.</p>
<p>Taking Up Injustices on Behalf of Others</p>
<p>Shanghai originally had people from all over, making it difficult to manage, with good and bad mixed together. Especially in the lower classes, disputes and feuds arose daily, numbering dozens or hundreds. The beggar gangs had a network of informants spread throughout the streets and alleys. Once an alarm was raised, they would mobilize to participate, seeing it as a business opportunity. When disputes first arose, both sides would always try to assert their power, each going to extremes. These people would then intervene, taking up injustices on behalf of one side, strongly advocating for a tough stance, and volunteering to draw their swords to help. They would "zha tai xing" (roughly translates to "build a platform," meaning to save face) for the party involved. The party involved would naturally be deeply grateful. Thus, tensions would escalate, and the two sides would inevitably break apart. It would be necessary to "chi jiang cha" (roughly translates to "eat talking tea," a mediation session) and "jiang jin tou" (roughly translates to "discuss the details"). If the mediation resolved the dispute, the beggar gang members would get some benefit. If the negotiations broke down, a fierce fight would inevitably begin, and the "heroes" would be needed to risk their lives.</p>
<p>Before the prelude to the fighting, the beggar gang would gather troops for the party involved, determining the number based on the strength of the other side, ranging from dozens to hundreds. The gang had plenty of manpower anyway, and they could gather them with a single call. Before the fighting started, these people would make a verbal agreement with the party involved. They would stipulate how much "che fan pa" (roughly translates to "meal money") each person would receive, and how much compensation would be paid for each person who was "gua cai" (injured), "dao zhao" (killed), or "zhai zhan lao" (arrested) after the fighting started. All of this had to be stated in advance. The leader of the beggar gang would often take more than half of this meal money and compensation. After a fight, the police would definitely search everywhere, so the beggars who had been involved would have to temporarily "avoid the limelight." This expense also had to be demanded from the party involved.</p>
<p>Profiting from the Situation</p>
<p>However, "the world is getting more sophisticated," and the "Bao Xiang Da" of the beggar gangs became increasingly cunning. They often "xu zhang hu shi" (roughly translates to "feign tiger power") to win the favor of the party involved. They would see that the two sides were full of murderous intent and that a war was about to break out, but in the end, it often didn't break out. Only one in ten cases would actually result in a full-scale fight, because the beggar gangs were focused on money, not fighting. After all, no one wants to risk their life for someone else. Therefore, during the mediation, if the other party was a brother from the same gang, it would naturally be easy to resolve the dispute with a few words. If the other party was an authentic "Baixiang Ren" with more influence, they could also bring out a "old friend" with face to mediate and resolve the matter peacefully as a last resort. But the party involved would still be fiercely assertive and unwilling to back down, so the reward money would be overdrawn. After the money they could get was in hand, they would suddenly withdraw their troops without ever having fought. "Generals abroad are not bound by the orders of the sovereign," leaving the party involved with financial loss and resentment, regretting their initial decision. But they couldn't report it to the authorities or complain, truly making it a grievance that could not be redressed!</p>
<p>Weekend Chat</p>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<h3>University Entrance Exam Questions</h3>
<p>I happened to hear a few friends talking about the Chinese language test questions for this year's Nanjing Higher Civil Service Examination and the Zhejiang Provincial County Magistrate Examination. I really feel sorry for the test takers who are transitioning from school to society. We will leave aside whether the topics such as "Explaining 'Good Teaching Gains the People' and 'Seeing Quality and Thinking of Qi'" and "Expand on the Meaning of 'Duke Zhou's Six Affairs, Only Integrity is Tested'" still have some elements of the "eight-legged essay" style. However, the disconnect between the current examination system and the education system is worth criticizing. Nowadays, middle school students' energy is completely consumed in the balanced development of social sciences and natural sciences, and in university, they have to cope with many complex and novel specialized academic studies. The improvement of Chinese studies is fundamentally a matter of having the will but lacking the strength. Therefore, testing by forcing them to write about the classics and historical schools is no different from making fun of young people. If the examination system is merely a tool for decorating education or merely covers new souls with a layer of old shells, this is the tragedy of our generation and a loss for the country. What does the authorities think?</p>
<h3>Times Have Changed</h3>
<p>I heard that ××× has already bought a foreign house and a car in the United States and is preparing to live his remaining years in leisure, not caring about promotions or demotions. General × spent half his life in the military, starting with cotton-padded clothes and straw sandals, and earned this little bit of a foreign house and a car today. Compared to those corrupt officials who suck the people's blood and enjoy themselves, this path of retiring after success and enjoying his old age is really worthy of our praise. However, we have some feelings about this: ××× is known as a Christian General. Christianity is originally a religion that is "salvation of the world" oriented; but looking at the current situation of war and chaos, it seems that Christianity has become "salvation of oneself" first. The Jing'an Temple's dispute over temple property and the Baiyun Temple's burning of the Taoist priests, all religions have fallen into the "Small Vehicle." It's no wonder that the general converted to Christianity, and of course, laid down his butcher knife, moved his house to the west, saving himself from the sea of suffering before the people.</p>
<h3>"Prices Are Crawling Down, Business Is Rising Up."</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>I happened to pass by Linsen Middle Road and saw a department store with a large sign that said: "Prices are crawling down, business is rising up." I couldn't help but feel happy, thinking that we would soon be able to restore the old peaceful days.</p>
<p>I went inside and looked around for a week. American goods accounted for more than 95% of the items on display. Turning around and going out the door, I saw the huge red sign again and was shocked.</p>
