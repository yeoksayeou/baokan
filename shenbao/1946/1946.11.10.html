<p>〔本報南京九日電〕九日上午十時，民盟·靑年黨·及社會賢達人士，在交行集議討論主席八日之聲明，內有關國大及憲草問題。中午全體赴武夷路應孫科午宴，計出席者政府全體代表，民盟·靑年黨·社會賢達在京代表，共黨周恩來·鄧頴超·李維漢，餐後舉行非正式綜合會談，司徒暨傳涇波亦應邀前往。大使在會中，曾表示勉勵之意，略稱：今日各方首次聚談，應從建設方面着想，最好不要意氣用事。會後據孫科負責聲明：對三人小組，非正式五人小組，政協綜合小組，政協憲草審議會，均可照開，在野各方均表贊同，惟對國大開會日期，希政府予以考慮。下午五時民盟·靑年黨等在交行再度集議，研討促進各種會議之順利進行方法。又周恩來在孫寓會中，曾表示對國大意見，認爲必須經過各方面協議。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕羅隆基·左舜主·繆嘉銘，九日晚訪周恩來，旋張申府等於八時半訪孫科，至十時半返藍家莊。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕共產黨代表團王炳南，九日上午十一時赴美大使館對主席八日聲明之意見有所說明，談半小時辭出。又馬特使今晨會囑柯艾上校，携函送至共產黨代表團，內容未悉。對於政府八日所頒停戰令一事，記者於今晚詢共產黨發言人，據稱：事先未接獲任何通知，事後亦無所悉。共產黨之作戰全係自衛，故無須下停戰令即將停止。惟關於停戰一事，周恩來將於日內訪罵特使晤談。關於共產黨答覆蔣主席八項意見之復函內容，甚簡單，僅稱，若千問題早在滬與吳邵兩氏談過，並稱，主席八點意見，應以談判爲基礎一節，共產黨意見早由周氏面吿矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕司徒今晨接見王炳南後，十二時偕傳涇波訪馬特使晤談，並同午餐。聞曾轉吿共產黨對主席八日驟明中之意見，二時許赴孫科寓邸，談話約一刻鐘，即返使館。並於四時半接見中和黨尤永昌談半小時。</p>

<p>〔本報北平九日電〕行轅發言人九日吿記者，蔣主席昨頒布之停戰令，行轅已收到，並已嚴令各地部隊邀令執行。記者詢以倘國軍受到攻擎如何處置，發言人請示王參謀長鴻詔後答稱；停戰命令要執行，但國軍將不挨打。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕主席八日所頒停戰令，此間數家報紙，常晚十時以後會發號外，使山城凄風鑼雨中沉重不安之人心，頓覺輕減？重慶行轅則於九日午奉到停戰令，當即轉知所屬切實執行</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江九日電〕聞蘇省軍政富局奉到蔣主席停戰手令後，已急電蘇北前綫各部隊長及各地方行政當局遵令辦理，並聞向鹽城推進之國軍，將止於劉莊，靜待復命，一般預測，如鹽阜共軍不再乘機偸襲國軍，蘇北戰局可望緩和。</p>

<p>〔本報北平九日電〕民盟秘書長梁漱溟，九日於其北平私邸接見記者稱：政府頒布停戰令後時局有可能好轉，但亦有可能更趨僵化，而不易解決。因政府頒布此次文吿，一切皆成定型，不易轉園，停戰自然是一件好事，但是在政府文吿裏，講到許多政治問題，如國大保留各黨派名額及憲法問題，都與政協決議不合，一定要成問題。記者詢以政府旣明令停戰，共軍是否亦可能停戰，梁答：這要看共黨如何決定自己的政策了。梁並稱：周恩來前曾主張召開軍事三人小組會，現在政府在這種條件下，宣布召開軍事三人會了，共黨是否參加，將成爲周恩來煞費思索的一個難題。</p>
<h3>張君勱談話</h3>
<p>盼消除衝突基本原因</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕張君勱對主席所頒停戰令，發表談話，謂今日之停戰令，實爲各方滿意之要求，惟停止働突命令雖下，尤須進一步以求衝突基本原因之消除暨如何消除衝突原因之辦法。此項辦法，在政治方面已有各方擁護之政協五項決議，在軍事方面，已有兩點簽訂之整編方案，仍希望兩點與各黨派不折不扣以求其實現、奠定和平基礎，以慰全國人民之望。</p>
<h3>葉劍英談話</h3>
<p>共軍不受停戰令拘束</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕蔣主席頒發停戰令後，記者九日晨趨訪軍調部共黨委員葉劍英，首問刻政府已頒停戰令，共黨之行動是否亦將受此項停戰令之拘束，葉答不受拘束。並稱：政府旣解釋過去軍事行動爲自衛，將來如有必要，仍將繼續自衛，如此則道條路不是和平之路，而是戰爭之路。記者問，在目前情形下，南京和平談判是否將繼續進行，葉答：要南京會外商談有無發展而定，截至上午，葉氏尙未接到南京周恩來及延安方面之指示。軍調部方面亦未接到新任務，九日上午葉氏正與其高級僚屬研究蔣主席停戰文吿。</p>

<p>記者團於張垣勾留二日，十一月二日下午四時飛扺被圍攻四十五日之大同，楚溪　總司令及大同黨政各界首長與學生，民衆共二千餘人列隊機塲歡迎，情緒熱烈眞　。大同於八月三日起被圍，共軍姚喆，蕭克，賀龍，聶榮臻四將採車輪戰法，圍攻守軍，歷久不下，最後施放催淚性毒瓦斯彈，始佔城郊據點，惟終未能突入城內。集寗收復後，共軍後路已斷，軍心動搖，大同守軍乘勢變動反攻，於九月十六日解圍。被圍期間，軍民協力同心，視死如歸，堅强不屈，不乏可歌可泣故事。共軍敗退時，將規模爲華北第一之平旺發電廠澈底破壞，大同八煤礦，日可產煤八千噸，供應華北各地需要，遭破壞後，日僅產煤七百噸，記者等親往一一憑弔，浩嘆不已！當歸大同途中，爲數三百以上之礦工與其家屬，突向記者專卓跪下，痛訴受災情况，共軍淸算。鬥爭種種暴行，與彼等面臨生活之懸崖，聲淚俱下。</p>
<p>記者團四日未成行，五日乘平綏路專車赴集密視察，並候北平派機來接，集寗已在塞外，地勢高於張垣，大同，歸綏。朔風凜冽，白雪飄飄，已是嚴冬氣象，歷經災難之人民，三五成羣，向記者陳訴彼等之痛苦，彼等於共黨竊踞一年內所受損失，較日軍盤踞八年中所受損失允有過之，善後救濟，實迫不及待。</p>
<p>記者團在集寗候機二日，氣候仍來轉好，七日晚又乘平綏路專車改赴歸綏候機，該地之氣候較集寗爲佳，中途火草出軌，可謂多磨。九日最於歸綏搭機轉入大同返京，總計此行共歷十日，較原定日程超出一倍半，收穫材料至爲豐富，視察結果，共黨殘暴之眞而目，經由中外記者團面暴露於全世界矣！</p>

<p>陳樹人致詞</p>
<p>繼由陳委員長樹人致詞稱：華僑與祖國關係素極密切，對祖國之革命抗戰貢獻殊大，今後建國工作，倚重允多，希多理解國情，投資國內經濟建設，改良產銷制度，擴充海外市塲，請就此充分發表意見。旋各部代表致詞及各地僑領先後發言，主要內容可歸納爲下列數點：（一）保僑：各地僑胞生命財產不能受充分保障，乃最嚴重之經濟問題，此爲使僑胞向國內投資之先決條件，政府應特別予以沈意。（二）僑匯：海外各地政府多限制僑匯，而海外祖國銀行復員遲緩，僑胞匯款極感不便，希政府設法改善此種情况，便利資金返國。（三）航運：國內外航運事業不發達，運費外溢，而貨運不暢，應統籌計劃投資發展內河及外洋航運。　華僑復員貸款應迅速實現，並力求公允。（五）改良國貨品質，普遍推銷宣傳，以爭取海外市塲。</p>
<p>陳立夫談話</p>
<p>至下午一時，全體共進午餐，席間陳立夫蒞臨，並即席發表「中國目前經濟問題」之談話稱：國內經濟情形嚴重，主要癓結有二：（一）通貨收縮及於生產資本。關於法幣之發行，因恐通貨膨脹，乃拼命收縮，此種設施，並非不正確，然須注意不能收縮，生產方面之通貨，否則生產受限，物資减少，物價自然高漲，仍無補於事。（二）銀行政策不合國情。目前金融界怪現象，爲資產不能變爲活動資金，僅原料可抵押借款，此蓋我國銀行政策乃承認列强殖民地銀行制度下之政策，工業在此種銀行制度下，存款者希圖高利，私人銀行利用投機工業，投資人人畏却，生產勢必停頓，故目前經濟情形嚴重，原因並非任何產業者之咎，亦不能盡責共黨之割據，欲求解決之道，唯有自根本改造銀行制度與政策及嚴格分辨生產資本與多餘通貨入手。余曾以此意見陳諸宋院長，敢信財經當局如能用大力醫除經濟病根，根絕殖民者遺毒，必可解決目前最嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>餐後，繼續開會，討論僑委會所提五項議題，及潘序倫所提議案，均經原則通過。最後周啓剛氏作一總結，對各與會僑領之貢獻寳貴意見深致謝意，僑委會及經濟部將盡量採納，以與各有關機關磋商，迅遠解除僑胞痛苦。至四時許散會。</p>

<h3>停戰令頒發後</h3>
<p>全國人民欣聞　蔣主席頒發停止軍事衝突命令之後，莫不認爲時局自此即有開朗的希望；同時對於中共的反響如何，尤爲關切。大家終以爲中共對於政府的一再忍讓，決不能無動於中；但是中共發言人仍稱：『國民黨政府單方面所宣佈之「停止其他軍事行動」，事前既未與共產黨代表協商，而將「爲防守現地所必需」的除外，仍可作一切軍事行動的藉口，至政治方面所提之一切辦法，均與政協決議及其程序相遠背，因此談判前途，實未容樂觀。」這一番談話實在使全國人民有些費解。中共的論調，不僅不能自圓其說，而且中共對於和談仍未開誠相見，泯除一切疑忌，實在太使我們渴望和平的老百姓失望了。惟今後時局的發展，因爲政府已盡了忍讓的能事，且已到了無可再忍無可再讓的地步；唯有視中共的態度如何而定。吾人爲國家民族的前途計，同時也爲中北的前途着想，猶希望中共臨崖勒馬，時機雖已迫切，但尙有四十八小時，我們在這四十八小時內，仍翹望南京，時時刻刻在這裏期待着巾共蟠然覺悟的好消息。</p>
<p>緣自日寇屈膝投降以來，已逾一年有餘，我國匪特朱能把握時機，理頭建國工作，使國家走上光明的坦途；反而爲了國共問題，未能渡過復員時期而走上復興的然段，光陰慮　，磋跎復蹉跎，實在太可惜了。全國人民固莫不渴望國內和平統一的實現，政府更是迫切企求和平，企求統一，但是一年餘來的和平商談，好比是一個惡夢，人人都盼望中共迅連從這個惡夢中醒過來。過去的利談情形，姑置不論，且再回溯最近一個月來的大局演變，眞可以說奇峯突起，波瀾縱橫了。</p>
<p>中共於九月三十日發表聲明，要求政府停止對張家口所有的一切軍事行動，否則即認爲和談已經破裂，不願再繼續舉行。中共的備忘錄雖帶有最後通牃的性質，但是政府仍表示忍讓，對於解決時局，提出兩項意見，主張三人會議與五人小組同時開會，俾使改組國府與停戰辦法兩項重要問題，得於同時解決。但是中共對此一再拖延，置之不理，而由延安廣播電台發表中共的要求，即要求國軍退出本年一月十三日以後所收復的地區，否則中共即不參加改組政府的談判，而將作戰到底。中共抱着這種態度，匪特使全國渴望和平的老百姓爲之焦慮，就是在友邦調人馬帥及司徒大使，也深感不安。可是馬帥仍本着百折不撓的精神，把「死馬當作活馬醫」，又向雙方建議，張家口停戰十天，政府首先表示同意，而中共始終拒絕，並攻擊馬帥及司徒大使的偏袒政府，謂其替政府作緩兵之計。因此和談迫近絕壁，幾乎無法打開僵局。幸賴蔣主席於國慶日發表廣播演說，表示政府一本政治解決的願望，始終期望開誠協商，使這和談之門，依然洞開。翌日國軍收復張家口，同時政府又頒佈如期召開國民大會的命令，頓使時局急轉直下，步入一新階段。所謂「第三方面的代表」及社會賢達，鑒於時局的緊張，亦出來奔走和平，調處雙方的意見，務使和談重開。　蔣主席又於十月十六日發表文吿，對於處理目前時局提出八項辦法，開明公允，爲全國人民一致所擁護，使逗留滬上的中共代表，也不得不於十月廿一日晨晋京，恢復和平商談，又使國人燃起一綫希望，相信時局從此必能開朗。可是中共又堅持兩項條件，使和談仍相持於「八點」與「兩條」之爭。而中共對於政府八點，始終未予答覆，直至前晚中共覆文始由周恩來請馬帥轉交政府代表，至其內容如何，猶所米悉。</p>
<p>從道一段和談的經過看來，中共的態度始終不定，其所根據的論據，也不免前後矛盾，例如中共要求停戰，由來已久；現在政府自動無條件的下令停戰了，照理中共不僅要表示歡迎，而且還要繼政府之後也下令停戰的；但是中共却說什麼政府單方面宣佈停戰令，不僅表示不願下令停戰，而且還要反對政府下令停戰。這種自相矛盾的說法，徒使國人明瞭中共的居心。所謂事實勝於雄辯，中共如此出乎爾，反乎爾，此後中共再有什麼聲明，不論其所採取之宣傳方式如何高明，將難以令人民信服，何待多言。</p>
<p>至於所謂「第三方面」，在最近的一個月之中，爲和平而奔走，的確費了一番心血，値得我們欽佩的，但是觀於民主同盟方面若干代表對於政府頒佈停戰令所發表的童見，仍與中共一鼻孔出氣，實在使我們可惜，賢明如此等代表，倘亦是非不明，黑白不分，何能免於盲目跟跑之嫌？我們希望各方能以國家民族爲重，一本大公無私的精神繼續努力勸吿中共也下令停戰，並提出國民大會代表名單，務使全國各地的代表暨各黨派的代表，均能於國父誕辰，聚首一堂。從長議計國家的根本大法，爲國家的百年大計，奠定一個鞏固的基礎。</p>
<h3>全國工業協會開幕</h3>
<p>中國全國工業協會勝利後首决全國代表大會於一昨召開於首都；此會任務，據報載消息，在檢討目前工業困難，計劃將來經建工作。日前全國商會聯合會大會正在首都閉幕，如今又緊接著全國工業協會大會的召開，這眞可以表示全國工商業深知團結的必要，以謀工商業的改進，實在是一件可慶幸的事。</p>
<p>講到中國工業，設備陳陳舊，技術落後，與工業先進的國家自不能比擬；但就是我們這點幼稚的工業，在抗戰時期，亦會對國家民族有極大的貢獻。中國工廠的內移，在我國抗戰歷史上是一宗可歌可泣的故事。在內地艱苦的情形下，處境的困難到了萬分，然而我國幼稚的民族工業，却支持了國家八年的長期抗戰。凡此精神，實在値得我們的敬仰。</p>
<p>如今抗戰勝利也有一年多了，而中國工業所遭逢到的危難，却更甚於戰時。高利貸的盛行，廉價舶來品的大量輸入，原料電力供應的困難，生產成本的續續增高，而生產效率郤相反地續續下降，以及運輸的迄未暢復都使中國工業陷於極艱苦的境地。在從前抗戰時代所希望的，如今不但未曾實現；，其處境郤更較戰時爲困難。這種情勢當然不能讓它持續下去；現在工廠因不堪虧蝕而倒閉停業者，時有所聞。如何及時挽救這種頹勢，使民族工業轉趨活潑，實爲政府當務之急。從消極方面霄，康價舶來品的天量輸入，威脅我民族工業的生存。政府雖於徵收關稅之中，寓有保護我幼稚的民族工業之意；然其效不彰，直到今日，市上廉價舶來品觸目皆是。際此幣制尙未開始整理之際，如何能有效管制輸入，端爲挽救我民族工業的要圖。高利貸的流行，使工業資金周轉爲難。故從積極方面言，政府應充分給予中國工業以信用上的便利，如擴大工貸范圍及數量等就是，庶幾中國幼稚的民族工業得不致枯竭衰落。凡此種種，均爲政府權力可得而爲者，玫府自應予以援助。</p>
<p>至於對於中國整個的工業化，不但應該有縝密的計劃，尤貴乎及時的實施‘目前橫置在中國工業界的有所謂國營與民營的問題；按諸實際，這不應該被認爲問題而被提出討論。按照我建國的最高指導原則，重工業國營，經工業民常乃爲旣定的方針，界限分明。不容含混，中國所有的這一點民族工業主要的就是輕工業，民生日用品工業，亦即所謂生產直接消費品的工業，本屬於民營的範疇，國家原沒有取締禁止之意。此在以民主前進自居的　　爲絕對不可能的事。蘇聯的迭次五年計劃以重工業，亦即軍需工業爲中心；到今天，蘇聯的人民。還沒有充分可供直接　　的生產品。目前我國的情形雖並不完全如我們的理想，但我國的工業界應該有一點必要的認識，就是只有在以三民主義爲建國的最高指導原則下，中國民族工業現有的這一點基礎，　能有它們的將來。</p>

<h3>四外長連日會議無成果　特港問題會外談判　南斯拉夫表示願與西方國家修好</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕此間西方强國外交家今日談稱：如義大利及南斯拉夫能自行覓取新辦法，解決特里埃斯特港問題，則四國外長會議可即放棄其國際共管特港計劃。四國外長今日會議四小時又四十分，當議決擱置特港問題，而進行討論義大利及羅馬尼亞和的。關於羅馬尼亞和的中多瑙河航行條款，討論一無結果。蘇外長莫洛托夫反對將此條款加入和的之內，但又表示願單獨加以討論，英外長貝文則稱，多瑙河自由通航一點，不論其由和約或任何其他方式予以保證，均無關係，惟英國作戰最久，殊不欲犧牲其在戰論所有之各項權利。美國務卿貝爾納斯支持貝文意見。九日與十日適逢週末，並無正式會議，以便各代表非正式商談。同時貝爾納斯國務卿則預備觀看大規模之足球比賽。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電〕四強外長今夜以緊急動議，決定將特港問題無限期延緩討論，衆信關於此項嚴重問題，可能在會外進行非公開談判。上項建議係由貝爾納斯在今日第四次外長集會時提出者。貝氏於提出此頃動議前一日，曾與南斯拉夫外長薛米克及南斯拉夫駐美大使卡薩諾維契晤談，同時在南斯拉夫蒂托元帥宣佈以特港交換戈里齊亞以後亦僅一日。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約八日電〕南斯拉夫外長薛米克今日在此晤英外相貝文時，曾表示南國願與西方國家修好，滿意解決特港及南義疆界問題，以消滅永久摩擦原因之志願。權威方面謂薛米克並未提出南國最近所提以戈里齊亞交換特港之新建議。昨日渠與美國務卿貝爾納斯晤談時，亦未提及此一建議，可證紐約之南國代表團確未奉有訓令，向外長會議提出此事。又悉，代表法外長皮杜爾之繆維爾，今晨亦曾晤南外長薛米克及義駐美代表加朗地尼，想薛米克亦未正式提出蒂托元帥最近之新建議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕此間外交家鑒於近來各方面種種發展，咸揣揣久陷僵局之特港問題，可能獲得解決。南斯拉夫外長薛米克曾偕南國駐美大使往訪美國務卿貝爾納斯會商，內容不詳，但外交界人士則認爲或係討論特港問題。據此間熟悉外長會議情形者談稱，南國代表週三在外長會議中所發表有關特港問題之聲明，措詞比較溫和，輿論對之仍極重視，其語氣與在巴黎時南代表團因特港問題而退出和會之情形截然不同。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比京八日電〕比利時通訊社宣在：盧森堡國大公已要求四外長會議，批准盧國與德國之東部邊境。聞盧森堡要求修改摩寒爾與索默河區域邊界。</p>
<h3>蒂托新建議用意　不願使特港受英美控制</h3>
<p>〔路透社特里埃斯特八日電〕特港共黨報紙載有「特港義大利—斯洛文納反法西斯聯盟」秘書長巴比克之談話，指責英美擬用利特港，作爲帝國主義侵略基地，以抗義南兩國民主勢力及東歐所有民主勢力之發展。蒂托元帥之新建議，使義國保留特港，而由南國取得戈里齊亞，可使帝國主義者無從利用南義之爭，而坐收漁翁之利云。按此爲南國人士對蒂托新建議之首次評論，可證蒂托政府寗願戰敗之義國保留特港，而不願便聯合國機構控制該地。此間親蒂托派人士復非正式聲稱，彼等相信蒂托建議由義國保留特港，所附條件有特港區爲非武裝區，並依據「義大利—斯洛文納反汰西斯聯盟」前此所提十點建議，在該區設立民主政權等項。此外，南國或許更要求將特港以西至蒙法爾貢爲止之沿海地帶讓與南國，果爾，將使特港成爲南國土地內之一義大利孤島而已。維尼齊亞求里亞之義民族解放委員會刻已發表公報，響應羅馬政府之拒絕蒂托新建議。</p>
<h3>聯國救濟物資應適當分配　我要求</h3>

<p>〔本報特寫〕「我要回到中國去！我要死在中國！」中國的摯友，中國的首席客鄉端納先生，今年春天，在太平洋的塔希蒂島上，經醫生那裏知道他的「藥石罔效」的命運以後，毫不躊躇地決定了他最後的意志。</p>
<p>今天，端納先生達到了他的志願，他將在中國的地下安逸地長眠，有中國的青草玉露舖洒在他的頭邊。</p>
<p>七十一歲的端納，他一生的目的，祗爲着兩個字——「真理」。今年三月十八日，端納先生經檀香山來到上海後，居住在宏恩醫院三樓一間幽靜的病房內。新春的陽光從窗縫中偷偷地照在他的床邊，端納先生兩眼釘在這幾綫光明上，對記者說：「人們不但要知道「真理」，而且要尋求「真理」，更要爲着「真理」而奮鬥。」</p>
<p>四十四年來，端納先生爲着中國，爲着人類奮鬥，努力，受苦，爲的是要達到他人生的目的。</p>
<p>少年時代</p>
<p>一八七五年六月二十日，端納誕生在澳洲新南威爾斯（New　South　Wales）一個小城市的大家庭內。父親是一個鐵路上的包工，希望兒子也做一個鐵路上的工程師。可是端納却決心鵒新聞事業。也許是命運注定，也許是不幸，端納在幼時與小朋友玩耍時，跌傷了手臂，從此他不能再打鐵修機器。在十五六歲的時候，進了一個印刷所做排字員。不久，他在一家報館內當了新聞記者。</p>
<p>日俄戰後由港來滬　總理聘爲英文秘書</p>
<p>一九〇二年，香港英人所辦的「中國郵報」正想大事發展，可是總編輯終日愁眉不展，焦急萬分，原來他找不到好記者。用到的記者，沒有一個不沉醉杯中物。沒有辦法，總編輯祇能派人到澳洲去物色人才。選中的角色就是端納。如此，他來到中國，把偉大的功績帶給中國。</p>
<p>端納沒有使「中國郵報」總編輯失望，更沒有使他自己失望。他踏上了成功的大道。「中國郵報」從此一天天發達起來，成爲香港第一大報。一九〇五年，日俄開戰，端納代表紐約論壇報担任戰地記者。戰爭結束，他加入上海英文遠東評論撰著論文。當時遠東評論主筆雷氏與孫總理是摯友，在偶然的機會中，雷氏把端納介紹給孫總理。總理喜獲這樣一位對中國政治有極大興趣，革命思想異常誠真的朋友，就留聘他爲英文秘書。端納不但幫助總理，幫助中國，並且幫助全世界。他帶着革命的精神奔走港，滬，外洋，發揚革命運動，使外僑和中國人自己對當前的局勢，得到一個正確的和新的認識。</p>
<p>中國政治舞台上　四十年客鄉生涯</p>
<p>從此，端納開始了他的客鄉生涯，在中國四十年的政治舞台上，每一幕的變動，都有他的貢獻，他的功績。我國歷史上的幾件大事如討袁，中國參加第一次歐戰，北伐時遊說張作霖投誠，以至西安事變等，他曾直接或間接的參與其事。而最大的努力，是他將日本所提的廿一條，首先以新聞報導的方式公佈於世，而使全世界各國洞穿日寇的併吞中國的野心。</p>
<p>一九二八年，端納經人介紹與張學良見面，任他爲顧問。張少帥得此賢師，非常器重他，而從他那裏，獲得了深一層的政治認識與國家思　。在這時期，他說服了張氏父子，間接的協助了北伐的成功。一九三〇年，東北易幟以後，端納陪同張學良旅行歐洲。由於他的真誠人格的感應，一度紙醉金迷的少帥，就脫離了黑籍。</p>
<p>中國人民都應感謝的一件事</p>
<p>當端納和總理相處之時，得到機會和宋氏姊妹熟識。「端納叔叔」在宋氏姊妹的印象中，始終是可敬可親。一九三四年，端納從歐洲回國，就由蔣夫人介紹給主席。主席睿智賢明的理政精神，使端納大爲感動，使他敢於直言不諱大胆貢陳意見，把歐美各國的政治思想介紹給主席。西安事變發生，端納自告奮勇，堅持着北上爲主席效勞。是年十二月二十五日，主席安然脫險，成爲中國近代政治史上一大轉捩點。這自然是主席德威有以致之，但端納奮不顧身的功績，也是值得我們每個中國人民感謝的。</p>
<p>歲月易逝，端納感到暮景漸近，須要安息了。一九三九年，他到了香港，特造了一艘船，開始他的旅行生涯。在太平洋上的島嶼間，海闊天空，端納享受着他世外桃源悠閒的晚年。但是他想起了一件未完的工作——還要寫一篇詳細的回憶錄。當他回到塔希蒂島以後，他却又無法執筆。因爲他知道在這政治動盪的時代中，他的歷史性，政治性的記述，偶一不慎，就會影響大局。所以他一時未敢輕易下筆。</p>
<p>集中營裏未被識破</p>
<p>在端納退休的數年中，主席夫婦時刻在懷念着他，希望他依舊歸來。端納也忘不了中國，所以在一九四一年冬，他決定西返。不幸到達馬尼刺時，珍珠港事發，端納成了敵人的聖太湯麥士（Sanra　Thomas）集中營的一名俘虜。在集中營裏，敵人祇知道有一個老年的退休商人，名呌端納，並未知道他的底細。經過數次的緊張驚險塲合，端納僥倖未被識破。而遠在重慶的主席夫婦則早悉此事，日夜焦慮。一待菲列賓解放，立即與美軍當局商洽，派傘兵前去營救。當他第三次回到塔希蒂島舊居時，端納先生體力已不支，比前减輕了四十磅。經主席請美海軍專機送到美國診視，發現他得到了一個可怕的疾病——癌。然而，端納先生並不畏懼，他視死如歸，只要求回到他的第二故鄉——中國。當他初抵上海時候，醫師曾說過他祇能在世間二個月，但經過小心的診治，慶幸端納竟能多帶給我們六個月的溫暖。他在病中也依然振起精神，天天看書讀報，和幾位知己的友好漫談天下事。</p>
<p>孫總理給他的一枚勳章　認爲生平最珍視的寶藏</p>
<p>病中，他時時記掛着蔣主席，蔣夫人。臨終前二日，雖然他已不能再作言語，可是他不願意在未見到蔣夫人前瞑目。蔣主席這次經台灣特地趕來探望他。蔣夫人在他臨終前和他見了最後一面，端納向她點頭微笑，他滿足了。他將永遠含笑九泉之下。</p>
<p>端納沒有遺產，沒有遺物。他早年就離開家庭，和他夫人分居。膝下僅有一位女兒，現在澳洲。他生平認爲最寶貴的一件寶藏，就是當年孫總理送給他的一枚勳章。端納先生是「真理」的代表，他不願意遷就環境，他不怕惡勢力的威脅。同時他也是一個堅毅剛强的人，經他四十多年在中國而終不吃中國飯一點，就可知道他剛直堅强的意志。</p>
<p>長眠吧，中國的摯友！今日在萬國殯儀館憑弔端氏的人們，都會深刻的記起他平生依爲座右銘的箴言：「人們不但要知道「真理」，而且要尋求「真理」，更要爲着「真理」而奮鬥」。</p>

<h3>滬審理漢奸案件　執行死刑第一名　梁逆鴻志昨槍決　遺書二通猶謂從政失敗死不甘服　臨弄神態泰然一彈畢命</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞維新政府首腦梁鴻志已於昨日下午一時廿二分，在上海監獄刑塲內執行槍決。此爲勝利後本市審理漢奸被判死刑執行之第一名。</p>
<p>按梁自經本市高院判處死刑後，即由其家屬延請辯護律師具狀最高法院，申請覆判。後經最高法院裁定維持原判。昨最高檢處突接南京最高檢察處執行命令，即於十一時四十分，由載榮　檢察官簽發提票，往忠監二十三號囚房將梁提出，押往該獄附設之用塲。梁身衣黑呢長袍，藍綢紥脚管褲，紫醬色麻紗襪，白底黑直實呢鞋，面色白胖，態度白若。戴檢察官率同法警蒞臨刑塲，時在十一時五十分。騐明正身後，即詢以有無遺言。梁答稱尙未接到最高法院判決書，何以遽加執行。言下似有不服之意。戴檢察官常吿以係奉上峯命令，梁聞言面色略現灰白，但仍極鎭靜。當請求死後通知家屬，並索紙筆寫遺書，由十二時開始至一時十五分始畢，共寫十行紙三張，致其家屬書巾略稱：余生平讀詩書，而今從政失敗，今日死於極刑，得訊即來收屍，吾家貧寒，殯殮不必舖張。今後尙望節儉省用云。另上蔣主席一書猶爲己辯稱：出組僞府並非圖一已名利，而係欲救人民於水火，與一般政治家之理想相同。今因失敗而被判死刑，實難甘服云云。執筆時神態泰然，不露慌張之色。書畢猶囑托將掛錶一只及衣服等物轉交其家屬。並自袋中摸出玉魚一只，長約三吋係象牙與玉石合鑲。聲稱此爲先師遺物，囑轉交家屬，作殉葬之用。言畢即步前坐於一黃色靠背木椅上，爲一時二十分，載撿察官一聲令下，一時二十二分即由法警王駿驊在梁背後開放一槍，彈自後腦進，前口出，立即倒於椅之左側，仆地氣絕，右眼緊閉，左眼突出，八字眉倒掛，鮮血不住從口部槍洞湧出。經戴檢察官騐明無誤後，法警覆以草綠色美軍用毯，但赤血猶滲透此厚毯。事畢，高檢處通知其家屬收殮，一面即在上海監獄門口公吿示衆。三時由普善山莊將屍裝入薄板棺材內，送往膠州路騐屍所，傍晚其家屬得訊趕往，當將屍身運往中國殯儀館暫厝候殮。</p>
<h3>最高法院判決書　被告詆毀中央破壞團體　非處極刑不足以昭烱戒</h3>
<p>按梁現年六十四歲，福建長樂人。最高法院之判決書中列舉梁之犯罪事實稱：被吿初在北京政府任國務院參事，參議院議員，執政府秘書長等職。至國軍北伐成功，奠都南京後，息影杭州。民國二十六年抗戰初起時，移居上海。厥後，京滬相繼淪陷，政府遷都重慶，被吿乘此時機糾同溫宗堯陳錦濤陳籙等向敵通款，籌設華中僞政權。於廿七年三月廿八日在京成立僞維新政府發表宣言，設置兩院八部，統轄三省兩市。自任偽行政院長，總攬一切，改用五色國旗</p>
<p>主持議政會，招募軍隊，攫奪海關，並陸續與敵酋簽訂鐵路電信鹽務，銀行協定。與敵人同營華中鐵道，電無，通信，鹽業，輪船等公司，及華興銀行。復與華北僞臨時政府首領王逆克敏會商於廿七年九月間成立僞中華政府聯合委員會，共同發表宣言。同年十一月問東渡訪問敵方軍政首要人物，以資聯絡。歸國後發表訪日感想，迨廿八年四月汪逆兆銘背叛黨國，潛來上海，籌組僞國民政府，被吿與汪王兩逆數度磋商後，即於同年九月廿一日廿三日，先後以僞維新臨時兩政府名義，共同發表宣言，響應汪逆</p>
<p>主張之和平運動。翌年一月間在靑島開會，共同決定組織僞中央政治會議，三月二十日又開會於南京，議決中日關係調整案。及僞國民政府在首都正式成立，共同發表所謂還都之宣言並偽國府政綱。同時偽維新臨時兩政府宣言解散，被吿改任偽監察院院長兼偽中政會委員。至卅三年十一月二十日，因在逆病故，陳逆公博繼任僞國民政府主席，被吿乃接充偽立法院長，至日寇投降爲止。</p>
<h3>駁斥覆判理由</h3>
<p>最高法院駁斥梁逆聲請覆判之理由中稱：査被吿果有救國救民之熱忱而抱絕大犧牲之決心，雖不能荷戈殺敵，亦何難潛入後方效命中央以堅强抗戰建國之力量。抑或身隱林泉，遵時養晦，靜待勝利之來臨。乃明明有中央之抗戰決策而必欲組織僞政府以推行敵寇之政策，明明有我國領袖之主持而必欲獻媚敵酋以謀自身之利祿，明明有靑天白日之國旗而必欲改用五色旗幟以禾對立，明明有慷慨激昻之民氣而必欲納之敵僞使作順民</p>
<p>而其僞組織旣以政府命名，又復分曹設事，儼同中央之政權，謂係擴大之維持會顯屬擬於不倫。至其設置綏靖軍也，雖曰維持治安實則供敵人之驅策。其籌立禁烟局也，雖曰制止日方經營鴉片，實則假公賣以牟利。其發行華興銀行鈔票也，雖曰不影響於人民實則有意擾亂金融，縱使發行數額不及僞中儲劵之多，亦僅五十步與百步之分。其於橫征暴歛也，雖曰僅足維持僞組織之開支，要亦爲敵僞充裕財力。而其　奪海關，旣不否認亦不能謂無實據。且其</p>
<p>歷次宣言中有「焦土政策等於自戕，容納共產儼同召寇，是有史以來未有之惡政府」及「專積誤國之黨政府已失却人民之信仰，陷於崩潰之時」。有僞維新政府宣言及南京淪陷周年發表談話等證件可證。則其詆毁中央，破壞國體，無所不用其極，安得諉爲　　性質。此等策動謀叛，賣國求榮，仇視黨國，認賊作父之行爲，而猶曰絕無通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之意思，則古時之石　　，張邦昌輩遭受千古之　駡者不亦大爲　　乎。質諸被告恐亦難自解。</p>
<h3>維持原判理由</h3>
<p>至所以不予减刑，仍維持原判死刑之理由則稱：査處理漢奸案件條例第三條規定前條漢奸曾爲協助抗戰工作或有利於人民之行爲證據確實者，得减輕其刑云云，法文旣明定爲得减，則應否减輕，法官自有酌斟之權，如審量案情縱有協助抗戰工作或有利於人民之行爲，而就其他逆跡比較其功罪，不足以相抵者，則不予减輕亦非違法。故本案被吿非處以極刑，實不足以昭烱戒，而彰國法云。</p>
<h3>張素民昨日續審　陳金生十六宣判</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於跑馬總會公司債券執有者，狄勃斯，所羅門等四人，要求跑馬總會法定代理人，依二千倍還本一案，地院定於明日上午宣判。記者昨日往訪原吿律師桂中樞，據吿稱：渠所持之法律根據爲「復員後補充民事訴訟條例」第十二條：「法律行爲成立後，因不可歸責於當事人之事由，致情勢變更　非當時所能預料，而依其原有效果，顯失公平者，法院應公平裁量，爲增减給付，或變更其他原有效果之判決」。</p>
<p>跑馬總會公司債券係民國二十三年所發行者，因該時跑馬總會欠匯豐銀行款項二百餘萬元到期，該總會無力償付，乃發公司債券三百萬元，以地產爲抵押，利率六厘。</p>
<p>桂律師所建議之增價償還標準，共有三種辦法：一，以銀價爲標準；二，以地產產價爲標準；三，以生活指數爲標準。</p>
<p>桂中樞氏吿記者稱：公司債與政府公債不同。因國家主權不受法律拘束。且公債係政府負擔，亦即全國人民負擔，八年抗戰，國家損失浩大，公債一對一還本，即係减輕全體人民負擔。公司債與銀行存款亦不同，因公司債係債務人負擔，銀行存款，則係私人財產。委託銀行保管者。</p>

<h3>第三期後半月聯合配紗　明日起賡續開配　第一次總額爲六千零二件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第三期棉紗聯配總額二四〇〇九件，首半月配額一二〇〇四件半，自上月廿六日開始配售以來，至今日即告辦理完竣。明日（十一日），第三期後半月一二〇〇四件半，即將起配。手續方面，視前無多大變更。各紗配價，仍與首半月次期之議價相同。惟一說後半月之兩次配紗時期，每次將延長至十日。較首半月兩次之配紗期，每次增加三日。</p>
<p>聞各複製品公會，以所屬會員眾多，首半月配紗前，未及填送申請單者，均請求於次半月中加入申請。紡管會方面，以次半月之首次配紗，明日即待施行，故此次已不及考慮。又據複製品公會報告，略以各廠過去配紗支數及種類，不盡適用，請求設法改進。紡管會方面據此着各複製品公會準備統計資料兩種：（一）各公會所屬各會員實際詳情，及其實際需紗量。（二）各公會需要棉紗之支數及種類。以上統限於十五日彙送紡管會，俾便在次半月第二次配紗時，予以可能之調整。</p>
<p>紡建開紗種類</p>
<p>又後半月首次配紗總額爲二四〇〇九件又四分之一，即六〇〇二件又四分之一。依紡建三分之一，民營各廠三分之二之比例攤派，紡建應攤二〇〇一件，民營各廠應攤六〇〇一件又四分之一。茲紡建爲應各複製品公會需求，本期增加一百伴，共爲二一〇一件，且增加細紗各類。茲將紡建本期開紗支數，牌名，各類，件數，及單價，列表如後：</p>
<p>支數　牌名各類　件數　單價</p>
<p>二〇支　彩球筒紗　二〇〇　一七五萬</p>
<p>二〇支　立馬筒紗　二〇〇　一七五萬</p>

<p>以上各紗，共計一四六五件，折合廿支紗爲二一〇一件。共計價銀三十六億三千二百三十萬元。</p>
<p>棉紗用量增加</p>
<p>複配會負責人潘士浩氏，於下午在複配會邀葉染織，針織，內衣，毛巾被毯，手帕，手工棉織等業代表，報告一切，對於已申報而已受配各廠之考核，及補申報各工廠之調查，決議加緊辦理，務期請求申配之數，能不致溢報，已受配各廠，能免除流弊，據潘氏表示，各業原申報之用紗量，爲每月四萬零零十三件，經紡管會指定，照六折分四次撥配，補行申報者，共需一萬四千件，而已申補各廠之調整用紗量者，統扯亦有增加，當須加算，則此後增配之額，當在原配量加三分之一以上，各業正在嚴定標準，重行審核，預料將有一部份廠家减少配額，但絕大部份之廠家，照六折核配，委實不足，手帕，及毛巾被毯業，原申報冊，係照六折開陳，而未經聲叙明白，紡管會又重打六折，至大部份廠家，缺紗尤甚，潘氏曾將此中原委，明告當局，終以辦事程序上，須經過相當之手續，一時未及修正，上次配紗，各業共退單三百數十件，此次退單尤多，其原因除支種不合外，複製工業生意呆滯，拆息髙昂，與此亦有關係，而規模較大之廠，因六折核配，則屬不足，真可謂苦樂不均，紡管會當局，對於支數問題，認爲有解決辦法，李副主任將約紗廠業王啓宇，及複製業潘士浩二氏商談。</p>
<p>紗市仍少成交</p>
<p>昨日紗業市塲仍格於限價，鮮有成交，形成啞市，客幫搜購無着，頗有限價外暗加手續費者，彼此心照不宣，聞暗中做價頗爲堅俏，如廿支特雙馬二百廿五萬，特金城二百二十萬，紅魁星二百萬，十支金實星一百六十五萬，俱爲超　過公定之價，四十二支藍鳳做二百卅五萬，卅二支藍鳳二百七十八萬，廿支藍鳳二百萬，卅二支銀月二百四十三萬，則較之昨日，普遍小回。</p>
<h3>金價穩健</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以和平空氣轉濃，買戶意興較淡，但以週末及封關關係，低徒尙易回升，晟開二三九萬光景，開後自二三九萬五起逐漸遭央行壓低，證券幫中人脫金換股，賣氣更甚，而步降至二三六萬二，十時後央行配給一〇〇條，價爲二三六萬五，低後轉盤，近午漸露穩態，午刻升至二三七萬五光景掙扎，午刻過後買戶復在種種臆測下見股，喊價躍髙至二四〇萬以外，結果較前收升一萬餘，銀樓飾金及紋銀均平，銀元微昂，暗拆銀根平平，息價仍在一角半左右。</p>
<h3>美鈔暗漲</h3>
<p>外幣情况稍穩，美鈔暗市中約四一三〇元至四一八〇元，較前日略好，午後續抬至四二〇〇元以上，四時以後，突傳有四五〇〇元之價，惟星六收市較早，故此價尙不普遍，港票初平後疲，純因電匯不漲之故，結果反較前收跌落十元，港電匯退至八六二元及八六五元，都由廣幫供售，印匯一〇四五元，英匯一四〇〇〇元，均少買戶，美匯牌價未更。</p>
<h3>時局漸次明朗　股市人心振奮　華股昨一致回升</h3>
<p>華股昨變幻較多，晟開時因停戰消息人心見俏，各股均昂，開後塲外買戶陸續補進，塲內買氣奇盛，繼續盤漲，髙價時漸呈盤旋，一七六號一九八號等有售，漸漸回落，中途大事掙扎，乍起乍落，極盡變幻，然以空方補額已滿，賣方既源源而來，此後漸成有售少買之象，中途起形勢轉疲，引起多方惴惴不安，十一時半後忽有斬多，一度破入六〇〇元關內，但此後　空衹補，一五一號買意再盛，時間迫切，加之某莊出後急進，一五四號一五一號互相急補，各股逐在臨收數分簽內漲到髙價結束，結果較前收熱股永紗新光升半成，信和景福勤興各升百分之七，美亞獨漲一成，冷股景綸新亞麗安平平，餘者都告微升至半成光景，總成交額共九五二萬股，塲外各股稍形微升。</p>
<p>外股昨稍平穩，各股逢低維持有人，稍稍回升，結果較前收計怡紗會德　業處航業鋼業微升，餘者各漲半成光景。</p>
<h3>人造絲黑市又漲　一二〇號半光最鋒俏</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市又呈蓬勃，尤以一二〇號半光最鋒俏，因市上貨稀，昨日做價抬髙十萬元，一二〇號有光亦漲三萬至五萬元不等，天橋新裝貨三十五萬元有人要，一五〇號有光及半光均大五萬元，獨七五號半光去路呆滯，維持上日原盤。廠經交易甚鮮，七十一二分普通次貨同行做三百卅五萬元，實銷廠商均不採辦，以致欲漲無力，綢貨被面昨略見榮，盛貨獨見疲跌一二千元，因市上現貨充塞，不乏求現廉脫。</p>
<h3>廣州紗價飛漲　陳克成來滬呼籲</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕自棉紗限制南運後，穗紗價突漲，二十支棉紗每包需三百萬元，因出口成本過髙，無法銷售，致九百餘家織造廠，被迫停業者達百分之八十以上，工人失業達十數萬人，形成工業上及社會上之一大危機，織染工業生產合作社主席陳克成，八日特爲此飛滬，向主管及有關機構呼籲，請運粵濟銷。</p>
<h3>紗廠收購棉花　四聯可供給資金</h3>
<p>新棉業已登塲，各紗廠紗商，正分頭收購中。四聯總處爲供給各廠商之購棉資金，特訂定棉花押滙辦法，國家行局已遵令辦理。據悉各紗廠向產區購棉，不但可做押滙到達用棉地區時，且可轉做押款，但各廠原已購存之棉花，一律不得申做押款。至花商所購之棉，衹限做押滙，不能轉做押款。</p>
<h3>聯合商場　須向社局具結　不賣漏稅私貨</h3>
<p>最近本市商塲風起雲湧，且規模甚大，大部份係經營外貨，包括日用品，消耗品，奢侈品及醫藥品，其來源是否完全係繳付捐稅之海關所准許進口之貨物，殊屬疑問，茲悉市政當局特規定管理辦法，任何聯合商塲，均須依法辦理登記，照章繳納捐稅，其商塲主持人一律必須向社會局具結，保證商塲以內所售貨物絕無走私或漏稅之物品，且負責保證繳納各項捐稅，如有陽奉陰違情事，將從嚴處罰，或勒令其停止營業。</p>
<h3>日本白報紙　美國經手轉售</h3>
<p>據悉：最近白報紙至貨頗湧，故市價又告低落，日昨美商海寗洋行曾由美運到大批白報紙，照該批白報紙，係美國先向日本採辦後，再轉停我國，其紙張實地，均不運美國，日本最近對紙業正發動大量生產，過去日本出品之透明紙，曾著名於世界各國，即童國亦所不及云。</p>
<h3>米價堅油價跌　洋粉在傳說中</h3>
<p>米情到源湧旺，南北市共一萬四千餘石，南市早堅午懈，北市旱疲午緊，結果粳秈米均無軒輊，白元陰元亦無升沉，麵粉消路見懈，回小一二百元，加拿大洋粉又有成交之說，尙待國外復電證實，麩皮去路甚細，價無出入，小麥到消兩稀，僅小型粉廠略進，市勢平正，黃豆運日猛跌之後，售價轉堅，回漲千元，紅糧雖隨至隨消，亦無上落，芝蔴來貨寥寥，消化尙活，續加千元，生仁步跌之後，店方乘巧納取，止跌轉漲，價升二三千元，花生亦加一二千元，豆餅外埠不動，消化呆滯，市形疲而少神，油市回小，各油均續跌一二千元。</p>
<h3>平粉供多求少　商號墊款困難</h3>
<p>麵粉平價配售處，自上月間受粉價波動及粉廠停工影響後，配售機構已於本月一日起改組，配售工作，由粉麩商業同業公會接辦，開售數量亦已增加至一萬二千袋，每袋價格提髙至二萬〇五百元，官價與黑市價相差無幾，開售以來，供多求少，每天結存數達三分之一，致一般麵粉商號無力墊款，頗感困難，據記者獲悉：該處配售麵粉手續，係每天由五廠撥付麵粉一萬二千袋，經公會轉撥各麵粉商號分售，至價款由商號先行墊繳，近以官價提髙，實用戶多存觀望，致麵粉商週轉不靈，同時經售配粉商號之利潤，每袋抵一百元，公會手續費一百元，稅率三百元，駁運軍費三百元，廠盤一萬九千七百元，合如上數，聞各商號近已向有關各方請求改善配售辦法云。</p>
<h3>烟白煤背馳　烟煤貨主扳俏　白煤鴻基有到</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤配售數量雖已由公會核定，現公會共有同業一〇二八單位，計每同業實配十一噸，餘數四千餘噸，配售與聯營處股東，同業凡持有聯營處股份一股，再配一噸半，若辦理迅速，約於下週中即可開始分派，然其申購手續極爲麻煩，並不得在黑市轉售，故現同業持有貨者，均扳價關住，行市步向髙峯，白煤鴻基塊煤近自香港運來頗多，品質亦較上次爲佳，是以陽泉白煤市價亦已自一百十萬元回進百萬元關，惟鴻基煤屑，則因到貨較少，價格又報漲。</p>
<h3>尙在籌備中之　安樂人造絲廠　技師雖已聘定　開工尙無確期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日外傳安樂人造絲將於本年內復工，記者特走訪安樂紡織公司負責人，詢問詳情。承答稱：復工當在今後一年之內。因向美國配購機器零件，訂貨交貨需八個月，運輸需四個月；如向英國訂貨時，則需十八個月；因此復工所需之期間，不能少於一年，外傳本年內能復工之說不確。至於聘請外籍技師來華，亦爲困難之工作。該廠之機器原購自法國，但法籍工程師不肯受聘，美國亦然，蓋在本國均切需此項人才。最後作憑感情關係，自英國規模最大之柯塔特人造絲工廠請來英籍技師三位，現已抵滬開始服務。該廠開工以後，每日可出人造絲十七箱。按安樂人造絲廠之創辦，爲時在民國廿六年抗戰前夕，資本爲國幣六百萬元，規模宏大。當時財政界巨子某氏亦籌備一人造絲廠，資本五百萬元。抗戰發生後，安樂廠繼續建造廠址，後者則宣告停頓，並退回股本。故在抗戰全勝後之今日，安樂爲我國唯一之人造絲廠。且因建立該項工廠，所需資本太大，技術亦需求助外人，故截至今日爲止，絲業界人士尙無投資之企圖。</p>
<h3>葛敬中建議　挽救絲業危機　第一改良品質　第二减輕成本</h3>
<p>我國蠶絲業，年來雖經政府設法扶持，中蠶公司極力輔導，仍未打開僵局，且危機益加嚴重，中蠶公司爲挽救是項危機，特邀農林部，江浙兩省府，繅絲公會，及蠶種業等各方代表集滬商討對策，會議已於八日開始，因問題過多且甚複雜，會議仍在繼續進行，日內尙難結束，據悉：此次會議，在決定原則，至於如何挽救危機之具體辦法，須由興會各方代表分頭負責再行研究，據中蠶公司葛總經理敬中談，目前中國蠶絲業，已而臨嚴重之危機，在現階段之情况下，唯有自謀挽救，望政府幫助，並非正當辦法，自救之道有二，第一改良品質，第二减輕成本，以上兩項，即爲此次會議之最髙原則，亦即挽救今日蠶絲業危機之要道云。</p>

<p>本市各榨油廠，以最近豆餅銷路呆滯，僅恃豆油實銷，不能維持成本，故豆油產量稀少，吳市長認爲欲使豆油價格穩定，應先加增生產，欲使油廠加緊生產，則又非推動豆餅銷路莫屬，吳市長爲此項問題，謀取澈底解決辦法，特於昨午二時半在市府召集有關方面會議，出席者有市銀行總經理道仲陶，中信局推銷處經理何墨林，台灣貿易局上海辦事處主任徐恒壽，台糖公司協理宋以信，及榨油業公會代表李祖葉等，首由吳市長發表意見，擬將豆餅向台灣方面或由中信局向各地農村推銷，以增加農作物肥料，或作飼養牲畜原料，其原則當經同意，惟台糖公司宋以信氏稱：豆餅每噸市價約五十萬元，該公司設法由行總取得化學肥料國，雖價格每噸達六十萬元，其施肥效力，則超過豆餅兩億以上，認爲太不合算，至台灣貿易局及中信局如何購買豆餅一節，辦法另訂，關於油廠代表擬申請五億元貸款問題，當時亦曾議及。</p>
<h3>中央銀行舉辦　出口物資貸款</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲救濟出口業，特舉辦出口物資貸款，凡出口商擬購製運鎖國外者，該行即貸與款項，購妥後，由產地運至港口時，可再貸款，辦理押匯連成一氣，即將出口業之貸款分爲兩個階段辦理，第一階段爲國內貸款，係由產地運至上海爲止，第二階段爲國外貸款，係由上海運至國外市塲爲止，其貸款數字，將視出口商之需要而定，詳細辦法已擬定呈核云。</p>
<h3>食米限制轉口　奉令延長一月</h3>
<p>前因本市食米缺乏，當局特訂定限制食米轉口辦法，內載食米報運轉口須繳呈產米區米商發票，同業公會證明書及關單運單證件兩種以上，並須由糧食部出具證明書，經海關查明後，始能放行，是項限制轉口辦法，原定上月底廢止，頃據海關公佈，已奉行政院命令，將此辦法實施期限延長一個月云。</p>
<h3>公債逐步盤升</h3>
<p>公債市况續穩，統丙晨開一三五〇元光景，誠德以及散戶咸有買胃，自一三四〇元以下，逐步盤升至一五〇〇元弱，午刻在一四五〇元至一四八〇元之間徘徊，結果校前收漲一四〇元，甲乙丁各升二十元，統戊亦好六十元，成效約五百萬元。</p>
<h3>北帮大量搜購　棉布各檔均漲</h3>
<p>棉布因北帮大量搜購，低檔貨均向榮，紡建所開各髙檔貨亦提髙一千元，其他布疋髙升一二千元不等，市塲龍頭現貨做八萬三千元，紡建開到貨則爲八萬一千元，色布因燃料顏料運日上漲，亦多提升，大陸士林開十二萬五千元。</p>
<h3>海味實銷清淡</h3>
<p>海味來源不絕，市疲少神，蝦尾木耳海咸淡菜祈菜等頻跌不已，干貝魷魚急趨下游，三四日內慘跌三成，海參明穩暗鬆，洋菜紫菜落令貨，無人問津，新茹粉到湧銷稀，勢難立足，魚翅魚皮生粉穩中帶疲，惟魚肚貨缺，尙稱穩秀，其餘各貨，爲人心虛怯，一時難易好轉。</p>
<h3>非洲需要華茶</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，抽珍珍眉等花色，各出口行雖續擬動辦，無奈新貨嫌價髙昂，不敢問訊，陳茶品質欠佳，難合胃口，故市勢俱仍清寂，茲據業中人云，我國茶葉，目前海外均極需求，旦尤以非洲摩洛哥一帶爲最，聞本市某茶葉公司，日內將由彼地匯得鎮額法郎，囑樸價廉物美者，儘量裝運，惟膽望前途，在華茶生產成本趨漲下，外銷一時恐未許樂觀。</p>

<p>馬夫人　演說</p>
<p>略謂：余見許多青年在此求學，殊爲髙興，美國有許多青年愛護中國，蓋渠等父兄，或曾來中國，或仍在中國，目覩中國青年在八年中團結一致，英勇抗日，殊爲欽佩故也。今日美國青年，倘知余來此參觀，必將囑余帶一口信，表示對汝等之關懷與友誼。汝等在此頭腦中所學到之東西，無人可搶，實爲爾等自己所有。爾等應尊重老師，學習老師，然後爾等之生活，可更豐富，可更愉快。</p>
<p>張靄真　演說</p>
<p>略謂：俞校長，係余數十年老友。俞校長前出任社教處處長，非爲做官，而爲推動工作。爾等在此讀書，機會實不可多得。爾等應抓住此機會，好好讀書。最後由托兒所，婦女組，少年組學生表演遊藝節目，有小兎子，賣菜歌，小音樂隊等，至五時許，蔣夫人等始在學生歡呼聲中含笑頷首而別。</p>

<h3>新聞記者看聯合國大會</h3>
<p>— 本報十月廿四日航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>這次的聯合國大會，比今年一月間在倫敦召開的，塲面更爲偉大。倫敦開幕的那天，我記得正下着迷濛細雨，成千的英國老百姓，站在雨中爭看羅斯福夫人。這次在紐約開會，陽光和煦，正碰上『秋高氣爽』的『好目子』。地利環境也是這次好，倫敦在中央大厦舉行，正門在一條陋巷裏，代表們的汽車，一旦攢人陋巷，便轉不過頭來。這次却在紐約郊外的大會堂舉行。那是在一個地名呌做『福魯興』的鄉區，寬暢平坦的柏油馬路，整齊堂皇的建築，碧草如茵，飄舞着五十一國聯介國的國旗。在我個人的記憶之中，雖還遠不如瑞士日內瓦的舊國聯房屋堂皇、但如作爲一個「世界政府」的臨時首都，像福魯興那樣的塲面，也够稱得上壯觀了。</p>

<p>我無從考訂福魯興大會堂是那一年建的。我認爲這次房屋的按排和分配，非常有條有理，正中是大會塲，會塲的北面是主席台，主席台向例分爲兩級，上邊是大會主席斯派克及秘書長賴伊的坐位，下級是報吿人或演講人的講壇，五十一國代表席，分三縱行排列，中國代表團在中間一行第三排，幾乎是全部的代表席的正中。代表席的兩排及後排。是旁聽席，旁聽席每天招攬着成千成萬的美國老百姓。樓上正面『包廂』是記者席，兩邊包廂是『廣播記者』席，這是會議廳的一個輸廓。這次因爲儘量減少翻譯，翻譯和速記的席次，排在講壇的前面，沒有像安全理事會那樣：翻譯官雄踞「要津」。</p>
<p>會議廳的後邊，是代表團代表顧問們的坐憇室及酒吧間，會議廳前邊是自助餐廳。餐廳供新聞記者及旁聽者之用。記者有專用的記者酒吧間，那是在樓上包廂的壁角。這次登記的記者，一共有一千多人，（中國記者的十人），很多記者專爲看一個開幕式，以後便不再來了。</p>
<p>新聞部主任喬治　精強力壯又忍耐</p>
<p>大會的新聞部主任是柏恩司，喬治先生，他原來是聯合國秘書處的新聞主任，一個精强力壯，頭髮半秃的華盛頓人。這是一個最不容易做的新聞官，非得精强力壯，而且有極大的忍耐力不可。每天要對付這麼多世界上最難對付的人，確是不容易的。開會前幾天，許多記者們兜攬着他問長問短，東邊一個呌：『哈囉，喬治』，西邊一個又喊：『喬治，房子弄好了沒有』？中間一個又問：『喬治，汽車停什麼地方』？他是那樣耐心的回答，而且不厭求詳的解答每一個記者的疑問。開會前一天喬治召集了一次記者準備會議，報吿許多記者『應行注意事項』，這次『準備會議』，是在聯合國秘書處召集的，距離福魯興會塲，尙有十餘英里，喬治說：新聞記者一律由第八號門人塲。下面一位美國老記者問：『第人號在什麼地方？』喩治說：『我沒央會塲看過，據說在會塲的西北角。』老記者又問：『西北角在什麼地方？』例如這樣的難題目很冬很多，然而大會新聞部，做得確比倫敦時更好。</p>
<p>五強各有特別室　中國報館佔一間</p>
<p>新聞記者的等級是不容易分的，誰都不肯承認自己的通訊社或報社渺小。樓上有六間特別室，喬治把它分配給路透，合衆，塔斯，美聯，中央，和法國通訊社，五强各有其一。此外，尙有十多間較小的特別室，分配給各國的大報館，這裏面便難免有許多爭執。上海申報，南京和平日報及紐約『時代雜誌』合用一間，這是中國報紙唯一的一間特別室。此外，紐約時報獨佔一室，芝加哥講壞報和紐約每日新聞，因爲老闆是親戚，所以也合用一間。特別室以外，便是『大寫字間』了。</p>
<p>東方式營業競爭　在這裏初次見到</p>
<p>電報公司兜生意，已是『洋洋大觀』，新聞無綫常公司，RCA公司，麥開電報公司，西聯公司，海底電報公司，各人都佔據樓上的一角，大量的分送打字紙，招攬生意，這般營業員，對記者老爺們的恭維容氣，那眞是無以復加。有一天，好幾名中國記者，在記者酒吧間小飲，到付賬時，堂倌說：麥開無綫電公司替你們付了。像這樣的帶有『東方式』的營業競爭，我到美國，還是第一次看到。</p>
<p>無冕王進休息室　嚇跑了有冕之王</p>
<p>有一點劃分，大凡大通訊社的記者，多半偏重於會塲會務的進行：演講的內容，辯論的要點，他們的電報快，本錢足。報館記者，多半偏重在『後台新聞』，前面說過，『後台』分兩部：一部是代表坐憇休息室，是准許記者自由入內與代表談話的；一部是代表酒吧間，記者不得任意入內，除非有一個例外，那便是經代表邀請以後，方准入內。當初喬治和秘書處商量決定這辦法時，用意本來很好，但是想不到：因爲這羣『無冕之王』打進了休息室，竟把那些『有冕之王』都嚇跑了。開會第一二三天，所有重要國家的代表，都躱在酒吧間裏，『深居簡出』，以避免記者的滋擾。中國首席代表顧維鈞博士，因爲進盥洗間，經過休息室，中途被攔住了照相，談話，弄得滔滔不休。</p>
<p>美蘇代表雄赳赳進會場　美國記者做了一個鬼臉</p>
<p>有些小國的代表，爲了想多露面，常常在外面休息室中的，烏克蘭代表曼努章斯基便是一個。他知道記者們的筆上可以『生花』，因此，便隨時在休息室『散步』，可惜的是：美國記者們，很少能認得他：那位多言善辯，白髮蕭蕭的列寗的革命老同志。</p>
<p>我跟曼努意斯基談過好幾次，我覺得他很和萬可親。並不像莫洛托夫那樣氣燄萬丈，使人有點不服氣之感。開幕式前幾分鐘，一大羣記者守在代表進入會塲的門口，莫洛托夫率領蘇俄代表團到達，他走在前而，左邊是維辛斯基，右邊是葛羅米珂，後邊是穿俄國軍裝的軍事參謀，一大羣人步伐整齊，氣燄非常雄壯，一時休息室中，爲之屏息肅靜。一位美國同業，向我對望一眼，他做了一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>顧維鈞博士穿一身非常緊窄的淺黑式西裝，他和大使館的劉秘書，顧秘書，是第二批進塲的代我。郭泰祺代表一個人進來，他非常瀟洒，臉上的血色很好。</p>
<p>杜魯門姍姍來遲　口齒清脆咬音準</p>
<p>杜魯門總統故意遲到幾分鐘，那是爲便於保護的緣故，秘密警察密佈於總統四週。因爲他是副總統繼任總統的緣故，爲了美國的憲法，美國人民對社魯門總統在一九四八年以前的生命安全，是費盡一切可能求其週密。杜魯門總統在大會開幕禮上，一貫的露着笑容，雖然他的訓詞內容非常銳厲，但是，他的書生一樣文弱的嗓子，使講詞內容無法爆發力量，他的口齒非常淸脆，每一個英文字的音節，咬得非常準確。他的演講，和貝爾納斯的完全相反，貝爾納斯的演講有力量，聲音顫抖發沙，但咬字不淸，音節非常含況。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統宣讀訓詞的時候，也偶而有一點『手勢』。例如：講到戰爭的恐懼仍然沒有解除一句時，他把兩手一伸。他的手勢，和他斯文的聲音，緩慢的言語配不起來。他常常喝白開水，每講二三小節，便要喝一口白開水。</p>
<p>大會主席斯巴克　比利時法文宏喨</p>
<p>大會主席斯巴克，是老成練達的外交家，他的法文，說得明朗宏亮，在倫敦今年一月間開會的時候，我對他的印象是活像邱吉爾，相隔九個月，我覺得斯巴克蒼老多了，而且也瘦多了。有一張紐約的報紙，描寫斯巴克的『比利時法文」和秘書長賴伊的『挪威英文』，淋漓盡致。</p>
<p>莫氏走錯一道門　各報作成大標題</p>
<p>然而，大部份記者集中的對象。仍然在於莫洛托夫。紐約有幾家報館，派有專隨莫洛托夫採訪的專責記者。開幕典禮完畢以後，莫洛托夫走錯了一道門，被紐的各報作大標題刋載着。</p>
<p>那天，記者們難得看到莫洛托夫好幾次『微笑』，那是在和杜魯門談話的時候，他用俄文講：『很高興恭聽總統的演說，眞是好極了。』莫洛托夫的隨從翻譯潘芙洛夫譯成英文，然後杜魯門總統說：『謝謝你』。莫洛托夫又說：『深深感謝你』。</p>
<p>翻來覆去講客套　全部不出六句話</p>
<p>莫洛托夫看見總統的新聞專員魯斯，也露著笑臉，他們親熟地拉手。莫洛托夫說：『從菠茨坦會議以來，我老記得你』！魯斯有點受寵若驚的樣子。</p>
<p>開幕典禮那天晚上，紐約阿斯托里飯店，各國代表初次晚會，杜魯門夫婦也參加。總統多半時間和莫洛托夫在一起，莫洛托夫還這那幾句：「感謝總統」，「很高興聽總統的演講』。他們談得「好像」很親密。但是：前鋒論壇報的記者描寫說：他們翻來覆去講些客套話，總數不出六句！　這就呌做外交，且看人類史上這稱最偉大的外交的塲面！（十月二十四日寄）</p>

<h3>致毛澤東先生　知無不言書（下）　「蘇皖邊區政府」「華中文化協會」</h3>
<p>— 顧問　朱堯天</p>
<p>關於「征收物我」與「沒收財產」，在你的經濟幹部跟中，有物征重我，有產全沒收，這是已經堅定過「信念」的共產黨員，應該做的份內事情，然而話得說回來，你的經濟幹部，這樣做就算是對的話，那末仍然還不是「一切都爲共產黨」與「共產黨員從來不丢一個錢的」二句話嗎？如果你們硬着心腸仍然「一切都爲老百姓」與「共產黨從來就不要一個錢的」的說下去，相信道種說法的，當然是仍有人在，（按：一年前我也是如此的）但光好聽而不好看，道到底是不大妥當的調調兒呢。</p>
<p>再談談「黨分之於商的經濟」吧，你的經濟幹部「分之於商」後所造成的現象，大致是這樣的：</p>
<p>沒足息靈交通便</p>
<p>買進賣出互連環</p>
<p>大魚吸盡淮流水</p>
<p>小魚只有面朝天</p>
<p>以上四句是拙著「見聞詩歌」中「經濟歌」的節錄，它說明了「解放區」一切商業，統統被你的幹部們給獨佔了去，爲了證明我的說法：</p>
<p>舉幾個典型例子</p>
<p>地塊物價牌子　兩種運用妙處</p>
<p>先從所謂「公營」商業說起吧，你的幹部經營的「公營」商業，計有信託公司，企業公司，貿易公司，各級合作社，煤店，鹽店，油坊，布店，雜貨店，紙烟店以及飯館澡堂子等等，總而言之，除了大餅油條店，還沒有發現吃公糧，穿公衣的同志們坐地經營外，其他百業，可以說「無處不有黨人踪」。</p>
<p>公營商業的後台，的有二類，第一種是黨政軍各單位的，也就是規模較大的，一種是「榮譽軍人」，（即一般人所說的殘廢傷兵）的，也就是規模較小的。</p>
<p>黨政軍的各單位，依單位人數的多少，定「生產基金」就是做生意的本錢）的多少，此種「生產基金」，名義上是各該上級發下來的，實際上都是從「華中銀行」取來的紙幣，這種紙幣的分發，在原定額數中，是沒有利息的，超出數額以外的紙幣，也就是收到一批較多的便宜貨所用的本錢，只出一些幾乎等於手續費的利息，這說明了爲黨而生產的公營商店，它的資金是無限的，是隨着需要而增加的，所以它同民營的商店，也就是計算資金利息的商店，是根本不同的。</p>
<p>公營商店的經營人，大都是你的由軍而政，由政而商的吃公糧穿公衣的各級幹部，這在商店的開支上，比較民營商店少到幾乎等於沒有開支。</p>
<p>在買進賣出上，你們有「貨管局」，（即俗云的稅捐局）做你們的商情傳聲筒，茲舉一例，以概其餘：</p>
<p>在淮陰你們有個規模較大的貿易公司，以經營紗布報紙等爲大宗的，每天在門口掛一塊收進賣出的物價牌子，也就是攏斷市面的公開標記，它的運用妙處有二：</p>
<p>（一）需要收進者價格壓小</p>
<p>（二）準備賣出者價格抬高</p>
<p>如果有人去買價格壓小的貨物，他會回答說已經賣完，我有個　　的商人，他就是在這種巧妙　　法下，而呌苦連天的，事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>他看見這塊引人上當的牌子上，標着狼高的紗價，如是他便星夜到揚州買進一批相當數目的紗來，經過報稅的頭關，便狠明白的說出來，這批紗是運往淮陰的，在這批紗還沒有到達淮陰前，傳聲筒的「貨管局」早已將這個消息傳到公司了，到了貨到淮陰之日，便是引人上當的牌子改價之時，如是道位商人朋友呌苦矣！不賣吧，轉到別處不但要另出轉口稅，費日需時的利息，也委實吃不消，最後他在臨了還不明白的說一句「唉！眞是貨到地土死啊！」至此這批高價販來的紗被你們的貿易公司低價收去矣！</p>
<p>此外，你的各級幹部，竟堂而皇之吃着公糧穿着公衣（即你們的軍服）掛着短槍成羣結隊的跑起單帮來，舉凡老百姓不許販的東西，如耕牛以及某項農產品等，這批武裝起來的大單帮客，都可以隨意的販去販來，你想一般自資的小本商人，在這樣情形下，他們除了「面朝天」而外，還有什麽生路呢？至於你的高級幹部口頭上所說的，與墻頭上所寫的，現在我再代你們宣傳一下吧：</p>
<p>保障民族資本</p>
<p>保障工商業自由</p>
<p>保障貿易自由</p>
<p>歡迎民族資本家到解放區來</p>
<p>你們經濟政策的證法是如上的，你們經濟政策的做法是反如上的，毛先生這到底是怎麼一回事呢？我實在有點弄不淸楚哩。</p>
<p>再從文化說起</p>
<p>如果思想打通　便到處喫得開</p>
<p>你們「解放區」的文化，也同「解放區」的經濟一樣，是「一切都爲共產黨」的，只要有意無意的學會「中國共產黨與世界共產黨都是頂好，中國共產黨與世界共產黨以外的人都是不行」的說法，這在思想已經打通的說法下，便可以到處吃得開，反之便在思想沒有打通的說法下，不但是吃不開，接着就會賞給一頂「特務，反動派，頑固份子」的帽子載在頭上，如是被監視者有之，被關起來者有之，被槍斃者也有之，爲了不尙空話：</p>
<p>學幾個典型例子</p>
<p>所謂「潑冷水」　終於不了了之</p>
<p>先從一般現象說起吧，你們建議要政府給予人民四大自由，你們的報紙雜誌，每天都在說政府如何如何不給人民四大自由，尤其是言論出版的自由，爲了不是放空砲，每次都舉出些統計數字來，如某次沒收刋物圖書幾百種，每决封閉刋物與圖書社幾十家等，你們這種大吹大擂的反面，當然是在說，惟有「解放區」不沒收刋物與圖書，惟有「解放區」不封閉列物與岡書社，可是百分之百，千分之千的鐵般事實，就從這個問題上出現了，原來你們的「解放區」，在事前根本就不許，也不可能出版一種反對「頂好」與「不行」的刋物與圖書，因此旣用不着沒收，也用不茄封閉，這是事實造成的事實，自然整個「解放區」便成爲淸一色「頂好」與「不行」的前進文化了！</p>
<p>話越說越遠了，還是說個典型例子吧，今年春天，戲劇家宋之的先生（現在已回上海）他同趙慧深（現仍在蘇北）到淮陰去觀光在我經營的國民大戲院門口遇到了，由於即將上演我當時不能離開的緣故，所以第二天早晨到他們住的地方（淸江招待所，後被火燒掉了）去看望他們，因爲時間尙早，趙小姐還沒有起來，宋先生才起來洗臉，寒暄後便坐下談起閒話來，最後我在無意中談起來許久成的被鬥罰款事，這時候房裏共有三個人，計宋先生與我，另外還有一個「華中文化協會」的同事，在我離開招待所的幾小時後，「華中文化協會」的責任者黃源先生，便送來一個紙條，找我馬上到會裏去談話，最初我以爲還不是「頂好」與「不行」的老玩藝嗎？等我進得門來，便覺得有些顏色不對了，黃先生愁着眉頭說「……你這樣說話，已經忘記立塲，這完全是反動派潑冷水的說法……」，「請問黃先生我應該是什麼立塲」，我說，黃先生沉思了一下，沒有回答出什麼，接着又這樣說下去「……資本主義國家的言論自由是假的，拿美國廣播電台來說吧，國營電合是不許老百姓進去說話的，大資本家經營的民營電台，也不許老百姓進去說話的，老百姓有話，只能站在馬路上哇啦哇啦的喊一陣，這是沒有人管的……」，我接着插嘴說，「黃先生，我今天的說話，是在淸江招待所房子裏，聽話的人只有宋之的先生一個人，我並沒有站在馬路上哇啦哇啦的喊呀……」，最後在不歡而散的情勢下，這件「潑冷水」的言論自由案，終於算是不了了之了，這是第一個典型例子。</p>
<p>「解放區」劇人向九機關登記</p>
<p>第二個典型例子是這樣的：有一個時期，你們的報紙與刋物，每天與每期都巨題登載，政府壓迫上海新舊劇人登記啦，新舊劇人反對向政府登記啦的專論，消息與轉載，你們大吹大擂的反面，好像又在說，惟有「解放區」的劇人，用不着登記似的，然而事實是完全相反的，你的幹部反對上海劇人向上海社會局一個機關登記，而你們的「解放區」却命令劇人，在只有四萬餘人口的淮陰，同時要向九個機關去登記，而且每個劇人的登記履歷，必須從離開娘胎起，怎樣生活，怎樣學戲，都跟誰學過戲，學了多少年，演了多少年，都到過什麼地方等等，我　國民大戲院的負責人，我是國民大戲院百餘名男女職演員的總經理，我曾專用一個書記，每天專門寫這個玩藝，爲了登記履歷的不詳細，曾遭到二次打回票重寫，謹將九個機關的名稱，分列於下：</p>
<p>（一）鎭政府</p>
<p>（二）區政府</p>
<p>（三）區政府公安分局</p>
<p>（四）市政府</p>
<p>（五）市政府公安局</p>
<p>（六）蘇皖邊區公安總局</p>
<p>（七）淮陰衛戍司令部</p>
<p>（八）蘇皖邊區敎育廳</p>
<p>（九）華中文化協會</p>
<p>爲了九處登記的不合理，我曾以國民大戲院總輕理資格，向各方抗議過，爲了不能負責「……淮陰特務狠多，大家應該多方面警惕，否則出了毛病，誰來負祖這個責任呢……」的說法，所以只好一二三四五六七八九的分別照登了！但但是在這個時候，你們的基本羣衆，都在駡你的八輩祖宗了！這是我親耳聽見的。</p>
<p>文化·軍事·其他</p>
<p>娃娃劇團演戲　借場子不給錢</p>
<p>再說一件比流氓還流氓的事情吧，在二個多月前，你們華中軍部的娃娃劇團，後改名爲實騐第三劇團，那時候的團長是你的中級幹部吳同志，現調華中軍區連絡部，爲了想借國民大戲院演三天戲，外快的賣界戲，便託了一個姓丁的我我來談條件，由於大家都是幹戲的關係，結果是國民大戲院每天祗收娃娃劇團損失費三千元，所有前後台職演員都照平常一樣的帮忙，你的吳團長當時爲表示感謝起見，當天晚上，帮國民大戲院演出二個短劇，以表相互帮忙之意，三天過去了，娃娃劇團三天收到演出的票價，共的五萬餘元，道大概又是「共產黨員從來不丢一個錢的」的作風吧，你的吳團長紅着面皮對我說，「對不起，政府的劇團在政府的房子裏演戲，是不應該出錢的……」，如是三天的九千元損失被騙掉了，後來雖經我嚴重抗議從「華巾文化協會」又討到了一部份，但國民大戲院百餘名職演員，對你的幹部都更深一層的認識了！</p>
<p>最後再說一件你的高級幹部的文化表現吧，王若飛，秦邦憲，葉挺等機毁人亡了以後，淮陰舉行了一個大規模的追悼會，地址是國民大戲院的舞臺上，參加追悼大會的人，除了包括整個華中區各高級幹事外，還包括了各個單位的代表，首先范長江先生發出鷄啼的聲音邊哭邊唸的誦祭文，接着有聲有色的演講開始了，一共多少個高級幹部在演講，我已經記不淸了，但是各個人演講的內容，可以說是完全相同的，這在偉大的一致性上說，的確是够瞧的了，不過我總覺得那天你們不是在開追悼會，這從你各高級幹部的口頭與高達數丈字過斗方輓聯的一致上，便可以得到事實上的證明，下面是口頭與文字一致的原文：</p>
<p>老賊不要臉破壞政協會</p>
<p>羣英遭大難誓拔黑茶山</p>
<p>共產黨軍隊中三部曲的程序</p>
<p>我認爲軍事是你們各項措施中比較最好的一項，在事實上雖然也同政治經濟文化一樣，也是「一切都爲共產黨」，但在明爭巧取上，的確還說得過去，不過這得指沒有分開的軍事集體而言，至於跑出來攪生產者，也就是跑出來代軍隊做生意者，以及復員下來的殘兵與病兵等，這些人們則又常別論了。</p>
<p>你們的「頂好」與「不行」的說法，在你們軍隊中，的確收到狠大效果，這個效果的獲得，也是通過三部曲的，三部曲的順序大致是這樣的：</p>
<p>（一）先給以一切隨便</p>
<p>（二）再給以吃飽穿暖</p>
<p>（三）後灌輸頂好與不行</p>
<p>由於這般人們，大都是現社會中生活不下去者的緣故，一經吃飽穿暖，一切又感到隨便，他們爲了現實生活，便非眞非假的「頂好」與「不行」起來，我親眼看到，你的十年沒有離開軍隊的幹部，對我談起前途，他會不自覺的熟淚長流，我想他在初嚐三部曲的時候，決不會有這種心情吧？</p>
<p>舉幾個典型例子</p>
<p>走進行家觀光　竟發現活招牌</p>
<p>沿着「解放區」運河的兩岸上，有好多具有歷史性的代客買賣的行，經營貨色大都是煤·鹽·油·以及其他各種農產品，由於你們的說法「代客買賣的行，是剝削的」緣故，因此整個「解放區」老百姓經營具有歷史性的行，便完全關門大吉了！但不久以後，又都粉飾一新的擇吉開張了，當我又走進每個行家觀光時，便發現每家都多了一塊穿公衣佩短槍的活招牌，原來你的幹部不許老百姓開行，但允許「榮譽軍人」開行，（按榮譽軍人者即業已復員之殘兵病兵也）商人爲了生活，只好花重價，出乾股，（即只分利，不出本的股子）託親拜友請這麽一個位活招牌來，以爲全家混口飯吃的工眞，毛先生！我想這種不大不小的傑作，你也許不會知道吧？</p>
<p>再說一件好像開玩笑的軍人故事吧，我經營的戲院是職業性質的，百餘名職演員的生活費與薪金，完全由我負責的，你們禮堂的租金與救災費，是一分不能少的，爲了優待軍人，從來是祇收半價，每天三三五五的軍人揩油，　已成經常的現象，我要說的這段軍人故事，只是規模比較大而辦法比較奇而已，事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>有一天夜裏，戲正在上演的時候，先來了幾個吹號的兵士，每人手拿喇叭站在入口處的兩邊，接着就一批一批的來了數十名徒手士兵，在一聲準備口令下，衝鋒號「的的打打」的在響了，如是乎數十名勇士好像怒潮般的冲進門來，這時候門被衝碎了，看門人被衝得五體投地了，演戲的人嚇呆了，看戲的人驚跑了，大家在不演不看的形勢下，你的基本羣衆數你上代的老戲，却又從新的開了塲了，毛先生你知道這些傑作嗎？</p>
<p>再從人民說起</p>
<p>領袖壓在我頭上　委實不大舒服</p>
<p>「爲人民服務」的說法，是你的幹部大講「新民主主義」時，從「一切都爲老百姓」的舊口頭語改換的新口頭語，爲了先說明「共產黨不是爲人民服務，」而是「人民爲共產黨服務」的眞實性，先說一段上面我已經提過的事實。</p>
<p>在整個「解放區」裘。尤其是各城門口的城牆上，以及所有的大建築物上，全都滿繪着你的數丈巨像，在每個巨像的上左方，全寫着紅光刺眼的巨字，原文是「中國人民領袖毛澤東」，我在第一次看到這個字樣的心情是这樣的，我是山國人民之一，我也是同情革命者之一，但從半空中突然發現一個硬壓在我頭上的領袖，委實感到不大舒適，後來我曾這樣想，如果把人民二字改爲共產黨三字，似乎還名實相符些，最後我想到這樣改也不妥當，中國現在是多黨國家，如果每個黨都爭着在城牆上畫領袖，就算不爲爭地位而打破腦袋的話，但在物力維艱的中國裏，我認爲這是浪費的，不知毛先生以爲何如？</p>
<p>寫寫民間小調　便成人民作家</p>
<p>你的高級文化幹部對我說，你們對「爲人民服務」的文化部門，也得到空前未有的成績，爲了證明事實，特將你們人民作家繆先生向我介紹，據繆先生說，他是出自田間，只讀了幾年私墊，現在能寫些東西，完全是黨的號召所致，他的作品，大都是民間小調，句子同數來寳的「緊打扳，慢邁步，眼前來到燒餅舖」差不多，茲節錄繆先生大作於下：</p>
<p>八路從來打勝仗</p>
<p>新四原木武藝强</p>
<p>大家感謝共產黨</p>
<p>他勝似咱的親爹與親娘</p>
<p>從這段大文的語氣上便可以得到「共產黨爲人民服務呢」？還是「人民爲共產黨服務呢」？的答案。</p>
<p>再說一件「爲人民服務」的公審故事吧，在召開公審大會的頭一天，你的幹部命令保長，保長再命令人民，命令原詞是這樣的：「明天上午八點鐘，你家派出一個人，手裏拿着武器，到我那裘集合，不管在街上，在會塲上，我喊什麼口號，你們就隨着我喊什麼口號，誰不喊，回來我就跟誰算賬，記住了沒有…」。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，一個參加公審大會的人民含着眼淚的對我說，「…眞是罪過罪過，這個被公審的人，我從來就沒聽說過，他做些什麼錯事，我連影子都模不着，可是保長領頭喊，要求政府槍斃這個壞十蛋，我也被逼着喊了，你說這個死鬼要是有靈找我來算賬，那我該拿什麼話回答他呀。從這段公審故事上也可以得到「共產黨爲人民服務呢」還是「人民爲共產黨服務呢」？的答案。</p>
<p>再說一件「爲人民服務」的逃亡故事吧，你們華中「解放區」逃亡在外的人民有數百萬之多，有一天我與你負祖鬥爭責任的幹部，談起人民逃亡的問題，你這位鬥爭幹部的偉論是這樣的，「……解放這逃亡在外的有四稱人，第一種是漢奸，第二種是地主，第三種是惡霸，第四種是壞蛋……」我問他說，「那末這好幾百萬人中，連一個好人也沒有嗎？」你的鬥爭幹部對我翻一翻白眼，好像他心裏頭又在說，「這個像伙思想還是沒有打通」似的，當時我眞有些忍不住了，我便正色肯定的說，「如果逃亡在外的數百萬人中，內裏有一個好人，你這位負責鬥爭者，也應該負完全責任」。在兩不開心的「再會」聲裏，終止了逃亡問題的對話。</p>
<p>理論，黨務，政治，經濟，文化，軍事，人民，已經大致的「知無不言」過了，至於是善意的，是惡意的，還是非善意非惡意的個人觀感，這些我都不便說它，毛先生看過會明白，其他看過的人自然也會明自。（三十五年九月二十日。）</p>

<h3>青年或兒童的演劇習作</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>要使戲劇敎育和其他藝術敎育如美術音樂等同樣建立，其基礎在創作活動上，首先要解決的問題，就是靑年或兒童的演劇，就藝術的立塲看來，究竟有什麼地位，這一類的演劇，當然不會是什麽成熟的藝術傑作，這祇能稱之爲習作。就另一方面講，則戲劇敎育，又祇有在藝術上能够成功，纔有共存在的價値。</p>
<p>這一個問題，是習作與藝術成品相互間的間題。而戲劇因爲自有其特殊情形，問題更加複雜·戲劇的特殊情形是，（一）以人體爲創造藝術的工具；（二）創作者並非個人，而是互相依賴的一羣人——一次上演中的全體演員，而這一羣人還必須依賴另外一些不爲觀衆所見的人。（三）依賴很多的物質條件。（四）與鑒賞者（觀衆）直接接觸而即時受到其反應的影響。</p>
<p>習作，尤其是初期的作品，它不能稱爲藝術品，是很顯明的事。然而藝術品又祇能從長期習作中逐漸成長。這其間的過程旣長又絕無可見的段落。要把習作從藝術成品中斷然書分出來，也是不可能的事。習作旣非藝術，何以可收藝術的效果呢？</p>
<p>初看是矛盾的現象，其實可以從古今論藝術者的態度得到解決。詳細說來，自然要從創作鑒賞兩方面立論纔可以槪藝術之全，但古今論者却多偏於創作。就我國而言，則儒家一系的「詩者志之所之也，」鍾嶸的「幼居寡悶，貧賤易安；」蕭梁時的「綠情綺靡，流連哀思；」李贄的童心說，以及由此發展的三袁的性靈說：都是就創作立論的。就西洋來說，則亞里士多德的情緒宣洩說：康德的純粹的美；托爾斯泰的情緒傳達說，克洛契的直觀說；也都是就創作立論的。創作的活動直接而顯明；鑒賞，有時候似乎不存在。創作的過程，由最朦朧的影像逐漸發展，直到作品最後完成，經過緩而深。鑒賞則精神活動的量和所需的時間遠較少，而所得因人而有深淺，相差可以極遠。所以，就對人的影響而言，鑒賞範圍雖廣，創作却更爲深入。因此，就教育的立塲來講，則創作活動是較有力的，是主要的部份；鑒賞則爲輔佐的部份。</p>
<p>單就創作說，則習作與藝術成品並無分別，祗除掉純粹模倣。創作是一種活動過程，除文字藝術之外，身體的活動都佔重要部份。所以創作的核心在於此活動的本身。至於活動的結果，即所謂藝術品者，反而不佔重要。祇有就鑒賞的立塲來說，習作和藝術品之間，有顯明的分別。至於創作，則這分別是旣不分明也不重要的。就創作活動的本身來說，則一個四歲的兒童在地上畫着簡陋的岡形，其精神之深沉正無殊偉大的畫家在結構他的傑作。所以，讓靑年或兒童從事藝術創作，雖其成品都幼稚可笑，而敎育的效果却已經得到了。</p>
<p>上面所提到的戲劇之四稱特殊情形，一經研究，就可以知道使戲劇更適宜於作敎育機構。戲劇的特殊情形，說明戲劇是怎麼依賴人體而少用工具，多依賴外在的條件而永不能由一個人完全控制。所以，理論底地說來，戲劇是絕不能達到技術上的完全的。又因爲每一次上演等於一次沒有練習的新的活動，使技術上的完美更難達到。因此，演劇的習作與演劇的藝術傑作之間，更無顯明的界限。兒童最簡陋的扮演遊戲，其心情與最偉大的演員之表演更想近，其影響本人的心身也較之其他藝術習作來得深入。</p>
<p>所以，丟開鑒賞，而單就創作的立塲來說，則靑年或兒童的演劇習作的藝術地位是毫無疑問的。而學校裏的戲劇敎育，又以學童自己表演爲主；演劇給他們看，僅居輔佐地位。所以戲劇敎育的基礎是非常堅實的，祇是學校裏實施戲劇敎育，還有許多理論上和實際上的問題亟待解決，所以目前還不能說是已經正式開始。</p>
<h3>讚美「寶石花」</h3>
<p>— 朱雷</p>
<p>一部蘇聯的五彩片</p>
<p>「寳石花」，這次在法國舉行的世界影片競賽會中，竟打倒素以彩色著名的美國影片，而榮獲彩片首獎。</p>
<p>從八年前滬光上映的彩色片「夜鶯曲」，到今天的「寳石花」，我們可以看到蘇聯在彩色方面有了驚人的進步。和美片作比，美片以濃　細緻見長，蘇片以淸新而接近大自然風物擅勝。</p>
<p>故事的題材採自烏拉爾一個民間童話，叙述一個年輕的寳石匠人，用自己的天才和手藝想完成一個寳石花式樣的杯子，但是這顆神花在世間是不易獲得的，他只能憑自己的想像完成成牠，而無法求其逼眞。於是，在每個星光燦爛的夜晚他有了遐思，找什麽機會去觀看這朶民間傳說中一年一度纔開放的天上奇葩。森林中的魔女出現了答應給他領路，但必須用愛情作交換條件。他已經有了情愛彌篤的未婚妻子，爲尋求最高藝術，就毅然在自己新婚的夜晚跟魔女走了。他終究看到了寳石開花，而作成一件完美的藝術品，並屢經推折，拒絕魔女情慾的引誘，與愛入完成姻緣</p>
<p>這部電影的主題，照電影說明書上說是藝術的作品藏之名山深谷，不能算作藝術品，惟有到了人民手裏，才有它的藝術價値。但我的意思以爲要獲取眞正的藝術應該向大自然的美麗巾掘發，纔能得到最高成就，無論音樂·圖畫·雕刻·文學……都逃不開這個例子。</p>
<p>這張電影最大成功處，就是每幅畫面的構造，都經過電影藝術家們的細心擘劃。角度，置景，佈局，氣氛，色彩的調合組成了一頁頁璀璨絕倫的油畫。你可以隨便截下一個跳動的畫面，帶回家去裝在鏡框裏，而獲得人家的驚奇嘆美。像林中吹角塲面，深夜遐思塲面，聚聽故事塲面，寳石作塲中老翁獨坐的塲面，美麗和深沉處可使你瞠目無言。演員也優良，每個人達到了所演角色的個性和內涵的深度，演靑年雕匠的沉着穩當，演老年雕匠的衰弱可憐，演寳石廠主的暴戾兇惡，演侯爵的陰陽怪氣，都異常特出。可惜全劇的故事結尾稍弱，片末幾堂山石的佈景和五色斑爛的燈光也漸入俗套，和片首幾個新穎美麗充滿大自然氣息的鏡頭差遠了。</p>
<h3>趙丹和秦怡在「遙遠的愛」中接吻一景</h3>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>戰前映過，原譯「浮生若夢」好片子。每一個演員有精彩戲可看，尤其是最後結尾的口琴會停留在你的腦際中與心坎裏久久不散，並　還帶了人生的感慨與何謂「快樂家庭」。</p>
<p>重逢有日</p>
<p>編劇寫得很深刻，有的地方也很細膩。</p>
<p>出塲介紹男女主角的用意極好，一用說白，一用動作，表示了兩人的特性，但可惜在戲的過程上尙缺少了一口氣，不能把它的原意隨着戲馬上或接着爲觀衆所接受，待到後來明白了這出塲的用意時，已不是每一個觀衆所可能的了。</p>
<p>購衣裳一段戲最純熟，含意也良深。</p>
<p>琴逑羅吉絲演來最佳，秀蘭鄧波兒的戲嫌嫰。佐瑟夫考彭稱職以上。</p>
<p>情海如潮</p>
<p>也是希爾頓的名著，那比「鴛夢重溫」差遠了。</p>
<p>結束轉得太快，大有我國通俗演義巾「刀下留人」之作風。</p>
<p>演員男女主角都在水準以上，三牌配角喬治山德士戲很多也很好。</p>
<p>桃色煩惱</p>
<p>戲的起始是好的，套用哈代上集「鴛鴦戲水」的結尾，在火車中躭擱了偌長時間而不使觀衆覺得沉悶，但後來是鬆了；題材也是隨手抓來的了，究竟　台本戲排到第十四本了總不能本本精彩。</p>
<p>飾哈代的新女朋友龐妮泰荷蘭薇平平。一對孿生姊妹也就是藉了「孿生」而已，沒有什麽大希望。</p>
<p>荒漠迷宮</p>
<p>「到××之路」的一系片子中，這部在噱頭上是不及前兩部（此部原名「到摩洛哥之路」），常常有某一節開始很好，而好了不久便陷入沉態，像沙漠中的桃樂賽拉摩影子，平克勞斯貝宮殿中唱歌，及最後一段大戰與脫逃等等都是。</p>
<p>演員中還算是平，但也不能算好；鮑勃最少拿出勁兒，桃樂賽總是「溫呑水」。</p>
<p>在美女陣中可以看見葉鳳黛卡洛，那時候她還沒有紅。</p>
<h3>談「清宮外史」的編導及設計</h3>
<p>— 靜文</p>
<p>「淸宮外史」劇本，早已有了評價，不再贅談。這次演出導演即是劇作者，以劇作者來導演自己寫的戲、當然會感到親切，和更理解如何處理劇本的，有些在劇本中文字上無法表達的情感，他自己在導演中却能把它表達出來，但相反，由編劇至演出都出諸一人，則往往會有些地方顧不到，也許田旁人導演，採川另一種手法，那演出的效果也就可能不同了。在演出裏，我們看出了揚村彬在導演上的才華，仔細而不瑣碎，有條不亂，劇情的起伏層次把握得恰到好處，從開幕到閉幕，整個的劇就有如長江浩流，有時波濤洶湧，有時風平浪靜，暢流而下，明快，緊湊，而不顯得冗長，拖泥帶水，從第二幕的選妃，和第四幕的慶壽，我們知道導演是善於處理大塲面的，人多而不亂，且畫面擺得甚爲優美，更烘托出當時的氣氛來。略差一點的，則是第五幕了，這一幕內於劇本本身就有些零亂，從劇本上說：劇情中發生的一切事情都要在這一幕裏告個段落，得個結束、而同時作者在這一幕裏又要開始爲他的淸宮外史第二部——「光緒變政記」埋下主要的伏綫。再由於這幕劇情的影響，表現在導演上的，則是有時呆板，有時零碎，給予觀衆的情緒也是斷續不繼的，比起前四幕來，則稍有遜色了。</p>
<p>構成佈景的條件，無非乎是綫條，色彩，和構圖。這幾個條件不同的運用，可以在舞台上表現出窮鄕僻壤，草屋寒舍，或者是繁華城市，大厦高樓，以至於這次的大淸王朝，巍峨宮殿，幕一拉開，就讓我驚嘆裝置設計李恩杰運用得盡善盡美，畫閣彫樑，雄偉大柱，就足以表現宮庭的氣魄了，用得那麽鮮明，簡潔，絕不顯得繁瑣，尤其第四幕，在那樣小的舞臺上，却把頤和園的深遠，廣闊表現得歷歷在目，用得更巧妙的，莫過於臺上和臺後一直不移動的四根大柱和兩條橫閣，設計者靠這幾根柱子，把觀衆一直鎖在宮庭裏。但第二三幕皇上的書房，牆上的小玩意似嫌太多了些，反而顯得氣派不够大</p>
<h3>熱情的觀眾</h3>
<p>— 小民</p>
<p>「中製」新片「敢死警備隊」，原名「警魂歌」，日前在滬光戲院公映，擁擠盛屬空前。</p>
<p>這幾天滬光門口，常有些警察無票恃強人塲，收票員當然不十分願意，一位警士却惡狠狠地說：</p>
<p>「你常心點，你！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」收票員爲了職責所在，也不肯示弱，幾乎要動起武來，但因人多，被勸阻了。「當心點，這算什麽話呢？」旁邊有位穿美式軍服的觀衆似乎在代鳴不平，很以警士之態度爲不然，對他瞪了一瞥鄙夷的目光。</p>
<p>「周巡官」終究是一個理想人物吧！什麽時候我們才能够欣賞那些在智勇雙全一團和氣的周巡官之下所敎練出來的警士們的臉譜呢？</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>民族至上</p>
<p>昇平時代或是漫天烽烟的夜晚，我們想像到戰火中的一個淸麗的戀愛，一道牆，有一天世界文明整個的毀滅了，燒完炸完坍完了，也許還剩下這麼一道牆，在大荒地中一男一女在這牆跟下重逢了；或者是一條防空壕，山崩天裂聲巾，一男一女經過無限滄桑然後會面了，這時他們才有一點細微的眞實，千萬年中一點閃光的時間。Eric　Knight是一個像找們一樣的幻夢者，可是這一點閃光飛得太快了，他把握不了，光榮逃兵和貴族少女也保藏不住，李伐克的導演更無法追踪，過去了，沒有留一個蒼涼的手勢。「民族至上」中的戀愛富有纏綿的感覺，我們的確感受到愛情的光輝，可是它沒有悱惻的情緒，夜色迷濛中的低語，草堆巾匆介的初吻，湖光山色的窗前漫談，只是幾幅靜謐的圖畫。最後李伐克爲了適合美國人脾胃而沒有忠實原著：男主人公的死亡不竹帶給人兩滴冰冷的淚，連一個悽慘的呢喃也沒有，瓊芳登的愛情表現眞的具有少女的滿望，泰羅鮑華增加了向所沒有的沉毅，這使我們也僅僅記得，大雨滂沱中一對情侶奔跑顛簸的飄零的影子，他們都知道他們自己需要甚麽，那麽坦然，眞誠和輕盈，可是徧偏不能永遠。</p>
<p>情海妒潮</p>
<p>小說匠希爾頓的原著，矯作曲折離奇照例是他的本色。和「鴛夢重溫」一樣他又以精神病者爲題材，這一回的這個妬忌猜疑的丈夫刻劃頗能入微，殺貓是他的第一種徵象，其後逐步陰謀的發展略較「鴛夢重溫」來得合理。本片有很好發展的Plot，它雖然和「深閨疑雲」「蝴蝶夢」一樣描寫猜疑的人，但是它有非常濃厚的傳奇劇的味這，范達克若是希區考克，他的導演手法會使「情海妬潮」染上神秘，緊强，恐怖的刺激，如今他的平淡的手法，不過順利地介紹了情節，稱職而已。企圖加害妻子一段門隙的脚影，自殺的程序和搶信强打電話的笑料，處理最佳，其他供嫌缺少氛圍和色彩，配音效果無所建樹，結尾則太俗。羅勃蒙高茂萊和飾法國老醫生的，成績甚好。股格蘭褒曼當時尙未成名，技藝不及瓊芳登。</p>
<p>我覺得「情海妬潮」是水準綫左右的作品，希爾頓不能脫俗。</p>
<p>同甘共苦</p>
<p>比之史丹培克，希爾頓當然遜色，但是他眞的是一個作家，作品中沒有輝煌和光華，却有純眞和明麗。「同甘共苦」是一張優秀的影片，或就絕不在「左拉傳」之下。是和威爾廉薩洛楊的「人類的喜劇」鼻息悠關的故事，史丹培克從來不在夢想的圈子裏打轉，「怒火之花」到如今他一直追求人性的本質。「同甘共苦」的背景和「邊城壯士」一樣是一個海濱的小鎮，米高梅公司勇敢的嘗試，把流浪漢也搬上了銀幕，在輕快的Tempo下表現一角人生。狡獪式光棍的典型的創造得未曾有。導演維多茀烈敏的手法流麗新頴，無瑕可指，不愧有「亂世佳人」那樣的作品。史本塞屈賽演來爐火純靑，自然中寓有深刻，眞是淋漓痛快，約翰迦斐爾和亞金泰米洛夫都能瞭解其中之味，有特出的表現。海蒂拉瑪的戲不多，導演深知她的怯弱，儘力讓她顯露了眼睛的光艷。畫面幽美，從頭到尾都有風景，更加使「同甘共苦」成爲一張眞正的文藝片！</p>
<p>沙場喋血</p>
<p>小泉八雲說一切磨難吾人雖極端厭惡，然都是助長吾人的智慧的。桑姆郝斯頓便是歷經磨難培養智慧的人。「沙塲喋血」也許是他的一部英烈史，可是四五年前看過的片子，往回想，稀稀疏疏的一片含糊，想不起李却狄克斯所飾的郝斯頓在戰陣裏有多少英雄氣槪，只迷矇地記得迫於親命下嫁的貴族千金愛麗如何和他破裂，正是他當選連任州長之夕，郝斯頓演說台下的一排燈火，搖晃了他喋血的一生，映黯了沙塲的鐵蹄狼烟。郝斯頓的悲哀，至今我還依稀記得。</p>

<h3>改進「文藝茶話會」</h3>
<p>— 華林·陳承蔭·徐仲年</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>仲年兄鑒：</p>
<p>弟以爲「文藝茶話會」有研完之必要。最好你星期六下午到　雪園商量商量。弟以爲個別談話，不必講演。最要緊者，要預先約定人，有一二節目足矣：音樂歌唱；或是帶一二作品來，品題品題。多約眷屬參加，更要緊。空氣宜和緩，不可太緊張。兄以爲然乎？　弟華林拜上。十一月三日。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>春苔仲年二兄：</p>
<p>「文藝茶話會」舉行了二次，我多少有點感想，寫出來和你們二位談談。</p>
<p>也許世故多了一點，常覺得凡是一個集合，多少要給一點與人，否則或者有人會覺得空虛。其實世上多少事，虛虛實實，全是主觀的。所以六根淸淨的和尙，還要因柴米操心。但是我們想把這「文藝茶話會」集合得有聲有色，似乎需要一點似的。</p>
<p>這又是什麼呢？從前有一個刋物，氣味相投的都可有文章發表。現在是不能立刻辦到，但不妨努力一下。</p>
<p>此外似乎可以提倡一下的，不妨每次開會，排一些節目。譬如備一點紙張畫具，愛畫善書的不妨當塲揮毫，作爲贈送也好，留在會裏作爲基金亦好。喜歡唱唱的，不妨預備一琴一笛，如顧仲彝趙景深兄均可以約幾個曲家來參加。中間有許多詩人，亦好出其絕作，朗誦一下。這些都可以試辦的。</p>
<p>我們不希望這個會有多少機械作用，但如果想使之有生氣，常常從這個會裏得些什麼回去，不妨幹一下。個人感覺如此，不知兄等以爲然否？</p>
<p>如果這是可行的，會的內容比較充實，朋友也可多了。凡是文藝界的人都集合在此（當然是比較的），我們這個無目的底集合，無意中有了什麼目的似的，當然除了政治。</p>
<p>多事的人終是多事的，只要不太流俗，不與政治接觸，我望二兄提倡一下，我只能當一個龍　。　弟蔭頓首。三日晚。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>林，蔭兩兄：</p>
<p>大函先後拜讀，並且給春苔看過：對於兩位的高見，我們完全　同。</p>
<p>「文　茶話會」復興後閒過兩次，參加者均極踴躍。如果第二次人數比較少些，乃因爲第二次在五層樓酒家，換了第一，二，三號　，本來很容易找，可是有某校在　前開會，橫擋住了，只得多轉兩個　，由廚房前面走：於是「茶座」並比第一次寬大而幽凈，却有苦干人因找不着而减少了。我碰到新茶友吳秀野先生，他就是找不着地方面走的中間一個。又如我的外甥諸啓梧君，領了六，七位友人，趕來參加，却誤入某　的校友席，花了比我們多了三倍以上的代價，莫明其　地吃了一頓！我想下一次的　話會還用那三隻　，索性固定了，　須進出　善，參加者決計不會少的。</p>
<p>這兩次的成績，平心而論，至少可給七十五分，只可惜「嚴　」了些！嚴肅，非吾人之所願，正如林兄所說：「空氣宜和緩，不可太緊張一。推究其故，有三種因素造成這個嚴肅：（一）就　神上論，我們這批老茶友似乎吃了</p>
<p>「世事洞明皆學問，人　　　即文章」的虧，我們沒有十四年前那般天眞，舉止言外比前恃重，於是情感不奔放了；（二）就物質土論，戰後的生活比戰前困難得多，我們這班弄筆桿的人難免有些心事，於是難於盡情；（三）就年齡上論，我們這批舊茶友都巳是「而視茫茫，而髮蒼蒼，而齒牙動搖」的半老頭子了，年齡輕的新茶友見了我們總有些不自在；他們面臨如花之年，正好談愛情，而我們中間，除了華林，已無此興緻也！然而，假之以時日，這三種因素都可克服。下次我打算索性請幾位年高德劭的前輩先生來參加：在他們面前，我們可以覺得年輕了二十年！</p>
<p>是的，每次茶話會之前，必先有所準備。其實，十四年前，我們也舉行過小規模的畫展，音樂會，遠足等等。除了這種種之外，我們還可以舉行很有意義的參觀。譬如這一次劉永純博士參加了我們的「文藝茶話會」；下次或另一次，我們就去參觀劉博士主持的巴士德學院，請他領導我們，爲我們解釋：增長見識，豈不是好？我們也可以參觀「新」，「申」兩報館；也可以參觀商務印書館和中華書局；也可以參觀拍電影，烘餅乾（當年洗冠生先生曾經請我們大嚼夾心餅乾和冰淇淋），等等。以我們集體的力量，可以當得「交際廣闊」四個字：我們何愁沒有看，沒有聽，甚至沒有吃？問題在乎要有人肯跑腿；若論跑腿，兩位老哥和春苔以及小區區都是一等一！</p>
<p>說到刋物，我們的「與刋」不是沒有，也不在少數；只可惜缺乏了我們自己的「文藝茶話」，力量不能集中！我正在設法復刋，務請諸位老兄帮忙。照目下的市價，大槪三百萬元可印十萬字。復次，以前生活便宜，爲了興趣，可以養務編輯，可以義務寫稿；現今通貨膨脹，正眞「時者金也」，爲了肚子，不可不略有點綴。如果我們自己沒有力量，只得向日報進攻，先辦一個週刋再說。</p>
<p>除了友誼外，——友誼是「文藝茶話會」的魂靈，——「文藝茶話會」應當具備積極的利他作用：我想起了年齡比我們輕的茶友。赴會的年長茶友，只有一個例外（那是小區區），都是文藝界的權威：他們何不敎導敎導小弟弟們呢？所以，儘管「文藝茶話會」按期照常舉行，我們也可以舉辦有系統的「學術講座」，組織名符其實的「靑年寫作指導委員會」，設立業餘的「畫苑」，甚而籌備劇團等等。我們所富有的是無「貝」之「才」，所缺乏的是有「貝」之「財」：如果大家努力，集合些基金，補其所缺，那就十全十美了。</p>
<p>我和社會直接周旋了十有六年，十六年的經騐使我變作開明的樂觀者，積極的懷疑主義信徒。我有鐵般的意志，牛馬的精神：足供老兄等和諸位茶友的驅遣！　弟仲年拜上。三五，十一，五，星期二。</p>
<h3>古典期作品</h3>
<p>— 畢伽沙</p>
<h3>畫壇隨憶錄</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>大千居士，自謂目能見鬼。或問鬼狀。曰：鬼具人形之氣體而已。晝夜出現，隨處有之，見人迅避，　狀可哂。有時猝不及防，被人衝散，歷時稍久，氣漸　棄，重復舊觀。每見兩人迎面而來，各謀避讓，往往左右相並者數。此尋常習見之事，其中實有鬼在。屢試不爽。</p>
<p>大千寓嘉善時，眞一舊屋殊寬敞，陰氣森煞。嘗爲余言，一日未明即起，足出房門，即　一鬼。貌似素識，一時不能憶其姓氏。朝餐旣畢，忽猛省得之。詭言欲製新衣，命僕召縫工某甲。僕歸　命，甲已於半月前病歿。大千默識於心，不敢爲家人告。其言雖鑿鑿，余終不敢信也。</p>
<p>齊白石年八十六矣。十年前猶有健妾，且有嬌兒。此老畫餘，輒以弄兒爲樂。手握糖果，遠擲於地，令兒趨拾，以博歡笑。</p>
<p>余嘗隨白石出遊。白石　　幣數百枚，見道旁乞丐，一一與之。遠見衣衫襤褸之徒，必使車夫追喚至前，問明爲丐，始畀一枚。坐是點者紛集，輪流複乞。白石不暇應付，乃拋所有，使羣丐爭取。白石睹狀甚樂，路人亦莫不　腹。</p>
<p>白石幼習木工，見賞於王壬秋先生，始從問業。其畫夙具異秉，自成一家，原不足怪。所怪者乃其所爲詩歌，亦頗不惡；樊山老人嘗選其佳作，付諸影印，雖格律上不免小疵，大致眞情流露，耐人尋味。白石對其舊業，從不諱飾，嘗介余謁養寗陳散原先生，見面即稱「我是沒有讀過書的。」散老聞語不知如何作答，沈思有頃，始答曰「惟其幼未讀書，能臻此境，益令人拜服不已。」白石之坦白率眞，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>報載溥心畬飛京開畫展，主席召見，時論榮之。心畬雖屬王孫，絕無貴族習氣，卜　萬壽山之介壽堂，以書畫自遺。原居恭王府，亦有假山花木之勝，戰前即以貧困　去。抗戰以後，恃賣畫爲生，生計益窘。王揖唐屢欲畀以偽職，皆被婉拒。高風亮節，舉世同欽。心畬不僅於揖唐克敏薄其所爲，即於偽帝溥儀，不極端反對。對日寇之　暴，尤言之切齒，偶與論國事，服　蔣委員長之爲人，以爲國家民族，非抗戰不能挽救，最後勝利，終當獲之，愛國之殷，溢於言表。世人僅以淡泊自　之畫家視之，蓋未能洞察心畬之肺腑也。今抗戰勝利，天日重光；心畬開畫展於首都，實含有無窮之意義。主席對此忠貞畫士，　召慰勉，心畬亦足以自豪矣。</p>
<p>黃賓虹先生今年八十有三，畢生精力盡瘁於金石書畫，論其造詣精深，當世殆無有能勝之者。賓虹旅居北平有年，所眞之屋，近落囤戶之手，遽增租金數百倍，賓虹不能支囤戶百般辱之，逼其遷讓，賓虹不堪其擾，只得遷地爲良矣。頃荷枉書牢騷滿紙，丁茲亂世，安分良民，幾無立足之地，聞之不勝憤慨。賓虹畫山水，夙負盛名；不知其偶作花卉，亦取法高古，不同流俗。近見其畫杜鵑一枝，古拙可喜，賓虹自謂習花卉三十年，尙未有成，不敢問世，然未嘗一日間斷。前輩冶藝之勤，豈後生小子所能夢見耶！</p>
<p>今人評畫輒重虛名，其實無名畫家，　未必全無可取。二十年前，見有余盛明者，畫梅花取法巢林王几，淡雅欲出塵　之表，嗣於朋好處見之，一談大契。余君貧甚，其畫雖取潤低康，無人問津；大千深賞其畫，每爲補綴數筆，提高　値，頃刻即有人收購，余君受惠不少，然亦以見世人重名不重實也。</p>

<h3>桑</h3>
<p>— 茨以</p>
<p>江南的春天和秋天，姑娘們輕婉的歌喉，唱出採桑曲：</p>
<p>朝採桑來晚採桑，</p>
<p>阿儂整日爲蠶忙，</p>
<p>但願　兒長得快，</p>
<p>早早結兩繭滿　。</p>
<p>傍晚，斜陽染抺天邊，原野裏騰起瀰漫的薄霧；無盡無垠的桑田，洋溢着綠的芳香，無盡無垠的桑田，映對着半天紅霞；晚風拂動了姑娘們的頭髮，姑娘們浮着笑臉走向田野。</p>
<p>歌聲，應和着笑語聲，全部落入晚風中。</p>
<p>捲起袖口來，不嫌麻煩的從枝頭上摘下一片片肥胖的桑葉，霧重了，斜陽也燒紅了殘霞；於是姑娘們哼呀哼的携着筐簍，蹣跚的踏上歸途，快活裏忘去了疲乏。</p>
<p>春期接連着秋期，江南多少姑娘在養　的歲月裏成長。她們熟悉養蠶的技術，也深知育蠶對於自己的補益。雖然養蠶是一種挺忙碌的工作；除篩，飼育，採桑，學要早睡早起注意寒暖和安全。但是，當採滿了簍筐的雪白的收穫時，會感到安慰和愉悅的。</p>
<p>江南的姑娘們是喜愛春三月秋九月溫援凉爽的養蠶季節的—對着江南水鄕這一片寗靜繁茂綠油油的桑田，更有誰不喜歡呢？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　88</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>（這並不是一種神話，奇蹟，却是國術裏面一種手法。同時懂得訣竅的人，都知道狗的全身弱點，就在這耳根上面，祇要手重，敏挺，擊法準確，一下擊中地方，就可立時將狗擊斃）。</p>
<p>那隻狗剛一躺下，虎弟一伏身，抓住　的後腿一拖，順勢就地打了兩個旋子，一鬆手把狗對準石牆外面扔去，那狗被扔起一丈多高，向石牆外飛去，只聽見澎的一聲，大約是落在溪水裏了。剛把狗扔去　虎弟又上前，一雙手把地上躺着那個鬼子的兩隻腿撈起，大約也想照扔狗一樣，如法泡製。我忙低聲　住虎弟。</p>
<p>虎弟知道我要檢查那　伙一下，便在那尸身旁邊，拾起了鬼子的電筒。我安置了手槍和劍，向大路兩頭　子一下，又呌虎弟警戒着；接過　筒，把光逼得極近的看了看見那像伙的身體半側半俯的躺在地上，頭部却是向後拗住，咨牙靈齒，顯得極少猙獰可怖！知道　弟已經把他的　骨拗斷了。看情形虎弟大約　　我喝叱的聲音，驚覺之後，則從　樹後　　了過來，從他背後　進，用重手法把他的頭　向後拗斷。我扳轉他的身體，把他的符號扯出來一看，上面是佐佐木源二郎，上士兵。</p>
<p>我們把這傢伙的尸身，照狗一樣安排過了，隨即順着叢林，朝北走去。過了第四座建築的地界，我們重又從叢林　鑽了進來。原來打算逗遛一下，　看營房中那些傢伙，作何舉動，但現在因把那佐佐木源巡哨弄掉，恐怕不久即要有事發生，只略略看了看形勢，不願多事躭攔，便從黑影裏渡過了空塲，經過那第四座四層樓房子，到了主體建築的後面。</p>
<p>我們找到一個暗角，藏住了身子，再回頭看那一排一排的營房，最前一兩排，有些人影走動；除了偶然一兩下笑聲，夾　廣播的日本　樂歌唱，傳送出來之外，並不聽見大聲嘩笑。或高談　論的喧　。心下却也暗暗佩服倭軍，雖在自由休息時間裏，仍能守着良好的秩序！</p>
<p>朝北，黑沉沉地，正是一望沒有邊際的空地。問問虎弟，這片空地，有什麼特別可注意的地方，虎弟搖了搖頭，說「大槪就是那老　說的飛機降落塲」，却並無機塲建築，僅僅地面土色，黃一塊黑一塊，大約是做出的防空偽裝。</p>
<p>我們沿着這主要建築，朝西略略滑進一段，驀然覺得脚底有些震動。我伏在地上，貼耳聽了一聽，知道附近必有巨型機器，正在轉動。再進幾步，見這主要保壘的地　牆脚土，一路都有小方洞，每個洞約莫有一尺多見方大小，剛剛貼近洞口，就覺　而有一股地室熱氣，沖了出來，並且隱隱　得有規律的馬達　動聲，然而不見些微燈光。我想這裏面大槪就是這全區的發電問。上下左右看看，却又不見一根電綫，大約北地土燥，所有電綫，竟是埋在地下的？</p>
<p>這裏已經可以看得出，西邊一帶空塲，和東面一帶營房相對的地方，重重疊疊，堆得山丘一般，不知是些什麼東西，一問虎弟，他把手籠住眼光，像我們普通人遮信陽光遠着的神情，注視了一會，告訴我說，「前而堆着些　桶東西，怕是火藥吧；後面那小山一樣的，全是煤塊。那圓桶前面，還有很多大小卡車汽車。</p>
<p>虎弟大約不認識汽油桶，所以猜想那些圖桶都是火　。我一面前進，心下一面打　主意：我們兩人，在這禁衛區內，大　最多只能再躭擱一半個小時：因爲日本鬼子，最高的道德，就是有秩序；他們旣經失踪了一個巡哨，沒有不被發覺的道理，一經發覺，當然就有一番大騷動，大搜查；我們那時，不見得還能隱藏得住。</p>

<h3>思</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「靜坐常思已過，閒談莫論人非」。這兩件事都很難辦到。可見做人不大容易。</p>
<p>上海人的社會生活實在太繁複了，坐而能靜，心靜，四圍環境靜，一萬人中能有幾人？每天忙於柴米油鹽或汽卓洋房，滿腦子算計，如何能靜？即使你一塵不染罷，隔壁人家不是播音機傳來流行歌曲，就是劈拍的麻雀脾聲。怎能讓你有片刻寗謐呢？</p>
<p>坐而不能靜，更談不上「思」了。即使思，怕也不能思到巳過上來，因之，我們大家都在渾渾噩噩中過日子，祇是一天一天地在應付今天，生活行爲上的缺點，很少能反省與改進的了。</p>
<p>我往往有個鄕愿的想法，倘使每個人在臨睡之前，坐在床上將一天言行閉目瞑思一香，自然地會感想萬千，懊喪，懺悔，痛苦，煩惱，這些成分將佔絕大多數，良知就不會泯滅了。</p>
<p>可是。腦袋在肩上祇是成爲一種員担的人，爬上床便呼呼入夢，這等人該可羨慕的嗎？</p>
<h3>神奇的怪事</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>……譯自「科學文摘」十月號……</p>
<p>無疑的，世界上最最神奇的一件怪事，是所謂印度繩索戲法的秘密了。理由是很簡單——因爲也許那戲法是從來沒有演出過。</p>
<p>變戲法的人是假定立在一塊空地中，四圍完全被觀衆們所包圍着。他拿出一根繩子，丟到半空中去。假使戲法變得對的話，那繩子就弔在那裏，垂掛地，筆直的。</p>
<p>一個孩子助手，便抓着繩子爬上去，直到他爬到了頂端，那變戲法的人一念咒語，那孩子便不見了。須臾，那孩子的肉，一塊塊的從火上墮下來——上那情景的確是很凄慘的，那變戲法的人一些也不畏懼地把那些碎塊的骨肉收集攏來，他確定了其中一塊也不缺少之後，就放在一只蔴袋中，再說了一句魔術的話，那孩子便從蔴袋中走了出來，活潑潑地絲毫沒有傷害。</p>
<p>這故事經過了幾百年，跟隨着時間，也在進步着。那是在公元一三五五年，中國最先記載這件事——報吿這件事的男人說，那件遭遇使他很受刺激，看了後似于不能不喝酒的。（譯者按：這故事彷彿是在蒲松齡的聊齋誌異中的，聊齋誌異產生於淸初，距今的三百年，所以所謂公元一三五五年，和不能不喝酒的話，大槪是外國人的誤解。）二百年後，那件事在德國轟動了。最後，回到了這故事的老家，印度·於是，每個人都知道那件呌做印度繩索戲法的事了。</p>
<p>這戲法有沒有準確的調査過？有的。魔術圈神奇委員會決定了做一個不折不扣的實地調查。那是遠地的工作，調査員們就被見派出去，到印度去詢問那些看見過這件事的三千觀衆。</p>
<p>有許多人自稱知道這事的秘密。一個女人說，這是用一隻細長的布袋，假裝是繩子，那布袋的旁邊，有一隻變換的開關，一根極長的棒塞進了布袋，於是那繩子就好像是筆直的掛在半空中了，伹是，她沒有說出來，那孩　　　　失蹤的——像許多其　人一樣。</p>
<p>有人說，他使羣衆完全都催眠了；然而，催眠專家說那不可能，一羣觀衆是不會都被催眠倒的。又有人說，他看見那戲法的，不過是在一條狹窄的街上，兩旁的房屋是有走廊的。那變戲法的人用燃料使空中起了一層烟幕，因此不可能看見繩子的頂端。然而，這種情景是不合所說的規則的。</p>
<p>另外的一個男人說，他看見那戲法的，伹是到得晚了，那總子早已掛在半空中了。</p>
<p>幾個印度陸軍長官出了很重的懸賞，祇要有任何人應徵出來表演一下。——伹是，那獎金始終動也不動的保留着。所以，這神奇怪事的秘密也保留着——始終沒有被揭發過。結論是：一定根本沒有這回事的。</p>
<h3>路牌</h3>
<p>在前租界時代，路牌皆以鐵鑄，旣堅且固，又不易汚損。敵僞改易路名，始用木牌，大約以鐵不易得，即舊牌亦捆載而去矣。字跡如出一手，作顏體。勝利後，字用新美術體，甚大方。惟木牌易朽，玩童好弄，塗改甚易，此其缺點也。</p>
<h3>猶太人與上海</h3>
<p>— 石靜</p>
<p>猶太人大批的到中國不過短短的五六年，但巳使國人普遍地發生不好的感覺，因爲他們沒有國族的觀念，現實將他們鍛練成一副自私無情，唯利是圖的頭腦。他們在每天的早晨，除了主持家務的老太太之外，閉門家居的可說絕無僅有，每個猶太人都挾着皮包，提着籐籃，離開家向大都市（上海）的心臟去，除賣零星小物及大塊呢絨衣料外，還在上海的銀行錢莊區套利搶帽子，對小額的股票尤其不遺餘力。</p>
<p>中國人暴發後，大都有一種僥倖享福之心，而精明的猶太人却絕對有持久的貪忍性；他們可以二只麵包充一日三餐，他們也會取得少數盈利後就急於歸返的。久之，這樣就充實了他們的經濟力。中國的財主有了經濟實力就畏於進取，而猶太人有了實力就愈能發揮；大的在四五年前吧，上海開始人類間最惡劣的囤積之風，那時西藥被人大批搜刮，呢絨也爲人奇貨可居，罐頭食品竟然搜索乾凈，一切物資都被人操縱，物價漲風無法抑平。後來確悉猶太人在道過程中，曾全力以赴的盡了旁敲側擊之功的。</p>
<p>猶太在上海立定脚跟之後，更駕輕就熟，再接再厲，他們對房屋也動了腦筋。從前的霞飛路是他們的起點，漸漸的虹口竟囤得像他們的鄕土了。從前以數萬元（僞幣）盤進的一幢店房，現在非數百萬法幣盤出不可。這使猶太人的經濟能力更築有堅強的堡壘了；但要使食下去的果實得以溶化，他們唯有使偏僻的地區閃電式的繁榮。偏東的荒蕪之區竟如願的興在起來，於是拋出扒進，猶太人對上海的經濟命脈更來了總攻擊，大批的囤積食糧，盡量的搜羅民間食品，一方面掩護式的開起食品店來，另一方面强化操縱，多數成了上海奇跡似的富翁。</p>
<p>現在社會商業道德上最可恥的是「商品模仿」，有了盛名的商品往往就有模仿這商品的貨物在市上出現；但猶太人不僅是模仿，簡直是抄襲。他們一模一樣製造成名的香水，美國烟，日用品等，並且拚命抬高價値混以出售。應市門售的貨物常然質料劣得無可再劣，但也居然憑着售價低廉爲號召，形成市上大衆樂購的東西。</p>
<p>猶太人在上海「勝任愉快」的發揮天才，毫無疑問的是上海中國民衆經濟上一重威脅，怎樣抑平物價爲當局所關心，怎樣監視猶太人的活動情形，也該是當務之急！</p>
<p>寓言</p>
<h3>神·強權·公理</h3>
<p>— 古董</p>
<p>有一次，强權和公理在神的寳殿上相遇了。神說：「我用了你們，駕御着世上的人民，現在，你們把以往的成績，吿訴給我吧：」</p>
<p>於是，公理踏着疲倦的步伐，申訴說：</p>
<p>「神呀，我領了你的聖旨，降到人間，把你的福音，傳給世上；我讓奴隸們得到了休息，我使乞丐們得到了救濟，貓兒不再怕狗，狼也不再欺侮兎子，人類脫離了戰爭，動物獲得了解放，我使大地充滿了蓬勃，宇宙充滿了歡在。可是，神啊！不料隔了不久，奴隸們病了，貓狗反叛了，狼追着兎子，人又被迫着去戰爭，而人們的臉上，倒反顯着喜氣，這豈不是公理也被反抗了嗎？」</p>
<p>强權接着獰笑地說：</p>
<p>「呵…我接了公理的任，我讓人們戰爭，我使狼吃兎子，貓怕狗，狗怕老虎，我也讓奴隸們工作，讓他們吃鞭子。唉！神，我去的時候，大地雖然一片平和，可是，奴隸們皺着眉，兎子打着瞌睡。我去了之後，賤脾氣的奴隸却甘心地吃着鞭子，富賈們更張開了大嘴笑着，兎子自認爲是狼的食物。弱肉强食，成了人世的公理！你看看我駕御着的世界，雖然黑暗而慘酷，但是，郤合了大家的本意。」</p>
<p>强權退下了寳殿，公理等待着神最後的評判。</p>
<p>神說：「唉！你呌我怎麽說呢？强權不是比你更好了百倍嗎？你去吧，人的世界並不需要着公理呢！」</p>
<p>星期雜談　「我想出嫁」的共鳴</p>
<p>編者按：三日本刊載了一篇「我想出嫁」的文章後、引起許多男女靑年的共鳴。在目前，一切都受經濟因素的支配，不知多少男女韶華虛度，男的不敢娶，女的不易嫁；「老小姐的問題」確乎値得討論。這里所發表的幾封信，都出於坦白誠懇的靑年，我們是把這件事當做靑年問題看，並非以此來迎合靑年的趣味，所以題目雖引人注意，而內容却相富嚴肅呢！</p>
<h3>我也想出嫁</h3>
<p>— 娟</p>
<p>讀了「我想嫁」一文，使我非常感動。我和任女士正是同病相憐。我也書怕做「老小如，」我相信我比任女士還要着急，因爲我的年紀比她大。我巳經大學畢業了五年。而且做了五年事的「老小姐」了。雖然半生將過，還有半生不是隨便了結它算數，可是父母不能養我一世。職業不能長做一生。尤其是在這不景氣的時候，小職員隨時有被裁去的可能，而在目前女子職業還是被目爲「花瓶」的社啊裘，年紀大了，除了做敎員和護士之外，商業機關有誰要妳？</p>
<p>我要出嫁！我不是想把自己生活的重担加在丈夫的身上。我是英文又學士，我能翻譯，會打字，可以幫助丈夫做一切寫字間的工作。我想出嫁，精神可以有安慰，年老可以有依靠，同時可以了却父母的心願。免被親戚朋友恥笑我永遠是個嫁不去的「老小姐」！</p>
<h3>想嫁又怕嫁</h3>
<p>— 敏</p>
<p>我當然也想出嫁，便是在目前「大窮」與「大亂」的時代，一對男女如沒有雜特家庭的經濟能力，如不能把我們的後一代，培植得比我們更好，更强；那麼就出了嫁有何幸福？這年頭身家淸白，道德高尙的男子，大都很窮，我並非怕他們不能予我享受，但最低的生活程度總要維持。就爲了這許多小姐老了，許多小姐想嫁而怕嫁。我曾經說：「這年頭，必須具有犧牲決心的，才能出嫁；」但是，我可以犧牲自己，我不能犧牲我們的後一代。兒女的智識，健康，人格，不能不賴有充裕經濟力量。</p>
<p>因此，我想嫁而怕嫁。</p>
<h3>知彼並知己</h3>
<p>— 哲</p>
<p>「我想出嫁」，這是一個令人如何觸目的標題，在這里，我不得不佩服作渚的膽大，能言人所不願言。雖然，現社會的文明已達到登峯造極的階段，可是，上下古今數千年來，尤其是女子，有幾人能將私蓄心底的隱痛肯亦裸裸的提出的呢！這次，作者總算把許多希望嫁而尙未找到對象的女同胞們潛藏在內心的苦痛，一言道破，這又是令人感到如何痛快的一件事啊</p>
<p>「出嫁」，並不是出路，我認爲女子的要求出嫁與男子的要求結婚，並無二致的，這純然是基於彼此的生理和心理的以及整個生活上的要求。所謂「君子之値，造端乎夫婦；」也正說明結婚的不可逃避。我極端反對獨身主義，而坐使靑春不再。至於對於任小姐所提出的「我想出嫁！」究竟如何解決呢！這不僅她個人在殷切的盼望，恐怕凡具有如此情形的女子，都想社會對她們這一羣能有一個確切的指示：我以爲找對象並不太難，只要不具偏見，能够知彼知己即能百戰百勝。我們看一般女子所以會走上「老小姐」路上去的，多半是因爲自視太高而弄得高不成低不就了。</p>
<p>這是老調，但却是常情。</p>
<h3>人生的開始</h3>
<p>— 惠標</p>
<p>「男大當婚，女大當嫁；」愛情是人生的一種需要，Dupuy說：「婚姻是男子的人生的一個段落，而是女子的人生的開始；」</p>
<p>但在目前的中國社會，婚姻制度仍在新舊交替的階段，男婚女嫁，確難處理，我希望能有正當妥善的辦法，由社會來舉辦婚姻介紹。</p>

<h3>Various Parties Agree to Resume Subcommittee Meetings; Comprehensive Talks Held for the First Time; Meeting to Reconvene Today to Discuss National Assembly Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] At 10 a.m. on the 9th, the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and prominent figures from society gathered at the Bank of Communications to discuss the Chairman's statement of the 8th, particularly regarding the National Assembly and the draft constitution. At noon, the entire group went to Wuyi Road for a luncheon hosted by Sun Ke. Attendees included all government representatives, representatives of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and prominent figures from society in Nanjing, as well as Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan from the Communist Party. After the meal, informal comprehensive talks were held, and Stuart and Chuan Jingbo were also invited to attend. The ambassador, during the meeting, expressed words of encouragement, stating briefly: "Today marks the first gathering of all parties. We should think in terms of construction and avoid acting impulsively." After the meeting, Sun Ke issued a statement: the Three-Person Group, the Informal Five-Person Group, the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group, and the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee can all resume meetings. Various parties not in power have expressed their agreement, but they hope the government will reconsider the date of the National Assembly. At 5 p.m., the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others gathered again at the Bank of Communications to discuss ways to facilitate the smooth progress of various meetings. In addition, during the meeting at Sun's residence, Zhou Enlai expressed his views on the National Assembly, believing that it must be discussed by all parties.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Government representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and others visited the Chairman at 5 p.m. on the 9th to report on the informal comprehensive talks held that afternoon, leaving around 7 p.m. Subsequently, Wang Shijie met at his residence with Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, and Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, and others who arrived in Nanjing on the 9th. It was decided that the second informal comprehensive talks would be held at Sun Ke's residence at 3 p.m. on the 10th. It is reported that the focus of the discussion on the 9th was the date of the National Assembly and the draft constitution. Some people believe that the National Assembly will proceed with the opening ceremony as scheduled, but the date for the start of deliberations may be slightly delayed, and negotiations will be conducted during this interim period. A decision on this matter may be made at the meeting on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Luo Longji, Zuo Shunsheng, and Miao Jiaming visited Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 9th, and then Zhang Shenfu and others visited Sun Ke at 8:30 p.m., returning to Lan Jiazhuang at 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Wang Bingnan, of the Communist Party delegation, went to the U.S. Embassy at 11 a.m. on the 9th to explain his views on the Chairman's statement of the 8th, leaving after talking for half an hour. Also, Special Envoy Marshall instructed Colonel Ke E this morning to deliver a letter to the Communist Party delegation, the contents of which are unknown. Regarding the government's ceasefire order issued on the 8th, when reporters inquired with the Communist Party spokesperson this evening, they said: "We did not receive any prior notice, nor do we know anything about it afterward. The Communist Party's operations are entirely self-defense, so there is no need to issue a ceasefire order to stop." However, regarding the ceasefire, Zhou Enlai will visit Special Envoy Marshall for talks in the coming days. The content of the Communist Party's reply to Chairman Chiang's eight points is very simple, stating only that some issues were discussed with Wu and Shao in Shanghai, and that the Communist Party's view that Chairman Chiang's eight points should be based on negotiations was conveyed by Zhou himself.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] After receiving Wang Bingnan this morning, Stuart visited Special Envoy Marshall with Chuan Jingbo at noon and had lunch together. It is reported that he conveyed the Communist Party's views on Chairman Chiang's statement of the 8th. At 2 p.m., he went to Sun Ke's residence for a conversation of about fifteen minutes, then returned to the embassy. He also received You Yongchang of the Zhonghe Party at 4:30 p.m. for half an hour.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Orders Received Everywhere; Subordinates Instructed to Comply</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] A spokesperson for the Xing Yuan (Commander in Chief's Office) told reporters on the 9th that the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang yesterday has been received by the Xing Yuan and that troops in all areas have been strictly ordered to execute it. When asked by reporters how to handle situations where National Army forces were attacked, the spokesperson consulted with Chief of Staff Wang Hongzhao and replied: "The ceasefire order must be executed, but the National Army will not be beaten without resistance."</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 9th] The ceasefire order issued by the Chairman on the 8th prompted several newspapers here to issue special editions after 10 p.m., easing the heavy and uneasy hearts of the mountain city in the cold wind and drizzling rain. The Chongqing Xing Yuan received the ceasefire order at noon on the 9th and immediately notified all subordinates to implement it conscientiously.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 9th] It is reported that after receiving Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order, the Jiangsu Provincial Military and Political Office urgently telegraphed all front-line commanders in northern Jiangsu and local administrative authorities to comply, and it is also reported that the National Army advancing towards Yancheng will stop at Liuzhuang, awaiting further orders. It is generally predicted that if the communist forces in Yancheng and Funing do not take the opportunity to attack the National Army, the war situation in northern Jiangsu is expected to ease.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 9th] Chairman of Shandong Province, Wang Yaowu, received the ceasefire order and has telegraphed all National Army and security forces in the province to comply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th] After receiving the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang on the 8th, the Second War Zone Command and the Shanxi Provincial Government have separately instructed their subordinates to strictly comply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters received the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang at noon on the 9th and immediately notified all subordinate units to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Liang Shuming on Ceasefire: Situation May Improve or Stagnate</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, told reporters at his private residence in Beiping on the 9th: "After the government issued the ceasefire order, the situation may improve, but it may also become more rigid and difficult to resolve. Because the government's proclamation has made everything fixed and not easily flexible. A ceasefire is naturally a good thing, but in the government's proclamation, many political issues, such as the reservation of seats for various parties in the National Assembly and the constitutional issue, are inconsistent with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and problems are sure to arise." When asked by reporters whether the Communist Army would also cease fire since the government had clearly ordered a ceasefire, Liang replied: "That depends on how the Communist Party decides its own policies." Liang also said: "Zhou Enlai previously advocated convening a meeting of the Military Three-Person Group. Now that the government has announced the convening of the Military Three-Person Group under these conditions, whether the Communist Party will participate will become a difficult problem for Zhou Enlai to ponder."</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai's Remarks</h3>
<p>Hoping to Eliminate the Basic Causes of Conflict</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] Zhang Junmai issued a statement regarding the ceasefire order issued by the Chairman, saying that today's ceasefire order is indeed a satisfactory request for all parties, but although the ceasefire order has been issued, it is still necessary to further seek the elimination of the basic causes of the conflict and how to eliminate them. For this purpose, in the political aspect, there are the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference supported by all parties, and in the military aspect, there are the two points of the signed reorganization plan. It is still hoped that both points and all parties will unreservedly seek their implementation, laying a foundation for peace and comforting the hopes of the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying's Remarks</h3>
<p>Communist Army Not Bound by Ceasefire Order</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] After Chairman Chiang issued the ceasefire order, reporters visited Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative of the Military Mediation Department, on the morning of the 9th, and first asked whether the Communist Party's actions would also be bound by this ceasefire order since the government had issued a ceasefire order. Ye replied that they were not bound by it. He also said: "Since the government has interpreted past military actions as self-defense, it will continue to defend itself if necessary in the future. In this case, this road is not a road to peace, but a road to war." When asked by reporters whether the Nanjing peace talks would continue under the current circumstances, Ye replied: "It depends on whether there is any development in the outside discussions in Nanjing. As of this morning, Ye had not received instructions from Zhou Enlai in Nanjing and Yan'an. The Military Mediation Department has also not received new tasks. On the morning of the 9th, Ye was studying Chairman Chiang's ceasefire proclamation with his senior staff.</p>

<h3>White Snow Beyond the Great Wall</h3>
<p>— A Reporter's Inspection of Jin, Sui, and Chahar</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 9th] A group of twenty-two Chinese and foreign reporters, after inspecting Zhangyuan and Datong, was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on the 4th. However, due to a malfunction of the special plane and changes in the climate on the frontier, the itinerary was changed, and the opportunity was taken to inspect Jining and Guihua while waiting for the plane. At 9 a.m. on the 9th, they took a plane from the Beiping Air Force District to Guihua and then returned to Datong. They changed to the special plane that had been repaired and returned to Beijing at 3 p.m. in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The reporter group departed from Beijing by special plane at 9:40 a.m. on October 31st. At 4:10 p.m., they flew to Zhangyuan, which had been recovered just twenty days earlier. Local order was restored five days after the recovery. The Temporary Political Affairs Committee of the Twelfth War Zone is now temporarily responsible for the administration of Chahar Province and Zhangyuan. It is handling various issues left by the Communist Party and resolving them smoothly in accordance with the central government's decisions.</p>
<p>The recovery of Zhangyuan has drastically changed the situation in North China. General Fu Zuoyi announced the course of the battle to the reporter group, saying: "This is a victory of the people's will and the soldiers' hatred." Jining was the site of the decisive battle. General Dong Qiwu led four divisions of troops to defeat the siege of more than 100,000 Communist troops and recovered Jining on September 14, thus relieving the siege of Datong. On November 5, they began advancing from Jining to Zhangyuan. The National Army learned that the Communist Army had deployed heavy troops along the railway line and detoured fifty li, directly attacking Zhangyuan from the northern line. The march was rapid and caught the Communist Army by surprise. At 11:50 a.m. on November 11, Zhangtan was taken without a fight, and the Communist Army set fire to the city and fled. At that time, General Sun Yunzhong's northward troops engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist Army in Huailai, achieving the effect of mutual support. After this setback, the remaining troops of the Chahar, Jin, and Sui Communist armies retreated into the Taihang Mountains. The reporters inspected the post-disaster situation in Zhangyuan, which was heartbreaking and filled with mixed feelings. The Japanese army had occupied the area for eight years and devoted itself to construction, creating an industrialized city. All the buildings have now been burned down by the Communist Army, and the huge and sophisticated machinery has been reduced to wreckage. The losses are incalculable. This kind of Communist violence has generated hatred from the depths of every person's heart. The reporters sought out the people's plight and gained a deep understanding of the Communist Party's slogans of "democracy" and "freedom." When local people answered the reporter's questions in their local dialect, they said: "Democracy" - "Alas, it's worse than autocracy!" "Freedom" - "Alas, it locks us in cages!" They do not call it the "Communist Party," but call it the "Bankruptcy Party."</p>
<p>The reporter group stayed in Zhangyuan for two days. At 4 p.m. on November 2, they flew to Datong, which had been besieged for forty-five days. Commander-in-Chief Chu Xichun and the heads of Datong party and government departments and students and civilians, a total of more than 2,000 people, lined up at the airport to welcome them, and their emotions were truly enthusiastic. Datong was besieged from August 3. Communist generals Yao Zhe, Xiao Ke, He Long, and Nie Rongzhen adopted a rotation tactic to besiege the defending troops, but they were unable to take it for a long time. Finally, they released tear gas bombs and occupied the suburban strongholds, but they were ultimately unable to break into the city. After Jining was recovered, the Communist Army's retreat route was cut off, and the military's morale was shaken. The Datong defending troops took advantage of the situation to launch a counterattack and lifted the siege on September 16. During the siege, the military and civilians cooperated with one heart, regarded death as home, were strong and unyielding, and there were many moving stories. When the Communist Army retreated, they thoroughly destroyed the Pingwang Power Plant, which was the largest in North China. The Datong Eight Coal Mines, which could produce 8,000 tons of coal per day and supply the needs of North China, now only produce 700 tons of coal per day after the destruction. The reporters went to pay their respects one by one, and sighed endlessly! On the way back to Datong, more than 300 miners and their families suddenly knelt down to the reporters and painfully recounted the disaster situation, the Communist Army's liquidation, and all kinds of atrocities in the struggle, and their voices were filled with tears as they faced the cliff of life.</p>
<p>The reporter group did not leave on the 4th. On the 5th, they took a special train on the Ping-Sui Railway to Jining for inspection, and waited for a plane to be sent from Beiping to pick them up. Jining is already on the frontier, higher in elevation than Zhangyuan, Datong, and Guihua. The cold wind was biting, and white snow was fluttering. It was already the weather of severe winter. The people who had experienced the disaster, in groups of three or five, told the reporters about their suffering. The losses they suffered during the year that the Communist Party occupied were greater than the losses they suffered during the eight years of Japanese occupation. Post-disaster relief is truly urgent.</p>
<p>The reporter group waited for a plane in Jining for two days, but the weather did not improve. On the evening of the 7th, they took a special train on the Ping-Sui Railway to Guihua again to wait for a plane. The climate there was better than in Jining. The train derailed in the middle of the journey, which can be said to be full of hardships. On the 9th, they finally boarded a plane in Guihua, transferred to Datong, and returned to Beijing. In total, the trip lasted ten days, one and a half times longer than the original schedule. The materials collected were very rich. As a result of the inspection, the true face of Communist Party cruelty was exposed to the world by Chinese and foreign reporter groups!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch, 9th] After the Communist army captured Anqiu in Shandong Province on the 7th, it was quickly recovered by reinforcing National Army troops. However, the situation in Gaomi and Jiaoxian is very tense, with the Communist army largely preparing for war, attempting to recapture the area, open up the severed corridor in eastern Shandong, and cut off the Jiaoji Railway line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao Dispatch, 9th] On the night of the 8th, outside Jiaoxian, there were over ten thousand Communist troops, including the Coastal Independent Regiments 1 and 2, five independent battalions, three assault detachments, and the Democratic National Salvation Army Independent Column, who simultaneously launched attacks, engaging in fierce fighting with the National Army stationed in Jiaoxian.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan Dispatch, 8th] Yantai is a key Communist stronghold for sea access and a vital transportation hub between Liaoning and Shandong, making it a military necessity. Although previous reports of fighting were unconfirmed, based on the large-scale troop increases by the Communist army in Jiaodong and the National Army's counterattacks, a major battle is imminent. The Communist army in Linzi and Anqiu retreated on the 7th, but the Communist army in Yexian launched fierce reinforcements and counterattacks, with intense fighting continuing in the suburbs until the 8th, and the Communist army has not yet been repelled. The Shandong National Army has recovered 35 county-level cities, accounting for more than one-third of the province. Fourteen other county governments have entered their respective county territories to conduct business.</p>
<h3>No Changes in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Large-Scale Troop Increases by the Communist Army in the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch, 9th] According to a telegram from Zhuoxian, Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Zone, and Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander, inspected the northern section of the Pinghan Railway yesterday, reaching Dingxing, the end point of the repaired section, and returning to Zhuoxian that evening, lodging in armored vehicles. As of 5:30 PM on the 9th, they were still in Jixian.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway remains largely unchanged today. The National Army is becoming more active in Yixian, and the county may be recovered before the ceasefire order takes effect. The Communist army in that area has spared no significant sacrifices in recent days, holding firmly to the dangerous mountains. After the National Army recovers Yixian, the Communist army's threat to transportation on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway will be limited. Highway transportation on the Pingbao section is smooth, and 40 vehicles arrived in Baoding from Beiping today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch, 9th] According to relevant authorities, the Communist army is massively increasing its troop presence in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway.

Their vanguard has already reached north of Hongdong and, in coordination with the Communist army in the Taiyue region, will launch a major offensive against the National Army in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, posing a significant threat to Hongdong. Currently, there are over 3,000 Communist troops in Dawangzhuang and Xiaowangzhuang in Huo County, attempting to attack Lingshi, and approximately 10,000 Communist troops preparing for war within Zhao County. To the southeast of Hongdong, there are three Communist regiments blockading transportation lines. After capturing Guoxian and Yuanping, He Long's forces in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway continued to move south, further capturing Chunmozhen and Ping She Railway Station southwest of Xinxian.</p>

<h3>Shenyang Plans to Be Reclassified as a Special Municipality; City Council Petition Delegation Flies to Nanjing to Meet with President Song</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] A petition delegation from the Shenyang City Council, including Zhang Shici, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 9th to meet with President Song, requesting that Shenyang be reclassified as a special municipality. Shenyang has a population of 1.6 million, an area of 62 square miles, and held a long-term leading position in culture, politics, and economics before September 18th. During the period under enemy and puppet control, it was designated as a heavy industrial zone, with a population of nearly 3 million, known as the second largest city in the East. Since the central government took over, Shenyang's position has become increasingly important. All central military and political organs are located here, making it the political, economic, and cultural center of the Northeast. Therefore, it fully possesses the conditions to be a municipality under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, surpassing Harbin and Dalian. In comparison to Nanjing and Shanghai, it is also comparable. However, due to its current status as an ordinary municipality, it faces difficulties in funding sources, and industrial and commercial development cannot progress. If this continues, there will be no hope for recovery, and even maintaining the status quo will be difficult. The citizens of Shenyang all hope that the government will elevate Shenyang's status and establish a foundation for the revitalization of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium Passes Five Guiding Principles; Chen Lifu Points Out the Main Problems in the Serious Economic Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was held at the Public Recreation Society from 9:00 AM on the 9th. After lunch, the five issues proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission were discussed: (1) establishing an Overseas Chinese Economic Enterprise Bureau to manage overseas Chinese economic enterprises; (2) encouraging overseas Chinese shipping merchants to develop international transportation; (3) establishing a Chinese Goods Exhibition Hall to promote domestic products; (4) strengthening financial organizations to make overseas Chinese capital more flexible; and (5) designating areas for overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and other places. All were approved in principle. Furthermore, the proposal by Pan Xulun to establish an Overseas Chinese Economic Problem Research Institute to regularly liaise with relevant government agencies, provide concrete suggestions, solve various difficulties faced by overseas Chinese, seek welfare for overseas Chinese compatriots, and jointly participate in national construction was also approved in principle.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu's Address</p>
<p>Those present today included Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Shuren, Deputy Chairman Zhou Qigang, representatives from relevant ministries, and overseas Chinese representatives from various regions, including Liu Ruxin (England), Lu Chaoran (United States), Feng Erhe (Siam), Liang Jinshan (Burma), Chen Zhaoji (Vietnam), and over 70 others. After Chairman Zhou Qigang respectfully read the will of the Founding Father, Minister Wang Yunwu delivered the first address, stating that the Kuomintang Sixth Plenary Session had resolved to convene an Overseas Chinese Economic Conference, but due to the impact of the war and transportation, it was not until today, taking advantage of the presence of representatives in Nanjing to attend the National Federation of Commerce and the National Assembly, that this meeting was convened. He hoped to use this opportunity to understand the situation of overseas Chinese returning home, find ways to assist them, and discuss how to encourage overseas Chinese to invest and participate in domestic economic construction. The main issues for the symposium are fivefold: (1) The issue of overseas Chinese economic recovery. After the victory, the government allocated 50 million US dollars to be managed by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank to provide recovery loans and fairly subsidize returning overseas Chinese in various regions. The government has always paid close attention to the interests of overseas Chinese. After the war, the situation in the Dutch East Indies was dire, and overseas Chinese suffered significant losses. The government has dispatched Special Envoy Li Dijun to offer condolences and provide relief. (2) The issue of overseas Chinese investing in the country. After the victory, national construction work is urgently needed. The resources of the Northeast, Taiwan, the Northwest, and the Southwest, in particular, need to be developed. This is a good opportunity for overseas Chinese to establish businesses in the country. The government has published incentive measures and hopes to receive suggestions based on the current situation. (3) Overseas sales markets: Overseas markets, especially those in Southeast Asia that were previously dominated by Japanese goods, should be replaced by Chinese goods. He hopes that everyone will carefully plan and strive to achieve this. (4) The issue of organizing overseas Chinese industrial and commercial groups: All endeavors rely on cooperation between the government and the people. He hopes that overseas Chinese industrial and commercial groups will unite and cooperate with domestic industrial and commercial groups to work together for national construction. (5) Other issues regarding overseas Chinese economy. He hopes that all representatives will speak freely.</p>
<p>Chen Shuren's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission then gave a speech, saying that the relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland has always been extremely close, and that they have made great contributions to the motherland's revolution and war of resistance. In the future, national construction work will rely heavily on them. He hoped that they would better understand the national situation, invest in domestic economic construction, improve production and sales systems, and expand overseas markets, and asked them to fully express their opinions on this. Representatives from various ministries and overseas Chinese leaders then spoke, with the main content summarized as follows: (1) Protection of overseas Chinese: The inability to fully protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in various places is the most serious economic problem. This is a prerequisite for enabling overseas Chinese to invest in the country. The government should pay special attention to this. (2) Overseas remittances: Many overseas governments restrict overseas remittances, and the restoration of overseas branches of domestic banks is slow, making it extremely inconvenient for overseas Chinese to remit money. He hopes that the government will find ways to improve this situation and facilitate the return of capital to the country. (3) Shipping: The domestic and foreign shipping industries are underdeveloped, resulting in outflow of freight costs and hindering cargo transport. He proposed a unified plan for investment in the development of inland and ocean shipping. (4) Recovery loans for overseas Chinese should be implemented quickly and be fair. (5) Improve the quality of domestic goods and promote them widely to capture overseas markets.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's Remarks</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, everyone had lunch together. During the meal, Chen Lifu arrived and gave an impromptu talk on "China's Current Economic Problems," stating that the domestic economic situation is serious, with two main problems: (1) Contraction of currency extends to production capital. Regarding the issuance of legal tender, due to fear of inflation, frantic contraction is taking place. This measure is not incorrect, but attention must be paid to not contracting the currency in the production sector. Otherwise, production will be limited, materials will decrease, prices will naturally rise, and it will not solve the problem. (2) Bank policies are not in line with the national situation. The current strange phenomenon in the financial world is that assets cannot be converted into liquid capital. Only raw materials can be mortgaged for loans. This is because the bank policies in our country acknowledge the policies of colonial banks under the great powers. Under this type of banking system, depositors seek high interest rates, private banks use speculative industries, and investors are afraid, leading to production stagnation. Therefore, the current serious economic situation is not the fault of any producer, nor can it be entirely attributed to the Communist Party's occupation. To find a solution, we must fundamentally reform the banking system and policies, and strictly distinguish between production capital and surplus currency. He has expressed these views to President Song and believes that if financial authorities can vigorously cure the economic root causes and eradicate the legacy of colonialists, they can solve the most serious problems.</p>
<p>After lunch, the meeting continued to discuss the five issues proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the proposal by Pan Xulun, all of which were approved in principle. Finally, Zhou Qigang made a summary, expressing his deep gratitude for the valuable opinions contributed by the overseas Chinese leaders. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will adopt them as much as possible and consult with relevant agencies to quickly alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Representatives Conference of the Industrial Association; Wu Yun-chu Reports on the Future Work Plan of the General Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Representatives Conference of the National Industrial Association of China opened at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Guests including Gu Zhenggang, Wang Yunwu (represented by Pan Xulun), Chen Lifu (represented by Peng Erkang), Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from various regions of the association, totaling approximately 90 people, attended. The venue was decorated simply, with three rows of long tables arranged lengthwise, covered with white tablecloths. The representatives sat in pairs in six rows. Chairman Wu Yun-chu presided over the meeting, leading the rituals, and then gave a speech, stating that China is a world power and that the state of China's industry is sufficient to affect the world economy and is closely related to world peace and human welfare. However, more than a year after the victory, the deterioration of the domestic situation has been unexpected. Transportation is blocked, raw materials are lacking, prices are rising, and people's livelihoods are withering. Not only can new construction not be discussed, but even the pre-war industries with a rudimentary scale cannot continue production. The domestic market is flooded with foreign goods, and the seriousness of the situation has reached its extreme. The convening of the Representatives Conference of the Industrial Association at this time is of great significance. He hopes that all colleagues will focus on two key points: (1) remedying the current industrial crisis and (2) studying the government's industrial laws and regulations, gather ideas, speak freely, and put forward concrete suggestions to the government. Then, he invited Gu Zhenggang to give instructions. He expressed his satisfaction with the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various regions in the meeting to discuss the future of the national industry. He also said that China must be industrialized before construction can be discussed, and the success of national economic construction is essential for establishing the country in the world today. The obstacles given to industry and commerce by the current domestic situation are temporary. Although all aspects of the country are suffering from the adverse effects of this situation, solutions will certainly be found in the resolution of the overall problem. Pan Xulun then gave a speech saying that government leaders and industrial leaders alike are anxious about China's economic problems and are painstakingly devising various possible solutions. He hoped that the conference could make concrete and feasible suggestions to the government and work hard to do what others cannot, helping the government to save the current crisis and improve the current state of industry. Peng Erkang then delivered a speech on behalf of Chen Lifu, offering encouragement to the representatives and wishing the conference great success. Finally, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech saying that industry and commerce are like the two eyes and two ears of the human body in the national economic enterprise. He hoped that people in the industry and commerce sectors would work closely together and strive for national construction. At 12:00 noon, the entire audience took a photo in front of the venue and then dispersed. The first general meeting was held at 3:00 PM, presided over by Wu Yun-chu, who reported on the future work plan of the general association. Representatives from various regions reported on the current industrial situation and branch affairs in their respective regions. Most industries in various regions are suffering and finding recovery difficult. The association's work has also lacked significant progress in the past year. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. A group review meeting will be held on the morning of the 10th, and the second general meeting will be held in the afternoon to discuss the proposals.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Traitor Zhou Zuoren Concluded; What He Claimed in Court Yesterday Was Nothing But Excuses; The Court Ordered Sentencing on the 16th After Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Zhou Zuoren, a traitor from "Kucha Zhai," was tried at the High Court on the 9th. At 10:30 AM, Zhou was escorted from the Tiger Bridge Detention Center to the High Court. At 10:45 AM, Presiding Judge Ge Zhitan, accompanied by Judges Ge Zhaotang and Yang Yutian, and Prosecutor Wang Wenzun, convened a collegiate panel in the Dacheng Hall. Five minutes later, Zhou stepped onto the defendant's stand, wearing a dark blue wool coat, a light blue homespun Chinese-style trousers, gray socks, black round-toed casual shoes, and glasses. His beard and hair were mottled, but his spirit was particularly good. The court first announced that the opening of the trial had been more than 15 days since the previous decision, so a new trial should be held, but because most of the evidence had already been investigated, the interrogation would be relatively simple. He then announced the results of the investigation of the documents not completed last time. Ying Qianli replied in a letter that he did not know that the defendant had tried to rescue him and had never communicated with him. Dong Xifan's notes were used as evidence, and the Shanghai District Court replied this year, but the previous letters with the defendant could be used as evidence. The court then questioned him on his allegiance to the enemy and his employment in puppet positions, as well as his发表谬论. Zhou replied that he stayed in Beiping after the July 7th Incident because his family had many people and could not leave. He said that his role in the puppet positions was to preserve the property of Peking University and was not due to being coerced after being assassinated. He said that when he was the chairman of the "East Asia Cultural Association," he had to say what he said because of his position, but he never said a word to slander the War of Resistance. During his tenure as a supervisor in the puppet Ministry of Education, he did not promote slave education. The preface to the book "The Dream of the Green Girl" written by Japanese women Meiniang and Kaneko was a general preface written for the series of creations by the Youth Library of the puppet Xinmin Bookstore, etc. All of his answers were excuses. At 11:10 AM, the debate began. After Prosecutor Wang Wenzun listed Zhou's crimes, Zhou refuted them one by one. At around 12:00 noon, his appointed lawyer, Wang Long, defended him on four points: (1) Staying in Beiping and taking up puppet positions after the July 7th Incident was entirely to complete the task of preserving the property of Peking University. Jiang Menglin and Hu Shi both had letters to prove this. (2) He had sheltered and rescued underground workers; (3) He was not the mastermind behind his allegiance to the enemy and was forced to do so; (4) He did not promote slave education. Chief Zhu had admitted this fact in a speech in Beiping. At 1:00 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 16th. Zhou was returned to detention.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Ceasefire Order Was Issued</h3>
<p>The people of the whole country were delighted to hear that Chairman Chiang had issued an order to cease military conflicts, all believing that the situation would from then on have hope of improvement; at the same time, they were particularly concerned about the Chinese Communists' reaction. Everyone ultimately believed that the Chinese Communists could not remain indifferent to the government's repeated concessions; however, a Chinese Communist spokesperson still stated: "The 'cessation of other military actions' unilaterally announced by the Kuomintang government was neither consulted with the Communist Party representatives beforehand, and the exclusion of what is 'necessary for defending the existing area' can still be used as an excuse for all military actions. All the proposed measures in the political arena are far from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures, therefore the future of the negotiations is truly not optimistic." This statement truly made the people of the whole country somewhat perplexed. The Chinese Communist Party's argument not only fails to be self-consistent, but also shows that the Chinese Communists have not been candid about peace talks and have not dispelled all suspicions, which is truly disappointing to us peace-loving people. However, the future development of the situation depends on the attitude of the Chinese Communists because the government has exhausted its ability to tolerate and concede, and has reached a point where it can no longer tolerate or concede. For the sake of the country and the nation, and also for the sake of the future of the Central and Northern regions, we still hope that the Chinese Communists will rein in at the edge of the cliff. Although the opportunity is urgent, there are still forty-eight hours. Within these forty-eight hours, we still look forward to Nanjing, waiting here at every moment for the good news of the Chinese Communists suddenly awakening.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese surrendered more than a year ago, our bandits and special agents were able to seize the opportunity to straighten up and start national construction, leading the country onto a bright and smooth path; instead, due to the issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we have failed to get through the period of recovery and embark on the stage of revitalization. Time flies, wasting time again and again, which is truly a pity. The people of the whole country certainly hope for the realization of domestic peace and unification, and the government is even more eagerly seeking peace and seeking unification, but more than a year of peace talks has been like a nightmare, and everyone hopes that the Chinese Communists will quickly wake up from this nightmare. The past situation of the peace talks, let's put it aside for now, and let's look back at the changes in the overall situation in the most recent month, which can truly be described as unexpected twists and turns.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communists issued a statement on September 30, demanding that the government cease all military actions against Zhangjiakou, otherwise they would consider the peace talks to have broken down and would no longer be willing to continue holding them. Although the Chinese Communists' memorandum had the nature of a final ultimatum, the government still expressed tolerance and proposed two suggestions for resolving the situation, advocating that the Three-Person Conference and the Five-Person Group should meet at the same time, so that the two important issues of reorganizing the national government and the ceasefire method could be resolved simultaneously. However, the Chinese Communists repeatedly delayed this and ignored it, and the Yan'an Broadcasting Station announced the demands of the Chinese Communists, that is, demanding that the National Army withdraw from the areas recovered after January 13 of this year, otherwise the Chinese Communists would not participate in the negotiations to reorganize the government and would fight to the end. The Chinese Communists' attitude not only caused anxiety to the peace-loving people of the whole country, but also made the Allied mediators General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart feel deeply uneasy. However, General Marshall, with his indomitable spirit, treated the "dead horse as if it were a live one" and suggested to both sides that there be a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou. The government first expressed its agreement, but the Chinese Communists consistently refused and attacked General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart for favoring the government, saying that they were using delaying tactics for the government. Therefore, the peace talks were approaching a cliff and it was almost impossible to break the deadlock. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang delivered a radio address on National Day, expressing the government's desire for a political solution and always hoping for candid consultations, so that the door to peace talks remained open. The next day, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, and at the same time, the government issued an order to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, which suddenly caused the situation to take a turn for the worse and enter a new stage. The so-called "representatives of the third party" and social elites, in view of the tension of the situation, also came out to work for peace and mediate the opinions of both sides, in order to reopen the peace talks. Chairman Chiang also issued a statement on October 16, proposing eight measures for handling the current situation, which were enlightened and fair, and were unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, so that the Chinese Communist representatives who stayed in Shanghai had no choice but to go to Nanjing on the morning of October 21 to resume peace talks, which once again ignited a ray of hope for the people of the country, believing that the situation would definitely improve from then on. However, the Chinese Communists insisted on two conditions, so that the peace talks still remained deadlocked in the dispute between the "eight points" and the "two conditions." The Chinese Communists never responded to the government's eight points, until the Chinese Communist reply was handed over to the government representatives by Zhou Enlai through General Marshall the night before last, but the content of which is still unknown.</p>
<p>From the past of these peace talks, the attitude of the Chinese Communists has always been uncertain, and the arguments on which they are based are inevitably contradictory. For example, the Chinese Communists have been demanding a ceasefire for a long time; now that the government has automatically and unconditionally issued a ceasefire order, it is only natural for the Chinese Communists to not only express their welcome, but also to follow the government's lead and issue a ceasefire order as well; but the Chinese Communists say that the government unilaterally announced the ceasefire order, not only expressing their unwillingness to issue a ceasefire order, but also opposing the government's issuance of a ceasefire order. This self-contradictory statement only makes the people of the country understand the intentions of the Chinese Communists. The so-called facts speak louder than words. The Chinese Communists are so unpredictable. In the future, no matter how clever the propaganda methods adopted by the Chinese Communists, it will be difficult to convince the people. There is no need to say more.</p>
<p>As for the so-called "third party," they have indeed spent a lot of effort for peace in the past month, which is worthy of our admiration, but considering the opinions expressed by some representatives of the Democratic League regarding the government's issuance of the ceasefire order, they are still singing the same tune as the Chinese Communists, which is truly a pity for us. If such enlightened representatives are also unable to distinguish right from wrong, how can they avoid being suspected of blindly following? We hope that all parties can put the country and the nation first, and continue to work hard to persuade the Chinese Communists to issue a ceasefire order and submit a list of representatives to the National Assembly, so that representatives from all parts of the country and representatives from all parties can gather together on the birthday of the Founding Father. From a long-term perspective, they can discuss the fundamental law of the country and lay a solid foundation for the country's long-term plan.</p>
<h3>Opening of the National Industrial Association</h3>
<p>The first National Congress of the China National Industrial Association after the victory was convened in the capital the day before yesterday; according to reported news, the task of this conference is to review the current industrial difficulties and plan future economic construction work. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Congress recently closed in the capital, and now the National Industrial Association Congress is closely following, which can truly show that the national industry and commerce are deeply aware of the necessity of unity in order to seek the improvement of industry and commerce, which is indeed a commendable thing.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese industry, its equipment is outdated and its technology is backward, which cannot be compared with industrialized countries; but even our nascent industry has made great contributions to the country and the nation during the Anti-Japanese War. The relocation of Chinese factories to the interior is an epic story in the history of our Anti-Japanese War. Under the difficult circumstances in the interior, the situation was extremely difficult, but our nascent national industry supported the country's eight-year long War of Resistance. All of this spirit is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Now, it has been more than a year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but the dangers faced by Chinese industry are even greater than during the war. The prevalence of usury, the massive import of cheap foreign goods, the difficulty in the supply of raw materials and electricity, the continuous increase in production costs, and the opposite continuous decline in production efficiency, as well as the failure to resume transportation smoothly, have all put Chinese industry in an extremely difficult situation. What was hoped for in the former Anti-Japanese War era has not only not been realized now, but its situation is even more difficult than during the war. This situation certainly cannot be allowed to continue; it is often heard that factories are closing down due to losses. How to promptly reverse this decline and revitalize the national industry is an urgent task for the government. From a passive point of view, the massive import of cheap foreign goods threatens the survival of our national industry. Although the government's collection of tariffs implies the intention of protecting our nascent national industry, its effect is not obvious. To this day, cheap foreign goods are everywhere on the market. At a time when the monetary system has not yet begun to be reorganized, how to effectively control imports is the key to saving our national industry. The popularity of usury makes it difficult for industrial funds to circulate. Therefore, from an active point of view, the government should fully provide Chinese industry with credit facilities, such as expanding the scope and quantity of industrial loans, so that China's nascent national industry will not be exhausted and decline. All of these are things that the government can do with its power, and the government should provide assistance.</p>
<p>As for the industrialization of China as a whole, not only should there be a meticulous plan, but it is also important to implement it in a timely manner. Currently, there is the so-called issue of state-owned versus private in the Chinese industrial community; in practice, this should not be considered an issue and be brought up for discussion. According to our highest guiding principle for nation-building, state-owned heavy industry and private light industry are established policies, with clear boundaries. There is no room for ambiguity. The main part of China's national industry is light industry, the daily necessities industry, that is, the industry that produces direct consumer goods, which belongs to the scope of private operation. The state originally had no intention of banning or prohibiting it. This is absolutely impossible for a country that prides itself on democratic progress. The Soviet Union's successive five-year plans centered on heavy industry, that is, the military industry; to this day, the people of the Soviet Union do not have enough products that can be directly consumed. Although the situation in our country is not exactly as we would like, our industrial community should have a necessary understanding, that is, only under the highest guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for nation-building, can the existing foundation of China's national industry have its future.</p>

<h3>Shortage of Raw Materials and Heavy Costs: Wuxi Silk Factories Shut Down One After Another, Proposing Requirements to Save the Crisis of Collapse</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi by Our Newspaper] Since the start of operations, silk factories in the city have been plagued by exceptionally heavy losses on autumn cocoons and slower production rates, leading to higher costs. Each dan of silk requires over 6 million yuan, while the government's limited price for purchasing raw silk is 3.8 million yuan, resulting in a loss of over 2 million yuan per dan. As a result, manufacturers are in a state of desperation and are on the verge of collapse. Recently, about 20-30% of the factories have successively shut down due to the lack of raw materials. The Sericulture Association of the Third District has discussed this serious issue and decided on the following points: (1) Given the excessive losses incurred by factories due to the high cost of autumn cocoons, the government is requested to purchase raw silk based on the cost of autumn cocoons. (2) Although 75,000 dan of Japanese cocoons have been allocated for transport to China, repeated negotiations with the government have yielded no progress. With factories facing a shortage of raw materials and shutting down one after another, the China Cocoon Corporation is requested to allocate dried cocoons to maintain the temporary situation. (3) The government is requested to send personnel to investigate the losses suffered by factories and rural areas during the period of Japanese occupation. (4) The cost of purchasing autumn cocoons for each factory has largely exceeded 60%, while the Autumn Cocoon Management Office still recognizes only 42%. An increase is requested. If no solution is found, most of the silk factories in Wuxi will shut down to avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<p>[Report from Wuxi by Our Newspaper] The local Cloth Industry Association has reported that cotton yarn used by dyeing and weaving factories is mostly obtained from the black market, resulting in extremely high prices and increased costs, which in turn have hindered sales and caused cloth prices to fall, leading to significant losses for each factory. The recent reorganization of the yarn distribution mechanism by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Shanghai Ministry of Economic Affairs, along with improvements to the joint yarn distribution system, is expected to reduce costs and increase production for each factory. However, this yarn distribution system is only implemented by the China Textile Construction Company and local private yarn factories, and other private yarn factories in various regions have not joined. On the 7th, the association sent a special telegram to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Shanghai Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting it to instruct the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District and the Jiangsu-Anhui Yarn Factory Federation to allocate cotton yarn to cloth factories in various regions according to the joint yarn distribution system in order to provide relief and maintain production.</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief in Northeastern Anhui</h3>
<p>Focusing Primarily on Shelters</p>
<p>[Report from Bengbu by Our Newspaper] The disaster situation in the counties of northeastern Anhui, affected by military disasters and floods, is extremely severe, and has become even more serious after the start of winter. The Anhui Relief Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration convened a relief conference for northeastern Anhui in Bengbu on the 6th. Representatives from 24 cities and counties, including Fengyang and Huaiyuan, attended.

It was decided that the Branch would allocate from the requested materials to the counties. (3) Requesting the Relief Branch to establish standards for disaster relief. The method is to focus primarily on providing relief materials to shelters, to accommodate as many widowed, orphaned, lonely, and elderly people as possible, as well as infants and pregnant women, in order to reduce social unrest. The resolution was passed.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Siming Mountains Extensively Kidnapping</h3>
<p>[Report from Yuyao] After several campaigns to suppress the bandits in the Siming Mountains, the bandit forces remain rampant. According to people from Liangnong, the bandits in the Siming Mountains sometimes hide in the bushes and rob merchants. Recently, the bandits have mostly engaged in kidnapping, with groups of five or six people sneaking into villages and abducting residents into the mountains. The next day, they send letters to the families of the hostages, demanding a certain amount of national currency to be paid at a certain location for their release, otherwise they will tear up the ticket or set fire to the village, which is inhumane.</p>

The entire project is expected to be completed in three or four months.</p>
<p>[Report from Hefei by Our Newspaper] This summer, many bridges along the Hefei-Anqing Highway were washed away by mountain floods, especially the major bridges in the Tongcheng-Anqing section. Therefore, for several months, the vehicles of the Highway Bureau only traveled the section from Hefei to Tongcheng. Because the bridges in the Tongcheng-Anqing section have now been repaired, the entire Hefei-Anqing line will begin selling tickets on November 10. Only tickets to Tongcheng and Shucheng are sold along the way, and small stations are not served.</p>

<p>[Report from Suzhou by Our Newspaper] The price limit for flour in this county has always been ordered to be determined by Mr. Wang Maogong, the Chairman of the Provincial Government , but flour manufacturers can only comply for a while, and soon it is nominal and the black market is rampant, which has caused strong resentment from all walks of life. Subsequently, the Taihe, Yuanhe, and Xinfeng flour mills filed a petition with the provincial government requesting permission to sell 20% of each factory's daily output at the limited price, and the rest at cost, because they claimed to be suffering heavy losses. The provincial government approved the request, as the request was deemed to be true.

In addition, regarding the price issue, the provincial order also stipulated that the minimum price must be 5% to 15% lower than the price of rice in Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Report from Suzhou by Our Newspaper on the 9th] Our newspaper reporter visited the clearing command of Taihu and Yangcheng Lakes on the 9th to inquire about the progress of the clearing work. It was reported that the initial clearing and pacification work in the Taihu and Yangcheng areas was completed at the end of October. However, in order to thoroughly eliminate the scattered bandits, a second-phase clearing plan was formulated and is scheduled to be completed by the end of November. The characteristics of this plan are to use the police teams of the counties under its jurisdiction as the foundation, divide the areas into units of townships and villages, and simultaneously launch searches to clear out the hidden bandits, in order to thoroughly eliminate them. Compared with the past method of mobilizing by integrating small units into larger ones, this is a further step forward. Secondly, after the search and clearing work is perfected, preparations will be made to handle the joint guarantee and joint responsibility system for townships and villages, so as to make it a permanent solution. Now, the detailed rules of this clearing plan have been distributed to the counties of Su, Xi, Wu, , , and Tai for strict compliance.</p>

The news that this year's field tax would be collected at a 50% discounted rate has already been widely known. If it is changed, the people will inevitably misunderstand, and this year there have been two major floods and wind and rain disasters, and the people are extremely poor. Therefore,顾省议员，凌县议长，长等 people were dispatched on the 6th to the 省 to petition to continue collecting the tax at the original discounted rate in order to alleviate the hardship of the people.</p>

<h3>Universal Establishment of Cooperatives in Reclaimed Counties of Northern Jiangsu; Illegitimate Ones to be Dissolved and Reorganized</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang] Since the restoration, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has successively ordered all counties and cities to establish cooperative organizations to promote various cooperative undertakings. Now that the counties in northern Jiangsu have been gradually recovered, in order to stabilize order and restore local vitality as soon as possible, the Provincial Department of Social Affairs has formulated a "Set of Emergency Implementation Points for the Restoration of Cooperative Undertakings in the Pacification Zone of this Province," which has been passed and implemented by the Provincial Government's 66th regular meeting. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Cooperative organizations at all levels in the pacification zone counties must closely cooperate with the consolidation and demarcation of land, complete the work within a time limit, and ensure that all people join the cooperative. Each urban area should have an urban area cooperative, and each township should have a township cooperative. Urban area cooperatives or township cooperatives may set up branches within their business areas depending on their business conditions. (2) Counties in the pacification zone should accelerate the organization of county federations of cooperatives. For urgent business needs, they may start business operations in the name of a preparatory office. (3) Existing illegal cooperatives in the pacification zone will be dissolved and liquidated, and reorganized as county federations of cooperatives or urban and rural cooperatives depending on the situation. (4) Urban area cooperatives in the pacification zone should mainly engage in consumer business, supplying various daily necessities such as food, fuel, oil, salt, cloth, etc., and also handle cooperative factories and public housing cooperative businesses. Township cooperatives in the pacification zone should mainly engage in production, transportation, sales, and agricultural warehousing, and also handle consumer business. (5) County cooperative federations should be responsible for coordinating the cooperative business of urban and rural areas, and for the exchange of materials between them, and should assist lower-level cooperatives in developing various businesses. (6) Cooperative organizations at all levels in the pacification zone should cooperate with the government's economic policies to handle the transportation and sales of local specialties to prevent unscrupulous merchants from aiding the bandits, and should also find ways to fully supply military and civilian goods. (7) The prices of goods sold by cooperatives in the pacification zone should be lower than market prices in principle, and a voucher-based purchase system should be implemented to prevent malpractices.</p>

<p>Xiangde Road Needs Light</p>
<p>I live on Xiangde Road at the end of Shigaota Road. There used to be dozens of streetlights there, but they fell into disrepair after eight years of war. After peace, my neighbors and I applied to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to install new bulbs. The company said that we needed to apply to the Public Utilities Bureau, but not long after, the streetlights there were all removed. Given the prosperity of this road and the large number of residents, especially the unevenness of the road surface, more streetlights should be added, but why is it now in complete darkness? I dare to ask for instructions so that we can see the light again. This is what the residents of Xiangde Road have been hoping for day and night. (Ouyang Wen)</p>
<p>Is an Order Needed to Return Prepaid Fees?</p>
<p>I am one of the low-income civil servants in this city. My young child is studying in a private middle school in this city. At the beginning of this semester, I paid the reserved fee as usual. When classes started, I presented the payment receipt from the bank designated by the school to obtain the class attendance certificate. Who knows that the tuition I paid was borrowed at high interest? When I paid the fee, I thought that the City Education Bureau had a meeting to exempt the tuition fees for the children of civil servants. I only needed the school to issue a notice or certificate, and the original tuition fee could be refunded. I would only lose a little interest. Who knew that in October, the civil servant fee exemption certificate for children of civil servants from the City Education Bureau was forwarded through my work unit. After verifying with the school, I requested a refund, but the school said that it had not received an order from the Education Bureau and ignored the matter. I think that as long as the certificate is not forged or altered, all public and private schools in this city have the obligation to comply with it and do not need a separate notification. However, my pleading was of no avail. I think there must be many other civil servants in the same situation as me. I would be very grateful if the education authorities could give clear instructions.

<h3>No Results from Consecutive Meetings of Four Foreign Ministers; Trieste Issue Negotiated Outside of Meeting; Yugoslavia Expresses Willingness to Improve Relations with Western Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] Western power diplomats here said today that if Italy and Yugoslavia can find a new way to resolve the issue of the Port of Trieste, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference can immediately abandon its plan for international co-management of the port. The Four Foreign Ministers met for four hours and forty minutes today and decided to set aside the Trieste issue and proceed to discuss the treaties with Italy and Romania. There was no result from the discussion on the Danube navigation clause in the Romanian treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed including this clause in the treaty but expressed willingness to discuss it separately. British Foreign Minister Bevin said that the free navigation of the Danube, whether guaranteed by a treaty or any other means, is irrelevant. However, Britain, which has fought for the longest time, does not want to sacrifice all its rights in the war. US Secretary of State Byrnes supported Bevin's opinion. There will be no formal meetings on the weekend of the 9th and 10th to allow representatives to negotiate informally. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Byrnes is preparing to watch a large-scale football game.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 8th] The Four Great Powers Foreign Ministers decided tonight in an emergency motion to postpone the discussion of the Trieste issue indefinitely. It is widely believed that informal, non-public negotiations may be conducted outside the conference on this serious issue. The above suggestion was made by Byrnes at the fourth Foreign Ministers meeting today. Prior to making this motion, Byrnes met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic and Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Kosanovic. It was also only one day after Yugoslav Marshal Tito announced that he would exchange the Port of Trieste for Gorizia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic expressed to British Foreign Minister Bevin here today that Yugoslavia is willing to improve relations with Western countries and satisfactorily resolve the issue of the Port of Trieste and the southern Italian border to eliminate the causes of permanent friction. Authoritative sources said that Simic did not present Yugoslavia's recent new proposal to exchange Gorizia for the Port of Trieste. He also did not mention this proposal when he met with US Secretary of State Byrnes yesterday, which proves that the Yugoslav delegation in New York has not been instructed to present this matter to the Foreign Ministers Conference. It is also learned that M. Mauvais, representing French Foreign Minister Bidault, also met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic and Italian Ambassador to the United States Gallarati this morning, and it is thought that Simic did not formally present Marshal Tito's recent new proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] In view of the recent developments in various aspects, diplomats here are speculating that the Trieste issue, which has been in a stalemate for a long time, may be resolved. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic, accompanied by the Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, visited US Secretary of State Byrnes for consultations. The content is unknown, but diplomatic circles believe that it may be discussing the Trieste issue. According to those familiar with the situation of the Foreign Ministers Conference here, the statement made by the Yugoslav representative at the Foreign Ministers Conference on Wednesday regarding the Trieste issue was more moderate in tone, and public opinion still attaches great importance to it. Its tone is completely different from the situation when the Yugoslav delegation withdrew from the peace conference in Paris due to the Trieste issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 8th] The Belgian News Agency announced that the Grand Duke of Luxembourg has requested the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to approve Luxembourg's eastern border with Germany. It is reported that Luxembourg has requested to modify the border between the areas of Moehnthal and Somme.</p>
<h3>Tito's New Proposal: Unwilling to Allow the Port of Trieste to be Controlled by Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Trieste, 8th] A communist newspaper in Trieste published a statement by Babic, Secretary-General of the "Italian-Slovene Anti-Fascist Alliance of Trieste," accusing Britain and the United States of planning to use the Port of Trieste as a base for imperialist aggression to resist the development of democratic forces in Italy and Yugoslavia and all democratic forces in Eastern Europe. Tito's new proposal, which allows Italy to retain the Port of Trieste and allows Yugoslavia to obtain Gorizia, can prevent imperialists from taking advantage of the conflict between southern Italy and Yugoslavia and reaping the benefits. According to this first comment from Yugoslav figures on Tito's new proposal, the Tito government would rather allow defeated Italy to retain the Port of Trieste than allow the United Nations to control the area. Pro-Tito figures here also informally claimed that they believe that Tito's proposal that Italy retain the Port of Trieste is conditional on the Port of Trieste being a demilitarized zone and that a democratic government be established in the area in accordance with the ten-point proposal previously made by the "Italian-Slovene Anti-Fascist Alliance." In addition, Yugoslavia may also request the coastal area west of the Port of Trieste to Monfalcone to be ceded to Yugoslavia. If this happens, the Port of Trieste will become an Italian island within Yugoslav territory. The Italian National Liberation Committee of Venezia Giulia has now issued a public statement in response to the Roman government's rejection of Tito's new proposal.</p>
<h3>Proper Distribution of UN Relief Supplies Demanded by China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The United Nations Economic and Financial Committee began discussing the world food situation today. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun spoke at the meeting, demanding that relief supplies be properly distributed without considering transportation and political issues. Zhang Pengchun described the current agricultural situation in China, which has been affected by the war, especially the situation of rice production. Since China is a rice-producing country, in terms of global relief efforts, "rice-producing countries are not as valued as wheat-producing countries." Zhang said that China has suffered greatly because other countries have more convenient transportation. Therefore, Zhang declared that China will propose suggestions emphasizing the need to quickly distribute existing relief supplies.</p>
<h3>South Africa's Annexation of Southwest Africa Opposed by Two South American Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council recently held a meeting where representatives from Haiti and Guatemala expressed their opposition to the South African Union's annexation of Southwest Africa. The Czech representative also said that it would be unwise to try to resolve this issue hastily.</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Intend to Take Strong Action Against the Franco Regime; The Byelorussian Proposal Will Be Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report] San Francisco, 9th Radio: The United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the Byelorussian proposal. The Byelorussian representative requested the United Nations to impose economic sanctions on the Franco regime. It is under discussion, but the US side has informally stated in advance that it will not endorse any coercive action. It is expected that the Byelorussian proposal will be rejected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] It is reported that the United States is not yet prepared to take strong action against Franco's Spain, such as the economic sanctions proposed by Byelorussia. The US delegation attending the United Nations conference discussed this entire issue today and believes that now is not the time to take decisive action. However, the discussion did not result in a definite resolution. The matter will continue to be discussed next week.</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Continue to Fully Support UN Agencies</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 8th] US Senator Vandenberg's landslide victory in this election has placed him at the forefront of Republican presidential candidates. Vandenberg said today at the United Nations Budget Committee that regardless of whether the future US president belongs to the Republican or Democratic Party, the United States will fully support the United Nations. He said: "Regardless of the political system in Washington, the United States will continue to fully support the United Nations. The United States government is determined to cooperate sincerely with all countries to strive for a system of mutual prevention of aggression through the United Nations agencies, to achieve peace and justice, and to promote the welfare of the world."</p>
<h3>Applications for New Members Should Be Reviewed</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Speaks at the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] Gu Weijun, chief representative of China, said yesterday afternoon at the Political and Security Committee meeting that the Chinese government believes that the General Assembly should request the Security Council to review the membership applications of five countries. The applications of these five countries were previously rejected by the Security Council. Among them, the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan were rejected by the Soviet Union using its veto power. The applications of Albania and Outer Mongolia were rejected by Britain and the United States. Gu said that China, in its capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, supports the view that the General Assembly should not take action on the issue of new member states without a recommendation from the Security Council. However, there are different interpretations of the United Nations Charter on this point. The Chinese delegation believes that the Security Council should take a more liberal view of this article in the Charter. China supports allowing all five countries to be listed as candidate member states in order to accelerate the admission of qualified countries. To say that an applicant country should be refused candidate status because it does not maintain relations with several countries is beyond the provisions of the Charter. In short, the Security Council needs to review the rejected applications of the five countries.</p>
<p>Britain Has Not Established Diplomatic Relations with Outer Mongolia</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said today in response to a reporter's question on whether the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia would be allowed to join the United Nations that the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia has never attempted to establish diplomatic relations with Britain, and conversely, Britain has never attempted to establish diplomatic relations with Outer Mongolia. Britain has always believed that it cannot support the application of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with Britain to join United Nations agencies.</p>
<p>Rejecting the Membership of Portugal and Ireland</p>
<p>The Soviet Union States Its Reasons</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko proposed a new standard for the qualifications of those applying to join the United Nations today at the Political and Security Committee. He argued that the committee should consider the applicant country's behavior and attitude during World War II. Gromyko gave a lengthy speech explaining the Soviet Union's views. In response to the attacks by various small countries in recent days, he defended the Soviet Union's rejection of the applications of Ireland, Jordan, and Portugal, and explained the reasons why the applications of Albania and Outer Mongolia should be approved.</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Withdraw Its Political Representative to Albania</h3>
<p>Unable to Find a Way to Obtain Recognition from Albania</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, Associated Press] The US State Department announced that the US government has been unable to find a way to recognize Albania and will withdraw its political representation to that country. It is said that the Hoxha government refused to recognize the treaties between the US government and the former Albanian King Zog I, and the US government believes that the representation to Albania no longer serves a purpose.</p>
<h3>Jewish Resistance Movement Begins Counter-Terrorism Operations</h3>
<p>Jews Call on Bidault in a Letter</p>
<p>[Report] London, 9th Radio: Riots broke out in Jerusalem. First, the British military police received a tip that Jews were plotting something in a certain house. The British military police rushed to the scene, but upon entering the house, they triggered a landmine, killing three people. The British authorities are extremely angry about this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] The secret radio station of the Jewish resistance movement, "Voice of Israel," broadcast tonight that the Haganah army of the resistance movement has begun a "counter-terrorism operation" against the Irgun and Stern Gang terrorist groups and is confident of success. The nature of the counter-terrorism operation was not disclosed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] Authoritative sources said that French Foreign Minister Bidault recently received a letter signed by the Jewish Liberation Association, requesting Bidault to propose that the Palestinian issue be included on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h3>General Elections Held Throughout France Today</h3>

<h3>US Naval Authorities Study Pacific Defense Plan; Britain, the US, and Canada Discuss Joint Arctic Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 8th] US Pacific Fleet Commander Towers said here today that the US Naval High Command is studying the entire Pacific defense plan, including the fortification of Guam, in order to revise the plan and engage in post-war construction in a realistic and economic way. Towers believes that the US Navy and the federal government will face inevitable budget reduction plans during this period. However, building Guam into a strong base, according to the plan he supports, does not cost much. Some parties propose to spend up to one billion US dollars on a five-year plan to make Guam a second Pearl Harbor. Naval authorities in Washington are currently studying a plan that would allow Guam to be built to meet limited peacetime needs, but the basic engineering work would allow for rapid expansion of its naval facilities in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Related parties believe that the reason for the visit to the United States by Major General Laycock, Commander of the British Joint Operations Forces, is to inform the US side of the British view on the US requisitioning of Canadian bases. Marshal Brooke and Marshal Montgomery are understood to have held preliminary talks with US and Canadian military leaders on this matter during their recent visits to North America. The United States originally intended to defend the Arctic with Canada at the same time. The United States hopes that Canada will establish a chain of air force bases to strengthen its northern defense. Britain believes that Canada cannot complete this task without substantial financial assistance from the United States. One of the reasons for the current informal negotiations is to raise funds and use labor and raw materials. People here say that the discussion of this proposal is the first job after Alexander was appointed Minister of Defense.</p>
<h3>The United States Controls the Trusteeship Islands of Japan</h3>
<p>Australia Must Retain Control over New Guinea Bases</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, 8th, Associated Press] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, when reporting on Australia's foreign policy to Parliament, fully supported President Truman's plan to have the United States control the former Japanese trusteeship islands and other conquered enemy strongholds in the Pacific as part of the United States' defense plan under the United Nations trusteeship system. Australia is also very willing to allow the United States to retain naval and air bases on Manus Island, but the only condition is that Australia must retain full control over New Guinea. Australia welcomes the United States' trusteeship of the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands, and the fortification of these islands for the general security of the Pacific. We are very willing to enter into an agreement with the United States to mutually use Manus Island, that is, Australia retains control, but allows the United States to use its bases, and Australia can also use its bases in other areas controlled by the United States.</p>
<h3>US Government Convenes Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Saul Appointed Assistant Secretary of State</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The Truman Cabinet held its first meeting after the general election today to discuss plans to abolish the entire control system.

<h3>Japan Reparations Issue May Fall into Stalemate; Possible Submission for Discussion by Four Foreign Ministers; Supervisory Committee on Japan to Confer on US and Soviet Proposals</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Regarding the distribution of Japanese assets as compensation for Allied reparations, it is rumored that the US State Department has invited member states of the Far Eastern Commission to negotiate this issue with the US government. The State Department's proposal argues that the Far Eastern Commission should continue its work even if the Soviet Union refuses to participate. Although the Soviet Union has not yet submitted its reparations demands in detail, the US State Department has a complete list of all Japanese materials that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China and Korea as "war booty." This list was obtained by Truman's reparations commissioner, Pauley, during his investigation in Northeast China and Korea several months ago. Therefore, the US government proposes that if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the reparations committee, the reparations committee should determine the amount of reparations due to the Soviet Union, deduct the materials it removed from Northeast China and Korea, and then invite the Soviet Union to claim the remaining balance by a set date, otherwise, it will not be able to make any further demands. Once the Far Eastern Commission falls into a stalemate, it may be submitted for discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. China will also send a representative to attend, as the Far Eastern Commission was established in accordance with the agreement passed at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference last December.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 9th] The Allied Control Council for Japan will meet on the 13th to review the following issues: (1) Members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives who violate the purge order against militarists (Soviet proposal); (2) The scope of issues that the Control Council for Japan can review (US proposal).

<h3>Bernays Requests Ban on Promotion of Atomic Bomb Warfare; State Department Approves US Warship Visits to Turkish and Greek Ports</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 9th Radio: US Secretary of State Bernays will request President Truman to prohibit US Army and Navy leaders from promoting atomic bomb warfare, as such promotion makes peace talks difficult. Recently, the commanders-in-chief of the US Army and Navy have promoted that the B-36 aircraft can carry atomic bombs to any corner of the world. Due to opposition from the State Department, the US B-29's plan to travel around the world has been temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] The State Department has approved three US warships to visit ports in Greece and Turkey, which is tantamount to having US warships sail behind the Soviet Union's back door. Knowledgeable sources have thus become newly interested in speculating about the possibility of the US Superfortress aircraft groups flying around the world. This flight plan was canceled at the request of the State Department, but knowledgeable sources believe that the War Department has not abandoned the ideal of a world cruise. Army aviator Colonel Eielson, famous for flying over the Arctic, recently told reporters that he was prepared to lead Superfortress aircraft to fly over Moscow at the request of the State Department, "to support our country's diplomatic policy." However, Air Force Chief of Staff Spaatz replied to questions about this statement, saying that Eielson was a junior officer and his statement was not of an official nature.</p>

<h3>New Shanghai County Magistrate to Take Office Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Former Shanghai County Magistrate Xu Jinyu has been transferred to Songjiang, and the new Shanghai County Magistrate Ni Younian is scheduled to take office tomorrow. According to the Shanghai County, before the establishment of the Special Knock City, there were originally nineteen districts and townships. When the urban area was divided, the essence was all returned to the urban area, and the county government only had three districts west of the Huangpu River and two districts east of the Huangpu River. During the period of the Japanese occupation, the puppet government once abolished the county and renamed it Beiqiao District, which belonged to Shanghai City. Later, due to the division of provinces and cities, it was renamed Shenjiang County. After the victory, the original name was restored, and it still governs five districts. On the west side of the Huangpu River, the first district is Minhang Heqi, the second district is Tangwan Caohang, and the third district is Zhuanqiao Beiqiao Maqiao. On the east side of the Huangpu River, the first district is Sanlin and the second district is Chenxing. According to recent statistics, the total number of residents in the county is 118,663, with 250,000 mu of farmland, and cotton is the main agricultural product, followed by rice. There is a saying among the villagers: "Seven cottons and three rice." The county government was located on Penglai Road in the Nanshi area before 1929, and then moved to Beiqiao. Due to the damage to the houses during the war, it has now moved to the former district office in Minhang Town North.</p>

<h3>Enduring Dedication to China: Mr. Hollington Tong, Who Feared No Tyranny and Strove for Truth, Lived as a Friend of China and Wished to Rest in This Land After Death</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] "I want to go back to China! I want to die in China!" Mr. Hollington Tong, a devoted friend of China and a prominent foreign resident, upon learning of his "incurable" fate from doctors in Tahiti, in the Pacific, this spring, unhesitatingly made his final decision.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Tong has achieved his wish. He will rest peacefully in the soil of China, with the dewdrops of Chinese grass adorning his resting place.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong, at the age of seventy-one, dedicated his life to two words: "Truth." After arriving in Shanghai via Honolulu on March 18th of this year, Mr. Tong resided in a quiet ward on the third floor of the Country Hospital. The sunlight of early spring peeked through the cracks in the window, illuminating his bedside. Mr. Tong, his eyes fixed on those rays of light, told reporters: "People must not only know 'Truth,' but also seek 'Truth,' and even strive for 'Truth.'"</p>
<p>For forty-four years, Mr. Tong struggled, worked hard, and suffered for China and for humanity, all to achieve the purpose of his life.</p>
<p>Youth</p>
<p>Hollington Tong was born on June 20, 1875, in a large family in a small city in New South Wales, Australia. His father, a railroad contractor, hoped that his son would also become a railroad engineer. However, Tong was determined to pursue a career in journalism. Perhaps it was fate, or perhaps it was misfortune, but Tong injured his arm while playing with friends as a child, and from then on, he could no longer work with iron or repair machines. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, he entered a printing shop as a typesetter. Soon after, he became a reporter for a newspaper.</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Shanghai after the Russo-Japanese War, Appointed as English Secretary by Dr. Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>In 1902, the "China Mail," an English newspaper in Hong Kong, was looking to expand significantly, but the editor-in-chief was constantly worried and anxious because he couldn't find good reporters. None of the reporters he hired could resist the temptation of alcohol. With no other choice, the editor-in-chief could only send someone to Australia to scout for talent. The person chosen was Hollington Tong. Thus, he came to China and brought great achievements to the country.</p>
<p>Tong did not disappoint the editor-in-chief of the "China Mail," nor did he disappoint himself. He embarked on the road to success. The "China Mail" prospered day by day, becoming the largest newspaper in Hong Kong. In 1905, at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Tong served as a war correspondent for the New York Tribune. After the war ended, he joined the Shanghai English-language Far Eastern Review, writing articles. At that time, Rodney Gilbert, the chief writer of the Far Eastern Review, was a close friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. By chance, Gilbert introduced Tong to Dr. Sun. Dr. Sun was delighted to have such a friend who was greatly interested in Chinese politics and had exceptionally sincere revolutionary ideas, so he hired him as his English secretary. Tong not only helped Dr. Sun and China, but also helped the world. With revolutionary spirit, he traveled to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and overseas, promoting the revolutionary movement and enabling foreigners and Chinese people to gain a correct and new understanding of the current situation.</p>
<p>Forty Years of Foreign Residence on the Chinese Political Stage</p>
<p>From then on, Tong began his life as a foreign resident. In the forty years of his involvement in the Chinese political arena, every scene of change bore his contribution and his achievements. Several major events in Chinese history, such as the campaign against Yuan Shikai, China's participation in World War I, his persuasion of Zhang Zuolin to join the Northern Expedition, and even the Xi'an Incident, saw his direct or indirect involvement. His greatest effort was to publish the Twenty-One Demands proposed by Japan to the world through news reports, exposing the Japanese invaders' ambition to annex China to all countries.</p>
<p>In 1928, Tong met Zhang Xueliang through an introduction and was appointed as his advisor. The Young Marshal Zhang valued this wise mentor greatly, and from him, he gained a deeper political understanding and national consciousness. During this period, he persuaded Zhang and his father, indirectly assisting in the success of the Northern Expedition. In 1930, after the Northeast Flag Replacement, Tong accompanied Zhang Xueliang on a trip to Europe. Due to the influence of his sincere personality, the once pleasure-seeking Young Marshal broke away from his dark past.</p>
<p>Something the Chinese People Should All Be Grateful For</p>
<p>When Tong was with Dr. Sun, he had the opportunity to become acquainted with the Song sisters. "Uncle Tong" was always a respected and approachable figure in the Song sisters' impressions. In 1934, Tong returned to China from Europe and was introduced to Chiang Kai-shek by Madame Chiang. Chiang's wise and insightful governance deeply moved Tong, enabling him to express his opinions frankly and boldly, and to introduce the political thoughts of various European and American countries to Chiang. When the Xi'an Incident occurred, Tong volunteered and insisted on going north to serve Chiang. On December 25th of that year, Chiang safely escaped danger, becoming a major turning point in modern Chinese political history. This was naturally due to Chiang's virtue and prestige, but Tong's fearless contribution is also something that every Chinese person should be grateful for.</p>
<p>As time passed, Tong felt that his twilight years were approaching, and he needed to rest. In 1939, he went to Hong Kong and built a boat to begin his travels. Among the islands in the Pacific Ocean, with the vast sky and sea, Tong enjoyed a leisurely retirement in his secluded paradise. However, he remembered an unfinished task: to write a detailed memoir. But after returning to Tahiti, he was unable to write. Because he knew that in this politically turbulent era, his historical and political accounts, if not carefully written, could affect the overall situation. Therefore, he dared not write lightly.</p>
<p>Unrecognized in the Concentration Camp</p>
<p>In the years of Tong's retirement, Chiang and his wife constantly remembered him, hoping that he would return. Tong also couldn't forget China, so in the winter of 1941, he decided to return west. Unfortunately, when he arrived in Manila, the Pearl Harbor Incident occurred, and Tong became a prisoner in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. In the concentration camp, the enemy only knew that there was an elderly retired businessman named Tong, and did not know his true identity. After several tense and dangerous situations, Tong luckily remained unrecognized. Chiang and his wife, far away in Chongqing, knew about this and were anxious day and night. As soon as the Philippines was liberated, they immediately consulted with the US military authorities and sent paratroopers to rescue him. When he returned to his old residence in Tahiti for the third time, Mr. Tong's physical strength was exhausted, and he weighed forty pounds less than before. Chiang asked the US Navy to send a special plane to take him to the United States for examination, where he was found to have a terrible disease: cancer. However, Mr. Tong was not afraid. He regarded death as a return and only asked to return to his second hometown: China. When he first arrived in Shanghai, doctors said that he could only live for two more months, but after careful treatment, Tong was fortunate enough to bring us six more months of warmth. Even in his illness, he still roused his spirits, reading books and newspapers every day, and chatting with a few close friends about world affairs.</p>
<p>A Medal Given to Him by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Considered the Most Cherished Treasure of His Life</p>
<p>During his illness, he constantly thought about Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang. Two days before his death, although he could no longer speak, he did not want to die before seeing Madame Chiang. Chiang Kai-shek made a special trip from Taiwan to visit him. Madame Chiang met with him for the last time before his death. Tong nodded and smiled at her. He was satisfied. He will forever smile in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Tong had no estate and no belongings. He left his family early and separated from his wife. He had only one daughter, who is now in Australia. The most precious treasure of his life was the medal given to him by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Tong was a representative of "Truth." He was unwilling to compromise with the environment, and he was not afraid of the threat of evil forces. At the same time, he was also a firm and resolute person. The fact that he lived in China for more than forty years without ever eating Chinese food shows his upright and strong will.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, devoted friend of China! Today, those who come to the Universal Funeral Parlor to pay their respects to Mr. Tong will deeply remember his motto: "People must not only know 'Truth,' but also seek 'Truth,' and even strive for 'Truth.'"</p>

<h3>Zhu Bin of Li New Handkerchief Factory, Guilty of Continuously Inciting Strikes</h3>
<p>Zhu Bin Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhu Bin, a worker at the Li New Handkerchief Factory, is a representative of the handkerchief industry union in this city. In March of this year, because his request to the company for increased wages and improved treatment was not granted, he incited workers to strike for thirty-six days. Later, after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, an agreement was signed, but the company could not accept the item of paying wages on Sundays. Therefore, Zhu Bin gathered the workers and added incitement, attempting to strike again. The police department arrested Zhu and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor believed that Zhu Bin had violated Article 30 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce in Times of Emergency, so he filed a public prosecution according to law. The case was concluded yesterday in the sixth criminal court of the District Court. Judge Zhong announced in court: "Zhu Bin is sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for continuously inciting strikes and slowdowns."</p>

<h3>Using Career as Bait, Defrauding Large Sums of Money, Unemployed Friends Are Fooled, Asking for Money at Home and Falsely Accusing Them of Being Hoodlums, Harming Others and Harming Themselves, Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Le Jiafa, a 25-year-old from Ningbo, whose uncle Zhang Rujin is a park police officer in Fuxing Park, often went to the park for sightseeing, and thus met fifteen tourists including Mei LiangKang and Mei A Liang. They were on the same wavelength, and got on like a house on fire at first sight. Le Jiafa falsely claimed that he had been admitted to the Jianghai Customs and would be the captain of the anti-smuggling brigade in the future, and a group of unemployed friends were overjoyed when they heard the news, and asked him for help to find a job. At this point, Le Jiafa used his silver tongue, saying that the captain could employ thirty or forty team members, and the salary of each team member was generous, but currently, he needed to entertain important officials of the Jianghai Customs, such as Bai Linan and George, and the entertainment expenses were huge. He asked them to raise money for assistance. At that time, Mei LiangKang and others did not suspect fraud. They were full of hope of finding a job, so they pooled money together. From the end of September to the end of last month, they were defrauded of more than eight hundred yuan. However, because the time had passed for a long time, there was no action, so they became suspicious and inquired one after another. Who knew that Le only made appointments and delayed the time? Until the afternoon of the fourth of this month, Le had them meet at Fuxing Park again, and he still adopted a perfunctory attitude. So Mei and others asked for the paid money, and Le saw that the situation was not good, and agreed to return the advance at his home at 8:00 pm the night before. Who knew that Le would report to the Xincheng Police Station, falsely accusing a large number of hoodlums of trying to extort money, etc. The police station immediately ordered Song Bingzheng, the chief of the criminal section, to lead the police officers to rush to the scene, and arrested fifteen people including Mei LiangKang, Mei Ayou, Lu Guosheng, Yang Lianheng, E Gaobao, Fan Chengfu, Mei Wenbiao, Xia Zhenya, Ni Zhenyu, and Mei Yongxing. However, after interrogation, they found out the inside story. At this point, a group of unemployed people were greatly outraged. The police station turned around and arrested Le and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for fraud.</p>

<h3>Appraisal Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Five Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Labor Appraisal Committee held its fifth meeting in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those present were Wu Kaixian, Tan Yulin, Shen Baoyu, Xu Jichan, Zhang Wei, Zhao Zengjue (representing Li Kaidi), Zhu Xuefan (representing Shui Xiangyun), Liu Jingji and other more than ten people. The following cases were discussed: 1. Regarding the issue of the shoe industry company's request to reduce wages, because it is too related, it is planned to expand the investigation before making a concrete decision. The three methods originally scheduled for discussion are: one is that wages are not reduced, the second is that they are partially reduced, and the third is that they are generally reduced. 2. Regarding the clothing issue of the gas company's workers, it was decided that it should be based on the needs of each person's work. If it is really needed, the company will issue a set of work clothes every year. 3. The case of the silk weaving industry company requesting to reduce wages, because the situation in the silk weaving industry is currently improving and raw materials are also allocated, so it was decided to alleviate the discussion. 4. The issue of year-end holidays still needs to be seriously considered, and it is recommended that the ministry approve it. 5. Sun Wenqing, a worker at the China Aluminum Steel Plant, is allowed to transfer jobs and his salary remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Regarding the point that the living index in this city is different from the price index in Nanjing, Wu Kaixian made a report.

<h3>Shanghai Tries Traitor Cases, First Execution, Traitor Liang Hongzhi Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday, Two Letters Stated That He Was Not Convinced of the Failure of His Political Career, He Was Calm at the Execution Ground and Died with One Shot</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, the head of the puppet Reformed Government, was executed by firing squad in the Shanghai Prison execution ground at 1:22 PM yesterday. This is the first traitor to be sentenced to death and executed in this city after the victory.</p>
<p>According to the report, since Liang was sentenced to death by the Shanghai High Court, his family hired a defense lawyer to file a petition with the Supreme Court, applying for a retrial. Later, the Supreme Court ruled to uphold the original verdict. Yesterday, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office suddenly received an execution order from the Nanjing Supreme Prosecutor's Office. At 11:40 AM, Prosecutor Zai Rongqian issued a warrant to bring Liang out of cell No. 23 in Zhongjian Prison and escorted him to the attached execution ground. Liang was wearing a black woolen robe, blue silk ankle-length trousers, purplish-brown gauze socks, and white-soled black direct-real woolen shoes. His complexion was white and plump, and his attitude was white. Prosecutor Dai and the bailiffs arrived at the execution ground at 11:50 AM. After verifying his identity, they asked him if he had any last words. Liang replied that he had not yet received the judgment from the Supreme Court, so why should he be executed so quickly. His words seemed to indicate that he was not convinced. Prosecutor Dai told him that he was acting on the orders of his superiors. Liang's face turned slightly gray when he heard this, but he was still very calm. He then requested that his family be notified after his death and asked for paper and pen to write a will. He finished writing from 12:00 to 1:15, writing three sheets of ten lines each. In the letter to his family, he said: I have read poetry and books all my life, but now my political career has failed. Today, I died in extreme punishment. Come and collect my body as soon as you get the news. My family is poor, so there is no need to be extravagant in my funeral. I hope you will be frugal in the future. In another letter to President Chiang, he still defended himself, saying: He formed the puppet government not to seek personal fame and wealth, but to save the people from the fire and water, which is the same as the ideals of ordinary politicians. Now I have been sentenced to death for failure, and it is difficult to accept. He was calm when writing, and did not show any panic. After writing, he still asked to hand over a pocket watch and clothes to his family. He took out a jade fish from his bag, about three inches long, inlaid with ivory and jade. He claimed that this was a relic of his late teacher and asked to be handed over to his family for burial. After speaking, he stepped forward and sat on a yellow-backed wooden chair. At 1:20, Prosecutor Dai gave an order. At 1:22, bailiff Wang Junhua fired a shot from behind Liang's back. The bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth. He immediately fell to the left side of the chair, collapsed on the ground and died. His right eye was closed tightly, his left eye was protruding, his figure-eight eyebrows were upside down, and fresh blood kept gushing out from the gunshot hole in his mouth. After Prosecutor Dai verified that it was correct, the bailiff covered it with a grassy green US military blanket, but the red blood still seeped through this thick blanket. After the matter was completed, the High Prosecutor's Office notified his family to collect the body, and immediately issued a public announcement at the gate of the Shanghai Prison. At 3:00, the corpse was put into a thin wooden coffin by the Pushan Villa and sent to the corpse inspection office on Jiaozhou Road. In the evening, his family rushed to the scene after receiving the news and transported the corpse to the China Funeral Home for temporary placement and viewing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Judgment: Defendant Slanders the Central Government and Destroys the Nation; Extreme Punishment Is Necessary to Serve as a Stern Warning</h3>
<p>Liang is currently sixty-four years old and a native of Changle, Fujian. The Supreme Court's judgment listed Liang's crimes, stating: "The defendant initially served as a State Council Counselor and Senator in the Beijing government, as well as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the success of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, he retired to Hangzhou. At the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, he moved to Shanghai. Subsequently, when Nanjing and Shanghai fell into enemy hands, and the government moved the capital to Chongqing, the defendant seized the opportunity to collude with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Lu, and others to communicate with the enemy and plan for the establishment of a puppet regime in Central China. On March 28, 1938, the puppet Reformed Government was established in Nanjing, issuing a declaration and establishing two houses and eight ministries, governing three provinces and two cities. He appointed himself the puppet President of the Executive Yuan, overseeing everything, and changed the national flag to the Five-Colored Flag.</p>
<p>He presided over the political council, recruited troops, seized customs, and successively signed railway, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking agreements with the enemy chieftains. He operated the Central China Railway, Telecommunications, Salt Industry, and Shipping Companies, as well as the China Development Bank, in collaboration with the enemy. Furthermore, he conferred with Wang Kemin, the head of the puppet Provisional Government in North China, in September 1938, to establish the Joint Committee of the Puppet Chinese Government, jointly issuing a declaration. In November of the same year, he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures, in order to establish connections. After returning to China, he published his impressions of his visit to Japan. In April 1939, when Wang Jingwei betrayed the party and the nation and secretly came to Shanghai to establish a puppet National Government, the defendant, after numerous consultations with Wang and Wang, jointly issued a declaration in the name of the puppet Reformed Government and the Provisional Government on September 21st and 23rd of the same year, respectively, echoing Wang's</p>
<p>advocacy of the peace movement. In January of the following year, a meeting was held in Qingdao, jointly deciding to organize the puppet Central Political Council. On March 20th, another meeting was held in Nanjing, resolving the adjustment plan for Sino-Japanese relations. When the puppet National Government was formally established in the capital, they jointly issued a so-called declaration of returning to the capital and the political program of the puppet national government. At the same time, the puppet Reformed Government and Provisional Government declared their dissolution, and the defendant was reassigned as the President of the puppet Supervisory Yuan and a member of the puppet Central Political Council. On November 20, 1944, due to Wang's death from illness, Chen Gongbo succeeded as Chairman of the puppet National Government, and the defendant then took over as the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan until the surrender of the Japanese invaders."</p>
<h3>Refuting Reasons for Reconsideration</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court refuted Liang's reasons for requesting a reconsideration, stating: "If the defendant truly possessed the zeal to save the country and the people and had the determination to make great sacrifices, even if he could not take up arms to kill the enemy, how difficult would it have been to secretly infiltrate the rear to serve the central government in order to strengthen the forces of resistance and nation-building? Or, he could have lived in seclusion, biding his time, quietly awaiting the arrival of victory. Yet, he knowingly defied the central government's decision to resist and insisted on organizing a puppet government to implement the policies of the enemy invaders; knowingly defied the leadership of our country and insisted on currying favor with the enemy chieftains to seek his own personal gain; knowingly defied the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun and insisted on changing it to the Five-Colored Flag to antagonize; knowingly defied the people's patriotic and impassioned spirit and insisted on subjecting them to the enemy puppets to make them obedient subjects.</p>
<p>The puppet organization was named "government" and divided into departments, resembling the central government, and saying that it was an expanded maintenance committee is inappropriate. As for the establishment of the Pacification Army, although it was said to maintain public order, it was actually at the disposal of the enemy. As for the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Bureau, although it was said to curb the Japanese operation of opium, it was actually using public office to profit from selling it. As for the issuance of Huaxing Bank banknotes, although it was said not to affect the people, it was actually intentionally disrupting finance. Even if the amount of issuance was not as large as that of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, it was only a matter of fifty steps compared to a hundred steps. As for his rampant extortion, although it was said that it was only enough to maintain the expenses of the puppet organization, it was actually providing ample financial resources for the enemy puppets. Furthermore, he did not deny the seizure of customs, nor could it be said that there was no factual basis. Moreover, his</p>
<p>successive declarations contained statements such as "Scorched earth policy is tantamount to suicide; accommodating communism is like summoning bandits; it is the worst government in history" and "The party government that has only accumulated mistakes and harmed the country has lost the people's faith and is on the verge of collapse." Documents such as the declaration of the puppet Reformed Government and the speech on the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing can prove it. Therefore, his slander of the central government and destruction of the nation's system were carried out to the extreme, and how could he claim that it was of a servient nature? Such acts of instigating rebellion, betraying the country for personal glory, hating the party and the nation, and recognizing the enemy as one's father, yet still claiming that he had no intention of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist his own country, then would not the stone statues of Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, who have been cursed for thousands of years, be greatly wronged? If asked of the defendant, he would probably find it difficult to explain himself."</p>
<h3>Reasons for Upholding the Original Verdict</h3>
<p>As for the reasons for not reducing the sentence and still upholding the original death sentence, it was stated: "Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases stipulates that if a traitor mentioned in the preceding article has evidence of assisting in the war effort or benefiting the people, his sentence may be reduced. Since the legal text clearly stipulates 'may be reduced,' the judge has the discretion to consider whether or not to reduce it. If, after considering the case, there is assistance in the war effort or acts that benefit the people, but compared to other treacherous acts, the merits and demerits are not enough to offset each other, then not reducing the sentence is not illegal. Therefore, it is truly insufficient to impose anything other than the death penalty on the defendant in this case to serve as a stern warning and to manifest the law of the nation."</p>
<h3>Zhang Sumin's Trial Continued Yesterday; Chen Jinsheng's Sentencing on the 16th</h3>
<p>Zhang Sumin, the former Director of the Customs Department of the puppet Ministry of Finance and Director of the Enemy Property Management Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, was retried by the High Court yesterday. Zhang repeatedly claimed that his participation in the puppet organization was solely to protect the customs system and safeguard British and American property, and requested the court to summon Shen Siliang to testify. The court then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The High Court concluded the trial of Chen Jinsheng, a staff member of the Judicial Section of the puppet Police Bureau, yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Collection of Clothing Fees for the Defense Corps Has Been Stopped; Application for Exemption of Business Tax on Books Has Been Submitted to the Ministry for Instructions; Director Gu Reported to the Senate Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee of the Municipal Senate held its fourth meeting at 12:00 noon yesterday. Eight senators attended, with Chairman Wang Yansong presiding. Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended and reported on the following: (1) The collection of clothing fees for the Defense Corps has been stopped. (2) The application for exemption of business tax on books has been submitted to the ministry for instructions, but a reply has not yet been received. Before an order is received, the collection will be temporarily suspended. (3) The land tax has been approved by the central government. For every one national currency yuan originally collected in 1937, 1.96 dou and he of grain will be collected this year. The collection will begin after an on-site investigation. (4) Two cases of corruption have been discovered after strict enforcement of the rectification of discipline, and they have been punished according to the law. (5) The entertainment tax is temporarily collected at 40%. A decision will be made after discussion and resolution at the second general meeting. Subsequently, eight proposals were discussed, including a resolution that municipal construction donations should be collected from both institutions and schools during the autumn and winter seasons. Regarding small inns with cubicle-style rooms, it was resolved that the hotel tax should be waived, and a letter was sent to the municipal government for consideration. Regarding the request from the local cloth industry association for permanent exemption from local cloth business tax, it was resolved to forward it to the Finance Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Cars of Traitors Zhou Fohai and Others; Disposal Bureau Sells in Advance</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau received 58 various vehicles transferred by the Military Statistics Bureau as property of traitors and discovered by the bureau itself. Except for those that were damaged beyond repair, most of them were kept by the Military Statistics Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Youth League, and other agencies. The Disposal Bureau, fearing that with the increasing number of imported vehicles, long-term entrusted custody would not be a good solution, decided to sell them in advance, with the original users having priority in purchasing them, and the Disposal Bureau keeping the cash. The original owners of the above vehicles were traitors Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, Qian Daqi, Su Chengde, Ding Mocun, Pan Sansheng, Sheng Youyi, Dai Airu, and others.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Regarding Jockey Club Bonds; Court to Announce Verdict Tomorrow Morning; Plaintiff Demands Repayment at Two Thousand Times the Principal</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the case of four holders of Jockey Club corporate bonds, including Dibos and Solomon, demanding that the legal representative of the Jockey Club repay the principal at two thousand times the original amount, the court is scheduled to announce the verdict tomorrow morning. A reporter visited Gui Zhongshu, the plaintiff's lawyer, yesterday, who said that his legal basis was Article 12 of the "Regulations on Supplementing Civil Procedure after Restoration": "If, after the establishment of a legal act, the situation changes due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court shall make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects."</p>
<p>The Jockey Club corporate bonds were issued in 1934 because the Jockey Club owed HSBC more than 2 million yuan, which was due, and the Jockey Club was unable to repay it, so it issued 3 million yuan in corporate bonds, with real estate as collateral and an interest rate of 6%.</p>
<p>Lawyer Gui suggested three ways to increase the repayment standard: one, based on the price of silver; two, based on the price of real estate; and three, based on the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Gui Zhongshu told the reporter that corporate bonds are different from government bonds because national sovereignty is not bound by law. Moreover, government bonds are borne by the government, that is, by the people of the whole country. The country suffered huge losses during the eight years of war, and repaying government bonds at a one-to-one ratio is to reduce the burden on the entire population. Corporate bonds are also different from bank deposits because corporate bonds are borne by the debtor, while bank deposits are private property entrusted to the bank for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Sends Representatives to Petition the Mayor for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association, due to the heavy burden of donations and taxes, previously sent representatives to the Finance Bureau to petition for a reduction or exemption of the 15% tax on retailers. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the representatives petitioned Mayor Wu again. Wu personally received them and expressed sympathy for the industry's request for reduction or exemption of donations, taxes, and wholesale taxes, and instructed them to await further investigation of the facts before handling the matter.</p>
<h3>Women's Organizations Sponsor a National Products Promotion Conference; Held Today at the National Products Store</h3>

It will be presided over by Dr. Qian Jianqiu, Chairman of the Municipal Women's Association.

<h3>Accusation of Electricity Theft Affecting Business; Claiming Damages of Over 10 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Civil Court yesterday heard a lawsuit regarding the theft of electricity affecting business income. The plaintiff, Zhou Guisun, is the owner of the Xin Xin Printing Company at 64 Guling Road, specializing in printing various small newspapers. In May of this year, when the electric meter was damaged, he noticed that some of the lights in the Lianhe Printing Company to his left were also not lit, which aroused suspicion. During the repair of the electric meter, it was discovered that a wire from Lianhe Printing Company was privately connected to Zhou's electric meter. Zhou Guisun stated that from January 1944 before the victory to December 1945, there was an electricity shortage in the city, and the power company had very strict restrictions on the amount of electricity used by customers. Electricity is the power source for printing presses, and stealing electricity directly affected his business. In August, he filed a criminal self-accusation with the court, along with a civil lawsuit, accusing Chen Yanling, the manager of Lianhe Printing Company. In the criminal part, the defendant Chen Yanling was sentenced to a fine, and the civil part was transferred to the immigration court. During the hearing yesterday, the plaintiff's attorney, Xu Jianjie, based on the electricity bills of the Xin Xin Printing Company for the months of March, April, and May of this year, totaling 422 degrees (during the period when electricity was being stolen), compared with the electricity bills for the months of June, July, and August after the theft was discovered, totaling 272 degrees, concluded that the amount of electricity stolen from Xin Xin was approximately one-third of the total electricity usage, and demanded compensation for one-third of the total income of Xin Xin from January 1944 to December 1945, totaling 16.6 million yuan, as compensation for business losses during the period of electricity theft. The court stated that the case of business losses caused by the theft of electricity was unprecedented, and since the defendant did not appear in court, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Renting Land to Build a House</p>
<p>Fang Yu asked: I have a plot of land that was rented to a Mr. Sun in May 1922 by my mother. Three one-story houses were built, with a ten-year lease. After the lease expired, the house would be appraised by a notary, and the landlord would buy it back at half the appraised price. At that time, the rent was very low, only two yuan and fifty cents per month. Unexpectedly, the lessee passed away before the lease expired. When the lease expired in 1932, I repeatedly urged the lessee's heirs to fulfill the contract, but they repeatedly made excuses, saying that they were widows and orphans, and asked for a delay. I was compassionate at the time and delayed the matter until now, fourteen years overdue. The other party is still delaying. I would like to ask: (1) Is this matter time-barred? (2) Can I ask the court to mediate and recover the losses for the past fourteen years? (3) If mediation fails, can I sue to recover the land without compensation?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] (1) After the lease expired, you repeatedly urged the other party to return the land and collected rent. If it is in the nature of compensation for damages, it cannot be regarded as an indefinite lease. (2) You can apply to the court for mediation. To recover losses, you must have solid evidence. (3) If mediation fails, you can file a lawsuit. As for acquiring the buildings on the land without compensation, it is not in accordance with the original agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Terminating a Child Bride Engagement</p>
<p>Wang Meijuan asked: I am an ignorant and weak woman. I lost my mother at a young age. When I was seven years old, my father came to Shanghai to do business and chose a Mr. Someone as my betrothed to be his child bride. My mother-in-law often humiliates me, and my fiancé is idle and has participated in a puppet organization and behaves improperly. I really don't want to marry such a person, so I came to Shanghai last year to work in a yarn factory. Now I want to terminate the engagement made in the past. I would like to ask: (1) Is the engagement made by my father in the past valid? (2) Does it still take effect if I did not agree to the engagement at the time?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] (1) The marriage certificate is fundamentally invalid. (2) Since the engagement was made by someone other than the person involved, it is not legally effective.</p>

<h3>Third Phase Second Half-Month Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation: Continuous Allocation to Commence Tomorrow; First Installment Totals Six Thousand and Two Pieces</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The total amount of cotton yarn for joint allocation in this city during the third phase is 24,009 pieces. The allocation for the first half of the month was 12,004.5 pieces. Since the commencement of distribution on the 26th of last month, it will be completed today. Tomorrow (the 11th), the second half of the third phase, consisting of 12,004.5 pieces, will commence allocation. In terms of procedures, there will not be significant changes compared to before. The allocated prices for each yarn will remain the same as the negotiated prices for the first half-month period. The only change is that the two periods for allocating yarn in the second half of the month will each be extended to ten days, an increase of three days per period compared to the first half of the month.</p>
<p>It is reported that various Reproduction Product Associations, due to the large number of their members, were unable to submit application forms before the yarn allocation in the first half of the month, and have requested to join the application in the second half of the month. The Textile Control Committee (紡管會) stated that as the first yarn allocation for the second half of the month is scheduled to begin tomorrow, this request could not be considered at this time. Furthermore, according to reports from Reproduction Product Associations, the yarn counts and types previously allocated were not entirely suitable, and they requested improvements. In response, the Textile Control Committee has instructed the various Reproduction Product Associations to prepare two types of statistical data: (1) detailed information on each member of the association, including their actual yarn requirements; (2) the counts and types of cotton yarn required by each association. The deadline for submitting the above information to the Textile Control Committee is the 15th, to facilitate possible adjustments during the second yarn allocation in the second half of the month.</p>
<p>Spinning Construction (紡建) Yarn Types for Allocation</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total amount for the first yarn allocation in the second half of the month is 24,009 and a quarter pieces, which is 6,002 and a quarter pieces. Based on the allocation ratio of one-third for Spinning Construction and two-thirds for privately-owned factories, Spinning Construction should allocate 2,001 pieces, and privately-owned factories should allocate 6,001 and a quarter pieces. To meet the demands of the various Reproduction Product Associations, Spinning Construction will increase its allocation by 100 bundles this period, totaling 2,101 pieces, and will also increase the varieties of fine yarn. The counts, brands, types, number of pieces, and unit prices of the yarns to be allocated by Spinning Construction this period are listed below:</p>
<p>Count Brand/Type Pieces Unit Price</p>
<p>20 count Rainbow Ball Cone Yarn 200 1.75 million</p>
<p>20 count Li Ma Cone Yarn 200 1.75 million</p>
<p>32 count Blue Phoenix Large Package 200 2.32 million</p>
<p>32 count Yang He Baled Package 100 2.32 million</p>
<p>32 count Year Large Package 30 2.61 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>32 count Immortal Peach Cone Thread 30 2.61 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>40 count Blue Phoenix Large Package 50 2.77 million</p>
<p>40 count Shi Guang Baled Package 100 2.77 million</p>
<p>42 count Water Moon Large Package 350 2.79 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>42 count Li Ma Cone Thread 120 2.79 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>60 count Sun Light Large Package 10 5.15 million</p>
<p>60 count Sun Light Cone Yarn 10 5.15 million</p>
<p>60 count Unbranded Cone Yarn 10 5.55 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>80 count Unbranded Cone Yarn 10 6.00 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>80 count Rainbow Ball Burned Baled Package 5 6.00 million</p>
<p>Double Strand</p>
<p>The above yarns total 1,465 pieces, equivalent to 2,101 pieces of 20-count yarn. The total value is 3.6323 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Increased Cotton Yarn Usage</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Reproduction and Allocation Association, reported everything in the afternoon at the Reproduction and Allocation Association, inviting representatives from the Ye Dyeing and Weaving, Knitting, Underwear, Towel and Blanket, Handkerchief, and Handmade Cotton Weaving industries. Regarding the assessment of factories that have declared and received allocations and the investigation of factories that have supplemented their declarations, a resolution was made to expedite the process, ensuring that the number of requests for allocation would not be overreported and that factories that have received allocations would avoid irregularities. According to Mr. Pan, the original declared yarn usage by various industries was 40,013 pieces per month. As designated by the Textile Control Committee, the allocation was divided into four installments at a 60% rate. Supplemental declarations require a total of 14,000 pieces, and adjustments to the declared yarn usage by factories that have already submitted supplements also show an increase. This must be added to the calculation, so the additional allocation will be more than one-third of the original allocation amount. Various industries are strictly setting standards and re-examining the data. It is expected that some factories will have their allocations reduced, but the allocation at a 60% rate is indeed insufficient for the vast majority of factories. The Handkerchief and Towel and Blanket industries originally declared their registrations based on a 60% calculation, but this was not clearly stated, and the Textile Control Committee further reduced it by 60%, resulting in even greater yarn shortages for most factories. Mr. Pan clearly informed the authorities of the reasons for this, but due to the procedural requirements, it could not be corrected immediately. During the last yarn allocation, various industries returned over 300 orders. This time, even more orders were returned. The reasons for this include the unsuitability of counts and types, the sluggish business of the replication industry, and the high interest rates. Larger factories are deemed insufficient due to the 60% allocation, which can be described as uneven distribution of hardship and joy. The Textile Control Committee believes that there is a solution to the count issue. Deputy Director Li will invite yarn mill owner Wang Qiyu and replication industry representative Pan Shihao to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Few Transactions in the Yarn Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was still restricted by price limits, with few transactions, forming a silent market. Guest traders were unable to find purchases, and some secretly added handling fees outside the price limits, with tacit understanding. It is said that the secret prices were quite firm, such as 20-count Special Double Horse at 2.25 million, Special Golden City at 2.2 million, and Red Kui Xing at 2 million. 10-count Gold Real Star at 1.65 million. All were exceeding the officially fixed price. 42-count Blue Phoenix was trading at 2.35 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix at 2.78 million, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 2 million, and 32-count Silver Moon at 2.43 million, which were generally slightly lower than yesterday.</p>
<h3>Steady Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the intensified atmosphere of peace talks, buyers' interest was weaker, but due to the weekend and the closure of customs, the lower prices easily rebounded. Shengkai opened at around 2.39 million, and after opening, the Central Bank gradually lowered the price from 2.395 million. Members of securities firms sold gold to exchange for stocks, further increasing selling pressure, causing the price to drop to 2.362 million. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 taels at a price of 2.365 million. After the low, the market turned around, gradually showing a steady state near noon, struggling to rise to around 2.375 million. After noon, buyers again speculated on stocks under various conjectures, and asking prices jumped to above 2.4 million. As a result, the closing price rose by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Gold ornaments and silver ingots remained unchanged, and silver dollars rose slightly. The unofficial money market was stable, with interest rates remaining at around 15%.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises Unofficially</h3>
<p>The foreign currency situation was slightly more stable, with the unofficial US dollar rate at around 4,130 to 4,180 yuan, slightly better than the previous day. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to above 4,200 yuan. After four o'clock, there was a sudden report of a price of 4,500 yuan, but this price was not widespread due to the early close of the market on Saturday. Hong Kong notes were initially stable but then weakened, purely because the telegraphic transfer rate did not rise. As a result, the closing price fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers retreated to 862 yuan and 865 yuan, all supplied and sold by Guangdong traders. Indian remittance was 1,045 yuan, and British remittance was 14,000 yuan, with few buyers. The official exchange rate for the US dollar was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Situation Gradually Clarifies; Stock Market Morale Boosted; Chinese Stocks Rebound Across the Board Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. At the opening, due to the news of the ceasefire, morale improved and all stocks rose. After the opening, outside buyers successively entered the market, and buying interest within the market was extremely strong, continuing to rise. At high prices, the market gradually showed a rotation, and 176 and 198 were sold, gradually falling. In the middle, there was a major struggle, rising and falling repeatedly, extremely volatile. However, as short positions were fully covered and sellers continued to appear, it gradually became a situation of few buyers with constant supply. The mid-term rise in the situation turned weary, causing great anxiety among long positions. After 11:30, there was a sudden cut in long positions, once breaking below the 600 yuan level. But after this, short positions only covered, and buying interest in 151 increased again. Time was pressing, and a certain broker rushed in after selling, with 154 and 151 mutually covering urgently. Each stock gradually rose to a high price within a few minutes of closing, ending the session. As a result, compared to the previous closing, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn and New Light rose by 50%, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by 70%, and Meiya alone rose by 100%. Cold stocks such as Jinglun, Xinya, and Lianan remained flat, while the rest showed slight gains of up to 50%. The total trading volume was 9.52 million shares. Outside the market, each stock rose slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly stable yesterday, with each stock maintained by someone at a low price, and slightly rebounded. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jiayi Yarn, Hui De, Yechu, Shipping, and Steel slightly rose, while the rest each rose by 50%.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Rayon Rises Again; 120 Semi-Dull Most Popular</h3>
<p>The rayon market was booming again yesterday, especially 120 semi-dull, which was the most popular. Due to the scarcity of goods on the market, the price rose by 100,000 yuan yesterday. 120 bright also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. New Tianqiao goods were offered at 350,000 yuan. 150 bright and semi-dull both rose by 50,000 yuan. Only 75 semi-dull had sluggish sales, maintaining the original price from the previous day. Transactions between factories were very few. Ordinary substandard goods of 712 points were transacted by peers at 3.35 million yuan. Actual selling manufacturers did not adopt it, making it unable to increase prices. Silk goods and bedding slightly prospered yesterday. Exclusive Sheng goods saw a decline of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, due to the abundance of spot goods on the market, with some seeking to sell cheaply for cash.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Yarn Prices Soar; Chen Kecheng Arrives in Shanghai to Appeal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Since the restriction on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, the price of yarn in Guangzhou has suddenly soared. Each bale of 20-count cotton yarn requires 3 million yuan. Due to excessively high export costs, sales are impossible, resulting in over 80% of the 900+ weaving factories being forced to shut down. Unemployment has reached tens of thousands, forming a major industrial and social crisis. Chen Kecheng, Chairman of the Weaving and Dyeing Industry Production Cooperative, flew to Shanghai on the 8th specifically for this reason to appeal to the competent authorities and relevant institutions, requesting transportation to Guangdong to aid sales.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Purchase Cotton; Four Banks Can Provide Funds</h3>
<p>The new cotton crop has already entered the market, and various yarn factories and yarn merchants are purchasing it separately. The Four Banks General Office has formulated cotton pledge remittance measures to provide cotton purchase funds to the various manufacturers. National Banks have already complied with the order to implement it. It is understood that yarn factories purchasing cotton from production areas can not only use it for pledge remittance to the cotton-using areas, but can also convert it into collateral loans. However, cotton that has already been purchased and stored by the factories is not allowed to be used for collateral loans. Cotton purchased by cotton merchants is limited to pledge remittance and cannot be converted into collateral loans.</p>
<h3>Joint Commercial Centers Must Pledge to the Social Affairs Bureau Not to Sell Smuggled or Tax-Evading Goods</h3>
<p>Recently, commercial centers have sprung up in this city, and their scale is quite large. Most of them deal in foreign goods, including daily necessities, consumables, luxury goods, and pharmaceuticals. Whether their sources are entirely imported goods permitted by customs after paying taxes is highly questionable. It is now known that the municipal authorities have specifically stipulated management measures. Any joint commercial center must register in accordance with the law and pay taxes as required. The organizers of the commercial center must all pledge to the Social Affairs Bureau, guaranteeing that the goods sold within the commercial center are free from smuggling or tax evasion, and are responsible for guaranteeing the payment of various taxes. If there is any violation, they will be severely punished or ordered to cease operations.</p>
<h3>Japanese White Paper Resold Via the United States</h3>
<p>It is understood that recently, white paper shipments have arrived in large quantities, so the market price has fallen again. The American merchant, Hai Ning Foreign Firm, recently shipped a large batch of white paper from the United States. According to the batch of white paper, the United States first purchased it from Japan and then transshipped it to our country. The paper did not actually travel through America. Japan has recently launched large-scale production of the paper industry. Transparent paper produced in the past by Japan was famous in countries around the world, exceeding even Germany.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm, Oil Prices Fall; Overseas Flour in Rumor</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a strong influx of sources, with more than 14,000 stones in the North and South markets combined. The South market was firm in the morning and slack in the afternoon, while the North market was sluggish in the morning and tight in the afternoon. As a result, both japonica and indica rice remained unchanged. White Yuan and Yin Yuan also did not rise or fall. The consumption of flour slackened, returning by 100 to 200 yuan. There are rumors of a transaction for Canadian foreign flour, pending confirmation by a foreign telegram. Wheat bran was very slow, with no changes in price. The arrival and consumption of wheat were both scarce, with only small flour mills slightly entering the market. The market trend was flat. After a sharp drop in the transportation of soybeans to Japan, the selling price firmed up, rebounding by 1,000 yuan. Although red sorghum followed arrival and consumption, there were no ups and downs. The arrival of sesame was scarce, and digestion was still active, continuing to increase by 1,000 yuan. After the fall in raw peanuts, shops took advantage of the opportunity to purchase, stopping the decline and turning to increase, with prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Peanuts also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was inactive in other ports, and digestion was sluggish. The market was tired and lacked vigor. The oil market rebounded slightly, with all oils continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat-Priced Flour Supply Exceeds Demand; Merchant Capital Difficulties</h3>
<p>Since the price fluctuations of flour and the shutdown of flour mills last month, the flour flat-price distribution office has been reorganized on the first of this month. The distribution work is now handled by the Flour and Bran Commercial Association. The quantity sold has also increased to 12,000 bags, and the price per bag has been increased to 20,500 yuan. The official price is almost the same as the black market price. Since the start of sales, supply has exceeded demand, with daily balances reaching one-third, causing general flour merchants to be unable to advance funds and feel quite difficult. According to reports from our reporter, the procedure for distributing flour at this office is that 12,000 bags of flour are allocated daily by five factories, and then transferred by the association to various flour merchants for distribution. The price is prepaid by the merchants. Recently, the official price has been raised, and many actual users are waiting and watching, causing the flour merchants to be unable to circulate funds. At the same time, the profit for the merchants distributing the allocated flour is 100 yuan per bag, the association's handling fee is 100 yuan, the tax rate is 300 yuan, the shipping fee is 300 yuan, and the factory price is 19,700 yuan. Adding the above figures together, it is said that the merchants have recently requested various parties to improve the distribution methods.</p>
<h3>Coal and White Coal Diverge; Coal Owners Raise Prices; White Coal (Hongji) Arrives</h3>
<p>Although the quantity of coal for allocation has been approved by the association, there are currently 1,028 members in the association, with each member actually allocated 11 tons. The remaining 4,000+ tons will be allocated to shareholders of the joint venture. Members who hold one share of the joint venture will be allocated an additional 1.5 tons. If the process is handled quickly, distribution can begin in the middle of next week. However, the application procedures are extremely troublesome and cannot be resold on the black market. Therefore, members who currently hold goods are raising prices and closing in, and the market is moving towards a peak. A large amount of white coal (Hongji lump coal) has recently been shipped from Hong Kong, and the quality is better than the last time. Therefore, the market price of Yangquan white coal has also returned to 1 million yuan from 1.1 million yuan. However, Hongji coal fines are in short supply, and prices have risen again.</p>
<h3>Anle Rayon Factory Still in Preparation; Technicians Hired, but No Definite Date for Commencement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, there were rumors that Anle Rayon would resume production this year. Our reporter specifically visited the person in charge of Anle Textile Company to inquire about the details. The reply was that production will resume within the next year. Because ordering machine parts from the United States requires eight months for ordering and delivery, and four months for transportation. If ordered from the United Kingdom, it will take 18 months. Therefore, the period required to resume production cannot be less than one year. The rumor that production could resume this year is inaccurate. As for hiring foreign technicians to come to China, it is also a difficult task. The factory's machines were originally purchased from France, but French engineers are unwilling to be hired, and the same is true in the United States, because there is a great need for this talent in their own countries. Finally, based on emotional connections, three British technicians were invited from the largest Cortauld Rayon factory in the United Kingdom, and they have now arrived in Shanghai to begin their service. After the factory starts production, it can produce 17 boxes of rayon per day. Anle Rayon Factory was established before the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, with a capital of 6 million national currency, and the scale was grand. At that time, a certain giant in the financial world was also preparing a rayon factory with a capital of 5 million yuan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Anle Factory continued to build the factory site, while the latter announced its termination and returned the shares. Therefore, today, after the total victory of the War of Resistance, Anle is the only rayon factory in our country. Because establishing this factory requires too much capital and technical assistance is also required from foreigners, as of today, people in the silk industry have no intention of investing.</p>
<h3>Ge Jingzhong Suggests Ways to Save the Silk Industry Crisis: First Improve Quality, Second Reduce Costs</h3>
<p>Although the Chinese silk industry has been supported by the government in recent years and the China Silk Company has actively guided it, it has not yet broken the deadlock, and the crisis is becoming more serious. In order to save this crisis, the China Silk Company specifically invited representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the silk reeling association, and the silkworm breeding industry to gather in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures. The meeting began on the 8th, and because the problems are too many and very complex, the meeting is still continuing and is unlikely to end in the coming days. It is understood that this meeting will determine the principles, and the specific methods for saving the crisis must be the responsibility of representatives from all parties to conduct further research. According to General Manager Ge Jingzhong of the China Silk Company, the Chinese silk industry is facing a serious crisis. Under the current circumstances, the only way is to seek self-rescue. Relying on government assistance is not the right approach. There are two ways to save ourselves: first, improve quality, and second, reduce costs. The above two items are the highest principles of this meeting, and they are also the key to saving the silk industry crisis today.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Convened a Meeting to Seek to Expand Soybean Cake Sales</h3>
<p>The various oil pressing factories in this city believe that the sales of soybean cake have been sluggish recently, and they can only maintain costs by relying on the actual sales of soybean oil. Therefore, the production of soybean oil is scarce. Mayor Wu believes that in order to stabilize soybean oil prices, production should be increased first. In order to make oil factories increase production, it is necessary to promote soybean cake sales. For this issue, Mayor Wu sought to thoroughly resolve the problem and convened a meeting of relevant parties at the Municipal Government at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Dao Zhongtao, General Manager of the Municipal Bank, He Molin, Manager of the Promotion Department of the China Trust Bureau, Xu Hengshou, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Trade Bureau, Song Yixin, Assistant Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Company, and Li Zuye, Representative of the Oil Pressing Industry Association. First, Mayor Wu expressed his views, proposing to promote the sale of soybean cake to Taiwan or to rural areas throughout the country by the China Trust Bureau to increase agricultural fertilizer or as a raw material for raising livestock. The principles were agreed upon, but Song Yixin of the Taiwan Sugar Company stated that the market price of soybean cake is about 500,000 yuan per ton. Although the company is trying to obtain chemical fertilizer subsidies from the Executive Yuan, even though the price is 600,000 yuan per ton, its fertilization effect exceeds soybean cake by more than 200 million, which is considered too uneconomical. As for how the Taiwan Trade Bureau and the China Trust Bureau will purchase soybean cake, the methods will be determined separately. The oil factory representatives' proposal to apply for a 500 million yuan loan was also discussed at the time.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Launches Export Commodity Loans</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the export industry, the Central Bank has launched export commodity loans. For exporters who intend to purchase, manufacture, and transport goods overseas, the bank will provide loans. After the purchase is completed, when the goods are transported from the place of production to the port, another loan can be made, handling pledge remittance to form a unified entity. That is, the loans for the export industry are divided into two stages. The first stage is domestic loans, which are from the place of production to Shanghai. The second stage is foreign loans, which are from Shanghai to foreign markets. The loan amounts will depend on the needs of the exporters, and the detailed methods have been drafted and submitted for approval.</p>
<h3>Rice Export Restrictions Extended for One Month</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the lack of rice in this city, the authorities specifically stipulated restrictions on rice export. The regulations stated that for rice exports, it is necessary to submit invoices from rice merchants in the rice production area, certificates from trade associations, and two or more documents such as customs declarations and waybills. A certificate issued by the Ministry of Food is also required. Only after the customs verifies the documents can the goods be released. The original deadline for these restrictions on export was the end of last month. Recently, according to the customs announcement, it has been ordered by the Executive Yuan that the implementation period of this measure be extended by one month.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>The government bond market continued to be stable. Unified C opened at around 1,350 yuan, and Chen De as well as retail investors had buying interest. From below 1,340 yuan, it gradually rose to a weak 1,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered between 1,450 yuan and 1,480 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by 140 yuan compared to the previous day. A, B, and D each rose by 20 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 60 yuan. The turnover was about 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern Traders Search for Goods; Cotton Cloth Rises Across the Board</h3>
<p>Due to the large-scale search for goods by northern traders, low-grade cotton cloth prospered. The high-grade goods allocated by Spinning Construction were also raised by 1,000 yuan, and other cloths rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market price for spot goods was 83,000 yuan, while the goods delivered by Spinning Construction were 81,000 yuan. The price of colored cloth also increased due to rising transportation costs for fuel and dyes. Mainland Shilin opened at 125,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>The source of seafood is uninterrupted, but the market is tired and lacks vigor. Shrimp tails, fungus, seaweed, salted and light vegetables, and prayer vegetables have fallen continuously. Dried scallops and squid are rapidly trending downwards, falling drastically by 30% in three or four days. Sea cucumbers are stable in name but loose in reality. Overseas vegetables and seaweed are declining, and no one is asking about them. New mushrooms are arriving in large quantities, and sales are scarce, making it difficult to gain a foothold. Fish fins, fish skin, and tapioca are stable with a hint of fatigue. Only fish maw is in short supply, making it stable and attractive. As for the rest of the goods, due to people's fear, it is difficult to improve in a short time.</p>
<h3>Africa Needs Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>As for the Yangzhuang tea market, although various export firms continue to consider handling premium Zhenmei tea and other varieties, they are unwilling to inquire because the new goods are too expensive. The quality of old tea is poor and does not suit tastes, so the market remains deserted. According to insiders, Chinese tea is currently in great demand overseas, especially in Morocco, Africa. It is said that a certain tea company in this city will soon receive a remittance of a large amount of francs from there, instructing them to pack as much cheap and good-quality tea as possible. However, looking ahead, with the rising production costs of Chinese tea, exports may not be optimistic for a while.</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Mrs. Marshall Visit Municipal Experimental People's School, Inquiring in Detail in Each Classroom</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the ninth, at three o'clock, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Mrs. Marshall, and Ms. Chang Ai-chen visited the Municipal Experimental People's School on Jiaozhou Road. They were warmly received by Ms. Yu Qingchang, the school principal, who reported on the school's overview. They then accompanied them to visit the clinic, home economics room, nursery, and other facilities, and inspected the teaching situation in each classroom. Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others inquired in detail in each classroom with a kind and approachable demeanor. For example, in the first classroom, she asked a student why they were studying at the school. In the third classroom, she asked a student what their family did for a living. In a classroom where they were learning bookkeeping, Madame Chiang Kai-shek immediately gave a question, asking them to calculate three years' interest. In a classroom where they were learning English, Mrs. Marshall immediately wrote the three English words "cat," "dog," and "rat" on the blackboard, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked the students what they meant. The students answered one by one, responding quickly. They then went to the auditorium on the third floor to attend a welcome meeting for the school's students. Principal Yu first introduced them one by one, saying that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was a leader of Chinese women and a world-renowned figure who had spoken in the US Congress, earning continuous applause. It was a great honor for Madame Chiang Kai-shek to visit today. Mrs. Marshall had traveled for peace in China and accompanied General Marshall to Lushan eight or nine times during the summer. Chang Ai-chen was the executive director of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee, a leader in the women's community. After the introductions, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others gave speeches in succession:</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Speech</p>
<p>She said briefly: I am very happy to see you all today. I often think of you because you are the backbone of the future nation. Your future and success are the future and success of the country. I just asked a child why they came to school, and the child replied: To eat. To eat is right, because in today's world, to eat, one must have knowledge and study. However, we should not only have food to eat ourselves, but also ensure that others have food to eat. I also asked a child what service is, and one student said, "Working hard," which is not right. Another student said, "Service is helping each other," which is correct. We should study today with the purpose of serving the country and society. The teachers in your school have very low salaries, but their spirit of service is very good. You should understand the teachers' hard work and study harder.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall's Speech</p>
<p>She said briefly: I am very happy to see so many young people studying here. Many young people in the United States love China, because their fathers and brothers have either come to China or are still in China, and have witnessed the unity and heroic resistance of Chinese youth during the eight years, which they admire very much. If the young people in the United States knew that I came here to visit today, they would surely ask me to bring a message, expressing their concern and friendship to you. What you learn in your minds here cannot be taken away by anyone and is truly your own. You should respect and learn from your teachers, and then your lives can be richer and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Chang Ai-chen's Speech</p>
<p>She said briefly: Principal Yu is an old friend of mine for decades. Principal Yu took the position of Director of the Social Education Department not to become an official, but to promote work. Studying here is a rare opportunity. You should seize this opportunity and study hard. Finally, students from the nursery, women's group, and youth group performed entertainment programs, including "Little Rabbit," "Selling Vegetables Song," "Little Music Team," etc. At about five o'clock, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and others smiled, nodded, and said goodbye amidst the cheers of the students.</p>
<h3>Ms. Constance Vawter Lectures in Shanghai on American National Education</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education held a lecture at the Xin Zha Road Central National Primary School.

(9) Special children, such as those with limps or trachoma, are taught in separate classes. (10) Special attention is paid to training children in cleanliness and good habits. (11) Corporal punishment is not used. For children who violate the rules, teachers and parents deal with them together. (12) Schools emphasize music education. (13) Most school buildings meet standards, and facilities for lighting, ventilation, and exercise are very complete. (14) Teaching in various subjects emphasizes observation and field trips.

<h3>Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Chen Shizhen, Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Requesting the Ministry of Education to Allocate Funds for National Middle Schools</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chen Shizhen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss matters with the Ministry of Education. It is reported that: The national secondary schools are being transferred to Jiangsu. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has already taken over three middle schools and one fisheries school, and has assigned students from the two national normal schools for men and women to Songjiang Girls' Middle School and Jiangning Normal School, adding classes to accommodate them. Now, the normal school students from the Youth Employment Guidance Committee in Xuzhou are also being transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. The funding for all these schools from January 1936 onwards will be difficult to continue. Director Chen specifically presented the difficult financial situation to the Ministry of Education, requesting the Ministry of Education to allocate funds from the central education funds to maintain them. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has expressed its agreement. It is also learned that after the Xuzhou Normal School of the Guidance Committee is taken over by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, it can be moved to northern Jiangsu, because Xuzhou cannot have three normal schools.</p>

Hawks Pott, who is the first person in Christian education.</p>
<p>F.L. Hawks Pott's Speech</p>
<p>Then Dr. Pott gave a speech, saying briefly: This return from the United States is like a dream of Huangliang, but I feel that everything has changed. Although I have been in China for 60 years, I have only stayed in the United States for five years in between. However, in these five years, China has changed endlessly. After returning to China, I have many feelings, and I can't say them all at once. Now I would like to tell you three points, because these three points have been repeatedly asked by countless friends and relatives: (1) What did you do in the United States for five years? Answer: Waiting, waiting, waiting to return to China. In the process of waiting, I also promoted and raised funds for St. John's, and read Chinese every day to prepare for future use. (2) What is the American impression of China? Answer: Americans admire China's ability to embark on the road to prosperity and the realization of democratic politics, but they express disappointment with the current state of domestic division. However, they believe that the civil war will end soon and that China still has a brilliant future. (3) How long will you stay in China this time? Answer: We (Dr. Pott and his wife refer to themselves) will live in Shanghai for as long as we live.</p>

<h3>A-League Soccer League; Qingbai Team Off to a Winning Start; 4-0 Victory Over Soviet Union Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the A-League soccer league, the defending champion Qingbai made its first appearance yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, fighting the Soviet Union at Yiyuan Stadium. More than 5,000 spectators were present and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Before the game, the Soviet Union's Karolyevich presented flowers, and Qingbai's Captain Xu received them on behalf of the team. As a result of the battle, Qingbai won a crushing victory with a score of 4-0.</p>
<p>First Half Qingbai's Wu Qixiang and Qin Bi Gao did not play, and were replaced by Huang Zhendong and Huang Shijie. Qingbai kicked off, and Li Yichen led the attack, but was blocked and returned. Fei Chunhua advanced quickly along the side, passed to Kui, Xu lightly passed to Luo, Shoufu picked up the ball, and Li Sikai happened to be there, breaking the record first. Two minutes before the end of the first half, A Kui got the ball and picked it forward, and Luo Shoufu cleverly tapped the ball into the net near the goal. At the end of the first half, Qingbai won by two goals.</p>
<p>Second Half After a break, the two sides rejoined the battle. Qingbai replaced Gu Yisa with Li Songyun. A Kui moved to the right, and Songyun took the left wing. Shortly after the start, Li Yichen shot and hit the goalpost and bounced out. A Kui added another kick and hit the crossbar. At five minutes, Fei Chunhua and Nicolayev collided and were injured in the foot and left the field. Qin Bi Gao took to the field and guest-starred as the left midfielder. Qu Yongfu temporarily acted as a striker. At a quarter of an hour, A Fu received a ball from the right, pretended to let Yichen pass, and Li kicked it in with his left foot, with Qingbai scoring a third goal. In the melee until 30 minutes, Luo Shoufu broke into the penalty area alone. The Soviet goalkeeper came out to save, and Xiao Luo shot into the empty goal, with Qingbai winning a crushing victory with a score of 4 to 0.</p>

<h3>A News Reporter's View of the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>— This newspaper's October 24th airmail dispatch, Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shu-ching</p>
<p>This session of the United Nations General Assembly is grander than the one held in London this January. I remember that on the opening day in London, there was a misty drizzle, and thousands of British people stood in the rain to see Mrs. Roosevelt. This time in New York, the sun is warm, coinciding with the "clear skies and crisp air" of a "good season." The geographical environment is also better this time. The London meeting was held in Central Hall, with the main entrance in a narrow alley. Once the delegates' cars entered the alley, they couldn't turn around. This time, it is held in the Assembly Hall outside New York. It is in a rural area called "Flushing," with wide, flat asphalt roads, orderly and magnificent buildings, green grass, and the flags of the fifty-one allied nations fluttering. In my personal memory, although it is still far from as magnificent as the old League of Nations building in Geneva, Switzerland, as a temporary capital for a "world government," Flushing's scene is grand enough.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Reporters Registered; China Accounts for One Percent</p>
<p>I have no way to verify when the Flushing Assembly Hall was built. I believe that the arrangement and allocation of the buildings this time are very organized and methodical. The center is the Assembly Hall, with the rostrum on the north side. The rostrum is traditionally divided into two levels, with the seats of the Assembly President Spaak and Secretary-General Lie above, and the podium for reporters or speakers below. The seats of the representatives of the fifty-one countries are arranged in three vertical rows, with the Chinese delegation in the third row of the middle row, almost in the center of all the representatives' seats. The two rows and the back row of the representatives' seats are the audience seats, attracting thousands of American people every day. The "boxes" on the upper front are the press seats, and the boxes on both sides are the "radio reporter" seats. This is an outline of the conference hall. This time, because translation is minimized as much as possible, the seats for translators and stenographers are arranged in front of the podium, unlike in the Security Council, where the translators dominate the "key positions."</p>
<p>Behind the conference hall are the lounge and bar for delegates and advisors, and in front of the conference hall is the cafeteria. The cafeteria is for the use of news reporters and audience members. Reporters have their own reporter bar, which is in the corner of the upstairs boxes. This time, a total of more than a thousand reporters registered (ten Chinese reporters). Many reporters only came to see the opening ceremony and did not come again afterwards.</p>
<p>News Department Director George: Energetic, Strong, and Patient</p>
<p>The director of the Assembly's News Department is Mr. Burns, George. He was originally the News Director of the United Nations Secretariat, an energetic and strong Washingtonian with balding hair. This is the most difficult news officer to be, requiring energy, strength, and extreme patience. It is not easy to deal with so many of the most difficult people in the world every day. In the days before the meeting, many reporters surrounded him, asking questions. One on the east side called, "Hello, George," and another on the west side shouted, "George, is the building ready?" One in the middle asked, "George, where do we park the car?" He answered patiently and explained every reporter's question in detail. The day before the meeting, George convened a press briefing, reporting many "important matters for reporters to note." This "briefing" was convened at the United Nations Secretariat, more than ten miles away from the Flushing venue. George said: News reporters should enter through Gate No. 8. An old American reporter below asked, "Where is Gate No. 8?" George said: "I haven't seen the venue yet. It is said to be in the northwest corner of the venue." The old reporter asked again: "Where is the northwest corner?" There were many difficult questions like this, but the Assembly's News Department did a better job than in London.</p>
<p>The Five Great Powers Each Have a Special Room; Chinese Newspapers Occupy One Room</p>
<p>The hierarchy of news reporters is not easy to divide. No one wants to admit that their news agency or newspaper is small. There are six special rooms upstairs, and George allocated them to Reuters, Associated Press, TASS, United Press, Central News Agency, and Agence France-Presse, each of the five great powers having one. In addition, there were more than ten smaller special rooms allocated to major newspapers from various countries, which inevitably led to many disputes. Shanghai Shen Bao, Nanjing Heping Daily, and New York "Time Magazine" shared one room, which was the only special room for Chinese newspapers. In addition, The New York Times occupied a room alone, and the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News also shared a room because the owners were relatives. Outside the special rooms was the "main writing room."</p>
<p>Oriental-Style Business Competition: First Seen Here</p>
<p>Telegraph companies soliciting business were already a "grand sight." The Wireless News Corporation, RCA Corporation, Mackay Telegraph Company, Western Union, and Submarine Telegraph Company each occupied a corner upstairs, distributing a large amount of typing paper to solicit business. These salespersons' flattery and accommodating attitude towards the reporter masters were truly unparalleled. One day, several Chinese reporters were having a small drink in the reporter bar. When it came time to pay the bill, the waiter said: Mackay Wireless Telegraph Company paid for you. I had never seen this kind of "Oriental-style" business competition in the United States before.</p>
<p>The Uncrowned Kings Entered the Lounge; They Scared Away the Crowned Kings</p>
<p>One distinction was that reporters from large news agencies mostly focused on the proceedings of the conference: the content of speeches, the key points of debates. Their telegrams were fast, and they had ample capital. Newspaper reporters mostly focused on "backstage news." As mentioned earlier, the "backstage" was divided into two parts: one was the lounge for delegates, where reporters were allowed to freely enter and talk to delegates; the other was the delegate bar, where reporters were not allowed to enter arbitrarily, unless there was an exception, which was when they were invited by a delegate. When George and the Secretariat discussed and decided on this method, their intention was good, but unexpectedly, because this group of "uncrowned kings" broke into the lounge, they scared away all the "crowned kings." For the first two or three days of the meeting, the representatives of all major countries hid in the bar, "keeping to themselves," to avoid being disturbed by reporters. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, was stopped in the middle of his way to the restroom, through the lounge, for photos and conversations, which went on endlessly.</p>
<p>American Reporters Made a Face as U.S. and Soviet Representatives Strutted into the Venue</p>
<p>Some representatives of small countries, in order to gain more exposure, often "strolled" in the outer lounge. The Ukrainian representative Manuilsky was one of them. He knew that reporters' pens could "bring forth flowers," so he "strolled" in the lounge at any time. Unfortunately, few American reporters could recognize him: that eloquent, white-haired old comrade of Lenin's revolution.</p>
<p>I talked to Manuilsky several times, and I found him very kind and approachable, unlike Molotov, whose arrogance made people feel a bit resentful. A few minutes before the opening ceremony, a large group of reporters guarded the entrance where the representatives entered the venue. Molotov led the Soviet delegation, with himself in front, Vishinsky on his left, Gromyko on his right, and military advisors in Russian military uniforms behind. The large group marched in formation, their aura very majestic. For a moment, the lounge was silent and still. An American colleague looked at me and made a face.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun wore a very tight-fitting light black Western-style suit. He and Secretary Liu and Secretary Gu from the embassy were the second group of delegates to enter. Representative Guo Taiqi entered alone, very dashing, with a good complexion.</p>
<p>Truman Arrived Late: Clear Articulation and Accurate Pronunciation</p>
<p>President Truman deliberately arrived a few minutes late, which was for security reasons. Secret police were densely distributed around the President. Because he was the Vice President who succeeded the President, for the sake of the United States Constitution, the American people spared no effort to ensure President Truman's safety before 1948. President Truman consistently smiled at the Assembly's opening ceremony. Although the content of his address was very sharp, his scholarly and weak voice prevented the content of his speech from exploding with power. His articulation was very clear, and the syllables of every English word were pronounced very accurately. His speech was completely opposite to that of Bernards. Bernards' speech had power, his voice trembled and was hoarse, but his articulation was unclear, and the syllables were very vague.</p>
<p>When President Truman read his address, he occasionally made some "gestures." For example, when he said that the fear of war had not yet been dispelled, he stretched out his hands. His gestures did not match his gentle voice and slow speech. He often drank plain water, taking a sip every two or three short paragraphs.</p>
<p>Assembly President Spaak: Clear and Loud Belgian French</p>
<p>Assembly President Spaak is a veteran diplomat. His French is clear and loud. When the meeting was held in London this January, my impression of him was that he looked like Churchill. Nine months later, I think Spaak is much older and thinner. A New York newspaper vividly described Spaak's "Belgian French" and Secretary-General Lie's "Norwegian English."</p>
<p>Molotov Entered the Wrong Door: Major Headlines in Various Newspapers</p>
<p>However, the object of most reporters' attention was still Molotov. Several newspapers in New York sent dedicated reporters to follow and interview Molotov. After the opening ceremony, Molotov entered the wrong door, which was published in major headlines in various newspapers in New York.</p>
<p>That day, reporters rarely saw Molotov "smile" several times, which was when he was talking to Truman. He said in Russian, "I am very pleased to listen to the President's speech. It was really excellent." Molotov's attendant translator Pavlov translated it into English, and then President Truman said, "Thank you." Molotov said again: "Deeply grateful to you."</p>
<p>Repeating Pleasantries Over and Over: The Entire Conversation Did Not Exceed Six Sentences</p>
<p>Molotov smiled when he saw President's News Commissioner Roos. They shook hands intimately. Molotov said, "I have always remembered you since the Potsdam Conference!" Roos looked a little flattered.</p>
<p>On the night of the opening ceremony, the Astor Hotel in New York held the first evening party for delegates from various countries, and Mr. and Mrs. Truman also participated. The President spent most of his time with Molotov, and Molotov still said those few sentences: "Thank you, Mr. President," "I am very pleased to hear the President's speech." They talked "as if" they were very close. However, a reporter from the Herald Tribune described it: they repeated pleasantries over and over, and the total number did not exceed six sentences! This is called diplomacy. Let's look at this scene of what is said to be the greatest diplomacy in human history! (Sent on October 24)</p>

<h3>To Mr. Mao Zedong, A Letter Speaking Frankly (Part Two) "The Government of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region" "The Central China Cultural Association"</h3>
<p>— Advisor Zhu Yaotian</p>
<p>Regarding "requisitioning materials" and "confiscating property," among your economic cadres, there are those who heavily requisition goods and completely confiscate property. This is what staunch "believers" and Communist Party members should do as their duty. However, it must be said that even if your economic cadres are right in doing so, doesn't it still come down to the two phrases: "everything is for the Communist Party" and "Communist Party members never lose a penny"? If you stubbornly continue to say "everything is for the people" and "the Communist Party never wants a penny," there will certainly still be people who believe it (note: I was like that a year ago). But sounding good without looking good is ultimately not a very appropriate tune.</p>
<p>Let's talk about "the Party's involvement in business." The phenomena caused by your economic cadres' "involvement in business" are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Insufficient rest, little transportation convenience</p>
<p>Buying and selling are interconnected</p>
<p>Big fish suck up all the Huai River water</p>
<p>Little fish can only face the sky</p>
<p>The above four lines are excerpts from "Economic Song" in my book "Things Seen and Heard in Poetry." It illustrates that all commerce in the "liberated areas" is monopolized by your cadres. To prove my point:</p>
<p>Here are a few typical examples</p>
<p>Land price signs - two wonderful uses</p>
<p>Let's start with the so-called "publicly-run" businesses. The "publicly-run" businesses operated by your cadres include trust companies, enterprise companies, trading companies, cooperatives at all levels, coal shops, salt shops, oil mills, cloth shops, grocery stores, cigarette shops, and bathhouses, etc. In short, except for pancake and fried dough stick shops, I have not seen comrades receiving public grain and wearing public uniforms running businesses. In other industries, it can be said that "Party members are everywhere."</p>
<p>There are two types of backers for publicly-run businesses. The first type is various Party, government, and military units, which are larger in scale. The second type is "honorable veterans" (i.e., disabled veterans as commonly known), which are smaller in scale.</p>
<p>Party, government, and military units determine the amount of "production funds" (i.e., the capital for doing business) based on the number of people in the unit. In name, this "production fund" is issued by the superiors, but in reality, it is paper money taken from the "Central China Bank." The distribution of this paper money within the original quota is interest-free. Paper money exceeding the quota, that is, the capital used to purchase a larger batch of cheap goods, only requires some interest that is almost equal to a handling fee. This illustrates that the funds for publicly-run shops that produce for the Party are unlimited and increase as needed. Therefore, they are fundamentally different from privately-run shops, which calculate interest on capital.</p>
<p>The operators of publicly-run shops are mostly your cadres at all levels who have transitioned from military to government, and from government to business, receiving public grain and wearing public uniforms. This means that the expenses of the shops are less than those of privately-run shops, almost to the point of having no expenses.</p>
<p>In buying and selling, you have the "Commodities Management Bureau" (i.e., the tax bureau as commonly known) to act as your commercial intelligence transmitter. Here is an example to illustrate the rest:</p>
<p>In Huaiyin, you have a relatively large trading company that mainly deals in cotton cloth and newspapers. Every day, they hang a price sign at the door for incoming and outgoing goods, which is an open marker for monopolizing the market. It has two wonderful uses:</p>
<p>(1) Lower the price for goods to be purchased</p>
<p>(2) Raise the price for goods to be sold</p>
<p>If someone goes to buy goods at the lower price, they will be told that it has already been sold. I have a merchant friend who is suffering miserably under this kind of clever method. The fact is this:</p>
<p>He saw the price sign with the deceptively high price of cotton yarn, so he bought a considerable amount of yarn in Yangzhou overnight. When he went through the first customs checkpoint for tax declaration, he clearly stated that the batch of yarn was being transported to Huaiyin. Before the batch of yarn even arrived in Huaiyin, the "Commodities Management Bureau" had already transmitted the news to the company. On the day the goods arrived in Huaiyin, the deceptive price sign was changed. Thus, my merchant friend suffered! If he doesn't sell, transferring it to another place would not only require additional transit taxes, but also the interest from the time and expense would be too much to bear. In the end, he unknowingly said, "Alas! The goods die when they reach the land!" At this point, the batch of yarn purchased at a high price was purchased by your trading company at a low price!</p>
<p>In addition, your cadres openly and brazenly eat public grain, wear public uniforms (i.e., your military uniforms), and carry short guns in groups to run single-handed. Anything that ordinary people are not allowed to sell, such as oxen and certain agricultural products, this group of armed single-handed traders can sell at will. Under such circumstances, what way out do small, self-funded merchants have other than "facing the sky"? As for what your senior cadres say verbally and what is written on the walls, let me advertise it for you again:</p>
<p>Protect national capital</p>
<p>Protect freedom of industry and commerce</p>
<p>Protect freedom of trade</p>
<p>Welcome national capitalists to the liberated areas</p>
<p>The theory of your economic policy is as above, the practice of your economic policy is the opposite of the above. Mr. Mao, what exactly is going on? I'm a little confused.</p>
<p>Let's talk about culture again</p>
<p>If thoughts are aligned, you can thrive anywhere</p>
<p>The culture in your "liberated areas," like the economy in the "liberated areas," is "everything is for the Communist Party." As long as you intentionally or unintentionally learn to say, "The Chinese Communist Party and the World Communist Party are both excellent, and anyone outside the Chinese Communist Party and the World Communist Party is no good," you can thrive anywhere because your thoughts are aligned. Conversely, if your thoughts are not aligned, not only will you not thrive, but you will also be given a hat labeled "spy, reactionary, stubborn element" to wear on your head. As a result, some are monitored, some are imprisoned, and some are executed. To avoid empty talk:</p>
<p>Learn a few typical examples</p>
<p>The so-called "pouring cold water" eventually fizzles out</p>
<p>Let's start with the general phenomenon. You suggest that the government should grant the people four major freedoms. Your newspapers and magazines say every day how the government does not grant the people four major freedoms, especially freedom of speech and publication. In order not to fire blanks, each time you cite some statistics, such as how many hundreds of publications and books were confiscated, and how many dozens of publications and bookstores were closed down. The opposite side of your loud boasting is, of course, saying that only the "liberated areas" do not confiscate publications and books, and only the "liberated areas" do not close down publications and bookstores. But the 100%, 1000% ironclad fact emerges from this issue. It turns out that your "liberated areas" fundamentally do not allow, nor is it possible to publish a publication or book that opposes "excellent" and "no good" in advance. Therefore, there is no need to confiscate or close down. This is a fact created by facts, and naturally, the entire "liberated area" has become a uniform forward culture of "excellent" and "no good"!</p>
<p>I'm getting too far afield. Let's talk about a typical example. This spring, playwright Mr. Song Zhi (now back in Shanghai) and Zhao Huishen (still in northern Jiangsu) went to Huaiyin for sightseeing. I met them at the entrance of the National Grand Theater, which I operate. Because I was about to put on a show and couldn't leave, I went to visit them at their residence (Qingjiang Hostel, which was later burned down) the next morning. Because it was still early, Miss Zhao had not yet gotten up, and Mr. Song had just gotten up to wash his face. After exchanging greetings, we sat down and chatted. Finally, I inadvertently mentioned the matter of Xu Jiucheng being struggled against and fined. At this time, there were three people in the room: Mr. Song, me, and a colleague from the "Central China Cultural Association." A few hours after I left the hostel, Mr. Huang Yuan, the person in charge of the "Central China Cultural Association," sent a note asking me to go to the association to talk immediately. At first, I thought it was just the old trick of "excellent" and "no good." But when I entered the door, I felt that something was wrong. Mr. Huang said with a frown, "...Speaking like that, you have forgotten your position. That is completely the way reactionary elements pour cold water..." "May I ask Mr. Huang what my position should be," I said. Mr. Huang pondered for a moment and didn't answer anything. Then he continued, "...Freedom of speech in capitalist countries is fake. Take the US radio station as an example. State-run radio stations do not allow ordinary people to speak. Private radio stations run by big capitalists also do not allow ordinary people to speak. Ordinary people can only shout on the street, and no one cares..." I interjected, "Mr. Huang, what I said today was in the Qingjiang Hostel room, and the only person who heard it was Mr. Song Zhi. I didn't shout on the street..." Finally, in an unpleasant atmosphere, this case of "pouring cold water" on freedom of speech was finally dropped. This is the first typical example.</p>
<p>"Liberated Area" actors register with nine agencies</p>
<p>The second typical example is this: For a period of time, your newspapers and publications published daily and in large headlines, special articles, news, and reprints about the government's oppression of Shanghai's new and old actors to register, and the opposition of new and old actors to register with the government. The opposite side of your loud boasting seems to be saying again that only actors in the "liberated areas" do not need to register. However, the fact is completely the opposite. Your cadres oppose Shanghai actors registering with one agency, the Shanghai Social Bureau, but your "liberated areas" ordered actors to register with nine agencies simultaneously in Huaiyin, a city with a population of only 40,000. Moreover, each actor's registration resume must include everything from when they left their mother's womb, how they lived, how they learned to act, who they learned to act from, how many years they studied, how many years they performed, and where they have been, etc. As the person in charge of the National Grand Theater, as the general manager of the National Grand Theater with more than 100 male and female staff and actors, I once used a secretary specifically to write this stuff every day. Because the registration resume was not detailed enough, it was rejected twice and rewritten. I hereby list the names of the nine agencies below:</p>
<p>(1) Town Government</p>
<p>(2) District Government</p>
<p>(3) Public Security Bureau of the District Government</p>
<p>(4) Municipal Government</p>
<p>(5) Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>(6) General Bureau of Public Security of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region</p>
<p>(7) Huaiyin Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>(8) Department of Education of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region</p>
<p>(9) Central China Cultural Association</p>
<p>Because of the unreasonableness of registering in nine places, I, as the general manager of the National Grand Theater, protested to all parties. Because I could not take responsibility for the saying "...There are many spies in Huaiyin, everyone should be vigilant in many ways, otherwise if something goes wrong, who will be responsible...", I had to register separately in the order of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine! But at this time, your basic masses were cursing your ancestors for eight generations! This I heard with my own ears.</p>
<p>Culture · Military · Others</p>
<p>Children's theater troupe performs, borrows the venue without paying</p>
<p>Let me tell you about something even more rogue than a rogue. More than two months ago, your Central China Military Region's children's theater troupe, later renamed the Experimental Third Theater Troupe, whose director at the time was your mid-level cadre Comrade Wu, now transferred to the Liaison Department of the Central China Military Region, wanted to borrow the National Grand Theater to perform for three days, to make some extra money. He asked a Mr. Ding to discuss the conditions with me. Because everyone was in the theater business, the result was that the National Grand Theater only charged the children's theater troupe a loss fee of 3,000 yuan per day. All backstage staff and actors helped as usual. Your Director Wu, in order to express his gratitude, that evening, helped the National Grand Theater perform two short plays to show mutual assistance. Three days passed, and the children's theater troupe received more than 50,000 yuan in ticket revenue for the three days. This was probably another example of the "Communist Party members never lose a penny" style. Your Director Wu said to me with a red face, "Sorry, government theater troupes should not pay to perform in government buildings..." Thus, the 9,000 yuan loss for three days was cheated out of. Later, after my serious protest, a portion was recovered from the "Central China Cultural Association," but the more than 100 staff and actors of the National Grand Theater had an even deeper understanding of your cadres!</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you about the cultural performance of one of your senior cadres. After Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, and others died in a plane crash, Huaiyin held a large-scale memorial service. The location was on the stage of the National Grand Theater. In addition to the senior cadres from the entire Central China region, representatives from various units also attended the memorial service. First, Mr. Fan Changjiang made a crowing sound and recited the eulogy while crying. Then, a vivid speech began. I can't remember how many senior cadres gave speeches, but the content of each person's speech was almost identical. In terms of great consistency, it was indeed impressive. However, I always felt that you were not holding a memorial service that day. This can be proved by the consistency of the words of your senior cadres and the towering eulogies of several feet. Below is the original text of the consistent words and text:</p>
<p>Old thief shameless, destroying the Political Consultative Conference</p>
<p>Heroes suffered disaster, vow to pull out Black Tea Mountain</p>
<p>The Three-Step Process in Communist Party Military Teams</p>
<p>I believe that military affairs is the best of your measures. In fact, although it is the same as politics, economy, and culture, it is "everything is for the Communist Party," it is indeed passable in open and covert competition. But this must refer to the military collectives that have not been separated. As for those who come out to engage in production, that is, those who come out to do business on behalf of the army, and the demobilized disabled and sick soldiers, these people are often considered separately.</p>
<p>Your "excellent" and "no good" statements have indeed had a great effect in your army. The acquisition of this effect is also achieved through the three-step process. The order of the three-step process is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) First give them everything at will</p>
<p>(2) Then give them enough to eat and wear warmly</p>
<p>(3) Then instill the excellent and no good statements</p>
<p>Because these people are mostly those who cannot survive in modern society, once they have enough to eat and wear warmly, and feel that everything is at will, they become truly or falsely "excellent" and "no good" for the sake of their real lives. I have personally seen your cadres who have not left the army for ten years burst into tears when talking about their future. I don't think he would have had this mood when he first tasted the three-step process?</p>
<p>Here are a few typical examples</p>
<p>Visiting experts, actually discovered living signs</p>
<p>Along the banks of the "liberated area" canal, there are many historically significant buying and selling businesses, mainly dealing in coal, salt, oil, and other agricultural products. Because of your saying that "buying and selling businesses are exploitative," all the historically significant businesses run by ordinary people in the entire "liberated area" were completely closed down! But soon after, they were all renovated and reopened on auspicious days. When I walked into each expert's house for sightseeing, I found that each house had a living sign wearing a public uniform and carrying a short gun. It turned out that your cadres did not allow ordinary people to open businesses, but allowed "honorable veterans" to open businesses (Note: Honorable veterans are demobilized disabled and sick soldiers). In order to live, merchants had to spend a lot of money, provide dry shares (i.e., shares that only share profits but do not contribute capital), and ask relatives and friends to invite such a living sign to earn a living for the whole family. Mr. Mao! I think you probably don't know about this not-so-small masterpiece?</p>
<p>Let me tell you another seemingly joking military story. The theater I operate is a professional theater, and I am fully responsible for the living expenses and salaries of more than 100 staff and actors. The rent for your auditorium and the disaster relief fees are indispensable. In order to treat the military favorably, I have always charged only half price. Every day, three or five soldiers freeloading has become a regular phenomenon. The military story I want to tell is only larger in scale and more peculiar in method. The fact is this:</p>
<p>One night, when the show was in progress, a few trumpeters came first, each holding a trumpet standing on both sides of the entrance. Then, batches of dozens of unarmed soldiers came. Under the command of a ready command, the charge sounded "di di da da". Thus, dozens of warriors rushed in like an angry tide. At this time, the door was smashed, the doorman was knocked to the ground, the actors were stunned, and the audience ran away. Under the circumstances of not performing or watching, your basic masses cursed you and your ancestors, but then a new show began. Mr. Mao, do you know about these masterpieces?</p>
<p>Let's talk about the people again</p>
<p>A leader pressing on my head is really uncomfortable</p>
<p>The saying "serving the people" is a new slogan that your cadres changed from the old slogan "everything is for the people" when talking about "new democracy." In order to first explain the truth that "the Communist Party does not serve the people" but rather "the people serve the Communist Party," let me first tell a fact that I have already mentioned above.</p>
<p>In the entire "liberated area," especially on the city walls at the entrances of various cities, and on all large buildings, your giant portraits of several feet are all painted. On the upper left side of each giant portrait, giant characters with dazzling red light are written. The original text is "Chinese People's Leader Mao Zedong." My feeling the first time I saw these words was this: I am one of the people of the mountains, and I am also one of the revolutionaries who sympathize with them. But suddenly discovering a leader pressing on my head from mid-air, I felt really uncomfortable. Later, I thought that if the word "people" was changed to the word "Communist Party," it would seem more consistent with the name and reality. Finally, I thought that it was not appropriate to change it like this. China is now a multi-party country. If each party competed to paint leaders on the city walls, even if they did not break their heads to compete for status, I think it is a waste in China where material resources are difficult. I don't know what Mr. Mao thinks?</p>
<p>Writing folk ditties becomes a people's writer</p>
<p>Your senior cultural cadres told me that you have also achieved unprecedented success in the cultural department of "serving the people." In order to prove the facts, you specially introduced me to your people's writer Mr. Miao. According to Mr. Miao, he came from the fields and only studied in private schools for a few years. He is now able to write some things entirely due to the call of the Party. His works are mostly folk ditties, and the sentences are similar to the clappers of "tighten the clappers, slow down, and come to the sesame cake shop." The following is an excerpt from Mr. Miao's great work:</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army has always won battles</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army is skillful in martial arts</p>
<p>Everyone thanks the Communist Party</p>
<p>They are better than our own parents</p>
<p>From the tone of this great article, you can get the answer to the question: "Does the Communist Party serve the people?" or "Do the people serve the Communist Party?"</p>
<p>Let me tell you another story about a public trial of "serving the people." On the day before the public trial, your cadres ordered the village chiefs, and the village chiefs then ordered the people. The original words of the order were: "Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, send one person from your family with a weapon in hand to gather at my place. No matter on the street or at the meeting place, whatever slogan I shout, you must follow me and shout the same slogan. Whoever doesn't shout, I will settle accounts with them when they come back, remember..."</p>
<p>The next night, a person who participated in the public trial said to me with tears in his eyes, "...It's really a sin, a sin. I have never heard of the person being publicly tried. I don't even know what bad things he did, but the village chief led the shouting, demanding that the government execute this bad guy, and I was forced to shout too. You say, if this dead ghost has a spirit and comes to me to settle accounts, what should I say to him? From this public trial story, you can also get the answer to the question: "Does the Communist Party serve the people?" or "Do the people serve the Communist Party?"</p>
<p>Let me tell you another story about an escape of "serving the people." There are millions of people from your Central China "liberated area" who have fled outside. One day, I talked to the cadre responsible for your struggle about the problem of people fleeing. The great theory of your struggle cadre was this: "...There are four types of people who have fled outside the liberated area: the first type is traitors, the second type is landlords, the third type is local bullies, and the fourth type is bad guys..." I asked him, "Then among these millions of people, is there not even one good person?" Your struggle cadre rolled his eyes at me, as if he was saying in his heart, "This guy's thoughts are still not aligned." At that time, I really couldn't help it. I said sternly and affirmatively, "If there is one good person among the millions of people who have fled outside, you, the person responsible for the struggle, should also bear full responsibility." In an unhappy "goodbye," the conversation on the issue of escape ended.</p>
<p>Theory, Party affairs, politics, economy, culture, military affairs, and the people have been "speaking frankly" in general. As for whether it is well-intentioned, malicious, or non-well-intentioned and non-malicious personal opinions, I am not in a position to say. Mr. Mao will understand after reading it, and others who read it will naturally understand. (September 20, 1946)</p>

<h3>Dramatic Exercises for Youths or Children</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>To establish drama education on par with other arts education, such as fine arts and music, the foundation lies in creative activities. The first issue to resolve is the position of drama performed by youths or children. From an artistic standpoint, what status does it hold? This type of drama certainly isn't a mature artistic masterpiece; it can only be considered an exercise. On the other hand, drama education only has value if it can succeed artistically.</p>
<p>This issue is about the relationship between exercises and artistic finished products. And because drama has its own unique circumstances, the problem becomes more complex. Drama's unique circumstances are: (1) using the human body as a tool for creating art; (2) the creator is not an individual, but a group of people who rely on each other—the entire cast in a performance, and this group must also rely on some people not seen by the audience; (3) relying on many material conditions; (4) direct contact with the appreciator (audience) and immediate influence from their reactions.</p>
<p>It is clear that exercises, especially early works, cannot be called works of art. However, works of art can only gradually grow from long-term exercises. The process in between is long and has no discernible segments. It is impossible to definitively separate exercises from finished works of art. If exercises are not art, how can they achieve artistic effects?</p>
<p>At first glance, this is a contradictory phenomenon, but it can be resolved by the attitudes of those who discuss art from ancient times to the present. To explain in detail, one must naturally argue from both the perspectives of creation and appreciation to encompass the entirety of art, but those who discuss it from ancient times to the present mostly lean towards creation. In our country, the Confucian school's "poetry is where the will goes," Zhong Rong's "living in seclusion from a young age, poverty and lowliness are easily endured," the Southern Liang era's "green feelings, ornate and delicate, lingering sorrowful thoughts," Li Zhi's theory of child-like innocence, and the Three Yuan's theory of innate sensibility developed from it: all argue from the perspective of creation. In the West, Aristotle's theory of emotional catharsis, Kant's pure beauty, Tolstoy's theory of emotional transmission, and Croce's theory of intuition all argue from the perspective of creation. The activity of creation is direct and evident; appreciation sometimes seems non-existent. The process of creation gradually develops from the most blurred image until the final completion of the work, passing through slowly and deeply. Appreciation, on the other hand, requires less mental activity and time, and the gains vary in depth from person to person, differing greatly. Therefore, in terms of the impact on people, although the scope of appreciation is broad, creation is more in-depth. Therefore, from an educational standpoint, creative activity is more powerful and the main part; appreciation is the auxiliary part.</p>
<p>Speaking solely of creation, there is no difference between exercises and finished works of art, except for pure imitation. Creation is an activity process, and physical activity, except for verbal art, plays an important role. Therefore, the core of creation lies in the activity itself. As for the results of the activity, the so-called works of art, they are not as important. Only from the standpoint of appreciation is there a clear distinction between exercises and works of art. As for creation, this distinction is neither clear nor important. In terms of creative activity itself, the depth of spirit of a four-year-old child drawing simple outlines on the ground is no different from that of a great painter constructing his masterpiece. Therefore, even though the finished products of youths or children engaged in artistic creation are childish and laughable, the educational effect has already been achieved.</p>
<p>Once the four special circumstances of drama mentioned above are studied, it can be known that they make drama more suitable as an educational institution. The special circumstances of drama explain how drama relies on the human body while using fewer tools, relies more on external conditions, and can never be completely controlled by one person. Therefore, theoretically, drama can never achieve technical perfection. Furthermore, because each performance is equivalent to a new activity without practice, it makes technical perfection even more difficult to achieve. Therefore, there is no clear boundary between dramatic exercises and dramatic masterpieces of art. The mood of children's simplest role-playing games is closer to the performances of the greatest actors, and its impact on their own minds and bodies is more in-depth than that of other artistic exercises.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting aside appreciation and speaking solely from the standpoint of creation, there is no doubt about the artistic position of dramatic exercises for youths or children. And drama education in schools is mainly based on students performing themselves; watching drama is only an auxiliary position. Therefore, the foundation of drama education is very solid, but there are still many theoretical and practical problems to be solved in implementing drama education in schools, so it cannot be said that it has officially begun.</p>
<h3>Praise for "The Stone Flower"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lei</p>
<p>A Soviet Color Film</p>
<p>"The Stone Flower" surprisingly defeated American films, which are known for their color, and won the top prize for color films at the World Film Competition held in France this time.</p>
<p>From the color film "Nightingale Song," which was released in Shanghai eight years ago, to today's "The Stone Flower," we can see that the Soviet Union has made amazing progress in color. Compared with American films, which excel in rich detail, Soviet films excel in freshness and closeness to nature.</p>
<p>The story's subject matter is taken from a Ural folk tale, narrating how a young gemstone craftsman wants to use his talent and craftsmanship to complete a gemstone flower-style cup, but this divine flower is not easy to obtain in the world. He can only complete it with his own imagination, unable to seek its true likeness. Therefore, on every starry night, he has reveries, looking for an opportunity to see this heavenly wonder flower, which, according to folk legend, blooms only once a year. The witch in the forest appears and promises to lead him, but he must use love as an exchange condition. He already has a betrothed wife whom he loves deeply, so to seek the highest art, he resolutely follows the witch on his wedding night. He eventually sees the stone flower bloom and creates a perfect work of art, and repeatedly resists the witch's seductive temptations, completing his marriage with his love.</p>
<p>The theme of this film, according to the film's description, is that artistic works hidden in famous mountains and deep valleys cannot be considered works of art; only when they reach the hands of the people do they have artistic value. But I think that to obtain true art, one should excavate from the beauty of nature to achieve the highest achievement, whether it be music, painting, sculpture, literature... all cannot escape this example.</p>
<p>The greatest success of this film is that the construction of each frame has been carefully planned by film artists. The angle, setting, composition, atmosphere, and color harmony form pages of dazzling oil paintings. You can randomly cut a vibrant frame and take it home to frame and receive people's surprise and admiration. Scenes such as the horn-blowing in the forest, reveries in the deep night, gatherings to listen to stories, and the old man sitting alone in the gemstone workshop, are beautiful and profound enough to leave you speechless. The actors are also excellent, each reaching the depth of the personality and connotation of the role they play. The composure and stability of the young sculptor, the weakness and pity of the old sculptor, the violent ferocity of the gemstone factory owner, and the strange yin and yang of the marquis are all exceptionally outstanding. It is a pity that the ending of the whole story is slightly weak, and the scenery of the mountain stones and the colorful lights in the last few scenes gradually become cliché, far from the novel and beautiful shots full of natural atmosphere at the beginning of the film.</p>
<h3>Zhao Dan and Qin Yi Kissing in a Scene from "Distant Love"</h3>
<h3>Weekly Film Short Reviews</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>A good film shown before the war, originally translated as "Fleeting Dreams." Every actor has a wonderful performance to watch, especially the ending harmonica will linger in your mind and heart for a long time, and it also brings the感慨 of life and what is a "happy family."</p>
<p>Reunion Day</p>
<p>The script is written very deeply, and some places are also very delicate.</p>
<p>The intention of introducing the male and female protagonists at the beginning is very good, using dialogue and action to express the characteristics of the two, but unfortunately, the process of the play lacks a breath and cannot immediately or immediately make its original intention accepted by the audience. By the time everyone understands the intention of this appearance, it may not be possible for every audience member.</p>
<p>The scene of buying clothes is the most skilled and meaningful.</p>
<p>琴逑罗吉丝 played the best, and Shirley Temple's performance was too tender. 佐瑟夫考彭 is above competent.</p>
<p>Tide of Passion</p>
<p>Also a famous work by Hilton, far inferior to "Random Harvest."</p>
<p>The ending turns too fast, with the style of "saving people under the knife" in our country's popular romances.</p>
<p>The male and female protagonists are above average, and the supporting actor George Sanders has many scenes and is also very good.</p>
<p>Peach Troubles</p>
<p>The beginning of the play is good, using the ending of Hardy's previous work "Under the Greenwood Tree," being delayed in the train for a long time without making the audience feel bored, but later it became loose; the subject matter was also grabbed at will, after all, the stage play has been arranged to the fourteenth book, it is impossible for every book to be wonderful.</p>
<p>龐妮泰荷蘭薇, who plays Hardy's new girlfriend, is mediocre. The twin sisters are just using "twins," and there is no great hope.</p>
<p>Moroccan Bound</p>
<p>Among the series of films "Road to ××," this one is not as gimmicky as the previous two (this film was originally named "Road to Morocco"). Often a certain section starts very well, but soon after it falls into a state of stagnation, like the shadow of Delores Lamo in the desert, Bing Crosby singing in the palace, and the final battle and escape, etc.</p>
<p>The actors are still average, but not good; Bob at least put in effort, Dolores is always "lukewarm."</p>
<p>叶凤黛卡洛 can be seen in the array of beauties, she was not yet famous at that time.</p>
<h3>On the Direction and Design of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The script of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" has already been evaluated, so I won't repeat it. This time, the director of the performance is also the playwright. Of course, it will feel familiar and better understand how to handle the script for a playwright to direct his own play. Some emotions that cannot be expressed in the words of the script can be expressed by himself in the direction. However, on the contrary, if everything from the script to the performance is done by one person, then there will often be some places that are not taken care of. Perhaps another director will adopt another method, and the effect of the performance may be different. In the performance, we saw Yang Cunbin's talent in direction, careful but not trivial, organized and not chaotic, and the ups and downs of the plot were grasped just right. From the opening to the closing, the whole play is like the mighty Yangtze River, sometimes turbulent, sometimes calm, flowing smoothly, clear, compact, and not appearing lengthy and procrastinating. From the concubine selection in the second act and the birthday celebration in the fourth act, we know that the director is good at handling large scenes, with many people but not chaotic, and the pictures are arranged very beautifully, which further highlights the atmosphere at that time. The slightly inferior one is the fifth act. This act itself is a bit messy in the script. From the script, everything that happens in the plot must come to an end in this act, and at the same time, the author must start to lay the main foreshadowing for his "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace II: The Guangxu Reform." Furthermore, due to the influence of the plot of this act, the performance in the direction is sometimes rigid and sometimes fragmented, and the emotions given to the audience are also intermittent, which is slightly inferior compared to the first four acts.</p>
<p>The conditions that constitute the scenery are nothing more than lines, colors, and composition. The different uses of these conditions can express remote villages, thatched huts, or prosperous cities, tall buildings, and even this time's Great Qing Dynasty, the majestic palace. As soon as the curtain was drawn, I marveled at the designer of the installation, Li Enjie, who used it to the fullest. The painted pavilions, carved beams, and majestic pillars were enough to express the atmosphere of the palace, used so vividly and concisely, without appearing cumbersome. Especially in the fourth act, on such a small stage, he vividly expressed the depth and breadth of the Summer Palace. What is used more skillfully is the four large pillars and two horizontal pavilions that have not moved on the stage and behind the stage. The designer relies on these pillars to lock the audience in the palace. However, there seem to be too many small objects on the wall of the emperor's study in the second and third acts, which makes the atmosphere not grand enough.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Audience</h3>
<p>— Xiao Min</p>
<p>The "Made in China" new film "Suicide Squad," originally named "Song of the Police Soul," was premiered at the Shanghai Guang Theater a few days ago, and the overcrowding was unprecedented.</p>
<p>These days, some policemen often use their power to force their way into the Shanghai Guang Theater without tickets. Of course, the ticket collectors are not very willing. A policeman said fiercely:</p>
<p>"You be careful!"</p>
<p>"Why?" The ticket collector was unwilling to show weakness for the sake of his duty, and almost started a fight, but he was persuaded to stop because there were too many people. "Be careful, what does that mean?" A spectator in American military uniform seemed to be speaking out of injustice, and glared at him with a contemptuous look because of the policeman's attitude.</p>
<p>"Patrol Officer Zhou" is ultimately an ideal character! When will we be able to appreciate the faces of the policemen trained under the all-knowing and all-powerful Patrol Officer Zhou?</p>
<h3>New Film Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Nation Above All</p>
<p>In a peaceful era or on a night of raging war, we imagine a clear love in the flames of war. A wall, one day the entire world civilization is destroyed, burned, bombed, and collapsed, and maybe there is such a wall left. In the wilderness, a man and a woman meet again under this wall; or a bomb shelter, in the sound of mountains collapsing and earth cracking, a man and a woman meet after countless vicissitudes, and at this time they have a little subtle truth, a flash of time in thousands of years. Eric Knight is a dreamer like us, but this flash flies too fast, he can't grasp it, the glorious deserter and the aristocratic girl can't preserve it, and the director Lee Falk can't trace it. It's over, leaving no desolate gesture. The love in "Nation Above All" has a lingering feeling, and we do feel the brilliance of love, but it doesn't have the sentimental mood, the whispers in the hazy night, the hurried first kiss in the haystack, the small talk in front of the window with lake and mountain scenery, are just a few quiet pictures. In the end, Lee Falk did not faithfully adapt the original work to suit American tastes: the death of the male protagonist did not bring people two cold tears, not even a miserable murmur. Joan Fontaine's love expression really has the full expectations of a girl, and Taylor Power added a steadiness that he never had before. This makes us only remember the fluttering shadow of a couple running and bumping in the pouring rain. They all know what they need, so frank, sincere, and light, but they can't be forever.</p>
<p>Tide of Passion</p>
<p>The original work of the novel craftsman Hilton, making twists and turns and bizarre is still his nature. Like "Random Harvest," he once again uses mental patients as the subject matter. This time, the jealous and suspicious husband is portrayed quite subtly. Killing cats is his first sign, and the subsequent gradual development of conspiracy is more reasonable than "Random Harvest." This film has a good development of the plot. Although it describes suspicious people like "Suspicion" and "Rebecca," it has a very strong taste of legendary drama. If Van Dyke were Hitchcock, his directing technique would make "Tide of Passion" stained with mystery, tension, and terror. Now, his bland technique is only to smoothly introduce the plot, just competent. The foot shadow in the gap of the door in the section of attempting to harm his wife, the procedure of suicide, and the jokes of grabbing the letter and making a strong phone call are the best handled. Other confessions lack atmosphere and color, and the dubbing effect is useless. The ending is too cliché. Robert Montgomery and the actor of the old French doctor have very good results. Ingrid Bergman was not yet famous at that time, and her skills were not as good as Joan Fontaine.</p>
<p>I think "Tide of Passion" is a work around the standard line, and Hilton cannot escape the cliché.</p>
<p>Comrade X</p>
<p>Of course, Hilton is inferior to Steinbeck, but he is really a writer, and his works do not have brilliance and brilliance, but they have purity and brightness. "Comrade X" is an excellent film, or it is definitely not inferior to "The Life of Emile Zola." It is a story closely related to William Saroyan's "The Human Comedy." Steinbeck never wanders in the circle of dreams. From "The Grapes of Wrath" to now, he has been pursuing the essence of human nature. The background of "Comrade X" is the same as "The Westerner," a small seaside town. MGM bravely tried to bring tramps to the screen, expressing a corner of life in a brisk tempo. The archetype of the cunning rogue is created unprecedentedly. Director Victor Fleming's technique is smooth and novel, impeccable, worthy of having works like "Gone with the Wind." Spencer Tracy's performance is perfect, with depth in nature, which is truly enjoyable, and John Garfield and H. B. Warner can understand the taste of it and have outstanding performances. Hedy Lamarr doesn't have many scenes. The director knows her timidity and tries his best to show the brilliance of her eyes. The picture is beautiful, with scenery from beginning to end, which makes "Comrade X" a truly literary film!</p>
<p>Man From The Alamo</p>
<p>Lafcadio Hearn said that although we extremely dislike all hardships, they all help to increase our wisdom. Sam Houston is a person who has cultivated wisdom through hardships. "Man From The Alamo" may be his epic, but I vaguely remember the movie I saw four or five years ago. I can't remember how much heroic spirit Richard Dix's Houston had in the battle. I only vaguely remember how his marriage with the aristocratic daughter Ellie, who was forced to marry him, broke down. It was on the night he was elected governor again. A row of lights under the Houston speech platform shook his bloody life and reflected the iron hooves and wolves on the battlefield. I still vaguely remember Houston's sorrow.</p>

<h3>Improving the "Literary Tea Party"</h3>
<p>— Hualin, Chen Chengyin, Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Brother Zhongnian:</p>
<p>I think the "Literary Tea Party" needs to be further developed. It would be best if you could come to the Xueyuan on Saturday afternoon to discuss it. I think individual conversations are better than lectures. The most important thing is to make appointments in advance and have one or two items on the program: music and singing, or bring one or two works to comment on. It is even more important to invite family members to participate. The atmosphere should be relaxed and not too tense. What do you think, brother? Your brother, Hualin, respectfully. November 3rd.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Brothers Chuntai and Zhongnian:</p>
<p>The "Literary Tea Party" has been held twice, and I have some thoughts, which I am writing down to discuss with you two.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have become more worldly, but I often feel that every gathering should give something to people, otherwise, some people may feel empty. In fact, many things in the world are both empty and real, all subjective. Therefore, even monks with pure six senses still have to worry about firewood and rice. But we want to make this "Literary Tea Party" lively and colorful, so it seems like we need something.</p>
<p>What is this something? In the past, there was a publication where anyone with similar interests could publish articles. We cannot do that immediately now, but we can try.</p>
<p>In addition, we can also promote some programs at each meeting. For example, we can prepare some paper and drawing tools, so those who love to draw and write can do so on the spot, either as a gift or to be kept in the association as a fund. Those who like to sing can prepare a zither and a flute. Brothers Gu Zhongyi and Zhao Jingshen can invite some musicians to participate. There are also many poets who can recite their masterpieces. These things can be tried.</p>
<p>We don't want this association to have too much mechanical function, but if we want to make it lively and often gain something from this association, we can try it. That's how I feel, I don't know if you brothers agree?</p>
<p>If this is feasible, the content of the association will be richer, and there will be more friends. Everyone in the literary and art circles gathers here (relatively speaking, of course). Our aimless gathering seems to have a purpose unintentionally, of course, except for politics.</p>
<p>Busy people are always busy, as long as it's not too vulgar and doesn't involve politics, I hope the two brothers will promote it, and I can only be a supporting player. Your brother, Yin, respectfully. Evening of the 3rd.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Brothers Lin and Yin:</p>
<p>I have read your letters one after the other, and have also shown them to Chuntai. We completely agree with your opinions.</p>
<p>The "Literary Tea Party" has been revived and has been idle for two sessions, and the participants have been very enthusiastic. If the number of people in the second session was relatively small, it was because the second session was held in the Wucenglou Restaurant, in rooms one, two, and three. It was originally easy to find, but a certain school was holding a meeting in front, blocking the way, so we had to make two more turns and go through the kitchen. As a result, the "tea seats" were wider and quieter than the first time, but quite a few people decreased because they couldn't find the place. I met a new tea friend, Mr. Wu Xiuye, who was one of those who got lost. Also, my nephew, Zhu Qiwu, led six or seven friends to participate, but mistakenly entered the alumni seats of a certain school, spending more than three times the price to eat a meal for no reason! I think we should use those three rooms for the next tea party and make it fixed, and improve the access routes, so the participants will definitely not be fewer.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, the results of these two sessions can at least be given 75 points, but it is a pity that they were a little "solemn"! Seriousness is not what we want, as Brother Lin said: "The atmosphere should be relaxed and not too tense." There are three factors that cause this solemnity: (1) In terms of spirit, our old tea friends seem to have suffered from the saying "to understand worldly affairs thoroughly is to acquire knowledge, and to be skilled in human relationships is to write great articles." We are not as innocent as we were fourteen years ago, and our words and deeds are more cautious than before, so our emotions are not as unrestrained. (2) In terms of material conditions, life after the war is much more difficult than before the war, and it is inevitable that we writers have some worries, so it is difficult to enjoy ourselves to the fullest. (3) In terms of age, our old tea friends are already "half-old men with dim vision, gray hair, and shaking teeth." The young new tea friends always feel a little uncomfortable when they see us. They are facing the prime of their lives, and it is just right to talk about love, but among us, except for Hualin, no one has this interest! However, given time, these three factors can be overcome. Next time, I plan to invite a few senior elders to participate: in front of them, we can feel twenty years younger!</p>
<p>Yes, before each tea party, we must prepare something in advance. In fact, fourteen years ago, we also held small-scale art exhibitions, concerts, excursions, and so on. In addition to these, we can also hold very meaningful visits. For example, Dr. Liu Yongchun participated in our "Literary Tea Party" this time; next time or another time, we will visit the Pasteur Institute hosted by Dr. Liu, and ask him to lead us and explain it to us: isn't it good to increase our knowledge? We can also visit the "Xin" and "Shen" newspaper offices; we can also visit the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company; we can also visit film shoots, baking biscuits (Mr. Xi Guansheng once invited us to feast on sandwich biscuits and ice cream), and so on. With our collective strength, we can be worthy of the words "extensive social connections": why should we worry about not seeing, not hearing, or even not eating? The problem is that someone has to be willing to run errands; when it comes to running errands, you two old brothers, Chuntai, and little me are all top-notch!</p>
<p>Speaking of publications, our "Yu Kan" is not non-existent, nor is it small in number; it is a pity that we lack our own "Literary Tea Party," and the strength cannot be concentrated! I am trying to revive the publication, and I hope you old brothers will help. According to the current market price, 3 million yuan can print 100,000 words. Furthermore, life used to be cheaper, and for the sake of interest, we could hire editors on a volunteer basis and write articles on a volunteer basis; now inflation is rampant, and it is really "time is money," and for the sake of our stomachs, we have to add a little decoration. If we don't have the strength ourselves, we have to attack the daily newspaper and start with a weekly magazine.</p>
<p>In addition to friendship, - friendship is the soul of the "Literary Tea Party," - the "Literary Tea Party" should have an active altruistic function: I think of the tea friends who are younger than us. The older tea friends who attend, with one exception (that is, little me), are all authorities in the literary and art circles: why don't they teach the younger brothers? Therefore, even though the "Literary Tea Party" is held on schedule as usual, we can also hold systematic "academic lectures," organize a "Youth Writing Guidance Committee" in name and in fact, establish an amateur "painting academy," and even prepare for a drama troupe, and so on. What we have is talent without "bei" (money), and what we lack is wealth with "bei" (money): if everyone works hard and gathers some funds to make up for the lack, then it will be perfect.</p>
<p>I have been dealing directly with society for sixteen years. Sixteen years of experience have turned me into an enlightened optimist and a believer in active skepticism. I have an iron will and the spirit of a horse: enough for the use of you old brothers and all tea friends! Your brother, Zhongnian, respectfully. March 5, November 5, Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Classical Period Works</h3>
<p>— Bi Jasha</p>
<h3>Random Recollections of the Art World</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Layman Daqian claimed that his eyes could see ghosts. Someone asked about the appearance of ghosts. He said: Ghosts are just human-shaped gas bodies. They appear day and night, everywhere, and avoid people quickly. Their behavior is laughable. Sometimes they are caught off guard and scattered by people. After a long time, the gas gradually dissipates, and they return to their old appearance. Every time I see two people coming face to face, each trying to avoid the other, they often end up side by side. This is a common occurrence, but there is actually a ghost in it. I have tried it many times and it never fails.</p>
<p>When Daqian lived in Jiashan, the old house of Zhenyi was very spacious and had a gloomy atmosphere. He once told me that one day he got up before dawn and stepped out of the room, and immediately encountered a ghost. The ghost looked familiar, but he couldn't remember his name for a while. After breakfast, he suddenly remembered. He falsely claimed that he wanted to make new clothes and ordered his servant to summon a tailor named Jia. The servant returned and reported that Jia had died of illness half a month ago. Daqian kept it to himself and didn't dare to tell his family. Although his words were conclusive, I still didn't dare to believe them.</p>
<p>Qi Baishi is eighty-six years old. Ten years ago, he still had a healthy concubine and a lovely child. In his spare time from painting, this old man often enjoyed playing with his child. He would hold candy and throw it far away on the ground, ordering the child to pick it up and enjoy his laughter.</p>
<p>I once traveled with Baishi. Baishi always carried hundreds of coins with him. When he saw beggars by the roadside, he would give them to them one by one. When he saw people with ragged clothes in the distance, he would definitely ask the coachman to call them to him, and after confirming that they were beggars, he would give them a coin. As a result, beggars gathered in droves, begging in turn. Baishi couldn't handle it, so he threw all his money away, letting the beggars scramble for it. Baishi was very happy to see this, and the passersby were also amused.</p>
<p>Baishi learned carpentry as a child, and was appreciated by Mr. Wang Renqiu, and began to study with him. His paintings have always had a unique talent and formed his own style, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that his poems and songs are also quite good; Old Man Fanshan once selected his best works and had them printed. Although there are minor flaws in the prosody, the overall truthfulness and expressiveness are thought-provoking. Baishi never concealed his old profession, and once introduced me to Chen San'yuan, the Lord of Yangning. When they met, he immediately said, "I haven't read any books." Mr. San didn't know how to answer when he heard this. After thinking for a while, he replied, "Precisely because you didn't read books in your youth, you were able to reach this state, which makes people admire you even more." Baishi's frankness and sincerity can be seen from this.</p>
<p>It was reported that Pu Xinyu flew to Beijing to open an art exhibition, and the chairman summoned him, which was praised by public opinion. Although Xinyu was a royal descendant, he had no aristocratic habits. He chose the Jieshoutang of Wanshou Mountain and left behind his calligraphy and paintings. He originally lived in Prince Gong's Mansion, which also had the beauty of rockeries and flowers and trees. Before the war, he sold it due to poverty. After the Anti-Japanese War, he made a living by selling paintings, and his livelihood became even more difficult. Wang Yitang repeatedly wanted to give him a fake position, but he was politely rejected. His noble character is admired by the world. Xinyu not only criticized Yitang for his actions, but also did not extremely oppose the puppet emperor Puyi. He especially spoke with hatred about the cruelty of the Japanese invaders. Occasionally, when discussing national affairs, he admired Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's character, believing that the country and nation could not be saved without the War of Resistance, and that final victory would be achieved. His love for the country was overflowing in his words. The world only sees him as a painter who is indifferent to fame and fortune, but they have failed to see into Xinyu's heart. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the sky is shining again, Xinyu's opening of an art exhibition in the capital actually contains infinite significance. The chairman summoned and comforted this loyal painter, and Xinyu can also be proud of himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Binhong is eighty-three years old this year. He has devoted his entire life to epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. In terms of his profound attainments, there is probably no one in the world who can surpass him. Binhong has lived in Beiping for many years. The house he lives in was recently acquired by a landlord, who suddenly increased the rent hundreds of times. Binhong could not afford it, and the landlord humiliated him in every possible way, forcing him to move. Binhong could not bear the harassment and had to move elsewhere. Recently, he sent me a letter filled with complaints. In this chaotic world, there is almost no place for law-abiding citizens to stand. It is infuriating to hear this. Binhong is famous for painting landscapes; I don't know that he occasionally paints flowers, also drawing from ancient masters, different from the vulgar. Recently, I saw his painting of a rhododendron branch, which was simple and lovely. Binhong said that he had been practicing flower painting for thirty years, but had not yet achieved anything, and did not dare to show it to the world, but he had never stopped for a day. How could the diligence of the predecessors be dreamed of by the young people!</p>
<p>Today's people often value empty fame when evaluating paintings. In fact, unknown painters may not be completely without merit. Twenty years ago, I saw Yu Shengming, who painted plum blossoms, drawing from Chao Lin Wang Ji, and his paintings were light and elegant, as if wanting to escape from the mundane world. Later, I saw his paintings at a friend's place and had a great conversation. Mr. Yu was very poor, and although his paintings were priced low, no one asked about them. Daqian deeply appreciated his paintings and often added a few strokes to increase their value. Soon someone would buy them, and Mr. Yu benefited a lot from this, but it also shows that people value fame more than substance.</p>
<h3>Herding Geese Song</h3>
<p>— Qu Weng</p>
<p>Eh, eh, willows sway and swallows fly low; Babies know what to do, long poles and wide hats call geese home.</p>
<p>Eh, eh, cranes sing as spring rises, reed shoots grow fat; Let the geese step on the waves, blue waves, red palms, snowy feathers.</p>
<p>Eh, eh, herding geese is good in the cool evening; People on the embankment clap their hands together, who is as clever as Xu's child.</p>
<p>My father raised geese, and once composed three "Herding Geese Songs," instructing Duo Ci to paint a picture, so I completed it to amuse my parents. The original words are recorded above. I was a guest in Xixi at that time, and my daughter was just one year old. Daughter-in-law Sun Duo Ci</p>
<h3>Mulberry</h3>
<p>— Ci Yi</p>
<p>In the spring and autumn of Jiangnan, the girls' soft voices sing the mulberry-picking song:</p>
<p>Picking mulberry in the morning, picking mulberry in the evening,</p>
<p>I am busy with silkworms all day long,</p>
<p>I only hope that the silkworms grow quickly,</p>
<p>And spin two cocoons early, filling the basket.</p>
<p>In the evening, the setting sun dyes the horizon, and a misty haze rises in the fields; the endless mulberry fields are filled with green fragrance, and the endless mulberry fields reflect the red clouds in the sky; the evening breeze stirs the girls' hair, and the girls walk towards the fields with smiling faces.</p>
<p>The singing echoes the laughter, all falling into the evening breeze.</p>
<p>Rolling up their sleeves, they painstakingly pick the fat mulberry leaves from the branches. The fog is heavy, and the setting sun burns the remnants of the clouds. The girls hum as they carry their baskets, staggering on the way home, forgetting their fatigue in their joy.</p>
<p>Spring follows autumn, and many girls in Jiangnan grow up in the years of raising silkworms. They are familiar with the technology of raising silkworms, and they also know the benefits of raising silkworms for themselves. Although raising silkworms is a very busy job, except for screening, feeding, picking mulberry leaves, you have to go to bed early and get up early to pay attention to cold and warmth and safety. However, when they fill the basket with snowy white harvest, they feel comforted and happy.</p>
<p>The girls in Jiangnan love the warm and cool silkworm-raising seasons in March and September - who wouldn't love this peaceful, lush, and green mulberry field in Jiangnan water town?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 88</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>(This is not a myth or a miracle, but a technique in Chinese martial arts. At the same time, those who know the trick know that the dog's weakness is on the root of its ears. As long as the hand is heavy, agile, and the striking method is accurate, a hit on the spot can kill the dog immediately.)</p>
<p>As soon as the dog lay down, Tiger Brother pounced, grabbed the dog's hind legs and dragged it, then spun it around twice on the ground, and released his hand to throw the dog towards the stone wall outside. The dog was thrown more than ten feet high and flew towards the stone wall outside. There was a loud bang, probably falling into the stream. Just after throwing the dog away, Tiger Brother stepped forward again and picked up the legs of the Japanese soldier lying on the ground, probably wanting to do the same as throwing the dog. I quickly whispered to stop Tiger Brother.</p>
<p>Tiger Brother knew that I wanted to check the guy out, so he picked up the Japanese soldier's flashlight next to the body. I secured the pistol and sword, shot a glance at both ends of the road, and called Tiger Brother to be on guard. I took the flashlight and looked closely. I saw that the guy's body was lying on the ground half-sided and half-down, with his head twisted backwards, his teeth bared, looking very ferocious and terrifying! I knew that Tiger Brother had broken his neck. Judging from the situation, Tiger Brother probably was startled by my yelling, and after waking up, he slipped out from behind the tree, sneaked up on him from behind, and used a heavy hand to twist his head backwards. I turned his body over and pulled out his identification tag, which read Sasaki Genjiro, Private First Class.</p>
<p>We arranged this guy's body like a dog, and then walked north along the jungle. After passing the boundary of the fourth building, we re-entered the jungle. We originally planned to linger for a while to see what those guys in the barracks would do, but now that we had taken out the Sasaki Gen patrolman, I was afraid that something would happen soon. After just glancing at the situation, I didn't want to delay any longer, so I crossed the open space from the shadows, passed the fourth four-story building, and reached the back of the main building.</p>
<p>We found a dark corner and hid ourselves. Then we looked back at the rows of barracks. There were some figures walking in the front one or two rows. Except for the occasional laughter, interspersed with Japanese music and singing broadcast, there was no loud laughter or loud discussions. I secretly admired the Japanese army for being able to maintain good order even during free rest time!</p>
<p>To the north, it was dark and vast. When I asked Tiger Brother if there was anything special to pay attention to in this open space, Tiger Brother shook his head and said, "Probably the airfield that the old man mentioned," but there were no airfield buildings, only the ground was yellow and black, probably making anti-aircraft camouflage.</p>
<p>We slipped slightly west along this main building, and suddenly felt some vibrations under our feet. I lay on the ground and listened with my ear, and knew that there must be a giant machine nearby that was running. After a few more steps, I saw small square holes all along the base of the wall of this main fortress. Each hole was about a foot square in size. Just close to the hole, I felt a gust of underground heat rushing out, and I faintly heard the rhythmic sound of the motor running, but I didn't see any light. I thought this was probably the power generation room for the entire area. Looking up, down, left, and right, I didn't see a single power line. Was it because the soil in the north was dry that all the power lines were buried underground?</p>
<p>From here, I could see that the western open space and the eastern barracks area were stacked on top of each other like hills. I didn't know what they were. When I asked Tiger Brother, he shielded his eyes with his hand, like ordinary people shading the sunlight, and stared for a while, telling me, "There are some barrels in front, probably gunpowder; behind that small mountain-like thing, it's all coal. There are also many large and small trucks in front of those round barrels.</p>
<p>Tiger Brother probably didn't recognize gasoline barrels, so he guessed that those round barrels were all gunpowder. As I moved forward, I was thinking: We two people, in this forbidden area, can at most only delay for another half an hour: Because the highest morality of the Japanese devils is order; they have already lost a patrolman, and there is no reason not to be discovered. Once discovered, there will of course be a big commotion and a big search; at that time, we may not be able to hide.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>"Sitting in quiet reflection, think often of your faults; in idle talk, do not discuss the faults of others." Both of these are difficult to do. It shows that it is not easy to be a good person.</p>
<p>The social life of Shanghai people is really too complicated. To sit in quiet, to be calm, and for the surrounding environment to be quiet, how many people out of ten thousand can do it? Every day they are busy with firewood, rice, oil, salt, or cars and foreign houses, their minds full of calculations. How can they be calm? Even if you are spotless, the neighbor's family will either have popular songs coming from the radio or the sound of mahjong tiles clattering. How can they allow you to have a moment of peace?</p>
<p>If you cannot sit quietly, you cannot even talk about "reflection." Even if you reflect, you may not be able to reflect on your past faults. Therefore, we all live our lives in a daze, simply coping with today day by day. We rarely reflect on and improve our shortcomings in our life behaviors.</p>
<p>I often have a hypocritical idea. If everyone, before going to bed, sits on the bed and closes their eyes to meditate on their words and deeds for a day, they will naturally have many feelings. Regret, repentance, pain, and烦恼 will occupy the vast majority of these feelings, and their conscience will not be extinguished.</p>
<p>However, people whose heads are just a burden on their shoulders fall asleep as soon as they climb into bed. Should we envy these people?</p>
<h3>Magical Strange Events</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>...Translated from "Scientific Digest" October Issue...</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the most magical strange event in the world is the secret of the so-called Indian rope trick. The reason is very simple—because perhaps the trick has never been performed.</p>
<p>The magician is assumed to be standing in an open space, completely surrounded by the audience. He takes out a rope and throws it into the air. If the trick is done correctly, the rope will hang there, hanging straight down.</p>
<p>A child assistant grabs the rope and climbs up until he reaches the top. The magician recites a spell, and the child disappears. After a while, the child's flesh falls from the sky piece by piece—the scene is indeed very miserable. The magician fearlessly collects the fragments of flesh and bones. After confirming that none are missing, he puts them in a sack, says another magic word, and the child walks out of the sack, lively and unharmed.</p>
<p>This story has been around for hundreds of years, and with time, it has also been evolving. It was in 1355 AD that China first recorded this event—the man who reported this event said that the encounter was very stimulating to him, and he felt that he had to drink after seeing it. (Translator's note: This story seems to be in Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio was produced in the early Qing Dynasty, about three hundred years ago, so the so-called 1355 AD and the words about having to drink are probably a misunderstanding of foreigners.) Two hundred years later, the event caused a sensation in Germany. Finally, it returned to its old home, India. As a result, everyone knew about the thing called the Indian rope trick.</p>
<p>Has this trick ever been accurately investigated? Yes. The Magical Committee of the Magic Circle decided to conduct a thorough on-site investigation. It was a long-distance job, and investigators were sent to India to inquire about the three thousand spectators who had seen the event.</p>
<p>Many people claimed to know the secret of this matter. One woman said that it was using a long, thin cloth bag, pretending to be a rope. Next to the bag, there was a transforming switch, and a very long stick was stuffed into the bag, so the rope seemed to be hanging straight in the air. However, she did not say where the child disappeared—like many others.</p>
<p>Someone said that he completely hypnotized the crowd; however, hypnosis experts said that it was impossible, and a group of spectators would not all be hypnotized. Someone else said that he saw the trick, but it was on a narrow street with corridors on both sides of the houses. The magician used fuel to create a layer of smoke in the air, so it was impossible to see the top of the rope. However, this situation does not meet the stated rules.</p>
<p>Another man said that he saw the trick, but he was late, and the rope had already been hanging in the air.</p>
<p>Several Indian army officers offered a high reward, as long as anyone would come out to perform it. But the reward money remained untouched. Therefore, the secret of this magical strange event is also preserved—it has never been revealed. The conclusion is: This thing definitely never happened.</p>
<h3>Street Signs</h3>
<p>In the era of the former concessions, street signs were all cast in iron, which was strong and durable and not easily soiled. The enemy and puppets changed the street names and began to use wooden signs, probably because iron was not easy to obtain, and even the old signs were bundled up and taken away. The handwriting was from the same hand, in Yan style. After the victory, the characters were in a new art style, which was very elegant. However, wooden signs are easy to decay, and mischievous children like to play with them, and they are easily painted over. This is their shortcoming.</p>
<h3>Jews and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shi Jing</p>
<p>Jews have only been coming to China in large numbers for five or six years, but they have already caused a generally negative feeling among Chinese people. This is because they lack the concept of nationality, and reality has forged them into selfish, ruthless, and profit-seeking individuals. Every morning, except for the elderly women managing household affairs, there are almost no Jews staying home. Every Jew carries a briefcase and a rattan basket, leaving home for the heart of the metropolis (Shanghai). Besides selling small miscellaneous goods and large pieces of woolen fabrics, they also engage in arbitrage and scalping in Shanghai's banks and financial districts, sparing no effort in dealing with small-value stocks.</p>
<p>After becoming rich, most Chinese people have a mindset of seeking good fortune by chance, while shrewd Jews have absolute persistence in their greed. They can subsist on two pieces of bread for three meals a day, and they also rush to return home after obtaining a small profit. Over time, this has strengthened their economic power. When Chinese tycoons gain economic strength, they become afraid to take risks, while Jews become even more resourceful. About four or five years ago, Shanghai began the most egregious form of hoarding in human history. At that time, Western medicines were bought up in large quantities, woolens became rare commodities, canned foods were completely cleaned out, all materials were manipulated, and the price increases could not be suppressed. Later, it became clear that Jews had exerted their full effort in indirect maneuvers during this process.</p>
<p>After establishing a foothold in Shanghai, the Jews became even more skilled and persistent. They also turned their attention to real estate. The former Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) was their starting point, and gradually Hongkou was hoarded to resemble their homeland. A shop that used to be bought for tens of thousands of yuan (puppet currency) now cannot be sold for anything less than millions of legal tender (法幣). This has built an even stronger fortress for the Jews' economic power. However, in order to digest the fruits they have swallowed, they must make remote areas flourish like lightning. The desolate eastern areas have risen as they wished, and then they sell high and buy low. The Jews launched a total attack on Shanghai's economic lifeline, hoarding large quantities of food and collecting as much folk food as possible. On the one hand, they opened food stores as a cover, and on the other hand, they strengthened their manipulation. Many have become miraculously wealthy in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The most shameful thing in social and commercial ethics today is "product imitation." Famous products are often imitated and sold on the market. But the Jews do not just imitate; they simply plagiarize. They manufacture exactly the same famous perfumes, American cigarettes, daily necessities, etc., and desperately inflate their value to sell them in a mixed manner. The goods sold in the market are naturally of the lowest quality, but they still rely on low prices as a selling point, forming something that the public is happy to buy.</p>
<p>The Jews' "competent and pleasant" display of talent in Shanghai is undoubtedly a significant threat to the economy of the Chinese people in Shanghai. How to suppress prices is a concern for the authorities, and how to monitor the activities of the Jews should also be an urgent task!</p>
<p>Fable</p>
<h3>God, Power, and Justice</h3>
<p>— Gu Dong</p>
<p>Once, Power and Justice met in God's palace. God said, "I used you to govern the people of the world. Now, tell me about your past achievements."</p>
<p>So, Justice, with weary steps, pleaded:</p>
<p>"God, I received your holy decree and descended to earth, spreading your gospel to the world. I gave slaves rest, I gave beggars relief, cats no longer fear dogs, wolves no longer bully rabbits, humanity was freed from war, animals were liberated, I filled the earth with vigor and the universe with joy. But, God! Unexpectedly, not long after, the slaves became sick, the cats and dogs rebelled, the wolves chased the rabbits, and people were forced to go to war again. Yet, joy appeared on their faces instead. Isn't this justice being resisted?"</p>
<p>Power then sneered and said:</p>
<p>"Heh... I took over Justice's job. I made people war, I made wolves eat rabbits, cats fear dogs, and dogs fear tigers. I also made slaves work and let them eat whips. Alas! God, when I arrived, the earth was peaceful, but the slaves frowned and the rabbits dozed off. After I left, the mean-spirited slaves willingly ate the whips, and the wealthy merchants opened their mouths wide and laughed. The weak are meat for the strong, and this has become the justice of the human world! Look at the world I govern, although dark and cruel, it suits everyone's intentions."</p>
<p>Power retreated from the palace, and Justice waited for God's final judgment.</p>
<p>God said, "Alas! What can I say? Isn't Power a hundred times better than you? Go, the human world does not need justice!"</p>
<p>Weekly Chat "I Want to Get Married" Resonates</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After this publication carried an article entitled "I Want to Get Married" three days ago, it aroused resonance among many young men and women. At present, everything is dominated by economic factors. I don't know how many young men and women spend their youth in vain. Men dare not marry, and women do not easily marry. "The Problem of Old Maids" is indeed worth discussing. The few letters published here all come from frank and sincere young people. We treat this matter as a youth problem, not to cater to the tastes of young people. Therefore, although the topic is eye-catching, the content is quite serious!</p>
<h3>I Also Want to Get Married</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Reading the article "I Want to Get Married" moved me very much. I and Miss Ren are truly in the same boat. I am even more afraid of becoming an "old maid," and I believe I am more anxious than Miss Ren because I am older than her. I have already graduated from university for five years and have been an "old maid" who has been working for five years. Although half of my life has passed, I can't just casually end the remaining half. However, my parents cannot support me for a lifetime, and a career cannot be a lifelong pursuit. Especially in this sluggish economy, small clerks are likely to be laid off at any time. In the current society, where women's careers are still seen as "vases," who wants you in a commercial organization when you are older, except for teachers and nurses?</p>
<p>I want to get married! I don't want to add the burden of my life to my husband. I have a bachelor's degree in English, I can translate, and I can type. I can help my husband do all the work in the office. I want to get married so that I can have spiritual comfort, rely on someone when I am old, and fulfill my parents' wishes. I want to avoid being ridiculed by relatives and friends as an "old maid" who will never get married!</p>
<h3>Want to Marry but Afraid to Marry</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Of course, I also want to get married, but in the current era of "great poverty" and "great chaos," if a couple does not have the economic capacity of an ordinary family and cannot cultivate our next generation to be better and stronger than us, then what happiness is there in getting married? In this era, most men who are of good character and high morals are very poor. It is not that I am afraid that they cannot give me enjoyment, but a minimum standard of living must be maintained. This is why many young ladies become old maids, and many young ladies want to marry but are afraid to marry. I once said, "In this era, one must have the determination to sacrifice in order to get married." However, I can sacrifice myself, but I cannot sacrifice our next generation. The knowledge, health, and personality of our children cannot but rely on sufficient economic power.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to marry but I am afraid to marry.</p>
<h3>Know Yourself and Know Your Enemy</h3>
<p>— Zhe</p>
<p>"I Want to Get Married" is a title that is so eye-catching, and here, I cannot but admire the author's boldness in saying what people are unwilling to say. Although the civilization of the present society has reached its peak, how many people, especially women, throughout the thousands of years of history, have been willing to express the hidden pain in their hearts so frankly! This time, the author has finally broken through the inner suffering of many female compatriots who hope to marry but have not yet found a partner, which is such a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>"Getting married" is not a way out. I believe that a woman's desire to get married is no different from a man's desire to marry. This is purely based on the physiological, psychological, and overall living requirements of each other. The so-called "gentleman's value begins with husband and wife" also illustrates the inevitability of marriage. I extremely oppose bachelorhood and let youth pass away in vain. As for how to solve the "I Want to Get Married!" proposed by Miss Ren, this is not only her own eager hope, but probably all women with such a situation want society to give them a definite indication. I think finding a partner is not too difficult, as long as you do not have prejudice and can know yourself and know your enemy, you can win every battle. We see that the reason why general women go down the road of "old maids" is mostly because they overestimate themselves and end up neither high nor low.</p>
<p>This is an old tune, but it is a common situation.</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Life</h3>
<p>— Hui Biao</p>
<p>"When a man is old, he should marry; when a woman is old, she should be married." Love is a need in life. Dupuy said, "Marriage is an episode in a man's life, but it is the beginning of a woman's life."</p>
<p>However, in the current Chinese society, the marriage system is still in a stage of transition between the old and the new. It is difficult to handle men's marriage and women's marriage. I hope there will be proper and appropriate ways for society to organize marriage introductions.</p>
