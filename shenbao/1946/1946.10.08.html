<h3>和談局勢路轉峯廻　馬司建議限期停戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合南京七日電〕國大秘書長邵力子今日談稱，停戰新建議係有一定時限，停戰期內足有充分時間，使和平商談獲得完成。參政會秘書長雷震持見與觀察家同，談和平商談於二三日內當有新發展。又據邵力子稱，新建議係與中共要求政府停止進攻張家口有關，叩以政府是否已同意此新建議，邵氏微笑答稱，想已如此。並謂中共對新建議所持態度，關係中國和平至鉅，希望國民大會可於十一月十二日如期舉行，惟亦可能再行展期，盼望各黨代表均能參加該會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕馬特使與司徒大使，在縝密之研究下，再對和平商談盡最後努力，並一再向主席徵詢意見後，始確切提出新建議，建議內容美大使館發言人及共產黨代表團發言人，均守口如瓶，不予透露，惟就記者今日與各方接觸所得，各方態度均較前數日樂觀，今日此間某晚報曾載有對該項建議之推測數點如次：（一）政府即下令停攻張家口（二）共產黨即下令停攻保定，（三）共產黨於停戰下令後，立即參與三人會與五人會之商談，（四）仍採有期限之停戰方式，至少十日至多半月，（五）國大召集令於國共未得協議前，暫不頒發，若干人士均認爲此種推測實似是而非，記者向共產黨發言人探詢，仍不肯作是或否之答覆，惟稱停戰一事最爲切要，不焦點即無法商談，惟目前焦慮，一切均期待周恩來之表示，俟周之答覆到京，延安電示不日亦將到達，如獲同意，則周可即自滬返京，並立即召開「三」「五」兩會議商決一切問題。據此以觀，多日來沉悶局勢，似已有轉機。又今日各方接觸甚少，上午十時民盟秘書長梁漱溟，應司徒大使之邀，前往訪談，聞曾以新建議內容相告，並盼梁能協助此和平大局之進展，請其轉致書周恩來，促周返京，梁與其研討後，即赴梅蘭新村訪董必武，並作懇談，並赴蘇大使彼得羅夫之午宴。下午三時司徒大全私人顧問傅涇波，再赴民盟訪梁漱溟，聽取中共方面與梁會晤談情形。今日各方情形似呈平靜狀態，馬特使並與其夫人作秋日郊遊，在秋陽下野餐於靈谷寺，董必武亦於午後作燕子磯之遊，邵力子則與夫人到南京大戲院觀夏聲劇團平劇。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京七日電〕昨日馬歇爾將軍與司徒雷登大全與蔣主席舉行重要會議時，司徒大使爲馬帥擔任翻譯，以便嚴守秘密，此點值得注意。外交界對於昨日會議之秘密情形，會後司徒大使立即與共產黨發言人王炳南會晤，並派專使將條件送往上海交予周恩來各點，極爲重視。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕七日國府紀念週後，吳秘書長鐵城·張厲生·吳鼎昌·邵力子·雷震·彭學沛等，曾在會議室一度作交換意見之談話，對當前時局予以檢討，旋對於馬帥司徒大使之新建議一事，則並未提及。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自馬帥司使又提新建議之訊傳出後，和平前途，似又增一線曙光。惟據本市中共發言人陳家康稱：中共尚未接獲此項新建議，僅自報間知悉內容爲休戰十日，而中共所希望者則爲停戰及履行政協決議。如不願停戰而衹言休戰，則此休戰期內，無非欲調集軍隊，準備再舉而已。陳氏稱，如政府必欲如此局面下召開國大，則分裂之局已成，中共方面召開「民大」，成立政府，非不可能。記者當詢其對日前民主社會黨張君勱氏所發表解決國是主張之意見，陳氏稱，張氏主張有二要點，一爲停戰，二爲不特改組政府，且改組政院，此二點皆決非政府所能接受，蓋政政協開會時，張氏之意見有時即較中共更爲積極也。陳氏最後強調稱：時局之轉機惟在停戰，不停戰則一切皆屬徒然。</p>

<h3>周逆佛海起訴書</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕巨奸周逆佛海業經偵查終結，頃由首都高院檢察官提起公訴，起訴書原文如下：</p>
<p>被吿周佛海，男，年五十歲，湖南沅陵縣人，僞行政院副院長兼僞財政部長，及僞上海特別市長。右開被吿，因民卅五年度偵字第七八二號漢奸案件，業經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據並所犯法條叙述如左：</p>
<p>種種逆跡不勝枚舉</p>
<p>（一）犯罪事實：周佛海原係中國國民黨員，歷任國民革命軍總司令部政治部主任，江蘇省政府委員兼敎育廳長，中央民衆訓練部長及中央宣傳部副部長等職，民國廿六年，中日戰事發生，敵勢猖獗，於淞滬之際，我國民政府決定長期抗戰，詎汪逆兆銘，存心違反中央旣定國策，與周佛海，梅思平，高宗武，早具密倡媾和之陰謀，迨京滬失守，政府西遷，其主和行動，更趨積極，首由梅思平，高宗武潛赴上海，向日本軍部代表影佐禎昭及今幷武夫商得喪權辱國之和平基本方案，由滬轉港飛渝，密陳在逆，而汪逆竟贊同敵計，密主媾和，周佛海追隨左右，始終參與其事，復於廿七年底隨同汪逆，潛赴越南河內，由注逆草擬主和　電，交由周佛海，陳公博，携至香港發表，以與敵國首相近衛文　發表之聲明相呼應，冀圖淆惑聽聞，動搖抗戰決策。廿八年四月十二日與梅思平同至上海，結集黨羽推進和運，同年五月五日復與梅思平，高宗武，周隆庠等，隨同在逆飛往日本東京，與敵首密議和平條件，歸國後復以和平反共建國爲號召，在滬開第六次僞中國國民黨全國代表大會，發表宣言，周佛海被推選爲僞中央執委會常務委員，並偕梅思平，林柏生，周隆庠，與日方代表影佐禎昭，及須　等，商討「中日基本關係條約草案，」旋又出席青島會議，與「臨時」「維新」兩僞政府會商改組問題，迨協議旣成，即於二十九年三月三十日，以國民政府還都方式，合組僞國民政府於南京，並發表我國民政府對內對外各種法令及條約協定等一槪無效之宣言。維時汪逆自任僞主席，周佛海分任僞財政部長，先後兼任僞中央財務委員會主任委員，僞中央政治委員會法制審議委員兼秘書長，僞軍事委員會委員，僞行政院副院長，偽中央儲備銀行總裁，僞稅警總團總團長，僞最高國防會議委員兼秘書長，爲敵僞管理委員會委員長，僞物資統制審議委員會委員長，僞軍事委員會副委員長及偽上海特別市市長兼偽上海保安司令，曁上海特別市警察局畏等職，總攬軍政經濟大權，極得汪逆寵信，其在僞職期內，仰承敵人意旨，濫發僞幣，擾亂金融，供給敵人金錢物資，以增加敵寇侵略之實力，且於二十九年十一月三十日與日寇在南京正式簽訂「中日基本關係條約，」竟允日寇有權在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國海內屯駐艦隊，及實行經濟提携，同時，發表中日「滿」共同宣言，承認「滿洲國」以破壞我國領土之完整，迨太平洋戰事爆發後，附和日寇，於三十二年一月九日以僞國民政府名義，對於盟邦英美宣戰，並與日寇締結同盟條約，復以僞特使名義訪問僞「滿，」藉資媚敵，種種逆跡，不勝枚舉，嗣日寇投降，經軍委會調查統計局捕解偵查到院。</p>
<p>犯罪證據極爲確鑿</p>
<p>（二）證據並所犯法條：本案被吿周佛海，與汪逆兆銘，勾結敵寇，秘密媾和共同紙織僞國民政府，歷任前開各重要僞職，於日寇卵翼之下，發號施令，反抗中樞，其在僞職期間，濫發僞幣，擾亂金融，供給敵人金錢物資，以增加敵國侵略實力等情，已據自承不諱，並於調案之僞國民政府公報及僞財政公報，有被吿以僞財政部長職銜發出之各種公文足資印證，至其如何策劃和平，隨同在逆潛赴河內轉港拍發主和艷電，以與日酋近術文　之和平聲明相策應；如何東渡日本，訪問敵方首要人物商談組織僞府問題；及歸國後又如何參加僞國民黨六全大會，曁日寇商訂和平草案，高唱和平謬論，阻撓抗戰國策；如何奔走靑·滬協議樹立僞府，背叛中樞，破壞全面抗戰；如何與敵寇締結中日基本關係條約，發表中日「滿」共同宣言，公然承認僞「滿洲國」出賣民族國家之利益；如何於太平洋戰事發生後，以僞府名義，對於盟邦英美妄自宣戰，使我中央抗戰陣營陷於孤立；以及如何訪問僞「滿」以資媚敵各節，亦據供述歷歷，核與海思平在另案之陳述均相符合，復有調案之僞國民政府還都紀念册(又各和平反共建國文獻）之記載可資參證，是其勾結日寇。違反國策，組織僞府，背叛中央，罪證極爲確鑿。</p>
<p>所持辯護不值一駁</p>
<p>至被告所　辯解，無非謂：（一）組織偽政府，藉以試探和平，動搖敵寇軍心，爲淪陷區人民减少痛苦，且在淪陷區組織僞府，於抗戰陣營並無任何影響；（二）被吿曾於三十一年冬託人向中央自首，供給軍事情報，設立電台，佈置軍事，配台國軍反攻，營救中央地下工作人員，及協助中央發展淪陷區黨務文化；（三）勝利後被吿即被任爲上海行動總隊長，恪遵中央意旨，負責維持上海及滬杭沿綫一帶治安，防制奸僞，穩定人心，迨國軍與中央接收人員先後抵滬，即將所屬軍警全部交與中央接收，不無微功云云，然查關於第一點，按長期抗戰爲我舉國朝野一致之堅決主張，被吿與汪逆兆銘存心違反中央旣定國策，擅與日宼媾和，已屬背叛行爲况更仰承敵人意旨，組織偽國民政府，竊據東南形勢，形成割據之局，其影響於人民心理，國際觀聽者如何深鉅，今猶謂爲試探和平，無碍抗戰，豈非欲蓋彌彰，自欺欺人之談？至僞府在淪陷區所施之一切稗政，如召募僞軍，公賣鴉片，濫發僞幣，搜刮物資，奴化靑年，假借淸鄉，突施封鎖，凡此種種，無一而非禍國殃民之舉，竟謂爲拯救人民，解除痛苦，尤屬指黑爲白，顛倒是非。再查自僞府成立後，編練僞軍，不獨鞏固敵軍後方，且助敵攻我防地，以致敵燄愈熾，侵略益烈，被吿所謂動搖敵人軍心者，其結果竟益藉宼兵爲虎添翼，殊得其反。關於第二點，被吿謂於三十一年冬，曾託人向中央自首，微論徒託空言，不足深信，縱屬非虛，然查被吿早於二十八年十一月四日經最高法院檢察署明令通緝有案，並非在犯罪發覺前自動投案而受審判，核與自首之要件不符，自不能爲妄邀减免之埋由。至營救地下工作人員，密報敵情，聯絡國軍，預備反攻，及協助中央發展淪陷區黨務文化各節，即使確有其事，亦正當太平洋戰事爆發以後，國際情形顯於敵人不利，稍具國際常識者，不難料其究竟，被吿因希圖苟全預留地步，始表示傾向中央而出此舉，何能以此冀邀宥恕？關於第三點，按其時彼吿在上海及滬杭沿綫一帶，曾督率所部與敵軍共同維持地方治安及交出全部軍警，固經軍事委員會調查統計局於移送書中載明屬實，但前者其維持治安亦不過日暮窮途，　蓋前愆，者交出軍權，係在我前進步隊嚴重監視之下，自不得不俯首就範，有何功績之可言。</p>
<p>綜上種種辯解，無非多方飾詞，希圖减免罪責，均屬無可採取，核被吿之行爲，實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪，爰依特種刑事案件訴松條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百卅條第一項，提起公訴，相應送請依法審判。</p>
<h3>羅逆君強甘心事敵　禍國殃民罪惡昭彰</h3>
<p>〔木報南京七日電〕羅逆君强之起訴書，係王文俊檢察官起草，歷述羅逆廿八年二月逃港，八月赴滬參與「在記」僞政府，於廿九年三月卅日僞府還都，任邊疆委員會委員長，卅一年任僞司法行政部長，卅三年春任僞安徽省長兼蚌埠綏署主任，後復與周逆佛海創辦稅警學校兼敎育長，創辦稅警總團兼正副總團長，及僞上海特別市府秘書長等職。在其出任各僞職期間，與周逆狼狽爲奸，媚敵叛國，欺壓民衆，擾亂金融，搜括物資資敵，樹立私人武力，均有確據，並在廿九年底以「東亞人聯盟中國同志會」會員身份，所作「歡迎日本衆議院議員來華諸事」一文，尤可使其甘願事敵禍國之心燭照無遺，故羅逆雖曉曉於其出任僞職，僅係由於「與周佛海私人感情關係，決無侵害人民反抗本國之行爲」，仍無足以掩蓋衆目昭彰，見諸楮　之犯罪事實。至其所僞稱「勝利前後與中央有聯繫，進行策反工作，有功接收」一點，全爲純憑空言，決無證據，即有亦屬投機取巧，不是减輕其應受之刑罰。核其所爲，實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪嫌，爰依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百卅一條第一項起訴。</p>

<h3>歡迎英國商業訪華團與克利浦斯夫人</h3>
<p>英國商業訪華團一行，將於今日飛抵上海。同時，英國援華聯合會主席克利浦期夫人，偕其愛女亦將於明日乘坐專機，飛抵首都。商業訪華團與克利浦斯夫人的相繼蒞止，萬里東來，其所負的使命與任務雖有不同，但俱爲我們在戰時的盟友對我們關注的表示。對於他們的來，我們謹於此表示我們衷誠的歡迎。</p>
<p>中英兩國的關係素稱密切，這種傳統的關係，更因這次反侵略戰事而益臻凝固。在人類文明感到最嚴重戚脅的時候，在歐洲獨立抵拒着納粹狂燄的是英國。常整個歐洲爲黑暗所席捲以去的時候，亦惟賴英國照明了歐洲乃至世界各處的人心。敦克爾克大軍之撤退，以及不列顚之戰的進行，全世界具有正義感的人，都關心着戰事的結果。英國軍民的艱苦奮鬥，使戈林及其所向無敵的空軍卒遭失敗，正是納粹崩潰的先兆。凡此種種，我們中國人民最爲了解，因爲中國在遠東所遭遇的也大致相同。我們中國人民，在八年戰爭中，前四年也多少與英國人民同樣英勇地在東亞抵拒着日本軍閥的侵略。此中况味，中英兩國人民自然最能相互了解。使我們特別感奮的，便是在克利浦斯夫人所領導下的英國援華聯合會對我們中國人民的關切，在歐洲大戰正在劇烈進行之際，猶復時時寄予我們以物質上的救援。對於這種眞情的流露，中國人民將永感其惠，矢毋相忘。我們曉得英國自身，當時正在進行一個空前的搏門，而還能時時照顧我們，這種友愛的精神，感動我們。這眞是人類愛至上的表現。而這些都在克利浦斯夫人的領導呼號下纔會有的。對於這位中國友人，我們謹於此表示我國深切的謝意。</p>
<p>然而民族間的交往，却不完全建築在人道的基礎上的。惟其如此。我們對於英國商業訪華團的東來。特別感到欣慰。中英的經濟關係向稱緊密，今日矗立在中國工商業中心上海的高樓大厦，有不少向曾致力於中英經濟關係推進。在過去二三十年巾，中英的經濟關係，因日本的崛起而受到波動，英國原來在中國國際貿易上居首位的地位，終被日本攫奪以去。如今日本戰敗，世界局面一新，而英國商業訪華團適於此際蒞臨，對於促進中英經濟關係，特別是貿易關係上，深信必將大有裨益。茲當訪華團蒞臨之初，願就中英貿易關係上，略抒所見。</p>
<p>第一，中國自勝利一年來，因爲政局的尙未安定，致交通阻滯，對外貿易，大受影響。目前中國的對外貿易，呈着畸形的發展。這是戰後秩序尙未回復到正常的時候所難免的現象。在現在的情勢下，我們看見有大量不必要往往是奢侈品的輸入，同時，出口貿易尙未回復它應有的地位。據倫敦國外貿易當局所發表的數字，自去年八月至本年三月這六個月間，英國出口至華貨物價値一百另四萬英磅，在同一時期內，由中國進口貨物價値祇十八萬英磅，英國對華出超九十六萬磅。此在中國，即我們對英貿易在此六個月間人超九十六萬磅。這個數字雖則並不怎樣驚人，但究竟表示着中英貿易尙未趨於正常。如何使中英貿易趨於正常，雖其間的關係並不單純，要爲商業訪華團一個主要的課題。</p>
<p>第二，中國抗拒日本軍閥侵略歷時最久創痛最深，此番戰事終了，亟圖復興建國。所以在此後我們的國民經濟生活上，決不能容許以前的放任自由。我們雖不主張採取統制政策，但究不能不有相當的計劃。過去的時代是過去了，決不會再回來。在這個時候，對於中英貿易的將來作一個檢討，對於雙方皆有裨益。因爲中英間的商務關係較爲悠久，所以在中國人民的心目中，對於英國的商品均有良好的認識；品質優良，耐用可靠，代表了一般中國人民對於英國商品的觀感。所以在中國人民中，他們很願意看見中英的貿易關係能够　復到昔日繁榮。但是此後中國將踏上建國的道路，我們希望英國的對華　出能夠多趨於工業工具如機械之類，以協助我國的復興。這對於中國的建國固將大有裨益，而使中國工業興盛，購買力才可提高，這在中英關係上亦必能樹一個永久的良好基礎。</p>
<p>第三，自一九四五年中央新約簽訂以來，原期於六個月內訂立中英商約，祇因其時戰事方殷，隨後又以國府還都及其它種種關係，一再遷延。茲者環境變異，聞中美商約亦經草訂，正應乘此時機，開始進行中英商約之簽訂，以奠定重建對華貿易之基礎。至於其它有關中英貿易各點，訪華團經歷中國各大城市，觀察所及，所得必多。不過其中有一點，似亦不妨乘此一提，即英國在華或對華商業所取之方法，或因時代的變異，應採必要的改革。買辦階級，過去曾與中國的對外貿易結着深緣，而在中國人民的心目中却有極不良的印象。倘若將來的中英貿易，依舊須經過這些聲名狼藉的買辦制度，則在中國人民中是不會有好感的。這時代是過去了，我們要以一番至誠來迎新時代的來到。</p>
<p>願克利浦斯夫人旅居健康！願英國商業訪華團各團員旅居健康！</p>
<h3>中國商何處去？</h3>
<p>上海的市面，無疑地。是以一般批發性質的行號勢力爲最大。他們的主顧，近目本街，遠至各行省；　他們的貨物，包羅環球各國，以及各地土產。凡各式茶會，公會，市塲，都是他門飛躍的塲所。在他們中間，歷史最悠久的，可以遠溯到明季；力量最雄厚的，在海外南洋，日本等處向來設有分莊，甚或自設堆棧，工塲，工廠，以及金融機構。簡單地說：這些批發性質的行號實是本埠商業的中堅。</p>
<p>不過這些中堅份子，到底居其少數，大多數的行號，還不是左手進來，右乎出去？就進口說：他們並沒有向外洋直接定過貨。就出口說：他們也並沒有向各內地直接辦過貨。他們活動的範圍，無非是把當地現有的物資，翻來覆去，搬搬家，在其中揩些油水罷了。時代不同了，對於中間商這一階級，大家也就發生了許多反感。其一，是轉手愈多，成本愈大了，助長了物價的漲風。其二，是投機囤積的事實，就在這種形勢下造成。其三，他們是純粹的分利者，並不是生產者。現代流行的合作制度，就是針對着這些中間商而設；目前逐漸推廣的直接配售和配給制度，也俱以越出這些巾間商爲目標。這些新的制度，目前雖還在發軔之中，但潛勢力已不可侮，那些中間商，應已感受到相當的威脅了吧。</p>
<p>這裏隨便舉幾個例子：紡建開紗，紗號家老是向隅，分不到餘瀝，於是發生了不平之鳴。台糖公司，一度跳過了糖行，直接配售與門售店家，因此引起了軒然的大波。滬西滬南等處，組織了幾個蔬菜合作社，曾經屢次和行商發生過摩擦。燃料管理委員會囊括了壟斷了煤的買賣，煤號家只得　柴炭煤球來支撑門面。社會局的配米，是以門售的米號爲對象的，當米價審議會沒有成立，即白米無法採辦的時候，一般米行也弄得束手無策。現在食油又將直接配售；小麥的對做（即行與行間）絕對禁止；絲茶兩項，自從中蠶與各大規模的茶葉公司成立後，原來的絲號茶棧也都相形見絀；在牲畜市塲時期，原來的猪行猪棧，並且一齊關過門。照此看來，潮流所趨，最主要的幾種商業，都已發生過問題。</p>
<p>我們知道；凡製造廠，批發商，和零售商，各有各的任務和性能，任何一部份，要加以根木地消滅，那是不可能的。不過在這經濟上的非常時期，要恢復到戰前那樣放任的狀態，也是同樣地不可能的。不看見英美諸國的管制政策，到如今還沒有完全放棄嗎？今日我國的外滙已統制了，逖出口都受到相當的限制；加上物資缺乏，物價太高，逼得政府採取配售一類的平價辦法，一方面各式的消費合作社又普遍地在推行着。此類設施，與一般行號的利害，都未免有點衝突。然而潮流所趨，至少在相當的時期以內，却也無法可以避免。所以要維護他們原來的事業、和顧全這一大　人的生意，生計，必須要順應着這個潮流、加以積極的補救和革新。以求適應這個新環境。倘不此之圖，徒然聽天由命，坐受淘汰，固是可悲，就是自背歷史，求人同情，亦復於事何補？</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州訊〕蘇浙皖區接收工作淸查團　蘇組，於本月三日由組長范予遂偕委員吳滄洲·林光損·吳振亞·暨隨員等蒞蘇，下榻樂鄉飯店，四日接見各機關首長，及敵產蘇分處，聽取報吿，茲將經過詳情分誌如后：敵產處報吿物資標售，直接處理者一億九千九百餘萬元，委託代辦者三十二億五千四百餘萬元，款由中信局轉解國庫，關於處理房地產部份，發還民產六十二件，暫准保管十二件，呈報核辦廿六件，調查辦理者卅三件，確定敵產五件，未確定八件，共一百四十六件。該團於四日不午三時，特召集全蘇各機關舉行座談會，到蘇高院孫院長，韓首席，商會理監事長張壽鵬·范君博·地方法院汪院長，　首席，第二區專員許寶光，逯縣長，暨駐軍傘兵總隊參謀長，憲兵隊長等廿餘人，王省主席特派吳主任秘書聞天來蘇參加。范組長親臨主持，首先報吿淸查目的，並希參加各機關提出原始淸册，最後闡述該團立塲，繼由參加各首長孫院長，逯縣長等，先後發表意見，並即席報吿於去年勝利後復員接收時情形，頗爲週詳，座談至晚七時始畢。五日上午九時起，范組長及各委員分別視察各接收工廠倉庫，並軍方接收之糧秣庫，全日視察五處，下午縣府及經濟部京滬地區特派員駐蘇辦公處等兩機關，均有原始淸册送呈該團，其餘各機關亦有報吿，但對原始淸册，咸稱勝利後先經國軍接收，各該機關大都係向軍方接收云云。六日爲星期例假，該團已決定全日整理各項重要文件，七日起再繼續視察倉庫。據范組長見吿，蘇州一般情形，較無錫爲佳，總計收到控訴函共十餘件，內僅三件係關於蘇州，其餘均爲人民與政府間糾紛事件，該團預定八日離蘇赴鎭，約留一宵，雙十節須趕返南京。</p>

<h3>交通警吹哨子用意</h3>
<p>本市中區交通秩序經整頓以來，雖未十分見効，然而已經是好多了，其中最有効的措置，一是規定單行街道，一是不許大轉灣，這兩樁事，是最切實際的需要，亦是最能生効的辦法。據最近十日的情形，在設計及指揮方面，毫無疑問的是盡了相當的力　，不過在宣傳方面，仍然感覺到未够，因爲交通秩序是要大家去遵守，行人黃包車伕，三輪車伕，汽車司機等，均要切實去從自身來維特秩序，但是想達成這種効果，必須使各色人等，統統要先明瞭這交通的規則，以及行車的秩序，同各種設備的用意。我以爲公用局方面，應當編印交通規章的簡明小册子，發給每一個車夫及司機，並且更須要發給每一個市民。更要擴大標語。</p>
<p>我在中區看見一樁事，是十字路口紅路燈變幻時，警察吹哨子，哨子一吹，車輛由停而即開動了，但是在橫的方向街道上的車子，有時可以衝到十字中心而停在警察身旁，這是什麽原故？雖然是小事，然而亦値得一說，在歐美城市這紅綠燈管制，不是僅僅紅綠二色，其中尙有黃色一種，紅色是停，綠色是行，黃色呢？是預備的意思。例如在紅燈的時間，車輛停的停，行的行，紅色後則爲黃色，這是預備的信號，在行動的車輛，要減低速度預備停車，那在停止的車輛，就要預備開動，等到黃燈熄減，綠色顯示的時候，停的車子開動了，行的車子停止了，等到綠燈熄滅，仍然是黃燈，黃燈後再顯紅燈，這種辦法，是使得車輛在行動方面有預備的時間，以免有來不及停，或者是來不及馬上開動的弊病。在上海我們僅有紅綠燈而沒有黃色燈夾在其中，這是已落伍了，不過警察在變幻紅綠燈的時間，吹哨子的用意，完全是代替這黃燈的作用，但是吹得不適宜，就會消失這作用，應該怎麼樣呢？應該在吹哨子的時間，絕對不可變幻紅絲燈必須吹完了，馬上由紅變綠或是由綠變紅，換一句話，就是哨子吿訴大家預備走或是預備停的信號。這吹哨子的用意，不僅要警察明白其用意，同時並須使得每一個車輛駕駛人，通通要明白他的用意，這點小小的功効，我想一般人未必能明瞭，所以我特別提出來。</p>
<p>還有一樁事是很奇怪的，人行道上的行人，越過街道的時候，應當同樣的要遵守紅綠燈的指示，要與同方向的車輛有同樣的行動，現在行人越過街這是太隨意了，照規定的辦法，歐美各大城市，很多地方，有行人指揮燈，沒有這種設備的城市，行人是遵守車輛的指揮燈，我們須要知道「交通類別」的定義中，行人亦是街道上一種交通種類，亦要併入交通規章之內的。</p>
<p>以上各節是筆者最近觀察的一個小節目，我覺得中區交通秩序的維持，問題尙多，如果能慢慢不斷的改良，必能有很好的結果，不過市政當局，如果就此認爲滿意了，這是不够的。（一民）</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎七日電〕美參議員康納利今日向和會各代表致詞稱，建議中之特里埃斯特自由區原則大綱，已得義大利政治委會三分之二委員擁護。以美國方面言，特里埃斯特協議乃一決議與協定，任何部份均不得與整個協議分離。特里埃斯特及義南邊界問題之公允解決，實爲和會關鍵。特里埃斯特自由城必須建允於民主原則上，更須自由獨立，而自由城之組織須使其能有自由的生命，不受任何列强或列強集團之外來勢力約束。唯有安理拿派定自由城行政長官爲代表，方能保證其完整與獨立，　政長官須有充分權力，得以完成此等保證。彼（行政長官）並　「若干人士所稱之獨裁者，　以彼本人或他人之意志加諸居民。行政長官鐵係負責維持該區和平安全的國際機構之工　　已」。</p>
<p>大會第一日　通過議程</p>

<h3>和會插曲　擴音器聲如號角　翻譯員心不在焉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕和會第一日，全體大會，各國代表出席並不踴躍。主席貝文之右首爲美國代表團，左首爲希臘代表團團長即內閣總理蔡爾達理斯及其他團員，其他各國僅祗有少數代表與會。在通過議程之第五項以後，擴音器突吿損壞，發聲有如號角。此外尙有一極堪發噱之事，緣有某翻譯員心不在焉，竟將蘇外次維辛斯基以英語發表之演詞，譯成俄語各國代表內之莫不大笑，維氏本人亦爲之捧腹。</p>

<h3>赫斯聲請特赦　提二項理由</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢堡六日電」英國新聞社稱：赫斯之辯護人係根據下列數點，而向盟國管制委員會聲請特赦，（一），赫斯乃各被吿中因僅犯起訴書內所列第一第二兩項罪名，即陰謀罪及破壞和平罪而被判刑之人。（二）蘇聯至少不能認德國之政策爲罪行。因蘇聯亦曾分事德國勝利之結果，如分割波蘭，貝薩拉比亞等，同時亦曾進攻芬蘭故也。</p>

<h3>北極可闢交通綫　美超空堡壘不停留試飛後證明　史巴茲將軍發表評論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅六日電〕美陸軍超空要塞夢艇號自檀香山出發，取道北極不停留飛至開羅，歷時卅九小時又卅五分鐘，安抵此間郊外機塲，全程九千五百哩，出發時載重二萬九千五百磅。機長伊兩文上校及機員九人下機時已疲乏不堪。據伊爾文談稱：此次飛行證明超空要塞可在地球上任何一部份保衛美國。北極交通可以予以開闢，儘可由技術高超者駕駛飛行，取道北極爲</p>
<p>環球飛行捷徑</p>
<p>夢舟號並無解凍設備，以便裝載較多汽油，因此不得不在四哩高之上空飛行，以免遭遇沿途氷凍氣候。高空飛行，汽汕消耗殊甚，待隆落地面，剩汽油四百加侖，僅能濕潤機上三十六只油缸缸底，各油缸裝滿時可容油一萬三千加侖。據司舵海斯少校稱：夢艇號每時速率二百五十哩，打破該機關島至華盛頓每小時二百卅四哩飛行記錄，但並未打破海軍怒　號飛機數日前創造柏斯至西雅岡之一一，二三六哩</p>
<p>不停飛行記錄</p>
<p>海斯少校領導夢艇完全依賴六磅重之電規，因飛機在密陰中飛行，上不見天，下不見地，大部份飛程，均在雲上，以免冰凍。最困難之一段在巴芬島與冰島之間，夢艇號在該處昇高至二萬二千呎，仍本完全脫離冰凍氣候云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕美陸軍超空堡壘夢艇號自夏威夷越北極飛航一六，四八〇公里而抵開羅，機長歐文上校談稱：北極</p>
<p>地磁實際地位</p>
<p>較現有北極地圖所顯示處更北三二〇公里，是與英國天文學家瓊斯爵士今日所聲稱者相同。加拿大科學家認爲北極地底或蘊藏大宗磁性物質，故在高空測騐可較爲準確。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電〕關於美國飛行家伊爾文上校駕駛「夢艇」號超空堡壘自檀香山直飛開羅，嘗試成功一事，頃由英空軍總司令</p>
<p>史巴茲將軍評</p>
<p>稱：此事足以確切證明工業國家及製造原子彈國家均在原子彈投彈襲擊之範圍以內，同時亦可知此種超空堡壘能裝載炸彈十噸，作北極飛行，而轟炸北緯四十度以北之地區。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕空軍司令史巴茲今日對超空要塞夢艇號北極飛行成功一事，發表意見謂：此舉證明設備充分之飛機可以飛越北極，並於飛行，工程，交通，氣候，汽油消費及饑力忍耐各種問題，搜集有價値之報吿。惟此舉純爲科學實騐性質，該機並無戰鬥設備。此次實騐所用之飛機比較陳舊，其他轟炸機之體積，容積飛行距離遠較此機爲大，正在打樣或已造成。此種飛機爲夢艇號及怒龜號之類，大抵可作牛球飛行，可有空餘地位裝載炸彈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕美國高級軍事專家認爲陸軍B—二九型飛越北極成功，已最後證明美國確有自北方被襲擊之可能。陸軍部方面人士力言：陸長柏德遜要求美國實施強迫軍訓之主要用意，乃在成立一人民軍隊，藉以應付自空中飛來之侵略者。</p>

<h3>滬淸查工作告峻　吳望伋臨行談感想　不在消極糾舉　重在積極運用　淸查之後應速設法淸理</h3>
<p>淸查團吳委員望伋，爲趕辦浙省淸查工作。昨晚與浙省府沈主席同車赴杭。記者於吳氏臨行時，叩詢此次在滬淸查感想，吳氏以情查團組織簡單，時間過促，未能澈底進行淸查圓滿任務，引以爲憾。且謂接收處理敵僞物資，史無前例，凌亂糟榻，勢所必然，尤以上海物資之　大與情形之複雜爲最。本人耳目所及，認爲敵人投降初期，軍事混亂中，軍民乘隙，混水摸魚，滋生弊端爲最多，惟此乃軍事過渡期中，情尙可原。至中央人員蒞滬及市政府警備司令部等，正式成立後，因滬市接收人員複雜，尙發生許多越軌非法之接收案件，或處理不當事件，實可扼腕。</p>
<p>自處理局成立後，對敵偽物資之管理始納軌範，乃該局爲臨時機構人手難免不齊，案件處理每多延擱，亦以機構龐大，弊端隨來，或因處理案件，見解不同糾紛沓至，引起許多社會反響。平心而論，處理繁複之敵偽產業，原屬難事，該局成立未滿一年，處理案件三千餘件，增加國庫收入三千億元，對事尙稱努力，至處理政策與原則，是否適當合法合理，當另一問題也。此次淸查團在消極方面，雖未能儘量糾舉接收處理之失職凟聯或舞弊營私之官史，在積極方面，使人民知這中央重視此一工作，予恃勢橫行，利用地位權力，以搶奪侵佔敵僞物資者，以嚴重之打擊。淸查團抵滬後，此輩爲非作歹之徒，已漸斂跡，至查出隱匿物資，或被佔物資而增加國庫收入，據估計當在百億元之上，收穫亦尙可觀。今日問題已不在消極之查辦舞弊，而重在積極之運用，敵遺物資，如堆存各倉庫之大量棉紗布疋與日用物品之應加速標售，以出淸倉庫，軍用器械與破舊軍用品，甚至彈壳破鐵之如何配備軍隊，或由兵工廠收用。至經濟部接收各工廠之如何加速復工，即人民無力承買工廠，政府亦應租讓或無條件由各業專營，俾早利用，恢復生產，以挽目前頹勞，而封鎖房屋及小商店與被佔據房屋財產之及早處理竣事，均爲最緊要之圖，須知淸查之後必須淸理，淸查國已將敵僞物資之弊病查出，此後爲對症下藥必須由中央主管機關設法淸理，然後可將接收處理敵僞物資之事，早吿段落也。敵僞產業處理局係臨時機構，希望地方政府與法團早日準備，俾淸理工作更見成效。</p>

<h3>加大使歐德倫將軍　暢論中國局勢　昨招待記者後當日離滬返國</h3>
<p>加拿大駐華大使歐德倫將軍，昨晨在滬舉行記者招待會，臨別贈言，對今日之中國頗多中肯之批評，歐氏早年從事新聞工作，一九四二年來華任職，對促進中加邦交及兩國貿易貢獻良多，而兩三年來精心研究我國實情，尤有成效，此次奉召返國述職，何日再度來華，至今未能決定，歐氏首先推揚中加兩國之珍貴友誼，並稱：</p>
<p>中加商約之簽訂，將視中美商約之進展情况如何而定，但渠可斷言者，中加商約一旦簽訂，其範圍必極廣泛而有意義，談及中國當前局勢，歐氏以爲徒書和平，無補實際，吾人必需眞誠相見，忠心合作，方能獲得眞正之和平，紙上簽約，固無補於和平也。但歐德倫將軍强調一點，渠以爲中國固有其弱點，但優點亦復不少，外人徒知中國之腐收，貪汚，與黑暗，但中國人乃一富有苦幹精神之民族，有奮鬥　强之耐性，渠　國後，必以三年來在中國之見聞與研究學習所得，吿諸加拿大人，使渠等明瞭中國之各種困難與問題，中國人民</p>
<p>值得欽佩者有三：一爲刻苦耐勞，一爲近年來敎育事業之進步，又一則爲中國手藝之超羣，將來可爲出口之大宗。有問以對中國民主政治之前途，作何意見？歐氏稱：中國大部人民，無論其了解民主與否，均切盼民主政治，並向此方向發展，而民主政治亦並非無任何弱點，西方民主國家，亦不免有錯誤，但有一點可以保證者，即民主國家從不發動侵略，故西方各愛自由尙民主之國家，均盼望中國早日和平，實現民主，是則對世界未來之和平，有莫大裨益。渠以爲研究中國，當從中國之領袖着手，經過三年之專心研究，渠自認對中國當代四大政黨已有認識，但拒絕作何批評，只認爲與加拿大之政黨頗相仿彿而已。有問以中國今日之情况，是否有引起第</p>
<p>三次大戰之可能，歐氏認爲無此可能，但一旦第三次大戰不幸發生，中國必居重要地位，至歐氏個人對於今日世界之和平，稍抱悲觀。最後論及加拿大之外交政策，歐氏自謙以爲加國乃一新進國家，深得英美兩國之助，余爲世界民主國家之一員，自當爲民主間努力，此次出使中國，爲欲與中國取得良好之聯繫，並加强兩國之利益，渠最後表示此在華三年，爲渠一生最有意義之時期。</p>
<p>又訊：歐德倫將軍已於昨午自滬乘機離華返加。</p>

<h3>蠶種業舉行座談會　研討改進技術減輕成本</h3>

<h3>方福樞返滬談日人刻苦狡猾堪爲我人警惕　聲色犬馬　籠絡美人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在東京國際法庭我國防部次長秦德純及僞滿愧儡皇帝薄儀作證時担任翻譯之我方法官帮辦方福樞，最近自日返國，昨與記者談及日本之近况稱：戰敗國日本之一般情形反較戰勝國之我國爲佳。</p>
<p>方氏感慨國內情形之紊亂而覺日本社會秩序之安定。據云日本目前雖尙談不上復興繁榮，但戰爭之瘡痍已漸平復，東京橫濱等各大都市被炸燼餘均已淸理掃除，市容漸復舊觀，一度凄涼冷落之銀座區域且已恢復昔日之繁華。</p>
<p>日本人民生活雖仍困苦，但不致於如上海市民之朝夕生活於物價狂跳之驚濤駭浪中。一般物資僅衣着及交通工具比較缺乏，房屋雖亦鬧荒，但絕無如上海以巨額金條出頂之現象。黑市雖存在而不猖獗。失業者雖有而心情樂觀，彼等相信由於逐漸開展之各種重建工作，不久即可有受僱之機會。一般言之，政府管制有方，人民守法服從，故國家雖敗而有希望，人民雖苦而生活安定。</p>
<p>方氏繼稱：尤堪爲我人警惕者，日本爲一刻苦狡猾之民族，善於利用機會，彼等深知此後命運操於美國之手，彼等尤深知在目前國際形勢下美國對於日本之政策，因此彼等對於美國亦愈示其曲意承志獻媚阿諛之能事。現時駐日美軍多有「樂不思蜀」之感，蓋一切舒服安適之生活，聲色犬馬之享受，日方無不儘量供給，殷勤伺候，以博得美人之好感。</p>
<p>至於國際法庭自本年五月間開始以來，自前尙在各國提供證據之階段。然後被告辯護，然後檢察官駁訴，宣判期將在明年三四月間，對於各戰犯之定　，殘暴行爲及虐待戰俘兩罪證據比較確　，惟共謀及發動侵略戰爭兩罪在法律上頗有諉卸之餘地，幸此次紐倫堡法庭上對德國戰犯判決之先例，可爲將來判罪之援引。</p>
<h3>陳納德將軍今離滬飛京</h3>
<p>飛虎將軍陳納德氏，定今晨七時半乘機離滬飛京，將晋謁　蔣主席，暨各有關當局，對航空栛會事，有所商討，聞陳氏在京，將寓勵志社，</p>
<h3>中國農業協會九日舉行年會</h3>
<p>中國農業協會定十月九日上午八時半假本市西藏路寗波同鄕會召開第八屆年會，並擬請各界人士蒞會發表對農業前途之意見，以爲參考，是日午晚由各農業機構舉行聯合公宴。</p>
<h3>宣司令覆各記者的一封信</h3>
<p>各報軍事採訪記者諸君：</p>
<p>讀諸君在本市昨報登載的信，要我答覆，我就這樣的答覆：</p>
<p>警備司令部是一個機關，不能任工作人員整天接納來賓，警備司令部是一個軍事機關，更不能不顧慮軍事的機密而盡量洩露。即以可發表的消息而言，未至發表時期，同樣有保持機密的必要，爲了這些關係，我絕對要做到會客要有一定時間，一定塲所，對外發表的新聞，不能與軍事機密相抵觸，這是我自己整飭內部的義務，也是我有權這樣做的，沒有任何理由，可以阻碍我們的任務，除非法律規定「機關應受新聞記者的支配」。</p>
<p>爲了記者不同於一般來賓，乃派定本部少將高級參謀俞墉，專司接見，分上午十時至十一時，下午三時至四時，爲接見的時間，盡量供給各記者所要的材料，若因此而謂封鎖，未免太抺殺了專實，若因此而未得充分的自由，祇有用羅蘭夫人的話答覆最爲恰當，諸君要求每處設一記者招待室，及每週由我接見半小時的工夫，我估量本部新聞產量的不多，人員配備的不够，與我個人對時間不能限定，都無此呆板規定的必要。</p>
<p>「警備部决不關起大門」，一仍其舊，進得門來，有人傳達，有人引導，有人接談，在規定會客時間，從無有人擋駕，更無以軍棍打衛兵之事，即此一點，已足說明新聞實有正確的必要，警備司令部是公家機關，發表的新聞，大都爲公務的報導，我們不能應詣君的要求，平添新鮮的事兒，若諸君以爲公務的報導不屑登載，我們無權强人之所難，但有一點請諸君注意：採訪新聞要自由，我們辦公也要自由，利己利人，才是公平的道理，我言盡於此，絕不希望有第二次的答覆。宣鐵吾</p>
<h3>市長出巡「黑市」　逾限買賣美鈔拘獲三人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上週美鈔暴漲後，各錢莊曾停止買賣三天，昨日恢復交易。當局暫規定美鈔市價爲三千五百元，若超過此限價，即加以取締。但昨日下午四時許，四川路中央路一帶，仍有人以美鈔作黑市買賣，交易甚鉅。吳市長巡視上述地點，目擊斯情，當塲致電黃浦警局，由分局長杜醇，副分局長王協恭親偕股長李蔭民率警員多名馳往逮捕，當塲拘獲猶太人律邱黃特（五十二歲，住塘山路八一八弄九十六號），國人陳希和（廿八歲，住福建路三五九弄七號），林實球（廿四歲，住元芳路元昌里廿一號），並抄襲美金票數百元，一併帶局。由杜分局長親自　審屬實，錄取口供後，論令收押，定今晨申解市警局從嚴法辦。</p>
<h3>選舉召集人別紀　預算組互讓主席　警政組拈鬮決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天市參議會各小組委員會舉行大會休會後第一次會議。因爲是第一次會議，所以開會的結果還沒有具體討論。可是在昨天最大工作選舉召集人這一幕時，却發生了二塲小風波。</p>
<p>第一件是第十組預算決算委員會選舉召集人三名。預算決算這件工作，說起來在市參議會中確是最重要的一摏，尤其是「預算」這一項。有關全上海四百萬市民的一切設施，都要由市政府用錢來做的。市政府需要多少錢？什麼事情應該化錢去做？什麼事情不需要做？那些地方應該多化錢？那些地方不應該多化錢？這種種「決策」都須由市參議會來決定。可是，市參議會要決定的事多得很，爲了一筆細賬，也沒有那末多時間來研究討論。當然這件大事要交給專門小組委員會來初步議決了。每個小組會有三位召集人，召集人顧名思義祇是召集召集大家開會而已，可是他們都是負責人，尤其首席召集人也就是委員會的主席。那末主席和負責人在一個會議中的重要性就可見一般了，若干參議員在事先到處活動競選召集人，也是「人之常情」</p>
<p>上屆預算審查與召集人是徐永祚，李文杰和何元明三位參議員。這三位參議員對於上次審查預算時所盡的力量的確値得欽佩。李文杰會計師曾經爲着審查預算撥了一夜的算盤珠沒有睡覺。</p>
<p>昨天該組選舉召集人的結果，沒有這二位經騐豐富的名會計師，不免出乎意料。其實，選舉出來有人何元明，虞舜和王乃徐三位參議員担任，也是「眾望所歸」。但當推舉何元明任主席時，何參議員不知怎的，大大的不悅於色，堅持不願担任，小小的會塲上空氣頓時緊張起來，記者們也都集中在這一個角落裏，大家你看我，我看你。議員們再三請何參議員上席，可是他無論如何也不答慮。徐參議員永祚經臨時召集人地位退到旁邊的席上，次多數的李文杰參議員雖經在座者再推升任主席，他也不願意担任，連說：「我們上次辛苦了，理應該輪班」。這樣一僵，竟僵了一刻鐘開不成會。副議長徐寄　便說「旣然選了，就應該照順序開會。」但也無結果。到了最後，有人提出：「那末虞舜先生担任了罷。」虞參議員的處境當然也很困難，當推三推四的時候，他連說：「不要客氣了，不要客氣了。」輪到他自己的時候，似乎是「勢在必行，」無可再推，所以他毅然起立說：「做就做好了。」終算把僵局打開了，草草完成第一次的會議。</p>
<p>其次要說到第六警政組的選票一個鏡頭。第六組選出第一名侯寄遠，以下應該是兩名。可是選出的姜屏落，張迺作，樊樹聲三位却有同樣的票數。正在設法解決時，姜屏瀋想起了他自己沒有選，所以他要加一票。記者們在另外一組，祗聽得這邊大聲嚷嚷，急忙　頭一看，原來張參議員迺作在發脾氣：「已經開票後怎能再選，我反對！我不贊成！我根本反對！」接着姜參議員說「我自動退出，我根本不要參加！我選舉也不是要選舉！我一定退出！」鬧了半天，秘書長，秘書都來解圍，想出個圓滿辦法拈鬮。結果是張迺作和費樹聲當選。一塲熱鬧也算風平浪靜。</p>

<h3>川島芳子型　女奸韓又傑　奴化軍民誘騙游擊隊　活躍華北二十年　昨日高院初審否認中國籍　罪惡昭彰迭任日軍職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨日下午，審訊一歷在敵方軍中担任重要工作之女漢奸嫌疑案，主角名韓又傑，現年四十一歲，原屬日本籍，名中島成子。距今十八年前，與奉天梨樹人韓景堂在北平結婚，即取得我國籍，遂以韓又傑爲名。檢察官之起訴書，指控被吿在九一八事變後，即任敵酋本莊繁參謀部囑托，及僞奉天善鄰女子中學教務長等職。七七變起，轉赴北平，在敵憲兵隊及陸軍特務機關任囑托。負聯絡僞地方治安維持會之責任，兼充敵華北方面軍寺內部下婦女宣撫班處長，藉撫慰難民俘虜之名，以奴化我軍民。嗣於敵北京兵團長山下奉文部担任招撫工作員。後升任大佐參軍，從事誘騙我遊擊部隊。旋奉山下之命，前往北滿調查蘇聯軍後，又應南京敵憲兵司令官大野，及僞河南省長邵逆文凱，招往豫魯各省引誘我遊繫部隊計達七萬餘名。去年四月，敵艦隊司令欲與定遠匪軍聯絡，被吿啣命前往工作。勝利後又與洽商接收敵人武器給養事項，以上種種有被吿在軍統局自述在華廿年活躍之手册足資佐證。故其通敵執行有關軍事職務以危害我國，自九一八後即開其端，七七後更變本加厲，無所不爲。勝利後且與奸匪勾結，圖謀不規，應予依法徵治。</p>
<p>被吿昨衣藍底小紅花旗袍，外罩黃絨線綠花外套，足穿淡黃襪，黑布鞋。長髮披肩，軋一白色髮夾。手中尙抱有手執花旗橘子年約一歲左右之小孩。被吿對審判長所詢，以帶有日語腔之國語供稱：因叔在北平日陸軍武官府做事，乃於民國十五年來中國，在北平法國敎會學校讀書。民國十七年與韓景堂結婚，父母對此甚爲反對。十人年去東北，幾經相邀，始被迫担任關東軍本莊繁參謀部之囑托，但並無薪水，亦無委任狀。僅老百姓有要求而不能去做時，乃由我代表向日軍接洽。善鄰女子中學敎務長祇做四月。</p>
<p>七七事變時，日人四次來電瀋陽相邀，被逼不過，始赴北平担任日憲兵隊及陸軍特務機關之囑托。後又担任華北方面軍寺內大將轄下之婦女宣撫班處長，皆純爲救濟難民婦孺之工作。七七事變後數月內，即已救濟五萬多人。後在北京兵團長山下奉文部下，任招撫工作員，相當大佐待遇。在河北保定，遵化，山東及長城一帶，收編流落部隊連家眷在內，共達七萬多人或予救濟，或予遣散。嗣由下奉文調往馬尼刺，又適値日軍與蘇北新四軍作戰，南京憲兵司令官大野又派我前往打聽民間情况，共散發六萬萬元救濟品予老百姓。去年四月間，日本局勢危險，奉司令官命去蘇北與新四軍接洽和平。並非聯絡企圖有所舉動。六月初一，新四軍將我扣留，指爲特務，監視八十天。迨日本投降始獲釋放，但派有一小隊人監視，送我到南京，向日本海軍武官府接洽將槍械繳出，但未成功。後因我本人及生甫六月之小孩皆生病，上海有一表哥業醫生，乃偕二衛士及一醫生來滬，擬入醫院治療。去年九月二十一日抵滬，在車站即爲漢奸警察報吿軍統局，將我逮捕，後移送高檢處。未經多問，即以漢奸嫌疑起訴。但我雖然嫁予中國人，父母並未許可。按照日本法制，與外人結婚，得父母許可後，方得准其脫難本國國籍。故我尙未入中國籍，仍是日本人檢察官又指我一向替日人做間諜工作，但我所做：都是救濟工作，帮老百姓之忙。我旣嫁了中國人，當然愛中國。且有六個孩子，家裏還有飯吃，不必要做間諜，到如今，丈夫韓景堂及孩子在東北下落不明，不知是死是活。庭上調查一過後，諭令還押，改期再訊。被吿與到庭旁廳尙留滬市之兩名日僑略談數語後，仍手抱小孩押進監獄。</p>
<h3>王金田昨日提審</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕王金田被控担任閔行敵憲兵隊密探，僞申江縣甘露鄕鄕長，魚肉鄕民案高院特提前駐閔行敵憲兵隊隊附上枝正數詢問。據稱並不識王金田。王本人則承認曾任僞鄕長，但未任敵憲兵隊密探。該案改期再訊。</p>
<h3>印警卡透新審結</h3>
<p>同日審結敵偽時期上海海防路集中營看守，虐待英僑之印警卡透新，及敵憲兵隊北四川路本部翻譯王守倫兩案，均定本月十四日上午宣判。</p>

<p>據該日人稱：德國投降以後，歐哈德局各間諜分別自動與日方合作，繼續從事諜報工作。歐哈德雖曾頒發該局解散之命令，但另於致各間諜之電報中，則聲明並不反對各人與日軍當局合作，對於日方利用該局間諜，亦從未加以阻止，至於被本人，則推稱因體弱多病，不克繼續工作，但願儘量協助云。當時德國在滬之收報電台係上海區域內最佳之電臺，經日方接收後，仍由德意兩國人員繼續工作，直至戰爭結束爲止。</p>
<p>昨日開庭時，有一意外之事，首席辯護鮑定中校突然宣稱，姚肇第律師退出辯護集團，按姚律師即爲最近代表間謀之一沈克控訴合衆社侖　爾者。</p>
<h3>「抗戰夫人」續審　薩本駒戰時有功國家　辯護律師謂情有可原</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海軍上將薩鎭冰之姪孫薩本駒，原娶陳季政爲妻室，抗戰期間薩赴內地工作，復娶同事史璧人爲妻。勝利後，陳乃向地檢處提出控訴，由檢察官以妨害婚姻罪對薩本駒及史璧人兩人起訴，此一幕「抗戰夫人」涉訟案，昨晨在地院續審。史璧人及薩本駒均到庭。薩之辯護律師提出薩曾奉委員長之命，營救英大使陸軍武官韓達中校，裘德瑞少校，及開欒煤礦總經理兼英國新聞處長華慈等至渝。於日軍進入租界時，以運布疋爲由，將以上各人裝入木箱運出日軍封鎖綫，轉赴內地，因而獲委員長之褒獎，此事雖與本案主體無關，但薩有功於國家，亦可作判決時之參攷。且薩與史之結合，實基於同事工作之感情密切之關係，况娶抗戰夫人之事，當時固盛行後方，此事實情有可原云。該案現定於本月十四再訊。</p>
<h3>新聞是那裏來的？　電話鈴一響　記者們緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕一家平平常常的二輪電影院。門前的五彩廣吿牌上雖然寫滿了誇張而刺激的字眼，可是因爲昨夜暴雨，女主角的圖照也斑剝破爛了。開映的時候快到，觀衆絡絡續續前來，人數並不很多。　突然，一個並不令人注意的流浪漢走了進來，從身邊拿出了一件黑黝黝的東西。一只手揚起，戲院裏發出了震耳欲聾的巨響，七八個人倒了下來……</p>
<p>十分鐘之後，新聞記者出現在醫院裏，警察局，出事地點閃　着攝影機上的閃光燈泡。</p>
<p>明天，在本埠新聞版上，受傷者的名單和傷勢已經一一開列出來了。</p>
<p>全上海，全中國，全世界——似乎每一隻角落裏都有新聞記者在注視着了。每天，他們用最快的速度，把一切新聞向全世界傳佈着。</p>
<p>二十世紀是一個動的世紀，新聞記者們就是紀錄這些活動的人。</p>
<p>你也許會奇怪，記者們怎麼會知道得那麼詳細呢？譬如說，那家電影院被炸的時候，明明並沒有記者在塲，何以他們在幾分鐘內就得到了消息？</p>
<p>如果全上海的電話總綫突然損壞，你就會猜出記者們的秘密來了。因爲，祇要有一天全上海的電話鈴聲不響，明天你也許就簡直會看不到一張報紙。從電報裏來的消息，實在是少得可憐的。</p>
<p>誠然，在現在的情形之下，各報館電話設備和事實的需要是差得太遠了，但是電話始終還是一切新聞最主要的來源。採訪室裏的電話是難得停止的，記者們在接電話的時候，也是五花八門，大有可觀。有說上海話的，有說廣東話的，自然國語是最普通的用語。此外，用英文的時候也不少，還有用法文的。</p>
<p>同一個人，在壞幾次電話時，會用幾種絕不相同的語氣——這一次可能是非常彬彬有禮的紳士，幾分鐘後也許就馬上會變成一個雄糾糾氣昂昂的「大亨」。新聞記者們在這一點上是和戲劇演員們有些相像的。他們常常坦白，直爽，要言不煩；但有時却又專門轉彎抹角的來外交詞令。往往在聽見最重要的消息時，訊者們的表情愈是平靜，彷彿毫不在意似的。但是他剛一放下聽筒。你就會看見他萬分緊張，有時是手不停筆的寫，有時是立刻準備出發追尋，而報館的資料室裏，也在忙着找可以配合新聞的一切參考材料了。</p>
<p>長途電話當然更見得重要。有時，剛一個電話報吿紀錄完畢，馬上就全報館動員起來，出版號外。許多人走到報館的採訪室時。常以爲記者們好像都很鬆懈，但他們實際上是準備着，他們無時無刻不等待着出動，因爲，最重要的事件，往往都是突然發生的事件。</p>
<p>一件政治性的暗殺也許會關係到全世界的大局；幾個日本兵的莽撞就是八年烽火的開端。而看到了這些偶發事件的重要性，隨時冒着性命的危險去探求眞相，然後忠實記錄下來的人，正是新聞記者。</p>
<p>無論是火一般熱的盛夏，或者冰天雪地的嚴冬，他們　時準備着動員。</p>
<p>而他們的動員令却往往就是濟朗的，堅促的，迫不及待的電話鈴聲。</p>
<h3>國貨展覽商場延期五天揭幕</h3>

<h3>配紗問題　宋院長指示方針　配價將以原始成本爲準　將請市政當局參加督導</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市紗布市況，邇來頻頻步漲，影響平民生計，殊匪江蘇鮮。國民營紗廠合組之棉紗聯會配銷委員會，亦因配價與黑市價距離見壙大，使聯合配銷工作，益見困難。生下院長爲此特於昨日下午二時許，召見紡織業管理委員會國民營紗廠各委員，計到東雲章·吳味經·李升伯·王仰先·王啓宇·榮鴻元·唐星海等多人。吳市長亦參加會談，宋院長表示：聯合配銷會第一次　　配紗經過，成績堪稱良好。惟第二次配紗，效力已不及首次之佳。最近滬市紗布價格之步漲，揆厥原因，原料價貴，紗布實銷當令，當係專賣。惟第二次配紗時，各民營紗廠，雖免有不遵聯合配銷會議定之配價配紗，亦係原因之一。故亟望聯合配銷會各構成份子，應自肅自營，勿使該一良好之機構，開存實亡。</p>
<p>原有機構暫維現狀</p>
<p>宋氏並剴切面諭：原有之聯合配銷機構，應暫維原狀，惟須積極加強及充實內容。同時，請地方政府參加協助督導，務使陽奉陰違之事，不再發生試辦聯合配紗一次。</p>
<p>統配統銷或將恢復</p>
<p>爲仍無效果，則政府勢將採取戰時陪都施主之統配統購辦法。即由政府統一搜購原料，統一分配各廠，生產成品，則由政府給予合法利潤，統一收買，然後統籌分配應用。據悉：昨日宋院長對民營各廠所提意見，均允予合理解決。例如購買外棉所需之處匯，必要時政府決設法供給。電源方面，亦正積極洽購發電機，俾便增加發電量，工人工作時間，將儘可能便恢復戰前辦法。</p>
<p>前提解決產量可增</p>
<p>各廠負責人表示：電力及工作時間兩問題，能獲得解決，則目前本市各廠每月之產紗量，可增加三分之一，即自每月產紗六萬件，增加至九萬件。至於聯合配銷之配價，宋陡升表示雖不必固定膠着於一水準，惟終望配價合理，決不能純以再生產成本爲其計算之標準，而須以原始成本爲準　云。會談前後曆一小時有餘，各委員始告辭出。</p>
<p>全面統制不許脫節</p>
<p>又消息靈通方面觀測：今後本市紗布配銷問題，自宋院長對各關係方面指示機宜後，將有全面縱斷之解決。紗布價格，自紗廠及各複製品廠，以至批發商零售商，均作相互聯銷而合理之調整，決不容其脫節及猛踴暴漲。據聞吳市長之意見，對今後本市之紗布問題，擬採取集中申請，集中分配之措施，以便簡化配銷步驟，則劃一配價。據悉：吳市長爲澈底解決紗布聯合配銷辦法計將於日內召集各紗廠及棉紗複製品各有關公會負責人，共同從祥研究云。</p>
<p>配價未動市價回小</p>
<p>紗廠聯合配銷委員會，昨日下午循例開紗。當決議：開售二十支棉紗標準數額，計民營各廠六四三件，紡建八一三·五件，均係照申請額分別酌配。售價以四百磅二十支棉紗爲標準，每件仍爲一百五十萬元。紡建昨日所開計八種，其中卅二及六十支以下，皆屬現貨，而二十支及四十支四二支三種，則係期貨，昨日紗市急轉直下，晨初開盤後，同行追於銀根，求售心切，價乃逐步下游，廿支較上週末約降十萬上下，細紗亦落十五七萬，客銷轉寂，除粵幫略有添配細紗外，漢幫殊少進取，本埠繼織廠反見吐售，亦爲銀根太緊之故。</p>
<h3>紡建門市部雙十節開幕</h3>
<p>紡建公司最近曾籌高門市部於南京西路慕爾鳴路口舊上海商店原址，今已裝修工竣，聞定雙十節開幕。</p>
<h3>美鈔交易恢復後錢兌業有行無市　警察局奉令取締黑市</h3>
<p>經營美鈔買賣之錢兌莊，昨日已恢復美鈔買賣，但以市府與央行商定之買賣美鈔三項辦法，嚴格限制，高價吸進者仍抱觀望態度，不願出手，欲按照中行規定匯率加百分之五價格購進者雖頗不乏人，終以供售者絕無僅有，致昨日美鈔交易巴陷入印度停頓準準狀態中，錢兌業喊價，始終爲三五〇〇元左右，既無收進，亦不售出，聞暗市中成交價自四二〇〇元退至四〇〇〇元左右，間有污損者三八〇〇元有成交，凡此均不普通，結果較上週六已有回跌，港票因申需報縮至一〇七元，但本市銀根　緊，是以上場雖升至九二〇元，中途回小至八六〇元，最後仍站九〇〇元關邊，結果又漲四〇元，港匯報九三〇元，印匯一一三〇元，英匯一四五〇〇元，均受港申鈔市慘跌影響，但極少成交，美匯仍乏交易做開。</p>
<p>又警察局業已奉吳市長令飭，如有在馬路上非法買賣黑市美鈔者，決依法取締井嚴辦。</p>
<p>行政院宋院長昨晨九時許，復在辦八處接見央行總裁貝祖詒，垂詢抑平美鈔有關事項。</p>
<h3>配紗轉售　昨停配者十四家　新光稱係掉換非同漁利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於新光內衣廠以配紗轉售一節，記者特往訪該廠負責人，據談如下，該廠現開布機一百七十六台，月需四十二支及四十支共約三百件左右，（廿支及內衣所需之洋綫不在內）該廠九月份向紡建請得者，爲廿三件，所差太鉅，故祇得向黑市搜購，並稱九月九日，向紡建請得之四十二支藍鳳一件，須向吳淞蘊萍浜廠內出貨，事前並須往廠派貨，經注明時日後，方能提得，但往返運費與時間，俱不合算，一而又急待需用，故當時經大態紗號章君（補進缺額紗，向經渠手）自告奮勇，願以同樣現貨掉換，並由渠出有證件，故實非轉售圖利可比，但據紡建公司澈查該案之施專員鑫泉發表經過，則稱，自紗價踴漲以來，紡建公司爲平衡市主維持工業生產起見。不得不採取緊急措置，暫以配售實用戶爲限，俾使複製工業不致影響停工，此種措置，原屬權宜之計，同時內部積極開增紡錠，增加產量，苦心維持。詎知少製廠商將配得棉紗不但不從事增產工作，反同黑市脫售，殊屬遺憾，本公司於接獲通知後，即着手調查事實，現在已告竣事，計有，新光·大市·大昌·華孚·榮新·萬順·勤裕·鴻祥·生生·榮豐·華光·同盟祥·藝華·泰昌等十四家之多，上述各廠，除停止配售外，並正由主管方面研究對策，防止再度發生。</p>
<h3>棉布平疲</h3>
<p>昨日布市，以客銷觀望不前，銀根仍緊，故交易寥寥，價亦步降，週六紡建所開之龍頭細布，晨開做八萬六千五百元，後降至八萬六千元者，市況仍趨磨疲中。</p>
<h3>收繭價格問題雙方觀點不同　絲本太高收價應提高　已逾銷價斷不宜再漲</h3>
<p>據　絲業方面透露本年秋蠶僅收得幹繭八千餘蛆，數額之少，實出意外，目前收價每担鮮繭爲十八萬元，製成幹繭折合四十八萬元，加加開支下脚等費，實需七十萬元一担，幹繭五担半　成生絲一担，緞工一次須七十萬元，幹再加三月拆自息，以二分半計算需三十萬元，總計每担生絲成本至少在四百八十萬以上，而中信局局第三批收購春繭之價格，仍規定爲每担三百八十萬元，且已收購者祇二千六百担，該公會特於上週六召開理事會議商討結果，決向主管當局要求，對收購生絲限價，略予以提高，對ABCD四級，每担各加四十萬元，以資獎廠商多製優等生絲，而利外銷，特於昨日向中信局正式提出此項建議，惟該局認爲目前收價與國外絲市價格相較，已高出二三成，不能再予提高，然名廠商威以目前絲市成本原高，如價格不迅速調整，則將不堪負担云。</p>
<h3>金價回跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍受央行管制而趨疲，晨開二一七萬有買，開後即自二一八萬起，逐步下遊，十時後央行以二一六萬價，配給二十條，此際極爲平定，盤旋而已，入後銀根更緊，斬售更股，壓力日甚，供過於求，午刻退到二一四萬光景，始稍見定，午後隔日交割形勢趨穩，最後升至二一六萬五左右，結果較上週六回跌三萬，飾金降至念三萬，紋銀未更，銀元昂至二〇〇〇元外，喑拆銀根更緊，暗息自二角六至二角不等。</p>
<h3>多頭出籠公債軋跌</h3>
<p>公積昨銀根緊迫萬分，樓某大戶斬多三百餘萬元，統丙最開二六〇〇元之價，即告不支而退，逐步下降，中途雖有盤旋，大勢助賣，無法振作，近午曾盤跌至一八七〇元以下，始得轉平，午刻回升至一九五〇元結束，結果較上週六跌落六五〇元之鉅，甲乙軋升五〇元，統丁升一〇〇元，統戊尚平。</p>
<h3>南洋綫貨運清淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南洋綫自海關宣布禁止棉紗棉布輪閩粵二省後，各輪貨清淡，昨日增德輪駛粵，兼　廈門，運粵僅土布二百二十件，豆餅一千塊，香烟八百七十箱，什貨藥材約二千一百件，運廈門有麩皮一萬一千餘包，麥子一千二百包，豆餅四千一百七十塊，豆子八百八十包，什貨一千七百餘件。又海關輪運油頭，豆子四百餘包，芝麻一百三十餘包，豆餅二千七百餘包，麩皮一千六百七十包，花生餅六百七十五塊，肥田粉三百包，什貨二千餘包。</p>
<h3>不景氣高爾夫襲來歟　英美經濟學家預測</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕據此倘經濟學家稱：觀察最近形勢，在一九四七年後期或一九四八年前期，美國商業將有不景氣之趨勢，但其情形不至嚴重，而且曆時不長。全國設計協會經濟專家赫根謂目前存貨日漸增加，乃供應已漸籠適應需求之微象。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕近來白煤市價飛漲，殆由於瞬屆冬令，持貨者鑒於白煤到滬稀少，居奇扳抬。但市價雖高，極少成交。日昨燃管會主委徐樂天接見記者透露：自本會進行採運白煤，供應本市冬令需用後，茲據確息，越南鴻基大塊一批一千八百餘噸業已抵滬。並將繼續裝來，美洲白煤，亦洽裝燃管會復向記者表示：白煤塊僅爲酒菜館等及優裕家庭冬令取暖之用，用途狹隘。市價之消長，影響民生猶淺。民生日用燃料所需白煤屑，該會早已大量供應。故煤球市價穩定已久，希望一般白煤塊用戶，毋事高價搜購。不久該會大量白煤到滬，平價出售時將自招損失云。</p>
<p>行政院長宋子文，昨召見燃料管理委員會主任委員徐樂天，公用局長趙曾鈺兩氏，對本市燃料管制情形，及煤斤到貨數量，供應狀況，詳加垂詢，並舉行會談，據稱關於燃料管制問題，市參議會會以管制燃料之結果，予工商業及一般市民以重大影響，一致通過要求政府撤銷燃料統制，由商人自行採辦，宋氏召見徐趙兩氏，對此特加檢討，俾決定燃料管制是否需要繼續，抑或撤銷。</p>
<h3>白煤又見高價</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊散多手上之貨，業已絡續售完，故市上白煤塊又呈短少現象，抬價之風又盛，各貨均見新高價，白煤屑因本月份起燃委會限制各煤球廠申購原料煤，而各煤球廠現時正值煤球暢銷展開之期，故不敷原料，祇能向煤業市場搜購是以市價突見上升</p>
<h3>銀根緊傳說多　股市大受影響</h3>
<p>華股昨受銀根大緊影響，上場即普遍告跌，開後由低急回，但各股漲高後仍遭存多了結而不支，十時二十分起，形勢漸定，廣幫與北幫有進，又漸回上，十時三十五分，證券幫某大戶來進永紗及美亞頗鉅，廣幫亦納永紗，再告盤好。惟十一時左右，仍然在漸斬多情況下不支而退，疲態延至十一時二十分，川幫大進，散多及　面　助威，各股急切回升，永紗漲達八百元在關，美亞四四五〇元，兩大勢之外，僅信和現高挺，餘者仍不見振作，仍舊附庸而已。十一時三十分後，高價經獲利多方供售後，漸告回落。近午晨初力進之某證券大戶，及北幫均售，加之傳聞商業銀行存款，有　　之謠，人心更怯，多頭斬殺不已，永紗竟跌至七六九元低價，美亞曾迫近晨初四二三〇元低價而後暫止，臨收經散戶及空方獲利補進，稍稍拉上，結果較上週六計永紗景福新光勤興各跌半成，美亞小十分之三，信和降半成弱，中紡統盆火柴亞麗婁內衣水泥景緰各跌半成強，中絲獨平，五和公司微挫，大通華豐跌一成左右，總成交額爲一一四〇萬股，場外各股，稍有挫落。處股亦告回低，除業廣外，各股都稍告不振，結果較上週六計怡紗英聯各跌半成，紙業航業銅業曾德豐怡啤雖跌而不多，業廣稍有軋升。</p>
<h3>人造絲穩定　昨仍做週六原盤</h3>
<p>昨日絲市頗呈鎮定，一二〇號人造絲天橋有光仍做上週六原盤，爲三百七十萬元，雜牌相差五萬至十萬元，半光做三十五萬至四十萬元，一五〇號有光與一二〇號半光價相仿，一五〇號及七五號半光均喊二百八九十萬元，廠經亦甚穩定，昨喊價比上週末略疲，但成交殊鮮，因市上現貨甚穩，絲號家俱巨恐脫手後不易補進，以致未見做開，據該業中人云，目前業外人執貨極微，故無投機作用，市價不致波動，睡綢市續形疲軟，盛杭各貨，俱各見跌。</p>
<h3>處幣抵付進口貨價　中央銀行重申禁令</h3>
<p>關於進口貨值，不得以外幣抵付一節，中央銀行頃以第五八號通告知照各指定外匯銀行，重申前令，如次：中央銀行曾於六月十五日以四五號通告，知照各指定經營我匯銀行，不得收受外幣，以抵償某種進口貨值及其他需用，頃據確實調查，日來商人在公開市場收買外幣，予以協助，警告曾向各該行購買外幣匯之商人，嗣後不得收受外幣償付貨款，並不得購買外幣，凡經查實違反是項禁令者，一概不准參加任何外匯交易。</p>
<h3>米市來源不斷　粳秈均已回小　糧審會決維持原價</h3>
<p>米市來源尚可，客貨登記總達一萬三千餘石，市情早堅午疲，結果粳秈米均軋小千元，惟白元則貨稀消活，價升二三千元，台米續配七百包，價格照舊，小麥今日未有成交，麵粉因當局監視頗嚴，境內無成交，麩皮本鄉及浙路甚活，再升三五百元，黃豆來遊以運輸不快到消尚可，高料菜坯去化甚活，價漲三五百元，緑豆相仿，芝麻平平，紅糧止漲軋跌，回小千元，缸豆初見，生仁猛跌之後，零化　動，店方揀巧拾取，回升地二三千元。新貨加六七千元，苟米小五六百元，油市配貨尚多，豆油平定，菜油不千元，生油盡挫一二千元。</p>
<p>又訊，據悉：江蘇省王主席已赴鎮江·蘇州一帶，採取嚴格管制，該地米價已見回復，今日（八日）舉行之糧審會，據糧食課吉課長表示，「決定仍維持原價」云。</p>

<p>自B.O.P嘜台湾細紅茶，至存久缺以來，土莊製茶廠即行仿製，聞刻下買戶已在驗看中，對於出口尚爲滿意，惜給價異常慳吝，致交易一時尚難展開，至於上週裕隆洋行與盆隆茶棧一度談判之陳特貢，陳溫紅，則已獲得圓滿解決，共計成交二百餘箱，茲據業中人云，白頭行對上項花色，尚有胃納云。</p>

<h3>教部一孫二督學報告臺省教育狀況　學生行動態度已日本化</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕合灣省重歸祖國後，敎部對該省敎育極爲重視，特派督學王培仁，孫夏棠二氏，前往視察，現已視察完畢，返部報吿台省敎育狀况及其優點。茲探誌其視察報吿中要點如下：</p>
<p>百兒童有八十二個入學</p>
<p>台灣自去年十一月間接收後，努力普及國語，宣揚三民主義，提倡中國因有之道德精神。對於日本敎育遺毒之掃除，亦知努力，以期符合中國學制與法令，而達到「中國化」。今各級學校，大致已調整完畢，現有省屬敎育機關，計師範，法商學院各一，工專，農專各一，師範學校四所，中學三八校，工職四校，農職九校，商職七校，水產二校，省　國民學校八校，又省立民敎館三所，圖書館一所，鄕土館一所，國語推行委員會一處，語文補習學校一校，國語推行所十一所，工業技術及補習所校共十所，盲啞學校二所，以上計省屬高等敎育機關四，中等敎育機關六九，國民學校八，社敎機關三。至縣市及私立敎育機關，計縣市立中學七五，職業學校四四，私立中學九，私立職校一〇，國民學校一·〇三一，該省根據日本文敎局之統計，入學兒童佔學齡兒童百分之八二·七五，至各縣市社敎機關正在籌設，已成立民敎館者，僅有台南一縣，惟各縣市圖盡館甚爲普遍，計縣立者八市立者　，公立者八三，私立者三。</p>
<p>教育費佔預算百分之卅</p>
<p>各級學校校舍及設備，均較內地爲佳，即鄉間之國民學校校舍，亦多荘皇富豐，惟在戰時，或久未修理，或被炸毀，破損塌毀者，亦所在都是。各地學生以久受日人之敎育，多儉樸而有禮貌，一切行動態度已日本化，整齊嚴爾則有餘，但活潑自發則嫌不足。各地敎師服務精神極佳，雖有三四個月之內僅發少數維持費者，然仍每日按時到校授課。惟各校教師，光復前多爲日人，光復後雖有內地敎師來此，然爲數無多，大部敎師爲台胞充任，以在日本統治時期，限制台胞受師範敎育，是以現在師資不合格者甚夥，如各地國民學校敎師，每校師範畢業者，不過三五人而已。關於敎育經費方面，據該省長官公署敎育處，卅五年四至十二月份經臨費收支預算書，其收入部門爲學費，共計台幣一·七四〇·〇〇〇元，經常搜支出爲臺幣六六·六〇五·四三一元，臨時費台幣一〇三·〇三六·〇一〇元，各縣市敎育經費平均佔預算百分三十左右。</p>
<p>父兄會對學校助力甚大</p>
<p>王孫二督學視察後，認爲台省敎育之優點可得而于述者，約有數點：（一）該省對於中小學教師訓練，與講習，頗知注意，省及縣市行政當局均能努力推行。（二）該省與縣市級敎育工作人員之待遇，其計算方法相同，且與各部門之公務員相同，待遇公允，上下無怨言。（三）得級學校敎師，每日多能按時到校，按時返家，服務精神可嘉。（四）各級學校校舍，均堂皇壯麗，設備亦佳，有若干學，校，其規模及設備爲國內所無（五）學生多甚樸素，而能守紀律，亦知禮貌。（六）各地員生對於國語之學習，頗爲努力。（七）該省各地職業敎育，甚爲發達，一切設施情形，亦較內地良好。（八）各地公私之圖書館林立，便於學生及民衆閱讀。（九）士紳及學生家長，對於所在地之學校，有父兄會之組織，對於學校助力甚大。</p>
<h3>市小徵求尊師金　昨發表宣言聲明</h3>
<p>本市市立小學敎職員聯誼會，對於征收尊師金問題，有所聲明，昨特發表宣言，大意如下：自從勝利到現在，我們對於　　待遇之呼薇，已經力竭聲斯，可是國家社會所給與我們的答覆，只是口頭的同情，和杯水車薪的小惠。我們體念到，主席「敎育第一」的口號，不禁仰天噓氣，俛首呑聲！本學期市敎育局體念到我們淸苦，而又無調整生活費的職權，因此延用上學期之尊師名義，命令各校微收尊師金。此種辦法、在我們本身實感到捨本逐末，無補於事，初非太會同人累次呼籲的眞正意旨。不過爲了市敎育當局委曲求全的誠意計，本會同人待斃洞轍的急迫，所以先行遵令徵收，以濟燃眉。至於合理調整待遇的請求，非但不因此中止，並且要達到在最短期內成功的目的。我們謹正吿全市父老昆弟，諸姑姊妹，我們徵收尊師金，是救急的治標辦法，希望這一次是最後的一次，希望合理的治本的待遇，即行調整，使我們得安心服務，更希望各界賢達，惠予援助，使我們的願望，得早日實現，則敎育幸甚！同人幸甚！</p>

<p>（羣聲）林珠光（領隊）襲東昇（管理）王功扁（幹事）陳金德（隊長）陳金置，蔡文華，蔡文章，蔡連科，楊人輝，李天祥，陳德秀，莊淸華，張毓義，朱世榮，蔡德明。</p>

<h3>羣聲明晨晋京</h3>

<p>本季甲組球隊，多數遭遇自來未有之困難，不易成軍者，比比皆是，考其原因，釣有三端，老將逐漸退休，繼起乏人，一部分球負，變更服務地域，各球隊之贊助人，支持乏力。渠於此時被推爲主席，深感任重而道遠，將斥其心力之所及，與諸委員共負艱鉅，委員會決於報名截止後，發函徵詢各隊意見，希望各隊能本和諧合作之精神，發抒善意之建議，使球隊與今後聯賽，兩有裨益。戰後本市足球最大之危機，在學校聯賽之迄未恢復，致無新人產生，學校體育無聲氣，則社會體育必晚節，故社會體育以學校體育爲出發點。</p>

<h3>台茶在萎縮狀態中</h3>
<p>— 十八日臺灣航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣的特產品，現在一毅的　呈現着產銷萎縮狀態。人們愛追憶從前日本統治時代的數字，例如民國二十九年的　品　　輪入數字是四〇八·六五〇（單位千園），輸出是五九二　　三九·而聞名的合茶，其輸出佔總額百分之三·六，三十二年的輸出金額是二二·六五二元（單從千元），僅次於米和糖，這是說明了本省貿易的黃金時期，也說明了茶葉在整個輸出中所佔的地位。</p>
<p>可是光復以後到現在的一年間，茶葉可以說完全陷於停頓，沒有產也沒有銷，最近英·美·蘇聯先後洽購陳茶十萬磅，一般認爲台茶已重獲國際市塲，但識者却認爲不從基本上着手，還是難望於永恒的保持正常的國際貿易。現階段是茶葉生機的開始，但也正是憂鬱的畢端。</p>
<p>官營民營　力量均甚雄厚</p>
<p>台茶主要的品種有包種茶，烏龍茶，紅茶三種，磚茶只是銷售蘇聯的副產品，綠茶也有幾種，因爲它與日本本土秧値的相尅，所以在天時地理都適合的台灣，過去是側重純紅茶的栽値和採擷。</p>
<p>日本人在這裏企圖獨佔的茶業機構，如三井，特本，東橫，三莊，台農，各株式會社，及東野，成岡商店，野澤組台北出張所等八個單位，擁有茶園面積三千一百四十五甲，（合國內四萬八千餘畝），統被農林處接收。另外還有兩個試騐塲，一個茶業傳習所。被接收的八個單位，由政府合併屬於臺灣省茶葉公司，現在他們有三個精製工廠，其中之一沒有開工，粗製工廠十四家，有十家開工，四家因爲機器損壞的關係還停着工。停辦了三四年的茶業傳習所，據主管茶葉科的負責人稱：準備於本年十月間招生，一年一期，訓練茶業新幹部，有二十餘甲的茶園，和一個實習工廠，專供學員們實習，現在也正在趕修中。民營的茶葉，即在過去也具有很大的力量，他們有同業公會，也有企業性的茶葉公司，主要是避免洋行，中間商人的操縱和採取；而通過全省茶業者的組織，本年二月他們將台茶輸出株式會社，台灣包裝容器製造株式會社，台灣磚茶株式會社合併，並收買了興南，鵬南兩公司的全部股份。該公司有全省獨有的磚茶機械，也有熟練的工人，戰前有百餘家，現在則有七十餘家茶商，擁有茶園三萬七千六百五十三甲，（合國內十八萬畝，）粗製茶工廠二百十三所，精製茶工廠八十所。</p>
<p>官民雙方給台茶奠下了國際貿易的基礎，一直到戰後，因爲海上交通關係，輸出蒙受影響，而產量大减。去年和今年，茶業的蕭條景像，實在是不堪回首！</p>
<p>茶商茶農蒙受莫大痛苦</p>
<p>臺灣有過「香料王國」的榮譽。有大量出產的樟腦和芳油，也有茉莉，黃枝，秀英等香料作物，用於茶業的大量間植。日本人對於茶業的獎勵是機器補助，配給肥料，改良品種，並設立講習所。對山地的茶園並成立品評會，在技術方面求改進。特別重要的，是以百分之九十五的烏龍茶銷售英美，在他們的茶店裏，每年化有二十到三十萬元的宣傳費。同時對銷售第三國的獎金，也有六百萬的數目。民國二十七，二十八年間，外銷有一千多萬斤時，每斤的補助費是七元，而稅收予以豁免。日本人的政策，在鼓勵台茶外銷上是收有成效的。</p>
<p>茶業公會會長王添燈和林潮明沉痛地對記者說：本省原可年產茶二千萬斤，本省消費量是一百萬斤，近來一落千丈，只有四百萬斤；臺北縣和新竹縣的茶農，荒疎了八十餘年種茶的習慣（臺茶與英美貿易始於一九〇九年）。因爲受戰時的影響，茶山都吿荒蕪。僅台北一處，直接間接失業者已有三萬人。他曾再三向政府請求獎勵，取消茶園所征的捐稅，在運輸和種植上多想辦法，還沒得到具體的結果。接着他抱着悲觀的態度說：「農民沒辦法繳納稅款，茶園的荒蕪，是一時無法挽回的了！」記者並參觀了昔時有名的大稻埕工廠，只有幾個工人在停頓的機器旁揀選陳茶，景象　　異常。現在他們正着手組織以台茶栽培，製造，貿易的統一機構，成立官民合辦的茶業公司，開拓世界市塲，並設立評價，指導，生產資材購運委員會，資本幣一億元，相信由於政府和民間的切實合作，是有利於台茶的發展的。</p>

<h3>災魔侵襲贛農村</h3>
<p>— 九月十八日航訊　本報駐南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>江西的災難，眞是說不盡的苦，寫不了的慘，這受過八年的匪患，又加上八年的戰災，老俵們落在外鄉，戰後歸來，自己的房舍，被敵人燒光，沒房住，大家擠在又臭又髒的厠所裏或破爛的屋簷下，避風雨，貧衣食。靑黃不接的季節，老百姓毅倉裏玉黃色的榖粒，爲了繳付軍糧，掃數無存，肚子餓得沒辦法，吃觀音土，啃樹皮，這些慘痛的實情，想讀者都已老熟能詳了。</p>
<p>假如在一張染色的贛災地圖上看，贛東南的災情，雖不如西北地區的嚴重，但是，目前亦有較嚴厲的災魔侵製慘破的農村。</p>
<p>南城，是贛東南的一個軍略據點，同時亦是贛浙贛閩的交通必經之地，那兒的房舍，遭遇敵人的破壞，據縣政府最近的調查報吿，共計五千餘棟，約佔全城原有房屋百分之九十。榮歸的老俵們，沒辦法，祇好在瓦礫的廢墟上，沒人的野草裏，利用破瓦殘磚搭蓋廬舍以棲身，刧後的南城，復遇到鼠疫的侵襲，傷害了多少貧苦人們的生命。</p>
<p>贛南農村的虫害，牛瘟，因爲農民的知識低落與醫藥設備的不够，今年贛南各地農民雖是望着豐收，但是，不幸遭到這樣意外的災害。</p>
<p>吉安的破壞，是勝利前夕敵人在中國戰塲最後一次的流竄戰所造成，當時敵人明知要遭到毀滅性的慘敗，所以，經過地區的人們，都受到鬼子們無人性的燒殺破壞，因此，吉安五千五百棟的房子被焚燬，二千四百頭耕牛被損害。</p>
<p>贛西北地區，是江西遭受敵軍蹂躪最久的一角。模跨錦江的高安縣城，完全被毀，野草垃圾，庵沒了原有的街道。奉新，德安，上高……整個農村歸於毀滅，祇剩了幾棟沒門缺戶的冲天破房，寫下了鬼子在江西暴行的慘史。</p>
<p>江西災害的嚴重，肌餓綫上人的們，現階段的善後救濟，近幾天來，我們曾經訪問災區，亦曾親近社會人土，聽取一般的　吿，覺得江西的善救工作，雖蓋尙未達到理想，但是，確有一些事實的表現，可以看到他們的努力。</p>
<p>譬如：第一期的農村緊急救濟，在南昌，新建，永修等縣，協助農民復耕，使得雙手空拳的義胞，流落歸來，有農舍住，有耕牛，農具助耕，開闢了多年的荒田，使得今年解決了一部份糧食問題。</p>
<p>一萬萬元的水利專款，修復了南，新，永三縣年久失修的贛江大堤與各段圩閘共計完成二八二處決口，一八九處臉段，一〇〇座涵閘，受益的田畝共達七六五，五二〇畝，現在並且會同揚子江水利委員會江西區堵口復堤工程處合作，以工賑方式加强修復贛江及濱湖圩堤，根據工程處的培，報吿修的圩堤，有二處七，一三，三二一，〇五〇公尺長度，二，三六五，三五〇公方土方，受益田畝三，四五九，六二〇市畝。</p>
<p>今年的贛江，洪水幾度暴漲，水位的最高點，距離堤面，僅差數英寸，各段河堤確保無恙，這是對於江西今年豐收的一個大帮助，農村眞的獲得了救濟的實惠。</p>
<p>目下的救濟，着重在農村，今後的善後，還是在農村。因爲貧民的大衆是在都市以外的一個角落裏，那兒的人們正伸出着需要救濟的手。蔡孟堅署長談到江西今後的救濟業務。說：『江西善救工作的實際推動者是工作隊，分署各組室，不過是此一工作的「司令台」。現在工作隊的業務，就目前最迫切需要者，可分爲六項：（一）農業救濟，（二）緊急救濟，（三）社會福利，（四）衛生，（五）防洪防旱，（六）建築各種公共建築物。蔡氏並强調江西農田拋荒的嚴重，應該加强開墾復耕，增加生產，所以分署現在決定在荒地最多的永修縣屬張公渡一帶，創辦示範農塲，已經測量荒地面積，第一期開發五千畝，第二期擴展到一萬畝，將來可能利用聯總的新一式農具，從事此一拓荒工作。</p>
<p>目前主持江西善後救濟工作者，遭遇到幾種難以克復的困難：一，救濟物資太少：行總原先準備配發給江西的物資，每月爲一萬五千噸，但是，自去年十一月到現在止，運到九江的物資，爲一萬噸，不足原預算的十分之一。</p>
<p>二，運輸困難：江西現在交通工具的貧乏，真困難到極點，盡量利用水陸交通工具，每月的運輪量，亦祇有五千噸，何況不通舟車的農村，必需利用人力的挑運！</p>
<p>三，經費減少：行總核準撥交江西的經費，原先是每月七億元，現在因爲行總本身經費困難，自八月份起，江西分署的經費，核減爲四億元。如每月以一萬噸的物資運費，需要五億元的運費，將每月全部的經費——四億元，亦不足一萬噸的物資運費，怎能談到善後的建設。</p>
<p>所以，江西的父老，一致的盼望，行總能多配給一點適用的物資，解除目前農村的貧苦與二百萬亟待救濟的人們的生活。</p>

<h3>颱風災區</h3>
<p>阿里山行中途作罷</p>
<p>記者於廿四日抵達台灣中部的嘉義，旋即赴台南縣政府所在地—新營，記者在這個小鎭上逗留了一宵，而在廿五日下午二時返嘉義市前，恰已黃沙幾天，使人睜不開眼，滿以爲南部例有的灰沙，可是返抵市區時、無綫電已發出了緊急警報：「颱風襲台！」</p>
<p>颱風在廿四日已離本島二百公里的洋面上發現，對於這樣的特產，本省人是習慣了的，可是却想不到竟以每秒三十五公尺的風遠，自台東及南部尖端恒春登陸，帶給省人以莫大的恐怖。</p>
<p>在廿五日早晨，風雨交作，記者們蹲在一個剛蓋好不久的旅社裏，對面柳子林下的木屋被吹倒了，頎長的身軀也折着腰，樓頭在搖擺着，窗外的雨點，任憑你木窗緊閉到怎樣的程度，還是滴落的向室內飄，猛力地打着。記者在這危樓想起了台北的家，妻和孩子們怕正擁抱着在想念南行的丈夫罷！</p>
<p>雨在一時間停了，風也暫時靜止了下來，我們準備趕預定的路程，作阿里山森林區行。我們到了台拓公司的車站，驀然間雨又來了，風速較先前更烈更猛，我們沒有减縮上山的勇氣，仍搭着特備的汽油車冒風向前進，雨點打在面頰上像是一塊塊的冰疤；風，從海面上吹來的風像席捲似的曳動着汽油車，司機拚着命在注意煞車，我們全身淋濕了，我們不再相信兩站以上沒有風險的話，我們折回了。據站長的報吿，這實是冒險的旅行，不整齊的石塊，已從山上倒下來阻礙了車輛行前，人常易在這情景下活活地犧牲，氣象局的報吿是：『強烈颱風九五五(M·B·）七一六（W·M·）今日下午二時在北緯一九度五，東經一三一度五，即在琉球南東一千公里海上向北西進展，接近琉球，中心移動速度每時廿五公里！』</p>
<p>緊急措置</p>
<p>記者首先訪問了中華日報社長慮冠羣，杯水車薪，他很凄然地說：颱風將報社的屋頂吹去了颱風災區，社長室，編輯部水深沒脛，可以劃船；沒有電，兩天不出報紙了，他焦念得發昏，他說中華日報才是多災多難，但他仍鼓起所有的勇氣，終於廿八日復刋了，光是修理費就需要台幣二十多萬，爲了報社，他幾乎自刮風起就沒睡過覺。</p>
<p>台南市長卓高煊在颱風停後的一小時發出了緊急通吿，傷者免費送醫院，死者報吿撫恤，無家可歸者送救濟院，一時間他獲得了幾個數字，死者四人，市區中南部國民學校被毀，一般作物損失在五成以下。縣境七股區鹽民被浪潮捲去廿五人，失踪者不明，鄉成功之母養老的開元寺，有二百餘年歷史的古樹被風砍斷。祇七股一區，損失在四萬萬元以上。</p>
<p>南部高雄市區，港務局撈起的船隻被浪濤冲激入海，漏夜趕撈，始濟於事，工廠，學校，民房被毀的在二千萬元以上。縣區的蔗田，烟苗蕃薯統被毀了，蔗田祗可以保存秧籽，四五萬畝的稻作損害四成以上，不過自然所賜予的蝗災被撲滅了，自然克服了自然，人類在這裏顯得渺小的，脆弱的。</p>
<p>台南氣象臺長說，這是三十五年來中南部所未有的災難，可是北部東部却正是一樣，陳長官應付緊急，撥款千五百萬臺幣，但這是太微薄的；不過由於颱風的襲擊，給予人力試騐的絕妙機會，南北交通廿四小時內恢復了，電燈總綫壞了，配電所也壞了，但在二天內也全部放了光明，電話，電報，九道齊復正常了，只有人爲的米價（自十三元一斤漲到十七元）和建築材料（瓦片自四角漲至一元三角）的飛漲，需要各單位統一作有計劃的平抑。</p>
<p>繼颱風之後，另一特產又發生了波動：廿八日晨四時許七時半，兩次較大的地震，所幸並無傷害；海島，自然給予它莫大的厄難！</p>

<h3>論華僑商業之勢力與改進（上）</h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>一　小引</p>
<p>華僑旅居國外，以從事經濟事業爲主，而商業爲經濟事業主要之一環。以言商業，可分三層言之：（一）進出口業項（頭）盤(批發）賣買商，華僑並不多；（二）都市二盤（仲介）商，則華僑經營者衆；（三）鄕鎭（三盤）零售零購商，華僑經營者尤夥。華僑商業之勢力，幾全在仲介買賣商與零售零購商方面，一言以蔽之，華僑商業幾盡居於中間性之中介人地位。蓋以歐美及日本爲工業國家，中國大體上至多爲百分之五十工業五十農業的國家，兩洋一帶則爲晨業之社會。歐·美僑民祗願以其資本經營進出口上層大商業，以收穫最大之利益，而不願零零星星，費時費事，去做小買賣，以逐毫毛之利。日僑與當地人民間，則又不無隔膜，雖第一次大戰後，日本强盛。妄以東南亞救主自居，而日僑與南洋本地人民允力求好感，各地確曾寄日本以希望，但經二次大戰，日本竟暴露其欺騙面目，則日本戰敗以後，日僑自難恢復其地位。當地人民之知識與能力，則均感弗及華僑。故歐·美與戰後日本，對南洋貿易，授受之間，恐仍須借重華僑爲中間人。然亦惟其如此，華僑商業今後在南洋一帶，勢必倍受當地土著人民之歧視與競爭。蓄在彼輩視之，往往有華僑阻止其經濟發展之錯覺也。此觀於菲列賓及荷印最近之情况，即可</p>
<p>華僑在南洋商業之關係，旣爲中間性之關係，而華僑人衆手多，華僑商業即在此中間性上發榮滋長。上海聖約翰大學敎授麥克勒在其所著「華僑之地位與保護」中稱：「華僑之經濟的地位極有勢力，以菲島稅收額爲基礎作成之統計，菲島零售業之九成在華僑手中，批發商之大部份亦受華僑之支配。歐美商人，如無華僑之中介，幾無法與本土人民交易，結果不得不求助於華僑。從事椰子·烟草·米·蔴·砂糖·酒類·椰乾·木材·戰什貨商之華僑，頗多積成巨富者。」旨哉斯言，不特菲島華僑如是，其他暹·越·緬·馬·荷印等地華僑，亦莫不皆然。但今後華僑如何可以保持其地位，即大費硏究矣。茲將南洋各國華僑商業情形略述於後：</p>
<p>二　南洋各國華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>（1）菲列賓華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>據菲島農商部於一九三二年華僑投資經濟事業最興盛時期與外僑投資之比較統計，報吿如下：(單位：菲幣千比索）</p>
<p>更據菲島政府一九三八年戶口調查統計，華僑與各國人民經營零售商之比較如下：</p>
<p>觀於前表，可知菲島華僑操零售業者之間數與資本數，固均居菲島本國人之後，佔第二位，而總收入則居第一位，佔百分之五十八，菲本島人佔百分之三十八，日僑佔百分之二·六五，至美·西·印僑等經營零售業者，則爲數不多。有位外國作家海登R．Hay—den對華僑在菲之經濟勢力，謂『菲列賓之華僑，百分之七十至八十業零售，各大島之商業信用四分之三均操在華僑手中。在外島經營零售木材百分之四十，爲由華僑供給。其投資總額，據估計達一百億美元，竟等於美國對華投資之牛。」海氏所謂華僑在菲投資達一百億美元，固不免過於强調，然可見華僑在菲商業勢力之大。</p>
<p>（2）暹羅華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>暹羅京都曼谷，廣東(尤其潮州瓊州）僑民多於福建僑民，內地則閩漳泉僑，多於粤潮瓊僑，共約三百萬人。暹羅華僑主要職業爲商，尤其零售商，多數之小販商，常深入荒山深谷，與本地人民交易。運米與磨米，多由華僑担任。所經營之工業與家庭手工業，有機器·碾米·鋸木·造船·紡織·電器·榨油·火柴·烟草·化學工業·成衣·木匠·馬革·鐵匠·錫匠·與鑛塲·膠園與礦工，園丁亦至多。暹羅之出口，以米，柚木·錫·樹膠四者爲大宗，此四者無異爲暹羅之四寶，而米尤占首要之地位。暹一年耕有二年之食，每年出口二千五百萬至三千萬公担，占輸出總額百分之七十，便値九千五百萬銖至一億銖開。佛曆二九八二年(一九三九）輸出三千一百二十五萬公担（一，八二五，〇二七噸。）一九四〇年上十個月輸出一百五十九萬六千九百七十三噸，價値一億一千四百三十五萬銖。錫居主要產品之第二位，年產一十六萬至廿六萬公担，價値一千七百萬至三千萬銖。一九三八年輸出達三千四百零三萬銖。戰前六個月倫敦平均每噸價格二百三十七鎊，一九四〇年每噸增至二百四十三鎊，故邊羅是年上七個月錫出口總値達二千六百三萬銖。樹膠僅有二三十年歷史，多種邊南部，一九三九年底，暹羅計有大樹膠園八十五單位，共有三萬萊（暹畝）。此外尙有許多小樹膠園，合計有三十一萬二千萊。一九三八年產四萬餘噸，輸出總値三千五百一十二萬銖。柚木每年輸出總値在一千萬銖。</p>
<p>據一九三〇年之調查，華僑米商一百四十一家，進出口商八十四家，保臉公司一十家，木材商二十家，機器商二十一家，木器商十八家，什貨商一三三五家，堪稱極盛。惟自一九三二年暹羅政變後，實施所謂經濟新政策，尤其自一九三九年軍閥政府高唱「唯國主義」後，實施排華政策，先後頒布排華苛例廿餘種，諸如華店須用暹人百分之七十五爲店員，三輪車。理髮等職業祗限暹人經營，一般零售商亦漸次由暹人經營等等。當時暹政府更聽從日顧問三原新三之計劃，於一九四〇年發行合作事業公債，募得一千八百萬銖，推行各種合作事業，至一九四一年上半年共達二千六百三十九單位，一九四三年暹政府設立工業部，所有造紙·洋灰·釀酒·烟草·火柴·糖·皮革等原有工業，已見擴充，同時向所缺乏化學藥品，亦相繼設立試騐所與工廠等，而在邊華僑整個商業與整個經濟遂步人惡運。暹羅於一九四二年受日脅從，與盟國宣戰。但自一九四六年一月十一日暹境內日軍正式舉行投降儀式，暹羅唯國主義亦已取消。同年同月廿三日中暹友好條約成立後，邊總理於二月七日接見中央社記者稱：『兩國人民如此酷似，幾若不可分者。君若詢街上任何暹人，彼必可吿君，彼之祖父或曾祖父爲中國人，彼何能對堂兄弟之華僑生厭惡之感？如美國及其他國家，均易劃華僑區，但暹羅之華僑可隨處居住，自由與暹人相處。余信兩國商業關係必將大爲增強，蓋以華僑商人佔全暹商人數百分之八十也。」麥克勒敎授謂：「凡曾觀察暹羅之生活者，皆知暹羅今日國勢之盛，胥由華人之功；蓋華人以其智慧與血統注入退羅民族，而後暹羅人精神煥發，此乃公認之事也。」誠望含有中國血統之暹民族，對於勤儉耐勞安分守法著稱之華僑，重新親善，俾其有在暹發展商業之機會，亦所以促進中暹之經濟貿易。</p>
<p>（3）越南華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>越南之華僑，其原籍爲廣東，福建·潮州·客家·　州·與雲南·廣西等地，數約四十餘萬人。其中居留交趾支那者佔百分之五十二，柬埔寨佔百分之三十三，東京百分之一十一，安南百分之三，老撾百分之一。華僑初履越南者，大都身外無長物，惟憑其商業天才，與節約儉樸，從而積蓄小資本，經營小販，漸次成爲大商家。在十七世紀起，華僑已掌握全越之商業。越南在國際市塲上是用原料以換取製成品，其生產品中有米·橡皮·魚·牲畜·獸皮·煤·鋅·錫·鐵·鐵礬土·錳·鎢和磷酸鹽。輸入則爲棉花·絲·五金器材·煤油·和汽車·越南雖產棉花，但不足自給，每年由外國輸入百分之九十五，價値達二億四千九百萬法郞，照一九三三年每越幣一比斯他等於二金法郞伸合，年在四億九千八百萬法郞(一九三二年以前，每一比斯他等於二法郞三角二分）。據一九三五年之統計：越南輸出方面，食料品爲七二·一％，原料品爲二四·九％；輸入方面，完成品爲六五·八％，原料品爲三四·二％。此爲其經濟之特徽。</p>
<p>法國之勢力進入越南，以一八六二年西貢條約正式佔領交趾支那爲契機，與一八八五年支配交趾支那，柬埔寨，東京，安南，老撾及安南一切一國，而在一八九一年組織聯邦，完全完成其統治。在法國完全統治越南之前後，所有法國與本地人之交涉，主要以華僑爲助手，蓋越南人留存有五朝朝代排外思想，避免與西人接觸，法國因此一方面予華僑享有承辦間接稅之徵收權利。鹽，酒，鴉片之販賣與徵稅，悉爲華僑所辦。後以此項利權巨大，收歸法國行政廳取賣，但因華僑反對，法方讓步，名義官辦，實權仍在華僑手中。另一方面，法國總統於一八九七年令分亞洲人（事實上幾全爲華僑）爲六級，年納由最低十比斯他至四百比斯他之人頭稅，或爲身份稅(Impotpersoanl),越南人僅納二比斯他，歐美等外僑則免納，爲一種不公平之苛稅。</p>
<p>在一般商業上，法國人以華僑爲其與本地人民交易之媒介，故形成華僑一種買辦（Broker）職業。其特別有勢力者，爲銀行買辦，法國銀行如無華僑買辦簽字，便無法貸出款項。此外有貿易買辦；輸入買辦是提供外洋貨品與本地人民，輸出買辦是從本地人民生產者買入土貨以供出口，從中取到手續費。</p>
<p>越南之經濟，可謂完全握在華僑手中：其中最大者，要算碾米業，包括黍米，辣椒，山貨等雜糧及其交易。碾米工廠及其輸出業，大多集中在接近西貢之鎖蘭市。據一九三二年之調查，中國人開設之碾米工廠有七十五家，法國人開者只有三家。碾米業者，都從事於白米之販賣及輸出，米商及輸出商，自己購買糙米者很少，因有極多專門辦糙米之商人。此項亦是華僑獨佔。其次爲棉業，華僑亦幾估與米業同樣之地位，但因法國資本之雄厚及競爭，自一九三〇年以降，農棉業已爲法資本所奪。再其次爲砂糖。在砂糖之生產，華僑亦佔居獨佔地位，所有甘庶之買入與借款，以及製糖廠之經營，都集中在華僑手中。糖業之中心在碉司亞，此地華僑經營之工廠有二十家以上。其他全越之製糖廠，有五分之四爲華僑所開辦。其他如樹膠，要材，船業，運輸，洋貨，街市業（屠宰肉食，蔬菜，）香料，茶，綢緞以及籐貨之交易，亦悉在華僑手中。此外零賣商人及各商，爲歡亦極多。商業而外，其他企業中華僑之勢力則微弱，以鑛業言之，華僑固爲開拓者，但法人以開係太大，乃奪之而去，華僑之勢力極微。</p>
<p>現在法國人手中之事業：有（一）電力，（二）辦船廠，（三）大工廠，（四）電車，（五）汽車，（六）啤酒業，（七）鴉片烟。此外華僑經濟命脈之金融資本，因法國政府規定必須儲存法蘭西國家銀行，可謂全部華僑之經濟命脈，完全在法國操縱之下。</p>
<p>一九四〇年九月二十二日，日軍不戰而入　越南，法越總督在日人氣頤指使之下，將華僑經濟團體——榖米，託谷保業起落貨，麺包，酒務，屠業，菒商，造護，製谷磨，谷磨華工，車衣，裁縫，洋服，絲業職工，婦女縫衣，製帽商業，刺織，婦女棉織，木行，磚瓦，風爐，玻璃，玻璃罐，木器家俬，舊貨家俬，籐器，竹器，洋燭香皂，朋館行商，機器聯合，鐵商，工業，製履，馬車，印務行商，印刷，石印，洋貨商，理髮，婦女儉德，女子讀書，攝影，音樂等五十六個單位公會工會等社團、悉予封閉解散，所有各華僑團體之一切動產與不動產，亦全部沒收與拍賣，所得之款撥交各該團體所在地之慈善機關，作爲義款，華僑經濟損失殊大。日本投降，盟國勝利，越南故土恢復，尤其自本年二月廿八日中法平等新約簽訂後，越南對於華僑經濟之活動，理應有所改進。</p>

<p>全城鬼哭神號，雞犬不寗，不幾個月，鬼子爲了要抽調兵力，縮短防綫，從東台鹽阜各地撤退下來，但單獨不放棄如皋；因爲鬼子浪人和媚敵漢奸，他們都認爲「金如舉」還有膏血可以吮吸，所以堅持不放，繼續敲精吸髓。接着，游擊隊上城反攻，鬼子又在四城門大燒民房，弄得許多人無家可歸。等到汪記「政府」成立，政治路綫完全放在綁財神敲竹槓上面去，就這樣受了足足七年多的淪陷罪。如皋人民在屈辱忍受當中，一點一滴地付出了他們的血和肉；好容易待到抗戰勝利，和平有望，可是又來了一套「解放戰」震大價砲火，城內外人民，無辜犧牲的不知多少，地方旣已「解放」，如皋人渴盼着今後能恢復已往正常的生活了；但事實却使他們失望，「解放區政府」不但沒有民主自由賦予他們，而且還帶來了「革命」，鬥爭，算賬，一連串的虐政，如火如荼地瘋在展開。於是有產者沒落了，無產者失業了，一切工商業歸了「公營」，從前還可以倫偸地吃一碗屈辱飯的，現在連這一點都辦不到，不幸的如舉人民，他們開始需要控訴，但向誰控訴呢？</p>
<p>死亡边缘的挣扎</p>
<p>如皋人民遭受了如斯巨大的痛苦，直到政府收復如皋，才稱轉換了生活新生。但是他們還不能就此掙脫了戰爭的威脅，在它的週邊，丁埝，楊花橋，分界，曾續有幾次驚天動地的戰役，這都是共軍所發動的所謂「戰略形勢」。在丁埝的鬼頭街，斜三官廳，這樣鬼氣森森的地方上，共軍發動了數萬人的包圍戰，曾宣傳俘虜國軍第四十九師長王鐵漢，但是，結果王師長並沒有被俘，它自己却有上萬人的死傷。那些死屍倒在田裏，溝浜裏，漸漸地腐了，臭了，走到那裏，到現在還隱隱聞着腐屍臭，在楊花橋，宋家莊，經過六天七夜的血戰，那裏沒有一間完整的房子，也没有完整的田禾，居民的所有全毀了，大家死的死，逃的逃，到而今，還有許多人沒有敢跑回來看一看他被燬的家園。在分界，雙方的砲彈像倒芋頭蘿蔔似地朝下直　，可憐那些「衝呀！衝呀」！的「民兵」，「武工隊」，都糊里糊塗的葬送在這裏。</p>
<p>古城黯然失色了。</p>
<p>國軍進城了，戰事吿一段落了，大家希望交通漸漸恢復，商業活動慢慢復興；可是，衝散在四郊的共軍，經過整理改編，又開始蠶動起來，並且得到北面的增援，它們又選擇公路最弱的據點—丁埝，白蒲，反攻過來，這一次，國軍的正規部隊和交通警，雖給了它有力的打擊，先後殲減近萬人，但是丁埝方面的交通，終於暫時給截斷了，如皋城又成了三面被包園的形勢。這裏我們應該感謝如皋古城，這舊世紀的建築，竟傳奇似地保護了城內住民的安全。在日裘，共軍因爲怕飛機偵察，躱在高粱田裏不敢活動，夜裏「衝呀！衝呀！」又爬不上城來，這古城像保姆似的緊抱着城裏的人民，城內駐軍的沉着和決心，使共軍毫無辦法，只有緊緊包圍封鎖，限制米草等進城，可憐城裏人民，目前連蔬菜都吃不到一點，好些窮民，簡直靠上次第一批進城的救濟麵粉來維持。觀察最近情勢，共軍預定反攻的幾處城鎭，都沒有到手，如皋城當然是更談不到了。但是如舉的解圍，大概还需相當時日，因爲那地方的早糧地太多了，很利於共軍的掩避。再等幾時，高梁玉米都將收割，國軍的增援也將公路打通了，共軍無法在附近鄉間潛藏活動，它們的反攻，即將全部瓦解了。</p>

<h3>蘇北「明殺案」</h3>
<p>— 九月十六日揚州訊　本報特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>轟動一時的李聞暗殺案，在各報上是一件特號標題的「頭條新聞；成千成百小民的生命之被　明殺」也該算是新聞吧。</p>
<p>先從一月以前的情况談起：</p>
<p>「江都二十九日電：揚州仙女廟當而共軍，今日小規模出動騷擾，此或爲大規模攻勢之前奏。又邵伯湖西南地區，近亦時有共軍活動。據邵伯喬默等地逃出之難民稱：共軍現在各該地區大肆屠殺，所謂「親政府」人民婦孺，均難倖免，劉家莊一地即達三百餘人，其殺人方法，令人髮指。某人被捕後，被推入糞坑，浸的半小時，將其提出，更於烈日之下令着棉衣，如此者再，受刑者在喊絕命，共軍以此爲樂。」</p>
<p>裸體逃命</p>
<p>這樣的事實，在這月份中，是第二次了。第一次是十三日至十五日那兩天，邵伯及高郵的共軍，分向湖西（高郵湖西）一帶出擊與竄擾，高郵縣屬之七區送駕橋和菱塘橋，以及江都縣屬八區之公道橋等地的民衆，同樣遭共軍慘殺者爲數尤甚於此次。當時，據自各該地逃來揚城之人士親口談述：「公道橋一個鄉鎭，原有居民二百餘戶，人口以五人一戶計，總數約爲一千人左右，經過兩天的慘殺，及紛紛逃亡的結果，終於眞是鷄犬也不存了。連六十歲以上的老人，若干年（包括日寇侵佔國土時）從未離開鄕土者，此次也不得不逃出了鄕土。因此，幾僩地方總結起來，逃開鄉土來至揚城者，達五千人，（前某報載五萬人，誤。）單揚城北郊之蓮性寺中，就收容了有六百餘人。他們多數是赤着膊，他們的講述完全使我相信是眞實。他們逃出時多數的是在夜間，因爲急於逃命，故連穿上一件上褂的時間也沒有。還有一部份，據說逃出來的當時，是渾身赤膊的，因爲在習慣上，在熱熱的夜裏，他們每每是不穿褲子睡覺的。</p>
<p>割斬嚗溺</p>
<p>有一家人家，十一口人被共軍慘殺掉了十個整數，逃出虎口獲得生存的一個是翻後牆頭才沒事的。而慘劇演出的方式，若干兒童被細綁了拋往河中以死，是方式的一種，另外尙有三種不同的方式。一種便是前面那條電訊裏所說的「曝死」。其次，爲「腰斬」與「割頸」。</p>
<p>什麼是「腰斬」就是用一種舊式的「切架」的大鍘刀將人齊腰一斬兩段。</p>
<p>什麼是「割頸」？「割頸」就是用普通的切菜刀，在人的頸項上割繩子樣的割殺。</p>
<p>這些講述，揚邑的人士，你如來問起他，他準會同樣對你講述的。世界的大智慧者，大科學家，大宗敎家都說，「人類有天賦的各種大慾，第一，是康健與保存生命。……」那麼，人們怎樣會不關心與知道這種可能會臨到自已頭上的不幸事件？</p>
<p>心底呼聲</p>
<p>不必問人民的「親政府」行爲是犯的，什麼罪我在結束這篇通訊以前，我覺得：爲蘇北人民生命的堪虞，爲全人類生命的意義，我要作一種求生的咸喊。問時，我要想對國家的現行法律提起控訴——一個兩個人的遭慘殺書，是「刑事案」，兇手是要被構成「殺人罪」的；而千百人生命的同時被明殺，我們的法律便何在？「聞人」的生命是應該比較看得重要的，但，小民的生命在法律上，在天賦的生存權利上是不是生命？</p>
<p>請不要以爲我的呼喊太高亢，也不要以爲這是我新聞記者多餘的主觀意見，這是每一個蘇北善良人民心底的呼聲。</p>
<p>末了，我還要想請大家來　習一支歌，那是抗戰初期「保衛大武淡」時候最流行的：「起來，同胞們！他殺死我們的父母！他殺死我們兄弟！起來，同胞們！他殺死我們的姊妹！他殺死我們的妻兒！起來，同胞們！…………」溫習了這首歌，你的腦海內翻騰了些什麼？作爲一個新聞記者的我，呵，我不忍再說了！</p>
<h3>北望家園烽煙處處洪水滔滔　蘇北難民在棺材上或坐或躺　跟死人只隔一層壁</h3>
<p>— 鎮江四日訊　王寒鷗</p>
<p>「秋風秋雨愁煞人」，此時此景，恐怕祇有流亡的蘇北難民最能親切體騐到。他們的家給毀了，人流亡在外面，在秋風瑟瑟裏，北望家鄕，烽煙處處，洪水汪洋；…萬斛愁思，叢集心頭，想不到在舉國歡騰，羣慶復員的勝利一年後，還在飽嘗着辛酸痛苦的流離之苦！</p>
<p>在鎭江，踡居在收容所裏，鄂躅在街頭上的流亡難民，比較江南其他城市特別多。鎭江是江蘇省會，同時又是大江南北往來的一個交通孔道，難民一上來就到鎭江，鎭江是他們當然的保姆。在此地，不但離開了「鬥爭」的恐怖，而且還得到溫餒的救濟。就這樣鎭江容納了萬千難民，城裏城外有幾十處收容所，招待所，各縣着後救濟協會，救濟站……，在省政當局，行總的主持下，解救了大批從蘇北逃亡出來的難民生活。記者到一個收容所裏去觀光，這是某省會館的一處山莊，陰暗的屋裏浮厝着許多同鄕會的棺材，棺材裘是死人。棺材旁邊却橫列着難民的舖蓆，坐着躺着許多男女老小。</p>
<p>這裏面已有一家數口的，也有祇是一個單身漢的。憔悴的面容，刻劃着他們苦惱的痕跡。他們逃出來好幾個月，一切所有都化着吃到肚皮裏去了。現在差不多都祇靠救濟麵粉，每天冲糊漿來解決饑餓。雖然這樣困苦，他們還是安然忍受。他們每個人都有一篇說不完的辛酸故事，你一問到他或她，馬上就會滔滔地向你傾訴。開口就是「可怕哩」！「可怕哩」！接着說出許多驚心動魄的殘酷故事。最後，他們指着棺材對記者說：「先生，你看，現在，我們住在這可憐的地方，和死人隔了一層壁，但是我們並不覺得害怕，想起在家裏，才眞和死人隔了一層壁，隨時有送命的危險呢！」</p>
<p>這些難民的成份，中產以上和識字的知識份子佔多數。從他們堅苦嚴肅的流亡生活中，可看出他們並沒有失去蘇北人勤苦勞作的本性。他們帮助條築馬路，到山上挖泥搬石，替山田人家砍柴，幹着一切辛苦的勞動工作，拿着最低廉的些微工資—最小工價每天祇得着五六百元。最近，鎭江已有幾段馬路，是難民們帮助修築完成的。每天他們跑到救濟站去看通吿：「某機關招僱火伕一百名，」「某車站徵僱路工八十名，」這是他們可能得到的一點工作，和改善生活程度的一點希望。</p>
<p>城裘中山路的報館區，牆上貼着七八張地方報，這是每天早晨難民麕集的地方，從七點鐘到十點鐘，都是人頭擠擠，他們找尋着家鄕的消息，看着並談着戰局，看着看着，看出希望來了，淮陰淮安一大片地方給國軍收復，他們得着保護還鄉的機會了。於是又看同鄉會的消息，淮安·淮陰·睢寗·泗陽·十幾張救濟協會的通吿貼佈在牆上，吿訴他們到什麼地方去登記，供給川資送他們還鄉。「你的登記處在那個地方呢？」「和我們是一道的吧？」大家談着說着，非常有勁。可是蘇北還有些沒有經國軍收復的地方呢，雖然也有各縣救濟協會的通吿，同樣呌他們到辦事處去登記，準備還鄕的手續，那些難民們憂心冲冲地說：「馬上會有辦法嗎？共產黨又在想拖哩」秋風起了，難民所裏的設備有些不蔽風雨，寒衣也成了問題，遠對着秋收豐稔的蘇北，他們實在盼望着還鄕！</p>
<h3>勞動運動在日本</h3>
<p>— 二日東京專電　本報特派員傳俊儀</p>
<p>戰後日本勞動運動發展的過程，可劃分爲三個時期：第一期自日本投降迄去年底，此時期內日軍部御用的大日本產業報國會解散，社會黨松岡駒吉所領導的勞動總同盟，全國工會評議會各團體領袖，於一月三日召開勞工團體中央籌備擴大會議，決定暫時注重於各工會單位之組成，共產黨亦於去年十一月八日召開全國黨代表大會，會中決定與社會黨勞動總同盟採取共同鬥爭的方針，同時並自行獨立進行組織各會，於是日本的勞動運動就在這兩支派的領導下，各自展開了有組織的活動，該期的特徵是各個工會在組織上毫無聯系，要求多屬於經濟方面，如增加工資，承認工會等。</p>
<p>第二期自去年迄今年二月，此時期內共產黨所領導的全國各產業職工總會籌備會，於二月底成立各工會，乃根據地域及資本系統的區別而有了橫的結合，主要要求在要求與資方訂立團體契約及參加生產經營。</p>
<p>第三期自本年二月以迄今日，該期的特徵是鬥爭的形式由經濟範圍逐漸轉變爲政治範圍，主在打倒吉田內閣，同時因政府停止戰時貼補政策，且因有大批工廠業已指定列於賠款項內，致生產力减縮，而將產生大批失業後備軍，所以目前鬥爭的目標，在要求全部就業工人須予以僱用。</p>
<p>工潮起伏</p>
<p>就工潮起伏的情形而論，據厚生省發表統計：二三兩月工潮爲一百件至一百卅件，而四五兩月則增至一百五十件至一百六十五件。自日本投降後迄五月底，計發生工潮一千一百三十件，參加的工人有九十一萬八千人，六月後工潮逐漸减少，計一百五十五件，七月再减爲一百另一件，主要的原因是因麥帥發放大批糧合所致。可是最近又有逐漸增加的趨勢。最近國有鐵道職工及海員工潮，雖吿解決，而工會內部意見，尙未一致，同時報界職工，亦在醞釀罷工。再就發生工潮的產業部門而論，本年頭五個月內，工潮六六三件中，機械工具工業佔一七四件，約百分之廿五以上，炭礦佔九十八件，計百分之十四以上，交通計九十六件，金屬工業計四十六件，鋸木工計四十二件，工潮多集中於此等工業，係因該項工業的工人階級意識較强所致。再就地域而論，東京及北海道工潮最多，而工業中心地帶的大阪及福岡反較少。</p>
<p>兩大派系</p>
<p>如上所述，現在日本勞動運動，是由二大派系所領導，一是屬於社會黨所領導的勞動工會總同盟，另一個則是由共黨所領導的全國各產業職工總會。前者有會員八十萬，後者有一百三十萬人，參加工會組織的勞工，計三百萬人，而參加這兩個組織的會員，則爲二百十萬。其他九十萬人，則採取中立的態度。總同盟的會長係松岡駒吉戰時曾任國民精神總動員本部評議員，軍事保護式專門委負，有人把他比做美國的格林（Wiliam．Grreen），而把全國各產業職工總會會長聽濤克已比做馬萊，（Philip　Marry）全國各產業職工總會的性格，是否定資本主義而主張各產業工人採取一致行動，以共同鬥爭的方法，由經濟的鬥爭進而進向政治的鬥爭。總同盟的方針則以經濟鬥爭爲原則。在這次國有鐵道職工工潮中，社會黨的能度表現得非常鮮明，不贊成工人實行罷工，深恐該項罷工轉變爲政治鬥爭，同時社會黨的書記長西尾末廣，在廿八日的第二次黨代表大會中聲稱：認同盟罷工爲兇器，主張一切黨的政策，應通過議會求其實現。同時，全國各產業職工總會於八月十九日成立大會中，決定應保障工會有支持政黨的自由，並以共同鬥爭的方式，自下面上，以實現勞動戰綫的統一，換言之，即接受共產黨的領導。</p>
<p>資方攻勢</p>
<p>由於這一重要政治觀點各異，迄無統一希望，隨着勞動運動的澎湃，資方的攻勢亦隨之而逐漸加强。最近議會中所通過勞動關係調整法可說是資方對勞方攻勢的第一步。社會黨共產黨及其他少數黨派，在議會中極力反對，惟因自由進步兩黨贊成，卒經議會通過。該項法規，規定公益事業的員工不得任意罷工，同時規定於申請調停期間，未滿卅日不得罷工。官史及公務員亦不得罷工，同時，經濟安定本部鑒於目前勞資糾紛多帶有政治性質，有發展爲倒閣運動的可能，主張成立勞務協議會，邀請勞資雙方及第三者參加，而資方有力團體，如經濟同友會，最近亦會就目前勞資糾紛，發表聲明，主張勞資雙方協調，求企業合理化之實現，反對政府大量裁員，實行企業合理化之主張，惟工人亦不應任意反對裁員，應經勞資雙方組織之經營協議會，實行生產經營之合理化。該會係由關西財界方面的重要份子所組成，是帶有一種政治性的經濟團體，起草該聲明書者，爲前曾服務於重工業企畫部之野田信介，自去年麥帥頒佈官界肅淸令后，財界一般與財閥通聲氣之上層份子，多已消聲匿跡。迄本年八月中，此等份子始稍露頭角，或由其子姪出面，如最近宣吿成立之經濟團體聯合會，與過去的工業俱樂部屬於同一性質，參加該會的團體爲日本產業協會化學工業聯盟會全體，金融協議會，日本商工經濟會，商工各業聯合會，日本貿易協會，而經濟團體聯合會的重要職員，多由同友會會員所祖任，故該會所發表之勞資問題聲明書，係代表資方之有力意見，自不待言。最近，日本銀行調查局長岩本眞冶對朝日新聞記者談稱：此后日本企業應由勞資雙方參加經營，故認爲經濟協議會有成立的必要，可是勞動者直接參加策劃，有受政治利用之處。</p>
<p>工會政策</p>
<p>現在日本勞工組織的最大缺點，是組織的指導力薄弱，例如五月二十日舉行糧食示威運動時，國營鐵道職工東京方面工會居然通令各支部强迫免費乘車，參加遊行，結果爲第八軍當局所禁止。東京帝大敎授社會政策學專家大河內一男，在彼所著「戰后社會政策」這小册子中謂：日本勞動階級，自明治維新以來，在精神上即缺乏自主性。</p>
<p>資本的自身營利的立塲，已有限度，故工程師經營指導者，職工，以及與經營有關的各級代表應共同參加經營，拋棄資太營利的經營形式，而採取以生產力爲中心的全體經營形式，此即經營的社會化，也可說是經營的民主化。可是日本的工會法，僅注重第一種任務，日本的工會現應一舉而實現這兩種任務。更不幸的，是日本勞動階級對於實行這兩種任務的訓練，尤未成熟，這便是日本工會運動的悲劇。</p>

<h3>婦女解放的將來</h3>
<p>— 嚴皓英</p>
<p>婦女運動，發生已久，但從二十世紀開始到現在的三四十年，纔顯出眞正的力量。過去的婦女遝動太零碎，太無組織，僅是少數知識婦女的個人活勸而不是全般婦女的集團遝動，她們的政策常偏於局部的改善而忽略根本的救治。婦女運動到了目前纔是有組織地在進展，而解決當在光榮的將來。</p>
<p>婦女運動重要的趨向，就是由爲少數婦女爲自已謀幸福而轉到爲全般的婦女謀幸福；由少數的知識婦女領導活動的擴大到由全般的被壓迫的婦女參與爭鬥。</p>
<p>其次就是，她的發展的重心將在於經濟的解放方面。因爲從社會進化的歷史上看，經濟制度對於人類的生活實在有着非常重要的影響。婦女所受到的一切壓迫完全是男性宗法社會的經濟制度所造成的。婦女的性的從屬與政治的從屬不過是經濟的從屬的結果。所以婦女要待到性的解放與政治的解放，其關鍵還是在於經濟的解放方面。</p>
<p>把社會職業的門戶開放了容許婦女去參與，並不能看爲婦女已經得到經濟解放的表證；這僅是滿足了達到經濟解放的一個步驟，社會中是和家庭中一樣的有着經濟壓迫的事實的。在技能上缺乏訓練而情勢上急於得到工作的婦女，乃成爲壓迫的一個對象。正如婦女於進入職業之際，所做的都是些酬報低廉時間漫長的討厭的以至齷齪的工作。她們差不多不能以所入的工資維持自已的生活，而工作的繁重郤磨折去了她們身體的健康。</p>
<p>近代婦女的進入於職業界，雖說婦女運動者的鼓吹宣傳不無力量，但多半是由於產業革命的大勢所促成，在這時，科學發明對於家庭的改革尚未完畢，婦女於生活的急潮中奔向社會，被納入生產的組織，而家庭的責任還是絆着她們的手足，不容她們稍待安息。婦女於得到了形式上的解放後，郤在同時担負起了家事管理的責任，社會生產的資任以至種族蕃衍的責任。這樣逾分的辛勞，實際上並沒有受到相當的酬報，還揭示給目前的婦女運動者知道在發展婦女職業的進程中，同時不能忽略了家庭組織的改造。婦女的解放是應當面面兼顧到的：婦女離開了家庭到社會服務，則家事不得不謀其簡單化；婦女投入於社會生產組織中，則待遇酬報等不得不謀其改善提高，使不致成爲對於婦女的新壓迫；還有婦女雖從社會職業生活中謀到經濟的獨立，但對於種族的生存照舊負着責任，所以社會在力所能及的地方當使在良好的情形下發展其母性。</p>
<p>總上所述，我們可以結諭到將來婦女運動的發展，對於下述的三件事必加注意：</p>
<p>第一，國家的保護。國家保護的方法主要就是制定婦女的勞働法。目前，已經有許多國家，因爲婦女運動者的督促而注意到這件事，雖然這種新的立法，能吾使婦女受到實益，還得看雇主的誠意如何而定，但有了這起端，將來的發展總有希望。現在許多國家在制定婦女勞働法時所注意的是：廢除夜工，减短工作時間；提高酬報，規定最低工資；禁止雇用婦女作重力工作及危險工作；保護母性，規定產婦於分娩前後有數星期之例假，薪金照給，或不給工資而酌給保產金等等。</p>
<p>第二，家事社會化。要使家庭雜事不成爲婦女的社會發展的障礙，就應該將他們從婦女手中取來交給社會代管。這是一種極有趣味的嘗試，科學的進步將使這種嘗試成爲許多現代人所不敢設想的一種進步。除了蘇聯和美國外，目前許多國對於家事的社會化還未敢嘗試。但是，照現今的趨勢，婦女終將從「家庭的天地」中脫身出來成爲社會的一份子，蘇聯已在社會的急變中將家庭的一切職務移歸國家辦理，成爲一種公的事情，美國則因爲社會事業的發達，家事已漸漸由社會上一部分人取去代辦成爲一種商業組織。這二者的方法雖不相同，但顯示一共通之點，即一般的家事，由社會代替舊日的主婦辦理。在將來，點綴社會的新建設的，爲公共宿所，公共洗濯處，公共食堂，公共娛樂室或娛樂塲等；婦女在那時方始是一完全的自由人，她除了和男子一樣的爲社會勞働外，再不須做男子的家庭雜務的管理人了。</p>
<p>第三，兒童公育。兒童的敎義本也是家事的一種這裏把牠分開來講，不過是要顯示牠的重要而已。婦女在家庭中的所司的職務，最重要的就是育兒。當婦女職業解放運動開始的時候，男性的堅持反對也都據此爲理由。但自從敎育心理等科學知識進步以後，知道由社會特設的公育機關代替母性管理和敎育兒童，不僅在衛生健康方面爲有利，就在兒童心理觀念方面也有着極大的社會的價値。這正和婦女解放的要求相吻合。現代幼稚院嬰兒院設施的普遍，已開了兒童公育運動的緒端。等到兒童公育制度實現時，婦女的社會解放差不多可以完全無間題了。</p>
<p>總之，我們可以斷言，婦女問題得到解決的時候，也就是人類中消滅了不平與壓迫的時候，到那時，展開在我們前面的世界是有着完全的自由與平等了。</p>
<h3>美國婦女攜帶兒童前往參加選舉會</h3>
<h3>孩子的牙齒</h3>
<p>— 國昌</p>
<p>假使在你面前站着兩個兒童，第一個兒童的牙齒是整齊而晳白的，第二個兒童的牙齒則生得非常不整齊，焦黃而帶着惡劣的口臭，那末你將歡喜那一個呢？當然，從外貌來看，第二個兒童無疑的會給你留下一種不良的印象了。</p>
<p>牙齒的整齊及健康，實在基於孩童期間的家長的注意及保護。如果兒童期內，做父母不注意到，則他們將來牙齒的排列必定是雜亂不齊而多蛀蝕的，這樣必會造成子女們終生的遺憾。</p>
<p>牙齒是人體上骨質的一部份，大體上說來，它的外面被堅硬的琺瑯質所包圍，琺郡質的裏面是較柔軟的象牙質，牙齒的中心便是神經及血管等。牙齒如果被細菌侵入，則極易蛀蝕。所以賢明的父母應該在子女幼小的時候就當心他們的牙齒。做父親的或者因爲外面工作較忙的緣故，往往無暇顧及兒女，那麼做母親的就應該祖起這個責任。以下是幾條保護牙齒的守則，希望能切實呌兒童做到：</p>
<p>（一）使兒童養威早起及臨睡刷牙的良好習慣，因爲不刷牙齒，則齒縫中腐敗的食物極易滋生細菌，進而蛀蝕牙齒，妨礙消化，終至罹腸胃病。</p>
<p>（二）兒童期間永久齒方才長成，勿令咬嚼硬果及過燙或過冷的食物，以免損傷瑯質及齒神經等。</p>
<p>（三）兒童最愛糖食，務令少吃。</p>
<p>（四）多給他們吃富於鈣質的食物，如花生米，萬笋及榖類等。因爲牙齒的大部份是鈣質所組成，人體中如缺少鈣質，就會將齒中的鈣抽去補充，牙齒就會蛀蝕。所以應該常常補充鈣質。</p>
<p>（五）如突然牙痛數秒鐘即止，應立刻請良好的牙醫師診治，因爲這往往是牙齒要蛀的預兆。</p>
<p>（六）如牙齒已蛀蝕成洞，切勿任意拔去，因爲胡亂拔去之後，附近的牙齒往往都會動搖而容易脫落的。應盡量設法鑲補。</p>
<p>（七）當六七歲掉乳齒時，應請良好牙醫師診察，以免將來永久齒的屬雜亂列。</p>
<p>（八）食後必嗽口。</p>
<p>（九）手指勿放入口中，因手指上細菌極多，非但易使牙齒蛀蝕，而且容易傳染其他疾病。</p>
<p>以上九點簡單而容易實行，祇須做父母的平時稍稍對兒女注意注意，則子女們將來一生的幸福，美麗，健康的基礎，就此可以自小奠定了。</p>
<h3>在修容術上　雞蛋的功用</h3>
<p>— 余人鳳</p>
<p>我們誰都知道鷄蛋是件有用的寳貝，因爲它含有多量的蛋白質，不但好吃，而且在實業上和醫藥上，也成了必然的大量的需要。現在我要提起的它的在修容上的兩件功用，也不能不說是它的副作用吧。</p>
<p>第一，我們感覺到「臉孔」對於人生的重要，尤其是女人。一個有了幾個孩子的中年女人，臉上的皺紋簡直就和老太婆差不多了。這樣一個如鷄皮般的臉，怎能令人發生好感呢？這就應該用這個法子把他醫治一下了：先將鷄蛋一枚（卵黃與卵白）置於茶杯中，和黑砂糖混合攪攔之，待其凝固之後，再慢慢澆上些水，而成爲光滑的狀態，那就算成功了。（但你須把成槐的黑砂糖用力慢慢削碎，以免有雜質參在其中，因而擦傷你的皮膚。）於是，你就把它當作洗臉用的肥皂，（甚或不加黑砂糖，僅加以少量的水，則更簡單矣。）在那洗臉或洗浴時，用手挖些在掌心中摩勻，從面部一直擦到胸部，這時你變成了一個阿比西尼亞的戰士，但是你千萬不要笑，因爲笑的時候，你的臉的筋肉就牽動了，那是不好的。所以這時你若是洗浴，請你儘管洗下去，恰恰到你洗完了的時候，臉上的藥料（姑妄言之）也許要快乾了，這時你的臉會感覺到發緊，但不要慌，等乾了以後，用溫水慢慢洗去，你將發現臉蛋是多麼的光滑如玉了啊！</p>
<p>第二，鷄蛋的洗髮法，這是一個保護修理頭髮的最好方法，如果你能常行不懈，它不但能使你的頭髮格外顯出光澤和美麗；而且也不易於脫落。那就是在你預備洗髮的前一天晚上，用水先把你的頭髮洗得乾乾凈凈，把汚垢除去，再用純良上等的髮油洗刷一遍，以後把兩個鷄蛋（黃白都要）打在個預備好的洗險盆裏，用兩手從頤皮一直到髮端充分地摩洗着，在頭皮的地方，用梳子梳或用指尖抓撓；在髮的中部及髪端，可以兩手捧而揉之，如是能有一次四五遍的擦洗，再用水洗去。只要能這樣的作去，從年靑一直到老年，頭髮是不易變白的，即是變白，那髮也很潤澤，使人發出一種美感。婦女在生產後，是容易脫髮的，如運用這個法子，就可以避免，這都是眞實的經騐之談，切勿等閒視之。</p>
<p>有心的讀者何妨試試看！</p>
<h3>夫婦間的靜態美</h3>
<p>— 陳天鐸</p>
<p>在路上，或者在公園裏，我們常看到許多新婚的夫婦，一對對手攙着手，俯首靠頸，在談着娓娓的情話。的確，新婚的生活，是最甜蜜的，但是我們再翻開每天的報紙來看，離婚的人數，亦不斷地在增加，他們或她們因不懂得怎樣保特婚後夫婦變方問內心的靜態美而嚐到了愛的苦味，所以西諺有云；「愛能造成喜劇，亦能造成悲劇」；法國俚歌有：「愛的歡樂，剎那間即消逝，愛的痛苦，永遠留連在心頭」；甚至現在有人在高唱：「結婚即懋愛的墳墓」。這些，都因不懂得怎樣追求人生至高無上的藝術和儘量發揮蘊藏在內心深處的靜能美所致。</p>
<p>所謂內心美者，即係指英文Inner-Manner而言，蓋人類本有外態（Oeet-Manner）與內態（Inner-Manner）二種之分別。外態如肉體之滿足，物質之亨受與名利之追求等，並不能抵過內心靈魂眞實的需要。靜態美即是內心美的一種，假使丈夫每天工作歸來，精神已感到相當疲倦，這時，他正需要一些輕靜的安慰，以調劑補償他日間枯燥繁重的工作，但是做妻子的却徧不識時務，硬要他陪煎她去買衣料，或嚕囌着孩子下學期的學費，或柴米等價的高漲，妳想，這時的他聽了將感到如何的憎惡和不快。我曾經見到一個現代化的家庭，夫婦均受過高深的敎育，並能相當瞭解愛的藝術，每當他辦公完畢，拖着疲倦的身子，回到家門的時候，做妻子的並不跟他多說，祗對他微微的一笑，這一笑，已够使得他精神爲之一振，疲勞過去大半。其次，她再呌她的孩子爲他爸爸拿拖鞋，她自己更親手冲了杯熱的咖啡或牛奶，放在他的桌傍，替他把衣服脫下來掛在衣架上。晚飯時，她把他心愛吃的小菜預備好。晚飯後，她丈夫便陪她去聽音樂，或到戲院裏，或到公園裏散步；這時，他們便可儘量地談情說愛，她如有所要求，亦得如願以償。這實在此上面所說的一位妻子高明得多了。</p>
<p>照實在講，眞正的靜態美，亦即分佈在每個細小的動作上，做丈夫的若能於靜時撫摸注意他夫人的頭髮，你將覺到她頭上每根頭髮，都好像絲錦一樣可貴，你再注視她的一對眼睛，你將發現，裏面正含着無限的深情。你的一顆心，將要被這些勾引得搖蕩起來，當你再看到她一口櫻紅小口時，我想，你將要情不自禁，擁抱她和她來一個甜蜜的接吻吧！早上，當妳夫人對鏡梳妝時，你可代她把蝴蝶結扣上，或把一朶鮮花插在她頭髮上，她內心將因此而感謝你，回眸一笑。假使做丈夫的不注意這些小節，或她生日時，忘送禮物給她，則他的結婚生活。好似有一塊暗礁，他將受不到妻子一點的溫情，更無幸福可言。</p>
<p>做妻子的假使能注意丈夫平日的舉止行動，或他辦公時跨上車子的一剎那，及談話的姿勢等，妳將要自傲他是如何的英俊大方，精神煥發，當他陪你參加宴會或在街上走時，妳臉上將露着會心的微笑，驕傲的神情，因爲，妳已得着一位如意的丈夫。</p>
<p>親愛的靑年男女們，不論你們已否結婚，愛情有吾發生障礙，我都希望你們能利用自己的才能，去儘量發揮內心的靜態美，以得到美滿的婚姻。</p>

<h3>美國名作家馬克吐溫　逝世三十六年祭</h3>
<p>— 殷懷遠</p>
<p>馬克吐溫這個名字，在中國和在世界各國一樣，不會是陌生的。馬克吐溫在短短的美國文學史上，佔著最輝煌的地位。他是小說家，散文家，同時又是一個馳名追遐邇的幽默大師。</p>
<p>文豪原名克勒門斯（Samuel　Langhorne　Clemens），馬克吐溫是他的筆名。他在一八五三年生於密蘇里州的一個小村，但却是在密士西比河的漢尼堡爾港長大的。他有天賦的敏銳的觀察力，自小就默記着這個墾荒區的每一樣奧秘的事情，立下了他以後寫的幾部不朽傑作的基礎。</p>
<p>他十二歲那一年遭父喪，這就成了他一生的轉捩點。他的母親迫於貧困，不能繼續供他讀書，就送他到一間印刷所去當學徒。馬克吐溫在印刷所裏很幸運地能夠看到全國各地的報紙，因此知識日豐，有時候他還替漢尼堡爾的報紙寫一點雜文，十七歲時，他字了一篇幽默小品，投給波士頓一份幽默　的週刊，措寫一個年青的舟子，企圖恐嚇一個身材魁偉孔武有力的樵夫，結果被打跌入水中，文意異常幽默，讀者無不捧腹。</p>
<p>馬克吐溫在未能作有價值的創作前，他不斷的研究人的各種個性和典型。他在印刷所工作了九年，使他懂得了不少大眾所愛好的幽默和諷刺文學，而且有許多機會供他執筆寫文章的，但是到了一八五七年他全然的改變了他的職業，他到一條船上去學習把舵。那一年他是二十二歲。十七個月後，他把一切都學會了，於是就升爲正舵手。</p>
<p>在那玫段時期，密士西比河是全國交通的要道，每天形形色色的人物川流不息的來往着。馬克吐溫暗中研究他們不同的個性。他的地位使他有很多空閑時間和乘客們談天，無論在船上或在岸上，他總愛聽客人們講述各地奇異的故事。他後來以當年在密士河上的見聞爲題材，寫成了一本著名的書「密士西比河上的生活」。是書在一八八二年出版。</p>
<p>他在船上生活了四年後，南北戰爭便爆發了，密士西比河上的交通也隨之而中斷。馬克吐溫和他的哥哥逃難到尼瓦達，他的哥哥後來在當地任書記官，於是他就在那裏寄居了五年。之後，他到一間報館當記者，被派前往華盛頓採訪議院立法籌論的新聞。他寫回去的通訊第一次用馬克吐溫這個筆名發表，從此他就以馬克吐溫這個名見知於世，與真名反而不彰。同時他還在報上連續的發表了許多短篇小說，使他的名在美洲不脛而走，也慢慢的傳到世界各地。</p>
<p>馬克吐溫後來離開華盛頓到舊金山，他在那裏不費力就找到了一份記者的工作。在工作上他充分的表現了他的才氣的　　，從此他的　　日隆。他在這段時期發表的一篇小說「卡力瓦拉斯鄉馳名的跳蛙」，不僅美洲各地報紙競相轉載，就是歐洲各國也很快的把它轉載或翻譯了過來，莫不以一讀爲快。馬克吐溫曾到歐洲遊歷，但是他並不崇拜歐洲的文化，反而處處讚揚美洲的一切事物。他曾說過：「歐洲的文化不足羨慕，美洲的文化自有它的前途。」可見他是一個熱愛祖國和鄉土的作家。</p>
<p>馬克吐溫是一個寫實主義者，他的一切作品都是從他的生活經驗中孕育出來的。「辛酸記」（Roughing　lt）使人讀了之後，對它在尼瓦達五年的生活匪覺可笑又復可憐。「湯姆莎葉冒險記」和「哈克巴利冒險記」，分別在一八七六年和一八八四年發表後，馬克吐溫在文學上的造詣算是達到登峰造極的境地了。前者敘述他童年時代在漢尼堡爾的生活，如入洞探險迷途不得其門而出，或在鬼魅出沒的屋子附近發掘寶藏的緊張事蹟，故事的結構異常緊密，情節也處處吸引着讀者。後者則以描寫密士西比河上的生活爲主。以上兩書是馬克吐溫生平最得意的傑作，現在也成了世界不朽的名著，他的其他得到好評的小說有「太子和乞丐」（一八八二年出版）。這部小說充份的表現了馬克吐溫對特權的鄙視，和對於不公平的憤怒。馬克吐溫晚年的最後一部傑構是「阿瑟王廷中的一個康湼特格州人」，這是一部含有諷刺性的小說，暗示着民主政體較君主政休優良。是響曾改編爲戲劇搬上舞台，獲得了千百萬觀眾的喝彩。</p>
<p>在最後的二十年中，馬克吐溫雖然繼續寫作，但却常到各地作學術的講演。他晚年名播四海，受着千百萬人的尊崇，牛津大學也於一九〇七年以文學博士學位贈給他。當他在一九一〇年逝世的噩耗付出後，舉世爲之震悼。這一代文豪的逝世，不僅是美國的損失，同時世界文壇也殞落了一顆巨星。</p>
<h3>夢生者</h3>
<p>— 莫宗</p>
<h3>羅兩峯筆下的丁敬身</h3>
<p>— 周曙山</p>
<p>清代篆刻家丁敬身，前談其友金冬心的　像，已略爲說到。茲再先看「辭海」內所載：「丁敬，濟，錢塘人，字敬身，號鈍丁，又號龍泓山人，與金農同鑒博學鴻詞。好金石，尤工篆刻，力擬秦，漢，卓然大冢，開消失滬之先河，發千數百年印學之奇秘。有「武林金石錄」，「龍泓山館詩鈔」。」又據他畫所載，尚有號硯林，並有詩集「硯林集」。</p>
<p>丁敬身本出身於杭州的釀造家，但並不甚富，故在家內常與傭人同操作。惟好金石與古畫，至嗜之成癡，因而選有名貴者，恒不惜與衣物以購之。也工詩，善畫，遂與鄉人金冬心等爲至交，以互相談　，終乃稱其城南啓所曰「詩國」。而其性格尤豪放，每於不如意時便終日　　，至習以爲常。</p>
<p>羅爾峯，名聘，字遜夫，又別署花之寺憎，清，　縣人，亦爲「揚州八怪」之一。其人善畫人物，山水，花草，梅竹，爲金冬心的義北，而以所寫「鬼趣聞」爲最見稱於時。詩亦超然物外，以布衣終身。</p>
<p>今見一幅拓本丁敬身先生像，係出於此畫家的手筆，其印亦竟曰「揚州羅聘」，至其作風的古怪，只須觀這一幅老人圖，便可明其粳慨了。時　隨圖對比有題詩云：</p>
<p>「古極龍泓像，抽象彭欲飛。看碑伸　興，拄杖從苔磯。武外隱君子，人間大布衣。似尋蝌蚪字，蒼頡廟中歸」</p>
<p>其落款於後爲：「題龍泓居士像應兩峯先生教，袁枚。」至此畫像的神箭，雖已盡於此詩交。尚有吳倉石的題詩，茲從略。又在其詩集「硯林集」之首，印有陳霖所畫比老人的像，亦與此畫像近似。</p>
<p>此畫像後歸於「丁氏鶴盧藏」，但在當時却由羅兩峯自携歸揚州者。按丁叟有手書「送詩客羅君遜夫歸揚州」詩云：</p>
<p>「作客光陰更似飛，那能送別不依依；春風未爲牽游舫，夜雨偏來濕釣磯。酒趣無緣從悵怏，夢魂雖接但依稀；惟餘一事差相慰，　裏形骸共予歸。（遜夫畫我倚杖坐石大像歸。）」</p>
<p>又有一首爲「又承贈　　於老夫，酬以一絕」云：「贈我　鞋瘦　，緣雲擬上最高峯；關苔新長茸茸地，惟許　　看過踪。」</p>
<p>關此，尚有羅兩峯致丁叟畫，與上各詩和畫　　　　一幅，亦從略。兩氏友情　　　於此已可概見；但不知在今之　苑中人，尚有此情致否耶。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　56</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「吳工程師這邊呢？」我不願他再啰嗦下去。他是生長在高麗的山東人，中國話說不清，日本語也不高明，倒是挺忠實勇敢。</p>
<p>「第三次我們跑來，繞大圈子，　　從廠後院子爬了過來，……繞到鐵道東邊，正碰見站上臨時戒嚴，站上那位認識的才伙計告訴我，「宋司令專車過去了，還有兩車衛隊」……他又告訴我長辛店的娘兒們遭劫，共有二三百，全拉到高家集去了，高家集就在這兒東北二里布地。……我想吳工程師的太太小組，定也在內。怎麼」？</p>
<p>「是呀…你們怎麼辦的？」我很焦急催他說下去。</p>
<p>「報告秘書長」，他仍像背書似的。「我們祇好拼間性命去冒險，趕至高家集，一路都是死尸，大半是搶掉的娘兒們。我們冒充日本便衣，混到隊子裏，可也沒有人來查問我們。那裏有很多日本兵，高家集的土紳供給他們吃酒作樂。我們穿進了慰安所，情形更亂。娘兒們都編了號頭，因在三所屋子和園子裏，衣服全剝光……日本兵抽籤，抽着了就帶走到別屋子去。有好些中國混混，在女人裏　　穿來。我們五個人一商量，也隨在裏面亂問，挨個兒問，「誰是吳工程師太太·小駔？」……全問到了，沒有一個人答應，我們不認識，可看去也全不像。……」</p>
<p>「這裏沒有，也許是抽籤抽去了。要是抽去，救出來出無用。我們重又混出來，也沒被人發見，地方可真亂。我也不管誰，我們又趕回站，在公路上碰見吳工程師的汽車，我們一打招呼，一路上這兒來。剛剛看見那樹底的老媽子，我當是工程師的太太，問她，她說太太小姐們全在後院子上了吊……」</p>
<p>我們回身遠　子，穿進後房，都不見人影。廚房裏沒沒有人。忽然聽得一位同志在後門嚷着「在這兒哪。」那是屋子後面的廁所。我們超出屋一瞧，這，可以說真夠淒慘。娘兒三個…吳太太，梅君，蘭君，都吊在一起，可是每人身上都有幾個子彈洞；大概她們被人發現的時候，也許剛剛慘死，所以還淌着一身血。</p>
<p>我吩咐了手下的人，怎樣安排這些尸首，便上前面來。</p>
<p>「看樣子不像昏厥，倒像心病，熟度很高。」一青年　長給我說明鼎元的情形。</p>
<p>「他本來就有病」，我告訴他，「神經衰弱，又受了這麼的刺激，也許加了旁的症狀……我看北平一時還可支持，我們送他到北平去，或是找大夫，或是進醫院，…可不知道路上能不能過去……？」</p>
<p>「試試看，一時恐怕沒有比較再好的辦法哩。領隊表示同意。」</p>
<p>我們當下雙手提機關和一袋子彈給〇四號，又囑咐他，這裏拾掇好了，上北平××飯店來找我，光通電訊也行。</p>
<p>在車子裏面，鼎元發起　語來了，不斷的喊着「芬……，孩子們呢？……芬…孩子們呢？」（節西章完）</p>
<h3>苦憶——序「金雞心」</h3>
<p>— 趙清閻</p>
<p>校畢滬版「金雞心」（重慶版書名爲「花景淚。」）不禁想到兩位最初鼓勵我，幫助我從事劇作的好友——于思和左明！他們雖撩起了我對劇作的興趣，而居然執筆了十年之久，儘管不好吧，也還寫過十幾本戲，捫心身問，總處對得住我的這兩位好友了。可是他們自己呢？一個跟着抗戰顛沛流離，苦到不能夠再苦，窮到不能夠再窮，不要說寫戲，連寫封信的情緒都沒有了！另一個則更慘！他在抗戰期間爲貧病所殺，終於悠怨地丟下筆，遠遠地走了！走到黑暗得沒有邊際的世界中去，走到使我永恆看不見他，找不着他的虛幻境裏！</p>
<p>記得十二年前，由于思的介紹，我進了天一影片公司，那時我的基本工作是主編明星日報本公司的自我宣傳版。爲了採取宣傳資料，每晚必在攝影場參觀拍片。漸漸發生了興趣了，便常和于思研討一些電影藝術上的問題，承他不嫌麻煩的指示我，使我開始對電影藝術有了較深刻的瞭解。也因爲那時我正在一面學畫，學音樂的原故，所以很自然地和電影結了緣！不久，左明與洪深，曹雪松先生等相繼加入天一，於是又從左明那裏吸收了些話劇方面的知識。我的小說「旱」出版以後，左明看罷高興地說：「你的小說很富於戲劇性，不妨改寫劇本吧！」我聽罷也很高興，但卻不敢驟然從事，我想再多研究研究。雖然很早以前也曾寫過一個獨幕劇。但總希望第二次寫出來，能夠進步些。</p>
<p>誰知在天一工作不到一年，爲回里省親，不幸無端被捕入獄，罪名是政治嫌疑。獄中無聊，便細心揣摸作劇方法，當時手邊有一本巴金翻譯的小說集，逐選了「復仇」一篇爲改編獨幕劇。出獄以後這劇本很受于思左明的賞識，取題「　債」。（抗戰初期重新處理意識，變成了一個抗戰宣傳的劇本。廿七年獨立出版社印行。）接着便和左明合作「難姊難妹」電影劇本。（吉星影片公司監製，胡珊女士主演。）共同想了故事，執筆時我分幕，他分鏡頭，我作插曲的歌詞，黃自先生謂曲。（百代公司灌片。）這期間我又進中央電影場任編導委員，剛剛寫完「模特兒」電影劇本，「七七」抗戰發生，於是我和左明領了抗戰救亡第五劇隊遷往西北。但，及抵開封，我們就分手了，我單獨參與軍委會第六部的戰地劇隊任編導，這是我第一次正式從來話劇。工作了很久，直至我到武漢主編「彈花」文襲月刊，才脫離劇隊。武漢淪陷又赴重慶，這期間于思遊記失所，左明遠居陝北，彼此消息斷絕了三年，終於在巴縣的北碚才重逢了，但于已久不　管，左明已病入齊肓！我們原想再合作幹一下戲劇的。可是于思沒有興趣了，左明沒有精力了，他們被抗戰折磨得心身俱衰老！只有我，我還孜孜不倦的傻寫着，寫些不能脫去文藝氣氛的被目爲溫·冷的劇作。「金雞心」就是這時候的產品，于思替我計劃分幕，左明替我斟酌對話，他們鼓勵我，幫助我，昂起希望寄託于我一人。他們無論在友情上，或工作上，都把我當作他們的妹妹一般看待，甚而有時像愛護一個他們自己的孩子！就爲了這點真摯的情誼，我不願辜負他們，所以我才繼續不斷的傻寫，直到寫到眼睜睜瞧着于思貧病潦倒下去了，左明死了，於是我便也厭倦地打「紅樓夢」結束了我的劇作生涯！是不是以後我就永不再寫戲了，我還不敢一定，但無論如何，我知道只要我再寫戲，我就會想到于思和左明，想這到兩位倒在世態炎涼的社會裏的朋友，我就會痛苦！痛苦，我還能寫得出什麼呵！</p>
<p>于思和左明都完了，是誰使他們完的呢？抗戰！他們爲抗戰犧牲了一切，甚而生命！可是他們得到的是什麼呢？又有誰還記得起他們呢？不要說是慰恤了，連擔提也沒人撮。國家如此忽視他們，朋友又是如此薄情待他們，如此世道，如此人心！使他們活着的（于思）固然不寒而慄，亡故的（左明）也會死不瞑目呀！</p>
<p>謹以「金雞心」獻給于思。左明兩位好友。請你們相信，無論你們在那一個世界上，你們曾經鼓勵過，幫助過的我，將永遠永遠不會忘記你們的情誼？</p>

<h3>新聞自由</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>專門担任採訪軍警機關新聞的外勤同業，昨天有一封給警備司令兼警察局長宣鐵吾的公開信，這封信雖然很簡單，但藏在這裏面的却是一種由於工作的高度熱情所燃熾的爭取新聞自由的憤激。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，我們的戰地記者出生入死，奔馳前綫，許多高級司令部都有他們的踪跡，他們往往是各將領的座上賓，不僅知道敵情，甚至也了解國軍的作戰計劃，如果稱軍事秘密，那是第一等應秘密的了。</p>
<p>勝利後，在首都，馬歇爾特使的行館，司徒雷登的大使館，也常有記者光臨；在牯嶺，蔣主席夫婦，幾乎每日遇見新聞記者。講人物，這都是最崇隆的人物。</p>
<p>我們不必再提羅斯福的大西洋憲章了，即以上海市的治安工作而論，新聞記者所貢獻於社會的，其價値，其力量，並不在軍警機關之下，不過一則是積極的，一則是消極的，殊途而同歸也。這里不妨舉一個簡單的例子：比方警備司令部槍斃了幾個販毒犯，假使沒有報紙普遍地刋戰，又怎能收到曉論人民，勿罹法網的政府禁毒用意。</p>
<p>外勤同業，爲了讀者，工作一天，就增多一頁辛苦，他們受氣捱餓，耐勞吃苦，他們並不是好事之徒，也更不是神經病，但神聖的任務在，他們不得不這麼做：上海爲世界觀瞻所緊，全國文化重心，希望在這個文明進步得風氣之先的都市裏，凡百現象得表現進步，而其中新聞自由最重要！</p>
<p>上海内幕</p>
<h3>橫行碼頭的三十六個黨</h3>
<p>— 學鷗</p>
<p>最近外輪進口，貨物上岸，時常發生偸竊缺少等情事。這決不是普通扒手所能辦得到的事，而是出於有組織的碼頭三十六個黨所爲。</p>
<p>說起碼頭三十六個黨，老上海差不多都耳熟能詳，可見他們歷史的悠久了。他們是一種變相的浪人，他們的生活和行動，介乎流氓和癟三之間，可是他們的勢力已經根深蒂固，所以雖經警務當局竭力搜捕，事實上奏效甚微，到了現在，這班碼頭三十六個黨，依舊到處橫行無忌。</p>
<p>三十六個黨，和眞正的碼顯蕩三，有着特殊的區別。三十六個黨，大多數是半路出家，而碼頭癟三，却非三考出身不可。所以現在的那些三十六個黨，老弟兄，有不少人是原來的流氓蛻化而成的。所以然的原因，不外乎是流氓不能容身於出身之地，經濟生活沒有着落，不能不投順到三直六個黨內，當一名小卒，以供驅策，逐漸的升爲正式黨徒。</p>
<p>三十六個黨平時佔據的碼頭都有一定，他們各覇一個碼頭，正和舊小說上的英雄好漢們各覇一個山頭異曲同工。他們對於碼頭，視同私產，不許別帮人擅行侵入。譬如是淸江帮的碼頭，就不許山東帮插足，即使同道中有事，要到別帮的地段上去，也得事前先派人向對方去講交情，否則便有惹起大規模械鬥的可能。過去他們時常因爲爭奪碼頭發生械鬥，傷人流血，也在所不悔。</p>
<p>上海輪船獨頭上，每天到船啓椗，無數的商旅貨運，忙得不亦樂乎。逍班三十六個黨老弟兄，就夾在裏面，乘機大施身手，撈取油水過日。過去他們注目的對象是單帮商販，硬搶軟偸，手腕很可驚人，他們還常向民船船戶索取陋規，船戶不肯給也得給。現在不斷有外貨進口，更是他們的黃金時代到了，只要施展出他們的妙手空空手段，不論是大包小件，只要偸取到手，就够他們吃喝享受一番，所以這些三十六個黨中人物，日常生活，倒是非常優游自在哩！</p>
<p>碼頭三十六個黨的存在，是上海社會的病態，並且爲害商旅不淺，所以我希望警務當局能盡量加以搜捕，最好能成立一隊碼頭巡緝隊，時常在各輪船碼頭往釆校巡，使三十六個黨無所施展手足，以安商旅。</p>
<h3>零零碎碎</h3>
<p>— W·W</p>
<p>國慶各慶，有的慶『豐收」，有的慶「乾凈」，面團幽和瘦癟癟，其間眞不可以道「理」計。</p>
<p>丁述嫌在獄不自由，他日埋在默默的野邨裏可以安靜了；周逆佛海無邊，自投苦海，也就不說不自由了。</p>
<p>中國文人說過：「我有筆如刀」！聲勢赫赫，曾幾何時？原子筆投到，「四海之內皆兄弟也」，弟兄們人人自危，即牛刀亦不敢小試矣！</p>
<p>時裝，化妝，鞋襪，美容……儘多爲女人打算，女人也正爲這些個打算，相互爲用，供求相應，經濟上道來，確是好現象，爲上海前途慶。</p>
<h3>平均每日兩人壓於吉普輪下</h3>
<p>— 黃接靑</p>
<p>據香港某華文報所載上海通訊，調八月份本市吉普車傷人事件，單以廣慈醫院一處，已收容傷者三十五名，其中男子佔二十七人，女子八人。此外尙有重傷者二十人，因傷而死者五人。</p>
<p>這樣看來，平均每日至少有上海同胞兩人，犧牲於吉普輪下。但是，上海的醫院不止「廣慈」一家，「吉普」殺人也不限於上海一地，除了本市以外，廣州，南京，北平，天津……都成了他們橫行的區域，肇事數字，並不弱於本市。</p>
<p>每日兩人，應該加上幾倍？或者幾十倍？可惜一時不易獲得準確的統計。不過，就拿最低的十倍計算罷，吉普卡一年之中，至少可以破壞七百三十個家庭的幸福！</p>
<h3>吉普自白</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>我是吉普，綽號原子老虎，生長在戰時的美國，今年五歲。昔日奔走沙塲，衝鋒殺敵，今日橫衝直撞，通行無阻。我們不知什麽是照會。我們的凜凜威風就是照會，我們主人的帽子衣服就是照會，我們主人的卡片簽字就是照會。</p>
<p>我們沒有讓人的習慣，我們飛速前進時，像疾風如閃電，行人車馬，只要見到我們遠遠的有個影子，就會馬上當心讓開，不然的話，出了事，流了血，他們自己也知道這是活該！</p>
<p>我的主人有的是胆量，他帶着我衝過紅燈，越過人行道，闖毀過大樹，衝壞過墙壁。結束了一些小性命，對於我們，是家常便飯。死了人，主人向來是不管的，他開足馬力，把我帶回到「部」里去，天不知，人不曉，就是曉得了，有何辦法？至於報上的攻擊，社會的實屬，我的主人說：「攻擊由他攻擊，快車我自開之」！我們一直是逍遙自在到處肇禍，理雖缺，而氣常壯！</p>
<p>我是吉普，我是原子老虎，行人軍馬，快些讓開，倘敢抗命，與虎相撞，則不管男女老幼，槪作自殺論。市民，幸勿河漢斯言！</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 戈枕</p>
<p>最近某報廣吿欄載：某公館擬徵「女性奶媽」一名，不免令人捧腹！難道世界上還有「性奶媽」不成？</p>
<p>如果有，那一定別有所指，，庸愚如我，固無法想像也。</p>
<p>廣吿文字，難免「錦上添花」，「架床疊屋」之病。司空見慣，不必大驚小怪。上舉一例，原亦不足爲訓。</p>
<p>不過，讀讀新聞，却也有同病相憐之事。譬如本市入秋以來，氣候寒暖失常，白喉流行了，某報便發一條新聞，末句云：「盼白喉患者速即注射預防針」。</p>
<p>華北巨奸，有的是錢，所以在死刑執行之前還大登廣吿，檢舉『小奸」何承焯，而且說，不這樣檢舉一下，「死不瞑目」。</p>
<p>蘇州小奸在押解到北站的時候，向月台上的圍觀者散發印刷品，內容據說是「全國卅萬無吿兒童敬致全國長官父老書」。不說內容，單就「全國」二字看去，就已經令人生奇妙之感！是不是「卅萬無吿兒童」就包括得了「全國」？更何祝「卅萬無告兒童」未必自行執筆呢？漢奸捉刀，徒見其心勞日絀而已！</p>
<h3>商人之家</h3>
<p>— 章甫</p>
<p>我有一個親戚，他們家庭的生活非常有趣，他們一家幾個人物更有趣，這樣有趣的家庭在中國也許很少，在世界上恐怕也很少，現在我且把他們一家有趣的生活和事情寫下來。</p>
<p>這一個家庭里共有三個主腦人物，就是父親，母親，大哥哥。父親和大哥哥是典型的商人，這種典型眞可說是典型得丁怪怪的了；他們凡做一件事，或是買進一樣貨物，都得商業化；就是說，不論任何一件事，他們都得看成一筆交易，正和市塲上談買賣一樣，多少得戴一點帽子，或賺一點佣錢。雖說是父子之間，但他們也是不管的。自從他倆把市塲上的商業手腕搬演到家庭里之後，這位做管理家政的母親，也就很快的受了薰陶而變成了典型的商業化的主婦了。於是，他們夫妻間，父子和母子間，有趣的家庭生活就這樣開始着：</p>
<p>父親是在銀行里辦事的，大哥哥是在市塲上工作的，當父親在銀行里打電話去要兒子買進一些股票的時候，兒子就毫不客氣的和對付普通顧客一樣的戴父親一筆帽子，有時候遇到行情上落大，甚至戴得『辣手』一點也說不定。但當兒子缺少頭寸，打電話到銀行里去向父親掉時，父親也就毫不客氣的提高拆息，照樣賺他一票，偶然遇到兒子特別急需的時候，父親也就乘機『辣手』起來，非三角股洋不放。</p>
<p>當父親和大哥哥拖欠了母親的月規錢時，母親也毫不氣親的要依高拆息利盤利的照算，而且約定期限一到，決無拖欠；但他們也從來未曾拆爛汚，因爲他們最講信用——和市塲上談交易一樣的保守信用，他們寗可在事前討價還價的爭爭吵吵，一經『交易』協定，必得毫無異議的履行諾言，雖然，他們之間是親如夫妻父母子女骨肉關係。</p>
<p>你想這一個家庭不是太有趣了嗎？</p>

<h3>「美髯公」于右老</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>走到陝西三原縣，留意街道兩旁，機關，學校，商店，寺廟的匾額招脾，必定使你驚訝：上面的題字，差不多出於一個人的手筆，這個人便是監察院長于右任先生。</p>
<p>雖然你沒有見到過于院長，但是從任何一張有于先生參加在內的團體攝影裏面，不難將他指認出來，因爲于院長是名聞全國的「美髯公」，額頰底下有一把大鬍子，長幾飄似活神仙。</p>
<p>辦報起家</p>
<p>于先生不祇是一位政治家，書法家，並且是報人出身，遜淸末葉，他在上海主持神州日報社。他曾主辦「民呼報」，向當時的民衆鼓吹革命思想。竟被查禁，于氏並不氣餒，續辦「民吁報」，主張見解，一仍舊買，復遭禁止，于氏又改辦「民立報」，並兼主筆，黨國元老邵力子先生和已故葉楚傖先生，都曾供職該報。</p>
<p>他的書法，初宗北魏，中年喜習行書，晚歲專攻章草，字如籠蛇飛舞，乍看似頗率易，細察筆筆神奇，可見功力深到。于先生對於字的結構，最爲致意，不論古今名手，一鈎半　，他認爲已臻神化的，必定加以摹描。孫總理親署的孫文兩字，和先烈黃興自書的興字，于氏認爲神妙絕倫，曾經屢番鈎描。他替人所書的書軸，多半蓋用兩顆專鈴，一爲「啼笑乾坤一杜鵑」，其一爲「半哭半笑食主」。于氏能詩，著有「右任詩存」一種，不過近年却難得看到他的作品。</p>
<p>于院長有收藏古玩之好，私邸中開有專室，用作堆藏，公餘之暇，「美髯公」常處身其中，摩挲不倦，引爲樂事。</p>
<p>辣椒尤魚</p>
<p>于氏愛吃辣椒，每餐不離。據說他的故鄕三原縣右一家「明德亭」飯館，有一拿手好菜爲「辣椒偎尤魚」，烹調得法，于氏認爲可口，讚美不絕，特地題贈『名廚師張榮』，後來被製爲匾額，懸在大門上，作爲招徠客人的廣吿。</p>
<p>于氏任監察院長職，前後已有十餘年，最近會奉派往新疆，爲省政府改組就職典禮中的監警大員。同時他更身居各地淸查團的首領，統率摩下的「打虎將」，分赴各地，澈查接收的賬册，使那些「刧搜大員」，爲之寢夢不安。我們希望于老先生拿出子歲創辦「民立」，「民吁」，「民呼」報，和當民國四年，入陝西組織靖國軍，討伐袁世凱的勇氣與精神，打死幾隻罪證確　的「老虎」，爲人民除害，爲政府奮鬥威信，爲國家保持幾分尊嚴！</p>

<h3>The Peace Negotiation Situation Takes an Unexpected Turn; Ambassador Ma Proposes a Limited Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 7th] National Assembly Secretary-General Shao Lizi stated today that the new ceasefire proposal is for a limited time, and within the ceasefire period, there will be ample time for peaceful negotiations to reach completion. Political Participation Council Secretary-General Lei Zhen held the same view as observers, stating that new developments in the peace negotiations should occur within two or three days. Furthermore, according to Shao Lizi, the new proposal is related to the CCP's request that the government cease its offensive against Zhangjiakou. When asked if the government had agreed to this new proposal, Shao smiled and replied that he believed so. He also said that the CCP's attitude towards the new proposal is of great importance to China's peace and hoped that the National Assembly could be held as scheduled on November 12th, but it may be postponed again. He hoped that representatives from all parties could participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] After careful study, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart made a final effort for peace negotiations and repeatedly consulted with the Chairman before definitively proposing the new suggestion. Spokespersons for both the US Embassy and the Communist Party delegation kept silent about the contents of the suggestion and did not disclose them. However, based on the reporter's contact with various parties today, the attitudes of all parties were more optimistic than in previous days. Today, a certain evening newspaper here published several speculations on the suggestion as follows: (1) The government will immediately order a halt to the attack on Zhangjiakou; (2) The Communist Party will immediately order a halt to the attack on Baoding; (3) The Communist Party will immediately participate in the discussions of the Three-Person Committee and the Five-Person Committee after the ceasefire order is issued; (4) A limited ceasefire will still be adopted, lasting at least ten days and at most half a month; (5) The National Assembly convocation order will not be issued until the KMT and the CCP reach an agreement. Some people believe that these speculations are indeed plausible. When the reporter inquired with the Communist Party spokesperson, he still refused to answer yes or no, only saying that a ceasefire is the most important thing and that negotiations cannot take place without a focal point. However, the current anxiety is that everything is awaiting Zhou Enlai's response. After Zhou's reply arrives in Nanjing, instructions from Yan'an will also arrive soon. If agreed, Zhou can immediately return to Nanjing from Shanghai and immediately convene the "Three" and "Five" meetings to discuss and decide on all issues. Based on this, the gloomy situation of the past few days seems to have taken a turn for the better. Furthermore, there was very little contact between the parties today. In the morning at 10 o'clock, Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, went to visit at the invitation of Ambassador Stuart. It was heard that he was told about the contents of the new proposal and hoped that Liang could assist in the progress of this peaceful situation, asking him to forward a letter to Zhou Enlai, urging Zhou to return to Nanjing. After discussing with him, Liang went to Meilan New Village to visit Dong Biwu and had a sincere conversation, and attended the lunch hosted by Soviet Ambassador Petrov. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, Fu Jingbo, a personal advisor to Ambassador Stuart, visited Liang Shuming again at the Democratic League to hear about the meeting between the CCP and Liang. The situation of all parties today seemed calm. Special Envoy Marshall and his wife took an autumn outing and picnicked at Linggu Temple in the autumn sun. Dong Biwu also took a trip to Yanziji in the afternoon. Shao Lizi and his wife went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the Pingju opera performance by the Xiasheng Troupe.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing, 7th] It is noteworthy that when General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart held an important meeting with Chairman Chiang yesterday, Ambassador Stuart acted as Marshall's translator in order to strictly maintain secrecy. The diplomatic community attaches great importance to the fact that after yesterday's secret meeting, Ambassador Stuart immediately met with Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan and sent a special envoy to deliver the conditions to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] After the National Government Memorial Week on the 7th, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Peng Xuepei, and others had an exchange of views in the conference room, reviewing the current situation. However, the new suggestion of Ambassador Marshall and Stuart was not mentioned.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Since the news of Special Envoy Ma and Ambassador Stuart's new proposal spread, the prospects for peace seem to have increased by a glimmer of light. However, according to Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesperson in this city, the CCP has not yet received this new proposal and only learned from the newspapers that the content is a ten-day ceasefire. What the CCP hopes for is a ceasefire and the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If they are unwilling to have a ceasefire and only talk about a truce, then during this truce period, they will only want to mobilize troops to prepare for another attack. Chen said that if the government insisted on convening the National Assembly under such circumstances, the situation of division would be established, and it would not be impossible for the CCP to convene a "People's Congress" and establish a government. When the reporter asked for his opinion on the proposal for resolving national affairs published by Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party some time ago, Chen said that Zhang's proposal had two main points: one was a ceasefire, and the other was not only to reorganize the government but also to reorganize the Executive Yuan. These two points were definitely unacceptable to the government because Zhang's opinions were sometimes even more active than the CCP's when the Political Consultative Conference was held. Chen finally emphasized that the turning point in the situation lies only in a ceasefire; without a ceasefire, everything is in vain.</p>

Once the delegation completes its two-and-a-half-month visit in China, it will submit recommendations to the British government, and these recommendations can also be used by the various units of the British Commonwealth. Regarding the navigation of British merchants in the coastal and Yangtze River areas of China, Bowes said that he has instructed Milburn to represent Britain in consulting with the Chinese government. All matters related to this navigation will be handled by Milburn. Bowes also praised China as a "vast and extraordinary country." He also said that the delegation will fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 8th. As Bowes is the spokesperson for the delegation, he plans to visit Nanjing on Double Ten Day. The other members of the delegation will go to Nanjing after Double Ten Day. The delegation's itinerary in China will extend to Guangzhou, Kunming, Hankou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Jinan, Beiping, and Taiwan, and they also plan to visit Northeast China and Dalian, but it is not known whether this is possible. The delegation does not intend to visit Japan, but after visiting several cities in China and returning to Shanghai, it plans to come and formally visit Hong Kong and discuss the economic and trade issues of Hong Kong with Governor Yang Muqi and local business leaders.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Fourth Joint Treasury Work Conference; Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions Urging Deep Recognition of Difficult Times and Careful Review</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Fourth Joint Treasury's branch work conference opened this morning in Nanjing. Chairman Chiang issued the following special instructions: "The establishment of the Fourth Joint Treasury and its branches in the early stages of the War of Resistance was aimed at concentrating the strength of the four banks and two bureaus and unifying their actions to assist the government in implementing financial policies and consolidating the wartime economy. Over the past eight years, efforts in this direction have yielded considerable results. Although victory has been achieved for a year, looking at the country, the wounds of the war have not yet healed. The countryside has suffered extensive damage, and industrial and commercial enterprises are even more dilapidated. The difficulties faced by the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as the abnormal and deviant dangers that have arisen in the economic sector, are even more serious than during the war. However, China has abundant resources, fertile land, and a large workforce. If the national financial institutions can respond effectively, manage them properly, promote private capital, and help it grow and flourish, the post-war economic recovery can be achieved in a matter of days. This is the greatest responsibility of the Fourth Joint Treasury in the future. All internal and external personnel must recognize and deeply understand the enormity of the task. During this conference, they must carefully review past experiences, learn from them, correct deviations, address shortcomings, formulate effective plans, and earnestly implement them to build on past achievements and create new ones. Great expectations are placed on this."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petition delegation suggested to the authorities in Nanjing that factory real estate and machinery should also be used as collateral for loans. According to a responsible person from the Fourth Joint Treasury, using machinery as collateral may be feasible, but using real estate as collateral is unlikely due to various reasons. Furthermore, the Fourth Joint Treasury's board meeting this week will not be held due to the Double Tenth Festival. The Shanghai petition delegation's suggestions will also be postponed until next week for discussion.</p>
<h3>Temporary Management Measures for Yarn and Cloth Exports to South China; Ministry of Economic Affairs Instructs the Customs Administration to Implement on a Trial Basis</h3>

<p>Temporary Management Measures for Yarn and Cloth Exports to South China: (1) In order to stabilize domestic yarn and cloth prices and curb the smuggling of yarn and cloth through various ports in South China, the government has tasked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to organize a Business Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Spinning Management Committee") and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to temporarily manage the exports. (2) Manufacturers in South China and other regions with legitimate needs for yarn and cloth who ship yarn and cloth from Shanghai to various ports in Guangdong and Fujian must apply to the Spinning Management Committee for allocation after the selling manufacturer certifies the type and quantity. Upon approval, the Spinning Management Committee will issue an export license, which will be reported to the designated customs office for export. (3) If merchants in ports other than Shanghai apply to purchase and transport yarn and cloth to various parts of South China, the same procedure shall be followed. The implementation locations and timing will be announced separately. (4) After the yarn and cloth arrive at various ports in Guangdong and Fujian, the export license must be submitted to the local customs office for inspection. (5) Yarn and cloth delivered to various ports in Guangdong and Fujian are limited to use in the local area or the province and cannot be applied for re-export to Hong Kong, Macau, and various parts of Southeast Asia. (6) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to South China: (1) The Spinning Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") has formulated these rules to handle matters related to the management of yarn and cloth exports to South China. (2) Manufacturers applying for allocation of yarn and cloth exports to South China must submit an application form for yarn and cloth exports to South China, along with samples, to the Committee or its designated affiliated agencies for review. (3) Applicants must be members of industry associations, have previously engaged in this type of business, and have been certified by the local chamber of commerce as having legitimate needs. (4) The monthly quantity of yarn and cloth allowed for export to South China shall be determined based on the domestic sales and import figures of yarn and cloth in various parts of South China in 1936 and 1937, calculated according to the ratio between the current total domestic yarn and cloth production and the total domestic yarn and cloth production before the war. (5) The monthly quantity of cotton yarn allowed for export shall be allocated by the Committee proportionally based on the number of spindles in each yarn mill. If Factory A's products do not have South China customers this month and do not need to be exported, its allocated export quota shall be withdrawn by the Committee and reallocated to Factory B, which has a greater need. (6) The monthly quantity of cotton cloth allowed for export shall be determined by the Committee based on the production situation of each textile printing and dyeing factory and the overall supply and demand situation in the market. (7) Manufacturers must report to customs for export within ten days from the date of obtaining the export license. The export license shall not be transferred privately. If discovered, the license will be invalidated, and all rights of the manufacturer will be revoked. (8) These rules shall be promulgated after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Indictment of Traitor Zhou Fohai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The investigation of the arch-traitor Zhou Fohai has been concluded. The prosecutor of the Capital High Court has filed a public prosecution. The original text of the indictment is as follows:</p>
<p>Defendant Zhou Fohai, male, 50 years old, native of Yuanling County, Hunan Province, former Deputy President of the Puppet Executive Yuan, Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, and Puppet Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality. The above-named defendant, in the case of treason numbered 782 in the 35th year of the Republic of China, has been investigated and concluded, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable legal provisions are described as follows:</p>
<p>Countless Treacherous Acts</p>
<p>(1) Facts of the Crime: Zhou Fohai was originally a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, serving as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, Minister of Mass Training of the Central Government, and Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Central Government. In 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy's forces were rampant. During the Battle of Shanghai, our National Government decided on a long-term war of resistance. However, the traitor Wang Zhaoming, with the intention of violating the central government's established national policy, conspired with Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, and Gao Zongwu to secretly advocate for peace negotiations. After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the government moved west, their efforts to promote peace became even more active. Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu first secretly went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic plan for humiliating and surrendering peace with Izumihara Akira and Imai Takeo, representatives of the Japanese military. They then flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing, secretly presenting the plan to Wang, who approved the enemy's plan and secretly advocated for peace. Zhou Fohai followed closely, participating in the matter from beginning to end. At the end of 1938, he accompanied Wang to Hanoi, Vietnam, where Wang drafted a telegram advocating peace, which was handed over to Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo to be published in Hong Kong. This echoed the statement issued by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, hoping to confuse the public and shake the decision to resist Japan. On April 12, 1939, he went to Shanghai with Mei Siping to gather party members to promote the peace movement. On May 5 of the same year, he accompanied Wang to Tokyo, Japan, with Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, Zhou Longxiang, and others, to secretly discuss peace terms with the enemy leaders. After returning to China, he used the slogan of "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction" to convene the Sixth National Congress of the Puppet Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai and issued a declaration. Zhou Fohai was elected as a Standing Committee member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee. Together with Mei Siping, Lin Baisheng, Zhou Longxiang, and Japanese representatives Izumihara Akira and Sugiyama, they discussed the "Draft of the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations." Subsequently, he attended the Qingdao Conference to discuss the reorganization of the two puppet governments, "Provisional" and "Reformed." After the agreement was reached, on March 30, 1940, in the manner of the National Government returning to the capital, the puppet National Government was jointly established in Nanjing, and a declaration was issued stating that all laws, regulations, treaties, and agreements of our National Government were invalid. At that time, Wang served as the puppet chairman, and Zhou Fohai served as the puppet minister of finance, and successively concurrently served as the director of the puppet Central Finance Committee, the legal review member and secretary-general of the puppet Central Political Committee, the member of the puppet Military Committee, the vice president of the puppet Executive Yuan, the president of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, the commander of the puppet Tax Police Corps, the member and secretary-general of the puppet Supreme National Defense Conference, the chairman of the Enemy and Puppet Management Committee, the chairman of the puppet Materials Control Review Committee, the vice chairman of the puppet Military Committee, and the puppet Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality and concurrent puppet Shanghai Security Commander, and the warden of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, wielding military, political, and economic power, and was deeply trusted by Wang. During his tenure in the puppet government, he followed the enemy's will, issued puppet currency indiscriminately, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials to increase the enemy's strength for aggression. On November 30, 1940, he formally signed the "Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations" with the Japanese in Nanjing, allowing the Japanese to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, station fleets in our country's waters, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued the "Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo," recognizing "Manchukuo" and undermining the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese and, on January 9, 1943, declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet National Government and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese. He also visited puppet "Manchukuo" as a puppet special envoy, using it to curry favor with the enemy. Countless treacherous acts cannot be enumerated. After the Japanese surrendered, he was arrested and investigated by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and brought to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>The Evidence of the Crime is Extremely Solid</p>
<p>(2) Evidence and Applicable Legal Provisions: The defendant Zhou Fohai in this case colluded with the enemy with Wang Zhaoming, secretly negotiated peace, and jointly organized the puppet National Government. He successively held the aforementioned important puppet positions, issued orders under the protection of the Japanese, and resisted the central government. During his tenure in the puppet government, he indiscriminately issued puppet currency, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials to increase the enemy's strength for aggression. He himself admitted this without hesitation. Furthermore, the puppet National Government Gazette and the puppet Finance Gazette, which were investigated in this case, contain various official documents issued by the defendant in his capacity as the puppet Minister of Finance, which can be used as evidence. As for how he planned peace, accompanied Wang to Hanoi and then to Hong Kong to send a telegram advocating peace, to echo the peace statement of the Japanese leader Kintetsu Fumi; how he went to Japan to visit the enemy's leading figures to discuss the organization of the puppet government; and how, after returning to China, he participated in the Sixth National Congress of the Puppet Kuomintang, discussed the draft peace treaty with the Japanese, advocated peaceful fallacies, and obstructed the national policy of resistance; how he traveled to Qingdao and Shanghai to negotiate the establishment of the puppet government, betrayed the central government, and undermined the overall war of resistance; how he concluded the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations with the enemy, issued the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and openly recognized the puppet "Manchukuo," selling out the interests of the nation and the country; how he declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet government after the outbreak of the Pacific War, isolating our central war of resistance camp; and how he visited the puppet "Manchukuo" to curry favor with the enemy. He also confessed to each of these matters in detail, which are consistent with Hai Siping's statement in another case. Furthermore, the commemorative album of the return to the capital of the puppet National Government (as well as various documents on peace, anti-communism, and national construction) investigated in this case can be used as reference. This is solid evidence of his collusion with the Japanese, violation of national policy, organization of the puppet government, and betrayal of the central government.</p>
<p>The Defense Is Not Worth Refuting</p>
<p>As for the defendant's defense, it is nothing more than: (1) Organizing the puppet government to try to explore peace, shake the enemy's morale, reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas, and that organizing the puppet government in the occupied areas had no impact on the war of resistance camp; (2) The defendant once entrusted someone to surrender to the central government in the winter of 1942, providing military intelligence, establishing radio stations, deploying military affairs, coordinating the national army's counterattack, rescuing central underground workers, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas; (3) After the victory, the defendant was appointed as the commander of the Shanghai Action Corps,恪恪遵 central government's will, responsible for maintaining the security of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, preventing traitors and puppets, and stabilizing people's hearts. When the national army and central government takeover personnel arrived in Shanghai one after another, he handed over all the military and police under his command to the central government for takeover, which was not without merit. However, regarding the first point, long-term resistance was the unanimous and firm proposition of our entire country, both government and people. The defendant and Wang Zhaoming deliberately violated the established national policy of the central government and arbitrarily negotiated peace with the Japanese, which was already an act of betrayal. Moreover, he followed the enemy's will to organize a puppet National Government, seize the situation in the southeast, and form a separatist situation. How profound was its impact on the people's psychology and international opinion? Now, to still say that it was to explore peace and did not hinder the war of resistance, is this not a cover-up and self-deception? As for all the false policies implemented by the puppet government in the occupied areas, such as recruiting puppet troops, selling opium publicly, indiscriminately issuing puppet currency, plundering materials, enslaving young people, and using rural cleansing to implement blockades, none of these were not harmful to the country and the people. To say that it was to save the people and relieve suffering is even more turning black into white and reversing right and wrong. Furthermore, since the establishment of the puppet government, training puppet troops has not only consolidated the enemy's rear but also helped the enemy attack our defense lines, which has caused the enemy's flames to become more intense and aggression more violent. The defendant's so-called shaking the enemy's morale has, in fact, added wings to the enemy's tiger with the help of the enemy's troops, which is contrary to his intention. Regarding the second point, the defendant said that in the winter of 1942, he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government. Even if he only spoke empty words, it is not enough to believe deeply. Even if it is not false, the defendant was clearly wanted by the Procuratorate of the Supreme Court as early as November 4, 1939. He did not voluntarily surrender and be tried before the crime was discovered. This does not meet the requirements of surrender, so it cannot be used as a reason to seek leniency. As for rescuing underground workers, secretly reporting enemy intelligence, contacting the national army, preparing for a counterattack, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, even if these things were true, it was only after the outbreak of the Pacific War that the international situation was clearly unfavorable to the enemy. Anyone with a little international common sense could easily predict the outcome. The defendant showed a tendency to the central government and took these actions because he hoped to preserve himself and leave room for retreat. How can he hope to be forgiven by doing this? Regarding the third point, at that time, the defendant, in the area of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, had supervised his troops to jointly maintain local security with the enemy troops and hand over all military and police forces. The Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission did state in the transfer document that this was true. However, the former, his maintenance of security, was only when he was at the end of his rope, trying to cover up his past mistakes. The latter, handing over military power, was under the strict supervision of our advancing troops, so he had no choice but to submit. What merit is there to speak of?</p>
<p>In summary, all of the above defenses are nothing more than various attempts to embellish his words in the hope of reducing or eliminating his guilt, and none of them are acceptable. The defendant's actions constitute a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed, and it is respectfully requested that a legal trial be conducted.</p>
<h3>Luo Junqiang's Rebellious Heart: Willing to Serve the Enemy, A Traitorous Crime Bringing Disaster to the Country and People</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Telegraph, 7th] The indictment of the traitor Luo Junqiang was drafted by Prosecutor Wang Wenzhun. It recounts that the traitor Luo fled to Hong Kong in February of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], went to Shanghai in August to participate in the "Reformed" puppet government, and on March 30th of the 29th year [1940], when the puppet government returned to the capital [Nanjing], he served as the Chairman of the Frontier Affairs Committee. In the 31st year [1942], he served as the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration; in the spring of the 33rd year [1944], he served as the Puppet Governor of Anhui Province and concurrently as the Director of the Bengbu Pacification Headquarters. Later, he co-founded the Tax Police School with the traitor Zhou Fohai, serving concurrently as the Director of Education. He also founded the Tax Police Corps, serving as both the Commander and Deputy Commander, as well as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. During his tenure in these various puppet positions, he colluded with the traitor Zhou, betrayed the country to serve the enemy, oppressed the people, disrupted finances, plundered materials to aid the enemy, and established private armed forces, all of which are substantiated. Moreover, his article "Matters Concerning Welcoming Japanese Members of the House of Representatives to China," written at the end of the 29th year [1940] in his capacity as a member of the "East Asia League China Comrades Association," vividly demonstrates his willingness to serve the enemy and harm the country. Therefore, although the traitor Luo argued that his assumption of puppet positions was merely due to "personal emotional relations with Zhou Fohai and that he had no intention of harming the people or resisting his own country," this is insufficient to conceal the obvious and documented facts of his crimes. As for his false claim that "he was in contact with the Central Government before and after the victory and conducted subversive work, contributing to the takeover," it is entirely based on empty words without any evidence. Even if there were evidence, it would only be opportunistic and would not reduce his deserved punishment. Considering his actions, he has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he is being prosecuted.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcome to the British Commercial Delegation and Mrs. Cripps</h3>
<p>The British Commercial Delegation will arrive in Shanghai by plane today. At the same time, Mrs. Cripps, Chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund, along with her daughter, will also arrive in the capital by special plane tomorrow. Although the missions and tasks of the Commercial Delegation and Mrs. Cripps are different, they both represent the concern of our wartime allies for us. We would like to express our sincere welcome to them.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Britain has always been close. This traditional relationship has been further solidified by this war of resistance against aggression. At a time when human civilization felt the most serious threat, it was Britain that independently resisted the Nazi flames in Europe. When all of Europe was swept away by darkness, it was only Britain that illuminated the hearts of people in Europe and even around the world. The retreat of the Dunkirk army and the Battle of Britain were matters of concern to all people with a sense of justice around the world. The arduous struggle of the British military and civilians led to the failure of Göring and his invincible air force, which was a harbinger of the collapse of the Nazis. We Chinese people understand all this most clearly, because China has faced much the same in the Far East. We Chinese people, during the eight years of war, also bravely resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists in East Asia for the first four years, much like the British people. The people of China and Britain naturally understand each other best in this situation. What particularly inspires us is the concern of the British United Aid to China Fund, led by Mrs. Cripps, for the Chinese people. Even when the war in Europe was raging, they still sent us material assistance from time to time. The Chinese people will always be grateful for this expression of true affection and will never forget it. We know that Britain itself was undergoing an unprecedented struggle at the time, but it was still able to take care of us from time to time. This spirit of friendship moves us. This is truly the highest expression of human love. And all of this was only possible under the leadership and advocacy of Mrs. Cripps. We would like to express our deep gratitude to this friend of China.</p>
<p>However, relations between nations are not entirely built on humanitarian foundations. That is why we are particularly pleased with the arrival of the British Commercial Delegation. The economic relationship between China and Britain has always been close. Many of the tall buildings standing in Shanghai, the center of Chinese industry and commerce, have been dedicated to promoting the economic relationship between China and Britain. In the past two or three decades, the economic relationship between China and Britain has been affected by the rise of Japan. Britain's original position as the leader in China's international trade was eventually seized by Japan. Now that Japan has been defeated and the world situation is new, the British Commercial Delegation's arrival at this time will, we believe, be of great benefit to promoting the economic relationship between China and Britain, especially in trade relations. As the delegation arrives, we would like to briefly express our views on Sino-British trade relations.</p>
<p>First, since the victory a year ago, China's political situation has not yet stabilized, resulting in traffic congestion and a major impact on foreign trade. At present, China's foreign trade is showing abnormal development. This is an unavoidable phenomenon when the post-war order has not yet returned to normal. Under the current circumstances, we see a large number of unnecessary, often luxury, imports, while export trade has not yet regained its proper position. According to figures released by the London Foreign Trade Authority, between August of last year and March of this year, the value of British exports to China was 1.04 million pounds, while the value of imports from China during the same period was only 180,000 pounds, with Britain exporting 960,000 pounds more than it imported from China. In China, this means that we had a trade deficit of 960,000 pounds with Britain during these six months. Although this figure is not very alarming, it does indicate that Sino-British trade has not yet returned to normal. How to normalize Sino-British trade is not a simple matter, but it is a major issue for the Commercial Delegation.</p>
<p>Second, China has resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists for the longest time and suffered the deepest wounds. Now that the war is over, it is eager to rebuild the country. Therefore, in our national economic life in the future, we cannot allow the previous laissez-faire freedom. Although we do not advocate adopting a planned economy, we cannot but have a considerable plan. The past era is past and will never return. At this time, it is beneficial to both parties to review the future of Sino-British trade. Because the commercial relationship between China and Britain is relatively long-standing, the Chinese people have a good understanding of British goods. Good quality, durability, and reliability represent the general Chinese people's perception of British goods. Therefore, the Chinese people are very willing to see Sino-British trade relations return to their former prosperity. However, China will embark on the road of national construction in the future, and we hope that Britain's exports to China can be more inclined to industrial tools such as machinery, to assist in our country's reconstruction. This will not only be of great benefit to China's national construction, but also make China's industry prosperous, increase purchasing power, and establish a permanent and good foundation for Sino-British relations.</p>
<p>Third, since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty in 1945, it was originally scheduled to conclude a Sino-British commercial treaty within six months, but due to the war at that time, and then due to the return of the National Government to the capital and other reasons, it was repeatedly delayed. Now that the environment has changed, and it is heard that the Sino-American commercial treaty has also been drafted, this is the time to start the signing of the Sino-British commercial treaty, to lay the foundation for rebuilding trade with China. As for other aspects related to Sino-British trade, the delegation will gain much from observing the major cities of China. However, there is one point that may be worth mentioning at this time, that is, the methods used by British businesses in China or for China should be reformed as necessary due to changes in the times. The comprador class has been deeply involved in China's foreign trade in the past, but it has a very bad impression in the minds of the Chinese people. If future Sino-British trade still has to go through these notorious comprador systems, it will not be well received by the Chinese people. This era is past, and we must sincerely welcome the arrival of the new era.</p>
<p>We wish Mrs. Cripps a pleasant stay and good health! We wish all members of the British Commercial Delegation a pleasant stay and good health!</p>
<h3>Where is Chinese Business Going?</h3>
<p>The Shanghai market is undoubtedly dominated by wholesale businesses. Their customers are from the neighborhoods nearby and from provinces far away. Their goods encompass the world and local products. All kinds of tea parties, associations, and markets are their places of activity. Among them, the oldest can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty, and the most powerful have branches in Southeast Asia, Japan, and other places, or even have their own warehouses, workshops, factories, and financial institutions. In short, these wholesale businesses are the backbone of Shanghai's commerce.</p>
<p>However, these core members are only a minority. Don't most businesses simply take in on the left and put out on the right? In terms of imports, they have never directly ordered goods from abroad. In terms of exports, they have never directly sourced goods from the interior. Their scope of activity is simply to move existing materials around locally, making a profit in the process. Times have changed, and there is much antipathy towards this class of middlemen. First, the more intermediaries, the higher the cost, which fuels rising prices. Second, speculation and hoarding are created by this situation. Third, they are purely profit-takers, not producers. The modern cooperative system is designed to target these middlemen. The currently expanding direct distribution and rationing systems also aim to bypass these middlemen. These new systems are still in their infancy, but their potential cannot be underestimated. Those middlemen should already be feeling a considerable threat.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples: When textile factories opened yarn sales, yarn brokers were always left out in the cold, unable to get any scraps, leading to complaints. The Taiwan Sugar Company once bypassed sugar merchants and directly distributed and sold to retail stores, causing a great uproar. Several vegetable cooperatives were organized in western and southern Shanghai, which repeatedly clashed with merchants. The Fuel Management Committee monopolized the coal trade, and coal merchants had to rely on firewood, charcoal, and coal briquettes to keep their businesses afloat. The Social Affairs Bureau's rice distribution targeted retail rice stores. When the Rice Price Review Committee was not established, the general rice stores were at a loss when they could not purchase white rice. Now edible oil is also going to be directly distributed. Direct transactions of wheat (between merchants) are strictly prohibited. Since the establishment of the China Silk Corporation and the large-scale tea companies, the original silk and tea merchants have also been overshadowed. During the livestock market period, the original pig merchants and pig stalls were even closed together. In light of this, the major types of commerce have already encountered problems due to the trend of the times.</p>
<p>We know that manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers each have their own tasks and functions. It is impossible to completely eliminate any part of them. However, in this time of economic crisis, it is equally impossible to return to the laissez-faire state of before the war. Don't we see that the regulatory policies of countries like Britain and the United States have not been completely abandoned to this day? Today, our country's foreign exchange is controlled, and exports are subject to considerable restrictions. In addition, the lack of materials and high prices have forced the government to adopt flat-price measures such as rationing. On the one hand, various consumer cooperatives are also being widely promoted. These facilities are somewhat in conflict with the interests of general businesses. However, due to the trend of the times, it cannot be avoided, at least for a considerable period. Therefore, in order to maintain their original business and take care of the business and livelihoods of this large group of people, they must adapt to this trend and actively make remedies and innovations to adapt to this new environment. If they do not do this, it would be tragic to simply listen to fate and be eliminated. Even seeking sympathy by going against history will not help.</p>

<h3>Most County Magistrate Handover Procedures Unfinished; Zhejiang Provincial Government Determined to Rectify; Listed as Central Task, Representatives Dispatched to Supervise and Urge</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou Telegraph, 7th] The matters of appointment and removal of county magistrates in Zhejiang Province have been very frequent, which has attracted attention from all parties. According to this newspaper's reporter's investigation, as of the end of September this year, there were a total of 285 cases, but only 121 have been settled. The remaining 164 are still pending. Among these 164 unfinished cases, in addition to 48 that can be settled and 26 that have not reached the prescribed deadline, the unfinished situations can be divided into five categories: (1) 44 cases have not been inspected by the successor; (2) 47 cases have begun inspection; (3) 34 cases have not completed handover due to loss of files; (4) 55 cases have incomplete handover procedures; (5) 10 cases have not been reported after inspection. Since there are so many cases of unclear handover, the people's suspicion is also increasing day by day. Therefore, the provincial government has listed this as one of the important central tasks and is determined to rectify it. It has dispatched special personnel to the counties to guide and supervise. At the same time, it has presented a list of the unfinished county magistrate handovers to Chairman Shen for approval, so that they can be completed quickly.</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Travels Tirelessly to Stabilize Grain Prices in Wujiang and Kunshan</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Telegraph, 7th] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province was originally scheduled to return to the province at 12:00 p.m. on the 6th, but in view of the fact that grain prices in the rice-producing areas adjacent to this county also affect the people's food supply on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, it is necessary to thoroughly control and assess the situation. In order to fundamentally stabilize grain prices on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, he temporarily changed his itinerary and stayed overnight in Suzhou. At 7:00 a.m. on the 7th, he, together with Xu Shiguang, the commissioner of the Second District, Da Jianhua, the magistrate of Suzhou County, and his entourage, took a car to Wujiang. In addition to strictly ordering the suppression of grain prices to be lower than those in Suzhou and Wuxi, he also convened the leaders of the county to listen to reports and gave earnest instructions. He then returned to Suzhou at noon and went to Kunshan at about 1:00 p.m., before returning to the provincial capital.</p>
<p>[Kunshan Telegraph, 7th] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, arrived in Kunshan from Suzhou at 2:00 p.m. on the 7th, accompanied by Zhou Youmin, Secretary of the Provincial Government, and others to inspect the area. The county government convened a symposium of leaders of various agencies at 3:30 p.m., where Chairman Wang gave a speech, providing detailed instructions on current important issues such as bandit suppression, land tax, and food supply. Regarding the high grain prices, he personally spoke to the responsible authorities, urging them to effectively suppress prices to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>[Wuxi Report] The grain market in this city has recently experienced a sharp fluctuation, with rice, wheat, and flour all rising in price. Among them, white rice has risen most sharply, once breaking the 70,000 mark. Flour is almost reaching 20,000 yuan, and the common people are crying out in agony. Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, upon hearing about the grain prices in Wuxi, believed that it would affect the Shanghai grain market and was deeply related to the food supply of the military and civilians. According to the report of Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food, when grain was exported from Wuxi, the local government had difficulty in levying taxes. He specially summoned Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and instructed him to quickly investigate the truth and seek countermeasures to suppress prices. After receiving the order, Wang took a car from Nanjing to Wuxi at 8:00 p.m. on the 5th. After getting off the car, he went directly to the county government and immediately summoned representatives from the county Chamber of Commerce and the grain and cloth industries to hold a discussion. Wang reported the purpose of coming to Wuxi, saying that Premier Song was very concerned about the prices in Wuxi. Recently, Shanghai has also been panicked due to rumors of the foreign exchange rate being listed at any time, causing market fluctuations. Mayor Wu reported the situation in Shanghai to the Chairman, and also mentioned that the highest rice price in Shanghai was only about 60,000 yuan, while Wuxi's price had risen beyond the 70,000 mark, which was very inappropriate. Rice prices have a great impact on society, and he hoped that everyone would work together to seek countermeasures and quickly suppress prices to benefit the people. Then, Zhao Zhangji and other representatives of the rice industry reported the reasons for the price increase. Subsequently, it was decided that the highest price should not exceed 54,000 yuan. After the discussion, Wang summarized the conclusions and drafted a telegram, which he sent to Premier Song that night for approval. Regarding the issue of land tax collection, Wang also instructed Magistrate Xu to collect all taxes before December 15 and not to delay. Wang left Wuxi for Suzhou at 2:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Restricts Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Wuxi Report] Rice and grain prices in Wuxi have recently skyrocketed. Chief of Staff Liu of the city defense department dispatched officers to thoroughly investigate the rice, grain, and flour markets. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he summoned Zhao Zhangji and Zhang Yizhong, responsible persons from the rice and grain industry, and Guo Jiliang, from the flour industry, to discuss the issue of price suppression in the auditorium of the headquarters. The responsible persons of the Rice and Grain Industry Association reported that the current goods were all from visiting merchants, and there were no local goods on the market. The current inferior goods only cost 42,000 to 43,000 yuan per stone. The talk of high rice prices was about the once high price of broken japonica rice, which reached 70,000 yuan. However, there was very little of this good, with a price but no rice. As Wuxi is a distribution center for rice and grain, if there are too many arrivals and few buyers, the price will be cheap. It is entirely a matter of supply and demand. The responsible person of the flour industry said that it would be best to summon representatives from various factories to discuss. However, according to the raw material price of 40,000 yuan, the flour price must be 16,000 hundred yuan. The factories are currently requesting that the allocation of raw materials continue in order to further reduce the flour price. Finally, after detailed discussions, it was decided that each rice and grain merchant could only store 300 bags of rice and 600 ancestors of raw materials. The price of indica rice should not exceed 40,000 yuan, the price of japonica rice should not exceed 54,000 yuan, the price of flour should not exceed 16,000 yuan, and the price of period flour should not exceed 17,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Other Suffering in Rural Areas, but Bandit Disturbances are Unbearable</h3>
<p>Suzhou County Magistrate Talks About His Inspection Tour</p>
<p>[Suzhou Report] Magistrate Da Jianhua of this county, in order to cooperate with the development of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area, personally led the chief of the military affairs section, the captain of the security team, and other local forces to inspect the various rural areas under the jurisdiction of the Yangcheng area on the 1st, including Huangdai, Xiangcheng, Nanbeiqiao, and Shiqiao. He returned to Suzhou on the evening of the 4th. This reporter visited his private residence at 6:00 p.m. on the 5th to ask about his impressions of this trip. He said: "The mission of this trip was to go deep into the rural areas to comfort the people in order to facilitate the promotion of bandit suppression work. Every time I went to a place, I would gather the local elders and hold talks with them. I asked them how the rural areas are suffering today. I was told that apart from bandit disturbances and concerns about public security, there is no other suffering. This is something that can be told to those who care about rural areas. As for the grassroots politics, as far as our inspections have reached, it is quite clear. However, I deeply feel that it is difficult to establish a sound personnel system below the township level. The reason is that the Bao-Jia chiefs have only obligations and no rights. In the future, the township heads should strengthen the propaganda work so that all people will know the importance of participating in the Bao-Jia system. When passing near Huangdai, a military affairs section chief of the New Fourth Army's pseudo-Wuxi County Magistrate Cao Jianping's unit was captured. The government intends to influence and appease Cao's unit. After the Double Tenth Festival, it was decided to inspect the various rural areas under the jurisdiction of Taihu Lake, such as the East and West Dongting Mountains, Guangfu, Mu Du, and Jinshan, and to agree with the county magistrates of the neighboring counties of Wujiang and Wuxi to meet on the border to promote comfort work."</p>
<h3>Suzhou Public Education Personnel Benefits Adjusted and Supplemented</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Report] The benefits for public education personnel in this province were previously adjusted by district starting in August, according to an order from the Executive Yuan. In the Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou districts, the basic amount was 90,000 yuan, and the salary increase was 540 times. In the Jiangsu district, the basic amount was 75,000 yuan, and the salary increase was 440 times. At that time, due to the beginning of the fiscal reform and the provincial-level finance being in a period of transition, the provincial funds were extremely insufficient. However, the provincial-level public education personnel were living in unusually difficult conditions due to the high prices at this time. The Ministry of Finance first raised and disbursed the August adjustment amount in mid-September. Now, the Ministry of Finance, because October has already arrived, intends to raise and supplement the new benefit adjustment amounts for September and October in consideration of the difficulties of the public education personnel. It is currently expediting the signing of the allocation of funds and will be disbursed soon. The provincial-level agencies and schools in Nanjing and Shanghai have been approved by the Executive Yuan through the Provincial Government to follow the benefit standards of the Nanjing and Shanghai districts starting in August. All differences for August, September, and October will also be disbursed soon.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Autumn Silkworm Harvest Not Exceeding 10,000 Loads</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou Report] This year's autumn climate was hot and humid, which affected the growth of autumn silkworms, resulting in a sharp decrease in production. According to the person in charge of the Third District Silk Industry Association, it was previously estimated that the autumn silkworms could produce 25,000 loads, but in fact, the most this autumn will be no more than 10,000 loads. Therefore, only half of the 15 billion yuan in autumn silkworm loans were used. After discussion, the association decided to use the drinking fund to purchase spring cocoons self-baked by farmers.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugees Still in Dire Straits; Relief Donations Actually Embezzled; Suzhou Account Settlement Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Report] In order to relieve the refugees in northern Jiangsu, enthusiastic people in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have successively launched disaster relief organizations and promoted fundraising activities. Suzhou was not willing to lag behind and also organized a fundraising committee in August, jointly organized by local celebrities. They successively held dance, recreational, Kun opera, football, basketball, and other fundraising programs, and also ingeniously collected various fines to replenish the relief funds. For example, the Xiansheng Temple in Lumu violated the ban and held a temple fair in the city, and the city defense headquarters detained the organizers and fined them 2.5 million yuan before releasing them. Xi Bommin, the son of the pseudo-military official Zhong Guoliang, disturbed public order at the dance party and was fined 1 million yuan to settle the matter. Therefore, the fundraising results were not bad. According to the Zhenjiang Relief Association, Suzhou ranked second only to Shanghai among the cities on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, surpassing Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places. However, the exact amount of donations has been delayed in being announced. The media has repeatedly urged for the announcement, and the local people have also been discussing it, but the organizers have always remained silent and have not responded. It was not until the 19th of last month that news was suddenly revealed that an employee named Yu Changji had embezzled more than 6 million yuan in donations and fled without a trace. Therefore, all sectors of society believed that Yu Changji had no authority to handle money and unanimously and urgently demanded that the donation income and expenditure accounts be made public to clarify the truth. The association then appointed a review committee and scheduled a meeting for the 23rd to begin the review. However, the review work did not begin on the 23rd due to unsettled accounts. It was rescheduled for the 26th. The review work still did not begin on the 26th. Only 30 million yuan in donations were remitted first. All sectors of society temporarily shifted their focus because of this, and the news about the review work has since subsided, and it is feared that it will end without a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silver Shop Closes Down; Owner and Partners Flee</h3>
<p>[Wuxi Telegraph, 7th] The Xintian Shi Silver Shop in Beimennei, this city, closed down this morning, and the owner and partners have fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Credit Tight, Market Depressed; Many Businesses in Bengbu Close Down; Totaling 55 Cases in August and September</h3>
<p>[Bengbu Report] In the past two months, large and small stores here have been affected by the flood in northern Anhui. Credit is extremely tight, and it is difficult to sell goods. The market is becoming increasingly depressed, leading to closures and shutdowns. According to reliable sources, a total of 32 shops in the urban area closed in August, including six department stores such as Dongsheng Yuan, six cloth shops such as Shen Juheng, two oil and grain shops such as Lianxing Company, three sugar, paper, and sundries shops such as Jing Yixing Ji, five leather manufacturing factories such as Guanghua Factory, one hotel such as Liansheng Apartment, one tobacco factory such as Dacheng Tobacco Factory, one chicken and duck shop such as Chen Shunxin, six salt and grain shops such as Datongxing, and one hardware shop such as Shun Ji. Twenty-three shops closed in September, including one department store such as Dahua, three grain shops such as Shuixing, four grocery stores such as Yihe, one lumber yard such as Gongyi, thirteen cloth shops such as Tongxincheng, one western medicine shop such as Shijie Pharmacy, and one burlap bag shop such as Yuan Chenghao. A total of 55 shops closed in two months, which shows the depression of the Zhapu market.</p>
<h3>Severe Losses, Difficult Recovery: Current State of the Electrical Industry in Jiangsu Province - Only 25 Power Generators are Operating</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang] Developing industry and revitalizing rural areas are the current priorities of the government's policies. Within this context, the driving force for developing industry and revitalizing rural areas is the electrical industry. However, what is the state of the electrical industry in Jiangsu? During the Anti-Japanese War, the extent of damage to all electrical enterprises was extremely severe. After the provincial government resumed operations, less than ten power plants across the province were struggling to generate electricity. Later, the Department of Reconstruction sent personnel to various locations to guide and rectify the businesses, circuits, and machinery. However, in terms of business, the rampant theft of electricity could not be eradicated, and many factories suffered from unsound personnel structures and excessive expenses. In terms of circuits, they were dilapidated from years of neglect, with losses accounting for 30% to 40% of the generated power, greatly impacting the future of the electrical industry. According to investigations by our Zhenjiang-based reporter, each kilowatt-hour of electricity requires two to three kilograms of coal, while the Songjiang Power Plant requires as much as 7.5 kilograms per kilowatt-hour, which is particularly uneconomical. However, due to the limited financial resources of local governments, none of the factories can carry out renovations according to standards. Currently, only 25 power plants within the province are operating normally, including the state-owned Qishuyan Power Plant. Furthermore, fuel is severely scarce, and various factories are frequently at risk of power outages. The provincial government is paying close attention and has contacted the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to purchase coal and coordinate the allocation of ships for transportation. The locations and names of power plants in the province that have resumed operations and those that have suspended operations, along with their power generation capacity and extent of damage, are investigated and listed below.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Director Donates Property to Repair Large Bridge</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Minhang] Zhu Yangzhong, Director of the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce, considering the Ziteitengpeng wooden bridge, located six miles from Minhang, as an important thoroughfare for merchants traveling between Shanghai and Songjiang counties, and seeing that it was nearing collapse due to years of disrepair, sold over twenty acres of fertile land he owned in Ziteiteng and Taiping townships, obtaining approximately 8 million yuan, all of which was donated for repair expenses. At 2 p.m., Zhu hosted a gathering in the assembly hall of the County Chamber of Commerce, inviting relevant township heads and local figures to discuss construction plans, with work reportedly commencing within days.</p>
<h3>Taixing Cadre Training - First Phase Begins on the 20th</h3>

<h3>Major Wuhan Swindle - Clearing of Creditors and Debts</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuhan Xianghe Lane 1.3 billion yuan swindle, which caused a sensation in Wuhan, after the ringleaders Wang Yifei, Wang Zhaomin, and Zhang Fengshi were each sentenced to seven years in prison by the local district court, is now being executed by the execution court. Due to the complexity of the case, it has not yet been finalized. Regarding the creditor and debtor aspects, they have now been cleared. Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been requested to assess the value of Wang Yifei, Zhang Fengshi, et al.'s movable and immovable property, and publicly announce the reserve price for auction. The proceeds will be distributed to the various creditors on a percentage basis. Furthermore, another protagonist in the case, Liu Hanbin, was unable to be investigated and prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office due to the escape of his accountant Yan Daohua (i.e., Yan Lin). Recently, creditors such as Zhu Yunlong discovered that Yan Lin was hiding in Wandi, Echeng, and convened several creditors to apprehend him and bring him back to Hankou, handing him over to the police for transfer to the District Court for detention.

Over 40 military and political leaders and local team representatives attended, resolving multiple important matters.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Suzhou Team Investigates in Suzhou - Inspecting Various Receiving Factories and Warehouses - Many Agencies Still Postpone Original Inventory - Scheduled to Go to Zhenjiang Today and Return to Beijing on the Double Tenth Festival</h3>

Other agencies also reported, but regarding the original inventory, they claimed that after the victory, the National Army received it first, and the agencies mostly received it from the military. The 6th was a weekly holiday, and the group decided to organize various important documents throughout the day. Starting on the 7th, they will continue to inspect the warehouses.

<h3>Meaning of Traffic Police Whistle</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of traffic order in the central district of this city, although not fully effective, it has already improved considerably. The most effective measures include designating one-way streets and prohibiting wide turns. These two things are the most practical needs and the most effective solutions. According to the situation in the past ten days, it is undeniable that considerable effort has been put into design and command. However, it is still felt that promotion is insufficient, because traffic order requires everyone to abide by it. Pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, tricycle pullers, and car drivers must all earnestly maintain order from themselves. But to achieve this effect, people of all kinds must first understand the traffic rules and the order of traffic, as well as the purpose of various facilities. I believe that the Public Works Bureau should compile concise booklets of traffic regulations, distribute them to every car driver and driver, and also distribute them to every citizen. It is also necessary to expand slogans.</p>
<p>I saw one thing in the central district. When the traffic lights at the intersection change, the police blow a whistle. As soon as the whistle blows, the vehicles start moving from a standstill. However, cars on the cross street can sometimes rush to the center of the intersection and stop next to the police. What is the reason for this? Although it is a small matter, it is worth discussing. In European and American cities, this traffic light control is not only red and green, but also a yellow one. Red means stop, green means go, and what about yellow? It means preparation. For example, during the red light, the vehicles stop, the vehicles moving are moving, and then red is followed by yellow. This is a preparation signal. Vehicles in motion must reduce speed in preparation for stopping, and vehicles at a standstill must prepare to move. When the yellow light goes off and the green light is displayed, the stopped vehicles move and the moving vehicles stop. After the green light goes out, it is still the yellow light, and after the yellow light, the red light is displayed. This method allows vehicles to have preparation time in terms of movement, so as to avoid the problems of not being able to stop in time or not being able to start immediately. In Shanghai, we only have red and green lights without a yellow light in between, which is already outdated. However, the police's intention to blow the whistle when changing the traffic lights is entirely to replace the function of this yellow light, but if it is blown inappropriately, this function will disappear. What should be done? The red light must not be changed during the time the whistle is blown. It must be blown completely, and immediately changed from red to green or from green to red. In other words, the whistle tells everyone a signal to prepare to go or prepare to stop. Not only must the police understand the purpose of blowing the whistle, but every vehicle driver must also understand its purpose. I think most people may not understand this small effect, so I specially bring it up.</p>
<p>There is another thing that is very strange. When pedestrians on the sidewalk cross the street, they should also abide by the instructions of the traffic lights and have the same actions as the vehicles in the same direction. Now pedestrians cross the street too arbitrarily. According to regulations, in major European and American cities, many places have pedestrian traffic lights. In cities without this equipment, pedestrians abide by the vehicle traffic lights. We must know that in the definition of "traffic category," pedestrians are also a type of traffic on the street and must also be included in traffic regulations.</p>
<p>The above sections are a small episode observed by the author recently. I think there are still many problems in maintaining traffic order in the central district. If it can be slowly and continuously improved, there will be good results. However, it is not enough if the municipal authorities are satisfied with this. (Yimin)</p>
<h3>General Assembly of the Peace Conference Discusses the Italian Treaty; U.S. Representative Connally Delivers Speech, Stating No Further Concessions on the Trieste Issue; Asks the Assembly to Adopt the Committee's Recommendations; Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Returns to Paris from Moscow Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (Urgent Radio): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov returned to Paris at 3:00 PM today, preparing to attend the plenary session of the Peace Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 7th (Radio): Under the chairmanship of Bevin, the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference was held this afternoon (10:00 PM Shanghai time) to discuss the Italian Treaty. Three-quarters of the semi-circular seats were empty. Besides Chairman Bevin, Bales, Vishinsky, and Maureville were also present. The delegations believed that having representatives attend the committee meetings for consultations, there was no need for more than three or four representatives to attend the plenary session. U.S. Senator Connally delivered the first speech, stating to the representatives of the Peace Conference that the United States would make no further concessions on the Trieste issue, requesting the assembly to pass the committee proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 7th] U.S. Senator Connally stated in his address to the representatives of the Peace Conference today that the proposed outline of the Free Territory of Trieste had been supported by two-thirds of the members of the Italian Political Committee. From the U.S. perspective, the Trieste agreement is a resolution and an agreement, and no part can be separated from the whole agreement. A fair resolution of the Trieste and Southern Italian border issues is key to the Peace Conference. The Free Territory of Trieste must be built on democratic principles and must be free and independent. The organization of the Free Territory must allow it to have a free life, free from external influence from any great power or group of great powers. Only the appointment of an administrative governor of the Free Territory by the Security Council can guarantee its integrity and independence. The administrative governor must have full power to fulfill these guarantees. He (the administrative governor) is not "the dictator some people claim," imposing his own or others' will on the residents. The administrative governor is responsible to the international body that maintains peace and security in the region."</p>
<p>Assembly Passes Agenda on First Day</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 6th] The plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference will begin the final stage of discussions tomorrow afternoon. At tonight's plenary session, chaired by Bevin, the procedural rules proposed by the Four Powers have been passed, so that the work of the Peace Conference can be concluded before October 15th. This method limits each representative to no more than thirty minutes of speaking time for each draft treaty. The draft Italian Treaty is scheduled for three days of discussion, and the remaining draft treaties for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland will each be discussed for one day in turn. Each discussion will begin with a general discussion, followed by a vote on each clause and the committee's amendments. Tonight, the Soviet delegation proposed that the recommendations and opinions of each committee should be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for review again, and this proposal was passed without opposition. Of the nine committees of the Peace Conference, only the Italian Economic Committee and the Military Committee were unable to conclude their work as scheduled on the 6th. The Military Committee completed its discussions this morning, while the Italian Economic Committee still needs to continue its meeting tonight.</p>
<h3>Unresolved Issues, Diplomatic War Reaches Climax, Bevin to Attend the United Nations General Assembly in Person</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 7th] The Paris Peace Conference has failed to resolve various outstanding issues and is entering its final stage today. It is expected to extend the meeting until October 15th, but by then all hopes will be dashed, and the representatives of the twenty-one nations will inevitably come with high expectations and leave disappointed. Diplomatic war follows gun warfare and has reached its climax in the Peace Conference. The representatives of the Peace Conference began their plenary session at 3:00 PM today to determine the final general details of the draft treaty. The most difficult issues, namely the Southern Italian border dispute and the Trieste issue, will be discussed first. The latter will still be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for discussion. As the Peace Conference is about to end, and the Four Powers Foreign Ministers prepare to reopen negotiations, the dispute between the East and West blocs remains unresolved, seemingly irreconcilable.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (London Radio): Regarding the rumor that the new Minister of State McNeil will lead the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly on October 23rd, the British Foreign Office has not confirmed it. According to well-informed sources, Bevin will likely still preside in person, and Bevin is said to be very willing to meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky in London, which can be accommodated between October 17th and 25th. Bevin has notified the Egyptian Ambassador in Cairo of this intention through the Chargé d'affaires. Therefore, Bevin may depart for the United States after that time.</p>

<h3>Interlude at the Peace Conference; Loudspeaker Sounds Like a Bugle; Translator Absent-Minded</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 6th] At the plenary session on the first day of the Peace Conference, attendance by representatives from various countries was not enthusiastic. To the right of Chairman Bevin was the U.S. delegation, and to the left was the head of the Greek delegation, Prime Minister Tsaldaris, and other members. Only a small number of representatives from other countries attended. After passing the fifth item on the agenda, the loudspeaker suddenly broke down, sounding like a bugle. In addition, there was an extremely amusing incident. A certain translator, being absent-minded, translated the speech delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky in English into Russian, causing great laughter among the representatives of various countries, and Vishinsky himself was doubled over with laughter.</p>
<h3>Riots by Italians in Trieste</h3>

<h3>Jews Launch Large-Scale Immigration Plan in Palestine; British Troop Movements Said to Be Unrelated; Truman Declaration Causes Arab Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 7th (Radio): President Truman's recent call to allow European Jewish immigrants to enter Palestine has immediately aroused opposition from the Arab side, which issued a warning that if Truman insists on implementing it, the United States' policies in various parts of the Arab world will undoubtedly fail.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 7th] Jewish groups began yesterday to launch a large-scale immigration plan in the Negev region of southern Palestine (i.e., the area between Hebron and the Sinai Peninsula, a military strategic location reserved by the British Morrison Plan). The Palestinian government is considering how to respond. It is reported that the Jews plan to establish twelve Jewish residential areas there. Many trucks carrying construction materials are traveling back and forth, and workers are working tirelessly from sunrise to sunset. A spokesman for the Jewish Association said that this plan is completely legal. These twelve villages are being built on 25,000 acres of land owned by the Jewish National Fund. The three experimental villages there, after adopting a scientific rotation planting method, can produce 150 kilograms per quarter acre, several times more than the 25 kilograms produced on Arab land.</p>
<p>The British military headquarters officially denied today that the movement of troops in southern Palestine was related to the Jewish immigration plan in the Negev region.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 5th (Special Dispatch)] It is reported that Prime Minister Attlee has made a serious "protest" to President Truman this morning and reiterated Britain's attitude on the entire Palestine issue. It is expected that when the British Parliament reconvenes on the 8th after the summer recess, Prime Minister Attlee will make a statement in the House of Commons.</p>

Umari has telegraphed the King of Saudi Arabia and the King of Yemen, as well as the Prime Ministers of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, informing them of this intention.</p>
<h3>After Execution of German War Criminals, to be Buried in Unmarked Graves; Location Secret to Prevent Body Theft</h3>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 7th] Dr. Kapner, who assisted in the prosecution of the eleven Nazi war criminals sentenced to death by the Nuremberg International Tribunal, said today that after the execution of each criminal, they will be buried in an unmarked grave at an undisclosed location. The court wants to make it clear to the world that these warlords are also ordinary criminals, so they plan to hang them instead of shooting them. The burial place of these people will be kept secret, and there will be no tombstones on the graves, to prevent still-undead Nazis from visiting the graves. The court will be responsible for preventing incidents such as the theft of Mussolini's body from happening.</p>
<h3>Göring and Wife's Farewell; Letering Receives Death Sentence; Schacht Leaves Nuremberg</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (Nuremberg Radio): Göring's wife bid farewell to her husband this afternoon between 2:30 and 3:30 PM. The wives of the other war criminals also received the same permission, but only Göring's wife took advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Nuremberg, 7th] One of the German war criminals, namely the former Governor of the occupied area of the Netherlands, Gu Kade, has been sentenced to death. The criminal has now written to the Queen of the Netherlands, asking her to intercede with the Four-Power Control Council in Berlin. The letter states that during his tenure as Governor, he spared the Dutch people all kinds of suffering and took various humanitarian steps to benefit the Dutch people greatly.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nuremberg, 7th] While reviewing his personal documents in prison, Göring found a photo of his wife. After staring at it for a moment, he tore it up in anger, shredding it into pieces and throwing it into the wastepaper basket. Another defendant sentenced to death, Ying Jiade, has appealed to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, claiming to be the savior of the Dutch people, and has tried to alleviate the suffering of the Dutch people in the darkest times.</p>
<p>[United Press Nuremberg, 7th] Former German Naval Commander Leiter today appealed to the Four-Power Control Council to change his life sentence to death by firing squad, saying that this appeal is not an admission of guilt, but because he is 70 years old, physically weak, and will not be in prison for long. Schacht left Nuremberg to visit friends and relatives in "the suburbs of Stuttgart." The military government stated that Schacht has completed the procedures with the military government and the German police. Fritz is currently living in a friend's house in Nuremberg; Papen remains in prison, awaiting a permit from the British-occupied zone to return to his residence in Stockhausen.</p>
<h3>Hess Applies for Amnesty, Offering Two Reasons</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hamburg, 6th] British news agency said: Hess's defense counsel is applying to the Allied Control Council for amnesty based on the following points: (1) Hess is the only defendant sentenced for only the first and second counts listed in the indictment, namely conspiracy and crimes against peace. (2) The Soviet Union at least cannot recognize Germany's policy as a crime, because the Soviet Union also shared the results of Germany's victory, such as the partition of Poland, Bessarabia, etc., and also invaded Finland.</p>
<h3>Germans Used by Others, Large Demonstration in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 6th] There was a demonstration of "victims of fascism" in Wilhelm Square in the Soviet zone of Berlin today, protesting the leniency of the Nuremberg Tribunal's sentences. The demonstrators also demanded that the Nazi movement be purged throughout Germany. Wei Boli Te, one of the leaders of the German Communist Party, claimed that only one-third of Germany is free of fascist forces. Jewish representative Meyer said that the Nuremberg verdict is enough to encourage the resurgence of reactionaries, and it should be unanimously decided to demand that the three released criminals be tried by a court organized solely by Germans. The Social Democratic Party originally planned to participate in today's demonstration, but temporarily withdrew because the demonstration was a Communist propaganda campaign.</p>
<h3>Government Should Take Strict Measures Against U.S. Communist Party Commanded by the Soviet Union; Congressman Thomas Writes to Inspector General</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] U.S. Congressman Thomas today called on the U.S. government to take strict measures against the Communist Party, which is active in the United States and commanded by Moscow. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Clark, he said: "I dare to ask you to immediately stop the activities of this force that is constantly trying to undermine the government." If the Republican Party gains control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, Thomas will become the chairman of the Anti-American Activities Investigation Committee. He told Clark that the following reasons make the Communist Party subject to indictment: (1) The party is controlled by a foreign government and should register with the Inspector General; (2) Although there are regulations that require persons related to foreign countries to register with the State Department, none of the Communist Party members have registered; (3) The Communist Party and others have not complied with the Federal "Corrupt Practices Act" in the past and submitted reports on their campaign expenses to the Senate and House of Representatives; (4) The "Daily Worker" newspaper and the "New Masses" and other official Communist Party publications enjoy second-class mailing privileges, which is a clear violation of postal laws, as it stipulates that mail shall not be used as a propaganda tool; (5) The Communist Party conducts work under the cover of a "front organization" network without paying income tax, as they call themselves charitable organizations or patriotic groups. Thomas pointed out that the Canadian Royal Commission recently found in its report that espionage activities in the country are related to similar activities in the United States. He hopes that a similar trial can be held in the United States soon.</p>

<h3>Thousands of Meteors Will Fly Through Space Tonight; Astronomers Say Rare in History</h3>

According to the university's observatory, this meteor shower will continue for three days, ending on Thursday night. The scale will be unprecedented in astronomical history. At that time, people in the eastern United States will have the clearest view. This phenomenon is caused by the Earth approaching the orbit of the Giacobini-Zinner comet. The original distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 238,000 miles, but during these three days, the distance will only be 131,000 miles.</p>
<h3>Nehru Reprimands Churchill, Demands Quick Withdrawal of British Troops; Nehru and Jinnah Hold Second Meeting</h3>

Churchill's remarks were irresponsible, full of malice, and aimed at inciting disputes and preventing the unification of India. We demand the immediate withdrawal of British troops from India, or at least a very rapid withdrawal. This is our consistent policy, before and after taking office. We do not want to see British troops stay in India for another day. We will never cooperate with those who adopt an unfriendly attitude or hinder Indian independence. They should fully understand this.</p>
<h3>Scientific Fishing; Japanese Professor Invents New Method</h3>

Experiments were conducted under Yagi's guidance in mid-May.</p>
<h3>Fire in Karimun, Heavy Losses for Overseas Chinese</h3>

All 300 overseas Chinese shops in the area were burned to the ground, with a total property loss estimated at 10 million Straits dollars, but fortunately there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Turkish President and Prime Minister Visit Various Border Regions; Ambassadors to the United States and Soviet Union to be Reappointed</h3>
<p>[United Press Istanbul, 7th] The Turkish President and Prime Minister traveled separately today. The Turkish government is said to be finalizing its reply to the Soviet Union's second request for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait. President Inonu suddenly left the capital today to inspect southern Turkey. According to a dispatch from Adana: The President has gone to Xin City on the Aegean Sea. Prime Minister Bayer, in the capacity of Minister of National Defense, has gone to the Serres region, which borders Turkey and Bulgaria. A large army has gathered there, and there were rumors a week ago that the Soviet Union was operating along the Turkish border.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 6th] Ankara Radio said: The Turkish ambassadors to the United States and the Soviet Union will be reappointed. The former ambassador to the Vichy government in France will be transferred to the United States, and Member of Parliament Abdul will serve as the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>The Arctic Can Be Used as a Transportation Route: American Superfortress' Non-Stop Test Flight Proved; General Spaatz Issues Commentary</h3>
<p>[United Press Cairo, 6th] The US Army's Superfortress "Dream Boat" departed from Honolulu, flew non-stop over the Arctic to Cairo, lasting 39 hours and 35 minutes, and safely arrived at the airport outside this city. The entire journey was 9,500 miles, with a starting load of 29,500 pounds. Captain Irvine and his nine crew members were exhausted upon disembarking. According to Irvine, this flight proved that the Superfortress can defend America in any part of the world. Arctic transportation can be developed, and highly skilled pilots can fly, taking the Arctic as</p>
<p>A shortcut for global flight</p>
<p>The Dream Boat had no de-icing equipment in order to carry more fuel, so it had to fly above 4 miles to avoid encountering freezing weather along the way. High-altitude flight consumes a lot of fuel. When it landed, there were only 400 gallons of gasoline left, barely enough to wet the bottom of the thirty-six fuel tanks. Each tank can hold 13,000 gallons when full. According to Helmsman Major Hayes, the Dream Boat's speed was 250 miles per hour, breaking the aircraft's previous record of 234 miles per hour from Guam to Washington, but it did not break the Navy's "Fury" aircraft's non-stop flight record of 11,236 miles from Perth to Seattle days ago.</p>
<p>Hayes led the Dream Boat entirely relying on a six-pound radio compass, as the aircraft was flying in dense shade, with no sky above and no ground below. Most of the flight was above the clouds to avoid icing. One of the most difficult sections was between Baffin Island and Iceland, where the Dream Boat ascended to 22,000 feet, but still could not completely escape the freezing climate.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 6th] The US Army's Superfortress "Dream Boat" flew 16,480 kilometers from Hawaii over the Arctic to Cairo. Captain Owen stated that the Arctic</p>
<p>The actual location of the magnetic pole</p>
<p>is 320 kilometers further north than shown on current Arctic maps, which is the same as what British astronomer Sir Jones claimed today. Canadian scientists believe that the Arctic underground may contain large amounts of magnetic material, so high-altitude tests can be more accurate.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 6th] Regarding the successful attempt by American pilot Captain Irvine to fly the "Dream Boat" Superfortress directly from Honolulu to Cairo, British Air Force Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>General Spaatz Commented</p>
<p>that this is sufficient to prove that industrial countries and countries manufacturing atomic bombs are all within the range of atomic bomb attacks. At the same time, it is also known that this type of Superfortress can carry ten tons of bombs, fly in the Arctic, and bomb areas north of 40 degrees north latitude.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] Air Force Commander Spaatz issued his opinion today on the successful Arctic flight of the Superfortress Dream Boat, saying: This proves that well-equipped aircraft can fly over the Arctic, and collect valuable reports on various issues such as flight, engineering, transportation, climate, gasoline consumption, and hunger endurance. However, this is purely a scientific experiment, and the aircraft has no combat equipment. The aircraft used in this experiment is relatively old. Other bombers have much larger size, capacity, and flying distance than this aircraft, and are being prototyped or have already been built. This type of aircraft, such as the Dream Boat and the Angry Turtle, can generally fly around the globe, with spare space to carry bombs.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 6th] Senior American military experts believe that the Army's B-29's successful flight over the Arctic has finally proved that the United States is indeed vulnerable to attacks from the north. Army Department officials strongly stated that Secretary Patterson's main intention in requesting the United States to implement compulsory military training is to establish a people's army to cope with invaders coming from the air.</p>

<h3>The City Council's Various Committees Held Their First Meetings Yesterday; Chairpersons of Each Committee Were Elected Respectively</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council held its first subcommittee meetings yesterday afternoon at the City Chamber of Commerce on the second floor of the Tianhou Palace Bridge, divided into eleven groups. The main item of the meeting was the election of three chairpersons for each group. The election method was based on four principles: (1) Each group should have three chairpersons. (2) The election of chairpersons for each group should be by anonymous ballot. (3) The type of committee should be written by the voters themselves on the ballot. (4) Voters should mainly choose committees they are interested in. The ballots were counted on the spot after voting.</p>
<p>The meeting started at 9:00 AM with the five committees for Autonomy, Finance, Land Administration, Education, and Society. At 3:00 PM, the six committees for Police Affairs, Public Works, Public Utilities, Health, Budget and Final Accounts, and Laws and Regulations held their meetings. Speaker Gong Zhan and Xu Changji personally attended and presided over the meetings. The election results were: (1) Autonomy: Chen Baotai, Zhu Wende, Xia. (2) Finance: Zhao Dihua, Shen Ding, Wang Yansong. (3) Land Administration: Wang Xianqing, Lu Shidao, Wang Wei. (4) Education: Tong Xingbai, Zhou Feicheng, Xu Ze.

<h3>The Film and Theater Industries Submit Additional Reasons Requesting a Reduction in Entertainment Tax, Guaranteeing 1.8 Billion in Tax Payments for October</h3>
<p>When the Second Finance Group submitted the proposal to review the Film and Theater Industry Association's request for a reduction in the entertainment tax rate due to it being too high, Speaker Pan personally attended to explain the film and theater industry's demands, stating that the two industry associations proposed two points: (1) The industry had no reason to oppose the City Council's resolution to increase the entertainment tax by 10%. (2) The previous entertainment tax of 50% included 20% for the defense corps' clothing expenses. Now that the City Council has decided to cancel the defense corps' clothing expenses, the 20% should be canceled immediately. If the 10% increase is added to the original 30%, the tax should be 40% (as previously levied). The industry association is willing to guarantee to the Municipal Finance Bureau that it will pay 1.8 billion yuan in taxes in October. If there is a shortfall, it will be apportioned by each theater. This case was resolved to be retained and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. The group also resolved that all future proposals should be printed and distributed three days in advance for thorough study. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month (Monday) at the Bank of Communications on the third floor.</p>
<p>The Tenth Budget and Final Accounts Group discussed two cases: (1) Councilor Zhao Yangxiong's proposal for the New Life Movement Promotion Association's publicity expenses was resolved to be submitted to the general meeting for discussion based on Councilor Li Wenjie's calculation. That is, the New Life Movement's request to include 5 million yuan in monthly operating expenses in the budget, requesting four months first, is proposed to allocate 20 million yuan. The proposed establishment fee of 20 million yuan for the demonstration area is proposed to be calculated at 85%, which is 17 million yuan. The total should be an additional 37 million yuan. (2) The Health Bureau's submission of additional budget books for increasing the number of civilian clinics was sent directly to the Council, which did not comply with the procedure. The bureau should submit it to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Council for review. The group decided that the next meeting would be held from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 23rd, and the location would be determined separately.</p>
<h3>Relieving Hidden Poverty, Solving the Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>The Fifth Social Committee discussed temporary motions: (1) It is proposed that the Municipal Government forward to the Central Government a plan for providing assistance to hidden poverty nationwide and application methods. The proposers and seconders of the case reached 82 people. It was resolved to send it to the Municipal Government for reference, with the application method for hidden poverty attached as a reference. (2) The housing shortage in the city is serious. Effective measures should be determined and strictly implemented, and the implementation method should be actively promoted and revised before being passed. (3) Many of the resolutions on labor movement submitted by the Temporary Council have not been implemented. Please implement them promptly. After review, please implement them promptly. (4) Strengthen the review of drama, singing, and radio broadcasting work to correct social atmosphere. After review, it was resolved to retain it for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Dredging Rivers</h3>
<p>When the Seventh Public Works Group held a meeting, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau personally participated and explained various issues. The group's discussion yesterday resulted in the determination that the Second-Class main rivers that should be urgently repaired are Rihui Port and Zoumatang (both rivers are currently under construction). The First-Class tributary rivers that should be dredged first are Shajing Port, Taoshupu, Dousupu, and Majiabang. The total cost for dredging the above six rivers is 290 million yuan, of which 80 million yuan has been included in the budget. Manpower should also be included in the other 210 million yuan. According to the Shanghai River Dredging Regulations, the dredging expenses for First and Second-Class rivers are entirely borne by the beneficiary areas, but in special circumstances, a request can be submitted to the Public Works Bureau to transfer it to the Municipal Government for allocation of subsidies. The amount of subsidies shall not exceed 40% of the total dredging expenses of each river.</p>
<p>The Ninth Health Group's discussion resulted in a proposal to divide into groups to investigate the Health Bureau's implementation of health conditions. Ms. Tang Guifen is responsible for investigating factory health aspects. The focus of the group's discussions in the future is planned to be on the health conditions of schools and factories.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Destroyed School Buildings</h3>
<p>The Fourth Education Group passed a temporary motion after revising the method, requesting the Municipal Government to rebuild the buildings of all municipal primary and secondary schools destroyed during the war. All construction costs should be included in the budget for the 36th year.</p>
<p>The Sixth Police Affairs Group passed a temporary motion proposing that the Municipal Government strengthen drug prohibition and burn the seized drugs on a monthly basis to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>The Eleventh Laws and Regulations Group discussed a temporary motion proposing that the relevant departments and courts of the Central Government formulate regulations for the organization of employees in various industries. After review, this case was retained for discussion at the next meeting at the City Council at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month. At the same time, the Municipal Government is requested to send all regulations to the subcommittee for review first.</p>
<h3>Hanging the National Flag, Passing a Uniform Method</h3>
<p>The First Autonomy Group passed a resolution "regarding the organization of hanging the national flag in this city, it should be in accordance with the regulations of the National Government to list the flag-raising dates, raising and lowering times, ceremonies, and the angle and dates of half-mast flags, and issue them to each household or group, in order to achieve uniformity and grandeur."</p>
<p>In addition, the Third Land Administration Group and the Eighth Public Utilities Group adjourned after electing chairpersons because there were no motions for discussion.</p>
<p>The Secretariat will organize and schedule the dates, times, and locations of the next meetings of each group, and will notify them later.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters' Memorial Week, Fang Zhi Encourages Comrades</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters held a general memorial week this morning at the Aitang Road Auditorium, presided over by Fang Zhi himself. After performing the ceremony, Fang Zhi first praised the former Director Wu Shaoshu for his hard work in Shanghai, and then spoke about the future direction of the Shanghai party affairs work, and put forward three points to encourage all comrades of the headquarters and the various district party branches: (1) Restrain material enjoyment, pay attention to spiritual cultivation, transform the environment, shift the declining trend, and establish a new atmosphere. (2) Should work hard, be practical and seek to achieve things, do not perfunctorily follow the old ways to deceive and cover things up, in order to complete the work. Afterwards, Fang Zhi introduced the new Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, and members Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaosong, Tao Baichuan, Xu Mingya, etc. to the comrades. The ceremony ended at half past ten.</p>
<p>Also reported: The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has already designated Tao Baichuan as the Director of the Propaganda Department and Chen Baotai as the Director of the Organization and Training Department. The two have scheduled to go to work within the day.</p>
<p>[Another report] Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, went to the Office of the Executive Yuan of the Bank of China before ten o'clock yesterday morning to pay respects to Premier Song of the Executive Yuan and discussed matters until he left at half past ten.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Investigation Work Concludes; Wu Wangji Talks About His Impressions Before Leaving; Not Focused on Negative Investigation, But on Active Application; Methods Should Be Found Quickly to Settle Matters After the Investigation</h3>
<p>Investigator Wu Wangji of the Investigation Team is rushing to handle the investigation work in Zhejiang Province. He went to Hangzhou last night with Chairman Shen of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. When the reporter asked Wu about his impressions of the investigation in Shanghai before his departure, Wu said that the Investigation Team's organization was simple and the time was too short, and he regretted that he was unable to carry out a thorough investigation to complete the task satisfactorily. He also said that there was no precedent for receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials, and it was inevitable that it was chaotic and messy, especially the large amount of materials and the complexity of the situation in Shanghai. As far as he could see, he believed that the most abuses arose from the military and civilians taking advantage of the chaos during the initial period of the enemy's surrender and the military chaos. However, this was understandable during the military transition period. After the arrival of the central personnel in Shanghai and the formal establishment of the Municipal Government and the Garrison Command, there were still many irregular and illegal receiving cases or improper handling incidents due to the complexity of the receiving personnel in Shanghai, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Handling Bureau, the management of enemy and puppet materials has begun to be standardized. However, the bureau is a temporary institution and the staff is inevitably uneven. The handling of cases is often delayed. Also, due to the large size of the institution, abuses follow. Or because of different opinions on handling cases, disputes arise frequently, causing many social repercussions. In all fairness, the handling of complex enemy and puppet property was originally a difficult task. The bureau handled more than 3,000 cases in less than a year, increasing the national treasury's revenue by 300 billion yuan, which is a commendable effort. However, whether the handling policies and principles are appropriate, legal, and reasonable is another question. In the negative aspect, although the Investigation Team failed to fully investigate the dereliction of duty, corruption, or embezzlement of officials involved in receiving and handling, in the positive aspect, it made the people aware that the central government attached importance to this work, giving a serious blow to those who took advantage of their power and position to seize and occupy enemy and puppet materials. After the arrival of the Investigation Team in Shanghai, this group of evildoers has gradually disappeared. It is estimated that the discovery of hidden materials or occupied materials and the increase in the national treasury's revenue will be over 10 billion yuan, which is also a considerable gain. Today, the problem is no longer in the negative investigation and handling of corruption, but in the active application. The enemy's remaining materials, such as the large amount of cotton yarn, cloth, and daily necessities stored in various warehouses, should be auctioned off quickly to clear the warehouses. How to equip the troops with military equipment and old military supplies, even shell casings and scrap iron, or have them recovered by ordnance factories. How to accelerate the resumption of work in the factories received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, even if the people are unable to buy the factories, the government should also lease them or have them exclusively operated by various industries without conditions, so as to use them as soon as possible and restore production to save the current decline. The earliest possible settlement of the sealing of houses and small shops and the occupied houses and properties is also the most important plan. It must be known that after the investigation, there must be a settlement. The investigation has revealed the abuses of enemy and puppet materials. In order to prescribe the right medicine, the central competent authorities must find a way to settle matters, and then the reception and handling of enemy and puppet materials can be concluded as soon as possible. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau is a temporary institution. It is hoped that local governments and legal entities will prepare as soon as possible so that the settlement work can be more effective.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Two Couples Have Already Participated in the Double Tenth Group Wedding</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The third group wedding organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is being prepared by the Fourth Division, and everything is now in place. A total of 32 couples will participate. It will be held at 10:00 AM on October 10 at the auditorium of the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road. Mayor Wu will personally officiate the wedding, and Cai Dianrong will serve as the general director. The ceremony is simple and solemn. Each couple is only charged 20,000 yuan. This session was originally scheduled for May 5, organized by the Civil Affairs Division, but later, following the order of the central government, etiquette matters were still handled by the Social Affairs Bureau, so it was postponed to October 10. The next session is scheduled for December 12. In the future, it will be held four times a year, set on March 3, May 5, October 10, and December 12.</p>
<h3>Canadian Ambassador General Odlum Discusses the Chinese Situation at Length; Received Reporters Yesterday and Left Shanghai for His Home Country on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Canadian Ambassador to China General Odlum held a press conference in Shanghai yesterday morning, imparting farewell words, and offered many pertinent criticisms of today's China. Odlum engaged in journalism in his early years, came to China in 1942 to take office, and made many contributions to promoting Sino-Canadian diplomatic relations and trade between the two countries. He has also achieved great success in carefully studying the actual situation in our country for the past two or three years. This time he was summoned to return to his country to report on his work. It has not yet been decided when he will come to China again. Odlum first promoted the precious friendship between China and Canada, and said:</p>
<p>The signing of the Sino-Canadian trade agreement will depend on the progress of the Sino-US trade agreement, but he can assert that once the Sino-Canadian trade agreement is signed, its scope will be extremely broad and meaningful. Talking about the current situation in China, Odlum believes that writing peace is of no practical use. We must meet each other with sincerity and cooperate wholeheartedly to achieve true peace. Signing agreements on paper is of no help to peace. However, General Odlum emphasized one point. He believes that China has its weaknesses, but it also has many strengths. Outsiders only know China's corruption, greed, and darkness, but the Chinese people are a nation with a hard-working spirit and the patience to struggle and strengthen themselves. After he returns to his country, he will tell the Canadians what he has seen, heard, researched, and learned in China over the past three years, so that they can understand China's various difficulties and problems.</p>
<p>The Chinese people deserve admiration in three ways: first, their hard work and endurance, second, the progress of the education sector in recent years, and third, the superb skills of Chinese handicrafts, which will be a major export in the future. When asked for his opinion on the future of democratic politics in China, Odlum said: Most of the Chinese people, whether they understand democracy or not, eagerly await democratic politics and are developing in this direction. Democratic politics is not without any weaknesses. Western democratic countries are also prone to errors, but one thing can be guaranteed, that is, democratic countries never launch aggression. Therefore, all Western freedom-loving and democratic countries hope that China will achieve peace and realize democracy as soon as possible, which will be of great benefit to the future peace of the world. He believes that to study China, one should start with China's leaders. After three years of dedicated research, he admits that he has a understanding of China's four major political parties, but refuses to make any criticism, only believing that they are quite similar to Canadian political parties. When asked whether China's current situation may cause the third</p>
<p>World War, Odlum believes that this is not possible, but once World War III unfortunately breaks out, China will occupy an important position. As for Odlum himself, he is slightly pessimistic about the peace of the world today. Finally, when talking about Canada's foreign policy, Odlum humbly stated that Canada is a newly emerging country, deeply assisted by the United Kingdom and the United States. As a member of the world's democratic countries, he will naturally work hard for democracy. The purpose of his mission to China this time is to establish good contacts with China and strengthen the interests of both countries. He finally stated that these three years in China were the most meaningful period of his life.</p>
<p>Also reported: General Odlum has already left China by plane from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to return to Canada.</p>

<h3>Fang Fushu Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the Diligence and Cunning of the Japanese, Which Should Serve as a Warning to Our People; Debauchery and the Enticement of Beauties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fang Fushu, a Chinese judge who served as an aide to the Chinese judge, Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, and the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, when they testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal, recently returned to China from Japan. He told reporters yesterday about the recent situation in Japan: the general situation in defeated Japan is better than that in our victorious country.</p>
<p>Fang felt emotional about the chaos in the country and the stability of Japanese society. He said that although Japan cannot yet be said to be reviving and prosperous, the scars of the war have gradually healed. The burnt remains of major cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama have been cleared and swept away, and the city appearance has gradually returned to its former appearance. The Ginza area, which was once desolate, has also recovered its former prosperity.</p>
<p>Although the lives of the Japanese people are still difficult, they do not live in the turbulent waves of soaring prices like the citizens of Shanghai. In general, only clothing and transportation are relatively lacking. Although there is also a housing shortage, there is no phenomenon like in Shanghai where huge amounts of gold bars are being used to top prices. The black market exists, but it is not rampant. Although there are unemployed people, they are optimistic. They believe that due to the gradually developing reconstruction work, they will soon have employment opportunities. In general, the government has effective control, and the people abide by the law and obey, so even though the country has failed, there is hope, and even though the people are suffering, their lives are stable.</p>
<p>Fang continued: What is especially worthy of our people's warning is that Japan is a diligent and cunning nation, good at seizing opportunities. They know very well that their fate is now in the hands of the United States. They also know very well the United States' policy towards Japan under the current international situation. Therefore, they are increasingly showing their ability to cater to, flatter, and fawn upon the United States. At present, many of the US troops stationed in Japan have a sense of "being happy and forgetting their homeland," because the Japanese side is doing everything possible to provide all the comfortable and comfortable life and the enjoyment of debauchery, and serving them diligently in order to win the favor of the beauties.</p>
<p>As for the International Tribunal, since it started in May of this year, it is still in the stage of providing evidence from various countries. Then the defendants will defend themselves, and then the prosecutors will refute. The sentencing date will be in March or April of next year. For the charges against the war criminals, the evidence for the two crimes of atrocities and mistreatment of prisoners of war is relatively conclusive, but the two crimes of conspiracy and launching a war of aggression have some room for evasion in law. Fortunately, the precedent of the Nuremberg Tribunal's judgment on German war criminals can be used as a reference for future convictions.</p>
<h3>General Chennault Will Leave Shanghai for Beijing Today</h3>
<p>Flying Tiger General Chennault is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing by plane at 7:30 this morning. He will pay respects to Chairman Chiang and relevant authorities to discuss matters related to the Aviation Association. It is reported that Chen will stay at the Lizhi Society in Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Agricultural Association of China Will Hold Its Annual Meeting on the 9th</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Association of China is scheduled to hold its eighth annual meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road in this city at 8:30 AM on October 9. It is also planned to invite people from all walks of life to attend the meeting and express their opinions on the future of agriculture for reference. A joint public banquet will be held by various agricultural institutions on the same day in the afternoon and evening.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xuan, the Commander, Replies to a Letter from Reporters</h3>
<p>To the esteemed military correspondents of all newspapers:</p>
<p>Having read your letter published in yesterday's newspapers in this city, requesting my response, I hereby provide the following reply:</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters is an official institution and cannot accommodate visitors all day long. As a military organization, it must prioritize military confidentiality and cannot indiscriminately disclose information. Even for publishable news, secrecy is necessary before its official release. Therefore, I am determined to establish fixed times and locations for meetings, and news releases must not compromise military secrets. This is my duty to regulate internal affairs and my right to do so. There is no reason to obstruct our duties unless laws stipulate that "official institutions are subject to the control of news reporters."</p>
<p>To differentiate reporters from ordinary visitors, I have appointed Major General Yu Yong, a senior staff officer, to be responsible for receiving you, with designated meeting times from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, providing as much information as possible. To call this a "blockade" is to deny the special arrangement unfairly. If this does not allow complete freedom, the words of Madame Roland are most apt. Your requests for a press room at every location and a half-hour meeting with me each week are unnecessary, considering the limited news output of this headquarters, the insufficient personnel, and my inability to commit to a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>"The Garrison Headquarters will never shut its doors." Things remain as they were: you may enter, someone will announce your arrival, someone will guide you, and someone will engage in conversation. There has never been anyone turned away during designated meeting hours, nor any instance of guards being beaten with clubs. This alone is enough to demonstrate the necessity of accurate reporting. The Garrison Headquarters is a public institution, and its news releases are mostly reports of official business. We cannot fulfill your requests to create "fresh" stories. If you deem official reports unworthy of publication, we have no right to force your hand. However, please note this: you are free to gather news, and we are free to conduct official business. Fairness and mutual benefit are the principles to uphold. I have said all I need to say and hope there will be no need for a second response. Xuan Tiewu.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Inspection of the "Black Market": Three Arrested for Illegal Trading of US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Following the sharp rise in US dollar exchange rates last week, all money exchanges suspended trading for three days and resumed yesterday. The authorities temporarily set the market price of the US dollar at 3,500 yuan, and any trading exceeding this limit would be suppressed. However, yesterday at around 4:00 PM, some people were still engaged in black market trading of US dollars in the Sichuan Road and Central Road area, with substantial transactions. Mayor Wu, while inspecting the above locations, witnessed the situation and immediately telephoned the Huangpu Police Bureau. The branch director Du Chun, the deputy branch director Wang Xie Gong, accompanied by section chief Li Yin Min, and a number of police officers rushed to the scene and arrested the following people: Jewish man Lüt-Qiu Huangte (52 years old, residing at No. 96, Lane 818, Tangshan Road), Chinese man Chen Xihe (28 years old, residing at No. 7, Lane 359, Fujian Road), and Lin Shiqiu (24 years old, residing at No. 21, Yuanchang Lane, Yuanfang Road). Several hundred US dollar notes were confiscated and taken to the station. Branch Director Du personally conducted the interrogation, and after verifying the facts and taking statements, ordered their detention, scheduling their transfer to the Municipal Police Bureau this morning for strict legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Minor Records of Election Conveners: The Budget Group Mutually Declines the Position of Chairman; the Police Affairs Group Decides by Lot</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the City Council's various subcommittee held their first meeting since the general assembly adjourned. Because it was the first meeting, the results of the meeting did not involve concrete discussion. However, during the most important task of electing conveners, two small incidents occurred.</p>
<p>The first incident occurred in the tenth group, the Budget and Final Accounts Committee, which was electing three conveners. The work of budgeting and final accounting is arguably the most important task in the City Council, especially the "budget" part. All facilities for the four million citizens of Shanghai are financed by the municipal government. How much money does the municipal government need? What things should money be spent on? What things are unnecessary? Where should more money be spent? Where should less money be spent? All such "decisions" must be made by the City Council. However, the City Council has too many things to decide, and there is not enough time to study and discuss every detail. Of course, this major task must be handed over to a special subcommittee for preliminary deliberation. Each subcommittee has three conveners, who, as the name suggests, simply convene meetings, but they are also the responsible persons, especially the chief convener, who is also the chairman of the committee. The importance of the chairman and responsible person in a meeting is evident, and it is "human nature" for some councilors to actively campaign for the position of convener beforehand.</p>
<p>The previous budget reviewers and conveners were councilors Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and He Yuanming. The efforts these three councilors made in the last budget review are truly admirable. Accountant Li Wenjie spent an entire night working on the budget without sleep.</p>
<p>Yesterday's election results, without these two experienced accountants, were somewhat unexpected. In fact, the election of He Yuanming, Yu Shun, and Wang Naixu as councilors was also "what everyone hoped for." However, when He Yuanming was nominated as chairman, he seemed very displeased and insisted on refusing the position. The atmosphere in the small meeting place suddenly became tense, and reporters crowded into that corner, looking at each other. The councilors repeatedly asked He to take his seat, but he refused to agree under any circumstances. Councilor Xu Yongzuo retreated from the position of temporary convener to a seat on the side. Councilor Li Wenjie, with the second-highest number of votes, was repeatedly nominated by those present to take the position of chairman, but he also refused, saying, "We worked hard last time and should take turns." The stalemate lasted for a quarter of an hour, and the meeting could not begin. Vice-Chairman Xu Jiyi said, "Since they have been elected, they should hold the meeting in order." But it was to no avail. Finally, someone suggested, "Then Mr. Yu Shun should take the position." Councilor Yu Shun's situation was, of course, also difficult. While hesitating, he said repeatedly, "Don't be polite, don't be polite." When it was his turn, it seemed that it was "inevitable" and he could no longer refuse. So, he stood up resolutely and said, "Let's do it then." Finally, the stalemate was broken, and the first meeting was hastily completed.</p>
<p>The second incident to be mentioned is a scene from the sixth Police Affairs Group election. The sixth group elected Hou Jiyuan as the first-place candidate, and there should have been two more. However, Jiang Pingluo, Zhang Naizuo, and Fan Shusheng all received the same number of votes. While trying to find a solution, Jiang Pingluo suddenly remembered that he had not voted for himself, so he wanted to add one vote. Reporters in another group only heard loud noises from this side and hurriedly looked over. It turned out that Councilor Zhang Naizuo was getting angry: "How can we re-elect after the votes have been counted? I object! I don't agree! I am completely against it!" Councilor Jiang then said, "I withdraw voluntarily! I don't want to participate at all! I am not here to be elected! I will definitely withdraw!" After much commotion, the Secretary-General and secretaries came to mediate and came up with a satisfactory solution: drawing lots. As a result, Zhang Naizuo and Fei Shusheng were elected. The lively scene finally subsided.</p>

<h3>A Female Traitor of the Kawashima Yoshiko Type, Han Youjie, Enslaved the Military and Civilians and Lured Guerrilla Forces, Active in North China for Twenty Years, Denied Chinese Citizenship at the First Trial in the High Court Yesterday, Obvious Crimes and Repeated Service in the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court tried a suspected female traitor case involving someone who held an important position in the enemy's military. The protagonist is named Han Youjie, currently 41 years old, originally of Japanese nationality, named Nakajima Shigeko. Eighteen years ago, she married Han Jingtang from Lishu, Fengtian, in Beiping, and obtained Chinese citizenship, and took the name Han Youjie. The prosecutor's indictment alleged that after the September 18th Incident, the defendant served as an advisor to the staff department of the enemy chieftain Honjo Shigeru, and as the dean of the pseudo-Fengtian Shanlin Women's Middle School. After the July 7th Incident, she transferred to Beiping and served as an advisor to the enemy's military police and army intelligence agencies. She was responsible for liaising with the pseudo-local security maintenance association and also served as the director of the women's comforting class under Terauchi of the enemy's North China Front Army, using the name of comforting refugees and prisoners to enslave our military and civilians. Later, she served as a recruitment worker under Yamashita Tomoyuki, the commander of the enemy's Beijing corps. She was later promoted to colonel and engaged in luring our guerrilla forces. Subsequently, upon the order of Yamashita, she went to northern Manchuria to investigate the Soviet army, and then at the invitation of Ono, the commander of the enemy's Nanjing military police, and Shao Wenkai, the pseudo-governor of Henan Province, she went to Henan and Shandong provinces to lure more than 70,000 of our guerrilla forces. Last April, the commander of the enemy fleet wanted to contact the Dingyuan bandit army, and the defendant was ordered to carry out the task. After the victory, she also negotiated the matter of receiving enemy weapons and supplies. The above can be corroborated by the defendant's own account in the Military Command Bureau's handbook of her twenty years of activity in China. Therefore, her treason in carrying out military duties to endanger our country began as early as September 18th, and after the July 7th Incident, it became even more rampant, doing everything possible. After the victory, she even colluded with the traitorous bandits, plotting irregularities, and should be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the defendant wore a blue cheongsam with small red flowers, a yellow wool coat with green flowers, light yellow socks, and black cloth shoes. Her long hair was draped over her shoulders, and she wore a white hair clip. She was holding a child of about one year old with tangerines with a flag in her hand. When questioned by the presiding judge, the defendant claimed in a Japanese-accented Mandarin: Because her uncle worked in the Japanese Army Attaché Office in Beiping, she came to China in 1926 and studied at a French church school in Beiping. In 1928, she married Han Jingtang, and her parents were strongly opposed to this. In 1931, she went to the Northeast, and after repeated invitations, she was forced to serve as an advisor to Honjo Shigeru's staff department in the Kwantung Army, but she received no salary or letter of appointment. Only when the common people had requests that could not be fulfilled would she represent them in contacting the Japanese army. She only served as the dean of Shanlin Women's Middle School for four months.</p>
<p>During the July 7th Incident, the Japanese sent four telegrams from Shenyang inviting her, and she was forced to go to Beiping to serve as an advisor to the Japanese military police and army intelligence agencies. Later, she also served as the director of the women's comforting class under General Terauchi of the North China Front Army, all purely for the purpose of helping refugees, women and children. Within a few months of the July 7th Incident, she had already helped more than 50,000 people. Later, she served as a recruitment worker under Yamashita Tomoyuki, the commander of the Beijing corps, with a salary equivalent to that of a colonel. In Baoding, Zunhua, Shandong, and the Great Wall area in Hebei, she incorporated or helped or discharged more than 70,000 stray troops, including their families. Later, she was transferred to Manila by Yamashita. When the Japanese army was fighting the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu, Ono, the commander of the Nanjing military police, sent her to inquire about the situation of the people and distributed 60 million yuan worth of relief supplies to the people. In April of last year, when the situation in Japan became dangerous, she was ordered by the commander to go to northern Jiangsu to contact the New Fourth Army for peace, not to contact them with any intention of taking action. On June 1st, the New Fourth Army detained her, accusing her of being a spy, and monitored her for 80 days. She was released only after Japan surrendered, but a small team was assigned to monitor her and send her to Nanjing to contact the Japanese naval attaché office to hand over the guns, but she was unsuccessful. Later, because she and her six-month-old child were both sick, a cousin who was a doctor in Shanghai invited her to come to Shanghai with two guards and a doctor to be treated in the hospital. She arrived in Shanghai on September 21st last year and was reported to the Military Command Bureau by a traitorous policeman at the station and arrested. She was later transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office. Without much questioning, she was prosecuted on suspicion of treason. Although she married a Chinese man, her parents did not allow it. According to Japanese law, when marrying a foreigner, one must obtain the permission of their parents before being allowed to renounce their original nationality. Therefore, she has not yet acquired Chinese citizenship and is still Japanese. The prosecutor also accused her of working as a spy for the Japanese all along, but what she did was all relief work to help the people. Since she married a Chinese man, of course she loves China. She has six children and enough food at home, so there is no need to be a spy. Now, her husband, Han Jingtang, and her children are missing in the Northeast, and it is unknown whether they are dead or alive. After the court investigation, she was ordered to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date. The defendant briefly spoke to two Japanese expatriates who remained in Shanghai and were in the courtroom, and then, holding her child, was escorted back to prison.</p>
<h3>Wang Jintian Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Jintian was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy's Minhang military police and as the head of Ganlu Township in the pseudo-Shenjiang County, oppressing the people. The High Court specially questioned Ueeda Masakazu, the former commander of the enemy's Minhang military police. According to him, he did not know Wang Jintian. Wang himself admitted to having served as the pseudo-township head, but not as a secret agent for the enemy's military police. The case will be re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Indian Policeman Kartousin Case Concluded</h3>
<p>The cases of Indian policeman Kartousin, a guard at the Shanghai Haifang Road concentration camp during the enemy and pseudo-government period who abused British expatriates, and Wang Shoulun, a translator at the enemy's military police North Sichuan Road headquarters, were concluded on the same day and are scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>More Than 3,000 Buildings Confiscated from the Enemy and Pseudo-Regimes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau has taken over the enemy and pseudo-government real estate in this city. After verifying the property rights and approving the return of the properties, the base land totals 323 units, and the real estate totals 762 units (each unit ranging from one building to hundreds of buildings). The number of Anglo-American expatriate properties returned is 730 units. The Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau has determined to confiscate more than 300 units of enemy and pseudo-government houses, totaling more than 3,000 buildings. The total land area that has been determined to be confiscated is 9.866 acres and 796 square feet. There are still more than 8,000 acres being re-examined by the Central Trust Bureau. All real estate that has been determined to be confiscated will be auctioned according to the regulations of the central government.</p>
<h3>Ohlhaver Bureau Espionage Case Re-examined by the US Military Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ohlhaver Bureau espionage case was re-examined by the US military court yesterday, with Mori, the former director of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department stationed in Shanghai, testifying.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese, after Germany surrendered, the spies of the Ohlhaver Bureau voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese side and continued to engage in espionage. Although Ohlhaver issued an order to dissolve the bureau, he stated in a telegram to the spies that he did not object to individuals cooperating with the Japanese military authorities and never prevented the Japanese side from using the bureau's spies. As for himself, he claimed that he was weak and ill and could not continue to work, but was willing to assist as much as possible. At that time, the German receiving station in Shanghai was the best radio station in the Shanghai area. After it was taken over by the Japanese, it was continued to be operated by German and Italian personnel until the end of the war.</p>
<p>During yesterday's hearing, there was an unexpected incident. Chief Defense Counsel Lieutenant Colonel Paulding suddenly announced that lawyer Yao Zhaodi had withdrawn from the defense group. It is reported that Lawyer Yao was recently the one who represented Shen Ke, one of the spies, in suing Mr. Lunnell of the Associated Press.</p>
<h3>"War of Resistance Wife" Case Continues: Sa Benju's Meritorious Service to the Country During the War; Defense Lawyers Argue that There are Mitigating Circumstances</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Sa Benju, the nephew of Admiral Sa Zhenbing, originally married Chen Jizheng. During the War of Resistance, Sa went to work in the interior and married his colleague Shi Biren. After the victory, Chen filed a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office, and the prosecutor charged Sa Benju and Shi Biren with bigamy. This scene of a "War of Resistance wife" involved in a lawsuit was re-examined in court yesterday morning. Shi Biren and Sa Benju were both present in court. Sa's defense lawyer presented that Sa had been ordered by Chairman Chiang to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Hunter, the British Ambassador's Army Attaché, Major Jude, and Mr. Watts, the general manager of Kailuan Coal Mine and head of the British Information Office, to Chongqing. When the Japanese army entered the concession, he disguised them as transporting cloth, loaded them into wooden boxes, transported them out of the Japanese army blockade line, and transferred them to the interior, for which he was praised by Chairman Chiang. Although this matter is not related to the main body of the case, Sa's meritorious service to the country can also be used as a reference when making a judgment. Moreover, Sa and Shi's combination was based on close emotional ties from working together. Moreover, marrying a War of Resistance wife was popular in the rear at the time, so the facts are excusable. The case is now scheduled for further examination on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Where Does the News Come From? The Tension of Reporters When the Telephone Rings</h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] An ordinary second-run movie theater. Although the colorful advertising sign in front of the door is full of exaggerated and exciting words, the picture of the heroine is peeling and tattered because of the heavy rain last night. The show is about to start, and the audience is arriving in a steady stream, but not in large numbers. Suddenly, an inconspicuous vagrant walked in and took out a dark thing from his side. A hand went up, and there was a deafening explosion in the theater, and seven or eight people fell to the ground...</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, news reporters appeared in the hospital, the police station, and the scene of the incident, with the flashbulbs on their cameras flashing.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, on the news pages of this city, the list of injured people and the extent of their injuries will be listed one by one.</p>
<p>All of Shanghai, all of China, the whole world—it seems that news reporters are watching in every corner. Every day, they transmit all the news to the world at the fastest speed.</p>
<p>The twentieth century is a century of movement, and news reporters are the ones who record these activities.</p>
<p>You may wonder how reporters know so much detail. For example, when the movie theater was bombed, there was clearly no reporter on the scene. How did they get the news in a matter of minutes?</p>
<p>If all of Shanghai's telephone lines were suddenly damaged, you would guess the reporters' secret. Because if the telephone bells of all Shanghai do not ring for one day, you may hardly see a newspaper tomorrow. The news that comes from telegrams is really pitifully small.</p>
<p>Admittedly, under the current circumstances, the telephone equipment of various newspapers is far from meeting the actual needs, but the telephone is still the most important source of all news. The telephones in the newsrooms rarely stop ringing, and the reporters' ways of answering the phone are also diverse and spectacular. Some speak Shanghainese, some speak Cantonese, and of course, Mandarin is the most common language. In addition, English is used a lot, and French is also used.</p>
<p>The same person may use several completely different tones when answering the phone several times—this time he may be a very polite gentleman, and a few minutes later he may immediately turn into a majestic and high-spirited "tycoon." News reporters are somewhat similar to theater actors in this regard. They are often frank, straightforward, and concise, but sometimes they specialize in diplomatic wording. Often, when hearing the most important news, the reporters' expressions are calm, as if they don't care at all. But as soon as he puts down the phone, you will see him extremely nervous, sometimes writing non-stop, sometimes immediately preparing to set off in pursuit, and the newspaper's archives are also busy finding all the reference materials that can be matched with the news.</p>
<p>Long-distance calls are of course even more important. Sometimes, as soon as a telephone report is recorded, the entire newspaper immediately mobilizes and publishes an extra. When many people walk into the newsroom of a newspaper, they often think that the reporters seem very relaxed, but in fact they are prepared, they are waiting to move at all times, because the most important events are often sudden events.</p>
<p>A political assassination may affect the global situation; the recklessness of a few Japanese soldiers was the beginning of eight years of war. And the people who see the importance of these accidental events, risk their lives at any time to seek the truth, and then faithfully record it, are the news reporters.</p>
<p>Whether it is the fire-hot summer or the freezing winter, they are always ready to mobilize.</p>
<p>And their mobilization order is often the urgent, hurried, and impatient ringing of the telephone bell.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition Market Postponed for Five Days</h3>
<p>The National Products Exhibition Market, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association, was originally scheduled to open on Double Ten Day. The building construction of the venue at No. 444 Nanjing West Road (next to the Ciro's dance hall) has been completed, but in order to allow the national product manufacturers participating in the exhibition to have sufficient time to arrange their exhibits, the market committee decided to postpone it for five days to officially open at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month, so that they can prepare in an unhurried manner and ensure that this national product exhibition, the first one held in this city since the victory of the War of Resistance, reaches a state of perfection.</p>

<h3>Brought Bank Funds to Order Beer; Desperate Over Losses, He Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Zhiqiang (28 years old), from Ningbo, worked in a bank in his hometown. In July, he brought 15 million yuan in legal tender from Ningbo Yixin Bank to Shanghai and stayed with his cousin Wang Zhengwei (residing at No. 46, Shanquan Lane, Longquan Garden Road, Zhejiang Road), intending to order a large quantity of beer from Qingdao in hopes of making a huge profit. Who knew that the losses would reach more than 9 million yuan? So, yesterday, he bought a bottle of Lysol and brought it back to Wang's residence. At around 7:40 PM, he had a moment of weakness and swallowed half a bottle. Wang immediately took him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died at 9:30 PM. It is reported that the deceased has a father who works as an old accountant at the Jiyu Bank in this city.</p>

<p>Also, at around 8:10 PM last night, a newly built temporary wooden and straw shed across from the Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf on Duojia Road in the Southern City caught fire. Cheng Mengchun (34 years old) from Xinghua was gambling with playing cards, and the candle fell over in the firewood pile, suddenly causing a fire. In an instant, the fire blazed high, consuming more than twenty straw sheds. The Fire Department rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about an hour. Cheng Mengchun, the one who started the fire, was taken to the police station for interrogation after the incident by the patrol police.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Police to Extort Money</h3>
<p>The 23rd Regiment of the Military Police arrested Liu Genglin, Shi Dalong, Shi Hengdao, and others yesterday for impersonating military police detectives. They had extorted money from Liu Dean, who ran a restaurant, and then on the night of September 15th, at 11 PM, they went to No. 6009, Yufeng Workshop, Dinghai Road, Yangshupu, with flashlights and wooden sticks. They accused Shi Shida, a fellow worker at the restaurant, of being a bandit, beat him up, and claimed to be acting on the orders of the military police captain, forcibly taking him away and hiding him in the back building at No. 779, Hejian Road. When Commander Wu heard about this, he arrested Liu and the others for investigation.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Mental Confusion</p>
<p>Wei Jianguo asks: My wife is 29 years old. She suffered a shock at the age of 20 and developed mental confusion. She recovered after two months of treatment, but she still suffers from irritability in her chest and cannot sleep peacefully. She even neglects her child while breastfeeding and needs to have both of her pulse points on her wrists tightly bound until her hands become numb and swollen before she returns to normal. This lasts about 10 to 30 minutes each time. I sincerely ask for a cure. (1) What is this disease? (2) Is there any effective medicine that can cure it? (3) Does this disease have any impact on her health?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It may be "Hebephrenic" schizophrenia (i.e., mania). (2) Tincture of valerian or bromide preparations can be tried. Mental and neurological physicians can be consulted (name, address, and fees are not listed). (3) It can cause general weakness.</p>
<p>(2) Persistent Ringworm</p>
<p>Qi Minghua asks: I often suffer from damp-heat eczema, which has persisted for years. Applying Ganlu and other skin disease treatments has little effect. This summer it is even worse, and my arms are covered with spots, as small as prickly heat, which are incredibly itchy and unbearable. There is also a sticky, thick fluid. I don't know what medicine to apply. I am currently injecting calcium gluconate, but I don't know if it will be effective. Please answer the above two questions.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] It is probably scabies. Sulfur ointment and other preparations can be tried. Injecting calcium is an adjunctive treatment that may be helpful.</p>
<p>(3) Congenital Edema</p>
<p>Shi Yuzhi asks: My child was born last July with a congenital deformity. The arms are different in thickness (left is thick, right is thin). After the first month, a soft lump of flesh bulged out from the left side of the neck, without a nucleus. Applying medicine was still ineffective. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it, but recently it has gradually swollen, extending to the throat, seemingly without pain. Repeated consultations have been ineffective. Finally, after examination at Guangci Hospital, it was diagnosed as "congenital lymphedema pain," which requires surgery. I don't know if there is a risk to life. Please answer.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the condition, it is either a cyst or a hematoma. Surgery should be performed, or a test puncture should be performed first, which can be decided by a surgeon.</p>
<h3>Tracing Missing Persons</h3>

<h3>Allocation of Yarn: Director Song Instructs on Policy; Allocation Price to be Based on Original Cost; Municipal Authorities to be Invited to Participate in Supervision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of cotton yarn and cloth in this city has been rising frequently recently, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people, which is not common in Jiangsu. The Allocation Committee of the Cotton Yarn United Association, composed of national and private yarn factories, is also facing increasing difficulties in its joint allocation work due to the widening gap between the allocation price and the black market price. To address this, President Song specially summoned the committee members of national and private yarn factories of the Textile Industry Management Committee yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM. Those present included Dong Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Li Shengbo, Wang Yangxian, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and others. Mayor Wu also participated in the meeting. President Song stated that the first round of yarn allocation by the Joint Allocation Association had been successful and commendable. However, the effectiveness of the second round of allocation was not as good as the first. The recent rise in yarn and cloth prices in Shanghai is attributed to expensive raw materials and the peak season for yarn and cloth sales, which is said to be monopolized. However, another reason is that some private yarn factories did not comply with the allocation price set by the Joint Allocation Association during the second round of allocation. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that all members of the Joint Allocation Association will be self-disciplined and self-managed, and not allow this good organization to exist in name only.</p>
<p>Existing Organization to Maintain the Status Quo Temporarily</p>
<p>Song also earnestly advised that the original joint allocation organization should temporarily maintain the status quo, but its content should be actively strengthened and enriched. At the same time, local governments should be invited to participate in assisting in supervision to ensure that incidents of outward compliance and inward defiance do not happen again. He proposed a trial run of joint yarn allocation.</p>
<p>Unified Allocation and Sales May be Restored</p>
<p>If this is still ineffective, the government will be forced to adopt the unified allocation and purchase methods used in the wartime capital of Chongqing. That is, the government will uniformly purchase raw materials and uniformly allocate them to each factory. For the finished products, the government will give legal profits, uniformly purchase them, and then uniformly allocate them for use. It is reported that President Song agreed to reasonably resolve the opinions raised by the private factories yesterday. For example, the government will try to supply the foreign exchange needed to purchase foreign cotton when necessary. Regarding power supply, it is also actively negotiating to purchase generators in order to increase power generation. The working hours of workers will be restored to pre-war conditions as much as possible.</p>
<p>Increased Production Possible with Resolved Prerequisites</p>
<p>The responsible persons of each factory stated that if the two problems of electricity and working hours can be resolved, the current monthly yarn production of each factory in the city can be increased by one-third, from 60,000 pieces to 90,000 pieces per month. As for the allocation price of joint allocation, Song Zisheng stated that although it does not need to be fixed at one level, he ultimately hopes that the allocation price is reasonable and must not be calculated purely based on the cost of reproduction, but must be based on the original cost. The meeting lasted for more than an hour before the members took their leave.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Control to Prevent Disconnection</p>
<p>In addition, well-informed sources observed that the issue of yarn and cloth allocation in the city in the future will be comprehensively resolved after President Song's instructions to all relevant parties. The price of yarn and cloth, from yarn factories and various replicated product factories to wholesalers and retailers, will be mutually linked and reasonably adjusted, and will not be allowed to be disconnected or surge sharply. It is reported that Mayor Wu's opinion on the yarn and cloth issue in the city in the future is to adopt centralized application and centralized allocation measures in order to simplify the allocation steps and standardize the allocation price. It is reported that Mayor Wu will convene the persons in charge of various yarn factories and cotton yarn replicated product associations in the coming days to jointly study the detailed methods for joint yarn allocation.</p>
<p>Allocation Price Unchanged, Market Price Drops Slightly</p>
<p>The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held its usual yarn meeting yesterday afternoon. It was decided to sell a standard amount of 20-count cotton yarn, with 643 pieces allocated to private factories and 813.5 pieces to the Construction and Development Spinning Company, all allocated according to the application amount. The selling price for 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn remains 1.5 million yuan per piece. The Construction and Development Spinning Company opened eight types of yarn yesterday, of which 32-count and 60-count and below are all spot goods, while 20-count, 40-count, and 42-count are futures. The yarn market turned sharply downwards yesterday. After the opening of the market in the morning, the industry was eager to sell due to tight funds, and the price gradually went downstream. 20-count yarn dropped about 100,000 yuan compared to last weekend, and fine yarn also dropped 150,000 to 70,000 yuan. Customer sales turned silent. Except for the Cantonese merchants slightly adding fine yarn, the Han merchants rarely made any progress. The local weaving factories instead saw sell-offs, also due to tight funds.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Construction and Development Spinning Company's Retail Store on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>The Construction and Development Spinning Company recently prepared a retail store at the original site of the Old Shanghai Store at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Moore Road. The renovation has now been completed, and it is reported that it is scheduled to open on Double Tenth Day.</p>
<h3>After the Resumption of US Dollar Trading, Money Exchange Businesses Have a Market but No Sales; Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on the Black Market</h3>
<p>Money exchange shops that operate in US dollar trading have resumed buying and selling US dollars yesterday, but are restricted by the three US dollar buying and selling methods agreed upon by the municipal government and the central bank. Those who bought at high prices are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to sell. Although there are quite a few people who want to buy at the central bank's exchange rate plus 5%, there are almost no sellers, resulting in the US dollar trading entering a state of stagnation yesterday. The quoted price of money exchange businesses has always been around 3,500 yuan, with no purchases and no sales. It is reported that the transaction price in the dark market has fallen from 4,200 yuan to around 4,000 yuan, and some damaged ones have been traded at 3,800 yuan. All of this is not common. As a result, it has fallen compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong bills have shrunk to 107 yuan due to the need for Shanghai reports, but the city's funds are tight. Therefore, although the opening rose to 920 yuan, it fell back to 860 yuan in the middle, and finally stood at the 900 yuan mark, resulting in another increase of 40 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was reported at 930 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 1,130 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 14,500 yuan, all affected by the sharp drop in the Hong Kong Shanghai bill market, but there were very few transactions. There are still few transactions in the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the Police Bureau has been ordered by Mayor Wu that anyone who illegally buys and sells US dollars on the black market will be cracked down on and severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>President Song of the Executive Yuan received Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, at the office at 9 AM yesterday to inquire about matters related to suppressing the US dollar.</p>
<h3>Resale of Allocated Yarn: Allocation Suspended to 14 Companies Yesterday; New Light Claims It Was an Exchange, Not Profiteering</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the resale of allocated yarn by the New Light Underwear Factory, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the factory, who stated as follows: The factory currently has 176 looms, requiring approximately 300 pieces of 42-count and 40-count yarn per month (20-count yarn and the thread needed for underwear are not included). In September, the factory applied for and received 23 pieces from the Construction and Development Spinning Company, which was far too short. Therefore, it had to be purchased from the black market. It also claimed that on September 9th, one piece of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn obtained from the Construction and Development Spinning Company had to be delivered from the Wusong Yunpingbang Factory. Beforehand, it was necessary to go to the factory to assign the goods and indicate the date before they could be picked up, but the round-trip transportation costs and time were not cost-effective, and the factory was in urgent need. Therefore, Zhang Jun from the Datai Yarn Shop (who usually handled the replacement of missing yarn) volunteered to exchange it for the same spot goods and issued a certificate. Therefore, it was not comparable to reselling for profit. However, Shi Xinquan, the specialist from the Construction and Development Spinning Company who investigated the case, stated that since the price of yarn soared, the Construction and Development Spinning Company had to take emergency measures to temporarily limit the allocation to actual users in order to balance the market and maintain industrial production, so as not to affect the suspension of replica production. This measure was originally a temporary expedient. At the same time, the company actively increased spindles and increased production, painstakingly maintaining. However, some small manufacturers not only did not engage in increased production with the allocated cotton yarn, but instead sold it on the black market, which is regrettable. After receiving the notification, the company immediately started investigating the facts and has now concluded the investigation. There are as many as 14 companies, including New Light, Dashi, Dachang, Huafu, Rongxin, Wanshun, Qinyu, Hongxiang, Shengsheng, Rongfeng, Huaguang, Tongmengxiang, Yihua, and Taichang. In addition to suspending the allocation to the above factories, the competent authorities are studying countermeasures to prevent recurrence.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The cloth market yesterday was characterized by customer sales taking a wait-and-see attitude and tight funds, so there were few transactions and the price also gradually declined. The Longtou fine cloth opened by the Construction and Development Spinning Company on Saturday opened at 86,500 yuan, and then dropped to 86,000 yuan. The market situation is still trending towards weariness.</p>
<h3>Different Views on Cocoon Purchase Price: Silk Capital Too High, Purchase Price Should be Increased; Already Exceeding Selling Price, Further Increase is Not Appropriate</h3>
<p>According to silk industry sources, this year's autumn silkworms only yielded more than 8,000 loads of dried cocoons, which was unexpectedly small. The current purchase price is 180,000 yuan per load of fresh cocoons, which is equivalent to 480,000 yuan when made into dried cocoons. Adding expenses and by-product costs, it actually requires 700,000 yuan per load. 5.5 loads of dried cocoons produce one load of raw silk, and the cost of a single load is 700,000 yuan. Adding three months of interest calculated at 2.5% requires 300,000 yuan. The total cost of each load of raw silk is at least 4.8 million yuan. However, the China Trust Bureau's third batch of spring cocoon purchase price is still set at 3.8 million yuan per load, and only 2,600 loads have been purchased. The association specially convened a board meeting last Saturday to discuss the results and decided to request the competent authorities to slightly increase the limit price for the purchase of raw silk, adding 400,000 yuan per load for each grade of ABCD to encourage manufacturers to produce more high-quality raw silk and benefit exports. This suggestion was formally submitted to the China Trust Bureau yesterday. However, the bureau believes that the current purchase price is already 20% to 30% higher compared to the foreign silk market price and cannot be increased further. However, famous manufacturers argued that the current cost of the silk market is inherently high. If the price is not adjusted quickly, they will be unable to bear it.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Falls Back</h3>
<p>The price of gold yesterday was still controlled by the central bank and tended to be weak. The opening price was 2.17 million yuan, and immediately after opening, it gradually went downstream from 2.18 million yuan. After 10 AM, the central bank allocated 20 bars at a price of 2.16 million yuan, which was extremely stable at this time, just hovering. Later, funds became tighter, and the pressure of cutting and selling became increasingly severe. Supply exceeded demand, and it retreated to around 2.14 million yuan at noon before it stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the situation of overnight delivery stabilized, and finally rose to around 2.165 million yuan, resulting in a drop of 30,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Decorative gold fell to 30,000 yuan, patterned silver remained unchanged, silver dollars rose to over 2,000 yuan, and the secret rate of funds became even tighter, with secret interest ranging from 2.6% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Longs Exit, Public Bonds Plummet</h3>
<p>Public bonds were extremely tight yesterday. A certain major player with the surname Lou cut more than 3 million yuan. The price of Unified C opened at 2,600 yuan and immediately retreated, gradually declining. Although there was some hovering in the middle, the overall trend was to sell, making it impossible to cheer up. Near noon, it once fell below 1,870 yuan before it turned flat. It recovered to 1,950 yuan at noon, resulting in a huge drop of 650 yuan compared to last Saturday. Unified A and B rose by 50 yuan, Unified D rose by 100 yuan, and Unified E remained flat.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Route Cargo Shipping Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the customs announced the prohibition of cotton yarn and cotton cloth shipping to the Min and Yue provinces via the sea route, the cargo on each ship has been sluggish. Yesterday, the Zengde ship sailed to Guangdong, also stopping at Xiamen. Only 220 pieces of local cloth, 1,000 pieces of bean cake, 870 boxes of cigarettes, and approximately 2,100 pieces of miscellaneous goods and medicinal materials were transported to Guangdong. 11,000+ bags of bran, 1,200 bags of wheat, 4,170 pieces of bean cake, 880 bags of beans, and 1,700+ pieces of miscellaneous goods were transported to Xiamen. In addition, the customs ship transported oil heads, 400+ bags of beans, 130+ bags of sesame seeds, 2,700+ pieces of bean cake, 1,670+ bags of bran, 675 pieces of peanut cake, 300 bags of fertilizer powder, and 2,000+ bags of miscellaneous goods.</p>
<h3>Is the Economic Downturn Coming? Predictions by British and American Economists</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] According to economists, observing the recent situation, there will be a trend of economic downturn in the United States in the late 1947 or early 1948, but the situation will not be serious and will not last long. According to Hegen, an economic expert at the National Design Association, the current gradual increase in inventory is a sign that supply has gradually adapted to demand.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 6th] According to the "Financial Times," some people have suggested that the recent plunge in the London and New York stock markets is similar to the situation in 1920, with the possibility of repeating the past. However, the newspaper expressed the opinion that the main factors of this plunge are completely different from the past.</p>
<h3>Fuel Control: President Song Reviews Again; Summoned Xu Letian and Zhao Zengyu to Inquire</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, the market price of white coal has skyrocketed, mainly due to the imminent winter season, and holders are taking advantage of the scarcity of white coal arriving in Shanghai to hoard and raise prices. However, although the market price is high, there are very few transactions. Xu Letian, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, revealed to reporters yesterday that since the committee began to collect and transport white coal to supply the city's winter needs, it is now confirmed that a batch of more than 1,800 tons of large pieces from Hongji, Vietnam, has arrived in Shanghai and will continue to be loaded. American white coal is also being loaded. The Fuel Management Committee also stated to reporters that white coal blocks are only for use by restaurants and wealthy families for winter heating, and the use is limited. The rise and fall of market prices has little impact on people's livelihood. The committee has long supplied a large amount of white coal dust needed for fuel for daily use. Therefore, the market price of coal balls has been stable for a long time. It is hoped that general white coal block users will not engage in high-price searches. Soon, when a large amount of white coal arrives in Shanghai and is sold at a flat price, they will suffer losses.</p>
<p>President Song Ziwén of the Executive Yuan summoned Xu Letian, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, and Zhao Zengyu, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday to inquire in detail about the fuel control situation in the city, as well as the amount of coal arriving and the supply situation, and held a meeting. It is said that regarding the fuel control issue, the Municipal Council believes that the results of controlling fuel have had a significant impact on industry, commerce, and the general public, and unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to abolish fuel control and allow merchants to collect and purchase it themselves. Mr. Song summoned Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhao to conduct a special review of this and decide whether fuel control needs to be continued or abolished.</p>
<h3>White Coal Sees High Prices Again</h3>
<p>The white coal market has seen most of the scattered coal blocks in hand sold out successively. Therefore, a shortage of white coal blocks has reappeared in the market, and the trend of price increases is again prevalent. All goods are showing new high prices. Due to the Fuel Committee's restrictions on coal ball factories from applying to purchase raw coal starting this month, and with coal ball factories currently in a period of strong sales, they are short of raw materials and can only search for them in the coal market. As a result, market prices have suddenly risen.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Rumors Abound, Stock Market Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was greatly affected by tight money. As soon as the market opened, stocks generally fell. After the opening, they quickly rebounded from the low, but after various stocks rose, they were still met with profit-taking and could not sustain the gains. From 10:20 AM, the situation gradually stabilized, with the Guangdong and Northern trading houses entering the market, gradually rebounding. At 10:35 AM, a major player from a securities firm heavily invested in Wing On Cotton Mill and American Asiatic Company, and Guangdong interests also bought Wing On Cotton Mill, causing the market to improve again. However, around 11:00 AM, stocks still retreated under gradual selling pressure, and the weakness extended to 11:20 AM. Sichuan trading houses made significant purchases, and retail investors and short covering added momentum, causing various stocks to rise sharply. Wing On Cotton Mill rose to the 800 yuan level, and American Asiatic Company reached 4450 yuan. Apart from these two major stocks, only Sino-British remained high. The others did not show any improvement and remained followers. After 11:30 AM, high prices gradually fell back as profitable positions were sold. A major securities player and Northern trading houses who had initially entered the market in the morning sold off. Coupled with rumors of problems at Commercial Bank deposits, market sentiment became even more fearful, and long positions were relentlessly liquidated. Wing On Cotton Mill fell to a low of 769 yuan. American Asiatic Company briefly approached the morning low of 4230 yuan before temporarily stopping. At the close, retail investors and short covering provided support, slightly pulling up prices. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Cotton Mill, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by half a percent, American Asiatic Company by slightly less than three-tenths of a percent, Sino-British down half a percent, China Textile, Tong Pen, Match, Asia Li, Lou Interior, Cement, and Jing 緰 each down slightly more than half a percent, China Silk alone remained flat, Wuhe Company slightly declined, and Datong Huafeng fell by about 10%. The total trading volume was 11.4 million shares. Off-exchange stocks also experienced slight declines. Chuxu stocks also fell. Except for Ye Guang, most stocks were sluggish. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yisheng and Yinglian each fell by half a percent. Paper, Shipping, Copper, Jardine Matheson, and Yibier although decreased were not as much. Ye Guang slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Rayon Stable, Yesterday's Closing Price Maintained</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable. 120-count Tianqiao rayon with luster maintained last Saturday's closing price of 3.7 million yuan. Non-branded rayon differed by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Semi-lustrous rayon traded at 3.5 million to 3.4 million yuan. 150-count rayon with luster was priced similar to 120-count semi-lustrous rayon. 150-count and 75-count semi-lustrous rayon were both offered at 2.89 million yuan. Factory agents were also very stable. Yesterday's asking prices were slightly weaker than last weekend, but transactions were rare. Because the spot market was very stable, silk houses were greatly concerned that it would be difficult to replenish their stock after selling, leading to a lack of trading. According to industry insiders, there are currently very few non-industry holders of goods, so there is no speculative activity, and the market price will not fluctuate. Sleep silk continued to weaken, and Sheng Hang goods all saw price declines.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Reaffirms Ban on Using Foreign Currency to Pay for Imports</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of using foreign currency to pay for imported goods, the Central Bank recently issued Circular No. 58 to all designated foreign exchange banks, reaffirming its previous order as follows: The Central Bank had previously issued Circular No. 45 on June 15, informing all designated banks handling foreign exchange not to accept foreign currency to offset the value of imported goods and other needs. According to confirmed investigations, merchants have been buying foreign currency in the open market to assist in this practice. A warning is issued to merchants who have purchased foreign exchange from these banks that they must not accept foreign currency to pay for goods in the future, nor may they purchase foreign currency. Anyone found to be in violation of this prohibition will be prohibited from participating in any foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Supply Continuous, Japonica and Indica Both Slightly Decline, Grain Review Committee Decides to Maintain Original Prices</h3>
<p>The rice market supply is still acceptable, with a total registered volume of over 13,000 shi of rice. Market conditions were firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. As a result, both japonica and indica rice declined slightly by 1,000 yuan. However, white yuan rice was scarce and actively traded, with prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Taiwan rice continued to be allocated 700 bags, and prices remained the same. There were no wheat transactions today. Because the authorities are closely monitoring it, there were no domestic flour transactions. Wheat bran from this region and the Zhejiang route was very active, rising by another 300 to 500 yuan. Soybean arrivals were slow, but consumption was acceptable. High-quality vegetable cake was actively traded, with prices rising by 300 to 500 yuan. Mung beans were similar. Sesame remained flat. Red sorghum stopped rising and declined, falling slightly by 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas were initially seen, and raw peanuts, after a sharp decline, experienced sporadic activity. Shops opportunistically picked up some, causing prices to rebound by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. New goods were priced 6,000 to 7,000 yuan higher.苟 rice was 500 to 600 yuan lower. There was still a large allocation of oil. Soybean oil was stable, rapeseed oil was stable at less than one thousand, and raw oil declined by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In other news, it is reported that Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang has gone to the Zhenjiang and Suzhou areas to implement strict controls. Rice prices in that area have shown a recovery. According to Director Ji of the Grain Section, the Grain Review Committee held today (8th) "decided to maintain the original prices."</p>

<h3>Aged Black Tea Has Sales, White Head Trading House Has Good Appetite</h3>
<p>Since B.O.P grade Taiwan fine black tea has been out of stock for a long time, local tea factories have begun to imitate it. It is heard that buyers are currently inspecting the tea and are satisfied with its export potential, but the prices offered are extremely low, making it difficult to start trading for the time being. As for the aged special tribute and aged warm black tea that Yulong Foreign Firm and Bonlong Tea Shop once negotiated about last week, a satisfactory resolution has been reached. A total of more than 200 boxes have been traded. According to industry insiders, the White Head Trading House still has an appetite for the above-mentioned varieties.</p>

<p>[Our city dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently issued a notice to all municipal national schools stating: "The school year has been in session for a month, and the school's enrollment should have been determined. According to the Bureau's regulations, each school should aim for an average of 50 students per grade (including elementary school classes, pre-school classes, and national education classes). If the school's current student count is not full, it should immediately find a way to recruit more students or apply to the Bureau to adjust the grade levels to comply with the regulations and save municipal funds. If there is insufficient enrollment or any falsification of reports, once discovered, the funds already received will be recovered, and disciplinary action will be taken. You are hereby notified to comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Inspectors Sun and Wang of the Ministry of Education Report on the Educational Situation in Taiwan Province, Students' Actions and Attitudes Are Already Japanized</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch] After Taiwan Province returned to the motherland, the Ministry of Education attached great importance to education in the province and specially sent inspectors Wang Peiren and Sun Xiatang to inspect it. They have now completed their inspection and returned to the ministry to report on the educational situation in Taiwan Province and its advantages. The key points of their inspection report are summarized below:</p>
<p>Eighty-Two Out of One Hundred Children Attend School</p>
<p>Since its restoration in November last year, Taiwan has worked hard to popularize the national language, promote the Three Principles of the People, and promote China's inherent moral spirit. It is also aware of the efforts to eliminate the poisonous legacy of Japanese education in order to conform to China's educational system and laws and achieve "Sinicization." At present, schools at all levels have been generally adjusted. There are currently provincial educational institutions, including one normal school, one law and business school, one vocational school, one agricultural school, four normal schools, 38 middle schools, four vocational schools, nine agricultural schools, seven commercial schools, two fishery schools, eight provincial national schools, three provincial folk education centers, one library, one local museum, one national language promotion committee, one language supplementary school, eleven national language promotion centers, and a total of ten industrial technology and supplementary schools, and two schools for the blind and deaf. The above includes four provincial higher education institutions, 69 secondary education institutions, eight national schools, and three social education institutions. As for county and city-level and private educational institutions, there are 75 county and city middle schools, 44 vocational schools, nine private middle schools, ten private vocational schools, and 1,031 national schools. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Education, the number of children enrolled in school accounts for 82.75% of the school-age children. Social education institutions at the county and city level are being planned, and only Tainan County has established a folk education center. However, libraries are very common in counties and cities, with eight county libraries, municipal libraries, and 83 public and three private libraries.</p>
<p>Education Expenses Account for 30% of the Budget</p>
<p>School buildings and equipment at all levels are better than those in the interior. Even the school buildings of national schools in the countryside are mostly magnificent and rich, but in wartime, or have not been repaired for a long time, or have been bombed, and damaged and collapsed buildings are everywhere. Because they have been educated by the Japanese for a long time, the students are mostly thrifty and polite. All their actions and attitudes have been Japanized. They are neat and strict, but they lack vitality and initiative. The teachers in various places have an excellent spirit of service. Even if they have only received a small amount of maintenance funds for three or four months, they still go to school on time to teach every day. However, before the restoration, most of the teachers in various schools were Japanese. Although there were teachers from the mainland here after the restoration, there were not many, and most of the teachers were Taiwanese. During the Japanese rule, the Taiwanese were restricted from receiving normal education, so there are many unqualified teachers now. For example, in national schools in various places, only three to five people in each school have graduated from normal school. Regarding education funding, according to the 35th-year (April to December) provisional expenditure budget of the Education Department of the Provincial Governor's Office, the income section is tuition, totaling 1,740,000 Taiwan dollars, the regular expenditure is 66,605,431 Taiwan dollars, and the temporary expenditure is 103,036,010 Taiwan dollars. On average, education expenses in each county and city account for about 30% of the budget.</p>
<p>The Father-Brother Association is of Great Help to the School</p>
<p>After the inspection, inspectors Wang and Sun believe that the advantages of Taiwan's education can be summarized as follows: (1) The province pays attention to the training and lectures of primary and secondary school teachers, and the provincial and county administrative authorities can work hard to promote them. (2) The calculation method of the salary of educational workers at the provincial and county levels is the same, and it is the same as that of civil servants in various departments. The salary is fair, and there are no complaints from superiors and subordinates. (3) Most of the teachers in grade schools can arrive at school on time every day and return home on time, and their spirit of service is commendable. (4) The school buildings at all levels are magnificent and the equipment is good. There are some schools whose scale and equipment are not available in the country. (5) Most of the students are simple and can abide by discipline and know etiquette. (6) Local employees and students are working hard to learn the national language. (7) Vocational education in various parts of the province is very developed, and all facilities are better than those in the mainland. (8) Public and private libraries are lined up in various places, which is convenient for students and the public to read. (9) Gentlemen and student parents have a Father-Brother Association organization for the school in the location, which is of great help to the school.</p>
<h3>Municipal Elementary Schools Collect Teacher Respect Money, Yesterday's Declaration Stated</h3>
<p>The Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association has made a statement regarding the collection of teacher respect money. The declaration issued yesterday stated the following in general terms: Since the victory, we have exhausted our efforts and voices to呼薇 for the treatment of . However, the answer that the country and society have given us is only verbal sympathy and a small favor. When we consider Chairman Jiang’s slogan of "Education First," we cannot help but sigh up to the sky and bow our heads! This semester, the Municipal Education Bureau sympathized with our Qing difficulties and had no authority to adjust living expenses. Therefore, it continued the name of teacher respect money from the previous semester and ordered each school to collect teacher respect money. This method is something that we ourselves feel is putting the cart before the horse and does not help the matter. It is not the true meaning of the repeated appeals of the Association colleagues. However, for the sincerity of the Municipal Education authorities to seek perfection, the Association colleagues urgently waited to die, so they first followed the order to collect money to solve the urgent need. As for the request to rationally adjust the treatment, it will not only not be suspended because of this, but will also achieve the goal of success in the shortest time. We hereby inform all the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters in the city that our collection of teacher respect money is an emergency treatment method. We hope that this is the last time. We hope that reasonable treatment of the root cause will be adjusted immediately so that we can serve with peace of mind. We also hope that people from all walks of life will give assistance so that our wishes can be realized soon. Then education is fortunate! Colleagues are fortunate!</p>

<h3>This Year's Football League Registration Deadline Tomorrow; Football Committee Chairman Jiang Xiangqing Expresses Sentiments</h3>
<p>Registration for new and old members of this year's football league has been underway since it began. As of yesterday, eight old member units and over twenty new member units have completed the procedures. The registration deadline is set for tomorrow (the 9th). Furthermore, Football Committee Chairman Jiang Xiangqing expressed the following sentiments yesterday:</p>
<p>This season, most of the Division A teams have encountered unprecedented difficulties, with many struggling to form teams. Examining the reasons, there are three main factors: veteran players are gradually retiring, and there is a lack of successors; some players have changed their service areas; and the sponsors of various teams lack the strength to support them. Being elected as chairman at this time, I deeply feel the weight of the responsibility and the long road ahead. I will dedicate my efforts to the best of my ability and work with all the committee members to shoulder the arduous task. After the registration deadline, the committee will send letters to solicit opinions from each team, hoping that each team can embody the spirit of harmony and cooperation, express well-intentioned suggestions, so that both the teams and the league can benefit in the future. The biggest crisis for football in this city after the war is the failure to restore school leagues, resulting in a lack of new talent. If school sports are silent, then social sports will inevitably decline in their later years. Therefore, social sports should start with school sports.</p>
<h3>News from Overseas Chinese Education in Southeast Asia: 600 Overseas Chinese Schools in Vietnam Recover; Over 2,000 Schools in Malaya Return to Operation; Nearly 300 More Schools Added in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the education of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. It has sent personnel to Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies to inspect the situation. According to recent surveys of overseas Chinese education in these areas: (1) Vietnam: There are approximately 600,000 overseas Chinese, with over 700 overseas Chinese schools before the war.

<h3>Taiwan Tea in a State of Decline</h3>
<p>— Taiwan Air Mail News, 18th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taiwan's special products are now uniformly showing a state of declining production and sales. People love to recall the numbers from the Japanese rule era. For example, in 1940, the total amount of special products imported was 408,650 (unit: thousand yen), and the export was 592,390. Oolong tea, which is famous, accounted for 3.6% of the total export. In 1943, the export value was 22,652 yuan (unit: thousand yen), second only to rice and sugar. This illustrates the golden age of Taiwan's trade and the position of tea in the overall export.</p>
<p>However, in the one year from the restoration to the present, tea can be said to have completely stagnated, with no production and no sales. Recently, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have successively purchased 100,000 pounds of aged tea, and it is generally believed that Taiwan tea has regained the international market. However, knowledgeable people believe that without starting from the basics, it is difficult to maintain normal international trade permanently. The current stage is the beginning of the tea industry's vitality, but it is also the end of its melancholy.</p>
<p>Both Government-Operated and Private Enterprises Have Strong Strength</p>
<p>The main varieties of Taiwan tea are Baozhong tea, Oolong tea, and black tea. Brick tea is only a by-product for sale to the Soviet Union. There are also several types of green tea. Because it is incompatible with the planting in Japan, Taiwan, which is suitable in terms of climate and geography, has focused on the planting and harvesting of pure black tea in the past.</p>
<p>Japanese companies that attempted to monopolize the tea industry here, such as Mitsui, Tokumoto, Toyoko, Sansho, Taiwan Agriculture, and other joint-stock companies, as well as Toya, Narooka Shoten, and Nozawa Gumi Taipei Branch, owned a tea plantation area of 3,145 Jia (equivalent to over 48,000 mu in mainland China), which were all taken over by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In addition, there are two experiment stations and one tea training institute. The eight units that were taken over were merged by the government into the Taiwan Tea Corporation. Currently, they have three refining factories, one of which is not in operation, and fourteen crude tea factories, ten of which are in operation, and four of which are still shut down due to damaged machinery. The tea training institute, which has been closed for three or four years, according to the person in charge of the tea section, is preparing to enroll students in October of this year, with one term per year, to train new tea cadres. It has over twenty Jia of tea plantations and a practical factory, which is exclusively for the students to practice in and is currently under renovation. Private tea companies also had great power in the past. They have trade associations and also corporate tea companies, mainly to avoid the manipulation and exploitation of foreign companies and middlemen. Through the organization of tea farmers throughout the province, in February of this year, they merged the Taiwan Tea Export Joint-Stock Company, Taiwan Packaging Container Manufacturing Joint-Stock Company, and Taiwan Brick Tea Joint-Stock Company, and acquired all the shares of Xingnan and Pengnan Companies. The company has the province's only brick tea machinery and skilled workers. Before the war, there were over a hundred tea merchants, and now there are over seventy, owning 37,653 Jia of tea plantations (equivalent to 180,000 mu in mainland China), 213 crude tea factories, and 80 refined tea factories.</p>
<p>Both the government and private sectors have laid the foundation for the international trade of Taiwan tea. Until after the war, exports were affected due to maritime transportation, and production greatly decreased. The bleak picture of the tea industry last year and this year is truly unbearable to recall!</p>
<p>Tea Merchants and Tea Farmers Suffer Greatly</p>
<p>Taiwan once had the honor of being the "Kingdom of Spices." It had large-scale production of camphor and essential oils, as well as jasmine, gardenia, and other fragrance crops, which were used for large-scale intercropping in the tea industry. The Japanese government's incentives for the tea industry were machine subsidies, fertilizer rationing, variety improvement, and the establishment of training institutes. They also established appraisal meetings for tea plantations in mountainous areas to seek improvements in technology. What was particularly important was that 95% of Oolong tea was sold to Britain and the United States, and they spent 200,000 to 300,000 yuan on advertising in their tea shops every year. At the same time, the bonuses for sales to third countries were as high as 6 million yuan. In 1938 and 1939, when exports exceeded 10 million catties, the subsidy per catty was 7 yuan, and taxes were exempted. The Japanese policy was effective in encouraging the export of Taiwan tea.</p>
<p>Wang Tian Deng, chairman of the Tea Industry Association, and Lin Chao Ming told reporters painfully: "The province could originally produce 20 million catties of tea per year, and the province's consumption was 1 million catties. Recently, it has plummeted to only 4 million catties. The tea farmers in Taipei County and Hsinchu County have abandoned the habit of growing tea for over 80 years (Taiwan's tea trade with Britain and the United States began in 1909). Because of the impact of the war, the tea mountains have all been abandoned. In Taipei alone, over 30,000 people have lost their jobs directly or indirectly. He has repeatedly requested the government to provide incentives, abolish the donations and taxes levied on tea plantations, and think of more ways to improve transportation and planting, but he has not received any concrete results." Then, with a pessimistic attitude, he said: "The farmers have no way to pay taxes, and the abandonment of tea plantations is impossible to reverse in a short time!" The reporter also visited the formerly famous Dadaocheng factory, where only a few workers were picking aged tea next to the stalled machines, and the scene was extremely desolate. They are now working to organize a unified organization for the cultivation, manufacturing, and trade of Taiwan tea, and to establish a tea company jointly run by the government and private sectors to develop the world market, and to establish an evaluation, guidance, and production material purchasing and transportation committee, with a capital of 100 million yuan. It is believed that with the effective cooperation of the government and the private sector, it will be beneficial to the development of Taiwan tea.</p>

<h3>Calamity Invades Rural Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Airmail News, September 18, Our Nanchang Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>The disasters in Jiangxi are truly unspeakable and cannot be fully described. After enduring eight years of banditry, coupled with eight years of war, the people were scattered in foreign lands. After returning after the war, their own houses were burned down by the enemy. Without houses to live in, everyone squeezed into smelly and dirty toilets or under dilapidated eaves to shelter from the wind and rain, lacking clothing and food. In the lean season, the jade-yellow grains in the people's barns were all gone in order to pay military rations. Unable to bear the hunger, they ate Guanyin soil and gnawed on tree bark. Readers are familiar with these tragic realities.</p>
<p>Looking at a dyed map of the disaster area in Jiangxi, the disaster situation in southeastern Jiangxi, although not as severe as in the northwest region, currently has a more severe calamity invading the ravaged rural areas.</p>
<p>Nancheng is a strategic stronghold in southeastern Jiangxi and a transportation hub for Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The houses there suffered destruction by the enemy. According to a recent survey report by the county government, a total of over 5,000 buildings were destroyed, accounting for about 90% of the original houses in the city. The returning people had no choice but to build huts on the ruins of tiles and rubble in the unmanned weeds to live in. After the calamity, Nancheng encountered a rat plague, which harmed the lives of many poor people.</p>
<p>Pest infestations and cattle plagues in rural southern Jiangxi, due to the lack of knowledge of farmers and insufficient medical equipment, although farmers in various parts of southern Jiangxi are hoping for a bumper harvest this year, they have unfortunately suffered such unexpected disasters.</p>
<p>The destruction in Ji'an was caused by the enemy's last scavenging battle on the Chinese battlefield on the eve of victory. At that time, the enemy knew that they would suffer a devastating defeat, so the people in the areas they passed through were subjected to the inhuman burning, killing, and destruction by the Japanese devils. As a result, 5,500 houses in Ji'an were burned down, and 2,400 head of cattle were killed.</p>
<p>The northwestern part of Jiangxi is the corner of Jiangxi that has been ravaged by the enemy for the longest time. The city of Gaoan, which straddles the Jinjiang River, was completely destroyed. Weeds and garbage have submerged the original streets. Fengxin, De'an, Shanggao... the entire rural area was reduced to ruins, leaving only a few roofless and doorless dilapidated houses, writing the tragic history of the Japanese devils' atrocities in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster in Jiangxi, the people on the hunger line, the current stage of post-disaster relief, in recent days, we have visited the disaster areas and also approached people in the community, listening to general reports, feeling that although Jiangxi's disaster relief work has not yet reached the ideal, there are indeed some facts that show their efforts.</p>
<p>For example: the first phase of emergency rural relief in Nanchang, Xinjian, Yongxiu, and other counties, assisted farmers in resuming cultivation, allowing the returning people with empty hands to have farmhouses to live in and cattle and agricultural tools to help them cultivate, opening up years of barren land, which has solved part of the food problem this year.</p>
<p>The special water conservancy fund of 10 million yuan repaired the long-neglected Ganjiang River dike and various dike gates in the three counties of Nan, Xin, and Yong, completing a total of 282 breaches, 189 dangerous sections, and 100 culvert gates, benefiting a total of 765,520 mu of farmland. It is now also cooperating with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission Jiangxi District Breach Closure and Dike Restoration Engineering Office to strengthen the restoration of the Ganjiang River and Bin Hu dikes in the form of work relief. According to the Engineering Office's report, the repaired dikes have a length of 27,133,210,050 meters and a volume of 2,365,350 cubic meters of earthwork, benefiting 3,459,620 mu of farmland in the city.</p>
<p>This year, the Ganjiang River has flooded several times, and the highest point of the water level is only a few inches away from the dike surface. The dikes in each section are secured without incident, which is a great help to Jiangxi's bumper harvest this year, and the rural areas have truly received the benefits of relief.</p>
<p>The current relief is focused on the countryside, and the future post-disaster reconstruction is still in the countryside. Because the masses of poor people are in a corner outside the cities, where people are reaching out their hands in need of relief. Director Cai Mengjian talked about Jiangxi's future relief work, saying: "The actual promoters of Jiangxi's relief work are the work teams, and the groups and offices of the branch office are just the 'command post' of this work. Currently, the tasks of the work teams can be divided into six categories based on the most urgent needs: (1) agricultural relief, (2) emergency relief, (3) social welfare, (4) sanitation, (5) flood and drought prevention, and (6) construction of various public buildings." Cai also emphasized the seriousness of the abandonment of farmland in Jiangxi, which should be strengthened through reclamation and recultivation to increase production. Therefore, the branch office has now decided to establish a demonstration farm in the Zhanggongdu area of Yongxiu County, which has the most barren land. The barren land area has already been measured, and 5,000 mu will be developed in the first phase, and it will be expanded to 10,000 mu in the second phase. In the future, the latest type of agricultural tools from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration may be used to carry out this land reclamation work.</p>
<p>Currently, those who are in charge of post-disaster relief work in Jiangxi are encountering several difficult to overcome difficulties: First, there are too few relief materials. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally planned to allocate 15,000 tons of materials to Jiangxi every month, but from November last year to the present, only 10,000 tons of materials have been transported to Jiujiang, which is less than one-tenth of the original budget.</p>
<p>Second, transportation is difficult. The lack of transportation in Jiangxi is currently extremely difficult. By making the most of water and land transportation, the monthly transportation volume is only 5,000 tons, not to mention the rural areas that are not accessible by boat or car, which must rely on manual carrying!</p>
<p>Third, funding has been reduced. The funds approved by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for Jiangxi were originally 700 million yuan per month, but because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration itself is experiencing financial difficulties, since August, the funding for the Jiangxi branch has been reduced to 400 million yuan. If the transportation cost of 10,000 tons of materials per month requires 500 million yuan, the total monthly funding of 400 million yuan is not enough for the transportation cost of 10,000 tons of materials. How can we talk about post-disaster reconstruction?</p>
<p>Therefore, the elders of Jiangxi unanimously hope that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can allocate more suitable materials to alleviate the current poverty in the countryside and the lives of the 2 million people in need of relief.</p>

<h3>Typhoon Disaster Area</h3>
<p>The Trip to Alishan Was Aborted Midway</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Chiayi in central Taiwan on the 24th and immediately went to Xinying, where the Tainan County Government is located. The reporter stayed overnight in this small town, and just before returning to Chiayi City at 2:00 PM on the 25th, yellow sand had been blowing for several days, making it difficult to open one's eyes. We thought it was the usual gray sand in the south, but when we returned to the city, the radio had issued an emergency warning: "Typhoon hitting Taiwan!"</p>
<p>The typhoon was discovered 200 kilometers off the island on the 24th. People on the island are accustomed to such special products, but they did not expect that it would land in Taitung and the southern tip of Hengchun at a wind speed of 35 meters per second, bringing great terror to the people of the province.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, wind and rain were raging. The reporters squatted in a newly built hotel. The wooden house under Liu Zilin opposite was blown down, and its slender body was also bent over. The top of the building was shaking, and the raindrops outside the window, no matter how tightly you closed the wooden window, still dripped and floated into the room, hitting it hard. In this dangerous building, the reporter thought of his home in Taipei, and his wife and children were probably hugging each other, thinking of their husband traveling south!</p>
<p>The rain stopped for a while, and the wind also temporarily subsided. We prepared to rush to our scheduled route, a trip to the Alishan Forest Area. We arrived at the station of the Taiwan Development Company, and suddenly the rain came again, and the wind speed was stronger and fiercer than before. We did not reduce our courage to go up the mountain, and still took the specially prepared gasoline car and moved forward against the wind. The raindrops hit our cheeks like pieces of ice scars; the wind, the wind blowing from the sea, dragged the gasoline car like a whirlwind, and the driver was paying attention to the brakes with his life. We were soaked all over. We no longer believed the words that there was no risk beyond two stations, and we turned back. According to the stationmaster's report, this was really a risky trip. Uneven stones had fallen from the mountain and blocked the vehicles from moving forward. People often easily sacrifice their lives in this situation. The weather bureau's report was: "The strong typhoon 955 (M·B·) 716 (W·M·) is currently at 19.5 degrees north latitude and 131.5 degrees east longitude, that is, 1,000 kilometers southeast of Okinawa in the sea, moving northwest and approaching Okinawa. The speed of the center's movement is 25 kilometers per hour!"</p>
<p>Emergency Measures</p>
<p>The reporter first visited Lu Guan Qun, president of the China Daily. He said sadly, "It's a drop in the bucket." The typhoon blew away the roof of the newspaper office in the typhoon disaster area. The president's office and the editorial department were flooded to the knees, and you could row a boat. There was no electricity, and the newspaper had not been published for two days. He was dizzy with worry. He said that the China Daily was the most disaster-ridden, but he still mustered all his courage and finally resumed publication on the 28th. The repair costs alone required more than 200,000 Taiwan dollars. For the sake of the newspaper, he had hardly slept since the wind started blowing.</p>
<p>Tainan Mayor Zhuo Gao Xuan issued an emergency announcement one hour after the typhoon stopped, providing free hospital treatment for the injured, reporting deaths for compensation, and sending the homeless to relief homes. In a short time, he obtained several figures: four deaths, the destruction of national schools in central and southern districts of the city, and general crop losses below 50%. In Qigu District, 25 salt workers were swept away by the waves, and the number of missing people was unknown. In Chenggong's mother's home for the elderly, the Kaiyuan Temple, an ancient tree with a history of over 200 years, was cut down by the wind. In Qigu District alone, the losses were over 40 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the southern city of Kaohsiung, boats salvaged by the Port Bureau were washed into the sea by the waves and were salvaged overnight. The factories, schools, and houses destroyed cost more than 20 million yuan. In the county area, sugarcane fields, tobacco seedlings, and sweet potatoes were all destroyed. Sugarcane fields could only preserve seedlings, and over 45,000 mu of rice crops were damaged by more than 40%. However, the locust plague given by nature was extinguished. Nature overcame nature, and humans seemed small and fragile here.</p>
<p>The director of the Tainan Weather Station said that this was an unprecedented disaster in central and southern Taiwan in the past 35 years, but the north and east were just the same. Chief Chen responded to the emergency and allocated 15 million Taiwan dollars, but this was too meager. However, due to the typhoon's attack, it gave a wonderful opportunity for human testing. North-south traffic was restored within 24 hours. The power grid was broken and the substation was broken, but all the lights were turned on in two days. Telephones and telegrams were restored to normal in nine ways. Only the man-made rice price (rising from 13 yuan to 17 yuan per catty) and the soaring price of building materials (tiles rising from four corners to 1.3 yuan) need to be unified and planned by various units.</p>
<p>After the typhoon, another special product fluctuated: two larger earthquakes occurred on the morning of the 28th from about four o'clock to seven thirty, but fortunately there was no damage. The island, nature gives it great hardship!</p>

<h3>On the Influence and Improvement of Overseas Chinese Commerce (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese residing abroad primarily engage in economic endeavors, with commerce being a major component of these activities. Speaking of commerce, it can be discussed on three levels: (1) Import and export businesses (head) traders (wholesalers), in which the number of Overseas Chinese is not large; (2) Urban secondary (intermediary) traders, in which a large number are run by Overseas Chinese; (3) Rural (tertiary) retail and small purchase traders, in which even more are operated by Overseas Chinese. The influence of Overseas Chinese commerce lies almost entirely in the areas of intermediary trading and retail small purchases. In a word, Overseas Chinese commerce almost entirely occupies the middleman position. This is because Europe, America, and Japan are industrial countries, while China is generally at most a country with fifty percent industry and fifty percent agriculture, and the Nanyang region is an agricultural society. European and American expatriates are only willing to use their capital to engage in upper-level large-scale import and export businesses in order to reap the greatest benefits, and are unwilling to do small businesses piecemeal, wasting time and effort, to pursue minuscule profits. Between Japanese expatriates and the local people, there is also a degree of estrangement. Although Japan was strong after World War I and presumptuously regarded itself as the savior of Southeast Asia, Japanese expatriates and the local people of Nanyang strove to cultivate good relations. Various places did indeed place hope in Japan, but after World War II, Japan completely exposed its deceptive face, and it became difficult for Japanese expatriates to restore their position after Japan's defeat. The knowledge and ability of the local people are also generally considered inferior to those of the Overseas Chinese. Therefore, in the trade between Europe, America, and post-war Japan with Nanyang, it is feared that they will still have to rely on Overseas Chinese as intermediaries. However, precisely because of this, Overseas Chinese commerce in the Nanyang region will inevitably face increased discrimination and competition from the local indigenous people in the future. The latter often have the misconception that Overseas Chinese are hindering their economic development. This can be seen from the recent situations in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>The relationship of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang commerce is an intermediary relationship, and with a large Overseas Chinese population and many hands, Overseas Chinese commerce flourishes and grows in this intermediary role. Professor MacNair of St. John's University in Shanghai stated in his book "The Status and Protection of Overseas Chinese": "The economic status of Overseas Chinese is extremely influential. Based on statistics compiled using Philippine tax revenues, Overseas Chinese control 90% of the retail trade in the Philippines, and they also dominate a large portion of the wholesale trade. European and American merchants can hardly trade with the local people without the intermediation of Overseas Chinese, and as a result, they have to seek assistance from Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese engaged in coconut, tobacco, rice, hemp, sugar, alcohol, copra, timber, and sundry goods businesses have often accumulated great wealth." How true these words are! Not only are Overseas Chinese in the Philippines like this, but Overseas Chinese in Siam, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies are all the same. However, how Overseas Chinese can maintain their position in the future is a matter for serious research. Here is a brief account of the commercial situation of Overseas Chinese in various Nanyang countries:</p>
<p>II. The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Various Nanyang Countries</p>
<p>(1) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in the Philippines</p>
<p>According to a comparative statistic report of the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce in 1932 on Overseas Chinese investment in economic enterprises during the most prosperous period and foreign investment, it is as follows: (Unit: Philippine Pesos in Thousands)</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the 1938 census statistics of the Philippine government, a comparison of Overseas Chinese and people of various countries engaged in retail businesses is as follows:</p>
<p>From the previous table, it can be seen that the number of retail operators and the amount of capital controlled by Overseas Chinese in the Philippines rank second only to the Philippine nationals, but the total income ranks first, accounting for 58%, Philippine nationals accounting for 38%, Japanese expatriates accounting for 2.65%, while the number of American, Spanish, and Indian expatriates engaged in retail businesses is small. A foreign writer, R. Hayden, said of the economic power of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, "Overseas Chinese in the Philippines account for 70% to 80% of the retail trade, and three-quarters of the commercial credit in the major islands is controlled by Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese supply 40% of the timber retail trade in the outer islands. The total amount of their investment is estimated at US$10 billion, which is equal to half of the US investment in China." Mr. Hayden's claim that Overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines reaches US$10 billion is inevitably an exaggeration, but it shows the great commercial power of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines.</p>
<p>(2) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Siam (Thailand)</p>
<p>In Bangkok, Siam, Guangdong (especially Chaozhou and Qiongzhou) expatriates outnumber Fujian expatriates, while in the interior, Minzhangquan expatriates outnumber Yuechaoqiong expatriates, totaling approximately three million people. The main occupation of Overseas Chinese in Siam is commerce, especially retail trade. Most peddlers often penetrate deep into remote mountains and valleys to trade with the local people. The transportation and milling of rice are mostly undertaken by Overseas Chinese. The industries and family handicrafts they operate include machinery, rice milling, sawmills, shipbuilding, textiles, electrical appliances, oil extraction, matches, tobacco, chemical industry, clothing, carpentry, leather, blacksmithing, tinwork, and mining, as well as rubber plantations and miners, and gardeners are also numerous. Siam's exports are mainly rice, teak, tin, and rubber, which are no different from Siam's four treasures, and rice occupies the most important position. Siam cultivates enough food for two years in one year, exporting 25 to 30 million piculs annually, accounting for 70% of the total export value, worth 95 to 100 million baht. In the Buddhist year 2482 (1939), it exported 31.25 million piculs (1,825,027 tons). In the first ten months of 1940, it exported 1,596,973 tons, worth 114,350,000 baht. Tin ranks second among the main products, with an annual output of 160,000 to 260,000 piculs, worth 17 to 30 million baht. In 1938, exports reached 34,030,000 baht. Before the war, the average price per ton in London was £237, which increased to £243 per ton in 1940, so the total value of tin exports from Siam in the first seven months of that year reached 26,030,000 baht. Rubber has only been around for two or thirty years, mostly planted in the south. At the end of 1939, Siam had 85 large rubber plantations, totaling 30,000 rai (Siamese acres). In addition, there are many small rubber plantations, totaling 312,000 rai. In 1938, it produced more than 40,000 tons, with a total export value of 35,120,000 baht. The annual export value of teak is 10 million baht.</p>
<p>According to a 1930 survey, there were 141 Overseas Chinese rice merchants, 84 import and export merchants, 10 insurance companies, 20 timber merchants, 21 machinery merchants, 18 furniture merchants, and 1,335 sundry goods merchants, which can be called extremely prosperous. However, since the Siamese coup in 1932, the so-called new economic policy has been implemented, especially since the military government sang the praises of "nationalism" in 1939, implementing anti-Chinese policies and successively promulgating more than 20 kinds of harsh anti-Chinese regulations, such as Chinese stores must employ 75% Siamese employees, tricycle and barber occupations are limited to Siamese people, and general retailers are gradually operated by Siamese people, etc. At that time, the Siamese government also listened to the plan of Japanese advisor Shinzo Mihara and issued cooperative business bonds in 1940, raising 18 million baht to promote various cooperative businesses, reaching a total of 2,639 units in the first half of 1941. In 1943, the Siamese government established the Ministry of Industry, and all existing industries such as papermaking, cement, brewing, tobacco, matches, sugar, and leather have been expanded. At the same time, chemical drugs, which were previously lacking, have also successively established experimental stations and factories. The entire commerce and economy of Overseas Chinese in Siam gradually entered a period of misfortune. Siam was coerced by Japan in 1942 to declare war on the Allied forces. However, since the official surrender ceremony of the Japanese army in Siam was held on January 11, 1946, Siamese nationalism has also been abolished. On the 23rd of the same month, after the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty, the Siamese Prime Minister met with Central News Agency reporters on February 7 and said: "The people of the two countries are so similar that they are almost indistinguishable. If you ask any Siamese person on the street, he will surely tell you that his grandfather or great-grandfather was Chinese. How can he feel aversion to his cousins, the Overseas Chinese? Like the United States and other countries, it is easy to delineate Overseas Chinese districts, but the Overseas Chinese in Siam can live anywhere and associate freely with the Siamese people. I believe that the commercial relations between the two countries will be greatly strengthened, because Overseas Chinese merchants account for 80% of all Siamese merchants." Professor MacNair said: "All those who have observed life in Siam know that the prosperity of Siam today is due to the contribution of the Chinese. It is generally acknowledged that the Chinese have injected their wisdom and blood into the Siamese nation, and then the Siamese people have become energetic." It is sincerely hoped that the Siamese nation, which contains Chinese blood, will renew its friendship with the Overseas Chinese, who are known for their diligence, thrift, hard work, law-abidingness, so that they will have the opportunity to develop commerce in Siam, which will also promote the economic trade between China and Siam.</p>
<p>(3) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Vietnam</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese in Vietnam originate from Guangdong, Fujian, Chaozhou, Hakka, Guangzhou, and Yunnan, Guangxi, etc., numbering approximately 400,000 people. Among them, those residing in Cochinchina account for 52%, Cambodia accounts for 33%, Tonkin accounts for 11%, Annam accounts for 3%, and Laos accounts for 1%. The Overseas Chinese who initially arrived in Vietnam were mostly without material possessions, relying only on their commercial talent and frugality to accumulate small capital, engage in peddling, and gradually become large merchants. From the 17th century onwards, Overseas Chinese have controlled the entire commerce of Vietnam. Vietnam uses raw materials to exchange for manufactured goods in the international market. Its products include rice, rubber, fish, livestock, hides, coal, zinc, tin, iron, iron alum, manganese, tungsten, and phosphates. Imports include cotton, silk, hardware, kerosene, and automobiles. Although Vietnam produces cotton, it is not self-sufficient, importing 95% annually, worth 249 million francs. According to the exchange rate of 1 piastre to 2 gold francs in 1933, it is 498 million francs per year (before 1932, each piastre was equal to 2 francs and 32 centimes). According to the statistics of 1935: In Vietnam's exports, food products accounted for 72.1%, and raw materials accounted for 24.9%; in imports, finished products accounted for 65.8%, and raw materials accounted for 34.2%. This is its economic feature.</p>
<p>France's influence entered Vietnam, taking the Saigon Treaty of 1862, which formally occupied Cochinchina, as a turning point, and in 1885, it controlled Cochinchina, Cambodia, Tonkin, Annam, Laos, and all of Annam, and in 1891, it formed a federation, completely completing its rule. Before and after France completely ruled Vietnam, all interactions between France and the local people mainly relied on Overseas Chinese as assistants. The Vietnamese retained the exclusionary ideology of the five dynasties and avoided contact with Westerners. Therefore, France on the one hand granted Overseas Chinese the right to undertake the collection of indirect taxes. The sale and taxation of salt, alcohol, and opium were all handled by Overseas Chinese. Later, because this right was so profitable, it was taken over by the French administrative office for sale, but due to the opposition of Overseas Chinese, the French side made concessions, nominally managed by officials, but the real power was still in the hands of Overseas Chinese. On the other hand, the French President ordered in 1897 to divide Asians (in fact, almost all Overseas Chinese) into six classes, paying an annual head tax or personal tax (Impot persoanl) ranging from a minimum of 10 piastres to 400 piastres. Vietnamese people only paid 2 piastres, while European and American expatriates were exempt, which was an unfair and harsh tax.</p>
<p>In general commerce, the French used Overseas Chinese as intermediaries for their transactions with the local people, thus forming a comprador (broker) profession for Overseas Chinese. The most influential ones were bank compradores. French banks could not lend money without the signature of an Overseas Chinese comprador. In addition, there were trade compradores; import compradores provided foreign goods to the local people, and export compradores purchased local goods from local producers for export, taking a commission in the process.</p>
<p>The economy of Vietnam can be said to be completely in the hands of Overseas Chinese: the largest of these is the rice milling industry, including millet, chili peppers, mountain goods, and other miscellaneous grains and their transactions. Rice milling factories and their export industries are mostly concentrated in Cholon City, near Saigon. According to a 1932 survey, Chinese people opened 75 rice milling factories, while French people opened only 3. Rice millers are engaged in the sale and export of white rice. Rice merchants and exporters rarely buy rough rice themselves, because there are many merchants who specialize in rough rice. This item is also monopolized by Overseas Chinese. The second is the cotton industry, where Overseas Chinese also hold almost the same position as in the rice industry, but due to the strong French capital and competition, since 1930, the cotton industry has been seized by French capital. The third is sugar. Overseas Chinese also occupy a monopoly position in sugar production. All purchases and loans of sugarcane, as well as the operation of sugar factories, are concentrated in the hands of Overseas Chinese. The center of the sugar industry is in Chaudoc, where Overseas Chinese operate more than 20 factories. Overseas Chinese operate four-fifths of the other sugar factories in Vietnam. Other businesses such as rubber, building materials, shipping, transportation, foreign goods, market industry (slaughtering meat, vegetables), spices, tea, silk, and rattan goods are also all in the hands of Overseas Chinese. In addition, there are many retail merchants and merchants. Outside of commerce, the power of Overseas Chinese in other enterprises is weak. In the mining industry, although Overseas Chinese were the pioneers, the French seized it because the development was too large, and the power of Overseas Chinese is very weak.</p>
<p>Businesses now in the hands of the French include: (1) electricity, (2) shipbuilding yards, (3) large factories, (4) trams, (5) automobiles, (6) brewing, (7) opium. In addition, the financial capital, the economic lifeline of Overseas Chinese, is required by the French government to be deposited in the Bank of France, so the entire economic lifeline of Overseas Chinese is completely under French control.</p>
<p>On September 22, 1940, the Japanese army entered Vietnam without a fight. Under the direction of the French-Vietnamese Governor-General, the Overseas Chinese economic organizations—grain and rice, consignment and storage industry, bread, alcohol affairs, slaughter industry, vegetable merchants, shipbuilding, grain milling, grain milling Chinese workers, tailoring, dressmaking, Western clothing, silk industry workers, women's sewing, hat-making commerce, embroidery, women's cotton weaving, lumberyards, bricks and tiles, stoves, glass, glass jars, wooden furniture, used furniture, rattanware, bamboo ware, candles and soap, pengguan merchants, machinery union, iron merchants, industry, shoemaking, carriages, printing merchants, printing, lithography, foreign goods merchants, barbering, women's virtue, women's reading, photography, music, and other 56 units, guilds, trade unions, and other social groups were all closed and disbanded. All movable and immovable property of all Overseas Chinese organizations was also completely confiscated and auctioned off. The proceeds were allocated to charitable organizations in the localities where the groups were located as charitable donations. The economic losses of the Overseas Chinese were very large. Japan surrendered, the Allied forces won, and the land of Vietnam was restored. Especially since the signing of the Sino-French Equality Treaty on February 28 of this year, Vietnam should improve the economic activities of Overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>To Whom Do We Complain? The Blood and Tears of "Golden Rugao"</h3>
<p>— Our Zhenjiang, September 18th Dispatch by Wang Han'ou</p>
<p>In northern Jiangsu, "Golden Rugao," what a magnificent and seductive term this is. But this place has been suffering from disasters since the Anti-Japanese War, and has been kneaded into something worse than scrap metal.</p>
<p>As early as the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, the Japanese invaders landed on the riverbank in Nantong and rushed towards Rugao and Dongtai. When in Nantong, the cruelty of the enemy was not so severe, but after passing Nantong, the situation changed. Burning, killing, raping, and looting were carried out without any scruples. Therefore, the people of Rugao endured the most unbearable period.</p>
<p>A Series of Oppressive Policies</p>
<p>The whole city was filled with wailing ghosts and howling dogs, and there was no peace. After a few months, in order to transfer troops and shorten the defense line, the Japanese devils withdrew from Dongtai and Yancheng, but they did not give up Rugao alone. Because the Japanese ronin and pro-Japanese traitors, they all believed that "Golden Rugao" still had blood and marrow to suck, so they insisted on not letting go and continued to exploit it. Then, the guerrillas counterattacked the city, and the Japanese devils burned civilian houses at the four city gates, making many people homeless. When the Wang Jingwei "government" was established, the political line was completely focused on kidnapping the god of wealth and extorting money, and they suffered more than seven years of occupation crimes. The people of Rugao paid their blood and flesh little by little in the midst of humiliation and endurance. After finally waiting for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the hope of peace, another set of "Liberation War" cannons came, and countless innocent people inside and outside the city were sacrificed. After the place was "liberated," the people of Rugao longed for the restoration of their normal lives in the future; but the facts disappointed them. The "Liberation Zone government" not only did not grant them democracy and freedom, but also brought "revolution," struggle, and reckoning, a series of oppressive policies that were frantically launched like wildfire. As a result, the propertied class declined, the propertyless class became unemployed, and all industry and commerce became "publicly owned." Those who could still steal a bowl of humiliating food in the past could not even do that now. The unfortunate people of Rugao began to need to complain, but to whom do they complain?</p>
<p>Struggling on the Edge of Death</p>
<p>The people of Rugao suffered such great pain that they were said to have transformed their lives and been reborn until the government recovered Rugao. But they still could not escape the threat of war. Around it, there were several earth-shattering battles in Dingnian, Yanghuaqiao, and Fenjie, which were all launched by the Communist army in the so-called "strategic situation." In Guitou Street and Xie San Guan Ting in Dingnian, such eerie places, the Communist army launched a siege of tens of thousands of people, and once announced the capture of Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Division of the National Army. However, as a result, Commander Wang was not captured, but it itself suffered tens of thousands of casualties. Those dead bodies lay in the fields and ditches, gradually rotting and stinking. Wherever you went, you could still faintly smell the stench of decaying corpses. After six days and seven nights of bloody battles in Yanghuaqiao and Songjiazhuang, there was not a single intact house, nor a complete field of crops. All the residents' possessions were destroyed. Everyone died or fled. Even now, there are still many people who have not dared to run back to take a look at their destroyed homes. In Fenjie, the shells from both sides poured down like taro and radishes. It is pitiful that those "rush! rush!" "militia" and "armed work teams" were buried here confusedly.</p>
<p>The Ancient City Has Lost Its Luster.</p>
<p>The National Army entered the city, and the war came to an end. Everyone hoped that traffic would gradually resume and commercial activities would slowly recover; however, the Communist army, scattered in the four suburbs, began to move again after being reorganized and supplemented, and they also received reinforcements from the north. They chose the weakest stronghold on the highway - Dingnian, Baipu, and counterattacked. This time, the regular troops and traffic police of the National Army gave them a strong blow, and successively annihilated nearly 10,000 people, but the traffic in Dingnian was finally cut off temporarily, and Rugao City became a situation of being surrounded on three sides. Here we should thank the ancient city of Rugao. This old-century building has miraculously protected the safety of the residents in the city. During the day, the Communist army, fearing aerial reconnaissance, hid in the sorghum fields and dared not move. At night, "rush! rush!" they could not climb up the city. This ancient city hugged the people in the city like a nanny. The calmness and determination of the troops stationed in the city left the Communist army with no other choice but to tightly surround and blockade the city, restricting the entry of rice and grass. It is pitiful that the people in the city cannot even eat a little vegetable at the moment. Many poor people simply rely on the relief flour that entered the city in the first batch last time to survive. Observing the recent situation, the Communist army's planned counterattacks on several towns have not been successful, and Rugao City is certainly out of the question. However, the relief of Rugao will probably still take some time, because there are too many early-grain fields in that area, which are very conducive to the Communist army's hiding. When the sorghum and corn are harvested, and the National Army's reinforcements have cleared the highway, the Communist army will have no way to hide and move in the nearby countryside, and their counterattack will completely collapse.</p>

<h3>"Open Killing" Case in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Yangzhou Dispatch, September 16th, by our special correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>The sensational Li Wen assassination case, covered as a "headline news" special edition in various newspapers, is significant. But shouldn't the "open killing" of thousands upon thousands of ordinary people's lives also be considered news?</p>
<p>Let's start with the situation before January:</p>
<p>"Jiangdu, 29th Dispatch: Communist troops near the Goddess Temple in Yangzhou launched a small-scale harassment today, possibly a prelude to a large-scale offensive. Also, in the southwest area of Shaobo Lake, Communist troops have been active recently. According to refugees who escaped from Shaobo, Qiaomo, and other places, Communist troops are carrying out large-scale massacres in these areas. Those deemed 'pro-government' people, including women and children, are not spared. In Liujiazhuang alone, the number reached over three hundred. The methods of killing are appalling. One person, after being arrested, was thrown into a dung pit, submerged for half an hour, then pulled out and forced to wear cotton clothes under the blazing sun. This was repeated, and the victim screamed until he died. The Communist troops took pleasure in this."</p>
<p>Naked Escape</p>
<p>This is the second such incident this month. The first was between the 13th and 15th, when Communist troops from Shaobo and Gaoyou launched attacks and disturbances in the Huxi (west of Gaoyou Lake) area. The people in Songjia Bridge and Lingtang Bridge in the seventh district of Gaoyou County, as well as Gongdao Bridge in the eighth district of Jiangdu County, suffered even more severely at the hands of the Communist troops. At the time, people who escaped from these areas to Yangzhou recounted, "The entire town of Gongdao Bridge originally had over two hundred households, with a population of about one thousand people, counting five people per household. After two days of massacre and widespread escape, truly not a chicken or dog remained. Even elderly people over sixty, who had never left their hometown for many years (including during the Japanese occupation), were forced to flee this time. As a result, summing up several places, about five thousand people fled their hometowns to Yangzhou (a previous newspaper reported fifty thousand, which was a mistake). In Lianxing Temple in the northern suburbs of Yangzhou alone, over six hundred people were taken in. Most of them were shirtless, and their accounts completely convinced me of the truth. Most of them escaped at night, and in their haste to flee, they didn't even have time to put on a jacket. There were even some who reportedly escaped completely naked because, habitually, in the hot nights, they often slept without trousers."</p>
<p>Slashing, Beheading, Exposure and Drowning</p>
<p>In one family, ten out of eleven members were brutally murdered by the Communist troops. The one who survived escaped over the back wall. The methods of the atrocities included tying up several children and throwing them into the river to die. There were also three other different methods. One was "exposure to the sun" as mentioned in the earlier telegram. The others were "waist chop" and "neck cut."</p>
<p>What is "waist chop"? It is using an old-fashioned large guillotine-like "cutting frame" to cut a person in half at the waist.</p>
<p>What is "neck cut"? "Neck cut" is using an ordinary kitchen knife to cut the person's neck as if cutting a rope.</p>
<p>People in Yangzhou will tell you the same if you ask them. Great thinkers, great scientists, and great religious figures of the world all say, "Human beings have innate great desires, the first of which is health and the preservation of life…" So how can people not care about and be aware of such unfortunate events that might befall them?</p>
<p>A Cry from the Heart</p>
<p>Without asking what crime the people committed by being "pro-government," I feel before ending this dispatch: For the precarious lives of the people of Northern Jiangsu, for the meaning of all human lives, I must make a desperate cry for survival. At the same time, I want to lodge a complaint against the current laws of the country—the tragic killing of one or two people is a "criminal case," and the perpetrator is guilty of "murder." But when the lives of hundreds and thousands of people are openly killed simultaneously, where is our law? The lives of "important people" should be valued more, but are the lives of ordinary people not lives in the eyes of the law, in the innate right to survive?</p>
<p>Please do not think that my cry is too high-pitched, nor that this is an unnecessary subjective opinion from a news reporter. This is the cry from the bottom of the hearts of every good person in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to invite everyone to practice a song. It was the most popular song during the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, "Defend Dawu Dam": "Arise, compatriots! They killed our parents! They killed our brothers! Arise, compatriots! They killed our sisters! They killed our wives and children! Arise, compatriots!…" After reviewing this song, what is churning in your mind? As a news reporter, oh, I can't bear to say it anymore!</p>
<h3>Looking North to Home, Where Flames of War Rage and Floods Surge - Northern Jiangsu Refugees Sit or Lie on Coffins - Separated from the Dead by Only One Wall</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th, Wang Han'ou</p>
<p>"Autumn wind, autumn rain, sadden one to death." At this time, in this scene, probably only the displaced refugees of Northern Jiangsu can intimately experience this. Their homes have been destroyed, people are displaced outside, in the bleak autumn wind, looking north to their hometowns, where flames of war rage and floods surge... Countless sorrows gather in their hearts, they never thought, after one year of national rejoicing and celebrating the victory of restoration, they are still enduring the suffering of displacement!</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, the displaced refugees huddled in shelters and wandering in the streets are particularly numerous compared to other cities in the Jiangnan region. Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province and also a transportation hub connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. The refugees come to Zhenjiang as soon as they arrive; Zhenjiang is their natural nanny. Here, they not only escape the terror of "struggle" but also receive warmth and relief. In this way, Zhenjiang accommodates thousands of refugees, and there are dozens of shelters, reception centers, county-level relief associations, and relief stations inside and outside the city. Under the auspices of the provincial government authorities and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, they have rescued a large number of refugees who have fled from Northern Jiangsu. The reporter went to visit a shelter. This is a mountain villa belonging to a certain provincial guildhall. Many coffins of fellow provincials are floating in the dim room, coffins of dead people. Next to the coffins, however, are rows of bedding for the refugees, with many men, women, old and young sitting and lying down.</p>
<p>Some are families of several, others are just single men. Their haggard faces are etched with traces of their suffering. They have been fleeing for several months, and everything they owned has been eaten into their stomachs. Now, they almost all rely on relief flour, using it to make gruel every day to solve their hunger. Although they are so distressed, they still endure peacefully. Each of them has an endless tale of suffering. As soon as you ask him or her, they will immediately pour out their hearts to you. The first thing they say is "How terrible!" "How terrible!" Then they tell many shocking and cruel stories. Finally, they point to the coffin and say to the reporter: "Sir, you see, now we live in this pitiful place, separated from the dead by a wall, but we don't feel afraid. Thinking about being at home, it was really separated from the dead by a wall, with the danger of losing our lives at any time!"</p>
<p>The composition of these refugees is mostly from the middle class and literate intellectuals. From their arduous and serious exile, it can be seen that they have not lost the hardworking nature of the people of Northern Jiangsu. They help to build roads, dig mud and carry stones in the mountains, chop firewood for farmers, doing all kinds of hard labor, taking the lowest meager wages—the lowest wage is only five or six hundred yuan per day. Recently, several sections of roads in Zhenjiang have been completed with the help of refugees. Every day they run to the relief station to look at the announcements: "A certain agency is recruiting one hundred stokers," "A certain station is recruiting eighty road workers," This is the little work they might get and a little hope to improve their living standards.</p>
<p>In the newspaper district of Zhongshan Road in the city, seven or eight local newspapers are posted on the wall. This is where refugees gather every morning. From seven o'clock to ten o'clock, the area is crowded with people. They are looking for news from their hometowns, watching and talking about the war situation. As they watch, they see hope. A large area of Huaiyin and Huainan has been recovered by the National Army, and they have the opportunity to be protected and return to their hometowns. Then they look at the news from the hometown associations. Dozens of relief association announcements from Huaian, Huaiyin, Suining, Siyang, are posted on the wall, telling them where to register, providing travel expenses to send them back home. "Where is your registration office?" "Shall we go together?" Everyone talks and says, full of energy. But there are still some places in Northern Jiangsu that have not been recovered by the National Army. Although there are also announcements from the relief associations of various counties, also calling them to go to the office to register and prepare for the return home procedures, those refugees say with worry: "Will there be a solution soon? The Communists are trying to delay again." The autumn wind is rising, and the facilities in the refugee shelters are somewhat incapable of shielding them from the wind and rain, and warm clothing has become a problem. Looking longingly at the bountiful autumn harvest in Northern Jiangsu, they are really looking forward to returning home!</p>
<h3>The Labor Movement in Japan</h3>
<p>— Tokyo Special Dispatch, 2nd, by our special correspondent Chuan Junyi</p>
<p>The development process of the labor movement in Japan after the war can be divided into three periods: The first period was from the Japanese surrender to the end of last year. During this period, the Dai Nippon Sangyo Hokokukai (Greater Japan Industrial Patriotic Association), a tool of the Japanese military, was dissolved. The leaders of the Labor Union General Federation led by Komakichi Matsuoka of the Socialist Party, and the National Council of Trade Unions, held an expanded preparatory meeting of the central labor organizations on January 3, deciding to temporarily focus on the formation of various trade union units. The Communist Party also held a national party congress on November 8 last year, at which it was decided to adopt a common struggle policy with the Socialist Party's Labor Union General Federation, and at the same time independently organize various associations. Thus, under the leadership of these two factions, Japan's labor movement unfolded organized activities. The characteristic of this period was that the various trade unions had no organizational ties, and the demands were mostly economic, such as increasing wages and recognizing trade unions.</p>
<p>The second period was from last year to February of this year. During this period, the preparatory committee of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, led by the Communist Party, established various trade unions at the end of February. These unions were horizontally combined based on regional and capital system distinctions. The main demands were to require employers to sign collective bargaining agreements and participate in production and management.</p>
<p>The third period is from February of this year to the present. The characteristic of this period is that the form of struggle has gradually changed from the economic sphere to the political sphere, mainly to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. At the same time, because the government stopped the wartime subsidy policy, and because a large number of factories have been designated as reparations items, resulting in reduced productivity, a large number of unemployed reserve army will be generated. Therefore, the current goal of the struggle is to require that all employed workers must be employed.</p>
<p>Rising and Falling of Labor Strikes</p>
<p>In terms of the ups and downs of labor strikes, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare: labor strikes in February and March were between 100 and 130, while in April and May they increased to between 150 and 165. From the Japanese surrender to the end of May, a total of 1,130 labor strikes occurred, involving 918,000 workers. After June, labor strikes gradually decreased, totaling 155, and decreased again to 101 in July. The main reason was the distribution of a large amount of food rations by MacArthur. However, there has been a gradual increase in the trend recently. Although the recent labor strikes of the National Railway Workers and Seamen have been resolved, opinions within the trade unions have not yet been unified, and at the same time, the newspaper workers are also brewing a strike. Furthermore, in terms of the industrial sectors where labor strikes occur, in the first five months of this year, among the 663 labor strikes, the machinery and tool industry accounted for 174, about 25% or more, coal mines accounted for 98, accounting for 14% or more, transportation accounted for 96, the metal industry accounted for 46, and sawmills accounted for 42. Labor strikes are mostly concentrated in these industries because the working-class consciousness in these industries is stronger. Furthermore, in terms of region, Tokyo and Hokkaido have the most labor strikes, while Osaka and Fukuoka, which are industrial centers, have fewer.</p>
<p>Two Major Factions</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the labor movement in Japan is now led by two major factions. One is the Labor Union General Federation led by the Socialist Party, and the other is the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions led by the Communist Party. The former has 800,000 members, and the latter has 1.3 million members. Laborers participating in trade union organizations total 3 million, and the members participating in these two organizations total 2.1 million. The other 900,000 people take a neutral attitude. The chairman of the General Federation is Komakichi Matsuoka, who served as a councilor of the National Spiritual Mobilization Headquarters and a special commissioner for military protection during the war. Some people compare him to William Green of the United States, while they compare Katsumi Kikutami, the chairman of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, to Philip Murray. The character of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions is to deny capitalism and advocate that workers in various industries take unified action, using common struggle methods to advance from economic struggle to political struggle. The General Federation's policy is based on economic struggle as a principle. In this National Railway Workers' strike, the attitude of the Socialist Party was very clear, not supporting the workers in carrying out strikes, fearing that the strike would turn into a political struggle. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Suehiro Nishio, declared at the Second Party Congress on the 28th: He regards the General Federation's strike as a weapon and advocates that all party policies should be realized through Parliament. At the same time, at the inaugural meeting of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions on August 19, it was decided that trade unions should be guaranteed the freedom to support political parties, and to unify the labor front from the bottom up through common struggle, in other words, to accept the leadership of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Employer Offensive</p>
<p>Due to these significant differences in political views, there is no hope of unification. With the surge of the labor movement, the employer's offensive has gradually strengthened. The Labor Relations Adjustment Act recently passed in Parliament can be said to be the first step in the employer's offensive against labor. The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other minority parties strongly opposed it in Parliament, but because the Liberal and Progressive parties approved it, it was finally passed by Parliament. This regulation stipulates that employees of public utility enterprises may not strike arbitrarily, and at the same time stipulates that strikes may not be carried out for less than 30 days during the mediation period. Government officials and civil servants are also not allowed to strike. At the same time, the Economic Stabilization Board believes that the current labor-management disputes are mostly political in nature and may develop into a movement to overthrow the cabinet. It advocates the establishment of a Labor-Management Consultation Council, inviting labor, management, and third parties to participate. Powerful employer groups, such as the Economic Doyukai (Committee for Economic Development), have recently issued statements on the current labor-management disputes, advocating labor-management coordination to achieve corporate rationalization, opposing the government's massive layoffs, and implementing the rationalization of enterprises. However, workers should not arbitrarily oppose layoffs, and should implement the rationalization of production and management through a management consultation council organized by labor and management. This association is composed of important figures from the Kansai financial community and is a political economic organization. It goes without saying that the statement on labor-management issues issued by the association represents the powerful opinions of the employers. Recently, Shinji Iwamoto, Director of the Research Bureau of the Bank of Japan, told a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun: From now on, Japanese enterprises should be managed with the participation of both labor and management, so he believes that the establishment of an economic consultation council is necessary, but the direct participation of workers in planning has the potential to be politically exploited.</p>
<p>Trade Union Policy</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of the current Japanese labor organization is the weakness of organizational leadership. For example, during the food demonstration on May 20, the Tokyo branch of the National Railway Workers' Union actually ordered each branch to force free rides to participate in the parade, which was prohibited by the Eighth Army authorities. Kazuo Okochi, a professor of social policy at Tokyo University and an expert in social policy, said in his booklet "Social Policy After the War": Since the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese working class has lacked autonomy in spirit.</p>
<p>The capitalist's self-profit-seeking position has limits. Therefore, engineers, management leaders, workers, and representatives of all levels related to management should jointly participate in management, abandoning the capitalist profit-seeking management model and adopting a productivity-centered overall management model. This is the socialization of management and can also be said to be the democratization of management. However, the Japanese Trade Union Law only focuses on the first task. Japanese trade unions should realize these two tasks in one fell swoop. More unfortunately, the Japanese working class is not yet mature in the training to implement these two tasks. This is the tragedy of the Japanese trade union movement.</p>

<h3>The Future of Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Yan Haoying</p>
<p>The women's movement has been around for a long time, but it's only in the thirty or forty years since the beginning of the twentieth century that it has shown its true power. In the past, women's movements were too fragmented and unorganized, merely individual activities of a few intellectual women rather than a collective movement of women as a whole. Their policies often leaned towards local improvements while neglecting fundamental solutions. It is only now that the women's movement is progressing in an organized manner, and the solution lies in a glorious future.</p>
<p>An important trend in the women's movement is the shift from seeking happiness for a few women to seeking happiness for all women, and from the leadership of activities by a few intellectual women to the participation of all oppressed women in the struggle.</p>
<p>Secondly, the focus of its development will be on economic liberation. This is because, from the perspective of social evolution, the economic system has a very important impact on human life. All the oppression suffered by women is entirely caused by the economic system of male patriarchal society. Women's sexual and political subordination are merely the results of economic subordination. Therefore, the key to women achieving sexual and political liberation still lies in economic liberation.</p>
<p>Opening the doors of social occupations to allow women to participate cannot be seen as evidence that women have achieved economic liberation. It is only a step towards achieving economic liberation. Economic oppression exists in society just as it does in the family. Women lacking training in skills and eager to obtain work become objects of oppression. Just as when women enter the workforce, they often take on tedious and even sordid jobs that are poorly paid and take up a lot of time. They can hardly support themselves with their wages, and the heavy workload wears down their physical health.</p>
<p>Although the entry of modern women into the workforce is partly due to the advocacy and promotion of women's movement activists, it is mostly driven by the general trend of the Industrial Revolution. At this time, scientific inventions have not yet fully reformed the family. Women rush into society in the urgent tide of life, are incorporated into the organization of production, and the responsibilities of the family still bind their hands and feet, not allowing them a moment of rest. After gaining formal liberation, women simultaneously shoulder the responsibilities of household management, social production, and even racial reproduction. This excessive labor is not adequately compensated, and it reveals to current women's movement activists that the transformation of family organization cannot be ignored while developing women's careers. The liberation of women should take all aspects into account: if women leave the family to serve society, then household chores must be simplified; if women invest in social production organizations, then treatment and compensation must be improved to avoid becoming a new form of oppression for women; and although women seek economic independence from social occupational life, they still bear the responsibility for the survival of the race, so society should do what it can to develop their maternal instincts in good conditions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can conclude that the future development of the women's movement must pay attention to the following three things:</p>
<p>First, national protection. The main method of national protection is to formulate women's labor laws. Currently, many countries have paid attention to this issue due to the urging of women's movement activists. Although it remains to be seen whether this new legislation will bring real benefits to women, depending on the sincerity of employers, there is hope for future development. Currently, many countries are focusing on the following when formulating women's labor laws: abolishing night work, reducing working hours; increasing compensation, stipulating minimum wages; prohibiting the employment of women in heavy and dangerous work; protecting maternity, stipulating that pregnant women have several weeks of leave before and after childbirth, with wages paid as usual, or without wages but with a maternity allowance, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, the socialization of housework. To prevent household chores from becoming an obstacle to women's social development, they should be taken out of women's hands and entrusted to society for management. This is a very interesting attempt, and the progress of science will make this attempt a kind of progress that many modern people dare not imagine. Apart from the Soviet Union and the United States, many countries have not yet dared to try the socialization of housework. However, according to the current trend, women will eventually break away from the "realm of the family" and become a member of society. The Soviet Union has transferred all the duties of the family to the state in the rapid changes of society, making it a public matter. In the United States, due to the development of social undertakings, household chores have gradually been taken over by a part of society and become a commercial organization. Although the methods of these two are different, they show a common point, that is, general housework is handled by society instead of the former housewives. In the future, what will adorn the new construction of society will be public lodgings, public laundries, public dining rooms, public entertainment rooms or entertainment venues, etc.; only then will women be completely free people, and in addition to working for society like men, they will no longer have to be managers of men's household chores.</p>
<p>Third, public childcare. The education of children is also a kind of housework. I am separating it out here only to show its importance. The most important duty of women in the family is childcare. When the women's occupational liberation movement began, men's insistence on opposition was based on this reason. However, since the progress of scientific knowledge such as educational psychology, it is known that public childcare institutions specially set up by society to replace maternal management and education of children are not only beneficial in terms of hygiene and health, but also have great social value in terms of children's psychological concepts. This coincides with the demands of women's liberation. The popularity of modern kindergartens and nurseries has opened up the beginning of the public childcare movement. When the public childcare system is realized, the social liberation of women will be almost completely unproblematic.</p>
<p>In short, we can assert that when the women's problem is solved, it will be the time when inequality and oppression are eliminated in mankind. At that time, the world unfolding before us will have complete freedom and equality.</p>
<h3>American Women Bring Children to Attend Election Meetings</h3>
<h3>Children's Teeth</h3>
<p>— Guo Chang</p>
<p>If there were two children standing in front of you, the first child's teeth are neat and white, and the second child's teeth are very uneven, yellow, and have bad breath, which one would you like? Of course, from the appearance, the second child will undoubtedly leave you with a bad impression.</p>
<p>The neatness and health of teeth are really based on the attention and protection of parents during childhood. If parents do not pay attention during childhood, then their future teeth arrangement must be messy and prone to decay, which will cause lifelong regrets for their children.</p>
<p>Teeth are part of the bone tissue of the human body. Generally speaking, its exterior is surrounded by hard enamel, and inside the enamel is softer dentin. The center of the tooth is nerves and blood vessels. If bacteria invade the teeth, they are very easy to decay. Therefore, wise parents should take care of their children's teeth when they are young. Fathers often do not have time to take care of their children because they are busy with work outside, so mothers should take up this responsibility. The following are several rules for protecting teeth, hoping to earnestly teach children to do them:</p>
<p>(1) Cultivate good habits for children to brush their teeth early in the morning and before going to bed, because if they do not brush their teeth, the decaying food in the crevices of their teeth will easily breed bacteria, which will decay their teeth, hinder digestion, and eventually lead to gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<p>(2) During childhood, permanent teeth are just forming, so do not let them bite hard fruits and excessively hot or cold food, so as not to damage the enamel and dental nerves.</p>
<p>(3) Children love sweets the most, so make sure they eat less.</p>
<p>(4) Give them more food rich in calcium, such as peanuts, bamboo shoots, and grains. Because the majority of teeth are composed of calcium, if the human body lacks calcium, it will draw calcium from the teeth to supplement it, and the teeth will decay. Therefore, calcium should be supplemented frequently.</p>
<p>(5) If there is a sudden toothache that lasts for a few seconds and then stops, you should immediately consult a good dentist, because this is often a sign that the tooth is about to decay.</p>
<p>(6) If a tooth has decayed into a hole, do not remove it arbitrarily, because after random removal, the nearby teeth will often become loose and easily fall out. You should try to repair it as much as possible.</p>
<p>(7) When deciduous teeth fall out at the age of six or seven, you should consult a good dentist to avoid the messy arrangement of permanent teeth in the future.</p>
<p>(8) Rinse your mouth after eating.</p>
<p>(9) Do not put your fingers in your mouth, because there are many bacteria on your fingers, which not only easily decay your teeth, but also easily transmit other diseases.</p>
<p>The above nine points are simple and easy to implement. Just need parents to pay a little attention to their children, then the foundation of their children's lifelong happiness, beauty, and health can be laid from a young age.</p>
<h3>The Use of Eggs in Cosmetology</h3>
<p>— Yu Renfeng</p>
<p>We all know that eggs are a useful treasure because they contain a lot of protein, not only delicious, but also a necessary and large-scale need in industry and medicine. Now I want to mention its two uses in cosmetology, which cannot but be said to be its side effects.</p>
<p>First, we feel the importance of the "face" to life, especially for women. A middle-aged woman with several children has wrinkles on her face that are almost like an old woman. How can such a chicken-skin face be pleasing? This should be treated with this method: first put an egg (yolk and white) in a teacup, mix and stir it with brown sugar, wait for it to solidify, then slowly pour some water on it to make it smooth, and that's considered successful. (But you must carefully and slowly chop up the clotted brown sugar with force to avoid impurities mixing in it and scratching your skin.) Then, you treat it as soap for washing your face (or even simpler, just add a small amount of water without brown sugar). When washing your face or bathing, use your hands to scoop some into your palm and rub it evenly, from your face to your chest. At this time, you become an Abyssinian warrior, but don't laugh, because when you laugh, the muscles of your face will move, which is not good. So, if you are bathing at this time, please continue to wash, and just when you are finished washing, the medicine (so to speak) on your face may be about to dry. At this time, your face will feel tight, but don't panic. After it dries, slowly wash it off with warm water, and you will find how smooth and jade-like your face is!</p>
<p>Second, the egg shampoo method is the best way to protect and repair hair. If you can do it constantly, it will not only make your hair look extraordinarily shiny and beautiful, but also not easy to fall out. That is, the night before you prepare to shampoo, first wash your hair with water until it is clean and remove the dirt, then wash it again with pure and high-quality hair oil. After that, beat two eggs (both yolk and white) into a prepared basin, and use both hands to fully rub and wash from the scalp to the ends of the hair. At the scalp, comb with a comb or scratch with your fingertips; in the middle and ends of the hair, you can hold and rub it with both hands. If you can wash it four or five times, then wash it off with water. As long as you can do this, from youth to old age, the hair will not easily turn white, and even if it turns white, the hair will be very moist, giving people a sense of beauty. Women are prone to hair loss after childbirth. If you use this method, you can avoid it. These are all true experiences, so don't take it lightly.</p>

<h3>The Static Beauty Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianduo</p>
<p>On the road or in the park, we often see many newly married couples, hand in hand, heads bowed and necks close, talking sweet nothings. Indeed, newlywed life is the sweetest, but when we turn to look at the daily newspapers, the number of divorces is also constantly increasing. They fail to maintain the static beauty within the hearts of the husband and wife after marriage and taste the bitterness of love, so a Western proverb says: "Love can create comedy, and also create tragedy"; a French ballad says: "The joy of love vanishes in an instant, the pain of love lingers in the heart forever"; even now some people are singing: "Marriage is the tomb of love." These are all caused by not understanding how to pursue the supreme art of life and how to maximize the static beauty hidden deep within the heart.</p>
<p>The so-called inner beauty refers to the English Inner-Manner. Human beings have two kinds of distinctions: outer-manner (Oeet-Manner) and inner-manner (Inner-Manner). Outer-manner, such as physical satisfaction, material enjoyment, and the pursuit of fame and fortune, cannot outweigh the real needs of the inner soul. Static beauty is a kind of inner beauty. Suppose a husband comes home from work every day, feeling quite tired, at this time, he needs some light and quiet comfort to regulate and compensate for his boring and heavy work during the day, but the wife insists on not being aware of the situation, and insists on him accompanying her to buy clothing materials, or nagging about the child's tuition for the next semester, or the rising prices of firewood and rice. You think, how will he feel of disgust and displeasure at this time. I once saw a modern family, both husband and wife were highly educated and could quite understand the art of love. Whenever he finished work, dragging his tired body back to the door of the house, the wife did not say much to him, but gave him a slight smile. This smile was enough to invigorate his spirit and relieve most of his fatigue. Secondly, she then asked her children to bring slippers for their father, and she personally brewed a cup of hot coffee or milk and placed it beside his desk, helping him take off his clothes and hang them on the hanger. At dinner, she prepared his favorite dishes. After dinner, her husband would accompany her to listen to music, or go to the theater, or take a walk in the park; at this time, they could talk and love as much as possible, and if she had any requests, they could be fulfilled. This is really much better than the wife mentioned above.</p>
<p>In fact, true static beauty is distributed in every small action. If a husband can stroke and pay attention to his wife's hair when she is quiet, you will feel that every hair on her head is as precious as silk. If you look at her eyes again, you will find that they contain infinite deep affection. Your heart will be seduced and swayed by these, and when you see her cherry-red mouth again, I think you will not be able to help yourself, embrace her and give her a sweet kiss! In the morning, when your wife is dressing in front of the mirror, you can tie her bow tie for her, or put a fresh flower in her hair. Her heart will thank you for this and give you a smile. If a husband does not pay attention to these details, or forgets to give her a gift on her birthday, then his married life is like having a reef, and he will not receive any warmth from his wife, and there will be no happiness to speak of.</p>
<p>If a wife can pay attention to her husband's daily behavior and actions, or the moment he gets into the car when he goes to work, and his posture when talking, you will be proud of how handsome, generous, and energetic he is. When he accompanies you to a banquet or walks on the street, you will show a knowing smile and a proud expression on your face, because you have found a satisfactory husband.</p>
<p>Dear young men and women, whether you are married or not, whether love has encountered obstacles, I hope you can use your talents to maximize the static beauty of your hearts in order to obtain a happy marriage.</p>

<h3>The Thirty-Sixth Anniversary of the Death of the Famous American Writer Mark Twain</h3>
<p>— Yin Huaiyuan</p>
<p>The name Mark Twain, in China and in countries around the world, will not be unfamiliar. Mark Twain occupies the most glorious position in the short history of American literature. He is a novelist, essayist, and also a world-renowned master of humor.</p>
<p>The literary giant's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, and Mark Twain was his pen name. He was born in a small village in Missouri in 1835, but grew up in Hannibal Port on the Mississippi River. He had a natural, keen power of observation, and from a young age he silently memorized every mysterious thing in this frontier area, laying the foundation for several of his immortal masterpieces that he would write later.</p>
<p>The death of his father when he was twelve years old became a turning point in his life. His mother, under duress of poverty, could not continue to send him to school, so she sent him to a printing house to work as an apprentice. Mark Twain was fortunate enough to see newspapers from all over the country in the printing house, so his knowledge increased day by day. Sometimes he even wrote some essays for the Hannibal newspaper. At the age of seventeen, he wrote a humorous sketch and submitted it to a humorous weekly magazine in Boston, describing a young boatman who tried to intimidate a burly and powerful lumberjack, but was beaten and fell into the water. The meaning of the text was extremely humorous, and readers were all laughing.</p>
<p>Before he could create valuable works, Mark Twain constantly studied the various personalities and types of people. He worked in the printing house for nine years, which made him understand a lot of the humor and satirical literature that the public loved, and he also had many opportunities to write articles, but in 1857 he completely changed his profession, and went to a boat to learn how to steer. That year he was twenty-two years old. Seventeen months later, he had learned everything, so he was promoted to pilot.</p>
<p>During that period, the Mississippi River was a major transportation route in the country, and all kinds of people came and went in a constant stream every day. Mark Twain secretly studied their different personalities. His position gave him a lot of free time to talk to passengers. Whether on the boat or on the shore, he always liked to listen to guests tell strange stories from all over. He later used what he saw and heard on the Mississippi River as the subject matter and wrote a famous book "Life on the Mississippi". The book was published in 1882.</p>
<p>After he lived on the boat for four years, the Civil War broke out, and transportation on the Mississippi River was also interrupted. Mark Twain and his brother fled to Nevada. His brother later served as a clerk there, so he lived there for five years. After that, he went to work as a reporter for a newspaper and was sent to Washington to cover the news of the legislative discussions in Congress. The communications he wrote back were first published under the pen name Mark Twain, and from then on he was known to the world by the name Mark Twain, and his real name was not known. At the same time, he also continuously published many short stories in the newspaper, which made his name spread quickly in the Americas, and slowly spread to all over the world.</p>
<p>Mark Twain later left Washington and went to San Francisco, where he found a job as a reporter without much effort. In his work, he fully demonstrated his talent, and from then on his fame grew day by day. During this period, he published a short story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County", which was not only reprinted by newspapers all over the Americas, but also quickly reprinted or translated by European countries, and everyone enjoyed reading it. Mark Twain had traveled to Europe, but he did not worship European culture, but praised everything in the Americas everywhere. He once said: "European culture is not worthy of envy, American culture has its own future." It can be seen that he was a writer who loved his country and his homeland.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was a realist, and all his works were nurtured from his life experiences. "Roughing lt" makes people laugh and feel pity for his five years of life in Nevada after reading it. After "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" were published in 1876 and 1884 respectively, Mark Twain's literary achievements reached their peak. The former tells the story of his childhood life in Hannibal, such as the tension of exploring caves and getting lost, or digging for treasures near houses haunted by ghosts. The structure of the story is extremely tight, and the plot attracts readers everywhere. The latter mainly describes life on the Mississippi River. The above two books are Mark Twain's most proud masterpieces in his life, and they have now become immortal masterpieces in the world. His other highly acclaimed novels include "The Prince and the Pauper" (published in 1882). This novel fully expresses Mark Twain's contempt for privilege and his anger at injustice. Mark Twain's last masterpiece in his later years was "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court", which is a satirical novel, implying that democracy is better than monarchy. It has been adapted into a play and put on the stage, and has won the cheers of millions of viewers.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, although Mark Twain continued to write, he often went to various places to give academic lectures. In his later years, his name spread all over the world, and he was respected by millions of people. Oxford University also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1907. When the news of his death in 1910 was announced, the world was shocked. The death of this generation of literary giants was not only a loss for the United States, but also the fall of a superstar in the world literary world.</p>
<h3>Dreamer</h3>
<p>— Mo Zong</p>
<h3>Ding Jingshen as Depicted by Luo Liangfeng</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shushan</p>
<p>I previously discussed the portrait of Jin Dongxin, a friend of the Qing Dynasty seal engraver Ding Jingshen, which briefly mentioned him. Now, let's first look at what the "Cihai" dictionary says: "Ding Jing, name Ji, of Qiantang, courtesy name Jingshen, sobriquet Dun Ding, also known as Longhong Shanren. Like Jin Nong, he was a scholar of broad learning. He loved bronzes and stone inscriptions, and was particularly skilled in seal engraving, emulating the Qin and Han styles. He was a prominent master, pioneering the Shanghai style and revealing the extraordinary secrets of seal studies for over a thousand years. He authored 'Wulin Jinshi Lu' and 'Longhong Shanguan Shi Chao.'" According to his paintings, he was also known as Yanlin and had a collection of poems called "Yanlin Ji."</p>
<p>Ding Jingshen was originally from a brewing family in Hangzhou, but he was not very wealthy, so he often worked alongside servants at home. However, he loved bronzes, stone inscriptions, and ancient paintings, to the point of obsession. When he found something valuable, he would not hesitate to exchange his clothes for it. He was also skilled in poetry and painting, and became close friends with Jin Dongxin and others in his hometown, discussing art and literature with them. Eventually, they called Ding's residence south of the city "Poetry Country." His personality was particularly unrestrained, and whenever things didn't go his way, he would drink all day long, making it a habit.</p>
<p>Luo Erfeng, name Pin, courtesy name Xunfu, also known as Huazhisi Seng, was from Zhe County during the Qing Dynasty and one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." He excelled at painting figures, landscapes, flowers, grasses, plum blossoms, and bamboo. He was a protégé of Jin Dongxin, and his "Stories of Ghosts" was the most famous work of his time. His poetry was also otherworldly, and he remained a commoner throughout his life.</p>
<p>I now see a rubbing of a portrait of Mr. Ding Jingshen, from the hand of this painter, with a seal that reads "Luo Pin of Yangzhou." The eccentricity of his style is evident from just looking at this painting of an old man. At the time, a poem was inscribed alongside the picture, which reads:</p>
<p>"The ancient and extreme portrait of Longhong, abstract and about to take flight like Peng. He looks at inscriptions, stretching with great interest, leaning on his staff from the mossy shore. An unconventional recluse, a great commoner in the world. As if searching for tadpole characters, returning to the temple of Cangjie."</p>
<p>The inscription at the end reads: "Inscribing on the portrait of Layman Longhong, as instructed by Mr. Liangfeng, Yuan Mei." The spirit of this portrait has already been fully conveyed by this poem. There is also a poem by Wu Cangshi, which I will omit here. Also, at the beginning of his poetry collection "Yanlin Ji," there is a portrait of the old man painted by Chen Lin, which is also similar to this portrait.</p>
<p>This portrait later belonged to the "Ding Family's Helu Collection," but it was originally taken to Yangzhou by Luo Liangfeng himself. According to Ding Sou's handwritten poem "Sending the Poet Luo Jun Xunfu Back to Yangzhou":</p>
<p>"Time flies even faster when away from home, how can I bear to see you off without reluctance; the spring breeze has not yet tethered your游舫, and the night rain especially comes to wet the fishing bank. No chance to share the joy of wine, and my dreams are vague; only one thing brings me some comfort, inside the箱裏, my form and bones return with you.(Xunfu painted a large portrait of me leaning on a staff and sitting on a rock to take home.)"</p>
<p>There is also a poem titled "Again Receiving Paintings and Shoes from the Old Man, Replying with a Quatrain": "You gifted me paintings and light shoes, intending to ascend the highest peak above the clouds; new moss grows lushly on the covered shore, allowing only light steps to trace the path."</p>
<p>Regarding this, there is also a painting and poem by Luo Liangfeng to Ding Sou, which I will omit. The friendship between the two can be seen from this; but I wonder if people in today's art world still have such sentiment.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 56</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"What about Engineer Wu?" I didn't want him to ramble on. He was a Shandong native who grew up in Korea. He didn't speak Chinese clearly, nor was his Japanese very good, but he was quite loyal and brave.</p>
<p>"The third time we ran over, we went around in a big circle, climbed over from the backyard of the factory...went around to the east side of the railroad, and ran right into a temporary martial law at the station. The acquaintance on the station told me, 'Commander Song's special train has passed, and there are two cars of guards'...He also told me that the women of Changxindian were robbed, two or three hundred of them, all taken to Gaojiaji, which is two miles northeast of here... I thought Engineer Wu's wife and the group must be among them. What should we do?"</p>
<p>"Yes...what did you do?" I anxiously urged him to continue.</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Secretary-General," he said as if reciting a book. "We had to risk our lives to take a chance and rush to Gaojiaji. There were corpses all along the way, mostly women who had been robbed. We pretended to be Japanese plainclothes, mixed into the group, but no one came to question us. There were many Japanese soldiers there, and the local gentry of Gaojiaji provided them with wine and entertainment. We entered the comfort station, and the situation was even more chaotic. The women were all numbered, and in the three houses and garden, all their clothes were stripped off... The Japanese soldiers drew lots, and whoever drew it would take them to another room. There were many Chinese thugs wandering among the women. The five of us discussed it and also randomly asked, 'Who is Engineer Wu's wife, Xiao Zuan?'...We asked everyone, but no one answered. We didn't recognize them, but they all didn't seem like her...</p>
<p>"If she's not here, maybe she was taken away after being drawn in the lot. If she was taken away, it's useless to save her. We sneaked out again, and no one discovered us. The place was really chaotic. I didn't care who it was, and we rushed back to the station. We ran into Engineer Wu's car on the road, and we waved him down and came here all the way. Just now I saw the old woman under the tree. I thought it was the Engineer's wife. I asked her, and she said that the wives and young ladies had all hanged themselves in the backyard..."</p>
<p>We turned around and looked at the courtyard and went into the back room, but no one was to be seen. There was no one in the kitchen. Suddenly, we heard a comrade shouting at the back door, "They're here." It was the toilet behind the house. We looked out of the house, and it was truly tragic. Three women...Mrs. Wu, Meijun, and Lanjun, were all hanging together, but each of them had several bullet holes in their bodies; probably when they were discovered, they had just died tragically, so they were still covered in blood.</p>
<p>I ordered the men under me to arrange these bodies and went to the front.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look like a fainting spell, but rather a mental illness, very high degree." A young officer explained Dingyuan's situation to me.</p>
<p>"He was sick to begin with," I told him, "neurasthenia, and he's been so stimulated, maybe it's added other symptoms...I think Beiping can still hold out for a while. We'll send him to Beiping, either to find a doctor or to go to the hospital...I don't know if we can get through on the road...?"</p>
<p>"Let's try. I'm afraid there's no better way for the time being. The team leader agreed."</p>
<p>We immediately handed the submachine gun and a bag of bullets to Number 〇 Four and told him to clean up here and come to the ×× Hotel in Beiping to find me. A telegram would also be fine.</p>
<p>Inside the car, Dingyuan started talking incoherently, constantly shouting, "Fen..., where are the children?...Fen...where are the children?" (End of Chapter)</p>
<h3>Bitter Memories—Preface to "Golden Rooster Heart"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingyan</p>
<p>After proofreading the Shanghai version of "Golden Rooster Heart" (the Chongqing version is titled "Tears of Flowers"), I can't help but think of two good friends who initially encouraged me and helped me with my playwriting—Yu Si and Zuo Ming! Although they aroused my interest in playwriting, I have actually been writing for ten years. Even though it's not good, I have written more than a dozen plays. I ask myself, I have always been worthy of my two good friends. But what about themselves? One followed the War of Resistance, drifting and suffering to the point of no return, poor to the point of no return, not to mention writing plays, they don't even have the mood to write a letter! The other is even more miserable! He was killed by poverty and illness during the War of Resistance, and finally dropped his pen with regret, and went far away! Went to a world that is dark and boundless, went to a illusory realm where I will never see him or find him!</p>
<p>I remember twelve years ago, through Yu Si's introduction, I entered Tianyi Film Company. At that time, my basic job was to edit the self-promotion page of the company's Star Daily. In order to collect promotional materials, I had to visit the shooting site every night. Gradually, I became interested, so I often discussed some film art issues with Yu Si. He kindly instructed me without finding it troublesome, which made me start to have a deeper understanding of film art. Also, because I was learning painting and music at the time, I naturally became connected with film! Soon, Zuo Ming, Hong Shen, Cao Xuesong and other gentlemen joined Tianyi one after another, so I absorbed some knowledge about drama from Zuo Ming. After my novel "Drought" was published, Zuo Ming happily said after reading it: "Your novel is very dramatic, you might as well adapt it into a script!" I was also very happy after hearing this, but I didn't dare to start immediately. I thought I would study it more. Although I had written a one-act play a long time ago. But I always hope that the second time I write it, I can make some progress.</p>
<p>Who knew that after working in Tianyi for less than a year, I was arrested and imprisoned for no reason when I returned to my hometown to visit relatives, on suspicion of political crimes. Bored in prison, I carefully pondered the method of playwriting. At that time, I had a collection of novels translated by Ba Jin on hand, so I chose the article "Revenge" to adapt into a one-act play. After I was released from prison, this script was highly appreciated by Yu Si and Zuo Ming, and was named "Blood Debt". (In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the consciousness was reprocessed and it became a propaganda script for the War of Resistance. Published by Independent Publishing House in 1938.) Then I collaborated with Zuo Ming on the movie script "Sisters in Distress". (Produced by Jixing Film Company, starring Ms. Hu Shan.) We thought of the story together. When writing, I divided the scenes and he divided the shots. I wrote the lyrics for the interlude, and Mr. Huang Zi composed the music. (Recorded by Baidai Company.) During this period, I also entered the Central Film Studio as a compilation and directing committee member. Just after I finished writing the movie script "Model", the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, so Zuo Ming and I led the Anti-Japanese Salvation Fifth Drama Team to the Northwest. However, when we arrived in Kaifeng, we broke up. I independently participated in the war zone drama team of the Sixth Department of the Military Commission as a compiler and director. This was the first time I officially got involved in drama. I worked for a long time until I went to Wuhan to edit the "Tanka" literary monthly, then I left the drama team. After the fall of Wuhan, I went to Chongqing. During this period, Yu Si traveled around and lost his place, and Zuo Ming lived far away in northern Shaanxi. We lost contact with each other for three years. Finally, we reunited in Beibei, Ba County, but Yu had not been in charge for a long time, and Zuo Ming was seriously ill! We originally wanted to cooperate and do some drama again. But Yu Si was not interested, and Zuo Ming had no energy. They were worn out by the War of Resistance, both physically and mentally! Only me, I am still tirelessly writing foolishly, writing some plays that cannot get rid of the literary atmosphere and are considered tepid. "Golden Rooster Heart" is a product of this time. Yu Si helped me plan the division of scenes, and Zuo Ming helped me consider the dialogue. They encouraged me, helped me, and placed their hopes on me alone. Whether in friendship or at work, they treated me like their sister, and sometimes even like taking care of one of their own children! Because of this sincere friendship, I didn't want to let them down, so I continued to write foolishly, until I watched Yu Si become poor and sick and finally died, and Zuo Ming died, so I also ended my playwriting career wearily by writing "Dream of the Red Chamber"! Will I never write plays again in the future? I'm not sure, but anyway, I know that as long as I write plays again, I will think of Yu Si and Zuo Ming, think of these two friends who fell in a society of cold and warmth, and I will be in pain! In pain, what can I write!</p>
<p>Yu Si and Zuo Ming are finished. Who made them finish? The War of Resistance! They sacrificed everything for the War of Resistance, even their lives! But what did they get? And who still remembers them? Not to mention condolences, no one even mentions it. The country ignores them so much, and friends treat them so unkindly. Such a world, such human hearts! It makes those who are alive (Yu Si) shudder, and those who have died (Zuo Ming) will die with their eyes closed!</p>
<p>I would like to dedicate "Golden Rooster Heart" to my two good friends Yu Si and Zuo Ming. Please believe that no matter what world you are in, I, who you once encouraged and helped, will never, ever forget your friendship?</p>

<h3>Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The foreign colleagues who specialize in interviewing news from military and police agencies yesterday sent an open letter to Xuan Tiewu, the garrison commander and police chief. Although this letter is very simple, it contains an indignation for the freedom of the press ignited by a high degree of enthusiasm for work.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, our war correspondents went through life and death, galloping on the front lines. Many high-level headquarters had their traces. They were often guests of honor of the generals. Not only did they know the enemy's situation, but they also understood the national army's combat plans. If military secrets are to be mentioned, these are the most confidential.</p>
<p>After the victory, in the capital, reporters often visited Marshall's residence and Stuart's embassy; in Guling, President Jiang and his wife met with journalists almost every day. Speaking of people, these are the most respected people.</p>
<p>We don't need to mention Roosevelt's Atlantic Charter anymore. Even with regard to the public security work in Shanghai, the value and power of journalists' contributions to society is no less than that of military and police agencies. However, one is active and the other is passive, but they all lead to the same goal. Here, let's give a simple example: For example, the garrison headquarters executed several drug traffickers. If the newspapers did not widely publish it, how could the government's intention to prohibit drugs and warn people not to violate the law be achieved?</p>
<p>Foreign colleagues, for the sake of readers, add a page of hard work for every day they work. They suffer and starve, endure hardship and work hard. They are not busybodies, nor are they lunatics, but with the sacred task at hand, they have to do it. Shanghai is closely watched by the world and is the cultural center of the country. It is hoped that all phenomena in this city, which is at the forefront of civilized progress, will show progress, and freedom of the press is the most important of these!</p>
<p>Shanghai Inside Story</p>
<h3>The Thirty-Six Gangs Rampant at the Docks</h3>
<p>— Xue Ou</p>
<p>Recently, when foreign ships import goods and unload them on shore, theft and shortages often occur. This is definitely not something that ordinary pickpockets can do, but is done by the organized thirty-six gangs at the docks.</p>
<p>Speaking of the thirty-six gangs at the docks, almost all old Shanghainese have heard of them, which shows their long history. They are a kind of disguised ronin. Their lives and actions are between hooligans and good-for-nothings, but their power has been deeply rooted, so although the police authorities have tried their best to search and arrest them, the effect is actually minimal. Now, these thirty-six gangs at the docks are still rampant everywhere.</p>
<p>The thirty-six gangs have special differences from the real dock scoundrels. Most of the thirty-six gangs are half-way converts, while dock scoundrels must have been born into that life. So now, many of the old brothers of the thirty-six gangs are originally hooligans who have transformed themselves. The reason for this is nothing more than that hooligans cannot find a place to live in their place of origin, and their economic lives have no place to settle down, so they have no choice but to join the thirty-six gangs and become a small soldier to be driven, and gradually promoted to a formal gang member.</p>
<p>The docks occupied by the thirty-six gangs usually have a certain location. They each dominate a dock, which is the same as the heroes and heroines in old novels each dominating a mountain top. They regard the docks as private property and do not allow other gangs to intrude without authorization. For example, if it is the dock of the Qingjiang Gang, the Shandong Gang is not allowed to intervene. Even if something happens to colleagues and they have to go to another gang's territory, they must send someone to talk to the other party in advance, otherwise there may be a large-scale melee. In the past, they often had melees over the docks, injuring people and shedding blood, and they did not regret it.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai steamboat docks, countless merchants and cargo are transported to and from the ships every day, making them very busy. The old brothers of the thirty-six gangs mingle in it, taking the opportunity to show off their skills and make a living. In the past, their attention was focused on individual merchants, hard robbery and soft theft, their skills were amazing, and they often demanded kickbacks from the owners of private boats, who had to give them even if they didn't want to. Now that foreign goods are constantly being imported, their golden age has arrived. As long as they use their skillful hands, no matter how big or small the packages are, as long as they steal them, it is enough for them to eat, drink and enjoy themselves, so the daily life of these members of the thirty-six gangs is very carefree!</p>
<p>The existence of the thirty-six gangs at the docks is a morbid state of Shanghai society and is harmful to merchants and travelers. Therefore, I hope that the police authorities can try their best to search and arrest them, and it is best to establish a dock patrol team to frequently patrol the docks to prevent the thirty-six gangs from showing off their skills and to ensure the safety of merchants and travelers.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— W.W.</p>
<p>Various celebrations for National Day, some celebrate "bumper harvest", some celebrate "cleanliness", the dough is gloomy and thin, the "reason" cannot be explained.</p>
<p>Ding Shu was tired of being unfree in prison, and he can be quiet when he is buried in a silent wild village one day; Zhou Ni Fohai is boundless, he threw himself into the sea of bitterness, so he did not say he was unfree.</p>
<p>Chinese literati have said: "I have a pen like a knife"! The momentum was loud, how long ago was it? The ballpoint pen was invested, "all brothers within the four seas", the brothers are all in danger, even the butcher's knife dare not try it out!</p>
<p>Fashion, makeup, shoes and socks, beauty...most are planned for women, and women are planning for these, using each other, responding to supply and demand, economically speaking, it is indeed a good phenomenon, celebrating the future of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>An Average of Two People Are Run Over by Jeeps Every Day</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch published in a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper, in August, the number of jeep-related injuries in this city, in Guangci Hospital alone, has accommodated 35 injured people, including 27 men and 8 women. In addition, there were 20 seriously injured and 5 deaths.</p>
<p>It seems that an average of at least two Shanghai compatriots are sacrificed under the wheels of jeeps every day. However, Shanghai has more than just "Guangci" Hospital, and "jeeps" kill people not only in Shanghai. In addition to this city, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin...have all become their rampant areas, and the number of accidents is no less than that of this city.</p>
<p>Every day two people, should it be multiplied several times? Or dozens of times? Unfortunately, it is not easy to obtain accurate statistics for a while. However, let’s take the lowest calculation of ten times. Jeeps can destroy the happiness of at least seven hundred and thirty families in a year!</p>
<h3>Jeep's Confession</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>I am a Jeep, nicknamed Atomic Tiger, born in the United States during the war, five years old this year. In the past, I traveled on the battlefield, charging and killing enemies, but today I crash around and pass through without obstruction. We don’t know what a note is. Our awe-inspiring power is the note, the hat and clothes of our master are the note, and the signature on the card of our master is the note.</p>
<p>We don't have the habit of giving way. When we move forward at high speed, we are like a rapid wind and lightning. Pedestrians, carriages, and horses, as long as they see our shadow in the distance, will immediately be careful to get out of the way. Otherwise, if something goes wrong and blood is shed, they will know that it is their own fault!</p>
<p>My master has a lot of courage. He took me through red lights, across pedestrian crossings, destroyed big trees, and broke walls. Ending some small lives is commonplace for us. My master has never cared about the dead. He opens the throttle and takes me back to the "department". The sky does not know, people do not know, even if they do, what can be done? As for the attacks in the newspaper and the reality of society, my master said: "Let him attack, I will drive my car fast!" We have always been carefree and caused trouble everywhere. Although the principle is lacking, the momentum is always strong!</p>
<p>I am a Jeep, I am an atomic tiger, pedestrians, horses, hurry up and get out of the way, if you dare to disobey and collide with the tiger, then no matter male, female, old or young, you will be considered suicide. Citizens, please do not take my words lightly!</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— Ge Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, a certain newspaper's advertising column published: A certain mansion plans to recruit a "female wet nurse", which is unavoidable to make people laugh! Is there such a thing as a "sexual wet nurse" in the world?</p>
<p>If there is, it must be alluding to something else. As foolish as I am, I cannot imagine it.</p>
<p>Advertising text inevitably has the disease of "adding flowers to the brocade" and "stacking beds on top of each other". It is commonplace and there is no need to be surprised. The example mentioned above is not enough to be a lesson.</p>
<p>However, reading the news also has similar problems. For example, since autumn in this city, the weather has been abnormally cold and warm, and diphtheria is prevalent. A certain newspaper issued a piece of news, the last sentence of which read: "I hope that diphtheria patients will quickly get vaccinated."</p>
<p>The big traitors in North China have a lot of money, so before the execution, they also published a large advertisement to report the "small traitor" He Chengzhuo, and said that if they did not report it, they would "die with their eyes closed."</p>
<p>When the Suzhou small traitor was escorted to the North Station, he distributed printed materials to the onlookers on the platform. The content was said to be "A letter from 300,000 orphans in the country to the national officials and elders." Without saying the content, just looking at the words "national" already makes people feel strange! Does "300,000 orphans" include "the whole country"? Moreover, "300,000 orphans" may not have written it themselves? Traitor's pen, only sees his heart tired and exhausted every day!</p>
<h3>A Merchant's Home</h3>
<p>— Zhang Fu</p>
<p>I have a relative whose family life is very interesting. Their family members are even more interesting. Such an interesting family may be rare in China, and probably rare in the world. Now I will write down their family's interesting life and things.</p>
<p>There are three main figures in this family, namely the father, the mother, and the eldest brother. The father and the eldest brother are typical businessmen. This type can be said to be typically strange. They have to commercialize everything they do, or buy in the same goods; that is to say, no matter what, they have to regard it as a transaction, just like talking about business in the market, they have to wear a hat or earn some commission. Even if it is between father and son, they do not care. Since the two of them moved the business skills in the market into the family, the mother, who is in charge of household management, was quickly influenced and became a typical commercialized housewife. So, the interesting family life between the husband and wife, the father and son, and the mother and son began:</p>
<p>The father works in a bank, and the eldest brother works in the market. When the father calls the son from the bank to buy some stocks, the son unceremoniously puts a hat on the father just like dealing with ordinary customers. Sometimes when the market fluctuates greatly, he may even put a "ruthless" hat on him. But when the son lacks funds and calls the bank to ask his father for help, the father unceremoniously raises the interest rate and earns a ticket from him, just the same. Occasionally when the son is in special need, the father takes the opportunity to be "ruthless" and will not let go unless it is at least three shares of foreign currency.</p>
<p>When the father and the eldest brother are in arrears with the mother's monthly regulations, the mother does not get angry and calculates the interest at a high rate. Moreover, once the agreed deadline arrives, there will be no arrears; but they have never torn up the contract, because they value credibility the most—they maintain credibility like talking about transactions in the market. They would rather argue and quarrel in advance to bargain, but once the "transaction" is agreed, they must fulfill their promises without any objection, although they have close relationships such as husband and wife, parents, and children.</p>
<p>Don't you think this family is too interesting?</p>
<h3>Three Innocent Swedish Princesses Go to School.</h3>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>"The Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" Yu Youren</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Walking to Sanyuan County, Shaanxi, and paying attention to both sides of the street, the plaques and signs of government offices, schools, shops, and temples will surely surprise you: the inscriptions on them are almost all from the hand of one person, and that person is Mr. Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>Even if you have never met President Yu, it is not difficult to identify him from any group photograph in which Mr. Yu participates, because President Yu is the "Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" famous throughout the country, with a large beard under his cheeks, resembling a living immortal.</p>
<p>Started in the Newspaper Business</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is not only a politician and calligrapher, but also a journalist. In the late Qing Dynasty, he presided over the Shenzhou Daily in Shanghai. He once ran the "Min Hu Bao" (People's Cry Newspaper), advocating revolutionary ideas to the people at that time. It was banned. Mr. Yu was not discouraged and continued to run the "Min Yu Bao" (People's Appeal Newspaper), advocating the same views. It was banned again. Mr. Yu then changed to run the "Min Li Bao" (People's Stand Newspaper) and also served as the chief writer. Shao Lizi, a veteran of the Party and State, and the late Ye Chucang both worked for the newspaper.</p>
<p>His calligraphy initially followed the Northern Wei style, then he liked to practice cursive script in middle age, and devoted himself to the study of Zhang Cao script in his later years. His characters are like caged snakes dancing, seemingly quite casual at first glance, but upon closer inspection, each stroke is magical, showing profound skill. Mr. Yu paid the most attention to the structure of characters. He would definitely imitate the strokes of famous calligraphers, both ancient and modern, whom he considered to have reached the level of divine skill. He considered the characters "Sun Wen" personally written by Sun Yat-sen and the character "Xing" written by the martyr Huang Xing to be extremely wonderful and had repeatedly copied them. Most of the scrolls he wrote for others were stamped with two special seals, one being "Crying and Laughing at the Universe, a Cuckoo," and the other being "Half Crying, Half Laughing, Eating the Master." Mr. Yu was capable of poetry and authored "Yu Youren's Poems," but it is rare to see his works in recent years.</p>
<p>President Yu has a fondness for collecting antiques, and a special room is opened in his private residence for storage. During his spare time, the "Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" often stays in it, stroking them tirelessly, and finds it a source of joy.</p>
<p>Chili Cuttlefish</p>
<p>Mr. Yu loves to eat chili peppers and cannot do without them at every meal. It is said that in his hometown of Sanyuan County, there is a restaurant called "Mingde Pavilion" that has a specialty dish called "Chili Braised Cuttlefish." The cooking method is perfect, and Mr. Yu finds it delicious, praising it endlessly. He specially inscribed "Famous Chef Zhang Rong," which was later made into a plaque and hung on the door as an advertisement to attract customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu has served as President of the Control Yuan for more than ten years. Recently, he was appointed to Xinjiang as a senior police officer in the reorganization and inauguration ceremony of the provincial government. At the same time, he is also the leader of the inspection teams in various places, leading his "Tiger-Fighting Generals" to various places to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the receivers, causing those "officials in charge of taking over" to have sleepless nights. We hope that Mr. Yu will show the courage and spirit he had when he founded the "Min Li," "Min Yu," and "Min Hu" newspapers in his youth, and when he entered Shaanxi in the fourth year of the Republic of China to organize the Jingguo Army to fight against Yuan Shikai, to kill several "tigers" with definite evidence of guilt, to eliminate harm for the people, to strive for prestige for the government, and to maintain some dignity for the country!</p>
