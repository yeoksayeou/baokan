<h3>馬歇爾周恩來昨晤談　徐永昌由渝飛京　三人小組會下週可望重開</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中共代表周恩來，四日上午十時赴海寗路五號馬歇爾特使官邸，作到京後之苜次拜會，談一小時許，依據周氏今晨對記者發表之談話觀察，中共對鄂中衝突雖仍强調未已，據記者探悉，鄂中戰事因國軍僅作防禦措施，被迫應戰，未採取攻勢，事態殊不若外傳嚴重，預料該區戰事日內即可停止。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕軍事三人小組會政府代表徐永昌將軍，四日下午二時半由渝乘專機抵京，據吿本報記者：關於重開東北談判一事，政府俟接獲中共答覆後，即擬舉行。聞蔣主席四日晚將召見徐永昌將軍，據消息靈通者言，如中共能推誠接受馬歇爾特使勸吿，命令東北共軍退出畏春，並釋放在長春被共軍拘禁之政府官員曁中外記者，三人小組會議，可望於下週重開。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕馬歇爾特使四日與周恩來會談，續商東北停戰問題，約歷一小時牛，此爲馬周二氏在京第一次會議，政府代表徐永昌今日由渝抵京，下次開會時亦將出席參加。今日談話未聞有何進步，周恩來曾提議派遣三十人小組至華中執行停戰，東北問題，仍因政府宣言共軍須先交出長春，方能成立協議，致陷僵局。若雙方固執己見，勢將危及全國和平。</p>
<h3>周恩來談話</h3>
<p>〔法新聞社南京四日電〕中共代表周恩來將軍，本日招待各報記者，發表談話，略謂：關於東九省停戰之談判，最近曾在重慶舉行，結果歸於失敗，其最大原因爲國民黨方面堅持在簽訂停戰協定前，政府軍先行佔領長春，此一條件，不能為中共接受。談判今後將在首都繼續進行，本人此次來京，主要目標乃在湖北局勢。周氏證實中共軍已佔據東九省北部哈爾濱及齊齊哈爾兩大城市，綏分河至滿洲里鐵路東西兩側區域，已樹立人民政權，但周氏不能指出該鐵路沿綫軍隊之地位，蓋其中多數均爲非正規軍隊故也。周氏並證實最近迭次談判中，曾提出華北美國海軍陸戰隊駐紥問題，但拒絕宣布任何詳情，關於中共反對美國帮助中國運輸軍隊前往東九省，向美國提出之抗議，是否已接到答復一層，周氏亦拒絕有所表示，僅謂：關於此點，情形已略有變化，即以前美軍運輸中國軍隊，目的在收復東九省主權，此刻彼等正在運輸進行內戰之軍隊。周氏續稱：美國政府與人民無意干涉中國內部糾紛，余深信不疑，關於此層，杜魯門總統業已提供保證矣。中國共產黨贊成美國式的民治及林肯總統所揭　之政府原則，即民治及民有一項原則，實較贊成蘇聯制度爲甚。國民黨對於中共與蘇聯關係如表懷疑，則彼等對中共與美國之關係，亦應表示懷疑。中共在東九省要求民主，中共無意獨佔東九省，亦不贊成東九省應歸一黨統治，將來中央政府改組，各黨聯合內閣成立之後，東九省應由國民黨，中國共產黨及當地人民代表共同管理之。以外交關係而論，吾人並不贊成東九省成爲反蘇聯的根據地，亦不贊成對美國人有差別待遇，吾人所需者，厥唯國際合作而已。外傳中共已與蘇聯答訂條約十二款之說，絕非事實，中共從未代表中國與任何外國簽訂條約。</p>
<h3>唐代塑像　西北考察團搜集存漢口被敵破壞</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口四日電〕前西北科學考察團在西北搜集之古物百箱，曾有二十七箱係裝置唐代塑像，於戰前運抵漢口，寄存上海銀行倉庫，嗣武漢淪陷，即託由美方移存英商隆茂銀行，太平洋戰爭發生，敵人將是項古物盜移僞中江銀行，現敎部派員來漢搜尋，發現此項古物已殘破不堪，難以辯認。按唐代塑像於硏究佛敎文化極有價値，今竟遭受如此破壞，實我文化一大損失。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平四日電〕平市各界，今晨十時半在太和殿舉行五四紀念大會，參加者遠四萬餘人，由主席郭登鰲報吿紀念意義。行營李主任對全體訓話，次由熊市長等訓話，旋通過電呈蔣主席致敬及宣言，十一時在歡呼　中閉會，全體即作市內大遊行。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國大準備會議今開第四次會議，到代表二百十四人，由何冰如等七人主席，旋討論通過：（一）硏究憲草案，（二）以大會名義電共黨停止非法軍事行動，以保和平，（三）定期招待馬歇爾元帥。又籌備會主席團已經各地推定張劍鳴（浙），相菊潭（蘇），張靜愚（魯），陳紫楓（皖），李孫齋（豫），陳疇（鄂），蘇村圃（贛），方少雲（粵），劉通（閩），劉嶽厚（湘），曹經沅（川），許幹芳（京），朱鳳梧（滬），詹世安（靑），白瑞賈鴻珠（蒙），黃志大沈靈修（僑），何冰如，奚玉書，胡定安，朱經農，戴天球（自由職業）等二十四人，幹事會由馬元放，朱惠淸，王寄一，香玉堂等四十一人爲幹事，幹事會下共設總務，文書，硏究，宣傳，交際，調査，財務七組，以辦理籌備會議之經常會務，至國民大會召開日爲止。又據國大籌備委員會邵主委力子談，國大召開之確期，現尙難預測，因須俟國內局勢安定，各項問題獲得合理解決後，再行召開，就目前局勢推論，大會若延至今秋舉行，比較合適。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕三四兩日國大代表赴籌委會繼續接洽招待者，有王曉籟，王陵基等廿九人。</p>

<h3>豫鄂交界處衝突問題　軍調部竟日協商　派赴永年小組定明日出發</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕軍調部昨竟日協商豫鄂交界東部國共兩軍衝突問題，中共要求立即增派兩個小組前往調查調處，否則必因此引起全一部衝突，而使眾調部之功積化為烏有，協議結果，原則同意派小組前往。聞討論此問題之同時，政府方面提出增派小組赴高密，南通及熱河東部，熱河東部者，乃因該地共軍近曾向東北調動，此問題亦經三方原則同意增派小組前往調查調處，但未有具體決定。派赴永年小組飛機失事後，政府已另派張朝書中校，美方改派奧羅森為代表，定六日出發，石家莊中共人員被扣，一怒全體返平後，軍調部已電該小組美方代表調查真象。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國民政府還都</h3>
<p>今天上午，國民政府舉行還都大典。中樞當局和京市各界代表，將在國父陵寢之前，莊嚴肅穆，慶祝國府凱旋還都。我們臨此盛典，歡欣萬分。但回想起廿六年十二月間日寇侵入首都時的暴行，回想八年血戰歲月中人民的痛苦，或則隨軍輾轉，顚沛流離，或則受敵宰割，呻吟憔悴，今天勝利九閱月，政府宣吿還都，眞所謂「痛定思痛」。我們歡欣鼓舞之餘，直是感想萬千。</p>
<p>第一，我們欣幸　主席的精神，健康如昔。主席領導全國軍民，八年奮鬥，旣已贏得了勝利；我們更相信，主席必能領導全國，繼續奮鬥，贏得水久和平，——國家的和平與世界的和平。「和平，奮鬥，救中國，」這是國父臨終的遺言，我們永遠不會忘記。今天　主席躬率文武百官，祝吿陵寢，也一定實踐遺囑，吿慰國父在天之靈。「和平，統一，民主，團結」，旣爲全國上下的共同期望，我們就得在　主席領導之下，一秉眞誠，向着這個顯明的目標邁進。　主席在抗戰期間。日理萬幾。軍事外交政治經濟叢集於一身，決大疑，定大策。終使國家渡過鶯濤駭浪，違到勝利的彼岸，鬚髮斑白，就是他乾惕憂勤的實證。所幸　主席六十高年，精神矍鑠，依然不讓靑年。還都之前，　主席旣先飛蒞北平京滬，撫慰陷區同胞，近復飛往黔蓉陜鄂，巡廻視察，而對陪都川省尤致股股惜別之意，風塵僕僕，席不暇暖。　主席這種精神，就是國家前途光明的致徵。我們崇敬主席，無諭官吏人民，就得各自隨分報國，盡其職責，不可再累　主席分心小事。我們要多讓主席留出時間和粉神來主持國家的大計；這纔是愛戴　主席，愛護國家。</p>
<p>第二，我們敦促謀國的各方，共同履行諾言。國府還都，應該是和平建國的開始。然而「政協」會議的和平建國綱領，軍隊的整編統編方案，停戰命令，以及協議事項，這一套和平所繫的決議，三四個月之間，始終沒有見到切實的履行。　主席在「政協」開幕之日所宣布的四項諾言，早已逐一見諸事實，而其他應爲各方所共同信守者，却在推三宕四之中。時人論中共對於時局的做法，說他們要做到「一切皆過程，始終無結論；」大概共產黨的高明就在這「無結論」的一點。軍隊的縮編應該是結論了；可是如何統編，統編之前如何開立名單，他們又擺出了許多過程，而統編就遭擱置。停戰應該是結論了；可是如何調處，小組如何執行，而一方調處，他方又在挑釁，遂致停戰也終於在過程中徘徊。改組國民政府，召開國大制憲，應該是結論了；可是力爭名額多寡，不開代表名單，使國府充實改組為之停頓，國民大會開會因而延期，這兩件大事又停擺於過程之中。至於東北問題，原本不成問題，蘇軍撤退，中央接收，名正言順，理無異議，然而忽有所謂「民主聯軍，」忽有圍攻長春之戰，於是接收東北又在過程中閙了別扭。諸如此類，背信的舉動，太使人頭痛了，我們以為謀國的各方，果眞要使國家走上和平統一民主團結的大道，就得大家拿出良心來，共同履行一切的諾言，老百姓決不容許任何一方再玩「過程」的把戲，始終避開「結論」的實踐。</p>
<p>第三，我們願望政府勇於自責，與民更始。回想日冠的侵略，大原因還是由於我們的自侮。民國成立二十多年，蹉跎歲月，一事無成，「謾藏誨盜」，遂引起日寇蠶食鯨看的妄念。如今好容易，賴全國軍民的流血流汗，友邦盟國的聯合援助，獲得了最後勝利，我們尤不可痛還未定而就忘了痛，大家又快要亨福起來。尤其是政府當局，興需領導全民，痛改前非，「晏安酖毒」，古有名言；何況世界糧荒，全國饑僅，人民救死不邊，而強鄰帶處，邊圉未固，第五從隊到處活躍，現在我國的內憂外患，何嘗有遜於抗戰以前，我們又豈容高枕無憂？國府此晶還都，正該昭告百官，與民更始。節少一切廢費，裁汰一切冗員，廢止不適時宜的如毛法令，裁撤有害民生的苛捐雜稅，整飭官常，嚴肅風紀，眞正做到「民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之。」中國老百姓，是世界上最馴良的人民，最易治的人民。只要政府少辦幾件擾民的政事，官吏少出幾個擾民的主意，人民便已受惠不淺，稱頌「德政」，口碑載道的了。我們由衷的擁護政府，更由衷的愛戴　領袖；我們也不怕外來的强暴，更不怕內在的叛變。我們所最懸慮的，却是官吏的貪汚百出，政府的泄沓成風！我們以爲今日爲政之要，先在根絕食貪汚，而根絕貪汚的方法，就在正視現實，首先懺悔過去輕視將士和公敎人員待遇問題的失策，從頭糾正過來。政附不但對此須懺悔，而且須勇於改過，勇於負責，設法改善他們的待遇，政府應有決心，大刀闊斧的幹，寗可擱置一切的「新政」，而先集中其力量於穩定物價；寗可節省其他的政費，而儘先盡量設法提高軍隊官兵與公敎人員的薪餉待遇。試思：倘要眞建設一個現代化的國家，將官士兵吃不飽，公務人員吃不飽，學校敎師吃不飽，還能有什麽希望！政府的責任，本須爲全民打算吃飽穿暖的方法，而軍隊官兵和公教人員的吃飯問題，乃是政府應該負責的第一個問題。否則要肅淸貪汚，認眞辦事，豈非等於徒託空言？我們以爲還都以後的國民政府，一定是一個正視現實與民更始的政府。</p>

<h3>外長會議僵局難打開　四強間意見愈深　昨討論義南邊界問題又無結果　和會勢將無限期拖延</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：四強外長今日又舉行會議，討論南斯拉夫與義大利之邊境問題。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫對於英美外長所建議之南義兩國邊境，表示反對，據謂英美建議，無異處罰南斯拉夫，南國在戰時為聯合國家之盟國，今竟受罰，殊欠公允。各外長討論甚久，仍無結果。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎四日電〕四國外長會議，對各主要問題迄今意見未獲一致，今日開會時所討論者為廢除義國邊境防禦工事及有關義國戰前與各國所訂條約等比較簡單之問題。據稱：義大利與法國及南斯拉夫接壤之處防禦工事是否廢除將由外長會議決定。義大利以前與他國締結之條約，亦將提出討論，以視其中有否可繼續保留者。今日會議充滿悲觀空氣，一部份原因，係為義大利及南斯拉夫疆界問題，無獲得解決之望。此外義大利屬領之處理及賠款問題亦難解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三日電〕四國外長會議今日繼續在　森堡古宮開會，關於義大利與南斯拉夫疆界問題，兩國代表意見衝突，義總理加斯貝利自稱係代表愛好和平的新興義大利發言，請外長會議依據舊「威爾遜界綫」劃定義南兩國疆界，以特里埃斯特港歸義大利。南斯拉夫副總理喀爾台偕外長西米克及顧問七人蒞會，發言歷三小時半，堅持特里埃斯特港及伊斯特里半島之大部份應劃歸南斯拉夫。傳喀爾台幾將要求伊斯特里半島靠亞得里亞海之全部，及特里埃斯特港統歸南國所有。同時義大利則堅持該港及其內地一部份，仍應歸義大利。外長會議將於明日舉行非正式會議，討論此一問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎三日合眾電〕據官方人士視察，四外長可能在公開討論下，未獲致任何大部協議時，即收拾行裝歸國。經一週來無結果之會商，蘇與西歐國家間意見之齟齲，只有尖銳化而已。設如在和約草案上，未獲致任何協議，原定五月一日召開之和平會議，勢將無限期拖延。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科三日合眾電〕塔斯社巴黎訊稱：貝爾納斯所提結束領佔德國之建議，實即予蘇聯另一堆廢紙，一如目前英國政府亦使英蘇同盟化為廢紙同。，不意於五月一日上午一時許，士兵因受劉某之煽惑，羣起向蘇隊長要朮發放欠餉三個月，蘇正婉言相答時，突被士兵用槍射擊當場斃命，劉吉元乃率領士兵挨戶洗劫，歷三小時之久，全隊士兵一百餘名，隨劉某搭海船東逸，查損失食米七百餘祖，財物不資，是日上午七時，乍浦區長戚志洪，親自來縣府報告，嗣與臨參會縣黨部等會商，派員赴乍宣慰並調查眞相，據內幕熟悉者告記者云，此次肇禍原因，果為欠餉三月未發，政府遽而易人，一無準備，至肇此巨禍云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕美國務院及伊朗大使館均己接得正式報吿，證實蘇聯軍隊除北部之亞塞爾拜然省外，已自伊朗全部撤退，並將於星期一前，撤離亞塞爾拜然省。伊朗當地所來之消息，均使國務院及伊朋大使阿勒相信蘇方將履行五月六日撤離伊朗之諾言，因此安全理事會可能於下星期中將伊朗問題總銷。各方來訊透露：蘇軍係於本星期撤離大不列士。</p>

<h3>蘇聯募債　二百億虜布以復興經濟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播：蘇聯政府向該國人民募集公債二百億虜布，合三十七億七千四百萬美元，用以復興及發展經濟。各地應募者源源不絕。政府雖僅　請工人以一個月工資認購公債，但工人方面多願供獻六星期至三個月之工資，個人認購者每人多至二萬五千盧布。此項公債分二十年償還，幷按照債劵號碼抽籤給獎。據財長慈維萊夫在廣播中說明，此項公債將用於戰後第一次五年計劃，並增强軍事經濟實力，購買公債者以蘇聯人民爲限，免徵財產稅及所得稅。中獎號碼，每一百盧布債券最多可獲獎金五萬盧布，幷免徵稅。蘇聯在今後若干年內從事建設，增强防務，維持國家安全，共需經費二千五百億盧布，此項公債等於所需款項總額百分之八。</p>

<h3>麥帥令罷黜鳩山　日組閣受挫　各黨奔走努力成泡影政局混沌重回出發點</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員四日專電〕幣原內閣曾於昨日遣派外相吉田晋謁麥帥，請求核准自由黨總裁鳩山一郞担任新首相。麥帥總部根據二月四日肅淸訓令，今日命日政府罷黜鳩山，褫奪其一切公職。並列舉鳩山適當於肅淸令之事實點如下，</p>
<p>（一）一九二七至二九年任田中內閣秘書長，制定治安維持法。（二）一九三地至三四年任犬養內閣文相，壓迫言論思想與集會自由。（三）强迫解散農工組織，（四）始終支持極權主義與侵略行動。</p>
<p>〔改造日報東京四日電〕麥帥總部今日宣布罷黜自由黨鳩山後，繼任內閣首揆究將誰屬，又成問題。鳩山之被褫奪一切公職，於自由黨誠如晴天霹靂，遭受致命打擊。又該黨縱岡與進步黨合作，但因社會黨有言在先，表示反對進步黨，結果准有以社會黨為中心組織內閣，或綱羅各黨，推舉超然派担任首相一職，此餐並無他途可循。於是幣原內閣瓦解後之第十三日，日政府復陷於混沌狀態。兩週內各黨間之奔走努力，終歸泡影，又須生出發。</p>

<h3>美越獄囚犯　據高臨下射擊便利與軍警格鬭十小時</h3>

<p>交由醫生檢驗</p>
<p>大川今日又出以昨日摑擊東條頭頂之怪舉動，而時向攝影人員顯露其猙獰面目。今日之目標爲總部新聞處官員史蒂克爾上尉，該上尉被此瘦弱之犯人毆擊甚猛，當時攝影人員即紛紛開動閃光燈，大拍其照。審判長魏勃見狀，即宣布指派神經病專科醫生兩人檢騐，以確定該犯心理上是否能辯護。兩醫生診斷倘不一致，則法庭當更指派第三人參加檢騐。</p>
<p>牛頭不對馬嘴</p>

<h3>紀念「五四」運動　各團體熱烈能加　電呈蔣主席並發表宣言</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨日爲五四運動二十七週年紀念日，本市各界，特於昨晨假座逸園，舉行盛大紀念會。參加者有婦女會·復旦大學·曉光中學·新建中學·浦東中學·及　阜流亡靑年團等數十單位，共計一萬餘人。塲內秩序由憲兵·保衛團·靑年團·童子軍等協同維特，警察樂隊蒞塲奏樂。大會主席團由人民自由保障會，文化運動委員會·學生總會·大敎聯·中敎聯·小敎聯·敎育會·婦女會·靑年團九團體代表陶百川·李壽雍·曹俊·錢劍秋·奚楨雍·胡懷天·高文柏·李承宣·費樹聲等担任。來賓到有何副市長·中委潘公展·顧敎育局長·總工會周學湘等。</p>
<p>完成使命　努力和平團結</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，即由主席陶百川致詞稱：五四運動對於鞏固國家基礎，喚醒民族意識革新文化，推進社會，皆有重大影響。現今政局不安定，與當年五四時不相上下，故今日靑年應繼承五四革命精神爲和平團結努力，以完成五四未了之使命。何副市長代表錢市長訓勉靑年稱，今後復興建設工作，責任重大，故應努力於學，不尙空言，埋頭實幹，憑眞才實學，始能負此重任云。</p>
<p>靑年思想　趕速解放自由</p>
<p>潘公展氏繼之演講稱：今日紀念五四，不僅應保持此革命愛國之民族精神，更應發揚光大之。回憶自五四起，經國民革命北伐成功，以此次八年抗戰，終於獲得勝利。但現在却偏有人欲破壞此美滿成果，前幾天見報上說，共黨在東北與蘇聯簽訂密約，這是什麽條件，假使是實在的話，可說與廿一條不相上下。國家訂約應由國府負責，我國與蘇聯早已訂有中蘇友好條約，不允許再有其他任何條約，更不允許有密約。這種事實，說來痛心，廿七年前的五四運動爲了仆麽，抗戰八年爲了什麽。</p>
<p>潘氏繼稱，常年五四運動亦爲求思想之解放與自由，但一部份，靑年自「孔家店」出發，却走進「馬家店」，以馬克斯·史太林。列寗作偶像，如此則思想同爲不自由，同受束縛。故今日之新五四運動，靑年應趕緊從「馬家店」退出，達成眞正的思想自由云。顧敎育局長稱：作事應公開，不要秘書，拿出良心與主張，才爲最好之愛國遝動。至此天驟降雨，大會通過上蔣主席電及通電全國呼籲團結，如期召開國民大會，救濟流亡靑年，提高敎授待遇並發表宣言，大會遂宣告散會。原定遊行，亦因天雨中止舉行。</p>
<p>同日上午，「文協」上海分會，假座辣斐大戲院，舉行文藝晨會，孫夫人亦蒞會參加。節目有葉聖陶·周予同·許廣平等之演講，李健吾之詩歌朗誦，趙景深之大鼓，歐陽山尊·李麗蓮之「兄妹開荒」秧歌，以及崑曲·笛·小提琴等演奏。</p>

<h3>美鈔套買交易頗多　金價過程平穩　配價提高為一六二</h3>
<p>烚赤昨續平穩，中行配給價隨大衆心理稍稍提高至一六二萬。登記者四一七條，實領者三六五條，査晨開平疲，開後散戶游資稍來吸收，銀樓方面亦有扒進，曾升至一六五萬左右，無如銀根緊張，時有趨緊勢態，多方不無戒心，不久重又回落。中行配給時在一六二萬光景起伏，迨配給竣事後，直至午刻鮮有特殊活動，始終在一六三萬以下扎掙，午後人心稍形舒展，最後微穩，結果較前收稍漲一萬五，飾金十七萬五，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根雖巳見鬆，但息價尙不肯寬放，仍站二角左右，下週一有物資結款殊鉅，不可不防。</p>
<p>美鈔不乏套買，套頭再軋攏至七一〇元對十兩，幷有零星之結款，晨開二二三〇元，後一路盤升至二三四〇元，而後略有回落，在二二九〇元左右　徊，後市鮮有進展，結果較前收回好五十元，港票疲後漸穩，結果新老各漲五元，港匯四五〇元，羅比五五〇元，均見向榮，美匯掛牌仍平。</p>
<h3>黃金由美運滬</h3>
<p>共計卅九萬兩</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕在本市金價已趨平穩聲中，據記者自可靠方面探悉，昨有黃金卅九萬三千兩計分裝一二一大桶，自美由海鷹輪運抵，昨晨已由中央銀行全數運入倉庫，又昨晨中央銀行依照本市銀樓業金業需要，共拋售黃金五一八條，按照當時一六二萬元市價如數供給，本週法幣回籠爲數極夥，至向中央銀行購買外匯者，爲數亦尠，致市面上銀根奇緊。</p>
<h3>紗市轉堅　現棉交易停頓</h3>
<p>昨日紗市已見轉機，綠廣帮續有進胃，廿支雙馬回升二萬，其餘雜牌因內地帮擇廉而取，價亦好一萬至三萬，四十二支雙股綫連日所跌頗巨，已引起織造廠之納胃，零星交易，頗不寂寞，疲風似已吹過，人心已轉堅定。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報漲二至六磅昔，計近期美金二七·五八，遠期二七·七三，米特林現貨二八·一六，本埠現棉交易完全停頓，良以週六關係，而黃金與美鈔及紗價均無特殊發展，是以廠家與花號咸存觀望，毫無談判消息。</p>
<h3>絲綢疲軟</h3>
<p>紡建開售人造絲</p>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇號天橋，上午開盤一百四十八萬元，最高喊五十四萬元，結果五十一萬元收盤，下午因配給絲即日出貨，人心虛軟，回小，做一百四十五萬元，較隔日短二萬元，雜牌短三萬元，其餘各號貨，仍站上日原盤，廠經交易寂靜，洋行貨祇有問訊而無成交，八十一分勻度達昌出價二百五十萬元，用戶絲略有交易，各檔均小五萬元左右，綢貨平疲，美亞被面上午一百〇五萬元有成交，大誠格子　　每碼三千七百六十元。</p>
<p>又訊，敵產人造絲，由敵產處理已委託中國紡織建設公司拋賣，該公司於昨日公開掛牌，出售方式與拋賣棉紗情形相同，據稱數量甚鉅，現在積極淸點，決定每星期公開出售一次云。</p>
<h3>茶市漸入佳境　洋莊已開始辦貨</h3>
<p>茶市日來漸入佳境，買氣活躍，尤以天津帮對於苞種及珠蘭茶，竟有來者不拒之勢，持者趁機喊高，故價格冉冉上展，其他花色本街店莊及蘇州各地添置亦絡繹不絕，行情均呈堅定。</p>
<p>洋莊方面，目前歐美各地需求頗殷，新茶雖已登塲，外銷茶尙未製就，現由怡和洋行選擇品質優良之貨，聊應急需，聞已成交者，計陳針眉二百箱，（價每擔三萬二千元）於日內擬銷住菲洲摩洛哥，至於印度孟買，亦頻加靑睞，邇來白頭莊瑞昌洋行購進抽貢七百箱，（價每擔三萬八千元）在待機出口中云。</p>
<h3>公債繼續上漲股市欲振無力</h3>
<p>公債下週起再度迂迴，各活動份子以地盤不穩，雖欲振作，終覺乏勁，以致初開時不免軟化，曾回跌至五五〇〇元關邊，此後銀根漸鬆，並無十分恐慌刺激，乃回漲至六一五〇元左右，午刻在六千元關外盤旋，結果較前收微升一百五十元，甲乙丁自三八五〇元步升至四三〇〇元，回漲四五百元，戊種自四千元弱以四五〇〇元高價結束，漲起三五〇元，華股亦因連日緊張局勢已稍轉好，惟因散戶操之過急，後勁不繼，高價持久力弱，午刻反以低價結束，中途最高永紗五六〇〇元，美亞四七三〇元，景福四七五元，新光三九〇元，勤興三四〇元，而後逐步遭多方脫手所壓制，午收遂每况愈下，時間愈晏，喊價愈低，結果較前收熱門兩大熱繼續微挫，三小型則已回秀，較冷各股則升降均見，差度有限，外股上塲微升，怡紗在一四九〇〇元掙扎，不久華股不支而退，各股遂紛紛跟怡紗同趨下游，結果怡紗下落九百元，英聯跌一千四，其餘各股雖降而不多</p>
<h3>食糖銷咱平淡　湘蓮貨缺軋升</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉平，公會劃盤中砂白盤旋於五萬九千之間，初市爲五萬九千元，至五萬九千五百元，一度曾達六萬元，最後仍爲五萬九千元，客貨開出，成交至爲零星，蓋行方鑒於市象未穩，不敢貪進。</p>
<p>湘蓮以到存俱缺，市勢轉緊，查前盤為二十萬元左右，現本胡連身色俱佳而粒子粗大者，已升至二十二萬五千元。</p>
<h3>暹米輸出　每月可望六萬噸</h3>
<p>〔路透社新加坡四日電〕東南亞專使基能勳爵昨廣播稱，聯合糧食局估計暹羅緬甸於今年第二季可輸出米二八〇、〇〇〇噸，而實際上之輸出量，恐猶不逾一五三，〇〇〇噸，若不加速運輸，則局勢必更嚴重，自一月一日以來，暹羅已輸出米一一四，〇〇〇噸，希望今後每月能輸出六萬噸。</p>
<h3>外銷紅茶　價在錫蘭之上</h3>
<p>我國外銷紅茶，產製成本，每担的需六七萬元，滬價現爲九萬元左右，再加運輸保險等費，實在十萬元以上。據悉：錫蘭紅茶在美國市價，現爲每磅三角美金，每担約合國幣七八萬元，尙較我國內市價爲低，故頗難與錫蘭茶競爭。</p>
<h3>木材市況呆滯</h3>
<p>昨木材市面頗爲呆滯，聞洋松有二百餘萬尺已到埠，人心見軟，市塲交易，大量尙無受主，惟零星配花色，尙稱不寂，杭木及單同近日來尙有銷路。</p>
<h3>英美暹儘管訂匯率</h3>
<p>〔合衆社曼谷四日電〕暹幣與金鎊之匯兌率，昨經官定爲四十對一，暹邏貨幣現每十元折合美金一元，按照以前之半官匯兌率，每暹幣六十元合一鎊，每十五元合美金一元。</p>
<h3>米價忽上忽落麺粉雜糧回漲</h3>
<p>昨日米市消化甚呆，粳秈元米一致下挫千元左右，麵粉連跌之後，店胃轉暢，回升三四百元，油市零化轉殷，甬帮略有問津，價格止跌轉漲，回升三四千元，豆餅售性隨之扳堅，亦漲五六百元，麩皮鄕消亦動，猛漲八九百元，黃豆因各物上漲，隨之上升千餘元，生仁疲而復振，亦加一二千元，惟紅糧胃呆少神，棉餅依然下游，昨市與前日適相反，及米價回跌，油餅雜糧粉麩一致上漲，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白粳等七種，共四千餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳二，〇六六，薄稻一，〇九八，早稻六三，三羊秈一〇五，杜秈四三三，白元七五，陰元七〇。</p>
<h3>桐油成本太高　出口交易停頓</h3>
<p>中國植物油料廠去冬在渝萬等地購進之三百餘噸桐油，在萬燒煉裝桶後，今春開始起運，在萬宜段用木船起運，宜漢段則用拖輪，漢滬段方用輪運，轉運之耗費亦重，聞每市担由萬運滬需繳用約三萬元，由收購以至裝運抵滬，已需半年之久。</p>
<p>該廠首批川桐一百餘噸，近已運抵本市，此批桐油已代中央信託局交蘇聯易貨，其餘之百餘噸，可在本月內運到。</p>
<p>內地最近桐價，據聞重慶爲三萬九千元，萬縣爲三萬八千餘元，漢口爲五萬二三千元（以每市祖足度桐油爲準），滬價近以內銷較弱，外銷商又觀望未動，僅在七萬二千元左右盤旋，商家由產地運滬銷售，已無利可獲。</p>
<p>據悉，美國需要我國桐油雖殷，但爲市價所限，在滬美商現所出購價，每磅僅三角七分（美金），猶須送輪交貨，運商因不劃算，致近兩月來，桐油輸美貿易，除原成交者外，餘無訂交。</p>
<h3>猪鬃滯銷　由於尼隆盛行</h3>
<p>〔渝訊〕國際市塲，猪鬃價格有下降趨勢。據兩週前之報吿，二十七號國貨値美金三元一磅，在紐約交貨，的値法幣六十萬左右一擔。以目前重慶貨價再加其他費用，運美成本每擔即近九十萬元，若是則有賠本二三十萬元一擔之可能。按猪鬃所以步入此種不景氣狀態，主要爲尼隆之被應用。其原料易得，成本亦輕，製成物品經久耐用，而猪鬃品質低劣，未切實用，故欲挽救此種頽勢，奪回猪鬃外銷市塲，惟有設法精製，减低成本云。</p>
<h3>錢兌業呼籲　申請貨幣買賣</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市錢兌業公會，現有會負一八八家，平素營業範圍，以專營各國貨幣買賣，依照管理外匯暫行辦法第三條規定，即稱甲種准許經營行號，業經中央銀行外匯審核及格者，該會員只有八十一家，其餘一〇七家，當時誤解條文規定，對於申請手續，亦未細加硏究，乃自動放棄權利，現因朱領憑證者，有被停止業務之虞，又以本身營業，只以經營外幣鈔票買賣爲主，一旦停頓，無法維持，前已召開理事會聲肅補救辦法，昨晨理事長汪雲程親赴外匯審核處籲請補行登記，以便救濟各會員生計</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>西藥　貨主鑒於外貨源源而來，競相脫手，現貨價再見挫落</p>
<p>化工原料　連日金價美鈔下跌，原料亦隨之下瀉，市况平淡</p>
<p>皮革　大致尙平穩，惟面皮略形軟化，成交亦欠旺。</p>
<h3>電報費貴阻碍出口</h3>
<p>〔渝訊〕據進口商人談，我國對外貿易，近已漸趨活躍，惟政府所定國外電報價格頗不適合出口條件，如政府規定母次最少須發二十五字，不到二十五字者，仍照此數付費，且最近報費由三千二百五十元加至一萬九千元，較前漲高六倍，無形中增加出口貨之成本，此種發報辦法，有碍出口貿易之發展，希望政府减輕，以適合出口貿易爲原則。</p>

<p>劇評</p>
<h3>評「陞官圖」</h3>
<p>— 家</p>
<p>夢是點化，不是幻境。陳白塵在爲陞官圖演出作中寫着：我知這「陞官圖」這劇本將要刺痛某一小部份人，但它是一個普遍存在的現實，誰得否認它，那是諱疾忌醫。誰要承認它的眞實，誰才有勇氣去改進它。</p>
<p>「陞官圖」上演，一掃過去話劇賣座的淸冷，不是只由於銅錢眼，保險櫃等裝置的新奇，漫畫化了的化裝……。「陞官圖」得着大量觀衆的喜愛，這是因爲編者·導者·設計者·演者在這個戲裏表達了觀衆自己的感情，對這羣人物的憎恨與咒咀。觀衆在合下笑，是因爲台上人物的出醜，減輕了他們的愛悒，添增了他們對這羣人物的輕蔑，在笑聲裏漲飽了「噓」的意味。</p>
<p>然而，使這個演出轟動的，也不能單純的依賴原著者。假如遇到拙劣的導演·舞台設計台·演員，都能使一個絢爛的劇本失色。替「陞官圓」這個喜劇，披上了卡通的外衣，使這劇本的內容與人物更爲凸出。使現實中被蒙遮的醜惡，更爲顯明，也使得工作人員的想像有更多馳騁的空閒發揮得淋漓致盡。這個劇本如被用上寫實的手術，會變得多麽的沒有生氣！</p>
<p>佈景，是人物出沒的所在，它必得能代表這一羣主人翁的特徵。僅有一堂的佈景，設計者丁聰，把正當中的堂口開爲「銅錢眼」，牆壁是鈔票，房門是錢櫃，半空還懸着一大塊「贓」，於是往來於銅錢眼中，進出於錢櫃裏頭頂着贓，面向着鈔票的，這一羣人物，究竟是什麽東西，觀衆自可一目了然了。同樣的設計在人物的服裝，也一本人格抽象化的原則，最特出的自是財政局長頭頂元寳，脚踏元寳，身穿鈔票，身上還背着三個苛捐雜稅袋，敎育局長也不差，頭戴博士帽，身穿四書五經長袍，另一面在化裝上，也趨向漫畫作風，警察局長的面孔，簡直就是希特勒。人物中不以本身職務爲化裝標幟的是工務局長，那裏是工務局長！竟是一位摩登「胡四」！多麽辛辣的諷刺！</p>
<p>演員最好的是藍馬的省長，正經時是那麽的莊嚴穆肅，行動是那樣凝重，嬉皮笑臉的時候也充塞着身居高位的儀態。他沒有買弄技巧，造成五光十色的華采，然而他的華采是內蘊的，一顰—笑，一舉手一投足，簡單而自然，演技到了爐火純靑的地步。財政局長的賦有絕頂勢力的神情，周起是十分出色的。敎育局長的兩面光，秘書長的精明狡詐，都有獨到之處。</p>
<p>在演出方面，導演是有絕對大影響的，黃佐臨在這個戲裏，不但處理得整個舞臺活潑而有條不紊，而更是尖刻透頂，第三幕他讓省長赤膊穿着一件兜肚出塲，等到金條收足，當塲貯入兜肚上的袋內，然後就在觀衆面前穿上那件金碧輝煌嚴肅萬分的外套。第二幕，縣衙門開會懲凶，各局長都用着方言發表議論，都妙絕。然而整個戲的語言都是用國語，和第二幕不一致，這該是特別强調道一幕的原故吧！</p>
<p>陳白塵寫着：「沒有一個作者當他沐浴於陽光之下，還願意回到暗室去找尋題材的。」我讚謂這個演出，也希望不再看見這類演出。</p>

<h3>畸形的影壇</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>讀四月十四日本刋陳偉君的「出水芙蓉」影評一文後，筆者就覺得勝利後上海的影壇實在是太不入格調，太不成體統了。多的是好萊塢含色素的性感片，你若不信，每一天在戰紙上總能看到大量吸引渴於色的觀衆去一飽限福的廣吿啊！什麼「淺水池中鬥春色，三角褲下比肉香」。「玉腿」，「金腿」，「美腿」，說不盡的腿。當然亦不是每片多是如此，如最近的「威爾遜總統傳」，「忠勇之家」，「萊茵河的守衛」，「阿丹諾之鐘」等片，莫不是含義純正，使你看了以後深覺感動。帮助你增進智識。灌輸正當的文化，介紹偉大的人物在你面前，使你有所傾慕，崇拜。然而上海的觀衆是幼稚的，好奇的，而大部份觀衆也簡直不懂英語，因此就祇求神奇，燦爛奪目的五彩，引人入勝的接吻。至電影院看電影祇求一時的稱快而已。以致如後者的電影在開映時，電影院前門可羅雀，賣座奇慘。</p>
<p>在這樣情形之下，影院老板爲了營業，生意眼，與賺錢的目標就不得不把賣座的片子放映，把文藝的，生意黯淡的片子丟開，那豈不是成了一個畸形的影壇了嗎？我不禁地自嘆着。</p>
<p>更嚴重的影響；上海無數的靑年男女包括大學生，中學生，年輕的公務員，商店職員，等等，因爲覺得看電影是正當的娛樂，正當的消遣，所以他們亦不時在星期日，假日走進電影院度過二小時光景的時候，但是我想當一靑年人看到了如前述的色情片後，他會被迷惑的，很容易引入色情的淵藪的，而拋粟了自己的學業，事業。所以我爲全市愛好電影的仕女們呼籲，要求停止放映含有色情極濃厚，荒淫無比的電影！</p>

<h3>憶重慶</h3>
<p>我們今日業已東下的人，西望那雄立於揚子與嘉陵兩江所會合之處的巍峨山城，錐心的溫讀這些生命的故事，像它的季節性的濃霧一般，由朦朧而逐漸淸明。</p>
<p>我們離別重慶，我們不盡依依。</p>
<p>重慶，曾帶給我們光明，希望，正義，勝利，興奮，生命，更帶給我們溫暖。它像耶路撒冷的聖城，象徵着也寄托着不僅全中國人的虔誠的信心。它是一個最光榮而最親切的地名，我們中國人非常驕傲地呼喚着它。</p>
<p>八年歲月，無限艱辛，它的每一座屋舍，每一級山坡，每一道橋醇樑，每一口石洞，每一汪江水，每一條馬路，每一株樹，一朶花，一根草，一方泥土，都曾經寫過最動人而難忘的故事，有血，有淚，有飢餓，有寒冷，有歡樂，有憤怒。就是它，負功了這一也，也鐫畫了這一切。</p>
<p>我們今日業已東下的人，西望那雄立於揚子與嘉陵兩江所會合之處的巍峨山城，我們將沉默地流淚，錐心地溫讀這些生命的故事，像它的季節性的濃霧一般，由朦朧而逐漸淸明。</p>
<p>國府路上淸等一帶，將首先聘同在我們的記憶中，那是抗戰的神經中樞，國民政府，行政院，中央黨部，最高國防委員會，總動員會議，交通部，戰時生產局，資源委員會，……集中了百分之五十的大機關。因之，這一帶，也就成為公務員的山裝的人物特別活躍。每天早晨八點，中午十二點，下午五點前後，熙來推　往，而公共汽車的候車處，一字長蛇陣，排下半條街，無論在酷烈炎日下，在滂沱大雨中，也是這個時間最雜沓拒擁擠。</p>
<p>國民政府那座廟堂式的建築，坐臨寬敞的國府路，幽靜整潔中表現莊嚴，氣象萬千。除每星期一早晨的紀念週外，政府的許多大典都在這里舉行。林故主席森病危的時候，它的門前每天　集着無數愛戴他的市民，用着最憂戚的心情在細讀那張病况佈吿。</p>
<p>從上淸寺逶迤向南，陪都也僅此一條蜿蜒的大道，中山一路，二路，三路，直到七星崗江蘇同鄕會為止。這是重慶地勢較高的一段，也是整個山城北面的一條大動脈，其間，最高處是楷杷山，飛來寺，這是蘇聯大使館館址所在，每年蘇聯的建國紀念日和紅軍節，車水馬龍，盛極一時。</p>
<p>這一段路上，有廣播大厦，中宣部，國際宣傳處，組織產，銓叙處，外國記者招待所，美國新聞處，中央通導社，四聯總處，財政部，糧食部，衛戍總司令部，兵工署，中央日報社；純陽洞的高坡上，還有中國電影製片廠及以演出話劇著名的抗建堂。這是段心臟地帶，整個山城地形上如此，市民活動情况上也如此。</p>
<p>我們今日在上海的人，我們坐人力車或三輪車，走過四川路橋，天后宮橋，決不例外的有人替你推上一把，末了得破費你百元鈔票一張。然而這兩座橋比起從民生路若瑟堂到觀音岩止，這窮夫一段的坡度來，我們將讀嘆山城車夫的　力，而對平原地帶人們的嬌貴會感到羞郝罷。</p>
<p>創造環境，適應環境，為環境所牽引，人的心智大致是可以分這三種等級的。抗戰八年，從東南流亡到西南的大多數人，他被環境所訓練，爬山越嶺，健步如飛，這不過是生活中的一小節，這正等於吃平價米，進防空洞　般，成為日常風景。他們適應了環境，他們更進一步地創造了環境，動心忍住，精神的錘鍊，培養了民族百折不撓的執着情緒，那個望龍門的石級，那個十八梯的石級，那個凱旋門的石級，這些小物事，我們懷戀它，在不知不覺中，它所發生的作用，給我們身心的影響，將値得我們謳歌！</p>
<p>提起凱旋門，它和望龍門的江邊攬車，都是國府遷都後重慶的新興建築巨大工程之一。前者由天府建築公司承建，由於它，將上半城與下半城的中心連接起來，車馬蜴通，比如從夫子池到大平門，不必再遠遠地撓道南區公園或道門口了。它那拱形的瓊門，從軍委會門前眺望，够稱壯觀。</p>
<p>望龍門的江邊攬車，由茅以昇先生主持的中國橋梁公司興築，與築經過，頗與當年美國修建西部鐵道相彷彿，甚至市參議會作為重要議題，一部分廟堂之土橫議百出，反對激烈，茅老先生設計監修過錢塘江大橋，他端坐兩路口公司二樓辦公室內，并沒有延擱一天工程的進行。攬車正式開始營業，茅老先生才鬆了一口氣。今日，往來大江北南兩岸的人，免去上下兩百餘級石坡的疲癆，可曾想到從卅三年夏季到卅四年秋季這一年多一年多日子中，一位中國第一流工程專家，在各方攻擊下的痛苦心情？</p>
<p>應該再從七星崗江蘇同鄕會談起，不妨假定我們是坐在市區公共汽車裏，於是向南，下着民生路那段旣狹且陡灣這又急的坡，釣魚式翻車一幕往往這裏演出。</p>
<p>民生路舊名，武庫街，現在大可稱為文化街了，大小書店蝐集，新華日報的門市部，在這裏常搬常演活能見度，一個軍官的槍殺案咧，二二二學生大遊行的衝突咧，……若　堂的尖頂敎堂，歷經大轟炸，巍然無恙，依然在度着每個晨昏。</p>
<p>教塲口了，一大片廣塲，平時如上海城隍廟，江湖賣藝，雜要畢陳，小販地攤，呌囂紛呶。一個馬戲團拆去蘆篷之後，大會的主席問題，造成了「事件」，使它馳名全國。</p>
<p>公共汽車在此折而北向，駛上民族路，（關廟街，都郵街，大十字）全城商業的精華所在，它的兩旁商店公司行號櫛比，馬路也寬大平坦。以它為主幹的左右各分支路都很整齊，電影院，川劇塲，京戲館，販店酒樓，像衆星拱月似的羅立。</p>
<p>精神堡壘就是從前的大十字，它比南京新街口廣塲略小，蔣主席曾在這裏接受全市市民的歡呼。現在，這裏每天舉行早晚兩次的國旗升降禮。</p>
<p>中正路的小十字，矗立有一座標準鐘，它報告這銀行區裏的人們以凖確時刻。但有一個時期，它也成為市民諷刺的對象。</p>
<p>銀行區包括陝西街，道門口，打銅街。陝西人的買賣本領，確令人驚佩，遠在若干年前，陝西人即控制了四川的金融，他們留下了這條街，在抗戰期中仍發揮着華爾街的威力。這是財富集中地，無數銀行錢莊公司行號，全國經濟脈搏跳動最敏速的所在。</p>
<p>於是，汽車到了終點站過街樓行人雜沓，但他們要到上淸寺去，他們將順序排成一長列，在迎待一輛輛邊走邊喘氣邊搖頭的公共汽車。人們雖然憎恨交通工具的不健全，人們想到這些「老爺車」也是關山跋涉來自淪陷區任重致遠地在這里苦撐，自會同情它的受難遭際而耐耐耐耐的耐下去。</p>
<p>林森路，南區馬路，府瞰長江，有一個時期行駛過公共汽車，現在祇好步行了，這一佈，有市商會，外交部，中央公園，軍事委員會。再過去中航公司的珊瑚壩飛機塲坐落在江中一片沙洲上。春秋兩季長江水位高漲時，沙洲便不見了，因之，機塲築物都是臨時性的蘆棚。</p>
<p>於是到了半山式的南區公園。</p>
<p>該遺憾的有一件事，南區公園下面至今還很孤寂地躺着成渝鐵路的土方和幾條發銹鐵軌。我們入川八年，我們並未把這條長僅五百餘公里的交通動脈完成。</p>
<p>穿過菜園壩，跳傘塔聳立，不時有輕柔的傘，在大空中裊裊而下，織就大陪都的特殊風情。</p>
<p>望江北，曾家岩；望江南，純陽洞；而望重慶哩，最好的地方，是站在馬鞍山南天門上。</p>
<p>風光無限好，人事變化多。重慶的防空洞你幾曾記得它向我們訴說過多少話語？你又幾曾記得傾呼過我們多少話語！</p>
<p>（卜少夫，卅五年五四前夕，上海）</p>
<p>國民政府還都令</p>
<p>……回念在此八年中，敵寇深入，損失重大，若非依恃我西部廣大之民衆與憑藉其豐沃之地力，保以克奠今日勝利弘基，而四川古稱天府，尤為國力之根源，重慶　帶雙江，控馭南北，占戰略之形勝，故能安度艱危，獲致勝利，其對國家貢獻這偉大，自將永光史册，永不磨滅。……</p>

<p>國府還都紀念特刋之二</p>
<h3>四南京</h3>
<p>在交通部的水陸空三途還都　　不足成五月還都計劃時，航空委員會接到了協助還都的命令，周至柔主任即刻籌派了三十架C－47．C—49兩種運機，每天由京渝對協助還都。在航委會協助空開始時，周主任即告主持空運的部隊長以及渝九龍坡航站京明故宮航站人員云：「在天空，我們是主人，你們不但要使得還都人員得飛行安全，而且要使他們享受做客人的舒適。這樣，我們空軍不僅在戰時馳騁殺敵於第一綫，在和平時亦可服務。」</p>
<p>空軍工作忙</p>
<p>渝九龍坡航站，位於長江岸，距市區約二十分鐘汽車里程。由這里不知來往過多少中外賓客，由空中往來重慶者，都知道水中一塊壩子（珊瑚壩機塲）之外的江岸高處這塊壩子的形象。牠高出江水水面約十公尺，一面是山邱，一面是五十公尺下的渾黃江水，起機於九龍坡機塲的飛機乘客，者有「我由水底昇起來」的輕鬆感覺。</p>
<p>在九龍坡，還都人員港入機塲以後，即在一座有八面窗戶的大客廳休息分組過磅行李，然後點名並指定搭乘機號登機，各人行李過磅後即由航站兵士肩負送往機中，臨上機時　，每人由航委會贈給機中餐合一份，這里面有一小包巧克力　，一包餠干，一小包乾牛肉，一小包　　，可供飛行途中充飢。</p>
<p>在南京，主持這次空運的是張光明隊和工，這人瘦長如同美國明星，加來，古相說東北口音的國語，每天由淸晨到暮時都在無綫電台，明故宮機塲指揮塔以及空運他隊部里用電話佈置指揮他在歸德與日機作戰受過傷在跳傘下降時日機撓撓傘向他射殺，傷愈後曾在新　戌邊三年，愛騎馬行獵，伊犂河岸他騎行十二天不下騎精力如此充沛，去夏勝利後他曾在新疆從事投送空運頗久。是衣復恩大隊長的得力助手。</p>
<p>四月里航委會還都空運雖然京渝天氣時有不測風雲，却從未發生過危險總計二十天中運送了四千多還都人員至京。</p>
<p>通過決議在及南京兩個秀委會無綫電總台是這次還都空運中最忙的單位，在重慶總台機務領班汪仰周使得電機從未出過毛病。兩個航站尤甚忙，明故宮航站楊鍵站長連睡眠時間都減少一半，這些和平時代的忙碌可以鍛煉空軍中小夥子們的負責能力，日後有大部隊空運以及轉移軍力時這鍛煉亦就等於預習。</p>
<p>迎還都人員</p>
<p>馬超　市長八年來跟重慶人一道在渝市過苦日子，他是一位六十左右的老人深知還都者的心境與需要，雖然京地物價低於上海，但法幣的不値錢依然如同當年重慶一般，所以衣食住三項這位南京市主人無法還都人員感到滿意，這個生活與經濟的大問題，似也不應由一個市長解決，要是人人生活富足了，社會經濟有基礎且合乎「民生主義」了，那我們這個國家水凖也就够高了，捨衣食住而外，在市政府範圍內的若干應興應革的市政，確有非常猛進，南京的旅館，到現在房價僅在二千三千，小的旅館一千元一天也很舒適，這是任何一個別的都市所沒有的現象，飲食業方面五百元的客館可以滿足飢餓與　養。交通方面中山路，太平路的萬千路坑已用柏油補好，你乘洋車或騎自行車經過任何一路幹路都可不必繞彎兒避免那彈坑的顚簸，交通工具京市小火車每日往返下關穿過城中心區鼓樓與夫子廟，到中華門外，搭客每天在十萬人以上，可以說是最方便的大衆工具，收費之廉如同長途鐵路　價。水電路電　貴煤　，却也從無停水斷電現象發生，垃圾淸除破壞房屋拆除雖由日　　任，市府一部職員却也出力不少。六十歲的馬市長每天除了戴眼鏡在　公室內批辦公文外，就常乘車東西奔馳到工作地點去自己督導指揮，一個剛到南京的空軍上尉某次不知光華門到大較塲的市郊馬路在翻修，他駕吉普車由城內出光華門赴大較塲，在光華門，一個穿西裝壯實老人搖着紅旗攔住了他的吉普：大聲喊道：</p>
<p>「這條路翻修路面未乾，你走中華門那條路好了。」</p>
<p>後來憲兵告訴他這就是市長，他心中無限欽佩。同是更値得贊佩的是市長督工在二十天內修好大較塲機塲到光華門內的長路，他像打仗，那兒緊急他置身於該地。</p>
<p>南京景色新</p>
<p>在南京，玄武門外的玄武湖是一幅可以與陵園比美的風景畫，南京市園林管理處全部精力就放在玄武湖公園的整理中。不但是善於領略自然美的美國人說玄武湖風景是他們跑遍了地球上那些作戰區域所未發現的湖區，就是享受力被戰爭生活弄麻木了的四川還都人員也讚賞不絕。</p>
<p>玄武湖沿湖的三春花草如今已向夏季行進櫻桃熟了，柳枝茂了，船娘迎客之聲，不絕於耳：「阿要隻小船划划」？</p>
<p>湖上春水盈盈，岸邊綠蘆抽苗正長，戰後麻木的胸襟有湖上三日遊，就凖可恢復原先的性靈。園林管理處為了使湖上飮食供應增多，給遊客以方便。</p>
<p>為了使湖民能以表現首都市民氣槪與涵　，馬市長夫人在湖心公園裏辦了一個補習學樣。馬市長夫人十年來，始終愛從事社會敎育，跟隨她做事的女孩子，不幾年就可成為出色的社會福利或社會敎育的負責者。她做事的要求頗高，隨馬夫的女孩子常云：「夫人雖仁慈，辦事嚴格認眞，簡直像男子。」</p>
<p>自然，在南京迎還都人員的工作，有許多尙待舉辦，但盡了極大的力，却已經顯明。最好的市政，一般人至今推崇第一次歐戰的社會民主黨執政下奧國首都維也納。我相信南京是三民主義新中國的首都，也一定能顧到大衆生活的呼喊與要求，注重生產，節約消耗，更謀求國民生活的蒸蒸日上。（朱民歲，三日）</p>

<p>國府還都紀念刋之二</p>
<h3>京渝上空四小時</h3>
<p>— 本報南京航訊特約記者趙浩生</p>
<p>重慶！向您這八年抗戰聖城揮手吿別請您把一股蓬勃戰鬥精神帶到南京來</p>
<p>參政會閉幕後，重慶是一片還都聲，國民大會的即將召開，更使政治的「候鳥」—訂聞記者們，急待着趕到南京去。中宣部為先後登記的記者們請中航公司撥了一部奪教，在「三兩天就可以走」的情况下，從十一號就開始準備起，直到十六號才得到第二天確實要走的消息。</p>
<p>眞的就這麽離開重慶了，情緒上總感覺到有點倉促，有點茫然。重慶生活，說起來，雖然有點使人惑到厭倦，然而這個與我們八年苦難戰鬥生活密切相連的城市，一旦離去，心情上却實在有說不出的沉重和依戀。</p>
<p>每個離開重慶到「下江」去的人，都曾考慮到兩地物價的比較情形，京滬一帶的物價比重慶高，有些日用品最好在重慶買，但另一種理論是，京滬一帶的物價雖貴，但東西比重慶的好，所以還是到「下邊」買對。這一雙皮鞋，一條毛巾，一兩萬元之間貴賤的衡量，在窮公務員們，也是煞費苦心的。</p>
<h3>向光榮的土地　作一次最親熱吿別式</h3>
<p>為了準備行裝，為了餞別和辭行，整整鬧了好幾大。其實朋友之間，這一別並不嚴重，因為大家都要在最近的十天牛月內離開，在宴會上大家舉箸乾杯，只是互道「南京見！」而已。</p>
<p>十六日下午送行李過磅，一位同業竟穿起五套西服，三件襯衫、兩件大衣，就差沒有打上五條領帶了，其實過磅時侯的情形，並滑有那麽嚴重，因為是大運輸機，載重多，在十五公斤以外，可以容許有一二公斤的伸縮。</p>
<p>當天還有中央黨部的一部專機乘客也在同時過磅，我搭上他們的汽軍回來，車上的一位太太，抱着一個不滿週歲的孩子，因為天氣熱，小孩子混身脫得精光，孩子一團天眞的望着車裏的人笑，那張開的圓圓小嘴裏，已經長出了兩們潔白號亮的小牙齒，可愛的小孩子，會使人禁不住的要去撫措逗弄他，媽媽極歡喜的向大家介紹他呌「小渝」，這是一個富有紀念性的名字，馬上成了大家談話的資料了。媽媽更讓大家米看那小嘴裏面的兩個小牙齒，並且指示着：「他的第三個牙齒已經出頭了。」於是有人說︰「第三個牙，到南京時，就可以長大了。」全車的人都笑起來，「小渝」的第三個牙齒，是代表着多少人的歡喜呵！</p>
<p>臨行的前夜，自己和朋友們都叮　着要早鵫，而臨行的前夜，照例是不容易睡得着的。晚飯後，我為了去通知一位要搭我們的車子赴飛機塲的朋友啟行時間，曾長久的徘徊在林森路上。我珍異的注視着我所踏過的每一段道路，我幾乎想去撫摸那周圍房屋的每一塊磚石。今晚，那最惱人的高坡也變為平坦，最討厭的路邊的汚水，也變碼不那麽刺激人了。從林森路轉向國府路，月光下的國府巍巍殿堂，顯製得雄偉莊嚴，那高簷下的燈光雪亮，門前的巨柱屹然，這使我憶起三個月前政治協商會議開會時，以及一例月前為東北問題在道裏請國的種種「往事」，回憶，並不是一種倒退的感情，記着這許多的演變，用感情去溶化牠，會使你對人生的認認更嚴肅的。繞道上清寺走回報館時，已近十一點了。街上十分冷淸，我慢步在人行道上，用皮鞋使勁的敲打着街路，遠處發着重重的回聲，我要靜靜的再一次的傾聽一下這山城的聲音，我要與這光榮的土地作一次最後的灑熱的吿別。</p>
<h3>飛越三峽上空　俯瞰可愛的蜀江全景</h3>
<p>車子已把我們送到飛機場上等待，十一點半鐘，有飛機來了。大家匆忙的提着行李上飛機。這是C46的大運輸機，我們四十幾個人坐進去．非常寬暢，沒有座位，就在自己的行李上坐下。公司裏的人檢點人數，昨天有一位「商務日報」的記者沒到，當時曾有一位送他太太上飛機的人臨時補上，今天「商務日報」記者來了，而那位臨時補上的先生也上了飛機，因此就多出了一個人來。公司方面要那位臨時補上的先生下來。他請求着，「旣然已經上來了，就通融一下吧！」而且太太和小孩子也要他照應，公司裏的人不答應，最後大家一致的請他考慮到全體的安全問題。他才下去了，他倉卒的和太太分手，小孩子看見爸爸下去，急得哭了。為復員夫妻的暫時分離，是目前後方普遍的悲喜劇，太太能够先走了，實在還是不辛中的幸運者。</p>
<p>飛機許久還沒有開動，金屬的機艙，被烈日晒得火熱。坐在裏面的人像置身在火烤中，有些人因為怕起飛後在高空上冷，穿了很多衣服，更是汗流夾背。</p>
<p>好容易馬達開動了，但在機塲地上繞了一個圈，又轉了回來，機門重新打開，飛機師說潑動機出了毛病。</p>
<p>發動機一直修到兩點鐘還沒有好，再起飛恐怕也只能趕到漢口降落。一位湖北　的同業，已經在準備着到漢口下去了，大家對於可能到武漢觀興，也頗感興趣。到三點鐘修好了，啓行前飛機師宣怖一定可以降落南京。</p>
<p>蔣主席造橡　卽魯遜作</p>
<h3>吳鐵城發表還都感想　重整舊河山　建設新中國</h3>
<p>中央黨部吳秘書長鐵城於上月三十日下午蒞臨本報館參觀時，本報記者曾詢以國府還都感想，吳秘書長首稱：『抗戰勝利，政府還都，為我國歷史上最有意義之一大事，全國人民當亦欣欣鼓舞，深慶河山無恙。然吾人今後建國期間，仍當本戰時戰士流血，人民流汗之吃苦耐勞精神，重整舊河山，建設新中國。本黨政府謀求和平統一團結與還政於民，實行憲政之決心，與人民之迫切渴望者完全相同。』吳秘書長旋又談及離重慶之感想稱：『戰時居住重慶八年，昨晨臨別時，目擊嘉陵美景與山林草木，並念及重太人民之友情，不勝留戀。尤令人難忘者，即在重慶遭遇敵機大轟炸時，渝市民衆，警察，消防隊以及本黨同志所參加之救護隊，在大轟炸中，不顧一切危險，努力工作，彼時且幸賴一般開鑿防空洞之石匠，晝夜辛勤，為减輕人民之損失而努力，迄至勝利以後不久，吾人似猶可開石工之呼喊聲打石聲，與火藥爆炸聲，又重慶附近工廠之工人及四川之農民，戰時渠等在山洞中製造兵器，或在田野增產糧食，對於抗戰之貢獻，均極重要。吾人亦甚為紀念，凡此努力從事抗戰工作之同胞，均足代表我民族祖先披荊斬棘之精神。本此精神，以從事建國工作，相信促成我國之和平統一團結與建設新的中國之任務一定成功。吾人尤應有此信心與毅力。</p>
<p>重慶折　引起的煩惱，被發動機愉快的響聲冲淡了。飛機凌空而上，又把人們帶進惜別的感情裏。飛機在晴朗的天空中行進，每個人都在憑窗向重慶作最後的吿別的張望。</p>
<p>那在萬山中蜿蜒發光的，是嘉陵江，那始終在飛機　下時隱時現的，是長江。公路像一條黃金色沒有盡頭的長帶子，山洞，靑木關，北碚，望去是一個個小黑點。「看呵！看呵！」坐在我旁邊的一個母親，把她的小孩子拖到窗口上來，指點着：「那兒，遠遠的地方，就是重慶，向她揮手！向她說再見呵！」小孩子的大眼睛，被穿口射進來的陽光映照着，越發明亮，烏黑的小眼珠在極智懸的翻動，他驚奮地望着下面，小手在擺，嘴裏應着媽媽的招呼喊着：「Bye!Bye!」</p>
<p>這次是眞的向重慶告別了。重慶，她埋藏着人們多少難忘的記憶。重慶，是一個八年來同我們血肉相連的地方。八年，二千九百多個日子呀！我鈔小生命在這裏誕生，多少孩子在這裏長大了。多少不應該死的親人在這裏死了，多少未曾經歷過的酸甜苦辛，在這裏經歷了。重慶，第一個中國人都會永遠的記得你，都會永無的懷念你重慶！你將在千萬人的記憶中永遠輝煌，重慶！你將同中國勝利的抗戰一樣不朽！</p>
<p>感情隨着發動機的聲音在滾動，隨着天際的流雲在飄蕩，慢慢的，凝成了難以分辨的一片，慢慢的，被淸冽的天風越吹越遙遠了。</p>
<p>飛機在極平穩的行進。在機艙廛有，有的在吃廣柑，有的在看書，有的躺在行李上假寐。記者和一位朋友倚着窗口，等待着看飛機過三峽。</p>
<p>計算着時間，該是到達三峽上空了。氣流開始有了變動，飛機有些顫動。鳥瞰機冀下，是一片重疊更大的高山，長江捲進重山裏，一點也看不見了。所謂有巫山十二峯，大槪就是下面那饅頭樣大的疊疊山頭吧！飛機凌空過三峽，使人感不到「巫山巫峽氣蕭森」的情况，看不見「　府孤城落日斜」的詩景畫面。科學的進步，把人對自然的欣賞範圍也擴大了。杜甫若在，他的「秋興八首」也可以換一個寫法，加添一些新的內容了。</p>
<p>從飛上年地，三峽以內，是與長江相伴着的極規則的山脈。「蜀江水碧蜀山靑」這景象在飛機上也大致可以領略。三峽以外，循着犬江東望，則是一片平野，和茳在這裏似乎掙脫了三峽的羈絆，在平原上作愉快抖摟的嬝繞。除長江以外，這裏同也有了更多交錯的河流和巨湖。整個三峽外的地形，是平曠淡雅，像一個曲綫平柔，薄施脂粉的東方美個的面孔，不若四川地形的山嶺重疊，像西方人鼻高額凸的情况。</p>
<p>三時一刻起飛，到達武漢附近時，太陽已經銜山。夜影慢慢的從窗外飛進公平。機艙裏的電燈開亮。飛機開始夜航了。發動機匀稱而規率的響着。在夜空中依然是在很平穩的行進。</p>
<p>七點二十分鐘，前面駕駛室的門打開了。一個無綫員走出來遞一張條子給大家傳觀：「三十分鐘後到達南京。降落時各就座位勿動。」這時從機窗外射進了月光，憑窗跳望，月亮淸明晶亮，飛機像滑行一片乳色的大海中，眞有「表裏是淸澈」的感覺。偶而還可以看到一點燒山野火的光亮。二十分鐘以後，就有人喊着南京的燈火在望了。</p>
<h3>飛機悄然着陸　看到屹立發光的姿影</h3>
<p>像一個明珠綴成的圖案，像許多從天空上摘下來安植在地上的繁屋，電燈光，構成了一幅四方形的棋盤樣的東西。中間有紅燈織成的綫，想像着那應該是一條係的街道，飛機在上空盤繞，這明珠綴成的圖案在打旋轉，飛機像下樓梯一樣的層層下降，這圖案越來越明亮，越來越放大了。快近機塲上空的時候，飛機冀下在放射着電波信號，發動機左右的燈光也開亮了，在不為人們所感覺的情形中已經着地。</p>
<p>飛機停下來最光打開艙門進來的，是一個穿著號衣的力夫。他以个口南京腔打着招呼，看看錶，正是七點五十分。離重慶四小時零三十五分，聽到南京的聲音了。</p>
<p>提着自己的行李出來，在扶梯上四顧，是片望不到濃際的蒼茫。正在茫然中，忽然聽見一個熟悉的聲音在喊着：「趙大」。我走下來，踏着了南京的土地，握着了朋友的手。我歡喜得要抱着朋友跳起來。我激動得眞要伏下身去親一親這首都的土地！</p>
<p>仍然是操着那一口難解的浙江官話的老祝，告訴我：他已經在飛機塲等了八個鐘頭。坐上他開來的汽車，向城裏駛去，公路眞是想像不到的壞。從大較塲進中葉門，到中華路，我注視着所能看到的每一件事物，街上的行人不多，許多舖上，已經打烊。從中華路到　　路·　　路，是同樣的情形。到中山路已進人市中心區，景象依然是冷淸淸的。南京是比我想像中的荒凉多了。車子經過　街口中心廣塲國父的銅像前，老祝告訴我：蔣主席凱旋南京時經過這裏　曾下車向銅像致敬。　晚，我在黑夜中看到那屹立發光的姿影，中心　起陣極其　穆莊嚴的感情。車子　她而過，我在心靈深處向這象　着無限崇高光輝的銅像歡呼！</p>
<p>就市內和我所見到的許多地方說，南京所給我的感覺，是異常荒凉的。若大的城市，使人感到空洞得　。　晚我在伏案寫稿，中心祈　　　　的人，丟下那一切壞的，　八年來在重慶養成的戰鬥蓬勃的精神　到南京！（五，二）</p>
<h3>國府還都與中國的新生</h3>
<p>— 謝雲翼</p>
<p>經過了八年的長期抗戰，領導這民族的歷史戰爭的蔣主席及國民政府如今凱旋地還都了。這在中國民族的歷史上是怎樣一件饒有意義的盛輻！八年前日寇在東亞的氣燄正高，步步加緊對我們的侵略，企圖消滅我們民族的生存，由征服中國而「大東亞共榮」，而「八纮一字」，以統治整個世界。我們以生產落後的工業，配備落後的軍隊，舉起抗戰的議旗，當時的處境如何艱難；言國內則無重工業的基礎以支持長期的戰事，交通不便，軍運為難，而社會組織又復散漫；言國際，則列强縱有同情的表示，而對日軍火資源的接濟一若戰爭並不存在，或則揚言維護正義，暗與敵寇相勾引，凡此種種，對我獨力抗戰，均為不利。然而我們郤獨力抗拒了日寇的侵略，為時達四年之久；等到日寇陷在中國的泥足愈深，然後有珍珠港的襲擊，太平洋戰事的興起，這纔使我們等到盟邦，由我國獨力抗日到聯合國聯合抗日。如今日寇投降屈伏，領導我們這次民族鬥爭的領袖及政府卻於凱旋聲瓜，還都南京。這在中國民族的歷史上實是一件應該大書特書的盛事。誠如　主席的昭吿，這次中日戰事是中日兩民族國力的總角逐。在這次歷史的鬥爭中，日本是收北了，中國在東亞回　到它應有的地位。以堅定的意志克服諸般困難而終使我們獲得勝利的是我們偉大的領袖，英明的蔣主席，他似是我們民族的救星。如今國府凱旋南京，我們為先要對這位領導我們得獲勝利的蔣主席表示無限的崇敬。對於因這次民族鬥爭而死難的戰士和民衆，緬懷他們死事之烈，我們也由衷表示我們的敬意。這是因為有他們的死，纔有我們的活。</p>
<p>這次中日戰爭淸算了近五十年來日本對我的侵略，重　　　了我國在東亞的領導地位。中國本來是領導東亞的惟一大國，迨日本維新，積極擴張國力，甲子一役，我國領導東亞的地位開始動搖；及日俄戰後，日木儼然為東亞盟主，擠身於列强之林，這是對我侵略，沙步加緊。辛亥革命以後，日本鋻於一個强固統一的中國，和它對於統治征服中國的企圖相衝突，故竭力進行中國的分化運動，與軍閥割據勢力相勾結，企圖阻止中國的强固統一。國民革命的進行，因為日本從中的阻撓，其間遭遇到不少　折。日本是完遂我國國民革命的障碍，囚為國民革命的目的在建立一個强固統一的中國，這與日本的企圖剛相衝突。故當國民革命的武力底定了江南長江流域一帶北上華北的時候，就了所謂「濟南事件」，東北易幟全國統一的時侯，乃有「瀋陽事變」而有「滿洲國」的成立。几此所為，均與中國人民的願望相違。中國為完遂國民革命實行三民主義的建設，非制止日本的侵略不可。而日本為確保其在東亞之領導地位，同時為實現其「八纮一字」的迷夢，勢必征服中國不可。過去五十年來的中日關係，實是一部日本侵略中國史。中日兩民族的總角逐便表現在這次的中日戰爭，由於抗戰的勝利，中國滿　五十年來的恥辱，回復了它過去的光榮。</p>
<p>現在這具有歷史意義的民族鬬爭是光榮地結束了，此後我們踏上建國的大道，中國開始有它的新生。建國固然有多端，如物質建設，心理建設等等，在物質建設之下，還可以有交通建設，生產建設等等，但建國的首要還在建人，國家的新生，還以國民的新生認基礎。國家原本集合無數國民，無數個人而威，建國而不先將個人建立起來有一種新生，則是項建國工作無異在沙灘上起建萵樓大厦，是沒有穩固的基礎的。必個人先有一種新生，然後國家纔有新生，建國纔有磐石的基礎，此所以主席　在其所著的「中國之命運」，論到建國，首及倫理建設，心理建設，我們必須有一種新的精神生活，纔能享受新的物質生活。在日前當國家步人建國階段之際，個人建設實在不容忽視。這次抗戰，我們固然勝利了，但在這次戰爭中，我國一般的國民道德却不知做落了多少。這表現在各方面的事實上；私生活的廢爛，虛偽欺騙與巧取豪奪的相競成風‘貪汚案件的迭出，近日變要加厲，由骯取豪奪竟至變成公然騙取刦奪。凡此種種，都在顯示國民道德的破產。蔣土席為針對時弊，大聲疾呼地提倡新生活運動，呌國民要知禮義，明廉恥，辨是非，然而十年以來，所得的結果如何？我們一追問那個不應該愧對　主席？若以現在這種低落的道德水準，試問我們怎麽能够名實相符的完遂建國大業？面臨着建國的歷史階段，凡我國民實在個個都應該知　義明廉恥，而且「知」與「明」還不够，必須身體力行，革面洗心，個個立定主意，以前「故我」已自作日死，「新我」已自今日生，澈底改革個人的言行，個個對於個人自我有一種新生的覺醒，然後中國民族的新生纔能有　。</p>
<p>國民道德之所以低落，此中原國雖非單純，主要是對於傳統價値的　棄，不自珍惜。辛亥革命雖推翻了數千年來的帝王之治，但推翻數千來我我國民族思想傳統的倒不是辛亥革命，而是辛亥革命後的所謂五四運動，在「打倒孔家店」的呼號下，我國固有的傳統，特別是我國固有的倫理傳統被鄙棄了，以後風氣所演，倫理價值旣失去其標準，個人行為於是便沒有了社會制裁。等到戰事一起，又以戰時生活的艱困，道德水準日趨低落，到了最近，更做每况愈下。為了建國，我們必須制止這種頹風。我們儘管被稱為五强，我們物質生產能力不如人家應該迎頭趕上去，但被稱為有五千年文化歷史的禮義之邦，倘若國民道德長此低落不思振奮，我們何　對向被我們藐視的「蠻野之邦」？在建國的大業上，物質建設，我們固然應該迎頭趕上去，心理建設倫理建設尤應重視，我們要重新建立起道德標準來，必如此，社會秩序纔能維繫，建國努力纔不致浪費。</p>
<p>我們試一看物貿建設達到舊越地位的英美，他們對於精神道德生活如何注重。中報駐紐約特約記者朱家驤在他的通訊裏說：「美國的物資生活總算登峯造極了，尤其這座世界第一大城，紙醉金迷全球獨步，七百多萬居民耳濡目染，聲色的誘惑，物質的追求，其狂烈程度自不消說。可是在這種金錢萬能，物質昌盛的環境下，奇怪，他們仍然注生精神生活，他們仍然追求宗敎安慰，物質滿足了，並不忘記精神，雖有物質生活，還不輕視精神生活，而這點對於他們國家和社會的維繫發展。殊有密切關係。」他又說：「現在我們再要問，他們這樣的宗敎信仰，到底對於他們的世通人心起了什麽作用？這問題當然不易答復……但據多數敎會中人以及公正人士論評，這個國家如果沒有宗敎信仰，那更要人慾橫流，現在就本有這些惟一的社會敎育與訓練機關（…高舉道德之炬，作中流砥柱，這個國家的道德水準，就是這樣在積極如維繫着。譬如以社會風氣說，儘管男女關係隨便，却還有敎會掌握的輿論監督；一個人為想做些事業，而有道德缺憾，這是非常棘手的。…事實上這支宗敎力量確還是這個國家道德力的中堅。他們平日本其宗敎信仰，以完全民主與自由的方式發言，領導羣倫，影響人心，直接左右國家的政策，因亦重大。當此世亂紛紛，美國旣以其精壯物力戰勝了敵人，茲猶欲悲天憫人挽救　　，力樹正義，這種偉大的道德力，我們不能否認他們是主要得力於宗敎。」</p>
<p>回頭看我們中國的情形又是怎樣？我們傳統的道德規律被鄙棄而不加珍惜，美國人的宗敎信仰和宗敎生活，換言之，即美國人的精神生活，我們又不加學習與採行，我們物質生產能力遠不及美國，而我國人物質生活的享受却事事要效法美人。這種，因素交互影響的結果，便是我國民道德的日趨低落，建國大業是物質與精神並重的，我們不能注意於物質建設而忽略了精神建設。精神建設的首要，便在個人澈底革新；有個人的新生，然後纔有民族的新生。</p>

<h3>國府遷都回顧</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>民國二十六年「八一三」抗戰爆發後，保衛淞滬的英勇戰士浴血苦鬥，亙三個月之外，終於因戰略上關係，從上海附近向後撤退。從那時起，敵人就以慘酷殘暴的態勢着着向我首都進逼，不久，戰爭的烽火蔓延到了首都的近郊，但是我政府當局早已抱定抗戰到底的決心，所以從十一月中旬起，國民政府各部院已開始作內遷的準備。爲施政便利起見，國府五院全部遷往重慶，外交部·財政部·衛生署則遷往漢口，交通部遷往長沙，軍事機關則仍留南京。</p>
<p>十一月二十日，國民政府正式發表遷往重慶的宣言。這是一個意義重大的文獻，茲特將全文轉錄於後：</p>
<p>『自蘆溝橋事變發生以來，平津淪陷，戰事蔓延。國民政府鑒於暴日無止境之侵略，爰決定抗戰自衛，全國民衆，敵愾同仇，全體將士忠勇奮發。被侵各省，均有極急劇之奮鬥，極壯烈之犧牲，而淞滬一隅，抗戰亙於三月，各地將士聞義赴難，朝命夕至，其在前綫以血肉之軀築成壕塹，有死無退。暴日傾其海陸空軍之力，連環攻擊，陣地雖化灰燼，軍心的如金石，臨陣之勇，死事之烈，實足昭示民族獨立之精神，而奠定中華復興之基礎。邇者暴日更肆貪黷，分兵西進，逼我首都，察其用意，無非欲挾其暴力，要我爲城下之盟。殊不知我國自決定抗戰自衛之日，即已深知此爲最後關頭，爲國家生命計，爲民族人格計，爲國際正義與世界和平計，皆已無屈服之餘地，凡有血氣，無不具寗爲玉碎不爲瓦全之決心。國民政府茲爲適應戰况，統籌全局長期抗戰起見，本日移駐重慶。此後將以最廣大之規模，從事更持久之戰鬥。以中華人民之衆，土地之廣，人人抱必死之決心，以其熱血與土地，凝結爲一，任何暴力不能使之分離；外得國際之同情，內有民衆之團結，繼續抗戰，必能達到維護國家民族生存獨立之目的。特此宣言，惟共勉之！中華民國二十六年十一月二十日。』</p>
<p>國府遷都宣言發表後第五天，蔣委員長會發表重要談話，要點如次：</p>
<p>『我們堅信公理終必戰勝强權，抗戰到底至最後一寸土與最後一人，這是我們的固定政策。中國擬維持決心抗戰的政策，我們將防衛南京，但在遠處爲之，外人的生命財產當予以保護，外傳南京如有陷於敵手的危險，將付諸一炬之說，僅屬謠言。』</p>
<p>事實上，當遷都宣言發表的時候，政府各機關差不多已經搬運完畢。各項擋案卷宗全部安全遷出；各辦公處和各工廠所有貴重設備，全都拆卸凈盡；醫院，器具，工廠車床，以及各種機械，都已全部移去。南京城只剩了一個空殼。民間情緒頗爲鎭靜，絕無紛亂或慌張的迹象。市民咸具抗戰到底的決心。</p>
<p>從十一月下旬起，政府各部首長如于右任，孫科，王寵惠，孔祥熙，魏道明，段錫朋，黃季陸，戴傳賢，居正等，先後離京，乘輪抵漢，暫留該處。林主席於二十二日乘永綏艦過宜，於二十六日抵達重慶，當時重慶民衆曾舉行盛大歡迎會。蔣委員長仍坐鎭南京，指揮若定。</p>
<p>自國府遷渝後，各國大使特舉行會議，會商使館所在地問題，結果議決暫遷浹口，各使館均以一部份人員留居南京，組織國際委員會，主持保護外僑事宜。於是英，美，法，蘇各國使節，先後到達漢口，在各領館照常辦公。</p>
<p>軍事委員會秘書長張羣，於國府西遷以後，曾招待駐京外僑及外報記者，宜佈南京仍將爲中國首都，民政由市長馬超俊辦理，張氏負責維持治安，決竭力保護外人的生命財產。</p>
<p>外交財政兩部，於二十六日在漢口開始辦公。同時，國府各院部決以五分之一人員入川，文官，參軍，主計三處人員五百餘人，於十一月底到達重慶。遷渝各機關於十二月一日起開始辦公。至此，我國西部重鎭就正式成爲戰時陪都。</p>
<p>但那時政府的民政組織，實際上已趨消滅而代以軍政組織，蔣委員長的大本營，於此形成。各院和各部的人員已减至最少數。爲便於聯絡起見，政府各院部除留在漢口臨時辦公外，並在粵省設立辦事處。但軍事重心已移至湘省，因爲那裏有鐵路公路接通漢口，南昌和粵，桂，滇，黔四省，因此湘省已成爲我國長期抗戰的根據地。</p>
<p>十二月下旬，戰火向西蔓延，漢口積極備戰，駐漢各政府機關在必要時繼續內遷。內政，外交，財政，實業各部臨時辦公處遷往重慶，軍政，鐵路，交通，敎育各部，則暫移長沙，不久亦遷往重慶。</p>
<p>在中國抗戰史上佔着重要一頁的國府遷都重慶，至此已吿完成。</p>
<h3>凱旋南京記　國府還都的新頁</h3>
<p>— 本報次料室</p>
<p>在原子炸彈降臨日本廣島，三十四年八月九日的蘇聯參戰，以及中國的英勇抗戰之下，日皇終於在八月十五日，宣佈日本無條件投降。抗戰勝利消息傳到了流亡八年的陪都官民的耳中時，每個人心中激起了歸思的波浪，整個重慶陷入了準備復員的狂潮中。</p>
<p>在日寇投降後第三天，中央社首先發出中國政府發言人對記者團透露國民政府預定於最短期內還都南京的消息。九月中旬，當局命令各機關作還都之準備。十二月初，行政院特派陳參事前往南京勘察各部會房屋傢具和各部會人員到京後的食宿問題，此行結果，決定行政院暫假舊鐵道部辦公，各部會多數仍在原址辦公。</p>
<p>同時，行政院依據最高當局的指示，決定了政府人員還都的具體辦法：（一）行政院和所屬各部會依照實際需要，派遣一部份人員赴京，各部會人數不等，最多的如財政·交通等部，爲一百五十人，最少的如僑委會等祇有十人，總數共一千五百人。（二）限十二月十五日以前，一律到達南京。（三）行政院例會，移南京舉行。</p>
<p>從十二月五日起，政府各機關還都人員，開始和中國戰時陪都吿別，踏上凱旋的歸途，重返闊別八載的首都。他們分水陸空三路進發。重慶與京滬間的航空班機，爲了趕運首批還都人員，特地將客運停辦十天。第一批還都人員，（包括行政院各機關人員），一百五十人，於十二日首先飛抵南京，司法行政部職員六十人，於十三日接踵到達南京。另有行政院首批還都人員四百人，搭乘華源輸沿江東下，直達首都。外交部職員六十人則於十四日分搭飛機及輪船赴京。第一批行政院各機關還都人員，於十五日已全部到齊，十七日起開始正式辦公。敎育部人員六十餘人，於二十日左右抵京。此後政府各機關人員陸續離渝赴京，一時京渝道上，冠蓋如　，洋溢着蓬勃的氣象。到二月初，還都人員已達一千餘人。</p>
<p>但是據有關方面估計：留渝的中央機關，應隨同政府還都的公敎人員及其家屬人數，常在四十三萬以上。於是還都工作遇到了兩大難關：第一是運輸困難，水陸空運量未能配合實際需要。據運輸主管方面報吿：三月份運輸數量，全國各綫，空運方面，共運出一萬人，其中到達上海·南京約計四千五百人。陸路分南北兩綫，南綫到長沙，北綫到寳鷄，再分別轉京，乘客可達二萬人。水運方面，因未能直達漢口，宜渝段的運送八千四百人。照此運輸能率，如以四十萬人計，一年後方能遝送完畢。當局除加强空運力量外，對於機位的分配不得不加以限制，對於國民大會代表及參政員約一千人及中央黨政各機關還都人員四千二百人，決定儘先空運，其機位分配情形如下：中央黨部五百人，國防最高委員會一百人，國府文官主計兩處共二百八十人，國府參軍處一百二十人，靑年團二百人，立法院六百人，司法院一百二十人，考試院二百五十人，監察院一百二十人，行政院所屬秘書處·外交·財政·經濟·交通·農林·糧食等部，共一千七百人，外交使館人員，其餘普通還都人員，不免略受限制。</p>
<p>還都第二難關，是還都人員的住屋問題。據粗略估計：在南京的政府機關辦公房屋和公務人員的眷屬住所，約計缺少二萬八千棟。政府爲求補救，已令聯合國善後救濟總署撥借七十億元作建築房屋之用。此外，政府並向美國訂購活動房屋一千七百棟。在活動房屋未曾全部運到以前，各機關在京辦公房屋，由各機關自理，職員眷屬暫行留渝，如須先行赴京者，所需房屋應自行辦理。</p>
<p>二月下旬，國防最高委員會通過「中央黨政機關由重慶還都辦法」，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（甲）政府各機關還都人員之規定：（一）員工名額，以在職爲限，並不能超過本年度預算人數。（二）員工眷屬以配偶及直系親屬爲限。（三）員工眷屬平均每職員携帶三人，每工役携帶一人。（四）各機關在渝死亡之公務員，其眷屬未在其他機關任職須還都者，由本服務機關辦理還都手續。</p>
<p>（乙）公物之規定：各機關公物自行辦理，以每職員一人配帶一百公斤爲限。</p>
<p>（丙）員工行李之規定：職員曁眷屬每人以百公斤，工役曁眷屬每人以五十公斤爲限。</p>
<p>（丁）經費預算：（一）由渝赴京人員上下碼頭及沿途之車船費，按實計算，由各機關自行統籌辦理。（二）輪船票費暨膳費，每人平均按十二萬元計。（三）每百公斤二萬元計算。（四）公私物品由渝運京，一切費用在內，每噸按十五萬元計算。（五）各機關還都後之購置設備費，按每職員十萬每工役三萬元計算。</p>
<p>（戊）員工還都補助費之規定：（一）每人特級四十萬，元簡任級卅五萬元，薦任級卅萬元，委任級廿五萬元，雇員十五萬元。工役每人八萬元。各機關雇員工役如不隨同還都者，各發給三個月遺散費。</p>
<p>（己）重慶以外之中央機關遷還首都，及由重慶遷駐首都以外各地之中央機關，均比照此項規定辦法辦理。</p>
<p>至此，國府還都事宜進人了具體實現階段。</p>
<h3>還都高潮期</h3>
<p>國府還都實踐階段，嚴格的看起來，是從四月二十五日開始的。行政院工作人員，大部份均已抵這南京，各院部會各機關還都人數，已達三分之二，並已開始在京辦公。</p>
<p>自日本投降八月來，在京僅屬收發性質之院部會辦事處，至四月二十五日起，即完全改觀，而成爲軍政之神經中樞。非僅政府官吏，日來加緊其還都之空中旅行，即各黨派領袖，，現亦均作來京之準備。</p>
<p>國府汕彩輝煌，業已修葺一新。國府修建工程，共分三部份：其第一部份辦公大樓，包括主席室·文官室·即日可以竣工。第二部份圖書大樓，包括政務官懲戒委會辦公室，圖書館及第三部份印鑄局與印鑄工廠等，四月底修理完畢。國府府址在淪陷時間曾先後爲僞維新政府，偽行政院，僞監察院，偽立法院，僞考試院，僞銓叙部等佔用，飯廳一所已毀於火，，全部房舍，八年來迄未加修，致屋頂茨草叢生，逢雨輒漏，今則整修，漸復舊觀矣（按：國府組織：文官處，下設政務局（去年十月初增設），印鑄局·文書局·人事室。參軍處，下設軍務局（去年十月初增設）。總務局·典禮局。主計處，下設會計局·統計局·歲計局，另二獨立直屬機構：（政務官　戒委員會與稽　委員會）。</p>
<p>還都工作一天緊張一天，在四月二十日左右，政府各輩位已經赴京人員，平均二分之一。行政院廿五日起開始辦公，各機關則廿八日起開始辦公。</p>
<p>在還都匆忙進行中最令人感奮的一個消息，便是領導全國民衆英勇抗戰的　蔣主席最近即將榮歸首都，主持還都事宜。陪都市民對於　蔣主席領導抗戰，獲致最後勝利，和八年來愛護市民的德意，倍切依依之情，特由各界發起舉行空前盛大的惜別大會，表示隆重歡送，並請　主席對市民訓話，以留永久紀念。同時，並由市府設計，在朝天門沚嘴至民生公司地段，闢一偉大公園，內建　主席銅像，以紀念　主席在渝領導全國抗戰的豐功偉績。</p>
<p>四月三十日國民政府頒佈了還都令如下：</p>
<p>『國民政府前爲持久抗戰，於廿六年十一月移都重慶，八年以來，幸賴我忠勇將士前仆後繼，壯烈犧牲，全國官民，含辛茹苦，堅靱奮鬥，與夫同盟各國海空齊進，比肩作戰，卒使敵寇降伏，膚功克奏，茲者國土重光，金甌無缺，抗戰之任雖終，建國之責加重，政府爰定於本年五月五日凱旋南京，以慰衆望，唯是大戰之後，民生艱困，國力凋敝，亟宜與民休息，恢復元氣，努力建設，保持戰果。所望全國軍民，同心一德，朝乾夕惕，庶不負抗戰建國之初衷，實現三民主義之使命。回念在此八年中，敵寇深人，損失重大，若非依恃我西部廣大之民衆，與憑藉其鹽沃之地方，何以克奠今日勝利弘基？而四川古稱天府，尤爲國力之根源，重慶襟帶雙江，控馭南北，占戰略之形勝，故能安度艱危，獲致勝利。其對國家貢獻之偉大，自將永光史册，永不磨滅，當茲還都伊邇，鍾陵在望，緬維兩京收復之艱難，更覺巴蜀關係之重要。政府前於廿九年九月明令定重慶爲陪都，近更以四川爲全國建設實騐區，應即採其體制，崇其名實，着由行政院督同各該省市政府，妥爲規劃，積極進行，使全川永定爲國家之重心，而樹全國建設之楷模，有厚望焉。此令。』</p>
<p>與國民政府頒佈「還都令」同時，馬歇爾特使搭專機啓程赴京，馬歇爾特使在京深居簡出，與幕僚硏議各方情報。中共代表周恩來等，定三日來京。隨員及電訊人員等二日午後先來，佈置一切。民主同盟代表或將於五日來京，亦已派人來京尋覓辦公及居住之房屋。馬帥對在渝談判未獲結果，雖曾表示遺憾，然對前途之困難仍有克服之信心。</p>
<p>今天，全國官民懷着奏凱的熱烈的情緒，慶祝着抗戰勝利後的還都大典—和平統一民主强盛的新中國的奠基典禮。（心堂）</p>
<p>首都各界慶祝國府還都彩牌樓在趕紮中</p>
<h3>還都挿曲</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>隨着抗戰的勝利，還都問題立即被人們所注視，並認爲今後建國工作發展上的前提之一。到了去年十二月，陪都及北平等地，就喧傳着還都北平的空氣。事實上，不僅是空氣而已，而且有若干事實足資佐證：</p>
<p>（一）去年十二月十五日中央社電稱：北平市商會整理委員會有呈　蔣主席請遷都北平之舉。</p>
<p>（二）華北宣慰大員張繼，在招待新聞記者會上，主張建都北平，並且希望新聞界多多宣傳。</p>
<p>（三）據去年十二月二十日聯合社重慶電稱：政府領袖最近會非正式舉行投票，結果贊成建都北平者，佔百分之九十二，全國各地贊成建都北平之情緒，亦甚爲熱烈。</p>
<p>（四）據南京某軍政大員談稱：蔣主席巡視收復區返渝後，對北平印象很好，而盟邦人士對該地尤感興趣。馬歇爾特使幹旋國共糾紛，倘獲成功國內問題當可解決，果爾，則建都北平或即將實現。</p>
<p>（五）今年四月一日，參政會舉行第十九次會議時，參政員何基鴻，王普涵等，提請政府明令定都北平，經決議通過，送請政府採擇施行。</p>
<p>（六）北平市長熊斌，曾非正式對記者稱：北平有十分之七希望，可能成爲中國未來國都。</p>
<p>（七）同時，美國方面對於中國將政治中心移往北平一事，亦深感興趣。他們覺得天津日人所築新港完成後，平津之於中國，正與華盛頓紐約之於美國的情勢，極爲相似。</p>
<p>在這種種期望和鼓吹之下，於是奠都北平的空氣日漸濃厚起來，而變成若有其事似的。可是，我們始終沒有聽見政府方面對於此事有過正式的宣佈。反之，政府發言人張平羣曾吿訴記者說：外間一再謠傳政府，現在有北平考慮建都之說，絕非事實。同時，宣傳部長吳國楨亦曾答復外籍記者的問話稱：現在我國國都決仍爲南京，所傳目前又有考慮將北平定爲國都之說，未有所聞。</p>
<p>其後，東北風雲日趨緊急，喧傳一時的遷都北平之說，就此沉寂下來。同時，政府在決定還都南京以後，竭力加强還都準備，以事實來證明了過去的「遷都北平說」之不可靠。這只可說是國府還都問中一個的題揷曲吧了。</p>

<h3>Grand Ceremony for the Return to the Capital Solemnly Held; Chairman Chiang Leads All in Paying Respects at the Mausoleum; All Circles in the Capital Celebrate and Present Embroidered Banners</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The grand ceremony for the triumphant return of the National Government to the capital and the anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Government will be held jointly at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 5th.

<h3>Marshall and Zhou Enlai Met and Talked Yesterday; Xu Yongchang Flew from Chongqing to the Capital; The Three-Man Group Meeting is Expected to Resume Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, went to the official residence of Special Envoy Marshall at 5 Haining Road at 10:00 AM on the 4th for his first visit after arriving in the capital. The talks lasted for about an hour. According to Zhou's remarks to reporters this morning, the CCP still strongly emphasizes the conflict in central Hubei. According to our reporter's investigation, the war in central Hubei is not as serious as reported because the National Army is only taking defensive measures and being forced to fight without taking the offensive. It is expected that the war in the area will cease within days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] General Xu Yongchang, the government representative to the Military Three-Man Group, arrived in the capital by special plane from Chongqing at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. He told our reporter that the government intends to hold talks on reopening the Northeast negotiations after receiving a reply from the CCP. It is rumored that Chairman Chiang will meet with General Xu Yongchang on the evening of the 4th. According to well-informed sources, if the CCP can sincerely accept Special Envoy Marshall's advice, order the Communist forces in the Northeast to withdraw from Weichun, and release the government officials and Chinese and foreign reporters detained by the Communist forces in Changchun, the Three-Man Group meeting is expected to resume next week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai on the 4th to continue discussing the Northeast ceasefire issue, lasting about an hour and a half. This was the first meeting between Marshall and Zhou in the capital. Government representative Xu Yongchang arrived in the capital from Chongqing today and will also attend the next meeting. There was no progress reported in today's talks. Zhou Enlai proposed sending a thirty-person group to central China to implement a ceasefire. The Northeast issue remains deadlocked because the government declared that the Communist forces must first hand over Changchun before an agreement can be reached. If both sides insist on their own views, it will endanger national peace.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 4th] General Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, received reporters today and made remarks, saying in brief: The negotiations on the ceasefire in the Nine Eastern Provinces were recently held in Chongqing, but ended in failure. The biggest reason for this was that the Kuomintang insisted that the government forces occupy Changchun before signing the ceasefire agreement, a condition that could not be accepted by the CCP. Negotiations will continue in the capital in the future. The main goal of my visit to Beijing this time is the situation in Hubei. Zhou confirmed that the Communist army has occupied the two major cities of Harbin and Qiqihar in northern East Nine Provinces, and the areas on both sides of the Suifenhe to Manchuria railway have established people's governments. However, Zhou could not point out the position of the troops along the railway line, because most of them are irregular troops. Zhou also confirmed that the issue of stationing US Marines in North China was raised in recent negotiations, but he refused to announce any details. Zhou also refused to comment on whether a reply had been received regarding the CCP's protest to the United States against the United States helping China transport troops to the East Nine Provinces. He only said: The situation has changed slightly, that is, the previous US military transport of Chinese troops was for the purpose of recovering sovereignty in the East Nine Provinces, and at this moment they are transporting troops engaged in civil war. Zhou continued: I am convinced that the US government and people have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. President Truman has already provided assurances on this point. The Chinese Communist Party supports American-style democracy and the government principles put forward by President Lincoln, that is, the principle of democracy and ownership by the people, which is more supportive than the Soviet system. If the Kuomintang suspects the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union, then they should also suspect the relationship between the CCP and the United States. The CCP demands democracy in the East Nine Provinces. The CCP has no intention of monopolizing the East Nine Provinces, nor does it agree that the East Nine Provinces should be ruled by one party. In the future, after the reorganization of the central government and the establishment of a coalition cabinet of all parties, the East Nine Provinces should be jointly managed by the Kuomintang, the Chinese Communist Party, and representatives of the local people. In terms of foreign relations, we do not agree that the East Nine Provinces should become a base against the Soviet Union, nor do we agree to discriminatory treatment against Americans. What we need is only international cooperation. The rumor that the CCP has answered and signed twelve treaties with the Soviet Union is not true. The CCP has never signed a treaty with any foreign country on behalf of China.</p>
<h3>Tang Dynasty Statues Collected by the Northwest Expedition Team and Stored in Hankou were Destroyed by the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] The hundreds of boxes of antiques collected in the Northwest by the former Northwest Scientific Expedition Team included twenty-seven boxes containing Tang Dynasty statues, which were shipped to Hankou before the war and stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse. Later, when Wuhan fell, they were entrusted to the American side for storage in the British-owned Longmao Bank. When the Pacific War broke out, the enemy stole these antiques and moved them to the puppet Zhongjiang Bank. Now the Ministry of Education has sent personnel to Hankou to search for them, and it has been found that the antiques have been damaged beyond recognition. The Tang Dynasty statues were extremely valuable in the study of Buddhist culture, and now they have suffered such damage, which is a great loss to our culture.</p>

Peking University alumni also gathered for dinner at the Sand Beach Red Building, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, tonight. Fu Sinian specially rushed from Chongqing to participate. Many of them were those who personally participated in the movement that year. The excitement and joy of this place and these people can be imagined. The Beiping Branch of the Chinese Cultural Association originally planned to hold a commemorative evening at the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University tonight, but someone temporarily reported that "the elements were complicated," causing Fu Jen to refuse to lend it. The association specially published a detailed explanation in the newspaper today, expressing "regret" and suspending it. The reporter met Cao Rulin, a person involved in the May Fourth Movement, today. This over-seventy-year-old director-general spoke with emotion when talking about the past. He said that what the students opposed at that time was the Beiyang government, not individuals, and he was only taking the brunt as a foreign eunuch. He said that he was indeed a supporter of Sino-Japanese friendship, but he did not agree with aggression. He admitted that most of the 100 million yuan in foreign debt borrowed at that time was squandered by the Beiyang government and not used for construction. He said that he was honored to be able to witness China's victory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] All circles in Beiping City held a May Fourth Commemorative Conference in the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 10:30 this morning.

According to Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, the exact date of the opening of the National Assembly is still difficult to predict. It must wait until the domestic situation is stable and various issues are resolved reasonably before it can be convened. Judging from the current situation, it would be more appropriate to hold the conference in the autumn of this year.</p>

It is reported that the Communist army guarding Sipingjie has laid landmines all over the city. There are obstacles such as barbed wire nearby, as well as steel-concrete bunkers and gun emplacements or equipped with artillery, all of which are their unmentionable gains.

(1) Reinstatement is divided into transfer and further education. (2) Re-employment is divided into career change and job seeking. (3) Staying in the military means being willing to be a career officer and serving in the division for another year before being sent to various military officer schools. (4) Returning to their hometowns means not being willing to return to school or re-employment. The central government has appropriate measures for the future of Youth Army students. There is also a Youth Middle School that will be ordered to be established soon, divided into high and junior high schools, with 30 classes planned, each with 50 students. In the future, the organizational structure of the Youth Army will be changed to a cadre training division, which will not belong to the National Army and will specialize in military training for students above high school.</p>
<h3>Conflict at the Junction of Henan and Hubei Provinces: The Military Mediation Department Consults All Day; Task Force to Yongnian Scheduled to Depart Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Military Mediation Department consulted all day yesterday on the issue of conflict between the Nationalist and Communist armies in the eastern border area of Henan and Hubei. The CCP demanded the immediate dispatch of two additional task forces to investigate and mediate, otherwise, it asserted, a full-scale conflict would inevitably erupt, rendering all the efforts of the Mediation Department futile. As a result of the consultations, it was agreed in principle to send a task force. Simultaneously, it is reported that the government side proposed sending additional task forces to Gaomi, Nantong, and eastern Rehe. The eastern Rehe issue stemmed from recent troop movements by the Communist army in that area toward the Northeast. This issue was also agreed upon in principle by all three parties for dispatch of a task force for investigation and mediation, but no concrete decisions were made. Following the plane crash of the task force sent to Yongnian, the government has dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaoshu as a replacement, and the U.S. side has replaced its representative with O'Rosson. They are scheduled to depart on the 6th. After the detention of CCP personnel in Shijiazhuang, leading to their collective return to Beiping in anger, the Military Mediation Department has cabled its U.S. representative in the task force to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Guangshan Task Force of the Executive Headquarters is scheduled to depart from Beiping for Guangshan on the 5th. The leader from the government side is Colonel Chen.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The representatives of the three parties of the Jinan Executive Task Force flew to Qingdao yesterday and then proceeded to Gaomi. It is reported that the mission, in addition to conducting on-the-ground investigations into the truth of the conflicts in the Jiaodong area and engaging in mediation, also plans to put forward discussions on the restoration of railway repairs on the various lines in Shandong Province that are currently suspended. Military sources also report that at 10 PM on May 1st, the Communist army in Zhangqiu launched a second surprise attack on Mingshui, which was repelled.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The Propaganda Bureau Office in Beiping issued a public statement today, stating that within Shandong Province alone, there are more than 260,000 Communist troops actively engaged in protecting ports leading to the Northeast and blockading transportation lines to prevent Nationalist troops from advancing. It is reported that hundreds of Japanese technicians are currently serving the Communist Party. The large Communist presence in Shandong serves three main purposes: (1) to maintain control over the large areas already occupied, (2) to protect ports for transporting troops to the Northeast, and (3) to disrupt the Jiaoji Railway, preventing Nationalist troops from gaining communication.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 4th] The entire First Battalion of Yang Guofu's Communist army in Shouguang County, Shandong Province, recognizing that the actions of the Communist army were mostly detrimental to the country and the people, and that they were now being transferred to the Northeast to incite civil war, merely serving as expendable pawns, resolutely defected to the Nationalist army on the 10th of last month, bringing all their weapons with them.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The National Government Returns to the Capital</h3>
<p>This morning, the National Government will hold a grand ceremony for its return to the capital. Central authorities and representatives from all sectors of the Nanjing municipality will gather solemnly before the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation to celebrate the victorious return of the National Government. We are filled with immense joy at this grand occasion. However, recalling the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders when they entered the capital in December of the 26th year of the Republic, recalling the suffering of the people during the eight years of bloody war, whether they were displaced with the army, wandering and destitute, or subjected to enemy rule, groaning in misery, today, nine months after the victory, the government has announced its return to the capital, truly a case of "thinking about the pain after it subsides." Amidst our joyful excitement, we have countless thoughts.</p>
<p>First, we are delighted that Chairman Chiang's spirit and health remain as strong as ever. Chairman Chiang led the nation's military and people through eight years of struggle, and has already won victory. We are even more confident that Chairman Chiang will lead the nation to continue the struggle and win lasting peace – peace for the nation and peace for the world. "Peace, struggle, save China," these were the last words of the Father of the Nation, and we will never forget them. Today, Chairman Chiang leads civil and military officials in offering sacrifices at the mausoleum, and will surely fulfill his last will and testament, comforting the spirit of the Father of the Nation. "Peace, unification, democracy, unity," are the common aspirations of the entire nation, and we must, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, proceed with sincerity towards this clear goal. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang was responsible for countless matters. Military, diplomatic, political, and economic affairs were all concentrated in one person, resolving major doubts and deciding major policies. Ultimately, he led the country through storms and waves to the shore of victory. His graying hair is proof of his diligence and concern. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, at the age of sixty, remains vigorous in spirit, surpassing even the young. Before returning to the capital, Chairman Chiang first flew to Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai to comfort the people in the occupied areas. Recently, he flew to Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei for inspections, and especially expressed deep regret at parting with Sichuan, which had served as the wartime capital. He traveled tirelessly, barely having time to rest. Chairman Chiang's spirit is a sign of the bright future of the nation. We respect Chairman Chiang, and whether officials or ordinary people, we must all serve the country according to our abilities, fulfilling our responsibilities, and not burdening Chairman Chiang with trivial matters. We must allow Chairman Chiang more time and energy to preside over the major plans of the nation; this is how we can show our love for Chairman Chiang and our care for the nation.</p>
<p>Second, we urge all parties concerned with national affairs to jointly fulfill their promises. The return of the National Government to the capital should be the beginning of peaceful national reconstruction. However, the peace and nation-building program of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the military reorganization and unification plan, the ceasefire order, and the agreed-upon matters, this entire set of resolutions related to peace, has not seen genuine implementation in the past three or four months. The four promises announced by Chairman Chiang on the opening day of the PCC have already been realized one by one, but the other promises that should be mutually upheld by all parties have been delayed and evaded. Contemporary commentators on the CCP's approach to the current situation say that they aim to achieve "everything as a process, with no conclusion." Perhaps the Communist Party's brilliance lies in this "no conclusion" aspect. The reduction of the military should be a conclusion, but regarding how to unify the reorganized forces, and how to compile a list of names before unification, they have presented many processes, and the unification has been put on hold. The ceasefire should be a conclusion, but regarding how to mediate, and how task forces should implement the agreements, one party is mediating, while the other is provoking, leading to the ceasefire ultimately lingering in the process. Reorganizing the National Government and convening the National Assembly to draft a constitution should be a conclusion, but disputes over the number of seats and the failure to provide lists of representatives have stalled the reorganization of the National Government and delayed the convening of the National Assembly, leaving these two major events in a state of process. As for the Northeast problem, it was originally not a problem. With the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the central government taking over, it was perfectly legitimate and there should have been no disagreement. However, suddenly there was a so-called "Democratic Allied Army," and suddenly there was the siege of Changchun, so taking over the Northeast also became a twisted process. Such acts of bad faith are extremely frustrating. We believe that if all parties concerned with national affairs truly want the country to embark on the path of peace, unification, democracy, and unity, they must all show conscience and jointly fulfill all promises. The people will not tolerate any party playing the "process" game again, always avoiding the practical implementation of a "conclusion."</p>
<p>Third, we hope that the government will have the courage to reflect on itself and start anew with the people. Looking back at the Japanese invasion, the main reason was our own self-disrespect. More than twenty years after the founding of the Republic, we wasted time and achieved nothing. "Carelessly hiding, teaching theft," led to the Japanese wolfish ambition to nibble and devour. Now, with great difficulty, thanks to the bloodshed and sweat of the military and people of the whole country, and the joint assistance of allied nations, we have achieved final victory. We must not forget the pain before it has subsided, and everyone must quickly enjoy the blessings. Especially the government authorities, who need to lead the entire people to thoroughly correct past mistakes. "Comfort and ease are poisonous," as the ancient saying goes. Moreover, with the global food shortage, national famine, people struggling to survive, a powerful neighbor approaching, unsecured borders, and fifth columns active everywhere, the internal and external troubles facing our country are no less severe than before the War of Resistance. How can we afford to be complacent? The National Government, returning to the capital at this moment, should announce to all officials and start anew with the people. Save all wasteful expenses, cut all redundant personnel, abolish outdated laws like fur, abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that harm the people's livelihood, rectify official conduct, and enforce discipline, truly achieving "what the people like, like; what the people hate, hate." The Chinese people are the most docile and easiest to govern in the world. As long as the government does less to disturb the people, and officials come up with fewer ideas to disturb the people, the people will already benefit greatly, praising "virtuous governance" and spreading good words everywhere. We sincerely support the government, and we sincerely love our leader. We are not afraid of foreign aggression, nor are we afraid of internal rebellion. What we are most concerned about, however, is the rampant corruption of officials and the prevalence of slackness in the government! We believe that the key to governance today is to eradicate corruption. The way to eradicate corruption is to face reality and first repent of the past mistake of neglecting the treatment of officers and soldiers and public education personnel, and correct it from the beginning. The government not only needs to repent for this, but also needs to have the courage to change its ways, take responsibility, and find ways to improve their treatment. The government should be determined, make bold moves, and rather postpone all "new policies" and first concentrate its efforts on stabilizing prices; rather save other government expenses and first and foremost try to increase the salaries and benefits of soldiers, officers, and public education personnel. Just think: if we truly want to build a modern nation, how can we have any hope if officers and soldiers are not fed, public servants are not fed, and school teachers are not fed! The government's responsibility is to plan for the whole people to have enough to eat and wear. The food problem of soldiers, officers, and public education personnel is the first problem that the government should be responsible for. Otherwise, how can we eliminate corruption and work seriously? We believe that the National Government after returning to the capital must be a government that faces reality and starts anew with the people.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Deadlock Difficult to Break: Differences Deepen Among the Four Powers; Discussion of the Southern Italian Border Issue Again Yields No Result Yesterday; Peace Conference Likely to Be Delayed Indefinitely</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, May 5th Radio: The four foreign ministers held another meeting today to discuss the border issue between Yugoslavia and Italy. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed opposition to the border between southern Italy and Yugoslavia suggested by the British and American foreign ministers. It is said that the British and American suggestions are tantamount to punishing Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was an ally of the United Nations during the war, and it is unfair to punish it now. The foreign ministers discussed for a long time, but still no results were achieved.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] The foreign ministers' conference has so far failed to reach a consensus on major issues. Today's meeting discussed the abolition of border fortifications in Italy and other relatively simple issues related to treaties signed by Italy with various countries before the war. It is said that whether the fortifications bordering Italy with France and Yugoslavia will be abolished will be decided by the foreign ministers' conference. Treaties previously concluded by Italy with other countries will also be submitted for discussion to see if any of them can be retained. Today's meeting was filled with pessimism, partly because there is no hope of resolving the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia. In addition, the handling of Italian territories and the issue of reparations are also difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The four foreign ministers' conference continued to meet at the Luxembourg Palace today. Regarding the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, the representatives of the two countries clashed in their opinions. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi claimed to speak on behalf of a new, peace-loving Italy and asked the foreign ministers' conference to define the border between Italy and Yugoslavia based on the old "Wilson Line," with the port of Trieste belonging to Italy. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kartelj accompanied by Foreign Minister Simic and seven advisors attended the meeting and spoke for three and a half hours, insisting that Trieste and most of the Istrian Peninsula should be assigned to Yugoslavia. It is rumored that Kartelj almost demanded that the entire Istrian Peninsula on the Adriatic Sea and Trieste should all belong to Yugoslavia. At the same time, Italy insisted that the port and part of its hinterland should still belong to Italy. The foreign ministers' conference will hold an informal meeting tomorrow to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd, United Press] According to official sources, the four foreign ministers may pack up and return home without reaching any major agreements in public discussions. After a week of fruitless consultations, the differences between the Soviet Union and Western European countries have only intensified. If no agreement is reached on the draft peace treaty, the peace conference originally scheduled to be held on May 1st will be delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd, United Press] TASS Paris reported that Bernas's suggestion to end the occupation of Germany is actually giving the Soviet Union another pile of waste paper, just as the current British government is also turning the Anglo-Soviet alliance into waste paper.</p>
<p>, unexpectedly, at approximately 1:00 AM on May 1st, soldiers, incited by Liu, rose up and demanded three months of back pay from Team Leader Su. When Su was responding tactfully, he was suddenly shot and killed on the spot by a soldier. Liu Jiyuan then led the soldiers to loot houses, lasting for three hours. The entire team of more than one hundred soldiers fled east by sea with Liu. It was discovered that 700 zuzu of rice and countless properties were lost. At 7:00 AM on the same morning, Zhaopu District Chief Qi Zhihong personally reported to the county government. Subsequently, a meeting was held with the Provisional Senate and the county party headquarters to send personnel to Zhaopu to comfort the people and investigate the truth. According to a reporter familiar with the inside story, the cause of the disaster was indeed the failure to pay three months of back pay. The government suddenly changed personnel without preparation, leading to this major disaster.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. State Department and the Iranian Embassy have both received official reports confirming that Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from Iran, except for the northern province of Azerbaijan, and will withdraw from Azerbaijan by Monday. News from Iran has led the State Department and Iranian Ambassador Arale to believe that the Soviet Union will fulfill its promise to withdraw from Iran by May 6th, so the Security Council may end the Iranian issue next week. Various sources reveal that Soviet troops withdrew from Greater Tabriz this week.</p>
<h3>Cosmic Ray Bomb: 100 Million Times More Powerful Than Atomic Bomb</h3>

<h3>After the Publication of the Palestine Report, Arab National Sentiment Is Enraged; Al Arabim Warns Britain and the U.S. to Handle Matters in the Holy Land with Caution; General Strike in the Holy Land Fortunately Shows No Incidents</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] Al Arab League Secretary-General Al Arabim issued a warning statement yesterday, saying that after the publication of the report by the British and American investigation team, many Arab people have suggested launching a holy war in Palestine and evacuating Arab women and children within the territory. This suggestion has serious consequences, as can be seen from the discussion. It is hoped that Britain will reject the suggestions in the report, especially the points about Jewish immigration and allowing Jews to buy land. The United States, being in a distant land, is naturally easy to make suggestions, but before making suggestions, it should first weigh the seriousness of the consequences.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 4th] Yesterday's general strike by the Arab people, except near the Damascus Memorial Gate, where the military police dispersed a large number of demonstrating people, had no other incidents.</p>
<p>Will Submit to Security Council If Necessary</p>

<h3>Soviet Bond Issue: 20 Billion Rubles to Revive the Economy</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] Moscow Radio broadcast today: The Soviet government is issuing public bonds to its citizens worth 20 billion rubles, equivalent to $3.774 billion, to revive and develop the economy. Subscriptions are pouring in from all over the country. Although the government is only requesting workers to subscribe for one month's salary, many workers are willing to contribute six weeks to three months' salary. Individual subscriptions are as high as 25,000 rubles per person. The bonds will be repaid over 20 years, with prize money awarded by lottery according to bond number. According to Finance Minister Zverev in the broadcast, the bonds will be used for the first Five-Year Plan after the war and to strengthen military-economic power. Only Soviet citizens may purchase the bonds, which are exempt from property and income taxes. The winning numbers can receive a maximum prize of 50,000 rubles per 100-ruble bond, which is also tax-free. The Soviet Union will need 250 billion rubles in the next few years to engage in construction, strengthen defense, and maintain national security. This bond issue is equivalent to 8% of the total amount needed.</p>
<h3>Panda Arrives in Chengdu, to Be Flown to England by Special Plane</h3>

<h3>MacArthur Orders Dismissal of Hatoyama: Cabinet Formation in Japan Thwarted; Efforts of All Parties Come to Naught, Political Situation Returns to Square One</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th] Yesterday, the Shidehara Cabinet sent Foreign Minister Yoshida to visit MacArthur to request approval for Jiyuto President Ichiro Hatoyama to serve as the new Prime Minister. According to the purge directive of February 4, MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to dismiss Hatoyama and strip him of all public office. The reasons for Hatoyama being subject to the purge order are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Served as Chief Secretary of the Tanaka Cabinet from 1927 to 1929, and formulated the Public Security Preservation Law. (2) Served as Minister of Education in the Inukai Cabinet from 1931 to 1934, suppressing freedom of speech, thought, and assembly. (3) Forced the dissolution of agricultural and labor organizations. (4) Consistently supported totalitarianism and aggression.</p>
<p>[Gaizo Nippo Tokyo, 4th] After MacArthur's headquarters announced the dismissal of Jiyuto's Hatoyama today, the question of who will succeed as Prime Minister has become a problem again. The stripping of Hatoyama of all public office is a bolt from the blue for the Jiyuto, suffering a fatal blow. Although the party is cooperating with the Progressive Party, because the Socialist Party has stated in advance that it opposes the Progressive Party, the result is that a cabinet centered on the Socialist Party may be formed, or a non-partisan figure may be elected as Prime Minister by drawing together all parties. There is no other way to go. Thus, on the thirteenth day after the collapse of the Shidehara Cabinet, the Japanese government has fallen back into a state of chaos. The efforts of the parties over the past two weeks have come to naught, and they must start again.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Likely to Be New Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco broadcast, 5th: After MacArthur rejected Hatoyama as Prime Minister, Yoshida is the most likely candidate.</p>
<h3>Hoover Arrives in Seoul from Shanghai Yesterday for Inspection; To Fly to Tokyo Today; American Troops Will Line Up to Welcome and Be Inspected by Him</h3>

Those who went to the airport to see him off yesterday morning included Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, He De-kui, senior US military officers, and many UNRRA personnel.</p>
<h3>American Escaped Convicts Fight Military and Police for Ten Hours from a Strategic High Ground</h3>
<p>[Reuters San Francisco, 4th] The riot at Alcatraz Prison has not yet been quelled. US Marines, together with police and prison guards, are engaged in fierce fighting with a hundred of America's toughest convicts. It is reported that two prison guards have died and five have been seriously injured. There may also be deaths among the guards being held hostage by the prisoners. According to unconfirmed reports, one prisoner initially seized a guard's firearm and infiltrated the armory, frightening the guards there into not resisting, and seized weapons, and opened the main switch, releasing a large number of prisoners. The prison was in a state of terror all night. The location of the riot is the main prison building, which is located on a hilltop, so the prisoners have the advantage of shooting from a high position. They have a lot of weapons and ammunition, so the situation is still quite critical. As of the time of the report, the fighting has continued for ten hours. The authorities have ordered the use of tear gas, and two destroyers and several patrol boats have also sailed to the island to prevent prisoners from escaping across the one-and-a-half-mile channel to the mainland. Many residents of the San Francisco coast are watching, and black smoke can be seen rising from the prison through telescopes on the shore. However, prison officials called to say that the prisoners did not set the fire.</p>
<h3>Hurley to Participate in Senate Race</h3>

<h3>US Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz Opposes Merger of Army and Navy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 3rd] US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz recently expressed his opinion to the Senate Naval Committee, firmly opposing the merger of the Army and Navy into one department. He said: Unified command is essential in operations, but it is absolutely unnecessary when drafting military strategies. If there is only one Ministry of Defense in the Cabinet during peacetime, the President's responsibility will be increased. In short, the merger proposal will reduce the combat effectiveness of the US Marine Corps.</p>
<h3>International Tribunal Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Okawa Again Shouts Loudly in Court and Is Escorted Out for Examination; Indictment Read, Trial to Resume Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th] The trial of Tojo and other war criminals continued today. When the indictment was read, Okawa Shumei shouted loudly again in the courtroom, but no one knew what he was shouting. Then Okawa's defense lawyer, Ohara, stood up and asked the presiding judge to allow Okawa to withdraw, on the grounds that Okawa had already suffered a nervous breakdown. The court granted his request.</p>
<p>During the recess, a reporter spoke with Ohara, who said: In 1939, Okawa worked hard in Shanghai to end the war in China and had disputes with Japanese warlords, and was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Today, the court clerk read the unfinished part of the indictment from yesterday, from Article 48 to Article 55. The full text was read.</p>
<p>After the chief defense lawyer reported that the process was finished, the court ordered all defendants to be returned to custody, and the trial will resume at 9:30 AM on Monday.</p>
<p>Okawa Wants to Kill Tojo</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 4th] Japanese war criminal Okawa Shumei slapped Tojo's bald head twice yesterday in the Far East International Tribunal. At the opening of the trial today, presiding judge Webb ordered him to be expelled from the court. A few minutes after leaving the court, Okawa told a United Press reporter in still fluent English: "I will kill Tojo." Okawa's complexion was pale, but he said, "I am in good health because I benefit from air therapy. Please give me a cigarette." Okawa once advocated the Mukden Incident as a civilian intellectual, but the reasons he stated for wanting to kill Tojo were incoherent, only saying: "This move will benefit the country." In his rambling explanation, he mentioned past deceptions.</p>
<p>Referred to Doctors for Examination</p>
<p>Okawa again made the strange move of slapping Tojo's head yesterday and showed his hideous face to the photographers. Today's target was Captain Stickel, an officer of the General Headquarters News Office, who was hit hard by this thin prisoner. The photographers immediately turned on their flashes and took pictures of him. Presiding Judge Webb, seeing this, announced the appointment of two neuropsychiatrists to examine him to determine whether the criminal was mentally capable of defending himself. If the two doctors' diagnoses are inconsistent, the court will appoint a third person to participate in the examination.</p>
<p>Irrelevant Nonsense</p>
<p>After Okawa was taken to a room behind the courtroom, he lay on the bed. The photographers took pictures of him. At first, he did not move at all, then suddenly sat up and said in English: "I am very good!" He then explained his theory of air therapy and said: "I am preparing a deadly air weapon." When asked whether he was guilty or innocent, Okawa replied: "I and the happy merchant are good friends!" When asked again, he said: "I and him will do business together," but did not specify what kind of business.</p>

However, the crystal stones of the mountain were destroyed by the enemy during the occupation.

The monthly interest rate is at least 40%, and some are as high as 50%. After the disaster, the victims were exploited, digging flesh to mend sores, even more unable to make ends meet. It is clear that the pawn management rules are not perfect, resulting in this situation. The Provisional Council, in view of this, revised it at the third resident committee meeting and submitted it to the province for record and implementation. The main points include strictly restricting the addition of new shops and stipulating that the highest interest rate shall not exceed 25%. If the redemption is made at the end of the half-year period, the interest for up to two months may be retained, which is beneficial to the poor.</p>

Because of his misconduct and lack of military discipline, the county government ordered his dismissal and appointed Su Yingnan to take over. The handover was on April 29. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 AM on May 1, the soldiers, incited by Liu, demanded that Captain Su issue three months of back pay. When Su was answering politely, he was suddenly shot and killed by the soldiers on the spot. Liu Jiyuan then led the soldiers to rob door-to-door for three hours. More than 100 soldiers in the entire team fled east by sea boat with Liu. It was found that the loss was more than 700 dan of rice and unvalued property. At 7:00 AM that morning, Qi Zhihong, the district chief of Zhapu, personally reported to the county government. Later, he consulted with the Provisional Council and the county party headquarters and other officials, and sent personnel to Zhapu to express condolences and investigate the truth. According to those familiar with the inside story, the cause of the disaster was indeed the failure to issue three months of back pay, and the government changed people suddenly without any preparation, which led to this disaster.</p>

<h3>City Police Bureau to Implement "Police District System" for Police Officers; To Make Regular Visits to Households in the Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to improve the knowledge level of police officers and to go deep into the people so that the police and the people can become one, the City Police Bureau will implement the "Police District System" from June 1. That is, each police officer will be in charge of 80 to 120 households or 400 to 600 people in the branch bureau district. Each police officer will be able to go to the households under his jurisdiction from time to time for regular visits, in order to understand the details of each household, so that criminals and bandits have nowhere to hide. This new type of control is very helpful to the city's police prevention, so the bureau is very careful in the selection of these police officers. In addition to the 376 police officers recently transferred from the Central Police Officer Training Corps, the bureau selected 75 junior high school graduates from the original 780-odd veteran police officers, who were approved to be police officers after passing the examination and screening, and concentrated on training together with the police officers who were out of tune in the middle of the month from the 1st to the 10th of this month. After the 11th, they will be assigned to each bureau for internship for 20 days. After being considered qualified, they will be assigned to a designated jurisdiction to start formal service. If there is no fault, they will not be transferred for at least six months to ensure proficiency. It is also heard that the bureau believes that the city area is vast and the citizens are of mixed quality, and the existing 400-odd police officers are not enough to be assigned. In order to facilitate the implementation, 150 male police officers and 50 female police officers will be recruited immediately.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's High Court Held Multiple Trials of Traitors; Judge Severely Reprimands False Officials Who Turn Red with Shame; Hu Zewu Mistakenly Believed in the "Peace Movement"; Wang Defan's Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 11th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The false Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Hu Zewu was interrogated yesterday morning at 10 AM by Judge Qiu Huan-ying at the High Court's Provisional Criminal Tribunal. Hu admitted without hesitation to his positions in the puppet regime, claiming that everything he did was administrative work, all of which was helping out, and only regretting that he had mistakenly believed in the "Peace Movement." He now only asks the court to handle the case fairly. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Hu was a native of Jurong, Jiangsu, 40 years old, residing at 633 Haige Road. He graduated from the Law Department of Beiping University of Fire in his early years and studied constitutional law in Japan. After returning to China, he served as Secretary of the Central Political Committee, Special Committee Member, and Secretary of the National Defense Supreme Council. Hu was originally the brother-in-law of the traitor Luo Junqiang and had known the traitor Zhou Fohai for a long time. When the War of Resistance broke out, Luo, Zhou, and other traitors followed the traitor Wang Jingwei in seeking peace with the enemy. Hu also came to Shanghai from Chongqing via Hong Kong in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] to participate in the "Peace Movement."</p>
<p>When the traitor Hu Zewu arrived in court yesterday, he was wearing a long blue cloth robe and half-worn yellow leather shoes. He was a burly man. According to his testimony, he only did administrative work while holding positions in the puppet regime, did not engage in "politics," and often shut himself up to reflect and read. During his half-year in Anhui, he devoted himself to managing the Huai River, eliminating local ruffians, and never harmed the people. Judge Qiu immediately asked, "Aren't you harming the people by being a traitor? How many soldiers sacrificed and bled on the front lines, how many compatriots were displaced in the rear, can you traitors shirk your responsibility?" Hu replied, "This should be the responsibility of the main leaders. I was just helping out out of friendship." Judge Qiu rebuked, "You have feelings for your friends, but don't you have feelings for your country, for your nation, for your compatriots?" The traitor Hu's face turned red with shame; he remained silent. Judge Qiu, considering that the case still required investigation, ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Fang Lixiang</p>
<p>During the trial of Fang Lixiang, it was noted that Fang was a native of Guangdong, 37 years old, residing at 265, Lane 270, 4 Seymour Road. He graduated from the Engineering Department of National Fudan University and studied papermaking engineering at the Imperial University of Japan. In mid-April of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he was introduced by the traitor Lin Baisheng to serve as a Senior Secretary in the Puppet Propaganda Department. In March of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he also served as the Director of General Affairs of the Puppet National Movement Committee. He wore a wide, old, and faded long shirt, dirty, worn-out white leather shoes, and his beard and hair were unkempt. Regarding his positions in the puppet regime, he claimed to have been a chemistry teacher who was impoverished and ill, and that he only took the puppet position under duress, so the claim of willingly betraying the country was false. The prosecutor filed charges under Article 2, Section 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Li Wenqi</p>
<p>Li Wenqi, another traitor, was also tried. Li was originally an officer in the Supplies Department of the 4th Detachment of the Shanghai Southern Advance Team of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army. In the summer of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], when the enemy puppets launched the Clear the Countryside campaign, Li came to Shanghai and became a secret agent for the Shanghai Southern Gendarmerie, secretly reporting the Deputy Adjutant of the Loyal Salvation Army, Wu Senlin, who was arrested and imprisoned, only to be released after the victory. However, Li denied the accusations. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation.</p>
<p>Traitor Zhang Deqin is Still Ill</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Deqin, the traitor and head of the Finance Department of the Puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, was originally scheduled for questioning this morning. However, Zhang was unable to attend due to a heart condition, so the interrogation was postponed. Furthermore, yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huan-ying, concluded the trial of the traitor Wang Defan in a joint court session. The sentencing is scheduled for 2:30 PM on May 11th.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Executive Yuan's Engineering Planning Team's Work Over the Past Two Months; Preliminary National Engineering Plan Prepared</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] It has been two months since the Engineering Planning Team of the Executive Yuan established its headquarters in Shanghai. To understand the recent development of the team's work, the reporter visited Mr. Tang Zhenxu, engineer and chief secretary of the team, who informed us that the team's work has been actively promoted since its establishment. The main task is to restore and build national transportation infrastructure. Over the past two months, the team's engineers, together with American experts, have inspected national railways, highways, water conservancy, and other projects in batches. A "Preliminary National Engineering Plan" has now been prepared to be presented to President Song for applying for loans from the United States.

<h3>Airmail Postage Increase; Originally 23 Yuan, Now Changed to 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Post Office News: Previously, airmail postage was 23 yuan per item, of which 20 yuan was ordinary postage and the remaining 3 yuan was airmail postage. It is reported that this method was stipulated in March of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, ordinary postage was 2 yuan per letter. When ordinary postage was adjusted to 20 yuan per letter on October 1st of last year, airmail postage was not revised at the same time due to the initial stage of repatriation. However, the airmail fee of 3 yuan per ten centimeters of national currency was far from sufficient to cover expenses. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, the airmail fee has been adjusted to 30 yuan per ten centimeters of national currency. Including the ordinary postage of 20 yuan, each letter costs 50 yuan. The city post office will implement this starting from the 4th of this month. It is also heard that the airmail fee will be entirely allocated to the airline for freight charges.</p>

<h3>Relief Materials for Fishery; Recommended Distribution Principles</h3>
<p>Appeal by the Fisheries Construction Association</p>
<p>The China Fisheries Construction Association, in order to develop China's fisheries and improve the lives of fishermen, has telegraphed the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the National Political Consultative Council, the Executive Headquarters, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and others, stating that after this victory, the United Nations allocated fishery relief materials worth more than US$41 million, including 750 fishing boats of various types, 12,000 wooden boats of all sizes, 40 to 50 cold storage facilities, and more than 30 shipyards. The allied countries' goodwill is deeply appreciated. The association has gathered national fishery organizations and Chinese and foreign fishery experts to jointly discuss the matter, and believes that the distribution of the aforementioned fishery materials should be handled in accordance with the following three principles: First, fishery materials should be accepted by those engaged in fishing. Second, the financial resources of the recipients should be taken into consideration during distribution, and the original purpose of relief should not be violated. Third, the funds received from fishery materials should still be used for the development of fisheries.</p>

<h3>Gao Tianxin and Wife Return East</h3>
<p>Epigraphist Gao Tianxin and his wife Zang Manjun moved west to Sichuan with the National Government when the War of Resistance broke out. In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], Gao witnessed the Japanese planes bombing Chengdu and carved two seals to present to the late US President Roosevelt, attaching a letter to appeal for support from the perspective of the people. Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, sent the seals to the National Art Association of China for review, and they were forwarded to the president after being approved. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], the US State Department representative Mr. Luo expressed his gratitude to Gao for the president's appreciation of the two seals. In the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Gao held personal anti-war seal exhibitions in Chengdu and Chongqing, mostly using quotations from ancient sages and leaders, with one sentence per seal, to encourage popular morale and promote justice. Heads of each branch of the central government, starting with President Lin Sen and including various ministers, provided inscriptions. It is now learned that Mr. and Mrs. Gao plan to sell seals in Shanghai to support themselves. They will host a reception for Shanghai journalists tomorrow, displaying the thank-you letter from the late US President Roosevelt and all the works from the anti-war seal exhibition for viewing.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the May Fourth Movement; Various Groups Enthusiastically Participate; Telegram Sent to Chairman Chiang and Declaration Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday was the 27th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. All sectors of the city held a grand commemoration meeting at Yiyuan yesterday morning. Participants included dozens of units such as the Women's Association, Fudan University, Xiaoguang Middle School, Xinjian Middle School, Pudong Middle School, and Anhui Refugee Youth Group, totaling over 10,000 people. Order within the venue was maintained by military police, security guards, youth groups, boy scouts, and others. A police band attended and played music. The presidium of the meeting consisted of representatives from nine groups: the People's Freedom Protection Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, the Student Union, the Large Education Union, the Middle Education Union, the Small Education Union, the Education Association, the Women's Association, and the Youth Group: Tao Baichuan, Li Shouyong, Cao Jun, Qian Jianqiu, Xi Zhenyong, Hu Huaitian, Gao Wenbai, Li Chengxuan, and Fei Shusheng. Guests included Deputy Mayor He, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Education Bureau Director Gu, and General Labor Union Zhou Xuexiang.</p>
<p>Completing the Mission; Striving for Peace and Unity</p>
<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Tao Baichuan delivered a speech stating that the May Fourth Movement had a significant impact on consolidating the national foundation, awakening national consciousness, reforming culture, and promoting society. The current political situation is as unstable as it was during the May Fourth era, so today's youth should inherit the revolutionary spirit of May Fourth and strive for peace and unity to complete the unfinished mission of May Fourth. Deputy Mayor He, on behalf of Mayor Qian, exhorted the youth, stating that the task of reconstruction is a heavy responsibility, so they should work hard in their studies, not indulge in empty words, and immerse themselves in practical work. Only with real talent and knowledge can they shoulder this important task.</p>
<p>Youth Thought; Hasten Liberation and Freedom</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan then gave a speech stating that today's commemoration of May Fourth should not only maintain this revolutionary, patriotic, and national spirit, but also promote and enhance it. Recalling that since the May Fourth Movement, through the success of the National Revolution and the Northern Expedition, to the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance, we have finally achieved victory. But now, there are those who want to destroy this beautiful result. A few days ago, it was reported in the newspapers that the Communist Party had signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union in the Northeast. What are the terms of this agreement? If it is true, it is no different from the Twenty-One Demands. The government should be responsible for signing treaties with other countries. Our country and the Soviet Union have already signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and no other treaties are allowed, let alone secret treaties. This fact is painful to say. What was the May Fourth Movement for 27 years ago? What was the eight-year War of Resistance for?</p>
<p>Pan continued, stating that the May Fourth Movement was also for the liberation of thought and freedom, but some young people, after leaving the "Confucian Shop," entered the "Marx Shop," idolizing Marx, Stalin, and Lenin. In this way, thought is not free, but equally constrained. Therefore, in today's new May Fourth Movement, young people should quickly withdraw from the "Marx Shop" and achieve true freedom of thought. Education Bureau Director Gu said that we should be open in our actions, not secretive, and act with conscience and conviction, which is the best way to love the country. At this point, it suddenly started to rain. The conference passed a telegram to Chairman Chiang and a nationwide appeal for unity, for the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, for relief for refugee youth, for increasing teachers' salaries, and issued a declaration. The conference then adjourned. The planned parade was also canceled due to the rain.</p>
<p>On the same morning, the Shanghai branch of the "Literary Association" held a literary morning meeting at the Lyceum Theatre. Madame Sun Yat-sen also attended the meeting. The program included speeches by Ye Shengtao, Zhou Yutong, and Xu Guangping, poetry recitation by Li Jianwu, storytelling by Zhao Jingshen, and "Brother and Sister Reclamation" Yangko by Ouyang Shanzun and Li Lilian, as well as Kunqu Opera, flute, and violin performances.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Department of Education Revises Implementation Measures; Strengthens National Education in Border Areas; Handled Separately in Han and Non-Han Areas</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu] In order to strengthen national education in border areas, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education has recently revised the implementation measures for national education in border areas, dividing them into two categories: Han areas and non-Han areas. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Han Areas</p>
<p>(1) Centralized School Establishment: It is not sufficient to establish schools according to the bao due to lack of manpower and financial resources. Key locations should be selected to concentrate resources and establish central schools and national schools, without establishing them in every township or town to avoid waste. (2) Public Funding: All students should be boarding students, provided with meals. Poor children should receive two dan of rice per year, those less poor should receive five dou of rice, and those who can support themselves will not receive subsidies. (3) Opening Private Schools: The qualifications of teachers and the funding of private schools should be relaxed as much as possible, but attention should be paid to assessment and rewards.</p>
<p>Non-Han Areas</p>
<p>(1) Mobile Education: Starting from Han areas, good teachers should be selected and sent to gradually implement education, starting from nearby and moving further away. (2) Teacher Selection: Teachers should have a spirit of perseverance and good intelligence. Talented individuals should be selected from graduates of various normal schools and given short-term training. Their treatment should be preferential. The mandatory service period for those sent to border areas should be shortened from three years to one year to encourage them. (3) Number of Teachers: 10 to 15 teachers per county. (4) Supervision and Command: The existing Maohe, Bianding, and Folk Life Guidance Centers should increase their staff and funding to handle the education of people in various counties. (Quan)</p>

<h3>There Are Many Speculative Transactions Involving U.S. Dollars; The Price of Gold Is Generally Stable; The Allotment Price Is Raised to 1.62 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Huazi continued to be stable. The Bank of China's allotment price slightly increased to 1.62 million following the general sentiment. There were 417 registered items, and 365 actual receipts. It was found that the morning opening was flat and weak. After opening, retail investors and free funds came to absorb some of it, and the gold shops also bought in, once rising to around 1.65 million. However, due to tight credit, there was a tightening trend from time to time, and the majority were not without caution. Soon it fell back again. The Bank of China's allotment fluctuated around 1.62 million. After the allotment was completed, there was little special activity until noon. It struggled to reach 1.63 million. In the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly relieved, and finally it stabilized slightly. The result was a slight increase of 15,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 175,000, and bar silver and silver dollars were flat. Although the underground money market has seen some relaxation, the interest rate is still unwilling to ease, and still stands at around 20%. Next Monday, there will be a large amount of material settlement, which cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of speculative purchases of U.S. dollars. The spread narrowed to 710 yuan for ten taels, and there were sporadic settlements. The morning opening was 2,230 yuan, then it rose all the way to 2,340 yuan, and then it slightly fell back, hovering around 2,290 yuan. There was little progress in the later market. The result was a good 50 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were weak and then gradually stabilized. The results were 5 yuan higher for both new and old dollars. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 450 yuan, and the rupee was 550 yuan, both showing prosperity. The listing price of U.S. exchange rates remained flat.</p>
<h3>Gold Shipped from the United States to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling 390,000 Taels</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] In the midst of the stable gold price in this city, according to reporters from reliable sources, 393,000 taels of gold, divided into 121 large barrels, were shipped from the United States by the Sea Eagle Wheel. This morning, the Central Bank transported them all to the warehouse. Also this morning, the Central Bank sold a total of 518 taels of gold according to the needs of the gold shops and gold industry in this city, supplying them in full at the then market price of 1.62 million yuan. The number of legal tender returned to the Central Bank this week was extremely large, and the number of those who purchased foreign exchange from the Central Bank was also small, resulting in an extremely tight money market.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Turns Firm; Trading of Raw Cotton Comes to a Standstill</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned around yesterday. The Ningbo gang continued to show demand, and 20-count Double Horse rose by 20,000. The remaining miscellaneous brands were taken by the inland gangs who chose cheaper ones, and the price also rose by 10,000 to 30,000. The 42-count Double Strand thread has fallen sharply in recent days, which has aroused the demand of weaving factories. Sporadic transactions are quite lively. The weakness seems to have passed, and people's hearts have turned firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams rose by 2 to 6 basis points. The near-term price was $27.58, the far-term price was $27.73, and the Milling spot price was $28.16. Raw cotton trading in this port has completely stalled. Because of the Saturday connection, and gold, U.S. dollars, and yarn prices have not developed in a special way, manufacturers and flower houses are watching and waiting, with no news of negotiations.</p>
<h3>Silk Is Soft</h3>
<p>Fangjian Opens and Sells Rayon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of rayon No. 120 at Tianqiao in the morning was 1.48 million yuan. The highest bid was 1.54 million yuan. As a result, the closing price was 1.51 million yuan. In the afternoon, because the allotted silk was shipped that day, people's hearts were weak, and it fell back slightly, trading at 1.45 million yuan, 20,000 yuan shorter than the previous day, and miscellaneous brands were 30,000 yuan shorter. The remaining goods of each number remained at the original prices of the previous day. Factory transactions were quiet. Foreign firm goods only had inquiries and no transactions. 81-point evenness Dachang offered a price of 2.5 million yuan. User silk had some transactions, and each grade was about 50,000 yuan shorter. Silk goods were flat and weak. Meiya quilt covers had a transaction at 1.05 million yuan in the morning, and Dacheng checks were 3,760 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Also, enemy rayon, handled by enemy property management, has been entrusted to the China Textile Construction Company to sell. The company publicly listed the price yesterday, and the sales method is the same as the situation of selling cotton yarn. It is said that the quantity is very large, and it is now actively counting, and it is decided to sell it publicly once a week.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Is Gradually Entering Its Prime; Foreign Firms Have Begun to Handle Goods</h3>
<p>The tea market has been gradually entering its prime in recent days, with active buying interest. Especially the Tianjin gang has a tendency to accept all comers for Baozhong and Zhulan tea. Holders are taking the opportunity to call high, so the price is gradually increasing. Other colors are also being added by stores and shops on this street and in Suzhou. The market is generally firm.</p>
<p>On the foreign firm side, the demand in Europe and the United States is quite strong at present. Although the new tea has already appeared, the tea for export has not yet been made. Now, Jardine Matheson is selecting goods with excellent quality to meet the urgent need. It is reported that Chen Zhenmei has completed 200 boxes (the price is 32,000 yuan per dan). It is planned to be sold to Morocco in Africa within a few days. As for Mumbai, India, it is also frequently favored. Recently, the Baitou Zhuang Ruichang Foreign Firm purchased 700 boxes of Chou Gong (the price is 38,000 yuan per dan) and is waiting for the opportunity to export it.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Continue to Rise; The Stock Market Wants to Revive but Is Powerless</h3>
<p>Public bonds will start to meander again next week. Each active element is unstable due to the unstable terrain. Although they want to cheer up, they finally feel weak. As a result, it is inevitable that they will soften at the beginning of the opening, once falling back to the 5,500 yuan level. After that, the money market gradually relaxed, and there was no particularly panic-inducing stimulation, so it rose back to around 6,150 yuan. At noon, it hovered outside the 6,000 yuan level. As a result, it rose slightly by 150 yuan compared to the previous close. A, B, and D rose from 3,850 yuan to 4,300 yuan, a rebound of 450 to 500 yuan. E-type ended with a high price of 4,500 yuan from a weak 4,000 yuan, an increase of 350 yuan. Chinese stocks have also slightly improved due to the tense situation in recent days. However, because retail investors are too hasty, the staying power is insufficient, and the high price is weak. At noon, it ended at a low price. In the middle, the highest Yongsha was 5,600 yuan, Meiya was 4,730 yuan, Jingfu was 475 yuan, Xinguang was 390 yuan, and Qinxing was 340 yuan. Then, it was gradually suppressed by the multiple parties' sales. The noon collection became worse and worse, and the bid was lower and lower as time passed. As a result, compared with the previous hot two hot ones, it continued to fall slightly, and the three small ones have returned to show, and the rise and fall of the colder stocks are limited. Foreign stocks rose slightly at the beginning of the market. Yisha struggled at 14,900 yuan. Soon, Chinese stocks could not support themselves and retreated. The stocks followed Yisha to the lower reaches. As a result, Yisha fell 900 yuan, and Yinglian fell 1,400. Although the remaining stocks fell but not much.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Sugar Are Flat; The Supply of Xianglian Goods Is Short and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market turned flat. The market price of medium-sized white sugar in the Association's disk revolved between 59,000. The initial market was 59,000 yuan, up to 59,500 yuan. It once reached 60,000 yuan. In the end, it was still 59,000 yuan. The goods opened, and the transaction was very scattered. It is because the market party is aware that the market image is not stable and dare not be greedy.</p>
<p>Xianglian has turned tighter due to the lack of stock and storage. It was found that the previous price was around 200,000 yuan. Now, those with good color and large particles have risen to 225,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Siamese Rice Exports Are Expected to Reach 60,000 Tons Per Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters Singapore, 4th] Southeast Asian envoy Lord Killearn broadcasted yesterday that the United Food Board estimated that Siam and Burma could export 280,000 tons of rice in the second quarter of this year, but the actual export volume is likely to be no more than 153,000 tons. If transportation is not accelerated, the situation will inevitably become more serious. Since January 1, Siam has exported 114,000 tons of rice. It is hoped that 60,000 tons can be exported every month in the future.</p>
<h3>The Price of Black Tea for Export Is Above That of Ceylon</h3>
<p>The production cost of black tea for export from China is about 67,000 yuan per dan. The current price in Shanghai is about 90,000 yuan. Adding transportation insurance and other expenses, it is actually more than 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the market price of Ceylon black tea in the United States is now 30 cents per pound, which is about 78,000 yuan per dan, which is lower than the domestic market price in China. Therefore, it is difficult to compete with Ceylon tea.</p>
<h3>The Timber Market Is Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market was quite stagnant. It was heard that more than 2 million feet of Yangsong had arrived at the port, and people's hearts were softened. In the market, there was no master to receive a large amount of transactions. However, sporadic color assignments were still not lonely. Hangzhou wood and Dantong have been selling well recently.</p>
<h3>Britain, America and Siam Manage to Set Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Bangkok, 4th] The official exchange rate between the Siamese currency and the pound sterling was set at 40 to 1 yesterday. The Siamese currency is now worth one U.S. dollar for every ten yuan. According to the previous semi-official exchange rate, every sixty Siamese yuan is equal to one pound, and every fifteen yuan is equal to one U.S. dollar.</p>
<h3>The Price of Rice Fluctuates; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of the rice market was very stagnant. Japonica and indica yuan rice fell by about 1,000 yuan. After the flour fell continuously, the sales of the stores became smoother, and rebounded by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market turned active sporadically. Ningbo Bang asked about it slightly. The price stopped falling and rebounded, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The sales of bean cake followed suit, and also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. The bran husk Xiangxiao also moved, and it rose sharply by 800 to 900 yuan. Yellow soybeans rose by more than 1,000 yuan due to the rise in prices of various commodities. Raw kernels were tired and revived, and also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, red grains had little magic and were stagnant. Cotton cake was still downstream. Yesterday's market was the opposite of the previous day. The price of rice fell back, and the price of oil cake miscellaneous grains and flour bran rose in unison. According to the rice market, it was reported yesterday that there were a total of 4,000 stones of white japonica and other 7 types in this city. The types and stones are as follows: white japonica 2,066, thin rice 1,098, early rice 63, Sanyang indica 105, Du indica 433, Bai Yuan 75, Yin Yuan 70.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Costs Are Too High; Export Transactions Are Suspended</h3>
<p>The Chinese Plant Oil Factory purchased more than 300 tons of tung oil in winter last year in Wan and other places in Chongqing. After burning and canning in Wan, it started to be transported this spring. It was transported by wooden boats in the Wanyi section, by tugboats in the Yihan section, and by wheels in the Hanshu section. The cost of transshipment is also high. It is reported that it costs about 30,000 yuan per city dan to transport from Wan to Shanghai. It takes half a year from purchase to loading and arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first batch of more than 100 tons of Sichuan Tung oil from the factory has recently arrived in this city. This batch of tung oil has been delivered to the Soviet Union for barter by the Central Trust Bureau. The remaining 100 tons can be shipped within this month.</p>
<p>According to reports, the recent tung price in the inland is 39,000 yuan in Chongqing, 38,000 yuan in Wanxian, and 52,300 yuan in Hankou (based on each market in sufficient degree tung oil). The Shanghai price is currently weaker due to weak domestic sales, and exporters are watching and waiting, and only hovering around 72,000 yuan. Merchants can no longer profit from transporting and selling in Shanghai from the place of origin.</p>
<p>It is reported that although the United States needs tung oil from China, it is limited by the market price. The current purchase price offered by the U.S. merchants in Shanghai is only 37 cents per pound (U.S. dollars), and it must be delivered to the wheel. Since the shippers do not calculate it, the trade of tung oil to the United States in the past two months has not been concluded except for the original transactions.</p>
<h3>Bristles Are Not Selling Well; Due to the Prevalence of Nylon</h3>
<p>[Chongqing News] In the international market, the price of bristles has a downward trend. According to a report two weeks ago, 27th-grade domestic goods were worth 3 U.S. dollars a pound, delivered in New York, worth about 600,000 legal currency per dan. With the current Chongqing price plus other expenses, the cost of shipping to the United States is nearly 900,000 yuan per dan, in which case it is possible to lose 2300,000 yuan per dan. The main reason why bristles have entered this depression is the application of nylon. The raw materials are easy to obtain, the cost is also light, and the finished products are durable, while the quality of bristles is poor and not practical. Therefore, if you want to save this decline and regain the foreign market for bristles, you can only find ways to refine them and reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Industry Appeals to Apply for Currency Trading</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] There are currently 188 members of the Municipal Money Exchange Industry Association. The scope of business in peacetime is to specialize in the buying and selling of currencies of various countries. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange, they are called Class A licensed operators. Among the members who have been approved by the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Review, there are only 81 members. The remaining 107 members misunderstood the provisions of the regulations at that time, and did not study the application procedures in detail. They voluntarily gave up their rights. Now, those who hold vouchers are in danger of having their business suspended, and their own business is mainly based on the purchase and sale of foreign currency banknotes. Once they are suspended, they will be unable to maintain their livelihoods. The board of directors has been convened to make a statement to remedy the situation. This morning, President Wang Yuncheng personally went to the Foreign Exchange Review Office to appeal for supplementary registration in order to save the livelihoods of the members.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Western Medicine: Consigners compete to sell out in view of the inflow of foreign goods, and the spot price falls again.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials: The price of gold and U.S. dollars has fallen in recent days, and the raw materials have also fallen with it. The market is flat.</p>
<p>Leather: Generally stable, but the surface is slightly softened, and the transaction is not strong.</p>
<h3>Expensive Telegraph Fees Hinder Exports</h3>
<p>[Chongqing News] According to import merchants, my country's foreign trade has gradually become active recently. However, the foreign telegraph prices set by the government are not suitable for export conditions. For example, the government stipulates that at least 25 characters must be sent each time, and those who do not have 25 characters will still be charged according to this number. In addition, the recently reported fee has increased from 3,250 yuan to 19,000 yuan, which is six times higher than before, which invisibly increases the cost of export goods. This type of reporting method hinders the development of export trade. It is hoped that the government will reduce it to suit the export trade.</p>

<p>Theater Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Promotion Chart"</h3>
<p>— Family</p>
<p>Dreams are inspiration, not illusion. Chen Baichen writes in his play "Promotion Chart": I know this play "Promotion Chart" will sting a small group of people, but it is a universally existing reality. Whoever denies it is hiding their illness from the doctor. Whoever acknowledges its reality has the courage to improve it.</p>
<p>The performance of "Promotion Chart" swept away the past sluggish box office of spoken drama, not only because of the novelty of copper coin eyes, safes, and other devices, and the cartoonish makeup... "Promotion Chart" gained the love of a large audience because the playwright, director, designer, and actors expressed the audience's own feelings, hatred, and curses towards this group of characters in this play. The audience laughed together because the embarrassment of the characters on stage alleviated their depression and increased their contempt for this group of people. The laughter was filled with the meaning of "boo."</p>
<p>However, the sensational success of this performance cannot solely rely on the original author. If a clumsy director, stage designer, or actor were to encounter it, they could make a brilliant script lose its color. Putting a cartoonish exterior on this comedy "Promotion Chart" made the content and characters of the script more prominent. It made the ugliness hidden in reality more obvious and also gave the staff more space to unleash their imagination to the fullest extent. How lifeless this script would become if realistic techniques were used!</p>
<p>The set is where the characters appear and disappear. It must be able to represent the characteristics of this group of protagonists. Designer Ding Cong designed the set with only one hall, opening the central hall as a "copper coin eye," the walls are banknotes, the door is a money cabinet, and a large piece of "loot" is hanging in mid-air. Therefore, what exactly is this group of characters who come and go through the copper coin eyes, enter and exit the money cabinet, carrying loot on their heads, and facing banknotes? The audience can see it at a glance. The same design in the characters' costumes also follows the principle of abstracting personality. The most distinctive is naturally the Director of the Finance Bureau, who wears yuanbao on his head, steps on yuanbao, wears banknotes, and carries three bags of exorbitant taxes. The Director of Education is no less impressive, wearing a doctoral hat and a long robe of the Four Books and Five Classics. On the other hand, the makeup also tends towards a cartoon style. The face of the Police Chief is simply Hitler. The only character whose makeup is not based on their own position is the Director of Public Works. Where is the Director of Public Works? It is actually a modern "Hu Si"! What a pungent satire!</p>
<p>The best actor is Lan Ma as the Provincial Governor. When he is serious, he is so solemn and dignified, his actions are so heavy, and when he is smiling, he is also full of the demeanor of someone in high position. He did not flaunt his skills to create colorful brilliance, but his brilliance is intrinsic. A frown, a smile, a raise of a hand, a step, are simple and natural. His acting skills have reached a state of perfection. Zhou Qi is very outstanding in portraying the Director of the Finance Bureau's demeanor of absolute power. The Director of Education's two-facedness and the Secretary-General's shrewd cunning all have their unique qualities.</p>
<p>The director has an absolute and significant influence on the performance. Huang Zuolin not only handled the entire stage lively and orderly in this play, but also sharply and thoroughly. In the third act, he allowed the Provincial Governor to appear on stage naked, wearing only a bellyband. After enough gold bars were collected, they were stored on the spot in the bags on the bellyband, and then he put on the golden and solemn coat in front of the audience. In the second act, when the county government held a meeting to punish the murderers, the directors all used dialects to express their opinions, which were all excellent. However, the language of the entire play is Mandarin, which is inconsistent with the second act. This should be because that scene was specially emphasized!</p>
<p>Chen Baichen wrote: "No author, when bathing in the sunlight, is willing to return to the dark room to find inspiration." I praise this performance and hope not to see such performances again.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and Liu Qiong are in "Zhongdian"'s new film "Loyal and Righteous Family" which is being filmed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Theater News</h3>
<p>The Bian Theater Troupe performed "Wilderness" at the Anti-Japanese Hall in Chongqing. On the last day, Li Jian, the famous veteran actress who played Jiao Daxian, suddenly fainted on stage when shaking hands with Qiu Hu in the second act due to overwork and anemia.</p>
<p>The China Drama and Art Society, led by Ying Yunwei, is currently rushing to rehearse three plays: "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," "Wedding March," and "Qu Yuan," to be staged after "Promotion Chart."</p>
<h3>News from the Film Studio</h3>
<p>— Lang Qin</p>
<p>"Zhongdian" Second Factory has been working day and night recently. "Loyal and Righteous Family," directed by Wu Yonggang, has been filmed halfway. All staff members have a highly pleasant working spirit.</p>
<p>"Loyal and Righteous Family" has one outdoor set, which is quite magnificent. According to people who have worked in the film industry for a long time; Shanghai has not seen such a large set for many years.</p>
<p>The second program of "Zhongdian" Second Factory is Chen Liting's "Distant Love," with women's issues as the theme. The storyboard has been completed and filming can begin in mid-May. Zhao Dan's script is being written, and Xu Suling is also preparing a script, intending to start filming after "Loyal and Righteous Family" is completed.</p>
<p>"Zhongdian" Third Factory (Beijing) has been actively promoting film production since director Shen Fu arrived in Beijing. Shen Fu is burying himself in shot breakdown. As soon as Wei Heling and Xie Tian arrive, work can begin.</p>

<h3>Deformed Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>After reading Chen Weijun's film review of "Emerging Lotus" in this publication on April 14th, I feel that the film industry in Shanghai after the victory is really too unconventional and too undisciplined. There are many Hollywood-style sexy films with added color. If you don't believe it, you can see a large number of advertisements on newsprint every day that attract color-hungry audiences to indulge themselves! What "fighting for beauty in shallow pools, comparing flesh under triangular pants." "Jade legs," "golden legs," "beautiful legs," endless legs. Of course, not every film is like this. For example, the recent films "The Story of Woodrow Wilson," "Loyal and Courageous Family," "Guardians of the Rhine," and "The Bells of Adano" are all pure in meaning and deeply moving after watching them. They help you increase your knowledge, instill proper culture, and introduce great figures in front of you, making you admire and worship them. However, the Shanghai audience is naive and curious, and most of the audience simply doesn't understand English. Therefore, they only seek magic, dazzling colors, and fascinating kisses. Going to the cinema is only for temporary pleasure. As a result, when the latter films are released, there are few people in front of the cinema, and the box office is terrible.</p>
<p>In this situation, in order to do business, the theater owners have no choice but to show popular films and abandon literary films with dim business prospects. Isn't that a deformed film industry? I can't help but sigh to myself.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the impact: countless young men and women in Shanghai, including college students, middle school students, young civil servants, shop clerks, etc., feel that watching movies is a legitimate form of entertainment and a legitimate pastime. Therefore, they also go to the cinema on Sundays and holidays to spend two hours. However, I think that when a young person sees the pornographic films mentioned above, he will be confused and easily introduced into the abyss of pornography, abandoning his studies and career. Therefore, I appeal to all ladies and gentlemen in the city who love movies to stop showing movies that are extremely pornographic and absurd!</p>

<p>Relief for the Drought. I read in your newspaper that the drought in Guangxi is severe. Grass roots and tree bark have all been eaten. There are even cases of mothers and three children making mud cakes to fill their hunger, resulting in the loss of three lives.

<h3>Request to the Ministry of Education to Add an Examination Center in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Many Benefits for Candidates</p>
<p>Editor Sir: I recently read in your newspaper's education section the Ministry of Education's announcement of the regulations for self-funded study abroad examinations. The examination location section did not include Shanghai. This city has always been the cultural center of our country, with many universities. The number of applicants will inevitably be large. If there is no examination center in this city, everyone will have to go to Nanjing to take the exam. Transportation is inconvenient, and finding accommodation is even more difficult. Time and energy will be lost. I admire your newspaper as the voice of the people. I dare to ask you to forward this to the education authorities and relevant public opinion organizations (such as the Municipal Council, etc.) to request the addition of an examination center in Shanghai. This will greatly benefit the candidates in this city. I wish you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Ji Qingyuan</p>

<h3>Remembering Chongqing</h3>
<p>We, who have already journeyed eastward today, gaze westward at the majestic mountain city standing proudly at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, and read these life stories with piercing hearts, as its seasonal dense fog, from hazy to gradually clear.</p>
<p>We bid farewell to Chongqing, reluctant to part.</p>
<p>Chongqing, once brought us light, hope, justice, victory, excitement, life, and even more so, warmth. It is like the holy city of Jerusalem, symbolizing and entrusting not only the devout faith of all Chinese people. It is the most glorious and dearest place name, which we Chinese call out with great pride.</p>
<p>Eight years of time, boundless hardships, every house, every slope, every bridge pier, every stone cave, every pool of river water, every road, every tree, every flower, every blade of grass, every piece of soil, has written the most touching and unforgettable stories, with blood, with tears, with hunger, with cold, with joy, with anger. It is she, who has carried this all, and engraved this all.</p>
<p>We, who have already journeyed eastward today, gaze westward at the majestic mountain city standing proudly at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, we will silently shed tears, reading these life stories with piercing hearts, as its seasonal dense fog, from hazy to gradually clear.</p>
<p>The Qingnian Road and Shangqing Temple area will first appear in our memories. It was the nerve center of the Anti-Japanese War: the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, the General Mobilization Conference, the Ministry of Transportation, the Wartime Production Bureau, the Resources Commission, etc. Fifty percent of the major institutions were concentrated here. Therefore, this area became particularly active with public servants. Every day around 8:00 in the morning, 12:00 noon, and 5:00 in the afternoon, people bustled back and forth, and the bus waiting area, a long snake formation, lined up for half a street, regardless of the scorching sun or torrential rain, this was the most crowded and congested time.</p>
<p>The temple-like building of the National Government, facing the spacious National Government Road, expressed solemnity amidst tranquility and cleanliness, with a myriad of sights. In addition to the memorial week every Monday morning, many major ceremonies of the government were held here. When the late Chairman Lin Sen was critically ill, countless citizens who loved and respected him gathered in front of its doors every day, reading the condition reports with the most sorrowful hearts.</p>
<p>Winding south from Shangqing Temple, the wartime capital also only had this winding avenue, Zhongshan Road, Roads One, Two, and Three, until the Jiangsu Fellow Association at Qixinggang. This was a relatively high section of Chongqing, and also the main artery on the north side of the entire mountain city. Among them, the highest point was Pipashan, Feilai Temple, the location of the Soviet Embassy. Every year on the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union and Red Army Day, there was a constant stream of traffic, and it was extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>On this section of the road, there were the Broadcasting Building, the Central Propaganda Department, the International Propaganda Office, the Organization Department, the Personnel Examination Department, the Foreign Correspondents' Reception Center, the United States Information Service, the Central News Agency, the Four Allied Offices, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Garrison Headquarters, the Ordnance Department, and the Central Daily News. On the high slope of Chunyang Cave, there were also the China Film Studio and the Kangjian Hall, famous for its drama performances. This was the heartland section, both in terms of the topography of the entire mountain city and the activities of the citizens.</p>
<p>We, who are in Shanghai today, take rickshaws or pedicabs and pass over Sichuan Road Bridge and Tianhou Palace Bridge. Invariably, someone pushes you up, and in the end, you have to spend a hundred-yuan bill. However, compared to the slope from Min Sheng Road, the Joseph's Church to Guanyinyan, this poor man's section, we will lament the strength of the Chongqing rickshaw pullers, and feel ashamed of the pamperedness of people in the plains.</p>
<p>Creating the environment, adapting to the environment, being led by the environment, human intelligence can roughly be divided into these three levels. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the people who fled from the southeast to the southwest were trained by the environment to climb mountains and cross ridges, walking briskly as if flying. This was just a small episode in life, just like eating rationed rice and entering air-raid shelters, becoming a daily scene. They adapted to the environment, and they further created the environment, stirring their hearts and holding back their tears. The tempering of the spirit cultivated the nation's indomitable spirit. The stone steps of Wanglongmen, the stone steps of Shibati, the stone steps of the Triumphal Arch, these small things, we miss them. Imperceptibly, the role they played, the impact on our body and mind, will be worth singing praises to!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Triumphal Arch, it and the Jiangbian cable car of Wanglongmen were both huge new construction projects in Chongqing after the National Government moved its capital. The former was built by the Tianfu Construction Company. Because of it, the upper city and the lower city were connected, and traffic flowed freely, like from Fuzichi to Dapingmen, no longer having to detour far to Nanqu Park or Daomenkou. Its arched Qiongmen, viewed from the front of the Military Affairs Commission, was quite magnificent.</p>
<p>The Jiangbian cable car of Wanglongmen was built by the China Bridge Company, presided over by Mr. Mao Yisheng. The construction process was quite similar to the construction of the western railway in the United States in those years. Even the Municipal Council used it as an important agenda item. A group of officials made all kinds of absurd arguments and opposed it fiercely. Mr. Mao, who had designed and supervised the Qiantang River Bridge, sat upright in the office on the second floor of the company in Lianglukou, and did not delay the progress of the project for a single day. Mr. Mao finally breathed a sigh of relief when the cable car officially started operating. Today, people traveling between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, avoiding the fatigue of climbing up and down more than two hundred stone steps, have they ever thought of the painful feelings of a first-class Chinese engineering expert under attack from all sides during this year and a half from the summer of 1934 to the autumn of 1935?</p>
<p>We should also start with the Jiangsu Fellow Association in Qixinggang. Let's assume that we are sitting on a city bus, and then heading south, down the narrow, steep, and sharply curved slope of Minsheng Road. The scene of a "fishing" car overturning often took place here.</p>
<p>Minsheng Road, formerly known as Wuku Street, can now be called Cultural Street. Large and small bookstores gathered together. The storefront of the Xinhua Daily often staged lively visibility scenes here, such as the shooting of an officer, the conflict of the 2/22 student parade,... The spire church of Joseph's Church, having survived the great bombing, stood tall and unharmed, still spending every morning and evening.</p>
<p>Jiaochangkou, a large square, was usually like the City God Temple in Shanghai. Street performers and various acts were on display, and vendors and stalls shouted and babbled. After a circus dismantled its canopy, the problem of the chairman of the congress created an "incident" that made it famous throughout the country.</p>
<p>The bus turned north here and drove onto Minzu Road (Guanmiao Street, Douyou Street, Dashizi), the essence of the city's commerce. Its sides were lined with shops, companies, and firms, and the road was wide and flat. The branches on the left and right with it as the main trunk were very neat. Movie theaters, Sichuan opera houses, Beijing opera theaters, restaurants, and taverns stood like stars surrounding the moon.</p>
<p>The Spiritual Fortress was formerly Dashizi. It was slightly smaller than Xinjiekou Square in Nanjing. Chairman Chiang accepted the cheers of the city's citizens here. Now, the national flag raising and lowering ceremonies are held here twice a day, morning and evening.</p>
<p>At the Xiaoshizi of Zhongzheng Road, there stood a standard clock, which reported the accurate time to the people in the banking district. But for a period of time, it also became the object of citizens' satire.</p>
<p>The banking district included Shaanxi Street, Daomenkou, and Datong Street. The trading skills of the Shaanxi people are indeed admirable. As early as many years ago, the Shaanxi people controlled the finance of Sichuan. They left this street, which still exerted the power of Wall Street during the Anti-Japanese War. This was a concentration of wealth, with countless banks, money houses, companies, and firms, the place where the national economic pulse beat the most sensitively.</p>
<p>Then, the car arrived at the terminal stop, Guojielou. Pedestrians were mixed, but they wanted to go to Shangqing Temple. They lined up in a long line, waiting for buses that were panting, shaking their heads, and moving slowly. Although people hated the unsound transportation, when they thought that these "old cars" had also traveled thousands of miles from the occupied areas to support themselves here with heavy responsibilities, they would sympathize with its suffering and endure, endure, endure, and endure.</p>
<p>Linsen Road, Nanqu Road, overlooking the Yangtze River, had buses running on it for a period of time, but now it was only possible to walk. This section had the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Park, and the Military Affairs Commission. Further on, the Zhonghang Company's Shanba Airport was located on a sandbar in the river. During the high water levels of the Yangtze River in spring and autumn, the sandbar disappeared, so the airport buildings were temporary sheds.</p>
<p>Then came the semi-mountainous Nanqu Park.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the earthworks and several rusty rails of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are still lying lonely below Nanqu Park. We have been in Sichuan for eight years, and we have not completed this transportation artery, which is only over five hundred kilometers long.</p>
<p>Passing through Caiyuanba, the parachute tower stood tall, and from time to time, soft parachutes gently descended in the air, weaving the special customs of the great wartime capital.</p>
<p>Looking north to Jiangbei, Zengjiayan; looking south to Chunyang Cave; and looking at Chongqing, the best place is to stand on the Nantianmen of Ma'anshan.</p>
<p>The scenery is infinitely good, and the affairs of people change a lot. The air-raid shelters of Chongqing, how many words do you remember it telling us? How many words do you remember us calling out to it!</p>
<p>(Bu Shaofu, Shanghai, on the eve of May Fourth, 1946)</p>
<p>Order for the National Government to Return to the Capital</p>
<p>…Recalling that in these eight years, the enemy has penetrated deeply and suffered heavy losses. If it were not for relying on the vast people of our western region and relying on its abundant land resources, we would not have been able to establish the foundation for today's victory. Sichuan, known as the Land of Abundance in ancient times, is the root of national strength. The Chongqing area controls the north and south with its two rivers, and occupies a strategic location. Therefore, it was able to safely overcome difficulties and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the country will be forever recorded in history and will never be erased…</p>

<p>Special Issue Commemorating the Return of the National Government to the Capital, Part 2</p>
<h3>Four Nanjings</h3>
<p>When the Ministry of Transportation's land, sea, and air routes were insufficient to complete the May Capital Return Plan, the Aeronautical Affairs Commission received an order to assist in the return of the capital. Director Zhou Zhirou immediately prepared thirty C-47 and C-49 transport planes to assist in the return of the capital between Chongqing and Nanjing every day. When the Aeronautical Affairs Commission began its assistance, Director Zhou told the commanders of the units in charge of air transport and the personnel of the Chongqing Jiulongpo Airport and the Nanjing Ming Palace Airport, "In the sky, we are the masters. Not only must you ensure the flight safety of the capital return personnel, but you must also make them enjoy the comfort of being guests. In this way, our air force can not only gallop to the front line to kill enemies in wartime, but also serve in peacetime."</p>
<p>The Air Force Works Hard</p>
<p>The Chongqing Jiulongpo Airport is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, about a twenty-minute car ride from the city. Countless Chinese and foreign guests have come and gone through here. Those who have traveled to and from Chongqing by air all know the image of this dam outside of the dam in the water (Shanba Airport). It is about ten meters above the water surface, with hills on one side and the muddy yellow river water fifty meters below on the other. Passengers on planes taking off from Jiulongpo Airport have the relaxed feeling of "I am rising from the bottom of the water."</p>
<p>In Jiulongpo, after the capital return personnel entered the airport, they rested in a large living room with eight windows to be grouped and weigh their luggage. Then, they were called by name and assigned a boarding number to board the plane. After each person's luggage was weighed, it was carried by airport soldiers to the plane. Before boarding, each person was given a meal by the Aeronautical Affairs Commission, which contained a small package of chocolate, a package of biscuits, a small package of dried beef, and a small package of [missing text].</p>
<p>In Nanjing, the team in charge of this air transport was Zhang Guangming's team. This man was tall and thin like the American star, Jorah, and spoke Mandarin with a northeastern accent. Every day from morning to dusk, he was in the radio station, the Ming Palace Airport control tower, and the air transport team headquarters, using the phone to arrange and command. He had been wounded in a battle with Japanese planes in Guide. When he parachuted down, Japanese planes strafed his parachute and shot at him. After recovering from his injuries, he had spent three years guarding the border in Xinjiang. He loved riding horses and hunting. He rode along the Yili River for twelve days without dismounting. His energy was so abundant. After the victory last summer, he had been engaged in air transport in Xinjiang for a long time. He was a capable assistant to Captain Yi Fun.</p>
<p>Although the weather in Beijing and Chongqing during the Aeronautical Affairs Commission's air transport in April was sometimes unpredictable, no danger ever occurred. In total, more than 4,000 capital return personnel were transported to the capital in twenty days.</p>
<p>Passing Resolutions and Both Nanjing Radio Stations Were the Busiest Units in This Capital Return Air Transport. Wang Yangzhou, the chief mechanic at the Chongqing station, made sure that the motors never broke down. The two airports were especially busy. Yang Jian, the station chief of Ming Palace Airport, reduced his sleeping time by half. This peacetime busyness can train the air force's young men's sense of responsibility. In the future, when there are large-scale air transport and troop transfers, this training will be equivalent to a rehearsal.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Capital Return Personnel</p>
<p>Mayor Ma Chao has lived a hard life with the people of Chongqing in Chongqing for eight years. He is an old man of about sixty who deeply understands the feelings and needs of those returning to the capital. Although prices in Beijing are lower than in Shanghai, the worthlessness of the legal tender is still the same as it was in Chongqing. Therefore, this master of Nanjing could not satisfy the capital return personnel with the three items of clothing, food, and housing. This major problem of life and economy does not seem to be solved by a mayor alone. If everyone's life is prosperous and the social economy is based on and conforms to the "Principle of People's Livelihood," then our country's level will be high enough. Apart from clothing, food, and housing, some of the municipal administration within the scope of the municipal government that should be developed and reformed have made very rapid progress. In Nanjing, the price of hotel rooms is currently only between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan. Small hotels are also comfortable for 1,000 yuan a day. This is a phenomenon that no other city has. In terms of the catering industry, a 500-yuan restaurant can satisfy hunger and [missing text]. In terms of transportation, the thousands of potholes on Zhongshan Road and Taiping Road have been filled with asphalt. Whether you take a rickshaw or ride a bicycle, you don't have to detour to avoid the bumps in the potholes on any main road. In terms of transportation, the small trains in Beijing travel between Xiaguan and the city center, Gulou and Confucius Temple, to outside Zhonghua Gate. More than 100,000 passengers ride every day. It can be said that it is the most convenient public tool. The fees are as low as long-distance railway [missing text]. Although the prices of water, electricity, and coal are expensive, there have never been any water or power outages. Although garbage removal and the demolition of damaged houses were carried out by [missing text] Japanese [missing text] officials, some of the municipal government staff also put in a lot of effort. In addition to wearing glasses to approve official documents in the office every day, the sixty-year-old Mayor Ma often travels east and west by car to the work site to supervise and direct himself. An Air Force captain who had just arrived in Nanjing once did not know that the suburban road from Guanghua Gate to Dajiaochang was being renovated. He drove a jeep from the city out of Guanghua Gate to Dajiaochang. At Guanghua Gate, a sturdy old man in a suit waved a red flag to stop his jeep, shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"The road surface is not dry from this road renovation, you should take the Zhonghua Gate road."</p>
<p>Later, the military police told him that this was the mayor, and he admired him infinitely in his heart. What is even more admirable is that the mayor supervised the construction and repaired the long road from Dajiaochang Airport to Guanghua Gate in twenty days. He was like fighting a war, wherever it was urgent, he placed himself in that place.</p>
<p>New Nanjing Scenery</p>
<p>In Nanjing, Xuanwu Lake outside Xuanwu Gate is a landscape painting that can be compared with the mausoleum. The entire energy of the Nanjing Municipal Garden Management Office is focused on the renovation of Xuanwu Lake Park. Not only the Americans who are good at appreciating natural beauty say that the scenery of Xuanwu Lake is a lake area that they have not found in those combat areas that they have run all over the earth, but even the Sichuanese capital return personnel whose enjoyment power has been numbed by war life also praised it endlessly.</p>
<p>The spring flowers and plants along Xuanwu Lake are now moving towards summer. The cherries are ripe, the willow branches are lush, and the voices of the boat girls welcoming guests are endless: "Do you want to paddle a small boat?"</p>
<p>The spring water is full on the lake, and the green reeds on the shore are budding and growing. With three days of touring the lake after the war-numbed mind, you can be sure to restore your original spirit. In order to increase the food supply on the lake and provide convenience to tourists, the Garden Management Office [missing text]</p>
<p>In order to enable the lake people to express the spirit and [missing text] of the citizens of the capital, Mayor Ma's wife ran a tutoring school in the heart of the lake park. For ten years, Mayor Ma's wife has always loved to engage in social education. The girls who follow her in doing things can become outstanding social welfare or social education leaders in a few years. Her requirements for doing things are quite high. The girls who follow Ma's wife often say: "Although the madam is kind, she is strict and serious in doing things, almost like a man."</p>
<p>Naturally, there is still much work to be done in welcoming the capital return personnel in Nanjing, but the greatest efforts have been made, and they have already been clearly demonstrated. The best municipal administration is still praised by the general public as Vienna, the capital of Austria under the rule of the Social Democratic Party during the First European War. I believe that Nanjing is the capital of the new China of the Three Principles of the People, and it will definitely take care of the calls and demands of the public life, pay attention to production, save consumption, and seek the prosperity of the people's lives.

<p>Commemorative Publication for the Return of the National Government to the Capital, Part 2</p>
<h3>Four Hours in the Sky Over Beijing and Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhao Haosheng, Air Traffic Report from Nanjing</p>
<p>Chongqing! Wave goodbye to you, the sacred city of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Please bring a vigorous fighting spirit to Nanjing.</p>
<p>After the closing of the Political Participation Council, Chongqing was filled with calls for the return to the capital. The imminent convening of the National Assembly made the political "migratory birds" - the reporters - eager to rush to Nanjing. The Central Propaganda Department asked the China National Aviation Corporation to allocate a [missing text] to the reporters who had registered one after another. Under the circumstances that "we can leave in two or three days," preparations began on the 11th, until the 16th when we received the news that we were definitely leaving the next day.</p>
<p>We were really leaving Chongqing like this. Emotionally, I felt a little rushed, a little at a loss. Speaking of life in Chongqing, although it made people feel a little tired, the city that was closely connected with our eight years of suffering and fighting life was actually unspeakably heavy and reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Everyone who leaves Chongqing to go to "the lower reaches of the Yangtze River" has considered the comparison of prices between the two places. Prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area are higher than in Chongqing, and it is best to buy some daily necessities in Chongqing. But another theory is that although prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area are expensive, the goods are better than those in Chongqing, so it is better to buy them "down there." For poor civil servants, the measure of value between a pair of leather shoes, a towel, and ten or twenty thousand yuan is also painstaking.</p>
<h3>Saying a Fond Farewell to the Glorious Land</h3>
<p>To prepare luggage, to attend farewell dinners and say goodbyes, several days were spent busily. Actually, this parting wasn't too serious between friends, because everyone was leaving within the next ten days or a month. At the banquets, everyone raised their chopsticks and toasted, simply saying "See you in Nanjing!"</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the sixteenth, sending luggage to be weighed, one colleague actually wore five Western suits, three shirts, two coats, almost wearing five ties. Actually, the situation at the weighing station wasn't that serious because it was a large transport plane with a large load capacity. Beyond fifteen kilograms, a tolerance of one or two kilograms was allowed.</p>
<p>That day, passengers on a special plane from the Central Party Headquarters were also having their luggage weighed at the same time. I caught a ride back in their car. A woman in the car was holding a baby less than a year old. Because the weather was hot, the baby was completely naked, innocently smiling at the people in the car. Two clean, bright little teeth had already grown in that wide-open little mouth. This adorable baby made people unable to resist wanting to caress and tease him. The mother was very happy to introduce him to everyone, calling him "Xiao Yu." This was a name full of commemorative significance and immediately became the topic of conversation. The mother even let everyone look at the two little teeth in his mouth and pointed out, "His third tooth is already peeking out." Then someone said, "By the time he gets to Nanjing, the third tooth will have grown in." Everyone in the car laughed. "Xiao Yu's" third tooth represented the joy of so many people!</p>
<p>The night before departure, myself and my friends kept reminding each other to go to bed early, but the night before departure, as usual, it's not easy to fall asleep. After dinner, in order to inform a friend who was taking our car to the airport about the departure time, I lingered on Linsen Road for a long time. I cherished and paid close attention to every section of road I walked on. I almost wanted to touch every brick of the surrounding buildings. Tonight, even the most annoying high slopes became flat, and even the most disgusting sewage on the roadside became less irritating. Turning from Linsen Road onto Guofu Road, the stately hall of the National Government under the moonlight appeared magnificent and solemn. The lights under the high eaves were bright, and the giant pillars in front stood firm. This reminded me of the various "past events" during the Political Consultative Conference three months ago and the demonstrations on Daoli a month ago for the Northeast problem. Recollection is not a regressive emotion. Remembering these many changes and melting them with emotion will make you take life more seriously. When I took a detour to Shangqingsi on my way back to the newspaper office, it was almost eleven o'clock. The streets were very deserted. I walked slowly on the sidewalk, forcefully hitting the street with my leather shoes. A heavy echo came from afar. I wanted to quietly listen to the sounds of this mountain city one more time. I wanted to bid a final, fond farewell to this glorious land.</p>
<h3>Flying Over the Three Gorges, Overlooking the Panoramic View of the Lovely Shu River</h3>
<p>The car had already taken us to the airport to wait. At half-past eleven, the plane came. Everyone hurriedly carried their luggage onto the plane. It was a C46 large transport plane. The forty-odd of us sat inside, very comfortably. There were no seats, so we sat on our luggage. The people from the company counted the number of people. Yesterday, a reporter from the "Business Daily" didn't arrive. At the time, someone who was sending his wife onto the plane temporarily filled in. Today, the "Business Daily" reporter came, and the gentleman who had temporarily filled in also got on the plane, so there was one extra person. The company wanted the gentleman who had temporarily filled in to get off. He pleaded, "Now that I'm already on, please be lenient!" Also, his wife and child needed him to take care of them. The company people refused. Finally, everyone unanimously asked him to consider the safety of the entire group. Only then did he get off. He said goodbye to his wife in a hurry. The child saw his father getting off and cried anxiously. The temporary separation of reunited couples is a common tragedy and comedy in the rear area. The wife being able to leave first was actually fortunate amidst misfortune.</p>
<p>The plane didn't start for a long time. The metal cabin was scorching hot from the blazing sun. The people sitting inside felt like they were in an oven. Some people, afraid of being cold at high altitude after takeoff, wore a lot of clothes, which made them sweat even more.</p>
<p>Finally, the engine started, but it circled once on the airport ground and then turned back. The plane door was reopened. The pilot said that there was a problem with the engine.</p>
<p>The engine was still being repaired at two o'clock. If we took off again, we would probably only be able to make it to Hankou to land. A colleague from Hubei was already preparing to get off at Hankou. Everyone was quite interested in the possibility of visiting Wuhan. At three o'clock, the repairs were completed. Before departure, the pilot announced that we would definitely be able to land in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Expresses Sentiments on Returning to the Capital: Rebuilding the Old Land, Building a New China</h3>
<p>When Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, visited this newspaper office on the afternoon of the thirtieth of last month, this reporter asked him for his thoughts on the National Government returning to the capital. Secretary-General Wu first said: "The victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the government to the capital are one of the most significant events in our country's history. The people of the whole country should also be joyfully encouraged, deeply celebrating the safety of our land. However, during the nation-building period from now on, we should still uphold the wartime spirit of the soldiers shedding blood and the people sweating, rebuilding the old land and building a new China. The determination of our party and government to seek peaceful unification and solidarity and to return the government to the people and implement constitutionalism is completely the same as the people's urgent desire." Secretary-General Wu then spoke about his feelings about leaving Chongqing, saying: "Having lived in Chongqing for eight years during the war, when I said goodbye yesterday morning, I witnessed the beautiful scenery of the Jialing River and the mountains, forests, and vegetation, and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the friendship of the people of Chongqing. What is especially unforgettable is that during the major air raids by enemy planes in Chongqing, the Chongqing citizens, police, firefighters, and the rescue teams participated in by our party comrades worked hard regardless of all dangers. At that time, we were fortunate to rely on the stonemasons who dug air-raid shelters day and night, working hard to reduce the losses of the people. Until shortly after the victory, we still seemed to be able to hear the shouts of the stonemasons, the sound of stone-cutting, and the sound of gunpowder explosions. Also, the workers in the factories near Chongqing and the farmers in Sichuan manufactured weapons in mountain caves or increased grain production in the fields during the war. Their contributions to the War of Resistance were extremely important. We also remember them very much. All these compatriots who worked hard in the War of Resistance are sufficient to represent the spirit of our nation's ancestors pioneering and forging ahead. Based on this spirit, we believe that the task of promoting the peaceful unification and solidarity of our country and building a new China will definitely be successful. We should especially have this confidence and perseverance."</p>
<p>The worries caused by leaving Chongqing were dispelled by the pleasant sound of the engine. The plane soared into the sky, bringing people back into the emotion of farewell. The plane was traveling in the clear sky, and everyone was leaning against the windows to bid a final farewell to Chongqing.</p>
<p>That winding and shining thing in the mountains is the Jialing River. That which is always appearing and disappearing under the plane is the Yangtze River. The highway is like a long golden, endless ribbon. The mountain caves, Qingmuguan, and Beipei look like small black dots. "Look! Look!" A mother sitting next to me dragged her child to the window and pointed, "There, in the distance, is Chongqing. Wave to her! Say goodbye to her!" The child's big eyes were illuminated by the sunlight shining through the window, making them even brighter. The dark little pupils were moving extremely quickly. He excitedly looked down, waving his small hand and shouting in response to his mother's call, "Bye! Bye!"</p>
<p>This time, it was a real farewell to Chongqing. Chongqing, she buried so many unforgettable memories for people. Chongqing, it is a place that has been connected to us by flesh and blood for eight years. Eight years, more than two thousand nine hundred days! I, a small life, was born here, and many children grew up here. Many relatives who should not have died died here. So much sweetness and bitterness that had never been experienced before was experienced here. Chongqing, every Chinese person will remember you forever, and will forever miss you, Chongqing! You will always be brilliant in the memories of millions of people, Chongqing! You will be as immortal as China's victorious War of Resistance!</p>
<p>Emotions were rolling with the sound of the engine, drifting with the flowing clouds in the sky, slowly congealing into an indistinguishable blur, slowly being blown farther and farther away by the clear, cold wind.</p>
<p>The plane was traveling extremely smoothly. In the cabin, some were eating oranges, some were reading, and some were lying on their luggage, pretending to sleep. The reporter and a friend leaned against the window, waiting to see the plane pass over the Three Gorges.</p>
<p>Calculating the time, it should be reaching the skies above the Three Gorges. The airflow began to change, and the plane shook slightly. Looking down at the plane's wings, there was a vast expanse of even larger overlapping mountains. The Yangtze River rolled into the mountains, and could not be seen at all. The so-called Twelve Peaks of Wushan are probably those stacked mountain peaks shaped like steamed buns below! The plane flying over the Three Gorges made people not feel the "desolate and gloomy atmosphere of Wushan and Wuxia," and could not see the poetic scene of "a solitary city on the river, the setting sun slanting." The progress of science has also expanded people's scope of appreciation of nature. If Du Fu were alive, his "Eight Autumn Meditations" could also be rewritten, adding some new content.</p>
<p>From the time it flew above the ground, within the Three Gorges, there were extremely regular mountain ranges accompanied by the Yangtze River. The scenery of "the waters of the Shu River are green, and the mountains of Shu are green" can also be roughly appreciated on the plane. Outside the Three Gorges, looking east along the Yangtze River, there is a vast plain. Here, the Yangtze River seems to have broken free from the shackles of the Three Gorges, winding happily on the plain. In addition to the Yangtze River, there are also more intersecting rivers and large lakes here. The entire terrain outside the Three Gorges is open and elegant, like the face of an oriental beauty with gentle curves and light makeup, unlike the overlapping mountains of the Sichuan terrain, like the high nose and protruding forehead of a Westerner.</p>
<p>Taking off at 3:15, when we arrived near Wuhan, the sun was already setting. The shadows of night slowly flew into the plane from outside the window. The lights in the cabin were turned on. The plane began to fly at night. The engine was humming evenly and regularly. It was still traveling very smoothly in the night sky.</p>
<p>At 7:20, the door of the cockpit in front opened. A radio operator came out and passed a slip of paper to everyone to read: "Arriving in Nanjing in thirty minutes. Remain seated during landing." At this time, moonlight shone in from the plane window. Looking out the window, the moon was clear and bright. The plane seemed to be gliding in a milky white sea, truly having a feeling of "clearness inside and out." Occasionally, we could still see a little light from the burning of mountain wildfires. Twenty minutes later, someone shouted that the lights of Nanjing were in sight.</p>
<h3>The Plane Quietly Landed, Seeing the Standing, Luminous Figure</h3>
<p>Like a pattern adorned with pearls, like many stars plucked from the sky and planted on the ground, electric lights formed a square chessboard-like thing. In the middle were lines woven from red lights, imagining that should be a series of streets. The plane circled in the sky, and the pearl-adorned pattern spun around. The plane descended layer by layer like going down stairs. The pattern became brighter and brighter, and larger and larger. When it was close to the airport in the sky, the wings of the plane were emitting radio signals, and the lights on the left and right of the engine were also turned on. In a way that people did not feel, it had already landed on the ground.</p>
<p>The first person to open the cabin door after the plane stopped was a porter wearing a numbered uniform. He greeted us with a Nanjing accent. Looking at his watch, it was exactly 7:50. Four hours and thirty-five minutes from Chongqing. Hearing the sounds of Nanjing!</p>
<p>Carrying my luggage, I came out and looked around on the escalator. It was a boundless expanse of blue. While I was at a loss, I suddenly heard a familiar voice shouting, "Zhao Da!" I walked down, stepped on the land of Nanjing, and shook a friend's hand. I was so happy that I wanted to hug my friend and jump up. I was so excited that I really wanted to bend down and kiss the land of this capital!</p>
<p>It was still the old Zhu speaking that incomprehensible Zhejiang dialect, telling me that he had been waiting at the airport for eight hours. I got into the car he had driven and drove towards the city. The road was unimaginably bad. From Dajiaochang into Zhonghuamen, to Zhonghua Road, I watched every single thing I could see. There were not many pedestrians on the street. Many shops had already closed. From Zhonghua Road to Road, the situation was the same. When we got to Zhongshan Road, we had already entered the city center area. The scene was still deserted. When the car passed the statue of the Father of the Nation in the central square at the intersection of Streets, Old Zhu told me that when President Chiang triumphedantly returned to Nanjing, he had gotten out of the car here to pay his respects to the statue. That night, I saw that standing, luminous figure in the darkness, feeling an extremely solemn emotion rising in my heart. As the car passed her, I cheered in my heart to this statue symbolizing infinite sublime glory!</p>
<p>Based on the city and the many places I saw, the feeling that Nanjing gave me was exceptionally desolate. The large city made people feel an emptiness that . Tonight I am writing at my desk, praying in my heart that the people abandon all that is bad, and bring to Nanjing the combatant, thriving spirit cultivated in Chongqing for eight years!

<h3>The Return of the National Government to the Capital and China's New Birth</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunyi</p>
<p>After eight years of long-term resistance, Chairman Chiang and the National Government, who led this nation's historical war, have now triumphantly returned to the capital. What a meaningful grand event this is in the history of the Chinese nation! Eight years ago, the arrogance of the Japanese invaders in East Asia was at its peak, and they were intensifying their aggression against us step by step, attempting to eliminate our nation's survival, to conquer China and achieve "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity," and "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," in order to rule the entire world. We raised the banner of resistance with a backward industrial production and poorly equipped military, and how difficult our situation was at that time. Domestically, there was no heavy industry base to support long-term warfare, transportation was inconvenient, military transport was difficult, and social organization was loose. Internationally, although the great powers expressed sympathy, their supply of military fire and resources to Japan was as if the war did not exist, or they proclaimed to uphold justice while secretly colluding with the enemy. All of these were unfavorable to our independent resistance. However, we independently resisted the Japanese invaders for as long as four years. Only when the Japanese invaders were trapped deeper and deeper in the mire of China did the attack on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the Pacific War occur. This allowed us to wait for the Allied nations, from our country's independent resistance to the United Nations' joint resistance. Now, the Japanese invaders have surrendered and submitted, and the leader and government that led our national struggle have returned to Nanjing amidst the sound of triumph. This is truly a great event that should be recorded in detail in the history of the Chinese nation. As Chairman Chiang's announcement says, this Sino-Japanese war was a total competition of national power between the two nations. In this historical struggle, Japan failed, and China has returned to its rightful position in East Asia. The one who overcame all kinds of difficulties with firm will and ultimately enabled us to achieve victory is our great leader, the wise Chairman Chiang, who seems to be the savior of our nation. Now that the National Government has triumphantly returned to Nanjing, we must first express our infinite respect for Chairman Chiang, who led us to victory. Regarding the soldiers and civilians who died in this national struggle, remembering the intensity of their deaths, we also sincerely express our respect. It is because of their deaths that we have our lives.</p>
<p>This Sino-Japanese War has liquidated Japan's aggression against us for the past fifty years, and restored our country's leading position in East Asia. China was originally the only great power leading East Asia. After the Japanese Restoration, it actively expanded its national power, and in the Jiawu War, our country's leading position in East Asia began to waver. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan became the leader of East Asia, joining the ranks of the great powers. This was an invasion of us, with steps intensifying. After the Xinhai Revolution, Japan, seeing that a strong and unified China conflicted with its attempt to rule and conquer China, did its best to carry out a movement to divide China, colluding with warlord separatist forces in an attempt to prevent China's strong unification. The progress of the National Revolution encountered many setbacks because of Japan's obstruction. Japan was an obstacle to the completion of our National Revolution, because the purpose of the National Revolution was to establish a strong and unified China, which conflicted with Japan's intentions. Therefore, when the armed forces of the National Revolution settled in the Jiangnan Yangtze River basin and headed north to North China, there was the so-called "Jinan Incident." At the time of the Northeastern Flag Replacement and national unification, there was the "Shenyang Incident" and the establishment of "Manchukuo." All of these actions were contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. In order to complete the National Revolution and implement the construction of the Three Principles of the People, China had to stop Japan's aggression. In order to ensure its leading position in East Asia and to realize its dream of "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," Japan had to conquer China. The Sino-Japanese relationship in the past fifty years is actually a history of Japan's aggression against China. The total competition between the two nations was manifested in this Sino-Japanese War. Due to the victory of the Resistance War, China wiped out the shame of the past fifty years and restored its past glory.</p>
<p>Now, this historically significant national struggle has ended gloriously. From now on, we will embark on the road of national construction, and China will begin to have its new birth. There are many aspects to national construction, such as material construction and psychological construction. Under material construction, there can also be transportation construction and production construction. However, the most important thing in national construction is to build people. The new birth of the nation must be based on the new birth of the people. The nation is originally a collection of countless people, countless individuals. To build a nation without first building up individuals with a new birth is like building a high-rise building on the beach, without a solid foundation. Only when individuals have a new birth can the nation have a new birth, and national construction can have a solid foundation. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang discussed national construction in his book "China's Destiny," he first mentioned ethical construction and psychological construction. We must have a new spiritual life in order to enjoy a new material life. At the present time when the nation is entering the stage of national construction, individual construction cannot be ignored. Although we have won this Resistance War, in this war, the general national morality of our country has deteriorated greatly. This is manifested in all aspects of life: the decline of private life, the competition for hypocrisy, deception, and plunder becoming a common practice, and the repeated occurrence of corruption cases, which have recently become more severe, from secretly taking and plundering to openly swindling and robbing. All of these show the bankruptcy of national morality. In response to the current malpractices, Chairman Chiang loudly called for the promotion of the New Life Movement, urging the people to know etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame, and to distinguish right from wrong. However, what has been the result in the past ten years? Which one of us should not feel ashamed towards Chairman Chiang? With this low level of morality, how can we truly complete the great cause of national construction? Facing the historical stage of national construction, all of our people should truly know justice and be clear about integrity and shame, and "knowing" and "being clear" are not enough; we must practice it personally, reform our faces and wash our hearts, each of us determined that the "old self" has already died yesterday, and the "new self" is born today, thoroughly reforming our words and deeds, and each of us has a new awakening of personal self, then the new birth of the Chinese nation can have hope.</p>
<p>The reason for the decline of national morality is not simple, and the main reason is the abandonment of traditional values and the failure to cherish them. Although the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial rule of thousands of years, it was not the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the national ideological traditions of our country for thousands of years, but the so-called May Fourth Movement after the Xinhai Revolution. Under the slogan of "Down with the Confucius Family Store," our inherent traditions, especially our inherent ethical traditions, were despised. As the trend developed thereafter, ethical values lost their standards, and personal behavior was no longer subject to social sanctions. When the war broke out, the difficulties of wartime life led to a further decline in moral standards, and recently, it has become even worse. For the sake of national construction, we must stop this downward trend. Although we are called one of the five great powers, our material production capacity is not as good as others, and we should catch up. But as a land of etiquette and righteousness with a cultural history of five thousand years, if national morality continues to decline without thinking of revitalizing, how can we face those "barbaric lands" that we despise? In the great cause of national construction, we should catch up in material construction, and we should also pay attention to psychological construction and ethical construction. We must re-establish moral standards, so that social order can be maintained, and national construction efforts will not be wasted.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at Britain and the United States, which have reached an advanced level in material construction, and how much they value spiritual and moral life. Zhu Jiaxiang, a special correspondent of Zhongbao stationed in New York, said in his communication: "The material life of the United States can be said to have reached its peak. Especially in this world's largest city, the extravagance and luxury are unparalleled in the world. More than seven million residents are influenced by what they see and hear. The temptation of sensuality and the pursuit of material things are undoubtedly intense. But in this environment where money is omnipotent and material things are prosperous, strangely, they still pay attention to spiritual life, they still pursue religious comfort. When material things are satisfied, they do not forget the spirit. Although they have material life, they do not despise spiritual life, and this is closely related to the maintenance and development of their country and society." He also said: "Now we have to ask again, what role do their religious beliefs play in their worldly human hearts? This question is of course not easy to answer... But according to the comments of most church people and impartial people, if this country has no religious beliefs, then human desires will be rampant. Now there are these unique social education and training institutions (…holding high the torch of morality, acting as a pillar in the middle stream, the moral standards of this country are thus actively maintained. For example, in terms of social atmosphere, although the relationship between men and women is casual, there is still public opinion supervision controlled by the church; it is very difficult for a person to do something if they have a moral defect. …In fact, this religious force is still the backbone of the moral force of this country. They usually speak in a completely democratic and free way based on their religious beliefs, leading the masses and influencing people's hearts, directly influencing the country's policies, and therefore their impact is significant. At this time of chaos in the world, the United States has defeated the enemy with its strong material strength, and now it still wants to have compassion and save the world, and to vigorously establish justice. We cannot deny that this great moral force is mainly due to religion."</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation in China, what is it like? We despise and do not cherish our traditional moral laws. We do not learn and adopt the religious beliefs and religious life of Americans, in other words, the spiritual life of Americans. Our material production capacity is far inferior to that of the United States, but our people want to imitate Americans in everything in their enjoyment of material life. The result of the interaction of these factors is the gradual decline of national morality. The great cause of national construction emphasizes both material and spiritual things. We cannot pay attention to material construction and ignore spiritual construction. The most important thing in spiritual construction is the complete renewal of individuals; only with the new birth of individuals can there be the new birth of the nation.</p>

<h3>A Review of the National Government's Move to the Capital</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Data Room</p>
<p>After the "August 13th" Incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the heroic soldiers who defended Shanghai fought bloody battles for more than three months. Finally, due to strategic reasons, they retreated from the vicinity of Shanghai. From that time on, the enemy, with a cruel and brutal attitude, pressed towards our capital step by step. Soon, the flames of war spread to the outskirts of the capital. However, our government authorities had long been determined to resist to the end. Therefore, from mid-November, the ministries and departments of the National Government had begun to prepare for internal relocation. For the convenience of administration, all five Yuan of the National Government moved to Chongqing, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Health Department moved to Hankou, the Ministry of Transportation moved to Changsha, and the military agencies remained in Nanjing.</p>
<p>On November 20, the National Government formally issued a declaration of moving to Chongqing. This is a document of great significance. The full text is reproduced below:</p>
<p>"Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Tianjin and Beiping have fallen, and the war has spread. The National Government, in view of the endless aggression of the violent Japanese, has decided to resist and defend ourselves. The people of the whole country share the same hatred of the enemy, and all officers and soldiers are loyal and courageous. In the provinces that have been invaded, there have been extremely rapid struggles and extremely heroic sacrifices. In the corner of Shanghai, the resistance war has lasted for three months. Officers and soldiers from all over the country have rushed to the rescue when they heard the call, arriving in the evening when ordered in the morning. They have built trenches with their flesh and blood on the front line, and there is no retreat in death. The violent Japanese have used the power of their naval, land, and air forces to launch continuous attacks. Although the positions have turned to ashes, the morale of the army is as firm as gold and stone. Their courage in the face of battle and the intensity of their deaths are enough to show the spirit of national independence and lay the foundation for the rejuvenation of China. Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and unscrupulous, sending troops westward to force our capital. Their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into a covenant under the city. However, it is not known that since our country decided to resist and defend ourselves, we have deeply known that this is the last moment. For the sake of the country's life, for the sake of national personality, for the sake of international justice and world peace, there is no room for surrender. All those with blood and qi are determined to rather be a broken piece of jade than a whole tile. The National Government has moved to Chongqing today in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and carry out long-term resistance. From now on, we will engage in a more lasting battle on the largest scale. With the multitude of the Chinese people and the breadth of the land, everyone is determined to die, and their blood and land are condensed into one, and no violence can separate them; with the sympathy of the international community and the unity of the people, continuing the resistance war will surely achieve the goal of maintaining the survival and independence of the nation and the country. This is hereby declared, and we encourage each other! November 20, the 26th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Five days after the declaration of the National Government's move to the capital was issued, Chairman Chiang made an important speech, the main points of which were as follows:</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that justice will eventually triumph over power, and we will resist to the end to the last inch of land and the last person. This is our fixed policy. China intends to maintain its policy of resolute resistance. We will defend Nanjing, but we will do so from afar. The lives and property of foreigners should be protected. The rumor that Nanjing will be set on fire if it is in danger of falling into enemy hands is just a rumor."</p>
<p>In fact, when the declaration of moving the capital was issued, the government agencies had almost finished moving. All files and documents were safely moved out; all valuable equipment in the offices and factories was completely dismantled; hospitals, equipment, factory lathes, and various machines were all moved away. The city of Nanjing was left with only an empty shell. The public's mood was quite calm, with no signs of chaos or panic. The citizens were determined to resist to the end.</p>
<p>From the end of November, the heads of various government ministries, such as Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Kong Xiangxi, Wei Daoming, Duan Xipeng, Huang Jilu, Dai Chuanxian, and Ju Zheng, left Beijing one after another, took boats to Hankou, and stayed there temporarily. Chairman Lin took the Yong Sui warship through Yichang on the 22nd and arrived in Chongqing on the 26th. At that time, the people of Chongqing held a grand welcome meeting. Chairman Chiang remained in Nanjing, commanding calmly.</p>
<p>After the National Government moved to Chongqing, the ambassadors of various countries held a meeting to discuss the location of the embassies. As a result, it was decided to move to Hankou temporarily. Each embassy left a part of its staff in Nanjing to form an international committee to preside over the protection of foreigners. As a result, envoys from Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union arrived in Hankou one after another and continued to work in their respective consulates.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Military Affairs Commission, after the National Government moved west, hosted foreign residents and foreign reporters stationed in Beijing and announced that Nanjing would still be the capital of China. Civil affairs would be handled by Mayor Ma Chaojun, and Zhang would be responsible for maintaining law and order, and would do his best to protect the lives and property of foreigners.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance began to work in Hankou on the 26th. At the same time, the ministries and departments of the National Government decided to send one-fifth of their personnel to Sichuan. More than 500 personnel from the civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting offices arrived in Chongqing at the end of November. The agencies that moved to Chongqing began to work on December 1. At this point, the important western town of our country officially became the wartime capital.</p>
<p>However, at that time, the government's civil administration organization had actually been eliminated and replaced by a military administration organization. Chairman Chiang's headquarters was formed here. The number of personnel in the various Yuan and ministries has been reduced to a minimum. For the convenience of communication, the government agencies, in addition to staying in Hankou for temporary office work, also established offices in Guangdong Province. However, the military center had moved to Hunan Province, because there were railways and highways connecting Hankou, Nanchang, and the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Therefore, Hunan Province had become the base for our country's long-term resistance.</p>
<p>In late December, the flames of war spread westward, and Hankou was actively preparing for war. The government agencies stationed in Hankou continued to move inland when necessary. The temporary offices of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry moved to Chongqing, while the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Education moved to Changsha temporarily, and soon moved to Chongqing as well.</p>
<p>The National Government's move to Chongqing, which occupies an important page in the history of China's resistance against Japan, has now been completed.</p>
<h3>Record of the Triumphant Return to Nanjing: A New Page for the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>— By the Newspaper's Data Room</p>
<p>With the atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima, Japan, the Soviet Union's entry into the war on August 9, and China's heroic resistance, the Japanese Emperor finally announced Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15. When the news of the victory against Japan reached the ears of the officials and civilians of the wartime capital who had been in exile for eight years, waves of longing to return home surged in everyone's hearts, and the entire city of Chongqing was plunged into a frenzy of preparations for repatriation.</p>
<p>On the third day after the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Central News Agency first issued a statement from the Chinese government spokesperson to the press corps revealing that the National Government was planning to return to Nanjing in the shortest possible time. In mid-September, the authorities ordered all agencies to prepare for the return to the capital. In early December, the Executive Yuan specially dispatched Councilor Chen to Nanjing to survey the offices, furniture, and accommodations of the various ministries and commissions after their personnel arrived in the capital. As a result of this trip, it was decided that the Executive Yuan would temporarily use the old Ministry of Railways office building, and most of the ministries and commissions would continue to work at their original sites.</p>
<p>At the same time, in accordance with the instructions of the highest authorities, the Executive Yuan determined the specific measures for the government personnel's return to the capital: (1) The Executive Yuan and its affiliated ministries and commissions would dispatch a portion of their personnel to Beijing according to actual needs. The number of personnel for each ministry and commission would vary, with the most, such as the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Transportation, having 150 people, and the least, such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, having only 10 people, for a total of 1,500 people. (2) All personnel were required to arrive in Nanjing before December 15. (3) The Executive Yuan's regular meetings would be moved to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Starting on December 5, the government agencies' personnel returning to the capital began to bid farewell to China's wartime capital and embark on their triumphant return journey, returning to the capital they had been away from for eight years. They set off by land, water, and air. The air routes between Chongqing and Nanjing-Shanghai suspended passenger transport for ten days in order to rush the first batch of personnel returning to the capital. The first batch of returning personnel (including personnel from the Executive Yuan agencies), 150 people, first flew to Nanjing on the 12th. Sixty employees of the Ministry of Judicial Administration arrived in Nanjing on the 13th. In addition, the first batch of 400 personnel from the Executive Yuan traveled along the Yangtze River on the Huayuan transport ship, directly to the capital. Sixty employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs traveled to Beijing by plane and ship on the 14th. The first batch of personnel from the Executive Yuan agencies had all arrived by the 15th and officially began work on the 17th. More than 60 personnel from the Ministry of Education arrived in Beijing around the 20th. After that, government agencies' personnel continued to leave Chongqing for Beijing, and for a time, the roads between Beijing and Chongqing were filled with officials, brimming with vigor. By early February, the number of personnel who had returned to the capital had reached more than 1,000.</p>
<p>However, according to estimates from relevant parties, the number of public servants and their families belonging to the central agencies remaining in Chongqing who should return to the capital with the government often exceeded 430,000. As a result, the return to the capital faced two major difficulties: first, transportation was difficult, and the capacity of land, water, and air transport could not meet actual needs. According to reports from transportation authorities, the transportation volume in March, across all routes nationwide, was 10,000 people by air, of which approximately 4,500 people arrived in Shanghai and Nanjing. Land routes were divided into north and south lines, with the south line reaching Changsha and the north line reaching Baoji, before transferring to Beijing, with a capacity of 20,000 passengers. Water transport was unable to directly reach Hankou, so 8,400 people were transported in the Yichang-Chongqing section. At this rate, it would take a year to transport 400,000 people. In addition to strengthening air transport capacity, the authorities had to restrict the allocation of flight seats, and it was decided to prioritize air transport for approximately 1,000 representatives of the National Assembly and councilors, as well as 4,200 personnel from central party and government agencies. The flight seat allocation was as follows: 500 people from the Central Party Headquarters, 100 people from the Supreme National Defense Council, 280 people from the Office of the President's Civil Affairs and Accounting Office, 120 people from the Office of the President's Military Affairs, 200 people from the Youth League, 600 people from the Legislative Yuan, 120 people from the Judicial Yuan, 250 people from the Examination Yuan, 120 people from the Control Yuan, 1,700 people from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Transportation, Agriculture and Forestry, and Food, as well as personnel from diplomatic missions. Other ordinary personnel returning to the capital would inevitably be slightly restricted.</p>
<p>The second difficulty in returning to the capital was the housing problem for the returning personnel. According to rough estimates, there was a shortage of approximately 28,000 buildings for government agencies' office buildings and residences for public servants' families in Nanjing. To remedy this, the government has ordered the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 7 billion yuan for the construction of houses. In addition, the government has ordered 1,700 prefabricated houses from the United States. Before the prefabricated houses were fully delivered, each agency was responsible for its own office buildings in Beijing, and employees' families would temporarily remain in Chongqing. If they needed to go to Beijing first, they would be responsible for finding their own housing.</p>
<p>In late February, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the "Measures for the Return of Central Party and Government Agencies from Chongqing to the Capital," the main points of which were as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regulations for personnel returning to the capital from government agencies: (1) The number of employees is limited to those currently employed and cannot exceed the number budgeted for this year. (2) Employees' dependents are limited to spouses and direct relatives. (3) On average, each employee can bring three dependents, and each worker can bring one dependent. (4) For civil servants of each agency who died in Chongqing, if their dependents have not taken a position in other agencies and need to return to the capital, the original agency will handle the return procedures.</p>
<p>(B) Regulations for public property: Each agency will handle its own public property, limited to 100 kilograms per employee.</p>
<p>(C) Regulations for employees' luggage: Each employee and their dependents are allowed 100 kilograms, and each worker and their dependents are allowed 50 kilograms.</p>
<p>(D) Budgetary estimates: (1) The cost of transportation for personnel traveling from Chongqing to Beijing, including loading and unloading at wharves and transportation along the way, will be calculated based on actual expenses and handled by each agency. (2) The cost of ship tickets and meals is estimated at an average of 120,000 yuan per person. (3) 20,000 yuan per 100 kilograms. (4) The cost of transporting public and private property from Chongqing to Beijing, including all expenses, is estimated at 150,000 yuan per ton. (5) The cost of purchasing equipment for each agency after returning to the capital is estimated at 100,000 yuan per employee and 30,000 yuan per worker.</p>
<p>(E) Regulations for subsidies for employees returning to the capital: (1) 400,000 yuan for each special grade, 350,000 yuan for each senior grade, 300,000 yuan for each recommended grade, 250,000 yuan for each appointed grade, and 150,000 yuan for each employee. 80,000 yuan for each worker. Agencies that do not return to the capital with employees and workers will be given three months' severance pay.</p>
<p>(F) Central agencies outside of Chongqing that move back to the capital, and central agencies that move from Chongqing to other locations outside of the capital, will be handled in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<p>At this point, the National Government's return to the capital entered the stage of concrete realization.</p>
<h3>The Peak of the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, the practical stage of the National Government's return to the capital began on April 25. Most of the Executive Yuan's staff had arrived in Nanjing, and two-thirds of the number of personnel returning to the capital from the various departments and agencies of the Yuan had arrived and had begun working in Beijing.</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender in August, the offices of the Yuan's departments and committees in Beijing had only been for receiving and dispatching correspondence. But by April 25, it had completely changed and become the nerve center of the military and political administration. Not only were government officials intensifying their air travel to return to the capital, but leaders of various parties were also preparing to come to Beijing.</p>
<p>The National Government building was brilliantly restored and renovated. The National Government's construction project was divided into three parts: the first part, the office building, including the President's office and the Civil Affairs Office, would be completed immediately. The second part, the library building, including the office of the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials, the library, and the third part, the printing bureau and printing factory, would be completed by the end of April. The National Government's site had been occupied by the puppet Reformed Government, the puppet Executive Yuan, the puppet Control Yuan, the puppet Legislative Yuan, the puppet Examination Yuan, and the puppet Ministry of Personnel during the occupation. One of the dining halls had been destroyed by fire, and the entire building had not been repaired for eight years, resulting in weeds growing on the roof and leaks whenever it rained. Now, the renovation is gradually restoring it to its former appearance (Note: The organization of the National Government: the Civil Affairs Office, under which are the Bureau of Political Affairs (added in early October last year), the Printing Bureau, the Document Bureau, and the Personnel Office. The Military Affairs Office, under which is the Bureau of Military Affairs (added in early October last year). The General Affairs Bureau and the Bureau of Ceremonies. The Accounting Office, under which are the Accounting Bureau, the Statistics Bureau, and the Budget Bureau, as well as two independent directly affiliated organizations: the Political Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Audit Committee).</p>
<p>The work of returning to the capital becomes more urgent every day. By around April 20, an average of half of the government officials had already gone to Beijing. The Executive Yuan began working on the 25th, and the other agencies began working on the 28th.</p>
<p>One of the most inspiring pieces of news amidst the hurried return to the capital was that President Chiang, who led the nation in the heroic resistance against Japan, would soon return in glory to the capital to preside over the return to the capital. The people of the wartime capital felt deeply attached to President Chiang's leadership in the war of resistance, which led to the final victory, and his care for the citizens over the past eight years. Therefore, people from all walks of life initiated an unprecedented grand farewell meeting to express their solemn farewell and to ask President Chiang to give a speech to the citizens as a permanent memento. At the same time, the municipal government is planning to open a grand park from Zizui in Chaotianmen to the Minsheng Company area, with a bronze statue of President Chiang erected inside to commemorate President Chiang's great achievements in leading the national resistance against Japan in Chongqing.</p>
<p>On April 30, the National Government promulgated the Order for the Return to the Capital as follows:</p>
<p>"The National Government moved the capital to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [1937] in order to wage a prolonged war of resistance. For eight years, thanks to the loyal and brave soldiers who followed each other's footsteps and sacrificed heroically, the officials and civilians of the whole country endured hardships, struggled tenaciously, and fought alongside the Allied countries at sea and in the air, which eventually led to the surrender of the enemy and the completion of the long-cherished goal. Now that the national territory has been recovered and the country is complete, the responsibility of resisting the war is over, but the responsibility of building the country is heavier. The government has decided to triumphantly return to Nanjing on May 5 of this year to comfort the public's wishes. However, after the great war, the people's livelihood is difficult and the national strength is declining, so it is necessary to allow the people to rest and recover, strive for construction, and maintain the fruits of the war. It is hoped that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will be of one heart and one mind and work diligently, so that they will not betray the original intention of resisting the war and building the country and realize the mission of the Three People's Principles. Recalling these eight years, the enemy has penetrated deeply and suffered heavy losses. If it were not for relying on the vast people of western China and relying on their fertile land, how could we have laid the foundation for today's victory? Sichuan, known as the Land of Abundance in ancient times, is the source of national power. Chongqing, with its two rivers, controls the north and south, and occupies a strategic position. Therefore, it was able to survive the crisis and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the country will be eternally recorded in history and will never be erased. As we approach the return to the capital and look forward to Nanjing, we realize the importance of the relationship between Sichuan and Chongqing. The government issued an order in September of the 29th year [1940] to designate Chongqing as the wartime capital, and recently designated Sichuan as the national construction experiment zone. The government should adopt its system and promote its reputation and reality. The Executive Yuan should supervise the provincial and municipal governments to plan and implement actively, so that Sichuan will forever be the center of the country and a model for national construction. This is our hope. This order."</p>
<p>At the same time as the National Government promulgated the "Order for the Return to the Capital," Special Envoy Marshall departed for Beijing on a special plane. Special Envoy Marshall kept a low profile in Beijing and discussed various intelligence reports with his staff. CCP representative Zhou Enlai and others were scheduled to come to Beijing on the 3rd. Accompanying staff and telecommunications personnel arrived on the afternoon of the 2nd to arrange everything. Representatives of the Democratic League may come to Beijing on the 5th and have already sent people to Beijing to look for office and residential buildings. Although Marshal Marshall expressed regret that the negotiations in Chongqing did not yield results, he was still confident in overcoming the difficulties ahead.</p>
<p>Today, the officials and civilians of the whole country celebrate the grand ceremony of returning to the capital after the victory of the War of Resistance with enthusiastic feelings of triumph—the founding ceremony of a new China of peace, unification, democracy, strength and prosperity. (Xintang)</p>
<p>The capital's various sectors are rushing to build ceremonial archways to celebrate the National Government's return to the capital.</p>
<h3>An Anecdote About the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>— By the Newspaper's Data Room</p>
<p>With the victory of the War of Resistance, the issue of returning to the capital was immediately noticed by people and regarded as one of the preconditions for the development of national construction work in the future. By December of last year, the air in the wartime capital and Beiping was filled with talk of returning the capital to Beiping. In fact, it was not just talk, but there were several facts that could be used to support it:</p>
<p>(1) On December 15 of last year, the Central News Agency reported that the Beiping Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee had submitted a request to President Chiang to move the capital to Beiping.</p>
<p>(2) Huaibei Envoy Zhang Ji advocated building the capital in Beiping at a reception for journalists and hoped that the press would promote it more.</p>
<p>(3) According to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on December 20 of last year, government leaders recently held an informal vote, and the results showed that 92 percent of them favored building the capital in Beiping, and the national sentiment in favor of building the capital in Beiping was also very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>(4) According to a certain military and political official in Nanjing, after President Chiang inspected the recovered areas and returned to Chongqing, he had a very good impression of Beiping, and Allied personnel were particularly interested in the area. If Special Envoy Marshall's mediation of the CCP and KMT disputes was successful, the domestic problems could be solved. If so, then building the capital in Beiping might be realized soon.</p>
<p>(5) On April 1 of this year, at the 19th meeting of the National Political Council, Councilors He Jihong, Wang Puhan, and others requested the government to issue an order to establish the capital in Beiping. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>(6) Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin once told reporters informally that Beiping had a 70 percent chance of becoming China's future capital.</p>
<p>(7) At the same time, the United States was also deeply interested in China moving its political center to Beiping. They felt that after the completion of the new port built by the Japanese in Tianjin, the situation of Beijing and Tianjin for China was very similar to that of Washington and New York for the United States.</p>
<p>Under these expectations and promotions, the atmosphere of establishing the capital in Beiping gradually became stronger and seemed to be a real possibility. However, we have never heard the government officially announce anything about this matter. On the contrary, government spokesman Zhang Pingqun told reporters that the rumors that the government was now considering building the capital in Beiping were not true. At the same time, Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen also replied to foreign reporters' questions, saying that the capital of our country is still Nanjing, and we have not heard of the current consideration of establishing Beiping as the capital.</p>
<p>After that, the situation in the Northeast became increasingly urgent, and the talk of moving the capital to Beiping, which had been widely publicized for a while, subsided. At the same time, after the government decided to return to Nanjing, it made every effort to strengthen preparations for the return to the capital, using facts to prove the unreliability of the past "moving the capital to Beiping" theory. This can only be said to be an interlude in the National Government's return to the capital.</p>
