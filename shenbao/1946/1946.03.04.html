<h3>一條新聞殺害了一份日報　長春沒有鞭砲聲</h3>
<p>— 方仁寄</p>
<p>…本報東北航訊</p>
<p>先從第一個勝利以後過的舊年談起吧。眞的，並不像五個多月以前剛光復時所想像的那個過法，除夕無鞭砲，悄然度過，大家覺得「這年頭過得不够味」」不過，拿今年和以往十四年比較，畢竟有些不同，比方說，往年此日，得個人只能得到「配給」下來的那一點東西吃——四兩猪肉，一斤麵粉，半斤酒，兩隻蘋果，一隻橘子。而麵粉和猪肉只能包成水餃，一次就吃個精光，這樣，就算把最有興趣的舊年度過。而今年則可以自由買賣，只要有錢，要多就多，要啥有啥。</p>

<p>長春舊年情調，年貨攤子當然算是一個最顯著的象徵，而長春市上唯一的平民的交通工具——馬車，算是在年貨攤子之外，散布年景的使者。因爲年貨攤子的勢力範圍有限，而馬車，車身上都貼有一個紅方塊「福」字，兩旁並附帶有「車行千里路人馬保平安」的對聯，耀人眼簾，馳騁市區，把四馬路一帶的熱閙，帶到了市區的每一個角落。</p>

<p>長春現在共有三家報紙，都是四開的，一家呌長春日報，一家呌光明日報，一家呌大華日報。但一般現象，消息貧乏，而目前又無辦法求改進，所以到了長春的人，都不約而同的說：到了這裏，每個人只得變成了殘廢，不是聾子就是瞎子。</p>
<p>三家報紙當中，大華日報從一月三十一日起停刋，因該報在一月二十九日登了一則新聞，說是蘇軍緊急命令，即日起不准燃放鞭砲，如果有人放，被蘇軍發現時，當立即槍次，被中國警察發現時，則處以拘留罪，保甲長並須負連帶責任。這一則新聞作了該報的致命傷。</p>
<p>從去年十二月起，劇運到現在還在走紅運，六七個劇團爭奇鬥艷地在上演，但多半是把過去銀幕上出現過了的故事，重新搬上舞台。而舊年中，過去的「滿映」現在的東北電影公司，演出了「太平天國」，據說很能叫座。</p>
<p>冒充合胞　日人混水摸魚</p>
<p>長春台胞，往往被人誤認爲日本人，而日本人在秩序還未恢復的現在，有時做點混水摸魚趁火打刧的勾當，被人發覺時，多自稱是台灣人，台灣同鄉會爲了使魚目不能混珠，特發給台胞「台灣省民證」，用以辨別，免人假冒。</p>
<p>從二月一日起，日本男男女女胸前也都佩帶了一塊白布符號，符號上方印了鮮紅一個菱形，不仔細看時，儼若他們的太陽徽，紅色菱形下面，印有姓名住址兩欄，帶在胸前的，都塡上了字，全是中文，沒有絲毫洋氣，街頭走路的日本人有，店舖中的店員——日本人也有。</p>
<p>談虎色變　黑死病發現了</p>
<p>長春小偸相當多，街頭年輕人要鐵的也不少。據說：他們都是僞滿時代的「勞工」，到現在還無力歸家，流落在這裏，只有乞食度日。長春市府雖謀救濟，但杯水車薪，效果有限。以往常聽人說：東北沒有乞丐，除非是由關內初來這裏的墾民，在寒冬中無法活動，而自有糧戶救濟，決不至流落在街頭，但現在已不是從前。</p>
<p>街頭已經發現了「撲滅黑死病」的標語，雖然黑死病患者的區域，離開長春還有一段距離，但長春人都具畏懼之心，當人們談到了黑死病，都彷彿談到了出押的老虎，不禁勃然色變。（二日，寄）</p>
<h3>美國記者客觀報導　蘇軍在大連</h3>
<p>— 李却德·柯興</p>
<p>大連蘇軍到處皆是。蘇聯刻正視大連爲其私產，從各方面觀察，蘇軍殊有久居之意。大連北部武裝齊備之蘇軍，正在作大規模之演習。大連居民深信蘇聯或可於獲得某項經濟利益後撤離東北其他各地，獨於大連一市，無論給與任何代價，恐亦不肯識出。大連離蘇聯海軍基地旅順三十哩，蘇聯已在此間置有雄厚兵力，顯欲强力加以控制。蘇聯秘密警察監視外人行動，「如德國之一蓋世太保」。</p>
<p>無數機器　經大連運海參崴</p>
<p>蘇聯自東北各廠拆去無數機器，即經大連運往海參崴。據某居民稱：鞍山鋼鐵廠配備，其中百分之八十，曾於去年十二月十二日由蘇聯分裝運輸船卅艘，開往海參崴。記者隨星條報記者貝勒洛斯及聯合社攝影記者威爾遜，於昨日乘蘇方火車抵達大連。沿途見蘇軍方正舉行軍事演習，並使用戰車，臼砲，高射機關槍，及由美國借來之戰車等。吾人所乘火車行近大連時，瞥見蘇軍士兵，全付武裝匐匍兩旁田野間，如臨大敵。衝要地區均排置大砲，其型殊足驚人。戰鬥轟炸機，集中於大迎市外三哩之機塲，該機塲現正利用日人從事擴充，使其成爲亞洲最大飛機塲。蘇方對去年八月間所訂中蘇條約另有解釋，謂在戰爭期間僅蘇聯對大連有租借之權，在和平未恢復前，不能認爲戰爭業已結束。惟據中國方面解釋，大連係屬自由港，各國船隻均可出入。條約中絕無蘇聯得以單獨佔領之意。依據條約：大連係由中蘇兩國共同駐防。</p>
<p>大連市長　由蘇方擅自任命</p>
<p>大連蘇軍如此之多，則華方報告謂蘇軍近有四萬人自海參崴開到，不爲無因。每一蘇軍均携帶手槍或小型機關槍。此種機槍係紅軍中標準武器，携者甚多。現任大連市長雖爲中國人，但係由蘇方任命。蘇軍當局不許記者與其會見，中國政府所任命之大連市長沈怡，則在長春靜候接事已數星期。大連係於一九〇四年日俄戰事後讓歸日本，市內建築仍保有俄式作風，戰爭期問，未受損失。市上流通貨幣，計有「滿洲國」僞鈔，東北流通券與蘇方軍用票，上蓋圖記：不得拒絕使用，否則「須受處罰」。</p>
<p>日俘之謎　何必送西伯利亞</p>
<p>大連居民九十萬人，其中日人佔四分之一。蘇軍對待若軍日人，反較對待華人更客氣。此在東北，各地皆然，固不止大連一處如此。惟日本俘虜，究將如何處置仍爲不可解之謎。若輩曾一度爲蘇軍拆卸兵工廠機器，但據可靠方面消息：此項俘虜均已送往西伯利亞，並無一人遣送返國。鞍山鋼鐵工廠某工程師稱：蘇軍曾於去年九月領來日木俘虜三四千人，拆除該廠大型機器。另有該廠以前日籍僱員約三四千人一同協助，於十一日間拆去熔爐九座，其餘如旋力精削機，化學設備，帮浦，實騐儀器，馬達，及車輛等，亦悉被移去。遺留機器則由中國共產黨運走。蘇軍甚至曾用戰車將各項機器運至大連。</p>
<p>此間蘇軍或意在此久居，利用現有日本配備，從事生產。僅一機車製造廠遭拆除，將運往蘇聯改善其國內鐵路交通。紅軍軍官家眷，有自莫斯科及其他蘇聯城鎭遠道而來者。大連白俄近有數人失蹤，其中一人係蘇軍翻譯。內幕如何，無人知悉。據白俄稱：蘇軍待遇白俄，並不見佳。若輩均不願爲蘇軍工作，因一旦不需要時，將不知發生如何結果。蘇軍當局對其在大連任何活動拒不討論，並告記者稱：此係蘇聯之事，他人不必問鼎。記者等所乘火車於二時正，出大連車站。（二月廿八日，大連）</p>

<h3>同濟大學的遷校問題</h3>
<p>同濟脫離了她的出生地「吳淞」已整整八年，在「八一三」敵人砲火威脅下從溫暖的懷抱中拋出來，自此開始了流浪的生涯，更由上海到了全華，這一羣同濟兒女向着自己已無止境的前途奔跑着，砲聲漸漸逼近，出乎意料的消息不斷的刺着受創的心，「七七」抗戰已成了長期戰，重返故園的夢已被恐怖的砲聲驚走了，漫天的烽烟陣陣的血腥和火藥的氣味，追着一羣不幸的兒女再到贛州，在此只住了三月，不得不再到後方的「昆明」，在這千辛萬苦中以丁校長的力量成立了理學院，這是多麼慶幸的事啊！但是勝利的彼岸仍然是那樣渺茫，同濟乃在戰爭窒息的重壓下由昆明遷入了大後方的「四川」，而在江南李莊鎖的幾例破廟中作了棲身之所，李莊是一個背山面江的一個小鎭，同濟對於提高當地文化，安設電燈，協助役政以及和民主風氣的養成等等，都曾盡過些力。再如畢業同學在社會上服務的熟心，和上次從軍的踴躍，這都是事實擺在我們的面前。</p>
<p>物價不斷的飛漲，但是同濟的師生仍在愁苦的生活中掙扎，爲國家造就堅固的柱石，他們埋着頭苦幹不發一聲怨言，因爲他們懷着美滿的憧憬，期待着勝利的來到。値得慶幸的期待終於成了事實，勝利的鞭砲響了，法學院亦跟着成立，多年愁苦的夢驚醒了，生活的憂鬱而今變成了勝利的微笑，每個靑年人的面孔上浮出了歡樂興奮的顏色，一切的一切都新生了一樣，他們在嬉笑聲中爲勝利祝福，更爲新生的中華民國祝福。</p>
<p>戰爭是勝利了，但是「復員」亦是更急切的被希望着，我們是久違故鄉的流浪者正盼望着返鄉。我們急於嗅一嗅故園泥土的芳香。可是在復員聲中又帶來的一些令人辛酸的消息，上海校址無着，這是因爲吳淞的校址被敵人砲火所燬了，前三月去滬的醫工理三院長江鴻，顧葆當，蔣益生傳來的消息是接收　　中學正請當局核准中，　　醫院正與　　協商中，工廠無着，就是臨時校址的問題也就够複雜了，雖然三院長盡了最大的努力，可是仍然荊棘重重。同濟是以理工聞名的，工學院需要的是工廠機器，醫學院需要的是實習醫院，現在遷校的時期也究不知何時；可是交大一部份已遷滬，中大亦訂五月底以前遷返南京，我們呢？在此等待嗎？</p>
<p>前月徐校長誦明爲遷校事宜去渝，不久又派往東北接收，難道是爲同濟接收校址，工廠，機器嗎？並聞校長已不復返，學校的遷建費亦正造册呈請，這許多未解次的問題都深深銘刻在二千多同濟兒女的心靈中。我們希望下列數點能被當局早日解次，特此向社會人士同有關當局呼籲：</p>
<p>（一）在滬應有足够的臨時校址，並計劃建築永久校址。</p>
<p>（二）同濟遷返日期決定何時實行，並請撥給船隻。</p>
<p>（三）請校長返校商討遷校問題。</p>
<p>（四）核給學校足够之遷建費。</p>
<p>（五）撥給工廠，醫院，機器，醫葉等。（張光輝）</p>
<h3>社論　美國堅定政策的重申</h3>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯於二十八日在美京海外新聞總會所致演說，闡明美國政府對目前國際局勢所持之政策，是一篇舉世所久候的演辭。在國際關係未能趨於協調的今日，此一演說的發布，不特足以表明美國政府所持的堅定政策，於廓淸國際局勢的陰霾上，實屬很有裨益。全辭於婉轉的情調之中，吐露出美國政府堅定的政策，舉其大要，約如下列：（一）美國準備於必要時，以武力制止侵略；（二）美蘇之問，惟有鑄成不可原諒之大錯，始足以引起嚴重衝突；（三）任何國家未得批准或同意，無權駐軍於其它獨立國家之領土內；（四）任何强國，在被解放之國家或曾附敵之國家內，不能擅將敵產取爲已有；（五）不容任何一國獨覇世界。此辭雖係泛論，却針對目前之國際形勢而發，此項形勢自奧大利，匈牙利，經近東伊朗以迄中國之東北均有存在。反軸心戰爭將納粹法西主義的「權力政治一擊潰，而却有另」集權主義代之以興以圖稱覇世界。</p>
<p>不待明言，貝爾納斯的演說是特別針對出現於我國東北的情勢而言。蘇軍的駐在東北，不特不曾給予國軍進據以便利，抑且在其防區以內培植傀儡勢力以阻撓國軍的入駐；同時却又說國軍未能接收，致蘇軍的占領不能不予延展。凡此所爲，似均有背於中蘇友好條約的精神。無論局勢如何，我軍的未能進入瀋陽城，却依然是事實。東北接收工作的未能展開，依舊是事實。連美國駐華特使馬歇爾元帥想到東北去視察一番的時機都認爲未熟，不能前往；可知東北局勢密雲不雨依舊未能明朗。此際而有美國國務卿演說的發表，雖不能說對於廓淸東北的局勢有何直接帮助，但藉此而闡明美國堅定的立塲，於大局的開展，終是有裨益的。</p>
<p>繼貝爾納斯演說之後，我們又看見有美國務院發言人於一日所發表的聲明：「報載來自東北之消息，謂蘇聯正在東北搬運所謂「戰爭勝利品」一節，已促使美國向蘇政府聲明美國對此事之關心。美國約在三星期之前，已開始經由莫斯科美大使館與蘇政府討論，最近則與其它有關係國家之政府開始討論，此種討論，並非謂已經獲知蘇聯搬運所謂戰爭勝利品之事，蓋美國對於此事，並未接得直接情報，亦未正式獲悉此事之實際情形。國務院對於此事，發表聲明如下：「吾人與蘇聯政府或任何其它政府，並無關於東北「戰利品」之秘密協定或其它協定，美國政府不承認「戰利品之解釋爲包括工業或其組織要素，如東北之日本工業與設備等在內。若干時前，吾人曾通知蘇政府，處置日本在外資產，如東北之工業等，係共同利益之問題，凡對於擊敗日本曾負較大負担之盟國，均有關係。在此時期，以此等工業資產作爲「戰利品」，而由東北運走，或以中蘇兩國對管制此等資產之協定，對日本在東北之國外資產作任何最後之處置，均爲不合之舉。美國政府對於如何處置日本國外資產作爲賠款之問題，最近已與各有關政府開始討論。』</p>
<p>此一聲明之發布對「戰利品」一詞爲嚴正之解釋，於東北局勢的推移上見很有裨益的。有上述兩種聲明，於以見美國政策的益趨堅定。但對於目前國際陰霾的淸除，特別是存在中國東北的陰霾的淸除，若僅憑片面的演說或談話，雖足以表明態度，但於實際局勢恐仍無多大影響。東北局勢之所以演進到現階級的局勢，主要是由於國際背景。雅爾達的秘密協定注定了東北的命運；而在決定其命運中，我們始終沒有參預。爲廓淸東北的陰霾，這似乎已不是由中蘇兩國可能解次的事，必須由參加雅爾達協議的各國共同起而努力，然後事態纔可以有解次的途徑。我們歡迎美國有堅定政策的重中，更希望美國政府於發表聲明之外，能有實際的行動來支持它堅定的國策。</p>
<h3>羊城漫步</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員梁風寄</p>
<p>這裏點　着這春光的，應該算是在春節同時開關的幾所規模宏大的娛樂塲。一所在長堤，一在中央公園，其餘　所在惠福路，一在西瓜園。這些娛樂塲都是當局主持辦理的，一些是冬令敎濟會主辦，也有是緊急救濟會主辦。</p>
<p>寓救濟於娛榮　成效却待分解</p>
<p>據聞這些娛樂塲，都是爲了救濟而開設。儘管地點不同，而救濟意義則一。所謂寓救濟於娛樂，等於「跳舞不忘救國」一樣，所以許多都說廣東人頭腦聰明。衹要你肯花三二百塊錢，便可看幾塲戯，而且在塲內還加設什麼氣槍射擊，穿寶鴨頸圈，鬥狗，這一串新鮮而又刺激的玩意。雖然能够實際救濟到幾個難民，這還要聽「下回分解」，但最低限度，已使數十萬市民都「樂在其中」了。</p>
<p>幾天「黑市假」　苦了小公務員</p>
<p>在機關裏，春節放了幾天「黑市假」以後，小公務員們都拖着疲乏的身子上辦公廳去「等因奉此」了，可是還有不少官兒們却意興未蘭。也許是「春色惱人」的緣故吧。最流行的就是銀燈臘板的玩意。雖然這裏早有禁止跳舞的明令，公開的舞塲委實已經沒有，但說非公開而實在是公開的舞會却天天在舉行。這裏比校著名的有勝利大厦，留東同學會，留美同學會，留法同學會與夏威夷餐廳等，另外還有不少娛樂部式的私家舞會。</p>
<p>兩少將學孤步　女中委開舞會</p>
<p>每當華燈初上，這幾個地方門前便　滿了各式各樣的汽車，可見與會的都是些高貴人物，會塲裏不是筆挺的洋裝便是炫耀的戎服，和那五光十色的女士們的春裝相襯，婆娑舞影，眞是蔚爲大觀。在廣州市最流行之舞爲探戈舞，次爲華爾茲及普魯茲，林巴等，在香港流行之「林巴獲」及「巴利士杜魯」等，在廣州舞會甚少見到，但「滿塲飛」則間有舉行。據記者調查所得，最近有少將二人感覺跳舞爲交際塲中所必需，特聘專家担任敎習，近已見其出現於舞池，頗能攬腰作狐步矣。又某女中委曾開舞會，招待貴賓，倒也是事實。由此，亦足見這裏舞風之熾了！</p>
<p>商塲攻勢未動　劇運處處勃發</p>
<p>在商塲，表現得非常寂靜。各商店都靜靜的，一點也看不出有準備發「動春季攻勢」之跡象。</p>
<p>在文化圈裏，春日間較大的活動，要算是劇人們慶祝勝利後的第一個戲劇節。二月十五日那　，數百劇人在民衆會堂舉行慶祝第八屆戲劇節大會，會後全體劇人舉行遠足旅行，參觀日俘集中營及嶺南大學。還有一個盛大的節目，是由全市各劇團輪流演出十三個戯。</p>

<p>勝利後，皖鄂贛收復區內，食鹽需要孔亟，渦去由長江水道絡續運往，爲數不少。但區域廣泛，仍供不應求。最近又因長江水位枯落，大船不便行駛，建輸量亦减退，故食鹽需求尤爲殷切，茲悉閩浙淮之產區，存量豐富，只缺船隻運輸。交通部爲解決是項問題，日前命令本市航政局，轉令各航業機關，儘先調撥船舶，從速　運本市存鹽，至皖贛鄂收復區，並派船赴浙岡各產區搬運。各航商接獲航政局訓令後，正統盤籌劃中。聞平安輪船局大華輪，昨日自福州返滬，有大量食鹽運來。又三北公司明　輪，今日可到埠，亦由福州運來鹽五千餘包</p>

<h3>報業勞資糾紛　當局分送仲裁書</h3>
<p>西采咖啡業工潮調解成立</p>
<p>上海市報業職業工會，前向資方要求增加工資，向本年二月份起，工友月薪基數，以民國二十六年每一工人平均工資五十五元計算。其薪津依市政府公佈之工人生活費指數爲升降標準。資方對於此項要求未能同意，乃經市政府·市商會·總工會·等所派定之仲裁委員，數度商討，於三月二日決定仲裁書，業已分別送達雙方。其主文云：資方應自本年二月份起，增加工資，其增加之方法如下：（甲）資方應根據勞方各人之工作技能，服務經騐，及各報館渦去慣例，營業狀况，與勞方在最低法幣三十元，最高五十元之間，個別商定工資基數，再乘當月之工人生活費總指數計算。（乙）以後每月工資，槪依各該月之工人生活費總指數升降。</p>
<p>本市西菜咖啡業職工自怠工以米，爲時已久，經社會局數度調解，得告圓滿解決。勞方定今日一律復工，昨日在金谷飯店雙方簽訂調解筆錄，到資方代表王振，勞方代表諸世法等五人，社會局朱圭林，市黨部方如升。</p>
<p>又上海市鉛印某職業工會，於上月二十三日，推派代表，向資方同業公會協商。勞方要求調整最底四項生活待遇：（一）每月底薪四十五元，照當月生活指數核算，並希自二月份起實行。（二）每日供給二飯一粥。（三）實行一二八制工作，夜工以五小時爲一工。（四）星期日以及國家休假日，一律休假。雙方經過幾次協商，資方未能同意，以致怠工。</p>
<h3>勸令停止工作皮件工人遭毆</h3>
<p>頭破血流者計六人</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市皮件業工會，因要求改善待遇，曾於上月間請求社會局調解，迄未解次。故最近由工會出動工人數十人，分別至各皮箱皮件作塲，勸令停工。昨日午後三時，該工會工人多名，擁至東大名路永成里八十四號大康皮件作塲內，老闆劉明記及其子世德，見彼輩前來，即潛出糾集靑口帮碼頭小工三十餘名，持鐵尺等武器趕來，圍住工人亂毆，致頭破血流者有六人，後經崗警將受傷者併送滬東醫院醫治。該工會事後據報，即召集工人二百餘名，馳往出事地點。該管提籃橋分局，亦即會同保衛團大批武裝彈壓，警局並將劉明記父子兩人帶去究辦。</p>

<h3>金潮起伏中　一週市況撮要</h3>
<p>上週金融性各物，在當局禁令之下，加以外匯決定開放，市場人心　　，烚赤外幣首常其　，行情逐步下游，其他商品，亦跟　報小，衆意　市開放，中外貿易將見圓滑，囤積者咸具戒心，各項物品市勢，雖仍有波折，但起伏狹隘，已不若過去之暴，計金價由週初一七二萬盤旋下降，至週六一四二萬元有交易，美鈔則由二五〇〇元回至二千關口。</p>
<p>華股週一私做，衹有二大熱門及三小熱，供求稀淡，趨勢向下，週四以後，游資轉向，北帮套買，市勢頓見鋒鋩，美亞出二千元外，紗廠升至二七五〇元，週六始見回風。</p>
<p>外股與華股走勢相同，週初恍惚，　四以後，轉見俏俐，週六回疲。</p>
<p>統債週初趨勢欠佳，丙種曾低至一四五○元，週三以後，游資又見活動，價多軋升，直至週六，有當局派員查究之說，價始回小。</p>
<p>現紗在上週問因黃金下游，粵漢等主要客帮採辦較前减色，執有現貨者逢高轉賣，致市况步降，布市初尚緊俏，入後隨黃金與紗價疲落，花市以紡建公司對於四十二支及三十二支等高級細絨採辦爲多，尤以米特林成交獨鉅，此外民營各紗廠原有存貨，足敷應用，故需要甚稀，市勢以細絨花蛟爲平庸，粗絨籽花獨鬆，計米得漲四千元，大中集三餘鎭巴西花下沙花火機花等無大變動，周浦籽花獨跌三千三百元。</p>
<p>人造絲在上週內，現貨至週四止，計短去五十萬元之鉅，降低原因有三，其一，同發倉庫棧單可以出貨，其二，禁止棧單交易，减少投機買賣，其三，金價暴落，隨大勢所趨，直至週五起，又復回高十餘萬元，總計一週內跌去三十五萬元，半光人絲搜求甚股，週二起高於有光十萬元，總計短去二十萬元，廠經各檔均小二十萬元至二十五萬元，一週內交易零星，另擔絲間有遷就打五天期票成交，綢貨美亞被面與大誠格璧縐，週二至週四間，跌風甚厲，週五起不乏逢低吸收者，故復做高，一週內總計美亞被而每百條只小一萬五千元，大誠格璧縐小四百六十元。</p>
<p>食米週初略見回小，旋即以連日陰雨，來源稀少，行情步步回升，僅麵粉因善救署開售平粉，比皎站定。</p>
<h3>許世英等組織　安徽茶葉公司　資金二億元</h3>

<h3>商業調查　上海絲織廠最近槪況</h3>
<p>絲織廠商，自上海淪陷後，受敵人種種非法摧殘，如限制電力，甚至斷絕供給，被迫停工，在抗戰勝利前，開工者不足十之一二，大都賴自裝木柴引擎，掙扎圖存，迨抗戰勝利後，電力普遍供給，現在已有三百餘家復工，共有織機五千餘台，其間滄桑變遷，已無足述，茲略記目前大略情形。</p>
<p>最近開工情形</p>
<p>上海絲織廠範圍較大者，如美亞。大誠·新大。當强·榮豐。百達。九昌……等，擁有織機七八十台至一二百台不等，其他小型廠織機十餘台至三四十台者居多，目下電力已普遍供應，各廠均接電開工，惟尚有一部份因一時工人不易僱用，及原料高昂，貨價不及成本關係，致間有未曾全部開工者，去年十二月間，一度發生罷工風潮，僵持達二十餘天之久，後得當局調解而復工，農歷年關休假，大都於一月廿八九日停工，二月七八日開工。</p>
<p>綢廠內部組織</p>
<p>綢廠之組織，視其範圍之大小而定，惟大略情形，不出下述數部份，工塲部份，需熟悉機械構造者爲工頭，指導織機工人，準備部份，完成打綫併頭工作，漿染部份，專門漿絲染絲，紋工部份，計劃花樣，繪畫意匠紙，踏成花本，鐵工木工，備以修理機械，其他如扻經·接頭·撈頭·搖紆·絡絲等，各司其職，更需延聘經騐豐富，能設計造貨者爲廠長，總司廠內一切事務，一廠廠務之發達，與僱用技術人員之能否適當，及管理方面之能否嚴密，關係至鉅，普通小型綢廠，因受環境之節制，組織方面，類皆簡單，廠長工頭，一人兼顧，其他工作，均須臨時僱用，一切仰給於人，欲求其在業務上競爭，勢必遜人一籌。</p>
<p>出品及生產狀況</p>
<p>出品種類，以原料而別，總計可分四種，蠶絲品，人造絲品，蠶人絲交織品，紗人絲交織品，又可簡稱爲花式貨，男式貨，與大路貨，花式貨如目前盛行之黑白縐及織錦緞，完全人造絲織品，黑白縐原料，用一〇〇或七五無光，縮面袋組織，每一織機，每日可生產十二三公尺，織錦緞用一〇〇有光，每日出品約十公尺左右，天香絹采芝綾維馨縐等，係蠶人絲交織品，每機能織十二公尺，格子璧縐有男式女式二種，全用蠶絲織造者爲佳，間有蠶人絲交織，不耐穿着，每機生產量約十公尺之譜，被面有全蠶絲與人造絲及紗人絲交織之別，織機幅面，較普通綢機闊三分之一，每日生產在五六公尺之間，大路貨如華錦縐羽紗光明緞等，每機能出品約廿五公尺左有，綈葛即以紗和人造絲交織而成，生產量與華錦縐等相仿，不過上述生產量之多寡，尚須視織機之新　及龍頭之快龍頭或閘刀龍頭與織工之有無經騐而別，不可同日而語也。</p>
<p>銷路及原料問題</p>
<p>在昔綢貨銷路，眞絲貨以北方去胃最多，其他如廣帮漢口帮等，銷路亦不弱，南洋帮另有專銷洋裝之綢緞，花色與各帮不同，本街銷塲以花式貨居多，目前交通尚未恢復原狀，各帮均無大量採辦，銷路因是未能暢旺，現下裝往四川一帶者，賴航空郵包寄遞，爲數不大，將來舟車暢達後，綢貨銷路，前途頗有希望，至於原料一項，封閉倉庫物資，未能儘量開放，存底日薄，現貨缺乏，如人造絲目前只有消耗而無來源，當局有鑒於斯，已山中紡公司將封存二萬餘箱人絲中，貶價拋售一千五百箱於絲織廠商，因此市價一度影響低回，廠經爲出口貨之一，售價隨金値而上升，存貨日少，執貨老往往居奇　斷，造成恐慌局面，以遂其高價之私慾，原料情形若此，誠非絲織廠商之福音。（慕夷）</p>

<p>〔本報重慶三日電〕敎育部召開之中等以上學校遷校會議，連日會議商遷校有關問題，經次議由敎部在渝籌設主持遷校機構。遷校事宜，其原則有六：（一）距渝遠者先遷，（二）在同一學校與機關，以學校先遷，（三）儘量利用公路，（四）原址政權未收復者緩遷，（五）自行決定，（六）各校赴收復區籌備人員，得儘先空運。據統計專科以上學校員生，約計九萬餘，預計可於五至十月間運送完畢，經費預算爲八百億，而行政院僅核准六百億，將由敎育部分配各校運用。</p>
<h3>市小敎職聯誼會　要求改善待遇</h3>
<p>發表宣言維護主權</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕市小敎職員聯誼會，昨日上午十時，在比德小學舉行理事會代表會聯席會議，出席者共百餘人，由徐子齡茅文培樊析玄主席，除檢討過去工作外，並議決要案如下：（一）本會與其他各社團之聯繫，事前須經理事會之通過。（二）改善待遇問題，決定推代表五人，分向敎育局及市政府面遞呈文，提出請求，希望能依底薪基數，按月照物價指數升降。（三）關於東北蘇軍搬運物資，遲不撤退，當塲一致通過，決定發表宣言，擁護政府尊重中蘇條約，維護國家主權之立塲，向蘇聯積極交涉，不達目的不止。</p>

<h3>美將利用無綫電　在日施再敎育</h3>
<p>日人敎育水準並不高明</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山一日電〕　克準將廿六日向美　廣播公司特派員宣稱：就日本善後問題而言，無綫電所佔之地位，甚爲重要。譚克現任東京敎育及情報部長，一九四三年直至就任目前職位以前，曾任麥帥總部之情報與敎育處處長。據譚語記者稱：凡曾受戰爭敎育所毒化之國家，將以無錢電等方式，啓發其對國際諒解，言論自由等事實之認識。譚克準將及其部下曾利用報紙雜誌電影等工具在日本施行再敎育，但結果不佳，因日人所自誇之「高超文化水準」並不確實。日人自稱人口中百分之九九·六，均爲智識份子，但實際上東京市每十人中僅有一人能誦讀通告牌上日戰犯之姓名。在日本施行再敎育而不用無綫電實屬不可能。</p>

<h3>勞工福利的兩種措施</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>據最近報載，本市社會局勞工處發起組織，「上海市各工廠員工消毀合作社」，以供給社員低廉之日常必需物品，使工人實際工資增加，發送物價生活為目標，已召開第三次籌儲會議，出席者有上海電力公司·電話公司·永安·福新紗廠·紡織業·機器業·捲烟業工會等共五十單位代表，積擷籌儲進行。資金來源，計有三種，就是（一）由廠撥相當數額為提倡股，（二）如有福利基金得提出一部份撥充，（三）由職工認股。</p>
<p>同時社會局勞工處，還有一個對於勞工福利方面的措施，就是自本月份起特約海寗路海光電影院，乍浦路民光，勝利電影院，每逢星期日上午輪迴放映勞工電影。影片內容，注重生產建設，時事新聞及與勞工生活有關富有敎育意義者，門票免費贈送，本市各勞工國體可備函於每星期四五向社會局勞工處索取。</p>
<p>這兩個措施，的確說得上是適應目前環境所需要的，前者可以解決勞工生活上的物質的問題，後者可以解決勞工生活上的精神的問題。本來目前一般廠商，也未曾不想到勞工的福利問題，觀乎國外廠商的勞資合作，一切設施，真是令人羡慕，但因為廠商本身尚有許多問題，沒有解決，甚至弄到了窮於應付的地步，因此一時實在不能顧到勞工的福利問題，現在由社會局來主持，實在可以事半功倍，所以這兩個問題舉動，可以說是社會局當前的一種德政。</p>
<p>以前者，的確可以根本解決勞工的生活問題，我們希望　理得盡如人意，那末不但勞工首獲其利，即社會秩序的安寗，購買力的培養，也可以得到相當效果。至於後者，那末我們希望所放映的影片，要經過嚴密的選擇，同時如果電影方面辦理具有成效，更　展到其他精神食糧的供應方面，諸如設立圖書館，舉行學術演講，出版有益書報導。</p>
<h3>創辦文具建設工廠的　合記敎育用品社</h3>
<p>— 忻</p>
<p>目前中國欲亟　敎育之建設，對於敎育之器材，則不能不先事生產之建設，文化日趨發達，敎育程度不斷增高，敎育用品，亦逐漸科學化，藝術華，日新月異，中國向為商業不振，科學　後之國家，在獎勵生產，建國首先建設敎育的呼聲中，筆者樂於介紹具有實幹精神，孜孜於生產工作，切實輔助敎育的實業家——堂先生，及繼其志者，王福清先生。</p>
<p>王　　值得我們親敬的實業家，腳踏實地從事於實業的建設，沒有絲毫商　的氣習，辦事當有毅力和決心，福清先生早年曾留學德國，歸國後，佐筱堂先生經理合記敎育用品社之業務，以最新之思想，導該社為時代之前趨，以科學之方法，施行管理，以新穎而合法的步驟，實行交易，該社因有優良而合理的陳規，予以保守，腐舊而有害的惡習，絕予改革，因此，同人振奮，業務旺興，合記在王氏之撫治下，便定立了不拔的基礎。</p>
<p>合記創立後之最初十年中，筱堂先生鑑於國幣之外溢，遂從事製造廠之生產事業，專造粉筆原紙墨水等各種重要敎育用品，他們以貨傎價實的原則，了無數的顧客，外埠各文具商如四川幫，西安幫，漢口幫，長沙幫等，都同情於合記的踏實交易，都樂於購銷合記的產品，因此國貨得以推銷，挽回了相當的利機，至今華中廠（EK）牌的打印墨水及其他產品，在市場上所佔的地位，還是相當著名，這就是合記始終以貨傎價實的原則，實行忠誠的交易的緣故。</p>
<p>一二八之戰，王氏的勞績，幸免於砲火，八一三烽火迷漫，王氏手創的生產機構，不能免於敵寇砲火的摧燬，不得已遂設法將物資陸續內移，由漢口而長沙而衡陽而重慶而昆明，隨國軍到處，遂步　徙，更經歷香港廣州貴陽桂林等地，於各地設立辦事處，冀得連絡，不幸到處均遭敵寇蹂躪，所運貨物，或因轟炸或直接遭過戰事因而受到相當嚴重損失，據王氏談至今尚有一批內移貨品存在鎮海，在去年六月間，正擬內運，忽被所謂政治保衛團寗波支團部的敵僞份子，認為資敵，竟被扣留，和平後，王氏曾向浙江當局請予發還，迄未見有結果，總計內移貨品遭受之損害，為數實屬不貲，王氏以百折不撓之精神，與敵在物資方面，作消極之抵抗，以迄於和平。</p>
<p>如今，王氏的精神，益加激動，期以整個之力量，供獻於建國，以前被燬之事業，都正在設法予以復興，將以大量之生產品供獻於敎育之建設，且更努力於業務之改進，無論在人事方面，營業方面，生產方面，經濟方面，以及職工之待遇方面，都着手予以嚴格之整理，比如說吧，最近上海各處，都鬧着罷工怠工的風潮，八大公司及商務印書館等，勞方與資方為着待遇的不公平而起糾紛，但合記的資方對勞方却有深切的了解，薪資原定額相當的高，足以維持生活所需，除供給職員以　宿外，還要安頓職員家屬的佳所，備有職員的宿舍，不使職員感受到生活為難之苦，所以每個職員都能夠　　　　，因此能使事業　成更高度的　　，總之：王氏要　　合記成為最合理想，最進貨的工商國體，使它永遠為社會的前　，始終　努力建國的一員健將。</p>
<p>王氏不但為合記事業的前途着想，並且抱更大的熱忱，為全國的文具工商業着想，他希望文具商都能聯合起來，組織一個研究所，專做ReseaRch的工作，使國　品的質地與構造，都加以澈底的改進，能與舶來品競爭，挽回整個敎育用品業的工商利機，筆者對於王氏之熱忱，不　有感，假若我國商界各業，有組織有毅力的去實幹，那麼中國商務之振興，實　之建設，及整個國家商業利機之挽回，無疑的指日可待了。</p>
<p>合記創立於宣統三年，可以說是敎育用品業的較先創立者，宣統年間的中國狀況，還是相當的陳舊，一般腐化思想的中國人，還只知以文房四寶為惟一的文具，專門的文具業，就很少見到在上海一埠，筱堂先生當時毅然創立合記敎育用品社，確是具有獨特的實業眼光，我們再推究他成功的原因，這其中種種，當然有值得後來者　法的價值，下列數點，也許是他成功的重要因素吧。</p>
<p>（一）貨傎價實，實事求是，不作虛偽的宣傳；</p>
<p>（二）堅定目標，從事於國產之推銷，博得顧客之同情；</p>
<p>（三）管理有方，勞資合作；</p>
<p>以上各點，看起來似很平淡，若要將它付諸事實，倒反覺不是十分輕而易舉的事，有志於實業的人們，當以是為供鏡呢。</p>
<p>最後，筆者認為還值得一提的，便是福清先生的為人，他的態度溫和，舉止灑落，平素沉靜寡言，既繼筱堂先生之志以拓展，事業又願以其業務之成就，供獻於建國，洵屬難能可貴，福清先生且好讀書，家中藏書甚富，在德國留學，曾精研藝術史，由是知福清先生豈但為實業家，亦為學問家，筆者略有藝術之癖好，有　還想乞敎呢。</p>
<h3>生產建設之路</h3>
<p>— 徐雨孫</p>
<p>雨孫先生主持中國歷史悠久的景綸衫襪紡織廠，處理有方，出口精良，本　所述，的確針對現實，頗多足實採取的建議，敬請　者注意—編者</p>
<p>生產建設，這是國家在戰後希望復興所必要實施的一種首要的工作。第二次世界大戰結束至今已有半年了。我們舉止凝看，世界無論甚麽地方都缺少它們所需要的東西。過去四年間，歐美工業發達的國家，因　戰事的需要而將它們大部分的工廠改為製造軍用品的機關。像美國漢彌登愛爾近等大鐘錶廠，都將它們原有的工作委託瑞士錶廠代做，愛羅內衣廠也把民用內衣部分改為製造軍服的工廠了。瑞在戰事結束，數百萬軍隊中有大部分人要恢復他們原有的職業和生活，再加上一般平民在戰爭四年後對於衣着及一般日用品的巨量需要，而工廠改裝機械的工作一時尚未完成，自然就造成普遍物資缺乏的現象。不過在工業設備完善的國家，要恢復生產工作並不十分艱難，因為技術既有辦法—其實，加上數年製造的經驗，在多方面較前更有進步—原料和運輸也沒有多大的問題，要走上生產建設的大路，在短期間便能實現的。</p>
<p>在我國，戰後談生產建設便不像這樣的簡單了。所能稱為工業中心的幾個都市，在八年來不是遭遇砲火的摧燬，便是被偽搜括到非常窮困的地步。僥幸可以搬到內地或留在上海開工的廠家，因受原料和交通的限制，其生產和營業額無不較前減少。在這些廠內和停工工廠的技術技術人員，一部分因着生活而改行，一部分因年齡而減少了他們的工作効能，更有一部分已經去世了。而且我國工廠以中小型居多數，經過八年的折磨，苦門，和消耗，如今要希望它們全仗自己的去恢復生產，加增生產，這個要求未免有些過分，而且事實上也不可能。政府當局有鑒於此，遂有工礎貸欵的辦法。這是工廠的福音，這是促成生產建設的推動力。但是目前有幾件障礙，是我們急　能夠迅速銷除的，技術，機械，原料，以及政府的扶助，仍難順利地踏上生產建設的途徑。、</p>
<p>交通與運輸，抗戰時期我國水陸交通遭遇空前的破壞。最近共軍又鈄修復的鐵道拆毀一部，以致今日旅行和運輸已成為極其困難的事情。中國的交通至少倒退了五十年！這種狀況，極影響到原料和製成原料缺乏，物價動　，和供求失調等等的現象。所以恢復和改進我國的交通和運輸機構，幾乎可算是生產建設的第一需要。</p>
<p>幣制和外匯：「在二月二十六日國防最高委會通過開放外匯市場之前，上海的金融經濟可以說是處於混亂狀態之中。投機分子唯恐天下不亂，於是興風作浪，造出許多似有似無的謠言，於是物價隨着這些謠言忽起忽落，連帶者就影響到棉紗布疋五金化學等工業原料價格的動　不定。從事於生產事業的工廠，在進貨和成本的價格上，自然便感到很大的困難。此次政府決定之外匯新條例，雖不能完全解決它們的困難，但是我們相信它至少能制止一部分的投機行為，和穩定貨品和原料的價格。</p>
<p>開放外匯市場案對於洋貨的進口，分為自由，許可，和禁止三類，我們深信這是有助於我國生產建設的一個政策。我們希望政府當局要早日確定這三類洋貨的細目，並嚴格地執行所訂定的辦法。對於民營工廠實際需要外洋機器原料而其出品又係有關民生者，我們希望政府在請求外匯方面予以便利和優待。</p>
<p>官民間的諒解與合作：我們不能否認，政府與人民間缺少諒解與合作，乃是生產建設的一大障礙。一般工商界對於官方施政的看法是：不合理，不切事實，拖延，苛求，而政府當局却時時在提防工商界的敷衍，逃避，和陽奉陰違。我們認為雙方應開誠坦白。工商界應該毫無顧忌地向官方陳述本身的利害，困苦，和意見。政府在旅行任何一種工商法令或稅則之前，應當根據現有事實澈底研究，有時應邀業中人參加意見，以免政令一經發表，立即引起多方的非難，結果往往要取暫緩施行或再待修訂的辦法。政府要拿事實來表現它是　到工商界的困難和利害，更得拿事實來表明它願意予工商界以合理及切合實際的扶助和鼓勵。官場的繁文縟節，在工商界看來是浪費和延宕，在手續方面越是簡單越是敏捷越好。這樣，我們相信可以增進官民的合作與諒解。</p>
<h3>美國產業界的展望</h3>
<p>— 淸和</p>
<p>美國的人民，向來是　　很大的購買力的，但自從第二次世界大戰開始以後，政府施行極補　時限制，因此他們不能按照　各人的　　購買，這樣節省下來的錢，根據統計所載，計有一千五百億元之多，這上級指示　錢在結束之後，正將用以購買前些所買不到的各種消耗品。</p>
<p>據美國商務部調查，美國工業界，對於國際感，已經達到了空前濃厚的程度，各工廠也決定把全部生產量的百分之六至十五，作為出口之用，無論國內的市場怎樣。</p>
<p>在各種生產品中，下列幾種，是比較地最值得注意的，不妨　分如下：</p>
<p>汽車業：根據估計，到達一九四六年年終，全國的產量，將達到六百萬量的數字，其中包括貨運軍一百萬至一百五十萬　。</p>
<p>無線電工業：據一九四一年記錄所載，美國國內的無線電收音機銷售量為一千三百萬架，在戰後估計，對於收音機的需求，將較一九四一年增加四倍。</p>
<p>電化器材：電化器材的需要，也非常廣大，因此在一年中將展開大規模的生產，大部份電器工業家，準備以百分之十五的生產品輸出。電氣水箱到一九四五年為止，超過十五萬具，預料在一九四六年，將更為增加。</p>
<p>肥田粉：美國全國肥田粉的消耗量相當地大，到了一九四二年已增加至全年，一千三百萬　，在一九四六年中，無疑地將更為增加。</p>
<p>防疫藥品：自從防疫藥品DDT發明之後，求過於供，據說國內的消耗量，可以在一年內滿足，接着就可以把个餘剩的　量輸出。</p>
<p>紡織品：美國的紡織品生產量，在一九四二年，抵達最高　，後來因戰事而低落，今後將大規模的從事生產，以應需要。</p>
<h3>生產動態</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>新的膠質</p>
<p>在一年之前，奇異電氣公司的宣傳部長，向着一羣新聞記者，把一包香烟拋到河裏去，等一會去拿出來，水漬流去，香烟絲毫沒有損壞，這原因是用了一種新的膠質（Plastic），這是三十年來的一　　　發明，　允　功的　　和化學公司，考寗玻璃製造　，和奇異電氣公司。</p>
<p>這種膠質的原料是　油　水和沙，　　　成一種霧　的氣　，經他噴灑以後，就不會着水，就是水分不會滲入。這種噴霧的方法，可以施用於香烟或其他無張。</p>
<p>用了這個方法，可以做成各種新　的東西，諸如雜貨商所用以盛裝食物的紙袋，在賽球時大量出售的臨時雨帽，即一種膠質更可以施用於的輕實衣服，甚至皮鞋上，可以得到防雨的作用。</p>
<p>吉平敎授和英國諾丁漢大學的學生研究這一種膠質，開始於四十年前，已經定下了製造的方案，在十年之前，考寗玻璃製造廠的蘇立文博士決立研究膠質和玻璃之間的分別，以吉平敎授的研究結果作為根據後來又和德和化學公司聯合起來，結果發明了一種新的膠質，名叫Sililone。將來在油漆方面，收果　利以後，耐熱力很高。在奇異電氣公司裏，曾經加以試驗，即使在華氏表四百八十二度的高熱，還是絲毫沒有損害。</p>
<h3>吸收新思想</h3>
<p>— 王驚</p>
<p>在芝加哥達德爾大　裏有一句很好的標語，就是「一個最能幹的人，是最能夠利用外界的意見的」。因為每一個工商從業人員，決不能單靠他自己一點點的創造力量，而必須參考外界的意見，加以援用的。</p>
<p>那些新奇的意思，可以從書本，觀察，談話，旅行等機會中獲得，實際上隨處可以獲得這種資料，祇要肯去找尋，隨處都可以發現新奇的事實，或參考資料，可以援用起來。</p>
<p>從前有一段故事，說根據一般人　　者的經驗：以為在山頂上是　採不到黃金的，但實際上有一天有一個人果然在山頂上獲得了大量的黃金。由於這一個例子，可以知道祇要　時留意或努力找尋，到處可以得到很好的資料。</p>
<p>有時從外界獲得的資料，可以立刻加以應用，不需要有什麼更　，但有時候却需要加以相當的更改，從前有一個汽車製造廠主人和他的太太出去參觀一家織造廠，發現了一個很好的意思，立刻加以應用，首創加數　的柏德遜，在他出售煤塊的時候，產生了　造加數　的動機。</p>
<p>從前有一個很聰明的人，用信件去推銷機電，其實他所用的信件，是參考一封的售肥皂的信件的，不過略加更　而已。</p>
<p>所以，為隨時記錄各種新意思起見，每一個人可以備一本小冊子，當發現了新的意思之後，就可以記下來，隨時加以應用。要使一種事業始終前進，需要不時的將新思想，新事物。溫莎公爵從前曾經說過一句話。就是：」我的必須採取，修正，改良」We　Must　Acopt　Adapt　Improve　的確是一句至理名言，可以作為工商從業員的座右銘的。</p>
<h3>三種主管人員</h3>
<p>— 傅良駿</p>
<p>據英國效能雜誌　，主管人員，可以分為下列三種，第一種能夠站在時代的前面，並且能夠領導同業，第二種是在可能範圍之內，求取進步；第三種即使有人在推動，也不會向前進步。因此第一種可以說是最進步，第二種可稱尚進步，第三種竟然是落伍了。</p>
<p>現代的工業界，希望有第一種主管人員，他能夠站在職員的前面，領導他們，如果有新發明或是新的設備發現現以後他會立刻加以應用，他的思想是隨時都在進步的。</p>
<p>同時他不但在公司範圍之內，求取進步，更不時留意外界的動態，所以他的事業，可以與日俱進，能夠有迅速的進步。</p>
<p>至於第二種人，祇能配合環境，第三種人那末就不免為環境所支配，不能　最發展了。</p>
<h3>中國蠶絲公司</h3>
<p>— 禮</p>
<p>在前期本刊，曾介紹中國紡織建設公司，現在再把中國蠶絲公司的概略情形介紹如下：</p>
<p>中國蠶絲公司的醬總額，除接收在江·浙·皖三省敵偽蠶絲資產，由經濟農林部結價外，再加五億元，由經濟·農林部一次撥足。總公司設於上海，並得在國內外各地設立分公司，辦事處及工廠場所，營業範圍方面，計分下列各項：</p>
<p>一·蠶業事業之飼育栽培事項，二·絲　之　製事項，三·天然絲之加工織紡事項，四·成品之運銷事項，五·蠶絲帶來之學術研究事項，六·民營蠶絲事業之輔導獎勵事項。</p>
<p>該公司董事及監察人選，由經濟農林兩部會同聯任譚伯羽·譚熙鴻·薛壽宜·周貽春·發慎予·馬保之·冷　·?輔成·高事恒·葛敬中·湯錫祥等十一個人董事，陳郁·張茲聞。常宗會·鄭羣　·邵申培等五人為監察，並以周貽春兼董事長，總經理一職，由董事會聘請葛敬中担任</p>
<p>據最近消息，該公司為恢復戰時摧毀之桑園，已向日本訂購桑苗二百萬株，並於前日首批運到上海八十萬株，正與農林部商訂積　辦法。</p>
<h3>缺席延長戰爭</h3>
<p>美國在戰時各種生產，都是盡力以赴的，在寇的斯，雷德戰時工場裏曾經有一句標語說「缺席延長戰爭」Absence　Makes　The　War　Grow　Longer　的確是一句很動人的標語，辭意深長。</p>
<h3>事業的長成與試鍊</h3>
<p>— 羅立羣</p>
<p>無論那一種事業的長成，在過程中，必然遇到許多困難，這種困難，就是事業成敗的試鍊，我們在遇到困難的時候，要越過這段艱苦的歷程，對於事業，必須具備深切的信仰，堅忍不變，沉　處理。飛綸製錢廠在創辦之始，因為事屬劃創，不免遇到許多困難，但因為抱定宗旨，終於把許多困難解決了，例如在八一三後，上海許多工廠，有的解散，有的內移，飛綸廠現無辦內移0銷路又陷停頓，結果在南洋方面，獲得新的發展，但太平洋戰事發生以後，銷路中斷，接着收買紗布，原料又成問題，但即使在困苦的情形之下，也努力奮斗門，終於度過了難關。所以由於過去的經驗，感覺任何困難，都可以解決的，我想凡是從事於工業的，都有同感。</p>

<h3>The Second Plenary Session Continued its General Assembly Yesterday: Reviewing the Military Demobilization Problem, Ordering Separate Discussions on Finance, Economics, and Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Second Plenary Session held its second general assembly at 9:20 AM on the 3rd. 226 Central Committee members attended. Committee member Zou chaired the meeting. After the customary formalities, the secretariat read the minutes of the first general assembly and reported on the continued receipt of letters and telegrams requesting leave from committee members and congratulatory telegrams from various party departments. Then, Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng (Deputy Minister Lin Wei representing him) gave a report on military demobilization, which concluded at 10:40 AM for a break. The meeting continued at 11:00 AM, with the chairman announcing the commencement of the review of the military demobilization report. Committee members raised issues for review regarding the coordinated development of the navy and air force, the cultivation of the national defense army's spirit, the disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers, the establishment of a conscription system, the preservation of received materials, the establishment of military industries, the inadequate treatment of military personnel and the deteriorating handling of military grain procurement, and the slow progress of compensation work. Seven speakers, including Ju Zheng, Liu Jianqun, Miao Peicheng, Fang Qingnuo, Zhang Banghan, Gu Zhengding, and Chen Zhaoying, addressed these points. Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng responded to the various questions, stating that constant efforts were being made to improve the issues raised by the committee members, and that efforts would be focused on resolving the minimum living standards for military personnel and the proper disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers. Subsequently, the chairman announced: (1) The list of participants in the Military Demobilization Problem Report Review Committee, convened by Xu Yongchang, Zhu Shaoliang, and Wang Zongshan. (2) The list of participants in the Local Administrative Committee, convened by Song Ziwen, Xiang Chuanyi, and Zhang Lisheng. (3) The list of participants in the Border Affairs Report Committee, convened by Zhang Lisheng, Bai Yunti, and Liang Hancao. Finally, the secretariat reported that the general assemblies on the 4th would be held in the morning and afternoon, with the morning session focusing on the report and review of financial and economic issues, and the afternoon session focusing on the report and review of diplomatic issues. The meeting adjourned at 12:23 PM, with the afternoon for rest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] The Second Plenary Session currently being held in Chongqing is the first meeting since the Japanese surrender. President Chiang is personally presiding. It is widely expected that the plenary session will make important decisions regarding the future status of China's ruling party in the constitutional period.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, Wu Tiecheng, reported to the Second Plenary Session yesterday that over 5,000 Kuomintang underground workers were killed by the Japanese during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan. Regarding domestic political events, Wu stated that the resolutions obtained at the Political Consultative Conference proved the Kuomintang's sincerity in hoping for democracy. He also stated that the people of the Northeast have "not yet been protected by the government, and their rights to survival and democracy have become a problem." China's recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence indicates the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing Sun Yat-sen's nationalism, but efforts will be made to strengthen the national consciousness of various border ethnic groups to consolidate national unity. He further emphasized that all actions that violate diplomatic, financial, and military principles should be thoroughly corrected.</p>

<h3>Deputy Minister of Military Affairs Lin Wei Reports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] At the Second Plenary Session's second general assembly, Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng (Deputy Minister Lin Wei representing) gave a report on military demobilization, dividing the explanation into two major sections: general work from the past year and this year's demobilization plan. Regarding the general work from the past year, it was divided into six items: (1) Streamlining the army, reducing 36 armies, 109 divisions, and 21 brigades, reducing by about one-third. Currently, there are 89 infantry armies, 2 cavalry armies, and 225 divisions.</p>
<p>(2) Handling guerrilla forces, mostly reorganized into regular forces, and some reorganized into security regiments. (3) Reorganizing puppet troops. (4) Collecting and utilizing enemy military materials. (5) Reorganizing and replenishing equipment, uniforms, and food for receiving units. (6) Awards and compensation. As for this year's central demobilization work, it includes (1) Demobilization of troops, reduced to the smallest possible extent based on national defense needs. The key points include: A. The total demobilization time is set at 18 months, divided into two phases: the first phase is 12 months, and the second phase is 6 months. B. In the first phase, the National Army will demobilize from 89 infantry armies and 242 divisions to 30 armies, 90 divisions, 51 engineering construction general detachments, and a number of officer corps. The 2 cavalry armies and 13 divisions will demobilize to 10 brigades. The demobilization of the National Army during this phase will be divided into stages. The first stage is scheduled to begin on March 16th, with army group headquarters demobilizing into army headquarters, armies demobilizing into commands, and each division reducing one regiment and forming two-regiment brigades, to be completed by the end of May. In the second stage, all armies and divisions will be uniformly reorganized according to regular formations, totaling 90 divisions. The cavalry armies will demobilize into divisions in the first stage, and the cavalry divisions will reduce one regiment and form brigades. In the second stage, they will be demobilized to 10 brigades according to the regulations. C. In the second phase, the National Army will demobilize from 90 divisions to 50 divisions, 40 engineering construction general detachments, and a number of officer corps. The cavalry will be reorganized into 6 brigades. D. The demobilization work of the Youth Army is scheduled to be completed by the end of May, and all remaining officers and soldiers will be converted to training reserve officers. The numbers of its three armies and eight divisions will be temporarily retained.

<h3>An American Female Journalist Talks About Her Impressions of Visiting Yan'an; Arriving in Shanghai Today en Route to the United States to Lecture</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] American female journalist Atlee, who recently returned from an inspection tour of Yan'an, will go to Shanghai on the morning of the 4th and then travel to the United States to engage in lecturing and writing. When the reporter interviewed her, she said that her impression of Yan'an was: she met with General Zhu De in Yan'an. The CCP is still in the early stages of implementing communism. Before the working class and peasants fully believe in communism, they must still go through a stage like the Soviet Union's so-called New Economic Policy. The CCP is making every effort to win over the people. If the CCP gains power, I believe they may take the same path as the Soviet Union, because they seem to follow Moscow on certain issues, and they also lack political sincerity. For example, when talking about the Northeast issue, their concern for Soviet interests seems to exceed their concern for Chinese interests, and they often cleverly defend the Soviet Union. Their methods and arguments are the same as those of communists elsewhere. Although their work is very diligent, the most pessimistic thing is that they often ignore the magnitude of the international losses inflicted on China.</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Withdrawal Plan from the Nine Eastern Provinces: Moscow Yet to Respond. Peng Bisheng Denies Claims of National Army Withdrawal from Shenyang.</h3>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 3rd] According to reliable sources here today, China's policy toward the nine eastern provinces is to refuse any economic concessions beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The general public believes that China's policy has hardened due to two factors: (1) national sentiment as expressed by student demonstrations, and (2) the clear attitude of the United States toward international events as clarified in Secretary of State Byrnes' speech. Regarding reports that the Soviet Union has protested the anti-Soviet demonstrations by Chinese students, Chinese officials have neither confirmed nor denied it. However, according to inquiries made by reporters with reliable sources, the Soviet side has indeed lodged this protest, but the exact wording is being kept strictly secret by the authorities. China sent a note to Moscow on January 29, inquiring about the Soviet Union's plan to withdraw its troops from the nine eastern provinces.

According to reports, after United Press reporter Davies and eight other American and British reporters arrived in Shenyang, they telegraphed on the 21st of last month, stating that a reporter asked Stankevich what happened to the heavy industrial machinery built by the Japanese, what were the war spoils? Stankevich replied: "In terms of the matter, we cannot allow it to remain here in accordance with the Three-Power Agreement, and a portion has already been transported out." A reporter asked again whether machinery from Shenyang had been moved to the Soviet Union? Stankevich replied: "Perhaps there is."</p>

<h3>Arab Nations Oppose Jewish Statehood; Partition of Palestine is a Source of Chaos; League Nations Issued a Joint Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters Cairo, 3rd] The Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee held a meeting here at the Mena House Hotel yesterday (where Chairman Chiang met with the late U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill in 1943), attended by representatives of all Arab countries. Arab League Secretary-General Assam spoke in English, stating that the Arab countries have formed a unified front on the Palestine issue and will not hesitate to fight for it if necessary. The Arab countries are in complete agreement on the Palestine issue. We have fought for Palestine for 200 years in the past, and we are prepared to continue to fight to prevent the intrusion of Jews. Palestine must continue to be an Arab country. The purpose of the establishment of the Arab League is not to compete with other powers, but to connect kindred countries and cooperate in pursuit of peace. We are willing to sacrifice for peace, order, and justice, but we can never sacrifice our survival or everything in a country that has been passed down to us by our ancestors for more than 1,300 years. Although the United States and Britain are oppressing us, we will never allow our compatriots in Palestine to be reduced to a minority. Mr. Assam also submitted a formal memorandum to the Anglo-American Investigation Committee, stating: The Arab countries recognize Palestine as the first line of defense against common dangers, and the Arab League is determined to use all means to prevent the realization of Jewish statehood with the greatest effort. After Palestine falls into the hands of the Jews, it will inevitably become the center of international turmoil and religious struggles. At the end of yesterday's meeting, Abdullah, the son of the King of Jordan, read out a declaration signed by all Arab countries, stating that Palestine cannot be separated from the world, Jewish immigration must be stopped, and the work of establishing a Jewish state must also be stopped.</p>

<h3>Eastern Bloc</h3>
<p>Turkey Participating is Feared to Provoke Soviet Displeasure</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 2nd] According to official sources here, Turkey does not intend to join any "Eastern Bloc" or closely cooperate with the Arab League in the political sphere at this time unless absolutely necessary. The most important reason is the fear of causing a very unfriendly reaction from the Soviet Union, which would only make the already very tense situation more serious without gaining anything.</p>
<p>[United Press Ankara, 3rd] Representatives of Turkey and Iraq held a meeting here yesterday. Observers predict that the results of the meeting could consolidate the relations between the two countries and affect the entire Middle East situation.</p>

<h3>Hitler Commits Suicide, New Wife Takes Poison; Britain is Searching for Witnessing Guards</h3>
<p>[United Press Herford, 3rd] British detectives are now searching throughout Germany for a Stormtrooper guard who witnessed Hitler and his new wife Eva Braun commit suicide. This new clue was obtained by interrogating German Deputy Adjutant Colonel Von Biller. Von Biller fled Hitler's living room on April 29 of last year. It is said that on May 6, he met a soldier who told him that Hitler and Eva Braun had committed suicide on the afternoon of April 30. Hitler killed himself with a pistol, and Eva Braun died by taking poison. Afterwards, their bodies were cremated by their guards. This soldier opened the cellar on the day after Hitler's death. British detectives have already inquired about his surname, age, and appearance. Von Biller believes that Hitler had indeed committed suicide for the following reasons: (1) Hitler himself wanted to commit suicide and first expressed this intention on April 22. (2) Hitler could not escape from Berlin at this time or hide without being recognized. (3) Hitler lacked the physical strength and courage to survive. Von Biller confirmed that Hitler and Eva Braun were married in the cellar between midnight and 4:30 AM on April 29.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister of East India Reinstated; Expansion and Reorganization of Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Will Go to Batavia to Reopen Negotiations with the Dutch</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 3rd Broadcast: The political crisis in Indonesia caused by Prime Minister Sharif's resignation has now passed, as Prime Minister Sharif has agreed to be reinstated. Mr. Sharif obtained a vote of confidence from the Central Committee of the Indonesian National Movement today, and he has begun to reorganize and expand his cabinet. He is scheduled to lead the new cabinet back to Batavia tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 3rd] It is hoped here that after Sharif reorganizes the government, negotiations with the Dutch authorities will continue. However, if radicals gain power after the reorganization of the government, the prospects for an early resumption of direct negotiations will be thwarted, as the radicals demand unconditional recognition of independence as a prerequisite for their meeting with Van Mook. British Envoy Lord Killearn believes that the Dutch government's proposal can be a fair basis for mutually satisfactory negotiations, and the Indonesian nationalist movement should seek a solution as soon as possible for its own benefit.</p>

<h3>Vietnamese Independence Faction Brewing Major Revolution</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 5th Broadcast: The London Sunday Observer's special correspondent telegraphed from Hanoi today, predicting that a major revolution will occur in Vietnam. There are only minor contacts near Saigon at present, but when the French army lands in the north this month to attempt to rebuild the colonial government, the main battle will begin. The Provisional Government of Vietnam, currently presided over by Ho Chi Minh, possesses 100,000 regular troops and 50,000 guerrillas, firmly insists on gaining independence, and has been supported by the majority of the Vietnamese people.</p>

<h3>Can a US-Soviet War Be Avoided? Harriman Answers in the Negative</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, March 3rd Broadcast: Radio commentator Fanno asked former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, today whether a US-Soviet war is unavoidable. Harriman replied: "I absolutely do not believe the US and the Soviet Union will go to war, but it still depends on the Americans themselves. If Americans continue to maintain their original strength in spirit and material terms, there will be no war between the US and the Soviet Union." Harriman continued, "Although the US and the Soviet Union differ greatly in ideology, if both countries adopt a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, then this ideological difference will not be an obstacle. The Soviet Union seeks security, but using the control of neighboring countries as a way to obtain security is inappropriate. The whole world hopes to obtain collective security through the United Nations organization."</p>
<h3>Massive Snowfall in Western Europe, Unseen in Seventy-Four Years</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, February 2nd] Paris and its surrounding areas were covered with heavy snow yesterday, a rare occurrence in the past seventy-four years. The snow accumulation is very thick everywhere, and traffic is greatly hindered. Cars have added chains to their tires to facilitate driving, a situation that has never happened before. Another report says that the English Channel and southern England have had continuous heavy snow for days, with a snow accumulation of three feet, and all traffic in the Channel has been suspended.</p>

<h3>More Than a Hundred Bales of American Cotton Will Be Shipped to China Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, February 2nd] The Department of Agriculture disclosed today: The United States hopes to ship 1.5 million bales of cotton to Japan next year, and ship the same amount of cotton to China.</p>
<h3>Byrnes's Firm Policy, Supported by American Officials and the Public, Connally Says Action Should Follow Negotiation, Atomic Secrets Should Not Be Disclosed Until Security is Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, February 2nd] Since Byrnes announced a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, American officials have echoed the sentiment. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally also expressed his support at a press conference today. Connally said: "I believe that to get along with the Soviet Union, the way is not to tell them 'We are your enemies.' We should take a position that we know is upright and stick to it. When a problem arises, we should deal with it and follow negotiation with action. The government's foreign policy is firm and consistent, and I am in agreement with Byrnes's views." Connally, who had just returned from attending the United Nations meeting in London, reportedly said that Stettinius did not try to evade or shirk responsibility in the Security Council regarding the "subtle and complex four issues," namely Greece, Iran, East India, and Syria and Lebanon, and made sure that the meeting was not dominated by the Soviet Union. As a result, except for the last issue, the Soviet Union's proposals were rejected. Regarding the establishment of an atomic energy commission in the United Nations organization, Connally said: "I and others who share the same opinion believe that world security must be guaranteed by some kind of international organization before we agree to disclose atomic bomb secrets to other countries. Otherwise, no matter who, when, or under what circumstances, we will never give up the atomic bomb. When will security be guaranteed? I don't know." Connally also said that the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will be extended for another year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, February 2nd] Mrs. McCormick, a diplomatic analyst for the New York Times, said: Byrnes's speech at the Overseas Press Club is quite in line with the general public's demand to strengthen its attitude towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now makes people think that it wants to cause chaos in the world, not peace, at a time when its exhausted allies are extremely eager for a moment of peace and tranquility. As early as last winter, it was discovered that the British people, who greatly admired the Soviet Union during the war, had already felt disgusted with it, and so did the Americans. The people who previously demanded that soldiers return home now demand that the United States have a firm position. They have become aware of new difficulties and dangers and have asked the US government to shout to maintain its strength.</p>
<h3>Our Consul-General in Singapore Negotiates Remittance Matters for Overseas Chinese, Asks the British Side to Allow It Without Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, February 2nd Dispatch] Our Consul-General in Singapore, Ren Bosheng, wrote to Malayan Chief Civil Affairs Officer, Hoon, this morning, formally raising the issue of small amount remittances with the British authorities. The letter strongly stated that Chinese overseas compatriots, with their labor and enthusiasm, have loyally dedicated themselves to the development of Malaya. They want me to declare to Your Excellency and the British government that they are still willing to contribute their labor and enthusiasm in any work of reconstruction in Malaya, but they also ask Your Excellency and the British government to give urgent sympathetic consideration and approval to their request to remit money to their home country without restrictions. This matter has a very serious relationship with the overseas Chinese here, who have suffered the most severe and cruel punishments of the Japanese military and have bravely and loyally supported the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Tries Its Best to Exchange Counterfeit Money. In this city, counterfeit money is already refused to be used, and the general public feels very painful. Now the Soviet Agricultural Branch is trying its best to exchange it, which can be implemented in a short period of time. According to the bank's statistics, since the beginning of the exchange, in the month of Niuyue, the counterfeit money received has reached 15 billion, 006.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Police Station Arrests Pig Robbery Criminal</p>
<p>The detective team of the police station arrested the famous thief Lu Zhang in the Huayuan Hotel. After investigation, it was found to be related to the He Jinji robbery case in Zhanghuanggang, Nantong. Recently, the thief gathered a crowd, holding long and short guns, and robbed fifty-one pigs near Langshan, escorted them to Fushan and transferred them to the city. They were sold to the Beiwai Gong Sheng Pig Bank, priced at more than 3.2 million yuan. The bank did not have enough cash at the time, so they agreed to pay the next day. The thief opened a room in the Huayuan Hotel that night, and because the opportunity was not secretive, the case was immediately solved, and a strict investigation was carried out.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Telegraph to Request Additional Consultation Representatives</p>
<p>The chairman of the Southern Jiangsu District, Southeastern District, and Chongqing Branch of the National Industrial Association of China said that in this political consultation meeting, the existing National Assembly representatives failed to allow the people who have contributed to the Anti-Japanese War in the past eight years to participate in this round of representative meetings, and the number of additional representatives was more than 700. Yesterday, he sent a special telegram to the head office, requesting that it be forwarded to the competent authorities of various parties, asking them to give priority to industrial production personnel who have contributed to the Anti-Japanese War when selecting additional representatives, so as to conform to their promises and to realize full democracy. Determine the number of places to be produced by the industrial sector, and then limit the number of places for party affiliation and factions, and entrust industrial groups across the country to elect them through universal suffrage, instead of just calling for an increase in the number of places and increasing the number of places through distribution.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>County Expenses in Deficit, Province Approves Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>The county's local expenses in this county rely entirely on taxes. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the field tax for the 34th year was exempted, and the county's political expenses were not settled. Although the province ordered the local government to raise funds by allocating loans to wealthy gentry based on the number of fields, with the 34th-year county-level public grain as collateral, the people could not bear the burden, causing disputes. Last month, the county government submitted a request to the province to borrow 20 million yuan from the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank at an interest rate, but it was not approved. Public officials at all levels are serving the public with empty stomachs. County magistrate Fang submitted a request to the province for relief. The province believes that this kind of difficulty is indeed a fact and will temporarily allocate more than 9.8 million yuan under the national tax item for this county in January to maintain it. All local fundraising measures will be abolished and no more loans will be borrowed from the people.</p>

<h3>A News Item Killed a Daily Newspaper: No Firecrackers in Changchun</h3>
<p>— Written by Fang Ren</p>
<p>…Northeast Aviation News of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Let’s start with the Lunar New Year after the first victory. Really, it wasn’t the way it was imagined more than five months ago when it was first restored. There were no firecrackers on New Year’s Eve, it passed quietly. Everyone felt that "the year was not flavorful enough." However, compared with the past fourteen years, this year is still somewhat different. For example, in previous years, each person could only get the little bit of things "rationed" to them to eat - four ounces of pork, one catty of flour, half a catty of wine, two apples, and one orange. The flour and pork could only be made into dumplings and eaten all at once. This was how the most interesting Lunar New Year was spent. But this year, it can be freely bought and sold. As long as you have money, you can have as much as you want.</p>
<p>Comforting the Brothers, the Cold Wind Blows Away the Joy of Drinking</p>
<p>The Changchun City Comfort Committee, in the Lunar New Year,</p>
<p>For the sake of expressing condolences to the troops coming to Changchun, it specially donated 9,600 catties of pork and 3,200 catties of white wine, allowing the brothers who came to the icy and snowy areas outside the customs to have a big feast. Of course, when they were eating and drinking happily, they may have a feeling of "drinking a toast to the Yellow Dragon", but this is just a thought, which can easily be blown away by the cold wind.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year mood in Changchun, the New Year's goods stalls are of course the most prominent symbol, and the only means of transportation for the common people in Changchun - the horse-drawn carriage - is the messenger spreading the New Year's atmosphere outside the New Year's goods stalls. Because the sphere of influence of the New Year's goods stalls is limited, and the horse-drawn carriages, each with a red square "Fu" character pasted on the body, and the couplet "The carriage travels thousands of miles, people and horses are safe" attached on both sides, are dazzling and gallop through the city, bringing the heat of Sima Road to every corner of the city.</p>
<p>Dahua Daily Suffered a Fatal Wound</p>
<p>There are currently three newspapers in Changchun, all of which are four-page broadsheets. One is called Changchun Daily, one is called Guangming Daily, and one is called Dahua Daily. But the general phenomenon is that news is scarce, and there is currently no way to improve it, so people who come to Changchun say in unison: When you get here, everyone has to become disabled, either deaf or blind.</p>
<p>Among the three newspapers, Dahua Daily has been suspended since January 31st, because the newspaper published a news item on January 29th, saying that the Soviet army issued an emergency order that firecrackers are not allowed to be set off from now on. If someone sets them off and is discovered by the Soviet army, they will be shot immediately. If they are discovered by the Chinese police, they will be detained, and the Baojia chief will also be held jointly responsible. This news item was the newspaper's fatal wound.</p>
<p>Since last December, the drama has been running in good luck, with six or seven troupes competing to perform, but most of them are bringing stories that have appeared on the screen in the past back to the stage. And in the Lunar New Year, the former "Manchuria Film Association", now the Northeast Film Company, performed "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", which is said to be very popular.</p>
<p>Impersonating Compatriots, Japanese People Take Advantage of the Chaos</p>
<p>Changchun Taiwanese compatriots are often mistaken for Japanese people, and Japanese people sometimes do things that take advantage of the chaos when order has not yet been restored. When they are discovered, they often claim to be Taiwanese. In order to prevent imitation, the Taiwan Compatriot Association specially issued "Taiwan Provincial Resident Certificates" to Taiwanese compatriots to distinguish them and avoid impersonation.</p>
<p>From February 1st, Japanese men and women also wore a piece of white cloth symbol on their chests. The symbol was printed with a bright red diamond shape at the top. If you don’t look carefully, it looks like their sun emblem. Below the red diamond shape, there are two columns for name and address. Those who wear them on their chests have filled in the words, all in Chinese, without any foreign style. There are Japanese people walking on the streets, and there are shop assistants in the shops - there are also Japanese people.</p>
<p>Talk About Tigers with Fear, Black Death Has Been Discovered</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of petty thieves in Changchun, and there are also many young people who want iron bars on the streets. It is said that they were all "laborers" during the puppet Manchurian period and are still unable to return home and are stranded here, only begging for food. Although the Changchun Municipal Government is seeking relief, it is a drop in the bucket and has limited effect. In the past, people often said that there were no beggars in the Northeast, unless they were reclaimers who had just come here from inside the customs, who could not move in the cold winter, and there would be grain households to help them, and they would never be stranded on the streets, but now it is no longer the past.</p>
<p>The slogan "Eradicate the Black Death" has been discovered on the streets. Although the area where the black death patients are located is still a distance from Changchun, the people of Changchun are all afraid. When people talk about the black death, they seem to be talking about an escaped tiger, and they can't help but change their colors. (Sent on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>American Reporter's Objective Report: Soviet Troops in Dalian</h3>
<p>— Written by Richard Cushing</p>
<p>Soviet troops are everywhere in Dalian. The Soviet Union is currently viewing Dalian as its private property. From all aspects, the Soviet army seems to be intending to stay for a long time. Soviet troops fully armed in northern Dalian are conducting large-scale exercises. Residents of Dalian firmly believe that the Soviet Union may withdraw from other parts of the Northeast after obtaining certain economic benefits, but in Dalian alone, no matter what price is given, it may not be willing to recognize it. Dalian is 30 miles away from the Soviet naval base in Lushun, and the Soviet Union has placed a strong force here, obviously wanting to strongly control it. Soviet secret police monitor the actions of foreigners, "like the Gestapo in Germany."</p>
<p>Countless Machines Shipped to Vladivostok via Dalian</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has dismantled countless machines from various factories in the Northeast and transported them to Vladivostok via Dalian. According to a resident, 80% of the equipment of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was loaded on 30 transport ships by the Soviet Union on December 12th last year and sailed to Vladivostok. Yesterday, the reporter arrived in Dalian by Soviet train with Star-Spangled Banner reporter Bayloros and United Press photographer Wilson. Along the way, we saw the Soviet army holding military exercises, using tanks, mortars, anti-aircraft machine guns, and tanks borrowed from the United States. As the train we were riding on approached Dalian, we caught a glimpse of Soviet soldiers fully armed, lying prone on both sides of the field, as if facing a great enemy. Artillery pieces were placed in key areas, and their types were quite alarming. Fighter-bombers are concentrated at the airport three miles outside Dalling City. The airport is currently being expanded by the Japanese to make it the largest airport in Asia. The Soviet side has a different interpretation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in August last year, saying that only the Soviet Union has the right to lease Dalian during the war, and that the war cannot be considered over until peace is restored. However, according to the Chinese interpretation, Dalian is a free port, and ships from all countries can enter and exit. There is no intention in the treaty that the Soviet Union can occupy it alone. According to the treaty: Dalian is jointly defended by China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Dalian Was Appointed by the Soviet Side Without Authorization</p>
<p>There are so many Soviet troops in Dalian that the Chinese report that nearly 40,000 Soviet troops have come from Vladivostok is not without reason. Every Soviet soldier carries a pistol or a small machine gun. This type of machine gun is the standard weapon in the Red Army, and many people carry it. Although the current mayor of Dalian is Chinese, he was appointed by the Soviet side. The Soviet military authorities did not allow reporters to meet with him. Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian appointed by the Chinese government, has been waiting in Changchun for several weeks to take over. Dalian was ceded to Japan after the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The buildings in the city still retain a Russian style. During the war, it was not damaged. The currencies circulating on the market include "Manchukuo" counterfeit banknotes, Northeast circulation coupons, and Soviet military tickets, with the stamp: "Refusal to use will be punished."</p>
<p>The Mystery of Japanese Prisoners: Why Send Them to Siberia?</p>
<p>There are 900,000 residents in Dalian, of which Japanese people account for a quarter. The Soviet army treats Japanese people who are prisoners of war more politely than Chinese people. This is the case throughout the Northeast, not just in Dalian. However, how the Japanese prisoners will be dealt with is still an incomprehensible mystery. They once dismantled the machinery of the arsenal for the Soviet army, but according to reliable sources: all of these prisoners have been sent to Siberia, and none have been sent back to their country. An engineer from the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant said that the Soviet army brought 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese prisoners in September last year to dismantle the large machinery of the plant. Another 3,000 to 4,000 former Japanese employees of the plant also assisted in dismantling nine furnaces in eleven days. Other equipment such as rotary cutting machines, chemical equipment, pumps, experimental instruments, motors, and vehicles were also removed. The remaining machinery was transported away by the Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet army even used tanks to transport the various machines to Dalian.</p>
<p>The Soviet army here may intend to live here for a long time and use the existing Japanese equipment for production. Only one locomotive factory was dismantled and will be transported to the Soviet Union to improve its domestic railway transportation. Family members of Red Army officers have come from as far away as Moscow and other Soviet cities and towns. Several White Russians have recently disappeared in Dalian, including one who was a Soviet army translator. No one knows the inside story. According to White Russians, the Soviet army does not treat White Russians well. They are all unwilling to work for the Soviet army because they do not know what will happen once they are no longer needed. The Soviet military authorities refused to discuss any of their activities in Dalian and told reporters: This is a matter for the Soviet Union, and others need not ask. The train that the reporters were riding on left Dalian Station at 2:00 p.m. (Dalian, February 28th)</p>

<h3>The Relocation Problem of Tongji University</h3>
<p>Tongji has been separated from its birthplace, Wusong, for a full eight years. Under the threat of enemy artillery fire during the "August 13th Incident," it was thrown out of its warm embrace and began a life of wandering, moving from Shanghai to all of China. This group of Tongji students ran towards their seemingly endless future. The sound of cannons gradually approached, and unexpected news continuously pierced their wounded hearts. The "July 7th Incident" resistance war had become a long-term war, and the dream of returning to their old home had been startled away by the terrifying sound of cannons. The sky was filled with smoke and the air with the stench of blood and gunpowder, chasing this group of unfortunate children to Ganzhou. They only stayed there for three months before having to move again to Kunming in the rear. Amidst all this hardship, President Ding managed to establish the College of Science, which was truly a cause for celebration! However, the shore of victory remained so distant. Under the suffocating pressure of the war, Tongji moved from Kunming to Sichuan, deep in the rear, and settled in several dilapidated temples in Lizhuang, south of the Yangtze River. Lizhuang is a small town nestled against the mountains and facing the river. Tongji has done its best to improve the local culture, install electric lights, assist in military service, and foster a democratic atmosphere. Furthermore, the dedication of its graduates in serving society and the enthusiastic participation in the military in the past are all facts before our eyes.</p>
<p>Prices continue to soar, but Tongji's teachers and students are still struggling in their difficult lives, forging solid pillars for the country. They bury their heads in their work, without uttering a single complaint, because they harbor beautiful aspirations, looking forward to the arrival of victory. The worthy expectation has finally become a reality. The firecrackers of victory have sounded, and the College of Law has also been established. Years of sorrowful dreams have been awakened. The melancholy of life has now turned into a smile of victory. Joy and excitement have surfaced on the faces of every young person. Everything has become new. They bless the victory amidst laughter and even bless the newborn Republic of China.</p>
<p>The war has been won, but "repatriation" is also being hoped for even more eagerly. We are wanderers who have been away from our hometown for a long time and are looking forward to returning home. We are eager to smell the fragrance of our old homeland's soil. However, along with the call for repatriation comes some distressing news. There is no suitable location for the Shanghai campus. This is because the Wusong campus was destroyed by enemy artillery fire. The news from the three deans of the Colleges of Medicine, Engineering, and Science, Jiang Hong, Gu Baodang, and Jiang Yisheng, who went to Shanghai three months ago, is that they are taking over a middle school, pending approval from the authorities; the hospital is being negotiated with; and there is no factory. Even the issue of a temporary campus is complicated enough. Although the three deans have made their best efforts, they are still facing many difficulties. Tongji is known for its science and engineering. The College of Engineering needs factories and machines, and the College of Medicine needs a teaching hospital. Now, the time for relocation is still unknown. However, a part of Jiaotong University has already moved to Shanghai, and Zhongshan University is scheduled to return to Nanjing before the end of May. What about us? Are we going to wait here?</p>
<p>Last month, President Xu Songming went to Chongqing to discuss the relocation, and soon after, he was sent to the Northeast to take over. Could it be to take over campuses, factories, and machines for Tongji? It is also heard that the president will not return, and the relocation expenses are being prepared and submitted. These many unresolved issues are deeply engraved in the hearts of over two thousand Tongji students. We hope that the following points can be resolved by the authorities as soon as possible. We hereby appeal to the public and the relevant authorities:</p>
<p>(1) There should be sufficient temporary campus space in Shanghai, and plans should be made to build a permanent campus.</p>
<p>(2) When will the date of Tongji's return be decided, and please allocate ships.</p>
<p>(3) Please have the president return to the school to discuss the relocation issue.</p>
<p>(4) Approve sufficient relocation expenses for the school.</p>
<p>(5) Allocate factories, hospitals, machines, medical equipment, etc. (Zhang Guanghui)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Reaffirmation of America's Firm Policy</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' speech on the 28th at the Overseas Press Club in Washington, D.C., clarifying the U.S. government's policy on the current international situation, is a speech that the world has long awaited. In today's world, where international relations have failed to move towards coordination, the release of this speech not only demonstrates the firm policy of the U.S. government, but is also very beneficial in clearing the haze of the international situation. The entire speech reveals the firm policy of the U.S. government in a tactful tone. Its main points are as follows: (1) The United States is prepared to use force to stop aggression when necessary; (2) Only an unforgivable mistake between the United States and the Soviet Union would be enough to cause a serious conflict; (3) No country has the right to station troops in the territory of other independent countries without approval or consent; (4) No strong country can take enemy property in liberated or formerly enemy-aligned countries as its own; (5) No country is allowed to dominate the world. Although this statement is a general discussion, it is aimed at the current international situation, which exists in Austria, Hungary, the Near East, Iran, and even Northeast China. The anti-Axis war defeated the "power politics" of Nazi fascism, but another totalitarianism has taken its place, attempting to dominate the world.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Byrnes' speech is specifically aimed at the situation that has emerged in Northeast China. The Soviet army's stationing in the Northeast has not only failed to facilitate the National Army's advance, but also cultivated puppet forces within its defense zone to hinder the National Army's entry. At the same time, it has said that the National Army has failed to take over, so the Soviet army's occupation cannot but be extended. All of this seems to be contrary to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. No matter what the situation, the fact remains that our army has failed to enter Shenyang City. The failure to start the takeover work in the Northeast remains a fact. Even U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall believes that the time is not ripe to go to the Northeast for an inspection, and cannot go. It can be seen that the situation in the Northeast remains unclear. At this time, the publication of the U.S. Secretary of State's speech, although it cannot be said to directly help clear the situation in the Northeast, is ultimately beneficial to the development of the overall situation by clarifying the firm stance of the United States.</p>
<p>Following Byrnes' speech, we also saw a statement issued by a U.S. State Department spokesman on the first day: "News reports from the Northeast stating that the Soviet Union is transporting so-called 'war booty' in the Northeast have prompted the United States to express its concern to the Soviet government. The United States began discussing this matter with the Soviet government through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow about three weeks ago, and has recently begun discussing it with the governments of other relevant countries. This discussion does not mean that it has already learned of the Soviet Union's transportation of so-called war booty, as the United States has not received direct information on this matter, nor has it officially learned of the actual situation. The State Department issued the following statement on this matter: "We have no secret agreement or other agreement with the Soviet government or any other government regarding 'war booty' in the Northeast. The U.S. government does not recognize the interpretation of 'war booty' to include industrial or organizational elements, such as Japanese industries and equipment in the Northeast. Some time ago, we notified the Soviet government that the disposal of Japanese assets abroad, such as industries in the Northeast, is a matter of common interest, and is related to all Allied countries that have borne a greater burden in defeating Japan. At this time, it is inappropriate to treat these industrial assets as 'war booty' and transport them from the Northeast, or for China and the Soviet Union to make any final disposal of Japanese foreign assets in the Northeast through an agreement on the control of these assets. The U.S. government has recently begun discussing with the relevant governments how to dispose of Japanese assets abroad as reparations."</p>
<p>The issuance of this statement, with its strict interpretation of the term "war booty," is very beneficial to the development of the situation in the Northeast. With the above two statements, it can be seen that the U.S. policy is becoming increasingly firm. However, to clear the current international haze, especially the haze that exists in Northeast China, merely relying on one-sided speeches or talks, while sufficient to express an attitude, may still not have much impact on the actual situation. The reason why the situation in the Northeast has evolved to the current stage is mainly due to the international background. The secret Yalta Agreement determined the fate of the Northeast; and in determining its fate, we have never participated. To clear the haze in the Northeast, it seems that this is no longer a matter that can be resolved by China and the Soviet Union alone. All countries participating in the Yalta Agreement must jointly rise up and work hard, and then there may be a way to resolve the situation. We welcome the reaffirmation of the firm policy of the United States, and we hope that the U.S. government can take practical actions to support its firm national policy in addition to issuing statements.</p>
<h3>Strolling in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper in Guangzhou</p>
<p>What brightens up the spring here should be a few large-scale entertainment venues that opened at the same time as the Spring Festival. One is on Changdi, one is in Central Park, and the others are on Huifu Road and in Xiguayuan. These entertainment venues are all run by the authorities, some are sponsored by the Winter Relief Association, and some are sponsored by the Emergency Relief Association.</p>
<p>Saving Through Entertainment: Effectiveness Remains to Be Seen</p>
<p>It is said that these entertainment venues are all opened for relief purposes. Although the locations are different, the meaning of relief is the same. The so-called saving through entertainment is like "dancing without forgetting to save the country," so many say that Cantonese people are clever. As long as you are willing to spend three to four hundred dollars, you can watch several plays, and the venue also adds things like air gun shooting, throwing rings around treasure ducks, and dog fighting. While it remains to be seen in a "future installment" how many refugees can actually be saved, at the very least, it has made hundreds of thousands of citizens "happy in it."</p>
<p>A Few Days of "Black Market Holiday" Has Made Small Civil Servants Miserable</p>
<p>In the agencies, after a few days of "black market holiday" for the Spring Festival, the small civil servants dragged their tired bodies to the offices to "await instructions." However, many officials are still in high spirits, perhaps because "the spring scenery is annoying." The most popular thing is the silver lamp wax board game [dancing]. Although there is an explicit ban on dancing here, there are really no open dance halls, but dance parties that are not openly held but are actually open are held every day. The more famous ones here are the Victory Building, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in the East, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in the United States, the Association of Students Who Have Studied in France, and the Hawaii Restaurant, etc. In addition, there are many private dance parties in the style of entertainment departments.</p>
<p>Two Major Generals Learn the Foxtrot; Female Committee Members Open Dance Parties</p>
<p>Every time the lights come on, the doors of these places are crowded with all kinds of cars. It can be seen that those attending are all distinguished figures. Inside the venue, there are either neat suits or dazzling military uniforms, which are matched with the colorful spring clothes of the ladies. The graceful dance shadows are really a magnificent sight. The most popular dance in Guangzhou is the tango, followed by the waltz and the blues, rumba, etc. The "rumba hawk" and "balistrudu" that are popular in Hong Kong are rarely seen at dance parties in Guangzhou, but "full-court dances" are occasionally held. According to the reporter's investigation, recently, two major generals felt that dancing was necessary in social situations, and specially hired experts to serve as instructors. Recently, they have been seen appearing on the dance floor, and they are quite able to put their arms around their waists and do the foxtrot. It is also a fact that a certain female committee member once opened a dance party to entertain distinguished guests. From this, it can also be seen how popular dancing is here!</p>
<p>The Commercial Offensive Has Not Yet Moved; The Theater Movement Is Flourishing Everywhere</p>
<p>In the commercial field, things seem very quiet. The stores are all quiet, and there is no sign that they are preparing to launch a "spring offensive."</p>
<p>In the cultural circle, a larger event during the spring days is the theater people's celebration of the first theater festival after the victory. On February 15th, hundreds of theater people held a celebration for the Eighth Theater Festival in the People's Auditorium. After the meeting, all the theater people held a hike to visit the Japanese prisoner of war camp and Lingnan University. There is also a grand program, which is the rotation of thirteen plays performed by theater troupes from all over the city.</p>

<h3>Navigation Administration Bureau Orders Allocation of Ships to Transport Salt to Aid Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>After the victory, the need for salt in the recovered areas of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi is extremely urgent. In the past, a considerable amount was continuously transported via the Yangtze River waterway. However, the area is vast, and the supply is still insufficient. Recently, the water level of the Yangtze River has dropped, making it inconvenient for large ships to navigate, and the amount of construction and transport has also decreased, so the demand for salt is even more urgent. It is understood that the production areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Huai have abundant reserves, but only lack ships for transportation. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Communications recently ordered the Navigation Administration Bureau in this city to order all shipping agencies to give priority to allocating ships to quickly transport the salt stored in this city to the recovered areas of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, and to send ships to the production areas of Zhejiang to transport. After receiving the instructions from the Navigation Administration Bureau, the shipping companies are unifying plans. It is reported that the Dahua vessel of the Ping An Shipping Bureau returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday with a large amount of salt. In addition, the Minglun vessel of the Sanbei Company is expected to arrive in port today, also carrying more than 5,000 packages of salt from Fuzhou.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Vocational Youths Hope to Change Professions</h3>
<p>Difficult to Achieve Now, Must Wait for the Future</p>
<p>Dear Editor, your newspaper's social services have long been trusted by the public, and even ignorant people like our group of young apprentices trust you extremely. We are a group of 15-16 year old youths, primary school graduates, who are apprentices in tailor shops and cigarette stores. We entered these small industries because of economic pressure or other circumstances. Our original aspirations were to work in railways or transportation. However, things did not go as we wished. Sir, I am a young person, and like every young person, I need to work enthusiastically. How can I just wither away like this? Sir, although I have never met you, I believe you are a warm-hearted person who will not abandon us. Therefore, I am raising this question for you to answer and hope you can tell us whether there are any opportunities now to become railway workers and whether food and lodging are provided. I believe there are many people who have the same experiences and hopes as us, and this will make people who have similar experiences endlessly grateful. Respectfully wishing you good health, from vocational youths Ma Xueqi and twelve others.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: You are all ambitious young people. Do not be fickle and should adapt to circumstances. This is not opposing your ambition, but under the current circumstances, you cannot freely choose your profession. You must wait until economic construction has reached considerable success before you can obtain a good profession. As the saying goes, "There are 360 professions, and every profession can produce a champion." For now, we can only view it this way. As for wanting to work in railways and transportation, it is not impossible to achieve the goal when there is an opportunity. Brief reply provided, do you agree?</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Disputes in the Newspaper Industry: Authorities Distribute Arbitration Awards</h3>
<p>Settlement Reached in Western Restaurant and Coffee Shop Labor Strike</p>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Industry Workers' Union previously requested a wage increase from the employers, stipulating that from February of this year, the base monthly salary for workers would be calculated based on the average wage of 55 yuan per worker in 1937. The adjustment of salaries would be based on the worker's cost of living index published by the municipal government. The employers did not agree to this request, so the arbitration committee appointed by the municipal government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union discussed the matter several times and decided on the arbitration award on March 2nd, which has been delivered to both parties. The main points are as follows: The employers should increase wages starting from February of this year. The method of increasing wages is as follows: (A) The employers should individually negotiate the base wage with each worker, based on the worker's skills, service experience, past practices of each newspaper, and business conditions, within a range of 30 yuan to 50 yuan in legal tender. Then multiply by the total worker's cost of living index for the current month. (B) Subsequent monthly wages will be adjusted according to the total worker's cost of living index for each month.</p>
<p>Workers in the Western restaurant and coffee shop industry in this city have been on strike for some time, and after several mediation attempts by the Bureau of Social Affairs, a satisfactory resolution has been reached. The workers will resume work uniformly today. Yesterday, the employers' representative Wang Zhen, the workers' representative Zhu Shifa, and five others, along with Zhu Guilin from the Bureau of Social Affairs and Fang Rusheng from the Municipal Party Headquarters, signed the mediation record at the Jin Gu Hotel.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Letterpress Printing Workers' Union sent representatives to negotiate with the employers' association on the 23rd of last month. The workers requested adjustments to the four basic living benefits: (1) A minimum monthly salary of 45 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index for the current month, and implemented from February. (2) Two meals and one bowl of porridge per day. (3) Implementation of a 128-hour work system, with night work counted as five hours per shift. (4) All Sundays and national holidays are to be off. After several rounds of negotiation, the employers did not agree, leading to a work slowdown.</p>
<h3>Leather Goods Workers Beaten for Urging Work Stoppage</h3>
<p>Six with Bloody Heads</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Because of requests for better treatment, the Leather Goods Workers' Union in this city had previously requested mediation from the Bureau of Social Affairs, but no resolution has been reached. Therefore, the union recently sent dozens of workers to various leather suitcase and leather goods workshops to urge a work stoppage. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, several workers from the union went to the Da Kang Leather Goods Workshop at No. 84, Yong Cheng Li, East Da Ming Road. The owner, Liu Mingji, and his son, Shi De, seeing them arrive, secretly gathered more than 30 dockworkers from the Qing Gang gang, who arrived with iron rulers and other weapons and surrounded the workers and beat them, leaving six with bloody heads. The injured were then taken to the Hu Dong Hospital by the police officers on duty. After the incident was reported, the union gathered more than 200 workers and rushed to the scene. The Tilanqiao Branch Bureau also dispatched a large number of armed police and security forces to suppress the situation. The police bureau took Liu Mingji and his son into custody for investigation.</p>

<h3>Amidst Fluctuations in Gold: A Summary of Market Conditions for the Week</h3>
<p>This past week, financial assets have fluctuated under governmental decrees including a decision to open the foreign exchange market, causing market participants to experience a period of uncertainty, and initiating decline in the trading volume and price of foreign currencies. This weakness spread to other goods, with slight declines noted in all sectors. As market participants see that open trade is forthcoming, hoarders began to take a cautious approach. Although there are still occasional blips and dips, such movements are much more narrow in scope, unlike the violent swings of the past. Gold prices fell from 1.72 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 1.42 million yuan on Saturday. The price of the US dollar also declined from 2,500 yuan to around 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Private trading of Chinese stocks on Monday was sluggish with minimal demand and two "hot" stocks and three smaller ones trending downward. On Thursday, liquidity shifted when Northern trading groups began to aggressively buy, causing a dramatic upward trend. Meiya rose above 2,000 yuan and textile mills rose to 2,750 yuan. A return to downtrends was observed on Saturday.</p>
<p>The trend of foreign stocks mirrored that of Chinese stocks, with ambiguity at the start of the week and rising strength observed beginning Thursday. Retreating strength returned on Saturday.</p>
<p>Government bonds exhibited weakness at the beginning of the week, with type C bonds falling as low as 1,450 yuan. Liquidity returned again on Wednesday, causing a surge in prices. On Saturday, rumors of government investigators caused prices to recede slightly.</p>
<p>In the past week, the spot market for cotton yarns saw a decline due to the falling price of gold. Buyers from Guangdong and Wuhan, major purchasers, reduced their activity relative to the previous week, causing participants who held physical cotton to sell as prices rose, leading to downward pressure on the market. The fabric market started out with tightness in supply but gradually weakened in line with gold and yarn prices. As for the raw cotton market, the primary source of demand was Fangjian Corporation, which aggressively purchased high-grade fine cotton such as 42 and 32-count. Transactions of Mitterlin cotton were particularly high. Beyond this, inventories held by textile mills were sufficient to satisfy their demand, leading to low demand and the prices of high-grade fine cotton remaining average, with coarse-grade seed cotton performing weaker. Overall, Mitterlin cotton rose by 4,000 yuan. Dasun, Jisan, Yu Zhen, Brazilian, Xiasha, and fire-engine cotton remained largely unchanged. Seed cotton from Zhoupu saw a decline of 3,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Within the past week, the value of spot rayon dropped by a massive 500,000 yuan through Thursday. There are three main reasons for this. First, warehouse receipts for Tongfa warehouses can be used to withdraw actual rayon. Second, the practice of trading in warehouse receipts has been restricted to reduce speculation. Third, the price of gold crashed, forcing the rayon market to follow the overall trend. From Friday onward, prices rebounded by over 100,000 yuan, for a total weekly decline of 350,000 yuan. Semi-gloss rayon was in high demand, trading at a 100,000 yuan premium above gloss rayon on Tuesday, and losing 200,000 yuan overall. Individual dealers in textile goods were experiencing losses between 200,000 and 250,000 yuan, and the volume of trade over the week was quite limited. Meanwhile, the occasional transaction of Dan silk was completed under accommodating terms with five-day promissory notes. Amongst silk fabrics, Meiya blanket covers and Dacheng Ge Bi crepe experienced heavy declines from Tuesday to Thursday but experienced a rebound from buyers trying to take advantage of low prices on Friday. Overall, the weekly change in Meiya blanket cover prices was a loss of 15,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Ge Bi crepe lost 460 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice prices saw a minor recovery at the beginning of the week but experienced a rising trend overall due to limited supplies caused by days of rain. In contrast, the price of flour remained relatively stable due to the availability of CRRRA flour.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Organize Anhui Tea Company, Capital of 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Anhui produces tea of excellent quality and abundant quantity, which has always been sold domestically and internationally, with exports being particularly significant. Qimen black tea and Tunxi green tea have long been famous. Before the war, the annual output was several hundred thousand boxes. Xu Shiying and others specifically united various tea merchants to organize a large-scale Anhui Tea Company. The Anhui Provincial Government also participated in the share capital. The business goal is mainly export and secondarily domestic sales. The company helps tea farmers, improves production technology, enhances quality, reduces costs, and provides production funds. With the tea season approaching this year, it plans to establish tea farms while cooperating with existing tea farms and tea houses in various producing areas, planning to produce 14,000 boxes of Qihong, 20,000 boxes of Tun green, and 2,500 dan of Qing tea. It is rumored that its capital is 200 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Commercial Survey: Recent Situation of Shanghai Silk Weaving Factories</h3>
<p>Silk weaving factories, since the fall of Shanghai, have suffered various illegal destructions by the enemy, such as restricting electricity, even cutting off supply, forcing them to stop work. Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, less than one or two out of ten were operating, most relying on self-installed wood-burning engines, struggling to survive. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, electricity was universally supplied, and now more than 300 factories have resumed work, with a total of more than 5,000 looms. The vicissitudes of change during this period are not worth mentioning. Here is a brief account of the current general situation.</p>
<p>Recent Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The larger-scale Shanghai silk weaving factories, such as Meiya, Dacheng, Xinda, Dangqiang, Rongfeng, Baida, Jiuchang, etc., own seventy or eighty to one or two hundred looms each. Most of the other small factories have ten to thirty or forty looms. At present, electricity is generally supplied, and all factories have started work after connecting to electricity. However, a portion has not fully started work due to the difficulty in hiring workers temporarily, and the high cost of raw materials, with the price of goods not covering costs. In December of last year, there was a strike that lasted for more than twenty days. Later, it was resolved through mediation by the authorities, and work resumed. Most factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday on January 28th or 29th and resumed work on February 7th or 8th.</p>
<p>Internal Organization of Silk Factories</p>
<p>The organization of a silk factory depends on its size, but the general situation does not go beyond the following sections: The workshop section requires someone familiar with mechanical structures as a foreman to guide the loom workers. The preparation section completes the winding and doubling work. The sizing and dyeing section specializes in sizing and dyeing silk. The pattern-making section plans patterns, draws design papers, and stomps them into flower books. The ironworkers and carpenters are equipped to repair machinery. Others, such as warping, joining threads, reeling ends, shaking yarns, and winding silk, each perform their duties. Furthermore, it is necessary to hire an experienced person who can design and manufacture goods as the factory manager to oversee all affairs within the factory. The development of a factory's operations is greatly related to whether the employed technical personnel are appropriate and whether the management is strict. Ordinary small silk factories are generally simple in organization due to environmental constraints. The factory manager and foreman often take care of both roles, and other work must be hired temporarily. Everything depends on others. If they want to compete in business, they will inevitably be inferior to others.</p>
<p>Products and Production Status</p>
<p>The types of products can be divided into four categories based on raw materials: silk products, rayon products, silk-rayon interwoven products, and yarn-rayon interwoven products. They can also be simply classified as fancy goods, men's goods, and commodity goods. Fancy goods include the currently popular black and white crepe and brocade satin. Pure rayon fabrics, such as black and white crepe, use 100 or 75 matte yarn with a shrinkage pocket structure. Each loom can produce twelve or thirteen meters per day. Brocade satin uses 100 bright yarn, and daily output is about ten meters. Tianxiang silk, Caizhi silk, Weixin crepe, etc., are silk-rayon interwoven products, and each machine can weave twelve meters. Checkered Bi crepe has men's and women's styles. Those woven entirely from silk are better, while silk-rayon interwoven ones are less durable. The production volume per machine is about ten meters. Quilt covers have distinctions between pure silk, rayon, and yarn-rayon interwoven. The width of the loom is one-third wider than ordinary silk looms, and daily production is between five and six meters. Commodity goods such as Hua Jin crepe, feather yarn, and Guangming satin can produce about twenty-five meters per machine. Di ge is woven from yarn and rayon, and the production volume is similar to Hua Jin crepe, etc. However, the amount of production mentioned above still depends on the newness of the loom, the speed of the dobby (fast dobby or guillotine dobby), and the experience of the weaver, and cannot be compared on the same day.</p>
<p>Sales Channels and Raw Material Problems</p>
<p>In the past, the sales channels for silk goods, especially real silk goods, were most extensive in the north. Other groups such as the Guangdong group and the Hankou group also had strong sales channels. The Nanyang group had special sales for Western-style clothing silk and satin, with different colors and patterns from other groups. The local market mostly sells fancy goods. Currently, transportation has not yet returned to its original state, and none of the groups are making large purchases, so sales have not been prosperous. Currently, goods are being shipped to the Sichuan area via airmail parcels, but the volume is not large. In the future, when transportation is smooth, the sales channels for silk goods are expected to be promising. As for raw materials, the sealed warehouse materials have not been fully released, and inventory is dwindling. There is a shortage of goods on the market. For example, rayon is currently only being consumed without a source of supply. Recognizing this, the authorities have ordered Zhongshan Textile Company to sell 1,500 boxes of the sealed rayon to silk weaving factories at a reduced price. Therefore, the market price once declined. Factory silk is one of the export goods, and the price rises with the value of gold. The inventory is decreasing day by day, and holders often hoard goods, creating a panic situation to satisfy their desire for high prices. The situation with raw materials is indeed not good news for silk weaving factories. (Mu Yi)</p>

<h3>US to Use Radio for Re-education in Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Education Standards Not High</p>
<p>[US News Agency, San Francisco, 1st] General Clark stated to a special correspondent of the American Broadcasting Corporation on the 26th: In terms of the Japanese post-war problems, the position of radio is very important. Tank is currently the Minister of Education and Information in Tokyo, and from 1943 until assuming his current position, he served as the head of the Intelligence and Education Department of MacArthur Headquarters. According to Tank's words to reporters: Any country that has been poisoned by war education will use radio and other methods to enlighten them on facts such as international understanding and freedom of speech. General Tank and his subordinates used newspapers, magazines, movies, and other tools to conduct re-education in Japan, but the results were not good because the "high cultural standards" boasted by the Japanese were not accurate. The Japanese claim that 99.6% of the population are intellectuals, but in reality, only one in ten people in Tokyo can recite the names of Japanese war criminals on the notification board. It is impossible to implement re-education in Japan without using radio.</p>

<h3>Two Measures for Labor Welfare</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Labor Department initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Municipal Factory Employee Consumer Cooperative" to supply members with low-priced daily necessities, increase workers' actual wages, and aim to send out goods based on the cost of living. The third preparatory meeting has been convened, attended by representatives from 50 units, including Shanghai Electric Power Company, Telephone Company, Wing On, Fuxin Yarn Factory, Textile Industry, Machinery Industry, and Tobacco Industry Trade Union, who are actively preparing to proceed. The sources of funds include three types, namely (1) factories allocate a certain amount as promotional shares, (2) if there is a welfare fund, a portion may be allocated, and (3) employees subscribe for shares.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau also has a measure for labor welfare, which is to specially contract with Haiguang Cinema on Haining Road, Minguang Cinema on Zhapu Road, and Shengli Cinema from this month onwards to rotate labor-themed movies every Sunday morning. The content of the films focuses on production and construction, current affairs news, and those related to labor life with educational significance. Tickets are given away for free. Labor groups in this city can send a letter to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau every Thursday and Friday to obtain them.</p>
<p>These two measures can indeed be said to be suitable for the current environment. The former can solve the material problems of labor life, while the latter can solve the spiritual problems of labor life. Originally, general manufacturers have not failed to think about the welfare of labor. Looking at the labor-management cooperation and all the facilities of foreign manufacturers, it is really enviable. However, because the manufacturers themselves still have many problems that have not been solved, and even reach the point of being exhausted in coping with them, they cannot take care of the welfare of labor for a while. Now that the Social Affairs Bureau is in charge, it can really achieve twice the result with half the effort, so these two initiatives can be said to be a kind of good governance of the Social Affairs Bureau at present.</p>
<p>The former can indeed fundamentally solve the problem of labor life. We hope that the management can be as satisfactory as possible. Then, not only will labor benefit first, but the stability of social order and the cultivation of purchasing power can also achieve considerable effects. As for the latter, we hope that the films shown will be carefully selected. At the same time, if the film business is effective, it can be expanded to other aspects of the supply of spiritual food, such as setting up libraries, holding academic lectures, and publishing beneficial books and reports.</p>
<h3>The Founder of the Stationery and Educational Construction Factory: He Ji Educational Supplies Company</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Currently, China urgently desires the construction of education. Regarding educational materials, it is imperative to first engage in production construction. As culture becomes increasingly developed and the level of education continuously rises, educational supplies are also gradually becoming more scientific and artistically refined, changing with each passing day. China has long been a country where commerce is not prosperous and science lags behind. Amidst the calls for encouraging production and prioritizing educational construction in nation-building, I am pleased to introduce Mr. Xiaotang, an industrialist with a pragmatic spirit, dedicated to production work, and earnestly assisting education, and Mr. Wang Fuqing, who carries on his aspirations.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is a respectable industrialist who engages in industrial construction in a down-to-earth manner, without the slightest air of commercialism. He possesses the perseverance and determination necessary for handling affairs. In his early years, Mr. Fuqing studied in Germany. After returning to China, he assisted Mr. Xiaotang in managing the operations of He Ji Educational Supplies Company. He guided the company to be at the forefront of the times with the latest ideas, implemented management with scientific methods, and carried out transactions with innovative and legitimate steps. The company preserved its excellent and reasonable established rules, while resolutely reforming its corrupt and harmful bad habits. As a result, colleagues were invigorated, and business flourished. Under Mr. Wang's management, He Ji established an unshakeable foundation.</p>
<p>During the first ten years after He Ji was founded, Mr. Xiaotang, recognizing the outflow of national currency, engaged in the production of manufacturing plants, specializing in the production of various important educational supplies such as chalk, paper, and ink. They gained countless customers with the principle of "honest goods at fair prices." Stationery merchants from various outports, such as the Sichuan gang, Xi'an gang, Hankou gang, and Changsha gang, sympathized with He Ji's practical transactions and were happy to purchase and sell He Ji's products. As a result, domestic goods were promoted, and considerable profits were recovered. To this day, the "EK" brand printing ink and other products from the China Central Factory still hold a prominent position in the market. This is because He Ji consistently adheres to the principle of "honest goods at fair prices" and practices faithful transactions.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Wang's hard work fortunately escaped the artillery fire. However, during the August 13th Incident, as the flames of war raged, the production facilities founded by Mr. Wang could not escape destruction by enemy artillery fire. Unable to do otherwise, he devised a plan to gradually move materials inland, from Hankou to Changsha, then to Hengyang, Chongqing, and Kunming. Following the National Army everywhere, he gradually relocated, further experiencing Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Guilin, and other places, establishing offices in various locations in the hope of maintaining contact. Unfortunately, every place was ravaged by the enemy. The transported goods suffered considerable losses due to bombing or direct involvement in the war. According to Mr. Wang, a batch of inland-moved goods still exists in Zhenhai. In June of last year, just as he was preparing to transport it inland, enemy agents from the so-called Political Security Corps Ningbo Branch considered it aiding the enemy and seized it. After the peace, Mr. Wang requested the Zhejiang authorities to return it, but no results have been seen so far. In total, the damage suffered by the inland-moved goods is substantial. Mr. Wang, with an indomitable spirit, waged a passive resistance against the enemy in terms of materials until peace.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Wang's spirit is even more aroused, hoping to dedicate his entire strength to nation-building. The businesses destroyed in the past are being revived. He will contribute a large amount of production to the construction of education and work harder to improve business, rigorously organizing personnel, business operations, production, finance, and employee treatment. For example, recently in Shanghai, there has been a wave of strikes and work slowdowns everywhere. The labor and management of the Eight Great Companies and the Commercial Press, among others, have had disputes over unfair treatment. However, He Ji's management has a deep understanding of the labor force, with salaries originally set at a relatively high level, sufficient to maintain the necessities of life. In addition to providing employees with lodging, they also provide suitable housing for employees' families, with employee dormitories, so that employees do not feel the hardship of life. Therefore, every employee is able to [whitespace] , thus enabling the enterprise to [whitespace] into a higher degree of [whitespace]. In short, Mr. Wang wants to [whitespace] He Ji into the most ideal and progressive industrial and commercial entity, making it forever the front [whitespace] of society and always [whitespace] a strong member dedicated to nation-building.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang not only considers the future of He Ji's business, but also holds a greater enthusiasm for the stationery industry and commerce nationwide. He hopes that stationery merchants can unite to organize a research institute dedicated to research work, thoroughly improving the quality and structure of domestic products, competing with imported goods, and recovering the commercial profits of the entire educational supplies industry. I cannot help but be touched by Mr. Wang's enthusiasm. If all industries in our country's business community have the organization and determination to work hard, then the revitalization of Chinese commerce, the construction of industry, and the recovery of the commercial profits of the entire nation can undoubtedly be expected in the near future.</p>
<p>He Ji was founded in the third year of Xuantong (1911), and can be said to be among the earliest founders of the educational supplies industry. During the Xuantong era, China's situation was still quite outdated. Most corrupt-minded Chinese people only knew "the Four Treasures of the Study" as the only stationery. Specialized stationery businesses were rarely seen in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Xiaotang resolutely founded He Ji Educational Supplies Company, indeed possessing a unique industrial vision. When we further investigate the reasons for his success, these various aspects naturally have value worthy of emulation by later generations. The following points may be important factors in his success:</p>
<p>(1) Honest goods at fair prices, being realistic and pragmatic, without making false propaganda;</p>
<p>(2) Firmly pursuing goals, engaging in the promotion of domestic products, and gaining the sympathy of customers;</p>
<p>(3) Effective management, cooperation between labor and management.</p>
<p>The above points seem very simple, but putting them into practice is not easy. Those with aspirations in industry should take this as a mirror.</p>
<p>Finally, I think it is also worth mentioning Mr. Fuqing's character. His attitude is gentle, his demeanor is refined, and he is usually quiet and taciturn. He not only inherits Mr. Xiaotang's ambition to expand the business, but also wishes to dedicate his business achievements to nation-building. This is truly commendable. Mr. Fuqing also enjoys reading and has a rich collection of books at home. He studied art history extensively in Germany. From this, we know that Mr. Fuqing is not only an industrialist but also a scholar. I have a slight artistic hobby and would like to ask for his guidance someday.</p>
<h3>The Road to Production Construction</h3>
<p>— Xu Yusun</p>
<p>Mr. Yusun presides over China's long-standing Jinglun Shirts and Socks Textile Factory, handling it with skill and exporting high-quality products. What this journal describes is indeed targeted at reality and has many practical suggestions worth adopting. Please pay attention, readers - Editor.</p>
<p>Production construction is a primary task necessary for the country's hope for post-war recovery. Half a year has passed since the end of World War II. We look around and see that everything is lacking everywhere in the world. In the past four years, industrialized countries in Europe and America have converted most of their factories into institutions for manufacturing military supplies due to the needs of the war. Large watch factories such as American Hamilton and Elgin have commissioned Swiss watch factories to do their original work. Ero Lingerie Factory has also converted the civilian underwear part into a factory for manufacturing military uniforms. With the end of the war, most of the millions of troops have to return to their original jobs and lives, and with the huge demand for clothing and daily necessities from the general public after four years of war, while the work of refitting factory machinery has not yet been completed, naturally a general shortage of materials has been created. However, in countries with well-developed industrial equipment, restoring production is not very difficult, because technology already has a solution—in fact, with years of manufacturing experience, it has made progress in many ways—and there are no major problems with raw materials and transportation. Embarking on the road of production construction can be realized in a short period.</p>
<p>In our country, talking about production construction after the war is not that simple. The few cities that can be called industrial centers have either been destroyed by artillery fire in the past eight years, or have been plundered into extreme poverty by the puppets. Manufacturers who were fortunate enough to move inland or remain in Shanghai to start work have all reduced their production and sales volume compared to before due to restrictions on raw materials and transportation. Among these factories and technicians in shutdown factories, some have changed careers due to their livelihood, some have reduced their work efficiency due to age, and some have even passed away. Moreover, most of our country's factories are small and medium-sized. After eight years of torment, hardship, and consumption, it is now a bit too much to expect them to rely entirely on their own to restore production and increase production, and in fact it is impossible. The government authorities, in view of this, have a solution for industrial foundation loans. This is good news for factories, and it is a driving force for promoting production construction. However, there are currently several obstacles that we urgently need to eliminate as quickly as possible. Technology, machinery, raw materials, and government assistance are still difficult to smoothly embark on the path of production construction.</p>
<p>Transportation: During the Anti-Japanese War, our country's water and land transportation suffered unprecedented destruction. Recently, the communist army dismantled a part of the repaired railway, making travel and transportation extremely difficult today. China's transportation has regressed at least fifty years! This situation greatly affects the shortage of raw materials and finished materials, fluctuating prices, and imbalances in supply and demand. Therefore, restoring and improving our country's transportation and transportation institutions can almost be considered the first need for production construction.</p>
<p>Monetary System and Foreign Exchange: Before the Supreme National Defense Council passed the opening of the foreign exchange market on February 26, Shanghai's financial economy can be said to have been in a state of chaos. Speculators were afraid that the world would not be in chaos, so they stirred up trouble and created many seemingly true and seemingly false rumors. As a result, prices fluctuated with these rumors, which in turn affected the unstable prices of industrial raw materials such as cotton yarn, cloth, hardware, and chemicals. Factories engaged in production naturally felt great difficulties in the purchase price and cost of goods. Although the government's new foreign exchange regulations cannot completely solve their difficulties, we believe that it can at least curb some speculative behavior and stabilize the prices of goods and raw materials.</p>
<p>The opening of the foreign exchange market case divides the import of foreign goods into three categories: free, licensed, and prohibited. We firmly believe that this is a policy that is helpful to our country's production construction. We hope that the government authorities will determine the details of these three types of foreign goods as soon as possible and strictly implement the established methods. For private factories that actually need foreign machinery and raw materials, and whose products are related to people's livelihood, we hope that the government will provide convenience and preferential treatment in terms of requesting foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Understanding and Cooperation between Officials and the People: We cannot deny that the lack of understanding and cooperation between the government and the people is a major obstacle to production construction. The general business community's view of official policies is: unreasonable, unrealistic, delayed, and demanding, while the government authorities are always wary of the business community's perfunctory behavior, evasion, and lip service. We believe that both sides should be open and honest. The business community should state its own interests, difficulties, and opinions to the officials without any scruples. Before implementing any industrial and commercial laws or tax rules, the government should thoroughly research them based on existing facts, and sometimes invite people in the industry to participate in opinions, so as to avoid causing multiple criticisms as soon as the policies are published, and the result is often to take temporary suspension or revision methods. The government should use facts to show that it [whitespace] understands the difficulties and interests of the business community, and should also use facts to show that it is willing to provide the business community with reasonable and practical assistance and encouragement. The red tape of officialdom is seen as wasteful and delaying by the business community. The simpler and quicker the procedures, the better. In this way, we believe that official-civilian cooperation and understanding can be increased.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the American Production Industry</h3>
<p>— Qinghe</p>
<p>The American people have always had [whitespace] great purchasing power, but since the start of World War II, the government implemented extremely supplementary [whitespace] time restrictions, so they could not purchase according to [whitespace] each person's [whitespace], which saved a lot of money, according to statistics, there are as many as 150 billion yuan, the superior instruction [whitespace] money after the end of the war, is about to be used to purchase all kinds of consumables that could not be bought before.</p>
<p>According to the US Department of Commerce survey, the US industrial community has reached an unprecedented level of international awareness, and factories have also decided to allocate 6% to 15% of their total production for export, regardless of the domestic market.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of products, the following types are the most noteworthy, may [whitespace] be divided as follows:</p>
<p>Automobile Industry: According to estimates, by the end of 1946, the national production will reach 6 million vehicles, including 1 million to 1.5 million [whitespace] trucks.</p>
<p>Radio Industry: According to records in 1941, the sales volume of radio receivers in the United States was 13 million units. It is estimated that the demand for radios after the war will increase fourfold compared to 1941.</p>
<p>Electrical Equipment: The demand for electrical equipment is also very large, so large-scale production will be launched in one year. Most electrical industrialists are prepared to export 15% of their products. By 1945, the number of electric water heaters exceeded 150,000 units, and it is expected to increase even more in 1946.</p>
<p>Fertilizer: The consumption of fertilizer in the United States is quite large, and it had increased to 13 million [whitespace] per year by 1942, and will undoubtedly increase even more in 1946.</p>
<p>Vaccines: Since the invention of the vaccine DDT, demand has exceeded supply. It is said that domestic consumption can be satisfied within one year, and then the surplus [whitespace] amount can be exported.</p>
<p>Textiles: The production of textiles in the United States reached its highest [whitespace] in 1942, and then declined due to the war. Large-scale production will be carried out in the future to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Production Dynamics</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>New Colloid</p>
<p>A year ago, the advertising director of General Electric threw a pack of cigarettes into the river to a group of newspaper reporters, and after waiting for a while, took it out. After the water stains flowed away, the cigarettes were not damaged at all. The reason for this is the use of a new colloid (Plastic). This is an [whitespace] invention in the last thirty years, [whitespace] Yun [whitespace] Gong's [whitespace] and Chemical Company, Corning Glass Manufacturing [whitespace], and General Electric Company.</p>
<p>The raw materials for this colloid are [whitespace] oil [whitespace] water and sand, [whitespace] [whitespace] into a foggy [whitespace] gas [whitespace], after it is sprayed, it will not get wet, that is, moisture will not penetrate. This spraying method can be applied to cigarettes or other [whitespace].</p>
<p>Using this method, various new [whitespace] things can be made, such as paper bags used by grocers to hold food, temporary rain hats sold in large quantities during ball games, and a kind of colloid that can be applied to light clothing and even leather shoes to get rainproof effect.</p>
<p>Professor Gilpin and students at the University of Nottingham in England studied this colloid, starting forty years ago, and have set a manufacturing plan. Ten years ago, Dr. Sullivan of Corning Glass Manufacturing decided to study the difference between colloids and glass, using Professor Gilpin's research results as a basis. Later, he joined forces with Dehe Chemical Company, and as a result invented a new colloid called Sililone. In the future, in terms of paint, after the harvest is [whitespace] benefit, the heat resistance is very high. At General Electric, it has been tested, even at a high heat of 482 degrees Fahrenheit, there is still no damage at all.</p>
<h3>Absorb New Ideas</h3>
<p>— Wang Jing</p>
<p>There is a very good slogan at the University of Chicago's DePaul, which is "The most capable person is the one who can make the best use of outside opinions." Because every industrial and commercial practitioner cannot rely solely on his own creative power, but must refer to and apply outside opinions.</p>
<p>Those novel ideas can be obtained from books, observations, conversations, travels and other opportunities. In fact, such information can be obtained everywhere. As long as you are willing to look for it, you can discover novel facts or reference materials everywhere, which can be applied.</p>
<p>There was a story in the past that, according to the experience of general people [whitespace] [whitespace] zers: it was thought that gold could not be mined [whitespace] on the top of the mountain, but in fact one day a person really obtained a large amount of gold on the top of the mountain. From this example, we can know that as long as you [whitespace] pay attention or work hard to find it, you can get good information everywhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes the information obtained from the outside world can be applied immediately without any further changes, but sometimes it needs to be changed considerably. There was a car manufacturer in the past who went out with his wife to visit a weaving factory and discovered a very good idea, which he applied immediately. Patterson, the originator of adding [whitespace], had the motive of [whitespace] creating adding [whitespace] when he sold coal.</p>
<p>There was a very smart person in the past who used letters to promote electrical and mechanical appliances. In fact, the letters he used were referenced from a letter selling soap, but with slight changes [whitespace] only.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to record various new ideas at any time, everyone can prepare a small booklet, and when a new idea is discovered, they can write it down and apply it at any time. To make a business always move forward, it needs to be constantly new ideas and new things. The Duke of Windsor once said: "My must be adopted, revised, improved" We Must Acopt Adapt Improve is indeed a wise saying, which can be used as the motto of industrial and commercial practitioners.</p>
<h3>Three Types of Supervisors</h3>
<p>— Fu Liangjun</p>
<p>According to the British Efficiency Magazine [whitespace], supervisors can be divided into the following three types. The first type can stand in front of the times and can lead the same industry. The second type seeks progress within the possible scope. The third type will not progress even if someone is pushing it. Therefore, the first type can be said to be the most progressive, the second type can be called still progressive, and the third type is actually backward.</p>
<p>The modern industrial world hopes to have the first type of supervisor who can stand in front of the staff and lead them. If there is a new invention or a new equipment is found, he will immediately apply it. His thinking is always progressing.</p>
<p>At the same time, he not only seeks progress within the scope of the company, but also constantly pays attention to the outside world's dynamics, so his career can improve day by day and can have rapid progress.</p>
<p>As for the second type of person, they can only adapt to the environment, and the third type of person will inevitably be dominated by the environment and cannot [whitespace] be the most developed.</p>
<h3>China Silk Company</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, we introduced the China Textile Construction Company. Now we will introduce the general situation of the China Silk Company as follows:</p>
<p>The total sauce amount of the China Silk Company, in addition to receiving the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, which were settled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry, plus 500 million yuan, which was allocated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry in one lump sum. The head office is located in Shanghai, and branch companies, offices, and factory sites can be established in various places at home and abroad. In terms of business scope, it is divided into the following items:</p>
<p>1. Sericulture matters related to silkworm breeding and cultivation, 2. Silk [whitespace]'s [whitespace] manufacturing matters, 3. Processing and weaving matters of natural silk, 4. Transportation and sales matters of finished products, 5. Academic research matters brought about by silkworms and silk, 6. Guidance and encouragement matters for private sericulture businesses.</p>
<p>The directors and supervisors of the company are selected jointly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Tan Boyu, Tan Xihong, Xue Shouyi, Zhou Yichun, Fa Shenyu, Ma Baozhi, Leng [whitespace],? Fu Cheng, Gao Shiheng, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xixiang and other eleven people are directors, Chen Yu, Zhang Ziwen. Chang Zonghui, Zheng Qun [whitespace], Shao Shenpei and other five people are supervisors, and Zhou Yichun also serves as chairman, and Ge Jingzhong is hired by the board of directors as general manager.</p>
<p>According to recent news, the company has ordered 2 million mulberry seedlings from Japan in order to restore the mulberry gardens destroyed during the war, and the first batch of 800,000 seedlings arrived in Shanghai the other day, and is discussing with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on how to handle the accumulation [whitespace].</p>
<h3>Absences Prolong the War</h3>
<p>The United States did its best to produce various items during the war. There was a slogan in the Kos, Read wartime factory that said "Absences Prolong the War" Absence Makes The War Grow Longer is indeed a very moving slogan, with profound meaning.</p>
<h3>The Growth and Trial of a Career</h3>
<p>— Luo Liqun</p>
<p>No matter what kind of career grows, it will inevitably encounter many difficulties in the process. These difficulties are the trial of the success or failure of the career. When we encounter difficulties, we must overcome this difficult journey. For the career, we must have a deep belief, perseverance, and calm [whitespace] handling. When Feilun Money Factory was first established, because the matter was a pioneering one, it inevitably encountered many difficulties, but because it adhered to its purpose, it finally solved many difficulties. For example, after the August 13th Incident, many factories in Shanghai were either disbanded or moved inland. Feilun Factory now has no way to move inland, and sales have stalled. As a result, it gained new development in Nanyang. However, after the Pacific War broke out, sales were interrupted. Then, the purchase of gauze and raw materials became a problem again, but even under difficult circumstances, it worked hard and finally overcame the difficulties. Therefore, due to past experience, I feel that any difficulty can be solved. I think everyone engaged in industry has the same feeling.</p>
