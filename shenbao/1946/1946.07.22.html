<h3 id="c1">馬帥今日自牯返京　時局將有新決定　美使謂前途希望仍濃 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕首都政治商談空氣陷於停頓狀態下者已逾一週，尤以過去三日中馬歇爾特使前赴牯嶺，周恩來氏僕京滬豫上空，民盟人士則連日忙於昆明李聞被刺事件，因之俞大維對記者表示，亦僅有「光明終將來臨」一語。而邵力子氏則更能有數日之閑，於酷暑中伴同夫人納閔庭院，惟此種停頓書面，自非過長者，目前一般人揣測對象，似非「何時再談」，而為「何地再談」。聞政府方面正就廬山為各黨派布置居處，明日返京之馬帥，亦負有促請中共代表上山之使命，故截至今晚，政府代表及各黨派人士雖均無赴潯之意，然一俟馬帥及周恩來明日返京後，當有新的決定也。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿一日電〕主席發表文吿事，據主席秘書談，此事主席與司徒大使會有洽商，內容未詳，但推測有二種可能：（一）司徒大使與主席業已洽妥；（二）發表文吿為司徒與主席晤面時之意見。明日馬使到京與司徒大使會商，再與主席接洽後，當可決定主席之重要行動。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿一日電〕馬歇爾特使已決定明晨七時卅分離牯嶺下山，約十時餘可由九江乘專機起飛，將於中午前到京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕美大使司徒雷登因離平前已染感冒，抵牯嶺後氣候較涼，致咳嗽增劇。今日雖値星期，大使仍整日埋首工作，撰擬文件，但拒見賓客。下午四時在官邸接見本報記者，據稱：渠擬於廿三日返平，料理燕大蔣務，稍事勾留後，即返京，是否再去廬山，則尚未決定，但若主席電邀，當隨時前往。記者詢及大使此次在廬山與主席談話後對和平談判之意見如何？據答稱：渠對於談判前途，始終抱有希望，並相信終能尋求一合理解決辦法，因中國目前局勢與推翻滿清或對日作戰時已大不相同，蓋此乃純粹國內糾紛，雙方所以不能協調，其主要因素，乃在互相猜忌與疑懼，若能謀取進一步瞭解，則此種心理上的陰霾自能袪除。記者詢其此將需要若干時日？大使稱：「現尚不得而知」。大使又著重語記者，謂余會吿蔣主席，余為中國之友人，請勿視余為一美國大使，余祇希望能盡力協助中國求得眞正和平，目前之工作固艱鉅異常，但余決以主觀之認識，配合種種客觀材料，多多研究，謀取解決。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺廿一日電話〕主席夫婦於今日上午十時二十分，至馬使行館前之中華教堂，與馬歇爾夫婦同做禮拜，並唱讀美詩，中午十二時二十分始畢。下午六時，主席夫婦與馬帥夫婦分乘籐轎四頂，共遊大天池，七時許，至仙人洞野餐，八時餘於細雨濛濛中盡興而歸。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯廿一日電〕今日為安息日，介於牯嶺河東河西兩路間之中華基督教會，上午十一時舉行禮拜祈禱，有尊貴教友四們參加，此實為該教會史上之稀有光榮，此四位尊貴教友乃馬歇爾元帥夫婦，及蔣主席夫婦也。馬帥夫婦坐於教堂之右方首排，蔣主席夫婦并坐其後。主持祈禱者為英籍牧師張伯倫，祈禱後，由牧師引證約翰音第十一章第一節中之一段講永生之道理，并唱讚美詩多首。禮拜畢，馬帥夫婦邀蔣主席夫婦赴其行館午餐。午後六時蔣主席夫婦邀馬帥夫婦遊覽距牯嶺五華里之天池山。并就地野餐，該處為廬山最西北之峰頭，佇立遠眺，平畦一綫，馬帥夫婦及蔣主席夫婦入夜方返。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺廿一日電〕今日下午四時，蔣夫人舉行茶會，招待牯嶺舊友，內中以英美籍人士為多，抗戰期間，此等外籍人士為多，抗戰期間，此等外籍人士，始終未離匡廬。席間，夫人詳詢牯嶺被敵寇佔領後之種種殘情形。按夫人原在牯嶺別墅中藏有不少珍貴書籍，八年來散佚殆盞。今日茶會中，夫人於惋惜之餘，曾請求各舊友協助，冀能追回一部分。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿一日電〕陸軍總司令顧祝同，廿一日下午六時自京抵牯嶺，將晉謁蔣主席報吿東北之經過。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕美贈我新艦艇八艘，於今晚六時〇七分駛抵下關，迄六時卅分各艦分別停泊於指定位置。旗艦太康號領先，巨幅長旗迎風飄揚，英姿雄壯，輪埠佇候人士均跳躍歡呼，而　眾中尤多手牽幼童之年靑婦人，皆在引領長望，期待闊別年餘的海軍健兒歸來。海軍總司令部並事先佈置聯絡及招待事宜，周參謀總長亦親片歡迎，陳兼總司令誠，於處理今日　忙之公務後，晚九時亦趁車赴輪埠，再乘專備之汽艇登艦檢閱，全體海員當以最熱烈之情緒歡迎之。記者於暮色蒼茫中乘永興號小汽艇訪太康號，由副艦長黎玉　領導參觀該艦隊官兵係於卅三年十二月離祖國，次年二月抵美，當立即開始基本訓練，由美人擔任教練，我海員近千人，其中官長七十餘人，學歷有交通大學造船系者，有普通中學者，但均健康活潑，朝氣充沛，基本訓練十個月完畢，旋至古巴作進一步訓練。彼等在美時，曾參加各項競賽，且獲有最優之榮譽。旋因祖國已獲得勝利，而訓練亦已完畢，故於四月六日離古巴返國，沿途各埠備受僑胞熱烈歡迎，且致贈各種名貴禮品。七月十三日途次日本橫濱，曾受何應欽將軍檢閱，至本月十九日抵滬，今後任務，當候命令以定行止。各艦年齡甚新，太康號噸位為一千四百噸，係一九四三年所建。艦上各種與飛機及潛艇作戰之裝配均極齊全，唯因事關機密，不能列舉。記者曾與若干海員問談，發現渠等目前亟欲對以下兩種苦悶獲得解脫：一為闊別祖國已久，對國內政情不悉，一為海上生活過長，對大陸已感生疏。聞彼等在京約留一二日後，仍將駛滬。又聞新艦八艘之檢閱式，定於廿四日舉行，屆時當由陳兼總司令誠親自主持。</p>

<h3 id="c28">美國的弭戰運動 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>第二次大戰終了近年，而第三次大戰預防之聲已起，這正暗示着戰神還是威脅着我們，也就是和平之神還不能雍容華貴的光臨大地。這是多麼使人焦慮！然而焦慮是無濟於事的，我們必得努力贏得和平，努力消弭戰爭。</p>
<p>最近美國出席外長會議的代表之一，美國參議院外交委員會主席康納萊，自巴黎返國，向參議院報吿外長會議的經過情形，提出了一個預防第三次世界大戰的計劃書。這確是世界和平的福音。康納萊他對於國際政治的意見，向爲美國朝野乃至世界輿論所重視，尤其是這一個計劃書，可說是他的精心傑作。他在巴黎時，曾親身經歷外長會議的波瀾，深知世界和平的前途不容樂觀，第二次世界大戰的血跡未乾，而第三次世界大戰的危機似在醞釀之中，但是他不灰心，不失望，依然竭智盡能，擬就了這個弭戰計劃。在世界人類爭取和平尙未成功的今天，他這番誠意更加値得我們的尊敬。</p>
<p>回溯大戰期間，民主國家在軍事上雖未必能處處先佔優勢，但因各大國確能一心一德，始終無間，到底克服了任何困難而獲得最後勝利。當時有遠見的政治家，早已倡議，各國在戰後必須仍舊保持爭取勝利的精神，共同締造世界和平是敵人一旦投降，共同目標不復存在，而各國眼前的實際利害又不盡相同，於是「利令智昏」，彼此的步調異趨，疑懼猜忌的心理，也就潛滋暗長。德國屈服已逾一年，而眞正和平猶未實現，直到最近一次外長會議，始決定召開歐洲廿一國和平議，以簽訂對義·芬·羅·保·匈等五媾和條約，而對德問題，四强意見依然紛歧，須至本年十一月間重加討論。此在遠東局勢，亦復相同。日本投降，將近一年，但是歐洲僵局打不開，遠東問題更難望其單獨解決，因此遠東和平也在可望而不可即的狀態中。</p>
<p>但是第二次世界大戰，在歐洲打了六年，在遠束打了八年，美國也打了前後四年的血戰。人類受了這樣殘酷的敎訓，應該大家痛定思痛，由衷的渴望和平了！從遠東到歐洲，從歐洲到新大陸，普天之下，誰不渴望兵戈的永息？威爾基所懷「天下一家」的美夢，雖或不能立刻實現，但羅斯福總統旣倡議聯合國於前，各國又實際共同組成聯合國於後，倘我們還不能存有「天下一家」的信心，這眞是太辜負了人類自身的智慧。</p>
<p>康納萊在巴黎，目擊歐洲局勢的危機，益感未來戰禍的嚴重，乃憑其硏究所得，提出七項弭戰計劃，語重心長，無論如何，應爲有良知的人們所頌讚和擁護。大概他的計劃，要點有五：（一）美國對於一切國際交涉，均應堅决遵守法律原則及大西洋憲章所規定之正義，並勸吿其他各國，同樣爲之。（三）美國應以充分之軍隊飛機及軍艦，供給聯合國安全理事會使用，以保持世界和平。（三）美國須保持強大的海陸空三軍，以保衛本國領土及人民，並忠實履行聯合國憲章所規定之義務。（四）美國應早與有關各國簽訂協定，共同管制原子能及其他大規模毀滅人類之凶器。（五）美國應以全力援助聯合國機構之經濟曁社會福利計劃，俾能完成維持世界永久和平所必需之各種條件。</p>
<p>康納萊這個計劃，旣非過高的理想，也無新奇的立意，我們只覺得它切實易行。孔子曾說：「仁遠乎哉？吾欲仁，斯仁至矣。」我們現在也可這麼說：和平並不遠人，人類要和平，和平之神就可光降。我們要勸各大國，眞正尊重這聯合國的機構，我們要把它看成和平之神。我們要如康納萊一樣，各勸本國一面貢獻其能力於聯合國，一面服從聯合國之決議，遵守聯合國之約章，大家任何爭議，只許動口而不動手，天下就太平了。從康納萊的計劃看出，美國上下今天己洞知孤立時代早經過去，欲在國內享受和平輿繁榮，必先謀得世界的和平與安定。康納萊的計劃，就是美國本此認識，掬其誠意，向這條大道邁進的第一步。簡言之，美國已願意站在國際正義的立塲上，傾其全力，率先擁護聯合機構，使之成爲維持世界和平最有效力的工具。我們不但希望美國參衆兩院均能採取這個弭戰計劃，作爲美國今後外交政策的基本原則，同時更祈求此項立法精神，能爲全世界愛好和平的人們，尤其是有力量的大國所一致採納。我們必須尊重聯合國，必須不濫用「否決權」以削弱聯合國而使之對侵略戎首不能有所動作，然後戰後世界步入和平的新時代，可以獲得可恃的保證。</p>
<p>「止戈爲武」。美國這種弭戰運動，就是美國的武德，亦惟其美國擁有海陸空三軍充沛的武力，然後可以善用其武力，以捍衛世界的和平。我們期望弭戰運動的成功，我們尤其期望中國亦能當仁不讓，發揮「止戈爲武」的精神，以効力於世界的弭戰運動。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕白宮今日發表美戰略轟炸調查之最近報告書。此項報告書係由狄利爾領導之平民專家所草擬，文長三十頁，對於現代戰爭中之制空檻，始終異常注重，並根據廣大之調查，提出若干建議，主張由議會通　法案，統一美國各種軍隊於一個國防部下除陸海軍外，應有一同等之空軍，負責對於外來之　程攻擊，作消極及積極防禦，並用飛機或飛箭作戰略攻擊。當太平洋戰爭初起時，美國之戰略情報，較之德日兩國殊嫌不足，並忽略研究工作。將來國難時期，若再缺乏情報，必至貽患無窮。目前原子轟炸之發展，指示戰爭之基本原則依然不變，惟原子兵器將使人力與軍械之使用範圍大為改變，致在設備，訓練及戰術方面須有根本改革。報告書中另提出三項建議，（一）注重研究工作，使美國居於世界領導地位，每年需用之研究與發展經費當達十億美元，以保障相當程度之國防安全。（二）改善諜報，目前各機關之諜報工作不負責任，幹練之諜報人員殊形缺乏，不免勇起驚惶，亟需改正。（三）以武裝力量維持和平。美國現為強國之一，應準備起而保衛法律，並履行其應有職務，以保證他　連守條約。美國欲成為維持和平之一種勢力，不獨須具此志願，並須具有此力量云。</p>

<p>〔路透社伊斯坦埠二十日電〕土耳其人民定於明日選舉國會議員四六五名，此次係依西方民主方式而選舉，爲士國前所未有者。此採用者乃全民選舉及直接投票制，反對黨亦首次得以公然競選。共和人民黨即政府黨之獲勝，已在意料之中。反對黨中之最有力者民主黨，在士國六十三省之四十六省中，參加競選，候選人共二七三人，在其餘十七省中，人民黨並無對手。近各地時有衛突之消息，阿丁村附近又有兩人遇害。</p>

<h3 id="c44">印度的獨立運動 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>從這次大戰以後，亞洲只存下了三個大國家，中國，蘇聯，和印度。中蘇都為獨立自主的國家，特別這次對於反侵略的戰爭，一舉而粉碎軸心的迷夢，證明着中蘇兩大國族的生存和獨立，已獲得很大的成功。獨印度的獨立問題，奮鬥多年，尚待實現，中國和印度毗鄰相處，自不得不寄以極大的關懷。</p>
<p>印度在我國的西南，人口近四萬萬，她有古　的文化，富厚的資源，並有和我們相同的蒙古種民族。當我們的海口一一爲日敵封鎖時，印度就成為我們大後方的門戶。所以不論平時戰時，中印兩國彼此都有密切關係。所可惜的，爲了種種妨碍，種種不方便，到如今，中國既不能深切了解印度，印度也無從明瞭現在的中國。戰爭終了了以後，中印間在戰時的交通，立即停止，更使我們減少了對於印度問題的注意，實在太不應該！</p>
<p>由目前看，印度的獨立運動，似乎一時尚難達到完美的成功。現在英國執政的是自稱信守社會主義的工黨。工黨自從去秋上台以來，在印度問題上它的面目與保守黨政府也找不出多大的分別。尼赫魯等許多印度的獨立運動領袖從去年出獄以來，屢次聲明，印度民族所祈求者，是獨立而不是自治，是要完全脫離大英帝國的統治，不願在大英帝國中，成為許多自治領的一環。可是英國工黨政府，依然傳授着保守黨的衣缽，祗許印度可以享受自治領式的自由，無論派什麽人什麽團到印度去談判，講來講去，依然沒有溢出一九四二年克裡浦斯爵士代表英政府所提出的範圍。英國政府對於印度的過分重視，不容諱言的，使印度的獨立，不能如菲律賓那樣的簡單容易，而英國報紙却還說菲律賓的獨立尚不及英國的自治領。</p>
<p>其次印度的內部，顯然現在分裂得相當厲害。印度歷年來的獨立運動，大都由國民大會黨領導。不料「既生瑜，何生亮，」主張印國分治的真納起來，處處和甘地尼赫魯成相持之局，一正一負力量相消的結果，把印度民族的爭取獨立運動，大為減色。而正在英內閣訪印團乍返英倫之際，又有所謂賤民團體，繼起興國民大會黨為難。印度雖然是一個國家，然而在種族，宗教，語言，階級，和習慣等等方面，却久已給人家在暗中劃成片片，使骨肉相殘，兄弟　墻，同在一家之中，偏爲他人造起高深的壁壘。於是印度的人為的不能團結，就成為印度獨立前途的一個很大的打擊。一個主權受人侵害的國家，往往也是自己難以團結的國家。所以從路透電多次宣傳出印度賤民團體反對國民大會黨的消息來看，階示出印度的獨立運動勢必還須付出相當的代價。</p>
<p>然而，自由和獨立，印度四萬萬民族，遲早終會到手的。第一，印度民族有高深潛哲的文化，這個文化已使每一個印度人，對於自己國家的必須獲得自由和獨立，全部蘇醒過來。只要印度民族自己覺得迫切需要，必然會達到目的。第二，在獨立運動中，印度的領袖人才，比亞洲其他被壓迫的國家，如緬甸·馬來亞·荷蘭東印度等，要強得多，也多得多。緬甸到今天，還找不出一個對內能領導全國，對外有國際地位的領袖；而印度則除甘地·尼赫魯·阿然特·潘迪夫人以外，更不知有多少。印度有這樣偉大的領袖，正如中國在推翻滿清的時候，又國父領導，消減軍閥和抵抗日寇的時候，有主席領導一般，豪沒有問題，使印度的獨立，遲早一定可以成功的。第三，印度的獨立運動，任何國家，現在莫不寄以深切的期望和同情。從美國起，以至中國蘇聯和其他國家，都已有明顯的表示，殷望印度的四萬萬民族能早日脫去桎梏，共同為這多難的世界，肩荷起建築和平的大道。第四，就以英國論，印度民族對英國，已盡了久長的巨大的貢獻，特別在第一次和這次大戰時，印度民族已流了很多的血，英內閣訪印團於本月十八日向上下議院，分別報告和印度領袖談判經過時，表示英國確有誠意使印度早日成為一獨立自主之國家。這種態度原是很正當的，希望英國就不必再提什麽附帶條件，像美國對菲律賓一樣，從遠東實現其諾言。總結以上四點來看，我們覺得印度的獨立前途，已顯現將有強烈的光明。</p>
<p>印度獨立，一旦完成，世界和平的大局，可以說築成了一半，因為在亞非兩洲的奴隸民族，沒有獲得自由和解放以前，世界的一切和平和安全都是空的，都無異建築在沙土上的。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕外交部今日宣稱英國已向埃及提出照會，推辭甚為強硬，抗議英國兵士繼續受人攻擊。英政府雖和此種敵對行動，乃希望兩國關係惡化者所指使，但對於埃及政府如何應付此種不可容忍之情形，亦頗關切。英國方面認為埃及政府並未採取其應取及能取之方法，以保障英國軍人生命。前耶路撒冷　赦長赫賽尼自法國逃出後，即托庇埃及王宇下，現在亞歷山大里亞，埃及政府對於其政治活動，並未保證防範，英國亦表示憂慮。英駐埃大使康培爾與埃及政府之談話尚未竣事，赫賽尼若長此居留埃及，則情形殊難滿意。據外交部非正式表示，無論埃及作何保證，倫敦方面不信赫賽尼將與英國合作。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中華基督敎靑年會全國協會主席黎照寰博士，於本年二月底，與該會總幹事梁小初氏，聯袂飛往瑞士，代表該會參加全世界靑年會代表大會，會後又途經英倫，赴美參加北美青年會大會，足跡遍歷歐美各國，最近翩然歸來，本報記者特趨其寓邸訪問，叩以此行觀感。</p>
<p>黎氏稱：此行觀感最深刻者，莫過於英國之奮鬥精神，據吿：自英皇以下，莫不均肯犧牲，戰爭雖已結束多時，惟因國內一切仍未復原，故人民仍過戰時生活，一如戰事仍未終了。戰時所施行之各項統制，現亦繼續存在，故英國亦無黑巿。</p>
<p>黎照寰氏近影（顧廷鵬攝）</p>
<p>此次戰後</p>
<p>英人深覺世界潮流業已轉變。故國家施政，外交方針，均有調整。例如以前之所謂帝國主義意味，在英之許多舊友，認爲已成過去。現在英國係勞工政府當政，如無意外波折，現時之政府，可望繼續執政至一九五〇年。</p>
<p>談至此，黎氏乃引證近世社會學所推行之兩大學派：一係環境學派，一係遺傳學派。由此行觀感所及，深覺舉世潮流，均有傾向環境學派之趨勢。例如此行足跡所歷之英瑞美各國，均已放棄以前之傳統政策，而各項施策，莫不以適應環境爲着眼點。</p>

<h3 id="c66">中華水產公司　開辦鐵路冷藏業務 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大熱天裏，趕着參觀農林部中華水產公司開辦鐵路冷藏業務，意味顯得新鮮！題材也够當令。</p>
<p>據中華水產公司說：他們這次開辦鐵路冷藏業務，爲的是解除糧食恐慌，抑平水產品及農產品的市價，所以向交通部津浦路局程到了四輛冷藏火車，預備往返行駛京滬·滬杭·津浦各路，專運各種冷凍魚類，鮮肉蛋類，及農產有關的水菓蔬菜等食品。</p>
<p>前天下午四時五十分，從北站開南京的四等列車中，就掛了一節第一次出動的冷藏車。記者趕到北站時，那節整裝待發的冷藏車，剛由機車頭拖着其他的列車，把它啣接起來。</p>
<p>冷藏車的外廓，跟普通的鐵蓬車，並無二致。只不過它給漆上了一層淡灰色，比起醜陋的鐵蓬車來，已覺較勝一籌了。這次處女航，裝的是水產公司裏的一批黄魚。所以車門開處，迎面雖送來了一陣陰涼，却充溢着魚腥臭！</p>
<p>車廂的內部，四壁都舖着厚達八吋的羊毛毡，用以與外界的暖氣隔絕。車項全部裝就了隔層的冰糟，安置了三噸多的冰塊。車廂裏留下來的空間雖不十分大，據說也可裝十來噸鮮貨。</p>
<p>試辦時期，每天只限京滬路對開一次，每次掛一節，而且裝貨也只以上海與南京間直放爲限好沿途小站，暫不接貨。辦理得，，逐步推廣到其他各路和各小站上去，終希望達到普遍服務爲目的。</p>
<p>目前中華水產公司對津浦路局所負担的車租，是每天每噸九百六十元。而每節車的載重是十二噸，所以每天每節車車租的支出，要一萬一千五百二十元。而客家有鮮貨要裝，每噸只須照原來路局規定的運費，加百分之三十，那末你的鮮貨，雖僕僕火熱而漫長的京滬道上，也能經常保持着它的鮮度。</p>
<p>臨去北站時，　地在這列四等客車的末尾，發現了一節列車，裝載了二輛橡皮輪的美軍冷藏拖車。有一位冷藏業裏的人士，不自覺地指點着說：這才是眞正標準的冷藏車了，因爲它是用阿母尼亞壓縮而產生冷氣的。我們的冷藏車又未免相形見細了。可是記者却認爲未然。目前在物質上，我們雖追不上人家的新穎。可是，這一些把握現實，迎頭趕上的精神，終該爭取。中華水產公司這次開辦鐵路冷藏業務，至少已表現了這精神的一部份。記者相信在不久的將來，眞正的冷藏車，在這種精神不斷的揮發下，就將馳騁於所有中國的鐵道上！</p>

<p>在美蘇各國，對於入學前（Rre．Shool）一段敎育與保健，即嬰兒呱呱墮地至幼稚園入學止，是由國家普設慈幼保健院，担起敎養衛療的工作。在我國呢？各地也不乏慈幼組織，如育嬰堂，敎養院等，但可惜大都是設備簡陋，房屋破舊，種種環境，均不適合嬰兒的生活與衛生，送進去的嬰兒，祇聽其自然的生長，無力顧及嬰兒的健康，事實上不能好好負起保健的責任·所以一個薪水階級的公敎人員與職業婦女，要想解決孩子的托養與健康問題，簡直是無法處置。在這種情形之下，每年不知犧牲了多少嬰兒。就是熱誠爲兒童造福，想解決這種困難的婦女們，但爲了經濟的關係，誰也沒有勇氣來苦幹。</p>
<p>日前記者在偶然的機會中，到四川北路東寶興路一七三弄十號上海市幼兒康保健院裏去參觀。是一座新近粉刷裝修的三層新穎洋房裘，當記者跑進去的時候，恰巧有一個寄養的孩子入院，兩個穿白色制服的小姐，正在檢騐睡在白色長方檯上的孩子，一個是拿聽診器的女醫師，一個是女看護。坐在四人寫字合上的梁小姐，見了我很和藹地來招呼，記者連忙取出一張名片，說明了來意。在梁小姐股勤的引導之下，記者上樓與該院院長惲伯琴小姐作初次的見面，惲院長是一個和藹可親的女性，從她文雅的舉止大方的態度看來，確是一位善於辦事的巾幗翹楚。</p>
<p>惲院長見到了我這位「不速之客」，使很撳虛的說：「我們這種地方，實在不能辦理寄養孩子的事情！所以現在積極在請求分配房屋。」接着記者便向她詢問關於該院創辦的動機。</p>
<p>「本人創辦保健院的動機，也是爲了自己本來是個職業婦女，爲了服務社會，專心　忠於職務，爲能照顧到孩子，把自己的孩子丟在沒有醫學常識的傭人手裏，我的大孩子是一個奶媽帶的，俗語說：「吃奶像三分」，我大孩子的脾氣就像奶媽，種種壞習慣，到了今年七歲了，還是矯正不過來」。</p>
<p>「第二個孩子，我決心自己哺乳，但爲了乳汁不多，小孩子太瘦了，不得已後來仍僱用奶媽，年輕的奶媽，她更不聽我的話，偷偷的讓孩子多吃不消化的東西，天氣又熱，就在發覺不及救治的赤痢病中，喪了她一條性命」。</p>
<p>「今年的正月，爲了自己的工作忙，第四個孩子也在傭人們和公立醫院醫師誤投藥石而又夭折了。」她很悲憤地說。</p>
<p>「我想像這樣的遭遇，非僅孩子的不幸，也是國家的不幸，尤其是一個職業婦女和公教人員的子女，痛苦更深，一面爲了補助家用，不得不帮助丈夫找一個職業，一面又捨不得把孩子丟在家裏無人照料，或不放心交給傭人領帶。同時更沒有一個相當的寄托地方，因此我下了店家個決心。但是辦理一件事，不是容易的，這些孩子好容易長大，全賴這班兒童護士和熱誠的兩位醫師，不分日夜的輪值護理。」她一面說，一面向值班護士拿了一件白色消毒的隔離衣，和口罩，請我穿上，她自已也回到房裏去換上隔離衣及口罩，才招呼記者進入第一保健室去參觀。</p>
<p>全室是舖滿奶油色新型活用的小木床，每床睡着一個嬰兒，四床一組，每組有一個穿白衣的兒童護士小姐護理着，換尿布，喂乳，她們好像母親一樣體貼入微爲孩子辛勞，但每個年較護士小姐，沒有一個不溫柔活潑的，記者下意識的想起自己的幼年，不禁傷感，一個無母親的孩子，如果當時也有保健院，決不會遭受冷酷無知的傭婦欺凌·使自己至今沒有獲得正常的身心發展，以致影響健康。</p>
<p>當記者退出保健室後，再詢間惲院長關於今後之計劃，承其詳吿如次：</p>
<p>「本院現在尙屬初辦時期，唯一的工作即是先奠定基礎。」一面向有關當局申請配給房屋，總之這是一件社會事業，並非屬於個人私有的，但希望社會各界的人士予以同情與援助。」</p>
<p>記者看了看時間已不早了，就吿辭退出，除了對惲院長能够因自已感到痛苦就替大家解決的服務精神深感欽佩外，同時更默頌幼兒康保健院的永生，這眞是上海母親之幸，嬰兒之福。</p>

<p>— 本報五日揚州訊　特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>在江浙兩省裏湖之可供遊覽者，第一當推有着「三潭印月」名勝的「山外青山樓外樓」的西子湖，其次則為以壯觀的石頭城和巍峨的鐘山底環抱與烘托，以及有芙　的滿盛而成其格局的玄武湖；再其次，則該是以瘦字爲其特點的揚州瘦西湖了。</p>
<p>詩的古跡</p>
<p>若是扯開去說：本來，揚州的繁華是歷朝所著名的，有過一個時候，它較「金陵六朝」的繁盛也許亦有過之無不及哩。這從建治上多少能考查得出：揚州本九州之一，周漢時代，現今的江蘇·安徽·江西·浙江·福建等地，是皆置屬揚州的。即清代光緒年間，揚州猶統轄江·甘·儀·高·寶·泰·東等八個縣。而繁華的舊蹟，清李艾塘在所著之「揚州書紡錄」中叙載，相當詳細，謂「揚商以應致富，幾家家有園亭池館之勝，高宗南巡時，復多增飾又有山人墨客書畫技巧之士潤飾點綴，遂極一時之盛」。那末，在前代人的詩藻裏，無怪乎要有「腰纏十萬貫，跨鶴上揚州」。「天上三分明月夜，二分無賴是揚州」等誇耀揚州讚美揚州的辭句了。而又有單形容揚州花草之盛者，唐李白有「烟花三月下揚州」之詩句，清鄭樊有「十里栽花算種田」詩句，而今日瘦西湖上的風光，更證之唐杜收「二十四橋明月夜，玉人何處教吹簫？」二語，可以想見：僅不過是昔日盛景的一部份的遺跡而已。</p>
<p>北國閨秀</p>
<p>今日的瘦西湖上的風光究竟如何呢？記者以為瘦西湖是優美的，嫺靜的，而且帶有三分俏的氣息－像一個服飾典雅體態聘婷的北國閨秀。</p>
<p>雖然，經過入戰爭的影響，此生長于淮南古廣陵的「北國閨秀」，她的面龐已不無憔悴了；許多處在顯現着衰敗和荒圯，但這是指某些人工的建築物說的，至于那天然的湖上風景，像「大虹橋畔」；像「萬松疊翠」；像永遠是　麗的碧澄澄的湖水；像－却依舊是值得遊人流連的。</p>
<p>白塔遠景　瘦西湖名勝之一　王公瀚攝</p>
<p>湖在此間縣城北郊，湖面蜿蜒達五里長，中多曲徑，而寬狹不一，最闊處則有一里許。即因為是多曲徑的，扁舟蕩漾其間，每使遊人覺有「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一邨」之奇。湖上名勝去處計有綠楊邨，小金山，徐園，五亭橋，蓮性寺，熊園，（革命先烈能承基紀念陵園）長隄，廿四橋舊蹟，以及湖之盡頭內有天下第五泉及歐陽修　書處等勝蹟之平山堂等。</p>
<p>書舫小游</p>
<p>今日下午是連期陰雨乍晴的天氣，記者因為與「北國閨秀」闊別已有多年了，遂趁與地作了一次慰藉自己也是慰藉她的遊覽。老北門因為時局的關係是關閉着的，我們乃出的天寗門門，于「下街」香影廊茶社品茗，這處在十分雅致；屋址傍水，　欄外，綠柳婆娑成陰。在這婆娑綠柳的迎面，古城郭遮蓋着半個藍天。東首天寗寺的黃墻，及那充滿着古典味的牌樓，與遊舫碼頭又與這邊的景色相映照，甚以人起詩情畫意的感喟。</p>
<p>遊舫入湖，由香影廊起程至五亭橋來回，講妥價僅一千五百元。坐上去了，有賣糖果瓜子花生米小販踩上船頭來攬生意買了他一千文。</p>
<p>遊舫經「問月橋」過綠楊村，我幾已不認識這一曟昔是多麼美好的村落，蓋曟昔村中茂盛的樹還及幽　看去尚存已無幾。船夫說都是在戰亂的過程裏遭人砍伐掉了。</p>
<p>遊舫接近「曲園」，這裏蔚藍色澤的長空，將一排高聳的蒼松，剪影似的黏在了艷麗的天際。遠遠地看別人回歸的遊舫在排列的蒼松下緩緩的馳來，耳畔裏又奏着船頭激起的潺潺的樂曲，船去無語，天地無語。</p>
<p>但是，遊舫穿過大虹橋，一件事大使我感到悵惘了。湖的西岸，昔日能令我入醉的長隄上的垂柳，竟一顆也不見了。隄之半腰的那四角方亭雖仍存在，我總覺得是挽救不了既成的缺陷的。隄之南岸，熊園的建築又遠遠的便能看出了破敗呵！</p>
<p>放棹中流</p>
<p>抵小金山，（山在湖之中流）上資略遊覽看一週，「湖上草堂」等建築似乎曾已修葺過，得維持住風光不少。繼登山頂上「風亭」，極目四眺，湖光山色，盡收眼底。五亭橋和白塔，與「風亭」係畸角坐勢的，烟樹簇擁在前後左右，風吹樹動，偶然，風又送上來山下海人的笑語。我與我的朋友都在自能感覺着自己的臉龐上顯現了心底的愉快！</p>
<p>五亭橋　瘦西湖名勝之二　本報資料室</p>
<p>小金山頂之風亭　瘦西湖名勝之三　本報資料室</p>
<p>由「風亭」搶石級下來，至約魚台復登遊舫，我們未再到對岸的徐園及蓮性寺裏遊覽去。我們令船夫將遊舫撑至五亭橋孔內停歇。（按：此橋五亭形勢合砌一處取勝橋下四周共有十三個洞孔。）陣陣颶風在橋孔內流貫，我們臥着，一面不覺撩起天來。船夫插嘴，對我們則話起滄桑；說戰後比戰前，他們的生涯從「好」即至「不好，」真有天壤之別，每天，做的最好時，比戰前也只是一與五之比。即戰前瘦西湖上共有遊舫百數千艘，如今祗三四十艘。又提說戰前的船　風頭是如何如何盛，而今亦是不堪回首了。</p>
<p>聽着船夫侃侃地話滄桑，目擊着周圍一帶的湖上風景，和湖心中三兩來往的遊舫，我以為瘦西湖確是憔悴了。</p>
<h3 id="c117">一片焦土看樺甸 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 長春十五日航訊　關榮欽</p>
<p>吉林是山地，到來之後，視野給此連彼接的峯密擠得狹隘多了。在松花江畔呆了好幾天之後，我就想着到別的地方－給峯密阻隔着的地方去看看；可是一直沒有機會。在永吉看到龍天武將軍，他說要到永吉以南的幾個縣份去看駐軍並撫慰民衆，我就要求和他一道去。他答應了。隨龍將軍一同去的，除了我之外，還有吉林日報的于君以及該軍許。趙二營長和參謀楊德廣等八九人。</p>
<p>七月一日清早，我們從永吉南部一個小鎮沿公路出發。約摸走了四十分鐘，到官馬山屯。車子驚地停了下來。當地駐軍將領王師長，請我們吃過「廣東粥」之後，龍將軍就去給隊伍訓話，並接見當地父老士紳。在東北的大都要城如遼陽，潘陽長春等地，我還得看到多幾張笑臉，在官馬山屯可就難得看見了。八九位老者，向龍將軍表示過謝意並致敬之後，就吐出成團成串的痛苦的情緒來。他們說，八路居留之日，對待他們還好，可是走的時候，糧食却全部帶去，八口之家，才留一斗。沒法張羅，好些村民就只得以豆餅充飢。常有豆餅吃的　馬，現在顯得消瘦多了。小學校這裏是有一所，可是經費無着，飢餓把教師鞭得星散了，沒有走的一二位，除了給學生上課之外，還兼做校役的工作。人人的目光都集中在生活的應付上，對未來的主人翁之教育問題，自然分神較少。誰有資格去怨尤他們呢！國軍進駐之後，地方安定下來了，可是在一些遠僻的鄉間，還有過散匪去「借」糧，村民雖無糧可借，可是也不堪其擾。「國軍不會開走吧」？他們生怕國軍一旦會開走，就有什麽厄運就跟蹤而來似的，龍將軍給他們的答覆是「國軍收復一處地方，就不輕易放棄」。</p>
<p>官馬山屯，屬永吉縣，是永吉城南的一個要衛。周圍山峯和高地，都有國軍新近築成的　堡，或方或圓。和父老談完話，龍將軍就去看兩處高地的　堡，看完，吃過午飯，就繼續　東南奔。目的地是百多里外的橫道河子。</p>
<h3 id="c118">向國軍　下跪的同胞 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>百多里的途程，要是路好，兩點鐘就可跑完了。可是到橫道河子的路這麼壞，尤其末一段，修好才數天。一起一伏，石子多，路甚狹，稱雄過印緬原始森林的「小鐵島」也發出野鶴汽車同樣的怪聲，足足爬了四五點鐘才算爬完。</p>
<p>橫道河子是樺甸縣的一個鎮，也是羣山中的一塊小平原。一條大街，（也許說是大路還較恰當）兩旁站着百來幢房子，十之七八是泥建的住宅。這個小鎮，六月中旬才有國軍出現。這一次是過路。民衆看到國軍，就狂歡得人人跳起來。硬把健兒們攔住，要賞光他們携來的慰勞茶水和食物。爲着軍事上的要求，健兒們婉言謝絕，他們就抹掉那歡騰騰的笑臉，全都向國軍下跪，邊哭邊末，到國軍用了他們的一些東西時，才讓國軍走。</p>
<p>這裏的百姓都要求龍將軍給他們講話，可是沒有一個比較寬敞的場所，二丈寬的「馬路」又泥濘滿地，站也站不住，沒法，只得在一幢房子裏開「座談會」，參加的士紳鎮民約摸有三十人。首先由龍將軍說明此行目的，是在看看部隊和防務，並代表蔣主席慰問同胞。接着父老們就吐露過去十四年的　　和國軍進駐前八個月的疼痛。坐在我身旁的老者告訴我，過去八個月所受的痛苦，比過去十四年所受的還深。這裏的韓僑為數不少。偽滿時代，他們　閉彷團，種水田，吃大米，生活雖然比不上日本人那麼舒服，可是比「滿」人寫意多多。光復後，他們的土地沒法不交還原來的主人－東北同胞了，這麼一來，生活自成問題。又加以八路的宣傳（如朝鮮北部是如何如何的一個自由快樂的天地之類）年輕的韓僑，就多參加八路。有些自願，有些則是被迫的。當地同胞稱他們爲「朝鮮八路」也許稱「韓共」來得較適當。他們當與八路協同一致行動，還以種種非法作風加諸當地同胞身上。八路退到五十里外的松花江東岸，數百「韓共」都跟着走了。沒有走的韓僑，鎮民也希望當局早日給他們遣送返國。我早就知道吉林韓僑多，可是聽到先祖他們的話，還是我到此地後的第一次。</p>
<h3 id="c119">樺甸　焦黑！ <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 慘白！</p>
<p>二日晨，龍將軍給部隊講過話，又看過工事之後，我們就到樺甸縣城去了。　子走的大多是本來走叛軍（這里叫「大軍」）的大路。顛簸的很。拖了三點多鐘，總算拖到了。</p>
<p>樺甸縣城有點像衡陽。六七千幢房子，給燒去五千幢，東南區本來是精華所在，現在却是焦土一片，只剩下一座朝鮮教堂，孤獨地站在焦黑的瓦礫　中，份外顯得慘白。災民一萬多，登記的就有九千七。當地商民組織的救濟會，在代理縣長鄧世松氏協助下展開急賑。每一災民分到二十斤米，差不多要裸露着身體的還拿到一一點布料。十多天後的米糧如何打算呢？誰也不知道。目前還是夏天，兩個月後，要下雪了，他們都知道這是個嚴重問題，也爲這嚴重的問題心驚肉跳。「特別可憐，特別救濟我們樺甸人民吧」！一羣無家可居的父老這樣哀求龍將軍。龍將軍答應給他們轉達省方，並告訴鄧縣長說：「要是經費成問題，可晳在軍部墊一部」。</p>
<p>樺甸同胞將永遠不會忘記為虎作倀的不肖韓僑首先進駐樺甸的青年軍，兵力不多，韓僑就把情報供給本來已退到數十里外的八路，八路就即時集結七八千人園攻樺甸。衆寡懸殊，苦戰之後，守城的青年軍就被迫北撤，死傷百餘，被俘百餘，龍將軍轄下的劉梓學將軍部趕到之後，八路才又退回松花江東岸去。八路撤退前數天，樺甸城起火了。放火的有八路，更多的是韓僑。誰要是想撲滅火焰，</p>
<p>或搬出一件衣物，誰就要被槍殺。野火似地，一燒就是八天。國軍和臨時縣府工作人員進城之後，才把餘焰撲熄。難民們告訴記者：火頭那末多，火焰那麼烈，要是國軍遲來三小時，樺甸城恐怕盡成灰燼了！</p>
<p>建築材料，除了木材之外，樺甸可說樣樣缺。有錢也買不到，何況沒有錢！災民希望政府設立銀行，繁榮市面，並貸點款走出死路。本來，樺甸是個富縣，中部紅絲砬子，老金廠等地，有的是金，石油，煤和銅等鑛產，金鑛區大多在與國軍有聯系的地下軍手裏，銅，煤等鑛區，則仍在八路佔領下。要是電力恢復，金鑛可每天出金五斤至十斤，有些父老建議，如政府救濟費成問題，可設法以「金鑛」充救濟費。龍將軍希望樺甸同胞充實自衛力量，實行連保，連坐連防，支持地方政府從事救濟和建設工作，幷協助地方駐軍，使一片焦土的樺甸能夠在安全的氣氛中更生過來。</p>

<h3 id="c122">揚州人所不忘的戰士有了下落　董明德氏青雲直上　離揚後留美深造現任空軍副司令 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：閱七月四日，貴報社會服務欄，悉有劉中和君訪尋董中校明德的近況，本人與董中校頗為稔熟，且服務空軍有年，茲將其近況略述如下：董中校現任空軍第三路副司令，我國空軍階級，晋升不易，中校階級的空軍人員，並不衆多，故自其現階之職位之重要而觀，可見董中校在抗戰中的功績，以及學識能力的卓異。董中校自離別揚州以後，一直在祖國的大空上，給敵人以無情的打擊，在保衛大武漢時，他已　升爲全國聞名的志抗大隊大隊長，他率領着他英武的勇士，展開他們的銀　，掩衛着祖國，他們擊落敵機，掃蕩敵人，但不久他們又馳騁在天空裏給敵人更無情的打擊，飛機不好，器材沒有補給，然而只要有一架能夠起飛的飛機，他們見了敵人，不管多少，就紅着眼，拼了！董中校直到現在還是保持着擊落敵機很多的記錄。董中校離揚後到過武漢，梁山，蘭州，重慶，成都，每天每刻是戰鬥，戰鬥，戰鬥！</p>
<p>他受了傷，但他又飛馳着了。有一個時期，他去担任訓練的工作，他到了成都，訓練着一批一批的空軍學生，另一方面同時又訓練着已學成的學生們，怎樣來戰鬥？這時我們的空軍學生，到了不能不送到國外去學習的時候，他奉命率領了大批學生去美國受訓，到美以後，他的才識和　　，使和他接觸過的美國人驚訝而欽佩，都翹起大拇指說「你頂好！」</p>
<p>在美國蔚藍的晴空中，中國空軍學生緊張的受着訓練，一批一批的學成歸國，參加抗戰，董中校所領隊的這批學生，經過一個長期的訓練，也應該歸國了，這時政府正向美國訂購了一批B-25中型轟炸機，正要飛華參戰，董中校就奉命駕駛了一架B-25機，飛返祖國，他們在美國曼斐斯地方出發，經過加拿大，格陵蘭，冰島，蘇格蘭，北愛爾蘭，英格蘭，摩洛哥，突尼西亞，的黎波里，班加西，開羅，伊拉克，伊蘭，到印度喀拉齊，然後再回到祖國，全程萬餘英里，飛行時間共五十餘小時，但因天氣以及其他種種關係，旅程共費去約四十天，有些他所經過的地方，如加拿大北部，格陵蘭，冰島等處，從未有中國人去過，不要說是中國人的空軍人員了，這些地方的人，雖然知道有中國這麼兩個字，可是都是模糊得很，經董中校一行經過之後，他們對中國的認識，較為具體了，知道中國也正與美英國人一樣地駕駛着最新式的飛機在打擊着侵略鄰國和影響對於中國更為重大，故較橫渡大西洋或太平洋實在更值得欽佩。</p>
<p>從美國回來後，他在航空委員會担任重要幕僚工作，其後，進了空軍最高學府參謀學校，畢業以後，就担任現職迄今。</p>
<p>這是一段董中校離揚後的梗概，他在這許多年的努力和功績，想來不致叫揖念他的揚州同胞如劉君者失望吧！最後，董中校已拜讀了劉君的這篇通訊了，他非常感激揚州同胞和劉君的一番盛意，幷囑本人一幷在此致謝，他的通訊處：是重慶空軍第三路司令部。專此即祝撰安，讀者方　上，七，十五，於重慶</p>

<h3 id="c124">敦煌的藝術 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 吳作人</p>
<p>兩千餘年以前有兩流文化在東西兩方平行而各異有趣的輝煌着：一個就是中國文化，另一個就是希臘文化。這兩個文化因為東西交流的阻隔，無從會合而相交流。雖有亞歷山大的雄心，終佇足於喜馬拉雅山之南麓，哭途窮面回師（時在周顯王四十三年）。直待四五百年以後，印度佛教行於中國，始由已受希臘影響的佛教藝術間接帶來了希臘文化。敦煌藝術是我們在今天所能看到的這兩種文化結合最顯著的作品。</p>
<p>在漢唐盛世，敦煌是重要的東西交通點。但自明室憚吐蕃的侵擾，閉疆界於嘉峪關，委敦煌於異域。清康雍間雖復便蕃，然陽關古道則不再爲商旅所取。盛極一時的敦煌莫高窟也就漸爲沙拖，漸爲人所遺忘了。緣是最近幾年的事，我們又重新注意到敦煌莫高窟。這並非宗教情緒的恢復，而是藝術上的欣賞與探討。</p>
<p>東西文化的互相影響，是件無庸諱言的事。中外的學者，專家早已在追尋其踪跡了。敦煌藝術並不是一家或一代的作品，而是無數的善男信女的捐貢與藝，無數的藝術家與工人的匠心經營，歷南北朝以迄元季，八百餘載的光陰。自明以降雖屢遭毀弄，廟貌蕩然，塑像已摧。猶存有壁畫之洞，至今尚計三百零九，可以算世界僅存的中國古畫院了。</p>
<p>敦煌藝術固然受了嚴重的損傷：塑像已毀，壁畫之免於天然或人為的製造者，亦多色彩變褪，剝落不完。但我們依然還可以看得出各個時代不同的風格，以至各代衣冠及其生活形式。壁畫除了中間部分所畫的那些淨土變相等等帶有印度作風外，邊幅所繪經典中故事的插畫與供養人繪像，其人，物，殿宇，服裝，風俗，悉依當時體制。有很多裝束及生活形式在現在的我們認為新式的，歐化的，然莫高窟壁畫告訴我們在千餘年前的中國已經有過的了。我們站在這許多壁畫前面，得着多少意外的啟示，我們不能不驚訝。有好些洞窟內的壁畫，我們假如有時間可在一個洞子裏看一整天，還可有層出不窮的發見。</p>
<p>就作風來說，南北朝獷放騰動，龍飛駒奔，有挾雷霆，御風雲之勢。圖多爲平面簡彩，（一九一洞之天花板）。間亦有用線條鈎勒，然沒色運筆，氣韻雜拔，非必拘於線形；亦不若現代歐洲新派作風益形之不存者。（一四三等洞之「護法」）至若線條之強勁活潑，人物體態之輕盈生動，實非後人所敢輕試（一四三洞之菩提，二四〇洞「釋迦苦行」中之麗女）。</p>
<p>唐風則一反前期奔，漸整筋衣冠，登雍容華貴之境。要求形體的修短合度，設色的富麗。背景亦由簡而繁。有樓殿巍峨，有亭榭台閣，無不着意於精巧透視。當然，在這種景色中，人物表現亦必盡力集人類所能有的美點於一身。所以唐代菩提多豐乳纖腰，長眉秀目。唇潤頤腴，膊廣掌柔。頂東高髻，項垂長髪。我們固視之為印度作風。但所以造成這種作風的觀會，莫非源於希臘藝術晚期的「希臘風」（Helenistique）。乃至舞人樂工無不美足以飾淨土的極樂。由這兩種表現的轉變，在作風上可以比擬於希臘藝術的自由拙期轉入全盛期。在思想上可以比擬於基督教藝術由中古世紀作風轉入文藝復興期。中國藝術能有一個唐代的高潮，高潮絕非可一躍而登極峯，必先有南北朝以至隨的雄強粗　，如生命之朝氣，力所及，與所發，雖宇宙至大似猶不足以包涵。迨五代異族侵凌，回　且陷沙洲。宋光故土，在藝術上續前朝餘緒，乃藝運之已由頂點而下降，故終宋世未有所新創。然際西夏據沙洲時，所繪洞，在洞口兩面壁畫今爲積沙所蝕，殘缺大半。猶於頂端可見「黃道十二宮」之符號（Les　Signes　de　Zodiaque）。蓋「黃道十二宮」源於巴比倫而希臘附之以神話，中國神話尚未聞有此傳說，而以之入畫，更屬解見。</p>
<p>喇嘛洞窟，其規模較大者，僅見其一（三〇九洞）乃元時所鑒。洞之中央，原有巨塑，爲伐喇祭喇與煞娣抱合之像，不幸已於十餘年前全毀。今尚可在敗堆中偶獲墮指殘掌，斷片猶見織巧。其壁畫題材與塑像相似，得免遭厄運。其風格已屬藏畫系統，蓋爲透過尼泊爾藝術而獲得印度阿張達壁畫的影響。</p>
<p>塑像如三〇九洞全毀者外，其餘各洞中即存，亦無完整。雖項斷肢裂，僅存軀幹（二七三，二七四，二七五等洞），終不能晦其神工。尤可驚服者，闕爲隨唐　塑家對於解剖學之認識，對於比例動態之標準。其觀察之精微，表現之純淨，實可與其前千年之Phidias及Praxitele等聖手，與其後千年之Donatello及Michel　Angello　輩巨匠在世界人類的智慧上共放異彩。不惟塑造，同期之畫亦然。一三二洞神帳上「蓮花童子」，雖因年久色黑，然其運筆暢而不亂。按其動態修短，肌肉豐肥起伏，無不適孩童之神態形狀，實敦煌藝術傑作中之傑作。</p>
<p>至於裝飾圖案，尤富於變化。每個洞窟頂上的藻井圖案，都各具意匠。而其取材無論其為植物，動物或風帶，祥雲，莫不有出人意表的結構。</p>

<h3 id="c125">關於洋畫的學習 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 劉師</p>
<p>寫給愛好「洋畫」的朋友和解答初學者的疑問</p>
<p>學習所謂「西洋畫」，必須從寫生入手，「寫生」又必須自素描開始，這就是與學習傳統的國畫所不同的地方。「素描」又分兩種：一種是作為學畫基礎的素描，一種純粹獨立性而含有趣味的素描的素描。前者爲學習時期必須操練且絕不能苟且為之的，可稱之爲學習的素描。換言之，素描基礎之優劣，就可決定其未來之成功與失敗。後者是與複興華麗的彩色畫具有同等價值，且另具一種清雅之風，可以儘情儘性的向趣味方面發展的，又可稱之為作家的素描。</p>
<p>研究「洋畫」，必經的階段是畫石膏模型。其理由是有三：一，石膏模型是不動的形體，可以聽憑初學者從容的描寫。二，色白，輪廓清晰，綫條明確。到，質與色均簡單，易於分辨。三你能把對象（石膏模型）整個的安置在一張紙面上，使其不感到侷促和多於空白浪費紙張的時候，那就是入了門徑面可以進一步的向動的對象繼續探求了。所謂動的對象，小如虫魚，大至人物，風景，凡大自然間一切物象，都可以取之入畫，祗要你的能力夠，基礎好。</p>
<p>素描的材料很多，木炭，鉛筆，鋼筆，甚至於毛筆都可製作精美的繪畫，等你感到單調和淡薄的時候，在素描上加以水色，就是「水彩」，加以油色，便是「油畫」。這就是所謂「洋畫」正統的方法和精神。</p>
<p>關於「水彩」，即如上述：無論水彩和油畫，都須具有穩固的素描根基，而水彩並不如一般所規定的水彩爲初學者的第二階段，油畫爲第三階段。一言以蔽之，水彩與油畫根本各有特點，各有趣味，也各有獨立的價值。水彩的特點是明快，輕鬆，宜於野外寫生和靜物小品。材料簡單，携带方便，中小學作為教材尤為適宜。自古以來，水彩畫無驚人巨製，專以水彩成名成家者亦寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>油畫是「洋畫」中的主要材料，無論中西成功的作家都把它重視爲畫家的主拔，它比其他任何材料來得複雜，使作者能以充分的發揮他的表現慾，適宜製作偉大的作品，且能經久不變。但，初學者往往带着鈍色，畫面易呈現出混亂調子，原因不外乎不諳色性，不知輕重，不懂層次。要解決上述種種困難，須從研究色性入手，再加以失敗而得來的經騐後自然會明瞭一切的。</p>
<p>繪畫，除去基礎穩固外，還要研究怎樣「構圖」？當作者找到美的對象時，首先着急的就是「要怎樣才能把它佈置在畫面中？」那里有的是線與線的配合，明與暗的分布，色與色對照，物與物遠近……正如一個音樂家構思一個交響曲一樣的感到棘手。所以在動筆之先，必須慎重的加以思考，成竹在胸之後，始能爭取預料的效果。並且由構圖的優劣可以判斷作者的畫才的高下。</p>

<p>「砰！」麗華狂怒的拿起一隻茶杯砸過去。然後她扑下去哭了！</p>
<p>張弦沒有再作聲了。可是嫉妬的火並沒有熄，他從此把女學校當作愁恨的對象，他決心要向那「博學多才」的人報復。他在墨太太的面前挑撥是非，他硬誣賴遣劭凌存心不良，常常誘惑麗華到女學校去幽會，又說劉子雲就是替他們「拉皮條」的人。</p>
<p>墨太太對於張弦的話並不相信，她知道麗華是一個規矩的孩子，而且看得出董劭凌也不是一個壞人。但她所詫異的，就是麗華從沒有對一個人自動地願接近過；尤其男人，她一向是畏恐懼討厭的；而獨有這次，麗華竟那樣熱烈的歡迎董劭凌；而且爲了張弦對董劭凌不禮貌，發了那麼大的脾氣。這確是叫她值得揣摩的一點！她想到麗華已經十五歲了，十五歲的女孩子該是懂事的時候，為人麗華的終身幸福；爲了她自己的還未滿足的慾望；她不能不加以防備。因此，她便開始干涉麗華的行動；並禁止麗華常常到女學校去；她的理由是：怕會影響麗華的名譽。即令劉子雲，她也不許麗華和她多接近。這種情形，麗華明白是張弦搞的鬼。在表面上她不反抗，可是暗地她依然常常到女子學校去，常常與劉子雲傾談一切，（她已經不再對劉子雲緘默了。）而且常常和董劭凌見面。她接受着他們兩個人的教育，她在重新學作人，她的性靈不自覺地已經開始有了新的蛻變！</p>

<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>美術大衆化問題，在所謂人民世紀的今日，已經是無可置疑的事，就在於如何可以大衆化的手法問題。</p>
<p>美術大衆化，我認為至少要有下列幾個前提：</p>
<p>一，美術是以大衆爲內容的。</p>
<p>二，美術是屬於大衆的。</p>
<p>三，美術是領導大衆的。</p>
<p>民主思潮之在今日，已如激流之不可遏止，在這樣的洪流之中，現實的大衆生活，正是美術家絕好的內容。固然，大衆生活，有它的光明而與黑暗面，而美術家唯一的任務，光明面應該儘量揭發，而黑暗面則又應該不顧一切的予以暴露，使得大衆能夠獲得更合理，更需要的生活。</p>
<p>勞動者的神聖的雄姿，資本家的榨取與剝削，這些運用美術的形式表現出來，便是屬於大衆的一美術家，又應該更深一層：，像高爾基一樣來下一個預言的「暴風雨！暴風雨快要爆發了！…讓暴風雨來得更厲害些吧」！－「海燕」。盡領導大衆的職責。</p>
<p>這裏我們還不可忽略，在形式上，要揀大衆所熟悉的，比如：繪畫的陰影，不如對稱與綫描製作，這是一個基本條件。</p>
<p>很多的朋友在担心，中國民族藝術將會沒落而至於消減，因之，他們，苦心孤詣地處處想保存。</p>
<p>但是：我先疑惑，中國民族藝術是什麽，毛筆畫可以做代表嗎？可是，很清楚的，毛筆，紙張未發明之前，也應該有民族，更應該有藝術。也可以證明，藝術的發展，是隨着生產技術而發展。徒呼保存，是無用的。</p>
<p>假如，中國一背子在小手工業生產之下過去，毛筆畫，可能毫無問題，原封不動。可是，世界已經不是如此簡單，要在企業國家化條件之下，利用「原子能」來改變現在的生產。因之，中國的民族藝術，一定很自然要改變，它是怎樣的東西？我們雖然很難有肯定得答復，但，至少不是大家想保存的民族藝術的東西。</p>
<p>大概，我們還不至於健忘，「西洋畫」這件寶貝在中國發展歷程是怎樣一回事？</p>
<p>寫實主義美術，可能稱之為現實主義美術。這種作品，是要靠作家切切實實在實際的生活中體騐出來，不容矯揉造作的。</p>
<p>譬如，一個畫家，不曾上過戰場，不曾走進後方的傷兵醫院，偏偏要在亭子間畫室中盡傷兵的大構圖，結果，徒具軀殼，沒有感人的力量，不論色彩，用筆……都覺得一股作氣，盡而上的構成統一的效果沒有，正如中國畫中沒有氣韻，只是刻，板，結，枯，弱，……的感覺而已。</p>
<p>被稱為現實主義的大文豪家高爾基，不論他的「我的大學」，「母親」，「我的童年」……作品，無一不是從實生活中經騐出來的東西，我們的美術家，應該跟他學習。</p>
<p>感覺遲鈍的美術家，還以為現代只需要研究一點筆情墨趣，色彩綫條，從蘋果表現生命，從山水樹石表現清高。可是不容你忽略的，失業，飢餓，掠奪，死亡……這些偉大的場面，擺在你的眼前，爲什麽不肯正視一下，表現一下，也許是不敢吧？</p>
<p>不，美術家門，因為要求純粹藝術的建立，如果內容太接近現實，就不「純粹」了。但，西洋美術史裏，「一八三〇年」，「石工」，「啖爪者」……許多繪畫名作，算它是純粹藝術嗎？</p>
<p>因為生活安定，感覺也就會遲鈍起來，在這些美術家的視野裏，只有蘋果，山水……。</p>
<p>可是，社會是向前發展着的，美術豈能停滯不前呢？</p>
<p>「為藝術而藝術。」是美術家想和現實絕緣的口號。然而，世界沒有一個地方能夠與現實完全脫離的。假使一個人有這樣的想法，便表現自私與吝嗇。</p>
<p>藝術價值與社會價值是一元的，真的藝術，決計少不了社會價值，而正確的社會價值，便依附於優秀的藝術價值而表現出來。只想一味提高藝術價值而看輕社會價值，結果是降低了藝術價值。</p>
<p>所以，「為藝術而藝術」。是要努力於藝術品的社會價值的確定，否則，充及其量，是「爲技術的技術。」</p>
<p>一九四六，六，二十。</p>
<h3 id="c129">鐘壽芝　美術的真義 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>回憶我在學校的時候，看到蔡孑民先生以美育代宗教的一篇文章，當時印象頗深，我現在趨入美術一方面，未始不由於此。十餘年來，經過了這樣驚天動地的大戰，無異把世界翻了一個身；道德的淪喪，宗教的消頹，人心的敗壞，至於極點。社會的賢達人士，雖然苦口嗜昔，大聲疾呼，而不能振惕愚蒙，有所糾正。講到道德，便嗤爲陳腐，講到宗教，便斥爲迷信；長此陷溺下去，一切紀律風化，完全蕩然無存。社會的組織，亦將破壞而無秩序，人民的困苦益深，真將入於萬劫不復的境地了。</p>
<p>我們並非要提倡舊宗教舊道德，不過一個國家的存立，一個社會的組織，那能沒有中心思想以為維緊人心的目標？現代社會的所以混亂，就因為沒有衡量人類行為的準繩。所以我們必須要在時代的洪流中，開辟出一條平坦的大道，為人人所宜遵循，以爲維緊社會的一種原動力，這就是所謂新道德，而建築這新道德的路基，就是美育。爲什麽呢？因為美與善是相連的，善是道德而美則是善的根基；有了美的根基，就有善的行為。現在社會的種種醜惡表演，就是不美，也就是不善。假如他們知道愛美，就必憎厭這種醜惡的行為，也就不致不善了。所以我們以為一切教育應以美育爲目標，以陶冶一班學子，養成優良的品格，趨向至善的大道，或許可以挽回日下之世風，企求大同的世界。</p>
<p>在這裏，我要提出二點，以資討論，就是美育方面所應注意的；一是美性，二是美行。美性是內在的，美行是外演的。人的性是善是惡，有種種的解釋及原因，現在可置不論。但無論善惡，我們總須使他趨向於更美更善之境。怎樣使其趨向更美更善的境界？那就須要美的教育來潛移默化，陶冶　治；入芝蘭之室久而不聞其香，芝蘭就是美，在此室中，就能與之俱化。假如不入此室，或此室中沒有芝蘭，那就無從美化了。反之，醜惡亦然。我們從芝蘭之室而入鮑魚之肆必將掩鼻而不可一日居。那末我們受了美的教育以後，必不會再和醜惡的社會同流合污了。有了美性就有美行，美行是美性之表現於外的，也就是善德。我們受了美的陶融，對於處事的衡量，就以此爲標準，凡是不善的，就是不美的；反之不美的，也就是不善；人人如是社會就能趨向光明的大道了。</p>
<p>但是有人要說美術是奢侈的，是享樂的，在此經濟崩潰，物資缺乏的今日，救死謀生且不暇，尚有何心談到美與不美？又有人說：「美術是資產階級的享受，平民是無福與聞的。」這是把美的範圍看得太狹隘了。美有幾方面：富麗堂皇是美，清風明月未嘗不是美。畫家的境界不一定是表現高樓大廈，而是在鄉村茅舍；在陋巷貧民之中，也有最好的美的鏡頭；美與不美不是以富與貧來分而是以善和愛來區別的，這點美術家最能明瞭。所以我們今日來提倡美術，不是爲資產階段張目，而是提倡平民對於美的享受。更進一步言之，我國人民生活程度之低劣為人所共知，人民對於美的欣賞往往沒有機會；一般人大都處於污穢醜陋的環境中，心性如何能改善？假如能使平民多得美術之享受，如藝展，音樂會之舉行，公園之開闢，大道之修整，平民大廈之建築，使生活日趨美化，欣賞之程度逐漸提高，我相信罪惡的行為，也能因為陶融默化而無形減少，社會豈不是可以希望進步，又安見美術之爲奢侈呢？</p>
<p>因此我們提倡美術，在這萬惡的社會中，開闢出一個光明燦爛的園地，在這園地中，結成美好的果實，這是蔡先生當初的理想，也就是我們今日的工作。</p>

<h3 id="c130">愛用國貨運動 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>最近家庭工業社總經理胡伯翔先生，創導「愛用國貨運動」各方面贊助非常踴躍。胡先生是有名的畫家，平素對於一切事情，都十分鄭重，爲了避免誤解起見，對於「愛用國貨運動」，制定了下列二種規約：</p>
<p>一，愛用國貨運動，係用宣傳方法，謀糾正以用非必需之外貨爲榮之心理，除宣傳外，不得以任何行為干涉或妨害他人之自由。</p>
<p>二，愛用國貨運動，並非抵制外貨，推行宣傳時，務宜注意勿使用混淆。</p>
<p>此外，更為劃一起見，又制定了「用國貨最光榮」的標語，繪就圖樣，使各廠商在宣傳時，可以採用。</p>
<p>愛用國貨運動，的確是當前的要圖，這固然和挽救工業危機等有密切的關係，但是我們要認清「愛用國貨運動」，並不是挽救工業的唯一方法，所以在推行的時候，不必再牽涉其他大題目，祗要照着「愛用國貨運動」字面的解釋，切實做去，到了相當時候，就可以收到預期的效果，因為「愛用國貨運動」能夠做得好，已經可以有很大的影響。</p>
<p>事實上愛用國貨運動，不但在目前順應推行，即使在平時也應該推行，因為中國的工業，尚很幼稚，在幼稚的設備下產生的貨物，一定要得到大衆一致的愛護，方能使工業進步，貨品精進。銷行的範圍愈大，改進的進行就更容易着手，記得從前英國曾有Buy　British運動，提倡本國製造的貨品，所以如果每一個人是愛國的話，他就應該愛本國工廠的出品，愛護本國的工業。</p>
<p>「愛用國貨運動」並不是抵制或反對外貨運動，因為有許多本國不能製造生產的東西，這是需要從國外輸入的。反轉來講，凡是本國出品，能夠應用的，就不必以購用外貨爲榮了。</p>
<p>爲了解釋便利起見，我們可以把貨物分為生產者的貨物Producer＇s　Goods和消費者的貨物Consumer＇s　Goods來講。我們目前需要從國外輸入生產者的貨物，諸如機器，設備，以及必須的原料等等，暫時我們尚不需要輸入消費者的貨物，諸如各種奢侈品。</p>
<p>去年美國「讀者文摘」中，有一篇「廣大世界給予美國的機會」的文字，在美國戰後的計劃，是要扶助各個工業落後的國家，使他們工業化起來，因此美國就可以把許多生產者的貨物，輸給這些落後的國家，到了相當時期，這些國家已經工業化了，他們的人民，就能夠買各種消費者的用品，這在美國，當然始終是總生意方面着想，但對於被扶助的國家，祗要自己爭氣，也是沒有什麽損害的。</p>
<p>然而勝利以後的中國，固然有一部份工廠在訂購機器，但市上充斥的，却是大量的消費者的貨物，這在美國人也許認為始料所不及（雖則事實上美國因為工潮的關係，機器的生產量尚未達到理想的程度）。</p>
<p>目前的「愛用國貨運動」，是一種正糾正錯誤心理的運動。心理在現代一切建設中，佔着很重要的地位。在作戰時，需要有健全的心理，在建設時也要有健全的心理。實際上，愛用國貨運動，是一種培養自尊心理的基本工作，我們時常可以聽到美國人說我們美國人Ｗe　Americans，英國人說我們英國人We　Bristhers，但很不容易聽到本國人說我們中國人是怎樣怎樣的。</p>
<p>我們熱誠希望「愛用國貨運動」能夠爲一切心理建設工作，做一個良好的起點。</p>

<p>鋁板屋頂，玻璃牆，水泥釘子</p>
<p>科學正以巨大的力量侵入每一個屋子，每一個家庭。美國政府在最近幾年內建築數百萬新式家庭住屋的計劃，刺激了無數新的建築材料與裝置的發明。任何一種發明，一經證明有用，即將大量製造。</p>
<p>研究工作正以空前的速度在進行着，新的產物在計劃，舊的在改進。在屋頂的蓋造，鑲板，絕緣物質方面都已有長足的進步。尤其是鋁，現在有了很多種用途。鋁箔絕緣板應用於各種形式中，都很容易裝置而且經久不壤，對熱的反射力很強。鋁再加工特種增加絕緣力的玻璃纖維和增加強度的鋼，可以做外牆的包裹物。鋁製的遮陽和百葉窗可以減少熱度百分之七十五：一面因為是磨光的，足以反射熱量；在另一方面蒙以絲以阻止熱量的吸收。在還正進行的試騐是把建築外牆的石頭和磚代之以鋁；鋁的拱側，窗子，屋頂已常見於新的建築了。</p>
<p>鋼鐵工廠已出產爲建築一家或兩家住屋特別設計的建築鋼。平的，波狀的鋼片，不需要油漆就可以做廉價的屋頂之用，另有一種鋁合金也有同樣優美而耐久的性質，這種合金是用瀝青化合物，碎石粉，雲母在一定的熱和壓力之下製成的。</p>
<p>塑造也大大的應用於新屋的建造。建築浴室和廚房，建築整塊的地板，並且使地板和下面一層樓得天花板結合起來，都用塑造的方法。以塑造的方法做的水門汀釘子已代替了舊式的鐵釘。</p>
<p>玻璃也是建築材料中很有用的一項，玻璃磚可以造裏墻和外牆。有一種新的玻璃磚可以做絕緣之用，這種玻璃磚是把玻璃線捆在一起而成的。這樣做成的玻璃也可以用來做遊戲室的墻，使聲音不傳到外面去。新的石棉和疊木的合成品用來做鐵板，絕緣板，隔牆。</p>
<p>電子力和熱在設備完全的房子，建築方面達到新的工業水準。在西部的一個工廠裏，鑲嵌木板的工作是利用高週率的無線電波的力量的。</p>

<p>「玻璃皮包」「玻璃皮帶」「玻璃雨衣」「玻璃木梳」……「玻璃」的東西層出不窮，你知道這種「玻璃」東西的原名呌什麽嗎？它呌「普拉斯蒂克」（Plastic）又稱為「可塑體」。</p>
<p>普拉斯蒂克的製成品在美國已司空見慣，但是對於大多數人還是不失其神秘。它不像水泥，泥，油灰一般簡單東西，它是現代有機化學一種產品。</p>
<p>普拉斯蒂克最初於一八六九年發現，其時化學家海特（Gohn　Wesley　Hyatt）用硝酸，與樟榔製成璐珞，這種新混合物初被用以製造以前用象牙製造的彈子。以後這種物質就以「賽璐珞」之名流傳於世，它至今還是普拉斯蒂克中最有用一種。它的主要缺點是易燃性。因此以後又發明出較安全的賽璐珞原料，名為賽璐珞－醋酸鹽，目前大量生產的非燃性的影片就用這種原料製成。</p>
<p>到一九三〇年普拉斯蒂克已發明了好幾種，每種所有它的特性，可充某種用途。當戰爭開始時，普拉斯蒂克發揮了許多新的用途。在每一種較複雜的作戰機件中，普拉斯蒂克都担任了重要的作用。戰時美國普拉斯蒂克工業的產品被軍隊方面吸收了百分之八十五。而其餘的產品也多半是比較重要的生產品。現在新式的戰艦使用着一千種普拉斯蒂克用品。而普通飛機上也有二百種之多。</p>
<p>現在到承平時間，普拉斯蒂克的製造商已定下了平時的製造計劃，他們將利用戰事的經騐，用以製造各種平時民用的貨品。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>原料</p>
<p>一個從事生產的企業，有了廠房，設備和人，決不能缺少原料，因為沒有原料，就不能做成貨品，到市場上或銷售，也就不能獲得利潤。</p>
<p>關於原料是要看各個企業不同的情形而定的，譬如說一家汽車製造廠，那末他們所做的工作，大部份是屬於裝配方面的，向各個不同的地方去購買必須的物件，從事裝配。</p>
<p>有許多大工業，那末原料的來源是由公司自身所據有的，例如美國鋼鐵公司，不但設有煉鋼廠，而且還據有煤礦和鐵礦，使他們對於原料，可以自供自給，不必向別人去求取。</p>
<p>在通常一般製造廠，那末可以看事實的需要，去採辦各種原料，但在採購原料方面，有下列幾個原則是必需加以考慮的：</p>
<p>第一，原料的來源，必須繼續，不能中斷：</p>
<p>原料是製造貨品所必需的，那末要使生產工作繼續不斷，原料的來源決不能時有時無，所以要有精密的預算，當然這和推銷工作是有很密切的關係的，所以在貨品製造之前，應該徵求營業部份的意見，大約一年之間可以銷多少，這在營業部份就需要研究市上同類的貨品，有多少銷路</p>
<p>如果原料的供應中斷以後，那末一方面市面上要發生缺貨的現象，同時機器，工人都要停頓起來，使公司蒙受極大的損失，但反轉來講，原料也不能存得過多，因為過多而銷路不好，就要成為供過於求的現象，使流動資金呆住而周轉不靈。</p>
<p>第二，原料的價格，必須維持平衡不能驟然增加：</p>
<p>原料是構成貨品成本的主要條件之一，所以爲求維持貨品售價利潤起見，原料的價格，不能突然增加，雖則原料價格增高以後，也可以增加售價，但屢次增加貨品的售價，不免使銷路減少，所以下列兩種現象就不免要發生：</p>
<p>甲，銷路減少利潤減少：這是很容易說明的，譬如每月可銷一百件，每件可得利益二百元，共計利益二萬元，如果銷路減少了一半，那末利潤也就要減少一半，不但如此，公司的開支全部要使五十件貨品负担，所以成本還要增加，即使表面上的利潤，也不能獲得。</p>
<p>乙，成本增加，利潤減少：本來製造一件貨品，需成本八十元，售一百元，可得利潤二十元。但製造成本增加以後，萬一不宜於增加售價，那末利潤就要減少。</p>
<p>對於貨品的銷行，在一般情形之下，不能由製造廠自定售價隨時更動，因為市面上的貨品，往往不止一種，如果別人每件賣一百元，除非貨品的品質更為優良，惟有減少利潤，減少利潤的結果，很容易使公司虧蝕，甚至於一蹶不振。</p>

<h3 id="c135">一封來信 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>中央銀行業務局有四位先生給本人一封信，是對於「復員同人被當局不合理的調派」一個呼籲，信上有一段說：</p>
<p>貝總裁明察本行同人在八年抗戰中努力工作，以及所受之艱苦，認此次隨政府復員同人，應一律留總行服務，不得任意外調，並頒發吿全體同人書，慰勉有加。本行各局處主管當局，亦同具此心，均能秉承貝總裁意旨，惟業務局方面竟……</p>
<p>倘使是事實，我倒有一點意見。</p>
<p>抗戰的艱苦，我們都已身受到了，在這受難的大時代中，淪陷區內的同胞，祇要不是靦顏事敵甘心附逆者，也同樣的艱苦。我們原不應存「我是參加抗戰的」「我是從後方來的」特殊尊貴心理，希冀有特殊的待遇。不過，當局爲體恤隨政府，跋涉流離，冒砲火耐飢寒的辛勞，對參加大後方的工作者，別有慰勉，亦係情理法所應有之義，中央銀行對復員同人優遇一點，能做也應該做的。</p>
<p>不過一個機關或一個團體的用人行政，自有它的規章，倘使必要，而且合理合法有權作任何處置，我們不能以「隨政府復員」作理由而抗不受命，倘使不合理不合法，我們當然可以拒絕，並且可以控訴。</p>
<p>中央銀行業務局四位先生的來函，我們非常同情，其所以沒有發表者，信中還缺少一點更具體的事實。</p>
<h3 id="c136">「人人有報看，個個有書讀。」 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 才絮</p>
<p>建議：跑馬廳開設上海文化城</p>
<p>七月十四日自由談上的「對市立圖書館的意見」一文中，向管理當局陳述了四點需要改善的地方，大意是：（一）西文書多於中文書，且看不到新的雜誌。（二）目錄箱全是西文。（三）岡書館業務，如借書，電梯等於星期日均吿停頓：（四）樓梯不整潔。</p>
<p>圖書館是人們精神食糧供給地，在文化低落的中國，對於圖書館的設備，是向來簡陋的，上海號稱文化之邦，但是我懷疑當外人來到這個「文化之邦」的時候，除了表面的繁華和奢侈之外，又向那兒去找一絲文化的氣息？</p>
<p>上海市立圖書館的存在，是富有歷史性和含有重大意義的。記者早想明瞭接收以後的情形，所以在讀到了那篇文字後，特地作了一次訪問。</p>
<p>記者趨訪時，周館長正親自致書本報，準備有所解答，看見了記者，就笑嘻嘻地說：「你來得正好，請你代爲轉達」。他首先表示，對於外界的批評，一定虛心接受，並積極改進。不過那篇文中所列的一二兩點，實在是一種誤會。館中的中文書不但沒有比西文書少，而且還超過了兩倍。現在館巾有西文書二一·二六〇本，中文書九七。一七八本，因爲由前英工部局接收下來的時候，凌亂不堪，一時難以加以整理。到現在還在全力編排中。目錄箱中找不到中文，那正是因爲編號工作尙未完成的緣故。近日來正由十餘人加緊趕編。下月中必能將第一集目錄完成。對於添備新書，因爲經費有限，實在無法採購，現有最新中西雜誌約共五十多種，經常供讀者閱讀，具所以沒有發現，那正是由於星期日的緣故。市立圖書館因爲工　人員欠缺，在輪流分配時，往往星期日無法照常，因此使讀者　　時　到影響。但周館長也明白圖書館在例假日的重要性所以從這星期起已經開始調整，務使讀者不因星期日而受到任何妨礙。又周館長表明，電梯的停駛，並不是爲了星期日，而是由於這幾天來，電梯恰好損壞，已經停駛多日了。對於樓梯的不　凈，周館長完全承認並表示遺憾。因爲那裏的灰塵實在太多，此後周館長將命令工役每日打掃二次，並已添備痰盂十餘只。</p>
<p>接着周館黄吿訴記者，該館現有讀者總數約三萬餘人，平均每天到館人數約一千餘人，其中學生佔百分之四十，工商界百分之四十，公務員，軍人等百分之二十，目前最感缺乏的書籍是中文小說，差不多有三分之二的讀者愛讀這類書。所以規定借中文小說每次以一本爲限，且須於一星期中歸還。目前行政上最感困難的是讀者的不能合作，往往有許多人借了名貴的書不還，照着他的申請書上的舖保去找，才知道根本是偽造的，所以館方在發給借書證前必先行對保，而這實在是件繁重的工作。有的在徐家匯，浦東，楊樹浦，等等地方，不知要化費多少時間，同時讀者的不遵守公共道德，也實在令館方痛心的，一批新雜誌到後，在一星期中就失竊一半，把書本中的照片畫面等撕去，更是司空見慣，這種有損他人，過分自私的行爲，必須讀者羣起制止！</p>
<p>最後，周館長說，依照他的計劃，上海至少需要五所公共圖書館，分設在東西北中各區，目前僅有的，除四馬路總館外，有南巿一分館，藏書僅一萬餘本。</p>
<p>周館長曾經有個一個大的計劃——把本巿跑馬廳　作文化城，裏面分設體育館，圖書館，博物館等，經費的籌募，可由政府發行公債。這個計劃曾於半年前向錢巿長建議過，但是看到目前上海的房荒，市府的拮据，計劃的實現，眞是遙遙無期了！</p>
<p>但是，我們總在渴望着：人人有報看，個個有書讀！</p>
<h3 id="c137">電車過站不停難爲了小市民 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 高敏新</p>
<p>昨讀本刋，知現在上海電車，使人損精神，費時間，極有向當局提議糾正之必要，以符價廉穩速之旨。</p>
<p>中段旣設紅柱，乃表示站頭，使乘客上下，別種車輪亦存心有人上上下下，謹防傷人，有時車中，並不擁擠，經站不停，或停而車門不開。叮叮一響，車就開走，使候車者大上其當，携重年老婦孺等雨淋日晒，一概不管，且促使第二部電車秩序紊亂。因前部不放上幾人，地下越等越多，力强者恐失去此部機會拼命軋上，亦不管你等老幼矣。越是此種情形，售票者免多麻煩，越不要停車，或開車門。</p>
<p>如三路有軌電車，西行福州路，東行山海關路或大通路站十九不停。見有一部，幸而停站，機會難得，力爭而上。鄙人七月十六日作最後存心一試，下午六時十八分起，在大新街福州路口候三路西開，自拖車第一四八號以前六輛，經過不停，司機說已四部未停，彼概不理。無論舉手高呼，冒險　住更不理。最後天將黑，見開麥根路車亦已回轉，已七點二十八分，計費一點另十分之時間，總歸無效，乃至南京路上車站。候在彼處仍有二三十人，但車中極甚寬餘，前後亦不滿坐椅。</p>
<p>想彼等司機及售票者，以爲何不再跑幾步，但乘客以爲有紅柱是必停之站，況且由東江西路來，已跑不少路矣。</p>
<p>此是一例而已，別站同此情形亦不少，總望糾正恢復長距離中間之舊站頭，以利平民爲宗旨。</p>
<h3 id="c138">免費乘車 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 陳中繼</p>
<p>「時間即金錢」這句話，對於都巿生活者聽來，更覺親切，但我們每天可以看到有許多人都在提着兩條腿在路上走。豈不浪費？難道這些人不愛乘車，不愛節省時間嗎？不，實在是因爲交通太不方便了，你看今日的上海連最普通的電車，也不易享受。</p>
<p>但是在另一方面，大馬路上飛馳如織的不也是汽車嗎？瞧！一輛八汽缸的大轎車內，除了開車的外，只坐着一個嬌小的姨太太躱在車角裏，與和快要爆裂的沙丁魚罐頭相仿的電車，相較之下，是一幅多麼滑稽的諷刺畫？爲什麽一方面有人無車坐，另一方面却有車無人坐，或不准人坐呢？</p>
<p>再來讓我們來看看汽車的發祥地美國：汽車在美國很普遍，差不多每一個家庭，就有一輛自備汽車，但是沒有機會自備汽車的人還是很多。他們怎麽辦呢？據久居美國的來人說：在美國只要你看見有空着的汽車，就可要求開車的給你搭車。那時候開車的決不會拒絕請求，他一定會給你免費乘車，尤其每星期六在近學校的公路旁，都睡滿了學生，一見進城的自備車，就請求搭乘，車主們非常樂於接受；因爲在寂寞的旅途上，能够多一個同伴加入，不是挺有趣的嗎？何况美國人又是喜歡交朋友的。</p>
<p>就是在上海的美軍車輛也是可以請求免費搭乘的，只要開車的不是白俄人或猶太人，而且不是寫明專屬某某部隊用的公務車子，無論是什麼車差不多是有求必應的。筆者自己也有過四次經驗。</p>
<p>但是爲什麼在上海的中國人所有的汽車却不然呢？也許不曾有人去請求坐在自備車內的大腹賈，要免費搭車，但是即使你有勇氣去請求的話，除了滿口不答應之外，一定會笑你是神經病！</p>
<p>汽車是美國來的，坐自備汽車的朋友在考究車身機件是否件件皆出自美國的時候，爲什麼偏不學學人家好的地方呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Marshal Ma Returns to Nanjing Today; The Situation May See New Decisions; U.S. Ambassador Says Hopes for the Future Remain Strong <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] The political consultation atmosphere in the capital has been stagnant for over a week. Especially in the past three days, Special Envoy Marshall went to Kuling, Mr. Zhou Enlai shuttled between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Henan, and people from the Democratic League were busy with the assassination of Li and Wen in Kunming. As a result, Yu Dawei told reporters that he could only say, "Light will eventually come." Shao Lizi even had several days of leisure, accompanying his wife in the Na Min courtyard in the sweltering heat. However, this kind of superficial stagnation should not last too long. Currently, the general public's speculation seems to be not "When will talks resume?" but "Where will talks resume?" It is heard that the government is arranging accommodations for all parties in Lushan. Marshal Ma, who is returning to Nanjing tomorrow, also has the mission of urging the CCP representatives to go up the mountain. Therefore, as of tonight, although government representatives and people from various parties have no intention of going to Xunyang, once Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai return to Nanjing tomorrow, there will be new decisions.</p>
<p>[Our Kuling dispatch of the 21st] Regarding the Chairman's announcement, according to the Chairman's secretary, the Chairman had consultations with Ambassador Stuart on this matter. The details are unknown, but there are two possible speculations: (1) Ambassador Stuart and the Chairman have already reached an agreement; (2) The announcement was an idea discussed during the meeting between Stuart and the Chairman. After Marshal Ma arrives in Nanjing tomorrow and consults with Ambassador Stuart, and then contacts the Chairman, a decision on the Chairman's important actions can be made.</p>
<p>[Our Kuling dispatch of the 21st] Special Envoy Marshall has decided to leave Kuling at 7:30 tomorrow morning and take a special plane from Jiujiang at around 10:00 AM, arriving in Nanjing before noon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] U.S. Ambassador Stuart, having caught a cold before leaving Peiping, suffered from increased coughing due to the cooler climate after arriving in Kuling. Although it was Sunday today, the Ambassador still immersed himself in work all day, drafting documents, but declined to see guests. At 4:00 PM, he received this newspaper's reporter at his residence. He stated that he plans to return to Peiping on the 23rd to handle affairs at Yenching University, and after a short stay, he will return to Nanjing. Whether he will go to Lushan again has not yet been decided, but if the Chairman invites him by telegram, he will go at any time. When asked about the Ambassador's opinion on the peace talks after his talks with the Chairman in Lushan, he replied that he has always had hope for the future of the negotiations and believes that a reasonable solution can eventually be found, because the current situation in China is very different from when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown or when fighting against Japan. This is purely a domestic dispute. The main reason why the two sides cannot coordinate is mutual suspicion and fear. If further understanding can be sought, then this psychological haze can be dispelled. When asked how long this would take, the Ambassador said, "It is not yet known." The Ambassador also emphasized to the reporter that he had told Chairman Chiang that he is a friend of China and should not be seen as an American Ambassador. He only hopes to do his best to help China achieve true peace. The current work is indeed extremely difficult, but he is determined to combine subjective understanding with various objective materials, study diligently, and seek a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Rare Honor for Kuling Church; Chairman and Marshal Visited Yesterday; Both Attended Worship and Prayed with Their Wives <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Kuling dispatch by telephone of the 21st] Chairman Chiang and his wife, at 10:20 AM today, went to the Chinese Church in front of Marshal Marshall's residence to worship and pray with Marshal Marshall and his wife, also singing American hymns. The service concluded at 12:20 PM. At 6:00 PM, Chairman Chiang and his wife, together with Marshal Marshall and his wife, each rode in sedan chairs, a total of four, and visited Great Heaven Lake. Around 7:00 PM, they had a picnic at Immortal Cave, and returned happily around 8:00 PM in the drizzle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 21st] Today is the Sabbath. The Chinese Christian Church, located between the east and west roads of the Kuling River, held a worship service at 11:00 AM. Four distinguished parishioners participated, which is truly a rare honor in the history of the church. These four distinguished parishioners were Marshal Marshall and his wife, and Chairman Chiang and his wife. Marshal Marshall and his wife sat in the first row on the right side of the church, with Chairman Chiang and his wife sitting behind them. The prayer was presided over by Chamberlain, a British pastor. After the prayer, the pastor cited a passage from the first section of the eleventh chapter of John to speak about the doctrine of eternal life and sang several hymns. After the service, Marshal Marshall and his wife invited Chairman Chiang and his wife to lunch at their residence. In the afternoon at 6:00 PM, Chairman Chiang and his wife invited Marshal Marshall and his wife to visit Tianchi Mountain, which is five miles from Kuling. They also had a picnic there. This place is the northwestern peak of Lushan. Standing and looking into the distance, it resembles a straight furrow. Marshal Marshall and his wife, and Chairman Chiang and his wife returned late at night.</p>

<p>[Our Kuling dispatch of the 21st] This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Madame Chiang held a tea party to entertain old friends in Kuling, mostly British and American. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of these foreign residents never left Lushan. During the tea party, Madame Chiang inquired in detail about the various remaining conditions after Kuling was occupied by the enemy. It is said that Madame Chiang originally had many valuable books hidden in her villa in Kuling, but they were scattered and lost over the past eight years. During today's tea party, in addition to expressing her regret, Madame Chiang requested assistance from her old friends, hoping to recover some of them.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] General Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, left Nanjing at 2:30 PM today on a C51 special plane to Jiujiang. Our reporter specifically visited him at the airport and asked him to say a word or two about his trip to the Northeast. Gu did not express anything. The reporter then asked if his trip to Lushan would involve a report to the Chairman. Gu said, "Military personnel travel back and forth at any time, there is nothing to report." He then boarded the plane and took off. It is understood that Gu will return to Nanjing within a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 21st] Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, arrived in Kuling from Nanjing at 6:00 PM on the 21st and will pay a visit to Chairman Chiang to report on the situation in the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Communist Troops on Both Sides of the Southern Section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway; Have Fallen into a State of Wandering; Remnants in Eastern Hubei Harass the Anhui Border <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 21st] According to official comprehensive reports, as of the 18th, the remaining Communist troops in the eastern and western regions of the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway have been wandering. On the east side of the railway, the Communist troops under Zhang Lixue have harassed more than ten counties and districts and recently fled to the border area between Luotian and Yingshan, where their property was looted. In Huangmei, Guangji, Xishui, and other counties, there are still scattered Communist troops hiding, and people are often kidnapped and extorted. On the west side of the railway, the Communist troops who infiltrated Baokang have successively passed through Taikou, Qingfengzhen, and Xiemaho, attempting to invade the southwestern mountainous area of Fangxian. In addition, the Communist troops who failed to cross the river from Liushuigou were intercepted by the security team, and some of them fled back to Wujiadian and Wujindian, south of Zaoyang.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 21st] According to a military announcement: (A) In the area between Huang'an, Jingfu, Macheng, Luotian, Yingshan, Xishui, and Huanggang, the people are utterly destitute after being harassed by the Communist troops. Currently, there are scattered bandits lurking, disturbing the people, who are constantly preparing to flee. (B) The remnants of the Communist troops under Zhang Tixue and others, who harassed eastern Hubei, numbering about 3,000, fled from Changtangyan, Dawushan (north of Luotian), and Jinyangpu (north of Yingshan) to Qianshan and Taihu in Anhui Province in mid-month. (C) The remnants of the Communist troops under Zhang Tixue, numbering about 2,000, who fled northeast of Guanting in central and northern Anhui, harassed the vicinity of Mingguang in eastern Anhui on the 20th and damaged a section of the railway.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 21st] According to a military announcement at 2:00 AM this morning: (A) The Communist troops under Wang Shuhan, who crossed the Xiang River and fled west, divided into three routes, east, south, and north, to encircle and attack Fangxian starting on the 18th. The people in the city suffered heavy casualties. The county is currently being defended by the police force. (B) The Communist troops under Xian Liannian, who crossed the Dan River and fled west, continued to flee westward through Nanhuatang. On the 19th, their vanguard reached Manchuan Pass, and the main force of several thousand people was harassing the area around Zhaojiachuan Street and Fangjiadian. (C) More than 1,000 Communist troops who failed to cross the river at Akou turned and fled towards the area of Lutouzhen, northeast of Zaoyang. On the 17th, they reached Liujiahe, and a small part of them disguised themselves as plainclothes troops and remained active near Akou, committing rape, robbery, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st] About 2,000 Communist troops who invaded Shaanxi Province from Jingziguan in southern Henan have been fleeing westward along mountain paths and small roads for days. One route has crossed Gaonan and fled towards Longjuzhai, and the other route has fled towards Shanyang.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 20th] On the 16th of this month, a military mediation department plane flew from Zhangjiakou to the West Suburb Airport in Peiping. The plane carried several CCP personnel. When the luggage of the CCP representatives entered the city through Xizhimen, they refused inspection by the military police, which caused a misunderstanding. The situation was deadlocked until the afternoon of the 18th without a resolution. On the 19th, the issue was discussed at a meeting of the Three-Man Committee of the Military Mediation Department. On the suggestion of the American side, it was decided that the Military Mediation Department would conduct the inspection. The luggage was taken to the Military Mediation Department at 6:00 PM that afternoon, and the department sent a team of government representative Hai Chun, CCP representative Lei Yingfu, and American representative Freeman to conduct the inspection together. American Commissioner Robertson also attended. As a result, they found Jin-Cha-Ji Daily, Central Bank banknotes, radio equipment, and about 400 taels of gold. Part of the items has been retrieved by the CCP. The incident has now come to an end.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] Eight new ships donated by the United States to our country arrived at Xiaguan at 6:07 PM tonight. By 6:30 PM, the ships were docked at their designated locations. The flagship Taikang led the way, and a huge flag fluttered in the wind, displaying a heroic posture. People waiting at the pier cheered and jumped for joy. Among the crowds were many young women holding children's hands, all looking forward, expecting the return of the naval heroes who had been away for more than a year. The Naval Headquarters had also made prior arrangements for liaison and reception. Chief of Staff Zhou also personally welcomed them. After dealing with today's busy official duties, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng also drove to the pier at 9:00 PM and boarded the ship on a specially prepared speedboat for inspection. The entire crew welcomed him with the most enthusiastic emotions. In the twilight, our reporter visited the Taikang on the Yongxing speedboat, led by Deputy Captain Li Yu for a tour. The officers and soldiers of the fleet left the motherland in December 1944 and arrived in the United States in February of the following year. They immediately began basic training, with Americans as instructors. There were nearly a thousand Chinese sailors, including more than 70 officers, some of whom had degrees in shipbuilding from Jiaotong University, while others had ordinary secondary education. However, they were all healthy, lively, and full of vigor. The basic training was completed in ten months, and they then went to Cuba for further training. While in the United States, they participated in various competitions and received the highest honors. Because the motherland had won victory and the training had been completed, they left Cuba on April 6 to return home. They were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese at various ports along the way, who presented them with various valuable gifts. On July 13, they passed through Yokohama, Japan, where they were inspected by General He Yingqin. They arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Their future missions will be determined by orders. The ships are very new. The Taikang has a displacement of 1,400 tons and was built in 1943. The ships are equipped with various equipment for combatting aircraft and submarines, but because of secrecy, they cannot be listed. Our reporter spoke with several sailors and found that they are currently eager to be relieved of the following two concerns: one is that they have been away from the motherland for too long and are not familiar with the domestic political situation, and the other is that they have been at sea for too long and feel unfamiliar with the mainland. It is heard that they will remain in Nanjing for about a day or two before sailing to Shanghai. It is also heard that the review ceremony for the eight new ships is scheduled for the 24th, and Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng will personally preside over it at that time.</p>

(2) On the Liuhe front, the Communist troops have besieged Liuhe on three sides with more than 30,000 troops since the 14th of this month. After the National Army met them head-on, the Communist troops collapsed and retreated. Our National Army has recovered Yujiahe, an important point in front of Tianchang. It is rumored that the vanguard troops have advanced to Tianchang. (3) On the Taixing front, the National Army encountered thirteen units of Communist troops with two countries of troops. After fierce fighting, they finally defeated the Communist troops, recovered Taixing, and killed more than 20,000 Communist troops. (4) The National Army's defenses on the Yangtai front are as solid as a copper wall and an iron fortress. The Communist troops' invasion is no different from hitting a stone with an egg. Finally, regarding the situation in northern Jiangsu, the reporters were told that dawn will break in a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Ambassador Koo's Solemn Declaration: The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Should Resume Transporting Supplies. There is Absolutely No Discrimination in Our Distribution of Supplies. The Communist Military Region Actually Receives More Than Other Areas. <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 20th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, issued a statement denying that the Chinese government discriminated against the Communist Party in the distribution of UNRRA supplies. He stated: The Chinese government requests the immediate resumption of UNRRA's transport of all supplies to China. The Chinese government has thoroughly investigated the UNRRA personnel in China who promoted the reduction of food shipments by Lagenia two months ago. UNRRA personnel had accused that the Communist areas did not receive a fair share of relief supplies, and the delivery of supplies to the interior was also greatly delayed. The investigation results show that the Communist areas along the Yellow River received more supplies than any comparable region. At the same time, Zheng Baonan, director of the Executive Yuan's office in Washington, also issued a statement defending China's relief policy, stating that relief goods have been transported to the "truly needy" Communist areas. The Chinese government has thoroughly investigated all accusations made by UNRRA personnel. The results of the investigation show that supplies are strictly distributed according to the needs of each region, without any discrimination, as publicly announced by Jiang Tingfu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration. The famine in any area under Communist control is not as severe as in the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei. In fact, more relief supplies have been shipped to the Communist area along the Yellow River than to any other comparable area. The statement also stated: We should also note that food accounts for almost 80 percent of the UNRRA supplies that China has received to date. Compared with other disaster areas, the areas under Communist control, except for the small pocket-shaped areas of northern Jiangsu and northern Hubei, are fortunately not lacking food.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 20th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, issued a statement tonight, firmly demanding that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration resume the transport of relief supplies to China, and indirectly blaming UNRRA itself for the delay in the distribution of supplies. It is claimed that the smooth distribution of relief supplies has been greatly hindered by certain difficult circumstances that China cannot control. For example, items obtained overseas are not notified in advance, there are no shipping manifests or invoices for the cargo, and the machines that arrive are either not what China requested or lack important parts and cannot be used. There are also large quantities of canned food that are already spoiled upon receipt and have to be discarded. The Chinese government has asked UNRRA to start shipping again and has notified the US government of the actual situation.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 21st] The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference held its second general assembly at 8:00 am on the 21st. The chairman was Li Chaoying, Director of Education, with a total of 56 attendees, including Chairman Shen Honglie, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, and Speaker of the Provisional Council Zhu Xianwen. Twenty-two were absent. First, Mayor Zhou reported on the administrative work of Hangzhou City in the past six months, stating: Hangzhou City currently has a population of 447,600, a decrease of one-quarter compared to before the war. Although the provincial government's revenue has increased monthly, it is still insufficient to meet expenses. It can only spend according to its means. The main achievements include the establishment of 20 new schools, the implementation of universal education, the establishment of a civil food regulation committee, the adjustment of prices, the improvement of sanitation, the dredging of waterways, and the restoration of electric lights on the Su and Bai Dams. Then, the commissioners of the eleven districts reported in turn on the administrative work of each district, all focusing on suppressing bandits, ensuring public security, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and revitalizing construction. All districts deeply felt the financial difficulties. In particular, Yu Shugong, the commissioner of the second district, said loudly at the meeting because the income was not enough for distribution, "The monthly income of the county magistrate is only over 63,000 yuan, and the monthly income of the staff is only over 23,000 yuan. Under these circumstances where it is not enough to maintain life, it often creates a phenomenon where no official is not corrupt. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the conference can discuss concrete measures to solve the problem." The meeting adjourned in the afternoon, and Chairman Shen hosted all attendees from 9:00 pm to 11:00 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Case of Japanese Police Shooting Taiwanese Compatriots: Statement by Our Delegation. Taiwanese Vendors Have Been Dispersed by Our Consulate. Japanese Police Opened Fire Without Cause, Resulting in a Bloody Incident. <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 20th Special Dispatch] The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has taken emergency measures to prevent the recurrence of the shooting tragedy between Taiwanese people and Japanese police last night, ordering the closure of black markets in the Shinbashi and Shibuya districts, to be reopened after further notice. The blockade of the above two conflict sites may eliminate the brawls arising from disputes between Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese rogues in these black markets. Our delegation to Japan issued a statement tonight regarding the shooting incident last night, the full text of which is as follows: When peace returned to the Pacific, Taiwanese compatriots in Japan attracted much attention. After fifty years of harsh rule by Japanese imperialists, Taiwanese compatriots suddenly became Chinese people again. The majority of Taiwanese in Tokyo, in order to make a living, rented a large area in Shinbashi to set up open-air stalls like those in Tokyo's "Rue Tian Huo Ju" (open-air stalls). Since the arrival of the US occupation forces in Japan, these Taiwanese have been operating stalls. The land base of these open-air stalls belongs to a certain Japanese company. From the 3rd of this month, the company owner has requested to terminate the lease. Although the Taiwanese have negotiated many times, they have not been successful. Subsequently, the company used force to drive out these Taiwanese vendors, resulting in a bloody tragedy that began as a verbal dispute. On July 19th, the company planned a large-scale brawl, gathering thousands of so-called Japanese rogues. Taiwanese compatriots also gathered hundreds of people to prepare for self-defense. Lin Dingping of our consulate in Tokyo made many efforts to disperse the Taiwanese compatriots. Unfortunately, these dispersed Taiwanese compatriots were shot at by Japanese police when they passed by a Japanese police station, killing four and injuring or mortally wounding twenty. The statement concludes: The Chinese Consulate considers this matter very serious and is taking appropriate steps to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] News from Dalian has been quiet for a long time. According to visitors, the mayor of Dalian is currently Deng Zixiang, who was originally the president of the Chamber of Commerce and a puppet in name only. Real power is in the hands of Deputy Mayor Chen Yuntao. There are also so-called "Three Lights," leaders with similar pseudonyms, in charge of everything. Han Guang is in charge of espionage, Song Guang is promoting politics, and Zhou Guang is responsible for security. The main force of the Communist army is mostly concentrated in the Piziwo area, blockading the surrounding area and checking household registrations. Anyone over the age of sixteen on the streets is drafted into the army. All young residents must serve in the military. They are even more active in the liquidation work. Zhang Benzheng, a giant in Dalian, is over 83 years old and has been forced to flee abroad, and his children and grandchildren have been detained. Rogues are taking advantage of the situation to rise up, committing crimes, and people are very uneasy. Dalian's forests and fruit trees are famous in the world. Now, due to the lack of fuel, people are cutting them down at will, and they may even be listed as the "Four Lights" in the future. Also, due to difficult living conditions, residents are mostly selling clothes and pawning items. Used clothing is cheaper than elsewhere. In the past, there were those who made risky business ventures on their own, but now few go there.</p>

<p>[Hankou Correspondence] Regarding the agricultural loans of the China Farmers Bank in this city this year, it is learned that: (1) The amount of emergency agricultural loans is 250 million yuan. Since February of this year, most of them have been released until recently. There are 49 counties and cities that have been loaned. (2) The amount of ordinary agricultural loans is more than 500 million yuan.

However, the reporter had a detailed discussion with the person in charge of agricultural loans, and there are two points worth discussing regarding the loans that have been issued: (1) In terms of the target group, are they truly farmers?

<p>Loans for Cocoon Depreciation to Aid Farmers</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the rural economy of this county has been exploited by the enemy and puppet regime and has collapsed. After the victory, prices continued to rise, and the farmers' economy became increasingly difficult. After the spring plowing, most farmers lacked money to buy fertilizer, which greatly affected the autumn harvest. Moreover, the cooperative silkworm drying of the cooperative societies in various rural areas of this county cannot be sold in this autumn of cocoon depreciation, resulting in extreme economic difficulties for the farmers. Therefore, the cooperative societies presented petitions to the county government on the 18th, requesting approval to forward a letter to the Wuxi office of the China Farmers Bank for loans to aid them.</p>

<p>Three passenger cars traveling from Quzhou to Lanxi were forced to stop by more than ten bandits with two submachine guns and seven other firearms when passing through Liangtoumen, three miles near Luobu on the 18th, under the pretext of inspection. A total of more than seven million yuan in cash from all passengers was robbed and immediately fled. Now on the highways of Zhejiang Province, the remote areas along the road are not peaceful, and passengers are all vigilant and unwilling to carry banknotes with them, most of them remit money through the bank. As a result, bank remittances to Hangzhou have suddenly increased, and the number of trucks on the highway has also decreased recently. One reason is that the social economy is increasingly sluggish, and the purchasing power of the people is limited, so there is no profit to be made. The second reason is that the highways pass through remote mountain areas, with few people and easy for bandits to appear. Therefore, the highways that were bustling with activity two or three months ago have become very deserted recently.</p>

<h3 id="e28">America's War-Abolition Movement <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Second World War ended nearly a year ago, and the call for preventing a Third World War has already begun. This implies that the God of War is still threatening us, meaning that the God of Peace cannot yet graciously descend on the earth. How anxious this makes us! However, anxiety is useless. We must strive to win peace and work to abolish war.</p>
<p>Recently, one of the representatives of the United States attending the foreign ministers' conference, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned to the country from Paris and reported to the Senate on the proceedings of the foreign ministers' conference, proposing a plan to prevent a Third World War. This is indeed good news for world peace. Connally's views on international politics have always been valued by the American government and public, and even by world opinion. In particular, this plan can be said to be his masterpiece. He personally experienced the turbulence of the foreign ministers' conference in Paris and deeply knows that the prospects for world peace are not optimistic. The bloodstains of the Second World War have not yet dried, and the crisis of a Third World War seems to be brewing. But he is not discouraged or disappointed, and he still uses all his wisdom and ability to formulate this war-abolition plan. In today's world, where humanity's struggle for peace has not yet succeeded, his sincerity is even more worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>Looking back at the war, although democratic countries were not necessarily able to take the lead in military terms, they were able to overcome any difficulties and achieve final victory because the major countries were truly united and unwavering. At that time, far-sighted politicians had already advocated that countries must maintain the spirit of striving for victory after the war and jointly build world peace. But once the enemy surrendered, the common goal no longer existed, and the actual interests of the countries were not entirely the same. As a result, "greed blinded wisdom," and their steps diverged. The psychology of suspicion and distrust grew imperceptibly. More than a year has passed since Germany surrendered, but true peace has not yet been realized. It was not until the recent foreign ministers' conference that it was decided to convene a peace conference of 21 European countries to sign peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. As for the German question, the four powers still had differing opinions and need to be discussed again in November of this year. The situation in the Far East is the same. Japan surrendered nearly a year ago, but the deadlock in Europe cannot be broken, and the Far East problem is even more difficult to solve independently. Therefore, Far East peace is also in a state of being within reach but not attainable.</p>
<p>But the Second World War lasted six years in Europe and eight years in the Far East, and the United States fought a bloody battle for four years before and after. Humanity has learned such a cruel lesson, and everyone should reflect deeply and sincerely desire peace! From the Far East to Europe, from Europe to the New World, under the whole world, who does not long for the eternal end of war? Although Willkie's dream of "One World" may not be realized immediately, President Roosevelt initiated the United Nations, and countries actually formed the United Nations together afterwards. If we still cannot have faith in "One World," it would truly be too much of a disservice to humanity's own wisdom.</p>
<p>Connally witnessed the crisis of the European situation in Paris and felt even more deeply the seriousness of future wars. Based on his research, he proposed seven war-abolition plans, which were earnest and sincere and should be praised and supported by all people of conscience. Roughly, his plan has five key points: (1) The United States should resolutely abide by the legal principles and the justice stipulated in the Atlantic Charter in all international negotiations, and advise other countries to do the same. (2) The United States should provide sufficient troops, aircraft, and warships to the United Nations Security Council for use in maintaining world peace. (3) The United States must maintain a strong army, navy, and air force to defend its territory and people and faithfully fulfill its obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. (4) The United States should sign agreements with relevant countries as early as possible to jointly control atomic energy and other large-scale weapons that destroy humanity. (5) The United States should fully support the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations to complete the various conditions necessary to maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Connally's plan is neither an overly high ideal nor a novel idea. We only feel that it is practical and easy to implement. Confucius once said, "Is benevolence far away? I desire benevolence, and benevolence arrives." We can also say now: Peace is not far from people. If humanity wants peace, the God of Peace can descend. We must advise the major countries to truly respect the United Nations organization. We must regard it as the God of Peace. We must, like Connally, advise our own countries to contribute their capabilities to the United Nations on the one hand and obey the resolutions of the United Nations and abide by the charter of the United Nations on the other. Everyone should only use words and not force in any disputes, and the world will be at peace. From Connally's plan, it can be seen that the United States today knows that the era of isolation has long passed. To enjoy peace and prosperity at home, we must first seek world peace and stability. Connally's plan is the first step that the United States, based on this understanding, is taking with sincerity towards this path. In short, the United States is willing to stand on the side of international justice, devote its full strength, and take the lead in supporting the United Nations organization, making it the most effective tool for maintaining world peace. We not only hope that both the US Senate and House of Representatives can adopt this war-abolition plan as the basic principle of US foreign policy in the future, but also pray that this legislative spirit can be unanimously adopted by peace-loving people all over the world, especially the powerful countries. We must respect the United Nations, and we must not abuse the "veto power" to weaken the United Nations and prevent it from taking action against aggressors. Only then can the post-war world enter a new era of peace and obtain a reliable guarantee.</p>
<p>"Stopping war is the way to use force." This war-abolition movement in the United States is the martial virtue of the United States. It is only because the United States has a strong army, navy, and air force that it can make good use of its military force to defend world peace. We hope for the success of the war-abolition movement, and we especially hope that China can also take on this responsibility without hesitation and exert the spirit of "stopping war as the way to use force" to contribute to the world's war-abolition movement.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th] Officials have announced that the Iranian government has delivered a note to the British ambassador to Iran protesting the entry of three British cruisers into the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th] Iranian Chief of Staff General Razmara met with the Minister of War this morning and immediately reported to Prime Minister Sadanah. Iranian political figures have said that the British Embassy has sent a note to the Iranian government requesting that measures be taken to protect the lives and property of British and Indian nationals in southern Iran. This demonstration of force by the British Navy is probably the result of this note. Once the Iranian government provides guarantees, the situation will ease, and the British cruisers will soon sail out of the Persian Gulf. In addition, a new batch of Iranian troops is heading to southern Iran. However, because the oil workers' strike in southern Iran has been resolved quickly, the British naval demonstration is probably meaningless.</p>
<p>London Statement Denies</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 20th] Rumors that three British cruisers were anchored off the port of Abadan, ready to take action if British interests in Iran were threatened, have been denied by British officials. They said that the British cruiser "Norfolk" entered the port of Abadan to refuel, and immediately sailed out of Iranian territorial waters after refueling.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, the newly appointed Ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wu Nanru, the newly appointed Chargé d'affaires to Poland, Bao Yi, and secretaries Zhou Shukai and Guo Changlu, departed by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane for Calcutta this morning at 10:00 amidst the rain, en route to Paris. Minister Wang, dressed in a brown suit and a purple-red tie, looking spirited, waved goodbye to those seeing him off in the rain before boarding the plane. It is expected that they will arrive in Calcutta at 10:30 PM tonight. Mr. Wang's trip will last approximately one month before he can return to China. During his absence, the duties of the ministry will be handled by Vice Ministers Gan and Liu, and the European Department will be temporarily headed by the newly appointed Counselor, Gong Chao. This is the second time Mr. Wang has personally represented China at an international conference since becoming the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before his departure, Mr. Wang made the following brief statement to the Central News Agency reporter: (1) The purpose of the Chinese government in participating in this peace conference is to promote its success. (2) Regardless of the source, China will support and implement all proposals at the peace conference that strengthen the foundation of lasting world peace. International justice is the main basis for lasting world peace. (3) Regarding international justice, various parties may have different interpretations, but all territorial disputes should be resolved according to the supreme principle of nationalism. This is indisputable. Anything contrary to this will be contrary to justice and harmful to peace. (4) The peace that the United Nations grants to its enemies must avoid all unnecessary and dangerous conditions. Otherwise, the day the peace treaty is signed will be the beginning of the revival of the enemy's reactionary forces, and its democratic and free forces will never be able to rise or develop.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The newly appointed Ambassador to the UK, Dr. Zheng Tianxi, left Beijing for the UK this morning with Foreign Minister Wang. After his departure, he told reporters: "I studied in England in my early years and lived there for ten years. Later, I served as a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for nine years, spending nearly twenty years in Europe altogether. I have many British friends. Therefore, I am very pleased to be appointed as ambassador to the UK. In 1935, the exhibition of Chinese Palace Museum artifacts in England was highly praised by friendly countries. At that time, I was in charge of the event in England and I deeply felt that both China and the UK are ancient civilizations, and cultural exchange can enhance understanding and mutual respect between the two countries." Mr. Zheng is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, is 62 years old, and holds a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>

The purpose of this purge in the Soviet Army is to demote commanders who are close to the Western Allies. Zhukov and Novikov both had close relations with the commanders of the Western Allied forces.

<h3 id="e37">Studying Future War Trends; Three Important Recommendations Proposed; Unify Command of Army, Navy, and Air Force; Controlling Air Superiority is the Key to Victory; Report by U.S. Experts Published <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, D.C., 20th] The White House today released the latest report of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. This report, drafted by civilian experts led by Deillier, is 30 pages long and pays extraordinary attention to air superiority in modern warfare throughout. Based on extensive surveys, it puts forward several recommendations, advocating that Congress pass a law to unify the U.S. armed forces under a single Department of Defense. In addition to the Army and Navy, there should be an equal Air Force responsible for both passive and active defense against foreign attacks, and for strategic attacks using airplanes or missiles. At the beginning of the Pacific War, the United States' strategic intelligence was far inferior to that of Germany and Japan, and research work was neglected. In the future, if intelligence is still lacking during a national crisis, it will inevitably lead to endless troubles. The current development of atomic bombing indicates that the basic principles of war remain unchanged, but atomic weapons will greatly change the scope of the use of manpower and armaments, leading to fundamental reforms in equipment, training, and tactics. The report also makes three recommendations: (1) Focus on research work to make the United States a world leader. The annual expenditure on research and development should reach $1 billion to ensure a reasonable level of national defense security. (2) Improve intelligence. The intelligence work of various agencies is currently irresponsible, and there is a severe shortage of capable intelligence personnel, which inevitably leads to panic and needs to be corrected urgently. (3) Maintain peace with armed forces. The United States is now one of the great powers and should be prepared to rise up to defend the law and fulfill its duties to guarantee treaty obligations. If the United States wants to become a force for maintaining peace, it must not only have this desire but also have this power.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 20th] The Turkish people are scheduled to elect 465 members of parliament tomorrow. This election is based on the Western democratic method and is unprecedented in Turkey. This employs universal suffrage and direct voting, and the opposition party can compete openly for the first time. The victory of the Republican People's Party, the government party, is expected. The most powerful opposition party, the Democratic Party, is participating in the election in 46 of the 63 provinces of Turkey, with a total of 273 candidates. In the remaining 17 provinces, the People's Party has no opponent. Recently, there have been news of conflicts in various places, and two people were killed near Aydin village.</p>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 20th] Turkey is holding elections tomorrow, and the situation is quite tense today, and there have been shootings, with at least four deaths. It is expected that the number of voters on Sunday will exceed ten million. Istanbul is still under martial law, and the army commander has issued a warning that disturbances will not be allowed to occur. According to reports, a police reserve force of 200 people has entered the Izmir district. In other nearby areas, three people were shot and killed. Istanbul and Izmir are the concentrated areas of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is led by Bayar. Since the government allowed the reorganization of opposition parties last December, political groups have sprung up, with the Democratic Party being the strongest. President Inönü said that in today's international situation, the whole world is in danger, and Turkey is particularly worrying. He asked the people to continue to support the government to ensure security.</p>
<h3 id="e44">India's Independence Movement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Since this war, only three major countries remain in Asia: China, the Soviet Union, and India. China and the Soviet Union are both independent and autonomous countries. In particular, this anti-aggression war has shattered the dream of the Axis powers, proving that the survival and independence of the two major Chinese and Soviet nations have achieved great success. However, India's independence issue, after years of struggle, remains to be realized. China and India live adjacent to each other, so we cannot but pay great attention to it.</p>
<p>India is located in the southwest of our country, with a population of nearly 400 million. It has an ancient culture, abundant resources, and a Mongolian race similar to ours. When our seaports were blocked one by one by the Japanese enemy, India became the gateway to our great rear area. Therefore, whether in peacetime or wartime, China and India have close relations with each other. Unfortunately, due to various obstacles and inconveniences, China still cannot deeply understand India, and India has no way of understanding the current China. After the end of the war, the wartime transportation between China and India immediately stopped, which further reduced our attention to the Indian issue, which is really not right!</p>
<p>From the current point of view, India's independence movement seems difficult to achieve perfect success for the time being. The ruling party in Britain now is the Labor Party, which claims to adhere to socialism. Since the Labor Party came to power last autumn, its face on the Indian issue is not much different from that of the Conservative Party government. Since Nehru and many other leaders of the Indian independence movement were released from prison last year, they have repeatedly stated that what the Indian nation seeks is independence, not autonomy, that is, to completely break away from the rule of the British Empire and not to become a part of the many dominions in the British Empire. However, the British Labor government still passes on the mantle of the Conservative Party, only allowing India to enjoy dominion-style freedom. No matter who or what group is sent to India for negotiations, after talking and talking, it still does not overflow the scope proposed by Sir Cripps on behalf of the British government in 1942. The British government's excessive emphasis on India, it is undeniable, makes India's independence not as simple and easy as that of the Philippines, while British newspapers say that the Philippines' independence is not as good as that of the British dominions.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internal situation in India is obviously quite divided now. India's independence movement over the years has been led by the National Congress Party. Unexpectedly, "since Yu was born, why was Liang born," Jinnah, who advocated the partition of India, has risen up and is in a stalemate with Gandhi and Nehru everywhere. As a result of the one positive and one negative forces canceling each other out, the Indian nation's struggle for independence has been greatly diminished. And just as the British cabinet's delegation to India had just returned to England, there was the so-called "untouchable group," which continued to make things difficult for the National Congress Party. Although India is a country, it has long been secretly divided into pieces in terms of race, religion, language, class, and customs, causing the flesh and blood to kill each other, and brothers to fight each other. In the same family, they have built high walls for others. Therefore, India's man-made inability to unite has become a major blow to India's independent future. A country whose sovereignty is violated by others is often also a country that is difficult to unite itself. Therefore, judging from the Reuters reports that have repeatedly publicized the news of the Indian untouchable group opposing the National Congress Party, it shows that India's independence movement will inevitably have to pay a considerable price.</p>
<p>However, freedom and independence, India's 400 million people, will eventually get it sooner or later. First, the Indian nation has a profound and subtle culture, which has awakened every Indian to the need for their country to gain freedom and independence. As long as the Indian nation itself feels an urgent need, it will inevitably achieve its goal. Second, in the independence movement, India's leaders are much stronger and more numerous than those of other oppressed countries in Asia, such as Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. Burma still cannot find a leader today who can lead the country internally and has international status externally; while India has countless leaders in addition to Gandhi, Nehru, Acharya, and Mrs. Pandit. India has such great leaders, just as China had the leadership of the Father of the Nation when overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, and the leadership of the Chairman when eliminating the warlords and resisting the Japanese invaders. There is no doubt that India's independence will definitely be successful sooner or later. Third, any country now expresses deep hope and sympathy for India's independence movement. From the United States to China, the Soviet Union, and other countries, they have made clear expressions, earnestly hoping that India's 400 million people can get rid of their shackles as soon as possible and jointly shoulder the great task of building a road to peace for this troubled world. Fourth, as far as Britain is concerned, the Indian nation has made a long and great contribution to Britain. Especially in the First and Second World Wars, the Indian nation has shed a lot of blood. When the British cabinet delegation to India reported to the House of Commons and the House of Lords on the 18th of this month on the negotiations with the Indian leaders, it stated that Britain was sincere in making India an independent and autonomous country as soon as possible. This attitude is very proper, and it is hoped that Britain will no longer make any additional conditions and fulfill its promise in the Far East, just like the United States did to the Philippines. In summary of the above four points, we feel that the future of India's independence has shown that it will have strong brightness.</p>
<p>Once India's independence is completed, it can be said that half of the overall situation of world peace has been built, because before the slave nations in Asia and Africa have gained freedom and liberation, all peace and security in the world are empty, and are no different from building on sand.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The Foreign Office announced today that Britain has lodged a note with Egypt, which is very strong, protesting the continued attacks on British soldiers. Although the British government is aware that this hostile action is instigated by those who wish to see relations between the two countries deteriorate, it is also concerned about how the Egyptian government is dealing with this intolerable situation. The British side believes that the Egyptian government has not taken the methods it should and could take to protect the lives of British soldiers. The former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, fled from France and is now under the protection of the Egyptian royal family in Alexandria. The British government has also expressed concern that the Egyptian government has not guaranteed to prevent his political activities. The talks between the British Ambassador to Egypt, Campbell, and the Egyptian government have not yet been completed. If Husseini stays in Egypt for a long time, the situation will be very unsatisfactory. According to unofficial statements from the Foreign Office, no matter what guarantees Egypt makes, London does not believe that Husseini will cooperate with Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e52">"One of the Elders" Attracts Much Attention; Hearing of Wen Lanting Postponed; Originally Scheduled for Today Due to Family Request for Delay; Lawyers Including Zhu Fu-jiu Reportedly Retained to Prepare Defense <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wen Lanting, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," after being prosecuted by the High Procuratorate, was originally scheduled to have his first hearing at the High Court at 3 PM today. Many in the city are concerned about the Wen case, and it is expected that the courtroom would be filled with spectators on the day of the hearing. However, according to reliable sources, the case has been postponed with the approval of the High Court due to a request from the defendant's lawyers and family for a delay in the trial.</p>
<p>Wen Lanting is 76 years old and from Jiangsu Province. He was involved in the cotton yarn business in Shanghai in his early years and has served as a director of the Yarn Industry Association, chairman of the Exchange Federation, executive member of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, standing committee member of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and executive member of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation. He was indeed a highly respected figure in the business world. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Wen successively served as chairman and director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, chairman of the puppet Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the puppet Cotton Control Association, member of the puppet Material Control Review Committee, and member of the puppet Municipal Advisory Committee. In the cotton yarn industry, he also served as chairman of the Yarn Factory Federation, chairman of the Yarn Industry Guild, chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and chairman of the Yarn Industry Bank. After the victory, Wen, along with the other "Two Elders," Yuan Ludeng and Lin Kanghou, was arrested by military authorities and sent to judicial authorities for trial and detained in Zhongzi Prison of Shanghai Prison for several months.</p>
<p>The life sentences handed down to Yuan Ludeng and Tang Shoumin greatly shocked Wen. During the High Procuratorate's investigation, he once refused to leave prison for questioning. Yuan was the director of the "Rice Control Association" under the "Commercial Control Association" at the time, and Tang was the chairman of the "Commercial Control Association" when Wen served as chairman. Now that Yuan and Tang have both been sentenced to life imprisonment, Wen anticipates at least a life sentence for himself, hence the saying, "The trial will be the same either way, so a quick verdict is better, why bother with more trials?" Currently, Wen's family has retained lawyers including Zhu Fu-jiu to prepare his defense. Although the date of the trial has been postponed, it will not be in the distant future.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] More than 140 temporary employees of the Municipal Postal Administration recently requested the Bureau to promote them to formal postal workers, postal assistants, and postmen. It is understood that the Bureau may not be able to approve this request in the short term, but the employees are trying their best to fight for it. A responsible person from the Bureau stated during an interview that, considering the current business situation of the Shanghai Post Office, even with the successive arrival of personnel from the rear, temporary employees will not be affected and laid off. At the same time, they have become quite familiar with the Bureau's operations after working for several months, so they will not be dismissed unless absolutely necessary. As for the salary, since the General Bureau has never approved the addition of permanent staff, it is already a special consideration to allow all temporary employees who pass the examination to join the Bureau as soon as possible. A "temporary" postman complained that their salary is about half that of a permanent postman, while their work is exactly the same. It is understood that the employees have formed a New Comrades Affairs Committee and plan to send five representatives to negotiate with the Bureau again today, and also entrust the General Labor Union to request the General Bureau to assist.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the staff of this newspaper held their second social garden party at the Shanghai branch of the Qingnian Tuan (Youth Corps) on Jin Shenfu Road. At that time, the setting sun was descending, and the evening breeze was gently blowing. The garden lawn of the corps was filled with women, and the atmosphere was cheerful. The entertainment program included the Pan Yuzhen siblings' skills troupe, performing various thrilling national arts such as diabolo, and Deng Wenqing performing magic and hypnosis. A dinner was held around 7 PM, during which Ms. Jun Yiyun, a famous Kunqu opera singer who is about to go to Beijing to perform, and famous amateur performers Mao Jinfang, Mao Yinfang, Zhu Min, Wu Husheng, and Fan Shiren sang. (Famous Qin performers Wang Ruoqi and Zhou Dongming played the instruments). After the meal, Mrs. Hou Guohua and her sister Miss Qiu played Hawaiian music, adding a lot of color to the event.

<h3 id="e61">Dr. Li Zhaohuan Discusses His Impressions After Returning from Abroad; British Still Living Wartime Lives; United States Abandoning Isolationist Policy <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Li Zhaohuan, chairman of the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth, and Liang Xiaochu, the general secretary of the Association, flew to Switzerland at the end of February this year to represent the Association at the World Youth Conference. After the conference, they traveled through Britain and went to the United States to attend the North American Youth Conference. They recently returned to China, and a reporter from this newspaper visited his residence to inquire about his impressions of the trip.</p>
<p>Li said that the most profound impression of this trip was the fighting spirit of the British. He said that everyone in the UK, from the King down, is willing to sacrifice. Although the war has been over for a long time, because everything in the country has not yet recovered, the people are still living wartime lives, as if the war has not ended. The various controls that were implemented during the war still exist, so there is no black market in Britain.</p>
<p>[Photo of Li Zhao Huan, taken by Gu Tingpeng]</p>
<p>After this war, the British deeply felt that the world trend had changed. Therefore, national governance and foreign policy have been adjusted. For example, many old friends in the UK believe that the so-called imperialism of the past is over. The current British government is a labor government, and unless there are unexpected twists and turns, the current government is expected to continue in power until 1950.</p>
<p>At this point, Li quoted the two major schools of sociology promoted in modern times: one is the environmental school, and the other is the heredity school. From the impressions of this trip, he deeply felt that the world trend has a tendency towards the environmental school. For example, the countries he visited on this trip, Britain, Switzerland, and the United States, have all abandoned their previous traditional policies, and all their policies are focused on adapting to the environment.</p>
<p>In the case of the United States, in terms of diplomacy, it has changed from its past traditional isolationist policy to adapting to the environment. After this war, Americans have deeply understood that in order to seek their own security, the collective security of the world must also be taken into account. Therefore, they are studying how to cooperate and help each other with the world and lead the world into a state of peace.</p>
<p>In terms of domestic affairs, the United States has gradually moved towards centralization in order to adapt to the environment. According to the United States, before the Civil War, it adopted a system of local decentralization. The North-South War was actually a turning point in centralization. Even at that time, there were still many people who opposed centralization. After President Roosevelt advocated it and was affected by the war, centralization became popular. For example: (1) Each province and city built airports. If the province and city could not afford the construction costs, they could apply for subsidies from the central government. (2) People's welfare undertakings were previously handled by each province and city, but in the past ten years, they have gradually been centralized and handled by the central government. (3) Labor issues were also previously handled by each province and city, but recently the central government has established a Department of Labor. Important labor issues are concentrated in the central government.</p>
<p>Dr. Li is 58 years old, from Nanhai, Guangdong. He studied in the United States in his early years and served as the president of National Jiaotong University for many years. In addition to being responsible for the affairs of the National Association of Youth, his main position is as a member of the Legislative Yuan. He is currently working hard to assist Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, in preparing for the reopening of the National Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Refugees Encouraged After Recovery of Taixing and Other Places; Difficulties Remain for Return; Relief Work Cannot Be Relaxed <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Many homeless refugees from Guanfu, Rugao, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have flowed into major ports along the Beijing-Shanghai line. Yesterday, a gentleman from the Guanfu Refugee Youth Group told a reporter that as of Saturday, the number of people transferring from Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other inland areas to this city was increasing daily. These refugees not only faced difficulties in food and drink relief, but also mostly slept in the open at night due to the lack of housing, which was very miserable. However, since yesterday, the situation has suddenly changed. Not only has the number of people coming to Shanghai suddenly decreased, but those who have already arrived in Shanghai have also flocked to the various associations of their respective communities in northern Jiangsu to inquire whether they can return home immediately. This is because the news of the recovery of Taixing, Rugao, and other places has reached this city. All the refugees were overjoyed and believed that their long-separated hometowns could be restored. However, in the above-mentioned areas, in addition to the refugee groups who are following the National Army's advance, or may have already seen their hometowns again, the number of refugees in Beijing and Shanghai is large, and even if they can return home, the supply of transportation is also a major problem. Therefore, although the refugees all hate not being able to fly back, in reality there are still difficulties. Therefore, relief work still cannot be relaxed in the slightest.</p>
<p>Midnight Charity Dance Postponed</p>
<p>The Hongkou Dance Hall Friendship Association, jointly formed by the employees of the Hongkou Xinsheng Club, Guohua, Kaifu, Nightclub, and Haili, was originally scheduled to hold a midnight charity dance and bazaar on the 20th from 12 PM to 5 AM the next morning to raise donations for the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu. All proceeds will be used to relieve refugees in northern Jiangsu, and all expenses will be shared by the members of the Association. However, as this initiative has not been approved by the local Bureau, it has been decided to reschedule it for this Saturday (26th).</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government has submitted a request to the government authorities to tighten the staffing of the Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus and affiliated agencies, and to reduce personnel, in order to balance revenue and expenditure due to the large deficit in Shanghai's fiscal revenue for this year and the large amount of various expenses. In the future, the number of retained personnel will be based on the combined number of employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Government and the former two concession authorities in the summer of 1937. As for the newly established institutions after the war, they will also be adjusted as needed. The relevant authorities have approved the above measures for implementation soon.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Memorial Service for Martyr Yin Dantian <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Martyr Yin Dantian devoted himself to the work of resisting the enemy behind enemy lines during the war and died in battle on June 15, 1945, in Zhoujing Village, Bijing Township, Qingpu County. People from all walks of life held a memorial service at Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai yesterday morning at 10 AM. Participants included people from the municipal Party headquarters, all walks of life in Qingpu County, and friends of the martyr. The hall was solemnly decorated. Wu Shaoshu (representing Jiang Huaisu) presided over the ceremony. After offering incense, dedicating lanterns, and presenting flowers, the guests successively delivered speeches praising the martyr's deeds during his lifetime. The meeting adjourned after about an hour. Also, in order to commemorate Martyr Gu, people from all walks of life have established the Municipal Dantian Primary School on Hongqiao Road as a permanent remembrance. Before the war, the martyr's family was wealthy. During the war, he destroyed his family to join the army, and his family property was completely lost. After the martyr's death, he left behind a widow and young daughter, and only received a consolation payment of 30,000 yuan from his superiors. Their livelihood depended entirely on subsidies from the martyr's friends during his lifetime. The situation is very pitiful. The memorial meeting yesterday discussed jointly raising funds for the family to comfort the loyal soul.</p>
<p>Madam Zou, Mother of Qian; Second Anniversary of Death Yesterday</p>
<p>Madam Zou, the mother of Ms. Qian Jianqiu, director of the Municipal Women's Association, member of the Municipal Party Committee, and counselor of the Municipal Government, and the grandmother of Qian Ying, the section chief of the Land Administration Bureau, passed away two years ago. At that time, Qian was engaged in underground work, and the son-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law of Madam were arrested and detained in the Japanese Military Police Department. Madam was particularly indignant and left a will that she would not hold a funeral until the final victory was won. Yesterday was the second anniversary of Madam's death, and Ms. Qian specifically spent the entire day chanting scriptures at the Jade Buddha Temple to express her filial piety. Party, League, government, and military leaders Zhang Zhiben, Wu Shaoshu, Yu Songjun, Shen Chunhui, Chen Shihua, and hundreds of leaders of various women's organizations came to pay their respects.</p>
<h3 id="e66">China Fisheries Company Opens Railway Refrigeration Business <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the hot weather, being in a hurry to visit the railway refrigeration business opened by the China Fisheries Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry seems fresh! The theme is also timely.</p>
<p>According to the China Fisheries Company, they opened the railway refrigeration business this time in order to relieve the food panic and suppress the market prices of aquatic products and agricultural products. Therefore, they leased four refrigerated trains from the Jinpu Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, preparing to travel back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Jinpu lines, specializing in transporting various frozen fish, fresh meat and eggs, and agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>At 4:50 PM the day before yesterday, one of the refrigerated cars making its first trip was attached to the fourth-class train departing from the North Station to Nanjing. When the reporter arrived at the North Station, the refrigerated car, fully equipped and ready to go, was being connected by the locomotive to other trains.</p>
<p>The outline of the refrigerated car is no different from that of an ordinary iron-covered car. However, it is painted a light gray color, which is a little better than the ugly iron-covered car. The maiden voyage was loaded with a batch of yellow croaker from the Fisheries Company. Therefore, when the car door was opened, although a cool breeze was sent, it was filled with a fishy smell!</p>
<p>The interior of the car is lined with wool felt up to eight inches thick on all four walls to insulate it from the outside heat. The top of the car is fully equipped with layered ice troughs, with more than three tons of ice installed. Although the space left in the car is not very large, it is said that it can also hold more than ten tons of fresh goods.</p>
<p>During the trial period, it is limited to one round trip on the Beijing-Shanghai line every day, with one car attached each time, and loading is limited to direct loading between Shanghai and Nanjing, and small stations along the way will not accept goods for the time being. If it is handled well, it will gradually be promoted to other routes and small stations, and the ultimate goal is to achieve universal service.</p>
<p>At present, the China Fisheries Company's rent burden to the Jinpu Railway Bureau is 960 yuan per ton per day. The load of each car is twelve tons, so the daily rental expense for each car is 11,520 yuan. And if the customer has fresh goods to load, they only need to add 30% to the freight stipulated by the original Railway Bureau, then your fresh goods, even on the busy, hot, and long Beijing-Shanghai road, can always maintain its freshness.</p>
<p>When leaving the North Station, the reporter found a train at the end of the fourth-class passenger train loaded with two rubber-wheeled US military refrigerated trailers. A person in the refrigeration industry unconsciously pointed out: This is a truly standard refrigerated car, because it uses ammonia compression to generate cold air. Our refrigerated car is inevitably dwarfed in comparison. However, the reporter believes otherwise. At present, although we cannot keep up with the novelty of others in terms of materials, the spirit of grasping reality and catching up should be strived for. The China Fisheries Company's opening of the railway refrigeration business this time has at least demonstrated part of this spirit. The reporter believes that in the near future, the real refrigerated car will run on all Chinese railways with the continuous expression of this spirit!</p>

<p>In this city, it's often heard that there are always thugs who use swapping methods to deceive ignorant villagers. These people are nimble, and once discovered, they quickly vanish, making it difficult to catch them. On the 20th of this month at 9:30 AM, Cao Guo'an (15 years old), an apprentice at Tong Chang Hua Foreign Goods Store at No. 100 Jinling Road, was ordered by the shop owner to deposit 610,000 yuan in legal tender into a cloth bag and send it to Mao Hua Bank on Henan Road. When Cao Guo'an was walking along Fuzhou Road towards Fujian Road, two men suddenly approached him from behind (one dressed in a white Hong Kong shirt and trousers, around 30 years old; the other in a yellow Hong Kong shirt and yellow shorts, also around 30 years old). They spoke with a northern accent, claiming to have lost a package of US dollar notes on the way, and asked Cao Guo'an if he had picked them up. Cao Guo'an, being young and inexperienced, unaware of the dangers of the world, immediately stated that he had not found anything and opened the cloth bag, allowing the two men to examine it. The two men rummaged through his bag for a while and then left. After they left, Cao discovered that 215,000 yuan of legal tender in the bag, including two bundles, had completely turned into counterfeit money. Only then did he realize he had been scammed and reported it to the responsible police station for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Visiting the Infant Health Care Center: A Mother's Luck, an Infant's Blessing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>In countries like the United States and the Soviet Union, for pre-school education and healthcare, from the moment an infant is born until they enter kindergarten, the state universally establishes infant health care centers to take on the work of education, upbringing, health, and medical care. What about in our country? There is no shortage of infant care organizations in various places, such as nurseries and orphanages, but unfortunately, most of them are poorly equipped, with dilapidated buildings, and various environments that are not suitable for the lives and health of infants. The infants sent there are left to grow naturally, with no effort to care for their health. In fact, they cannot properly fulfill their health care responsibilities. Therefore, it is simply impossible for salaried civil servants and working women to solve the problem of child care and health. Under these circumstances, countless infants are sacrificed every year. Even women who are eager to create a better future for children and want to solve this difficulty lack the courage to work hard due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Recently, the reporter had the opportunity to visit the Shanghai Infant Health Care Center at No. 10, Lane 173, Dongbaoxing Road, North Sichuan Road. It is a newly renovated three-story modern Western-style house. When the reporter ran in, it happened that a foster child was being admitted. Two young ladies in white uniforms were examining the child lying on a white rectangular table, one was a female doctor with a stethoscope, and the other was a female nurse. Miss Liang, who was sitting at a writing desk for four people, greeted me very kindly. The reporter quickly took out a business card and explained my purpose. Under the diligent guidance of Miss Liang, the reporter went upstairs to meet Miss Yun Boqin, the director of the hospital, for the first time. Director Yun is a kind and approachable woman. Judging from her elegant demeanor and generous attitude, she is indeed a capable female leader.</p>
<p>When Director Yun met me, this "uninvited guest," she said very modestly, "We really can't handle fostering children in this place! So we are actively requesting the allocation of housing." Then the reporter asked her about the motivation for founding the hospital.</p>
<p>"My motivation for founding the health care center was also because I was originally a working woman. In order to serve society and focus on my duties, in order to take care of my child, I left my child in the hands of a servant who had no medical knowledge. My eldest child was raised by a wet nurse. As the saying goes, 'Breastfeeding is like three points,' and my eldest child's temper is just like the wet nurse's. All kinds of bad habits cannot be corrected even now that she is seven years old."</p>
<p>"For the second child, I decided to breastfeed myself, but because I didn't have much milk, the child was too thin. I had no choice but to hire a wet nurse again. The young wet nurse wouldn't listen to me and secretly let the child eat too many indigestible things. The weather was hot, and she lost her life to dysentery before we could detect it and treat her."</p>
<p>"This January, because I was busy with my work, my fourth child also died due to the misuse of medication by the servants and doctors at the public hospital," she said very sadly.</p>
<p>"I think that such an experience is not only the misfortune of the child, but also the misfortune of the country, especially the children of working women and civil servants. The pain is even deeper. On the one hand, in order to supplement the family income, they have to help their husbands find a job. On the other hand, they are reluctant to leave their children at home unattended or are unwilling to entrust them to servants. At the same time, there is no suitable place to entrust them. Therefore, I made up my mind. But doing one thing is not easy. These children have grown up so easily, all thanks to these children's nurses and the two enthusiastic doctors who take turns caring for them day and night." As she spoke, she asked the on-duty nurse to take a white disinfected isolation gown and mask and asked me to put them on. She herself also went back to the room to change into an isolation gown and mask before inviting the reporter to enter the first health care room for a visit.</p>
<p>The entire room was filled with small wooden beds covered in cream-colored new-style versatile, each bed sleeping an infant. Four beds were grouped together, and each group was cared for by a young lady in a white uniform who was a children's nurse. Changing diapers and feeding milk, they worked hard for the children as if they were mothers. However, every younger nurse was gentle and lively. The reporter subconsciously thought of her own childhood and couldn't help but feel sad. If there had been a health care center at that time, a child without a mother would never have suffered from the abuse of cruel and ignorant servants, which prevented her from achieving normal physical and mental development, thereby affecting her health.</p>
<p>After the reporter left the health care room, she asked Director Yun about future plans. She told me in detail as follows:</p>
<p>"Our hospital is still in its early stages of operation. The only job is to lay a solid foundation first." She applied to the relevant authorities for the allocation of housing. In short, this is a social enterprise, not something that belongs to an individual. However, I hope that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and assistance."</p>
<p>The reporter looked at the time and it was getting late, so she said goodbye and left. In addition to deeply admiring Director Yun's spirit of service in solving problems for everyone because she felt the pain herself, she also silently prayed for the eternal life of the Infant Health Care Center. This is truly the luck of the mothers and the blessing of the infants in Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Reported from Hangzhou by this newspaper] Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Honglie, in a recent provincial administrative meeting, discussed the issue of future education. He said, "At the current stage, it seems that improving quality should be the main focus. The foundation of education in this province was unfortunately mostly destroyed during the war. Not only are school buildings insufficient and equipment lacking, but teachers are also mostly on the brink of starvation, making it difficult for them to concentrate on their work. The lack of primary school teachers is a particularly common phenomenon. In the future, secondary education in each county should be enriched according to the available funds. In the area of national education, salaries must be standardized and funding institutionalized, taken from the villages and used for the villages, to avoid burdening the people and the schools being in constant fear. This matter relies heavily on the assistance of public opinion institutions to adapt to local conditions."</p>

<p>The District Office is Actively Preparing for Establishment</p>
<p>The 13th District of this city (Putuo District) is an industrial area with low cultural standards, and illiteracy accounts for more than 70% of the district's population. In view of this, the District Office plans to actively establish people's schools in the district, with an estimated six schools. The key points of the planning are excerpted below: (1) Teachers: It is planned to invite graduates from the Shanghai Municipal Social Education Personnel Training Class, outstanding local autonomous workers in the district, and intellectuals who are experienced and interested in serving as teachers. (2) School Sites: Personnel have been dispatched to contact and borrow sites separately. (3) Funding: It is planned to invite local gentry, educators, and Baojia personnel to jointly raise funds.</p>

<p>Madam Sun Hopes to Promote a Nationwide Movement</p>
<p>The China Welfare Fund, organized by Madam Sun, recently announced that poor children in Shanghai will have a free library. Two locations have been selected for libraries, with reading rooms and writing rooms. Students from middle schools and colleges in Shanghai have launched fundraising efforts to raise funds for the establishment of the library. The Children's Library will be jointly organized by the China Welfare Fund and the schools promoting the "Little Teacher Movement." Little teachers will teach reading and writing to children who have never had the opportunity to learn. Madam Sun hopes that the children's library, first established as two branches, will be the beginning of a nationwide movement. Currently, the demand for establishing free libraries is extremely urgent. Once this type of library is widely established, China's illiteracy rate will inevitably decrease sharply. The purpose of the plan to establish this type of library is also in this. Madam Sun said: "We should develop the habit of reading among poor children. To achieve this goal, we should collect books for them. The China Welfare Fund specially continues to request enthusiastic support from all parties."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Autumn Book Shortage Needs Remedying; Joint Sales Method Still Shelved <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing] The current Seven-Organization Joint Office has successively obtained approval from the Ministry of Education to establish supply groups in various places for the supply of nationally designated textbooks, and implement the "unified sales" method. However, in order to take into account the interests of the vendors and the difficulties of each county and school in self-determined purchases, the unified sales method was slightly revised to "joint sales." However, it has been a month since the principles and key points were decided, and the implementation measures have not yet been drafted and passed, and the printing progress is also very slow. Now that the start of the autumn semester is fast approaching, the nationally designated textbooks will again be concentrated in a few cities for sale under the slogan of "too late," and there is still a tendency for book shortages in various places. The Board of Directors of the Seven-Organization Joint Office will convene an emergency meeting in the coming days to discuss remedial measures. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is quite anxious after receiving the news and will send personnel to Shanghai to supervise the work.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Tight Credit Leads to Hoarders Selling; Rice Price Lower Than Limit Price; Grain Examination Committee to Meet Today to Discuss <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Grain Price Review Committee, which has been suspended for five days, is scheduled to reconvene at 3 PM today to have important discussions. The arrival of rice yesterday was still low, so prices continued to fall. According to a survey, the retail price of top-quality white rice is only 67,000 to 68,000, which is 3,000 yuan lower than the review price of 71,000. Grain rice is even cheaper, only 47,000 yuan. However, actual sales are sluggish and few people are interested. The current inventory is still sufficient. In addition to the market supply, the daily inventory is about 30,000 Shih, and there are still 150,000 bags of foreign rice in the warehouse that have not been used. Last week, the China Grain Corporation had 110,000 bags arrive at the port, and it is said that 200,000 bags are expected to arrive continuously within the month, so the period of shortage can be safely passed. Whether the review price will be reduced will depend on today's market price and supply and demand.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, the rice price in this city has tended to stabilize, and the source of rice from various places has increased greatly. Yesterday, a total of more than 12,000 bags of rice were transported to Shanghai from various production areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, and Wuhu, breaking the recent record. It is learned that the reasons are as follows: (1) Credit in various rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, and Wuhu has been very tight recently, and local money houses have tightened lending, so rice merchants have come out of hiding. (2) A large amount of foreign rice is arriving one after another, and hoarders are anxious to sell. (3) The autumn harvest is approaching, and new grains will be available soon.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The rice price in this city has fallen. In addition to a small part of the lower-middle class buying brown rice, most people buy white rice. The sales of roasted rice are becoming increasingly sluggish. It is learned that more than 60 rice stores are reporting that the sales of brown rice are sluggish and the source of white rice is gradually becoming smooth. They have specifically sent a letter to the Rice Store Industry Association to submit to the Social Bureau, requesting that the brown rice received by the rice stores cannot be sold out and requesting appropriate measures to avoid unexpected losses.</p>

<p>Recently, the grey cloth market has been improving due to the shortage of raw materials and the insufficient supply from the Textile Construction Company. At the same time, there is demand from dyeing factories and customers. The grey cloth market has been making slow progress. Customers from Shilin Cloth, Xi'an, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Changsha, and other places have been gradually starting to purchase, and the dyeing workers have also increased, so the market has been raised. Serges are being dumped due to floating prices. Although customers are willing to accept them, the market is still flat. However, the chemical cloth market is gradually declining due to the seasonal impact.</p>

<p>[Tianjin Telegraph] Due to the severe credit crunch in this city recently, the market has been unable to recover. Most speculators have liquidated their goods in order to lend funds and seek high profits. The nominal highest interest rate is no more than 18%, but the black market is above 20%, and interest is calculated weekly. Interest is compounded after the weekend. If the amount of the loan is large, the accumulated amount is very considerable. Currently, the atmosphere for cracking down on black banks and money houses is very strong. Those engaged in this business mostly use shop names and deduct interest in advance when lending funds, and debtors issue post-dated checks in order to avoid responsibility. It is reported that the competent authorities are paying attention to cracking down on this trend of black banks and money houses.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Petition to the Takeover Investigation Team; Request for Return of Robbed Cloth; Legal Reasons Presented <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The case of the members of the three associations of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn in this city requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes has long been noticed by the legal and public opinion circles. Recently, it was learned that the takeover investigation team has arrived in Shanghai to investigate the takeover of enemy and puppet properties. Various industries have suffered severely from the enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth. To this day, their vitality has not recovered, and their business is sluggish. It is also heard that knitting manufacturers, affected by the purchase of cotton yarn, are short of funds and unable to operate. They have jointly submitted a request to dedicate the factory. It can be seen that the industrial crisis is fraught with dangers and the situation is extremely urgent. In terms of the dyeing, weaving, and cotton yarn industries that were most affected by the enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth, about half have not yet recovered. Those that have resumed operations and then stopped have also emerged one after another. Those who勉維maintain the status quo also show signs of wavering. Currently, although the government is implementing industrial loans, very few dyeing and weaving industries have obtained them. The various industry associations have recently held meetings to discuss the increasingly serious situation and believe that the urgent solution is to request the government to implement industrial loans widely to alleviate the current crisis. However, the robbed yarn and cloth originally belonged to the factory numbers and should be returned as soon as possible to restore vitality. Therefore, returning the robbed yarn and cloth is an important step in rescuing industry and commerce. On the occasion of the arrival of the investigation team to Shanghai to investigate, a petition is being made to the team regarding the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau's forced mixing of privately owned yarn and cloth with enemy and puppet properties. According to inquiries from the industry, it was reported that the association had filed an appeal to the Executive Yuan regarding the request for the return of the robbed yarn and cloth. It is now heard that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Disposal Bureau to make a detailed reply. Legally speaking, the Bureau may make a legitimate handling again. However, this yarn and cloth has been sold in batches by the Disposal Bureau, which has caused great indignation among the industry, and there were original plans to launch a petition. Now, a petition is being filed with the investigation team in accordance with the law to investigate and protect rights and interests. Furthermore, the legal points of the petition submitted by the association are excerpted below: "According to Article 92, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, a declaration of intent made under duress can be revoked. The victims and the association have repeatedly requested the authorities to return the items, which can be considered as an expression of revocation. Moreover, property rights have the right of pursuit and are rights against the world. The enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth is no different from theft and robbery. And the stolen goods are recovered by the government. There is no doubt that it should be handed over to the original owner for collection. Furthermore, the Cairo Allied Declaration clearly states that any act of looting or robbery, whether formal or seemingly legal or close to a transaction voluntarily entered into by the parties, is invalid. According to Article 4, paragraph 1 of the principles for handling enemy properties promulgated by the Executive Yuan, it should also be returned to the original owner." It was also stated that: "The case was previously approved for return by the legal advisory committee of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau. The revocation of the previous and subsequent measures by the deliberation meeting of the Bureau is indeed incomprehensible."</p>

<p>Costing 46,000 Yuan per Dan, Import Tax Still Under Application</p>
<p>News of the import of foreign sugar into this city has already been reported. It is now known that some sugar merchants are placing orders with Cuba, Batavia, and other places. Currently, one or two batches, totaling 44,000 bags, have been ordered, with delivery scheduled for next month. The price of this foreign sugar is US$0.1875 per pound, equivalent to approximately 46,000 yuan per dan in national currency. However, the import tax rate for this sugar is still a problem. The Sugar Industry Association is currently requesting the customs authorities to levy tax as a necessity. If the customs authorities levy tax at the luxury goods import tax rate, the cost to sugar merchants will increase, making it difficult to make substantial profits.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Withered Slender West Lake <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Yangzhou Dispatch on the 5th, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>Among the lakes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suitable for sightseeing, the first is undoubtedly West Lake, with its famous "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" scenic spot, described as "mountains beyond mountains, towers beyond towers." The second is Xuanwu Lake, framed and highlighted by the magnificent Stone City and the towering Zhongshan Mountain, filled with lotus flowers. The third should be the Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, characterized by its "slenderness."</p>
<p>Poetic Relics</p>
<p>To digress: originally, Yangzhou's prosperity was famous throughout history. At one time, its flourishing might have surpassed the "Six Dynasties of Jinling." This can be seen from the city's construction. Yangzhou was one of the nine provinces. During the Zhou and Han dynasties, present-day Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places were all under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou. Even during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Yangzhou still governed eight counties, including Jiangdu, Ganquan, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixing, and Dongtai. The flourishing relics of the past are described in detail by Li Aitang of the Qing Dynasty in his "Yangzhou Shufanglu," stating that "Yangzhou merchants became rich through trade, and almost every family had gardens and pavilions. During Emperor Gaozong's southern inspection tours, many additions and decorations were made, and there were also mountain people, men of letters, painters, and skilled craftsmen embellishing the place, reaching a peak of prosperity at that time." Therefore, it is no wonder that in the poems of past generations, there are phrases praising Yangzhou such as "ten thousand strings of cash around the waist, riding a crane to Yangzhou" and "three parts of the moonlight in the sky, two parts of the charm belong to Yangzhou." There are also descriptions of the abundance of flowers and plants in Yangzhou. Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty wrote the line "descending to Yangzhou in the third month of smoky flowers," and Zheng Fan of the Qing Dynasty wrote the line "planting flowers for ten li is considered farming." Today's scenery on the Slender West Lake further proves that Tang Dynasty's Du Mu's line "on the night of the twenty-fourth bridge with the bright moon, where does the jade maiden teach the flute?" It can be imagined that it is only a remnant of the glorious past.</p>
<p>Northern Belles</p>
<p>What is the scenery like on today's Slender West Lake? This reporter believes that the Slender West Lake is beautiful, tranquil, and has a hint of charm - like an elegant and graceful Northern belle.</p>
<p>Although, after the impact of the war, this "Northern belle" born in the ancient Guangling of Huaian has some signs of weariness on her face. Many places show signs of decline and desolation. But this refers to some man-made buildings. As for the natural lake scenery, like "the Rainbow Bridge," like "the overlapping green of ten thousand pines," like the eternally beautiful and clear lake water - it is still worth lingering for visitors.</p>
<p>Distant View of the White Pagoda, one of the scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, photographed by Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>The lake is located in the northern suburbs of the county seat, with a winding surface of five li, with many winding paths and varying widths. The widest point is about one li. Precisely because of the many winding paths, the flat boat rippling through it makes visitors feel the wonder of "the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright and there is another village." The scenic spots on the lake include Luyang Village, Little Jinshan, Xu Garden, Five Pavilion Bridge, Lianxing Temple, Xiong Garden (Revolutionary Martyr Neng Chengji Memorial Park), Changdi, the former site of the Twenty-Four Bridges, and at the end of the lake, the Pingshan Hall, which houses the Fifth Spring under Heaven and Ouyang Xiu's calligraphy.</p>
<p>Small Tour by Boat</p>
<p>This afternoon, the weather was clearing up after days of continuous rain. Because this reporter had been separated from the "Northern belle" for many years, I took the opportunity to take a tour to comfort myself and her as well. The Old North Gate was closed due to the situation. We came out of the Tianning Gate and had tea at the Xiangying Gallery Tea House on "Lower Street." This place is very elegant. The house is next to the water, outside the railing, green willows swaying into the shade. Facing these swaying green willows, the ancient city wall covers half of the blue sky. The yellow walls of Tianning Temple on the east end, and the archway full of classical flavor, and the tour boat wharf, reflect the scenery here, inspiring poetic and picturesque feelings.</p>
<p>A tour boat into the lake, from Xiangying Gallery to the Five Pavilion Bridge and back, was negotiated for only 1,500 yuan. After sitting on it, a hawker selling sweets, melon seeds, and peanuts stepped onto the bow to solicit business. I bought 1,000 yuan worth of his goods.</p>
<p>The tour boat passed through the "Questioning the Moon Bridge" and crossed Luyang Village. I almost did not recognize this village, which was so beautiful in the past. The luxuriant trees and secluded views that were once there are almost gone. The boatman said that they were all cut down during the war.</p>
<p>The tour boat approached "Quyuan." Here, the azure sky affixed a row of towering pine trees like silhouettes to the beautiful sky. Looking from afar as other returning tour boats slowly approached under the rows of pine trees, and hearing the murmuring music of the boat head stirring up in my ears, the boat left in silence, and the sky and earth were silent.</p>
<p>However, passing through the Great Rainbow Bridge, one thing made me feel lost. On the west bank of the lake, the weeping willows on the Changdi that used to make me drunk are gone. Although the four-corner pavilion on the waist of the embankment still exists, I always feel that it cannot save the established defect. On the south bank of the embankment, the building of Xiong Garden can be seen to be broken down from afar!</p>
<p>Boating in the Middle Stream</p>
<p>Arriving at Little Jinshan (the mountain in the middle of the lake), I took a brief tour and saw it for a week. Buildings such as the "Lakeside Thatched Cottage" seemed to have been repaired, maintaining a lot of scenery. Then I climbed to the "Wind Pavilion" on the top of the mountain, and looked out at the lake and mountains, taking in everything. The Five Pavilion Bridge and the White Pagoda, and the "Wind Pavilion" are in corner positions, surrounded by smoky trees in front, behind, left and right. The wind blows the trees, and occasionally, the wind sends up the laughter of the boatmen from the bottom of the mountain. My friends and I could feel the joy in our hearts showing on our faces!</p>

<p>Wind Pavilion on the top of Little Jinshan, the third scenic spot of the Slender West Lake, from our newspaper's data room</p>
<p>Coming down the stone steps from the "Wind Pavilion" to the Fishing Terrace, we boarded the tour boat again. We did not go to Xu Garden and Lianxing Temple on the opposite bank for sightseeing. We ordered the boatman to hold the tour boat in the hole of the Five Pavilion Bridge. (Note: This bridge has five pavilions combined into one, taking advantage of the fact that there are thirteen holes around the bridge.) Gusts of hurricane flowed through the bridge holes. We were lying down, unconsciously talking about the sky. The boatman chimed in, talking about the vicissitudes of life. He said that after the war, their livelihoods went from "good" to "bad," a world of difference. At best, they are making only one-fifth of what they did before the war. That is, there were hundreds and thousands of tour boats on the Slender West Lake before the war, but now there are only thirty or forty. He also mentioned how prosperous the ship's situation was before the war, but now it is unbearable to look back.</p>
<p>Listening to the boatman eloquently talk about the vicissitudes of life, witnessing the scenery of the lake and the two or three tour boats coming and going in the heart of the lake, I thought that the Slender West Lake was indeed withered.</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Scorched Earth View of Huadian <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Changchun Airmail Dispatch on the 15th, Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>Jilin is mountainous. After arriving, my vision was greatly narrowed by the dense peaks connecting each other. After staying on the banks of the Songhua River for several days, I wanted to go somewhere else - to see places blocked by dense peaks; but I never had the opportunity. In Yongji, I saw General Long Tianwu. He said he was going to several counties south of Yongji to see the garrison and comfort the people. I asked to go with him. He agreed. Besides me, the following people went with General Long: Yu Jun of Jilin Daily, Xu of the army, Zhao, the second battalion commander, and staff officer Yang Degang, totaling eight or nine people.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of July 1st, we set off from a small town south of Yongji along the highway. After about forty minutes, we arrived at Guanmashan Village. The car stopped abruptly. After Commander Wang of the local garrison invited us to eat "Guangdong porridge," General Long went to give a speech to the troops and meet with the local elders and gentry. In the major cities of Northeast China, such as Liaoyang, Panjin, and Changchun, I could still see more smiling faces, but in Guanmashan Village, it was rare to see them. After thanking and paying their respects to General Long, eight or nine elders expressed their painful emotions. They said that the Eighth Route Army treated them well when they stayed, but when they left, they took all the grain, leaving only one dou for a family of eight. Unable to make ends meet, many villagers had to eat bean cakes to fill their stomachs. Even the horses that used to eat bean cakes regularly now looked much thinner. There is a small school here, but there are no funds. Hunger has scattered the teachers. The one or two who have not left, in addition to teaching students, also work as school servants. Everyone's eyes are focused on coping with life, and naturally less attention is paid to the education of the future masters. Who is qualified to complain about them! After the National Army stationed here, the local area stabilized, but in some remote villages, there were still scattered bandits who came to "borrow" grain. Although the villagers had no grain to lend, they could not stand the harassment. "The National Army won't leave, will they?" They were afraid that once the National Army left, some misfortune would follow. General Long's reply to them was, "The National Army will not easily abandon a place once it has recovered it."</p>
<p>Guanmashan Village, which belongs to Yongji County, is an important defense point south of Yongji City. The surrounding peaks and highlands have National Army bunkers recently built, either square or round. After talking with the elders, General Long went to see the bunkers on the two highlands. After finishing, eating lunch, we continued to go to the southeast. The destination was Hengdaohezi, more than a hundred li away.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Compatriots Kneeling to the National Army <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>If the road was good, the journey of more than a hundred li could be completed in two hours. But the road to Hengdaohezi was so bad, especially the last section, which had only been repaired for a few days. Going up and down, with many stones, and the road was very narrow. Even the "Little Iron Island," which had conquered the original forests of India and Myanmar, made the same strange noise as the Wild Crane car. It took us a full four or five hours to climb it.</p>
<p>Hengdaohezi is a town in Huadian County, and it is also a small plain in the mountains. On one street (perhaps saying it is a main road is more appropriate), there are about a hundred houses on both sides, seven or eight of which are mud-built houses. The National Army only appeared in this small town in mid-June. This time it was passing through. When the people saw the National Army, they were so happy that everyone jumped up. They insisted on stopping the soldiers, wanting to treat them to the tea and food they had brought to comfort them. For military reasons, the soldiers politely declined. They wiped away their joyful smiles and all knelt down to the National Army, crying and begging, until the National Army used some of their things, then they let the National Army leave.</p>
<p>The people here all asked General Long to give them a speech, but there was no relatively spacious place. The two-zhang-wide "road" was muddy, and it was impossible to stand. There was no way but to hold a "symposium" in a house, with about thirty gentry and townspeople participating. First, General Long explained the purpose of the trip, which was to see the troops and defenses, and to represent President Chiang in comforting the compatriots. Then, the elders expressed the suffering of the past fourteen years and the pain of the eight months before the National Army entered. The old man sitting next to me told me that the suffering they had endured in the past eight months was deeper than what they had suffered in the past fourteen years. There are many Korean residents here. During the puppet Manchukuo era, they formed neighborhood protection groups, planted rice paddies, and ate rice. Although their lives were not as comfortable as the Japanese, they were much more comfortable than the "Manchu" people. After the restoration, they had no choice but to return their land to its original owners - their Northeast compatriots. As a result, their lives naturally became a problem. In addition, with the propaganda of the Eighth Route Army (such as how free and happy North Korea was), many young Koreans joined the Eighth Route Army. Some volunteered, while others were forced to. The local compatriots call them "Korean Eighth Route Army," perhaps "Korean Communists" is more appropriate. They acted in concert with the Eighth Route Army, and they also inflicted various illegal actions on the local compatriots. When the Eighth Route Army retreated to the east bank of the Songhua River, fifty li away, hundreds of "Korean Communists" followed them. The townspeople hoped that the authorities would send the Koreans who did not leave back to their country as soon as possible. I knew long ago that there were many Koreans in Jilin, but hearing what their ancestors said was the first time I had heard it since I came to this place.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Huadian - Scorched Black! <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Ghastly Pale!</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, after General Long gave a speech to the troops and inspected the fortifications, we went to Huadian County. The vehicles mostly took the road that the insurgents (called "Big Army" here) originally took. It was very bumpy. It took us more than three hours to finally drag ourselves there.</p>
<p>Huadian County is a bit like Hengyang. Five thousand of the six or seven thousand houses were burned down. The southeastern district was originally the essence of the area, but now it is a scorched earth. Only a Korean church stands alone in the scorched black rubble, looking particularly ghastly pale. There are more than 10,000 disaster victims, with 9,700 registered. The relief association organized by local merchants, with the assistance of acting county magistrate Deng Shisong, launched an emergency relief effort. Each disaster victim received twenty catties of rice, and those who were almost naked also received some cloth. What to do about food more than ten days later? No one knows. It is still summer now, but in two months, it will snow. They all know that this is a serious problem, and they are frightened by this serious problem. "Please have special pity and special relief for the people of Huadian!" A group of homeless elders pleaded with General Long like this. General Long promised to convey their request to the provincial government, and told County Magistrate Deng: "If funding becomes a problem, you can borrow a portion from the military headquarters."</p>
<p>The Huadian compatriots will never forget the unfilial Korean residents who acted as accomplices for the enemy. The Youth Army, which was the first to garrison Huadian, had few troops. The Korean residents provided intelligence to the Eighth Route Army, which had already retreated dozens of miles away. The Eighth Route Army immediately gathered seven or eight thousand people to attack Huadian. The disparity in numbers was too great. After a bitter battle, the Youth Army defending the city was forced to retreat north, with more than a hundred dead and wounded and more than a hundred captured. After General Liu Zixue's troops under General Long's command arrived, the Eighth Route Army retreated back to the east bank of the Songhua River. The city of Huadian caught fire a few days before the Eighth Route Army retreated. The arsonists were the Eighth Route Army, and even more were the Korean residents. Anyone who wanted to put out the fire or move out a piece of clothing would be shot. The fire was like wildfire, burning for eight days. The National Army and the staff of the temporary county government extinguished the remaining flames after entering the city. The refugees told reporters: There were so many fires, and the flames were so fierce, if the National Army had come three hours later, the city of Huadian would probably have been reduced to ashes!</p>
<p>In addition to wood, Huadian can be said to lack everything in terms of building materials. You can't buy them even if you have money, let alone if you don't have money! The disaster victims hope that the government will set up banks, prosper the market, and provide loans to get out of the dead end. Originally, Huadian was a rich county. The central Hongsilazi, Laojinchang and other places have gold, oil, coal, and copper and other mineral products. Most of the gold mining areas are in the hands of underground armies that are in contact with the National Army, while the copper and coal mining areas are still occupied by the Eighth Route Army. If electricity is restored, the gold mines can produce five to ten catties of gold every day. Some elders suggested that if the government's relief funds are a problem, it can try to use "gold mines" to offset the relief funds. General Long hopes that the Huadian compatriots will strengthen their self-defense forces, implement joint security, joint responsibility, and joint defense, support the local government in its relief and construction work, and assist the local garrison, so that Huadian, a piece of scorched earth, can regenerate in a safe atmosphere.</p>

<p>Editor: On the 14th of July, I saw in the newspaper that an ambulance crashed into another ambulance. After this strange event, my two or three brothers discussed it with each other, and the result of the debate led to another problem. Suppose at the Mud City Bridge, this six-way intersection, three vehicles came at the same time: one is an ambulance, one is a fire truck, and the other is a red police car. May I ask, Mr. Editor, which vehicle should the traffic policeman in charge let go first? Rescuing the sick is important, putting out a fire is also an important matter, and catching a robber is also an important matter. Which of these three matters is the most important? Please give us a clear indication and guidance. (Liu Jinkun and Sun Jing, residents of the Eastern Ward, 3rd floor, Tilanqiao Police Hospital)</p>
<p>(Editor's note) In principle, the vehicle on the road with the green light should be allowed to pass first, and then the congestion situation of the remaining two roads should be considered. Those that are clear should be released first, and those that are congested should be released later, still based on the traffic police's traffic lights.</p>
<p>Discussion of Concentration Area for Street Vendors</p>
<p>Recently, I read announcement No. 12330 from the city police department, which lists the entire section of Cixi Road as a concentration area for street vendors. According to the regulations, the road surface of Cixi Road is only two-thirds of that of Zhongzheng North Second Road. All sidewalks are occupied by nearby lumber yards, auto repair shops, and spray paint shops, and pedestrians cannot walk on them. Only one-half of the area is available for the passage of people and vehicles. It must also include large trucks, cars, rickshaws, tricycles, electric trams, and pedestrian traffic, which is already tight. Now that it is designated as a concentration area for street vendors, the nearby residents will suffer greatly. I hereby raise an objection to the police department, hoping that it will reconsider. (Shi Chengbin, respectfully) July 20th</p>
<p>The Bullying Second Landlord</p>
<p>Editor: Since the victory, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, resulting in a housing shortage. Black-hearted second landlords are taking advantage of the situation, demanding gold bars for renting houses. They are now ordering tenants in the houses they previously rented to move out. Although they say they are taking it back for their own use, they are secretly lining their pockets. It is extremely hateful! For example, at a certain three-story attic on Caishi Road where we have been living for a long time, the second landlord is a woman. First, she pressed us with a huge increase in rent, and finally threatened us with moving out. We replied that we would wait until we found another house. Seeing that her plan was unsuccessful, she often cursed at us, with the purpose of making it difficult for us to accept and forcing us to move. But we are salaried people, how can we find gold bars to rent a house elsewhere? In this dilemma, shouldn't the authorities, who are above the people, consider the legitimate right to housing of the common people? (Lin Le)</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Whereabouts of a Warrior Unforgettable to the People of Yangzhou: Dong Mingde Rises Steadily, Studying in the U.S. After Leaving Yangzhou, Now Serves as Deputy Commander of the Air Force <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Having read in the social services section of your esteemed newspaper on July 4th about Mr. Liu Zhonghe's inquiry regarding the recent situation of Lieutenant Colonel Dong Mingde, I, being quite familiar with Lieutenant Colonel Dong and having served in the Air Force for many years, now provide a brief account of his recent situation as follows: Lieutenant Colonel Dong currently serves as the Deputy Commander of the 3rd Route of the Air Force. In our nation's Air Force, promotions are not easy. There are not many Air Force personnel with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Therefore, considering the importance of his current position, one can see Lieutenant Colonel Dong's achievements in the War of Resistance, as well as his outstanding academic abilities. Since Lieutenant Colonel Dong's departure from Yangzhou, he has been inflicting relentless blows on the enemy in the vast skies of the motherland. During the defense of Greater Wuhan, he had already been promoted to the nationally renowned commander of the Zhikang (Resist-Japan) Brigade. Leading his brave and heroic warriors, he deployed their silver wings, safeguarding the motherland. They shot down enemy planes and wiped out the enemy. Soon after, they were again galloping in the skies, delivering even more ruthless blows to the enemy. The planes were poor, and supplies were not replenished, yet as long as there was one plane that could take off, they would face the enemy, regardless of their numbers, with bloodshot eyes, and fight to the end! Lieutenant Colonel Dong still maintains a record of shooting down many enemy planes. After leaving Yangzhou, Lieutenant Colonel Dong went to Wuhan, Liangshan, Lanzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu. Every day, every moment was fighting, fighting, fighting!</p>
<p>He was injured, but he flew again. At one time, he went to take on training work. He went to Chengdu, training batches of air force students. At the same time, he was also training students who had already completed their studies on how to fight. At this time, when our air force students had to be sent abroad for training, he was ordered to lead a large group of students to the United States for training. After arriving in the United States, his talent and insight amazed and impressed the Americans he came into contact with, who all gave a thumbs up and said, "You are top-notch!"</p>
<p>In the azure skies of the United States, Chinese air force students were undergoing intense training. Batch after batch graduated and returned to the country to participate in the War of Resistance. The batch of students led by Lieutenant Colonel Dong, after a long period of training, was also about to return home. At this time, the government was ordering a batch of B-25 medium bombers from the United States, which were about to fly to China to join the war. Lieutenant Colonel Dong was ordered to fly a B-25 back to the motherland. They departed from Memphis, USA, and passed through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, England, Morocco, Tunisia, Tripoli, Benghazi, Cairo, Iraq, Iran, to Karachi, India, and then back to the motherland, a total distance of over 10,000 miles, with a flight time of over 50 hours. However, due to weather and other reasons, the journey took about 40 days. Some of the places he passed through, such as northern Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, had never been visited by Chinese people before, let alone Chinese air force personnel. Although the people in these places knew the word "China," their understanding was very vague. After Lieutenant Colonel Dong and his party passed through, their understanding of China became more concrete, knowing that China was also flying the latest aircraft like the Americans and British, fighting against the invasion of neighboring countries. This had a greater impact on China and was more admirable than crossing the Atlantic or Pacific.</p>
<p>After returning from the United States, he held an important staff position in the Aviation Commission. Later, he entered the Air Force's highest institution, the Staff College. After graduating, he has held his current position until now.</p>
<p>This is a brief overview of Lieutenant Colonel Dong's situation after leaving Yangzhou. His efforts and achievements over these many years, I think, will not disappoint his Yangzhou compatriots who remember him, such as Mr. Liu! Finally, Lieutenant Colonel Dong has read Mr. Liu's communication. He is very grateful for the kindness of his Yangzhou compatriots and Mr. Liu, and asked me to express his thanks here. His mailing address is: Headquarters of the 3rd Route of the Air Force, Chongqing. I hereby wish you good health, and readers prosperity. July 15th, in Chongqing.</p>

<h3 id="e124">The Art of Dunhuang <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zuoren</p>
<p>More than two thousand years ago, two streams of culture flourished parallel and uniquely in the East and West: one was Chinese culture, and the other was Greek culture. These two cultures could not converge and interact due to the barriers of East-West exchange. Although Alexander had great ambitions, he stopped at the southern foothills of the Himalayas and cried in despair before turning back (this was in the 43rd year of King Xian of Zhou). It was not until four or five hundred years later, when Indian Buddhism spread to China, that Greek culture was indirectly brought in by Buddhist art, which had already been influenced by Greece. Dunhuang art is the most remarkable work we can see today that combines these two cultures.</p>
<p>During the prosperous Han and Tang dynasties, Dunhuang was an important point of East-West communication. However, since the Ming Dynasty feared the invasion of Tibet, it closed the border at Jiayuguan and left Dunhuang to foreign lands. Although the Qing Dynasty restored its control during the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods, the ancient Silk Road of Yangguan was no longer used by merchants. The once prosperous Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang gradually became buried in sand and forgotten. It is only in recent years that we have rediscovered the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang. This is not a restoration of religious sentiment, but an appreciation and exploration of art.</p>
<p>The mutual influence of Eastern and Western cultures is an undeniable fact. Scholars and experts from China and abroad have long been tracing their traces. Dunhuang art is not the work of one family or one generation, but the donations and skills of countless devout men and women, and the ingenious management of countless artists and workers, spanning more than 800 years from the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the late Yuan Dynasty. Since the Ming Dynasty, although it has been repeatedly destroyed, the temples have been razed and the statues have been destroyed. There are still 309 caves with murals, which can be considered the only surviving ancient Chinese painting academy in the world.</p>
<p>Dunhuang art has indeed suffered serious damage: the statues have been destroyed, and the murals that have been spared from natural or man-made destruction have also suffered from color fading and incomplete peeling. However, we can still see the different styles of each era, as well as the costumes and lifestyles of each era. In addition to the Jingtubianxiang (Pure Land Transformations) and other paintings in the middle part of the murals, which have an Indian style, the illustrations of stories in the scriptures and the portraits of patrons painted on the sides are all based on the system of the time in terms of people, objects, palaces, costumes, and customs. Many costumes and lifestyles that we now consider to be new and Europeanized, the Mogao Grottoes murals tell us that they already existed in China more than a thousand years ago. Standing in front of these many murals, we gained many unexpected inspirations, and we cannot help but be surprised. In some caves, if we have time, we can spend a whole day looking at them, and we can still make endless discoveries.</p>
<p>In terms of style, the Northern and Southern Dynasties were bold and dynamic, with dragons flying and horses galloping, possessing the power of thunder and wind. The figures are mostly flat and simply colored (ceiling of Cave 191). Lines are also used to outline, but the strokes are not fixed on the shape; nor are they as incomplete as the modern European New School style (the "Guardians" in Cave 143, etc.). As for the strength and liveliness of the lines, and the lightness and vividness of the figures, later generations would not dare to try easily (Bodhi in Cave 143, and the beautiful woman in "Sakyamuni's Ascetic Practice" in Cave 240).</p>
<p>The Tang style, on the other hand, reversed the rushing of the early period, gradually tidying up the costumes and entering the realm of grace and magnificence. It requires the shape of the body to be moderate in length and the color to be rich. The background also changes from simple to complex. There are towering buildings, pavilions, and terraces, all paying attention to exquisite perspective. Of course, in this kind of scenery, the performance of the characters must also try to gather all the beauty that human beings can have in one body. Therefore, the Bodhisattvas of the Tang Dynasty have plump breasts and slender waists, long eyebrows and beautiful eyes. Their lips are moist, their faces are full, their shoulders are broad, and their palms are soft. They wear tall hairpins and long hair. We regard it as an Indian style. But the idea that creates this style must originate from the "Hellenistic" style of the late Greek art. Even the dancers and musicians are beautiful enough to decorate the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. The change in these two expressions can be compared to the transition of Greek art from the free and clumsy period to the heyday in style. In thought, it can be compared to the transition of Christian art from the medieval style to the Renaissance. The Tang Dynasty was the peak of Chinese art, and the peak cannot be reached in one leap. There must first be the strong and rough style of the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty, like the vitality of life, and the power that is reached and exerted seems to be insufficient to contain the universe. During the Five Dynasties, foreign tribes invaded, and the 回紇 even trapped Shazhou. The Song Dynasty restored its homeland, but in art, it continued the legacy of the previous dynasty. The art movement had already declined from its peak, so there was no new creation in the Song Dynasty. However, when the Western Xia occupied Shazhou, the paintings in the caves, the murals on both sides of the entrance of the caves are now eroded by the accumulated sand, and most of them are incomplete. Still, at the top, you can see the symbols of the "Zodiac" (Les Signes de Zodiaque). The "Zodiac" originated in Babylon and was added to by the Greeks with mythology. Chinese mythology has not heard of this legend, and it is even more incomprehensible to put it into paintings.</p>
<p>Only one of the Lama caves is relatively large (Cave 309), which was created in the Yuan Dynasty. In the center of the cave, there was originally a giant sculpture, which was an image of the 伐喇祭喇 embracing the 煞娣. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed more than ten years ago. Today, one can still occasionally find fallen fingers and broken palms in the ruins, and the broken pieces still show the skill of weaving. The subject matter of the murals is similar to that of the sculptures, so they have been spared from misfortune. The style already belongs to the Tibetan painting system, which is influenced by the Ajanta murals of India through Nepalese art.</p>
<p>As for the statues, except for those in Cave 309, which were completely destroyed, the rest in each cave are not complete. Although their heads are broken and their limbs are torn, and only the torso remains (Caves 273, 274, 275, etc.), their divine workmanship cannot be obscured. What is even more astonishing is the knowledge of anatomy and the standard of proportion and dynamics of the sculptors of the Sui and Tang dynasties. The precision of their observation and the purity of their expression can be compared with the masters Phidias and Praxitele thousands of years before them, and the giants Donatello and Michelangelo thousands of years after them, shining together on the wisdom of mankind. Not only sculpture, but also painting of the same period. The "Lotus Boy" on the divine curtain of Cave 132, although the color is black due to age, the strokes are smooth and not chaotic. According to its dynamics, length, muscle plumpness, and undulations, it all conforms to the appearance of a child, and it is a masterpiece among the masterpieces of Dunhuang art.</p>
<p>As for decorative patterns, they are especially rich in variety. The caisson patterns on the top of each cave have their own unique designs. And the materials used, whether they are plants, animals, or wind belts, auspicious clouds, all have unexpected structures.</p>
<p>(Zuoren notes that the Mogao Grottoes originally had different numbering systems by Stein and Pelliot. The ones cited in this article were compiled by Zhang Daqian)</p>
<h3 id="e125">On the Study of Western Painting <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Written for friends who love "Western painting" and to answer the questions of beginners</p>
<p>To learn so-called "Western painting," you must start with sketching, and "sketching" must start with drawing, which is different from learning traditional Chinese painting. "Drawing" is divided into two types: one is drawing as the basis for learning to paint, and the other is drawing that is purely independent and has interesting sketches. The former is a necessary exercise during the learning period and must not be perfunctory. It can be called learning drawing. In other words, the quality of the drawing foundation determines its future success or failure. The latter has the same value as the revived gorgeous color painting, and has a kind of Qingya style, which can be developed to the interesting aspect as much as possible, and can also be called a writer's drawing.</p>
<p>The necessary stage for studying "Western painting" is painting plaster models. There are three reasons for this: First, the plaster model is a still body, which allows beginners to describe it calmly. Second, the color is white, the outline is clear, and the lines are clear. Third, the quality and color are simple and easy to distinguish. Third, when you can place the entire object (plaster model) on a piece of paper without feeling cramped and wasting paper with too much blank space, then you have entered the door and can continue to explore dynamic objects. The so-called dynamic objects, small such as insects and fish, and large such as people and scenery, all the images in nature can be taken into the painting, as long as your ability is sufficient and your foundation is good.</p>
<p>There are many materials for drawing. Charcoal, pencil, pen, and even brush can be used to make exquisite paintings. When you feel monotonous and weak, adding water color to the drawing is "watercolor", and adding oil color is "oil painting". This is the orthodox method and spirit of so-called "Western painting".</p>
<p>Regarding "watercolor", as mentioned above: whether it is watercolor or oil painting, you must have a solid drawing foundation, and watercolor is not as generally stipulated that watercolor is the second stage for beginners and oil painting is the third stage. In a word, watercolor and oil painting have their own characteristics, their own interests, and their own independent values. The characteristics of watercolor are bright, light, and suitable for outdoor sketching and still life sketches. The materials are simple and easy to carry, and it is especially suitable for primary and secondary schools as teaching materials. Since ancient times, there have been no amazing masterpieces of watercolor painting, and few people have become famous and made a career solely with watercolor.</p>
<p>Oil painting is the main material in "Western painting". Successful writers in both China and the West regard it as the main material for painters. It is more complicated than any other material, allowing the author to fully express his desire for expression. It is suitable for creating great works and can last for a long time. However, beginners often use dull colors, and the picture is prone to chaos. The reason is that they are not familiar with the nature of colors, do not know the weight, and do not understand the layers. To solve the above-mentioned difficulties, you must start by studying the nature of colors, and then you will naturally understand everything after gaining experience from failure.</p>
<p>In addition to a solid foundation, painting also requires studying how to "compose". When the author finds a beautiful object, the first thing he is anxious about is "how can I arrange it in the picture?" There are lines and lines that match, light and dark distribution, color and color contrast, objects and objects near and far... just like a musician conceiving a symphony. Therefore, before you start writing, you must carefully think about it, and you can strive for the expected effect after you have made up your mind. And the quality of the composition can be used to judge the height of the author's painting talent.</p>

<p>"Bang!" Lihua furiously picked up a teacup and smashed it over. Then she threw herself down and cried!</p>
<p>Zhang Xian didn't say anything more. But the fire of jealousy didn't go out. From then on, he regarded the girls' school as an object of sorrow and hatred. He was determined to retaliate against that "erudite" person. He stirred up trouble in front of Mrs. Mo. He falsely accused Shao Ling of having bad intentions, often enticing Lihua to the girls' school for secret meetings, and said that Liu Ziyun was the one who "pimped" for them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo didn't believe Zhang Xian's words. She knew that Lihua was a well-behaved child, and she could also see that Dong Shao Ling was not a bad person. But what surprised her was that Lihua had never taken the initiative to get close to anyone; especially men, she had always been afraid and disgusted; but only this time, Lihua actually welcomed Dong Shao Ling so warmly; and got so angry at Zhang Xian's impoliteness towards Dong Shao Ling. This was indeed something worth pondering! She thought that Lihua was already fifteen years old, and fifteen-year-old girls should be sensible. For the sake of Lihua's lifelong happiness; for the sake of her own unsatisfied desires; she had to guard against it. Therefore, she began to interfere with Lihua's actions; and forbade Lihua from going to the girls' school often; her reason was: she was afraid it would affect Lihua's reputation. Even Liu Ziyun, she didn't allow Lihua to get too close to her. Lihua understood that this situation was caused by Zhang Xian. On the surface, she didn't resist, but secretly she still often went to the girls' school, often talked about everything with Liu Ziyun (she no longer kept silent to Liu Ziyun), and often met with Dong Shao Ling. She was accepting the education of the two of them, she was learning to be a human being again, and her spirit had unconsciously begun to have a new transformation!</p>

<p>The issue of popularizing art, in today's so-called people's century, is already undeniable. The question lies in how to achieve popularization effectively.</p>
<p>For art to be popularized, I believe at least the following premises must be met:</p>
<p>1.  Art's content must be the masses.</p>
<p>2.  Art must belong to the masses.</p>
<p>3.  Art must lead the masses.</p>
<p>The trend of democracy today is like a torrent that cannot be stopped. In such a flood, the reality of the masses' lives is the best content for artists. Of course, the lives of the masses have their bright and dark sides. The artist's sole task is to expose the bright side as much as possible, while relentlessly exposing the dark side, so that the masses can obtain a more reasonable and necessary life.</p>
<p>The sacred and heroic posture of laborers, the exploitation and oppression by capitalists – these, when expressed through art, belong to the masses. Artists should go deeper, like Gorky, to make a prophecy: "The storm! The storm is about to break out! ...Let the storm rage even more fiercely!" – "The Storm Petrel." Fully assuming the duty of leading the masses.</p>
<p>Here, we must not ignore that, in terms of form, we should choose what the masses are familiar with. For example, in painting, shading is not as good as symmetry and line drawing. This is a basic condition.</p>
<p>Many friends are worried that Chinese national art will decline and eventually disappear. Therefore, they are painstakingly trying to preserve it everywhere.</p>
<p>But: I first question, what is Chinese national art? Can brush painting represent it? But it is clear that before the invention of brush and paper, there should also have been a nation, and even more so, art. It can also prove that the development of art follows the development of production technology. Useless is the mere cry for preservation.</p>
<p>If China were to continue under small-scale handicraft production, brush painting would likely remain unchanged without any problems. However, the world is no longer so simple. We need to use "atomic energy" to change the current production under the conditions of nationalized enterprises. Therefore, Chinese national art will inevitably change. What will it be like? Although we can hardly have a definite answer, at least it is not what everyone wants to preserve as national art.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we are not yet forgetful. What is the development course of that treasure, "Western painting," in China?</p>
<p>Realistic art can be called realist art. Such works rely on the writer truly experiencing actual life, without allowing for affectation.</p>
<p>For example, if a painter has never been on the battlefield or walked into a rear-area wounded soldier hospital, yet insists on creating a large composition of wounded soldiers in his attic studio, the result will be merely a shell, lacking moving power. Regardless of color or brushwork... it feels like a single breath, lacking a unified effect of composition from beginning to end, just like a Chinese painting without vitality, only a feeling of rigidity, dullness, dryness, weakness…</p>
<p>Gorky, the great writer known as a realist, whether in his "My Universities," "Mother," or "My Childhood"... all his works come from experiences in real life. Our artists should learn from him.</p>
<p>Artists with dull senses still believe that modern times only require studying a little about the emotions of brush and ink, the colors of lines, expressing life from apples, and showing nobility from landscapes and trees. But you cannot ignore the great scenes of unemployment, hunger, plunder, death... placed before your eyes. Why are you unwilling to face them and express them? Perhaps it is because you dare not?</p>
<p>No, artists, because they demand the establishment of pure art, believe that if the content is too close to reality, it will not be "pure." But, in the history of Western art, are "1830," "The Stone Breakers," "The Glutton"... many famous paintings, considered pure art?</p>
<p>Because life is stable, the senses also become dull. In the vision of these artists, there are only apples, landscapes...</p>
<p>But, society is developing forward, how can art stagnate?</p>
<p>"Art for art's sake" is the slogan of artists who want to break away from reality. However, there is no place in the world that can completely separate from reality. If a person has such an idea, it shows selfishness and stinginess.</p>
<p>Artistic value and social value are one. True art cannot lack social value, and correct social value depends on excellent artistic value to be expressed. Only wanting to improve artistic value while looking down on social value results in lowering artistic value.</p>
<p>Therefore, "art for art's sake" means striving for the determination of the social value of artworks. Otherwise, at most, it is "technology for technology's sake."</p>

<h3 id="e129">Zhong Shouzhi: The True Meaning of Art <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>I recall that when I was in school, I saw an article by Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocating aesthetic education instead of religion. At the time, it made a deep impression on me, and my current inclination towards art may not be unrelated to it. Over the past ten years, the world has been turned upside down by such an earth-shattering war; moral decline, religious decay, and the corruption of people's hearts have reached their extreme. Although the wise and virtuous people of society have earnestly and passionately appealed, they have failed to awaken the ignorant and correct anything. When morality is mentioned, it is dismissed as outdated; when religion is mentioned, it is denounced as superstition. If this continues, all discipline and customs will be completely lost. The organization of society will also be destroyed and become chaotic, and the people's suffering will deepen, truly leading to an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>We are not advocating old religions or old morality, but how can a country exist or a society be organized without a central idea to maintain the goal of unifying people's hearts? The reason for the confusion in modern society is that there is no yardstick to measure human behavior. Therefore, we must open up a smooth path in the torrent of the times, which everyone should follow, as a driving force to maintain society. This is the so-called new morality, and the foundation for building this new morality is aesthetic education. Why? Because beauty and goodness are connected, goodness is morality, and beauty is the foundation of goodness. With a foundation of beauty, there will be good behavior. The various ugly performances in society today are unbeautiful, which is also ungood. If they knew how to love beauty, they would surely hate these ugly behaviors and would not be ungood. Therefore, we believe that all education should aim at aesthetic education, to cultivate a group of students, develop excellent character, and move towards the great path of ultimate goodness, which may be able to save the declining social customs and strive for a world of great harmony.</p>
<p>Here, I want to put forward two points for discussion, which should be noted in aesthetic education: one is beauty of character, and the other is beauty of action. Beauty of character is internal, and beauty of action is external. Whether a person's nature is good or evil has various explanations and reasons, which can be put aside for now. But whether good or evil, we must always make it tend towards a more beautiful and good state. How to make it tend towards a more beautiful and good state? That requires the subtle and transformative influence of aesthetic education; being in a room of orchids for a long time without smelling their fragrance, orchids are beauty, and in this room, one can be transformed by them. If one does not enter this room, or if there are no orchids in this room, then there is no way to be beautified. Conversely, the same is true for ugliness. If we enter a fish market from a room of orchids, we will surely cover our noses and cannot stay for a day. Then, after receiving aesthetic education, we will surely not associate with the ugly society again. With beauty of character, there will be beauty of action, and beauty of action is the external expression of beauty of character, which is also goodness. Having been nurtured by beauty, we will use it as a standard for measuring things. Anything that is ungood is unbeautiful; conversely, anything that is unbeautiful is also ungood. If everyone is like this, society can move towards the great path of light.</p>
<p>But some people say that art is a luxury, a pleasure, and in today's economic collapse and lack of resources, when there is no time to save lives and seek survival, how can we talk about beauty and unbeauty? Others say, "Art is the enjoyment of the bourgeoisie, and the common people have no fortune to enjoy it." This is seeing the scope of beauty too narrowly. Beauty has several aspects: splendor and magnificence are beautiful, and a gentle breeze and bright moon are not without beauty. The painter's realm is not necessarily to express tall buildings, but in rural cottages; in the poor alleys, there are also the best beautiful scenes; beauty and unbeauty are not divided by wealth and poverty, but by goodness and love, which artists can best understand. Therefore, our promotion of art today is not to advocate for the bourgeoisie, but to promote the common people's enjoyment of beauty. Furthermore, the low level of living of the Chinese people is well known, and people often have no opportunity to appreciate beauty; most people are in dirty and ugly environments, how can their minds be improved? If the common people can have more enjoyment of art, such as art exhibitions, concerts, the opening of parks, the repair of avenues, and the construction of common people's mansions, so that life becomes more beautiful day by day, and the degree of appreciation gradually increases, I believe that sinful behaviors can also be reduced invisibly through subtle and transformative influence, wouldn't society be able to hope for progress, and how can art be seen as a luxury?</p>
<p>Therefore, we promote art, opening up a bright and splendid garden in this evil society, and in this garden, we will bear beautiful fruits. This is Mr. Cai's original ideal, and it is also our work today.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The "Love Chinese Goods" Campaign <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Hu Boxiang, the general manager of the Family Industry Cooperative, initiated the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign," which has been enthusiastically supported by various parties. Mr. Hu is a famous painter and is usually very serious about everything. To avoid misunderstandings, he formulated the following two regulations for the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign":</p>
<p>1.  The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" uses publicity methods to correct the mentality of glorifying the use of non-essential foreign goods. Other than publicity, no actions should interfere with or hinder the freedom of others.</p>
<p>2.  The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not about boycotting foreign goods. When conducting publicity, attention should be paid to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>In addition, for the sake of consistency, the slogan "It is most glorious to use Chinese goods" was also formulated and a drawing was made so that manufacturers can use it in their publicity.</p>
<p>The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is indeed a key task at present. It is certainly closely related to saving the industrial crisis, but we must recognize that the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not the only way to save industry. Therefore, when promoting it, there is no need to involve other major topics. Just follow the literal interpretation of the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" and do it earnestly. When the time is right, the expected results can be achieved, because doing the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" well can already have a significant impact.</p>
<p>In fact, the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" should be promoted not only at present but also in normal times, because China's industry is still very young. Goods produced under young equipment must be loved by the public in order for industry to progress and goods to improve. The larger the scope of sales, the easier it is to start improving. I remember that Britain once had a "Buy British" movement to promote goods made in the country. Therefore, if everyone is patriotic, they should love the products of domestic factories and protect domestic industry.</p>
<p>The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not a boycott or opposition to foreign goods movement, because there are many things that the country cannot manufacture, which need to be imported from abroad. Conversely, anything that is produced in the country and can be used does not need to glorify the purchase of foreign goods.</p>
<p>For the convenience of explanation, we can divide goods into Producer's Goods and Consumer's Goods. We currently need to import producer's goods from abroad, such as machinery, equipment, and necessary raw materials, etc. We do not need to import consumer's goods for the time being, such as various luxury goods.</p>
<p>Last year, the American "Reader's Digest" had an article entitled "The Vast World Gives America Opportunities." The American post-war plan was to help various industrially backward countries to industrialize, so America could export many producer's goods to these backward countries. When the time was right, these countries would have industrialized, and their people would be able to buy various consumer goods. This, of course, is always thinking about the overall business for America, but as long as the assisted countries strive for self-improvement, there is no harm.</p>
<p>However, in China after the victory, although some factories are ordering machinery, the market is filled with a large number of consumer goods, which Americans may consider unexpected (although in fact, due to labor strikes in the United States, the production of machinery has not yet reached the ideal level).</p>
<p>The current "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is a movement to correct erroneous mentality. Mentality occupies a very important position in all modern constructions. In combat, a sound mentality is required, and in construction, a sound mentality is also required. In fact, the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is a basic work to cultivate self-esteem. We often hear Americans say "We Americans," and Britons say "We British," but it is not easy to hear Chinese say how we Chinese are.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" can be a good starting point for all mental construction work.</p>

<h3 id="e132">New Building Materials <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>

<p>Aluminum roofs, glass walls, cement nails</p>
<p>Science is invading every house and every home with great force. The US government's plan to build millions of new family homes in recent years has spurred the invention of countless new building materials and devices. Any invention that proves useful will be mass-produced.</p>
<p>Research work is proceeding at an unprecedented rate, new products are being planned, and old ones are being improved. There has been considerable progress in roofing, paneling, and insulation. Aluminum, in particular, now has many uses. Aluminum foil insulation panels are easy to install in various forms and are durable, with strong reflectivity to heat. Aluminum can be further processed with special glass fibers to increase insulation and steel to increase strength, to make exterior wall coverings. Aluminum awnings and blinds can reduce heat by 75%: one side is polished to reflect heat, and the other is covered with silk to block heat absorption. The ongoing experiment is to replace the stone and brick of building exterior walls with aluminum; aluminum arches, windows, and roofs are already common in new buildings.</p>
<p>Steel mills have produced structural steel specially designed for building one or two-family homes. Flat, corrugated steel sheets can be used for inexpensive roofs without painting. There is also an aluminum alloy with the same beautiful and durable properties, which is made of asphalt compounds, crushed stone powder, and mica under certain heat and pressure.</p>
<p>Molding is also widely used in the construction of new houses. Building bathrooms and kitchens, building entire floors, and combining floors and ceilings of the floor below are all done using molding methods. Cement nails made by molding have replaced old-fashioned iron nails.</p>
<p>Glass is also a very useful building material. Glass bricks can be used to build interior and exterior walls. A new type of glass brick can be used for insulation, which is made by bundling glass threads together. Glass made in this way can also be used for the walls of game rooms, so that sound does not transmit to the outside. New composites of asbestos and laminated wood are used to make iron plates, insulation boards, and partitions.</p>
<p>Electronic power and heat have reached new industrial standards in the construction of fully equipped houses. In a factory in the west, the work of inlaying wood panels is done using the power of high-frequency radio waves.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Invention of Plastics <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— US News</p>
<p>"Glass handbags," "glass belts," "glass raincoats," "glass combs"... "glass" things are emerging in an endless stream. Do you know what the original name of these "glass" things is? It's called "Plastic," also known as "pliable material."</p>
<p>Plastic products are commonplace in the United States, but they still retain their mystery for most people. It is not a simple thing like cement, mud, or putty. It is a product of modern organic chemistry.</p>
<p>Plastic was first discovered in 1869 when chemist John Wesley Hyatt used nitric acid and camphor to make celluloid. This new mixture was initially used to make billiard balls that were previously made of ivory. Later, this substance became known to the world as "celluloid." It is still one of the most useful plastics. Its main disadvantage is its flammability. Therefore, a safer celluloid raw material was later invented, called cellulose acetate, which is used to produce a large number of non-flammable films today.</p>
<p>By 1930, several types of plastics had been invented, each with its own characteristics, which could be used for certain purposes. When the war began, plastics played many new roles. In every more complex piece of combat equipment, plastic played an important role. During the war, 85% of the products of the American plastic industry were absorbed by the military. Most of the remaining products were also more important necessities. Modern battleships use a thousand plastic items. Ordinary airplanes also have as many as 200.</p>
<p>Now that it is peacetime, plastic manufacturers have set peacetime manufacturing plans. They will use wartime experience to manufacture various peacetime civilian goods.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Introduction to Business Administration <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<p>An enterprise engaged in production, with a factory, equipment, and people, cannot lack raw materials, because without raw materials, it cannot make goods, go to the market or sell, and cannot obtain profits.</p>
<p>Regarding raw materials, it depends on the different situations of each enterprise. For example, a car manufacturing plant mostly does assembly work, purchasing the necessary items from various places and engaging in assembly.</p>
<p>Many large industries have their own sources of raw materials, such as the United States Steel Corporation, which not only has steel mills but also coal and iron mines, so that they can supply themselves with raw materials without having to ask others.</p>
<p>In ordinary manufacturing plants, various raw materials can be purchased according to actual needs, but in purchasing raw materials, the following principles must be considered:</p>
<p>First, the source of raw materials must be continuous and uninterrupted:</p>
<p>Raw materials are necessary for manufacturing goods. In order to keep production work continuous, the source of raw materials must not be sporadic. Therefore, there must be a precise budget. Of course, this is closely related to sales work. Therefore, before the goods are manufactured, the opinion of the sales department should be sought, approximately how much can be sold in a year. The sales department needs to study how many similar goods on the market can be sold.</p>
<p>If the supply of raw materials is interrupted, there will be a shortage of goods on the market, and at the same time, machines and workers will have to stop, causing the company to suffer great losses. But conversely, too much raw material cannot be stored, because too much and poor sales will become a phenomenon of supply exceeding demand, causing working capital to stagnate and turnover to be sluggish.</p>
<p>Second, the price of raw materials must be kept balanced and cannot increase suddenly:</p>
<p>Raw materials are one of the main conditions constituting the cost of goods. Therefore, in order to maintain the profit of the selling price of goods, the price of raw materials cannot increase suddenly. Although the selling price can be increased after the price of raw materials increases, repeated increases in the selling price of goods will inevitably reduce sales. Therefore, the following two phenomena are bound to occur:</p>
<p>A. Reduced sales and reduced profits: This is easy to explain. For example, 100 pieces can be sold each month, and a profit of 200 yuan can be obtained for each piece, totaling 20,000 yuan in profit. If sales are reduced by half, then profits will also be reduced by half. Not only that, but all of the company's expenses must be borne by 50 pieces of goods, so costs will increase, and even the superficial profit cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>B. Increased costs and reduced profits: Originally, the cost of manufacturing a piece of goods was 80 yuan, sold for 100 yuan, and a profit of 20 yuan could be obtained. But after the manufacturing cost increases, in case it is not appropriate to increase the selling price, then the profit will be reduced.</p>
<p>For the sale of goods, under normal circumstances, the selling price cannot be determined by the manufacturer and changed at any time, because there is often more than one type of goods on the market. If others sell each piece for 100 yuan, unless the quality of the goods is better, the only way is to reduce profits. The result of reducing profits can easily cause the company to lose money, even to the point of collapse.</p>

<h3 id="e135">A Letter Received <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Four gentlemen from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank sent me a letter regarding an appeal concerning "the unreasonable assignment of colleagues returning from the rear to their duties." A section of the letter stated:</p>
<p>President Pei, recognizing the hard work and suffering endured by our bank's colleagues during the eight years of the War of Resistance, decreed that all colleagues returning with the government should be retained at the head office and not be arbitrarily transferred elsewhere. He also issued a letter to all colleagues, offering considerable comfort and encouragement. The heads of various bureaus and departments of our bank also shared this sentiment and were able to follow President Pei's intentions. However, the Business Bureau, on the contrary...</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, I have a few thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>We have all personally experienced the hardships of the War of Resistance. During this era of great suffering, compatriots in the occupied areas, as long as they did not shamelessly serve the enemy or willingly betray our cause, also endured similar hardships. We should not harbor the special and privileged mentality of "I participated in the War of Resistance" or "I came from the rear," expecting special treatment. However, it is only right and reasonable that the authorities, out of consideration for the hardship of following the government, traveling and being displaced, enduring gunfire, hunger, and cold, should offer special comfort and encouragement to those who worked in the rear. The Central Bank can and should offer preferential treatment to colleagues returning from the rear.</p>
<p>However, the administrative procedures for hiring personnel in an organization or group have their own regulations. If necessary, and if it is reasonable and lawful to do so, they have the right to make any arrangements. We cannot resist orders based solely on the reason of "returning with the government." If it is unreasonable or unlawful, we can, of course, refuse and even file a complaint.</p>
<p>We sympathize greatly with the letter from the four gentlemen of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. The reason for not publishing it is that the letter lacks more concrete facts.</p>
<h3 id="e136">"Everyone Has a Newspaper to Read, Everyone Has a Book to Read." <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Xu</p>
<p>Suggestion: Establish a Shanghai Culture City at the Racecourse</p>
<p>In the article "Opinions on the Municipal Library" in the July 14th "Free Talk" column, the author presented four points for improvement to the management authorities, roughly as follows: (1) Western books outnumber Chinese books, and new magazines are not visible. (2) The catalog boxes are all in Western languages. (3) Library services, such as borrowing books and the use of the elevator, are suspended on Sundays. (4) The staircase is not clean.</p>
<p>Libraries are places that supply people with spiritual nourishment. In China, where culture is underdeveloped, library facilities have always been rudimentary. Shanghai is known as a city of culture, but I wonder, when foreigners come to this "city of culture," where can they find a trace of cultural atmosphere besides the superficial prosperity and extravagance?</p>
<p>The existence of the Shanghai Municipal Library is of historical significance. The reporter had long wanted to understand the situation after its takeover, so after reading the article, I made a special visit.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived, Director Zhou was personally writing a letter to this newspaper, preparing to provide answers. Upon seeing the reporter, he said with a smile, "You've come at just the right time. Please convey this on my behalf." He first stated that he would humbly accept external criticisms and actively make improvements. However, the first two points listed in the article were, in fact, misunderstandings. The number of Chinese books in the library is not only not less than that of Western books, but it exceeds them by more than two times. Currently, the library has 21,260 Western books and 97,178 Chinese books. Because they were in a chaotic state when taken over from the former British Public Works Department, it was difficult to organize them all at once. They are still working hard to compile them. The reason why Chinese cannot be found in the catalog boxes is precisely because the numbering work has not yet been completed. More than a dozen people are working hard to speed up the compilation. The first collection of catalogs will be completed by the middle of next month. Regarding the addition of new books, because of limited funding, it is really impossible to purchase them. There are currently about fifty types of the latest Chinese and Western magazines, which are regularly available for readers to read. The reason why they were not discovered is due to it being Sunday. The Municipal Library, due to a lack of staff, often cannot operate as usual on Sundays when shifts are rotated, thus affecting readers' ability to study. However, Director Zhou also understands the importance of libraries on holidays, so he has begun adjustments starting this week to ensure that readers are not hindered by Sundays. Director Zhou also stated that the elevator was not out of service because it was Sunday, but because the elevator had happened to be broken these days and had been out of service for many days. Director Zhou fully acknowledged the uncleanliness of the stairs and expressed regret. Because there is too much dust there, Director Zhou will order the workers to sweep twice a day and has already added more than a dozen spittoons.</p>
<p>Director Zhou then told the reporter that the library currently has a total of more than 30,000 readers, with an average of more than 1,000 people visiting the library every day, of which students account for 40%, the business community 40%, and civil servants, soldiers, etc., 20%. The most lacking books at present are Chinese novels, which are loved by almost two-thirds of the readers. Therefore, it is stipulated that only one Chinese novel can be borrowed at a time, and it must be returned within one week. The most difficult thing administratively at present is the lack of cooperation from readers. Often, many people borrow valuable books and do not return them. When the guarantor on their application is sought, it is discovered that it is completely fabricated. Therefore, the library must verify the guarantor before issuing a library card, which is indeed an arduous task. Some are in Xujiahui, Pudong, Yangshupu, etc., which takes a lot of time. At the same time, the readers' failure to observe public morals is also really heartbreaking for the library. Half of a batch of new magazines is stolen within a week, and it is commonplace to tear out photos and illustrations from books. This kind of behavior that harms others and is excessively selfish must be stopped by the readers!</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhou said that according to his plan, Shanghai needs at least five public libraries, located in the east, west, north, and central districts. At present, the only ones are the main library on Si Ma Road and a branch library in Nanshi, which only has more than 10,000 books.</p>
<p>Director Zhou once had a large plan—to transform the city's racecourse into a cultural city, with stadiums, libraries, museums, etc. The funding could be raised by the government issuing public bonds. This plan was suggested to Mayor Qian half a year ago, but seeing the current housing shortage and the city government's financial constraints in Shanghai, the realization of the plan is truly far away!</p>
<p>But we are always longing for: everyone has a newspaper to read, everyone has a book to read!</p>
<h3 id="e137">Trolleys Skipping Stops Makes It Hard on the Common Citizen <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Minxin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read in this publication that Shanghai trolleys are a drain on one's energy and time. It is necessary to propose corrections to the authorities to meet the purpose of being affordable, stable, and fast.</p>
<p>The red pillars in the middle section indicate a stop for passengers to get on and off. Other wheeled vehicles also have the intention of someone getting on and off, being careful to prevent injury. Sometimes, the trolley is not crowded, yet it does not stop at the stop, or it stops but the door does not open. With a "ding ding" sound, the trolley drives away, leaving those waiting for the trolley feeling greatly deceived. The elderly, women, and children carrying heavy items are left in the rain or sun, regardless. This also causes disorder in the second trolley. Because the trolley ahead does not let on several people, more and more people are waiting on the ground. The strong fear losing the opportunity on this trolley and desperately push their way on, regardless of the elderly and children. The more this happens, the more the ticket seller avoids trouble and does not want to stop or open the door.</p>
<p>For example, the number 3 trolley, westward on Fuzhou Road, eastward on Shanhaiguan Road or Datong Road often skips the stop number 19. I saw one that luckily stopped, a rare opportunity, and struggled to get on. On July 16th, I tried one last time. Starting at 6:18 PM, I waited at the Fuzhou Road intersection of Daxin Street for the number 3 trolley going west. Six trolleys, starting with the towing trolley number 148, passed by without stopping. The driver said that four trolleys had not stopped, but he ignored me. No matter if I raised my hand and shouted or risked standing in the way, he ignored me. Finally, as it was getting dark, I saw the trolley for Maigeng Road had also returned. It was already 7:28 PM, costing one hour and ten minutes of time, but all was in vain. I eventually went to the Nanjing Road stop. There were still twenty or thirty people waiting there, but the trolley was extremely spacious, and both the front and back were not full of seats.</p>
<p>I think those drivers and ticket sellers believe that passengers can walk a few more steps, but passengers think that the red pillars are definite stops, and they have already walked quite a bit from East Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>This is just one example. The same situation occurs at many other stops. I hope that the old stops in the middle of the long distance can be corrected and restored, with the aim of benefiting the common people.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhongji</p>
<p>"Time is money" is a saying that sounds even more relevant to city dwellers, but every day we can see many people walking on the streets. Isn't this a waste? Do these people not like to take the bus or save time? No, it is really because transportation is too inconvenient. Look, even the most ordinary trolley in Shanghai today is not easy to enjoy.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, aren't cars also weaving through the streets like a tapestry? Look! Inside an eight-cylinder sedan, besides the driver, there is only a petite mistress hiding in the corner of the car. Compared with the trolley, which is like a sardine can about to burst, isn't it a humorous satire? Why is it that on the one hand, some people have no car to ride, while on the other hand, some cars have no one to ride, or are not allowed to ride?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the United States, the birthplace of the automobile. Cars are very common in the United States, with almost every family owning a car, but there are still many people who do not have the opportunity to own a car. What do they do? According to people who have lived in the United States for a long time, in the United States, as long as you see an empty car, you can ask the driver for a ride. At that time, the driver will never refuse the request. He will definitely give you a free ride. Especially every Saturday, the roads near schools are full of students. Upon seeing a privately owned car entering the city, they ask for a ride, and the car owners are very happy to accept it because it is fun to have a companion join them on a lonely journey. Moreover, Americans like to make friends.</p>
<p>Even the American military vehicles in Shanghai can be requested for a free ride. As long as the driver is not a White Russian or a Jew, and it is not a official vehicle marked for a specific unit, almost any vehicle will grant the request. The author himself has had four experiences.</p>
<p>But why is it not the same with Chinese-owned cars in Shanghai? Perhaps no one has ever asked the pot-bellied merchant sitting in a privately owned car for a free ride, but even if you have the courage to ask, in addition to a flat refusal, you will definitely be laughed at as crazy!</p>
<p>Cars come from America. When friends who own private cars examine whether every part of the car's mechanism comes from the United States, why don't they learn the good things from others?</p>

<p>The United States has always respected women and advocated "ladies first." Therefore, in theaters, one cannot impolitely ask them to remove their fashionable hats. So, the clever theater authorities came up with a solution by projecting the following words on a slide:</p>
<p>"In order to respect elderly women, all older ladies do not need to remove their hats."</p>
<p>As a result, all the women's hats in the theater were removed.</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Alas? In summary, during these nine years, you were always worried about the country and the family, expending your mental and physical energy, and finally you were worn out alive! I remember after you returned to Suzhou sick on the Lantern Festival, I tried my best to persuade you to let go of everything and enjoy life while you still could. Once you were a little healthier, I would accompany you to listen to storytelling, watch movies, and taste all the sugar foods and snacks in Guanqian Street and Xuanmiao Temple, using these small pleasures to compensate for the bitterness and hardship you had endured for nine years. You even smiled and agreed, saying we would definitely do that. At that time, I also promised you that I would definitely find another way out in the future and no longer engage in that sickening writing career, which made you worry about my health. So, both sides had no objections, and it seemed like we had signed a gentleman's agreement. Even though you were bedridden, I still let you manage the income and expenses. As soon as I got money, I would gather enough of it, tens or two hundred thousand, and hand it over to you, fearing that I gave you too little and you would run out of it all at once and start worrying again. I think you understood my painstaking efforts in your heart, right? During the few days when you miraculously recovered, I often asked you what you wanted to eat. You shook your head and replied, "I don't want to eat anything. This illness has already cost you a lot of medical expenses. I really feel bad. In short, is your financial ability enough?" I replied repeatedly, "Enough, enough, enough!" While busily showing you the ten or more tens of thousands of cash I had gotten that day from selling some jewelry. You asked where it came from? I lied and said it was remitted from the Shanghai newspaper. Only then did you smile slightly and say, "Then, I can rest assured." Alas! Feng, why did you always have to be so considerate of me? For your sake, I would be willing to ruin the family. But medicine was ineffective, gold was useless, and after all, it could not buy back your most precious life!</p>
