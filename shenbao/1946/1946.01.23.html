<h3>宋院長在滬會見記者　今飛京轉粵視察　政府對航業決謀健全發展</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕宋院長抵滬後，聞將於廿三日由滬赴京，轉飛廣州視察。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕在「新」「速」「實」建國聲中，行政院長宋子文昨于招待記者席上，率直的說明政府關于扶持我國紡織業蠶絲業的基本政策及復員期間增强船舶運用的方針。宋院長所闡明的是：「政府旣訂立輕工業離民營的經濟政策，爲什麽又組織了官營的中國紡織建設公司及中國蠶絲公司」？此外，宋院長又解釋強化船舶調配之重要性。及政府對于建立健全的海河航運機構的措施。</p>
<p>勝利後，宋院長來滬已有三次，昨在中國銀行大厦舉行的招待會，是宋氏回國後第一次的與記者「集團」會見，亦是勝利後初次與滬地託者相見。在招待席上，因時間關係，各記者所發問題，皆限於紡織，蠶絲及航運三個問題。綜合宋氏談話：（一）關於中國紡織建設公司創立意義（見另條書面談話）。</p>
<p>（二）關於應付復員建設時期船舶的缺少。宋院畏說：政府已組織船舶調配委員會，以謀運用少數的船，去應付極大的需要，同時以種種方法向外國購買船隻，以便沿海及內河運輸皆得逐漸暢通，茲已向菲列濱購得舊船十五艘，又向美國訂購新船十艘。此外，爲求迅速解決航運問題計，已向怡和·太古兩公司租得船隻，以便運送善後救濟總署救濟物品。政府爲顯及現實情形，已准該兩公司暫掛英旗，在我沿海及內江行駛。雖然廢除不平等條約不准外籍船隻在我沿海內江行駛，然此項措施係臨時的。對我國實際有益，而無損我整個主權。宋氏又對我將來航業的發展抱了極大的期望。他說：政府以後有能力集中經濟力量，去逐步充實我國船隻的總數。宋院長提到招商局及日郵船公司是在同一時期創立的，然我國因管理失當，招商局未能謀得發展，而日本郵船確成爲世界上巨大海運機構，深致感慨。宋氏說：目前情形雖困雜，然二三年後我能實是求是去幹，定能達到理想目標，超過日太郵船會社在戰前的成績。</p>
<p>（三）關於中國蠶絲公司，政府亦感覺到在戰爭期間我國蠶絲業百分之七十已被摧毀，而戰前我國絲業在技術上不求進步，絲質優劣不一，而在國外市塲售價亦無一定標準，致不能與日本生絲出口業競爭。國外生絲市塲大都操縱於日人之手，政府在組織絲業公司之初，是本提倡精神，並特聘絲業專家葛敬中主持，以期對我國絲業能作整個發展計劃。政府茲擬向日本追回桑樹苗五百萬株，並賠償大量蠶子，以便恢復我產絲業。中國蠶絲公司的組織，亦係過渡的，以二年爲期，此後至多延長一年即歸民營。</p>
<p>宋氏並介紹葛敬中氏起立致詞，萬氏略謂：我國絲業在國際市塲上地位被日人們奪取，今後必須自日人手中取回，日本戰前在國外年銷近八十萬担，換來的外匯，亦就是侵略政策的資本。日軍過去對我國桑田及蠶絲業的毀壞，是有計劃的，他們是想達到毀滅我全國絲業，使中國不再成一產絲國家。</p>
<p>在招待席上，有記者問：各收復區在淪陷時期，敵僞曾强向人已徽收大量紗布，此項紗布請應否予又發還。宋工答稱：此係法律問題，容硏究後公平處理。又有記者問：聞長江各輪船運輸客貨均有黑市，此種流弊政府能否採取有效辦法。宋院長答稱：此種流弊當然應予取締，但目前船隻缺乏，即令取締，亦難絕跡，一俟國外訂購船隻運到，則流弊即能減少。復有記者問：能否與外國輪船公司商議，在航行我國海岸及內河時，懸掛我國旗，以重主權而正觀瞻。宋氏說：此次借用外船，全係供應現實需要，現實問題，我們也不能不重視，好在我用外國船是臨時性的，希望暫時能忍耐。昨日出席招待會者，計有行政院臨時駐滬辦事處主任彭學沛，中國紡建公司總經理束雲章，中國蠶絲公司總經理葛敬中及各記者三十餘人。</p>
<h3>行政院昨會議　派大連接收委員</h3>

<p>〔中央社重慶廾二日電〕行政院例會現暫改爲每兩週關會一次，下次例會，仍將在渝舉行。</p>
<h3>軍事法庭　決設在南京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕專以審理戰犯之軍事法處，頃決定由軍事機關代表三人會同司法機關組織之，該庭已着手進行中，一俟成立後，將審訊所有一切在華戰犯，該庭次設南京。</p>
<h3>京蕪路逐段拆卸　技術員出發一月可完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廾二日電〕交通當局頃已決定將京蕪鑯路逐段拆卸，用以搶修爲共軍所破壞之津浦鐵路。江南路局副經理周鼎廷，昨已率領大批拔術人員前往蕪湖，拆卸工作將於廾二日自蕪開始。但爲維持交通計，決逐段拆卸，逐段停車，未拆除處仍照常通車。此項工作，預計一個月可完成，而將來重修則需時三月。</p>
<h3>熱省府人員集朝陽　大批國軍正分路開往東北</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十一日電〕熱河主席劉多基暫在朝陽推行省政工作，留平熱省府人員已奉令分別循空陸兩路趕往朝陽，國軍到達之朝陽·阜新等地，市面已行恢復，中央銀行即前往設行。</p>
<p>〔中央社朝陽二十一日電〕熱省府及其附陽人員，今日又有百餓名乘車抵此。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿二日電〕報載，大批國軍，正由陸海空三路開往東北，新六國及新一軍主力已開到東北，第五軍定下月初自雲南取道海防，由水道開往東北。</p>
<p>〔中央長春廿一日電〕今空運部隊續有一部抵此，昨又氣候關係，曾停運一日。</p>
<h3>北平金價週來飛漲　竟突破十萬大關　昆明盧比大票幾無交易</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕週來平市金價突飛猛漲，昨突破九萬大關後，今午行市百尺竿頭，更進一步，竟被十萬大關。最高每兩達十萬零七百元。美金亦漲至一四八〇元，白銀銀元亦均上漲，物價受此刺激，亦形堅挺，金價上漲原因，據悉純係上海金價暴漲影響所致。</p>
<p>〔本報昆明廿一日電〕印度政府禁止大票面盧比流通後，昆市盧比交易極少，千元以上大票幾無人接手。據商界某巨子估計，昆市盧比流通額，約在三千萬元左右，該項法令若可實用於國外，則昆市金融界所受損失頗大。</p>
<h3>美軍留淔物資　我正清理接收</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿一日電〕抗戰勝利後，美軍相繼離昆，留下了多少物資，我們接收了多少物資，這是一個軍事秘密，局外人無從知道這個謎，但在昆市商店裏，在地攤上，可以公開買到美軍各種物品，在某些人的官邸私寓中，可看到不勞而獲的美軍用品，這些東西由何而來，似乎已成了一個公開的秘密。查禁的命令，不知道重申了多少次，也記不清實施了多少次，結果仍無清于事，一般人的目光，注視收復區的接收工作，什麼地方出了毛病，在報紙上還可見到，但對大後方的各項實際問題，則諱莫如深。據某高級將領談稱：美軍留在滇境的物資，就整個歐西戰區而言，有如滄海一粟，但在中國實係一筆大數。我軍事當局特于最近在渝設立接管美方物資機構，並在滇黔淵桂等省設立特派在滇黔湘桂等省設立特派員辦公處，趙特派員一肩中將，督率專家百餘人，已於最近由渝抵昆，開始辦理清算接收等工作，預計可地兩月左右竣事，此聞人士對于這個新機構寄又極大的希望。</p>
<p>〔本報昆明廿一日電〕昆明區美軍，暫定本月廿五日爲最後撤退之期，部數瑞僅百餘人，多係陸軍航空交通隊，飛機修理隊，美軍墳墓登記隊官兵。</p>

<h3>改善人已生活　發展紡織業　宋院長書面說明設公司意義</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕宋院長昨日招待記者時，宣讀關於成立中國紡建公司之書面談話，原文如下：</p>
<p>政府在經濟建設政策，本已決定對於一般輕工業皆歸民營，此次接收日本各紗廠，本人原亦主張民營，但經政府詳密考慮之後，因之決定組織中國紡織建設公司，期限雖祗限兩年，最多再延一年，而外間一部分人士尚多未能瞭解，茲特加以說明。</p>
<p>日本在我國的紗廠，計共有一百七十五萬錠子，與我國自辦紗廠的錠子大致相等。在此次接收之初，原擬即招標出售，改交民營，但因我國商民正値苦戰八年之後，經濟力量尚未恢復，所以如即出售，恐一時承購者甚少，而且在政府方面，價格一時難以估定，政府並且對於接收各工廠，必須立即復工，因此自屬急不能待。</p>
<p>目前各地我國自辦的各民營紗廠，均以周轉金缺乏，感覺不能維持，紛紛請求向國家銀行貸款，所以即使有人承購，事實上仍須由政府予以維持，等於仍由政府自行撥款接辦，國庫並不因出售紗廠而有大量之收入。</p>
<p>次之，世界大戰之後，各國均　紗布非常缺乏，價格均形高漲。在第一次世界大戰以後，我國國內　　　起爲發達，民衆對於紗廠股份，　　踴躍，幾類發狂，但終以實業家　　制能力，爭先恐後，不明供應原理，結果不久紡織業遂一厥不振。目前狀况又復相似，經營紡織榮之利益，可以對本對利，而經營紡織業之人民，旣一時無此實力購買，試問政府具有何種義務，必須以此項紗廠售給於現有財力之少數人民，助其發財。依照上述谷點，政府所以決定於兩年以後經濟狀况穩定，人民力量可以恢稪，紗廠一切設備，屆時亦可又估定適當價格，即將各紗廠分別分開標售，此係以原有日本紗廠組織之單位，按每單位標售。而且還有一種方法，即是將各單位接辦開工之後，價格可以估定之時，發售股票，股票完全公開售給民衆，達到百分之五十一以上，即召集股東大會，改爲民營，政府祇處於監督的地位。</p>
<p>以上所說，對於政府所以暫將紗廠歸爲閘營之理由，已經有較詳之說明，但還祗是消極方面的理由，此外，尚有積極方面的理由，尤堪注意，故再略述如下；</p>
<p>政府對於人民的衣食住行，所謂民的四大需要，必須負責確謀改善，　提高並供給其生活所必需，紗布係　生活必需品，政府必須對於紡織業之發展，力促其成。</p>
<p>在此次抗戰以前，日本在國外紗布市塲，每年約有美金三萬萬元，其所用原料，大部均由我國獲取，日本紡織業各集團在其本國，自己對自己，固然必有競爭，但對國外，則取一致的行動，無論在運輸方面，金融方面，保險方面，政府及各項企業組織，組成一體，如此盈虧係屬整個計算，故能具有這樣的成功。我國紡織各廠，在國外市塲，向係各自爲政，在菲列濱及南洋羣島，我國同胞爲數雖多，經濟力量操在我手，但紡織業銷塲，我國毫無地位，盡為日本所獲。現在日本紡織業已經摧毀，對於其原來市塲，逐鹿者甚衆，政府責成中國紡織建設公司，在短期間內領導紡織事業，同時由招商局及其他中國輪船公司國外航綫，國家銀行之外匯銀行，以及我國各保險公司共同協助，俾能以獲得日本以前在國外之每年三萬萬元美金之紗布市塲。</p>
<p>最後，紡織業之織器廠，至爲重要，現在正由中國紡織建設公司聯合各紡織廠接辦各有關之日本機器廠，使能自造紡織機器，初步計畫，期於一二年內，每年能達到造成錠子二十五萬枚，並製成自動織機六千台，以後我國所需紡織機器，可以源源自給，我國紡織業之基礎，亦可以確立。</p>
<p>綜上諸端，是政府對於組織中國紡織建設公司，具有苦心孤詣，皆係事實，決非單純的國營，民營口號所可概括批評也。</p>

<h3>英军留驻爪晆希臘　蘇代表嚴厲責難　旨在對伊郞申訴行施報復手段　此舉不啻向聯合國會投一炸彈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十二日電〕蘇聯對希臘與印度尼西亞境內因有英軍駐留而造成之局勢，正式提出責難後，已使今日聯合國機稱之作趨於複雜，因而新理事會中「五強」之能否團結一致，巳通過首次試驗。英美官吏對於蘇方此項突然之行動，曾於淸晨忽促舉行會議，但尚無正式之反映可尋。自外交之立塲言之，蘇方之行動可認爲對伊朗向安全理事會提出申訴之種報復，其提出係在德墨蘭政府辭職後數小時內發生。設伊朗國而成立對蘇更友好之政府，則伊朗之提案可能就比告一結束。此外，該一行動係發生於蘇聯外交副委長維辛斯基預料即將抵達倫敦之數小時前，渠之姍姍來遲曾引起種種猜測。蘇聯代表團代理團長葛羅米柯以書面方式，向安全理事會提議，要求聯合國機構問題採取行動，烏克蘭首席代表馬奴伊爾斯基亦以書面方式要求聯合國機構對印度尼西亞問題採取行動。葛羅米柯稱，目前英軍之留駐希臘，已成爲對該國內政局勢施用壓力之一種方法，馬奴伊爾斯基指責印度尼西亞境內之英軍與「日本敵軍」業已採取行動又對付當地之已衆。蘇方認為該兩處之局勢，均足威脅「和平與安全之維持」。英國某高級方而人士認為蘇聯之行動，乃反對英國支持伊朗之一種對抗行爲，但對蘇聯能否在安全理事會獲得必要多數即七會員國之支持一點，表示懷疑。設蘇聯不能達到此點，即不能將希臘與印度尼西亞問題置於議程中。蘇聯之行動已使安全理事會對於推選聯合國機構秘書長之迫切問題，更趨複雜，因此點須獲「五強」之一致同意，而目前尚未實現。安全理事會之十一個會員昨日曾就此項問題，作正式之討論，但未獲得任何協議，預定於再舉行一次非正式會議。安全理事會自伊郞題提出以來未曾集會。衆料「五强」對推選秘書長一事意見有一致之希望時，再舉行正式會議。</p>
<h3>英內閣召開　緊急會議　貝爾納斯展期返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」據倫敦二十二日廣播：英內閣今日下午召開緊急會議，討論蘇聯向安全理事會抗議英軍留駐希臘及印度尼西亞一事。英首相艾德禮稱，蘇聯此舉，完全出乎英政府意料之外。又據希臘總理聲稱，英軍留駐希臘，完全獲得希政府之同意。聞安全理事會已定星期四開會，討論蘇聯之抗議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十二日電〕蘇方所提出之問題，其性質與伊朗間題稍有不同，伊朗係就有關本身之問題向聯合國機構提出，但蘇聯提出之問題，與本身並無直接關係，然根據憲章第五款，蘇聯有充份權利向聯合國機構提出上述問題，因該款中規定「聯合國之任何會員國」得將「任何糾紛或局勢」，向安全理事會或全體大會提出促其注意。此間聯合國機構官吏之最初反映，認為反對英國對希臘之政策，實較反對英國對印度尼西亞之政策更爲堅强有力，並指出英軍之在印度尼西亞，係遵照聯合參謀部之命令，前往該處向日軍進行接收工作，但聯合參謀部雖有命令，英方之行動仍遭全世界極嚴厲之批評。今日淸晨無法與安全理事會主席梅金獲得接觸以聽取其意見，渠之辦公室中宣佈彼曾往英外交部舉行會議，衆信係與貝文外相有所商談。同時美國代表團亦於今晨集會，討論聯合國機構所面臨之各項問題。美國務卿貝爾納斯原定於星期四。返華盛頓，目下恐因此而不能成行矣。</p>
<h3>五阿刺伯國家　亦將提出要求　安全會遭過又一難關</h3>

<h3>法與南非委治地　應移會託管　紐西蘭代表主張</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廾一日電〕紐西蘭總理弗萊塞今日在聯合國機構託管委員會中，要求法國與南非將其委任統治地立即移交聯合國託管理事會，即兩國猶豫不肯宣告將委任統治地移交聯合國，殊所不解。無論其法理地位如何，就道德上言，則無一國家有權妄用其託管土地。須知委任統治地並不屬於委任統治國。先是，法外長學都兩曾在上星期六日宣稱，法國將考慮以委治地移交聯合國，但須徵得法國與法委治地關未朗及托古倫二處代表之同意，訂立一託管協定。法屬幾尼亞代表今日告委員會稱，法國欲將開末朗與托古倫併入該國版圖，兩地代表現正協助制定法國新憲法。弗萊塞因此立即要求法國宣明其意向。南非亦曾表示將西南非舊德屬地併入南非聯邦，弗萊塞當宣稱，凡企圖兼併委治地者，將使國際義務成爲廢紙，在法理方面雖不明瞭，但就道德上當，此等國家應同意將其委治地一幷移交現在聯合國託管委員會。</p>

<h3>聯合國會工作　進入第二階段　社經理事會下設置　人道毒品等四委會</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿一專電〕聯合國大會上月已進至其工作之第二階段，所有程序及切實問題，均已分交六主要委員會，以作技術上之縝密考盧及討論。據統籌委員會所擬之議程表，有兩委員會本晨於中央大應及敎會大厦同時開會，另有兩委員會亦已於下午同時舉行會議。其餘兩委員會則將於本晚舉行會議。社會人道及文化委員會本晨舉行會議時，通過籌備委員會之建議。在經濟社會理事會之下，設立人權臨時社會，毒品，及人口四委員會，關於設立人權委員會一節，美代表羅斯福夫人，英代表衡爾金森及印度與波蘭代表均相繼發表演說，申述其重要性後，遂獲一致通過，設立毒品委員會一節，自經中國代表張彭春發表演說，强調其迫切需要後，亦獲一致通過。社會人道及文化委員會通過設立臨時社會委員會一節時，曾强調必須使該委員會將來成爲永久性之機構。</p>

<h3>伊蘇事件新轉變　哈基米內閣亂職　伊郞國會考慮新總理人選</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭二十二日電〕伊朗總理哈基米辭職後，伊朗國會定今日召開特別會議，考慮新總理人選。</p>
<p>〔路透敦二十三日電〕伊郎代表團正式請聯合國安全理事會調查伊蘇紛，未及二十四小時，伊朗總理哈基米暨全體閣員突然辭職，引起伊蘇事件之新轉變。本社昨日德黑蘭來電謂，哈甚米總理於星期日夜向伊王提出辭呈後聲稱，伊朗事件已提請聯合國機構處理，渠已認爲滿意而辭職。自亞塞爾拜然叛亂結束以來，哈基米屢作嘗試，擬經由蘇聯駐伊使館與蘇聯政府接觸，迄未達到目的。數星期前渠曾要求准其飛莫斯科與蘇政府談判，亦未得要領，故其亂職早在意料之中。繼作總理之人，以下列三人較有希望，伊北之大地主　爾泰奈·柯拉森省省長孟索爾·及前任總理畢尼亞。伊朗內閣之辭職，可使初生之聯合國機構，不致立即被迪作重大之試騐，如伊朗新政府願意作會外談判，則猶可正式撤加向安全理事會提出之聲請。安全理事會於昨日下午召開非正式會議，研究應付伊蘇糾紛最妥當之方法，茲以伊朗政府業已辭職，故似可不必早作決定矣。</p>

<p>〔路透肚巴黎廿二日電〕法國進步天主敎黨已拒絕與共產黨社會黨合組政府，以代戴高樂所領導者。共產黨乃請社會黨合組兩黨政府，而以共產黨員任政府首長。昨日三黨領袖終日有緊張政治活動。進步天主敎黨領袖法外長畢都爾與共產黨領袖陶萊士會談後曾稱，「余非先知者，然信吾人不久將有三黨政府。」至究由何人出組新政府，或須至法國制憲會議今日午後會議後，始悉其最後決定。進步天主敎黨多數領袖均不願在共產黨員領導之三黨政府中服務。昨日午後戴高樂將軍離其紐依萊地方私邸，驅軍至巴黎郊外瑪萊森林之狩獵小舍，其辭職信昨已公佈。其言有曰：「余因法國不復在緊急狀態中，故而決定退休，掣望後繼政府能完成其確保我國命運之任務」</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二日電〕共產黨今日決義推選國民大會社會黨主席戈盎，繼昨日辭職之戴高樂將軍，任法國三大政黨合組之聯合政府首長。共產黨原擬以其黨魁陶雷士爲領袖組織政府，因遭社會黨及人民共和黨之反對，故發表此項決議。國民大會定於今日下午三時開會，預料在今日下午以前，各黨間不致能成立確切之協定。現已擬有計劃，使國民大會密切注意於戴高樂之正式辭職，旋即休會以待明日續開。今晨社會黨與人民共和黨執委會舉行會議，準備於今日午後召開共產社會兩黨聯席會議。除戈盎外，聯合政府候選人名單中，以奧利沃之呼聲最高。若干政黨大半爲穩健派及右翼黨員，主張推舉前首相赫里歐繼任處高樂之遺缺，赫氏於今農自里昻乘火車抵此，渠稱將出席急進黨會議，以便檢討大局。社會黨拒絕與共產黨單獨合組純粹左翼政府，堅主組織三大政黨聯合政府，人民共和黨則拒絕參加以共產黨爲領袖之政府。爲打開此僵局，惟有另行組織三黨聯合政府，而以各黨成能接受之社會黨員爲領袖。</p>

<h3>我請求善總署　增救濟費　恐難如願又償</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕聯合國善後救濟總　本年度預算已逢三十萬萬美元，但飽經戰禍各國猶源源向總署提出請求，其呼聲殊不容忽視。此在美國人尤爲關切。因茹需額外資金、又將大部份請美國資助。在三十萬萬美元預算中，美國人已已出百分之七十以上，但此款大多猶未收集，需在國會中續提撥款請求。總署庫中雖已收到巨款，仍覺供不應求，目前總署救濟程序以用於中國者爲最大，共六萬七千五百萬美元，將於今後十五個月中充救濟之用，善後所需者尚未計及。然在中國猶覺此數不足應付救濟急需，故曾向總署請求增加至九萬七千五百萬美元。據中國分署官員稱，接此例計算，中國所得款項，遠較其他受難各國為少，實與公允原則相背。又義大利為例，其人口祇及中國十分之一，尚得四萬零九百萬美元。總署官員並不否認中國需要極巨，其請求增加有極強之道義力量。無如各國預算均經國際專家擬定，困難所在，厥在資金不敷分配耳。由現狀觀之，中國似難又獲得總署官員尚恐中國未能完全吸收入三十萬噸救濟物質，但因其國內分配系統不健全，似不能如數吸收。</p>

<h3>美商人遊華返國　談中美貿易前途　中國商業復興可期　棉織品現需要尤殷</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處鹽湖城廾一日電〕美國商人柯爾柏氏，甫自上海視察該地商業情况返美，最近對著名遠東問題作家楊格氏談稱，中美貿易前途甚爲光明，渠並預測中國商業復興。將使上海成爲開埠以來最引人及最重要之商業中心。戰事結束後不及三月，柯爾柏運抵上海之第一批貨物爲二萬五千打手帕。渠稱，去年十二月二日通貨膨脹後之物價漲至最峯，現因米麥棉花已源源運抵華中各海口，故商品數字原較世界各地物價的高三倍至十倍，目下已跌三分之二。倉庫中貨物隱藏已達四年，恐爲日人所奪，現已有物主掃數拋出傾銷。因渠等以爲一俟美國貨船開到，進口貨源源增加，則物價仍將不免下跌。據出口商人談稱，本年內中國出產之食糧價格可趨穩定，進口貨價格在今年年底又前，亦可回至世界各地物價標準。紗廠因缺乏燃料及適當設備，以致關閉，一俟依照聯合國善後救濟總署綱領，將美棉大量運到中國，即可重復開工，各種棉織口及藍斜紋布，將在中國商業活動上佔重要地位。柯爾柏不似若干外國商人之悲觀，深恐中國取消治外法權之後，將縮减外商在華享受幾達百年之特殊權益。至於香港貿易，渠稱，該港如能脫離英磅集國，則恢復可期，渠認爲英人將恢復其保險業及航業之地位。柯氏預測華北商業復蘇將較遲緩，因該地政治情况尚不安定，因此天津之復成爲商業中心，尚須有符。</p>

<h3>非洲委任統治地解放聲中　喀麥隆風光入畫　「黑暗大陸」已成歷史名詞</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室特稿</p>
<p>聯會國機構大會中國首席代表　維鈞博士，於本月十六日向聯合馴大會發表演說，希琋從鑪成立託治委員會。他說：託治制度比較　給制度有　著的進步。託治制度可加速委任統治地人民政治。經濟。社會和敎育的發展，使建立自治政府完成獨立的志願，得以早日實現，在委任統治下的數千萬人民都將受到利益。</p>
<p>就在　大使發表上項演規的次日（十七日），英國外相貝文在聯合國大會中宣佈：英國已決定將非洲委任統治地丹根伊加，略麥　和吐谷蘭三處移　聯會闕編構代管，外約丹則將使之成爲獨立邦，全場代表一致報以熱烈的采聲。英國此舉可目爲聯合國會員國迄今所採取的最賢明最坦白的一種措置，換句話說，聯合國憲章所加諸管理非自治地城各會員國的義務，英國已率先緩行了。我們認爲這是被統治各民族從黑暗時代踏入光明世界的一綫躅光。</p>
<p>英國自動放棄之委任統治地形勢</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰以後，德國在非洲的殖民地，大部分爲英國所代管，共計四處：（一）南西非洲，爲南非聯邦所代管，（二）丹根伊加（即坦噶尼喀），（三）喀麥隆，（四）吐谷蘭（即多哥）。此次英國準備放棄移歸聯合國機構託治的委任統治地便是南西非洲以外的三處地方。</p>
<h3>丹根伊加　（Tanganyika）</h3>
<p>在中非洲怯尼亞之南，面積九十四萬餘方公里，即舊德屬東非洲的大部，第一次世界大戰後由英比兩國分管，至一九二一年由前國際聯盟委任英國統治，從此英國所領的東非南非，藉此得以聯爲一氣。本區位於大地溝帶的東面，多大湖和火山，土地已漸開關，農牧極盛行，森林尤爲豐富。歐戰以前，德人處心積慮，經營此地，築有橫貫鐵道，從達累斯薩拉姆（Dareg　Salaam)日起，至丹根伊加湖畔的烏日日(Ujiji）止，並有展築到喀麥隆和西南非洲以橫貫全菲的雄圖，以與英團的縱貫鐵路相抵抗。</p>
<p>丹根伊加的住民大部份是圖班族土人，人口總數逾五百萬，歐人一萬六千人，由總督管理，下面設置執行和立法兩議會。達累斯薩拉姆是丹根伊加的首邑，有鐵路通至丹根伊加湖畔，是橫斷鑯路的起點。北面的蒙巴薩（Mombasa）是海濱的良港，商旅福轃，有鑯路通至維多利亞湖畔，是菲洲東部的門戶。其西北一角之地，歸比國代管，併於比屬岡果。物產有椰油·樹膠·棉花·咖啡·砂糖·烟草等熱帶產物，但氣候不良，開拓非易。烏日日在丹根伊加湖畔，一八七一年探險家列溫斯頓和斯坦雷二人在此會見，自此乃著稱於世。</p>
<h3>喀麥隆　（Cameroon）</h3>
<p>在中非尼日里亞和法屬赤道菲洲之間，面積三十五萬餘方公里，是舊德領西菲重要之區，一九一六年自德國奪得三年後由英法劃分，大部分歸法國代管，和尼日里亞昆連一帮地方，則歸英國代管，面積八萬零二百方公里，至一九二二年，交英國委任統治，人口不足百萬，歸尼日里亞總督兼管，喀麥隆土地肥沃，森林茂盛，產橡皮·棕·象牙等，椰子咖啡，培植尤盛。在喀麥隆河流的流域中，埋藏着無盡藏的礦物資料，可是由於氣候的惡劣，故始終未能順利開發。</p>
<p>在喀麥隆的內地，天主敎的牧師很多，其中以北歐人居多。他們往往在酷熱和疫癘的夾攻下，出入於黑人的都落中，從事於傳這工作。</p>
<h3>吐谷蘭　（Togoland）</h3>
<p>在黃金海岸殖民地和法屬達荷美之間，面積三萬二千餘方公里，原爲德國所佔領，一九四五年八月德人無條件交出，第一次世界大戰後，由英法分管，英管其西部，法管其東部，海岸均法國所有，面積亦較多，英方委任統治之區，人口不足五十萬，歸黃金海岸總督兼管。吐谷蘭的羅美港，面臨着奴隸海岸，文化進步遲緩。此地出產金鋼鑽，但一般是被禁止輸出海外的·常有當地土著拿了用布包着的金鋼鑽，向街上的行旅人兜售·原來該地鑽石議山是有被指定的，凡是指定的礦山所出產的鐵石禁止買賣，所以指定以外的鑽石，便自由地橫行於銜巷之問了。一般猶太鑽石商，爲圖牟利起見，一個個都跑到道裏來活動，向當地土人收買價廉物美的鑽石。</p>
<h3>非洲特徵</h3>
<p>大沙漠，大森林，酷暑，瘟疫，林莽，野獸，是非洲的特徵，因此素有「黑暗大陸」之稱。除了里比利亞僅有的共和國外，其餘的地方差不多都被世界各强國所分割。但近年以來，先進國家的文化，逐漸灌輸進去，同時鐵路日多，交通逐漸方便，土人的知識水準也漸次提高起來。所謂黑暗大陸已成歷史上的名詞了。此次，英國首先表現了牠的賢明的德政放棄委任統治，移歸聯合國機構代管，至少在解放非洲民族的意義上，有着重大影響。相信其他管理非自治地域的國家，必將繼英國之後，毅然放棄其委任統治地，而置於聯合國機構託治制度之下。</p>
<h3>訪問硝磺當局　鄭祖亞談管制政策問題</h3>
<p>— 自明</p>
<p>硝磺爲國防工業之主要原料，其用途如軍火開鑛築路等，均非硝礦不辦。至其品類中如硝酸硫酸，更爲一般化學工業所必需。政府管理硝磺之政策，當亦爲社會人士所注意。頃聞財政部硝積總管理處，已由陪都移滬辦公。記者爰走訪硝磺管理處處長鄭祖亞氏於新閘路一三六一號，茲將談話撮要紀錄如左：</p>
<p>誰管轄硝磺</p>
<p>問：硝磺係軍火原料，因何劃歸財政部管轄？</p>
<p>答：民國二十一年前，硝磺本由軍政部管轄，當時因吾國所產土硝地區頗廣，其因製硝而附帶出產之硝鹽，製戶與人民，多私自購食，旣不合衛生，並妨碍鹽稅之收入甚鉅。前財政部宋部長爲增裕國庫收人起見，即請淮將硝磺事業劃歸財政部鹽務署管理。</p>
<p>重要性問題</p>
<p>問：硝磺在軍工方面，一部份社會人士有謂近代國家軍火之製造，已由黑米藥進化而至無烟火藥，以及其他有機炸藥，過去之以硝磺直接配製火藥者，已成爲炸藥演巡歷史上之陳蹟，硝礦實已失其軍工上之重要性者，究竟如何？</p>
<p>答：黑火藥與有機炸藥之爲物，在軍工方面，均有其適當之用途；不能謂爲爆炸性低之炸藥，即因發明有爆炸性高之炸藥，而完全廢棄。且有機性炸藥之製造，多以硝酸硫酸爲主要原料。吾國製造硝酸，尚少固定氣氣之設備，必須取材於硝石。（即硝）而製造硫酸，則非硫磺莫辦。是有機炸藥之成因，其原始材料，仍屬不離硝磺，不過多經一番轉製之程序而已。其他如用T·N·T·炸藥之裝製炸彈及砲彈，亦需配用硝磺，計自二十六年起，至三十三年止，硝磺之供應兵工製造，修築機場，龔建要塞，以及西北，川陝，川湘，樂西，挂　等公路，與湘挂，黔挂，實天，纂江等鐵路工程；暨江西，湖南，無錫各織之開採，長江烏江等河道，工程之修整；並一般普通民用之供應，總計其數量，爲硝約四十萬担，磺約二十七萬担。其需要數量，不爲不多，可見硝礦仍保持其重要性。</p>
<p>戰時的政策</p>
<p>問：管制硝磺之重要政策如何自？</p>
<p>答：政府辦理硝磺政策，在業務方面，爲自立計，當然以自力更生，自給自足為原則，又免虧累！但其重要目的，並非在增益稅收，而在嚴密管制，使國防工業與民營企業兩方面，配合得當，故管制政策之演變，係因應局勢，配合時代，以求邁進。茲分析其演變過程，可歸納爲戰時平時兩個階段：</p>
<p>（一）戰時政策：軍興以還，吾國原有硫磺豐富區域如冀魯及豫東蘇北等地帶，均已淪胥，外洋硝磺類，因海口之封鎖，無由輸入。同時，軍工等需要，反較戰前激增，且因軍用緊急，用量多少，亦無從預爲估計。一時硝磺類物品，供不應求，非常棘手。爰經採用有效辦法，將西南各省，開發蘊藏，積極增產，實行官收，把握物資。對於硝磺類工廠，更以貸給硝磺原料辦法，使廠商能騰出現金，儘先發展其業務。又以公費方式，代商銷售，不使資金積壓，極盡扶植工廠之本旨。一方面更使產品减輕成本，平抑售價，救濟以硝磺爲原料之用戶，以發展國防工業。故於抗戰期間，硝磺事業，迭經慘淡經營，能得硝磺生產遞增，供應軍工需要，從無匱乏者，在戰時政策，因採取（一）開發生產，（二）集中物資，（三）供應軍工，（四）穩定價格，（五）調劑盈虛等五項爲中心工作，收此效果也。</p>
<p>平時的政策</p>
<p>（二）平時政策：吾國硝磺物資，就硝產曾，並無如智利之硝石礦，大都由地面或增壁崖洞聞括取硝土，以爲原料，其含硝成分，每土百斤，僅含銷百分之一至百分之三，存於天然界之資源，並不豐富。就磺產言，亦無如美義等國之天然礦礦，大多由含硫之黃鐵鑛鉛鑛鋅鑛銻鑛內提煉而成，幾大半爲各鑛之副產物，較之天然鑛之產量，相去甚遠。就硝磺品類言，如硝酸·硫酸·氣酸·鉀憐類等工廠，方在萌芽，規模未宏。技術方面，亦比較落後，是以出產成品，品劣而價昻，以與歐美諸工業先進國家相較，更覺瞠乎其後。當此時期，外貨又質美價廠之物資，運銷吾國市場，國產必致完全破產，不獨影響吾國已成之工業甚鉅，即以後工廠事業，企業家亦將裏足不前，障礙建國之發展，莫過於此。爲針對時弊計，政府自應儘先推用國貨，竭力維持原有生產。一方面獎勵新興技術之改進工作，資助努力創設近代化工廠，使迎頭趕上物美價廉之舶來品。許可挽回整個頽勢，自生自立。例如目下國產之火柴原料氯酸鉀之成本，每市担在十萬元以上，而外貨售價，運運費在內，不過五萬元左右。若政府不設法救濟，予以維持，則不特原有工廠，均將倒閉，而又后關於此種建設事業，即無人敢于嘗試。將使市場永爲舶來品所佔據。</p>

<p>張君勱十六日下午抵渝，參加第七次會，着黃色呢西服，找紅領帶，戴無邊眼鏡，紅光滿面，在休息室中與各會員握手言歡。發言時，他先報告，因為在巴黎等了四天飛機，在開羅等了兩天，以致遲到了六日，向大家表示歉意。</p>
<p>鄧頴超談話風格</p>
<p>鄧頴超發言，是全塲第一次聽到女會員的聲音，她談話中的語彙，文法，完全是「毛澤東文告」體。</p>
<p>章伯鈞與大公報</p>
<p>章伯鈞爲證明無黨派對國大意見，在會塲期讀大公報的社論無黨派席上的傳斯年，王雲五等，紛紛以紙條向胡霖傳話：「好一個忠實的讀者呵！」胡霖起立致詞時說：「讀大公報，不能以一二篇社論，就認爲我們反對甚麽問題。」</p>
<p>錢新之談滬代表</p>
<p>錢新之說：「上海國大代表共八人，其中四個不是國民黨員。」邵力子先生說：「這是一個最好的說明」。</p>
<p>張東蓀引起風波</p>
<p>張東蓀出言不愼，涉及新聞記者，引起一塲大風波，全體記者聯名抗議，他在大會公開道歉。（十八日）</p>
<p>管制之範圍</p>
<p>問：硝磺管制之種類，究有幾何？</p>
<p>答：硝磺管制之種類，目下經國民政府核定者，如硝酸鉀，（即鉀硝火硝或　稱硝），硝酸納（即智利硝或鈉硝），硝酸鈣，（即鈣硝），硝酸錏，硝酸鐶，硝酸鎴，硝酸銀，磺，（即硫磺又稱硫），氣化鉀，（即鹽酸鉀，或鹽酸加里，）氯酸鉀及氣酸應類，過氣酸鉀及過氯酸鹽，，硝酸，（即硝　水），硫酸，（即磺　水），紅燐，（即赤憐），白燐，（即黃燐），乙炔化合物，三氣化實類，爆炸酸鹽類，苦味酸鹽類等二十餘種。</p>
<p>但硝磺類管制範國，應以包括一切爆炸物品為原則。現在科學，日新月異。新物品源源發明，硝礦類管制之範圍，當亦不能不隨時予以擴大為。</p>
<p>問：硝磺類管理辦法如何？</p>
<p>管理的辦法</p>
<p>答：管理硝磺類，可分爲兩種辦法。</p>
<p>（一）管理硝磺，以民製，官收，官銷為原則。產區方面，應擇集中生產之地，督導民製，統由公家給價官收，以便運銷銷區。銷區方面，除官銷外，亦可劃區交由包商包銷，但一切物資，仍由公家統籌辦理，以扶植國產爲目的。</p>
<p>（二）管理硝磺品類，又商製官銷為原則，其推銷辦法，凡硝磺品類經公家查驗后，可由公有代為配銷及自由推銷，又便商利民為目的。</p>

<p>余曰：此不肖之流耳！奚足以儕公務員之列哉？夫鳥之有梟，獸之有獍，猶人之有不有也。吾未開談烏者，因梟而棄鳳凰之鑯，談獸者，因獍而廢麟麟之德，是則，談人何可以不肖而忘公務員之功？賢不肖，各不相關也。以國家之力量，集國民之精英，加以十餘年之培植敎訓，數十度之試騐選擇，學足才及，始授以職，論質，亦可貴矣！吾國自政治入軌以還，公務員率能履行職責，以效忠國家，政也，敎也，軍也，財也，農也，工也，糜不由公務員致力揭　貢獻，以趨軌範，而有今日，雖職位大小。與夫才德高低之不同。而其輸志致力則一也。使國家收穫若斯之鉅，食報亦不過薪脩而已。論功，亦可欽矣！抗戰之後，以中國之藐弱，捍日本之領强，竟達八年之久，卒以成功。當凱歌未實，孰敢斷定其必勝，獨公務員能力守初衷，矢志不匱，仆而復起，死而復蘇者，子曾見之乎？政府遷都，追隨擁護，有始有終者，非公務員　？殫思竭慮，建議　政者，非公務員歟？含辛茹苦，宣傳國化，敎育學子，寒無衣而　不飽者，非公務員歟？展拓交通，籌劃財政，勤運輸而力生產者，非公務員歟？督師臨陣，揮汗流血，棄頭顱，爭尺土者，非公務員歟？吾又嘗見參加修築機塲之公務員矣，當其趕工時也，曾屢夜不能就寢，屑焦枯而眼火赤，猶奔馳塲周上下，求爭頃刻能成，以應軍機，迨警笛鳴了，敵機猝至，槍彈交集，死亡枕藉，視之身臨戰陣之危，殆有甚焉，孑然不死，其間不能容髮者，屢矣。子曾聞之乎？公務員之能效忠於國家也如此，可不謂忠乎？</p>
<p>客曰：若子之言誠當矣，然吾仍有疑於衷而未解者。夫公務員旣如是效忠於國家矣，而國家所待公務員者，以吾思之，應乘以革者，予以乘車，應衣以衣者，予以衣服，應食以食者，予以飽食。以吾聞之，應乘車者徒步矣；應衣冠者，襤褸矣；應飽食者，　餓矣；有父母者，喘息待斃矣；有子女者，廢學而鵠立矣；衣冠溫蔽，菜色鳩形，歲暖而兒號寒，年豐而妻啼饑；髮斑斑者，盡化而爲白矣；齒搖搖者，盡脫而落矣。病矣哉！豈國事之無虧，而家室應有所缺乎？抑平日垂頭致力，盡忠國家，而食報如此，子亦漠然不聞不覩者乎？今國已達勝利，躋人四强，如草木之欣榮，朝氣蓬勃，萬事更新之際，對於投資營利之徒，尚憂其破產，定有救濟之方，而獨置公務員於不顧！勝利獎金，公務員無預焉。被選舉權，公務員無預焉。某時也授糧，某時也配鹽，某時也發制服，某時也給實物，徒見諸傳開，而少見諸實際，豈望梅果能止渴，而畫餅遂可充饑歟？蓋子之所命爲榮之公務員，邇近仍有减薪之令，裁員之命，豈公務員效忠於國家者，未嘗盡其力歟？抑盡力之人應須貶損歟？寗國家之明察不及歟？邦有道，貧且賤焉恥也。貧賤交迫，死而後已。公務員努力之目的，在求恥與死，此吾所以不解耳！子盍有以敎我？</p>
<p>余曰，然。君子憂道不憂貧。昔者子買見原憲，以貧爲病原憲責之。今日子之所見，猶子貢也。夫樗蒲陣逐貪婪不肖者，公務員之病耳；饑寒交迫，衣服艦褸者，公務員之貧耳。病者難醫。而貧者易改。公務員能立身蹈義，力挽國運於危瀾，因而轉勝，此公務員之責也。待遇菲蒲，報酬短絀，國家之責也。國之有策，猶家之有政也。信賞必罰，國之權力，至施行之緩急，自亦視國家之力量，而爲之後先。今者吾國初興，急事繁多，報酬救濟之一端，尚非至急，爲公務員者、應只知盡精忠之責，不必斤斤乎報酬之一途。雖然，公務員爲國柱石，與國同休者也。國之不可任公務員困窮，趨於死亡，猶公務員之不能任國家墜落致於破敗者也。今者吾國克勝强敵，日求維新猶若出幽谷遷醫木，脫危途步康莊，吾信中央必將於最近改善公務員待遇，以資安定，斷不能一任墜落滅亡，斷喪無氣。且將來公務員之際遇，將隨國勢以日高，生活隨國計以日裕，名位亦將隨國運以日隆，豈特救濟而已，謂之光榮，要非虛言。至於裁員减政，亦關國是，裁於此，而補於彼，調動職務，庸何傷乎？故吾之所憂，在公務員之能稱職與否，廉潔與否，不在乎報酬之厚薄也。孔子曰：「不患無位，患所以立，不患莫己知，求爲可知也。」</p>
<p>客喜而笑曰：聞子之言，食夫廉，懦夫立，家無逆子，國無亂民矣，而吾疑以釋。吾不復以少者譏衆，短者譏長，以不肖者譏賢，再拭目以觀子言之必行也。吾當爲予賀，轉爲公務員賀，而更爲國家慶也。（陳澤廣）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>世界人類的經濟自由</h3>
<p>在這第二次世界大戰中，同盟國或聯合國方面的作戰目的大致是：（一）就中國講，至少是一八九五年前領土與行政完整狀態的恢復；（二）就英國講，是歐陸各小國的獨立與自由的恢復（這是英國戰時首相邱吉爾語），與人類社會安全之獲得（戰後社會安全應爲人生的新目標，來替代戰前的私人營利或利潤主義，如果戰後仍發生失業現象，使勞動者沒有經濟安全，勢必又產生獨裁主義，——這是現在英國外相貝文氏於一九四〇年十一月對倫敦扶輪社演設的大意）；（三）就美國講，是故羅斯福大總統的人類四大自由，與前華萊氏副總統的人類七大自由之獲得。</p>
<p>美國故羅大總統的人類四大自由是：第一爲言論自由，第二爲信仰自由，第三爲不虞匱乏的自由，亦即無貧乏無失業無經濟失調的自由，第四爲無所恐懼的自由，亦即不受外敵侵略的自由。前華副總統的人類七大自由是：第一爲無失業恐懼之自由，第二爲無老而無告的恐懼之自由，第三爲無疚病及餓恐懼之自由，第四爲無工商階級及農工階級的鬥爭之自由，第五爲無必需品生產過剩因而引起破產恐慌的恐懼之自由，第六爲無人種及宗敎的鬥爭之自由，第七爲無政府的過份干涉人民個人思想與發明之自由。華氏以爲目前世界上人類所急需的，就是這七種自由，有了這七種自由，那末人類即能永久享受和平幸福，否則，人類的前途，大多是悲慘的。</p>
<p>上述美國故羅大總統所呼號的人類四大自由，第三個是經濟的，第四個亦有一半是經濟的。現在離德國投降之日已有九個月，離日本投降之日亦已有五個月，試問不虞蕢乏的自由，各戰勝國是否已經獲得呢？（戰敗國姑置不論。）吾人不得不承認「還沒有」。又試問無所恐懼的自由，各國又是否已經獲得呢？因爲原子能國際管制問題之尚沒有完滿解次辦法，吾人又不得不承認「也還沒有」；而且好像各國人民的心理是更加恐懼原子炸彈一類新武器之使用，必將無情地把人類的文明完全毀滅掉。</p>
<p>至上述美國前華副總統所提出的人類七大自由，前五個都是關於經濟的。試問自德日兩國無條件投降之後，世界各國人民不問戰勝戰敗，對於還五個經濟自由，是否已經獲得呢？吾人又可以乾脆地國答說：「還沒有」。不過第五個無生產過剩恐懼之自由，目前世界各國除美國外，大致是不成問題的。因爲牠們目前處於戰亂之餘，破壞不堪，荒凉滿目，根本上沒有什麽生產過剩之可言；不過將來於元氣恢復之後，也許又要鬧生產過剩問題，一如一九三〇年左右世界經濟恐慌期中所演出者。</p>
<p>其實，人類無不具有求生存之慾望，戰爭之起因在求交戰國人民之生存，而戰爭之終止與和平之恢復，亦在求交戰國（不綸勝利國與戰敗國）人民之繼續生存，至歷來哲人學者對於永久和平社曾計劃之不斷研究討論與倡導，其目的亦莫非爲求人類之生存，亦即國父孫中山先生之所謂民生主義者是。（所謂民生主義，就是「人民的生活，社會的生存，國民的生計，羣衆的生命」的主議。）假使民生主義果眞能够完全實現於世界各國（不祇中國一國），那末上面華氏所呼號的五種人類經濟自由與安全（其實安全與自由是不能分離的，無安全即無自由，無自由亦即無安全），自然都不成問題，旣無失業恐懼，復無老而無告之恐懼，又無疾病及饑餓之恐懼，亦無階級鬥爭之恐懼，更無必需品生產過剩致引起生產者破產恐慌之恐懼。</p>
<p>不過目前世界各處所呈現於吾人眼簾前面的各種戰後紊亂現象，實在是從戰爭時期的動員狀態轉變到和平時期的復員狀態之間的不可避免的過渡時期內的失調與磨擦。人類於第二次世界大戰的空前浩刼之後，痛定思痛，一定要想盡種種方法來避免第三次世界大戰的更加慘烈更加浩大的犧牲（因爲第三次世界大戰，必定是慘無人道的原子能大戰），一定要想盡種種方法來獲得人類的四大自由或七大自由——特別是五個經濟的自由與安全，一定要想盡種種方法來實現理想境域和大同世界的民生主義。</p>
<p>吾人站在中華民國國民的立塲，也必須下個次心，以努力從事實現國父的民生主義於國內與國外，這將是吾人對國內的永久和平和對世界的永久和平的最大與最有效的買獻。</p>
<p>從這些地方看來，目前我們不但要實施已要主義，而且必須同時實施已生主義。但有許人只知道高喊空空洞洞的「民主」口號，而對三民主義中最重要精神所在的「民生」主義反而忽略了，甚至如中國共產黨領袖們也說他們不反對資本主義，以企圖博得一般私人資本家的歡心，豈非奇怪之至？我們敢提醒大家，中國——乃至於全世界，如　政治家的眼光今後還不注射於大多數的平民身上，專心一意來替平民打算他們所應獲得的經濟自山，——即故羅斯福總統所稱的不虞匱乏的自由，來替平民實現他們所應享有的民生幸福，縱使「民主」的呼聲儘管高唱，世界次難望其永久和平，人類也次不能獲得共存共榮的幸福。因此，我們願意在一般人只知道附和「民主」的時髦名詞的時候，特別提出「經濟自由」來，請政治家或政客們千萬注意！</p>

<h3>五千餘失業工人　昨向市政府請願　何副市長等詳加解釋　盼互諒互愛勞資合作</h3>
<p>上海市各工厰失業工人約五千餘人，包括六十二單位，二十二日晨遊行南京路等處後，於正午赴市政府請願，推代表廿三人謁錢市長，適市長因公在淞滬警備總司令部開會，由何副市長沈秘書長代表接見，並邀經濟部特派員張茲　，上海市總工會整理委員范才騤，社會部上海市失業工人救濟委員會主任秘書趙班斧，上海市總工會主委週學湘等參加在市政府會議室與各代表會見。</p>
<p>何副市長逐項答復</p>
<p>首由何副市長發言，謂各單位呈文已閱悉，所提各項請求，有關市政府主管事項，當詳為等答覆，有關經濟部或社會部主管事項，當請張特派員及趙主任秘書分別答覆。嗣即聽取各代表陳述意見，大致均希望能迅速復工，開工工厰儘先錄用原有工人，請求救濟失業工人，請準失業工人組織工會等項。何副市長對於請願工人所求各項，逐點予以答覆，并詳加解釋，謂各工厰倘能陸續開工，此乃根本解決之辦法。目前對於失業工人之救濟，　求其迅速與普遍。關於發給善　救濟總署之麵粉，聞社會部之上海失業工人救濟會，自本月二十日起，東歐每日發三千餘包，西區發一千餘包，逐日發給，今後當繼續增加區域發給，以廣救濟。關於復工及儘先錄用原有工人問題，請張特派員向諸位答覆。總之，政府對於工人，愛護備至，對於失業工人，尤為關懷，深盼在最短期間，各工厰能開工，在各項工作厰未開工以前，失業工人普遍獲得救濟，然後在勞資雙方互諒互愛之原則下，實行合作，增加各項生產，努力地方建設。</p>
<p>儘先錄用理所當然</p>
<p>繼由經濟部張特派員茲　答覆：略謂上海失業工人復工問題，不僅諸位焦急，政府亦極焦急，本市工厰因電力不足，逐漸停工，開始於日寇侵佔上海之時期，在兩年以前即有經現象。迄於去年八月十日抗戰勝利以後，滬市各工厰經中央陸續接收，自九月十八日接收之日起，至十月十一日，即陸續設法復工，祗因煤·棉花·煙葉等來源困難，需要時間，通盤　劃，各工厰原有工人應儘先錄用，理所當然，凡經委派厰務主任之各工厰，即正在籌備開工。但若干工厰已移交其他機關管理，不屬經濟部範圍，此則當分別而言也。旋由社會部上海市失業工人救濟委員會趙主任秘書班斧，關於發給麵粉之手續，詳加解釋，盼依照規定辦法，俾失業工人能迅速獲普遍之救濟。</p>
<p>未由上海市總工會周主委學湘發表意見，允負責解除失業工人之困難。由六十餘單位推選代表七人，與總工會保持密切聯繫。至下午三時各代表始散。</p>
<p>復工問題今晨治商</p>
<p>四時許，特派員陸京士趕至導勸，工人要求先借一月薪資，復工後可扣還，周學湘氏允向經濟部特派員辦事處轉請核示，以時間已晚，經濟部辦事處已無人辦公，乃囑工人代表勸導工人先行歸去，至所提要求，除何副市長已有答復者外，允為商洽辦理，并盼工人方面推舉代表今晨繼續由社會部陸特派員京士，邀集社會局經濟部市黨部及總工會各有關當局，再行洽商復工，救濟等辦法，及至七時半，由代表傳達當局意見，旋即由各單位負責人上司散去。</p>
<p>遊行途中五人受傷</p>
<p>據聞昨日請願工人係虹口楊樹浦上海工業·上海製鐵·東華·公興等六十二厰，原由敵商經營，勝利後，迄今未復工，失業工人乃出發遊行，經榆林路·大連灣路·平涼路·大名路·遇外白渡橋·北京路·忽有某高樓　下酒瓶三隻，有永備·豐田及中國肥皂等厰工人沈炳根·顧恒生·張道良·沈景範·程德喜五人受傷。</p>
<p>請求各點大致解決</p>
<p>最後由王光青·陸京士·趙班斧·范才驥·周學湘召集工人代表商討結果，工人所提條件大部解決，（一）復工，由七人小組會協助經濟部決定取捨，兩星期以後可獲解決。（二）錄用老工友，由工人代表維持工厰秩序，當儘先錄用。（三）救濟，麵粉四天內即可發放。</p>
<h3>滬示威流行　與美軍無關</h3>
<p>美軍總部昨日宣佈：美軍部已正式接到中國政府方面之方函，明白表示在上海市所舉行之各種學生遊行示威，工人罷工運動等等，對美軍全無關係，其主要目的，并非對付美軍，希望美軍勿生誤會。</p>
<h3>接收敵產紗厰　念餘萬紗錠開工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部直屬之中國紡織建設公司在滬成立以來，逐步接收本市敵產紗厰，現已大致就緒，開工紗錠數在二十六萬錠左右。此等紗厰前原由經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員辦公處紡織組負責管理，茲以使命告成，現正開始辦理結束。惟原來經營人員大都均具技術經騐，故中紡已決定儘量錄用。</p>
<h3>敵人罪行登記　總數逾兩萬件</h3>
<p>地方法院檢察處，自去歲十一月初進行敵人罪行登記以來，至本月廿一日止，已有案件二一八一三起，該處為調節登記次序起見，已編發號碼，每日最高額為六百人，惟編號者每越千人，目前二月二十三日之號　，亦已發出，登記中以「肆意破壞財產」罪為最多，受害人可到南市蓬萊路辨認犯罪敵　，今日將有十餘人首次辨認。</p>
<h3>美國會考察團　昨由華北來滬　定明日赴馬尼刺</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國會考察團一行五人及隨員等昨日乘機自華北抵滬。該團此行任務係在調查各地美軍情形，研究處理海外剩餘物資，美軍復員及太平洋海軍基地等問題。據該團代表貝茲稱：去年十月間硫球島被颶風襲擊，損害甚重，海軍專家因此不擬以該島為海軍基地，以免再受風災。日軍正在遣送返國，在此期間，希望中國國內能互相了解，團結一致。為促進世界和平計，中國不宜再有內戰。在華日人現正積極遣送返國，希望留華美軍能在四五個月之內復員回國。韋德曼上校現負責辦理遣送日人返國事宜，據稱：現有美國自由型運輸船及登陸船共一百八十五艘由日人駕駛，經常開赴日本，運送日人返國。本年三月底返國日人每日可達二萬五千名。美軍留駐中國實具有穩定作用。本國四位代表認為美國政府如決心佔領太平洋基地，以構成美國之外圍綫，則美國或將設法使此項島嶼能自足自給。該團抵達機場時，前往歡迎者計有美第七艦隊司令柯克，該團現定二十四日晨入時首途赴馬尼拉，行前將再與柯克及魏德邁將軍會談，時間亦經排定。</p>
<h3>方祖德被控案　改期再審　否認充任翻譯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前在吳淞敵憲兵隊任司機及翻譯職之方社德，有假借敵偽勢力，強購當地居民王德欽之房屋等情。勝利後由當局依漢奸罪逮捕，移送法院，而王亦欲依法追回該項房產。該案曾一度審訊，被告否認有欺壓鄉民，及任翻譯之事。事因王德欽未到，庭諭改期傳訊在案。昨晨十時，該案由劉毓桂庭長開庭再詢，王德欽到庭，將方借用敵憲兵隊名義，強購房屋之始未，陳述一通。詰之中人王鶴生，據稱王德欽先欲出賣房屋，後由我與方接洽，因而成交，並非強購云云。繼由被告律師朱永康遞上方之駕駛執照一紙，證明方並非任翻譯之職，并附有吳淞鎮　家商民聯合具保之呈文，證明方遇去並無魚肉鄉民等情。　諭追索房產，並非刑庭所管。王德欽可向地方法院民庭起訴，并定於二十五日下午開合義庭再訊。又今日上午，將審訊鄒志高漢奸案。</p>
<h3>國勞會我代表　朱學範返滬</h3>
<p>我國出席巴黎國際勞工代表大會代表朱學範氏，於昨日下午七時乘軍有機到滬，同來者有鄧發，及秘書李佩女士出席倫敦世界青年大會代表陳家康等。</p>
<h3>吳開先返滬</h3>
<p>新任上海市社會局局長吳開先氏，日前因公赴渝，晉謁中樞各當局，有所請示。茲悉吳氏在渝業已公畢，已於昨日由渝飛返滬，不日即將到局履新。</p>
<h3>內遷工厰　請胡西園留滬</h3>
<p>遷川湘桂工厰聯合會到滬各會員，近觀聞中國全國工業復員協邇委員會主任委員會胡西園氏，日內有飛平之說，紛紛向胡氏挽請　行，昨日該會理監事會決定并書面胡展期赴平，因上海各工厰復員事宜及各項善後辦法，均須胡氏在滬主持，聞胡氏或將赴平行期展緩。</p>
<h3>三教道德會　王曉籟任會長</h3>
<p>三教道德會自民國九年創立，近為擴大　務，請王曉籟出任會長，王氏於昨日下午二時到會就任。</p>
<h3>赴青島旅客　須持種痘證　衛生局出動種痘隊</h3>
<p>本市入多以來，因氣候　　，形成反常現象，故天花一症，極見流行。衛生當局，對此頗為重視，現行積極展開防疫運動，并出動醫藥技術人員一百名，組織流動種痘　，為市民免費服務。本市航業界，已接青島航政當局通知，即日起在該地上岸上乘客，均須持有種痘證書，如無該項憑證，即拒絕上岸。</p>
<p>上海港檢疫所吳淞分所，已於十六日恢復工作，進口船隻，如有染傳病者，一律檢驗，因最近有西雅圖來滬之二外輪，發現天花，揚子江船員，除最近已種痘者外，須均種痘。</p>
<h3>市商會電請財部　緩征本市契稅　減輕收復區人民負担</h3>
<p>上海市商會，為緩征本市契稅事，昨電財政部：「上略，本市整理契稅實施細則，係按照行政院公佈之收復區域各省縣市整理契稅辦法之規定而訂立，惟契稅為中央稅，應由直接稅局徵收，與本市土地權利之清理，</p>
<p>截然兩事茲地政局以與第一次土地所有權登記同時舉辦，易使人民發生誤解，且登記費與稅率較高之契稅，同時繳付，在本市淪陷期內成立之契據，如依偽幣計值，其應納契稅，更應照地政局估定價格征收，最高達三十年僞地政局估定價格之二百倍，尤使人民望而卻步。自上年十一月十九日地政局開始辦理土地登記以來，聲請登記者，不甚踴躍，此為一</p>
<p>最大原因是本市土地登記，反因地政局執行整理契稅實施細則，而橫生窒碍，證明各省市地政施行程序大綱第二十二條規定，「在登記期間，未稅白契，應准緩期報稅，并免予處罰」，及本市處理永租契或道契土地登記暫行辦法第七條之規定，其注意純在減輕人民担負，以促進地政實施程序之完成。是從獎勵土地登記之觀點，本市契稅，以</p>
<p>不予征收為宜。復查政府為體恤人民戰時經濟痛苦，曾明令轄免卅四年地價稅田賦一年，土地法上之目的，當無不可一併轄免之理。綜上所述（一）為減輕收復區人民納稅負擔，（二）為兼顧上海地產已商品化，若經凍結，將使金融界發生嚴重問題，（三）為使土地登記程式敏捷，及排除人民不必要之顧慮，（四）為符合轄免土地稅田賦之原意，應請鈞部俯賜鍳核，准予諮行市政府，令知本市地政局將契稅從緩征收。下略」。</p>
<h3>中國文化服務社　設資料供應部</h3>
<p>本市福州路六七九號中國文化服務社為便利個人及機關之搜蒐資料，特設「資料供應部」，剪貼報章雜誌之現代資料，經常供應。此舉在中國尚屬創舉，委託者頗為踴躍。</p>
<h3>杭記者團今離滬</h3>
<p>杭市記者訊問團，抵滬已七日，連日拜訪黨政軍首長，各報社，及日僑管理處等機構。湯司令官昨日特假康樂酒家設宴招待。茲悉，該團在任務完畢，定今日返杭。</p>
<h3>南方劇場軍警衝突案　嚴懲肇禍士兵</h3>
<p>（本報訊）十九日晚九時許南市蓬萊市場南方劇場軍警發生衝突案，當局甚為重視。軍委會副參謀總長白崇禧軍風紀巡察團團長張貞等曾親往會勘，據悉：肇禍之士兵十八名及隊長一名，現一併扣留，依法嚴懲。至受傷之交通警劉守明子彈業已設法箝出，經打針施治，神志尚清，惟險境尚未脫離。昨日市警局余副局長偕蓬萊分局陸分局長親往醫院慰問，并給予法幣一萬元，至已死之保安隊士兵邵甘潘徐志榮兩名警局方面將定期開會追悼。</p>
<h3>新六軍十四師健兒　分三批開東北　龍師長招待新聞記者　本報記者邁天</h3>
<p>「新六軍十四師到上海已經有三個月了，這次奉命開調東北，即蒙新聞界人士來歡送，十四師每一官兵感激萬分。特別是負起了中央所賦予的責任，將格外努力來報答各位的厚意。我們在此三個月中，兵士難免有忽略之處，官長也不無管理欠週之責，希望各位多多原諒指導，使軍隊與民眾能打成一片，本人內心是非常感謝的。我們是國家的軍隊，一定要做到保護民眾的責任」。十四師師長龍天武這一篇熱忱致詞，使我們感到無限的興奮和感動。</p>
<p>屢挫頑敵　戰績彪炳</p>
<p>昨日下午二時半，徐家匯楓林橋中山醫院舊址，十四師司令部的會客室裏，擠滿了五十多個記者和官長，那種熱鬧融合的空氣，是勝利後歷次記者會所僅見的。</p>
<p>十四師有着十幾年悠久的歷史，在抗戰中建過偉大的功績。密支那一役，十四師的官兵作壯烈犧牲，為國盡忠達四五千人。他們到過印度·緬甸·及中國西南及中部各地。這次經英軍協助最新裝配後，這十四師就改稱為新十四師。</p>
<p>新六軍第一批廿二師，已於十六日開始，至十九日的四天中乘美登陸艇，分作二批出發。現在已經抵達目的地。如果港口沒有凍結情形，預定登陸地點是葫蘆島，路程是四天，要是風平浪靜的話。</p>
<p>分批運輸　秩序井然</p>
<p>十四師這次要分三批開拔。第一批五千多人，分乘六船，每船約可載七百至九百人。昨天已經上船，今晨即可出發。昨天上船時還有美海軍將官及美議員三人在公和祥碼頭參觀。在美軍督導之下，他們的運輸情形，完全是有規律，有秩序的。譬如二十日早晨八時至廿一日早晨八時，這廿四小時內完全運武器彈藥，第二日廿四小時內運行李及隨身武器，第三日廿四小時內則完全運兵和隨帶的行李，士兵們上船之前，還舉行消毒預防注射等。他們在船上所吃的是乾糧，鹹魚·，醬菜等，每船有二個煤氣鍋，每次可煮飯供六十人用，所以在船就得整天開飯。第二批運的是司令部人員，定廿五日上船。這次三批都是戰略部隊，其他如長沙一帶車輛及驢馬尚待絡續運往。</p>
<p>五女同志　隨軍服務</p>
<p>十四師內有政工隊員二十人，其中有五位是女同志，她們也穿着軍裝，這次也要出發。她們現在的大部工作是演劇看護等。這五位女同志年齡都在二十五歲以下：具有中學的程度，都是在湖南招考加入的。她們每月的薪水在一萬元左右。政治部幹事楊宗億是重慶新蜀報的記者，他們都是志願加入的。從楊幹事他們生氣勃勃的精神看來，知道他們在軍隊中是有着極大貢獻的。</p>
<p>在空場上，七八個壯士，特地穿起了皮外衣，戴了皮帽皮手套，那就是新六軍到東北後的冬裝。於是，又把攝影記者忙了一番。</p>
<p>新式裝備應有盡有</p>
<p>接着，我們又被招待到交通大學，參觀他們的最新式武器裝備，有重輕機關槍，衝鋒槍，火箭砲，迫擊砲，平射砲，槍溜彈及新型無綫電等。那些士兵們都在忙着整裝待發，所以我們沒有機會，再看到其他的設備。看到那些雄壯的將士們，相信龍師長「負起中央所賦的責任……做到保護民眾的責任，」的話，是必能成功的。我為我們的新中國慶幸，我祝那些健兒們一帆風順，為國宣勞。</p>
<h3>江鳧丸運日僑返國　在淞口外觸雷沉沒　美艦施救日人多已脫險</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕載運日俘日僑四二七九名遣歸日本之日輪江鳧丸，原定前日出口，後因時間不及，改於昨日清晨起椗。詎該輪駛出吳淞口外三十里海面，觸及漂流水雷，頓時爆炸。該輪日籍船長當即發出緊急求救電報，謂如於二小時內不得援救，全船將同遭覆沒。該電經美艦「白利華脫」號首先接到，即駛赴出事地施行援救。臨時兼上海港口司令謝灝齡告本報記者，謂該日輪所戴日俘僑，經美艦施救後，除極少數失蹤外，幸均安全。現由美艦載返楊樹浦碼頭，惟多數獲救日人，衣服盡濕，本人已向當局請示，定今晨前赴照料。又昨日繼「江鳧丸」外，尚有美國登陸艇三艘，及日輪「榮豐丸」載送日僑俘一批計八千餘人返國。</p>
<h3>美軍審訊日戰犯　定今晨正式舉行　米都頓將軍任首席主審官</h3>
<p>美戰犯審判委會審訊日戰犯，原定昨晨在提籃橋監獄作初次提審。但以審判庭未完全佈置就緒，將改期今晨上午十時正式舉行。</p>
<p>戒備森嚴</p>
<p>全監獄之戰犯均被嚴密看完，樓高六層之監獄，門禁森嚴，四週圍以石壁與鐵閘。各犯均被困禁室內，除執有鐵鎖之憲兵來往走廊巡視外，　無人聲。與殺害美飛行員案有關之日人，心緒頗為撩亂，見人時面部毫無半點表情，彼等之生死權，即操在各美軍審判官手中。在兩三星期內，即可以予吾人以「殺人者死」之回答。</p>
<p>依法審判</p>
<p>美陸軍總部昨日宣佈，美戰犯審判委會，已定今日上午十時，正式在提籃橋監獄法庭，初次提審日本戰犯。第一案將提審在漢口殺害美飛行人員之日軍主犯七人，及有關人員十一人，計共十八人。美軍已推定前美幹訓團總司令，美軍撇退服務團團長，現美軍軍需處司令米都頓將軍為首席主審官，其他審判官，則有史冰克上校，奥斯特上校，迦度上校，米撒中校。原告辯論官為韋斯中校，而由加蘭德上尉副之。被告辯論官有克金斯中校，而由賴維爾上尉副之。一切將依據法律條文，及事端真偽而判決。該等日俘被告之原因為：「一九四四年十二月十六日，以殘酷的非人道的手段，害死美國飛行員，有違國際公法。被殺害之美飛行員真正姓名尚未查出，但已有綫索調查。審判之日，美空軍上尉羅尼遜，將出庭作證，並有不少美軍參加旁聽。」</p>
<h3>義律師丹尼　查明無罪獲釋</h3>
<p>〔合眾社訊〕中國戰區司令部今日宣佈：義國律師丹尼被控戰爭罪犯，經美陸軍當局詳細審訊後，查明無罪，已於昨立誓獲釋。</p>
<h3>朝鮮軍政府代表　協助撤退韓僑</h3>
<p>〔合眾社訊〕美陸軍遣送組主任維德門上校稱：朝鮮美國軍政府正式代表，將被派來華協助遣送朝鮮國民之返國工作。維氏最近在東京與美國當局進行商議結果，對於在上海區撤退朝鮮人四千人，以後在華北區撤退朝鮮人六千人之工作，已準備就緒。渠稱：「吾人曾要求軍政府負責撤退之朝鮮人，以真正貧困者為限，凡因政治或其他私人目的而欲返國者。不得搭乘美國船隻。吾人已接獲通知，謂朝鮮人兩名與美國代表一名，將被派來華負責大部份之策劃工作。</p>
<h3>閘北水電供應　正積極整頓中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北水電公司，戰前在閘北軍工路設有自來水厰及發電厰各一所，供應水電範圍，廣及閘北·吳淞·大場·羅店等區。嗣以八一三滬戰爆發，該厰厰址及水電設備，盡在戰區。除水電兩厰被炸毀損外，其他如水管電綫電桿等設備，損壞尤甚。該公司自勝利後，曾積極搜羅各項器材，勤加修理。無如一般材料，仍感缺乏，故修理工作進行，不無影響。預計發電工作，尚須再延擱數月，方有端倪。目前該公司自來水之供應，尚免能維持用戶之需。供電來源，暫時係向上海電力公司備電，故該公司對外界申請復水復電之要求，頗有力不從心之苦。最近該公司雖獲得四聯總處貸款二萬萬元，仍感不敷應用。亟望政府能予以人力及物力之援助，目前該公司水電收入，尚勉可維持成本，惟電費收入，測常遭虧蝕云。</p>

<h3>招商局向美　訂購海輪十艘　下月杪可望駛華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據國營招商局總經理徐學禹語記者稱：該公司於接勝利號輪等外，復向美國另購「N3」式之海船十艘，每隻噸位約三千噸，該項船隻，均在一九四四年先後造就，下月抄可望駛華，該局局擬就是批海船，派駛南北洋綫及台灣等，惟該項船隻，均係貨船，客位缺乏，故決另造客船兩艘，每艘約重二千噸，專事行駛長江，刻該局已着手設計打樣，不久即可交江南造船厰承造，該局最近復計劃向美國購買三艘（多屬挪威船），每艘約重二千噸，向丹麥購買五艘，每艘約重六千噸。</p>

<h3>烚赤缺乏特殊刺激　市况初疲後穩　美鈔徽挫港票略升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨不脫老調，大戶脫金換股，盲從散戶繼續斬多，惟因後市有隔日交割劇之力，依然前日作風，午刻最疲，結果又形穩定，缺乏特殊刺激，趨勢亦甚平庸，晨開平平，開後在八九萬左右盤旋，近午始見多方恐慌，籌碼本因套賣而鬆，午刻遂跌至八七萬七，後市初時尚平，迨隔日交割者逢低稍起實風，直至小市塲教市，已告回升至八九萬光景，結果較前收微挫一千，銀樓飾金掛九萬五，紋銀七百五，銀元四百六左右，暗拆仍見緊張，患價約九分至一角二分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔受套頭支持，出金換鈔者頗多，惟川帮某實業公司現貨湧出不少，因而隨金價而同趨小挫，午後金市得期貨助力，稍有回好，美鈔因係實收實解，仍在午刻價站住，結果遂較前收微挫四元，港票漸形穩定，老貨收價微升二元，成交有限，新票一度置意較濃，（一）字頭曾升至七五元左右，（二）字頭七三元，惟買戶欠　，午後略有回小，結果較前收稍升一元，澳鎊買價三千五，羅比三百元，賣價照加一成，惟羅比大額票無銷路。</p>
<h3>大戶出力拉抬　華股再接再厲</h3>
<p>華股初開承前日午後餘風，狂抬殊力，廣帮陸續放出永紗，套轉永安公司，以致公司自九百元左右一再步漲至一一五〇元以上，其他大小熱門，大戶逢高有一部份出籠，午刻遂呈浮多爭殺局面，永紗自一八〇〇元（此價已達到五百股換黃金十兩之預定目標）退至一六二〇元，美亞自一一六〇元退至九九〇元，新光景福自八五元退至七八元，中紡自七八〇元退至七〇〇元，惟在午後散市一刹那間，大戶猛力拉抬，永紗又復恢復舊觀，三小熱則以時間及資力所限，回好較少，午收結果較之前收計永紗好八十元，美亞小十元，三小熱略見上升，公司則漲起三百元，午後喊價在大戶做手下，仍有進展。</p>
<p>外股仍受華股游資所鼓勵，買戶股勤，中小型股續有進展，巨型股則較不普遍，未見興奮，午收結果較前收中小型再升少許，巨型則會德豐微挫，怡紗微升。</p>
<h3>公債再跌</h3>
<p>公債平庸萬分，散多繼續殺出，再見下游，惟丙種逢低有業中空戶補進，低後易見回風，結果丙種尚小三十元，雜牌因缺少投機性，甲乙各跌一百元，丁種一百二十元，戊種僅降七十元。</p>
<p>棉布市勞轉定，躉批交易已不易多　，低檔坯細布熱補細布根子，略見堅硬，但亦一時權宜之計，無多成交，客帮有作歸計，故市塲亦鮮踪跡，趨勢大約可平穩至年關。</p>
<h3>紗綫價續跌　花市略有點綴</h3>
<p>昨日紗市依然不振，同行仍多不惜貶低求賣，客銷不見起色，致各支紗綫又降二萬，獨廿支金橋紗價五十七萬，屹然未動，緣有漢客指定要求此牌，而廠方居奇，扳牢原價，致價未降落，紡建開價朱變，買戶　稀少，緣業中人已買談公司各日廠老牌紗綫，非但日見虧累，且出貨時遭遇留難，是以威裏足不前云。</p>
<p>現棉市况仍平，廠商尚祇點綴交易，華廠進四十二支原料美棉米得林花價八萬五千元，三十二支原料大中集花價八萬元，以上均送廠價，花號進二十支原料通州花價六萬六千元，十支原料餘姚花價五萬元，以上均棧交價，碼頭上未聞到貨云。</p>
<h3>綢廠原料配給　人造絲價銳跌</h3>
<p>廠經屹立綢貨疲軟</p>
<p>人造絲原料配給綢廠之說，已經證實，昨市現貨頓形疲落，一二〇號天橋開盤一百十八萬元，旋又降至一百十一萬元，成交寥寥，收盤一百〇七萬元，進銳退亦連，午後人心略　，做一百十二萬元，較上日小二十萬元，機學開盤七十九萬元。　離現貨建三十入九萬元之　，故一坤逐　有人，價遂給高做入十四萬元，廠經價仍屹立未動，頗　堅賺之象，綱貨一致渡軟，交易甚稀，昨市計做開美亞被面每百條七十三萬元，大　格　　每碼二千二百廿元，民生織錦緞每件一萬〇五百元。</p>
<h3>英美行家問津　茶商無貨應市　綠茶客銷極旺</h3>
<p>（本報訊）茲據茶業界透露消息，日來本市英美商洋行屢接到國外來電稱，對於平水珠茶及祁門茶，需求甚亟，均擬預訂定貨，而本市茶商鑒於目前一時不易覓取相當數量之茶葉原料，是以猶鮮切實答覆，大致須待明春方可發動。</p>
<p>邇來客帮對於紅綠茶花色，需求甚爲股切，且其中尤以綠茶爲最，若天津·營口等地，幾抱來者不拒之勢，致價格方面日趨高漲不已，大有漫無止境之概，至於紅茶雖問津者較綠茶爲少，行情穩定乏變，然底盤則屬鞏固。</p>
<h3>洋酒增稅六成</h3>
<p>政府當局頃宣佈所有洋酒，均須徵收酒類統稅百分之六十，自土釀俄國酒至進口之蘇格蘭威士忌酒爲止，一概不能豁免，查本地釀造之酒由釀造廠商繳納，外洋進口之酒，由洋酒什售商繳納，此種黴稅方法之理由，實因在市面用戶方面徵收，十分困難，且易漏稅，故自近日起，各種洋酒一律增加百分之六十，以資應付，此種統稅，酒瓶上亦將有印花票黏貼，以示稅已付訖。</p>
<h3>糧辦處拋售蕪秈　米市漲風稍定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米價因到貨較少，本街納胃甚旺，趁連日上升之勢，價復高漲，開盤時厚粳達一萬零五百元，買多賣少，仍有漲象，本市糧政辦公處以漲勢太猛，拋出大批蕉秞，先開八千五百元，未有成交，逐步降至七千五百元，成交約萬石左右，本街均有吸進，影響厚粳薄稻不得不反漲爲疲，計粳米回小二三百元，早薄稻下跌四五百元，秈米小五六百元，白元亦小二三百元，油市到消兩旺，續升數百元，黃豆胃呆，價小一二百元，市少成交，豆餅疲而不開，麵粉交易轉懈，加小一二百元，酒市年消頗活，價再升千元。</p>
<h3>刦餘紗布發還之法理觀</h3>
<p>敵僞刧餘之紗布，實爲一種贜物，其已被非法處分部份，一時不能物歸原主，有待於將來要求賠償外，所餘之一部，自應發還原主，決不能因原物不能辨認，即將餘剩之贜物，全部沒收。因紗布之牌號名稱，雖各有異同，然皆得以同種類同數量或同品質之物，比例為之攤還也。</p>
<p>至於敵偽刧取紗布之時，雖經給付一部之價金，然其數甚微，以之賠償整個之損失，尚不及原値百分之一二，論理自不能以當時被迫收受之些微價金，即總爲已有對待給付，不能再有發還之請求。縱使依法而論，認爲當時紗希商人所受之價金，無異一種敵產，則於發還剩餘刧物以後，使紗布商人比照繳還，由國家予以沒收，或爲紗布商人之所顧也。</p>
<p>總之，敵僞刧餘之紗布，應予發還，於情於法，均無不當，至於如何發還之方法，則固有待於當局之審愼處理也。（王效文）</p>

<h3>山水畫作風之變遷</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>山水畫成立於晉，明帝之輕舟迅邁圖，衛協之宴瑤池圖，載達之吳中溪山邑居圖，顧愷之之雪　　五老峯圖等，皆為山水畫最早之名蹟；惟大都皆為人物畫之背景，獨顧愷之能從人物畫之背景，進步成為獨立之山水畫；因稱我國山水畫家之祖。至南北朝，山水畫更為進步，純粹獨立。且有專畫山水著名之畫家，如宗炳，王微，梁元帝等，皆有山水畫之論著。唐以後，山水畫分為南北宗，作風胚變，由粗簡而進於綢密，由沈艷而趨於淡彩，李思訓父子之青綠山水，為北宗鼻祖，王維之水墨山水，為南宗領袖。</p>
<p>五代之山水畫家，以荊浩，關　，　生為最著，得風變為高古渾厚；其他北宗畫家，亦受南宗水墨畫之影響，漸趨同化。故在梁，唐，晉，漢，周，五十年中，純粹之北宗畫家甚少。北宋之畫源，李成，范寬等，皆以為宗；號為北宋三大家。惟作風則各有不同，畫源以水墨為尚，喜寫江南　山，巨然師之，李成惜墨如金，好寫平遠寒林，雪景尤為特出。許道寗，郭熙等，皆出其門，范寬喜作崇岡密林，用畢深重，物象幽雅，此外米元章遠倣王洽，近師畫源，滿紙琳璃，別成米派雲山，亦為北宋山水作風之特異者，皆南宗也，南渡以後，有趙伯駒，李唐，劉鬆年，李嵩等，蔚薈於畫院，筆尚細潤，而色主青綠，名為院體畫；實則李思訓青綠之一派也，同時院體畫中有馬遠，夏珪，皆師李唐，多用水墨，行筆粗經，不主細潤，別開蒼勁之作風，已受董范米之陶染，而舍南北二宗為一道，山水畫至此，乃又為一變</p>
<p>元初之山水畫，除少數如錢舜舉等，承繼南宋院體以外，趙鬆雪以細潤著名，而以簡率出之，高克恭，曹智白，及元季四家之黃公　，王蒙，倪瓚，是鎮等作風，雖少有差異，要不出南宗之範圍，崇尚簡淡清潤之風。入明則山水畫，分派甚多，其最著者有浙派，院派，吳派三派，如載進，雙馬遠夏珪之作風，而成為浙派，吳偉，沈周，實為此中健將。院派則周臣，唐寅，冷　等皆兼擅青綠，用筆校浙派為細巧縝密，柔淡雅秀。吳派則宗王維以降，荊關，董巨，李，米，趙，高，以及元季四家者，多為吳人，遂稱吳派；如董其昌，陳繼儒，謝時臣，李日華，等數十人，作風秀逸，較之浙派，院派，乃別具風格也。</p>
<p>自清以來，山水畫作風，並無特殊之變遷，亦無若何之進步，大體作風，皆以南宗為依歸，惟支流紛歧，派別甚多。四王吳惲，為此中翹楚，其傳習董源米氏，用筆較濕，用墨較潤者，則歸董其昌，曰華亭派。用筆務枯，用墨務乾，傳雲林者，則稱釋宏仕，曰新安派。用筆鬆秀，設色溫厚，傳習董源者，則歸趙文度，曰松江派。此外，宗蕭雲從者，為姑熟派；歸羅牧者，為江人成社，因地立派之勢，而作風皆同係南宗，出入於董巨米高以及元四家中，無甚軒輊。其不入諸派，筆意奇姿，作風奔放，卓然成家，別樹一幟者，有石濤，石溪，八大山人等，此外復有畫中九友，金陵八家，揚州八怪，畫中十哲，昆陵六逸等稱謂，亦各有可取。</p>
<h3>凌廷堪論曲絕句疏證（中）</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>天子朝門撮合新，</p>
<p>後園高弔榜頭人。</p>
<p>青衫淚與金錢記，</p>
<p>祗許臨川步後塵。</p>
<p>原註云：「元宵衫淚朝門勅配，金錢記弔拷韓翃，皆湯臨川之粉本也。」按，青衫淚乃馬致達作，金錢記乃喬吉作。湯臨川，即湯顯祖，指他的「牡丹亭」摹仿元曲。摹仿金錢的是第五十二名句「硬拷」，此句至今尚有人能唱；摹仿青衫淚的是宋句：「杜安撫以柳生之事伏奏皇上，柳生亦上一本分辨，兩人在闕下爭是非。麗娘親自登朝，託陳黃門啓奏自己再生的經過。天子取照膽鏡檢定麗娘是人是鬼，並詢問其亡前亡後之事，結果再生無　，於是父子夫婦相認，奉旨成親，全家團圓。」牡丹亭故事來源，張友鸞「湯顯祖及其牡丹亭」言之甚詳，惟受青衫記的景程，還不曾有人指出過。</p>
<p>妙手新繅五色絲，</p>
<p>繍來花樣各爭奇。</p>
<p>誰知白地光明錦，</p>
<p>卻讓陳州糶米詞。</p>
<p>以詞藻勝者頗多。但白描工夫（即本色派）究不能不推無名氏的「陳州糶米」。我好像記得，此劇作者也是有主名的。天一閣本錄鬼簿似乎說作者叫陸登善。凌氏推崇此劇，當是他個人的私見。</p>
<p>仲宣忽作中郎婿，</p>
<p>斐度曾為白相翁。</p>
<p>若使硁硁徵史傳，</p>
<p>元人格律逐飛篷。</p>
<p>原註云：「元人雜劇事實多與史傳乖迕，明其為覷也。後人不知，妄生穿　，陋矣。」這說明了作者對於無雜劇不合正史的態度，他認為這正是無雜劇的特色之一，牠本是野生的藝術，不必硁硁於正史的。以下還有好幾首都發揮同樣的意見。第一句指的是鄭光祖的「醉思鄉王粲登樓」，最後寫王粲與蔡邕之女結婚。第二句指的是鄭光祖的「梅香騙翰林風月」。　子末云：「小生姓白，雙名敏中，乃白樂天之弟。先父曾與晉公裴度，征討淮西。晉公道：某有一女，小字小蠻，與你令嗣敏中為妻。」</p>
<p>比士剖心鮑吉甫，</p>
<p>元奘拜佛吳昌齡。</p>
<p>摘星樓曁唐三藏，</p>
<p>莫笑　言都不經。</p>
<p>此首立意與上同。鮑吉甫作有「摘星樓比士剖心」，這對於明許仲琳的封神演義當有影響，被許仲琳採作封神材料的一部分。吳昌齡作有「西遊記」，有世界文庫本，元人雜劇全集本，　谷溫影印本等。</p>
<p>博望燒屯亮葛才，</p>
<p>隔江鬥智玳宴開。</p>
<p>至今委巷談三國，</p>
<p>都自元人曲子來。</p>
<p>「諸葛亮博望燒屯」，「兩軍師隔江鬥智」：二種均無名氏作，俱見於元曲選·三國志的演化，胡適文存中攷證最詳·後來孫楷第也有專文攷訂，最精·大約元曲與三國志平話最為接近·委巷所談的羅貫中三國演義，與元曲已經隔一層了。</p>
<p>是真是戲妄參詳，</p>
<p>撼樹蚍蜉不自量。</p>
<p>信否東都包待制，</p>
<p>金牌智斬魯肅郎。</p>
<p>原註云：「元人關月，往往有極無理可笑者，著其體例如此·近之作者乃以無隙可指為貴，於是彌縫愈工，去之愈遠·」這話是頗能得到元曲神髓的。元曲「文章在，光燄萬丈長·蚍蜉撼大樹，可笑不自量」·評李杜的話可以移用在這兒·「包待制智斬魯肅郎」，元曲選題為關漢卿作：惟錄鬼簿正音譜均未著錄，也是園書目謂為無名氏作·是否關作，頗有疑問·但從關作「錢大尹智寵謝天香」，「杜蕊娘智賞金線池」，「錢大尹勘緋衣蘿」等愛用「智」字看來，或許是關作的，也未可知。</p>
<p>傳奇作祖施君美，</p>
<p>散曲嗣音陳大聲。</p>
<p>待到故明中葉後，</p>
<p>吾家詞客有初成。</p>
<p>前面我已說過，傳奇的祖先該是宋代的戲文「王愌」「王魁」之類，而不是元代施惠（君美）的拜月亭·大約凌氏長於曲律，昧於曲史，所以說到曲史，常不免有錯誤的地方·明季金陵陳大聲所作散曲，廬前的飲虹　叢書中印過兩種·但南宮詞紀，雍熙樂府，吳騷合編等書中尚有二書所未收的散曲頗多，約三四十套·倘若　集起來，當成為很的一冊·任訥和凌景埏都曾做過這個工作，惜未出書·初成即凌初成，他的「虬髯翁」有盛明雜劇二集本·他的「北紅拂」新近也有影印本，這是換一個人為主角來寫虬髯客傳的。風塵三俠，他用三個人主唱，各寫一本；另一本至今還不曾找到·他對於通俗文學頗為盡力·拍案驚奇初二刻就是他編的·所謂元刊本的琵琶記（有蟬隱蘆影印本）大約就是他的託古改制·從這部書裏，看出他鈎稽曲譜中的古琵琶記，頗為盡力·在琵琶記跋文裏，知道他還根據元曲「舍汁衫」寫過一部傳奇。</p>
<p>弇州碧管傳鳴鳳，</p>
<p>少白烏絲述浣紗。</p>
<p>事必求真文必麗，</p>
<p>誤將剪綵當春花。</p>
<p>凌氏已經屢次說過戲劇不必一定要合於歷史，現在又重新申說一遍。他在這首詩裏主張自然，反對堆砌雕琢，我極同意。他說：王世貞（弇）寫鳴鳳記傳奇，事事求真；梁辰魚（少白）寫浣紗記傳奇，句句求麗：這兩種態度都是不對的。結果求真未必真，求麗也未必麗。反不及假的倒像是真的，俗的倒像是麗的。求真和麗，結果成為沒有生氣的紙剪的花朶；不及春天大自然的花朶，漫山遍野都是，牠不假修飾，卻有自然的風趣。</p>
<p>四聲猿後古音乖，</p>
<p>接踵還魂復紫釵。</p>
<p>一自青藤開別派，</p>
<p>更誰樂府繼誠蕭？</p>
<p>徐謂，這位青　書屋主人，他的四聲猿，據凌氏說，是有乖音律的。湯顯祖的牡丹亭和紫釵記，拗折天下人的嗓子，卻是事實。但較早的朱有燉的誠蕭樂府，卻並不能遵守元人的曲律，他打破了一折一人唱和每本四折等例。</p>
<p>玉茗堂前暮復朝，</p>
<p>葫蘆怕仿昔人描。</p>
<p>癡兒不識邯鄲步，</p>
<p>苦學王家雪裏蕉。</p>
<p>玉茗堂主人湯顯祖說：「吾意所至，不妨拗折天下人嗓子。」這意思是說：寧可曲律就吾意，不願吾意就曲律。可見湯顯祖是不願依樣畫葫蘆，而是獨創局面的。一般人不懂得，反去邯鄲學步，那末真如湯氏所譏笑似的「縱然割裂時人景，卻愧王維舊雪圖」了。</p>
<p>句齒聲戶各鬥妍，</p>
<p>粲花開出小乘禪。</p>
<p>鼎中自有神丹在，</p>
<p>但偋吞刀未是仙。</p>
<p>此詩對於「粲花五種」的作者吳炳頗含貶意。說他還不能練神丹，只能吞九吐火；還只能參淺陋的小乘禪，未足與語深湛的大乘禪。意思彷彿說吳炳大紅大綠塗抹得太厲害，只顧織秾，結果只成為宋登徒子好色賦中所寫的那個句齒的登徒子妻，和效顰的東施罷了。吳炳專學湯顯祖，上一首恐怕也是暗罵吳炳的吧？</p>

<h3>重至滬上有感</h3>
<p>— 許君武</p>
<p>飆輪謝客止江十，如獲還珠攜帶塵歡。去日心情隨夢　；參天海氣擁燈寒。為聲　雀寧無悔？與虎謀皮始覺　。樓息伶　成苦笑，一枝誰　杜陵安！</p>
<p>筆春底秋</p>
<h3>縮腳語</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>多人罵「官樣文章」，我對它別有解釋。</p>
<p>就字義說，「官樣文章」該是指那公文的程式。「等因」「奉此」雖也有人對他頭痛，但是細按它的組織卻完密得很有道理。倘使遇着有案可稽的案件。倘使辦案的人認真查看案卷，那真可立見責任分明。惟其如此，所以前清官員才要供養「師爺」。「師爺」的高明之處全在於技巧的能夠減輕或脫卸他主人的責任，因此，「官樣文章」理應是官家頭痛之物。</p>
<p>這裏有個例：「三令五申」正是政治上的弱點。假使官家對於弱點的暴露感到頭痛的話，那好對於「三令五申」不留痕跡。然而，譬如說主席一道一道的手諭下來，下面的執行機關轉飭下屬的公文裏便得說「迭奉主席　　　手諭」。這裏面每一個　代表一個日子的手諭。有三個　便是三令，有五個　便是五申。這便是格於「官樣文章」不得不留下了「三令五申」的痕跡，這應該是官家感到頭痛的事。</p>
<p>然而，「官樣文章」卻被老百姓頭痛了。你這為何？有句俗話：「官樣文學說說罷了。」原來老百姓所頭痛的「官樣文章」是個縮腳語，指它下面縮去的四個字——「說說罷了」。</p>
<h3>寒衣之類</h3>
<p>— 汪倜然</p>
<p>天時轉冷，西北風起，讀書人的腦子裏就不免又浮起了「朱門酒肉臭」，「路有凍死骨」之類的陳腐句子來。而一到冷天，每夜在路上總得凍死若干窮人癟三，也實在是年年皆有，陳腐得很之事。對於這一類的事，大槪總是不屑一顧的人為多，即使有時在馬路上偶爾看到，也總是亟亟乎掩鼻而之的。這不能怪人之無情，也許還是因為死究竟是醜惡的，並不能引起生者之注視或興趣吧？</p>
<p>可是，話雖如此，死究竟是生之結局，能生又何致於死，旣死則自必有難生之故。這樣一想，就可知生原也是醜惡的。或許比死更醜惡吧。為了生存，為了活命，有多少人奴顏婢膝，寡廉鮮恥，不惜出賣靈魂，不惜沾辱軀體，來維持他們那醜惡的一生。他們是倖存了，然而其生也又豈不更醜惡於死？這樣一比，那些輾轉溝壑，終於釠寒路斃之輩，雖是可憐的「弱者」，倒是値得加以憫惜的了。</p>
<p>尤其是，我們一想到勝利以後，有許多人「五子登科」了，而有許多人卻是「四大皆空」，甚至困頓以死，終覺得太不忍心。這是誰對不起他們呢？為什麼沒有人救救他們呢？的確，現在待救的人太多了，慈善家是救不勝救的，但今年救濟的工作始終沒有好好地做過，也到底是事實。</p>
<p>這緣因，也許是天天在報上看到聯合國善後救濟的消息，於於大家覺得窮人儘夠有人救濟了吧。其實「善救」署裏諸公，對是救濟一道，也正在大感棘手啊。例子很多，如麵粉，雖然是又白又好的洋乾麵，卻是平民買到的真少得很，又如衣服，那更是大問題了。善救署有幾萬套的西服，原是預備分給窮苦人穿的，可是據說，分給中國的窮人穿卻不配，因為中國的窮人只宜於穿棉襖云。而借某報記者生花之筆所說，以此項西服給難民穿，真成了「洋裝癟三」云云，那更是滑稽之餘，令人啼笑皆非了。諸如此類，可見救窮實在難救。而慈善家與慈善官之都難做，自亦不在話下。</p>
<p>這樣一想，天下最麻煩的事，便可知全在中國，寒衣之類，不過一例而已。我們忝為中國人之一，除了自慚自憐之外，就別無他法。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（八）　（四）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「天哪！昨晚上作夢，夢見一隻黃鵬似的鳥兒，從我的懷裏呌着飛出去，如今這聲音，就是那鳥兒的叫的聲音呀！」</p>
<p>墨老爺簡直有些恐怖之感了！他想：該不會又是在作夢吧？他抬頭看了看窗外，正是紅日當空。他心裏疑雲一團，惶惑失措之際，墨盛又慌慌張張地跑來了</p>
<p>「恭喜老爺！如今太太添了一位千金小姐！」墨盛說罷笑嘻嘻地站在一邊。</p>
<p>「啊？」墨老爺好像沒聽清楚。</p>
<p>「爸爸！媽當真給我添了一個妹妹：」寶鈴高興得跳起來。一面拉住墨盛嚷着：「墨盛，你帶我去看看妹妹，我先頭還跟爸爸說：我喜歡妹妹。」</p>
<p>墨盛沒作聲，悄悄向墨老爺呶了呶嘴兒。寶鈴明白他的意思，也就不再言語了。</p>
<p>墨老爺又陷入了沉思中，他旣已知道剛才的聲音，是嬰兒墜地的哭聲，那麼便很快地意識到昨夜的夢，原來徵兆在這件事情上。於是他更覺得奇怪了！他想把這個奇怪的夢告訴寶鈴，可是寶鈴太小，還不能夠理解。告訴墨盛吧，墨盛究竟是一個僕人，同他講這些閒話，他怕傷了自己的尊嚴。最後，他想到翁老爺，他像得了救似的馬上吩咐墨盛：</p>
<p>「墨盛，你去看看翁老爺起來沒有？你請他過足了癮到咱們這兒來一下，就說我有事同他商量。順便請他把他們家的好酒帶來一瓶。」</p>
<p>「老爺，您不能再喝酒了！您的咳嗽……」</p>
<p>墨盛的話還沒說完，墨老爺便揮了揮手說：</p>
<p>「你不懂！你不懂！快去吧！」</p>
<p>墨盛只好答應着去了。</p>
<p>寶鈴看見墨老爺恢復了常態，便趁機求他：</p>
<p>「爸爸：我想看看妹妹去。」</p>
<p>墨老爺點了點頭。可是當寶鈴剛要抬腿走時，他又記起寶鈴的功課還沒做完，因此又制止地說：</p>
<p>「你的書還沒有背哩！」</p>
<p>「那麼，我就背了再去。」</p>
<p>寶鈴連忙又回到書案前。墨老爺看着寶鈴不像是沒讀熟的樣了。便又說：</p>
<p>「好啦！只要你已經念熟了，就明天再背吧！」</p>
<p>寶鈴聽了這一句話，如獲至寶，樂得小心眼兒開了花兒，立刻奔向外面。臨走的時候，還回頭問墨老爺。</p>
<p>「您不去看看妹妹嗎？爸爸！」</p>
<p>這一下提醒了墨老爺，他想想不錯，如今孩子生下來了，該去慰問慰問太太，不然，將來又可落藵貶，給太太責備自己：「無情無義」了。想到這裏，他便也跟着走出書房。</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Northeast Next Month; Madame Chiang Arrives in Changchun to Console the Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] Madame Chiang arrived here yesterday and, after a brief stay, proceeded to Changchun. According to a letter from Changchun, in addition to inspecting Changchun, Madame Chiang will also visit Harbin, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places. Chinese reporters in Changchun are preparing to accompany Madame Chiang on her visits to various locations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 22nd dispatch] The general consensus among Chinese newspapers here is that Madame Chiang's arrival in Changchun will bring an end to the Soviet military's occupation of the city. It is also believed that Madame Chiang will stay in the Northeast for a week and then fly to Shanghai via Beiping.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Beiping, 22nd dispatch] Madame Chiang flew to Changchun this morning from Beiping, representing the National Government to award medals to Soviet officers and soldiers in recognition of their assistance in liberating the Northeast of China. Meanwhile, according to a telegram from Changchun, Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet forces in the Northeast, is scheduled to depart from Changchun for Moscow today to participate in the final stage of the Soviet elections. The Soviet forces in the nine eastern provinces are still preparing to begin withdrawing from foreign areas starting on the 23rd of this month, and to withdraw from the nine eastern provinces by February 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd dispatch] Madame Chiang arrived in Changchun by air on the 22nd. Thirty tons of comfort supplies have already been divided into eleven aircraft and airlifted here this afternoon. In addition to consoling the Soviet troops, Madame Chiang is also here on behalf of Chairman Chiang to comfort the people of the Northeast. A portion of the comfort supplies has been shipped from Shanghai to Qinhuangdao and will soon be transported out of the customs. The program for the welcome to Madame Chiang by the Chinese and Soviet military and civilians here has been determined. The first event will be a welcome tea party hosted by the Executive Headquarters, to which senior Soviet military officers will be invited. Madame Chiang will award medals on behalf of Chairman Chiang to Soviet soldiers who have contributed to the war against Japan. Secondly, a grand reception will be held by various local circles, and the Soviet side will also have some welcoming activities.</p>
<p>Chairman Bids Farewell with Deep Emotion; Letter Addressed to Soviet Troops in China</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] The Soviet troops, who have successfully completed their mission to liberate the Northeast, will withdraw from the Northeast to their home country on February 1st. Chairman Chiang bids farewell with deep emotion and has specially sent Madame Chiang to the Northeast to comfort the Soviet troops and soldiers. He has also printed 400,000 copies of a letter addressed to the Soviet troops in China, which Madame Chiang will carry to distribute. The full text is as follows: To Marshal Rodion Malinovsky and the brave Soviet soldiers, August 9, 1945, will forever leave the most glorious memory for mankind in this Allied anti-aggression world war. In particular, we, the Chinese people, will never forget this day. Thanks to your country's declaration of war on Japan, our two countries finally obtained a most glorious opportunity to fight side by side with the Japanese aggressors, defeating the Japanese warlords in our Northeast and liberating the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast of our country from the hoofs of the aggressors after 14 years of oppression. Brave Soviet soldiers, today, in the position of Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, I represent the Chinese government and all the military and civilians to express our sincere condolences and heartfelt gratitude to you. Looking back, our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, have had a deep traditional friendship from the beginning. As early as 20 years ago, our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and your country's leader Vladimir Lenin laid a good foundation for the revolutionary cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Our two countries have long had the oath to advance hand in hand and jointly dedicate ourselves to the great cause of human liberation. I am convinced that after this unprecedented victory against aggression, only the sincere cooperation and mutual assistance between the Allied countries can consolidate world peace and achieve human progress. In particular, our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, should forever maintain the great traditional friendship of the past and continue to carry it forward, so as to forever ensure the victory we have gained and strive for lasting world peace after the war. This time, your advance into the Northeast of our country was to promote the early realization of global peace and was a coordinated action taken with China and other Allied nations. Under the great leadership of Chairman Joseph Stalin, with invincible bravery and superior equipment, coupled with the efforts of our compatriots in the Northeast, in a very short period of time, you disintegrated the enemy entrenched in the Northeast of our country, accelerating the surrender of the Japanese bandits and the restoration of the Northeast. The glorious achievements you have established will forever be remembered by our compatriots throughout the country. Now that the mission of your army in the Northeast of our country is about to be completed and you are about to return to your country, I have specially sent Madame Chiang to express my sincere condolences and respect for the farewell, and I wish you boundless progress under the leadership of Chairman Stalin, and I wish you happiness. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference Postponed for Three Days; Comprehensive Group to Be Established Soon; Chairman Chiang to Host All Representatives Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference's group meeting did not take place on the 21st. The National Assembly, the Constitutional Draft Outline, and three other groups continued their discussions on the 22nd, and the Equal Status group joined as well. However, opinions from all sides still differ, so the conference is bound to be postponed again. All members are busy with group negotiations and rarely reveal information. From the Comprehensive Group's indirect sources and general speculation, the difficulty lies in: A. Many of the issues in each group are interconnected and cannot be resolved separately. Therefore, the comprehensive group proposed by Zhang Lisheng will inevitably be established to summarize and seek possible conclusions. B. Regarding military issues, negotiations cannot proceed and an agreement cannot be reached until a three-person group, including advisors who have returned to Chongqing, discusses various technical issues to seek a concrete plan for the reorganization of the Communist army. To date, the CCP still insists that the nationalization of the army and political democratization should proceed simultaneously, while the government believes that national unity and stability can only be guaranteed after the nationalization of the army, which can then ensure genuine democracy. C. Regarding the issue of old representatives to the National Assembly, the CCP and the Democratic League still insist on not recognizing them. However, from various signs, this issue can be resolved from the overall issue after the Comprehensive Group begins its work.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] Chairman Chiang will host all representatives of the Political Consultative Conference at the National Government Auditorium on the evening of the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to close on the 23rd, but as negotiations have not yet been completed, the Chairman of the National Government has decided to postpone it for three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The military group, the government reorganization group, the policy outline group, and the constitutional draft group of the Political Consultative Conference's subcommittees held meetings at the National Government this afternoon to reach partial agreements on various issues, and will continue negotiations tomorrow. In addition, the Comprehensive Group will also be established soon. Representatives from all sides have been invited to be nominated, and a meeting is scheduled for 4:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Chairman Chiang Meet to Discuss Ways to Stop Conflict; Supervisory Groups Sent to Xuzhou and Hancheng</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast, General Marshall announced: He went to Shanghai last weekend, his main task being to dispatch ceasefire supervisory groups to Xuzhou and Hancheng. Two teams of supervisory groups flew to their destinations on Sunday. Each team includes one representative each from the National Government, the Communist Party, and the US military.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] Ambassador Walter and General Marshall met with Chairman Chiang for an hour today. It is widely believed that they discussed various methods to stop the continued occurrence of violations of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Beiping, 22nd dispatch] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters announced today that the headquarters received a request from the Communist Party and has dispatched a team from Shanghai to Guangzhou to enforce the ceasefire order. Other teams have safely arrived in Chifeng, Jining, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, and Xuzhou. Although headquarters has received reports from each team, there is no confirmed news as to whether the fighting has completely stopped in places where the war is still going on. The headquarters also announced that the mobile investigation team sent to the Jinan area to issue ceasefire orders is progressing very smoothly. According to a telegram report from American team member Colonel Lake, the team has met with senior military officers from both the Nationalists and the Communists several times in Tai'an. The two sides have now agreed to immediately cease the conflict, release prisoners, and repair the local railway. The team will soon proceed to Zhangdian, where conflicts are reported to be still occurring.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference today elected eight representatives to participate in the military investigation team to investigate the implementation of the ceasefire situation in various places. Together with the eight previously elected, there are a total of sixteen people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st dispatch] Zhou Binglin, professor of the National Southwest Associated University, resident member of the Political Participation Council, and member of the military inspection team elected by the Political Consultative Conference, arrived in Chongqing from Kunming the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 21st dispatch] The Northeast Security Command Headquarters issued a public notice on the 21st stating that the National Army has stopped conflicts in compliance with the ceasefire order and strictly ordered frontline troops not to fire a single shot. However, the Communist forces in the Rehe territory have been actively blockading all sides, which is even more active than before. (1) Lingyuan Nanjianchang has increased the Communist army by more than 5,000 people, besieging our Jianchang garrison. (2) About 10,000 Communist troops are gradually approaching our garrison 50 li northwest of Lingyuan. (3) Tianyi Railway Station has been occupied by the Communist army. (4) The Communist army in Dacheng south of Yebaishou has increased by about 2,000 to 3,000 people in January.</p>

<h3>President Song Meets with Reporters in Shanghai; Flies to Nanjing Today and Transfers to Guangzhou for Inspection; Government Resolves to Seek Sound Development of Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] After arriving in Shanghai, President Song is reportedly scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 23rd, then fly to Guangzhou for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper report] In the "new," "fast," and "practical" construction of the country, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, frankly explained the government's basic policies on supporting China's textile and silk industries and the policy of strengthening the use of ships during the recovery period at a reception for reporters yesterday. What Premier Song clarified was: "Since the government has established an economic policy of separating light industry from private operation, why has it organized the state-run China Textile Construction Corporation and the China Silk Corporation?" In addition, Premier Song also explained the importance of strengthening the allocation of ships and the government's measures to establish a sound sea and river shipping institution.</p>
<p>Premier Song has come to Shanghai three times after the victory. The reception held in the Bank of China Building yesterday was Song's first "group" meeting with reporters after returning to China, and it was also the first time he met with reporters in Shanghai after the victory. At the reception, due to time constraints, the questions raised by the reporters were limited to the three issues of textiles, silk, and shipping. A summary of Song's remarks: (1) The significance of the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation (see separate written remarks).</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the shortage of ships to cope with the recovery and construction period, President Song said: The government has organized a ship allocation committee to use a small number of ships to cope with a huge need. At the same time, it is using various methods to purchase ships from foreign countries so that coastal and inland river transportation can gradually become smooth. It has purchased 15 old ships from the Philippines and ordered 10 new ships from the United States. In addition, in order to quickly solve the shipping problem, it has leased ships from Jardine Matheson and Taikoo to transport relief supplies from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In order to reflect the real situation, the government has approved these two companies to temporarily fly the British flag and sail on our coast and inland rivers. Although the abolition of unequal treaties does not allow foreign ships to sail on our coast and inland rivers, this measure is temporary. It is actually beneficial to our country and does not damage our overall sovereignty. Song also had great expectations for the future development of our country's shipping industry. He said: The government will have the ability to concentrate economic power in the future to gradually enrich the total number of our country's ships. President Song mentioned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) were established at the same time, but our country failed to develop the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company due to mismanagement, while the NYK Line has become a huge shipping institution in the world, which is deeply regrettable. Song said: Although the current situation is difficult, if we can work realistically in two or three years, we will definitely achieve the ideal goal and surpass the pre-war achievements of the NYK Line.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the China Silk Corporation, the government also feels that 70% of China's silk industry has been destroyed during the war. Before the war, our country's silk industry did not seek progress in technology, and the quality of silk varied, and there was no fixed standard for the selling price in foreign markets, so it could not compete with Japan's raw silk export industry. The foreign raw silk market is mostly controlled by the Japanese. The government's initial organization of the silk industry company was based on promoting the spirit, and it specially hired silk industry expert Ge Jingzhong to preside over it, hoping to make an overall development plan for our country's silk industry. The government now plans to recover 5 million mulberry saplings from Japan and compensate for a large number of silkworms in order to restore our silk production industry. The organization of the China Silk Corporation is also transitional, with a term of two years, and at most it will be extended for one year before being transferred to private operation.</p>
<p>Song also introduced Mr. Ge Jingzhong to stand up and give a speech. Mr. Wan said briefly: The status of our country's silk industry in the international market has been seized by the Japanese, and we must take it back from the Japanese in the future. Before the war, Japan sold nearly 800,000 dans abroad annually, and the foreign exchange it earned was also the capital for its aggressive policies. The destruction of our country's mulberry fields and silk industry by the Japanese army in the past was planned. They wanted to destroy our country's entire silk industry and prevent China from becoming a silk-producing country again.</p>
<p>At the reception, a reporter asked: In the recovered areas, the enemy and puppets had forcibly collected a large amount of yarn and cloth from people during the occupation period. Should this yarn and cloth be returned? President Song replied: This is a legal issue, and it will be handled fairly after research. Another reporter asked: It is said that there is a black market for passenger and cargo transportation on various Yangtze River ships. Can the government take effective measures to eliminate this malpractice? Premier Song replied: This malpractice should of course be eliminated, but the current lack of ships makes it difficult to eradicate even if it is banned. The malpractice will be reduced as soon as the ships ordered from foreign countries arrive. Another reporter asked: Can we negotiate with foreign shipping companies to fly our national flag when sailing on our coast and inland rivers in order to respect sovereignty and correct the view? Song said: The borrowing of foreign ships this time is entirely to meet the needs of reality. We cannot ignore the problems of reality. Fortunately, our use of foreign ships is temporary. I hope we can endure it for the time being. Those who attended the reception yesterday included Peng Xuepei, director of the Executive Yuan's temporary office in Shanghai, Shu Yunzhang, general manager of China Textile Construction Corporation, Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, and more than 30 reporters.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday; Appointment of Dalian Reception Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Executive Yuan held its 730th regular meeting on the 22nd of this month, chaired by Vice President Weng.

<h3>Beijing-Wuhu Railway to Be Dismantled Section by Section; Technicians Depart, Completion in One Month</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] The transportation authorities have recently decided to dismantle the Beijing-Wuhu Railway section by section to rush repair the Jinpu Railway, which was destroyed by the Communist army. Zhou Dingting, deputy manager of the Jiangnan Railway Bureau, led a large number of technical personnel to Wuhu yesterday. The dismantling work will begin in Wuhu on the 22nd. However, in order to maintain transportation, it was decided to dismantle section by section and stop the train section by section. The undemolished sections will continue to operate as usual. This work is expected to be completed in one month, while reconstruction will take three months.</p>
<h3>Personnel of Rehe Provincial Government Gather in Chaoyang; Large Numbers of National Army Troops Are Heading to the Northeast in Different Routes</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] Liu Duoqi, chairman of Rehe, is temporarily promoting provincial administration in Chaoyang. Personnel of the Rehe Provincial Government who remained in Beiping have been ordered to rush to Chaoyang by air and land. The market in Chaoyang and Fuxin, where the National Army has arrived, has recovered. The Central Bank will go to establish a branch.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chaoyang, 21st dispatch] Hundreds of personnel of the Rehe Provincial Government and its affiliated units arrived here by car again today.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] Reports say that large numbers of National Army troops are heading to the Northeast by land, sea, and air. The main force of the New Sixth Army and the New First Army has arrived in the Northeast. The Fifth Army is scheduled to take the route from Yunnan via Haiphong to the Northeast by waterway at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 21st dispatch] A portion of the airlifted troops continued to arrive here today. Due to weather conditions yesterday, transportation was suspended for one day.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices in Beiping Soar This Week; Break Through the 100,000 Mark; Few Transactions of Large-Denomination Rupees in Kunming</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] Gold prices in Beiping have soared this week. After breaking through the 90,000 mark yesterday, the market continued to rise this afternoon, breaking through the 100,000 mark. The highest price reached 100,700 yuan per tael. The US dollar also rose to 1,480 yuan. Silver dollars also rose. Stimulated by this, commodity prices have also become firm. It is reported that the reason for the rise in gold prices is purely due to the surge in gold prices in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] After the Indian government banned the circulation of large-denomination rupees, there were very few rupee transactions in Kunming. There were almost no takers for large-denomination notes of 1,000 yuan or more. According to an estimate by a tycoon in the business community, the amount of rupees in circulation in Kunming is about 30 million yuan. If this law can be applied abroad, the financial community in Kunming will suffer a great loss.</p>
<h3>US Military Leftover Materials; We Are Cleaning Up and Receiving</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the US military left Kunming one after another. How many materials did they leave behind, and how many materials did we receive? This is a military secret, and outsiders have no way of knowing this mystery. However, various US military items can be openly bought in stores and on stalls in Kunming. In the mansions and private residences of some people, you can see US military supplies obtained without labor. Where do these things come from? It seems to have become an open secret. It is not known how many times the banning order has been reiterated or how many times it has been implemented, but the result is still useless. The eyes of the general public are focused on the reception work in the recovered areas. What went wrong can still be seen in the newspapers, but the actual problems in the rear areas are kept secret. According to a senior general, the materials left by the US military in Yunnan are like a drop in the ocean in the entire European Theater, but they are actually a large number in China. Our military authorities have recently set up an institution in Chongqing to take over the US materials and set up special commissioner offices in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi. Special Commissioner Zhao, a lieutenant general, leads more than 100 experts, and has recently arrived in Kunming from Chongqing to begin clearing and receiving work, which is expected to be completed in about two months. People are placing great hope on this new institution.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] The US military in the Kunming area is tentatively scheduled to withdraw for the last time on the 25th of this month. There are only about 100 people left, mostly officers and soldiers from the Army Aviation Transportation Team, the Aircraft Repair Team, and the US Military Cemetery Registration Team.</p>

<h3>Improving People's Livelihood, Developing the Textile Industry: President Song's Written Explanation of the Significance of Establishing a Company</h3>
<p>[This City's News] President Song, while receiving reporters yesterday, read aloud a written statement regarding the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The government's economic construction policy has already determined that general light industries will be privately operated. Regarding the recent takeover of Japanese yarn factories, I originally advocated for private operation as well. However, after careful consideration by the government, it was decided to organize the China Textile Construction Corporation. Although the term is limited to two years, with a maximum extension of one year, some people outside the government still do not understand this. I am therefore providing a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Japanese yarn factories in our country have a total of 1.75 million spindles, roughly equivalent to the number of spindles in our own domestic yarn factories. At the beginning of this takeover, the original intention was to immediately invite bids for sale and transfer them to private operation. However, because our businessmen are still suffering after eight years of arduous war and their economic strength has not yet recovered, it is feared that there would be few buyers at present. Moreover, the government would have difficulty estimating prices at once. Furthermore, the government must immediately restore production in the factories it takes over, so it is impossible to wait.</p>
<p>Currently, various private yarn factories operated by our own people in various places are experiencing difficulties due to a lack of working capital, and they are requesting loans from national banks. Therefore, even if someone were to purchase the factories, the government would still have to maintain them, which is equivalent to the government allocating funds to take over the operation itself. The national treasury would not receive a substantial income from the sale of the yarn factories.</p>
<p>Secondly, after World War II, all countries are experiencing a severe shortage of yarn and cloth, and prices are soaring. After World War I, our domestic [text missing] began to develop. The public [text missing] enthusiastically subscribed to yarn factory shares, almost to the point of frenzy. However, in the end, industrialists [text missing] control abilities, rushed ahead of one another, and did not understand the principles of supply and demand. As a result, the textile industry soon suffered a major setback. The current situation is similar again. The profits from operating textile [text missing] can double the principal, and the people who operate the textile industry do not have the strength to buy at this time. I ask, what obligation does the government have to sell these yarn factories to a few people with existing wealth and help them get rich? Based on the above points, the government has decided that after two years, when the economic situation has stabilized and the people's strength has recovered, all the equipment in the yarn factories can be re-evaluated at an appropriate price, and each yarn factory will be sold separately through bidding. This will be done on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the original organization of the Japanese yarn factories. There is also another method, which is to issue shares after each unit has been taken over and put into operation and the price can be estimated. The shares will be sold publicly to the public, and once more than 51% has been achieved, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to change the operation to private, with the government only in a supervisory position.</p>
<p>The above explains in more detail the reasons why the government is temporarily placing the yarn factories under state management. However, these are only passive reasons. There are also active reasons that deserve attention, so I will briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>The government must be responsible for improving the people's needs for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the so-called four basic needs, and for raising and supplying the necessities of life. Yarn and cloth are [text missing] necessities of life, and the government must strongly promote the development of the textile industry.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan's annual yarn and cloth market abroad was approximately US$300 million. The raw materials used were largely obtained from our country. Japanese textile groups certainly compete with each other in their own country, but they take unified action abroad. Whether in transportation, finance, or insurance, the government and various enterprise organizations form a unified entity, so the profits and losses are calculated as a whole, which allows them to achieve such success. Our country's textile factories have always acted independently in overseas markets. Although there are many of our compatriots in the Philippines and the South Seas Islands, and economic power is in our hands, our country has no position in the textile market, and it is entirely dominated by Japan. Now that the Japanese textile industry has been destroyed, there are many who are vying for its original market. The government has charged the China Textile Construction Corporation with leading the textile industry in the short term, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other Chinese shipping companies' overseas routes, national bank foreign exchange banks, and our country's insurance companies will jointly assist in order to obtain the Japanese's previous annual yarn and cloth market of US$300 million.</p>
<p>Finally, the textile machinery factories are extremely important. The China Textile Construction Corporation is now jointly taking over the relevant Japanese machinery factories with various textile factories, so that it can manufacture its own textile machinery. The initial plan is to be able to produce 250,000 spindles per year and 6,000 automatic looms within one or two years. In the future, our country's textile machinery needs can be supplied domestically, and the foundation of our country's textile industry can be established.</p>
<p>In summary, the government has put a great deal of effort into organizing the China Textile Construction Corporation, and all of this is factual. It is definitely not something that can be broadly criticized with simple slogans of state-owned or private operation.</p>

<h3>British Troops Remaining in Java and Greece: Soviet Representative's Severe Condemnation; Aimed at Retaliatory Measures Against Iran's Appeal; This Action is Akin to Throwing a Bomb at the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] The Soviet Union's formal condemnation of the situation created by the presence of British troops in Greece and Indonesia has complicated the workings of the United Nations organization today, and whether the "Big Five" in the new council can unite has passed its first test. British and American officials held hasty meetings in the early morning regarding this sudden action by the Soviet Union, but no formal response has been found. From a diplomatic standpoint, the Soviet action can be seen as a form of retaliation against Iran's appeal to the Security Council, which occurred within hours of the resignation of the Tehran government. If a more pro-Soviet government is established in Iran, Iran's proposal may end sooner rather than later. In addition, this action occurred hours before Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky was expected to arrive in London, and his tardiness had aroused all kinds of speculation. Soviet delegation acting head Gromyko submitted a written proposal to the Security Council requesting that the United Nations organization take action on the Greek issue, and Ukrainian chief representative Manuilsky also submitted a written request for the United Nations organization to take action on the Indonesian issue. Gromyko stated that the current presence of British troops in Greece has become a method of exerting pressure on the domestic political situation in that country, and Manuilsky accused British troops and "Japanese enemy troops" in Indonesia of taking action against the local population. The Soviet side believes that the situation in both places threatens the "maintenance of peace and security." A senior British official believed that the Soviet action was a counter-action against Britain's support for Iran, but expressed doubt as to whether the Soviet Union could obtain the necessary majority in the Security Council, namely the support of seven member states. If the Soviet Union fails to achieve this, it will not be able to place the Greek and Indonesian issues on the agenda. The Soviet action has further complicated the urgent issue of the Security Council's election of a Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, as this requires the unanimous agreement of the "Big Five," which has not yet been achieved. The eleven members of the Security Council held a formal discussion on this issue yesterday, but no agreement was reached, and another informal meeting is scheduled. The Security Council has not met since the Iranian issue was raised. It is expected that a formal meeting will be held when the "Big Five" hope to reach a consensus on the election of the Secretary-General.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting; Byrnes Postpones Return to Country</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] According to London broadcasting on the 22nd: The British Cabinet convened an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss the Soviet Union's protest to the Security Council against the presence of British troops in Greece and Indonesia. British Prime Minister Attlee stated that the Soviet move was completely unexpected by the British government. According to the Greek Prime Minister, the presence of British troops in Greece was with the full consent of the Greek government. It is said that the Security Council has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss the Soviet protest.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] The nature of the issue raised by the Soviet Union is slightly different from the Iranian issue. Iran raised an issue concerning itself to the United Nations organization, but the issue raised by the Soviet Union is not directly related to itself. However, according to Article 5 of the Charter, the Soviet Union has the full right to raise the above-mentioned issue to the United Nations organization, because that article stipulates that "any member of the United Nations" may bring "any dispute or situation" to the attention of the Security Council or the General Assembly. The initial reaction of officials of the United Nations organization here is that opposition to British policy in Greece is stronger and more forceful than opposition to British policy in Indonesia, and they point out that the presence of British troops in Indonesia is in accordance with the orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who went there to conduct the handover of the Japanese army. However, even with the orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the British action has been met with extremely severe criticism worldwide. It was impossible to contact Security Council Chairman Makin this morning to hear his views. His office announced that he had gone to the British Foreign Office for a meeting, which is believed to be in consultation with Foreign Minister Bevin. At the same time, the U.S. delegation also met this morning to discuss the various issues facing the United Nations organization. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes was originally scheduled to return to Washington on Thursday, but now it is feared that this will not be possible.</p>
<h3>Five Arab Countries Will Also Make Demands: Security Council Encounters Another Difficulty</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London broadcasting on the 23rd: The Security Council, which is in turmoil, will encounter a fourth difficult issue in a row in three days.

<h3>French and South African Mandated Territories Should Be Transferred to Trusteeship: New Zealand Representative Advocates</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser today requested in the United Nations organization Trusteeship Committee that France and South Africa immediately transfer their mandated territories to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and that the two countries' hesitation to declare the transfer of their mandated territories to the United Nations is incomprehensible. Regardless of its legal status, morally speaking, no country has the right to abuse its trust land. It must be known that the mandated territory does not belong to the mandating country. Previously, French Foreign Minister Bidault had declared on Saturday that France would consider transferring its mandated territory to the United Nations, but only with the consent of representatives from French and French mandated territories Cameroon and Togo, and a trusteeship agreement would be drawn up. The French Guinea representative told the committee today that France wanted to incorporate Cameroon and Togo into its territory, and representatives from both places are now assisting in the formulation of the new French constitution. Fraser therefore immediately demanded that France clarify its intentions. South Africa has also expressed its intention to incorporate the former German territory of Southwest Africa into the Union of South Africa, and Fraser declared that any attempt to annex the mandated territory would render international obligations a scrap of paper. Although legally unclear, morally, these countries should agree to transfer their mandated territories to the current United Nations Trusteeship Committee.</p>

<h3>Italy Requests to Retain its Colonies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister De Gasperi addressed the Art Council yesterday, saying that Italy should be allowed to retain Trieste, South Tyrol, and some of its colonies. He advocated resolving the Adriatic Sea issue based on the Wilsonian principles of 1919, which advocated dividing the Istrian Peninsula into two parts, east and west. The western part, including the ports of Trieste, Pula, and Koper, should belong to Italy, and the eastern part, Fiume, should belong to Yugoslavia. Italy retained the Brenner Pass border for economic and strategic reasons. Italy will be generous to the minorities within its territory. De Gasperi also said that Italy had the right to retain its colonies, especially Eritrea, which should be governed by itself, but should also accept the military control of other countries. De Gasperi opposed the US proposal to confiscate Italian property abroad as compensation.</p>

<h3>New Developments in the Iran-Soviet Affair: Hakimi Cabinet Resigns En Masse, Iranian Parliament Considers New Prime Minister Candidates</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] Following the resignation of Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi, the Iranian Parliament is scheduled to convene a special session today to consider candidates for the new prime minister.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Iranian delegation formally requested the UN Security Council to investigate the Iran-Soviet dispute. In less than 24 hours, Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi and his entire cabinet suddenly resigned, causing a new turn in the Iran-Soviet affair. Our correspondent in Tehran reported yesterday that Prime Minister Hakimi claimed, after submitting his resignation to the Iranian King on Sunday night, that the Iranian issue had been submitted to UN agencies for handling, and he was satisfied and resigned. Since the end of the Azerbaijan rebellion, Hakimi has repeatedly attempted to contact the Soviet government through the Soviet Embassy in Iran, but to no avail. A few weeks ago, he requested permission to fly to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet government, but was also unsuccessful, so his resignation was expected. The following three individuals are considered most likely to succeed as prime minister: Erte Nai, a major landlord in northern Iran; Mansour, the governor of Khorasan Province; and former Prime Minister Binia. The resignation of the Iranian cabinet may prevent the nascent UN organization from being immediately subjected to a major test. If the new Iranian government is willing to hold out-of-court negotiations, it can formally withdraw its appeal to the Security Council. The Security Council held an informal meeting yesterday afternoon to study the most appropriate way to deal with the Iran-Soviet dispute. Given that the Iranian government has already resigned, it seems unnecessary to make a decision too early.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast: The autonomous government of Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran has established a Ministry of Commerce and Finance to establish trade relations with foreign countries and to determine the necessities of the population.</p>

Azerbaijani merchants are now requesting the autonomous government to directly establish economic relations with foreign countries. From a geographical point of view, the government may trade with northern Turkey, but the Turkish government will not be enthusiastic about this.</p>
<h3>Hungary's Lispe Oil Fields Occupied by Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] "The New York Times" today carried a report from the Hungarian capital stating that the Red Army has occupied the Lispe oil fields in Hungary, including the largest oil field of the Socony Vacuum Oil Company. A few days ago, the Soviet side ordered its own geologists to work in the oil fields, excluding the general manager of Socony Vacuum Oil Company from the site, but the crude oil extracted is still refined using the Socony Vacuum Oil Pipeline Company's refinery, and the Soviet Union pays the expenses. This move by the Soviet Union shows that it intends to extract oil from the oil fields to the greatest extent possible, regardless of whether the oil fields will be depleted in the long run, as it expects the Red Army to eventually withdraw from Hungary.</p>
<h3>Film Shown for the First Time in the Japanese Imperial Palace, Projector Damaged, Film Unfinished</h3>

<h3>Over Fifty High-Ranking Bureaucrats in Charge of Japanese Internal Affairs Dismissed, MacArthur to Investigate Financial Conglomerate Regulations Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Before Japan's surrender, senior bureaucrats of the Ministry of Home Affairs and governors of various prefectures had formed a political clique controlling the internal life of the country. More than twenty such governors and thirty-three senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs have resigned due to MacArthur's purge of politics. The Ministry of Home Affairs was almost an all-powerful institution in Japan, controlling the salt and tobacco monopolies of various prefectures, as well as all public buildings. Even the 93,000 police officers were under its control. Local governors did not have to be local residents, but were selected and dispatched from Tokyo. The new Minister of Home Affairs, Mitomi, will follow MacArthur's orders to eliminate the old and introduce the new, and plans to select commoners and vice-ministerial level officials who have no past misconduct to serve as major prefectural governors. All those over the age of sixty will not be selected. It is said that Mitomi is considering several merchants and former members of parliament who previously had no say in the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese Liberal Party today again proposed a draft new constitution, advocating that national sovereignty be entrusted to the king for supervision, and that the king be relieved of all legal and political responsibilities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The Allied Headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to report details of the fourteen Zaibatsu (financial conglomerates) and eighteen major companies in Japan.

The purpose is to establish the relationship between major companies and their subsidiaries. The Japanese government will submit a list of important employees and shareholders holding more than one percent of the company's shares as of January 1 this year. In addition, all questions relate to the relationship between the parent company and its associated or subsidiary companies. The fourteen Zaibatsu investigated by the headquarters are Mitsui, Miyazaki (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries), Sumitomo, Yasuda, Kawasaki, Uesano, Iwasaki (aircraft industry), Shibusawa, Furukawa, Okura, Nomura, Noguchi, Aikawa (Manchurian Heavy Industries), and Okouchi.</p>

<h3>British Church Plans to Establish an Organization for Modernized Evangelism, Utilizing Advertising, Film, and Wireless Broadcasting; Total Cost Under $4 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] The Archbishops and Bishops of the major churches of England are planning to establish a permanent organization for modernized evangelism. A preliminary report on a five-year campaign has been submitted, which will utilize various modern propaganda institutions to engage in evangelism, publish Christian advertisements in newspapers, screen religious short films in cinemas, and broadcast religious news through wireless radio, in order to turn the whole country to Christianity. The total cost of this campaign will be no less than four million US dollars. According to the report, although there is no lack of opposition to the church's use of advertising, given the current state of Christianity, it is imperative to take concrete action. Only by utilizing the best art and skills to glorify God and serve God can the church reach the countless people who crave spiritual power. It is estimated that this campaign will require 200,000 English pounds per year, equivalent to 100,000 US dollars, but it should be developed gradually. Only a fraction of this amount needs to be spent in the first year. As for how to raise this money, it should be approached through prayer and detailed consideration from all aspects. However, the truth that there has never been a lack of necessary financial assistance in promoting spiritual cultivation should also be taken into account. To achieve the best results, it will take years, but repeated advertising will give readers time to reflect. According to a spokesman for the Church Union, today's world is in the age of science, and everything will evolve into scientific terms. However, scientific progress will eventually have its limits, and when it hits a wall, religion will revive as a result. At this time, a truly organized church can enjoy its benefits. If the Archbishops and Bishops agree to establish a permanent evangelistic organization, any form or method can be adopted. The outline includes prayer, propaganda, regional meetings held by church liaison groups, and newspaper advertisements and pamphlets on selected topics. However, this is only one aspect, and there are many other methods. The approach may first focus on religious facts, or establish images of the Lord, or answer questions, or use a higher level of philosophy. All of this remains to be determined.</p>
<h3>French Reform Party Unwilling to Compromise, New Government Stillborn, Communist Party Nominates Gouin as Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 23rd, the French Constituent Assembly decided today after several hours of discussion that the new head of France will be elected at 3 p.m. on the 23rd, replacing General de Gaulle.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The French Progressive Catholic Party has refused to form a government with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to replace the one led by de Gaulle. The Communist Party then asked the Socialist Party to form a two-party government with a Communist Party member as the head of government. The leaders of the three parties engaged in intense political activity all day yesterday. Progressive Catholic Party leader and Foreign Minister Bidault said after meeting with Communist Party leader Thorez, "I am not a prophet, but I believe we will soon have a three-party government." As for who will form the new government, the final decision may not be known until after the French Constituent Assembly meets this afternoon. The majority of leaders of the Progressive Catholic Party are unwilling to serve in a three-party government led by a Communist Party member. Yesterday afternoon, General de Gaulle left his private residence in Neuilly and drove to a hunting lodge in the Forêt de Marly outside Paris. His letter of resignation was published yesterday. It said, "I have decided to retire because France is no longer in a state of emergency. I hope the succeeding government will complete the task of ensuring the destiny of our country."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The Communist Party today resolved to nominate the President of the National Assembly, the Socialist Gouin, to succeed General de Gaulle, who resigned yesterday, as the head of the coalition government formed by the three major parties in France. The Communist Party originally intended to form a government with its leader Thorez, but was opposed by the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, so it issued this resolution. The National Assembly is scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. today, and it is expected that no firm agreement will be reached between the parties before this afternoon. A plan has been drafted to have the National Assembly pay close attention to de Gaulle's formal resignation, and then adjourn to await resumption tomorrow. This morning, the executive committees of the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement held meetings in preparation for convening a joint meeting of the Communist and Socialist Parties this afternoon. In addition to Gouin, the name of Auriol is the most prominent among the candidates for the coalition government. Some political parties, mostly conservatives and right-wing members, advocate the election of former Prime Minister Herriot to succeed de Gaulle. Herriot arrived here this morning by train from Lyon. He said he would attend the Radical Party meeting in order to review the overall situation. The Socialist Party refused to form a purely left-wing government with the Communist Party alone, and insisted on organizing a coalition government of the three major parties. The People's Republican Movement refused to participate in a government led by the Communist Party. To break this deadlock, the only option is to organize a three-party coalition government with a Socialist Party member acceptable to all parties as the leader.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] More than 1,300 French perfume manufacturers are currently striving to restore their export business despite various technical and raw material difficulties. In peacetime, the French perfume industry employed approximately 20,000 workers and earned an average net profit of 400 million francs per year. During the German occupation, perfume exports were severely restricted, but due to soaring prices, the sales volume was still quite large. Currently, all perfumes are subject to a 25% luxury tax, and sales are still widespread domestically, especially in areas where American troops are stationed. It is said that since the liberation of Paris, there have always been many American soldiers queuing in front of the Chanel perfume store to buy the famous Chanel No. 5 perfume. An ordinary bottle costs about 400 francs. Another perfume that is popular among American soldiers is "Christmas Night" from the Caron factory, which currently sells for 2,000 francs per bottle, compared to only 300 francs in 1938. Several new brands of perfume have now appeared on the Paris market, priced quite high, but their names have not yet been heard overseas.</p>
<h3>Truman Consults with All Parties on Methods to Resolve Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Special] After the US steelworkers went on strike, Truman and congressional leaders met at the White House this morning, but no temporary solution has yet been found. Today, they are considering using the wartime emergency powers that have not yet ended to have the government take over the striking factories. According to the above method, the workers in each factory will resume work under government supervision, pending continued arbitration and final resolution.</p>
<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 22nd] After the US steelworkers' strike, approximately 1,300 steel mills, aluminum mills, and ore plants in 29 states have been shut down, and the national railways and public utilities are also beginning to feel the impact today.</p>
<h3>Our Request for Increased Relief Funds from UNRRA May Not Be Granted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The UNRRA's (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) budget for this year has reached $3 billion, but countries ravaged by war are still making requests to the agency, and their voices cannot be ignored. This is especially concerning to Americans, as the additional funds will mostly be requested from the United States. Of the $3 billion budget, Americans have already contributed over 70%, but most of this money has not yet been collected and will require continued appropriation requests in Congress. Although the agency has already received a large amount of money, it still feels that supply cannot meet demand. Currently, the largest amount of UNRRA relief is for China, totaling $67.5 million, which will be used for relief in the next fifteen months, not including reconstruction needs. However, even this amount is not enough to meet the urgent relief needs in China, so it has requested the agency to increase it to $97.5 million. According to officials of the China branch, according to this example, the amount of funds received by China is far less than other afflicted countries, which is contrary to the principle of fairness. Take Italy as an example, its population is only one-tenth of China's, yet it receives $40.9 million. UNRRA officials do not deny that China's needs are enormous and that its request for an increase has a very strong moral force. Unfortunately, the budgets of all countries have been drafted by international experts, and the difficulty lies in the fact that funds are insufficient for distribution. From the current situation, it seems difficult for China to obtain another grant from UNRRA. Agency officials are even concerned that China may not be able to fully absorb the 3 million tons of relief supplies, because its domestic distribution system is unsound and it seems unable to absorb the full amount.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand US War Brides to Be Transported from England to the US by the End of February</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 21st] The US military authorities announced today that by the end of February, approximately 10,000 US military war brides and their children will be transported from England to the United States. There are sufficient ships available for this purpose. The first batch is scheduled to depart from Southampton on the Argentina on January 28, carrying approximately 625 people. The Queen Mary is scheduled to set sail on February 2, carrying 2,400 people. In addition, there are seven more ships that will take US military brides to the US in February. Currently, there are no less than 50,000 brides and their children waiting for transportation, including those from France, whose departure dates have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>American Merchant Returns from China, Discusses the Future of Sino-US Trade, Prospects for Commercial Revival in China, Current Need for Cotton Textiles is Especially High</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Salt Lake City, 21st] American merchant Mr. Colbert, who recently returned to the United States after inspecting commercial conditions in Shanghai, recently told Mr. Young, a well-known writer on Far Eastern affairs, that the future of Sino-US trade is very bright, and he predicted that the commercial revival of China will make Shanghai the most attractive and important commercial center since it was opened as a port. Less than three months after the end of the war, Mr. Colbert's first shipment to Shanghai was 25,000 dozen handkerchiefs. He said that after the inflation on December 2 last year, prices rose to their peak. Now that rice, wheat, and cotton have been transported to various ports in central China, the price of goods, which was originally three to ten times higher than prices around the world, has fallen by two-thirds. Goods hidden in warehouses for up to four years, fearing being seized by the Japanese, are now being sold off by their owners. This is because they believe that once American ships arrive and the source of imports increases, prices will inevitably fall further. According to export merchants, the price of food produced in China this year can be stabilized, and the price of imported goods can return to the standard price level around the world by the end of this year or earlier. Cotton mills have been closed due to a lack of fuel and proper equipment. Once a large amount of American cotton is transported to China in accordance with the UNRRA program, they can resume operations. Various cotton fabrics and blue denim will play an important role in Chinese commercial activities. Mr. Colbert does not share the pessimism of some foreign merchants, who fear that the abolition of extraterritoriality in China will reduce the special rights enjoyed by foreign merchants in China for nearly a century. As for trade in Hong Kong, he said that recovery is expected if the port can be detached from the sterling bloc. He believes that the British will restore their position in the insurance and shipping industries. Mr. Colbert predicts that commercial recovery in North China will be slower, as the political situation there is still unstable, so it will take time for Tianjin to regain its position as a commercial center.</p>
<h3>Military Action in the Haifa-Yafa Area</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 23rd, large-scale military operations have taken place in the 35-mile coastal strip between Haifa and Jaffa. All traffic has been diverted inland, and British artillery and armored vehicles have been placed in key areas. Wooden cages have also been placed on the roadside for the purpose of arresting suspects.</p>
<h3>Pre-War New Ireland Was Snail-Free, Now They Are Everywhere in the Fields</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 21st] The gardens of New Ireland, Australia, were snail-free before the war. Now they are everywhere, numbering in the millions, damaging flowers and vegetables and causing great harm. However, these snails have become a treasure for the local Japanese, who eat them as a supreme delicacy, either stir-fried or braised. The Japanese claim that these snails were dropped by American pilots to destroy vegetable gardens, but Australian reporters say that they were either brought in by the Japanese themselves by boat.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Suzhou Award for Informing on Secret Sales of Military Supplies: The Suzhou Receiving Group of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Region of the Military Department has specifically announced an award for informing on secret sales. Regulations for dealing with the secret sale of military medical supplies stipulate that anyone who knows of people hiding, secretly selling, or purchasing enemy or puppet military medical equipment can report it to the group, regardless of the status of the perpetrators. Once the people and the goods are seized, a reward of 40% of the value of the confiscated materials will be given and forwarded. The name of the informant will be kept absolutely confidential.</p>
<p>Changshu: Association Requests Allocation of Flour: The Changshu Post-War Relief Association, given the arrival of winter and the urgent need for relief for the poor, and in addition to providing porridge and lending winter clothing through the Winter Relief Association, has investigated the number of poor people in the county and submitted a request to the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the Post-War Relief Administration for an allocation of flour for relief. Furthermore, the county's warehouses have been located at the Da Shun Factory and Hu Tai Factory outside Xiaodongmen, with very convenient land and water transportation.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Japanese Prisoners of War Concentrated for Management and Training Before Being Sent Back to the Beijing-Shanghai Region: Ma Yiming, Director of the Wuxi Japanese Prisoner of War Management Office, stated that for the convenience of managing and training the more than 15,900 Japanese prisoners of war under his jurisdiction in Wuxi and Changzhou, 20 concentration camps have been established in Wuxi and 8 in Changzhou. He also received orders to transport all Korean soldiers and Japanese military police officers and soldiers among the Japanese prisoners of war to Shanghai for separate concentration, awaiting ships to send them back. Director Ma, knowing that the Japanese prisoners of war would be leaving Wuxi for Shanghai, specifically convened the Japanese military police yesterday morning for a lecture, proclaiming the true meaning of democracy and the virtues of our country's supreme commander, which deeply moved the Japanese prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Chief of the Fifth Precinct Prosecuted for Neglect of Duty: Zhou Qiruo, former Chief of the Fifth Precinct of this county, along with Zhao Qi, Inspector, and Deng Junchen, Police Chief, were investigated and prosecuted by the court's prosecutor's office for neglect of duty and bribery. Several interrogations were conducted, and Hua Peigen and You Zixin, two tea servants involved, were arrested. Chen Zhongwu and thirteen other police chiefs and officers of the precinct were also summoned for strict interrogation. Zhou Qiruo admitted to accepting bribes of 200 million puppet currency. Chief Judge Ma concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution with the criminal court according to the seventh clause of Zhou's regulations.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Supervising Envoy Inquires About the People's Livelihood in His Hometown: Cheng Zhonghang, Supervising Envoy of the Jiangsu District of the Control Yuan, arrived in Changzhou from Wuxi on the 20th with Gu Ruo and three other police officers. This was Cheng's first visit to Changzhou as part of his inspection of the control area. In addition to the heads of various agencies, dozens of relatives and friends welcomed him at the station. After entering the city, Cheng went to his former residence in Huajiaoyuan and met with reporters at 4:00 PM, inquiring about the general state of the news media since the restoration, the local military discipline, whether the reorganized police force still had the style of the occupied period, the issue of traitors, and whether there were any cases of malicious accusations. Cheng stated that this time, his visit to Changzhou revealed that many local people were pessimistic, and that the suffering after the victory had not yet been alleviated. He hoped that the military, police, and judicial departments would work together to redress grievances and alleviate the burdens of the people. He also mentioned that in Suzhou, the director of tax donations, Da Fa, had been handed over to the county jail and transferred to the court. In Wuxi, the people were actively reporting corruption. He felt that the supervisory system, if carried out with the spirit of the war of resistance, would definitely be effective. Someone suggested that a secret supervisory network be established to exercise authority through "lightning strikes," a suggestion that Cheng found quite agreeable. He scheduled a symposium for all sectors of society at the County Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 21st to inquire about the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Qingpu: County Dispatches Troops to Confiscate Weapons from Security Corps: After the victory in this county, the first County Chief Wang, recognizing the many roaming soldiers and bandits in the suburbs who were committing robberies, established the Qingpu Security Corps. Since its establishment, due to the complex composition of the corps and the lack of training, it not only did not help but also led to repeated robbery cases in the countryside, which came to the attention of the superiors. Therefore, on the 15th, he dispatched the Second Battalion of Infantry, led by XX, to Qingpu, using swift and decisive means to disarm the entire corps. On the morning of the 18th, all the soldiers were escorted to the division headquarters in Kunshan.</p>
<p>Qingdao: Central Bank Exchanges Puppet United Reserve Bank Notes: The Qingdao Central Bank began exchanging puppet United Reserve Bank notes on the 15th of this month. However, because few people in the city were aware of it, there was not a large crowd seeking to exchange. Furthermore, since various banks in Qingdao had already been handling the deposit of puppet currency converted into legal tender, many merchants deposited the puppet currency at various banks. In addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Trust Bureau, Exchange Bureau, Shanghai Bank, Continental Bank, Guohua Bank, Industrial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Donglai Bank and other banks and bureaus were entrusted to handle the exchange separately. The denominations exchanged were all 100 yuan or more. If counterfeit banknotes were found, the exchange agency would immediately stamp them as void and not exchange them. If the holder of the notes was suspected of mixing counterfeits, they would be handed over to the judicial authorities for investigation. The exchange period was limited to four months from the start date, and all notes would be invalidated after the deadline. A total of twelve exchange agencies handled the exchange, and the total amount exchanged on the 15th alone was over 310 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Voices of Liberation in African Mandated Territories: The Scenery of Cameroon Enters the Painting, "Dark Continent" Has Become a Historical Term</h3>
<p>— Special Article from the Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Dr. Wellington Koo, Chief Representative of China to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th of this month, hoping to establish a Trusteeship Council. He said: The trusteeship system is a progressive improvement compared to the mandate system. The trusteeship system can accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that the wish to establish self-governing governments and achieve independence can be realized at an early date, and tens of millions of people under mandate will benefit.</p>
<p>The day after Ambassador Koo delivered the above speech (the 17th), British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced at the United Nations General Assembly that Britain had decided to transfer the African mandated territories of Tanganyika, Cameroon, and Togoland to the United Nations organization for trusteeship, and to make Transjordan an independent state. The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. This move by Britain can be regarded as the most wise and frank measure taken by a member state of the United Nations to date. In other words, Britain has taken the lead in implementing the obligations imposed on member states by the United Nations Charter to administer non-self-governing territories. We believe that this is a ray of light for the governed peoples to enter a bright world from the dark ages.</p>
<p>The Situation of Mandated Territories Voluntarily Abandoned by Britain</p>
<p>After the First World War, most of Germany's colonies in Africa were mandated to Britain, totaling four: (1) South West Africa, mandated to the Union of South Africa, (2) Tanganyika, (3) Cameroon, (4) Togoland. The mandated territories that Britain is preparing to abandon and transfer to the United Nations organization for trusteeship are the three places other than South West Africa.</p>
<h3>Tanganyika</h3>
<p>Located south of Kenya in Central Africa, with an area of more than 940,000 square kilometers, it is the majority of the former German East Africa. After the First World War, it was divided between Britain and Belgium, and in 1921 it was mandated to Britain by the former League of Nations. From then on, the East Africa and South Africa territories held by Britain were linked together. This area is located on the east side of the Great Rift Valley, with many large lakes and volcanoes. The land has been gradually developed, and agriculture and animal husbandry are thriving, especially the rich forests. Before the European War, the Germans meticulously managed this area, building a transcontinental railway from Dar es Salaam to Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, and had ambitious plans to extend it to Cameroon and South West Africa to traverse the entire African continent, in order to compete with the British transcontinental railway.</p>
<p>The majority of the inhabitants of Tanganyika are Bantu natives, with a total population of over five million and 16,000 Europeans. It is governed by a governor, with two councils, executive and legislative, below. Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanganyika, with a railway to the shores of Lake Tanganyika, which is the starting point of the transcontinental railway. Mombasa to the north is a good coastal harbor, with bustling merchants, and a railway to the shores of Lake Victoria, making it the gateway to East Africa. The northwest corner of the area is administered by Belgium and merged into the Belgian Congo. The products include tropical products such as coconut oil, rubber, cotton, coffee, and sugar, tobacco, etc., but the climate is unfavorable and development is not easy. Ujiji is on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. In 1871, explorers Livingstone and Stanley met here, and since then it has become famous throughout the world.</p>
<h3>Cameroon</h3>
<p>Located between Nigeria and French Equatorial Africa in Central Africa, with an area of more than 350,000 square kilometers, it is an important area of the former German West Africa. In 1916, it was seized from Germany, and three years later it was divided between Britain and France. The majority was mandated to France, and the area bordering Nigeria was mandated to Britain, with an area of 80,200 square kilometers. In 1922, it was handed over to British mandate, with a population of less than one million, and was concurrently administered by the Governor of Nigeria. Cameroon has fertile land and lush forests, producing rubber, palm, ivory, etc. Coconut and coffee cultivation is particularly thriving. In the basin of the Cameroon River, there are endless mineral resources, but due to the harsh climate, it has never been successfully developed.</p>
<p>In the interior of Cameroon, there are many Catholic priests, mostly from Northern Europe. They often travel in and out of black villages under the attack of heat and epidemics, engaging in missionary work.</p>
<h3>Togoland</h3>
<p>Located between the Gold Coast colony and French Dahomey, with an area of more than 32,000 square kilometers, it was originally occupied by Germany. In August 1945, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. After the First World War, it was divided between Britain and France, with Britain administering the west and France administering the east. France owns the coastline and also has a larger area. The area under British mandate has a population of less than 500,000 and is concurrently administered by the Governor of the Gold Coast. The port of Lome in Togoland faces the Slave Coast, and cultural progress is slow. This area produces diamonds, but they are generally prohibited from being exported overseas. Local natives often take diamonds wrapped in cloth and peddle them to passersby on the street. Originally, the diamond mines in the area were designated, and the stones produced by the designated mines were prohibited from being bought and sold, so diamonds from outside the designated mines freely roamed the streets. In order to seek profit, many Jewish diamond merchants went to Daoli to buy cheap and good quality diamonds from the local natives.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Africa</h3>
<p>Large deserts, large forests, sweltering heat, plagues, jungles, and wild beasts are the characteristics of Africa, hence it is known as the "Dark Continent." Apart from the only republic of Liberia, the rest of the area has been divided by the world's powers. However, in recent years, the culture of advanced countries has gradually been instilled, and at the same time, there are more and more railways, transportation has become more convenient, and the knowledge level of the natives has gradually increased. The so-called "Dark Continent" has become a historical term. This time, Britain first demonstrated its wise virtue by abandoning the mandate and transferring it to the United Nations organization for trusteeship, which has a significant impact, at least in the sense of liberating the African people. It is believed that other countries administering non-self-governing areas will follow Britain and resolutely abandon their mandated territories and place them under the United Nations Trusteeship System.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Gunpowder and Sulfur Authorities: Zheng Zuya Discusses Control Policy Issues</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>Gunpowder and sulfur are the main raw materials for national defense industries, and their uses, such as armaments, mining, and road construction, cannot be done without gunpowder and sulfur. As for its types, such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid, they are even necessary for general chemical industries. The government's policy on the management of gunpowder and sulfur is also of concern to the community. I recently heard that the General Administration of Gunpowder and Sulfur of the Ministry of Finance has moved its office from the capital city to Shanghai. Therefore, the reporter visited Zheng Zuya, Director of the Gunpowder and Sulfur Administration, at 1361 Xinzha Road. The following is a summary of the conversation:</p>
<p>Who Governs Gunpowder and Sulfur?</p>
<p>Q: Gunpowder and sulfur are raw materials for armaments. Why are they under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance?</p>
<p>A: Before 1932, gunpowder and sulfur were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs. At that time, because the areas producing native gunpowder in our country were quite extensive, the nitrate salt produced as a byproduct of gunpowder production was often purchased and consumed privately by producers and the people, which was not only unhygienic but also greatly hindered the income of salt taxes. The former Minister of Finance, Song, in order to increase the revenue of the national treasury, requested that the gunpowder and sulfur industry be placed under the administration of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Importance Issues</p>
<p>Q: Regarding gunpowder and sulfur in the military industry, some people in the community have said that the manufacture of modern national armaments has evolved from black gunpowder to smokeless gunpowder and other organic explosives. The past direct use of gunpowder and sulfur to formulate gunpowder has become a relic in the history of explosives. Has gunpowder really lost its importance in the military industry? What is the actual situation?</p>
<p>A: Black gunpowder and organic explosives, as substances, both have their appropriate uses in the military industry. It cannot be said that because explosives with high explosiveness have been invented, explosives with low explosiveness should be completely abandoned. Moreover, the manufacture of organic explosives mostly uses nitric acid and sulfuric acid as the main raw materials. Our country's manufacturing of nitric acid still lacks fixed gas equipment and must be sourced from saltpeter (i.e., nitrate). And the manufacture of sulfuric acid cannot be done without sulfur. The original materials of organic explosives still cannot be separated from gunpowder and sulfur, but they go through a series of transformation procedures. Other uses, such as the assembly of bombs and shells using T.N.T. explosives, also require the use of gunpowder and sulfur. It is estimated that from 1937 to 1944, the supply of gunpowder and sulfur for military manufacturing, the construction of airfields, the construction of fortresses, and the construction of highways in the Northwest, Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Hunan, and Yuexi, and the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, Shi-Tian, and Zhuan-Jiang railway projects, as well as the mining of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Wuxi, the dredging of the Yangtze River, the Wujiang River, and other rivers, the repair of engineering projects, and the general supply for ordinary civil use, totaled approximately 400,000 dan of gunpowder and approximately 270,000 dan of sulfur. The required quantities are not small, indicating that gunpowder still maintains its importance.</p>
<p>Wartime Policies</p>
<p>Q: What are the important policies for controlling gunpowder and sulfur?</p>
<p>A: The government's policy on gunpowder and sulfur, in terms of business, is naturally based on the principle of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, in order to avoid losses! However, the important purpose is not to increase tax revenue, but to strictly control it, so that national defense industries and private enterprises can be properly coordinated. Therefore, the evolution of the control policy is in response to the situation, in line with the times, in order to make progress. Analyzing its evolution process can be summarized into two stages: wartime and peacetime:</p>
<p>(1) Wartime Policy: Since the outbreak of the war, the original sulfur-rich areas of our country, such as Hebei, Shandong, and the eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu areas, have been occupied by the enemy. Foreign gunpowder and sulfur products cannot be imported due to the blockade of the seaports. At the same time, the needs of military industries have increased sharply compared to before the war, and because military use is urgent, the amount used cannot be estimated in advance. For a time, the supply of gunpowder and sulfur products could not meet the demand, which was very difficult. Therefore, effective measures were adopted to develop reserves and actively increase production in the southwestern provinces, implement official procurement, and control materials. For gunpowder and sulfur factories, a method of lending gunpowder and sulfur raw materials was adopted to enable manufacturers to free up cash and develop their business as soon as possible. Sales were also made on behalf of businesses at public expense to prevent capital accumulation, which was aimed at supporting factories. On the one hand, the product was able to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and provide relief to users who used gunpowder and sulfur as raw materials, in order to develop the national defense industry. Therefore, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the gunpowder and sulfur industry was able to increase gunpowder and sulfur production and supply military needs, and there was never a shortage. During the wartime policy, the following five key tasks were adopted: (1) development and production, (2) centralized materials, (3) supply to the military industry, (4) stable prices, and (5) adjusting surpluses and deficits, which achieved this effect.</p>
<p>Peacetime Policies</p>
<p>(2) Peacetime Policy: Our country's gunpowder and sulfur resources, in terms of nitrate production, do not have nitrate mines like those in Chile. Most of them are extracted from the ground or from the walls of cliffs and caves, using nitrate-bearing soil as raw material. The nitrate content of every 100 catties of soil is only 1% to 3%. The resources existing in the natural world are not abundant. In terms of sulfur production, there are no natural mines like those in the United States and Italy. Most of them are extracted from sulfur-containing pyrite, lead ore, zinc ore, and antimony ore, and most of them are byproducts of various mines, which is far from the output of natural mines. In terms of gunpowder and sulfur types, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, gas acid, and potassium compassion, the factories are just emerging and the scale is not large. In terms of technology, it is also relatively backward, so the finished products are of poor quality and high price. Compared with the industrialized countries of Europe and the United States, they are even more dwarfed. During this period, foreign goods with good quality and low prices were transported and sold to our country's market. Domestic products were bound to be completely bankrupt, which would not only greatly affect our country's established industries, but also make entrepreneurs hesitate to start factories in the future, hindering the development of the country. In order to address the shortcomings of the times, the government should give priority to the use of domestic products and do its best to maintain the original production. On the one hand, it encourages the improvement of emerging technologies and subsidizes efforts to create modern chemical plants, so as to catch up with imported goods that are good quality and low price. It is permissible to reverse the entire downward trend and be self-sufficient. For example, the cost of the raw material for domestic matches, potassium chlorate, is currently more than 100,000 yuan per city dan, while the selling price of foreign goods, including shipping costs, is only about 50,000 yuan. If the government does not find a way to provide relief and maintain them, not only will all the original factories close down, but no one will dare to try this kind of construction project. The market will be permanently occupied by imported goods.</p>
<p>Political Consultative Conference Snippets: What I Saw at the Seventh Conference: Special Chongqing Airmail Report from This Newspaper: Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, the National Government Auditorium was used for the presentation of credentials by the French Ambassador, and the Consultative Conference was rescheduled to 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Zhang Junmai is Radiant</p>
<p>Zhang Junmai arrived in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 16th to attend the Seventh Conference. He was wearing a yellow woolen suit, a red tie, and rimless glasses, and his face was radiant. He shook hands and exchanged greetings with the members in the lounge. When speaking, he first reported that because he waited for four days for a plane in Paris and two days in Cairo, he was six days late, and he apologized to everyone.</p>
<p>Deng Yingchao's Speaking Style</p>
<p>Deng Yingchao's speech was the first time that the voice of a female member was heard in the entire hall. The vocabulary and grammar in her speech were entirely in the style of "Mao Zedong's Proclamations."</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun and Ta Kung Pao</p>
<p>In order to prove the opinions of the non-party on the National Congress, Zhang Bojun read the editorial of Ta Kung Pao in the hall. Chuan Sinian and Wang Yunwu, who were on the non-party seat, sent notes to Hu Lin, saying, "What a loyal reader!" Hu Lin stood up and said in his speech: "Reading Ta Kung Pao, you cannot think that we oppose any issue with one or two editorials."</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi Talks About Shanghai Representatives</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi said: "There are eight representatives from Shanghai to the National Congress, four of whom are not Kuomintang members." Mr. Shao Lizi said: "This is the best explanation."</p>
<p>Zhang Dongsun Causes a Storm</p>
<p>Zhang Dongsun was careless in his words and involved newspaper reporters, causing a major storm. All the reporters protested jointly, and he publicly apologized at the conference. (18th)</p>
<p>Scope of Control</p>
<p>Q: What are the types of gunpowder and sulfur control?</p>
<p>A: The types of gunpowder and sulfur control that have been approved by the National Government include potassium nitrate (i.e., potassium nitrate, saltpeter, or saltpeter), sodium nitrate (i.e., Chilean nitrate or sodium nitrate), calcium nitrate (i.e., calcium nitrate), ammonium nitrate, strontium nitrate, silver nitrate, sulfur (i.e., sulfur, also known as sulfur), potassium chloride (i.e., potassium chloride or potassium chloride), potassium chlorate and potassium chlorate, perchloric acid salt, nitric acid (i.e., nitric acid), sulfuric acid (i.e., sulfuric acid), red phosphorus (i.e., red phosphorus), white phosphorus (i.e., yellow phosphorus), acetylene compounds, trichloroethyl chloride, explosive acid salts, picric acid salts, etc., more than twenty types.</p>
<p>However, the scope of gunpowder and sulfur control should be based on the principle of including all explosive materials. Today, science is changing rapidly. New items are constantly being invented, and the scope of gunpowder and ore control should also be expanded at any time.</p>
<p>Q: What are the management methods for gunpowder and sulfur?</p>
<p>Management Methods</p>
<p>A: The management of gunpowder and sulfur can be divided into two methods.</p>
<p>(1) The management of gunpowder and sulfur is based on the principle of civil manufacturing, official procurement, and official sales. In the production area, the land for centralized production should be selected, the people should be supervised to manufacture, and the public should uniformly give prices for official procurement, so as to transport and sell to the sales area. In the sales area, in addition to official sales, it can also be divided into areas and contracted out to contractors, but all materials are still uniformly handled by the public, with the aim of supporting domestic products.</p>
<p>(2) The management of gunpowder and sulfur products is based on the principle of commercial manufacturing and official sales. The sales method is that after the gunpowder and sulfur products have been inspected by the public, the public can distribute them on behalf of the business and sell them freely, with the aim of facilitating business and benefiting the people.</p>
<h3>Snapshots of Robinson, the American Representative of the Mediation Executive Headquarters</h3>

During World War I, Mr. Robinson graduated from the American Air Service flying school in Alabama.</p>
<p>In 1922, at the young age of twenty-eight, Mr. Robinson was already the Vice President of Virginia's largest bank, the "National Bank of Commerce," and the "Richmond Trust Company." Mr. Robinson was a leader in numerous commercial, civic, and charitable organizations in Virginia.</p>
<p>In December 1942, Mr. Robinson was hired by Stettinius [then administrator of the Lend-Lease program] to work on wartime emergency projects for the U.S. government.</p>
<p>In January 1945, Mr. Robinson accepted an appointment from the U.S. Department of State. He remained in Washington D.C. for several months, carefully studying Chinese affairs. In April of the same year, he accompanied the Secretary of State to the San Francisco Conference, allowing for further discussions before heading to Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Marshal Smiles... Scenes from the Chongqing慰勞 Meeting...</h3>
<p>Marshal Marshall, the special envoy, attended a ball in Chongqing held by various circles to慰勞 Allied soldiers on the evening the ceasefire order was issued, where he was surrounded by Chinese and foreign university students who asked for his autograph.</p>
<p>Until the ink in his pen ran out, falling-petal-like business cards and banknotes continued to be sent to him.</p>
<p>A foreign girl in a black velvet evening gown took out a cloud-white silk handkerchief and asked him to sign it. Marshal smiled.</p>
<p>He said, "What a beautiful handkerchief! I can't bear to write on it!" The young lady begged him like she was pleading with her grandfather, and the old marshal finally wrote his name on it with a smile.</p>
<p>An American boy, seeing that the ink in Marshal's pen had run out, gave him his own pen to use. In the end, he forgot to take it back. As a result, Marshal raised the pen and asked loudly, "Whose pen is this?" [Zhao Haosheng, sent from Chongqing on the 18th]</p>
<h3>Reader's Opinion</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing to you, a loyal admirer of your esteemed newspaper, known as the highest mouthpiece in the Southeast, for its frankness and impartiality. The plight of civil servants during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War is truly lamentable, and I trust your newspaper will express its sympathy. Now that the war has been won, I wish to use your prestigious platform to call for assistance. Enclosed is a manuscript, which I respectfully request to be published for public viewing. By Chen Zeguang, Kunming, 35th year, 元 (first month), 10th day.</p>
<p>A guest asked me: You are fond of the ancients. I wish to cite ancient sayings and use them to illustrate present-day events. Can you do this? I replied: Please, go ahead.</p>
<p>The guest said: I have heard it said that one who rides in another's carriage bears another's troubles, one who wears another's clothes shares another's worries, and one who eats another's food dies for another's cause. Are there such people today? Please explain this. I replied: This is easy to prove; I have seen it, the civil servants are such people.</p>
<p>The guest angrily said: Why do you consider civil servants to be so noble? I do not know about the civil servants of ancient times, but I have seen those of today. There are those who are useless, those who are ignorant, and the sounds of singing and revelry are often heard from them, and their traces are often seen in brothels. Some even abuse their power to oppress the people and enrich themselves, and their waste of public funds and use of private cliques are seen and heard everywhere. Have you not seen this? Why do you consider civil servants to be so noble!</p>
<p>I said: These are just bad elements! How can they be considered among the ranks of civil servants? Just as birds have owls and beasts have cruel beasts, so too do humans have good and bad. I would not stop talking about birds because of the owl, thus abandoning the excellence of the phoenix, nor would I stop talking about beasts because of the cruel beast, thus discarding the virtue of the unicorn. Therefore, when talking about humans, how can we forget the merits of civil servants because of the bad elements? The virtuous and the unworthy are unrelated. The strength of the nation is used to gather the elite of the people, and after more than ten years of cultivation and training, and dozens of trials and selections, they are given positions when they are learned enough and have the talent. In terms of quality, they are also valuable! Since our country entered the path of politics, civil servants have generally been able to fulfill their duties and be loyal to the country. Whether it is politics, education, the military, finance, agriculture, or industry, none of them have not contributed to the effort of civil servants to move toward the norm, and to have today. Although there are differences in the size of positions and the height of talent and virtue, their dedication and effort are the same. The state has gained so much, and the reward is only salary. In terms of merit, they are also admirable! After the Anti-Japanese War, China, weak as it was, resisted the strong leadership of Japan for eight years and finally succeeded. When the triumph of the war was not yet a reality, who dared to say that it would be successful? Only civil servants were able to maintain their original intentions and persevere in their vows, falling and rising again, dying and being resurrected, have you seen this? The government moved its capital, following and supporting it from beginning to end, who were not civil servants? They racked their brains to propose and implement political reforms, were they not civil servants? They endured hardship and propagated the national culture, educating students, without warm clothes and not full bellies, were they not civil servants? They expanded transportation, planned finances, worked hard in transportation and production, were they not civil servants? They supervised the army and went to the front, sweating and bleeding, abandoning their heads and fighting for every inch of land, were they not civil servants? I have also seen civil servants participating in the construction of airfields. When they were rushing to complete the work, they often could not sleep for nights, their faces were haggard and their eyes were red, yet they rushed around the airfield, trying to win a moment to complete it in order to respond to military needs. When the sirens sounded and enemy planes suddenly arrived, guns and bullets crossed, and death was everywhere, they were in as much danger as if they were on the battlefield, and were spared death by a hair's breadth many times. Have you heard of this? Civil servants are able to be so loyal to the country, can it not be said that they are loyal?</p>
<p>The guest said: What you say is indeed true, but I still have doubts in my heart that have not been resolved. Since civil servants are so loyal to the country, then what the country should give civil servants, in my opinion, should be that those who should ride in carriages should be given carriages, those who should wear clothes should be given clothes, and those who should eat food should be given enough to eat. But what I have heard is that those who should ride in carriages are walking; those who should wear clothes are in rags; those who should eat enough are hungry; those who have parents are panting and waiting to die; those who have children are abandoning their studies and standing like cranes; clothes cannot cover and hide their bodies, and their complexions are those of starvation; as the years warm, their children cry of cold, and as the year is plentiful, their wives cry of hunger; the hair is mottled and turns white, and the teeth shake and fall out. Is it not a loss to the country that their families are short-changed? Or is it that their heads hang low and they work hard, dedicating themselves to the country, and are rewarded in this way, and you are indifferent to it? Now that the country has achieved victory and become one of the four powers, like the flourishing of grass and trees, full of vigor and vitality, and at a time of renewal, even for those who invest and profit, there is concern about their bankruptcy and a plan for relief, but civil servants are neglected! Victory bonuses, civil servants do not participate in. The right to be elected, civil servants do not participate in. At a certain time, grain is given, at a certain time, salt is distributed, at a certain time, uniforms are issued, at a certain time, supplies are given, but only mentioned in announcements, and rarely seen in reality, is it possible to quench thirst by looking at plums, and is it possible to fill hunger with a painted cake? Those whom you call glorious civil servants have recently been ordered to have their salaries reduced and their staff reduced. Is it that civil servants who are loyal to the country have not done their best? Or should those who do their best be demeaned? Is it that the state's bright vision cannot reach? In a country with justice, poverty and lowliness are shameful. Beset by poverty and lowliness, they only want to die. The goal of civil servants' efforts is to seek shame and death, which is why I do not understand! Can you teach me?</p>
<p>I said, yes. A gentleman is concerned with the way, not with poverty. In the past, Zigong met Yuan Xian, who regarded poverty as a disease, and Yuan Xian reproached him. What you see today is like Zigong. Those who chase after gambling and are greedy and unworthy are the illness of civil servants; those who are beset by hunger and cold and whose clothes are tattered are the poverty of civil servants. The sick are difficult to cure, but the poor are easy to change. Civil servants can establish themselves and act righteously, and save the country from crisis, thereby turning defeat into victory, this is the responsibility of civil servants. Poor treatment and inadequate compensation are the responsibility of the state. The state has policies, just as the family has rules. Trustworthy rewards and definite punishments are the power of the state, and the urgency of implementation depends on the strength of the state, and then follows. Now that our country is just rising, there are many urgent matters, and the payment of compensation is not the most urgent. Civil servants should only know to fulfill their duty of utmost loyalty, and need not quibble about the one way of compensation. Although civil servants are the pillars of the state and share its fate, the state cannot allow civil servants to be impoverished and die, just as civil servants cannot allow the state to fall and perish. Now that our country has overcome a strong enemy and is striving for renewal, as if emerging from a secluded valley and moving to a tree, escaping from a dangerous road and walking on a smooth road, I believe that the central government will soon improve the treatment of civil servants to stabilize them, and will never allow them to fall and perish, losing their vitality. And in the future, the circumstances of civil servants will rise day by day with the national strength, their lives will be enriched with the national economy, and their fame will rise with the national fortune, and it will not only be a matter of relief, it can be called glory, and it is not a false statement. As for the reduction of staff and the reduction of administration, it is also a matter of national policy. Reducing it here and supplementing it there, transferring duties, what harm is there? Therefore, what I am concerned about is whether civil servants are competent, whether they are honest, not about the thickness of their compensation. Confucius said: "Do not worry about not having a position, worry about how to stand; do not worry about not being known, seek to be worthy of being known."</p>
<p>The guest rejoiced and laughed and said: Hearing your words, the cowardly are courageous, the weak stand up, there are no rebellious children in the family, and there are no rebellious people in the country, and my doubts are dispelled. I will no longer criticize the many with the few, the long with the short, or the virtuous with the unworthy, and I will watch with a new eye to see your words come true. I should congratulate myself, then congratulate the civil servants, and even more congratulate the country! (Chen Zeguang)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Economic Freedom for All of Humanity</h3>
<p>The war aims of the Allied or United Nations side in this Second World War were roughly as follows: (1) As far as China is concerned, at least the restoration of territorial and administrative integrity as it existed before 1895; (2) As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the restoration of the independence and freedom of the small countries of Europe (this is the language of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill), and the attainment of the safety of human society (post-war social security should be a new goal in life, to replace pre-war private profit or profitism, if unemployment still occurs after the war, leaving workers without economic security, dictatorship is bound to arise again - this is the gist of the speech given by the current British Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Rotary Club of London in November 1940); (3) As far as the United States is concerned, the attainment of the Four Freedoms for Humanity of the late President Roosevelt, and the Seven Freedoms for Humanity of the former Vice President Wallace.</p>
<p>The Four Freedoms for Humanity of the late President Roosevelt of the United States are: first, freedom of speech; second, freedom of worship; third, freedom from want, that is, freedom from poverty, unemployment, and economic dislocation; and fourth, freedom from fear, that is, freedom from external aggression. The Seven Freedoms for Humanity of former Vice President Wallace are: first, freedom from fear of unemployment; second, freedom from fear of old age and destitution; third, freedom from fear of disease and hunger; fourth, freedom from class struggle among industrialists, businessmen, farmers, and workers; fifth, freedom from fear of overproduction of necessities leading to bankruptcy and panic; sixth, freedom from racial and religious strife; and seventh, freedom from excessive government interference with the personal thoughts and inventions of the people. Wallace believed that what humanity urgently needs in the world today are these seven freedoms. With these seven freedoms, humanity can enjoy peace and happiness forever. Otherwise, the future of humanity is mostly tragic.</p>
<p>Of the aforementioned Four Freedoms for Humanity called for by the late President Roosevelt of the United States, the third is economic, and the fourth is half economic. Now it has been nine months since the day of Germany's surrender, and it has also been five months since the day of Japan's surrender. Has the freedom from want already been obtained by the victorious nations? (The defeated nations will not be discussed for the time being.) We must admit "not yet." Again, has freedom from fear been obtained by the various countries? Because the problem of international control of atomic energy has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, we must again admit "not yet"; and it seems that the psychology of the people of various countries is even more afraid that the use of new weapons such as atomic bombs will ruthlessly destroy human civilization completely.</p>
<p>As for the Seven Freedoms for Humanity put forward by the former Vice President Wallace of the United States, the first five are all about economics. Since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan, have the people of the world, regardless of whether they are victors or losers, already obtained these five economic freedoms? We can again answer bluntly and domestically: "Not yet." However, the fifth freedom, freedom from fear of overproduction, is generally not a problem for most countries in the world except the United States. Because they are currently in the aftermath of war, devastated, desolate, and fundamentally have nothing to do with overproduction. However, after the restoration of vitality in the future, perhaps there will be a problem of overproduction again, just as it was staged during the world economic panic around 1930.</p>
<p>In fact, all human beings have a desire for survival. The cause of war lies in seeking the survival of the people of the belligerent countries, and the end of war and the restoration of peace also lie in seeking the continued survival of the people of the belligerent countries (regardless of victorious or defeated countries). As for the constant research, discussion, and advocacy of plans for a permanent peaceful society by philosophers and scholars throughout history, their purpose is also to seek the survival of humanity, that is, what the national father Sun Yat-sen called the Principle of the People's Livelihood. (The so-called Principle of the People's Livelihood is the principle of "the people's livelihood, the survival of society, the people's livelihood, and the life of the masses.") If the Principle of the People's Livelihood can truly be fully realized in all countries of the world (not just China), then the five kinds of human economic freedom and security called for by Wallace above (in fact, security and freedom cannot be separated, without security there is no freedom, and without freedom there is no security) will naturally not be a problem. There is no fear of unemployment, no fear of old age and destitution, no fear of disease and hunger, no fear of class struggle, and no fear of overproduction of necessities leading to bankruptcy and panic among producers.</p>
<p>However, the various post-war chaotic phenomena that are presented to our eyes in various parts of the world are actually imbalances and frictions within the inevitable transitional period from the mobilization state of the wartime period to the demobilization state of the peace period. After the unprecedented catastrophe of the Second World War, mankind must learn from its pain and think of all kinds of ways to avoid the even more tragic and more immense sacrifices of the Third World War (because the Third World War must be an inhumane atomic energy war). We must think of all kinds of ways to obtain the Four Freedoms or Seven Freedoms of mankind - especially the five economic freedoms and security. We must think of all kinds of ways to realize the ideal realm and the Principle of the People's Livelihood of the Great Harmony World.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a citizen of the Republic of China, we must also make up our minds to strive to realize the National Father's Principle of the People's Livelihood at home and abroad. This will be our greatest and most effective contribution to domestic permanent peace and to world permanent peace.</p>
<p>From these perspectives, we must not only implement doctrine, but we must also implement the principle of livelihood at the same time. But there are many people who only know how to shout empty "democracy" slogans, while neglecting the "people's livelihood" principle, which is the most important spirit of the Three People's Principles. Even the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party say that they do not oppose capitalism, in an attempt to win the favor of private capitalists. Is this not extremely strange? We dare to remind everyone that if the eyes of politicians in China - and even the world - do not focus on the majority of ordinary people in the future, and single-mindedly plan for the economic freedom that they should obtain - that is, the freedom from want that the late President Roosevelt called for - and realize the happiness of people's livelihood that they should enjoy, even if the call for "democracy" is sung loudly, it will be difficult for the world to have permanent peace, and mankind will not be able to obtain the happiness of co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, we are willing to specially put forward "economic freedom" when people only know how to echo the fashionable term "democracy," and ask politicians to pay attention!</p>

<h3>Over Five Thousand Unemployed Workers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday; Deputy Mayor He and Others Provided Detailed Explanations, Hoping for Mutual Understanding, Mutual Love, and Labor-Capital Cooperation</h3>
<p>Approximately five thousand unemployed workers from various factories in Shanghai, representing sixty-two units, marched on Nanjing Road and other locations on the morning of the 22nd. At noon, they went to the Municipal Government to petition. They sent twenty-three representatives to meet with Mayor Qian, but the mayor was attending a meeting at the Songhu Garrison Headquarters due to official duties. Deputy Mayor He and Secretary-General Shen received them on behalf of the mayor, and invited Special Commissioner Zhang Zi from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Fan Caiqiu, the Organizing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Zhao Banfu, the Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Zhou Xuexiang, the Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, to participate in a meeting with the representatives in the Municipal Government conference room.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor He Responded to Each Item</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor He spoke first, saying that he had read the petitions from each unit and would provide detailed replies to the requests related to the Municipal Government's jurisdiction. He would ask Special Commissioner Zhang and Chief Secretary Zhao to respond separately to matters under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Social Affairs. Subsequently, he listened to the representatives' statements, which generally expressed the hope for a swift resumption of work, the priority hiring of original workers when factories resume operations, requests for relief for unemployed workers, and permission for unemployed workers to organize labor unions. Deputy Mayor He responded to each of the requests from the petitioning workers, providing detailed explanations, stating that the gradual resumption of work in the factories was the fundamental solution. Currently, the focus was on providing swift and widespread relief to unemployed workers. Regarding the distribution of flour from the Relief Goods Relief Administration, he had heard that the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs would distribute over three thousand bags daily in the eastern district and over one thousand bags daily in the western district, starting from the 20th of this month, and would continue to increase the area of distribution in the future to broaden the relief efforts. Regarding the issue of resuming work and prioritizing the hiring of original workers, he asked Special Commissioner Zhang to respond to everyone. In short, the government cared deeply for the workers and was particularly concerned about the unemployed workers. He sincerely hoped that factories could resume operations in the shortest possible time, and that unemployed workers would receive widespread relief before the resumption of work in various factories. Then, under the principle of mutual understanding and mutual love between labor and capital, cooperation should be implemented to increase various production and strive for local construction.</p>
<p>Priority Hiring is a Matter of Course</p>
<p>Following Deputy Mayor He, Special Commissioner Zhang Zi from the Ministry of Economic Affairs replied, stating briefly that the issue of resuming work for unemployed workers in Shanghai was not only a matter of urgency for everyone but also for the government. The gradual closure of factories in the city due to insufficient electricity began during the period of the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and had been occurring for two years. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan on August 10th of last year, the central government gradually took over the factories in Shanghai. From the date of the takeover on September 18th to October 11th, efforts were made to resume operations. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, cotton, and tobacco, it took time to comprehensively plan. The priority hiring of original workers in each factory was a matter of course. Factories to which factory directors had been appointed were currently preparing to resume operations. However, some factories had been transferred to the management of other agencies and were not within the scope of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; this should be discussed separately. Subsequently, Zhao Banfu, the Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, provided a detailed explanation of the procedures for distributing flour, hoping that the regulations would be followed so that unemployed workers could quickly obtain widespread relief.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang, the Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, then expressed his views, promising to take responsibility for resolving the difficulties of unemployed workers. Representatives from over sixty units selected seven representatives to maintain close contact with the General Labor Union. The representatives dispersed at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work to be Discussed This Morning</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM, Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi arrived to persuade and guide the workers. The workers requested a loan for one month's salary, which could be deducted after resuming work. Zhou Xuexiang agreed to forward the request to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification. As it was late, and no one was working at the Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he instructed the worker representatives to persuade the workers to go home first, and promised to negotiate the requests, in addition to those already answered by Deputy Mayor He. He hoped that the worker representatives would nominate representatives to continue discussing the resumption of work and relief measures this morning with Lu Jingshi, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and relevant authorities from the Social Bureau, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union. By 7:30 PM, the representatives conveyed the authorities' opinions, and the heads of each unit then dispersed.</p>
<p>Five Injured During the March</p>
<p>It was reported that the petitioning workers yesterday were from sixty-two factories, including Shanghai Industrial, Shanghai Iron and Steel, Donghua, and Gongxing, in Hongkou, Yangshupu, which were originally operated by enemy merchants. Since the victory, they had not resumed operations, and the unemployed workers had set out to march, passing through Yulin Road, Dalian Bay Road, Pingliang Road, and Daming Road. Upon reaching the Garden Bridge, three wine bottles fell from a tall building, injuring five workers: Shen Binggen, Gu Hengsheng, Zhang Daoliang, Shen Jingfan, and Cheng Dexi, from factories such as Yongbei, Toyota, and China Soap.</p>
<p>Most of the Requests Largely Resolved</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Guangqing, Lu Jingshi, Zhao Banfu, Fan Caiji, and Zhou Xuexiang convened worker representatives to discuss the results. Most of the conditions proposed by the workers were resolved: (1) Resumption of work: a seven-person committee will assist the Ministry of Economic Affairs in deciding on acceptance, and a solution can be obtained in two weeks. (2) Hiring of old workers: worker representatives will maintain order in the factories, and priority hiring will be given. (3) Relief: flour can be distributed within four days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Demonstrations Not Related to U.S. Military</h3>
<p>U.S. military headquarters announced yesterday: The U.S. military has officially received a letter from the Chinese government, clearly stating that the various student parades and demonstrations, worker strikes, etc., held in Shanghai have nothing to do with the U.S. military. Their main purpose is not to deal with the U.S. military, and they hope that the U.S. military will not misunderstand.</p>
<h3>Over 200,000 Spindles in Enemy-Owned Cotton Mills to Begin Operations After Takeover</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation, directly under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in Shanghai, it has gradually taken over enemy-owned cotton mills in the city, and has now largely completed the process. The number of spindles in operation is around 260,000. These cotton mills were previously managed by the Textile Group of the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region. Now that its mission is completed, it is beginning to wind up. However, since most of the original operating personnel possess technical expertise and experience, China Textile has decided to hire them as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Total Number of Registered Enemy Crimes Exceeds 20,000</h3>
<p>Since the District Court Procuratorate began registering enemy crimes in early November of last year, the number of cases has reached 21,813 as of the 21st of this month. In order to regulate the registration order, the office has issued numbers, with a maximum of 600 people per day. However, the numbers are issued every thousand people. Currently, the number for February 23rd has been issued. Among the registered crimes, "wanton destruction of property" is the most common. Victims can go to Penglai Road in Nanshi to identify enemy criminals. Today, more than ten people will identify them for the first time.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Congressional Study Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from North China; Scheduled to Leave for Manila Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[United Press, this city] A five-member U.S. Congressional study group and its staff arrived in Shanghai yesterday by plane from North China. The mission of this group is to investigate the situation of the U.S. military in various places, study the disposal of surplus overseas materials, U.S. military demobilization, and Pacific naval bases. According to the group's representative, Bates: In October of last year, Okinawa Island was hit by a hurricane, causing severe damage. Naval experts therefore do not intend to use the island as a naval base to avoid further wind disasters. Japanese troops are being repatriated, and during this period, it is hoped that there can be mutual understanding and unity in China. For the sake of world peace, China should not have another civil war. Japanese people in China are now being actively repatriated, and it is hoped that the U.S. military stationed in China can be demobilized and return home within four to five months. Colonel Weidman is currently responsible for repatriating the Japanese. It is said that there are currently 185 U.S. Liberty-type transport ships and landing craft, driven by Japanese, constantly sailing to Japan to transport Japanese people back to their country. By the end of March of this year, the number of Japanese returning home can reach 25,000 per day. The presence of the U.S. military in China is stabilizing. The four representatives of this country believe that if the U.S. government is determined to occupy Pacific bases to form the outer perimeter of the United States, the United States may try to make these islands self-sufficient. When the group arrived at the airport, those who went to welcome them included Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The group is now scheduled to leave for Manila tomorrow morning, the 24th, after which they will meet again with Kirk and General Weidmeyer, and the time has also been arranged.</p>
<h3>Fang Zude's Case is Rescheduled for Retrial; Denies Serving as a Translator</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Fang Zude, who formerly served as a driver and translator for the enemy gendarmerie in Wusong, is alleged to have used the power of the enemy and puppet regime to forcibly purchase the house of Wang Deqin, a local resident. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities on charges of treason and transferred to the court, and Wang also wants to recover the property according to law. The case was once tried, and the defendant denied oppressing the villagers and serving as a translator. Because Wang Deqin did not appear, the court ordered that the hearing be postponed. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the case was reopened by Judge Liu Yugui. Wang Deqin appeared in court and narrated how Fang borrowed the name of the enemy gendarmerie to forcibly purchase the house. When questioned, the intermediary Wang Hesheng claimed that Wang Deqin first wanted to sell the house, and then he contacted Fang, so the transaction was completed, not a forced purchase. Subsequently, Zhu Yongkang, the defendant's lawyer, submitted Fang's driver's license, proving that Fang was not employed as a translator, and attached a letter of guarantee from the joint businesses and residents of Wusong Town, proving that Fang had not exploited the villagers in the past. The court ruled that the recovery of property was not under the jurisdiction of the criminal court. Wang Deqin can file a lawsuit in the civil court of the District Court, and a joint hearing will be held again on the afternoon of the 25th. Also, this morning, the case of Zou Zhigao, a traitor, will be heard.</p>
<h3>China's Representative to the International Labor Conference, Zhu Xuefan, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhu Xuefan, China's representative to the Paris International Labor Conference, arrived in Shanghai by military plane at 7:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Deng Fa, and Ms. Li Pei, the secretary. Chen Jiakang, the representative to the London World Youth Conference, and others also came along.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to Chongqing a few days ago on official business to pay his respects to the central authorities and make requests. It is now learned that Wu has completed his official business in Chongqing and flew back to Shanghai yesterday. He will take office at the bureau soon.</p>
<h3>Factories Moving Inland Request Hu Xiyuan to Stay in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The members of the Joint Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi, who have come to Shanghai, have recently heard that Hu Xiyuan, the Director of the Committee of the National Industrial Restoration Association of China, will be flying to Peiping soon. They have successively requested Hu to postpone his trip. Yesterday, the Board of Directors of the Association decided to write to Hu to postpone his trip to Peiping, because the restoration of factories in Shanghai and various follow-up measures require Hu to preside over them in Shanghai. It is heard that Hu may postpone his trip to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Appointed President of the Three Teachings Moral Society</h3>
<p>The Three Teachings Moral Society was founded in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Recently, in order to expand its affairs, Wang Xiaolai was invited to serve as president. Wang took office at the society at 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Passengers Traveling to Qingdao Must Have Vaccination Certificates; Health Bureau Sends Out Vaccination Teams</h3>
<p>Since the entry into spring in this city, the weather has been erratic, resulting in abnormal phenomena. Therefore, smallpox is very prevalent. The health authorities attach great importance to this and are actively launching an epidemic prevention campaign. They have dispatched 100 medical and technical personnel to organize mobile vaccination teams to provide free services to citizens. The shipping industry in this city has received a notice from the Qingdao shipping administration that passengers landing in Qingdao from now on must have vaccination certificates. Without such certificates, they will be refused landing.</p>
<p>The Wusong branch of the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station resumed work on the 16th. Imported ships with contagious diseases are all inspected. Because two foreign ships from Seattle have recently discovered smallpox, Yangtze River sailors, except those who have been vaccinated recently, must be vaccinated.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to Postpone the Collection of Deed Tax in This City to Reduce the Burden on the People in the Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the postponement of the collection of deed tax in this city: "The above briefly states that the detailed rules for the implementation of deed tax in this city were formulated in accordance with the regulations on the management of deed tax in the recovered provinces and cities promulgated by the Executive Yuan. However, deed tax is a central tax and should be collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau, which is completely separate from the cleaning up of land rights in this city. Now the Land Administration Bureau is holding it at the same time as the first land ownership registration, which easily causes misunderstandings among the people, and the registration fee and the relatively high deed tax are paid at the same time. For deeds established during the period when this city was occupied, if they are valued in counterfeit currency, the deed tax should be collected according to the price estimated by the Land Administration Bureau, up to 200 times the price estimated by the pseudo-Land Administration Bureau for 30 years, which makes people even more afraid. Since the Land Administration Bureau began processing land registration on November 19th of last year, those who have applied for registration have not been very enthusiastic. The biggest reason is that the land registration in this city has been hindered by the Land Administration Bureau's implementation of the detailed rules for the management of deed tax, proving that Article 22 of the Outline of Land Administration Implementation Procedures in various provinces and cities stipulates that "during the registration period, unregistered white deeds should be allowed to report taxes on a deferred basis and should be exempt from penalties," and Article 7 of the Interim Measures for Handling the Registration of Permanent Lease Deeds or Tao Deeds in this city stipulates that the attention is purely on reducing the burden on the people in order to promote the completion of the land administration implementation procedures. From the perspective of encouraging land registration, it is appropriate not to collect deed tax in this city. Furthermore, in order to show consideration for the people's economic suffering during the war, the government has explicitly ordered the exemption of land value tax and land tax for one year in the 34th year. There is no reason why the purpose of the Land Law cannot be exempted together. In summary: (1) In order to reduce the tax burden on the people in the recovered areas, (2) In order to take into account that the real estate in Shanghai has been commoditized, and freezing it will cause serious problems in the financial sector, (3) In order to make the land registration process agile and eliminate unnecessary concerns of the people, (4) In order to comply with the original intention of exempting land tax and land tax, we should ask your ministry to approve and consult with the municipal government to inform the Land Administration Bureau of this city to postpone the collection of deed tax. The following is omitted."</p>

<h3>The Brave Soldiers of the 14th Division of the New Sixth Army Will Be Divided into Three Batches to Go to the Northeast; Division Commander Long Hosts a Reception for News Reporters; This Newspaper's Reporter, Mai Tian</h3>
<p>"The 14th Division of the New Sixth Army has been in Shanghai for three months. This time, we were ordered to transfer to the Northeast. We are grateful that members of the press have come to see us off. Every officer and soldier of the 14th Division is extremely grateful. In particular, we will fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to us by the central government and work harder to repay your kindness. During these three months, the soldiers may have neglected something, and the officers may not have managed things perfectly. I hope you will forgive and guide us so that the army and the people can become one. I am very grateful in my heart. We are the national army, and we must fulfill our responsibility to protect the people." Division Commander Long Tianwu's passionate remarks made us feel infinitely excited and moved.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Defeated Stubborn Enemies; Outstanding Achievements</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the reception room of the 14th Division headquarters at the old site of Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao, Xujiahui, was crowded with more than fifty reporters and officers. The atmosphere of warmth and integration was rarely seen in previous press conferences after the victory.</p>
<p>The 14th Division has a long history of more than ten years and has made great contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the Battle of Myitkyina, the officers and soldiers of the 14th Division made heroic sacrifices and were loyal to the country, reaching four to five thousand people. They have been to India, Burma, and various parts of Southwest and Central China. After being assisted by the British army and equipped with the latest equipment, the 14th Division was renamed the New 14th Division.</p>
<p>The first batch of the 22nd Division of the New Sixth Army began on the 16th and departed in two batches on the 19th for four days by U.S. landing craft. They have now reached their destination. If the port is not frozen, the planned landing site is Huludao, and the journey is four days, if the weather is calm.</p>
<p>Transported in Batches; Orderly</p>
<p>The 14th Division will be dispatched in three batches this time. The first batch of more than 5,000 people will be transported on six ships, each ship carrying about 700 to 900 people. They have already boarded the ships yesterday and will depart this morning. Yesterday, when boarding the ship, there were also U.S. naval officers and three U.S. senators visiting the Gonghexiang Wharf. Under the supervision of the U.S. military, their transportation was completely regulated and orderly. For example, weapons and ammunition were transported completely within the 24 hours from 8:00 AM on the 20th to 8:00 AM on the 21st, luggage and personal weapons were transported within the 24 hours of the second day, and soldiers and accompanying luggage were transported completely within the 24 hours of the third day. Before boarding the ship, the soldiers also underwent disinfection and preventive injections. What they eat on the ship is dry food, salted fish, pickles, etc. Each ship has two gas stoves, which can cook for 60 people at a time, so meals are served on the ship all day long. The second batch will transport the headquarters personnel and is scheduled to board the ship on the 25th. These three batches are all strategic troops. Other vehicles and donkeys and horses in the Changsha area are still being transported continuously.</p>
<p>Five Female Comrades Serve with the Army</p>
<p>There are 20 political workers in the 14th Division, five of whom are female comrades. They also wear military uniforms and will also depart this time. Most of their current work is performing plays and nursing. These five female comrades are all under the age of 25, have a secondary education, and were all recruited in Hunan. Their monthly salary is around 10,000 yuan. Yang Zongyi, a political officer, is a reporter for the Chongqing Xinshu Daily. They all joined voluntarily. Judging from the energetic spirit of Officer Yang and the others, we know that they are making great contributions in the army.</p>
<p>In the open space, seven or eight strong men specially put on leather coats, leather hats, and leather gloves, which are the winter clothes of the New Sixth Army after arriving in the Northeast. So, the photographers were busy again.</p>
<p>All Kinds of New Equipment</p>
<p>Next, we were invited to Jiaotong University to visit their latest weapons and equipment, including heavy and light machine guns, submachine guns, rocket launchers, mortars, flat-firing guns, rifle grenades, and new wireless radios. The soldiers were busy preparing to leave, so we didn't have the opportunity to see other equipment. Seeing those majestic soldiers, I believe that Division Commander Long's words "take on the responsibilities entrusted by the central government... fulfill the responsibility of protecting the people" will definitely be successful. I congratulate our new China, and I wish those brave men a smooth journey and serve the country.</p>
<h3>Jiangfu Maru Sinks After Hitting Mine Off Wusong Port While Transporting Japanese Nationals; U.S. Warship Rescues, Most Japanese Saved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Japanese ship Jiangfu Maru, carrying 4,279 Japanese prisoners of war and nationals to be repatriated to Japan, was originally scheduled to leave the port the day before yesterday, but was postponed to early yesterday morning due to lack of time. Unexpectedly, the ship struck a drifting sea mine 30 miles outside the port of Wusong and exploded immediately. The Japanese captain of the ship immediately sent an emergency distress signal, stating that the entire ship would be destroyed if it could not be rescued within two hours. The U.S. warship "White River" was the first to receive the telegram and sailed to the scene of the incident to provide rescue. Xie Haoling, the interim commander of the Shanghai port, told this newspaper's reporter that the Japanese prisoners of war and nationals on the ship were rescued by the U.S. warship. Except for a very small number who went missing, they were all safe. They are now being transported back to the Yangshupu Wharf by the U.S. warship. However, most of the rescued Japanese people had their clothes soaked. I have requested instructions from the authorities and will go to take care of them this morning. Also yesterday, in addition to the "Jiangfu Maru," three U.S. landing craft and the Japanese ship "Rongfeng Maru" transported a batch of more than 8,000 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back to their country.</p>
<h3>US Military Tribunal to Try Japanese War Criminals; Officially Begins This Morning; General Middleton Appointed Chief Presiding Officer</h3>
<p>The US War Crimes Tribunal was originally scheduled to conduct a preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals at Tilanqiao Prison yesterday morning. However, due to the incomplete arrangement of the courtroom, the hearing has been rescheduled to officially begin at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>All war criminals in the prison are under strict surveillance. The six-story prison has heavily guarded entrances and is surrounded by stone walls and iron gates. Each prisoner is confined to their cell. Aside from military police patrolling the corridors with iron locks, there is no sound. The Japanese individuals involved in the killing of American pilots are particularly distraught. Their faces are expressionless when encountering people, their fate is in the hands of the American military judges. In two or three weeks, we can expect the answer of "the killer dies".</p>
<p>Trial According to Law</p>
<p>The US Army Headquarters announced yesterday that the US War Crimes Tribunal is scheduled to formally conduct the preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals at the Tilanqiao Prison courtroom at 10:00 AM this morning. The first case will involve the trial of seven principal Japanese war criminals who killed American airmen in Hankou, along with eleven related personnel, totaling eighteen individuals. The US military has appointed General Middleton, former commander of the US Training Group, head of the US Personnel Evacuation Service, and current commander of the US Military Supply Department, as the chief presiding officer. Other judges include Colonel Spink, Colonel Auster, Colonel Gaddo, and Lieutenant Colonel Misar. The prosecuting attorney is Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, assisted by Captain Garland. The defense attorney is Lieutenant Colonel Coggins, assisted by Captain Rivelle. All proceedings will be based on legal provisions and the truth of the events. The reason for the prosecution of these Japanese prisoners is: "On December 16, 1944, they killed American pilots with cruel and inhumane methods, violating international law. The real names of the killed American pilots have not yet been found, but there are clues being investigated. On the day of the trial, US Air Force Captain Ronison will testify, and many US soldiers will attend as observers."</p>
<h3>Italian Lawyer Denny Acquitted and Released</h3>

<h3>Korean Military Government Representative to Assist in the Evacuation of Korean Nationals</h3>
<p>[United Press Report] Colonel Wideman, director of the US Army Repatriation Group, stated that a formal representative of the US Military Government in Korea will be sent to China to assist in the repatriation of Korean nationals. Wideman recently consulted with US authorities in Tokyo and preparations have been made for the evacuation of 4,000 Koreans in the Shanghai area and 6,000 Koreans in the North China area. He stated: "We have requested that the military government limit the Korean evacuees to those who are truly impoverished and that those who wish to return for political or other personal reasons should not be allowed to board American ships. We have been notified that two Koreans and one American representative will be sent to China to be responsible for most of the planning work."</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Supply in Zhabei Under Active Restoration</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Before the war, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had a water plant and a power plant on Jungong Road in Zhabei, supplying water and electricity to Zhabei, Wusong, Dachang, Luodian and other districts. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the plant site and water and electricity facilities were all located in the war zone. In addition to the destruction of the two water and electricity plants, other facilities such as water pipes, electrical wires, and utility poles were even more severely damaged. Since the victory, the company has actively searched for various materials and diligently carried out repairs. However, there is still a shortage of general materials, which has affected the progress of the repair work. It is expected that the power generation work will have to be delayed for several months before there is any indication of progress. Currently, the company's water supply can barely meet the needs of users. The source of electricity is temporarily supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, so the company has the difficult experience of not being able to satisfy the external requests for water and electricity restoration. Recently, although the company has obtained a loan of 200 million yuan from the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it still feels that it is insufficient. It is hoped that the government can provide manpower and material assistance. Currently, the company's water and electricity revenue can barely maintain costs, but the electricity revenue is often at a loss.</p>

<p>Public Sale of Soap</p>
<p>5,000 boxes of Xiangmao soap are being sold at low prices. The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration has entrusted the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association to distribute them. 1,000 tobacco exchange stores throughout the city are scheduled to start selling them this afternoon. Each pack is priced at 150 yuan, and each person is limited to one pack, while supplies last.</p>
<p>Rice Price Limit</p>
<p>The Grain Administration Commissioner's Office recently released 5,000 bags of Wuhu Xian rice, distributing them to the San Tai Rice Company in this city for distribution and sale at a low price to rice shops throughout the city. The price is limited to 7,500 yuan per bag, and rice shops can add a profit of 8%. The rice shops have already started making payments yesterday and can pick up the goods, which will be sold this week.</p>
<h3>Cloth will be Sold Again at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Since the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Districts entrusted the Jianghai Customs to count the warehouses, the quantity of materials stored in each warehouse is quite considerable. For the cloth item alone, there are already about 10 million bolts. In addition to the 200,000 bolts that the Administration has gradually handled for low-priced sales and a portion transported to Chongqing and Taiwan for exchange of materials, the authorities have planned to handle the remaining portion for low-priced sales and complete the low-priced sales within three months.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Inspection Begins</h3>
<p>Starting on the 20th of this month, the stamp tax in this city will be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Yuan (government). Violations will be punished according to law. It is reported that the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has appointed stamp tax inspectors to inspect the books and documents used by various industrial and commercial firms in different districts. If stamp duty has not been paid in accordance with the regulations, the illegal documents will be transferred to the court for punishment once discovered. The bureau will still allow a one-time supplementary tax application for stamp-duty-omitted documents during the promotion period to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Orders Ten Ocean Vessels from the US; Expected to Arrive in China by the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Xu Xueyu, general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in addition to receiving Victory-class vessels, the company has also purchased ten "N3" type ocean vessels from the United States. Each vessel has a tonnage of approximately 3,000 tons. These vessels were all built around 1944 and are expected to arrive in China by the end of next month. The Bureau plans to deploy these ocean vessels on the North and South Ocean lines and to Taiwan. However, these vessels are all cargo ships with a lack of passenger capacity. Therefore, it has been decided to build two additional passenger ships, each weighing approximately 2,000 tons, specifically for the Yangtze River. The Bureau has already started designing and prototyping, and will soon commission the Jiangnan Shipyard to build them. The Bureau has recently planned to purchase three more vessels from the United States (mostly Norwegian ships), each weighing approximately 2,000 tons, and five vessels from Denmark, each weighing approximately 6,000 tons.</p>
<p>Jiangshun Steamer Runs Aground Again</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level is low and navigation is difficult. The Changxing steamer of the Sanbei Company previously ran aground in Dongliu and could not be towed for a while. Later, all the passengers and cargo were unloaded, and the ship was towed out. The merchants and passengers were then transported to Hankou by barge. The ship will return to Shanghai around this Friday. The Jiangshun steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, traveling downstream from Hankou, also ran aground in Dongliu. The Bureau received the news and is trying to rescue it. The Yisheng steamer of the British-owned Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., is making its first trip to Shanghai after the war. It is expected to arrive outside the Wusongkou last night and will enter the port at 2:00 PM today. It is scheduled to dock at the Taikoo Wharf on Zhongshan East 2nd Road. After the passengers disembark, it will move to Qichang Depot to unload cargo and is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong. The Yongsheng steamer has already departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port this Sunday. It is reported that the next voyage of the ship will be to Tanggu.</p>
<p>Fire at a Nanshi Oil Factory</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Daming Oil Factory at No. 1 Jingsheng Lane, Wanyu Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, caught fire yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:50 PM.

The firefighters from the North District Fire Department rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about an hour and a half. The fire starter, Xia Jinlong, was arrested by the police and taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Barge Fire</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM last night, a large barge was docked at Pier No. 7 on the west side of Xinzha Bridge, loaded with several empty gasoline barrels. A cigarette butt ignited a barrel, causing a sudden fire. A crew member named Wang Baoxiang was burned on the head and face while trying to put out the fire.

He had dinner at the Hongyun Restaurant on Jinling Road the previous day and took a Route 1 tram home. When the tram reached the vicinity of the Eight Immortals Bridge, a pickpocket suddenly snatched Zhao’s hat from outside the tram and fled. Zhao jumped out of the tram window to chase after him. However, after jumping out, he fell to the ground and injured his lungs. He was dying. The police arrived and sent him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, but he died soon after.</p>
<h3>Tram Ticket Sales; Strict Prohibition of Arrogant Attitude</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau of this city previously received complaints that tram and bus ticket sellers were arrogant towards passengers.

<h3>Lack of Special Stimulation in the Market, Initial Fatigue Followed by Stability; US Dollar Weakens, Hong Kong Dollar Slightly Strengthens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market did not break away from its old tune. Large investors were selling gold for stocks, and blindly following retail investors continued to cut their losses. However, because the market has the strength of next-day delivery, it maintained the style of the previous day. The market was most tired at noon, but the result was stable. Lacking special stimulation, the trend was very mediocre. The market opened flat, hovering around 890,000. Near noon, the multi-party began to panic. The chips were originally loose due to selling, and at noon they fell to 877,000. The initial market was still flat, but when the next-day delivery rose slightly at low prices, it rose to 890,000 in the small market. The result was a slight setback of 1,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 95,000, silver at 750, and silver dollars around 460. The unofficial discount was still tight, with a premium of about 9 to 12 cents.</p>
<p>The US dollar was supported by hedging, and there were many people exchanging gold for cash. However, a certain industrial company in Sichuan poured out a lot of spot goods, so it followed the gold price and slightly weakened. In the afternoon, the gold market was assisted by futures and slightly recovered. The US dollar was still standing firm at noon because it was settled in cash, so the result was a slight setback of 4 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar gradually stabilized. The old bills recovered slightly by 2 yuan. The transaction was limited. The new bills once showed a strong willingness to sell, with the "1" series rising to around 75 yuan, and the "2" series at 73 yuan. However, there was a lack of buyers, and in the afternoon it recovered slightly. The result was a slight increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous close. The Australian pound was priced at 3,500 for buying and 300 for the Ruble, with an additional 10% for selling. However, there was no market for large-denomination Ruble bills.</p>
<h3>Large Investors Putting in Effort to Boost Prices, Chinese Stocks Continue to Strive</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks opened strongly, continuing the momentum of the previous day's afternoon. Guang Gang successively released Yong Spinning, transferring to Wing On Company, causing the company to rise repeatedly from around 900 yuan to above 1150 yuan. For other popular stocks, large investors released some of their holdings at high prices, and at noon there was a floating multi-party scramble for position. Yong Spinning retreated from 1800 yuan (this price has reached the predetermined target of 500 shares for 10 taels of gold) to 1620 yuan, Mei Ya retreated from 1160 yuan to 990 yuan, Xin Guang Jing Fu retreated from 85 yuan to 78 yuan, and Zhong Spinning retreated from 780 yuan to 700 yuan. However, in the moment of market closing in the afternoon, large investors forcefully raised the price, and Yong Spinning recovered its old look. The three small popular stocks recovered less due to limited time and resources. The noon closing result was 80 yuan better for Yong Spinning, a small 10 yuan for Mei Ya, the three small popular stocks rose slightly, and the company rose by 300 yuan. The afternoon asking price still made progress under the hands of large investors.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still encouraged by Chinese stock speculators, and buyers were diligent. Small and medium-sized stocks continued to progress, but large stocks were less common and not excited. The noon closing result was slightly higher for small and medium-sized stocks, while large stocks saw a slight setback for Jardine Matheson and a slight increase for Ewo Spinning.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Fall Again</h3>
<p>Government bonds were very mediocre. Retail investors continued to sell, seeing a further decline. However, B-bonds had short-covering at low prices, and a recovery was easily seen after the low. As a result, B-bonds were still down 30 yuan, and miscellaneous brands fell by 100 yuan each for A and B due to a lack of speculation, 120 yuan for D-bonds, and only 70 yuan for E-bonds.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market changed from sluggish to stable, and wholesale transactions were no longer easy. Low-end grey cloth and fine cloth were hot-filled, slightly hardened, but it was also a temporary expedient, with little turnover. The buyer group had plans to return home, so the market was also scarce, and the trend could be stable until the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Fall; Flower Market Has a Slight Decoration</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was still sluggish. Many peers were still willing to lower prices to sell. Customer sales did not improve, resulting in another decrease of 20,000 for each yarn count. Only the price of 20-count Jinqiao yarn remained unchanged at 570,000, because there was a Hankou customer who specifically requested this brand, and the factory was holding out for the original price, so the price did not fall. The opening price for Spinning and Construction Zhu became less common, and there were fewer buyers, because those in the industry had already bought old brand yarns from the Japanese factories of various companies, which were not only losing money every day, but also encountering difficulties when delivering goods, so they were hesitant to move forward.</p>
<p>The current cotton market is still flat. Manufacturers are still only decorating transactions. Chinese factories imported 42-count raw material American cotton midling grade flowers priced at 85,000 yuan, 32-count raw material Dachongji flowers priced at 80,000 yuan, both of which were factory prices. Flower shops imported 20-count raw material Tongzhou flowers priced at 66,000 yuan, and 10-count raw material Yuyao flowers priced at 50,000 yuan, both of which were wharf prices. There were no reports of goods arriving at the dock.</p>
<h3>Raw Material Allocation for Silk Factories; Rayon Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Factory Sutra Stands Still as Silk Goods are Sluggish</p>
<p>The rumor that rayon raw materials will be allocated to silk factories has been confirmed. The spot market fell sharply yesterday. 120-count Sky Bridge opened at 1.18 million yuan, then fell to 1.11 million yuan. Transactions were few. It closed at 1.07 million yuan. The advance was sharp and the retreat was continuous. In the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly restored and traded at 1.12 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan from the previous day. The machine study opened at 790,000 yuan. It is far from the current product building. A buyer entered for 390,000, Yuan was raised to 400,000. The price of factory sutras still stands still and has a very profitable image. The price of the silk web products are soft throughout and transactions are very rare.

<h3>British and American Traders Inquire; Tea Merchants Have No Goods to Offer; Green Tea Sales are Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) According to tea industry sources, British and American trading companies in this city have repeatedly received overseas telegrams stating that there is a great demand for Ping-shui pearl tea and Qimen tea, and they all intend to pre-order. However, tea merchants in this city, considering that it is not easy to find a considerable amount of tea raw materials at present, are still unwilling to give a definite reply. Generally, it is necessary to wait until next spring to start.</p>
<p>Recently, customer groups have had a very strong demand for red and green tea varieties, and especially green tea. Places such as Tianjin and Yingkou almost accept all comers, resulting in prices rising day by day, with a great sense of endlessness. As for black tea, although there are fewer inquiries than green tea, the market is stable and lacks change, but the bottom is solid.</p>
<h3>Liquor Tax Increased by 60%</h3>
<p>The government authorities have recently announced that all foreign liquor must be subject to a 60% unified liquor tax, from locally brewed Russian wine to imported Scotch whiskey, and no exemptions are allowed. The locally brewed liquor is paid by the brewing manufacturer, and the foreign imported liquor is paid by the foreign liquor retailer. The reason for this tax method is that it is very difficult to collect from users in the market, and it is easy to evade taxes. Therefore, from today, all kinds of foreign liquor will be increased by 60% to cope with this situation. This unified tax will also have a stamp affixed to the liquor bottle to show that the tax has been paid.</p>
<h3>Grain Administration Throws Out Wú Rice; Rice Market Rally Slightly Sets</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's rice price was very strong on this street because there were fewer arrivals and stomachs were full. Taking advantage of the continuous rise, the price rose again. At the opening, thick japonica rice reached 10,500 yuan. There were more buyers than sellers, and there was still a rising sign. The Grain Administration Office of this city threw out a large batch of banana rice due to the excessive rise, first opening at 8,500 yuan, but there was no transaction, and gradually dropped to 7,500 yuan, with a transaction of about 10,000 stones. This street has absorbed some, and the thick japonica and thin rice had to change from rising to fatigue. Japonica rice fell by 200-300 yuan, early thin rice fell by 400-500 yuan, indica rice fell by 500-600 yuan, and white yuan also fell by 200-300 yuan. The oil market was both strong and weakened, and continued to rise by hundreds of yuan. Soybeans were stagnant, and the price fell slightly by 100-200 yuan. The market had few transactions. Soybean cake was tired and did not open. Flour transactions turned tired, adding a small 100-200 yuan. The liquor market had quite active year-end sales, and the price rose again by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Legal Principle of Returning Confiscated Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The enemy and puppet regime's confiscated yarn and cloth are essentially stolen goods. The portion that has already been illegally disposed of cannot be returned to the original owners immediately and awaits future claims for compensation. The remaining portion should naturally be returned to the original owners. It is absolutely unacceptable to confiscate all remaining stolen goods simply because the original items cannot be identified. Although the brands and names of the yarn and cloth may vary, they can be proportionally returned with goods of the same type, quantity, or quality.</p>
<p>Even if the enemy and puppet regime paid a small sum of money when confiscating the yarn and cloth, the amount is so minimal that it cannot compensate for the entire loss, being less than one or two percent of the original value. Logically, the meager sum received under duress cannot be considered full consideration, and the right to request the return of the goods should not be forfeited. Even if, legally speaking, the money received by the yarn and cloth merchants at the time is considered a form of enemy property, allowing the yarn and cloth merchants to return it in proportion after the remaining confiscated goods are returned, and then confiscating it by the state, would be something the yarn and cloth merchants would consider.</p>
<p>In conclusion, returning the yarn and cloth confiscated by the enemy and puppet regime is proper both morally and legally. As for the method of returning them, it requires careful handling by the authorities. (Wang Xiaowen)</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st) The Committee for the Inventory of Cultural Relics of Puppet Organizations, jointly established by cultural and educational institutions in Nanjing, held a plenary meeting at the Ministry of Education at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Chaired by Anti-Director Li Wu, the meeting adopted inventory methods and decided to dispatch personnel from various institutions to begin inventorying sealed locations starting on the 25th. Each institution may nominate supervisory personnel to prevent malfeasance. It is expected to be completed in one and a half months.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Nanjing News) In order to unseal, inventory, and receive sealed cultural relics in the Nanjing area, the Ministry of Education convened a meeting of representatives from relevant institutions in the conference room of the Ministry of Education from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 21st, chaired by Vice Minister Hang Liwu.</p>
<p>Key points of discussion: The organizational charter, detailed rules, and work implementation methods of the Nanjing District Committee for the Inventory, Reception, and Sealing of Cultural Relics of the Ministry of Education were adopted. It is reported that the committee will generally consist of over ten members, with a representative from the Ministry of Education serving as the chairman.

The unsealing will proceed starting with institutions that are smaller in scope and simpler in work. The sequence will generally be as follows: (1) Puppet Astronomical and Meteorological Affairs Committee, (2) Puppet Central Library, (3) Puppet Museum Affairs Committee, (4) Puppet Library Affairs Committee. After unsealing and completing the inventory procedures, cultural relics belonging to various institutions will be claimed by the original institutions based on certificates and after review, they will be retrieved within a reasonable period. Private cultural relics that should be returned should be registered in advance, and after a public announcement, applications should be submitted according to the schedule.</p>
<p>Unsealing Office: The committee has been established at the Central National Library at No. 48 Chengxian Street and is scheduled to begin preparations and office work from the 23rd (Wednesday), and to begin unsealing and inventorying sealed cultural relics on the 25th (Friday), following the order mentioned above, first unsealing the cultural relics sealed by the Puppet Astronomical and Meteorological Affairs Committee, and then the others.

<h3>Changes in Landscape Painting Style</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Landscape painting originated in the Jin Dynasty. Emperor Ming's "Swift Boat on the River," Wei Xie's "Banquet at Yaochi," Dai Da's "Wu Zhong Streams and Mountains Dwelling," and Gu Kaizhi's "Snow-Covered Five Old Peaks" are all among the earliest renowned works of landscape painting. However, most served as backgrounds for figure paintings, with only Gu Kaizhi progressing from using landscapes as backgrounds for figure paintings to creating independent landscape paintings, thus earning him the title of the ancestor of Chinese landscape painters. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, landscape painting further progressed and became purely independent, with dedicated landscape painters such as Zong Bing, Wang Wei, and Emperor Yuan of Liang, all of whom wrote treatises on landscape painting. After the Tang Dynasty, landscape painting diverged into Northern and Southern schools, with styles evolving from rough and simple to elaborate and detailed, and from deep and vibrant colors to light and elegant hues. Li Sixun and his son's blue-green landscape paintings were the founders of the Northern School, while Wang Wei's ink landscape paintings were the leaders of the Southern School.</p>
<p>The most notable landscape painters of the Five Dynasties period were Jing Hao, Guan Tong, and , their style changed to being antique and profound. Other Northern School painters were also influenced by the Southern School's ink paintings, gradually becoming assimilated. Therefore, during the Liang, Tang, Jin, Han, Zhou, and the Five Dynasties period, there were very few purely Northern School painters. In the Northern Song Dynasty, paintings from the dynasties mentioned above became the origin for the paintings of Li Cheng and Fan Kuan, they were considered the three great masters of the Northern Song Dynasty. However, their styles varied: paintings from the original dynasties focused on ink and preferred to depict landscapes south of the Yangtze River, which Ju Ran imitated. Li Cheng used ink sparingly, preferring to depict distant, cold forests, with snow scenes being particularly outstanding. Xu Daoning and Guo Xi were both students of his. Fan Kuan preferred to paint tall ridges and dense forests, using deep and heavy strokes, creating elegant and secluded imagery. In addition, Mi Yuanzhang distantly imitated Wang Qia and closely followed the style of older paintings, covering the paper with jade-like textures, creating the unique Mi School cloud and mountain style, which was also a distinctive style of Northern Song landscape painting and belonged to the Southern School. After the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Boju, Li Tang, Liu Songnian, Li Song, and others flourished in the Painting Academy, their brushwork being delicate and moist, and their colors being primarily blue and green, known as the Academy style of painting, which was actually a branch of Li Sixun's blue-green style. At the same time, within the Academy style, Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, both of whom studied under Li Tang, used more ink, with rough and vigorous strokes, eschewing delicacy and moisture, creating a unique style of ruggedness, already influenced by Dong Yuan, Fan Kuan, and Mi Fu, abandoning the Northern and Southern schools for a unified approach. Landscape painting thus underwent another transformation.</p>
<p>In the early Yuan Dynasty, apart from a few such as Qian Xuan who continued the Southern Song Academy style, Zhao Mengfu was known for his delicate and moist style, but expressed with simplicity and directness. The styles of Gao Kegong, Cao Zhibai, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters – Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, and Wu Zhen – although with minor differences, did not stray beyond the scope of the Southern School, advocating a simple,淡然 (tranquil), and refreshing style. Entering the Ming Dynasty, landscape painting diversified into many schools, the most prominent being the Zhe School, the Academy School, and the Wu School. Dai Jin emulated the styles of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, forming the Zhe School, with Wu Wei and Shen Zhou being its leading figures. The Academy School, including Zhou Chen, Tang Yin, and Leng Qian, were all skilled in blue-green landscape, with brushwork more delicate and meticulous than the Zhe School, and with a gentle and elegant style. The Wu School, on the other hand, followed Wang Wei and subsequent masters such as Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Li Cheng, Mi Fu, Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters. Many were from Wu, thus it was named the Wu School, and included dozens of artists such as Dong Qichang, Chen Jiru, Xie Shichen, and Li Rihua. Their style was elegant and refined, distinct from the Zhe School and the Academy School.</p>
<p>Since the Qing Dynasty, the style of landscape painting has not undergone any significant changes or progress. The overall style generally follows the Southern School, with numerous branches and factions. The Four Wangs and Wu Yun are the leading figures in this, with those who imitated Dong Yuan and Mi Fu, using wetter brushwork and more moist ink, attributed to Dong Qichang, known as the Huating School. Those who emphasized dry brushwork and dry ink, following Yunlin, were called Shi Hongshi, known as the Xin'an School. Those who used loose and elegant brushwork, with warm and thick colors, following Dong Yuan, were attributed to Zhao Wendu, known as the Songjiang School. In addition, those who followed Xiao Yuncong were the Gushu School; those who followed Luo Mu formed the Jiangren Society, establishing schools based on location, but their styles were all related to the Southern School, moving within the styles of Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Mi Fu, Gao Kegong, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters, without much difference. Those who did not belong to these schools, with peculiar brushwork and uninhibited style, becoming masters in their own right and establishing their own banners, included Shi Tao, Shi Xi, and Bada Shanren. Furthermore, there were also titles such as the Nine Friends of Painting, the Eight Masters of Jinling, the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, the Ten Philosophers of Painting, and the Six Recluses of Kunling, each with their own merits.</p>
<h3>Textual Criticism and Commentary on Ling Tingkan's "Poems on Opera Quips" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The Emperor married them off in the palace,</p>
<p>The top scholar was hung in the back garden.</p>
<p>"Tears on Blue Robes" and "Record of Gold Coins,"</p>
<p>All allowed Linchuan to tread the same ground.</p>
<p>The original note says: "The Yuanxiao 'Tears on Blue Robes' ordered marriage in the palace, the 'Record of Gold Coins' cruelly interrogating Han Hong, are all sources for Tang Linchuan." According to this, "Tears on Blue Robes" was written by Ma Zhida, and "Record of Gold Coins" was written by Qiao Ji. Tang Linchuan refers to Tang Xianzu, and specifically his "Peony Pavilion" imitating Yuan opera. What was imitated from "Record of Gold Coins" is the famous line in the 52nd scene, "Hard interrogation," which some people can still sing today; what was imitated from "Tears on Blue Robes" is the Song Dynasty passage: "Du, the Pacifier, reported Liu's affair to the Emperor. Liu also submitted a memorial to defend himself. The two men argued in front of the palace. Liniang personally went to court, entrusting Chen, the Palace Attendant, to report the events of her rebirth. The Emperor used the truth-revealing mirror to determine whether Liniang was a human or a ghost, and inquired about the events before and after her death. As a result, the rebirth was confirmed, and the father and son, husband and wife, recognized each other, and by imperial decree, they were married, the whole family reunited." The origins of the "Peony Pavilion" story are explained in detail by Zhang Youluan's "Tang Xianzu and his Peony Pavilion," but the scene in "Tears on Blue Robes" has not yet been pointed out.</p>
<p>With nimble hands, new colored silk is spun,</p>
<p>Each one strives to embroider exquisite patterns.</p>
<p>Who knows that the plain white brocade,</p>
<p>Yields to the "Grain Selling in Chenzhou" lyrics.</p>
<p>Many are excellent in literary style. However, in terms of plain description (i.e., the natural style), none can surpass the anonymous "Grain Selling in Chenzhou." I seem to remember that the author of this play also had a name. The Tianyi Pavilion's Ghost Register seems to say that the author's name was Lu Dengshan. Ling's praise of this play must be his personal opinion.</p>
<p>Zhongxuan suddenly becomes the son-in-law of the Lord,</p>
<p>Pei Du once served as a "White Prime Minister."</p>
<p>If one insists on consulting historical records,</p>
<p>Then the Yuan drama's rules will scatter like tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>The original note says: "Yuan Dynasty plays often conflict with historical facts, showing their intention to create drama. Later generations are unaware of this and try to explain them away, which is absurd." This explains the author's attitude towards the inconsistencies between Yuan Dynasty plays and orthodox history. He believes that this is precisely one of the characteristics of Yuan Dynasty plays, that it is a wild art and does not need to adhere strictly to orthodox history. The following several poems express the same opinion. The first line refers to Zheng Guangzu's "Drunk Thinking of Home: Wang Can Ascends the Tower," which ends with Wang Can marrying Cai Yong's daughter. The second line refers to Zheng Guangzu's "The Prunus Blossom Maid Deceives the Hanlin Scholar's Romance." The character says: "My surname is Bai, my given name is Minzhong, and I am Bai Letian's younger brother. My father once campaigned in Huaixi with Duke Pei Du of Jin. Duke Jin said: 'I have a daughter, named Xiaoman, whom I will marry to your son Minzhong.'"</p>
<p>Bi Shi bares his heart like Ji Fu,</p>
<p>Yuanzang worships Buddha like Wu Changling.</p>
<p>The Star-Picking Tower and Tang Sanzang,</p>
<p>Don't laugh that all these words are unfounded.</p>
<p>This poem has the same intent as the one above. Bao Jifu wrote "Bi Shi Bares His Heart at the Star-Picking Tower," which likely influenced Xu Zhonglin's "Investiture of the Gods," as Xu Zhonglin used it as part of the materials for "Investiture of the Gods." Wu Changling wrote "Journey to the West," which has editions in the World Literature Library, the Complete Collection of Yuan Dynasty Drama, and the Gukou Wenying reprint.</p>
<p>Bawang burns the camp like Liang's genius,</p>
<p>Across the river, they fight wits at the Tortoiseshell Banquet.</p>
<p>Even today, the alleyways talk about the Three Kingdoms,</p>
<p>All from the tunes of Yuan Dynasty drama.</p>
<p>"Zhuge Liang Burns Bawang's Camp" and "Two Strategists Fight Wits Across the River" were both written by anonymous authors, both appearing in "Selections of Yuan Dynasty Opera - Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Hu Shi's research in his "Collected Essays" is the most detailed. Later, Sun Kaidi also wrote a specialized research paper, which is the most refined. Yuan Dynasty opera and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms - Spoken Version" are the closest. The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" by Luo Guanzhong, which is discussed in the alleys, is already a layer removed from Yuan Dynasty opera.</p>
<p>Is it real, is it drama, confused and misinformed,</p>
<p>A mayfly shaking a tree, unaware of its own limitations.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Bao Zheng of the Eastern Capital,</p>
<p>Wisely beheads Lu Su with a golden decree.</p>
<p>The original note says: "Yuan Dynasty Guan Hanqing and Yue Fei, often have extremely unreasonable and laughable elements, showcasing their style in this way. Recent authors value a lack of flaws, so they compensate and cover things up more and more, and stray further and further from the source." This statement captures the essence of Yuan Dynasty opera. Yuan Dynasty opera: "The text exists, its brilliance shines ten thousand feet. A mayfly shaking a large tree is laughable, unaware of its own limitations." The words used to comment on Li Bai and Du Fu can be used here. "Bao Zheng Wisely Beheads Lu Su," the "Selections of Yuan Drama" attributes to Guan Hanqing, but the "Ghost Register" and the "Orthodox Music Register" do not record it. The Garden Book also says it was written by an anonymous author. Whether Guan wrote it is questionable, but given Guan's works like "Magistrate Qian Wisely Dotes on Xie Tianxiang," "Du Ruiniang Wisely Appreciates the Golden Thread Pond," and "Magistrate Qian Investigates the Scarlet Robe," which love to use the word "Wisely," it is possible that Guan wrote it.</p>
<p>Shi Junmei is the originator of the chuanqi drama,</p>
<p>Chen Dasheng continues the legacy of the sanqu.</p>
<p>Waiting until the mid-Ming Dynasty,</p>
<p>Our family's lyricists achieved initial success.</p>
<p>I have previously stated that the ancestor of the chuanqi drama should be Song Dynasty plays such as "Wang Huan" and "Wang Kui," rather than Shi Hui's "Worshiping the Moon Pavilion" from the Yuan Dynasty. Ling is likely more skilled in musical meter and rhythm, but lacks knowledge of the history of drama, so when discussing the history of drama, he often makes errors. The sanqu poems written by Chen Dasheng of Nanjing in the late Ming Dynasty were printed in two collections in Lu Qian's Yin Hong Xuan Series. However, the Nanguo Lyrics, Yongxi Musical Treasury, Wu Sao Anthology, and other books still contain quite a few sanqu poems not included in the two books, about thirty or forty suites. If these were collected, they would make a very large volume. Ren Na and Ling Jingqian had both done this work, but unfortunately, it was never published. Chucheng refers to Ling Chucheng. His "Bearded Guest" appears in the "Second Collection of Sheng Ming Zaju." His "Northern Red拂 (Fu)" has also recently been reprinted. This is a retelling of the Tale of the Bearded Guest with a different protagonist. He uses three people to sing in "The Three Heroes of Fengchen," writing each of them as the main character, and the third book has yet to be found. He dedicated himself to popular literature. The "First and Second Slaps to Amazement" were edited by him. The "Pipa Ji" of the so-called Yuan Dynasty edition (reprinted by Chan Yin Lu) was likely his adaptation under the guise of antiquity. From this book, it can be seen that he made great efforts to research the ancient Pipa Ji in the opera scores. In the postscript to Pipa Ji, we know that he had also written a chuanqi based on the Yuan Dynasty's "舍汁衫 (shed blood shirt)".</p>
<p>Yan Zhou's jade flute conveys the sound of a phoenix,</p>
<p>Shaobai's black silk describes Washing Silk.</p>
<p>Seeking truth in events and beauty in writing,</p>
<p>Mistakenly taking cut paper flowers as spring blossoms.</p>
<p>Ling has repeatedly stated that drama does not necessarily have to conform to history, and now he reiterates this point. In this poem, he advocates for naturalness and opposes piling up and embellishment, which I strongly agree with. He says: Wang Shizhen (Yan) wrote the Chuanqi drama "The Story of the Ming Phoenix," seeking truth in everything; Liang Chenyu (Shaobai) wrote the Chuanqi drama "Washing Silk," seeking beauty in every sentence. Both of these attitudes are wrong. As a result, seeking truth does not necessarily lead to truth, and seeking beauty does not necessarily lead to beauty. On the contrary, the fake seems real, and the vulgar seems beautiful. The pursuit of truth and beauty results in lifeless paper cut flowers, not as good as the flowers of nature in spring, which cover the mountains and fields. They are unadorned, yet they have natural charm.</p>
<p>After Sisyphus, ancient tones went astray,</p>
<p>One after another, the soul returned and the hairpin was recovered.</p>
<p>Since Qingteng established a separate school,</p>
<p>Who else in the Music Bureau can continue the legacy of Cheng Xiao?</p>
<p>Xu Wei, the master of the Qingteng Study, his "Sisyphus" (四聲猿), according to Ling, has a divergent tonal system. Tang Xianzu's "Peony Pavilion" and "Purple Hairpin", causing the voices of all the people under the sky to twist, is indeed a fact. But Zhu Youdun's earlier "Cheng Xiao's Music Bureau" could not follow the Yuan Dynasty's musical rhythm, breaking the rules of one character singing in one act and four acts per book.</p>
<p>In front of the Jade Tea Hall, dusk after dawn,</p>
<p>Gourd-imitation is feared from depicting past people.</p>
<p>The foolish child does not recognize the邯鄲步,</p>
<p>Bitterly learning Wang Wei's banana in the snow.</p>
<p>Tang Xianzu, the master of Jade Teahouse, said: "My meaning is to let others copy the melody even if I break the melody." This means that I would rather the melody conform to my meaning than my meaning conform to the melody. It can be seen that Tang Xianzu was unwilling to draw gourds as they were, but to create his own situation. The general public does not understand and instead learns the 邯鄲步, then it is really like Tang said in his sarcastic poem: "Even if you cut and divide modern times, you will still be ashamed of Wang Wei's old snow scene."</p>
<p>Teeth, sounds, and vocal chords all vie for beauty,</p>
<p>From the brilliance of flowers, the Lesser Vehicle meditation unfolds.</p>
<p>In the cauldron, there is a divine elixir,</p>
<p>But merely refraining from swallowing the knife is not yet immortality.</p>
<p>This poem contains quite a bit of disparagement towards Wu Bing, the author of "Five Kinds of Glory." It says that he still cannot concoct the divine elixir, but can only swallow and breathe fire; he can only participate in shallow Lesser Vehicle meditation, not enough to discuss profound Great Vehicle meditation. The meaning seems to say that Wu Bing's heavy use of red and green is too excessive, only focusing on weaving dense patterns, resulting in a "tothful" wife (句齿) of the lecherous Dengtuzi, and Dongshi imitating, failing. Wu Bing specifically studies Tang Xianzu, and this song is probably secretly scolding Wu Bing, right?</p>

<h3>Feeling Upon Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xu Junwu</p>
<p>The whirlwind chariot sends me off from the ten mile marker outside of Jiang, as if recovering a pearl carrying dust with me. The mood of the past follows dreams; a freezing, towering, maritime air surrounds the lights in the cold. To call out for the magpie, is there no regret? To seek skin from a tiger, I only feel apprehensive. Lingering on the tower, I smile bitterly at my loneliness, who will lend a branch for Du Ling's rest!</p>
<p>Writing Spring Bottom Autumn</p>
<h3>A Shortened Expression</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Many people scold "officialese," but I have a different interpretation of it.</p>
<p>Literally, "officialese" should refer to the format of official documents. Although some people have a headache with phrases like "due to the aforementioned" and "upon receipt of this," a closer examination of its structure reveals that it is thoroughly and logically organized. If it encounters a case with verifiable records, if the person handling the case carefully examines the records, then the division of responsibilities can be immediately seen. Precisely for this reason, Qing Dynasty officials employed "secretaries." The brilliance of the "secretary" lies entirely in the skill of being able to reduce or shed his master's responsibility. Therefore, "officialese" should be a source of headaches for officials.</p>
<p>Here is an example: "Repeated orders and five declarations" are precisely a political weakness. If officials feel a headache about the exposure of weaknesses, then it is best not to leave traces of "repeated orders and five declarations." However, for example, when the Chairman's edicts are issued one after another, the official documents of the executing agencies transferring orders to subordinates must say "Repeatedly received the Chairman's 手諭 (handwritten edict)." Each  here represents a handwritten edict of one day. Three  mean three orders, and five  mean five declarations. This is because of the "officialese" that the traces of "repeated orders and five declarations" had to be left behind, which should be a headache for the officials.</p>
<p>However, "officialese" is what the common people have a headache about. Why is this? There is a common saying: "Officialese is just talk." It turns out that the "officialese" that the common people have a headache about is a shortened expression, referring to the four words that have been shortened at the end— "just talk."</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing and Such</h3>
<p>— Wang Tiran</p>
<p>As the weather turns cold, the northwest winds rise, and the "filthy sentences" that "red doors smell of wine and meat" and "frozen corpses line the streets" cannot help but float to the minds of scholars. And when the weather turns cold, every night some poor people and bums freeze to death on the streets, which is indeed a very old and陈腐 matter. Regarding these types of things, most people generally disdain to give them a glance. Even if they occasionally see them on the road, they always urgently cover their noses and go on. This cannot be blamed on people's heartlessness, perhaps because death is ultimately ugly and cannot arouse the attention or interest of the living, right?</p>
<p>However, even if this is the case, death is ultimately the end of life. If one can live, how can one die? Since death occurs, there must be a reason why life is difficult. Thinking like this, one can know that life is originally ugly as well. Perhaps even uglier than death. In order to survive, in order to live, how many people are servile, shameless, willing to sell their souls, willing to stain their bodies, to maintain their ugly lives. They have survived, but is their life not even uglier than death? Comparing it in this way, those who are turned over in ditches and finally die on the cold roads, although they are pitiful "weaklings," are worth pitying.</p>
<p>Especially when we think that after victory, many people have achieved "five sons succeeding in the imperial examinations" (a sign of great success), but many people have "nothing left in life," even being stuck and dying, we ultimately feel that it is too unbearable. Who has failed them? Why is no one saving them? Indeed, there are too many people waiting to be saved now, and philanthropists cannot save everyone. But the fact is that relief work this year has not been done well from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason is that we see news about the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the newspaper every day, so everyone feels that there are already enough people to save the poor. In fact, the gentlemen in the "Kind Salvation" bureau are also feeling very troubled with the task of relief. There are many examples, such as flour. Although the Western flour is white and good, the common people are buying very little of it. Clothes are also a big problem. The UNRRA has tens of thousands of sets of Western suits, originally prepared to be distributed to poor people, but it is said that they are not suitable for Chinese poor people to wear, because Chinese poor people should only wear cotton-padded jackets. And as a certain newspaper reporter said with flourish, giving these Western suits to refugees makes them "Western-dressed bums," which is even more humorous but also makes people feel a mix of laughter and tears. Such things show that saving the poor is really difficult. And both being a philanthropist and a charitable official are difficult, that is self-evident.</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way, the most troublesome thing in the world is known to be all in China, and winter clothing is just one example. We, being one of the Chinese people, have no other way except to feel ashamed and to pity ourselves.</p>
<h3>A Double Flight of Love (8) (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Heavens! Last night I dreamed of a yellow oriole-like bird, flying out of my arms calling, and now this sound is the sound of that bird calling!"</p>
<p>Master Mo felt a sense of dread! He thought: Could it be that I'm dreaming again? He looked up at the window, the red sun was in the sky. His heart was filled with doubts, and in a state of panic, Mo Sheng rushed in again.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Master! The Madam has given birth to a baby girl!" Mo Sheng said, smiling and standing to the side.</p>
<p>"Ah?" Master Mo seemed not to have heard clearly.</p>
<p>"Papa! Mom really gave me a little sister:" Bao Ling jumped up with joy. She grabbed Mo Sheng and clamored, "Mo Sheng, take me to see my little sister, I told Papa earlier: I want a little sister."</p>
<p>Mo Sheng did not say anything, and quietly pouted at Master Mo. Bao Ling understood what he meant and stopped talking.</p>
<p>Master Mo fell into deep thought again. Now that he knew the sound just now was the cry of a newborn baby, he quickly realized that last night's dream was a harbinger of this event. And so, he felt even stranger! He wanted to tell Bao Ling about this strange dream, but Bao Ling was too young to understand. Tell Mo Sheng, Mo Sheng is just a servant after all, he was afraid of hurting his dignity by telling him these idle words. In the end, he thought of Master Weng, and as if he had found salvation, he immediately instructed Mo Sheng:</p>
<p>"Mo Sheng, go and see if Master Weng is awake? Please invite him to come to our place when he's had his fill of opium, and tell him I have something to discuss with him. And while you're at it, ask him to bring a bottle of their family's good wine."</p>
<p>"Master, you can't drink any more wine! Your cough..."</p>
<p>Before Mo Sheng could finish speaking, Master Mo waved his hand and said:</p>
<p>"You don't understand! You don't understand! Go quickly!"</p>
<p>Mo Sheng had no choice but to agree and leave.</p>
<p>Seeing that Master Mo had returned to normal, Bao Ling seized the opportunity to beg him:</p>
<p>"Papa: I want to go see my little sister."</p>
<p>Master Mo nodded. But just as Bao Ling was about to leave, he remembered that Bao Ling's homework was not yet finished, so he stopped her, saying:</p>
<p>"You haven't recited your books yet!"</p>
<p>"Then, I'll recite them and then go."</p>
<p>Bao Ling quickly returned to her desk. Master Mo looked at Bao Ling and it didn't seem like she hadn't memorized the books. So he said:</p>
<p>"Alright! As long as you have memorized them well, just recite them tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Bao Ling was overjoyed, so happy that her little heart blossomed, and she immediately ran outside. Before leaving, she turned back and asked Master Mo.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to see my little sister, Papa!"</p>
<p>This reminded Master Mo. He thought to himself that's right, now that the child is born, he should go and comfort his wife, otherwise, he would be criticized and blamed by his wife for being "heartless and unrighteous" in the future. Thinking of this, he followed her out of the study.</p>

<h3>Raising Educational Loan Funds: Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale Opens Today: Ancient and Modern Masterpieces...A Feast for the Eyes: Purchasing Paintings Helps Education...A Win-Win Situation</h3>
<p>The Ancient and Modern Painting Charity Sale Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Educational Loan Fund Committee will open at the China Painting Academy on Chengdu Road at 9:00 this morning. It will last for five days and close on the 27th. It is also stipulated that the 26th and 27th will be public lottery days. At that time, anyone who has purchased a charity sale calligraphy and painting ticket (5,000 yuan per ticket) will draw a number and collect the item corresponding to the number. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the association held a preview to entertain the press. More than 400 recent works by famous Shanghai calligraphers and painters were displayed in the exhibition, covering figures, landscapes, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes. At the same time, there are also two items for charity and auction, allowing people to choose and buy, with the highest bidder winning. The proceeds from the auction, after deducting half for the painter, will also be donated to the loan fund. In the last room of the Painting Academy, more than 20 ancient paintings from past dynasties, passed down from a certain family, are displayed, all of which are masterpieces from the Tang Dynasty and later. They are rarely seen by outsiders. The Shanghai Education Association has invited connoisseurs to estimate the value, each painting is uniformly priced at 100,000 yuan. The fairness of the price is extraordinary. A certain family will donate 40% of the proceeds from the sale of paintings to the educational loan fund. Their enthusiasm for helping education is admirable! In addition, Mayor Qian personally wrote more than ten works of seal script to support the charity event. The strokes are vigorous and outstanding, and the works are extraordinarily valuable. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will visit and purchase paintings to help education. The (blanks) are all for the same purpose. (blank) for sale. (blank) from (blank).</p>

<h3>Four Sisters Enthusiastically Help Education, Broadcasting Three Fundraising Events</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Educational Loan Fund Committee began handling educational loan fund work via the Shen Xin News newspaper line, the four sisters (blanks), Zhang Fan, Chen Juanjuan, and Chen Qi, responded to the call for fundraising for educational loan funds. They all agreed to broadcast and solicit donations. The broadcasting will be for three days, with the first day being the 24th, on the Universal Radio Station (1180KC), the 25th on the Xinsheng Radio Station (1080KC), and the 26th on the National Radio Station (1000KC). The time is from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM each day. At that time, the four sisters will take turns singing famous songs, and donors are welcome to request songs at will. The more the donations, the better. Given the popularity of the four sisters, the amount raised through broadcasting within three days will be considerable. Without deducting any expenses, every bit will be used for the educational loan fund. The four sisters' enthusiasm for helping education is particularly commendable.</p>
