<p>〔本報南京一日電〕全國商聯會於一日下午三時半，樂行首次大會，王曉籟主席，報吿籌備經過後，進行討論，決議：（一）電蔣主席致敬；（二）電呈蔣主席擁護八項主張，如期召開國大，實施憲政；（三）通過貴州代表建議，定十一月一日爲商人節。繼由各地代表分別報吿各該地商聯會情形，與工商近况，最先報吿者爲滬市代表駱淸華，謂：滬地工商情形與全國其他地點相似，同處於嚴重危機中，且日近崩潰，其所受壓迫，主要者有三：（一）高利貸，由於政府採取通貨膨脹，金融緊縮，致正當商業咸不能獲得貸款，乃不得不於黑市中吃一角八或二角之高利，工業爲之窒息；（二）高工資：滬市生活指教計算已達四千八百倍至五千借，工人底薪又增加，因之工人薪水絞前增加在二萬倍以上，生產成本隨之提高，工潮亦因而不斷發生；（三）外貨來我國頃銷，滬首當其衝，商業日見衰落。由於上述三種原因，工商危機日重，本年七月間，市商會等團體，曾組請願團來京，上月市參議會又組請願團，向中樞請願，前者已得政府批示，然未觸及眞正病源，亦未針對危機提出救濟辦法，此次滬代表曾有具體建議多種提出，盼能藉此盛會，得以解決。</p>
<p>浙代表朱惠清報吿，略謂：浙省因戰事影響，生產機構破壞殆盡，出產萎縮，絲綱產數不及戰前三分之一，茶不到半數，前途堪虞。</p>
<p>西康代表孫江堅報吿，謂：西康地面誠貧瘠，然地下蘊藏實富，盼能注意西南，開發蘊藏。</p>
<p>津代表劉錫三報吿，天津因海河問題，年需疏濬費甚鉅，且妨礙運輸，不便孰甚，盼塘沽新港能早日建成，此不特天津一地之福，實亦整個華北之利。</p>
<p>墨西哥代表致詞，盼能發展海外商業，並建議組織一遠航南北美之航業公司，載我國絲茶等特產，換外國金銀鈔票回國。墨地僑胞最苦者爲在海外發財後無法回國，希望能重視此點，並強調海內外同胞携手之重要。發言激昂，博得掌聲不少。</p>
<p>蘇代表陸小波報吿人民方面經入戰抗戰，誠可謂百孔千瘡，其後又有二百比一之幣值變更，人民更體無完膚，而接收工作又未能滿意，物資或爛或壞，几有不知去向者，言之痛心，蘇北所受戰禍更令人無從說起，工商方面基礎脆弱之輕工業，因齊金缺乏，外貨傾銷，已陷崩潰，商業方面因受重重稅收，亦苦不堪言。</p>
<p>其他閩，晉，川，皖，平等地代表亦均有簡短報吿。下午六時許散會，二日晨二次大會，將繼續聽取報吿。</p>
<h3>宋院長致訓詞　不僅作方策之決定　尤須有行動之表現</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕宋院長在商聯會致訓詞，全文如次：中華民國商會聯合會舉行成立大會於首都，子文以公務覊身，未克躬與盛會，深以爲憾，茲委托經濟部王部長，代致賀忱，並略陳微意如次；勝利以來，各地交通阻滯，生產萎縮，稅收困難，預算失平，物資匱乏，物價飛騰，以致工潮踵起，社會不安，演成困頓危難之現象。行政院參綜庶政，責無旁貸，經就恢復交通運輸，增加物資生產，整頓各種稅收，利用敵偽產業，開放國外貿易，調整對外匯率，調處勞資斜紛，各方面督導主管部會，分別規劃實施，以期治標及本，執簡馭繁，漸收安定物價，改善民生之效。顧今日經濟危機之消除，緯緒萬千，必須全面籌劃，上述各項，僅屬應急之措置，尙非根本之設施。商聯會與會諸君，均係各地工商領袖，對工商界當前疾苦，觀感自甚深切，如能利用此寳貴時機，各以明敏之觀察，共州作嚴密之硏討，以期產生具體方案，提供施政南針，則政府自必竭盡能力，以副諸君股切之期望。抑有進者，經濟問題，息息相關，政府人民，實不可分，民窮當然財盡，富國必先裕民，今日難關之渡過，固有待於政府之努力。尤須工商人士自覺自治，同德　心，勉忍艱苦，通力合作，方克有濟。商聯會爲全國工商界最高之組織，今後如何領導同業，協助政府，推行經濟法令，促進工商建設，實爲最嚴重之課題。所望與會諸君，同體時難，共矢貞恒，不僅作方策之決定，允須有行動之表現，以克服當前之危機，爭取今後之發展，並進而措國家於磐石之安，躋人民於一康樂之境，則今日之會。實國家民族興衰榮枯之所繫，不禁企予望之矣。</p>
<h3>政府首長訓話　谷正綱以三事相勉　王雲五促注意三點</h3>
<p>〔本報一日南京電〕陳立夫在全國商聯會訓話。略謂；商聯會之成立，表示我國商人精神上之大團結，在商業史上實開一新紀元。抗戰勝利，建國開始，商人責任更重，盼能健全本身，並增加對內對外聯繫，藉以增進商人福利，且有助於國家。詞畢，宋院長代表王雲五致訓，（詞見前）</p>
<p>繼由谷正綱致詞。以三事勉各代表：（一）要以健全的工商組織，求工商業之健全發展，大會應鄭重遴選理監事，注意人潠與地區分配，並加强海內外聯繫，以挽救經濟危機；（二）工商業要求，與政府之經濟政策應互相適應，檢討工商利益時，應注意整個國家利益；（三）要解決問題，不應僅解決提案。</p>
<p>王雲五致詞，略謂：在此組織經濟時代，商聯會之重要性，自不待言，盼能高瞻遠矚，依據法令，顧到國家利益，謀經濟之復興，並促能注意下列各點：（一）商聯目的在貨物流通，國際市塲之爭取，實極重要，復員以來，入超嚴重，鼓勵輸出，爲政府一貫政策，然所賴於工商業努力者亦多；關於對外匯率之調整，出口關稅之免除，出口事業之貼補政策，已次第實行，盼工商業亦能自作努力，挽救危機。（二）希望對技術管理學識精益求精，以完成工業建設。（三）加强本身組織，此舉不但可增加本身利益，對國家經濟當亦有益。</p>
<p>僑委會委長陳樹人致詞，略謂：僑民對發展對外貿易，厥功甚鉅，希望僑民能多多回國投資，多作考察，藉與國內工商界多取聯繫，同時希望國內同胞亦能多赴海外觀光。</p>

<p>茲錄蔣主席訓語原文如下：「我國農民佔全人口百分之八十，而農業生產及農村經濟，迄今尙停滯於中古時代之陳舊方式而鮮少改進，此不惟全體人民之生活因而困乏，即整個國家之建設亦由此而陷於萎頓，故今日建國事業，雖屬千頭萬緒，而提高農業生產，與充實農村經濟，俾能適應現代科學之步驟，實爲當前根本首要之圖。何以提高生產？則耕種機械化，斯爲光急；何以充實經濟。則農村工業化，尤爲要着，此皆本行今後最大之職責，亦即本行應將過去農村救濟之消極工作轉變爲農村建設積極工作之重大方針也。深盼此次行務會議全體同志，認淸目標，放大眼光，開闢業務之新徑。立有效之宏謨以完成劃時代之使命，而副中正創立本行之初衷，有厚望焉」。</p>

<h3>徵妙的中國大局</h3>
<p>中國的大局，今天眞已進入「微妙」的境界了！說它光明麽？眼前顯然還有陰影，不但有陰影，而且層層的雲霧也許正像要從山谷嵐岫中奔騰而出。說它黑暗麽？這三四個月來大霄雨的象微似乎已成過去，而最近半個月問雲霧更似已消散了許多，並且看了前天主席誕辰，萬民騰歡，普天同慶的氣象，大家總會體認得出直正民意之所向、與中國前途希望之所繫了；一派光明的遠景，又訛能閉了眼睛否認？中國的大局，目前就在這黑暗與光明的邊綠，也許正如漫漫長夜後的黎明。</p>
<p>我們且再回溯這一個月來的大局演變，眞可說奇峯突起，波瀾壯關的了。自中共儿月三十日聲明要求張家口停戰，否則認爲和談破裂，時局幾已到了斷港。馬司兩使張家口停戰十天的建議，雖經政府同意，而中共堅決拒絕，時局更迫近了絕　。幸而主席的國慶廣播，表示政府始終期望問誠商談，和談之門依然大開。迨十一日國軍收復張家口，政府下令國民大會決於十一月十二日如期召開，時局好似有暴雨要來；但經各黨各派及社會賢達的人士，奔走　旋於其　，十六日，主席更發表文吿，提示處理時局八項方計，於是進而有二十一日中共代表與其他各黨派代表的進京。戾氣漸消，祥和可致，大局到此，實在應該　迥路轉，柳暗花明的了。可是十天的時間，不能說過短，而首都空氣只是盤桓於非正式各別洽談之中，甚且無聊到先來討論宣傳休戰，不觸及具體的大問題，以致虛耗時日，連政府與中共代表大家一起坐在會談席上攤出最後一張牌的機會都不曾造成，豈不可惜？到昨天爲止的消息，政府又有極大讓步，只盼望各黨派開出國大代表的名單，政府就下令停戰，對主席十六日文吿中其他各點，縱在國大召開以後，儘可進行討論，政府且願繼續作政軍的讓步。我們以爲各方總應滿意了，大局也可以急轉直下，頓現光明了；詎知中共發言人又表示着堅決拒絕，而自稱「第三方面」的調人，也有一部分先後離京，雖否認外傳退出調停之說，且有各方面合組非正式綜合座談的建議，但究不能不認爲中國大局還停滯於「拖」的階段。然而國大召集之期，距今祇餘十天，政府選政於民，亦未許再失大信於人民，拖，其實也不能再拖了！我們就這千迥　折的中國局勢來看，「談」吧，在目前固未必水到渠成，但「打」吧，在將來也不一定就可速戰速決，而中國的大局，確已進入於不能不急求解決的地步。這就是中國大局「微妙」之所在！</p>
<p>解決此微妙的大局，我們始終以爲政府應站在主動的地位，對國家對人民負起責任來，——不但負目前的責任，而且負起歷史上的責任。政府應使人民起碼能够安居樂業，因之政府必須負責使國家眞正統一，使國家永久和平。政府此時能達成此任務，後世的史家自會給以公正的判斷。山共如不瞭解歷史所賦與此時中國政府的責任，而企圖阻撓國家的眞正統一與永久和平，人民也自然會給以公正的判斷。須知中國是中國人民的，而不僅僅是某黨某派乃至各然各派的。此時務請政府不要祇知道自己是第一方面，中共是第二方面，某黨某派是第三方面或第四方面第五方面，必須放大眼光看到全國的人民，任何方面不許以「方面」自豪而應該服從人民的公意。我們認爲：政府那一天能够認淸人民的意向，尊重人民的力量，就是那一天中國大局能由微妙而進於光明。</p>
<p>中共之無誠意於和談，不自今日始；政府固不能因爲中共之無誠意而關閉和談之門，但究也不能長此與木無誠意之徒墮入高談的深淵！我們願爲政府指明的是：中共固無意於和，而其他各黨各派的代表，無黨無派的賢達，乃至全國的人民則希望其和，實與政府同其殷切。政府應把握這一點，此時自動的作若干重大表示，使各黨各派無黨無派者，以及全國的人民，乃至天下後世，都能相信政府如此，確有和平統一的誠意，則政府就能對得起國家和人民了。中共今日僵持之所藉口者，一爲停戰，一爲政協約決議而已。試爲政府借將籌之；政府似可一面堂皇下令，自動宣吿就地停戰，只須共軍不再騷擾襲擊，決不用兵動武，一切留待商談解決；一而公布國大名單，並改組國府委員會，而此兩者均照政協商決，各方參加人數之比例，預留名額，以待中共與其他黨派代表之產生，只須一旦推出代表，立即可由國府公布，使他們大家得以參加國大與國府委員會。這兩種舉措，同時進行，前者可以表示政府蔪求和平之誠意，後者所以表示政府始終等待各方共同參加國大與政府而達成國家統一之願望。我們以爲，政府果真如此真誠實幹，不但可見諒於各黨各派的代表，無黨無派的賢達，乃至全國的人民，即在中共方面縱欲固執其一黨的偏見，亦將失去中國人民與世界友邦的同情。若政府如此忍讓，而中共仍拒絕參加國大，或甚至阻撓其他當派參加國大，則中共亦終於自暴自棄而已。</p>
<p>微妙的中國大局，如何撥開雲霧而見光明，就看政府怎麽樣來負起它所應負的責任了。</p>

<h3>天津破獲販毒案　主犯爲敵產處理局職員</h3>
<p>〔本報天津訊〕津市警察局於十月二十四日又破獲一販賣毒品案，共查獲烟土四十三斤零四兩，貸款兩千三百八十萬元，案內主角竟有現任公務員二人，一爲天津市政府秘書兼河北平津區敵僞產業處理局專員李家褫，一爲敵產處鉀局科員毛醒，有關人犯均經警局捕獲，茲將祥情誌次：</p>
<p>二十四日爲警察第十分局交通整理日，下午四時許，該局於管界黃家花園福順里附近整理交通時，値勤警士發現有三輪車一輛，急馳而行，違犯交通規則，乃阻攔盤詰，詎車上乘客竟神色大變，驚慌失措，警土見其行跡可疑，遂立加搜査，果於其所携皮包中携出鴉片烟四大包，該乘客於行藏敗露後，竟以一千萬元向檢査警士行賄，企圖逃出法網，當經警士嚴詞斥拒，帶分局審訊。</p>
<p>據該犯供稱：名劉金才，該項烟士係輕友人張麻子，徐阿毛二人介紹，以每兩六萬元價格，由李家褫宅中購得，擬即運往上海出售，已於李公館交有振興長銀號一千萬元支票一張，郵匯局一千萬元匯票一張。警局根據劉供，當日即將有關人犯現任敵產處理局專員之李家襯，科員毛醒，烟主孫周氏，李之僕人蕭長右，司賬方劬成，介紹人張益興一一先後捕獲，並在李家褫宅中搜出烟土八斤半，現款二百餘萬元，在孫周氏家中搜出烟具等物多件，張麻子徐阿毛二人則逃逸無踪。</p>
<p>經向各犯偵訊結果，得悉該項毒品全係孫周氏所有，由孫周氏內姪託毛醒出售，毛以之轉托李家褫，李乃囑其僕人蕭畏右司賬方劬成設法，蕭方又託成衣匠張益興，始由張麻子徐阿毛輾轉介紹與劉金才，據孫周氏供稱：此批烟土係其先夫遺產，託人出售，擬爲生活費用，並非專營此業云。</p>
<p>警局除己將烟土及貨款共二千三百八十萬元封存外，並正緝捕在逃人犯，全案即將移法院審辦。</p>

<p>郵局寄件謹防扒手</p>
<p>禮拜一午後，四川路郵局裏特別繁忙，尤其是寄大宗報紙的地方更是擁擠得水洩不通，摩肩接踵諸色人等俱全，於是一般扒手就混跡其間，撈混水魚了。不知不覺中我那一枝相依爲命的鋼筆，竟不翼而飛了。除了忠吿寄件朋友留心外，更希望郵政當局，能有一個盡善盡美的方法，來避免宵小的活動，且予以痛懲！（讀者世善上）</p>
<p>未到期存款將如何</p>
<p>關於戰前存款一千倍還本，法院的公平判決，當然對於一般無力上訴的戰前小存戶是無限感激的。可是這是單純指到期存款的賠償損失，而尙未到期須遲至數年後才到期的存款，恐怕在這物價日漲夜大之情形下，到將來到期時，亦沒有什麼貼補損失吧？所以在這正於考慮還本的時候，希財政司法當局加以注意！如能提前一併發還或有其他改善保障辦法時，則安分良民同叨大惠了。（蔣四德）</p>
<p>月台灣票價漲得太高</p>

<h3>聯大全會階段結束　各委員會分別開始工作　議程五十五項討論需時四五星期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山一日廣播：自今日起，聯合國機構將自全體大會階段，進入各委員會分別工作階段。目前準備討論之各項建議，計有推翻西班牙弗朗哥政權·管制原子能武器·普遍軍縮。以及託管制度之實施。在今後四五星期中，各委會將辯論各項重要問題，然後再向全體大會提出報吿。開會地點已自弗魯辛移至成功糊，各項設施甚爲完備，十六個委員會同時開會。今日舉行會議者，計有社會人權文化委員曾，行政預算委員會，經濟財政委員會與託管委員會。大會議程現已增至五十五項。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山一日廣播：墨西哥·瓜地　拉及委內瑞拉三個拉丁美洲國家，今日舉行重要會議，一致認爲建議聯合國家與弗朗哥政權絕交一舉，現尙非其時。衆料弗朗哥問題，又將暫時擱置。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約卅一日專電〕聯大會指導委員會今晨一致同意，將以下三項議案列入大會議程，（一）蘇聯莫洛托夫所提裁軍，（二）對弗朗哥問題之聯合議案，（以上二案已提交政治安全小組委員會）（三）荷蘭所提關於婦女政治權利一案，此案已提交社會慈善及文化小組委員會。一三兩案未經如何討論，即獲通過，列入大會議程。然引起爭辯之西班牙問題案，在獲得一致意見前，曾經激烈辯論。按該案係由比捷荷挪及委內瑞拉代表團聯合提出者。目前大會中及弗朗哥運動，至爲强烈，預料安理會於四日開會時，必將西班牙問題，自其識程中取出，而使大會進行討論。</p>
<h3>我代表申明立場　維護正義援助被壓迫民族　完全贊同美所提各項建議</h3>

<p>〔路透社弗魯辛卅一日電〕美代表團專家正從事硏究解釋憲章之問題，此問題之起，由於印度申訴南非之歧視印人。憲章第二條第二款嗣文規定，聯合國機構無權干涉任何國家國內管轄範圍以內之事件；然憲章第一條第三款則曰，聯合國機構目的之一，爲不分界域，促進並鼓動對人權及基本自由之尊重。此兩項規定似有衝突之處，故美專家目前正在硏究對第二條「干涉」兩字應作如何解釋，並硏究任何國內之少數民族，如何可以將其疾苦，向聯合國機構提出。美國深知聯合國全體大會就此所作之決定，對於具有少數民族之各國，將有重大影響。</p>

<h3>日侵攻太平洋階段　昨在國際法庭開審　首席檢察官季楠作長篇論吿</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京一日電〕遠東國際法庭今日進入審理太平洋戰爭階段，由首席檢察官季楠作長篇論吿稱：一九三八年，日本宣言東亞新秩序，主張在中國之優先權，美國乃於一九三九年七月通吿廢棄日美通商。一九四一年七月，東條發起召開御前會議，決定日本不顧世界局勢，確立大東亞共榮圈，並揭</p>
<p>南進方策</p>
<p>在該會議中，松岡，白鳥諸人主張進占南方以前，或同時參加德國之對蘇作戰。七月廿六日，羅斯福總統下令凍結日本資產，日本與英美荷之通商，乃吿斷絕。八月廿八日，近衛向羅斯福總統提議舉行兩國首腦會議，並附聲明書謂：（一）日政府俟中日事變解決，東亞獨立後，自越南撤兵。（二）日政府聲明現在越南之行動，並非向鄰近各地採取軍事行動之預備手段。九旦三日總統提議舉行預備會談；六日，日大使要求美國停止其在遠東及西南太平洋之軍事措置。是日，東條及軍部後召開</p>
<p>御前會議</p>
<p>決定會談倘不能於十月中旬前獲得滿意結果，日本即應實行攻擊。東條上台後，大勢迅速趨向戰爭。十一月五日之御前會議決定於廿五日以後完成準備，同時開始戰鬥行爲。是日復發出聯合艦隊密令第一號，準備襲擊珍珠港，及準備聯合艦隊對英美荷作戰。二日後，發出密令第二號。十一月十日，命令日本所有船舶，於廿日前完成戰鬥準備，並令有力之日機動部隊，集合於千島羣島。同月廿六日晨，下令襲擊珍珠港。機動部隊於午後六時向東移動，繼向南進行·在此期間，</p>
<p>日美交涉</p>
<p>依然繼續進行，作爲　擊計劃之烟幕十三月一日，召開最後御前會議，出席東鄉，東條，島田，賀屋，鈴木，永野，星野，岡，武藤。對決定戰爭一事，無人表示反對。決定「X」日爲東京時間十二月八日，內閣曾討論通吿開戰形式，結果決定用文書通吿開戰·此物旣非宣戰布吿，亦非最後通牃，且襲擊珍珠港後一小時送達，此項文書之發出及送達時刻，應由東鄕負責。十二月六日，東鄕送長電與野村大使，囑於另獲訓令前勿予提出。七日，訓令將該電於華盛頓時間七日午後一時提出。六日晚，羅斯福總統親電日皇，</p>
<p>冀免悲劇</p>
<p>性事態，該電於東京時間七日正午抵達東京，然至午後十時半，始送交格魯大使，格氏於八日午前零時五分遞交東鄕，東鄉表示立即呈遞日皇，然於不足一小時之後，日侵略部隊已開始在英領馬來東北之新高打登陸。一方面在華盛頓，野村大使於該地時間七日午後一時請求晤見國務卿赫爾，然因事於四十分鐘後始行會見。斯時已在珍珠港被襲廿五分鐘之後，新高打之攻擊亦已展開。珍珠港之襲擊，由停泊該地北方二百廿海里處之日本航艦六艘放出三百六十架飛機實行。</p>
<p>偷襲珠港</p>
<p>效果甚大，美艦隊計被擊沉戰艦四艘，重損戰艦四艘，巡洋艦，驅逐艦各三艘。海軍官兵，自基特上將以下，死亡一千一百九十九人；陸戰部隊死亡百另九人；市民死亡五百四十六人；地上飛機喪失百八十八架，沿岸設備損失甚大。日方損失飛機八架，小型潛艇五艘，死傷者不足百人。一小時後，野村將上述通吿遞交赫爾。東京時間八日午前七時，日本電台首次廣播戰鬥開始。七時半，東鄉邀見格魯，謂午前三時會謁見日皇，同時將野村於華盛頓遞交赫爾之文書副本遞交格魯，謂此即日皇對羅斯福總統親電之答覆，此事顯屬虛僞。同日正午，日皇頒</p>
<p>開戰詔書</p>
<p>東條繼即發表聲明，謂此次攻擊乃自衛手段。日本國民從此一路被驅向戰爭之路，數十萬房屋及數百萬人之生命，爲饜足該被吿之野心，被戲於戰神之前。侵略東北，席捲華北，及併呑全中國，均爲此等被吿所研究，所計劃，所行動。被吿等之廣大戰略目標，實在於併吞全中國·菲律賓·荷印·澳洲。及紐西蘭。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕東京國際法庭檢舉日本各被吿將近結束，被吿方面即將開始辯護。辯護人方面計劃：審判將延長至明年六月中旬。辯護律師要求法庭舉行總辯論及分段辯論，以及各被告之最後分別辯護等。每一被吿及其證人如佔時一星期，則廿七被吿即需廿七星期。何時開始辯論，數日內即可決定。</p>

<h3>留美同學聚餐會　吳市長發表意見　應有忘我的精神</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中午十二時，留美同學會假座大東酒樓舉行聚餐會，吳市長被邀蒞席，發表其對於大學敎育之意見略謂：</p>
<p>敎育的目的是增進知識，大學的敎育，乃是敎一個人更像一個『人」，而更異於「禽歡」。</p>
<p>美前駐華大使赫爾利說：「蔣委員長是偉大的」。赫爾利是一個最沒有偏見的人，他爲什麽要佩服蔣主席，他說：「因爲他有「忘我的精神」。所以凡是人，都應該忘掉自己。多想人家，少想自己。</p>
<p>現在，住在上海的市民，免不了對上海有許多不滿意的地方，例如物價的高漲，社會的不安定等。所以整頓上海，最重要的設施，是抑低物價，但是要抑低物價非便利交通不可，要交通方便，便要停止內戰。在座都是留美的同學，相信會貢獻出很好的意見，本人必能虛心接受。</p>

<h3>國大閩代表　詹調元印象　金門飯店皤然一老　關懷國是跋涉長途</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕七十七歲的福建省國大代表詹調元氏，大前天從厦門乘飛機來上海，現在住在金門飯店三樓一間見代化的房間裏。也身穿藍布長掛，戴一頂小摘子瓜皮帽，門牙缺了兩頭，花白的　　不長不短地飄垂胸前，兩鬢亦已斑白。最使我感到興趣的是他手裏拿的那枝亮晶晶的水烟筒。這一種烟具在我們童年時代的鄕村生活裏，會經看到祖父輩的人物普遍地使用。如今在隔了十多年的今日，在這繁華都市的最摩登的旅館之一的三層樓上，我又重睹故物，而且面對着這一位祖父造的人物，儘管　外　約傳來南京路上車馬行人喧囂的鬧聲，我不禁沈緬於一種思古的幽情裏去了。</p>
<p>替記者介紹的另一位國大代表，民國十五年左右曾經當過陸軍四十九師旅長，現在是漳州參議會議長的楊逢年先生。他打破了我的默想，說：「這次最難得的是詹老先生，我們都勸他不要來了，但是他對國事非常熱心，堅持着一定要參加。」</p>
<p>的確，在這一位七十七歲老人的眼睛裏，還放射着熱情光芒。雖然他發會的音調已很低微短促，但是我可以相信他，祇少還保有着中年人的心淸。當我問他路途是否感到辛苦的候時，他說，飛機像汽車一樣平穩，而在到了上海，早晨還徒步去大新公司觀光了一次。</p>
<p>他　住水烟筒抽過幾口烟，站想來踱了幾步，很興奮的對我說：「本來像我這樣年紀的人，用不着再來跋涉遠途；但是這一次的國民大會對於國家太重要了。我們從民國二年袁世凱時候起，就閙着立憲，一直到現在三十幾年了，還沒有制定一部憲法！」</p>
<p>關於憲法，他是贊成五五憲草的。在這次國大裏，他說預備提出加緊實施地方自治的議案。「唯有民選的地方言，才不會有汚凟職的行爲。」這是他與楊先生　口同聲說出的共同信念。</p>
<p>談起數十年前的事，詹老先生更覺神采飛揚了。他說辛亥起義那年，他在福建策動了三府的光復，同志們提了銅觀滿街敲叫。『三十五年了！」他無限感慨地嘆息，最後忽然笑了起來，說：「我加入國民黨的時候，你還不知道在什麽地方呢」</p>
<p>辭別了這一位革命老前輩走出金門，我心頭湧起一種說不出的複雜的情緒，我想起苦難的中國老代表……這一切給予我們的感慨眞是太多了。</p>

<h3>中國公司新型客機　第一架定十日抵滬</h3>

<h3>保管或使用公地　年底前須辦登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午舉行之五十三次市政會議，通過有關土地登記二案。其一爲各機關保管或使用之公有土地，應由原保管機關或使用機關囑託地政局登記，本市各機關保管或使用之公有土地尙未登記者，應於本年十二月底前囑託地政局辦理，逾期未經囑託之公有土地　將由地政局依法予以接以。其一爲凡在黃浦·滬南·閘北·　涇·法華·引翔等六個土地總登記區域內，無條約規定及無國籍外人之土地權利，亦應於本年十二月三十一日以前，一律向地政局　請登記，以憑處理，逾期不爲聲請登記者，以無主之土地論。</p>
<h3>華商倉庫業　數家閉歇　營業困難　原因有二</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕堆積於本市各種倉庫中之敵偽物資，數月來經敵產處理局委託江海關處理結果，十之七八已吿出清，倉庫擁塞情形已大爲改善。惟衆商倉庫業之營業情形則已陷於不景氣之狀態中，十月份中已有數家閉歇。</p>
<p>華商倉庫營業困難之原因，除設備範圍方面難與外商頡頏外，同業方面亦競爭頗烈。其中銀錢業經營押放款所　設之倉庫，自成系統，迄未加入公會。此類倉庫因有利息收入貼補，故取費較普通倉庫低廉一倍，每月每立方公尺僅八十元普通倉庫則爲一百六十元。因此顧客自然趨向於前者，且可得押款之便利。而事實上據普通倉庫業中人稱：每立方公尺一百六十元之收費，在物價日漲之下，已有虧蝕之虞。另一現象則爲以前進存敵偽物資之倉庫，現雖吿出清，但一年來之損失已頗可觀。期內敵產處理局雖亦給予租費，但與市價相去甚遠，如六月份以前每立方公尺每月僅給十五元，六月份起亦僅增至二十五元。現物資出清以後，一時又難覓得主顧，因此停業者頗多。</p>

<h3>吳市長警吿油商　不得藉口減電以製造黑市　囤原料者將勒交他廠代製</h3>
<p>昨日下午二時半，吳市長在市府召集中國植物油料廠，中國食油公司，油餅食糧同業公會，油餅食糧零售商同業公會各代表，及社會局糧食科吉科長，舉行談話會，吳氏首對最近汕似波動原因，及其癥結所在諸點垂詢甚詳，繼由油餅食糧同業公會代表發言認油價上漲，係電力供應不足、影響產量所致，吳市長對此解說極表不滿，蓋本市各榨油廠，據事先精密調査，除巾植油廠需電較多外，其餘油廠，平時需要電力較小，供應上不成問題，故其產量不致因電力而减少，按油價彼動原因，不外（一）油商推波助瀾操縱市面，（二）油廠株守原料，故作觀望，是以吳市長復作警吿稱，對第一點，勸導油商不得捕風捉影，製造黑市，對第二點，如擁有原料，而不開工者，可交別家代製，否則均應嚴加取締，並定今日上午十一時，召見榨油廠同業公會理事曹莘耕，切實詢問，藉明眞相，最後吳氏對中植中食聯合配銷食油，認爲滿意，幷經當塲發表，爲加强中植生產計，該廠每週五停電，可予開放云。</p>
<h3>米市呆定油價猛跌</h3>
<p>米市客貨登記一萬六千餘石，消化轉懈，白粳呆滯，秈米亦少交易，中次略見修削，白元陰元供過於求，下跌二一千元，黄豆油廠納胃轉佳，東北黄豆各埠去化不動，依然平平，中原黄豆見升千元，豆餅汕頭進取，價漲三四百元，麩皮堅挺百元，油市以廠供見多，店胃反成看望，生油猛跌五六千元，豆油菜汕平平，淸油彷彿，蔴油不振，生仁外埠銷路停頓，價格下挫二三千元。</p>
<h3>金鈔徵鬆</h3>
<p>烚赤昨在央行管制下，稍呈平穩，晨開二三四萬八至二三五萬三，開後即吿少挫，逐漸回低，壓力頻仍，買氣被遏，十時後央行以二三二萬七五之價，配給六〇條，此後更無振作之力，近午更盤低至二三二萬三，而後吿定，午刻在二三三萬左右徘徊，午後尙形穩定，仍能回升至二三四萬以上　結果較前收回小八千，銀樓飾金紋銀均無變動，銀元則升至二千元光景，暗拆銀根平平，暗息在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣形勢稍鬆，美鈔暗市中初報四一八〇元賣，四一三〇元買，午刻微挫至四一二〇元及四一七〇元之間，最後更降至四一五〇元以下，結果較前收稍低，港票尙形平定，惟買意稍淡，結果無甚榮辱，港匯實銷有限，八九五元，印匯一〇九〇元，英匯一四三〇〇元左右，成交不多，美匯掛牌不動，並無對做。</p>
<p>公債續跌</p>
<p>公債昨在零散賣戶集中了結下，再吿不振，統丙晨開一八五〇元，自一八八〇元賣價起，買戶觀望，賣方揚威，逐漸下降至一七五〇元以下結束，結果較前收續跌一一〇元，甲乙平平，統丁微挫二十元，統戊則跌四十元。</p>
<h3>上月底銀根較舒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據金融界人士談：上月底金融界頭襯之調撥，已不若以前數月之緊俏。銀根情形之平穩，得未曾有。此緣在常局未實施公庫法前，各界對國營事業配售物資及稅務機關應納之款項等，常多壓積至每月月底解繳。而金融業於每月底時，亦例須結帳。在此雙重之壓力下，故每屆月底時，市而銀根常趨緊俏。茲以公家款項，均須集中解繳國庫，且均須隨時解繳，不得拖延積壓，故推測今後各月底結帳時，銀根方面當可減除壓力不少·</p>
<h3>香皂征貸物稅　商會電請免除</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會以査現行貨物稅條例第三條之第十三類，列入化妝品者，計十四項，香皂即爲十四項之一。然香皂僅爲洗身之用，與牙粉牙膏之洗商者，同一性質，並未含有美觀裝飾之意義在內，實與雪花膏唇膏香粉胭脂等項，全然有別。現在牙膏牙粉，立法院於訂立貨物稅條例之時，並未列入化妝品之內抽收貨稅，則香皂一項援例除外，實屬不無理由。特電呈立法院提議修改云。</p>

<h3>紗廠另有開出　紗價跌十餘萬　紡建配布紛紛貼價脫手　棉紡業公會主維持契約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，於昨日下午四時，在該公會會址，召開全體會員大會，到各會員代表卅餘家，由該公會理事長王啓宇氏主席。當對紡管會日前所提供之要案四點，分別討論。各代表對第一點，認爲於商業習慣上，對已成契約，復作多退少補之更動，似有未便。故決推請王啓宇氏與代表若干，於下週一向吳主委面陳困難。對第二三四各點，各代表均認爲可遵照施行。又對紡管會提供議價單之事，各代表認爲六區棉紡公會，旣設有議價委員會，在議價步驟方面，仍望能由議價會議定後，交紡管會核准，然後再由議價會通知各廠遵行。對增加南運紗布數量一案，各代表均表滿意·開吳主委對各廠南運紗布之申請手續，決使充份簡捷化，俾本市紗布能早日開始南運，以解救華南紗布之恐慌云。</p>
<p>又本埠各紗廠於上月廿六日配出棉紗一萬二千件，業田染織業等六公會配售實用各戶。現各客戶依照配紗預約單所規定之三日。至今日止，備足價款，分向紗廠掉換棧單，陸續出淸配紗。昨日各紗廠有開出棉紗，以助抑平市况。計有永安紗廠開出四百五十件，中紡紗廠開出八百廿八件，榮豐紗廠開出四百件，恒大紗廠九十件。聞申新紡織公司今日亦將有紗開出云。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗價格商綫下降，因聯配會此次配出棉紗，槪由直接生產之複製品工業公會轉配，加以墊本太重，市塲上爭先吐售，各支鈔綫，在落十五萬至廿五萬，益以永安等紗廠另有配售，是以買戶裏足，交易寥落，二十支雙駕跌進二百萬大關，四十二支下降至三百四十萬元，卅二支喊價二百二十萬元。</p>
<p>棉布價格，益　下游，市塲有吐無進，前日紡建開出之貨，竟有貼價競求脫手者，俏俐之一九〇號陰丹士林，亦隨之慘跌，雛鷄牌士林下降至十二萬元，大陸士林祇售十一萬八千元，染料價格雖未見低落，但色布却一蹶不振，各染廠因銷數不旺，坏布進胃亦呆，龍頭細布八萬三千，中檔玉龍細布跌至七萬元，常州低檔貨則僅喊六萬元尙無人問津。</p>
<h3>空方聲勢激浩大　華股節節下挫</h3>
<p>華股昨空方示威·在紗布結款限期繳納之訊傳佈下，買戶畏縮不前，晨開經賣意迫切下，永紗六九〇元勉强成交，即吿爭賣，信和即下降甚多，開後一片爭售之聲，各股急切下挫，並無多大維持，供方屈伏於空方聲勢之下，疲莫能興，近下隔夜浮多若一六四號等紛紛了結，永紗跌至六六〇元關邊，美亞竟破三〇〇〇元大關，但此時一七六號，二三二號等，逢低再進，八九號等亦有補空，低後屢有波折，無如大勢不利，終呈易跌難升之象，午後結果熱股計永紗美亞信和景福各跌半成光景，新光跌百分之四，勤興則跌百分之六，冷股中麗安平平外，餘均微跌，午後上塲小穩，不久逢高有售，檯面帮以及散空幾一致向放空活動，逐漸回跌至晨午低價，始稍盤旋，結果較前收熟股計永紗新光勤興各跌百分之四，美亞信和景福跌半成，冷股中紡中絲新亞麗安華豐平平，餘均微跌至挫半成不等，塲外各股平多跌少。</p>
<p>外股上場續進，惟高後仍難持久，逢高有證券幫脫手而稍轉低，結果較前收計怡紗英聯紙業亞洲鋼業各吿徵挫，怡啤會德豐跌半成左右，業廣平平。</p>
<h3>計口授糖　本月七日開始　每人每月一斤</h3>
<p>市府爲取締食糖黑市，特舉辦計口授糖，當由社會局與台糖公司，擬定辦法，訂本月開始實施。頃悉：市民購糖證，已由民政處交各區保甲轉發市民，本月七日即可由全市南貨店同時發售，本市市民，經民政處調査，爲三百六十萬，購糖蹬已發出三百六十萬張，規定每人每月購糖一斤，共爲三百六十萬斤，總計配售兩萬包（每包一百八十市斤），台糖公司已準備妥當，本月四日，各南貸店即繳款提貨，七日發售，價格方面經食糖審議會決定，台糖公司每斤以八百元售與南貨店，南貨店以一千元一斤售與市民，南貸店每斤有二百元之利潤，如保甲有捎握不發，南貨店有抬價情事，市民均可檢舉。各南貨店售糖後，即將市民購糖　彙繳台糖公司結賬，如有剩餘，台糖公司得照原價收回食糖，如南貸店不願退貨，則以每斤一千三百元之限價，補付五百元與台糖公司。</p>
<h3>美棉回漲</h3>

<h3>一個奮鬥出來的啞學生　祖振綱赴美深造　出國在即吿別聾啞同胞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕啞學生祖振綱，因限於生理缺陷，未能在國內升學深造，深自憤恨，幾經奮鬥，以謀自立，始得任中國聾啞協會常務理事，並供職於社會部統計處·最近美國紐約聾啞學校來電特許，准其入學深造，我敎育部亦撥美金一千元，以補助其學費。聞祖振綱即準備出國，日昨並發表「吿別聾啞同胞書」，原文如下：「親愛的聾啞同胞們：我現在是以聾啞同胞與中國聾啞協會常務理事的立塲來說話。我很懇誠地希望我們切實明瞭國內聾啞同胞生活和事業上的痛苦，所以我們四百餘萬的聾啞同胞必須互相諒解，互相敬愛，共同負責努力，爲聾啞大衆來謀幸福，以期容易求得一般社曾賢明人士的同情重視，使我們得與一般人平等享受自由權利，這實在是我們一致的呼籲和要求。</p>
<p>不准入學</p>
<p>國內聾啞同胞求學就業各問題，都非常嚴重，婚姻方面，亦更感覺困難，因此造成了國家社會的損失。因爲我曾在抗戰期間要求敎育當局給我入學的機會，承陳立夫先生，雖然曾經准許貸金，並入國立藝術專科學校和國立第九中學肄業，但是各該校校長都沒有接受我這個學生·其理由是他們認爲聾啞人是不健全的·無法施敎。因此，我下了最大的決心，志願獻身從事聾啞福利事業，我的希望是我國聾啞求學和就業，都日有發展，而使我們將來必能獲得自由幸福的機會。</p>
<p>特許留學</p>
<p>我從民國三十一年入社會部統計處服務，到現在已有四年半了。今年一月，我獲得美國紐約聾啞學校特別允許，我作一個例外學生。後來美國華盛頓聾啞學院來信，也很歡迎我入學。馬歇爾元帥曾經援助我。加拿大駐華大使歐德倫將軍轉交我，那就是加拿大首相金氏親筆來信鼓勵我努力上進。特別是社會部谷正綱部長，很熱心同情地批准，由社會部派遣我以公費赴美留學，又承敎育部朱家驊部長，杭立武次長，熱心培植，由敎</p>
<p>前途光明</p>
<p>我曾經接到各國聾啞友人來信，知道荷蘭設立了幸福促進會，進行情况，十分發達，美國華盛頓，也有聾啞團體，已使美國聾啞人士，享受快樂幸福的生活。巴西京城里約熱內盧，有一個設備最完善的聾啞學校。敎學方法，很科學的，可使學生迅速進步。道可見各國聾啞求學和就業，都能突飛猛進，使我們感到無限的光明。</p>
<p>升學機會</p>
<p>抗戰期間，中國聲啞協會總會，設在重慶，是全國　啞同胞組織的重要中心，現在勝利了，本會不久即將遷移南京，因爲政府已經還都了·但是總會附設聾啞補習班，曾獲重慶各界熱心人士贊助捐款，該班正在籌備改組爲正式學校，使一般聾啞同胞，得有自由升學的機會·現在本會人才更感缺乏·所以本會最急需要聾啞優秀人才，以資加强工作，推廣事業，所以非常熱烈歡迎參加。如願參加者，請把自己的姓名，籍貫，家庭情况，年齡，住址，敎育程度，與二寸照片一張，一併寄到南京中山東路財政部秘書處廖智同志，或南京試院路考選委員會統計室彭錫庚同志査收，可是必定與廖彭兩位同志面談。</p>
<p>現在我準備出國，將來我回國之後，願意與您們見面，祝您們健康及幸福，再會吧！」</p>

<h3>蔣主席　蒞台外記</h3>
<p>— 十月廿六日台灣航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>元首蒞台，早在月初台灣致敬團返省時，便帶來了佳訊，可是誰都沒想到在廿一日翩然蒞止。</p>
<p>據宣傳委會夏主委透露，勵志社台灣分社從總社派了一個人，在京滬平昆記者團還逗留在草山·北投兩溫泉區時，長官便得悉了，但並未證實。一部份記者先搭機返滬的同時（十九日），電報來了，謂主席下午蒞台。省黨部正在召開黨務工作檢討會，二時許長官便的同李主委翼中，警備司令參謀長柯遠芬，靑年團主任李友邦，參義會議長黄朝琴等赴松山機塲，接着的是陳總務局長希曾和兪濟時局長等廿五人，他們一部份住草山，一部份留居勵志社。</p>
<p>二十一日下午三時三刻，美齡號載着主席伉儷在機塲着陸，主席對歡迎人員笑語着說，好好！夫人則在接受獻花以後，轉向葛秘書長談話，偉大的最高領袖在蒞臨台省第一步後，便搭汽車去行轅了！</p>
<p>元首行轅設在草山貫賓館，這裏是幽靜而氣候低於合北五度的溫泉區，山路是寬數的高級路面，而賓館則旣雅且靜，日本統治者過去作爲迎昭和太子的行宮，如今却給我們勝利的抗戰領袖駐節了！</p>
<p>二十二日十二時許，蔣夫人出現在最繁盛的合北市區—文武街，輕衣簡從，路人都趨前瞻仰。夫人御黑色大衣，特金邊黑皮夾，高跟鞋，態度從容。她在勵志社時，對該社的簡净，留有深刻的印象。</p>
<p>廿五日，是台省光復紀念日。去年今日，陳儀長官代表主席在中山堂接受日本投降者，今年今日，主席偕夫人，却親臨該堂受省胞的熱烈歡迎！</p>
<p>主席偕夫人，由陳長官曁夫人陪同至歡迎會塲，從三千多人的心底發出的掌聲，當主席在羣衆之前露面時，聲音像雷一樣的持久五分鐘，塲外，數萬人哄然的歡呼聲，從未間斷。</p>
<p>主席搭靈吉普車，在途中行選時，站立着和夾道歡迎的民衆　手答禮，一種偉大親切的感召，深印在每一個人的腦際。</p>
<p>會塲內，主席佇立在台前，他的偉大莊嚴的面影，羣衆們感動得流着熱淚：人們面對着最高領袖，追憶着他爲國族繼承總理遣志的努力，他那蒼白的髮鬚，已獲得了最高的偉人的榮譽。當他含笑揮手運聲說着「謝謝各位，謝謝各位同胞」時，那親切像每一個人的長者一樣，是的，他正是每一個國人的長者。他對羣衆們說，在台灣出席光復紀念大會，是平生最快慰的事，因爲五十一年來主席繼水總理所懷的恢復台灣的議志，是如願以償了。所以當黄議長朝琴致恭迎詞時，主席元首含笑點首！</p>
<p>同日上午十一時十分，主席偕夫人出現在台灣大學體育塲的首届全省運動會的司令台上，面對着主席的正是大幅的主席畫像，遙遠地隔着廣塲在數萬靑年面前顯現，敎部體育督學郝更生對記者說，主席蒞臨運動大會是第三次，每次都有無影，主席是很注重民族健康的！</p>
<p>下司令台，他扶着夫人下梯後，即赴台北市第一貴賓館休態了，這個貴賓館以前是日本總督官邸，何應欽將軍前蒞台時也曾駐留在此。</p>
<p>主席蒞台，不僅是台灣六百三十萬同胞的光榮，也正是全國同胞的光榮。合胞以最熱烈的情緒歡迎收復失地使台灣重返祖國的最高領袖·</p>

<h3>東北水利事業</h3>
<p>— 十月廿五日瀋陽航訊　本報特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>遍野的農產，發達的工礦業，造成了東北的富饒，但，人民有災難，摔着金碗討飯吃，關鍵在於河流時常汜濫爲害，水利事業，沒能充份利用和發揮，今年，僅遼河下游偏災，盤山一帶居民，估計損失，竟有東北流通券五十億元之多，迄今尙有餘水未退的地方，致令人民，居處水深火熱之中！</p>
<p>日人侵佔東北，建立僞滿政櫂，實行所謂的大陸政策，移民墾殖，極力經營，最初以松花江流域做爲殖民的中心，逐漸向南伸展，到達遼河流域，再漸漸擴展到了安東一帶，後來因爲民國廿二年和廿四年，松花江和遼河，先後洪水爲災，損失很大，纔知道了河道整治的關係重大。</p>
<p>同時爲了農業的增產和重工業的開發等，又莫不和水利息息相關，遂決心廣設水利機構，一面從事於各河道的勘査測量，以及水文的觀測，並且釐定防洪。灌漑·航運·水電和運河開挖等建設治理計劃，並着手施工，截至八·一五日人投降的時候，上項工作，從未間斷，看到她們所辦工程之大，計劃範圍之廣，已付人力財力之多，推行之速和收效之宏，在在邋人重視！</p>
<p>水昨設計經營</p>
<p>敵偽從民國二十二年，重視水利建設以後，就制訂「全東北河川治本計劃」，爲了計劃的實施和完成，曾先後設有「理水調查處」「防水土地開發事業局」「農地開發事業局」『滿洲拓植公社」「水利組合中央會」，此外還有彰武。錦州。營口。牡丹江·依臨·吉林·嫩江·呼倫·黑河·東寗·琿春等十一個工程處，辦規全東北各河的防洪·灌漑·排水·水電·堤防整理和運河港埠的調査，以及測量設計和實施等事宜，截至日本投降的時候，計已完成了全部遼河治本計劃方案，松花江治本計劃，也完成了十之五六，其餘各河，正在彙集資料中，至於治理計劃方案，尙未着手。</p>
<p>前項計劃方案，已設計和實施的（一）在水文方面：已設有水文氣象站八百七十四處，歷年測　記錄，都已　印成冊。（二）在蓄水防洪方面：計劃興修的蓄水庫，共十九處，其中已完成的有柳河的　得海，第二松花江的小　　，和牡丹江的鏡泊湖等蓄水庫三座，已　工尙未完成的，有東遼河·太子河·渾河等蓄水庫三座。（三）在灌漑排水方面二已施工尙未完成的工程，總計面積有二·九三二·五二九市畝，已完成收有水利效果的，有水早田四·四四〇·二〇五市畝。（四）在堤防整理方面：計劇培修的堤防，長五九七二公里，其中已經培修整理完竣的，約達半數。</p>
<p>此外，像水力發電，開闢運河，以及建設港埠等偉大工程，將再分別在下面做詳細的報道。</p>
<p>東北港埠設施</p>
<p>東北的港埠，除了大連和旅順兩港，因爲國際關係，建設已經日臻完善外，其餘各港埠，像大東·安東·營口·葫蔖島等四處，在敵人侵佔期間，都打算加以改善，惟因其對外正進行侵略，所有人力財力，幾全都用於有關軍事的事業，因之十餘年來，對營口·安東·葫蘆島各港的經營，沒有積極建設工程可說。</p>
<p>大東港的開發，日人認爲有利於本國和僞滿間的戰時運輸，且該港天然環境優良，又備其建立工業都市的條件，所以曾在民國廿六年，由滿鐵和僞滿政府，合資興辦。</p>
<p>大東港的建設計劃，約分三部：其一，是港灣和碼頭倉庫工程，建造目標，爲載重四〇〇〇公噸，吃水七·四公尺的船隻，在中潮水位，可自由行駛，並擬建有足容貨船四艘同時裝卸的碼頭和倉庫，其二，建造足容納一百萬人口的市區，佔地達一七六方公里的工業都市，其三，建築由大東通至安東長二四公里的鐵路工程，以上計劃，現已完成至何種程度，則因缺乏資料，所以尙未得知其詳。</p>
<p>開　南北運河</p>
<p>日僞訂劃開闢的運河有二：一爲連絡瀋陽，鞍山，營口間的水道——敵僞稱爲南滿運河，一爲貫通南北水系的松遼運河，前者日人曾於民國廿四年開始計劃，廿九年完成，關於用水問題，經詳細研究，認爲可確保無虞，惟尙未施工，至後者則在搜集資料階段，尙無具體計劃可考。</p>
<p>東北南部運河爲連絡營口，鞍山，瀋陽三市運河的總稱，共長二一九公里，其路綫爲由營口至唐馬寨，長九三公里，由此一去瀋陽，長一〇二公里，一向鞍山，長二四公里，在其全程路綫中，新開的河道，長八六公里，利用太子河的河道，長九五公里，利用遼河下游的水道，長三八公里，爲了調節各河道的水面差度，擬建造船閘十一座。</p>
<p>水利事業種種</p>
<p>南部運河的計劃，横斷面底，寬廿公尺，水面寬卅公尺，兩岸邊坡爲一比二五公尺，預計本工程一且完成，六〇〇噸的汽輪，可晝夜暢行，本工程全部預算，在民國廿九年估計時，需二六·一九〇·〇〇〇僞滿元，現在做起來，那要加上多少倍呢？</p>
<p>在早，東北的耕地，概屬早田，自從日人利用韓人種植水田以來，國人也多效法，九一八後，日人爲推行移民政策，特設置「農地開發事業局」等機構，主持開闢水田，其已造成和擬開闢的水田，遍佈松遼各水系的主要農業區域，其中規模較大的，計有東遼河灌漑區，遼河幹流灌漑區，海城河排水區，渾河灌漑區，松花江排水和灌漑區，牡丹江排水和灌溉區，倭肯河灌溉區，烏蘇里江灌溉區，鴨綠江灌溉區和盤山土地改良區等，其他散在各河流域的大小農田水利事業頗多，內中除了少數較小型工程已全部完成外，所剩大型灌溉區，則僅及完成一部，這個重担子，我們要肩負起來。</p>
<p>東北地廣物博，礦產和工業原料，蘊藏尤富，日人爲了掠奪開發，節省火力計，曾積極謀水力的發展，此項工作，自民國廿三年開始調査，至三十四年八月止，計已得四十五處，可築壩蓄水發電，全部預期平均發電量，共達三·二七四·〇〇〇瓩，其中除了松花江的小豐滿，牡丹江的鏡泊湖，以及鴨總江的水豐水電廠，已先後施工大致完成，鴨綠江的　州和　　，渾江的桓仁，太子河的身　等四處，已經施工而未完成外，其餘的則尙未辦理，已成功的，如果不被破壞和搬走了機器，已經很可觀了，若是個個完成，眞是一播偉大電力事業呢！</p>
<p>東北境內較大的河道，在南部的多淤塞水淺，在北部的多礁石難險，所以在九一八之前，其下游雖可通航，伹都各就其天然形勢，勉强航行，通航里程，也沒有詳細統計，自民國廿一年以後，日人爲了加强掠奪，配合陸路運輸起見，大加修理，南部以遼河做主幹，北部以松花江做主幹，兼及邊境河道的鴨綠江，烏蘇里江和黑龍江等，從事添築堤防，浚渫淺　，炸除礁石，築堰束水，築　蓄洪等工程，到了卅一年夏季，已有可航行輪船的水程七·一三九公里，木船的水程四·五二四公里，敵僞爲加强管制，曾設有哈爾濱·營口·安東等三航務局，分區管理船舶引水和航行標誌等事項，並開闢通往各埠的定期航錢，因之東北航運，日稱發達，惟自光復以還，河道日漸失修，且船舶損失殆盡，欲恢復舊觀，非再將河道加以整理，另添船雙，不易實現。</p>
<p>當前若干課題</p>
<p>目前東北情形，雖未完全安定，但在遼河和松花江兩大水系的平原裏，可能實施的水利事業，爲數已屬不少，日後應當舉辦的事業尤多，據水利委員會東北特派員辦公處負責人談，依照東北水利現在的情形，今後水利建設的急要事項，第一是恢復水文和氣象觀測站：東北的水文和氣象觀測站，計八七四處，　　人投降後，都已停頓，一年以來，記錄中斷，實至可惜，辦公處現已着手調査，就可能範圍的地點，予以分別恢復，計在國軍佔領區內的，可設百餘處，其餘將次第恢復。</p>
<p>第二，加强已成工程的養護管理：僞滿時期，已完成的工程，像達河的堤防，柳河的蓄水庫，以及各地的灌漑工程等，都應善爲養護管理，以免毁廢，按遼河下游和它的大小支流的堤防，除繞陽河外，已完成者達三千餘公里，然近年來失於養護修理，以致本年潰決百餘處，受災區域的七八縣，損失很重，所以已成工程的養護管理工作，必須加　·第三，完成僞滿時期已興工而朱完成的水利工程，敵僞在去年投降的時候，其已興工而未完成的和已究成而遭受損壞的，亟應及時復工，加以完成·</p>
<p>東北的水利事業，已往深爲日僞所重視，運轉純營，不遺餘力，一年來停頓荒廢，損失之大，無法統計，像各地水里的嚴重，農產的欠收，據東北行　經委會的統計，今年，僅水稻產量一項，只當平時產量百分之十七強，所以各方都企望水利事業，應予積極的發展，行總東北分署和聯總東北辦事處，以及各省市政府，迭次和水委會東北特派員辦公處，研討各地水利事業的復工事宜，並願負担一部工費和器材或者是人力，希望分別早日促成其事，這種艱鉅的工作，水委會實應早日在東北成立接替的永久機構，負責其事，好讓東北水利建設事業，在吾人接收以後，不伹不會漸趨荒廠，同時還要做到「水盡其利，地盡其用，」國計民生，在此一舉！</p>
<h3>集寧會戰插曲</h3>
<p>— 十月六日豐鎮訊　本報特約記者劉映元</p>
<p>邢冠軍的偉蹟</p>
<p>傅長官對集寗會戰的勝利，很謙虛的說：「這是人民意志的成功」，其實人民固然需要有一次勝利的集寗會戰，而能够達成人民意志的，也必須要有好的軍隊去執行。此次十二戰區獲得輝煌戰果，可以說完全是基於訓練精确，軍紀良好，和官兵的士氣旺盛。爲了說明這種因素，我們願意舉出一位人物，做爲十二戰區官兵的代表。此一代表是誰，就是佔領鐵軍山，倒打臥龍山，在九月十二日突城時殉國的「勝利」支隊第三大隊第二中隊中隊長邢冠軍少校。</p>
<p>提起邢冠軍三個字，早在廿八年包頭戰役時，就轟動了國防左翼前綫的每個兵營。他是山西渾源西留村的人，還是一個將門之後。他的曾組邢文形是武進士出身，前清道光年間。曾任羅恩舉的部將，平過西南的苗亂。不過到了他的祖父時代家境就逐漸衰落，因此他十三歲時就流落到</p>
<p>豐鎭；先在六十八師當兵，廿三年解決孫殿英時，在後套加入卅五軍。抗戰以後面才由號兵升成准尉號長·因爲包頭戰役時，他以一支銅號，十面國旗，和六顆手溜彈，佔領了一條財神廟街，五原戰役時最先拿下實行小學，傳長官破格把他升成少校中隊長。</p>
<p>冠軍不但自己會打仗，並且平日把戰友待成兄弟，訓練的個個生龍活虎，人人都會打仗。他的那一個中隊，足够十個中隊管用。集寗會戰時，他也是先把國旗抽到鐵軍山頂，看見「勝利」第二大隊攻不下臥龍山，便帶了一個中隊，穿過雨點似的機槍火網，從敵人的屁股後邊，領頭又把臥龍山拿下。十二日突城陣亡以後，「勝利」支隊的戰土，發出「爲邢冠軍復仇」的悲痛呼聲，一口氣鼓進西南城角。傳長官爲紀念邢冠軍的偉蹟，將鐵軍山更名冠軍由。『勝利」支隊長流着限淚和人們說：「邢冠軍這孩子今年才廿九歲，剛在陶林訂下一個媳婦，臨出發前退掉，他來到世界上，眞是爲了國家而生，爲了國家而死』。</p>

<h3>還鄉詩記</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>行前</p>
<p>我有點厭恨粉筆了，因爲粉筆生涯夾雜着煤烟塵灰磨倦了，我對浸浴在山翠水漪間的故鄉光景，只剩餘渺冥的夢影。這一學期，之江遷回老巢杭州去，雖然距鄉是近了，可是上海的家，沒有方法放棄，而且一家八口，靠粉筆來維持是够難的，於是我仍舊離敎而商。五年前，我不會忘記，那時期的恬靜之生，敎敎書，硏究研究自己的所好，但不久，敵騎連這塊護符下的乾凈土也侵入了，那時我在大夏，夢中得了一句詩：「千年坐老佛無情」。醒來足成七律，記得寫上黑板給同學看過，末兩句是「猾夏相逢雙八數，斯干惟見草烟橫」。雙八數，指八，一三與十二，八。從此我退隱於商，詩竟至做不出來，做出來的不過一派的憂憤，所謂「心如歷陵枯不，髮如睢陽亂絲」。而李拔可丈序我的「一塵草」中有云「爲八年來離憂抑鬱之育，莫不目覩瘡痍職禍而易其詩者」。瘡痍，我就是其中一個。我想，八年後的今日，總可以回復到舊時的恬靜之生，然而生活之鞭的高壓還是一樣，粉筆不可爲，鄉夢不可尋。秋天了，我更念系天末的古老鄕城，聽說，家眞的成了四壁，因爲一切器其，甚至一木一石統給同族不肖者盜賣了。連產權也起了動搖，這使我不得不一賦歸去，行前，歸心應該是包含喜的成分，可是那麼地煩亂，而翻覆着。</p>
<p>疲夢江湖未可量，</p>
<p>小休明日過錢塘；</p>
<p>喜心祗爲歸程計，</p>
<p>待看熹微破紙窗。</p>
<p>過松江</p>
<p>似乎是「如鳥脫樊籠，而復返自然」，在火車駛向遠郊，通過平蕪，叢林靑山，環抱碧波，是的，那是一幅大自然的畫圖，我許多年沒有看見了，雖則昨夜一夜不曾闔過眼，但還是很興奮，我不住凝看四周，連一株草，一片雲，都不忍讓它輕易掠過了視綫，不久，車到達松江站。，</p>
<p>松江，在滬杭綫是一個大站，更在後人眼裏是値得低徊憑弔的地方。因爲這裏有着「張翰」的故事。張翰，字季鷹，松江人，也是這樣的一個秋天，秋風起了，他忽然想到故鄉——松江的蒪菜鱸魚，就掛冠歸去。所以蒪鱸兩樣東西，成了松江的名產，其實，這「名」也者，不過沾了那故事的光，千載詩仙李太白也咏入了詩「此行不爲鱸魚膾，自愛名山入剡中」。至於張翰的歸思倒不是眞爲蒪鱸，他是一個知幾之士，覺得再貪戀下去沒有好結果，就借題出走，所謂「明哲保身」的意思。</p>
<p>在現在，這種思想自然要不得，可是有貪戀着官位的心就有超範圍的貪戀，而形之於事的就）團糟，誰又肯動張季鷹秋風江上歸思呢！</p>
<p>江流到此說蒪鱸，</p>
<p>不是懸車爲保身，</p>
<p>千載秋風虛一屐，</p>

<h3>以介眉壽</h3>
<p>— 吳湖帆</p>
<p>恭祝主席六十榮壽</p>
<h3>我與鏡子</h3>
<p>— 蘇旦</p>
<p>小時候對鏡子發生興趣，不減於放風箏和鬥蟋蟀一類玩意。那興趣是怎樣發生的，現在可難說了。但總不外由於好奇，爲什麼那樣亮晶晶而又纖塵不染？爲什麽能一點不走樣地把人底面貌和其他的東西都顯映了出來？這種疑問是有過的。雖問過母親和父親，但母親底回答很含糊，而父親所說的又是什麽水銀反射的字眼，心中也極不了然。所以在碰着一面鏡子的時候，那總是懷着奇異之想。</p>
<p>母親底房裏梳妝檯上有一而橄欖形的鏡子，於是我放學回來，把書包一扔，順便就凑在梳妝檯邊對着鏡子做幾個怪相：吐舌頭，撅嘴，聳眉擠眼，各種怪相怕都有了。而最常做的還是用兩隻手把眼和口同時扯大的一種所謂猫子相，像猫樣地呌幾聲之後，就一溜烟地跑到外面玩去了。有趣的是二在學校裏有時跟同學們吵閙，臉上塗了好幾筆墨跡回米，却又往往忘了凑到鏡子跟前去照，直待別人笑我，我才記起了鏡子。除此以外，在高興的時候，也會跑進房對鏡子做做怪相。尤其是從母親那兒得到一點什麼吃的東西，對鏡咀嚼，望着自己底嘴，像豬兒吃食一樣拱得很高，似乎是最感覺興趣一件事。</p>
<p>又有的時候，和一羣遊伴在太陽底下玩得正起勁，忽而想起了什麼，往母親房裏溜，偸偸摸摸地帶出那面橢圓形的鏡子，對着太陽照，把它底光反射在粉牆上，遠遠地望着那一團白光，再看看身邊遊伴們含有驚異和稱贊的眼色，心裏眞高興。隨手揮動，牆上的白光就幌動不已。興之所至，還拿來照遊伴底臉，呌他們不敢睜眼，低下頭來。其他如猫。狗·鷄·鴨子·豬都照過，甚至連在屋簷下安心唱着歌的麻雀，也常常被我底一道白光嚇飛了。</p>
<p>這種做法是有來歷的；那時我正看了些神怪小說，劍仙，俠客，妖魔之類，裝滿一腦子。知道有所訊「照妖鏡」，凡是妖魔鬼怪都會在它底下現出原形。於是自己也就模仿起來，以神仙自况，視手中的鏡子爲降魔伏妖的法寳了。</p>
<p>自然，這種玩意是母親所禁止的。偶爾爲母親發覺，總少不了挨一頓大駡，並且要奪去我手中的鏡子。我知道母親底不允許我這末玩，不完全是怕我失手跌破鏡子，而似乎也知道她還爲了點什麽，但却想不出這「什麼」究竟是什麽。一到黃昏，房裏剛暗，母親便把她底那面橄欖形的鏡子仆倒在檯上，這個動作成了她底習慣，沒有一天她會忘記。我問過這是什麼道理，也不止一次兩次，却從未得到回答。有時她還訶叱着：「不要多話」。於是，鏡子究竟是做什麼用的？愈是不解。而鏡子在我心目中也就更加神秘了。</p>
<p>隨着年齡的增長，鏡子底神秘在我心裏就像那初春的雪一樣，漸漸融化乾凈。對於母親在晚上仆倒鏡子的動作，也不再感覺奇怪。母親底腦子被迷信鬼神的觀念抓住，仆倒鏡子那是避忌諱的。我再也不立在鏡子面前做怪相或把它拿在太陽底下照人和狗猫了。要別個現出原形，自然是妄想。如今，偶爾回憶及此，眞覺得好笑。兒時的意識不純是屬於夢的境界麼？</p>
<p>我這樣想：鏡子有什麼大作用呢？給人或物的不過是浮雕的再現。一切存在的，莫不各有其本身存在的因素。所以，我現在是不愛鏡子了。猶之我不宣歡一個輕佻而又愛施欺騙的人一樣</p>
<p>三年前，我離開家，跋山涉水跑到重慶去，也還把一面翡翠色的鏡子揣在行李帶了去。現在我到上海來了，這面鏡也還掛在我寢室裏的牆壁上。由於它經歷多年，已經斷了一隻脚，形色大改。但稱幷不因此而稍感憮然。除了梳洗或必須整理一下衣帽的時候，在它面前幌一幌外，總不大去睬它。因爲我以爲鏡中的我，未必就是我自己。稱自己還得往深處尋找。</p>
<h3>題竹塘圖</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>靑羊兄出示竹塘圖，瀟　出塵，頗有山林之樂，率題絕句：</p>
<p>草滿郊原水滿塘，蕭蕭風起入幽　；披圖猛憶兒時樂，結伴踏靑盡日忙。</p>
<h3>題二叟觀瀑圖</h3>
<p>— 孫靑羊</p>
<p>贈潘公展先生</p>
<p>霜葉悄然落，　秋山漸覺寒，</p>
<p>淸泉猶潔白，　騰瀉出幽岩；</p>
<p>長者有奇僻，　游屐達此間，</p>
<p>偏愛林堅勝，　流連不忍還；</p>
<p>世途多豪舉，　無復顧眞山。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　80</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>有了這帶口信的事由，我們又儘量利用了這個機會，說了些讓她愛聽的話，她很高興，怨我們老不上寨子裏來，弄得面生了。我們趁這機會，要求她替我們找個安靜的所在，休息一下。妙想了一說「招賢堂」在三點之前，倒是很安靜的；三點以後，賭博開塲，花姑娘上市，就要熱閙了。我們吿訴她，一夜不曾好好休息，得有個地方躺躺，正不願參加這個熱鬧。她說只要不嫌　，可以到她的屋子裏去，那裏有大炕，也沒人去吵鬧。這是一個很合理想的所在。我們預先賞了她兩元軍用券，名義是請她也　們安排兩盆炸醬麪條。</p>
<p>這女人說「只要不嫌　」，我以爲她在客氣。直到他領我們進一了這個屋子，才知道她說的確是實話。這屋子不僅一個　字包含得下，頭一個不通空氣，隔室就是廚房，那燒菜的油味和煤火的煙薰，不斷地從板壁縫裏透了過來，簡直薰得人作嘔。虎弟說這是「第十九層油煙地獄」。可是我們就在這裘吃了麪條，並且討論計劃我們　備　手要幹的事。</p>
<p>我們第一步把禁衛區裏面的地形，畫了一個簡圖，就老侉供給我們的資料，把路線，障碍，汽汕堆棧，軍火庫，崗位，娛樂塲，等等，假定了一個大略。我們爭執着一個不同點；虎弟要混到娛樂塲內去把殷逆幹掉，我主張看事行事，能够燬掉軍火庫或汽油棧，便足够消滅一下敵寇的氣熖，給他們一下打擊。我用利與害的辯證方法，把虎弟屈服了。因爲殷逆雖是一個禍根，可是他的一條性命，還不値一條狗命。就算弄掉他，日寇立刻就可再裝上一個傀儡。</p>
<p>其次，我們又討論到撤退的方法。在我的想像中，我認爲最安全的辦法，是讓所幹的事情，在我們撤退之後才暴露，方爲上策。要曉得這是一個虎穴，我們再厲害些；也只有兩雙腿兩雙手。無論如何，應當儘量避免顯明的衝突。</p>
<p>這撤退的問題，還未解決，虎弟已經倒在　上，沉沉睡去。我本也有些睜不開眼睛了，但因環境危險，只好勉强支持着·這種情形，比較在關外打游　還要難受。打游擊的時候。雖不免日炙，風吹，雨打，寒侵，却有的是新鮮空氣。這間屋子，不說新鮮空氣，連風也不通，空氣裏的油煙，簡直可以一把一把抓在手裏；而且天氣又是異常的燠悶，簡直使人窒息或中暑。</p>
<p>不記得什麽時時候，我也例在炕上睡熟了，只知道方睡得正甜，突然被一聲巨響驚醒，一翻身坐了起來，心上不覺突突地亂跳；那個巨響，却又奇怪，一直不斷地還在耳輪裏滾着。稍稍定了定神，仔細聽了聽，才聽出這是一片鑼鼓聲響，就在隔室發出，震得頭昏腦脹。同時又覺得週身十分難過，莫明其妙難過。「不是病了吧？」心下這麼想着，但稍一撫摩，不覺失笑，原來身上的衣服，被汗浸得層層透過，濕膩膩地塌在身上。一看虎弟，仍舊睡得正甜。摸了摸他的頭額，却是乾微微地，一點汗星都沒有。後來聽說，這是練過氣功的原因。</p>
<p>費了好些手續，才弄明白；原來我們這間屋子，是個暗房；一面通着廚房，一而正是「招賢堂」的俱樂部，通常在這裏閙着京劇，或是練習，或是淸唱，或是坤班登塲，也有時是玩耍的客串，反正熱鬧作樂就是了。其他的兩面牆壁那邊，却是賭塲。這時也上塲了。我們這間房，一天二十四小時，惟一的光線，至靠屋頂上幾片明瓦，和一盞五支光的小電燈。</p>

<h3>硬與軟</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>香港一賣花生的小販，被印警踢斃，該印警雖交有司在鞫訊中，但全體留港的居民憤懣之情仍未稍息，可能會引起一件較大風潮來。前天出版的十七期新聞天地月刋中，適巧有「血汗黃金滋養香港」的一篇文章，足以供給我們作爲明瞭當地政府的政策的參考，其中有這麽一節：</p>
<p>就在天星小輪的碼頭上，一個皇家海軍得意洋洋地舉起玻璃瓶向一個盛裝少婦的頭顱敲過去，可憐的玉人，頭破血流，美麗的臉也給玻璃割傷，皇家海軍部大搭大擺地昂頭而去，這是代表「硬」政策的一面，政策的執行人在「軟」的一面最成功的把戲，就是最近大送紅十字會的救濟糧食包。每戶一包，無條件贈送，包內有十多隻罐頭，喫得人人嘴裏都叫好。皇家海軍玻璃瓶所流的血跡，都給那些糧食包遮掩得一乾二凈。這軟硬兩而的政策，堪稱英人統治殖民地的「傑作」。</p>
<p>印警自然是以統治者的身分出現，否則他怎敢任意魚肉小民？狗仗主勢，如果主子氣派依然，那將來像這類的事更會層出不窮的發生哩。自然，現在香港當局對此案是在盡量施用軟功了。</p>
<p>收回香港，是我們應該據理力爭的目標之一，伹更須努力的是要改變那種自命優秀民族的帝國主義的思想觀念。</p>
<h3>靑春都爲愛消磨　溫莎伉儷老矣</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>愛德華溫莎當一八九四年六月二十三日誕生時，他已經是一位公爵的兒子，自幼受到良好的家庭教育，十三歲入海軍學校爲見習生，經過兩年的鍜鍊，升爲士官候補生，曾隨巡洋艦受海上訓練三個月。當他十六歲時，他的父親喬治五世登帝位，溫莎便成爲王太子，依舊在海軍中供職。他的性格溫良誠懇，少年時代的海洋生活，更使他的胸懷寬暢，他是英國歷朝皇族中最喜歡旅行的第一人，他從遊歷中體騐到宮廷以外的眞實人生，他曾說：「海是我的宗敎。」他所追尋的祇是常人一般的生活，對失業和陋巷居住問題，他曾熱心硏究改進方法，他看不慣貴族人物的傲慢驕矜，因此他在肚交塲中所遇見的皇族婦女，伹覺虛僞可哂，直到四十二歲，他仍然過着獨身生活。</p>
<p>讓我們把時間回到一八九五年，在美國華盛頓城東北的波的麻市內，有一個女孩，題名佩希·華斐爾的，呱呱墮地。她的生父是一所公萬主人，當她兩歲時便已逝世，剩下這女孩和她的母親相依爲命，家境貧寒，促成她像浮萍般的身世，她在二十一歲時，下嫁史本塞中尉，婚禮在一九一六年十一月八日舉行，他們的夫婦關係到一九二五年的脫離爲止。後來，她因拍網球和紐約郵船公司高級職員辛浦森夫婦認識，辛先生便和妻干離異，在一九二八年與佩希在倫敦結婚，從此，地便成了辛浦森夫人，出入於英國首都的交際塲所。</p>
<p>溫莎和佩希，就在這時候在宴曾上見面認識，其時溫莎已登帝位，依舊保持一貫的平民思想，佩希儀態溫柔，又因飽經世故，談吐之間，兩人遂成莫逆，感情日漸增厚，一九三四年以後，大不列顚的帝君，簡直不能離開辛浦森夫人片刻。一九三六年十二月，爲了溫莎與辛夫人的婚烟問題，國會不通過，他寗願拋棄了皇座，取得婚姻的自主，造成轟傳全球的談討資料。</p>
<p>一九三七年六月三日，他們便以溫莎公爵和華斐爾女士的名義，在法國舉行結婚，儀式簡單，賀客連同新聞記者，總數不過五十人。</p>
<p>以後，溫莎公爵被任爲美洲附近的一個英國屬島的總督，十年以來，關於他夫婦倆的行動，各國報章都不時有記載。曰前他們返抵英國，這是一九三九年九月以後的第一次回國探視。</p>
<p>溫莎公爵夫婦，今歲都已年過半百，結婚十年，夫妻的感情始終恩愛如一，溫莎從來不曾想到因爲失去帝位而後悔，溫莎夫人看情形也將以第三嫁作爲永久的歸宿，他們已經替人類建立不朽的功績；他們爲歷史寫下了愛情的偉大！</p>
<h3>腰身加大了</h3>
<p>— 張逸人</p>
<p>荷蘭的安姆史達（Amsterdam）爲世界著名金融市塲之一·那邊有一個馬戲團，坐位向來不分號數，是一統的長凳，戰時能容三千四百位觀衆，自從戰爭結束和平恢復以來，爲期一年餘，馬戲國只能容納三千一百六十位觀衆了。還有二百五十位觀衆戲團方面只得謝絕。這就是說戲國當局無形中每塲損失了二百五十張票子的價錢哩！</p>
<p>起初，主其事者弄得莫明其妙，百思不得一解，後來他總究知道了其中的秘密；發現大戰勝利一年以來荷蘭人普通的腰身已加大了三時。到底世界和平有補於他們的生活；他們毋需再節衣縮食，他們現在可以享受太平時期的一切東西，因此他們的身體亦加胖了！</p>
<p>但看我們國人，他們的腰身究竟加大了幾許？</p>

<h3>舞女及舞廳　3</h3>
<p>— 嘉謨</p>
<p>據查最近在市府警局登記的舞女，總數達二千零三十二名。全市舞塲計二十五家。（小舞塲尙有未列入）。其名稱及分配人數如下：</p>
<p>仙樂　四六人</p>
<p>百樂門　三〇人</p>
<p>大都會　三六人</p>
<p>維也納　八五人</p>
<p>大東　一四一人</p>
<p>維納司　九九人</p>
<p>金山　四九人</p>
<p>皇宮　六二人</p>
<p>聖太樂　二五人</p>
<p>中央　一二三人</p>
<p>新都會　二四人</p>
<p>大路　一〇一人</p>
<p>華都　一五六人</p>
<p>麗都　七〇人</p>
<p>新仙林　八五人</p>
<p>大滬　一二三人</p>
<p>米高美　一〇一人</p>
<p>大華　九〇人</p>
<p>新華　四五人</p>
<p>遠東　六〇人</p>
<p>揚子　一〇三人</p>
<p>國泰　四八人</p>
<p>國聯　三一人</p>
<p>勝利　八六人</p>
<p>高峯　五八人</p>
<p>紅星現在舞塲中的舞女分爲坐位子與不坐位子的兩個級別。便是列坐在舞池四周的位子上的算一種，不坐位子，而等待舞客呌坐檯子時才出來的，又是一種。這就是所謂「紅星」與「非紅星」之別。大抵紅星的數目約佔全體百份之十五至十八。</p>
<p>做到紅星，就需要在「色」，「藝」，「交際」，「氣派」各方面有特長的方才及格。她們手下都需有一大批客人川流不息地來捧塲和納費。可是她們還是不能單靠正當舞票的收入來維持的。因爲即以一夜轉檯六次計，（　次平均一萬元舞票），充其量她也祇兌現得到三萬現金。這是不足她們的浩大支出的。她們最大的入款還是要依靠闊客們的巨額配給，而這其間的微妙關係與交換條件，自然是値得外人去揣測的。（未完）</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>新榖</p>
<p>凡百物價飛漲聲中新榖已吿登塲，照理農民可以　一口氣了，但是上海附近的幾個產米都市，米價日見低落，四鄕農民急於求售，更造成去胃不暢的局面，秈米竟暴跌至每石三萬三千元；銀行裏對農民的貸款據說除了店保之外還要金條，鄕下八有幾個能從田土裏掘出金條來的？於是在高物價的威脅下，農民們不得不求諸於暗息三角以上的高利貸。這種剜肉補瘡的現象，恐怕已　不及我們在硏究室裏擬好一點什麽「整理農村經濟計劃」之類再來做施救工作了。寒冬即届，耕具未修，儘管都市裏的人們現在都被奶粉，魚肝油補昏了頭，但我們的生活基礎，目前仍將建立在那一片廣漠靑沃的土地上的。這一點道理不知道在大家暫時離開「玻璃世界」而當午夜夢　的時候，曾否捫心思索一番？</p>
<p>回頭鼠</p>
<p>戰後的日本怎樣？恐怕我們大部份人都把它遺忘了！紐約時報說：「在戰敗之軸心國中，日本已有最速復蘇之徵象；日本人民仍積極强幹，似並未因戰敗而氣餒」。最重要的還有：「日本工業之恢復，已足以應付國內之用及大量輸出」。改造社並說：「日本已奉命製造呢絨，將輸出遠市市塲。」恐怕正因爲這些關係吧？貝文在下院演說中，已有「極願與日本締結特久和平」的聲明，日讀賣新聞主筆馬塲，也就眉飛色舞的說；「爲締造世界和平起見，聯合國應在日本存儲一批原子炸彈，而責成愛好和平的日本加以保管。」好傢伙！你　他們多麼神氣活現！你看他們不是又把「嵌金木盒」的壽禮呈獻過來了嗎？接着那些「奉命」製造的大批呢絨又將供應過來了！我們在厭倦了被璃製品的享受之餘，是否準備再打起精神來接受這份殷勤？</p>
<p>東風西漸</p>
<p>美國爲促進戰後復員所推行的「殘廢人士自力更生遝動」，展開已近兩年，這中間不知道有多少戰場負傷歸來的無名英雄們，都已經在斷肢折肱的苦痛中，毫無遺憾的承受了社會上珍貴溫情的撫慰。最近聽說他們的國會中又通過了一件實施「國定聘用殘廢人士週」的法案，預備更廣泛的再展開一次以人類同情愛作出發點的救濟運動。眞想不到作爲我們國粹之一的「禮運大同篇」中「鰥寡孤獨廢疾者，皆有所養」的所謂盛世之象，倒給人家快着先鞭，做得與我們先賢的哲訓若合符節。反觀我們自己：街頭巷尾許多在戰爭山失掉健康、勝利後因求生乏術而淪爲乞丐的一羣，却在人們漠視，鄙夷厭惡的眼光中，委地求生，宛轉欲死。古今中外，不平之事，莫過於此！但是目今，一切都變了！人們善於適應種種傷心慘目的現象，即使是有些看不順眼，但看償了，也就順限了，大家都覺得無所謂！</p>

<h3>Government Representatives Meet with the Chairman; U.S. Ambassador Remains in Nanjing Awaiting New Developments in the Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu were summoned by the Chairman at 7:30 PM on the 1st to report on everything. Hu Lin also met with the Chairman at 4 PM. U.S. Ambassador Stuart was also present. They researched the prospects for peace talks. Hu visited Stuart at 11 PM. Mo Dehui visited the U.S. Ambassador and talked for two hours. In the afternoon, the Democratic League and social figures continued to hold meetings. After the meeting, Liang Shuming visited Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] According to a certain authoritative source, any form of negotiation at present seems unable to affect the established opinions insisted upon by the Communist Party, and it is not easy to find a way to solve the problem. The government will still proceed according to the Chairman's instructions, such as convening a military three-person meeting, an informal five-person group, and reviewing the draft constitution.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures suggested changing the form of peace talks, with direct talks between the KMT and the CCP and mediation by the Democratic League, etc., which is the so-called informal comprehensive talks with three parties participating. Another method is to convene a Political Consultative Conference comprehensive group. This suggestion still changes the form without changing the content. According to the spokesperson of the CCP delegation on the morning of the 1st, the crux of the matter is still the three points of immediate and unconditional ceasefire, reorganization of the National Government, and submission of the list of National Assembly representatives. The principles will not be changed, and no matter how the form changes, no agreement can be reached. The spokesperson also insisted that the Communist Party urgently demands an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. At the same time, the reorganization of the National Government should include the Executive Yuan, and the list of National Assembly representatives must be submitted to the reorganized National Government. The National Assembly must be convened after all consultations.</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Nanjing, 1st] According to a certain government official tonight, direct negotiations between the KMT and the CCP with leaders of third parties present will begin soon. The ultimate fate of the negotiations depends on the developments in the next ten days.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 1st] The U.S. Ambassador was originally scheduled to fly to Beiping this morning, but it was temporarily cancelled. According to those around the Ambassador, the Ambassador hopes that there will be new developments in the situation, so he stayed in Nanjing to maintain contact with all parties.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, This City] Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi, Li Huang, and Democratic League representative Huang Yanpei arrived in Shanghai by train on the morning of the 1st.</p>

<h3>Main Force of Communist Army in Rehe Enters Territory; Artillery War Breaks Out Again in Eastern Hebei; National Army in Northern Section of Pinghan Railway Moves South in Two Routes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 1st] The main force of the Communist army in eastern Hebei, after being defeated by the National Army and driven away, scattered in the countryside. Small groups have recently reassembled, attempting to destroy the hinterland of the Beining Railway. At 9:00 PM on October 29th, the National Army stationed near Qian'an and in the triangular area of Luan County, Lulong, and Qian'an was suddenly attacked by the Communist army. The two sides engaged in fierce artillery battles. As of the 30th, the sound of artillery fire was still rumbling. After a period of silence, the flames of war in eastern Hebei have begun to spread. According to reports, some of the main force of the Communist army has been transferred from Rehe and is eager to show its strength. It is generally believed that ensuring the safe operation of the Beining Railway and firmly defending the points and lines is important, and the northern side is particularly important. Currently, the commander of the National Army division is stationed at Leizhuang Station on the Beining Railway, commanding his troops in combat. The commander of the Eastern Hebei Pacification Command, Hou Jingru, has set up a command post in Tangshan and will begin active work in the near future. In addition, Commander Sun Lianzhong of the Eleventh War Zone, in order to understand the situation of all party, government, and military measures in the counties of eastern Hebei after repeated recovery, and to plan for reorganization and improvement, has sent commissioners to inspect.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 1st] There was no major change in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway on the 1st. According to the headquarters, a certain division of the 53rd Army on the right wing and the 94th Army on the front have joined forces in the same city. They have now moved south in two routes with the National Army in Xincheng on the left wing. As of 6:00 PM on the 1st, there was no news of reaching Xushui. The Communist army is heavily concentrated between Xushui and Caohe.

Affected by regional warfare, the National Army is far inferior to the Communist Army in number. Therefore, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not yet been able to join forces.

<h3>Unity of Business Circles at Home and Abroad; Inauguration of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions Encouraging the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The inaugural meeting of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry was solemnly opened at the Union Recreation Club of this unit at 9:30 AM on the 1st. Three hundred and twenty-one representatives from forty-three units at home and abroad attended. Shanghai representatives Wang Yansong, Jin Runxiang, etc. arrived before the meeting. Government leaders who participated included President Song's representative Wang Xuewu, and Chen Lifu, Chen Shuren, Ma Chaojun, Gu Zhenggang, etc. The ceremony was conducted as follows: Chairman Wang Yaolai delivered a speech, saying: The Federation of Commerce and Industry is a comprehensive organization of the national industrial and commercial circles, which is still an innovation in the history of our country. The enthusiastic participation of representatives from all over the country, uniting as one, is truly commendable. It is even more gratifying that compatriots who are focusing on embracing the motherland and compatriots from the Northeast who have learned valuable lessons from fourteen years of suffering have gathered here. Our task is arduous. The urgent problems at present are to determine economic policies and save the industrial and commercial crisis. Not only do all regions expect this association to find ways to coordinate and solve these problems, but the government also hopes that this association can provide practical suggestions. I hope that the delegates will contribute valuable opinions. After the speech, the Chairman's instructions were announced (summary): "Your association is convening its inaugural meeting on November 1st this year, bringing together representatives of industry and commerce from provinces and cities across the country to review gains and losses and seek countermeasures for the present situation, in order to gather ideas and benefit from them. It is truly a grand event. I would like to share several matters with you for mutual encouragement: In the Industrial Plan, the National Father once pointed out that in order to maintain world peace, we should prevent commercial wars and then eradicate wars of force, and said: "I also want international cooperation to help China's development, so as to avoid future trade wars." Although today's world situation is constantly evolving, the National Father's practical instructions are still a timely compass. I deeply hope that our country's industrial and commercial circles will inherit this intention, recognize the current situation, and seek development, so as to become a stable force in international commercial competition, so as to enhance the glory of the national history. The victory of the War of Resistance has only just begun. Due to the difficulty of things, industry and commerce cannot show a prosperous scene. How should we promote them in the future? It must be in your careful consideration. For example, how to stabilize prices so that they do not affect social life? How to use wandering funds so that they focus on production? In particular, how to improve domestic products so that they reach the level of self-sufficiency? As for how to control the sales of foreign goods so that they can regulate materials without hindering the industrial and commercial distribution. All of these are what the government has been thinking about day and night, but in order to achieve satisfactory results, we still rely on the power of society to support us. You are models of the industrial and commercial circles, and at this gathering, I hope that you will thoroughly discuss the situation and exert your outstanding vision, so that industry and commerce can be revitalized in time to help the success of national construction. This is what I earnestly hope for, Zhongzheng's government has merchants." (More news about the Federation of Commerce and Industry, please see page 2.)</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce and Industry General Assembly Passes Resolution Supporting Chairman's Eight Proposals, Designates November 1st as Merchants' Day, Representatives from Various Regions Bitterly Complain of Serious Industrial and Commercial Crisis</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The National Federation of Commerce and Industry held its first general assembly at 3:30 PM on the 1st. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the preparation process, followed by discussions and resolutions: (1) Sending a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay tribute; (2) Submitting a telegram to Chairman Chiang endorsing eight proposals, such as convening the National Assembly as scheduled and implementing constitutional government; (3) Passing the proposal of the Guizhou representative to designate November 1st as Merchants' Day. Representatives from various regions then reported on the situation of the Commerce and Industry Federations and the current situation of industry and commerce in their respective regions. The first to report was Shanghai representative Luo Qinghua, who said: The industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai is similar to that in other places in the country, all in a serious crisis and approaching collapse. The main pressures are three: (1) High interest rates: Due to the government's adoption of inflation and financial tightening, legitimate businesses are unable to obtain loans and have to pay high interest rates of 18% or 20% in the black market, suffocating industry; (2) High wages: Shanghai's cost of living has increased by 4,800 to 5,000 times. Workers' base salaries have also increased, so workers' salaries have increased more than 20,000 times compared to before, increasing production costs, and labor disputes continue to occur; (3) Foreign goods are dumped in our country, and Shanghai is the first to bear the brunt, and commerce is declining day by day. Due to the above three reasons, the industrial and commercial crisis is becoming more and more serious. In July of this year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other groups formed a petition group to come to Beijing. Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council also formed a petition group to petition the central government. The former has been instructed by the government, but it has not touched the real source of the disease, nor has it proposed relief measures to address the crisis. The Shanghai representatives have put forward a variety of specific suggestions and hope that they can be resolved at this grand meeting.</p>
<p>Zhejiang representative Zhu Huiqing reported, briefly stating: Due to the impact of the war in Zhejiang Province, production facilities have been almost completely destroyed, and production has shrunk. Silk production is less than one-third of that before the war, and tea is less than half, and the future is worrying.</p>
<p>Xikang representative Sun Jiangjian reported, saying: Xikang is indeed a barren land, but the underground is rich in deposits. I hope you can pay attention to the southwest and develop the deposits.</p>
<p>Tianjin representative Liu Xisan reported that Tianjin needs a huge amount of dredging fees every year due to the Haihe River problem, which hinders transportation and is extremely inconvenient. I hope that the Tanggu New Port can be completed as soon as possible. This is not only a blessing for Tianjin, but also a benefit for the entire North China.</p>
<p>The Mexican representative delivered a speech, hoping to develop overseas commerce, and suggested organizing a shipping company to sail to North and South America to carry our country's special products such as silk and tea and exchange them for foreign gold, silver, and banknotes to return to the country. The most suffering of the overseas Chinese in Mexico is that they cannot return to their country after making a fortune overseas. I hope you can pay attention to this point, and emphasize the importance of compatriots at home and abroad working together. The speech was impassioned and won a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Jiangsu representative Lu Xiaobo reported that the people have experienced the war and the War of Resistance, which can be said to be riddled with holes. After that, there was a currency devaluation of 200 to 1, which made the people even more wounded. The takeover work was also not satisfactory. Materials were either rotten or broken, and some even disappeared. It is painful to say this. The war damage suffered by northern Jiangsu is even more indescribable. Light industries with fragile foundations in terms of industry and commerce have been collapsing due to the lack of funds and the dumping of foreign goods. Commerce is also suffering unspeakable pain due to heavy taxes.</p>
<p>Representatives from Fujian, Shanxi, Sichuan, Anhui, and other places also gave brief reports. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. The second general assembly will be held on the morning of the 2nd to continue listening to reports.</p>
<h3>Premier Song's Address: More Than Policy Decisions, Action Is Essential</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier Song's address to the Federation of Commerce stated, in full: The inaugural meeting of the Republic of China Federation of Commerce is being held in the capital. Due to official duties, Ziwen is unable to attend this grand occasion in person, which I deeply regret. I hereby entrust Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to convey my congratulations and briefly express my humble opinions as follows: Since the victory, transportation in various regions has been disrupted, production has declined, tax revenue is difficult to collect, budgets are unbalanced, materials are scarce, and prices are soaring, leading to frequent labor strikes and social unrest, resulting in a situation of hardship and crisis. The Executive Yuan, in overseeing all administrative matters, bears an inescapable responsibility. It has directed the relevant ministries to plan and implement measures in various aspects, including restoring transportation, increasing material production, rectifying various taxes, utilizing enemy and puppet assets, opening up foreign trade, adjusting foreign exchange rates, and mediating labor-management disputes, aiming to address both immediate and fundamental issues, simplify complexity, and gradually achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and improving people's livelihoods. However, eliminating today's economic crisis involves myriad complex issues and requires comprehensive planning. The above measures are merely emergency responses and not fundamental solutions. The attendees of the Federation of Commerce are all leaders of industry and commerce from various regions, and their observations on the current hardships of the industrial and commercial sectors are undoubtedly profound. If they can seize this valuable opportunity, use their keen observations to conduct thorough research and discussion together, and generate concrete proposals to guide policy implementation, the government will certainly do its utmost to meet their earnest expectations. Furthermore, economic issues are closely interconnected, and the government and the people are inseparable. National impoverishment naturally leads to depleted resources, while national wealth must begin with enriching the people. Overcoming today's difficulties requires not only the government's efforts but also the self-awareness and self-governance of industrialists and businessmen, unity of purpose, endurance of hardship, and concerted cooperation to achieve success. The Federation of Commerce is the highest organization of the industrial and commercial sectors nationwide. How it will lead the industry, assist the government, promote economic laws and regulations, and promote industrial and commercial development in the future is the most serious issue. It is hoped that the attendees will share the difficulties of the times, maintain unwavering loyalty, not only make policy decisions but also demonstrate action, to overcome the current crisis, strive for future development, and further secure the country on a foundation of stability, and elevate the people to a state of well-being and happiness. Then today's meeting will truly be related to the rise and fall, prosperity and decline of the nation and the people. I cannot help but place my hopes on it.</p>
<h3>Speeches by Government Leaders: Gu Zhenggang Encourages with Three Matters, Wang Yunwu Urges Attention to Three Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Chen Lifu's speech at the National Federation of Commerce stated, in brief: The establishment of the Federation of Commerce signifies a great spiritual unity of Chinese merchants and marks a new era in commercial history. With the victory of the War of Resistance and the beginning of national construction, the responsibility of merchants is even greater. I hope they can strengthen themselves, increase internal and external connections, thereby enhancing the welfare of merchants and contributing to the country. After the speech, Premier Song delegated Wang Yunwu to deliver an address (see above).</p>
<p>Following that, Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, encouraging the representatives with three matters: (1) To seek the sound development of industry and commerce through a sound industrial and commercial organization. The conference should solemnly select directors and supervisors, pay attention to the selection of personnel and regional distribution, and strengthen domestic and overseas connections to rescue the economic crisis; (2) The demands of industry and commerce should be mutually adapted to the government's economic policies. When reviewing industrial and commercial interests, attention should be paid to the overall national interest; (3) To solve problems, one should not only solve the proposals.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu's speech stated, in brief: In this era of organized economics, the importance of the Federation of Commerce is self-evident. It is hoped that it can have a long-term vision, act in accordance with laws and regulations, consider the national interest, seek economic recovery, and pay attention to the following points: (1) The purpose of the Federation of Commerce is to facilitate the flow of goods and compete in the international market, which is extremely important. Since the recovery, imports have significantly exceeded exports. Encouraging exports is a consistent government policy, but it also relies heavily on the efforts of industry and commerce. Adjustments to foreign exchange rates, exemptions from export tariffs, and subsidy policies for export businesses have been implemented in order. It is hoped that industry and commerce can also make their own efforts to rescue the crisis. (2) It is hoped that they will continuously improve their technical management knowledge to complete industrial construction. (3) Strengthening the organization itself will not only increase its own interests but also benefit the national economy.</p>
<p>Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, stated, in brief: Overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the development of foreign trade. It is hoped that overseas Chinese can invest more in the country, conduct more inspections, and strengthen connections with domestic industry and commerce. At the same time, it is hoped that domestic compatriots can also travel overseas for tourism.</p>
<h3>Central Cooperative Treasury Opens for Business Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Agricultural Bank Holds Administrative Meeting: Chairman Issues Instructions, Indicating Current Fundamental Priorities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The fifth administrative meeting of the Chinese Farmers Bank was held at the bank's headquarters at 9:00 AM today. A total of 91 people attended, including Chairman Chen Guofu, Standing Directors Chen Qicai and Wu Tiecheng, Supervisor Wang Xicun, General Manager Li Shuming, heads of various departments of the headquarters, and managers of branches across the country. The meeting was chaired by Li Shuming, who first read the instructions from Chairman Chiang, Premier Song, and Minister Yu Hongjun. Chen Qicai then gave a speech, encouraging the bank to provide as much assistance as possible to the restoration of rural businesses in various provinces, especially in the development of agricultural production and processing. Wu Tiecheng stated: The Agricultural Bank has always strived to implement the Party's agricultural policies. In the future, its mission to revitalize rural areas, promote economic construction, and complete the Three Principles of the People will be even more significant. Li Shuming pointed out that the Agricultural Bank's mission in the future will be to take responsibility for revitalizing agricultural finance and achieving rural industrialization. Chen Guofu emphasized that the Agricultural Bank's business should penetrate deep into rural areas and pay close attention to actual needs in the future. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and all personnel went to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for a memorial service. The first plenary session was held in the afternoon, with heads of various departments of the headquarters presenting work reports.</p>
<p>The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is recorded below: "Farmers in our country account for 80 percent of the total population, but agricultural production and the rural economy have so far stagnated in the outdated methods of the Middle Ages and have rarely been improved. This not only impoverishes the lives of all the people but also causes the construction of the entire country to stagnate. Therefore, although national construction today is a complex undertaking, improving agricultural production and enriching the rural economy, so that they can adapt to the steps of modern science, is the most fundamental and priority task at present. How can we improve production? Mechanization of cultivation is the most urgent priority. How can we enrich the economy? Rural industrialization is particularly important. These are both the greatest responsibilities of this bank in the future, and it is also a major policy of this bank to transform the past passive work of rural relief into the active work of rural construction. It is deeply hoped that all comrades at this administrative meeting will recognize the goals, broaden their horizons, open up new paths for business, and establish effective plans to complete this epoch-making mission, and live up to the original intention of Zhongzheng (Chiang's given name) in establishing this bank. I have great expectations."</p>

Currently, these two obstacles are gradually disappearing. Health administration should immediately plan to expand its work and strive for construction. Therefore, this meeting is convened to discuss the following matters: (1) Changes in the financial system and reduced provincial income will inevitably affect health administration, which is based on the province as a unit. How should we find ways to solve the funding problem? (2) Expansion of frontier health administration and medical equipment; (3) Establishing uniform standards for business, eliminating the situation where each unit acts on its own, jointly preventing and controlling epidemics, and improving people's livelihoods; (4) The supply and distribution of national medicines, and the cultivation and regulation of talent; (5) The utilization of relief materials and their coordination with various social undertakings, etc. I sincerely hope that the participants will brainstorm and discuss enthusiastically, so that health administration can have a high degree of development and reach perfection, in order to achieve the important task of saving the people and strengthening the race."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Subtle State of the Chinese Situation</h3>
<p>The Chinese situation today has truly entered a state of "subtlety"! Can it be said to be bright? Shadows are clearly present, not only shadows, but also layers of clouds and mist that seem to be rushing out from the mountain valleys. Can it be said to be dark? The signs of a major thunderstorm of the past three or four months seem to have passed, and the clouds and mist seem to have dissipated a lot in the past half month. Furthermore, seeing the atmosphere of universal joy and celebration among the people on the Chairman's birthday the day before yesterday, everyone will be able to recognize where the true public opinion lies and where the hopes for China's future rest. A bright future, how can one close one's eyes and deny it? The Chinese situation is currently on the edge of darkness and light, perhaps like the dawn after a long night.</p>
<p>Let us look back at the developments in the situation over the past month, which can truly be described as a sudden rise and fall, magnificent and imposing. Since the CCP's statement on July 30, demanding a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, otherwise considering the peace talks to have broken down, the situation was almost at a dead end. Although the suggestion from Envoy Marshall for a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou was agreed to by the government, the CCP resolutely rejected it, and the situation moved even closer to the brink. Fortunately, the Chairman's National Day broadcast expressed that the government always hoped for sincere negotiations, and the door to peace talks remained wide open. When the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou on the 11th, the government ordered the National Assembly to convene as scheduled on November 12, and the situation seemed to indicate a storm was coming. However, through the efforts of various parties, factions, and social elites, on the 16th, the Chairman issued a public statement, presenting eight strategies for handling the situation, which then led to the entry of CCP representatives and representatives of other parties and factions into Beijing on the 21st. The resentment gradually dissipated, and peace could be achieved. At this point, the situation should have taken a turn for the better. However, the ten days cannot be said to be too short, but the atmosphere in the capital only lingered in informal individual talks, and even bored to the point of first discussing a publicity truce, without touching on concrete major issues, resulting in wasted time. Even the opportunity for the government and CCP representatives to sit together at the negotiating table and reveal the final card was not created, which is regrettable. According to the news as of yesterday, the government has made extremely great concessions, only hoping that the various parties can present the list of National Assembly representatives, and the government will order a ceasefire. Regarding the other points in the Chairman's statement on the 16th, even after the National Assembly convenes, they can be discussed. The government is willing to continue to make political and military concessions. We believe that all parties should be satisfied, and the situation can take a sharp turn for the better and suddenly see the light. Who would have known that the CCP spokesman again expressed resolute rejection, and some of the so-called "third party" mediators have also left Beijing one after another, although denying the rumors of withdrawing from mediation, and even suggesting a non-official comprehensive forum composed of various parties, but it cannot be denied that the Chinese situation is still stagnating in the "dragging" stage. However, the date for the convening of the National Assembly is only ten days away, and the government's choice of politics for the people does not allow it to lose faith in the people. Dragging it out cannot be prolonged any further! From this tortuous Chinese situation, "talking" may not necessarily lead to success at the moment, but "fighting" may not necessarily lead to a quick victory in the future, and the Chinese situation has indeed entered a stage where a solution must be urgently sought. This is where the "subtlety" of the Chinese situation lies!</p>
<p>To resolve this subtle situation, we have always believed that the government should stand in a proactive position and take responsibility for the country and the people—not only take responsibility for the current situation, but also take historical responsibility. The government should enable the people to at least live and work in peace, and therefore the government must be responsible for truly unifying the country and ensuring lasting peace. If the government can accomplish this task at this time, later historians will give a fair judgment. If the CCP does not understand the responsibility that history has given to the Chinese government at this time and attempts to obstruct the true unification and lasting peace of the country, the people will naturally give a fair judgment. It must be known that China belongs to the Chinese people, and not just to a certain party or faction. At this time, please do not only know that you are the first party, the CCP is the second party, and a certain party or faction is the third, fourth, or fifth party. You must broaden your horizons to see the people of the whole country. No party should boast of being a "party" but should obey the public opinion of the people. We believe that the day the government can recognize the people's wishes and respect the people's power is the day the Chinese situation can move from subtlety to brightness.</p>
<p>The CCP's lack of sincerity in peace talks is not something that started today. The government should not close the door to peace talks because of the CCP's lack of sincerity, but it cannot continue to fall into the abyss of empty talk with those who are insincere! What we would like to point out to the government is that the CCP has no intention of peace, but the representatives of other parties and factions, the elites without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country hope for peace, and are just as eager as the government. The government should grasp this point. At this time, make some major expressions of its own initiative, so that the representatives of various parties and factions, those without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country, and even future generations, can believe that the government truly has the sincerity for peaceful unification. Then the government can be worthy of the country and the people. The excuses that the CCP is currently holding on to are a ceasefire and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). Let us try to borrow a plan for the government: the government can solemnly issue an order to automatically declare a ceasefire in place, as long as the communist troops no longer harass and attack, it will never use military force, and everything will be left for negotiation and resolution; secondly, announce the list of National Assembly members and reorganize the National Government Committee. Both of these should follow the PCC resolutions, reserving the number of participants from all parties in proportion, to await the emergence of representatives from the CCP and other parties. As soon as the representatives are nominated, the National Government can immediately announce it so that everyone can participate in the National Assembly and the National Government Committee. These two measures can be carried out simultaneously. The former can express the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and the latter can express the government's desire to always wait for all parties to jointly participate in the National Assembly and the government to achieve national unification. We believe that if the government is truly sincere and practical, it can not only be understood by the representatives of various parties and factions, the elites without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country, but even if the CCP stubbornly clings to its party's prejudices, it will lose the sympathy of the Chinese people and friendly countries in the world. If the government is so tolerant and the CCP still refuses to participate in the National Assembly, or even obstructs other parties from participating in the National Assembly, then the CCP will eventually abandon itself.</p>
<p>How to dispel the clouds and see the light in the subtle Chinese situation depends on how the government fulfills its responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Uncovers Drug Trafficking Case; Principal Culprit is an Official of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau cracked another drug trafficking case on October 24th, seizing a total of 43 catties and 4 liang of opium and 23.8 million yuan in funds. The main culprits in the case included two incumbent civil servants: Li Jia Chi, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Government and commissioner of the Hebei-Pingjin District Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, and Mao Xing, a staff member of the Potassium Bureau of the Enemy Property Administration. All relevant suspects have been apprehended by the police bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>October 24th was the day for traffic regulation by the 10th Police Sub-bureau. At around 4 p.m., while regulating traffic near Fusun Lane in the Huangjia Garden area under its jurisdiction, the police officers on duty noticed a pedicab speeding by, violating traffic rules. They stopped it for questioning, but the passenger in the pedicab suddenly changed color and appeared flustered. The police officers suspected him and immediately searched him, finding four large packages of opium in his briefcase. After his concealment was exposed, the passenger attempted to bribe the inspecting officers with 10 million yuan, hoping to escape the law. The officers sternly refused and took him to the sub-bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>The suspect confessed that his name was Liu Jincai, and that the opium had been introduced by his friends Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao. He had purchased it from Li Jia Chi's residence for 60,000 yuan per liang, intending to transport it to Shanghai for sale. He had already paid a check for 10 million yuan from the Zhenxingchang Bank and a postal money order for 10 million yuan at Li's residence. Based on Liu's confession, the police bureau immediately arrested all relevant suspects that day: Li Jia Chi, the current commissioner of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau; Mao Xing, a staff member; Sun Zhou Shi, the owner of the opium; Xiao Changyou, Li's servant; Fang Qu Cheng, the accountant; and Zhang Yixing, the introducer. Eight and a half catties of opium and over 2 million yuan in cash were found in Li Jia Chi's residence. Several sets of smoking paraphernalia were found in Sun Zhou Shi's home. Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao escaped and are still at large.</p>
<p>After interrogating the suspects, it was learned that all the drugs belonged to Sun Zhou Shi and were entrusted to Mao Xing for sale by Sun Zhou Shi's nephew. Mao then entrusted them to Li Jia Chi, who instructed his servant Xiao Wei You and accountant Fang Qu Cheng to find a way to sell them. Xiao and Fang then entrusted Zhang Yixing, a tailor, who then introduced Liu Jincai through Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao. According to Sun Zhou Shi, the opium was her late husband's legacy, which she was selling to cover living expenses, and she was not solely engaged in this business.</p>
<p>The police bureau has sealed up the opium and funds totaling 23.8 million yuan and is currently pursuing the fugitives. The entire case will be transferred to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Qidong Residents Endure Calamities; Every Household Hangs Flags to Welcome the National Army; The Market is Depressed; There is a Severe Shortage of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Our Qidong Dispatch] This county, which has been occupied for nine years, was officially recovered at 4 p.m. on the 30th, with the cooperation of Xu Rong, the commander of the National Army's Independent Regiment, and Hu Xiaochun, the county magistrate. The National Army advanced rapidly and did not encounter any resistance. The reporter accompanied the National Army into the county seat, the location of the county government, for the first time and witnessed broken tiles, dilapidated walls, and overgrown weeds. The old county government and public security bureau buildings had been completely destroyed. When the National Army and the county government entered, the residents all stood in front of their doors, cheering from time to time, and every household hung flags. The reporter also learned from conversations with some residents that the Communist army had fled in a hurry to the northeast one hour before the National Army's entry. Before leaving, they had kidnapped more than 20 wealthy shop owners, allegedly because they feared they would welcome the National Army. The Communist army's Huazhong Bank office and the public grain materials they had forcibly requisitioned had all been auctioned off or transported away in the preceding days. The market in the recovered county is still depressed. The most severe shortage at present is legal tender. Many soldiers or civil servants who go to stores to buy goods mostly use cash for purchases, unable to get change. Most of the people seem to be unfamiliar with legal tender. As for the conversion of customs gold units to legal tender, there is even less understanding.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders the Suppression of Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Gongyi believes that labor unrest has occurred frequently in various counties recently, such as the strikes in Wuxi silk factories, which are seriously affecting public order and are undoubtedly instigated by a small number of people. With the National Assembly about to convene and constitutional government soon to be implemented, it is imperative to strictly prevent these incidents to consolidate the situation. He has telegraphed all subordinate special commissioner's offices, instructing them to relay the following three admonitions to all counties, which must be strictly observed: (1) Various illegal organizations must not operate. (2) Labor and management must coordinate and absolutely prohibit shutdowns, slowdowns, strikes, and other events. (3) Any gatherings of the masses or organizations must be approved in advance and must not involve arbitrary marches or petitions. The order also earnestly exhorts local governments to establish sincere connections with local industrial and commercial circles so that the mediation of labor-management disputes can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Construction Funds: Central Government Allocates in Installments</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 1st] Zhejiang Construction Department Director Pi went to Beijing to raise funds for provincial construction. It is now learned that an agreement has been reached and he has arrived in Shanghai. There is no problem with a 1 billion yuan fishing loan. For the other 20 billion yuan for water conservancy, transportation, etc., a temporary approval has been granted to allocate in installments according to the original plan. An emergency fund will be allocated first within the year, followed by another allocation from January to March next year. In June, a further allocation will be made based on actual needs. The ferry across the Qiantang River is currently using old wooden boats transferred from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company which are in disrepair and cannot be used. A decision on improvement measures will be made once the location of the two engines has been determined. Improvement is guaranteed within the year. In Dinghai, the shareholders and supervisors of the official-merchant joint fishing market have been appointed and the market will be established soon.</p>
<h3>The Changing of the Guard for Military Police on the Wuxi-Shanghai Line Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The military police units stationed in the counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai line from Wuxi to Shanghai all completed the replacement of old units with new units on the 1st. The original units of the 15th Military Police Regiment that had been serving were all concentrated in Wuxi for reorganization and training. The unit assigned to take over the new duties is Cai Longren's unit of the 9th Military Police Regiment. It is learned that the regimental headquarters will be set up in Wuxi, the 2nd Battalion will be stationed in Suzhou, and the 5th Battalion will be stationed in Kunshan. Colonel Cai Longren, the regimental commander, will inspect the various garrisons within the next few days. It is reported that special attention will be paid to road protection tasks in the future.</p>
<h3>Land Price Dispute in Suzhou: The Provisional Consultative Council and the Land Registration Office are Deadlocked; The Director of the Construction Department Will Personally Mediate</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] After being assessed by the Land Registration Office, the land prices in this county were ten times higher than the prices approved by the provincial government two months ago and exceeded the market prices. The highest price reached 20 million yuan per mu. Therefore, the Provisional Consultative Council expressed its opposition and repeatedly invited Zhang Zi-, deputy director of the Land Registration Office, and Wu Zhongfan, a commissioner, to hold review meetings, but without results. Moreover, at the second review meeting, the Land Registration Office stated that it had reported to the Provincial Office for approval and could not make changes. Therefore, at the 25th regular meeting on October 23, the Provisional Consultative Council submitted the case to all resident members for joint discussion and resolved to immediately telegraph the Provisional Consultative Councils of the 14 counties in Jiangnan to inquire about the evaluation situation in various places and request them to jointly telegraph the Provincial Government to correct the errors of the Land Registration Office. At the same time, it sent a letter to the County Government instructing the office to immediately stop registration. On the one hand, it also sent a letter to the district offices asking them to inform the town offices to notify residents that they do not need to register within the time limit before the fair price is reassessed. Therefore, the registration work of the Land Registration Office has completely stalled. On the 25th, the Land Registration Office specially sent a letter to the Provisional Consultative Council requesting assistance. However, the Provisional Consultative Council had successively received reply telegrams from the Provisional Consultative Councils of various counties, responding one after another. Therefore, the Provisional Consultative Council has now decided to ignore any future letters from the Land Registration Office. It is reported that Dong Yaozan, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, will come to Suzhou for mediation within the next few days in order to promote land registration work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank of China Issues Low-Interest Grain-Secured Loans in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 1st] The autumn harvest is over, and grain prices are low. Farmers cannot bear the oppression of high-interest loans and are forced to sell new grain at low prices. During the Anti-Japanese War, the countryside was devastated, and farmers suffered the most. Out of compassion, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has consulted with the Central Farmers Bank to issue low-interest loans to secure grain. The method is for the Agricultural Bank to lend to cooperatives and farmers' associations, and indirectly lend to farmers. The maximum loan per household is 100,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 4 percent and an audit fee of 2 to 2.5 percent. All areas with no public security problems, surplus rice, or severe disasters can apply for loans from local Agricultural Bank offices.</p>
<h3>Changshu Recruits: Local Training</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch] Eight hundred new recruits have been conscripted in this county. Some have already reported.

Regarding the barracks problem, it was originally planned to use the Daxing Warehouse outside the South Gate, but it is insufficient. It is said that Xingfu Temple outside the Water Gate will be borrowed.</p>
<h3>Nantong East Township: Reassuring and Relieving Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] In order to ensure the safety of the urban area and escort refugees back to their hometowns, the County Government of this county, in coordination with the county's self-defense teams, has stationed troops in the towns of Jinsha, Shigang, Xiting, and Liuqiao in the eastern part of the county to carry out a comprehensive rehabilitation.

In addition to telegraphed instructions to the cities of Wuhu and Bengbu to speed up the search for a suitable address to set up stations, the Provincial Government Secretariat has found the Victory Hotel inside Xiaodongmen for the Hefei station.

<h3>Xinqiang Oil Mill Robbed</h3>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] At the Xinqiang Yiyi Oil Mill in this county, at around 2 a.m. on the 30th, more than a dozen bandits broke into the mill by digging through the wall, used guns to threaten the workers and prevent them from making a sound, opened the door to let in the bandits, and drove the workers to a room. They then split up and looted the premises, taking away more than 1.6 million yuan in cash and the workers' bedding, clothes, chests, etc., causing considerable losses. After the incident was reported, the local military police pursued the bandits separately, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>

Commissioner Zhang, who was sent to investigate, telegraphed Wuhu to report that, according to preliminary estimates, the equipment in this mine is worth more than 300 billion yuan. A detailed list is being prepared, but there is little coal left. When it was first taken over from the enemy and puppet forces last year, there were more than 10,000 tons of coal in storage.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Appoints Commissioners to Supervise the Collection of Land Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Executive Yuan believes that the land tax for this year has been levied successively. In order to meet the needs of military grain, stabilize the economy, and enrich local financial revenue, it has issued a general order to all provinces, stipulating that at least 80% must be collected by the end of November and all must be cleared by the end of December. The provinces that are levying wheat should complete the task in advance to meet the actual needs of the central government. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially appointed district commissioners to supervise the collection in various counties of the province on the 29th. The first district is Ge Jianshi, including Zhenjiang and nine other counties. The second district is Zan Yao, including Wuxi and other counties. The third district is Ge Jianshi, including Songjiang and nine other counties. The fourth district is Dong Zanyao, including Jiangdu and nine other counties. The fifth district is Wang Gongyu, including Xuzhou City, Donghai, and Tongshan.</p>
<h3>Langxi Daily Published</h3>

<h3>Anhui Northern Flood Area Urgent Relief: The Executive Yuan Allocates 500 Million Yuan and Orders Various Parties to Expedite Handling; Zhejiang Province Expands Winter Relief</h3>

The Executive Yuan has issued an emergency order to allocate 500 million yuan for emergency relief and handed it over to the Anhui Provincial Government for overall planning. Regarding relief materials, farming materials, medical and health care, and water conservancy work relief, they have been handed over to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the National Health Administration, and the Water Conservancy Commission to be processed quickly.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that various counties and cities in the province have been repeatedly hit by natural disasters, with more than 30 counties affected. With the winter season approaching, winter relief should be expanded to benefit the victims. However, all should be based on fundraising in principle and no apportionment should be used. The cities and counties should also establish winter relief committees as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and actively handle them. An order has been issued to all counties and cities to comply.</p>

<p>Be Careful of Pickpockets When Mailing Packages at the Post Office</p>
<p>Last Monday afternoon, the Sichuan Road Post Office was particularly busy, especially the area for mailing large quantities of newspapers, which was crowded with people of all kinds. Pickpockets took advantage of the situation to stir up trouble. Without realizing it, my pen, which I depended on for my livelihood, disappeared. In addition to advising friends who mail packages to be careful, I also hope that the postal authorities can find a better way to prevent the activities of petty thieves and punish them severely! (Reader Shishan)</p>
<p>What About Deposits That Have Not Yet Matured?</p>
<p>The court's fair judgment regarding the repayment of pre-war deposits at 1,000 times their original value is, of course, infinitely appreciated by small pre-war depositors who cannot afford to appeal. However, this only refers to compensation for losses on matured deposits. What about deposits that have not yet matured and will not mature for several years? I am afraid that in this situation of rising prices day and night, there will be no compensation for losses when they mature in the future? Therefore, I hope the financial and judicial authorities will pay attention to this when considering repayment! If it is possible to repay them in advance or have other improved guarantee measures, then law-abiding citizens will share the great benefit. (Jiang Side)</p>
<p>The Price of Monthly Platform Tickets in Taiwan is Too High</p>
<p>There is no reason for the price of platform tickets at railway stations to rise from 300 yuan to 1,000 yuan. When women and children or the elderly get on the train, the railway bureau does not have specialized staff to take care of them, so their relatives and friends must help them, but the railway bureau charges 1,000 yuan for the people helping. This is no different from an excessive tax! If it is to prevent people who buy platform tickets from getting on the train without a ticket, then you can fine passengers without tickets and increase the fine appropriately. (Binggen)</p>
<p>General Response to the Appeals of Soldiers</p>
<p>We recently received a letter from the Ministry of National Defense, No. 35 Quan-Tong-Yi-7, stating: "We have received your letter of August 23 with respect.

We hope to see more in the future, so that we may improve." This is a special reply.</p>
<h3>On Behalf of the Post Office</h3>
<p>To Mr. Chen Tiesheng: We have received a reply from the Shanghai Ferry Company, stating: "We are deeply aware that the roads in the Dongjiadu wharf area are rugged and uneven. When the Tangdong Line was reopened, we first invested more than 100,000 yuan to fill in the low-lying areas near the wharf to maintain traffic. As for further repairs, the project is related to road construction and we have contacted the competent bureau to plan for renovation and construction has already begun." Special reply.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Maogou: Regarding your letter complaining about being insulted for buying flour, we have received a reply from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "After summoning Li Binchang, the owner of the Dongsheng Flour Shop, to the bureau for questioning on the 21st of this month, he stated that he did not assault or insult Zhang Maogou when he bought flour. He is a potsticker shop owner and uses one bag of flour every two days. That day, he requested to buy two bags, but the supply of flour was less than the demand, and there was a verbal conflict. A police officer was present to persuade him to come back tomorrow to buy another bag. He has been instructed to treat customers warmly in the future." Special delivery.</p>

<h3>The General Assembly Stage of the United Nations Ends; Various Committees Begin Work Separately; 55 Items on the Agenda Will Take Four to Five Weeks to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Starting today, the United Nations organization will transition from the General Assembly stage to the stage where various committees work separately. The proposals currently being prepared for discussion include overthrowing the Franco regime in Spain, controlling atomic weapons, universal disarmament, and the implementation of the trusteeship system. In the next four to five weeks, the committees will debate various important issues and then submit reports to the General Assembly. The meeting place has been moved from Flushing to Success Lake, and the facilities are very complete, with sixteen committees meeting simultaneously. The committees holding meetings today include the Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee, the Administrative and Budgetary Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee, and the Trusteeship Committee. The General Assembly's agenda has now increased to 55 items.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela, three Latin American countries, held an important meeting today and unanimously agreed that it is not yet time to recommend that the United Nations sever relations with the Franco regime. It is expected that the Franco issue will be shelved temporarily.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st (Special Telegram)] The Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously agreed this morning to include the following three proposals on the General Assembly's agenda: (1) Disarmament proposal by Soviet Union's Molotov, (2) Joint proposal on the Franco issue (both proposals have been submitted to the Political and Security Committee), and (3) Proposal by the Netherlands on women's political rights (this proposal has been submitted to the Social, Charity, and Cultural Committee). The first and third proposals were passed and included on the General Assembly's agenda without much discussion. However, the Spanish issue, which caused controversy, was hotly debated before a consensus was reached. Currently, the anti-Franco movement is very strong in the General Assembly, and it is expected that the Security Council will remove the Spanish issue from its agenda when it meets on the 4th, allowing the General Assembly to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Our Representative States Our Position: Upholding Justice and Assisting Oppressed Peoples; Fully Endorses Various Suggestions Proposed by the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 31st (Special Telegram)] Zhang Pingqun, the newly appointed chief press secretary of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and the Chinese Consul General in New York, hosted a reception for 20 Chinese reporters at the "Top Good" Hotel in New York today. Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, also attended. Gu said that the Chinese delegation intends to support India's complaint against racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa and intends to recommend that it be discussed publicly in the General Assembly. In addition, the Chinese delegation will also request Western countries to publicly report on the situation of mandated territories since 1919. Gu said that the Chinese delegation is paying close attention to the issue of handing over enemy colonies such as Japan's Pacific islands for trusteeship. The US government is hesitant on this issue, and the US diplomatic and military circles have different opinions. Gu reiterated China's confidence in the United Nations Charter and believes that it is too early to abolish the veto power. When discussing the West-Lia issue, Gu said that the Chinese delegation takes a dismissive and silent attitude towards the Franco regime. Franco has taken a bad attitude towards China since 1931, but China and Spain are far apart and there is not much importance. Gu hopes that an international army commanded by the United Nations can be established in the near future, and China will provide reasonable assistance to small countries and countries controlled by strong powers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st] Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, told the press that China fully endorses the various suggestions made recently by US delegation leader Austin in his speech to the General Assembly. The US delegation has clearly stated its views on the various important issues that the General Assembly should discuss through Senator Austin.</p>
<h3>Indigenous People of French Morocco Live a Slave Life; Appeal to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tangier, 31st] Nasiyani, chairman of the Moroccan Unification Party, telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lai Yi, requesting him to set up a committee to review the Moroccan issue. The telegram pointed out that more than one million Moroccans are living a life of slavery and isolation under the bayonets of the French army.</p>
<h3>South Africa's Indian Problem</h3>
<p>Smuts Requests to Omit from Agenda; US Studies Charter Clause Interpretation</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 31st] South African Prime Minister Smuts, in his address to the UN General Assembly today, argued against including the issue of South Africa's mistreatment of Indians on the agenda. He suggested waiting for the International Court of Justice to clarify the UN Charter's provisions on non-interference in member states' internal affairs before further discussion. It is said that UN interference in member states' internal affairs will ultimately lead to disasters for the UN itself and world peace. Smuts vigorously argued on behalf of South Africa that this explosive political issue should not be placed on the agenda, reiterating South Africa's position that the matter is entirely a domestic affair, with the majority of Indians being South African citizens, not Indian nationals.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 31st] Experts from the US delegation are studying the interpretation of the Charter, a matter arising from India's complaint against South Africa's discrimination against Indians. Article 2, Section 7 of the Charter stipulates that UN organizations have no authority to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any country. However, Article 1, Section 3 states that one of the purposes of UN organizations is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction. These two provisions seem to conflict. Therefore, US experts are currently studying how the word "intervene" in Article 2 should be interpreted and how a domestic minority can bring their grievances to the attention of UN organizations. The United States is deeply aware that the decision made by the UN General Assembly on this matter will have a significant impact on countries with minority populations.</p>

<h3>Churchill's Speech Echoes Austin</h3>

He added that disarmament would not be impossible if the US and the Soviet Union could treat each other frankly. Wallace is supporting the opposing party as a Democrat, but he expressed dissatisfaction with Republican Senator Vandenberg because Vandenberg is of one mind with Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers to Hold a Meeting, Byrnes Issues Warning, Refusing to Participate in Any New Meeting if No Agreement Can Be Reached on the German Question</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 1st] Gandhi, at the age of seventy-seven, caught a cold and cough yesterday and is now feeling unwell. Over the past twenty-eight years, he has fasted nine times, nearly dying twice. Doctors say it is a miracle that he did not die.</p>

<h3>US to Spend $1.4 Billion Building Saipan and Guam Outposts, Existing Equipment Insufficient to Withstand Atomic Warfare</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 1st] The Honolulu "Star-Bulletin" today carried a report from Guam stating that the US Navy will spend $1 billion on Guam and $400 million on Saipan over the next five years to build outposts to defend against attacks from the west. According to Guam Governor Pownall, who spoke to a group of visiting journalists, the majority of the funds will be used to develop Guam's naval base and make Saipan an auxiliary to Guam. He advocated for the US to continue administering the former League of Nations mandated territories in the Pacific and opposed transferring them. All of our financial, human, and material resources are not yet sufficient to establish the defense that we should have. What the US needs is to establish countless interconnected bases like Guam in the Pacific. Our current defense equipment is far from sufficient to cope with atomic bombs and ballistic missile warfare.</p>

<h3>Japanese Invasion of the Pacific Stage Opens in International Court Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Keenan Delivers Long Opening Statement</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 1st] The Far East International Court today entered the stage of trying the Pacific War. Chief Prosecutor Keenan delivered a long opening statement, stating that in 1938, Japan declared the New Order in East Asia, asserting its priority in China. In July 1939, the US notified the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. In July 1941, Tojo initiated and convened an Imperial Conference, deciding that Japan, regardless of the world situation, would establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and unveil the</p>
<p>Southern Advance Policy</p>
<p>At the conference, Matsuoka, Shiratori, and others advocated participating in Germany's war against the Soviet Union before or simultaneously with the occupation of the south. On July 26, President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of Japanese assets, and commerce between Japan and the US, Britain, and the Netherlands was severed. On August 28, Konoe proposed a summit meeting between the heads of the two countries to President Roosevelt, attaching a statement saying: (1) The Japanese government will withdraw troops from Vietnam after the Sino-Japanese Incident is resolved and East Asia becomes independent. (2) The Japanese government declares that its current actions in Vietnam are not a preparatory means for military actions in neighboring areas. On September 3, the President proposed holding preparatory talks; on the 6th, the Japanese ambassador requested the US to cease its military measures in the Far East and Southwest Pacific. On the same day, Tojo and the military convened another</p>
<p>Imperial Conference</p>
<p>Deciding that if the talks could not achieve satisfactory results before mid-October, Japan would implement an attack. After Tojo came to power, the situation quickly turned towards war. The Imperial Conference on November 5 decided to complete preparations after the 25th and simultaneously begin combat operations. On the same day, Joint Fleet Secret Order No. 1 was issued, preparing to attack Pearl Harbor and preparing the Joint Fleet to fight against the US, Britain, and the Netherlands. Two days later, Secret Order No. 2 was issued. On November 10, all Japanese ships were ordered to complete combat preparations before the 20th, and powerful Japanese mobile units were ordered to assemble in the Kuril Islands. On the morning of the 26th of the same month, the order was given to attack Pearl Harbor. The mobile unit moved east at 6 PM, then proceeded south. During this period,</p>
<p>US-Japan Negotiations</p>
<p>continued as a smokescreen for the attack plan. On December 1, the final Imperial Conference was convened, attended by Togo, Tojo, Shimada, Kaya, Suzuki, Nagano, Hoshino, Oka, and Muto. No one expressed opposition to the decision to wage war. The "X" day was decided as December 8, Tokyo time. The cabinet discussed the form of notifying the declaration of war, and the result was to use a written notification of the start of the war. This document was neither a declaration of war nor a final ultimatum, and it was to be delivered one hour after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The issuance and delivery time of this document was Togo's responsibility. On December 6, Togo sent a long cable to Ambassador Nomura, instructing him not to submit it until further instructions were received. On the 7th, instructions were given to submit the telegram at 1 PM Washington time on the 7th. On the evening of the 6th, President Roosevelt cabled the Emperor of Japan personally,</p>
<p>Hoping to Avert a Tragic</p>
<p>Situation. The telegram arrived in Tokyo at noon on the 7th, Tokyo time, but it was not delivered to Ambassador Grew until 10:30 PM. Grew handed it to Togo at 0:05 AM on the 8th, and Togo indicated that he would present it to the Emperor immediately. However, less than an hour later, Japanese invading forces had already begun landing at Singora in northeastern British Malaya. Meanwhile, in Washington, Ambassador Nomura requested a meeting with Secretary of State Hull at 1 PM local time on the 7th, but the meeting did not take place until 40 minutes later. At that time, Pearl Harbor had been under attack for 25 minutes, and the attack on Singora had also begun. The attack on Pearl Harbor was carried out by 360 aircraft launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers anchored 220 nautical miles north of the site.</p>
<p>Sneak Attack on Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>Had a great effect. The US fleet had four battleships sunk and four battleships severely damaged, as well as three cruisers and three destroyers each. Navy officers and men, from Admiral Kimmel down, killed 1,199; Marine Corps deaths totaled 109; civilian deaths totaled 546; 188 aircraft were lost on the ground, and coastal facilities suffered heavy damage. The Japanese lost eight aircraft and five small submarines, with fewer than 100 killed or wounded. An hour later, Nomura handed the aforementioned notification to Hull. At 7 AM, Tokyo time, Japanese radio first broadcast that the battle had begun. At 7:30 AM, Togo invited Grew to meet with him, said that he would meet the Emperor at 3 AM, and handed Grew a copy of the document that Nomura had handed to Hull in Washington, saying that this was the Emperor's reply to President Roosevelt's personal telegram, which was obviously false. At noon on the same day, the Emperor issued an</p>
<p>Edict of War</p>
<p>Tojo then issued a statement, saying that the attack was a means of self-defense. From then on, the Japanese people were driven down the road to war. Hundreds of thousands of houses and millions of lives were sacrificed before the god of war to satisfy the ambitions of the accused. The invasion of the Northeast, the sweep of North China, and the annexation of all of China were all studied, planned, and acted upon by these defendants. The broad strategic goal of the accused was to annex all of China, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] The indictment of the Japanese defendants by the Tokyo International Court is nearing completion, and the defense side will soon begin its arguments. The defense side plans for the trial to be extended until mid-June next year. Defense lawyers have requested the court to hold general and sectional debates, as well as final individual defenses for each defendant. If each defendant and his witnesses take up one week, then the 27 defendants will require 27 weeks. When the debates will begin will be decided within a few days.</p>

<h3>Crash Outside Zhenru Station, Ten-Wheel Truck Shattered and Caught Fire, Train Engine Also Damaged, Fortunately No Casualties on Both Sides, Beijing-Shanghai Train Delayed for One and a Half Hours</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, another collision between a train and a ten-wheel truck occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai line outside Zhenru Station. Fortunately, the train driver noticed it early, and the truck driver also managed to escape in time, so there were no casualties. The Beijing-Shanghai train was delayed for one and a half hours as a result. After the accident, Deputy Director Hou of the Bureau, along with Deputy Directors of the Transportation Department Guan Duo and Wu Yukun, Transportation Section Chief Zhou Weidong, and Shanghai-Wuxi Section Chief Ouyang Qiu, led a team on a rescue vehicle to repair the line. Traffic was not restored until 1 PM. A reporter from the East China News Agency investigated the details as follows: The Beijing-Shanghai Train No. 8 departed from Shanghai North Station at 11 AM yesterday and arrived at Zhenru Station at 11:14 AM. The public road due north outside the station boundary was already damaged and marked as closed to traffic. Unexpectedly, a ten-wheel truck from the First Equipment Road Construction Corps of the Ministry of Transportation was driving south from the north. When it reached the railroad crossing, it suddenly stopped moving forward. At that time, Train No. 8 was approaching. The truck driver, Lang Changqing, upon seeing this, immediately abandoned the vehicle and fled. By the time the train driver noticed, he immediately applied the brakes, but it was too late, resulting in a violent collision with the truck. With a loud crash, the truck was thrown several zhang away into a small ditch and immediately caught fire. The train engine was also damaged. After the accident, the Zhenru Station Master urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Administration for help. Train No. 8 returned to Zhenru Station at 11:45 AM and switched to another engine. The line was not cleared and reopened until 1 PM. The truck driver, Lang Changqing, was immediately apprehended by personnel dispatched by the Police Department of the Railway Bureau. According to his confession, the truck was transporting workers from the Road Construction Corps back to their dormitory. Due to a momentary desire for convenience, he took a shortcut, resulting in this disaster. He was then transferred by the Police Department to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Lottery Held Yesterday for Eliminating Rickshaws, "Four" Drawn</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities, in compliance with central government orders, held a public lottery to eliminate rickshaws in the city at 1 PM on the 1st in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than 40 people attended, including responsible persons from various bureaus and representatives from the Rickshaw Business Association and the Labor Union. Deputy Director Zhang Rentao of the Public Utilities Bureau presided over the meeting and outlined the process of implementing the elimination of rickshaws in the city, stating that the elimination would begin this winter and be completed within two years, as stipulated by the central government. There are a total of 20,582 licensed rickshaws and 6,308 private rickshaws in the city. Currently, one-tenth, approximately 2,000, will be eliminated using a lottery system with ten numbers (1 to 0). The number drawn will determine which rickshaws are eliminated, with any rickshaw whose license number ends in the drawn number being subject to elimination.</p>
<p>Rickshaws that are the sole property of their owners will not be eliminated this winter to show compassion. However, this does not apply to owners who apply to transfer the rickshaw after the authorities announced the implementation measures two days before the deadline for transferring ownership. For rickshaws selected for elimination, licensed rickshaw companies must surrender their licenses to the Public Utilities Bureau Registration Office before December of this year, and private rickshaw owners must also surrender their licenses to the Public Utilities Bureau Registration Office. If the licenses are not returned, the police will prohibit their use starting January 1st of next year. After the chairman finished his report, to ensure fairness, he had ten bamboo slips, each marked with a number, inspected by representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Rickshaw Labor Union, and then placed in a round paper tube covered with a white cloth. Zhou Lianze, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, drew a slip and immediately drew the slip with the number "four". This is the last digit of the license number of the rickshaws to be eliminated this winter. By the end of December, all rickshaws with a license number ending in "four" must be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Students Returned from America, Mayor Wu Expresses Views, Should Have Selfless Spirit</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday at noon, the Association of Students Returned from America held a gathering at the Great Eastern Restaurant. Mayor Wu was invited to attend and expressed his views on university education, stating:</p>
<p>The purpose of education is to increase knowledge. University education is to teach a person to be more like a "human" and more different from "beasts."</p>
<p>Former US Ambassador to China Hurley said, "Generalissimo Chiang is great." Hurley is a person with no prejudice. Why did he admire Chairman Chiang? He said, "Because he has a 'selfless spirit.'" Therefore, all people should forget themselves. Think more about others and less about themselves.</p>
<p>Currently, the citizens living in Shanghai inevitably have many dissatisfactions with Shanghai, such as high prices and social instability. Therefore, the most important measure for rectifying Shanghai is to suppress prices. However, to suppress prices, it is necessary to facilitate transportation. To facilitate transportation, it is necessary to stop the civil war. Everyone present is a student returned from America, and I believe you will contribute good ideas, and I will humbly accept them.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Transfer Passenger Ships to Operate on North and South China Sea Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the operation of the Zhonglian Company's Hualian ship on the Shanghai-Tianjin route in the Bohai Sea, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is also planning to add passenger ships to the route. However, apart from the Yangtze River ships, which are passenger ships, the rest of the company's ocean-going ships are cargo ships. Therefore, the company is planning to purchase passenger ships. To meet the current urgent needs, it is planned to transfer the Jiangya and Jiangjing ships from the Ningbo route to operate on the North and South China Sea routes. The Jiangjing ship was recently dispatched to Hankou to transport National Assembly representatives to Beijing. The Jiangya ship will continue to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route for the time being. When the transfer is implemented, the Jiangjian ship will be transferred to the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

<h3>A Group of Wanderers: Presenting Flags and Paying Respects to Relevant Authorities in Different Directions. Eight Hundred Refugee Children Are No Longer What They Used to Be</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, refugee children from the Shanghai Relief Institute's Refugee and Orphanage Reception Center set off from Caohejing to present flags and pay respects to various relevant authorities in the city. The large procession consisted of 800 children, led by the director of the center, Zhou Zuwang, on foot. A large banner reading "We Were Originally a Group of Wanderers" led the way, which was quite thought-provoking. Following was a military band, which played exceptionally well. The marching ranks were orderly and full of energy, quite unlike wanderers. The group arrived at the Shanghai branch of the Youth League at 1:00 PM to present a flag. The head of the league, Wu Shaoshu, personally received them. After the flag presentation, Wu gave a speech, saying: "You were once wandering children on the streets, but now you are the backbone of the nation. I hope that those of you who are determined to serve the country will join the Youth League. I welcome you very much." Afterwards, they performed drills in the Youth League square. Their marching was orderly and their spirits were high, which was commendable.</p>
<p>Then, they presented a flag to the Bureau of Social Affairs, arriving at 2:30 PM. As Director Wu Kaixian was away on business, a representative accepted the flag on his behalf. The flag was inscribed with the four characters "Xu Ku Chui Sheng" (breathing life into the withered), which had a profound meaning. At 3:30 PM, they arrived at the Municipal Council to present a flag to Speaker Pan. The secretariat received them, gave them a short rest, and distributed bread and tea. Speaker Pan arrived in person and, together with all the members of the Works and Police Committees who were holding a meeting at the council yesterday, received the flag amidst the sound of military music. The flag was inscribed with the four characters "He Fu Meng Ze" (crucian carp receiving rain). After receiving the flag, the group proceeded to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu. After Mayor Wu received the flag and saw the four characters "Tui Shi Jie Yi" (sharing food and clothing), he was deeply moved. He summoned them for a speech, speaking through tears. He said: "I am very grateful to you, but I am even more saddened, because I am so touched by you. In my position as mayor, I should help you and raise you. But in the past you were wandering on the streets, and this is our fault, it is because we are not doing our jobs well. I cannot blame you. I am really sorry to you. In the future, I will do my best to reduce the number of wanderers on the streets and fulfill our responsibilities." After finishing his speech, he instructed the leader of the group, Zhou Zuwang, to take good care of them on their way back. The refugee children then lined up and left the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Impressions of National Assembly Representative from Fujian, Zhan Diaoyuan: An Old Man at the Jinmen Hotel, Enduring a Long Journey While Caring for National Affairs</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Zhan Diaoyuan, a 77-year-old National Assembly representative from Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Xiamen the day before yesterday and is now staying in a modern room on the third floor of the Jinmen Hotel. He is wearing a blue cloth robe and a small melon-shaped hat. He is missing two front teeth. His gray beard is neither long nor short and hangs down in front of his chest. His temples are also gray. What interested me the most was the shiny water pipe in his hand. I remember seeing this kind of smoking device commonly used by my grandparents in my rural life as a child. Now, more than ten years later, I saw this old object again on the third floor of one of the most modern hotels in this bustling city. As I faced this figure that seemed like he was from my grandfather's generation, despite the noisy sounds of cars, horses, and pedestrians coming from Nanjing Road outside the window, I could not help but indulge in a nostalgic mood.</p>
<p>Another National Assembly representative, Mr. Yang Fengnian, who introduced me to the reporter, was once the brigade commander of the 49th Division of the Army around 1926 and is now the speaker of the Zhangzhou Municipal Council. He broke my reverie and said, "What is most commendable this time is Mr. Zhan. We all advised him not to come, but he is very enthusiastic about national affairs and insisted on participating."</p>
<p>Indeed, in the eyes of this 77-year-old man, there was still a spark of passion. Although his voice had become very low and short, I could believe that he still retained the heart of a middle-aged man, at least in spirit. When I asked him if the journey was tiring, he said that the plane was as stable as a car. And after arriving in Shanghai, he even walked to the Daxin Company for sightseeing in the morning.</p>
<p>He took a few puffs from his water pipe, stood up, thought for a moment, and walked a few steps. He said to me excitedly, "Originally, a person of my age would not need to travel so far. But this National Assembly is too important for the country. We have been talking about constitutionalism since the time of Yuan Shikai in 1913. It has been more than thirty years, and we still haven't drafted a constitution!"</p>
<p>Regarding the constitution, he supports the "May 5th Draft Constitution." At this National Assembly, he said that he plans to propose a motion to accelerate the implementation of local autonomy. "Only locally elected officials will not engage in corrupt behavior." This is a common belief that he and Mr. Yang expressed in unison.</p>
<p>When talking about events from decades ago, Mr. Zhan became even more energetic. He said that in the year of the Xinhai Revolution (1911), he planned the restoration of three prefectures in Fujian. His comrades carried copper gongs and shouted on the streets. "Thirty-five years!" He sighed with endless emotion. Finally, he suddenly laughed and said, "When I joined the Kuomintang, you didn't even know where you were!"</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to this old revolutionary and walking out of the Jinmen Hotel, a complex emotion welled up in my heart. I thought of the suffering of China and the old representatives... all of this gave us too many feelings.</p>

<h3>Terminal's Condition Worsens</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The condition of Terminal, former advisor to Chairman Chiang, has worsened recently. Yesterday, our reporter drove to Hong En Hospital to visit him, but as visiting hours were over and the doctor had ordered him to rest, we were unable to see him. According to his nurse, Terminal's condition is indeed more serious than in the summer, but still better than when he first arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that Terminal was imprisoned by the Japanese in Manila for three years during the occupation, which caused him to develop lung cancer. He came to Shanghai for treatment after the victory, and his condition improved somewhat. Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang personally visited him during their recent visit to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Two Witnesses in Sun Tianchang's Case of Aiding the Enemy Also Suspected of Crimes: Hu Chengeng and Xu Tianxi Indicted by the Commercial Inspection Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Hu Chengeng, the former foreman who stood up and testified to the investigating team in the case of Sun Tianchang, a Korean man who aided the enemy with military supplies, and Xu Tianxi, the accountant of the Shanghai Precision Machinery Factory, were summoned and detained by the High Prosecutor's Office a month ago when the Sun case was at its height. After more than a month of investigation, it was determined that Hu Chengeng and others were engaged in the manufacture of military supplies in Sun Tianchang's factory, violating Article 1, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. On October 23, Prosecutor Tian Linhouqi filed a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>High Court Continues Trial of Zhao Zunyue: Testimony of Six Witnesses Favorable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zunyue, who served as the puppet propaganda minister, deputy secretary-general of the puppet Central Political Council, secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, and deputy minister of the puppet Ministry of Railways, was retried by the High Court yesterday afternoon. Many witnesses were questioned, and their testimony was favorable to the defendant. Zhao himself also gave a defense. After the evidence was investigated in court, the case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was still detained in the Zhongjian Prison.</p>
<p>The six witnesses who were called yesterday testified as follows: (1) Qi Zaizhi stated: "It is true that the defendant protected the radio station, provided funds, and established contact with the central government. And the defendant helped rescue me three times when I was arrested four times." (2) Zhou Shaowen, principal of Lequn Middle School and director of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League, stated: "I was arrested by the enemy's military police on December 15, 1943, along with more than forty people. The defendant rescued me." (3) Yang Jiren (Yang Siyi), a major general member of the Central Training Corps and former senior counselor of the Third War Zone, stated: "I was assigned by the commander to carry out counter-espionage work. The defendant introduced me to Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai." (4) Yao Jilang, principal of the Municipal Wuben Elementary School, stated: "I was arrested twice, and the defendant rescued me both times. The fact that Wuben Elementary School was changed from a municipal school to a private school and was not taken over by the enemy was also due to the defendant's protection." (5) Zhao Qihua, a Western doctor, stated: "At that time, I was treating Jiang Bocheng. Jiang was monitored by the enemy's military police, so I informed the defendant and asked him to find a way to improve the situation." (6) Luo Bao, a member of the Counter-Espionage Committee, testified that the defendant established a radio station to contact the central government, and that the defendant's appointment as secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government was at the suggestion of the Counter-Espionage Committee to facilitate counter-espionage work, which was also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>(Additional report) Huang Heting, a rice merchant, was accused of serving as the head of the first township (later changed to the first joint protection) of the puppet Shanghai Zhabei district. After investigation yesterday, the case was also adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Investigates Field Taxes: Property Owners Can Register</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Because the field tax registers of the municipal government have been inaccurate for many years, the Finance Bureau has dispatched staff to the four rural areas starting on the 26th of last month to gather property owners to conduct on-site investigations in order to ensure that the grain registers match the names of the property owners. Property owners in the urban area who find it inconvenient to travel back and forth can register at the Tianfu Section of the Finance Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Registration Required by End of Year for Custody or Use of Public Land</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At the 53rd municipal conference held yesterday morning, two proposals related to land registration were approved. One is that public land held or used by various agencies should be registered by the original custodial agency or the using agency with the Land Administration Bureau. Public land held or used by various agencies in the city that has not yet been registered should be registered with the Land Administration Bureau before the end of this December. Public land that has not been registered after the deadline will be taken over by the Land Administration Bureau in accordance with the law. The other is that the land rights of non-treaty foreigners and stateless foreigners in the six land registration areas of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Wusong, Fahua, and Yinxiang should also be registered with the Land Administration Bureau before December 31 of this year for processing. Those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will be considered ownerless land.</p>
<h3>Several Chinese Merchant Warehouses Close Down: Business Difficulties, Two Reasons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Enemy Property Management Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs to handle the various enemy and puppet materials stored in the city's warehouses for several months. As a result, 70% to 80% of the materials have been cleared, and the congestion in the warehouses has been greatly improved. However, the business situation of the public merchant warehouse industry has fallen into a state of recession. Several businesses have closed down in October.</p>
<p>The reasons for the business difficulties of Chinese merchant warehouses are that they are difficult to compete with foreign merchants in terms of equipment and scope, and that there is also intense competition within the industry. Among them, the warehouses established by silver and money shops operating pawn shops have formed their own system and have not joined the guild. These warehouses have interest income to subsidize them, so their fees are half the price of ordinary warehouses, only 80 yuan per cubic meter per month, while ordinary warehouses charge 160 yuan. Therefore, customers naturally tend to choose the former and can obtain the convenience of pawn loans. In fact, according to people in the ordinary warehouse industry, a fee of 160 yuan per cubic meter is at risk of loss under rising prices. Another phenomenon is that although the warehouses that previously stored enemy and puppet materials have now been cleared, the losses over the past year have been considerable. Although the Enemy Property Management Bureau also provided rent during the period, it was far from the market price. Before June, only 15 yuan per cubic meter per month was given, and from June onwards, it only increased to 25 yuan. Now that the materials have been cleared, it is difficult to find customers for the time being, so many businesses have closed down.</p>

<h3>Holding Crabs and Drinking Wine is a Timely Pleasure: A Misstep Becomes Eternal Regret</h3>

<h3>Court Police Arrest Suspect: Woman Falsely Reports Robbery</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A man named Gu Laoqi was recently reported to have served as a "hugging foot" in gambling dens, extensively recruiting disciples, and committing illegal acts under the guise of the enemy's power. After the High Prosecutor's Office accepted the case, it dispatched judicial police officers Wang Junhua and Ni Zixiang to arrest him at his wives' residences yesterday morning. His concubine, Gu Yexiuqing, lived at 17 Nanhua New Village, Pushi Road. Three court police officers went to the address and were met by Gu Yexiuqing, who replied that Gu Laoqi was not there. She claimed that she had a brother in the Military Intelligence Bureau and wanted to talk to them, asking them to wait. After speaking, she turned around and went outside to call the Changshu Road Police Station, reporting that there were robbers. The police station, because the location of the incident was not within its jurisdiction, relayed the message to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched 30 to 40 officers, fully armed, to the address to apprehend the suspects. When they arrived at the destination, the court police officers realized that it was a misunderstanding and immediately stepped forward to explain the reason. Gu Yexiuqing was taken back to the police station by the police officers, and the three court police officers followed along. After the High Prosecutor's Office learned of the situation, it immediately sent a letter to the police station, and the three court police officers were released. Gu Yexiuqing was taken to the High Prosecutor's Office by the court police officers for reprimand for intentionally making a false report. However, Gu Laoqi has still not been apprehended.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Having read the news in your newspaper on the 1st of this month regarding the case of corruption in receiving materials on Yanping Road, involving me. After investigating, the case was reported to the former Military Receiving Committee, which dispatched Wang Zenglue, a staff member of the material expenditure group, along with the original informant, to investigate the receiving, which was in progress. Suddenly, Qu Lianfu, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and Shen Wenyuan came forward, stating that the materials had been sealed by the Municipal Government beforehand, requesting a halt to the receiving, and claiming that official documents were being drafted. Since Secretary Qu represented the Municipal Government's participation in the Receiving Committee's work, it was agreed to temporarily suspend the transport for further processing. Subsequently, an official letter was received from the Municipal Government requesting a halt to the receiving, which was reported and handled accordingly, and the original informant was informed. Later, the Receiving Committee was ordered to dissolve, and the entire file was transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for handling. The portion of materials already received and stored in the Albert Road warehouse was also transferred to the Jianghai Customs for inventory. The entire process of the case, the handling bureau has files to review. When I was handling the case, I acted based on facts and did not harbor any preconceived notions. The information in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I fear there may be misunderstandings, so I am writing to request a correction. Hoping for publication. Lu Shishang</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Warns Oil Merchants: No Excuses to Create Black Markets; Those Hoarding Raw Materials Will Be Forced to Have Other Factories Produce</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Mayor Wu convened a meeting at the Municipal Government with representatives from China Vegetable Oil Factory, China Edible Oil Company, the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Industry Association, the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Retailers Association, as well as Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the causes of the recent fluctuations in cooking oil prices and the crux of the matter. Subsequently, a representative from the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Industry Association stated that rising oil prices were due to insufficient electricity supply affecting production. Mayor Wu expressed great dissatisfaction with this explanation, as a thorough prior investigation showed that except for the Zhongzhi Oil Factory, which requires more electricity, the remaining oil factories generally require less electricity, so supply is not a problem. Therefore, their production should not be reduced due to electricity. The reasons for oil price fluctuations are nothing more than (1) oil merchants fueling speculation and manipulating the market, and (2) oil factories hoarding raw materials and taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, Mayor Wu issued a warning, advising oil merchants not to make unfounded speculations and create black markets. For the second point, if raw materials are owned but not used for production, they can be entrusted to other factories for production, otherwise strict measures will be taken. It was also decided to summon Cao Xingeng, director of the Oil Pressing Industry Association, at 11:00 AM today to thoroughly inquire and clarify the truth. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed satisfaction with the joint distribution of edible oil by Zhongzhi and Zhongshi and announced on the spot that in order to strengthen Zhongzhi's production, the factory's weekly power outage on Fridays could be lifted.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stagnant, Oil Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>The rice market registered over 16,000 shi of customers and goods, but digestion was slow. White japonica rice was sluggish, and indica rice also saw little trading. Medium-quality grades saw slight price reductions. White yuan and yin yuan were oversupplied, falling 21,000 yuan. Soybean oil mills saw improved intake. Northeast soybeans were slow to move in various ports, remaining flat. Central Plains soybeans saw a 1,000 yuan increase. Soybean cakes saw strong demand in Shantou, with prices rising 300-400 yuan. Wheat bran was firm at 100 yuan. The oil market saw increased factory supply, while stores turned to observation. Raw oil plunged 5,000-6,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil were flat. Clear oil was uncertain. Sesame oil was depressed. Raw peanuts saw halted sales outside the port, with prices falling 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold and Currency Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the Central Bank's control, smelted gold showed some stability. It opened at 2,348,000 to 2,353,000, but then declined slightly, gradually falling with frequent pressure. Buying interest was suppressed. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 60 bars at a price of 2,327,500. After that, there was no strength to recover. Near noon, the market dropped to 2,323,000 before stabilizing. At noon, it hovered around 2,330,000. The afternoon was relatively stable, still able to rise above 2,340,000. As a result, it recovered a small 8,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold and silver remained unchanged. Silver dollars rose to around 2,000 yuan. Private short-term lending was flat, with private interest rates at around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency conditions eased slightly. In the unofficial market, US dollars initially quoted at 4,180 yuan for selling and 4,130 yuan for buying. At noon, it fell slightly to between 4,120 yuan and 4,170 yuan, and finally dropped below 4,150 yuan, resulting in a slightly lower closing than the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were relatively stable, but buying interest was slightly weaker, with little change in results. Hong Kong remittances were limited to actual sales, at 895 yuan. Indian remittances were at 1,090 yuan, and British remittances were around 14,300 yuan, with little trading. The official US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged, with no trading.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Government bonds continued to decline yesterday under concentrated liquidation by scattered sellers. Series C opened at 1,850 yuan, with selling prices starting at 1,880 yuan. Buyers took a wait-and-see approach, and sellers prevailed, gradually falling to below 1,750 yuan at the close, resulting in a further decline of 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were flat, Series D fell slightly by 20 yuan, and Series E fell by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Market More Relaxed at the End of Last Month</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to financial circles, the allocation of funds at the end of last month was not as tight as in previous months. The stability of the money market was unprecedented. This is because before the implementation of the Treasury Law by the Changju Bureau, various sectors often accumulated payments for materials distributed by state-owned enterprises and taxes due to tax authorities until the end of each month. Financial institutions are also required to close their accounts at the end of each month. Under this dual pressure, the money market often tightened at the end of each month. Now that government funds must be concentrated and paid into the national treasury and must be paid at any time without delay or accumulation, it is estimated that the pressure on the money market at the end of each month will be reduced considerably in the future.</p>
<h3>Soap Subject to Commodity Tax; Chamber of Commerce Cables for Exemption</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The City Chamber of Commerce notes that the current Commodity Tax Regulations, Article 3, Category 13, which includes cosmetics, lists 14 items, and soap is one of the 14 items. However, soap is only used for washing the body and has the same nature as toothpaste and tooth powder for cleansing, and does not contain any aesthetic or decorative meaning, which is completely different from snow cream, lipstick, perfume, rouge, and other items. Currently, when the Legislative Yuan formulated the Commodity Tax Regulations, toothpaste and tooth powder were not included in cosmetics for commodity tax collection, so it is reasonable to make an exception for soap. A telegram has been sent to the Legislative Yuan proposing an amendment.</p>
<h3>Silk Suddenly Out of Stock; Next Month's Futures All Sold Out</h3>

The price of 80-double-strand silk has reached 420,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Issuing Sun Yat-sen Currency Denied by Finance Minister Yu</h3>

<h3>Spinning Mills Have Additional Output; Yarn Prices Fall by Over 100,000; Fangjian Cloth and Linbu are Sold Off at a Loss; Cotton Spinning Industry Association Maintains Contracts</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a general meeting of all members at the association's headquarters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than 30 representatives from various member companies attended. Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. The four key points provided by the Textile Management Committee the other day were discussed separately. Regarding the first point, the representatives believed that it was inappropriate to make changes to already established contracts, such as making adjustments for overpayment or underpayment, in commercial practice. Therefore, it was decided to ask Mr. Wang Qiyu and several representatives to personally explain the difficulties to Chairman Wu next Monday. Regarding the second, third, and fourth points, the representatives all believed that they could be followed. Regarding the Textile Management Committee's proposal to provide price negotiation forms, the representatives believed that since the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association has a price negotiation committee, it is hoped that the price negotiation steps can still be determined by the price negotiation committee, submitted to the Textile Management Committee for approval, and then notified to each factory by the price negotiation committee for compliance. The representatives all expressed satisfaction with the proposal to increase the amount of yarn and cloth transported to the South. Chairman Wu decided to fully simplify the application procedures for the factories to transport yarn and cloth to the South, so that the city's yarn and cloth can be transported to the South as soon as possible to relieve the panic of yarn and cloth in South China.</p>
<p>Also, the yarn allocated by the spinning mills in this port on the 26th of last month, totaling 12,000 pieces, has been allocated to practical users by the six associations, including the Yetian Dyeing and Weaving Industry. Currently, customers have prepared the full amount in accordance with the three-day provision in the yarn allocation reservation form. Up to today, they are exchanging warehouse receipts for the allocated yarn at the spinning mills, and the clearance is proceeding smoothly. Yesterday, various spinning mills produced additional cotton yarn to help suppress the market conditions. Yong'an Spinning Mill produced 450 pieces, China Textile Spinning Mill produced 828 pieces, Rongfeng Spinning Mill produced 400 pieces, and Hengda Spinning Mill produced 90 pieces. It is said that Shenxin Textile Company will also produce yarn today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn prices declined on the market. Because the cotton yarn distributed by the Joint Distribution Association this time was re-allocated by the direct production complex industry association, coupled with the excessive cost of capital, they were competing to sell in the market. The price of each count of yarn fell by 150,000 to 250,000. In addition, Yong'an and other spinning mills had additional allocations, so buyers were sufficient and transactions were scarce. 20-count double yarn fell below the 2 million mark, 42-count fell to 3.4 million yuan, and 32-count was quoted at 2.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth prices are deteriorating downstream. There is more selling than buying in the market. The goods released by Fangjian the day before yesterday were even sold off at a loss. The popular No. 190 Indanthrene also plummeted. Chick Brand Shilin fell to 120,000 yuan, and Mainland Shilin was only selling for 118,000 yuan. Although dye prices have not fallen, colored cloth has declined sharply. Due to weak sales, the fabric intake of various dyeing factories is also stagnant. Longtou fine cloth is 83,000 yuan, middle-grade Yulong fine cloth fell to 70,000 yuan, and low-grade Changzhou goods are only quoted at 60,000 yuan, with no buyers.</p>
<h3>Bearish Sentiment Rampant; Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks showed bearish signs yesterday. With the news of the deadline for paying yarn and cloth settlement funds spreading, buyers were hesitant. In the morning, under the eagerness of brokers, Yongsha勉强成交 at 690 yuan, but then it was sold off aggressively. Xinnuo fell sharply. After the opening, there was a sound of selling, and each stock fell sharply without much support. The supply side succumbed to the pressure of the bear market and was unable to rise. Those closing overnight positions, such as No. 164, closed their positions one after another. Yongsha fell to the edge of the 660 yuan mark, and Meiya even broke the 3,000 yuan mark. However, at this time, Nos. 176 and 232 entered at low prices, and No. 89 and others also covered short positions. There were frequent fluctuations after the decline, but the overall situation was unfavorable, and it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. In the afternoon, the results of the popular stocks, including Yongsha, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu, all fell by about half a percent. Xinguang fell by 4%, and Qinxing fell by 6%. Among the cold stocks, Lianan was flat, and the rest fell slightly. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon. Before long, there were sales at high prices, and the table gang and scattered short sellers were almost unanimous in their short selling activities. It gradually fell back to the morning and noon low prices, and then hovered slightly. As a result, compared with the previous close, the popular stocks, including Yongsha, Xinguang, and Qinxing, fell by 4%, and Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu fell by half a percent. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang, Zhongsheng, Xinya, Lianan, and Huafeng were flat, and the rest fell slightly to half a percent. Most of the stocks outside the market fell.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to rise at the opening, but it was still difficult to maintain after the high. The securities gang sold off at high prices and turned slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Federation Paper, and Asian Steel all fell sharply. Yipi and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent. Yeguang was flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rationing Commences on the 7th of This Month; One Jin Per Person Per Month</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the black market for sugar, the Municipal Government will implement a sugar rationing plan. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation have drafted the regulations and set the implementation date for this month. It is understood that the sugar purchase certificates for citizens have been distributed by the Civil Affairs Department to the districts, neighborhoods, and households. Sales will begin simultaneously at all Southern Goods Stores on the 7th of this month. According to the investigation by the Civil Affairs Department, there are 3.6 million citizens in this city. 3.6 million sugar purchase certificates have been issued, stipulating that each person can purchase one jin of sugar per month, totaling 3.6 million jin, for a total allocation of 20,000 bags (180 jin per bag). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation has prepared everything. On the 4th of this month, the Southern Goods Stores will pay the money and pick up the goods. Sales will begin on the 7th. Regarding prices, the Sugar Review Committee has decided that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will sell to the Southern Goods Stores at 800 yuan per jin, and the Southern Goods Stores will sell to the citizens at 1,000 yuan per jin. The Southern Goods Stores will have a profit of 200 yuan per jin. If the neighborhood or household leaders withhold the certificates, or the Southern Goods Stores raise prices, citizens can report them. After selling the sugar, the Southern Goods Stores will submit the citizens' sugar purchase (blank) to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for settlement. If there is a surplus, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can recover the sugar at the original price. If the Southern Goods Stores do not want to return the goods, they will pay an additional 500 yuan to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation at a limit price of 1,300 yuan per jin.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Recovers</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 31st] The cotton market was very active this morning, and cotton prices soared, reaching the maximum limit of ten points. There were few sellers, which was a novelty in the last two weeks. Apparently, someone is willing to pay high prices to buy large quantities of cotton. Distant months rose sharply, closing up 4.75 to ten points from the previous day.</p>
<p>[United Press New Orleans 31st] Today, cotton prices rose to the ten-point limit due to large-scale purchases by spinning mills.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Loan Handled by China Communications Bank; Equipment as Collateral Not Likely</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silk weaving industry's application for a loan has been approved by the Four Joint Offices and issued five loan measures. The industry association is now investigating the status of its members and the amount of loans applied for, which will be completed soon and submitted for approval. At 3:00 PM on the 31st, the industry specifically sent Standing Director Liu Qingyi, Cai Xintao, and Chief Secretary Zhang Shouyu to the Central Bank to request two points regarding the loan: (1) Silk weaving factories with ten or more sets of motors plan to pledge 30% of the equipment, and (2) small factories with less than ten machines plan to have the Silk Industry Bank provide loans, which will then be re-mortgaged to the Central Bank. The Business Bureau instructed that loan collateral should be discussed with the China Communications Bank and handled in accordance with the measures promulgated by the Four Joint Offices. As for loans to small silk weaving factories, they can be handled by local lending syndicates in accordance with the small factory loan measures. Subsequently, the China Communications Bank stated that the silk weaving industry's request to pledge 30% of the equipment was unnecessary because the raw materials and finished products were sufficient for collateral. The detailed loan measures will be decided after a subcommittee meeting.</p>

The referee will be Zhang Zhiren, and the linesmen will be Zhu [missing character] and Wang Chongye. Tickets are uniformly priced at two thousand yuan. Although Longjie team, after being promoted to Group A this year, suffered an initial setback against Donghua, the threat it posed to the opponent shows that its strength is by no means ordinary. The hope of victory is extremely high in today's match against the British Navy. The British Navy has not been in Shanghai for long and performed in the birthday celebration exhibition match. Although it did not live up to expectations, unfamiliarity with the place and the fatigue of the journey also had an impact.

<h3>A Hard-working Deaf Student: Zu Zhengang Goes to the United States for Further Study, Bidding Farewell to Deaf Compatriots Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Deaf student Zu Zhengang, limited by his physical defects, was unable to pursue further studies in the country. Deeply resentful, he struggled to become self-reliant and eventually became a standing director of the Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute and worked in the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Recently, the New York School for the Deaf and Mute in the United States sent a telegram specially authorizing him to enroll for further studies, and our Ministry of Education also allocated US$1,000 to subsidize his tuition. It is reported that Zu Zhengang is preparing to go abroad and yesterday published a "Farewell Letter to Deaf Compatriots," the original text of which is as follows: "Dear deaf and mute compatriots: I am now speaking as a deaf and mute compatriot and a standing director of the Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute. I sincerely hope that we will truly understand the suffering of our deaf and mute compatriots in China in terms of life and career. Therefore, our more than four million deaf and mute compatriots must understand and respect each other, and jointly assume responsibility and work hard to seek happiness for the deaf and mute masses, so as to easily gain the sympathy and attention of enlightened people in general society, so that we can enjoy freedom and rights equally with ordinary people. This is indeed our unanimous appeal and demand.</p>
<p>Not Allowed to Enroll</p>
<p>The problems of deaf and mute compatriots seeking education and employment in the country are very serious, and marriage is even more difficult, resulting in losses to the country and society. Because I once asked the educational authorities for the opportunity to enroll during the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Chen Lifu once approved a loan and allowed me to study at the National Art College and the National Ninth Middle School, but the principals of these schools did not accept me as a student. Their reason was that they believed that deaf and mute people are not healthy and cannot be taught. Therefore, I made the greatest determination to dedicate myself to the welfare of the deaf and mute. My hope is that the deaf and mute in our country will have more opportunities for education and employment every day, so that we can have the opportunity to obtain freedom and happiness in the future.</p>
<p>Special Permission to Study Abroad</p>
<p>I have been working in the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs since 1942, and it has been four and a half years now. In January of this year, I received special permission from the New York School for the Deaf and Mute in the United States to be an exceptional student. Later, the Washington College for the Deaf and Mute in the United States sent a letter also welcoming me to enroll. Marshal Marshall once helped me. General Oderlun, the Canadian Ambassador to China, forwarded it to me, which was a personal letter from Canadian Prime Minister King encouraging me to work hard and make progress. In particular, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, approved my application to study in the United States at public expense with great enthusiasm and sympathy. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Ministry of Education, and Hang Liwu, Vice Minister, also enthusiastically cultivated me.</p>
<p>Bright Future</p>
<p>I have received letters from deaf and mute friends in various countries and learned that the Netherlands has established a Happiness Promotion Association, which is developing very well. Washington, D.C., in the United States also has deaf and mute organizations, which have enabled American deaf and mute people to enjoy happy lives. Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, has a deaf and mute school with the most complete facilities. The teaching methods are very scientific, which can enable students to progress rapidly. It can be seen that the deaf and mute in various countries have made great strides in education and employment, which makes us feel infinitely bright.</p>
<p>Opportunity to Study</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the General Association of the Chinese Deaf and Mute Association was located in Chongqing, which was an important center for the organization of deaf and mute compatriots throughout the country. Now that we have won, the Association will soon move to Nanjing, because the government has already returned to the capital. However, the deaf and mute supplementary class attached to the General Association has received donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in Chongqing. The class is preparing to reorganize into a formal school so that deaf and mute compatriots in general can have the opportunity to study freely. Now the Association feels an even greater lack of talent, so the Association urgently needs outstanding deaf and mute talent to strengthen its work and promote its cause, so it warmly welcomes participation. If you wish to participate, please send your name, place of origin, family situation, age, address, education level, and a two-inch photo to Comrade Liao Zhi, Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing, or Comrade Peng Xigeng, Statistics Office, Examination Committee, Shiyuan Road, Nanjing for verification, but you must have a face-to-face interview with Comrades Liao and Peng.</p>
<p>Now I am preparing to go abroad. I would like to meet you after I return to China in the future. I wish you good health and happiness. Goodbye!"</p>

<h3>Monthly Household Registration Statistics Report: Method for Calculating Population Increase and Decrease - Clarified by the Ministry of Interior -</h3>
<p>Regarding the revised detailed rules for the implementation of household registration, the population increase and decrease section of the attached monthly household registration statistics report form is divided into four items: immigration, emigration, birth, and death. The meaning of immigration and emigration has been clearly stipulated in Articles 27 and 28 of the revised Household Registration Law. However, population increase and decrease is not limited to the above four items. Any of the circumstances in each clause of Articles 18 and 19 of the same law can also cause population changes.</p>
<p>The original table included immigration, emigration, birth, and death in the increase and decrease column. How should it be calculated? It is reported that the Jiangxi Provincial Government once consulted the Ministry of Interior for clarification, roughly stating that population increase and decrease includes two types: natural increase and decrease due to birth and death, and non-natural increase and decrease due to immigration and emigration. Articles 18 and 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulate that, except for Article 18, Clause 1, which should be registered as a birth, and Article 19, Clause 1, which should be registered as a death, the remaining clauses involve two types of registration for the same event. In addition to registration for establishment of household, removal of household, marriage, divorce, recognition, and adoption, registration for emigration or immigration should be done separately.</p>
<p>The immigration and emigration columns of the monthly household registration statistics report form attached to the detailed rules for the implementation of household registration summarize all non-natural increases and decreases in population. Therefore, in addition to birth and death, all registration populations related to various increases and decreases in population should be included in the calculation. It is also reported that the Ministry of Interior has issued separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to inform them accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Propaganda Committee Chairman Xia, the Lishi Society's Taiwan branch sent someone from the head office. When the Beijing-Shanghai-Ping-Kun reporters were still staying in the Caoshan and Beitou hot spring areas, the officials learned about it, but it was not confirmed. While some reporters took a plane back to Shanghai first (on the 19th), a telegram came, saying that the Chairman would arrive in Taiwan in the afternoon. The Provincial Party Department was holding a Party affairs work review meeting. At about 2:00 PM, the officials went to Songshan Airport with Chief Secretary Li Yizhong, Garrison Commander Chief of Staff Ke Yuanfen, Youth League Director Li Youbang, and Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chaoqin. Following them were General Affairs Director Chen Xizeng and Director Yu Jishi, and 25 others. Some of them stayed at Caoshan, and some stayed at the Lishi Society.</p>
<p>At 3:45 PM on the 21st, the Meiling landed at the airport with the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman smiled and said to the welcoming people, "Good, good!" After receiving flowers, the Madam turned to Secretary-General Ge to talk. After taking the first step in visiting Taiwan Province, the great Supreme Leader took a car to the headquarters!</p>
<p>The Head of State's headquarters is located in the Guanbin Hotel in Caoshan. This is a quiet hot spring area with a climate that is 5 degrees lower than Taipei. The mountain road is a wide, high-grade road surface, and the hotel is both elegant and quiet. In the past, the Japanese rulers used it as a palace to welcome Emperor Showa, but now it is the residence of our victorious leader of the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<p>At about 12:00 PM on the 22nd, Madam Chiang appeared in the most prosperous area of Taipei City - Wenwu Street. She was lightly dressed and traveled simply. Passers-by stepped forward to look up at her. The Madam wore a black coat, a special gold-edged black leather bag, and high-heeled shoes, and her attitude was calm. She was deeply impressed by the simplicity of the Lishi Society when she was there.</p>
<p>The 25th was the Taiwan Retrocession Day. On this day last year, Chief Executive Chen Yi represented the Chairman in accepting the surrender of the Japanese at Zhongshan Hall. On this day this year, the Chairman and his wife personally visited the hall to receive the warm welcome of the provincial compatriots!</p>
<p>The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chief Executive Chen and his wife, went to the welcome meeting. The applause from the bottom of the hearts of more than 3,000 people sounded like thunder and lasted for five minutes when the Chairman appeared in front of the crowd. Outside the venue, the cheers of tens of thousands of people never stopped.</p>
<p>The Chairman took a jeep and stood and saluted the people who welcomed him along the way. A kind of great and kind appeal was deeply imprinted in the minds of everyone.</p>
<p>Inside the meeting, the Chairman stood on the stage, and the people were moved to tears by his great and solemn image. People faced the Supreme Leader, recalling his efforts to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will for the nation. His pale hair had won the highest honor of a great man. When he waved his hand with a smile and said, "Thank you everyone, thank you fellow countrymen," he was as kind as an elder to everyone. Yes, he is the elder of every Chinese person. He told the crowd that attending the Retrocession Day meeting in Taiwan was the most gratifying thing in his life, because for 51 years, the Chairman had fulfilled his wish to restore Taiwan, which he had cherished since Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, when Speaker Huang Chaoqin delivered a congratulatory speech, Head of State Chiang nodded with a smile!</p>
<p>At 11:10 AM on the same morning, the Chairman and his wife appeared on the podium of the first Provincial Games at the Taiwan University sports field. Facing the Chairman was a large portrait of the Chairman, appearing remotely across the square in front of tens of thousands of young people. Hao Gengsheng, sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education, told reporters that this was the third time the Chairman had attended the Games, and he always attended without fail. The Chairman attaches great importance to national health!</p>
<p>After leaving the podium, he helped his wife down the stairs and went to the Taipei City First Guest House for rest. This guest house was formerly the residence of the Japanese Governor-General, and General He Yingqin also stayed here when he visited Taiwan before.</p>
<p>The Chairman's visit to Taiwan is not only the glory of the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan, but also the glory of the people throughout the country. The people welcomed the Supreme Leader who recovered the lost land and returned Taiwan to the motherland with the most enthusiastic emotions.</p>

<h3>Northeast Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>— Shenyang Air Dispatch, October 25th, Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Vast fields of agricultural produce and thriving industry and mining have created the wealth of the Northeast, but the people suffer from disaster, reduced to begging with golden bowls, because the rivers frequently overflow and cause harm. Water conservancy projects have not been fully utilized and developed. This year, the lower reaches of the Liao River alone suffered a disaster, and residents of the Panshan area are estimated to have lost as much as 5 billion Northeast circulating yuan. There are still places where the floodwaters have not receded, leaving the people in dire straits!</p>
<p>When the Japanese occupied the Northeast, they established the puppet Manchukuo regime and implemented the so-called continental policy, immigrating and cultivating, and vigorously managing it. Initially, the Songhua River basin was the center of colonization, gradually extending southward to the Liao River basin, and then gradually expanding to the Andong area. Later, because the Songhua River and Liao River were successively flooded in 1933 and 1935, causing great losses, they realized the importance of river regulation.</p>
<p>At the same time, agricultural production increases and heavy industry development are inextricably linked to water conservancy. Therefore, they were determined to establish water conservancy institutions extensively, engaging in surveying and measurement of various rivers, as well as hydrological observation, and formulating construction and management plans for flood control, irrigation, navigation, hydropower, and canal excavation, and began construction. Until the Japanese surrendered on August 15th, the above work never stopped. The scale of their projects, the breadth of the planned scope, the amount of human and financial resources invested, the speed of implementation, and the magnitude of the results are all worthy of our attention!</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Design and Management</p>
<p>Since the enemy puppets attached importance to water conservancy construction in 1933, they formulated the "Comprehensive Northeast River Management Plan." To implement and complete the plan, they successively established the "Water Management Survey Office," "Flood Control and Land Development Bureau," "Agricultural Land Development Bureau," "Manchurian Colonization Corporation," and "Central Water Conservancy Association." In addition, there were eleven engineering offices in Zhangwu, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Mudanjiang, Yilin, Jilin, Nenjiang, Hulun, Heihe, Dongning, and Hunchun, responsible for flood control, irrigation, drainage, hydropower, dike consolidation, and canal port surveys, as well as surveying, design, and implementation for all rivers in the Northeast. By the time of the Japanese surrender, the entire Liao River comprehensive management plan had been completed, and the Songhua River comprehensive management plan was five or six tenths complete. The remaining rivers were still in the data collection stage, and no management plans had been started.</p>
<p>The aforementioned planned programs that have been designed and implemented include: (1) In terms of hydrology: 874 hydrological and meteorological stations have been established, and years of measurement records have been printed into books. (2) In terms of water storage and flood control: a total of 19 reservoirs are planned to be built, of which three have been completed: the Dedai on the Liu River, the Xiaofengman on the Second Songhua River, and the Jingbo Lake on the Mudan River. Three reservoirs, on the Dongliao River, Taizi River, and Hun River, are under construction and have not been completed. (3) In terms of irrigation and drainage: the total area of projects under construction but not completed is 2,932,529 mu, and the area that has been completed and has water conservancy effects is 4,440,205 mu. (4) In terms of dike consolidation: the planned length of dikes to be repaired and consolidated is 5,972 kilometers, of which about half have been repaired and consolidated.</p>
<p>In addition, large-scale projects such as hydropower generation, canal excavation, and port construction will be reported in detail below.</p>
<p>Northeast Port Facilities</p>
<p>Apart from the ports of Dalian and Lushun, which have been improved due to international relations, the remaining ports, such as Dadong, Andong, Yingkou, and Huludao, were all planned to be improved during the enemy's occupation. However, due to their external aggression, all human and financial resources were used for military-related undertakings. Therefore, for more than ten years, there has been no active construction project for the management of the ports of Yingkou, Andong, and Huludao.</p>
<p>The Japanese believed that the development of Dadong Port was beneficial to wartime transportation between Japan and puppet Manchukuo, and that the port had excellent natural conditions and the conditions for establishing an industrial city. Therefore, in 1937, the South Manchuria Railway and the puppet Manchukuo government jointly invested in the project.</p>
<p>The construction plan of Dadong Port is divided into three parts: first, the harbor and wharf warehouse project, with the goal of building a harbor where ships with a deadweight of 4,000 tons and a draft of 7.4 meters can freely navigate at mid-tide level, and a wharf and warehouse capable of loading and unloading four cargo ships simultaneously; second, building an industrial city covering an area of 176 square kilometers, capable of accommodating one million people; third, constructing a 24-kilometer railway project from Dadong to Andong. The extent to which the above plans have been completed is currently unknown due to lack of information.</p>
<p>Opening North-South Canals</p>
<p>The canals planned to be opened by the Japanese puppets are two: one is the waterway connecting Shenyang, Anshan, and Yingkou—referred to by the enemy puppets as the South Manchuria Canal, and the other is the Songliao Canal, which runs through the north-south water system. The former was planned by the Japanese in 1935 and completed in 1940. After detailed research on the water use issue, it was considered that there was no need to worry, but construction had not yet begun. As for the latter, it was in the data collection stage, and there was no specific plan to be examined.</p>
<p>The southern canal of the Northeast is the general name for the canal connecting the cities of Yingkou, Anshan, and Shenyang, with a total length of 219 kilometers. Its route is from Yingkou to Tangmazhai, 93 kilometers long, and from there to Shenyang, 102 kilometers long, and to Anshan, 24 kilometers long. In the entire route, the newly opened river channel is 86 kilometers long, the Taizi River channel is 95 kilometers long, and the lower Liao River channel is 38 kilometers long. In order to regulate the water level difference of each river channel, it is planned to build eleven ship locks.</p>
<p>Various Water Conservancy Projects</p>
<p>The cross-sectional bottom width of the Southern Canal plan is 20 meters, the water surface width is 30 meters, and the slope of the two banks is 1:25 meters. It is estimated that once this project is completed, 600-ton steamships can travel smoothly day and night. The total budget for this project was estimated at 26,190,000 puppet Manchukuo yuan in 1940. How many times more would it cost to do it now?</p>
<p>In the past, most of the cultivated land in the Northeast was dry land. Since the Japanese used Koreans to plant paddy fields, many Chinese have also followed suit. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese set up institutions such as the "Agricultural Land Development Bureau" to promote the immigration policy, presiding over the opening of paddy fields. The paddy fields that have been created and are planned to be opened are distributed in the main agricultural areas of the Songliao water system. Among them, the larger ones include the Dongliao River irrigation area, the Liao River main stream irrigation area, the Haicheng River drainage area, the Hun River irrigation area, the Songhua River drainage and irrigation area, the Mudanjiang drainage and irrigation area, the Wo Ken River irrigation area, the Ussuri River irrigation area, the Yalu River irrigation area, and the Panshan land improvement area. There are many other large and small farmland water conservancy projects scattered in various river basins. Among them, except for a few smaller projects that have been fully completed, the remaining large irrigation areas have only been partially completed. We must shoulder this heavy burden.</p>
<p>The Northeast has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is especially rich in mineral products and industrial raw materials. In order to plunder and develop these, and to save energy, the Japanese actively sought the development of water power. This work began in 1934. As of August 1945, a total of 45 sites had been obtained that could be used to build dams for water storage and power generation. The total expected average power generation is 3,274,000 kilowatts. Among them, the Xiaofengman on the Songhua River, the Jingbo Lake on the Mudan River, and the Shuifeng Hydropower Plant on the Yalu River have been successively constructed and largely completed. The Yunfeng and Weiyuan on the Yalu River, the Huanren on the Hun River, and the Shenwo on the Taizi River have been under construction but not completed. The rest have not yet been handled. The ones that have been successful are already considerable if the machinery is not damaged or moved away. If each one is completed, it would be a truly great power undertaking!</p>
<p>The larger rivers in the Northeast are mostly silted and shallow in the south, and mostly rocky and dangerous in the north. Therefore, before the September 18th Incident, although their lower reaches were navigable, they were all navigable with great difficulty, relying on their natural conditions. There were no detailed statistics on the mileage of navigable waterways. Since 1932, in order to strengthen plunder and cooperate with land transportation, the Japanese carried out major repairs, using the Liao River as the main trunk in the south and the Songhua River as the main trunk in the north, and also including the border rivers Yalu River, Ussuri River, and Heilongjiang. They engaged in projects such as adding dikes, dredging shallows, blasting rocks, building weirs to channel water, and building dams to store floods. By the summer of 1942, there were 7,139 kilometers of navigable waterways for steamships and 4,524 kilometers for wooden boats. In order to strengthen control, the enemy puppets had established three navigation bureaus in Harbin, Yingkou, and Andong to manage matters such as ship piloting and navigation marks in different areas, and opened regular shipping routes to various ports. Therefore, Northeast shipping was said to be developed by the Japanese. However, since the restoration, the river channels have gradually fallen into disrepair, and ships have been lost. It will not be easy to restore the old appearance without re-organizing the river channels and adding new ships.</p>
<p>Current Issues</p>
<p>Although the current situation in the Northeast is not completely stable, there are already many water conservancy projects that can be implemented in the plains of the Liao River and Songhua River water systems. There are even more projects that should be carried out in the future. According to the person in charge of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, according to the current situation of water conservancy in the Northeast, the urgent matters for water conservancy construction in the future are: First, to restore hydrological and meteorological observation stations: There are 874 hydrological and meteorological observation stations in the Northeast. After the Japanese surrendered, they have all been suspended. It is a pity that records have been interrupted for a year. The office has now started an investigation and will restore them separately within the possible scope of locations. It is estimated that more than 100 stations can be set up in the areas occupied by the national army, and the rest will be restored gradually.</p>
<p>Second, strengthen the maintenance and management of completed projects: Projects completed during the puppet Manchukuo period, such as the dikes of the Da River, the reservoirs of the Liu River, and irrigation projects in various places, should be well maintained and managed to avoid destruction. According to the dikes in the lower reaches of the Liao River and its large and small tributaries, except for the Raoyang River, more than 3,000 kilometers have been completed. However, in recent years, they have not been maintained and repaired, resulting in more than 100 breaches this year, and the seven or eight counties in the affected areas have suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the maintenance and management of completed projects must be strengthened. Third, complete the water conservancy projects that were started but not completed during the puppet Manchukuo period. When the enemy puppets surrendered last year, those that had been started but not completed and those that had been damaged should be resumed and completed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Water conservancy projects in the Northeast have been deeply valued and operated purely by the Japanese puppets, sparing no effort. The losses caused by the suspension and abandonment of these projects in the past year are impossible to count. According to the statistics of the Northeast Administrative Economic Committee, this year, only the rice production is only 17% of the normal output. Therefore, all parties expect water conservancy projects to be actively developed. The Northeast Branch of the Executive Headquarters, the Northeast Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the provincial and municipal governments have repeatedly discussed the resumption of water conservancy projects in various places with the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, and are willing to bear part of the construction costs and materials or manpower, hoping to promote the matter as soon as possible. For this arduous task, the Water Conservancy Commission should establish a permanent institution in the Northeast as soon as possible to take over the responsibility, so that the water conservancy construction in the Northeast will not only not gradually become desolate after we take over, but also achieve "full utilization of water and land," which is crucial to the national economy and the people's livelihood!</p>
<h3>Interlude of the Jining Battle</h3>
<p>— Fengzhen News, October 6th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan</p>
<p>The Great Achievements of Xing Guanjun</p>
<p>Chief Fu said very humbly about the victory of the Jining Battle: "This is the success of the people's will." In fact, the people certainly need a victorious Jining Battle, and to achieve the people's will, there must also be a good army to carry it out. The brilliant results of the 12th War Zone this time can be said to be entirely based on precise training, good military discipline, and strong morale of officers and soldiers. To illustrate this factor, we would like to cite a figure as a representative of the officers and soldiers of the 12th War Zone. Who is this representative? It is Major Xing Guanjun, the captain of the Second Company of the Third Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, who occupied Tie Jun Mountain, counterattacked Wolong Mountain, and died in the assault on the city on September 12th.</p>
<p>The name Xing Guanjun caused a sensation in every barracks on the left flank of the national defense as early as the Baotou Battle in 1939. He was from Xiliu Village, Hunyuan, Shanxi, and was also from a military family. His great-grandfather Xing Wenxing was a martial arts Jinshi and served as a general under Luo Enju during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, suppressing the Miao rebellion in the southwest. However, by the time of his grandfather, the family gradually declined, so he drifted to</p>
<p>Fengzhen when he was thirteen years old; he first served as a soldier in the 68th Division, and joined the 35th Army in Houtao when Sun Dianying was put down in 1934. After the Anti-Japanese War, he was promoted from bugler to warrant officer squad leader. Because of the Baotou Battle, he occupied a Caishenmiao Street with a copper bugle, ten national flags, and six hand grenades, and he was the first to take down Shixing Elementary School in the Wuyuan Battle. Chief Chuan promoted him to major company commander out of turn.</p>
<p>Guanjun not only knew how to fight, but also treated his comrades as brothers on weekdays, training them all to be lively and energetic, and everyone knew how to fight. His company was enough for ten companies to use. During the Jining Battle, he was also the first to put the national flag on the top of Tie Jun Mountain. Seeing that the Second "Victory" Battalion could not take down Wolong Mountain, he led a company through a hail of machine gun fire, and took down Wolong Mountain again from the enemy's rear. After the "Victory" Detachment soldiers died in the assault on the city on the 12th, they issued a sad cry of "Revenge for Xing Guanjun" and rushed into the southwest corner of the city in one breath. Chief Chuan renamed Tie Jun Mountain Guanjun Mountain in memory of Xing Guanjun's great achievements. The "Victory" Detachment Commander said with tears in his eyes to the people: "Xing Guanjun was only twenty-nine years old this year. He had just gotten engaged in Taolin, but he canceled it before leaving. He came into this world, really, to live for the country and to die for the country."</p>

<h3>Record of Returning Home in Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Before the Trip</p>
<p>I have a bit of hatred for chalk, because the life of chalk is mixed with coal smoke and dust, making me tired. All that remains of the scenery of my hometown, immersed in the greenery of mountains and the ripples of water, is a vague dream image. This semester, Zhijiang moved back to its old nest in Hangzhou. Although it is closer to my hometown, there is no way to give up my home in Shanghai, and it is difficult enough to support a family of eight with chalk. So I still left teaching to go into business. I will never forget five years ago, when life was peaceful, teaching and researching my own interests. But soon, enemy cavalry invaded even this clean land under the amulet. At that time, I was at Daxia, and I got a line of poetry in a dream: "A thousand years of sitting, the old Buddha is merciless." When I woke up, I completed a seven-character律 poem. I remember writing it on the blackboard for the students to see. The last two lines were "The cunning Xia meet in the double eight numbers, and only see grass and smoke in Si Gan." The double eight numbers refer to 8.13 and 12.8. Since then, I have retired into business, and poetry has not been made. What has been made is only a school of worry and anger, the so-called "My heart is like the dry land of Liling, and my hair is like the messy silk of Suiyang." And Li Bake, in his preface to my "A Dust of Grass," said, "For the eight years of sorrow and depression, everyone has witnessed the scars and disasters and changed their poetry." Scars, I am one of them. I think, eight years later, I can always return to the peaceful life of the past, but the high pressure of the whip of life is still the same. Chalk is not possible, and the dream of home cannot be found. It is autumn, and I miss even more the ancient hometown city at the end of the sky. I heard that my home has really become four walls, because all the utensils, even a piece of wood and a stone, have been stolen and sold by unworthy members of the same clan. Even the property rights have been shaken, which makes me have to return. Before the trip, my heart should contain a component of joy, but it is so confused and turning over.</p>
<p>Tired dreams of the world are immeasurable,</p>
<p>A short rest tomorrow to cross the Qiantang;</p>
<p>My heart is happy only for the sake of the journey home,</p>
<p>Waiting to see the faint light break through the paper window.</p>
<p>Passing Songjiang</p>
<p>It seems to be "like a bird escaping from a cage, and returning to nature." As the train drove to the distant suburbs, passing through the plains, forests, and green mountains, surrounded by blue waves, yes, it was a picture of nature that I had not seen for many years. Although I had not closed my eyes all night last night, I was still very excited. I kept staring around, not willing to let a single blade of grass or a cloud easily pass through my sight. Soon, the car arrived at Songjiang Station.</p>
<p>Songjiang is a large station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and it is also a place worthy of lingering and reminiscing in the eyes of later generations. Because this is where the story of "Zhang Han" takes place. Zhang Han, also known as Jiying, was from Songjiang. It was also such an autumn, when the autumn wind rose, he suddenly thought of his hometown, Songjiang's water shield and perch, so he resigned and returned home. Therefore, water shield and perch have become famous products of Songjiang. In fact, this "fame" is only沾ed光 by that story. The immortal poet Li Taibai also sang it in his poem "This trip is not for the perch slices, but to love the famous mountains and enter Shanzhong." As for Zhang Han's homesickness, it was not really for the water shield and perch. He was a man who knew the situation and felt that there would be no good results if he continued to be greedy, so he took the opportunity to leave, with the meaning of "protecting oneself wisely."</p>
<p>In the present, this kind of thinking is naturally not acceptable, but with a heart that is greedy for official positions, there is an excessive greed, and what takes shape is a团糟, who is willing to have Zhang Jiying's autumn wind on the river homesickness!</p>
<p>The river flows here to talk about water shield and perch,</p>
<p>Not suspending the car to protect oneself,</p>
<p>A thousand years of autumn wind, a vain sandal,</p>
<p>Coming back to bow, whom else?</p>

<h3>Me and the Mirror</h3>
<p>— Su Dan</p>
<p>As a child, I was as interested in mirrors as I was in flying kites and fighting crickets. How that interest arose, it is difficult to say now. But it was always due to curiosity, why is it so shiny and spotless? Why can it reflect people's faces and other things without any distortion? Such questions have been asked. Although I asked my mother and father, my mother's answer was very vague, and what my father said was the word mercury reflection, which was not very clear in my mind. So when I encountered a mirror, I always had strange thoughts.</p>
<p>There was an olive-shaped mirror on the dressing table in my mother's room, so when I came back from school, I threw down my schoolbag and went to the dressing table to make a few funny faces in the mirror: sticking out my tongue, pouting, shrugging my eyebrows and winking, all kinds of funny faces. And the most common thing to do was to use both hands to pull my eyes and mouth open at the same time, a so-called cat face, and after meowing a few times like a cat, I would run outside to play. Interestingly, sometimes when I quarreled with my classmates at school, I had several ink marks on my face when I came back, but I often forgot to go to the mirror to look at it, and I didn't remember the mirror until others laughed at me. In addition, when I was happy, I would run into the room and make funny faces in the mirror. Especially after getting something to eat from my mother, chewing in front of the mirror, watching my own mouth, arching up very high like a pig eating, seemed to be the thing I felt most interested in.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I was playing happily with a group of playmates in the sun, I suddenly thought of something, sneaked into my mother's room, secretly touched and brought out that oval mirror, pointed it at the sun, reflected its light on the white wall, and watched the ball of white light from afar, and then looked at the surprised and admiring eyes of my playmates around me, I was really happy. With a wave of my hand, the white light on the wall flickered. When I was excited, I even used it to shine on my playmates' faces, telling them not to dare to open their eyes and lower their heads. Other animals such as cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, and pigs have all been shone, and even the sparrows singing peacefully under the eaves have often been scared away by my beam of white light.</p>
<p>This practice has a source; at that time, I was reading some fairy tales, sword fairies, knights, demons, etc., filling my mind. I knew there was something called "demon-revealing mirror," and all demons and ghosts would show their true form under it. So I imitated it myself, comparing myself to a god, and regarded the mirror in my hand as a magic weapon for subduing demons.</p>
<p>Naturally, this kind of plaything was forbidden by my mother. Occasionally, when my mother found out, I was always scolded, and the mirror in my hand was taken away. I knew that my mother didn't allow me to play like this, not entirely because she was afraid that I would accidentally drop and break the mirror, but she also seemed to know that she was doing it for something, but I couldn't figure out what this "something" was. As soon as it was dusk and the room was dark, my mother would turn her olive-shaped mirror upside down on the table. This action became her habit, and she would never forget it. I have asked what the reason for this is, and not just once or twice, but I have never received an answer. Sometimes she even scolded: "Don't talk too much." So, what is the mirror used for after all? I was even more confused. And the mirror became even more mysterious in my mind.</p>
<p>As I grew older, the mystery of the mirror in my heart gradually melted away like the early spring snow. I no longer felt strange about my mother's action of turning the mirror upside down at night. My mother's mind was caught by the idea of superstition in ghosts and gods, and turning the mirror upside down was to avoid taboos. I no longer stood in front of the mirror making funny faces or taking it in the sun to shine on people and dogs and cats. It is natural to think wildly to make others show their true colors. Now, occasionally when I recall this, I really feel funny. Isn't the consciousness of childhood purely a realm of dreams?</p>
<p>I think this way: What is the great use of a mirror? All that it gives to people or things is a relief reproduction. Everything that exists has its own inherent factors of existence. Therefore, I don't love mirrors anymore. Just like I don't like a frivolous and deceitful person.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I left home and ran to Chongqing, wading through mountains and rivers, and I still carried a jade-colored mirror in my luggage. Now that I have come to Shanghai, this mirror is still hanging on the wall in my bedroom. Because it has been through many years, one of its feet has been broken, and its shape and color have changed greatly. But I don't feel any regret because of this. Except for combing my hair or having to tidy up my clothes, I don't pay much attention to it after waving it in front of it. Because I think that the me in the mirror may not be me. You have to look deeper to find yourself.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 80</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>With this excuse of delivering a message, we also made the most of the opportunity to say things she liked to hear. She was very happy, complaining that we hadn't been to the village in so long that we had become strangers. Taking advantage of this, we asked her to find us a quiet place to rest. She thought for a moment and suggested "Zhaoxian Hall," which was very quiet before 3 o'clock; after 3 o'clock, the gambling would start, and the girls would be on the market, making it very lively. We told her that we hadn't had a good rest all night and needed a place to lie down, and that we didn't want to join in the fun. She said that if we didn't mind the condition, we could go to her room, where there was a large kang (heated brick bed) and no one would bother us. This was a very ideal place. We gave her two military scrip in advance, ostensibly to ask her to arrange two bowls of zhajiang noodles for us.</p>
<p>When this woman said, "if you don't mind the condition," I thought she was being polite. It wasn't until she led us into this room that I realized she was telling the truth. This room not only deserved the word "condition," but first of all, it was not ventilated. The adjacent room was the kitchen, and the smell of cooking oil and coal smoke constantly seeped through the cracks in the partition wall, making one feel nauseous. Tiger Brother called it the "nineteenth layer of oily smoke hell." But we ate the noodles here and discussed the things we were preparing to do.</p>
<p>Our first step was to draw a simplified map of the terrain inside the prohibited area. Based on the information provided by Lao Kuai, we made a rough estimate of the routes, obstacles, gasoline dumps, armories, guard posts, entertainment venues, etc. We argued about one point: Tiger Brother wanted to sneak into the entertainment venue and kill Yin, the traitor, while I advocated acting according to the situation. Destroying the armory or gasoline depot would be enough to diminish the enemy's arrogance and give them a blow. I used the dialectical method of pros and cons to convince Tiger Brother. Because although Yin, the traitor, was a source of trouble, his life was not worth a dog's life. Even if we got rid of him, the Japanese could immediately install another puppet.</p>
<p>Next, we discussed the method of retreat. In my imagination, I believed that the safest way was for the deed to be exposed only after we had retreated, which was the best strategy. We had to understand that this was a tiger's den, and no matter how powerful we were, we only had two legs and two hands. In any case, we should avoid obvious conflicts as much as possible.</p>
<p>Before the retreat problem was solved, Tiger Brother had already fallen on the kang and fallen into a deep sleep. I was also finding it hard to keep my eyes open, but because of the dangerous environment, I had to force myself to stay awake. This situation was even more difficult than fighting guerrilla warfare outside the customs. When fighting guerrilla warfare, although we were exposed to the sun, wind, rain, and cold, we had plenty of fresh air. This room, not to mention fresh air, was not even ventilated, and the oily smoke in the air could almost be grabbed in handfuls; moreover, the weather was unusually hot and stuffy, almost suffocating or causing heatstroke.</p>
<p>I don't remember when I also fell asleep on the kang, only knowing that I was sleeping soundly when I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise. I sat up with a start, my heart pounding uncontrollably; the loud noise was strange, constantly echoing in my ears. After calming down a little and listening carefully, I realized that it was the sound of gongs and drums, coming from the adjacent room, making my head spin. At the same time, I felt very uncomfortable all over, inexplicably uncomfortable. "Am I sick?" I thought to myself, but after a slight touch, I couldn't help but laugh, realizing that the clothes on my body were soaked through with sweat, sticking to my body. I looked at Tiger Brother, who was still sleeping soundly. I touched his forehead, which was dry and without a trace of sweat. Later, I heard that this was because he had practiced qigong.</p>
<p>After a lot of effort, I finally understood that this room was a dark room; one side connected to the kitchen, and the other was the "Zhaoxian Hall" club. Usually, Peking opera was performed here, or practiced, or sung solo, or Kun opera troupes performed, and sometimes amateurs played for fun, anyway, it was lively and fun. The other two walls were gambling dens. They were also open at this time. The only light in this room, twenty-four hours a day, came from a few skylights on the roof and a small five-candlepower light bulb.</p>

<h3>Hard and Soft</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A peanut vendor in Hong Kong was kicked to death by an Indian policeman. Although the Indian policeman has been handed over to the authorities for interrogation, the resentment of all the residents remaining in Hong Kong has not subsided, and it may cause a larger storm. In the seventeenth issue of the News World Monthly, which was published the day before yesterday, there was an article entitled "Blood and Sweat Gold Nourishes Hong Kong," which is sufficient to provide us with a reference for understanding the policies of the local government. There is this section:</p>
<p>Right on the pier of the Star Ferry, a Royal Navy sailor triumphantly raised a glass bottle and smashed it against the head of a well-dressed young woman. The poor beauty had her head broken and bleeding, and her beautiful face was also cut by the glass. The Royal Navy sailor swaggered away. This represents the "hard" policy. The most successful trick of the policy enforcer on the "soft" side is the recent large-scale distribution of relief food packages from the Red Cross. Each household received one package, unconditionally. The package contained more than a dozen cans, which everyone praised. The bloodstains left by the Royal Navy glass bottle were all covered up by those food packages. This soft and hard policy can be called a "masterpiece" of British rule in the colonies.</p>
<p>The Indian policeman naturally appeared as a ruler; otherwise, how dare he arbitrarily bully the people? Dogs rely on their masters. If the masters' arrogance remains, then this kind of thing will happen more and more in the future. Naturally, the Hong Kong authorities are now trying their best to use soft tactics in this case.</p>
<p>Recovering Hong Kong is one of the goals we should strive for according to reason, but what is even more important is to change the imperialist ideas of those who consider themselves to be superior races.</p>
<h3>Youth is Wasted for Love: The Windsors are Old</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>When Edward Windsor was born on June 23, 1894, he was already the son of a duke. He received a good family education from an early age. At the age of thirteen, he entered the naval academy as a cadet. After two years of training, he was promoted to midshipman and underwent three months of sea training on a cruiser. When he was sixteen, his father George V ascended the throne, and Windsor became the crown prince, still serving in the navy. His character was gentle and sincere, and his youthful life at sea broadened his mind. He was the first of the British royal family to love to travel. From his travels, he experienced the real life outside the court. He once said: "The sea is my religion." What he sought was only the life of an ordinary person. He was enthusiastic about studying ways to improve unemployment and slum housing problems. He could not stand the arrogance and arrogance of the aristocracy. Therefore, the royal women he met in the social arena only felt hypocritical and ridiculous. Until the age of forty-two, he still lived a single life.</p>
<p>Let us turn the clock back to 1895. In the northeast of Washington, D.C., in the United States, in the city of Potomac, a girl named Peihsi Wallfield was born. Her biological father was the owner of a public office. He died when she was two years old, leaving the girl and her mother to depend on each other for life. The family was poor, which contributed to her floating life. At the age of twenty-one, she married Lieutenant Spencer. The wedding was held on November 8, 1916. Their marital relationship lasted until 1925. Later, she met Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, senior staff of the New York Shipping Company, while playing tennis. Mr. Simpson divorced his wife and married Peihsi in London in 1928. From then on, she became Mrs. Simpson, entering and leaving the social circles of the British capital.</p>
<p>Windsor and Peihsi met at a banquet at this time. At that time, Windsor had already ascended the throne and still maintained his consistent civilian ideas. Peihsi was gentle in demeanor and, because she had experienced the world, the two became close friends in conversation, and their relationship grew stronger. After 1934, the emperor of Great Britain simply could not leave Mrs. Simpson for a moment. In December 1936, the Parliament did not approve of Windsor's marriage to Mrs. Simpson. He would rather give up the throne to obtain marital autonomy, creating discussion material that shocked the world.</p>
<p>On June 3, 1937, they were married in France in the name of the Duke of Windsor and Miss Wallfield. The ceremony was simple, and the total number of guests, including journalists, was only fifty.</p>
<p>Later, the Duke of Windsor was appointed governor of a British island near the Americas. For ten years, there have been constant records in newspapers of various countries about the actions of him and his wife. They returned to England the other day, which was their first return home since September 1939.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Windsor are both over half a century old this year. They have been married for ten years, and the relationship between the couple has always been loving. Windsor has never regretted losing the throne. Mrs. Windsor looks like she will take her third marriage as her permanent home. They have already established immortal achievements for mankind; they have written the greatness of love into history!</p>
<h3>The Waistline Has Increased</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiren</p>
<p>Amsterdam in the Netherlands is one of the world's famous financial markets. There is a circus there, and the seats have never been numbered. They are uniform benches. During the war, they could accommodate 3,400 spectators. Since the end of the war and the restoration of peace more than a year ago, the circus has only been able to accommodate 3,160 spectators. The circus had to refuse another 250 spectators. This means that the circus authorities have invisibly lost the price of 250 tickets per show!</p>
<p>At first, the person in charge was confused and could not figure it out. Later, he finally knew the secret; he discovered that the average waistline of the Dutch people had increased by three inches in the year since the victory of the war. After all, world peace is conducive to their lives; they no longer need to tighten their belts. They can now enjoy everything in peacetime, so their bodies have also become fatter!</p>
<p>But looking at our countrymen, how much has their waistline increased?</p>

<h3>Dancers and Dance Halls 3</h3>
<p>— Jia Mo</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, the total number of dancers registered with the Municipal Police Bureau is 2,032. There are 25 dance halls in the city. (There are also small dance halls that have not been listed). Their names and the number of dancers assigned to them are as follows:</p>
<p>Xianle 46 people</p>
<p>Paramount 30 people</p>
<p>Metropolitan 36 people</p>
<p>Vienna 85 people</p>
<p>Great East 141 people</p>
<p>Venus 99 people</p>
<p>Jinshan 49 people</p>
<p>Imperial Palace 62 people</p>
<p>Saint Tale 25 people</p>
<p>Central 123 people</p>
<p>New Metropolitan 24 people</p>
<p>Dalu 101 people</p>
<p>Huadu 156 people</p>
<p>Lido 70 people</p>
<p>New Xianlin 85 people</p>
<p>Dahu 123 people</p>
<p>MGM 101 people</p>
<p>Dahua 90 people</p>
<p>Xinhua 45 people</p>
<p>Far East 60 people</p>
<p>Yangtze 103 people</p>
<p>Cathay 48 people</p>
<p>United Nations 31 people</p>
<p>Victory 86 people</p>
<p>Gaofeng 58 people</p>
<p>Red Star</p>
<p>The dancers in the dance halls now are divided into two levels: those who sit in seats and those who do not. That is, those who sit in the seats around the dance floor are one type, and those who do not sit in seats and wait for customers to call them to sit are another type. This is the difference between "Red Star" and "Non-Red Star." Generally, the number of Red Stars accounts for about 15 to 18 percent of the total.</p>
<p>To become a Red Star, one needs to excel in "beauty," "art," "social skills," and "style" to pass. They need to have a large number of customers flocking to them and paying fees. But they still cannot rely solely on the income from regular dance tickets to maintain themselves. Because even if they transfer tables six times a night (each ticket averaging 10,000 yuan), at most they can only redeem 30,000 yuan in cash. This is not enough for their huge expenses. Their biggest income still depends on the huge allowances from wealthy customers, and the subtle relationship and exchange conditions in between are naturally worth speculating about by outsiders. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>New Grain</p>
<p>In the midst of the soaring prices of all commodities, new grain has been harvested. In theory, farmers can take a breather, but in several rice-producing cities near Shanghai, rice prices are falling day by day, and farmers in the countryside are eager to sell, further creating a situation of poor sales. Indica rice has plummeted to 33,000 yuan per picul. It is said that bank loans to farmers require gold bars in addition to store guarantees. How many people in the countryside can dig out gold bars from the fields? Therefore, under the threat of high prices, farmers have to resort to usurious loans with interest rates of more than three cents. This phenomenon of robbing Peter to pay Paul is probably too late for us to study and formulate some kind of "economic plan for reorganizing the countryside" to carry out rescue work. The cold winter is approaching, and the farming tools have not been repaired. Although people in the cities are now dizzy with milk powder and cod liver oil, our foundation of life will still be built on that vast and fertile land. I wonder if everyone has pondered this reason when they temporarily leave the "glass world" and dream in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>Turning Head Rat</p>
<p>What is Japan like after the war? I am afraid that most of us have forgotten it! The New York Times said: "Among the defeated Axis countries, Japan has the fastest signs of recovery; the Japanese people are still actively strong and capable, and do not seem to be discouraged by the defeat." Most importantly, "the recovery of Japanese industry is sufficient to meet domestic needs and a large number of exports." The Transformation Society also said: "Japan has been ordered to manufacture wool fabrics, which will be exported to distant markets." Perhaps because of these reasons? Bevin, in his speech in the House of Commons, has already made a statement of "being extremely willing to conclude a special and lasting peace with Japan." Ma Chang, the chief writer of the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun, also said with a flourish: "For the sake of creating world peace, the United Nations should store a batch of atomic bombs in Japan and assign the peace-loving Japanese to keep them." Good fellow! Look how energetic they are! Look, haven't they presented the "gold-inlaid wooden box" as a congratulatory gift again? Then those large quantities of wool fabrics manufactured "under orders" will be supplied again! Are we, after being tired of enjoying glazed products, prepared to cheer up again and accept this diligence?</p>
<p>East Wind Westward</p>
<p>The "Self-Reliance Movement for the Disabled" promoted by the United States to promote post-war demobilization has been underway for nearly two years. In the meantime, I don't know how many unnamed heroes who returned injured from the battlefield have received the comfort of precious warmth in the society without regret in the pain of broken limbs and arms. Recently, I heard that their Congress has also passed a bill to implement "National Disability Employment Week," preparing to launch another relief movement on a wider scale based on human compassion and love. It is really unexpected that the so-called prosperous age of "The Book of Rites: The Great Harmony," one of our national quintessence, in which "the elderly, widows, orphans, and the disabled are all provided for," has been preempted by others, doing it in line with the philosophical precepts of our ancestors. Looking back at ourselves: many groups of people who lost their health in the war and became beggars after the victory due to lack of means of survival are begging for survival in the eyes of people who are indifferent, contemptuous, and disgusted, struggling to die. In ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, there is nothing more unfair than this! But now, everything has changed! People are good at adapting to all kinds of sad and tragic phenomena, even if there are some that they don't like, but after seeing them a lot, they get used to them, and everyone feels that it doesn't matter!</p>
