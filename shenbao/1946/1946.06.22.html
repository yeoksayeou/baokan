<h3>蔣主席正式宣佈　停戰令延長八天　三人會議今可能召開</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十一日電〕國民政府蔣主席二十一日正式宣布如下：為予中國共產黨更大之機會，對於停止軍事衝突，恢復交通，整編軍隊及軍隊駐地問題，期得完滿之解決，余前已命令前方指揮官，對於停止前進攻擊追擊之前令，其有效時間，延長至本年六月卅日中午為止。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕可斷可續之和平談判，其前途命運已於今日決定。今下午二時，中宣部長彭學沛，在中宣部辦公大樓向中外記者發表聲明：「政府為表示最大之誠意與忍讓起見，決定將停止前進追擊之命令，延長八日。國民政府主席，已令各軍隊停止前進追擊之命令應延長時效至本年六月三十日中午為止。在此期間，關於停止衝突，恢復交通，整編統編軍隊之協議，必須完成，並鑒於國民之長期痛苦，必須迅速解除，刻不容緩，今後不能再有延誤」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十一日電〕今日下午二時十七分，中宣部長彭學沛，宣讀政府延長停戰限期公吿後，少頃，即接獲國府主席辦公室常話，約五分鐘後，即以在電話中聆悉之國府蔣主席命令，正式公布，致有多數外籍記者，常時未能獲至知蔣席之明令內容。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕今晨九時，馬歇爾往謁蔣主席談一小時，馬使辭出返邸後，旋以電話邀周恩來，周遂於上午十一時往訪馬使，談約半小時，於是此停戰限期展延八日之最後希望，乃吿實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕聞恢復交通之新方案，再經一二次之談判後，即可獲致協議。目前和平談判之問題癥結，仍在整編統編軍隊，此一問題，將由軍事三人會議提出，正式討論。據今日周恩來公開表示，此一會議可能於明日舉行。據有資格之觀察家談：如中共同意政府所提議對馬氏公斷權之新建議，即有隨時舉行之可能。</p>
<h3>中宣部發言人　談協商內容　增加政治問題一項　希望中共誠意商討</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕廿一日晚間，記者為中共代表致政府代表之函件，往訪中宣部發言人，詢問意見。發言人談稱：今日下午，主席宣佈休戰延期後，政府代表接到中共函一件，亦主張繼續休戰，繼續協商，但協商不，期限，而協商內容則除主席休戰令中所提示之停止衝突，恢復交通，整軍復員三項外，再加第四項「由政府經協商定期重開政治協商會議，迅速解決改組政府，保障人權，解救民生，完成統一等各項政治問題。」此第四項固屬重要，然協商會議關於改組政府之決議，實因共方橫生枝節，而未能實行，保障人權辦法，政府已付實施，仍不斷加强，唯望中共區域，亦稍加改善，勿令蘇北一區，即有三百餘萬難民逃出，流離載道，慘不忍睹。至於民生如何未得解救，統一如何未能完成，此中共方面知之甚稔，自此等空泛題目，放之則彌六合，照過去協商經騐，希累月經年，愈談而距離愈遠，故政府主張分別緩急，擇最緊急之三項問題，先行決定實施，此種不同之意見，孰者為愈，想蘇北歡百萬難民，苟能不假思索，立時回答，所幸周恩來將軍對於政府限期月底解決三項緊急問題之主張，宣言將努力以赴，希望中共眞正開誠佈公，懇切商議，則八日之久，三項問題未有不能解決者也。</p>
<h3>東北學生愛國團　在京遊行呼口號</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕東北學生愛國團百餘人，今晨在京遊行，呼籲和平，高呼「東北不容混亂」，「軍令必需統一」，「主權必須完整」，「努力和平建國」等口號，並沿途散發致全國同胞書，情緖極為激昻，市民頗受感動。</p>
<h3>公斷權　以多數決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕據悉：政府方面對公斷權有所說明，凡今後三人會議及執行部之處理問題程序，以多數決定（Majority　Vote）代替全體一致決定，（UnanimouoVote）即三人中有多數之二人同意即可決定、</p>
<h3>中共提四項建議致書　政府代表轉呈主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕周恩來氏對政府決定東北休戰延期至六月卅日事，發表談話如下：「我們對東北軍事衝突，素主長期停戰，今屆十五天休戰期滿之日，中共代表團已於今日根據中共中央訓令，送致建議，更於蔣主席與政府代表仍主立即宣佈東北長期停戰，以便協商一切問題，今政府旣因各方奔走及人民呼籲，宣佈延長停止東北進攻進兵及追擊之命令有效期間至六月卅日，此雖與我們之主張相距甚遠，但凡有一綫和平希望，我們無不努力以赴，故只要政府軍隊遵守政府命令，停止向我方軍隊進攻，我敢保證我方軍隊必堅守原防，以便雙方在馬歇爾將軍協助之下，求得長期停戰，實現和平。」又中共代表團今日致雄議書於蔣主席及政府代表，原文如下：「哲生·鐵城·雪艇·力子·立夫·厲生六先生，幷請轉陳蔣主席賜鑒。自東北休戰以來，全國人心，舉世輿論，莫不渴望我國共兩方在此十五天中，能由於馬歇爾將軍之共同努力，獲得關於交通停戰及東北整軍三項問題之一致協議，使暫時休戰成為長期停戰，以重開和平團結之門。不幸經十五天各方面之奔走努力，政府方面所提整軍方案，竟完全出人意外，企圖將中共部隊在整軍期間，排出大城巿及鐵路綫，以便消滅，幷堅執美方代表團三方協議中之最後決定權，以保證此案之宣施，似此情况，敝方實苦無從考慮，且政府運兵備戰之事日亟，內戰大火有一發難收之勢，屆此緊急關頭，倘再不立即停戰，則人民塗炭，國家糜爛，前途　不堪設想。茲接敝黨中央訓令，根據目前內外情况，全國人民意志認為非迅速停戰，實現和平，不足以挽救當前之嚴重危機，出同胞於水火，爰特向貴方正式提議，實行如下步驟：（一）由三人會議立即宣佈東北長期停戰，並重申全國停戰命令，規定停止一切軍事衝突之具體辦法，命令雙方部隊嚴格遵守。（二）停戰令下後，由三人會議立即協商，恢復全國交通之具體辦法，幷首先修復重要鐵路，（三）由三人會議定期商定全國及東北整軍復員之具體補充辦法，幷立即付諸實施。（四）由政府經協商定期重開政治協商會議，迅速解決改組政府保障人權，解救民生，完成統一等各項政治問題。上述四事，如荷贊同，請即分別提交三人會議及政協綜合小組協議施行，以安人心，以慰衆望。時危事急，特此建議，不勝迫切待命之至。敬頌公安，周恩來，董必武，葉劍英，吳玉章，陸定一，鄧頴超，李維漢謹啓卅五年六月廿一日。</p>
<p>周氏答記者問</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕中共代表周恩來，今日下午七時在梅園新村中共辦事處，舉行記者招待會，發表書面談話外，未作一字報吿。各記者曾向其提出詢問，經周分別答覆，茲略誌如次：（一）今日兩次會晤馬帥，乃在尋求今後八天內如何覓求迫切待解決的方法，三人會議可能於明日召開，並希望能獲得部份的成就。（二）關於政府提出之整軍方案的三個文件，屬於東北的，可以討論，屬於關內的，為一新的要求，中共拒絕討論，第三個文件乃是第一二兩個方案合起來而加以修改補充二月廿五日的整軍方案。（三）所有談判內容，亦即平日報章上所發表的，其內容要中共撤出熱河，察哈爾，烟台，哈爾濱，威海衛，駐在地為海拉爾，齊齊哈爾，延吉，中共無法接受此種條件。（四）關於馬歇爾「最後決定權」因政府代表的提議，是要求給美方代表以最後決定權，但中央宣傳部長彭學沛及中央日報則稱最後公斷權。今天彭氏在記者招待會上以及徐永昌來信，都說應以表決的方式以少數服從多數來決定，所以這是一新的問題。並稱，我們不贊成改變馬氏初到中國時所法定的「任何協議，均由三人同意一致通過，否則不能成立」。的辦法，（五）最近執行小組人員，雙方有被殺之事，雙方均在追究中。（六）關於恢復交通方案內之交通部派遣路警問題，周氏表示不願允許彼等進入「解放區」。末由鄧頴超報吿已接獲社會部洪次長函，謂時間迫切，不克出席在巴黎舉行之國際婦女民主聯合會招待會。至八時四十分散去。</p>
<h3>第三方面人士　昨與馬歇爾商談　馬帥希望國共互作最大讓步</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕今晨八時民盟代表張君勱，羅隆基，訪馬歇爾商談稍延停戰日期及馬使公斷權問題，並代達第三方面人士祈求和平之意見。聞馬使當時會而吿張羅云：和平談判，似有延續可能，惟國共雙方，尙須互作最大讓步，第三方面人士亦應就至公至正之立塲，促成和平，庶幾能由暫時休戰，獲得永久之和平。張羅以和平確未絕望，與馬使談約數十分鐘，遂欣然辭出。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕靑年黨，民主同盟，社會賢達，三方面政協代表張君勱，曾琦，莫德惠，陳啓天等十餘人，於廿一日下午三時，假藍家莊十五號開會，交換對當前局勢問題意見，僉對停戰期限延長，認為和平尙有希望。綜合渠等討論意見：（一）希望在延長停戰談判期內，即在卅日以前，對於停戰，恢復交通，及整編軍隊等方案，能獲致協議。（二）希望在各項問題獲得協議後，正式開始商談政治問題，然於未獲協議前，則由各方非正式交換意見。（三）停戰談判期間，三方代表願盡力促進談判之成功。今日會議中，並決定明日下午三時假歷史研究所，約請中共代表商談。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕靑年黨政協代表余家菊，宣傳部長左舜生，及民主同盟政協代表張君勱於今上下午及晚間，分別搭車去滬。</p>
<h3>和平談判能否成功　胥視中共之態度　白崇禧對外記者談話</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿一日電〕國防部部長白崇禧，本日單獨接見合衆社記者據稱：「在未來之八日中，和平談判能否成功，胥視共黨之態度而定，蓋政府方面業已作最大可能之讓步。」當詢及何為政府對共黨所作之最大讓步？渠答稱：「一月間政協所決定之政府方面之原則，業已放寬，國民黨業經推翻滿淸消滅軍閥，並逐出日本侵略者，在此種鬥爭完成後，吾人乃邀請中共參加以吾人努力所建立之政權。」記者問：「若談判決裂，是否即將發生戰爭。」渠答稱：「吾人從未想到戰爭，吾人希望和平。」渠繼就艾克遜關於訓練及裝配共軍之聲明，加以評論稱：「此種辦法，於和平談判成功後，始可實行，其目的僅在改編共軍為國軍。」渠最後稱：「政府方面業已根據協定，開始整編軍隊，惟共黨方面則未如此實行。」</p>

<h3>魯省共軍攻勢已過去　晉局勢漸趨嚴重　太原陷孤立絳縣被攻佔</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕記者今日與某軍事當局論魯晋情形，彼稱：山東共軍十三日第二次攻勢（即最近之攻勢）已過，繼之而來者仍為政治商談，此乃一貫作法，人謂陳毅與中共中央不完全契合，恐係表面看法。濟靑兩地增援兩個軍後，至少維持魯省現狀，可保無處，且共軍必須退出其於六月七日以後所攻佔之城市。山西最近之變化，殊堪注目，表面看來，似校山東為輕，實則尤重，蓋因共軍截斷同蒲路南段後太原大同兩要點，在戰略上已陷孤立，且山西地居中共腹地之側，兼以劉伯誠·賀龍·陳賡均有大軍混入，故較山東尤可慮也。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕十一戰區副參謀長呂文貞吿記者：十五天停戰期間，曾奉到蔣主席三次手令，飭與東北部隊相同嚴守停戰命令，縱遇共軍攻擊，亦只可止於自衛。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿一日電〕絳縣縣城於廿日下午被共軍攻陷，縣長陳子文受傷，一部突圍守軍，轉進至曲沃城郊。</p>
<p>〔合衆社靑島二十日電〕中國海軍於星期三破曉時、砲轟共軍佔領下之魯北煙臺及威海衛兩海口。據悉最近共軍等利用烟台及威海衛，作為開人東北之登陸地。據悉中國艦隊係星期一駛離靑島根據地，完成任務後，按照預定計劃駛回洋面，另遣登陸隊一隊攻佔渤海海間之長山羣島，切斷共軍以沙船運兵之路線。</p>

<p>〔中央社鄭州廿日電〕豫北修武南八公里之前後董村，原住博愛地方團隊百餘人，十二日晚突遭共軍三千餘襲擊，激戰二小時，我軍衆寡不敵，董村為共軍攻佔，十四日經我部派隊收復，十五日晚又遭共軍攻陷，當即報吿新鄉三人小組，十六日上午美代表白來格上校允前往董村，至十七日上午十一時共方代表黃鎭，託詞未獲報吿，眞相不明，允派共方參謀郭留赴焦作聯絡，郭當日下午返新，謂共軍太行第四分區司令員黃新友，定十八日赴修武南之范橋，與三人小糾會晤，當由白來格上校率領調查人員出發，惟臨時因乘車損壞，折返，十九日上午八時美方琴納中校，政府翻譯官郭子祺，與一總部駐小組聯絡官閔慶樞，會同共力代表黃鎭，前往董村，臨行時黃鎭忽稱疾不往，另派參謀郭黃隨往，同乘吉普車出發，途經獲嘉，我軍唐師長加派科長朱潤身陪往，上午十一時車至前董村附近，共軍守軍鳴槍射擊，郭子祺肺部當受重傷，閔慶樞腿部受傷，董即停止前駛，共方代表郭黃即赴村內接洽，結果共軍僅准美方琴納及郭黃入城，負傷之郭翻譯官子祺，閔聯絡官慶樞由朱科長潤身設法，送至修武救治，惟郭子祺以重傷旋即殞命，美方琴納等當晚即返新鄕。記者頃為此事走訪鄭州綏署負責人，據談共軍此種背信滅義行動，官兵異常憤慨，綏署最近保護共軍由鄂北運傷殘官兵過境，處處均予便利，而共軍對我參加小組人員，竟任意槍殺，舉凡共軍不欲小組執行任務之處，則扣留監視掃射狙擊，槍殺在所不惜，而需要小組調處之處，則强人聽從，視小組為其工具，如此種暴行，不加嚴懲，不僅無以對被殺殞命之國軍官員，此後小組當更難執行任務矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿日電〕新鄕小組政府方面郭子祺少校，在修武縣為共軍殺害，軍調部政府方面委員鄭介氏，於接獲該小組政府代表及美方代表所發郭少校等遇害之報吿後，極為震怒，已向葉劍英提出嚴重警吿，要求懲兇幷廢止此種非人道之恐怖殺人政策，否則政府人員若一再被害，而致，起其他不幸事件，均由共方負完全責任。按郭少校安徽人現年廿五歲，光華大學畢業，秉性直爽，富於責任感，抗戰期中，曾任軍委會外事局翻譯官，參加印緬作戰，成績卓著，勝利後由中央訓練團調平軍調部新聞處服務，曾赴太原，隨同小組出外調處，本年五月初船轉赴新鄉工作。氏為和平奔走，竟以身殉，此間各界人土，咸表痛惜。</p>
<h3>廿二小組人員　又被共軍扣留</h3>
<p>〔中央社鄭州二十日電〕廿二執行小組之無綫電台及工作人員，刻已被共軍扣留於宣化店，情形極為惡劣。中原共軍顯有不顧一切準備發動鬭爭之事實。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口二十日電〕新鄕小組政府方面組員郭子祺，在修武殉職事，已引起此間人士之極度注意，武漢小組今日整日開會，討論該小組人員今後安全問題，前定二十一日飛鄭之小組，已不擬如期出發。又赴宣化店小組亦暫緩啓行。</p>

<h3>繁盛口岸受戰爭影響　靑島成經濟空殼　共軍截斷交通綫對外貿易阻塞　人口激增糧食感缺乏物價奇昂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社靑島廿一日電〕靑島本為華北繁盛口岸，以外受戰爭影響，內因政治關係，已成為一經濟空殼，僅恃美國水兵及陸戰隊之金元，始得免於崩潰。靑島港口原由德人開發，戰爭期內被日軍佔領七載，後成為美國第七艦隊之基地，其名始復見於報章。最近又有共軍進攻之報，益受世人注意。今由東半島十分之九皆在共軍掌握，靑島市緣有山，共軍距市不足二十哩，將其交通綫截斷，因此欲與外界貿易，殊不可能。山東所產花生油，儲藏豐富，豆餅落花生堆積內地，靜待時局太平，運往靑島。當地紡織廠旣遭戰事摧殘，復因原料不給，以致市面凋敝，經濟能力，僅及戰前四分之一，而人口則已由戰前之五十六萬至七十六萬二千，內有自共軍佔領區域逃出之難民約九萬人。</p>
<p>紡織廠九家以前雇用男工人不下三萬名，今已滅至四千。各廠現為中國紡織公司經營，有紗錠六十餘萬枚，織機三萬架合計投資不下數百萬美元。麵粉廠家，因無小麥接濟，不能開工。通貨膨脹與投機猖獗，使其景象更為幽暗。市內華人多不獲一飽，而中立觀察家則稱其倉庫中堆存之粟米，高粱甜薯，小麥，煤斤，不下四萬噸之多，足供全市六個月食用。據市政官員謂倉庫存貨祗有七千噸，但其眞確數目姑置勿論，顯係有人操縱市價，上落不定，投機囤積者因而獲利不資。在本月十九日，一雙普通皮鞋需美金四十元，煤屑每噸售七十五元，男衣一襲需美金兩百廿元。市政府雖明令禁止抬價，而物價仍在繼長增高。政治衝突與武力戰爭，使靑島市而不能安定，聯合國善後救濟總署欲將救濟物資運往鄕間，深感苦痛。據聯總分區主任英人齊哈哲夫稱，汽車運輸本可不成問題，而百分之九十之人民，僅獲得接濟品百分之十。美國水兵與陸戰隊，在靑島出入酒樓舞場，任意揮霍，並有價値數百萬美元之工程，建築公署宿舍，使靑島市尚能保留一部份生機。惟中外感情，未能稱為融洽，旦不斷發生事故，路上行人，顯有仇視之意。最近共軍進攻靑島消息，各華報大書特書，以致人心皇皇，形勢殊為緊張，入夜在街行走，未免惴惴不安。美軍始終保持鎭靜待命，惟一部份人相信此雖為美軍外交手腕之試騐，而更大之試騐尚在其後。</p>
<h3>被服廠職員　挾巨款潛逃</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿一日電〕軍政部第六服廠，前曾派職員胡某，來杭提取鉅款，款已提去多日，廠中迄未見其返歸，現該廠已在嚴密調查中，聞該款總數約有一億元之譜。</p>

<h3>天大的喜訊！最後的機會！</h3>
<p>煌煌停戰令，原定今天正午期滿。大家昨天正在提心弔膽地向着和平有沒有希望的時候，國民政府主席終於下令延長期限八天了！以前命令各軍隊停止前進，攻擊，追擊的時效，延長至六月三十日正午為止了！這是天大的喜訊；這尤其是最後的機會！政府固然掬示了它最大誠意，共產黨也該不辜負這天大的喜訊。我們以為共產黨究竟是中國的共產黨，中共的黨員究竟同是黃帝的子孫，應當不再翻覆拖延，錯過了這一冷色最後的而又更大的機會了吧！</p>
<p>停戰十五天的期間，本來要談判先解決三件大事：（一）完全停止東北衝突；（二）完全恢復國內交通；（三）迅速實施軍隊復員及整編統編方案。但，談判了十五天的結果走卒，沒有不頭痛，沒有不心酸。戰不但不停，而且關外關內打勢愈兇；而談判復談判，舌敝唇焦，依然沒有結果！終至挨到期滿的前夕，不能不勞蔣主席痌　在抱的明斷，再來延長八天，給大家一個續談的最後機會。我們想，這些好戰份子怎麼對得起主席？怎麼對得起國家？怎麼對得起祖宗和子孫？</p>
<p>為國家，為人民，我們自然切望共產黨珍惜這八天，切莫再錯過這最後機會。即為共產黨的前途計，為共產黨的黨員留一個與國民相見的餘地計，也不該再錯過這一個最後機會了。中共嚴於組織，勇於行動，而又長於宣傳，所以要說過去十五天中各地共軍的突襲攻擊，乃是各地頭目的自由行動，而不是由於組織的秘密號令，誰也不敢相信。惟其如此，我們還是要向中共領袖呼籲：今天中國，內亂萬萬要不得！友邦希望我國和平，成為强大統一民主的中國；人民更莫不希望在和平的氛圍裏，完成建國復興的大業，打了八年的仗，人民熬苦也熬够了，為什麼還不讓大家透一口氣！然而停戰令雖下，談判雖進行，衝突却始終未能停止，什麼緣故？一言以蔽之，共產黨的策略似乎不希望談判成功而只是要「拖」。拖！拖！拖！拖到國家割裂，拖到民族衰頽，拖倒强大統一民主的中國永遠建不起來，拖得四萬萬五千萬同胞大家沒有飯吃，拖到有朝一日，他們心目中的「無產階級革命」可以爆發，而我們和我們的子孫有無顏面立足於世界，可以不聞不問。好一個偉大的「拖」字訣！中國垂危的病症，說不定要害在這「拖」字上。我們要喚醒同胞，約對不許共產黨在這延期的八天裏再玩「拖」的花樣！如再讓它拖，一定要拖到「喜訊」幻滅，拖到「機會」消失的！</p>
<p>我們為什麼知道中共還想要拖呢？只要看前天周恩來與馬歇爾特使談話後向報界發表的主張就可知道。他說：（一）不分關內關外，沒有時間限制，停止衝突，靜候調處；（二）國共爭端如若需要友邦調處，則須依照杜魯門總統於去年十二月十五日所發表對華政策的聲明及莫斯科三國外長會議所發表的公報辦理。這兩點好像很動聽，冠冕堂皇，其實他還是要中共傑作「拖」的花槍。第一，沒有時間限制，中共就可以邊談邊打，永無了局。第二，友邦調處，早成事實，而且出之於中共的願望和請求，何以今天回頭去重說「如若需要……」的「假定」話？可見他們有些不歡迎調處了。第三，調處和談判，要有結果，一定得談最具體的問題，現在撇開了停戰令限期內的三件大事不談，却拖出杜魯門聲明和莫斯科公報裏的原則來幹嗎？第四，杜魯門去年十二月十五日聲明，不外（一）美國政府希望有一强大統一民主之中國；（二）國共兩軍或其他雜色軍隊間的戰鬥必須停止；（三）召開代表各黨各派之全國會議，完成中國統一；（四）聯合國及美國只承認當今的國民政府為中華民國唯一合法政府，尤其在淸除中國境內日本勢力方面，與國民政府合作。此外美英蘇三國外長莫斯科會議的公告，關於中國者，也不過聲明三强遵守不干涉中國內政的政策，並同意美蘇兩國軍隊於任務完成後各自中國撤退而已。我們檢討半年來叛國的對華政策，完全依照上述各項原則，並不越雷池一步，而馬使所促成的談判，也無非要實現這些理想，與其此時來重提原則，何如趕緊認眞談判具體問題？即此可知中共還存心執行他們「拖」的政策而已。但是我們老百姓還能容許他們再拖知？</p>
<p>我們今天起，要十二萬分珍重這喜訊，愛惜這機會。我們得千萬誠意的感謝馬歇爾特使的不辭勞瘁，盡力調解。我們尤其感謝美國國務院向國會提出繼續軍事援華的法案，來達成下列兩項重大使命：（一）協助國共兩軍合併，實行整編統編方案；（二）發展一種有效力的力量，使安全理事會得藉以維持遠東和平。美國國這種協助，馬歇爾特使這樣調處，眞是中國每一人民所由衷感謝的！反對美軍駐華，以及不肯聽從馬歇爾特使的公斷，這些決不是中國人民的意見。總之，一剎那間，十五天已過去了！現在再延長八天，為時更短。這八天的一時一分一秒，都特別寳貴，應該好好珍愛。不讓它再蹉跎過去！政府代表要努力，中共代表更須努力，我們老百姓尤其要努力！</p>

<h3>埃及政府負責　保護赫賽尼</h3>
<p>英國定下週宣布　對巴勒期坦政策</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅二十日電〕埃總理薛特基頃發公報，申言埃及具有基於榮譽上之責任，以保護回敎主赫賽尼，並調人人均知埃及正處微妙之政治階段，希望能於和平及良好之秩序中達到其目的，赫賽尼當然對此亦深切了解。</p>

<h3>大批動物兩天島　供原子子彈試騐　將冒險經歷一次人為的靈難　作科學上各項研究</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿日電〕供七月一日試騐原子彈對軍艦威力用的一批動物，正由美海軍運輸艦「柏爾森」號載往比基尼地瑚島，計有白鼠四千只，山羊和豬各二百只，還有少數豚鼠和鼷鼠，此外另有一批微生物和昆蟲。這一批動物，正好像乘着諾亞的方舟，將冒險在洪水中經歷一次災難——一次人為的靈難。在比基尼試騐的前一天，牠們將分別放在廿二艘艦船之內，供試騐的艦船共有七十七艘，等第一彈爆炸之後，一俟人們可以安全地踏上試騐艦時，這批動物即馬上再被運回「柏爾森」號　　　和生物學家加以檢騐，以視原子彈的爆　　究竟有什麽影響。</p>
<p>「柏爾森」號這次　試騐而携帶的儀器和設備，其價値之昻貴和配備　　全，可以說是為任何艦船從來所未有。自動物的皮膚以至其體內細胞的極小部份，都作為試騐的對象。就連長在病　中的微生物和昆蟲，科學家也要把牠們撕開來看一個究員，　以確定核子幅射作用對牠們的遺傳機構，發生何種影響。其中一部份動物，要給牠們打痘苗，抗毒血淸，荷爾蒙及維他命，目的是要試騐原子光綫對抗毒的物質有無影響。有的山羊要把牠們的毛給剪短，使與人身上的毛長度一樣。這是要去考察究竟頭髮對於護腦和抵抗熱力，及其他種幅射作用有何價値。另有的山羊、要給牠塗上風光油膏，看其有無效力。</p>
<p>一百廿只白鼠是極容易生癌症的，那麽原子彈爆裂時，發出的光綫會不會使牠們生癌症呢？其餘如原子彈爆炸會不造成不孕現象，也可於受騐動物的性器官中獲得解答。試騐中還有另一緬極大的問題，就是原子彈爆裂對血液影響如何，白員將在這項試騐裏佔重要位置。每一只白鼠的血統，都經分別檢騐，歸入卡片紀錄。原子彈爆裂後，科學家就可知道牠們的血液，有何種變動，以及變動到何種程度。</p>
<p>這一枇動物，放在試騐艦上的時候，其位置將與海軍作戰時的位置相同，食米和水都可不用人管理而自動的供給牠們。在比基尼從事試騐工作的枓學家和技術人員大的有五十人。</p>
<p>賴依被邀參觀</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十日電〕今日宣布美政府業已邀請聯合國秘書畏賴依前往參觀此基尼島之原子彈試騐，請柬內說明此次試騐，並非聯合或國際性之試騐，純為　政府所單獨主持之科學試騐。</p>
<h3>管制原子能問題　美蘇可能成立協議　英對提案考慮中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十日電〕關於原子能管制問題，杜魯門總統頃向報界發表談話稱，美國與蘇聯刻正進行談判，可能成立協議。至蘇聯所提建議內容如何，杜魯門不願加以評論，但重行聲明，渠元全贊成美代表巴魯樞所提禁止使用原子彈一項建議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕蘇聯所提銷燬並禁止應用原子彈之建議，正由英政府考慮中。非官方之意見則大多表示反對，有謂此乃未具原子彈國家之意見，故對其未有損失祗有利益。同時亦有人指出原子彈既已產生，即使予以銷燬，亦不能使科學開倒車，或消滅一般之不安及疑懼心理。一般皆認蘇聯之簡單建議，似不宜施之於如此複雜之問題。英政府之原子委員會，現對該建議，正在考慮中，其意見當向聯合國機構提出。</p>
<h3>國際點滴</h3>

<h3>神奸巨蠹罪無可恕　梁逆鴻志判處死刑</h3>
<p>聞判面作苦笑冷汗盈額雙手微顫　不準當堂接見家屬婆媳嚎啕大哭</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕頭號傀儡元老漢奸梁鴻志，經高院審結，昨日下午宣吿判決。慕「名」而往作旁聽者，擠滿法庭。二時半，劉毓桂庭長偕曹駿邱煥瀛兩推事，戴榮鐸檢察官等準時升座，即飭法警提梁鴻志。此一代罪人遂於衆目昭彰下，押上堂來。梁衣細花藍綢長袍，下穿白綢褲，花條絲襪，足登白底黑緞鞋，站立於阻被告欄內，猶强作鎭靜。是時劉庭長手執判決書，雙目炯炯久久無語，而全體旁聽者亦皆屛息以待，此肅穆之法庭氣氛，與莊嚴之法官神態，似覺與往日有異。端坐旁聽之被吿家屬，神色頓顯緊張。劉庭長即於是時啓口對梁曰：「你的案子巳經審結，本院今日宣判」言畢即肅然起立，朗讀判決主文：「梁鴻志通謀敵國，爾謀反抗本國，處死刑，觀奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收」。讀畢又坐下對梁曰：「本案因為你犯罪事實重大，無可寬恕，故判處死刑，以張國法。你如有不服，可於接到判決書後十日內，向最高法院申請覆判」。站立於被告欄內之梁鴻志，當法官讀至判「處死刑」時，交叉於背後之雙手，頓起微顫，時捏時放，藍綢袍為之捏起甚多縐紋，臉部雖猶強作歡笑，然灰白之臉色，額部之汗珠與不自然之苦笑，未能。掩飾內心復雜之情緒。待法官言畢後，即掏出手帕拭面，並對法官要求，能否與家屬講幾句話？劉庭長當答「在監獄裏接見好了」，言畢退座，並令法警押回。是時梁之一妻一妾即起立緊隨於後，其媳在庭外失聲哭泣。梁本人則默然無語。梁為本市高院審奸判處死刑之第一人，但正式執行之期尙有待，須俟最高法院覆判後决定。（關於梁案判決書全文，兌本版角。）</p>

<h3>兩萬餘學生大遊行　反對內亂情緒激昂</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部軍法處，對於糧貸案之初少偵訊，已於二十日完竣，昨在整理核閱中，短期內即將開庭審判。記者昨晤軍法處長曾昭貽氏，詢及曾氏前日赴地檢處商談事，據稱，糧貸案仍將由軍法審判，汪達人昨日雖未及押還處，但將於日內與任星崖同提來處。又據記者探悉昨日地檢處備文迎提榮永明，警備司令部方面因榮案僅係抬高米價嫌疑，與糧貸無關，故未允移解。惟據地檢處吳檢察官語記者，糧貸案之處理，依照法律之規定，理應由法院全責受理，故是案現正由地檢處依照法定程序，全面偵査中。昨日因準備不及，未曾開庭偵訊。而該案主角汪達人，於前日上午偵訊前，吳檢察官即簽發「釋票」，擬於偵訊後移押警備部，至傍晚又簽發「押　」　將汪於五時左右押還　院看守所。改列為第一〇一五號囚犯，並戢論「停止接見。汪在獄頗自在，其家屬於昨日起，始探監送物。或將於廿四日上午三度偵査後，始移押至警備部云。</p>

<h3>洪門組黨未必成事實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨載洪門致公堂有改堂組黨之說，邇來外間確有此種傳言。但記者為探求眞相起見，昨日分訪與洪鬥有關之鄭子良·姜豪·王知本·陳培德·李永祥諸氏，據稱：自海外致公堂代表司徒美堂趙昱二氏來滬後，擬聯合國內洪門領袖，定於七月十五日召開洪門代表懇親大會則有之，至洪門組黨一事，並無所聞。更謂即若組黨，亦決不致以致公黨名義。代表海內外洪門各山堂，一體改堂（致公堂）為黨。蓋致公堂使為海外洪門之一單位，國內各地均另有堂名，本巿向無致公堂山口，而有一聯合性之洪門協會，成立於戰前。洪門先進向松坡，汪禹丞（已故），崔通俠·毛雲·與余等（鄭等自稱）均為發起人，在長江流域及華南華北，各地洪門山堂，均有密切聯繫。上週二該會曾舉行復員會議，到有山堂十八個單位，對於洪門組黨，一未提及，且各山主亦絕無此動機或企圖。洪門本有三大傳統信條，不願混入政治舞台，吾人（一）以義氣團結，（二）以忠誠救國，（三）以義俠除奸，在此三項信條之下，擁護政府，挽救民族危亡，站在民衆立塲，以盡吾人職責，故實無組黨之必要等語。是則外傳洪門致公堂改堂為黨，常僅係海外洪門中一部分人之擬議，未必能成為事實也。</p>

<h3>梁案判決書全文</h3>
<p>査梁逆為長樂人，六十四歲，住上海畢　路一五〇號，此次所延辯護之律師為章士釗，朱鴻儒·李國珍三氏，茲將本案判決書全文中之事實理由，探錄於後。</p>
<p>事實</p>
<p>梁鴻志曾任北京政府國務院參事，參議院議員，執政府秘書長等職，國府北伐成功，定都南京，被吿政治生涯遂吿中輟，迨中日戰事發生，京滬淪陷，日人謀設傀儡政權，以推行侵略政策，該進認此為彼　取權位之唯一機會，遂料同溫宗堯·陳錦濤·陳　等，向敵通款曲，與在滬敵酋謀議壽設華中偽政權，時距國府西遷纔及三月。淞滬抗戰之慘痛，赫然猶在人心目，國民誓與日寇不共戴天，乃被吿竟於廿七年三月二十八日，在南京成立偽維新政府，發表宣言，設置兩院八部，統轄三省兩巿。該　自任為行政院院長，總攬大權，改用五色國旗，主持議政會議，招募軍隊，以固敵軍後防，强佔海關，以裕偽方財政，公賣鴉片，以推行敵人毒化政策。並陸續與敵酋簽訂　路電信鹽務銀行協定，與敵合營華中鐵道電氣通信鹽業輪船等公司，及華興銀行，復迭次與華北偽臨時政府首領王　克敏，會商合併。以張聲勢。卒於二十匕年九月成立偽中華政府聯合委員會，被吿共同發表成立宣言；同年十一月問，東渡訪問敵方軍政首要人物，以資聯絡；　國後，發表訪日感想，滿紙逆詞；二十八年四月間，汪逆兆銘背叛黨國，潛來上海，　組偽國民政府，被吿鑒於汪逆獲敵奧援，自知聲勢不敵，遂與汪王二逆，數度磋商後，卽於同年九月廿一日及廿三日，先後以偽維新臨時兩政府名義，共同發表宣言，響應汪逆主張之和平運動。翌年一月間，復在靑島開會，共同決定組織偽中央政治會議；三月廿日，又開會於南京，議決中日關係調整案，及偽國民政府樹立火綱案，並發表偽國民政府各院部長人選。同月卅日，偽國民政府在首都正式成立，共同發表荒謬之還都宣言，及偽國府政綱；同時偽　新臨時兩政府宣吿解散，被吿改任偽監察院院長，兼偽中央政治委員會委員；至卅三年十一月廿日，偽立法院院長陳逆公博因汪逆病故，繼任偽國府主席，被吿接充偽立法院院長，曾修改偽法律多種，至日寇投降，始行去職來滬，經軍事委員會調査統計局駐滬辦事處解送本院檢察官偵查起訴。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本件被吿梁鴻志乘抗戰軍與，國軍西撤之際，在滬糾同溫宗堯·陳錦濤·陳　等勾結敵酋，籌設偽政權，卒於民國廿七年三月廿八日成立偽維新政府於首都，自任偽行政院院長，總攬軍政大權，變更國旗，招募軍隊，獲奪海關，公賣鴉片，並陸續與敵酋擅訂鐵道電信鹽務銀行協定，合營交通電氣鹽業金融各種公司，此項事實不獨迭在本院審理及偵査中自白不諱，並有調案之偽維新政院各院部職員表，特務機關卷，機要密件卷，華中電氣通信公司卷，華中通信軍事協定卷，中日條約周年紀念論文卷，宣傳文件卷內偽維新政府實錄，偽鐵道部外債借款卷，曁歷年「新聞報」，「申報年鑑」，新中國手册之紀載，足資印證，至其如何與偽臨時政府主席王　克敏會商組織偽中華政府聯合委員會，並發表宣言，如何東渡訪問敵方軍政首要人物，歸國後發表感想，如何響應汪逆兆銘之和平運動，參與樹立偽國民政府會議，如何參加偽國民政府，充任偽監察立法兩院院長，出席偽中央政治委員會議等情，亦據供述歷歷、復有査獲偽維新政府初周紀念册，和平及反共建國文獻，偽南京新報兩周紀念特刋之記載，曁偽臨時政府卷，及宣言卷，可資參證，是被吿</p>
<p>勾結敵寇反對抗戰　，至其所持辯解，無非謂（一）民國廿七年後，戰氛愈熾，民生益苦，被吿悲天憫人，遂有維新政府之組織，其目的在搶救陷區人民，保存國家元氣，其範圍不過一較大之維持會。至改用國旗籍以避免日軍干涉，設置綏靖軍，原為維持地方治安，設立禁烟局，係為制止日方經營鴉片，發行華興券，並未影響民生，征收稅款，僅足維持維新政府之開支。凡此種種，無非搶救人民，初無反抗本國之意。（二）關於鐵道電信鑒務銀行之協定，其性質為臨時，其內容並非利於敵人，乃係由敵人手中爭同一部權利，何能指為喪種辱國。（三）日軍圖於維新政府設立特工及統制糧米機構，經被吿堅拒不令施行，又南京之古物書籍，悉為日軍刧去，經被吿交涉返還，文化賴以保存。（四）對於汪兆銘之和平運動，誤認為中央一面抗戰，一面言和之方策，故未予反對。關於中政會議之議案，由汪逆宣讀，即行通過，被吿從不參加，即參加亦不發言、故不能負責。（五）被吿曾於廿九年輸　中央，密吿敵方機密，並營救政治工作人員出獄，勝利之後，被吿在先遣軍工作，維持京滬治安，亦不無微功；復於卅四年七月十五日，向調査統計局上海辦事處自首，請依法減免其刑，並舉證人薛大可曁呈案前孔院長祥熙曁陳蒙任援道曲荔齋之信件為證。（以上各款係綜合被吿方面口頭及書狀陳述之要點）關於第一點，按敵寇在淪陷區設立傀儡政府，原為達其</p>
<p>以華制華以戰養戰</p>
<p>之目的，被吿仰承敵寇意旨，組織偽維新政府，下設兩院八部，統轄三省二巿，總攬大權，發號施令，竊據華中，形成割據，此與由商民組織之維持會，逈不相侔，乃竟自比於維持會，顯屬不倫，至其招募匪軍，公賣鴉片，濫發偽幣、暴歛橫征、無一非禍國殃民，助長敵燄；乃猶自謂振救人民。保存元氣，尤屬顚倒是非。再就其歷次發表之宣　之，一則日：「焦土政策，等於自戕，容納共產，儼同召寇，是中國有史以來惟一之惡政府；」（見偽維新政府宣言）再則曰：「國民黨之政權，何止三分去二，消滅已在目前；」（武漢陷落發表談話）三則曰：「專橫誤國之黨政府、已失却人民信仰、陷於崩潰之時。」（南京淪陷周年發表談話）對於中央政府肆加詆毀。其偽維新政府政綱，復首揭于三權憲政，改用五色國旗，紊亂國憲，反叛政府，逆跡至為昭著。所謂並無反抗本國之意，顯屬　言。關於第二點，按維新政府原為敵人所卵巢之傀儡組織，其為敵人訂立協定，無非滑稽醜劇，內容如何，本無足辯，况核閱被吿曾以偽行政院長名義，與敵軍中支那派遣軍司令官山田乙三訂立關於華中通信之軍事上協定，其第一條載，軍司令官或艦隊司令長官，基於軍事上之必要，施行通信撿閱，且統制通信等語；（見偽交通部雜項類政字第四號卷）關於與敵方合辦鐵道，則訂稱在華中區域者，由維新政府與日方簽訂協定，創立華中鐵道公司，委託代管經營，如京滬滬杭蘇嘉等綫，皆屬之等路、（見偽交通部關於調整合辦鐵道公司之籌劃）關於航政，則有日本領導組織之由華輪船公司及上海內河輪船公司，先後經維新政府核准設立；（見偽交通部第一五七九號卷）此類協定內容，在軍事上政治上經濟上，均於敵方絕對有利，乃被吿　妄稱由敵人手中爭回權利利，尤屬悖謬欺飾。關於第三點，査維新政府期內，在其所轄上海西區極司非而路七十六號，巳有偽特工機關之設立，公然</p>
<p>殺人越貨橫行無忌</p>
<p>至米糧統制機構，彼時雖未設立，但敵軍在華中一帶，征收軍米，亦在在需偽政府為之協助以上兩事，所謂堅拒不令施行均難置信。至所稱向敵方索回南京書籍古物，縱令非無其事，然同在敵人勢力控制之下，即使索回，亦不啻取之內府，而藏之外府，有何保存之可言。關於第四點，査汪逆兆銘背黨叛國，擅發主和艷電，中區立予嚴斥，褫汪職位，除汪黨籍，舉國輿論，一致抨擊，當時報章均有刊載（見二十八年一月一日新聞報）被吿詎能有所誤信·再就偽維新政府聲明所述，「在精衛光生脫身渝府，一再發表和平救國之宣言，且願與海內賢達，商榷國是，吾人所翹首企足而未遽達此期望者，得汪先生挺身任之，中日永久之和平，不難實現」，及偽臨時維新聯合委員會聲明所稱：「根據本會成立之使命，願以全力協助汪精衛光生成立中央政府」等語觀之，則被吿對於汪逆之主和，豈特未予反對，抑且積極擁護，其為沆瀣一氣，已屬顯然。次査被吿歷任偽南京政府監察立法兩院院長、兼任偽中政會委員，曾與溫逆宗堯等，於廿九年十一月八日，在偽中政會第二十八次會議，公推注逆兆銘為偽國民政府主席，經決議通過，有偽政府公報　稽，乃自謂不參加會議，亦不發言。</p>
<p>諸事實適得其反</p>
<p>關於第五點，査被吿所稱：於廿九年心　中央，報吿機密，雖據證人薛大可到庭陳述，並提出前行政院孔院長之函件為證，但核閱該函，僅種據報吿（指薛大可報吿）曾與偽方首要梁君等密洽等語，是祗能證證明被吿曾與中央派員有所商洽，而不能證明其有何切實工作，自難認為協助抗戰。而曲荔齋函內所述董人　及吳千里經轉託梁衆異（即被吿）設法營救，得以先期出獄等語，即令實有其事，亦不過偶徇友人之請，代一二私人緩頰，尙不足語於有利人民之行為。至所稱在勝利後，維持京滬治安，不無微功一節，査其時先遣軍在京滬一帶工作，該被吿縱令從旁有所襄助，亦不過窮途末路，圖蓋前愆，尙無功續之可言，又被吿並未於犯罪發覺前自動投案，而受審判，核與刑法及漢奸自前條例中之規定不符，即使曾於卅四年七月十五日向軍統局以書面陳明經過事實，亦祗是自白，而不能認為自首，不能因此妄邀減免。綜觀上述各點，辯解純係飾詞。</p>
<p>圖卸罪責均無足採</p>
<p>按我國自敵寇發動八一三事變後、即以長期抗戰為國策、舉國上下悉力以赴，乃被吿於京滬甫行淪陷，即挺身而出，通敵謀叛，竊據南京，僭稱政府，變更國旗，擅簽協定，淆惑國際觀聽，動搖民衆心理，實屬甘冒天下之不　。迨汪逆兆銘背叛中樞，發表　電，被吿復勾結王逆克陂響應利運，羣奸集議，另組偽府，仍舊厠身要職，始終不去，祗圖一巳之勢位，舉凡國家主權民族命脈悉置之不顧，且其率先叛國，作汪逆　竊之前驅，倡亂華中，與冀察羣奸相策應，神奸巨蠹，罕有比倫。自非處以極刑，不足以昭烱戒，而彰國法。全部財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，併予沒收。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條·第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項·第九條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第二十八條，第五十七條，第三十七條第一項，判決如主文。本案經本院檢察官戴榮　蒞庭執行職務。中華民國三十五年六月二十一日，上海高等法院刑事庭審判長推事劉毓桂，推本曹駿，推事邱煥瀛。</p>

<h3>尊師西畫義展　形形色色顯現出時代精神　機會難再尊師的最後一幕</h3>
<p>尊師國畫義賣之後，接着又有西畫義展，昨天起在新生活俱樂部開幕了。記者是愛好藝術，同時又很同情於尊師運動的人，在不十分炎熱的上午，驟車至威海衛路俱樂部去參觀。在相當寬廠的二樓「節約廳」上，掛得又整齊，又參差的一百多幅畫，繽紛地現在眼前，眞如山陰道上，應接不暇！開頭就看見一幅四十吋大小的油薑，金啓靜的「江干送別」，富於詩意的畫題，眞够耐人尋味。這裏有靑山綠水，有半凋零的梅花數樹，在風中搖戞，頗近國畫的作風，可是半途的小汽船，正在升火疾行，這又充分的表示了時代精神，和國畫裏常見的風帆片片不同了，下面貼深紅的條十，知道這五十萬元的大作，已經被「朱先生」定去了。</p>
<p>其次，記者視線向左右各方面移去，蕭淑芳的水彩「睡兒」，奔放的筆觸，配合着粗淡簡單的色彩，驟然看來，和油畫一樣地渾厚。鄭定裕的油畫風景，深深的密林外，襯茄一泓秋水，顯示着新古典主義的作風忠實，和他另一幅靜物，同樣是他的力作。王通的水彩「黃浦江」「百老匯大樓」兩幀，色調和輪廓，都很準確，前者是江潮汹湧，土黃色的江水，正在前進；後者是高聳的大廈，　立在鐵橋後面，十分刻板的建築物，運用了水和彩來表現描寫，能到如此生動活潑，是不容易的。</p>
<p>十年以前的洋畫老作家，大都轉變了，向國畫方面去努力，這地，很少他們的作品，只剩顏文樑一個了。顏先生純粹是古典主義作家，他的傑作「廚房」和「陸稿荐」，大家還記憶得起來吧！這次他有三幀，都是描寫江南蘇錫一帶的風景，有雪景，有月色，有春天，雖然巧小精緻，却費了很大功力，定價又非常便宜，在顏光生也許是為了尊師起見，求其普遍的意思。張充仁是新進作家之中，第一流畫家。就他的出品講，可說是件件精品，尤其是風景之中，「顧家花園」一幀，色彩非常調利，筆觸是沈着而有力，靜物中「花」「野味」等，佈景是深暗的，畫面上顯得格外强烈有力，確是傑構，丁光　似乎和顏文樑同一作風，精細而溫和，好樣春天，好樣和風，五十吋大幅油景，介紹江南水鄉的酣密溫柔，配着十分精美鏡框，使人神往！使人玩未！標價二十餘萬元，未免太便宜了。</p>
<p>劉滄旭，陳致通，李詠森，李宗津等，都有極精的力作陳列。周碧初的風景小幅，蔚藍色的天空，　蕩着幾片薄薄的秋雲，金黃和嫩綠色的地面，充分表現初秋景色的美好可愛！劉獅只有兩幀素描人體，輕鬆流利，毫不吃力，聽說他在個展之後，剛巧生病，所以沒有力作出現，也是一個美中不足。女作家韓安義周如瑛，出品中很多獨特的長處，可惜記者記不淸楚，不能一一介紹了。</p>
<p>最後，記者以為　　師西畫展，是此次尊師運動會的最後一種活動了，空前，也是絕後，再不致有第二次尊師運動會了，希望愛好藝術而同情於敎師生活困苦的社會人士，多多提倡，多多協助，使這西畫展有更良好的收獲！更圓滿的結果！（甫池，三十五，六，二十一，於上海）</p>

<h3>艾契遜演詞全文　軍事上繼續援華　邁向有秩序的和平世界</h3>
<p>美代理國務卿艾契遜，十九日在衆院外委會就軍事援助中國問題，發表演詞，梗概已載昨報，茲錄全文如次，藉供各方參考。</p>
<p>余今日在此，將略述H·R·六七九五議案，該議案將規定對中華民國之軍事協助與顧問，目下日本旣已戰收，中國經八年苦戰之後，必須再度着手於國內之重建與復興。但戰爭之終止，尙未解決中國之一切問題，由於受敵人數年之佔領與戰事之損失，中國政府當前主要問題之一，為恢復國內之秩序及遣送日本投降時留在中國之大批日軍，中國必須努力解決此一問題，並迅速設法腹行在聯合國憲章下對於保持和平之義務。自租借法案通過以來，中國軍隊已獲得美國之供應與配備，並由美國軍事使團加以訓練。中國藉此能繼續作戰，尤因中國軍隊使用吾人之技術與供應，而對於戰爭之努力更見進步。在呈交國會之第二十二條報吿中，關於租借之活動，內稱自對日勝利日至一九四六年二月，供給中國之物資，計值六萬萬美元，余以為在此考慮對中國繼續協助之議案時，不妨約略檢討本國對協助中國抵抗日本侵略所作之努力。此為吾人足以自豪之故事，亦足以說明如果此種合作能繼續下去，則對於世界和平，將有極大之利益。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍現在中國企圖使中國各集團為和平之利益而共趨一致。渠已有不少進步，故吾人必須繼續供給馬歇爾將軍所認為必要之協助，務使中國與吾人在聯合國憲章下，共同向有秩序之世辦邁步前進。珍珠港事件發生前不久，第一批租借材料已運入中國，陸軍部並派麥克魯准將協助中國利用此等材料，數月後史迪威將軍代替麥克魯之職，並徇蔣委員長之請，史迪威將軍抵華後不久，即被委任為蔣委員長之參謀長。此時「駝峯」上空之飛行已開始，中國軍隊近五師，每師一萬至一萬二千人，空運至印度，該處有一訓練中心設立在拉姆加爾地方。該處之訓練包括步兵，砲兵，裝甲兵，信號隊及運輸隊。中國軍隊在緬甸之訓練，證明非常成功，因此史迪威將軍在中國發起所謂「三十九師計劃」，其後由魏德邁將軍繼續進行，彼時為中國危急之時期。華軍由沿海岸及華中主要工業區步步被迫後退，當時美國即派軍官赴華，並在昆明設立訓練中心，在該處開始類似在拉姆加爾所施之訓練。在戰爭初期領導著名飛虎隊之陳納德少將，重行加入美國陸軍服務，受命赴華協助訓練中國空軍，訓練昆明「Y隊」工作，亦同時進行。陳納德將軍除訓練中國空軍外，同時並繼續予華中各地作戰之中國陸軍以有效之梳護。中國訓練計劃所需之一切洪應品，以及吾人所能供給前　華軍之供應品，均須由運　機載之越過一駝峯」，飛過喜馬拉　山上空「危險」之航綫，其往來之頻，與效力之大，令人驚異。但軍火與其他配備終於運抵中國，而中國軍隊獲得此等接濟後，士氣大振。供給華軍之一切配備，均根據租借法案。戰爭結束後，華軍仍需額外之配備與供應，以便有效執行佔領區之收復工作。因此，杜魯門總統延長對華之租借供應，直至一九四六年三月卅一日。本年初發覺華軍收復區之工作至三月卅一日尙不克究成，因此總統再度延長對華租借之期限至一九四六年六月卅日。屆時租借法案之權力即吿滿期，此為本委員會所知者，而吾人將不能　續作供給配備之協定。中國必須在日軍仍在移動之地區維持陝序，而中國政府必須依賴配備充足之軍隊，方能履行其對自己人民及聯合國憲章下之義務。今次所加之立法，即基此理由。國務院獲得海陸軍部之擁護、已請求立法規定對華之顧問與協助。</p>
<h3>中國軍隊　亟應歸併統一</h3>
<p>馬歇爾將軍認為中國各軍事部隊亟應歸併為一，此為馬歇爾將軍工作之主要目標。渠現正為謀取各項錯綜複雜問題之解決而工你，吾人亦　　　將獲得完滿　果。共軍將為無黨派國家軍隊之一部分，惟迄今共軍仍無充足之組織，訓鍊及配備。是以共軍領袖曾要求（馬拉爾將軍亦巳同意）於整軍前領受短期之美化訓練及最低數量之配備，未來數月間，任何有關此項決定之協助，對　軍計劃均將有所貢獻。吾人之工作與極龐大之軍隊有關。中國國軍實力約有三百師，每師人數在一萬至一萬二千名間，據最近估計，共軍之實力亦相當於國軍四分之一·解決種種有關問題及進行整軍工作雷要相當權限。諸位所考慮中之法案即將產生此項　限。按照馬歇爾將軍所建議之整軍計劃，此一廳大軍隊之人數將大大减少，整編後之軍隊，且將為受過優良訓練之平時軍隊，其實力毋將合於吾人之理想，馬歇爾將軍之建議如獲實行，吾人如仍　續履行馬歇爾將軍建議之吾人應書之義務，中國將有一前此未有强有力戰鬥組織。此項戰鬥組織，並將配合平時中國之需求。整軍工作獲致極大之成果：庸大之人力將因之得以從事重建收復區，善後農事以適應對付飢饉之殷切需求，龐大之人力將轉為發展中國工業之用，中國政府亦將因而節省維持龐大及組織不良軍隊之靡費，在整軍工作完成前，中國政府將無著有成效及秩序之行政之希望，著有成效及秩序行政為中國阻遏通貨膨脹之風及善後工作必具之條件，</p>
<h3>完成諾言　助建軍事機構</h3>
<p>馬歇爾將軍所提出之大綱中最要部分，　為遣派軍事顧問代表　至中國。數月前蔣委員長巳有此種請求，此為大綱之心　，現正在請求關於此項大綱之權力。聯合參謀部與國務院會商之後，巳為此軍事顧問　擬定一種計劃，業經總統予以批准，總統按照其緊急權力，曾指示我人曰：顧問　之組　應屬暫時性質，但無另加之法規，而該團之存在年限，亦未經確定。因此，在此種情形下，極為需要之長距　計劃，將無法擬定。目前軍事顧問代表團將包括美陸軍人員七百五十人及海軍人員二百五十人。馬帥認為此一千人將可助其協向　施關於促使中國軍隊現代化之計劃，並決定中國軍隊應有供給品及配備之數量。</p>
<p>本人現必須鄭重言明：對於便利馬帥執行其計劃，國務院具有極大之關切。</p>
<p>此項提議應儘速使其成為法案，本人深信此點極為需要，且對美國亦極有利。此項措施，將可促使美政府完成去年十二月十五日總統所作之諾言，即協助中國建立軍事機構，務使該國力能負担有關維持和平與秩序方面之國家及國際責任。　如總統在該項宣言中所稱：一個無組織及分裂之中國，對於世界安定與和平，乃係一種破壞之力量，且將引起對其本身問題之外來干涉。在另一方面，一個訓練有素及獲有充分配備之相當數量的和平軍隊（如馬帥在其軍事調整計劃中所建議者），對於由　將有極大之裨益，此不僅係　和平與消弭內亂而已，且將促使中國完成其在聯合國憲章中所應負之義務。（美國新聞處，華盛頓，十九日電。）</p>

<h3>市立學校收留額費</h3>
<p>編輯先生：小女在市立第一女中讀書，日前回家，謂校長報吿，凡下學期預備來校續學各生，每人須繳留額費五千元，且限於兩日內繳納，不繳作自動退學論云云。鄙人為一小公務員，雖　無餘錢，但因小女催逼甚急，又恐其失去求學機會，不得不向戚友處吿貸五千元，為繳付。査收取學生留額費，原係上海私立學校歛錢方法之一，市立學校旣不收學費，則該校此次向學生收取留額費，且其數又達五千元之多，不知有何根據？事前曾否經敎育行政局核准？謹代表貧寒家長向敎育行政當局呼籲，希望切實澈査制止。邵錦之啓。六，十九。</p>
<p>蘭州黃河岸的水車　（劍虬攝寄）</p>
<h3>蘭州的潛流</h3>
<p>— 郭劍虬</p>
<p>十三日蘭州航訊</p>
<p>當來自漢　格里的大砂風停止了吼叫，小小的一座城垣，從風砂中顯露出來。黃河岸上的白楊和梨樹，也都綠沉沉的了。人們知道邊地的春天已經逝去。當深山的杜鵑用牠最後的一節輓歌送走了春天，牡丹的最後一片殘瓣也就跟着凋落了。隨着而來的，就是炎炎的夏日和纍纍的瓜菓了。</p>
<p>蘭州的夏天在哪裏呢？在黃河兩岸上。</p>
<p>你看：河岸上成羣的水軍的巨輪，隨着夏日河水的滾滾洪流，又開始它們的工作了。自從邊地的冬日過早的來臨，它們幾儸月來在做着一個多麽悠畏的夢啊！　它夢見黃河在寒風凛冽中化成一道銀龍，然後凍僵在大地上沒有聲息。岸上的人民瑟縮地蜷伏在窰洞中，在破爛不堪的泥土小屋裏，忍受着冬天的暴虐，為了燃燒馬糞取煖造成的强烈的焦臭，籠罩着城巿和鄕村。當然，達官巨商和保甲長們家中那擦得掙亮的白銅炭火爐和滾燙的白乾酒的香氣，它也常常夢得到，但牠又有什麽法子呢？當那條凍僵了的銀龍，在初夏的陽光中重新復活，重新奔流歌唱的時候，它也好重新開始它的勞作了。它們歌唱着，讓汗珠兒在四面飛散着，把河中的水，汲到高高的堤岸上，讓它們汨汨地流過沙岸，流過田　。讓那些在寒風中瑟縮了一冬的農人們，在他們卵石壘的瓜田或麥田上，展開一片命色的希望。</p>
<p>但，蘭州的夏天又不祗停留在郊外。在城市裏，在大街上，在頭頂小白帽大聲吆喝的老回回的冰淇淋店中，在那些混血姑娘們的壯健的裸腿上，在皮裘的喇嘛們袒露的左臂上，也都可以看見夏天的足跡。</p>
<p>當地報紙上說今年蘭州的夏天，有着十二年來所沒有的高熱。但外來人並不能感覺到，當他們回想起　日的夏天，在重慶的蒸籠似的竹樓上，在蒸發着熱氣的秦淮河畔，那些呑着冰揮着扇，而仍舊汙如雨下的日子，在蘭州是幸福的，灤宅巨廈中室內的溫度也不過在攝氏二十度左右。價廉的天然冰每天送到家中。上海灘上大批湧到的罐頭水菓和本地的葡萄汁，經過冰鎮，也都是消夏的妙品，而且，再過一兩個月，那使蘭州榮膺水菓城的雅號的醉瓜，大西風，水蜜桃，大蘋果和花紅，也都可以上市了。</p>
<p>蘭州的夏天是平靜而並不酷熱的。但他却有着別緻的邊地粗獷的作風，比如在平靜的炎陽中偶然上來一塊黑雲，頃刻之間也許可以遮滿半個天空，跟着狂風起來了，　砂捫着你的口鼻不能呼吸，也許夾雜着洒來幾個大雨點，乒乒乓乓窗紙全破了，假如還有電子、那就小心腦袋吧。但不用擔心，也許十分鐘，也許廿分鍍，一切都會成為過去，仍然是風和日曖好天氣。</p>
<p>天時如此，人事亦然。比如說你正平平靜靜的過着日子，忽然消息來了，說是奸匪一股由甘寗邊區向河西竄來了；不然就是水登發現火批騎馬的回匪了；再不然華家嶺的土匪又出來了，少乘十汽車吧。</p>
<p>但這些都不能影響那都不能影響那些經常在開展中的邊　建設工作。全國一律的夏季時間早已實行，但這裏的工作時間絲毫不受影響，而且好像更形緊張了。你看：在工程師節更有開發邊彊重任的工程師們，剛剛開完一個大會，科學工作者協會又跟着成立了。科學敎育館的電化敎育說是已經大規模的展開，行營政治部的電影話劇隊也準備向磽瘠的戈壁灘上行進，什麽祁連山調查隊，地質調査隊啦，水力發電勘測隊啦，靑新公路測量隊啦，天蘭鐵路臨洮支綫測量隊啦，蘭州到迪化的　銅話線安裝隊啦，全向四方八面出發工作去了。蘭州大學積極籌辦，而且還要增設工學院，當局正在設法延聘敎授。</p>
<p>但這一切的努力不能挽救一個頹勢的潛流，這潛流包括兩股：一股是這勝利難的工業凋敝的洪流，一股是龍海通　後那些由沿海爬上來的難民，義民，塞外淘金客、故家重建者們的向東滾滾而下的人流。這兩收潛流滙成一個大的洪流，現刻正在這磽瘡枯燥的的黃土高原上冲刷着，激　着。假如沒有適當的措置來矯正它，分化它，也許會像每年夏季的西北公路一樣，將會給巨股的山洪冲刷成一段段的了。（六月十三日於蘭州）</p>

<h3>收回香港</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「寗願和光棍打架，不願和無賴講話。」光棍打架，一拳一脚，誰輸誰贏，括落鬆脆，乾乾凈凈；無賴講話，瞎七搭八，歪橫　夾，拖泥帶水，一味胡扯。我們中國人之看美英兩國，大概有這麽一種分別。</p>
<p>住過香港的人，對於那地方，氣候，等等，可以說無不滿意，尤其是冬季；但統治者的殖民地政策，誰也不敢領敎。</p>
<p>過去的舊賬不去談，以抗戰勝利之後而論，屛山機場事件，香港當局依然保持着大英帝國的臉嘴，使我們已非當憤慨！而這次的國民日報停刋事件，更是變本加厲，簡直荒謬。我們絕對難以忍耐，我們現在堅決地提出一個口號來，「收回香港九龍」。</p>
<p>香港九龍的租借期限，本已滿期，在卅三年廢除不平等條約的時候，為了並肩作戰的關係，這個問題沒有得到解決，在我們眞是不勝遺憾的是；在英國，老實不客氣地說，那是無恥！那是無賴！</p>
<p>馬可福音十二章中說：</p>
<p>「你們要防備文士，他們好穿長衣遊行，喜愛人在街市上問他們的安，又喜愛會堂裏的高位，筵席上的首座。他們侵呑寡婦的家產，假意作很長的禱吿。這些人要受更重的刑罰。」</p>
<p>英國在這次戰爭中，已受到他所應受的懲罰，請問，今日的英國，在歐洲，在近東，甚至在印度，還有什麽値得搭起惡覇架子的理由；在香港，他能隨心所欲，擺主人的威勢，蔑視我法令，侮辱我政府，奴隸我人民嗎？呸！</p>
<p>沒有任何談判可進行，乾脆地一句話收回。至於那些包庇漢奸的壞蛋，不管他是哪國人，拘捕了再處分。</p>
<h3>美國國會議員難做</h3>
<p>— 川虬</p>
<p>選民每天來信達六萬封　盪衣服拾石子都要當差</p>
<p>美國下院四百三十五位和上院九十六位的男女議員們，各有不同的嗜好和習慣，可是每天早晨十時左右，他們差不多都幹同一的工作，就是閱信。國會議員們，或許在委員會議缺席，投票表決時不作表示，或是開會時不到，但他們都要拆閱他們的函</p>
<p>郵信在平時每天須送四次到國會裏，星期六及休假日减為兩次，平均每天郵信約六萬件。有位議員回憶四十年前，他的老太爺那時也在國會，雇書記一人相帮答復一切來信。今日每一議員，都要雇用文書三人至四人，纔克應付。當一九〇七年時候，來自中西部某一大城的議員，平均每天收到十二信。可是到了一九四六年，雖則該城人口已見减少，而寄給他們議員老爺的信，總有一百二十五封一天。</p>
<p>大約在每五封信之中，內有四封是詢問或贊助某項事件。每一議員的工作，往往給奇異的請求引起興趣。有一女子來信，要求送給她若十普渡梅克河的石子，以增益她的收藏。又有一位選民，探知他的兒子即將從軍隊中退伍回到華盛頓，於是寫信給他　出的　員說，他巳有兩套衣服寄出，請這位　員老爺　他　　好，懸在公事房中，預備他的愛子到達時交給他！</p>
<p>但是，實際說來，國會議員所收到的信件就大體論，對於他們的供獻價値是很偉大的。沒有議員能够周知這許多提案的內容和利弊，不少個人以及　美國大學女子協會，經濟建設協會等等團體，都把各　問題作詳細硏究，因此他們的函件，理由充足，非常有助於　員們的思慮。不過議員們是處於兩面的地位，他不但在華盛頓代表他的本州，更須在他的本州代表華盛頓。例如去年十二月，來自埃來白島的下議員史百克曼，接到本州許多來信，表示對於軍隊復員的普遍不滿，以及反對普及軍訓。史百克曼原是國會軍事委員會委員。他所知道的事實，當然要比他的選民多。於　　聖誕節返里之便，特把這些問題，舉行四次講演，終於使全州民衆的觀感，為之丕變。如果史百克曼單只把本州選民來信所提供的意見，作為投票表決與否的標準，這事粗看起來，果然是民主了，但是他所做的工作，乃是包含代表政府在內，也即是兩面工作，而不是單方面的。（譯自美國自由雜誌）</p>
<h3>怕死與愛錢</h3>
<p>— 川虬</p>
<p>一位倫敦人，在愛丁堡上火車，與一位面色憂　的蘇格蘭老者並坐。車抵第一站，他的同伴急急下車，奔至月台，然後再急奔而回，氣喘不已。第二站，第三站，也是如此。等到第三站過後，倫敦人不禁好奇心起，請問其故。蘇格蘭老者答道：「我去倫敦，請一位專門醫師替我診治的心臟，他說很壞，如果我不好生保重，隨時有性命之憂，所以我回去一站一的買車站票啊！」</p>
<h3>病中吟</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>我似乎與病有不可分離的關係。少時旣已病來消磨過去的歲月，而這八九年來，更從病中帶來了不少悠長的，幾非人所能嘗味的酸楚和殘酷（我不敢說是戰爭給與我的）。這酸楚與殘酷曾經給我破了家，餓着肚子，死了人，跑傷了足踝。更有一個較長的時間是拿兩枝銅子一塊的麵餅來充饑，一日祇有財力吃下那麽的兩塊，便算一日裏面的早晚兩餐。然而幸還未致去啃草根，嚼樹葉，算來已是「得天獨厚」了。可是身子就因此益發不濟起來，病也長此相與纏綿，老是互相廝守，亘共晨昏，妻子也沒有它這麽深厚的情致。但，為了這個特別多情的傢伙病，可能使我得到的是一種「文園消渴」的削伐確然有個時期連那每日兩塊麵餅的代價也無力去找了。尤其，我永不能忘懷的是某一次更因而暈厥起來，倒在一條山道的峭壁之下氣息僅屬，心靈像飄上在搖曳着的樹梢，又好似人是已經得道了，蕩乎靑冥，意至飛逸。祗苦了這具臭皮囊，還倒在峭壁之下氣息僅屬而巳。</p>
<p>幸而雖與病結不解之　，自己着實也早已鍊就一個金鋼不壞之體。這點兒的小磨折難為不了我許多。不久病便暫時與我吿別，其實並不是吿別，祗在內裏潛藏罷了。然而，在我，却很喜歡它有道麼一下暫短的潛藏，不致去找麵餅時為了它而在體力上有較多的費勁。於是我又有了我自己認為舒服的日子過着了寫上幾百個字，換上一點比麵餅還要豐當的口糧，而脚上穿了底的那雙僅有的皮鞋呢，自然，也可以有力量補綴得恍如新製了。</p>
<p>這樣的過了好些舒服的日子，跟妻子不在跟前一樣，又悠閑，又舒適。可是，妻子本來「不是寃家不對頭」，病總與我有着這一世的孽緣，難解難分地。</p>
<p>今日又病起來了，本人的意思祇是昨晚受了凉，同時又多寫了幾百個字，精神過於耗損。便在早上起來已覺頭重脚輕，扒起床來又迫而倒下床去。我是不大相信郞中的，不管他是西醫或者中醫。其實現代的藥物也醫不了我的病，因為它與我有上這一段孽緣，在孽緣未了之時，病就是我的不可愛而偏棄不掉的愛人，而它對於我那種可怕的情致呢，便是非要我形神消滅不可了。</p>
<p>然而，道許是說得過份嚴重罷。一點小傷風，那値得這麽的大驚小怪？不過，話得說回來了，一個絕對沒有甚麽較好營養的人，病對於他不僅是。「腐骨之蛆」了！但，這在我是不會引起甚麼的。橫竪是慣了，讓他長遠在病的裏面也可以來得淸靜些。至少，對於世事踧踖的感情，便不會打到我的心上。祗可惜麵餅會因此發生問題，要不然，我眞願意關上門來，窮年累月的病下去呢！</p>

<h3>掛綠荔枝　每斤十萬元</h3>
<p>廣東增城酉圓庵掛綠荔枝樹兩顆，其產品為　朝貢品，「世界聞名」，戰前價格每枚易數百斤，淪陷時日軍以之「貢獻日皇」及各地「高級將領」，今年出產僅七斤半，每斤價十萬元，每枚五千元，當果實未熟前，即已「掛號」沽淸，後至者出價十五萬亦不可得。値此湖廣飢荒聲中，亦一具有諷刺性之小對照也。</p>
<p>又果品中芒果一項，雖以呂宋出產者為上品，惟番禺夏茅芒果，其名貴之處巿上，呂宋貨每隻售價約千元之　，而夏茅芒則售至四五千元，且載以錦盒，陳諸飭擠，頗有一登　門身價百倍之　。雖然如此，但仍供不應求，於此又有誰敢相信：廣州市上，，有　　路上者四五十人耶！</p>

<p>據成都報載：「某　　一雇員，最近有三日未上辦公　，亦未請假假第四日辦公時，主管問他，答覆是：「無錢買米，三日未曾吃飯，妻哭子啼，如何來辦公。今日方自友人處借來七百元買燒餅果腹」，言下泣不可仰。此亦可當作哀鴻一例看。</p>

<h3>肉賤如糞土</h3>
<p>— 芳艸</p>
<p>肉類食品，在今日人們的眼中，那是一個多麽富有魅力的東西！中下階級大都有「三月不知肉味」之嘆。原因自然是肉價的貴不可言，現在每兩的肉價，相等於戰前每兩的金價，可說：「肉貴如黃金」</p>
<p>但是宋代黃州的猪肉，價賤如糞土，跟今日猪仔的身價相比，眞是天差地遠！不信，請讀下面蘇東坡的「食猪肉詩：」</p>
<p>「黃州好猪肉，價賤如糞土，富者不肯吃，貧者不解煮。慢着火，少著水，火候足時他自美。每日起來打一碗，飽得自家君莫愛。」</p>
<p>這樣賤的猪肉，却沒有人要吃，眞是咄咄怪事。祗有蘇東坡才每天把它常點心吃。他叫你「莫愛」，恐怕你却禁不住要垂涎三尺了！</p>

<p>（一）白仲勳問　我與某女　愛三年餘，情感頗為投合，而遭其父不滿，從中時加阻碍，破壞我倆感情，但雙方意志反更趨堅定，視其父决難有同意之日，今我倆均可自謀生活，如在婚禮時無主婚人，是否合法？如必需主婚人，是否可請友人代理？代理者對其父負有罪名否？舉行婚禮時是否可不通知其家庭？在簡單之下　成合法婚　之手續為何？敬請賜予公開指示，感恩無涯。</p>

<p>（二）周達問　我有一位女友，雙方感情已到固結不解程度，但是彼是一個已經結婚過四個月而喪夫的寡　，而且是在鄕下舊式家庭，我有幾個難題，靖　先生有以敎我：（一）喪失已　二載，其夫婦關係是否隨之而消滅，抑尙在繼續狀態中？（二）在未將庚帖拔出，即行嫁人，於法律有不合處否？翁姑大人可否據此為藉口，出而干涉？（三）鄉下習俗，寡　再　，必須拔出庚帖費，此項費用，是否正常？（四）採取何種步驟最為合法，而且簡捷？</p>
<p>〔律師傳況鱗答〕（一）其夫死亡，而婚姻關係即歸消滅，迄今已逾六個月，依民法第九百八十七條之規定，再行結婚，並無不合。（二）如該婦實足年齡已滿二十歲與人結婚，翁姑不得干涉，至庚帖拔出與否，並無關係。（三）拔出庚帖費，不能認為正當。（四）如與之結婚屬有公開之儀式及二人以一之證人。</p>
<p>（三）凌　問　鄙人於民國卅年間在會樂里娶一女子，迄今已有五載，平日情感甚好，且生有男女各一，但不料於去幾勝利後，由鄉間返滬，態度突變，時常在外留宿，不思家庭已有丈夫與孩子，屢次勸告不聽，而且自作主張，乘鄙人不在上海，密赴原處重操舊業，現　發覺，反　鄙人提起離異。查平日鄙人待　尙好，且伊之母親妹等均係由鄙人扶養，她今年才念餘歲，定有人背後　使或　人誘惑，請問該處鴇母有否引　　疑？鄙人為名譽起見，不願任她再操此種無恥生涯，以免妨碍鄙人之前途。此後如再勸告不聽，擬送入濟良所感化，或如何處置？請賜示。</p>
<p>〔傅况　答〕査該女如非台端正式配偶，僅為家屬關係，旣已滿二十歲，該鴇母即不構成引誘之罪。若為台端名譽計，惟有放棄已往之情感，與之脫離關係而已。</p>

<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>自從黃河成了國防的最前線之後，北岸的老百姓就像冬防期間被劃在警戒區以外的不幸者。性命財產好像懸掛在十字街頭，究全失去了保障，雖然在中條山南麓的若干山村裏也還有軍隊，警察縣長，以及一個懸城裏應有的各種機構，各種人員，可是那些人也像那些老百姓一樣可憐，整天整晚在耽着心事。</p>
<p>然而多難正可興邦，往往在極端惡劣的環境中，倒會開出理想的花朶來，這一羣像孤縣在海外的島民，為了本身的安全，反而形成了軍民之間的密切合作，較其他戰區合作得更好。</p>
<p>並非為了想得勛章，也不是企圖政府的褒揚。不過為了自己，為了自己的鄉土，大家在盡心竭力的防禦敵人的侵襲，甚至想進一步的設法消滅敵人的威脅。祗要有機會，每個老百姓都愿意上前線去，殺死幾個鬼子。可是鬼子在那裏呢？他們藏在裝着鋼甲的飛機中，飛得高高的，在天上逞雄。在沒有防空設備的黃河兩岸的上空由他如何猖在。炸彈，機關槍，他能打到我，我沒有法子打到他。</p>
<p>鬼子鬼子！就這樣鬼鬼祟祟。利用優勢的武器，攻擊無抵抗的老百姓。這種作風，實在算不得英雄好漢！</p>
<p>樊增果，是晋南平陸縣金沙灘上的一個靑年農民，他生長在河邊，工作花中條山麓的田間。一向主張為人要公道，光明磊落，抱着人不犯我我不犯人的主張。他所看見的，所接近的也都是一羣誠實坦白的農民。對於鬼子這種殘暴的侵略，固然深惡痛絕、對於鬼子這種不公道的戰術，尤其覺得義憤塡膺。</p>
<p>「那一天，天爺爺長眼睛，叫他摔下一架來，俺非親手把那駕駛員擒了咬他三口。」當他蹲在山坳裏躱警報的時候，常常望着天上忽高忽低到處亂飛的敵機，狼狠的發着誓，可是天爺爺偏不長眼，從米沒有摔過一架下來。飛得再低，也沒有被樹梢或電桿木摑住過。眞是可恨！</p>
<p>「喂！老李！剛才那架飛機飛得那樣低，你為什麼不給他一槍呢？」</p>
<p>樊增果氣憤憤地向二十碼外担任職望哨的保安團二營六連的上等兵李名興說。</p>
<p>李名興哼了一聲道：</p>
<p>「你瞧着低，沒有看見飛得多快！步槍要是打得到他，人家早就把他打下來了。」</p>
<p>「嚇唬嚇唬他也是好的呀！要不然，明兒來得更低，翅膀都快挨着你的帽了！」</p>
<p>眞是！打不到他，給他個警吿，出出悶氣也是好的。</p>
<p>第二天下午，警報又來了！五架，轟轟隆隆！滿山滿谷像五頭禿頭鷹似的亂飛。</p>
<p>「老李！幹！那架灰白色的最低。等他再飛過來時給他一顆衛生丸嚐嚐。」</p>
<p>「好！」李名興在對面崗上伏着身子輕輕地再往上爬起一點，倚在一顆樹椿後面，把槍柄托在胸口，槍口對準了天空。</p>
<p>「砰！」</p>
<p>飛機依舊飛着，顯然沒有打中。</p>
<p>「砰！砰！」別處也在發槍。</p>
<p>「各各各各！」飛機上機麓槍響了。可惹了禍了！趕快躲進窰洞去。</p>
<p>好一陣子過去，飛機聲漸漸遠去。樊增果從窰洞裏鑽出來向四面一望，忽然瞧見金沙灘上停着一架飛機。</p>
<p>「哈哈！果眞呌打中了！」他顧不得呌喊，一竄就下了山崗，直奔金沙灘來。</p>
<p>灘上停着的，確是一架三菱式攻擊機。號碼是三〇六。駑駛員山田淸少尉和大森淸藏軍曹正在惶急地檢査機件。機件沒有毛病，油箱也沒有漏，祗是螺旋漿少了半塊。怎麽辦呢？山田淸暴燥地跥着脚，大森淸藏還想試着起飛。</p>
<p>「不成了！不成了！別躭誤功夫吧！趕快把機關槍卸下！一回兒中國人圍上來，咱們可都完了！」山田淸一面把地圖收在口袋裏，一面喊。</p>
<p>「這架飛機怎麽辦呢？呌中幽人拿去，換上一只螺旋漿，還是好好的一架呢！」大森淸藏搓着手，幾乎想哭出來。</p>
<p>「少嚕囌吧！夥計！逃命要緊！我先走了！正北，翻過中條山就得救了！」山田清說罷便提着手槍怱忽的往山崗上奔去。正好遇到樊增果從山崗上下來。可是樊增果已瞧見那鬼子手裏提着傢伙，要是迎面上去，準呌他一槍做了。於是他閃在路邊，不讓他瞧見。那山田淸路旣不熟悉，心裏又慌張，祗圖上了山，找個隱蔽地方躲一躱。却不料華容道上偏偏遇見了關公。猛可裏從後而將他攔腰帶　忘命的一抱，結結實實的抱在懷裏，同時開始大叫起來：</p>
<p>「捉陂呀！大家快來從賊呀！」</p>
<p>山田淸本來就心驚膽戰，如在虎口。猛不防在山窮水盡之時又遇到了伏兵。自分死多活少，倒也不想生還了。忽又聽到擒他的人還在狼嗥似的直呌，這呌聲雖然聽着可怕，却也證明了對方是一個並無作戰經　，也沒有同伴，沒有武器的老百姓，於是重又燃起了他萬一的希望，他開始　扎，爭取他的手槍，可是手槍被樊增果抱住了。任憑山田淸像　蛟似的拚命掙扎，樊增果祗是虎容易縱虎難的敎訓，所以無論如何，她得使出原始的力氣和他揮　。而山田清呢？更是抱着最後的希望，使盡了所有的力量，，想掙　對方的掌　。</p>
<p>兩　人在山　　扭着，打着。叫哥，叫聲傳到金沙　上，大森淸藏也看見了。他看見自已的長官巳被老虎　在嘴裏，便　不得拆卸機槍，要來救人。祗是那架稍加修理即可使用的飛機，不甘心送給他的敵敵人。於是他在正要拔脚來救山田淸的時候，掏出手槍，對準油箱拍拍地打了一排，子，汽油着火，飛機熊熊地燃燒了起米。然後他再奔上山岡來救山田淸。</p>
<p>那時，李名興和其他老百姓也發現樊增果在山坳裏赤手擒虎的塲面，都想過來帮他。但，中間隔着一條溝，一時趕不攏來。倒被大森淸載先趕到了，走在樊增果背後，用手槍對準了他的後腦瓜子，打算一槍結果他的性命。可是一扣，不　！再扣，又不　。仔細一看，槍膛裏空空，原來這傻瓜把子彈一齊打在飛機油箱裏去了。</p>
<p>李名興看見對方有了帮手，料想樊增果會吃虧，更急着帶奔連跳的爬過崗來。不料正在這時，剛才回去的四架飛機又飛回來了，轟轟隆隆地沿着黃河來回飛着——顯然是在找他們的同伴。大森淸藏地招着手，拚命喊着、可是那四隻呆鳥轉了兩個圈子也沒有發見他們三個人在山坳裏打架。祗看到金沙灘上火光熊熊，以為他們已壯烈殉國，便回頭向西北飛去了。</p>
<p>大森淸藏一見救兵遠去，李名興又快到跟前，祗得再向樊增果加緊攻擊。手槍來不及裝子，祗能用槍柄打着樊增果的腦袋。鐵桿擊着皮肉，一下一個窟隆，一擊一股　血，痛！不用說，當然痛。可是越痛越不能放，做實焊焊住了的　　，愈打愈緊。</p>
<p>這時，李名興也趕到了。別的山崗上的哨兵，　寨，縣長，連長，副官，都先後趕到了。大森法藏看到形勢不對，祗好丟了樊增果和山田淸，獨自逃生，因為三面都有敵人，祇能向黃河邊逃去，他想泅水過河嗎？不！他根本沒有思考，沒有計劃，祗是本能的想逃走。係一頭貓似的盲目地逃走。</p>
<p>黃河愈到中流水愈急，沙泥裏住了腿，提步也困難。正象徵了他的命運，前途是渺無希望了。然而火森淸藏還在掙扎着向無希望的河中前進。</p>
<p>「砰！」一個巡官給他小腿上打了一槍。這才使他停止了妄想。</p>
<p>這邊，山田淸也被李名興從　增果的掌握中救出來了。</p>
<p>縣長指揮着警察，將這兩位天上掉下來的俘虜用　子綑起，樊增果，由兩個警察架着一同進城。</p>
<p>城門口擠滿了看熱鬧的娘兒們，大家要看樊增果，樊增果成了戲劇中的武松。不過武松打的是一條虎，樊增果擒的是兩頭狼。狼垂首跟在後面。樊增果頭上還在冒着燦爛的鮮血。</p>
<p>「英雄！」</p>
<p>縣長翹着大拇指得意地向看熱鬧的老百姓誇獎。老百姓也點頭讚許：</p>
<p>「好小子！眞英雄！」</p>
<h3>夢故鄕</h3>
<p>— 悱村</p>
<p>夜來夢故鄕。是依然那高高的松山。綠樹林裏幾隻嚙草的白羊；由脚村道上，凉寧裏的土地公婆在對歇脚的農民微笑，這微笑裏該有多少感慨：「少者壯而壯者老，而老者呢？」路旁是一片桑田，從桑樹隙縫可以　約望見那條載着小舟竹筏的活溪，看！太陽下蜜光魚潑刺翻身的耀眼的銀色！河對岸是金黃的沙灘，橋下埠頭，蹲着淘米洗衣的誰家姑娘呵，當心頑童丟一塊石子在你身旁時的一聲「冬」，水花濺濕你的黑褲白短衫，沙灘盡頭又是廣　的桑田，後面隱隱浮着炊烟的便是浣衣女的家鄉，頑童的家鄕，我的家鄕！</p>
<p>是那樣的親切，然而却又似乎是這麼的疏生。當我怯怯的踏進他的懷抱的時候，那來來往往的竟沒有一個是我的熟人。無非是小別六七載呵，又不是小少離家老大　！我滿腔熱情奔進最熟識的才康公公家裏，這兒終於見到我所熟稔的人了：才康公公，芝大叔，　娣姑……全在。我幾乎要上去擁抱他們，吿訴她們這此幾年我對他們有多少惦念。奇怪的是他們全冷冷的，就像五分鐘前才見過我一樣。我走向才康公公，我說：「公公，我回來了。」他看看我的葡長衫，說：「你沒有發財麽？我們章村人出門的那一側不發了大財？」我問：「聽說婆婆已經過世了？」他唔了一聲：「你也沒有做官？讀書讀到大學畢業不做官？」看見我羞紅的臉，他咬着旱烟管走開了。</p>
<p>於是我伸手向芝大叔。我說：「我們再坳一次手勁罷，像從前同在小學時那麼的。」然而他也看看我的長衫，輕篾地說：「你除了動動筆還有什麼力量？告訴你，現在不再是長衫萬能的時候了，我的拳頭我的鋤頭才眞是新世界的創造者。」我乞　的眼光　向　娣姑，我希望從她得到此　曾經得到過的柔撫，然而　在默默垂淚。</p>
<p>「　，奉姑，你為什麼傷心？讓我再拉次胡琴，你再唱隻歌罷。」</p>
<p>「誰還有這閒心思？」　斜睨了我一眼：「米要六萬一石啦，桑葉又貴，我們章村人是靠絲綢吃的，但絲綢偏偏賣不起錢。看來我們是只有餓死的了，荷荷荷荷。」她就荷荷荷荷地哭泣起來了。</p>
<p>我懷着怨望醒來，正是這大都市沈沈睡去的時候。連最後一擔餛飩擔子也挑回睡去了，遺留給人間的是黑暗，靜寂和噩夢。夜別一片無際的汪洋，我覺得我的身子在浮起來，浮起來，漂流開去，如一瓣被棄的枯黃的菜葉。</p>
<h3>夜行人</h3>
<p>— 藍弋</p>
<p>夜行人，跣了他的足踝，永遠向黑暗的世界裏邁進。</p>
<p>沒有一盞紙燈在他的手裏，沒有一個親人跟在他身後；孤獨的身影永遠只讓向己淌着血的足踐踏着。</p>
<p>沒有誰　使他，然而他要走；沒有誰侖令他，然而他要走。在他的飽　了　　而堅定的心裏永遠地孕育着一蘊希望：他要走出這黑暗的世界。</p>
<p>從這塊泥土，到那塊泥土！從這頂小橋，到那頂小　；從這個鄕村到那個鄕村；從這個省城到那個省城；他走遍了人間，也認識了人間；光陰在他的　間偸偸地溜過。多少年代了？他只知道自己紅潤潤的臉頰已變成乾　而醜陋，輕易的希望已變成堅苦的煩惱，而多少鮮紅的靑春的血液巳凝結在堅冷的泥土內。</p>
<p>他認識：這人間是黑暗的，是自私的，是自暴自棄的；正像這沒有月亮沒有星星的黑夜。但是他得不盡地向前走，雖然面前的黑暗橫裏着一條河流，一座高山，可是他要走，他要走出這黑暗的世界。</p>
<p>他知道，黑暗終有盡頭，前途有無限的光明。勇敢，一定走出這黑暗的世界。</p>
<p>他熟稔：這黑暗裏的一切。樹林裏的夜鴟是一個刻薄的詩人，他叫出了人問最悲哀的呻吟；池沼畔的流螢是一盞最有希望的明燈，牠加强了夜行人意志的堅毅；村舍裏的黃狗是一個最勢利的小人，他刻畫了這世界裏得勢的强人；天邊的一剎那的流星是人生的縮影，牠喚醒了沉緬不醒的人；而黑暗裏撼人的暴風雨，却是這世界整似最可怕的原形。</p>
<p>但是，他仍是走，用自己理智的脚步向）黑暗裏　進。　夜行人，更勇敢些吧！讓我們在黎明的曙光裏拉着手會集現在，且讓我們各自孤獨地向黑暗裏走吧。</p>

<h3>我懷念着上海</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>近來我常常懷念着上海，已經八年了，我被一輛雲飛汽車從呂班路載到北火車站，經過一重重難關，一批批檢査，才在日本兵的槍柄鐵棒底下，跨上一列擁擠不堪的火車。於是高聳的洋房，光滑的柏油路，蜿蜒如蛇的電車軌，……都在我眼前消失了。</p>
<p>我記得，我在上海的時候，曾深深地恨過上海。我恨那個小如鴿棚的亭子問，見不到陽光，吹不到涼風，整年整月，只有數不淸的臭虫，在無限制地繁殖，在吮吸人們的膏血。</p>
<p>可是我也深灤地愛過上海。我愛那條悠靜的霞飛路。我愛法國公園中的噴泉，噴泉旁邊紫色的小花。我歡喜獨自站在黃昏的路燈下，看着許多打扮得嬌豔誘人的上海小姐，我不羨慕，也不咒詛，只是默默地看着她們。</p>
<p>在上海，我注意過坐在黑牌汽車中的大亨，便便大腹，金鏈鑽戒，我也注意過縮在小弄堂裏的癟三，骨瘦似柴，滿身瘡疥，於是我記起了聖經裏財主和拉撒路的故事，我不為大亨慶幸，也不為癟三嘆息。我知道，一轉瞬間，天地要翻身，上海要翻身，大亨癟三都要翻身。</p>
<p>上海，像一架小小的雲梯，曾把我載到過天堂的門口；也像一輛可怕的鬼車，把我推到過地獄的邊緣。然而我旣沒有福氣進大堂，更沒有勇氣下地獄，我只能帶着一個疲憊的身體，悄悄地走了。</p>
<p>我走了，那是一九三八年十一月二十六日，天下着雨、我心裏想：以後我也許不會再來到這個地方。</p>
<p>可是我自己也不明白，近來，我忽然常常懷念着上海，似乎有一點依戀，有一點惆悵，有一點說不出來的矛盾的情緖。</p>

<p>「小紅！小紅！怎麽啦？」寶鈴驚惶地一面喊着，一面連忙去扶起她。</p>
<p>天哪！原來巳經凍餒」的皮肉，是不能驟然接　　的東西。如今，小紅的兩隻脚，十個指頭全像刀切的一般，脫了骨節，掉下來了！一盆水立刻變成了一盆血！</p>
<p>實鈴起初看見小紅昏厥，以為她是氣得太很的原故，及至看見她的兩隻脚成了這種樣子，他簡　　慌了。想抱她出去，怕老　娘更說閒話，自己又走不開，沒法子只好呌着：</p>
<p>「廖老　！廖老　！」</p>
<p>呌了一陣子沒有動靜，寶鈴使拉開了嗓子用力大聲喊起來：</p>
<p>「救命呀！救命！」</p>
<p>這麽一來，廖老闆來了，老劇娘來了，廖棟也來了。小紅已經醒了！</p>
<p>「怎麼回事？」廖老　看見那種情形，驚訝地問寶鈴。</p>
<p>「小紅的脚凍了，想着用熱水洗洗好取點兒　，哪知道一放進盆裏，就成了這個樣子子。」寶鈴說着，狠狠看了老闆娘一眼。</p>
<p>「奇怪，剛才還好好的呀！只怕是水太熱，燙的吧？」老闆娘裝作關心地說。想把責任推到寶鈴身上。</p>
<p>「哪個　凍成這個樣子呢？凍了的皮肉原不能用火烤，用水燙的啥！」廖老　着急得直搔頭。</p>
<p>「她下半天——」寶鈴還沒有說完。</p>

<p>「是的！只有在外頭才會凍成這個樣子。」寶鈴故意地重複了一句。</p>
<p>他們的話，小紅全聽見了，她也不願把實情講出來。讓廖老　和老闆娘生氣，她更不便代寶鈴申辯，那不是他的過錯。她痛苦地呻吟着，臉色越發蒼白了，心臟弱得幾乎停止了跳動。</p>
<p>「快把　抬到屋裏床上去躺着吧！」廖老闆向老闆娘說。一面吩咐廖棟：「棟兒，去叫李師父秤二兩米　，熬點湯給她喝。還有　把「雲南白藥」拿一瓶來先給她敷上。」</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Officially Announces Eight-Day Extension of Ceasefire Order; Three-Person Meeting Possible Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang of the National Government formally announced the following on the 21st: To give the Chinese Communist Party a greater opportunity to achieve a complete resolution regarding the cessation of military conflict, the restoration of transportation, the reorganization of the army, and army stationing, I have previously ordered the front-line commanders to extend the effective period of the order to cease advancing, attacking, and pursuing until noon on June 30th of this year.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The fate of the peace negotiations, which could be continued or broken off, was decided today. At 2:00 PM this afternoon, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda, issued a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters at the Ministry of Propaganda building: "To demonstrate the government's utmost sincerity and forbearance, it has been decided to extend the order to cease advancing and pursuing for eight days. The Chairman of the National Government has ordered that the order for all armies to cease advancing and pursuing should be extended until noon on June 30th of this year. During this period, an agreement on the cessation of conflict, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of the army must be completed. Considering the long-term suffering of the people, it must be resolved quickly and without delay. There can be no further delays in the future."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 2:17 PM today, shortly after Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei read the government's public announcement of the extension of the ceasefire deadline, he received a regular call from the Office of the Chairman of the National Government. About five minutes later, he formally announced the order of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, which he had heard on the phone, resulting in many foreign reporters not being able to obtain the content of Chairman Chiang's explicit order at that time.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 9:00 AM this morning, Marshall visited Chairman Chiang for an hour. After Marshall left and returned to his residence, he invited Zhou Enlai by phone. Zhou then visited Marshall at 11:00 AM and talked for about half an hour, thus realizing the final hope for extending the ceasefire deadline by eight days.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] It is reported that a new plan for restoring transportation may be agreed upon after one or two more rounds of negotiations. The crux of the current peace negotiations remains the reorganization and unification of the army. This issue will be raised by the Military Three-Person Committee for formal discussion. According to Zhou Enlai's public statement today, this meeting may be held tomorrow. Qualified observers say that if the CCP agrees to the government's new proposal regarding Marshall's arbitration authority, it could be held at any time.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Discusses Content of Negotiations; Adds Item of Political Issues; Hopes CCP Will Discuss With Sincerity</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] On the evening of the 21st, reporters visited the spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department regarding the letter from the CCP representatives to the government representatives, seeking their opinion. The spokesperson said: "This afternoon, after the Chairman announced the extension of the ceasefire, the government representatives received a letter from the CCP, which also advocated continuing the ceasefire and continuing negotiations, but without a negotiation deadline. In addition to the three items proposed by the Chairman in the ceasefire order: cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and army reorganization and demobilization, a fourth item was added: 'The government, through consultation, will periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference to quickly resolve various political issues such as the reorganization of the government, protection of human rights, relief of people's livelihood, and completion of unification.' This fourth item is indeed important, but the resolutions of the Consultative Conference regarding the reorganization of the government failed to be implemented due to unexpected complications created by the CCP. The government has implemented measures for the protection of human rights and continues to strengthen them, but it is hoped that the CCP area will also improve slightly, so that the one area of northern Jiangsu will not have more than three million refugees fleeing, wandering and suffering beyond description. As for how the people's livelihood has not been relieved and how unification has not been completed, the CCP knows this very well. Putting these empty topics aside, like spreading nets everywhere, according to past negotiation experiences, it will take months and years, and the distance will become further and further. Therefore, the government advocates distinguishing between urgency and importance, and first deciding and implementing the three most urgent issues. Which of these different opinions is better? It is hoped that the millions of refugees in northern Jiangsu can answer immediately without thinking. Fortunately, General Zhou Enlai declared that he would strive to address the government's proposal to resolve the three urgent issues by the end of the month. It is hoped that the CCP will truly open up, be sincere, and earnestly discuss, so that the three issues can be resolved within eight days."</p>
<h3>Patriotic League of Northeast Students Parades in Nanjing, Shouting Slogans</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] More than a hundred members of the Patriotic League of Northeast Students paraded in Nanjing this morning, calling for peace and shouting slogans such as "Northeast cannot tolerate chaos," "Military orders must be unified," "Sovereignty must be complete," and "Strive for peaceful nation-building." They also distributed letters to compatriots across the country along the way, their emotions were extremely agitated, and the citizens were quite moved.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Authority; Decided by Majority</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] It is learned that the government has made some explanations regarding the arbitration authority. The procedure for handling issues in the future Three-Person Committee and the Executive Headquarters will be determined by majority vote (Majority Vote) instead of unanimous vote (UnanimouoVote), that is, the agreement of a majority of two out of three people is sufficient to make a decision.</p>
<h3>CCP Submits Four Proposals in a Letter; Government Representatives Forward to Chairman</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Zhou Enlai made the following statement regarding the government's decision to extend the Northeast ceasefire to June 30th: "We have always advocated a long-term ceasefire for the military conflict in the Northeast. Today, on the expiration of the fifteen-day ceasefire period, the CCP delegation has submitted a proposal based on the instructions of the CCP Central Committee, and further requested Chairman Chiang and government representatives to immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast in order to negotiate all issues. Now that the government has announced the extension of the validity period of the order to cease offensive advances, troop movements, and pursuits in the Northeast until June 30th due to the efforts of all parties and the calls of the people, although this is far from our proposal, we will spare no effort as long as there is a glimmer of hope for peace. Therefore, as long as the government troops abide by the government's orders and cease attacking our troops, I dare to guarantee that our troops will firmly defend their original positions so that both sides can seek a long-term ceasefire and realize peace with the assistance of General Marshall." In addition, the CCP delegation sent a letter to Chairman Chiang and government representatives today, the original text of which is as follows: "Sirs Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Xueting, Lizi, Lifu, and Lisheng, and please forward it to Chairman Chiang for his perusal. Since the Northeast ceasefire, the hearts of the people across the country and world public opinion have all yearned for our two parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to obtain a unanimous agreement on the three issues of transportation, ceasefire, and army reorganization in the Northeast during these fifteen days through the joint efforts of General Marshall, so that the temporary ceasefire can become a long-term ceasefire, so as to reopen the door to peace and unity. Unfortunately, after fifteen days of efforts by all parties, the army reorganization plan proposed by the government was completely unexpected, attempting to exclude the CCP troops from large cities and railway lines during the army reorganization period in order to eliminate them, and insisting on the final decision-making power of the US delegation in the tripartite agreement to ensure the implementation of this plan. Under such circumstances, our side is really hard to consider, and the government's preparations for troop movements and war are becoming increasingly urgent, and the great fire of civil war has a tendency to break out and be difficult to control. At this critical juncture, if the ceasefire is not immediately stopped, then the people will be in dire straits, the country will be ruined, and the future is unthinkable. Now, upon receiving the instructions from our Party Central Committee, based on the current domestic and foreign situation, the will of the people across the country believes that only a swift ceasefire and the realization of peace can save the current serious crisis, rescue compatriots from fire and water. Therefore, we hereby formally propose to your side to implement the following steps: (1) The Three-Person Committee shall immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast and reiterate the national ceasefire order, stipulating specific measures to stop all military conflicts, and ordering the troops of both sides to strictly abide by them. (2) After the ceasefire order is issued, the Three-Person Committee shall immediately negotiate specific measures to restore national transportation, and first repair important railways. (3) The Three-Person Committee shall periodically discuss and determine specific supplementary measures for national and Northeast army reorganization and demobilization, and immediately implement them. (4) The government, through consultation, shall periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference to quickly resolve various political issues such as the reorganization of the government, protection of human rights, relief of people's livelihood, and completion of unification. If the above four matters are agreed to, please submit them to the Three-Person Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Small Group for discussion and implementation, so as to reassure the people and console the public expectation. In this critical and urgent situation, we hereby make this proposal, and we await your orders with utmost urgency. With respect, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, June 21st, 1946."</p>
<p>Zhou's Answers to Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] CCP representative Zhou Enlai held a press conference at the CCP office in Meiyuan New Village at 7:00 PM today. In addition to issuing a written statement, he did not make a single word of report. Reporters asked him questions, and Zhou answered them separately. The following is a brief summary: (1) The two meetings with Marshall today were to seek ways to urgently solve problems in the next eight days. The Three-Person Committee may be convened tomorrow, and it is hoped that some achievements can be made. (2) The three documents related to the army reorganization plan proposed by the government, the one related to the Northeast can be discussed, the one related to Guannei is a new requirement, and the CCP refuses to discuss it. The third document is a combination of the first two plans, with modifications and supplements to the February 25th army reorganization plan. (3) All the content of the negotiations is the same as what has been published in the newspapers on weekdays. The content is that the CCP should withdraw from Rehe, Chahar, Yantai, Harbin, Weihaiwei, and be stationed in Hailar, Qiqihar, and Yanji. The CCP cannot accept these conditions. (4) Regarding Marshall's "final decision-making power," the government representative's proposal is to give the US representative the final decision-making power, but Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and the Central Daily News stated that it was the final arbitration power. Today, Peng said at the press conference and Xu Yongchang wrote in a letter that it should be decided by voting, with the minority obeying the majority. So this is a new issue. He also said, "We do not agree with changing Marshall's original method when he first arrived in China, which was 'any agreement must be unanimously approved by all three parties, otherwise it cannot be established.'" (5) Recently, there have been killings of personnel from both sides in the Executive Headquarters, and both sides are investigating. (6) Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Transportation dispatching road police in the plan to restore transportation, Zhou said that he was unwilling to allow them to enter the "Liberated Areas." Finally, Deng Yingchao reported that she had received a letter from Vice Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, saying that time was pressing and she could not attend the reception of the International Women's Democratic Federation held in Paris. The meeting adjourned at 8:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Figures Consulted With Marshall Yesterday; Marshall Hopes the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Will Make the Greatest Concessions to Each Other</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 8:00 AM this morning, Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji, representatives of the Democratic League, visited Marshall to discuss the issue of extending the ceasefire date and Marshall's arbitration authority, and conveyed the opinions of third-party figures seeking peace. It is reported that Marshall told Zhang and Luo at the time: "Peace negotiations seem to have a possibility of continuing, but the Kuomintang and the Communist Party still need to make the greatest concessions to each other. Third-party figures should also promote peace from the most impartial and fair standpoint, so that a permanent peace can be obtained from a temporary ceasefire." Zhang and Luo believed that peace was not hopeless, and after talking with Marshall for several tens of minutes, they gladly left.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Youth Party, Democratic League, and social notables, Political Consultative Conference representatives Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Mo Dehui, Chen Qitian, and more than ten others, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st at No. 15 Lanjiagang to exchange views on the current situation. They all believed that the extension of the ceasefire deadline meant that there was still hope for peace. The gist of their discussions was: (1) It is hoped that within the extended ceasefire negotiation period, i.e., before the 30th, an agreement can be reached on the ceasefire, the restoration of transportation, and the army reorganization plan. (2) It is hoped that after agreements are reached on all issues, formal discussions on political issues will begin, but before agreements are reached, the parties will informally exchange views. (3) During the ceasefire negotiations, the three-party representatives are willing to do their best to promote the success of the negotiations. At today's meeting, it was also decided to invite CCP representatives to discuss at the Institute of History at 3:00 PM tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Success of Peace Negotiations Depends on the Attitude of the CCP; Bai Chongxi's Remarks to Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi met with Associated Press reporters alone today. He claimed: "The success of peace negotiations in the next eight days depends on the attitude of the Communist Party, because the government has already made the greatest possible concessions." When asked what was the greatest concession the government had made to the Communist Party? He replied: "The government's principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference in January have been relaxed. The Kuomintang has overthrown the Manchu Qing dynasty, eliminated the warlords, and expelled the Japanese invaders. After completing these struggles, we invited the Communist Party to participate in the regime established by our efforts." The reporter asked: "If the negotiations break down, will war break out?" He replied: "We have never thought of war. We hope for peace." He then commented on Acheson's statement on training and equipping the Communist army: "This method can only be implemented after the peace negotiations are successful. The purpose is only to reorganize the Communist army into the National Army." He finally said: "The government has already started reorganizing the army according to the agreement, but the Communist Party has not done so."</p>

<h3>Communist Army Offensive in Shandong Province Has Passed; Situation in Shanxi Gradually Becomes Serious; Taiyuan is Isolated, Jiang County is Captured</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A reporter discussed the situation in Shandong and Shanxi with a certain military authority today. He said: "The second offensive of the Shandong Communist Army on the 13th (i.e., the most recent offensive) has passed, and what follows is still political negotiation. This is a consistent practice. People say that Chen Yi and the CCP Central Committee are not in complete agreement, which may be a superficial view. After reinforcing Jinan and Qingdao with two armies, at least the current situation in Shandong can be maintained, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no loss, and the Communist army must withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7th. The recent changes in Shanxi are particularly noteworthy. On the surface, it seems to be lighter than Shandong, but in fact, it is more important. This is because after the Communist army cut off the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, the two key points of Taiyuan and Datong have been strategically isolated. Moreover, Shanxi is located on the side of the hinterland of the Communist Party, and Liu Bocheng, He Long, and Chen Geng have large armies mixed in, so it is more worrying than Shandong."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eleventh War Zone, Lu Wenzhen, told reporters: During the fifteen-day ceasefire period, he received three handwritten orders from Chairman Chiang, ordering him to strictly abide by the ceasefire order in the same way as the Northeast troops, and even if the Communist army attacked, he could only limit himself to self-defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Jiang County was captured by the Communist army on the afternoon of the 20th. The county magistrate, Chen Ziwu, was injured, and some of the defending troops who broke through retreated to the suburbs of Quwo.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 20th] The Chinese Navy shelled Yantai and Weihaiwei, two seaports in northern Shandong occupied by the Communist army, at dawn on Wednesday. It is reported that the Communist army has recently used Yantai and Weihaiwei as landing sites for opening up the Northeast. It is reported that the Chinese fleet left the Qingdao base on Monday and returned to the ocean according to the planned mission. Another landing team was sent to occupy the Changshan Islands in the Bohai Sea to cut off the Communist army's route for transporting troops by sand boats.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Delegation Leaves Changchun for Harbin</h3>

<h3>US and Chinese Representatives in Zaozhuang Have Escaped and Arrived in Lincheng</h3>

<h3>Nanjing High Court Trials Wang Wen Ti, Second Son of Traitor Wang, Yesterday</h3>
<p>Court Orders Sentencing on the 26th</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Wang Wenti, the second son of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, who is twenty-one years old, was investigated and prosecuted by the Capital High Court and publicly tried in the court on the morning of the 21st. The presiding judge, Zhao Chen, first inquired in detail about the defendant's age and asked about the details of his affiliation with the puppet regime. The defendant answered each question, his words were stubborn, and he defended his father's behavior of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country. The prosecutor then refuted him, pointing out that the position of puppet major battalion commander was not a small one, and his motives for joining the army were also condemnable.

Finally, Mr. Yu hoped that political issues could be resolved as soon as possible to stabilize the situation, restore transportation, and increase production, so that finance and currency values could be stabilized and revenue and expenditure could be balanced. After the speech, Councilors Xue Mingchuang, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, and others raised inquiries regarding the abuses of taxation, preventing malicious currency inflation, reforming the currency system, handling enemy and puppet materials, receiving corruption, and the treatment of public and educational personnel, which were all answered separately by Mr. Yu.</p>
<h3>The Case of Mr. Guo Ziqi, Government Personnel of the Xinxiang Team, Being Murdered</h3>
<p>Zheng Jiemin Issues a Serious Warning to Ye Jianying</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] At the Nanbadong Village, eight kilometers south of Xiuwu, Henan, which was originally inhabited by over a hundred members of a Bo'ai local team, was suddenly attacked by over 3,000 Communist troops on the evening of the 12th. After two hours of fierce fighting, our troops were outnumbered and Nanbadong Village was captured by the Communist forces. On the 14th, our forces dispatched a team to recapture it, but on the evening of the 15th, it was again captured by the Communist forces. This was immediately reported to the Xinxiang Three-Man Group. On the morning of the 16th, the American representative, Colonel Whitelegg, agreed to go to Nanbadong Village. However, on the morning of the 17th at 11:00 AM, the Communist representative, Huang Zhen, excused himself, claiming that he had not received a report and that the truth was unclear. He promised to send Communist staff member Guo Liu to Jiaozuo for liaison. Guo returned to Xinxiang that afternoon and said that Huang Xinyou, commander of the Fourth Sub-district of the Taihang Military Region of the Communist Army, had decided to meet with the Three-Man Group at Fanqiao, south of Xiuwu, on the 18th. Colonel Whitelegg was to lead the investigation team to depart, but they had to return temporarily due to vehicle damage. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna, government translator Guo Ziqi, and Min Qingshu, a liaison officer from the headquarters stationed with the group, along with Communist representative Huang Zhen, went to Nanbadong Village. As they were about to leave, Huang Zhen suddenly claimed to be ill and did not go, instead sending staff member Guo Huang along. They departed in a jeep. While passing through Huojia, our army's Division Commander Tang added Section Chief Zhu Runshen to accompany them. At 11:00 AM, when the jeep reached the vicinity of Nandong Village, the Communist garrison opened fire. Guo Ziqi was seriously wounded in the lungs, and Min Qingshu was wounded in the leg. The jeep immediately stopped, and Communist representative Guo Huang went into the village to negotiate. As a result, the Communist army only allowed US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna and Guo Huang to enter the village. The wounded translator Guo Ziqi and liaison officer Min Qingshu were taken by Section Chief Zhu Runshen to Xiuwu for treatment. However, Guo Ziqi soon died from his serious wounds. US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna and others returned to Xinxiang that evening. Our reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters regarding this matter. According to them, officers and soldiers are extremely indignant at the Communist army's perfidious and immoral actions. The Pacification Headquarters has recently been protecting Communist troops transporting wounded and disabled soldiers from northern Hubei, providing every possible convenience. However, the Communist army arbitrarily shot and killed our personnel participating in the group. Wherever the Communist army does not want the group to perform its duties, they detain, monitor, sweep, snipe, and kill at will. However, where they need the group to mediate, they force people to comply, treating the group as their tool. If such atrocities are not severely punished, it will not only fail to do justice to the national army officers who were killed, but the group will find it even more difficult to carry out its mission in the future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] Major Guo Ziqi of the Xinxiang Group Government side was killed by the Communist army in Xiuwu County. Zheng Jiemin, Government Affairs Committee member of the Military Mediation Department, was extremely enraged upon receiving the report of the death of Major Guo and others issued by the Government representative and US representative of the group. He has issued a serious warning to Ye Jianying, demanding that the murderers be punished and this inhumane and terrorist policy of murder be abolished. Otherwise, if government personnel are repeatedly harmed, leading to other unfortunate incidents, the Communist side will bear full responsibility. Major Guo, a native of Anhui Province, was 25 years old, a graduate of Guanghua University, straightforward in nature, and full of a sense of responsibility. During the War of Resistance, he served as a translator for the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, participating in the India-Burma campaign, with outstanding achievements. After the victory, he was transferred from the Central Training Corps to the News Office of the Beiping Military Mediation Department. He went to Taiyuan, accompanying the group to mediate outside. At the beginning of May of this year, he transferred to work in Xinxiang. He gave his life for the sake of peace, a matter of great regret to all sectors of society here.</p>
<h3>Members of the Twenty-Second Group Also Detained by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] The radio station and staff of the Twenty-Second Executive Group have now been detained by the Communist army in Xuanhua Store, and the situation is extremely dire. There is clear evidence that the Central Plains Communist Army is disregarding everything and preparing to launch a struggle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 20th] The death of Guo Ziqi, a member of the Xinxiang Group government side, in Xiuwu has aroused extreme attention here. The Wuhan Group held meetings all day today to discuss the safety issues of the group members in the future. The group, which was originally scheduled to fly to Zhengzhou on the 21st, does not plan to depart as scheduled. In addition, the group going to Xuanhua Store has also been postponed.</p>

<h3>Prosperous Port Affected by War, Qingdao Becomes an Economic Shell, Communist Army Cuts off Transportation Lines, Blocking Foreign Trade, Population Soars, Grain Shortages Felt, Prices are Extremely High</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 21st] Qingdao, originally a prosperous port in North China, has become an economic shell due to the impact of war from the outside and political relations from within, and can only avoid collapse by relying on the monetary resources of American sailors and Marines. The port of Qingdao was originally developed by the Germans and occupied by the Japanese army for seven years during the war. Later, it became the base of the US Seventh Fleet, and its name began to reappear in the newspapers. Recently, there have been reports of the Communist army attacking again, which has attracted more attention from the world. Today, nine-tenths of the eastern peninsula are under the control of the Communist army. Qingdao City is surrounded by mountains, and the Communist army is less than twenty miles away from the city, cutting off its transportation lines. Therefore, it is extremely impossible to trade with the outside world. Shandong's peanut oil production is abundant, and bean cakes and peanuts are piled up inland, waiting for the situation to be peaceful before being transported to Qingdao. The local textile mills have been devastated by the war, and the shortage of raw materials has led to the market being depressed. The economic capacity is only a quarter of what it was before the war, while the population has increased from 560,000 to 762,000 before the war, including about 90,000 refugees who fled from the Communist-occupied areas.</p>
<p>The nine textile factories used to employ no less than 30,000 male workers, but now they have been reduced to 4,000. The factories are now operated by the China Textile Corporation, with more than 600,000 spindles and 30,000 looms, with a total investment of no less than several million US dollars. Flour mills cannot operate because there is no wheat supply. Inflation and rampant speculation make the scene even darker. Most Chinese in the city do not get enough to eat, but neutral observers say that there are as many as 40,000 tons of millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, wheat, and coal stored in the warehouses, enough to feed the entire city for six months. According to municipal officials, there are only 7,000 tons of goods in the warehouses, but regardless of the true number, it is clear that someone is manipulating the market prices, which fluctuate, and speculators are profiting from it. On the 19th of this month, a pair of ordinary leather shoes cost US$40, coal fines sold for $75 per ton, and a men's suit cost $220. Although the municipal government has expressly prohibited price increases, prices are still rising. Political conflicts and armed warfare make it impossible for Qingdao City to be stable, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is in great pain to transport relief supplies to the countryside. According to Qi Hazhefu, the British district director of the League, automobile transportation could have been problem-free, but 90% of the people only received 10% of the relief supplies. American sailors and Marines enter and leave restaurants and dance halls in Qingdao, squandering at will, and there are projects worth millions of dollars to build public housing, so that Qingdao City can retain a part of its vitality. However, the feelings between China and foreign countries cannot be called harmonious, and accidents occur constantly. Pedestrians on the road show obvious hostility. Recently, the news of the Communist army attacking Qingdao has been heavily reported in various Chinese newspapers, which has made people panic and the situation is very tense. Walking on the streets at night is unavoidable anxious. The US military has always maintained calm and awaits orders, but some people believe that this is a test of the US military's diplomatic tactics, and a greater test is yet to come.</p>
<h3>Garment Factory Employee Flees with Huge Sum of Money</h3>

It has been many days since the money was withdrawn, but the factory has not seen him return. The factory is now conducting a strict investigation. It is said that the total amount of money is approximately 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Great Piece of Good News! The Last Chance!</h3>
<p>The bright and shining ceasefire order was originally scheduled to expire at noon today. Yesterday, everyone was anxiously wondering if there was any hope for peace, when the Chairman of the National Government finally ordered an extension of the deadline by eight days! The validity period of the previous order for all armies to cease advancing, attacking, and pursuing has been extended to noon on June 30! This is a great piece of good news; this is especially the last chance! The government has certainly shown its greatest sincerity, and the Communist Party should live up to this great piece of good news. We believe that the Communist Party is, after all, the Communist Party of China, and the members of the CCP are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. They should no longer procrastinate and delay, missing this last and greater opportunity for a peaceful resolution!</p>
<p>During the 15-day ceasefire period, the original plan was to negotiate and resolve three major issues first: (1) completely stop the conflict in the Northeast; (2) completely restore domestic transportation; and (3) quickly implement the plan for the demobilization and reorganization of the armed forces. However, after 15 days of negotiation, no one was not headache and heartbroken. Not only did the fighting not stop, but the fighting became more fierce both inside and outside the Northeast. And the negotiations continued, with much talk but still no results! Finally, on the eve of the expiry date, President Chiang had to make a wise decision in his great concern, extending the deadline by eight days to give everyone a final chance to continue the talks. We wonder, how can these warmongers be worthy of the President? How can they be worthy of the country? How can they be worthy of their ancestors and descendants?</p>
<p>For the sake of the country and the people, we naturally hope that the Communist Party will cherish these eight days and not miss this last opportunity. Even for the sake of the future of the Communist Party, and for the sake of leaving a place for the members of the Communist Party to meet with the people, they should not miss this last opportunity. The CCP is strict in organization, brave in action, and skilled in propaganda, so no one dares to believe that the surprise attacks by the Communist army in various places in the past 15 days were free actions by local leaders, and not due to secret orders from the organization. Because of this, we still want to appeal to the leaders of the CCP: Today, China cannot afford internal strife! Friendly countries hope that our country will be peaceful and become a strong, unified, and democratic China. The people even more hope to complete the great cause of national construction and revival in an atmosphere of peace. After fighting for eight years, the people have suffered enough. Why not let everyone take a breath! However, although the ceasefire order has been issued and negotiations are underway, the conflict has never stopped. Why? In a word, the Communist Party's strategy seems not to hope for the success of the negotiations, but only to "delay." Delay! Delay! Delay! Delay until the country is divided, until the nation declines, until a strong, unified, and democratic China can never be built, until 450 million compatriots have no food to eat, until the day when their "proletarian revolution" can erupt, and we and our descendants can ignore whether we have the face to stand in the world. What a great "delay" tactic! The critical illness of China may be due to this "delay." We want to awaken our compatriots and agree not to allow the Communist Party to play the "delay" trick again in these eight days of extension! If we let them delay again, we will definitely delay until the "good news" is shattered and the "opportunity" disappears!</p>
<p>Why do we know that the CCP still wants to delay? Just look at the propositions Zhou Enlai made to the press after his talks with Special Envoy Marshall the day before yesterday. He said: (1) Regardless of whether it is inside or outside the customs, there is no time limit to stop the conflict and wait for mediation; (2) If the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party needs mediation by friendly countries, it must be handled in accordance with President Truman's statement on China policy issued on December 15 last year and the communique issued by the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the three countries. These two points seem very pleasant and high-sounding, but in fact, he still wants the CCP's masterpiece, the "delay" trick. First, without a time limit, the CCP can talk and fight at the same time, and there will never be an end. Second, mediation by friendly countries has long been a fact, and it has come from the wishes and requests of the CCP. Why go back today to repeat the "hypothetical" words "if it is needed..."? It can be seen that they are somewhat unwelcome to mediation. Third, mediation and negotiation must have results, and it must be about the most specific issues. Now, setting aside the three major issues within the deadline of the ceasefire order, why drag out the principles of Truman's statement and the Moscow Communique? Fourth, Truman's statement on December 15 last year was nothing more than (1) the US government hopes for a strong, unified, and democratic China; (2) the fighting between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party or other miscellaneous troops must stop; (3) convene a national conference of representatives of all parties and factions to complete China's unification; (4) The United Nations and the United States only recognize the current National Government as the sole legal government of the Republic of China, especially in cooperating with the National Government in clearing out Japanese forces in China. In addition, the announcement of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, regarding China, only stated that the three powers abide by the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and agreed that the US and Soviet forces would each withdraw from China after the mission was completed. We have reviewed the traitorous China policy of the past six months, which is completely in accordance with the above-mentioned principles and does not cross the line, and the negotiations facilitated by Ambassador Ma are nothing more than to realize these ideals. Instead of raising the principles again at this time, why not hurry up and seriously negotiate specific issues? From this, it can be seen that the CCP still intends to implement their "delay" policy. But can we common people still allow them to delay again?</p>
<p>From today onwards, we must cherish this good news and cherish this opportunity with 120,000 points of care. We must sincerely thank Special Envoy Marshall for his tireless efforts in mediation. We especially thank the US State Department for submitting to Congress a bill to continue military aid to China in order to accomplish the following two major missions: (1) to assist in the merger of the Kuomintang and Communist armies to implement the reorganization plan; (2) to develop an effective force so that the Security Council can use it to maintain peace in the Far East. This kind of assistance from the United States and this kind of mediation by Special Envoy Marshall are truly appreciated by every Chinese people from the bottom of their hearts! Opposing the stationing of US troops in China and refusing to listen to the arbitration of Special Envoy Marshall are by no means the opinions of the Chinese people. In short, in an instant, 15 days have passed! Now, it has been extended by eight days, which is even shorter. Every minute and every second of these eight days is especially precious and should be cherished. Don't let it go by again! The government representatives must work hard, the CCP representatives must work even harder, and we common people must work especially hard!</p>

<p>Local dispatches</p>
<h3>Thirteen Counties in Jiangxi and Anhui Complete Dike Construction, Anqing Establishes Construction Headquarters, Station Chiefs Arrive from Wuhu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Anqing Dispatch] Since its establishment, the Anhui Branch of the Relief Administration has attached great importance to post-disaster relief work, actively repairing river embankments, dredging river channels, and digging wells to increase production and stabilize people's livelihoods after the war. It has also passively relocated refugees, comforted displaced people, and provided extensive relief, all in accordance with the regulations of the headquarters or based on local conditions. Recently, with the rising tide and the imminent arrival of floods, the Anqing Headquarters for Dike Construction was established to address the people's suffering and the importance of the river embankments. Sub-stations were established in Huaining, Tongcheng, Susong, and Wangjiang counties. Hu Qingzhen was appointed as the general station chief of the Anqing area, concurrently as the station chief of Huaining. Yang Yiming was appointed as the station chief of Tongcheng. Cai Yanxian was appointed as the station chief of Susong, and Hu Zuyin was appointed as the station chief of Wangjiang. The station chiefs arrived in Qing on the 12th from Wuhu. After surveying the river embankments, they will stay for about two or three days before going to the branch to carry out the plan to repair the Yangtze River embankments, completing the dikes in thirteen counties from Jiujiang to Dangtu, and jointly working with Sun, the acting chairman of the Central Yangtze River Water Conservancy Engineering Committee, and Zhu, the director of the blocking and embankment restoration project, and Sheng, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, to actively expedite construction. However, due to rain and busy farming season, the project is progressing with difficulty and is unlikely to be completed as scheduled. According to our reporter's survey of the actual situation of the river embankments, they are the lifeline of thirteen counties in Anhui, including Huayang, and have a significant impact on the autumn harvest of millions of people's fields.</p>
<h3>Grain Payments Held Back, Additional Taxes Unbearable</h3>
<p>Appeals from the People of Nanling County</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanling Dispatch] According to a letter from the people of Nanling County: "Nanling, Anhui, has always been a rice-producing area in southern Anhui. During the Anti-Japanese War, it fell to the enemy three times, suffering heavy losses. In addition, there was no rain in early summer last year, and autumn harvest taxes were reduced. Last year, Anhui Province was ordered to requisition 3 million dan of military grain. After representatives from various counties went to Beijing to request a reduction, the amount was reduced to 1.8 million dan. Nanling's quota reached 120,000 dan. The central government set the price for the requisitioned military grain at 4,500 yuan per dan, but the provincial government deducted 500 yuan per dan, and the commissioner's office deducted 200 yuan per dan, leaving the people with only 3,800 yuan. At the time, the grain price differed by only 1,000 yuan. If the grain payments had been fully distributed, the people could have paid in full at once. However, the grain requisition was divided into three phases. The first phase was paid in full last year, including the grain sent to the Wuhu warehouse. The receiving personnel required a 'cigarette fee' before accepting payment, resulting in considerable losses. Even more strangely, the grain payments were withheld for months after the grain was submitted. Now, the second phase is being urgently demanded. The people have not received the grain payments from the previous submission, and the current grain price is 25,000-26,000 yuan per dan, a difference of 20,000 yuan compared to last year. The people have almost no grain left and cannot pay. Therefore, the county magistrate and township chiefs are wielding their authority, indiscriminately arresting people. How can the survivors of the war endure such suffering again? We earnestly hope that the authorities will investigate and severely punish corruption, and the people of the entire county will be deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Begin Discussing the Trieste Issue, Meeting Proceeding in Harmonious Atmosphere</h3>

<h3>Large Batch of Animals Sent to Island for Atomic Bomb Test, Will Risk Experiencing a Man-Made Disaster for Scientific Research</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 20th Dispatch] A batch of animals for the July 1st atomic bomb test on warships are being transported by the U.S. Navy transport ship "Burleson" to Bikini Atoll. There are 4,000 white mice, 200 goats and pigs each, and a small number of guinea pigs and house mice, as well as a batch of microorganisms and insects. This batch of animals, like Noah's Ark, will risk experiencing a disaster in the flood – a man-made disaster. The day before the Bikini test, they will be placed in 22 ships. There are 77 ships in total for the test. After the first bomb explodes, as soon as people can safely step onto the test ships, these animals will be immediately transported back to the "Burleson" and examined by biologists to see what the effects of the atomic bomb explosion are.</p>
<p>The value and completeness of the instruments and equipment carried by the "Burleson" for this test can be said to be unprecedented for any ship. Everything from the animals' skin to the smallest parts of their body cells will be used as test subjects. Even the microorganisms and insects growing in the sick animals will be torn apart by scientists to determine what effects nuclear radiation has on their genetic makeup. Some animals will be vaccinated with smallpox, antitoxins, hormones, and vitamins to test whether atomic rays affect antitoxic substances. The hair of some goats will be cut short to match the length of human hair. This is to investigate the value of hair for protecting the brain and resisting heat and other types of radiation. Other goats will be coated with sunscreen to see if it is effective.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty white mice are very prone to cancer. Will the rays emitted when the atomic bomb explodes cause them to develop cancer? Whether the atomic bomb explosion will cause infertility can also be answered by examining the sex organs of the tested animals. Another major issue in the test is the effect of the atomic bomb explosion on blood. White blood cells will play an important role in this test. The pedigree of each white mouse has been tested separately and recorded on cards. After the atomic bomb explodes, scientists can know what kind of changes occur in their blood and to what extent.</p>
<p>When this batch of animals is placed on the test ship, their position will be the same as the position during naval combat. Rice and water can be automatically supplied to them without human management. There are about fifty scientists and technicians working on the test in Bikini.</p>
<p>Lie Invited to Visit</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 20th Dispatch] It was announced today that the U.S. government has invited UN Secretary-General Lie to visit the atomic bomb test on Bikini Island. The invitation stated that the test is not a joint or international test, but a scientific test conducted solely by the U.S. government.</p>
<h3>Possible Agreement Between U.S. and Soviet Union on Atomic Energy Control, Britain Considering Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of atomic energy control, President Truman recently told reporters that the United States and the Soviet Union are negotiating and may reach an agreement. Truman declined to comment on the content of the Soviet proposal, but reiterated that he fully supports the proposal made by U.S. representative Baruch to ban the use of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th Dispatch] The British government is considering the Soviet proposal to destroy and ban the use of atomic bombs. Non-official opinions are mostly opposed, saying that this is the opinion of countries that do not have atomic bombs, so they have only benefits and no losses. It is also pointed out that since the atomic bomb has been produced, even if it is destroyed, it cannot reverse scientific progress or eliminate general anxiety and suspicion. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union's simple proposal is not suitable for such a complex issue. The British government's Atomic Energy Committee is currently considering the proposal and will submit its opinion to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>International Snippets</h3>
<p>The new proposal put forward by the British government has been approved in principle by the Egyptian delegation. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov has accepted the position of Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission.</p>

Liang was wearing a thin floral blue silk robe, white silk pants, floral striped silk socks, and black satin shoes with white soles. He stood in the defendant's dock, trying to appear calm. At this time, President Liu held the verdict in his hand, his eyes shining brightly, and remained silent for a long time. All the listeners also held their breath and waited. The solemn atmosphere of the courtroom and the solemn demeanor of the judge seemed to be different from the past. The faces of the defendant's family, sitting upright in the audience, suddenly became tense. President Liu then began to speak to Liang, "Your case has been reviewed and concluded, and this court will pronounce the verdict today." After speaking, he stood up solemnly and read the main text of the verdict: "Liang Hongzhi colluded with the enemy and conspired to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated." After reading, he sat down again and said to Liang, "Because your crime is serious and unforgivable, this case is sentenced to death to uphold national law. If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days after receiving the verdict." Standing in the defendant's dock, Liang Hongzhi's crossed hands behind his back began to tremble slightly when the judge read the "death penalty." He pinched and released his hands alternately, causing many wrinkles on his blue silk robe. Although he was still trying to force a smile on his face, his pale face, sweat on his forehead, and unnatural bitter smile failed to conceal his complex emotions. After the judge finished speaking, he took out a handkerchief to wipe his face and asked the judge if he could say a few words to his family. President Liu replied, "You can meet in prison." After speaking, he stepped down and ordered the bailiffs to take him back. At this time, one of Liang's wives and concubines stood up and followed closely behind, and his daughter-in-law cried out in court. Liang himself remained silent. Liang is the first person in this city's High Court to be sentenced to death for treason, but the date of formal execution is still pending and will be determined after the Supreme Court's review. (For the full text of the Liang case verdict, see the corner of this edition.)</p>

<h3>Another View on Solving the Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>Should Protect Property Rights of Landlords and Ban Manipulation by Second Landlords</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The housing shortage in this city is severe. This reporter paid a special visit to Yang Kuanlin, a famous architectural engineer and dean of the College of Engineering of St. John's University, to ask for his opinion on solving the housing shortage. According to him, the main reason why landlords or the construction industry are unwilling to build houses is that property rights are not guaranteed and all the profits are taken by second landlords. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the government can take care of the people's property rights and effectively ban the manipulation of second landlords. Regarding building materials, Yang's opinion is that domestic materials should be used as much as possible and improved and manufactured, which can not only reduce costs but also develop the domestic industry.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Law Office of the Garrison Command has completed the initial interrogation of the Grain Loan Case on the 20th and is now in the process of sorting and reviewing it, and the trial will begin in the near future. This reporter met with Zeng Zhaoyi, Director of the Military Law Office, yesterday and asked about Zeng's visit to the District Prosecutor's Office the day before. According to him, the Grain Loan Case will still be tried by military law. Although Wang Daren was not escorted back to the office yesterday, he will be brought to the office together with Ren Xingyai within a few days. According to this reporter's investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office prepared a document yesterday to welcome Rong Yongming. The Garrison Command did not agree to transfer the case because Rong's case only involved suspicion of raising rice prices and was not related to the Grain Loan Case. However, according to Prosecutor Wu of the District Prosecutor's Office, the handling of the Grain Loan Case should be fully accepted by the court in accordance with the provisions of the law. Therefore, the case is now being fully investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office in accordance with legal procedures. Due to insufficient preparation yesterday, the interrogation was not opened. The protagonist of the case, Wang Daren, was issued a "release order" by Prosecutor Wu before the interrogation on the morning of the day before yesterday, and it was planned to transfer him to the Garrison Command after the interrogation. In the evening, he was issued an "arrest warrant" and sent back to the District Court Detention Center at about 5:00 PM. He was reclassified as prisoner No. 1015 and ordered to "stop visits." Wang was quite comfortable in prison, and his family began to visit and deliver items yesterday. It is said that he will be transferred to the Garrison Command after the third interrogation on the morning of the 24th.</p>

<h3>The Hongmen Group Forming a Political Party May Not Become Reality</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper reported yesterday about the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang possibly changing its organization to form a political party. Lately, there have indeed been such rumors circulating outside. However, in order to investigate the truth, the reporter yesterday separately interviewed Zheng Ziliang, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhiben, Chen Peide, and Li Yongxiang, who are all related to the Hongmen. According to them, since Situ Meitang and Zhao Yu, representatives of the Zhi Gong Tang from overseas, came to Shanghai, there are plans to unite domestic Hongmen leaders and hold a Hongmen representative kinship conference on July 15th. As for the Hongmen forming a political party, they have heard nothing about it. They further stated that even if a political party were formed, it would definitely not be under the name of the Zhi Gong Party. Representing the various mountain halls of the Hongmen both domestically and overseas, the entire organization (Zhi Gong Tang) would not change to a political party. The Zhi Gong Tang is only a unit of the overseas Hongmen. Various places within the country have different hall names. This city does not have a Zhi Gong Tang branch, but there is a united Hongmen Association, established before the war. Hongmen pioneers Xiang Songpo, Wang Yucheng (deceased), Cui Tongxia, Mao Yun, and others (Zheng et al. referring to themselves) were all initiators. They have close connections with Hongmen mountain halls in the Yangtze River basin, South China, and North China. Last Tuesday, the association held a restoration meeting, attended by eighteen units from the mountain halls. The formation of a political party was not mentioned at all, and the mountain masters had absolutely no such motivation or intention. The Hongmen has three major traditional creeds, and does not wish to be involved in the political arena. We (1) unite with righteousness, (2) save the country with loyalty, and (3) eliminate evil with chivalry. Under these three creeds, we support the government, save the nation from peril, and stand on the side of the people to fulfill our duties. Therefore, there is really no need to form a political party. Therefore, the rumored change of the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang to a political party is only a proposal by a portion of the overseas Hongmen and may not become a reality.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Verdict in the Liang Hongzhi Case</h3>
<p>It is found that the traitor Liang is a native of Changle, 64 years old, residing at No. 150 Bute Road, Shanghai. The lawyers retained for his defense this time are Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Hongru, and Li Guozhen. The facts and reasons in the full text of the verdict in this case are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Liang Hongzhi once served as a Counselor of the State Council, Senator, and Secretary-General of the Executive Department of the Beijing Government. After the success of the National Government's Northern Expedition and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the defendant's political career came to an end. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out and Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the Japanese plotted to establish a puppet regime to promote their policy of aggression. The defendant recognized this as his only opportunity to seize power and colluded with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Xi, and others to communicate with the enemy and conspire with the enemy chiefs in Shanghai to establish the puppet Central China regime, only three months after the National Government moved west. The pain of the Battle of Shanghai was still fresh in people's minds, and the people swore to never coexist with the Japanese invaders. However, on March 28, 1938, the defendant established the puppet Provisional Government in Nanjing, issued a declaration, established two houses and eight departments, and governed three provinces and two cities. The person himself served as the President of the Executive Yuan, assumed overall power, changed to the five-colored flag, presided over political meetings, recruited troops to secure the enemy's rear, forcibly occupied the customs to enrich the puppet regime's finances, and publicly sold opium to promote the enemy's policy of poisoning the population. He successively signed agreements with the enemy chiefs on railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking, and jointly operated companies with the enemy, such as Central China Railway, Electrical Communications, Salt Industry, Shipping, and Huaxing Bank. He repeatedly consulted with Wang Kemin, the head of the puppet Provisional Government in North China, to discuss a merger in order to boost their image. Finally, in March of the 28th year, the puppet Central China Government United Committee was established, and the defendant jointly issued a declaration of establishment. In November of the same year, he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures for liaison purposes. After returning to China, he published his impressions of his visit to Japan, filled with traitorous words. In April of the 29th year, Wang Jingwei betrayed the Party and the country and secretly came to Shanghai to form a puppet National Government. The defendant, realizing that Wang Jingwei had the support of the enemy and knowing that he was no match for him, consulted with Wang and Wang several times. Then, on September 21st and 23rd of the same year, he jointly issued a declaration in the name of the puppet Provisional and Provisional Governments, responding to Wang's proposed peace movement. In January of the following year, he convened a meeting in Qingdao and jointly decided to organize the puppet Central Political Conference. On March 20th, another meeting was held in Nanjing to discuss the adjustment plan for Sino-Japanese relations and the establishment of a framework for the puppet National Government, and announced the candidates for ministers of various departments of the puppet National Government. On March 30th, the puppet National Government was formally established in the capital, jointly issuing a preposterous declaration of returning to the capital and the political platform of the puppet National Government. At the same time, the puppet Provisional and Provisional Governments announced their dissolution, and the defendant was appointed President of the puppet Supervisory Yuan and concurrently a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. On November 20th of the 33rd year, the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, Chen Gongbo, succeeded Wang Jingwei as Chairman of the puppet National Government due to Wang's death. The defendant took over as President of the puppet Legislative Yuan and revised many puppet laws. He only resigned and came to Shanghai after the Japanese surrendered and was escorted by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor of this court.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>In this case, the defendant Liang Hongzhi, taking advantage of the war of resistance against Japan and the retreat of the national army to the west, colluded with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Xi, and others in Shanghai to conspire with the enemy chiefs to establish a puppet regime. On March 28th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the puppet Provisional Government was established in the capital, and he himself served as the President of the puppet Executive Yuan, assuming overall military and political power, changing the national flag, recruiting troops, seizing customs, publicly selling opium, and successively signing railway, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking agreements with the enemy chiefs. He jointly operated transportation, electrical communications, salt industry, financial, and various other companies. These facts are not only admitted without hesitation during the trial and investigation by this court, but also supported by the staff lists of the various departments of the puppet Provisional Government, secret service agency files, classified documents, Central China Electrical Communications Company files, Central China Communications Military Agreement files, Sino-Japanese Treaty Anniversary Essay files, propaganda document files, records of the puppet Provisional Government, foreign debt loan files of the puppet Ministry of Railways, and the records in past years of the "Xinwen Bao" and "Shen Bao Yearbook," and the "New China Handbook." As for how he consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet Provisional Government, to organize the puppet Chinese Government United Committee and issue a declaration, how he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures, and published his impressions after returning to China, and how he responded to Wang Jingwei's peace movement, participated in the meeting to establish the puppet National Government, and served as the President of the puppet Supervisory and Legislative Yuan and attended the meetings of the puppet Central Political Committee, etc., are also described in detail in the confessions, and are corroborated by the seized anniversary album of the puppet Provisional Government, documents on peace and anti-communist nation-building, the special issue of the puppet Nanjing Xinbao for the second anniversary, the files of the puppet Provisional Government, and the declaration files. The defendant</p>
<p>colluded with the enemy to oppose the war of resistance</p>
<p>As for the defenses he has made, they are nothing more than the following: (1) After the 27th year of the Republic of China, the war became more intense and the people suffered more. The defendant, out of compassion for the people, organized the Provisional Government with the aim of rescuing the people in the occupied areas and preserving the nation's vitality. Its scope was no more than a larger maintenance association. The change of the national flag was to avoid Japanese military interference, the establishment of the Pacification Army was originally to maintain local security, the establishment of the Bureau of Opium Prohibition was to stop the Japanese from running opium, and the issuance of Huaxing currency did not affect people's livelihood. The collection of taxes was only enough to maintain the expenses of the Provisional Government. All of these were to rescue the people, and there was no intention to resist the country. (2) Regarding the agreements on railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking, their nature was temporary, and their content was not beneficial to the enemy. Instead, they were trying to win back some rights from the enemy's hands. How could they be described as harming the country and humiliating the nation? (3) The Japanese military tried to establish special agencies and grain control mechanisms in the Provisional Government, but the defendant firmly refused to allow them to be implemented. The antiques and books of Nanjing were all looted by the Japanese military, but the defendant negotiated for their return, and the culture was preserved. (4) The defendant mistakenly believed that Wang Zhaoming's peace movement was a strategy for the central government to fight and negotiate at the same time, so he did not oppose it. Regarding the proposals of the Central Political Conference, Wang read them out and they were immediately passed. The defendant never participated, and even if he did, he never spoke, so he cannot be held responsible. (5) The defendant secretly reported enemy secrets to the central government in the 29th year and rescued political workers from prison. After the victory, the defendant worked in the vanguard army to maintain security in Nanjing and Shanghai, and he made some small contributions. On July 15th of the 34th year, he surrendered himself to the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, requesting that his sentence be reduced according to law, and he presented witnesses Xue Dake and letters from former President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi and Chen Mengren Yuan Dao Qu Lizhai as proof. (The above are the main points of the oral and written statements made by the defendant's side.) Regarding the first point, according to the fact that the enemy established puppet governments in the occupied areas, originally to achieve</p>
<p>the goal of using Chinese to control Chinese and supporting the war with war</p>
<p>The defendant, following the enemy's wishes, organized the puppet Provisional Government, established two houses and eight departments, governed three provinces and two cities, assumed overall power, issued orders, seized Central China, and formed a separatist regime. This is not comparable to the maintenance associations organized by merchants and residents, and it is clearly inappropriate to compare himself to a maintenance association. Moreover, his recruitment of bandit troops, public sale of opium, issuance of counterfeit currency, and extortionate levies all harmed the country and the people and fueled the enemy's flames. Yet he still claimed to be revitalizing the people and preserving the nation's vitality, which is even more of a reversal of right and wrong. Furthermore, according to the declarations he has issued in the past, one said: "The scorched earth policy is tantamount to suicide, and accommodating communism is tantamount to inviting bandits. It is the only evil government in Chinese history!" (See the declaration of the puppet Provisional Government) Another said: "The power of the Kuomintang is more than two-thirds gone, and annihilation is imminent!" (Remarks made after the fall of Wuhan) A third said: "The party government, which is autocratic and misleads the country, has lost the people's faith and is on the verge of collapse!" (Remarks made on the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing) He wantonly slandered the central government. The political platform of his puppet Provisional Government also prioritized the separation of powers, changed to the five-colored flag, disrupted the national constitution, and rebelled against the government. The signs of his treachery are extremely obvious. His claim that he had no intention of resisting the country is obviously a lie. Regarding the second point, the Provisional Government was originally a puppet organization fostered by the enemy. Its agreements with the enemy were nothing more than farcical dramas. The content is not worth arguing about. Moreover, it is verified that the defendant, in the name of the puppet President of the Executive Yuan, signed a military agreement with Yamada Otsuzo, commander of the Central China Expeditionary Force of the enemy army, regarding communications in Central China. The first article states that the commander of the army or the commander of the fleet may conduct communication inspections and control communications based on military necessity (see the Miscellaneous Category Zheng Zi No. 4 file of the puppet Ministry of Transportation). Regarding joint railway operations with the enemy, it was stipulated that in the Central China region, the Provisional Government and the Japanese side would sign an agreement to establish the Central China Railway Company, which would be entrusted with management and operation, such as the Jinghu, Huhu, and Sujia lines (see the puppet Ministry of Transportation's planning on adjusting the joint railway company). Regarding shipping, there were the Huayun Shipping Company and the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, organized under Japanese leadership, which were approved by the Provisional Government one after another (see the puppet Ministry of Transportation No. 1579 file). The content of these agreements was absolutely beneficial to the enemy in terms of military, politics, and economy. The defendant’s</p>
<p>false claim to have won back rights from the enemy</p>
<p>is even more absurd and deceptive. Regarding the third point, it is verified that during the period of the Provisional Government, a puppet special agency had been established at No. 76 Jessfield Road in the western district of Shanghai,</p>
<p>killing, looting, and acting lawlessly</p>
<p>As for the grain control mechanism, although it was not established at that time, the enemy army collected military rice in the Central China area and needed the puppet government to assist them. It is difficult to believe that he firmly refused to allow these two matters to be implemented. As for the claim that he recovered Nanjing books and antiques from the enemy, even if that were the case, under the control of the enemy forces, even if they were recovered, it would be like taking them from one treasury and storing them in another. What preservation is there to speak of? Regarding the fourth point, Wang Jingwei, the traitor who betrayed the Party and the country, issued a flamboyant telegram advocating peace. The central government immediately condemned him, stripped Wang of his position, and expelled him from the Party. National public opinion unanimously criticized him. The newspapers at the time all published this (see the Xinwen Bao on January 1, 1940). How could the defendant have been mistaken? Furthermore, according to the statements made by the puppet Provisional Government, "Jingwei (Wang Jingwei) bravely escaped from Chongqing and repeatedly issued declarations of peace and national salvation, and is willing to discuss national affairs with sages at home and abroad. Wang took the initiative to achieve what we had long hoped for, and permanent peace between China and Japan will not be difficult to achieve." And according to the statements of the puppet Provisional and Provisional United Committee, "Based on the mission of the establishment of this committee, we are willing to assist Wang Jingwei with all our strength in establishing the central government." It can be seen that the defendant not only did not oppose Wang’s advocacy of peace, but also actively supported it. Their collusion is already obvious. Furthermore, the defendant served as the President of the Supervisory and Legislative Yuan of the puppet Nanjing Government and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. He and Wen Zongyao and others publicly nominated Wang Jingwei as the Chairman of the puppet National Government at the 28th meeting of the puppet Central Political Committee on November 8 of the 29th year, which was approved by resolution, as recorded in the gazette of the puppet government. He now claims that he did not participate in the meeting and did not speak.</p>
<p>These facts are the opposite of the truth</p>
<p>Regarding the fifth point, although the defendant claimed that he secretly reported secrets to the central government in the 29th year, and the witness Xue Dake testified in court and presented a letter from the former President of the Executive Yuan Kong, the letter only stated that he had received reports (referring to Xue Dake's report) that Liang and other key figures of the puppet regime had secretly contacted them. This can only prove that the defendant had negotiated with personnel sent by the central government, but it cannot prove that he had any actual work. It is difficult to consider this as assisting the war of resistance. And the statement in Qu Lizhai's letter that Dong Renyi and Wu Qianli were entrusted to Liang Zhongyi (i.e., the defendant) to find a way to rescue them, so they were able to be released in advance, even if it were true, would only be occasionally accommodating friends and helping one or two individuals, and it is not enough to speak of actions that benefit the people. As for the claim that he made some small contributions to maintaining security in Nanjing and Shanghai after the victory, even if the vanguard army was working in the Nanjing and Shanghai area at that time and the defendant provided some assistance, it was only a matter of trying to cover up past mistakes when at the end of the road, and there is no merit to speak of. Moreover, the defendant did not voluntarily surrender before the crime was discovered, but was put on trial. This does not comply with the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Regulations on Dealing with Traitors. Even if he had stated the facts in writing to the Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau on July 15 of the 34th year, it was only a confession and cannot be considered a surrender, and cannot be used to request a reduction or exemption of punishment. In view of the above points, the defenses are purely excuses.</p>
<p>Attempts to shirk responsibility are not worth adopting</p>
<p>After the enemy launched the August 13 Incident, our country adopted a policy of long-term resistance, and the whole country made every effort. However, as soon as Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the defendant stood up, colluded with the enemy to rebel, seized Nanjing, claimed to be the government, changed the national flag, and signed agreements without authorization, confusing international audiences and shaking the psychology of the people. This was truly taking the risk of the world's disapproval. When Wang Jingwei betrayed the central government and issued a peace telegram, the defendant colluded with Wang Kemin to respond and support the movement. A group of traitors gathered to discuss and form a puppet government, still holding important positions and never leaving, only seeking his own power and status, disregarding national sovereignty and the nation's lifeline. Moreover, he took the lead in betraying the country, acting as Wang's precursor to stealing the throne, inciting chaos in Central China, and conspiring with the traitors in Hebei and Chahar. A monstrous traitor is rarely matched. If he is not sentenced to death, it will not be enough to demonstrate justice and highlight the national law. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated. Based on the above, it is concluded that, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, and Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, the preceding paragraph of Article 2 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 57, Article 37, Paragraph 1, the judgment shall be as stated in the main text. This case was executed in court by Dai Rongkun, Prosecutor of this court. June 21, 35th year of the Republic of China, Trial President of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai High Court, Judge Liu Yugui, Associate Judge Cao Jun, Associate Judge Qiu Huanxuan.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders the Ministry of Education to Allow Graduating Students of Provisional Universities to Participate in the Graduation Examination of Formal Universities</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is currently drafting appropriate measures in accordance with the order</p>
<p>[Special Report from Nanjing by Our Newspaper] For graduating students of provisional universities who wish to participate in the examinations for graduates of formal universities in order to pursue further studies, Chairman Chiang has personally issued an order to the Ministry of Education to draft appropriate measures to handle this matter. The Ministry of Education is currently drafting appropriate measures. It is said that graduating students of provisional universities generally believe that although their graduation certificates may state their qualifications, it is difficult to avoid societal discrimination. They worry that their future prospects for career opportunities and further studies abroad may be considerably affected. Therefore, they made this request. It is also said that the administrative side is providing relief measures, that is, graduating students of provisional universities this year can register three months before the graduation examination of formal universities for the same subjects they have studied, participate in the examination, and if their results pass, they will be issued a diploma from a formal university, allowing them to pursue further studies. This year, various universities have not fully recovered, and the graduation results of provisional universities have not been determined, so this matter will have to wait until next year to be implemented.

<h3>Yongjia Launches a Respect-for-Teachers Movement - Fundraising Methods Border on Intimidation</h3>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Yongjia] Since the Yongjia County Small Education Advancement Association in Zhejiang Province launched a respect-for-teachers movement, it has received a response from the entire education community, and the outside world has shown unlimited sympathy for the difficult lives of elementary school teachers. However, the collection of respect-for-teachers donations by various schools is not consistent in its methods, and students' families inevitably have mixed feelings. Moreover, a small number of elementary schools, for wealthy families, reject donations that only meet the prescribed amount, deeming it too little, and even warn students that if they do not pay the respect-for-teachers donation, they will be disciplined or expelled. This kind of method borders on intimidation, so that all sectors of society have mixed opinions on the respect-for-teachers movement. Knowledgeable people believe that influential families should uphold the ancient saying "A teacher for one day is a father for life" and donate as much as possible, while elementary school teachers should promote the respect-for-teachers movement with the attitude of "Teachers must respect themselves first, and then others will respect them."</p>

As for the adjustment of teachers' salaries and allowances, it will be handled in accordance with the treatment of general civil servants, and there are no separate regulations for separate adjustments.</p>

<h3>Respect-for-Teachers Western Art Charity Exhibition - Various Colors Manifest the Spirit of the Times - A Rare Opportunity, the Last Act of Respect-for-Teachers</h3>
<p>Following the respect-for-teachers Chinese painting charity sale, there is now a Western art charity exhibition, which opened yesterday at the New Life Club. The reporter, being fond of art and sympathetic to the respect-for-teachers movement, drove to the club on Weihaiwei Road in the not-too-hot morning to visit. Over a hundred paintings, hung neatly and staggered, dazzled the eye in the fairly spacious "Frugality Hall" on the second floor, like being on the road to Shanyin, too much to take in! At the beginning, I saw an oil painting of about 40 inches, Jin Qijing's "Farewell at Jianggan," a poetic theme that is truly thought-provoking. There are green hills and clear waters, and several plum trees, half withered, swaying in the wind, quite close to the style of Chinese painting, but the small steamer in the middle, is firing up and moving quickly, which fully expresses the spirit of the times, and is different from the sails commonly seen in Chinese paintings. Below, a dark red strip indicates that this 500,000 yuan masterpiece has already been reserved by "Mr. Zhu".</p>
<p>Next, the reporter shifted his gaze to various directions, Xiao Shufang's watercolor "Sleeping Child," with its unrestrained brushstrokes, matched with rough and simple colors, looks as thick as an oil painting at first glance. Zheng Dingyu's oil painting landscape, with a deep dense forest, lining a pool of autumn water, shows the faithful style of neo-classicism, and is equally his masterpiece, like his other still life. Wang Tong's two watercolor paintings "Huangpu River" and "Broadway Building" are very accurate in color and outline. The former is a surging river tide, the ochre-colored river water is advancing; the latter is a towering building, standing behind the iron bridge, a very stereotyped building, using water and color to express the description, it is not easy to be so vivid and lively.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, most of the old Western painting writers have changed, and are striving in the direction of Chinese painting. Therefore, there are very few of their works here, only Yan Wenliang is left. Mr. Yan is purely a classical writer, and everyone still remembers his masterpieces "Kitchen" and "Lu Gao Jian"! This time he has three frames, all depicting the scenery of the Su-Xi area of ​​Jiangnan, with snow scenes, moonlight, and spring. Although small and exquisite, they took a lot of effort, and the price is very cheap. Yan Guang may be doing it for the sake of respecting teachers, seeking its universality. Zhang Chongren is the first-class painter among the new writers. Judging from his products, it can be said that every piece is a fine product, especially among the landscapes, the "Gu Family Garden" frame, the color is very harmonious, the brushstrokes are calm and powerful, and the background in still lifes such as "Flowers" and "Game" is deep and dark, making the picture particularly strong and powerful, it is indeed a masterpiece, Ding Guang seems to have the same style as Yan Wenliang, fine and gentle, like spring, like gentle wind, a large 50-inch oil landscape, introducing the sweet tenderness of Jiangnan water town, paired with a very beautiful mirror frame, making people yearn! Make people play! The price of over 200,000 yuan is too cheap.</p>
<p>Liu Cangxu, Chen Zhitong, Li Yongsen, Li Zongjin, etc., all have extremely fine masterpieces on display. Zhou Bichu's small landscape, the azure sky, dangling a few thin autumn clouds, the golden yellow and tender green ground, fully expresses the beauty and loveliness of the early autumn scenery! Liu Shi only has two nude sketches, relaxed and fluent, without any effort. I heard that he was just sick after his solo exhibition, so there were no masterpieces, which is also a pity. Female writers Han Anyi and Zhou Ruying have many unique strengths in their works, but unfortunately the reporter doesn't remember clearly and cannot introduce them one by one.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter believes that the Western Painting Exhibition in honor of teachers is the last event of this respect-for-teachers movement. It is unprecedented and will never happen again. There will never be a second respect-for-teachers movement. I hope that people in the society who love art and sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers will promote and assist more, so that this Western painting exhibition will have better gains! A more satisfactory result! (Puchi, 35, 6, 21, in Shanghai)</p>

<h3>Truth Ultimately Triumphs Over Speculation - The Black Market for Public Bonds is on the Verge of Extinction - Tong Bing Fell 1,500 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Various public bonds issued more than 30 years ago are scheduled to be redeemed universally starting on July 1st. Seeing the Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency yesterday, black market speculators finally felt that their final fate had been decided. When the market opened yesterday morning, they rushed to sell. Bing bonds plummeted to the 1,000 yuan mark, with low prices seeing around 900 yuan, reaching two-thirds of the total value. Then, because short sellers made profits and replenished their positions, and speculators temporarily scrambled, the price rose again to around 1,450 yuan, a drop of 1,500 compared to before the closure. Jia and Yi bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, Ding bonds fell by 900 yuan, and Wu bonds fell by 1,100 yuan. In the afternoon, the bond and stock market was in a turbulent state, and rumors of closures were rife.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Rises by 90,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation stimulated people's hearts. When the market opened in the morning, it immediately stood firm at 1.9 million. After the opening, it gradually rose, and the US dollar came to help buy. After 10:00 AM, it hovered around 1.96 million. The central allocation of 262 bars was priced at 1,957,500. At this time, it struggled between 1.95 million and 1.96 million, and finally, due to the abundance of surplus funds, it rose again to around 1.98 million near noon. At noon, it first approached the 2 million mark, but it was suppressed and fell back in the afternoon. In the end, it still stood above 1.99 million. As a result, it rose by 90,000 compared to before the closure. Jewelry gold was listed at 210,000, silver was flat, and dark interest rose slightly, at around 1.5 jiao.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Become Popular Again - Hong Kong Dollars are Being Bought Up</h3>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars opened at around 2,620 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. Speculators spread rumors of further increases, and buying interest followed stocks, hovering and rising. Near noon, it rose to above 2,710 yuan. In the afternoon, it briefly retreated to below 2,700 yuan, but in the end, it was easily pulled up again. As a result, it closed up more than 100 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were bought up by foreign exchange dealers and rose by another 30 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was being shorted by traders, and with the success of British and American loans not far away, general trading firms rushed to develop in that port, so demand exceeded supply, rising to 515 yuan, Indian exchange rate 615 yuan, US exchange rate appeared nominally flat but internally stagnant.</p>
<h3>Rayon Soars Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of rayon in the market was more than 100,000 yuan higher than on Wednesday. This was because Zhongfang Company's shipment of No. 120 bright yarn was missing, causing those who held the goods to regard them as treasures, and the selling price skyrocketed. Tianqiao bright yarn opened at 1.78 million yuan, with the highest reaching 1.82 million yuan, before closing down slightly at 1.8 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the abundance of buyers and the need for actual sellers to replenish their stocks, the price rose sharply, reaching 1.9 million yuan and 1.94 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 300,000 yuan compared to Wednesday. No. 120 miscellaneous brand Meinu bright yarn was traded at 1.65 million yuan in the morning and 1.84 million yuan in the afternoon. Xuhui bright yarn was traded at 1.57 million yuan in the morning and offered for sale at 1.79 million yuan in the afternoon, both with an increase of over 300,000 yuan compared to last Wednesday. No. 120 semi-dull yarn increased by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, while No. 75 semi-dull yarn increased by approximately 200,000 yuan. Foreign silk merchants still lacked an appetite. Silk fabric merchants made some deals yesterday, with new inspection certificates for 76/77 grade evenness being traded at 2.2 million yuan and 2.25 million yuan. There were few transactions in user silk, with asking prices in various grades being around 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, with freight and other expenses to be borne separately. The transaction price was 1.63 million yuan. Silk goods rose slightly yesterday. Meiya bedspreads were 1.5 million yuan in the morning and 1.53 million yuan in the afternoon. Dacheng checkered cloth was 5,330 yuan in the morning and 5,440 yuan in the afternoon, more than 100 yuan stronger than Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Gold Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Currently, all gold trading in the country is concentrated in the Shanghai market. Therefore, gold transactions in Shanghai are becoming increasingly frequent. It is heard that the Central Bank recently shipped 120 boxes of gold, totaling 399.9 million, to Shanghai from the United States, which were moved into the warehouse yesterday. Another 196 boxes were shipped from Tianjin and brought into the warehouse on Sunday (the 16th).</p>
<h3>South China Faction's Appetite Increases; Double Horse Reaches New High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to soar. The South China faction's appetite for high-end goods remained strong, causing Double Horse to reach a new high of 1.48 million, an increase of 70,000 from the 19th. Other small and medium-sized yarns also followed suit, rising by about 120,000. No. 32 Sun Brand Blue Phoenix single yarn was also favored by both Hunan and Guangdong traders, with the final transaction price being 1.75 million, the same increase of 100,000 as No. 42 doubled yarn. At noon, Textile Construction opened yarn as usual, with prices similar to the previous period. However, the bidding price for No. 32 sub-brand Blue Phoenix single yarn was 30,000 higher than Wednesday. There were also ten types of coarse and fine yarn threads sold through bidding.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram showed near-term weakness and far-term strength, ranging from 5 to 19 points. The near-term price was US$29.28 and the far-term price was US$29.57. The spot price of middling was US$29.88. The local raw cotton trade was stable. Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory and Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory made slight purchases, but no purchases were reported from other factories.</p>
<p>The actual demand in the cloth market was sluggish, and customers remained hesitant. At the same time, Zhongfang Company continued to supply, and the market price fell by 250 to 500 yuan. However, in the afternoon, it was heard that the price of gold had risen, and market sentiment turned firm, with asking prices returning to their original levels.</p>
<h3>American Caustic Soda Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Delivery Rumors Cannot Be Confirmed</p>
<p>The price of caustic soda in this city once soared sharply. Recently, it was heard that a batch of American brands such as Laotou, Xiannu, and Meinu 99.5% caustic soda had been transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, causing the price to fall. Merchants mostly took advantage of the high price to sell. It is now known that the above-mentioned caustic soda has been shipped from Hanyang by boat to Shanghai, and the unloading has been going on for five days. As of yesterday, over 1,600 barrels of caustic soda have been unloaded. It is also heard that Eastgate and other ships are also loaded with industrial raw materials. Whether there is more caustic soda among them is unknown because it has not been unloaded. According to people in the industry, among the raw materials shipped this time, there are also zinc oxide powder, water glass, leather, baking soda, etc. According to a certain raw material firm, foreign merchants recently offered a large amount of caustic soda for sale, but merchants were mostly unwilling to purchase it due to the recent consistent decline in the price of caustic soda. As for the rumors that a certain foreign firm has begun to distribute caustic soda again, it has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Is Quiet</h3>
<p>Although there are currently sporadic exports of tea for overseas sales, industry insiders are not optimistic about the future. As for various types of domestic sales, sellers insist on hoarding goods, reluctant to sell them easily. However, in terms of sales, the demand in the Suzhou area has gradually been met since the Japanese plundering, and the intention to inquire has decreased. Shops on this street, aware that they cannot get what they want for the time being, have also adopted a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, the situation is generally one of quiet supply and demand, and transactions are not as enthusiastic as before the holiday, and prices fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Rice Milling Ordered to Stop Milling Refined Rice</h3>
<p>The Rice Milling Industry Association of this city issued an important announcement today, stating that according to an order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Government instructed that "It has been found that various countries are currently facing food shortages, but rice mills are still milling refined rice. According to expert research, refined rice not only lacks vitamins compared to brown rice, but also consumes too much during milling, which is not a way to save food. It has been passed by the Municipal Council to prohibit the milling of refined rice. From now on, rice mills in this city are only allowed to mill the following three types of brown rice: (1) Superior grade must have 2% rice husk, 5% red rice, and at least 10% broken rice; (2) Medium grade 2% rice husk, 10% red rice, and 20% broken rice; (3) Third grade 3% rice husk, 15% red rice, and 30% broken rice." (The rest omitted) All rice mills in this city will implement this order from today.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Remains Calm; Miscellaneous Grain Market Improves</h3>
<p>The rice market remains quiet and thin. As rice merchants have obtained legal protection, speculators are hiding in fear of punishment, and the market is calm as always. Yesterday, the prices of various grades remained unchanged. The total amount of goods registered by merchants to the market reached 1,583 *shi* (approximately 158.3 tonnes), a decrease of 459 *shi* compared to the previous market. This included 636 *shi* of white *japonica*, 267 *shi* of *bo dao* (thin rice), 80 *shi* of *yang xian*, 176 *shi* of *du xian*, 162 *shi* of *wu xian*, 22 *shi* of white *yuan*, and 240 *shi* of milled *xian*. Flour has also become more active, with prices rising by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybeans have also become firmer and show signs of improvement. Soybean cake and oil head have slightly improved interest, with prices rising by 200 to 300 yuan. Wheat bran has stopped falling and started to rise, also increasing by 200 yuan. Qingdao wheat has moved slightly, and the market is active, with high-quality goods rising by 500 to 600 yuan, and medium and lower-quality goods remaining unchanged. Sesame is scarce and selling well, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are stable. Green beans are sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Corn remains weak. After several days of sharp declines, broad beans have seen a reversal of production and sales, with a slight decrease in incoming goods, and the market has entered a stable phase.</p>
<h3>World Bank to Open Regularly on June 25</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., American News Agency, 20th] Eugene Meyer, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced today that the International Bank has set June 25 as the official date for the start of operations, and requested that the 38 member states pay 10% of their subscribed capital around November 25. The Bank also urged each member state to pay 2% of their subscribed capital in gold or US dollars around November 25 (after deducting the 0.2% that had already been paid), and another 3% in the national currency around November 25. The Bank further notified each member state that it would notify them on September 25 of the amount of principal to be paid in their own currency before November 25, which would be 5%. As for the 1/1000 of the subscribed capital that each country had previously paid in gold and US dollars, totaling approximately US$767,000,000, it would be used to pay for the administrative expenses of the Bank, which were paid by each member state at the time of signing the Bank's Articles of Agreement. Meyer pointed out that, in accordance with the agreed terms, the Bank must select an official date for the start of operations so that it could notify the collection of capital, which is the initial step for starting operations. The agreement originally stipulated that within 60 days from the date the Bank began operations, each country should pay 2% of the subscribed amount in gold or US dollars. By November 25, the subscribed amount of each member state will reach US$767,000,000, of which US$153,400,000 should be paid in gold or US dollars. Meyer said that in addition to the 10% of principal payable before November 25, the International Bank will give priority to collecting another 10% of principal in national currencies. According to the agreement, the International Bank may use 20% of the subscribed capital of each member state for direct lending, while the remaining 80% may only be collected when the Bank must clear its debts due to borrowing or guarantee procedures. The total assets subscribed by the current 38 member states of the International Bank are US$7,670,000,000.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the settlement period for the banking industry this year. It is understood that the banking business for the past six months has been more developed than the native banks, because after the opening of foreign exchange, the amount of exchange settlement deposits has increased sharply, with the average monthly total deposits reaching about 80 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Tianjin, 20th] The Tianjin-Korea trade has been resolved through consultation with the Allied authorities. Recently, a diesel ship sailed from Tianjin to Incheon, Korea for the first time, and has already set sail, carrying a large amount of Chinese medicine, cloth, groceries, summer supplies, etc.</p>
<p>[Hankou, 21st] There were originally 70 wholesale fabric dealers in this city, which decreased to 47 after the Restoration. Recently, "Xinchangxiang," "Zhongli," and "Houyu" have closed down due to their inability to maintain operations. It is said that the reason for their closure is due to the exploitation of high-interest loans and the increase in business stamp duties and other taxes, resulting in a sharp decline in business.</p>
<h3>Speculative Market Storm Is Dangerous; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Plunge; Industry Insiders and Outsiders Are Uneasy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw many people selling stocks to realize cash in order to compensate for losses caused by the renewed rise of the bond market. Outside investors, seeing the unfavorable situation, hesitated to move forward, and supply exceeded demand. At the morning opening, the high prices were: Yongsha 590 yuan, Meiya 3750 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 250 yuan, and Qinxing 190 yuan. Except for Xinguang, which was still favored due to the purchase of factory assets, the rest were mostly closed at low prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yongsha fell by 10%, Meiya fell by 20%, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell by slightly less than 20%. Xinguang has surpassed Jingfu, falling by only slightly more than 10%. Cold-market small and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down by about 10%. Although the old stocks fell less, industry insiders and outsiders were very cautious in order to avoid accidents. In the afternoon, the asking prices for Yongsha and Meiya, two popular stocks, fell by another 10%, with many people cutting losses. Outsiders should pay more attention. Foreign stocks also could not escape the exception. Those who also operated in the bond market cut losses to realize cash in order to support the precarious situation, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Yisha, after opening at 9600 yuan, continued to see supply exceeding demand and retreated to the 9000 yuan level before stabilizing. As a result, each stock fell by 10% to 15% compared to before the market closure.</p>
<h3>Early Hongniao Leaves are Offered</h3>
<p>The early lychees produced in Zhangzhou have already entered the market. Yesterday, a small number of early Hongzhi and Wuye lychees, totaling ten *dan* (approximately 500 kg), were rushed to the North Market by motorized sailing ships, so the opening price was quite high. Wuye lychees were priced at 285,000 yuan, and early Hongzhi lychees also reached 280,000 yuan. However, the quantity was small and cannot be considered the official market, otherwise, using this as a benchmark would surely result in losses.</p>
<h3>Wing On to Hold Shareholders' Meeting; Plans to Increase Capital to 1 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Wing On Co., Ltd. was originally organized and registered in accordance with the laws of the United States. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was forced to register with the puppet organization. The original directors could not perform their duties, and a group of directors elected during the war was responsible for everything. After the victory, the original directors resumed their duties. It is learned that the company's wartime directors and former secretary, M.E. Thompson, have issued notices separately, scheduling a shareholders' meeting on the 24th to discuss increasing capital, amending the articles of association, approving last year's annual report, re-electing directors, and discussing other related matters. The company's original capital was 100 million yuan in puppet currency, which has now been converted to 100 million yuan in legal currency, and an additional 900 million yuan is being added, totaling 1 billion yuan in legal currency.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Company Insists on Original Price; Medium Sugar White Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained strong. Although the Taiwan Company continued to sell, the quantity was very small and insisted on the original price of 98,000 yuan, with 2,100 bags being traded. This was a drop in the bucket and did not help the situation. Some say that such a low price will only drive the price higher. The Association's market trend continued to rise for the above reasons. In the morning, medium sugar white was 100,600 to 100,800 yuan for double bags and 100,800 to 111,300 yuan for single bags. In the afternoon, it was 110,000 to 114,000 yuan for single bags, and later remained at 110,000 yuan, with 100,800 yuan for double bags. Fourth-term warehouse receipts were 111,000 to 113,000 yuan, closing at 100,800 yuan. Numbered goods opened at 120,000 to 115,600 yuan for Xinghua white and 98,000 to 100,200 yuan for Jiuhua red, with over 300 *bao* traded, rising 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Dozens of *bao* of Zhangdiao green were 92,000 yuan, rising 10,000 yuan. The trend is unlikely to ease in the short term.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchant in the UK Returns to Investigate Business</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Mr. Xu, the manager of the Liverpool Chinese Trading Company, is about to depart to visit Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Peiping, and other places in the Far East. Mr. Xu will investigate the general trade situation and represent British and Chinese merchants to negotiate everything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spinning Spindles Will Reach 3 Million; Rayon Production Reaches One-Third; 80 Million Tons of American Cotton Will Arrive in Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently been notified that 43,000 tons of raw cotton will arrive in Kobe this month. This is the first batch of the estimated 890,000 bales imported from the United States this year, which will be used by Japanese textile factories to manufacture finished products. After the raw cotton is received, approximately 60% of its weight will be delivered to American commercial companies as finished goods for re-export in order to "pay" for the cotton. The remaining 40% will be retained by Japan for domestic use. According to a report by the International Textile Group, published by the US State Department and Allied Headquarters, the former Japanese textile industry has reached one-fifth of its pre-war cotton spinning production and one-third of its pre-war rayon production. In February 1946, the Japanese cotton spinning industry had 2,150,000 spindles installed, of which 1,115,000 were available for use. It is estimated that in January 1947, the number of spindles may increase to 3,285,000, of which the number available for use is estimated to reach 2,990,000.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Acheson's Speech: Continued Military Aid to China; Moving Towards an Orderly and Peaceful World</h3>
<p>Dean Acheson, Acting Secretary of State of the United States, delivered a speech on the 19th before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the issue of military assistance to China. The main points have been published in yesterday's newspaper. The full text is recorded below for reference.</p>
<p>I am here today to briefly describe H.R. Bill No. 6795, which will provide for military assistance and advisors to the Republic of China. Now that Japan has been defeated in the war, China, after eight years of hard fighting, must once again embark on domestic reconstruction and revival. However, the end of the war has not solved all of China's problems. Due to years of enemy occupation and war losses, one of the main problems facing the Chinese government is to restore domestic order and repatriate the large number of Japanese troops who remained in China at the time of Japan's surrender. China must strive to solve this problem and quickly find a way to fulfill its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations to maintain peace. Since the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, the Chinese army has received American supplies and equipment, and has been trained by American military missions. China has been able to continue fighting because of this, and the Chinese army has made even greater progress in its war efforts through the use of our technology and supplies. In the 22nd report submitted to Congress on Lend-Lease activities, it was stated that the materials supplied to China from the day of victory over Japan to February 1946 were worth 600 million US dollars. I think that when considering the bill for continued assistance to China, it would be worthwhile to briefly review our country's efforts to assist China in resisting Japanese aggression. This is a story that we can be proud of, and it is also enough to show that if this kind of cooperation can continue, it will be of great benefit to world peace.</p>
<p>General Marshall is now in China attempting to bring the various Chinese groups into agreement for the benefit of peace. He has made considerable progress, so we must continue to provide the assistance that General Marshall deems necessary to enable China and us to move forward together toward an orderly world under the Charter of the United Nations. Shortly before the Pearl Harbor incident, the first batch of Lend-Lease materials had been shipped to China, and Brigadier General Magruder was sent by the Department of the Army to assist China in utilizing these materials. Several months later, General Stilwell replaced Magruder, and at the request of Chairman Chiang, General Stilwell was appointed as Chairman Chiang's Chief of Staff. At this time, the flights over "The Hump" had begun, and nearly five Chinese divisions, each with 10,000 to 12,000 men, were airlifted to India, where a training center was established in the Ramgarh area. The training there included infantry, artillery, armored troops, signal corps, and transport troops. The training of the Chinese army in Burma proved to be very successful. Therefore, General Stilwell initiated the so-called "Thirty-Nine Division Plan" in China, which was later continued by General Wedemeyer. At that time, China was in a critical period. As the Chinese army was forced to retreat step by step along the coast and the main industrial areas of central China, the United States sent officers to China and established a training center in Kunming, where training similar to that in Ramgarh began. Major General Chennault, who led the famous Flying Tigers in the early stages of the war, rejoined the service of the United States Army and was ordered to go to China to assist in training the Chinese Air Force. The training of the Kunming "Y Force" was also carried out at the same time. In addition to training the Chinese Air Force, General Chennault also continued to provide effective protection to the Chinese army fighting in various parts of central China. All the training products needed for the Chinese training program, as well as the supplies we could provide to the forward Chinese army, had to be transported by transport planes across "The Hump", flying over the "dangerous" route in the Himalayan mountains. The frequency and effectiveness of this transportation were astonishing. But munitions and other equipment finally arrived in China, and the morale of the Chinese army was greatly boosted after receiving these supplies. All equipment supplied to the Chinese army was based on the Lend-Lease Act. After the end of the war, the Chinese army still needed additional equipment and supplies in order to effectively carry out the recovery work in the occupied areas. Therefore, President Truman extended the Lend-Lease supply to China until March 31, 1946. At the beginning of this year, it was found that the work of the Chinese army in recovering the occupied areas would not be completed by March 31, so the President once again extended the Lend-Lease period to China until June 30, 1946. At that time, the authority of the Lend-Lease Act will expire, as this committee knows, and we will no longer be able to continue to make agreements for the supply of equipment. China must maintain order in areas where Japanese troops are still moving, and the Chinese government must rely on well-equipped troops to fulfill its obligations to its own people and under the Charter of the United Nations. The legislation added this time is based on this reason. The State Department, with the support of the Department of the Army and Navy, has requested legislation to provide advisors and assistance to China.</p>
<h3>The Unification and Reorganization of Chinese Troops is Imminent</h3>
<p>General Marshall believes that the various Chinese military forces urgently need to be unified into one, which is the main goal of his work. He is currently working to resolve various complex issues, and we also hope to achieve complete results. The Communist troops will be part of a non-partisan national army, but so far they lack sufficient organization, training, and equipment. Therefore, the leaders of the Communist troops have requested (and General Marshall has agreed) to receive short-term American training and a minimum amount of equipment before the reorganization. Any assistance related to this decision in the coming months will contribute to the military plan. Our work is related to a very large army. The strength of the Chinese National Army is about 300 divisions, with each division numbering between 10,000 and 12,000. According to recent estimates, the strength of the Communist troops is equivalent to one-quarter of the National Army. Resolving various related issues and carrying out the reorganization work requires considerable authority. The bill under consideration will generate this authority. According to the reorganization plan proposed by General Marshall, the number of this large army will be greatly reduced, and the reorganized army will be a well-trained peacetime army. Its strength will meet our ideals. If General Marshall's proposal is implemented, and we continue to fulfill the obligations recommended by General Marshall that we should write down, China will have a powerful combat organization unprecedented in the past. This combat organization will also meet China's peacetime needs. The reorganization work will achieve great results: a huge workforce will be able to engage in rebuilding the recovered areas and post-war agricultural affairs to meet the urgent needs to deal with famine. A large workforce will be transformed for the development of Chinese industry. The Chinese government will also save the wasteful expenses of maintaining a large and poorly organized army. Before the reorganization work is completed, the Chinese government will have no hope of effective and orderly administration. Effective and orderly administration is a necessary condition for China to curb inflation and carry out post-war work.</p>
<h3>Fulfilling Promises and Assisting in Building Military Institutions</h3>
<p>The most important part of the outline proposed by General Marshall is to send military advisory representatives to China. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek made this request several months ago. This is the core of the outline, and authority regarding this outline is currently being requested. After consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department, a plan has been drawn up for this military advisory group and approved by the President. The President, in accordance with his emergency powers, instructed us: the organization of the advisory group should be temporary in nature, but there are no additional regulations, and the duration of the group's existence has not been determined. Therefore, in this situation, a much-needed long-range plan cannot be developed. The current military advisory delegation will include 750 U.S. Army personnel and 250 Navy personnel. General Marshall believes that these 1,000 people will help him implement plans to modernize the Chinese army and determine the quantity of supplies and equipment that the Chinese army should have.</p>
<p>I must now solemnly state that the State Department has a great interest in facilitating General Marshall's implementation of his plan.</p>
<p>This proposal should be made into law as soon as possible. I firmly believe that this is extremely necessary and also very beneficial to the United States. This measure will enable the U.S. government to fulfill the promise made by the President on December 15th of last year, that is, to assist China in establishing military institutions, so that the country can bear the national and international responsibilities related to maintaining peace and order. As the President stated in that declaration: an unorganized and divided China is a destructive force for world stability and peace, and will invite external interference in its own problems. On the other hand, a well-trained and adequately equipped peace army of considerable size (as suggested by General Marshall in his military adjustment plan) will be of great benefit to peace and eliminating internal strife, and will also enable China to fulfill its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.

<h3>Municipal School Reservation Fee</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: My daughter is studying at the First Municipal Girls' Middle School. She returned home the other day and said that the principal announced that all students preparing to continue their studies at the school next semester must pay a reservation fee of 5,000 yuan per person, and must pay it within two days, otherwise they will be considered as having automatically withdrawn from school. Although I am a small civil servant and have no spare money, because my daughter urged me so urgently and I was afraid that she would lose the opportunity to study, I had to borrow 5,000 yuan from relatives and friends to pay. Collecting reservation fees from students was originally one of the methods used by Shanghai private schools to raise money. Since municipal schools do not charge tuition fees, what is the basis for the school's collection of reservation fees from students this time, and the amount is as high as 5,000 yuan? Has it been approved by the Education Administration Bureau in advance? I hereby appeal to the education authorities on behalf of poor parents, hoping to thoroughly investigate and stop this practice. Shao Jinzhi, June 19th.</p>
<p>Waterwheels on the Bank of the Yellow River in Lanzhou (Photographed and sent by Jian Qiu)</p>
<h3>The Undercurrent in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>— Guo Jianqiu</p>
<p>Lanzhou Airmail, 13th</p>
<p>When the great sandstorm from the Han-Gerry region stopped roaring, a small city wall emerged from the wind and sand. The white poplars and pear trees on the banks of the Yellow River are also verdant. People know that spring in the borderlands has passed. When the rhododendrons in the deep mountains used their last elegy to send off spring, the last petals of the peonies also withered away. What follows is the scorching summer and the abundant melons and fruits.</p>
<p>Where is summer in Lanzhou? On both banks of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Look: On the river bank, the giant wheels of the water army, along with the rolling torrent of the Yellow River in summer, have begun their work again. Since the early arrival of winter in the borderlands, they have been having a very long dream for several months! It dreamed that the Yellow River would turn into a silver dragon in the cold wind, and then freeze on the earth without a sound. The people on the shore huddled in their cave dwellings, enduring the tyranny of winter in dilapidated mud houses. The strong pungent odor caused by burning horse manure for warmth enveloped the cities and villages. Of course, it often dreamed of the brightly polished white copper charcoal stoves and the aroma of hot white liquor in the homes of officials, merchants, and heads of households, but what could it do? When the frozen silver dragon is resurrected in the early summer sun, and begins to flow and sing again, it can also start its work again. They sing, letting the beads of sweat fly in all directions, drawing the water from the river to the high embankment, letting them gurgle through the sandy banks, through the fields. Let those farmers who huddled for a winter in the cold wind unfold a piece of hope of life in their cobblestone-stacked melon or wheat fields.</p>
<p>But summer in Lanzhou does not just stay in the suburbs. In the city, on the streets, in the ice cream parlors of old Hui people shouting loudly with white caps on their heads, on the strong bare legs of those mixed-race girls, and on the exposed left arms of lamas in fur robes, you can also see the footsteps of summer.</p>
<p>Local newspapers say that Lanzhou's summer this year has a high heat not seen in twelve years. But outsiders can't feel it. When they recall the summer days in the past, on the bamboo buildings like steamers in Chongqing, on the banks of the Qinhuai River exuding heat, those days of swallowing ice and waving fans, yet still sweating like rain, Lanzhou is happy. The indoor temperature in the luxurious mansions is only about 20 degrees Celsius. Inexpensive natural ice is delivered to homes every day. Canned fruits that have poured into Shanghai and local grape juice, after being chilled, are also wonderful products for cooling off in the summer. Moreover, in another month or two, the drunken melons, westerly winds, honey peaches, big apples, and crabapples that give Lanzhou the reputation of being a fruit city will also be on the market.</p>
<p>Lanzhou's summer is calm and not too hot. But it has a unique and bold border style. For example, in the calm hot sun, a black cloud suddenly appears, and it may fill half the sky in an instant. Then the strong wind rises, and the sand slams against your mouth and nose, making it impossible to breathe. It may also be mixed with a few large raindrops, pinging and popping and breaking all the window paper. If there is also electricity, be careful of your head. But don't worry, maybe in ten minutes, maybe in twenty minutes, everything will be in the past, and it will still be sunny and warm.</p>
<p>So is the weather, so is human affairs. For example, you are living a peaceful life, when suddenly the news comes that a gang of bandits is fleeing from the Gansu-Ningxia border area to Hexi; otherwise, it is discovered that water has climbed on horseback and returned to the bandits; otherwise, the bandits in Huajialing have come out again, so take ten cars less.</p>
<p>But none of this can affect the ongoing border construction work. Summer time, which is uniform throughout the country, has long been implemented, but the working hours here are not affected at all, and seem even more intense. Look: At the Engineers' Festival, the engineers who have the important task of developing the border areas have just finished a big meeting, and the Association of Scientific Workers has also been established. The electro-educational education of the Science Education Museum is said to have been launched on a large scale. The film drama troupe of the Political Department of the Military Command is also preparing to advance to the barren Gobi Desert. What Qilian Mountains survey teams, geological survey teams, hydropower exploration teams, Qingxin highway surveying teams, Tianlan Railway Lintao branch line surveying teams, and Lanzhou to Dihua copper cable line installation teams are all going out to work in all directions. Lanzhou University is actively preparing, and it also wants to add an engineering college. The authorities are trying to hire professors.</p>
<p>But all these efforts cannot save a declining undercurrent. This undercurrent includes two forces: one is the flood of industrial decline that has been hard-won, and the other is the flow of people rolling eastward by refugees, righteous people, gold prospectors in the frontier, and rebuilders of old homes after the Longhai passage opened. These two forces converge into a large flood, which is currently washing and impacting on this barren and dry loess plateau. If there are no appropriate measures to correct it and differentiate it, it may be like the Northwest Highway every summer, which will be washed into sections by huge mountain torrents.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Recover Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>"I would rather fight with a rogue than talk to a rascal." Fighting with a rogue is done with fists and feet. Whoever loses and whoever wins is clean and crisp, clean and tidy; talking to a rascal is just rambling, crooked and twisted, dragging and dawdling, and just talking nonsense. This is probably the kind of distinction that we Chinese make between the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>People who have lived in Hong Kong can say that they are satisfied with the climate, etc., especially in winter; but no one dares to accept the colonial policies of the rulers.</p>
<p>Let’s not talk about the old debts of the past. Taking the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan as an example, in the Pingshan Airport incident, the Hong Kong authorities still maintained the face of the British Empire, which made us angry! And this time, the suspension of the National Daily News is even worse, simply absurd. We absolutely cannot tolerate it. We now resolutely put forward a slogan, "Recover Hong Kong and Kowloon."</p>
<p>The lease term of Hong Kong and Kowloon has already expired. When the unequal treaties were abolished in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), this issue was not resolved due to the relationship of fighting side by side, which we truly regret; in the UK, frankly speaking, that is shameless! That is a rascal!</p>
<p>Mark 12 says:</p>
<p>"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has received the punishment it deserves in this war. May I ask, what reason does the United Kingdom today, in Europe, in the Near East, and even in India, have to put on the airs of a bully? In Hong Kong, can it do whatever it wants, show off the power of the master, despise our laws, insult our government, and enslave our people? Bah!</p>
<p>No negotiations can be conducted. Simply and directly, take it back. As for those bad guys who harbor traitors, no matter what country they are from, arrest them and then punish them.</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Be a U.S. Congressman</h3>
<p>— Chuanqiu</p>
<p>Voters Send Up to 60,000 Letters a Day - Washing Clothes and Picking Up Stones Must All Be Performed</p>
<p>The 435 men and women congressmen in the U.S. House of Representatives and the 96 senators have different hobbies and habits, but at about ten o'clock every morning, they almost all do the same job, which is reading letters. Congressmen may be absent from committee meetings, not vote, or not attend meetings, but they must open their letters.</p>
<p>During normal times, mail is delivered to the Capitol four times a day, and on Saturdays and holidays it is reduced to twice a day, with an average of about 60,000 pieces of mail per day. One congressman recalled that 40 years ago, his grandfather was also in Congress at that time, and he hired a secretary to help answer all the letters. Today, each congressman has to hire three to four clerks to cope. In 1907, the average congressman from a major city in the Midwest received 12 letters a day. But in 1946, even though the population of the city had decreased, the congressmen received a total of 125 letters a day.</p>
<p>Approximately four out of every five letters ask about or support an event. Each congressman's work is often aroused by strange requests. One woman wrote to ask for stones from the Little Poodoo Meek River to increase her collection. Another voter learned that his son was about to be discharged from the army and returned to Washington, so he wrote to his congressman, saying that he had sent two sets of clothes and asked the congressman to help him hang them in the office, ready to be handed over to his beloved son upon arrival!</p>
<p>But, in fact, the letters received by congressmen are, on the whole, of great value to their contributions. No congressman can be aware of the content and advantages and disadvantages of so many proposals. Many individuals and groups such as the American University Women's Association and the Economic Construction Association conduct detailed studies of various issues, so their letters are well-reasoned and very helpful to the congressmen's thinking. However, congressmen are in a two-sided position. He not only represents his state in Washington, but also represents Washington in his state. For example, last December, Congressman Spearman from Alebaugh received many letters from his state expressing widespread dissatisfaction with the army's reinstatement and opposition to universal military training. Spearman was originally a member of the Congressional Military Committee. He certainly knew more facts than his voters. Therefore, taking advantage of the convenience of returning home for Christmas, he gave four lectures on these issues, which finally changed the views of the entire state's population. If Spearman only used the opinions provided by the letters from the voters of his state as the standard for voting, this would seem to be democratic at first glance, but what he did was include representing the government, which is a two-sided job, not a one-sided one. (Translated from American Freedom Magazine)</p>
<h3>Afraid of Death and Love of Money</h3>
<p>— Chuanqiu</p>
<p>A Londoner boarded a train in Edinburgh and sat next to an elderly Scotsman with a worried face. When the train reached the first station, his companion hurried off the train, ran to the platform, and then hurried back, panting. The second station and the third station were the same. After the third station, the Londoner couldn't help but become curious and asked the reason. The elderly Scotsman replied, "I am going to London to ask a specialist doctor to diagnose my heart. He said it was very bad. If I don't take good care of myself, I will be in danger of losing my life at any time, so I buy a station ticket back one stop at a time!"</p>
<h3>Lament in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>I seem to have an inseparable relationship with illness. I had already spent my younger years suffering from illness, and in these past eight or nine years, I have brought a lot of long, almost inhumanly tasting bitterness and cruelty from illness (I dare not say it was given to me by the war). This bitterness and cruelty once broke my family, starved me, killed people, and injured my ankles. What's more, for a longer period of time, I used two copper-coin-worth of cakes to fill my stomach. I only had the financial resources to eat that much twice a day, and that was considered the morning and evening meals of the day. Fortunately, I have not had to gnaw on grass roots or chew on leaves, which can be considered "favored by heaven." But as a result, my body has become even worse, and illness has been entangled with me for a long time, always staying with each other, sharing mornings and evenings, and my wife does not have such a deep feeling. But, because of this particularly affectionate fellow, illness, what I may get is a kind of "Wen Yuan Xiaoke" (wasting disease) weakening. There was indeed a time when I couldn't even afford the cost of two cakes a day. In particular, I will never forget that one time I fainted and fell under the cliff of a mountain road, with only a breath left. My soul seemed to float on the swaying treetops, and it was as if I had already attained enlightenment, wandering in the blue sky, and my mind was flying freely. Only this stinky skin was left, still lying under the cliff with only a breath left.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although I have an indissoluble bond with illness, I have already forged an indestructible body. This little bit of tribulation cannot trouble me much. Soon the illness temporarily bid me farewell. In fact, it was not farewell, but just hiding inside. However, for me, I really like it when it has such a short period of hiding, so that I don't have to spend too much effort on my physical strength when I go to find cakes. So I had what I considered comfortable days: writing a few hundred words, exchanging it for a ration that was more abundant than cakes, and naturally, I also had the strength to mend the only pair of leather shoes with holes in the bottom so that they looked like they were newly made.</p>
<p>I had such comfortable days for a while, just like when my wife was not around, leisurely and comfortable. However, as the saying goes, "without enemies, there are no reunions." Illness always has this karmic relationship with me in this life, and it is difficult to separate.</p>
<p>Today I am sick again. My personal thought is that I just caught a cold last night, and at the same time, I wrote a few hundred more words, and my spirit was too depleted. So when I got up in the morning, I felt dizzy and weak, and after crawling out of bed, I was forced to fall back to bed. I don't really believe in doctors, whether they are Western or Chinese. In fact, modern medicine cannot cure my illness, because it has this karmic relationship with me. Before the karmic relationship is over, illness is my unlovable but unavoidable lover, and its terrible affection for me is to make me disappear both physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>However, perhaps that is saying it too seriously. A little cold, is it worth making such a fuss about? However, it has to be said that for someone who has absolutely no good nutrition, illness is not just "a maggot in the bone!" But, this will not cause anything for me. Anyway, I'm used to it, and letting it stay in the disease for a long time can also be a little quieter. At least, the feelings of the world will not hit my heart. It's just a pity that there will be problems with the cakes, otherwise, I really want to close the door and get sick for years and months!</p>
<h3>Serial Comic: Sanmao Joins the Army (Forty-one)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Small World</p>
<h3>Gualü Lychee: 100,000 Yuan Per Catty</h3>
<p>Two Gualü lychee trees in Youyuan Monastery, Zengcheng, Guangdong, whose products were "world-renowned" tribute items, were priced at several hundred catties per fruit before the war. During the occupation, the Japanese army used them to "contribute to the Japanese Emperor" and "senior generals" in various places. This year's output is only seven and a half catties, priced at 100,000 yuan per catty, or 5,000 yuan per fruit. Before the fruits ripened, they were already "registered" and sold out. Later arrivals offered 150,000 yuan but could not obtain them. At a time of famine in Huguang (Hubei and Hunan), this is a small, ironic contrast.</p>
<p>Also, among fruits, mangoes, although those produced in Luzon are considered top-grade, the Xia Mao mangoes of Panyu are so prized that while Luzon mangoes sell for about 1,000 yuan each in the market, Xia Mao mangoes sell for 4,000 to 5,000 yuan each, and are presented in brocade boxes, displayed ostentatiously, with a touch of rising in value a hundredfold after entering a wealthy household. Despite this, supply still cannot meet demand. In light of this, who would dare to believe that there are forty or fifty people on the streets of Guangzhou who are starving?</p>
<p>The director of the Taiping Township Production Association in Changshou County, Sichuan, suddenly came up with a method to raise a large sum of money. On June 1st, he convened a meeting of the Bao chiefs (local security chiefs) and gentry, stating roughly: "Recently, I took the lead in mobilizing the villagers to raise four or two ducks per household. The ducks will be provided by the association. After the ducks grow to three catties, those raising four ducks will return two, and those raising two will return one. The association will sell these ducks, and the income will be invested to generate interest, using the interest to offset the county government's collection of various taxes in the future, as well as the funds that the township should raise. Hereafter, the villagers will never have to pay any exorbitant taxes. Those who do not fulfill this obligation will not have their interests protected," and so on. As a reader, I cannot help but write that the people of Taiping Township, Changshou County, are truly leaving a "long legacy." From now on, we will see "Changshou County becoming a Long Life County, and the people of Taiping Township becoming people of Great Peace."</p>
<p>According to a Chengdu newspaper report: "An employee of a certain office has been absent from work for three days recently, without asking for leave. When he came to work on the fourth day, the supervisor asked him. He replied, 'I have no money to buy rice. I haven't eaten for three days. My wife is crying and my children are wailing. How can I come to work? Today, I borrowed 700 yuan from a friend to buy sesame cakes to fill my stomach.'" He burst into tears as he spoke. This can also be seen as an example of lamentable hardship.</p>
<p>Short Items</p>
<h3>Five Sons Succeeding, Lacking Only One Son</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>A piece of good news that is unrelated to me: Commander Tang has sent fifty officers to Shanghai to investigate the matter of military personnel occupying houses left behind by Japanese residents. It is said that many occupied houses will be ordered to be vacated. Commander Tang is quite harsh in handling cases. Recently, a military man named Ma Weiliang was executed by firing squad in Wuxi for forcibly occupying a house in Shanghai. I believe that the results of this investigation will lead those who should not be residing [in those houses] to obediently move out. Otherwise...</p>
<p>The Xiangshan Popular Daily, offended the county middle school, and was interfered with by the school, forced to cease publication, the editorial department was destroyed, and even the president Wu Baozong was detained. A middle school is acting so recklessly, to such an extent. In the future, barbershops, bathhouses, the little boys, the little girls, can also rise up and follow suit. Will there be any of the news industry left? Alas, freedom, alas, freedom of speech!</p>
<p>I heard that the cost of living in Macau is extremely low, renting a house is no problem at all, and the rent is especially cheap. Friends! Aren't you suffering from the difficulty of living in Shanghai? You can go to Macau! I hope everyone goes! But perhaps I will not be able to accompany you, because I have already secured a loft. I feel quite comfortable with the small space.</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was news from Hong Kong: "Guangdong Province will soon release a list of three batches of traitors, totaling 300 names. Recently, the traitors have been busy sending cars, houses, women, and gold..." "Five sons succeeding," lacking only one son, actually having these four, why still need a face.</p>
<h3>Leisure</h3>
<p>— Yu Chuangshuo</p>
<p>Minding one's own business is the best way to enjoy blessings. In this fragrant summer season, having a pot of tea in the afternoon, although there is no flower fragrance, hearing the bird's song, how leisurely! How leisurely!</p>
<h3>Meat as Cheap as Dirt</h3>
<p>— Fang Cao</p>
<p>Meat products, in the eyes of today's people, are such attractive things! The middle and lower classes mostly sigh, "Three months without knowing the taste of meat." The reason is naturally the unspeakable expensiveness of meat prices. Now, the price per ounce of meat is equivalent to the price per ounce of gold before the war. It can be said: "Meat is as expensive as gold."</p>
<p>But the pork in Huangzhou during the Song Dynasty was as cheap as dirt, a world of difference compared to the value of a piglet today! If you don't believe it, please read Su Dongpo's "Eating Pork Poem:"</p>
<p>"Huangzhou has good pork, its price as cheap as dirt. The rich don't want to eat it, the poor don't know how to cook it. Cook it slowly over a low fire, with a little water, and when the fire is just right, it will be delicious. Get up every day and have a bowl, eat your fill and don't love it too much."</p>
<p>Such cheap pork, yet no one wants to eat it, truly a strange thing. Only Su Dongpo eats it as a snack every day. He tells you "don't love it too much," but I'm afraid you can't help but drool!</p>
<h3>Social Services - Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Bai Zhongxun asks: I have been in love with a certain woman for more than three years, and our feelings are quite in harmony, but her father is dissatisfied and constantly obstructs and destroys our feelings. However, our wills have become even stronger. Seeing that it is difficult for her father to agree, and since we can both support ourselves, is it legal to have a wedding without a presiding officiant? If a presiding officiant is necessary, can we ask a friend to act as an agent? Will the agent be held liable to her father? Is it permissible not to notify her family when holding the wedding? What are the procedures for completing a legal marriage in a simple manner? Please provide public guidance. I would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin replies] Marriage between adult men and women does not require the consent of both parents, but a public ceremony and at least two witnesses are necessary. Other things, such as the presence or absence of a presiding officiant, are not essential.</p>
<p>(2) Zhou Da asks: I have a girlfriend, and our feelings have reached a solid and unbreakable level. However, she is a widow who has been married for four months and lost her husband, and she is in an old-fashioned family in the countryside. I have a few difficulties. Please teach me: (1) Has the marital relationship been extinguished with the loss for two years, or is it still continuing? (2) Is it illegal to marry someone without removing the Gengtie (marriage horoscope)? Can the parents-in-law use this as an excuse to interfere? (3) In the countryside, it is customary for widows to remarry to pay a Gengtie removal fee. Is this fee normal? (4) What steps are most legal and simple?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin replies] (1) Her husband's death extinguishes the marital relationship. It has been more than six months, and in accordance with Article 987 of the Civil Code, remarriage is not contrary to the rules. (2) If the woman is over 20 years of age and marries someone, the parents-in-law may not interfere. Whether or not the Gengtie is removed is irrelevant. (3) The Gengtie removal fee cannot be considered legitimate. (4) If you marry her, there must be a public ceremony and at least two witnesses.</p>
<p>(3) Ling asks: I married a woman in Huile Village in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and it has been five years since then. Our feelings have been very good, and we have a son and a daughter. However, unexpectedly, after returning to Shanghai from the countryside after the victory [of the war], her attitude suddenly changed. She often stays out all night, not thinking about the family with a husband and children. I have repeatedly advised her, but she does not listen. She even made her own decisions and secretly went back to her original profession when I was not in Shanghai. Now that I have discovered this, she has instead proposed a divorce. I have always treated her well, and her mother and sisters are supported by me. She is only over twenty years old this year, and someone must be instigating her behind her back or enticing her. I ask whether the madam of the brothel has suspicion of inducement? For the sake of my reputation, I do not want her to engage in this shameless profession again, so as not to hinder my future. If she still does not listen to my advice, I plan to send her to the Jiliang Institute (a reformatory) for reformation, or what should I do? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Fu Kuang replies] If the woman is not your formal spouse but only a family member, and has already reached the age of twenty, the madam of the brothel does not constitute the crime of inducement. If it is for the sake of your reputation, you can only give up your past feelings and break off relations with her.</p>

<h3>Hero (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Ever since the Yellow River became the forefront of national defense, the common people on the north bank have been like the unfortunate ones excluded from the restricted area during the winter defense period. Their lives and properties seemed to be hanging at the crossroads, completely losing their guarantee. Although there were still troops, police chiefs, and various institutions and personnel that a county in a precarious situation should have in some mountain villages on the southern slope of Zhongtiao Mountain, those people were as pitiful as those common people, worrying all day and night.</p>
<p>However, great adversity can precisely invigorate a nation. Often, in extremely harsh environments, ideal flowers will bloom. This group of people, like islanders in an isolated county overseas, have formed a close cooperation between the military and the people for their own safety, better than in other war zones.</p>
<p>Not for the sake of winning medals, nor for seeking government praise. But for themselves, for their own homeland, everyone is doing their best to defend against enemy invasion, and even wants to find ways to eliminate the enemy's threat. As long as there is an opportunity, every common person is willing to go to the front line and kill a few devils. But where are the devils? They are hiding in airplanes equipped with steel armor, flying high in the sky, showing off their power. They can act wildly in the sky above the Yellow River's banks, which lacks air defense equipment. Bombs, machine guns, they can hit me, but I have no way to hit them.</p>
<p>Devils, devils! Just being sneaky like this, using superior weapons to attack defenseless common people. This kind of behavior can hardly be considered heroic!</p>
<p>Fan Zengguo is a young farmer from Jinshatan in Pinglu County, southern Shanxi Province. He grew up by the river and works in the fields at the foot of Zhongtiao Mountain. He always advocates being fair and upright, holding the principle of "I will not attack unless attacked." What he sees and what he gets close to are also a group of honest and straightforward farmers. He is deeply disgusted with the brutal invasion of the devils, and especially indignant at the devils' unfair tactics.</p>
<p>"One day, may heaven open its eyes and make one of them fall down! I will personally capture that pilot and bite him three times!" When he squats in the mountain gully to avoid the air raid alert, he often looks at the enemy planes flying high and low everywhere in the sky, vowing fiercely. But heaven just doesn't open its eyes, and not a single one has ever fallen. Even when flying low, they have never been caught by the treetops or telephone poles. It's really hateful!</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Li! That plane just now flew so low, why didn't you give it a shot?"</p>
<p>Fan Zengguo asked Li Mingxing, a private first class in the sixth company of the second battalion of the security regiment, who was serving as a lookout post twenty yards away, angrily.</p>
<p>Li Mingxing snorted and said:</p>
<p>"You think it's low, but you didn't see how fast it was flying! If rifles could hit it, people would have shot it down long ago."</p>
<p>"It's good to scare it a bit! Otherwise, it will come even lower tomorrow, and its wings will almost touch your hat!"</p>
<p>That's right! Even if you can't hit it, it's good to give it a warning and vent your frustration.</p>
<p>The next day afternoon, the air raid alert came again! Five planes, rumbling and roaring! They flew around the mountains and valleys like five bald-headed eagles.</p>
<p>"Old Li! Do it! That gray-white one is the lowest. When it flies over again, give it a 'health pill' to taste."</p>
<p>"Okay!" Li Mingxing, lying on the opposite hill, gently climbed up a little more, leaned against a tree stump, put the rifle butt on his chest, and pointed the muzzle at the sky.</p>
<p>"Bang!"</p>
<p>The plane kept flying, obviously not hit.</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang!" Shots were also fired from other places.</p>
<p>"Gak gak gak gak!" The machine gun on the plane fired. What a disaster! Quickly hide in the cave.</p>
<p>After a while, the sound of the planes gradually faded away. Fan Zengguo crawled out of the cave and looked around, suddenly seeing an airplane parked on Jinshatan.</p>
<p>"Haha! It really hit!" He couldn't help but shout, and rushed down the hill, heading straight for Jinshatan.</p>
<p>What was parked on the beach was indeed a Mitsubishi attack aircraft. The number was 306. The pilot, Second Lieutenant Yamada Kiyoshi, and Sergeant Major Omori Kiyozō were anxiously inspecting the engine. There was nothing wrong with the engine, and the fuel tank was not leaking, but half of the propeller was missing. What to do? Yamada Kiyoshi stomped his feet impatiently, while Omori Kiyozō still wanted to try to take off.</p>
<p>"It's no use! It's no use! Don't waste your time! Hurry up and unload the machine gun! If the Chinese surround us in a moment, we're all done for!" Yamada Kiyoshi said while putting the map in his pocket.</p>
<p>"What about this plane? If the Chinese get it and replace the propeller, it's still a good plane!" Omori Kiyozō wrung his hands, almost wanting to cry.</p>
<p>"Stop nagging! Buddy! Escaping is the priority! I'm leaving first! Straight north, over Zhongtiao Mountain and we'll be saved!" Yamada Kiyoshi said and rushed up the hill with his pistol in hand. He happened to meet Fan Zengguo coming down from the hill. But Fan Zengguo had already seen that the devil was carrying a weapon in his hand, and if he went up to meet him, he would surely be shot. So he flashed to the side of the road, not letting him see him. Yamada Kiyoshi was neither familiar with the road nor in a panic, just wanting to get to the mountain and find a hidden place to hide. But unexpectedly, he met Guan Yu on Huarong Road. Suddenly, from behind, he grabbed him around the waist and embraced him tightly, while starting to shout loudly:</p>
<p>"Catch the bandit! Everyone come and catch the thief!"</p>
<p>Yamada Kiyoshi was already terrified, as if in a tiger's mouth. Unexpectedly, at the end of his rope, he encountered an ambush. Thinking he was more dead than alive, he didn't want to return alive. Suddenly, he heard the person who had captured him still howling like a wolf. Although this cry sounded terrifying, it also proved that the other party was a common person with no combat experience, no companions, and no weapons. So he rekindled his one in a million hope, and began to struggle, trying to get his pistol, but the pistol was held by Fan Zengguo. No matter how desperately Yamada Kiyoshi struggled like a flood dragon, Fan Zengguo only remembered the lesson that it is easy to let a tiger out but difficult to catch it again, so no matter what, he had to use his original strength to fight him. And Yamada Kiyoshi? He was holding on to his last hope, using all his strength, wanting to break free from the other's grasp.</p>
<p>The two men twisted and fought on the hillside. The cries spread to Jinshatan, and Omori Kiyozō also saw it. He saw that his superior was already in the mouth of the tiger, so he couldn't care less about dismantling the machine gun, wanting to come and save him. But he was unwilling to give the plane, which could be used with a little repair, to his enemy. So, just as he was about to run to save Yamada Kiyoshi, he took out his pistol and fired a volley at the fuel tank. Gasoline ignited, and the plane burst into flames. Then he ran up the hill to save Yamada Kiyoshi.</p>
<p>At that time, Li Mingxing and other common people also discovered Fan Zengguo's scene of capturing a tiger barehanded in the mountain gully, and wanted to come and help him. But there was a ditch in between, and they couldn't get close for a while. Instead, Omori Kiyozō arrived first, walking behind Fan Zengguo, pointing his pistol at the back of his head, intending to end his life with one shot. But when he pulled the trigger, it didn't fire! He pulled it again, and it still didn't fire. Looking closely, the chamber was empty, because this fool had fired all the bullets into the plane's fuel tank.</p>
<p>Li Mingxing saw that the other party had help, and thought that Fan Zengguo would suffer, so he rushed to climb over the hill even more urgently. Unexpectedly, just at this time, the four planes that had just gone back flew back, rumbling and flying back and forth along the Yellow River - obviously looking for their companions. Omori Kiyozō waved his hand and shouted desperately, but those four stupid birds circled twice and didn't find the three of them fighting in the mountain gully. They only saw the blazing fire on Jinshatan, thinking that they had heroically sacrificed themselves, so they turned around and flew northwest.</p>
<p>When Omori Kiyozō saw that the rescuers had gone far away, and Li Mingxing was about to arrive, he had to intensify his attack on Fan Zengguo. He didn't have time to reload his pistol, so he could only hit Fan Zengguo's head with the pistol butt. The iron rod hit flesh and blood, making a hole with each blow, and a burst of blood spurted out. Pain! Needless to say, it was definitely painful. But the more it hurt, the less he could let go, like welding firmly together, the tighter the grip became.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Mingxing also arrived. The sentries on other hills, the village chiefs, the county magistrate, the company commander, and the adjutant, all arrived one after another. Omori Kiyozō saw that the situation was not right, so he had to abandon Fan Zengguo and Yamada Kiyoshi and escape alone, because there were enemies on three sides, he could only escape to the Yellow River. Did he want to swim across the river? No! He didn't think or plan at all, just instinctively wanted to escape. Like a cat, he blindly ran away.</p>
<p>The Yellow River became more turbulent in the middle reaches, and it was difficult to lift his feet in the mud and sand. It symbolized his fate, and the future was hopeless. However, Omori Kiyozō was still struggling to move forward in the hopeless river.</p>
<p>"Bang!" A patrol officer shot him in the calf. This stopped his delusions.</p>
<p>Over here, Yamada Kiyoshi was also rescued from Fan Zengguo's grasp by Li Mingxing.</p>
<p>The county magistrate directed the police to tie up these two prisoners who had fallen from the sky with ropes, and Fan Zengguo, supported by two policemen, went to the city together.</p>
<p>The city gate was crowded with women watching the fun. Everyone wanted to see Fan Zengguo. Fan Zengguo became the Wu Song in the drama. However, Wu Song fought a tiger, and Fan Zengguo captured two wolves. The wolves hung their heads and followed behind. Fan Zengguo's head was still dripping with bright blood.</p>
<p>"Hero!"</p>
<p>The county magistrate gave a thumbs up and praised the common people watching the fun triumphantly. The common people also nodded in approval:</p>
<p>"Good lad! True hero!"</p>
<h3>Dreaming of Hometown</h3>
<p>— Fei Cun</p>
<p>Last night I dreamt of my hometown. It was still that tall Pine Mountain. Several white sheep were grazing in the green woods; on the path from the village, the cool and peaceful Earth God and Earth Goddess were smiling at the farmers resting their feet. How much emotion must there be in that smile: "The young grow strong, and the strong grow old, and what about the old?" Beside the road was a mulberry field. From the gaps in the mulberry trees, one could vaguely see the lively stream carrying small boats and bamboo rafts. Look! Under the sun, the dazzling silver color of honey-colored fish splashing and turning over! On the opposite bank of the river was a golden beach. Who was that girl squatting by the pier under the bridge, washing rice and clothes? Be careful of the naughty children throwing stones next to you, causing a "thump" and splashing water that wets your black pants and white short shirt. At the end of the beach was another vast mulberry field, behind which faintly floated the smoke from the kitchen chimneys. That was the hometown of the washing girls, the hometown of the naughty children, my hometown!</p>
<p>It was so intimate, yet it seemed so distant. When I timidly stepped into his arms, none of the people coming and going were familiar to me. It was only a separation of six or seven years! It wasn't like a young child leaving home and growing old far away! I rushed with full enthusiasm into the house of Grandpa Cai Kang, whom I knew best. Here, I finally saw the people I knew well: Grandpa Cai Kang, Uncle Zhi, Aunt Yue Di... They were all there. I almost wanted to hug them and tell them how much I had thought of them in these past few years. Strangely, they were all cold, as if they had just seen me five minutes ago. I walked towards Grandpa Cai Kang and said, "Grandpa, I'm back." He looked at my long gown and said, "Didn't you get rich? Those of us from Zhang Village who go out all make a fortune!" I asked, "I heard that Grandma has passed away?" He grunted, "Didn't you become an official either? You study until you graduate from university and don't become an official?" Seeing my blushing face, he walked away biting his dry cigarette holder.</p>
<p>So I reached out to Uncle Zhi. I said, "Let's arm wrestle again, like we used to do when we were in elementary school." But he also looked at my long gown and said contemptuously, "What strength do you have besides moving your pen? Let me tell you, it's not the time when long gowns are omnipotent anymore. My fists and my hoes are the true creators of the new world." I turned my pleading gaze to Aunt Yue Di, hoping to get the gentle caress I had once received from her, but she was silently shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Yue Di, Feng Gu, why are you sad? Let me play the erhu again, and you sing a song again."</p>
<p>"Who has the time for that?" Yue Di glanced at me sideways: "Rice costs 60,000 yuan per stone, and mulberry leaves are also expensive. We Zhang Village people live off silk, but silk just can't be sold for money. It seems we can only starve to death, heh heh heh." Then she started crying, "heh heh heh".</p>
<p>I woke up with resentment, just as this metropolis was falling into a deep sleep. Even the last peddler carrying wontons had gone home to sleep, leaving behind darkness, silence, and nightmares. The night was like a boundless ocean. I felt my body floating up, floating up, drifting away, like a discarded, withered, yellow vegetable leaf.</p>
<h3>Night Walker</h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>The night walker, bared his ankles, and forever strides into the world of darkness.</p>
<p>There is not a paper lantern in his hand, nor a relative behind him; the lonely figure forever allows only the feet that are bleeding to trample.</p>
<p>No one compels him, yet he wants to walk; no one orders him, yet he wants to walk. In his stomach-filled, yet resolute heart, forever gestates a hope: He wants to walk out of this world of darkness.</p>
<p>From this piece of mud, to that piece of mud! From this small bridge, to that small bridge! From this village to that village! From this provincial city to that provincial city! He has walked all over the world, and also knows the world; time steals past in his footsteps. How many eras have passed? He only knows that his once rosy cheeks have turned dry and ugly, fleeting hope has turned into arduous trouble, and how much fresh, youthful blood has congealed in the cold, hard earth.</p>
<p>He recognizes: This world is dark, is selfish, is self-abandoning; just like this moonless and starless night. But he has to keep walking forward, even though the darkness in front of him is crossed by a river, a high mountain, but he has to walk, he has to walk out of this world of darkness.</p>
<p>He knows that darkness will eventually end, and the future has unlimited light. Courageously, he will definitely walk out of this world of darkness.</p>
<p>He is familiar with: everything in this darkness. The night owl in the forest is a harsh poet, he cries out the most sorrowful moans of mankind; the firefly by the pond is the most hopeful beacon, it strengthens the night walker's resolute will; the yellow dog in the village is the most snobbish villain, he portrays the powerful people who are in power in this world; the fleeting shooting star in the sky is the epitome of life, it awakens those who are wallowing in their dreams; and the shocking storm in the darkness is the most terrifying original form of this world.</p>
<p>But he still walks, using the footsteps of his own reason, towards the darkness. Oh, night walker, be even more courageous! Let us gather now, holding hands in the dawn's light, and let us each walk alone into the darkness.</p>
<h3>Crossing the River</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhengke</p>
<h3>I Miss Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Lately, I often miss Shanghai. It has been eight years since I was taken from Rue Luber to the North Railway Station in a Yunfei car. After passing through layers of difficulties and batches of inspections, I boarded a crowded train under the gun butts and iron rods of Japanese soldiers. Then, the towering foreign buildings, the smooth asphalt roads, the tram tracks winding like snakes... all disappeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>I remember that when I was in Shanghai, I deeply hated Shanghai. I hated that pigeon-cage-like room, which couldn't see the sun or feel the cool breeze. All year round, there were only countless bedbugs breeding without limit, sucking people's marrow and blood.</p>
<p>But I also deeply loved Shanghai. I loved the quiet Avenue Joffre. I loved the fountain in the French Park, and the purple little flowers next to the fountain. I liked standing alone under the street lamps at dusk, watching the many Shanghai ladies dressed in gorgeous and alluring clothes. I didn't envy them, nor did I curse them, just silently watched them.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I paid attention to the tycoons sitting in black-licensed cars, with their big bellies, gold chains, and diamond rings. I also paid attention to the paupers shrinking in the small alleys, who were as skinny as firewood and covered in sores. Then I remembered the story of the rich man and Lazarus in the Bible. I didn't congratulate the tycoons, nor did I sigh for the paupers. I knew that in a blink of an eye, the world would turn upside down, Shanghai would turn upside down, and both the tycoons and the paupers would turn upside down.</p>
<p>Shanghai, like a small ladder, had once carried me to the entrance of heaven; it was also like a terrible ghost car that pushed me to the edge of hell. However, I had neither the fortune to enter the hall nor the courage to descend into hell. I could only quietly leave with a tired body.</p>
<p>I left on November 26, 1938. It was raining. I thought to myself: Maybe I won't come to this place again in the future.</p>
<p>But I myself don't understand, lately, I suddenly often miss Shanghai, it seems there is a bit of attachment, a bit of melancholy, and a bit of indescribable contradictory emotions.</p>

<h3>Flying Together (61)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Xiao Hong! Xiao Hong! What's wrong?" Bao Ling shouted in a panic, while hurriedly helping her up.</p>
<p>Oh my god! The flesh that had already been frozen and starved could not suddenly come into contact with hot things. Now, Xiao Hong's two feet, all ten toes, were like they had been cut by a knife, dislocated from the joints, and falling off! A basin of water immediately turned into a basin of blood!</p>
<p>Bao Ling initially thought that Xiao Hong fainted because she was too angry, but when she saw that her two feet had become like this, she was simply flustered. She wanted to carry her out, but was afraid that the landlady would say even more gossip. She herself couldn't leave and had no way out, so she had to shout:</p>
<p>"Liao Landlady! Liao Landlady!"</p>
<p>After shouting for a while without any response, Bao Ling strained her voice and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Help! Help!"</p>
<p>With that, Liao Landlord came, the old landlady came, and Liao Dong also came. Xiao Hong had already woken up!</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Liao Landlord asked Bao Ling in surprise when he saw the scene.</p>
<p>"Xiao Hong's feet were frostbitten. She thought she could wash them with hot water to warm them up a bit, but who knew that as soon as she put them in the basin, they became like this." Bao Ling said, giving the landlady a fierce look.</p>
<p>"Strange, she was fine just now! I'm afraid the water was too hot and burned her, right?" The landlady said, pretending to be concerned, wanting to push the responsibility onto Bao Ling.</p>
<p>"Who has ever seen frostbite like this? Frozen flesh and blood cannot be roasted with fire or scalded with water!" Liao Landlord scratched his head anxiously.</p>
<p>"She in the afternoon--" Bao Ling hadn't finished speaking.</p>
<p>"She didn't do anything in the afternoon!" The landlady hurriedly interrupted Bao Ling's words, feigning surprise and saying, "It's really strange, how could she get frostbite like this? Although the weather is cold, it's always better indoors than outdoors!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Only outdoors can you get frostbite like this." Bao Ling deliberately repeated a sentence.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong heard all their words. She also didn't want to tell the truth, to make Liao Landlord and the landlady angry. It was even more inconvenient for her to defend Bao Ling. It wasn't his fault. She moaned in pain, her face becoming even paler, her heart so weak that it almost stopped beating.</p>
<p>"Quickly carry her to the bed in the room and let her lie down!" Liao Landlord said to the landlady. At the same time, he instructed Liao Dong: "Dong'er, go ask Master Li to weigh two taels of rice and cook some soup for her to drink. And bring a bottle of 'Yunnan Baiyao' to apply to her first."</p>
