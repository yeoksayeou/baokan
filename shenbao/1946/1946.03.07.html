<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播稱：英外相貝文，今日布下院宣稱：「關於滿洲日工廠與機器處置問題，英政府認爲日本產業之處置，應由可獲得日方賠償各國政府決定之。在未獲得此稱決定之前，所有日本產業與物資，應由產業所在地之政府暫行保管」。旋由議員戴維斯詢諸貝文曰：「除中國政府以外，其他政府是否有權可自中國領土搬走物資」，貝文答云：「宇宙之大，並無條約規定以此種權利授予中國以外之任何國家」。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦四日電〕英下院今晚集會，議員提出關於中國東北之雅爾達協定秘密條款之詢問，當時空氣頗呈激昻，自由憲政黨領袖戴維斯提出詢問稱，自英國政府視之，本身是否受此雅爾達協定之約束。國務大臣貝克答稱：然，受其約束。戴維斯繼復詢問稱：中國東北境內工業機械之被遷移，係根據何一協定，貝氏隨與艾德禮首相商談，然未即時提出答覆，渠稱：此項詢問，如以書面提出，日後可能獲覆。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播訊：中國外交部次長劉鍇今日稱：中國正「不斷」催促蘇軍自東北撤退，並已將中國之立塲向莫斯科闡明。劉氏證實蘇方曾將工業機械自東北搬走之消息，但對中央政府是否已就此事向蘇聯提出抗議一節，旣不承認亦不否認。渠謂：王外長已闡明中國之立場，即所有日本及傀儡之財產，必須視爲付給中國賠償之一部，此項觀點與蘇聯所主此項財產應作爲蘇方戰利品之立塲，不相一致。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕外記者招待會，六日午後三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，劉次長鍇主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>問，美政府曾要求中國，就東北交涉情况隨時通知美方，中國政府是否業已答覆？</p>
<p>答，中國政府業向美政府答覆覆</p>
<p>問，自二月一日以來，中國政府曾吾接到蘇方有關蘇軍撤退之文件？</p>
<p>答，蘇方當局曾通知我國，蘇軍撤退之延遲，係由於技術上之困難，惟未說明係何種技術困難。</p>
<p>問，旅順，大連之接收情形如何？</p>
<p>答，旅順大連問題，與東北之整個接收相互關聯。</p>

<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓五日電〕國務院本日發表聲明如次：國務卿貝爾納斯，於一九四六年二月九日，訓令美國駐重慶與莫斯科大使館，向中國及蘇聯政府提出照會，闡明美國見解，內容如下：最近報稱，中蘇二國政府官員，曾爲處置及接管滿洲之工業，進行會商，美國政府對此備極關切。一九四五年八月十四日所簽訂之中蘇條約，曾有中蘇共管滿洲區域內某某鐵路幹綫之規定，然是項協定並未包括指明滿洲之工業亦將置於共管之下，美國政府對上稱談判之經過，以迄一九四五年八月雙方接受此項協議止，經常獲取報告，美國政府認爲，中蘇兩國政府共管滿洲之企業，應以上述協議有關之鐵路爲限。職是之故，美國政府接獲報告，以雙方刻正進行談判。其結果或將實現中蘇北管滿洲之工業，木政府對此項報告深引以爲慮。</p>
<p>美將提議分配　日在國外產業</p>
<p>處於目前情况之下，當此其他國籍人民未獲進人滿洲境內自由，且美國與其他盟國人民未能獲取均等機會，俾彼輩能參加滿洲之經濟開發事業之時，木政府感覺中。蘇政府舉行此種有關滿洲工業之談判，實與門戶開放政策背道而馳，此將令有愆參加開發滿洲工業之美國人士，遭受明顯之歧視，並將令與滿洲成立貿易關係之美商，居於顯著不利地位。與滿洲工業問題直接有關者，乃對日之賠償政策問題，蓋日本潰收之前，滿洲之工業，大部係操於日人之手。本政府認爲，對日本國外資產之最後處置，如滿洲工業即爲一例，乃凡肩負擊敗日木主要重任之盟國，共同發生興趣與關注之問題。本政府今正準備一有關日本賠償事宜之廣泛政策綱要，即將提交有關政府考慮，此次政策將建議設置一盟國向日索取賠償委員會，此一委員會將在各提出要求國家之間，對日木之國外產業作最後之分配。是以若於此時對日本在滿洲資產作最後之處置實有未妥，此或自滿洲搬運視同「戰利品」之工業資產，或中蘇政府成立管制上述資產所有權，均屬如此。</p>
<p>美國政府願與中蘇二國政府合作，共覓解次上舉各項問題之道，並盼其他兩國政府能出以同樣之合作精神，是以美國政府如蒙以中蘇談判經過，或彼等即將採取有關處置或管制滿洲工業行動之情形見告，將不勝感激。吾人將歡迎彼此坦率及充分討論一般問題。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯宣布　我外交部覆文</p>
<p>國務卿貝爾納斯本日宣布，渠曾接獲中國外交部之覆文，大旨如下：蘇聯政府在其一九四六年一月廿一日提交中國政府之備忘錄中宣稱：所有日本在中國東北省份，曾爲日本軍隊效力之企業，蘇聯均認爲係蘇軍之戰利品。中國政府認爲，蘇聯政府此項要求，遠踰國際公法或國際慣例所承認戰利品之範圍，職是之故，兩國政府對有關之基本原則，見解未能趨於一致。在另一提交蔣委員長長春行營之備忘錄中，蘇聯政府宣稱：擬以蘇聯所認爲戰利品之日本工業一部移交中國，然其餘企業，包括指定之煤礦·發電廠·鋼鐵廠·化學工業及水門　工業，則應歸中蘇二國共營。中國政府方面感覺，米能對蘇聯此項建議表示同意，因其逾越一九四五年八月十四日中蘇條的之規定，並與中國政府對於日本在華產業與企業所採立塲互相砥觸。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕張治中周恩來及馬歇爾等一行，六日午十二時半，自漢口飛返抵渝。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本埠六日訊〕今日據接近美駐華特使馬歇爾將軍方面聲稱：整個東北包括於北平之軍事調處執行部範圍以內，預料內有美方代表之「停止衝突」陳地觀察小組，不日即須被派前往蘇方擯斥美國觀察者之地區。據指謂一月十日在渝簽訂之「停止衝突」協定，確實包括東北在內。據稱：所謂東北不在軍調處部管轄下之不幸影象，係發生於該部方行組成時之記者招待會中。該次招待會內，軍調處部三委員曾聲言東北不在管轄範圍之內云云，另一起因，即由於陣地視察小組迄未進入東北一事實之故。該接近馬特使方面繼謂：最近完成之國共兩軍整編暨統一計劃，亦將東北確切包括在內。該項計劃規定立即開始軍隊之整編，故在短時期內派遣陣地視察小組前往柬北，已被視爲迫切之舉。（按最近前往東北之訪員報告謂，蘇聯對東北之中國共產黨正予以武裝，「以爲政治及宣傳上之利用。」此種報告內，曾提及實施上述計劃時有趨於複雜之可能性云。）中央政府方而，據稱不願使視察小組進入柬北，蓋深恐此項行動，可能引起蘇方之仇意，中國對蘇之關係，已屬緊張云。共黨方面，據悉同意視家小組之進入東北，因據稱中央政府欲避免足以觸犯東北「托管人」蘇聯之任何行動，故有人提議蘇方可至少被邀與視察小組，在東北就地舉行會談，作爲一種禮遇之表示，然此舉之可能性，未得任何官方之證實。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本埠訊〕蘇聯駐軍擬於何時撤離東九省，恐僅克林姆宮知之，但蘇軍如果撤退，則東九省已不復爲富庶工業地區。蓋各種機器，不論輕重大小，自火車頭至旋鑿。皆被蘇軍當作戰利品車載而去，然蘇聯對日作戰不過一星期有零耳。東九省仍有廣大肥沃土地，但現已不復具有工業潛勢，某有資格華人告聯合社記者稱：搬運一舉，似有兩種用意，第一，蘇聯得藉此在東部建立其一己軍事工業，第二，一旦東九省又成戰場，則不復有工廠可供對方利用。在瀋陽區大小工廠五千家，幾已完全搬空，並加重創。據蒞臨此蘇聯軍事重地之美國記者觀察：縱使蘇聯於取得某種經濟權益後，退出東九省其他部分，仍準備以任何代價留駐大連。外國記者在東九省共逗留二星期，其已回滬者，以記者爲第一人，記者等在東北大多時間有蘇聯機關槍手作伴。就各方面所得印象，深信蘇聯已在若干地區深溝高壘，非有較中國更大之壓力，不能將其驅出。瀋陽中國高級將官稱：東方蘇軍總司令馬林諾夫斯基於紅軍日在長春所發表演說，已反映蘇聯具有留駐次心。該參謀又告記者，謂此項言辭已「獲證實」，但在長春被留禁多日之美國記者，尚無所發表。在瀋陽及其他城市，雖中蘇國旗並懸，中國人實毫無權力，無異在莫斯科。又，東九省白俄皆被蘇聯利用，但一般均遭受惡劣待遇。總之蘇聯已在亞洲獲得一新立足點，以紅軍武力爲後盾，此秘密警察，間諜及威嚇乎段確保安全，蘇聯在表面上假示中蘇友誼，如紅軍日瀋陽市上標語所揭　者，實則對中國人僅藐視之而已。其對待中國人無殊被征服人民，心胆俱裂之華人，僅在華軍司令部內敢告訴記者，謂蘇軍在華人　內姦淫虜掠，無所不至，中國人對於蘇軍則公然表示恐懼，即在白日亦不敢在瀋陽街上行走，恐遇阻於紅軍士兵，失去其錶或錢鈔。在瀋陽城內僅少數中國士兵守護司令部。蓋彭　生將軍部下大軍仍駐守城外，以防與武器不離身之蘇軍發生衝突，蘇軍不准中國平民携帶武器，違者立刻處死，惟市長及其秘書爲例外。有蘇聯司令官特別護照，准帶武器。瀋陽商店恐遭蘇軍刦掠，均用板條釘起，櫥窗中僅陣列三等貨物，遇美國人購物，始肯出示上等貨物，平時均藏匿，俾不爲蘇軍所見。瀋陽城內德國人，未因蘇軍佔領受何影響，據華人稱：蘇軍開入後，德國俱樂部上，猶　掦納粹國旗，達二星期之久。瀋陽城中中國人遇見美國人，雖僅爲記者，亦欣喜逾恒，見有CBI肩章，即開顏詢問：「君非美國士兵乎？」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京六日電〕日皇裕仁本日晚間分布詔書，完全接受新憲法草案。眧曰：「朕欲將帝國之憲法，依照人民之意志及尊重基本權利之原則，予以根本的修改，爰乃授命政府主管當局，盡其全力，以促其成」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕日本政府決定採納新憲法草案，乃經過長時間艱困　論之結果。內閣於昨日午前十時開會，直至夜間十一時始息。昨夜首相　原偕憲草專家松本入宮觀見日皇，商議約三小時之久。外相吉田則訪問麥帥總部。本日內　　續開會，直至午後四時未歇。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京六日電〕麥帥總部今日突然宣布日本新憲法。新憲法規定永遠廢止戰爭並不得編練武裝軍隊，主要屬於人民全體，日　無統治權，其地位降爲國家象徵，僅主持國家大典。此項新憲法共九十五章，列舉日本人民享有革命性之各種權利。衆議院權力擴大爲眞正立法機關，　選終身職貴族院改爲民選參議院。新憲法第九條載稱：「以戰爭爲國家主權所在及武力之威脅或利用，須永遠放棄。不得作爲與其他國家解決紛爭之工具，陸海空軍及其他潛在的軍事組織均不得設立，政府不得有宣戰權」。</p>

<p>新憲法並載稱，日本如欲在國際間佔一光榮地位，必須使日本憲法對內足以奠定民主政府之鞏固基礎，對外則領導世界其餘各國廢除戰爭。新憲法中雖規定日本首相將由議會產生，但現任官員仍可蟬聯。日本內閣昨今兩日會議已達最後階段，預料將於日內發表另一重要決議，擴大肅淸贖武份子範圍，政府或將因此改組。新憲法依據美國憲法賦予人民谷項新的，革命性的自由，其中包括：夫婦平權，婚姻須經男女雙方同意，廢除任何奴役，除作爲犯罪者之刑罰外，禁止强迫奴役他人，人民有思想及信仰自由，他人不得侵害，此在有「思想警察」之國家頗堪注意。絕對禁止官員以嚴刑拷問及施用其他殘酷刑罰，日本警察不得任意搜查並拘捕人民，各項案件應迅速審判，不得延擱，並須依據法律手續辦理，人民有言論宗敎自由，政府及其所屬機關，不得施行宗敎敎育或從事任何宗敎活動。</p>
<p>新憲法序言中稱，日本民衆願與世界各國安然共同合作，希望在國內享受各種自由，並決定再使政府行動引起戰爭慘禍。茲特宣布，政府措施應以民衆意旨爲依蹄。</p>
<p>新憲法內，並規定建立攝政制度，實爲日本憲法中從所未有者。日皇室接受給與財產及其支出費用須經議會通過，人民應盡同等義務，享同等權利，不應有所差別。</p>
<p>日本新憲法，係日本政府與麥帥總部於過去五個月間屢次會議後草成。據麥帥今夜宣稱，新憲法爲一開明之文獻，其內容「予完全贊同」。依照新憲法，日皇已不再掌握日本政權，彼將服從民衆意旨，僅爲整個日本民衆之象徵而已。</p>

<h3 id="c44">社論　解救當前的經濟危機 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>中國國民黨二中全會四次及五次大會席上，各委員對我國當前的外交及財政經濟等問題，頗多慷慨發言，情緒激昻；無論二中全會對是項問題將有如何次議，以及將來政府準備採取何種措施，此種熱烈的塲面，實爲國民黨再生的象徵。全國人民所熱烈期待着的抗戰勝利蒞臨以來，在過去六個月中，內憂外患，紛至沓來。勝利雖然在握，而國難却未稍紓。特別是收復區的人民，這幾個月來，物價的不斷騰漲，帶給他們以高度的生活不安。目今橫置在我們前面的問題，一爲外交的未能施展，一爲嚴重的經濟危機。中國國民黨領導我們全民作長期的抗戰而獲致勝利，亦負有解除當前國難的重責。此次二中全會席上，或則要求改變外交作風，或則對政府財政金融經濟各種措施，爲嚴格的檢討，不特足以提高我們對此項問題的警覺性，抑亦執行着國民黨監督政府的任務，同時亦說出了人民胸中的　結。</p>
<p>我們姑且在此地不談外交國際問題，但我們却要指出當前經濟危機的嚴重。這經濟危機不因抗戰勝利而减輕，其嚴重性却與日以俱增。如果政府再不拿出辦法來嚴厲執行，中國的民族經濟即將全部崩潰；在事實上，中國的民族經濟已瀕於崩潰。中產階級這幾年來的破產與沒落，已使將來中國的經濟復典感到絕大的困難。今天，在日本投降了已逾半年的今天，我們試想一想我們當前的民族經濟呈現着何等危險的病象。大後方的生產事業停頓了，收復區的生產事業亦復滯留在停頓的階段。收復區內新興官僚資本的風起，不特與民學利，違反了民生主義的精神，抑且破壞政府的政策，或則擅自提高本身的待遇，破壞了政府整個的體制，或則率先提高物價，促使一般物價的上騰；至於敵僞產業的處理，尤其是一篇混帳，誰也莫明其底細。收復區六個月來，一般物價漲了六倍以上；弄得人民對生活不堪負荷，工潮此起彼伏，迄無寗日。長此以往，政府人民，交感其困，豈是國家民族之福？</p>
<p>爲什麼當前的經濟危機會日趨嚴重？主要是政府沒有處理當前經濟危難的基本政策，有了政策而又不能統一執行。這充分顯出了政府的無能。無能的政府不但未能解除目前困難，却且使困難日益加重。蔣主席巡行一地，即注意當地的物價，要使之平抑；我主席對物價的關注，實至殷切；但何以各地的物價幾個月來不但未能收平抑之實效，却反而日趨高漲，六個月來，至少漲上六倍。這就是表現了政府，特別是主管財政金融經濟的各部門的無能。就財政方面言，什麼又是我們的財政國策？在戰時，藉發行來彌補收入，原有不得已的苦衷；但何以戰事已經停止了逾六個月，而法幣的價値亦同樣降低了六七倍。照理，有廣大的收復區可以容納已經膨漲了的通貨，因發行地區的推廣，原可達到部分通貨收縮的目的；但何以我們的幣値却一直在下跌？我們要問財政當局對我們的通貨究竟取什麼政策，如何防制它的再下跌；我們不但要問財政當局對這通貨問題要採何種措施，我們而且更要問財政當局對整理幣制倒底有無切實辦法。中國人民及政府，不能因財政當局的無能，而長此爲惡性通貨膨脹所苦惱。這病症須要立刻診治，不容延緩。「救救法幣，」這是何等迫切的呼號。「主管當局有辦法說出來，無辦法想出來，有辦法挑起來，無辦法放下來」纔是正當的步驟；我們不能讓無能來戕害我們的生命。</p>
<p>對於財政方面，還有一個相當嚴重而未爲世人所注意的問題，就是各地鹽價的增高，到處閙着鹽荒，而產地的鹽產却不能外銷，以致鹽民率多放棄製鹽，轉就別業。「鹽政」這一類的名稱猶在我國出現，而我國還有這許多「鹽官」來辦理「鹽政」，實是我們的恥辱。試問在英，在美，在其它文明國家有無像我們這種「鹽官」，這種「　官」一面破壞了我們傳統的行鹽制度，一而從中覇持郤不許人民自由買賣，以致各地鹽價高漲，到處鹽荒。試問這種施政是否能爲民生主義所容許？「熙政」的主管爲財政當局，何以不加聞問？</p>
<p>講到經濟方面，情形的嚴重，自又不待多言。工廠的停頓，工人的失業，官僚資本的培植，民營企業的橫遭阻撓，敵僞產業處理局迄未將全貌公布，諸如此類，都使人民杌隉不安。我們不能讓這種局面長此遷延下去，中國國民黨是目今執政的政黨，對於如何解除目前的經濟危機，負有重責。我們希望這次二中全會的召開，對於解除目前的經濟危機，能够拿出辦法來。民族前途，胥利賴之。</p>

<p>變態心理四字何能洗滌其罪</p>
<p>美軍法庭昨日三審石原勇，石原勇爲表明其所作所爲，均爲克盡職責起見，特於去年就捕以前，將其小指切去。昨開庭時，該犯在法庭上，被雙方律師質問，在江灣與吳淞中營虐待美戰俘之情形。石原勇在庭上滔滔不絕，以似通不通之英語，大發宏論彼首稱，彼生平看不起懦夫，認爲在集中營內者，均是無能之輩。彼等旣不能到前綫作戰，自應在後方作苦工。又自承曾對各戰犯行灌水刑，但又解釋灌水刑並不能致人於死，因彼自身亦曾受灌水刑九次。彼又自稱，曾爲營中各人謀福利，一九四五年辭職，原因爲不滿集中營內各種措施。十時半，雙方辯論律師開庭辯論先由被告辯論律師利威雲少校，及多納中尉，指出被告石原勇之犯罪原因，請審判官注意：（一）各證人自美方來信，多加　染，似有過甚其詞，使石原勇之罪加重。（三）石原勇爲衆矢之的彼已深承其罪。（三）希望庭上查明茲犯犯罪時之處境。又由利威雲少校解釋，石原勇犯罪乃屬變態心理，因該犯自東京到中國時，自負甚高，後來在集中營內得小職位，與士兵同等待遇，內心非常痛苦，故將其不平之氣，發洩於戰俘身上。每次打人，即引以自榮故其打人　　待戰犯並非出於自願。原吿辯論律師加蘭　氏，反駁利威雲少校之意見，以爲石原勇之爲人，有近殘暴，並非「變態心理」四字可以洗滌其罪。雙方辯論完畢，主審官定今（七日）下午三時宣判。</p>

<p>自中央銀行於本週一實行開放外匯，自由賣買後，各方咸極注目，事實上外匯掛牌掛在何處，外匯在何處自由賣買，一般商人仍感糢糊，進口商結進美匯，除照中行所囑託之價格外，尙須負擔掮客佣金，承做外匯之銀行尙有附加，出口商結售外匯，各行買價不一，大致較美鈔市價略低，幷須再打一九七折扣，因此賣買價格拔開到一百餘元，照以前黑市匯票，普通成交，電匯總照美鈔爲高，大的現鈔値電匯九七折，出口商所得電匯，照美鈔市價有昇水，可以賣得出，開放自由賣買後，進口商與出口商除遭受當局種種申請上之限制外，幷且雙方同時擔負中間人轉手的權種經手費，幷且所謂掛牌，除了美匯外，其他外匯概照市價，由承做各行自行推算，那末所謂鄭重其事的外匯掛牌，充其量亦不過與錢兌業不相上下而已，近來小錢莊美鈔賣買相差不到三十元，大銀行的美匯進出價倒拔開一百餘元，幷且其他外匯，照市價推算，而不照公價折合，則較經營黑市的小錢莊亦不見有何改進，昨日實行期貨賣買，價格按月增加一百元，與以前遠期外匯相反，投機的心理，又有些敏感了，我們希望外匯公開賣買，要有一個完整的外匯掛牌，幅度及差價要盡量使之狹小，美匯以外的外匯，應有一個合理的推算，務使投機家無隙可乘，未雨綢繆，此其時矣。</p>

<h3 id="c95">戶外運動塲　　美國正普遍提倡　　都市中的戶外運動塲，已隨大衆之重視體有而日益普遍。十九世紀時代，僅有少數由學校及社會團體所舉辦之兒童遊戲塲，但自第一次世界大戰後，街頭之汽車來往，益形頻繁，爲使兒童於課後能在新空氣中遊戲而無危險起見，此種戶外運動塲之需要，已愈感迫切。美國提倡允力。左岡即美國大西洋岸紐的城兒童，在市政府辦理之戶外運動塲上練習排球：屹立在西康高原的最高學府　國立西康技藝專科學校（上）  金　　七年前，正是徐州武漢廣州相繼陷敵，悲觀論者短視地懷疑着持久戰策略的時候，西康省的成立，像一道强烈的光芒，射照在全中國的每一個角落，也照醒了短視者的迷夢，照出了漢奸的臉嘴。大批的工程師，各種的專門學家，擁入了西康，「開發西康」的口號，流行在內地人們的嘴角上，出現在大後方每張報紙每本雜誌七。　　李博士創建　　廿七年秋間，李書田博士——一位水利工程家，北洋工學院的主持者，領了一批人員，到達了西康富藏中心的西昌。那裏有着無窮的鐵銅鋅煤，而原始式的森林牧場，更在在的等待着人們的開發利用。當李博士考察調查完竣後，立刻寫了一個報吿書，除了報吿她的富庶外，還建議設立一所專門學校，包括農工方面，來負責培養開發富源的幹部。因爲抗戰，是一件長期而又帶有建設性的偉業，而一切資源的開發，更是長期抗戰唯一的資本，設立一所專門學校來負此重任，常然是必需的了。　　經過多次的奔洽，數度的籌劃，在李博士的努力下，「國六西康技藝專科學校」的新招牌，便雄立在邊遠而又被人目爲蠻夷之區的西昌了。　　新型的學府　　原先的計劃，是辦一個大學。然而格於當時的環境，配合抗戰的急需，採用全國首創的三年和五年的二種專科制，前者，招收高中畢業生，像一般大學，加以三年專門學識的訓練，後者，招收初中程度的畢業生，加以五年的專門訓練，前二年是把一般高中的課程授完，後三年和三年制一樣，是專門課程。這樣一來，可以補救一般四年制的學識時間不足的短處，同樣也避免了大學四年中不必需要的課目，而且减少修學的期限，造就大量的幹部人才。這種新型的學府，在全國只有三所，除「西康技專」外，在西北有一所「西北技專」，只辦五年制的農科，在四川的樂山，有一所「中央技專」，亦是輕工業方面的科系，係造紙製革等。　　重工業科系　　而「西康技專」，是三所中的幸運兒，在李博士的魄力下，設立了重工業的科系。礦冶·機械·化工，土木四系外，還設了農林和畜牧二系。他拿出了在北洋工學院的魄力，創辦了「西康技專」，雖然有人說是「殺鷄用牛刀」，和「大材小用」，然而爲了民族，爲了國家，爲了敎育，他不計毀響的幹着。廿八年秋天，在重慶成都昆明，招取大批邊疆的靑年，在西昌名勝區的瀘山，開始了第一課。　　當時所設的科系，上面已經提過，其中礦冶一系，只收高中生，而機械和化工二系，却只收初中生。其他三系，則高初中都收。那時敎授職員，甚至連圖書館的管理員，亦是從北洋工學院來的。而農科的敎授，亦是全國有名的學者，那時的「西康技專」可稱是黃金時代。　　工廠和農塲，亦同時成立了起來。圖書，除一部份新購外，大部是北洋工學院的遺物。而儀器部份，亦由李博士一手籌借。就土木系說，有四架經緯儀，三架水平議，其中一半是蔡司牌。化學和礦冶的標本，亦從各方面捐募了很多。 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<p>自由談修養精神上的吝嗇  溯因　　吝嗇是慷概的反面，是爲人所詬病的。但一般人的見解，以爲吝嗇是奪指物質而言的；其實吝嗇還有屬於精神方面的，而作精神上的吝嗇的，恐怕比作物質上的吝嗇的還多。　　譬如一個人對於他所懂的智識，所具有的技能，若不是有條件，不肯隨便指敎，傳授人家；得到了可喜的消息，不肯吿訴人家；聽見別人講述得意的事，不願表示欣喜，遇到人家遺逢不幸時，不肯表示同情；以及平常時日，隨便碰到甚麼人，不肯露一點笑容，談幾句使人愉快的話，或稱許人家幾句，這種種便都是精神上的吝嗇。　　除了智識技能上的吝嗇外，其餘都屬於情感上的吝嗇，這就是所謂「冷酷」，「寡情」，「淡漢」之類。一個人作情感上的慷慨有時是比作物質上，或體力上的慷慨爲難能。有不少的人，他們寗願給你金錢，物質，甚至組你服役，却不肯假你以『詞色」，他們也許自命爲「傲骨天生」，其實這是自私自利，跟物質上的吝嗇殊途同歸。　　我們過分浪費情感或用不得其當，固然也有流弊，但適度的和恰如分際的運用情感是必要的，是利人亦利己的，因爲人類是感情的動物，所以你若要在人類的社會中做一個成功的人，你必得善用情感，慷慨施用情感。生理獨眼無憂  鍾佐　　在工業上的意外事件中及戰爭時的損害中，許多人不幸地喪失了一隻眼睛，這些獨眼者因有種種的疑懼，常常變得消極悲觀。　　獨眼者往往以爲自己的視界僅及常人的一半，其實兩者之間，相差甚微，比較起來，並不重要。獨眼者對於短距離（一二尺內）的判斷力，的確較常人爲低，譬如他們有時會將咖啡倒在杯子的托碟上，或者在穿針錢時感覺困難，而對於需要精密測量的機械工作，時常做得很拙劣。但是這些情形，經過稍微的當心和忍耐，就都會消失了。　　一般獨　者時常担心，唯恐一隻眼睛做了二隻肌睛的工作，一定很容易損壞。這是不對的。在眼睛初壞時，也許會感覺眼睛疲乏或頭痛，這不過是暫時的，獨眼者如果在開始的幾星期中常投間時使眼睛休息，照樣能做需要視力集中的事情，且能做得很好，而沒有任何危險。　　獨眼者時常怨恨，說他們的外貌完全毀壞了，但現今進步的外科手術已克復了這種困難，新式的膠製人工眼睛簡直與眞的完全一樣。　　英國的海軍名將納爾遜是一個獨眼者；現任英國駐印總督魏菲爾勛爵也是一個獨眼者；一個獨眼的美國飛行員竟能週飛世界而打破紀錄；美國著名外科醫生偉勒，在他行醫的中期失去了一隻眼睛，他照常訓練自己替病人行手術。　　獨眼者不必憂愁！心理上的長期疑懼反會毀了你的一生。國際種族的自尊和歧視  楊謀　　德國人，日本人，對於他們自己的種族，都抱着一種高度的優越感。這次大戰的釁起，也可以說，一大半的原因是爲了這種心理的作祟，而有了稱霸世界的狂妄的野心。但是，在另一方面，英美人對於他們的白色民族，又何嘗沒有自大性呢？他們對於有色人稱的歧視，我想，不用我贅述，一定是每個人都明白的。　　這種對於自己民族尊視對於他民族的歧視的心理，也許是人類共通的天性。這種天性，促使人類文明日新月異，也是這種天性，引起人和人間瘋狂的像野獸般的大屠殺。但是，這種天性，在中國，却很有例外。　　華僑的在海外的，他們受所在地政府的歧視，實在書不盡　。就拿最近來說，暹邏還發生大屠殺華僑的舉動，只因近世紀的中國，一向就是沒有外交的弱國，所以華僑們也只能甘受人家的歧視，不存一絲一毫反抗的意念，而含　忍辱的生活下去。　　在國內來說，因爲歷年來不平等條約約束縛，使一般人的心裘，都存了對「洋人」尊視的心理。雖然現在領事裁判權收同了，不平等條約取消了，這種心理上留下的暗影，却始終沒有剷除。從小的方面來說，有很多機關，更有許多是我們國家的機關，對於中外人員的待遇發生高額的差別，同樣工作的人員，而付給「洋人」的待遇遠過於「華人」，這理由眞是百思莫解。從大的方面講，「洋人」的領事裁判權雖然取消了，他們却似乎還享有著道種特權。我親自目睹有好幾次，警察對於「洋人」的違法行爲，採取不聞不問的態度。　　從雅片戰爭到現在，中國不知經滕了多少的患難，更不知受了多少的損失，現在，總算躋身於强國之列，我們痛自檢討過去，覺得我們的損失，莫過於這對於自己民族尊視心理的喪失再可痛的了。　　有一次有一個人因爲違反交通規則，要給警察帶到警察局中去，但另一個同樣犯規的「洋人」，却仍從容的過去，那個人責問警察，警察却回答他：「你爲什麼不投胎外國人？」說者無心，聽者是多麼的痛心。　　我們不希望歧視外族，我們也不願意妄自誇大，但是，對於自己民族的尊嚴，我們必須保持，我們不該歧視外民族，我們也不該受外民族的歧視。　　撫慰百年來我們民族所受的創傷，不禁令我們起無限的感慨。站立在新的基礎上，作新的奮鬥，已經是時機了。每一個人，應該尊重自己，尊重我們自己的民族。人物邱吉爾夫人  安東　　在英國，提起邱吉爾夫人，誰都會說：『邱吉爾夫人？哦，她可眞了不起』！似使你再追問一句：『何以見得呢』？他們會給你解釋：「這個，你知道，她只是了不起』。再加思索，試找出另外一個形容詞，可以說她非常有魄力。　　邱吉爾夫人是一個漂亮的女人。她的外表頗有助於使英國人對於她和她的丈夫發生好感。因爲英國人對於漂亮女人多有一種羅曼蒂克的傾向。他們喜歡說：「這是我們的老邱，你看她的太太豈不漂亮』。年老的人記起　汽汕燈時代的倫敦。他們時常看見霍齊爾小姐（Clementine　Hozier，邱吉爾太太的姑娘名字）和她的母親形影不離。邱吉爾夫人到今日依然是一個允物。　　她也够矯健，玩得一手好網球。她是一個出色的各季運動家。一般認爲滑雪得從育兒室內學　的專家，莫不驚訝於邱吉爾夫人的老而彌健。她滑雪時所表現的次心，一如其表現於任何事物者。戰前不久一個冬天，她竟然宣佈要參加著名的正式滑雪競賽。當時比較年靑和經騐豐富的介員，都大爲震驚。因爲時値風雪，她們担心她至少得折斷四五根骨頭。事出乎意外，她到達終點，依然精神飽滿，毫無損傷。　　她玩得出色和起勁的另外一種運動是木槌球，這並非如常人想像的英國園遊會裏面的文雅遊戲。名戲劇家諾爾考華便是她的好對手之一。她喜歡上戲院，亦樂與劇人交遊。　　像她家裏的人一樣，她喜歡法國電影，老的樂院歌曲（邱吉爾收藏極豐），和美國雜誌。　　知邱吉爾夫人者說，她是一個極前進的自由黨員，雖則邱吉爾傾向於保守黨。三十五年來，他們相敬如賓。在邱吉爾作週末休息時，他們總是靜靜地玩着紙牌。　　一個倫敦裁縫到唐寗街十號去爲邱吉爾夫人試新衣。邱吉爾克穿着睡衣，口含雪茄，踱入室來，柔和地觀看。那裁縫記得：「太太吿訴他當日要去的地方，並且吩咐他不要回來太晚。先生唯唯：「是眞親愛的」。一如普通的男人」。　　即使邱吉爾是一個普通的男人，則邱吉爾夫人對他事業的關切程度，也不會有甚麼兩樣。發明最新發明的衣料  左右　　數千年來，紡織布匹的方法，都是一成不變的：便是棉花被紡成紗，紗再被織成布，這方法到了最近，因化學工業的進步，却起了空前的大革新。　　（一）五彩綾羅母須織　　第一種製布的新方法便是這樣的：　　棉花纖維先被梳理而成一片狀如毛　的絮胎，然後被放入滾筒之問緊壓，成爲蒲薄的一層。接着再用一種特製的漿水，塗在上面，使每一根綿花纖維都緊緊粘在一起，不復移動。這種漿水，旣爲潔白無色，又可調合各種絢麗色彩，印在布上，畫出各種的花樣。　　等到彩色的漿水，在溫熟的圓筒上被烘乾，布匹便製造成功了。在頃刻之間，棉花原料已變成五彩的綾羅，至於老式的紡織機，却還需要十多種繁複的手續呢。　　這種新式布匹比老式布匹價格低廉，一則因爲製造簡單迅速，二則　爲同樣製造一段布匹，新法所用原料比較節省。譬如一磅棉花在老式的紡織機上，祗能織成八碼長的薄紗，但如用新法製造，則可出產二十四碼長的毛巾了。幷且那新式的布匹又極緊密，至於紡織機上最細的細布，却還是孔隙累累。　　（二）蟬翼輕綃衣無縫　　第二種製布的方法更奇妙。　　用一種狀如纖維的漿汁，與棉花纖維混和在一起，再用高熱的潦筒碾壓，便製成一種差不多透明的薄如蟬翼的輕紗了。這種薄紗，因爲含有漿質，故能把兩塊剪碎的紗，在熱度與壓力之下，令其重復　合起來而不露一點痕跡。所以，將來裁製的衣服，可以沒有衣縫，縫衣匠也母需針綫，祗要一具燙衣服的熨斗便够了。　　（三）不濕不汚不縐縮　　還有令人驚奇的事情。　　化學家們發明了一種藥品，塗在衣服之上，可以經洗不縮。而且塗過這種藥品的衣服，不易起縐，經久耐用。　　欲使衣服在雨中不會淋濕，祗須把它浸在一層錏類的豐質化合物中，則雖在傾盆大雨之下，那件衣服還是毫無水痕。　　上述化合物還能使衣服不染污跡。假如衣上不愼　有墨跡，祗須用該藥水一沖，墨跡即時消去，而衣上便有着一層看不見的保護性的　質了。床上的　褥，用該樂水洗過以後，便可多用一倍的時間。　　還有一種呌做「維寗」的化學原料，與棉花，羊毛等織在一起，可以製成堅牢經穿的衣料，而且這種衣料永不縐縮，用以製成衣眼，也永遠不會走樣。　　（四）鷄蛋花生變衣料　　化學家們發現：凡是所有的蛋白質，都能製成纖維。於是鷄蛋，花生，海藻，鯨魚的脂肪，南瓜子，雞毛和樹皮，都被製成了衣料。也許將來你頭上的呢帽將有一部份是用牛乳的纖維所製成的呢。猜拳新語  陳普雲　　一個領袖　二黨開誠　　三島求降　四强同盟　　五院會議　陸空待命　　七七舉義　八月滬戰　　九九簽字　全球歡騰　　（不受酬）美國人  葉　　美國人的奇特處，正是他們自家不曾注意到的那些日常生活的瑣事。　　歐洲史是一篇黯淡的陳稿；美國史是一部緊張的小說。　　在歐洲，窮人羨慕富人；在美國，窮人急盼自己變作富人。　　美國是世界文明的發電廠。社會服務　仁慈療養院　爲小學敎師免費醫病　　盼諸君來館領取證件赴錫療養　　無錫仁慈療養院上海辦事處陸步洲君來函云：逕覆者，接讀二月廿日送來大函，並病人證明文件等，均經收到，在二月下句適鄙人有事赴外埠，於三月二日返滬，以致遲延奉覆，甚歉！承貴處選擇合格者四位病人，現由鄙人備函請共直接至錫，惟須先聲明者，如病狀沉重，則敝院不予收容，以免往返，枉費　資，另有三位病人，並非敎師，照章不能例外，旣蒙貴處代爲要求减低，自應予以酌减，按照目下敝院住院收費最低價目每日二千元，以七折計算，嗣後如蒙　貴處介紹病人，須照院章辦理，綠敝院經費有限，尙希　諒，相應函覆，即請查照爲荷。此致申報館一社會服務處　　編者按：前經本處審查合格者，爲劉桑·徐友較·曹季孟·陳榮琪四君，另有陳亞鳳·毛漢卿。黃次毅三君，並非敎師，准予减費，以上諸君，請於日內來館領取證件，即可赴錫療養。一切章程，均照上函所開辦理。答復讀者　　本報社會服務欄，爲備讀者諮詢疑難問題起見，特延聘夙負聲望之學者專家爲顧問，代爲解答。暫定範圍如左：（一）工商企業，（二）文化敎育；（三）醫藥衛生；（四）法律質疑；（五）職業指導。讀者如有關於上項問題諮詢時，文字以簡潔明瞭爲主，問題有普遍性者，登報公佈，吾則由本欄以書而個別函復。　　張寅恭問：晚係螟蛉子，養父早亡，養母素性頑劣，抗戰以後，王某覬覦養父遺產，與養母苟合，儼然以家主自居，且爲人陰險，兼嗜黑白，不務正業，一味挑撥我母子情感，唆使養母用高壓手段，自此晚之生活益形倒懸，不得已於前月根據民國念二年度江蘇高等法院析產和解筆録向養母提出分割共有財產要求，竟遭拒絕，同時義母并停止一切生活供應顯然有侵吞共有財產之意圖，願貴欄主持公理，指示一二。　　端木愷律師答：執事如確係養子身分，則對於養父遺產，自可依民法第一一四二條請求養母　　，　遭拒絕，於親屬會議不能解次時，惟有訴求法律裁判。　　車明正問：去年十二月五日市政府公佈上海市房屋租金標準，我們大房東與二房東照理沒有問題了，可是現在仍不能解次，請先生依理答復，以便遵循。大房東由去年十月起即不收房租，市政府雖十二月五日纔公佈新法，而他們竟不顧法令，堅欲由十月起按新法征收，請問由幾月照付？新章市房照戰前房租按六十倍計算，但戰前自來水費雜費及修理費均包括在內，現在此三費大房東均早不過問，請問是否除去，然後再由六十倍計算？還是不除現在大房東，要不除二房東要除，所以無法解次，請先生公開答復。　　端木愷律師答：（一）依法律不溯既往之原則，自應從十二月份起照付。（二）自來水雜費及修理費，應否扣除計算，應以原租約有無就各該費分別載明為　。　　王義鈁問：（一）戰前在銀行裏

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] China and France agreed on the 6th on the method for French troops to take over the defense of Northern Vietnam. From the 7th, French troops can land in Northern Vietnam, but they are not allowed to carry weapons, and their lodging locations will be designated and protected by us. Starting from the 16th, we will formally hand over the defense of Northern Vietnam to the French. Furthermore, the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations concluded at 6 PM on the 6th. At 4:01 PM, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Vietnam, and Sainteny, the French Commissioner for Northern Vietnam, signed the Franco-Vietnamese agreement, which consists of six points. China and the United States were invited by both France and Vietnam to be present at the signing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] While the French side in Northern Vietnam was discussing technical issues regarding the handover of defense with us, they suddenly used five warships to forcibly land at Haiphong late on the 5th and shelled our port garrison, resulting in a clash. The conflict only stopped at noon on the 6th, with the French warships withdrawing from the port. One of our ammunition depots was hit and caught fire, resulting in over ten casualties on our side and six injuries on the French side. After the Sino-French agreement was signed on February 28th, our authorities here received orders on March 4th to negotiate technical issues regarding the handover of defense with the French. Upon learning that a batch of French troops would land at Haiphong on the 6th, both sides, citing insufficient preparation for the handover, decided to postpone the landing date to the 7th. Unexpectedly, the French side disregarded the agreement and landed ahead of schedule, and then opened fire despite our garrison's warning, leading to this unfortunate incident. After the incident, the investigation personnel from China, America, and France who went to Haiphong had not yet returned here as of 6 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Regarding the restoration of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it is reported that 150 kilometers of track between Mengzi and Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway were dismantled and moved. The Ministry of Communications is currently formulating a construction plan, and the collected materials are sufficient to lay 50 kilometers. This project will start from Hekou, so that the materials used for mine exploitation can be transported from abroad in the future.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 6th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons today: "Regarding the disposal of Japanese factories and machinery in Manchuria, the British government believes that the disposal of Japanese industries should be decided by the governments of all countries that can obtain compensation from Japan. Before this decision is obtained, all Japanese industries and resources should be temporarily kept in custody by the government where the industries are located." Subsequently, Member of Parliament Davies inquired to Bevin: "Does any government other than the Chinese government have the right to remove resources from Chinese territory?" Bevin replied: "There is no treaty under heaven that grants such rights to any country other than China."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The British House of Commons convened tonight, and members raised questions about the secret clauses of the Yalta Agreement regarding Northeast China. The atmosphere was quite agitated at the time. Davis, the leader of the Liberal-Constitutional Party, asked whether the British government considered itself bound by this Yalta Agreement. Minister of State Baker replied: Yes, it is bound by it. Davis then asked: Under what agreement was the removal of industrial machinery in Northeast China based? Baker then consulted with Prime Minister Attlee but did not immediately provide an answer. He said: If this inquiry is submitted in writing, a reply may be obtained in the future.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai stated today: China is "constantly" urging the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast and has clarified China's position to Moscow. Liu confirmed the news that the Soviet Union had removed industrial machinery from the Northeast but neither confirmed nor denied whether the central government had protested to the Soviet Union about this matter. He said: Foreign Minister Wang has clarified China's position, that all Japanese and puppet assets must be regarded as part of the compensation paid to China. This view is inconsistent with the Soviet Union's position that these assets should be treated as Soviet war booty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A foreign journalist reception was held at 3 PM on the 6th, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: The US government has requested China to inform the US of the situation of the Northeast negotiations at any time. Has the Chinese government replied?</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese government has replied to the US government.</p>
<p>Question: Since February 1st, has the Chinese government received any documents from the Soviet side regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops?</p>
<p>Answer: The Soviet authorities have informed our country that the delay in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is due to technical difficulties, but they have not specified what kind of technical difficulties.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation of the takeover of Lushun and Dalian?</p>
<p>Answer: The issue of Lushun and Dalian is related to the entire takeover of the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Soviet Union's Demands for Northeastern Industries; Our Government Cannot Agree; Reply to the United States Declares that the Soviet Union is Exceeding its Scope <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 5th] The State Department issued the following statement today: On February 9, 1946, Secretary of State Byrnes instructed the US Embassies in Chongqing and Moscow to present notes to the Chinese and Soviet governments, clarifying the US view, which reads as follows: Recently, it has been reported that officials of the Chinese and Soviet governments have been holding consultations on the disposal and takeover of industries in Manchuria. The US government is very concerned about this. The Sino-Soviet Treaty signed on August 14, 1945, stipulated that China and the Soviet Union would jointly manage certain railway trunk lines in the Manchurian region. However, this agreement did not include the specification that Manchurian industries would also be placed under joint management. The US government has been constantly receiving reports on the progress of the aforementioned negotiations, up to the point when both parties accepted this agreement in August 1945. The US government believes that the joint management of Manchurian enterprises by the Chinese and Soviet governments should be limited to the railways related to the aforementioned agreement. Therefore, the US government has received reports that the parties are currently conducting negotiations. The US government is deeply concerned about these reports, the result of which may be the realization of joint Sino-Soviet management of Manchurian industries.</p>
<p>The US Will Propose Allocating Japanese Overseas Assets</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, when people of other nationalities have not gained the freedom to enter Manchuria, and the people of the US and other allied countries have not obtained equal opportunities to participate in the economic development of Manchuria, the US government feels that such negotiations held by the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding Manchurian industries are contrary to the Open Door Policy. This will cause obvious discrimination to US personnel who are willing to participate in the development of Manchurian industries, and it will place US merchants who establish trade relations with Manchuria in a significantly disadvantageous position. Directly related to the issue of Manchurian industries is the issue of reparations policy toward Japan, because before Japan's defeat, the industries of Manchuria were mostly in the hands of the Japanese. The US government believes that the final disposal of Japanese overseas assets, such as Manchurian industries, is a matter of common interest and concern for all allied countries that bear the main responsibility for defeating Japan. The US government is now preparing a broad policy outline regarding Japanese reparations, which will soon be submitted to the governments concerned for consideration. This policy will recommend the establishment of an Allied Committee to seek reparations from Japan. This committee will make the final allocation of Japan's overseas assets among the countries that have made requests. Therefore, it is inappropriate to make a final disposal of Japanese assets in Manchuria at this time, whether it is the removal of industrial assets from Manchuria as "war booty" or the establishment of control over the ownership of the aforementioned assets by the Chinese and Soviet governments.</p>
<p>The US government is willing to cooperate with the Chinese and Soviet governments to find a solution to the above-mentioned problems, and hopes that the other two governments can show the same spirit of cooperation. The US government would be grateful if it could be informed of the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations or the actions they are about to take regarding the disposal or control of Manchurian industries. We would welcome a frank and full discussion of general issues.</p>
<p>Byrnes Announces Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Reply</p>
<p>Secretary of State Byrnes announced today that he had received a reply from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the gist of which is as follows: In its memorandum submitted to the Chinese government on January 21, 1946, the Soviet government declared that all Japanese enterprises in the northeastern provinces of China that had served the Japanese army were considered by the Soviet Union to be war booty of the Soviet army. The Chinese government believes that this request from the Soviet government far exceeds the scope of war booty recognized by international law or international practice. Therefore, the two governments have not been able to reach a consensus on the relevant basic principles. In another memorandum submitted to Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Changchun, the Soviet government declared that it intended to transfer part of the Japanese industries that the Soviet Union considered war booty to China, but the remaining enterprises, including designated coal mines, power plants, steel plants, chemical industries, and the Shuifeng hydroelectric plant, should be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese government feels that it cannot agree to this Soviet proposal because it exceeds the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945, and conflicts with the position taken by the Chinese government regarding Japanese industries and enterprises in China.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Changchun, 5th] Various signs indicate that Soviet troops in the Northeast will not withdraw before May of this year. The attention they previously paid to the Political Consultative Conference has now turned to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the upcoming Political Participation Council to be held on March 20th. Not only that, but they also personally want to see what the National Assembly to be convened by us on May 5th is all about. In conversations, Soviet officers and soldiers often reveal their concern for the evolution of our internal affairs. Government personnel from the interior and the general public generally refer to the central government as "Zhong Yang," while the Soviet army directly calls it the Kuomintang. Although this is a small detail, it is enough to reflect the callers' views on our domestic politics. The Soviet army here will soon hold combat exercises. Huge tanks, never seen before, often crawl through the city in teams. Some of the Communist personnel who previously withdrew from the city have now returned to the Changchun-Changtu railway area. Armed railway troops ride freely by car and often check passengers. On the contrary, the security forces that were airlifted to Changchun a month ago are still confined to their barracks, leading a dull life as out-of-town troops. The newspapers in Changchun were originally ordered not to publish articles attacking the National Government or harming Sino-Soviet relations. At present, this kind of ban has been abolished in a sense. Articles and texts criticizing the National Government have been published frequently in recent months, and some have been published twice. All of this is enough to illustrate that the situation in the Northeast is deteriorating.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] Yishi Bao reports: The Soviet Union continues to increase its troops in Northeast China, and its troop strength has now reached 600,000, doubling its original strength. The Soviet army is building airfields, military facilities, and new naval bases in Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Observers here believe that the tense situation in the Northeast, due to General Xiong Shihui, Director of Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters, going to Jinzhou, foreshadows new developments. Headquarters staff members are accompanying General Xiong. It is noted that General Xiong Shihui has stayed in Beiping for a considerable period of time, during which the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the Northeast issue have stalled.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has been convened for six days, and it is expected to close on the 12th. The Assembly attaches great importance to the Northeast issue, and there has been intense debate. Foreign Minister Wang promised that the government will never make concessions that would harm China's sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The sixth plenary meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held at 9:20 AM on the 6th, chaired by Chen Guofu, with 247 Central Executive Committee members in attendance. After the secretariat read the minutes of the fifth plenary meeting and reported on documents, the chairman announced the continuation of the review of the report on diplomatic issues.

A break was taken at 10:40 AM, and the meeting continued at 11:00 AM, still continuing the review of diplomatic issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The seventh plenary meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held at 3:20 PM on the 6th, with 199 members in attendance, chaired by Chen Cheng. The chairman announced the report on post-war relief, which was reported by Pu Xuefeng, Deputy Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and lasted for one hour.

The main points of the speeches were: (1) The Administration's expenditures are too large and the salaries of its employees are too special, which should be adjusted as soon as possible. Also, although the Administration's expenditures are not paid by the national treasury, they must still be submitted to the government for verification. (2) The war disasters in northern Jiangsu and Hubei provinces are particularly severe, and effective relief should be provided quickly. (3) Relief materials should be strictly managed and rationally distributed to ensure that every material can be returned to the people bit by bit. (4) The Administration's officials at all levels should be selected domestically and do not need to recall students studying abroad, in order to increase expenditures. (5) Materials shipped from abroad that are not suitable for rural use can be publicly auctioned first, and the cash can be used to purchase suitable items for distribution to rural areas. (6) Provide funds to send righteous people back to their hometowns as soon as possible and find ways to make a living for them.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Return to Chongqing Yesterday; There are Rumors of a Mediation Group Being Sent to the Northeast <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall and their entourage flew back to Chongqing from Hankou at 12:30 PM on the 6th.</p>
<p>[United Press, This Port, 6th] Today, sources close to US Special Envoy General Marshall claimed: The entire Northeast is within the scope of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters in Beiping. It is expected that a "cessation of conflict" on-site observation group with US representatives will soon have to be sent to the areas in the Northeast that the Soviet Union has rejected American observers. It is stated that the "cessation of conflict" agreement signed in Chongqing on January 10th does include the Northeast. It is said that the unfortunate impression that the Northeast is not under the jurisdiction of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters occurred during a press conference held when the headquarters was being formed. At that press conference, the three members of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters stated that the Northeast was not within their jurisdiction. Another reason is the fact that the on-site observation group has not yet entered the Northeast. The source close to Special Envoy Marshall continued: The recently completed plan for the reorganization and unification of the National and Communist armies also clearly includes the Northeast. This plan stipulates that the reorganization of troops should begin immediately, so sending an on-site observation group to the Northeast in the short term has been regarded as an urgent matter. (Note: A recent report from a visitor to the Northeast stated that the Soviet Union is arming the Chinese Communists in the Northeast "for political and propaganda use." This report mentioned the possibility of the above plan becoming complicated when implemented.) The central government, it is said, is unwilling to allow the observation group to enter the Northeast, fearing that this action may arouse the hostility of the Soviet Union. China's relationship with the Soviet Union is already tense. The Communist Party, it is understood, agrees to the entry of the on-site observation group into the Northeast, because it is said that the central government wants to avoid any actions that could offend the Soviet Union, the "trustee" of the Northeast. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Soviet Union could at least be invited to hold talks with the observation group on-site in the Northeast as a gesture of courtesy. However, the possibility of this has not been officially confirmed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] According to news from Jinzhou, Communist troop movements in Zhangjiakou have been frequent recently. Thirty regiments have departed from Zhangjiakou towards Rehe. Their intentions are unknown. Also, Communist troops near Xifengkou have recently departed for Rehe, with the intention of reinforcing Pingquan.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tianjin] It is reported that today, the financial market in Harbin is in a state of "extreme chaos," with most banks requesting assistance from the Central Bank. Another reason for the chaos is that depositors are rushing to withdraw funds from the banks because they were not allowed to withdraw even a small percentage of their deposits during the Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] On the 4th and 5th, the fluctuations in gold and U.S. dollar prices were minimal. The Hong Kong dollar saw a relatively large increase. On the 5th, gold was priced at 167,000 yuan, U.S. dollars at 1,850 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars at 366 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] After the opening of foreign exchange, prices in the city have remained relatively stable, but gold prices have seen slight fluctuations. In the morning, the price was 142,000 yuan per tael, briefly rising to 150,000 yuan at noon, and falling back to 146,000 yuan in the evening.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] In order to implement the established policy of freedom of the press, the government has abolished the news censorship system in the recovered areas. Minister Wu Guozhen publicly announced at a press conference with foreign reporters today that freedom of the press is the government's established policy and the consistent advocacy of the Kuomintang. Due to the war, the censorship system was adopted as a last resort. After the Japanese surrender, the government first abolished news censorship in the mainland on October 1st. In the recovered areas, it was temporarily retained because order had not yet been fully restored. Now, the government has, in accordance with its original policy, telegraphed all recovered areas to abolish all news censorship from the date of the telegram.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Rice prices in Nanjing have fallen to 21,000 yuan per stone for inferior rice, due to the continuous arrival of large quantities of rice from the Jurong and Lishui rice-producing areas.

<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 5th] In the past few days, 72,000 bags of rice, totaling thousands of tons, will be shipped back to the motherland from here to relieve the shortage of rice in some areas. Zheng Wulou, Chairman of the Association for the Relief of Famine in the Motherland, organized by overseas Chinese here, will go to Shanghai to supervise the distribution of this Siamese rice to the various disaster areas.

<h3 id="e21">Despite Fertile Land in the Northeast, It is No Longer a Prosperous Industrial Area; Soviet Troops' Entrenchment Shows Determination to Stay <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Local Dispatch] When Soviet troops will withdraw from the Nine Northeastern Provinces is probably only known to the Kremlin. However, if the Soviet troops withdraw, the Nine Northeastern Provinces will no longer be a prosperous industrial area. All kinds of machines, regardless of size, from locomotives to lathes, have been taken away by the Soviet troops as spoils of war. Yet, the Soviet war against Japan lasted barely a week. The Nine Northeastern Provinces still have vast fertile land, but they no longer have industrial potential. A qualified Chinese told the United Press reporter: "The removal seems to have two purposes. First, the Soviet Union can use this to establish its own military industry in the east. Second, if the Nine Northeastern Provinces become a battlefield again, there will be no factories for the enemy to use." Of the 5,000 large and small factories in the Shenyang area, almost all have been emptied and severely damaged. According to American journalists who have visited this Soviet military stronghold, even if the Soviet Union withdraws from other parts of the Nine Northeastern Provinces after obtaining certain economic benefits, it is still prepared to stay in Dalian at any cost. Foreign reporters stayed in the Nine Northeastern Provinces for a total of two weeks, and this reporter is the first to return to Shanghai. Most of the time in the Northeast, the reporters were accompanied by Soviet machine gunners. The impression from all aspects is that the Soviet Union has deeply entrenched itself in some areas, and only pressure greater than that from China can drive them out. A senior Chinese general in Shenyang said: "The speech delivered by Marshal Malinovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces in the East, in Changchun on Red Army Day reflects the Soviet Union's determination to stay." The staff officer also told the reporter that this statement has been "confirmed," but American reporters who were detained in Changchun for many days have yet to make any statement. In Shenyang and other cities, although Chinese and Soviet flags are displayed side by side, the Chinese have no real power, no different from being in Moscow. Also, White Russians in the Nine Northeastern Provinces are used by the Soviet Union, but generally suffer poor treatment. In short, the Soviet Union has gained a new foothold in Asia, backed by the military force of the Red Army. This secret police, spies, and intimidation ensure safety. On the surface, the Soviet Union feigns Sino-Soviet friendship, as revealed in the slogans on Red Army Day in Shenyang, but in reality, they only despise the Chinese. Their treatment of the Chinese is no different from conquered people. Heartbroken Chinese only dared to tell reporters inside the Chinese military headquarters that Soviet troops in China commit all kinds of atrocities, including rape and plunder. The Chinese openly express fear of the Soviet troops and dare not walk on the streets of Shenyang even in broad daylight, fearing being stopped by Red Army soldiers and losing their watches or money. Only a few Chinese soldiers guard the headquarters in Shenyang, because General Peng’s large army remains stationed outside the city to prevent conflicts with Soviet troops, who never leave their weapons. Soviet troops forbid Chinese civilians from carrying weapons, and violators are immediately executed, except for the mayor and his secretary, who have special passports from the Soviet commander allowing them to carry weapons. Fearing looting by Soviet troops, Shenyang stores are nailed up with wooden strips, and only third-rate goods are displayed in the windows. Only when Americans shop do they show higher-quality goods, which are usually hidden to avoid being seen by Soviet troops. Germans in Shenyang have not been affected by the Soviet occupation. According to Chinese, for two weeks after the Soviet troops entered, the Nazi flag still flew above the German club. Chinese people in Shenyang are overjoyed to meet Americans, even if they are just reporters. Upon seeing a CBI insignia, they smile and ask, "Are you an American soldier?"</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Emperor Hirohito promulgated an imperial rescript tonight, fully accepting the draft of the new constitution. The rescript states: "I wish to fundamentally revise the constitution of the Empire in accordance with the will of the people and the principle of respect for fundamental rights, and I hereby instruct the government authorities to do their utmost to achieve this."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Japanese government's decision to adopt the draft of the new constitution was the result of a lengthy and arduous discussion. The cabinet met at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and did not adjourn until 11:00 p.m. Last night, Prime Minister Shidehara and constitutional expert Matsumoto entered the Imperial Palace to meet with the Emperor for about three hours. Foreign Minister Yoshida visited MacArthur's headquarters. The cabinet continued to meet throughout the day today until 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] MacArthur's headquarters suddenly announced Japan's new constitution today. The new constitution stipulates the permanent abolition of war and forbids the training of armed forces. Sovereignty belongs to the entire people, and the Emperor has no governing power. His position is reduced to a national symbol, only presiding over national ceremonies. The new constitution has ninety-five articles, listing the revolutionary rights enjoyed by the Japanese people. The power of the House of Representatives is expanded to a true legislative body, and the hereditary House of Peers is replaced by a popularly elected House of Councillors. Article Nine of the new constitution states: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."</p>
<h3 id="e23">Absolute Equality Between Men and Women; Abolition of the System of Slavery <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The new constitution also states that if Japan wishes to occupy a glorious position in the international community, it must ensure that the Japanese constitution internally lays a solid foundation for a democratic government and externally leads the rest of the world to abolish war. Although the new constitution stipulates that the Japanese Prime Minister will be elected by the parliament, current officials can still be re-elected. The Japanese cabinet meetings yesterday and today have reached their final stage. It is expected that another important resolution will be announced within days to expand the scope of the purge of militarist elements, and the government may be reorganized as a result. The new constitution grants the people new, revolutionary freedoms based on the American constitution, including: equality between husband and wife, marriage requires the consent of both men and women, abolition of any slavery, and prohibition of forced enslavement of others except as punishment for criminals. People have freedom of thought and belief, and others must not infringe upon it, which is noteworthy in a country with "thought police." Officials are absolutely prohibited from using torture and other cruel punishments. Japanese police are not allowed to arbitrarily search and arrest people. All cases should be tried quickly without delay and must be handled in accordance with legal procedures. People have freedom of speech and religion, and the government and its affiliated agencies must not conduct religious education or engage in any religious activities.</p>
<p>The preamble to the new constitution states that the Japanese people are willing to cooperate peacefully with all countries in the world, hoping to enjoy all kinds of freedoms at home, and have decided to prevent government actions from causing the tragedy of war again. It is hereby announced that government measures should be based on the will of the people.</p>
<p>The new constitution also stipulates the establishment of a regency system, which is unprecedented in the Japanese constitution. The Imperial Family's acceptance of property grants and its expenses must be approved by the parliament. People should have equal obligations and equal rights without discrimination.</p>
<p>Japan's new constitution was drafted by the Japanese government and MacArthur's headquarters after repeated meetings over the past five months. According to MacArthur's statement tonight, the new constitution is an enlightened document, and its content "has my complete approval." According to the new constitution, the Emperor no longer holds Japanese political power. He will obey the will of the people and will only be a symbol of the entire Japanese people.</p>

<p>[United Press, Fulton, Missouri, 5th] President Truman delivered a speech at Westminster College today, following Churchill, urging full support for the UN Charter to save humanity from destruction. It is said that this is a dangerous time. The world will either move towards destruction or embark on the greatest era of progress in history. The choice is yours. "Leading the nation towards a great era and not towards destruction is my responsibility, and I pledge to dedicate my life to this path."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Fulton, Missouri, 6th] Churchill said yesterday in a speech in the auditorium of Westminster College that he believes the situation in the Far East, especially in Manchuria, is worrying. He admitted that the agreement reached in Yalta was "extremely favorable" to the Soviet Union, and he was one of the signatories to the agreement. But Churchill added: "The United States is very well informed about the situation in the Far East, and Americans are the most loyal friends of China, so I don't need to elaborate on the situation there."</p>
<p>Many U.S. Senators Oppose Anglo-American Military Alliance</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Churchill gave a speech in Fulton, Missouri, yesterday, advocating the de facto formation of a military alliance between Britain and the United States. Members of Congress today generally expressed opposition. Some senators agreed with Churchill's proposal that Britain and the United States should jointly use military bases and military preparations. Some senators said that a formal military alliance would arouse Soviet suspicion and make the United States too closely involved in British foreign policy, so they could not agree.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Newspapers here this morning published Churchill's speech in the United States in a prominent position and praised it in editorials. However, some members of Congress reportedly criticized Churchill's speech, saying that it was "of no help to the United Nations" and might subject Foreign Minister Bevin to questioning. Some members of Congress also wanted to know if the government had prior knowledge of Churchill's speech.</p>

At least 20 million tons of wheat are needed for relief in the next six months, and there is currently a shortage of at least 8 million tons.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Trade and financial experts said today that the Soviet Union must first promise to fully cooperate with the United Nations economically before the United States can consider the Soviet Union's request for a $10 billion loan.

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 6th Broadcast: Spain is tightening the blockade of the Spanish-French border, and people going to the border must carry special passes issued by the military authorities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th, United Press] The efforts of the United States, Britain, and France to overthrow the Franco government today encountered strong opposition from Franco himself. At the same time, the U.S. Congress also reacted to the declaration by Britain, the United States, and France suggesting the overthrow of Franco. Some members of Congress expressed their approval, but others believed that the United States should not interfere in Spanish affairs. Some even believed that the three countries' actions were appeasement of the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department said that it received a note from Franco twenty-four hours before the statement was issued stating that the Spanish people would never tolerate foreign interference in their affairs. The three countries' statement was addressed to the Spanish people, especially patriotic leaders and freedom-loving Spaniards, hoping that they would soon be able to safely overthrow Franco and establish a provisional government. However, Franco's determination to not step down under pressure, and the fact that the United States, Britain, and France hope that Spain will not have another civil war, have effectively hindered any immediate action to force Franco to step down as soon as possible. However, there are clear signs that the Spanish issue may be raised at the UN Security Council's resumption of meetings in New York.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Editorial: Resolving the Current Economic Crisis <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>During the fourth and fifth plenary sessions of the Second Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, many members spoke generously and emotionally about the current foreign affairs, financial, and economic problems of our country. Regardless of what secondary discussions the Second Central Committee will have on this issue, and what measures the government will take in the future, this enthusiastic scene is a symbol of the Kuomintang's rebirth. Since the long-awaited victory of the Anti-Japanese War arrived, internal and external troubles have followed in the past six months. Although victory is in hand, the national crisis has not been eased at all. Especially for the people in the recovered areas, the constant rise in prices in recent months has brought them a high degree of insecurity in their lives. The problems facing us now are the failure of foreign affairs and the serious economic crisis. The Chinese Kuomintang, which led our people to victory in the long-term Anti-Japanese War, also bears the heavy responsibility of resolving the current national crisis. During this Second Central Committee session, some demanded a change in diplomatic style, while others conducted strict reviews of the government's financial, monetary, and economic measures, which not only raised our awareness of these issues, but also carried out the Kuomintang's task of supervising the government, and at the same time spoke out the knots in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>We will not talk about diplomatic and international issues here, but we must point out the severity of the current economic crisis. This economic crisis has not been alleviated by the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and its severity is increasing day by day. If the government does not come up with measures to strictly implement, China's national economy will collapse completely; in fact, China's national economy is on the verge of collapse. The bankruptcy and decline of the middle class in recent years has made the future economic recovery of China extremely difficult. Today, more than half a year after Japan's surrender, let us think about what dangerous symptoms our current national economy is showing. Production enterprises in the Great Rear Area have stagnated, and production enterprises in the recovered areas are also stuck in a state of stagnation. The rise of new bureaucratic capital in the recovered areas not only competes with the people for profits, violating the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood, but also undermines government policies, or arbitrarily raises its own salaries, undermining the government's entire system, or takes the lead in raising prices, prompting the rise of general prices; as for the handling of enemy and puppet industries, it is especially a mess, and no one knows the details. In the recovered areas, general prices have risen more than six times in six months, making the people unable to bear the burden of life, and labor strikes have been occurring one after another, with no peace of mind. If this continues, the government and the people will both suffer, which is not a blessing for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Why is the current economic crisis becoming increasingly serious? The main reason is that the government does not have a basic policy to deal with the current economic crisis, and even if it has a policy, it cannot be implemented uniformly. This fully demonstrates the government's incompetence. An incompetent government not only fails to resolve the current difficulties, but also makes the difficulties more severe. Chairman Chiang inspects a place and pays attention to local prices, wanting to stabilize them. Our Chairman's concern for prices is indeed sincere; but why have prices in various places not only failed to achieve the desired effect of stabilization in recent months, but have instead risen day by day, rising at least six times in six months. This shows the incompetence of the government, especially the various departments in charge of finance, monetary affairs, and economics. In terms of finance, what is our national fiscal policy? During the war, there was an unavoidable reason to make up for income by issuing currency; but why has the value of the legal tender also decreased by six or seven times more than six months after the end of the war? In theory, the vast recovered areas could accommodate the already inflated currency, and the expansion of the issuing area could achieve the goal of partially contracting the currency; but why has our currency value continued to fall? We want to ask the financial authorities what policy they are taking on our currency and how to prevent it from falling again; we not only want to ask the financial authorities what measures they will take on this currency issue, but we also want to ask the financial authorities whether they have a practical plan to reorganize the currency system. The Chinese people and the government cannot be troubled by malignant currency inflation for a long time due to the incompetence of the financial authorities. This disease needs to be diagnosed and treated immediately, without delay. "Save the Legal Tender," what a pressing cry. "The主管當局有辦法說出來，無辦法想出來，有辦法挑起來，無辦法放下來" is the right step; we cannot let incompetence harm our lives. ("The authorities in charge should speak out if they have a solution, think of one if they don't, take it up if there's a solution, and put it down if there isn't" - This is a paraphrased translation of an idiomatic Chinese expression)</p>
<p>Regarding finance, there is also a rather serious problem that has not been noticed by the world, that is, the increase in salt prices everywhere, and there is a salt shortage everywhere, but the salt production in the producing areas cannot be sold externally, so that most salt farmers give up salt production and switch to other industries. The name "Salt Administration" still appears in our country, and our country still has so many "salt officials" to handle the "salt administration," which is our shame. May I ask whether there are such "salt officials" in England, the United States, or other civilized countries, who are destroying our traditional salt distribution system, and taking advantage of the situation to monopolize, but not allowing the people to freely buy and sell, so that salt prices are high everywhere and there is a salt shortage everywhere. May I ask whether such governance can be tolerated by the Principle of People's Livelihood? The "He Zheng" ("Harmony Administration") official is in charge of financial authorities, why doesn't he ask?</p>
<p>Speaking of the economic aspect, the seriousness of the situation is self-evident. Factory shutdowns, worker unemployment, the cultivation of bureaucratic capital, the obstruction of private enterprises, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau have not yet announced the whole picture, all of which make the people uneasy. We cannot let this situation drag on for a long time. The Chinese Kuomintang is the ruling party, and it has a heavy responsibility to resolve the current economic crisis. We hope that the convening of this Second Central Committee session can come up with a solution to resolve the current economic crisis. The future of the nation depends on it.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Demanding the Release of Arrested Representatives: British-Owned Tram Workers Strike; Tram Services on All Routes Suspended After 5 PM Yesterday; Chinese National Aviation Corporation Employees Begin Work-to-Rule <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Tram company employee representatives Zhang Xuekui, Qiu Changjiang, and Peng Shaolin were suddenly arrested yesterday at the tram workers' union. Workers were agitated by the arrest and rallied at the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for their release. However, they were unsuccessful. As a result, British-owned tram services on all routes were suspended after 5:30 PM as a form of protest. According to authorities, the three arrested workers were secretly reported for participating in a puppet union and for improper conduct.</p>
<p>More than six hundred employees of the China National Aviation Corporation began a work-to-rule strike after their requests for improved treatment were not met. It is also reported that employees at the Chongqing headquarters have joined in solidarity.</p>
<p>Department Store Employees Work-to-Rule</p>
<p>Employees of more than a dozen department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China National Products, Sanyo Trading, and Samsung Cotton &amp; Iron, on Nanjing Road, have requested improved treatment from their employers for many days, but the employers have not given a definitive answer. Furthermore, yesterday at noon, labor representatives attended a mediation session at the Social Affairs Bureau, but the employers did not attend, so the mediation could not proceed. All employees expressed deep dissatisfaction with this situation and decided to stage a two-hour work-to-rule from 3 PM to 5 PM as a warning.</p>
<p>Typesetting Industry Labor Dispute Mediation Unsuccessful</p>
<p>After several rounds of mediation, most of the conditions in the typesetting industry labor dispute are close to being agreed upon. However, the employers have not accepted the item of a basic salary of 45 yuan, while the labor side insists on not giving in, so the mediation has failed. It is reported that the employers have specially convened a meeting of industry members to discuss the matter, and whether they can accept it will be clear in today's negotiations.</p>
<p>Shoemaking Labor Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>The shoemaking industry labor dispute was resolved yesterday afternoon. The wages for February will be increased by 200% compared to January. Both sides have agreed, and a statement has been made stating that if both labor and management voluntarily increase or decrease, they may not be bound by this. The labor representatives have also promised to advise fellow shoemakers in East China and other places who have already gone on strike to resume work immediately.</p>

Recently, they collectively petitioned the municipal government for reinstatement and relief. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently working with the Silver and Money Shop Guild to conduct an investigation to find a solution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The High Court opened court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Cao Jun, to try two cases of traitors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Xingjian was reported to have worked in the telecommunications department of the puppet military commission during the Anti-Japanese War, and established a radio station in Nanjing, engaged in propaganda for the enemy. The High Procuratorate concluded the initial investigation and formally filed a public prosecution. The defendant was allowed to be released on bail for 500,000 yuan. The case opened for the first time yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear. The guarantor, Fan Zhide, manager of Zhenye Electric Company, turned himself in and stated that Wang is currently a technical officer at the Ministry of Communications and is waiting for orders in Nanjing because he will be assigned to work in Xuzhou. He was unable to return in time for today's hearing and requested a postponement. The court ordered the case to be postponed for further hearing.</p>
<p>Chen Bohua worked for the Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railways before the war. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he followed Ding Mocun and held successive positions in the puppet Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry. By the time of victory, he was still the executive member of the puppet two-railway party department. Later, he was reported and arrested, and the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. The case has been tried several times. The defendant claimed that although he held a puppet position, he did not forget the country. After the victory, he even tried his best to preserve all materials so that they could be transferred intact. When the hearing continued yesterday morning, the two witnesses cited by the defendant, Jin Ali and Cui Changyu, did not appear. The court ruled that the case be postponed for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Fierce Debate Between Lawyers on Both Sides – U.S. Military Court Conducts Third Trial of Ishihara Yu <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>How Can the Words "Abnormal Psychology" Absolve Him of His Crimes?</p>
<p>The U.S. military court conducted a third trial of Ishihara Yu yesterday. To demonstrate that his actions were all carried out to fulfill his duties, Ishihara Yu cut off his little finger before his arrest last year. During yesterday's hearing, the defendant was questioned by lawyers from both sides about the abuse of American prisoners of war in Jiangwan and Wusong. Ishihara Yu spoke at length in court, expounding his views in broken English. He first stated that he despised cowards and considered those in the concentration camp to be incompetent. Since they could not fight on the front lines, they should do hard labor in the rear. He also admitted to administering water torture to the war criminals, but explained that water torture would not lead to death because he himself had been subjected to water torture nine times. He also claimed to have sought benefits for everyone in the camp and resigned in 1945 because he was dissatisfied with various measures within the concentration camp. At 10:30, the lawyers on both sides began their arguments. First, the defendant's lawyers, Major Levy and Lieutenant Dona, pointed out the reasons for Ishihara Yu's crimes and asked the judges to pay attention to: (1) The testimonies from the American side were exaggerated and seemed to make Ishihara Yu's crimes more serious. (2) Ishihara Yu was the target of public criticism and has already admitted his guilt. (3) They hoped the court would investigate the circumstances of the defendant's crimes. Major Levy also explained that Ishihara Yu's crimes were due to abnormal psychology. Because the defendant was very proud when he arrived in China from Tokyo, but later obtained a small position in the concentration camp and was treated the same as soldiers, he was very distressed and vented his dissatisfaction on the prisoners of war. He took pride in beating people each time, so his beating and treatment of the prisoners of war was not voluntary. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Garland, refuted Major Levy's opinion, believing that Ishihara Yu was close to being brutal and that the four words "abnormal psychology" could not absolve him of his crimes. After the arguments on both sides were completed, the presiding judge scheduled the verdict for 3 p.m. today (7th).</p>

In addition, it was decided to establish three small group meetings and their responsible conveners: (1) Drafting Group, convened by the Bank of Communications; (2) Legal Interpretation Group, convened by Zhejiang Industrial Bank; (3) Brokerage Fee Group, convened by Citibank. The Chairman, the China Bank, immediately designated eleven banks as standing committee members: seven Chinese banks, including China Bank, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Guangdong Bank, Jin City Bank, and Zhejiang Xingye Bank; and four foreign banks, including Citibank, Chase, Mercantile, and HSBC. It is reported that the main purpose of the establishment of this association is to enable the designated commercial banks to operate foreign exchange business smoothly in order to promote the country's financial policies.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the Central Bank announced that the telegraphic transfer rate for US dollars would remain at 2020 yuan and did not change throughout the day. The foreign exchange market was relatively stable. Yesterday, several designated banks had already started trading futures. It is reported that the market price for April was 2120 yuan, for May was 2240 yuan, and for June was 2325 yuan. A few cotton and hardware foreign exchange settlements were made for April futures.</p>
<p>Various Application Procedures</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the Central Bank opened the foreign exchange market, many people are not clear about the application procedures. Our newspaper's reporter has learned the following from the Foreign Exchange Review Department of the Bank of China: Except for goods that are prohibited from import, imported goods are divided into two categories: freely importable and importable with permission. For freely importable goods, importers can apply directly to a designated bank. For goods that require an import permit, importers must first apply to the Import Management Office for an import permit and then use the permit to purchase foreign exchange from a designated bank. When exporting goods, exporters must first sell the foreign exchange from short-term or long-term exports, or re-exports, to a designated bank. Only after obtaining proof from the designated bank can they report the goods to the customs for export. However, this restriction does not apply to goods with a total value of less than US$25 and without commercial behavior. "Foreign remittances," "foreign exchange sold in China," and "all other foreign exchange" must also be sold to a designated bank. For personal legal needs for foreign exchange, such as living expenses, travel expenses, and insurance fees, you can also apply directly to a designated bank, but only up to a maximum of US$250 or 60 pounds per month. For tuition fees for students studying abroad, the limit is US$150 or 36 pounds per month. Other legal needs for foreign exchange must first be approved by the Central Bank.</p>

<p>In the middle of last month, the price of rice in the city soared, once reaching a high price of 33,000 yuan. At that time, Yang Xizhi, the special envoy for grain administration, flew to Nanjing for instructions on how to deal with the situation.

<p>Yesterday, the local gold market was weak at first. It opened at 1.49 million, but after the securities firms sold gold to switch to stocks, the process fell slightly in extreme calm. It once fell to 1.44 million in the morning. Credit was exceptionally loose, and those with funds who had not yet lent them out took advantage of the low price to absorb them. At noon, it stabilized again. Securities firms had been overly aggressive in selling gold in the morning, so their positions became loose at noon, and they made up for it by buying gold. In general, people were quite sensitive to the forward U.S. dollar, which the Central Bank raised month by month, and people were slightly agitated. It rose to over 1.55 million before becoming calmer. As a result, it closed 60,000 higher than the previous day. Ornaments rose from 1.58 million to 1.68 million. Silver ingots were low at first but then evened out and were still listed at 1,800. Silver dollars were similar to the previous day. Private interest rates suddenly loosened, with the interest rate falling from 2.2 to 1.5. The exchange rate for U.S. currency was very stable. Citibank and other banks also set the exchange rate for U.S. currency at 1940 yuan to 2040 yuan, with both buying and selling. Currency dealers, seeing that the buying price was 50 yuan lower than the market price, lowered the price of large bills by 40 yuan before they could be delivered. The opening price was 2000 yuan for selling and 1980 yuan for buying, with a low of 1960 yuan. At noon, it was around 1980 yuan. In the afternoon, affected by the price of gold, it rose back to 2030 yuan. As a result, it closed 30 yuan higher than the previous day. The U.S. exchange rate was listed at 2000 yuan, frozen U.S. exchange at 1980 yuan, April futures at 2120 yuan, May futures at 2220 yuan, and June futures at 2325 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was active and good, up 30 yuan for old goods and slightly up 23 yuan for new goods. Hong Kong power was traded at 410 yuan. Rupees were 505 yuan, all settled by yarn traders, used to settle Indian cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Rayon Spot Market Is Unique – Silk Goods Have Been Weak for Days <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no transactions for factory silk, and the depreciation in value was equal to spot goods. The prices of mid-range spot goods and dried warp were slightly better than the previous day. There were some transactions for rayon. 120 Tianqiao spot opened at 1.75 million yuan and closed at 1.71 million yuan. In the afternoon, there were calls for 1.76 million yuan, but someone wanted it. Miscellaneous brands of Dongyang silk were traded at 1.72 million yuan, with non-shiny silk 700,000 yuan higher than shiny silk. This is a phenomenon of scarcity makes things expensive. The Mei Ya bedspread market was quite firm, and although there were transactions for Da Cheng Ge Bi crepe, the price has been weak for days. Yesterday's market still decreased by 100 yuan.</p>

<p>It has been found that the natural green tea that is most appreciated by the United States, the city's tea export lines have been receiving telegrams from overseas recently. Quality ones are in short supply, so it is difficult to find them for a time. Everyone is waiting. As for the city's tea market, the volume of transactions has decreased compared to before. This is because credit is tightening, and purchases are picky. However, prices have been able to stand firm because the sellers are reluctant to lower their prices. However, as Wenzhou and Taiwan tea continue to arrive in large quantities, the buyers are loosening and the price has fallen.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Rice and Grain Prices Drop; Soybean Oil Market Also Weak <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw a significant influx of shipments arriving in Shanghai via waterways, primarily from the vicinity of Suzhou and the Sujia Road area of Wujiang Tongli. Consequently, vessels filled the riverbanks, market sales stagnated, and粳 rice continued its downward trend, dropping by another small thousand yuan. Early Bo Dao, Du Xian, and Ke Xian varieties also decreased by a small thousand yuan, though Bai Yuan arrival and sales were both scarce, keeping the market stable. The oil market experienced oversupply, resulting in a further decline of two to three thousand yuan. Soybeans dropped another thousand yuan, and soybean cakes also continued to fall by over a hundred yuan. Flour sales were minimal, with prices remaining unchanged. The raw peanut market mirrored this trend, with bran prices staying level. Overall, grain prices continued to soften.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Yarn Market Stable; Spot Cotton Transactions Improve <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw neither gains nor losses. Initially, a small amount of selling, around twenty to thirty thousand, was observed. However, with buyers showing increased interest, and customers from Beijing absorbing smaller yarn types, prices rebounded. Overall, the market saw little change from the previous day.</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions were favorable yesterday. Private yarn mills like Shenxin, Sulun, Dasheng, and Litai all made purchases, primarily of American short-staple cotton. Transactions also occurred with Tongzhou cotton. Total transactions reached a substantial twelve to thirteen hundred bales. However, the Textile Construction Company remained hesitant and inactive, and market prices remained generally stable.</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company announced yesterday that the sales prices of its various goods, including wounded cotton cloth, linen, wool serge, blankets, and silk spinning, were all lower than market prices. Specifically: 1004 grass green uniform serge was priced at 51,500 yuan, 1100 yuan riding breeches serge at 13,000 yuan, 2020 navy blue board serge at 10,000 yuan, 52 blue overcoat serge at 7,000 yuan, 155 silk grass serge at 3,000 yuan, 400 grass green serge at 7,000 yuan, 500 navy blue serge at 10,000 yuan, 157 plain color serge at 10,000 yuan, double blue line linen bags at 1,100 yuan each, colored silk spinning at 8,500 yuan, striped pot spinning at 11,500 yuan, white silk spinning at 17,000 yuan, gray blankets at 16,000 yuan, and coffee blankets at 17,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The sales of bituminous coal dust in the coal market remain sluggish, and prices are softening and declining. Though sales of white coal dust are also slow, prices remain stable.

<h3 id="e83">Strong Support from New Bulls; Chinese Stocks Soar; Foreign Stocks Also Rise <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the strict scrutiny of the authorities, public bonds saw only slight activity, with trading volume minimal, almost nonexistent. Except for Category C, all other categories were merely quoted. Initially, trading stopped due to warnings issued by patrols, stating that anyone caught trading would face ten days of confinement, causing panic. Later, the soaring Chinese stocks provided some encouragement to buyers. Category C bonds rose slightly from 1630 yuan to over 1700 yuan. At the midday close, Category A and B bonds were up 80 yuan compared to the previous close, Category C up 70 yuan, Category D up 50 yuan, and Category E up 80 yuan. Chinese stocks opened strong, carrying over the momentum from the previous evening, rising by 10%. After opening, Yongxin Silk dropped from 2900 yuan, Meiya from 2200 yuan, and Jingfu from 140 yuan for a brief period. Yongxin Silk fell to 2650 yuan, Meiya to 2050 yuan, and Jingfu to 130 yuan. At this point, established bulls and money exchangers stepped in to represent clients, but the continuous support from new bulls in the securities industry proved decisive. Some even converted gold into stocks, stirring market sentiment. Consequently, popular stocks surged by 20%, ending at midday at high prices, with significant gains of 35% for hot stocks and 20% to 30% for less popular ones. Foreign stocks also rose by about 15%. Higher prices were quoted in the afternoon, but these were mostly for delayed settlements.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Market Chatter: After the Opening of Foreign Exchange <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank implemented the free buying and selling of foreign exchange this Monday, all parties have been paying close attention. In reality, where foreign exchange is quoted and where it is freely bought and sold remains unclear to the average merchant. Importers settling US dollars must not only pay the price stipulated by the Central Bank but also bear brokerage commissions. Banks handling foreign exchange also charge additional fees. Exporters settling foreign exchange face varying buying prices from different banks, generally slightly lower than the market price for US dollars, and must also take a 97% discount. As a result, buying and selling prices diverge by over a hundred yuan. Previously, in the black market, telegraphic transfers were generally higher than US dollars, and large cash transactions were valued at a 3% discount to telegraphic transfers. Exporters could sell telegraphic transfers for more than the market price of US dollars, enjoying a premium. After the opening of free buying and selling, importers and exporters, in addition to facing various application restrictions from the authorities, simultaneously bear the handling fees for middlemen's transfers. Furthermore, the so-called quotations, except for US dollars, are based on market prices calculated by the handling banks themselves for other foreign currencies. Therefore, the solemnly established foreign exchange quotations are no better than those of money changers. Recently, the difference in US dollar buying and selling prices in small money shops is less than 30 yuan, while the buying and selling prices of US dollars in major banks differ by over 100 yuan. Moreover, calculating other foreign currencies based on market prices rather than using official rates shows no improvement over small money shops operating in the black market. Yesterday, futures trading was implemented, with prices increasing by 100 yuan per month, the opposite of previous forward foreign exchange. Speculative psychology has become somewhat sensitive. We hope that open foreign exchange trading will have complete foreign exchange quotations, and the range and spread should be narrowed as much as possible. A reasonable calculation should be made for foreign currencies other than US dollars, ensuring that speculators have no opportunity to exploit. Prevention is better than cure; the time is now.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Outdoor Exercise Fields: Popular in America <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Outdoor exercise fields in cities are becoming increasingly popular as the public places greater emphasis on physical fitness. In the 19th century, only a few children's playgrounds were organized by schools and community groups. However, since World War I, with the increasing frequency of street traffic, the need for such outdoor exercise fields has become more urgent to allow children to play in fresh air after school without danger. America is vigorously promoting this. Shown is a group of children in New York City, on the Atlantic coast of America, practicing volleyball on an outdoor exercise field run by the municipal government.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Highest Institution of Higher Learning on the Plateau of Xikang: National Xikang Vocational and Technical College (Part 1) by Jin <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Seven years ago, when Xuzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou fell to the enemy one after another, and pessimists shortsightedly doubted the strategy of protracted war, the establishment of Xikang Province was like a strong ray of light, shining in every corner of China, awakening the deluded from their dreams, and exposing the faces of traitors. A large number of engineers and various experts poured into Xikang, and the slogan "Develop Xikang" was on the lips of people in the interior and appeared in every newspaper and magazine in the rear.</p>
<p>Dr. Li's Creation</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Dr. Li Shutian—a hydraulic engineer and director of Beiyang Institute of Technology—led a group of people to Xichang, the wealthy Tibetan center of Xikang. There, boundless reserves of iron, copper, zinc, and coal existed, and untouched forests and pastures awaited development and utilization. After Dr. Li completed his investigation, he immediately wrote a report, which, in addition to reporting its wealth, also suggested establishing a specialized school, including agriculture and engineering, to cultivate cadres responsible for developing resources. Because the war of resistance was a long-term and constructive undertaking, and the development of all resources was the only capital for long-term resistance, it was naturally necessary to establish a specialized school to take on this important task.</p>
<p>After multiple trips and numerous plans, under Dr. Li's efforts, the new sign of "National Xikang Vocational and Technical College" stood proudly in Xichang, a remote and often regarded as uncivilized area.</p>
<p>A New Type of Institution</p>
<p>The original plan was to establish a university. However, due to the circumstances at the time and the urgent needs of the war of resistance, they adopted two specialized systems—three-year and five-year—which was the first of its kind in the country. The former recruited high school graduates, like a regular university, providing three years of specialized training. The latter recruited junior high school graduates, providing five years of specialized training. The first two years covered the general high school curriculum, and the last three years were the same as the three-year system, focusing on specialized courses. In this way, it could compensate for the insufficient academic time of a general four-year system, avoid unnecessary subjects in the four years of university, and shorten the duration of study, creating a large number of cadres. There were only three such new types of institutions in the country. In addition to "Xikang Vocational and Technical College," there was a "Northwest Vocational and Technical College" in the Northwest, offering only a five-year agricultural program, and a "Central Vocational and Technical College" in Leshan, Sichuan, focusing on light industry departments such as papermaking and leather manufacturing.</p>
<p>Heavy Industry Departments</p>
<p>"Xikang Vocational and Technical College" was the lucky one among the three. Under Dr. Li's leadership, heavy industry departments were established. In addition to mining and metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and civil engineering, there were also agriculture and forestry and animal husbandry. He brought the spirit he had at Beiyang Institute of Technology to found "Xikang Vocational and Technical College." Although some said it was "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut" and "a waste of talent," he worked tirelessly for the nation, for the country, and for education, regardless of criticism. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], a large number of young people from the border regions were recruited in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, and the first class began on Mount Lu in the scenic area of Xichang.</p>
<p>The departments established at that time have already been mentioned above. Among them, the mining and metallurgy department only accepted high school students, while the mechanical engineering and chemical engineering departments only accepted junior high school students. The other three departments accepted both high school and junior high school graduates. At that time, the professors and staff, even the librarian, were from Beiyang Institute of Technology. The professors of agriculture were also nationally renowned scholars. The "Xikang Vocational and Technical College" at that time could be called its golden age.</p>
<p>Factories and farms were also established at the same time. The books, except for a few newly purchased, were mostly remnants of Beiyang Institute of Technology. The instruments were also borrowed by Dr. Li. For example, the civil engineering department had four theodolites and three levels, half of which were from Zeiss. Many chemical and mineral specimens were also donated from various sources.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Cultivating Mental Stinginess by Suoyin <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Stinginess is the opposite of generosity and is criticized by people. But most people think that stinginess refers to material things; in fact, there is also stinginess in the mental sphere, and those who are mentally stingy are probably more numerous than those who are materially stingy.</p>
<p>For example, a person who is unwilling to easily teach or impart the knowledge and skills they possess unless there are conditions; who is unwilling to tell people good news; who is unwilling to express joy when hearing others talk about their successes; who is unwilling to express sympathy when others encounter misfortune; and who, in ordinary times, is unwilling to show a little smile, say a few pleasant words, or praise others, these are all forms of mental stinginess.</p>
<p>Apart from stinginess with knowledge and skills, the rest belongs to emotional stinginess, which is what is called "coldness," "indifference," or "unfeeling." Sometimes, being emotionally generous is more difficult than being materially or physically generous. There are many people who would rather give you money, materials, or even let you work for them, but are unwilling to offer you a kind word or facial expression. They may claim to be "naturally arrogant," but this is actually selfishness, which leads to the same end as material stinginess.</p>
<p>Excessively wasting emotions or using them inappropriately certainly has its drawbacks, but moderate and appropriate use of emotions is necessary, which benefits both others and oneself, because humans are emotional animals. Therefore, if you want to be a successful person in human society, you must make good use of emotions and be generous in using emotions.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Physiological Monocular No Worries by Zhong Zuo <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In industrial accidents and wartime injuries, many people unfortunately lose one eye. These monocular individuals often become passive and pessimistic due to various fears.</p>
<p>Monocular individuals often think that their field of vision is only half that of a normal person, but in reality, the difference between the two is very small and not important in comparison. The judgment ability of monocular individuals for short distances (within one or two feet) is indeed lower than that of normal people. For example, they may sometimes spill coffee on the saucer or have difficulty threading a needle, and they often perform poorly in mechanical work that requires precise measurement. However, these situations will disappear with a little care and patience.</p>
<p>Generally, monocular individuals often worry that one eye doing the work of two eyes will easily be damaged. This is not true. When the eye is first damaged, there may be feelings of eye fatigue or headache, but this is only temporary. If monocular individuals rest their eyes frequently in the first few weeks, they can still do things that require concentrated vision and do them well without any danger.</p>
<p>Monocular individuals often complain that their appearance is completely ruined, but today's advanced surgery has overcome this difficulty. Modern plastic artificial eyes are almost exactly the same as real ones.</p>
<p>British naval admiral Nelson was a monocular; the current British Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, is also a monocular; a monocular American pilot even flew around the world and broke records; and the famous American surgeon Wheeler lost one eye in the middle of his medical career, but he continued to train himself to perform surgery on patients.</p>
<p>Monocular individuals don't need to worry! Long-term psychological fears will ruin your life.</p>
<h3 id="e99">International Racial Self-Esteem and Discrimination by Yang Mou <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Germans and Japanese both have a high sense of superiority towards their own race. The outbreak of this war can also be said to be largely due to the mischief of this psychology, leading to the arrogant ambition to dominate the world. But on the other hand, don't the British and Americans also have arrogance towards their white race? I think everyone knows about their discrimination against people of color, so I don't need to elaborate.</p>
<p>This psychology of respecting one's own race and discriminating against other races may be a common human trait. This trait promotes the continuous development of human civilization, and it is also this trait that causes humans to engage in insane massacres like wild beasts. However, this trait is very exceptional in China.</p>
<p>The plight of overseas Chinese, who suffer discrimination from the governments of their host countries, is too much to describe. Take the recent example of Siam, where there was a massacre of overseas Chinese. Only because China has always been a weak country without diplomacy in recent centuries, overseas Chinese can only accept discrimination, without a trace of resistance, and live a life of humiliation.</p>
<p>Domestically, because of the unequal treaties over the years, the minds of the general public have retained a psychology of respect for "foreigners." Although consular jurisdiction has now been recovered and unequal treaties have been abolished, the shadows left by this psychology have never been eradicated. On a small scale, many institutions, and even many of our national institutions, have significant differences in the treatment of Chinese and foreign personnel. Personnel doing the same work are paid far more to "foreigners" than to "Chinese," and the reason for this is truly inexplicable. On a large scale, although the consular jurisdiction of "foreigners" has been abolished, they still seem to enjoy certain privileges. I have personally witnessed several times when the police have taken a blind eye to the illegal behavior of "foreigners."</p>
<p>From the Opium War to the present, China has experienced countless hardships and suffered countless losses. Now, we have finally joined the ranks of the powerful countries. We painfully reflect on the past and feel that our losses are no greater than the loss of this psychology of respecting our own nation.</p>
<p>Once, a person was taken to the police station by the police for violating traffic rules, but another "foreigner" who committed the same offense passed by leisurely. The person questioned the police, and the police replied, "Why didn't you reincarnate as a foreigner?" The speaker was unintentional, but how heartbreaking it was to the listener.</p>
<p>We do not hope to discriminate against other races, nor do we want to boast ourselves recklessly, but we must maintain the dignity of our own race. We should not discriminate against other races, nor should we be discriminated against by other races.</p>
<p>Consoling the wounds that our nation has suffered for a hundred years cannot help but arouse infinite emotion in us. Standing on a new foundation and making new efforts is already the time. Everyone should respect themselves and respect our own nation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">People: Mrs. Churchill by Andong <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In England, when you mention Mrs. Churchill, everyone will say, "Mrs. Churchill? Oh, she's really amazing!" If you ask again, "What makes you say that?" they will explain, "Well, you know, she's just amazing!" Thinking further, another adjective that can be used to describe her is that she is very charismatic.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill is a beautiful woman. Her appearance contributes to the good feelings that the British have for her and her husband. Because the British tend to have a romantic inclination towards beautiful women. They like to say, "This is our old Churn, look how beautiful his wife is!" Older people remember London in the gaslight era. They often saw Miss Hozier (Clementine Hozier, Mrs. Churchill's maiden name) and her mother inseparable. Mrs. Churchill is still a remarkable figure today.</p>
<p>She is also quite athletic, playing a good game of tennis. She is an excellent athlete in every season. Experts who are considered to have learned to ski in the nursery are surprised by Mrs. Churchill's continued fitness in her old age. The determination she shows when skiing is the same as the determination she shows in anything. Not long before the war, one winter, she even announced that she would participate in a famous official ski competition. At that time, the younger and more experienced members were shocked. Because the weather was snowy, they were worried that she would at least break four or five bones. Unexpectedly, she reached the finish line, still full of energy and without any injuries.</p>
<p>Another sport she plays well and enthusiastically is croquet, which is not the refined game in British garden parties as people imagine. The famous playwright Noël Coward is one of her good opponents. She likes to go to the theater and enjoys socializing with actors.</p>
<p>Like her family, she likes French movies, old music hall songs (Churn has a very rich collection), and American magazines.</p>
<p>Those who know Mrs. Churchill say that she is a very progressive Liberal, although Churn tends to be a Conservative. For thirty-five years, they have respected each other as guests. When Churn takes weekend breaks, they always play cards quietly.</p>
<p>A London tailor went to 10 Downing Street to fit Mrs. Churchill with a new dress. Churn, wearing pajamas and with a cigar in his mouth, walked into the room and watched gently. The tailor remembered: "Mrs. told him where she was going that day and told him not to come back too late. Mr. said, "Yes, dear." Just like an ordinary man."</p>
<p>Even if Churn is an ordinary man, Mrs. Churchill's concern for his career would not be any different.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Inventing the Latest Inventions in Clothing Materials by Zuoyou <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>For thousands of years, the methods of weaving fabrics have remained unchanged: cotton is spun into yarn, and yarn is woven into cloth. This method has undergone unprecedented innovation recently due to the advancement of the chemical industry.</p>
<p>(1) Colorful Damask Does Not Need Weaving</p>
<p>The first new method of making cloth is like this:</p>
<p>Cotton fibers are first combed into a fluffy sheet like wool, and then pressed tightly between rollers, becoming a thin layer. Then, a special paste is applied to the surface, so that each cotton fiber is tightly adhered together and no longer moves. This paste is not only white and colorless, but also can be mixed with various brilliant colors, printed on the cloth, and draw various patterns.</p>
<p>After the colored paste is dried on a warm cylinder, the cloth is made successfully. In an instant, cotton raw materials have become colorful damask, while old-fashioned looms still require more than a dozen complicated procedures.</p>
<p>This new type of cloth is cheaper than old-fashioned cloth, firstly because it is simple and quick to manufacture, and secondly because it saves more raw materials for the same amount of cloth. For example, one pound of cotton can only weave eight yards of thin yarn on an old-fashioned loom, but if a new method is used, it can produce twenty-four yards of towels. And that new type of cloth is also extremely dense, while even the finest cloth on the loom is still full of pores.</p>
<p>(2) Cicada-Wing Gauze Clothing Seamless</p>
<p>The second method of making cloth is even more wonderful.</p>
<p>A pulp-like fiber is mixed with cotton fibers, and then pressed with a hot roller, and a kind of almost transparent gauze as thin as a cicada's wings is made. This gauze contains pulp, so it can repeatedly combine two pieces of shredded yarn under heat and pressure without revealing any traces. Therefore, the clothes to be tailored in the future can be seamless, and the sewing worker does not need needle and thread, just an iron for ironing clothes is enough.</p>
<p>(3) Non-Wet, Non-Staining, Non-Shrinking</p>
<p>There are more amazing things.</p>
<p>Chemists have invented a medicine that can be applied to clothes, which can be washed without shrinking. Moreover, clothes coated with this medicine are not easy to wrinkle and are durable.</p>
<p>To prevent clothes from getting wet in the rain, just soak them in a layer of ammonium-based rich compound, then even in heavy rain, the clothes will still be free of water marks.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned compound can also make clothes free from stains. If there are ink marks on the clothes, just wash it with the medicine, and the ink marks will disappear immediately, and there will be an invisible protective quality on the clothes. Bedsheets and quilts can be used twice as long after being washed with this medicine.</p>
<p>There is also a chemical raw material called "Vining", which can be woven together with cotton, wool and other materials to make strong and durable clothing materials, and this kind of clothing material will never wrinkle, and it will never be deformed when used to make clothing eyes.</p>
<p>(4) Eggs and Peanuts Become Clothing Materials</p>
<p>Chemists have discovered that all proteins can be made into fibers. So eggs, peanuts, seaweed, whale fat, pumpkin seeds, chicken feathers and bark have all been made into clothing materials. Perhaps in the future, the woolen hat on your head will be partly made of milk fiber.</p>

<p>Hoping that everyone will come to the library to collect certificates to go to Wuxi for recuperation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Buzhou of the Shanghai Office of the Wuxi Benevolent Sanatorium wrote: "In reply, I have received your letter of February 20, along with the patients' certificates and other documents. I happened to be away on business in the lower reaches of the river in the lower sentence of February, and returned to Shanghai on March 2nd, resulting in a delay in replying, I am very sorry! I appreciate your selection of four qualified patients, and I am now writing to invite them directly to Xichang. However, it must be stated in advance that if the condition is serious, our hospital will not accept them, so as to avoid wasting money on travel. There are three other patients who are not teachers, and no exceptions can be made according to the regulations. Since you have asked us to reduce the fees on their behalf, we should give them a discount. According to the current lowest price of our hospital's inpatient fees, which is 2,000 yuan per day, we will calculate it at 70%. If you introduce patients in the future, you must follow the hospital regulations. Since our hospital's funds are limited, I hope you will understand. I am replying to this letter accordingly, and please check it for your reference."</p>

<p>This newspaper's social service column is specially employing well-known scholars and experts as consultants to answer questions and difficulties from readers. The tentative scope is as follows: (1) Industry and commerce enterprises; (2) Culture and education; (3) Medicine and health; (4) Legal questions; (5) Vocational guidance. When readers have questions about the above items, the text should be concise and clear. Questions of a general nature will be published in the newspaper, otherwise, this column will reply individually in writing.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingong asked: I am an adopted son. My adoptive father died early, and my adoptive mother is naturally unruly. After the Anti-Japanese War, Wang Mou coveted my adoptive father's inheritance and cohabited with my adoptive mother, pretending to be the head of the family. He is also insidious, addicted to gambling, and does not engage in proper business. He constantly provokes my mother-son relationship and induces my adoptive mother to use high-pressure tactics. Since then, my life has become increasingly difficult. I had no choice but to submit a request to my adoptive mother last month to divide the jointly owned property based on the property division settlement record of the Jiangsu Higher Court in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], but was rejected. At the same time, my adoptive mother stopped all living supplies, obviously with the intention of embezzling the jointly owned property. I hope that your column will uphold justice and provide some guidance.</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: If you are indeed an adopted son, you can request your adoptive mother for your adoptive father's inheritance in accordance with Article 1142 of the Civil Code. If you are refused and the family meeting cannot resolve the matter, you can only seek legal judgment.</p>
<p>Che Mingzheng asked: On December 5th of last year, the municipal government announced the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rent Standard. Our landlord and sub-landlord should have no problem in principle, but the matter has not been resolved yet. Please give me a reply based on reason so that I can follow. The landlord has not been collecting rent since October of last year. Although the municipal government announced the new law on December 5th, they insist on collecting according to the new law from October, ignoring the law. Please ask from which month should I pay? The new regulations stipulate that the wartime rent should be calculated at 60 times the pre-war rent, but the pre-war water bills, miscellaneous fees, and repair fees were all included. Now the landlord no longer cares about these three fees. Please ask whether they should be deducted before calculating 60 times, or should they not be deducted? The landlord does not want to deduct them now, but the sub-landlord wants to deduct them, so the matter cannot be resolved. Please give a public reply.</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: (1) According to the principle that laws do not apply retroactively, you should pay according to the new law from December. (2) Whether water bills, miscellaneous fees, and repair fees should be deducted for calculation depends on whether the original lease specified each of these fees separately.</p>
<p>Wang Yifang asked: (1) Pre-war small national currency deposits in banks; (2) Central Savings Association's fixed-term lottery savings; (3) Packages lost by postal bureaus, railway bureaus, and other agencies during the war. How should the compensation be assessed?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: It should be handled in accordance with government orders.</p>
<p>Zhang Jie asked: I am a former judicial officer. I never joined any enemy or puppet organizations during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. I heard that I can re-register. Is this true? Please reply!</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: You can register with the High Court.</p>
