<h3>國大開始二讀憲草　主席新自出席說明數點　今日下午繼續舉行大會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國大主席團會議第二十六次會，廿一日下午六時舉行，由梁寒操主席，繼續討論憲政實施過渡辦法，未獲結果，定廿二日上午十時舉行第廿七次會，限予討論。又主席團定廿二日上午開會，決定當日下午三時舉行之第十五次大會主席人選。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國大第十四次大會，廿一日三時半舉行。朱家驊主席，出席代表一二七八人，蔣主席與夫人均出席，坐國民黨代表席次，宣佈開會後，蔣主席以國大主席團代表身份，出席報告。主席着黃色軍便服，精神甚佳，登發方臺後首稱：諸位代表，今日主席團推本人代表向各位有幾點說明。本人今日乃以代表之資格，向各位報告，現在憲草第一讀已經通過，恐仍有不能使全體代表滿意者，茲特說明如次：</p>
<p>（一）國都問題：當起草時，余意無列入憲法必要，後因我國憲法之基本原則，對美國冠法方式採取較多，故予列入，原草案係定都南京，第一審查會審查結果，通過改爲北平，國大乃一難得盛會，希望能使大家滿意，故國都一點可以不列入憲法。</p>
<p>（二）第五條中華民國各民族一律平等，有許多人主張將滿族加進去，但該條文內已說明各民族一律平等，實無另加滿族必要。</p>
<p>（三）第百廿條之後所加之一條，其修正條文共爲兩條：關於蒙古者，本人認爲蒙古各民族地位一律平等，關於西藏者，條文爲「西藏地方自治制度應予以保障」地方二字，可以不要。</p>
<p>（四）一三二條第一審查會決議第十二章加一條，規定各種選舉婦女當選名額，至少佔百分之二十，本人認爲不必規定，但在選舉時應特別注意。</p>
<p>蔣王席報告時會塲掌聲不絕，報告畢，開始第二讀，由洪秘長宣讀全部憲草，並由主席逐條徵詢意見，無異議即予通過，共計宣讀四章，自第一條至第五三條，全部通過，其中第七條因係定都問題，遵照主席說明，不必列入，全體同意予以删去。第二八條修正案，原爲國大代表每六年改選一次，每屆國大代表之任期至次屆國大開會之日爲止，其中原有「國大代表不得兼任官吏一款」，旋因綜合會決議删去，今日會中復提出，並再度修正爲：「現任官吏不得當選代表」，當經表決以九九六票之大多數通過之，餘均照一讀通過。</p>
<p>其略有討論者，約有下列數點：（一）第五條宣讀時，滿族代表畢天民起立發言，準備有所說明，但因當時會塲空氣稍有混亂，畢代表登發言台後第一句即稱：「本人是滿族代表，對第五條請諸位洗耳靜聽」。出語不愼，引起全塲譁然。案呼：「下去！下去！」噓噓之聲不絕，質詢爲什麼要洗耳靜聽？當時畢代表仍欲發表意見，由陳誠上前歡慰兩次，始悻悻而下。事後據陳稱：畢代表乃一飽學之士，在美學衛生有年，惟還來有病，故出言不愼。又溥匿亦表示滿族代表均遵照蔣主席之指示而無任何種族之意見在內，惟會塲一時陰於混亂，孔庚於畢代表下發言臺後，亦曾以激烈之驟色勸慰之。（二）第九條有章士釗等兩項提案，略有討論，仍就原修正案通過。（三）第卅八條史尚寬曾有提案，認爲要將「行政院長」改爲「關係院院長」，决由王世杰說明副署權之意義與重要，當付表決，史案少數否決，仍照原草案通過。（四）第四十一條原草案總統有大赦權，而修正案則無，本日會議復有人提出應照原草案，當經表決，仍照修正案通過，總統無大赦權。大會於下午六時散會，洪秘書長宣布：廿二日上午無大會，下午三時舉行第十五次大會，繼續第二讀。</p>

<h3>憲草總綱第一條　逕付二讀會討論</h3>
<p>除第七條外大會完成一讀工作</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國民大會第十三次大會，二十一日晨十時四十分舉行，出席代表蔣中正等一三四五人，主席胡適領導開會如儀，並報告遼寗區域代表王秉謙，於今晨三時患腦充血逝世，全塲爲之起立誌哀後，報告員宜讀第十二次會議紀錄，洪秘書長宣續主席團報告三事：（一）會期再延二日。（二）法定人數之解釋。（四）處理各審委會審查結果之「進行程序」（見另條）。胡主席當於解釋後，以第一·三兩點徵求意見，會衆立即鼓掌接受，並決定二十二日星期日仍照常全日開會。胡主席　稱：二十日要求發言之六十位代表，多係對憲草第一及第七兩條提出意見，唯第一條依「進行程序」第一條審委會決定維持原草案者逕付二讀會，不再討論，第七條本日亦暫不討諭，繼續完成一讀工作。湘工代表劉志平起而要求第七條須付討論，胡主席答稱：該條尚在進行協商工作，俟有結果後再提出二續會討論。旋由陳誠補充報告綜合審委會工作五點：（一）憲草第五十八條立法院行使覆議權之表決人數問題，第三審委會審查結果爲「全體」立法委員三分之二，綜合審委會修改爲「出席」立法委員三分之二。（二）婦女當選名額百分比問題，第一審委會決議於十二軍加一條「各種選舉，應規定婦女當選名額至少佔百分之二十，共辦法以法律定之。」綜合審委會删去「至少佔百分之二十」等八字。（三）業蔽地方自治制度問題，綜合審委會依第八審委會意見，並將賣　分開加列兩條「蒙古各盟旗地方自治制度以法律定之」，「西藏地方自治制度應予以保障」。（四）第十二章內地土著之國民代表選舉問題，綜合審委會依第一審委會決定之原則，於十二章增加一條「內地生活習慣特殊之國民代表名額及選舉，其辦法以法律定之」。（五）對於增進邊疆民族利益，綜合審委會依第二第八兩審委會之決定，並採擇第八審委會議決之條文於第十三軍基本國策中加列兩條：「國家對於邊疆地區各民族之地位，應予以合法之保障，並於地方自治事業特別予以扶植」。一國家對於邊疆地區各民族之敎育，文化，交通，水利，衛生，及其他經濟，社會事業，應積極舉辦，並扶植其發展，對於土地使用，應按其氣候，土壤性質，及人民生活習慣之所宜，予以保障及發展」。</p>
<p>十時零五分，陳氏辭畢，開始讀憲。洪秘書長以極淸晰之語音逐字逐句，一條一章宣讀。胡主席依「症行程序」每條徵得會衆同意予以處理，或決定以原文付二讀會，或決定以原第×審委會意見付二讀會，或決定以綜合審委會之意見付二讀會。進行至第七條，第一審委會之審查修正文「中華民國國都定於北平」，甫由洪秘書長讀出，烈如風暴之掌聲，即應聲而起，繼續達三分鐘之久。胡主席當於掌聲過後，建議以憲草原文及審查修正文並送二讀會討論。劉志平再起反對，提請胡氏注意尊重第一審委會之大多數意見。胡氏當答謂：於此條之原則變動，綜合審委會尚未有所決定，請俟二讀會時再予討論，如有修正意見，亦請依議事規則第二十四條辦理後，送秘書處轉主席團提出。洪秘書長乃繼讀宣　以下條文，除第三十一條因以上有關數條修改後已失作用，依第二審委會之審查意見删除不論外，餘均順利讀過，以綜合審委會修正意見原第×審委會修正意見，及原文之次序付二讀會。十時四十五分至十一時零五分一度休息，並於十一時五十六分，十二時十五分再次延續後，至十二時廿五分讀畢。胡主席聲稱：憲草一讀工作全部完成，關於過渡條款之提案數件，已由秘書處交達主席團，一俟整理就緒，即提出大會報告討論。洪秘書長宜佈午後三時繼續開會後，於十二時三十分散會。</p>
<h3>滬民營報紙代表團　在京請低利貸欵　蔣夢麟徐柏園允予協助</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕上海各民營報紙十二家晋京請求低利貸款代表團抵京後，廿一日作竟日之活動，據該團發言人章蒼萍談：該團上午赴政院宋院長，適宋氏及蔣秘盡長均因出席國大，由秘書李循和接見，常允轉呈院長。該團旋走訪四聯總處徐秘書長柏園、徐氏對各報困難情形至表關懷，允於收到中宣部公文後，立即提出四聯理事會，並健可能從中帮忙。下午五時許，各代表再赴政院謁見蔣秘書長夢麟，蔣氏允將各報之呈文立轉中實部，轉請四聯總處從遠辦理，蔣氏並稱：「請大家放心，只要有一家報館獲得貸款，各家都無問題，日前上海各晚報之請貸呈文，亦併轉中宣部辦理」。該團定廿二日分訪彭部長曁各有關方面。</p>
<h3>憲法討論程序　主席團提請大會核定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國大十三次會議席上，主席團報告三事，原文如次；</p>
<p>（一）大會會期後經決定延長至十二月廿一日，即將屆滿，爰經決定，再延長二日。</p>
<p>（二）准牟代表震東等動議，國民大會組織法第十二條內「過半數」，及「三分之二」以上之數額，應如何計算一案，經函請國民政府轉交司法院統一解釋法令委員會議決，計算國民大會組織法第十二條所謂出席代表之過半數，與三分二之總名額，在依選舉方法選出之代表，以其應行選出之名額爲準，在由國民政府遴定之代表，以經國民政府遴定公布者爲準，復查國民大會組織法第十二條後半段，關於通過憲怯時代表出席人數及同意人數一節，並經提報第二十次主席團會議，鄭重研討，以憲法草案百一讀會廣泛發表意見，以迄審查委員會審查，至二讀會逐條討論時，始終尚未達到通過憲怯之決定階段，蹬以議事規則第三十六條：「第二讀會修正議決之條款文句，得由主席團交原審查委員會或指定代表若干人整理之」，自不能認爲即係組織怯第十二條後半段所指定之通過，共條文意義已屬明顯，如在二讀會時，即適用組織法第十二條後半段三分之二之川席，及四分之三之同意之規定，則二讀會决議各條文後，憲法即已通過何須有三讀會之階段，於此尤足確證憲法之通過，即在三讀會，換言之，在三讀會通過全部憲法時，必應有三分之二以上之出席，並經出席代表四分之三同意爲之，當經紀錄在卷，謹特提出報告。</p>
<p>（三）中華民國憲法草案業經各審查委員會分別審查，其須經綜合審查委員會審查者，並經綜合審查委員會討論決定，先後報告大會。依議事規則第三十四條規定審查完竣之議案，經審查委員會說明其審查之經過及結果後，就大體討論，議決：或開第二讀會，或再計審查。茲爲使會議進行</p>

<h3>專論　幣制改革的時機問題</h3>
<p>— 俞增康</p>
<p>近來對於幣制的改革，市塲頻有謠傳，當局雖不斷的闢謠，但仍不斷發生，且每次請起，都引起市塲的風波，使人民不得不深切關心；同時學者亦已紛起討論；可知幣制問題，已成爲當前經濟上亟待解決的一們嚴重問題了。</p>
<p>幣制受了戰時的破攘，固須盛理，但怯幣制度，有無再維持的價值？幣制是否須要重建？是值得首光考慮的問題：第一，怯幣膨脹至此，一切交易上和記帳上，都已感到不便。第二，物價上漲已六七千倍，漲勢即使立刻停止，人民對物價過高的感覺，仍難去除，因此輕幣重物的不良觀念，無法矯正。法幣信用不能重恢，則畸態的經濟怎能重上正軌？勢將妨礙戰後經濟的復興和建設。第三，現時我國在國際經濟上的地位，業巳大爲提高，但如此幣值過低的法幣，決不能鞏固國際上的信用，而能肩負此調劑國際金融，穩定國際通貨，發展世界貿易和促進世界繁榮的艱巨使命。基上所述，無論爲國內或國外的需要，混亂的幣制，都有速即改革的必要。所以幣制的改革，在事實上，早已不再是要不要的問題，而不渦是一們時間上的問題吧了。</p>
<p>改革幣制，必須愼擇時機，否則必將徒勞，且更易引起不必要的波動，在今日人心浮動，經濟紊亂之際，允應愼擇時機。所謂時機，是在能訊速恢復幣價，穩定幣值，和縮短經濟的混亂時期之際，使改革幣制，最易收效。學者對此一問題，頻加討論，但以各人見解不同，因而主張遂不一致。</p>
<p>時賢很多主張即時改革的，藉改革幣制以安定經濟。如能蓬到安定經濟的目的，當然可取。他們所持的理由，不外下列數端：第一，法幣已失去人民的信心，必須速即重建幣制，始能恢復幣信，減緩通貨的流通速度，物價遂能述到穩定的目的；第二，財政的平衡，必須在幣值穩定的新幣制下才能完成；第三，幣制改革，必須在經濟安定後實施，則不知將待雜何日，不如速即整理，俾能安定，而有利經濟建設的展開；第四，現今市塲已深受法幣的騷擾，與其延長擾亂的過程，不如用快刀斬亂麻的手段，重新調整。上述數點，雖不無理由，但亦不免似是而非。</p>
<p>（一）即時改革幣制，在改革技術上，頗多困難。第一，物價尚在波動，而即改革幣制，究將幣值穩定於何點？第二，各物的上漲程度，又多參差，各地間亦有巨大差異，其將以何物何地爲標準？如以上海爲標準，則將犧牲廣大的內地之穩定；如以平均一數之物價指數爲準　，則在參差之下，對各產業的影饗亦將不同，仍難免有顧此失彼之憾。第三，對匯率的決定，須考慮貿易的動向，和國際收支的情况，在今對外經濟關係尚未健全建立而貿易亦未進入正軌之際，更難預測。在技術上的困難不能克服之前，幣值即加以規定，孰知其爲有利？又有誰能保證其長期的穩定？</p>
<p>（二）即使能得合理的標準，使匯價與物價重復均衡，但在生產衰弱和貿易逆輯之際，使幣值的維持，更將感到不少的困難。任何一方面的變動，即足破壞均衡，如感不適時，再欲調整，幾不可能。因爲：第一，幣制改革後，幣值如再變動，必將軍失信心，且其所可能產生的不良現象，必將更甚於今日，改革之舉，豈非徒勞；第二，匯率如作固定性的決定後，便須受國際貨幣基金的的東，如再欲調整，須在六個月之後，且幅度不得超過百分之十，豈非將受穩定外價犧牲內價的痛苦了？總之，對穩定物價沒有把握之前，改革幣制，不可不愼重。</p>
<p>（三）在不穩定的幣制下，欲求財政收支達到絕對的平衡，固不可能；但在目前立即改革幣制，使有穩定的幣僅重復出現，在客觀條件限制下的財政，恐仍難有所裨益。因爲在財政在積極整理之下，仍留有巨大差額，而此差額決非經濟上的揹置所能消除，故藉改革幣制以平衡財政之說，實難置信。財政繼續須賴發行以彌補，則雖重建幣制，其幣信何能鞏固呢？是恐幣制的即時改革，非但無助財政的平衡，而新幣制仍將爲不平衡的財政所破壞吧？况財政的整理，如能積極推進，在今法幣制度之下，亦尚有接近平衡的可能性，何不待財政整理有相當成績後，再改革幣制，庶能奏效。</p>
<p>（四）欲由改革幣制以重建幣信，而降低通貨的流通速度，在此改革條件不具備之際，這種效力決不能持久的，迨至人民發現新幣制又有不合理之處，則騷擾必又重起，仍將陷於不堪設想的地步。況今人心極度浮動，對幣制改革並無好感，反有恐懼的心理，試觀市塲一有改革之謠，即起極大波動，如此欲得暫時之功效，亦不可得。</p>
<p>（五）生產的增進，固須在幣值穩定之下，始能實現；但今生產衰落的原因很多，幣值動盪，不過其一，其他尚有更難解決的因素在焉，所以改革幣制即能重振產業之說，亦難嚴信。生產與消費的均衡關係，破壤已久，欲期恢復，當亦非一蹴可成。均衡狀態不能重復，物價即難趨穩定，物價不穩定，幣制雖改革，又有何益呢？</p>
<p>（六）至於市塲的整理，欲由改革幣制以達成，似亦爲捨本逐末之道。市塲的擾亂，固由幣值動盪而加甚，但尚有更多的問題，在於其本身的缺陷。本身缺陷存在，即使能有穩定的幣值，市塲亦難有安寗之日。市塲在戰前，早已爲投機氣氛所範罩，即可爲蹬。况今即時改革幣制，能否重建幣信，尚有疑問，其於投機濃厚的市塲，恐亦難有所刷新。</p>
<p>由上所述，由改革幣制以達安定經濟，在現狀之下，恐不可能，非但幣制重建將爲徒勞無益，且經濟混亂，反將加甚。况在法幣制度，經濟的絕對安定雖不可得，但相對穩定尚有可能。以最近的事實而觀，物價雖仍繼續上漲，但在當局的緊縮政策之下，波動輻度已無過去之甚。如實爲有穩定物價的決心，和整個而有效的對策，我們相信上漲的程度必可再爲縮小，且物價上的任何突變，亦可避免。在物價漲勢减弱之時，投機活動即爲激减，囤積之風亦可大殺，無論金融市塲和商品市塲都會獲得相當的安定。且投機减退，物價漲勢緩和後，率即告下降，產業的借鈑地位得以改善，裨益生產，良非淺鮮。依過去的經騐，可蹬經濟的相對安定，和嚴重問題的部份解決，在法幣制度下尚可實現。至於幣制改革，一經實施、，必須成功，不可專作第二次的整理。如果失敗，幣制改革非但失信於民，尚將有損於國際金融上之地位。目前實施，失敗的可能很大，何不採謹愼之措置，在經濟較獲相當的安定後，再施改革，比較妥善。欲速不達，反多弊害，對我國經濟發展前途有重大關係的幣制問題，是不可輕率從事的。</p>
<p>考世界史　，改革幣制的途徑有二：其一，改革在先，安定經濟在後。採取這種途徑的國家，大半是幣制，已臨崩潰階段，舊幣沒有再存在的必要，且在舊幣下，欲求經濟的相對穩定，亦已不可得，而混亂程度，又達於極點，非重建幣制不能克服。在此種情形之下，新幣制的建立，不必再顧及舊幣的價值，對與舊幣兌換率和新匯率，都可任意決定，而無較備上的困難。在幣制重建後，乃努力於整理財政和振興生產，便能獲得經濟的安定。其二，改革幣制在安定經濟之後，此爲幣制雖已惡性膨脹，但尚未臨崩潰階段；且舊幣仍爲人民所接受，尚有暫時存在的價值；雖已至必要改革的階段，但尙可獲相對的穩定；此種改革，有很多的技術上的困難，沒有　　簡單。現今我國的法幣情形，類於後者，所以改革上所採之步驟，不能捨本逐末。</p>
<p>時擬的選擇，於施行的能否成功，有訊大關係，其不可不審償。由上所述，幣制改革，須以經濟安定爲前提，所以目前會非其時，須待至經濟有相當安定後，才是改革的時機。所以目前尚須努力於安定經濟的指置，俾作爲改革幣制的準備工作，準備充分，將來改革幣制，自能輕而易舉。</p>

<h3>日本空前地震海嘯　較關東大地震尤爲劇烈　三島震撼死傷千人災區範圍擴大</h3>

<h3>美原子管制計劃　原則上已獲通過　任命小組委會研究內容　蘇要求延期討論遭否決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖二十日電〕聯合國原子能委會今日在原則上，通過美國之原子能管制計劃。此乃今年六月討論管制問題以來首决表決，可謂美代表巴魯克之局部勝利。巴氏堅持對其遠大計劃，作是或吾之表決，但終於順從加拿大之折衷辦法，規定在原則上接受而任命小組會研究，使計劃內容與聯大會最近通過之裁軍決議相符合？最後表決十對零票，波蘭棄權，蘇代表葛羅米柯拒絕投票，使向主席稱，「余並不參加此種討論」，但聲明此舉並非棄權之謂。蘇聯要求延期一星期討論及波蘭提議將美國提案直接交與小組會，不示可吾，均遭否決。</p>
<p>會談歷三小時，葛羅米柯聲明無時間研究美國之提案，故此時一不能參加表決。葛氏一再要求委員會給予一星期考慮之時間，中英兩國代表私人促請葛氏贊同加拿大之折衷案，亦被置之不顧。</p>
<p>美國提案中要點之一，要求對於違反原子管制之處罰，不受否決權的束，此點立即引起各代表之揣測，即小組會於起草報告書時，是否將解釋此句與聯大會之裁軍決議相符，因聯大決議中僅規定調查違的行動時，不受否決權約束。美國提案之其他要點，有（一）設立原子能國際管制機關；（二）設立國際監察制度；（三）禁止原子武器之製造與應用；（四）逐步實行管制，美國依管制階段之進展，而宣布原子秘密。</p>

<h3>參照二次大戰經驗　美重整作戰部隊　積極從事建立「三樓師團」　在海陸空採取機械化動作</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二十日電〕美陸軍地面部隊總司令第伐斯將軍今夜宣稱：美國將參照第二次大戰所獲經騐，整頓美國之步兵及裝甲部隊。在增强步兵實力五分之一後，我人可增加砲兵戰具三倍，並提高火力三倍餘。此次計劃之目的，在於建立一種「三棲師團」，俾在海陸空方面進行迅速之機械化動作。在第二次世界大戰時，V2火箭向比利時及英國方面之我軍及民衆繼續進襲，直至我方地面部隊深入施放地點，消减納粹掩護軍隊，並摧毀各該地點及火箭砲庫房爲止。在未來戰爭中，我方地面部隊之目標亦同，非俟我步兵，裝甲部隊及砲兵降落敵人機塲；火箭砲施放基地，並予以毀滅，則敵人決不中止對美國本身人民這進襲。此後美陸軍在戰事中之力量，每師團可由一萬七千增至一萬八千人，該二次大戰額增加三千人，但爲節省人員及配備起見，目前美國每師團之人數爲一萬四千人。至於新裝甲師團入數將爲一萬五千人，依照一一次大戰之經騐，每裝甲師團增添步兵一營，此外並增加重坦克一營及砲兵與高射砲各一營。在配備方面，最重要變動之一，厥爲增添一種足可運載人員五百三十人之運输機，裝甲師團之輕型坦克將减少，但中型坦克則將增加。在步兵方面每師團將增加獨立坦克及高射砲各一營，增添迫擊砲，俾可提高火力百份之五十，步兵小隊，每隊自十二人减至九人，工兵營則增舔集四營及造橋工兵一班。</p>

<h3>史末資憂慮　白種人地位　聯合國機構代表人數　有色人種佔三分之二</h3>
<p>〔路透社南菲普里托里亞二十日電〕南非總理史末廣今日在此間之招待會中稱：聯合國機構等於人類之機會，其中有色人種之代表超過白人，故白人之意見甚至有半數不獲通過，此一世界機構所代表之人類，有色人種佔去三分之一，故莫餘三分之一之白色人種必須奮起。白人者爲世界之統治者，今猶爲世界之統治者，但此項統治地位，今後能賡績幾時，則殊難逆料。</p>

<h3>論日本新憲法</h3>
<p>……日本議員與內閣以及糊塗的日皇都不要民主，他們只爲了應付麥克阿瑟……（美國新聞電）</p>
<p>美國遠東問題專家拉鐵摩爾，於十二月四日撰文論日本新憲法，其要點如左：　在日本新憲法裘面，我們實在找不出一點導源於日本傳統的思想，這裏面主要的思想全是英美的。</p>
<p>不錯，爲了使日本成爲君主立憲國，吸收大量英國思想是需要的，可是被當作藍本的英國君主立憲政體，實在並無成文法可稽，英國只有一備不成文法，它包括着那些長期歷史中演化出來的程序與先例。因此這次模仿的結果是十分有趣的。</p>
<p>憲法的前言，開頭就帶有張烈的美國口氣：「夫國政乃受國民所嚴肅託付者，其　咸來自國民，其權力由國民代表行使之，其福利由國民享受之……」可是道條文並沒有完全取消了「天皇」的紳聖權利，天皇的職權雖有規定「天皇乃日本國之象徵，…其地位基於主權所存在之日本國民之總意」，可是他的被准予保留「天皇」的稱號，「天皇」一詞，明明是指「天命的」或「紳聖的」皇帝。</p>
<p>這一點雙重的矛盾使人想起一件事實：即英王雖然唯一的任務是向新選的議會發下一項訓諭，至今仍被稱爲「上帝恩准的」國君，不過英國和日本的分別是：英國人人知道這種僅僅表示效忠的事例只是一種儀式，這種皇家在議會裏的權力，也只是政治上的舉行故事。可是在日本要令普通人民能認淸帝制儀式與民主政治之間的差別，還先得有若干次成功的普選，許多程序的建立。</p>
<p>日本的戰會由衆議院與參議院組織，兩院當爲新憲法機構的活動部分。它們在許多地方同英國上下兩院此美國參衆兩院更相類似。日本的衆院每屆四年，但是像英國一樣如果政府認爲有重新舉行普還的需要時，議會可以解散。參院議員每屆任期六年，每隔三年改選全數議員的一半。參院在衆院解散時，仍保持不動，這點也和英國一樣。外參院還可以　置衆院所巳經通過的法案，不過英國下院如逢到這種情形，只要它還能形成一種多數的壓力。最後還可以凌親上院，使法案付之實行。</p>
<p>至於日本憲法上作爲行政機構的內閣，與作爲內閣首腦的百相，也令人感到像英國制度而不像美國制度。可是在另一方面，立法·行政與同法的三權分立又極像美國而不像英國</p>
<p>當前的大問題是這個東補西綴的日本憲法，究竟能使日本社會的實際政治力量改變到何等程度？</p>
<p>自然日本今天並沒有人自欺，以爲一個民主憲法在起草，辯論與最後制定時，現在的日本議會一慛閣以及糊塗的天皇會迎合潮流而有所作爲。事實是他們都不要民主，他們只爲了應付麥克阿瑟。</p>
<p>所幸的是日本已經有許多爭論極烈的問題，這些問題的爭論，足以促成憲法草案包含國家現實政治生活的必要而合理的過程。日本目前的議會雖然充浦了反動份子，對於天皇私產這種問題的討論，也下能加以抑阻了。此外最高法院脫離行政系統而獨立的正確定義以及勞工政治權利兩問題，也都是生動而主要的論題。</p>

<h3>世界白銀　大量流美　紐約銀價下跌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕大批白銀正自世界各地，運至紐約市塲出售，結果此間銀價爲之突然下降·此項白銀係來自中國·西班牙·倫敦·印度及中東國家·其中一部份原係蘇聯所有，後由中東國家及印度買進，再運至此間輯售。此間墨西哥及加拿大亦仍繼續以白銀售予美國，雖其他國家銀價高於美國，但白銀仍向此間集中。如孟買銀價現的等於美金九角七分，較此間貴一角二分。數月前印度銀價爲每盎斯美金一元三角。各國以大量白銀在此間市場出售，足以反映各該國白銀持有人均欲換取美元購買美貨。</p>

<h3>茶業不勝高利貸負担　籲請政府收購存茶　五團體昨午舉行會員聯合大會　推定請願團代表晉京陳訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國茶業協會，上海茶輪出業同業公會，上海市茶行商業同業公會，上海市茶葉商業同業公會，東南茶區場廠聯合會，於昨日下午二時，假新生活俱樂部舉行會員聯合大會，討論請求政府收購茶葉問題。由唐季珊任主席，各代表相機陳述茶業苦况，強調政府即刻收購之必要。</p>
<h3>歸納意見</h3>
<p>歸納各代表之意見，可綜合如下：（一）存上海之茶葉約二十萬箱（十萬擔），價值約三百億國幣，折合美金九百萬元。惟以現行匯率折合海外市價計算，只能售五百萬美元。此四百萬美金之差額，完全由於外匯匯率規定不合理之故。（二）輸出業代表意見：華茶外銷不振之原因爲：綠茶因日本茶之競爭，銷路致受影響。日茶每磅僅售美金三角八分，而華茶需售美金八角一磅。紅茶之銷路，因印度錫蘭茶之傾銷而受影響，印茶錫茶在海外每磅售價在美金四角五分以下，非華茶所能競爭。目前上海存茶之價值約三百億元，除去七十億元之工貸，其餘悉由商人自行籌款，如政府不能早日收購，則茶商將不勝高利貸之負擔。</p>
<h3>東南茶代表　建議兩點</h3>
<p>（三）東南區代表意見：目前物價上漲一萬倍，但外匯不過漲一千倍，以致茶葉每擔之實際成本達三十萬元，而售價只達八萬元。現杭州區之茶農茶商已半數失業，政府如再不設法，將影響內地之生產，而使失業者更衆。特建議兩點：（甲）迅速收購已製成之茶葉，至遲陰曆年關前必須辦竣。（乙）明年貸款，應提早發放，使茶商能作再生產之準備。（四）茶商代表意見：目前自製茶之收購價格，較茶貸茶之收購價格爲低，頗不合理，因自製茶之成本較茶貸茶爲高，希望政府能同等辦理。</p>
<h3>擬請减息　免征所得稅利</h3>
<p>（五）絲業貸款之利息爲一分八厘，而茶貸之利息爲六分，同爲外銷貨物，而待遇不同，殊不公允。擬請政府實行减息，以昭大公。（六）據聞根據中蘇易貨條約，我國需償還蘇聯一百五十萬美金之茶葉，近悉政府擬以現金償清，而不以茶葉償欠，聞訊之下，不勝驚奇，如詢問屬實，當據理力爭，故請以實物償付。（七）近來英美商人向我定茶者頗多，但以匯率關係，作價過低，不能成交，故唯有政府收購，方可解決問題。（八）請政府顧念茶業之艱難，免征所利得稅，以减輕成本。各代表發言達兩小時，最後由孫曉村作結論，大意爲：（一）今年已製成之茶不足廿萬箱，國外之需要達過此數，今日茶業之困難，全爲不合理之外匯政策所造成，茶商本身無責任。（二）政府現正致力於减少進口，增加出口，觀乎行政當局之謀國棉自給，增加國菸生產，均爲明證。明年可能爲「出口年」，對於有歷史之華茶，當不致忽視。我人過去所努力者爲華茶外銷市場之保持，而非一己之生意問題，政府對此點應加以承認，對於茶業界之要求，不致採討價還價之態度。（三）唯有收購方能解決問題，因收購方可使茶商之資金解凍，作明年再生產之準備。同時，茶在茶商手中，因付利息之故，負擔日增，成本日重，政府收購後，成本即可固定。</p>
<h3>通過組請願團</h3>
<p>辭畢，全體通過組織請願團之提議，旋即依據包括各區代表之原則，經選出壽景偉唐季珊·孫曉村·葉世昌·韓若衡·范和鈞·陶振聲·陳壽伯·鄭培鳳·錢樑等二十一人爲請願代表，即日晋京向有關機關面陳苦衷，要求儘速收購，並附帶商討　息免稅等事項。同時即電呈國民政府行政院經濟部財政農林部，請求政府爲國茶前途計，爲輸出貿易計，指撥本年度全國茶葉收購資金專款國幣七百億元，知創設或指定適當機構，從速在產茶各區按照各項箱茶成本，即刻分別集中收購。</p>
<h3>資委會機廠產品多　自由車暢銷京滬綫</h3>

<h3>市警局戶籍行政　歸自治機關辦理</h3>
<p>市政府頃奉行政院訓令，略謂「市」之戶政機構，因舊戶籍法施行細則規定由警察局辦理，因此院轄市省轄市及省會所在地在市政府及區公所設置戶政機構外，同時警察局亦設有戶籍科室，辦理戶籍事務，形成變軌並行，事權不一，久爲各方所誤解，而於市區戶政工作之指導監督，尤感不便，現在修正戶籍法及其施行細則，業於本年一月三日及六月廿一日分別由國民政府及行政院公布施行，依照修正戶籍法第六條，暨戶籍法施行細則第三條第五條之規定，市政府應於民政局設戶政科，未設民政局之市，於市政府設戶政科，市之各區，比照縣之鄉鎮，以區長兼戶籍主任，並設戶籍幹事，及按保設戶籍事務員云云。市府奉令後，已分飭切實遵辦。</p>

<h3>乍浦路標賣房屋　三日內勒令遷讓　敵產住戶大恐慌　推代表分頭請願</h3>
<p>自敵偽產業處理局委託中央信託局第二次標售敵偽房屋以來，各里弄房屋住戶，以多爲老房客，值此房荒聲中，無法遷讓，投標者亦深恐引起糾紛，故鮮有問津。中信局乃改變方針，將少數房屋先行提出標售，勒令住戶遷讓。前日由警備司令部通知乍浦路四二一號及四二五號等住戶，限於三日內遷出，否則強制執行，以致引起本市居住敵偽房屋全體住戶之恐慌。各里弄乃推派代表，於昨日赴市政府，敵產處理局，中信局三機關請願，請求停止標售勒遷，各代表於十時先至市府，適吳市長公出，乃由何秘書長接見，何氏對於各里弄住戶之痛苦，深表同情，允轉達吳市長。各代表出市府後，再至敵偽產業處理局，中央信託局請願。至下午五時，又折回至市府謁吳市長，適市長舉行會議，仍由何秘書長接見，何氏對各代表表示，請願呈文已呈市長閱過，現已由市長函各敵產處理局，對於業已標售之敵偽房屋，請予維持原租戶之繼續租賃權。至警備司令部勒遷乍浦路房屋住戶，容轉達市長接洽，當不致立即執行，市長對於市民，決當盡力維護云云。</p>

<h3>中國工業合作協會　在困難中努力不輟　抗戰開始以後逐步擴展　經費支絀影響黨務推進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國工業合作協會，原是在抗戰發生後，爲救濟失業工人而設立，當時上海工廠相繼倒閉，失業工人逐日增加，上海工業界人士爲培養國力，扶持工業計，一方面把各工廠中的機器作價變賣或設法轉運內地，一方面採用以工代賑的方法，組織工業合作協會，使失業工人在可能範圍內得到合理的工作。當時的基金，多由各方捐助　集，以及政府撥發的一部分。京滬淪陷後，隨戰事遷移到漢口，才正式成立協會，推孔　　爲理事長，理事會設常務理事三人，會務進行，多由常務理事會商決定。理事會以下爲幹事會喝國際委員會，分　業務進行，和國際間貸款捐款等事宜。因爲財力不足，英美援華貸款成了主要的財源。二十七年以後，協會逐步遷移，逐步擴展，事務所和合作社，遂普遍分佈於內地各省。合作社最多的時期，約有二千家，內部組織與小型工廠相倣。在協會統理之下，由消極的救濟事業，改變爲積極的工業擴展。內地各省設有事務所的，如四川·廣東·廣西·河南·河北·陝西·甘肅·湖南·湖北·雲南·綏遠·福建·浙江等處，星羅棋佈，盛極一時。其後因戰事蔓延，經費短紬，各合作社有的毀於砲火，有的被迫撤銷，協會在種種困難中，支撐殘局，努力不懈，直至勝利爲止，協會才又重新遷移到上海。據目前統計，各省設立的合作社大約只剩了一千家不到，最近協會方面由行政院核准，撥發十萬萬元作基金，唯至今尚未發下，同時收復區各省，向協會接洽，請求廣設事務所與合作社者，爲數甚多，然以經費關係，無從辦到。照目前情形而論，維持現狀，充實內部組織，已屬最高目的，欲求擴展，尚有待於國內局勢之清朗，與經費之充裕，最近協會中有一部分人士主張將會址遷移到漢口，唯以交通及經費等關係，一時尚不能決定。</p>
<h3>棉紡業年終獎金　勞方要求已讓步</h3>

<h3>戰前銀元存款涉訟又一起　判決仍照千倍償還　原告本利千元要求折算銀價　認爲於法無據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前銀行存款，要求以銀元或肌紋銀價格折合償還之一訟案，昨日下午二時，由董推事宣判，其主文云：被告應價還原告每人一百萬元，原告其餘要求駁回。其理由略謂：原告沈浩明，沈翠齡，沈美齡，沈榮齡等四人，分別於民國十九年廿年各存銀元二百元於中南銀行，當時未曾料到十五年後幣值如此低落，如仍依原額償付本利一千元，則顯失公平，但銀元早經政府明令廢止，故償還銀元或依紋銀市價折算之要求，皆於法無據，現法院參照實情酌量裁判，被告中南銀行應償還原告沈浩明等四人，每人各一百萬元。按此案原額爲一千元，今判償還一百萬元，又爲一千倍。地院本年判處戰前存款債務以一千倍償還者。此次已爲第三件。第一件爲陳季琳與四行儲蓄會之訟案，第二件爲跑馬廳債券案。</p>

<h3>房捐與建設捐估價　如有懷疑可請重估</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局因本市一般市民對於秋季房捐及市政建設捐之征收方面，頗表懷疑，昨特解釋如下：目前房捐繳款通知書所列估定廿六年租值，並非常時谷該房屋之實際租金，此在前公共租界及前法租界區域內，均係根據前工部局及前法公董局之佔價，現此項估價底册檔卷，完全保存在財政局內，市民倘有疑問，可隨時到財政局查閱底册。　其中前公共租界部份，係能公共租界工部局鑒於轄區內所有自用及出租房屋租價高低不均，並有朦報租值情形，遂於民國廿九年聘請上海中外名建築師組織一估價委員會，將全區房屋大量繪圖，就各該房屋之廿六年地價造價，與實際租金，並參照房屋用途，地段，結構，新舊，裝修，內部設備狀況等，編定廿六年公允估率，再依各住戶房屋面積乘以公允估率，估定各該房屋之公允租值。此項租值在計算上極爲審愼，估價確定後，曾將估價數額絡續通知各住戶，並以之爲根據，征收捐稅，當時市民亦無異議。財局於去年接收後，亦即按此根據，繼續征捐，始終未有變動。至於前法祖界區內之廿六年佔定租值，係前法公董同估定，該局亦向照此項估值征稅，惟其估價情形，不若前公共租界詳確，市民倘認爲此項估值有欠公允之處，可逕向財局申請重估。至廿六年以後絡續添造之新　，亦係照以上辦法絡績估定。</p>

<p>外股昨開出即漲起少許，新買紛來，一再拉高，買氣甚殷，結果較前收計業廣升二成，會德豐紙業航業鋼業各升半成，怡紗英聯各漲一成。</p>
<h3>金鈔狂漲之下　絲綢全被帶好</h3>
<p>昨日在金鈔在漲之下，絲綢亦被帶好，人造絲一二〇號有光旭字牌子晨開三百五十五萬元，迄午收盤回小做四十六萬元，比週四大七八萬元，高山做四十三萬元，東洋做五十萬元，半光比週四亦大十十十萬元左右，三〇號雪塔籠無光，上午成交六十六萬元及六十七萬元，塲中雖現貨充斥，而喊價地無餒氣，廠經更露鋒芒，喊價一致向榮，市況混亂，全日成交只一二担，係實銷廠商需股而忍痛購進，據該業中人云，秋蘭絲每担成本需六百萬元以外，故廠絲價上升亦屬意中事，綢貨因原料高昂而使人心振奮，被面喊九十萬元，格子　縐九千元有成交，　錦　更俏，做三千七百五十元，人絲羽紗比較遜一籌，高檔做關六百五十元。</p>

<h3>煙煤塊漲勢勁</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤塊，配貨極稀，市價仍於競買中拾級而上，較前市又猛漲達成許，烟煤屑較爲緩和，亦漲一二萬元，白煤前漢陽輸進來之全淸鴻　塊，業巳開盤，每　價一百萬元，九十九萬元成交不寂，雜鴻　塊似仍九十萬元左右，焦作塊賣戶自動喊低二萬元，以圖競爭。柴炭各貨去路蟬聯，市氣挺秀。</p>
<h3>與審議價格相差太巨　米市無正式交易　油餅雜糧亦一致上漲</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬一千餘石，內地各產區均昂，赤金飛奔，人心波動，南北粳喚價猛漲二三四千元，緣離開審議價格太巨，故市塲南南南北兩處均無正式成交，僅中關南粳少數略交，高貨全無市價，自兀適值冬節，銷化活潑，續見飛躍三四千元，陰元隨之上漲三四千元，秈米亦少做開，但午時人心較淡，油市以各路到貨尚接，呼吸較少，廠方亦有供應，生油增加二三千元，豆油亦昂二三千元，淸迪因價目已低，店胃轉濃，回漲三四千元，菜油亦加二三千元，蘇油隨之挺升二千元，麵粉去化　頗香燥，再漲千元，麩皮亦然，續升千元，豆餅則因外埠銷化平常，仍少上落，黃豆本街　胃暢旺，價漲三五百至千元，惟平湖杜豆平平，菉豆南洋仍貧，步張千元，赤豆以汕頭台　動辦，猛躍三千元，紅糧以酒價上升，酒坊爭購，上漲千餘元，　豆依然站局，芝蔴廣方仍辦，市勢牢立，生仁廣帮納胃加強，再挺一二千元，小麥續高千餘元，豇豆莞豆汕頭繼續問津，奈無貨應市云。</p>
<h3>貿易辦法更改後　電影器材暫緩運華</h3>
<p>據悉我向美定購大批電影器材，原定年內可以運抵上海，惟我政府修正進出口貿易暫行辦法後，該批器材美方已暫予緩運，聞須待許可證核准，及配額問題決定後，始可啟運。</p>
<p>又本市電影器材如攝影機，放映機等，目前均惑缺乏，允以膠片爲最，據最近調查所得，是項存貨尚可維持數月，惟底片多於面片，若欲印製多部拷貝，勢必發生困難。</p>
<h3>化學工業維持困難</h3>
<p>本市化學製造工業，戰前有會員百餘家，月前僅存其半，能維持之工廠祇有七八家，其餘皆至奄奄一息之巾，據業巾人稱，目前化學原料外貨輪入甚多，國貨難與競爭，更因國人心理以爲化學原料必須採購外貨，方爲可靠，因此生產品銷售更受嚴重影饗。</p>
<h3>工協要求輸管會　放寬工業原料限額　允許若干工廠補行登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中中中國工業協會上海分會，於昨日下午五時許，假該會襄陽北路新會址，邀宴輪管會執委會秘書處處長陳長桐，限額分配處處長李榦，及中央銀行外匯審核處副處長徐先達等。該會理事長吳蘊初，常務理事榮鴻元（張孟昭代），金潤庠，總幹事莊智煥，幹事田和卿等均出席。席間工協方面提出問題兩則，請求　客會方面予以協助：（二）分配限額時，對工業原料一項，應請接受工業界之建議。（二）對工業原料之入口，應請放寬限額，並應直接分配予各工廠，以免中間商剝之削。李榦氏當表示：當局對工協所提原則，早在考慮之中。政府之立足點，終爲整個工商業着想，決不爲少數人牟利。惟查各種工業，情形各殊。如棉紡業情形，即較收單純。對其他繁複之工業，當亦審慎處理。總之，一切望能依所提原則循序做去。旋陳長桐氏對於工協所提第一問題表示：輸管會將分聘工商業各界專家，維織一諮詢會議，俾便多所諮詢，而收集思廣益之效。</p>
<p>金潤庠氏旋提出：目前工業原料之輸入，確成問題。例如紙漿之外匯，目前無法結取。李榦氏對獲取工業原料之困難，甚表同情。惟稱：情形複雜，最根木之解決辦法，不出：（一）設法增加原料生產，（二）節省原料之消耗量。除此之外，別無治本辦法。</p>
<p>最後工協方面要求：各工廠雖已有向轍管會直接登記，以便取得進口之資格，茲查尚有若干工廠，仍未及於限期前登記者，望輸管會能允予補行登記。陳長桐氏當允代向全體委員會中提出討論云。</p>
<h3>年關酬酢增多　香煙價格飛漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來紙烟價格飛漲，原因可自供需兩方面求得答案。以供給而論，進口許可制度實施後，外烟已爲禁止轍入品，商人有貨在手者，均持觀望居奇之態度。同時日來金價上揚，刺激人心，亦有關係。以需求而言，年關將至，酬酢驟多，本埠外埠之需要突增，故市價看高。本市紙烟產量，據業巾人估計，每月的在二萬箱以上。其中經濟部經營之巾華烟草公司，每月出貨在八千箱左右，據云工潮對於產量，有相當影饗。現悉該公司之年賞問題，勞資雙方原則上已有協議，和解華錄則尚未簽訂。關於外商中台柱之英美烟草公司，因戰時損失頗大，目下開工之機數尚不多。至於駱駝幸運等六種牌子在我　設廠之可能性，記者昨日亦詢之有關人士，據云此事並不簡單，因新牌香烟在我國製造，需先由貨物稅局核准，在目前之情形下是否能准，頗成問題。</p>
<h3>絲織業籌組　產銷聯營公司</h3>
<p>關於絲織業組織特種委員會機構，業經各關係當局數度會商以後，短期內即可實現，此項機構由中　公司·中國銀行·交通銀行·中信局等合組而成，以收買之生絲及人造絲配給各廠代織，第一期以三個月爲限，如成績較好，則續辦第二期，此項原則巳決定，惟實施細則，尚須呈經常局核准後，公佈施行，聞絲織業公會正籌組上海絲織產銷聯營股份有限公司，據該業公會負賣人透露，籌組目的，係在統一外銷機構，並已得當局允准配發原料，日內即可與中央銀行正式簽訂合同，現該會已於昨日發出通知，由各會負廠以目前開工機數之半數爲認股數額，每機每股計法幣二十萬元，一次繳足，將來配發原料時，亦即以該項數額爲標準，並規定於十二月廿三日前填認，否則即作自願放棄論。</p>
<h3>紗市漸有轉機</h3>
<p>昨紗市榮辱互見，配給品二十支草包貨仍有複製品業轉售不懈，然有京蕪等客帮乘廉吸收，益以黃金又創新價，紗市頗有止跌轉漲之象，奈實銷微末，致呈欲昇無力之況，各支成交行情，大致與十九日價相彷。</p>
<h3>處理棉紗方案　由六點擴爲八點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，於昨日下午三時，召開臨時會員大會，到該會各會員廠代表約七八十人，由王啟宇氏主席。席間對政府所提今後處理棉紗方案六點，提付從詳討論，最後決議擴充爲八點，呈由紡管會吳兼主委轉呈宋院長核　。聞如獲批准，即可望於明年一月一日起施行。</p>
<p>又昨日該會臨時動議：爲及時供應各廠原料需要起見，應請紡管會即日在自由購買原則下，允許原棉進口商行，即日裝運原棉來滬·決讓·通遼，向紡管會露　·會議至四時半始散。</p>
<h3>台糖軋缺市緊</h3>
<p>昨合糖以現貨軋缺關係，公會劃盤較爲紊亂，如中砂白及生砂赤均有萬餘元上落，但前日所開廿八期中砂白等爲數達五萬餘包，廿六號可以出貨，或可望平落，五羊粗白劃十七萬六千元，客貨商來四五車白十八萬六千元，汕提　反鬆，開十萬〇一千五百元，潤德青十萬左右至九萬七八千元，成交四五百包，刁靑色紅者仍開十一萬元，三號建冰廿二萬五千元。</p>
<h3>貨主扳抬　茶交稀少</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，出口行雖有進胃，但陳抽珍·陳珍眉等花色，存底將聲，貨主扳抬，結果行情一致進展，至於高檔陳祁開，英商仁記洋行，亦有意收買，惜供售者鮮，交易遂未明則，其他花色，過程無何變卦，至於紅綠茶內銷，本街及客滯呆加故。</p>
<p>據茶業界稱，印度錫蘭及爪哇，所產之紅茶，在歷年改進下，出品趨佳佳佳，且自明年一月一日起，有滬業統制，恢復自由買賣之說，　問某英荘洋行業已向錫蘭方面訂購二萬萬磅，俾資裝運歐洲各　云。</p>
<h3>國內滙款統計</h3>
<p>頃　：郵政儲金匯業局上海分局方面統計，最近兩月來匯款數額，由內地匯滬均較由滬匯內地者爲多，如十月份內地　滬匯款爲一百五十餘億元，匯至內地者僅十六億元，十一月份由內地匯滬匯款爲二百五十餘億元，較之十月份又增一百億元，匯至內地者僅十二億元，較之十月份又减少四億元。</p>
<h3>日本貨　死灰復燃　又將來滬傾銷</h3>
<p>自委帥當局准許日本恢復自由貿易後，，業有日本白報紙已運抵滬上傾銷·茲悉另有日本棉紗玩具鐘表自由車及化學用品等，亦經准許出口，除向南洋市塲拓展外，即將陸續運華銷售，一部份傳已候愉來滬，際此美貨泛濫聲中，日貨又來競銷，不特威脅我垂危之工商界，更不帝爲我國戰勝之恥辱云。</p>

<h3>大專足球聯賽　復旦滬江重賽二比二成和局　復旦健將缺席影響實力　滬江先盛獲衰迫成平手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大專足球聯賽，復旦滬江，昨日下午在的翰球塲重賽，裁判莊逸凱，巡邊員諸德輝·陳之剛，雙方啦啦隊各百餘人到塲助威，復旦先鋒任家桂，因前日與環球體育會足球隊友誼賽時，傷足趾，未能參戰，後衛健將王和生亦未登塲，故攻勢雖強，然至緊要關頭，常有攻虧一　之勢，實爲美中不足。滬江，昨日幸運異常，甚多意外之精彩表演，全隊因得置賽機會，踢來格外賣力。故貧以二比〇佔先，然終受不住復風巧妙迅速之攻勢，只得平分天下，結果二比二，上半時零比零未開紀錄。</p>
<p>雙方混戰示開記錄</p>
<p>笛聲饗處，角逐江首得角球，鄭德耀飛起一頂，雖未開花，却嚇得復旦急起振作，球遂常在滬江門前旋轉，王定球心猿意馬，首射太高，再射更高。范嗣傑高球傳中，何明壁一蹴又偏，錢家駒三發角球，然未識天時，均爲風吹落塲外。范嗣傑兩蹴角球，奈以高度不足，都在巾途，爲人擴去，復且攻勢極猛，射門機會亦多，球運不佳，終無所獲，實爲可惜，上半時乃以零對零結束。</p>
<p>天時地利滬江運中</p>
<p>易陣再戰，滬江順風送球，居高臨下，利用天時地利，（約翰球塲南低北高，時北風正急），不出五分鐘時，涂必毅高球飛中，吳敬仁一蹴命中，首建奇功·緊接復旦後衛界內犯手球，滬江由隊長鄭德耀主射，又告鵠巾一球，滬江遂以二比〇佔絕對優勢。滬江啦啦隊應笛聲而起。米幾滬江陳葆根腿部抽筋倒地不起，爲人抬出。滬江鬥將張孚琪傷指，趙堯章調上。</p>
<p>乘機突起復旦報復</p>
<p>復旦乘機突起，滬江門前混戰一塲，項霸得機輕越撥入一球，復旦氣勢乃盛。後王定球得一十二碼球，惜求勝心太切，脚頭稍重，球由門上飛出·未幾錢家駒帶球沿邊直進，突橫掃門前，適球將一洛未落之際，范嗣傑驚腰轉身，一頭頂個正着，直刺網心，建立一功，雙方遂以二比二成爲平局。范嗣傑爲眾戰友擁抱歸陣，情形至爲興奮而熱烈。此後復旦攻勢益緊，幾度滬江門前混戰，奈滬江球門，一再幸運，化險爲夷。此時複旦項　有一極精彩之演出，即倒身由頂上鈎射，惜徵高碰門　彈回，時間旣屆，雙方遂以二比二平分秋色。</p>

<h3>新海軍的搖籃</h3>
<p>— 本報青島特派員杭舟</p>
<p>青島十八日航訊</p>
<p>北起遼東半島，南迄海兩島，中經渤海，黃海，東海，南海，　　遼寗，河北，山東，江蘇，浙江，福建，廣東七省的我國海防綫，在此以武力爲生存要棄之時代中，當抗戰以前，用以防衛的海軍總噸數是四萬四千餘噸，約等於一艘主力艦的噸數；至抗戰發生，即首遭敵所　毀。</p>
<p>然而，新海軍到今天也已經滿了一週歲！</p>
<p>新的基礎</p>
<p>「東負勞山，面臨黃海，西抱膠州灣」，這形勢，說明靑品是一個卓越的海軍茲地。縣美第七艦隊司令柯克上將的說法：「靑島港口之儀良，爲遠東第一。」在幽靜而雅美的海陽路上，迎着海風，徐步前行，一行驚心怵目的標語映入眼簾：「無海防即無國防！」寫道標語的國牆裏面，有一拼鑒齊宏偉的建築。這兒便是中國新海軍的搖籃·或者說是：「中國海軍的黃埔」——中央海軍訓練團的所在地。</p>
<p>當美國泱以剩餘軍艦二七一艘贈送我國，作爲新海軍的基礎後，發生了一個嚴重的問題：「誰去接收·管理，使用這許多軍艦？」那時，蔣主席在重慶舉失第七艦隊前任司令巴貝中將洽談後，孕育了中央海軍訓練團的種子，至十二月廿之日正式成立、派研習海軍極有心得的，曾任我駐美海軍武官及軍政部海軍處處長的海軍上校林祥光任主任；海軍中校陳贊湯爲副。</p>
<p>海訓訓訓團雖冠以一中央」兩字，實際上是巾美合辦的。美第七艦隊爲此特地糾織了一惆「中國兩棲部隊訓練團」，他們簡稱之爲「Ｃ·Ａ·Ｔ·Ｇ·」，協同負責訓練事宜，不過，對外則用「顧問國」的名義·以戚丁上校爲首席顧問，希布來上校副之。下下下設訓練課，軍醫課，軍需課，人事室，交通股，管理股等。共有官二十餘人，兵六十餘人。薪餉係美方自給。</p>
<p>訓練方式</p>
<p>一切訓練所需的器材和設備，百分之九十九皆由美方供給，總值違法幣一百億元。我們配合的建設，尚不及億元，一年來，中央撥發的經費亦不過五·六億一元。</p>
<p>由成立海訓團的任務決定訓練的方式，這是一種仿照美國戰時緊急訓練的方式，正如海訓團所喊出的兩句口號：「即訓即練，即練即用。學員均係海軍總司令部遴送前來，大都已自海軍軍官學校學業，受過一番基本的關於知識上的教育，再授以最新的使用技衛，使在短期內即能服務海上。</p>
<p>陸訓階段</p>
<p>訓練分「陸訓」，「艦訓」兩階段。「陸調」設各專門訓練班，有航海輪機·槍砲·船藝·電機·信號·電訊·霄達·電羅經·砲火指揮·修理小型船艇，機械等班。使每一學負自模型，圖表，教育電影及教官的講解中究瞭解各種技術的使用，俾進至「艦訓」階段能駕輕就熱。這期間的需十二個星期至廿個星期。</p>
<p>艦艇訓練</p>
<p>「陸訓」完畢，開始實際的艦艇訓練。這一時期很短，的六個混期至八個星期。受訓期滿，做着海的夢，夢着有一天穿起美麗的海軍制服的大孩子們，便實現了他們的理想，成爲一名合格的海軍，服務於他們受訓的那條艦艇上，生活緊緊地和海運緊在一起。</p>
<p>「五十與五十之比」——廿五歲的槍砲教官慮振乾說：「中美雙方相等的負責訓練。每星期一舉行中美聯席會義，次討論訓練進度。每星期六舉行中英聯合檢閱一次。同時，每週週未舉行考試一次·」海訓團另設有政治部，負賣調育事宜，主特人是會任政治部第三應副廳長的陸軍少將陶灌亞。</p>
<p>受訓軍官</p>
<p>詔光易過，一年了。舉業的已有六期，共計軍官二百名，士兵二千名，接收美贈艦廿七艘，的六萬一千餘噸，已超過我國戰前海軍總噸數一萬七千餘噸此等艦艇均已先後編隊服役，巡戈於全中國海面。在遙遠的西沙，南沙，團沙諸羣烏海面，亦可發現宅們的影踪。</p>
<p>尚在受訓的有軍官一百名，士兵五百名。這是第七期了。</p>
<p>此外，海訓團另設有三個訓練班：（一）軍需班：造就軍需人材。（二）軍官補訓班：士兵提升爲軍官者關回訓練。（三）見習官訓練班：海軍軍官學校剛畢業的一批學生在此受訓。</p>
<p>教室一瞥</p>
<p>盧振乾領導記者參觀各個教室。在美國的活動房屋中，未來的海軍們正在孜孜的學習着，這是信號，這是電機，這是雷達……軍事是一切科學的總匯，而在海軍方面尤其如此，「在廣博的海軍學識和技術中，他們或許尚正是一批小學生呢！」我這樣想：「但已經是難能可貴的了！」</p>
<p>我門走到一　軍艦上。這是一條四千　噸的組克登陸艦，曾參加菲律賓之戰戰，受過傷，業經我才養收，現在　名「中調」，供「　訓」之用。我參觀每一部門，立　　，跳望浩渺的海　。我　　入一種夢境，我夢想到有一天，這廣闊的海面上都是　　靑天白日滿地紅旗戰的軍艦！但我立刻爲自己的想頭感到一種沉重的負担！　上的一位同志指着雷達機告訴我：「用這個機件，可以偵察到前來的飛機是英國的？蘇聯的？日本的？……這是一種秘密！美國人沒有教給我們！」他說着，自巴感覺寒傖地笑了。</p>
<p>生活情調</p>
<p>海軍的生活是比較富於情趣的。在受訓訓訓時除八小時的課程外，舉員們得到充分的娛樂機會。他們組織有一個俱樂部，設備頗完全，每星期放映三次電影。先前還有週末跳舞會，或許是覺得奢侈了一點吧，後來取消了。在薪餉方面，海軍較高於陸軍一級。即一個海軍中尉相等於陸軍上尉的待遇。在海上服務時，另有津站，的合薪餉十分之六。</p>
<p>一年了，真不容易！本月廿二日是海訓團成立的一週年紀念。在這混亂的一年中，海軍方面有了這點基礎，不亦是聊可自慰的麼？　然，這個貧血的嬰兒，　着美國的「牛奶」穿着美式的「服裝」玩美國的「玩具」，還是那麼瘦小，　單接收美國二七一艘　餘軍艦的官兵訓練，還不知要化多少心血，歷多少時間，（目前是第一階段，只接收登陸艦，逐後接收補給艦，巡洋艦等等）；但我們想到黃埔在那個初創的時期，不也是像一支弱小的幼苗嗎？而後來，成爲了中國新軍的中堅！現在我們祝福它——中國新海軍，壯大起來！</p>

<h3>榮歸曲</h3>
<p>— 田漢</p>
<p>江山沒有改，人心也還在。</p>
<p>聽，這一片歡呼，這萬聲喝彩！</p>
<p>可憐，我們苦守了八年，才得這大地春回，這一個再見了爹娘，那一個重逢了姊妹，這一個吻着了他的妻子，那一個擁抱着失散多年的他的小孩！好，哭吧！這眼淚是甜的，笑吧！這幸福對我們是十分應該。</p>
<p>舞吧！挺起了胸懷，頭起了舞鞋，醉吧！舞起了金杯，紅透了桃腮。</p>
<p>祗是，天哪！怎麼勝利成了災，我，我也是個規矩的孩子啊·</p>
<p>却被勝利拋在長街，爲着養活我的娘，我不能不把舞腰來賣，我得川滿臉的歡笑，掩藏我滿肚子的悲哀。</p>
<p>你——你們的爸爸都回來了，我，我的爸爸怎麼不見回來？</p>
<p>編者按：「榮歸曲」係中電二廠新片（顧而已編劇趙丹導演）「衣錦榮歸」中之主題歌。</p>
<h3>評「魂斷藍橋」</h3>
<p>— 一飛</p>
<p>「魂斷藍橋」不僅是一部描寫偉大的愛情的作品；在闡發同性間純潔高尚的友誼，提倡人類的節操觀念，都有其不同的價值。</p>
<p>故事的自然，是很佔使宜的。雙方處於極不自由的環境裏，哀綿的慘劇，便很易的發生了。戰爭時期的軍人，身體不能由己，勞合考寗因了突然的調防，誤了婚期，再以殉難的消息誤傳，竟使勞母瑪拉之間發生誤會，造成瑪拉被迫爲妓，無顏再見勞合考寗，而因此自殺，使一件極美滿的婚姻，便爾慘破。</p>
<p>這　，作者第一個成功，在於描寫少女初戀時的心理極爲深刻。勞合考寗在雨中等候，當瑪拉看到後，急忙趕晤，是最完善的幾個鏡頭。這裏，告訴出靑年的男子，渴望有個可愛的女友，而靑春時期的少女對於她的男友也有得極其重要的。</p>
<p>其决，作者寫兩個同樣遭遇的人之間互相照顧友愛的一些，甚足動人。瑪拉和凱蒂，都是苦命的歌舞女郎，她們兩個人，互相親愛，至情的流露，在在都能　化動人，而覺得友誼的偉大，有時會超過一切。</p>
<p>導演也利利利川許多很優美的技巧。「倒裝」雖然祗是一個極普通的方法，可是在回回回憶的時候，用臘中的對象的談話作爲引子和收尾，就提高了原原原原來的那種技巧的水準了。</p>
<p>其他，輕鬆有趣的鏡頭也很多，當勞合考寗求婚得遂，往求上級的允許的時候，出入大門數次，門　敬體不迭，頗足發笑；而連對方名姓都米問淸，更爲　默了。此外，如問答話的重覆等，不但足以更深刻地現出小兒女的　態，抑且對於悲劇中的枯滯性，減失了許多。導演最後一個手法——瑪拉的自殺，延長時間，增加了緊急和恐怖，它的功用，甚至於使走出戲院的觀眾，看到路上的行車，有些寒斯斯地害怕呢！</p>
<p>無庸否認的，演員的演技都是非常的優秀，費　麗在內心的表現，尤其通偵，她的哭！傷心，不近在面部，其他各部分，都有　充分的　托。勞勃泰勒在動作和面部的表情方面，都極其優越，他是一個可愛的軍人。佛琴妮費兒特演瑪拉之女友凱蒂，確能把她友愛的成分，更變得深整，她的演技是特出的！</p>
<p>最後，我敢這樣說：這部片子的成功，一部分還是由於攝的黑白片的緣故，假石換了五彩，那就要遜色得多呢了！你說是不？</p>
<h3>我看聖城記</h3>
<p>— 朱雷</p>
<p>應該說，「聖城記」在國產片中是值得推關的一張。</p>
<p>牠成功的地方是：（一）鏡頭明晰，外景優良，如開塲時介紹幾個風土人情鏡頭，金神父獨行鏡頭，白楊在岸上追趕船只的鏡頭，處處可以看出導演和攝影師的精心　劃，畫面的精緻處可以比美日本電影，純粹站在藝術立塲說，日片對攝影的光度是素以淸麗明晰見長的，（二）對金神父這個角色的創造有獨到成功處，當然，這點優越的成績大半是謝添一個人的力量，他的不溫不火沉着　老到的演技，他的西洋式的國語對白，他的化裝和他熟練的英語對白，都是說來容易，却決非一個普通的演員可以輕易嘗試的。（三）塲面意境的深邃，也具見導演的舖排苦心，如白楊受了調虎離山計以後，深覺有負神父重託，就英勇地站立在自已的國旗下進備爲國犧牲的情眾，如金神父在片末起草「告愛好自由和平人士書」一段，　風怒號，雷電交熾，滿身）　歲的泥將，滿身激昂的情緒，槍聲中倒下地時，用最後的力量寫完「中國萬歲」幾個字的情景，如神父在教堂中收留全村的居民以後，看着他們辛勸操作的精神，臉上浮起了一個愉快的微笑，在人羣中牙來穿去，一聲輕輕的問好，一點對嬰兒的引返，都能引起觀眾的無限溫情，這裏淸楚地表現了中華民族。對環境的適應性，對生活的堅靭性，誇張一點說，這就是證明爲什麼暴虐的敵人不能征服　個頑強神神神秘的古國的原由。</p>
<p>當然，天下難得有十全十美的藝術品，本片的劣點也有：（一）我覺到中國電影又一個普遍的毛病，本片也不能例外，就是「間歇」，（二）剪接欠佳，有的鐘頭長達八九分鐘，有的只在銀幕上漏一　　，這是長度上的不夠勻和，有如片首金神父幫助推車一場戲，也許導演是有着一種象徵心理的緣故，鏡頭連換十多個，却拍來拍去始終是這塲戲，片中白楊和飾羅大軍的齊衡都是一等　員，二個人的戲卻安排的那么少，（三）對白浮俗，還不脫早期「口號」式作風，難得有一句精練動聰的，以致對演員的表情，動作都發生了影響。（英語除外）</p>
<p>最後，來個總評，「聖城記」是國產片中己經超脫了舊時代那些定型的風格，正走向新時代新　風精的一部正在脫變過程中的成功作。</p>
<h3>平劇瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>程硯秋的不敗</p>
<p>梅程這一次對台下來，在售票的總數上是程勝，然在賣座的成數上是程敗，而而而而且梅每天上座平均得很，程則不然忽視而客滿，忽而七成，無穩定狀態；從這種我們看出梅的觀眾是一般性的，程的觀眾範圍比較狹窄，看梅蘭芳祗要梅蘭芳上台便行，看程硯秋則要論論他的戲碼。</p>
<p>程硯秋與梅蘭芳力之戰，實在是以逸代勞（梅蘭芳已南京，美琪，皇后，三期下來，且程硯秋登台之期梅蘭芳己在中國演唱多日），宜乎可勝，現在所以未勝者，實於觀眾方面尚敵不過梅蘭芳之普遍化也。</p>
<p>然而以這次成績而言，程硯秋雖未勝，但亦不敗；從程硯秋一方面來說，實可稱爲滿意。但若對台久久延長，非但兩敗俱傷，恐程硯秋須再隔一長時期方能重來上海登台也。否則非天天貼重頭戲，不足以呌座。</p>
<p>譚富英的倒霉</p>
<p>譚富英，楊　森好像都替　生倒了霉，從此四大　生不及梅程；雖然譚富英在天蟾會以「戰太平一列過一次大軸（程硯秋玉堂春的壓軸），但是亦僅一次而已，如今程硯秋已臨別在即，想必他再無大軸機會。那天「戰太平之夕」我在座，賣座並非不佳，幾近客滿，或已客滿·，但後來始終未列大軸者，猜想上去，程硯秋不肯大有關係；其所以讓一决者，實礙於延請譚富英時之所答應之條件也。</p>
<p>譚富英在天儼然二牌姿態。同時也有與葉盛蘭並二牌的嫌疑，至少葉盛蘭是二牌半，不是三脾，因爲葉的「鎮　州」曾漏在譚的前面。但是譚富英老因有葉盛蘭同台的緣故老陪着唱「黃鶴樓」，「羣英會」，「八犬鎚，斷臂說書」，「甘露寺」等都不是他的拿手戲。尤其是近來譚富英的說白大大退步，所以「黃鶴樓」「羣英會」，「斷臂說書」可說他最不拿手的戲碼。</p>
<p>譚富英在天蟾以唱「不拿手戲」的時候比唱「拿手戲」的時候爲多。</p>
<p>譚富英可說是倒了霉。</p>
<p>但是他這次倒霉可以說是自食其果，誰呌他在皇后時期賣一萬八？要是他賣一萬二，我相信梅蘭芳程硯秋今天賣二萬，人家不會說他們票價便宜或是不責。也許他們到今天不會掛二萬，就是掛了二萬，也許不會像今天那樣賣座。</p>
<p>楊寶森的減色</p>
<p>楊賽森在梅蘭芳處，只聽得梅蘭芳，很少聽得去聽楊寳森，儘管楊　森天天漏着正工好戲，人家對他的戲碼很少研究。</p>
<p>「奇冤報」「空城計」是楊寳森的拿手戲，但是很少爲了他的這兩齣戲，而作爲大家茶餘酒後的京戲談話資料。一文昭關」是他最動聽的一齣好戲，也許是當今的「絕唱」，但是始終未曾唱過。</p>
<p>楊寶森以前在上海也是當然頭牌，也　賣過好幾次滿　舟，但是他的觀眾到今天爲什麼不　　？</p>
<p>但是他比譚富英好多了，至少在　　可以如意。</p>
<p>又　不是楊　森的倒霉？</p>
<p>大凡名利難以兼收，據說譯富英與楊寳森「利」的方面都不壞，「譚楊事件」豈長又一佐證？</p>
<p>王少樓的悲哀</p>
<p>王少樓，上次他負盛譽而去，這次他是毀譽歸來，因爲在這幾年之中已倒了　十，在北平潦倒得很，在廣德樓唱着機關佈景，頭頂電燈泡的速台本戲「八仙得道一，而且還不受人歡迎。在天　這一回，他遲遲來到，來了以後又好幾天沒派他的戲碼，第一次派他是薛平貴王寳釧中演「銀空山」的平貴，臨時他不貨上，因爲這是裏十活的角色，第一天演太貶身份，乃臨時由老牌裏子老生張春彥上去。</p>
<p>王少樓到底好不好。於是沒人知道，看他牌子高高的在袁世海之上。雖然程硯秋的面情也有關係，但是似乎應該不是頂壞，誰知道他來上海唱戲百分之百全是程硯秋之面子。</p>
<p>他正式第一次漏面是「　　會」由他唱魯肅，譚富英唱際風，後來他魯肅也唱不成了，兩次以後無代價的「頂」給了譚富英；他另一餉戲「甘露寺」的　玄魯肅，很多人以爲他可以唱到底的，因爲譚寫英是不肯唱那二角的，誰知這到臨到三天之巾還不饒恕也，喬玄魯肅又無條件的讓給了已經被天蟾丟在字紙　裏的宋玉聲。「賀后　殿」在程硯秋一向是正工老生配的，左算右算，就應該他扮了趙匡義坐到高台上去，但是不知怎的，程硯秋也打破了以往紀錄，讓裏子老生李世霖爬了上去。</p>
<p>所留下的祗有「紅拂傳」的李靖，他還沒有出頂，可是看上去。程硯秋在臨別也不想再動那　戲了。王少樓這次登台，高喊無嗓，低着頭，很像怕羞的樣子，我想大概與「掛了高牌，拿了錢，不能唱戲」很有關係，實在王少樓是有着莫大的悲哀！</p>
<p>麒麟童的固執</p>
<p>麒麟童近幾年來異常固執他總以爲他那三個大字仍有號召；憑他登台，他的包銀必可與任何「巨」角爭高低，但是對於他的配角則儘可能利用「廉價品」所以他每次登台每次都造成一居信芳劇本，麒麟童賺錢」的結果，（周信芳即麒麟童，麒麟童是黃金大戲院的台柱，同時也是黃金戲院的大股東，他在股東立塲是用周信芳眞名的。）</p>
<p>因爲他的理想都是不對的，他的號召力早已大不如前，所以决决都是失敗；但是他固執得很，認定自己絕對不錯，所謂「失敗」乃是「成功之母」於是到今天爲止，他遝把自已當作找救黄金，危同的一貼良藥，最近賣座黃金最慘，就是敗在麒麟童的固執。</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>中國女郎</p>
<p>女主人公楊小姐，只是一個穿上旗袍的外國人而已。好萊塢一再誤解了中國，尤其是中中中國的女他。對於挪威，蘇聯，法蘭西的鬥　他們都拍過影片，惟有有有對於抗戰的中國，好萊塢應該抱歉。「靑天白日滿地紅」「中華萬歲」以致這張「中國女郎」都把美國人誇張爲三頭六臂的無敵英雄，未免抹煞中國人民戰鬥的精神和力量，所以即使編劇立在同情中國的立塲，描寫敵寇殘殺無辜民眾的現實，他仍然不免忽視中國，而有淺薄之　。劇本結構凌亂，沒有中心，編劇根本不知是根據戲名發展中國女郎的故事呢，還是預備表達一個問諜故事，若是側重中國女郎，間　故事旣無迎繫，自可刪去，否則，後段變成　劇，不合間談片的意旨，豈不可笑。在編劇的粗陋的安排下，導演無法可施，雖有片面面面可可可取，不算成功，於是演員也不出色，馬馬虎虎，弄成一張C級片，整張片十，我就記得三點，那是被槍殺的民眾行列列列中，一個老者的一一回首、月光下，對於家國的最後的回顧，慘絕人寰，以及昆明的大轟炸下，學生安坐和情侶逃生的幾幕鏡頭，有如那個印度小小小鬼一樣可愛，險此俱覺浮誇。</p>
<p>胭脂淚</p>
<p>變愛，是女人獨一無二的世界，女人一生的出發一點，就君她愛情的幸福，雖是同胞姊妹，走愛情的路就各自不同，走下去，很少有回頭的日子，想一想　閣裏的綺夢，總是淒凉。「胭脂淚」中有最好的三種典型，一笑一哭都是真實，我們在每一個女性的世界裏可以發現她們的影十，那些淚滴不單是英國女人的，而是爲全地球的女性流出來的。因爲是眞實，這裏有英國片通常少有的冲冲冲淡，有些地方太沖淡了，導演未曾　力，平平地過王了，留不下一片色彩，也短少美國影片冲淡巾的傷惑，斷斷續續，沒有氣氛把它連買起來，在我們的記憶上劃下光痕。惟對人物個性，編劇導演都有深澈的刻劃，甚至過度細徵。演員演技非常穩定，詹姆斯梅遜是英國第一把交椅的男星，一稱冷峭堅強的個性，流露無遺，難怪他在美國大受歡迎，號稱「英國的克拉克蓋博」；斐　絲卡兒佛最近適獲英國演技獎，比之「花開並蒂」，她在這裏又是新的氣質；一一姐的楚楚可憐，三妹美麗近似法國的黛妮兒達麗安，大姐夫的氣派，各有千秋。憑該一提的是孩子們的戲，三妹之女哭哭躲躲，門隙偷窺的一場可說天衣無縫，入木二一分。</p>
<p>魔綱擒王</p>
<p>G－MAN　的偵探片已經落伍了，聰明的觀眾不再歡迎大殺據的塲面，代之而與的是心理學的刺激。「火車謀殺案」和「綠窗艷影」那樣的偵探片，不再是簡單的偵探片，而是高度的戲劇性的作品。「魔網擒王」走的是相等的路，導演很會利用鏡頭，蒙太奇手法應用用用頗多，可是還不能使這張片子變得簡潔流暢，因爲劇本寫得太繁雜，對話過多，故佈疑陣，竟致觀眾無後摸索。一張片十只是一段一段閃爍神秘的寳石片，不乏驚人之處，擊香後的幻象，便是一例。狄克鮑　爾改變作風，老練多矣，「魔網擒王」中只有他一個人可說成功！</p>
<p>福星高照</p>
<p>明星大會串的戲，等於中中中國菜中中中的炒什錦，「星光燦爛」「好萊塢大酒店」以至「福星高照」，都是一例例例的老套故事，根本毫無導演手法編劇意旨可曾，好的壞的作一股腦吞下去，閒來無事趁熱鬧，埃洛苐林，的克卡遜，奧麗機地哈苐蘭的歌舞，倒也可愛，　娜蘇亞是美國獨　歌壇的歌唱播　明星，比珍妮麥唐納還要走紅，聲喉圓潤，名副其實，埃第康迪除被羣狗包圍外，其他太鬧了，有傷大雅。瓊蘭絲蓮的笑醫是最大的收穫，我們對於她總有許多的期望。</p>

<h3>衡陽之憶</h3>
<p>— 成惕軒</p>
<p>衡陽地處衝要，爲用兵所必爭。民國三十三年秋，倭寇進犯，我第十軍方先覺部，與之苦戰四十八日，殺傷過當，卒以彈盡援絕，淪爲犬羊窟宅者經年。是役也，白刃相接，碧血成渠，實足驚天地，泣鬼神，蔚爲抗戰史中壯烈光輝之一頁。今海氛已靖，嶽色重春，衡陽市參議會，請於其地建立紀念城，藉以象徵吾國抵禦外侮之精神，照耀千秋，永垂不朽，意至善也。余因憶及居渝州日，曾爲「憶衡陽」二章，紀述其事；世有編纂抗戰詩史者，倘亦足備甄采之資也歟！詩錄於後（附序）：</p>
<p>自今歲（係指三十三年）重五節後，倭寇雲集大軍，猛犯衡陽，時逾一月；而孤城固守，寸土必爭。蟾魄重生，皎皎見初三之月；鯨氛漸　，青青數七二之峯。川嶽效靈，定殲強虜；河水還我，行奏凱歌。惟是烽火三湘，親朋萬里。寄書不達，念尺鯉於江潭；小立沈吟，望飛鴻於天外。</p>
<p>嶽雲成陣護旌旗，落日孤城動遠思。</p>
<p>萬里訊傳鯨斬未？幾封書寄雁歸遲。</p>
<p>荒郊似聽窮黎泣，劇郡甯容黠虜窺。</p>
<p>七二峯凌天尺五，今宵又見月如眉。</p>
<p>旬日前（係指三十三年七月杪），曾爲憶衡陽一首，念多士登陴之勇，寄孤城落日之思。方看喬嶽參天，正峙熊熊之陣；不謂妖氛蔽野，竟成豺虎之最。窮寇傾巢，何殊一擲；壯夫報國，自有千秋寫爾丹心，付之青史。</p>
<p>孤城經月陷重圍，想見登陴射落暉。</p>
<p>南望賓鴻驚信斷，東來胡馬及秋肥。</p>
<p>千尋雲嶽支天柱，百戰湖湘振國威。</p>
<p>往事睢陽那可擬，纍纍碧血有餘輝。</p>
<h3>漫談女作家—漫步藝林的鳳子</h3>
<p>— 談宜</p>
<p>鳳子姓封—這個姓，江浙一帶似乎很少不見。是的！她不是江浙人，她出生在湖北，負笈在上海，原籍却是廣西。至今桂林還有她的老父和哥哥們（她是老幺）住在那裏。</p>
<p>這不是秘密，因爲今年春間她曾爲奔母親的喪，到過桂林。當時她曾寫過關於桂林的文章，報紙上也載過她去桂林的消息。但，假使你忽略了這段事實，祗聽她一口流利的北方話呢，你將不僅不信她是南國女郎，而且將懷疑她是在上海受的教育呢！</p>
<p>提起鳳子，不免令人聯想到她主演的「白雲故鄉」。因此有人認爲鳳子是電影明星。其實，與其稱她爲電影明星，毋甯說她是話劇演員。因爲她在話劇方面的經騐，實在比電影更多。不僅在最近演過「天國春秋」，在復旦讀書時，便演過曹禺的「雷雨」。後來又去日本演「日出」。抗戰時，在香港，桂林，昆明，最後在重慶，也屢次參加話劇工作。曾寫過一部「舞台漫步」，以散文的筆調，寫出她對話劇的經騐與心得，在重慶新民晚報戲劇週刊連載。</p>
<p>但她在勝利之後第一次回到上海，却是以女記者的姿態，從芷江搭車用飛機直到了南京。而且爲參加受降典禮中的唯一女性。原來那時她已担任了新民報的記者。</p>
<p>不久，外勤不幹了，改充爲和平日報的副刊編輯。後來又担任過京滬三日刊和國民午報的副刊編輯，同時在上海文藝復興，文潮月刊，文藝春秋等各大雜誌上發表作品，不過所發表的以散文爲多。長篇小說，除了正言出版社出版的那部處女作「無聲的歌女」外，還　　　　第二部巨著。</p>
<p>從話劇變爲電影，又從電影變爲女記者，變爲副刊編輯，變爲職　寫作家，似乎變得很快很多。其實，電影也罷，話劇也罷，記者也罷，編輯也罷，以音容動作顯示給觀衆也罷，以生花妙筆刻畫給讀者也罷，她始終在文藝氛圍中生活，始終爲文藝而生活着，工作着。不過表演的方式不同而已。而以她的才藝說，銀幕，舞台，報章，刊物，恰如她自由來去的走廊，優游漫步的草地。她像在鋼琴的鍵盤上跳舞，每一個音階都足以顯露她的天才。正像她日常生活一樣，處處能握住恰當的步位，在生活的尖端上擷取精英。一件事情尚未成熟的時候，即令在她最要好的朋友前面，也決不露一點風聲。當勝利初臨時，大家在奔走交通工具，朋友見面，總是互詢有無辦法，可是她在上汽車去芷江搭飛機之前五分鐘，還沒有告訴朋友，說她已找到門路了。從上海去桂林，也是如此。</p>
<p>有人認爲鳳子的行動有點兒神秘，其實祗是她性格的一部份的表現而已。憑良心說，她倒並沒有存心瞞你。所以，假使我們最近突然聽到鳳子定期去美國了，或者消息到我們耳朵裏時，她的船已過了檀香山，那也不必大驚小怪。</p>
<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 科洛</p>
<p>科洛（J.B.Camille　Corot　1796—1875）十九世紀名風景畫家，與米勒同住於巴比仲村，故史家把他們幾個稱之爲巴比仲派。他非但擅長風景，人像也很著名。他的畫是自然而富有詩意。（獅）</p>
<h3>還鄉詩紀</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>大佛無恙</p>
<p>論故鄉名山，雖然李太白怎樣　稱天　的奇偉，但畢竟離城太遠了，可以說我生下來就沒有到過，據說也並不出奇，平面似的山崗，亂石荒草，「李白夢游處」的碑是有的，終究屬於詩仙的幻想而已。算得上名山的是在城西五里的南明山，山上有「大佛寺」，這的確是浙江的第一個名勝。遊浙東的非得到我們那兒瞻仰一下大佛不可。那大佛的歷史很早了，是五代時候，南明山來了一個云游僧，發願霏岩壁要鑿一個十丈高的石佛，自然，這不是短短「數十寒暑」的人生能夠勝任的，和尚死了，他的徒弟接着鑿，連經過第三代的徒弟，再得到越王錢鏐的百萬貫資助，才成功了這一尊巍然跌坐岩壁間的大石佛。佛頂井般大一個洞，通着窗深的水流，因爲大殿是石板舖的地面，底下全是水。殿門的一副聯，說得很確切「十丈金身開翠壁，千年石罅瀉寒聲」。這樣在夏天，便成了避暑的好地點。</p>
<p>通大佛寺本來是一條山路，直上翠浪亭，然後東折而下，就到達山門。後來張載陽另闢了一條公路，那時他做着浙江省長，他是新昌人，自然要給故鄉的名聲發揚光大的，公路完成，又在寺的對面建造起一連幢的洋房，題着「新社」兩個字，他的字胖而圓，真所謂　窠似的，自己却並不來往，空放着作了邑人遊憇的所在。我還深切記得，小時候差不多說玩就上大佛寺去的，總喜歡揀那山路走。現在，我和宗恩又重來了，這是我還鄉夠快慰的事，是的，我還鄉的計劃，重訪南明山是最主要的一件。</p>
<p>我們出了南門，繞城隄而西，清淺的隄水，還活躍着拿一個瓶子捉小蝦萬的童心，宗恩却告訴我，那邊山頂遺留的敵人哨堡，他是怎樣躭着驚走過這下面的，在福建做縣長時，偷閒歸來省親的那晚。我默然了，他是那麼艱貞而偉大，而我，磨枯了筆頭，一無所成。隄盡就接着山路，是曲折斜上的石磴，旁邊「東嶽廟」的原狀尋不到了，只剩了斷肢的泥像，被掩沒在荒草叢中，山路陡峭起來，經過一處峭壁，相傳羅隱秀才到過這兒！喊它的名就會應的，可見山城的幼稚，連空谷回聲的原理也還不懂。再上就是「翠浪亭」，我們坐了一回，覺着滿肚皮的牢騷，給四圍山林之波洗淨了。</p>
<p>東折而下的石磴很難走，在懸崖的中腰，狹而滑，但山門也到了，颯的一聲，橫盤着的松枝下閃過了一隻松鼠，無邊涯的綠色盪着衣袂，我感到了清快。山門內，米芾題的「南明勝境」石碑的另一面，還有一塊「天柱屹然」的碑，一說是朱子題的，因爲上有「朱子讀書處」，滄浪亭供祀着朱子的像，我們也瞻仰了一下，亭前一副聯很妙：「日月雙輪天地眼，詩書百世聖賢心。」之後，我們到了大佛寺，大佛無恙，可是金身黯淡多了。</p>
<p>橫松掠影見鼷鼠，</p>
<p>峭壁回聲呼秀才；</p>
<p>翠浪亭前山似劍，</p>
<p>滿胸柴棘暫爲開。</p>
<p>屹然分作擎天柱，</p>
<p>唱罷滄浪勒石題；</p>
<p>法眼儒心共千古，</p>
<p>南明山上聽鳥啼！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血129</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>從圓子的探索，普通國內和國際的機要文件，都在這書房內，存有副本檔案。至於「七封秘緘」，自從她受命後，在這天上午，幾小時內，機會湊巧，她又再度冒險襲入書房裏，搜索之後，斷定準在地下室內收藏着。到底是正本，或是副本，或是正副本都在這裏，却不知道。</p>
<p>爲何不索性冒險到地下室去探尋一番呢？這却辦不到，不只時限關係，乃因這地下室，僅有一個入口，也許還有雷汽消息「機關」，除了近衛本人外，就連那管理書房的幾名機要侍妾，據說都不曾下去過，呌圓子一人，如何進得去？</p>
<p>那麼，如何斷定這「七封秘緘」必定藏在這個地下室中呢？這倒不是圓子的幻想或揣測，乃根據平日與那幾名機要侍妾，談話的機　中，推解出來的。在高級特務訓練的方式中，就有推索理解的一門功課；凡是不能親身踏勘的所在，要探索其中的秘密內容，全靠推解的機械方式來臆測，就如算術或化學分析方式一般，探求到一個未知數，只有從已知的幾點去追索；探求一個未知元素，就要用已知的幾種反應試劑去分析。這種辦法，雖不能說百分之百可靠，九十九分是站得住的。國際大間諜，專靠火車往來的時間，次數，和速率，就可估計運兵運軍火的數目，和作戰的目標，動向，等等，就是這個辦法之一。</p>
<p>鶴見在汽車裏，聽了野豬把圓子的工作，報告完畢之後，又問明了幾個要點，對於探索「七封秘緘」的計劃，在心下已擬就了一個輪廓，只等到了東京，同幾個得利手下一斟酌，就得宣佈進行了。</p>
<p>話雖說得這般簡易，事實上却有十二萬分的困難：第一，這件工作的性質，異常脆弱；就像在二噸重的大炸彈裏，抽出那隻一碰就炸的信管一般，一個不當心，全局俱燬。所謂脆弱的一點，乃要在人不知鬼不覺的條件下，把這件工作辦好；旣不能把原封拿走，又要不留挪動過的痕跡，否則在「秘緘」未曾揭露之前，這些魔王，早已設法泯跡，或弄出其他對策，把「秘緘」的秘密性移動，致使國際上支持正義的幾根擎天柱石，和一般民衆，恍惚迷離，疑信參半，那時縱令揭露出來，也毫無效果，等於白費。</p>
<p>第二，鶴見雖說主持這件工作，却不能露面，換句話說，只許成功，而不能敗露；因他幹了這事之後，還要維持他現在這樣的有利地位，一直工作下去，直到戰魔們的計劃，完全打碎，世界的戰禍，完全熄滅爲止。所以這件事，必要　到神鬼不覺，才算成功。</p>
<p>事情的性質，如此脆弱，當然不能像其他間諜，盜取秘密文件圖樣那樣，可以強取蠻幹，可以一走了事。同時還要想到，這東西放在這　嚴密所在，必有幾重防護，不消說得：放在台面上的，有別府的衛隊，有專司監護的機要侍妾。這些機要侍妾，雖說玉貌柔質，却小覷不得；就拿圓子打比，不僅靈　機警，並且能夠使刀動槍，都是千中選百，百中選一，物色得來的厲害脚色，否則近衛豈肯把她們放在這樣重要職守上？</p>

<h3>車</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一輛「別古牌」汽車，要賣二十條，連小刑的「飛埃特」也要八條，汽車階級，在今日的身分自是不同。</p>
<p>有個朋友發牢騷說：余豈甘養晦哉，出門無車耳，於是他列舉理由：比如開會完畢，走出大門，別人威風凜凜地一站，「福特」咧，「順風」咧，「克實斯勒咧，從遠處滑來，有時甚至還有個把保鑣侍衛之　的彪形大漢在開專門，他們或者慢條斯理，氣慨軒昂地跨進去，或者向你客氣一下：「一道走罷」？「坐我的車子去罷」？不由人會興「有爲者亦若是」的念頭。即使天雨路滑，活該淋濕，不是三輪軍上受風，就得在電車上出汗。</p>
<p>至於看朋友，江灣路，大西路，徐家匯，天南地北，又不是飛毛腿，還是省省算了罷。</p>
<p>期友的話確有至理，在上海灘沒有一輛汽車，是做不出世面來的。人們說，馬路上到處是黃金，也得走出來才有檢拾的機會，可是跑腿的朋友怎能比汽東階級撿拾的機會更多哩！</p>
<h3>小偷兒吞錶　大員們吞金</h3>
<p>— 賈學甄</p>
<p>同樣是吞，吞法不同</p>
<p>十六日本報，有一則本市新聞，說一個到鐘錶店裏偷錶的小偷，把它吞在嘴裏，險些一被含混過去；後來，經不起警士在他的頰上一摑，於是終於吐出了贓物人贓兩獲。</p>
<p>這一則新聞使我惑覺到上海的小偷，技術的進步確乎稱得上神乎其技了，但我總還覺得這位小倫棋差一籌：錢雖小，但到底是難以下嚥的東西，惟有金，那纔如意呢，嘴裏含不住，索性咕嚕把它吞下，僥倖的話，第二天從大便裏拾起，依舊還可以受用。大概他也總怕萬一不幸，會送走這條老命，所以寗可拿錶來做工夫，却不願與生命開玩笑；其實這正是祀憂，你看多少專門吞金條的大員們，他們今日還不是一樣在吞嗎？</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，他們的技術倒確是小倫們不能望其項背的。即使他們滿嘴被塞了黃金，但仍舊還能講得一口很動聽很不露痕跡的高論·所以他們保得住沒有吞下去致死的危險；同時警士們的手掌，根本也不會光顧到他們的兩　，他們是旣無生命之危，又無倒楣之憂，於是吞金的大員們萬歲！</p>
<p>但有人問我，要是有一天，大員們　的迫不得已的把金吞下去了，那怎麼辦呢？大概也總有藥可解的吧，我想。據說有一種　——也是黃金做成的—可以使吞下的金隨着大便出來，保無性命之憂，並口大便中的黃金，雖然　臭　氣四溢，但仍然可以供他們吃大菜，造洋房……</p>
<p>士們，　壯點，高抬你們的貴手向這些大員們的兩頰也摑一下吧　他們會立刻張開血盆似的大嘴黃澄澄泄滿一地的！</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>可敬的老人　南開校長張伯苓</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>有着高高的身材，紫棠色的臉兒，灰白的平頂頭，架着一副　眼鏡，　了一根手杖，典型的「天津大肚子」我們這位張伯苓光生，從美國回來了。雖然已是七十多歲的年紀但仍有　「燕趙壯士」之風。</p>
<p>張先生是舊式婚姻的信徒，他說過：『新式太六，虛榮心比什麼理論，她們只知道埋了頭做，但是比能說能寫而不會做的好得多，而且新式婚姻離婚很容易，一有不合，各自分飛，不比舊式婚姻的「此路不通」，只好大家讓一步，那不是就沒有事了麼？』</p>
<p>事實上，張先生便是在「身體力行」着的，他和夫人王淑貞女士，向來是有名的模範夫妻·民國二十四年，南開校友曾盛會慶祝張校長結婚四十週祀念。因爲離「金婚」走十年，張先生就自稱爲「鍍金婚」據他自己說：他和夫人從沒有吵過一回架，他的事業，都是他這位不識字的夫人帮助成功的。他稱他夫人呌「喂！」。</p>
<p>張氏的剛毅精神，係受先天遺傳。他父親是天津一介寒儒，發彈琵琶，號稱「琵琶張」。其胞弟彭春，是提倡中國話劇最力的一人。</p>
<p>張先生小時在北洋水師學堂讀書，立志當個海上英雄。後來覺得中國的民族智識淺陋，身體壞，決定隶海軍而就教育。淸末嚴範孫在天津設立了一個私塾，請張先生擔任理化英數等科教授，那個私塾，便成了今日有名的南開大學的　型。</p>
<p>南開剛開辦的時候，學生不過七十餘人，然而在張先生慘淡經營下，學校事業漸次發展，由私熟發展成小學，中學，女中，大學，以及研究院。創校至今，不知造就了多少人材。</p>
<p>在南開的時候，每天早晨六時起來，　　學校散步，計劉着怎樣改進學校。他不善詞令，但是說話親切樸實。他常常說着這句話：「南開的特長是長，長，長，老是在長！」</p>
<p>張光生對政治一向抱着「道不行，乘桴浮於海」的超然態度，不熱心，不參加。但是抗戰時，他毅然地領導了他的學生，踏入了抗建的大時代，他被推爲國民參政會的副議長，他能忍勞耐怨，始終的苦幹，實幹，硬幹！</p>
<p>他的畢生致力教育事業，只問耕耘，不問收穫，不懈不撓，神采奕奕，使我們覺得：張伯苓先生是愈來態年靑了！</p>
<h3>急景凋年</h3>
<p>— 罔悟</p>
<p>甲販：急景凋年，做甚麽生意好？</p>
<p>乙販：我看還是賣粗蔴繩，DDT。來沙而……</p>
<p>甲販：這是甚麼意思？</p>
<p>乙販：讓大家方便呀！</p>
<h3>戰前存款</h3>
<p>— 蔡</p>
<p>銀行不理存款，並非是倒閉了而不理存款，卻是不理抗戰以前的存款。</p>
<p>提起這家銀行不是起碼銀行，在杭州也可算「信用卓著」？的一家了，開設在　橋馬路上，而且自建洋房，相當富麗，即「浙江商業儲蓄銀行」是也。</p>
<p>抗戰前，筆者省吃儉用按月存人三十元所謂「定期存款」，這樣從未間斷的存了五年，突發動抗戰了，在這五年中，因維持存款信用起見，有時沒錢往存時，即舉　取　衣服，總而言之，湊凑拼拼的在進去的，從沒有遲延過一天，所希望者無非是一筆微乎其微的利息而已。</p>
<p>八、三後，該行即席捲一空而　逃避至金華，轉入中溪，可以說未　絲毫損害，即杭州之行址，依然完整，故勝利之初，得先問業復業，迄今巳一年四四四月。</p>
<p>該「浙江商業儲蓄銀行」對抗戰前之存款，迄今猶無淸理表示，筆者親自前往詢問數次，每决輒問非所答。最近據答「以後再說」。以後是遙搖無期，一千年，一萬年，乾脆的「不還」了吧。</p>
<p>筆者的親朋，皆係該行之「存戶」，惟因存款數字，目前聽起來，似乎極渺小，要是打官司，老實說也犯不　；不過，就此算了吧，那，朱免太便宜了這　大銀行了，恐怕像我這樣的存戶有不計其數呢。</p>
<p>星期雜談</p>
<h3>婆媳之間（下）　集體意見</h3>
<p>婚姻革命</p>
<p>「男婚女嫁」，具有數千年歷史的傳統婚姻制度，當然難以改變，可是假使能顚倒一下，一定可以減少家庭間百分之九十幾的無調糾紛。</p>
<p>怎樣改變呢？便是把「嫁女兒」掉　爲「嫁兒子」，把「娶媳婦」颠倒作「娶女婿」。</p>
<p>女兒留在家裏，到了結婚年齡，便替她娶個丈夫回來，兒子到了成年，便把　嫁到老婆家去。這樣，自己母女在一起生活，自然情投意合，不會輕易發生像婆媳間的創傷，裂痕。一個女兒兒兒兒兒的，固然決無問題，即使有三姊四妹，也無關係，因爲同胞姊妹，一切志趣脾氣，總是大同小異，比之異姓的姑嫂，妯娌，婆媳，自然容易性情投合，不生　忌，加之　在司胞骨肉的份上，便能互相合作，互相諒解，家庭間自然融融洽洽了。</p>
<p>至於丈母總是愛女婿的，而且男于總是在外營生的多，在家的時間少，久別暫居，丈母與女婿富然倍覺親熱，如果有三五聯襟，也因爲各人在外的時間多，聚會的時間少，逢年新年佳節，一同返里相聚，那久別相逢，自然倍益親切，決不會像妯娌們成天生活在一起的　爭　　，不能相容</p>
<p>丈母家有兒子的話，成了年的當然嫁出去，還是幼年蹲在家裏的，同姊姊在一起，自然可無話說，同姊夫又因爲不時刻相見，便也就親愛和睦了。</p>
<p>這樣，無所謂婆她，姑嫂，妯娌，於是家庭間皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>這一個改變婚姻制度的荒繆（？）理想，不知道會有人贊同嗎嗎嗎？（易金）</p>
<p>我底婆婆</p>
<p>我的婆婆，年近六十，是一個慈祥可親的人。平日待人接物，不論是鄰居，或者親友，非常的和氣。我和她十分融治，她很體諒我，在家事操作繁忙的時候，總是從旁協助，我呢，想到她老人家年紀大，不宜過份辛勞，一切家事，大都由我搶在前而面辦好。</p>
<p>我始終沒有忘記五年前結婚的那一天，外子對我說的話：「琪妹！我的家就是你的家，孝順我的母親，等於敬重我，養見防老，積　防　，家裏的事，拜託你，有了你，我可以安心，沒有內　之　了。」</p>
<p>我的婆婆，篤信佛教，每逢陰歷初一，月半，焚香，燃燭，吃素，唸佛……是她的例行公事。推測她的本意，無非祈求神佛，降賜福祉，希望全家老小，永保康寗，萬事吉順順順。信仰宗教，各有自由，不過她似乎過份一些，跡近迷信。在家庭中，無論何人，生了病，看她很是焦急，一二天寒熟不退，就要買了長錠化，她說病者碰到了「赤老」—指鬼—送送就好；或者到廟院裏去燒香，求　問卜，帶了幾包香灰回來，囑托病者服用「靈藥」，可是我明知這「靈藥」—香灰—對於疾病有害無益，但是當着她的面，不好意思違拗，「陽奉陰違」，暗地裏拋棄了，同同同時一面還是請醫診治。</p>
<p>這樣的，她對我不懷敵對觀念。我們很好。（朱韻琪）</p>
<p>不是笑話</p>
<p>家鄉有一則作爲「笑話」講　的故事，據說有一個孀婦，她的獨生子很孝順，在她兒子結婚的晚上，這位婆太太出於意外地移睡到小夫妻的新床上，而且　在兩者之間，給新夫婦築起一垜隔絕的「屏陣」，這樣有好久好久，給她的兒子媳婦很大難堪。我想這決不是件完全荒繆不經的「笑話」而已，而是很深刻刻刻的寓言。（井天）</p>
<p>兒子的苦悶</p>
<p>婆媳閱不睦，無疑地難　了身爲『母親的見子』又是『妻子的丈夫」者。</p>
<p>爲了不願做一個『娶了媳婦丟掉娘」或『母子共同虐待媳婦」的嫌疑者，我陷入了極度痛苦的深淵中；由是我的意志非常消沉，甚且毫無生趣可言，我屢想毀掉自已，永遠離別這個「形同地獄」的家，到另一個世界裏去。</p>
<p>要排除『婆媳間不睦」，常然最澈底的辦法是實行分居。但是問題却來了，試想在這「寸金地」及生活非易的都市中，又怎能辦到？即使可能，尚有環境的不容許呢！因爲根據慣例，媳婦進了門，阿婆便可卸責，以享淸福，消磨殘年。況且阿婆是否願意寂寞孤獨地過生活？還成疑問？所以婆媳分居在中國家庭裏又是問題。（享生）</p>
<p>我是婆婆</p>
<p>我是一個年靑的婆婆，我很同情被誤解的年靑媳婦。我覺得做婆婆的應當有個基本認識：兒子並不是財產，我對兒子的撫養，正等於我父母對我的撫養，父母給我的恩憲，我沒有全還給父母，而還給了我的下一代。我把家族的綿延　作整個人類生命的編續，我以爲兒與媳的甜蜜之愛，是合理的，順應自然的，不必如忌。我漸漸老了，我對於他（她）們責任已完，正因爲是責任，我並不斤斤計較從兒媳處得到什麼報酬。（洪果）</p>

<h3>National Assembly Commences Second Reading of Draft Constitution; Chairman Personally Attends to Explain Several Points; General Assembly to Continue This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 26th meeting of the National Assembly Presidium was held at 6:00 PM on the 21st, chaired by Liang Han-tsao. The discussion on transitional measures for the implementation of constitutional governance continued, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to hold the 27th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd to further discuss the matter. Additionally, the Presidium scheduled a meeting for the morning of the 22nd to determine the presiding officer for the 15th General Assembly session to be held at 3:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 14th General Assembly session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 21st. Chairman Chu Chia-hua presided, with 1,278 representatives in attendance. Chairman Chiang and his wife were both present, seated among the Kuomintang representatives. After announcing the opening of the session, Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as a representative of the National Assembly Presidium, delivered a report. The Chairman, dressed in a simple yellow military uniform and in high spirits, began after ascending the podium: "Fellow representatives, today the Presidium has appointed me to represent them in explaining several points to you. I am reporting to you today in my capacity as a representative. The first reading of the draft constitution has already passed, and there may still be some who are not satisfied. Therefore, I would like to clarify the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Issue of the National Capital: When drafting, I felt it was unnecessary to include it in the constitution. However, because our constitution's fundamental principles adopted more of the American constitutional approach, it was included. The original draft designated Nanjing as the capital. The First Review Committee's review resulted in a change to Beiping. The National Assembly is a rare and grand occasion, and it is hoped that everyone can be satisfied. Therefore, the point about the national capital can be omitted from the constitution.</p>
<p>(2) Article Five, Concerning Equality of All Ethnic Groups in the Republic of China: Many people advocate adding the Manchu ethnicity. However, the article already states that all ethnic groups are equal, making it unnecessary to add the Manchu separately.</p>
<p>(3) The Additional Article After Article 120, Comprising Two Revised Articles: Regarding the Mongolians, I believe that all Mongolian ethnic groups should have equal status. Regarding Tibet, the clause "The Autonomous System of Tibet Should be Guaranteed"; the word "Autonomous" can be removed.</p>
<p>(4) Article 132: The First Review Committee resolved to add an article to Chapter 12, stipulating that the number of women elected in various elections should constitute at least 20 percent. I believe this stipulation is unnecessary, but special attention should be paid during elections.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's report was met with constant applause. After the report, the second reading began. Secretary-General Hong read the entire draft constitution, and the chairman sought opinions on each article. Those without objection were passed. A total of four chapters, from Article One to Article Fifty-three, were passed in their entirety. Among them, Article Seven, concerning the issue of the national capital, was removed in accordance with the Chairman's explanation, with everyone's agreement. Amendment to Article Twenty-eight, originally stating that National Assembly representatives would be re-elected every six years, with each term of National Assembly representatives lasting until the opening day of the next National Assembly. The original article contained a clause stating that "National Assembly representatives may not concurrently hold official positions." This was subsequently deleted by the Joint Committee. Today, the issue was raised again and further amended to read: "Current officials may not be elected as representatives." This was passed by a large majority of 996 votes. The remaining articles were passed as in the first reading.</p>
<p>The following points were discussed somewhat: (1) During the reading of Article Five, Manchu representative Bi Tianmin stood up to speak, intending to explain something. However, because the atmosphere at the time was slightly chaotic, Bi Tianmin's first words after ascending the podium were: "I am a Manchu representative. Please listen carefully to what I have to say about Article Five." His words were imprudent and caused an uproar. Cries of "Get down! Get down!" and boos were incessant. People questioned why they needed to "listen carefully." At the time, Representative Bi still wanted to express his opinion, but Chen Cheng stepped forward to console him twice before he reluctantly stepped down. Afterwards, according to Chen, Representative Bi is a learned scholar who studied hygiene in America for many years but still has a health problem, which is why his words were imprudent. Furthermore, Pu Yi also stated that all Manchu representatives were following Chairman Chiang's instructions and had no ethnic bias. However, the atmosphere was temporarily chaotic. After Bi Tianmin stepped down, Kong Geng also consoled him with a harsh expression. (2) Article Nine had two proposals from Zhang Shizhao and others, which were briefly discussed. The original amendment was still passed. (3) Shi Shangkuan had a proposal for Article Thirty-eight, believing that "President of the Executive Yuan" should be changed to "President of the Relationship Yuan." It was decided that Wang Shijie would explain the meaning and importance of the countersigning power. When put to a vote, Shi's proposal was rejected by a small margin, and the original draft was passed. (4) Article Forty-one originally stated that the president had the power of amnesty, but the amendment did not. Today's meeting saw someone propose that the original draft be followed. After a vote, the amendment was still passed, and the president does not have the power of amnesty. The General Assembly adjourned at 6:00 PM. Secretary-General Hong announced that there would be no General Assembly on the morning of the 22nd, and the 15th General Assembly would be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to continue the second reading.</p>

<h3>Article One of the General Principles of the Draft Constitution Sent Directly to the Second Reading</h3>
<p>Except for Article Seven, the General Assembly Completes the First Reading</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 13th General Assembly session of the National Assembly was held at 10:40 AM on the 21st, with 1,345 representatives, including Chiang Chung-cheng, in attendance. Chairman Hu Shih led the opening ceremony as usual and reported that Wang Bingqian, a representative from the Liaoning region, had passed away due to cerebral hemorrhage at 3:00 AM this morning. The entire assembly stood up to observe a moment of silence. Afterwards, the rapporteur read the minutes of the 12th meeting, and Secretary-General Hong continued with the Presidium's report on three matters: (1) The session period was extended by two days. (2) The interpretation of the legal quorum. (3) The "Procedural Matters" for handling the review results of the various review committees (see separate article). After Chairman Hu explained, he sought opinions on the first and third points. The assembly immediately applauded and accepted them and decided that Sunday, the 22nd, would still be a full day of meetings as usual. Chairman Hu stated that the 60 representatives who requested to speak on the 20th mostly raised opinions on Articles One and Seven of the draft constitution. However, Article One, in accordance with Article One of the "Procedural Matters," where the Review Committee decided to maintain the original draft, was sent directly to the second reading without further discussion. Article Seven would also not be discussed today, and the first reading would continue to be completed. Liu Zhiping, a representative from Hunan's labor sector, stood up and demanded that Article Seven be put up for discussion. Chairman Hu replied that the article was still undergoing negotiations and would be submitted for second reading when the results were available. Subsequently, Chen Cheng added a report on five points regarding the work of the Joint Review Committee: (1) The issue of the number of votes required for the Legislative Yuan to exercise its power of reconsideration in Article Fifty-eight of the draft constitution. The Third Review Committee's review result was "two-thirds of the 'entire' Legislative Yuan members," while the Joint Review Committee revised it to "two-thirds of the 'attending' Legislative Yuan members." (2) The issue of the percentage of women elected. The First Review Committee resolved to add an article to the Twelfth Army: "Various elections should stipulate that the number of women elected should constitute at least 20 percent, and the measures shall be determined by law." The Joint Review Committee deleted the eight words "at least 20 percent." (3) The issue of the local autonomy system of minority nationalities. The Joint Review Committee, based on the Eighth Review Committee's opinion, separated and added two articles: "The local autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and banners shall be determined by law," and "The local autonomy system of Tibet shall be guaranteed." (4) The issue of the election of National Assembly representatives from indigenous peoples in Chapter Twelve. The Joint Review Committee, based on the principles determined by the First Review Committee, added an article to Chapter Twelve: "The number and election methods of National Assembly representatives from indigenous peoples with special living habits in the mainland shall be determined by law." (5) Regarding the promotion of the interests of border nationalities, the Joint Review Committee, based on the decisions of the Second and Eighth Review Committees, adopted the clauses resolved by the Eighth Review Committee and added two articles to the Thirteenth Army's Basic National Policy: "The state shall provide legal protection to the status of various ethnic groups in border areas and provide special support for local autonomy." "The state shall actively promote and support the development of education, culture, transportation, water conservancy, health, and other economic and social undertakings for various ethnic groups in border areas. The use of land shall be protected and developed according to the climate, soil properties, and people's living habits."</p>
<p>At 10:05 AM, Chen finished his speech, and the reading of the constitution began. Secretary-General Hong read each word and clause in an extremely clear voice. Chairman Hu, in accordance with the "Procedural Matters," sought the assembly's consent to handle each clause, either deciding to submit the original text to the second reading, or deciding to submit the opinion of the original × Review Committee to the second reading, or deciding to submit the opinion of the Joint Review Committee to the second reading. Proceeding to Article Seven, the First Review Committee's reviewed and revised text, "The capital of the Republic of China is set in Beiping," had just been read out by Secretary-General Hong when a storm of applause immediately erupted and continued for three minutes. After the applause subsided, Chairman Hu suggested that the original text of the draft constitution and the reviewed and revised text be submitted to the second reading for discussion. Liu Zhiping once again stood up to object, asking Hu to pay attention to and respect the majority opinion of the First Review Committee. Hu replied that the Joint Review Committee had not yet made a decision on the principle change in this article, and asked to wait until the second reading for further discussion. If there were any revised opinions, he also asked them to be submitted to the secretariat for submission to the Presidium in accordance with Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure. Secretary-General Hong then continued to read the following articles. Except for Article Thirty-one, which was deleted and not discussed in accordance with the Second Review Committee's opinion because it had become ineffective after the above related articles were revised, the remaining articles were read smoothly and submitted to the second reading in the order of the Joint Review Committee's revised opinion, the original × Review Committee's revised opinion, and the original text. There was a recess from 10:45 AM to 11:05 AM, and it was extended again at 11:56 AM and 12:15 PM, and the reading was completed at 12:25 PM. Chairman Hu stated that the first reading of the draft constitution had been completed in its entirety. Several proposals regarding transitional clauses had been submitted by the secretariat to the Presidium, and they would be submitted to the General Assembly for report and discussion as soon as they were organized. Secretary-General Hong announced that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Private Newspaper Delegation Asks for Low-Interest Loans in Nanjing; Chiang Menglin and Xu Baiyuan Agree to Assist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After arriving in Nanjing to request low-interest loans, the delegation of twelve private newspapers from Shanghai engaged in a full day of activities on the 21st. According to delegation spokesman Zhang Cangping, the delegation visited Premier Song at the Executive Yuan in the morning. However, Song and Secretary-General Chiang were both attending the National Assembly, so Secretary Li Xunhe received them and promised to forward their request to the Premier. The delegation then visited Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan of the Four Joint Offices. Xu expressed great concern for the difficulties faced by the newspapers and promised to submit the request to the board of directors of the Four Joint Offices immediately upon receiving the official document from the Central Propaganda Department and would do his best to help. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the representatives visited Secretary-General Chiang Menglin of the Executive Yuan again. Chiang promised to immediately forward the newspapers' petition to the Central Enterprise Department and request the Four Joint Offices to handle it expeditiously. Chiang also said, "Please rest assured, as long as one newspaper receives a loan, all newspapers will have no problem. The request for loans from various evening newspapers in Shanghai a few days ago has also been forwarded to the Central Propaganda Department for handling." The delegation is scheduled to visit Minister Peng and various relevant parties on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Presidium Asks General Assembly to Approve Constitution Discussion Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] During the 13th meeting of the National Assembly, the Presidium reported on three matters, with the original text as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The General Assembly session period was previously decided to be extended to December 21st, which is about to expire. It has been decided to extend it for another two days.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the motion by Representative Mu Zhendong and others on how to calculate the "more than half" and "more than two-thirds" figures in Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law, a letter was sent to the National Government to forward it to the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws Committee for resolution. The calculation of the number of "more than half" and "two-thirds" of the attending representatives referred to in Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law is based on the number that should be elected for representatives elected by election methods, and on the number announced by the National Government for representatives selected by the National Government. Furthermore, the latter half of Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law, regarding the number of representatives attending and agreeing when passing a constitution, was also submitted to the 20th meeting of the Presidium for serious discussion. The first reading of the draft constitution has seen widespread expression of opinions, and the Review Committee has reviewed it, but the stage of deciding to pass the constitution has not yet been reached. According to Article Thirty-six of the Rules of Procedure, "The clauses and wording revised and resolved in the second reading may be submitted by the Presidium to the original Review Committee or designated representatives for collation." It cannot be considered as the passage specified in the latter half of Article Twelve of the Organization Law. The meaning of the common articles is clear. If the two-thirds attendance and three-quarters agreement provisions in the latter half of Article Twelve of the Organization Law are applied during the second reading, then the constitution would have already been passed after the clauses were resolved in the second reading. Why would there be a third reading stage? This further confirms that the passage of the constitution is in the third reading. In other words, when passing the entire constitution in the third reading, there must be an attendance of more than two-thirds and the agreement of three-quarters of the attending representatives. This should be recorded and reported.</p>
<p>(3) The draft constitution of the Republic of China has been reviewed separately by various review committees. Those that needed to be reviewed by the Joint Review Committee have also been discussed and decided by the Joint Review Committee and reported to the General Assembly. In accordance with Article Thirty-four of the Rules of Procedure, after the review committee explains the review process and results for the motions that have been reviewed, the general discussion and resolution: either open the second reading, or submit for review again. In order to make the meeting proceed</p>
<h3>Liaoning Representative Wang Bingqian Passes Away Due to Cerebral Hemorrhage</h3>
<p>Entire Assembly of the 13th National Assembly Stands to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Wang Bingqian, a National Assembly representative from Liaoning, passed away this morning at 3:00 AM due to cerebral hemorrhage. Wang was 61 years old. He had been traveling around tirelessly during the National Assembly session. He recently suffered from a cough but still participated in meetings while ill. After returning to his private residence at No. 38 Jiangjun Lane after the evening meeting on the 20th and talking with friends, he went to bed. At this time, the cough worsened, and breathing became urgent. An urgent telegram was sent to the National Assembly Secretariat to send a doctor to see him, who diagnosed cerebral hemorrhage. Resuscitation was ineffective, and he passed away at 3:00 AM in the morning. Wang was from Jinxi, Liaoning. He followed the Premier in participating in the revolution early on. In the early years of the Republic, he served as a counselor in the Grand Marshal's Office and a member of parliament. In 1929, he returned to the Northeast and took on party affairs work, serving as the secretary-general of the Jilin Provincial Party Headquarters. In 1933, he was transferred to serve as a legislator until now. He has participated in the constitution-making work from the May Fifth Draft to this National Assembly, but he did not live to see the promulgation of the constitution. Everyone in his position mourns his passing. His remains were moved to the Chinese Funeral Home this morning for encoffining. His wife and nephew were by his side. His son, Wang Qiming, is currently studying at the Dihua Military Branch School. This morning, when the 13th National Assembly session opened, Chairman Hu Shih announced the news of Wang's death, and the entire assembly stood to observe a minute of silence.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The encoffining of the remains of National Assembly Representative Wang Bingqian is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 22nd at the Chinese Funeral Home. All representatives will attend the memorial service. For convenience, the Presidium has decided on the following procedures:</p>
<p>(1) Those where the various review committees decided to maintain the original draft will not be discussed further and will be sent directly to the second reading.</p>
<p>(2) Amendments where the Joint Review Committee's and the various review committees' opinions are the same will be submitted to the second reading.</p>
<p>(3) Amendments where the Joint Review Committee's and the various review committees' opinions differ will be discussed and decided by the General Assembly: either submitted to the second reading or submitted to the Joint Review Committee for review again.</p>
<p>(4) If there are revised opinions on the reports of the original review committee and the Joint Review Committee, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p>(Note) Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly: "Those who propose amendments to the results of the various review committees of the draft constitution should prepare specific items and attach reasons, and must have the joint signature of 30 or more representatives. They should be sent to the Presidium and submitted to the Secretary-General for printing and sending to all representatives before the second reading."</p>
<h3>National Assembly Women Representatives Insist on Election Quotas</h3>
<p>Engaging in Various Activities During Consecutive Days of Meetings</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The women representatives' request that the constitution explicitly stipulate a 20 percent election ratio for women was rejected on the 20th, but they obtained a guarantee of ordinary legislation. However, they are still unwilling to give up and intend to persist in this demand. During the recess of the General Assembly on the 21st, most of the women representatives gathered in the east hall on the second floor of the assembly hall and refused to allow reporters to listen in. However, the voices of "Please invite Madam Chiang to invite Chairman Chiang to attend today's afternoon meeting" and "Elect five representatives..." were heard from outside the curtain. It is said that they will continue to meet in the afternoon of the 21st to engage in activities.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping by Air; He and Marshal Ma Continue to Strive for Peace; People's Socialist Party Pays Attention to Truman's Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 21st] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping by air at 12:38 PM on the 21st. His personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, Lu Zhiwei, chairman of the Yanjing University Affairs Council, and Cai Yihai, director of general affairs, came with him. General Gillen, American Consul Meishi, and Jie Jiemin all went to the airport to welcome him. After Stuart got off the plane, he was surrounded by reporters at both the airport and Yanjing University. Stuart said that there was no progress in the current situation, and there was no decision on the government sending personnel to Yan'an. He and Marshal Ma had no intention of going to Yan'an recently. The ambassador refused to offer any explanation or criticism of Truman's statement. When asked if there was no hope for China's peaceful future, he replied: Only the Chinese people themselves can decide their common destiny. However, the ambassador also stated that he and Marshal Ma are still willing to not let go of every possible opportunity to engage in peaceful efforts. He said: It is hoped that the National Assembly will pass a more democratic constitution than the May Fifth Draft. This will be a beneficial move for the future of peace and implied that the situation may take a turn for the better as a result. When a reporter asked whether he would meet with Ye Jianying when he came to Beiping, he replied: There is no need for this. The ambassador is scheduled to spend Christmas in Beiping and then go to Tianjin to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and commerce.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 21st] Well-informed sources say: (1) The government will send personnel to Yan'an after the government is reorganized. The reorganized government will still reserve places for the CCP. (2) Truman's statement is internal in nature. Marshal Ma and Gillen also participated in drafting part of it beforehand.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Xu Chuanlin, the Minister of Propaganda of the People's Socialist Party, recently made the following statement regarding President Truman's statement on China policy. President Truman's statement on China policy is not significantly different from what he stated in his previous resolution. However, today, as we are making a constitution, we feel that its meaning is not ordinary and deserves our special attention. Most importantly, President Truman repeatedly stated "respect for China's sovereignty and non-interference in China's internal affairs." We sincerely accept this statement and extend our gratitude. President Truman hopes that we will form a government that unites the country. However, a legitimate democratic government has not yet been concretely formed. In other words, the so-called democratic politics, as practiced by countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, is what Truman expects us to strive to achieve. In fact, there is still some distance. Regarding this point of view, our hopes are absolutely the same as those of President Truman. We hope that in the near future, a legitimate democratic government will include all parties and factions to jointly create a democratic and political China. If this can be achieved, not only will President Truman's declaration on China come to an ideal and factual conclusion, but we also believe that world peace will be laid on a solid foundation due to China's internal peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] A reporter recently visited Zhang Qun and asked him to express his opinion on President Truman's statement. According to him: Based on what I saw in the United States over the past year and what I understand about President Truman's statement this time, I deeply feel that the United States' China policy has never changed. In particular, this statement is more systematic and practical, and all misunderstandings can be clarified. Zhang also told him that after the National Assembly closes, he will go back and take care of everything.</p>
<h3>President Encourages National Assembly Representatives to Contribute Opinions on the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>Yesterday Hosted Representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party, Youth Party, and Social Elites</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] President Chiang hosted a banquet at the Lixingshe at 7 p.m. on the 21st for all National Assembly representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party, social elites, and the Youth Party, with over 300 guests and hosts. Wu Dingchang, Kong Xiangxi, Lei Zhen, and others were in attendance to welcome guests. The seating arrangements were predetermined, with Li Daming and Xu Fulin sharing the role of chairman. During the banquet, President Chiang delivered a speech, stating: "The participation of various parties in the National Assembly's opening is a sign of harmonious cooperation. I hope for even more satisfactory results, new progress, and new developments in the future. I also hope that all representatives will contribute valuable insights to the Constitution." In his response, Li Daming stated: "Currently, many people in China are focusing on economic issues. In reality, constitutional issues are even more important than economic ones. If the Constitution can be successfully completed, politics will be on the right track, and economic problems can also be resolved as a result. Listening to President Chiang's speech, I deeply understand his sincerity in completing the Constitution. The future of China's Constitution is certainly bright. However, we not only hope that the Constitution can be passed but also implemented in accordance with it, so that China can embark on the path of glory and build a new China."

<h3>General Review Committee Concludes</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>(4) The proposal to add clauses on the division of provinces and regions was passed without objection.</p>
<p>(5) The revision of the chapter on elections to the chapter on the initiative, referendum, recall, and election, and the addition of new clauses: the opinion of the organizing committee was to approve the modification of the chapter name according to the revised opinion, and the whole body also passed it without objection. However, regarding the added clauses, Chen Shaoxian said: "I agree in principle, but the wording should be submitted to the organizing committee." Jiang Yiping said: "There are already provisions in Article 27, so if more are added, there will inevitably be conflicts and should be submitted for reference." Ren Zhuoxuan said: "This is a legal loophole because there are only provisions for the method of election, and nothing else is mentioned. Can the people only use the right to vote? Therefore, adding the initiative, referendum, and recall can further implement democracy. I agree in principle." The organizing committee voted and decided to add the clauses, which were unanimously approved. Subsequently, Lei Zhen reported again on the First Review Committee's review of the election of professional representatives and female representatives. At the time, a Hui representative stated: "The number of people with different lifestyles should be stipulated." Wang Xiaoying explained that there should be textual modifications, which did not need to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, and that the latter part of the clause on the Legislative Yuan could be canceled, but the quota of 20% should be retained. Liu Baimin said: "The elections and recalls all refer to the central government but neglect the provincial and county levels, which should be noted." It was then decided to refer the Hui issue, etc., to the conveners of the first group and the organizing committee for consultation and decision.</p>
<p>(6) The chapter division of the fundamental national policy was passed by a relatively large majority. Liu Zongping again requested attention to the arrangement of border issues when dividing the chapters. Hu Shi and more than 30 others provided opinions, namely to explain the cancellation of the amendment opinion on Article 137 regarding the United Nations Charter. Hu said: "This case was proposed by some people who care about world peace. The provisions of this article can also be said to set a precedent in the world, but if it is stipulated and then canceled, it may cause misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, you can add the words 'and the United Nations Charter' under the revised bill to respect the treaty, which will not harm the national constitution and will have a good impact on the world," which was immediately passed.</p>
<p>(7) Adding a clause on marriage caused a burst of laughter in the hall. Some people thought it was unnecessary to discuss it, some thought it was a joke, and some said it was unnecessary to be embarrassing. Lei Zhen also reported that the organizing committee believed that it was beyond the scope of the constitution, and the whole body immediately believed that it was unnecessary to discuss it.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding students' separation from parties, Lei said: "The regulations for students are too broad. It is not clear whether they refer to middle school students, college students, or researchers." Leng Xin said: "The Constitution stipulates that people have freedom of belief, so it was decided not to include it."</p>
<p>(9) Passed according to the original plan.</p>
<p>(10) The interpretation of the Constitution does not happen very often, so there is no need to set up another institution, maintain the original plan, and pass it.</p>
<p>(11) Maintain the original plan.</p>
<p>(12) Passed according to the opinion of the organizing committee. After garbage and two limited items were submitted to the organizing committee.</p>

<h3>The Franco-Vietnamese War is Escalating; President of the Viet Minh Government Flees; French Forces Control Hanoi and Declare Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] Saigon reports: the war in Hanoi is expanding, and the Viet Minh autonomous government has withdrawn from the area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hanoi, 21st] French and Vietnamese troops continued to fight today on the edge of the Annamese residential area of Hanoi. Part of the district has caught fire, but the European residential area remains under French control. According to reliable sources: Ho Chi Minh, the president of the Viet Minh Republic, and the Minister of War and other members of the delegation, all fled Hanoi on the 19th of this month after the French Commissioner for Tonkin, Sainteny, was injured at the French military headquarters in Tokyo. English military leader Edward has taken control of the government, immediately declaring martial law and enforcing restrictions. People are not allowed to carry weapons without special permission.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] According to Vietnamese sources: this morning, French troops stormed the Presidential Palace and hoisted the French flag over the residence and the Vietnamese Parliament. French troops used small-scale attacks to eliminate resistance, and gunfire continued throughout the day.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hanoi, 21st] The French military commander in Tokyo, Morey, issued a declaration tonight stating: "The Viet Minh army's launch of this war is the same as the Japanese invasion in March 1945. The leaders of the Viet Minh Republic government have fled, and the French authorities must restore order." The Viet Minh army began its attack at 10 p.m. on the 19th of this month. At that time, the lights in the city suddenly went out. There were many French soldiers on the street, who were returning from the movies on their way to the barracks. Suddenly, gunfire broke out everywhere, making it difficult to distinguish between grenade explosions and rifle fire. Trucks and armored vehicles were constantly traveling on the streets. After fierce fighting, French troops occupied the municipal theater and the water and electricity companies the next day. The Presidential Palace of the Viet Minh Republic was also occupied. The Viet Minh army is still using artillery to bombard Hanoi.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 21st] French and Vietnamese troops are still fighting fiercely in Hanoi, with both sides using machine guns and heavy ground.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Recent reports from Vietnam say: French troops and Vietnamese troops fought fiercely in Hanoi all day, and French troops dispatched tanks to fight. Fu Zhizhong has asked the French government to resume negotiations to avoid massacres. Other reports say: Viet Minh troops have also attacked towns north of Hanoi. The port of Wenya, 150 miles south of Hanoi, has also been cut off from external communications.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] All sectors of France today received reports from Vietnam saying: There is a large fire in Hanoi, but the number of casualties is unknown. French officials in Hanoi strongly stated that the Viet Minh army attacked the city from the suburbs with artillery, similar to the Japanese attack on March 9 last year. There were also Japanese in the Viet Minh army. A report from Nanjing also stated: Two leaders of the Viet Minh Kuomintang asked the United States and China to mediate the war. The French political situation is unstable, a formal government has not yet been established, and the Communist Party has openly expressed sympathy for the Viet Minh, making the situation even more complicated.</p>

At 4 p.m. today, the French military commander in Haiphong had not received any news from the Hanoi army, which made people think that the outside world had exaggerated the local situation too much. Blum also told the parliamentary delegation of the Socialist Party this morning: "Since last night, we have not received new news from Vietnam, and the general staff has not received fresh reports. Due to the lack of news, it proves that the situation in Hanoi has not changed."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] The French National Assembly met today, and the Minister of Overseas Colonies, Moutet, made a brief report on the situation in Vietnam. He briefly stated: "The situation in Vietnam is not as serious as reported. We are sincerely committed to peace, but we do not intend to yield to any acts of violence. The government is prepared to explain all aspects of the situation in Vietnam, but this requires the government to send personnel to Vietnam for inspection. Any political agreement can only be implemented if both parties faithfully abide by it. France will never abandon its people and any friends who may be sacrificed by violence. The policy adopted by the French government is to insist on its interests and gain respect. We will do everything we can to achieve this goal through reconciliation." At this point, the Speaker of the National Assembly proposed a resolution of sympathy for the French army in Vietnam, which was unanimously passed.</p>

<h3>Pei Tsu-yi Flew to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning; Visited President Soong on the Eve of Departure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] President of the Central Bank, Pei Tsu-yi, flew to Hong Kong by special plane at 9 a.m. yesterday. He was accompanied by the British financial advisor to the Central Bank, Rogers, Director of the Issuing Bureau Liang Ping, Director of the Auditing Office Li Lixia, and more than a dozen relevant personnel from various bureaus and offices, as well as secretaries.

<h3>China Has Submitted to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration a List of the Most Needed Items; Interview with Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, returned to Shanghai after attending the 6th Congress of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the United States. A reporter interviewed Li yesterday, and he reported that although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to end relief to China by the end of June next year, and the transportation work will also end quietly by the end of September next year, it is feared that the work will not be completed in time, which will affect relief to China. Therefore, the Chinese representatives proposed a supplementary teaching method at the meeting in Washington and urged the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strengthen its transportation capacity to China. The goods ordered by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for China in various factories are also expected to be delivered as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has also decided to review the progress of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief to China in February and March next year. If the goods ordered at that time cannot be mostly delivered, the funds for these goods will be used to purchase ready-made grain for early transportation to China. A list of the most urgently needed relief items in China has been drawn up so that grain, fertilizer, etc. can be purchased locally immediately when necessary and transported to China. The United States has made the greatest contribution to the relief work this time, with the relief materials supplied by the United States accounting for 70% of the total, especially industrial and agricultural equipment. Canada has expressed great sympathy for China and has been approved by the General Assembly to join the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Far East Committee, which the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration welcomes very much. Regarding the supply of materials to the Chinese Communist Party area, Li said that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes materials based on the principle of fairness. Recently, it has been personally approved by President Chiang to allocate a large sum of money to the Yellow River Pan-Communist Party area to relieve 200,000 residents in the old course of the Yellow River in the area. This sum of money can be said to be a rare large amount, which shows that the Chinese Communist Party has broken some facilities on its own, and it is not that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes them unfairly. Finally, when talking about the new director-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, General Rooks, Li deeply appreciated his person and said: "He knows China very well and has expressed to the General Assembly his willingness to be responsible for the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration until it is completed." After returning to China, Deputy Director Li visited President Soong in Beijing the day before yesterday to report on the meeting.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Guangdong Province's Construction; Wengjiang Hydropower Project to Start Construction Next Spring; All Provincial Highways to Be Completed and Opened to Traffic by a Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 20th] The reporter visited Guangdong Construction Minister Xie Wenlong and inquired about the current situation of provincial construction. According to him, the Wengjiang Hydropower Project has been resurveyed by a survey team sent from Shanghai for more than two months. It can be measured and completed next spring and construction will start at the same time. The estimated construction cost is US$30 million, which will take two years to complete, and can generate 50,000 horsepower. As for the damaged highways in the province, they must all be opened to traffic before August next year. The central government previously planned to designate 3,600 kilometers of provincial roads as national highways, but 75% of the province's highways are privately owned. If the central government takes them over as national highways, it must guarantee the interests of road merchants, which is to rationally determine the value of privately owned highways and compensate and develop post-war reconstruction funds for each road. The central government has now expressed its acceptance and consideration. The national highways that will be transferred first are the three main lines of Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Zhanjiang-Shishan. The construction cost for farmland water conservancy next year will total more than 40 billion yuan. Various water conservancy projects are currently under construction. The Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau has also sent personnel to Youfu City for surveying and plans to open the city as a third-class commercial port. It has been found that the water in the port is very deep, but the port is accumulated with mud and many minerals, so ships of more than 3,000 tons are currently difficult to enter. The bureau has decided to start construction next year.</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Drafted Ten-Year Construction Outline</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Provincial Assembly for Review</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 19th] The Hunan Provincial Government has drafted a ten-year construction outline for Hunan and submitted it to the current Provincial Assembly for review. The plan is divided into three parts: (1) the economic sector includes agriculture, transportation, and mining; (2) the political sector aims to complete local autonomy and implement constitutional government; (3) the cultural sector takes the establishment of the Three People's Principles as the central idea as the highest principle and implements Liu education. The entire plan is divided into three phases for completion, with the first phase being four years, and the second and third phases being three years each. After completion, Binhu will be an agricultural area, Zhuzhou will be an industrial area, and Hengshan will be a cultural area. The Provincial Assembly is very interested in this case and will study it in detail.</p>
<h3>First Batch of US Surplus Materials from Mariana Islands to Be Shipped to Shanghai Tomorrow; Shipment Will Take 22 Months to Complete</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Guam, 20th] Hundreds of thousands of tons of US military surplus materials from the Mariana Islands, which were previously ceded to China, will be packed and shipped to China by the Vennell Company, which is contracted to transport them, starting today. Most of these materials are located on Guam, Saipan, and Tinian. The company will handle the shipment in accordance with the contract signed by China and the United States in Nanjing this summer, and will be given a considerable amount of remuneration after completing the shipment within 22 months. The surplus materials in Okinawa will be transported by the Morrison Knudsen Company. According to Kikland, manager of the design department of Vennell Company in Guam, who told a reporter from the Associated Press: "It is planned to ship the first batch of 8,000 tons of surplus materials to Shanghai in January next year. The surplus materials on Guam, Saipan, and Tinian have now been classified by American Army and Navy technicians as relief food and clothing, and the transportation equipment to transport these relief materials from Shanghai to the mainland will be given priority for shipment." According to a spokesman for the US Overseas Surplus Property Disposal Committee in Guam: "The surplus materials do not include military supplies, aircraft, or ship equipment." According to the Nanjing Agreement, only the United States can decide which materials are surplus materials. In addition, the surplus materials purchased by China from the United States are limited to those that have not been sold to other countries or have been negotiated before August 31 of this year. According to Kikland: "The amount purchased by China cannot be accurately known, because the US military supply station and main personnel in Mariana have been demobilized, and the wartime situation was chaotic, so precise statistics could not be completed, but in any case, there must be hundreds of thousands of tons. The Army and Navy have taken good care of the surplus materials, and many of them are still in good condition." The two transportation companies are now mobilizing 116 American technicians, 408 Chinese technicians, and skilled technicians, truck drivers, etc. to start the transportation work on Mariana Island. Several Far East shipping companies will provide ships to carry materials to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Special Article: The Timing of Currency Reform</h3>
<p>— Yu Zengkang</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent rumors in the market about currency reform. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied them, they continue to occur, and each time they arise, they cause market turmoil, forcing the people to be deeply concerned. At the same time, scholars have also begun to discuss it. It can be seen that the currency issue has become a serious problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current economy.</p>
<p>The currency system has been devastated by the war and must be restored. However, does the legal tender system have any value to maintain? Does the currency system need to be rebuilt? This is a question worth considering first. First, the inflation of the legal tender to this point has made transactions and accounting inconvenient. Second, prices have risen six or seven thousand times. Even if the price increases stop immediately, the people's feeling of excessively high prices will still be difficult to remove. Therefore, the unhealthy concept of valuing goods over the currency cannot be corrected. If the credibility of the legal tender cannot be restored, how can the distorted economy return to the right track? It will inevitably hinder the post-war economic recovery and reconstruction. Third, China's current position in the international economy has been greatly enhanced. However, a legal tender with such a low value cannot consolidate international credibility and shoulder the arduous mission of regulating international finance, stabilizing international currency, developing world trade, and promoting world prosperity. Based on the above, whether for domestic or foreign needs, the chaotic currency system must be reformed as soon as possible. Therefore, currency reform is, in fact, no longer a question of whether or not to do it, but merely a question of timing.</p>
<p>Currency reform must carefully choose the timing, otherwise it will be in vain and will easily cause unnecessary fluctuations. At a time when people are restless and the economy is chaotic, the timing should be carefully chosen. The so-called timing is when it is possible to quickly restore the currency price, stabilize the currency value, and shorten the period of economic chaos, so that currency reform is most likely to be effective. Scholars have frequently discussed this issue, but their opinions vary, and therefore their proposals are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Many contemporary scholars advocate immediate reform, using currency reform to stabilize the economy. If the goal of stabilizing the economy can be achieved, it is of course desirable. Their reasons are nothing more than the following: First, the legal tender has lost the confidence of the people, and the currency system must be rebuilt as soon as possible in order to restore currency credibility, reduce the circulation speed of currency, and stabilize prices. Second, financial balance can only be achieved under a new currency system with a stable currency value. Third, currency reform must be implemented after the economy is stable, but who knows when that will be? It is better to reorganize immediately so that it can be stabilized and benefit the development of the economy. Fourth, the current market has been deeply disturbed by the legal tender. Rather than prolong the process of disturbance, it is better to use a quick knife to cut through the mess and readjust. Although the above points are not without reason, they are also somewhat specious.</p>
<p>(1) Immediate currency reform has many difficulties in terms of reform techniques. First, prices are still fluctuating. If currency reform is implemented immediately, at what point will the currency value be stabilized? Second, the degree of price increases for various goods varies greatly, and there are also significant differences between regions. What goods and regions will be used as the standard? If Shanghai is used as the standard, the stability of the vast inland areas will be sacrificed. If an average price index is used as the standard, the impact on various industries will be different due to the differences, and it will still be difficult to avoid favoring one over the other. Third, the determination of the exchange rate must consider the trend of trade and the situation of international payments. At a time when foreign economic relations have not yet been soundly established and trade has not yet entered the right track, it is even more difficult to predict. Before technical difficulties can be overcome, the currency value is prescribed. Who knows if it will be beneficial? And who can guarantee its long-term stability?</p>
<p>(2) Even if a reasonable standard can be obtained to restore the balance between exchange rates and prices, it will be even more difficult to maintain the currency value when production is weak and trade is in reverse. Any change in one aspect is enough to break the balance. If it feels inappropriate, it will be almost impossible to adjust. Because: First, if the currency value changes again after currency reform, it will inevitably lose confidence, and the possible adverse phenomena that may arise will inevitably be even worse than today. Would the reform be in vain? Second, if the exchange rate is fixed, it will be subject to the international monetary fund. If it is to be adjusted again, it must be after six months, and the range cannot exceed 10%. Wouldn't it be subject to the pain of sacrificing domestic prices to stabilize foreign prices? In short, currency reform should not be taken lightly before there is confidence in stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>(3) It is impossible to achieve absolute balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure under an unstable currency system. However, if currency reform is immediately implemented at present, and a stable currency value reappears, the financial situation under objective conditions will still be difficult to improve. Because even under active fiscal reorganization, there is still a huge deficit, and this deficit cannot be eliminated by economic allocation. Therefore, it is difficult to believe the saying that currency reform can balance finances. If finance continues to rely on issuance to make up for it, how can the credibility of the currency be consolidated even if the currency system is rebuilt? I am afraid that the immediate reform of the currency system will not only fail to help balance finance, but the new currency system will still be destroyed by the unbalanced finance. Moreover, if fiscal reorganization can be actively promoted, there is still a possibility of approaching balance under the current legal tender system. Why not wait until fiscal reorganization has made considerable achievements before reforming the currency system so that it can be effective?</p>
<p>(4) If you want to rebuild currency credibility and reduce the circulation speed of currency through currency reform, this effect will not be lasting when the reform conditions are not met. When people find that there are unreasonable aspects of the new currency system, disturbances will inevitably start again and still fall into an unimaginable situation. Moreover, people's hearts are extremely restless now, and they have no goodwill towards currency reform, but have a sense of fear. Just look at the market, and when there is a rumor of reform, there will be great fluctuations. In this way, even temporary effectiveness cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>(5) The increase in production must be realized under a stable currency value. However, there are many reasons for the decline in production now. Currency value fluctuations are just one of them. There are other, more difficult factors to solve. Therefore, it is difficult to seriously believe the saying that currency reform can revive the industry. The equilibrium relationship between production and consumption has been broken for a long time, and it cannot be restored overnight. If the equilibrium state cannot be repeated, it will be difficult for prices to stabilize. If prices are not stable, what is the benefit of currency reform?</p>
<p>(6) As for market reorganization, it seems to be a superficial way to achieve it through currency reform. The disruption of the market is intensified by currency value fluctuations, but there are still more problems in its own defects. If the defects exist, even if there is a stable currency value, the market will still be difficult to have peace. Before the war, the market had already been shrouded in a speculative atmosphere, which can be used as proof. Moreover, there are doubts about whether currency credibility can be rebuilt if currency reform is implemented immediately. I am afraid that it will also be difficult to renovate the speculative market.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it is impossible to stabilize the economy through currency reform under the current situation. Not only will currency system reconstruction be in vain, but economic chaos will be intensified. Moreover, although absolute economic stability cannot be achieved under the legal tender system, relative stability is still possible. Judging from recent facts, although prices continue to rise, the amplitude of fluctuations is no longer as severe as in the past under the authorities' austerity policies. If there is a real determination to stabilize prices and a comprehensive and effective countermeasure, we believe that the degree of increase can be further reduced, and any sudden changes in prices can be avoided. When the rising trend of prices weakens, speculative activities will be drastically reduced, and the wind of hoarding can also be greatly reduced. Both the financial market and the commodity market will gain considerable stability. Moreover, after speculation declines and the rising trend of prices slows down, it will soon decline, and the credit position of the industry will be improved, which will benefit production. According to past experience, relative economic stability and partial resolution of serious problems can be achieved under the legal tender system. As for currency reform, once it is implemented, it must be successful and cannot be reorganized a second time. If it fails, currency reform will not only lose credibility with the people, but will also damage the status of international finance. The possibility of failure is high if it is implemented at present. Why not take cautious measures and implement reform after the economy has achieved considerable stability? Haste makes waste, and there are many disadvantages. The currency issue, which is of great importance to the future of China's economic development, cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Studying world history, there are two ways to reform the currency system: First, reform comes first, and economic stability comes later. Most of the countries that adopt this approach are in a stage where the currency system is about to collapse. The old currency has no need to exist, and it is no longer possible to achieve relative economic stability under the old currency, and the degree of chaos has reached its extreme. It cannot be overcome without rebuilding the currency system. Under this circumstance, the establishment of the new currency system does not need to take into account the value of the old currency, and the exchange rate with the old currency and the new exchange rate can be arbitrarily determined without technical difficulties. After the currency system is rebuilt, efforts are made to reorganize finance and revitalize production, and economic stability can be achieved. Second, currency reform comes after economic stability. This is because although the currency system has been maliciously inflated, it has not yet reached the stage of collapse; and the old currency is still accepted by the people and still has temporary value; although it has reached the stage where reform is necessary, it can still obtain relative stability. There are many technical difficulties in this type of reform, and it is not simple. The current situation of China's legal tender is similar to the latter, so the steps taken in the reform cannot be superficial.</p>
<p>The choice of timing is of great importance to the success of implementation, and it cannot be hastily considered. Based on the above, currency reform must take economic stability as a prerequisite, so the current time is not right. It must wait until the economy has achieved considerable stability before it is the time for reform. Therefore, we must now work hard to stabilize the economy in order to prepare for currency reform. With sufficient preparation, it will be easy to reform the currency system in the future. Haste makes waste, and there are many disadvantages. The currency issue, which is of great importance to the future of China's economic development, cannot be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan: More Severe Than the Great Kanto Earthquake; Three Islands Shaken, Thousands Dead and Injured, Disaster Area Expanding</h3>
<p>[Tokyo Report from Gaizosha, 21st] An unprecedented earthquake occurred in the Shikoku Island area of Japan early on the 21st. According to an investigation by the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, the damage situation as of 5:00 p.m. is as follows: The main disaster-stricken prefectures are Wakayama, Mie, Okayama, Aichi, Gifu, Osaka, Kochi, Shiga, Hyogo, Shizuoka, Nara, Oita, Tokushima, Ehime, Hiroshima, Tottori, Shimane, and Kyoto, totaling 18 prefectures. The number of casualties is 500 dead, 612 injured, and 43 missing. In terms of house damage, 4,500 houses were completely destroyed, and 9,044 houses were partially destroyed. Other buildings: 381 completely destroyed, 761 partially destroyed. Factories: 21 completely destroyed, 100 partially destroyed. 1,744 houses were washed away, and 1,406 fishing boats were washed away or damaged. In addition, the entire city of Kushimoto in Wakayama Prefecture was flooded. According to the Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory, the earthquake occurred at 4:19 a.m. on the 21st, with the epicenter located 100 miles southwest of Wakayama, at 135 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude. The strongest tremors were felt in the southern part of Kinki, the eastern half of Shikoku, and part of Shiga. The area affected by the earthquake was very wide, reaching as far as Kyushu and the northeastern part of Honshu. It is also said that this earthquake was more severe than the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Republic of China Year 12) and is the largest earthquake in Japan.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the earthquake, the occupation forces dispatched aircraft to investigate signs of a tsunami along the coast of Japan, but have not yet released a report. The damage to occupation forces’ facilities and troops is also under investigation.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Report from United Press, 21st] Reports of deaths, losses, and destruction from this morning's earthquake and tsunami continue to come in from central and northern Honshu, but they are all from Japanese sources and the Japanese are known to exaggerate, so they cannot be easily believed.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] According to a dispatch from Kyodo News Agency today, as of 2:00 p.m. when the dispatch was sent, the number of known casualties in the Osaka earthquake was around 970, including 422 deaths, 498 injuries, and 40 missing.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] This earthquake shook the three islands of Japan: Shikoku, Honshu, and Kyushu. This morning's earthquake was not caused by a volcano, but by crustal movement.</p>
<p>[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] Allied occupation forces were injured or killed in the earthquake. The British occupation forces were the first to report that one of their soldiers was missing in the earthquake. There was some damage to buildings in the British occupation zone, but the British said the investigation was not yet complete.</p>

<h3>US Atomic Control Plan: Approved in Principle; Appointed Subcommittee to Study Details; Soviet Request for Postponement of Discussion Rejected</h3>
<p>[Lake Success Report from United Press, 20th] Today, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission approved the United States' atomic energy control plan in principle. This is the first vote since discussions on control issues began in June of this year and can be considered a partial victory for US Representative Baruch. Mr. Baruch insisted on a yes-or-no vote on his ambitious plan, but finally complied with Canada's compromise, which stipulated that it be accepted in principle and that a subcommittee be appointed to study it so that the plan's content would be consistent with the disarmament resolution recently passed by the UN General Assembly. The final vote was ten to zero, with Poland abstaining. Soviet Representative Gromyko refused to vote, telling the chairman, "I am not participating in this discussion," but stated that this was not an abstention. The Soviet request to postpone the discussion for a week and the Polish proposal to submit the US proposal directly to the subcommittee without a vote were both rejected.</p>
<p>During the three-hour meeting, Gromyko stated that he had no time to study the US proposal and therefore could not participate in the vote at this time. Gromyko repeatedly requested the committee to grant a week for consideration. Representatives from China and the United Kingdom privately urged Gromyko to agree to the Canadian compromise, but he ignored them.</p>
<p>One of the key points of the US proposal is that penalties for violations of atomic control should not be subject to veto power. This immediately aroused speculation among the representatives as to whether the subcommittee would interpret this sentence as being consistent with the UN General Assembly's disarmament resolution when drafting the report, as the UN resolution only stipulated that investigations of violations should not be subject to veto power. Other key points of the US proposal include: (1) Establishing an international atomic energy control agency; (2) Establishing an international inspection system; (3) Prohibiting the manufacture and use of atomic weapons; (4) Gradually implementing control, with the United States announcing atomic secrets according to the progress of the control phase.</p>
<p>[Paris Report from Agence France-Presse, 21st] Senator McMahon, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, left here this morning for London on official business.</p>

<h3>All American Youth Should Receive Universal Training; Emphasizing Moral, Intellectual, and Physical Education; President Orders Military Training Committee to Draft Broad Plan</h3>
<p>[Washington Report from United Press, 20th] President Truman today ordered the National Military Training Committee to draft a broad plan that, in addition to military training, pays attention to the physical, mental, and moral development of young people, so as to avoid the fate of ancient Rome and other great countries in history, where people become idle and do nothing after becoming wealthy. At the same time, this training plan, which promotes the moral, intellectual, physical, and military development of youth, should not only be limited to boys, but should also be applied to young men and women. The plan proposed by the Department of the Army only stipulates that young people over the age of 18 must receive military training.</p>
<h3>Based on the Experience of World War II; US Reorganizes Combat Units; Actively Engaged in Building "Amphibious Divisions"; Adopting Mechanized Operations in Sea, Land, and Air</h3>
<p>[Washington Report from United States Information Service, 20th] General Devers, Commander of the US Army Ground Forces, announced tonight that the United States will reorganize its infantry and armored units based on the experience gained in World War II. After increasing the strength of the infantry by one-fifth, we can increase artillery equipment threefold and increase firepower more than threefold. The purpose of this plan is to build an "amphibious division" that can conduct rapid mechanized operations in the sea, land, and air. During World War II, V2 rockets continued to attack our troops and civilians in Belgium and the United Kingdom until our ground troops penetrated the launch sites, eliminated the Nazi covering forces, and destroyed the sites and rocket arsenals. In future wars, the goals of our ground forces will be the same. The enemy will never stop attacking the American people themselves until our infantry, armored units, and artillery land at enemy airfields and rocket launch bases and destroy them. After this, the strength of each US Army division in combat can be increased from 17,000 to 18,000 men, an increase of 3,000 men over World War II, but to save personnel and equipment, the current number of men per US division is 14,000. As for the new armored divisions, the number of men will be 15,000. Based on the experience of World War II, a battalion of infantry is added to each armored division, in addition to a battalion of heavy tanks and a battalion each of artillery and anti-aircraft guns. In terms of equipment, one of the most important changes is the addition of a transport aircraft capable of carrying 530 personnel. The number of light tanks in the armored division will be reduced, but the number of medium tanks will be increased. In the infantry, each division will add a battalion each of independent tanks and anti-aircraft guns, and add mortars to increase firepower by 50%. The number of men in each infantry squad will be reduced from 12 to 9, and the engineer battalion will add four squads and a bridge-building squad.</p>
<h3>America's Potential Enemy: On the Other Side of the Northeastern Arctic</h3>
<p>Intensifying Research on Defense Plans</p>
<p>[New York Report from Central News Agency/Associated Press, 20th] Major General Anderson, Commander of the Air Force War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, stated today at a meeting of the Arctic Committee of the Navigation Society in New York that Arctic icebergs can be used as temporary airfields in wartime to defend against attacks on the mainland from the Arctic. Army engineers have informed the Air Force that the Arctic can be used as various types of airfields and is very easy to build, requiring only the laying of steel landing mats. He also said that the US Army Air Corps' strategic concept for the Arctic region is based on a realistic confidence. The defense of the mainland should include a plan for Arctic air power. Mr. Anderson said that the potential enemy we see today is on the other side of the Arctic. When planning the defense of future wars, we must plan to coordinate strategy with special combat. The proposal by the US Navy to build eight giant airships, each with a gas capacity of 10 million cubic feet, to navigate the North and South Poles for survey work was revealed today in a report to the Legislative Navigation Committee.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspapers Call on Youth to Develop Soviet Far East</h3>

<h3>Smuts Worries About the Status of White People; Two-Thirds of Representatives in UN Organizations are People of Color</h3>
<p>[Pretoria, South Africa Report from Reuters, 20th] South African Prime Minister Smuts said at a reception here today that in United Nations organizations, which are equal opportunities for all humanity, the representatives of people of color outnumber white people, so even half of the opinions of white people are not passed. In this world organization representing humanity, people of color account for one-third, so the remaining one-third of white people must rise up. White people are the rulers of the world, and they are still the rulers of the world, but it is difficult to predict how long this ruling position will last.</p>
<h3>Building World Peace on the Basis of Spiritual Morality; Gu Weijun Delivers Revealing Speech at Celebration Banquet for Founder of World YMCA</h3>
<p>[New York Report from Central News Agency, 20th] Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, emphasized the importance of world peace being built on the foundation of emotion and morality. He believes that without this foundation, even effective international collective security measures cannot prevent war and bloodshed. Ambassador Gu's speech was delivered at a banquet celebrating John Mott, a key figure in the World YMCA and winner of the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Gu highly praised Mr. Mott's recognition that relations between countries and nations should be based on morality and spirituality, and his spirit of dedicating his life to this work. Seven heads of state, including Chairman Chiang, sent letters of congratulation to Mott. Mr. Gu added that in the world we currently live in, power politics still has its influence, and suspicion and prejudice still exist in international relations. Therefore, leaders of public opinion should come forward at this time to promote the importance of building world peace on a spiritual and moral foundation. Dr. Mott's dedication to this noble cause throughout his life proves that he should be the supreme leader of this important cause. He also stated that he himself and his compatriots have been greatly influenced by Mr. Mott, and China should thank him deeply. Two generations of young Chinese men and women recognize Mr. Mott as their teacher of hope and guidance in morality. Mr. Mott is the founder of the World Christian YMCA. He has also made significant contributions to the establishment of the Christian YMCA movement in China. He has just returned from Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, so a joint organization of Christian organizations here initiated a banquet to celebrate him.</p>

<h3>On Japan's New Constitution</h3>
<p>...Japanese parliamentarians and the cabinet, as well as the confused Emperor, do not want democracy; they are only doing this to appease MacArthur... (American News)</p>
<p>Owen Lattimore, an American expert on Far Eastern affairs, wrote an article on December 4 on Japan's new constitution, the main points of which are as follows: In Japan's new constitution, we cannot find a single idea that originated from Japanese tradition. The main ideas here are all Anglo-American.</p>
<p>It is true that in order to make Japan a constitutional monarchy, it is necessary to absorb a large amount of British thought. However, the British constitutional monarchy, which is used as a blueprint, has no codified law to examine. Britain only has uncodified law, which includes the procedures and precedents that have evolved over a long history. Therefore, the result of this imitation is very interesting.</p>
<p>The preamble to the constitution begins with a strong American tone: "Government is a sacred trust of the people, from whom its authority is derived and by whom its powers are exercised, and whose welfare is its purpose..." However, this provision does not completely abolish the sacred rights of the "Emperor." Although the Emperor's duties are stipulated as "The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State… deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power," he is still allowed to retain the title of "Emperor." The word "Emperor" clearly refers to the "divinely ordained" or "sacred" emperor.</p>
<p>This dual contradiction reminds us of the fact that although the British King's only task is to issue an edict to the newly elected parliament, he is still called the "by the Grace of God" monarch. However, the difference between Britain and Japan is that everyone in Britain knows that this example of simply expressing loyalty is just a ritual, and this royal power in parliament is only a political event. In Japan, however, in order for ordinary people to be able to recognize the difference between the imperial system's ritual and democratic politics, there must first be several successful general elections and the establishment of many procedures.</p>
<p>The Japanese Diet is organized by the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The two houses should be the active part of the new constitutional mechanism. They are in many ways more similar to the British House of Lords and the American House of Representatives and Senate. The Japanese House of Representatives is elected every four years, but like in Britain, if the government deems it necessary to hold a new general election, the parliament can be dissolved. Senators serve six-year terms, with half of all senators being re-elected every three years. The Senate remains unchanged when the House of Representatives is dissolved, which is also the case in Britain. Furthermore, the Senate can veto bills that have already been passed by the House of Representatives. However, in Britain, if the House of Commons encounters such a situation, as long as it can form a majority pressure, it can ultimately override the House of Lords and implement the bill.</p>
<p>As for the cabinet, which serves as the administrative body in the Japanese constitution, and the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of the cabinet, they also feel more like the British system than the American system. However, on the other hand, the separation of powers of the legislature, executive, and judiciary is very similar to the American system and not like the British system.</p>
<p>The big question at the moment is, to what extent can this constitution, which is patched together from the East and the West, change the actual political forces in Japanese society?</p>
<p>Naturally, no one in Japan today is deceiving themselves into thinking that when a democratic constitution is being drafted, debated, and finally formulated, the current Japanese parliament, cabinet, and the confused Emperor will cater to the trend and do something. The truth is that they do not want democracy; they are only doing this to appease MacArthur.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are already many extremely contentious issues in Japan. The debate on these issues is sufficient to promote the necessary and reasonable process for the constitutional draft to include the real political life of the country. Although the current Japanese parliament is full of reactionaries, discussions on issues such as the Emperor's private property cannot be suppressed. In addition, the correct definition of the Supreme Court's independence from the administrative system and the political rights of workers are also lively and major topics.</p>

<h3>Iranian Kurdish Leader Leads Followers to Flee into Iraq; Tudah Party Declares Not to Participate in Elections</h3>
<p>[Baghdad Report from Reuters, 20th] The so-called "Commander of the Kurdish Republican Army" of Iran, Tahar, led over a hundred households of his tribe, carrying armored vehicles and weapons, to flee into Iraqi territory and surrender to the Iraqi military police. Farbyar Bashi, Deputy Leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party, and seven other leaders of the tribe, who previously fled into Iraq, have been taken into custody by the Iraqi government. Kurdish chieftain Bassani, who is wanted by the Iraqi authorities, previously mutinied on the Iraqi border and is reported to have fled to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Moscow Report from Reuters, 20th] A reporter from the official Soviet news agency reported that the Iranian People's Party (Tudah Party) issued a declaration in Tehran on December 16, stating that under the current circumstances, the party does not intend to participate in the parliamentary elections, and accused reactionaries of obstructing the free activities of the People's Party and the trade unions.</p>
<h3>World Silver: Large Amounts Flow to America, New York Silver Prices Fall</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] Large quantities of silver are being shipped from all over the world to the New York market for sale, resulting in a sudden drop in silver prices here. This silver is coming from China, Spain, London, India, and Middle Eastern countries. Part of it was originally owned by the Soviet Union and was later purchased by Middle Eastern countries and India before being shipped here for resale. Mexico and Canada are also continuing to sell silver to the United States, and despite silver prices being higher in other countries than in the United States, silver continues to concentrate here. For example, the current silver price in Bombay is equivalent to 97 US cents, which is 12 cents higher than here. Several months ago, the silver price in India was 1.30 US dollars per ounce. The sale of large quantities of silver in this market by various countries reflects the desire of silver holders in those countries to exchange it for US dollars to purchase American goods.</p>

<h3>Tea Industry Unable to Bear High Interest Rates; Appeals to Government to Purchase Stored Tea. Five Organizations Held Joint General Meeting of Members Yesterday Afternoon; Elected Representatives to Petition the Capital.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Tea Industry Association, Shanghai Tea Export Trade Association, Shanghai Tea Firm Commercial Association, Shanghai Tea Commercial Association, and Southeast Tea Region Farm and Factory Joint Association held a joint general meeting of members at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of requesting the government to purchase tea. Tang Jisan served as chairman, and representatives presented the plight of the tea industry, emphasizing the necessity of immediate government purchase.</p>
<h3>Summarizing Opinions</h3>
<p>The opinions of the representatives can be summarized as follows: (1) Approximately 200,000 cases of tea (100,000 dan) are stored in Shanghai, with a value of approximately 30 billion national currency, equivalent to 9 million US dollars. However, calculated at the current exchange rate to overseas market prices, it can only be sold for 5 million US dollars. This difference of 4 million US dollars is entirely due to the unreasonable foreign exchange rate regulations. (2) Opinions of export representatives: The reasons for the poor sales of Chinese tea are: Green tea sales have been affected by competition from Japanese tea. Japanese tea sells for only 38 US cents per pound, while Chinese tea needs to sell for 81 US cents per pound. Red tea sales have been affected by the dumping of Indian and Ceylon tea. Indian and Ceylon tea sell for less than 45 US cents per pound overseas, which Chinese tea cannot compete with. The current value of tea stored in Shanghai is approximately 30 billion yuan. After deducting 7 billion yuan of industrial loans, the rest is funded by merchants themselves. If the government cannot purchase it soon, tea merchants will be unable to bear the burden of high-interest loans.</p>
<h3>Southeast Tea Representatives Suggest Two Points</h3>
<p>(3) Opinions of Southeast Region Representatives: Currently, prices have increased 10,000 times, but the exchange rate has only increased 1,000 times, resulting in the actual cost of tea per dan reaching 300,000 yuan, while the selling price is only 80,000 yuan. Currently, half of the tea farmers and tea merchants in the Hangzhou area are unemployed. If the government does not take measures, it will affect production in the interior and cause even more people to lose their jobs. Two points are specifically suggested: (A) Quickly purchase the tea that has already been produced, which must be completed before the end of the lunar year at the latest. (B) Next year's loans should be issued earlier so that tea merchants can prepare for re-production. (4) Opinions of Tea Merchant Representatives: Currently, the purchase price of self-made tea is lower than the purchase price of tea loan tea, which is quite unreasonable, because the cost of self-made tea is higher than that of tea loan tea. It is hoped that the government can handle them equally.</p>
<h3>Proposed Interest Rate Reduction; Exemption from Income Tax on Profits</h3>
<p>(5) The interest rate on silk industry loans is 1.8%, while the interest rate on tea loans is 6%. Both are export goods, but the treatment is different, which is very unfair. It is proposed to request the government to implement interest rate reductions to show fairness. (6) It is heard that according to the Sino-Soviet barter treaty, our country needs to repay the Soviet Union 1.5 million US dollars worth of tea. It was recently learned that the government plans to pay off the debt in cash instead of tea, which is astonishing upon hearing the news. If the inquiry is confirmed, we will argue based on reason, so please pay with physical goods. (7) Recently, there have been many British and American merchants who have ordered tea from us, but due to exchange rate issues, the quoted price is too low and cannot be concluded, so only government purchases can solve the problem. (8) Please ask the government to consider the difficulties of the tea industry and exempt it from income tax on profits to reduce costs. The representatives spoke for two hours. Finally, Sun Xiaocun made a conclusion, the main points of which were: (1) The tea that has been produced this year is less than 200,000 cases, and the foreign demand exceeds this number. The current difficulties of the tea industry are all caused by unreasonable foreign exchange policies, and the tea merchants themselves are not responsible. (2) The government is now striving to reduce imports and increase exports. Looking at the administrative authorities' plans for cotton self-sufficiency and increasing national tobacco production, these are clear examples. Next year may be the "Year of Exports," and the historic Chinese tea should not be ignored. What we have worked hard for in the past is to maintain the export market of Chinese tea, not just our own business problems. The government should recognize this point and not adopt a bargaining attitude towards the tea industry's demands. (3) Only purchasing can solve the problem, because purchasing can unfreeze the tea merchants' funds and prepare for next year's re-production. At the same time, tea in the hands of tea merchants will increase its burden and increase its cost due to the payment of interest. After the government purchases it, the cost can be fixed.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Form Petition Group Passed</h3>
<p>After the speeches, the proposal to organize a petition group was passed by all. According to the principle of including representatives from various regions, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Sun Xiaocun, Ye Shichang, Han Ruoheng, Fan Hejun, Tao Zhensheng, Chen Shoubo, Zheng Peifeng, Qian Liang and other twenty-one people were elected as petition representatives to go to the capital to personally express their grievances to the relevant agencies, request immediate purchase, and discuss matters such as interest rate reduction and tax exemption. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the National Government, requesting the government to consider the future of national tea and export trade, and to allocate 70 billion yuan of national currency as a special fund for the national tea purchase this year, to designate or create appropriate institutions to quickly collect purchases in various tea producing areas according to the cost of various boxed teas.</p>
<h3>Resource Commission Machinery Plant Products Abundant; Bicycles Sell Well on the Beijing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery Plant of the Central Machinery Company of the Resource Commission, since the end of last year, has successively established the First Plant on Guangfu Road and the Second Plant on Tangshan Road and started work. The products of the First Plant are three types: diesel engines, textile machines, and machine tools. Diesel engines are divided into water and land types, ranging from 15 horsepower to 115 horsepower. The former is priced at 5.7 million yuan and is specially used for water pumps and rice milling machines. The latter is priced at 34.625 million yuan, and the sales target is mainly the shipping industry. Spinning machines can be used as carding machines. If each spinning mill runs at 10,000 spindles per hour, it only needs about 35 of these machines. Each machine is priced at 500,000 yuan, and there are about 50 units in production. Machine tools are working mothers, divided into lathes, milling machines, and cold-gas taps, specially for machine factory use. The Second Plant manufactures bicycles, with trademarks divided into wrenches and anchors. Wrenches sell for 240,000 yuan and are Japanese style. Anchors are divided into 300,000, 310,000, 320,000, and 350,000 yuan, etc. Both men's and women's styles are available. The raw materials, except for steel wire pipes, are all supplied domestically, such as brakes and tires. The sales of these bicycles are mainly in Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 3,000 units sold. Current orders are not many. If raw materials are reduced in the future, mass production is planned.</p>
<h3>Report and Prosecute High-Interest Usury; Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Reply to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the rampant high-interest usury in this city, the Municipal Council, after a resolution by the Social Committee, telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to find ways to stop it, and also requested the Ministry of Finance to order the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates. The Council received a telegraphed reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "The Executive Yuan has forwarded your Council's telegram requesting the Ministry to order the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates to the Ministry. According to Article 2 of the Regulations on the Management of Bank Deposit Interest Rates, "Bank deposit interest rates shall not exceed loan interest rates. The maximum limit of loan interest rates shall be determined daily by the local banking industry association based on financial market conditions, including two types: interbank day lending and loan day lending, and shall be reported to the local central bank for approval and announcement." Therefore, bank loan interest rates must not exceed the limits approved and announced by the local central bank. Regarding banks and money shops lending at black interest rates or establishing extra names and demanding extra amounts beyond the approved interest rates, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the central bank to instruct local authorities to be responsible for inspection, pay attention to reporting at any time, and handle them accordingly. In addition, underground money shops engaging in high-interest usury violate Article 345 of the Criminal Law and should be reported for investigation and prosecution. The Ministry has also telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to comply, and telegraphed to the Judicial Administration to notify the courts to assist in the matter, which are all on file. In addition to reporting, please note the matter."</p>
<h3>Ninth District Submits Three Suggestions</h3>
<p>The District People's Representative Assembly of the Ninth District recently submitted three proposals to the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council: (1) Please forward a request to the Municipal Government to instruct all agencies in the city to handle official documents as quickly and comprehensively as possible to enhance administrative efficiency. (2) Please forward a request to the Municipal Health Bureau to establish a public hospital in the western suburbs of Shanghai to provide free medical treatment and medicine to the poor. (3) Please immediately establish a small vegetable market in the Changning District of western Shanghai to improve the city's appearance and facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau's Household Registration Administration Handled by Autonomous Agencies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan stating that the city's household registration agencies are handled by the police bureau due to the regulations of the old Household Registration Law Implementation Rules. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of household registration agencies in the municipal and district offices of directly controlled municipalities and provincial municipalities and provincial capitals, the police bureau also has a household registration section to handle household registration affairs, forming a parallel track and inconsistent powers, which has long been misunderstood by all parties, and it is even more inconvenient to guide and supervise household registration work in urban areas. The revised Household Registration Law and its Implementation Rules were promulgated and implemented by the National Government and the Executive Yuan on January 3 and June 21 this year, respectively. According to Article 6 of the revised Household Registration Law and Articles 3 and 5 of the Household Registration Law Implementation Rules, the Municipal Government should establish a household registration section in the Civil Affairs Bureau. Cities without a Civil Affairs Bureau should establish a household registration section in the Municipal Government. Each district of the city should refer to the townships and towns of the county, with the district head concurrently serving as the household registration director, and establish household registration officers, and establish household registration affairs officers according to the bao, etc. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued separate instructions to be strictly complied with.</p>

<h3>Cold Weather and Low Water Levels in the Yangtze River Make Navigation Difficult; Various Companies Increase Surcharge for Shallow Water</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The weather is severely cold today, and the Yangtze River water levels are shallow, making navigation difficult. Yesterday, the shipping industry in this city received water level reports from various ports along the Yangtze River: Suzhou and Huzhou 6 feet 1 inch, Jiujiang 12 feet, Hankou 10 feet, Yichang 6 feet 0 inches, Changsha 1 foot, and Chongqing 5 feet 5 inches. Therefore, ships above 2,000 tons can only load half of their capacity. In order to compensate for the above losses, various companies have increased the surcharge for shallow water by 30% (based on the original freight rate) according to custom, starting from Wuhu as the starting point, and the downstream is also limited to Wuhu. Ports such as Nanjing and Zhenjiang are not increased, and it has been implemented since the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Holidays Approaching; "Silent Night" Resounds</h3>

Since the middle of the month, stores in the city have been making winter decorations, and women purchasing gifts are constantly on the road. Speculative merchants sell Christmas trees, pricing them according to the length of the tree, at 10,000 yuan per foot. Even ordinary small trees require 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. In the silence of midnight, the song of "Silent Night" is heard from time to time.</p>

<h3>Houses on Zhabu Road Sold at Auction; Ordered to Vacate Within Three Days; Residents of Enemy Property Panic; Representatives Elected to Petition Separately</h3>
<p>Since the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to auction enemy and puppet houses for the second time, most of the residents of various lanes and houses are old tenants. In the midst of the current housing shortage, they are unable to relocate, and bidders are also deeply afraid of causing disputes, so few people inquire. The Central Trust Bureau changed its strategy and first put a small number of houses up for auction, ordering the residents to vacate. A few days ago, the Garrison Headquarters notified residents of No. 421 and No. 425 Zhabu Road, etc., to move out within three days, otherwise it would be enforced, causing panic among all residents living in enemy and puppet houses in the city. Representatives from various lanes were elected and went to the Municipal Government, the Enemy Property Management Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to petition, requesting a stop to the auction and forced relocation. The representatives first went to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM. Mayor Wu was out on official business, so Secretary-General He met with them. He expressed deep sympathy for the suffering of the residents of various lanes and promised to convey it to Mayor Wu. After the representatives left the Municipal Government, they went to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau to petition. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they returned to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu. The Mayor was holding a meeting, so Secretary-General He met with them again. He told the representatives that the petition had been submitted to the Mayor and that the Mayor had sent a letter to the Enemy Property Management Bureau requesting that the original tenants' right to continue leasing the enemy and puppet houses that had already been auctioned be maintained. Regarding the Garrison Headquarters' forced relocation of residents of houses on Zhabu Road, he would convey it to the Mayor for negotiation and would not execute it immediately. The Mayor will do his best to protect the citizens, he said.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Fundraising; Residents Generously Donate</h3>

<p>It is also learned that in addition to radio fundraising and resident donations in various districts, there have been many cases of spontaneous donations. It was also reported that Cao Qingsan and Li Zhengxing picked up a gold ring on the road, and since there was no way to claim it, they exchanged it for 78,600 yuan and donated it to the Winter Relief Committee with a letter. The Committee has replied with a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Renovation of Tianmu Road; Railway Bureau Demolishes Houses to Make Way</h3>

<h3>China Industrial Cooperative Association Works Tirelessly Amidst Difficulties; Gradually Expanded After the Start of the War of Resistance; Financial Shortages Affect Party Affairs Advancement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Industrial Cooperative Association was originally established after the outbreak of the War of Resistance to provide relief to unemployed workers. At that time, factories in Shanghai closed down one after another, and the number of unemployed workers increased daily. Industrial figures in Shanghai, in order to cultivate national strength and support industry, on the one hand, sold or transferred the machines in various factories to the interior, and on the other hand, adopted the method of work-for-relief to organize the Industrial Cooperative Association, so that unemployed workers could obtain reasonable work within a possible range. At that time, the funds were mostly collected from donations from various parties and a portion allocated by the government. After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, it moved to Hankou with the war and formally established the association, electing Kong Xiangxi as chairman. The board of directors had three standing directors, and the association's affairs were mostly decided by the standing board of directors. Below the board of directors were the executive committee and the international committee, which were responsible for business operations and international loans and donations, etc. Because of insufficient financial resources, British and American aid loans became the main source of funds. After 1938, the association gradually moved and expanded, and offices and cooperatives were widely distributed in various provinces in the interior. At the peak, there were about 2,000 cooperatives, with internal organizations similar to small factories. Under the management of the association, it changed from a passive relief undertaking to an active industrial expansion. Offices were established in various provinces in the interior, such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Suiyuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, etc., scattered all over the place, reaching a peak for a time. Later, due to the spread of the war and financial shortages, some cooperatives were destroyed by artillery fire, and some were forced to close. The association supported the remaining situation amidst various difficulties, working tirelessly until victory. Only then did the association move back to Shanghai. According to current statistics, there are only about 1,000 cooperatives left in various provinces. Recently, the association was approved by the Executive Yuan to allocate 100,000 yuan as a fund, but it has not yet been issued. At the same time, many provinces in the recovered areas have contacted the association, requesting to set up offices and cooperatives widely, but due to financial constraints, it is impossible to do so. According to the current situation, maintaining the status quo and enriching the internal organization is already the highest goal. Expansion still depends on the clarity of the domestic situation and the abundance of funds. Recently, some people in the association have advocated moving the headquarters to Hankou, but due to transportation and financial reasons, it cannot be decided for the time being.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Director Embezzles; Petty Thief Captured First; Turns Around and Exposes Mastermind</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Management Committee's Investigation and Sanitation Team received a secret report from a mole last Friday, stating that there were frequent cases of theft of warehouse materials in a certain warehouse at the intersection of Baoding Road and Tangshan Road in the Hongkou District.

Yesterday morning, they mobilized patrol officers to go undercover and wait for arrest in the vicinity of the warehouse. Yesterday morning, a petty thief named Ren Tongqing went to the Xingzhong Warehouse at the intersection of Tanggu Road, acting nervously and suspiciously. When he left the warehouse, it was discovered that he was carrying stolen goods such as Lux soap and bar soap, and he was immediately arrested by undercover police officers on guard. After strict interrogation, he confessed to stealing warehouse materials without denial. He claimed that he was instructed by foreman Wang Ali. In order to investigate the truth of the theft case, the investigation team arrested foreman Wang Ali based on the petty thief's confession. The foreman then confessed to the inside story, stating that it was planned by Sun Nainian, the director of the Xingzhong Warehouse, and that he had stolen warehouse materials several times. It was originally a case of a warehouse director embezzling. In addition to the goods deposited by merchants, there were also some relief materials from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the warehouse. The reorganized team then discussed with the Maritime Police Sub-bureau and arrested Sun Nainian, who will be sent to the Municipal Police Headquarters for investigation and transferred to the judicial authorities for legal action.</p>

The driver, Guo Jingen, 34 years old and a local, was sitting in the vehicle. Suddenly, a drunken US Marine, identified as Kerr Wan Jian, staggered along the Huangpu River bank.

As the truck approached the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, it was stopped by a red light. A police officer, number 4908, hearing the commotion, rushed to the scene. However, the soldier ignored his commands and continued driving, recklessly weaving through traffic at full speed. The officer, disregarding his own safety, jumped into the vehicle. The truck then headed west on Henan Road, crashing into a tricycle with the number 37780 along the way. The police officer was frantic but still unable to stop the driver. Eventually, the truck turned south from Henan Road onto Guangdong Road, then east towards the Bund, where police officers and the driver finally managed to stop it. The soldier was taken into custody, and the American military authorities were immediately notified to send personnel to the scene to take the soldier back for investigation.</p>
<h3>Temporary Housing Permitted on Both Sides of Xizang Road North, North of Xinjiang Road</h3>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ding Qiubin, a 31-year-old accountant from Shaoxing at the Ba Chuan Bank, recently resorted to desperate measures. He used a blank check from a Zhengda Shenzhuang account that had been closed, fraudulently writing a check for 8.6 million Legal Tender dollars in an attempt to obtain cash from the Ba Chuan Bank. Ding meticulously planned the scheme, even forging the seals of the bank tellers Li Falin and Li Ganrong, stamping them on the back of the check. He then discussed the cashing plan with his close friend Li Falin the day before, who in turn passed the check to another friend, Lu Miaoqing, to cash at the bank.

<h3>Another Lawsuit Involving Pre-War Silver Dollar Deposits: Judgment Still Orders Repayment at One Thousand Times the Original Amount. Plaintiff Demands Conversion at Silver Prices, Court Rules No Legal Basis.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A lawsuit demanding repayment of pre-war bank deposits based on the price of silver dollars or standard silver was judged by Judge Dong at 2 PM yesterday. The principal ruling stated: the defendant must repay each plaintiff one million dollars. The plaintiffs' other demands are rejected. The reasoning is summarized as follows: The plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, Shen Cuiling, Shen Meiling, Shen Rongling, and others, deposited 200 silver dollars each at the Zhongnan Bank in the years 19 and 20 of the Republic. At the time, they did not anticipate that the value of currency would depreciate so significantly fifteen years later. If only the original principal and interest of 1,000 dollars were repaid, it would be clearly unfair. However, the government has long since abolished silver dollars, so the demand to repay in silver dollars or convert to the market price of standard silver has no legal basis. Therefore, the court, considering the actual circumstances, has ruled that the defendant, Zhongnan Bank, must repay each of the plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, and others, one million dollars each. This case involves an original amount of 1,000 dollars, but the repayment ordered is one million dollars, which is one thousand times the original amount. This is the third case this year in which the District Court has ruled that pre-war deposit debts must be repaid at one thousand times the original amount. The first case was the lawsuit between Chen Jilin and the Four Banks Savings Society, and the second was the racecourse bond case.</p>
<h3>Two Former Henchmen of the Enemy and Puppet Regime Face Off in Court Over Double-Crossing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Cui Zhanggui, accused of being a detective for the 13th Detective Squad of the puppet Yimiao Police Bureau, allegedly induced Wang Bin’geng to be arrested in October of the 32nd year (note that Wang is also currently detained in prison on suspicion of being a traitor). Cui allegedly accused Wang of murdering the leader of the enemy Japanese military police, Yokota, and Wang was detained at the puppet Security Headquarters for 32 days, where he was subjected to torture. He was released only after the real perpetrator was arrested. Yesterday morning, Cui Zhanggui was tried in the High Court, and Wang Bin’guang was called as a witness. Note that Wang, also known as "Pockmarked A'gen," was previously accused of being a special agent under the command of the rebel Wu Shibao.</p>
<h3>Indictment of Zhan Quangan and Others</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the High Prosecutor's Office, the case of Zhan Quangan, Xue Jingen, Yao Ying, Shen Songping, Zhou Zhenbo, Hu Ganren (also known as Hu Jinren), Song Tiesheng, Feng Wenxiong, and others, suspected of being traitors, has concluded its investigation and they have all been formally indicted.</p>
<h3>Puppet Division Commander Tian Tiefu Escorted to Zhenjiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Tian Tiefu, 34 years old, from Rugao, who served as the commander of the 34th Division of the puppet army, was escorted to Zhenjiang yesterday. This puppet army was stationed in the Rugao, Dongtai areas of northern Jiangsu and the Huzhou area of Zhejiang, where they abused their power under the guise of the enemy Japanese, committing all sorts of atrocities. Since the victory, Tian had been hiding in Shanghai. After being captured by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for handling, the High Court determined that the suspect was a military personnel and should be tried by a military agency. Therefore, because the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command sent Adjutant Ge Weimin to escort the suspect, the High Court yesterday brought Tian from the Shanghai prison and handed him over to Adjutant Ge. Soldiers immediately handcuffed Tian, who was pale-faced, before driving him away by car. It is said that he was escorted to Zhenjiang on the same day to be dealt with according to military law.</p>
<h3>Gu Ruhang Tried Yesterday, Plaintiff Also Suspected of Treason</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Ruhang, the head of the 20th Bao of the first Lianbao in the puppet Putuo district, accused of assisting the enemy and puppet regime and implementing drug policies, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Chen Jigeng, who worked at the enemy's Zhenru Radio Station and allegedly stole light bulbs and wires during his time in a puppet position, was detained, fined, and dismissed from his position. Suspecting that Gu Ruhang had reported him, Chen sued Gu at the High Prosecutor's Office. After investigating, the High Prosecutor's Office determined that Chen was also suspected of treason and filed a joint indictment. After a brief hearing yesterday morning, the court adjourned the case for a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Zheng Jun</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Jun, who served as the captain of the security force in the puppet Fengxian County, falsely claimed that the guerrilla force commander Zhu Che had been arrested by the puppet Security Command and sentenced to ten years in prison during the enemy-puppet period. After the victory, the High Court indicted the suspect on charges of treason for serving in a puppet position. During questioning yesterday afternoon, Zheng Jun claimed that he had originally been a platoon leader in the 94th Army and had been captured by the enemy in Yichang before defecting to the puppet regime. When asked about the allegation that he had accepted a bribe of 100,000 dollars from Zhu Che, he claimed that he had only received 200,000 dollars, which he used to buy shoes and socks for the soldiers in preparation for defection. The court ordered him to provide witnesses to prove this before further review. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Mueller Retried, Insists Employment Was Not Voluntary</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mrs. Mueller, the only woman among the defendants in the Ohard Bureau case, continued her trial in the US Military Tribunal yesterday morning, insisting that she did not voluntarily work for the Japanese. If her superiors at the time, Volkler and Heische, had informed her that cooperating with the Japanese was dangerous, she would never have worked for the Japanese, as she neither understood Japanese nor was afraid of the Japanese soldiers. At the time, she had inquired with Volkler, but Volkler believed that there was no risk and handled everything on her behalf. As for the nature of the Russian telegrams she translated, they covered a wide range of topics, including material supplies, industrial conditions, social situations, agricultural news, inland navigation, private receptions, and financial transactions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mueller also stated that she felt apologetic for the many unfavorable statements she made about Volkler and Heische in her testimony.</p>
<h3>Ten Suspects in Street Vendor Case Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office</h3>

<h3>Reassessment of Housing Tax and Construction Tax Valuations May Be Requested if There Are Concerns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Finance Bureau, in response to concerns expressed by citizens regarding the collection of the autumn housing tax and municipal construction tax, issued the following explanation yesterday: The 26-year rental value listed on the current housing tax payment notice is not the actual rent of the house at that time. In the former International Settlement and former French Concession areas, it is based on the valuations of the former Municipal Council and former French Concession Board of Directors. These valuation records are fully preserved in the Finance Bureau, and citizens can consult them at any time if they have questions. In the former International Settlement area, the Municipal Council, recognizing the unevenness in rental prices for self-occupied and rented houses within its jurisdiction and the possibility of underreporting rental values, hired a valuation committee composed of well-known Chinese and foreign architects in the 29th year of the Republic. The committee surveyed and mapped all buildings in the area on a large scale, and based on the land value and construction cost in the 26th year, as well as the actual rent and the use, location, structure, age, decoration, and internal equipment of the houses, compiled a fair valuation rate for the 26th year. The fair rental value of each house was then determined by multiplying the area of each household's house by the fair valuation rate. This valuation process was extremely cautious, and after the valuations were finalized, each household was notified of the valuation amount and used it as the basis for collecting taxes. At the time, citizens did not object. After the Finance Bureau took over last year, it continued to collect taxes on this basis without any changes. As for the fixed rental value in the former French Concession area in the 26th year, it was estimated by the former French Public Works Board. The Bureau has also been taxing based on this valuation. However, its valuation process is not as detailed as that of the former International Settlement. If citizens believe that this valuation is unfair, they can apply to the Finance Bureau for reassessment. New buildings constructed after the 26th year were also valued according to the above method.</p>
<h3>First Snowfall, Clear Weather Expected Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city experienced its first snowfall yesterday morning around 5 AM. White flakes fluttered in the wind, seemingly adding a beautiful touch to the upcoming Christmas holiday. However, because the ground temperature was relatively high, the snowflakes melted upon contact and stopped quickly. According to the weather station, the center of the cold front reached northern Hubei yesterday and is continuing to move southeast. The weather in the city is expected to be clear today, but the cold will intensify. Furthermore, another anticyclone center has formed over Mongolia. The city will enter another transition period around Christmas. If the cold front advances quickly, there may be more snowfall at that time.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Weather Station's meteorological report is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>A large anticyclone center in western Siberia covers northern China and the entire country, including the nine eastern provinces, Korea, Japan, the East China Sea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the northern South China Sea.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy, freezing, snow around Shandong, strong north wind, moderate to large waves.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Allotted 500 Million in Allied Victory Bonds</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the allocation of the 33rd year Allied Victory Bonds to be raised in the city, the Ministry of Finance had previously approved an amount of 500 million dollars and repeatedly telegraphed the Municipal Government to expedite the fundraising and report by the end of December. The Municipal Finance Bureau has now drafted additional allocations, supplementary allocations, and fundraising amounts, which have been approved at the previous Municipal Council meeting. An additional allocation of 180 million dollars and a supplementary allocation of 220 million dollars will be discussed and allocated by the Finance Bureau in consultation with various industry associations and social organizations in the city. The remaining 100 million dollars will be the responsibility of the various district offices to solicit contributions, which has been divided into six levels of allocation based on the actual situation in each district in consultation with the Civil Affairs Department, with a maximum of 5 million dollars and a minimum of 1 million dollars. Since the Municipal Government is concerned about the economic burden on citizens, it has decided to submit it to the Municipal Council for discussion.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Train Post Office Advances Mail Collection Time</h3>
<p>Since the post office started operating the train post office and sorting mail according to the delivery branches in Beijing and Shanghai, all mail between Beijing and Shanghai can be delivered to the recipient during the first delivery in the morning of the next day. However, the work of the Beijing-Shanghai train post office is more complex, and senders are requested to send mail to Nanjing early. Except on Sundays and holidays, mail should be sent by 7 PM at the latest every day so that the post office can complete the sorting in time.</p>
<p>According to the Manila Post Office, airmail from Shanghai to the United States via Manila is now transferred to other airlines for transport to the United States because Pan American World Airways flights have been suspended.

<h3>Social Services: Reader Inquiries</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Dissolution of Engagement</p>
<p>Peng Qingyuan asks: Man A and woman B were engaged in the 23rd year of the Republic by their parents. They have not yet married. After the war of resistance, A went west with the army and has not been heard from since. In the 30th year, the parents of both parties agreed to dissolve the engagement. Afterwards, A and B went their separate ways. In the autumn of the 31st year, B married man C as his concubine, but no wedding ceremony was held due to the extraordinary circumstances at the time. This spring, A returned from the rear and demanded that his parents recover his fiancée. Since he did not agree to it, he does not recognize the dissolution of the engagement, but his parents refuse his request and want him to marry someone else. But A still objects. Please advise: (1) Is it effective for his father to dissolve the engagement on his behalf after being away for many years? (2) Is the relationship between C and B established as husband and wife? (3) Does C have the right to prevent A and B from communicating? (4) If A and B have improper conduct or run away together, can C accuse A of enticing a married woman and disrupting the family?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Mi Xitong] (1) It depends on whether the dissolution of the engagement at that time met the legal requirements and whether A and B were of age. (2) Marital status is established only after a public wedding ceremony. (3) C has no right to prevent it. (4) C cannot sue.</p>
<p>(2) Refusing to Vacate on Pretext</p>
<p>Huang Qingsheng asks: I have a spare house that was rented to the Zou brothers in August of the 31st year of the Republic through the introduction of Mr. Gu. There were no rental procedures at the time, but it was verbally stated that they were temporarily residing there, and only the two brothers were to reside there. However, the Zou brothers moved in their mother, younger brother, and brother's wife without my consent. Several years have passed. Now that my children have grown up and the house is not enough to distribute, I have repeatedly ordered them to vacate, but they always refuse on the pretext of having nowhere to move. In July of this year, the Zou brothers built four large shanties on Tongbei Road, and they sublet the spare house to others. Now they do not live in my house permanently. Please advise: (1) Is it legal to take back the house for my own use? (2) Is it reasonable for the Zou brothers to refuse to vacate my house when they have built their own shanties for self-occupation and have extra space?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Mi Xitong] (1) If there is concrete proof, you can request a ruling from the competent court. (2) It is unreasonable and inhumane.</p>

Box 500 of this newspaper to receive the medicine. The procedure is extremely simple, greatly benefiting the poor and sick, which is indeed a significant contribution.</p>
<h3>Fu Zhengmo Talks About Conscription: Shanghai Draftees to Enlist in Summer or Autumn Next Year; Integrated Training in Active Duty Units; Provisions for Eligible Women to Serve in the Military Also Exist in Military Service Law</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo (see photo), Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, took the night train yesterday to Nanjing on official business and will then proceed to Chongqing. Before his departure, he told a reporter from this newspaper that the location of the district headquarters has not yet been finalized. Although several sites have been surveyed, the troops currently stationed there have no place to move to either, so the matter must be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. In the future, the headquarters location will ultimately be in the Hongkou or Jiangwan area. Currently, the office is temporarily located in the guest house of the First Supply District Command headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>According to the Military Service Law, eligible draftees are those aged 21 and above. If the number is insufficient, replacements will be made in sequence. The standards for exemption, deferred service, and prohibition from service are all stipulated in the Military Service Law. The qualifications for deferred conscription and deferred recall are handled according to government decrees. The work of investigating household registration and the age of draftees will be assisted by the municipal government. Physical examinations will be conducted by local Shanghai doctors. The standard for qualified Grade A conscripts is a height of 1.61 meters or more and healthy body parts. Those whose height does not meet the standard will serve in the Grade B supplementary service. Examining the physical condition of over 40,000 eligible draftees in the city will take considerable time, so formal drafting and enlistment training will likely occur in the summer or autumn of next year. Commander Fu also stated that the enlisted draftees will be integrated into active duty units for training.</p>
<p>Regarding measures for eligible women to serve in the military, the Shanghai Garrison District currently has no plans to implement them. However, according to the Military Service Law, eligible women may, at their own volition, receive appropriate military auxiliary service education during peacetime and may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary service during wartime.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison District will establish three sections: the first section will handle investigation and training, the second section will handle conscription, and the third section will handle veterans in their hometowns.</p>
<p>Finally, Commander Fu emphasized that the people of this city should understand that conscription is not only a wartime task but should be prepared for during peacetime. To build a nation, we must first build the military; to build the military, we must have military service.</p>

<h3>Rising Tide Sweeps Through the Market: Gold, Paper Money, and Stocks Surge Ahead; Commodities Are Not to Be Outdone; Speculating Capitalists Beaming with Joy; Ordinary Citizens Panic-stricken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news spread that President Bei had gone to Hong Kong, and speculators seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, resulting in an unprecedentedly fierce rising tide. The market opened at 2.41 million with buyers actively bidding. Reports that the exchange rate between foreign currencies and gold to our national currency had not been announced further fueled buying interest. Prices soared immediately after the opening, and the 3.5 million mark was quickly surpassed. As President Bei's trip to Hong Kong triggered more speculative activity, the upward trend intensified. Shortly after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 3.59 million. Subsequently, the price briefly dropped from 3.62 million to around 3.55 million. There was talk of banning new short selling, but buyers continued to demand, one after another. By noon, the price finally approached the 3.7 million mark, hovering between 3.68 million and 3.7 million at lunchtime, up 280,000 from before the closing. Gold jewelry was quoted as high as 3.9 million. Silver dollars continued to rise, and the hidden interest rates became tighter, with interest rates rising to around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also prospered yesterday, with the US dollar opening at 6,500 to 6,700 yuan, gradually climbing higher. By lunchtime, it had risen to over 7,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there was little change, and it remained between 7,000 yuan and 7,200 yuan, up 600 yuan from before the closing. Hong Kong dollars also rose, starting from 1,350 yuan and climbing to 1,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a gain of 120 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 1,300 yuan to 1,350 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,580 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 20,800 yuan. Supply was short of demand, and only the Hong Kong exchange rate saw active trading. Sellers, due to the chaotic situation, were hesitant to act.</p>
<h3>Despite Some Selling Pressure, Chinese Stocks Maintain Their Strong Uptrend</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks rose again yesterday due to the popularity of gold and paper money. There was some selling pressure, and the high prices seemed somewhat relaxed, but the support from gold prices allowed them to stand firm. The market opened higher and continued to climb with gold prices. Numbers 19, 89, and 224 were actively purchased. Water-powered yarn continued to rise to the 700 yuan mark. Numbers 177, 76, 215, and 232 fell back by over ten yuan due to selling pressure, but shortly after, Numbers 185, 89, 211, 83, and 207 rose to their limit, along with Delivered Meiya and Matches, rising to around 705 yuan. Numbers 232, 88, 152, 180, 22, 177, and 152 were sold, causing a drop to below 685 yuan. However, the gold market was even more popular. Number 83 was bought in. Although Numbers 232 and 76 were offered for sale, various odd-lot funds repeatedly participated, and with the support of the gold market, they rose again. Major players, such as Numbers 145, 22, and 84, aggressively bought Meiya, causing Meiya to repeatedly rise to its limit. Delivered water-powered yarn also rallied several times to 715 yuan. Numbers 172, 232, and 207 supplied at high prices, and the market slightly fluctuated at the close. As a result, Delivered Yong Yarn and Xinxing each rose by 10%, Meiya rose by 15%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, Quanxing, and Huafeng each rose by 5%. Cold stocks, such as Matches and Lian'an, rose by 10%. The rest, according to the listed prices, were stable. Delivered Yong Yarn and Xinxing each rose by 10%, Meiya rose by 15%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, Quanxing, and Huafeng each rose by 5%. Off-market stocks rose again.</p>
<p>Following the Trend: Government Bonds Turn Strong</p>
<p>Government bonds also turned strong yesterday. Unified Type C opened at 1,450 yuan, and the low price was 1,400 yuan. Later, following the popularity of the gold market, Rooms 604 and Chengde gradually pushed the price up to 1,600 yuan at the close. As a result, Types A and B each rose by 130 yuan, Type C rose by 200 yuan, Type D rose by 70 yuan, and Type E rose by 150 yuan. Turnover was approximately 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>New Buyers Arrive: Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board</p>
<p>Foreign stocks opened slightly higher yesterday, and new buyers arrived, repeatedly pushing prices higher. Buying interest was very strong. As a result, Ye Guang rose by 20%, and Jardine Matheson, Paper Industry, Shipping Industry, and Steel Industry each rose by 5%. Yisheng and British Union each rose by 10%.</p>
<h3>Under the Frenzied Rise of Gold and Paper Money, Silk Products Are All Boosted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the rise of gold and paper money, silk products were also boosted. Artificial silk No. 120 with the Guangxu brand opened at 3.55 million yuan, and by the close of the noon session, it had retreated slightly to 4.6 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to Thursday. Gaoshan was at 4.3 million yuan, and Dongyang was at 5 million yuan. Semi-gloss was also up around 1 million yuan compared to Thursday. No. 30 Snow Pagoda dull, traded at 6.6 million yuan and 6.7 million yuan in the morning. Although there was ample spot supply in the market, quoted prices did not show any signs of weakness, and factory owners were even more aggressive, quoting consistently higher prices. The market was chaotic, and only one or two loads were traded throughout the day, purchased by manufacturers who needed stock and had to bite the bullet. According to industry insiders, the cost of each load of autumn raw silk is over 6 million yuan, so the rise in factory silk prices is within expectations. The high cost of raw materials invigorated the silk fabric market. Duvet covers were quoted at 900,000 yuan, and checkered crepe sold for 9,000 yuan. Brocade was even more popular, selling for 3,750 yuan. Artificial silk feather yarn was slightly less competitive, with high-end products selling for around 6.5 million.</p>
<p>Central Trust Bureau to Distribute Early Japan-Made Artificial Silk</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Property Management Committee, approved the 18th distribution of artificial silk. Three weaving tape companies were allocated 5.5 boxes of artificial silk, eleven dyeing and weaving companies were allocated 31 boxes, and seventy-four knitting companies were allocated 56.5 boxes. All of the above were early Japan-made artificial silk, with a price of 2.715 million yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Steam Coal Lumps Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>In the coal market, the allocation of steam coal lumps is extremely scarce, and market prices continue to climb in bidding, rising sharply again compared to the previous market. Steam coal scraps are more moderate, also rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. White coal, the Quanhong lumps imported from Hanyang, has already started trading, with each lump selling for 1 million yuan, and transactions at 990,000 yuan were not uncommon. Mixed Hong lumps are still around 900,000 yuan. The Jiao Zuo lumps were voluntarily lowered by sellers by 20,000 yuan to compete. Firewood and charcoal sales continue to be robust, and the market atmosphere is strong.</p>
<h3>Due to a Large Difference from the Reviewed Price, There Are No Formal Transactions in the Rice Market; Oilcakes and Grains Also Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total arrival of over 11,000 shi from the north and south. Prices in various producing areas inland were high, gold was skyrocketing, and people were jittery. Prices for northern and southern japonica were quoted 2,340,000 yuan higher, but due to the large difference from the reviewed price, there were no formal transactions in either the northern or southern markets. Only a small amount of central gate southern japonica was traded. There was no market price for high-quality goods. It was precisely during the Winter Solstice, and sales were brisk, continuing to jump 3,400,000 yuan. Indica rice also saw less trading. By noon, people were less enthusiastic. In the oil market, with the arrival of goods from various routes, breathing was less labored, and factories also supplied. Crude oil increased by 2,300,000 yuan, and soybean oil also rose by 2,300,000 yuan. Qingdili, because prices were already low, stores became more interested and rebounded by 3,400,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also increased by 2,300,000 yuan, and Su oil rose accordingly by 2,000,000 yuan. The sales of flour were quite fragrant, rising again by 1,000 yuan, and bran was also the same, continuing to rise by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes, however, saw little change because sales to other ports were normal. The street was bustling with the sale of soybeans, and prices rose by 300 to 1,000 yuan. However, Pinghu Doudou was average, and Nanyang mung beans were still scarce, rising by 1,000 yuan. Red beans were driven by Shantou and Taiwan, jumping by 3,000 yuan. Red sorghum, due to rising liquor prices, was eagerly purchased by distilleries, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remained stable. Sesame was still handled by Guangdong traders, and the market was solid. Peanut kernels were strengthened by Guangdong's demand, rising again by 1,200 yuan. Wheat continued to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas and pigeon peas continued to be inquired about by Shantou, but there was no supply in the market.</p>
<h3>After the Trade Regulations Were Changed, the Shipment of Film Equipment to China Was Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>It is learned that a large batch of film equipment that China ordered from the United States, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai within the year, has been temporarily delayed by the American side after our government revised the provisional regulations for import and export trade. It is said that the shipment will not commence until the import permit is approved and the quota issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, film equipment in this city, such as cameras and projectors, are currently lacking, especially film. According to a recent survey, the current inventory can only be maintained for a few months, but there is more negative film than positive film. If multiple copies are to be printed, difficulties will inevitably arise.</p>
<h3>Chemical Industry Struggles to Survive</h3>
<p>Of the chemical manufacturing industries in this city, which had over a hundred members before the war, only half remain. Only seven or eight factories can still maintain operations, and the rest are on the verge of collapse. According to industry insiders, many foreign chemical raw materials are currently being imported, making it difficult for domestic products to compete. Furthermore, because the Chinese people believe that chemical raw materials must be purchased from abroad to be reliable, the sales of domestically produced products are even more seriously affected.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Asks Transportation and Management Committee to Relax the Quota on Industrial Raw Materials; Allows Some Factories to Complete Registration Retroactively</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the China National Industry Association held a banquet yesterday at around 5:00 PM at its new location on Xiangyang North Road, inviting Chen Changtong, Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Transportation and Management Committee, Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office, and Xu Xianda, Deputy Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank. Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the Association, Rong Hongyuan (represented by Zhang Mengzhao), Managing Director, Jin Runxiang, Director-General, Zhuang Zhihuan, and Secretary Tian Heqing were all present. During the banquet, the Industrial Association raised two questions, requesting assistance from the committee: (1) When allocating quotas, the industrial raw material category should be based on the recommendations of the industrial sector. (2) The import quota of industrial raw materials should be relaxed and directly allocated to each factory to avoid exploitation by intermediaries. Mr. Li Gan stated that the authorities had already considered the principles raised by the Industrial Association. The government's standpoint is ultimately to consider the interests of the entire industry and commerce and will not profit a few. However, he noted that the circumstances of various industries are different. For example, the cotton spinning industry is relatively simple. Other complex industries will be handled with caution. In short, everything should be done sequentially according to the principles raised. Subsequently, Mr. Chen Changtong stated regarding the first issue raised by the Industrial Association that the Transportation and Management Committee will appoint experts from the industrial and commercial sectors to form a consultative meeting to facilitate consultation and collect diverse opinions.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Runxiang then raised that the import of industrial raw materials is indeed a problem. For example, the foreign exchange for paper pulp cannot be obtained currently. Mr. Li Gan expressed great sympathy for the difficulty in obtaining industrial raw materials. However, he said that the situation is complex, and the most fundamental solution is: (1) to find ways to increase the production of raw materials, and (2) to save the consumption of raw materials. Other than that, there is no fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Finally, the Industrial Association requested that, although factories have already registered directly with the Transportation and Management Committee in order to obtain import qualifications, there are still some factories that have not completed registration before the deadline. They hoped that the Transportation and Management Committee would allow them to complete registration retroactively. Mr. Chen Changtong agreed to submit the request to the committee for discussion.</p>
<h3>Year-End Socializing Increases, Cigarette Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Cigarette prices have skyrocketed recently, and the reasons can be found in both supply and demand. On the supply side, after the implementation of the import permit system, foreign cigarettes have become prohibited import items. Merchants who have goods in hand are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. At the same time, the recent rise in gold prices has also stimulated people's desires. On the demand side, the year-end is approaching, socializing has increased sharply, and the needs of both local and out-of-town areas have suddenly increased, so market prices are high. The monthly cigarette production in this city is estimated by industry insiders to be over 20,000 boxes. Among them, the China Tobacco Company, operated by the Ministry of Economy, ships about 8,000 boxes per month. It is said that the labor unrest has had a considerable impact on production. It is now understood that the labor and management have reached an agreement in principle on the company's year-end bonus issue, but the settlement has not yet been signed. Regarding the possibility of foreign companies, such as the British American Tobacco Company, which is a mainstay, establishing factories in China, the reporter also inquired with relevant people yesterday. It is said that this matter is not simple, because the manufacture of new brand cigarettes in China requires approval from the Goods Tax Bureau. It is questionable whether it can be approved under the current circumstances.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Plans to Organize a Joint Production and Sales Company</h3>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a special committee for the silk weaving industry, after several discussions among the relevant authorities, it will be realized in the near future. This organization is jointly formed by the Central Silk Company, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau, to allocate purchased raw silk and artificial silk to various factories for weaving. The first phase is limited to three months. If the results are good, the second phase will continue. This principle has been decided, but the implementation details still need to be submitted to the Economic Management Bureau for approval before being announced and implemented. It is reported that the Silk Weaving Industry Association is planning to organize the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Stock Company. According to the person in charge of the industry association, the purpose of the planning is to unify the export agency, and it has been approved by the authorities to allocate raw materials. A contract will be formally signed with the Central Bank in the near future. The association issued a notice yesterday, requiring each member factory to use half of the number of machines currently in operation as the number of shares to subscribe to, with each machine accounting for 200,000 yuan, to be paid in one lump sum. When raw materials are allocated in the future, this amount will be used as the standard. It is stipulated that the subscription must be completed before December 23, otherwise, it will be considered a voluntary waiver.</p>
<h3>Gradual Turnaround in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw mixed results. 20-count grass-packed goods, a form of allocated product, were still being resold tirelessly. However, merchants from Beijing and Wuhu and other regions absorbed them at low prices, and gold reached a new high, indicating that the yarn market had the potential to stop falling and start rising. However, due to meager actual sales, the situation presented a lack of upward momentum. The trading prices of each count were roughly the same as on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Handling Plan Expands from Six Points to Eight Points</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a temporary membership meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM, attended by approximately 70 to 80 representatives from various member factories of the association, chaired by Mr. Wang Qiyu. During the meeting, the six points of the cotton yarn handling plan proposed by the government were submitted for detailed discussion. Finally, it was decided to expand them to eight points and submit them to Chairman Wu of the Textile Management Committee to be forwarded to President Song for approval. It is said that if approved, it is expected to be implemented from January 1 next year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a temporary motion was made at the meeting: In order to promptly supply the raw material needs of various factories, the Textile Management Committee should allow cotton import merchants to ship raw cotton to Shanghai and Jilin immediately under the principle of free purchase. A decision was made to inform the Textile Management Committee of this. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar is Short and the Market is Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Association was more chaotic due to the lack of spot goods. For example, Medium sand white and raw sand red had a fluctuation of over 10,000 yuan, but since the 28th batch of Medium sand white, etc., opened a few days ago amounted to over 50,000 bags and the 26th could be shipped, it is hoped that the prices could be lowered. Five-goat coarse white opened at 176,000 yuan, and customers came to buy four or five carriages of white at 186,000 yuan. Shantou ingot was loose, opening at 101,500 yuan. Runde blue was around 100,000 to 97,800 yuan, with 400 to 500 bags traded. The blue-red Diao Qing still opened at 110,000 yuan, and the 3rd Jianbing opened at 225,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cargo Owners Raise Prices; Tea Transactions are Scarce</h3>
<p>Although foreign tea companies had an appetite for the foreign tea market, the bottom stock of Chen Chouzhen and Chen Zhenmei were running low, and the cargo owners raised the prices, resulting in an overall price increase. As for high-end Chen Qi Kai, the British firm Jen Kee &amp; Co. also intended to buy, but there were few suppliers, so the transaction was not formalized. There was no major change in other varieties. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the street and customers were sluggish.</p>
<p>According to the tea industry, the black tea produced in India, Ceylon, and Java has been improving in recent years, and from January 1 next year, it is said that Shanghai will unify the management and restore free trade. It is rumored that a British firm in Shanghai has ordered 20 million pounds from Ceylon to ship to various parts of Europe.</p>
<h3>Domestic Remittance Statistics</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau reported that the amount of remittances from inland to Shanghai in the past two months has been more than that from Shanghai to inland. For example, in October, remittances from inland to Shanghai amounted to over 15 billion yuan, while remittances to inland amounted to only 1.6 billion yuan. In November, remittances from inland to Shanghai amounted to over 25 billion yuan, an increase of 10 billion yuan compared to October, while remittances to inland amounted to only 1.2 billion yuan, a decrease of 400 million yuan compared to October.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Revive and Will Be Dumped in Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>Since the authorities allowed Japan to resume free trade, Japanese white paper has already arrived in Shanghai for dumping. It is now learned that Japanese cotton yarn, toys, clocks, bicycles, chemical products, etc., have also been approved for export. In addition to expanding to the Nanyang market, they will soon be shipped to China for sale. Some are said to be waiting to come to Shanghai. Amidst the flood of American goods, Japanese goods are coming to compete again, not only threatening our endangered industry and commerce but also a disgrace to our country's victory in the war.</p>
<h3>Beiping Garrison Headquarters Convenes Financial Community to Relieve Year-End Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Requests Central Bank to Allocate a Loan of 10 Billion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] The Beiping Garrison Headquarters convened responsible persons from the financial community of Beiping and Tianjin this afternoon to discuss the urgent relief of the year-end financial crisis. It was resolved that the Garrison Headquarters would telegraph the Central Bank's head office requesting a year-end emergency relief loan of 10 billion, which would be allocated by the Beiping and Tianjin branches to commercial loans. The loan-granting banks would then expedite the process and actively handle it.</p>

<h3>Lu Zhiwei Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] Lu Zhiwei, the provost of Yenching University, returned to Beiping this afternoon. It is said that there was no significant budget shortfall.

<h3>Municipal Fishery Association Cables Ministry of Education to Establish a Fisheries College</h3>
<p>After the victory of the war, more than 20 fishery companies were established by the Shanghai Fishery Association. They purchased fishing vessels to operate fisheries, and more than 30 fishing vessels from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have arrived in Shanghai. More will be shipped in the future. The future development is limitless, but our country has always lacked talents in fisheries. Now that the industry is just developing, it is already feeling that there are not enough personnel to allocate, and there is no way to recruit technical personnel for fishing boats. Recently, they sent cables to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, requesting the establishment of a fisheries college in Shanghai, the national fisheries center, to cultivate talents.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education Association to be Established on March 10th Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, which was once highly regarded, has been suspended for a long time.

<h3>University Football League: Fudan and Hujiang Replay Ends in a 2-2 Draw. Absence of Fudan Stars Affects Strength, Hujiang Took Early Lead but Forced into Draw</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the university football league, Fudan and Hujiang replayed their match yesterday afternoon at the John's Field. The referee was Zhuang Yikai, and the linesmen were Zhu Dehui and Chen Zhigang. More than a hundred cheerleaders from both sides came to the stadium to cheer. Fudan's forward Ren Jiagui was injured in the friendly match with the Global Sports Association football team the day before and was unable to participate. Defender Wang Hesheng also did not appear. Therefore, although the offensive was strong, it often had a momentum that was lacking at critical moments, which was a pity. Hujiang was unusually lucky yesterday, with many unexpected and wonderful performances. The whole team played especially hard because they had the opportunity to replay the match. Therefore, they took the lead with a score of 2-0, but in the end, they could not withstand the skillful and rapid offensive of Fudan, and had to share the world equally. The result was 2-2. The first half ended 0-0 with no score.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Between Both Sides Fails to Open the Record</p>
<p>When the whistle sounded, Hujiang first got a corner kick. Zheng Deyao flew up to head the ball, but although it did not score, it scared Fudan into action. The ball then often rotated in front of Hujiang's goal. Wang Dingqiu was distracted and shot too high at first, and then shot even higher. Fan Sijie crossed the ball high, but He Mingbi kicked it off target again. Qian Jiaju kicked three corner kicks, but did not recognize the weather conditions, and they were all blown out of the field by the wind. Fan Sijie kicked two corner kicks, but they were not high enough and were intercepted in the middle. Fudan's offensive was extremely fierce and there were many shooting opportunities, but the ball luck was not good and they did not score, which was a pity. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.</p>
<p>Favorable Weather Conditions Give Hujiang Luck</p>
<p>Changing formations and fighting again, Hujiang sent the ball with the wind, taking a commanding position and using the favorable weather conditions (the John's Field is low in the south and high in the north, and the north wind was strong at the time). In less than five minutes, Tu Biyi flew the ball high into the middle, and Wu Jingren kicked it into the goal, scoring the first goal. Immediately after, Fudan's defender committed a handball inside the boundary, and Hujiang captain Zheng Deyao scored another goal, giving Hujiang an absolute advantage of 2-0. The Hujiang cheerleaders rose to the sound of the whistle. Mi Ji Hujiang's Chen Baogen suffered a leg cramp and fell to the ground, and was carried out. Hujiang general Zhang Fuqi injured his finger, and Zhao Yaozhang was called up.</p>
<p>Taking the Opportunity to Rise, Fudan Retaliates</p>
<p>Fudan took the opportunity to rise up, and there was a fierce battle in front of the Hujiang goal. Xiang Ba got the opportunity to lightly push the ball into the goal, and Fudan's momentum was strong. Later, Wang Dingqiu got a penalty kick, but he was too eager to win and his foot was too heavy, and the ball flew over the goal. Soon after, Qian Jiaju dribbled the ball straight along the edge and suddenly swept it in front of the goal. Just as the ball was about to fall, Fan Sijie turned around and headed it straight into the net, scoring a goal. The two sides tied the score at 2-2. Fan Sijie was embraced by his teammates and returned to the team, which was very exciting and enthusiastic. After this, Fudan's offensive became even tighter, and there were several fierce battles in front of the Hujiang goal, but Hujiang's goal was lucky again and again, turning danger into safety. At this time, Fudan's Xiang Ba had a very wonderful performance, that is, he fell down and hooked the ball from the top of his head, but unfortunately it hit the post and bounced back. As time ran out, the two sides tied with a score of 2-2.</p>

<h3>University Friendship Football Match: Jiaotong Wins Against Datong, Jiaotong Also Wins Basketball Match</h3>

In less than five minutes, right inside forward He Zengli shot in, and Datong's left inside forward Zhu Quanhub headed the ball into his own goal.

The basketball match started next, and Jiaotong won against Datong by a score of 46-26.</p>
<h3>Ninety Minutes of Bitter Fight: Donghua Wins Against Jewish by One Goal, Han Longhai Secured the Victory in the Last Five Minutes</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The Group A football match between Donghua and Jewish was held at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. It was a cold winter day, and there were only a little over a thousand spectators. Jewish was late due to a misunderstanding of the location, and the match started at 2:55 p.m. Unexpectedly, Donghua was in a bitter fight and was often under pressure from Jewish. The first half ended 0-0 with no score. It was not until the last five minutes that Han Longhai rolled into the net with the ball, and Donghua defeated Jewish by a score of 1-0, creating a record of six wins in six matches. The victory was extremely dangerous. The referee yesterday was Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen were Le Xiurong and Huang Ren.</p>
<p>Three Times Not Scoring</p>
<p>Zai Linjing, who had been away from the battlefield for a long time, served as the center forward yesterday. Donghua's offensive was very strong when he came on the field, and there were three very good opportunities, but he did not score each time, which was a pity. Jewish's counterattack repeatedly showed dangerous signs. Once, Han Longbo saved the day, almost staging a fun drama of scoring against his own team. The first half ended 0-0.</p>
<p>Sending Off a Penalty</p>
<p>Donghua repeatedly failed to score, resulting in a boring game. In the second half, Lin Wenhu replaced Li Ning. Five minutes later, Kopstein fouled Li in the penalty area, and the referee Chen Jixiang awarded a penalty kick. The Jews expressed their dissatisfaction, and Han Longhai deliberately kicked the ball off to the side to show "beauty". As time was running out, Donghua still had nothing to gain, and the audience felt sorry for Donghua, because the Group A score was very important.</p>
<p>Last Five Minutes</p>
<p>At thirty-eight minutes, Jewish's Stern broke through three passes in a row and was about to reach Donghua's goal. Yu Qixing and Chi Guozheng were in a hurry and hooked the ball with their feet, actually shooting at their own goal. The Chinese audience was horrified, but it made the fans sweat. In the last five minutes, Donghua's fortune turned around, and Lun sent the ball forward. Li passed the ball to A Sun. At the edge of the goal, the ball actually passed through the enemy's goal. Han Longhai caught up, and rolled into the net with the ball and person. Cheers rose from all around, and Donghua overcame Jewish by a score of 1-0.</p>

<h3>The Cradle of the New Navy</h3>
<p>— Our Qingdao Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Qingdao, 18th Dispatch</p>
<p>From the Liaodong Peninsula in the north to Hainan Island in the south, passing through the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, our national defense line spans the seven provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. In this era where military force is essential for survival, before the War of Resistance, the total tonnage of the navy used for defense was over 44,000 tons, roughly equivalent to the tonnage of one battleship. It was the first to be destroyed by the enemy when the War of Resistance broke out.</p>
<p>However, the new navy has now reached its first anniversary!</p>
<p>A New Foundation</p>
<p>"Backed by Laoshan Mountain, facing the Yellow Sea, and embracing Jiaozhou Bay to the west," this terrain indicates that Qingdao is an outstanding naval base. As Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, stated: "Qingdao's harbor is the best in the Far East." Walking slowly along the tranquil and beautiful Haiyang Road, facing the sea breeze, a startling slogan comes into view: "Without naval defense, there is no national defense!" Behind the wall where the slogan is written, stands a magnificent building. This is the cradle of China's new navy, or rather, "China's Whampoa Military Academy for the Navy" – the Central Naval Training Group's location.</p>
<p>When the United States generously gifted China 271 surplus warships as the foundation for the new navy, a serious question arose: "Who will receive, manage, and operate these many warships?" At that time, Chairman Chiang, after discussing with then-Commander of the Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Barbey, in Chongqing, conceived the seed of the Central Naval Training Group. It was formally established on December 20th, assigning Navy Colonel Lin Xiangguang, who had extensive experience in naval studies and had served as our naval attaché in the United States and the head of the naval department of the Ministry of Military Administration, as its director; and Navy Lieutenant Colonel Chen Zantang as his deputy.</p>
<p>Although the Naval Training Group bears the title "Central," it is actually a joint Sino-American operation. The U.S. Seventh Fleet specifically organized a "Chinese Amphibious Training Group," which they abbreviated as "C.A.T.G.," to jointly oversee training matters. However, they operate under the title of "Advisory Group," with Colonel Cutting as the chief advisor, and Colonel Hibler as his deputy. It has training, medical, supply, and personnel sections, as well as transportation and management units. There are over twenty officers and sixty soldiers in total. The salaries are paid by the U.S. side.</p>
<p>Training Methods</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of all the equipment and materials needed for training are provided by the U.S. side, with a total value exceeding 10 billion legal tender. Our corresponding construction is less than 100 million yuan. The funds allocated by the central government over the past year have also been only 560 million yuan.</p>
<p>The mission of establishing the Naval Training Group determines the training methods. It is a wartime emergency training method modeled after the United States, as the two slogans of the Naval Training Group proclaim: "Train and practice immediately, practice and use immediately." Trainees are selected by the Naval Headquarters, mostly having graduated from naval academies and received basic theoretical education, before being taught the latest operational techniques, enabling them to serve at sea in a short period.</p>
<p>Land Training Phase</p>
<p>Training is divided into "land training" and "ship training" phases. "Land training" sets up various specialized training classes, including navigation, machinery, gunnery, seamanship, electrical, signaling, telecommunications, radar, gyrocompass, gunnery command, and small boat repair and mechanical classes. Each student understands the use of various technologies through models, charts, educational films, and instructors' explanations, so that they can handle them easily in the "ship training" phase. This period lasts from twelve to twenty weeks.</p>
<p>Ship Training</p>
<p>After "land training" is completed, actual ship training begins. This period is very short, from six to eight weeks. After completing the training, these big kids who dream of the sea and dream of one day wearing the beautiful naval uniform realize their ideals and become qualified sailors, serving on the ships where they were trained, their lives closely linked to maritime transport.</p>
<p>"A Ratio of Fifty to Fifty" – Gunner Instructor Lu Zhendan, 25, said: "China and the United States are equally responsible for training. A joint Sino-American meeting is held every Monday to discuss training progress. A joint Sino-English inspection is held every Saturday. At the same time, an examination is held every weekend." The Naval Training Group also has a political department, responsible for educational affairs, headed by Army Major General Tao Guanya, who formerly served as the deputy director of the Third Department of the Political Department.</p>
<p>Trained Officers</p>
<p>Time flies quickly, a year has passed. There have been six graduating classes, totaling 200 officers and 2,000 soldiers, receiving 27 ships donated by the United States, with a total of more than 61,000 tons, exceeding our country's pre-war total naval tonnage of more than 17,000 tons. These ships have been formed into fleets and are patrolling the seas of China. Their silhouettes can also be found in the distant Xisha, Nansha, and Tuansha island groups.</p>
<p>There are still 100 officers and 500 soldiers undergoing training. This is the seventh class.</p>
<p>In addition, the Naval Training Group also has three training classes: (1) Supply Class: training supply personnel. (2) Officer Supplementary Training Class: soldiers promoted to officers are sent back for training. (3) Midshipman Training Class: a batch of students who have just graduated from naval academies receive training here.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Classroom</p>
<p>Lu Zhendan led the reporter to visit various classrooms. In the American prefabricated houses, the future sailors are diligently learning. This is signaling, this is electricity, this is radar... Military science is the synthesis of all sciences, and especially so in the navy. "In the vast expanse of naval knowledge and technology, they may still be a group of elementary school students!" I thought: "But it is already commendable!"</p>
<p>We went to a warship. This is a four-thousand-ton Haskell-class amphibious assault ship, which participated in the Battle of the Philippines and was damaged. It has been received and is now named "Zhongdiao," for "Ship Training" use. I visited every department, stood on the deck, and looked at the vast sea. I entered a dreamlike state, I dreamed that one day this vast sea would be filled with warships flying the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag! But I immediately felt a heavy burden for my thoughts! A comrade on the ship pointed to the radar and told me: "Using this equipment, we can detect whether incoming aircraft are British? Soviet? Japanese?... This is a secret! The Americans didn't teach us this!" He said, smiling self-deprecatingly.</p>
<p>Lifestyle</p>
<p>Naval life is relatively interesting. In addition to eight hours of classes during training, trainees get plenty of entertainment opportunities. They have organized a club, which is well equipped, and movies are shown three times a week. There used to be weekend dances, but perhaps it was considered a bit extravagant, so it was later canceled. In terms of salary, the navy is one level higher than the army. That is, a naval lieutenant is equivalent to an army captain's pay. When serving at sea, there is an additional allowance, amounting to six-tenths of the salary.</p>
<p>A year has passed, it's truly not easy! The 22nd of this month is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Training Group. In this chaotic year, having this foundation in the navy is a source of some comfort, isn't it? However, this anemic infant, drinking American "milk," wearing American "clothes," and playing with American "toys," is still so small. The training of officers and soldiers to receive the 271 surplus American warships will require much effort and time (currently in the first phase, only receiving amphibious assault ships, then receiving supply ships, cruisers, etc.); but when we think of Whampoa in its early days, wasn't it also like a weak sapling? And later, it became the backbone of China's new army! Now we bless it—the new Chinese navy, may it grow stronger!</p>
<p>A portion of the classrooms of the Central Naval Training Group [Land Training] is composed of American prefabricated iron houses (Dispatch from our correspondent Hang Zhou)</p>
<h3>The 11th National Assembly Meeting: Review Report on the Draft Constitution (Continued and Concluded)</h3>
<p>Also, when reviewing Article 26 of the draft constitution, the Muslim representatives and indigenous representatives argued that the election of National Assembly representatives from the ethnic minorities in the border areas should also be explicitly stipulated in this article. After much contention, it was resolved that: "Regarding the ethnic minorities in the border areas (including Muslims and indigenous peoples), to assist their development so that they can enjoy the practical benefits of freedom and equality in political, economic, and educational aspects, it should be clearly stipulated in the fundamental national policy and election chapter of the constitution, reported to the presidium by the conveners of this meeting." When reviewing "Chapter 14: Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution" of the draft constitution, most representatives believed that there should be transitional provisions. After a vote, the following provisions were included in the constitution:</p>
<p>1. Article 151 of the draft constitution is amended to:</p>
<p>"The procedures for implementing this constitution shall be formulated by the National Assembly that drafted the constitution in accordance with the law on procedures for implementing the constitution."</p>
<p>2. Add a new article:</p>
<p>"The National Assembly that drafted the constitution shall be responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution. The term of office of its representatives shall end on the day when the National Assembly established in accordance with this constitution convenes." In addition, the following two points were agreed upon by most representatives:</p>
<p>1. The representative proposed "To establish a committee to supervise the implementation of constitutional governance during the adjournment of the National Assembly that drafted the constitution, and the measures shall be determined separately." The resolution was passed in principle and sent to the comprehensive review committee to determine the measures.</p>
<p>2. Proposed that "The 'Law on Procedures for Implementing the Constitution' mentioned in the amended Article 151 shall be formulated by the National Assembly." The resolution was passed and sent to the comprehensive review committee to determine the measures.</p>
<p>The review work of this committee has been completed, so the more important sections are described above. The attached entire review and amendment of Chapter 3 and Chapter 14 are submitted for public decision by the presidium of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Conveners of the Second Review Committee:</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, Lin Bin, Yi Weijing</p>
<p>Zhang Qiang, Zhu Hongru, Wang Puhan</p>
<p>Zeng Jikuan, Huang Yuren, Liu Zhiping</p>
<p>Review Report of the Third Review Committee</p>
<p>A. Scope of Review: From Chapter 4, President, Articles 36 to 53, Chapter 5, Administration, Articles 54 to 61, Chapter 6, Legislation, Articles 62 to 81.</p>
<p>B. Key Review Points:</p>
<p>1. Countersignature of presidential decrees, 2. Amnesty decrees, 3. Emergency decrees, 4. Consent of the Legislative Yuan for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan. The amendments and more contentious issues are briefly explained as follows.</p>
<p>Before discussing the articles of this chapter, Representative Wang, Representative Xuan, and Representative Chang advocated that Chapter 4 should be changed to the National Government or the Central Government, and that the President, Executive, and Legislative branches should be listed as sections. It was resolved to refer it to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>(1) Countersignature Issue: The original article of Article 38 stated that presidential decrees must be countersigned by the President of the Executive Yuan or the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries. This countersignature power aroused opposition from some people. After some time of discussion, no decision could be made. Only in the last debate, the original article was passed by a majority and sent to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>(2) Amnesty Decree: Article 41 listed the power of "amnesty" among the powers exercised by the President. Some people believed that the power of amnesty had a strong autocratic and feudal color and should be abolished. As a result, the amendment opinion deleted "amnesty."</p>
<p>(3) Emergency Decree: Article 44 listed two factors for the President to issue an emergency decree: one was natural disasters and epidemics, and the other was national finance and economy. After fierce debate, it was believed that natural disasters could include epidemics, and the word "national" need not be added before finance and economy. At the same time, it was pointed out that the most important factor for issuing an emergency decree should be an emergency event</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items on Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's Undefeated Status</p>
<p>This time, with Mei and Cheng performing opposite each other, Cheng won in terms of the total number of tickets sold, but lost in terms of the percentage of seats filled. Moreover, Mei's audience was consistently good every day, while Cheng's was not, sometimes packed and sometimes only 70% full, lacking stability. From this, we can see that Mei's audience is more general, while Cheng's audience has a narrower range. People who watch Mei Lanfang only need Mei Lanfang to be on stage, but those who watch Cheng Yanqiu are more concerned about the specific opera he is performing.</p>
<p>The battle between Cheng Yanqiu and Mei Lanfang was essentially taking advantage of leisure to attack labor (Mei Lanfang had already performed for three periods in Nanjing, Majestic, and Queen theaters, and Cheng Yanqiu had been on stage for many days while Mei Lanfang had been performing in China for quite some time). It should have been easy for Cheng to win, but the reason he hasn't is that he still can't compete with Mei Lanfang's general popularity.</p>
<p>However, in terms of this performance's results, Cheng Yanqiu, although not winning, is not defeated. From Cheng Yanqiu's perspective, it can be considered satisfactory. But if the competition were to be prolonged for a long time, not only would both sides suffer, but Cheng Yanqiu might need to wait a long time before he could return to Shanghai to perform. Otherwise, he would have to put on top-notch operas every day to attract audiences.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying's Misfortune</p>
<p>Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen both seem to have brought bad luck to the old male actors. Since then, the "Four Great Old Male Actors" have been outshone by Mei and Cheng. Although Tan Fuying performed "Zhan Taiping" as the finale once at the Tianchan Theater (with Cheng Yanqiu's "Yutang Chun" as the penultimate performance), it was only once. Now that Cheng Yanqiu is about to leave, he probably won't have another chance to perform the finale. I was in the audience that night of "Zhan Taiping," and the ticket sales were not bad, almost full, or perhaps already full. But the reason why it never became the finale again is likely due to Cheng Yanqiu's unwillingness. The reason why he was allowed to perform it once was due to the conditions promised when Tan Fuying was invited.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying apparently has the status of a second-tier actor at the Tianchan Theater. At the same time, there is also the suspicion of him sharing the second-tier status with Ye Shengian. At least Ye Shengian is a "second and a half" tier actor, not third-tier, because Ye's "Zhenzhou" was once performed before Tan's. But because Tan Fuying often performed on the same stage with Ye Shengian, he always accompanied them by singing "Yellow Crane Tower," "Gathering of Heroes," "Eight Hammering Dogs," "Severed Arm Storytelling," and "Ganlu Temple," none of which are his signature operas. Especially recently, Tan Fuying's dialogue has greatly declined, so "Yellow Crane Tower," "Gathering of Heroes," and "Severed Arm Storytelling" can be said to be his least favorite operas.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying sings "non-signature operas" more often than "signature operas" at the Tianchan Theater.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying can be said to have bad luck.</p>
<p>But his misfortune this time can be said to be self-inflicted. Who told him to sell tickets for 18,000 during the Queen Theater period? If he had sold them for 12,000, I believe that even if Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu sold them for 20,000 today, people wouldn't say their ticket prices were cheap or unreasonable. Perhaps they wouldn't even be selling tickets for 20,000 today, or if they did, perhaps they wouldn't sell as well as they do today.</p>
<p>Yang Baosen's Diminished Color</p>
<p>When Yang Baosen is with Mei Lanfang, people only listen to Mei Lanfang and rarely listen to Yang Baosen. Even though Yang Baosen performs good operas every day, people rarely study his operas.</p>
<p>"Qi Yuan Bao" and "Empty City Stratagem" are Yang Baosen's signature operas, but few people use these two operas as material for after-dinner Peking opera discussions. "Wen Zhaoguan" is his most beautiful opera, perhaps a "swan song" today, but it has never been performed.</p>
<p>Yang Baosen used to be a top star in Shanghai and sold out several times, but why don't his audiences come today?</p>
<p>But he is much better than Tan Fuying, at least he can have his way with...</p>
<p>Isn't this Yang Baosen's bad luck again?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is difficult to have both fame and fortune. It is said that Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen are not bad in terms of "fortune". Isn't the "Tan Yang Incident" another proof?</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou's Sorrow</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou left with great reputation last time, but this time he returns with a damaged reputation. In these few years, he has declined a lot. He is very down and out in Beijing, singing quick scripts of "Eight Immortals Attaining the Tao" with mechanical sets and light bulbs on his head in the Guangde Theater, and he is not even welcomed. This time at the Tianchan Theater, he arrived late, and after arriving, he didn't have any operas assigned to him for several days. The first opera he was assigned was to play Pinggui in "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan," but he temporarily refused because it was a role for a supporting actor, and performing it on the first day would be too demeaning. So the old supporting actor Zhang Chunyan went on stage temporarily.</p>
<p>No one knows whether Wang Shaolou is good or bad. Seeing that his name is listed high above Yuan Shihai, although Cheng Yanqiu's consideration may also be a factor, it seems that he shouldn't be that bad. Who knows if his coming to Shanghai to perform is entirely out of Cheng Yanqiu's consideration.</p>
<p>His first official appearance was in "Qun Ying Hui," where he sang Lu Su and Tan Fuying sang Jiang Gan. Later, he couldn't even sing Lu Su, and after two performances, he "gave" it to Tan Fuying without any compensation. Many people thought that he could sing Qiao Xuan Lu Su in another opera, "Ganlu Temple," to the end, because Tan Fuying was unwilling to sing that role. Who knew that even three days before the performance, he was still not spared, and Qiao Xuan Lu Su was unconditionally given to Song Yusheng, who had already been discarded by the Tianchan Theater. In Cheng Yanqiu's "He Hou Zhuan," it has always been a main old male actor who plays the role. After calculating left and right, it should have been him who played Zhao Kuangyi and sat on the high platform. But for some reason, Cheng Yanqiu also broke the previous record and let the supporting old male actor Li Shilin climb up.</p>
<p>The only thing left is Li Jing in "Hong Fu Zhuan," which he hasn't yet given up. But it looks like Cheng Yanqiu doesn't want to perform that opera again before leaving. Wang Shaolou, when he came on stage this time, shouted that he had no voice and kept his head down, looking very shy. I think it's probably related to "hanging a high name, taking the money, but not being able to perform." Wang Shaolou really has great sorrow!</p>
<p>Kylin Tong's Stubbornness</p>
<p>Kylin Tong has been exceptionally stubborn in recent years. He always believes that his three big characters still have appeal. With him on stage, his fee must be able to compete with any "giant" star, but for his supporting actors, he tries to use "cheap goods" as much as possible. Therefore, every time he goes on stage, it results in a "Zhou Xinfang's script, Kylin Tong makes money" situation. (Zhou Xinfang is Kylin Tong, and Kylin Tong is the mainstay of the Golden Theater and also a major shareholder of the Golden Theater. He uses the real name Zhou Xinfang in his capacity as a shareholder.)</p>
<p>Because his ideals are all wrong, his appeal is far less than before, so the results are always failures. But he is very stubborn and believes that he is absolutely right. The so-called "failure" is the "mother of success." So to this day, he still regards himself as a good medicine to save the Golden Theater from danger. The worst ticket sales at the Golden Theater recently are due to Kylin Tong's stubbornness.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>China Girl</p>
<p>The female protagonist, Miss Yang, is just a foreigner wearing a cheongsam. Hollywood has repeatedly misunderstood China, especially Chinese women. They have made films about Norway, the Soviet Union, and France, but Hollywood should apologize for its depiction of China during the war of resistance. "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth," "Long Live China," and even this "China Girl" all exaggerate Americans into invincible heroes with three heads and six arms, inevitably obliterating the spirit and strength of the Chinese people's struggle. Therefore, even if the screenwriter stands on the side of sympathy for China and depicts the reality of enemy troops massacring innocent civilians, they still inevitably overlook China and are superficial. The structure of the script is chaotic and lacks a central focus. The screenwriter simply doesn't know whether to develop the story of "China Girl" based on the film's title or prepare to express a spy story. If the emphasis is on "China Girl," the spy story is irrelevant and can be deleted. Otherwise, the latter part becomes a farce, which is not in line with the intention of the spy film, which is ridiculous. Under the crude arrangements of the screenwriter, the director has no way to implement, although there are some commendable aspects, it is not a success. The actors are also not outstanding, just so-so, turning it into a C-grade film. Of the whole film, I only remember three points: in the line of people being shot, an old man looking back, a final review of the country under the moonlight, is utterly tragic; and under the great bombing of Kunming, the students sitting calmly and the lovers escaping. Except for these, everything feels exaggerated.</p>
<p>Tears of Rouge</p>
<p>Love is the unique world of women. A woman's life starts from the happiness of her love. Although they are sisters, they take different paths in love, and once they go down that path, there are few days of return. Thinking of the dreams in the boudoir, they are always desolate. "Tears of Rouge" has the three best stereotypes, every laugh and cry is real. In the world of every woman, we can find the shadow of them. Those tears are not only shed for British women, but for women all over the earth. Because it is real, this film has the lightness that is usually missing in British films. Some places are too light, and the director has not tried hard, just passing through the plot, leaving no color, and lacking the sentimentalism in American films. The mood isn't even kept together to make a bright memory. But the screenwriter and director have deep and insightful characterizations, even excessive micro-features. The actors' performances are very stable. James Mason is the leading man in England, his stern and strong personality is fully revealed, no wonder he is very popular in the United States, nicknamed "the Clark Gable of England"; Phyllis Calvert recently won the British Acting Award. Compared to "Blooming Side by Side," she has a new temperament here; the one-sister is delicate and pitiful, the three-sister is beautiful and similar to France's Danielle Darrieux, the brother-in-law's demeanor, each has its own merits. Worth mentioning is the children's play, the three-sister's daughter crying and hiding, and the scene of peeking through the door can be said to be seamless, and perfectly in place.</p>
<p>The Web</p>
<p>G-MAN detective films are outdated, and smart audiences no longer welcome scenes of mass killings, replaced by psychological stimulation. Detective films like "The Train Murder Case" and "Green Window Shadows" are no longer simple detective films, but highly dramatic works. "The Web" takes a similar path. The director is very good at using the camera, and the montage technique is used a lot, but it still cannot make this film concise and smooth, because the script is too complicated, with too much dialogue and too many red herrings, leading the audience to have no way to explore. This film is just a section of glittering mysterious gems, with no shortage of amazing things, the illusion after being attacked with fragrance is one example. Dick Powell has changed his style and is much more experienced. Only he can be said to have succeeded in "The Web"!</p>
<p>Star Spangled Rhythm</p>
<p>A show with a gathering of stars is like a Chinese stir-fry, a mixture of everything. "Star Spangled Rhythm" is one of many old story lines, with no directorial skills or writing intentions whatsoever. Good and bad are swallowed together. People have nothing better to do than join the fun. Elody 林, 克卡遜, and奥丽机地哈苐兰's songs and dances are pretty cute. 娜苏亚 is a unique American singing star, even more popular than 珍妮麦唐纳, with a mellow voice that lives up to her name.埃第康迪 aside from being surrounded by dogs, is too noisy and offensive.瓊兰丝莲's humor is the biggest harvest, and we always have many expectations for her.</p>

<h3>Memories of Hengyang</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tixuan</p>
<p>Hengyang is located in a strategic area, which is a must-win place for military strategists. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the Japanese invaders invaded, and the Tenth Army of Fang Xianjue fought bitterly with them for forty-eight days, causing excessive casualties, and finally became a lair for the Japanese due to running out of ammunition and reinforcements for many years. In this battle, bayonets were crossed, and blue blood formed channels, which was enough to shock the world and move the gods, making it a magnificent and glorious page in the history of the War of Resistance. Now that the sea has calmed down and the mountain is returning to spring, the Hengyang City Council has requested to build a memorial city on that land to symbolize the spirit of our country's resistance to foreign aggression, shine through the ages, and be immortal. The intention is very good. I was reminded of the days when I lived in Chongqing and wrote two chapters of "Remembering Hengyang" to describe the incident. If there are compilers of the poetic history of the War of Resistance, perhaps they can also be used as a source of materials! The poems are recorded later (with a preface):</p>
<p>Since after the Double Fifth Festival of this year (referring to the 33rd year of the Republic of China), the Japanese invaders gathered a large army and attacked Hengyang fiercely, which lasted for more than a month; and the isolated city was defended firmly, and every inch of land was contested. The lunar orb was reborn, brightly seeing the moon of the third day; the whale atmosphere gradually reduced, and the green number seventy-two peaks. The rivers and mountains are effective, and the strong captives will be wiped out; the river will return to me, and the triumphant songs will be played. But the flames of war are in Xiangxiang, and my relatives and friends are thousands of miles away. Sending books does not reach me, and I think of the scales of the carp in the river; I stand alone and ponder, and I look at the flying geese in the sky.</p>
<p>Yueyun became an array to protect the flags, and the sunset isolated city moved away thoughts.</p>
<p>Has the news of the whale cut off been sent for thousands of miles? Several letters were sent late by the returning geese.</p>
<p>The desolate suburbs seem to hear the poor people weeping, and the theater county allows the cunning captives to peek.</p>
<p>Seventy-two peaks are above the sky ruler, and I see the moon like a crescent again tonight.</p>
<p>Ten days ago (referring to the end of July in the 33rd year of the Republic of China), I wrote a poem "Remembering Hengyang", thinking of the bravery of many scholars in Dengpei, and sending the thoughts of the sunset in the isolated city. Fang looked at the tall Qiao mountains, the positive battle of Xiongxiong; I did not expect the demon atmosphere to cover the field, and it became the most of the jackals and tigers. The poor captives poured out their nests, how different is it from one cast; the strong men reported to the country, and they have a thousand autumns to write your dan heart, pay it to the green history.</p>
<p>The isolated city has been surrounded by heavy sieges for more than a month, and I want to see Deng Pei shooting the sunset.</p>
<p>Looking south, Bin Hong was shocked that the letter was broken, and Huma came from the east and was fat in autumn.</p>
<p>Thousands of feet of clouds and mountains support the heavenly pillars, and hundreds of battles in Hunan and Hunan shake the country's prestige.</p>
<p>How can the past be described as Suiyang, and there is still the remaining brilliance of accumulated blood.</p>
<h3>Rambling on Female Writers—Feng Zi Strolling in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Tan Yi</p>
<p>Feng Zi's surname is Feng - this surname seems rarely seen in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. Yes! She is not from Jiangsu or Zhejiang, she was born in Hubei, went to school in Shanghai, but her ancestral home is Guangxi. To this day, her old father and brothers (she is the youngest) still live in Guilin.</p>
<p>This is not a secret, because she went to Guilin to attend her mother's funeral this spring. At that time, she wrote articles about Guilin, and newspapers also carried news of her trip to Guilin. But, if you ignore this fact and only listen to her fluent northern dialect, you will not only not believe that she is a southern girl, but you will also doubt that she was educated in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Speaking of Feng Zi, one cannot help but think of her starring role in "Hometown of White Clouds". Therefore, some people think that Feng Zi is a movie star. In fact, rather than calling her a movie star, it is better to say that she is a drama actress. Because her experience in drama is actually more than in movies. Not only has she recently starred in "Kingdom of Heaven and Spring and Autumn", but when she was studying at Fudan University, she also performed Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm". Later, she went to Japan to perform "Sunrise". During the War of Resistance, in Hong Kong, Guilin, Kunming, and finally in Chongqing, she repeatedly participated in drama work. She wrote a "Strolling Stage," using a prose style to write about her experiences and insights on drama, which was serialized in the drama weekly of Chongqing's Xinmin Evening News.</p>
<p>But the first time she returned to Shanghai after the victory, it was as a female reporter, taking a car from Zhijiang and flying directly to Nanjing. And as the only woman to participate in the surrender ceremony. It turned out that she was already a reporter for Xinmin Newspaper at that time.</p>
<p>Soon, she stopped field work and became the editor of the supplement of the Heping Daily. Later, she also served as the editor of the supplements of the Jinghu Three-Day Journal and the National Afternoon Daily, and at the same time published works in major magazines such as Shanghai Renaissance, Wen Chao Monthly, and Literary Spring and Autumn, but most of what was published were essays. In addition to her debut work "The Silent Singing Girl" published by Zhengyan Publishing House, she also made a second masterpiece.</p>
<p>From drama to film, and from film to female reporter, to supplement editor, to professional writer, it seems to have changed very quickly and a lot. In fact, whether it's film or drama, journalism or editing, whether it's displaying sound and action to the audience or portraying it to the reader with a flowery pen, she has always lived in the atmosphere of literature and art, and she has always lived and worked for literature and art. It's just that the way of performing is different. And with her talent, the screen, the stage, the newspapers, the magazines, are just like the corridor where she freely comes and goes, the grassland where she strolls leisurely. She is like dancing on the keyboard of a piano, and every note is enough to show her genius. Just like her daily life, she can grasp the appropriate position everywhere and capture the elite at the forefront of life. When something is not yet mature, she will never reveal a word even in front of her best friends. When victory first came, everyone was running around for transportation, and when friends met, they always asked each other if they had any solutions, but five minutes before she got into the car to Zhijiang to take the plane, she still hadn't told her friends that she had found a way. The same was true of going from Shanghai to Guilin.</p>
<p>Some people think that Feng Zi's actions are a bit mysterious, but it is just a part of her personality. In good conscience, she didn't mean to hide it from you. So, if we suddenly hear that Feng Zi has gone to the United States on a regular basis recently, or when the news reaches our ears, her ship has already passed Honolulu, there is no need to be surprised.</p>
<h3>Scenery</h3>
<p>— Ke Luo</p>
<p>Corot (J.B. Camille Corot 1796-1875) was a famous landscape painter of the 19th century. He lived in Barbizon Village with Millet, so historians called them the Barbizon School. He was not only good at landscapes, but also at portraits. His paintings are natural and poetic. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Homecoming Poetry Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Lu Baihua</p>
<p>The Great Buddha is Safe</p>
<p>When discussing the famous mountains in my hometown, although Li Taibai praised the majesty of Mount Tianmu, it is too far away from the city after all. It can be said that I have never been there since I was born, and it is said that it is not surprising. The flat-like hills, chaotic rocks and weeds, and the stele of "Li Bai Dreaming" exist, but they ultimately belong to the poet fairy's fantasy. The famous mountain is Nanming Mountain, five miles west of the city. There is "Dafosi (Great Buddha Temple)" on the mountain, which is indeed the first scenic spot in Zhejiang. Those who travel in eastern Zhejiang must visit our place to admire the Great Buddha. The history of the Great Buddha is very early. During the Five Dynasties, a wandering monk came to Nanming Mountain and made a vow to carve a stone Buddha ten feet high on Feiyan Cliff. Naturally, this was not something that could be accomplished in a short "decades". The monk died, and his disciples continued to carve, even after the third generation of disciples, and with the million-string assistance of King Qian Liu of Yue, this majestic stone Buddha sitting in the rock wall was completed. There is a well-sized hole in the top of the Buddha, which is connected to the water flowing deep in the window, because the main hall is paved with stone slabs, and the bottom is full of water. A pair of couplets at the gate of the hall is very accurate: "Ten feet of golden body opens the green wall, a thousand years of stone gaps spill cold sound". This makes it a good place to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>The road to Dafosi was originally a mountain road, going straight up to Cuilang Pavilion, then turning east and going down to the mountain gate. Later, Zhang Zaiyang opened another highway. At that time, he was the governor of Zhejiang Province. He was a native of Xinchang, so naturally he wanted to promote the reputation of his hometown. After the completion of the highway, a row of Western-style houses was built opposite the temple, with the words "New Society" inscribed on them. His calligraphy was fat and round, and he was like a magpie's nest. He didn't visit himself, and he was allowed to be a place for the villagers to travel and rest. I still remember deeply that when I was a child, I almost went to Dafosi to play whenever I wanted, and I always liked to take the mountain road. Now, I and Zongen have come again. This is the most gratifying thing about my homecoming. Yes, my plan to return to my hometown is to revisit Nanming Mountain.</p>
<p>We left the South Gate and circled the city westwards. The clear and shallow water of the dike is still active with the childlike innocence of catching shrimp with a bottle. Zongen told me how he had walked under this with fear, passing the enemy's sentry post on the top of the mountain, on the night when he returned to his hometown to visit relatives while taking a break from being the magistrate of Fujian. I was silent, he was so difficult and great, and I, exhausted my pen, and achieved nothing. At the end of the dike, there is a mountain road, which is a winding and slanting stone step. The original state of the "East Yue Temple" cannot be found, only the broken clay statues are buried in the weeds. The mountain road became steeper, passing a cliff, it is said that the talented Luo Yin had been here! Calling its name will respond, which shows the naivety of the mountain city, and even the principle of empty valley echoes is not understood. Going up again is the "Cuilang Pavilion", we sat for a while, and felt that the complaints in our stomachs were washed away by the waves of the surrounding mountains and forests.</p>
<p>The stone steps that turn east and descend are difficult to walk on, in the middle of the cliff, narrow and slippery, but the mountain gate has also arrived. With a swoosh, a squirrel flashed under the horizontal pine branches, and the boundless green was rippling with clothes, and I felt refreshed. Inside the mountain gate, on the other side of the stone monument of "Nanming Shengjing" inscribed by Mi Fu, there is also a monument of "Tianzhuyiran", which is said to have been inscribed by Zhu Zi, because there is "Zhu Zi Reading Place" on it, and Canglang Pavilion enshrines the statue of Zhu Zi, which we also admired. A pair of couplets in front of the pavilion is wonderful: "Sun and Moon double wheels, heaven and earth eyes, poetry and books, hundreds of generations of sages and hearts." After that, we arrived at Dafosi, the Great Buddha is safe, but the golden body is much dimmer.</p>
<p>The light of the slanting pine reflects the squirrel,</p>
<p>The echo of the cliff calls the talented;</p>
<p>The mountain in front of Cuilang Pavilion is like a sword,</p>
<p>The thorns in the chest are temporarily opened.</p>
<p>The stalwart divide and support the pillar of the sky,</p>
<p>After singing Canglang, leave a stone inscription;</p>
<p>The Dharma eye and Confucian heart are shared for thousands of years,</p>
<p>Listen to the birds singing on Nanming Mountain!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 129</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>From Yuanzi's exploration, copies of both ordinary domestic and confidential international documents were kept in this study. As for the "Seven Sealed Letters," since she received the order, on this morning, within a few hours, by a lucky coincidence, she risked entering the study again. After searching, she was certain that they were stored in the basement. Whether they were the originals, copies, or both original and copies, she didn't know.</p>
<p>Why not simply risk exploring the basement? This was impossible, not only due to time constraints but because the basement had only one entrance. Perhaps there were also "mechanisms" with electric shock messages. Aside from Konoe himself, even the several confidential concubines who managed the study were said never to have gone down there. How could Yuanzi enter alone?</p>
<p>Then, how did she determine that the "Seven Sealed Letters" were definitely hidden in this basement? This wasn't Yuanzi's fantasy or speculation, but based on inferences from conversations with those confidential concubines. In advanced spy training, there was a subject on deduction and understanding. For places that couldn't be personally inspected, exploring their secret contents relied entirely on conjecture using deductive methods, like arithmetic or chemical analysis. To find an unknown quantity, you trace back from known points. To find an unknown element, you analyze with known reagents. While this method wasn't 100% reliable, it was 99% justifiable. International master spies could estimate troop and ammunition numbers, and operational goals, directions, etc., based solely on the train's travel time, frequency, and speed. This was one such method.</p>
<p>In the car, after listening to Yezhu's report on Yuanzi's work, Tsurumi asked for clarification on several key points. He had already formed a rough plan for exploring the "Seven Sealed Letters" in his mind. He only needed to get to Tokyo, discuss it with a few capable subordinates, and then announce the execution.</p>
<p>Although it sounded simple, the task was actually extremely difficult. First, the nature of the task was unusually fragile, like extracting a detonator from a two-ton bomb. One wrong move, and everything would be destroyed. The fragility lay in the need to accomplish the task without anyone noticing. They couldn't take the original and leave no trace of tampering. Otherwise, before the "Sealed Letters" were revealed, these devils would have already found a way to cover their tracks, or come up with other countermeasures, moving the "Sealed Letters" secretively, causing international supporters of justice and the general public to be confused and dubious. Then, even if revealed, it would be ineffective, a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Second, although Tsurumi was in charge of this task, he couldn't be exposed. In other words, he was only allowed to succeed, not to be discovered. Because after doing this, he had to maintain his current advantageous position and continue working until the war demons' plans were completely shattered and the world's war completely extinguished. Therefore, this matter had to be done without anyone noticing to be considered a success.</p>
<p>The nature of the matter was so fragile that it couldn't be done like other spies stealing secret documents or blueprints, forcefully and then running away. At the same time, it was necessary to consider that this item was placed in such a heavily guarded place with multiple layers of protection. Needless to say, there were Bufu's guards on the surface and confidential concubines specifically supervising it. These confidential concubines might be beautiful and gentle, but they shouldn't be underestimated. Take Yuanzi, for example. Not only was she clever and alert, but she could also use knives and guns. They were all fierce characters selected from hundreds, one in a thousand. Otherwise, why would Konoe put them in such important positions?</p>

<h3>Car</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A "Biegu Brand" car costs twenty gold bars. Even Xiao Xing's "Fiat" costs eight. The car class's status is different today.</p>
<p>A friend complained: "How can I willingly hide my talents? It's just that I don't have a car." So he listed reasons: "For example, after a meeting, walking out of the gate, others stand there imposing. 'Ford,' 'Shunfeng,' 'Chrysler,' glide from afar. Sometimes there are even burly bodyguards in special cars. They either slowly and leisurely step inside with an air of grandeur, or politely say to you, 'Let's go together'? 'Take my car'?" It can't help but make one think, "What a man does, so do I." Even if it rains and the road is slippery, you deserve to get wet. Either you catch a cold on a tricycle or sweat on the tram.</p>
<p>As for visiting friends, Jiangwan Road, Daxi Road, Xujiahui, are all in different directions. Not being a flying leg, it's better to save it."</p>
<p>My friend's words have merit. In Shanghai, you can't make a name for yourself without a car. People say there's gold everywhere on the streets, but you have to walk out to have a chance to pick it up. But how can a running friend have more chances to pick it up than the car class!</p>
<h3>Thief Swallows Watch, Big Shots Swallow Gold</h3>
<p>— Jia Xuezhen</p>
<p>Same swallowing, different methods</p>
<p>In the newspaper on the 16th, there was a local news story about a thief who stole a watch from a watch shop and swallowed it. He almost got away with it. Later, after a policeman slapped him on the cheek, he finally spat out the loot, and both the person and the goods were caught.</p>
<p>This news made me realize that the progress of Shanghai thieves' skills is truly remarkable. But I still feel that this thief is one step behind: money, though small, is still difficult to swallow. Only gold is truly satisfactory. If you can't hold it in your mouth, you simply swallow it. If you're lucky, you can pick it up from the stool the next day and still use it. Perhaps he was always afraid that, in the event of misfortune, it would cost him his life. Therefore, he would rather work with the watch than joke with life. In fact, this is worrying for nothing. Look at how many big shots who specialize in swallowing gold bars are still swallowing today?</p>
<p>However, I have to say that their skills are indeed beyond the reach of the thieves. Even if their mouths are filled with gold, they can still give very pleasing and unnoticeable high-sounding theories. So they are guaranteed to have no danger of dying from swallowing. At the same time, the hands of the police will never visit their cheeks. They have no life-threatening danger or worries. So long live the big shots who swallow gold!</p>
<p>But someone asked me, what if one day, the big shots were forced to swallow the gold? There is probably a cure, I think. It is said that there is a medicine—also made of gold—that can make the swallowed gold come out with the stool, ensuring no danger to life. And the gold in the stool, although stinking, can still allow them to eat big dishes and build foreign houses...</p>
<p>Officers, be brave, raise your noble hands and slap the cheeks of these big shots. They will immediately open their blood basins like big mouths, and the yellow-gold will spill all over the ground!</p>

<h3>Respected Elder, Nankai Principal Zhang Boling</h3>
<p>— Zhengfan</p>
<p>With a tall stature, purplish-red face, gray-white flat top, wearing a pair of glasses, holding a cane, the typical "Tianjin big belly," our Zhang Boling Guang-sheng has returned from the United States. Although he is over seventy years old, he still has the air of a "Yan Zhao Brave Warrior."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is a believer in old-style marriage. He said: "New-style marriages are too slick. Vanity is more important than any theory. They only know how to bury their heads and do things, but it's much better than being able to talk and write but not do. Moreover, new-style marriages are easy to divorce. If there is a disagreement, they fly away separately. Unlike old-style marriages where 'this road is blocked,' everyone has to give way, and then there is no problem."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Zhang is "practicing what he preaches." He and his wife, Ms. Wang Shuzhen, have always been a famous model couple. In 1935, Nankai alumni held a grand celebration for Principal Zhang's 40th wedding anniversary. Because it was ten years away from the "golden wedding," Mr. Zhang called himself a "gilded wedding." According to him, he and his wife had never had an argument. His career was all thanks to his illiterate wife. He calls his wife "Hey!"</p>
<p>Zhang's indomitable spirit is due to congenital heredity. His father was a poor scholar in Tianjin, played the pipa, and was known as "Pipa Zhang." His younger brother, Pengchun, was one of the most vigorous advocates of Chinese drama.</p>
<p>When Mr. Zhang was a child, he studied at the Beiyang Naval Academy, determined to be a naval hero. Later, he felt that the Chinese nation's knowledge was shallow and its body was bad, so he decided to abandon the navy and pursue education. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Yan Fansun set up a private school in Tianjin and invited Mr. Zhang to be a professor of physics, chemistry, English, and mathematics. That private school became the prototype of today's famous Nankai University.</p>
<p>When Nankai first opened, there were only more than 70 students. However, under Mr. Zhang's difficult management, the school's career gradually developed from a private school to a primary school, middle school, girls' school, university, and research institute. Since its founding, it has cultivated countless talents.</p>
<p>At Nankai, he would get up at 6:00 every morning and walk around the school, planning how to improve the school. He is not good at rhetoric, but his speech is kind and simple. He often said this sentence: "Nankai's specialty is growing, growing, growing. It's always growing!"</p>
<p>Zhang Guangsheng has always held a detached attitude towards politics, "If my way is not followed, I will embark on a raft and float on the sea," not enthusiastic, not participating. But during the Anti-Japanese War, he resolutely led his students into the great era of resistance and construction. He was elected vice chairman of the National Political Council. He could endure hardship and resentment, always working hard, doing practical work, and working hard!</p>
<p>His whole life has been devoted to education. He only asks for cultivation, not harvest, unremittingly and tirelessly, with a radiant spirit, making us feel that Mr. Zhang Boling is getting younger and younger!</p>
<h3>Rapidly Declining Years</h3>
<p>— Wangwu</p>
<p>Merchant A: In these rapidly declining years, what kind of business is good?</p>
<p>Merchant B: I think it's still best to sell coarse hemp rope, DDT. Come and kill...</p>
<p>Merchant A: What does that mean?</p>
<p>Merchant B: It's to make things convenient for everyone!</p>
<h3>Pre-War Deposits</h3>
<p>— Cai</p>
<p>The bank does not take care of deposits, not because it is bankrupt and does not take care of deposits, but because it does not take care of deposits before the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Speaking of this bank, isn't it an above-average bank, and can be considered "highly reputable" in Hangzhou? It is located on Qiaotou Road and has a self-built foreign house, which is quite magnificent, namely the "Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank."</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, the author saved money and deposited 30 yuan per month in so-called "fixed deposits." I deposited this way continuously for five years. Suddenly, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. During these five years, in order to maintain deposit credibility, sometimes when I didn't have money to deposit, I raised money by taking clothes, in short, I put it together and pieced it in, and I never delayed a day. All I hoped for was a small amount of interest.</p>
<p>After August 13th, the bank swept everything away and fled to Jinhua, transferred to Zhongxi, and can be said to have not suffered the slightest damage. The Hangzhou branch site is still complete, so at the beginning of the victory, it was the first to ask about the resumption of business, and it has been a year and four months now.</p>
<p>The "Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank" has not yet indicated that it will clear pre-war deposits. The author personally went to inquire several times, and each answer was off-topic. Recently, I was told "I'll talk about it later." Later is indefinitely remote, a thousand years, ten thousand years, just "not return" it.</p>
<p>The author's relatives and friends are all "depositors" of the bank. However, because the deposit numbers seem extremely small now, honestly, it's not worth suing; however, if we just let it go, then, isn't it too cheap for this big bank? I'm afraid there are countless depositors like me.</p>

<h3>Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law (Part 2) Collective Opinion</h3>
<p>Marriage Revolution</p>
<p>"Men marry women," the traditional marriage system with thousands of years of history, is of course difficult to change, but if it can be reversed, it will definitely reduce more than 90% of the irreconcilable disputes between families.</p>
<p>How to change it? It is to reverse "marrying off daughters" to "marrying off sons" and "taking daughters-in-law" to "taking sons-in-law."</p>
<p>Daughters stay at home, and when they reach marriageable age, they will marry a husband for her. When the sons reach adulthood, they will marry into the wife's family. In this way, the mother and daughter will naturally live together and get along well, and it will not easily cause trauma and rifts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. One daughter is of course no problem, even if there are three or four sisters, it doesn't matter, because sisters have the same interests and temperaments, which are generally the same. Compared with sisters-in-law, sisters-in-law, and mothers-in-law of different surnames, it is naturally easier to get along and not be jealous. In addition, on the basis of flesh and blood, they can cooperate and understand each other, and the family will naturally be harmonious.</p>
<p>As for mothers-in-law always loving their sons-in-law, and sons are always more likely to make a living outside, spending less time at home. After a long absence, the mother-in-law and son-in-law feel particularly close. If there are three or five brothers-in-law, it is also because each person spends more time outside and less time gathering. Reuniting during the New Year and festivals, they are naturally more cordial after a long absence, and will never argue and be incompatible like sisters-in-law who live together all day long.</p>
<p>If the mother-in-law's family has sons, of course those who are adults will marry out. Those who are still young and stay at home naturally have nothing to say when they are with their sisters, and they are still loving and harmonious with their brothers-in-law because they do not see each other all the time.</p>
<p>In this way, there is no such thing as mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, so the whole family is happy.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone will agree with this absurd (?) ideal of changing the marriage system? (Yijin)</p>
<p>My Mother-in-Law</p>
<p>My mother-in-law, who is nearly sixty years old, is a kind and approachable person. She is very kind to people, whether they are neighbors or relatives and friends. I get along very well with her. She is very considerate of me. When I am busy with housework, she always helps from the side. As for me, I think of her as old and should not be too tired, so I mostly rush to do everything in front.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten what my husband said to me on the day of our wedding five years ago: "Qi-mei! My home is your home. Being filial to my mother is like respecting me. Raising children to prevent old age, accumulating grain to prevent famine. I leave the affairs of the family to you. With you, I can rest assured and there are no worries about internal affairs."</p>
<p>My mother-in-law is a devout Buddhist. She burns incense, lights candles, eats vegetarian food, and recites Buddha every lunar first and fifteenth day... It is her routine. I guess her original intention is nothing more than to ask the gods and Buddhas to bestow blessings and hope that the whole family will always be healthy and that everything will go smoothly. Everyone is free to believe in religion, but she seems to be a little too much, bordering on superstition. In the family, no matter who gets sick, she is very anxious. If the cold and fever do not go away in a day or two, she will buy a long ingot and burn it. She says that the patient has encountered "Chi Lao"—referring to a ghost—and it will be fine after sending it away; or go to the temple to burn incense, ask for a divination, and bring back a few packs of incense ash and tell the patient to take "spiritual medicine." But I know that this "spiritual medicine"—incense ash—is harmful to the disease, but I am embarrassed to disagree in front of her, so I "comply outwardly and disobey inwardly" and secretly discard it, and at the same time ask a doctor for treatment.</p>
<p>Because of this, she does not hold hostile views towards me. We are very good. (Zhu Yunqi)</p>
<p>Not a Joke</p>
<p>There is a story in my hometown that is told as a "joke." It is said that a widow, her only son is very filial, on the night of her son's wedding, this mother-in-law unexpectedly moved to sleep on the young couple's new bed, and built a pile of isolated "barriers" between the two, which was very embarrassing for her son and daughter-in-law for a long time. I think this is definitely not a completely absurd "joke" but a very profound allegory. (Jingtian)</p>
<p>Son's Depression</p>
<p>The discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law undoubtedly distresses those who are "mother's son" and "wife's husband."</p>
<p>In order not to be a suspect of "marrying a daughter-in-law and losing my mother" or "mother and son jointly abusing the daughter-in-law", I was plunged into a deep abyss of extreme pain; therefore, my will was very depressed, and even lifeless, I repeatedly wanted to destroy myself, and leave this "hell-like" home forever, to go to another world.</p>
<p>To eliminate the "discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," the most thorough way is to separate. But the problem comes, try to imagine in this "inch of gold" and the difficult life in the city, how can it be done? Even if it is possible, the environment is not allowed! Because according to convention, when the daughter-in-law enters the door, the mother-in-law can unload her responsibilities to enjoy Qingfu and wear away the remaining years. Moreover, it is still questionable whether the mother-in-law is willing to live a lonely life? So the separation of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is also a problem in Chinese families. (Xiangsheng)</p>
<p>I'm a Mother-in-Law</p>
<p>I am a young mother-in-law, and I sympathize very much with the misunderstood young daughters-in-law. I think a mother-in-law should have a basic understanding: the son is not property. My upbringing of my son is equal to my parents' upbringing of me. The kindness my parents gave me, I did not fully repay my parents, but repaid it to my next generation. I regard the continuation of the family as the continuation of the life of the whole human being. I think that the sweet love between son and daughter-in-law is reasonable and natural, and there is no need to be jealous. I am getting old, and my responsibility to him (them) is over. Precisely because it is a responsibility, I do not haggle about what I get from my son and daughter-in-law. (Hongguo)</p>
