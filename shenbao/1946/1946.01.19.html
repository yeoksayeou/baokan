<p>〔聯合社重慶十八日電〕政治協商會議今日開會，對於本年五月五日召開國民代表大會預定計劃，未予贊同。當交由小組委員會處理。中共代表周恩來，反對大會現行組織法，共黨曾稱大會充滿國民黨代表。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶十八日電〕政治協商會議，對於一九三七年當選國民大會代表之有效與合法問題，今日有熱烈之辯論，大約將由小組委員會決定一妥協辦法，以增加各黨各派之代表名額。最後一次大會，將於明日舉行，屆時將通過憲法草案。小組委員會將提出政協會議五大綱要之審查報告，預料大會將予以通過。共黨代表周恩來反對舊代表，但稱：「不願因此危及全國團結」，如問題不能解決時，「願作相當讓步」。民主同盟代表羅隆基，提議以投票方法，決定國民大會代表是否需要重選。渠要求舊候選人舉行普遍選舉，新憲法舉行公民投票。國民黨代表陳立夫謂一黨統治正式肇始於一九二四年，今則已吿結束矣。渠指出：英國國會在戰爭期間繼續開會，從未停頓。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中國共產黨今日向政治協商會議，提出中國立憲之計劃，共分十點，主張各黨在蔣主席領導之下成立一人民自由與民主之全國政府，並從事農業，財政，教育與工業之改革。昨日國共兩黨對於國民大會代表一層發生意見分歧後，協商會議即開始討論憲法。中央政府擬召集十年前選出之國民大會代表，共產黨方面則謂應選舉新代表，然後國民黨之訓政始可結束。共產黨對於憲法之決議中要求：（一）從速在蔣主席之下成立立憲政府，將政治民主化，軍隊國家化，各黨均應予以平等之合法地位。（二）人民自由之保障。（三）擴大政府。（四）選舉國民大會新代表。（五）地方自治政府。（六）全國軍事委員會予以改組，軍令統一。（七）立即復員與復興。（八）財政與經濟改革。（九）文化與教育改革以消滅文盲。（十）與各國締結條約，以促進國際和平。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十七日電〕軍事考察團，國民參政會方面應推選之團員，續由參政會駐會委員會於下次例會前召集臨時會議推定。出發日期，政治協商會議之團員，與參政會將推之團員並非全部，在渝恐尚須稍待時日。至於考察詳細辦法，迄未正式接到書面通知。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津十八日電〕莫德惠十八日午自平抵津，稍事躭擱，即返平赴渝。</p>
<h3>調處部三組出發　分飛往集寗赤峯濟南工作</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕（一）軍事調處執行部，今日預定有三和平小組，分飛集寗·赤峯·濟南。據十二戰區消息：共軍十五日仍猛攻綏東集寗縣城，共方人員則稱：杜聿明將軍所部，繼續西進，赤峯附近，正展開激烈戰鬥。故執部派人前往調處。（二）執行部連日均有會議，惟尚未遷入協和醫院正式辦公，該部定十八日下午四時，招待記者。（三）共方昨由張家口飛來一批工作人員，惟仍感人手不敷，致難即日正式辦公。（四）執行部設新聞組，美方代表布瑞田，政府代表為國際宣傳處資格極老之科長季澤晉，共方代表為新華日報外交記者　澎小姐。　在渝素活躍於國際宣傳處之外籍記者間。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南十八日電〕軍事調處執行部濟南執行小組雷克上校，軍令部上校參謀塗叔五，中共代表馬金橋，偕同隨員共十二人，於十八日下午一時半由平飛抵濟。下機後，極赴辦公地點，即日開始工作。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶十八日電〕據此間某報載稱：軍事調處執行總部對綏遠東部集寗之共產軍提出警告稱：彼等如仍不遵守命令，該總部將採「有效措置」。該報謂共軍於本月十六日晚及次日晨曾對該城西門進攻七次。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平十八日電〕派駐軍事調處執行部之美方觀察者，今晨搭機首途，前往中國各地視察，糾正違背停戰命令之軍隊調動。眾悉今日應予糾正之區域，包括沿長城古北口之一部地區，及共軍堅強據點張家口之四週。軍調處部正派遣一三人小組，搭乘火車前往古北口，糾正長城一帶地方之陣地情形。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕軍事調處執行部所派出發佈停戰令人員，已初次遭遇嚴重限制。此項人員旣不得赴東北，即在熱河，行動範圍亦不免縮小。美軍官杜蒂羅上校，所率人員已往赤峯。第二隊原擬派往承德，現已作罷，據稱係因該處機塲設備惡劣，不宜美運輸機降落云。</p>
<p>東北問題顯甚復雜，軍事停止衝突令雖已由國共兩方頒佈，但營口近又被共軍佔。領此事已成軍事調處執行部討論焦點。東九省既已不在範圍之內，則軍事調處執行部在熱河方面究有多少權力，現已遭遇嚴重試騐。該部已派遣偵察機一隊，飛往古北口偵察，傳該處仍有衝突，軍事調處執行部即將派員前往。其他調處人員則已到達綏省集寗及魯省濟南，此項人員均攜有無綫電裝備，並有運輸機六七架，以備戰乘之返歸北平。</p>
<p>此間軍事調處執行部政府代表已有八十人，美方代表亦近百人，共黨代表則因運輸困難，尚未到齊。共黨代表一批，分乘飛機兩架由張家口及延安抵此，惟目前共黨代表總數仍不滿五十人。</p>

<h3>蔣經國自平飛長　我保安隊開始佈防瀋陽區</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕蔣經國今晚由重慶飛返故都了。他樂觀，他對莫斯科有良好的印象。此外，便甚麽都不肯講。明天沈怡市長就要飛長春，準備上任。回平整整兩個月的高惜冰主席，最近買了兩幅名畫，縣在旅邸裏獨自欣賞，來消遣從鴨綠江邊帶給他的憂鬱和寂寞。前幾天他急着去長春，經人勸阻，已作罷。瀋陽的董文琦市長，一上任就臥病旅邸，國軍到了瀋陽，他的病也霍然而愈，合江、黑龍江、吉林三省主席，還在長春待命中，興安主席吳煥章，在北平也不曾起身接收，似乎還不可是以驚人的速度展開。營口被共軍攻佔了，這對於東北的現局，似不無震動。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕關係方面消息：蘇軍定二十日自長春撤退，該地我保安隊已開始佈防瀋陽一帶。又蔣經國今晚由渝飛抵北平，定十八日飛長春。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院及中國大使館今日宣稱：錦州所傳蘇聯曾向中國政府要求共同管理東北商用飛機塲及重工業，此間尚未能予以證實。</p>
<h3>金融機關先後復業　哈爾濱市況繁榮　松江省各縣急需農具棉花</h3>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱十八日電〕此間自省市行政相繼接收後，市況日趨繁榮，金融尤見靈活躍。哈市金融機關在偽滿時代，共有官營五家，民營十一家。八一五以後，因社會秩序失常，營業多陷停頓。全部市政接收後，除官營之偽中央銀行由中央銀行接收開業外，民營銀行中之益發·功成·國民·及猶太等行，亦先後復業。而蘇聯之遠東銀行，亦於正金銀行之舊址開業。因金融靈活，治安好轉，商工百業，逐漸昭蘇。據益發銀行經理稱：該行自一月七日復業後，僅一週間即收進一千萬以上之存款，最近每日收進存款，平均在百五十萬以上，約等於偽滿時代一年間之存款額。現舊歷年關在邇，四鄉年貨車馬，絡繹於途，一切物品，皆　時上市，商業之盛，無異平時，預料交通恢復後，當更有迅速發展。</p>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱十六日電〕松江省府接收以來，各縣代表紛來此間報告地方情形，目前各縣一致感覺極待解決者，厥為春耕與棉花兩問題。過去十四年間。受日人無情榨取，多已不支，近在兵　之後，尤感窘迫。且鐵質農具為日人沒收，現已無存，故切盼當局於舉辦農具貸款，運來棉花外，並能有農具散發農民，以利耕籽。</p>
<p>〔中央社四平十六日電〕建　昨日派員接收此間一油化工廠，更名為遼北省煉油廠，該廠八自一五迄今，未曾中斷工作。現僅產煤油，每日可出十噸。據調查，該廠原料，尚可維持至本年五月，再四平市府，亦於同日派員接收「東洋」，「康德」兩麵粉廠，籌備復工中。</p>
<h3>停止衝突令限期後　共產軍新奇戰略　「換防」「接防」「吿哀」</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕軍調處之執行工作，堪稱英勇。昨今兩日，均見攜有大批停止衝突命令之海軍飛機，冒極大危險，低飛於犯袞州宅安等地共軍陣地之上空，至反應如何，今日尚不能預言。惟據今晚來自津浦北段搶修鐵路之工程人員談：停戰協定消息公布後，共軍之新奇戰略，幾使魯省軍民，迷惑困擾，而啼笑皆非。其實際情形如下：（一）「換防」，共軍偷襲國軍得手後，通知國軍，聲明此來係奉令接防，請勿誤會。旣然停戰，從此停戰。昨日之事，不必計較。其布告民眾之理由，亦曰「接防」。「接防」，共軍偷襲國軍接得甲據點後，國軍為必遵停戰命令撤退，讓至乙據點，共軍乃得寸進尺，再施攻擊。此際國軍如慢條斯理，講情講理，派員向共軍質問，共軍亦以極禮貌之口氣修函答復，說明實來乃奉令接防，如不退讓，　由你開，罪不在我。（三）「告哀」，共軍偷襲國軍不逞，其時後援又不濟，頹喪之餘，外慚淸議，內咎神明，乃厚臉向國軍吿哀。聲稱：此來不在攻城略地，之因糧盡衣單，不得已而為之，請酌借被服糧食及法幣若干，此新奇戰略之最下者。</p>
<h3>我存印物資　將陸續運滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社加爾各答十七日專電〕我國存印物資接收委員會，已在此間展開工作。第一批物資約六千餘噸，本月中旬可在此間碼頭裝載完畢，由英貨輪兩艘運滬。以後每月可望載運兩次以上。以目前運輸情形觀察，約在四個月或半年內，可以全部由印載運至滬。</p>
<h3>粵對外貿易　逐月在增加　關稅月逾三千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕此間恢復國際商運以來，洋貨源源運入，土貨亦恢復正常，對外貿易，故關稅收入，日有增加。粵海關稅務司霍啓謙語記者稱：去年九月份收入，約四百餘萬元，十月份增至五百六十餘萬元，十一月份又增至一千三百萬元，至十二月份則已超過三千萬元。由此可見廣州光復後，對外貿易之活躍成績。</p>

<p>〔又十五日電〕原定今日續談解決曼谷槍殺華僑事件之中暹談判，因暹內長班雅克特身體不適，展至明日下午，與增進兩國外交關係之談判分別舉行。我代表三人，改與暹警察總監佛拉藍印特拉談判槍殺事件達半小時。佛氏對該不幸事件，表示遺憾，希望有長久友誼之中暹兩國人民，將來在暹羅能共同安居樂業。據悉：我代表團將提出下列各項條件，作解決該暴行事件之基礎：（一）查明肇事之責任，懲辦犯罪者。（二）賠償我僑胞全部損失。及（三）保證將來不發生同樣事件。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕東北九省與內地之匯兌，即將開始舉辦，此間經濟委員會，將專設一由七人組成之委員會，負責管理此事。該會設於長春，必要時將在瀋陽，哈爾濱，大連等大城，設立分會。凡由東北九省，以流通券結匯法幣，或自內地以法幣結匯流通券，均須先向該會申請核准，但每戶每月匯款，在流通券五千元，或同值法幣以下者，毋庸申請。此項匯兌，將由中央銀行及其委託之銀行經營之，其他銀行一概不准經營。其匯價每日由中央銀行掛牌公佈。又此間各銀行，自以十三比一之兌換率收兌法幣以來，前往兌換者，甚為寥寥。此或可說明流來此間之法幣根本不多。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十八日電〕東北郵電交通，正積極籌備恢復中。各地郵電機能，雖停頓已久，然大部員工，仍固守崗位，靜待中央接收。目前交通部電訊主管人員，正研究價目問題，一俟安妥，即可開業。又關於中長鐵路以外之鐵路交通接收事宜，目前仍在準備階段，全部接收恐須在一個月後。</p>
<h3>潮汕豫災情嚴重　救濟總署發表調查報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕聯合國救濟總署，於去年十月間，派視察詹遜，及莫葉，龐納爾，分赴潮汕及河南一帶，視察遭敵騎蹂躪後之受災情形，及調查各該地急需之救濟物資，詹氏等已於上月間將上列各地災況，詳細調查完畢，並已繕具報告　提交總署，詳述損害災情及救濟善后辦法。　茲將其原文節錄如次：</p>
<p>赴潮汕一帶視察者，為詹遜氏。詹氏於去年十月十八日由廣東出發前往，調查歷時兩週餘，其報告書長達二十五頁，據其報告謂：「潮汕（潮州區連汕頭在內）之人口總額，在一九三九年為四·七五〇·〇〇〇，自一九三九年以　，戶口大減，惟目前欲調查全區戶口總額，實屬非易，查人口減少原因，厥為下述數端，即　入內地，死於空襲，日方暴行，颶風，營養缺乏，及疾病，為日軍當道掠去是。調查時曾在數處舉行，人口變更及其原因之試騐統計，結果汕頭在渝淪陷前（一九三九年）有二二〇·〇〇〇人，調查時（一九四五年十一月）為一五〇·〇〇〇人，汕頭現有人數，較睹淪陷前，少去六〇·〇〇〇人。其中死於災馑及疾病者二五·〇〇〇人，為日軍殺害或掠去者五·〇〇〇人，死於空襲者一·〇〇〇人，尚餘二九·〇〇〇人，無從調查，殆已在流亡之際，死於飢饉矣」。</p>
<p>該報告又稱：「潮汕區現處於窘困之狀態中，致此原因，為（一）荒災與日軍搶刧。（二）海軍阻斷，外米不來，貿易停頓。（三）兩大生產（即　織業與漁業）之完全停頓，（四）農業衰落，　產喪失，肥料缺乏。（五）財政紊亂，海外匯款停止。（六）政治現狀。關於救濟方面，該區食米需要甚亟，列為應予救濟之第一項。衣着次之，醫藥與治療又次之。再次為住屋，最後為流落人民。」</p>
<p>對於善後問題，詹氏亦詳加列述稱：「查潮汕區從事　織者共四十萬人，原料來自外洋，成品輸往美國等處。迨戰事發生，對外交通中斷，此業遂一落千丈，資本盡喪。業中人現請求助以復業之資金，恢復外洋航綫，調整外匯。此外尚有其他手工業如竹工漿陶器業等。又查潮汕區最重要之出產，厥為漁業，因漁舟損失泰半，故其處境極為艱難，但其所需之援助，或屬最易給予者。蓋其所需者為造船之木料，製造鋼索等之桐油與蔴，以及鐵與釘及器具而已。又該區產米不多，僅足供民食之半數，戰時農民逃散，外來原料，不復運入，以致產量更少。今農民所亟需者，首為人造原料與荳餅，而荳餅尤為歡迎。次為耕牛與農具之補充，且築堤防水亦為急務。凡此請求，均已譯送總署廣州地區辦事處核辦矣。建築物與公用事業之被毀者，須俟獲有借款並有水泥等輸入後，方可着手重建，詳細需要刻在編製中。關於交通方面，外洋航業與內河交通之重要，無待贅述，所毀失各種船隻之淸冊，亦正在編製中。汕頭至潮安原有鐵路，但鐵軌今已不存在，而路基且變為汽車路矣。」</p>
<p>莫葉與鹿納爾兩氏，代表聯總前往豫省，騎馬做轎，並搭行駛徐緩之汽車，行四萬餘哩　以調查該省之戰災情形。據其估計，豫省約有二百萬人，佔全省人民六分之一，現處於將成餓莩之窘境，亟待救濟。且在寒冬多穿夏衣，此輩不幸之人更無蔽寒之所。因食衣住三項之缺乏，傳染疾病乃猖獗於豫省各處矣。豫西迭經戰爭，為敵盤踞，故其情狀最為惡劣，有二十餘萬貧民避難他鄉，近已圓里，則見其　舍非被焚毀，即遭搶刦，而所有家具，亦為日人摧毀無遺。據兩代表稱：「吾人每至一處，輒聞人言，自日本失敗後，彼等還鄉之日，至吾人十一月前來視察之時，在此兩個時期中，豫西人病者佔百分之八九十。」在受禍更甚之處，死者佔人口總額百分之十與百分之十五間。聯合國善救總署代表又稱：「最重要之需要，為農業善後。今牲畜之缺少，乃最嚴重之單獨問題」。前於一九四五年日軍蹂躪豫省，圖犯西安時，曾棄家他避者，無不異口同聲相告曰：「上屆之麥無收穫，而下屆之麥又未種植」。此種訴苦之聲，豫西無處無之。蓋去歲日軍　入時，豫人未及種麥，倉促他適，以致歸鄉時無所收穫矣。聯合國善救總署代表又陳述，第一　鄉當局發起一種無需外助之自助辦法。其他數縣亦採用之而有成效。其言曰：此項法辦　種用鄰地未受戰害仍有牲畜者之耕牛，以耕種收復區之田地，此純以有者援助無者之單純哲學為根據，一縣內分佈三千餘牛，平均計之，約工作二十天，牛主偕其牛同來工作並供芻料，至於人的食物，則由當地救濟委員會供給之，惟此種制度不能適用於六月間農忙之時，以其時須割麥打麥，而在一個月內尚須種植也。</p>
<p>農人需求鋼鐵，以製耕具，相信有若干區，獲有借款，即可便利曳引機與其他器械之備置。惟在完全破壞之區，則需直接之救濟。所需之其他器械，包括新織機在內，此為工作救濟之計劃，俾代替為日軍所毀之十萬餘架手織機。豫省除戰禍外，尚有黃河災區，起於一九三二年　堤以阻日軍前進之時，此乃豫省一個範圍廣大的救濟善後問題。估計水漲時被淹之區，原有居民五百萬人，惟黃河災區，目前難民究有幾何，則未有正確統計。約略計之，黃河災區現約有二百萬人，其中至少有一百萬人在嗷嗷待哺中。今所擬此區善後計劃，有黃河歸入原道，及沿河築堤，以縮小被淹區域，且免良田續遭汜濫一項。豫省受災最重之地多有天主教堂，據教士言，人民飢不擇食，荒災極重，故食物乃所需之最重要救濟品，但衣着醫藥之救濟，亦屬重要。</p>

<h3>英外相宣布放棄　非洲委任統治地　置於託管制度之下</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕英外相貝文昨在聯合國機構大會中宜佈，英國之非洲委任統治地三處，即丹根伊加，上上摩隆與吐戈闌，將置於託管制度之下，外約丹則將成獨立邦，任何國家迄今在倫敦大會中所取步驟，要以此為最重要而最具遠大影響，繼之駐南非專員於昨晚說明西南非洲即現由南非聯邦委任統治之舊德國殖民地，須至徵詢該地人民後，始決定其前途，關於英國在非委任統治地三處交予託管理事會事，業已開始初步磋商。聞外約丹之元全獨立事，將於酋長阿勃杜拉下月來游倫敦時商權之。至此，尚在英國直接委任統治下之土地，僅巴勒斯坦一處而已。據貝文宣佈，今須待英美調查巴勒斯坦委員會查得結果，然後方能就該聖地提出建議。貝文之言，已引起各方注意。緣一般人咸以為外約丹與巴勒斯坦或將聯合而以劃分辦法解決巴勒斯坦問題，昨夜各方意見，似認外約丹之獨立，不致使巴勒斯坦問題之劃分解決辦法，更增困難，據本社特派員金樞稱：予外約丹以獨立，有若干要點須加考慮，例如外約丹在中東乃處於特別地位，為保降本身安全，其軍隊殊關重要，故外約丹之獨立，對其軍隊之前途，實有密切連繫，因此阿勃杜拉來倫敦時，或將提出與伊拉克組聯防軍等問題。按：丹根伊加舊屬德領東非洲，後曾由英比兩國劃分，至一九二一年交英國委任統治，土人逾五百萬，歐人一萬六千人，由總督管理，下設執行與立法兩議會。卡摩隆在尼奇里亞與法屬赤道非洲之間，一九一六年自德方奪獲，三年後由英法劃分，至一九二二年交英國委任統治，人口不足百萬，歸尼奇里亞總督兼管。吐戈闌在黃金海岸殖民地與法屬達霍梅之間，一九一四年八月德人無條件交出，第一次世界大戰由英法劃分，英方委任統治之區，人口不足五十萬歸黃金海岸總督兼管。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦　不在放棄之列</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕英外相貝文今日在聯合國大會宣布，英國已決定將菲洲委任統治地三處移歸聯合國代營，外約丹則最後將予以獨立。全場一致報以采聾。但各國代表大多事先已有所聞，故並不引以為異。惟英國所疑放棄之委任統治地，巴勒斯坦不在其列，似因英美調查委員會方在巴勒斯坦考察阿拉伯與猶太人情勢，此時如有所宣布，將妨礙該委員會工作。巴勒斯坦在聯合國大會中未派代表出席，故阿拉伯聯盟所屬各國代表對此，極表關切，在道義上咸以全力加以支持。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人之要求，即巴勒斯坦須成為一獨立阿拉伯國家，但各代表對於委員會調查報告，亦以爲未可先懷成見，故非俟報告書發表，不致遽爾決定最後態度。據此間阿拉伯人士稱：美國方面屢有同情猶太人之表示，固堪遺憾，但委員會之結論，可能使阿拉伯人完全滿意，無諭如何，在本屆會期中，巴勒斯坦問題不致引起尖銳衝突，茍委負會報告與阿拉伯意見相反，則阿拉伯聯盟將召開全體大會，以決定阿拉伯政策及戰略云，。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕埃及外長巴連維今日向聯合社記者宣稱：據阿拉伯民族各國意見，英國前所發表之白皮書，已承認巴勒斯坦為一阿拉伯國家，故英美調查巴勒斯坦委負會，無成立必要，</p>
<p>新幾內亞　澳亦宣布放棄</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕據墨爾缽電台廣播，澳洲總理奇弗萊已宣佈，澳洲將以新幾內亞委任統治地移交聯合國機構代管。</p>
<p>〔路透社坎培拉十八日電〕澳總理契夫萊今日宣稱：澳洲已準備將新幾亞與奈厄魯島受澳洲委任統治之部份，交予國際託管，蓋聯合國憲章加諸管理非自治地域，各會員國之義務，澳洲未敢或忘也，至於共同委任統治奈厄魯之英國與紐西蘭政府，已同意於澳洲此項決定云，按奈厄魯島及新幾內亞東部舊係德國殖民地，第一次世界大戰後，交澳洲委任統治，新幾內亞之西部乃荷蘭之殖民地。</p>
<h3>伊朗向大會洽詢控蘇聯手續</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕聯合國機構現仍以伊朗問題爲最大暗礁。如提出安全理事會討論，則蘇美英團結將受影響，如留中不發，則旣不足以平伊朗之憤，且足以打撃全理事會成信。如提而出表決結果與伊朗不利，則各小國對於聯合國機構必失去信仰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕聯合國大會伊朗首席代表　台，今日與大會秘書商議伊朋向安全理事會控訴蘇聯手續問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦十八日廣播：伊朗政府圖將亞塞爾拜，然省伊蘇紛爭，陳訴於聯合國機構大會之決意，已引起重大議程問題。是項問題，由於美英蘇軍隊共同佔領伊朗而起，三國委員會考察伊北局勢之建議，被蘇聯拒絕後，英政府曾「力勸」朗，勿將該案提付聯合國大會裁處，嗣後英政府改變政策，咨照伊朗政府，「對於提付聯合國大會裁處一節，悉隨尊便「云。伊朗代表團，尚未決定該案將提付大會抑安全理事會但似「正傾向於」大會方面，苟提付大會，則或將交付政治安全委員會。該案如交與安全理事會，則極有延期辯論之迹象。因蘇方可同時提出其他麻煩問題，例如希臘印度尼西亞等地英軍之撤退問題等。</p>
<h3>美國會之意見</h3>
<p>代管太平洋各島嶼　由國會作最後決定</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門總統日前宣稱：美國由日本取得之太平洋各島嶼，將移歸聯合國代管，但其有戰略價値者。仍將由美國單獨保管。國會方面今日對此表示意見，以爲究竟何島應歸美國保管，當由國會作最後決定。據民主黨參議員喬治及共和黨參議員　開森稱：希望在國會未討論此問題前，美國勿遽予以確定，此事例須先經議會核准，然後再作決定。若干島嶼，爲戰略理由須加保留者，應遵照陸海軍之建議辦理。爲未來安全計，此等島嶼必須完全由美國保留。有提議將所有太平洋島嶼置於託管制下，而以美國爲唯一受託者，則不能贊同云。</p>
<h3>美英蘇訂協定　處理德國船艦</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十八日電〕據此間今日可靠消息美英蘇三强海軍委員會，對於處理德國軍艦商船及其他艦船配備問題，已成立協定，協定內容即可在華盛頓，莫斯科及倫敦同時發表，據悉除少數艦船將由美國作試騐之用外，其餘軍艦因構造及艦砲口徑不同，各國並不需要。</p>
<h3>好萊們製片家爭攝原子彈影片米高梅已在開拍中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社好萊塢十七日電〕好萊塢若干越片家，碰到了一個問題。那就是怎麼把性的問題和原子彈聯　起來。現在有四臘影片公司，正在互相　爭，看誰能最先觀成一部取材原子彈的影片，到各處去放映。依照好萊場慣例，他們都想在寫實之外，再加上一些　曼斯的成分，山姆馬克斯正在替米高梅公司攝製這標一部影片，自以爲已經把問題解決了，他的片子名曰「亦始亦終」，內容是一個富有人性的故事，裹面描寫原子彈工人的日常生活，是怎樣的緊張，他不准和別人談到他的工作，七個人聚在一起，便有千藥律，不但藥止飲酒。甚至對於一織玩紙牌的人，即須加以　　。馬克斯說：「在原子彈工廠工作的人，對於他們的　子是怎樣一回　張的事，　少人能够　會·她們從來不知道爲什麽　時時搬家，也不知道她們的丈夫，做些什麽工作，或下一次又要搬到那里·許多婚姻因此　於破裂，現在我們看的很淸楚，男的失掉了女的，世界上得到了原子彈，於是男的又得到女的」·馬克斯　從華盛頓和田納西州象脊城遊歷回來，已自杜魯門　統處獲知原子彈的意義，並其他有關原子彈計　的事項。馬克斯設：「原子彈的發明，或許不在一九四五年，而非俟二〇四五年不可，希望美國人看了這部影片，就能够對於原子彈的重要性，得到一些印象」。</p>
<h3>聯合國機構安全理事會　舉行首次會　顧維鈞強調該會重要性</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕聯合國機構之十一同代表今日下午首次會議，具有重大權力之安全理事會至此乃告眞正存在。此項歷史性會議係在倫敦著名之威斯脫敏斯寺及國會大厦中舉行。在此困難時日，維持世界和平之大任，將置於各代表之肩上。安全理事會之永久會員美英蘇法中五國，均有權吾決理事會之任何行動。此外尚包括非永久會員澳洲·巴西·埃及·荷蘭·墨西哥及波蘭。安全理事會之當前要務，爲：（一）聯合國機構秘書長之選舉；（二）軍事參謀委員會會議之首次召開；（三）討論各會員國利用安全理事會軍事力量之辦法。澳洲外長梅金致開會辭稱：「余宣佈安全理事會正式成立開會。」波蘭代表乃向理事會呈上該理事會之籌備委員會報告。美國首席代表史坦汀紐斯稱：安全理事會之成功，端賴各會員國之如何實踐其特殊責任，尤以協調之責任爲最重要，然後理事會始能作有效之行動，此顯指五強之吾決權而言，中國首席代表顧維鈞稱：此一會議乃對世界上愛好和平人民一種具有重大意義之事件。中國酷愛和平，惟不向他人屈服。聯合國機構之主要責任，即在於維持和平與安全，中國對聯合國此主要機關之成立，不勝欣慰。貝文於讀揚聯合國機構及安全理事會爲「一大成功」後，力言國際秘書廳之重要。渠認爲費於聯合國機構而使其生效之金錢，若與戰爭之浩大支出相比較，實屬徽不足道。渠繼稱：目前各國之大集合，乃戰爭最黑暗時代所抱希望之實現，其目的乃在創設一世界機構，俾使人類不懷恐懼而能在自由與和平中生存。聯合國機構之責任，乃將戰爭視爲非法的，一有徵象立即開始行動，安全理事會職責所在，應愼重策劃防止任何侵略者再掀起戰爭。吾人對管制科學發明之原子委員會，亦表歡迎。據此間荷蘭代表團消息，截至目前止，未獲承認之印度尼西亞共和國主席史傑里爾，尚未代表該共和國政府向聯合國機構提出呼籲。荷蘭代表團某國員告合衆社謂：印度尼西亞方面雖傳出此等消息，然至今尚未接得此類請求。捷克斯洛伐克外長馬薩里克繼貝文演說提出建議稱：全世界之軍火工業應由聯合國機構統制，并促設立聯合國機構之分區中心，俾處理衛生與農業等問題。馬氏復建議職工會能派代表參加聯合國機構，尤以經濟社會理事會爲最，俾世界有組織之勞工能在聯合國機構中有發言之權利。目下世界職工聯合會在蘇聯支持之下，正要求此項發言權。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾邀遊美國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社米亞米十七日電〕英國前首相邱吉爾，以七十一歲高齡，作長途旅行，由英國渡大西洋至紐的，再由紐的至弗羅立達州南部，計程四千五百哩，今日據心臟學專家哈利斯博士診察後宣布，邱氏身體健康，未受長途跋涉影響。一般人期望邱氏參加希亞萊賽馬塲開幕禮，但據悉邱氏不擬立即出現於公衆場所，因之此種希望業已消失，昨日晚餐前，邱氏曾與其東道主克拉克上校驟車環游棕櫚夾道之運河地帶及米亞米海濱，約歷一小時許。狀殊悠閒，興緻甚高。</p>
<h3>智利文學家　獲諾貝爾獎金</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十七日電〕智利文學家米斯特萊爾，榮獲諾貝爾文學獎金，法外部文化事業司長勞某爾，今日設宴加以歡迎·</p>
<h3>聯合國大會蘇聯代表　葛洛米科演辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕聯合國機構蘇聯代表團代理團長葛洛米科，今晨在大會會議中致詞，略稱：聯合國機構大會首屆會議，在愛好自由各國爲和平與安全而奮鬥之過程中，乃一重要階段。且爲一九四三年十月四强外長在英斯科會議宣言中所表示意念之必然發展。宣言中所說明老，即必須設一國際機構以保障和平與安全是也。</p>
<p>葛洛米科續稱：無論大小各國，莫不關懷於獲得穩固之和平，及防杜侵略之復演。茲者，負責維護和平之組織，已告成立，侵略者苟有危害和平自由之企圖，安全理事會即可加以遏阻。憲章之最重要定則，因此已獲實施。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團希望安全理事會之活動，以實現聯合國機構之要旨爲目的，自始即獲效果，更望大會將設原子能委員會，如上次莫斯科外長會議所提議者，然今機構甫告產生，即聞若干方面申言憲章已陳舊，須予修正。凡欲建立强力機構以保安全者，對於此種論調均須痛加駁斥，以其具有危險性，且可引起嚴重後果也。</p>
<p>聯合國各組織之活動，欲求獲得成果，則遵守憲軍實爲必要條件，且聯合國機構務須不同於國際聯盟，如果復施國聯所用之方法，必於聯合國機構有害，憲章中若干條規，尚未付諸實施，尤以有關非自治地域一項爲然。</p>
<p>託管制度乃一種工具，意在加速予此等人民以獨立地位，因此儘速實施託管制，乃會員國最重要義務之一，籌備委員會頗有進展，業已通過特殊決議案，請聯合國之某數會員會迅將該類地域之一種，改爲託管地。</p>
<p>葛洛米科又稱：對法西斯主義血戰之結果，產生聯合國機構，今德國法西斯主義及日本黷武主義均已敗北，多年來使世界驚惶不寗。並使人類投入最慘酷戰爭中之兩處侵略來源，乃已消除；但若認此次軍事勝利，已不必復事努力完全肅淸法西斯殘餘勢力，則屬謬誤。肅淸法西斯殘餘之爭鬥，與機構之工作，實不可分離。</p>
<p>葛洛米科末稱：「請許本人表示希望會議工作成功，蘇聯代表團次儘其所能，促使會議大功告成云。</p>
<h3>麥帥再緝日戰犯　共計一百十名磯谷廉介亦在內　統帥部準日是人自擇政黨及領袖</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十八日電〕麥帥絕部今日又令日本政府通緝戰爭　疑犯一百十名，內有將官七名及亞洲各地）　　管理員多名。前任大本　　　長和志，名列第一。其次爲前任香港總督磯谷康介中將，前菲律濱已達諾島日軍司令川谷中將，前第二十五軍長坂井中將，前第六師長谷中將，前第三十八師長掛左中將，前新嘉坡第三戰時運輸隊司令渡邊少將，俘虜船「立花」丸船長安田等新嫌疑犯中七十名以上，均爲俘虜營負責人，包括菲律濱著名之加巴那兜安俘虜及瀋陽俘虜營監督官數人在內。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處東京十七日電〕「紐的時報」駐東京記者克蘭息報導稱：日本之共產黨在次漂亮的向後轉」之后，提議剝奪天皇之政治權力，但仍保留其作爲一「形式上之領袖」。以待日本全國總投票決定其以後之命運。此一聰明之政治行動，繼日共領袖岡野進之回國而發生·岡野進在十六年流亡生活中，曾數易其名，最近曾在中共要據地延安居留，近兩年來其一貫主張爲廢除天皇。惟岡野進今已明瞭眞象。乘回國之后即力勸日本共產黨改位易轍，蓋遵循原來之路錢，實無異政治上自殺。無論日人能如何接受自由主義之思想，渠等始終認天皇爲國家之元首，故日共廢除天皇之要求，並未受到熱烈之歡迎。惟日共改變方針之後，局勢顯已不同。日共曾與日本社會黨敷度商討成立「人民陣綫」，今乃稍鬆希望，至少有日本社會民主黨左翼領袖二十九人已同意加入此一「人民陣錢」。日本共產黨經此轉變而勢力大增，日本右翼政黨十四黨爲對抗起見，亦宣佈將成立聯合陣綫，惟其力量顯然不能與即可成立之「人民陣綫」相頡頑。</p>
<p>日本警察准携手槍</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十八日電〕據今日宣佈：麥克阿瑟統帥已允許日本政府，以手槍配備日本警察，麥帥訓令稱：日方禁止警察携帶武器，係誤解麥帥所發之解除武裝訓令。以前所發之訓令，對於警察携帶手槍一點，從未加以禁止，「麥帥總部始終無此意向，」日方曾表示，謂警察不備武器，足以妨碍秩序之維持及犯罪之撲滅，惟警察於執行職務時，雖得携帶手槍，但所發手槍之總數，不得超過麥帥總部所核准之警察隊人數又每一手槍得裝子彈一百發，其餘軍火及逾額之手槍，均須響核准之日警實力之意。按麥帥所核准之日本警察，總計九三、九三五名。</p>
<h3>澳紐提戰犯名單　裕仁亦在內</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十七日專電〕澳洲及紐西蘭政府，已提出包括日皇裕仁在內之戰犯名單，此使盟軍總部頗感爲難，蓋總部之意，乃不使日皇列入戰犯名單也，英國所提之名單，並未將日皇列爲戰犯。</p>
<h3>日將組織保皇黨</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十八日電〕據時事通訊社稱，日本即將組織保皇黨，敎導國民天皇制度。將由工商界次要人物支持。該黨並將提議皇宮遷住京都古城，傳國王對政治處於超然地位。</p>

<h3>艾帥告參院稱　減少太平洋美軍　將削弱控制力量</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕陸軍參謀長艾森豪威爾今日向參院軍事委員會轉達麥帥報告稱：太平洋方面美國駐軍，如在七月一日减少至四十萬人以下，則對於日本及韓國之軍事控制力，必將「削弱至危險程度」。太平洋方面駐軍將於七月一日减少至三十七萬五工人，較麥帥所需要者不足二萬五五人，應如何補救。艾帥即答稱：予所調整者爲空軍總數，麥帥所言者則包括日本·韓國。菲律賓。馬里安那及夏威夷各地全部駐軍云·</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日午夜廣播：今晨九時聯合國全體大會召開非常會議，蘇聯首席代表人民外交委員會副委員長維雪尼夫斯基於本日下午飛抵此間出席參加會議，與維雪尼夫斯基同時抵達者，尚有法方代表一人。蘇聯代表格洛米科今日在大會中曾代表維辛斯基發表演說語頗扼要中肯</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕葛洛米科今晨係代蘇聯代表團長維辛斯慕致詞，預料維辛斯基今日尚不能到達倫敦。同時，法國外長畢都爾及次長特摩維爾，定今日從巴黎返此，而對歐洲敵國草擬和約有關四國之外交次長，頗有立刻開始工作之可能，在維辛斯基抵倫敦以前，彼等能吾較草擬開始工作之計劃，更進一步，固未可決，抑法政府現旣接受近在莫斯科商妥之協議，則四强次長進行工作，已不復有阻碍矣。</p>

<p>協商會議全景</p>
<h3>和平建國史上第一里程碑　協商會在圖片中</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>「紐約時報」於七日社評中說得極眞摯，其主要之點，指出我國上下均巳明確認識了統一與和平乃是中華民族復興之基礎，並且願意把這一個基礎建築在十日開始舉行的政治協商會議。而在召開協商會的前夜，我們便很强烈地懷着一種壓倒似的願望—寄托在馬張周三位將軍所組成的三人委員會會議身上的願望。這會議已於七日晨十時在怡園，開始舉行。會談後，政府與共黨兩代表（張羣與周恩來），與馬歇爾上將合攝了一張具有特殊價値的照片。（見第三圖）馬歇爾上將，在這裏是擔任了該委員會的主席，並完成了調解人的偉大艱鉅的任務。</p>
<p>三人委員會的成就是偉大的，一方面奠定了停止軍事衝突之初基，另方面解決了恢復全國交通的先決問題。</p>
<p>同時，就在馬歇爾·張羣·周恩來三人委員會在那裏會談的一天，協商會非正式會議，在　蔣主席主持之下也召開了，道一個會，包括着九個黨派和若干無黨無派的代表，共三十八人。討論了準備在十日展幕的第一次協商會大會的議程及投票方式等問題，在極其圓滿和諧之空氣中進行以至於結束。共黨代表七人，即：周恩來·董必武·陸定一·葉劍英·鄧頴超·吳玉章·王若飛。他們合攝的一張照片，刋在這裏，（見第四圖）最令人感到特殊興味的，是周恩來和鄧頴超是一對賢伉儷，佔了全部代表分七之二，實爲難得。</p>
<p>在八日那天，民主建國會招待了協商會代表，由彭一湖致詞，其熱烈的情緒可在第五圖中看得出來。</p>
<p>具有歷史意義的協商會終於在十日誕生了。這一個寗馨兒是在數月來的苦難與爭執之下誕生出來的，所以當着它的誕辰，全體軍民都覺得歡天喜地，從第二圖裏面，我們看到了在國民政府大禮堂中開幕時的隆重與融治，第一圖給我們暗示出了各黨各派無黨無派的代表們準時蒞會的整肅與熱烈。最後，第五張圖角上所表現的，是靑年黨代表曾琦致詞的姿態。</p>
<h3>林次長　向協商會報告　整軍設施</h3>
<p>軍政部次長林蔚於十六日出席政治協商會議時所作關於整軍設施之報告，全文共分兩個階段：前一階段述及去年度整軍情況，已見本報十七日第一版，據中央社來函稱：『昨日敝社所發林蔚次長報告整軍設施文內，數字稍有錯誤，茲更正如下：「第一，整軍之原因……部隊總數量有四九軍一二八師」，「一二八師」應改爲「一八二師」，……擴張至一二四軍三五四師三一旅一一二團一五營」，遺漏「一一二團」。……此種擴張率，大約不過兩倍，「兩倍」應改爲「一倍」。』後一階段，係闡明本年度整軍計劃，茲從第（四）節起，移刊於此，希讀者注意。（編者）</p>
<p>凡每一部隊，遵照整編原則實施整編完畢後，即可開始發給新給與如未遵照原則整編之部隊，則仍發舊給，與如某部隊先整編完畢，即先享受新給與待遇。截至三十四年年底止，部隊改編情形如下：（一）三十三年底原有，一二四軍三五四師三一旅一一二國十五營。（二）裁减三十六年一一一師二十一旅八十三團十營。</p>
<p>（三）已編妥者八七軍二三五師八旅三五團五營。（四）未經整編者尚有四軍一八師，大部在新疆未易實行之地區。（五）現有八十九個步兵軍，二個騎兵軍，二五三個師。（內有新增靑年軍三軍八師及新改編二師）關於充實方面，當計劃之初，完全根據反攻計劃，充實反攻主力部隊之戰力，衡量國內兵工生產與國外物資援助情形，故首先充實陸軍總部所轄部隊（即阿爾發部隊）及西南區部隊，其充實情形如下：（一）預定美械裝備一二軍三六師，國械裝備一〇軍三一師團，至三十四年底止，美械完成輕兵器百分之八十，重兵器百分之五十五。國械完成一〇軍三一師之裝備，其他編整後部隊，亦預有計劃，逐漸充實。（二）改善官兵之生活，去年抗戰期間，物價高漲特甚，生產運輸兩俱艱絕，全國官兵生活已陷於極苦狀態，太部竭中央財政所及，針對生活之因難，分兩大端之改善，即提高待遇與補給食物是也。關於官兵待遇之提高，自卅四年四月至十一月，業經三次之調整，計官長薪餉增至六至七倍，士兵約增至卅餘倍，祗以國家財力物力所限，與物價增漲過甚，尚未能做到理想地步。其次補給食物，卽定量發給現品，為增加兵官營養極迫切之需要，本部下最大決心，欲求達到此目的，對副食費雖定有標準，而對各地物價過高者，亦酌予增加，實施以來，士兵營養改善已多，惟各地情形及運輸關係，尚未能全部澈底實行，良爲遺憾。（三）調整軍事機構軍事機構與軍事學校大小單位計四三〇〇個，經裁去一五〇四個，現有約二七九六個，約裁去百分之四十，原有軍事學校九二個，裁去四九個，現共有四三個，約裁去二分之一以上。整編結果，共裁减一百十萬人員（四）安置編餘官兵部隊，裁編之後，對編於人員之安置，誠爲當務之急，曾定有詳細辦法，以期編餘人員各得其所對於編餘官佐第一步設立軍官總隊，以資分區收　，先後計設立軍官總隊十四個，大隊四個，中隊四個，共計收到三萬七千餘人，幷規定凡新成立之機構或其他，補用之人員，均應由各軍官隊儘先調用，第二次則按其性能志願再予以專業訓練，本年轉業現規定由中央訓練團爲轉業訓練之總機構，委託有關各部設置各種專門之技術訓練班，實地訓練。</p>
<h3>本年度整軍計劃</h3>
<p>抗戰旣經結束，本年已是復員階段，國軍兵力之保持，自應依據國防原則，衡量國家經濟力量，儘最大可能，縮减成最小限度之精銳部隊故策定綱要，確定目標，期於半年以內，縮小爲九十個師，卽等於抗戰初期（廿六年）兵力之二分之一，抗戰末期兵力（卅三年底）四分之一，分述其要項如次：（一）國軍現有步兵八十九軍，二百四十師，（十八集團三個師在內），騎兵二軍十三師，共約三百八十餘萬人，擬整編爲九十個師及騎兵十個旅，連同特種兵及勤務部隊，共保留官兵約一百八十萬人。</p>
<h3>整編國軍全部縮成九十個師</h3>
<p>（二）整編期限分爲兩期，每期三個月，第一期整編四十四個軍，二期整編四十五個軍，預期於半年內整編完畢，騎兵不分期整編，預定六月以前，全部完成。（三）各軍均先自行縮編三分之一，即原三師九團之軍，編爲三師六團之軍，原二師六團之軍，編爲兩師四團之軍，然後再按編制整編爲九十個師，整編後，應成立之軍部，由各集團軍司令部編成之。（四）各獨立師旅團均加入軍內合併整編。（五）各軍師整編後多餘之特種部隊，得准保留酌編爲獨立團，歸軍委會直轄，（六）僞軍及挺進游擊等部隊，去年八月曾編遣完畢者須於四個月以內，一律編遺完畢。（七）各軍師照規定編制，編整完畢後，得將官兵待遇提高，希望達到文武待遇一致之目的</p>
<h3>編餘官兵安置　擬定具體辦法</h3>
<p>編餘官兵之安置，繼續上年度計劃擬定具體辦法如次：（一）集團轉業預定約一百萬人，（內官佐的十萬人）分配於交通·水利·墾殖·工廠·地方服務隊，其他各種交通警衛。（二）各別轉業廿萬人，（以軍官佐屬為限）預定訓練後，分配於行政·交通·敎育·警察及其他各種國家事業。（三）資遣退伍預定五十萬人，凡年老力弱，自願還鄉者，均照規定退伍資遣之。</p>
<h3>關於遊擊部隊　及偽軍之處理</h3>
<p>游擊部隊與挺進部隊地方團隊等之編併，編併原則：（一）屬於地方團隊者，應仍歸還地方政府妥行分別安置，（二）游擊挺進等部隊，照國軍緇整游擊部隊辦法，逐次編併於軍師內而撤銷之。（三）所有編餘有正式出身之官佐，一律收訓，統籌安置，在收訓期間，準照新給與八成薪待遇，編併經過。（一）原有游擊部隊計縱隊一六〇，支隊三八，大隊共二〇三個單位，官兵七十二萬零二百七十一人，槍枝十四萬四千六百八十校。（二）至卅四年底，除第十二戰區之五個縱隊尚未整編外，其餘巳大部撥補正規部隊，一部改編爲十八個保安團，廿二個補充團，四個監護團共的十萬一千人，僞軍之管理處原則，對僞軍之處理，中央決定方針以編遣爲基本原則，至於官佐等按甘心附逆投機兩可被迫脅從，奉派策反等四種，分別主從處理之。處理情形，各地僞軍，（除東北外）據陸軍總部及各戰區冊報，共有五十一個單位，約六十餘萬人。自國軍進入收復區以來，除長江以南如第三、六、七、九，各戰區及二、三、四各方面軍，秩序大體底定，所有偽軍已依照計劃，一律編遣，計二十餘萬人。至長江以北，如第二、五、十、十一、十二、等戰區，約四十萬人，除編遣外，因情況尚未能如預期迅速編遣者，約有二十萬人。本部規定須於四個月內處理完成。以上所述，爲本部自去年初以來，關爲整軍計劃與實施經過之大略，本部自加檢討，深知缺點甚多，距離建軍目的甚遠，自後惟有一面努力研究改進，一面努力執行，以期達成中央所決定政策，完成初步建軍大業，以仰副　委員長及全國同胞之期望。（續完）</p>
<p>蔣主席在協商會　舉行揭幕典禮致詞</p>
<h3>中國第一位樞機主教　田耕莘出身寒微</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自大美晚報</p>
<p>最近羅馬敎宗，（俗稱敎皇）庇護十二世，選任田耕莘主敎爲羅馬敎廷樞機主敎。中國人之膺選此項敎廷要職，田主敎尚屬第一人，實開中國歷史上的創舉。</p>
<h3>歐陸動亂　田氏升任主教</h3>
<p>田主敎是在一九三九年十月，基督佳節，在羅馬升任主敎之職。那時戰爭的烽火正瀰漫於歐洲大陸，大量的軍隊正在開拔中，是一個大亂動的非常時期。然而在羅馬那裏，田主敎和其他十一位國籍不同的新授職的主敎，却靜靜地匍匐在聖壇的階墀下，恭聆着敎宗庇護十二世傳誦一道祈求世界和平和世界大同的文書。此後，田主敎便拼擋行裝，準備返　祖國，執行他神聖使命。</p>
<h3>馬車一輛　通過危險地帶</h3>
<p>先是，田主敎由中國前往羅馬，曾經備嘗艱苦。他從中國內地出發，乘坐一輛馬車，通過危險的火綫，跋涉二百餘哩，最後乘火車到達上海，完成他第一段的旅程。由此他換登「香霍斯號」　船，取道香港，馬尼刺，向蘇彝士進發。當他置身於波濤汹湧的大洋面時，歐洲的戰火已一發而不可收抬了。那輪船不得不駛往神戶。田主敎由此折回上海，改登『　柴爾號』前往那不勒斯。</p>
<h3>布衣起家　家學淵源精湛</h3>
<p>田主敎是布衣起家的，在樞機主敎中，很少有比他的出身更低微的。他的家族，世世代代，住在山東的一個小村落—章邱—那裏。他的父親受過良好的敎育，精通國學，得有學位，過着教師的生涯，垂二十五年。一八九二年，他在一所天主敎神學院裏，担任中國文學敎授。一八九八年，他受了天主教洗禮，翌年便溘然長逝。一九一五年，主教的母親亦受了洗禮，死於一九二二年</p>
<p>田主敎生於一八九〇年月十二十四日，隨其父母同居於陽穀縣的一個村落裏。十歲時，他被送入博里（譯音）地方的敎會學校，攻讀中國的經書，並研習敎義他於一九〇〇年受洗，一九〇四年八月，入博里初級神學校肄業。一九一八年六月九日，他擔任了敎士職位，在山東單縣開始執行他的神聖的職務。此後兩年，他在神言會中學習修行然後再在那裏恢復執行敎會實際工作。一九三二年他被指派爲博星縣的代理牧師。一九三四年二月二十四日被任爲敎宗特派的敎長。一九三九年七月，他被選任爲陽　縣敎宗特派牧師，同年十月，由敎宗庇護十二世親授主敎議。幸　得很，田主敎的十字架，是由敎宗親自授與的，它包藏着聖十字架的一個貴重的聖物。</p>
<p>有一位和田主敎相交二十多年的敎友，說他是第一個而且永遠是一位「聖靈的牧人」，他自始是一位模範牧師，他的不倦的熱忱和堅定的虔誠使他躋登了現在的榮譽職位。</p>
<p>田主敎不僅忠勒於宣敎事業，他對於敎育亦十分重視。他最近計劃在靑島設立一所中學校。</p>
<h3>攻讀經義　執行神聖工作</h3>
<p>田主敎待人接物，和藹可親，態度莊重，深為洲的敎友和各界人士所推重。除本國文字外，兼諳英德兩國文字，可說是一位品學兼優的難得的人才。但是田主敎素性謙恭，從不自負，此次榮膺中國的第一位樞機主敎，或許田主敎要覺得受寵若驚吧。</p>
<p>天主敎自從明季傳入中國，迄今已有三百多年。中國的天主敎信徒，各地都有，自然，比較起全人口來，這數量還佔着很小的百分比。我們不能否認天主敎的傳布，對於中國是有良好的影響田耕莘主敎膺任樞機主敎，我們相信東方的道德與西方的精神彼此將有更密切的聯繫，更深刻的融和，其所包含的意義，不僅是增加我國際榮譽，而且是和我國族前途有莫大的關係。</p>

<p>二房東狐假虎威</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人等居住於中正中路銅仁路口九七三號共計二十一戶，該屋以前曾由二房東趙文秋開設偉來飯店，後經淸理停業，一切水電等費自理。此次勝利後，趙文秋忽異想天開，欲出頂於人，重開飯店，故先向各房客要求非法加租，以作驅逐之計，欲依旅館收費辦法，每間每日收費一千元，房客等以該屋並無旅館設備何能如此收費，予以拒絕，同時，以該二房東正在請發旅館執照，乃向上海市財政局查詢，蒙該局派員調查後，認房客等之理由爲有理，即將其執照撤銷，並於一月九日以市財照三五字第二九六號公函賜覆。不料該二房東見此計不售，又出惡計，竟於一月十五日深夜十二時，偕同自稱靜安寺捕房之第「三一三三」號及第「二六六五」號警察突然蒞臨，向各房客查房間。查此種舉動，十餘年來從未有過。各房客以事出意外，於睡夢中被其吵醒，大都驚駭莫名。間有開門稍遲者，即遭其賞給耳光。該二警察除各別詢問職業姓名等外，並以實彈手槍出示威脅，命各房客將房門鑰匙交出，配備同樣鑰匙，以供二房東之使用。如此，則各房客私人財產全無保陣，如發生偷盜事件，不知誰負其責？且該警察旣來查房間，而於同寓之英人林恩先生處，並未去查過，中國現下已一躍而爲四强之一，該警察猶如此重洋輕華，妄生分別，尤所不解。爲特具函奉告，請求予以公佈，究竟二房東此種舉動是否合法，該二警察有何依據？吾人如何可以享受居住之自由？還祈指導，不勝幸甚！中正中路九七三號全體房客謹上。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>我們也埀涕而道</h3>
<p>政治協商會議開幕之日，邵從恩氏以七五老翁，作誠懇的呼籲，他說「扶病到會，垂涕而道，」全塲爲之動容。如果出席的會員盡有天良，那末一星期來的會議景况應該更能喜訊頻傳，可是據各方來的報道，會塲上固見脣槍舌劍，熱鬧非凡，戰塲上却依然拆路毀礦，絲毫不懈。而十六日的大會中，邵力子氏又很和氣的請大家說公道話。可見前一位邵翁的垂涕而道，還沒有收到什麼預期的效果，致勞另一位邵先生發急，呼籲公道。我們報人，旣非「政協」會員，也沒有以報人資格組織了什麼會，就算政黨，參加「政協」，則我們在會外來說幾句話，雖不敢自詡公道，至少當可代表了一部分民衆。今天也追隨邵翁，垂涕而道，願「政協」諸公勿忽略了其中實含有民衆無窮的血淚！</p>
<p>老百姓首先要請政協諸公言而有信。諸公究竟代表了那一黨那一派，或並沒有什麼黨派只代表了自己，我們都無暇追問，好得老百姓最好不過，只要眞能安居樂業，隨便諸公擺佈，但諸公開會總得先有一共守的原則，至少辦到「言而有信」。否則縱一時騙得了自己，却瞞不過天下人的耳目。假使任何人說了話可不算數，連普通朋友都不能做；還組什麼黨？還協什麼商？共黨在未開會前早已大事宜傳願即「無條件停戰」，說話甜蜜極了！諸公愛聽，我們也愛聽。可是目前停火命令頒下多天，電報傳單可達窮鄉僻壤，而何以國軍開入瀋陽之日，共軍就攻其後路，佔營口，犯盤山？何以蘇皖魯豫冀熱依然一片戰雲？何以晋南共軍反而猛犯曲沃，綏遠共軍又去圍攻集寗？他若拆毀鐵路，破壞煤礦，何以作風不變，依然到處流行？共黨口口聲聲總說爲國爲民，老百姓也但願其如此。可是勝利了五個月，協商了近十天，而我們所聽到的還是開火，還是攻城，還是拆路，還是毀礦。縱然成立了軍事調處執行部，究竟誰能尊重服從？古人說，「美言不信」，「辯言不善」，我們到今天纔知「無條件停戰」的甘言蜜語，眞是太美了，太辯了！但諸公應該算一算：在這些美言辯言的麻醉之下，悠悠忽忽的日子過了多少，老百姓的生命財產犧牲了多少！老百姓有家歸不得，有苦無處說，到今天該有權利向「政協」諸公提出要求：您們不發言則已，要說就得有信，不但「言必行」，而且要「行必果」。諸公中的任何一人，不但要自己守信，且須負責不許他人失信。諸公如忘了這個前提，僅僅想在會塲上掉玄虛，參「話頭」，海闊天空，不求實際，說了話，出門不認貨，失了信，依然稱黨魁，則國人無負於諸公，而諸公實有負於國人。</p>
<p>其次，老百姓祗指望「還政於民，還軍於國。」這八個大字，也就是政府和共黨雙十會談紀要中所雙方同意的「政治民主化，軍隊國家化」十個大字。政協開會，諸公約責任，就在研討如何實現此八個大字或十個大字的步驟。舍此而外，諸公固無權過間；而舍此不圖，諸公亦將對不起國府的召集。還政於民，天經地義是要還政於老百姓，還政於國民大會，而非還政於那一黨那一派，或那幾黨那幾派，更非還政於隨便湊幾個人的什麼協商會議。黨也好，派也好，社也好，會也好，協商也好，會議也好，如果沒有經過老百姓的選舉，任何人不能自稱代表，可以接受國府的還政，任何會議不能存心來替代未來的國民大會。若並此不明，以爲結合了一幫人，就可吹擂上檯，自號民主，自以爲乃政權發源之所在，則今天「鄉村建設社」可以成派，明天「市政協會」何嘗不可以成派？今天「職業敎育社」可以成派，明天「兒童敎育社」何嘗不可以成派？今天「民主同盟」可以稱黨，明天「民主建國會」何嘗不可以稱黨？今天「民族解放行動委員會」可以稱黨。明天「中國勞動協會」何嘗不可以稱黨？今天諸公可以推許爲社會賢達，明天某某士紳某某工友又何嘗不是社會賢達，而社會賢達又豈祗限於此寥寥數人？諸公試思，若謂有了政協或參政會，就可緩開國民大會，有了黨派拉攏，就可改組政府，把國民大會延擱起來，寗不令人啞然失笑！國民政府本早定二十六年冬召集國民大會，徒因抗戰一再延期，大家旣要責望早日結束訓政，還政於民，自然只有五月五日如期召集國民大會的一法。今天老百姓，不容許國府再假借什麼口實失信於人民，而國民所依法選出的代表，更沒有理由聽令任何個人任何機關可以隨意否認取消。人苦於不自知！我們請那些高唱取消代表論者，先自行檢點一番，他們憑什麼資格可以放言高論，否認國民選舉的代表！我們以爲政府是否誠意還政於民，就是看它是否仍如期召開國民大會，而政協諸公是否誠意協商還政於民，也就要看會議是否能商定五月五日召開國民大會的具體辦法。</p>
<p>至於「還軍於國」，那更簡單了。所謂還軍於國，就是任何黨派，個人，或地方不許有軍隊，只許國家有軍隊，換句話，只許中央政府堂有軍政軍令的大權。根據此點，任何軍隊的整編，訓練，調遣，銓叙，經理等等，都完全由應中央政府決定。現在國軍部隊旣早已撤廢國民黨的黨部，其指揮又向屬於國家的最高統帥，則目前所須解次的，就是一個共黨軍隊的整編問題。不容許東扯西拉，迴避主題。張羣氏曾說共軍如不整編就緒，則停止衝突並不能算就可永久和平。老百姓所關心，幾年來懸而未次的，就是這「待價而估」的共軍如何歸束。去年春季政府與共黨代表西安會商時，共黨要求編十二個師，政府也允許編十個師，後來毛澤東氏到重慶，共黨忽又要求編四十八個師，一再磋商至少要二十個師。他國在戰後祗有裁兵，共黨在戰後反要增兵，奇怪之至！而且共黨要求其軍隊必須駐防何地，官佐必須由其保舉，果如所云，則「還軍於國」其名，而「留軍於黨」其實！老百姓的要求很簡單明瞭，政府整編共軍，不妨商酌數目，而整編以後，防地如何，給養如何，官佐如何，訓練調遣如何，應與一般國軍絕對一律，不得有絲毫例外，否則與周室封建唐代藩鎭何異？而且整編軍隊一事，原定另組三人軍事小組進行商洽，而共黨此時偏變花樣又要拉到「政協」裏去拖延時日，誠意如何，信用如何？共黨代表陸定一總說「逼上梁山」，就算逼吧，那末「梁山」好漢旣然要求「招安」，也得早日卸下他們所久已獨樹的一幟！政協諸公如果只知敷衍遷就，只圖個一時好看，不促成軍事小組即日進行整編共軍，勢必大背「還軍於國」的眞義，次不是老百姓的期望。</p>
<p>我們老百姓，八年來苦也受够了！受暴敵宰割之苦，受奸逆壓迫之苦！受不肖官吏敲榨之苦，受土匪游雜騷擾之苦，受共軍攻城掠地拆路毀礦之苦，受漢奸僞幣剝削之苦，更受共軍迫用「抗幣」掠取物資之苦！…來日大難，吃苦不盡！今天光明一綫，盡在「政協」，我們謹代老百姓垂涕而道，向「政協」呼籲，希望諸公眞能如周恩來氏所說，「對國家負責，對人民負責」，大家憑良心，說公話，認眞商定辦法，立刻停火，並且催促政府還政於民，督責共黨還軍於國。那一方面失信，願與天下共棄之！</p>
<p>法華鎮漆黑一團</p>
<p>編輯先生：敝區位處滬西（名曰法華鎭），分稱東·中·西鎭。東通海格路陸家路口，西達大西路及凱旋路。全鎭長約三里許，商店林立，人口衆多。在戰前，原有路燈。自國軍西移後，處於敵寇之蹂躪下。多不完整。嗣再受敵僞之燈火管制，復迫而拆毀。於是夜晚全鎭幾入於黑漆世界。在此時期，更有匪徒乘間夜出，掠人財物，或剝取衣衫，行途之苦，莫此爲甚。自本市光復以後，聞當局已開始將各區路燈次第裝設，但未聞敝區有此籌劃。敝區民衆渴念光明，爲特　請有關當局，迅賜裝設。關於治安，略可小補。深望當局採納，則法華全區人民幸甚！法華鎭一市民陶子淵謹啓。</p>

<h3>多頭逢高了結　金市人心平淡　新港票繼續下游</h3>
<p>烚赤　昨初開平盤，近日謠傳新匯率種種揣測，字林西報及本報均有財政當局　謠之訊登載，人心略由興奮轉入平淡，故開後雖見九三萬六，逢高不乏多頭了結，川帮銀行亦有供　，不久即復下游，美鈔始終鬆濫，套價六二五元，金市有套賣頭寸塞出，盤跌至九一萬三，此後求供漸趨均衡，市況遂轉入平穩，在九二萬內外大事排徊，午刻仍無變化，後市現期均在九二萬光景小有起仆，結果較前收回跌八千，銀樓飾金掛九萬九，紋銀七百元，銀元盤旋於四百六，暗拆息價仍自八分至一角一分不等，惟頭寸不多，證金兩帮仍感緊迫，烚赤不若股債範圍之狹窄，大戶想盡方法，對現市價格仍未滿意，業中漸有乘機出籠者，前途雖將拉抬，恐多盤旋。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔仍　特殊刺激，實貨不斷流出，上場時對黃金之套價竟達六二五元左右，是以逢低有套買，過程雖在跌勢下，尚極平和，自一五〇〇元後隨金價而步小，午刻及午後在一四八〇元內外呆滯，套價稍形軋攏，最後的六二〇元對十兩，港幣老貨以廣帮需求而回好十元，新貨則因浮多失望，續有了結，廣帮在此價格並無納胃，繼續下游，結果較前收再挫三元。</p>

<h3>棉布交易零星　川幫吸收淺色貨</h3>
<p>日昨棉布市況巳較穩定，士林藍布，漢口帮略有成交，然因前已有信孚·新豐等廠少量開出，而現貨留滯於市者尚多，致造成供求平衡之勢，益以年關在邇，亟須煞車，暫告段落，至川帮猶絡續吸收條子府綢等淺色貨，以備開春行銷，除此以外，均是零星交易，點綴市場而已，白坯細布　子依然緊俏，故染織廠對有鉅額現貨者納胃頗殷。</p>

<h3>為僅校學費問題　市教局召校長談話　已商得折中辦法</h3>
<p>〔大華社訊〕本市敎育局爲解決私校收費問題，特於昨日下午二時，在該局召開私立中小學校長談話會，計到民國，愛國，明德，道中，存德，正風等三百餘校，出席顧局長，各處處長，敎育部程督學寬正。首由顧局長報告，略謂：私校經濟之困難，本人亦深明一切，前由局方規定之收費標準，雖與各校商定者相差甚遠，惟曾根據各家長之負擔爲定。如此以數全部分配教員，則生活方面似可無問題，至於學校辦公費，局方原擬　成各校　負責，現知校董方面均無可維持，本局當請求市長協助，使本市敎育日臻發展，至於增加學費，市府局方原可不加顧問，其奈家長無力負擔何，最好折中辦理，一方面請向家長勸募，局方當不加干涉。嗣蔣紀周，孫翔仲，崔堅吾，魏敦義等代表私校歷陳困難數點，由顧局長分別答覆：</p>
<p>局長意見</p>
<p>（第一點）從前所採用者，乃蘇聯之收費辦法，蘇聯學校全屬公立，故情形稍異，可無困難，本市情形不同，故此項辦法，當俟市參議會成立後商討實行。（第二點）前所規定學費標準爲恐受輿論指摘，以及體念家長負擔，乃有市銀行之貸金辦法，並擬請求市長，准予小學增收二千，初中三千，高中四千，另請經濟寬裕之家長捐助免費學額及設備。繼由敎部程督學報告謂：渝市府前對於私校學費曾加限制，高中學費，最高一萬五千元，不足之數由校董會負責，上海情形特殊，校董能負此項責任者甚少，今各校主持者能與主管機關互相開誠佈公討論，足為上海教育前途慶幸。</p>
<p>私校要求</p>
<p>後再由私校提出要求數頃：（一）第二學期要求市府發給五千四百　補助費，（二）請以敵偽產業之一部份，提作各校損失補助與賠償，（三）市府提撥學校經費，事實上不能充分，因市府收入之百分之五十，已充警局經費，待市參議會成立後，當請求增加。末由顧局長答稱：本人當儘力向有關方面接洽，至於收費方面，如認為仍有困難，本人仍願贊助設法云云。故下學期私校學費如不再更改，約數當爲小學八千元，初中一萬二千元，高中一萬六千元。</p>
<h3>簡報</h3>

<h3>黑白隊臨去秋波　昨一分擊敗晨　紅　鉀肥友杯協興汕隊告捷</h3>
<p>晨友盃籃球甲組賽，昨晚有二幕角逐，壓軸另由遠征軍黑白出馬與晨友紅會師，故觀衆慕名而來者極爲踴躍，中靑房內，人氣狂熱。</p>
<p>首場聯賽東華對協興，前者表演不弱，協與竟難以取勝，前半形成拉鋸局，分數相差僅在一二分之間，故卒戰成各十七平等局面。休息後，仍呈膠着狀態，東華雖有張邦綸，張林根先後四次犯規罰出，惟戰鬥力仍不減，直至終場，協興僅以卅四對卅二小勝二分。</p>
<p>繼之汕隊戰綠林，局勢亦極緊張，緣林小將演出優怫，強勁如汕隊，亦感棘手，上半時八比九，綠林僅落後一分。易籃後，汕隊漸見得手，綠林則心餘力絀，迨終場鑼聲大鳴，汕隊以廿二對十四告捷，保持常勝榮譽。</p>
<p>末場以　黑白對　友紅，後者以逸待勞，故　　後，即一路領前，上半時以十五對八遙領。休息再戰，晨紅輕敵，頻　　將，被黑白乘機而起，最後一分鐘，姚洪森命中，竟以卅三對卅二反敗為勝，克服晨紅。</p>
<p>黑白隊此番來滬，計出戰四場，勝負參半，戰　尚佳，而運動精神尤屬良好，頗　球迷擁戴。現以在此戰程已畢，定今日離滬返錫。</p>
<p>昨晚三場結果如下：</p>
<p>協興勝東華（甲）三四比三二</p>
<p>汕隊勝綠林（甲）二二比十四</p>
<p>黑白勝晨紅（友）三三比三二</p>

<p>懷着一支興奮而誠摯的心情，在一個晴朗的冬天底下午，筆者到達國立社會敎育學院臨時院址所在地的四川璧山。璧山，這一個不聞名的小小的山城，靜靜地躺在離重慶西北六十餘公里的山圍中，渝成公路，蜿蜒地從這兒經過。學院就位於城內西北角的高坡上。當我爬上了百十級石級，在兩列夾道的古木間，「國立社會教育學院」的校牌就輝煌地展開在我的眼前。</p>
<p>悠揚的鋼琴聲似在迎接我這個來訪的客人。大門內是一片坦闊的操場，許多同學們正在活躍地進行各類球賽。操塲的四週，表現得十分整潔，到處洋溢着活潑和諧的空氣。</p>
<p>陳禮江為院長</p>
<p>見到了陳禮江院長，在一間幽潔樸素的客室裏。陳先生是中國的一個權威敎育學者，他從事社會敎育工作將近二十年了，中國社會敎育能有今日的發展，他盡了最大的保育之功；在社會敎育理論底建立上，在社會敎育事業底推進上，他都有不可磨滅的貢獻。他有着典型的敎育者底風度，愷悌慈祥，落落大方，談笑間四座風生，這說明了他學養底豐富，生命力底充沛。他對一般青年似乎蘊藏着一種感人的力量，這得，使一個陌生的人覺到親熱，一個熟悉的人覺到溫暖</p>
<p>國立社會敎育學院，成立於民國三十年底秋天，迄今僅有四年的歷史。當它創立之始，即有江蘇省立敎育學院及大夏大學敎育學院社會敎育系三四年級學生奉令併入該院，所以到現在已有四屆畢業學生三百餘人，散佈在全國許多社敎機關及學校，發揮了該院底敎育精神，博得社會上一般的好評。</p>
<p>專家們的貢獻</p>
<p>若干有名的學者專家們，都來參加這個事業底開創。陳禮江先生自從該院開辦以來就是他主持，此外如莊澤宜，杜佐周，邱椿，許德珩，常　之，陳劍　，姜琦，陳東原，俞頌華，童潤之，朱亦松，呂鳳子，董治川，焦菊隱，張駿祥，劉雪厂諾先生，都曾貢獻過或正在貢獻他們最大的精力與智慧，促使這事業更高地發展。</p>
<p>該院現有四個學系，三個專修科，一個學組，即社會教育行政學系，社會事業行政學系，圖書博物館學系，新聞學系，電化敎育專修科，藝術教育專修科，國語敎育專修科及禮俗行政組。在編制上，禮俗行政組是附設於社會事業行政學系的，不過這一組的人數特別多，在形式上成了獨立的班級。</p>
<p>學生來自各地</p>
<p>學生來自全國各地，除新疆台灣二省及蒙古西藏二地方外，其餘各省市。雖然他們來自不同的地方，有不同的生活習慣，也有不同的信仰，可是在這敎育環境中，共同生活，共同學習，相處得十分和諧，十分親密。學生待遇一律公費。學膳等費免繳，且按月有零用金及每期有制服費發給，此外並設有多種獎學金，以鼓勵學生教品勵學，研究與創作。學生一切生活均甚規律，舉凡起居·飲食·升旗早操·作業，都有一種自動的紀律。在作業室，在圖書館，在俱樂部，在體育塲，於整齊嚴肅之中，充滿朝氣蓬勃之象。各種研究會，文化走廊邊的十幾種壁報，講演·論文·體育·生產·社會服務……等的競賽，提高了他們各方面的興趣，加强了他們底求知慾和進取心。</p>
<p>學校即社會化</p>
<p>學校與社會打成一片，他們做得相當澈底。在這個環境裏，可以看得到「學校社會化。社會教育化」底現象，已相當發揮了「學校為社會文化中心」底功能，。舉例來說：他們先後辦了六屆中學程度的補習班，十餘所民眾學校，幾十所民衆問事處；在寒署假期中，舉行民衆訪問及農村經濟，農民生活與敎育程度等底調查；辦理職業介紹；輔導地方政府開展建設工作；聯絡社會團體從事各種民衆活動；經常放映電影，公演話劇，舉行美術展覽，照片展覽，音樂演奏，以招待民眾；裝置飛機，公布重要電訊，向民衆報導新聞消息；並特別注意圖書推廣事業，設立了幾十所書報閱覽處，舉辦巡迴文庫。這許多工作，他們都脚踏實地在幹。</p>
<p>公開學科選習</p>
<p>大學教育底推廣，該院也已在中國樹立了一種新的楷模。最主要的是「公開學科選習」，與「公開學術講演」。公開學科選習，是爲一般大學程度的失學靑年及在職的公敎人員，有機會學習其所急切需要的學識技能，該院各系學程凡敎室有餘位而爲一股院外靑年所需要者一律開放，任其選習，並供給講義及參考資料，四年來，選習學程達五十餘科，選習學生計共六百餘人。公開學術講演，是敦請國內外名流學者來院講演，先日對院外公開通知，歡迎民衆自由聽講，四年來共講演六十八次，院外聽衆約計三萬餘人。此外還舉辦「專題解答」，民衆如有學術或按術上底專門問題，可以向學院提請解答或直接同某一敎授商討；組織「社會敎育通訊研究社」，輔導社會敎育從美人員研究進修。</p>
<p>推廣委員設計</p>
<p>上述的許多民敎事業及推廣工作，大都由「推廣委員會」設計執行。在學術研究方面，則有「研究部」的設立，作爲研究社會敎育學術與社會敎育方法底中心機構。現在主持研究部的是名敎育學者莊澤宣先生。研究部底工作是協導師生研究社會敎育各方面底問題，也可以說是研究中國社會各方面底問題；鼓勵學生組織各種學術團體，以提高其研究興趣，同時聯絡院外專家，從事集體研究工作。最近一年來，側重於戰後中國社會敎育建設底研究，對戰後中國社會底變動，社會敎育如何配合這些變動，以及如何使社會敎育領導中國教育底改造，都有精闢的結論。在本年下期出版的兩期「敎育與社會」（該院編輯的刋物名稱現已出至第四卷），就是這一研究底報告。</p>
<p>主要附屬機關</p>
<p>這裏要附帶叙述一點關於該院的附屬機關，主要的有國民敎育實騐區，實騐社會服務處，附屬中學，及附屬社會敎育師範等。</p>
<p>自國民教育實施後，失學民眾補習教育已正式列入學制系統，令在實施中所發生的困難問題及解決方法。實騐社會服務處，是在實騐縣單位社會服務事樂底設施。附屬中學在實騐，以中學為縣單位地方文化底中心，期對今後的中學敎育有一澈底的改革。社會教育師範學校，是訓練中級社會教育人才的，將來各省將普遍設立，該院底附屬社會教育師範，是在實騐社會教育師範學校底課程與做法，以作為全國各省社會教育師範學校底示範，並希望尋求出整個師範敎育改革底途徑。</p>
<p>今後發展計劃</p>
<p>現抗戰已獲得了最後的勝利，而建國工作則來日方長，今後的建國工作，國立社會教育學院必有最大的發揮，在復員計劃中，該院底永久校址設立在南京　霞山。現在，陳院長已擬訂了該院最近五年的發展計劃，準備於本年添設體育，電化敎育，美術敎育，戲劇敎育，及音樂敎育等五個學系。明年添設生計敎育，及衛生敎育兩個學系，生計敎育學系，包括合作，工藝，農業推廣，地政等組，側重於民生經濟方面，衛生敎育學系，側重於鄉村衛生人員底訓練。第三年將圖書博物館學系，分爲圖書館學系，與博物館學系；電化敎育學系，分爲電影敎育學系，與播音敎育學系。第四第五年分別添設勞工敎育，家事敎育……等學系。而現有的專修科仍繼續辦理。</p>
<p>社會教育是推進新建設底基本力量，而國立社會敎育學院正是這個基本力量底中心泉源。</p>
<p>新中國建設底前途是美麗的，工作是艱巨的，我們以無窮的希望寄付給中國社會敎育，寄付給在艱苦奮鬥中長大的國立社會敎育學院。　（卅五年一月十五日於重慶）</p>

<p>開闢鎮寗路</p>
<p>滬西愚園路中正西路一帶，地勢低窪，原有溝渠，又欠完善，每遇蒙雨，輒有積水之患。市工務局迭經查勘，認為欲杜該區水患非開闢鎮寗路，另行設置新溝渠以導雨水疏洩於蘇州河內，不足收標本兼治之效。查鎮寗路自中正西路白宮殯儀館起，沿漁光村，越愚園路，再經六六八弄，直達梵王渡路止，全長八百四十公尺。原在民國二十年上海市政府公佈之滬西道路系統範圍內，當時規定寬度為十五公尺，決仍照原定路綫及寬度施工，並敷設溝渠，鋪築路面，以資排水，而利交通。</p>

<h3>敵軍登陸艇　改充市輪渡</h3>
<p>市公用局負責人稱：本市浦江交通工具，至為缺乏，一部份仍賴舢舨渡船，前由海軍總司令部接收之日軍用登陸艇兩艘，移撥上海市輪渡應用，業經改裝修理完竣，並於昨日舉行試航，成績不惡。聞已由市輪渡籌備處劃定航綫參加航行以便利交通。</p>

<h3>張曉崧談　整編保甲意義　發揮民眾自治精神</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據市府民政處處長張曉崧談稱：本市整編保甲工作自本月十五日開始以來，已歷數日，一般情形，堪稱良好，惟有一部份市民，被任為甲長或保長時，頗多不願就職，渠稱過去敵偽盤踞時期，良善或有識之士，為不屑與敵偽合作，故多避免任職，茲者天日重光，中央推行保甲制度，目的在</p>
<p>鼓勵民眾自治此點自民國二十八年中央頒佈縣以下各級組織綱要，實施新縣制度，更見具體話，故保甲制度即被容納於自治組織之中。過去敵偽自上而下的連坐連保法，現決澈底剷除，因而對一切防止盜匪，肅淸煙毒，修整橋路，充實藝術等等措施，市民須充份利用保甲基層機構之保民大會，將意見採納到保甲公約上去，</p>
<p>以憑參酌施行充分發揮民眾自治精神。渠繼稱過去上海飽經數十年租界之統制，又經八年敵偽盤踞，市民對我國政治實情，不盡瞭解，此番整編保甲，着眼於發揮民眾自治精神，故亟盼全市民，為本身及本市之事務，多負責任。</p>

<h3>敵偽產業處理局　查獲日方隱匿物資　白煤钟表市房及大量瓷器</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局查緝組最近續獲大批日方隱匿之物資。計有白煤五百餘噸，日商地產公司所有吳淞路市房一百十一幢，貴重金表二百九十隻，鍾十只，及價值偽幣二十一萬萬元以上之大批瓷器。此外前上海憲兵隊長姜公美私藏之物資，亦續有發現，茲將各情分誌如下：</p>
<p>五百噸煤　密埋地下</p>
<p>目前該組接獲密報，謂有大批白煤埋藏於江　市中心菜田下，當經派員前往察勘，計在市中心前佔地約一百十立方公尺之菜田內，掘出白煤約計五百餘噸。經查悉該煤係屬日商靑柳洋行所有，而於日人投降時，秘密埋於地下。並為避免耳目起見，仍出租於附近農戶，種植蔬菜。迄今五月餘，該農戶尚不知其地下有埋藏如許白煤云。</p>
<p>鉅值金表　市房百幢</p>
<p>又據報，吳淞路平田鍾表行二樓室內，藏有名牌貴重金表，及吳淞路沿街市房一百十一幢，均屬日人所有。經調查後，果在平田行二樓特製之機關內，搜出金表二百九十隻，大鍾十只。並贗品翡翠鑽石無數。該組為昭鄭重起對，特請上級派員監點，一併移送中央銀行保管。至房地產查係日商地產公司資產，而化以國人姓名，以圖逃避。現已呈報處理局，聽候處理。</p>
<p>大批瓷器　值千萬元</p>
<p>至於瓷器，共計在吳淞路百老匯路等三處私人堆棧內搜出，其價值估計約在偽幣二十一萬萬元以上，（合法幣一千餘萬元）。</p>
<p>查獲物資　二十卡車</p>
<p>其他關於前上海憲兵隊長姜公美隱藏之物資，亦續有所獲，惟尚在調查中，不便發表。總之該組最近來每日依據密報而查獲之物資，約計有二十卡車之多。</p>
<h3>勝利號輪　今日接收　不舉行儀式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局預定前日開始接收之自由輪，命名海蘇號，臨時船員發生細故，因之改期，上項問題昨已解決。接收第一艘勝利號（改名海蘇），今晨決可實行。該局已與美海軍當局約妥，定今晨七時，美方代表蒞局，會同全體船員，乘預備之小輪國利號，前往辦理交接。聞手續簡單，並不舉行儀式，又第一批三六自由輪之大副·二副·輪機·管車等，今日起每日上午八時至下午五時，前往各輪視察，如有不瞭解之處，可隨時詢問在船船員。該局昨特發給證明，便利登輪之用，一俟成熟，進行接收。</p>
<p>滬通綫輪　應差上駛</p>
<p>上江復員需船孔亟，行駛滬通綫等船舶，江定·江昌·遠豐等輪，均被徴發，日內即將上駛應差，滬通綫今日停航，僅滬與拖帶鐵駁，運貨駛天生港，並不搭客。</p>
<p>運煤船隻　仍極缺乏</p>
<p>據上海區燃料管理委員會消息，華北開業煤礦之生產量，現已逐漸增加，每日約有四千餘噸運至秦皇島，惟目前運滬煤斤，因輪隻缺乏，每週僅有二艘自由輪由秦皇島裝運煤斤來滬，每月數類約為八萬噸。淮南煤礦亦因當局努力結果，產量亦加增加，每日約可出產一千噸，惟因運輸船隻問題，每日僅有七百噸左右運至蚌埠。南京方面每月所能獲得之淮煤僅二萬噸，不敷應用，故需上海方面之煤斤接濟。</p>
<h3>美款匯華　未付美鈔　港幣折美匯傳說不確</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨據本市美商銀行負責人吿本報記者：美對華匯款在過去旬日中已略有收到唯皆係零星數額，該款項皆由該行津滬分行開給紐約即期電匯或郵匯。截至目前止，該行等因外匯限制關係尚未撥付美鈔。昨日本市各報皆刊載中央社紐約專電稱美匯暫定以港幣二十五元，折合美元一元計算，據該行負責人吿記者：該項傳說，與事實完全不符。</p>
<h3>臨時公共汽車　增開第二綫　貫通南市閘北</h3>

<h3>尚賢堂婦孺醫院　突被封鎖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕杜美路尚賢堂婦孺醫院　立垂二十年，十四日有軍人某，聲稱欲收回房屋，通知該院於二十日前，將病人全部遷出，該院因覓房不易，未尤其請，某即聲稱將以武力對付，並派兵士數名，予以全部「封鎖」，禁止病人醫師出入。據悉該院已將是案經過，呈報本市主管長官，請求保障。</p>
<h3>吳開先昨飛渝</h3>

<h3>復興釘廠主人　章啟品昨提訊</h3>

<h3>轟炸東京美飛行員　述被俘遭虐待經過　尼羅遜上尉昨招待報界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕以轟炸東京聞名全球之美杜立德將軍屬下尼羅遜上尉，昨日下午三時，假百老匯大廈二樓，招待本市中外記者，敘述其於一九四二年四月十八日首次轟炸東京後，被日軍所俘經過。</p>
<p>歸途油罄　被迫降落</p>
<p>尼上尉，年二十九歲，於本月十三日由美來滬，擬參加此處審訊曾殺害三美飛行員之日戰犯。尼氏曾備受日人荼毒，屆時即可為一重要證人。</p>
<p>一九四二年四月十八日，尼氏與其他八十美飛行員，分乘十六架B—二五機，奉命轟炸東京。尼氏乘第十六號機最後離朝鮮，歸途中因汽油告罄，該機跌落寗波近郊。尼氏與飛機師霍莫，副機師米達，為僅以身免者。三日後，彼等被日軍隊所俘，送交日憲兵隊，被解至東京受審。在東京並遇十五號機中所生存之數飛行員，緣十五號機亦因缺乏汽油而降落者。</p>
<p>監禁獄中　飽受荼毒</p>
<p>時年六月，彼等被解至上海，以戰爭罪犯被禁於橋頭大廈。獄中飽受非人道待遇，起初四十日內竟不准彼等沐浴，後日軍又將彼等全部人員轉解江灣軍監，惟機師霍莫則因身受重傷不能同行。</p>
<p>嗣後日方舉行軍事審判，然並無譯員，彼等中無一人能譜日語者。十月十五日，曾最後一次見到霍莫，聞其與另二人將解至另一集中營，此後即聞已遭殺害。</p>
<p>日投降後，尼氏等一行於北平被釋，即由美營救隊營救送返本國，然在北平時，曾聞日人謂彼等曾轟炸日教堂，醫院及學校等，而事實上此種宣傳純係與事實不符。彼等僅轟炸東京灣北部日兵工廠，油塲等，而始終未使用機關槍。</p>
<p>體重減輕　約六十磅</p>
<p>尼氏在獄中共居四十月，體重減輕六十磅，後返家休養，由其母預備優良飲食，現體重已復增三十五磅。尼氏至今尚未婚。此次重見上海，身體幸得自由行動，與當年相比，判若兩人。此來參加審判，決以一切事實揭露，協助海德齡上校及陶埃上尉進行工作。一俟任務完畢，即擬返國居家，再行休養一時。其同難者第歇澤（Dieshper）上士，認為日本之侵略戰禍，全因所受教育錯誤。現該上士已入一教會學校攻讀，渠決於畢業後赴日本，以教會立場改善一部分日本之教育。</p>
<p>日本戰犯　即將受審</p>
<p>此次參加危害美飛行員之日人共計七人，中二人係中將，一上校，四上尉。現有一上尉在南京，一在新加坡，四人在日本，在上海者僅上尉一人，即係執行槍殺美飛行員者，至審判日期，將於下兩週內舉行。</p>
<h3>本年四月底前　半數美軍返國</h3>

<h3>南市南方劇塲　昨晚肇事　傷士兵三名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚九時許南市蓬萊市塲西側南方劇塲因禁吸香煙問題，發生衝突，終至開槍相擊。結果有士兵邵甘潘，徐志榮，受槍傷外，另有駐於小西門附近之交通崗營劉守民聞聲趕往，但行未數步，突被一軍人奪下手槍，即用其槍連開二槍，將劉擊傷倒地，事後送入醫院救治，彈中腹部，性命垂危，詳情正由關係當局詳查中。</p>

<h3>房地捐調查估價　需一年後完竣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃自財政局方面探悉：此次徴收房地捐，係根據房屋租賃管理委員會之決定，普通住宅估價，均照戰前加四十倍計算，凡生產性之地產如公寓·旅館·商店等。則加六十倍計算，再照此項估價收百分之十四之捐稅，房主房客，各半負擔。本年收租，凡有底冊可稽者，已照此加倍估價徴收，但若干底冊業已散佚之房屋，自須派員分頭調查估價，本市幅員廣眾，全市房屋總數達二十萬戶之多，調查頗費時日，故目前業已估價竣事者，僅滬西·市中心·馬當三區，均已開始徴收。其他各區，估價雖容或較遲，但一旦估價完竣之後，繳納稅捐，概須自去年冬季以前起徴。記者旋詢此項估價何時可以全部完竣，據答恐須一年以上。</p>

<h3>新中國的干城　靑年軍到上海　以未能手刃敵人為恨</h3>
<p>— 本報記者素人</p>
<p>「如果可能，我也真想參加你們的隊伍，」道別時，我握着一位靑年軍軍士強勁的手說。彼此的眼光凝視着，心底的感情在交流。　光景：「落日照大旗，馬鳴風蕭蕭，」但現在不是征人出塞，而是壯士凱旋的時候了。黃浦江洶湧的潮水，奏着歡迎的曲子，「鴻大」船甲板上擁擠着佩帶「雄獅」臂章的雄士，是新中國的干城，世界和平的樑柱。船桅上國旗在飄揚，映着落日，那一派莊嚴。華美，呌人不敢逼視。</p>
<p>十萬大軍</p>
<p>我先到江灣復且大學，靑年遠征軍二〇七師師部所在地。羅又倫師長公出，劉少峯教育長正患着傷風，從床上爬起來招待。劉將軍是軍校七期畢業，曾做過報館編輯，短小精悍，但極其和藹可親，而好做一大羣靑年學生的師長。他娓娓地敘述靑年軍的一切，如何為了計劃總反攻而號召知識靑年從軍，一年後如何在昆明開始訓練，二〇一到二〇九師十萬大軍，剛準備誓師出擊，日本卻投降了。他說這是一個不能彌補的遺憾，自各師長至每一個士兵，都以不曾手刃敵人為恨；但反過來，我們也正該為國家慶幸，留下這一批軍隊的精華，多保存了國家一分元氣。</p>
<p>全師萬餘人，於去年十月十五日，自昆明出發。走公路到漢口，才搭船來上海。在漢口耽擱了不少日子，漢水·洞庭等曾留下他們的足跡，連營數百，沿江排列。數日前奉命來　接防，才開始感趕運，所以現在師部裏有二種軍隊，新六軍廿二師要到明天上午才能全數開出。靑年軍前天到了一團，今天又到一團。新到的一團只能委曲他們在船上在過一夜，江上的明月也許更美麗，請勇士們多多領略。</p>
<p>軍紀嚴明</p>
<p>事先曾經有人懷疑學生從軍的紀律，後來事實的表演，一天比一天好。起先他們也許還有一些少爺脾氣，但現在，他們任何苦役都親自動手。一眼望去，你只當他們是平常的小兵，要仔細看，才能感覺到每一位都有書卷氣，於是你更不能不為他們的艱苦卓絕而吃驚。</p>
<p>在廣塲上拍了幾張照片後，劉將軍邀我同到碼頭上視察新到的部隊。在那裏會到六二〇團團長龐宗儀將軍，龐將軍很威武，但對人也同樣和善。他們商量以後，命令全體軍士不得上岸，再留在船上宿一夜，這工作很快地就完成了。</p>
<p>精神飽滿</p>
<p>我站在甲板上望着他們走動，談笑，搬運，每一個人都是精神飽滿。你看：新中國開始成長，誰說我們的軍隊素質低下？靑年軍那一些比上不人家？願國家迅速向和平團結之途邁進，將來全部軍隊都會到一樣的水準。再為上海慶幸得到這一支軍隊的保護，全體市民會改變他們對軍人的態度，知識靑年也會認識從軍的光榮。等他們一年以後受完軍官的教育，將會有另一批靑年接上去，請他們來帶領。那時候，建軍工作成功，國家的安全與世界的和平，都有了確切的保障。</p>
<p>願靑年遠征軍日益京進，繼續為全國的軍隊作一個模範。</p>

<h3>整理笑話材料</h3>
<p>— 王煥白</p>
<p>有許多事情，雖然我們看上去覺得不足注意，其實倒恰恰相反，我們是不應該置諸不顧的。對於小事抱着忽略態度的人，我認爲他能成功大事業的可能性一定很少，所以從種種雞零狗碎的事情上着眼，還不算是多此一舉。我現在要提出來的一個意見—整理笑話材料，意思也就在此。</p>
<p>人有遊戲的動機，笑是屬於這動機中的一種動作。人在快樂的時候，會情不自禁地面露笑容，這便是遊戲動機的滿足。我們知道一個終年扳面吼過日子的人，雖在旁人看來有嚴肅感，但在自己是痛苦的。惟有能够每天笑口常開，纔是人生最有意義的事。所以，有人提議一天之中必須大笑三次，眞是至理名言。</p>
<p>我們旣已曉得笑對於人生有這麼大的作用，那末，爲何不把握住笑的泉源，使我們隨時隨地皆可以得到笑的資料呢？——聰明的人早就想出辦法，即是把可笑的事實收集攏來，再一起貢獻給別人。在美國影城好萊塢，有一個專收集笑話的圖書館，裏面藏有千萬冊笑話書籍，供人閱讀。我們在上海所看到的美國影片中，常有不少的有趣穿插，引人大笑，那些資料當然非幾個編劇與導演想得出的，大半可說皆來自那個圖書館。</p>
<p>我們中國自古流傳到今日的笑話頗多，祗因有些性質近乎低級，有些含有典故，於是爲大家看不起了，到現在，我們却歡迎西洋的東西。實際上，中國的笑話中並不乏內容極佳的，好的可以說有很多很多，爲什麼不編輯起來，印出公之於世呢？</p>
<p>整理笑話材料，在目下正是一樁有益於社會的工作，如果有熱心的人肯担任，不妨先搜求一下所有的笑話，然後再擇其意義良好又富於趣味的，費點工夫，重加修改，我想總不至於怎樣困難吧。</p>
<p>民國</p>
<h3>靈驗的童謠</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>說起童謠，似乎由來已久，記載史冊的也很多。我們不是考古，也不必舊事重提；惟自民國以還，有幾首童謠，倒也値得一提。</p>
<p>民十五年秋，那時夏超爲浙江省長，他本是省會警察廳長，孫傳芳驅盧永祥，代爲督理，夏超由是升任。當時有『　子回頭，夏超斬頭』的童謠。十六年孫傳芳做五省聯軍總司令，坐鎭南京。北伐軍興，與大戰於南昌，而以浙督畀盧香亭接充。夏超爲應響北伐，拒聯軍於嘉興，無奈佈置未週，敗退杭州，後來竟被盧香亭所執而遇害，此　非是盧永祥，實是盧香亭，童謠居然又騐。當時軍閥方面，吳佩孚最倔强，而江南民間早有童謠流行：『一二三四五，打倒吳佩孚，六七八九十，歡迎　蔣介石』。果然威名所及，軍閥望風披靡。童謠又騐。在九一八時，日寇把我們的東北區當作他們的生命綫，竟敢侵略，驅軍直入，東北由是淪陷。惟民心不死，當時有童謠傳唱：『說東洋，話東洋，東洋鬼子不久長。』總算强佔了十四年，到底屈服投降，還我東北，童謠成了事實。八一三日寇進犯，夢想併吞我國，想以大東亞主人自居，羨得軸心國眼紅，掀起第二次世界大戰。又有童謠流行：『打倒東洋人，死脫外國人』。甚至傳說唱這童謠的兒童被日寇灌水剖腹慘殺，連父母同死非命。童謠還是應騐，日寇果然被打倒，而外國人之死於戰事以及納粹慘殺者，着實不少。近來還有一首童謠在傳唱着，『東洋人，死脫哉，孫中山，活轉來。』這是什麼意思？想上句已騐，下句的解釋，可說是總理遺志實行，完成建國大業。那麼總理雖死猶生，等於活轉來一般。</p>
<p>按童謠之流行與應騐，實際是根據民衆心理，並非迷信。蓋人同此心，凡心之所想，傳之於口，大家作會心的傳唱，大家在促進實現，那得不騐呢！</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>我教大學生</h3>
<p>— 沉毅</p>
<p>今天在我們銀行裏，來了一個剛畢業的大學生；據說他讀的是某著名大學的『機械工程系』，我聽了不禁愕然。以這樣一個有資格，有技能，大學訓練出來的專門人才，來擔當像我們這些僅有普通學識就能應付的銀行職員的工作，那是太辜負了他十六年來辛苦攻讀所獲得的學識，也太埋沒了他那爲國家所需要，而且可以供國家充分應用的眞實本領了。</p>
<p>抱歉的是要我這樣一個不够資格做正式中學生的小職員，來敎一個堂堂的大學生關於各種銀錢賬務的收付和登記，好像有點太提高我的身份了。</p>
<p>但上司的命令，我無法違背，暫且衹能『榮譽』地來執行了這一個使命。奇怪的是這一使命並說使我感覺到絲毫的驕傲；相反的，我對他的舉動，却產生了無限的同情和敬佩。我們除了公事以外，沒有談到半句私話，我看到他那憂鬱沉默的臉，似含孕着內心無限的隱痛，於是正當我的問話要跳出喉嚨時，却又被唾液嚥了下去。他細心，謹愼，忍耐，努力地學着我所敎他的各種賬務。像這樣的重新學習的精神，使我感覺到有一種莫明其妙的窒息在折磨着我。</p>
<p>當辦公時間完畢後，他收拾了自己桌上的東西，有禮貌地和我說了『明天見』，走了。我目送着他那穿了布長衫的背影，覺到了茫然。</p>
<p>從一個同事口中，我知道他現在的家境甚爲困難，父親在去年死的，而他的大學課程是得到幾個親戚的帮助才完成的。大學畢業以後，聽說也曾考過一家著名的機械工程場，但是爲了投考人數太多，並且他沒有大的脚路和擔保，於是眞實的本領，並沒有使他找尋到眞正可以工作的地方。所以這次才由一位親戚介紹到我們銀行裏來。</p>
<p>聽完了這一段講話，使我深深地覺得：在今天的社會中找事情，資格和才能果然也要一部份，但是最需要的却是比資格和才能更有用的脚路和介紹。我爲這一『學非所用』的大學生可惜，但是有更多的大學生，他們畢業後，就徬徨在失業的飢餓綫上，我要喊：『救救大學生吧！』</p>

<h3>生活的遊戲</h3>
<p>— 一心</p>
<p>把自已的生活，看作一個頑皮孩子在參加一個極有興趣的遊戲。</p>
<p>任何遊戲中的規則，必須努力去學習，並且須時常的實習。尤其是生活的遊戲。</p>
<p>遊戲中，有熱忱才能得勝。所以生活必須有極大的熱忱。</p>
<p>你對工作所抱的態度，是一件很重要的事。你可是在做苦工，而恨你自已的工作？或者你是使工作成爲一種遊戲般可愛？</p>
<p>享樂的生活，或苦役般的生活，二者都是由你自己去選擇的。</p>
<p>使自己對於工作和生活感到快樂，是和使你厭惡他們一樣容易。</p>
<p>風土</p>
<h3>紐約馬迪遜花園</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉歷</p>
<p>在紐約第四十九街和第五十街間的第八路，坐落着一座世界最著名的運動場：馬迪遜花園。該園在去年十二月間慶祝遷到滿哈坦中部的二十週年紀念，這個運動場所以名滿寰球的一種原因，是因為所有各業的特出的競技人物，都曾在塲內大顯身手。像世界的溜冰皇后宋雅海妮是在該園開始她的職業溜冰生涯的。世界重量拳擊冠軍喬路易氏曾在該園保持他的冠軍達五次之多。世界著名的長程跑家，勞蘭的鈕爾米，美國的坎寗漢和瑞典的哈格都在該園的一百六十碼的木板跑道比賽過。雷塞蒂也在該園表演他那百發百中所向無敵的籃球。流氓蕭愛迪曾在該園比賽曲棒球時發生鬥毆兇案。還有那些馬戲中在空中戲繩翻跟斗的演技家，在該園獻藝時，因爲偶一不愼而當場殞命的。</p>
<p>每年都有很多運動會的冠軍或錦標隊願意在這個牆壁有消防設備的場內表演：像全國業餘體育聯合會的戶內田徑賽，全國籃球聯合比賽會，全國馬匹展覽會，衛士明思德家狗展覽會，世界牧牛錦標比賽會。</p>
<p>拳擊提倡家傑可士所主持的拳擊錦標賽，一向是在馬迪遜花園舉行的。好萊塢的溜冰比賽每年冬季是在那裏舉行的。全國曲棒球比賽是在該園的溜冰塲出演的。還有幾家的著名馬戲團每年春季必在該園獻技一個月之久。</p>
<p>凡　紐約觀光的旅客，對於該園佔了三十市區之大，都表示驚異。該園在馬迪遜方場西北。</p>
<p>該園於一八五七年開始其歷史，當時第一聯邦車站是築於馬迪遜花園附近。一八七一年鐵道當局放棄以該處爲鐵道的終點，這聯邦車站便改爲展覽廳，名爲吉爾摩花園，後來又改稱巴南馬戲場，最後在一八九七年才改爲馬迪遜花圍。一八九〇年就在那個地點建築新屋。</p>
<p>當時，馬迪遜花園是在紐的娛樂中心的北邊。該園的董事有銀行界巨擘摩根和巴南。其建築師懷德於一九〇六年在其屋頂花園被邵哈利槍殺。一八九六年勃萊燕在該花園接受民主黨全國大會選舉任總統候選人。一九二四年民生黨全國大會第二十九次會議時，已故美國總統羅斯福突然退出競選，把所得的票數讓給他的老友史密士，也是在那裏。把該園移到現在的地址的，是空前最卓越的事業家黎克德。</p>

<h3>強烈X光</h3>
<p>— 虞頌堯</p>
<p>兩三年前，美國奇異公司造成了一種龐大的X光放射機，呌做「被他脫籠」（Betatron）。這機器所發出的X光綫，十分强烈危險。爲安全計，在機器四週建了一座三呎厚的混凝土牆。戰爭期內，秘而不宣。直至去年十月中旬，當局方才約略透露了一些關於該機的大概。</p>
<p>「被他脫籠」是一具電子加速器，好像普通的交流電變壓器。二個一吋粗銅條做成的綫圈，圍繞着一百三十噸重的電磁鐵。大量電流通過時，呼呼作聲。</p>
<p>電磁鐵的兩極間，安置着一個直徑七十四吋的鐲形玻璃管眞空管，管內有一個熱燈絲，發出電子。電磁鐵二極間所形成的高度電力，使電子在管內循着正圓形軌道兜圈子。在二百四十分之一秒內轉二十五萬次，用電學度量計算，便是等於一萬萬伏特。</p>
<p>此後電磁圈內的電流逐漸減少，另有一個磁鐵將電子引出圓形軌道。電子就向內作螺旋形運行，而擊着一個　質的目標。X光綫便由此發出。</p>
<p>這X光可以照透厚鋼板，好像鋼是冰做成的一樣。它也會變別的戲法。譬如一個銀元被它稍微一照，就變成很危險的放射性物質。X光綫把銀原子內的中子擊出。一部份銀變成　，另一部份變成　。而銀元中的銅却又變成了　原子。</p>
<p>「被他脫籠」的控制器是裝在另一室內的。</p>

<p>在我們這一個道義之邦，八行書的效力較之長篇累牘的履歷是要硬起不知多少倍的。</p>
<p>並且，八行書不只影響着進門的一道難關，粗率地說，將影響到一直在這機關服務的終結。儘管考績，儘管考勤，背景硬的，終是處處占着絕對的優勢。</p>
<p>勝利到現在，已經五閱月了。勝利初期的容或有的不合理的現象，也應澈底加以檢討，採取『有則改之，無則加勉』的態度，使臻於盡善。而只憑八行書而作爲任用人員的標準的，也應努力考察一番了。</p>
<p>有八行書的平步登天，嘻嘻哈哈，沒有八行書的却只落得唉聲嘆氣自怨自艾。不論人才，只問八行書，世事的不公平，眞莫過於此了。</p>
<p>廢除八行書說情！制止以官爵作酬庸！有了考試制度不用，不太可惜麼。舉眼四矚，百廢待興，而極目四望，又人才蕭條，在這樣情形之下，再不澈底實施考試缺席，獎掖提拔人才，只憑八行書作爲準則，其對於復員工作的阻礙，不言可喻了。</p>

<h3>孩子的啟示</h3>
<p>— 張承浚</p>
<p>重病的叔父終於因身體衰弱，藥石無效，而於午後一時零五分逝世了。</p>
<p>我因一天工作疲勞，晚上探望了他老人家一面後，看他的神色似乎還不致於即刻就死，同時嬸母也勸我早些休息，免得明天辦公時毫無精神。於是我就返回自己房中去睡了。</p>
<p>午夜，時鐘打着沉重的一下，似乎是在發着催促我叔父動身離世的信號。他喉嚨間湧起了一口痰，塞住了他的咽喉。咯落一聲，終於悄悄離開了人世。</p>
<p>嬸母的哭聲驚醒了我。</p>
<p>叔父是殭直地躺在床上，再也不會睜開眼來一睹周圍的一切了，連他最親切的妻和超兒也在內。但超兒却被他的母親哭醒而跳了起來。</p>
<p>超兒今年才六歲，叔父最疼愛他，自從他「隔斷奶」後，總是和他爸爸睡在一起的，一晚也沒有離開過。自從二月前叔父病了，嬸母就把超兒遷移到另外一隻榻上睡覺。但是他常常哭嚷着要爸爸一同睡。</p>
<p>「爸爸正睡着。吵醒了他就要不喜歡你。」每當超兒吵鬧時，嬸母就會這樣哄騙他，他也似乎領悟這意思，爲要博得爸爸的歡喜，他就會馬上停止他的吵鬧</p>
<p>現在半夜三更，居然媽自己哭吵起來，在超兒目中認爲這不但妨礙他甜蜜的睡眠，而且是擾亂他親愛的爸爸底安眠的。</p>
<p>「媽媽，你常常呌我不要吵醒爸爸睡覺，現在爸爸睡得正熟的時候，你爲什麼要哭着吵鬧他，連我也被你吵醒呢？」超兒用着天眞的口吻，邊說邊注視着媽，滿以爲可以得到媽的稱讚我滿意的回答。</p>
<p>但事實恰是相反，嬸母連瞧他一眼都沒有，只是嗚咽着。</p>
<p>我在旁邊被超兒的表情弄得哭笑皆非，我得到了一個寳貴的啓示：「死簡直是長期的熟睡，有什麼稀罕和可哀？」</p>
<p>生與死雖然是兩個極端，但又靠得那樣近。人從幼年，童年，靑年，壯年到老年，以至於死，是那樣如朝露的那一瞬。如果像超兒那樣視父親的死爲熟睡，那我們對於死還有什麼恐怖和悲哀呢？</p>

<h3>Political Consultative Conference to Discuss Constitutional Draft Today; National Assembly Issue to be Handled by a Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference held its eighth meeting on the morning of the 18th at 9:00 AM. The agenda: (1) Continued discussion of the National Assembly issue, (2) Constitutional draft issue. However, due to the lengthy discussion of the National Assembly issue, the constitutional draft discussion was postponed to tomorrow. (Details of the eighth meeting and Mr. Chen Lifu's views on the National Assembly issue will be published in the third edition tomorrow.)</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The military subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th in the National Government's lounge. The government organization subcommittee held a meeting at 4:00 PM in the National Government's conference room.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The ninth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 19th to discuss the constitutional draft issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference held a meeting today and did not approve the planned convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year. It was referred to a subcommittee for handling. Zhou Enlai, the Chinese Communist Party representative, opposed the current organizational law of the National Assembly, stating that the Assembly was full of Kuomintang representatives.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] The Political Consultative Conference today held a heated debate on the validity and legality of the National Assembly representatives elected in 1937. It is expected that a compromise will be decided by a subcommittee to increase the number of representatives from various parties and factions. The final conference will be held tomorrow, at which time the draft constitution will be passed. The subcommittee will present a review report on the five major guidelines of the Political Consultative Conference, which is expected to be passed by the conference. Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai opposed the old representatives but said, "I do not wish to endanger national unity because of this." If the problem cannot be resolved, "I am willing to make considerable concessions." Luo Longji, representative of the Democratic League, proposed a voting method to decide whether National Assembly representatives need to be re-elected. He requested that the old candidates hold a general election and that the new constitution be subject to a referendum. Kuomintang representative Chen Lifu said that one-party rule officially began in 1924 and has now come to an end. He pointed out that the British Parliament continued to meet during the war and never stopped.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Chinese Communist Party today submitted a ten-point plan for Chinese constitutionalism to the Political Consultative Conference, advocating that all parties establish a national government of people's freedom and democracy under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and engage in agricultural, financial, educational, and industrial reforms. After the Kuomintang and the Communist Party disagreed on the issue of National Assembly representatives yesterday, the Consultative Conference began discussing the constitution. The central government intends to convene the National Assembly representatives elected ten years ago, while the Communist Party believes that new representatives should be elected, and then the Kuomintang's tutelage can end. The Communist Party's resolution on the constitution requires: (1) The speedy establishment of a constitutional government under Chairman Chiang, democratizing politics, nationalizing the military, and granting all parties equal legal status. (2) Guarantee of people's freedom. (3) Expansion of the government. (4) Election of new National Assembly representatives. (5) Local autonomous governments. (6) Reorganization of the National Military Council to unify military orders. (7) Immediate demobilization and reconstruction. (8) Financial and economic reform. (9) Cultural and educational reform to eliminate illiteracy. (10) Concluding treaties with various countries to promote international peace.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The members of the military inspection group to be selected by the National Political Council will continue to be nominated by the Standing Committee of the Political Council at the next regular meeting. As for the departure date, the members of the Political Consultative Conference and the members to be nominated by the Political Council are not all present, and it may still be necessary to wait for some time in Chongqing. As for the detailed inspection methods, no written notice has been formally received to date.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Mo Dehui arrived in Tianjin from Peiping at noon on the 18th, and after a brief delay, returned to Peiping to go to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>The Three Groups of the Mediation Department Depart to Work in Jining, Chifeng, and Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] (1) The Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department is scheduled to dispatch three peace groups today to Jining, Chifeng, and Jinan. According to news from the 12th War Zone, the Communist army continued to attack the county seat of Jining in eastern Suiyuan on the 15th. Communist personnel stated that General Du Yuming's troops continued to advance westward, and fierce fighting was underway near Chifeng. Therefore, the Executive Headquarters sent personnel to mediate. (2) The Executive Headquarters has held meetings for several days, but has not yet moved into the Union Medical College Hospital to officially work. The department is scheduled to host reporters at 4:00 PM on the 18th. (3) A group of staff members flew in from Zhangjiakou yesterday, but there is still a shortage of personnel, making it difficult to officially work immediately. (4) The Executive Headquarters has set up a news team. The American representative is Burton, the government representative is Ji Zejin, a section chief with extensive experience from the International Propaganda Department, and the Communist representative is Miss Peng, a diplomatic reporter from Xinhua Daily. She is usually active among foreign reporters in the International Propaganda Department in Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] Colonel Leake of the Jinan Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, Colonel Tu Shuwu, staff officer of the Military Affairs Department, and Ma Jinqiao, the Communist representative, along with twelve attendants, flew to Jinan from Peiping at 1:30 PM on the 18th. After getting off the plane, they went to the office location to start working immediately.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] According to a certain newspaper here, the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department issued a warning to the Communist army in Jining, eastern Suiyuan, stating that if they still do not obey orders, the headquarters will take "effective measures." The newspaper said that the Communist army attacked the west gate of the city seven times on the evening of the 16th of this month and the next morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th] American observers stationed in the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department took off by plane this morning to inspect various parts of China and correct troop movements that violate the ceasefire order. It is understood that the areas to be corrected today include a portion of the Gubeikou area along the Great Wall and the area around Zhangjiakou, a stronghold of the Communist army. The Military Mediation Department is dispatching a three-person team by train to Gubeikou to correct the situation of the positions along the Great Wall.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 18th] Personnel dispatched by the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department to issue ceasefire orders have encountered serious restrictions for the first time. These personnel are not allowed to go to the Northeast, and their scope of activities is also limited in Jehol. Colonel Dutilot of the U.S. Army and his team have gone to Chifeng. The second team was originally planned to be sent to Chengde, but it has now been abandoned, reportedly because the airport facilities there are poor and not suitable for U.S. transport planes to land.</p>
<p>The Northeast issue is obviously very complicated. Although the military cessation of hostilities order has been issued by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Yingkou was recently occupied by the Communist army again. This matter has become the focus of discussion at the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department. Since the nine eastern provinces are no longer within the scope, the extent of the Executive Headquarters' authority in Jehol is now facing a serious test. The department has dispatched a reconnaissance plane to Gubeikou to investigate. It is reported that there are still conflicts there, and the Executive Headquarters will send personnel to go there. Other mediation personnel have arrived in Jining, Suiyuan Province, and Jinan, Shandong Province. These personnel are equipped with radio equipment and have six or seven transport planes in preparation for their return to Peiping.</p>
<p>There are already eighty government representatives and nearly one hundred American representatives in the Military Mediation Department here. The Communist representatives have not yet arrived due to transportation difficulties. A group of Communist representatives arrived here from Zhangjiakou and Yan'an on two planes, but the total number of Communist representatives is still less than fifty.</p>
<h3>National Highway Conference Presided Over by Minister of Communications Yu Penfei</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The National Highway Conference was held in Nanjing today. Minister of Communications Yu Penfei and Vice Minister Xue Zhui will personally preside over it. It is reported that there are five central issues: (1) Establishing a national highway system, (2) Expediting the repair of highways in the recovered areas, (3) Reorganizing highway operations on all lines, (4) Cultivating management talents and establishing a new atmosphere, (5) Encouraging private operation and opening up restrictions on commercial vehicles to facilitate the flow of goods and normalize prices. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway has been repaired to Zhenjiang, and the entire line is expected to be open to traffic within a month.</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin to Go to Nanjing to Promote Reconstruction Work</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] In order to promote reconstruction work, strengthen preparations for the return to the capital, and quickly review all pending cases in the recovered areas, the Executive Yuan has appointed its Secretary-General Jiang Menglin to work in Nanjing on a permanent basis. Mr. Jiang will fly to Nanjing from Chongqing before the 25th of this month. According to political figures who have already come to Nanjing, after Mr. Jiang arrives in Nanjing, not only will the work of the various departments be easier to promote, but also the preparations for the return to the capital are expected to shorten the schedule by one or two months.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jingguo Flies from Peiping to Changchun; Our Security Forces Begin to Deploy in the Shenyang Area</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] Jiang Jingguo flew back to the old capital from Chongqing tonight. He is optimistic, and he has a good impression of Moscow. Beyond that, he refused to say anything. Tomorrow, Mayor Shen Yi will fly to Changchun to prepare for taking office. Chairman Gao Xibing, who has been in Peiping for two months, recently bought two famous paintings and is appreciating them alone in his hotel to relieve the melancholy and loneliness he brought back from the Yalu River. A few days ago, he was eager to go to Changchun but was dissuaded. Mayor Dong Wenqi of Shenyang fell ill in his hotel as soon as he took office. When the national army arrived in Shenyang, his illness suddenly disappeared. The chairmen of the three provinces of Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin are still waiting for orders in Changchun. Wu Huanzhang, Chairman of Xing'an, has not yet taken any steps to take over in Peiping. It does not seem to be unfolding at an alarming speed. The occupation of Yingkou by the Communist army seems to have some impact on the current situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 17th] According to relevant sources, the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from Changchun on the 20th, and our security forces have begun to deploy in the Shenyang area. Furthermore, Jiang Jingguo flew to Peiping from Chongqing tonight and is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Today, another fourteen planes brought a batch of airborne troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 17th] Shen Honglie flew from Peiping to Jinzhou previously and is stationed at the headquarters. In addition to summoning personnel from the central ministries and commissions in Jinzhou to handle the takeover work, he conducted a preliminary inspection of the takeover matters. In recent days, he inspected the former Dongmian Textile Factory and the former Manchurian Synthetic Fuel Factory in Jinzhou. In the afternoon of the 17th, he visited the city of Jinzhou, and in the afternoon, he went to Huludao to inspect the Jinxi Cement Plant and the Siping Fuel Plant, and other important factories such as the Jinxi Manufacturing Plant. He is scheduled to inspect the Huludao port and wharf on the 18th to prepare for future repairs. The opening of the port of Huludao was personally completed by Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department and the Chinese Embassy announced today that they have not been able to confirm reports from Jinzhou that the Soviet Union has requested the Chinese government to jointly manage commercial airports and heavy industry in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Financial Institutions Resume Operations One After Another; Harbin's Economic Situation is Prosperous; Counties in Songjiang Province Urgently Need Agricultural Implements and Cotton</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 18th] Since the provincial and municipal administrations were successively taken over here, the economic situation in the city has been improving, and the financial sector has been particularly active. During the puppet Manchukuo period, there were five government-run financial institutions and eleven private ones in Harbin. After August 15th, business was mostly disrupted due to the disorder of social order. After the entire municipal administration was taken over, in addition to the government-run puppet Central Bank being taken over and opened by the Central Bank, the Yifa, Gongcheng, Guomin, and Jewish banks among the private banks also resumed operations one after another. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern Bank also opened at the old site of the Yokohama Specie Bank. Due to the flexible financial sector and the improvement of public security, commerce and industry are gradually recovering. According to the manager of Yifa Bank, since the bank resumed operations on January 7th, it received more than ten million in deposits in just one week. Recently, the average daily deposits received have been over one million five hundred thousand, which is approximately equal to the amount of deposits received in one year during the puppet Manchukuo period. With the Lunar New Year approaching, goods and vehicles from the surrounding villages are streaming to the city, and all kinds of goods are on the market in a timely manner. The prosperity of commerce is no different from peacetime, and it is expected that there will be more rapid development after transportation is restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 16th] Since the Songjiang Provincial Government took over, representatives from various counties have come here to report on the local situation. The most urgent issues that all counties feel need to be resolved are spring plowing and cotton. In the past fourteen years, they have been unable to support themselves due to the ruthless exploitation by the Japanese. They feel particularly embarrassed after the recent turmoil. Moreover, iron agricultural implements were confiscated by the Japanese and no longer exist. Therefore, they earnestly hope that the authorities will provide agricultural implement loans, transport cotton, and distribute agricultural implements to farmers to facilitate cultivation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Siping, 16th] Yesterday, Jianzhong dispatched personnel to take over an oil and chemical plant here, renaming it the Liaobei Provincial Oil Refinery. The plant has not stopped working since August 15th. It currently only produces kerosene and can produce ten tons per day. According to the investigation, the raw materials for the plant can still be maintained until May of this year. Furthermore, the Siping Municipal Government also dispatched personnel on the same day to take over the "Toyo" and "Kangde" flour mills to prepare for resuming operations.</p>
<h3>After the Deadline for the Cessation of Hostilities Order, the Communist Army's Novel Strategies: "Troop Rotation," "Taking Over Defense," "Pleading for Mercy"</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The executive work of the Military Mediation Department can be described as heroic. Yesterday and today, naval planes carrying a large number of ceasefire orders were seen flying at low altitude over the Communist army positions in Guanzhou Zhaian and other places at great risk. It is not possible to predict what the reaction will be today. However, according to the engineering personnel who are rushing to repair the railway in the northern section of Jinpu, the Communist army's novel strategies after the announcement of the ceasefire agreement have confused and troubled the military and civilians in Shandong, making them both amused and annoyed. The actual situation is as follows: (1) "Troop Rotation": After the Communist army successfully ambushed the national army, they notified the national army, stating that they were ordered to take over the defense and asked them not to misunderstand. Now that there is a ceasefire, they will stop fighting from now on. The events of yesterday need not be taken into account. The reason for their announcement to the public is also "taking over defense." (2) "Taking Over Defense": After the Communist army successfully ambushed the national army and took over point A, the national army had to comply with the ceasefire order and withdraw to point B. The Communist army then took advantage of this and launched another attack. At this time, if the national army is slow and deliberate, reasoning with them and sending personnel to question the Communist army, the Communist army will also reply politely in a letter, explaining that they were actually ordered to take over the defense, and if they do not retreat, they will be responsible for the consequences. (3) "Pleading for Mercy": If the Communist army's ambush of the national army is unsuccessful and their reinforcements are not sufficient, they will be frustrated and ashamed, and they will shamelessly plead for mercy from the national army, claiming that they did not come to attack cities and seize land, but were forced to do so due to lack of food and clothing. They asked to borrow some clothes, food, and legal tender. This is the most inferior of the novel strategies.</p>
<h3>Our Materials Stored in India Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Successively</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 17th Special Dispatch] The committee for receiving our materials stored in India has begun working here. The first batch of materials, approximately six thousand tons, is expected to be fully loaded at the docks here in the middle of this month and shipped to Shanghai on two British freighters. It is hoped that more than two shipments can be made per month thereafter. Based on the current shipping situation, it is expected that all the materials can be shipped from India to Shanghai in approximately four months to half a year.</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Foreign Trade is Increasing Month by Month; Customs Duties Exceed 30 Million Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th] Since the resumption of international trade here, foreign goods have been pouring in and native goods have also returned to normal. Foreign trade is increasing, so customs duties are increasing daily. Huo Qiqian, Customs Commissioner of the Guangdong Customs, told reporters that the revenue in September of last year was approximately four million yuan, which increased to five million six hundred thousand yuan in October, then to thirteen million yuan in November, and exceeded thirty million yuan in December. This shows the active results of foreign trade after the liberation of Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Anhui Rice Prices Tend to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Yang Cuncun, a representative from the Grain Department of Southern Anhui, came to Nanjing and requested that the authorities reduce the original quota of three million piculs of military grain to be purchased in Anhui by one million piculs. This news has been passed on to Wuhu by the representatives, and the people of Anhui are greatly relieved. It is reported that rice prices in Wuhu and other places in Anhui are trending downward.</p>
<h3>Soviet Inspector Cheng Zhongxing Arrives in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuxi, 18th] Mr. Cheng Zhongxing, the Soviet Inspector, arrived in Wuxi at noon on the 18th. Mr. Cheng first inspected the factories and is scheduled to convene a meeting with responsible persons from party, government, and military agencies, as well as various industries, on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>China and Siam Negotiate a Treaty of Friendship; Negotiations Held on the Bangkok Massacre of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th Special Dispatch] It has been learned from reliable sources that the Siamese government has requested to exchange ambassadors with our country and that our country send five consuls to the current administrative area of Siam. Li Tiezheng has conveyed this to our government and is awaiting instructions. Sino-Siamese diplomatic negotiations have entered their third day today. The two countries have not yet discussed formal diplomatic issues such as the education of overseas Chinese children and our immigrants. Today, they began to raise heated discussions on both sides. The current negotiations will conclude a Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, which has not existed in the two countries for nearly two centuries. Although China and Siam have had friendly relations in the past, it is heard that the proposed treaty will be based on equality and reciprocity. It is heard that they have reached an agreement on its broad principles, and only some details remain to be discussed.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch, 15th] The Sino-Siamese negotiations, originally scheduled to continue today to resolve the Bangkok massacre of overseas Chinese, were postponed to tomorrow afternoon due to the indisposition of Siamese Interior Minister Banyakan. Negotiations to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries will be held separately. Our three representatives held talks with Siamese Police Chief Plaramin Indra for half an hour regarding the massacre. Mr. Pho expressed his regret for the unfortunate event and hoped that the peoples of China and Siam, who have a long-standing friendship, could live and work together in Siam in the future. It is learned that our delegation will propose the following conditions as the basis for resolving the atrocity: (1) Investigate the responsibility for the incident and punish the perpetrators. (2) Compensate our overseas Chinese for all losses. And (3) Guarantee that the same incident will not happen in the future.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Exposes Traitors, Hopes People Will Freely Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to sources in the judicial sector, the authorities have decided to transfer all traitor cases in Nanjing to Suzhou for trial. Sun Honglin, President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, and Han Tao, Chief Prosecutor, came to Nanjing from Suzhou yesterday to meet with Vice Minister Xie Yunzhou of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] The Taiwan Garrison Command has stipulated that a general report of traitors will be held throughout the province for one week starting today, hoping that the people of the province will report the crimes of traitors during the Japanese rule of Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Gunshot Wound Case in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily Office; Soldier Qin Yingjun Shot</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] At 12:30 PM on the 17th, Qin Yingjun, a major general staff officer from the former Kunming Garrison Headquarters and a native of Ziyang, Shandong, was talking with Zhang Ruxin, the business director of Xinhua Daily, in the business department. He then flipped through newspapers there. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and Qin immediately fell to the ground, and a Browning pistol was found on the ground. According to Zhang Ruxin, Qin committed suicide. He was shot in the left waist, and his injuries were serious, so he was escorted to the Municipal Hospital by the Fourth Police Sub-bureau for treatment. The cause of his injury, as well as the gun and the shell casing, are under investigation. According to Yin Jun of the Municipal Hospital, when Qin arrived at the hospital, he asked him why he was injured. Qin only said, "It's a long story, please give me a painkiller." Then, he fell into a coma.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Qin Yingjun, who was shot in the Xinhua Daily business department on the 17th, has been recovering well since being sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment, and the bullet in his abdomen has been removed. The cause of his injury is still under investigation.</p>

<h3>Holding Domestic and Foreign Exchange Services: Postal, Telegraph, and Transportation Departments Actively Preparing for Resumption</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] Exchange services between the nine northeastern provinces and the mainland will soon begin. The Economic Commission here will establish a special committee of seven members to manage this matter. The committee will be located in Changchun and, when necessary, will establish branches in major cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian. All exchanges from the nine northeastern provinces of circulating currency to legal tender, or from the mainland of legal tender to circulating currency, must first apply to the committee for approval. However, households remitting less than 5,000 yuan in circulating currency or its equivalent in legal tender per month do not need to apply. This exchange will be operated by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks; no other banks are allowed to operate it. The exchange rate will be posted daily by the Central Bank. Furthermore, since the banks here began exchanging legal tender at a rate of 13 to 1, very few people have come to exchange. This may indicate that there is not much legal tender flowing into this area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] Northeastern postal, telegraph, and transportation services are actively preparing for resumption. Although postal and telegraph functions in various places have been suspended for a long time, most employees are still holding fast to their posts, quietly awaiting central government takeover. Currently, transportation ministry telecommunications officials are studying pricing issues, and once these are settled, operations can begin. Furthermore, the takeover of railway transportation outside of the China Changchun Railway is still in the preparation stage, and the entire takeover may take a month.</p>
<h3>Serious Disaster Situation in Chao-Shan and Henan: Relief Administration Publishes Investigation Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] In October of last year, the United Nations Relief Administration dispatched inspectors Johnson, Moore, and Parnell to the Chao-Shan and Henan areas to inspect the disaster situation after being ravaged by the enemy's cavalry and to investigate the relief materials urgently needed in these areas. Johnson and others completed a detailed investigation of the disaster conditions in the aforementioned areas last month and have prepared a report for submission to the Administration, detailing the damage, disaster situation, and relief and reconstruction measures. Here is an excerpt of the original text:</p>
<p>The inspector to the Chao-Shan area was Johnson. Johnson departed from Guangdong on October 18th of last year and spent more than two weeks investigating. His report is 25 pages long. According to his report: "The total population of Chao-Shan (including Chaozhou and Shantou) in 1939 was 4,750,000. Since 1939, the population has greatly decreased. However, it is currently not easy to investigate the total population of the entire area. The reasons for the population decrease are as follows: entering the mainland, dying in air raids, Japanese atrocities, hurricanes, nutritional deficiencies, and diseases, and being plundered by the Japanese military. During the investigation, trial statistics of population changes and their causes were conducted in several places. The results showed that Shantou had 220,000 people before its fall (1939), and 150,000 people at the time of the investigation (November 1945). The current population of Shantou is 60,000 less than before its fall. Among them, 25,000 died from famine and disease, 5,000 were killed or plundered by the Japanese army, 1,000 died from air raids, and the remaining 29,000 could not be traced, presumably dying of starvation during their exile."</p>
<p>The report also stated: "The Chao-Shan area is currently in a difficult situation. The reasons for this are: (1) famine and Japanese looting; (2) naval blockade, no foreign rice coming in, and trade stagnation; (3) complete stagnation of the two major industries (weaving and fishing); (4) agricultural decline, loss of production, and lack of fertilizer; (5) financial chaos and cessation of overseas remittances; (6) the current political situation. Regarding relief, the area urgently needs rice, which is listed as the first item to be relieved. Clothing is second, followed by medicine and treatment. Housing is next, and finally, displaced people."</p>
<p>Regarding reconstruction issues, Johnson also detailed them: "It is found that there are a total of 400,000 people engaged in weaving in the Chao-Shan area. The raw materials come from overseas, and the finished products are exported to the United States and other places. When the war broke out, foreign transportation was interrupted, and this industry plummeted, losing all its capital. People in the industry are now requesting assistance with funds to restore their business, restore foreign shipping routes, and adjust foreign exchange. In addition, there are other handicrafts such as bamboo work and pottery. It is also found that the most important product of the Chao-Shan area is fishing. Because most of the fishing boats were lost, their situation is extremely difficult, but the assistance they need may be the easiest to give. What they need is wood for shipbuilding, tung oil and hemp for making steel cables, as well as iron, nails, and tools. Also, the area does not produce much rice, only enough to supply half of the people's food. During the war, farmers fled, and foreign raw materials were no longer transported in, resulting in even less production. What farmers urgently need now is artificial raw materials and soybean cake, with soybean cake being particularly welcome. The next is the replenishment of plowing cattle and farm tools, and the construction of embankments to prevent flooding is also an urgent task. All these requests have been translated and sent to the Guangzhou regional office of the Administration for verification. The buildings and public utilities that have been destroyed must wait until loans are obtained and cement and other materials are imported before reconstruction can begin. Detailed needs are currently being compiled. Regarding transportation, the importance of foreign shipping and inland river transportation is self-evident. A list of various ships that have been destroyed is also being compiled. There was originally a railway from Shantou to Chao'an, but the rails no longer exist, and the roadbed has become a car road."</p>
<p>Moore and Parnell, representing the United Nations, went to Henan Province, riding horses, taking sedan chairs, and traveling in slow-moving cars for more than 40,000 miles to investigate the war disaster situation in the province. According to their estimates, about two million people in Henan Province, accounting for one-sixth of the province's population, are now in a dire situation of becoming starving corpses and are in urgent need of relief. Moreover, many wear summer clothes in the cold winter, and these unfortunate people have no place to shelter from the cold. Due to the lack of food, clothing, and housing, infectious diseases are rampant throughout Henan Province. Western Henan has been through repeated wars and has been occupied by the enemy, so its situation is the worst. More than 200,000 poor people have taken refuge in other places, and recently, when they returned, they saw that their houses had either been burned or looted, and all their furniture had been destroyed by the Japanese. According to the two representatives: "Everywhere we went, we heard people say that from the time of Japan's defeat to the time we came to inspect in November, 80 to 90 percent of the people in western Henan were sick." In the worst-hit areas, the dead accounted for between 10 and 15 percent of the total population. The representatives of the United Nations Relief Administration also stated: "The most important need is agricultural reconstruction. The lack of livestock is the most serious single problem." Those who fled their homes to avoid the Japanese army's invasion of Henan Province in 1945, when they attempted to attack Xi'an, all said in unison: "There was no harvest of wheat last year, and no wheat was planted for the next crop." This kind of complaint is everywhere in western Henan. Because when the Japanese army invaded last year, the people of Henan did not have time to plant wheat and fled hastily, so there was no harvest when they returned home. The representatives of the United Nations Relief Administration also stated that the first township authorities initiated a self-help method that did not require outside assistance. Other counties also adopted it and achieved results. They said: "This method is to use the plowing cattle of neighboring areas that were not affected by the war and still have livestock to cultivate the fields in the recovered areas. This is purely based on the simple philosophy of those who have helping those who do not. More than 3,000 cattle are distributed in one county. On average, they work for about 20 days. The cattle owners come to work with their cattle and provide fodder. As for the food for the people, it is provided by the local relief committee. However, this system cannot be applied during the busy farming season in June, because it is necessary to harvest and thresh wheat, and planting must be done within a month."</p>
<p>Farmers need steel to make farming tools. It is believed that in some areas, with the availability of loans, it will be easier to equip tractors and other machinery. However, in completely destroyed areas, direct relief is needed. Other equipment needed includes new looms, which is a work-relief plan to replace the more than 100,000 handlooms destroyed by the Japanese army. In addition to the war, Henan Province also has the Yellow River disaster area, which started in 1932 when the levees were breached to stop the Japanese army's advance. This is a large-scale relief and reconstruction problem in Henan Province. It is estimated that the area flooded during the flood originally had a population of five million people. However, there are no accurate statistics on the number of refugees in the Yellow River disaster area. Roughly estimated, there are currently about two million people in the Yellow River disaster area, at least one million of whom are starving. The reconstruction plan for this area includes returning the Yellow River to its original course and building dikes along the river to reduce the flooded area and prevent good farmland from continuing to be flooded. The most severely affected areas of Henan Province have many Catholic churches. According to the priests, people are eating whatever they can find due to extreme famine, so food is the most important relief item needed, but relief in the form of clothing and medicine is also important.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces Abandonment of African Mandate Territories, Placing Them Under Trusteeship System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly that three British-mandated territories in Africa, namely Tanganyika, Upper Cameroon, and Togoland, would be placed under the trusteeship system. Transjordan will become an independent state. Any step taken by any country so far in the London Assembly is the most important and far-reaching. Following this, the Commissioner for South Africa explained last night that South West Africa, the former German colony currently under mandate to the Union of South Africa, must have its future decided after consulting the people of the area. Preliminary consultations have begun on the transfer of the three British-mandated territories in Africa to the Trusteeship Council. It is heard that the issue of Transjordan's full independence will be discussed when Emir Abdullah visits London next month. Thus, the only land still under direct British mandate is Palestine. According to Bevin's announcement, it is now necessary to wait for the results of the British-American investigation committee on Palestine before making any suggestions on the Holy Land. Bevin's words have attracted attention from all parties. It is generally believed that Transjordan and Palestine may unite and solve the Palestinian issue by means of division. Last night's opinions seemed to believe that Transjordan's independence would not make the division of the Palestinian issue more difficult to resolve. According to our correspondent, Jin Shu: There are several key points to consider in giving Transjordan independence. For example, Transjordan occupies a special position in the Middle East. Its army is crucial to ensuring its own security. Therefore, Transjordan's independence is closely linked to the future of its army. Therefore, when Abdullah comes to London, he may raise issues such as forming a joint defense force with Iraq. Note: Tanganyika was formerly German East Africa, later divided by Britain and Belgium, and transferred to British mandate in 1921. It has more than five million indigenous people and 16,000 Europeans, managed by a governor with two councils, executive and legislative. Cameroon is between Nigeria and French Equatorial Africa. It was seized from the Germans in 1916 and divided by Britain and France three years later. It was transferred to British mandate in 1922 and has a population of less than one million, jointly managed by the Governor of Nigeria. Togoland is between the Gold Coast colony and French Dahomey. In August 1914, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. The First World War was divided by Britain and France. The British-mandated area has a population of less than 500,000, jointly managed by the Governor of the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Palestine Not on the List of Abandonment</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced at the United Nations General Assembly today that Britain had decided to transfer three mandate territories in Africa to the United Nations for trusteeship, and Transjordan would eventually be granted independence. The whole audience applauded unanimously. However, most representatives of various countries had heard about it beforehand, so they were not surprised. However, Palestine is not on the list of British-mandated territories to be abandoned, apparently because the British-American investigation committee is inspecting the situation of Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Any announcement at this time would hinder the work of the committee. Palestine did not send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, so the representatives of the countries belonging to the Arab League expressed great concern about this and morally fully supported it. The demand of the Palestinian Arabs is that Palestine must become an independent Arab state, but the representatives also believe that the committee's investigation report should not be preconceived, so they will not decide on the final attitude until the report is published. According to Arab sources here: It is regrettable that the United States has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the Jews, but the conclusion of the committee may completely satisfy the Arabs. In any case, the Palestinian issue will not cause sharp conflicts during this session. If the committee's report is contrary to Arab opinions, the Arab League will convene a plenary session to decide on Arab policy and strategy.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Egyptian Foreign Minister Balinwi told United Press reporters today: According to the opinions of Arab nations, the British White Paper previously published has recognized Palestine as an Arab country, so there is no need to establish a British-American investigation committee for Palestine.</p>
<p>New Guinea: Australia Also Announces Abandonment</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] According to Melbourne Radio, Australian Prime Minister Chifley has announced that Australia will hand over the mandate territory of New Guinea to the United Nations for trusteeship.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 18th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley declared today that Australia is prepared to hand over New Guinea and the part of Nauru Island under Australian mandate to international trusteeship, because Australia has not dared to forget the obligations imposed by the United Nations Charter on member states in managing non-self-governing territories. The British and New Zealand governments, which jointly mandate Nauru, have agreed to Australia's decision. Note: Nauru Island and eastern New Guinea were formerly German colonies. After World War I, they were handed over to Australian mandate. Western New Guinea is a Dutch colony.</p>
<h3>Iran Consults the General Assembly on Procedures for Accusing the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The Iranian issue is still the biggest obstacle for the United Nations. If it is submitted to the Security Council for discussion, the unity of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be affected. If it is left unresolved, it will not be enough to calm Iran's anger and will damage the credibility of the entire Council. If the result of the vote is unfavorable to Iran, the smaller countries will lose faith in the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The chief representative of Iran to the United Nations General Assembly, 台, discussed the procedures for Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union with the Secretary-General of the General Assembly today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to London Radio on the 18th: The Iranian government's determination to submit the Iranian-Soviet dispute in Azerbaijan Province to the United Nations General Assembly has raised major procedural issues. This issue arose from the joint occupation of Iran by American, British, and Soviet troops. After the Soviet Union rejected the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee to investigate the situation in northern Iran, the British government "strongly advised" Iran not to submit the case to the United Nations General Assembly for adjudication. Later, the British government changed its policy and informed the Iranian government, "You are free to submit it to the United Nations General Assembly." The Iranian delegation has not yet decided whether to submit the case to the General Assembly or the Security Council, but it seems to be "inclining towards" the General Assembly. If submitted to the General Assembly, it may be handed over to the Political and Security Committee. If the case is handed over to the Security Council, there are signs that the debate will be postponed, because the Soviet Union can simultaneously raise other troublesome issues, such as the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, Indonesia, and other places.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressional Opinion</h3>
<p>Trusteeship of Pacific Islands to be Finally Decided by Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] President Truman announced a few days ago that the Pacific islands acquired by the United States from Japan would be transferred to the United Nations for trusteeship, but those with strategic value would still be kept solely by the United States. The congressional side expressed its opinion today, believing that Congress should make the final decision on which islands should be kept by the United States. Democratic Senator George and Republican Senator 　Kaisen said: They hope that the United States will not hastily determine this matter before Congress discusses it. This matter must first be approved by Congress before a decision is made. Those islands that need to be retained for strategic reasons should be handled according to the recommendations of the Army and Navy. For the sake of future security, these islands must be completely retained by the United States. The proposal to place all Pacific islands under trusteeship, with the United States as the sole trustee, cannot be agreed to.</p>
<h3>U.S., Britain, and Soviet Union Reach Agreement to Dispose of German Ships</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 18th] According to reliable sources here today, the naval committee of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has reached an agreement on the disposal of German warships, merchant ships, and other ship equipment. The contents of the agreement will be published simultaneously in Washington, Moscow, and London. It is reported that except for a few ships that will be used by the United States for testing, the other warships are not needed by various countries due to differences in structure and gun caliber.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Producers Compete to Film Atomic Bomb Movies; MGM is Already Filming</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hollywood, 17th] Some Hollywood film producers have encountered a problem. That is, how to link the issue of sex with the atomic bomb. Now there are four film companies competing to see who can be the first to complete a film about the atomic bomb and show it everywhere. According to Hollywood conventions, they all want to add some romance to the realism. Sam Marx is producing this film for MGM, believing that he has solved the problem. His film is called "The Beginning or the End," and the content is a humane story that depicts the daily life of atomic bomb workers and how tense it is. He is not allowed to talk to others about his work. There are thousands of laws for seven people to gather together, not only prohibiting drinking, but even those who play cards must be punished. Marx said: "People who work in atomic bomb factories, few people can understand what a tense matter their children are. They never know why they move frequently, or what their husbands do, or where they will move next time. Many marriages have therefore broken down. Now we see very clearly that the man lost the woman, and the world got the atomic bomb, so the man got the woman again." Marx traveled back from Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and learned about the significance of the atomic bomb from President Truman and other matters related to the atomic bomb program. Marx said: "The invention of the atomic bomb may not have been in 1945, but in 2045. I hope that Americans who watch this film will get some impression of the importance of the atomic bomb."</p>
<h3>United Nations Security Council Holds First Meeting: Gu Weijun Emphasizes Importance of the Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] The United Nations organization's eleven representatives held their first meeting this afternoon, marking the true existence of the powerful Security Council. This historic meeting took place in London's renowned Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. In these difficult times, the great task of maintaining world peace will rest on the shoulders of the representatives. The five permanent members of the Security Council—the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China—all have the right to veto any action of the Council. In addition, it includes non-permanent members Australia, Brazil, Egypt, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Poland. The Security Council's current priorities are: (1) the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization; (2) the first convocation of the Military Staff Committee meeting; and (3) discussing ways for member states to utilize the military forces of the Security Council. Australian Foreign Minister Makin delivered the opening address, stating, "I declare the Security Council officially established and in session." The Polish representative then presented to the Council the report of the preparatory committee of the Council. The United States chief representative Stettinius stated: The success of the Security Council depends on how member states fulfill their special responsibilities, especially the responsibility of coordination, before the Council can take effective action. This clearly refers to the veto power of the five powers. The Chinese chief representative Gu Weijun stated: This meeting is an event of great significance to peace-loving people in the world. China deeply loves peace but does not submit to others. The primary responsibility of the United Nations organization is to maintain peace and security, and China is immensely pleased with the establishment of this major organ of the United Nations. Bevin, after praising the United Nations organization and the Security Council as "a great success," emphasized the importance of the International Secretariat. He believes that the money spent on the United Nations organization to make it effective is insignificant compared to the vast expense of war. He continued: The current great gathering of nations is the realization of the hope held during the darkest days of the war, its purpose being to create a world organization so that mankind can live in freedom and peace without fear. The responsibility of the United Nations organization is to regard war as illegal and to take immediate action if there are any signs. It is the responsibility of the Security Council to carefully plan to prevent any aggressor from launching another war. We also welcome the Atomic Energy Commission, which controls scientific inventions. According to information from the Dutch delegation here, to date, the Chairman of the unrecognized Republic of Indonesia, Sjahrir, has not yet appealed to the United Nations organization on behalf of the government of the Republic. A member of the Dutch delegation told the United Press that although such news has been circulating from the Indonesian side, no such request has been received to date. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk, following Bevin's speech, suggested that the world's arms industry should be controlled by the United Nations organization and urged the establishment of regional centers of the United Nations organization to deal with issues such as health and agriculture. Masaryk also suggested that trade unions should be able to send representatives to the United Nations organization, especially the Economic and Social Council, so that organized labor in the world can have a voice in the United Nations organization. Currently, the World Federation of Trade Unions, with the support of the Soviet Union, is demanding this right to speak.</p>
<h3>Churchill Invited to Visit the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Miami, 17th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill, at the age of 71, made a long journey, crossing the Atlantic from Britain to New York, and then from New York to southern Florida, a total of 4,500 miles. Today, after examination by cardiologist Dr. Harris, it was announced that Churchill's health is good and has not been affected by the long journey. People generally expected Churchill to attend the opening ceremony of the Hialeah Racetrack, but it is understood that Churchill does not intend to appear in public immediately, so this hope has now vanished. Before dinner yesterday, Churchill took a leisurely drive with his host, Colonel Clark, around the palm-lined canals and Miami Beach for about an hour. He appeared very relaxed and in high spirits.</p>
<h3>Chilean Literary Figure Wins Nobel Prize</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] The Chilean literary figure, Mistral, has won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Director of Cultural Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry, Raoul, hosted a banquet today to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Speech by Soviet Representative to the UN General Assembly, Gromyko</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The acting head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations organization, Gromyko, addressed the General Assembly meeting this morning, stating in brief: The first session of the United Nations organization's General Assembly is an important stage in the process of freedom-loving nations striving for peace and security. It is also the inevitable development of the ideas expressed in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Declaration at the Moscow Conference in October 1943. The declaration stated that an international organization must be established to ensure peace and security.</p>
<p>Gromyko continued: All countries, large and small, are concerned with obtaining a stable peace and preventing the recurrence of aggression. Now, an organization responsible for maintaining peace has been established, and if aggressors attempt to endanger peace and freedom, the Security Council can stop them. The most important principle of the Charter has therefore been implemented.</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation hopes that the activities of the Security Council will be aimed at realizing the objectives of the United Nations organization and will be effective from the beginning. It is also hoped that the General Assembly will establish an Atomic Energy Commission, as proposed at the last Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, as soon as the organization is established, it is heard from some quarters that the Charter is outdated and needs to be revised. All those who wish to establish a strong organization to ensure security must strongly refute these arguments, as they are dangerous and can have serious consequences.</p>
<p>For the activities of the various organizations of the United Nations to be fruitful, compliance with the Charter is a necessary condition, and the United Nations organization must be different from the League of Nations. If the methods used by the League of Nations are repeated, it will be harmful to the United Nations organization. Some provisions in the Charter have not yet been implemented, especially the one concerning non-self-governing territories.</p>
<p>The trusteeship system is a tool intended to accelerate the granting of independence to these peoples. Therefore, the prompt implementation of the trusteeship system is one of the most important obligations of member states. The preparatory committee has made considerable progress and has already passed a special resolution requesting that certain member states of the United Nations organization convert one of these types of territories into a trust territory.</p>
<p>Gromyko also stated: The United Nations organization was created as a result of the bloody battle against fascism. Now, German fascism and Japanese militarism have been defeated, and the two sources of aggression that have alarmed the world for many years and plunged humanity into the most brutal war have been eliminated. However, it would be a mistake to believe that this military victory means that there is no need to continue efforts to completely eliminate the remnants of fascism. The struggle to eliminate the remnants of fascism is inseparable from the work of the organization.</p>
<p>Gromyko concluded: "Please allow me to express the hope for the success of the conference's work. The Soviet delegation will do its best to contribute to the successful completion of the conference."</p>
<h3>MacArthur Arrests More Japanese War Criminals: Total of 110, Including Lianjie Guji: Headquarters Allows Japanese to Choose Their Own Political Parties and Leaders</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to arrest 110 more war suspects, including seven generals and many administrators from various parts of Asia. Former head of the general headquarters, Kazuo Washi, is listed first. The second is former Hong Kong Governor, Lieutenant General Guji Kangjie; former commander of the Japanese army on Davao Island in the Philippines, Lieutenant General Kawatani; former commander of the 25th Army, Lieutenant General Sakai; former commander of the 6th Division, Lieutenant General Tani; former commander of the 38th Division, Lieutenant General Kakezu; former commander of the 3rd Wartime Transportation Unit in Singapore, Major General Watanabe; and captain of the prisoner ship "Tachibana" Maru, Yasuda. More than 70 of the new suspects are responsible for prisoner camps, including supervisors of the famous Cabanatuan prisoner camp in the Philippines and the prisoner camp in Shenyang.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Tokyo, 17th] Crane of the "New York Times" reported from Tokyo that after "a rather neat about-face," the Communist Party of Japan has proposed depriving the Emperor of his political power but retaining him as a "formal leader" pending a nationwide vote to decide his future. This clever political action followed the return of Japanese Communist leader Susumu Okano. Okano, who changed his name several times during 16 years of exile, had recently resided in Yan'an, the Communist Party's stronghold, and for the past two years, his consistent position had been to abolish the Emperor. However, Okano has now realized the truth. Upon returning to the country, he immediately urged the Communist Party of Japan to change its course because following the original path was tantamount to political suicide. No matter how well the Japanese can accept the ideas of liberalism, they still regard the Emperor as the head of state. Therefore, the Communist Party's demand to abolish the Emperor has not been warmly welcomed. However, after the Communist Party changed its policy, the situation has obviously changed. The Communist Party had discussed with the Socialist Party of Japan to form a "People's Front," and now they have some hope. At least 29 leaders of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Japan have agreed to join this "People's Front." The Communist Party of Japan has greatly increased its strength through this transformation. To counter this, 14 right-wing political parties in Japan have announced that they will form a united front. However, their strength is obviously not comparable to the "People's Front" that is about to be established.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Allowed to Carry Handguns</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] It was announced today that MacArthur's headquarters has allowed the Japanese government to equip Japanese police with handguns. MacArthur's instructions stated that the Japanese side's prohibition of police carrying weapons was a misunderstanding of MacArthur's disarmament instructions. Previous instructions had never prohibited the police from carrying handguns. "MacArthur's headquarters has never had this intention." The Japanese side stated that the police's lack of weapons would hinder the maintenance of order and the suppression of crime. However, although the police may carry handguns when performing their duties, the total number of handguns issued must not exceed the number of police personnel approved by MacArthur's headquarters, and each handgun may be loaded with 100 rounds of ammunition. All other military supplies and excess handguns must be in accordance with the approved strength of the Japanese police. According to MacArthur, the total number of Japanese police officers approved is 93,935.</p>
<h3>Australia and New Zealand Submit List of War Criminals, Including Hirohito</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The governments of Australia and New Zealand have submitted a list of war criminals, including Emperor Hirohito, which has caused considerable difficulty for the Allied headquarters. The headquarters' intention is not to include the Emperor in the list of war criminals. The list submitted by the United Kingdom did not include the Emperor as a war criminal.</p>
<h3>Japan to Organize Royalist Party</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] According to the Jiji News Agency, Japan will soon organize a royalist party to teach the people about the Emperor system. It will be supported by secondary figures in the business community. The party will also propose moving the imperial palace to the ancient city of Kyoto, so that the Emperor will be in a detached position from politics.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] Kyodo News Agency reported: Constitution Research Committee member Shiratsuki presented a chapter on the constitution to Emperor Hirohito today, advocating the establishment of a regency in accordance with the imperial palace laws.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Tells Senate that Reducing U.S. Troops in the Pacific Will Weaken Control</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower conveyed MacArthur's report to the Senate Military Committee today, stating that if the U.S. troops stationed in the Pacific are reduced to less than 400,000 by July 1, the military control over Japan and South Korea will be "weakened to a dangerous level." The troops stationed in the Pacific will be reduced to 375,000 workers by July 1, which is 25,000 workers less than MacArthur needs. How should this be remedied? Eisenhower replied: What I adjusted was the total number of air forces, while what MacArthur said included all troops stationed in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, the Mariana Islands, and Hawaii.</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky's Whereabouts Still Unclear: Soviet Representative Attends General Assembly: French Foreign Minister Arrives in London from Paris: Drafting of Peace Treaty May Begin Immediately</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 18th, midnight broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly convened an extraordinary meeting at nine o'clock this morning. Soviet Chief Representative and Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky arrived here by plane this afternoon to attend the meeting. Also arriving with Vyshinsky was a French representative. Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech on behalf of Vyshinsky at the General Assembly today, which was quite concise and pertinent.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Gromyko delivered the speech this morning on behalf of Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky. It is expected that Vyshinsky will not be able to arrive in London today. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Bidault and Undersecretary Thormeville are scheduled to return here from Paris today, and the deputy foreign ministers of the four countries concerned with drafting the peace treaty with European enemies may begin work immediately. Before Vyshinsky arrives in London, it is difficult to say whether they can go further in planning to start work. However, since the French government has now accepted the agreements recently negotiated in Moscow, there are no more obstacles to the four deputy ministers proceeding with their work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The whereabouts of Soviet Chief Representative to the United Nations organization, Vyshinsky, are still unknown. As it stands, Vyshinsky does not seem to have left Moscow yet. The most recent expectation is that he will arrive here on Saturday. According to reports, Vyshinsky is the Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. His position in the General Assembly is temporarily filled by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko. To date, the Iranian issue and the territorial demands on Turkey are still outside the debate of the General Assembly. The Executive Secretary of the United Nations organization, Jebb, has not yet received a request from the Iranian delegation to raise the Azerbaijan issue in the General Assembly or the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Withdrawing from Vietnam: Have Already Withdrawn from Hue and Tourane</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] A diplomatic source told the United Press today that the French Governor-General of Vietnam, Admiral D'Argenlieu, reported to Paris that Chinese troops have withdrawn from the cities of Hue and Tourane in Annam Province. He said: This is the first sign of the withdrawal of the Chinese Liberation Army from Vietnam. According to reliable sources: U.S. Commander in China Theater, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, recently urged Chairman Chiang to order the Chinese generals stationed in Vietnam to begin withdrawing troops. The French, seeing that most of the Chinese soldiers are from Yunnan, are quite worried that they will be unwilling to withdraw.</p>
<h3>Sound Wave Gun: Using Sound Waves to Kill: The United States is Investigating</h3>
<p>[United Press, Maryland, 18th] American Army ballistics experts announced today that the German army experimented with a new weapon before the end of the war, called the sound wave gun, which can kill people in 30 to 40 seconds using sound waves. After the war, Germany told American experts that they did not believe the weapon could succeed, but American officers said that it was possible and should be investigated further.</p>
<h3>The United States Compiles Atomic Fleet: Testing the Power of Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tulsa, USA, 18th] Rear Admiral Burke announced today: Testing the power of atomic bombs on warships this spring is estimated to cost 100 million yuan. It is expected that the results of this test will determine the future scale of the world's naval equipment test. The scale will be similar to the capture of Okinawa. According to scientists' speculation: if an atomic bomb explodes one and a half miles below the surface of the sea, it can exert the highest power.</p>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 18th] Workers heard today that a small team of "atomic fleet" was placed inside Pearl Harbor to test the power of atomic bombs. The Naval Staff did not confirm this news, but did not deny it. According to reliable sources: the naval authorities recently dragged many long-fought residual destroyers into Pearl Harbor for testing. The testing period may be this spring. At that time, battleships, cruisers and other ships will also gather to form an "atomic fleet."</p>

<p>Baocheng: Yangxing Puppet Town Mayor Wang Yihui Arrested and Prosecuted: Wang Yihui, former puppet town mayor of Yangxing, worked hard to get the current position after the victory. He used his position to extort money. The new county magistrate has investigated the matter and ordered his arrest.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Uncoordinated Coupling of Freight Cars: At 6:48 yesterday morning, a train of freight cars numbered 5th, originating from Shanghai, carrying over twenty cars, one of which carried military supplies weighing fifteen tons and three of which held a company of soldiers from the Guard Brigade under the command of the Liaison, headed by Company Commander Zhu Jie. The military supplies were to be unloaded here and at 7:30, the engine pulled the first ten cars forward to a platform, detaching car number 102 containing military supplies and shunting it into another rail for unloading. It was then returned to the original track to couple with the rest of the cars, but the engine was going too fast, and when the two cars collided, the hooks did not catch and the cars behind were jolted, causing them to roll backwards for dozens of feet. Ordnance was thrown from the cars, fortunately without exploding. Zheng Xianchi, the company aide, as well as soldiers Lu Dingyuan and Ye Teyu, who were standing near the door of the last car, were jolted and fell off into the rail. Lu Dingyuan had his right hand and foot run over, while Ye Teyu and Zheng Xianchi suffered injuries to the hand and ear. They were taken to hospital. Besides the seriously injured Lu, the others were luckily not in great danger.</p>

<p>Nantong: Traitorous Bandits Sabotage Reconstruction: The eastern Jinsha Town of this county has been heavily plundered and bandits set up agencies, indiscriminately issuing Resistance Currency to acquire supplies since it was occupied by traitorous bandits. Lately, when they heard that a large batch of national troops arrived in Nantong, the traitors intensified their efforts, ordering the local militia to demolish the east and west Yang bridges, and blocking passenger ships and boats on the Jin-Tong waterway. Their intention is obviously to sabotage reconstruction work and the people hate them bitterly.</p>

<p>Panorama of the Consultative Conference</p>
<h3>The First Milestone in the History of Peaceful Nation Building: The Political Consultative Conference in Pictures</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>The "New York Times" spoke with extreme sincerity in its editorial on the 7th, pointing out the main point: that everyone in our country has clearly recognized that unity and peace are the foundation for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and they are willing to build this foundation on the Political Consultative Conference, which began on the 10th. On the eve of the convening of the Consultative Conference, we strongly harbored an overwhelming wish - a wish placed on the meeting of the Three-Person Committee composed of Generals Ma, Zhang, and Zhou. This meeting began at 10:00 AM on the 7th in Yi Garden. After the talks, the two representatives of the government and the Communist Party (Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai) took a photo of special value with General Marshall. (See Picture 3) General Marshall, in this case, served as the chairman of the committee and completed the great and arduous task of mediator.</p>
<p>The achievements of the Three-Person Committee were great, laying the initial foundation for stopping military conflicts on the one hand, and solving the prerequisite problem of restoring national transportation on the other.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the same day that the Marshall-Zhang Qun-Zhou Enlai Three-Person Committee was meeting, an informal meeting of the Consultative Conference was also held under the chairmanship of Chairman Chiang, which included 38 representatives from nine parties and several non-party members. The agenda and voting methods of the first plenary session of the Consultative Conference, which was scheduled to open on the 10th, were discussed, and the meeting proceeded and ended in an extremely harmonious atmosphere. The seven representatives of the Communist Party were: Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Ye Jianying, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, and Wang Ruofei. A photo of them together is published here (see Picture 4). What is most interesting is that Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao are a loving couple, accounting for two-sevenths of all the representatives, which is truly rare.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the Democratic National Construction Association hosted the representatives of the Consultative Conference, and Peng Yihu delivered a speech, the enthusiastic mood of which can be seen in Picture 5.</p>
<p>The historically significant Consultative Conference was finally born on the 10th. This sweet baby was born after months of suffering and contention, so when its birthday arrived, all the military and civilians felt joyful. From the second picture, we see the solemnity and harmony of the opening ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government. The first picture gives us a hint of the orderliness and enthusiasm with which representatives from all parties, factions, and non-party members attended the meeting on time. Finally, the corner of the fifth picture shows the posture of Zeng Qi, the representative of the Youth Party, delivering a speech.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Lin Reports to the Consultative Conference on Military Reorganization Measures</h3>
<p>The full text of the report on military reorganization measures made by Lin Wei, Vice Minister of Military Affairs, when he attended the Political Consultative Conference on the 16th, is divided into two stages: The first stage described the military reorganization situation last year, which has already been seen on the first page of this newspaper on the 17th. According to a letter from the Central News Agency, "In the article on military reorganization measures reported by Vice Minister Lin Wei, which was issued by our agency yesterday, there are some errors in the numbers. The corrections are as follows: 'First, the reason for the military reorganization... the total number of troops is 49 armies, 128 divisions,' '128 divisions' should be changed to '182 divisions,'... expanding to 124 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, 112 regiments, and 15 battalions,' omitting '112 regiments.'... This expansion rate is only about two times,' 'two times' should be changed to 'one time.'" The second stage clarifies this year's military reorganization plan, which is moved and published here from Section (4). Readers are requested to pay attention. (Editor)</p>
<p>Any unit that has completed the reorganization in accordance with the principles of reorganization can begin to receive the new allowance; troops that have not been reorganized in accordance with the principles will still receive the old allowance. For example, a unit that completes reorganization first will enjoy the new allowance first. As of the end of the 34th year [1945], the situation of troop reorganization is as follows: (1) At the end of the 33rd year [1944], there were 124 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, 112 regiments, and 15 battalions. (2) Reduced in the 36th year [1947] 111 divisions, 21 brigades, 83 regiments, and 10 battalions.</p>
<p>(3) 87 armies, 235 divisions, 8 brigades, 35 regiments, and 5 battalions have been reorganized. (4) Those that have not been reorganized include 4 armies and 18 divisions, mostly in Xinjiang, where it is not easy to implement. (5) There are currently 89 infantry armies, 2 cavalry armies, and 253 divisions. (Including the newly added Youth Army 3 armies, 8 divisions and newly reorganized 2 divisions) Regarding the replenishment aspect, at the beginning of the plan, it was completely based on the counter-offensive plan, replenishing the combat power of the main counter-offensive forces, measuring the domestic ordnance production and foreign material assistance situation, so the troops under the jurisdiction of the Army Headquarters (ie, Alpha troops) and the southwest area troops were first replenished. The replenishment situation is as follows: (1) It is planned to equip 12 armies and 36 divisions with American equipment, and 10 armies and 31 division regiments with national equipment. By the end of the 34th year [1945], American equipment completed 80% of light weapons and 55% of heavy weapons. National equipment completed the equipment of 10 armies and 31 divisions, and other reorganized troops also have plans to gradually replenish. (2) Improving the lives of officers and soldiers. During the War of Resistance last year, prices rose sharply, and both production and transportation were extremely difficult. The lives of officers and soldiers across the country were in a very difficult state. The headquarters exhausted the central government's financial resources to improve the two major aspects of life's difficulties, namely, raising treatment and supplementing food. Regarding the increase in the treatment of officers and soldiers, from April to November of the 34th year [1945], there have been three adjustments, with officers' salaries increasing by 6 to 7 times and soldiers increasing by about 30 times. However, due to the limitations of national financial and material resources and the excessive increase in prices, it has not been possible to achieve the ideal stage. Secondly, supplementing food, that is, quantitatively issuing real goods, is an extremely urgent need to increase the nutrition of soldiers and officers. The headquarters made the greatest determination to achieve this goal. Although there is a standard for non-staple food expenses, those with excessively high prices in various places are also given an appropriate increase. Since the implementation, the nutrition of soldiers has improved a lot, but the situation in various places and transportation relations have not been fully implemented, which is a pity. (3) Adjusting the military organization, the size of military organizations and military schools is 4,300 units, 1,504 of which have been cut, and there are currently about 2,796, about 40% of which have been cut. There were originally 92 military schools, 49 of which have been cut, and there are now 43, about half of which have been cut or more. As a result of the reorganization, a total of 1.1 million personnel were cut. (4) The resettlement of surplus officers and soldiers. After the troops were cut and reorganized, the resettlement of personnel was an urgent matter. Detailed methods were formulated to ensure that surplus personnel were placed in the right positions. For surplus officers, the first step was to establish officer corps to collect them by region. A total of 14 officer corps, 4 brigades, and 4 companies were established, collecting a total of more than 37,000 people. It is also stipulated that all newly established institutions or other personnel to be supplemented should be transferred from the officer corps as soon as possible. The second time, professional training is given according to their performance and wishes. This year, the transfer is currently stipulated that the Central Training Corps is the general institution for transfer training, entrusting relevant departments to set up various specialized technical training classes for practical training.</p>
<h3>This Year's Military Reorganization Plan</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance has ended, this year is the stage of demobilization. The maintenance of the national army's military strength should be based on the principle of national defense and measure the country's economic strength, reducing it to the smallest possible elite troops. Therefore, a program was formulated to determine the goal of reducing it to 90 divisions within half a year, which is equal to one-half of the military strength in the early stage of the War of Resistance (26th year [1937]) and one-quarter of the military strength at the end of the War of Resistance (the end of the 33rd year [1944]). The main points are described as follows: (1) The current national army has 89 infantry armies, 240 divisions (including 3 divisions of the Eighteenth Group Army), 2 cavalry armies, and 13 divisions, totaling approximately 3.8 million people. It is planned to reorganize them into 90 divisions and 10 cavalry brigades, and retain approximately 1.8 million officers and soldiers, including special forces and service troops.</p>
<h3>The Entire National Army is Reorganized into 90 Divisions</h3>
<p>(2) The reorganization period is divided into two phases, each phase lasting three months. The first phase reorganizes 44 armies, and the second phase reorganizes 45 armies. It is expected that the reorganization will be completed within half a year. The cavalry will not be reorganized in phases, and it is expected that all will be completed before June. (3) Each army will first reduce itself by one-third, that is, an army with three divisions and nine regiments will be reorganized into an army with three divisions and six regiments, and an army with two divisions and six regiments will be reorganized into an army with two divisions and four regiments, and then reorganized into 90 divisions according to the organization. The army headquarters that should be established after the reorganization will be formed by the headquarters of each group army. (4) Each independent division, brigade, and regiment will be merged into the army for reorganization. (5) The surplus special forces of each army and division after the reorganization may be allowed to retain and appropriately compile them into independent regiments under the direct jurisdiction of the Military Commission. (6) The puppet army and advancing guerrilla units that were compiled and dispatched last August must be compiled and abandoned within four months. (7) After each army and division has been compiled and reorganized in accordance with the prescribed organization, the treatment of officers and soldiers may be improved, hoping to achieve the goal of consistent treatment between military and civilians.</p>
<h3>The Resettlement of Surplus Officers and Soldiers, Specific Measures are Formulated</h3>
<p>The resettlement of surplus officers and soldiers will continue the plan of the previous year and formulate specific measures as follows: (1) Approximately 1 million people are scheduled to be transferred from the group army (including 100,000 officers) and assigned to transportation, water conservancy, land reclamation, factories, local service teams, and other various traffic guards. (2) 200,000 people will be transferred individually (limited to military officers and subordinates). It is planned that after training, they will be assigned to administration, transportation, education, police, and other various national undertakings. (3) 500,000 people are scheduled to be dismissed and retired. All those who are old and weak and voluntarily return to their hometowns will be dismissed and retired in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Handling of Guerrilla Units and Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>The compilation and merger of guerrilla units, advancing units, and local teams, etc., the principles of compilation and merger: (1) Those belonging to local teams should still be returned to the local government for proper placement. (2) Guerrilla advancing units, etc., should be gradually compiled and merged into the army and division in accordance with the national army's compilation and reorganization of guerrilla units, and then abolished. (3) All surplus officers with formal qualifications will be recruited and trained for unified placement. During the recruitment and training period, they will be treated in accordance with 80% of the new salary. Compilation and merger process: (1) There were originally 160 guerrilla units, 38 detachments, and 203 battalions, with a total of 720,271 officers and soldiers and 144,680 guns. (2) As of the end of the 34th year [1945], except for the five columns of the Twelfth War Zone that have not yet been reorganized, the rest have been mostly transferred to regular troops, and a part has been reorganized into 18 security regiments, 22 replenishment regiments, and 4 guardianship regiments, totaling 101,000 people. The principle of management of the puppet army, the central government has decided to take compilation and dispatch as the basic principle for the handling of the puppet army. As for the officers, they are divided into four types: willingly surrendering, opportunistic, forced to be coerced, and sent to instigate rebellion, and they are handled separately according to the principal and subordinate. Regarding the handling situation, according to the reports of the Army Headquarters and various war zones, there are a total of 51 puppet army units (excluding the Northeast), with approximately 600,000 people. Since the national army entered the recovered area, except for the 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th war zones and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th armies south of the Yangtze River, the order has been generally established, and all puppet troops have been compiled and dispatched in accordance with the plan, totaling more than 200,000 people. As for the areas north of the Yangtze River, such as the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 11th, and 12th war zones, approximately 400,000 people, except for those who have been compiled and dispatched, there are approximately 200,000 people whose circumstances have not yet been able to be compiled and dispatched as expected. The headquarters stipulates that it must be completed within four months. The above is a brief description of the headquarters' plan for military reorganization and the implementation process since the beginning of last year. The headquarters has conducted a self-examination and is well aware that there are many shortcomings and that it is far from the goal of building an army. From now on, we can only work hard to study and improve on the one hand, and strive to implement it on the other, in order to achieve the policies determined by the central government and complete the initial great cause of army building, in order to live up to the expectations of Chairman Chiang and the people of the whole country. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Delivers a Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Consultative Conference</p>
<h3>China's First Cardinal, Tian Gengxin, Came from Humble Origins</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Newspaper Translation Department from the Great American Evening News</p>
<p>Recently, the Roman Pontiff (commonly known as the Pope), Pius XII, elected Bishop Tian Gengxin as a Cardinal of the Roman Curia. Bishop Tian is the first Chinese person to be elected to this important position in the Vatican, which is a pioneering event in Chinese history.</p>
<h3>Turmoil in Europe, Tian is Promoted to Bishop</h3>
<p>Bishop Tian was promoted to the position of bishop in Rome in October 1939, during the Christian festival. At that time, the flames of war were spreading across the European continent, and large numbers of troops were being dispatched. It was an extraordinary period of great turmoil. However, in Rome, Bishop Tian and eleven other newly ordained bishops of different nationalities quietly prostrated themselves at the steps of the altar, respectfully listening to Pope Pius XII recite a document praying for world peace and universal harmony. After that, Bishop Tian packed his bags and prepared to return to his motherland to carry out his sacred mission.</p>
<h3>One Horse-Drawn Carriage Passes Through a Dangerous Zone</h3>
<p>First, Bishop Tian went from China to Rome, and had experienced many hardships. He started from the interior of China, took a horse-drawn carriage, passed through the dangerous fire line, traveled more than 200 miles, and finally took a train to Shanghai, completing the first leg of his journey. From there, he transferred to the "Xianghuosi" ship, took the route through Hong Kong, Manila, and set off for Suez. When he was on the turbulent ocean, the flames of war in Europe had become irreversible. The ship had to sail to Kobe. Bishop Tian returned to Shanghai from there and boarded the "Chai'er" to Naples.</p>
<h3>Rags to Riches, with Profound Family Learning</h3>
<p>Bishop Tian came from humble origins, and few cardinals have come from more humble beginnings than him. His family has lived in a small village in Shandong - Zhangqiu - for generations. His father received a good education, was proficient in Chinese classics, and obtained a degree. He lived a teacher's life for nearly 25 years. In 1892, he worked as a professor of Chinese literature at a Catholic seminary. In 1898, he was baptized as a Catholic, and died the following year. In 1915, the bishop's mother was also baptized and died in 1922.</p>
<p>Bishop Tian was born on October 24, 1890, and lived with his parents in a village in Yanggu County. At the age of ten, he was sent to a church school in Boli (transliteration) to study Chinese classics and study doctrine. He was baptized in 1900, and in August 1904, he entered the Boli Junior Seminary to study. On June 9, 1918, he took the position of priest and began to carry out his sacred duties in Shanxian, Shandong. For the next two years, he studied and practiced in the Divine Word Society, and then returned there to resume his actual church work. In 1932, he was assigned as the acting pastor of Boxing County. On February 24, 1934, he was appointed as the papal envoy. In July 1939, he was elected as the papal envoy pastor of Yangxin County. In October of the same year, he was personally ordained as a bishop by Pope Pius XII. Fortunately, Bishop Tian's cross was personally awarded by the Pope, and it contained a valuable relic of the Holy Cross.</p>
<p>A church member who had known Bishop Tian for more than 20 years said that he was the first and always a "shepherd of the Holy Spirit." From the beginning, he was an exemplary pastor, and his tireless enthusiasm and steadfast piety made him rise to his current honorary position.</p>
<p>Bishop Tian is not only loyal to the missionary cause, but also attaches great importance to education. He recently planned to establish a middle school in Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Studying Scriptures and Performing Sacred Work</h3>
<p>Bishop Tian is kind and approachable in his dealings with people, and his demeanor is dignified. He is deeply respected by the church members of the continent and people from all walks of life. In addition to his native language, he is also proficient in English and German, and can be said to be a rare talent with both good character and learning. However, Bishop Tian has always been humble and never conceited. Perhaps Bishop Tian will feel flattered by his honor as China's first cardinal this time.</p>
<p>Catholicism has been introduced into China since the late Ming Dynasty, and it has been more than 300 years since then. There are Catholic believers all over China, but naturally, compared to the total population, this number still accounts for a very small percentage. We cannot deny that the spread of Catholicism has had a positive influence on China. We believe that Bishop Tian Gengxin's appointment as a cardinal will lead to a closer connection and deeper integration between Eastern morality and Western spirit, which contains the significance of not only increasing our international honor, but also being of great importance to the future of our nation.</p>

<p>The Second Landlord Acts Like a Fox Borrowing the Tiger's Authority</p>
<p>Editor: We, the undersigned, reside at No. 973, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Tongren Road, a total of 21 households. The house was previously operated by Zhao Wenqiu, the second landlord, who opened the Weilai Hotel. After cleaning up, the business was closed, and all water and electricity expenses were self-paid. After the victory, Zhao Wenqiu suddenly had a whimsical idea and wanted to sell the business to others to reopen the hotel. Therefore, he first asked the tenants to illegally increase the rent in order to drive them out, and wanted to charge 1,000 yuan per room per day according to the hotel charging method. The tenants refused because the house did not have hotel facilities and could not charge so much. At the same time, because the second landlord was applying for a hotel license, they inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. After the bureau sent personnel to investigate, they found the tenants' reasons to be valid and revoked the license, and replied in a public letter No. 296, City Finance Photo 35 on January 9. Unexpectedly, when the second landlord saw that this plan did not work, he came up with another evil plan. At 12:00 midnight on January 15, he suddenly arrived with police officers No. "3133" and No. "2665" who claimed to be from the Jing'an Temple Police Station and checked the rooms of each tenant. This kind of behavior has never happened in more than ten years. The tenants were woken up from their sleep unexpectedly and were mostly frightened. Those who opened the door a little late were rewarded with a slap in the face. In addition to individually asking about their occupation and name, the two police officers also showed real guns to threaten them, ordering each tenant to hand over the key to the room and equip them with the same key for the use of the second landlord. In this way, the personal property of each tenant is not guaranteed at all. If a theft occurs, who will be responsible? Moreover, since the police came to check the rooms, they did not check the room of Mr. Lin En, a British national living in the same apartment. Now that China has leaped to become one of the four great powers, it is even more incomprehensible that the police still value foreigners and despise Chinese so much, and create such distinctions. Therefore, we have specially written a letter to inform you and ask you to make it public, and to know whether the second landlord's behavior is legal and what basis the two police officers have. How can we enjoy the freedom of residence? We also ask for guidance, which would be greatly appreciated! All tenants of No. 973, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Sincerely.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>We Also Shed Tears to Speak</h3>
<p>On the opening day of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shao Cong'en, a venerable old man of 75, made a sincere appeal, saying, "I came to the meeting despite my illness, shedding tears as I speak," which moved the entire assembly. If all the attending members possessed conscience, the situation of the conference over the past week should have been filled with even more frequent good news. However, according to reports from various sources, while heated debates and lively discussions were seen at the conference, the destruction of roads and mines on the battlefields continued unabated. Moreover, in the general assembly on the 16th, Mr. Shao Lizi also very gently asked everyone to speak fairly. It is evident that the previous Mr. Shao's tears and words did not achieve the expected effect, causing the other Mr. Shao to become anxious and appeal for fairness. We journalists, being neither members of the "Political Consultative Conference" nor having formed any association in our capacity as journalists, even if political parties participate in the "Political Consultative Conference," can say a few words from outside the conference. Though we dare not claim to be fair, we can at least represent a portion of the populace. Today, we also follow Mr. Shao, shedding tears as we speak, hoping that the gentlemen of the "Political Consultative Conference" will not ignore that it contains the endless blood and tears of the people!</p>
<p>First and foremost, the common people ask the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference to be true to their word. We have no time to inquire which party or faction you represent, or whether you represent only yourselves without belonging to any party or faction. It would be wonderful if the common people could live in peace and prosperity, allowing you to do as you please. However, when you hold meetings, you must first have a common principle to adhere to, at least achieving "being true to your word." Otherwise, even if you deceive yourselves temporarily, you cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the world. If anyone's words are not to be trusted, even ordinary friendships cannot be maintained; what is the point of forming a party? What is the point of consultation? Before the conference, the Communist Party already extensively publicized its willingness for "unconditional ceasefire," saying extremely sweet words! You gentlemen love to hear it, and we also love to hear it. However, the ceasefire order has been issued for many days, and telegrams and leaflets can reach remote villages. Why, then, did the Communist army attack its rear, occupy Yingkou, and invade Panshan on the day the National Army entered Shenyang? Why is there still a cloud of war over Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Jehol? Why is the Communist army in southern Shanxi fiercely attacking Quwo, and the Communist army in Suiyuan besieging Jining? If they are destroying railways and damaging coal mines, why is their style unchanged, still prevalent everywhere? The Communist Party constantly says it is for the country and the people, and the common people only hope that is the case. However, five months after victory and nearly ten days of consultation, what we hear is still firing, still attacking cities, still destroying roads, still damaging mines. Even if the Military Mediation Execution Department is established, who can respect and obey it? The ancients said, "Beautiful words are not trustworthy," "Eloquent words are not good." Today, we finally understand that the sweet words of "unconditional ceasefire" are truly too beautiful and too eloquent! But you gentlemen should calculate: How many fleeting days have passed under the anesthesia of these beautiful and eloquent words? How much have the lives and property of the common people been sacrificed? The common people cannot return home, have no place to voice their grievances, and today have the right to make a demand to the gentlemen of the "Political Consultative Conference": If you do not speak, so be it; if you speak, you must be trustworthy, not only "say what you will do" but also "do what you have said." Any of you gentlemen must not only be trustworthy yourselves but also be responsible for preventing others from breaking their promises. If you gentlemen forget this premise and merely want to engage in abstract discussions at the meeting, discussing "topics" widely without seeking practicality, saying things but denying them afterward, breaking promises and still claiming to be party leaders, then the people of the country will not be indebted to you, but you will indeed be indebted to the people of the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, the common people only hope for "returning power to the people, returning the military to the state." These eight characters are also the ten characters of "political democratization, nationalization of the army" agreed upon by both the government and the Communist Party in the Double Tenth Agreement. When the Political Consultative Conference meets, your responsibility lies in discussing the steps to realize these eight or ten characters. Beyond this, you gentlemen have no right to interfere; and if you do not strive for this, you will fail the national government's convocation. Returning power to the people, by natural law, means returning power to the common people, returning power to the National Assembly, not returning power to any one party or faction, or any few parties or factions, let alone returning power to some consultative conference arbitrarily formed by a few people. Whether it is a party, a faction, a society, an association, consultation, or a conference, if it has not been elected by the common people, no one can claim to be a representative who can accept the national government's return of power, and no conference can intend to replace the future National Assembly. If even this is not understood, thinking that gathering a group of people is enough to boast and take the stage, calling themselves democratic, and believing themselves to be the source of power, then today the "Rural Construction Society" can become a faction, why can't the "Municipal Association" become a faction tomorrow? Today the "Vocational Education Society" can become a faction, why can't the "Children's Education Society" become a faction tomorrow? Today the "Democratic League" can be called a party, why can't the "Democratic National Construction Association" be called a party tomorrow? Today the "National Liberation Action Committee" can be called a party. Why can't the "China Labor Association" be called a party tomorrow? Today you gentlemen can be praised as social elites, tomorrow some gentry and some workers are also social elites, and are social elites limited to just these few people? You gentlemen should consider, if it is said that with the Political Consultative Conference or the Political Participation Council, the National Assembly can be postponed, and with party factionalism, the government can be reorganized, and the National Assembly is delayed, wouldn't it be laughable! The National Government originally scheduled the National Assembly to be convened in the winter of the 26th year, but it was repeatedly postponed due to the War of Resistance. Since everyone wants to see the end of the period of political tutelage and the return of power to the people as soon as possible, there is naturally only one way: convening the National Assembly as scheduled on May 5th. Today, the common people will not allow the national government to break its promise to the people again under any pretext, and the representatives elected by the people according to law have no reason to obey any individual or organization that can arbitrarily deny or cancel it. People suffer from not knowing themselves! We ask those who loudly advocate the cancellation of representatives to first examine themselves: By what qualification can they freely and loudly deny the representatives elected by the people! We believe that whether the government is sincere in returning power to the people depends on whether it still convenes the National Assembly as scheduled, and whether the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference are sincere in consulting on returning power to the people also depends on whether the conference can agree on specific measures for convening the National Assembly on May 5th.</p>
<p>As for "returning the military to the state," that is even simpler. The so-called returning the military to the state means that no party, individual, or local area is allowed to have troops; only the state is allowed to have troops. In other words, only the central government is allowed to have the supreme power of military administration and military command. Based on this point, any reorganization, training, deployment, selection, and management of any troops should be entirely determined by the central government. Now that the National Army has already abolished the Kuomintang's party branches, and its command belongs to the supreme commander of the state, what needs to be resolved at present is the issue of reorganizing the Communist army. There should be no dodging and weaving, avoiding the main topic. Mr. Zhang Qun once said that if the reorganization of the Communist army is not completed, the cessation of conflict cannot be considered a permanent peace. What the common people care about, and what has been hanging in the balance for several years, is how to rein in this Communist army that is "waiting for a price to be assessed." Last spring, when the government and the Communist Party representatives met in Xi'an, the Communist Party requested to organize twelve divisions, and the government agreed to organize ten divisions. Later, when Mao Zedong went to Chongqing, the Communist Party suddenly requested to organize forty-eight divisions, and after repeated consultations, at least twenty divisions. Other countries are reducing troops after the war, but the Communist Party wants to increase troops after the war, which is extremely strange! Moreover, the Communist Party demands where its troops must be stationed and that its officers must be recommended by it. If it is as they say, then it is "returning the military to the state" in name, but "keeping the military to the party" in reality! The common people's request is very simple and clear. When the government reorganizes the Communist army, it may discuss the number, but after the reorganization, how the defense areas, supplies, officers, training, and deployment should be absolutely the same as the general National Army, with no exceptions whatsoever. Otherwise, how is it different from the Zhou Dynasty's feudalism and the Tang Dynasty's warlords? Moreover, the reorganization of the army was originally scheduled to be negotiated by a separate three-person military group, but at this time the Communist Party is deliberately changing the game and wants to drag it into the "Political Consultative Conference" to delay the time. What is their sincerity? What is their credibility? The Communist Party representative, Lu Dingyi, always says "forced onto Liangshan." Even if they are forced, then the "heroes of Liangshan" who demand "amnesty and enlistment" must also take down their long-held independent banner as soon as possible! If the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference only know how to perfunctorily accommodate and only seek temporary appearances, without promoting the immediate reorganization of the Communist army by the military group, they will inevitably greatly violate the true meaning of "returning the military to the state," which is not what the common people expect.</p>
<p>We, the common people, have suffered enough for eight years! We have suffered the bitterness of being slaughtered by violent enemies, the bitterness of being oppressed by traitors, the bitterness of being exploited by corrupt officials, the bitterness of being harassed by bandits and guerrillas, the bitterness of the Communist army attacking cities, looting land, destroying roads, and damaging mines, the bitterness of being exploited by the puppet currency of the traitors, and even the bitterness of being forced by the Communist army to use "resistance currency" to plunder supplies!... Future disasters are great, and suffering is endless! Today, a ray of light lies entirely in the "Political Consultative Conference." We respectfully shed tears on behalf of the common people and appeal to the "Political Consultative Conference," hoping that you gentlemen can truly do as Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "Be responsible to the country, be responsible to the people," and everyone, with a clear conscience, speak fairly, earnestly discuss measures, immediately cease fire, and urge the government to return power to the people and supervise the Communist Party to return the military to the state. Whichever side breaks its promise, may we abandon it together with the world!</p>
<p>Fa Hua Town is Pitch Black</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Our district, located west of Shanghai (named Fa Hua Town), is divided into East, Central, and West Towns. It extends from Hai Ge Road and Lu Jia Road in the east to Da Xi Road and Kai Xuan Road in the west. The entire town is about three li long, with many shops and a large population. Before the war, there were streetlights. After the national army moved west, it was under the trampling of enemy bandits. Many were incomplete. Later, due to the enemy and puppet's lighting restrictions, they were forced to be demolished. As a result, the entire town was almost plunged into a world of darkness at night. During this period, bandits took the opportunity to come out at night, looting people's property or stripping their clothes, making the journey extremely difficult. Since the liberation of our city, we have heard that the authorities have begun to install streetlights in various districts in order, but we have not heard of any such plans for our district. The people of our district yearn for light, and specially ask the relevant authorities to install them quickly. This can slightly improve public security. We deeply hope that the authorities will adopt this suggestion, and the people of the entire Fa Hua area will be fortunate! Sincerely, Tao Ziyuan, a citizen of Fa Hua Town.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Bulls Take Profits at Highs, Gold Market Sentiment is Muted, New Hong Kong Notes Continue Downward</h3>
<p>Shanghai—The market opened flat yesterday. Recent rumors and speculation about new exchange rates were reported in both the North China Daily News and this newspaper, quoting information from financial authorities refuting the rumors. This caused sentiment to shift from excitement to muted. Therefore, although the market reached 936,000 after opening, there were plenty of bulls taking profits at the highs. Sichuan banks also offered supply, and the market soon declined again. US dollars remained loose and plentiful, with a swap price of 625 yuan. There were swap sellers in the gold market, causing the price to fall to 913,000. Thereafter, demand and supply gradually became balanced, and the market entered a stable state, hovering around 920,000. There was no change at noon. Both current and forward markets were fluctuating slightly around 920,000. As a result, the closing price fell by 8,000 compared to the previous session. Gold jewelry was priced at 99,000, silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars fluctuated at 460. The unofficial interest rate remained between 8% and 11%, but there were not many positions. Both the stock and gold markets felt the pressure. Major players tried every means possible but were still not satisfied with the current market prices. Some in the industry are gradually taking the opportunity to exit. Although there may be a rally in the future, it is likely to be a lot of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange—US dollars still lack special stimulation. Physical dollars continue to flow out. At the start of trading, the swap price for gold reached around 625 yuan. Therefore, there was swap buying at the lows. Although the process was in a downtrend, it was still very peaceful. After 1,500 yuan, it followed the gold price and fell slightly. At noon and in the afternoon, it was sluggish around 1,480 yuan. The swap price was slightly reduced. The final swap price was 620 yuan per ten taels. Old Hong Kong dollars recovered 10 yuan due to demand from Guangdong banks. New Hong Kong dollars, however, continued to be sold off due to disappointment from excessive speculation. Guangdong banks did not have the appetite at this price and continued to decline. As a result, the closing price fell by another 3 yuan compared to the previous session.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Reach Saturation Point, All Parties Wait and See, Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Weakening</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to gather strength under sporadic trading. They rose first and then fell, but remained stable in the end. Although more funds were absorbed by Type C bonds, it was difficult to exceed the 2,000 mark. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Type A, B, and D bonds each rose by 120 yuan, Type C bonds rose by 50 yuan, and Type E bonds rose by 70 yuan. All parties are waiting and seeing.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market was stable. Major hot stocks fluctuated above the previous closing price. However, the less popular stocks softened again due to a lack of speculation and someone looking to sell. After 11 o'clock, the corridor was too crowded, and many wires were broken, causing disputes and interference. The market closed earlier. As a result, Wing On Textile rose slightly, Mei Ah remained flat, and the three minor hot stocks fell slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly stable yesterday. The process fluctuated. In general, hot stocks showed signs of recovery. Cold stocks and rubber stocks were slightly weak due to few buyers. The result at the noon close, compared to the previous close, showed that the hot stocks of Ewo Cotton Mill, Ewo Yarns, Paper Industries, Union Insurance Society of Canton, and Wheelock &amp; Co. all rebounded, while rubber stocks fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Trading is Sparse, Sichuan Banks Absorb Light-Colored Goods</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market stabilized yesterday. There were some transactions in Shi Lin blue cloth from Hankou banks. However, because some factories such as Xinfu and Xinfeng had already opened in small quantities, and there was still a lot of spot goods remaining in the market, a supply-demand balance was created. With the New Year approaching, it is necessary to put on the brakes and temporarily come to a conclusion. Sichuan banks continued to absorb light-colored goods such as striped poplin and silk for spring sales. Other than that, there were only sporadic transactions, embellishing the market. White cloth and fine cloth are still in short supply, so dyeing and weaving factories are very interested in those with large amounts of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market is Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market was very lackluster yesterday. There were few transactions from customer banks, and the industry was also taking a wait-and-see attitude. Spot goods from double-thread mills had a way out to weaving factories and were considered stable. 20-count and 16-count yarn fell by about 10,000 yuan. Sentiment was scattered, and the trend showed signs of weakness. Yarn factories and spinning construction companies were inclined to sell, and some hoarders, who had been holding on for many years, were also found in the market.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices are Slightly Weak, Flour Exports are Active</h3>
<p>The rice market in North China turned weak. Store appetite remained low. Both southern and northern japonica rice were weak by 100-200 yuan. White indica rice was also weak by over 100 yuan. There were more arrivals in the oil market, and exports were stagnant. Store appetite was not strong, and it fell by another thousand yuan. Sales were sluggish. Soybean cake tended to be flat. Soybeans also lacked prosperity. Raw peanuts, with a surge in arrivals from Linhuai Pass, saw a sharp increase of nearly 2,000 yuan. However, flour was active in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang markets, and prices continued to rise sharply, increasing by another hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Rise Again, Artificial Silk Also Rises by 10%</h3>
<p>The rayon market opened yesterday with 120 denier rayon at 1,300,000 yuan at the Sky Bridge, and transactions were immediately made. The highest price was 1,400,000 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,320,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at 1,350,000 yuan, which was 150,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Warehouse receipts had a minimum of 950,000 yuan and a maximum of 990,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 970,000 yuan. The price fluctuations were unstable, and trading suddenly became lively. Some were selling spot goods at high prices and buying warehouse receipts to cover, while others were selling warehouse receipts and buying spot goods to cover. There were many transactions between industry players, with warehouse receipts being the most common. Wu Chang had the strongest buying interest. Factory managers, who had been depressed for days, were also unwilling to show weakness yesterday. Artificial silk rose by 10% compared to the previous day. There were transactions between industry players and customer banks. Silk goods initially advanced in trading, but the market later recovered slightly. Mei Ah bedspreads traded at 810,000 yuan per hundred, with a high of 850,000 yuan, later trading at 775,000 yuan. Da Cheng ge bi crepe traded at a maximum of 2,450 yuan per yard, later trading at 2,300 yuan. Minsheng brocade traded at a price of 11,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Silk Weavers Request the Release of Sealed Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Silk Weavers' Industry Association was reorganized and established on the 15th. The association, in view of the recent soaring prices of raw materials and the inability of silk goods prices to catch up, which will inevitably force manufacturers to stop work and affect the lives of workers, plans to jointly request the authorities to allocate the sealed raw materials for silk weaving in warehouses to various factories in order to stabilize market prices and maintain the lives of workers.</p>
<h3>After the Lifting of Controls, Inland Yarn Mills Are Active</h3>
<p>The major textile mills in the rear areas, which were previously subject to the control of the Flower and Yarn Bureau, had their original stockpiles purchased by the bureau and processed by the bureau using the method of exchanging flowers for yarn and yarn for cloth, collecting processing fees. Since the end of the War of Resistance, the control measures were abolished on November 15, 1945. The factories, depleted of raw materials and funds, mostly fell into a state of suspension or reduced production for a time. The bureau then approved the return of cotton stored in 1943 to the factories at 60% of its value. It has been learned that factories such as Cai Jiapu, Xianyang, Yejing, Yufeng, Yuhua, Shenxin, and Shashi Dahua, with the amount of raw materials returned being limited and a portion difficult to allocate immediately, have applied to the National Bank for loans to purchase raw materials.</p>
<h3>White Coal Nuggets are Slightly Lower, Anthracite Fine Coal is Stable</h3>
<p>Coal market conditions are diverging. White coal nuggets are experiencing lower prices due to sluggish sales. Many distributors are discounting prices due to tight credit, but there are still few buyers, and prices may fall further. Anthracite coal blocks have been rising for days, and some are spitting out at high prices, but there is limited physical goods. As real end-users search for purchases, the market atmosphere has become stronger. Anthracite coal fines are slightly moving at factory sales, and prices are rising with the anthracite coal blocks.</p>
<h3>Road Iron is Selling Well</h3>
<p>6/20 Road Iron, commonly known as packing iron, has been in high demand recently due to the smooth flow of the Yangtze River ships, convenient transportation, and frequent exchange of goods. Actual sales are increasing daily, and customer banks are also purchasing a lot, so prices are firm. It currently sells for around 300,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Stores and Customer Banks Compete to Handle, Tea Sales Are Extremely Active</h3>
<p>Regarding red and green tea varieties, the stores on this street are very interested in adding new varieties in order to meet the needs of the market. Sales from customer banks are also not bad, so trading has been extremely active in recent days, and prices are showing sharp strength.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Resolved Soon, New York Cotton Market Balanced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] The New York cotton market opened steadily yesterday. The rumor of a potential strike resolution caused the prices to go up two to four points. The rumors from Washington of potential massive amounts of low-grade cotton to be shipped to occupied nations garnered attention, but the cotton market remained unaffected. Traders maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The prices increased one to three points around noon. The prices then fell at the end of the afternoon, as well as a large amount of searches for purchases. A surge in the number of purchases increased the prices. The market remained very stable in the end due to minimal sales.</p>
<h3>US Department of Agriculture Approves Production Volume This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The US Department of Agriculture has approved the total production volume of agricultural products in 1946. The final target is 296,001,000 acres. Last year’s total production volume was 286,832,000 acres. The comparison of the production volume of various agricultural products between the two years is as follows (unit: hundred acres):</p>
<p>|              | 1946    | 1945    |</p>
<p>|--------------|---------|---------|</p>
<p>| Cotton       | 20,200  | 18,157  |</p>
<p>| Wheat        | 68,875  | 68,781  |</p>
<p>| Rye          | 2,572   | 1,981   |</p>
<p>| Soybeans     | 9,590   | 10,873  |</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Speculation</h3>
<p>The financial authorities of this city have recently noted that speculation in the market is increasing, and have dispatched personnel to conduct a strict investigation. In particular, the recent failure of short sellers in the bond market to deliver goods has caused disputes, which is taken very seriously and will be resolutely cracked down on.</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>The price of Longan from various locations is rising. The top-quality large-sized longan opened at 2,000 yuan higher yesterday, with more than a hundred transactions. Because the market activity for large pieces of dried longan is high, opening prices were also tight, with high-quality goods rising by nearly 10%. Orders for saccharin in the western medicine market are about to begin, and pharmacies have already started selling in advance.</p>
<p>Among the cosmetics market prices yesterday, only soap was firm. Customer banks were searching for it at high prices.</p>
<p>Knitted goods were slightly higher in price yesterday due to the smaller amount of goods in circulation. Yanshou cotton sweaters, which had been quiet for several days, rebounded yesterday, with fifty or sixty dozen transactions.</p>
<p>With Wing Tai Wo continuing to distribute cigarettes and Hua Shang and other factories also distributing, the spot goods on the market increased suddenly. With supply exceeding demand, the market is trending downward.</p>
<p>The issue of reopening the Hua Shang Yarn and Cloth Exchange has not yet been approved by the financial authorities. Although the industry's reorganization committee has an active plan for reopening, it must wait for an order from the authorities before it can proceed. Rumors that the exchange will reopen this month are inaccurate.</p>
<p>The four small factories sold by the Bureau for the Disposal of Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region, including the Tianzhong Mining Factory, the Wanguo Rubber Machinery and Goods Factory, the Shanghai Automatic Punishment Machine Factory, and the Qinghe Factory, have had their property rights disputed by the Zhonghua Brothers Company Iron Factory, which has appealed to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Today's Guiyang Steamer to Hong Kong: A Large Batch of Smuggled Goods Discovered – Cotton Cloth and Ajinomoto Disguised as Medicinal Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The British steamer SS Chanda arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month with 4,000 tons of relief supplies from New York. It docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload its cargo, which is now cleared. It is scheduled to set sail this afternoon, passing through Hong Kong and the Mediterranean Sea before returning to London. It is carrying 45,000 bags of relief flour to Hong Kong. A total of 24 people are traveling to Hong Kong on this British steamer. After unloading the flour in Hong Kong, the ship will return to England. The Guiyang steamer, managed by the British Far East Shipping Company, is also scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, carrying 23,000 bags of relief flour. Since the ban on transporting cotton yarn and cloth overseas, such goods have disappeared from ships sailing to Hong Kong. Yesterday, while loading the Guiyang steamer, a large batch of cotton cloth and Ajinomoto was discovered mixed in with medicinal materials. Customs officers seized these goods. It is reported that the smuggled cotton cloth was being transported by Shen'an Transportation Company, and the Ajinomoto was declared by Shenchangxiang Transportation Company, both disguised as medicinal materials when reporting to the shipping company. The amount seized during loading was considerable, but the exact figure is unknown.</p>
<h3>National Construction Savings Bonds in US Dollars: Principal and Interest Can Be Withdrawn in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Upon maturity of the US Dollar National Construction Savings Bonds, the bondholders should withdraw the principal and interest from the original issuing bank or bureau, as stipulated in Article 5 of the regulations for issuing US Dollar National Construction Savings Bonds. Various banks and bureaus have designated their branches to exchange for US military drafts, mostly in the free areas. Recently, some bondholders in Shanghai requested to exchange the matured US Dollar Savings Bonds purchased in Chongqing for drafts in Shanghai. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance and the Joint Treasury have stipulated that banks and bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou can handle this through entrustment for the convenience of bondholders.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 17th] Liang Dong, Director of the Songjiang Provincial Education Bureau, led personnel to take over the Provincial First and Second Senior High Schools at 2:00 PM today. The process went very smoothly.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Private School Tuition Fees: The Municipal Education Bureau Convenes a Meeting with Principals and Reaches a Compromise</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] To resolve the issue of private school tuition fees, the Municipal Education Bureau held a discussion meeting with principals of private primary and secondary schools at 2:00 PM yesterday at the bureau. Principals from more than 300 schools, including Minguo, Aiguo, Mingde, Daozhong, Cunde, and Zhengfeng, attended. Bureau Director Gu, directors of various departments, and Inspector Cheng Kuancheng of the Ministry of Education were present. Director Gu gave a report, stating: "I am well aware of the financial difficulties of private schools. Although the fee standards set by the bureau are very different from those agreed upon with the schools, they were based on the affordability of parents. If the full amount is distributed to teachers, their livelihoods should not be a problem. As for school operating expenses, the bureau originally intended for each school to be responsible, but it is now known that the school boards cannot maintain this. The bureau will request the mayor's assistance so that education in the city can develop day by day. As for increasing tuition fees, the municipal government and the bureau originally could not advise it, but what can we do if parents cannot afford it? It is best to compromise: on the one hand, please solicit donations from parents, and the bureau will not interfere." Subsequently, representatives from private schools, including Jiang Jizhou, Sun Xiangzhong, Cui Jianwu, and Wei Dunyi, listed several difficulties, which Director Gu answered separately:</p>
<p>Director's Opinion</p>
<p>(Point 1) The method adopted in the past was the Soviet Union's fee system. Soviet schools were all public, so the situation was slightly different, and there were no difficulties. The situation in this city is different, so this method will be discussed and implemented after the establishment of the Municipal Council. (Point 2) The previously set tuition fee standards were to avoid criticism from public opinion and to consider the burden on parents, so there was a loan program from the Municipal Bank, and it was also planned to request the mayor to allow primary schools to increase tuition by 2,000, junior high schools by 3,000, and senior high schools by 4,000, and to ask economically affluent parents to donate free school places and equipment. Inspector Cheng of the Ministry of Education reported that the Chongqing Municipal Government had previously restricted private school tuition fees, with senior high school fees capped at 15,000 yuan, and the school board was responsible for the shortfall. The situation in Shanghai is special, and few school boards can bear this responsibility. It is fortunate for the future of Shanghai education that the heads of the schools can openly discuss with the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Private School Requests</p>
<p>Later, private schools made several requests: (1) They requested the municipal government to issue a subsidy of 5,400 in the second semester. (2) They requested that a portion of the enemy and puppet properties be used as a subsidy and compensation for the losses of various schools. (3) The municipal government's allocation of school funding is not sufficient in fact, because 50% of the municipal government's income has been used for police bureau expenses. After the Municipal Council is established, they will request an increase. Finally, Director Gu replied: "I will do my best to contact the relevant parties. As for tuition fees, if you still think there are difficulties, I am still willing to help find a solution." Therefore, if private school tuition fees are not changed again next semester, the approximate amounts will be 8,000 yuan for primary schools, 12,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 16,000 yuan for senior high schools.</p>

<h3>Black and White Team Makes a Lasting Impression: Defeats Chen Hong by One Point Yesterday; Hehe Potassium Fertilizer Friend Cup: Xie Xing Beats Shan Team</h3>
<p>In the Chenyou Cup basketball league, there were two matches last night. In the final match, the Black and White team of the Expeditionary Force faced the Chenyou Hong team. The audience was extremely enthusiastic, and the atmosphere in the Youth Hall was feverish.</p>
<p>In the first league match, Donghua played against Xie Xing. Donghua's performance was not weak, and Xie Xing found it difficult to win. The first half was a seesaw battle, with the score difference only one or two points. The final score was tied at 17 each. After the break, the game remained tight. Although Zhang Banglun and Zhang Lingen of Donghua were fouled out four times, their fighting power did not diminish. Until the end of the game, Xie Xing only won by a narrow margin of 34 to 32.</p>
<p>Next, the Shan team played against the Green Forest team. The situation was also very tense, because the Green Forest players performed well, and even a strong team like the Shan team felt it was difficult. In the first half, Green Forest was only one point behind at 8 to 9. After switching sides, the Shan team gradually gained the upper hand, while the Green Forest team lacked the energy. When the final buzzer sounded, the Shan team won 22 to 14, maintaining their undefeated honor.</p>
<p>In the final match, the Black and White team played against the Chenyou Hong team. The latter was resting and prepared, so they led from the beginning, leading 15 to 8 in the first half. After the break, Chenyou Hong underestimated their opponent and made frequent mistakes, allowing the Black and White team to seize the opportunity. In the last minute, Yao Hongsen scored, reversing the defeat and winning 33 to 32, defeating Chenyou Hong.</p>
<p>The Black and White team played four matches during this visit to Shanghai, with half wins and half losses. Their performance was still good, and their sportsmanship was particularly good, which was appreciated by fans. Now that their schedule here is over, they are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Xixi today.</p>
<p>The results of the three matches last night are as follows:</p>
<p>Xie Xing defeated Donghua (A): 34 to 32</p>
<p>Shan Team defeated Green Forest (A): 22 to 14</p>
<p>Black and White defeated Chenyou Hong (Friendship): 33 to 32</p>

<h3>A New Nation, A New Education</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhi</p>
<p>— Introducing the "National College of Social Education" —</p>
<p>With a heart filled with excitement and sincerity, on a clear winter afternoon, this writer arrived at the temporary location of the National College of Social Education in Bishan, Sichuan. Bishan, an obscure small mountain town, quietly lies nestled among the mountains about sixty kilometers northwest of Chongqing. The Yu-Cheng Highway winds its way through here. The college is located on a high slope in the northwest corner of the town. As I climbed a hundred or so stone steps, between rows of ancient trees lining the path, the signboard of the "National College of Social Education" gloriously unfolded before my eyes.</p>
<p>The melodious sound of a piano seemed to welcome me, a visiting guest. Inside the gate was a wide and open sports field, where many students were actively engaged in various ball games. The surroundings of the field looked very clean and tidy, and the air was filled with vitality and harmony everywhere.</p>
<p>Chen Lijiang as President</p>
<p>I met President Chen Lijiang in a secluded and simple guest room. Mr. Chen is a leading educational scholar in China. He has been engaged in social education work for nearly twenty years. He has made the greatest contribution to the preservation of Chinese social education's development today. He has made indelible contributions to the establishment of social education theory and the advancement of social education causes. He has the demeanor of a typical educator: kind, gentle, generous, and eloquent in conversation, which demonstrates his rich scholarship and abundant vitality. He seems to possess a kind of touching power over young people in general, which makes a stranger feel close and a familiar person feel warm.</p>
<p>The National College of Social Education was established in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), with only four years of history to date. When it was first established, the third and fourth-year students of the Social Education Department of Jiangsu Provincial College of Education and the College of Education of Great China University were ordered to merge into the college. Therefore, there have been four graduating classes with more than 300 graduates, scattered in many social education institutions and schools throughout the country, carrying forward the educational spirit of the college and winning general praise from society.</p>
<p>Contributions of Experts</p>
<p>Several famous scholars and experts have come to participate in the creation of this undertaking. Mr. Chen Lijiang has been in charge of the college since its inception. In addition, experts such as Zhuang Zeyi, Du Zuozhou, Qiu Chun, Xu Deheng, Chang Zhi, Chen Jianhong, Jiang Qi, Chen Dongyuan, Yu Songhua, Tong Runzhi, Zhu Yisong, Lü Fengzi, Dong Zhichuan, Jiao Juyin, Zhang Junxiang, and Liu Xuechang have all contributed or are currently contributing their greatest energy and wisdom to promote the greater development of this undertaking.</p>
<p>The college currently has four academic departments, three specialized courses, and one academic group, namely the Department of Social Education Administration, the Department of Social Work Administration, the Department of Library and Museum Science, the Department of Journalism, the Specialized Course in Radio and Visual Education, the Specialized Course in Art Education, the Specialized Course in Mandarin Education, and the Group of Ritual and Custom Administration. In terms of organization, the Group of Ritual and Custom Administration is attached to the Department of Social Work Administration, but the number of people in this group is particularly large, and it has become an independent class in form.</p>
<p>Students from all over the country</p>
<p>Students come from all over the country, except for Xinjiang, Taiwan, Mongolia and Tibet. Although they come from different places, have different living habits, and have different beliefs, they live and study together in this educational environment and get along very harmoniously and intimately. Students receive a full scholarship. Tuition and meal expenses are waived, and a monthly allowance and a uniform fee are issued each semester. In addition, there are various scholarships to encourage students' moral character, academic diligence, research, and creation. Students' lives are very disciplined in all aspects, including daily life, diet, flag-raising exercises, and homework, all of which have a kind of automatic discipline. In the studios, in the library, in the clubs, and on the sports field, there is a sense of order and solemnity, filled with youthful vigor. Various research associations, dozens of wall newspapers along the cultural corridor, competitions in lectures, papers, sports, production, social services, etc., enhance their interests in all aspects and strengthen their desire for knowledge and enterprising spirit.</p>
<p>School as a Social Entity</p>
<p>The school and society are integrated, and they have done it quite thoroughly. In this environment, one can see that the phenomenon of "school socialization, social education" has quite developed the function of "school as a social and cultural center." For example, they have successively run six sessions of middle school-level tutoring classes, more than ten people's schools, and dozens of people's inquiry offices; during the winter and summer vacations, they conduct people's visits and surveys on rural economy, farmers' lives, and educational levels; provide job placement services; assist local governments in developing construction work; contact social groups to engage in various people's activities; regularly screen movies, perform dramas, and hold art exhibitions, photo exhibitions, and music performances to entertain the people; install airplanes, announce important telegrams, and report news to the people; and pay special attention to library promotion, establishing dozens of newspaper and reading rooms and organizing mobile libraries. They are doing all these things down-to-earth.</p>
<p>Open Course Selection</p>
<p>The college has also established a new model in China for the promotion of university education. The most important are "open course selection" and "public academic lectures." Open course selection is to give unemployed youth with a general university education level and public officials on the job the opportunity to learn the knowledge and skills they urgently need. All courses in each department of the college with vacant seats that are needed by the general youth outside the college are open for them to select and study, and lecture notes and reference materials are provided. In the past four years, more than 50 courses have been selected, and more than 600 students have been selected. Public academic lectures involve inviting famous scholars from home and abroad to give lectures at the college. A public notice is issued to the public in advance, welcoming the public to attend freely. In the past four years, there have been 68 lectures, with approximately 30,000 attendees from outside the college. In addition, "special topic Q&amp;A" is held. If the public has specialized academic or technical questions, they can submit them to the college for answers or directly discuss them with a certain professor; the "Social Education Correspondence Research Society" is organized to assist social education practitioners in research and further study.</p>
<p>Promotion Committee Design</p>
<p>The many civil education undertakings and promotion work mentioned above are mostly designed and implemented by the "Promotion Committee." In terms of academic research, there is the establishment of a "Research Department" as a central institution for researching social education academic and social education methods. Currently, the Research Department is headed by the famous education scholar Mr. Zhuang Zeyi. The work of the Research Department is to assist teachers and students in researching various aspects of social education, and it can also be said to be researching various aspects of Chinese society; encouraging students to organize various academic groups to increase their research interest, and at the same time, contacting experts outside the college to engage in collective research work. In the past year, the focus has been on the research of social education construction in China after the war. There are profound conclusions on the changes in Chinese society after the war, how social education should coordinate with these changes, and how to make social education lead the transformation of Chinese education. The two issues of "Education and Society" (the name of the college-edited publication, now in its fourth volume) to be published in the next issue of this year are reports on this research.</p>
<p>Main Affiliated Institutions</p>
<p>Here, I would like to add a point about the affiliated institutions of the college. The main ones are the National Education Experimental Zone, the Experimental Social Service Center, the Affiliated Middle School, and the Affiliated Social Education Normal School, etc.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of national education, supplementary education for out-of-school people has been officially included in the school system, in order to address the difficult problems and solutions that arise during implementation. The Experimental Social Service Center is a facility for social service in the experimental county unit. The affiliated middle school experiments with the middle school as the cultural center of the county unit, with the aim of thoroughly reforming middle school education in the future. The Social Education Normal School trains intermediate social education talents. In the future, each province will generally establish them. The college's affiliated Social Education Normal School experiments with the curriculum and practices of the Social Education Normal School to serve as a demonstration for the Social Education Normal Schools in each province of the country and hopes to find a way to reform the entire normal education.</p>
<p>Future Development Plan</p>
<p>Now the War of Resistance has won the final victory, and the work of nation-building will take a long time. In the future, the National College of Social Education will have the greatest impact on nation-building. In the rehabilitation plan, the permanent campus of the college is located in Qixia Mountain, Nanjing. Currently, President Chen has formulated the college's development plan for the next five years, preparing to add five departments this year: Physical Education, Radio and Visual Education, Art Education, Drama Education, and Music Education. Next year, two departments, Livelihood Education and Health Education, will be added. The Livelihood Education Department includes groups such as cooperation, crafts, agricultural extension, and land administration, focusing on people's livelihood and economy. The Health Education Department focuses on the training of rural health personnel. In the third year, the Department of Library and Museum Science will be divided into the Department of Library Science and the Department of Museum Science; the Department of Radio and Visual Education will be divided into the Department of Film Education and the Department of Broadcasting Education. In the fourth and fifth years, departments such as Labor Education and Home Economics Education will be added respectively. The existing specialized courses will continue to be offered.</p>
<p>Social education is the basic force for promoting new construction, and the National College of Social Education is the central source of this basic force.</p>
<p>The future of new China's construction is beautiful, and the work is arduous. We place infinite hope on Chinese social education, and on the National College of Social Education, which has grown up in arduous struggle. (January 15, 35th year of the Republic of China, in Chongqing)</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Passes Eight Standards for Handling Labor Disputes: No Petitioning or Gathering Crowds Under False Pretenses; Entertainment Tax Increased to 50 Percent; Organizational Rules for District Offices Also Passed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 17th municipal council meeting on the morning of the 18th, chaired by Mayor Qian. The matters discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>Decisions on Important Cases</p>

It is now proposed to draft provisional standards for handling labor disputes in Shanghai. It was submitted for decision and passed.</p>
<p>Business License Tax</p>
<p>The collection regulations for business license tax passed by the municipal council have a total of 18 articles, with Appendix 1. The main points are: (1) Operators in Shanghai, regardless of their organization or name, whether they are exclusively or concurrently operated, shall apply to the competent collection agency for a business license tax application form, fill it out in detail, and after the amount of business license tax payable is verified and paid, a business license will be issued before they are allowed to open for business.

<p>Opening of Zhenning Road</p>
<p>The area around Yuyuan Road and West Zhongzheng Road in western Shanghai is low-lying, and the original ditches are not perfect. Whenever it rains, there is flooding. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has repeatedly surveyed and found that in order to prevent flooding in the area, it is necessary to open up Zhenning Road and set up new ditches to divert rainwater into the Suzhou River in order to achieve both temporary and permanent solutions. Zhenning Road starts from the White House Funeral Home on West Zhongzheng Road, runs along Yuguang Village, crosses Yuyuan Road, then passes through Lane 668, and ends at Fanwangdu Road, with a total length of 840 meters. It was originally within the scope of the western Shanghai road system announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). At that time, the width was stipulated to be 15 meters. It was decided to still construct according to the original route and width, and lay ditches and pave the road surface for drainage and traffic.</p>

<h3>Circuit Inspection Group Proclamation: Enforcing Discipline; Hope That Citizens Will Name and Report Violations</h3>
<p>The First Circuit Inspection Group for Wartime Discipline of the Military Commission, led by Group Leader Zhang Zhen and others, has recently arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, it issued a proclamation in various districts of the city, stating that since the July 7th Incident, the local area has been corrupt, and the people have suffered. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang's moral prestige has inspired and led the appropriate leadership, and the soldiers have worked hard to finally achieve victory. After the war, rehabilitation is needed, and the people's livelihood is difficult, and there is an urgent need to restore order and maintain security. Other post-war problems need to be solved urgently. The group has been ordered to enforce discipline and conduct circuit inspections in the designated areas. It will conduct practical investigations of its powers and responsibilities and will correct them at any time in order to achieve practical results. If there are any grievances or pains among the military and civilians, or if there are any opinions on local rehabilitation that can be improved, they should be submitted for review.

Once verified, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Eliminate Opium and Drugs Within Two Years</h3>

<h3>Enemy Landing Craft Converted to City Ferry</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works stated: The city is extremely short of transportation tools in the Huangpu River, and a portion of it still relies on sampans and ferries. Two Japanese military landing craft previously received by the Navy General Headquarters have been transferred to Shanghai for ferry use. The conversion and repairs have been completed, and a trial voyage was held yesterday with good results. It is said that the Shanghai Ferry Preparatory Office has designated a route to participate in the voyage to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Strict Regulations on Advance Booking of First-Class Private Rooms on Two Railways</h3>

If passengers are very crowded and it is not possible to book private rooms, they should politely decline. Yesterday, notices were sent to various agencies and stations to cooperate in complying.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaosong Discusses the Significance of Streamlining the Baojia System and Promoting the Spirit of Citizen Autonomy</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to a statement by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, the streamlining of the Baojia system in this city began on the 15th of this month and has been underway for several days. In general, the situation is satisfactory, but a portion of citizens are reluctant to take office when appointed as Jia Chiefs or Bao Chiefs. He stated that during the enemy and puppet regime's occupation, virtuous or knowledgeable individuals avoided taking office because they disdained collaborating with the enemy. Now that the sun has shone again and the central government is promoting the Baojia system, the purpose is to</p>
<p>encourage citizen autonomy. This point became even more concrete after the central government promulgated the organizational guidelines for all levels below the county in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), implementing the new county system. Therefore, the Baojia system was incorporated into the autonomous organization. The past enemy and puppet regime's top-down joint liability and mutual guarantee system will now be thoroughly eradicated. Therefore, for all measures to prevent bandits, eliminate opium, repair bridges and roads, enrich art, etc., citizens must fully utilize the Baojia's grassroots mechanism, the Baomin (Protect the People) Assembly, and incorporate their opinions into the Baojia Covenant,</p>
<p>in order to refer to and implement them, fully promoting the spirit of citizen autonomy. He continued by saying that Shanghai has suffered under decades of concession control and eight years of enemy and puppet occupation. Citizens do not fully understand the actual situation of our country's politics. This streamlining of the Baojia system focuses on promoting the spirit of citizen autonomy, so he earnestly hopes that all citizens will take more responsibility for their own affairs and the affairs of the city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals to Begin Offering Up Hidden Assets Next Week</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, and the Shanghai Japanese National Management Office of the Third Front Army, in order to encourage Japanese nationals in the Nanjing and Shanghai area to voluntarily offer up their hidden assets and miscellaneous items, the two bureaus decided in a joint meeting a month ago to draft measures for the Japanese nationals' offering. It is understood that after the draft of the "Measures for Japanese Nationals Offering Up Hidden Assets and Miscellaneous Items" was drafted, it was submitted to the 28th meeting of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee on January 3 of this year, and approved by President Song during his previous visit to Shanghai. The Japanese National Management Office has already ordered the Japanese nationals under its jurisdiction to strictly comply. The summary of the offering measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Hidden Assets to be Offered in Full</p>

<h3>Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau Uncovers Japanese Hidden Supplies: White Coal, Watches, City Housing, and Large Quantities of Porcelain</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has recently uncovered a large batch of supplies hidden by the Japanese. These include over 500 tons of white coal, 111 city houses on Wusong Road owned by a Japanese real estate company, 290 valuable gold watches, 10 clocks, and a large quantity of porcelain worth over 210,000,000 in puppet currency. In addition, more supplies privately stored by Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, have been discovered. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>500 Tons of Coal Secretly Buried Underground</p>
<p>Currently, the team received a tip-off that a large amount of white coal was buried under vegetable fields in the center of the city in Jiangwan. They dispatched personnel to investigate and discovered approximately 500 tons of white coal buried within a vegetable field that previously occupied an area of about 110 cubic meters in the city center. It was discovered that the coal belonged to the Japanese company Aoyagi Yoko and was secretly buried underground when the Japanese surrendered. To avoid attention, it was still rented to nearby farmers to grow vegetables. For more than five months, the farmers were unaware that there was so much white coal buried underground.</p>
<p>Valuable Gold Watches, Hundreds of City Houses</p>
<p>It was also reported that valuable brand-name gold watches and 111 city houses along Wusong Road were hidden in a room on the second floor of the Hirata Watch Store on Wusong Road, all owned by the Japanese. After investigation, 290 gold watches and 10 large clocks were found in a specially made mechanism on the second floor of the Hirata Store. There were also countless imitation jade and diamonds. To show its seriousness, the team specially requested superiors to send personnel to supervise the inventory and transfer them to the Central Bank for safekeeping. The real estate was found to be assets of a Japanese real estate company, which were registered under the names of Chinese nationals to evade investigation. It has now been reported to the Handling Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Porcelain Worth Tens of Millions</p>
<p>As for the porcelain, it was found in three private warehouses on Wusong Road, Broadway Road, and other locations. Its value is estimated to be over 210,000,000 in puppet currency (over 10,000,000 in legal currency).</p>
<p>Recovered Supplies Filled Twenty Trucks</p>
<p>Other supplies hidden by Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, have also been recovered, but are still under investigation and cannot be disclosed. In short, the supplies recently recovered by the team based on tips amount to about twenty trucks per day.</p>
<h3>Victory Ship to be Received Today, No Ceremony to be Held</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Liberty ship originally scheduled to be received by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday, named "Hai Su," was delayed due to a minor issue with the crew. The problem was resolved yesterday, and the first Victory ship (renamed "Hai Su") is scheduled to be received this morning. The company has agreed with the US Navy authorities to have US representatives visit the company at 7:00 AM this morning, accompanied by the entire crew, and take the prepared launch, "Guo Li," to complete the handover. It is reported that the procedure will be simple and no ceremony will be held. Also, the first batch of 36 Liberty ships' chief mates, second mates, engineers, and engine supervisors will visit each ship from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day starting today. If there are any questions, they can ask the crew on board at any time. The company issued certificates yesterday to facilitate boarding. Once everything is ready, the reception will proceed.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tongzhou Ships Should Report for Duty Upriver</p>
<p>Ships are urgently needed for the recovery of the upper Yangtze River. Vessels plying the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, such as the "Jiang Ding," "Jiang Chang," and "Yuan Feng," have all been requisitioned and will soon be sailing upriver to report for duty. The Shanghai-Tongzhou line is suspended today, with only tugboats towing iron barges carrying cargo to Tiansheng Port, without passengers.</p>
<p>Coal Transport Vessels Still Severely Lacking</p>
<p>According to sources from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, the production of coal mines in North China has gradually increased and approximately 4,000 tons are shipped to Qinhuangdao every day. However, due to the lack of vessels, only two Liberty ships per week are shipping coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, amounting to approximately 80,000 tons per month. As a result of the authorities' efforts, the output of the Huainan coal mine has also increased, producing approximately 1,000 tons per day. However, due to transportation vessel issues, only about 700 tons are shipped to Bengbu daily. Nanjing can only obtain 20,000 tons of Huai coal per month, which is insufficient, so it needs coal from Shanghai to supplement it.</p>
<h3>US Remittances to China Not Paid in US Dollars, Rumors of Hong Kong Dollars Converted to US Remittances are False</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) Yesterday, a person in charge of an American bank in this city told a reporter from this newspaper: US remittances to China have been received slightly in the past ten days, but they are all in small amounts. The funds are all telegraphic transfers or mail transfers issued by the bank's Tianjin and Shanghai branches to New York on demand. As of now, the bank has not disbursed US dollars due to foreign exchange restrictions. Yesterday, newspapers in this city all published a special dispatch from the Central News Agency in New York stating that the US exchange rate was temporarily set at 25 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The person in charge of the bank told the reporter that the rumor was completely inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Temporary Buses Add Second Line, Connecting Nanshi and Zhabei</h3>
<p>To facilitate citizens, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau launched a first circular route in the Nanshi area, where transportation was relatively difficult, on December 10 of last year. Now, a portion of the buses have been repaired, and a second route connecting Nanshi and Zhabei will be added starting from the 20th, starting from the Old North Gate, passing through Henan Road, and ending at the North Railway Station. In between, there will be stops for boarding and alighting at five locations: Zhongzheng Road, Fuzhou Road, Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, and Wusong Road. The fare will be divided into three types based on distance: 40, 50, and 60 national currency. The fare for the first circular route will also be adjusted to a uniform 50 national currency, regardless of distance, and will be implemented simultaneously starting from the 20th.</p>
<h3>Shangxian Hall Women's and Children's Hospital Suddenly Sealed Off</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shangxian Hall Women's and Children's Hospital on Route Doumer, which has been established for nearly 20 years, was notified on the 14th by a certain military officer who claimed to want to take back the building that the hospital should move all patients out before the 20th. Because the hospital had difficulty finding a new location, it requested an extension, but the officer threatened to use force and dispatched several soldiers to "seal off" the entire building, prohibiting patients and doctors from entering or leaving. It is reported that the hospital has reported the incident to the responsible authorities in this city and requested protection.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Flew to Chongqing Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian was approved by the Executive Yuan to become the director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, he flew to Chongqing yesterday morning on a China National Aviation Corporation flight to pay respects to the relevant authorities in the central government and request instructions on everything. He will stay in Chongqing for about a week and then return to Shanghai to take office.</p>
<h3>US Military Forms Military Police Auxiliary Squad</h3>
<p>Because US military personnel in Shanghai sometimes cause trouble, the small number of US military police have difficulty maintaining order. Therefore, British and Russian expatriates in the area have been hired to form a military police auxiliary squad. The auxiliary squad has 590 members, divided into three teams, wearing US military uniforms with armbands bearing the letters "U.S." They cannot fully perform the same tasks as US military police, but when unexpected events involving US military personnel occur, they can perform guard duties, notify the US military police, and maintain order until the US military police arrive. These auxiliary military police are issued special passes by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. For the sake of caution, the US military has taken their fingerprints and photographs.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Nail Factory Owner Zhang Qipin Questioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Qipin, owner of the Fuxing Nail Factory at Zhong'an Bridge, Route Paul Henry, Shanghai, manufactured nails for the enemy for military use during the war. After the victory, he was arrested by the police and transferred to the court. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court by Judge Cao Jun. The defendant stated that in May of last year, several Japanese from the enemy Jiangnan Shipyard came and forced him to manufacture nails. At the time, he refused by saying that the machines were damaged and there was a shortage of workers, but the Japanese were extremely brutal and beat the factory's accountant. They also said that the machines could be repaired, workers could be recruited, and raw materials would be supplied. Otherwise, the factory would be closed and the owner arrested. Therefore, he was forced to manufacture 240 barrels of nails with 250 dan of raw materials and 30,000,000 puppet currency supplied by the Japanese, with no profit. This was forced upon him, not voluntary. Subsequently, the factory's accounting shareholder Jin Lin and worker Zhang Changgou testified in court about the situation at the time. The court debate on the case is pending further investigation and will be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the case of the traitor Zhou Wenxian will continue to be heard at 8:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Major Corruption Case at the Zhabei Police Branch</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Shen Tianbao took the bench in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court to hear a major corruption case involving 17 people. Chen Xuenian, who took office as the director of the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau on September 20 of last year, used his power in October to extort 300,000 from Zhang Lingen and Gong Dechang, the owners who were requesting the return of the land of the Japanese-owned Morita Brewery. Zhang and others then stole 3,000 feet of timber from the factory and sold it to Chen Xuenian, the owner of the Shouqi store at 154 Datong Road, for 6,000,000. Zhang delivered the money to Huang Jianxiong, the chief of the administrative section of the bureau, in several installments, who then transferred it to Chen Xuenian. Later, Chen and Zhang Liancheng, a patrol officer of the bureau, stole 340 steel bars from the Ya Steel Factory during an inspection, and the stolen goods were found at their residences. Subsequently, Zhu Shuyuan, a clerk of the bureau, discovered 550 dozen washbasins in the bureau's square in mid-October last year. Chen Xuenian</p>
<p>forged a document ordering Zhu Shuyuan and two clerks, Fang Xifan, to sell them. Through the introduction of Sha Tangzhou, they were sold to the Ya Jing Dian Porcelain Factory for 166,000,000. On the afternoon of the 17th of the same month, the bureau intercepted 4 tons of coal dust from the 52 Leather Factory that were intended as severance pay for workers. It was discovered that the remaining 16 tons were still in Panjiawan, so Zhang Liancheng ordered the Gonghexin Road Police Station to work with the Judicial Section to confiscate the coal. Later, Section Chief Wang Jianhe sent police officer Shi Xueliang</p>
<p>to transfer the coal, but its whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutor Huang Jianping then charged Chen Xuenian, Huang Jianxiong, and others with receiving bribes, stealing public property, and selling public property. After the defendants' lawyers presented their defenses, the court debated and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 21st. The defendants Chen Xuenian, Huang Jianxiong, Zhu Shuyuan, and Fang Xifan were still remanded in custody and not allowed bail.</p>

<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers Expected to Resume Work This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In the French Concession Water and Electricity Company labor strike, after the company authorities cut off the power yesterday, they also sealed off the diesel pipeline, so public buses could not operate. Therefore, public vehicles in the former French Concession area were suspended all day yesterday, causing great inconvenience to citizens.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Mediation, Opinions Approaching</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, more than a thousand workers from the company gathered in Fuxing Park to discuss countermeasures. At 2:00 PM, six representatives of the union were summoned to the Municipal Party Headquarters to discuss mediation methods with Wang Xianqing and Lu Keming. The company has agreed to issue a bonus of 10,000 to each employee, withhold wages for days of work slowdown, and subsidize 5,000. After Wang and Lu earnestly advised the labor representatives, they expressed their willingness to inform the workers. At 9:00 PM last night, the labor representatives convened a small group meeting to discuss. They have accepted the bonus item, but must require the management to pay the full amount of wages for the days of work slowdown. It was decided to convene a general meeting at the Lujiiawan New Car Factory at 7:30 this morning. If the workers pass the acceptance of the wage subsidy of 5,000 for the days of work slowdown during the general meeting, then work can resume at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>

<p>Tram Driver Suddenly Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Zhao Zhihai, a tram driver for the French Concession Tram Company from Beiping, suddenly returned home and ingested Lysol after the company cut off the power the day before yesterday. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died at around 10:00 PM. According to reporters, Zhao was 48 years old and had worked for the French Concession for six years. He was usually loyal to his work and possessed a strong sense of patriotism. Seeing that the labor strike was prolonged and unresolved, and that the French disregarded everything and cut off the power, making it impossible for the trams to operate, which was bound to cause social unrest, he became disillusioned with life. It is said that Zhao's family was extremely poor, leaving behind an elderly mother, wife, and two young children. The union has decided on a consolation plan.</p>
<h3>American Pilot Who Bombed Tokyo Recounts Torture After Capture Captain Neilson Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Captain Neilson, a member of General Doolittle's command who was world-renowned for bombing Tokyo, hosted Chinese and foreign reporters from this city at 3:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Broadway Mansion to recount his experiences after being captured by the Japanese military following the first bombing of Tokyo on April 18, 1942.</p>
<p>Ran Out of Fuel on the Way Home, Forced to Land</p>
<p>Captain Neilson, 29 years old, arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 13th of this month and plans to participate in the trial of Japanese war criminals who killed three American pilots here. Neilson suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese and will be an important witness at that time.</p>
<p>On April 18, 1942, Neilson and 80 other American pilots, divided into sixteen B-25 aircraft, were ordered to bomb Tokyo. Neilson was on the 16th aircraft and departed from Korea last. On the way back, the aircraft ran out of gasoline and crashed near Ningbo. Neilson, along with pilot Homer and co-pilot Mita, were the only survivors. Three days later, they were captured by the Japanese army and sent to the Japanese gendarmerie for interrogation. In Tokyo, they met several pilots who survived from the 15th aircraft, which also landed due to lack of gasoline.</p>
<p>Imprisoned in Jail, Suffered Greatly</p>
<p>In June of that year, they were transferred to Shanghai and imprisoned in the Bridgehead Building as war criminals. In prison, they were subjected to inhumane treatment. For the first 40 days, they were not allowed to bathe. Later, the Japanese transferred all of them to the Jiangwan Military Prison, but pilot Homer could not go because he was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Japanese held a military trial, but there was no translator and none of them could speak Japanese. On October 15, he saw Homer for the last time and heard that he and two others would be transferred to another concentration camp, after which he heard that they had been killed.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender, Neilson and his group were released in Beiping and rescued by the American rescue team and sent back to their home country. However, in Beiping, he heard the Japanese say that they had bombed Japanese churches, hospitals, and schools, but in fact, this propaganda was purely inconsistent with the facts. They only bombed Japanese arsenals, oil fields, etc. in the northern Tokyo Bay, and never used machine guns.</p>
<p>Lost Approximately Sixty Pounds in Weight</p>
<p>Neilson was imprisoned for a total of 40 months, losing 60 pounds in weight. After returning home, he recuperated and his mother prepared good food for him. Now he has regained 35 pounds. Neilson is still unmarried. Returning to Shanghai this time, he is fortunate to be able to move freely and act, which is very different from the past. He is here to participate in the trial and is determined to reveal all the facts to assist Colonel Heidelin and Captain Tao Ai in their work. Once the task is completed, he plans to return home and recuperate for a while. His fellow sufferer, Sergeant Dieshper, believes that Japan's war of aggression was entirely due to wrong education. The sergeant is now enrolled in a church school and is determined to go to Japan after graduation to improve a part of Japan's education from a church standpoint.</p>
<p>Japanese War Criminals Will Be Tried Soon</p>
<p>A total of seven Japanese are participating in the harm to American pilots this time, including two lieutenant generals, one colonel, and four captains. Currently, one captain is in Nanjing, one is in Singapore, and four are in Japan. Only one captain is in Shanghai, who is the one who executed the American pilots. As for the date of the trial, it will be held within the next two weeks.</p>

<h3>Incident at the Southern Theater in Nanshi Last Night; Three Soldiers Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 9 PM last night, a conflict occurred at the Southern Theater on the west side of the Penglai Market in Nanshi due to a dispute over smoking. The incident escalated into a shootout. As a result, soldiers Shao Ganpan and Xu Zhirong sustained gunshot wounds. In addition, Liu Shoumin, a traffic post soldier stationed near Xiaoximen, rushed to the scene upon hearing the commotion. However, after taking only a few steps, a soldier snatched his handgun and fired two shots, wounding Liu and causing him to fall to the ground. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. The bullet hit his abdomen, and his life is in critical condition. The details are currently being investigated by the relevant authorities.</p>

The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has received orders to notify them.</p>
<h3>Property Tax Investigation and Valuation to Be Completed in Over a Year</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This reporter has learned from the Finance Bureau that the collection of property taxes is based on the decision of the Housing Rental Management Committee. The valuation of ordinary residences is calculated at forty times the pre-war value. For productive properties such as apartments, hotels, and shops, the valuation is calculated at sixty times the pre-war value. A 14% tax is then levied on this valuation, with the landlord and tenant each bearing half of the burden. For rent collected this year, those with existing records will be taxed based on this increased valuation. However, for properties with lost records, staff must be dispatched to investigate and value them individually. The city is vast, with a total of 200,000 households. The investigation will take considerable time. Currently, only the areas of West Shanghai, the city center, and Ma Dang have completed the valuation and started collection. Although the valuation in other areas may be delayed, once the valuation is completed, taxes will be levied retroactively from the winter of last year. When asked when the entire valuation would be completed, the response was that it would likely take more than a year.</p>
<p>Land Registration Extended by Two Months</p>
<p>The Land Administration Bureau's handling of citywide land registration, originally scheduled for two months, has expired. To facilitate unregistered property owners, the bureau has decided to extend the deadline for another two months. Currently, an average of 500 people per district are registering in the three districts where registration has begun. To date, the registered land has reached 30% of the bureau's planned target.</p>

<h3>Pillars of the New China: The Youth Army Arrives in Shanghai, Regretting They Could Not Kill the Enemy with Their Own Hands</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Suren</p>
<p>"If it were possible, I would really like to join your ranks," I said, shaking the strong hand of a Youth Army sergeant at parting. Our eyes met, and our hearts communicated. The scene: "The setting sun shines on the great flag, the horses neigh and the wind whistles." But this is not a time for soldiers to leave for the frontier, but a time for heroes to triumphantly return. The surging tide of the Huangpu River plays a welcoming song. On the deck of the "Hongda" ship, crowded with heroes wearing "Lion" armbands, are the pillars of the new China and the foundation of world peace. The national flag flutters on the mast, reflecting the setting sun, a scene of solemnity, magnificence, making one dare not look directly.</p>
<p>One Hundred Thousand Soldiers</p>
<p>I first went to Jiangwan Fudan University, the location of the 207th Division Headquarters of the Youth Expeditionary Force. Division Commander Luo Youlun was away on official business, and Education Director Liu Shaofeng, suffering from a cold, got out of bed to greet me. General Liu, a graduate of the seventh class of the military academy, had worked as a newspaper editor. He was short and wiry, but extremely amiable and approachable, and well-suited to be the director of a large group of young students. He narrated the whole story of the Youth Army, how they called on educated youth to join the army for the planned general counter-offensive, and how they began training in Kunming a year later. The two hundred first to two hundred ninth divisions, a hundred thousand strong, were just about to swear an oath and set out when Japan surrendered. He said that this was an irreparable regret. From the division commanders to every soldier, they all regretted not being able to kill the enemy with their own hands. But on the other hand, we should also be glad for the country, that it retained the elite of this army, preserving a greater share of the nation's vitality.</p>
<p>The entire division of over ten thousand men departed from Kunming on October 15 of last year. They traveled by road to Hankou, and then boarded ships to Shanghai. They spent many days in Hankou, and their footprints were left on the Han River and Dongting Lake. Hundreds of camps were lined up along the river. Several days ago, they were ordered to come to take over defense duties, and they began to hurry. So now there are two kinds of troops in the division headquarters. The Twenty-second Division of the New Sixth Army will not be able to fully depart until tomorrow morning. A regiment of the Youth Army arrived the day before yesterday, and another regiment arrived today. The newly arrived regiment can only be accommodated on the ship for one more night. The bright moon on the river may be more beautiful. Please, warriors, enjoy it.</p>
<p>Strict Discipline</p>
<p>Previously, some people had doubts about the discipline of students joining the army. Later, the actual performance was better day by day. At first, they may have had some young master habits, but now they do everything themselves. At first glance, you would think they were ordinary soldiers. You have to look carefully to feel that each one has the air of a scholar. Then you cannot help but be surprised by their arduous and extraordinary efforts.</p>
<p>After taking a few photos on the square, General Liu invited me to inspect the newly arrived troops at the dock. There, I met General Pang Zongyi, the commander of the 620th Regiment. General Pang was very imposing, but equally kind to people. After discussing it, they ordered all the soldiers not to go ashore, but to stay on the ship for another night. This work was quickly completed.</p>
<p>Full of Vigor</p>
<p>I stood on the deck watching them walk, talk, and transport things, and everyone was full of vigor. Look: The new China is beginning to grow. Who says that the quality of our army is low? Aren't these Youth Army soldiers better than average? May the country quickly move towards peace and unity, and in the future, all the troops will reach the same level. And may Shanghai be fortunate to have the protection of this army. All citizens will change their attitude towards soldiers, and educated youth will recognize the glory of joining the army. After they complete their officer training in a year, another group of young people will take over and lead them. At that time, the building of the army will be successful, and the safety of the country and the peace of the world will have a definite guarantee.</p>
<p>May the Youth Expeditionary Force improve day by day, and continue to be a model for the national army.</p>

<h3>Organizing Joke Material</h3>
<p>— Wang Huanbai</p>
<p>There are many things that, although we look at them and feel they are not worth paying attention to, are actually the opposite. We should not ignore them. I believe that a person who takes a negligent attitude towards small things has little possibility of succeeding in great undertakings, so focusing on all kinds of trivial matters is not superfluous. The opinion I want to propose now—organizing joke material—is meant to do just that.</p>
<p>People have a motive for amusement, and laughter is a kind of action belonging to this motive. When people are happy, they cannot help but smile, which is the satisfaction of the amusement motive. We know that a person who spends the whole year with a stern face is painful to himself, even though others see him as serious. Only being able to laugh every day is the most meaningful thing in life. Therefore, someone's suggestion that one must laugh three times a day is truly a wise saying.</p>
<p>Since we already know that laughter has such a great effect on life, then why not seize the source of laughter, so that we can get laughing material anytime, anywhere? — Smart people have long thought of a way, which is to collect funny facts and then contribute them to others. In Hollywood, the American film capital, there is a library that specializes in collecting jokes, containing millions of joke books for people to read. In the American movies we see in Shanghai, there are often many interesting interjections that make people laugh. These materials are certainly not thought of by a few screenwriters and directors. Most of them can be said to come from that library.</p>
<p>There are many jokes that have been passed down from ancient China to today, but some of them are considered inferior and some contain allusions, so everyone looks down on them. Now, however, we welcome Western things. In fact, there is no lack of excellent content in Chinese jokes. Good ones can be said to be many, many. Why not compile them, print them out, and make them public?</p>
<p>Organizing joke material is a work that is beneficial to society at present. If there is an enthusiastic person willing to take on the task, they may as well first search for all the jokes, and then select those that are meaningful and interesting, and spend a little effort to revise them. I think it won't be too difficult.</p>

<h3>Effective Nursery Rhymes</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Speaking of nursery rhymes, they seem to have been around for a long time, and many are recorded in history books. We are not doing archeology, so we don't need to rehash old things. However, since the Republic of China, there have been several nursery rhymes that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1926, Xia Chao was the Governor of Zhejiang Province. He was originally the Chief of the Provincial Capital Police Department. Sun Chuanfang drove out Lu Yongxiang and took over as the Governor, and Xia Chao was promoted as a result. At that time, there was a nursery rhyme: "The  returns, Xia Chao loses his head." In 1927, Sun Chuanfang became the Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Army and sat in Nanjing. The Northern Expeditionary Army rose up and fought a major battle in Nanchang, and the Governor of Zhejiang was given to Lu Xiangting. In order to respond to the Northern Expedition, Xia Chao rejected the Allied Army in Jiaxing. Unfortunately, the arrangements were not complete, and he retreated to Hangzhou. Later, he was arrested and killed by Lu Xiangting. This  was not Lu Yongxiang, but Lu Xiangting. The nursery rhyme actually came true again. At that time, among the warlords, Wu Peifu was the most stubborn, and there was an early nursery rhyme popular among the people of Jiangnan: "One two three four five, overthrow Wu Peifu, six seven eight nine ten, welcome  Chiang Kai-shek." Sure enough, his prestige reached far and wide, and the warlords succumbed to his power. The nursery rhyme came true again. During the September 18th Incident, the Japanese invaders regarded our Northeast region as their lifeline and dared to invade and drive their troops straight in, and the Northeast fell as a result. However, the hearts of the people did not die, and there was a nursery rhyme at the time: "Talking about the Japanese, talking about the Japanese, the Japanese devils will not last long." After forcibly occupying it for fourteen years, they finally surrendered and returned the Northeast to us. The nursery rhyme became a reality. On August 13th, the Japanese invaders invaded and dreamed of annexing our country, wanting to regard themselves as the masters of the Greater East Asia, envying the Axis powers and igniting the Second World War. There was another nursery rhyme that circulated: "Overthrow the Japanese, kill the foreigners." There were even rumors that children who sang this nursery rhyme were brutally killed by the Japanese invaders by having water poured into them and their stomachs cut open, and their parents died with them. The nursery rhyme still came true. The Japanese invaders were indeed overthrown, and many foreigners died in the war and Nazi massacres. Recently, there is another nursery rhyme that is being circulated: "The Japanese are dead, Sun Yat-sen is alive again." What does this mean? It is thought that the first line has already come true, and the interpretation of the second line can be said to be the realization of the Prime Minister's legacy and the completion of the great cause of national construction. So, although the Prime Minister is dead, he is still alive, equal to being alive again.</p>
<p>In fact, the popularity and effectiveness of nursery rhymes is based on the psychology of the masses, not superstition. Because people have the same heart, whatever the heart thinks, it is spread by word of mouth, and everyone sings it with understanding, and everyone promotes its realization, so how can it not come true!</p>

<h3>I Teach University Students</h3>
<p>— Shen Yi</p>
<p>Today, a recent university graduate came to our bank. It is said that he studied in the "Mechanical Engineering Department" of a certain famous university. I was shocked to hear this. For such a qualified, skilled, and university-trained professional to take on the work of a bank clerk, which only requires ordinary knowledge, it is too much of a waste of the knowledge he has gained from sixteen years of hard study, and it is also too much of a burial of his true talents that are needed by the country and can be fully applied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is up to me, a junior employee who is not qualified to be a formal middle school student, to teach a university student about the receipt and payment and registration of various cash accounts. It seems a bit too much to elevate my status.</p>
<p>But I cannot disobey the orders of my superiors, so I can only temporarily "honorably" carry out this mission. What is strange is that this mission does not make me feel the slightest bit of pride. On the contrary, I have endless sympathy and admiration for his actions. We did not talk about any private matters except for official business. I saw his melancholy and silent face, as if it contained infinite inner pain, so just as my question was about to jump out of my throat, it was swallowed back by saliva. He carefully, cautiously, patiently, and diligently learned the various accounts that I taught him. This kind of spirit of re-learning made me feel a kind of inexplicable suffocation tormenting me.</p>
<p>When office hours were over, he packed up his things on his desk, politely said "See you tomorrow" to me, and left. I watched his back in a long cloth gown and felt lost.</p>
<p>From a colleague, I learned that his family is now in great difficulty. His father died last year, and his university course was completed with the help of several relatives. After graduating from university, I heard that he had also applied to a famous mechanical engineering plant, but because there were too many applicants and he did not have strong connections or guarantees, his true skills did not allow him to find a real place to work. So this time, he was introduced to our bank by a relative.</p>
<p>After listening to this, I deeply felt that in today's society, qualifications and talents are indeed a part of finding a job, but what is most needed are connections and introductions that are more useful than qualifications and talents. I feel sorry for this university student who "does not use what he has learned," but there are more university students who are wandering on the unemployment and starvation line after graduation. I want to shout: "Save the university students!"</p>

<h3>The Game of Life</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>Regard your life as a mischievous child participating in a very interesting game.</p>
<p>The rules of any game must be diligently learned and often practiced. Especially the game of life.</p>
<p>In the game, enthusiasm is needed to win. So life must have great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Your attitude toward work is very important. Are you doing hard labor and hating your work? Or are you making work as lovable as a game?</p>
<p>A life of enjoyment or a life of drudgery, both are chosen by yourself.</p>
<p>Making yourself feel happy about work and life is as easy as making yourself hate them.</p>

<h3>Madison Square Garden in New York</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiali</p>
<p>Located on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets in New York City is one of the world's most famous sports arenas: Madison Square Garden. The Garden celebrated its 20th anniversary of moving to midtown Manhattan in December of last year. One reason why this arena is so famous around the world is that outstanding athletic figures from all industries have showcased their skills there. For example, world skating queen Sonja Henie began her professional skating career in the Garden. World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis held his title in the Garden five times. World-renowned long-distance runners, Finland's Nurmi, America's Cunningham, and Sweden's Hägg, have all competed on the Garden's 160-yard wooden track. Les Sett also demonstrated his invincible basketball skills in the Garden. Rogue Eddie had a brawl at the Garden during a lacrosse game. There are also those circus aerialists who perform acrobatics in the air, who have died on the spot due to carelessness while performing in the Garden.</p>
<p>Every year, many sports champions or championship teams are willing to perform in this fire-protected arena: such as the National Amateur Athletic Union's indoor track and field competition, the National Basketball Association's joint competition, the National Horse Show, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and the World Livestock Championship.</p>
<p>The boxing championships hosted by boxing promoter Jacobs have always been held at Madison Square Garden. Hollywood's skating competitions are held there every winter. The National Lacrosse Championship is performed in the Garden's skating rink. Several famous circuses perform there every spring for a month.</p>
<p>All tourists visiting New York are amazed that the Garden occupies 30 city blocks. The Garden is northwest of Madison Square.</p>
<p>The Garden began its history in 1857, when the first Federal Station was built near Madison Square Garden. In 1871, the railway authorities abandoned the location as the end of the railway, and the Federal Station was converted into an exhibition hall, named Gilmore's Garden, then renamed Barnum's Circus, and finally renamed Madison Square Garden in 1897. In 1890, a new house was built on that site.</p>
<p>At that time, Madison Square Garden was north of New York's entertainment center. The Garden's directors included banking tycoon Morgan and Barnum. Its architect, White, was shot and killed in his roof garden in 1906 by Shaw Harry. In 1896, Bryan accepted the Democratic National Convention's nomination as a presidential candidate in the Garden. At the 29th meeting of the People's Life Party's National Congress in 1924, the late U.S. President Roosevelt suddenly withdrew from the election and gave his votes to his old friend Smith, also there. It was the unprecedented and outstanding businessman Rickard who moved the Garden to its current address.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Powerful X-Rays</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyao</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, the American General Electric Company created a massive X-ray machine called a "Betatron." The X-rays emitted by this machine were extremely powerful and dangerous. For safety, a three-foot-thick concrete wall was built around the machine. During the war, it was kept secret. It was not until mid-October of last year that the authorities slightly revealed some general information about the machine.</p>
<p>The "Betatron" is an electron accelerator, like a common AC transformer. Two coils made of one-inch thick copper bars surround a 130-ton electromagnet. A large amount of current passes through, making a buzzing sound.</p>
<p>Between the poles of the electromagnet, a bracelet-shaped glass vacuum tube with a diameter of 74 inches is placed. Inside the tube is a hot filament that emits electrons. The high voltage formed between the two poles of the electromagnet causes the electrons to circulate in a perfect circular orbit inside the tube. In one two-hundred-and-fortieth of a second, it rotates 250,000 times, which, measured in electrical units, is equal to 100 million volts.</p>
<p>After this, the current in the electromagnetic coil gradually decreases, and another magnet pulls the electrons out of the circular orbit. The electrons then spiral inward and strike a heavy target. X-rays are emitted from this.</p>
<p>These X-rays can penetrate thick steel plates, as if the steel were made of ice. It can also do other tricks. For example, a silver dollar, when slightly irradiated by it, becomes a very dangerous radioactive material. The X-rays knock neutrons out of the silver atoms. Some of the silver turns into [element missing], and another part turns into [element missing]. And the copper in the silver dollar turns into [element missing] atoms.</p>
<p>The controller for the "Betatron" is installed in another room.</p>

<h3>Abolish Recommendation Letters</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>In our country of morality, the effectiveness of recommendation letters is many times greater than lengthy resumes.</p>
<p>Moreover, recommendation letters not only affect the difficult first step of entering, but, to put it bluntly, will affect the end of continuous service in this organization. Despite performance evaluations and attendance records, those with strong backing always occupy an absolute advantage everywhere.</p>
<p>Victory has been five months ago now. The unreasonable phenomena that may have existed in the early days of victory should also be thoroughly reviewed, and the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have them, and striving harder if we don't" should be adopted to achieve perfection. The practice of using only recommendation letters as the standard for appointing personnel should also be seriously investigated.</p>
<p>Those with recommendation letters ascend to high positions smoothly and happily, while those without them can only sigh and complain. Disregarding talent and only asking for recommendation letters is truly the most unfair thing in the world.</p>
<p>Abolish recommendation letter lobbying! Stop using official titles as rewards! Isn't it a pity not to use the examination system? Looking around, everything is waiting to be rebuilt, and looking far away, talent is scarce. In such a situation, if we don't thoroughly implement examinations and reward and promote talent, but only use recommendation letters as the standard, the obstruction to reconstruction work is self-evident.</p>

<h3>A Child's Revelation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chengjun</p>
<p>My seriously ill uncle finally passed away at 1:05 PM due to physical weakness and the ineffectiveness of medicine.</p>
<p>Because I was tired from a day's work, I visited him one last time in the evening. Seeing that his expression didn't seem to indicate imminent death, and my aunt also advised me to rest early so that I wouldn't be without energy at the office tomorrow, I returned to my room to sleep.</p>
<p>At midnight, the clock struck heavily, as if sending a signal urging my uncle to leave the world. A mouthful of phlegm welled up in his throat, blocking it. With a choking sound, he finally quietly departed from this world.</p>
<p>My aunt's cries woke me up.</p>
<p>My uncle was lying stiffly on the bed, never to open his eyes again to see everything around him, including his dearest wife and Chao'er. But Chao'er was woken up by his mother's cries and jumped up.</p>
<p>Chao'er is only six years old this year, and my uncle loved him the most. Since he was weaned, he had always slept with his father, not leaving him for a single night. Since my uncle fell ill two months ago, my aunt had moved Chao'er to sleep on another cot. But he often cried and clamored to sleep with his father.</p>
<p>"Daddy is sleeping. If you wake him up, he won't like you." Whenever Chao'er made a fuss, my aunt would coax him like this, and he seemed to understand this meaning. To win his father's favor, he would immediately stop his fuss.</p>
<p>Now, in the middle of the night, his own mother was crying and making noise. In Chao'er's eyes, this not only hindered his sweet sleep but also disturbed his beloved father's peaceful rest.</p>
<p>"Mommy, you always tell me not to wake Daddy when he's sleeping. Now that Daddy is sleeping so soundly, why are you crying and disturbing him, even waking me up?" Chao'er said in an innocent tone, while looking at his mother, fully expecting to receive his mother's praise and a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>But the opposite was true. My aunt didn't even glance at him, but just sobbed.</p>
<p>Standing beside them, I was left between tears and laughter by Chao'er's expression. I received a valuable revelation: "Death is simply a long, deep sleep, what's so rare and sad about it?"</p>
<p>Although life and death are two extremes, they are so close. A person goes from infancy, childhood, youth, adulthood to old age, and then to death, as fleeting as the morning dew. If we view a father's death as a deep sleep, like Chao'er does, then what terror and sorrow do we have for death?</p>

<h3>Raising Education Loans: Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>Displaying Rare and Valuable Ancient Paintings</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee will hold a charity sale exhibition of calligraphy and paintings at the China Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road for a week starting from the 23rd of this month to raise funds. The exhibition will display about 500 recent works by modern famous calligraphers and painters. Using a lottery method, one can obtain a masterpiece by a famous artist. The method is to first purchase a charity sale ticket, each ticket costing 5,000 yuan. Two days before the closing, tickets are used to draw numbers and claim the corresponding artwork. It is said that more than fifty Shanghai calligraphers and painters enthusiastically support this initiative, and their works are all carefully crafted masterpieces. Each piece is usually priced at over 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, but to spread good fortune, they are sold for only 5,000 yuan. Therefore, all charity sale tickets have been snapped up by people from all walks of life. A small number remains and is sold on behalf of the committee by the Social Services Department of this newspaper. Readers are requested to come and purchase them within four days, as the opportunity is rare and may be too late if delayed. In addition, the committee has recently received sponsorship from a collector in Shanghai, who has provided about 30 ancient paintings from various dynasties for display and exhibition. These are exceptionally precious and rarely seen. They will also be sold at marked prices, with the proceeds going to help students. When the time comes, the China Painting Gallery will surely be packed with people, and the grand occasion can be predicted.</p>
