<p>〔本報北平一日電〕國軍進入承德後，現正向外圍擴張，南下某部已抵灤平，不久或可與平古綫國軍會師於古北口。古北口至承德間，現尚有小部共軍，但似無阻止國軍打通平承綫可能，承德共軍撤向閘塲，惟大部尚在豐寗附近。又訊，平北國軍進展，今日已進駐大小湯山九里山一帶。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽一日電〕冀東一帶共軍，為策應熱河戰事，企圖大舉　動，破壞鐵路，國軍為維護交通，已開始行動。如冀熱國軍在古北口會合，則冀東共軍，入於大包圍之形勢中。</p>
<p>〔本報天津一日電〕北寗路蘆台漢沽間之小莊，於卅一日下午四時，被共軍四百餘攻擊，守軍迎戰，迄下午五時將其擊退。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京一日電〕國軍今日發動大反擊，對平津山海關一帶長方形區域內之共軍，作廣大包圍，此舉目的在解除共軍對平瀋間鐵路綫之威脅。自軍事觀點言，此舉極為需要，因該路係關內與東北之惟一交通綫。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京一日電〕據悉：熱河方面國軍正加緊推進，鄭洞國將軍親蒞前綫指揮國軍之進取赤峯，國軍似擬突破赤峯以南共軍之外圍防綫，預料該城不久可下。又向張家口推進之國軍第二軍，已在昌平以北與共軍接觸。又傳北平近郊有局部衝突。市內可開槍砲聲。</p>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕大同失守消息，已證實絕對不確，今日馬占山將軍尚接大同守軍來電稱，除沙嶺周家村馬君營三據點，楚溪春部因眾寡不敵，業已放棄外，東部南部曹福樓北岩廟警官學校三據點尚在楚部固守中。馬部所守為大同北部西部車站一帶。卅日下午八時半共軍八百餘人，向車站第五師陣地猛攻，企圖破壞水塔，終被守軍擊退，夜十一時共軍向公司礦務局等據點猛烈攻擊，亦被守軍擊退。卅一日晨共軍集結殘部再犯，經痛擊已向自馬屯臥虎溝天主教堂方面退去，此役斃共軍二百餘名。據馬將軍公館稱，大同飛機塲，並無業已陷落之報告。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原卅一日電〕幷長官部發言人，三十一日對印度馬德里廣播電台廣播中共宣佈攻佔大同一事，發表聲明稱，截至三十一日下午七時為止，大同周圍戰事，南方在飛機塲南側北　廟前，北方在車站以北，東方在御河以東，西方在西關以外各地區接戰，並未進至城周。</p>
<p>蘇北共軍攻勢受挫　如臯情勢漸趨穩定</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣一日電〕據泰興前綫訊：（一）如皐方面共軍，攻勢已稍殺，情勢漸趨穩定。（二）犯黃橋共軍，已進入該鎮南郊，刻激戰中，據某軍事家語記者，泰興大戰將第二次展開。（三）海安受共軍重圍，由昨午前迄今晨止，激戰一晝夜，情勢嚴重。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣一日電〕李司令官默庵，王主席　功昨聯袂赴泰興視察，有所指示。</p>
<p>〔本報靖江一日電〕黃橋卅一日夜十二時，被共軍攻陷。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰一日電〕靖江外圍，日來又趨緊張，共軍企圖破壞八圲港至靖城公路交通，晝伏夜動，時有小接觸發生。</p>
<h3 id="c2">會晤駱基將軍事畢　廿五小組昨返平　今訪孫連仲明日赴張垣 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕記者昨隨調查安平事件之軍調部第二十五小組赴安平，當日抵津，因天晚，小組改於一日晨十時拜訪美陸戰隊司令駱基將軍，請其就安平事件提供意見並資料，下午歸來。駱基於相當愉快下，接待小組人員，並由共方代表黃逸峯以主席資格（小組主席三方輪流），說明來意，希駱基以美方當事人正式表示意見，政府代表張叔衡以政府立塲，表示政府未對此等事件防之於先，事後又遲遲未得合理解決，特誌歉意。</p>
<p>駱基當塲談話要點：（一）共軍為有準備的，（二）勿因此影響雙方感情，（三）此後仍抱彼不犯我，我不犯人態度，（四）同行無國軍，（五）事前共軍是否常駐安平不詳。渠首稱：渠已記錄親自參與該事件者及團營負責人之報告，繼稱：其陸戰隊經過平津公路，完全為向北平輸送給養，「七二九」安平事件發生日，陸戰隊武裝之加強，鑒於過去曾數次蒙受射擊而作準備，平日皆為一長官帶兵二十五人，故是日臨時增為四十人（但車夫與隨行者不在內），其用意在保護安全，預防匪賊，而未料竟遇共軍之「有預備的行動」。事故發生後，據報告，外問頗有反感，希望不因此事影響對共產黨之感情。繼稱：余（駱基自稱）始終竭盡力量，使美兵勿與共軍發生問題。</p>
<p>繼之張叔衡問，駱基答：問，有人說是次有國軍同行，是否屬實。答，所有報告，均調無國軍同行，余為避免此種流弊，且特別令美兵不與國軍同駐一地。問，據云同行者有行總車輛，不悉其如何加入美軍車輛行列？答，不詳，恐係為了安全。問有人說行總車內為國軍軍火？答。余測度恐無此事。</p>
<p>以下為黃逸峯與駱基問答，問，將軍知道平津公路上有共產黨部隊否？答，余僅知平津公路為國軍所保護，但亦知有共產黨軍隊，惟不詳其為流動的抑常駐的。問，與冀省共軍有聯絡否？答，前有美兵二人受射傷，來一人謂係共產黨所派來道歉，並希常聯絡，但後因事尋彼，即未尋到。問，該次車輛曾掛美國旗否？答，不詳。駱基並稱：彼曾訓令部下，除受射擊而可開槍自衛外，絕禁先攻擊人，但為守橋樑，對越入禁地者之開槍，不在此限。又談論終了後，共產黨代表曾請求單獨與駱基談話二十分鍾，該小組定二日訪問孫連仲，三日，飛張家口，訪問聶榮臻。</p>
<h3 id="c3">周恩來昨午抵滬　當日招待中外各報記者　說明對改組政府之態度 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕周恩來於今日晨九時專機飛滬，聞對共黨在滬宣傳及內部工作，有所指示，並將在滬參加記者招待會，</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中共代表周恩來，昨日上午十一時，由京乘機飛抵滬，下午四時卅分，在馬斯南路一〇七號招待中外各報社記者，報告中共對于改組政府之態度。渠稱：「在五人小組非正式會談前，必須弄親前提，即共產黨仍堅持，政府必須保證，改組政府後，能立即停戰，及政府必須撤回五項要求，談判始能繼續」。周並表示，此兩點如不能獲得解決，則前途仍極悲觀。且稱：中共方面此次接受司徒雷登大使建議，參加五人會談，也祇是「試一試」而已。此外對于美國政府讓售剩餘物資事，幷加以抨擊，謂係違背杜魯門去年十二月聲明，及莫斯科三國公約之舉措。旋答覆各記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>問：對蔡文治將軍昨日發表之談話，中央有何意見？</p>
<p>答：我想執行部中央代表也許要有答覆。</p>
<p>問：司徒雷登大使建議之五人會談，聞祇商討改組政府問題，不涉及其他，何以中共方面又先提出兩項要求？</p>
<p>答：司徒大使希望從此次會談中，立即實現和平，故建議在五人小組開會時，不談其他問題，但這不是中共的態度。</p>
<p>問：五人小組是否將為最後一次商談，中共態度如何？</p>
<p>答：中共認為假如政府在此次會談中，不改變態度，恐怕難有結果，至是否將為最後一次商談，當取決於人民的意見。</p>
<p>問：這次會談周先生出席否？</p>
<p>答：我現在尚未考慮。</p>
<p>問：政協綜合小組何時召開？</p>
<p>答：假如五人會議時，能即停戰，並能照政協決議改組政府，就要召開綜合小組作最後決定。</p>
<p>問：五人會議結果，是否能代表各黨派之意見？</p>
<p>答：這是非正式會談，不能代表各黨派意見，將來還要召開政協綜合小組，再作商討。</p>
<p>問：會談如無結果前途如何？</p>
<p>答：前途很悲慘，不可想象。</p>
<p>問：會談如無結果，中共與政府是否仍將保持接觸？</p>
<p>答：我們的信心，認為和平還有希望，因為全國人民都要和平，這是不可抗的力量。</p>
<p>問：五人會談何日召開？</p>
<p>答：據今日晚報載，將在本月三日召開。</p>
<p>問：美國讓售中國之剩餘物資，何以認其具有戰鬥性質？</p>
<p>答：從間接直接方面都可證明</p>
<p>問：周先生對目前國際現勢，作何觀測？</p>
<p>答：我對國際問題，最近並無研究，但我認為任何一個國家決不敢掀動第三次大戰。</p>
<p>問：報載中共擴充空軍訓練飛行人員，是否屬實？</p>
<p>答：我祇知道「北滿」有幾架日本破飛機，至訓練空軍一事，尚未有所聞。</p>
<p>問：承德是否已由國軍進入？</p>
<p>答：承德情況，報上如此說。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺一日電〕靑年團二屆全國代表大會，一日上午九時開幕，蔣主席以兼團長身份，親臨主持，並致詞，對今後團務發展指示六項方針。今日會議中出席各靑年代表皆有寶貴意見貢獻，團長甚表欣慰。十一時四十五分舉行預備會議，通過議事日程議事規則，並選舉大會正副秘書長及大會主席團，下午大會休會，各代表分組討論，二日晨八時將舉行正式會議。</p>
<p>蔣兼團長之開幕詞要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）本團成立目的，在團結全國靑年，（集中國民革命新的力量，以求得抗戰建國的成功，與三民主義的具體實現）。在第一次全國代表大會時，我曾指示我們要喚醒全國靑年，號召全國，積極團結，奮發黽勉，為抗戰求勝利，為同胞謀幸福，為國家求獨立，以完成我們革命建國的使命。自第一次代表大會在現在，已經三年，賴我中央及各地同志的努力奮勇，對於神聖抗戰，實在有很大的貢獻，可以說爭取抗戰勝利的使命，業已達成，現在的要點，在加緊建國，以保全抗戰勝利的成果。</p>
<p>（二）上次代表大會時，抗戰正極劇烈，前途日見光明，那年正月平等新約的訂立，使中國開啓了獨立自由的新機運，而我們中國正在與盟邦並肩作戰，分担了遠東戰塲的重要任務，國際上對我國認為四強之一，當時情形實在令人興奮，在這次代表大會開會時，勝利已達一年，但是復員工作，遭受種種障碍而尚未完成，政府切求和平統一安定的希望，也遇到不少的困難，而至今未能實現。現政治的糾紛，社會的紊亂，農工生產之凋敝，刧後人民的痛苦，道德精神的墮落，民族自尊心的消失，較之抗戰時期，均不可同日而語。我曾說：「戰後復興與建設，其艱鉅將十倍於戰時」。這一個艱難的克服，是我們每一個國民的責任，尤其是我們每一中國靑年無可旁貸的責任。</p>
<p>（三）這次大會的性質和任務，是要澈底檢討三年以來，整個團務進行的得失利弊，發現那些部份有成績，那些部分成績不夠，發現那些我們的困難，對於這些困難，有沒有力來克服，更要坦白熱烈的反省我們的缺點，揭發我們的缺點，研究改正缺點的具體辦法。乘此集合一堂的機會，要互相交換工作的經騐，勵行自我批評和相互批評，以期集思廣益，策進我們團務今後的開展。</p>
<p>（四）一年來國際形勢，與國內政治的變遷，從倫敦五外長會議，至最近的巴黎和會，中間經過了不少的演變，我們中國不論是否參加，都一秉維護人類正義，實現世界和平的方針而努力，尤其是這次巴黎和會，是今後世界安危治亂的關鍵所繫，我們希望世界永久和平的計劃，終能實現，聯合國的組織漸臻健全。我們中國一定要本着抗戰的初衷，為國際的正義與和平而努力。我們應自覺我國對國際關係的重要，務必自信為有安定力量，以不負一切友邦的希望，至於內政，各位身經目擊，不待我多所敘述，就現狀來說，固然有待改進之處甚多，但與十年前作一比較，則進步之處亦不少。戰前東北被日人所佔，華北若干省亦為日本勢力所侵擾，西南各省之情形，也相當特殊，現在除若干特殊區域外，中央政令已可完全生效，這便是國家統一的基礎，是一個很大的進步。</p>
<p>（五）綜觀內外形勢，只要我們能自強自立，必可完成總理的遺志。當前最緊要的是：（一）完全統一，（二）加緊建國。我們應該反省我們的本身，加緊我們在積極方面的努力，使三民主義完全實現。我們要改革我們在政治上的缺點，要愛護民眾，扶助多數民眾的利益，要本着總理節制資本的遺教，來解決經濟問題，要本着平均地權的遺教，來處理土地問題，達到耕者有其田的目的。凡是總理的信徒，不論團體或個人，都要以堂堂正正光明坦白的精神，恪守法紀，尊重自由，推進自治，培養民權，以樹立民主憲政的基礎。</p>
<p>（六）靑年是國家繼起的生命，本團是為了團結全國靑年，共負革命建國大業而組織的，今後如何提高我們靑年的信心，如何解除我們靑年的煩悶與痛苦，如何確立我們靑年報國有效的途徑，如何增進我們靑年在學問智識技能與事業上的修養，真正能使我中國靑年努力於革命建國，這是本屆大會所要精心討論的一個主題。最主要的，我們必須保持我們民族堅貞不拔的固有道德，發揚我們民族悠久博大的固有文化，重禮義，知廉恥，能忍勞忍苦，能積極向上，在頹廢紊亂，祇講利害不講是非的滔滔橫流之中，砥礪我們頂天立地的志節，樹立我們一般靑年自重自愛的人格。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕我國最新組成之民治黨，昨日下午在康樂酒樓舉行第一次記者招待會，到該黨常務委員司徒美堂·朱家兆·趙昱等，首由司徒美堂致辭，略謂：該黨原為一有歷史·有組織·有力量之社會，會員遍海內外，黨員估計當在三百萬以上，現正辦理登記中。該黨對政府及各黨各派抱友好態度，盼能一秉至公，切實合作，以期對國家民族有所貢獻，而促使中國走上眞正民主之大道。嗣趙昱起立稱：七十年前，華僑人數甚少，後以洪門起義失敗，志士遍跡海外者甚多，遂建良好之革命基礎。辛亥革命，華僑盡甚大，抗戰期間，海外僑胞盡力亦多，今値抗戰勝得，願以純粹愛國熱心，參加國內政治，面以努力生產建設為目標。朱家兆繼稱：留美僑胞，已有八十年歷史，而洪門機關在美者亦有三百餘，同志十餘萬人，南洋一帶機關亦達五百餘，同志二百五十餘萬，素為國家民族着想，竭盡人力物力，貢獻革命工作，故國父會稱：華僑為「革命之母」，而華僑功成身退，未與政治。去年三月，致公堂華僑，在美成立致公黨，本擬早日派遣代表回國組黨，因交通阻塞，未能實現。此次勝利後，復回祖國，經數月來之籌備，組黨工作終吿成功，惟黨名則已由致公黨改為民治黨，其目的則在聯合海內外同志，注重經濟建設，創立新中國。旋由該黨張書城宣讓對時局主張五點：（一）國內軍事衝突，應即停止，在和平統一原則之下，從速解決一切政治軍事問題。（二）造成改組政府，惟各黨派應努力於切實革新政治，不應斤斤於名額分配問題，延阻和平實現，加重國家危難。（三）軍隊整編，應由重國家危難。（三）軍隊整編，應由各黨派推選代表組織整編委員會，依照整軍方案，切實執行，以期達到軍隊國家化之目的。（四）爭執地區，可劃分為若干「新政實騐區」，由政府選派無武力之政黨人士，合組委員會，暫行負責治理，憲法布後，此項臨時治理權，仍應移交於民選之地方政府，（五）任何黨派，應保持國家領土主權完整，該黨反對將任何內爭問題，提交聯合國討論，或要求國際間作直接或間接之十預。</p>

<p>民治黨係海外僑胞各洪門團體所組織，經於本年八月在滬舉行第一次代表大會，決定政綱，通過總章宣言，并選舉總部負責人，宣吿成立。直到昨天在滬招待記者，始通電全國，正式公開。這是値得注意的一個政治結社。</p>
<p>表面上似乎這是一個新政黨，其實是一個舊組織，正如他們宣言內所稱「周雖舊邦，其命維新」，換一句西洋話，這叫作「舊瓶裝新酒」。這個結合應是富有歷史上的革命性與民族性的。洪門是一個革命團體，志在恢復中華，有熱有血有光，在上寫下了光芒的詩篇，每當時代考騐人們靈魂的時候，他們曾經數度拯救了他們的祖國。</p>
<p>這黨的發起人趙昱·朱家兆·司徒美堂輩，都是華僑，黨員百分之七十以上，亦為華僑，四散於海外　的支部近七十單位，擁有黨員三百萬。這黨先在海外結胎，然後回到祖國的懷抱裏來生育，他們對於祖國的內心如何就在這一點明朗地反映出來。</p>
<p>我們的僑胞，赤手空拳，流浪海外，受盡人間苦惱，受盡人間敲骨吸髓，忍人所不能忍，自生自滅，一直拖到如今。他們不怨天，不尤人，這種日子過慣了，並不覺得自己可憐。祖國不想着他們，連得區區的教育復員經費也不肯給他們，他們卻時時刻刻懷念祖國，大量的捐款匯濟祖國。他們的愛國心總是高漲，好像單戀，覺得祖國樣樣都好。熱望祖國強，熱望祖國富，熱望祖國事事有面子。</p>
<p>然而抗戰的勝利之神帶來了華僑更悲哀的命運。自　羅槍擊我僑胞起，一直到荷印坦其隆慘案，華僑的生活仍漲透了眼淚。遙望着祖國，依然一團糟，低水準的政治作風，低氣壓的蠻幹鬥爭，一波未平，一波又起，真好比希臘神話裏多頭怪物海陀拉，砍去一頭，又生一頭。民族何辜，眼看勝利之果霉腐，而僑胞更間接的受苦受難。</p>
<p>僑胞希望祖國像黑夜等待天亮，然而祖國夜長夢多，說和而不和，說不打而打，像這樣的拖，將拖死了人民，拖垮了國家，拖倒了華僑。處於這種局面下，啞吧也會講出話來。華僑在高漲的愛國之心命令之下，不能再忍氣吞聲的緘默了，他們自動的組織政黨，參與國事，要大聲怒吼了。</p>
<p>他們對於政治·軍事·外交·經濟·文化·教育等等，都有光明的政綱，都有救弊的對策。他們的政治使命為「復興民族，安定國家」，這原是他們三百年來傳統的使命，今日將以新的姿態，發揚過去光榮的歷史，促進中華民國走上民有民治民事的坦途。他們所提出的國是主張共分五點：一曰和平統一，二曰改組政府，三曰軍隊國家化，四曰設立「新政實騐區」，五曰維持國家民族之自由獨立。</p>
<p>這五個國是主張中，第一點說要依據民意實現和平統一。這「依據民意」四個字好極了，目前的癥結就是缺少誠意，倘使以民意為依歸，就會有誠意，有誠意才可以和平，有誠意才可以統一。因為現在的老百姓，就日夜誠心誠意的馨香祈禱和平統一。第二點，改組政府，着重於「推選賢能」，老百姓也一定舉起雙手贊成。人是建國的基本。昏瞶可使一個政府無疾而終；低能可使一個政府成為革命的對象，我們不能漲紅了臉漲粗了筋，斤斤於名額上的爭執。我們要以人才第一，有一等的人才，才有一等的政府，才有一等的國家。「新政實騐區」，倒是一件有趣味的事。假使大家同意，爭執區或不難迎刃而解。至於國家軍隊化，各黨派不得妄求外力，侵害國家的自由獨立，那更是天經地義。</p>
<p>看這黨的文字，聽這黨的說話，追溯這黨的歷史，細察這黨的份子，我們當可相信他們是坦白無私，可稱是純民族性，純國家性，純客觀性，立在老百姓立場上的。不過我們現在所慮的也是所期望於他們的，要他們始終守住崗位，站在嚴正的老百姓立場上說話行事。因為華僑情緒熱烈，心地坦白，又與祖國隔離遙遠，容易但憑直覺，被人顛倒黑白，淆亂是非。這需要防之又防，謹慎而又謹慎。我們更希望：他們的一切活動是為了國家，一切的利益是為了國家！</p>

<p>中美兩國進行談判，磋商美國以剩餘物資售與中國的具體辦法，期間雖經中共的叫囂與抗議，但是兩國協定終於在前天簽字成立了。中國經過八年抗戰的犧牲與消耗，已到百孔千瘡的地步，戰後復興建國，正需要大批物資的補充。這次美國以大批的剩餘物資售與中國，對於中國經濟的安定及復興建國工作的進行，均將有莫大的裨益。我們對於友邦竭誠相助，應該加倍努力，儘量利用這大批物資，為余興我國的前途奠定一個鞏固的基礎。</p>
<p>依照這個協定的規定，美國售與中國的剩餘物資，為數甚鉅，原價總値在八萬萬美元以上。其中有：（一）散佈中國、沖繩島、關島、　班島及其他島嶼之流動物資，原値五萬萬美元；（二）在中國境內之固定設備，原値八千五百萬美元；（三）其他剩餘物資一萬三千萬美元；（四）小型輪船原來成本値九千萬美元；（五）積存於中國西部之剩餘物資，原値二千萬美元；（六）剩餘物資的裝運費用，約三千萬美元。總計為八萬五千五百萬美元。至於美國所得，僅清償對華債務七千四百萬美元，及獲得在華使館所需經費三千五百萬美元，墍促進中美文化教育事業費用二千萬美元。不足之數，均作為美國對華借款。這不能不說是美國對於中國友好的更進一步的表示。這寧唯是，美國對於這些物資如何運到中國，並願予以高度的合作，務須在廿二個月內完成工作。</p>
<p>中美兩國在大戰期間，駢肩作戰，早已成為患難之交，兩國人民間友誼，經過血的洗煉，益形深厚，決非任何宣傳攻勢所能離間。全國四萬五千萬人民，對於美國的好意相助，也只有感激而決不懷疑美國之另有企圖。即有時以此自問，美國為什麼願以這許多的物資售與中國？也很容易獲得解答。美國希望中國成為強大的統一的民主國家，而中國目前最迫切需要的，莫過於物資的供應。如果得不到外來的援助，不特復興建國無從着手，抑且國內資源枯竭，欲避免通貨膨脹也不可得。此其一。美國對華政策，完全着眼於商業的經濟利益；美國要到中國來經商，當要中國安全與繁榮，而戰後的中國，因無所尚未恢復，好比一個患貧血症的病人，惟有採用輸血的辦法，先使其復原，然後始有強健的希望。此其二。美國在這次大戰中，美國軍隊散遍全世界，因此在任何一個戰場，都有剩餘物資，如果不把它出售，對於美國也是有損無益，還不如出售了好。在歐洲戰場的剩餘物資，除了以一部份售與英國而外，大半都售與法國了，其所採取的方式也大致相同。此其三。</p>
<p>美國特別聲明：在這些剩餘物資內，並沒有軍械、彈藥、飛機、以及其他軍用設備，而完全是民用的物資，樣樣都是我國復興建國所必需的物資。所以，預料我國經過這一次的輸血之後，如果以此為起點，好自為之，把別人的血化為自己新生的血肉，則在中國復興建國的前面，必能展開一片光明的景象。在中美兩國邦交史上，這個協定的簽字與執行，無疑的將展開更光榮的一頁。</p>

<p>〔本報綜合消息〕倫敦一日廣播：希臘今日舉行公民複決，決定該國將由皇室抑由共和政府統治。黎明時，即有大量雅典選民羣集於投票處。據政府方面估計，在該國一百七十萬有資格投票之選民中，大致有百分之八十五至九十，將參與投票。投票　分兩種，其一上書「喬治」，另一則書「民主」。傾向恢復君主制勢力頗見濃厚。昨夜雅典方面，有國民解放陣綫黨員駕駛之卡車，在市街疾馳，教促民眾投票贊成「民主」，保王份子亦作熱烈宣傳，以軍號吹「達達帝帝帝」。其聲音係象徴希臘文中「彼將回來」之意。警察駐守城內各要點，以防不測。</p>
<p>巴黎一日廣播：今晨卻爾西迪克有武裝恐怖份子四十人，企圖阻止投票，然終　憲兵　散。貝洛波尼斯地方舉行公民投票時，並未發生事故。</p>
<p>倫敦一日廣播：今日淸晨，雅典卡薩里阿尼過，有右翼份子一名被來歷不明之人投手溜彈而喪生，另有共黨領袖一人被槍殺。</p>
<p>據聯合社雅典卅一日電，政府於希臘公民投票前夕宣布，最近四十八小時以來，保王黨與共黨迭次發生新衝突，有卅一人殞命，共黨徒在最近各次攻擊中，殺死士兵及平民十人。</p>
<p>據路透社華盛頓卅一日電：消息靈通之觀察家預料，希臘公民投票結果，必有大多數人民贊成喬治王之返國，據聞希臘遊擊隊，正自阿爾巴尼亞境內獲得大量軍器彈藥，並由阿爾巴尼亞及南斯拉夫志願軍允諾相助，故料投票結果揭曉後，若果係贊成君主政體，則大規模之暴動當不能免，美外交界人士認希臘乃聯蘇「韃靼尼爾攻勢」之「先鋒　」東歐集團對希所施壓迫，如召回大使，向安理會控訴，及向巴黎和會調整疆界等，已完全暴露十足強權政治之面目。就此次公民投票而言，蘇聯之策略，適足使希臘一般人民了解唯有確立君主政體，始能保持國家獨立，不然在共產政府治下之希臘，將完全入於蘇聯之統治，美官方坦白承認希臘問題中心，乃在於韃靼尼爾海峽之控制，希臘為巴爾幹半島上唯一不在蘇聯勢力下之一國，故美國外交政策對於希臘問題，正予以最重要之注目。</p>

<p>〔聯合社那不勒斯卅一日電〕美國最大航空母艦「羅斯福」號，於九月五日，即希臘舉行公民投票，決定喬治二世王復辟問題後四日，行抵希臘海面時，將派飛機一百廿五架翱翔雅典上空。據卡蕯台海軍少將今日宣布，此空中展覽，將應希臘政府之請實行，歷時約三十分鍾。各機將在空中寫成FDR三字。卡氏係美海軍機動部隊司令，其地中海巡弋曾引起莫斯科方面之批評，該艦隊於回國以前，或並將訪問韃靼尼爾及特里埃斯特亦不無可能。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：四強外長會議原定於明日繼續舉行，刻因莫洛托夫突返莫斯科之故，已予以展期。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅一日電〕此間對莫洛托夫之突離巴黎返國，有兩種傳說，一謂莫氏之行，正與今年四月間舉行外長會議時貝文之不時於週末返國相似，蓋莫洛托夫未與本國政府直接接觸已逾一月故也。一則謂莫氏此行，係蘇聯與希臘及西方國家外交衝突之結果。和會昨日之全體大會中，莫洛托夫曾與英代表亞歷山大，因外長會議是否應討論希臘——阿爾巴尼亞邊疆問題一點而起爭執。　兩說顯然不能並立，但吾人可以確信莫氏之返國，係為請示對希臘之外交政策。由於烏克蘭之控告希臘，已由安理會在討論中，希臘向阿爾巴尼亞要求割讓土地，已入和會議程，而希臘之公民投票又將舉行，故希臘問題已成今日最引人注意之問題。倫敦觀察家就過去一週中之蘇聯政策觀，相信希臘之公民投票，可能引起蘇對希外交政策之危機，苟投票結果確立君主政體，則蘇聯應取何種態度，自必大費周章，此莫洛托夫之所以返國也。</p>

<p>記者昨晨趨訪上月卅日抵滬之糧食部部長徐堪，叩詢當前糧政措施槪況，徐氏首稱：今年全國普遍豐收，尤以川省首屈一指，民食前途，無慮匱乏，此可象徵和平景象。古語云：「衣食足然後知榮辱」，民以食為天，糧食充裕，無論在政治上，建設上，均有莫大助力。至本市存糧，向極充沛，在青黃不接時期，早作事前準備，訂購洋米，陸續輸入甚多，不久將再有安南米五萬噸，暹羅米三萬噸進口。況江浙兩省新榖次第登塲，糧價問題，決無上漲，且有下跌趨勢。徐氏對華北產糧地帶被中共控制者，而由南方設法接濟各地人民問題，則稱：此為當然事實。惟北人以食麵粉為主，輸出範圍，亦以小麥高粱為限。徐氏復闡述各省縣徵實徵收，係按照旣定國策，陸續開始進行，經過情形至為良好，對歉收地區。政府為體恤農民艱苦，訂有減免條例，飭遵辦理。對戰時借糧，亦依照規定，每年還本付息。</p>
<h3 id="c64">梁敬錞談　東北糧食情形 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>〔又訊〕據上週返滬之東北糧政特派員梁敬錚語記者稱：本年三月間，奉命由平再赴東北，於遼寧，遼北，吉林三省辦理糧政設施，並陸續赴各地視察，為時五月。以上地方名為三省，實際祗足四十縣，普遍以產高梁為大宗，小米次之，大麥理次，大米則居第四位。過去並不種稻，在日本侵佔時期，利用水電力，開闢稻田，增加米量，一面移殖鮮民，推廣種植。惟當地高粱小米，年年豐收，民食自無問題，且有餘額向華北一帶輸送接濟。最近中美農業技術合作團，曾赴東北考察，針對各地現實需要，於將來改良農用器具種籽等問題，擬具計劃甚詳。一俟中美政府核準後，即予實施。則將來對東北農產品之改進，裨益甚多。梁氏謂日人過去竊據東省，具有積極開發之野心。試觀鬆花江來源小豐滿發電廠，即為明證。此廠設備稱東亞之冠，足使東北禾稻豐收，電力遍供全境工廠，將來我國政局開朗，種種方面步入常軌，當刻不容緩，利用此種設備，則收穫成效，難以估計。且東北人民風氣淳厚，土壤肥沃，生活水準不高，工廠完整，更足為光明之前奏。梁氏復稱：大豆亦為著名產物，戰前對美加輸出甚豐，現時豆餅每斤只值流通券十元，合國幣一百三十元，在上月十五日，已獲經濟委員會核準出口，如此措施，一則可增加臺省農作物肥料，再則可增當地農民收入。至該地糧食加工工廠小具規模者，約計二千餘，經常開工，其規模較大者，計五所，已照政院規定，先行標賣。對徵實徵收進展問題，梁氏稱：因氣候關係，秋收較江南為晚，約十一月間方開始推動。梁氏此次南歸，專向部方報告，一星期後，仍須北返云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕法商十八路無軌電車，於昨晚七時半自大世界駛往斜橋途經金陵路口時，適值紅燈，故司機於此暫停，斯時黃金大戲院正散戲，有海軍十二名出外，擬搭乘電車，但三九二號售票員梁光輝以半途開啓鐵門，有違規章，當予婉言拒絕，誰料此輩軍人，即爬窗而入，雙方因此一度發生口角。電車駛至康悌路杜神父路口，各軍人與售票員又復嚕　不休，幾生衝突，經乘客勸阻始止。但電車駛抵終站時，有乘客俱各下車，各軍人乃將售票員梁某拖拉下車，挾往南市，不知所終。旋由另一售票員投報該管警局縷述經過，經警方派員分頭調查，偵悉該售票員已被拘禁於江南造船廠原址之海軍練兵營內，法商電車工人得訊後，一時帬情憤慨，現當局對於雙方衝突之責任，正嚴密調查中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨據本市警察局消防處負責人語本報記者稱：本市現有之消防人員，約共七百名，其中多數皆富於經騐，甚至有服務達二三十年者，現因該項人員不敷應用，曾陸續公開招考二次，皆已分別派至各區工作，此次招考，已屬第三期，前往報名者極形踴躍，自廿六日登報之日起，每天赴該處報名者，為數約在百名左右，其中甚至有來自杭州者，錄取之標準，以體強力壯為先決條件，規定身高在五呎五吋以上，體重六十公斤以上，年齡二十至二十五歲，初中程度或同等學力之未婚者為合格。報名後首先受警察醫院檢騐身體，合格後並須測騐體力及臂力，如舉重，爬繩等，一切合格後，才得參加筆試。錄取之後，須入消防處訓練班，受訓期限規定為三個月，主要者為授以基本消防技術，如不同梯子之用法等，訓練期滿成績良好者，準予分派至各消防分隊，赴火塲實習，然規定於一年內不準離職，否則須賠償其受訓期間之一切費用。</p>
<p>據最近統計，該處現有之車輛數目如下：救火車共三十九輛，重車一輛，急救車一輛，病院車七車，照明車二輛，消防龍頭檢查車六輛。</p>
<p>該處負責人又稱：消防工作，與其他工作不同，消防人員日夜皆須準備出發，且須冒生命之危險。現彼等之待遇，與公務人員相同，因目前生活高漲，故量近頗多去職者，此種現象若繼續發生，則實堪憂慮。</p>
<p>目前彼等工作上所感覺唯一困難者，為救火龍頭之時遭損壞，考其原因，則為貪小之市民，常擅自偷水，且聞後不關，而一般頑童，則以碎石等塞入龍頭內，致使龍頭損壞，於應用時無水可放，前華德路大火，週圍水龍頭則皆損壞，水帶竟放長至一千三百呎者。故該處除每日派消防龍頭檢查車至各處嚴格檢查外，更望市民能予以密切合作，應深切明瞭，住所附近之消防龍頭，亦係自家生命財產之保障。務必予以週密保護。</p>
<p>又為謀消防工作之完善，該處正擬向美國訂購最新式之消防車多輛，該種車輛係噴射二氧化碳以滅火，專用於灌救油類之燃燒。渠末稱：本市之都市計劃中，使上海之消防，將作為全國之模範，故近來該處正努力求其改進中。</p>

<h3 id="c74">航運安全的保障者　閒話領港人物 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在水上交通的部門裏，有「領港」或稱「引水」這一項職業。其地位可以說是船主的顧問，其任務是在船舶進入某一個港口或駛航某一條水道時指導它的行駛線路，避免一切障礙與危險，因為每一港口或每一條水道都有它特殊的情形，並且時刻在變化。這種情形不一定是船主所能熟悉，為了保障安全，就需要請一位「識途老馬」的「領港」來引導。</p>
<p>上海這大都市，黃浦江中每天吞吐着不少的船隻，「領港」的業務自然比較發達。自從去年九月以來，這一個行業也有過一番滄桑。當勝利之初，因為最先來到上海的還是美國海軍，「領港」的任務就完全由他們擔任。後來一切慢慢地恢復常轉，才由國人接收過來，由同業公會管理支配，政府對於領港在戰前原有一個管理機構是屬於財政部管轄的。勝利以後改組成立全國引水管理委員會，改隸於交通部，由於復員交通的困難，上海辦事處，在今年四月間才籌備成立，經過相當週折方從同業公會手裏把管理權接收了過來。但是目前上海的領港業還是分成三個範圍，一是沿海外洋輪的領港，由海關管轄，一共有二十二人，其中僅有兩位是中國人，他們的工作範圍是從外灘到吳淞口為止。二是內河線短期性的領港，由引水委員會管理，共有一百多人，都是中國人，工作範圍從上海到漢口為止。三是長期性的領港，那是由船公司自行直接聘請，訂有長期契約的，總數約有五十多人。</p>
<p>除了訂有長期契約者以外，領港的收入每月由主管當局集中以後以比例分攤，按照各人所引領船舶的大小為標準。現在海洋輪領港的收入每月約在美金七百元左右。內河輪的領港則相差遠了。引水委員會規定每月有七萬元的津貼，出差一次另給二萬元，派　海軍艦隻去的再加十萬元，此外每月的總收入亦以比例分攤。據說每人的月入並不怎樣好，不過四五十萬元而已。</p>
<p>領港大都是舵工出身，也有做過船長的。以前由海關發給的執照，現在依舊有效。對於那些沒有領到執照的，引水管理委員會將在最近舉行考試，甄別他們的能力後發給。規定的資格要做過兩年以上船長或七年以上舵工，考試的科目除了中英文以外最注重的是水道，其次為海關避碰船藝等。如果考試不及格，將仍舊給他們實習的機會，至於訓練新人才方面目前還未聞有什麼是具體的計劃。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日為執行取締美貨攤販之第一日，記者曾至溪口路（朱葆三路）一帶巡視，覺得情形甚為良好，所有攤販均已遵令停設。上午曾有大隊警察前往該處巡邏，惟旋即撤去。狼藉滿地之空罐垃圾等亦經清道夫掃除乾凈。路上行人稀少，景象凄涼，僅有若干被取締之攤販，三五成帬，議論紛紛。有謂：「此次受取締都是被他們大公司起的主意」，言下頗有憤慨之狀。有則謂：「今天是第一天，當然給市長點面子，往後看吧，肚皮受不了，還不是化整為零偷偷摸摸的在別處擺起來」。亦有人則認為此次市府決心取締，要重振旗鼓未可樂觀。記者旁聽多時，所得最大印象即為彼輩對於生活前途均有茫然之感。</p>

<h3 id="c110">匯率與物價 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>物價的構成，不單是匯率，但是無疑的，匯率也是物價成因之一。所以這次匯率放長，物價有隨之波動的可能，但決不致等於匯率，或超越匯率的漲度。如有後述的現象，苟非出於一時刺激，就是居心不良了。這次匯率放長的目的，是在昭蘇國內工商，開發國外市塲，決不是為投機和暴利者製造機會。所以政府除應負取締和制裁的責任外，並需同時厲行與抑平物價有連繫的其他政策。</p>
<p>價格是由成本，（包括原料，工資，折舊，）開支，利息，捐稅，和利潤構成的，至於供求引起的影響，僅是利潤的伸縮而已。所以因匯率放長而增的成本，如在利潤範圍以內時，按理不應漲價。但是企業的最終目的，自然是利潤。政府為維持工商計，必須保障牠的合法利潤，有了合法利潤，就不易產生黑市。同時又為公眾求謀福利計，不能不限制牠的利潤，有了限制，就不至於一路哭了。所以在戰爭和承平，統制和自由的交替期內，尤其在自私的中國，醉心暴利的上海，評價制度，似乎所以提倡。也因為有了評價，取締和制裁，就有所適從。</p>
<p>貨物可簡分為三大類，（一）來自國外的洋貨。（二）國內製造品。（三）國內農產品。現在把各類貨物的內在情況，加以分析，那末就可明白除匯率政策外，應施的其他連繫對策，和評價制度下應有的標的了。在和平初時，進口商所得利潤，約有三四倍之多，此後到貨漸多，利潤稍減。最近私貨充斥，偷竊風行，以致進口商不復盡能獲利。所以從價格方面來看，政府如能根絕走私偷竊，未必因匯率變動，而生劇變。若再益以評價制度，或反可促其低落。</p>
<p>中國工廠所需的原料機器工具，雖然脫不離洋貨，但是究非全是洋貨。所以匯率變動的結果，物價決不致等於或超越匯率的漲度。今除政府已豁免出口關稅外，如屬必要，還得返還出口貨物稅，那末直接足以發展外銷，間接鼓勵增產，而使成本減輕。若再益以低利工貸或透支，和實施評價制度，就得緩和國內刺激的物價，而使各業互獲和平的調整了，製品價格的上漲，當然影響到肥料和農民的生活指數，在匯率變更中，政府僅限制農產品的漲價，似乎失之於平。但是農產品價格的波動，究竟較為平淡，如其政府能免除苛雜，杜絕滋擾。同時舉辦名實相符的低利農貸，實施評價，並調查農民生活指數等措施，或可使匯率刺激波動，更為平淡</p>
<p>總之，政府為防止匯率更動後所生物價的波動，就得注意與物價有聯繫的幾個對策。（一）根絕走私偷竊。（二）取締不合理的搬運費。（三）免除出口關稅。（四）返還出口貨物稅。（五）辦理低利工貸或透支。（六）切實辦理低利農具。（七）杜絕滋擾，厲行法治。（八）禁止苛雜捐稅。（九）普施評價制度。但是否所說的評價，是官民合作的廉能評價，否則領導漲價有餘，公平難見事實了。（稿費移助蘇北難民）</p>

<h3 id="c111">有心人的痛苦 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 周厚鈞</p>
<p>（一）三種事實的對比</p>
<p>我出重慶回來，因病　居蘇滬，最近回到闊別九年鎮江。千百萬軍民血汗換來勝利的成果是怎樣呢？這是我回來以後最迫切需要解答的問題。譬如就蘇州來講，民衆舉行瘋在式的大規模迎神賽會，一種熱烈的情緒和虔誠的能度，使我們　疑到這世界還不是原子時代。最叫人驚心觸目的，是成羣結隊的靑年男女，燒肉香，垂臂鑼，而談笑自若。這大槪算作他們對神祗的一種忠實表現罷！從這迎神賽會當中，可以看出民間集體娛樂的環境，和人民新的信仰，沒有建設起來，確是重要的原因。</p>
<p>回到了鎭江，蘇北難胞不少來泣訴些被鬥爭淸算的情形，那種殘酷的事實，似乎爲日本佔領時期所未敢有，簡直使我難以置信。煽動獎勵佃農對中小農的互相殘殺，爲的是什麼？眞的爲了爭一根骨頭不成？不，這是一種爭取窮苦老百姓打前鋒，替中共消耗對方子彈的陰謀。這完完全全的實施以飢荒暴力、驅使人民互相殘殺，以便奪取政權的政策罷了。我不能不質問，這一種殘暴的力量，爲什麼能够蔓延各地，「如火燎原」的起來？政府應負的責任是在那裏？</p>
<p>其在上海，那是紙醉金迷富人（？）的天堂！單以現在一種玻璃的用品來說，就流去了同胞們大量的膏血。這一種現象，固然是富人們忘却了遍野的災鴻，八年血的洗　換來的還是一個殖民地奴隸心理的復活！同時，這一類消耗性的商品，正向各地侵入，問接的破壞了廣大的農村基礎。道，政府方面，在經濟的設施上，又有什麼切實具體而有效的對策？</p>
<p>蘇州的迎神賽會，說明封建勢力對建國工作的反攻；鎭江難胞的泣訴，說明暴力專政對建國工作的阻撓；而上海荒　無度的情形，則是殖民地奴隸心理向建國的工作的襲擊。三種表現得方式雖有不同，而其結果則同爲毫無疑義的自殺。我們眼看國家民族遭遇這極度的危機，有心人還能漠然無動於中嗎？今後應該怎樣奮鬥呢！怎樣？能對得起爲八年抗戰犧牲的無數軍民呢？</p>
<p>（二）可爲痛哭者三</p>
<p>今日世界，尤其是今日的中國，是處在極度動盪的當中，有沉淪毀滅的危險。每一個問題，好像都沒有妥善的解決辦法、於是人人似乎都感到極度的煩悶與憂處；惶惶不可終日。</p>
<p>例如和平的實現，本是全國上下一致的要求，但在今日，已成爲野心家攻城掠地禍國殃民的譴符。古人說過：「後義而先利，不奪不饜。」大家在政治協商中，不談如何眞正實施三民主義的方案，切實救國救民的辦法，而祗斤於分配委員名額，整編軍隊若干，攻城掠地，惟恐不多，還有推波助瀾搖旗吶喊的人們，認爲這是和平的先決條件，殊不知「後義而先利，」適足以助長內亂，延長民衆的痛苦，將使和平久久不能實現。以這一種方式，來爭取和平，則「緣木求魚」的故事大家總該不會忘却罷，祇看到中小農的可憐的一點田地，而不惜以人食人，忘却了成爲問題的邊疆大塊處女地，又忘却了東九省的大批機器到那裏去。更未聞有人主張追究，這是一種什麼心肝？此可爲痛哭者一。</p>
<p>還有更令人啼笑皆非的，有些人在反美運動之下，故作美蘇戰爭的驚人之筆，而忘却自家的房子已經起了火。假使這一種議論。眞的鼓動了美蘇戰爭的話，是不是要中華民族打先鋒百先向美國宣戰？那時候的情景，請閉目想一想，國家該到了如何的境地？假使國家民族眞的一而倒在蘇聯懷裏，不知所以獨立自存的話，成爲天之驕子的將是那些人？目前更有人明目張胆出賣國家民族的人格，喊起「國際干涉」的口號來，中國　不決諸國民而決諸外國，什麼民主獨立」一古腦兒又都丟在腦後，原來動兵的目的，就在促起「國際干涉」，這又是一種什麼心肝？此可爲痛哭者二。</p>
<p>燒肉香以媚神紙，用淸算鬥爭的手段驅使同胞互相殘殺以爭奪政權，在理智方面都是「一丘之貉」·看着同胞們受災荒的壓迫而毫不動心，紙醉金迷地度他們的豪奢生活，這和以災荒驅使人民做消耗對方子彈的辦法，在人性上同是「　獻食人」·說到這裏，使我想起了。國父民生主義的偉大。中國式的共產黨的領袖們，要曉得玩火不是要的，國家民族和成千萬的老百姓的性命要緊。有人說：「外國制度和辦法，雖是舊了，中國人歡喜拿來當着新鮮頑意兒欺騙同胞；但是到了中國人手裏，就都變壞了·」這是何等可憐傷心的話。此可爲痛苦者三、</p>
<p>因此，就想到前次胡　之先生在上海文化界招待會上要大家多想想，多研究研究、「思則得之，不思則不得。旣然大家病根在放棄良心，請大家還是用思想把良心找回來。「哀莫大於心死！」一些也不錯。「掛肉香」，紙醉金迷，以及「鬥爭淸算」，和那些因煩悶而吸食白麵的，同是求消遣安慰興奮於一時。最可憐可痛的，是那些吸食白麵的無知人們，毒癮愈來愈深，直到他們拉倒算了！爲今之計，還是槍救人心第一！</p>
<p>（三）復與農村</p>
<p>古人說過：「凶年子弟多暴。」又說：「衣食足而後知榮辱·」國民黨執政已經二十年，三民主義的立法，也有不少成就，國民黨歷次全國代表大會，對於民生主義的決議案，以及</p>
<p>主席的歷次文吿，和「中國之命運一書，連篇累牘，如合作事業」的進行，如「土地問題」的解決，如「農業工業化」的推進，如各種「社會政策」「農工業政策」的決定，以及所謂「水利」，所謂「財政」、所謂「醫政」等等，倘使細細硏究起來，確實有不少的良法美意，如果逐步實施起來，也很足以使老百姓富强康樂。爲什麼到今天還有「率獸食人」的事實，會如火如荼的發生？這固然由於連年來軍閥割據，帝國主義侵略，以及中國共產黨的作祟，使政府無暇建設，但政府也不能自諱其「無能」。待到火上了房子，不加撲滅，却仍然還來從容允許分割房子裏面的財產：洪水已經衝破了堤岸，不加搶救，還來爭執分配堤內的田地。這種情形，政府是責無旁貸的。今日政府唯一自膀的方法，就在趕快實行國父遺教，主席文吿，履行歷次全國代表大會的諾言，別無旁路可走了。</p>
<p>又引一句老話：「智者無不知，知當務之爲急！」現在撲火的工作，除軍事以外，應該用政治。目前的危機，再也不容許軍事捱打，政治養奸！現在捱打的軍事，已使老百姓失望；政治却萬不能再事製造亂源。照目前江北收復的地方，以及共產黨流竄江南情形，他們這種化整爲零的辦法，唯有「政治」才能解決。江南又在以軍事防止暴動了！老實說，倘使政治老靠槍桿子，而不自振刷，則內亂將永無寧靖之日！嚴格地說起來，今日不但須實行「七分政治，三分軍事」，簡直要九分政治一分軍事了·因爲社會的洽與亂，繫於人心的向背。須知中國老百姓最可愛，倘使政治能够淸明，老百姓自己便會起來遏止亂萌的。政府如不相信老百娃，老百姓沒有自衛的武力，於是三五十個武裝不肖之徒，便足以裏脅廣大的農民，興師作亂。趕快的重新培養老百姓自衛的武力啊！老百姓是會自己選擇他們自己的道路的。就看政府用的人，是不是眞正愛老百姓，是不是能够在和老百姓學習中去領導老百姓罷了。</p>
<p>而政治設施方面的常務之急，無疑的是在農村問題。中國革命，原是要解除大多數農民痛苦的，政治方面，就該以復興農爲主要任務，同時以農立國的中國，在建國工作上，也應該以繁榮農村爲首要·針對現狀，挽救危急，更應該以搶救農村爲第一、</p>
<p>搶救農村也好，建設農村也好，復興農村也好，第一步的工作，常然是土地問題的解決·國父指示我們「耕者有其田」的政策，再不容緩的應見諸賞施。在第一次世界大戰以後，東歐的許多國家，如波蘭羅馬尼亞等國，是政府　款收買土地，分配給佃農；發行土地公債，收回超過耕種能力的地主的土地，再來分配。這是我們國父老早的指示，也有很好的規定。今日中國土地問題有三：荒地太多，生產力薄弱，以及分配問題。現在這三項應該乘機同時解決，也祗有統籌兼顧，才能使理想與事實都能得到妥善的解決·國父的三民主義和實業計畫，以及主席的「中國之命運」，實在是大手筆，政府不要再因循誤事的注意些不關痛癢的小節目，拿些魄力出來，切實的幹啊。大手筆要乘時乖勢的，決不是因循敷衍所能濟。</p>
<p>再如合作組織是「人盡其能」「地盡其利」「物盡其用」「貨暢其流」的一個有效的辦法。消費合作是以消費者的利益爲前提，產銷合作是以生產者利益爲前提，同時也是農業工業化的橋樑。化小農爲大農，集合多數人的力量爲一個力量，農業工業化方能完成。這樣做，合作組織的功用也才能發揮得盡</p>
<p>但是目前合作組織情形，並沒有發揮他們的功用，甚至反成爲剝削農民的工具，加重農民的壓迫，這應該馬上加以檢討改進和擴大進行。現在所舉辦的農貸，是否涓滴歸農，也應該加以檢討。今後放款的對象，以及土地的徵糧徵稅的實施，均不妨以合作組織爲對象爲工具，一切農建工作都該配合合作組織的推行。這樣，合作組織才能普遍的發展，才能完成他的功能。</p>
<p>其他如水利交通農業等建設改良與指導，農副業之管理與培養，均需一一加以檢討改進和切實實施，並且要毫不放鬆國際對於我們的救濟和帮助的各種物資，加以高度的配合和適當的運用。</p>
<p>「愚」「窮」「私」「弱」四個字，是中國農村的普遍的病徵，所以抵是對於　的問題解決還嫌不夠，應該還要加緊做「教」的工作。過去的教育是孤立了，鄉村的民眾教育更是孤立了。整個中國教育制度需要配合國情，趕快加以切實革新的。民眾教育似乎應該密切配合「醫政」以及各種有關農業建設，同時推進。民衆教育豈是設立一些民衆教育館做些點綴就算盡其能事？鄉村的民衆教育，應該以成人的補習教育爲主，必要切切實實的配合各種農村復興工作，它的教育內容，必要配合着各種農村復興工作的需要。像丹麥·美國、蘇聯，他們是在國民學校裏分成人部與兒童部，日本是在國民學校專設補習學校。農民佔百分之八十的中國，教育經費用之於農村有關方面的，和農民的負擔比較，是不是能得合理的數字？這一問題，是値得我們深切檢討和反省的。</p>
<p>但是在政治制度方面，也應該重行硏究一下。即以各種有關農村建設的政洽設施而論，過去是不是因爲各不相謀而減少了許多的效率。今後的政治主要設施，旣然以農村爲目標，各種有關農村建設工作，應該首先一元化的進行，這樣才能收到預期的效果，這是我附帶鄭重提出的。</p>
<p>（四政風的改過）</p>
<p>目前的政治問題，根本在政風問題，而政風問題還在能吾用人惟賢惟能。目前政風之敗壞，是在於賢愚不肖之不分。於是乎投機取巧脅肩諂笑之流，皆得夤緣干進，而公正賢良之士，有時反被屛斥，請問這樣的人事，怎樣能配合工作的需要？這樣的工作考核，怎樣能收治理的實效？再進一步說，中國政治的大病在「隔」，負大責任的先生們，要切實首先將自己過去的親信的人加以檢查一下。因此，選賢任能，請先從自己的左右做起，請先從負方面責任的人研究起！</p>
<p>孟子說：「將大有爲之君，必有不召之臣。」所謂不召之臣，正是賢者能者。從前魏晋隋唐時代所謂「九品中正」的辦法，到現在　飾得參考，爭取賢能，實在是當前轉危爲安撥亂反正一個先決的條件，據之，負責諸公，急須澈底的改換作風，而效法周公一飯吐　一沐三握髮的精神。國家民族的興亡關償，也　在此。一個革命政黨必須時刻注意提練人才，提興　是二　一。提煉人才不外六字；「民主」「團結」「統一」。虛心以求民主，以民主來爭取團結；以團結來爭取統一。所謂民主，必須與工負分　，工作考核，工作　賣密切配合，使每人都有　獻意見與　獻能力的機會。工作考　民主化，則是非明白；工作競賽民主化，則賞罰公平，　　人才民主化，則自然團結而發生力量·團結的力量建築在民主上面，何　不能統一呢？高度的民主，才能做到確實的集中統一，也才能推陳出新自强不息·這是政黨組織和政治制度最合理的原則啊！</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>顏惠慶先生月前在歡迎胡適之先生席上，他說中國問題是時間問題。我覺得中國的問題，已經到了危急存亡的關頭，不容懈怠·也不容等特。今日的問題，不是是非的問題，而是「是者是之」「非者非之」的問題。旣然曉得攘鷄之爲非，又何必等待？執政的國民黨與全國賢達之士，應該以己飢已溺爲懷，於自反自責之餘，共同奮鬥，肅淸自私小我或派系的思想，團結一致的前進。在這種團結一致奮鬥之下，「率獻食人」的一切腐惡勢力，自然趨於消滅。但是在團結一致前進的時候，必須肅淸「亂苗之莠」「亂朱之紫」以及模稜兩可的一切灰色份子。這種鄕愿式的灰色份子，在過去已誤了國民黨，誤了國家民族，是最足以爲敵人張目，使志士灰心的。必須肅淸這種假革命的份子，才能樹立民主的宏規，堅强革命的團結，統一建設的力量，也才能達成革命建國的任務，在我們這種堅強而具有正義的奮門之下，誠如顏先生所說問題的解決，不過是時間問題罷了。</p>

<p>架設越路橋之建議</p>
<p>交通最繁盛區域，如南北東西交織路綫，各種車輛極度輻輳中，警察要顧及車輛安全，行人安全，必須一方面路綫暫時切斷，使另一方面車輛得以通過，諸如此類，反復切斷，車輛時行時止，停車時間反較行車時間費上二倍以上。行人要穿越路面，失去自主，有時衝過橫路，危險萬分，甚至傷身致命，爲要避免危險，以及甬道淤塞，使車輛以及行人有程序的安全暢通，最妥的辦法莫過於架設越路橋·如中正路西爾路一段，各種車輛南往北去，行人啣接，倘在這段先架設越路橋，使南北車輛以及行人由橋上通過，橋面兩邊平舖行人道，兩邊行人來去，可嚴格規定其方向及應走橋或橋面下，這樣循序而行，可不受車輛威脅；橋下裝配日光燈，光度須要適中，橋下行人道要與路邊一式平舖，則行人車輛之行動，秩序井然，安全壯觀，俱可做到，不過越路橋對於小轉灣及有電軍行駛之交織路，是否需要另外精密設計，那祗得等待專家們的研究了。</p>

<p>育才停辯夜校真相</p>
<p>啓者：關於敝校停辦夜校，特解答如次：竊敝校於今年三月間秉才教育局意旨，配合　除文盲普及教育之工作網領，創設民衆夜校，由敝校教職員及高二高三同學共同義務担任教學。辦理之初，原擬遵照局令，招收文盲，惟恐創辦伊始，不易招生而影響開班，　將己受三四年教育者予以收納，致使學生程度參差不齊，遂加以分班，別爲高，中，低三級。高級程度，相當於五六年級，中級相當於三四年級，低級相當於一二年級。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>配件和一部分原料的缺乏，使美國各汽車廠，遭受到困難的境過。一般的實業界人，更深信這種情形，一時尙不能好轉。而本年度的汽軍產量，也將比預期之數減低不少。假如現狀無改變，那麼谷大汽車廠的裝配室勢必難能生產二百萬輛客車之數。這樣比之一九四六年預定計劃，減少一半以上。回顧歐洲戰爭結束，美國汽車生產恢復常態努力生產的結果十個月中，　製成新車三十萬輛。</p>
<p>通用車廠在此十個月中，經過十九個星期的工潮，才於五月底復工，此中汽車的生產量，當然受到嚴重影饗。福特車廠自去年七月起竭其全力，大量製造，但因爲鋼鐵的缺少，也曾彼迫停工一星期，各裝配室全都停頓，一無生產，當五月底停工時平均每天產車三千五百輛，而平常可產五千輛。克雷斯勒廠連同所有分廠，每天產車二千五百輛，但因原料缺乏，在短時期內、決不會增加。而大罷工之時，也曾使克電期勒廠生產最多的順風牌裝配室停工多日，所受影響，自亦非小。派克車廠由於零件缺乏曾停工九星期，後雖盡力使之復工，而短時期內，生產也無法增多，特別是爲鋼鐵的缺少。斯蒂倍克廠雖有着手製遭一九四七式新車的計劃裝配室也會一度停工。</p>
<p>目前美國汽車製造業的嚴重問題、乃在製作車身及防泥板的鋼板，供應不足，而其他各種鋼鐵鑄造物亦然。若干車廠表示所存緩衝器已無多而另一部分車廠所製汽車，竟不用緩衝器了。關於製車的原料，零件，配具，沒有一個車廠存貨是可認爲平均的。至於交通的不便，更影響到各車廠的生產。在四個半月罷工期內，通用車廠曾存有大量的原料及配物，所以未來幾個月中，他們的產車工作，一時還不致有何影響。各車廠對於煤礦工人的罷工問題曾特別注意因爲這可使鋼鐵產量減少，而間接是影響到汽車的產量。</p>
<h3 id="c115">從水力到原子能 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 林漢譯</p>
<p>三百年前，一六四六年五月廿三那一天，美洲開始第一次特許專利。</p>
<p>Jiseph　Jenkes，一個浮躁的夥子，在一六四二那一年離開了他的鄕土—英國，來到麻　諸塞州的來茵（Lynn），在那裏，他帮助建立英國在美洲的殖民地的鼎盛的鐵工業。</p>
<p>Jenkes在他所移居的土地上，發現了豐富而人力所不及的自然寳藏。他最大的需要似乎爲一些機械來帮助人類工作，於是他專心致力於此一間題；迄一六四六年三月六日他申請水力鋸木機的專利權，他譽這部機器爲水力推動磨輸機』。</p>
<p>麻薩諸塞州政府對Jwnkes發明特許專利十四年。這是政府第一次根據國家專利會議給予發明者的一種獎賞。隨着，其他殖民地皆步麻州之後，實行專利法，鼓勵新發明。</p>
<p>喬治華盛頓（George　Washingtou）及湯麥斯、傑佛生（Thomas　Jeffceson）皆堅決相信以專利來獎賞作者或發明者的工作的辦法。當合衆國憲章制定時，所有的人皆堅持應包括使國會有權力建立專利制度的規定。</p>
<p>一七九〇年，首次合衆國專利法制定；合　國政府根據此項法案第一次特許專利的是製造苛性鉀的方法。</p>
<p>經四十六年的時間，幾乎所有　請專利的皆無不照准，發明的事物及起源却很少被注意。後來，在一八三六年，所有發明，專利的記錄皆遭火焚，以爲重訂專利制度之始。</p>
<p>國會設專利局爲一獨立機構，專利的號數再從頭開始。第一號專利權是給予一位議員的翰洛格氏（John　Ruggles）他曾對已粗具形模的蒸汽火車有所發現</p>
<p>自那時起，准許的專利案幾達三百萬宗。在一九四六年，恰當Jenkes在麻薩諸塞州獲得第一次專利權後三百年，合衆國政府批准了原子能的專利權。人類在三世紀裏，已由水力時代躍到了原子能時代，誰知道在以後的三百年中，人類的進展會到達甚麼程度呵！</p>
<p>專利法的保護，當然是美國工業的膨大的因素。專利對個別的發明家及對較小之製造廠家是極端的重要，專利的保障常常成爲使他們能够在事業的角逐場上與大工業競爭的唯一辦法。</p>
<p>美國已有一有力的專利保護制度，但其觀念本身並非新的。因爲人類在發掘做事的良法以前，每人自己均已設法取得他們發明的思想的利益·世界上第一次專利權據說是給予一個古希臘時代的廚子；他發明一種新的美味的食物，那時當地的皇帝便給他以一種獨有的製造，使用及發賣的權利。</p>
<p>在華盛頓　利局人門的匾額上，刻着一句曾穫幾次合衆國專利權的發明家亞伯拉罕林肯（Aroaham　Lincoln）的名言：</p>
<p>專利制度增加天才之火的有益的燃料」。</p>

<p>— 費文</p>
<p>遠在十數年前，中華書局屬下有一個科學用具廠。招集了一班十三四歲的學徒，傳授他們有些近乎雕刻藝術品製造　型標本科學儀器的工藝，這一班學徒被管理得極嚴格，而他們自己也肯孜孜不倦，工課之餘，另組硏究社，拳不離手，手不釋卷的揣摹，閱讀有關圖案及書本。其間，被同事中稱得上佼佼者有周仕臣，丁佩强，朱錦榆，趙黎博，孫伯膺和鍾傢勤等六位。</p>
<p>不幸，戰事爆發了，中華廠被迫停業，於是他們失業了—非但失業，而且更失了他們硏究的據點。爲了麵包，他們只得各自爲政的投門路改行業，但一方面，在暗地裏他們還志同道合的常聚在一起，硏究他們所心愛的工藝。也竟因爲藉他們做人的努力，他們雖改了行，但在外行生意中，也個個冉冉向上，抗戰八年的過程，在商業社會中，他們竟多數爬到了各公司或學校的主任或校長地位，論名論利皆今非昔比，直臨勝利，論個人出發，他們是沒有理由，也想「復員」的。</p>
<p>但有一個心念，堅定了他們的行程，他們認爲只有每個人獻身於他們所「學有所長」的事業去圖發展，而絕不以投機取利爲人生目的，纔是眞正的愛國之道，何况他們所欲從事的事業，是很明顯的，於祖國教育大有禆益的呢！</p>
<p>決定後，他們開始行動，不惜將自己歷年的積蓄變爲事業的股票，不惜把自己長衫脫下重新跑進工塲去，什麼主任校長的名利觀念於他們似乎很淡泊，就那麼樣，在陝西北路一條潮濕的小街內被人們發現一家新設的小型工廠，他的資本只有四千萬，工作人員只有卅餘人，但他們對這個事業的愛護，精神是無限公司的「新中科學用具製造廠」。</p>
<p>廠房佔三樓三底，據經理周君吿記者，眼前够敷應用，樓下除辦公室，會客室，物料室外，餘爲粗工塲，二樓全部細工塲，三樓爲職工宿舍等。這一類工作極細碎而且複雜，記者因「外行」，亦難口述其詳細，從工作的直的方面說，大槪可分爲駛工，塑工，色工，及剝製等數　，在橫的方面看有石　製，蠟製，紙製及採植原有動植礦物·而予以防腐術等數種。</p>
<p>至於出品方面除各項動植礦物標本外，有全部的人體剖解，骨骼詳表，內臟分類，以及病理現象如天花，花柳，酒毒，等他若某種工業生產過程引用實物來圖解以及科學上應用的儀器等亦皆在工作　　內。</p>
<p>因格於公司紙織及行政上的便利，他們也有經副理及主任等職權的分配，但有二點，卻值得我們注意。</p>
<p>一、他們是全體參加　際工作的，副理工佩强據說是個中蠟製品的權威，因此他一日間大半的工作在蠟製工塲間中，被削平了的頭頂，配襯着沒有衣袖的雙手，在一刀一刀的修刻下一副一孩兒面」出現了。看他對於工作的莫大興趣與認眞似乎早已忘却在一個月前，他還是　太樂舞　的會計主任呀！</p>
<p>二、他們在廠中的生活，又好像是一個生活集團，記者看見會客室內掛着一方廠規條文，奇怪的是內巾有一句說「在工作時中我們是同志，在工作時後，我們是兄弟」可見他們相互間是如何的了解與愛護在管理方面從各種設備上，很可以看得些　整的面貌，有逐日的行政日記，廠務日記，有各項報吿，分類記載等。這個爲了文化的小工業，値得記者推荐，更盼望教育界予以最大的援助，全國各級學校以及醫藥界等，歷經戰時損失，常然對於前存的科學儀器標本模型等文具多遭遺失或遭損壞，那麼，新添與修理，實爲急需，言自然科學的教授法，書本記載，不過備一個先後的系統，耳聞不如目覩，齊備各項實物模型，給學生有一個深刻的印象實在此書本還重要，據該廠周經理說，全國經營該項工業的廠家，還不滿十數，也足以證明我國對於科學的落後。所以該廠的新創，從內在的言出發，從外在的言需要，都値得器重，我們寄以至高的同情給以可能的援助，應該是每個人的職責。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>但雇用女工或童工，也有下列的短處：</p>
<p>A工作能力不如男工。在歷來工廠試騐的結果，女工的工作效能，不及男工，這也許對於女工不必負担家用一點，有相當的關係，因爲不需要負担家用，責任心就較次，責任心校次以後，工作效率很容易减退，但是女工體力較差，不能勝任呆重的工作，也是原因之一。</p>
<p>B女士容易缺席：女工第二個短處是　缺席，譬如在生產期，月經期，都是造成缺席的原因，根據幾個廠家的統計，女工缺席的次數要比男工增加百分之五十至一百。</p>
<p>C女工需要更好的環境：因爲女工的身體，一般地不及男工强壯，所以工廠的環境，如溫度，空氣、陽光等，都需要更好一點，同時如果雇用大批女工，那末還需要有其他設備如托兒所哺乳室等，使女工能够把她們的孩子帶到廠裏，這樣，可以使她們安心工作，這種設備，在廠方就需要一筆支出，但在工資上所節省下來的數目，或者依舊是合算的。</p>
<p>像紡織廠紗廠等是雇用女工最多的地方，在做包裝的工作，也以女工比較相宜。</p>
<p>用男工還是用女工</p>
<p>關於這一個問題，不能一概而論，完全要看製造的情形而定，下列幾個原則，是應該考慮到的：</p>
<p>A男工還是女工比較地對於所需做的工作更能够勝任？</p>
<p>B一般的習慣是怎樣的？</p>
<p>C在事實上招男工還是女工比較容易？</p>
<p>關於第二點，對於工作效能方面，很有關係，因爲譬如做某一種工作是慣常用女工的，那末自然，以雇用女工爲宜，因爲因此可以得到技術熟練的工人，可以省却訓練的工作。凡是不熟練的工人，一則工作　緩，二則因而不免工作得不合標準，三則容易耗損原料，這三點在製造廠商都是一種</p>
<p>實際製造以外所需時間</p>
<p>在一般製造廠裏，實際在機器上所耗費的時間，往往只佔總共製造時間的一半或三分之二，（亂　情形而不同）例如一家印刷廠，要印成一張印刷品，在印刷機上所需的時間，並不佔居總共听需的時間，譬如把紙張切小，在印黃色之前，把紅色的油墨洗去等都需要相當的時間，如果在機器上的時間已經極爲經濟，而在其他方面所化的時間有了浪費，那末不能得到整個的經濟，速度就要减退，生產就要减少，而成本就要增加，利潤因此减低。</p>

<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>芭蕉又綠了，是知了叫的季節！</p>
<p>你愛夏季的薰風嗎？那麼徐徐的，徐徐的像是曳着一葉輕綃，尤其是在夜晚，當夜晚納涼的時候，你是否愛那繁星與明月；你是否想了解一點生的啟示，靑蛙雖是太喧囂的吶喊着。但不用去管這煩燥的夜樂，你且靜靜性子，在躺椅上或者是凭着窗，默默的凝望着遠遙的星辰，那點點無限的靑藍的光芒，是一首讀不完的長詩，你試用你的幻想的鎖錀，用你聰穎的智慧去發掘，就會獲得珍貴的生的啟示，會使你了解人類崇高的感情，人間的愛與恨，人與人之間的隔膜，距離及羨嫉……</p>
<p>幼小的時候，曾經有人吿訴過我：「一顆星辰是顯示一個人的生命，當你生命終結的時候，藍天上就會有一顆流星殞落已不要認為這是一句無稽的話，這種神秘的象徵意味，細細的想一想，你便會覺得生命的可貴，人是生活在人羣之間，正如星星中有一個是你的生命，不要戀戀於春天的花與秋天的月，唯有夏夜的星辰會啟示你更聖潔的感……</p>
<p>夏夜的彩色雖是　　的，你不要太息星光的黯淡，人生也是一樣，人是為着自己而活的，但你不要忘卻自己是生活在人羣之間，雖然，一顆星的光輝是微弱的，生命也並不是多末遠長，而你能在人羣裡留下一點記憶，能在別人的心裡留下一點懷想……這樣，你生命的歷程里不會是一片空虛的白紙，不要在人生的路程上停留，不要怠息，盡量以生活的熱情來點綴一生短暫的歲月，一個人應該努力顯示自己的光輝，如同夏夜的星辰一樣，縱然是一點靑藍的光，也應該留下這點光芒在人間，這樣你才沒有白白的浪費了自己的生命。</p>
<p>夜晚納涼時，你該多領略一點夏夜的星辰，就會懂得生命的珍貴，你就會了解生的啟示，對這夏夜深邃的啟示，崇高的感情就會凈化得更聖潔了！</p>

<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>住在都市裏，看朝霞只是一種呆板的或是多餘的東西，倘若是一此過着夜生活者，或者是安臥在深嚴華廈裏的人，日上三竿，還未展開惺忪的睡眼，那麼朝霞對他們已不知是何物了。</p>
<p>住在市郊或者在鄉村裏，黎明起來，站在那一片展開寬闊的與天接連的草原，或者從那些連綿的臥在雲朶下的紫色的山　上，這樣看朝霞，便可以知道經過夜里死灰色的大地，已被充沛着生命的光明所喚醒了，看出一日之計在於晨的光景。</p>
<p>我是住慣鄉間的，現在也是住在遠離市區的偏僻郊外，窗前的草原，便像是我腳下無邊無際的綠色地氈，遠遠一帶的小樹林，引我的視線接觸到天邊去；每天的黎明，我把朝東的窗子打開，靜望着遠天的朝霞。</p>
<p>起先是銀白色的帶着薄霧的光綫照來了，慢慢地朝霞便像一曲神奇的交響樂，從柔徐的和合漸進入歡樂跳躍鏗鏘的音階，紅的金黃的光環，撒開了擴大了。生命之泉的色彩，和生命之泉的音樂，在合奏着人類享有金色的　光呵！</p>
<p>一片片的，有顯形線狀秀俏的，又有細碎得似魚鱗一般的雲霞，向着沉默的天幕散開去，對着她你可以找到世界上什麼是美麗，什麼是高貴的了。逝水般的歲月，縱算是你滄涼的人生，已在流年殘暮裏，萌起厭倦生息的念頭，但是，靜望了一片朝霞，她給你添上再生美麗的希望。</p>
<p>那些　微的全靠着生地土活的鄉民，在他們的面前，雖然只不過投下一個自己陰暗的影子，這正如他們終生拖着災難的陰影一樣。但是朝霞染在他們的臉上，洒落他們的胸膊，使他們仍然毫無憂愁地辛勤工作下去，這是朝霞給他們的力量，他們知道珍愛生活的勞碌。當一個老農荷着鋤頭，慢慢踏過草徑上金亮的朝霞，默默地向着遠方走去，他的面前輝映着一幕絢燦朝霞的遠景，一切都是這麼光華煥發，你說這是人生的開始，抑是人生的結束呢？</p>
<p>我愛這揭開光明之門的朝霞，生天清晨我站在窗邊，雖然腦子裏還繚繞着昨夜憂　的影子，但是我推開了窗，依舊唸着泰戈爾的詩句：「我們的慾望借彩虹似的顏色給衹有灰白色雲霧的人生！」</p>
<p>充滿希望的朝霞，願你喚醒沉睡着的人們吧！</p>

<p>— 浩然</p>
<p>如果說重慶這座悶沉的山城也有其撩人心魂的之處，那就不能不算是它迷迷濛濛，如醉如睡的夜景了。的確，如果你緊追着那肚子擠得滿滿的，屁股冒着黑煙的公共汽車去捕捉繁榮，你進入那嘈雜紛亂，三教九流的茶館去享受悠閒，你走到那人山人海，俗不可耐的公園去欣賞風景，那麼失望的大門將為你而洞開，煩惱的思愁將要填塞住你的腦際，國為壓根兒你走的就是不可能的路子，你迷落在幻想的煙雲中，你要瞭解重慶的偉大決不在它的高樓大街，不在它的斜坡危崖，不在它的擁擠喧囂，而在它巍巍然不可輕侮的精神，這精神是民族永生的唯一的保證。同樣，你要領略這山城的雄偉而壯美的輪廓，你就不能不置身於山城以外，遙遙地用着藝術家的眼光來觀賞。</p>
<p>在長江南岸的海棠溪，遠望重慶的夜景，那真是一幅太美麗的畫片，收拾在我印象的畫冊中，至今不曾忘懷。在夜色蒼茫中，茂茂密密的電炬發出一股錯黃的光圈，瀰漫着天宇。光圈在城頭最為眩眼，接着一層一層的向上昇，一道一道的微弱，直到和浮沉的云翳交接處，再也分不出那裏是雲煙，那裏是光影了！這座突然隆起的山城，在茫茫的夜光中，髣髴是一項西洋神話裏所描寫的皇冠，其氣槪的軒昂，真是蓋世無雙！是的，它是一座人民世紀中的皇冠，它戴在每一個愛國的中華兒子的頭上！它挺立在過去的灰黯的日子中，幾度的狂風暴雨，天天的炸彈烈火，都震撼不了，它真是中國的驕傲；它更把它的光明投射到全國的每一個角落，使在黑暗中摸索的人們，得有前進的指針；使在失望中嘆息的人們，得有心靈的藉慰！</p>
<p>獨個兒靜靜地佇立在草坡上，然而隔江的市囂還是若斷若續地傳入你的耳鼓裏來，似乎在吿訴你山城的人們，還是在夜以繼日地經營他忙碌的生涯。這種人間的聲籟正是生活的旋律，管你是喜悅也好，煩厭也好，只要是為煙稠密的地方，都會在陣陣的演奏着，山城那能例外？不過，這時稀時密的音响駕着微微的夜風，飄飄徐來時，倒也不無悅耳的節拍！夜，這聲色俱佳的山城之夜，赤裸裸地在你的眼簾前展開時，你能不流連再四，悠然忘返？</p>
<p>衹有在朦朧的夜色中，衹有在惺忪的燈光下，重慶的景色才是迷人的。滿天燦爛的星星似乎都為羨慕它的雄姿而眨着明媚的眼珠，長江中潺潺的逝水似乎也為它的壯觀而唱出祝福的讚歌，遠觀夜景溺於想像的美境中的人兒呀，他怎捨得移步遽離？真的，要不是長江夜渡輪上的一聲悽然的長唳，又怎會知道時鐘的雙腳已跑過了夜半？</p>

<p>— 葉勁風　20</p>
<p>根據我的觀察，這時雙方軍隊，都沒有一個統一前綫的陣地戰，大槪分開好幾個區對壘，再找上些遭遇小戰。</p>
<p>「行哪，老伯，」他好像舒了一口氣，「咱們可以上大路了，我聽見有咱們人說話，還有車子，好像洋車。」</p>
<p>我也依希看得見一百米外，有一條公路的模影。緊走了幾分鐘，就看見公路上有一條行列；看那動作，似乎是人力車的行列，很長的一行，大約在十多二十部模</p>
<p>發現了公路，又看見了這長長的行列，身子輕鬆了一半。依希聽見車夫在大膽談着打仗的情形，一面跑，一面談着；似　還有病人呻吟的聲音，雜在其中。</p>
<p>等到我們斜插過去，快要踏上公路的當口，忽然聽見有重量卡車高速度行駛的聲音，從後面傳來，僅僅一兩分鐘模樣，車前的燈光，已經像一般水柱，在射到前面的洋車行列上。</p>
<p>「呵…呃…！」是一部軍用大卡車，上面似乎有十來個倭軍，吆喝聲裏，雜着兩下槍聲。</p>
<p>我們伏在公路旁的田埂邊上。過去十來米的洋車列行，已經亂了陣容，前面後面，有的已經停下，有的加上了速度，有的邊停邊走。大卡車就在我們伏下不遠的地點，嗤的一聲，強制停住。全副武裝的「皇軍」，一個一個跳下車來。</p>
<p>衝鋒！…「分兩行包抄！」有人下着命令；車頭頂上的小型探照燈業已開放，混亂了的洋車行列，在探照燈的強烈光綫下亂成了一團糟，因為有的還企圖拉着車子往路旁田野裏逃避。</p>
<p>「洋車上都是咱們的傷兵！」小老虎怕我沒聽真，一連說了兩遍。</p>
<p>「皇軍」　勇武的表演，正式展開了；有的用刺刀，有的稍為帶了些人情的，衹用槍，托，—刺，搗。車夫們狂叫亂逃，車上的傷兵，有的自己滾下車來，有的被拖了下來，摔在地上，或扎上一刀，或找補一槍。</p>
<p>衹有一點，我看得很明白，這些傷兵，和車夫，沒有一人有武器，連刺刀都沒有一柄。</p>
<p>「唉…！」我恨得嘆了一口氣。對於我，這是一種侮辱性的挑戰，然而我應當怎麼辦呢？就拿總部的牌子身份，也決難挽回這一幕慘劇。假如同他們這羣瘋狂了的武士道者對敵起來，我個人的性命是不算什麼，但是我還有更重要的使命呢！</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>抗戰八年期間，中國報人夠稱對得起國家的了。</p>
<p>以上海一地來說，淪陷後他們英勇屹立於原來的工作崗位，更無畏地發揮報人的天職，自朱悜公起，程振章，張似旭，金華亭，一個一個都面對敵偽，無情撻伐，決不懦怯！無怪新聞界前輩陳布雷張季鸞先生勉勵當時在上海為民族正義奮鬥的同業為「第一等報人」。</p>
<p>壯烈殉國者對這種讚詞是當之無愧，而經歷了那段驚風駭浪　魅　　的生活仍能保全生命的，也同樣該受這一頌讚。</p>
<p>淪陷區同業在手鎗炸彈下工作，其實大後方的同業，除敵機轟炸外，防空洞平價米種種生活，慢性地攫奪了報人的健康，其遭際之不幸，正無二致。我們今日悼念死難的同業，同樣也該回憶一下這些耐受煎熬的活的鬥士。</p>
<p>有一點該慚愧的，就是這八年來，我們還沒有一個在戰塲上殉難的同業，這一事實說明了我們的努力不夠，假使我們更能實地的把握戰訊報道，也許至少會有一二人這樣光榮地失去生命。這一說法並非殘酷，有過戰地記者經歷的同業，坦率檢討之下，會承認的罷！</p>

<h3 id="c125">丘八將軍　馮玉祥 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>馮玉祥將軍奉命赴美，今日啓程。馮氏自二等兵出身，有「丘八將軍」之號，將軍得有今日，完全由於苦學。馮氏今日出國，考察水利，想必能為戰後建設多所貢獻。這裏謹略述一些馮氏的苦學精神及其軼事，聊表我們對將軍的欽佩。</p>
<p>馮氏家境貧寒，但他父親雖曾典當過日，而對兒子教育卻不疏忽。在極困難中，家裏仍請着一個先生。因此馮玉祥幼時漏夜攻讀，不敢稍懈。但不幸的遭遇接踵而至，十一歲時又喪母，家境益艱，不久，辭去了教書先生馮氏被迫綴學。</p>
<p>十六歲，他人伍當兵，常讀彭公案，三國演講等書。</p>
<p>當兵不忘讀書</p>
<p>那時馮氏看書見到不識的字，便稱之為「攔路虎」，暫時不理它，繼續地看，等到一個段落結束，他就和「攔路虎」算賬了。他把那些生字，去請教一位營中伙夫，那伙夫比他懂得多，便做了馮的老師。數十年來在軍旅的生涯中，馮氏讀書，從未間斷，直至廿二年八月，他就任民眾抗日同盟軍總局玲，入居泰山五賢祠，為時四年，這四年苦學，對他一生大有好處。當他下山後，打油詩已做得很好，寫得一手好字。</p>
<p>廿六年滬戰爆發，馮氏首任第三戰區司令長官，指揮顧祝同，陳誠，張發奎，張治中等將領，率部保衛大上海。此時之馮將軍，最為開懷，因為他是中國第一個興起抗日旗幟的人。按遠在民國十三年喜峯口之役，他以大刀對大砲，不惜任何犧牲與日寇掙扎。</p>
<p>親自出馬募捐</p>
<p>政府西遷，他隨着到重慶，依然喜歡讀書，寫文章。他在四川宣傳節約救國運動，沒有一個人不為之感動。記得他在成渝公路上的內江，為獻金運動曾號召了千百個小學生叫他們在街頭巷尾向人募捐。一日一輛自備汽車穿過馬路，馮氏即命小學生攔住汽車去捐款，小學生遵囑將汽車攔住。車廂裏坐着一個衣服華貴的太太，學生向她捐款，不僅一毛不拔，且置之不理，最後說：「沒有錢」，後來有一個學生報告馮氏，他立即親自出馬，他說：「你真的沒有錢嗎？」她答：「真沒有」，他又問：「抗戰這樣的緊張熱烈，物價如此的高，汽油如此的貴，你為什麼要坐汽車，你可知道一滴汽油一滴血嗎？」那個太太無話可答，馮氏又說：「坐自備汽車還沒有錢，太沒有良心，好，你沒有錢，手上帶的金戒指與手錶請你拿下來吧！我們的希望是有錢出錢，有力出力！那位太太自知慚愧，便把金戒指與手錶取下來了。當時在塲的民眾無不敬佩馮將軍愛國的熱誠！</p>
<p>在成都他到中央軍校作獻金運動的演講官生聞之悲痛入骨，全校學生遂將平日　餉之積餘十萬元捐出。</p>
<p>但馮氏說：「武裝同志不要捐，流血流汁已經夠了。」</p>
<p>最會講演的人</p>
<p>有一次他在少城公署演講，因為觀眾的水準不一，他說得極其通俗。他說：「我們國家抗戰已七年，別的不講，就拿一挺機關槍來說，機關槍的速度，每分鐘二百五十發，機關槍的速度，每分鐘二百五十發，從民國廿六年七月七日到現在，大家算一算，將士犧牲數百萬。那麼，一挺機關槍要消耗多少彈藥，何況還不止一挺呢」？聽眾中一個老嫗感動得淚如雨下，並將平時積蓄所得一併捐出。</p>
<p>現在，馮將軍已是六十開外的老將，因此，他已是準退役。但老當益壯，他還要為中國造福，因為赴美考察水利，也就是替我們後代子子孫孫做好事。</p>
<p>目前，將軍曾對某記者說：「國事與水利一樣，國事有辦法，水利也有辦法」。我們希望將軍公畢返國時，國事與水利都有了辦法！</p>
<h3 id="c126">中國保甲制度　印度想學習 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>據法國新聞社新德里八月二十七日電稱：「印度各地暴動不已，治安堪虞，臨時政府主席尼赫魯發起推行形如中國之保甲制度，以防發生搗亂。」中國的「國粹」居然流傳到外國去，在中國人看來自然是引為「與有榮焉」的事情。</p>
<p>說起中國的保甲制度，在王安石以前，早已有了類似保甲的組織。</p>
<p>三千年之前的井田制度，便是保甲制度的濫觴。我國軍事學家蔣百里曾稱它是一種「旣可耕田吃飯，又可出兵打仗的國防制度」。其後周代的所謂「五家為比，五比為閭，四閭為族」等的組織，較井田稍形精密。齊桓公的所以能「覊諸候，一匡天下」，也就是用了管仲「軌·里·連·鄉」的保甲法。秦商鞅倡「連坐法」，雖其目的在於箝制人民，但卻也收到相當的效果。</p>
<p>直到宋代熙寗年間，王安石創立保甲，才算得「體大思精」，不過王氏的保甲制度與今日還稍有不同的。他在上五事剳子中，陳述保甲制度的優點，特別提出兩項：「察奸而顯諸仁　宿兵而藏諸用」。只是後來為各界反對，沒有成功，但終於把保甲制度給後代留下了一個具體的規模。</p>
<p>王安石以後，創辦保甲而成功的有兩人：一個是明朝的王陽明，一個是清朝的曾國藩。他們二人都不過是「一介書生」但在保甲實行的技術上，有很多貢獻。</p>
<p>中國的保甲制度，也曾被日本偷用了一次：事情在甲午戰後，日本佔領臺灣，臺島青年不甘壓迫，紛紛組織義軍反抗，日軍屢剿不果，感到非常頭痛。後來日本在臺灣的「民政長」叫做後藤新平的，學中國的陳規，厲行保甲制度，不數年各地紛爭都不戰而息，成為了「王道樂土」。回顧我國有保甲而不善運用，真令人感慨系之！</p>
<p>印度也要模仿我國實行保甲了，我們當然表示歡迎。只是印度在今日，國內危機四伏，政府尚受英帝國的羈絆，假使國內還不能合作，只把中國保甲制度學去作「防止發生搗亂」的工具，那就大失保甲的本意了。</p>

<p>— 斯道哀着郁強譯</p>
<p>文章沒有銷路</p>
<p>這本書在一八八六年春季脫稿，七月裏出版商阿羅斯密斯原封不動的將它退回，他根本沒讀過原稿「嗅了幾嗅就跑開了」。友誼的康希爾雜誌的編輯，曾經付三十鎊的稿費錄用過道爾一篇較短的故事，覺得這本書出單行本太短，登在雜誌上嫌長。於是，它便被放置在「先進」「格德哥斯東公司」旁邊。失望的作者自己在想，或許還有其他的出版家會受騙。——剛誕生的歇洛克·福爾摩斯幾乎就此夭折。</p>
<p>華特·洛克公司收到了這破碎了的手稿，讀了一遍。於是在十月的最後一天，坐在候診室中憂郁的抽着煙的柯南·道爾醫生收到一封信：</p>
<p>「親愛的先生：</p>
<p>我們唸了你的故事，甚覺滿意。我們今年不能刋印它，因為現在廉價小說泛濫市塲，但是假如你不反對明年刋印的話，我們願出二十一鎊購買版權」。</p>
<p>即使對貧乏的柯南，道爾醫生這也算不得是動人的提議。但是經過了多次的挫折，傷了心，他終於覆信接受了。歇洛克·福爾摩斯委託給出版商，翻印者和世界了：血書的研究成了一八八七年皮頓聖誕年刋的一緝。作者在自傳中告訴我們，此後他就不從這書再收到一便士。假如它的作者能夠保留自己的名稱，由於它的屢次再版和在各地被翻印，柯南·道爾該從這冊小書中獲得可觀的收入。</p>
<p>今日，灰白紙　的一八八七年皮頓聖誕年刋已成為珍本了世界的精辨的藏書家都視之為寶石。同樣的稀罕，可能是更難覓到的，是附有作者父親卻爾斯·道爾的註解的第二版「血書的研究」。這本書是一八八八年出版的，發行者且寫了一篇簡短的序言，是一篇不合宜的修辭與比較的傑作。</p>
<p>版稅收入有限</p>
<p>當時，英國當代的文學在美國非常流行，流行的原因僅有一個簡單的理由：因為沒有版權法存在，儘可能的無代價的任意翻印。但雖然在這樣情況下，出版卻造成了許多有聲望的人。柯南·道爾也是如此出名的。在英國，「血書的研究」相當受讀書的歡迎，但卻為評論界所抨擊；可是在美國，它是毫無疑義的成功。於是，一八八九年，美國利賓考特出版公司的代理人在倫敦出現了，他是因作者的才藝而來訪問的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army in Rehe Advances to Luanping; Hebei and Rehe Routes Will Join Forces at Gubeikou; Rumors of Datong's Fall Are Absolutely Untrue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] After the National Army entered Chengde, it is now expanding outwards. A certain unit moving south has reached Luanping, and it may soon join forces with the Ping-Gu Line National Army at Gubeikou. There are still small groups of Communist troops between Gubeikou and Chengde, but they seem unable to prevent the National Army from opening the Ping-Cheng Line. The Communist troops in Chengde are retreating towards Zhaichang, but most are still near Fengning. It is also reported that the National Army in northern Hebei has advanced and today has occupied the area of Da Xiaotangshan and Jiulishan.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] The Communist troops in eastern Hebei are attempting large-scale movements and railway sabotage in order to coordinate with the Rehe campaign. The National Army has begun operations to maintain transportation. If the Hebei and Rehe National Armies join forces at Gubeikou, the Communist troops in eastern Hebei will find themselves in a large encirclement.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 1st] Xiaozhuang, between Lutai and Hangu on the Beining Railway, was attacked by more than 400 Communist troops at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The defending troops fought back and repelled them by 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Army launched a major counterattack today, carrying out a large encirclement of the Communist troops in the rectangular area around the Pingjin-Shanhaiguan area. The purpose of this move is to remove the Communist threat to the railway line between Ping and Shenyang. From a military point of view, this move is extremely necessary, as this route is the only transportation line between Guannei and the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that the National Army in Rehe is stepping up its advance. General Zheng Dongguo personally went to the front line to command the National Army's advance on Chifeng. The National Army seems to be planning to break through the outer defense line of the Communist troops south of Chifeng, and it is expected that the city will be taken soon. The Second Army of the National Army, advancing towards Zhangjiakou, has already made contact with the Communist troops north of Changping. It is also reported that there have been local clashes in the suburbs of Beiping. Gunfire can be heard in the city.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The news of the fall of Datong has been confirmed to be absolutely untrue. Today, General Ma Zhanshan still received a telegram from the defending troops of Datong stating that, apart from the three strongholds of Shaling, Zhoujiacun, and Majunying, which were abandoned by Chu Xichun's unit because they were outnumbered, the three strongholds of Caofoulou, Beiyanmiao, and the Police Academy in the east and south are still firmly defended by Chu's unit. Ma's unit is defending the northern and western areas of Datong, including the train station. At 8:30 PM on the 30th, more than 800 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on the positions of the 5th Division at the train station, attempting to destroy the water tower, but were finally repelled by the defending troops. At 11:00 PM, the Communist troops launched a fierce attack on the strongholds of the company and the Mining Bureau, but were also repelled by the defending troops. On the morning of the 31st, the Communist troops gathered their remaining troops and attacked again, but after a severe beating, they retreated towards Zimatun, Wohugou, and the Catholic Church. More than 200 Communist troops were killed in this battle. According to General Ma's headquarters, there has been no report that the Datong airfield has fallen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 31st] The spokesperson of the Jin-Sui Pacification Headquarters issued a statement on the 31st in response to the Chinese Communist Party's announcement on the radio broadcast to Madras, India, that Datong had been captured. The statement said that as of 7:00 PM on the 31st, the battles around Datong were taking place in the south at the south side of the airfield and in front of Beitaimiao, in the north to the north of the train station, in the east to the east of the Yu River, and in the west in various areas outside the West Gate, and had not yet reached the perimeter of the city.</p>
<p>Communist Offensive in Northern Jiangsu Thwarted; Situation in Rugao Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] According to the front line in Taixing: (1) The Communist offensive in Rugao has been slightly weakened, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. (2) The Communist troops attacking Huangqiao have entered the southern suburbs of the town and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. According to a military expert speaking to reporters, the Battle of Taixing will begin for the second time. (3) Hai'an is heavily besieged by the Communist troops. From the morning of yesterday to the morning of today, there has been fierce fighting for a whole day and night, and the situation is serious.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] Commander Li Mo'an and Chairman Wang Gong jointly went to Taixing yesterday to inspect and give instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Jingjiang Dispatch, 1st] Huangqiao was captured by the Communist troops at 12:00 AM on the 31st.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 1st] The outskirts of Jingjiang have become tense again in recent days. The Communist troops are attempting to sabotage the traffic on the Bagang-Jingcheng highway, hiding during the day and moving at night, with frequent small contacts occurring.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Meeting with General Rockey Completed; The 25th Group Returned to Beiping Yesterday; Visit to Sun Lianzhong Today, Departure for Zhangyuan Tomorrow <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Yesterday, a reporter accompanied the 25th Group of the Executive Headquarters, which is investigating the Anping incident, to Anping. They arrived in Tianjin that day, and due to the late hour, the group changed its plans and visited General Rockey, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, at 10:00 AM on the 1st to ask for his opinions and information on the Anping incident, and returned in the afternoon. Rockey received the group members in a rather pleasant mood, and Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, explained the purpose of the visit as chairman (the chairmanship of the group rotates among the three parties), hoping that Rockey would formally express his opinions as the American party involved. Zhang Shuheng, the government representative, expressed the government's position, stating that the government had not prevented such incidents from happening in the first place, and had been slow to reach a reasonable resolution afterwards, and expressed his apologies.</p>
<p>Key points of Rockey's on-the-spot remarks: (1) The Communist troops were prepared. (2) Don't let this affect the relationship between the two sides. (3) In the future, we will still adhere to the attitude of "we will not offend others unless we are offended." (4) There were no National Army troops traveling with us. (5) It is not clear whether the Communist troops were permanently stationed in Anping before the incident. He first said: He had recorded the reports of those who personally participated in the incident and the responsible officers of the regiments and battalions. Then he said: His Marine Corps was passing through the Pingjin Highway entirely to transport supplies to Beiping. On the day of the "729" Anping incident, the strengthening of the Marine Corps' armament was a preparation in view of the past having been shot at several times. Usually, a commander leads 25 soldiers, so on that day, the number was temporarily increased to 40 (but not including the drivers and attendants). The purpose was to protect safety and prevent bandits, but he did not expect to encounter the Communist troops' "prepared action." After the incident, according to reports, there was quite a bit of resentment from the outside, and it was hoped that this incident would not affect the feelings towards the Communist Party. He then said: I (Rockey referred to himself) have always done my best to prevent American soldiers from having problems with the Communist troops.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhang Shuheng asked, and Rockey answered: Question: Some people say that there were National Army troops traveling with you this time. Is this true? Answer: All reports indicate that there were no National Army troops traveling with us. In order to avoid this kind of malpractice, I also specifically ordered American soldiers not to be stationed in the same place as the National Army. Question: It is said that there were vehicles from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration traveling with you. How did they join the ranks of the American military vehicles? Answer: I don't know, perhaps it was for safety. Question: Some people say that there were National Army munitions in the vehicles of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration? Answer: I suspect that this is not the case.</p>
<p>The following is a question and answer session between Huang Yifeng and Rockey: Question: General, do you know if there are Communist Party troops on the Pingjin Highway? Answer: I only know that the Pingjin Highway is protected by the National Army, but I also know that there are Communist Party troops, but I don't know if they are mobile or permanently stationed. Question: Is there any contact with the Communist troops in Hebei Province? Answer: Two American soldiers were shot and injured before, and one person came saying that he was sent by the Communist Party to apologize and hoped to maintain contact, but later, when we looked for him, we could not find him. Question: Did the vehicles fly the American flag that time? Answer: I don't know. Rockey also said: He had instructed his subordinates that, except for self-defense when shot at, they were absolutely forbidden to attack people first, but the opening of fire on those who entered prohibited areas to guard bridges was not subject to this restriction. Also, after the discussion ended, the Communist Party representative requested to speak with Rockey alone for 20 minutes. The group is scheduled to visit Sun Lianzhong on the 2nd and fly to Zhangjiakou on the 3rd to visit Nie Rongzhen.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zhou Enlai Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Held a Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists on the Same Day; Explained the Attitude Toward the Reorganization of the Government <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Zhou Enlai flew to Shanghai by special plane at 9:00 AM today. It is heard that he will give instructions on the Communist Party's propaganda and internal work in Shanghai, and will also attend a press conference in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 11:00 AM yesterday. At 4:30 PM, he held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at 107 Rue Massenet, reporting the Chinese Communist Party's attitude toward the reorganization of the government. He said: "Before the informal talks of the five-person group, it is necessary to clarify the preconditions, that is, the Communist Party still insists that the government must guarantee that a ceasefire can be implemented immediately after the reorganization of the government, and the government must withdraw its five demands before negotiations can continue." Zhou also stated that if these two points cannot be resolved, the future remains extremely pessimistic. He also said: The Chinese Communist Party's acceptance of Ambassador Stuart's proposal to participate in the five-person talks this time is only "a try." In addition, he criticized the US government's sale of surplus materials, saying that it violated Truman's statement of last December and the Moscow Three-Power Agreement. He then answered questions from reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What are the Central Government's views on General Cai Wenzhi's statement yesterday?</p>
<p>Answer: I think the Central Government representative of the Executive Headquarters may have an answer.</p>
<p>Question: Ambassador Stuart proposed a five-person meeting to discuss only the issue of government reorganization, without involving other matters. Why did the Communist Party put forward two demands first?</p>
<p>Answer: Ambassador Stuart hopes to achieve peace immediately from this meeting, so he suggested that other issues not be discussed at the five-person group meeting, but this is not the attitude of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Question: Will the five-person group be the last negotiation, and what is the attitude of the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Answer: The Communist Party believes that if the government does not change its attitude in this meeting, it will be difficult to achieve results. As for whether it will be the last negotiation, it will depend on the opinions of the people.</p>
<p>Question: Will Mr. Zhou attend this meeting?</p>
<p>Answer: I haven't considered it yet.</p>
<p>Question: When will the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group be convened?</p>
<p>Answer: If a ceasefire can be implemented immediately during the five-person meeting and the government can be reorganized in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Comprehensive Group will be convened to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Question: Can the outcome of the five-person meeting represent the opinions of all parties?</p>
<p>Answer: This is an informal meeting and cannot represent the opinions of all parties. The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group will be convened in the future for further discussion.</p>
<p>Question: What will be the future if the talks are unsuccessful?</p>
<p>Answer: The future is very bleak and unimaginable.</p>
<p>Question: If the talks are unsuccessful, will the Communist Party and the government still maintain contact?</p>
<p>Answer: We have confidence that peace is still possible, because the people of the whole country want peace, and this is an irresistible force.</p>
<p>Question: When will the five-person meeting be convened?</p>
<p>Answer: According to today's evening newspaper, it will be convened on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>Question: Why is the US sale of surplus materials to China considered to be of a combat nature?</p>
<p>Answer: It can be proven both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Question: What is Mr. Zhou's observation of the current international situation?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not studied international issues recently, but I believe that no country dares to launch a third world war.</p>
<p>Question: Is it true that the Communist Party is expanding its air force and training pilots, as reported in the newspapers?</p>
<p>Answer: I only know that there are a few broken Japanese planes in "North Manchuria." As for the training of the air force, I have not heard of it.</p>
<p>Question: Has Chengde been entered by the National Army?</p>
<p>Answer: The report says so about the situation in Chengde.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] After Marshal Marshall climbed Guling for the sixth time, he was very relaxed and spent the whole day quietly at the residence yesterday, only going to the Guling Library in the morning to return borrowed books.

<h3 id="e6">Opening of the Second National Congress of the Youth League; The Chairman Personally Attended and Delivered a Training Speech; Instructed on Six Guidelines for the Development of the League's Affairs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 1st] The Second National Congress of the Youth League opened at 9:00 AM on the 1st. Chairman Jiang, in his capacity as concurrent head of the League, personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, instructing on six guidelines for the development of the League's affairs in the future. During today's meeting, all the youth representatives present contributed valuable opinions, which the head of the League greatly appreciated. A preparatory meeting was held at 11:45 AM to approve the agenda and rules of procedure, and to elect the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general of the congress and the presidium of the congress. The congress recessed in the afternoon, and the representatives divided into groups for discussion. The official meeting will be held at 8:00 AM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>The main points of Chairman Jiang's opening speech are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of the establishment of this League is to unite the youth of the whole country (to concentrate the new forces of the National Revolution in order to achieve success in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and to concretely realize the Three Principles of the People). At the First National Congress, I instructed that we should awaken the youth of the whole country, call on the whole country to actively unite, strive forward diligently, seek victory in the War of Resistance, seek happiness for our compatriots, and seek independence for the country, in order to complete our mission of revolutionary nation-building. Since the First Congress to the present, it has been three years. Thanks to the efforts and bravery of our comrades in the central government and in various regions, we have made a great contribution to the sacred War of Resistance. It can be said that the mission of striving for victory in the War of Resistance has already been achieved. The key point now is to accelerate national reconstruction in order to preserve the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(2) At the time of the last Congress, the War of Resistance was at its most intense, and the future was becoming brighter. The conclusion of the Equal New Treaty in the first month of that year opened up new opportunities for independence and freedom for China, and our China was fighting alongside the Allied nations, sharing the important task of the Far East theater of war. Internationally, our country was considered one of the four powers. The situation at that time was really exciting. At the time of this Congress, victory has been achieved for a year, but the work of restoration has encountered various obstacles and has not yet been completed. The government's hopes for peace, unity, and stability have also encountered many difficulties and have not yet been realized. The current political disputes, social disorder, the devastation of agricultural and industrial production, the suffering of the people after the disaster, the decline of moral spirit, and the loss of national self-esteem are all incomparable to the period of the War of Resistance. I once said, "The difficulty of post-war reconstruction will be ten times greater than that of wartime." Overcoming this difficulty is the responsibility of every one of our citizens, especially the undeniable responsibility of every Chinese youth.</p>
<p>(3) The nature and mission of this Congress is to thoroughly review the gains, losses, advantages, and disadvantages of the entire League's affairs in the past three years, to discover which parts have achievements, which parts do not have enough achievements, to discover what our difficulties are, and whether we have the strength to overcome these difficulties. We must also frankly and enthusiastically reflect on our shortcomings, expose our shortcomings, and study concrete ways to correct our shortcomings. Taking advantage of this opportunity to gather together, we must exchange work experiences with each other, diligently practice self-criticism and mutual criticism, in order to gather ideas and promote the future development of our League's affairs.</p>
<p>(4) In the past year, the international situation and the changes in domestic politics, from the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference to the recent Paris Peace Conference, have undergone many changes. Regardless of whether China participates or not, it has always strived to uphold human justice and realize world peace. In particular, this Paris Peace Conference is the key to the future safety and order of the world. We hope that the plan for lasting world peace can finally be realized, and the organization of the United Nations will gradually become sound. Our China must uphold the original intention of the War of Resistance and strive for international justice and peace. We should be aware of the importance of our country's international relations and must be confident that we have a stabilizing force in order to live up to the hopes of all friendly countries. As for domestic affairs, you have all personally witnessed them and do not need me to say much. As far as the current situation is concerned, there are certainly many areas that need to be improved, but compared with ten years ago, there are also many areas that have improved. Before the war, the Northeast was occupied by the Japanese, and some provinces in North China were also invaded by Japanese forces. The situation in the southwestern provinces was also quite special. Now, except for a few special areas, the central government's orders can be fully implemented. This is the foundation of national unity and is a great improvement.</p>
<p>(5) Looking at the domestic and foreign situations as a whole, as long as we can strengthen ourselves and stand on our own feet, we will surely be able to fulfill the legacy of the General. The most urgent tasks at present are: (1) complete unification; (2) accelerate national reconstruction. We should reflect on ourselves, intensify our efforts in positive aspects, and fully realize the Three Principles of the People. We must reform our shortcomings in politics, love the people, support the interests of the majority of the people, and solve economic problems based on the General's legacy of controlling capital, and deal with land problems based on the legacy of equal land rights, in order to achieve the goal of "land to the tiller." All followers of the General, whether groups or individuals, must uphold the spirit of integrity, openness, and frankness, abide by the laws and regulations, respect freedom, promote autonomy, cultivate civil rights, and establish the foundation of democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>(6) Youth is the life of the country's successors. This League was organized to unite the youth of the whole country and jointly shoulder the great cause of revolutionary nation-building. In the future, how to increase the confidence of our youth, how to relieve the boredom and suffering of our youth, how to establish an effective way for our youth to serve the country, how to enhance our youth's cultivation in knowledge, skills, and career, and truly enable our Chinese youth to strive for revolutionary nation-building is the main theme that this Congress must carefully discuss. Most importantly, we must maintain the inherent integrity and unyielding morality of our nation, promote the inherent culture of our nation, which is long-standing and extensive, emphasize propriety, know shame, be able to endure hard work, and be able to actively move forward. In the midst of the decadent and chaotic torrent that only talks about interests and does not talk about right and wrong, we must temper our upright integrity and establish the personality of self-respect and self-love among our youth in general.</p>

<p>[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 31st] Today, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (Chinese Association) hosted a banquet for General He Yingqin at the Louisville Restaurant in Chinatown, New York, from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM, lasting two and a half hours. There were 16 round tables at the banquet, seating 200 people. More than 1,000 people gathered in the streets outside, enthusiastically cheering for General He. He gave a speech on the spot, saying that if China did not have Communist troops disturbing everywhere, it could safely carry out construction work and maintain world peace in its position as one of the five powers. In the tone of a scholar, he gradually analyzed the three factors of China's victory over Japan: (1) Chairman Jiang's outstanding leadership; (2) The loyalty and bravery of Chinese soldiers and people; (3) The power of the Three Principles of the People. General He said: "The Communist troops did not destroy the railways or factories during the Japanese occupation, but now they are doing their best to destroy everything, which is a pity. This is the reason why haze is still shrouding China." He pointed out that Chairman Jiang is eager to achieve domestic peace by all means, because China's peace is the key to world peace. General He, on behalf of the National Army, expressed his gratitude to the overseas Chinese for their contributions to the War of Resistance against Japan. He encouraged the overseas Chinese to cooperate in developing the motherland's industry in order to develop China's resources. Chen Zhonghai, Chairman of the New York Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, compared Sun Yat-sen to Washington, Jiang Jieshi to Lincoln, and General He to General George Meade (a famous general during the American Civil War) for fighting bravely against the enemy and making great contributions to the country.</p>
<h3 id="e8">People's Governance Party Announces Establishment, Holds First Press Conference Yesterday, and Releases Five Propositions on the Current Situation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The newly formed People's Governance Party held its first press conference yesterday afternoon at the Hong Lok Restaurant. Among those present were Standing Committee members Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, Zhao Yu, and others. Situ Meitang gave a speech, stating that the party originally existed as a society with a history, organization, and power, with members spread across the country and overseas. The party estimates its membership to be over three million and is currently undergoing registration. The party holds a friendly attitude towards the government and all parties, hoping to be fair, sincere, and cooperative, so that it can contribute to the nation and lead China onto the path of true democracy. Subsequently, Zhao Yu rose and said that seventy years ago, the number of overseas Chinese was very small. Later, due to the failure of the Hongmen uprising, many patriots traveled overseas, thus establishing a good revolutionary foundation. During the Xinhai Revolution, the overseas Chinese contributed greatly, and during the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese compatriots also exerted great effort. Now, on the occasion of the victory of the War of Resistance, they are willing to participate in domestic politics with pure patriotic enthusiasm, aiming to strive for production and construction. Zhu Jiazhao continued: Overseas Chinese in the United States have a history of eighty years, and there are more than 300 Hongmen organizations in the United States with more than 100,000 comrades. There are also more than 500 organizations in Nanyang with more than 2.5 million comrades. They have always been concerned about the country and the nation, and have exhausted human and material resources to contribute to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, the Founding Father once called overseas Chinese "the mother of revolution." Overseas Chinese withdrew after their success and did not engage in politics. Last March, overseas Chinese of the Zhi Gong Tang established the Zhi Gong Party in the United States, originally intending to send representatives back to China to form a party as soon as possible, but this could not be realized due to traffic obstruction. After this victory, they returned to the motherland. After months of preparation, the work of forming the party was finally successful. However, the name of the party has been changed from Zhi Gong Party to People's Governance Party, with the aim of uniting comrades at home and abroad, focusing on economic construction, and creating a new China. Then, Zhang Shucheng of the party announced five points of proposition on the current situation: (1) Domestic military conflicts should be stopped immediately. Under the principle of peaceful unification, all political and military issues should be resolved as soon as possible. (2) To create a reorganized government, all parties should strive to genuinely innovate politics, and should not haggle over the distribution of quotas, delaying the realization of peace and aggravating the national crisis. (3) The reorganization of the army should be the responsibility of the state and the nation, and the reorganization committee should be organized by representatives elected by various parties to implement the army reorganization plan in earnest, in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army. (4) Disputed areas can be divided into several "New Administration Experiment Zones," where the government selects non-violent political figures to form a committee to temporarily take charge of governance. After the promulgation of the constitution, this temporary governance right should still be transferred to the democratically elected local government. (5) Any party should maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. The party opposes submitting any internal disputes to the United Nations for discussion, or requesting direct or indirect intervention from the international community.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The plan to increase import tariffs has been jointly drafted by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Finance and is currently under discussion by the Executive Yuan. It is heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs provided a list of goods for which tariffs would be increased, the Ministry of Finance suggested the amount of the tariff increase, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs drafted the final document for submission to the Executive Yuan. According to related parties, most of the goods for which tariffs will be increased are those that are not needed in large quantities and can be produced domestically. The import tariffs on some servers and machinery will not be increased. Raw materials will be determined according to their nature, and no tariffs will be imposed on cotton. The purpose of this move is more protective than financial.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The New Political Party of Overseas Compatriots <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The People's Governance Party is organized by various Hongmen groups of overseas compatriots. It held its first representative conference in Shanghai in August of this year, decided on its political program, passed its general constitution declaration, elected the persons in charge of the headquarters, and announced its establishment. It was not until yesterday that it invited reporters in Shanghai and telegraphed the whole country to officially announce its existence. This is a political association that is worth noting.</p>
<p>On the surface, this seems to be a new political party, but it is actually an old organization. As they said in their declaration, "Although the Zhou dynasty is an old state, its mandate is renewed." In Western terms, this is called "new wine in old bottles." This union should be rich in historical, revolutionary, and national characteristics. The Hongmen is a revolutionary group, aiming to restore China. It has passion, blood, and light, and has written a glorious poem in history. Whenever the times tested people's souls, they had several times saved their motherland.</p>
<p>The founders of this party, Zhao Yu, Zhu Jiazhao, Situ Meitang and others, are all overseas Chinese, and more than 70% of the party members are also overseas Chinese. There are nearly 70 units of branches scattered overseas, with 3 million party members. This party first conceived overseas and then returned to the embrace of the motherland to give birth, which clearly reflects their feelings for the motherland.</p>
<p>Our overseas compatriots, empty-handed, wander overseas, suffer all kinds of human suffering, suffer all kinds of bone-sucking, endure what others cannot endure, and live and die on their own until now. They don't blame heaven or others. They are used to this kind of life and don't think they are pitiful. The motherland does not think of them, and is even unwilling to give them the small amount of education and repatriation funds, but they miss the motherland at all times, and remit a large amount of donations to the motherland. Their patriotism is always high, like unrequited love, and they feel that everything about the motherland is good. They eagerly hope that the motherland will be strong, rich, and that the motherland will be respected in everything.</p>
<p>However, the god of victory in the War of Resistance brought a more sorrowful fate to overseas Chinese. From the shooting of our overseas compatriots in Batavia, to the Tanquilong massacre in the Dutch East Indies, the lives of overseas Chinese are still filled with tears. Looking at the motherland, it is still a mess, with a low level of political style and a low-pressure brute force struggle. One wave is not flat, and another wave rises, just like the Hydra in Greek mythology. Cut off one head and another grows. What is the sin of the nation? Seeing the fruit of victory rot, and overseas Chinese suffer even more indirectly.</p>
<p>Overseas compatriots hope that the motherland will be like waiting for dawn in the dark night. However, the motherland has long nights and many dreams. It says peace but there is no peace, it says not to fight but there is fighting. If it drags on like this, it will drag the people to death, drag down the country, and drag down the overseas Chinese. In this situation, even a mute will speak. Under the command of their high-spirited patriotism, overseas Chinese can no longer silently endure. They spontaneously organize political parties, participate in national affairs, and want to roar loudly.</p>
<p>They have bright political programs and remedies for ills in politics, military affairs, diplomacy, economics, culture, education, and so on. Their political mission is to "revive the nation and stabilize the country," which was originally their traditional mission for three hundred years. Today, they will promote the glorious history of the past in a new posture and promote the Republic of China to embark on the path of democracy, governance by the people, and service for the people. They have put forward five points of national propositions: first, peaceful unification; second, reorganization of the government; third, nationalization of the army; fourth, establishment of "New Administration Experiment Zones"; fifth, maintaining the freedom and independence of the nation.</p>
<p>Among these five national propositions, the first point says that peaceful unification should be realized according to public opinion. The four words "according to public opinion" are excellent. The current crux of the matter is the lack of sincerity. If public opinion is relied upon, there will be sincerity. With sincerity, there can be peace, and with sincerity, there can be unification. Because now the common people are sincerely praying for peaceful unification day and night. The second point, reorganizing the government, focuses on "electing the virtuous and capable," and the common people will definitely raise their hands in approval. People are the foundation of nation-building. Confusion can cause a government to die without illness; incompetence can make a government a target of revolution. We cannot get red-faced and angry, arguing over the number of seats. We must put talent first. Only with first-class talent can there be a first-class government and a first-class country. The "New Administration Experiment Zone" is an interesting thing. If everyone agrees, the disputed area may not be difficult to resolve. As for the nationalization of the army and the fact that all parties must not seek foreign forces to infringe on the freedom and independence of the country, that is even more a matter of course.</p>
<p>Looking at the text of this party, listening to the words of this party, tracing the history of this party, and carefully examining the members of this party, we can believe that they are frank and selfless, and can be said to be purely nationalistic, purely patriotic, and purely objective, standing on the position of the common people. However, what we are now worried about and also what we expect from them is that they will always stand their ground and speak and act from the solemn position of the common people. Because overseas Chinese are emotional and sincere, and are separated from the motherland, they are easily misled by their intuition and have their rights and wrongs confused. This needs to be guarded against and treated with utmost caution. We also hope that all their activities are for the country and all their interests are for the country!</p>
<h3 id="e28">America Aids Our National Reconstruction <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations between China and the United States regarding the specific methods for the U.S. to sell surplus materials to China have concluded. Despite the clamor and protests from the Chinese Communist Party, an agreement between the two countries was finally signed the day before yesterday. China, having suffered the sacrifices and depletion of eight years of war against Japan, is in a state of great devastation. Post-war recovery and national reconstruction require a substantial replenishment of resources. This time, the United States' sale of a large quantity of surplus materials to China will be of immense benefit to the stability of China's economy and the progress of national reconstruction. We should redouble our efforts to make the most of this substantial amount of supplies and lay a solid foundation for the future of our nation.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of this agreement, the surplus materials sold by the United States to China are very substantial, with an original total value of over 800 million US dollars. This includes: (1) Scattered liquid assets in China, Okinawa, Guam, Bataan, and other islands, originally valued at 500 million US dollars; (2) Fixed assets within China, originally valued at 85 million US dollars; (3) Other surplus materials worth 130 million US dollars; (4) Small ships with an original cost value of 90 million US dollars; (5) Surplus materials stored in western China, originally valued at 20 million US dollars; (6) Shipping costs for surplus materials, approximately 30 million US dollars. The total amounts to 855 million US dollars. As for what the United States receives, it will only offset 74 million US dollars in debts owed by China, obtain 35 million US dollars in funding for the U.S. embassy in China, and allocate 20 million US dollars for promoting Sino-American cultural and educational endeavors. The remaining balance will be considered a loan from the United States to China. This cannot be seen as anything other than a further expression of American goodwill toward China. Moreover, the United States is willing to provide a high degree of cooperation in how these materials are transported to China, and must complete the work within 22 months.</p>
<p>During the war, China and the United States fought side-by-side and had long become allies in adversity. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries, having been tempered by bloodshed, has become even deeper and cannot be alienated by any propaganda offensive. The 450 million people of the country are grateful for the kind assistance of the United States and harbor no doubts about any ulterior motives. Even if we sometimes ask ourselves why the United States is willing to sell so many materials to China, it is easy to find an answer. The United States hopes that China will become a strong, unified, and democratic nation, and China's most pressing need at present is the supply of materials. If foreign aid is not obtained, not only will national reconstruction be impossible to initiate, but also domestic resources will be exhausted, and it will be impossible to avoid inflation. This is the first reason. The United States' policy towards China is entirely focused on commercial and economic interests. If the United States wants to do business in China, it must ensure China's security and prosperity. Post-war China, because everything has not yet recovered, is like a patient suffering from anemia. The only way to treat it is to use blood transfusions to restore it first, and then there is hope of becoming strong. This is the second reason. During the war, American troops were scattered all over the world, so there were surplus materials on every battlefield. If these are not sold, it will be detrimental to the United States. It is better to sell them. In the European theater, most of the surplus materials, except for a portion sold to Britain, were sold to France, and the approach taken was generally the same. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>The United States has specifically stated that these surplus materials do not include military equipment, ammunition, aircraft, or other military equipment, but are entirely civilian materials, all of which are necessary for our country's recovery and national reconstruction. Therefore, it is expected that after this "blood transfusion," if we take this as a starting point, work hard to transform other people's blood into our own new flesh and blood, then a bright future will surely unfold in front of China's recovery and national reconstruction. In the history of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the signing and implementation of this agreement will undoubtedly usher in a more glorious chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Greek Citizens to Vote on Form of Government - UK, US, and USSR Watching Closely - Monarchist Tendencies Quite Strong - Terrorists Causing Trouble Throughout <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Consolidated News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: Greece held a referendum today to decide whether the country would be ruled by the monarchy or a republican government. At dawn, large numbers of Athens voters gathered at the polling stations. According to government estimates, roughly 85-90% of the country's 1.7 million eligible voters will participate in the vote. Ballots are divided into two types, one bearing the name "George" and the other bearing the name "Democracy." The movement to restore the monarchy appears quite strong. Last night in Athens, members of the National Liberation Front party drove trucks through the streets, urging people to vote for "Democracy," while monarchists also made fervent pronouncements, using bugles to sound "Da Da Di Di Di." The sound symbolizes the phrase "he will return" in Greek. Police were stationed at key points in the city to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: This morning, 40 armed terrorists in Chelsea Deauk attempted to block the voting process, but were eventually dispersed by the Gendarmes. No incidents occurred during the referendum in the Peloponnese region.</p>
<p>London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: This morning in Athens's Kasariani district, a right-wing individual was killed by a thrown explosive of unknown origin, while another communist leader was shot dead.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Athens on the 31st, the government announced on the eve of the Greek referendum that recent clashes between royalists and communists over the past 48 hours have resulted in 31 deaths. Communists killed 10 soldiers and civilians in recent attacks.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 31st, well-informed observers anticipate that the Greek referendum will result in a majority vote in favor of King George's return. It is reported that Greek guerrillas are receiving large quantities of arms and ammunition from Albania, and volunteer soldiers from Albania and Yugoslavia have pledged assistance. Therefore, it is expected that if the referendum results in favor of the monarchy, large-scale unrest will be inevitable. US diplomats believe that Greece is the "vanguard" of the Soviet Union's "Dardanelles offensive." The pressure exerted by the Eastern European bloc on Greece, such as recalling ambassadors, filing complaints with the Security Council, and demanding border adjustments at the Paris Peace Conference, has fully exposed the face of pure power politics. In the context of this referendum, the Soviet Union's strategy is well-suited to make the general Greek population understand that only by establishing a monarchy can national independence be maintained; otherwise, Greece under a communist government will fall completely under Soviet control. US officials candidly acknowledge that the core of the Greek problem lies in controlling the Dardanelles. Greece is the only country in the Balkan Peninsula not under Soviet influence, and therefore, US foreign policy is paying the utmost attention to the Greek issue.</p>

<p>[United Press, Naples, 31st] The largest US aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt, will arrive in Greek waters on September 5th, four days after the Greek referendum to decide on the restoration of King George II. It will dispatch 125 aircraft to soar over Athens. According to Rear Admiral Cassady's announcement today, this aerial display will be carried out at the request of the Greek government and will last for approximately 30 minutes. The aircraft will spell out the letters "FDR" in the sky. Cassady is the commander of the US Navy's mobile force, and its Mediterranean cruise has drawn criticism from Moscow.

<p>[Report from Our News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, originally scheduled to resume tomorrow, has been postponed due to Molotov's sudden return to Moscow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] There are two rumors circulating here regarding Molotov's sudden departure from Paris to return home. One is that Molotov's trip is similar to Bevin's frequent weekend trips home during the foreign ministers' conference in April, as Molotov has not had direct contact with his government for over a month. The other is that Molotov's trip is a result of the diplomatic conflict between the Soviet Union and Greece and Western countries. During yesterday's plenary session of the peace conference, Molotov and British representative Alexander clashed over whether the foreign ministers' conference should discuss the Greek-Albanian border issue. The two theories are clearly mutually exclusive, but we can be certain that Molotov's return home is to seek instructions on diplomatic policy toward Greece. With Ukraine's accusation against Greece under discussion by the Security Council, Greece's demand for land from Albania on the peace conference's agenda, and the Greek referendum about to take place, the Greek issue has become the most attention-grabbing issue of the day. From the perspective of Soviet policy over the past week, the London Observer believes that the Greek referendum may trigger a crisis in Soviet diplomatic policy toward Greece. If the referendum result establishes a monarchy, the Soviet Union will have to put considerable effort into deciding what attitude to take, which is why Molotov returned home.</p>

<p>[United Press, Manila, Day 1] Local Sunday newspapers report that military police have received reinforcements and have recently used artillery, guided by reconnaissance aircraft, to bombard strongholds of the Hukbalahap peasant guerrillas. The fighting is most intense within the San Fernando-San Miguel and Cabanatuan triangle areas. It is reported that a large number of Hukbalahap have concentrated in the Arayat Mountains in Pampanga Province, but the military police have not yet approached the mountains. The situation throughout the provinces of Central Luzon is volatile because the Hukbalahap have adopted guerrilla tactics and do not hold fixed lines. Congressman Consunji, under heavy escort, arrived in Cabanatuan, saying that he carried a secret order from Roxas. This trip appears to be a last-minute effort to contact the leaders of the Hukbalahap in order to avoid widespread bloodshed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 31st] The new Republic of the Philippines faces a major test as an independent nation. Today, President Roxas sent a strongly worded letter to Hukbalahap leader Taruc, criticizing him for abandoning and undermining the pacification plan. Roxas had previously received a letter from Taruc, declaring that his subordinates would resist the disarmament order, hence this warning. He also announced that the government will confiscate all unlicensed firearms starting Monday and will prevent unauthorized gatherings of armed personnel.</p>

<p>[Report from Our News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: India's interim government is scheduled to be established tomorrow, with Nehru and a dozen others holding an inauguration ceremony. However, on the eve of this important event, riots broke out again in Bombay and other places today, resulting in over 50 deaths and injuries, as well as incidents of looting and arson.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] On the eve of the inauguration of India's interim government, Nehru stated in a speech: "The new government of India must pay close attention to international events and adopt an independent policy consistent with its own national interests. We fully agree to recognize the Republic of Indonesia. India and the United States should cooperate economically and agriculturally to improve the living standards of Indians. In the past, Britain did not allow India to interact directly with other countries, so there was no opportunity for development. India should fully participate in world affairs, which will certainly contribute to world peace and the establishment of freedom. Although we are busy with domestic affairs, we must pay close attention to international events. This is what we are willing to do, and at the same time, no country can afford to ignore international developments. I am not yet in a position to elaborate on India's foreign policy, but the principles I stated in March remain largely unchanged. Of course, India should be closer to countries that support its independence. India's general policy is naturally to promote peace, prevent aggression, and assist the people of Asia and Africa in gaining freedom as much as possible. We are willing to maintain friendly relations with the three great powers on a basis of complete freedom. Regarding China, although we are not in a position to interfere in the internal affairs of others, we sincerely welcome the unity and establishment of democracy in China."</p>

<p>[United Press, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 31st] Former US Ambassador to China, Major General Hurley, stated today: "Since the Yalta Conference, no country has created such a lamentable and cowardly record of compromise as the United States." Hurley, now a Republican candidate for senator, is running against New Mexico's Democratic Senator Chavez. Chavez has accepted the foreign situation as a campaign topic. Hurley continued, "The Atlantic Charter stipulates that the Allies will never seek to expand territory or otherwise, but our State Department allowed the Soviet Union to acquire Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, part of Finland, half of Poland, and control over Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and part of Germany, making the Soviet Union the strongest nation in Europe. "Our representatives at the Yalta Conference again compromised with the Soviet Union, giving it half of Sakhalin Island, all of the Kuril Islands, control of half of Korea, and the right to enter China's Northeast Provinces and Inner Mongolia. We are now rapidly compromising with the Soviet Union, giving it control over China, making the Soviet Union the strongest nation in Asia."</p>
<p>Declaring Goals - Dispelling Doubts</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Former US War Production Board Director Nelson today, in his personal capacity, called on Stalin for peace, requesting the development of trade and a full explanation of policies and goals. Nelson, at the request of President Truman, is currently studying military plans. His appeal was made in writing and conveyed to Stalin through the Soviet Embassy. Nelson proposed sending a US commercial delegation to the Soviet Union (Nelson discussed this with Stalin during his wartime visit to Moscow), studying the Soviet Union's needs, and drafting payment methods for necessary exchanges as needed, and developing trade on an unprecedented scale. Nelson recalled his conversation with Stalin, saying, "The clash between two major countries that have never fought each other is the most devastating thing that can happen. I believe we share this view. The fate of humanity truly depends on the continued friendship and cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union." Nelson also told Stalin that Americans do not understand the goals of Soviet policy and suspect that these goals are not being openly explained.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st] The US Congressional Library released a report today stating that Stalin has ordered the Soviet industry and scientific community to dedicate all efforts over the next 25 years to build a military force "that can rival the current power of the United States." The report stated that Stalin believes that future conflict will inevitably erupt, so it is necessary to protect the Soviet Union and deal with "all possible events." By 1970, the Soviet Union will have 32 million young people aged 20 to 29 suitable for combat, while the United States will have only 10.5 million. The Soviet Union is now paying special attention to research on atomic energy in order to catch up with Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>Only Three Can Avoid the Gallows</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 31st] The trial of 21 German war criminals concluded today, with 12 believed to be sentenced to hanging, three likely to avoid the gallows, and six hoping to do so. German defense attorneys told reporters that Nazi financier Schacht and elderly diplomat Neurath, and Papen hope to receive clemency. Former submarine commander Doenitz, former naval commander Raeder, former army chief of staff Keitel, former Vienna Governor Shirach, former propaganda director Fritsche, and Jewish abuser Streicher hope for a suspended sentence. But ____ repeatedly predicted that he would be hanged. A German lawyer said: "The only hope lies in two possibilities: the clemency of the United Nations Control Council in Berlin, which has the power to review judgments, or political considerations that could influence the judgment on naval officers." Some lawyers believe that the judges may consult with their respective governments on some of the issues.</p>

<p>Journalists' Day: A Commemoration of Two Emotions</p>
<h3 id="e51">Joyfully Celebrating the Festive Day; Mournfully Lamenting the Martyrs; Minister Peng and Mayor Wu Attended the Commemorative Meeting and Delivered Speeches; Thirteen Deceased Colleagues Received Memorial Certificates <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second "September 1st" Journalists' Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Journalists and news practitioners in this city celebrated enthusiastically. In addition to the Field Reporters Association, which held a pre-celebration party the night before, the Journalists' Association held a commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department and Mayor Wu attended the meeting. Over two hundred reporters from various newspapers attended. The auditorium was decorated with red and green colored silks, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious and pleasant. The meeting began at 11:00 AM, chaired by the Executive Directors and Supervisors of the Association: Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo, Chen Xunxun, Zhan Wenhuan, Ma Shuli, Yuan Yeyu, Xu Zhucheng, Wang Jinqi, etc. Feng Youzhen, as Chairman of the Presidium, led the salute and delivered the opening remarks, stating: Today is the first Journalists' Day after the victory. We are very excited and very touched. In the past eight years under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, our colleagues in the Shanghai press, in order to fight for national freedom and national survival, did not hesitate to brave dangers and make sacrifices. Every word and sentence was controlled by the enemy and puppets. Many martyrs followed one another, undaunted. Their loyalty, bravery, and heroic spirit are truly excellent models for us. In the year since the victory, the Chinese press has undergone tremendous changes, and the goal of freedom of speech has been achieved. Therefore, I have two feelings: (1) Our press has the responsibility of leading society. Now that the goal of freedom of speech has been achieved, all reports in the future must be detailed and accurate. We must not listen to hearsay and record everything we hear, but we must have a sense of responsibility. (2) Many countries around the world have recovered after the war, and even Japan has embarked on the road to recovery. However, our country, as one of the four powers, is still in turmoil. We should work harder to lead the people onto the road of peace, unity, construction, and progress. Regarding partisan strife, we must distinguish right from wrong, and with the spirit of fighting for national freedom and national survival in the past, lead society and complete the important task of national construction.</p>

<p>The Journalists' Association held a memorial service at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 AM this morning to commemorate the loyal and heroic spirit of the members of the Shanghai press who sacrificed their lives for the country during the Anti-Japanese War.

<h3 id="e53">Journalists Bear Significant Responsibility During the Constitutional Period <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Following this, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department delivered a speech, stating: After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we are able to hold the Journalists' Day celebration in Shanghai today. This is the result of the wise leadership of the supreme leader and the sacrifice and struggle of the military and civilians throughout the country. The grand plan for the next century will focus on national construction. The government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 2nd, promulgate the Constitution, and implement constitutional governance. All major national plans will be decided by the people. Government officials must be honest and abide by the law. The military will be solely responsible for protecting the country and must not interfere in politics. The safety of the country is the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the press has a greater responsibility to lead society during the constitutional period. All reports should be authentic and should have an objective and fair attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Pay Attention to Social Morality; Assist in the Implementation of Municipal Affairs <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: I have two hopes for the press as I participate in the Journalists' Day celebration today: (1) Pay attention to social morality and report as much as possible on news that promotes good and hides evil. For example, the charitable deeds of Mr. Gu Qianlin, the host of the Shu-Ping Scholarship, should be publicized and encouraged. (2) Whenever a problem arises, detailed records should be taken to provide the government with great assistance. Regarding the strict crackdown on theft at the docks and the banning of street vendors, Wu said that if the public opinion believes that the facts require it, then consistent publicity will provide great help in the implementation of laws.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Memorial Certificates Awarded to Deceased Colleagues at the Meeting <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Following this, honorary memorial certificates were awarded to the deceased colleagues during the Anti-Japanese War. First, Feng Youzhen reported that the colleagues in our press who were brutally murdered during the enemy's occupation of Shanghai would be commemorated at a meeting in two days. The Association specially awarded honorary memorial certificates to the colleagues who were arrested and subjected to torture, to express , Wang Kun, Wang Peiyuan, Gu Zhiwu, Wu Chengde, Shao Xiehua, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Cangping, Gu Junyuan, Jiao Chao, Gao Jilin, and Yan Guili. After the report, Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Cangbo, the Executive Supervisors of the Journalists' Association, presented the awards. Finally, two motions submitted by the Association were passed: (1) To pay tribute to President Chiang, the full text of the telegram is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e56">Respectfully Telegram to the President <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>To President Chiang of the National Government: The country is in distress after the war, and the people are impoverished. Thanks to your wise leadership, peace will surely return to the country, and construction will begin. Your grand plans are admired by all. On the occasion of the Journalists' Day, we respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We respectfully ask for your attention. The Shanghai Journalists' Association and all members of the press kowtow. (2) To request the National Government to commend the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died during the Anti-Japanese War and to provide compensation to their families.</p>
<p>An ad hoc motion: On July 1, 1940, the puppet organization Wang Jingwei issued arrest warrants for 83 key figures in Shanghai from the Party, government, military, industry, commerce, culture, and press who adhered to the national policy of resisting Japan. Twenty-seven of them were from the press. Except for Comrades Zhu Xinggong, Jin Huating, and Zhang Sixu, who were killed, and one or two who were unclear about their attitude, the remaining comrades either went to Chongqing, disguised themselves and went abroad, lived in seclusion, stood their ground, or were captured and imprisoned, enduring all kinds of humiliation. Their spirit of hard struggle, loyalty, and unwavering commitment should be commended by the Central Government through the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly, and medals should be awarded to encourage them. The General Assembly adjourned at about 12:00 PM after playing music and completing the ceremony. In the evening at 7:00 PM, a garden party was held at the Nanhai Garden on Nanjing West Road, with dinner and entertainment such as games and raffles. About 500 colleagues from various newspapers participated, making it an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>

<p>In order to improve the situation of congestion of ships in the port of this city and to organize the order of loading and unloading materials at the various wharves along the river, the Executive Yuan ordered the Municipal Government of this city and the Ministry of Communications to be responsible for establishing the Shanghai Port Committee to specifically handle the import of ships, the unloading of goods at the wharves, and the clearing of warehouses, and ordered Mayor Wu to concurrently serve as the chairman. Since the order arrived, Mayor Wu immediately planned to convene various agencies such as the Dredging Bureau, Police Bureau, Garrison Headquarters, Jianghai Customs, and the Ministry of Communications to organize and establish the committee. However, the list of representatives nominated by the various agencies of the Ministry of Communications has not yet been delivered. Chairman Wu believes that the port situation urgently needs to be improved and that it is difficult to delay further. Therefore, it was decided that today, representatives from the participating agencies would be convened to hold the first meeting, with the aim of organizing and establishing the committee in the near future to be responsible for improving the efficiency of material transportation, so that imported ships would not be detained for a long time.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of the financial authorities of this city, the reporter of Datong News Agency was informed that due to the hot weather this month, the business of entertainment venues has sharply decreased, resulting in a decrease in the entertainment tax, which accounts for a large part of the tax revenue of this city, compared to last month. The expenditure department has increased more sharply than last month. The business tax allocated by the central government to this city for collection was originally scheduled to be transferred to local collection on September 1, but it was not transferred by the Direct Tax Bureau yesterday. It is reported that the Direct Tax Bureau has not yet received orders from the central government.</p>

<p>Eleven members of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, after inspecting various American-held islands in the Pacific, arrived in China in two batches. The first batch of six members was originally scheduled to arrive in China the day before yesterday, but due to bad weather, they arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Korea at 4:30 PM yesterday, landing at Jiangwan Airport. The second batch of five members will also arrive here at 6:00 AM tomorrow morning. After the six congressmen who arrived in Shanghai deplaned, they were entertained at a cocktail party by US Consul General in Shanghai Davis. In the evening, they were feted by General Gillen, the commander of the US forces stationed in Shanghai, and Ambassador Stuart, who recently arrived in Shanghai, was also present. This morning, they will inspect the US troops stationed in China and have important discussions with senior officials of the US military headquarters in Shanghai. At noon, they will be hosted at lunch by Mayor Wu, and in the evening, they will be hosted at dinner by President Song Ziwen. Because the congressmen arrived in Shanghai one day later than the scheduled itinerary, the work procedures have been slightly changed. After all eleven members have arrived in Shanghai and completed their work, they will fly to Beijing to visit President Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall for important discussions. They will then travel to Beiping for sightseeing and leave China around the 6th or 7th of this month to fly to Tokyo and return to the United States. They will make a report on their observations in China.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Universal Good Harvest Nationwide; Ample Grain Reserves in This City; Minister Xu is Optimistic About the Future of Grain <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>This reporter visited Xu Kan, Minister of Food, who arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month, to inquire about the current grain policy measures. Mr. Xu first stated that this year's nationwide harvest is universally good, especially in Sichuan Province. There is no need to worry about food shortages for the people, which can symbolize a peaceful scene. As the saying goes, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace." Food is the most important thing for the people. Ample grain is a great help in both politics and construction. As for the grain reserves in this city, they have always been extremely abundant. During the period of grain shortage, early preparations were made, and foreign rice was ordered and imported successively. Soon, another 50,000 tons of Annam rice and 30,000 tons of Siam rice will be imported. Moreover, the new grains of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are gradually appearing on the market, and the grain price will definitely not rise, and there is even a downward trend. Regarding the problem of the Communist Party controlling the grain-producing areas in North China and the South trying to help the people in various places, Mr. Xu said: This is a natural fact. However, the people in the North mainly eat flour, and the scope of exports is limited to wheat and sorghum. Mr. Xu further elaborated that the collection of actual grain in various provinces and counties is being carried out successively in accordance with the established national policy, and the situation is very good. The government has formulated reduction and exemption regulations for disaster-stricken areas to show concern for the hardships of farmers and ordered them to be followed. Wartime grain loans are also repaid with principal and interest annually in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Liang Jingzhong Discusses the Grain Situation in the Northeast <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to Liang Jingzhong, the Special Commissioner for Grain Administration in the Northeast who returned to Shanghai last week, he was ordered to go to the Northeast again from Beiping in March of this year to handle grain administration facilities in Liaoning, Liaobei, and Jilin provinces and successively went to various places for inspection, lasting for five months. The above-mentioned places are nominally three provinces, but in reality, there are only forty counties. The common crop is sorghum, followed by millet, barley, and rice in fourth place. Rice was not grown in the past. During the Japanese occupation, water and electricity were used to develop rice paddies and increase rice production. On the one hand, Korean people were relocated to promote planting. However, the local sorghum and millet have bumper harvests every year, and there is no problem with the people's food supply. There is also a surplus to be transported to North China for assistance. Recently, the Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group went to the Northeast for inspection. In response to the actual needs of various places, they have formulated a detailed plan for improving agricultural implements and seeds in the future. Once approved by the Sino-US government, it will be implemented. In the future, it will be of great benefit to the improvement of agricultural products in the Northeast. Mr. Liang said that the Japanese had an aggressive ambition to develop the eastern provinces in the past. The Xiaofengman Power Plant, the source of the Songhua River, is a clear example. The equipment in this plant is the best in East Asia and is enough to make the Northeast harvest abundant crops, and electricity is supplied to factories throughout the territory. In the future, when the political situation in our country is clear and various aspects enter a normal track, it is urgent to use this kind of equipment, and the harvest will be inestimable. Moreover, the people in the Northeast have a simple and honest style, the soil is fertile, the living standards are not high, and the factories are complete, which is enough to be a prelude to brightness. Mr. Liang added that soybeans are also a famous product, and exports to the United States and Canada were very large before the war. At present, soybean cake is only worth 10 yuan in circulating currency per catty, which is equivalent to 130 yuan in national currency. On the 15th of last month, it was approved for export by the Economic Commission. Such measures will increase the fertilizer for crops in Taiwan Province and increase the income of local farmers. As for the grain processing plants in the area, there are about 2,000 small-scale ones, which are regularly put into operation. The five larger-scale ones have been sold first in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan. Regarding the progress of the collection of actual grain, Mr. Liang said that due to climatic reasons, the autumn harvest is later than in the Jiangnan area and will only begin to be promoted around November. Mr. Liang's return south this time is specifically to report to the Ministry, and he will have to return north in a week.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Soldiers Have Dispute on the Bus; Ticket Seller Is Detained <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The French-operated Route 18 trolleybus was traveling from the Great World to the Xieqiao area at 7:30 PM last night. When it reached the Jinling Road intersection, the traffic light was red, so the driver stopped there temporarily. At that time, the Golden Grand Theater was just letting out, and twelve sailors came out and wanted to take the trolleybus. However, the ticket seller, Liang Guanghui, refused, saying that opening the iron door halfway was a violation of regulations. Who would have thought that these soldiers would climb in through the windows, and the two sides had an argument. When the trolleybus reached the intersection of Kangti Road and Father Du Road, the soldiers and the ticket seller started arguing again and almost clashed. Passengers intervened to stop them. But when the trolleybus arrived at the terminal, all the passengers got off the bus, and the soldiers dragged the ticket seller Mr. Liang off the bus and took him to the Nanshi area, and his whereabouts are unknown. Subsequently, another ticket seller reported the incident to the local police station, describing the incident in detail. The police dispatched personnel to investigate separately and found that the ticket seller had been detained in the naval training camp at the original site of the Jiangnan Shipyard. After receiving the news, the French trolleybus workers were outraged. The authorities are currently investigating the responsibility for the conflict.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Shanghai's Firefighting Work is Constantly Improving; Many People Enthusiastically Apply to Become Firefighters <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Fire Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau, this city currently has about 700 firefighters, most of whom are experienced, and some have even served for 20 to 30 years. Because these personnel are insufficient, two open recruitment drives have been carried out successively, and they have been assigned to work in various districts. This recruitment is the third phase, and the number of applicants is extremely enthusiastic. Since the advertisement was published on the 26th, about 100 people have been going to the department to register every day, and some even come from Hangzhou. The criteria for admission are based on physical strength as a prerequisite, stipulating that the height is above 5 feet 5 inches, the weight is above 60 kilograms, and the age is 20 to 25 years old. Unmarried persons with a junior high school education or equivalent are qualified. After registration, the applicant must first be examined by the police hospital. After passing the examination, they must also test their physical strength and arm strength, such as weightlifting and rope climbing. Only after passing all the tests can they participate in the written test. After being admitted, they must enter the Fire Department training class for a period of three months, mainly to teach basic firefighting techniques, such as the use of different ladders. After the training period, those with good results will be allowed to be assigned to various fire brigades to practice at the fire scene, but it is stipulated that they are not allowed to leave their jobs within one year, otherwise they must compensate all the costs of their training period.</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the department currently has the following number of vehicles: a total of 39 fire trucks, one heavy truck, one ambulance, seven hospital vehicles, two lighting vehicles, and six fire hydrant inspection vehicles.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the department also said: Firefighting work is different from other jobs. Firefighters must be prepared to depart day and night and must risk their lives. At present, their treatment is the same as that of civil servants. Because the cost of living is currently high, many people have recently resigned. If this phenomenon continues to occur, it is really worrying.</p>
<p>The only difficulty they currently feel in their work is that the fire hydrants are damaged from time to time. The reason for this is that citizens who are greedy for small gains often steal water without permission and do not turn it off afterward. And some naughty children put stones into the hydrants, causing them to be damaged. When they are needed, there is no water to release. During the fire on Huade Road, the surrounding hydrants were all damaged, and the water hose was extended to 1,300 feet. Therefore, in addition to sending fire hydrant inspection vehicles to various places every day for strict inspection, the department also hopes that citizens can cooperate closely and should deeply understand that the fire hydrants near their homes are also a guarantee for their own lives and property and must be carefully protected.</p>
<p>In order to improve the firefighting work, the department is planning to order several of the latest fire trucks from the United States.

<p>[Our Correspondent] The Huangpu Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau reported yesterday at 10:00 AM, based on a report from traffic police officer number 701 in West, that a box of hand grenades had been found at the Bund on Gold Coins Road. The bureau reported the matter to the Huangpu District Military Police, who immediately dispatched two military police officers accompanied by police officers to the Bund to investigate. They found a rectangular red iron box, about one inch high, at Wharf No. 1 on the riverfront. Six police officers had already temporarily cordoned off the area. After the military police opened the iron box, they found twelve slender wooden-handled grenades, wrapped in oiled paper. Each grenade was marked with red flame numbers and had several Japanese characters at the bottom. A wire with a small copper ring, presumably a "pull ring," was attached to the side of the grenade. However, they were slightly different from other wooden-handled hand grenades. The box of hand grenades was then transported to the armory of the military police headquarters for safekeeping. An investigation is underway to determine the source of the firearms.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Speculation Failure Leads to Suicide - Indian Man Hangs Himself <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] An Indian man named Mao Taibaike Kesa, 32 years old, who was the Deputy Manager of Xiangji Foreign Firm located at 671 Sichuan Road, took on the position after the outbreak of the Pacific War. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, he suddenly sent the store clerk, Qu Axing, out on an errand under the pretext of delivering something. Mao then hanged himself on the balcony of the foreign firm's second floor. When Qu returned to the firm, he searched everywhere for Mao but could not find him. When he went to the balcony, he was shocked to see what had happened and immediately reported it to the Huangpu Branch. Zhou Guanghui, the Chief of the Criminal Division, immediately ordered divisional members Song Yuanshan, Qian Sun, and Yi Hai to rush to the scene for investigation. They found that Mao was already dead. Qu Axing was taken to the bureau for questioning. He said that he had been working at the firm for 31 years. At 4:00 PM today, the British Manager of the firm returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They had originally agreed to meet him together, but unexpectedly, Mao committed suicide. It is reported that the Indian man had engaged in speculative trading and embezzled public funds, resulting in excessive losses. When he suddenly heard that the British Manager was coming to Shanghai, he feared that the matter would be exposed, and therefore took this final path.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Guardians of Navigation Safety - A Chat About Pilots <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] In the water transport sector, there is a profession called "pilot" or "water guide." Their position can be said to be the shipowner's advisor, and their task is to guide the ship's course when it enters a port or sails a waterway, avoiding all obstacles and dangers. Because each port or waterway has its own special conditions, and these are constantly changing, this situation may not be familiar to the shipowner. In order to ensure safety, it is necessary to hire a "veteran" pilot to guide the way.</p>
<p>Shanghai, as a large metropolis, has many ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River every day, so the business of "piloting" is naturally more developed. Since September of last year, this industry has undergone a great transformation. At the beginning of the victory, because the first to arrive in Shanghai were the American Navy, the task of "piloting" was entirely undertaken by them. Later, everything slowly returned to normal, and it was taken over by the Chinese people, managed and controlled by the trade association. Before the war, the government had a management agency for pilots under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. After the victory, it was reorganized into the National Water Guide Management Committee, which was transferred to the Ministry of Transportation. Due to the difficulties of transportation recovery, the Shanghai office was not established until April of this year, and after considerable twists and turns, it took over the management rights from the trade association. However, the pilot industry in Shanghai is currently divided into three categories: first, the piloting of ocean-going vessels, which is managed by the customs, with a total of 22 people, only two of whom are Chinese. Their work area is from the Bund to the Wusongkou. Second, the short-term piloting of inland river routes, which is managed by the Water Guide Committee, with a total of more than 100 people, all of whom are Chinese. Their work area is from Shanghai to Hankou. Third, the long-term piloting, which is directly hired by the shipping company with long-term contracts, totaling about 50 people.</p>
<p>Except for those with long-term contracts, the income of the pilots is collected monthly by the主管部门主管當局 in proportion, based on the size of the ship they piloted. Currently, the income of ocean-going vessel pilots is about 700 US dollars per month. The income of inland river pilots is much lower. The Water Guide Committee stipulates a monthly subsidy of 70,000 yuan, plus 20,000 yuan for each business trip, and an additional 100,000 yuan for dispatching naval vessels. In addition, the total monthly income is also distributed in proportion. It is said that the monthly income per person is not very good, only about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Most of the pilots are from boatswain or have been captains. The licenses issued by the customs in the past are still valid. For those who have not received a license, the Water Guide Management Committee will hold an examination in the near future to assess their abilities and issue licenses. The qualification requires at least two years of experience as a captain or seven years of experience as a boatswain. The subjects of the examination, in addition to Chinese and English, focus on waterways, followed by customs collision avoidance skills. If they fail the exam, they will still be given the opportunity to practice. As for the training of new talents, there are no specific plans yet.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday was the first day of enforcing the ban on American goods stalls. The reporter visited the Xikou Road (Zhu Baosan Road) area and found the situation to be very good. All stalls had complied with the order to cease operations. A large team of police officers patrolled the area in the morning, but soon withdrew. Empty cans, garbage, and other debris scattered on the ground were also cleaned up by street sweepers. There were few pedestrians on the road, and the scene was desolate. Only a few vendors who had been banned were gathered in groups of three or five, discussing the matter. Some said, "This ban was initiated by those big companies," expressing their indignation. Others said, "Today is the first day, of course we have to give the mayor some face. Let's see what happens later. When our stomachs can't take it anymore, we'll just break up into smaller units and secretly set up shop elsewhere." Some also believe that the municipal government is determined to enforce the ban this time, and there is no reason to be optimistic about a resurgence. The reporter listened for a long time, and the biggest impression he got was that these people felt lost about their future livelihoods.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The Wen Lanting traitor suspect case, which has attracted much attention, has had its public hearing postponed again and again due to the defendant's illness or refusal to appear in court. Although the court held the first trial on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, it only summoned witnesses, and the defendant himself was not interrogated due to illness. The defendant's family, relatives, and defense lawyers submitted a statement to the High Court, requesting bail, but all were rejected. It is now known that the High Court has scheduled the second trial for 10:00 AM on the 5th of this month. When the notice was delivered to the prison, the defendant did not sign it, and it seems that he still intends to refuse to appear in court. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the defendant himself will be willing to appear in court for trial at that time.</p>

<p>After that, the program unfolded, totaling 20 items, of which the泰山斗龜 Taishan Fight Turtle was the most fascinating, performed by Chen Ke and Qi Nanyang, and the sound effects were coordinated by Xu Liang in the microphone, which won a lot of applause. 海底銜月 Underwater Capture of the Moon, performed by Wu Yaoting and Shao Kangnian, were all real skills and quite commendable. In addition, such as 水中脫拷 Underwater Escape, 水上飯店 Water Restaurant, 遁水 Diving, etc., have a magical meaning. Tug-of-war, striptease competition, and滑稽 swimming competition were also extremely interesting. Fancy diving was performed by He Zhi and Liang Huibiao, former players from Peiping, and Chen Baohan and Qi Nanyang also dressed up to join the diving, for a total of twelve styles. The three-style swimming of the young children, with two participants, were both about ten years old, and the technology was extremely superb.</p>
<p>Mermaid Performance</p>
<p>Miss Yang Youqiong gave three individual performances, including 50-yard freestyle, butterfly stroke, and螺旋式 spiral style. Lu Shungen, the national freestyle 100-meter record holder, still dedicated his masterpiece to the audience, with a score of 64 seconds, which seemed to be slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Water sleep, by Zhang Minlong, with superior technology, floated on the water for up to 5 minutes, supplemented by Chen Shu's makeup interspersed, it was even more vivid. Finally, the nine members of the City Sports Swimming Team swam in a V-shape, followed by three small teams, symbolizing victory, with profound meaning. At 5:45, it ended, and the grand swimming performance ended.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Protecting Production, Assisting Government Orders: Joint Meeting of Cotton Product Industries Decides on Rectification Measures; Factories Without Production or Those That Have Suspended Production Are Not Allowed to Apply for Purchase; Product Prices Are Not Allowed to Be Raised; A Special Evaluation Committee Is Established <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange fluctuations and the sharp rise in the black market price of cotton yarn, various cotton product reproduction industry associations have felt difficulties in obtaining goods, and the cost of products has lost a correct calculation standard. Applying to the Textile Construction Corporation for the allocation of purchases seems to be extremely popular on the surface, but in reality, the sources are limited and the destinations are numerous, so the gains are very limited. Moreover, because the actual allocation is small and the purchase orders are more numerous, those who apply but do not get them are asking the respective associations for relief. Leaders of the dyeing, knitting, underwear, handkerchief, towel, blanket, and handmade cotton weaving industries have held joint meetings to discuss solutions. They all agreed that production should be protected and that fueling the black market price of yarn should be avoided. Steps should be rectified, and the difficulties of the Textile Construction Corporation should be understood in order to assist the government's orders. Recently, the various associations have convened meetings separately. According to authoritative sources, the joint measures have been decided as follows.</p>
<p>(1) When members apply to the Textile Construction Corporation for purchases, the Textile Construction Corporation often does not have enough time to check the size of the factory and the degree of its operation, and allocates a minimum amount uniformly. This is due to insufficient investigation data. The association has decided to re-investigate and compile statistics for the reference of the Textile Construction Corporation.</p>
<p>(2) Factories without production or those that have suspended production are not allowed to apply for purchase and sale.</p>
<p>(3) The association will dispatch staff to secretly investigate the market. If members are found to be selling purchase permits or opening goods to the Textile Construction Corporation on behalf of non-members, strict measures will be taken to crack down on them.</p>
<p>(4) The selling price of finished products shall not be raised except for maintaining legitimate profits. The association will set up an evaluation committee to control the matter.</p>
<p>(5) Because of the lack of capital in the handmade cotton weaving industry, the association acts as a unit to open goods to the Textile Construction Corporation. However, the number obtained is often not enough for distribution. Assistance should be given after the production equipment is investigated and clarified.</p>
<p>The above measures have been discussed several times. The various associations believe that they should be implemented uniformly. According to those familiar with the market situation, autumn sales are about to be launched, and the supply of cotton products should be increased. The various industries also plan to express their opinions to the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association in order to establish contact with the centralized sales organization of private yarn factories.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Three Banks and Two Bureaus Express Dissent Regarding the Measures for Repaying Pre-War Debts <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The financial and industrial circles of this city have expressed dissent regarding the recent court ruling on the measures for repaying pre-war and wartime debts. It has been learned that the authorities concerned have jointly sent a letter to the Four Joint Offices at the end of last week, requesting that it be forwarded to the government, demanding that the funds be returned according to the original amount of legal currency. The reasons are as follows: (1) It is considered inappropriate to repay the principal at a thousand times the original amount, as ruled by the court. The three banks and two bureaus do not provide long-term loans. The loans they handle are all short-term loans of three to six months, which were gradually recovered during the war. (2) The court ruled that additional interest should be paid on deposits, arguing that loans obtained during the war could yield exorbitant profits, and that creditors would suffer excessive losses if they were repaid at the original amount after this currency devaluation. However, the lending of the three banks and two bureaus has always been based on low-interest loans, and there are no exorbitant profits to be made. Not only is this the case for the banks and bureaus themselves, but the borrowers also cannot obtain exorbitant profits. This is because the borrowers of the banks and bureaus are not speculators or purely commercial organizations. The loans are provided to legitimate production enterprises, and the losses suffered by these production enterprises during the war are obvious to all.</p>

<p>Overcoating fabrics are in greatest demand during the autumn and winter seasons and also occupy one of the most important positions in the wool fabric market. In previous years, they would have been launched on the market successively around this time. This year, due to the arrival of imported goods, general users and buyers are deliberately delaying their purchases. Therefore, only a few transactions have been concluded on the market. This is the mentality of the buyers, so the market is naturally even slower. However, inconvenient transportation and unstable situation are also factors.</p>

<p>The market for dried lily flowers in Shanghai has been slightly stable recently. Because last year's production was scarce, the prices remain firm. According to reports from Xuzhou, the higher-quality goods are priced at 180,000 to 190,000 in Shanghai. The goods from Zhenjiang are in short supply, and there are no good goods at prices of 180,000 to 190,000. In the Wuxi market, good goods require around 200,000 to 210,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The outstanding amount of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes that were not exchanged was previously registered by the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for handling them and instructed the Central Bank to notify all registrants to submit the original notes for exchange into legal currency. It is learned that the exchange period was originally scheduled from September 1 to the end of the month, for a period of one month. However, because yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, the Central Bank has scheduled the exchange to begin today (2nd). Those who have registered to exchange counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes can exchange them with the documents issued by the bank. After the deadline, they will become waste paper, and the exchange period will not be extended.</p>

<p>[Our News] The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that at the beginning of the new exchange rate adjustment, in order to concretely implement this policy, the bureau has decided on three measures and strictly instructed its subordinates to handle them: (1) From the position of this tax bureau, it will fulfill its responsibility to maintain the stores and firms. In particular, it will pay attention to a kind and sincere attitude in its work in order to achieve the task of cultivating tax sources. It will also reiterate the previous order that absolutely no harassment is allowed. (2) It will closely monitor speculators taking the opportunity to raise prices and create disturbances, and deal with them effectively in accordance with the tax law. (3) There are numerous street vendors in this city, which has a great impact on the business of legitimate stores and firms. This bureau has long planned to crack down on them. Now that the city government has decided on measures, it will strictly order the offices in various districts to investigate and handle them effectively. The above three measures have been sent by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to various industry associations a few days ago for their information and to inform all members.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Exchange Rates and Prices <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The composition of prices is not solely dependent on exchange rates, but there is no doubt that exchange rates are one of the causes of prices. Therefore, with this exchange rate liberalization, there is a possibility that prices will fluctuate accordingly, but it will certainly not be equal to or exceed the increase in the exchange rate. If there is a phenomenon as described above, unless it is due to a temporary stimulus, it is done with ill intentions. The purpose of this exchange rate liberalization is to revitalize domestic industry and commerce and develop overseas markets, not to create opportunities for speculators and profiteers. Therefore, in addition to assuming the responsibility of cracking down on and punishing them, the government must also simultaneously implement other policies that are related to suppressing prices.</p>
<p>Prices are composed of costs (including raw materials, wages, depreciation), expenses, interest, taxes, and profits. As for the impact caused by supply and demand, it is only the elasticity of profits. Therefore, the increase in costs due to the exchange rate liberalization, if within the scope of profits, should not be raised in price in principle. However, the ultimate goal of an enterprise is naturally profit. In order to maintain industry and commerce, the government must protect its legitimate profits. With legitimate profits, it is not easy to create a black market. At the same time, in order to seek welfare for the public, it cannot but restrict its profits. With restrictions, it will not be cried all the way. Therefore, in the transitional period between war and peace, control and freedom, especially in the selfish China and the Shanghai that is obsessed with profiteering, the evaluation system seems to be the reason for promotion. Also, because of the evaluation, there is something to follow in cracking down on and punishing.</p>
<p>Goods can be simply divided into three categories: (1) imported foreign goods, (2) domestically manufactured goods, and (3) domestic agricultural products. Now, if we analyze the intrinsic situation of each type of goods, then we can understand the other related countermeasures that should be implemented in addition to the exchange rate policy, and the targets that should be under the evaluation system. At the beginning of peace, the profits obtained by importers were about three to four times as much. After that, as more goods arrived, the profits decreased slightly. Recently, private goods have been rampant, and theft has been prevalent, so that importers are no longer able to profit completely. Therefore, from the perspective of prices, if the government can eradicate smuggling and theft, there may not be drastic changes due to exchange rate changes. If we add an evaluation system, we may even be able to promote its decline.</p>
<p>Although the raw materials, machinery, and tools required by Chinese factories cannot be separated from foreign goods, they are not all foreign goods after all. Therefore, the result of the exchange rate changes will certainly not be equal to or exceed the increase in the exchange rate. Now, in addition to the government's exemption of export tariffs, it is also necessary to return export commodity taxes if necessary. Then it can directly develop foreign sales, indirectly encourage increased production, and reduce costs. If we add low-interest industrial loans or overdrafts and implement an evaluation system, we can ease the domestic stimulating prices and enable various industries to achieve a peaceful adjustment. The increase in the prices of products will certainly affect fertilizers and the cost of living of farmers. In the exchange rate change, it seems that the government's restriction on the price increase of agricultural products is lacking in fairness. However, the price fluctuation of agricultural products is relatively calm. If the government can eliminate harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and prevent disturbances, and at the same time hold low-interest agricultural loans that match the name and reality, implement evaluation, and investigate measures such as the cost of living index of farmers, or it can make the exchange rate stimulating fluctuations even calmer.</p>
<p>In short, in order to prevent price fluctuations caused by changes in the exchange rate, the government must pay attention to several countermeasures that are related to prices: (1) Eradicate smuggling and theft. (2) Crack down on unreasonable shipping costs. (3) Exempt export tariffs. (4) Return export commodity taxes. (5) Provide low-interest industrial loans or overdrafts. (6) Effectively provide low-interest agricultural tools. (7) Prevent disturbances and enforce the rule of law. (8) Prohibit harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. (9) Universally implement the evaluation system. But whether the so-called evaluation is a clean and competent evaluation of official-civil cooperation, otherwise it is more than enough to lead the price increase, and it is difficult to see fairness.

<h3 id="e111">The Pain of the Concerned <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Houjun</p>
<p>(I) A Comparison of Three Facts</p>
<p>I returned from Chongqing and, due to illness, resided in Suzhou and Shanghai. Recently, I returned to Zhenjiang, which I had been away from for nine years. What are the fruits of victory gained from the blood and sweat of millions of soldiers and civilians? This is the question I most urgently needed to answer upon my return. For example, in Suzhou, the masses held large-scale, frenzied processions to welcome the gods. A kind of fervent emotion and devout attitude made us suspect that this world was not yet in the atomic age. What was most shocking was the groups of young men and women, burning meat incense and striking hand-held gongs while laughing and chatting freely. This is probably regarded as a faithful expression of their devotion to the deities! From these welcoming processions, we can see that the collective recreational environment of the people and their new beliefs have not been established, which is indeed an important reason.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Zhenjiang, many refugees from northern Jiangsu came to weep and recount the situations of struggle and purges they had endured. The cruelty of these events seemed unprecedented even during the Japanese occupation, and I found it hard to believe. Inciting and rewarding tenant farmers to kill each other, especially smaller farmers, what was the purpose of this? Was it really just to fight over a bone? No, this is a conspiracy to get poor people to be cannon fodder, using them to exhaust the Kuomintang's bullets. It is a complete implementation of a policy of using famine and violence to drive the people to kill each other in order to seize power. I cannot help but ask, why is this kind of brutal force able to spread everywhere like a prairie fire? Where does the government's responsibility lie?</p>
<p>As for Shanghai, it is a paradise of extravagance and luxury for the rich (!). Taking glassware alone, it is draining away a large amount of the blood and sweat of our compatriots. This kind of phenomenon is, of course, because the rich have forgotten the disasters everywhere. What has been gained from eight years of bloody cleansing is merely the revival of a colonial slave mentality! At the same time, these kinds of consumer goods are invading everywhere, indirectly destroying the foundation of the vast countryside. What effective and concrete countermeasures has the government taken in terms of economic measures?</p>
<p>The welcoming processions in Suzhou demonstrate the feudal forces' counterattack against nation-building; the weeping complaints of the refugees in Zhenjiang demonstrate the obstruction of violent autocracy to nation-building; and the extravagance and unrestrained indulgence in Shanghai demonstrate the attack of the colonial slave mentality on nation-building. Although the three are expressed in different ways, the result is undoubtedly the same: suicide. Seeing the nation and people encounter this extreme crisis, can those who care remain indifferent? How should we struggle in the future? How can we be worthy of the countless soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the eight-year war of resistance?</p>
<p>(II) Three Things to Weep Bitterly For</p>
<p>Today's world, especially today's China, is in a state of extreme turmoil, with the danger of sinking and being destroyed. It seems that every problem has no proper solution, so everyone seems to feel extreme depression and worry, and is uneasy all day long.</p>
<p>For example, the realization of peace is originally the unanimous demand of the entire country, but today it has become a tool for ambitious people to seize territory, harm the country, and endanger the people. The ancients said: "If one values profit before righteousness, one will never be satisfied with what one seizes." In political consultations, everyone does not discuss how to truly implement the Three Principles of the People or effective ways to save the country and the people, but only haggles over the distribution of committee seats and the reorganization of a certain number of troops, seizing territory, fearing that it is not enough. There are even those who fan the flames and cheer, believing that this is a prerequisite for peace. However, they do not know that "valuing profit before righteousness" is only enough to fuel internal strife, prolong the suffering of the people, and make peace impossible for a long time. Using this kind of method to strive for peace, everyone should remember the story of "climbing a tree to catch fish." They only see the pitiful small plots of land of small and medium-sized farmers and do not hesitate to resort to cannibalism, forgetting the large tracts of virgin land on the border that have become a problem, and forgetting where the large number of machines in the three northeastern provinces have gone. Furthermore, no one has been heard advocating investigation. What kind of heart is this? This is the first thing to weep bitterly for.</p>
<p>Even more ridiculous, some people, under the anti-American movement, deliberately create alarming scenarios of a US-Soviet war, forgetting that their own house is already on fire. If this kind of argument really provokes a US-Soviet war, will the Chinese people be the first to go to war, declaring war on the United States first? At that time, please close your eyes and imagine what state the country would be in? If the nation and people really fall entirely into the arms of the Soviet Union and do not know how to be independent and self-reliant, who will be the favored ones? Currently, some people are openly selling out the personality of the nation and people, shouting the slogan of "international intervention." China, instead of being decided by the people, is decided by foreign countries. What about "democracy and independence?" All of this is thrown to the back of their minds. Originally, the purpose of using force is to promote "international intervention." What kind of heart is this? This is the second thing to weep bitterly for.</p>
<p>Burning meat incense to flatter the gods and using the means of liquidation and struggle to drive compatriots to kill each other in order to seize power are both "birds of a feather" in terms of rationality. Watching compatriots suffer from the oppression of famine without any compassion, living their luxurious lives in extravagance, this is the same as using famine to drive people to be cannon fodder, both being "cannibalistic" in human nature. Speaking of this, it reminds me of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The leaders of the Chinese-style Communist Party must know that playing with fire is not a joke, and the lives of the nation and people and tens of millions of ordinary people are important. Some people say: "Foreign systems and methods, although old, Chinese people like to use them as novelties to deceive their compatriots; but when they get into the hands of the Chinese, they all turn bad." What pitiful and heartbreaking words these are. This is the third thing to weep bitterly for.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of what Mr. Hu Shih said at a reception for the cultural circles in Shanghai, urging everyone to think more and study more: "If you think, you will gain; if you do not think, you will not gain. Since everyone's root cause of illness is in abandoning conscience, please use thought to find your conscience back." "There is no greater sadness than the death of the heart!" This is absolutely true. "Hanging meat incense," extravagance, and "struggle and liquidation," as well as those who consume white powder due to depression, are all seeking temporary pleasure, comfort, and excitement. The most pitiful and painful are those ignorant people who consume white powder, becoming more and more addicted, until they collapse! For now, rescuing people's hearts is the top priority!</p>
<p>(III) Returning to the Countryside</p>
<p>The ancients said: "In famine years, children are often violent." They also said: "Only when people are adequately clothed and fed do they know honor and shame." The Kuomintang has been in power for twenty years, and the legislation of the Three Principles of the People has achieved much. The resolutions of the Kuomintang's past national congresses, as well as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's past messages, and the book "China's Destiny," all extensively and repeatedly discussed things like the progress of cooperative enterprises, the resolution of the land problem, the promotion of agricultural industrialization, the determination of various social policies and agricultural and industrial policies, as well as so-called water conservancy, so-called finance, and so-called medical administration. If you study them carefully, there are indeed many good laws and good intentions. If they were implemented gradually, they would be enough to make the people prosperous and happy. Why is it that today there is still the fact of "leading beasts to eat people," happening in a raging fire? This is certainly due to the years of warlord separatism, imperialist aggression, and the mischief of the Chinese Communist Party, which has left the government no time for construction, but the government cannot deny its "incompetence." Waiting until the fire is on the house, without extinguishing it, yet still calmly allowing the division of the property inside the house; the flood has already broken through the embankment, without rescuing it, still arguing over the distribution of the land inside the embankment. In this situation, the government is duty-bound. Today, the only way for the government to free itself from blame is to quickly implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's messages, and fulfill the promises of past national congresses. There is no other way to go.</p>
<p>To quote another old saying: "The wise know everything, and know what is most urgent to do!" Now, in addition to military affairs, the work of putting out the fire should be done with politics. The current crisis no longer allows military setbacks or political toleration of evildoers! The current military setbacks have already disappointed the people; politics must not create sources of unrest. According to the current situation of the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu and the Communist Party's wandering in southern Jiangsu, their method of breaking up into smaller units can only be solved by "politics." Southern Jiangsu is again using military force to prevent riots! To be honest, if politics always relies on guns and does not revitalize itself, then internal strife will never have a day of peace! Strictly speaking, today we must not only implement "70% politics, 30% military affairs," but simply 90% politics and 10% military affairs. Because the governance and chaos of society depend on the support and opposition of the people's hearts. It must be known that the Chinese people are the most lovable. If the government can be clean and bright, the people themselves will rise up to curb the beginnings of chaos. If the government does not trust the people and the people have no self-defense force, then thirty to fifty armed unscrupulous people will be enough to coerce the vast number of farmers and start riots. Quickly re-cultivate the people's self-defense force! The people will choose their own path. It depends on whether the people used by the government truly love the people and can lead the people by learning from them.</p>
<p>As for the urgent tasks in terms of political measures, it is undoubtedly the rural problem. The Chinese revolution was originally meant to relieve the suffering of the majority of farmers. In terms of politics, the main task should be to revitalize agriculture. At the same time, in China, which is based on agriculture, the primary task in nation-building should also be to prosper the countryside. In response to the current situation, in order to save the crisis, the first priority should be to rescue the countryside.</p>
<p>Whether it is rescuing the countryside, building the countryside, or revitalizing the countryside, the first step is naturally to solve the land problem. Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed us that the policy of "land to the tiller" should be implemented without delay. After World War I, many countries in Eastern Europe, such as Poland and Romania, used government funds to buy land and distribute it to tenant farmers; they issued land bonds and recovered the land of landlords that exceeded their ability to cultivate, and then redistributed it. This was what our Founding Father instructed long ago, and there are also good regulations. Today, there are three land problems in China: too much wasteland, weak productivity, and distribution problems. Now these three items should be resolved at the same time by taking the opportunity, and only by taking overall consideration can both ideals and facts be properly resolved. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Industrial Plan, as well as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," are really great plans. The government should no longer delay matters by paying attention to some insignificant details and show some courage to do things practically. Great plans must be done by taking advantage of the situation and must not be achieved by delaying and perfunctory measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cooperative organizations are an effective way to "make the best use of people's talents," "make the best use of the land," "make the best use of things," and "make goods flow smoothly." Consumer cooperation takes the interests of consumers as a prerequisite, and production and marketing cooperation takes the interests of producers as a prerequisite, and is also a bridge to agricultural industrialization. Only by transforming small farmers into large farmers and combining the strength of many people into one can agricultural industrialization be completed. In this way, the function of cooperative organizations can be fully realized.</p>
<p>However, the current situation of cooperative organizations has not given full play to their functions, and has even become a tool for exploiting farmers and increasing the oppression of farmers. This should be immediately reviewed, improved, and expanded. Whether the current agricultural loans are truly benefiting farmers should also be reviewed. In the future, the targets of loans and the implementation of land tax collection should all be based on cooperative organizations as the target and as the tool, and all agricultural construction work should be coordinated with the promotion of cooperative organizations. In this way, cooperative organizations can develop universally and complete their functions.</p>
<p>Other constructions, improvements and guides such as water conservancy, transportation, and agriculture, as well as the management and cultivation of agricultural and sideline industries, all need to be reviewed, improved, and implemented practically one by one, and we must not relax the high-level coordination and appropriate use of various materials from international relief and assistance.</p>
<p>The four words "ignorance," "poverty," "selfishness," and "weakness" are the common symptoms of the Chinese countryside, so it is not enough to just solve the problems of livelihood and wealth, and we should also step up the work of "education." Past education was isolated, and rural mass education was even more isolated. The entire Chinese education system needs to be reformed practically in accordance with national conditions as soon as possible. Mass education should be closely coordinated with "medical administration" and various agricultural construction efforts and promoted simultaneously. Is it enough to set up some mass education centers to do some decoration to be considered doing everything possible? Rural mass education should focus on adult remedial education, and it must be closely coordinated with various rural revitalization efforts. Its educational content must be coordinated with the needs of various rural revitalization efforts. Like Denmark, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they divide adult and children's departments in national schools, and Japan has special remedial schools in national schools. In China, where farmers account for 80% of the population, is the proportion of education funds used in rural-related areas reasonable compared to the burden on farmers? This is a question that deserves our deep reflection and introspection.</p>
<p>However, the political system should also be re-examined. Taking various political measures related to rural construction as an example, has the lack of coordination in the past reduced much efficiency? Since the main political measures in the future are aimed at the countryside, various works related to rural construction should first be carried out in a unified manner. Only in this way can the expected results be achieved. This is what I solemnly propose as an aside.</p>
<p>(IV Reform of Political Conduct)</p>
<p>The fundamental problem in current politics is the problem of political conduct, and the problem of political conduct lies in being able to employ people wisely, using only the virtuous and the capable. The failure of current political conduct lies in the failure to distinguish between the wise and the foolish, the virtuous and the unworthy. Therefore, those who are speculative, opportunistic, flattering, and smiling all get the chance to advance through connections, while just and virtuous people are sometimes rejected. May I ask, how can this kind of personnel arrangement meet the needs of the work? How can this kind of work assessment achieve the practical effect of governance? Going a step further, the big disease in Chinese politics is "isolation." Those who bear great responsibility must first seriously examine their own past trusted people. Therefore, to select the virtuous and appoint the capable, please start with your own subordinates, and please start with those who bear the negative responsibility!</p>
<p>Mencius said: "A ruler who will accomplish great things must have ministers who are not summoned." The so-called ministers who are not summoned are precisely the virtuous and capable. The so-called "Nine Rank System" in the Wei, Jin, Sui, and Tang dynasties can still be used for reference today. Striving for the virtuous and capable is really a prerequisite for turning danger into safety and restoring order. Based on this, responsible officials must thoroughly change their style and emulate the spirit of the Duke of Zhou, who spat out food in his mouth and held his hair three times while bathing. The rise and fall of the nation and people also depend on this. A revolutionary party must always pay attention to refining talent and promoting talent. Refining talent is nothing more than six words: "democracy," "unity," and "unification." Seek democracy with an open mind, use democracy to strive for unity, and use unity to strive for unification. The so-called democracy must be closely coordinated with workers, farmers, division of labor, work assessment, and work competition, so that everyone has the opportunity to offer opinions and contribute abilities. If work assessment is democratized, then right and wrong will be clear; if work competition is democratized, then rewards and punishments will be fair; if talents are democratized, then they will naturally unite and generate strength. The power of unity is built on democracy. What cannot be unified? Only a high degree of democracy can achieve truly centralized unification, and only then can it innovate, eliminate the old, and continuously strengthen itself. This is the most reasonable principle of party organization and political system!</p>
<p>(V) Conclusion</p>
<p>Mr. Yen Hui-ching said at a welcoming banquet for Mr. Hu Shih a month ago that the problem of China is a matter of time. I feel that the problem of China has reached a critical juncture of survival and is not to be delayed or waited for. Today's problem is not a problem of right and wrong, but a problem of "affirming what is right" and "denying what is wrong." Since we know that robbing chickens is wrong, why wait? The ruling Kuomintang and the virtuous people of the whole country should take the hunger and drowning of others as their own, and after self-reflection and self-blame, work together and strive to eliminate selfish thoughts of the small self or faction, and move forward in unity. Under this kind of united struggle, all the corrupt and evil forces of "leading people to feed people" will naturally tend to disappear. However, when moving forward in unity, we must eliminate the "weeds among the seedlings," the "purple among the vermilion," and all the ambiguous gray elements. This kind of hypocritical, gray element has misled the Kuomintang and the nation and people in the past, and is most likely to speak for the enemy and discourage patriots. We must eliminate these fake revolutionary elements in order to establish a grand plan for democracy, strengthen revolutionary unity, unify the power of construction, and accomplish the task of revolutionary nation-building. Under our strong and just struggle, as Mr. Yen said, the solution to the problem is just a matter of time.</p>

<p>A Proposal for Constructing an Overpass</p>
<p>In the most prosperous areas of transportation, such as north-south and east-west interwoven routes, where all kinds of vehicles converge to an extreme degree, in order to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, the police must temporarily cut off one route to allow vehicles on the other route to pass. Such repeated cutoffs cause vehicles to stop and go, with the time spent stopping being more than twice the time spent driving. Pedestrians lose their autonomy when crossing the road and sometimes rush across the road, which is extremely dangerous and can even cause injury or death. In order to avoid danger and congestion, and to allow vehicles and pedestrians to pass safely and smoothly in an orderly manner, the best solution is to construct an overpass. For example, in the section of Zhongzheng Road and Xier Road, where various vehicles go south and north and pedestrians connect, if an overpass is first constructed in this section, vehicles and pedestrians going south and north can pass over the bridge. The bridge surface can be paved with sidewalks on both sides, and the direction of pedestrians coming and going on both sides can be strictly regulated, as well as whether they should walk on the bridge or under the bridge surface. In this way, they can walk in order without being threatened by vehicles. The underside of the bridge can be equipped with fluorescent lights, with the right level of brightness. The pedestrian path under the bridge should be paved in the same way as the roadside. Then the movement of pedestrians and vehicles can be orderly, safe, and spectacular. However, whether the overpass requires additional precision design for small turns and interwoven roads with trams must wait for the research of experts.</p>

<p>Truth About the Suspension of Yucai Night School</p>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the suspension of the night school at our school, we would like to provide the following explanation: In March of this year, our school, in accordance with the instructions of the Education Bureau, established a night school for the masses in order to cooperate with the work program of eliminating illiteracy and promoting education. Teachers and staff of our school, together with high school juniors and seniors, volunteered to teach. At the beginning, we originally planned to enroll illiterates in accordance with the bureau's order. However, fearing that it would be difficult to enroll students at the beginning and affect the opening of classes, we admitted those who had received three or four years of education, resulting in uneven student levels. Therefore, we divided them into three levels: high, medium, and low. The high level is equivalent to the fifth and sixth grades, the medium level is equivalent to the third and fourth grades, and the low level is equivalent to the first and second grades.</p>
<p>When the semester ended in July of this year, we originally planned to close the high level, graduate them, and enroll new students. However, the high-level students were eager to learn and repeatedly requested to continue their studies. The teachers and students who volunteered to teach, considering their suffering from dropping out of school and their eagerness to learn, used their summer vacation to hold a summer class for remedial instruction. Moreover, the subjects offered were not limited to those stipulated by the Education Bureau. Now that the end of the summer class is approaching, students in the business level have requested to continue running a junior high school. However, because the original intention of the Education Bureau in ordering the opening of mass schools is limited to eliminating illiteracy, and the formal opening of junior high school classes must first obtain the consent of the Education Bureau and go through registration procedures before it can be handled, we could not rashly agree. However, in order to take into account the students' desire to learn, we introduced the students to the Zhongzheng Night Middle School, which was established by the Youth Corps in the factory school. Therefore, if these students are interested in learning, they can enroll in that school. This is the actual situation. It seems that there are some discrepancies with the letter forwarded by your newspaper. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth, we have briefly stated the situation for reference. (Respectfully submitted by Zhi Fan, Principal of Municipal Yucai Middle School).</p>

<h3 id="e113">Reader Proposes Installment Payments of Tuition Fees and Discounts Based on the Original Standard <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Authorities Should Pay Close Attention to Excessive Burden on Parents</p>
<p>Reader Shao Bingjin wrote to our newspaper, saying: "To the Editor, although the issue of tuition fees this semester has been repeatedly raised by parents, it has received little attention. The media and the Education Bureau sympathize with the school's arrangements, which is of course partly justified. However, according to what I (an employee of a Qianzhuang) know, a certain school related to the Qianzhuang industry recently held a meeting to discuss and calculate that tuition fees of more than 10,000 yuan can be collected, and requested each Qianzhuang to deposit 200 to 300 yuan, with interest at a rate of one jiao per month. It is estimated that more than 1,000 yuan of interest can be collected each month, which is enough to cover expenses. All the tuition fees will be the school's profit. By this example, the school can be said to have entered a golden age. Now, reading the newspaper, I learned that the mayor convened a meeting of private school principals at 2:00 p.m. on September 2 to discuss the issue of tuition fees. My opinion is that it is best to pay in installments according to the original standard, and those who are willing to pay in one lump sum should be given a discount. The same should apply to meal fees. Now, in private schools, except for universities, the tuition fees of primary and secondary schools are mostly paid painfully in order to avoid my brother from dropping out of school. The discount part should be ordered by the Yellow Decree to be returned to the school based on the original receipt. Is this appropriate? Please ask readers to review it fairly for the mayor to adopt. Knowing that the Agricultural Newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and this matter concerns education, I trust that it will be published in advance. Please be safe."</p>

<h3 id="e114">Current Status of Automobile Production in the United States <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— By Ying Dai</p>
<p>The lack of accessories and some raw materials has caused difficulties for American automobile factories. General industrialists are even more convinced that this situation cannot improve in a short period of time. The annual output of automobiles will also be much lower than expected. If the current situation does not change, then the assembly rooms of major automobile factories will inevitably find it difficult to produce two million passenger cars. This is more than half less than the scheduled plan for 1946. Looking back at the end of the European War, the result of the United States' efforts to restore normal automobile production in ten months was the manufacture of 300,000 new cars.</p>
<p>General Motors experienced a labor strike for nineteen weeks during these ten months and only resumed work at the end of May. Naturally, automobile production was severely affected. Ford Motor Company has been making every effort to mass produce since July of last year, but due to the shortage of steel, it was once forced to shut down for a week. All assembly rooms were shut down, and there was no production. When production was halted at the end of May, the average daily production was 3,500 cars, while normally it could produce 5,000 cars. Chrysler, together with all its branches, produces 2,500 cars per day, but due to the lack of raw materials, it will definitely not increase in the short term. The large strike also caused the Airflow assembly room, which produces the most cars for Chrysler, to shut down for many days, and the impact was not small. Packard was shut down for nine weeks due to lack of parts. Although it tried its best to resume work later, production could not be increased in the short term, especially due to the shortage of steel. Although Studebaker has a plan to manufacture the 1947 model new car, the assembly room was once shut down.</p>
<p>The serious problem currently facing the American automobile manufacturing industry is the insufficient supply of steel plates for making car bodies and mudguards, as well as various other steel castings. Several automobile factories stated that their buffer inventory is running low, while other automobile factories are producing cars without buffers at all. Regarding the raw materials, parts, and accessories for manufacturing cars, no automobile factory has what can be considered an average inventory. Inconvenient transportation has also affected the production of various automobile factories. During the four-and-a-half-month strike period, General Motors had a large amount of raw materials and accessories in stock, so their car production work should not be affected for the time being in the coming months. Various automobile factories have paid special attention to the strike issue of coal miners because this could reduce steel production and indirectly affect automobile production.</p>
<h3 id="e115">From Water Power to Atomic Energy <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Lin Han</p>
<p>Three hundred years ago, on May 23, 1646, America began its first patent grant.</p>
<p>Jiseph Jenkes, a restless young man, left his homeland—England—in 1642 and came to Lynn, Massachusetts, where he helped establish the flourishing iron industry of the British colonies in America.</p>
<p>Jenkes discovered abundant and untapped natural treasures in the land he moved to. His greatest need seemed to be for some machines to help humans work, so he devoted himself to this issue; until March 6, 1646, he applied for a patent for a water-powered sawmill, which he praised as a "water-powered grinding machine."</p>
<p>The Massachusetts government granted Jwnkes a patent for fourteen years. This was the first time the government had rewarded an inventor based on the National Patent Conference. Subsequently, other colonies followed Massachusetts and implemented patent laws to encourage new inventions.</p>
<p>George Washington and Thomas Jefferson firmly believed in the method of rewarding the work of authors or inventors with patents. When the United States Constitution was drafted, everyone insisted that it should include provisions empowering Congress to establish a patent system.</p>
<p>In 1790, the first United States Patent Law was enacted; the first patent granted by the United States government under this law was for the method of manufacturing caustic potash.</p>
<p>For forty-six years, almost all patent applications were approved, and little attention was paid to the inventions and their origins. Later, in 1836, all records of inventions and patents were destroyed by fire, marking the beginning of the reform of the patent system.</p>
<p>Congress established the Patent Office as an independent agency, and the patent numbers started from scratch again. Patent No. 1 was granted to a congressman named John Ruggles, who had made discoveries on the already rudimentary steam train.</p>
<p>Since then, nearly three million patent cases have been granted. In 1946, exactly three hundred years after Jenkes obtained the first patent in Massachusetts, the United States government approved the patent for atomic energy. In three centuries, mankind has jumped from the age of water power to the age of atomic energy. Who knows how far mankind will progress in the next three hundred years!</p>
<p>The protection of patent law is certainly a factor in the expansion of American industry. Patents are extremely important for individual inventors and smaller manufacturers. Patent protection often becomes the only way for them to compete with large industries in the business arena.</p>
<p>The United States has a strong patent protection system, but the concept itself is not new. Because before humans discover good ways of doing things, everyone has tried to obtain the benefits of their invented ideas. It is said that the world's first patent was granted to a cook in ancient Greece; he invented a new and delicious food, and the local emperor gave him the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell it.</p>
<p>On the plaque in the Washington Patent Office entrance, is engraved a famous saying by Abraham Lincoln, an inventor who has obtained several United States patents:</p>
<p>"The patent system adds the fuel of interest to the fire of genius."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Worthy of Attention: Cultural Primary Schools and Industry <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— By Fei Wen</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, the Chung Hwa Book Company had a scientific equipment factory. It recruited a group of apprentices aged thirteen or fourteen and taught them crafts such as manufacturing model specimens of scientific instruments, which were close to works of sculptural art. This group of apprentices was strictly managed, and they themselves were willing to work tirelessly. After work, they formed a research association, always had their fists ready for practice, and were always studying and reading related patterns and books. Among them, the colleagues considered the outstanding ones to be Zhou Shichen, Ding Peiqiang, Zhu Jinyu, Zhao Libo, Sun Boying, and Zhong Jiaqin, six people in total.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the war broke out, and the Chung Hwa factory was forced to close down, so they lost their jobs—not only lost their jobs, but also lost their research base. For the sake of bread, they had to go their separate ways to find jobs and change careers, but on the one hand, they still gathered together in secret, studying their beloved crafts with like-mindedness. It was also because of their efforts as human beings that although they changed careers, they all rose up in their non-industry businesses. During the eight years of the war, most of them climbed to the positions of directors or principals of various companies or schools in the business community. In terms of fame and profit, they were no longer what they used to be. Until the victory, from an individual perspective, they had no reason and wanted to "return to their old jobs."</p>
<p>But one thought strengthened their journey. They believed that only if everyone dedicated themselves to the career in which they were "specialized" to seek development, and never took speculation and profiteering as the purpose of life, would it be true patriotism. What's more, the career they wanted to engage in was very obvious, and it was greatly beneficial to the motherland's education!</p>
<p>After deciding, they began to act, not hesitating to turn their years of savings into company shares, not hesitating to take off their long gowns and run back into the factory again. The concepts of fame and profit as directors and principals seemed very indifferent to them. Just like that, a newly established small factory was discovered by people in a damp street on Shaanxi North Road. Its capital was only 40 million, and there were only more than 30 employees, but their love for this cause and their spirit were infinite. The name was "New Chung Hwa Scientific Equipment Manufacturing Factory."</p>
<p>The factory building occupies three floors. According to Manager Zhou, it is enough for current use. In addition to the office, reception room, and material room downstairs, the rest is the rough workshop. The entire second floor is the fine workshop, and the third floor is the staff dormitory, etc. This type of work is extremely fragmented and complicated. The reporter, being a "layman," also found it difficult to describe it in detail. From the vertical aspect of the work, it can be roughly divided into sawing, shaping, coloring, and taxidermy, etc. From the horizontal aspect, there are stone-made, wax-made, paper-made, and collecting and planting native animals, plants, and minerals, and giving them preservative treatment, etc.</p>
<p>As for the products, in addition to various animal, plant, and mineral specimens, there are complete human anatomy, detailed skeletal charts, internal organ classifications, and pathological phenomena such as smallpox, syphilis, alcohol poisoning, etc. If a certain industrial production process uses physical objects to illustrate, as well as scientific instruments used in science, they are all within the scope of work.</p>
<p>Due to the convenience of company paperwork and administration, they also have the distribution of managerial, deputy managerial, and director positions, but there are two points that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>First, they all participate in actual work. Deputy Manager Gong Peiqiang is said to be an authority on wax products, so he spends most of his day in the wax workshop. His shaved head, paired with sleeveless hands, is carving out a child's face with a knife, stroke by stroke. Seeing his great interest and earnestness in his work, it seems that he has long forgotten that a month ago, he was still the accounting director of the Tai Le Dance Troupe!</p>
<p>Second, their life in the factory is like a living group. The reporter saw a factory regulation hung in the reception room, and what was strange was that there was a sentence inside saying, "During work, we are comrades, and after work, we are brothers." It can be seen how much they understand and care for each other. In terms of management, from various equipment, you can see some complete aspects, with daily administrative diaries, factory affairs diaries, and various reports, classified records, etc. This small industry for culture is worth recommending by the reporter, and it is even more hoped that the education community will give it the greatest assistance. All levels of schools and the medical community across the country have suffered losses during the war, and scientific instruments, specimen models, and other stationery that were previously stored have often been lost or damaged. Therefore, adding new ones and repairing them is an urgent need. The teaching method of natural science, as recorded in books, is only a system of sequence. Hearing is not as good as seeing. Having all kinds of physical models ready to give students a deep impression is actually more important than books. According to Manager Zhou of the factory, there are still less than a dozen manufacturers across the country engaged in this industry, which is enough to prove the backwardness of science in our country. Therefore, the new creation of the factory, from the internal words out of the starting point, from the external words out of the need, are worthy of attention. We give the highest sympathy and provide possible assistance, which should be everyone's duty.</p>

<p>— By Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>However, employing female workers or child laborers also has the following disadvantages:</p>
<p>A. Working ability is not as good as male workers. As a result of past factory experiments, the work efficiency of female workers is not as good as that of male workers. This may have a considerable relationship with the fact that female workers do not have to bear household expenses. Because they do not need to bear household expenses, their sense of responsibility is lower. After the sense of responsibility is lower, work efficiency is easily reduced. However, the fact that female workers are physically weaker and cannot cope with heavy work is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>B. Ladies are prone to absenteeism: The second disadvantage of female workers is absenteeism. For example, during the production period and menstruation, both cause absenteeism. According to the statistics of several manufacturers, the number of absences of female workers is 50% to 100% higher than that of male workers.</p>
<p>C. Female workers need a better environment: Because the bodies of female workers are generally not as strong as those of male workers, the factory environment, such as temperature, air, and sunlight, needs to be better. At the same time, if a large number of female workers are employed, other facilities such as nurseries and breastfeeding rooms are also needed so that female workers can bring their children to the factory. In this way, they can work with peace of mind. This type of equipment requires an expenditure from the factory, but the amount saved in wages may still be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Places like textile factories and yarn factories employ the most female workers, and female workers are more suitable for packaging work.</p>
<p>Use male workers or female workers</p>
<p>Regarding this question, it cannot be generalized and depends entirely on the manufacturing situation. The following principles should be considered:</p>
<p>A. Are male workers or female workers more able to cope with the work that needs to be done?</p>
<p>B. What are the general habits?</p>
<p>C. In fact, is it easier to recruit male workers or female workers?</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, it is very relevant to work efficiency. For example, if a certain type of work is usually done by female workers, then naturally, it is appropriate to employ female workers, because skilled workers can be obtained in this way, and the training work can be saved. Unskilled workers, on the one hand, work slowly, on the other hand, inevitably work substandardly, and on the third hand, easily consume raw materials. These three points are a kind of loss for manufacturers.</p>
<p>Time required other than actual manufacturing</p>
<p>In general manufacturing plants, the time actually spent on the machine often only accounts for one-half or two-thirds of the total manufacturing time (the situation is different). For example, in a printing plant, the time required to print a piece of printed matter on the printing press does not occupy the total time required. For example, cutting the paper into small pieces, washing off the red ink before printing the yellow color, etc., all take a considerable amount of time. If the time on the machine is already extremely economical, and the time spent in other aspects is wasted, then the overall economy cannot be obtained, the speed will decrease, production will decrease, and the cost will increase, and the profit will therefore decrease.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Respectfully Addressed to Writers and Readers <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>This publication is a comprehensive literary and artistic supplement. Since the resumption of this newspaper, it has successively received enthusiastic contributions from writers in the literary and artistic circles, providing assistance in many ways; and has also been warmly loved and guided by readers across the country; the editors are grateful and are willing to take advantage of today's Journalist's Day to offer a few suggestions.</p>
<p>Originally, the creation of language and writing, as well as various forms of artistic expression, are nothing more than expressions of human life's will and emotions. The literature and art of any era reflects the influence of the era, and the style expressed in form and the consciousness expressed in content are the achievements of the writer's perception and effort in response to the era, and often enough to shift the direction of the era; therefore, a great era will inevitably produce great works, and great works can further promote a great era. Even in the history of journalism, there is no shortage of famous supplements that have influenced social dynamics. — Today, we are willing to work together with writers and readers across the country based on this understanding, hoping to initially make this publication:</p>
<p>1.  A public garden for writers across the country to publish their works,</p>
<p>2.  A supplement to the spiritual food of the readers of this newspaper.</p>
<p>In order to enrich the content and improve the standards, we especially welcome short literary and artistic essays, poems, novels, fables, essays, and reports of news from literary circles at home and abroad, as well as reviews of literary publications and art exhibitions. The content should be profound and meaningful, and the form may be popular and clear; serious commentary is certainly needed, and humorous and witty comments are also welcome, and those that are time-sensitive are especially welcome. As for the number of words, due to space limitations, it is best to be around a thousand words, which is suitable.</p>
<p>Here, we also hope that readers who love this publication will provide guidance and suggestions at any time and place, just like going to a restaurant or entering a battlefield, ordering food and reviewing plays. We feel that this is the right of readers. And we are willing to declare that we will do our best to follow it within the possible scope.</p>
<p>As for the position of the editor, it is like a waiter in a restaurant or a prompter backstage. As for whether today's nagging has any reference value, it still depends on the acceptance and advice of writers and readers. (Editor) (September 1)</p>
<h3 id="e119">Summer Night <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Su Dan</p>
<p>The banana trees are green again, it's the season when cicadas are calling!</p>
<p>Do you love the summer breeze? So slowly, so slowly, it's like dragging a piece of light silk, especially at night, when you are enjoying the cool air at night, do you love the stars and the moon? Do you want to understand a little bit of life's revelation? Although the frogs are shouting too noisily. But don't pay attention to this annoying night music, just calm down and lie on a deck chair or lean against the window, silently gazing at the distant stars, that bit of infinite blue light is a long poem that can't be finished, try to use your imaginative key, use your clever wisdom to discover, you will get precious life's revelations, it will make you understand the noble emotions of human beings, the love and hate of the world, the barriers, distance, and envy between people...</p>
<p>When I was young, someone once told me: "A star shows a person's life. When your life ends, a shooting star will fall in the blue sky." Don't think this is an absurd statement. This mysterious symbolic meaning, think about it carefully, and you will feel the preciousness of life. People live among people, just like there is a star in the stars that is your life. Don't be attached to the flowers of spring and the moon of autumn. Only the stars of the summer night will reveal to you a more holy feeling...</p>
<p>Although the color of the summer night is faint, don't sigh the dim starlight. Life is the same. People live for themselves, but don't forget that you live among people. Although the brilliance of a star is weak, and life is not very long, if you can leave a little memory in people, and leave a little thought in other people's hearts... In this way, the course of your life will not be a blank piece of paper. Don't stop on the road of life, don't be lazy, and try to embellish the short years of life with the enthusiasm of life. A person should try to show their own brilliance, just like the stars in the summer night. Even if it is a little blue light, they should leave this bit of light in the world. In this way, you will not have wasted your life in vain.</p>
<p>When you are enjoying the cool air at night, you should appreciate a little more of the stars of the summer night, and you will understand the preciousness of life, and you will understand the revelation of life. For this profound revelation of the summer night, the noble emotions will be purified more sacredly!</p>

<h3 id="e121">Morning Glow <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>Living in the city, watching the morning glow is just a monotonous or superfluous thing. If you are a person who lives a night life, or is nestled in a deep and solemn mansion, and has not opened your sleepy eyes until the sun is high in the sky, then you don't know what the morning glow is.</p>
<p>Living in the suburbs or in the countryside, getting up at dawn, standing on that wide expanse of grassland connected to the sky, or from those continuous purple mountains lying under the clouds, you can see the morning glow and know that the earth, which was a deathly gray color at night, has been awakened by the abundant light of life, and see the scene of "the plan for the day lies in the morning."</p>
<p>I am used to living in the countryside, and now I also live in a remote suburb far from the city. The grassland in front of the window is like an endless green carpet under my feet. A small forest in the distance leads my eyes to the horizon; every dawn, I open the east-facing window and quietly watch the morning glow in the distant sky.</p>
<p>At first, silvery-white light with a thin mist shines in, and slowly the morning glow is like a magical symphony, gradually entering the joyous, jumping, and sonorous scales from a soft harmony. The red and golden light rings spread out and expand. The colors of the spring of life and the music of the spring of life are playing together, and mankind enjoys the golden sunlight!</p>
<p>Pieces of clouds, some with distinct lines and graceful shapes, and others as fine as fish scales, spread out towards the silent sky. Looking at it, you can find what is beautiful and what is noble in the world. Even if your desolate life is in the twilight years of the fleeting years and has given rise to the idea of being tired of life, the flowing years of life are like passing water, however, quietly watching a piece of morning glow, it adds hope for rebirth and beauty to you.</p>
<p>Those humble villagers who live entirely on the soil of the land, in front of them, only cast a dark shadow of their own, just as they drag the shadow of disaster throughout their lives. However, the morning glow is dyed on their faces and sprinkled on their chests, so that they still work hard without worry. This is the strength that the morning glow gives them. They know how to cherish the hard work of life. When an old farmer carries a hoe and slowly walks across the grass path covered with golden morning glow, silently walking towards the distance, a distant view of a brilliant morning glow shines in front of him, and everything is so radiant. Do you say this is the beginning of life, or the end of life?</p>
<p>I love this morning glow that opens the door of light. Every clear morning, I stand by the window, although my mind is still lingering with the shadow of yesterday's worries, but I push open the window and still recite Tagore's lines: "Our desires lend rainbow-like colors to the life of only gray and white clouds!"</p>
<p>Morning glow full of hope, may you awaken the sleeping people!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Mountain City Night View <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Haoran</p>
<p>If it can be said that this dull mountain city of Chongqing has something captivating, it must be its hazy, dreamlike night view. Indeed, if you closely follow the overcrowded bus belching black smoke in pursuit of prosperity, if you enter the noisy, chaotic teahouses of all kinds of people to enjoy leisure, if you go to the crowded, vulgar parks to appreciate scenery, then the door of disappointment will open for you, and troubling thoughts will fill your mind, because you are fundamentally on an impossible path. You are lost in the smoke and clouds of fantasy. You must understand that the greatness of Chongqing does not lie in its tall buildings and streets, not in its steep slopes and dangerous cliffs, not in its crowds and noise, but in its dignified and unyielding spirit, which is the only guarantee of the nation's eternal life. Similarly, if you want to appreciate the magnificent and majestic outline of this mountain city, you must stand outside the city and observe it from afar with the eyes of an artist.</p>
<p>Looking at the night view of Chongqing from Haitangxi on the south bank of the Yangtze River, it is truly a beautiful picture, stored in my impression album, and I have not forgotten it to this day. In the vastness of the night, the dense rows of electric lights emit a mixed yellow halo, permeating the sky. The halo is most dazzling above the city, then rises layer by layer, weakening line by line, until it merges with the floating clouds, and one can no longer distinguish where the clouds are and where the light and shadows are! This suddenly rising mountain city, in the vast night light, seems like a crown described in Western mythology, its imposing grandeur truly unparalleled! Yes, it is a crown of the people's century, it is worn on the head of every patriotic Chinese son! It stands tall in the dark days of the past, and no amount of storms and fiery bombs can shake it. It is truly the pride of China; it further projects its light to every corner of the country, giving people groping in the darkness a guide to move forward; giving people sighing in disappointment solace for their hearts!</p>
<p>Standing alone and quietly on the grassy slope, yet the city noise across the river still reaches your ears intermittently, as if telling you that the people of the mountain city are still working day and night to manage their busy lives. This human sound is precisely the melody of life, whether you are happy or annoyed, as long as it is a densely populated place, it will be playing in bursts. How can the mountain city be an exception? However, at this time, the sparse and dense sounds, riding on the gentle night breeze, drift slowly, and there is indeed a pleasant rhythm! When the night, this night of the mountain city full of sights and sounds, unfolds naked before your eyes, how can you not linger again and again, forgetting to return?</p>
<p>Only in the hazy night, only under the drowsy lamplight, is the scenery of Chongqing charming. The bright stars in the sky seem to be blinking their bright eyes in admiration of its majestic appearance, and the gurgling water in the Yangtze River seems to be singing a hymn of blessing for its spectacular sight. Oh, those who are immersed in the beautiful realm of imagination while watching the night view from afar, how can they bear to move and leave abruptly? Truly, if it were not for the mournful long cry of the Yangtze River night ferry, how would one know that the hands of the clock had already passed midnight?</p>
<h3 id="e123">An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 20</p>
<p>Based on my observation, at this time, neither side's army has a unified front-line positional warfare. They are probably divided into several areas facing each other, with occasional skirmishes.</p>
<p>"Alright, old man," he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, "We can get on the main road. I heard our people talking, and there are cars, like rickshaws."</p>
<p>I could also vaguely see the outline of a road about 100 meters away. After walking quickly for a few minutes, I saw a row on the road; judging by the movement, it seemed to be a row of rickshaws, a very long line, about ten or twenty.</p>
<p>Discovering the road and seeing this long row made me feel half as light. I vaguely heard the rickshaw pullers talking boldly about the war, running and talking; it seemed there were also the groans of patients mixed in.</p>
<p>When we cut diagonally across and were about to step onto the road, we suddenly heard the sound of a heavy truck traveling at high speed, coming from behind. In just a minute or two, the headlights were like water columns, shining on the rickshaw row in front.</p>
<p>"Ah... er...!" It was a military truck, with what seemed like a dozen Japanese soldiers on it, shouting and yelling, mixed with two gunshots.</p>
<p>We lay flat on the edge of the field beside the road. The rickshaw row ten or so meters away was already in disarray. Some in the front and back had stopped, some increased speed, some stopped and started. The truck screeched to a halt not far from where we were lying. Fully armed "Imperial Army" soldiers jumped out one by one.</p>
<p>Charge!... "Split into two lines to encircle!" Someone gave the order; the small spotlight on top of the truck had already been turned on, and the chaotic rickshaw row was in a terrible mess under the strong light of the spotlight, because some were still trying to pull their rickshaws and escape into the fields beside the road.</p>
<p>"The rickshaws are full of our wounded soldiers!" Little Tiger said twice, afraid I hadn't heard him clearly.</p>
<p>The "Imperial Army's" brave performance officially began; some used bayonets, some were slightly more humane, only using their guns to thrust and stab. The rickshaw pullers screamed and fled, and the wounded soldiers in the rickshaws either rolled out themselves, or were dragged out, thrown to the ground, stabbed with a knife, or finished off with a shot.</p>
<p>Only one thing I saw very clearly: none of these wounded soldiers and rickshaw pullers had any weapons, not even a bayonet.</p>
<p>"Alas...!" I sighed in hatred. For me, this was an insulting challenge, but what should I do? Even with the headquarters badge and identity, it would be difficult to reverse this tragedy. If I were to fight these crazed Bushido warriors, my personal life would be nothing, but I have a more important mission!</p>
<p>"Can I borrow your pistol for a bit, old man?" Little Tiger had already reached out and grabbed the grip of my pistol.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chinese journalists can be said to have been worthy of the nation.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, after the city fell, they stood bravely at their original posts and fearlessly fulfilled their journalistic duties. From Zhu Xingong to Cheng Zhenzhang, Zhang Sixu, and Jin Huating, one by one, they faced the enemy and puppets, relentlessly criticizing and never cowering! No wonder the senior figures in the journalism world, Mr. Chen Bulei and Zhang Jiluan, encouraged their colleagues in Shanghai who were fighting for national justice to be "first-class journalists."</p>
<p>Those who died heroically for their country deserve this praise, and those who survived that period of shocking and treacherous life also deserve this praise.</p>
<p>Colleagues in the occupied areas worked under the threat of pistols and bombs. In fact, colleagues in the rear, in addition to enemy air raids, air raid shelters, and subsidized rice, all chronically eroded the health of journalists, and their misfortune was no different. Today, as we mourn our fallen colleagues, we should also remember these living fighters who endured suffering.</p>
<p>One thing to be ashamed of is that in these eight years, we have not had a single colleague who died in battle. This fact shows that our efforts have been insufficient. If we had been able to grasp the war news reports more practically, perhaps at least one or two people would have lost their lives so gloriously. This statement is not cruel, and those colleagues who have had experience as war correspondents will admit it after a frank review!</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3 id="e125">General "Qiu Ba" Feng Yuxiang <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang has been ordered to go to the United States and departs today. Feng came from the rank of private second class, hence the nickname "General Qiu Ba" [literally: General Soldier]. The general's achievements today are entirely due to hard study. General Feng is going abroad today to investigate water conservancy, and it is hoped that he will contribute to post-war construction. Here, we briefly describe some of Feng's spirit of hard study and his anecdotes to express our admiration for the general.</p>
<p>Feng's family was poor, but his father, although he had pawned items in the past, did not neglect his son's education. Even in extreme difficulty, the family still hired a teacher. Therefore, Feng Yuxiang studied late into the night as a child and dared not slack off. But unfortunate encounters followed one after another. At the age of eleven, he lost his mother, and the family became even more difficult. Soon after, the teaching teacher was dismissed, and Feng was forced to drop out of school.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, he joined the army and often read books such as "The Case of Peng Gong" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Not Forgetting to Read While Serving in the Army</p>
<p>At that time, when Feng came across words he didn't know in books, he called them "roadblocks." He would temporarily ignore them and continue reading. When he finished a paragraph, he would settle the score with the "roadblocks." He would ask a cook in the camp about those new words. The cook knew more than him and became Feng's teacher. For decades, in his military career, Feng never stopped reading. Until August of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], when he took office as the Director-General of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army and resided in the Five Sages Shrine on Mount Tai for four years, this hard study was of great benefit to him throughout his life. When he came down the mountain, he was already very good at writing humorous poems and had excellent handwriting.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai War broke out in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], Feng took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, commanding generals such as Gu Zhutong, Chen Cheng, Zhang Fakui, and Zhang Zhizhong, leading troops to defend Greater Shanghai. At this time, General Feng was most delighted, because he was the first person in China to raise the anti-Japanese banner. As far back as the Battle of Xifengkou in the 13th year of the Republic [1924], he struggled against the Japanese invaders with broadswords against cannons, sparing no sacrifice.</p>
<p>Personally Going Out to Raise Donations</p>
<p>When the government moved west, he followed them to Chongqing and still liked to read and write articles. He promoted the Save the Nation Through Thrift movement in Sichuan, and no one was not moved by it. I remember that on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway in Neijiang, he called on hundreds of elementary school students to raise donations for the donation movement, asking them to collect donations from people in the streets and alleys. One day, a privately owned car crossed the road, and Feng ordered the elementary school students to stop the car to donate money. The students followed his instructions and stopped the car. A richly dressed lady was sitting in the car. The students asked her for donations, but she not only refused to give anything but also ignored them, and finally said, "I don't have any money." Later, one of the students reported to Feng, and he immediately went out in person. He said, "Do you really have no money?" She replied, "Really not." He then asked, "The War of Resistance is so tense and enthusiastic, prices are so high, and gasoline is so expensive, why are you driving a car? Do you know that a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood?" The lady had nothing to say. Feng then said, "You drive a private car and you don't have any money? You have no conscience. Okay, if you don't have money, please take off the gold ring and watch on your hand! Our hope is that those with money will give money, and those with strength will give strength!" The lady, knowing she was ashamed, took off the gold ring and watch. The people present at the time all admired General Feng's patriotic enthusiasm!</p>
<p>In Chengdu, he went to the Central Military Academy to give a speech on the donation movement. The officers and students who heard it were heartbroken, and the entire school donated 100,000 yuan from the savings they had accumulated from their daily allowances.</p>
<p>But Feng said, "Comrades in arms should not donate. Shedding blood and sweat is enough."</p>
<p>The Most Eloquent Speaker</p>
<p>Once, he gave a speech at the Shaocheng Public Office. Because the audience had different levels of understanding, he spoke in extremely simple terms. He said, "Our country has been at war for seven years. Leaving aside everything else, let's just take a machine gun. A machine gun's rate of fire is 250 rounds per minute. A machine gun's rate of fire is 250 rounds per minute. From July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937] to now, everyone calculate how many soldiers have sacrificed millions. So, how much ammunition does a machine gun consume, not to mention there's more than just one gun?" An old woman in the audience was so moved that she burst into tears and donated all her usual savings.</p>
<p>Now, General Feng is an old general in his sixties, so he is now semi-retired. But old and strong, he still wants to benefit China, because going to the United States to investigate water conservancy is also doing good for our future generations.</p>
<p>Currently, the general once told a reporter, "National affairs are like water conservancy. There are solutions for national affairs, and there are solutions for water conservancy." We hope that when the general returns home after completing his mission, there will be solutions for both national affairs and water conservancy!</p>
<h3 id="e126">China's Baojia System is Something India Wants to Learn <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, August 27: "Due to incessant riots throughout India and public security concerns, Interim Government Chairman Nehru has initiated the implementation of a system resembling China's Baojia system to prevent disturbances." That China's "national essence" has actually spread to foreign countries is naturally something that Chinese people view as "sharing in the glory."</p>
<p>Speaking of China's Baojia system, organizations similar to Baojia existed long before Wang Anshi.</p>
<p>The well-field system of 3,000 years ago was the beginning of the Baojia system. Chinese military strategist Jiang Baili once called it a "national defense system that can both cultivate fields and eat and send out troops to fight." Later, the Zhou Dynasty's so-called "five families as a bi, five bi as a lv, four lv as a zu" organization was slightly more precise than the well-field system. The reason why Duke Huan of Qi was able to "restrain the princes and rectify the world" was also due to Guan Zhong's Baojia law of "gui, li, lian, xiang." Qin Shang Yang advocated the "collective responsibility law," although its purpose was to control the people, it also achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>It was not until the reign of Xi Ning in the Song Dynasty that Wang Anshi created Baojia, which can be considered "magnificent in scale and profound in thought," but Wang's Baojia system was still slightly different from today's. In the first five matters, he stated the advantages of the Baojia system, specifically highlighting two: "Observing wickedness and revealing righteousness, and garrisoning troops while concealing their use." However, it was later opposed by all walks of life and did not succeed, but it finally left a concrete framework for the Baojia system to future generations.</p>
<p>After Wang Anshi, there were two people who successfully founded Baojia: one was Wang Yangming in the Ming Dynasty, and the other was Zeng Guofan in the Qing Dynasty. Both of them were just "scholars," but they made many contributions to the technology of implementing Baojia.</p>
<p>China's Baojia system was also stolen by Japan once: the incident occurred after the Sino-Japanese War. After Japan occupied Taiwan, the youths of the island refused to be oppressed and organized righteous armies to resist. The Japanese army repeatedly failed to suppress them and felt very troubled. Later, the "Civil Administrator" of Japan in Taiwan, named Goto Shimpei, learned from the old Chinese rules and strictly implemented the Baojia system. In a few years, the disputes in various places ceased without a fight, and it became a "royal way paradise." Looking back at our country, which has Baojia but does not use it well, it is truly a matter of great emotion!</p>
<p>India also wants to imitate our country in implementing Baojia, and we naturally welcome it. It is just that India today is full of domestic crises, and the government is still subject to the shackles of the British Empire. If the country cannot cooperate, and only learns China's Baojia system as a tool to "prevent disturbances," then it will greatly lose the original meaning of Baojia.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (4) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Si Dao Ai from Yu Qiang's Original</p>
<p>The Article Had No Sales</p>
<p>This book was completed in the spring of 1886, and in July the publisher Arrowsmith returned it unopened, having not even read the manuscript "sniffed it a few times and ran away." The editor of the friendly Cornhill Magazine, who had paid 30 pounds for a shorter story by Doyle, felt that this book was too short to be published as a standalone volume and too long to be published in the magazine. So, it was placed next to the "Advanced" "Ge De Ge Si Dong Company." The disappointed author himself wondered if perhaps other publishers would be fooled. The newly born Sherlock Holmes almost died at this point.</p>
<p>The Walter Locke Company received the tattered manuscript and read it once. Then, on the last day of October, Dr. Conan Doyle, sitting in the waiting room and smoking gloomily, received a letter:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir:</p>
<p>We have read your story and are very satisfied with it. We cannot publish it this year because cheap novels are flooding the market, but if you do not object to publishing it next year, we are willing to pay twenty-one pounds to purchase the copyright."</p>
<p>Even for the impoverished Dr. Conan Doyle, this was hardly an appealing proposal. But after many setbacks, and with a broken heart, he finally replied accepting it. Sherlock Holmes was entrusted to publishers, printers, and the world: A Study in Scarlet became a chapter in Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887. The author tells us in his autobiography that he never received another penny from this book. Had its author retained his name, Conan Doyle could have earned a considerable income from this small book due to its numerous reprints and translations around the world.</p>
<p>Today, the greyish paper of Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887 has become a rarity. The world's discerning bibliophiles regard it as a gem. Equally rare, and perhaps even harder to find, is the second edition of A Study in Scarlet with annotations by the author's father, Charles Doyle. This book was published in 1888, and the publisher also wrote a short preface, a masterpiece of inappropriate rhetoric and comparison.</p>
<p>Limited Royalty Income</p>
<p>At that time, contemporary British literature was very popular in the United States, for one simple reason: because there was no copyright law, it could be reprinted as much as possible without any cost. But even in this situation, publication created many people of prestige. Conan Doyle was also so famous. In England, A Study in Scarlet was quite popular with readers, but was criticized by the critics; but in the United States, it was an undoubted success.
