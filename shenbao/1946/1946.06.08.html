<h3>馬歇爾致函毛澤東　希望延安表示誠意　周恩來等返延會商大局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕停戰十五日之公報，由國府主席及中共代表分別發布後，京人士對中共之聲明交內所主「且談判必然牽運到東北乃至全國性的政洽問題需要更多時間」二語，雖不無拖泥帶水之感，但對中共一貫作風有歷一史性之認識者，僉信斯乃中共之政治術語。周恩來在未赴延安前，爲預防至延安碰壁，不妨拖一尾巴，以便卸責，而延安之中共總部爲中共最高次策機關，苟有停戰次心，謀和誠意，當不致作如是觀，如是言，故弄支虛，而失信於天下。現周恩來，陸定一已於今晨十時乘馬使專機逕飛延安請示。周氏行前曾於昨日兩晤馬使，對東北問題曁恢復交通問題作決定性之商討，傳馬使有親筆信一封，託周帶交毛澤東，內容不詳，衆信馬使業將聖潔之熱忱，最後之希望，寄諸延安矣</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕聞周恩來，陸定一已於今日下午五時許飛抵延安，中共總部已定八日舉行一重要會議，聽取周，陸報吿商談停戰經過，並討論對策。就中共總部過去行動硏究，最多在兩日以內，即可決定大計。聞周，陸行前語人，渠等在延安將有三四日勾留，最遲可望於十二日前返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕宋院長子文七日上午再度往訪馬歇爾元帥，就停戰令頒發後之新局勢有所會談，參政會秘書長邵力子及副秘書長雷震，對往訪之記者表示：渠等衷心樂觀，雷氏並稱：三人小組會必將於此半月內召開，商談實施政協決議之詳細辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕十五日停戰令，今日起已生效，一般人注意之對象，乃移主於象徵和平談判之政協小組與軍事三人小組將於何日復會茲據可靠消息，軍事三人小組，一俟周恩來自延安返京，即可重開。惟前次之政府代表徐永昌，原係暫代性質，此次仍將由陳誠親自出席。至政協小組之復會，必須視軍事三人小組商得初次協議，將大前提解次後方能賡續舉行。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕政協代表莫德惠·李璜·曾琦·陳啓天·黃炎培·羅隆基·梁漱溟·沈鈞儒等，七日下午三時集合，交換消息，並商討軍事及政治問題，未獲具體結論，定八日下午繼續商談。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京七日電〕政協秘書長雷震稱：東北停戰十五日期間，欲將多年來種種問題一舉解決，自感時間太短，但如雙方具有誠意，則大局日內可定。綜合小組在軍事三人委員會未成立初步協定前，不致繼續開會，本人對蔣主席東北停戰令極度樂觀，此次共產黨不致退出談判，憲草小組於軍事政治問題未獲解決辦法前，亦不致舉行正式會議。</p>
<p>〔又電〕馬歇爾特使暗示，周恩來或携有全國永久停止衝突之計劃大綱，此種偉大計劃在周恩來以軍事三人小組中共代表資格簽訂協定之前，自需得到中共政治局之批准。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京六日電〕今日共黨方面公然提出警吿，謂馬歇爾將軍之努力終將「無效」，除非美軍立即退出中國。國共間停戰十五日之一事，因此又發生搖動。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕實施改訂財政收支系統會議，七日上下午均分組舉行審査會，除第二組稅務，已審査完田賦糧食，第三組預算，尙未結束，定八日上午繼績開會審査，屆時如能審査完竣，下午則舉行大會，按照會議日程，原定八日下午閉幕，惟因提案過多，審查時間延長，故大會閉幕日期，將順延舉行。全部提案共一百零二件，其中以糧食部所提「實施改訂財政收支系統後關於田賦糧食之緊密措施案」財政部所提之「改訂財政收支系統後國地共有各稅征收劃撥交代程序案」「積極整理地方稅捐嚴社苛雜攤派，以裕自治財源而蘇民困案」及「調整卅五年下半年度省（市）縣（市）財政收支預算案」等四案最爲重要，審査時亦最爲愼重。</p>

<h3>東北調處工作待展開　長春設前進小組　白魯德鄭洞國曾有會商</h3>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕國共雙方停止前進之命令雖已頒布，但執行部束北調處工作之展開，猶有待方案之成立，東北執行小組派遣已逾兩月，即因缺乏可資依據之和平憲章，故躊躇徘徊，迄不能有所成就。白魯德飛長春，籌備執行部前進指揮所後，共方已決定派饒漱石爲其前進指揮所代表，今日即可由瀋飛長春。政府方商代表，昨傳由鈕先銘担任，惟今日蔡文治參謀長語記者，此事並未決定，政府將另派人前往，執行部東北四小組，現在瀋陽，四平街，撫順三地，將來可能再增加兩小組前往，惟必須待東北和平憲章確立後，始能出發展開工作。蔣主席之停戰命令，執行部係於昨日下午四時收到，一小時後即將命令下達東北小組，記者詢問政府當局此項停戰命令是否亦包括調動在內，發言人斷然謂，惟換防及運送給養應視爲例外。又訊，南京軍事三人會議，鑒於執行部工作亟待加强，已決定執行部除三委員外，另設副委員，以便襄助三委員工作，並於必要時代理其工作，惟三方副委員人選尙未發表。</p>
<p>〔合眾社本市訊〕洛杉磯時報記者德雷克，今日自長春來電稱：白魯德准將親在長春設立前進執行小組，因此美國從事中國和平問題之努力重心，今日起已自北平移往東北戰區之心　地點。白氏昨曾在此會晤東北國軍副司令鄭淸國中將，有所商談。</p>

<h3>爲千萬小學生請命！</h3>
<p>教育當局現在從事研究重訂小學課程標準。大家似乎並不覺得這件事的重要，可是它足以影響着每一個家庭的幸福。過去爲了家長們對教育制度，對學校課程，一些不注意，不研究，只讓幾專家生吞活剝的規定，結果，回頭看看今天我們家庭中兒童健康的情形怎樣？只要稍稍深刻觀察一下，我們真不禁爲之寒心。</p>
<p>小學課程標準，二十五年七月公布一次，三十一年十月修訂公布一次。今天全國小學中，所給予兒童的繁重無比的課程，自然經過許多專家的腦汁，而結果則犧牲了多數兒童的健康，甚至殘殺不少兒童的生命。一個十歲左右的小孩子，要讀十多門功課，課外還有種種活動，教脆弱的小孩子身體，怎樣可以支持得下，教身體特別瘦弱的中國小孩子，如何可以消化得下？在上海的小學校，還要變本加厲，除了教部所規定的課程以外，還要加上英文，甚或英法文都有，有的還要加些「經學」之類，而若干家長竟還讚美歌頌這些學校，殊不知這種學校在實際上似已變成了陷害兒童身心的牢獄。</p>
<p>假使今天我們有充分時間，把我們的小學課程和各國小學的課程來比較，則在繁雜與眾多的方面，我們當然會考第一！人家兒童的體格比我們好，人家兒童的營養也比我們好，人家兒童的家庭環境更比我們好，然而人家兒童所受的功課，並不比我們繁多。中國多數父母本身的贏弱，使我們的兒童在先天方面，已吃了一個大虧；出世以後，又爲了父母收入的微薄物價的高漲，使兒童萬難獲得標準的營養。而兒童回家以後，大多數的家庭環境，或一家人塵集斗室，使兒童沒有地方預備功課，或使兒童在教課以後，幫助家庭操作，爲父母替代勞役。中國兒童在這種不利的狀况下，怎樣可以比人家多讀得書？然而專家們不管，不管小孩子本身方面的能力怎樣，只顧自己專長的科目要加多鐘點灌輸，以致硬要小孩子把不可能完全接受的功課囫圇吞下。結果，五六歲肥肥胖胖的小孩子，一進入功課支配不良的學校，或反瘦弱起來，不特發育遲緩，面黃肌瘦，有的且在暗中生着嚴重的肺病。不信，請家長們各把自己小孩的身體和功課研究一下，這些功課是否小孩子能擔負得下？假使請醫師檢驗的話，是否有許多小孩子業已種下了若干可怕的病根？</p>
<p>强迫要一個五六歲以至十歲左右的小孩子，讀得成績比人家過分的好，這是一種極危險的古老觀念，由於這觀念，不知戕害了多少小孩的身體。我們有權要求專家們，切莫以爲只有本人專長的功課最要緊，鐘點應該最多，你也增，我也加，弄得課程標準成了不合理的「雜碎」。我們希望要把功課的種類合併，分量減少，尤其是上海許多小學，五六年級即有較深的英文，於兒童體格既不宜，國家立塲更不適合。課程標準既非如此規定，自應立即嚴加取締。今天小學課程過分繁重的弊病，一方面在無形中摧殘了無數小學生的身體，他方面也更影響到他們進中學大學以後的學業成績。爲了建國前途的整個教育着想，我們再也不能默爾面息。</p>
<p>最後，我們在這裏寄殷切期望於這次研究和討論修訂小學課程標準的「專家」，不可「專」而不「通」，再不要在舊的道路上徘徊瞻眺，救救千千萬萬的天真爛漫的小學生吧！他們一定得在繁重課程的枷鎖之下解放出來！</p>

<h3>香港淪陷後被俘　曾任「商統」理事　森康侯否認投偽　大呼冤枉　出讓合眾化學廠部份</h3>
<p>— 傳訊證　王植三</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕海上「三老」之一林康侯漢奸嫌疑案，昨日下午二時三刻，在提籃橋高院特刑一庭首度提訊。林衣藏靑色上衣，下著法蘭絨褲，裏面穿淡藍色細條子襯衫，繫一紫紅色與黑色相間之領帶，鼻架新式玻璃　草錄色太陽眼鏡，手持竹骨摺扇一把，頗有西洋紳士風度。被吿欄中之林康侯（　創　攝）</p>
<p>林　為上海人，七十歲，向在教育界，金融界服務。一度出任財政部常務次長，香港淪陷後，與李思浩等同時被捕，拘留香港，旋由敵機押回上海至卅二年三月，偽政府在滬成立「商統會」，林即充任該會理事兼秘書長。卅三年六月，任僞上海市諮詢委員會委員，在滬辦理救濟工作，並將與王植三等合辦了合羣化學廠原有製造酒精機器，以一百萬元代價讓予日方。但據林稱，檢察官所謂「變節投僞，」實屬寃枉。因在留滬期間，敵僞威脅利誘，均遭拒絕，故被偽方通緝，僞方發表之八十三名黑單中，第一名爲蔣伯誠，第三名即爲本人。因此，不能不逃香港。卅年太平洋大戰發生，香港淪陷被俘，禁凡一百零四天，仍不爲所屈，乃於卅一年四月十五日由日方押回上海。至六月間，猶因不爲日僞所滿，曾遭敵憲捕去。卅二年三月，偽商統會成立，指定理監事凡二十餘人，無有不被迫充任者，故被吿決非投僞，而由偽方以「有利於工商」爲由，強邀出任者。而事實上，自卅二年五月至卅三年六月，唐壽民任「理事畏」期內，爲實施物資統制與分配之期間，此時彼僅爲一掛名理事。及至卅三年七月，聞蘭亭長「商統會」後，四度邀林爲秘書長，謂欲將「商統」縮小範圍，裁撤冗員，竭力做保存工作。至去年八月十日結東，猶存一萬餘件棉紗，曾由聞蘭亭專電蔣主席，請示辦法，得覆電，命彼等妥爲保存。最後卒由經濟部派員全部接收。故不但未做物資之征收與分配工作，且曾爲國家保存物資。此時，即由被吿辯護人江一平律師提證二件：（一）聞蘭亭之親筆函一件，證明被吿在「商統會」秘書長任內，確實僅做事務工作。（二）汪逆僞政權所發通緝令中之黑單。</p>
<p>林　又自稱：在抗戰期間，被告身受頸，愛國之心，油然而生，故民國廿六年底第一個跑至重慶者即為被吿。而卅三年七月兼任秘書長後，把「商統會」中日籍職員一律裁撤。卅三年六月，任僞上海市政府諮詢委員，由於僞市長陳公博之聘請，不能推卸，而工作亦不過每月開會一次，由市政府報吿一月內之工作而已。被吿過去從事慈善事業，故亦担任救濟工作。至於合羣化學廠事，被吿於卅一年來滬後，即任董事，至卅二年底，極力幫助合羣抵制日方奪佔其製造酒精機器。後將該廠機器租予美利化學廠，並聘日人上谷爲顧問，以作掩護。結果因日方需用酒精，乃强以一萬萬元購之，此事與被吿並無關係。且被吿在該廠投資，僅三一五萬僞幣中佔六萬七千五，故爲小股東，與起訴書所云亦不相符。庭上傳訊證人王植三，鎭海人，四十八歲，爲合羣化學廠之股東，經詢問該廠之資本及機器等情後，即論改期再訊。昨日林之家屬曾出庭旁聽，但林並未請求接見。</p>
<h3>周邦俊　胖多了　提出許多反證</h3>
<p>周邦俊，江蘇常熟人，五十八歲，住新蘭路中華新邨十二號，一九〇九年畢業於美國敎會學校，曾歷任中央軍醫院院長，軍醫處處長，滬杭甬鐵路局總醫官，中西藥房經理，明星香水廠總經理等職。民國廿九年起，參加偽組織，充任中日文化協會會員，反英美協會會員，市保甲籌備處副主任等僞職。並以中西藥房之卡車，供敵軍用。該案於昨晨十時許，由曹駿推事升刑一庭開審，被告入庭時，衣藍布長衫，著黑皮鞋，發香略現嘶啞。據其供稱，偽中日文化協會有會員二三百人，均爲被迫拉入之各界名人，彼僅出席一次，因爲「做生意人對文化很少興趣，」，所以根本不做事，僅從報上得知該會曾舉辦一次書畫展覽而已至於「反英美協會」會員，據構亦爲强迫聘請，由「總幹事」陳亞夫請彼等赴國際飯店聚餐，當塲即成立該會，本不想加入，陳亞夫以日籍坂田書記官爲威脅，乃加人之，但並未參加跑馬應之「民衆大會」。周供：邦俊在民國元年即參加革命，向來是抗日的中堅份子，那裏會道樣喪心病在，去反英美。至於僞上海市保甲籌備會主任委員事，據供：民國三十一年陰歷年底，公共租界東區發生炸彈案六起，遂被日軍大封鎖，在西藏路，愛多亞路，北京路，外灘四周之內，居民不得出入，餓斃者亦時有所聞，狀至危險，乃以工商各界代表名義，組成「保甲委員會」向日方交涉，解除封，鎖於民有利，至保甲之實際組織，乃由僞警局辦理之，彼未做一事。嗣由法官問周與褚逆民誼之關係，據稱：「他的妹妹的小姐是邦俊的媳婦，但不大往來。一至於王永康之所以識褚民誼，並非彼之介紹，而因褚逆於卅三年間在南京建唐僧塔，王永康曾捐款，故識之。庭上乃論下次提王永康，當庭對質，至周以中西藥房卡車資廠事，謂係刧奪，固非自奉。最後、周復提出於彼有利之證據數件：（一）曾以三百萬元接濟軍令部在滬之電台，（二）曾救濟抗戰殉難家屬，由杜剛夫人陸惠民律師到庭作證，（三）曾捐助軍委會軍裝一干套，曾救助英人福開森，（四）曾輔助同德醫學院，（五）曾營救畢高奎。庭諭改期傳訊證人，再行審訊。退庭後，周邦俊接見家屬，其女。姪輩均謂「九月不相見，胖多了。」周即笑答曰：「沒有關係，這不過是一個風浪罷了。」</p>

<h3>屋荒貧窮無知——造成霍亂猖獗　陸家浜危機四伏</h3>
<p>「大戰之後，必有大疫！」這句話，恐怕今年要在上海應騐了。請問問上海隨便那一位耆老，幾曾見過霍亂在端午以前就開始流行的？儘管天文台的報吿說是今年夏天不致於太熱，可是事實證明：這幾天就熱得和伏中天氣差不了多少，再加上亢旱不雨，正是霍亂最容易猖獗的時候！　屋荒。貧窮，無知！更爲霍亂造成了活躍的機會。上海的高樓大厦並不少，可是，戰爭帶來了貧窮！在閘北，在南市，正有許許多多人家，在過着地獄一般的生活！</p>
<p>我要舉一個實例。在南市陸家浜菜塲附近，有一個佔地很廣的土墩。這土墩的來源是很容易推測的：土墩的底層有整齊的的屋基，在戰前當然也是好好的房子。日本兵進來之後，南市大火，這些房十就變成了一堆瓦礫。在這瓦礫堆上，附近的居民天天把垃圾一畚箕一畚箕的倒上去，眞是集砂成塔，到現在，垃圾，糞便，和原來的瓦礫愈積愈多，已經有七八尺高了。</p>
<p>於是，那些住不起高樓大厦的苦入們，就在高墩前面，搭了十來間草棚，這些草棚必須緊靠這土墩，因爲這土墩本身就可以代替一垜墻壁，他們可以省下幾張蘆席。他們簡簡單單的搭了一個竹架子，把蘆蓆舖上去，上面蓋些草，就算是「結廬在人境」了。這些棚子並不是獨立的，祗是用蘆蓆隔成小問，每一間就是一家。最大的一家，橫裏的開關是十一英尺，深度大槪還不到十尺，沒有窗，沒有陰溝。</p>
<p>而這些棚戶，多數都是出賣食品的！他們在門口作大餅，油條，餛飩，有一家居然還賣飯。蒼蠅嗡嗡亂飛，濃痰隨地亂吐。但是，倒每天生涯鼎盛！</p>
<p>隔着那個土墩，和那些棚戶遙遙相對的，是一幢很高很大的房子。雪白的圍墻上，寫着七八尺見方的大字：「南市殯儀館」。</p>
<p>從這土墩再向南十六七步，就是天天擠滿了顧客的陸家浜菜塲場。每天早晨，總有許多菜根果皮又堆上了那個土墩；每天早晨，總有許多主婦從這些草棚裏的攤上，買些天餅油條回家，作爲早點。</p>
<p>如果霍亂蔓延到了這樣的地方，怎麽辦？須知上海的棚戶不止這一處！</p>
<p>把他們趕出來罷，又叫他們到那裏去？南市現在正大興土木，而這些新房子祗是比那些棚子造得高了一些，屋頂的蓆爿變成了瓦片，四面塗上上了一層黃泥。萬一發生火警，間然是不堪設想，而霍亂要一流行起來，這裏是絕對談不到隔離的！</p>
<p>老百姓大多不肯打防疫針，他們說，「日本人去了，還打什麽針！」我想，這是應該强制注射的時候了！（平齋）</p>
<h3>「五金大王」張蓮舫　曾以鋼鐵呈獻敵軍</h3>
<p>號稱「五金大王」之張蓮舫，寗波人，四十七歲，住福煦路四明邨一一六號，設恒大祥五金號於上海。民國廿五年起，任五金業同業公會主席。卅年底，上海五金業在偽方鉗制下成立所謂五金鋼鐵聯合辦事處，張即任該辦事處五金組主任，曾向同業徵收鋼鐵五金，呈獻於敵海軍部者有一千二百多噸，陸軍部方面亦達七八百噸。嗣於僞黃浦區第二聯保第六保保長及偽上海特別市五金同業公會理事長任內，亦倡導獻鐵，於敵有利。昨日提訊時，張猶强辯謂：獻鐵乃全市各保長共有之事，被追而爲之，且從未出席任何保長會議云。</p>
<p>李浩駒等</p>
<p>此外同日另訊數人，為偽郵政總局駐滬辦事處主任李浩駒，廣東人，據其供稱，戰前爲駐馬尼刺總領事，其外甥爲在逆精衛之女婿，原做生意，後經陳逆君慧之「勸導」，乃投僞入郵政局云。又敵情報員馬樂，僞特工無綫電機務科長周鼎，僞江蘇省政府參議錢介一等，亦經報訊一過，均論改期再訊。</p>
<p>又新新公司總經理李澤案，今日宣判。</p>
<p>邱俊連判刑後交保</p>
<p>又邱俊連漢奸嫌疑案，早經審理終結，昨日宣判，邱俊連通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國，處有期徒刑二年半，褫奪公權二年，全部財產除酌留家屬必需之生活費外，沒收。惟邱以犯罪行爲較輕，准予交保釋放。聞此猶爲高院審奸以來之創舉。</p>

<p>本市米價於四月十五日後急劇飛漲，最高會一度竄至六萬三千一石，中央乃特派大員來滬澈査，並即將有囤積居奇嫌疑之三泰米行純理吳蓉生，長江企業公司副經理王巽之，會計員王美樂，營業主任莊漢章等四米蠶，予以扣押，經旬餘偵査，已獲得該各米蠶利用糧貸投機囤積之確證，乃於前日下午五時，轉解警備司令部軍法處，將依非法常時期違反糧食管理暫行條例，予以嚴辦。據記者探悉：該四條米蛀虫危害民食之罪嫌及其利用糧貸之經過如：（一）長江企業公司於四月十五日取得糧貸六千萬元後，在松江一帶搜購食米一千八百四十八石五斗運滬，囤儲倉棧，達一月之久，始以高價出售一部份，此外，並査得本遵令登記秘密堆存於各倉庫之食米共有二千〇十七包，又一百五十石，現均已由我軍事當局全部査封。（二）三泰米行經理吳蓉生，於五月初奉糧政處委托拋售存米一萬一千包，欲以壓平米價，詎吳遷延句日，米價飛漲，旋於五月十一日開始至廿二日，十三日中拋出四千五百卅包，惟其中依法售與零售米店者僅半數，致米價仍直綫飛漲，吳某得從中獲鉅額不法利潤，且共所售得之款項，復不即解糧部，而存入中央信託局，以資週轉運用，其餘未拋出之存米則以「三泰」名，囤於倉庫，以圖居囤牟利。聞軍法處對該案於昨晨已開偵査庭，提訊吳蓉生等四條米　，並將於日內公布該案全豹。又訊糧貸審核小組委員會委托大明會計事務所淸査十六家糧貸商之賬册，通吿十六家糧貸商，即日將全部有關賬册送交淸査。</p>
<p>本市當局舉辦遣送德僑事宜，聞外交部已經分別通知各該德僑，遵照準備，而由市政府執行集中，分批登輸運送回國。首批人數，約近千人。此輩德人不盡屬政府官吏及納粹黨員，甚至夙不開問政治，專營商業者，亦槪在遣送之列。査政府處理德僑辦法，對於技術人員曁其他善良份子，原有可以請居留中國之規定。若輩甚多辦過登記，相保，申請等手續者，現旣一律遣送，則前定手績，等於無效，頗多德人有莫知所可無所適從之苦。且幷有少數申請歸化者，更有祖孫三代僑華經商，或在中國生長者，已目上海爲第二故土，一且事業盡隳，蕭然離去，不無感　系之。聞本市熟悉德僑情形之若干名流，僉以在抗戰期內，資源內移，或有賴德人出面掩護者，更有中央官吏，地下工作人員，賴德人營救出險者，亦未嘗無之，現在一律遣送，似失公　標準，有失天國風度。政府宜就小國立塲，規定德僑去留標準，各個一甄別，例者宜予遣送，何者宜准居留，何者應准膚化，其　　　　，化者，並應另定覓保辦　，以流弊。果能如此辦理，則德人更可心悅誠服云。</p>

<h3>加強本市交通　公共汽車將增加路綫車輛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市區交通混亂，行路困難，記者昨特走訪市政府公用局，據張副局長仁滔稱：公用局鑒於原有車輛不敷應用，曾向「行總」購車，然因該車不適目前之需要，故現已改向上海物資供應局購得卡車四十五輛，經改造後，將作公共汽車之用。預計本月底可裝就十餘輛，即可供用，路綫尙未決完。惟此種車輛原係臨時補救性質，將來交通復原後，將被遣至市郊作次要之用。至於日前盛傳擬向美國購置柴油汽車一項實屬不確。張副局長繼稱：上海市公用局公共汽車籌備委員會至遲於下月可吿成立，資本約爲十萬萬元，係官商合辦，將購大量公共汽車。届時租用英法原有路綫使用。</p>

<h3>來源增多人心漸定　米市塲空氣平和　青黃不接時期可以穩渡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧食問題，自當局嚴厲查辦以後，日見和緩，持貨者紛紛出籠，各路來源，又復蟬聯不斷，市價一路向下，與上月暴漲之情形，適得其反，惟一般市民對於過去興風作浪之米　仍切盼當局能從嚴處置，以敬效尤，現悉留滬之一千噸洋米，昨（七日）晨已正式卸下，暫存糧食部倉庫，如何分配，須候糧食部令到以後，再行處理，其餘二千二百噸，日內卽運葫蘆島，接濟華北民食，前傳運京之說不確，又糧部訂購之洋米，已分批啓運，卽將陸續到滬，據吳市長表示，滬市糧食供應，渠已有十分把握，根據近况，可安度此青黃不濟之三個月時期，對於觸犯糧管條例之米商，及非米商而經營米糧者，定予嚴懲。</p>
<p>又訊，中國糧食工業公司部經理江漢　現仍在滬，主持進行訂購洋米事務，該公司現仍設渝，卽將在滬設立一新機構，負責採購洋米，以及其他各項有關業務，並定日內派要員赴美國，轉往南美各地考察，據悉擬行訂購糧米之地點，爲巴西智利阿根廷伊柯托拉等地，間洋米進口時所有進口關稅可以完全免除云。</p>
<h3>粳秈又續小三五千元</h3>
<p>昨日米市以天時漸熱，消化仍滯，蕪湖南京客秈來源湧旺，跌勢甚烈，約小四五千元，粳米下等亦小三四千元，高貨小一二千元，白元小二千元，麵粉步削千元，麩皮再降四五百元，黃豆依然平疲，略小數百元至千元不一，苞米赤豆均呆，小麥芝蔴無甚軒輊，新　豆連日猛跌之後，爲價已低，另化見納一一千元，濁市平平，昨日據米市塲崽，共四千餘石，白元一九五石，薄石數如下，白粳二七一七石，羊秈一〇六石，白元一九五石，薄稻九三三石，杜秈二四五石，陰元一五石，早稻六八七石，蕪秈九〇石。</p>
<h3>公價空頭活動</h3>
<p>公債昨稍恍惚空方壓力加重，多方亦欲摛先縱，統丙晨開在做手故意抬高下，竟喊高至六五〇〇元，極不易賣，不久卽逐步退落，出籠極湧，空方機壓迫，中途逐步跌至五七〇〇元，始見穩定，午刻在五八五〇元左右結果較前收回跌四〇〇元，收後復喊高至六千元外，甲乙亦跌二百元，丁種四百元，戊種亦跌三百元。</p>
<h3>金價微跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍被美鈔帶俏，晨開雖因停戰令頒發，一部份多頭有所了結，自一八三萬五陸續下挫至一八一萬五，然因本埠人心，有一部份對黃金外匯雖有和平消息，亦有看好之見解，逢低吸收有人，不久稍形轉穩，十時後在一八三萬强徘徊，中行配給業中一三六條，價一八三萬，此後美鈔越盤越好，間接助長金市買氣，午前曾回漲至一八六萬外，午刻在一八五萬五光景，午後稍形鬆動，中行力售下，最後被迫稍挫，結果較前收跌二萬，鉓金十九萬，紋銀二千二，銀元微穩，暗拆銀根更　，息價一角三分左右。</p>
<h3>外匯感受約束後　美鈔結款忙</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔極告吃香，結進備用者紛至沓來，晨開二三七〇元左右，開後一度受金市下游，微降至二三五〇元以下，迨夫情勢稍穩，結款紛來，遂再告盤漲，以致近午漲到二四九〇元而後略平，午後稍有外商供售而微降，結果較前收升五十元，港滙微平，四三〇元，羅比亦然，五二五有售，美匯明平暗緊，不易成交。</p>
<p>布市平穩</p>
<p>布市客方對於冬季貨品需要依然不弱，因此情態尚能立定，坯布籌碼未見大鬆，但染廠方面連日搜羅不少，目前受根率制採辦不若以前興奮，同時中紡供給稍增，但熱門貨仍不踴躍，所以趨勢和平，各檔行情升降互見。</p>
<h3>紗市榮辱互見　現棉交易甚佳</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，二十支縷馬始則向昂二萬，成交一百二十六萬，銅以廠方有意供售，價復降落，二十支小型紗執貨者脫貨心切，約跌一萬，午時紡建照例開紗，對市上需要之二十支熱門貨已有雲鵬陽鶴藍鳳三牌供售，同行心思淡泊，開單承購者，已不若以往之踴躍，四十二支開價又較上期降十四萬，其餘各支亦减低二萬至十萬。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉微跌二至五磅音，計近期美金二八·二四，遠期二八·六三，米特林現貨二八·八四，本埠現棉交易續佳，計嘉照福新及內地小型廠均有採辦，市價漲一二千元。</p>
<h3>美國取消限價後　白金暴漲</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕自物價管制局取消管制後，白金價格，已由戰時每盎斯三十五元之限價漲至五十六元，平均增加百分之六十。又蘇聯白金產量最多，其政府代表在合意之價格下，方允輸出，此外南美洲及英國，亦爲白金之補給地云。</p>
<h3>暴漲過度·多頭出籠　華股昨開始回跌　外股譜由平穩轉疲</h3>
<p>華股昨冷股上塲，竟漲達沸點，某銀行對冷門小股，若新亞中法內衣世界猛力搜購，操業之拥客幫，故意哄抬，以致中法內衣，竟迫近三百元，新亞藥廠一五〇，較隔前猛　達三成左右，究以暴漲過度，不久即被業中存多所擊落，回跌亦快，熱門股遂缺乏依賴，亦告回控，近午最疲，結果較上週六紗微降，美亞景福跌半成，新光勤興則雖跌而不多，冷門各股中型信用榮豐回落關成，中紡大中華微挫，小型中法新亞內衣仍告微漲，元老股仍穩。</p>
<p>外股初穩後疲，多方仍無意久持，怡紗晨開在一二八〇〇元左右盤旋，開後漸出不支趨怯疲，英聯等亦然，近半都暴低價，結果較前收　計怡紗英聯紙業各跌一成左右，餘者雖跌而不多。</p>
<h3>煤價續疲</h3>
<p>鴻基層配價減　焦炭熟煤亦跌</p>
<p>煤市各貨交易均稀，人心疲軟，行情一致看疲，僅烟煤層稍有做開，焦炭有熟煤前最高價達五六十萬元，近因到貨充斥及實銷呆滯，行情迅速回跌至廿萬元，穩站頗久，現亦受白煤下跌影響，跌進二十萬元關，又經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會經煤球製造同業中請減低製球原料鴻基層配價，業已核准。價較前低一萬爲十一萬元，浦東碼頭煤棧交貨。</p>
<h3>皮貨暢銷紐約</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕此間東林公司最近出售中國皮貨，基售價除少數略高外，大部與市面水準相同，聞現已售出其存貨之半數，市面黑紫羔皮貨，需求最殷，四萬六千張定貨中，百分之五五，業已現價售出，售價最高爲美金四元，平均價則爲三·七五羔羊皮，四千張定貨中，百分之九四亦經脫售，價在七·五〇與八·五〇美元之間，最高售價爲九·七五元。因運輸方面之運量限制，致浙江羔羊一一·五〇〇張，日本水獺皮一〇·〇〇〇張，中國黃狼皮四三·三〇〇張之百分五〇，均未行出脫，該公司另售出其存貨，菲洲波斯羔皮七六·〇〇〇張，售價比三月份高百分之十二·五，最高價爲美金二一元云。</p>
<h3>日本木材　麥帥今日政府　按月運交中國</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京七日電〕麥帥總部今日下令日本政府，將日本此後所出木料題交中國之上海與秦皇島。該部經濟與科學組之進出口部份聲稱：按月將有木料兩萬五千石，運往秦皇島，乙萬石運往上海。按日本之石，約合十立方英尺。</p>
<h3>世界小麥產銷狀况　需要達七萬八千四百萬美斗　供給量只有四萬八千三百萬</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕關於裝運小麥至護謹區域一事，政府最近採取兩種措置：第一，政府對於運到穀倉之小麥一律微發百分之二十五。第二，支加哥小麥之限價每美斗提高一角五分，外加政府對五月二十五日以前出口之小麥給予特別獎金三角，合計增加四角五分。此項措置將進行至若何程度，尚未可知。</p>
<p>小麥在救濟世界糧荒計劃中佔有重要之地位，一九四五年歐洲各國食糧中之加路里（熱量單位）半由毅物供給，而美國之數字則僅爲四分之一，觀此可知小麥之重要，且穀類之裝運出口較肉類及牛乳製品爲簡便。一九四六年上半年各地需要進口之數量，估計約七萬三千二百萬美斗。，加以食米代用品共需二千一百萬噸，共需七萬八千四百萬美斗。</p>
<p>生產剩餘國家裝出之小麥約計四十七萬美斗，又據美國農業經濟局三月底所作估計，各該國在下半年中或將運出三萬七千五百萬至四萬三千五百萬美斗。此期間內可以利用之剩餘穀物（食米除外），估計出產小麥國家，即美國，加拿大，阿根廷，澳洲，合計三七五—四三五百萬美斗，生產玉蜀黍，燕麥及大麥之國家，計美國，加拿大，阿根廷，巴西，其他國家，合計四八百萬美斗。</p>
<p>關於美國如何能達到二萬二千五百萬美斗之出口目標一點，倘一月至六月期間供詞料及種子用之小麥能减至九千萬噸，同時七月一日以後之　存量能减少至一萬五千萬美斗，則可獲四萬四千萬美斗供國內消費及出口之用。美國國內需要量約計二萬五千萬美斗，尚餘不足二萬萬美斗供出口之需。本年最初三個月中，裝出之小麥約計一萬萬美斗。故目前美國政府所面臨之問題似爲如何轉移供飼料及國內應用之小麥以補足二千五百萬美斗之額外需要量，俾達二萬二千五百萬美斗之出口目標。即使在兩個月中能獲成功，但需要量七萬八千四百萬美斗與供給量四萬八千三百萬美斗，其間差額仍無法彌補。</p>
<h3>綢貨交易頻繁　人造絲已轉堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市價已呈堅穩之象，一二〇號天橋有光現貨，上午做價最小三十·三十一萬元，最大三十一·三十三萬元，下午仍做三十萬元，與上日價同，雜牌貨有交易，價均同好一二萬元，廠絲高勻度做開甚穩，喊價與前兩日不相上下，用戶絲亦頗堅穩，干經價略升四五萬元，五擔貨在五十萬元左右。綢貨交易頻繁，價遂擁進，美亞被面昨上午做一百三十八萬元，比上日大八萬元，大誠格子　　做四千八百八十元，下午出五千元關外，其餘盛杭各貨俱亦報漲。</p>
<h3>大批報紙到滬　木材火油汽車　亦有大量裝到</h3>

<p>紅綠茶花色，自本街店荘天津蘇州無錫等地之買風連編進展以來，趨勢本亟銳利，近日復有楓漢幫亦來問津，故應將人心激挺，握貨者喊價大都轉秀，台灣紅茶祁門茶芯俱叩新高價，餘則比前各露鋒芒，至於洋荘茶市，目前僅恃菲洲摩洛哥一帶對於呂質優良之珍眉尚垂青睞，怡和洋行猶與貨主談盤，其他各國則沉靜無聲。</p>

<h3>四平街長春間　如何進入國軍掌握</h3>
<p>— 本報廿三日瀋陽航訊　特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>四平街的進入國軍掌握，馬上打開了東北的沉悶，同時這也正是國軍開入長春的序幕，從這一次軍事上的高速度發展，奠定了國共間政治上折衝接近的根據。</p>
<p>從四平街開始，接二連三的公主嶺，西安，伊通，遼源，奉化，（製樹），郭家店　大大小小的據點，一連串的從共軍手中退出，跑入國軍的懷抱；這都在說明長春的必要命運。</p>
<p>四平街，經過了兩個月的佔有，市外郊野，構築了重重陣地，碉堡戰壕，息息相通，鐵軌鋼板都被利用了，駐兵人數，也極眾多，原有計劃必需死守，因爲共軍曾目此爲「斯大林格勒」也。</p>
<p>國軍北路自攻下鐵嶺，，開原，昌圖等地以後，北進逐陷於停頓狀態，　裏固然是遭遇到了許多困難，此外則在從新佈置，等待生力軍，以便對付所傳共軍擺在正面的龐大兵力。</p>
<p>自從三月下旬，國軍分三路沿中長鐵路南北以及東面的撫順綫推進以來，在指向長春的北路，是由穿着美式服裝的孫兵團負責，賈副軍長奉領着這批多半生長在東南的健兒前進，鐵嶺，開源，昌圖，一路上遇到許多艱難和困苦，此外，那就是令我們痛心的戰鬥了，結果是克服了艱苦，得到了戰事上的勝利。</p>
<p>担任右翼的廖兵團　縱湘將軍，起先是親率軍隊執行接收瀋陽到營口間艱钜任務的，結果在困難重重的環境下，打到了海邊的營口，現在又調到北路上來，左翼的陳明仁兵團，係屬生力軍，三路合作，達成了此番任務。</p>
<p>各路軍隊，迫向四平街，在國軍方面，是十四日下的命令，共軍在初本打算以蘇軍保衛「斯大林格勒」的精神，保衛四平街，但僅在四平街外團幾個據點接觸後，就發生了動搖，記者雖無法獲得共軍方面的資料，但似乎在於他們鑒於國軍勢在必取，迂廻部隊，又急急前進，加上自己的不利情形，知大勢已去，乃作急　的撤退。</p>
<p>十九日天米明時，共軍自四平街西北角上，衝出其最後一批人馬，國軍於當日拂曉圍入市內，於是這一塲目前東北國共軍勝負攸關的四平街戰事，幸而未作大流血，民眾生命財產也未作大犧牲的結束了最後的一幕。</p>
<h3>豆的都市　地位極關重要</h3>
<p>四平街是遼北省的省會，同時也是四平街市所在地，中長路貫穿南北，東有平梅路—四平街至梅河口，西有平齊路—四平街西北通齊哈爾，這三條鐵路幹綫，在四平街劃了一個大什字，南達海濱，北接蘇聯，東通時鮮，西連蒙古，結果把這裏造成了一個交通捷便和形勢重要的一個殖區。</p>
<p>市區面積頗大，人口約八萬八千余人，省市的設立，造成了四平街的繁榮，商工業日見發慶，因而人口由六萬增加到了上述的數目字。</p>
<p>但繁榮的主因，則在於交通和農產，四平街省正在遼北沃　的中心，大豆，高粱，包米—玉蜀黍的產量極豐，四平街市火一大集散地，有「東山穀倉地帶」的舉呼，又因以大豆特多，是以又有「豆的都市」的美名，今後對於國際農產貿易上，也佔有重要的地位。</p>
<p>四平街附近煤礦和石灰礦頗多，工業方面，有製粉廠，油坊等，其中油坊較多，是以又有「油化工業」的美譽。</p>
<p>四平街市內，原先以「中長鐵路」縱貫而分「道裏」和「道外」兩區，西爲道裏，東爲道外，兩區都沒有戰事殘痕，商店也都開業了，車站則例外，新創舊疤，宛然在目，橫越鐵路的跨綫橋也毀壞了，從外表看來，四平街還沒有多大的創傷，但在精神和物資上，所受損害，當甚嚴重。遼北省主席劉輪東，市長楊祝孫，都已在二十日到達四平街，並且宣示即行着手復興工作。</p>
<h3>長春前衛　險要的公主嶺</h3>
<p>各路國軍積極推進，廿一日中路先以快速部隊迂回至公主嶺以北地帶，大部神速開進公主嶺，西路迫向遼源，車路進入伊通，另一部東南向進入西安，西安煤之埋藏量，據調查有五億公噸，市區有規模頗大之火力發電廠，共軍撤退時，擬加以破壞，所幸時間來不及，及工人阻撓等關係，尚完整如初，如能善加利用，發電量爲十二萬　羅瓦特，可解決瀋陽部份的電荒。</p>
<p>公主嶺，是長春的前衛都市，正當遼河流域和松花江流域的分水嶺，北由懷德南至通陽，蜿蜒几百數十公里的古代層的邱陵地帶，在軍事上有險可守，偽滿在民國卅一年設市，市區面積爲八百六十四平方公里，人口約五萬餘人，在工業上有油坊，造酒，碾米，煉瓦等工廠。</p>
<p>本報特約記者（第二人）由長返　後與中共代表　漱石（右第三人）伍　　（右第一人）晤談後攝</p>
<h3>兼程猛進　長春重現曙光</h3>
<p>中長鐵路南北縱貫市街中心，鐵路南北，由長約八十六空的大橋，跨越鐵路，連接商業區和舊市區，商樂區多特產商，舊市區則多舊式住宅，偽滿時「公主嶺國立農事試驗塲」頗著稱。共軍失掉了公主嶺，長春馬上暴露出來正面的孫兵團，急由四平街兼程猛進，計二十日抵郭家店，廿一日抵公主嶺，廿二日抵范家屯，廿三日繞到了長春的左翼。在這時候瘳兵團的部隊，更以閃電式的姿態，於廿三日正午開入長春市，長春要地，於是投進國軍懷抱，重爲中央所治轄。</p>
<p>四平街和長春之間，經過了這次軍事上的急速轉變，所幸流血尚不十分慘烈。比較觸目驚心的，是共軍炸毀了四平街南北的鐵路橋，燒掉了公路上的磚石木架橋，長春以南則因在時間上是不許可了。</p>
<p>東北軍事上的行動究竟會展開至幾時？政治上的談判何日得能成功？是人人關心的事，而東北人民尤有切身之痛，好在從種種方面看，東北局勢已經雨露出了和平的曙光，或者就是黎明的時候了！</p>
<h3>長春廿九天</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵慎之</p>
<p>東北共軍現在已統一組織，號稱卅萬的「民主聯軍」是一個謎，目前正在不斷擴充中。我們在長春只看見說山東話的八路軍，在街頭到處看到「歡迎投軍」，「投軍報名處」的打字，寫在牆壁上、</p>
<p>根據周保中在廿五日晚上與我們暢談時宣佈，「民主聯軍」的組織部份有三種：一是八路軍，由彭真率領，二是前身為「東北抗日聯軍」的「東北人民自衛軍」，由周保中率領，周自稱有十五萬到廿萬人。未明確數，三是新四軍和舊東北軍，新四軍只有千名人，由林彪率領。　東北軍則有呂正操張學良萬毅等率領。呂正操宣佈：他們統率的東北軍人數，現在是整整十萬人。</p>
<h3>東北局之宴</h3>
<p>總的領導機構是「民主聯軍總司令部」，總司令林彪，副司令是呂正操，周保中，蕭勁光，政委是彭真，羅榮桓。周是東滿軍總司令，呂是西滿軍總司令。這些武力，可以說完全在日本投，降以後出現在東北的。</p>
<p>如張學思對記者說：他出關時在去年九月，率舊東北軍人數不過二千餘，現在却已有二萬五千人。這在另一節裏要特別談到。八路軍新四軍不說了。周保中特別申明一點，共軍只有在蘇軍不到的地方才去。</p>
<p>至於「東北人民自衛軍」據周保中稱：其前身爲東北抗日聯軍，「抗日聯軍是在一九三五年成立的」。他說：「東北人民革命軍和各地游擊隊，經過改編，統一指揮，組成十一個軍。不斷和日軍作戰，一九三八年開始，日軍不斷向我們「討伐」，是年冬天和一九三九年全年，聯軍遭受重大損失。凡和抗日聯軍有關係的村落，燒殺殆盡。如東滿撫松一縣櫃人參的散戶五六千家，（每家十人上下），即完全爲敵人毀減，僞三江省，牡丹江省，燒燬民房達八十萬所。這時抗日聯軍到達最困難時期，幾乎完全生活於水天雪地　山密林間，吃一頓飯必須以血肉換取。聯軍將領楊靖宇，趙尚志等，即在一九三九至四一年間戰死，謝文東·李華堂等則降敵」。</p>
<p>抗日聯軍在一九四一年可說完全垮了。周保中說這時只能「埋藏起來，進行潛伏活動，和化整爲零的分散活動」。</p>
<p>至此以後，即一九四一年到一九四五年，根據周保中說：在吉東森林地帶北滿東西興安嶺，五年之間，還有幾次戰鬥。周保中以此證明東北抗日聯軍是仍存在着的。周保中本人現在出現在長春，回我們談着話，他就是抗日聯軍第五軍長。他的口頭語是：「我在東北同日本仔打了十四年」。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯對日宣戰以後的情形，他在另一次談話中說：「滿洲情形突起變化，東北抗日聯軍復轉向進行，廣泛與積極活動，極力擴大此愛國力量　應紅軍，並發動敵後戰爭，並於蘇軍佔領區幫助維持秩序，溝通中蘇友好，進行民主建設，現僅東滿北滿聯軍已達十五萬人」。</p>
<p>廿五日我們還在不自由中，周保中到我們寓所來，自是我上八時談起，吃晚飯後再談，一直談到十二時半，我們問他爲何要攻長春？他答覆說：</p>
<p>「二月四日至九日，國軍佔了盤山台安，這時中共中央同意國軍接收蘇軍撤退後的瀋陽長春哈爾濱，共軍向鐵道兩邊各擴卅里，惟須以協商方式解決東北問題。中共中央通知我們，三月五日前，三人小組可能到東北來，結果沒有來，三月中國軍複攻撫順營口鞍山本溪湖，三月十五日到廿日，中共中央每家有電報來說：「和平已無望」，國軍又北進開原。我們處處挨打。長春離吉林很近。長春的保安隊是僞軍改編的，過去曾和我們作戰，我曾負傷五次，都是這批鐵石部隊打的，他們被政府改編，我們已不滿了，僞軍可以進長春，我們打了十四年日本仔的反沒有資格進長春？而他們駐地離吉林不過四十公里，爲了自衛，必取採取行動，於是我向東北局提出了意見，決定進攻長春」。</p>
<p>五月一日中共東北局　來長春，我們就看到了東北局書記彭真以及呂正操和張學思。據凱豐告訴慎之，林彪正在四平街前綫。</p>
<p>中共東北局一到長春，對我們態度就完全改變了。</p>
<p>開始是長春市的新市長劉居英，在五月二日請我們在大和旅館喫飯，劉居英離居主人地位，但默無一語，只有周保中的說話，他在席間告訴我們東北九省中有民選主席的已有八省，他發表的名單如下：</p>
<p>遼寗：張學思，吉林：周保平，安東：高重民，嫩江：於毅夫，車相臣（副）黑江：李延祿，松江：馮仲雲，遼北：栗又文（副）興安：尚無。</p>
<p>其中有已選出的正主席或副主席，不知他們肯不肯來，或者人並不在東北，所以他不願告訴我們。</p>
<p>五月四日，東北局在東北飯店請我們喫飯，這一個飯館的佈置不似商人的佈置，而是政工人員的新佈置，走道壁上有　　，餐室喪有朱德，毛澤東的畫像，中間是孫中山像。</p>
<p>彭真是延安來的中共委之一，林彪，陳雲，羅榮桓，呂正操，也是中委，同是東北局委員，周保中非中委，但也是東北局委員之一。</p>
<p>彭真個子高高，山西人，有燕趙　，面色紅潤，談吐中政治立塲嚴謹，而語調溫和。他說：</p>
<p>「東北九省中，八個省已有省參議會，除開蒙古部份。關于蒙古，我們讚成他們實行地方自治，根據第一次全國代表大會宣言原則。正像美國一樣，國旗上有許許點點，這許多點點正如各個民族，那麼中國就可成爲一個和睦的國家。」</p>
<p>他中答覆關於蒙古問題的詢問中說：「蒙古人中還沒有共產黨」。</p>
<p>關於蒙古自治問題，中共並未獲悉詳情，但呂正操說：自治運動的領導人物爲博彥滿都，過去在僞滿時代，他是僞興安南省長。</p>
<p>慎之就問：「博彥滿都，是僞政府官吏，他現在去幹自治運動了，那麼依照中共的政策，是不是有不符合的地方」？</p>
<p>彭真，呂正操就回答說：「這要看蒙古人民的意思來決定，與我們無關。蒙古人民要擁護他，我們不能阻止」。</p>
<p>我們又問：</p>
<p>「東北九省，目前在共軍掌握中的有幾分之幾？」</p>
<p>這時在座的有彭真，周保中，呂正操，凱豐，大家算了一算，準備來答覆這個問題。開始大家頗爲直截了當，說，除開國軍所在地區外，全是共軍掌握的地區。但是李普曼堅持到底，一定要問幾分之幾。</p>
<p>「啊呀，這就難算了，從沒統計過。」彭真說：「可以這樣說，南至營口，東至撫順，西迄山海關，北至四平街以南，都是國軍地區，以人口來說，我們區域佔百分之七十，以面積來說，則爲百分之八十五。」</p>
<p>「這樣好了，以蒙古除外。」周保中補充說：面積也佔百分之七十，兩個百分之七十。</p>
<p>但是問到齊齊哈爾以北的情形，他們則說不清楚，共軍還沒有去接收。</p>
<p>慎之提到關於東北工業建設的問題，問彭真中共東北局方面的研究結果如何。他回答說：</p>
<p>「研究的結果認爲如果沒有阻碍，三年就可以完全恢復原態。」</p>
<p>艾伯娜問：「是不是打算美國的援助？」</p>
<p>「這要由美國目標。」彭回答。</p>
<p>慎之又問：「那麼，這三年恢復是根據什麼條件得來的結論呢？」</p>
<p>「根據政治條件，只要民主和平，三年不成問題。」</p>
<p>因此，慎之雙問是不是有專家研究這問題。彭真說：「我們那裏幾個秘書研究這問題。」</p>
<p>「不過，工業的破壞很少，」彭真繼續說：我到撫順看過，僅損失十分之二三。蘇聯拆運的工業設備，僅限於軍事工業。</p>
<p>我們同中共人員接觸時，他們對這個問題都不願多作任何理論上的說明，只說這是一個　爭論的問題。爭論限於理論，但我們從未爭論過，而事實是無可爭論的，我們中間，有幾人都先後到撫順去看過，因此慎之就對彭真說</p>
<p>「我也看過撫順，例如撫順的火力發電廠是一個動力部份，自然，軍事工業也需要動力，但拆去啓羅量達十分之九。其他煉油廠，液化廠，電氣鍋的損失都有巨大數字。我們現在即來作理論上的爭論，也無補於事」。彭真默然。（未完）</p>

<h3>流亡羣的呼聲（一）</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我們知道貴報是一向主持正義的，能爲民眾講幾句話的，所以我們從胃眯的寫了一篇稿子，想請一先生能馬上在貴報上登載起來，藉比得到社會的同情，給我們一個相當的援助，我們是太可憐而可慘了！復旦大學流浪人工敬啓。</p>
<p>我是蘇北東南角—啓海—某一鄉村的人，也可以說在這一大堆流亡青年羣中的一員。我是有自己的家鄉，自己的田園，也有白髮的爹娘，唱隨的妻子，繞膝的兒女，可親可愛的一切的一切。然而然而（我要用一百個然而）現在呢？自己的家已被一批「共他人之產爲自己之產」的「民主」「信徒」所佔據瓜分了！鄉呢？已「變了色」了，已在另一個「皇權」的統率之下了！田呢？被人强佔了！園呢？荒蕪了！爸呢？終日地提心吊胆的　着氣！娘呢？時時刻刻的哭泣着！妻子呢？遭遇着和我相同的命運被拘禁着，威迫着，恐嚇着！兒女呢？寄養，帮傭的帮傭！可愛的可親的一切的一切呢？已完結了，毀減了！我沒有犯過什麼法，我沒有當過漢奸，但是我不知道爲何要受到如此殘酷，淒慘。野蠻，卑鄙……的處罰？難道我們前世作了什麼孽嗎？然而這是「唯心」的，現在應該要講「唯物」的，這個答案似乎有些不正確。有人告訴我說：你本人沒有犯什麼法，你的財產犯了法。但是我又想，我的財產是根據了法律所付予我的應享的權利，這種權利不衹我一個人所有，並且，我也沒有用巧取豪奪欺淩詐取的方法得來的，是我用了我的勞力後應得的報酬，那我的這個答案又有些疑問。另外又有人告訴我說：「爲的你不是一個新民主主義「聖經」的信徒，否則的話，你決不流亡，決不爲被掠了你的一切。不但不會流亡，被掠，並且還可以共一些「他人之產爲」你「自己之產」哩。這個答案，我有些似懂非懂，因爲我沒有研究過俄國革命史，所以我不清楚這個道理，不過我想我又不是一個紅眉毛綠眼睛的洋大人，爲什麼有人硬勁要拿洋貨搬到咱們中國來使我們這般無辜的青年們受苦呢？可是我爲什麼要受這種罪，我始終還是莫名其妙。</p>
<p>雖然，這是我個人的遭遇，用不到大聲疾呼，徒費唇舌。不過我相信，像我同樣遭遇的人決不止一個，並且有若干相當大的數目哩。不信請你看看在這裏就是一大羣，要向先生請求向政府當局控訴，向金中國有人道理智的同胞們作如下的呼籲：</p>
<p>抗戰是勝利了，敵人是趕走了，在中國每一個角落的人們是清楚這一件事的，就是附和敵人的漢奸們當然也不能否認的。在抗戰勝利後的今天，是不是我們需要自己殺自己，今天打這城，明天打那城，害得老百姓受了八年戰禍還不够，應該再受到更殘忍的屠殺？這一批混世魔王般的窮兵　的流氓們，還說「取得真理，必須鬥爭」將中國的天下拱手交付給你，就是「真理」了吧！滿足了你殺人的人慾望，就是「真理」了吧！現在讓我先來講一些蘇北東南角—啓海—的情形，然後再來講我的請求控訴呼籲吧：</p>
<p>（一）擁兵割据—抗戰期間，中國是分了三個天下。現在勝利了，鬼子是垮台了，附和的羣醜們也跟之鳥散了，剩下的還有兩個天下。一個是所謂「收復區」，一個是所謂「解放區」。在「收復區」和別的「解放區」的情形，我都不清楚。我所知道的「東南地區」的情形是這樣。敵人雖逃跑了，但是好像還在大戰的前夕，青年壯丁要入伍，由最苦幹的民兵，而逐漸升到區隊。團隊，而主力兵，一味與中央相抗，各自爲政。</p>
<p>（二）對鎖物資—抗戰期間，爲了減減敵人的給養，對於物資的封鎖，這是一百萬分的應該。但是現在呢，戰事已結束的了，全面勝利了，但是我們的「東南地區」還是不下於和敵人相抗時的戰時狀態。凡是未得當地「政府」的允准。所有食糧棉花及其他一切的土產槪不許出口，這抗的的話，罰款充公，「提將官裏去」，那個花頭難多哩。弄得所有的大小商人莫不呌苦連天，—不，這句話不妥當，應該說弄得所有的大小商人莫不「額手稱慶」，慶祝咱們是勝利了，「解放」了，「民主」了！</p>
<p>（三）麻醉青年—不問你是中學生，小學生或是現在是學生，過去是學生，總之，只要你是有一些智識的，或者準備要有一些智識的，你就有「資格」「權利」被强迫讀「新華日報」「江海導報」「新人生觀」等等報章書本，非等到你的腦子是確實已經染得紅至發出黑來不止。假使你這個人確實是頑而不靈固而不化，那麼保險你一定載一只最時髦的大禮帽呌做「反動」，那你就危險了，隨時隨進有民兵大老爺在監視，而且也隨時隨地有被拘被殺的可能。</p>
<p>（四）强索公糧—納稅是人民的義務，但是「諸親好友應不賒欠」的，欠了怎麼樣，準備吃麻　。租是減了，減了二五，還要打折扣，表示「大廉價」什麼折扣，不等，六折七折的有，四折五折的也有，所以弄得一般中產，以上的人有苦說不出，你說了苦，你就是「反動」，「瞧不起政府」。</p>
<p>（五）勒用共黨—在咱們的「解放區」，中央票是不准用的，據說這是「反動」的鈔票，解放區是應該用「民主」的鈔票的。用了如何？客氣一點是沒收，但是不銷燬，銷燬了倒底是錢，可惜的；不准用的是老百姓，商人，民兵官長却不在此限。爲何？道理就是咱們大中華民國的大國民一向是「只許州官放火，不許百姓點燈」的。別忘了這句話！那麼用什麼票子才不犯法呢？名目繁多，不識字的老鄉真有些弄不清楚，有「東南地區」的地方票，有「江淮銀行票」，有「浙東銀行票」，有「華中銀行票」，可惜咱們老百姓沒有槍檊子，沒有軋鈔票的機器，不然倒也是生財有道了！</p>
<p>（六）任意派捐—你坐在家裏，不常會有民兵大老爺，農抗會，歸抗會的「主任」，「同志」到你家裏來，向你勒募，錢也要，食糧也要，衣服，褲子，鞋子，帳子，被單，什麼都好，尤其是碰到季節的時候，那簡要忙得不得了，要應付他們。有的時候說是慰勞「地方官長」，有的時候說是慰勞「前方將士」。更有那個稅所，那真弊端百出，有的收了錢不開票，有的貨多報少，送些香烟錢，大家措揩油，大家說不出口。</p>
<p>（七）强奸民意—旣然高唱「民主」，不得不做一些「民主」的式樣起來。有了犯人要開公審大會，晚上要開小組討論會，算是懲求民意，但是主張還是幾個少數統治階級的主腦早已內定好的。你要反對可以嗎？當然可以，不反對是不「民主」，但是以後請你當心，你已被當權者所注目了。或者在會前，預先有「民主」「同志」們埋伏好了，一通而過，大槪他們是深知道「羣眾是盲目」的心理的。</p>
<p>（八）蹂躪人權—專制是反時代的，因此民主是迎合時代的。但是我們民眾所要求的民主不問它是「新」的還是「舊」的，而要的是真的，不是假的。如果徒有民主之美名，而行更甚於專制的實際，這種民主，我們老百姓簡直見得有些可恨，可佈，可憐而可惡。在我們蘇北的東南角，一般地聽到的是民主的聲浪，而遭遇到的是專制的現實。人民固談不到信仰，居住，言論出版的自由，連生命財產的保障都沒有。只要你不同民主的信徒來往敷衍，你到處就有人監視或被暗殺，你的財產也隨時要被人瓜分侵佔。像這樣提羊頭賣狗肉的民主，十二萬分的令人失望。</p>
<p>總之，在蘇北的東南角—啓海，百分之九十九點五的人民，莫不是啞子吃黃連，有苦說不出。只有這餘下的點五的同志們是明吭高歌，大彈其生財有道的凱旋之歌哩。</p>
<p>倘就最近的情形來說呢，使人傷心。商人吧，旣受了物資封鎖的影響，土產不得運出，外貨不得運進，鈔票不能流通，現在更要據納營業稅，並受公營商店，合作社的統制，不能自由交易。農人吧，除了民兵外，同樣地要繳公糧，佔不至實惠，一片「出頭」「升天」的日子的希望和熱誠也冰冷了。工人吧，要受工頭的監督，用自己力氣換來的工資，要抽去十分之一的佣金給工頭，假使不去拍工頭的馬屁，也就派不到工作。士人吧，最苦了，恨的真爺老子，當時爲什麼化了錢叫噌們讀書，害得現在給人家拖着尾巴不放手，一些動不得，爲了識得幾個斗大的字而致枉死的，不知凡幾。</p>
<p>以上是一個非常節略的報告。現在我要說到我的開頭的三點了：</p>
<p>（一）對先生的一個請求—我們知道先生是民眾的喉舌，希望你能協助我們這一羣流亡的青年，向政府建議一個好的辦法來，安置我們，向社會賢達設法拯救我們。我們已是一羣無家可歸的可憐人了！已是在東闖西邊的一羣無歸宿的人了！我們道三十多個人眼看要餓死了！先生呀，救救我們吧！</p>
<p>（二）對政府的一個控訴—中央有計方的官長們：你們是高高在上，你們還知道民間的疾苦嗎？你們還知道一大批一大批的青年出鄉村而流亡到都市來嗎？我想你們一定會聽到這件事的。但是你們爲何始終默不作聲，而沒有一個適當年辦法來保護安排我們呢？你們每天忙的是什麼事？老百姓的痛苦不解除，一味的裝聾作啞，這在良心上有些慚愧嗎？我們這三十多個人，均是由各個村荘上先後的爲了不堪「民主」的壓迫，而逃亡到縣市區的無意地集合起來的，但是現在縣市又失守了，被共軍所佔據了，我們又不得不逃亡到江南了。我們已是回不得家鄉，見不得爺娘的人羣了！屋子一間間高的矮的都有，吃的東西好的歹的都有，但是這些都是人家的，我們不能隨便的去「共」他們。我們在匆忙間奔逃時所携帶的區區的幾個錢，眼看不氣死也要餓死了！政府的大員們，救救我們吧！希望你們真真地做起一個「官」「長」來，挺起胸來，扛起肩來，負起責任來，不要辜負了國家付託你們的重任，民眾殷切的期望！</p>
<p>（三）對社會的一個呼籲—父老兄弟諸姑姊妹們：現在你們正在過着舒適優閑的安居樂業的生活，但是你們有沒有聽到過同你們一樣的黃帝的子孫而所過着的另一個世界的生活，截然不同的生活？我們眼看食不足飽衣不蔽體了！爲的什麼？爲了我們是正過着逃亡的生活！爲了什麼我們要逃亡呢？請問你們懂得什麼叫做「三資運動」嗎？所謂三資就是「資產」「智識」「資望」。這三種人就是「解放區」的筱壓迫的三種人，現在在「新民主」主義領導下的政府向這三種人開刀了！所以這三種人紛紛地爭先恐後的逃亡了。刀子放在脖子上到底是可怕的呀！我們是逃亡了，但是我閃如何度日下去呢？親愛的同胞們呀！你們不要以爲你們現在是安居樂業了，我想信或許有一天這一把刀子也要放到你們警惕覺悟，很希望你們給我們響應和救濟。</p>
<p>末了，我閃對於所有流亡的青年們有一個意見：我們都是人間的不幸者，我們滿望着勝利後的今天我們還要過着更甚於敵僞壓境時的逃亡的生活。我們也想不到在二十世紀的今天，秦始皇焚書坑孺的野蠻專制的政情重現於文明的世界！我們也想不到敎會我們歌唱流亡三部曲的「抗敵者」，翻起臉來叫我們流亡了！我們想前想後，這樣的散漫的逃亡，我們要一輩子苦下去，一輩子回不得家鄉。我們要「打回老家去」！我們須得聯合起來，組織起來，然後向政府請求給我們保護安置，向社會請求給我們救濟，扶助，這樣我們才會生力量。（流亡者上）</p>

<h3>論社會組織（上）</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>社會是由人民組織起來的，但是社會並不衹是人民的聯合或總和。此地我們所謂社會是廣義的，它是指任何由個人所組織的團體，如文藝研究會，足球隊，青年會，紅十字會，政黨，政府等等。本文所要說明的就是像這類的社會團體乃是個人間的一種有　性的組織，而並不是許多的個人機械的拚合起來的總和。</p>
<p>個人與社會的關係，這是社會學上一種爭論未決的問題。有人主張社會衹是一個空名義，衹有個人是實在的，社會除了個人之外是一無所有的。又有人主張衹有社會是實在的，個人離開了社會便不能存在，社會中的個人等於全體中的部分。其實，這兩種說法都有一部分是對的，但都不是全對的。我們一方面主張個人是社會的必需條件，另一方面主張社會是超個人的實體。我們說，個人是社會的必需條件，這就是說，假使沒有個人，那末便沒有社會；但是徒有許多的個人也不成其爲社會。假定在同一間房間裏面有許多的人，有的在讀書，有的在看報，有的在談話，有的在拍球，這許多「各行其是」的個人聯合在一起並不等於是一個團體。我們說，社會是超個人的實體，這就是說，社會雖是由個人所組織成功的，但是社會超乎個人之上。自有它存在的特性，而不等於許多個性的總和。例如水是H2和O所組織成功的，但是水的特性並不等於H2的特性和O的特性。再如一所房屋是由許多不板磚瓦泥灰所建築起來的。但是我們不能說：「房屋者乃若干木瓦泥灰之總和也。」房屋之所以爲房屋乃是因爲它超過它的組織因素之上而自有其特點</p>
<p>現在我們進一步請問社會所有超個人的特性是甚麼呢？簡單的回答說，社會之所以成爲就是因爲在許多的個人之間衹有一個目標，衹有一個組織系統，衹有一個領導機構。在一個社會組織裏面衹能有一個爲許多個人共同所具有的總目標。一個文藝研究會所以可能成立乃是由於許多個人都想共同的來研究文藝。假使在同一個塲所中有人有朗誦詩歌，有人在宣傳政治主張，有人在談戀愛，我們便不能說這是一個文藝研究會。在同一個社會組織之下個人在自己的意志之上還有一個超個人意志的普遍意志。普遍意志旣不是一種神秘的力量，也不是許多個人意志之總和。所謂個人意志之總和即是把張三想研究文藝，李四想宣傳政治主張，趙先生想和錢女士變戀愛的個別意志加起來。普遍意志是各個人共同所有的意志，張三想研究文藝，李四·趙大·錢二都想研究文藝，這便形成了普遍意志。這種普遍意志並不是他們中任何一人所特有的，而是他們間所公有的。所以它雖不是脫離個人的，而却是超越個人的。</p>
<p>社會旣是建築在同一個目標之上的，那末它衹能有一個組織系統。所謂組織系統就是執行工作以達到目標的工具，這種工具的效能就是能够運用最靈活而經濟的方式去充分的實現目標。這種組織衹能屬於一個體系的。假使有兩個不同的目標，那末難免有兩個不同的行政組織系統。可是在同一個目標之下，若是同時有兩個不同的組織系統。結果不是破壞了這個共同的目標，便是減低了達到這個目標的效能。</p>
<p>社會的領導者乃是一個或幾個先知先覺者，他們看清楚了這個共同目標，把握住羣眾的力量，推動着一個最有效能的行政機構以求圓滿的達到這個目標。他是一個組織者，推動者，同時是一個滿足大眾的需要者。領袖是群眾的代表。他代表群眾來表現他們的願望；他代表群眾去爭取他們的目標。社會衹有一個目標，所以也衹能有一個領導者。一個領導者並不是指一個人的獨裁。一個領導者是指一個混然一體的少數先知先覺的集團核心負着領導群眾的責任。假使有兩個領導的機構，那末彼此之間便容易發生了衝突，結果非但群眾沒有得到益處，反百莫之所措，無所趨從，甚至於被利用得生命塗炭，民不聊生。（未完）</p>
<h3>上海美協勝利展略評</h3>
<p>— 竹厂</p>
<p>上海美術協會成立之後，爲慶祝勝利即着手籌備第一屆展覽會，籌備匝月，已於五月卅一日至六月六日，假寗波同鄉會爲東會塲，中國畫苑爲西會塲同時舉行。出品計書法，國畫，西畫，　　篆刻，攝影等六七百件，參加作家至二百五十餘人之多，集中西美術於一堂，蔚成洋洋大觀，爲抗戰以來上海美術界未有之盛舉。故連日前往參觀者至爲擁擠。</p>
<p>攝影方面出品不多，仍以郎靜山之黃山雲霧最爲出色。敖思洪所攝亦別具精思。篆刻出呂尤少，陶壽伯勁健古雅，方介堪平正純厚，自屬其中翹楚，彫塑出品旣少，似列醒目之作，此道尚待勢力。恐係社會環境使然，一時發展殊不易易。西畫大槪分油畫，水彩兩種。油畫方面，以張充仁之醫院大幅，最惹人注目。色彩秀麗，人體正確，在近代西畫界，已歸難得之作，惟全幅構圖缺乏統一稍嫌散漫，而青情方面，亦覺過於平淡，無緊張之氣氛。冉熙之水彩，善寫朝霧晚霞，用筆雄厚，而日光水色融合無痕，於極簡單之筆劃中，能表現極複雜之物象，應推水彩中之傑作。西畫陳列於中國畫苑，其畫架之方向本適於中國畫，與西畫不甚合適，故光綫方面，皆係從側面而入，非耀眼不能逼視，即黑暗不能見物。陣列者似應注意配光，不能只圖省力也。畫法方面，未見冀翁出馬，殊少力作，未免減色。王福厂淳正有餘，氣魄不足；馬公愚長於秀逸，抽於奔放，惟馮文風筆力雄健，可謂壓倒鎮眉。</p>
<p>國畫方面出品最多，係會中之主幹，其中不乏傑作，惜不能一一列舉。惟就觀覽所及，將其印象最深者，略述一斑。近年畫魚之風頗盛，王師子以光彩勝；劉獅以美麗勝；汪亞塵以　　勝；皆能獨樹一幟，爭長魚國。畫獅虎者亦有數人，張善子故後未見　響，熊松泉老而彌健，不得不推此道祭酒。在花鳥方面，似少動人之作，人物亦少可觀。惟士女不乏作者，如吳青霞周鍊霞均工細艷麗，殊無骨氣。李秋君著墨不多，反饒古雅之趣。山水方面，爲國畫之壓卷。張碧寒仿黃　山樵，神韻宛肖，而靜穆之氣直臻爐火純青。吳振平仿元人寓離橫於規矩之中，氣息純古，可與碧寒並駕，仿古之作當以二人爲最上乘。俞劍吳足跡半天下，所至名山大川，盡收畫藝，於抗戰期間又縱遊東南各名勝，近始歸滬，不久舉行名山寫生個展。此次出品四幅，均工整秀逸，一雙本來面目，而其雄健勁拔之氣自不可掩。所謂百鍊鋼化爲饒指柔者非耶。鄭午昌秋山一幅，參以石濤梅瞿山斐半千諸家法純用焦墨重色，允推傑作。至其蘆葦楊柳兩幅，則殊嫌單薄，無渾厚蒼潤之趣，與秋山一幅相較，去之遠矣。暫天健青綠大幅鮮艷奪目，爲慶祝勝利遠都而作，應時應景，具有歷史意義。賀氏畢生如此傑作恐亦不能多得。馮超然水墨一幅筆墨散漫，毫無神氣，年老力衰聞已不能作畫，吳待秋青綠一幅雖無平日重瀉之病，但又未免空疏，此外應　　吳仲熊被辛臺顧坤伯等，平日所作均極高妙此次所列似非精意之作，不免使觀者失望，會中幼稚不成熟之作品尚多，審查方面實覺太冤。此點望於第二屆展覽時有所改進。</p>
<h3>殘春　（小說）</h3>
<p>— 中羣</p>
<p>「別吃醋！我是可憐他，不是愛他，你放心！」緊倚到他胸前，她嫣然一笑。</p>
<p>一封幸福的白衣人兒在走廊裏低聲談笑，劍光在床上聽得很清楚，「不是愛，是可憐！」他悽然嘆了一聲，伸手到床頭去　　電鈴，茶房來了，他吩咐茶房將茶几上那盆小紅花搬出去，茶房希奇地問：</p>
<p>「昨天才買來，又開了這麼一朶好看的花，爲什麼要搬出去呢？」　　「我不歡喜這紅的顏色，我怕看見紅！」</p>
<p>茶房奇怪得笑起來：「那麼叫我搬到那裏去呢？」</p>
<p>「隨便吧，丟了也好，送人也好，你自己拿去也好，總之，我不要牠了！」</p>
<p>去送給隔壁一個女病人好嗎？茶房問。</p>
<p>「好的，我早說隨便你：」</p>
<p>茶房端着花盆出去時，那朶紅色的小花又在劍光眼前晃了畁，他這才看清楚，那是一朶紅色的薔薇，細小的，可是很美麗。</p>
<p>濛濛細雨飄洒在玻窗上，的瀝答拉。……</p>
<p>秀珍被一陣輕微的雨聲吵醒了。</p>
<p>翻一個身，摸了摸汗黏黏的胸口，她感到渾身有一股冷意：冷的汗，冷的手，冷的脚，冷的身體，冷的被窩。</p>
<p>而她的心也憂地冷下來了！</p>
<p>寂寂的病房，寂寂的雨聲，床上的被單是白，茶几上的　毯是白，窗上的帘子是白，……到處是一片白，死了人的白，一些沒有點破這死沈沈白色的其他顏色，尤其是紅。</p>
<p>她知道又做了一個夢，空虛的夢，飄渺的夢，然而太可愛了！好要抓住牠！</p>
<p>抓住牠！她回味着夢境！</p>
<p>夢境中，是春天！不是細雨濛濛的春天，是陽不我輝煌的春天</p>
<p>她站在河邊，河邊開滿鮮花，水是綠的顏色，花是紅的顏色，紅綠相映中，她看見一隻白色的小帆，在河中來回蕩漾。</p>
<p>一陣歌聲傳來了，小帆上有人在唱歌：</p>
<p>「美麗的姨娘啊！</p>
<p>你的眼睛如珍珠，</p>
<p>你的嘴唇如寶石，，</p>
<p>你的細細的腰身，</p>
<p>如一根柔軟無比的緞帶，</p>
<p>我要求永永遠遠將你緊在我心上！</p>
<p>……」</p>
<p>好熟悉的聲音！是誰在唱呀</p>
<p>歌聲近了，小帆近了，她看清楚了：竟是他！</p>
<p>他！———</p>
<p>潔白的衣服，潔白的方臉，年青的，英俊的，像一朶高貴端荘的百合花，靜立於小帆中央，在向她微笑。</p>
<p>她的心狂跳，她的臉發燒，胆怯地，低低地，她呌了一聲：「何醫生！」</p>
<p>何醫生對她招招手。</p>
<p>「做什麼呢？」她害羞地問</p>
<p>「你來！你是我的，我愛你！」何醫生低低的說。</p>
<p>她羞得渾身發燒，然而一陣風過，她已在何醫生的小帆裏了</p>
<p>小帆很狹窄，他緊緊地靠着好怕身體，像一團火，她覺得自已漸漸融化了，融化了融化得分小出那裏是自己，那裏是他。……</p>
<p>小帆蕩開去，到處是紅花，綠木，青天，陽光，……芬芳的，熱烈的，……她和他的春天，……她太快樂，她忘形地笑着，然而她醒來了！</p>
<p>醒來了，什麼都沒有了！只有一間死寂的病房，只有一片死了人的白。……</p>
<p>「抓住牠！抓住牠！」秀珍還要想回味，還要想抓住那夢境，可是一陣劇烈的「咳咳咳咳……」，她的臉也喘成灰白，冷汗，直淋下來。……</p>
<p>肺病，—一支冰箭穿過她脆弱的心！</p>
<p>紅花，綠水，青天，陽光，……芬芳的春天，快樂的春天，……消失了！被一陣劇烈的喘咳衝減了！</p>
<p>然而她仍想掙扎！她伸手到床頭去摸電鈴，她想喊茶房來，吩咐他：「我咳得真厲害，你快去給我請何醫生來！」</p>
<p>但她的手驀地縮住了，她聽到外面走廊裏有一陣輕微的脚聲，先是沉重的，有規律的，樹膠底皮鞋聲音，接着是徐緩的，遲疑的，用脚尖走路的高跟皮鞋聲音。兩種脚聲在一個地點停下後，低快的笑聲響起來：</p>
<p>「Darling　Darling！怎麼你還要去看那傢伙？」</p>
<p>「別吃醋！我是可憐他，不是愛他，你放心！」</p>
<p>「那麼我也要請你別吃醋！」</p>
<p>「什麼？……」</p>
<p>「裝什麼假！不是你常在提防那個美麗的女病人嗎？對你說了吧，好怕肺病一天厲害一天，即使是天女下凡，我也不敢去近她的！你儘管放一百二十個心吧！」</p>
<p>談話沒有談完，笑聲沒有完。但秀珍再也聽不下去了！</p>
<p>按住作痛的心口，冰冷的汗珠和冰冷的淚水同時滴到枕頭上</p>
<p>「春天是他們的！春天與我無份了！」沉痛地，絕望地，她低泣着。她不願看見那一片死了人的白，她閉上眼睛，抽咽得渾身顫抖。</p>
<p>她哭得太傷心。有人輕輕旋開她的房門，她不知道。有人走近她床前，她不知道。直到有人低喚着「王小姐」，她才張開眼睛。</p>
<p>張開眼睛，她奇怪得幾乎呌起來。一朶細小的，鮮紅的薔薇花出現在她眼前！一個年老的茶房張開大嘴在向她微笑。、</p>
<p>「是怎麼一會事？」抹抹眼角的淚珠，她奇怪地問。</p>
<p>「王小姐！你爲什麼傷心？看！隔壁沈先生給你送這麼一盆好看的花來了！」</p>
<p>「隔壁沈先生？」她的心開始有些跳動。</p>
<p>「是的，沈先生和你生着一樣的病。又和你一樣，常常傷心。剛才他呌我把這盆花搬出來時，臉孔上也掛滿淚水。……」</p>
<p>茶房叨叨地說，秀珍却陷在沈思中了。她忽然問：「沈先生有多少年紀？漂亮嗎？」</p>
<p>「沈先生年紀輕得很，至多廿五歲。真漂亮哩！就可惜生了病！」</p>
<p>茶房出去了。秀珍盯住那朶紅花看。她疑心自己又在做着夢，拚命把眼睜大來，睜大來。……</p>
<p>不是夢！的的確確，她的死寂的房間裏有了一朶鮮艷的紅花了！</p>
<p>漸漸地，淚水又從她眼角流下來。然而這不是絕望和痛苦的淚水，乃是快樂和覺悟的淚水。</p>
<p>服地藥，吃過牛奶，她盡力撐起身體，從床邊一張小桌子的抽屈裏，取出一本印着蜜黃色細花紋的信紙，她伏枕在上寫了這麼幾句：</p>
<p>「沈先生：</p>
<p>謝謝你送給我這朶紅色的薔薇！牠太美麗了！牠帶來了我失去的春天，賜給了我新的生命！不過我還沒有知道你的名字，你能告訴我嗎？　王秀珍。」</p>
<p>她用興奮顫抖的手指摺起那張信紙，交給茶房送到隔壁後，用興奮顫抖的心情期待着回音。</p>
<p>回音果然就來了。是一隻淡藍色的洋信封，裏面放一張淡藍色信箋，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「秀珍小姐：</p>
<p>你謝謝我，我却要謝謝上帝！不要笑我，我在吻着你的信箋。因爲你信箋上那些蜜黃色的小花正是我所要想找的。」我的春天回來了，我的生命也回來了！現在我告訴你，我的名字呌劍光，願你不要忘記……</p>
<p>過了一年</p>
<p>依然是快樂的春天，年青人的春天。</p>
<p>芬芳的，熱烈的，到處是光，到處是香，到處是甜蜜的歌聲和婚禮進行曲的飛揚。……</p>
<p>美麗的李鶯小姐和英俊的何醫生結婚了！</p>
<p>大旅館的禮堂上。新娘穿着銀色的禮服，新郎佩着緋色的康乃馨，在鮮花叢中携着手，驕傲地笑，神秘地笑，忘懷了一切地笑！……然而，———</p>
<p>同樣的春天，郊外一塊寂寞的荒地上，多起了二個白石的新墳。一個墳前有一個棵紅色的薔薇，一個墳前有一棵蜜黃色的美人蕉。雖沒有人欣賞，却也在寂寂地開着花。</p>

<h3>簡</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>遙遠的聽你的消息，心裏老宕着一份躁急，一份担憂。脆弱的神經，儘幻夢着些不祥的預兆，我好像聽見誰在　着生命，誰在猙獰地狂笑。</p>
<p>我希望生活在敵人的國，充滿了戰鬥，充滿了活力，又怎願像深山裏修道士般過寂靜的生活？但是，那些笨拙的卑劣的劍術，我幾乎已經懶得再去回手，我永不願這些卑劣者做我的友人，但是，這些人似乎做我的敵人也遠欠缺一些，欠缺一些人生的至寶——正直和　正。</p>
<p>我愛生活，我恨生活。正如你所說，「做人是難的」，我要補充一點意思，做一個浮浮沉沉的人是容易的，要做一個自己控制自己的人是很難的。</p>
<p>要走上一條康荘大道，遠較走一條羊腸曲徑艱難。我不怕嘲笑，我不怕寂寞，路是那麼長，我害怕總會停止我的步伐。我要疲倦地休息了。</p>
<p>你要笑我？罵我？反正，隨你吧，這些滋味，你大槪也都知道。記得，從前，有人在說：「他們要那樣，」我們立刻就回答：「我們一定要這樣。」告訴我，現在是不是還是那麼堅定？希望你還是那麼年青，高聲回答：「是的。」</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>墨太太走後第二天，寶鈴就撥到藥材店去了。爲了要表示他是有志氣的男兒，雖然墨盛告訴他墨太太給他留了後步，房子並沒有賣，勸他暫且不要離開家，等房子出租以後再講，但他堅持不肯。他對於墨太太這種用心是感激的，可是這感激抵價不了他的惆悵，他決心從此自立生活。他想，如今才是他真正開始走路的時候，儘管路如何的坎坷不平，這第一步，他一定要走得　，走得正！他不怕摔交，摔下去，他還要爬起來再走，總之，他抱定宗旨要不畏艱險，不避困難地走下去，走到老，走到死，他都不預備休息，也不欲人來扶持！</p>
<p>這家藥材店字號叫回春堂。老板廖大富是四川人，路過醫道。早年專門在川滇一帶採辦藥材到湖北各地推銷，漸漸賺了些錢，就在荊州開了一爿藥材店。運氣不壞，十幾年光景，由一間門面如今已經擴充或三大問題門面了。藥材齊全，貨色真實道地，在荊州算得是一家首屈一指的藥材店。廖老闆自從六年前又一次往四川採辦藥材，到了家鄉適逢髪妻病故，於是帶了六歲的兒子離開家鄉，便再不曾回去過。爲了兒子需要人撫養，就在荊州續了茲，討的是一位屠夫的女兒，也許是平時看見宰殺的行爲太多了，這位屠夫的女兒，把流血當作和撒尿一樣平常！性情不免受了劊子手的影響，似乎殘酷就是本能！一臉的橫肉，肥得自己就像一頭豬，一頭待宰的豬！廖老闆倒是一個善良人，恰相反，他也許是經營藥材太久。把救人當作和自己吃飯一樣重要！加之受了一點醫道的影響，仁慈就是他的天性！雖然，他擁有大批的藥材，又兼能醫道；而他竟瘦得像一個病夫，一個長年與藥廠爲伴的病夫！其實哩，他比誰都健壯！四十多歲的人哪，一天跑上個百幾十里路滿不在乎。</p>
<p>老闆娘嫁給廖老闆以後，第二年便生了個胖小子。如今也有五足歲了，廖老闆替大兒子取名廖棟，二兒子取名廖樑，意思是：他的這雙兒子，就是他這個家有棟梁。</p>
<p>廖棟已經十二個年頭了，總算徵倖，沒有在屠婦型的繼母手裏被宰掉，雖然皮肉上免不了受些苦頭，究竟不曾到流血的地步。脊梁上偶然留下幾條紫色的鞭痕。廖老闆有的是道地雲南「白藥」，只消敷上一瓶，也就能夠止痛消腫了。廖老闆爲了減少他們母子摩擦的機會，便把廖棟送到學堂去念書。如今廖棟初級小學已經畢業了。按着老闆娘的意思，就不讓她再繼續下去了，一則念書花錢，二則留在店裏記記賬。適巧前幾天記賬員走了，這樣就可以省掉一個記同的開銷。但廖老闆不同意，廖老闆決定把廖棟培植到中學畢業，然後便呌他接替自己管理店務，目前就呌他記賬，似乎還太早了些。於是廖棟又得繼續念書，廖老闆使雇了寶鈴來充記賬員。老闆娘雖然心裏不高興，可也沒辦法。</p>

<h3>Marshall's Letter to Mao Zedong: Hope for Sincerity from Yan'an; Zhou Enlai and Others Return to Yan'an to Confer on the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] After the announcement of the fifteen-day ceasefire communique was issued separately by the Chairman of the National Government and the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), people in Nanjing, regarding the CCP's statement, specifically the two phrases, "and negotiations will inevitably involve political issues related to the Northeast and even the whole country, requiring more time," although not without a feeling of procrastination, but those who have a historical understanding of the CCP's consistent style, all believe this to be a political tactic of the CCP. Before going to Yan'an, Zhou Enlai, in order to prevent encountering obstacles in Yan'an, might as well drag a tail so as to shirk responsibility. However, the CCP headquarters in Yan'an, being the CCP's highest decision-making body, should not hold such a view or make such statements if it has a sincere intention for a ceasefire and peace, as this would be playing tricks and losing credibility in the world. Now Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi took a special plane by way of Marshall's plane at ten o'clock this morning directly to Yan'an to ask for instructions. Before his departure, Zhou had two meetings with Marshall yesterday to conduct decisive discussions on the Northeast issue and the restoration of transportation. It is said that Marshall had a handwritten letter entrusted to Zhou to be delivered to Mao Zedong. The content is unknown. Many believe that Marshall has placed his most sacred enthusiasm and last hope on Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] It is reported that Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi flew to Yan'an at about 5:00 PM today. The CCP headquarters has scheduled an important meeting for the 8th to hear Zhou and Lu's report on the ceasefire negotiations and discuss countermeasures. Based on past actions by the CCP headquarters, a major plan can be decided within a maximum of two days. It is said that Zhou and Lu told people before their departure that they would stay in Yan'an for three or four days, and at the latest, they can be expected to return to Nanjing before the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] Premier Song Ziwen visited Marshal Marshall again on the morning of the 7th to discuss the new situation after the issuance of the ceasefire order. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General, expressed to visiting reporters: They are sincerely optimistic. Lei also said: The Three-Person Committee will definitely convene within this half-month to discuss detailed measures for implementing the PCC resolutions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] The fifteen-day ceasefire order has taken effect today. The focus of general attention has shifted to the PCC small group and the Military Three-Person Committee, which symbolize peace negotiations, and when they will resume their meetings. According to reliable sources, the Military Three-Person Committee will reconvene as soon as Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing from Yan'an. However, the previous government representative, Xu Yongchang, was originally a temporary appointment. This time, Chen Cheng will personally attend. As for the resumption of the PCC small group, it must wait until the Military Three-Person Committee reaches an initial agreement and resolves the major premise before it can continue to be held.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] PCC representatives Mo Dehui, Li Huang, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, and Shen Junru gathered at 3:00 PM on the 7th to exchange information and discuss military and political issues. No concrete conclusions were reached. They decided to continue discussions on the afternoon of the 8th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen said: During the fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast, it feels like too short a time to solve all kinds of problems that have accumulated over the years, but if both sides have sincerity, the overall situation can be determined within days. The Comprehensive Group will not continue to meet until the Military Three-Person Committee establishes a preliminary agreement. I am extremely optimistic about Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order in the Northeast. This time, the Communist Party will not withdraw from the negotiations. The Constitution Drafting Committee will also not hold formal meetings until military and political issues are resolved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall hinted that Zhou Enlai may be carrying an outline of a national permanent cessation of conflict plan. This great plan must be approved by the CCP Politburo before Zhou Enlai, in his capacity as the CCP representative on the Military Three-Person Committee, signs an agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 6th Dispatch] Today, the Communist Party openly issued a warning, saying that General Marshall's efforts will ultimately be "ineffective" unless American troops immediately withdraw from China. The fifteen-day ceasefire between the KMT and the CCP is therefore shaken again.</p>

He has now received confirmation that the orders have been followed, and troops are stopping at their current locations. During these fifteen days of the ceasefire, the National Army will not, under no circumstances, take any military action beyond this boundary if not attacked, hoping that the CCP can also strictly abide by the ceasefire order and not infiltrate the rear of the National Army, causing disputes.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] The Conference on the Implementation of the Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System held full-day review sessions in three groups today.

The third group reviewed the budget, with a total of 43 cases, convened by Shen Honglie, Hu Shanheng, and Chen Qingyu. All members of the review committees attended. It is reported that the most meticulous and difficult case to review is the emergency measure for land tax and grain after the reform proposed by the Grain Department, because the case includes institutions, funding, personnel, and other items, and the case relates to the reform and innovation of finance and grain. If the review is easily passed, there may be excessive or insufficient shortcomings, and the most important thing in the case is the change in the mechanism. Regarding the proposals of the first group, a small number of personnel are still engaged in review tonight. The general meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow morning has been changed to the afternoon. The holiday on the 9th is suspended, and the general meeting will continue on the 10th. It is expected that the meeting will close on the 10th, at which time Chairman Chiang will be invited to deliver instructions.

The draft is recorded as follows: (1) During the period of temporary collection of in-kind land tax, the central competent authorities are the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food. The division of powers is handled according to the regulations of the Adjustment Plan issued by the Executive Yuan in February 34. (2) At the local level, the provincial, municipal, and county governments are the competent authorities. All business related to the collection, sorting out, and borrowing of grain from land tax will be assigned to the provincial, municipal, and county governments from the 35th year. (3) The various magisterial land tax grain management offices originally established by the central government will be changed to be subordinate to the provincial government, under the command and supervision of the provincial chairman, and under the command of the ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, and will continue to perform their original duties. , County and city-level institutions and storage and transportation institutions at all levels will be transferred accordingly, but the opening period this year is pressing. In order to seize the opportunity and avoid hindering business, the organization, system, and personnel of all levels of institutions will temporarily remain unchanged. All affairs that have not originally established independent institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties shall also be concurrently handled by other agencies, and shall remain the same.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Conference on the Implementation of the Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System held group review sessions both in the morning and afternoon on the 7th. Except for the second group's taxation, which has been reviewed, the first group's land tax and grain, and the third group's budget have not yet been completed. It is scheduled to continue the meeting for review on the morning of the 8th. If the review can be completed at that time, the general meeting will be held in the afternoon. According to the conference schedule, the closing ceremony was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 8th, but because there are too many proposals and the review time is extended, the date of the closing ceremony of the general meeting will be postponed. There are a total of 102 proposals, among which the most important are the "Emergency Measures on Land Tax and Food After the Implementation of the Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System" proposed by the Food Department and the "Regulations on the Collection, Allocation, and Delivery Procedures of National and Local Shared Taxes after the Revision of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System" proposed by the Ministry of Finance, the "Actively Organize Local Taxes and Levies and Eliminate Harsh Taxes and Impose to Enrich Autonomous Financial Resources and Relieve People's Hardship" and the "Adjusted Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget for the Second Half of the 35th Year for Provinces (Cities) and Counties (Cities)", and the review was also the most careful.</p>

After Baird flew to Changchun to prepare for the forward command post of the executive department, the Communist Party has decided to send Rao Shushi as its representative to the forward command post, and will be able to fly from Shenyang to Changchun today. The government's business representative was rumored yesterday to be Niu Xianming, but Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi told reporters today that this matter has not been decided. The government will send another person to go. The four small groups of the executive department in the Northeast are now in Shenyang, Sipingjie, and Fushun.

The executive department received Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order at 4:00 PM yesterday, and one hour later, it issued the order to the Northeast Group. When reporters asked the government authorities whether this ceasefire order also included mobilization, a spokesperson firmly said that only troop movements and the transportation of supplies should be considered exceptions.

President Song personally delivered the opening address, strongly stating that the Chinese people themselves and the UNRRA should do more to alleviate China's suffering.

The Executive Yuan will also consider any suggestions to enhance and accelerate the progress of the work. UNRRA Director-General's representative Rooks also gave a speech, promising to make the greatest efforts to assist China and other countries in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Incident of Mad Massacre of Indigenous People in Dutch East Indies; Thousands of Overseas Chinese Die; East Indies Government Expresses Regret; Our Consul General Flies to Nanjing for Duty Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 6th special dispatch] According to a report from a returning British reconnaissance aircraft last night, fires were seen in the area one hundred square miles west of Tangerang. According to estimates by non-official Chinese and Dutch individuals, approximately three to four thousand overseas Chinese have been victimized. The investigation is still ongoing. The Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Mook, inspected Tangerang this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 7th United Press] As Indonesians retreated from areas around Tangerang, fifteen miles from Batavia, another hundred Chinese were killed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 6th dispatch] The Indonesian Republican Government issued a statement today formally expressing regret over the killing of overseas Chinese in the Tangerang area, twenty miles west of Batavia. It stated that since Indonesian security forces retreated from the Tangerang area and Dutch troops moved in, transportation between the government and the area west of Tangerang has been cut off. Incidents have occurred frequently around that area, creating a hostile environment between the Chinese and Indonesian residents. The government has now ordered an investigation, and once the results are obtained, it will take necessary measures. Chiang Chia-tung, the Chinese Consul General in Batavia, visited Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir yesterday and flew to Nanjing today. According to Xu Qinkai (transliteration), a leader of the overseas Chinese in Tangerang, no refugees have escaped from the west bank of the Tangerang River recently. Therefore, the situation of the 20,000 overseas Chinese west of Tangerang is very worrying. It is estimated that about 4,000 refugees have passed through the city of Tangerang, and about 600 overseas Chinese have been killed. (According to Agence France-Presse, the number of overseas Chinese casualties exceeds 3,000). An Allied headquarters spokesman said that aircraft detected burning villages in the northwest of Tangerang, covering an area of approximately 1.6 million square miles. The city of Tangerang was occupied by Dutch troops on May 28th, and part of the west bank was destroyed by fire. The city is still stable today.</p>
<p>Savage Terror Envelops the Entire Area</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 7th dispatch] Six hundred overseas Chinese were brutally massacred in Chinese villages in the western Tangerang area of Batavia yesterday. The area is still under the terror of killing and looting. The unprecedented ferocity has not yet ceased. Villages throughout the Tangerang area are engulfed in flames today, and savage terror still envelops the entire area. Overseas Chinese women and children have become unfortunate victims of atrocities. It is reported that one thousand Chinese in a certain village were surrounded by invading rioters and were forced to desperately resist with knives and any other weapons they could obtain. Over three thousand overseas Chinese have fled to the Dutch military lines in Tangerang for temporary shelter. It is reported that Dutch troops recently occupied the Tangerang area, and it is believed that Indonesians suspect that the overseas Chinese cooperated with the Dutch military. According to local officials, this may be the cause of the current outbreak of violence.</p>

After agreement between our representatives and the French representatives, a liquidation committee will be formed by both China and France to investigate the source of the materials handed over by the Japanese military. Those that originally belonged to the French side will be returned separately. Our representatives will be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. It is estimated that this work will take three months to complete. However, the French representatives have not yet been designated, so the actual work of the liquidation committee has not yet been able to start before the completion of our army's withdrawal. Our receipts stored in Haiphong, of which those originally belonging to the French party have been verified, have been handed over to the French party for safekeeping, pending liquidation.</p>

Mr. Gillen went on to say that the problem of solving the famine is not only a matter of production but also a matter of transportation. The biggest difficulty China currently faces is this.

Finally, Mr. Gillen hoped that the Chinese people would strive for production and conserve consumption. He is scheduled to leave here for Hong Kong tomorrow morning (9th) and then return to his country.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Merchants in Shanghai Order a Large Amount of Goods</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Kunming, 5th dispatch] The cloth, general merchandise, and cigarettes ordered by Yunnan merchants in Shanghai are said to have reached more than 200 million yuan in recent days.

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Establishes a Planning Committee to Discuss Plans to Promote Economic Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th dispatch] In order to discuss economic plans and promote economic construction, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently announced the establishment of its Planning Committee by ministerial order. The main tasks of this new organization are: 1. To discuss economic issues; 2. To review economic laws and regulations; 3. To plan economic undertakings. The committee will have 40 to 50 members, of which 30 to 40 will be appointed by the Minister from experts in the economic field, and 10 will be filled by senior officials from the ministry.

All members are honorary positions, but they will be paid attendance fees and research fees when attending meetings and undertaking research on specific topics.

<h3>Zhang Qun Flies from Chongqing to Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th dispatch] Zhang Qun, director and acting chairman of the Chongqing Headquarters, met with reporters after returning to Chongqing from Nanjing and stated: He briefly stayed in Shanghai during this departure from Chongqing because he had a close relationship with Shanghai since the Xinhai Revolution. This was his first visit to Shanghai after the Anti-Japanese War. In addition to visiting relatives and friends, he had no other tasks. The personnel matters of the Headquarters have not yet been fully decided. The nature of the work of the Transportation and Economic Committees is still under discussion, so it does not seem necessary to determine personnel matters early. The task of the Headquarters is to supervise and promote the southwest's recommendation. He is ordered to take charge of it. In view of the great responsibility and to achieve the cause of southwestern construction, he will not leave Sichuan for the time being. When asked about the peace negotiations and their possible future, he said: He did not participate in the formal negotiations this time, but he knows that the government's consistent policy is to seek peace. The Double Tenth Agreement and the January 10th ceasefire agreement are ironclad evidence, but the acceptance of sovereignty in the Northeast is unrestricted. The implementation of the military reorganization plan and the restoration of transportation are necessary. The meaning of the Chairman's order to cease fire for fifteen days lies in this. It is hoped that concrete and effective methods can be negotiated and implemented during the ceasefire period. Concessions can be made politically, but the government must maintain the unity of governance.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Zhang Qun flew from Chongqing to Chengdu on a special plane at 1:00 PM on the 7th to attend the provincial council meeting to be held in Chengdu on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Impressions of the International Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 6th, making his first trip in nine years, and took the opportunity to check his health. Reporters paid a visit to his residence yesterday. In addition to his impressions of the current international situation, he also discussed the Northeast issue. Wang believes that, whether from a legal or moral point of view, our country has suffered the most from the long-term war of resistance, and the Northeast is our inherent territory. All industrial equipment, resources, and materials left by the enemy can be regarded as part of the enemy's compensation, and our country has the right to obtain them first. However, since our country fought alongside the Allied forces in this war, the disposal of "war booty" in the Northeast is not only a matter for our country alone. It is reported that Mr. Wang will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Provincial Industry and Mining Friendship Association Provides Loans to Assist Various Factories and Mines</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Appealing on Behalf of Millions of Elementary School Students!</h3>
<p>The education authorities are now engaged in studying and revising the elementary school curriculum standards. Everyone doesn't seem to realize the importance of this matter, but it is enough to affect the happiness of every family. In the past, parents paid little attention to the education system and school curricula, and did not study them, allowing a few experts to impose regulations wholesale. As a result, looking back at the health of children in our families today, how is it? With even a slightly deeper observation, we can't help but feel disheartened.</p>
<p>The elementary school curriculum standards were announced in July of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936] and revised and announced in October of the 31st year [i.e., 1942]. Today, the extremely heavy curriculum given to children in elementary schools across the country has naturally gone through the brains of many experts, but the result is the sacrifice of the health of most children and even the killing of many children's lives. A child of about ten years old has to study more than ten subjects, and there are all kinds of extracurricular activities. How can a fragile child's body support it? How can Chinese children, who are particularly thin and weak, digest it? In the elementary schools of Shanghai, things are even worse. In addition to the curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education, they also add English, or even English and French. Some even add things like "Confucian Classics." Some parents even praise and sing the praises of these schools, not knowing that these schools have in reality become prisons that trap children's bodies and minds.</p>
<p>If we had enough time today to compare our elementary school curriculum with the elementary school curricula of other countries, we would certainly rank first in terms of complexity and quantity! The physical condition of other countries' children is better than ours, their nutrition is better than ours, and their family environment is even better than ours, yet the amount of homework they receive is not more than ours. The weakness of most Chinese parents themselves means that our children already suffer a great loss in terms of congenital factors. After birth, the meager income of parents and the high prices make it very difficult for children to obtain standard nutrition. And after the children return home, most of the family environments are such that either the whole family is crowded into a small room, leaving the children no place to prepare their homework, or the children help with household chores after class, substituting for their parents' labor. How can Chinese children, in these unfavorable circumstances, read more books than others? However, the experts don't care, they don't care about the children's own abilities. They only care about adding more hours of teaching to their own specialized subjects, so that the children are forced to swallow homework that they cannot fully accept. As a result, children who are plump and fat at the age of five or six become thin and weak as soon as they enter schools where the curriculum is poorly managed. Not only is their development delayed, but they also become sallow and emaciated, and some even develop serious lung diseases in secret. If you don't believe it, parents, please examine the bodies and homework of your own children. Can these homework be shouldered by the children? If you ask a doctor to examine them, have many children already planted the seeds of some terrible diseases?</p>
<p>Forcing a child of five or six to about ten years old to get better grades than others is a very dangerous old idea. Because of this idea, I don't know how many children's bodies have been harmed. We have the right to demand that the experts not think that only their own specialized subjects are the most important and that the hours should be the most. You add more, I add more, making the curriculum standards an unreasonable "hodgepodge." We hope to merge the types of homework and reduce the amount. Especially in many elementary schools in Shanghai, the fifth and sixth grades have deeper English, which is not suitable for children's physical development and is even more unsuitable for the country's standpoint. Since the curriculum standards do not stipulate this, it should be strictly prohibited immediately. Today, the excessive burden of the elementary school curriculum is not only destroying the bodies of countless elementary school students invisibly, but also affecting their academic performance after entering middle school and university. For the sake of the entire education for the future of national construction, we can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>Finally, we place our earnest hope on the "experts" who are studying and discussing the revision of the elementary school curriculum standards this time. Do not be "specialized" without being "versatile." Do not hesitate and look around on the old road. Save the innocent and naive elementary school students! They must be liberated from the shackles of the heavy curriculum!</p>

<p>Zhenjiang: Experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Inspect Refugees</p>
<p>A large number of refugees from northern Jiangsu are gathered here, without clothes or food, exposed to the wind and dew. Their situation is extremely pitiful and has attracted the concern of international figures. In order to investigate the actual situation of the refugees, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration specially dispatched refugee experts Louis and Ms. Hua Aidlai on the (4th) to Zhenjiang for an on-site inspection.

<p>Wujiang: Bandit Zhen Was Shot Dead While Trying to Escape</p>
<p>Bandit Ling Yufu, who was skilled in martial arts, served as the leader of the action group of the Loyal Salvation Army during the War of Resistance. He was involved in more than ten cases of kidnapping, extortion, murder, and arson in the areas of Bachai, Tongli, and Pingwang. Many of those who were torn up after being ransomed were also not a few. This time, the county government arrested him on the order of the province. Shen, the district chief of the Luxu District Office, arrested him and sent him to the county. After the secretary Huang Baoyun personally interrogated him, he directly admitted the crimes of kidnapping, arson, and murder. Because it was learned that the bandit was strong and brave, he had tried to escape several times during the journey to the county, but fortunately the guards were very strict and did not succeed. However, on the morning of the 4th, on the pretext of defecation, four soldiers accompanied him. Ling bandit jumped as usual with two pairs of heavy shackles on his feet. After going out, he suddenly seized the rifle held by the escorting soldier, fired two shots, hitting the military cap of the escorting soldier, and then fled forward. When the soldiers saw the important criminal escape, they fired shots to pursue him. The bullet hit a vital part and he died. Local people were relieved to hear the news.</p>
<p>Mingguang: Villagers Who Kill Locusts Are Rewarded with Imported Flour</p>

The Central Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and the county government have successively dispatched locust control specialists to the various townships for inspection and personally supervised the local people to organize locust control teams to carry out the work of eliminating locust nymphs. It is learned that the Bengbu office of the Anhui Relief Branch transported 20 tons of imported flour from Bengbu by car on the morning of the 5th of this month, passing through Mingguang Station and loading it to Zhangbaling Township and other places for distribution to the locust control people as a reward.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Telegram to Jiangxi to Release Zhejiang-Purchased Rice</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is suffering from a severe rice shortage. The Provincial Land and Food Department is encouraging grain merchants to purchase from outside the province in order to regulate people's food supply. According to reports from grain stores such as Daxing, rice has been purchased in eastern Jiangxi, but the Shangrao County Government has prohibited its export and obstructed it in many ways. This matter is related to the supply of food to this province, and according to the central government's clear orders, there should be no obstruction. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Land and Food Management Office is telegraphed to instruct the county to allow the rice to be released and to no longer cause difficulties so that materials from the two provinces can circulate and help each other.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Chairman Shen Orders the County to Collect Military Grain</p>
<p>The collection of military grain in Jiaxing this time has caused a great uproar. Township chiefs have submitted their resignations and sent representatives to the province to petition. As a result, the amount was reduced by 5,000 piculs from 18,000 piculs, with the actual collection being 13,000 piculs. However, the townships still believe that there is no surplus grain to supply during this time of year when the harvest is not yet ripe. After several discussions, there is still no concrete solution. However, Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie telegraphed the county yesterday and the day before yesterday, instructing the county council and the county party department to give good advice and collect the full amount on schedule. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Hu believed that both military grain and people's food should be taken into account and allowed representatives of public opinion to state their actual difficulties.</p>

<h3>Burma Rises Up to Fight for Independence; Rangoon Residents Demonstrate, Demanding the Immediate Withdrawal of British Troops; Indian Princes Discuss Constitutional Plans</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th: Burma, following India, has now risen up to fight for independence, demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops. A large-scale demonstration took place in Rangoon today, with tens of thousands of demonstrators chanting slogans such as "British Troops Get Out of Burma!" and "Long Live Burmese Independence!" The momentum was extremely great. In the British House of Commons, several Conservative Party members submitted a report on the Burmese issue today, stating that assassinations have been occurring daily in Burmese cities recently. So far, 240 people have been killed, and they strongly criticized the government for not taking any action.</p>
<p>Another report: Anti-British demonstrations occurred again in Egypt today. Someone threw a bomb into a movie theater, resulting in the deaths of dozens of British soldiers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Mumbai, 7th] If the negotiations between the British Cabinet delegation and Indian leaders have a smooth outcome, approximately 600 Indian princes will disappear. The Standing Committee of the Council of Princes convened in Mumbai today to discuss the constitutional plan of the British delegation. If this plan is implemented, there will be major changes in the relationship between the Indian states and their internal institutions. In an independent India, only about ten of these ancient monarchs may continue to exist. Countless small countries, the smallest with an area of only a dozen square miles, will inevitably merge and disappear. The King of Hyderabad will undoubtedly continue to exist. He is known as the richest man in the world. The state's area is equal to the total area of England and Scotland, and its population is twice that of Australia. Its collection of pearls, diamonds, and other treasures is worth approximately 500 million pounds, while his personal expenses are only five pounds per month. He himself is a Muslim, but more than three-quarters of his 18 million people are Hindus. Other states, such as Kashmir, with 40 million people, and Mysore in the south, have hopes of being preserved. The total area of the Indian states accounts for one-third of the total area of India, and their population accounts for one-quarter. Among them, some have responsible governments, while others have a hereditary system of personal rule. The main issue at the Mumbai meeting is whether the princes will be forced to appoint the eighty representatives that each state is entitled to in the Constituent Assembly, or whether the opinions of the people of each state must be solicited. It is heard that Travancore and Cochin have expressed the principle of creating popular elections.</p>
<h3>Argentina and the Soviet Union Establish Diplomatic Relations; The Soviet Union Once Accused Argentina of Having Fascist Characteristics</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio broadcast that the governments of the Soviet Union and Argentina, based on the great principle that nations of the world should cooperate and understand each other, have established diplomatic relations. This is the first time the two countries have had diplomatic relations since the First World War. When the United Nations held a conference in San Francisco in 1945, the Soviet Union accused the Argentine government of having fascist characteristics. In 1940, Argentina also used the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland as an excuse to request the former League of Nations to expel the Soviet Union from the League, and was granted permission by the League of Nations. However, since Colonel Perón was elected President of Argentina, there was hope of restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In fact, Perón was also a key figure in the "fascist" regime last year.</p>
<p>[Also, report from the capital of Argentina] Argentine President Perón received reporters for the first time today and announced that Argentina has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Soviet newspapers said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina will generate extensive trade).</p>

<h3>On the Franco Issue, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Disagree Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th, United Press] Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union once again engaged in a heated dispute at the Security Council meeting today on the proposal to sever diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain. The Soviet Union demanded that the Security Council order all United Nations members to immediately sever relations with Franco's Spain. Britain and the United States vehemently argued that this move would not only fail to weaken Franco, but would instead strengthen his rule. Any further decisive action would be enough to cause a Spanish civil war.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, New York, 6th] The United Nations Security Council met today to discuss the Franco investigation report of the Council's subcommittee. No decision was made, and it was decided to discuss it again next Thursday.

<h3>Strive to Ensure Peace with the Spirit of Winning Victory; Eisenhower's Speech on the Anniversary of the Landing in Europe</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, New York, 6th] In a special radio broadcast on the second anniversary of the US military's landing in northern France, US Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower asked the American people to build peace with the same effort and sacrifice as they won the victory in the war. Eisenhower declared: "I will never tire of praising the American soldiers. But the struggle that American soldiers began and carried out has not yet been completed. Only when the world has achieved a solid and just peace can our efforts end. The victory won with bloodshed and sacrifice requires our efforts and sacrifice to ensure peace. The American people have taken this goal as their own responsibility, and they have authorized the armed forces through Congress to be responsible for implementing the enemy's surrender conditions. Only in this way can the foundation of peace be laid." He warned the American people: "If our efforts for peace falter, it will be our own fault. We must not fail. We have already gone through a terrible war. A little more effort and sacrifice can reduce the possibility of another war."</p>

<p>[United Press, Hungarian Capital] Hungary issued a new banknote with a face value of 100 million million Hungarian pengős on June 3. The degree of inflation is getting higher, and the country has been shaken. Elementary school teachers have gone on strike as a result, and all elementary schools in the Hungarian capital have been closed. In the past, such a new banknote was worth 2 million million US dollars before the war, but today it is not even worth one dollar.

<h3>The Italian Republican Government Will Be Established Next Week; President Elected on the 26th; It Is Rumored That Umberto Attempted Suicide; The Queen and Her Children Depart for Portugal by Ship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 6th] The Italian Constituent Assembly has decided to elect a temporary president of the republic on the 24th of this month. It is uncertain whether any of the leaders of the three major parties are willing to take on this role. Prime Minister Gasperi has made it clear that he wishes to continue his political activities. Potential presidential candidates among prominent figures in the political arena include Orlando, Prime Minister during World War I; Bonomi, the first Prime Minister after the war; Sforza, the former Foreign Minister and renowned political writer; and Basia Dati, leader of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>A local radio station recently announced that the establishment of the Italian Republic will be postponed until next week. The reason for this is that the election office has received 36,000 reports that must be carefully studied.</p>
<p>King Umberto II advised Queen Marie-José to leave the country yesterday at midnight. This morning at 5:30 AM, the Queen and several of her children boarded the cruiser "Abruzzi" to go abroad. The ship was originally ordered to sail to Alexandria, but the route was later changed. Although King Farouk of Egypt invited Umberto II's family to Alexandria to live with the deposed King Ahmed Fouad II, Queen Marie-José had already received permission from the Portuguese government to take refuge in Lisbon and thus declined the Egyptian King's invitation. Umberto II will also go to Lisbon.</p>

<h3>Japanese Emperor's Tour: Poor People Cheer, Women Weep; Returned to the Palace by Car Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan arrived in Chiba Prefecture today. As he walked through a rubble-strewn area of about 300 yards, thousands of impoverished people affected by the war cheered enthusiastically. Military police carrying rifles closely followed the attendants. The Emperor had no other guards. Several women cried aloud. Hirohito stopped twice to comfort disabled veterans wearing Red Cross insignia. This was the last day of the Emperor's second tour to encourage people to engage in reconstruction work. When he stepped up the mountain to hear responsible officials report on the city's reconstruction work, his attitude seemed calmer than in previous visits. Before returning to the palace, the Emperor personally comforted 400 repatriated Japanese and their families about their living conditions. They are engaged in cultivating a farm that was previously a cavalry training ground, where the Emperor inspected troops every year before the war. At noon, Hirohito returned to the palace in a large black car. The trip covered more than 200 miles, and he met with 200,000 to 300,000 people.</p>

<h3>Reform of the Japanese Police System: American Expert Proposes Three Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] American police expert Valentine, dispatched by MacArthur, has been investigating the police system in various parts of Japan for two months. He has now publicly released a report, putting forward three recommendations as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The police should be subject to the administrative jurisdiction of each city, and the administration of each city should be directly responsible to the voters. (2) The recruitment and treatment of police must be improved. (3) Police powers should be limited to police affairs. Matters within judicial authority should not be overstepped. For example, inspecting news and interfering in private life or private affairs were common in the past but must be stopped in the future. In short, the police are the servants of the nation, not the masters of the nation.</p>
<h3>Three Major Japanese Shipping Companies Placed on Blacklist</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] MacArthur Headquarters recently issued a bulletin stating that the Allied Headquarters has officially placed the three major Japanese shipping companies, namely Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK), and Yamashita Kisen, as well as their affiliated companies, on the blacklist. Before and during the war, these three major companies were the backbone of the Japanese merchant fleet. Without these companies, Japan would not have been able to participate in international trade and become one of the powerful nations before the war. Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) holds 480 million yen, Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK) holds 581 million yen, and Yamashita Kisen holds 186 million yen. There are 84 small companies affiliated with these companies.</p>

<h3>Jewels Vanish From German Ancient Palace Basement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 6th] A set of German royal jewels, valued at US$1.5 million, has disappeared from a German ancient palace, which was once used as an American officers' club.

<h3>Who Actually Received Subsidies? British Home Secretary Says Fascist Leader Received Mussolini Subsidies; Mosley Says "Daily Herald" Received Soviet Subsidies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] British Home Secretary Ede announced in the House of Commons today that Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British fascist organization "British Union," had received subsidies from Mussolini. A letter from the former Italian ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini was found in Mussolini's documents. Mosley issued a statement in response, saying: "According to Lord Snowden's biography, the British government issued a communiqué stating that the Soviet representative in Britain, Kamenev, told the Soviet government that diamonds worth 40,000 pounds had been sold and the money had been handed over to the Daily Herald." The industrial organization "Daily Herald" categorically denied the fascist leader Mosley's claim that the "Daily Herald" had accepted a 40,000-pound subsidy from the Soviet Union 25 years ago. It made the following footnote to Mosley's statement: On September 19, 1921, the Communist International gave 60,000 pounds to Maynard, then one of the directors of this newspaper, to solve the financial difficulties. After being discovered by other directors, they unanimously opposed it. Maynard was therefore removed from office, and the money was returned to the original owner.</p>

<h3>Captured After the Fall of Hong Kong; Former Director of the "Commercial Control": Lin Kanghou Denies Collaborating With the Enemy, Cries Injustice, Transfers Part of the United Chemical Factory</h3>
<p>— Messenger Witness Wang Zhisan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The suspected treason case of Lin Kanghou, one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai, was first heard in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Lin was wearing a dark blue jacket, flannel trousers, a light blue striped shirt, a purple-red and black tie, modern glass, green sunglasses, and a bamboo folding fan, giving him a Western gentleman's demeanor. Lin Kanghou in the defendant's column (Photograph by Chuang)</p>
<p>Lin is a Shanghainese, 70 years old, who has been in the education and finance industries. He once served as the Deputy Minister of Finance. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was arrested along with Li Sihao and others and detained in Hong Kong. He was then escorted back to Shanghai by enemy aircraft until March of the 32nd year. When the puppet government established the "Commercial Control Council" in Shanghai, Lin served as the director and secretary-general of the council. In June of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, handling relief work in Shanghai, and transferred the original alcohol manufacturing machines of the United Chemical Factory, which he co-founded with Wang Zhisan and others, to the Japanese side for 1 million yuan. However, according to Lin, the prosecutor's so-called "defection and collaboration with the enemy" is a complete injustice. Because during his stay in Shanghai, he refused all threats and inducements from the enemy puppets, he was wanted by the puppet government. Among the 83 people on the blacklist published by the puppet government, the first name was Jiang Bocheng, and the third was himself. Therefore, he had no choice but to flee to Hong Kong. When the Pacific War broke out in the 30th year, he was captured after the fall of Hong Kong and detained for 104 days, but he still did not yield. On April 15th of the 31st year, he was escorted back to Shanghai by the Japanese side. Until June, he was still not satisfied with the Japanese puppets and was arrested by the enemy police. In March of the 32nd year, when the puppet Commercial Control Council was established, more than 20 directors and supervisors were appointed, and none of them were forced to serve. Therefore, the defendant did not defect to the enemy but was invited to serve by the puppet government on the grounds that it was "beneficial to industry and commerce." In fact, from May of the 32nd year to June of the 33rd year, during Tang Shoumin's term as "Director Wei," it was the period of implementing material control and distribution. At this time, he was only a nominal director. By July of the 33rd year, after Wen Lanting headed the Commercial Control Council, he invited Lin to be the secretary-general four times, saying that he wanted to reduce the scope of the "Commercial Control" and lay off redundant staff to do his best to preserve the work. By the end of August 10th of last year, more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn were still stored. Wen Lanting telegraphed Chairman Jiang specifically to ask for instructions on how to deal with it, and received a reply ordering them to keep it properly. In the end, the Ministry of Economy sent personnel to take over the entire quantity. Therefore, not only did he not carry out the collection and distribution of materials, but he also preserved materials for the country. At this time, the defendant's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, presented two pieces of evidence: (1) A handwritten letter from Wen Lanting, proving that the defendant only did administrative work during his tenure as secretary-general of the "Commercial Control Council." (2) The blacklist in the wanted order issued by the Wang puppet regime.</p>
<p>Lin also claimed that during the Anti-Japanese War, the defendant suffered deeply, and his patriotic heart arose spontaneously. Therefore, the defendant was the first to run to Chongqing at the end of the 26th year of the Republic. After serving as secretary-general in July of the 33rd year, he laid off all the Japanese staff in the "Commercial Control Council." In June of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Government Advisory Committee due to the invitation of the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo, which he could not refuse. The work was only to attend a meeting once a month, where the municipal government reported on the work of the past month. The defendant used to engage in charitable activities, so he also took on relief work. As for the United Chemical Factory, after the defendant came to Shanghai in the 31st year, he served as a director and did his best to help United resist the Japanese side's seizure of its alcohol manufacturing machines until the end of the 32nd year. Later, the factory's machines were leased to the American Chemical Factory, and a Japanese man, Uetani, was hired as a consultant to cover up. As a result, because the Japanese side needed alcohol, it forcibly purchased it for 1 million yuan. This matter has nothing to do with the defendant. Moreover, the defendant's investment in the factory was only 67,500 out of 3.15 million puppet currency, so he was a small shareholder, which is inconsistent with what is stated in the indictment. The court summoned witness Wang Zhisan, a native of Zhenhai, 48 years old, who was a shareholder of United Chemical Factory. After inquiring about the capital and machines of the factory, the hearing was adjourned for another day. Lin's family members attended the hearing yesterday, but Lin did not request to see them.</p>
<h3>Zhou Bangjun Is Much Fatter, Presents Many Counter-Evidence</h3>
<p>Zhou Bangjun, a native of Changshu, Jiangsu, 58 years old, lives at 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinlan Road. He graduated from an American church school in 1909 and has served as the director of the Central Military Hospital, the director of the Military Medical Office, the chief medical officer of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, the manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy, and the general manager of the Star Perfume Factory. Since the 29th year of the Republic, he participated in puppet organizations, serving as a member of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, a member of the Anti-British and American Association, and the deputy director of the Municipal Baojia Preparatory Office. He also provided the trucks of Zhongxi Pharmacy for the use of the enemy army. The case was tried by Judge Cao Jun in the Criminal Court No. 1 at around 10:00 yesterday morning. When the defendant entered the court, he was wearing a blue cloth long gown and black leather shoes, and his voice was slightly hoarse. According to his statement, the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association had 200 to 300 members, all of whom were forced to join from all walks of life. He only attended once because "businessmen have little interest in culture," so he did nothing at all, and only learned from the newspapers that the association had held a calligraphy and painting exhibition. As for being a member of the "Anti-British and American Association," he claimed that he was also forced to be invited. The "General Secretary" Chen Ya'fu invited them to a dinner at the International Hotel, and the association was established on the spot. He did not want to join, but Chen Ya'fu threatened him with the Japanese Secretary Sakata, so he joined, but he did not participate in the "People's Congress" in the racecourse. Zhou供: Bangjun participated in the revolution in the first year of the Republic and has always been a backbone of the Anti-Japanese War. How could he be so mad as to be against Britain and the United States. As for the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Preparatory Committee, he claimed that six bombing incidents occurred in the eastern district of the Public Concession at the end of the lunar year of the 31st year of the Republic, which led to a large blockade by the Japanese army. Residents within the area around Xizang Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, and the Bund were not allowed to enter or leave, and some even starved to death. The situation was extremely dangerous, so a "Baojia Committee" was formed in the name of representatives from industry and commerce to negotiate with the Japanese side to lift the blockade, which was beneficial to the people. The actual organization of the Baojia was handled by the puppet police bureau, and he did nothing. Later, the judge asked Zhou about his relationship with Chu Minyi. He claimed: "His sister's Miss is Bangjun's daughter-in-law, but they don't have much contact." As for why Wang Yongkang knew Chu Minyi, it was not through his introduction, but because Chu Minyi built the Tang Monk Pagoda in Nanjing in the 33rd year, Wang Yongkang donated money, so he knew him. The court decided to summon Wang Yongkang next time to confront him in court. As for Zhou's use of Zhongxi Pharmacy's trucks for the factory, he said it was robbery and not voluntary. Finally, Zhou presented several pieces of evidence in his favor: (1) He used 3 million yuan to help the radio station of the Military Affairs Department in Shanghai. (2) He helped the families of anti-Japanese martyrs, and Ms. Lu Huimin, the wife of Du Gang, testified in court. (3) He donated 1,000 sets of military uniforms to the Military Affairs Commission. (4) He helped British man Fercuson. (5) He assisted Tongde Medical College. (6) He rescued Bi Gaokui. The court ordered the summons of witnesses and another hearing. After the adjournment, Zhou Bangjun met with his family. His daughter and nephews all said, "We haven't seen you in September, you've gotten much fatter." Zhou replied with a smile, "It doesn't matter, this is just a storm."</p>
<h3>Gathering Famous Actors and Opera Enthusiasts in One Hall: Charity Performance to Benefit the Northeast for Two Nights, Program Preview</h3>
<p>After the restoration of the Northeast, Madame Chiang Kai-shek initiated the Northeast Relief Association in Chongqing. The fundraising matters in Shanghai were entrusted to Du Yuesheng as the team leader, and Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others as the deputy team leaders. In addition to the 100 million yuan that Team Leader Du had already raised and remitted in advance, it was also decided that from June 11th, famous actors and opera enthusiasts would be invited to perform a charity performance at the Tianchan Stage for three days, and the proceeds would be used for relief expenses.

Gathering famous actors and opera enthusiasts in one hall, performing in the same opera, is a rare and sought-after good show that has not been seen in the past ten years. Opera fans have been rushing to buy tickets and reserve seats.</p>
<h3>Curfew to Be Lifted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of the curfew in this city, it has been quite effective in terms of public security; however, the public feels greatly inconvenienced, and the impact on general night market operators has been particularly significant. Now that daylight saving time has been advanced by one hour, and the summer heat is steaming, staying indoors feels hot and stuffy. According to reliable sources, the authorities have discussed this matter and intend to lift the curfew soon, which should be seen in fact soon.</p>
<h3>Poverty, Ignorance, and Abandoned Homes: The Causes of Rampant Cholera - A Crisis Looms in Lujiazhaing</h3>
<p>"After a great war, there will inevitably be a great epidemic!" It seems this saying will come true in Shanghai this year. Ask any elder in Shanghai; when have they ever seen cholera begin to spread before the Dragon Boat Festival? Despite the meteorological observatory's report that this summer will not be too hot, the reality proves otherwise: these past few days have been as hot as midsummer. Coupled with a severe drought, it is the perfect breeding ground for rampant cholera! Abandoned homes, poverty, and ignorance further exacerbate the opportunities for cholera to flourish. Shanghai is not lacking in high-rise buildings, but the war has brought poverty! In Zhabei and Nanshi, countless families are living hellish lives!</p>
<p>I want to cite a specific example. Near the Lujiazhaing vegetable market in Nanshi, there is a large mound of earth. The origin of this mound is easy to surmise: the base of the mound contains orderly foundations, which were, of course, once proper houses before the war. After the Japanese troops entered, a great fire erupted in Nanshi, and these houses became piles of rubble. The nearby residents have been dumping basket after basket of garbage onto this rubble every day, truly building a tower of sand. Now, garbage, excrement, and the original rubble have accumulated to a height of seven or eight feet.</p>
<p>As a result, those impoverished people who cannot afford to live in high-rise buildings have built ten or so shacks along the base of the mound. These shacks must be built close to the mound because the mound itself serves as a wall, saving them the cost of several reed mats. They simply erect a bamboo frame, cover it with reed mats, and top it with some grass, considering themselves to be "living in a hut amidst human dwellings." These shacks are not independent; they are simply small spaces partitioned by reed mats, each space housing a family. The largest family has a horizontal space of eleven feet and a depth of probably less than ten feet, with no windows and no drainage ditches.</p>
<p>And most of these shack dwellers are selling food! They make flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and wontons at their doorways. One family even sells rice. Flies buzz around, and phlegm is spat everywhere. Yet, they seem to be thriving daily!</p>
<p>Across the mound, facing these shacks from afar, is a very tall and large building. On its snow-white walls, large characters, seven or eight feet square, are written: "Nanshi Funeral Home."</p>
<p>Sixteen or seventeen steps south of the mound is the Lujiazhaing vegetable market, which is crowded with customers every day. Every morning, more vegetable scraps and fruit peels are dumped onto the mound; every morning, many housewives buy flatbreads and fried dough sticks from the stalls in these shacks to take home for breakfast.</p>
<p>If cholera spreads to such places, what will happen? It must be understood that this is not the only shantytown in Shanghai!</p>
<p>If we drive them out, where will they go? Nanshi is currently undergoing a major construction boom, but these new houses are only slightly taller than the shacks, with reed mats on the roofs replaced by tiles and a layer of yellow mud plastered on the walls. In the event of a fire, the consequences would be unthinkable, and if cholera were to break out, there would be absolutely no possibility of quarantine!</p>
<p>Most people are unwilling to get vaccinated against cholera, saying, "The Japanese are gone, so why get a shot!" I think this is a time when mandatory injections are necessary! (Pingzhai)</p>
<h3>"King of Metals" Zhang Lianfang - Once Presented Steel to the Enemy Army</h3>
<p>Zhang Lianfang, known as the "King of Metals," is from Ningbo, 47 years old, and resides at 116 Siming Village, Foch Road. He established Hengda Xiang Hardware Store in Shanghai. From 1936, he served as the chairman of the Hardware Trade Association. At the end of 1941, under the control of the puppet regime, the so-called United Office of Hardware and Steel was established in Shanghai's hardware industry, and Zhang became the director of the Hardware Group of the office. He collected more than 1,200 tons of steel and hardware from the industry and presented it to the enemy's naval department, and 700 to 800 tons to the army department. Later, during his tenure as the chief of the sixth pao of the second joint bao of the puppet Huangpu District and as the chairman of the Shanghai Special City Hardware Trade Association, he also promoted the donation of iron, which benefited the enemy. During interrogation yesterday, Zhang stubbornly argued: The donation of iron was a matter for all bao chiefs, he was forced to do it, and he never attended any bao chief meetings.</p>
<p>Li Haoju and others</p>
<p>In addition, several other people were interrogated on the same day, including Li Haoju, a native of Guangdong, director of the Shanghai office of the puppet Postal Administration. According to his confession, he was the consul general in Manila before the war, and his nephew was the son-in-law of the traitor Wang Jingwei. He originally did business, but was "persuaded" by the traitor Chen Junhui to join the puppet postal bureau. Also, enemy intelligence agent Ma Le, Zhou Ding, chief of the puppet secret service radio machinery section, Qian Jieyi, councilor of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, and others were also interrogated and scheduled for further questioning.</p>
<p>Also, the case of Li Ze, general manager of the New New Company, was announced today.</p>
<p>Qiu Junlian Released on Bail After Sentencing</p>
<p>Also, the case of Qiu Junlian, suspected of being a traitor, has been concluded after trial. Yesterday, the verdict was announced: Qiu Junlian was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist his own country, deprived of civil rights for two years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family. However, Qiu was granted bail due to the relatively minor nature of his crimes. It is said that this is an unprecedented move since the High Court began trying traitors.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Repatriating German Nationals: Criteria for Staying or Leaving Should be Established</h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city skyrocketed rapidly after April 15th, once reaching a peak of 63,000 per shi. The central government dispatched a special envoy to Shanghai to investigate thoroughly, and promptly arrested four "rice weevils" suspected of hoarding and profiteering: Wu Rongsheng, manager of San Tai Rice Store; Wang Xunzhi, deputy manager of Changjiang Enterprise Company; Wang Meile, accountant; and Zhuang Hanzhang, business director. After more than ten days of investigation, evidence was obtained confirming that these rice weevils used grain loans to speculate and hoard. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 5 p.m., they were transferred to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for strict punishment in accordance with the temporary regulations on food management during the illegal emergency period. According to reporters, the crimes of these four rice weevils in endangering people's food supply and the process of their use of grain loans are as follows: (1) After obtaining a grain loan of 60 million yuan on April 15, Changjiang Enterprise Company purchased 1,848 shi and 5 dou of rice in the Songjiang area and transported it to Shanghai, hoarding it in warehouses for a month before selling part of it at a high price. In addition, it was found that a total of 2,017 bags and 150 shi of rice were secretly stored in various warehouses without being registered in accordance with the regulations, and all of them have now been sealed by our military authorities. (2) Wu Rongsheng, manager of San Tai Rice Store, was entrusted by the Grain Administration Office in early May to sell 11,000 bags of rice to stabilize the rice price. However, Wu delayed for several days, and the rice price soared. From May 11th to 22nd, he sold 4,530 bags in 13 days, but only half of them were sold to retail rice stores in accordance with the law, causing the rice price to continue to soar in a straight line. Wu made huge illegal profits from this, and the proceeds from the sales were not immediately remitted to the Grain Department, but were deposited in the Central Trust Bureau for turnover and use. The remaining unsold rice was hoarded in warehouses under the name of "San Tai" to seek profiteering. It is reported that the Military Law Department opened an investigation court yesterday morning to interrogate the four rice weevils, Wu Rongsheng, and will announce the full picture of the case within a few days. In addition, the Grain Loan Audit Committee entrusted the Daming Accounting Firm to audit the accounts of 16 grain loan merchants, and notified the 16 grain loan merchants to submit all relevant accounts for audit immediately.</p>
<p>The city authorities are handling the repatriation of German nationals. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified each German national to prepare accordingly, and the municipal government will carry out the concentration and transportation in batches back to their country. The first batch will consist of nearly 1,000 people. These Germans are not all government officials and Nazi party members; even those who have never asked about politics and only engaged in business are included in the repatriation list. The government's measures for dealing with German nationals originally had provisions for allowing technicians and other well-behaved individuals to apply for residence in China. Many of them have gone through registration, guarantee, application, and other procedures, but now that they are all being repatriated uniformly, the previous procedures are equivalent to being invalid, and many Germans are suffering from not knowing what to do. Moreover, there are a few who have applied for naturalization, and even those who have been doing business in China for three generations or who were born in China already consider Shanghai as their second hometown. If their businesses are all destroyed and they leave empty-handed, they cannot help but feel sadness. It is reported that several well-known figures in this city who are familiar with the situation of German nationals believe that during the Anti-Japanese War, when resources were transferred inland, some relied on Germans to come forward to cover them up, and even some central government officials and underground workers were rescued from danger by Germans. Now that they are all being repatriated uniformly, it seems to lack fair criteria and loses the grace of a great power. The government should, from the standpoint of a great nation, stipulate criteria for German nationals to stay or leave, and carefully distinguish them one by one. Those who should be repatriated should be repatriated, those who should be allowed to reside should be allowed to reside, and those who should be allowed to naturalize should be allowed to naturalize. And those who should be naturalized should also set another procedure for finding a guarantor to prevent malpractice. If it can be handled in this way, then Germans can be convinced from the heart.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives from Tibet - Paid a Visit to Mayor Wu Yesterday - Two Wishes for This Trip to Shanghai - To Listen to Mei Opera and See Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the representatives from Tibet attending the National Assembly and celebrating the victory of the Anti-Japanese War arrived in Shanghai, they went to the municipal government to pay a visit to Mayor Wu yesterday morning at 8:30, led by the monk representative Zhasha Lama Tubdan Sangpi and the secular representative Zhasha Keimanba Solang Wangdui, a total of more than 20 people. Mayor Wu welcomed them with a tea party in the auditorium of the municipal government, with Yixi Bozhen, a commissioner of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, serving as the interpreter. During the tea party, Mayor Wu said in his speech: "It is a great pleasure to gather with Tibetan compatriots today, like brothers. I regret that I cannot speak Tibetan. I deeply hope that compatriots in the inland can also go to Tibet. I have only been in Shanghai for a short time, and I apologize for any shortcomings." Afterwards, the mountain representative gave a reply: "It is also a regret that I cannot speak Mandarin." This time to Shanghai, they hope to visit the yarn factory and power plant (scheduled to visit on the morning of the 8th), watch Mei Opera, and climb the International Hotel to get a panoramic view of Shanghai. They then discussed their itinerary in Shanghai. Finally, Mayor Wu raised his glass to wish the Dalai Lama good health, and the tea party ended in joy. Secretary He respectfully escorted them to the gate of the municipal government, and the representatives went to Zhongshan Park for sightseeing and visited the Jing'an Temple.

<h3>Nazi Ill-Gotten Funds in China - A Huge Amount Escaped</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, this city, 7th dispatch] Reliable sources told the United Press Agency today that: Nazi funds in China, totaling several hundred million US dollars, some belonging to German officials currently on trial in Nuremberg, and some belonging to Nazi organizations and wealthy German merchants who were formerly active in the occupied areas of China, have reportedly safely escaped the country and are hidden in Argentina. It is said that China recently received a request for the repatriation of more than 1,500 Nazi "problem" figures, and the transfer of these Nazi funds has therefore accelerated. It is estimated that between US$5 million and US$10 million of Nazi funds have "seeped" out of China in the past three or four months.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] Cholera is rampant in this city, and the situation is becoming more serious. There were eleven new cases yesterday, bringing the total to 101 as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Traffic in This City - Public Buses to Add Routes and Vehicles</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Traffic chaos and difficulty walking in the city center. The reporter yesterday made a special visit to the Municipal Public Works Bureau. According to Deputy Director Zhang Rentao, the Public Works Bureau, in view of the insufficient number of existing vehicles, had purchased vehicles from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration," but because the vehicles were not suitable for current needs, it has now changed to purchasing 45 trucks from the Shanghai Materials Supply Bureau. After modification, they will be used as public buses. It is expected that more than a dozen vehicles can be assembled by the end of this month and can be put into use immediately. The routes have not yet been finalized. However, this type of vehicle is only a temporary remedy, and will be sent to the suburbs for secondary use after the traffic is restored in the future. As for the widely rumored plan to purchase diesel buses from the United States, it is not true. Deputy Director Zhang continued: The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau Public Bus Preparatory Committee will be established no later than next month. The capital is about 10 million yuan, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, and a large number of public buses will be purchased. At that time, the existing routes of British and French businesses will be leased for use.</p>
<p>The British Tram Concession Expires Next Year</p>
<p>As for the number of trams, it is difficult to increase it for a while, because the commercial contract between the British Tram Company and our Changju will expire next year (the public bus contract will expire in four years). After that, it will be taken over by the Public Works Bureau. Regarding the transfer of vehicles by ferry, it is currently underway, but there are still many difficulties, such as the need to reconstruct the wharf, dredge the Huangpu River (this must be coordinated with the work of the Pu Bureau), collect and manufacture special ships, and prepare "vehicle storage rooms," so it may be difficult to implement for a while.</p>
<h3>Suburban Traffic - Restoring as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>As for suburban traffic, try to open it up as much as possible. Vehicle owners can contact the original specialized institutions for proper negotiation, register with the Public Works Bureau, and then they can be used. Passenger cars are now running on various roads, such as the Hu Tai Road.</p>
<h3>Reconstructing Shanxi Road Bridge and Widening Huashan Road</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has recently decided to demolish the decayed parts of the Shanxi Road Bridge, replace them with new materials, widen the bridge surface to 28.8 feet, and reduce the slope. It is estimated that it will cost 200 million yuan. Once public funds are allocated, it can be completed within two months. In addition, the 478-meter-long northern section of Huashan Road, connecting Fanhua Du Road and Changshu Road, is the north-south trunk road in the western part of the city's Huangpu District. Currently, its road is narrow, making driving dangerous. The Shanghai British and French tram companies have been ordered to</p>

It was recently heard that the Police General Bureau specifically commended the branch for refusing bribes. The rail connection between Jingxi Road and Changshu Road needs to be widened, and it has been decided to widen it to 25 meters in principle.</p>
<h3>Housing Allocation Committee Huang Boqiao Resigns</h3>

<h3>Increased Supply Brings Calm; Rice Market Peaceful; Stable Passage Through the Lean Season Expected</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The food problem has eased since the authorities began strict investigations. Holders of goods are releasing their stocks, and sources of supply are continuously increasing. Market prices are falling, in stark contrast to the surge last month. However, the general public still hopes that the authorities will severely punish those rice merchants who caused trouble in the past, as a warning to others. It is now learned that the 1,000 tons of imported rice remaining in Shanghai were officially unloaded yesterday morning (the 7th) and temporarily stored in the Ministry of Food's warehouse. Distribution will be handled after the Ministry of Food issues instructions. The remaining 2,200 tons will be shipped to Huludao within days to aid the people of North China. Previous reports of shipment to Beijing were inaccurate. Furthermore, the imported rice ordered by the Ministry of Food has begun to arrive in batches and will continue to arrive in Shanghai. According to Mayor Wu, he is very confident in the food supply in Shanghai and believes that the city can safely pass through this three-month lean season. Rice merchants who violate food control regulations and non-rice merchants engaged in the rice trade will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jiang Han, the manager of the China National Grain Industry Corporation, is still in Shanghai overseeing the purchase of imported rice. The company, currently based in Chongqing, will soon establish a new agency in Shanghai to be responsible for purchasing imported rice and other related business. It is also planning to send key personnel to the United States and then to South America for investigation. It is understood that the locations under consideration for ordering grain include Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Ecuador. It is said that all import duties on imported rice can be completely waived.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Fall by Small Amounts of 3,000 to 5,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market experienced sluggish digestion due to the increasingly hot weather. The supply of Wuhu and Nanjing indica rice surged, leading to a sharp decline of about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Lower-grade japonica rice also fell by small amounts of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, while higher-grade rice fell by small amounts of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Flour declined by 1,000 yuan, bran fell by another 400 to 500 yuan, soybeans remained flat and sluggish, with slight declines of a few hundred to a thousand yuan. Corn and red beans were stagnant, while wheat and sesame showed little fluctuation. After several days of sharp declines, the price of new soybeans was already low, and they changed hands at 11,000 yuan. The market was generally flat. According to the rice market report yesterday, there were more than 4,000 piculs of rice, including 195 piculs of Baiyuan rice. The breakdown of the quantities is as follows: 2,717 piculs of white japonica, 106 piculs of Yang indica, 195 piculs of Baiyuan, 933 piculs of thin rice, 245 piculs of Du indica, 15 piculs of Yin rice, 687 piculs of early rice, and 90 piculs of Wuhu indica.</p>
<h3>Short Selling in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Public bonds were slightly volatile yesterday as the pressure from short sellers increased. The longs also wanted to gain an advantage. The "Tong Bing" bonds opened in the morning with makers deliberately driving up the price, shouting as high as 6,500 yuan, making it very difficult to sell. Soon, the price gradually declined, and the supply surged. Due to the pressure from short sellers, the price gradually fell to 5,700 yuan before stabilizing. At noon, the result was around 5,850 yuan, down 400 yuan from the previous close. After the close, the price was shouted up again to over 6,000 yuan. "Jia" and "Yi" bonds also fell by 200 yuan, "Ding" bonds by 400 yuan, and "Wu" bonds by 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Slight Decline in Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Gold yesterday was still influenced by the strength of the US dollar. Although the announcement of the ceasefire led some longs to liquidate their positions, the price fell gradually from 1.835 million to 1.815 million in the morning. However, some locals still held a positive view on gold and foreign exchange despite the peace news and absorbed gold when prices were low. The market soon stabilized slightly, hovering around 1.83 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank allocated 136 bars of gold to the industry at a price of 1.83 million. Subsequently, the US dollar performed increasingly well, indirectly boosting the gold market. Before noon, the price had rebounded to over 1.86 million, but it was around 1.855 million at noon. The market softened slightly in the afternoon, and the price was forced to fall slightly under the pressure of the Central Bank's sales. The final result was a decline of 20,000 from the previous close. Jewelry gold was 190,000, silver was 2,200, silver dollars were slightly stable, and the interbank lending market was even tighter, with interest rates around 13%.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Settlement Busy After Foreign Exchange Feels Restraint</h3>
<p>Foreign currencies, especially US dollars, were extremely popular, and there was a rush to settle transactions for reserve purposes. The market opened around 2,370 yuan in the morning. After opening, the price briefly declined to below 2,350 yuan due to the downturn in the gold market. As the situation stabilized slightly, a surge of settlement transactions pushed the price up to 2,490 yuan before leveling off slightly. In the afternoon, the price fell slightly due to some foreign merchants offering sales, resulting in an increase of 50 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly flat at 430 yuan, as was the rupee at 525, with some sales. The US exchange rate was nominally flat but actually tight, and transactions were not easy.</p>
<p>Stable Cloth Market</p>
<p>Demand for winter goods from buyers in the cloth market remained strong, so the market could maintain stability. The supply of grey fabrics did not loosen significantly, but dyeing factories collected a considerable amount in recent days. However, procurement under the root rate system is not as active as before, and the supply from the China Textile Corporation has increased slightly. Nevertheless, popular goods are still not readily available, so the trend is peaceful, with mixed ups and downs in the market.</p>
<h3>Mixed Fortunes in Yarn Market; Current Cotton Trading Very Good</h3>
<p>In yesterday's yarn market, 20-count "Luma" yarn initially rose by 20,000, with 1.26 million units traded. However, as the factory intended to offer sales, the price fell again. Sellers of 20-count small-scale yarn were eager to sell, leading to a decline of about 10,000. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn for sale as usual. The 20-count popular yarn in the market had three brands available: Yunpeng, Yanghe, and Lanfeng. Dealers were less enthusiastic, and fewer purchase orders were placed than in the past. The opening price for 42-count yarn was reduced by 140,000 from the previous period, and the prices of other counts were also reduced by 20,000 to 100,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton fell slightly by 2 to 5 points. The near-term was US$28.24, the far-term was 28.63, and the spot Metterlin was 28.84. Spot cotton trading in this city continued to be good, with Jia Zhao, Fuxin, and small factories in the interior making purchases. Market prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Platinum Prices Soar After US Lifts Price Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] Since the Office of Price Administration lifted price controls, the price of platinum has risen from the wartime price of $35 per ounce to $56, an average increase of 60 percent. The Soviet Union is the largest producer of platinum, and its government representatives will only allow exports at an agreed price. South America and the United Kingdom are also suppliers of platinum.</p>
<h3>Excessive Surge; Longs Liquidate; China Shares Begin to Fall Yesterday; Foreign Shares Turn from Stable to Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, China shares were extremely active, reaching a boiling point. A certain bank vigorously purchased unpopular small shares, such as Xinya, Zhongfa, and Neiyi Shijie, and dealers deliberately hyped them up, causing the price of Zhongfa Neiyi to approach 300 yuan and the price of Xinya Pharmaceutical to jump by about 30% to 150 yuan compared to the previous day. However, due to the excessive surge, they were soon knocked down by longs in the industry, and the decline was rapid. As a result, popular shares lacked support and also declined. The market was weakest near noon. Compared to the previous Saturday, the yarn market was slightly down. Meiya Jingfu fell by half a percent, while Xinguang Qinxing fell but not by much. Among the unpopular shares, Zhongxing, Xinyong, and Rongfeng retreated, while Guan Cheng, Zhongfang, and Dachina fell slightly. Yuanlao shares remained stable.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were initially stable but then weakened. The longs had no intention of holding for long. Yisha opened in the morning, hovering around 12,800 yuan, but gradually weakened after opening. Yinglian and others also followed suit, with most at low prices near halftime. Compared to the previous close, Yisha, Yinglian, and Zhiyue fell by about 10%, while others fell but not by much.</p>
<h3>Continued Weakness in Coal Prices</h3>
<p>Hongji layer allocation price reduction; coke and cooked coal also fell</p>
<p>Transactions in the coal market were scarce, and market sentiment was weak, with a consistent bearish outlook. Only bituminous coal showed some activity. The highest price of coke and cooked coal had reached 500,000 to 600,000 yuan before, but due to the abundance of arrivals and sluggish actual sales, the price quickly fell back to 200,000 yuan and remained stable for quite some time. Now, it is also affected by the decline in white coal and is falling towards the 200,000 yuan mark. Furthermore, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the application from the coal ball manufacturing industry to reduce the allocation price of Hongji layer, the raw material for making coal balls. The price is lower than before, at 110,000 yuan per 10,000, delivered at the Pudong wharf coal depot.</p>
<h3>Fur Sales Booming in New York</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] Donglin Company recently sold Chinese fur goods here. The base price was slightly higher for a few, but most were the same as the market level. It is said that half of its inventory has now been sold. There is the most demand on the market for black and purple lamb skins. Of the 46,000 orders, 55 percent have already been sold at current prices, with the highest price being US$4 and the average price being US$3.75. Of the 4,000 lamb skin orders, 94 percent have also been sold, at prices between US$7.50 and US$8.50, with the highest price being US$9.75. Due to transportation capacity limitations, Zhejiang lambskins (11,500 sheets), Japanese otter skins (10,000 sheets), and 50% of the Chinese yellow wolf skins (43,300 sheets) have not been sold. The company also sold its inventory of 76,000 African Persian lambskins at a price 12.5% higher than in March, with the highest price being US$21.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Deliver Lumber to China Monthly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] General MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to deliver lumber produced in Japan to Shanghai and Qinhuangdao in China from now on. The import and export section of the Economic and Scientific Department claimed that 25,000 "stones" of lumber will be shipped to Qinhuangdao and 10,000 "stones" to Shanghai each month. The Japanese "stone" is equivalent to about 10 cubic feet.</p>
<h3>Global Wheat Production and Sales Situation; Demand Reaches 78.4 Million Bushels; Supply Only 48.3 Million</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] Regarding the shipment of wheat to protected areas, the government recently took two measures: First, the government will issue a uniform 25% allowance for wheat transported to granaries. Second, the limit price of Chicago wheat will be raised by 15 cents per bushel, plus the government will give a special bonus of 30 cents for wheat exported before May 25, for a total increase of 45 cents. The extent to which this measure will be implemented is not yet known.</p>
<p>Wheat occupies an important position in the world food relief plan. In 1945, half of the calories in the food of European countries were supplied by wheat, while the number for the United States was only a quarter. This shows the importance of wheat, and the shipment and export of grains are easier than those of meat and dairy products. The quantity needed to be imported by various regions in the first half of 1946 is estimated at approximately 73.2 million bushels, and with substitutes of rice, it requires a total of 21 million tons, for a total of 78.4 million bushels.</p>
<p>The wheat exported from surplus-producing countries is approximately 47 million bushels, and according to an estimate made by the US Agricultural Economics Bureau at the end of March, these countries may ship 37.5 million to 43.5 million bushels in the second half of the year. The estimated surplus grain (excluding rice) that can be utilized during this period from wheat-producing countries, namely the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia, totals 375-435 million bushels, and from countries producing corn, oats, and barley, namely the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries, totals 48 million bushels.</p>
<p>Regarding how the United States can achieve the export target of 22.5 million bushels, if the wheat used for feed and seeds from January to June can be reduced to 90 million tons, and the storage volume after July 1 can be reduced to 150 million bushels, then 440 million bushels can be obtained for domestic consumption and export. Domestic demand in the United States is approximately 250 million bushels, leaving less than 200 million bushels for export needs. Approximately 100 million bushels of wheat were shipped in the first three months of this year. Therefore, the problem currently facing the US government seems to be how to transfer wheat used for feed and domestic applications to make up for the additional need of 25 million bushels to achieve the export target of 22.5 million bushels. Even if successful in two months, the gap between the need of 78.4 million bushels and the supply of 48.3 million bushels still cannot be filled.</p>
<h3>Frequent Transactions in Silk Goods; Rayon Has Become Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of rayon showed signs of firmness and stability. The current price of 120-count Tianqiao bright silk was a minimum of 300,000 to 310,000 yuan and a maximum of 310,000 to 330,000 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was still priced at 300,000 yuan, the same as the previous day. There were transactions in miscellaneous brands, with prices around 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Factory silk with high uniformity was very stable, with asking prices similar to the previous two days. User silk was also quite firm and stable. The price of dried silk warp slightly increased by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, with 500,000 yuan for five piculs. Transactions in silk goods were frequent, and prices increased. Yesterday morning, the price of Meiya bed sheets was 1.38 million yuan, 80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of Dacheng plaid was 4,880 yuan, and it went beyond 5,000 yuan in the afternoon. Other goods from Shenghang also reported price increases.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Newspapers Arrive in Shanghai; Lumber, Kerosene, and Automobiles Also Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Montreux Chassis, managed by Ford Lines, arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening from Seattle via Little Luzon and Hong Kong, carrying 1,327 tons of lumber, 203 tons of newspapers, 45 tons of steel plates, 379 bales of garments, and 59 tons of bleaching powder, totaling approximately 4,000 tons. Unloading will begin today. The Shawdyale, managed by the US Steel Corporation, also arrived in Shanghai from the US, carrying 819 pieces of newspapers, 840 tons of kerosene, and approximately 1,000 automobiles. It was expected to arrive yesterday, but had not been imported as of late at night. It may have arrived at the Wusongkou and is waiting for a berth due to the lack of berths in the port.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Sentiment in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Since the buying trend of red and green tea from Tianjin, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places has been developing continuously, the trend has been very sharp. Recently, Fenhans have also come to inquire, so the market sentiment has been greatly stimulated, and the asking prices of holders are mostly optimistic. Taiwan black tea and Qimen tea cores have all hit new highs, and other teas have also shown their edge compared to before. As for the foreign-managed tea market, at present, it only relies on the preference of African and Moroccan regions for Zhenmei tea with good quality. Jardine Matheson is still discussing with the owners, while other countries are silent.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Tea Price Limit</h3>
<p>[Tianjin News] The Social Affairs Bureau of Tianjin has imposed a price limit on tea prices and has ordered the industry association to set prices and strictly prohibit unauthorized increases. The agreed prices are as follows: Huada Fang, Huaxiao Ye, and black tea, with a maximum price of 16,000 yuan and a minimum price of 1,600 yuan. Longjing Biluo, with a maximum price of 16,000 yuan and a minimum price of 3,300 yuan. Tea powder, with a maximum price of 9,600 yuan and a minimum price of 961 yuan. All prices are per 1,000 catties.</p>
<h3>Both Green and White Sugar Markets are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only Zhongsha white sugar was flat due to a large amount of spot goods, while other sugars were mostly firm. The current price of the association's distribution disk was initially 70,500 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreased to 70,250 to 70,000 yuan. Substandard goods were 68,000 yuan, then 68,750 to 68,500 yuan. Warehouse warrants were 68,000 to 68,500 yuan. In the afternoon, current goods were 70,000 yuan, company goods were 71,000 yuan, and the price of Quan Zhou white sugar was 68,000 yuan. Diaaoqing was 54,500 yuan, and the next grade was 52,000 to 3,000 yuan. Gao Gong powder was asking for 80,000 yuan, and Ti Zhuang Qing was asking for 62,000 yuan. Oil-cotton red was 75,000 yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Soap Factory Sales Increase; Asphalt Prices Rise</h3>
<p>As asphalt has become active in soap production, the market situation has gradually improved. The goods stored in this city have also been gradually cleared, totaling approximately 20,000 to 30,000 pieces. The opening price of Neiping oil from Youhang has increased from 46,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan, and the opening price of Shuanglian blue oil containing water has increased from 35,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan. Hangzhou has also been affected. Hanghang has sold Neiping oil for 47,000 yuan and Shuanglian blue oil for 40,000 yuan, both delivered in Hangzhou. Soap factory demand is now in season, and the situation may improve further. However, with prices at this level, Han asphalt is also worthwhile. If the Yangtze River transportation is smooth, Han asphalt can provide assistance, and the supply in Shanghai will not be lacking. Therefore, even if there is a price increase in the market, it will be limited. Dealers' selling prices have increased with the market, with current prices at 65,000 yuan for the current carload, 57,000 to 58,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 55,000 yuan for Duji, 52,000 yuan for Diqian oil, 46,000 to 47,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 44,000 yuan for Macheng oil.</p>

<h3>How to Enter Sipingjie and Changchun into the National Army's Control</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao, Shenyang Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 23rd</p>
<p>The National Army's capture of Sipingjie immediately lifted the stagnation in the Northeast. At the same time, this also marked the prelude to the National Army's entry into Changchun. This high-speed military development laid the groundwork for political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Starting from Sipingjie, one after another, Gongzhuling, Xi'an, Yitong, Liaoyuan, Fenghua (Zhishu), Guojiadian, and other large and small strongholds were successively abandoned by the Communist army and fell into the embrace of the National Army. This all indicates the inevitable fate of Changchun.</p>
<p>Sipingjie, after two months of occupation, had its outskirts constructed with layers of fortifications. Bunkers and trenches were interconnected, and even rails and steel plates were utilized. The number of stationed troops was also extremely large. The original plan was to defend it to the death, as the Communist army once regarded it as "Stalingrad."</p>
<p>After the National Army's northern route captured Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and other places, its northward advance fell into a state of stagnation. In addition to encountering many difficulties, it was also reorganizing and waiting for reinforcements to deal with the large force that the Communist army was said to have deployed in the front.</p>
<p>Since the late March, when the National Army advanced in three routes along the north and south of the Middle-East Railway and the Fushun line on the east side, the northern route pointing to Changchun was led by the Sun Corps, dressed in American-style uniforms. Deputy Army Commander Jia led this group of strong men, mostly born in the southeast, to advance. Tieling, Kaiyuan, and Changtu encountered many difficulties and hardships along the way. In addition, there were heartbreaking battles. In the end, they overcame the difficulties and achieved military victories.</p>
<p>The Liao Corps, responsible for the right wing, led by General Zong Xiang, was initially tasked with the arduous mission of receiving the area between Shenyang and Yingkou. As a result, in a difficult environment, they fought all the way to Yingkou by the sea. Now, they have been transferred to the northern route. The Chen Mingren Corps on the left wing is a new force. The cooperation of the three routes achieved this mission.</p>
<p>The various armies pressed toward Sipingjie. On the National Army's side, the order was given on the 14th. The Communist army initially planned to defend Sipingjie with the spirit of the Soviet army defending "Stalingrad." However, after only making contact with a few strongholds outside Sipingjie, their resolve wavered. Although reporters were unable to obtain information from the Communist army's side, it seemed that they realized that the National Army was determined to take it, that the flanking forces were advancing rapidly, and that their own situation was unfavorable. Knowing that the overall situation was lost, they made a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 19th, the Communist army rushed out its last batch of personnel from the northwest corner of Sipingjie. The National Army entered the city at dawn that day. Thus, the battle of Sipingjie, which was currently crucial to the victory or defeat of the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the Northeast, fortunately did not result in major bloodshed, and the lives and property of the people were not greatly sacrificed, ending the final act.</p>
<h3>City of Beans, Extremely Important Position</h3>
<p>Sipingjie is the capital of Liaobei Province and the seat of Sipingjie City. The Middle-East Railway runs through it from north to south. To the east is the Pingmei Railway—Sipingjie to Meihekou, and to the west is the Pingqi Railway—Sipingjie northwest to Qiqihar. These three main railway lines form a large intersection in Sipingjie. Reaching the coast to the south, connecting to the Soviet Union to the north, linking to Korea to the east, and connecting to Mongolia to the west, as a result, this place has been created into a colonization area with convenient transportation and an important strategic position.</p>
<p>The urban area is quite large, with a population of approximately 88,000 people. The establishment of the province and city has created the prosperity of Sipingjie, and commerce and industry are increasingly flourishing. As a result, the population has increased from 60,000 to the aforementioned number.</p>
<p>However, the main reasons for its prosperity are transportation and agricultural products. Sipingjie Province is located in the center of the fertile land of Liaobei. The yields of soybeans, sorghum, and corn are extremely abundant. Sipingjie City is a major distribution center, known as the "Eastern Mountain Granary Area." Also, because of the abundance of soybeans, it has the beautiful name of "City of Beans." In the future, it will also occupy an important position in international agricultural trade.</p>
<p>There are many coal mines and limestone mines near Sipingjie. In terms of industry, there are flour mills, oil presses, etc. Among them, there are more oil presses, so it also has the reputation of "Oil Chemical Industry."</p>
<p>Sipingjie City was originally divided into two districts, "Daoli" and "Dao wai," by the "Middle-East Railway" running vertically through it. The west is Daoli, and the east is Dao wai. Neither district has traces of war, and the stores are all open. The train station is an exception. New wounds and old scars are vividly visible. The overpass crossing the railway has also been destroyed. From the outside, Sipingjie does not have much trauma, but the damage suffered in spirit and material is very serious. Liu Lundong, Chairman of Liaobei Province, and Yang Zhusun, Mayor, arrived in Sipingjie on the 20th and announced that they would immediately start restoration work.</p>
<h3>Changchun's Vanguard, The Strategic Gongzhuling</h3>
<p>The various National Army troops actively advanced. On the 21st, the central route first used rapid troops to detour to the area north of Gongzhuling, and the main force rapidly advanced into Gongzhuling. The western route pressed toward Liaoyuan, and troops entered Yitong. Another force entered Xi'an from the southeast. According to investigations, the coal reserves in Xi'an are 500 million tons. The urban area has a large-scale thermal power plant. When the Communist army retreated, it planned to destroy it. Fortunately, there was not enough time, and workers obstructed it, so it is still intact. If it can be used well, the power generation is 120,000 kilowatts, which can solve the power shortage in parts of Shenyang.</p>
<p>Gongzhuling is the vanguard city of Changchun. It is located at the watershed of the Liao River Basin and the Songhua River Basin. To the north, it extends from Huaide to Tongyang, a winding range of ancient hills hundreds of kilometers long. It is strategically defensible in military terms. The puppet Manchukuo established it as a city in 1942. The urban area covers an area of 864 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 50,000 people. In terms of industry, there are oil presses, wineries, rice mills, and brick factories.</p>
<p>Our newspaper's special correspondent (the second person) returned from Changchun and photographed after meeting with CCP representatives, Shu Shishi (third from the right) and Wu (first from the right)</p>
<h3>Rushing Forward, Changchun Reappears in Dawn Light</h3>
<p>The Middle-East Railway runs vertically through the city center from north to south. To the north and south of the railway, a bridge about 86 meters long crosses the railway, connecting the commercial district and the old city area. The commercial district has many specialty products, while the old city area has many old-style residences. The "Gongzhuling National Agricultural Experiment Station" was quite well-known during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the Communist army lost Gongzhuling, Changchun immediately exposed the Sun Corps on the front. It rushed forward from Sipingjie. It reached Guojiadian on the 20th, Gongzhuling on the 21st, Fanjatun on the 22nd, and detoured to the left wing of Changchun on the 23rd. At this time, the troops of the Liao Corps, in a lightning-like manner, entered Changchun City at noon on the 23rd. The important area of Changchun thus fell into the arms of the National Army and was again under the jurisdiction of the central government.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rapid military changes between Sipingjie and Changchun did not result in very tragic bloodshed. More startling was that the Communist army blew up the railway bridges north and south of Sipingjie and burned the brick, stone, and wood bridges on the highway. To the south of Changchun, this was not possible due to time constraints.</p>
<p>When will the military actions in the Northeast unfold? When will political negotiations succeed? These are things that everyone cares about, and the people of the Northeast have a particularly personal pain. Fortunately, from various perspectives, the situation in the Northeast has already revealed the dawn of peace, or it may be the time of dawn!</p>
<h3>Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The Communist army in the Northeast has now been unified and organized. The so-called "Democratic Allied Army" of 300,000 is a mystery and is currently expanding continuously. In Changchun, we only saw the Eighth Route Army speaking Shandong dialect. Everywhere on the streets, we saw typewritten slogans of "Welcome to Join the Army" and "Army Enrollment Office" written on the walls.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Baozhong's announcement in a frank discussion with us on the evening of the 25th, the organization of the "Democratic Allied Army" has three parts: One is the Eighth Route Army, led by Peng Zhen; the second is the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," formerly known as the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army," led by Zhou Baozhong. Zhou claimed to have 150,000 to 200,000 people, an unspecified number; the third is the New Fourth Army and the old Northeast Army. The New Fourth Army has only a thousand people, led by Lin Biao. The Northeast Army is led by Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueliang, Wan Yi, and others. Lu Zhengcao announced that the number of Northeast Army troops under their command is now a full 100,000.</p>
<h3>Banquet of the Northeast Bureau</h3>
<p>The overall leadership organization is the "Democratic Allied Army General Headquarters," with Lin Biao as the Commander-in-Chief, and Lu Zhengcao, Zhou Baozhong, and Xiao Jingguang as the Deputy Commanders, and Peng Zhen and Luo Ronghuan as the Political Commissars. Zhou is the Commander of the Eastern Manchuria Army, and Lu is the Commander of the Western Manchuria Army. These forces can be said to have appeared in the Northeast completely after Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>As Zhang Xuesi told reporters, he left the pass in September last year, leading no more than 2,000 old Northeast Army soldiers, but now he has 25,000. This will be discussed separately in another section. Not to mention the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Zhou Baozhong particularly clarified that the Communist army only goes to places where the Soviet army does not go.</p>
<p>As for the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," according to Zhou Baozhong, its predecessor was the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. "The Anti-Japanese Allied Army was established in 1935." He said: "The Northeast People's Revolutionary Army and local guerrilla forces, after reorganization and unified command, formed eleven armies. Constantly fighting the Japanese army, starting in 1938, the Japanese army constantly 'suppressed' us. In the winter of that year and throughout 1939, the Allied Army suffered heavy losses. Villages related to the Anti-Japanese Allied Army were burned and killed. For example, in Fusong County, Dongman, 5,000 to 6,000 ginseng farmers (each with about ten people) were completely destroyed by the enemy. In the puppet Sanjiang Province and Mudanjiang Province, 800,000 houses were burned down. At this time, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army reached its most difficult period, living almost entirely in the ice and snow, mountains, and dense forests, and having to exchange blood and flesh for a meal. Allied Army generals Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, etc., died in battle between 1939 and 1941, while Xie Wendong and Li Huatang surrendered to the enemy."</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Allied Army can be said to have completely collapsed in 1941. Zhou Baozhong said that at this time, they could only "hide, carry out covert activities, and decentralized activities."</p>
<p>From then on, from 1941 to 1945, according to Zhou Baozhong, there were still several battles in the forests of Jidong, the Hinggan Mountains in eastern and western northern Manchuria during those five years. Zhou Baozhong used this to prove that the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army still existed. Zhou Baozhong himself is now in Changchun, talking to us. He is the Commander of the Fifth Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. His catchphrase is: "I fought the Japanese devils in the Northeast for fourteen years."</p>
<p>As for the situation after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, he said in another conversation: "The situation in Manchuria suddenly changed. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army turned to carry out extensive and active activities, vigorously expanding this patriotic force to respond to the Red Army, and launching a war behind enemy lines, and in the Soviet-occupied areas helped to maintain order, communicate Sino-Soviet friendship, and carry out democratic construction. Currently, the Allied Army in Dongman and Beiman alone has reached 150,000 people."</p>
<p>On the 25th, we were still not free. Zhou Baozhong came to our residence. Naturally, we talked from 8:00 PM, and after eating dinner, we continued to talk until 12:30 AM. We asked him why they wanted to attack Changchun. He replied:</p>
<p>"From February 4th to 9th, the National Army occupied Panshan and Taian. At this time, the CCP Central Committee agreed to the National Army taking over Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin after the Soviet army withdrew. The Communist army expanded 30 li on both sides of the railway, but the Northeast issue had to be resolved through consultation. The CCP Central Committee notified us that the three-person group might come to the Northeast before March 5th, but they did not come. In March, the Chinese army attacked Fushun, Yingkou, Anshan, and Benxi Lake again. From March 15th to 20th, the CCP Central Committee sent a telegram to each family saying: 'Peace is hopeless.' The National Army advanced north to Kaiyuan again. We were beaten everywhere. Changchun is very close to Jilin. The security team in Changchun was reorganized from the puppet army. They had fought against us in the past. I had been injured five times, all by this group of iron and stone troops. They were reorganized by the government. We were already dissatisfied. The puppet army can enter Changchun, but we, who fought the Japanese devils for fourteen years, are not qualified to enter Changchun? And their garrison is only 40 kilometers away from Jilin. In order to defend ourselves, we must take action. So I expressed my opinion to the Northeast Bureau and decided to attack Changchun."</p>
<p>On May 1st, the CCP Northeast Bureau came to Changchun, and we saw Peng Zhen, the Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, as well as Lu Zhengcao and Zhang Xuesi. According to Kaifeng, who told Shenzhi, Lin Biao is on the front line in Sipingjie.</p>
<p>As soon as the CCP Northeast Bureau arrived in Changchun, their attitude towards us completely changed.</p>
<p>Initially, Liu Juying, the new mayor of Changchun, invited us to eat at the Yamato Hotel on May 2nd. Liu Juying was in the position of the host, but he was silent, only Zhou Baozhong spoke. He told us at the meeting that eight of the nine provinces in the Northeast have democratically elected chairmen. He announced the list as follows:</p>
<p>Liaoning: Zhang Xuesi, Jilin: Zhou Baoping, Andong: Gao Chongmin, Nenjiang: Yu Yifu, Che Xiangchen (Deputy) Heilongjiang: Li Yanlu, Songjiang: Feng Zhongyun, Liaobei: Li Youwen (Deputy) Xing'an: None.</p>
<p>Among them are the elected chairmen or vice chairmen, but I don't know if they are willing to come, or if they are not in the Northeast, so he is unwilling to tell us.</p>
<p>On May 4th, the Northeast Bureau invited us to eat at the Northeast Hotel. The layout of this restaurant is not like the layout of businessmen, but a new layout of political workers. There are in the hallway, and Zhu De and Mao Zedong's portraits in the dining room, with Sun Yat-sen's portrait in the middle.</p>
<p>Peng Zhen is one of the CCP committee members from Yan'an. Lin Biao, Chen Yun, Luo Ronghuan, and Lu Zhengcao are also central committee members and members of the Northeast Bureau. Zhou Baozhong is not a central committee member, but he is also one of the members of the Northeast Bureau.</p>
<p>Peng Zhen is tall, a Shanxi native, with an aura of Yan and Zhao, a rosy complexion, and a strict political stance and gentle tone in his speech. He said:</p>
<p>"Among the nine provinces in the Northeast, eight provinces have provincial assemblies, except for the Mongolian part. Regarding Mongolia, we approve of their implementation of local autonomy, according to the principles of the first National Congress. Just like the United States, there are many dots on the national flag. These many dots are like various ethnic groups, so China can become a harmonious country."</p>
<p>In his reply to inquiries about the Mongolian issue, he said: "There are no communists among the Mongolians."</p>
<p>Regarding the Mongolian autonomy issue, the CCP has not learned the details, but Lu Zhengcao said: The leading figure in the autonomy movement is Boyan Mandu. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo era, he was the Governor of the puppet Xing'an South Province.</p>
<p>Shenzhi then asked: "Boyan Mandu was an official of the puppet government. He is now engaged in the autonomy movement. Then, according to the CCP's policy, is there anything inconsistent?"</p>
<p>Peng Zhen and Lu Zhengcao replied: "This depends on the meaning of the Mongolian people and has nothing to do with us. We cannot stop the Mongolian people from supporting him."</p>
<p>We also asked:</p>
<p>"How many of the nine provinces in the Northeast are currently under the control of the Communist army?"</p>
<p>At this time, Peng Zhen, Zhou Baozhong, Lu Zhengcao, and Kaifeng, who were present, calculated and prepared to answer this question. At first, everyone was quite straightforward, saying that all areas except those where the National Army is located are under the control of the Communist army. However, Lippmann insisted on asking how many tenths.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is difficult to calculate, we have never counted." Peng Zhen said, "It can be said that south to Yingkou, east to Fushun, west to Shanhaiguan, and north to south of Sipingjie are all National Army areas. In terms of population, our area accounts for 70 percent, and in terms of area, it accounts for 85 percent."</p>
<p>"Okay, excluding Mongolia." Zhou Baozhong added, "The area also accounts for 70 percent, two 70 percents."</p>
<p>However, when asked about the situation north of Qiqihar, they said they were not clear, and the Communist army had not yet gone to take over.</p>
<p>Shenzhi mentioned the issue of industrial construction in the Northeast and asked Peng Zhen what the CCP Northeast Bureau's research results were. He replied:</p>
<p>"The research results believe that if there is no obstacle, it can be fully restored to its original state in three years."</p>
<p>Albena asked: "Do you plan to use American aid?"</p>
<p>"This depends on the goals of the United States," Peng replied.</p>
<p>Shenzhi then asked: "So, what conditions are these three years of recovery based on?"</p>
<p>"Based on political conditions, as long as there is democracy and peace, three years will not be a problem."</p>
<p>Therefore, Shenzhi doubly asked if there were experts studying this issue. Peng Zhen said: "Several secretaries in our place are studying this issue."</p>
<p>"However, there is very little industrial destruction," Peng Zhen continued, "I went to Fushun to see, and only 20-30% was lost. The industrial equipment dismantled and transported by the Soviet Union was limited to military industry."</p>
<p>When we contacted CCP personnel, they were unwilling to provide any theoretical explanation on this issue, only saying that it was a controversial issue. The controversy is limited to theory, but we have never argued, and the facts are undeniable. Several of us have gone to Fushun to see, so Shenzhi said to Peng Zhen</p>
<p>"I have also seen Fushun. For example, the thermal power plant in Fushun is a power component. Naturally, the military industry also needs power, but 90% of the Qi Ro quantity was dismantled. Other losses in the oil refinery, liquefaction plant, and electric boiler are also huge. Even if we come to make theoretical arguments now, it will not help." Peng Zhen was silent.

<h3>The Cry of the Exiles (1)</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>We know that your newspaper has always upheld justice and can speak up for the people. Therefore, we timidly wrote an article, hoping that you would publish it in your esteemed newspaper immediately so that we may gain sympathy from society and receive some much-needed assistance. We are truly pitiful and miserable! Respectfully, the Wandering People of Fudan University.</p>
<p>I am from a village in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai – and can also be considered a member of this large group of exiled youths. I have my own home, my own fields, gray-haired parents, a wife who follows me, and children who play around my knees – everything that is dear and beloved. Yet, yet (I want to use a hundred "yets"), what is it now? My home has been occupied and divided by a group of "democratic" "believers" who "take the property of others as their own"! My village? It has "changed color" and is now under the rule of another "imperial power"! My fields? They have been forcibly seized! My garden? It is desolate! My father? He lives in constant anxiety and holds his breath! My mother? She cries all the time! My wife? She suffers the same fate as me, being imprisoned, coerced, and threatened! My children? They are fostered or working as servants! Everything that is dear and beloved? It is over, destroyed! I have not committed any crimes, I have not been a traitor, but I do not know why I have to suffer such cruel, miserable, barbaric, and despicable... punishment? Did we commit some sin in our previous lives? However, that is "idealistic," and we should now be talking about "materialism," so this answer seems somewhat incorrect. Someone told me: you yourself have not committed any crimes, but your property has. But I also think that my property is based on the rights that the law grants me. This right is not only held by me alone, and I did not obtain it through cunning or deception; it is the reward I deserve for my labor. So this answer is also questionable. Someone else told me: "It's because you are not a believer in the 'New Democracy' 'bible,' otherwise you would never be exiled and lose everything. Not only would you not be exiled or plundered, but you could also share some of 'other people's property as' your 'own property.'" I vaguely understand this answer because I have not studied the history of the Russian Revolution, so I am not clear about this principle. However, I think I am not a red-haired, green-eyed foreigner, so why are some people determined to bring foreign goods to China and make us innocent youths suffer? But why I have to suffer this kind of punishment, I still don't understand.</p>
<p>Although this is my personal experience, there is no need to shout loudly and waste my breath. However, I believe that there is definitely more than one person who has the same experience as me, and there are quite a few of them. If you don't believe me, please take a look at this large group here who want to ask you to appeal to the government authorities and make the following appeal to the reasonable and intelligent compatriots in China:</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has been won, and the enemy has been driven away. Everyone in every corner of China is clear about this, and even the traitors who echoed the enemy cannot deny it. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, do we need to kill each other? Do we need to fight this city today and that city tomorrow, causing the people to suffer from eight years of war? Is that not enough? Should we suffer even more cruel massacres? This group of rogue soldiers who are like devils say that "to obtain the truth, we must struggle," and handing over the world to you is "the truth," right? Satisfying your desire to kill is "the truth," right? Now let me first talk about the situation in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai – and then talk about my request for appeal and appeal:</p>
<p>(1) Warlords occupying territory – During the War of Resistance, China was divided into three parts. Now that victory has been won, the Japanese devils have collapsed, and the accompanying ugly creatures have also scattered. There are still two parts left. One is the so-called "recovered area," and the other is the so-called "liberated area." I am not clear about the situation in the "recovered area" and other "liberated areas." What I know is the situation in the "Southeastern Region" is like this: although the enemy has fled, it seems like it is still on the eve of a great war. Young and strong men have to join the army, starting from the most hardworking militia and gradually rising to the district team, the regiment, and the main force. They only want to confront the central government and govern themselves.</p>
<p>(2) Blocking materials – During the War of Resistance, it was absolutely necessary to block materials in order to reduce the enemy's supplies. But now, the war has ended, and overall victory has been achieved, but our "Southeastern Region" is still in a wartime state no less than when we were fighting the enemy. Without the permission of the local "government," all food, cotton, and other local products are not allowed to be exported. If you resist, you will be fined and confiscated, "taken to the official's office," and there are many tricks. All the big and small merchants are crying out in pain – no, that's not right. It should be said that all the big and small merchants are "rejoicing," celebrating that we have won, "liberated," and "democratized"!</p>
<p>(3) Numbing the youth – It doesn't matter if you are a middle school student, elementary school student, or are currently a student, or were a student in the past. In short, as long as you have some knowledge, or are preparing to have some knowledge, you have the "qualification" and "right" to be forced to read newspapers and books such as "Xinhua Daily," "Jianghai Daobao," and "New Outlook on Life," until your brain is indeed dyed red to the point of turning black. If you are indeed stubborn and unyielding, then you are guaranteed to wear the most fashionable top hat called "reactionary," and then you are in danger. There are militia elders monitoring you at any time, and you are also at risk of being detained and killed at any time.</p>
<p>(4) Forcibly demanding public grain – Paying taxes is the duty of the people, but "relatives and friends should not owe debts." If you owe debts, be prepared to eat hemp rope. Rent has been reduced, reduced by 25%, but you still have to give discounts to show "big discounts." What kind of discounts? It depends, 60% or 70% are available, and 40% or 50% are also available. Therefore, the general middle class and above cannot express their suffering. If you say you are suffering, you are "reactionary" and "look down on the government."</p>
<p>(5) Compelling the use of Communist currency – In our "liberated area," central government currency is not allowed to be used. It is said that this is "reactionary" currency, and the liberated area should use "democratic" currency. What happens if you use it? To be polite, it is confiscated, but not destroyed. Destroying it is still money after all, which is a pity. It is the common people and merchants who are not allowed to use it, but not the militia officials. Why? The reason is that the citizens of our great Republic of China have always been "only allowing officials to set fires, but not allowing the common people to light lamps." Don't forget this! So what kind of currency can be used without breaking the law? There are many types, and the illiterate folks are really confused. There are local currencies from the "Southeastern Region," "Jianghuai Bank notes," "Zhejiang East Bank notes," and "Central China Bank notes." It's a pity that our common people don't have guns and banknote printing machines, otherwise it would be a way to make money!</p>
<p>(6) Arbitrarily assigning donations – You are sitting at home, and militia elders, the "directors" and "comrades" of the Agricultural Resistance Association and the Return Resistance Association often come to your home to extort you. They want money, food, clothes, pants, shoes, mosquito nets, bedsheets, anything is fine, especially when it is the season, you are simply so busy that you have to deal with them. Sometimes it is said to be for comforting "local officials," and sometimes it is said to be for comforting "soldiers at the front." Moreover, the tax office is full of malpractices. Some people collect money without issuing receipts, and some people report less than the actual amount of goods. They offer some cigarettes, and everyone shares the profits, but no one can say it out loud.</p>
<p>(7) Violating public opinion – Since they advocate "democracy," they have to do some "democratic" gestures. When there are criminals, they have to hold public trials and small group discussions at night, which is considered to be soliciting public opinion, but the opinions are still predetermined by the brains of a few ruling classes. Can you object? Of course you can, not objecting is not "democratic," but please be careful afterward, you have been noticed by the authorities. Or before the meeting, the "democratic" "comrades" have already been ambushed, and they all pass the resolutions quickly, probably because they deeply know the psychology that "the masses are blind."</p>
<p>(8) Trampling on human rights – Autocracy is against the times, so democracy is catering to the times. However, the democracy that we, the people, demand, whether it is "new" or "old," is the real one, not the fake one. If there is only the beautiful name of democracy, but the actual practice is even worse than autocracy, then we, the people, simply find this kind of democracy somewhat hateful, frightening, pitiful, and detestable. In the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu, what we generally hear is the sound of democracy, but what we encounter is the reality of autocracy. The people cannot talk about freedom of belief, residence, speech, and publication, and even the security of life and property is not guaranteed. As long as you do not associate with or appease the believers of democracy, you will be monitored or assassinated everywhere, and your property will be divided and occupied by others at any time. This kind of democracy, which promotes sheep's head but sells dog meat, is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>In short, in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai, 99.5% of the people are all eating Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread) like a mute, unable to express their suffering. Only the remaining 0.5% of the comrades are singing aloud, loudly playing the triumphal song of their wealth-making methods.</p>
<p>If we talk about the recent situation, it is heartbreaking. Merchants are affected by the blockade of materials, and local products cannot be transported out, foreign goods cannot be transported in, and currency cannot circulate. Now they have to pay business tax and be subject to the control of public stores and cooperatives, unable to trade freely. Farmers, in addition to the militia, also have to pay public grain, not getting any real benefits. The hope and enthusiasm for a day of "getting ahead" and "ascending to heaven" has also cooled down. Workers are subject to the supervision of foremen, and 10% of the wages they earn with their own efforts are taken away as commissions for the foremen. If they don't flatter the foremen, they won't be assigned work. Scholars are the most miserable. They hate their ancestors, wondering why they spent money to let them study, causing them to be dragged around by others, unable to move at all. Because they know a few big words, they are wrongly killed, and no one knows how many.</p>
<p>The above is a very brief report. Now I want to talk about my three opening points:</p>
<p>(1) A request to you, sir – We know that you, sir, are the mouthpiece of the people. We hope that you can help us, this group of exiled youths, to suggest a good way to the government to resettle us and to find ways to rescue us from social figures. We are already a group of homeless and pitiful people! We are already a group of people wandering around without a home! We, more than thirty people, are about to starve to death! Sir, please save us!</p>
<p>(2) An accusation to the government – The officials in the central government: you are high above, do you still know the suffering of the people? Do you still know that large numbers of young people are leaving their villages and fleeing to the cities? I think you must have heard of this. But why have you always remained silent and not had an appropriate way to protect and arrange for us? What are you busy with every day? The suffering of the people is not alleviated, and you are just pretending to be deaf and dumb. Do you feel ashamed in your conscience? We, these more than thirty people, were all gathered unintentionally from various villages and towns who fled to the counties and cities because they could not bear the oppression of "democracy." But now the counties and cities have fallen again and have been occupied by the Communist army, so we have to flee to the south of the Yangtze River. We are already a group of people who cannot return to our hometowns and cannot see our parents! There are houses of various heights, and there are good and bad things to eat, but these all belong to other people, and we cannot "share" them casually. The few coins we carried in our rush to escape are about to run out, and we will starve to death if we don't die of anger! The big officials of the government, please save us! I hope you will truly act like an "official" and "leader," stand up straight, shoulder the responsibility, and don't fail the important task entrusted to you by the country and the earnest expectations of the people!</p>
<p>(3) An appeal to society – Fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts: now you are living a comfortable and leisurely life of peace and prosperity, but have you heard of the life in another world lived by the descendants of the Yellow Emperor who are the same as you, a completely different life? We are about to not have enough food to eat and not have enough clothes to wear! Why? Because we are living a life of escape! Why do we have to escape? Do you know what is called the "Three Capitals Movement"? The so-called three capitals are "capital," "knowledge," and "reputation." These three types of people are the three types of people who are oppressed in the "liberated area." Now the government under the leadership of "New Democracy" has launched an attack on these three types of people! Therefore, these three types of people are fleeing one after another. After all, having a knife placed on your neck is scary! We have fled, but how do we get by? Dear compatriots! Don't think that you are now living in peace and prosperity. I believe that perhaps one day this knife will also be placed on you. Please be vigilant and aware. We hope that you will respond to us and provide relief.</p>
<p>Finally, we have an opinion for all the exiled youths: We are all unfortunate people in the world. We fully expected that after the victory, we would still be living a life of escape that was even worse than when the enemy and puppets were invading. We also never thought that in the 20th century, the barbaric autocratic politics of Qin Shi Huang burning books and burying scholars would reappear in the civilized world! We also never thought that the "anti-enemy people" who taught us to sing the three songs of exile would turn their faces and tell us to go into exile! After thinking about it, we think that such scattered escape will make us suffer for the rest of our lives and never be able to return to our hometowns. We want to "fight back to our hometown"! We must unite and organize ourselves, and then ask the government to protect and resettle us, and ask society to provide us with relief and assistance. Only in this way can we have strength.

<h3>On Social Organization (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—傅统先 (Fu Tongxian)</p>
<p>Society is organized by the people, but society is not just a union or sum of the people. Here, the society we are talking about is a broad sense, it refers to any group organized by individuals, such as literary research associations, football teams, youth associations, Red Cross, political parties, governments, etc. What this article wants to explain is that social groups like this are a kind of organized association between individuals, and not a sum of many individuals mechanically pieced together.</p>
<p>The relationship between the individual and society is a question that has not been settled in sociology. Some people argue that society is just an empty name, and only the individual is real. Society has nothing other than the individual. Others argue that only society is real. The individual cannot exist without society. The individual in society is equal to a part of the whole. In fact, both of these statements are partially correct, but neither is completely correct. We argue on the one hand that the individual is a necessary condition for society, and on the other hand that society is a supra-personal entity. We say that the individual is a necessary condition for society, which means that if there were no individuals, then there would be no society. However, simply having many individuals does not constitute a society. Suppose there are many people in the same room, some are reading, some are reading newspapers, some are talking, some are playing ball, and these many individuals who "go their own way" are united together does not equal a group. We say that society is a supra-personal entity, which means that although society is organized and successful by individuals, society is above the individual. It has its own characteristics of existence, and is not equal to the sum of many personalities. For example, water is successfully organized by H2 and O, but the characteristics of water are not equal to the characteristics of H2 and the characteristics of O. Another example is that a house is built by many wooden boards, bricks, tiles, mud, and ash. But we cannot say: "A house is the sum of several wooden boards, tiles, mud, and ash." The reason why a house is a house is because it exceeds its organizational factors and has its own characteristics.</p>
<p>Now we further ask what are the supra-personal characteristics of society? The simple answer is that the reason why society becomes what it is is because there is only one goal, only one organization system, and only one leadership organization among many individuals. In a social organization, there can only be one general goal shared by many individuals. A literary research association can be established because many individuals want to jointly study literature. If in the same place, some people are reciting poetry, some are propagating political views, and some are in love, we cannot say that this is a literary research association. Under the same social organization, the individual has a universal will that surpasses his own will. The universal will is neither a mysterious force nor the sum of many individual wills. The so-called sum of individual wills is to add up the individual wills of Zhang San who wants to study literature, Li Si who wants to propagate political views, Zhao who wants to fall in love with Ms. Qian. The universal will is the will that all individuals have in common. Zhang San wants to study literature, Li Si, Zhao Da, and Qian Er all want to study literature, and this forms the universal will. This universal will is not unique to any one of them, but is common to them. So although it is not separated from the individual, it transcends the individual.</p>
<p>Since society is built on the same goal, then it can only have one organization system. The so-called organization system is a tool for carrying out work to achieve goals. The effectiveness of this tool is that it can use the most flexible and economical way to fully realize the goal. This organization can only belong to one system. If there are two different goals, then there will inevitably be two different administrative organization systems. But under the same goal, if there are two different organization systems at the same time, the result is either destroying this common goal or reducing the effectiveness of achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The leader of society is one or a few prophets and seers. They see this common goal clearly, grasp the power of the masses, and promote the most effective administrative mechanism in order to fully achieve this goal. He is an organizer, a promoter, and at the same time a person who satisfies the needs of the public. The leader is the representative of the masses. He represents the masses to express their wishes; he represents the masses to fight for their goals. Society has only one goal, so it can only have one leader. One leader does not refer to the dictatorship of one person. One leader refers to a small core group of prophets and seers who are integrated and bear the responsibility of leading the masses. If there are two leading organizations, then conflicts are prone to occur between them. As a result, not only do the masses not benefit, but they are at a loss as to what to do, where to go, and even be exploited to the point where their lives are ruined and the people are in dire straits.

<h3>A Brief Review of the Victory Exhibition of the Shanghai Artists Association</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chang</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Artists Association, it immediately began preparations for its first exhibition in celebration of victory. After a month of preparation, it was held simultaneously from May 31st to June 6th at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association as the east venue and the China Painting Garden as the west venue. The exhibits included six or seven hundred pieces of calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, Western painting, seal engraving, and photography, with over two hundred and fifty participating artists. It brought together Chinese and Western art under one roof, creating a magnificent spectacle, an unprecedented event in the Shanghai art world since the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, visitors flocked to see it in large numbers every day.</p>
<p>There were not many photography exhibits. Lang Jingshan's "Yellow Mountain Clouds and Mist" was still the most outstanding. Ao Sihong's photographs also possessed unique insights. There were few seal engraving exhibits. Tao Shoubo's were vigorous and classic, and Fang Jiekans's were even and profound, naturally standing out among them. There were very few sculptures, with no particularly eye-catching works. This field still needs development. This is probably due to the social environment, making development difficult in the short term. Western paintings were generally divided into oil paintings and watercolors. In oil paintings, Zhang Chongren's large hospital painting was the most striking. With beautiful colors and accurate human figures, it was a rare work in the modern Western painting world. However, the overall composition lacked unity and seemed somewhat scattered, and the emotional aspect felt too bland, lacking a sense of tension. Ran Xi's watercolors were skilled in depicting morning mists and evening glows, with vigorous brushstrokes and a seamless integration of sunlight and water. He was able to express extremely complex objects with extremely simple strokes, making him a masterpiece in watercolor. Western paintings were displayed in the China Painting Garden, where the direction of the easels was originally suitable for Chinese paintings but not very suitable for Western paintings. Therefore, the light entered from the side, either too dazzling to look at or too dark to see anything. The exhibitors should pay attention to lighting and not just focus on saving effort. In terms of painting style, the absence of Ji Weng's participation resulted in a lack of powerful works, which somewhat detracted from the exhibition. Wang Fuchang had more than enough purity but lacked boldness. Ma Gongyu excelled in elegance but lacked unrestrainedness. Only Feng Wenfeng's powerful brushstrokes could be considered outstanding.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese paintings were the most numerous exhibits and the mainstay of the exhibition. Among them, there were many masterpieces, but it is a pity that they cannot all be listed. Based on what was seen, here is a brief description of the most impressive works. In recent years, the trend of painting fish has been quite popular. Wang Shizi excels in brilliance; Liu Shi excels in beauty; and Wang Yachen excels in [blank space]. Each is able to establish their own style and compete in the realm of fish. There were also several painters of lions and tigers. Since Zhang Shanzi's death, his influence has not been seen. Xiong Songquan, though old, is still vigorous and must be regarded as the leading figure in this field. In terms of flowers and birds, there seemed to be few moving works, and there were also few remarkable figures. However, there were many painters of women, such as Wu Qingxia and Zhou Lianxia, who were both meticulous and glamorous but lacked character. Li Qiujun used little ink but was full of classic charm. Landscapes were the highlight of the traditional Chinese paintings. Zhang Bihan imitated Huang Gongwang, with a close resemblance in spirit and a tranquil atmosphere that reached perfection. Wu Zhenping imitated the ancients, placing alienation within the rules, with a pure and ancient air. He can be compared with Bihan. The works imitating the ancients can be considered the best of the best. Yu Jianwu has traveled all over the world, capturing famous mountains and rivers in his art. During the Anti-Japanese War, he also traveled to famous scenic spots in the southeast and recently returned to Shanghai. He will soon hold a solo exhibition of sketches of famous mountains. This time, he exhibited four works, all meticulously elegant, showing his true self, and his boldness and vigor could not be concealed. Is this not what is meant by "a hundred refined steel transformed into a gentle touch"? Zheng Wuchang's autumn mountain painting incorporated the methods of Shi Tao, Mei Qing, Qu Jushan, and Fei Danxu, using only dry ink and heavy colors, and can be considered a masterpiece. However, his two reed and willow paintings are rather thin, lacking a thick and lush charm, and are far from comparable to the autumn mountain painting. Zan Tianjian's large green and blue painting is brightly colored and eye-catching, created to celebrate victory, timely and in accordance with the occasion, with historical significance. Such a masterpiece may not be easily obtained by He [last name]. Feng Chaoran's ink painting is scattered and lacks spirit. It is said that he is too old and weak to paint. Wu Daiqiu's green and blue painting, although without the usual problem of repetition, is also somewhat empty and sparse. In addition, Wu Zhongxiong, Bei Xintai, Gu Kunbo, and others usually produce extremely exquisite works, but the works exhibited this time did not seem to be carefully chosen, which inevitably disappointed viewers. There were many immature works in the exhibition, and the review process seemed too lenient. It is hoped that this point will be improved in the second exhibition.</p>
<h3>Remaining Spring (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qun</p>
<p>"Don't be jealous! I pity him, I don't love him, rest assured!" She leaned tightly against his chest and smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>A happy white-clad figure whispered and laughed in the corridor. Jian Guang could hear it clearly in bed. "Not love, but pity!" He sighed sadly, reached for the electric bell at the head of the bed, and asked the room attendant to move the pot of small red flowers on the tea table out. The room attendant asked strangely:</p>
<p>"It was just bought yesterday, and it has bloomed such a beautiful flower. Why do you want to move it out?" "I don't like the color red, I'm afraid of seeing red!"</p>
<p>The room attendant laughed strangely: "Then where should I move it to?"</p>
<p>"Anywhere, throw it away, give it away, take it yourself, anyway, I don't want it!"</p>
<p>"How about giving it to a female patient next door?" the room attendant asked.</p>
<p>"Okay, I already said anywhere you want."</p>
<p>As the room attendant carried the flowerpot out, the small red flower flickered in front of Jian Guang again. Only then did he see clearly that it was a red rose, small, but very beautiful.</p>
<p>A misty drizzle sprinkled on the glass window, drip-drop...</p>
<p>Xiuzhen was awakened by a slight sound of rain.</p>
<p>She turned over, touched her sweaty chest, and felt a chill all over her body: cold sweat, cold hands, cold feet, cold body, cold bedding.</p>
<p>And her heart also turned cold with worry!</p>
<p>The quiet ward, the quiet sound of rain, the bed sheets were white, the tablecloth on the tea table was white, the curtains on the window were white... everywhere was white, the white of death, with no other colors to break through this deathly white, especially red.</p>
<p>She knew she had had another dream, an empty dream, a vague dream, but so lovely! She wanted to grasp it!</p>
<p>Grasp it! She savored the dream!</p>
<p>In the dream, it was spring! Not a misty spring, but a glorious spring with sunshine.</p>
<p>She stood by the river, the riverbank was full of flowers, the water was green, the flowers were red. In the interplay of red and green, she saw a small white sail, swaying back and forth in the river.</p>
<p>A song came, and someone on the small sail was singing:</p>
<p>"Beautiful aunt!</p>
<p>Your eyes are like pearls,</p>
<p>Your lips are like gems,</p>
<p>Your slender waist,</p>
<p>Like an infinitely soft ribbon,</p>
<p>I ask to forever hold you tightly in my heart!</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>What a familiar voice! Who is singing?</p>
<p>The song grew closer, the small sail grew closer, and she saw clearly: it was him!</p>
<p>Him! -</p>
<p>Pure white clothes, a pure white square face, young, handsome, like a noble and dignified lily, standing quietly in the center of the small sail, smiling at her.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded, her face burned, and timidly, softly, she called out: "Doctor He!"</p>
<p>Doctor He waved to her.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she asked shyly.</p>
<p>"Come here! You are mine, I love you!" Doctor He said softly.</p>
<p>She was so ashamed that her whole body was burning, but a gust of wind passed, and she was already in Doctor He's small sail.</p>
<p>The small sail was very narrow, and he leaned close to her body, like a ball of fire. She felt herself gradually melting, melting, melting so much that she couldn't tell where she was and where he was. …</p>
<p>The small sail drifted away, everywhere there were red flowers, green trees, blue sky, sunshine, … fragrant, passionate, … her and his spring, … she was so happy, she laughed ecstatically, but she woke up!</p>
<p>Woke up, and everything was gone! Only a deathly still ward, only a patch of dead white…</p>
<p>"Grasp it! Grasp it!" Xiuzhen still wanted to savor, still wanted to grasp that dream, but a violent "cough cough cough cough..." turned her face ashen, and cold sweat dripped down...</p>
<p>Lung disease - an ice arrow pierced her fragile heart!</p>
<p>Red flowers, green water, blue sky, sunshine, ... fragrant spring, happy spring, ... disappeared! Erased by a violent bout of coughing!</p>
<p>But she still wanted to struggle! She reached for the electric bell at the head of the bed, she wanted to call the room attendant and order him: "I'm coughing so badly, please go and get Doctor He for me!"</p>
<p>But her hand suddenly retracted. She heard a slight sound of footsteps in the corridor outside, first heavy, rhythmic rubber-soled shoes, then slow, hesitant high-heeled shoes walking on tiptoes. After the two sounds stopped at one spot, a low, quick laugh rang out:</p>
<p>"Darling Darling! Why do you still want to see that guy?"</p>
<p>"Don't be jealous! I pity him, I don't love him, rest assured!"</p>
<p>"Then I must also ask you not to be jealous!"</p>
<p>"What? ..."</p>
<p>"What pretense! Haven't you always been wary of that beautiful female patient? Let me tell you, I'm so afraid her lung disease will get worse day by day, even if it were a celestial maiden descending, I wouldn't dare to get near her! You can set your mind at ease!"</p>
<p>The conversation was not finished, the laughter was not finished. But Xiuzhen couldn't listen anymore!</p>
<p>Pressing her aching chest, cold sweat and cold tears dripped onto the pillow at the same time.</p>
<p>"Spring is theirs! Spring has no part with me!" Sadly, desperately, she sobbed. She didn't want to see that patch of deathly white, she closed her eyes, sobbing so hard that her whole body trembled.</p>
<p>She cried too sadly. Someone gently turned open her door, she didn't know. Someone walked up to her bed, she didn't know. It wasn't until someone softly called "Miss Wang" that she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, she was so surprised that she almost cried out. A small, bright red rose appeared before her! An old room attendant smiled at her with a wide mouth.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" She wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and asked strangely.</p>
<p>"Miss Wang! Why are you sad? Look! Mr. Shen next door sent you such a beautiful pot of flowers!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Shen next door?" Her heart began to beat a little.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Shen has the same disease as you. And like you, he is often sad. Just now, when he asked me to move this pot of flowers out, his face was also full of tears..."</p>
<p>The room attendant chattered on, but Xiuzhen was lost in thought. She suddenly asked: "How old is Mr. Shen? Is he handsome?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Shen is very young, at most twenty-five years old. Very handsome! It's just a pity that he's sick!"</p>
<p>The room attendant went out. Xiuzhen stared at the red flower. She suspected that she was dreaming again and tried her best to open her eyes wide, to open them wide. …</p>
<p>Not a dream! Indeed, there was a bright red flower in her deathly still room!</p>
<p>Gradually, tears flowed from the corners of her eyes again. But these were not tears of despair and pain, but tears of joy and realization.</p>
<p>After taking her medicine and drinking her milk, she tried her best to support herself and took out a piece of letter paper printed with honey-yellow delicate patterns from a drawer in a small table by the bed. She lay on the pillow and wrote these few sentences:</p>
<p>"Mr. Shen:</p>
<p>Thank you for giving me this red rose! It's so beautiful! It brought back the spring I lost and gave me a new life! But I still don't know your name, can you tell me? Wang Xiuzhen."</p>
<p>She folded the letter paper with excited trembling fingers, handed it to the room attendant to send it to the next door, and waited for a reply with excited trembling feelings.</p>
<p>The reply came indeed. It was a light blue Western-style envelope, inside was a light blue letterhead, on which was written:</p>
<p>"Miss Xiuzhen:</p>
<p>You thank me, but I want to thank God! Don't laugh at me, I'm kissing your letterhead. Because those honey-yellow little flowers on your letterhead are exactly what I wanted to find." My spring is back, and my life is back! Now I tell you, my name is Jian Guang, I hope you don't forget...</p>
<p>A year passed</p>
<p>Still a happy spring, the spring of young people.</p>
<p>Fragrant, passionate, everywhere there is light, everywhere there is fragrance, everywhere there is sweet singing and the soaring of wedding marches. …</p>
<p>The beautiful Miss Li Ying and the handsome Doctor He got married!</p>
<p>In the hall of a large hotel. The bride wore a silver dress, and the groom wore a scarlet carnation. Surrounded by flowers, they held hands, smiling proudly, smiling mysteriously, forgetting everything! … But, –</p>
<p>In the same spring, on a lonely wasteland in the suburbs, two new white stone graves were added. In front of one grave was a red rose, and in front of one grave was a honey-yellow canna. Although no one appreciated them, they were blooming quietly.</p>

<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Hearing news about you from afar, my heart is always filled with a restlessness, a worry. Fragile nerves keep conjuring up ominous premonitions. It seems I hear someone groaning for life, someone laughing wildly and ferociously.</p>
<p>I wish I lived in the enemy's country, filled with combat, filled with vitality, and how could I want to live a quiet life like a monk in the deep mountains? But, those clumsy, despicable sword skills, I'm almost too lazy to parry anymore. I never want these despicable people to be my friends, but these people seem to lack something even as enemies, lacking some of life's treasures – integrity and uprightness.</p>
<p>I love life, I hate life. As you said, "Being human is difficult." I want to add one more meaning: It is easy to be a floating, sinking person; it is very difficult to be a person who controls oneself.</p>
<p>It is far more difficult to walk on a broad road than to walk on a narrow, winding path. I'm not afraid of ridicule, I'm not afraid of loneliness. The road is so long, I fear I will always stop in my tracks. I want to rest tiredly.</p>
<p>Do you want to laugh at me? Scold me? Anyway, as you wish, you probably know these tastes too. Remember, in the past, when someone said, "They want to do that," we immediately replied, "We must do this." Tell me, is it still so firm now? I hope you are still so young and answer loudly: "Yes."</p>

<h3>Double Flying (48)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>The day after Mrs. Mo left, Baoling went to the medicinal herb shop. To show that he was a man of ambition, even though Mo Sheng told him that Mrs. Mo had left him a way out, that the house had not been sold, and advised him not to leave home for the time being and to wait until the house was rented out, he insisted on not doing so. He was grateful for Mrs. Mo's thoughtfulness, but this gratitude could not offset his melancholy. He was determined to live independently from now on. He thought that now was the time for him to truly start walking, and no matter how bumpy the road was, he had to take this first step steadily and upright! He was not afraid of falling, and if he fell, he would get up and walk again. In short, he was determined to walk on, fearless of dangers and difficulties, until he was old and dead. He did not intend to rest, nor did he want anyone to help him!</p>
<p>The name of this medicinal herb shop was Huichuntang. The owner, Liao Dafu, was from Sichuan and knew a little about medicine. In his early years, he specialized in purchasing medicinal herbs in the Sichuan-Yunnan area and selling them to various parts of Hubei. Gradually, he earned some money and opened a medicinal herb shop in Jingzhou. His luck wasn't bad, and in a dozen years, he had expanded from one shop to three. The medicinal herbs were complete, and the goods were genuine and authentic, making it one of the leading medicinal herb shops in Jingzhou. Since Liao Dafu went to Sichuan six years ago to purchase medicinal herbs, he happened to find that his first wife had died in his hometown. So he took his six-year-old son and left his hometown, never to return. Because his son needed someone to raise him, he remarried in Jingzhou to the daughter of a butcher. Perhaps because she had seen too much slaughtering, this butcher's daughter took bleeding as commonplace as urinating! Her temperament was inevitably influenced by the executioner, as if cruelty was instinct! She had a face full of horizontal flesh and was as fat as a pig, a pig waiting to be slaughtered! Liao Dafu, on the other hand, was a kind man. On the contrary, perhaps he had been in the business of medicinal herbs for too long, and he took saving people as important as eating his own meals! In addition, he had been influenced by a little medicine, and kindness was his nature! Although he owned a large number of medicinal herbs and also knew a little medicine, he was as thin as a sick man, a sick man who had been with the pharmacy for many years! In fact, he was stronger than anyone! A man in his forties, running a hundred or so miles a day was nothing to him.</p>
<p>After the proprietress married Liao Dafu, she gave birth to a fat boy in the second year. Now he was five years old. Liao Dafu named his eldest son Liao Dong and his second son Liao Liang, meaning that his two sons were the pillars of his family.</p>
<p>Liao Dong was already twelve years old, and fortunately, he had not been slaughtered by his butcher-type stepmother. Although he had inevitably suffered some physical hardship, he had not reached the point of bleeding. There were occasionally a few purple whip marks on his back. Liao Dafu had authentic Yunnan "Baiyao," and applying a bottle of it would relieve pain and reduce swelling. In order to reduce the chances of friction between his wife and son, Liao Dafu sent Liao Dong to school. Now Liao Dong had graduated from elementary school. According to the proprietress, she would not let him continue, because going to school cost money, and he could stay in the shop to keep accounts. Coincidentally, the bookkeeper had left a few days ago, so this would save the expense of hiring a bookkeeper. But Liao Dafu disagreed. Liao Dafu decided to nurture Liao Dong until he graduated from middle school, and then he would let him take over his shop management. It seemed too early to let him keep accounts at the moment. So Liao Dong had to continue studying, and Liao Dafu hired Baoling to be the bookkeeper. Although the proprietress was not happy in her heart, there was nothing she could do.</p>

<h3>Save Our Suffering Compatriots!</h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>Please look at these few photographs. The disasters in various regions are so severe that they have reached a critical point.</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of heroic soldiers have sacrificed their lives on the battlefield, and the most beautiful cities in the world have been turned into rubble. Finally, the forces of justice have shattered the delusions of the fascist madmen.</p>
<p>Humanity has once again achieved a victory. However, what follows is an even more terrifying and dreadful enemy—famine and poverty!</p>
<p>China has reached a time of unprecedented hardship. In Hunan, in Guangxi, in Henan... our compatriots are eating grass, bark, and dirt! The old and the weak often take a few steps, fall to the ground, and die. This is not the first time our country has encountered famine, but it is probably the most widespread famine in our history. The disaster areas are so vast, and the number of victims so numerous. Moreover, it is happening after a great war, which will inevitably lead to the spread of terrible plagues!</p>
<p>The relief provided by the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is so meager! When the heads of the UNRRA branch offices in various regions return to Shanghai to report, not one of them is not frazzled and struggling to cope due to the lack of relief supplies. According to the May 27th issue of the American "Time" magazine, UNRRA's Director-General La Guardia was also furious at the slow progress of the China branch's work. Indeed, we are sincerely grateful for the assistance from our friendly nations; however, distant water cannot quench a fire nearby. By the time one meeting after another has been held and one official document after another has been circulated, our suffering compatriots will have already starved to death!</p>
<p>Please look at these few photographs. Please look at these helpless children! This old woman lying on the ground! Thirty million compatriots are living this kind of life, enduring, enduring, waiting for your help!</p>
<p>Don't just wait for foreign relief! Shouldn't we Chinese people ourselves do our part first? Are we just going to watch our own people starve to death?</p>
<p>Some suffering compatriots have traveled thousands of miles, wandering to Shanghai. Shanghai has tall buildings, and Shanghai is crowded with people wanting to eat. However, the Suzhou Creek divides Shanghai into two completely different worlds. Henan is crowded with people, and in Hebei, empty houses are still sealed up. Rice prices are soaring, factories are closing, and Shanghai is not a paradise!</p>
<p>Of course, "born in sorrow, die in ease," sorrow can make us especially aware and work harder. However, looking at the widespread desolation, it seems that we should not remain silent and inactive.</p>
