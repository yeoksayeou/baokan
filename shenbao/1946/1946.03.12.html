<h3 id="c9">宋院長政治報告（三續） <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>本席也已聽到有人批評，說接收敵僞產業情形紊亂，這大槪指開始期內而言，在日本投降的時候，本席還在國外，但旣然擔任行政院長的職務，在開始接收時的紊亂情形，本席當然不能辭其咎的。就上海說，開始接收的時期，黨政軍各機關去接收的有十幾個機關，封倉庫封房屋拿捕漢奸嫌疑人犯，情形紊亂得很，本席奉總裁命令，於十月十一日到達上海，遵照總裁諭令，限各機關於三日內將所有接收封存物資，開列淸單報吿，一面即設立敵僞產業處理局，接收各機關所封存的物資，統一依照規定處理，此後又到北平，天津，青島，廣州各地，都由行政院設立處理局接收處理。在行政院負起責任來辦了這件事，當然免不了多方面不能諒解，但為求收支平衡，以避免通貨膨脹，不能過慮各方面的批評，即使確有這種一時不能諒解的地方，也是負責人所應付的代價。總之，國家收支，必須先有走上平衡之趨勢，而後人心可以安定，物價可以平穩，物價平穩之後，所有不事生產的游資，就能導入正常工商事業。人心安定，物價平穩，始可實行整理幣制，幣制整理完成，工商業纔有復興的基礎。</p>
<p>員工待遇提高　應有合理調整</p>
<p>從穩定物價上，應當提及一件目前極迫切重要的事，就是政府機關及國營事業員工待遇的提高問題，因物價不穩而生活高漲，待遇自應有合理的調整，政府亦必通盤籌劃，訂定改善的標準。但爲國家及大衆的利益著想，希望大家能抱着忍耐及合作的精神，把改善的要求，不超出合理的程度，吾則國庫支出允多，物價之高漲允快，結果薪津雖提高，仍無補於事。因一部份自身　眼前之利益，以毀壞經濟的全局，想非多數人所願見。</p>
<p>應付經濟危機增加物資供給</p>
<p>政府應付經濟危機的方略，第二是增加物資的供給，在抗戰期內，旣然無法轍入物資，也不能大量生產供應，因之無法穩定物價，目下政府一方面向國外竭力設法取得物資，其來源爲：（甲）善後救濟項下物資，一部份爲食糧衣服等臨時救濟物資，一部份爲交通工業總復員需要的工具機械原料，（乙）利用美軍在遠東剩餘的物資，此項包括種類甚繁，數量亦多，可以供應民間目前急需，（丙）甩政府國外資金，購進物資，（丁）向美國及加拿大等闕，長期貸借外款，輸入機器及原料，（戊）向日本要求賠償之物資。</p>
<p>同時政府一方面當盡力設法增進國內農工業之發展，以增加國內物資之生產，欲使國內經濟繁盛，政府當直接使人民能得到國外之機器及原料，以促進其生產的力量，而間接的且更重要的，是政府應當盡力恢復社會秩序及水陸交通，平穩物價，以安，生活，抑低利息，則企業復興定物資之供應自能給足。〔未完〕</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：自上星期六荷軍在爪哇登陸之後，該方而形勢復告緊張。今日戰事再度爆發，在距離巴達維亞六十五英里處，印度尼西亞部隊襲擊英方運輸隊，雙方開火，結果，英方官兵死七人，傷二十五人，印度尼西亞方面之死傷則不詳。當交戰時，英軍隊乞援，英方遣派飛機助陣，出動五次之多。印度尼西亞總理沙利今向英荷提出抗議，指荷軍登陸爪哇，已破壞印度尼西亞之主權，荷軍軍紀亦欠佳。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：過去一星期中，英美對於中國東九省，伊朗，保加利亞諸問題所表現之相同的態度，使人益信英美非採取共同政策，不能阻止蘇聯在亞細亞洲之野心。英政府對於邱吉爾氏在富爾敦發表之演說，雖未正式表示贊成，然而前輩外交家及高級軍八之主張與美國緊密合作者，則已日見增加。</p>
<p>蘇聯之拒不討論中國東九省問題，使人深感不安。英國對於蘇聯此種一意孤行，不顧聯合國義務之行動，顯然深感遺憾。</p>
<p>倫敦方而現所猜測者，即爲蘇聯是否願意將此等問題交聯合國機構或其他國際會議審查？或蘇聊仍當單獨行動，不顧外界之反感。如莫斯科繼續採取後一途徑，則邱吉爾之英美合作論，甚至在工黨之親蘇份子中，亦可獲得贊同。</p>
<p>〔又電〕紐約泰晤士報稱：英國於此次戰後，實力大爲削弱，不了解英國之人確以爲英國已降爲二等强國，不列顚帝國將逐漸分解，蘇聯顯然亦具此感想，故正集中全力對英國發動神經戰，以便於兩大強敵中先消滅軟弱之一個。今日英帝國致力於生存之奮鬥，不减於戰爭最嚴重之期，一方面爲印度埃及巴力斯坦等地民族遝動之勃起，一方面更須應付共產主義俄羅斯之攻勢。英國於勝利以後，仍不能安享和平與安全，邱吉爾所提創之英美合作論，亦不渦將均勢政策擴大至於世界政治而已。</p>
<p>蘇報指斥邱翁演詞</p>
<p>〔又電〕眞理報今日評論邱吉爾在富爾敦發表之演說，題日「邱吉爾揚槍示威」，略調：邱吉爾之力言三次大戰不可避免，意在發動對蘇之戰爭，邱吉爾主張英美締結軍事同盟，以對付三强中之一强，究其目的，無非欲以英次統制世界，實行强權政治耳。邱老深知孤掌難鳴，獨力不足以完成對蘇聯之包國圈，故主張英美締結軍事同鹽，俾不列顚帝國得以苟延殘喘，實行其帝國主義之政策。</p>

<h3 id="c29">社論　今日的造林運動 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>一年一度，今日又是植樹節了。各地黨政各機關，照例舉行造林運動，自有一番盛况。而以今日這個運動，其意義尤爲深刻。因爲抗戰八年，各地的樹木，在各式軍用的各義下，統統砍伐盡凈了。一切建築木材，固已仰屋興嗟，便是日用燃料，也已實際達到了「薪桂」的地步，一般民衆，都感到舉火維艱的痛苦。</p>
<p>不過這種造林運動，如果按照常年舊規，照例舉行一度，在實際的效用上，究竟有多少影響，不容不加以檢討。聞見所及，有許多植樹的地方，不到幾天，早被人有意無意地攀折馨盡，尤以道傍所植的樹，其受害爲最普遍。所以樹儘管植，而林總是造不起來。</p>
<p>凡是參加這個運動的人，什之八九，還是各繼關的職員和學生，民衆始終居少數，農民尤其是少數中之少數，所以造林的風氣，始終還沒有養成，因而收不到廣大的功效。</p>
<p>對于上面所述的第一點，我們認爲一方面固然要植新樹，造新林，而另一方面，對于過去所植的樹，所造的林，似有切實加以保護與管理的必要。主管機關，職責所在，不應當單管造林，同時還應當顧到保林。造林是一時的，保林却是經當的。造新林，植新樹的時候，對于舊林，老樹，應吾檢查一下？倘有漫不經意，被人蹧踢掉的，這個責任問題，應吾追究一下？似乎都値得注意。</p>
<p>至於一般民衆，感不到深切的興趣，這問題，自然很複雜。我們認爲已往的宣傳太浮泛，並未能深入民間，應是其中原因之一。現在各地保甲，業已普遍成立，我們認爲集中造林，空言宣傳，還不如利用農村保甲，配給樹木，勸令栽植，來得切實而有效。</p>
<p>如此辦理，當然需要大量的樹苗，事實上能吾辦到，成了問題。但是農林場，苗圃，這一類設備，各市縣早已應有盡有。假如決定政策，先事準備，這問題，並非無法解決。而且舉行一次造林運動，總需要一筆經費。就是移用這一筆經費來購買樹苗，廣爲分發，其效用之宏大，與宣傳之切實，也決計不會在舉行一個典禮之下。</p>
<p>除掉植新樹，造新林之外，對于原有的林木，已吾儘量利用，我們也不無疑問。復員以來，足足已經半年了。浙閩皖諸省木材的來源始終還沒有暢通。在此洋本未到，存底枯竭的時候，各地的建築事業，也始終沒有恢復得起來，內地的木客和山戶，在捐稅，運輸等等陣礙之下，更無法解除其困難。古語說得好，「民之趨利，猶水之就下焉」，一般商民，只須有利可圖，提倡，運動，還是多餘。「由今之道，無變今之俗」，使產戶無利可圖，商人裹足不前，那末，一年一度的照例運動，恐怕未必能實現，預期的希望吧！</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕英美及加拿大合組之聯合糧食局，本星期內當提出重大之建議，以分配世界之穀麥，中國印度及歐亞數萬萬人民之命運，咸將受其決定。該局對於中國之糧食狀况，已獲完全之報告。中國糧食部長徐堪近謂，聯合國善救總署長雷曼曾電該部，囑中國之飢民在秋收以前，縮緊褲帶至最大限度。徐堪謂日本投降後，因交通綫之破壞，糧荒益形嚴重，日本軍民撤退之遲緩，又奪去中國一大部份之糧食，中國軍米籌措困難。在九月底以前，需要食米一千萬包，中國擬請聯合國善救總署至緬甸暹羅及越南辦米救濟，馬歇爾特使返華盛頓時，當代表中國政府向聯總呼籲。聯合糧食局已聆畢印度糧食代表團之陳訴，各地向該局申請者有多起，日本及德國亦請其增撥糧食，麥帥曾請該局於本年上半年運穀一·二五〇·〇〇〇噸赴日接濟，然英國糧食大臣史密斯對此已表反對，英政府同時亦反對增運糧合赴傳國。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕軍政部海軍處副處長周憲章，於九日由京來滬。本報記者特於昨日午後往訪，承周氏詳談我國海軍情况。關於重建海軍，目前雖積極進行，然具體辦烤雞，尙須待美軍駐華軍事顧問團成立後，與海軍顧問從長計劃。據周氏談，建設海軍決非在三數年內可能吿成。不但海軍本身　之建設應注重，其他各項配備尤爲重要，如建造軍艦，港口，材料裝配，均應平均發展。又如今後新式戰艦均以汕燒，我國採汕數量極少，尙須發掘油礦，建立油廠。諸如此類問題，非有大量資金，自辦重工業不可。而人才缺乏，尤為最大困難。目前雖有英美等國協助，贈予船舶，但無人才，則根本不能利用。而靠他國援助，　非長久之計。陳誠部長，對於培養海軍人才，極爲關懷，決意改善海軍待遇並提高士兵水凖。周氏極盼中國亦能仿英美等國，每年舉行一「海軍週」，將軍艦分別停泊各港口，供市民公開參觀，引起一般青年對海軍發生興趣，一方而將軍艦駛往有華僑居留之各地，使華僑亦能從事海軍工作。</p>
<p>少數人員學成歸國</p>
<p>海軍訓練分基本及實施工作兩方面，現實施訓練已在靑鳥進行，以後擬在江浙沿海舉辦海軍學校及連營等實行基本訓練。現在美國受訓之海軍人員約計一千餘人。在英國者計三百七十餘人。其中有少數人員已學成返國工作。美國贈送我國軍艦計八艘，現在古巴。其中載重最大者約一千七百餘噸，內二艘係驅逐艦，二艘魚雷艇，四艘掃雷艇。接艦人員數百人已於去年赴美，俟訓練吿成後，將於本年六月底駕駛各艦來華。又英國贈我軍艦定十三艘，內一艘將於四月底由受訓人員駕駛來華。英國訓練係採分批制，即一艦訓練完畢後移交，再開始另一艦訓練。第三批前往受訓者已於最近抵英。在靑島受訓之海軍係由美海軍當局供給登陸艇，按一員一師辦法授習，造成專門人員。每月一期計官員十五人，士兵一百五十人。現已成立四期，訓練期限按成績而定。訓練完成後即將該登陸艇移交。第一期可於四月底結束。</p>
<p>接收日艦破壞不堪</p>
<p>至接收日本軍艦，現正加緊修理，蓋日軍戰敗，其所遺船隻均係破壞不堪，多數無可應用。周氏表示接收中之小型船隻應在沿海各口岸分頭修理，不應全部集中上海，致分配不勻，延長時間。</p>

<p>前任瀋陽附近美軍集中營管理之日戰犯三木遂，昨日在美軍法庭首次受審，彼於日本投降後，即與其妻匿居上海虹口，至今年春被捕。該瀋陽集中營，曾住有美軍一千二百名，其中有美士兵與海軍二百名，因種種不同之影響而致死。</p>
<p>三木遂昨晨九時被憲兵帶入法庭，原吿律師提出罪名九項，並曾以該集中營之美戰俘之來信數通為憑證，述三木遂之罪狀。據彼等稱：威林鐘氏被拘於集中營時，爲一</p>
<p>非常伊朗</p>
<p>之人，日人令其作苦工，某日威林鐘氏於工作完畢時，受某同情其遭遇之東北人中國香烟十五包，爲日兵在其身上搜出，乃詢其香烟之由來。鐘氏不願牽連別人，堅不肯吐露贈烟者之姓名，三木遂爲要彼「說眞話」，曾述續棍打鐘氏迷四小時之久，次日又打之如故，時値寒冬，瀋陽溫度在零度以下，鐘氏</p>
<p>衣不蔽體</p>
<p>被困暗室　中，僅有毛　一條禦寒，由毒打而致重疾，四日後在飢寒交迫下死於病院中。三木遂向衆詭稱：鐘氏死於肺炎，實則由於不堪虐待所致，各證明信件，對於三木遂之殘虐，多所叙述。至十二時退庭，下午二時，美籍醫官米威特出庭作證，解述肺炎之成因及其致果。被吿律師欲證明鐘氏死於肺炎，原吿律師則欲解釋鐘氏之死，大部由於被打受冷而得肺炎，故其死因，三本遂</p>
<p>不能辭咎</p>
<p>其次又有證人來信，歷述集中營內之慘狀，及三木遂動輙打人之暴行，並列舉被虐打者之姓名，三木遂在吿席上默然靜坐，雖在聆聽其犯罪經過，而面無慚色，該案可能在本星期三宣判，杜立德飛行負被害案，以證人尙未到齊，或將延遲遲一二日。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶訊〕復旦大學學　，起因於東北事件之愛國遊行，有學生蔣富翹用筆名「冷眼」在「谷風」壁報上發表一文，略謂：「××部主辦遊行示威，先生發該國國幣五千，卡車相送，學生不參加遊行要開除，敎授扣薪金二月，當今之日，學生敎授何其難當也！」</p>
<p>學生審學生</p>
<p>該校若干同學於三月二日上午十時左右，貼出對該壁報質問啓事後，即有學生多人聚集，羣情憤激，遂將王編該壁報之學生莊明三帶至大禮堂質問，並在登輝堂前罰跪，是時訓導處力予制止，再三勸導無效，在感情激動之際，並有極少數學生對勸導之師長有侮辱行爲，後經竭力勸導始散。學生莊明三，亦早由訓導長送入課室內休息。此事發生時，適該校章益校長不在北碚，因公在渝，聞訊後，即於次晨趕回校中，當即論令學生靜候學校查明事實，分別依章處理。是日（三日）下午召開敎授談話會，大體意見一致，乃於四日上午紀念週席上，由章校畏對全體學生剴切訓話，其要點爲：學校紀律必須維持，肇事學生必須懲處，學生應尊敬師長，同學間應和睦相處。出席紀念週師生一千餘人頻以熱烈鼓掌表示接受。</p>
<p>開除二學生</p>
<p>下午舉行訓導會議，決定將肇事學生但家瑤（拖拉同學罰跪並侮辱師長之學生），蔣當翹（誣衊文字之作者），開除學籍，學生莊明三爲「谷風」壁報負責人，原負連帶責任，姑念其已受刺激，免予處分。其餘有關學生分別情節輕重，予以懲戒。並布吿諄囑學生應本親愛精誠之精神，永維學校之令譽云云。（隆）</p>

<p>— 蕭金</p>
<p>當然一所新辦的學校，總比不上有歷史的完美，可是由於李博士的聲譽和毅力，終於把一切都弄齊起來，一切走上了軌道。</p>
<p>校址的全貌</p>
<p>校址，在城外七公里的瀘山上。敎室，宿舍，是利用山上的寺廟，它背山面水，對面是一浩瀚的「邛海」，周圍五六十公里的湖沼。據富地人的傳說，在漢爛時，邛海還是一座很大的城市，不久，因地震而陸沉。　海的四周，是光光的童山，西昌城，在它的西南端　山附近，風景很是幽雅，有時，在平靜的水面上，蕩着一葉小舟，很有脫世的風味。</p>
<p>具了這樣的條件，師資，設備，環境，「西康技專」似乎應改成一所大學，因爲在西康，還沒有一所大學，是以李博士在九年夏天，不怕長途跋涉，到了重慶，向當局交涉，把它改爲大學，然而得不到結果。當他老人家回到學校後，他悲痛地把失敗的消息，報吿給數百顆懷着熱望心的靑年，於是一切都變化了，一切都消沉了。</p>
<p>李博士離校</p>
<p>三十年，李博士離開學校，辭去校長的職務，接任的是宗達還博士，也是北洋工學院和西康技專的敎務長。他雖是一個辦校的老手，然而在那時的情形下，他只能維持原狀，隨李博士來的敎授，跟着去了，他只能另請了一批。卅一年，在困難中，添設了六萍制的醫科，他計劃先成立了農醫工三院，然後向當局請求改爲大學，可是這種努力，像天上的浮雲，輕飄地給吹到了烏託邦去了。</p>
<p>卅二年春季，周博士病倒在重慶，校務由敎務，總務，訓導，三位主任輪流負責，這時的學校，已走到了山窮水盡的一步，敎授，同學，大批的離開了學校，學校的生命，亦岌岌可危，像暴風雨中的飛鳥，隨時能被滅亡。</p>
<p>新校長就任</p>
<p>到了卅三年春天，「西康技專」的命運，似乎是轉變了些。新校長雷祚雯氏，（）也是北洋工學院的老將，一位礦冶學家），到了學校，學生們開了一個歡迎會，像久失了保姆的孩子，股股地訴吐着心中的委曲，而「西康技專」亦像一所荒鞠了的園地，又有了一位努力不懈苦幹動懇的園丁。</p>
<p>二年來懇植的結果，一切都上了軌道，一朶朶含有生命力的花朶，一顆顆結實豐肥的果實，呈現在我們的面前，「西康技專」復興了，在學校的每個人的心中喊出了這麼一句的話來。</p>
<p>然而抗戰勝利的喜訊，亦終於傳播到邊遠的西昌，離家八年，誰不想返鄉省親？而「西康技專」的師生，百分之七十是外省的人，這事傷透了置校長的腦筋，亦苦壞了外省籍師生的內心，　今大家還不安地等待着當局的辦法。</p>
<p>西昌，這邊地中的天國，它有富庶的物產，優美的風景，溫暖的氣候，可是缺少文化，缺少交通，更缺少强有力的治安，和遠見的政策，隨着戰爭的結東，「西康技專」處在這種環境下，它的前途是不太樂觀，今秋，忙於復員的今秋，師生的來源，更是一個極大的問題！</p>

<h3 id="c103">陰影中透露光明的憧憬　從蘭州看西北 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 本報蘭州特約記者冰子三月三日寄</p>
<p>黃河冰橋解凍了，春神已聞始降到蘭垣。春節後，突作惡性上漲之　市物似，日來逐漸下跌，黃金由每兩十七萬元，已跌至十三萬元。大米由每市石四萬六千元，跌至四萬元，小麥由每市石二萬二千元，跌至一萬七千元。</p>
<p>從蘭州看西北，我們看到的是：在動盪中求生存，在安定中求進步。未來是一片光明的遠景，目前却是黯淡與掙扎的苦境。</p>
<p>甘肅近影</p>
<p>其實，甘肅的遠景，是値得人憧憬的。它的重工業原料雖然不多，石油却是它最大的寳藏。玉門油礦已是全國馳名，最近蘭州附近，又發現大量汕層。它可能是將來「中國的油庫」，</p>
<p>有史以來，首次伸入甘境的寶天鐵路通車後，天蘭鐵路也正由省府在力爭提前開工，最近，新疆各界又在呼籲興修甘新鐵路。公路方面，西（安）蘭路，甘寗路，甘青路，甘新路，在抗戰期中，今後建國期中，都曾或將盡它最大的功用。將來包（頭）寗（夏）鐵路完成，再能展修至蘭州，加上歐亞空運的開闢，甘肅將如美前副總統華萊士所說：是世界交通的中心。可是目前它却陷入了災荒與人材逐漸虛空的境地。</p>
<p>全國水力發電工程總處蘭州勘察隊，已於日前出發黃河下游　蘭縣境之桑園峽勘察，該隊原定一年勘察完畢，現以美名工程師薩奇凡，將於本年秋來華，已決定提前於九月前完成水力發電勘察工作。</p>
<p>靑年團甘支團籌辦之蘭州日報，將於靑年節問世，該報出版後，此間共有四家日報。</p>
<p>去年全省歉收，災情嚴重，迫在眼前的春耕種籽問題，和靑黃不接之際的民食問題，已爲各方重視。</p>
<p>工業掙扎</p>
<p>谷正倫主席已赴後，他將在二中全會力爭於今春興修大蘭鐵路，主要的目的，還是在用工程費四十億元來辦理以工代賬。</p>
<p>勝種後，在甘肅一些技術人員，紛紛參加復員工作，於是，甘肅僅有的工業，停頓的停頓，關門的關門，連玉門油礦，也都受到了極大的影響，產油量已在銳減。總之，甘肅無論民生工業，或其他一切，今年是在掙扎中。</p>
<p>寗夏青海</p>
<p>寗夏和靑海，在兩位回敎名將馬鴻逵和罵步芳治理下，多年來可說在安定中求進步的好榜樣。政治上也許有些不够「民主」的地方，可是寗夏的水利，戶政和地政，靑海的築路和造林，都有很大的成功。靑海祗有甘靑公路可通，寗夏也僅有平（凉）寗，寗綏（遠），及年前完成的蘭寗路可通。由於交通的不發達，外邊的人多不願意進去，裏邊的人也很少出來。因此，我們願代寗靑兩省喊出「交通第一」，「人材第一」的口號。</p>
<p>刧後綏遠</p>
<p>綏遠——這個在七七事變之前以百靈廟抗戰馳名的省份，勝利後，它又因被共軍圍攻而出名。去年十二月，歸綏，包頭，雖然解圍，食糧和煤的供應，却成了全省最大的問題。目前它在全國各省中，是生活費用最高的一省。麵粉每斤五百元，煤炭每斤八十元。平綏路將來如能暢通，綏遠的煤鐵——據日人調查報吿，除東北外，它居於全國第二位——將爲建國盡最大的功用。而黃河百害唯富一套的綏西，也可供大量的移民。但是，這一切都需要以國家的力量來開發，舉辦。</p>
<p>新疆概況</p>
<p>新疆的富源，新疆的重要，無庸記者說明。民國成立以來，新疆一直就在戰亂中。廿一年以後，盛世才用了恐怖政策，統制了新疆十年多，可是，在他離開新疆後，所謂「伊寗事件」便展開了。因爲這事，我們的國軍和在新疆的官民，犧牲了不少的人，去冬，張治中部長赴新調處後，這個變亂，似乎平息了，一般人也認爲決不至再有不幸事件發生了，然而近來仍時常有「哈薩克」在新作亂的傳說，究竟怎樣一回事，官方未證實，誰也模不淸。</p>
<p>記者站在西北工作的崗位上，願再籲請全國入士重新注視西北。外蒙獨立後，西北已成了國防最前綫，同時，不僅東北是我們的生命錢，新疆也是我們的生命錢，怎樣來保持或開發道個生侖綫，更需要全國的有志之士到西北來！（三月三日寄）</p>
<h3 id="c104">台灣歸來 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 未名寄</p>
<p>本報六日訊</p>
<p>久經淪陷的臺灣，在這次敵人屈膝以後，重回祖國的懷抱，這是中國的光榮，也是臺胞的幸運。毫灣經日本五十年的經營，舉凡農邨，水利，交通，金融，教育，工業，醫院等事業，就記者觀察所及，都有顯著的成績。但是敵人在時，平時對臺胞壓榨太甚，所以民生很痛苦，更無自由之可言。此次經工政府派員接管，予以解放，臺胞自極歡迎。不過記者在臺數月，深覺有幾點危機所伏，不得不報告國人，促當局注意，或可為此後施政的借镜：</p>
<p>生活負担　較前提高卅倍</p>
<p>（一）在四個月以前，記者初履產地時，米價僅台幣一元，可購一斤，到了現在，已漲至台幣三十元一斤，這就是說人民生活負担，較前已增高了卅倍。所以台地各工廠，正與國內一樣，天天在鬧着請求增加工資的工潮，地方政府爲統籌辦理起見，旣不允許任何一廠單獨增加工資，以致糾紛日烈，一般工人，甚有藉此毆打日籍廠負以洩夙憤之事，這類工潮，如不及早使其平息，究非地方之福。</p>
<p>接派監理視聽難期周徧</p>
<p>（二）臺灣在未接收以前，原有日籍公務人員的二萬人，而這次我國政府派往接收之公務員，連技術人員在內，共計不到二千人，以致除幾個公營事業，如鐵路等，已算接收外，其餘各工廠只能派員監理，（廠內一切仍由日人管理）。往往一個人須監理工廠數所，（最多者一人監理九廠），人的精力有限，耳目所及，又無從局視　聽，試想這種監理工作，是否有效。何况日人，目前鑒於本土經濟狀况，逐漸走入復興之路，正都想離台回國，此後我國如何接收台各種企業，問題確是嚴重。</p>
<p>職員叫苦家庭生活困難</p>
<p>（三）政府派往接收台灣之公務人員，聽說在國內按月可發給家用三四萬元，本人在台，按月另可支臺幣二千三百元，在這二千三百元中，政府並允許每人可以一千元折合國幣三萬元，（即台幣一元，換國幣卅元），代爲匯寄　內，補助家用，但是現在每人在台，每餐膳費，至少須台幣卅元，區區二千三百元，實僅勉强敎衍一個人在台生活之需，如何再能節約匯寄家用呢？而且上項所說的國幣三四萬元，因爲公務機關手續煩瑣，辦事遲緩，各人家屬，目前剛剛收到一月分的付款通知書。</p>
<p>人材奇缺待遇尙須提高</p>
<p>在此物價騰漲之際，二個月前的三四萬元，尙可在上海購米四五石，今則只能購米一石數斗，豈不是無形中大打折扣？難怪最近有一位公務人員，因國內家屬，無法維持生活，憂憤之餘，竟致自縊身死！臺地人材正感奇缺，我政府正應鼓勵國人前往效力，則如何改善或提高其待遇，正是當局必須嚴加注視的急務。</p>

<p>圖示：來自世界各國的留美學生，在哥倫比亞大學機械工程科「內燃機械實室」內，研習馬達壓縮器時的一般神情。哥倫比亞大學的機械工程科，是美國各大學中規模最大的一科。各國學生紛紛到那裏去就學。這所大學在孟哈頓島上，一共建有六十九所巨厦，紐約城的大部份也橫跨在這島上。哥倫比亞大學得到英皇喬琪二世的特許，蓋造於一七五四年，那時的美國，還在殖民地位的發展時期呢。它的科學研究工作，和學程分科標準，著稱淤世。每年有三萬個學生聽講，各科敎授，訓育，敎職員等，共有三千位。對德日作戰時，美國海軍當局利用它的實騐室，講堂和宿舍，訓練出成千成萬的海軍技術人員。每隔幾個月，終有不少海軍軍官從哥倫比亞大學裏畢業出來，現在和平已經到來，哥倫比亞大學正在預備把它的施敎範圍，大事擴充，作更進一步的發展。（琴）</p>
<h3 id="c106">民主政治大動脈　美國眾議院內幕 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>在走向政治民主化途上，我政府不局現正縝密擬具各項實施民主具體方案與計劃。各省市縣參議員人選問題已次第決定。下列資料，係世界唯一强有力之民主國家盟國美利堅合衆國之主要政治機構國會——中之衆議院各方面之實施法，可資參照，亟爲刋布。編者誌。</p>
<p>由各界人士組成律師佔多數</p>
<p>遠溯美國立國時期，其最初國會，係由代表各專業界的人士組成，其中律師常佔多數。據美國政治科學協會調查結果，宣佈第七十八屆國會（一九四三至一九四五年）任期內，在五百三十一名兩院議員中，（參院議員九十六名，衆院議員四百卅五各）有三百○九名曾任律師，此外爲商人五十六名，新聞記者或出版家三十三，敎育家廿三名，農業專家十六名，經紀人一名，主婦一名。</p>
<p>參議員平均年齡爲五十九歲，衆議員的爲五十一歲，美國選民平均年齡爲四十一歲。國會議員平均敎育程度較美國公民平均敎育程度爲高。婦女選民佔美國成年選民半數以上，然而在第七十八屆國會中，婦女席數，却祇佔百分之一·五。</p>
<p>議員領菲薄津貼郵件可免費</p>
<p>憲法規定：參議衆員得領薪俸。到了一八五五年，議員始獲准領取菲薄的津貼。一八五五年參衆議員的年俸爲三千元，一八六五年爲五千元，一九〇七年又增至七千五百元，一九二五年爲一萬元。兩院議長和參院臨時主席（副總統爲參院常任主席，出缺時由議員遴選接充）年俸則爲一萬五千元。旅行津貼，按議員住宅與華府間的來回里程計算。每年屬員津貼費九千五百元，筆墨費三百元。此外，國會議員並得免費寄遞郵件。</p>
<p>每人代表三萬人議員席遞增</p>
<p>憲法規定出席國會衆議院的議員，不應超出每一人代表三萬人的原則；每州人口，按照選民人數，再加上五分之四無選舉權人民的方法統計。</p>
<p>第一屆國會時，衆議員共有六十五名。一百多年來，國會於每次人口淸查後，每次通過調整議員席數的議案，提高議員所代表的基本數。因此，州數增加，（總共增加議員四十八名，）和各州人口的激增，使衆院議員增至四百三十五名。一九二〇年戶口淸查時，宣佈議員席數，亟應調整，十一州議員席數，應予减少。然而直至一九二九年，什麼新決定也沒有，因此在這個時期中，衆議院中，實際上就沒有新增議員。一九二九年，國會通過一法案，現定按照一九三〇年的戶口淸查各州人民數字，整調衆議員席數，席數並應按照每次戶口淸查數字調整。衆院席數，仍定爲四百卅五席。</p>
<p>衆院議長在國會開會席上宣誓就職後，議員在任期內，除本人死亡，辭職或經三分之二投票通過開除外，其職位不能擅自出缺</p>
<p>議長權限已削弱多數黨選任</p>
<p>憲法稱：「衆議院應自行遴選其議長及其他官員」。議長及其他長官，常由衆院多數黨中遴選充任，並於首次會議時投票決定。議長自己宣誓就職後，並代表衆議員團體宣誓。</p>
<p>實際情形和傳統，使議長在國會裏極具重要性，一九一〇至一九一一年的「革新」，雖削減了議長的權限，然而他的重要性，仍不遜於當年。議長召集開會，承認議員有離席發言之權，引用開會法，簽署經由國會通過的法案，演辭，聯席會議次議案以及法令等等。</p>
<p>他個人的權力仍然很大，不過實際上，重要議案均由多數派次定。美國衆院和英國下院完全相反的一點，是衆院議長仍坦率地傾向其本人所屬的黨派，他所屬的黨派並常是衆院的多數派。不過他要絕對公允。議長雖保留投票權，然而除非遇到相持不下的僵局，他絕少使用投票權。</p>
<p>一九一〇至一九一一年的「革新」，剝奪議長任命任何衆院委會的權力，並使他失摔充任重要的規程委會主席的權限。</p>
<p>參院開會程序亦經憲法規定，程序應以國會初期所採的現行法規和傑斐遜的國會會議規程爲準。傑斐遜國會會議規程，是一七九七至一八〇一年傑斐遜副總統任內兼任參院主席時擬定的。現在國會採納該規程條文者很多。每屆國會開會時所印發的國會規則和規程，都包括憲法，法規和傑斐遜規程。</p>
<p>各項委員會制度執行新任務</p>
<p>國會委會制度，始自華盛頓總統任內。這種制度復於傑斐遜總統任內（一八〇一至一八〇九）一再擴展。參衆兩院均設有常務，特別等委會。美第二十七任總統威爾遜說：「委員會議事廳裏的國會，就是執行任務的國會。」</p>
<p>委會制度擴充後，一九二七年國會常務委會增至六十一個，改組後减至四十七個。其中最重要者計有：（一）審核委員會（負責徵收國家稅收）。（二）撥款委員會（負責國家支出）。（三）裁次委員會。（四）銀行業務及貨幣委員會。（五）州際及國外貿易委員會。（六）河流及港口委員會。（七）農林委員會。（八）勞工委員會。（九）軍事委員會。（十）海軍委負會。（十一）公共土地委員會及（十二）法規委員會。</p>
<p>常務會人數無定通常廿一人</p>
<p>常務委會委員自二人至四十三人不等，然而通常人數爲二十一人。衆議員可兼任三個委會職務，但是在重要委會工作的衆議員，很少兼任其他委會職務。</p>
<p>委員人選，由衆院按照一多數派組成的遴選委會提供的名單決定。多數派的平均委員人數若干由代表多數派的遴選委會決定。第七十九屆國會中，共有民主黨衆議員二百四十三名，共和黨衆議員一百九十名及其他二少數黨衆議員若干人，（其中美國工黨衆議員至少有二十二名，另一較大的黨亦同。）</p>
<p>各委員會中民主共和兩黨的委員平均數是百分六十和四十，其他少數黨的委員席數，亦視該黨衆議員的數目決定。</p>
<p>各委會主席常由多數派委員充任。主席由委會多數黨員中遴選充任。</p>
<p>每一委會在國會大厦中都有一定的集會場所。某些重要委會常有規定的集會時間，時間多在國會於午閒開會前的早晨。委會不能在國會開會時間內召開會議。委會委員可自行研究國會休會案，或由特別小組委員會研討。七十八屆國會衆院主要特別委會計有戰後經濟設計委員會；戰後軍事政策委員會；非美國人活動委員會；小規模戰時工廠委員會。</p>
<p>重要小組委員會計有：審核委員會的社會安全小組委員會；撥款委員會的陸軍部。財政部及郵務部撥款案虧損小組委員會。</p>
<p>規程委員會議程負特殊使命</p>
<p>規程委員會對國會會議程序有特別的任務。自一八五八年以迄一九一一年，衆院議長係該委會常然委員之一。一九一一年後議長離開該委會，該委會委員人選自是以後也就和其他委會申般全部由衆院各派中遴選。規程委員會委員自五名增至十名，旋又增至十二名，終於在一九三七年增至十四名。</p>
<p>規程委員會的權力，在於它可以決定討論法案的議會程序。它有取得議席發言之權，這就是說它可於辯論時打斷另一正在發言的議員而起而發言。規程委員會中的多數派屬於多數黨，是以該委員會也和多數黨的主幹委員會合作。</p>
<p>多數派主幹委員會常由二十名以上的衆議員組成，其人選由多數派自行遴選。該委會自國會議事日程中選出即將討論的議案而準備與本黨有利的行動，國會議事日程由國會與規程委員會共同排定。主幹委員會主席的重要性僅次於衆議院議長。（美新譯）</p>
<h3 id="c107">等是有家歸未得　高郵廻望路漫漫 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 陶匋寄</p>
<p>本報八日鎮江快訊</p>
<p>高郵這一個古典式的城市，它是位於鎭江至淮陰的中段，有着相當恬美與沉靜，也更有着相當繁榮的街市，素來就被人視爲是魚米之區。每年的出產，即以湖面和田間所出的生產量來說，在江北各縣之中，是佔有一個重要數字的。現在回想起來，眞是</p>
<p>不堪回首話當年</p>
<p>在十年以前，舶在運河水面上的糧船拖延下去，總是十幾里的路程，往來如梭，交通方面，在上河有着鎭江至淮陰的小火輪，寳應至高郵的單放，高郵至揚州的單放，鎭江至高郵的單放，更有着鎭江至淮陰的長途汽車，可以朝發而夕至，下河更有着直放至興化以及至泰州或東台的小火輪，總之，也是一個四通八達水陸兩便的交叉點，通訊機關，有國營的電報和電話，也更有着省營的長途電話，市內亦有着電燈和電話的設備，人是耐勞而忠誠，享着合乎需要的生活，度着悠閒而平靜的歲月，文化方面，有着八個完全的小學，一個實騐小學和縣立的初中，還有着省立的界首鄕村師範，幾家地方小型的報社，外埠如申報新聞報，在第二天的下午，便可以看到，一切的一切，都有點類似揚鎭的雛型，可是好景不常，正在這十年以內的當兒，便是</p>
<p>不幸噩夢紛紛來</p>
<p>那是日寇由東北戰爭而移到華中，由上海而至南京，終於降臨到高郵，使整個的縣城，弄成破產，然而不久，便又改換了面目，把幾條一輛軍用汽車行不過來的街道，一律改造成爲可以雙軍，併行的平坦大路，隨着帶來的便是一批一批的民族敗類，奸邪當道，翻語橫行，造成了人間的地獄，把些無事家中坐的人們，也會弄成禍從天上來，會長縣長局長之輩，又都是一些仰人鼻息之流，祇顧到自已可以苟安和搜括，便也就不顧老百姓的冤和屈了！祇知道把個寇酋拍得舒舒服服，便算盡了會長局長縣長的天職，又那顧人間的死與活，然而在這十年的當中，却也有個分野，那就是精窮的變成富翁，富翁變成了窮措大，比較有辦法的，當然是屬之於商人，商人在淪陷的期內，是一個天之驕子無往不利，這是通貨膨脹的賜予，然而到了</p>
<p>勝利局面展開後</p>
<p>人們先是不敢明目張阻的傳說，祗有交頭接耳的私議，因爲敵人還是駐紥在城內，雖然是大勢已去，好像是餘成還在，並且明白的張貼布吿，捉拿造謠滋事之流？縱然僞軍四十二師，改編成爲國軍第五師，可是這些沒用的東西，又那裏換得淸楚國家的大事，祗知道運米攤捐，提到運米，是嚴禁私人搬運，而師部是可以用着小火輸成千担的裝出，至於捐費，是沒有一個商店可以將當日的收入能够抵銷當日捐費數字的，這因爲四鄕的購戶不得來，離城三里路，便是共產軍的範圍區械，這一個三十四年度，商人是虧本了，一面要應付着大量的捐費，另一面又因着勝利後的物價，猛烈的在跌，雖不致於宣吿破產，但也累得精疲力竭，同樣的，商人旣然感到痛苦，老百姓也就不言而喩了，共中尤其是在那炎夏的天氣，江北王孫良誠到高郵視察而後，認爲防地工事不固，心血來潮，乃下令師長王和民</p>
<p>動員全城老百姓</p>
<p>全數約有五萬之眾，由每天淸晨五時起至下午六時止，在凡有駐軍的庵觀寺廟四週，一律加築土國，開溝掘澗，每戶出人一名，弄得老百姓寢食難安，稍一誤卯，便鞭撻立至，那一種悲慘非人道的虐政，恐怕就是紂王或者隋煬帝見了，也要退避三舍，自嘆不如，老百姓明知這種防禦的工事，是無濟於事，然而却沒有一個人敢言，反之，加你一個罪名，說你是通「新四軍」，那就有隨時身首異處之危險，後來把些鎭保長，都弄得逃之天夭，走不掉的尋死覓活，鬧得滿城風雨，天翻地覆，才有幾位士紳出來拚着老命不要，去向師部請願，方改由土兵替代，可是做過工的這些老百姓，一到了秋天，便都生病了，而且都是一種頑虐性的病症，筆者因爲負担不了每天雇工的代價，曾由一個十歲的女孩子，去做了三天的工，可憐一塲重病，害得死去活來，一直到了共產軍攻進縣城的時候。還是沒有復原，然而我是看着這樣的環境，我是不得不含着一把熱淚，跳了出來，可憐的孩子啊！你也是民主，我也是民主，我們就過的這樣</p>
<p>民主式的怪生活</p>
<p>共產軍攻進高郵外圍的時候，是在「人生幾見月當頭」的那天晚上，眞是不費吹灰之力，便垂手而得，所做的那此勞民傷財的土圍和碉堡，可算是效用毫無，到十一的晚上，共軍開始進攻磚城，不論那一種人士來估計，至少總要費些相當時日的，就是在共軍的本身方面來佔計，據說也不是一件易事，因爲攻打興化及鹽城，都是幾日幾夜之後才得解決，而况高郵的城內，不但有着三四千的僞軍，還有一千餘的鬼子，更加着乎在這七天之內，又由飛機送來四十萬發的子彈，然而事實總是相反的佔着多數，從第一顆子彈的響聲起時，不到三個鐘點的光陰，便結局了高郵縣城，是全軍覆沒，人鬼投降，師長逃遁，便是飛機送來的大批子彈，因爲號碼不投，也就全部奉送，人民的死傷，是沒有淪陷時那樣慘重，而房屋的被焚，却是高郵的一個空前，現在再來談一談</p>
<p>共軍入城的活動</p>
<p>第一個動作，是出示安民，接着的玩意便多了，舉辦曾在僞軍服務過的登記，以及曾在僞組織的機關或學校的自新登記，使用抗幣，一元合僞幣五千元，現在據說已漲到八千元，抗幣的升降，是以物價的漲落爲對象，其實也不盡然，方到高郵的米價，僅有四百元一担，現在已到七百元一担了，舉行欺人的人民公審大會，組織各種公會，限定商店不能收歇，店員不許開除，而共軍却開了大批的商塲，這些商塲的性質，又都是包羅萬象，上自油鹽布疋·紙張文具·五洋五京，下至茨菇鷄蛋，無一或缺，現在連水爐都在開市了，我不敢說抽了與不抽丁，祇曉得第一批到高郵的軍隊，全是浙江及江南的口音，而第二批來的，則全是我們鄰縣興化柬台鹽卑的聲調，女性政治員，大的是智識上的關係，都是江南的出產佔着多數，內地則很少，他如所謂「民軍」，卻全是道地的土貨，數目有多少，那是無法估計的，還有所謂「秧歌舞」，大的凡是共軍，恐怕都懂得這一套，現在已經推進到深入民間，尤其是</p>
<p>四鄉一般大姑娘</p>
<p>當爲了必習的课程，小的由十歲上下的年紀就學習起，大的也有三十至四十的少婦，都會學得把一個屁股弄得扭扭搖搖的擺動，可是城裏呢？，雖還沒有辦到，但是在小學的方面，已經列為正堂的運動之一了，長遠下去，這一種話劇，是可以普遍下去的，共軍入城快近兩月了，人民似乎並不感到甚麼痛楚，那是等於一個人在被刀創之後，當時是不知到疼痛，但到了痛定思滿而後，才覺得難過，所以一到了相常的時期，便都沒命的望外逃亡，現在流落在揚鎭京滬一帶的難民，恐怕數目要在十萬以上，逃亡是逃亡了，可是又那來這些安身之地，時到今日，感着金盡床頭的，也就大有人在望望大勢是如此，更沒有得到人們的一點垂憐，已經有人發起還鄕運動，理由是簡單而沉痛，與其餓死在異地，還不如直截了當的死在家鄕。</p>

<h3 id="c113">自己的人生 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>基督教箴言報專欄作家瓊斯，曾在海德公園與羅斯福總統聊些閒話。他問羅斯福：「是否希留詹姆士上校（羅的長子）也成總統一樣偉大的人物？」羅斯福一本正經地回答說：「以自己來作兒孫的前途的標準，這是一個驕傲，也是一個貌視。」</p>
<p>這個答案只有一個意思，就是人生是自己的！</p>
<p>這些年問，我們見到關於「人生」一類的書，什麼人生之路，人生與修養，處世秘訣，人生經驗談......很有目不暇接的樣兒。這一類的書，也許寫的人都是老於世故的「過來人」，也許動　頂正當，內容頂實在，但問題在這些東西是否能響應單個的人生？</p>
<p>我們必須承認，人生是「自己」，「個人」的。某一個人的人生經驗，成功，修養，永遠不能當作一幅地圖看。以為別人闖了一條人生之路，我就可機械地值此以進，跟着走了。那是一個非常的錯誤。</p>
<p>人生應該是創造的，不是摹倣的；人生是開闢的，不是追隨的；人生更是「今天的」，不是罐頭的，不是古　的！</p>
<p>克魯基夫存心要做高爾基的「門生」，他致力學習高爾基的　調，研究高爾基的生活背景，分析高爾基的中心思想。但高爾基拍拍他的肩膀道：「孩子，照你自己的方面去努力吧！倣學高爾基是一件愚昧的事。</p>
<p>拿自己的人生，來做他人的模型，這是一個可鄙的驕傲；拿他人的人生來作自己的紙版，這是一個可怕的毀滅。自己的前途永是漫無止境的！</p>
<p>這並不是呌我們作一個自命不凡，眼高一切的人，乃是說，人生是具有「多型的單獨性」的。玫瑰和薔薇總算差不多了，但你不能把人家的玫瑰作我的薔薇。自己打　自己的人生，自己創造自己的人生，那時，你會附和雪萊的名詩——「螞蟻和蒼蠅」——唱道：</p>
<p>「我不和你——蒼蠅——作比較。我有我的一生！」</p>
<p>我們再說，以別人的人生作碑帖的，最高的成就，也不過是人生的尾巴而已。</p>

<p>我國海空軍素來不及陸軍，但是自從經過這次立體式的戰爭後，海空軍方始抬頭，尤其是空軍，它發揮了無上的威力，在抗戰史上立下了不可磨滅的功績。</p>
<p>一九三二年，中國空軍在物資極度缺乏的環境下誕生，中央航空學校正式於杭州成立，這是我國空軍的胚胎時期。</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰　發後的第二天（西歷一九三七年八月十四日）成長不久的空軍居然英勇地出擊敵艦，予頑敵重大的打擊，這實在是敵人與上海市民所意想不到的事，短短的五年中，奠定了中國空軍的地位，此後八月十四日就規定為我國的空軍紀念日，這是我國空軍的幼年時期。</p>
<p>以後。我們得到了盟邦的協助與接濟，就成立了一支強大的勁旅，在各次的保衛戰中，發揮了它最大的效果，贏得了各國的同情，尤其是美國，在艱難的環境下更派了許多的空軍人員來幫助我們，終於擊敗了強敵，獲得最後勝利，這是我國空軍的發育時期。</p>
<p>在抗戰時期中，空軍作戰司令部分佈在重慶.桂林.成都.蘭州與昆明五地，最大的戰術單位是由幾個飛行中隊所編成的聯隊，而每個飛行中隊包括十二架飛機，而其本身即為一基本的戰術單位，所以，我國空軍的組織大體上與各國類似。</p>
<p>現在戰爭已經結束，我們又聽到陳納德將軍的行踪，據聞中央航空學校又將遷回杭州，又聞昆明已有中國傘兵表演，對於空軍前途我們期望正殷，希望中國的空軍在成年時期中對於國防上有所貢獻，那就符合我國設立空軍的意思了。</p>

<h3 id="c115">整飭學校風紀 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 西園</p>
<p>八年抗戰，國民物質上的損失，固不可勝算。而精神上的戕賊，更不可以筆墨形容。別的不講，單就教育方面，從學校風紀一端而言，已是萬分痛心。這裡所謂學校風紀，並不專指學生紀律的好壞。凡關於校長教員學生，以及校工等，是否繼職，統包括在內。上海學校林立，其中辦得優良的固屬不少。可是藉學校為漁利之具，所謂「學店」也者，亦指不勝屈。做校長的，濫收學生，剝削教員，投機囤積，出賣文憑，投降失節等，無奇不有。做教師的，受生活壓迫，到處兼課，遲到缺課，學生課卷，不改不發。做學生的，當然更不成樣子了，在上課時寫情書，看小說嗎，講電影，教室秩序，比茶館還不如。教師如會應付，還能勉強上課，遇着呆板的教師，就對你下逐客令。還有校工呢？懶惰無禮貌，甚至對教員學生索小費，否則有來賓不通報，有電話不轉知，諸如此類筆不勝紀。總而言之，学校风纪，一落千丈。</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利，一切設施，漸漸恢復原狀。獨是學校風紀，依然如故。校長還是學店老闆，教師還是身兼數職，學生還是整天胡鬧，校工亦不必說。倘使長此下去，學校怎會辦得好呢？教育本為培養青年，如今變為戕賊青年，這樣壞的學校風紀，我們能熟視無睹嗎？能不從連加以整頓嗎？</p>
<p>據我意見，第一希望教育部，發布一個重振學校風紀，與砥勵士節之明令。第二上海教育局，對於各學校，有一個戰密督導辦法。第三须甄別校長教員之是否合格？與是否失節？第四令知各學校，提高程度，嚴格教導，留級開除在所不惜。第五提高教師待遇，限制兼課。第六詳查學生學籍，舉行畢業會考。第七厲行教師進修。第八編行教育刊物。以上八項，實為整飭學校風紀的主要事項，倘能依次實行。則學校風紀，定可轉衰為盛，化惡為善了。</p>

<h3 id="c116">愛因斯坦論原子彈 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 聰雋</p>
<p>自從聯合國戰勝了東西兩大侵略魁首以後，世界的前途已經透露出一線燦爛的光明。凡是愛好和平的人們沒有一個不慶幸聯合國基於道義互助合作以謀世界和平人類幸福的偉大精神。但是在另一方面又有一些人對於被稱為「和平的武器」的原子彈表示極度的憂慮。許多人說，這次的原子彈獲取世界和平，然而將來說不定世界和平就因牠而毀滅。</p>
<p>其實這也是不必要的過濾，戰爭所留下來的創痛難道還不夠給我們一個嚴重的教訓嗎？我想只要大家能彼此互信，彼此以世界和平為第一要義，和平的保證是沒有問題的。然而直到現在蘇聯和美國還是為了原子彈而煩惱，而猜忌。據最近華盛頓電訊：美眾戲院即將考慮禁外國洩露即將舉行之原子彈轟炸艦隊試驗所獲情報的議案。原因是為了美國的未來安全不致遭受威脅。蘇聯要求即將原子彈的「秘密」公開，或參加管制，原因自然也是為了怕自身遭受威脅。</p>
<p>這幾個月來，不知有多少政治家和科學家提供關於原子彈的意見。最近世界著名的科學家，相對論的發明者，愛因斯坦教授（Prol.　Albert　Einstitin）也發表了他對原子彈的意見。</p>
<p>愛氏不主張永遠把這秘密保守下去。他說：「保守原子彈的秘密，並不是人類前途的幸福。向強國報告，或由聯合國共管，都是辦法。」縱觀愛因斯坦的話，可以看出他　力主張建立國際間的互信：「我相信世界愛好和平的國家可以草擬一個為世界各國接受的具體的和平計劃。」他的眼光的確很遠大，和平不是喊空口號就能保證的，自然也不是少數人所能保證的。</p>
<p>愛氏更從心理上說明了消弭戰禍的根源，他的議論很中肯：「如果世界上的各個國家明瞭他們的問題，是不能用戰爭解決，他們便會妥協約。如果想到戰爭的悲慘結果，那麼戰爭的起因便變得無足輕重了」。</p>
<p>一部分人之所以懷着深重的憂慮，對於這次結束侵略戰爭的原子彈，仍不能不恐懼他或者會成為再度戰爭的魔王，主要的原因是由於人類還沒有能夠真正的了解和平的真諦，他們至少還有一些人認為戰爭可以解決一切，獲得一切。這實在是錯誤的，除了侵略，戰爭是不必要的，而侵略又有一個極大的現實的教訓放在目前：勝利終究屬於執着正義的一面。那麼又何必再想戰爭？你說為防止戰爭吧，那更不是靠這所謂「和平的武器」所能為力的。你防他，他防你，沒有戰爭也會先就發生對立，發生猜忌了。誠如美國眾議院一位議員說：「用戰爭來解決國際問的糾紛與爭執，已成為過去。以牙還牙，人類必永無和平的一日。」是的，國際間的一切紛爭，我們應該尋找合理的解決方式，決不需要用報復的手段。現在世界上東西兩大侵略者已經被瓦解了，正是各國共謀永遠和平的日子，大家必需建立和平的信心，——由自信到互信共信。與其憂慮戰爭的威脅，何不先從心理上消滅戰禍發生的根源，先把猜忌的心裏除去？</p>
<p>和平的力量增強了，可以匯成一條防免戰禍的主流，誰敢冒天下之大不　，誰敢做玩火者，誰就先被和平的丘浪捲沒。</p>
<p>此外，我覺得還有一點也該認清：原子能的功效　使之普遍應用於各種增進人類福利的方面，　就是說，科學家應該悉心研究把原子彈應用於一切與人類有關的生活，轉移人們對於原子能的不正確的誤解，消除人們對於原子能的片面的看法，以為牠是戰爭唯一的工具。我覺得就連「和平的武器」這個名詞，都不該議牠存生，我們索性就把轟炸廣島長畸的那最初應用也是最後應用的原子彈，稱為「和平之神」吧。</p>
<p>記取戰爭的教訓，加強和平的力量，我們應該珍重愛因斯坦的主張。</p>

<p>飛行時氣候雖然很惡劣，但是一位退伍的水手依舊隨意地飛行着，他的氧氣面具似乎並未使他感到不適，但飛至一萬六千呎的高空時，他突然開始出汗，面色轉青，於是趕快飛返機塲，進醫院治療，可是不幸得很，二十八小時後，他終於死了。</p>
<p>原來這位可憐的犧牲者，因為他沒有告訴航空綫的當局，說他以前曾在肺病診療所是經過人工氧胸（即俗稱打空氣針）的治療。他的去世是出於物理學上的　　定律：當大氣壓力減少時，肺部的空洞就開始擴大膨脹，而促成致命的併發症。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army Units Take Over Parts of Shenyang; Rumors of Communist Army Incursion and Street Fighting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 11th] The Soviet army in Shenyang will completely withdraw by tomorrow. Mr. Dong Yanping met with Soviet Chief of Staff Trotsenko at 2 PM today. Mr. Trotsenko formally notified Mr. Dong that the Soviet army had begun its withdrawal on the 7th, as the Chinese army was capable of taking over the defense of Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Urgent Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9 PM on the 11th] The Soviet authorities here handed over five barracks north of the Hun River to our army at 2 PM this afternoon. Soviet representative Major Oronov and Lieutenant Shabassretsky, together with our representatives Lieutenant Colonel Liu Tanshan and Adjutant Luo Xudong, inspected and took over each barrack, exchanging documents. The barracks are magnificently built and were used by a Soviet motor vehicle unit. In addition, we have dispatched troops to take over the Beiling Airport. The municipal government has taken over six factories from the Soviet army in recent days. Five thousand former puppet Manchukuo soldiers detained in Soviet concentration camps were released today. The Soviet diplomatic representative, accompanied by the Soviet Deputy Commander of City Defense, Trotsenko, visited Mayor Dong, requesting consideration for Soviet commercial institutions. Previously, Soviet economic advisor Itun and the manager of the Far Eastern Bank had also made similar requests when visiting Mr. Dong. The order in Shenyang is currently good, and the Soviet army has greatly reduced its presence. General Gofutang, the Soviet commander of city defense, has not yet left.</p>
<p>Telephone and Electricity Interrupted, National Army Expediting Reinforcements</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Beijing, 11th] As the Soviet army withdrawal from Shenyang nears completion, 50,000 Communist troops have begun to gather outside the city. A battle for Shenyang between the Nationalist and Communist armies seems inevitable. According to reliable sources from Shenyang, another 40,000 Communist troops are rushing to Shenyang from various parts of the Northeast. According to the latest reports obtained here, the Soviet army will complete its withdrawal by tomorrow night, leaving only a large railway guard unit to maintain the transportation line. According to the reporter's estimate, approximately 32,000 Soviet troops have withdrawn from Shenyang and the surrounding area. Reliable sources indicate that the Communist army, under the command of General Zhu De, is preparing to fight in Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Urgent Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Changchun, 10:50 PM on the 10th] The telegraph and telephone lines between Changchun and Shenyang were cut off for 25 minutes but have now been restored. According to a telephone call from Shenyang, the city's telecommunications bureau was surrounded by illegal armed forces, with machine guns set up outside the door, and there was gunfire. The city's lights also went out simultaneously, but the illegal forces were quickly dispersed, and the lights were restored.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Chongqing, 10th] According to a dispatch from Shenyang, street fighting has broken out in the city, and martial law has been declared. The Communist army began a siege of the city immediately after the Soviet army withdrew. The Chinese side attributes the unrest to the sudden withdrawal of the Soviet army, stating that the city's garrison is small and significantly outnumbered by the besieging Communist army.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Chongqing, 11th] Reports indicate that after the Soviet army withdrew from Shenyang, the National Army and the Communist army engaged in street fighting in the city. However, neither the government nor the Communist Party has been able to verify this claim. The central government authorities were not fully informed when the Soviet army began its withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Chongqing, 11th] Reports indicate that the National Army's 13th, 52nd, and New 6th Corps are advancing toward Shenyang with all possible speed. Communist troops outside Shenyang have entered the streets and been repelled by the National Army stationed in the city. Communist reinforcements are now moving out from the northern suburbs. According to Communist sources, the National Army's 14th Division entered Shenyang on the 9th, strengthening the garrison. The Soviet army originally stationed in Shenyang is on its way to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Tianjin, 11th] According to Chinese sources, Shenyang entered a state of no military garrison after the sudden withdrawal of the Soviet army. The National Army's New 1st Corps, 50th Division, has been ordered to garrison the city. Other divisions will continue to move in.</p>
<p>Communist Army Cuts Telegraph Lines; Martial Law Suddenly Declared in Harbin</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Tianjin, 11th] According to a dispatch from Shenyang, military vehicles have been moving frequently between Shenyang and Changchun in recent days. There are reports of several fires in Shenyang, but the claim that the Soviet army started the fires has not been confirmed. The telegraph line between Shenyang and Jinzhou to the south was cut by the Communist army today.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Nanjing, 11th] A report from Jinzhou states that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Tonghua, east of Shenyang, triggered a military riot on the 9th. It is claimed that 3,000 Japanese soldiers participated. It took two hours to quell the riot, and several soldiers and civilians were killed.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Harbin, 10th] Harbin suddenly went on alert at 10 PM on the 9th. All Soviet troops in the city were mobilized and searched everywhere for military equipment and weapons, prohibiting passage until noon on the 10th when the alert was lifted. It is reported that over 10,000 armed Communist troops have arrived near Lalin, 30 miles from Harbin, with the intention of occupying Harbin, and subsequent troops are continuing to gather. It is rumored that they are from Shandong.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 11th] The situation in the Northeast is undergoing a new transformation. On the eve of his departure from China for the US, Marshall visited Chairman Chiang's residence in Linyuan for several consecutive days to discuss the matter. Zhou Enlai also visited Marshall on the 10th to discuss the Northeast issue and state the Communist Party's views. Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, and others from the Democratic League also met with Marshall today to discuss the Northeast issue.

<h3 id="e3">Many Hidden Obstacles to Railway Restoration; Solutions Found for the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 11th] It is reported that although the Military Mediation Department has established a transportation group to discuss restoration methods for the national railway restoration issue, apart from certain sections of the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways that are being prepared for repairs, the restoration of most transportation routes still faces many obstacles due to sharply conflicting opinions on both sides. According to transportation industry sources, engineers previously sent to the Communist-controlled areas of Zhangjiakou to carry out restoration work were sent by the local Communist army to Mingxiakou, where they were detained for five days before being released. In addition, the Communist army has independently established railway bureaus on various routes. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has already been established, and station chiefs have been appointed, requesting the demolition of bunkers at each station. It is heard that the government, within possible conditions, still hopes to obtain reasonable consultations to allow transportation to be restored as soon as possible, so that people displaced from their homes during the War of Resistance can return to their hometowns quickly.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 11th] Reliable sources indicate that the issue of restoring the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been resolved after repeated consultations between both sides. Regarding several new conditions proposed by the Communist army recently, apart from the issue of management and personnel, which remains under discussion, the government has made significant concessions. It has been decided that work will begin on the 12th from Liguo to Yanzhou. Regarding the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, from Damiao to Baitaibu, after the Communist representative Wei Guofa from the Xuzhou group went to negotiate yesterday, it was also agreed to start work simultaneously on the 12th. It is heard that the Communist army has introduced 400 workers for the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, each receiving three catties of flour per day.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Qingdao, 10th] The Hai Zhe vessel, carrying over 2,000 tons of rails and sleepers from Qinhuangdao, arrived in Qingdao this afternoon. This is the second ship to transport railway materials to Qingdao from Qinhuangdao. The Jiaoji Railway Bureau began unloading the materials from the shore on the same day, which will be used to restore the Jiaoji Railway.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 10th] The Communist army in Rehe captured Jianping in northern Rehe on February 27th. The National Army telegraphed the Military Mediation Department to effectively stop this. Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters, personally went to Beiping to negotiate with the Military Mediation Department. The Military Mediation Department Chief of Staff meeting decided to order the Communist army to withdraw from Jianping within 24 hours. Otherwise, the National Army could take action, and the Jiafeng group was ordered to monitor the execution. The Communist army there, the 43rd Brigade, not only did not comply with the previous order but intensified its actions, dispatching troops. On March 7th, some Communist troops arrived in the area between Chaoyang and Yeboshou, sabotaging the railway and burning down the Taipingfang station. Several station masters and staff, as well as money and goods, were looted. They are still active in the area north of the railway and have not shown any signs of withdrawing north of Jianping.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military sources indicate that around 4 AM on the 10th, over 3,000 Communist troops attacked the National Army garrisoning Jianchang. Furthermore, the Communist army in the Pingquan area is frequently mobilizing. The Communist army at Gubeikou is also moving east in large numbers.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] A person from the Northeast says: The people of the Northeast, who have fallen into a deep abyss of suffering, have not only had soybeans "liberated," but also wheat, sorghum, and corn, which have been "liberated" from the "daihe" (Japanese for "offering") of the enemy puppet era. There are no more organizations like the "Agricultural Development Department" and "Agricultural Development Cooperative" in the Northeast, but "Agricultural Communes" still serve the friendly nations in various parts of the Northeast. This organization is now serving the friendly nations and the so-called People's Army in a way that scrapes the bone and sucks the marrow. People who are reluctant to contribute grain are likely to be strangled to death. Recently, the price of gold in the Northeast has risen to 170,000 legal tender per tael, and people are fleeing to Jinzhou in droves.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Second Commemoration Week of the Second Plenary Session; President Chiang Encourages Party Members to Understand the Times and the Environment and Conduct Self-Examination Humbly <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The Second Plenary Session held its second commemoration week at 9 AM this morning. After President Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered a speech, praising the enthusiastic discussion spirit of the conference this week. However, he believes that for each issue, it is necessary to understand the era and environment in which the country is situated and conduct humble self-examination so that it can make a practical contribution to national construction. Our task is extremely arduous, and comrades of the entire conference must promote party virtue, establish confidence, concentrate our will, be a model for all party members, share weal and woe, respond to the people of the whole country, and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the work of national construction. He deeply believes that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve ultimate success. The chairman's speech lasted 55 minutes. After the speech, there was a ten-minute break, followed by the 14th session, where reports on border issues were heard. Bai Yunti reported on the Mongolian banner issue and its solutions. Gesang Zecai reported on the current situation of the Tibetan people. Zhang Zhizhong also reported on the plan to resolve the Xinjiang issue. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Chongqing, 10th] Chairman Chiang stated in his speech at the Second Plenary Session today that the current task of the nation is exceptionally difficult, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented. If anyone criticizes the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, they can blame him personally, but they should not attack others.</p>
<p>The Plenary Session Closes on the 15th</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] At the 14th session of the Second Plenary Session this morning, the chairman reported that the conference period would be extended by three days, to close on the 15th. All review work by the various review committees will be completed before the 13th. According to the meeting schedule, there will be three more thematic reports (Zhang Qun's report on the process of stopping military conflicts, Zhang Zhizhong's report on the inspection of stopping military conflicts and restoring transportation, and Chen Yi's report on the recovery of Taiwan) and four more general meetings. The closing ceremony will be held at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>

<p>I have also heard criticisms that the situation in the takeover of enemy and puppet industries is chaotic. This probably refers to the initial period. When Japan surrendered, I was still abroad, but since I am serving as the President of the Executive Yuan, I cannot shirk my responsibility for the chaotic situation at the beginning of the takeover. Take Shanghai, for example. During the initial takeover period, there were more than a dozen party, government, and military agencies taking over, sealing warehouses, sealing houses, and arresting suspected Han traitors. The situation was very chaotic. I arrived in Shanghai on October 11th under the order of the President. Following the President's instructions, I ordered all agencies to report a list of all seized and sealed materials within three days. At the same time, I established the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to take over the materials sealed by various agencies and handle them uniformly in accordance with regulations. Later, I went to Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other places, where the Executive Yuan also established management bureaus to take over and handle them. Since the Executive Yuan has taken responsibility for this matter, it is naturally unavoidable that there will be misunderstandings in many areas. However, to achieve a balance of income and expenditure to avoid currency inflation, we cannot overthink criticisms from various parties. Even if there are indeed such temporary misunderstandings, it is the price that the person in charge should pay. In short, the country's income and expenditure must first show a trend toward balance, and then people's minds can be stabilized, and prices can be stabilized. After prices are stable, all non-productive idle funds can be channeled into normal industrial and commercial enterprises. With stable people's minds and stable prices, it is possible to implement currency system consolidation. After the currency system is consolidated, industry and commerce will have a foundation for revival.</p>
<p>Employee Compensation Increases Should Have Reasonable Adjustments</p>
<p>From the perspective of stabilizing prices, one extremely urgent and important matter must be mentioned, which is the issue of increasing the compensation for employees of government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Due to unstable prices and high living costs, compensation should be reasonably adjusted, and the government must plan comprehensively and set improvement standards. However, for the sake of the country and the public, I hope everyone can maintain a spirit of patience and cooperation, keeping improvement requests within a reasonable range. Otherwise, the national treasury will spend too much, and prices will rise too quickly. As a result, even if salaries are increased, it will not help. It is unlikely that the majority of people would want a situation where a part of themselves damages the overall economy for immediate benefits.</p>
<p>Addressing the Economic Crisis by Increasing the Supply of Materials</p>
<p>The government's second strategy to cope with the economic crisis is to increase the supply of materials. During the War of Resistance, there was no way to transport materials in or produce and supply them in large quantities, which made it impossible to stabilize prices. Currently, the government is doing its best to obtain materials from abroad. The sources are: (A) Materials under the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, some for temporary relief supplies such as food and clothing, and some for tools, machinery, and raw materials needed for general restoration of transportation and industry. (B) Utilizing the US military's surplus materials in the Far East. This includes a wide variety of materials and a large quantity, which can supply the current urgent needs of the people. (C) Using the government's foreign funds to purchase materials. (D) Obtaining long-term foreign loans from countries such as the United States and Canada to import machinery and raw materials. (E) Requesting compensation materials from Japan.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government should do its best to promote the development of domestic agriculture and industry to increase domestic material production. To make the domestic economy prosperous, the government should directly enable the people to obtain machinery and raw materials from abroad to promote their production capacity. Indirectly, and more importantly, the government should do its best to restore social order and land and water transportation, stabilize prices, to ensure the people's safety and livelihoods, and lower interest rates. Then, the revival of enterprises and the supply of materials can be fully guaranteed. [To be continued]</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] As the National Assembly is about to convene, various preparations are being intensified. The National Assembly Hall and the Art Exhibition Hall next to it have been undergoing urgent renovation since the 6th. The tender decision has determined that the renovation cost is approximately 400 million yuan, including 180 million yuan for woodwork, 110 million yuan for water and electricity engineering, and 120 million yuan for building renovation engineering. The project can be completed in 45 days. According to Wang Zixian, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, the assembly hall has 1,800 seats downstairs, and a total of 2,450 people can be accommodated, including those upstairs. There are special seats for news reporters and observers, which are reserved for meetings. It was originally planned to install electrical equipment for voting in the meeting hall, but it is feared that it will be difficult to realize due to lack of materials. The Central Broadcasting Administration has added sound reinforcement equipment, which will place "microphones" throughout the meeting hall, with each seat having one, regardless of the representative's seat, making speaking extremely convenient. A large amount of this equipment is needed and has been purchased from the United States. In the future, the office of the National Assembly Secretariat and various small group meetings and review meetings will be held at the Art Exhibition Hall. Office furniture will be allocated from the enemy and puppet property taken over by the municipal government. The Central University and the Central Political School have been designated as representative dormitories, and the preparatory office is actively preparing transportation. It is heard that if it is insufficient, merchants will be invited to undertake the work. The new open space of the assembly hall is planned to be closed and set up as a parking lot, which is currently being negotiated with the municipal government.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: Since the Dutch troops landed in Java last Saturday, the situation there has become tense again. Today, fighting broke out again. Sixty-five miles from Batavia, Indonesian troops attacked a British transport team, and the two sides opened fire. As a result, seven British officers and soldiers were killed and twenty-five wounded. The casualties on the Indonesian side are unknown. During the battle, the British troops requested assistance, and the British sent planes to help, dispatched five times. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir today protested to Britain and the Netherlands, stating that the Dutch landing in Java has undermined Indonesian sovereignty, and the discipline of the Dutch troops is also poor.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 11th] The British government is today implementing its policy of gradually withdrawing its troops from the Dutch East Indies. Approximately one thousand British Indian troops are boarding ships awaiting departure. According to a British statement, British troops were ambushed by East Indians between Budensosuk and Bandang last night, and fighting broke out, not ceasing throughout the night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] The Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook today held lengthy talks with British Envoy Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and British and Dutch military leaders. Southeast Asia Allied Army Commander-in-Chief General Montagu Stopford, Java Allied Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Christison, Dutch East Indies Army Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Spoor, and Far East Dutch Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Pinke were all present.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] Indonesian President Sukarno has approved Sjahrir's new cabinet and authorized Sjahrir to begin negotiations with the Netherlands.

<h3 id="e17">Without a Common Policy Between Britain and America, Soviet Ambition Cannot Be Stopped; New York Times Discusses the International Situation; The Soviet Union is Fully Launching a Nerve War Against Britain <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The New York Times special correspondent states: The identical attitude shown by Britain and America in the past week regarding the problems of the three eastern provinces of China, Iran, and Bulgaria makes people increasingly believe that without Britain and America adopting a common policy, Soviet ambitions in Asia cannot be stopped. Although the British government has not formally expressed its support for Churchill's speech in Fulton, the number of senior diplomats and senior military officials who advocate close cooperation with the United States has been increasing daily.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's refusal to discuss the issue of the three eastern provinces of China is deeply unsettling. Britain is clearly deeply regretful of the Soviet Union's unilateral actions, disregarding its obligations to the United Nations.</p>
<p>What London is currently speculating is whether the Soviet Union is willing to submit these issues to the United Nations or other international conferences for review? Or will the Soviet Union continue to act alone, regardless of outside disapproval. If Moscow continues to take the latter approach, then Churchill's theory of Anglo-American cooperation will gain support even among pro-Soviet elements in the Labour Party.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The New York Times stated that Britain's strength has been greatly weakened since this war. Those who do not understand Britain may believe that Britain has been reduced to a second-rate power and that the British Empire will gradually disintegrate. The Soviet Union clearly also holds this view and is therefore concentrating all its efforts on launching a nerve war against Britain, in order to eliminate the weaker of the two major powers first. Today, the British Empire is engaged in a struggle for survival no less intense than during the most severe period of the war, facing both the rise of nationalist movements in India, Egypt, Palestine, and elsewhere, and the offensive of communist Russia. Britain cannot enjoy peace and security even after victory. Churchill's proposed Anglo-American cooperation theory is nothing more than expanding the balance of power policy to world politics.</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Churchill's Speech</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Pravda today commented on Churchill's speech in Fulton under the title "Churchill Brandishes a Gun as a Demonstration," stating in brief: Churchill's assertion that a third world war is inevitable is intended to launch a war against the Soviet Union. Churchill advocates that Britain and America conclude a military alliance to deal with one of the three great powers, and its purpose is nothing more than to control the world with Britain and implement power politics. Old Churchill knows that he cannot clap with one hand and that he is not strong enough to complete the encirclement of the Soviet Union alone. Therefore, he advocates that Britain and America conclude a military alliance so that the British Empire can survive and implement its imperialist policies.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 11th] The Muslim spiritual leader Aga Khan (direct descendant of Muhammad's daughter Fatima) held a celebration yesterday at the local stadium for his 75th birthday using steel diamonds. More than 70,000 people attended. His body was weighed against steel diamonds on scales, weighing two hundred and forty-three and a half pounds. Representatives of Muslims from Iraq, Ibn, Nanfei, Dongfei, Syria, Lebanon, Central Asia, and Myanmar sat around the weighing platform. One end of the scale was a chair. The ceremony was held before sunrise. After Aga Khan sat upright in the weighing chair, a group of religious figures chanted the Quran, while one noble dressed in embroidered robes placed the steel diamonds into the weighing pan. The diamonds piled up higher and higher, and the crowd roared. When the two ends of the scale were balanced, the crowd cheered even louder. Aga Khan wore a blue hat, a white satin robe with silver stars, and no jewelry. His wife wore white Indian clothes, a diamond necklace and earrings, and diamond bracelets on both arms. Aga Khan's eldest son, Ali Khan, was also present. After the weighing, Aga Khan stood up and gave a speech, blessing the audience.</p>

<p>Once a year, today is Arbor Day again. Party and government agencies in various places are holding afforestation movements as usual, creating a grand scene. However, today's movement is of particularly profound significance, because during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the trees in various places were all cut down for various military purposes. All building timber is already causing sighing at the lack of housing, and even daily fuel has actually reached the point of being "expensive as cinnamon." The general public feels the pain of struggling to light a fire.</p>
<p>However, if this afforestation movement is carried out according to the old rules of previous years and held once a year, how much actual effect will it have? It is necessary to review this. As far as we can see, in many places where trees are planted, they are intentionally or unintentionally broken and destroyed within a few days, especially the trees planted along the roads, which are the most common victims. Therefore, although trees are planted, forests are never created.</p>
<p>Of all the people who participate in this movement, eight or nine out of ten are still officials and students from various agencies, and the general public is always in the minority, especially farmers, who are a minority within the minority. Therefore, the trend of afforestation has never been cultivated, and consequently, it does not achieve widespread effectiveness.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point mentioned above, we believe that on the one hand, it is certainly necessary to plant new trees and create new forests, while on the other hand, it seems necessary to effectively protect and manage the trees and forests that have been planted in the past. The responsible authorities, by virtue of their duties, should not only manage afforestation, but also take care of forest protection. Afforestation is temporary, but forest protection is constant. When creating new forests and planting new trees, should we inspect the old forests and old trees? If there is any carelessness and they are trampled and destroyed, should we investigate the responsibility for this problem? It all seems to be worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>As for the general public not feeling a deep interest, this issue is naturally very complicated. We believe that one of the reasons is that past publicity has been too superficial and has not penetrated the people. Now that Baos and Jias have been universally established in various places, we believe that concentrating on afforestation and empty talk are not as effective and practical as using rural Baos and Jias, distributing trees, and urging planting.</p>
<p>Of course, doing so requires a large number of seedlings, and whether it can actually be done is a problem. However, agricultural and forestry farms and nurseries should already exist in every city and county. If a policy is decided and preparations are made in advance, this problem is not unsolvable. Moreover, holding an afforestation movement always requires a sum of money. Even if this sum of money is used to purchase seedlings and widely distribute them, the magnitude of its effectiveness and the practicality of its publicity will definitely not be less than holding a ceremony.</p>
<p>In addition to planting new trees and creating new forests, we also have doubts as to whether we have made the most of the existing forests and trees. It has been a full half year since the recovery. The source of timber in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui has still not been unblocked. At a time when foreign capital has not arrived and existing stocks have been depleted, the construction industry in various places has still not been able to recover. Internal timber merchants and mountain households are even more unable to relieve their difficulties under the obstacles of taxes, transportation, etc. As the ancient saying goes, "The people's pursuit of profit is like water flowing downward." For the general merchants, as long as there is profit to be made, promotion and movements are superfluous. "By the ways of today, do not change the customs of today." If the producers have no profit to be made and the merchants are unwilling to move forward, then the annual routine movement will probably not be able to realize the expected hope!</p>

<h3 id="e31">Our Country's Grain Shortage is Serious; Hoping for UNRRA Relief; Ten Million Bags of Rice Needed Before Autumn Harvest; Food Minister Xu Kan Submits Appeal <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The United Grain Board, composed of Britain, America, and Canada, will put forward important proposals this week to allocate world grain, and the fate of hundreds of millions of people in China, India, and Eurasia will be determined by its decision. The board has received a complete report on the grain situation in China. Chinese Food Minister Xu Kan recently stated that UNRRA Director Lehman telegraphed the ministry, instructing the hungry people of China to tighten their belts to the maximum before the autumn harvest. Xu Kan said that after Japan's surrender, the grain shortage became more serious due to the destruction of transportation lines. The slow withdrawal of Japanese military and civilians also took away a large portion of China's grain, making it difficult to raise military rice. Before the end of September, ten million bags of rice are needed. China plans to ask UNRRA to buy rice for relief in Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. When Special Envoy Marshall returns to Washington, he will appeal to UNRRA on behalf of the Chinese government. The United Grain Board has listened to the appeal of the Indian grain delegation. There are many applications to the board from various places. Japan and Germany have also asked it to increase the allocation of grain. MacArthur has asked the board to transport 1.25 million tons of grain to Japan in the first half of this year for relief, but British Food Minister Smith has opposed this. The British government is also opposed to increasing the transport of grain to the country.</p>
<p>Hungry People in Twenty-Three Countries are Crying Out for Food</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to authoritative sources, twenty-three countries have requested rice in the second quarter of this year, totaling more than two million tons, but the amount of rice that can be obtained is estimated to be only 500,000 tons. From this, we can know how difficult the international grain distribution authorities are encountering as a result of the world food shortage. The Rice Committee of the United Grain Board is striving to respond to the supply and demand of rice. It is expected that the urgent meeting convened by the Food Board on Thursday will be able to answer it, and at least a portion of food can be allocated to the countries threatened by famine.</p>
<p>Hoover Criticized for Using it as a Political Tool</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] The American National Citizens Political Action Committee today wrote to President Truman, requesting the dismissal of American representative Hoover, who is investigating the famine situation in Europe. It is claimed that Hoover will use food as a weapon to attack the democratic forces in Europe. Hoover himself has not commented on this. However, according to his subordinates, after World War I, Hoover never used food relief to achieve reactionary political goals. The American Industrial Union, together with the head of the United Fish, Food, Tobacco, and Agricultural Workers Union, Henderson, also wrote to the President, saying that millions of residents in Assam starved to death because Hoover did not approve of their demand for independent democratic political activities.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] Democratic Senator Ellender, opposing loans to Britain, declared today that the U.S. now owes $279 billion, exceeding the total debt of Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia by $145 billion. The total debt of all countries in the world is only equal to that of the U.S. The area of the U.S. is equal to only one-tenth of the total area of the united nations. The united nations have ten people while the U.S. only has one, yet the united nations is seeking loans from the U.S. From this, it seems the U.S. has been harmed by progress. The U.S., for the sake of stabilizing the world economy, has already agreed to allocate nearly $10 billion to participate in the International Bank and Equalization Fund. If the U.S. lends to Britain, there will be no reason to refuse loans to the Soviet Union and France, which will inevitably cause resentment. The average debt per American citizen is $1,997, while in the British Empire it is only $161.</p>

<p>Military Police Cooperate in Apprehension: More Than Three Hundred Arrested</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Japanese police and U.S. military police arrested 300 Japanese prostitutes on the streets last night. Among them were some who originally belonged to good families, and some who are currently ordinary office workers. Almost half of the arrested women suffer from venereal diseases, and many are pregnant. These women are soliciting American soldiers near various train stations in Tokyo. Most are released after physical examination, with a warning that if they do not stop their activities, they will be imprisoned. Their ages range from sixteen to thirty-eight. Many of them came from families that were previously well-off, but were forced to engage in prostitution due to the pressure of life. Among them, several lost their parents during air raids, and there are also many who became widows due to the impact of the war. (Among them there are also widows of the *Kamikaze* squadron.) Very few prostitutes engage in this occupation. According to the police authorities, these women show no intention of "repenting," believing that since Japan has been defeated, they can do whatever they want.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Loan for Grain Merchants Approved; Can Be Fully Decided and Lending Commenced Within a Week <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Procurement Also Agreed Upon; Speculators Should Cease Their Activities</p>
<p>The loan scheme for grain merchants has been approved by the Ministry of Food. The Ministry of Food is now consulting with the Four Banks Joint Treasury on loan procedures. It is expected that all matters can be fully decided and lending commenced within this week. The total amount is 200 billion yuan, mostly to be handled by the Farmers Bank of China, with an interest rate of 3%. Yang Xizhi, the Food Administration Special Commissioner who flew to Chongqing with the loan draft five days ago for instructions, also flew back to Shanghai the night before last. As for the city's food supply, there have been abundant arrivals in recent days. Coupled with the existing reserves of more than 500,000 piculs, speculators have been alarmed by this news and are selling off their holdings.</p>
<p>Two Batches of Overseas Rice Have Arrived</p>
<p>In addition, the Food Administration authorities are preparing to purchase large quantities of food from Southeast Asia to supplement the food supply. Initial discussions have been successfully conducted by Ambassador Wellington Koo with the London Food Bureau. The Ministry of Food in Chongqing will also send a senior official to Singapore to conduct further specific discussions with relevant parties. According to news from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), UNRRA relief rice will be shipped to China in large quantities. From January to June of this year, it is estimated that a total of 209,000 tons of rice will be shipped to China. The first batch, transported by the "Niagara," containing 18,157 bags, arrived at the end of last month and has been unloaded in Kowloon. UNRRA has allocated the above rice to the Guangxi Branch and the Guangdong Branch. The second batch, carried by the "Toke Torres," with 2,143 tons, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is currently being unloaded.</p>
<p>Yang Xizhi Talks About Loan Procedures</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yang Xizhi's statement to reporters, grain merchants applying for loans must first have their qualifications examined by the Food Administration authorities and the bank, checking: (1) business history, (2) past credit, (3) facilities in the production area, and (4) transportation and sales capabilities. Only those who pass the examination can be granted loans by the national bank. The loan amount is also limited, depending on the strength of the grain merchant. For example, if they can purchase 500 piculs, then the government loan will also be for 500 piculs. If they have the capacity for 100 piculs, continuous purchasing, transportation, and sales will follow, and the rest will follow this pattern. By making the city's reserves abundant and the sources plentiful, the drop in rice prices can be expected in the near future. As for the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, with more than 300 members, whether all of them are qualified to apply for loans will be determined after further review. After the implementation of the grain merchant loan, the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office will stand in a guiding position for grain merchants and will investigate whether they have used the entire loan to purchase rice in the production area, whether the rice has been transported to Shanghai after purchase, whether it has been hoarded after arriving in Shanghai, and its source and destination. If any violation of the above situations is discovered, severe punishment will be imposed. Mr. Yang also said that the recent resurgence of rice prices in Shanghai was caused by speculators raising prices, while grain prices in the production area have not fluctuated. Therefore, after grain merchant loans are used for large-scale purchases in the production area, the speculative atmosphere in the city can be eliminated immediately.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Eleven ships of the Minsheng Shipping Company are being repaired or awaiting departure in Shanghai, including "Minzu," "Minyu," "Minquan," "Minyi," "Minkang," "Minxian," "Minzhong," "Minlian," "Mingui," "Shengcun," and "Jiangtong." "Minzu" arrived in Shanghai last month. The entire crew in Shanghai demanded an adjustment to their salaries, delaying departure. "Minyu" has been repaired. The remaining nine ships are still under repair. The company has already accepted the crew's salary principles, but the details are still being discussed. "Minzu" raised its anchor this morning and sailed to Hankou and Yichang, but there were few passengers or cargo due to the rain. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiang'an" is also scheduled to depart this afternoon, towing two iron barges and carrying a large batch of relief supplies to Hankou. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s new ship "Tek Sheng" (the previous "Tek Sheng" was destroyed in the war) was built after the war. This new ship came to China from London to participate in coastal voyages, carrying more than 300 tons of goods from the UK. It passed through Hong Kong and may arrive today. It is heard that the company has built several new ships in London, which will successively come to China to begin operations. China Navigation Company's "Jinan" is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Qingdao on Thursday, originally to carry relief supplies. Due to the small amount of relief supplies, it will load some commercial goods.</p>

<p>Property Dispute Arises Over Gresham Apartments</p>
<p>Among all the properties investigated and seized by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, a property dispute involving a value of hundreds of thousands of yuan has recently occurred. This property originally belonged to a Japanese named Kanagori Kanko, located at Gresham Apartments (1226-1238 Avenue Joffre), occupying six mu of land, and 12.52 mu along the Pingliang Road. As of June 10th, 1940, the Japanese had mortgaged the above properties to the French Shanghai First Charity Hall for 264,000 yuan in national currency, and later mortgaged 30 million yuan in Japanese currency. After the victory, all properties of Japanese expatriates in Shanghai were confiscated by our government authorities. The above property's original owner was Japanese, and therefore should be taken over by our side. However, because Kanagori Kanko used it as collateral, a dispute arose in the property rights aspect with the French Shanghai First Charity Hall. It is heard that the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau is willing to advance the full amount of the mortgage to the French First Charity Hall and confiscate the property under the management of our country. The negotiations with the French side are ongoing.</p>
<p>More Enemy and Puppet Properties Continue to be Seized</p>
<p>Also, in the recent week, the investigation team seized large amounts of enemy and puppet materials and real estate. These include: (1) more than five mu of real estate located in the Hong Kong area by Qian Dawei, the former deputy director of the puppet Central Reserve Bank; (2) a garden house with more than two mu and four fen of land in Guangzhong Road, Zhabei, owned by Japanese national Yokozawa Eishiro, and three Korean Bank drafts for 1.5 million Japanese yen; (3) ten buildings at 60-78 East Baoxing Road, Chongshun Road No. 1, and 84 Xingjiaqiao Road owned by Japanese merchant Iyose Kenzo; (4) 1,000 boxes of white pigskin of enemy materials concealed at No. 38, Qinren Lane, Avenue Haig; (5) fifty rolls of white paper in the Shanghai Jie warehouse on Daming Road.</p>

<p>Indicted on Charges of Traitor</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Xinghuai, the battalion commander of the spy team attached to the 94th Regiment of the 24th Division of the Puppet 9th Army stationed in Taixian, led more than ten people into Lingjia Village on the night of July 21 last year, under the pretext of collecting public grain, robbing every household. The residents of the village, Wang Xueguang, Tu Rongcai, Zhou Wanjiao, Wang Qin, and others, suffered considerable losses. Before leaving, Tu Rongcai was tied up and taken away, extorting 100 dan of wheat to redeem him. After repeated discussions, a total of 76 dan of wheat were paid, and he was released after 32 days of detention. Wang Xinghuai committed many crimes and also set fire to Zhaojiazhuang to rob, causing three people to jump into the river and die. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai for fear of punishment. Coincidentally, Tu Rongcai also came to Shanghai to visit his cousin Tu Yuzhang and met Wang Xinghuai unexpectedly in a teahouse. He called the police and Wang was arrested by the police station, transferred to the garrison headquarters, and then to the high prosecutor's office for investigation, and indicted on charges of traitor. The case was heard in the criminal court of the High Court yesterday morning by Judge Cao Jun. The defendant firmly denied ever having held a puppet position or committing robbery, claiming only to have worked in the township office. Tu Rongcai, Zhou Wanjiao, Tu Heyun, and others each stated the details of the events. The court ordered Wang Xinghuai to be detained for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Water and Lumber Industry Labor Dispute Under Mediation; City Government Orders Detailed Investigation <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Gas Company Labor Strike Concludes with Agreement Yesterday</p>
<p>Amidst the ongoing labor dispute in the city's water and lumber industry, an unfortunate incident occurred where a member of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Shanghai North District Defense Corps shot and injured civilians. The deceased were identified as striking workers Zhu Jinfu and Zhang Chunsheng. Yesterday afternoon, worker representatives Xin Ruiding and Zhu Qichang, among others, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request mediation. The wages of workers in this industry are mostly calculated on a daily basis, amounting to 1,050 yuan in national currency per day, with meals provided by the employers, but the workers are responsible for providing their own tools. They are now demanding an increase in wages to 6,300 yuan in national currency per day, with meals still provided by the employers and tools remaining their own responsibility. However, employers did not send representatives to the bureau yesterday, so formal negotiations could not be held. According to Director Li Jianhua of the Labor Factory, regarding the shooting incident, the General Defense Corps and the Garrison Command will naturally investigate and handle the matter according to the law, as it is not within the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau. As for the labor dispute, the bureau will immediately begin mediation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the municipal government has strictly ordered the General Headquarters of the Defense Corps to thoroughly investigate the incident and instructed that the perpetrators be detained and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for legal action.</p>
<p>Defense Headquarters Releases Account</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, an unfortunate incident occurred at Zhabei Road the day before yesterday afternoon. According to a report by Wang Binyan, Commander of the Shanghai North District Corps, and after investigation by Nie Yuehan, staff officer of the General Headquarters, the cause of the incident was that around 2:00 PM the day before, mud workers went on strike. It happened that one worker was still working at the Public Safety Lane on Zhabei Road, and was seen by other striking workers, who went forward to stop him. Wan Guozhang, the acting head of the lane (and a member of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Shanghai North District Defense Corps), discovered this and stepped forward to mediate, causing a misunderstanding. The workers broke the lane head's head, causing him to bleed profusely. Wan argued with them, and the entanglement reached the Public Safety Lane squad headquarters. Deputy Adjutant He Senkun of the District Corps was also on the scene and mediated from the side. As a result, workers from the Xinguang Underwear Factory lined up and persuaded the troublemaking workers, a Mr. Shen and Zhu Genlin, to return, which could have resolved the matter. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM, more than a thousand workers suddenly swarmed and surrounded the squad headquarters, demanding that Shen and Zhu be handed over. The Deputy Adjutant told them that they had already been persuaded to return to the Xinguang Factory, but they claimed not to believe it. They first destroyed the sentry box and doors and windows, creating a threatening atmosphere, shouting "Hand over your weapons!" "Charge in!" and "Open fire!". The guard, Han Wencheng, seeing the disparity in numbers, had no choice but to retreat inside the door. The crowd continued to roar and harass him. In self-defense, Han fired a warning shot into the air, but unexpectedly, as he pulled the trigger, a rioter jumped forward and was killed. The General Headquarters, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the Special Task Force to work with the police and military police to maintain order and handle the aftermath. The General Headquarters has now submitted a detailed report on the incident to the Songhu Garrison Command for review and has ordered the squad to detain the involved corps member, Han Wencheng, pending further investigation.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The labor strike at the city's ten major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, New World, and The Sun, has ended after mediation from various parties. It has been decided that the highest minimum wage for employees will be 60 yuan, calculated based on the cost of living index. The bloody conflict at Wing On will be resolved through legal channels. Thus, the labor strike that had been deadlocked for many days has come to an end. All companies resumed business yesterday morning.</p>
<p>[Our Report] There has been no progress in the Commercial Press labor strike case. The Shanghai management and board of directors of the press have telegraphed General Manager Wang Yunwu in Chongqing for instructions.</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Shanghai Gas Company has been resolved after multiple mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau. An agreement was reached yesterday, with the following key points: (1) Full-time workers will work eight hours per day, with Saturday afternoons and Sundays off. (2) Wages will be paid as usual during holidays. Workers who work during holidays will be paid double their wages. Four days off will be given for the Lunar New Year; if working, the wages will be tripled. (3) Annual bonuses will be paid as stipulated by the government. (4) Wages will be paid on a 30-day basis, abolishing the 26-day system. (5) Employee savings will be paid as follows: employees who resign before 12 years of service will receive 5%; those who resign after 12 years of service will receive 7.5%; those who resign after 12 years of service and are over 50 years old will receive 10%. (6) Medical expenses for employee illnesses will be borne by the company. (7) Wages and subsidies will be adjusted according to the cost of living index issued by the municipal government.</p>

<p>Qiu Changjiang, Zhang Xuekui, Peng Shaogan, and other representatives of the British Tramway Company's employees, were reported by Cai Fengshan, Wang Helin, Gu Xiu, and ten others from the same company for searching for patriotic elements and conducting anti-British and anti-American activities on behalf of the enemy during the enemy's occupation. After receiving the report, the Garrison Command immediately arrested them and sent them to court. The following facts have been released by the Songhu Garrison Command: (1) Bai Wengui, an unemployed worker at the company, worked underground after Shanghai fell. Qiu and others repeatedly attempted to harm him but failed. After the victory, Bai was given a certificate of reinstatement. Bai Wengui asked the union to restore his position, and Qiu and others said, "What's the use of your underground work? You still have to come to us." (2) Qiu and others exerted the most effort in the anti-British and anti-American movement during the enemy's occupation. They also spoke up for the enemy to prevent underground activities, forced workers to register, and obtained worker rosters and fingerprints to prevent workers' underground activities. (3) During the enemy's occupation, Qiu and others assisted the enemy in searching for identification documents hidden by patriotic elements. Receipts for donations of winter clothes to soldiers at the front and a letter from Chairman Chiang to the national public found in the homes of company workers numbered 283 and 390 were searched and taken away, and they were threatened. (4) If unemployed workers requested the union to arrange employment, Qiu and others demanded tips, extorting 50,000 yuan from each person. (5) Zhu Yongye, Wu Shusheng, Zhu Baolong, Liu Xingshun, Jin Guoxiang, Jiang Hetong, Jin Dalin, Ji Zhihe, Wang Jianhua, Wang Yan, Zang Zhicheng, Wang Chang'an, Xu Jinyou, and others were all accomplices of Qiu and others, assisting them in collaborating with the enemy and committing all kinds of evils.</p>

<p>One thousand and eight Japanese military policemen imprisoned in the Japanese-Chinese Textile Factory prisoner-of-war camp in western Shanghai controlled the entire Shanghai intelligence work during the enemy's occupation of Shanghai, set up ten dens of evil, wantonly arrested innocent compatriots, and inflicted cruel torture, resulting in countless deaths. Their crimes are too numerous to count. After the 23rd Regiment of our military police took over the defense of Shanghai, they began to register the crimes of the Japanese military police. As of yesterday, they had received over 350 complaints from citizens, not including the victims of over a thousand martyred comrades from the Martyred Comrades Association and underground workers.</p>
<p>Scalding Legs with Corrosive Liquid</p>
<p>The crimes reported include: (1) murder, (2) torture, (3) rape, (4) wanton destruction of property, and (5) robbery. The criminals are mostly senior special police officers from the Japanese military police, especially Takahashi Beifu of the Northern Shanghai Branch and Takeda Sadamu of the Western Shanghai Branch, against whom there are even more complaints. Takahashi, nicknamed "Hound," is extremely vicious. Many arrested compatriots had their legs scalded with corrosive liquid, leaving them disabled. In addition, our military police regiment has found evidence of crimes committed by more than 100 Japanese military officers and soldiers. These 100-plus Japanese military officers and soldiers will be interrogated separately in the coming days by the military law officer of the military police regiment. The victims will also be summoned to court for identification and confrontation. Those whose crimes are confirmed after interrogation will be prosecuted by the military prosecutor and sent to the military court or high court, which will be established on the 15th, for trial and sentencing.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Prisoners Reorganized into Ten Squads</p>
<p>The 20th Military Police Regiment, which is responsible for managing the Japanese military police prisoners in the Shanghai area, has now reorganized the Japanese military police into ten squads, with the officers formed into a separate squad for easier control. They are: the Xinshijie Military Police Branch reorganized as the First Squad, the Western Shanghai Military Police as the Second Squad, the Waterway Yangshupu area Military Police as the Third Squad, the Northern Shanghai Branch as the Fourth Squad, the Railway Police (i.e., train protection unit) as the Fifth Squad, the Pudong Branch as the Sixth Squad, the Southern Shanghai Branch as the Seventh Squad, the Special High Command as the Eighth Squad, the Jiading Nanhui Branch as the Ninth Squad, and the Eastern Shanghai Branch as the Tenth Squad. It is hoped that citizens throughout the city will report the crimes of the Japanese military police to the regiment as soon as possible, so that the Japanese military police who acted lawlessly and committed all kinds of evil can be brought to justice without anyone escaping.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Building a Navy is More Than Just Lamenting "Lack of Talent"; Comments from Deputy Director Zhou of the Naval Office: Need for Massive Capital and Self-reliance in Creating Heavy Industry, Dispatching Personnel for Training, and Receiving Vessels Donated by the UK and US <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Xianzhang, Deputy Director of the Naval Office of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 9th. Our reporter made a special visit yesterday afternoon, and Mr. Zhou spoke in detail about the situation of our country's navy. Regarding the reconstruction of the navy, although it is being actively carried out, the specific methods still need to be planned in the long term with naval advisors after the establishment of the US military advisory group to China. According to Mr. Zhou, building a navy is definitely not something that can be accomplished in three to five years. Not only should the construction of the navy itself be emphasized, but other equipment is also very important. For example, the construction of warships, ports, materials, and equipment should be developed equally. Furthermore, since new-style warships now use oil, and our country's oil production is extremely low, we still need to discover oil fields and establish oil factories. Problems such as these require massive capital and self-reliance in establishing heavy industry. And the lack of talent is the biggest difficulty. Although there is assistance from countries such as the UK and the US, with ships being donated, we cannot use them at all without talent. And relying on aid from other countries is not a long-term solution. Minister Chen Cheng is extremely concerned about cultivating naval talent and is determined to improve naval treatment and raise the standards of soldiers. Mr. Zhou expressed his hope that China could also imitate countries such as the UK and the US and hold a "Navy Week" every year, mooring warships in various ports for citizens to openly visit, arousing the interest of the general youth in the navy, and on the other hand, sailing warships to places where overseas Chinese reside, so that overseas Chinese can also engage in naval work.</p>
<p>A Small Number of Personnel Returning After Completing Studies</p>
<p>Naval training is divided into basic and practical work. Practical training is now being conducted at Qingniao, and in the future, it is planned to establish naval schools and company camps along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to implement basic training. There are currently about 1,000 naval personnel training in the United States and about 370 in the United Kingdom. Among them, a small number of personnel have completed their studies and returned home to work. The United States has donated eight warships to our country, now in Cuba. The largest of these is about 1,700 tons, including two destroyers, two torpedo boats, and four minesweepers. Several hundred ship reception personnel went to the United States last year, and after training is completed, they will sail the ships to China by the end of June of this year. The United Kingdom has also donated 13 warships to us, one of which will be sailed to China by trained personnel by the end of April. Training in the UK is done in batches, that is, after one ship's training is completed and handed over, another ship's training is started. The third batch of personnel to be trained recently arrived in the UK. The naval personnel training in Qingdao are supplied with landing craft by the US naval authorities, and are taught on a one-officer, one-teacher basis, creating specialized personnel. There is one class per month with 15 officers and 150 soldiers. Four classes have now been established, and the training period is determined by performance. After the training is completed, the landing craft will be handed over. The first class can be completed by the end of April.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Received Severely Damaged</p>
<p>As for the Japanese warships received, repairs are now being stepped up, as the ships left by the defeated Japanese army are severely damaged, and most are unusable. Mr. Zhou said that the small ships being received should be repaired separately at the coastal ports, and should not all be concentrated in Shanghai, resulting in uneven distribution and prolonged time.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Shipyard to Be Expanded</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard will be expanded. The representatives who went to the UK for inspection have now returned to the country and will soon begin planning.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou hosted a banquet in Shanghai for Captain Will, the US Navy officer in charge of training, asking him to do his best to assist in the training of Chinese naval personnel. Mr. Cheng returned to the United States on the 10th. Mr. Zhou also invited General Anastin, the captain of the British warship, to lunch yesterday to discuss everything. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Nanjing today.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Miki Tsuyoshi, Who Abused American Soldiers in the Shenyang Concentration Camp, Tried for the First Time; Nine Counts of Crimes with Supporting Letters <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Miki Tsuyoshi, the former administrator of the American military concentration camp near Shenyang, was tried for the first time yesterday in a US military court. After Japan's surrender, he hid with his wife in Hongkou, Shanghai, until his arrest this spring. The Shenyang concentration camp housed 1,200 American soldiers, including 200 American soldiers and sailors, some of whom died due to various influences.</p>
<p>Miki Tsuyoshi was brought into the courtroom by military police at 9:00 AM yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer presented nine counts of crimes and submitted several letters from American prisoners of war in the concentration camp as evidence, describing Miki Tsuyoshi's crimes. According to them, William Jones was a</p>
<p>very Iranian</p>
<p>person when he was detained in the concentration camp. The Japanese ordered him to do hard labor. One day, when William Jones finished working, he received fifteen packs of Chinese cigarettes from a northeastern Chinese man who sympathized with him. The Japanese soldiers found the cigarettes on his body and asked him where the cigarettes came from. Jones did not want to involve others and refused to reveal the name of the person who gave him the cigarettes. Miki Tsuyoshi continued to beat Jones with a stick for four hours to make him "tell the truth." He beat him again in the same way the next day. It was winter, and the temperature in Shenyang was below zero. Jones was</p>
<p>scantily clad</p>
<p>confined to a dark room with only a wool blanket to keep him warm. He suffered a serious illness due to the beatings and died in the hospital four days later from hunger and cold. Miki Tsuyoshi falsely claimed to the public that Jones died of pneumonia, but in reality, he died due to unbearable abuse. The letters of testimony described Miki Tsuyoshi's cruelty in detail. The court adjourned at 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, American medical officer Miller testified, explaining the causes and consequences of pneumonia. The defendant's lawyer wanted to prove that Jones died of pneumonia, while the plaintiff's lawyer wanted to explain that Jones' death was largely due to being beaten and catching a cold, which led to pneumonia. Therefore, Miki Tsuyoshi</p>
<p>cannot shirk responsibility</p>
<p>Secondly, there was a witness letter recounting the miserable conditions in the concentration camp and Miki Tsuyoshi's violent behavior of beating people at every turn, and listing the names of those who were abused. Miki Tsuyoshi sat silently in the defendant's seat. Although he was listening to the details of his crimes, he showed no shame. The case may be sentenced this Wednesday. The Doolittle Raid victim case may be delayed by a day or two because the witnesses have not yet arrived.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Basketball League Results Yesterday: Saco Wins Against Shantou Team, Renyu Defeats Zhongyi Effortlessly, Qianghua Loses to Xueqing <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's basketball league, Xueqing in the women's Group 10 surprisingly reversed their previous decline against Qinglian, displaying great power. Cao Meifeng's agility stood out, leading the entire court. They ultimately defeated Qianghua with a score of 40 to 23. In the first half, Xueqing also took the lead with a score of 17 to 14. In Group A2, Renyu played against Zhongyi. In the first half, the two sides were evenly matched, with a score of 13 to 11, Renyu only leading by one point. In the second half, Renyu's Yao Wenyuan consistently scored, and the score steadily increased, ultimately winning against Zhongyi with a score of 44 to 25. In the last match of Group A1, Saco played against Shantou. The absence of Ma Canxi and Chen Weiguang, who had not returned from Shanghai, had a significant impact. Saco still held the ambition to win the championship and launched a full-scale attack. From the start of the match, Saco consistently led. The first half ended with a score of 37 to 24, Saco winning. In the second half, the situation remained the same. Shantou could only follow the lead. The final score was 72 for Saco and 56 for Shantou, a difference of eight points.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Highest Institution of Learning Standing on the Plateau of Xikang: National Xikang Institute of Technology [Part Two] <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Jin</p>
<p>Of course, a newly established school is always less perfect than one with a history, but thanks to Dr. Li's reputation and perseverance, everything was finally put in order and everything was on track.</p>
<p>Overall View of the Campus</p>
<p>The campus is located on Lushan Mountain, seven kilometers outside the city. Classrooms and dormitories are housed in temples on the mountain, facing the water, with a vast "Qionghai Lake" on the opposite side, a lake and swamp covering fifty or sixty kilometers around. According to local legends, Qionghai Lake was once a large city during the Han Dynasty, but it sank due to an earthquake. The surroundings of the lake are bare mountains. Xichang City is located at its southwest end. Near the mountain, the scenery is very elegant. Sometimes, a small boat drifts on the calm water surface, creating a detached atmosphere.</p>
<p>With such conditions, faculty, equipment, and environment, "Xikang Institute of Technology" seemed to be eligible to be converted into a university, because there was no university in Xikang. Therefore, in the summer of 1940, Dr. Li, unafraid of the long journey, went to Chongqing to negotiate with the authorities to convert it into a university, but to no avail. When he returned to the school, he sorrowfully reported the news of the failure to hundreds of young people with high hopes, and everything changed and everything was in decline.</p>
<p>Dr. Li Leaves the School</p>
<p>In 1941, Dr. Li left the school and resigned from the position of president. His successor was Dr. Zong Dahuan, who was also the dean of studies at Beiyang Institute of Technology and Xikang Institute of Technology. Although he was an experienced school administrator, under the circumstances at that time, he could only maintain the status quo. The professors who came with Dr. Li left with him, and he could only hire another group. In 1942, in the midst of difficulties, a six-year medical department was added. He planned to first establish the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and engineering, and then request the authorities to convert it into a university, but this effort was like clouds in the sky, lightly blown away to Utopia.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1943, Dr. Zhou fell ill in Chongqing, and the school affairs were jointly managed by the three directors of academic affairs, general affairs, and student affairs. At this time, the school had reached the end of its rope. Professors and students left the school in large numbers, and the life of the school was in grave danger, like a bird in a storm, which could be destroyed at any time.</p>
<p>New President Takes Office</p>
<p>In the spring of 1944, the fate of "Xikang Institute of Technology" seemed to have taken a turn for the better. The new president, Mr. Lei Zuowen (also an old general of Beiyang Institute of Technology, a metallurgist), arrived at the school. The students held a welcoming ceremony, pouring out their grievances like children who had lost their nanny. "Xikang Institute of Technology" was like a desolate garden, which now had a diligent and hardworking gardener.</p>
<p>As a result of two years of diligent cultivation, everything was on track. Flowers full of vitality and fruits that were firm and plump were presented to us. "Xikang Institute of Technology" was revived. Everyone in the school shouted such a sentence in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, the good news of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War finally spread to distant Xichang. After being away from home for eight years, who wouldn't want to return home to visit relatives? However, 70% of the teachers and students of "Xikang Institute of Technology" are from other provinces. This troubled the president and saddened the hearts of teachers and students from other provinces. Today, everyone is still waiting anxiously for the authorities' decision.</p>
<p>Xichang, this heavenly kingdom in the borderland, has abundant resources, beautiful scenery, and a warm climate, but it lacks culture, transportation, and, more importantly, strong law and order, and far-sighted policies. With the end of the war, "Xikang Institute of Technology" is in such an environment, and its future is not very optimistic. This autumn, busy with repatriation, the source of teachers and students is an even greater problem!</p>

<h3 id="e103">Glimmers of Hope in the Shadows: Looking at the Northwest from Lanzhou <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bingzi of this Newspaper, Lanzhou, Sent on March 3rd</p>
<p>The ice bridge on the Yellow River has thawed, and the God of Spring has begun to descend on Lanzhou. After the Spring Festival, the prices in the Lanzhou market, which had suddenly risen sharply, have gradually fallen in recent days. Gold has fallen from 170,000 yuan per tael to 130,000 yuan. Rice has fallen from 46,000 yuan per picul to 40,000 yuan, and wheat has fallen from 22,000 yuan per picul to 17,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Looking at the Northwest from Lanzhou, we see a struggle for survival amidst turmoil and a quest for progress amidst stability. The future is a bright prospect, but the present is a dark and struggling plight.</p>
<p>A Recent View of Gansu</p>
<p>In fact, the prospects for Gansu are worth aspiring to. Although it does not have many heavy industrial raw materials, petroleum is its greatest treasure. Yumen Oil Mine is already famous throughout the country, and recently, large oil layers have been discovered near Lanzhou. It may become "China's oil depot" in the future.</p>
<p>After the Bao-Tian Railway, which historically extended into Gansu for the first time, was opened to traffic, the Tian-Lan Railway is also being expedited by the provincial government. Recently, all sectors in Xinjiang have been calling for the construction of the Gan-Xin Railway. In terms of highways, the Xi(an)-Lan Road, the Gan-Ning Road, the Gan-Qing Road, and the Gan-Xin Road all have or will serve their greatest purpose during the Anti-Japanese War and the future reconstruction period. In the future, when the Bao(tou)-Ning(xia) Railway is completed, and can be extended to Lanzhou, coupled with the opening of the Eurasian air transportation, Gansu will be, as former U.S. Vice President Wallace said, the center of world transportation. But at present, it is caught in a situation of disaster and the gradual depletion of talent.</p>
<p>The Lanzhou Survey Team of the National Hydropower Engineering General Office has departed for Sangyuan Gorge in the downstream Lanzhou County of the Yellow River to conduct a survey. The team originally planned to complete the survey in one year, but now that American engineer Sacvan will come to China this autumn, it has been decided to complete the hydropower survey by September.</p>
<p>The Lanzhou Daily, organized by the Gansu Branch of the Youth Corps, will be published on Youth Day. After the publication of this newspaper, there will be a total of four daily newspapers here.</p>
<p>Last year, the province had a poor harvest, and the disaster situation was serious. The urgent problems of spring plowing seeds and the people's food in the transition period are being taken seriously by all parties.</p>
<p>Industrial Struggles</p>
<p>After Chairman Gu Zhenglun went to Chongqing, he will strive at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to start the construction of the Da-Lan Railway this spring. The main purpose is to use the construction cost of 4 billion yuan to carry out the program of relief through labor.</p>
<p>After the victory, some technical personnel in Gansu successively participated in the repatriation work. As a result, Gansu's only industries were either stagnating or closing down. Even the Yumen Oil Mine has been greatly affected, and its oil production has been sharply reduced. In short, Gansu, whether it is people's livelihood industry or anything else, is struggling this year.</p>
<p>Ningxia and Qinghai</p>
<p>Under the governance of two famous Muslim generals, Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, Ningxia and Qinghai have been good examples of seeking progress in stability for many years. Politically, there may be some places that are not "democratic" enough, but Ningxia's water conservancy, household registration, and land administration, and Qinghai's road construction and afforestation, have all been very successful. Qinghai can only be reached by the Gan-Qing Highway, and Ningxia can only be reached by the Ping(liang)-Ning, Ning-Sui(yuan) roads, and the Lan-Ning Road completed a few years ago. Due to the underdeveloped transportation, people from outside are unwilling to enter, and people from inside rarely come out. Therefore, we are willing to call out the slogans of "Transportation First" and "Talent First" on behalf of the two provinces of Ningxia and Qinghai.</p>
<p>Suiyuan After the Calamity</p>
<p>Suiyuan—the province that was famous for the Battle of Bailingmiao before the July 7th Incident—became famous again after the victory because it was besieged by the Communist army. Although Guihua and Baotou were relieved in December last year, the supply of food and coal has become the biggest problem in the province. Currently, it is the province with the highest cost of living in the country. Flour costs 500 yuan per catty, and coal costs 80 yuan per catty. If the Ping-Sui Railway can be unblocked in the future, Suiyuan's coal and iron—according to Japanese investigation reports, it ranks second in the country after the Northeast—will make the greatest contribution to the reconstruction of the country. Moreover, Suiyuan, west of the Yellow River where there are more benefits than harm, can provide a large number of immigrants. However, all of this requires the strength of the country to develop and organize.</p>
<p>An Overview of Xinjiang</p>
<p>The resources and importance of Xinjiang do not need to be explained by the reporter. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, Xinjiang has been in constant war. After 1932, Sheng Shicai used a policy of terror to rule Xinjiang for more than ten years, but after he left Xinjiang, the so-called "Ili Incident" broke out. Because of this incident, many of our national soldiers and officials and civilians in Xinjiang were sacrificed. Last winter, after Minister Zhang Zhizhong went to Xinjiang to mediate, this turmoil seemed to subside. Generally, people believed that there would never be any unfortunate incidents again, but recently there have still been rumors of "Kazakhs" causing new disturbances. The official has not confirmed what exactly is going on, and no one can figure it out.</p>
<p>Standing at the post of working in the Northwest, the reporter would like to call on the people of the country to pay attention to the Northwest again. After the independence of Outer Mongolia, the Northwest has become the front line of national defense. At the same time, not only the Northeast is our lifeline, but Xinjiang is also our lifeline. How to maintain or develop this lifeline requires more patriots from all over the country to come to the Northwest! (Sent on March 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Returning from Taiwan <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>—Sent by Weiming</p>
<p>Reported by this newspaper on the 6th</p>
<p>Taiwan, which had been occupied for a long time, has returned to the embrace of the motherland after the enemy's surrender. This is China's glory and the Taiwanese compatriots' fortune. After 50 years of Japanese management, Taiwan has made significant achievements in agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, finance, education, industry, hospitals, and other areas, as far as the reporter has observed. However, the enemy's exploitation of the Taiwanese compatriots was too severe during peacetime, so the people's livelihood was very painful, and there was no freedom to speak of. This time, the government sent personnel to take over and liberate them, which was greatly welcomed by the Taiwanese compatriots. However, after being in Taiwan for several months, the reporter deeply felt that there were several crises lurking, and had to report them to the people of the country and urge the authorities to pay attention, so that they could be used as a lesson for future governance:</p>
<p>The Burden of Living Has Increased 30 Times Compared to Before</p>
<p>(1) Four months ago, when the reporter first set foot on the island, the price of rice was only one Taiwan dollar per catty. Now, it has risen to thirty Taiwan dollars per catty, which means that the people's burden of living has increased 30 times compared to before. Therefore, the factories in Taiwan, like those in the mainland, are having labor strikes every day, requesting wage increases. In order to统筹办理, the local government did not allow any factory to increase wages individually, which led to increasingly fierce disputes. Some workers even took the opportunity to beat Japanese factory managers to vent their old grievances. If these labor strikes are not quelled as soon as possible, they will not be good for the local area.</p>
<p>The Newly Assigned Supervisors Will Have Difficulty Seeing and Hearing Everything</p>
<p>(2) Before the takeover of Taiwan, there were 20,000 Japanese civil servants. This time, the Chinese government sent less than 2,000 civil servants to take over, including technical personnel. As a result, except for a few public utilities, such as the railway, which have been taken over, the remaining factories can only send supervisors (all management within the factories is still done by Japanese people). Often, one person has to supervise several factories (the most being one person supervising nine factories). A person's energy is limited, and their ears and eyes cannot see and hear everything. Think about whether this kind of supervision work is effective. Moreover, the Japanese, seeing that their local economy is gradually recovering, are all thinking of leaving Taiwan and returning to their country. How our country will take over various enterprises in Taiwan in the future is a serious problem.</p>
<p>Employees Complain About the Difficulty of Supporting Their Families</p>
<p>(3) It is said that the civil servants sent by the government to take over Taiwan can be paid 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month for household expenses in the mainland. They can also receive 2,300 Taiwan dollars per month in Taiwan. Of these 2,300 Taiwan dollars, the government allows each person to exchange 1,000 yuan for 30,000 yuan in national currency (i.e., one Taiwan dollar for 30 yuan in national currency) to be sent home to subsidize household expenses. However, now each person in Taiwan needs at least 30 Taiwan dollars per meal. The mere 2,300 yuan is only enough to barely support one person's life in Taiwan. How can they save money to send home? Moreover, the 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in national currency mentioned above has just received a payment notice for January for each family member because the procedures of government agencies are cumbersome and slow.</p>
<p>There is a Severe Shortage of Talent, and the Remuneration Needs to be Increased</p>
<p>At this time of soaring prices, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan two months ago could still buy four or five piculs of rice in Shanghai, but now it can only buy one picul or a few dou of rice. Isn't this a big discount in disguise? No wonder a civil servant recently committed suicide out of grief because his family in the mainland could not make ends meet! Taiwan is in dire need of talent, and our government should encourage people to go there to serve. How to improve or increase their remuneration is an urgent matter that the authorities must pay close attention to.</p>

<p>Caption: Students from all over the world studying in the United States, in the "Internal Combustion Engine Laboratory" of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, studying the general appearance of motor compressors. The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University is the largest department in American universities. Students from all over the world flock there to study. The university is built on Manhattan Island, with a total of sixty-nine giant buildings, and most of New York City also spans this island. Columbia University was chartered by King George II of England and built in 1754, when the United States was still in the development stage of colonial status. Its scientific research and academic program standards are known to the world. Every year, 30,000 students attend lectures, and there are a total of 3,000 professors, instructors, and staff. During the war against Germany and Japan, the American Navy used its laboratories, classrooms, and dormitories to train thousands of naval technicians. Every few months, many naval officers graduated from Columbia University. Now that peace has arrived, Columbia University is preparing to expand its scope of teaching and make further progress.

<h3 id="e106">The Great Artery of Democratic Politics: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>On the path towards political democratization, our government is currently meticulously formulating various concrete plans and schemes for implementing democracy. The selection of candidates for provincial, municipal, and county councilors has been gradually decided. The following information pertains to the operational practices of the House of Representatives, a major political institution of the United States of America, the world's only powerful democratic ally. It is provided for reference and is urgently being published. - Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Composed of Individuals from All Walks of Life, Lawyers Predominating</p>
<p>Tracing back to the founding of the United States, its initial Congress was composed of representatives from various professions, with lawyers consistently holding a majority. According to a survey by the American Political Science Association, it was announced that during the 78th Congress (1943-1945), out of 531 members of both houses (96 senators and 435 representatives), 309 had served as lawyers. In addition, there were 56 businessmen, 33 journalists or publishers, 23 educators, 16 agricultural experts, 1 broker, and 1 housewife.</p>
<p>The average age of senators was 59, while that of representatives was 51. The average age of American voters was 41. The average educational attainment of members of Congress was higher than that of the average American citizen. Women voters accounted for more than half of the adult voters in the United States, yet in the 78th Congress, women held only 1.5% of the seats.</p>
<p>Members Receive Meager Allowances, Free Postage</p>
<p>The Constitution stipulates that senators and representatives shall receive compensation. It was not until 1855 that members were allowed to receive meager allowances. In 1855, the annual salary for senators and representatives was $3,000. It increased to $5,000 in 1865, $7,500 in 1907, and $10,000 in 1925. The annual salary for the speakers of both houses and the president pro tempore of the Senate (the Vice President serves as the permanent chairman of the Senate, and when vacant, a senator is elected to fill the position) was $15,000. Travel allowances were calculated based on the round-trip mileage between the member's residence and Washington, D.C. The annual allowance for staff was $9,500, and the allowance for stationery was $300. In addition, members of Congress were entitled to free postage.</p>
<p>Each Represents 30,000 People, Number of Seats Increasing</p>
<p>The Constitution stipulates that the number of representatives in the House of Representatives should not exceed the principle of one representative for every 30,000 people; the population of each state is calculated according to the number of voters, plus four-fifths of the non-voting population.</p>
<p>In the first Congress, there were 65 representatives. For over a century, Congress has passed bills to adjust the number of seats after each census, increasing the basic number represented by each member. As a result, the number of states has increased (adding a total of 48 members), and the rapid population growth of each state has increased the number of representatives to 435. During the 1920 census, it was announced that the number of seats should be adjusted urgently, and the number of seats for eleven states should be reduced. However, until 1929, no new decision was made, so during this period, there were actually no new members added to the House of Representatives. In 1929, Congress passed a bill that stipulated that the number of representatives should be adjusted according to the population figures of each state based on the 1930 census, and the number of seats should be adjusted according to the census figures each time. The number of seats in the House remains at 435.</p>
<p>After the Speaker of the House is Sworn in at the Opening Session of Congress, Members Cannot be Removed from Office During their Term, Except in Cases of Death, Resignation, or Expulsion by a Two-Thirds Vote</p>
<p>Speaker's Powers Weakened, Elected by Majority Party</p>
<p>The Constitution states: "The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers." The Speaker and other officers are usually selected from the majority party in the House and decided by a vote at the first meeting. After the Speaker is sworn in, he also represents the body of representatives in taking the oath.</p>
<p>Actual circumstances and tradition make the Speaker extremely important in Congress. Although the "reforms" of 1910-1911 weakened the Speaker's powers, his importance remains undiminished. The Speaker convenes meetings, recognizes members' right to speak, cites meeting laws, signs bills passed by Congress, addresses, joint meeting sub-motions, and decrees, etc.</p>
<p>His personal power is still great, but in practice, important motions are sub-decided by the majority party. One complete opposite between the U.S. House of Representatives and the British House of Commons is that the Speaker of the House still frankly leans towards his own party, and his party is often the majority party in the House. However, he must be absolutely impartial. Although the Speaker retains the right to vote, he rarely uses it unless there is an impasse.</p>
<p>The "reforms" of 1910-1911 deprived the Speaker of the power to appoint any House committee and made him lose the power to serve as chairman of the important Rules Committee.</p>
<p>The opening procedures of the Senate are also stipulated in the Constitution. The procedures should be based on the existing regulations adopted in the early days of Congress and Jefferson's Rules of Order. Jefferson's Rules of Order were drafted by Vice President Jefferson during his tenure as Chairman of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. Many articles of these rules are now adopted by Congress. The congressional rules and regulations issued at the opening of each Congress include the Constitution, statutes, and Jefferson's Rules.</p>
<p>Various Committee Systems Perform New Tasks</p>
<p>The congressional committee system began during the presidency of Washington. This system was repeatedly expanded during the presidency of Jefferson (1801-1809). Both the Senate and the House have standing and special committees. U.S. President Wilson, the 27th president, said: "The Congress in the committee hearing room is the Congress performing its tasks."</p>
<p>After the expansion of the committee system, the number of standing committees of Congress increased to 61 in 1927, and was reduced to 47 after reorganization. Among the most important are: (1) the Ways and Means Committee (responsible for collecting national taxes); (2) the Appropriations Committee (responsible for national expenditures); (3) the Judiciary Committee; (4) the Banking and Currency Committee; (5) the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee; (6) the Rivers and Harbors Committee; (7) the Agriculture and Forestry Committee; (8) the Labor Committee; (9) the Military Affairs Committee; (10) the Naval Affairs Committee; (11) the Public Lands Committee; and (12) the Rules Committee.</p>
<p>Number of Members on Standing Committees Variable, Usually Twenty-One</p>
<p>The number of members on standing committees ranges from two to forty-three, but is usually twenty-one. Representatives can serve on three committees, but representatives working on important committees rarely serve on other committees.</p>
<p>Committee members are decided by the House according to a list provided by a selection committee composed of a majority party. The average number of members of the majority party is determined by the selection committee representing the majority party. In the 79th Congress, there were 243 Democratic representatives, 190 Republican representatives, and several representatives from other two minority parties (including at least 22 American Labor Party representatives, the same as another larger party).</p>
<p>The average number of Democratic and Republican members on each committee is 60% and 40%, respectively. The number of seats for other minority party members is also determined by the number of representatives from that party.</p>
<p>The chairman of each committee is usually appointed from among the majority party members. The chairman is selected from among the majority party members of the committee.</p>
<p>Each committee has a specific meeting place in the Capitol. Some important committees often have scheduled meeting times, mostly in the morning before Congress convenes at noon. Committees cannot hold meetings during congressional sessions. Committee members can conduct their own research on congressional recess bills, or special subcommittees can discuss them. Major special committees of the House in the 78th Congress included the Committee on Post-War Economic Policy and Planning; the Committee on Post-War Military Policy; the Committee on Un-American Activities; and the Committee on Small Business Wartime Plants.</p>
<p>Important subcommittees included: the Social Security Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee; and the Loss Subcommittee of the Army Department, Treasury Department, and Post Office Department Appropriation Bills of the Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Rules Committee Agenda Bears Special Mission</p>
<p>The Rules Committee has a special mission regarding congressional meeting procedures. From 1858 to 1911, the Speaker of the House was one of the committee's ex officio members. After 1911, the Speaker left the committee, and since then, the selection of committee members has been entirely selected by each party in the House, just like other committees. The number of members of the Rules Committee increased from five to ten, then to twelve, and finally to fourteen in 1937.</p>
<p>The power of the Rules Committee lies in its ability to determine the parliamentary procedures for discussing bills. It has the right to obtain seats and speak, which means that it can interrupt another member who is speaking during the debate and rise to speak. The majority party in the Rules Committee belongs to the majority party, so the committee also cooperates with the main committees of the majority party.</p>
<p>The majority party steering committee is usually composed of more than twenty representatives, who are selected by the majority party themselves. The committee selects the bills to be discussed from the congressional agenda and prepares actions favorable to its party. The congressional agenda is jointly determined by Congress and the Rules Committee. The importance of the chairman of the steering committee is second only to the Speaker of the House.

<h3 id="e107">Still Homeless: Looking Back at Gaoyou, the Road is Long and Winding <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Sent by Tao Tao</p>
<p>Our newspaper's Zhenjiang express news on the 8th:</p>
<p>Gaoyou, a classic-style city, is located in the middle section between Zhenjiang and Huaiyin. It possesses a considerable amount of tranquility and serenity, and even has a fairly prosperous marketplace. It has always been regarded as a land of fish and rice. The annual output, just in terms of the production from the lakes and fields, occupies an important figure among the counties north of the Yangtze River. Now, looking back, it truly is:</p>
<p>Unbearable to Recall the Past</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the grain ships docked on the surface of the Grand Canal would stretch for more than ten miles. They shuttled back and forth, and in terms of transportation, there were small steamships from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin on the upper river, single-engine boats from Baoying to Gaoyou, single-engine boats from Gaoyou to Yangzhou, single-engine boats from Zhenjiang to Gaoyou, and long-distance buses from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin, which could depart in the morning and arrive in the evening. On the lower river, there were small steamships that went directly to Xinghua and Taizhou or Dongtai. In short, it was a crossroads with convenient water and land transportation. Communication facilities included state-run telegraph and telephone services, as well as provincial long-distance telephone services. The city also had electric lights and telephone installations. The people were hardworking and loyal, enjoying a life that met their needs, and living a leisurely and peaceful life. In terms of culture, there were eight complete elementary schools, one experimental elementary school, and a county-run junior high school, as well as the provincial Jieshou Rural Teachers' College and several small local newspapers. Foreign newspapers, such as Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, could be seen by the afternoon of the following day. Everything, in every way, was a prototype similar to Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. But good times don't last, and in the last ten years, it has been:</p>
<p>A Series of Unfortunate Nightmares</p>
<p>That was when the Japanese invaders moved from the Northeast War to Central China, from Shanghai to Nanjing, and finally descended upon Gaoyou, turning the entire county seat into bankruptcy. However, it soon changed its appearance, turning several streets that could not accommodate a single military vehicle into flat, wide roads that could accommodate two military vehicles side by side. Along with them came batches of national scum and traitors, with treacherous people in power and rampant rumors, creating a hell on earth, turning people who were minding their own business at home into victims of unexpected disasters. The likes of chairmen, county magistrates, and bureau chiefs were all people who relied on others for survival, only caring about their own peace and accumulation of wealth, and not caring about the grievances of the common people! They only knew that pleasing the Japanese chief was their sacred duty as chairmen, bureau chiefs, and county magistrates, and they did not care about the life and death of the people. However, in these ten years, there was a dividing line, that is, the extremely poor became rich, and the rich became poor. Comparatively, those with more skills naturally belonged to the merchants. Merchants were the darlings of the heavens during the period of occupation, with nothing being unfavorable. This was a gift of inflation. However, when:</p>
<p>The Victory Situation Unfolded</p>
<p>People were first afraid to openly spread the news. There was only private discussion in hushed tones, because the enemy was still stationed in the city. Although the overall situation was gone, it seemed like remnants still remained, and they explicitly posted notices to arrest those who spread rumors and caused trouble? Even though the 42nd puppet army division was reorganized into the 5th National Army Division, but these useless things, where could they exchange the clear matters of the nation? They only knew about transporting rice and levying donations. Speaking of transporting rice, private transportation was strictly prohibited, but the division headquarters could use small steamships to transport thousands of loads. As for donations, no store could offset the day's income with the day's donation amount. This was because buyers from the surrounding villages could not come, and three miles away from the city was the range of the Communist army. In this 34th year of the Republic, merchants lost money. On the one hand, they had to cope with massive donations, and on the other hand, prices after the victory were falling sharply. Although it did not lead to bankruptcy, they were exhausted. Similarly, since merchants felt pain, the common people did not need to be told. Especially in the scorching summer weather, after Wang Sunliangcheng of Jiangbei came to Gaoyou to inspect, he believed that the fortifications were not solid. On a whim, he ordered division commander Wang Hemin to:</p>
<p>Mobilize All the People in the City</p>
<p>The total number was about 50,000. From 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day, they had to build earth walls and dig ditches around all the temples and monasteries where troops were stationed. Each household had to send one person, making it difficult for the people to sleep and eat. If they were even slightly late, they would be whipped immediately. That kind of tragic and inhumane cruelty, even if King Zhou or Emperor Yang of Sui saw it, they would have to retreat and admit inferiority. The common people knew that this kind of defensive work was of no use, but no one dared to say anything. On the contrary, if you were accused of being in contact with the "New Fourth Army," there would be the danger of being beheaded at any time. Later, the town and village chiefs were all forced to flee. Those who could not escape sought death, causing an uproar in the city. Only then did a few gentry come out, risking their lives, to petition the division headquarters, which then changed to soldiers taking their place. However, those common people who had done the work all fell ill in the autumn, and they were all stubborn diseases. Because I couldn't afford the daily cost of hiring workers, I had a ten-year-old girl go to work for three days, and she suffered a severe illness that nearly killed her, which did not recover until the Communist army attacked the county seat. However, I was looking at this environment, and I had to jump out with tears in my eyes. Poor child! You also have democracy, and I also have democracy, and we lived such:</p>
<p>Strange Democratic Life</p>
<p>When the Communist army attacked the outskirts of Gaoyou, it was on the night of "How often do we see the moon above?". It truly did not take much effort to easily obtain it. Those costly earth walls and bunkers could be said to have no effect. Even from the perspective of the Communist army itself, it was said to not be an easy task, because the attacks on Xinghua and Yancheng took several days and nights to resolve. Moreover, there were not only three or four thousand puppet troops in Gaoyou city, but also more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. In addition, within these seven days, airplanes brought 400,000 rounds of ammunition. However, the facts were always the opposite of what most people thought. From the sound of the first bullet, it only took less than three hours to end the battle of Gaoyou County, with the entire army being wiped out, people and ghosts surrendering, and the division commander fleeing. The large batch of bullets sent by the plane were all given away because the numbers did not match. The casualties among the people were not as severe as during the occupation, but the burning of houses was unprecedented in Gaoyou. Now, let's talk about:</p>
<p>The Activities of the Communist Army Entering the City</p>
<p>The first action was to issue a notice to reassure the people, and then there were many more tricks. They held registrations for those who had served in the puppet army and self-renewal registrations for those who had worked in puppet organizations or schools. They used anti-Japanese currency, with one yuan equal to 5,000 puppet currency. Now it is said to have risen to 8,000 yuan. The rise and fall of the anti-Japanese currency is based on the rise and fall of prices, but this is not entirely true. When we first arrived in Gaoyou, the price of rice was only 400 yuan per dan, but now it has reached 700 yuan per dan. They held sham people's public trials, organized various guilds, and stipulated that stores could not close and employees could not be fired. However, the Communist army opened a large number of commercial venues. These commercial venues were all-encompassing in nature, ranging from oil, salt, cloth, paper, stationery, foreign and domestic goods, to arrowhead, eggs, and nothing was missing. Now even the water stoves have opened. I dare not say whether they are collecting taxes or not, but I only know that the first batch of troops to arrive in Gaoyou all had dialects from Zhejiang and Jiangnan, while the second batch were all from our neighboring counties of Xinghua, Dongtai, and Yanbei. The female political officers, mostly due to intellectual relations, were mostly from Jiangnan, and there were very few from the inland. As for the so-called "people's army," they were all genuine local products, and the number was impossible to estimate. There was also the so-called "Yangge dance." It is feared that all Communist soldiers understand this set of movements. It has now been promoted to penetrate deep into the civilian population, especially:</p>
<p>The General Young Women of the Surrounding Villages</p>
<p>It has become a compulsory course. Younger girls around the age of ten learn it, and older women in their thirties and forties learn to twist their butts and sway. But what about in the city? Although it has not been done yet, it has been listed as one of the regular sports in elementary schools. In the long run, this kind of drama can be spread widely. It has been almost two months since the Communist army entered the city, and the people do not seem to feel much pain. It is like a person who does not feel pain at the time after being cut with a knife, but only feels sad after the pain subsides. Therefore, when the appropriate time comes, they will all desperately flee abroad. The number of refugees stranded in the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang-Nanjing-Shanghai area is probably over 100,000. They have fled, but where do they find a place to settle? As of today, there are many people who feel that they have run out of money. Seeing that the general trend is like this, and there is no compassion from anyone, some people have launched a campaign to return home. The reason is simple and painful: it is better to die directly in one's hometown than to starve to death in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Youth members of the "Victory Corps" in a public high school in a city in the western United States are learning wartime wireless radio. The U.S. Wartime Manpower Commission announced a plan in September 1942 to organize a high school victory team, allowing the 6.5 million students in American high schools to have the opportunity to prepare for war service. First World War aviator and aviation leader Rykkenbacko was appointed chairman of the team's National Policy Committee. The victory team was also sponsored by the U.S. Army Department, the Navy Department, and the Department of Commerce. The picture shows the situation when high school students in this country are practicing wireless radio. (Qin)</p>

<p>Dire Telegram Regarding Heavy Military Burdens; Request to Postpone Tax Collection: The County Chamber of Commerce reported that the comprehensive inspection of business tax for all businesses would begin on the 11th. However, this county was invaded by the brutal enemy in November of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and all of the prosperous commercial areas, such as North Wai Street and East Main Street in the city, were burned down and have not yet recovered. The rural areas were devastated by the enemy and then harassed by bandits, suffering severe damage. On the 9th, a telegram was specially sent to the Minister of Finance and the Chairman of the Provincial Government, requesting a three-month exemption from business tax to alleviate the hardship of businesses. The native cloth industry is also requesting to follow pre-war practices, with a nationwide exemption from native cloth tax.</p>

They were even taking property or arbitrarily vandalizing things. This kind of barbaric behavior is illegal. Yesterday, they jointly issued a notice to the public stating that if anyone is confirmed to be willingly collaborating with the enemy, acting as their henchman, disturbing the local area, or extorting people by taking advantage of their power, and is hiding in the countryside, any citizen can collect evidence and report it confidentially to the county government or the court. They will certainly be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, prices have been rising frequently. Our authorities are reorganizing the Baojia system, and prices will continue to rise in the future. The people are suffering and crying out in agony. The authorities should request that items be distributed according to household registration to show fairness and avoid abuses, though they are adopting the method of selling items at reduced prices. Before distribution according to household registration, however, abuses are emerging in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Like in the past with selling salted fish, preserved meat, and sugar at reduced prices, when we go to buy them, we are often told that they are sold out. The people murmur complaints, but the authorities do not ask or listen, and no thorough investigation or punishment is carried out. While investigating pseudo-organizations is indeed a serious crime, the distribution aspect is still somewhat unsatisfactory to the people's livelihoods. If those with power take advantage of their positions to engage in corruption in the distribution of items such as cloth, matches, and soap, please punish them severely to appease the people, who are greatly blessed.</p>
<p>The method of selling coal at reduced prices recently is excellent. Each household must use their electricity bill as proof. In this way, one can both avoid middlemen from profiting without delivering real benefits and prevent stores from cheating in the process. The authorities can use the lower half of the electricity bill as a reference, and from now on, all sales at reduced prices will be handled this way to put an end to bad practices. Zhou Dingzhong</p>

<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Jones, a columnist for the Christian Proverb News, once chatted with President Roosevelt in Hyde Park. He asked Roosevelt, "Will you expect James Jr. (Roosevelt's eldest son) to be a great man, the same as you?" Roosevelt replied very seriously, "To use yourself as the standard for your children and grandchildren's future is a pride, and also a contempt."</p>
<p>This answer has only one meaning, that is, life is one's own!</p>
<p>In these years, we have seen books about "life" everywhere, such as "The Road of Life," "Life and Cultivation," "Secrets to Getting Along in the World," and "Life Experiences..." They are truly dazzling. Perhaps the writers of these books are all "veterans" who are experienced in the world, and their intentions may be very proper, and their contents may be very real, but the problem is whether these things can resonate with individual lives?</p>
<p>We must admit that life is "self" and "personal." The life experiences, successes, and cultivations of a certain person can never be used as a map. To think that because someone else has blazed a path in life, I can mechanically follow it as I advance along my own is a very big mistake.</p>
<p>Life should be creative, not imitative; life is pioneering, not following; life is even more "today," not canned, not ancient!</p>
<p>Kruglyakov was determined to be Gorky's "disciple." He devoted himself to learning Gorky's tone, studying Gorky's life background, and analyzing Gorky's central thoughts. But Gorky patted him on the shoulder and said, "Child, work hard in your own way! Imitating Gorky is a foolish thing."</p>
<p>Taking one's own life to make a model for others is a despicable pride; taking the lives of others as a copy for one's own is a terrible destruction. One's own future is always endless!</p>
<p>This is not calling on us to be conceited, high-minded people. It is rather saying that life has a "polytypic individuality." Roses and dog-roses are roughly the same, but you cannot make your dog-rose into someone else's rose. When you build your own life and create your own life, you will agree with Shelley's famous poem--"The Ant and the Fly"--and sing:</p>
<p>"I don't compare myself with you--fly--I have my own life!"</p>
<p>We say again that the highest achievement of those who use the lives of others as models is merely the tail end of life.</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Growth of the Chinese Air Force <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>The army of our nation has always surpassed the navy and air force. However, since experiencing this three-dimensional war, the navy and air force began to rise in prominence, especially the air force. It exerted unparalleled power and made indelible contributions to the history of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In 1932, the Chinese Air Force was born in an environment of extreme material shortages. The Central Aviation School was officially established in Hangzhou, which was the embryonic stage of our air force.</p>
<p>On the second day after the outbreak of the "August 13th" Battle of Shanghai (August 14, 1937), the air force, which had not been growing for long, bravely attacked enemy ships, inflicting significant blows on the stubborn enemy. This was truly something that the enemy and the people of Shanghai did not expect. In a short span of five years, the Chinese Air Force's position was solidified. August 14th was then designated as our nation's Air Force Memorial Day. This was the childhood of our nation's air force.</p>
<p>Later, we received assistance and aid from our Allied nations, forming a powerful elite force that exerted its maximum effectiveness in various defense battles, winning the sympathy of various countries. The United States, in particular, sent many air force personnel to help us in difficult circumstances, finally defeating the strong enemy and achieving final victory. This was the developmental period of our nation's air force.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the Air Force Command was distributed in five locations: Chongqing, Guilin, Chengdu, Lanzhou, and Kunming. The largest tactical unit was a group of flying squadrons formed into a group, and each flying squadron included twelve aircraft, which in itself was a basic tactical unit. Therefore, the organization of our nation's air force was generally similar to that of other countries.</p>
<p>Now that the war has ended, we have also heard about the whereabouts of General Chennault. It is said that the Central Aviation School will be moved back to Hangzhou, and it is also heard that Chinese paratroopers have already performed in Kunming. We have great expectations for the future of the air force, and we hope that the Chinese Air Force will contribute to national defense in its adulthood, thus fulfilling the meaning of establishing the air force in our nation.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Rectifying School Discipline <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Xiyuan</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the material losses of the people of our nation are truly incalculable. And the spiritual damage is even more indescribable in words. Not to mention anything else, just in terms of the school discipline in education, it is already extremely heartbreaking. The school discipline here does not specifically refer to the good or bad discipline of students. It includes whether principals, teachers, students, and school workers are fulfilling their duties. There are numerous schools in Shanghai, and among them, there are indeed many that are well-run. However, there are also countless schools that use schools as a tool for profit, so-called "study shops." Principals engage in various forms of misconduct, such as over-enrolling students, exploiting teachers, speculating and hoarding goods, selling diplomas, and surrendering to the enemy. Teachers, under the pressure of life, teach extra classes everywhere, are late to class, or absent, and student papers are not graded or returned. Students, of course, are even worse. They write love letters, read novels, and talk about movies during class. The order in the classroom is worse than a tea house. Teachers who know how to handle things can barely manage to teach, but those who are rigid will simply kick you out. And what about the school workers? They are lazy and rude, and even demand tips from teachers and students. Otherwise, they will not report guests or forward phone calls. Such examples are too numerous to write down. In short, school discipline has plummeted.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all facilities are gradually returning to their original state. However, school discipline remains the same. The principal is still a school shop owner, the teachers still hold multiple jobs, the students still fool around all day, and the school workers are still the same. If this continues, how can schools be run well? Education is supposed to cultivate young people, but now it has become a way to harm them. Can we turn a blind eye to such bad school discipline? Can we not rectify it immediately?</p>
<p>In my opinion, first, I hope that the Ministry of Education will issue a clear order to revitalize school discipline and encourage integrity. Second, the Shanghai Education Bureau should have a war-like method to supervise each school. Third, it is necessary to screen whether the principals and teachers are qualified and whether they have lost their integrity. Fourth, inform each school to raise standards, teach strictly, and not hesitate to hold students back or expel them. Fifth, improve teachers' salaries and limit extra classes. Sixth, investigate students' academic records in detail and hold graduation exams. Seventh, vigorously promote teacher training. Eighth, compile and publish educational publications. The above eight items are the main matters for rectifying school discipline. If they can be implemented in order, then school discipline will definitely turn from decline to prosperity, from evil to good.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Einstein on the Atomic Bomb <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Jun</p>
<p>Since the United Nations defeated the two major aggressor leaders in the East and West, the future of the world has revealed a ray of brilliant light. All peace-loving people are grateful that the United Nations is based on the great spirit of moral mutual assistance and cooperation to seek world peace and human happiness. However, on the other hand, some people are extremely worried about the atomic bomb, which is called the "weapon of peace." Many people say that this atomic bomb achieved world peace, but in the future, world peace may be destroyed by it.</p>
<p>In fact, this is also unnecessary speculation. Is the trauma left by the war not enough to give us a serious lesson? I think that as long as everyone can trust each other and prioritize world peace, there will be no problem with the guarantee of peace. However, until now, the Soviet Union and the United States are still troubled and suspicious about the atomic bomb. According to a recent Washington telegram, the U.S. House of Representatives is about to consider a bill to prohibit foreign disclosure of information obtained from the upcoming atomic bomb bombing fleet test. The reason is to prevent the future security of the United States from being threatened. The Soviet Union requested that the "secret" of the atomic bomb be made public or that it be included in the control, naturally also for fear of being threatened.</p>
<p>In recent months, countless politicians and scientists have provided opinions on the atomic bomb. Recently, the world-renowned scientist, the inventor of the theory of relativity, Professor Albert Einstein, also published his views on the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Einstein does not advocate keeping this secret forever. He said, "Keeping the secret of the atomic bomb is not the happiness of mankind's future. Reporting it to strong countries or managing it jointly by the United Nations are both solutions." Looking at Einstein's words, we can see that he strongly advocates establishing mutual trust between nations: "I believe that peace-loving countries in the world can draft a concrete peace plan that is acceptable to all countries in the world." His vision is indeed very broad. Peace cannot be guaranteed by shouting empty slogans, nor can it be guaranteed by a few people.</p>
<p>Einstein further explained the root cause of eliminating war from a psychological point of view, and his arguments are very pertinent: "If the countries in the world understand that their problems cannot be solved by war, they will compromise. If they think about the tragic consequences of war, then the cause of the war becomes insignificant."</p>
<p>The reason why some people are deeply worried and cannot help but fear that the atomic bomb, which ended this war of aggression, may become the demon of another war, is mainly because mankind has not been able to truly understand the true meaning of peace. At least some of them still believe that war can solve everything and gain everything. This is really wrong. Except for aggression, war is unnecessary, and aggression has a great practical lesson that is currently in front of us: Victory ultimately belongs to the side that adheres to justice. So why think about war again? You say it is to prevent war, but that is not something that can be achieved by this so-called "weapon of peace." If you defend against him and he defends against you, even if there is no war, confrontation and suspicion will arise first. As one member of the U.S. House of Representatives said, "Using war to resolve international disputes and conflicts has become a thing of the past. An eye for an eye will mean that mankind will never have peace." Yes, we should seek reasonable ways to resolve all international disputes and conflicts and never use retaliatory means. Now that the two major aggressors in the East and West have been disintegrated, it is time for all countries to jointly seek permanent peace. Everyone must establish confidence in peace--from self-confidence to mutual trust and common faith. Instead of worrying about the threat of war, why not first eliminate the root causes of war from a psychological point of view and remove the heart of suspicion?</p>
<p>The power of peace has increased and can converge into a main stream that prevents war. Whoever dares to risk the disapproval of the world, whoever dares to play with fire, will be submerged by the waves of peace.</p>
<p>In addition, I think there is one more point that should be recognized: The effectiveness of atomic energy should be universally applied to various aspects that improve human welfare. That is to say, scientists should carefully study how to apply the atomic bomb to all aspects of life related to humans, shift people's incorrect misunderstandings about atomic energy, and eliminate people's one-sided views on atomic energy, thinking that it is the only tool of war. I think that even the term "weapon of peace" should not be allowed to exist. Let's simply call the atomic bomb that was first and last used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki the "God of Peace."</p>
<p>Remember the lessons of war, strengthen the power of peace, and we should cherish Einstein's proposition.</p>

<p>Even though the weather was very bad, a retired sailor still flew at will. His oxygen mask did not seem to make him feel uncomfortable, but when he flew to an altitude of 16,000 feet, he suddenly started to sweat and his face turned green. So he quickly flew back to the airfield and went to the hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, he died 28 hours later.</p>
<p>It turned out that this poor victim did not tell the authorities of the airline that he had previously undergone artificial pneumothorax (commonly known as air injections) treatment at a tuberculosis sanatorium. His death was due to a law in physics: When atmospheric pressure decreases, the cavities in the lungs begin to expand, leading to fatal complications.</p>
<p>Dr. Tang, in the journal of aviation medicine, once said: Patients who have undergone artificial pneumothorax treatment should not fly; if they must fly, then they should not fly higher than 5,000 feet.</p>

<p>A Reader Asks About Mother's Illness:</p>
<p>Editor, please, for God's sake, disclose this letter. My mother fell ill last August. The symptoms are: her abdomen became hard and swollen, with daily, piercing pain like needles, her gums are also sore, food has no taste, bowel movements are difficult and require laxatives for slight relief. Our whole family is already in dire straits, how can we afford doctors and medicine? I hope you, sir, can introduce kind-hearted gentlemen and tell us what simple treatments are available, so my mother can escape her suffering. Your kindness would be like a rebirth. (A Reader)</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: Based on the symptoms described in the letter, it is likely a gastrointestinal illness. A detailed examination is necessary. You can go to the diagnosis and treatment department of Tongde Hospital at 67 Zhengyang Road every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday afternoon from 2 to 4 pm for a free examination and treatment.</p>
<p>Zheng Huiming Asks: My neighbor has a son surnamed Zhao, who has suffered from bedwetting for many years. He is now seventeen years old and has seen many doctors, but none have been effective. Please, sir, use a corner of your newspaper to ask kind-hearted doctors to provide a treatment method. Your kindness would be like a rebirth.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: The Zhao boy has suffered from bedwetting for many years because of a weak constitution. He should take more blood-tonifying and body-strengthening agents and exercise.</p>
<p>Xu Zhongzhi Asks: I have returned from Chongqing specifically to bring my mother to Shanghai for treatment. Because I am unfamiliar with the place, I do not know the names or addresses of famous ophthalmologists. Therefore, I venture to ask you, sir: My mother lost her sight during the war, and her suffering is unbearable. In 1937, one day my mother was walking in the street when suddenly her left eye experienced extreme pain and became blurry. This continued for nine days and nights until she received treatment at Nanchang Hospital. The specialist ophthalmologist was German and was said to be quite famous. After the examination, he said the disease was called "cataracts," and there was too much fluid inside the pupil, requiring surgery to drain the fluid, otherwise the right eye would also be affected and lose its sight. After the surgery, it was not effective, and the left eye could no longer see the light of day, but it no longer felt pain. After three or four years, the right eye developed the same problem, with intermittent pain. Because there were no surgical facilities in the small place, only medicine was available. The medicine was very effective, called "Pilo Oorping," which dilates the pupils, can relieve pain, and makes vision clearer. But after using up this medicine, it was no longer available, so the vision in the eyes became more blurry. The only characteristic is that both eyes look the same as normal people, but they cannot see at all. Please introduce a famous ophthalmologist to seek treatment and restore her sight.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: Based on the situation described in your letter, it is likely "cataracts." In theory, surgical treatment should have been applied at that time, which may have been promising. Now that so much time has passed and the optic nerve has atrophied, it may be difficult to restore sight. If you are willing, sir, you can ask an ophthalmologist to study it again.</p>
