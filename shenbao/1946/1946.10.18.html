<h3>平漢綫北段國軍反擊　攻防戰再度展開　安陽北上國軍抵臨洛關</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕平漢北段國軍，十七日午起南下開始反攻，迄下午五時，前鋒已迫最近失守之松林店，該車站共軍聞訊，預先撤出，埋伏兩個，該車站十七晚可收復，國軍此次反攻，採穩紮穩打，收復者絕不傳其再失。共軍仍本其避實攻虛辦法，十七日上午又集相當兵力，由兩側推近逐縣，永樂兩車站，企圖收牽制之效。高碑店東方昨夜起亦已集結有二萬餘人，有沿通高碑店，松林店大道增援勢，平漢北段攻防戰再度展開，傳琉璃河西之周口店已被共軍攻陷，該支綫完全被毀。石家莊南之元氏縣及車站被北軍攻擊，昨經證明不確。據交通繼關統計，自九月廿九日迄今，平漢北段被共軍破壞之戲路共達百公里，鐵橋近六十孔，路軌運往山中，枕木燒毀，路基掘成寬二公尺深一公尺之曲綫溝，估計全段搶修至能夠通車，需時一個月。</p>

<h3>招待平市中外記者　陳總長報告軍事　記者團昨晚抵懷來視察</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕陳誠總長十七日在摺待記者席上宣稱：張垣收復後，政府樹望衝政治途徑解決國共糾紛，設如不幸而必用軍事解決，則彼相信少則三月，多則五月，即可解決，不一定如周來所云必須打二十年。陳總長對軍事局勢至爲樂觀，認爲共軍無力反攻張家口。大同亦無再度被圖之虞，目前平綏綫張垣，懷來關業已會師，張垣，大同間五百至七日內亦必可打通。擾亂平漢北段者係土八路，短期必可澄清。該及依復交通稱：政府如用軍事力量打通津浦，平漢兩路，估計兩週即可成攻。陳氏在答記者問中，暗示國軍次一目標不致連指延安，由於回答國軍是否將攻延安問題時，重述前在南京談話，大同，張家口，承德爲一個戰塲，但並未將延安包括在內。記者詢以政府是否將通軍姻台，以恢復海上交通，陳答謬清路打通，烟台就不成問題了。陳氏曾檢討張家口戰設稱：十二戰區部隊，出共軍不意而坻張垣，遂奏首功，張垣收復之重要，不僅在其戰略地位，亦在其經濟價値，今後平綏修復，後奪糧食可源源東下，沿海之紗布，棉花亦可西運，關係軍民生活至鉅。陳氏估計，自六月以來關內共軍損失，起碼在二十萬以上，其中尤以李先念部損失最大，共產黨雖可用「動員」補充其人員之傷亡，但武器彈藥之損失與戰志之瓦解，則爲無法補充者。某記者詢以國內軍事衝突是否可能引起國際糾紛，陳答共產黨曾稱國軍圍攻張家口將索動國際局勢，但事實上並未有此類事件發生，目前舉世各國皆希望中國和平統一。陳總長記者招待會，係於十七日下午五時在平外交大樓舉行，到中外記者五十餘人，歷一時半始散。</p>

<h3>山東全境無戰事　攻府掌握區域日益增大　蘇北國軍三面包圍興化</h3>

<h3>中英間貿易　應早日恢復</h3>
<p>英化工協會主席演說</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕中英商會頃在此間舉行聚餐會，英帝國化學工業協會主席麥克高溫　　發表演說稱，吾人迫切　望中英兩國能早日恢復貿易，互相交換貨物。中英兩國若不以貨物互相交換，則中國勢將無法發展，并改善其人民之生活情形。中國長期英勇抗戰，已博得全世界之無限敬仰。但戰爭之影響較諸戰爭本身更爲長久，殆可斷言。以言聯合國善救總署，英國曾慷慨　將，貢獻良多，在　　英國曾以大量資本，投於中國。即以敝公司而論，亦曾協助中國，發展其染料及其他化學工業。但在中國得英國之協助實行工業化以前，吾人頗願　見中國政局趨於穩定，故英帝國工業協會，在中國政局未能趨於穩定之前，雅不欲在中國各工廠投資。目前中國國內局勢，尙未能穩定，殊屬不幸，同時中國政府所頒佈之財政法令，亦未能滿足國外投資之合理需要。英國實業家對於中國某種稅則之欠公　，以及若干不法商人之大規模逃稅，深表關切云。在此中國駐英大使　天錫起立答覆稱，余深信中英兩國保持友誼，對於世界局勢之安定，必有　大裨益，時以促進兩國邦交爲念云。</p>

<h3>時乎時乎不再來！　—願中共慎勿失此最後的良機</h3>
<p>在時局又臨到一個重要轉捩點的時候，我們讀了　蔣主席前天所發表關於處理目前時局的文吿，特別感到欣慰。這一文吿的發表，重申了政府對於國內政治問題，始終堅持以政治方式解決的基本態，同時重視全國人民渴望和平之迫切，採納了其它方面的許多意見，充分表示政府所持停戰的一貫願望。這聲明的發表，在處理目前的時局上，實且有深長的意義。</p>
<p>不僅如此，我們如果探索　蔣主席所以發表這一文吿的原委，自必更增加我們對於政府具有和平誠意的認識，而這種認識，將因昨天下午吳鐵城邵力子雷震三氏代表政府來滬之一行，更能使我們對和談前途抱着樂觀。回溯這四五天的進展局勢，孫科院長十三日携有第三方面人士的建議自滬返京，十四日即面陳　蔣主席；當晚政協秘書長雷震則京來滬，十五日整天在滬訪晤各黨各派及社會賢達之政協代表，交換意見，希望共促中共代表進京商談，使和平得以實現。十六日上午雷震氏由滬回抵首都，即列席國防最高委員會，報吿蒞滬商洽經過，謂各方均願盡力幹旋，使中共仍與政府進行和談，惟盼政府先有一種可以停戰的表示，俾得取信於中共，如能更派政協之政府代表一二人赴滬相邀，當更可期其趨於融洽。這就是　蔣主席前天發表極大讓步的文吿，和吳邵二氏昨天偕雷秘書長同來上海磋商的原因。我們明白了這段經過，必更深信政府確實渴望和平，其至誠的態度，也該可以金石爲開了吧。</p>
<p>由於政府所抱的態度如此寬宏，政府尋求和平的途徑如此迫切，更由於經過八年抗戰的人民蘄求休養生息如大旱之望雲霓，我們料想任何黨派，到此時總應該釋嫌修好，化干戈爲玉帛了。上海市參議會昨天向中共和各黨派代表的呼籲，敦促他們進京商談爲，實在是代表了人民而說的話。我們別無他語，也祇有呼籲中共代表尅日入都，開誠商談。今天應該不是空口喊停戰的時候，而已經是水到渠成，應該大家切實商定永久停戰全面停戰的具體辦法的時候了。今天我們所關心的，不是停戰命令何日頒發，而是任何政黨何日表示放棄武力的誠意。</p>
<p>如今各方面旣以爲只要政府在停戰這件事上有所表示，便可以招致良好的反應，導成和談的重開，而使僵持問題得以全面解決，則　蔣主席文吿中，固已聲明了政府準備即下停止軍事衝突的命令，只要有具體的辦法，這就表示出了政府願與各方合作的一番至誠。爲達到停止衝突可以獲有保證的境界，軍事三人小組必須尅期解決共軍駐地及統編共軍爲國軍的問題。等到共軍駐地解決，統編完成，這纔能真正做到停止衝突。同時，爲解決國內政治紛爭計，非正式五人會議，必須與軍事三人小組會議同時召開，而五人小組之協議又必須交由政協綜合小組獲致其協議，以便進行改組國府，庶幾有關政治軍事的全部問題，均能得到解決。至於關於憲法草案的諸問題，自應即行召開憲草審議委員會，迅予審議，以便送由政府提交國民大會作討論之基礎。同時國民大會旣召集有期，共黨亦應及早提出其代表之名單。所以　主席在其聲明內所列的八點，實在是爲達成停止衝突全面永久化及斟酌解決國內政治紛爭具體的辦法。共產黨果真爲國家爲人民，爭取和平統一，此時就應效法印度的回教聰明與國大黨釋嫌修好的精神，幡然變計，令其代表即日進京商談，以促和平之實現。</p>
<p>政府方面已經大開和平之門，和平之手，中共雖所信主義不同，而同隸中國則一，此時此地也應知所自處了。時乎時乎不再來！願中共慎勿失此最後的良機！</p>

<p>償還長期儲蓄我見</p>
<p>閱各地報載，關於戰前銀行長期存款，經涉訟而爲法院判決，以一千賠償還存戶一事，不禁有所感觸。查我國自抗戰軍興，物價暴漲，月必數次，以致物價較之戰前有數千倍而至於萬倍以上不等。因此薪水階級之公務員，困苦艱難，不可終日。政府有鑒於此，明令加薪，以臻合理。勝利以還，物價指數，日見高漲，乃有三個月調整一次，業已見諸事實之公開明令。以及黃金外匯，受政府之控制，尙且繼續增高，正如居院長對首都記者　詢意見答稱：「若依物價指數言，一千倍并不爲過，米布等值，較戰前有上漲五千倍，或一萬倍以上者。繼謂茲事體大，問題甚多，若不解決，則戰前債務之淸償，長期儲蓄，到期提存時，此等問題，必多糾紛，前曾與財政部俞部長談及此事，現正商議解決辦法中。」</p>
<p>居院長爲法界泰斗，所發言論，殊爲公平而確當，吾以爲法院判決千倍償還戰前存款，於存戶受虧甚大。存戶如非信守儲蓄規定，提取存款，改存其他物資。縱然不說萬倍以上，四五千倍以上，毫無問題，假使銀行以千倍償還戰前儲蓄，姑以五千倍起碼而言，豈非存戶要受四以上之損失乎？銀行爲金融之樞紐，銀行界人員，爲經濟專門人才，對於存戶因存款而受之影響，不能諉爲不知。既已知之，則人之天良，不能泯滅！誠如紫竹君所言：「二千元，戰前可購屋一所者，今不足糴米四升，」吾知當道諸公，決不爲此，亦決不忍出此耳！長期儲蓄之存戶，其數目決不甚大，殷實之家，不會長期存款，長期存款者，定屬安分守法之良民，決無投機妄想發財之人，參　其間，或以子女教育婚配，以及本已年邁養老之　，一時不易籌措，故預爲之計，不惜以十年二十年悠久之歲月，而爲積寸盈尺之呆計。若然，戰前長期儲蓄，至少應以五千倍償還存戶，始得爲平，縱然銀行方面，因此而不免受到鉅大之損失，應由政府公開提取敵偽財產，以作償還銀行之用。蓋幣價之貶值，由於敵人之侵略，假使敵人不發動侵略，則我國幣制穩定，毫無戰前戰後之區別，以敵偽財產，而作賠償存戶之損失，揆之法理，當無不　，要不過假銀行之手，以爲辦理過戶而已。再以教育費而言，國家對於貧苦學生，公費供給，一個學生之培植，不知花費若干國幣，今有人焉，以自力更生之志願，自行長期儲蓄，以作子女教育費用之打算，吾知政府當褒獎之不暇，何忍令儲戶失所依恃耶？決不能聽由銀行，以片面理由：（假定商業銀行，以百分之二十存於國庫，不得動用）而作泯滅天良之舉，我國同情，不平則鳴，吾將代表一切弱小存戶，大聲疾呼，同情法院以千倍償還戰前長期儲蓄之原則，而償還數量，至少應達到五千倍或七千倍。并贊同司法院長與財政部長，商議解決辦法，明令公布。早日實現，以平民憤，不勝企予望之矣。（周子魯）</p>

<h3>毒藥來源推測</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡十七日電〕戈林在獄中服毒自殺後，當局可能傳訊多人，以偵查如何獲得此一管毒藥。戈林之妻可能亦被傳詢，渠曾於十月七日在獄中與其夫訣別，渠步出監獄時面部嚴肅，但眼眶內並無淚痕。其他將被傳詢者有戈林之辯護人史達瑪博士曾在美國醫師一名監視下，爲戈林診察之德醫弗魯徹，以及監獄德籍職員廿七人。此等德人在入獄服務前，曾受嚴密搜查，入獄後即從未出外。戈林所服毒藥當係最近所得，蓋着藏之已久，藥性發作不能如此之速。各方面之猜測，有謂毒藥管或係戈林夫人與其夫訣別接吻時所授一說，或係德籍理髪師爲戈林理髮時將藥管私塞其領口內，然據監獄當局宣佈，迄至目前爲止，尚未有因此此案被捕者。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡十六日電〕紐倫堡法院安全部官員泰琪少校稱：就余可知，戈林所服毒藥，係由其妻所授一點，乃屬不可能者。戈林之妻最後一次晤其夫，係在十日以前，當時兩人隔一厚玻璃片而立，戈林復加手銬，兩人亦未按吻，余覺戈林於被捕時，即密藏此管毒藥云。</p>
<h3>早萌自殺之念</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡十七日電〕據紐倫堡法院某官員稱：戈林於服毒前之九日，會作似與自殺有關之　辭，當囑其簽字於某種文件時，戈林取下文件之紙夾，並謂「此物最好收回，恐看守將以爲余擬用此物上吊矣」。再就其他事賞觀之，可證戈林自殺之念，於聞判絞決時即已決定，且可能曾與李賓特洛甫在出庭時，討論服毒自殺之事。自宣判後，戈林與獄吏之談話以及其行爲，均不知不覺顯示心中蓄有某種觀念。監獄心理病專家吉爾勃博士謂，戈林聞判後最感不快爲絞繩，後乃托其辯擭人申請改處槍決，隨後又發生紙夾之戲謔。戈林復在獄中與紐倫堡法庭主任精神病專家凱萊博士談話時，又透露對絞刑之恐怖，同時當局已命美第三軍某軍官，以與該案無關之身份，主持進行調查戈林毒案，其報告書預料可於兩日內向四國委員國提出。</p>

<h3>美國南方多教士（上）　一片辭行送別聲紛紛候輪返中國</h3>
<p>— （本報特派員毛樹清）</p>
<p>〔紐約九月十五日航訊〕南方，那錦繡田園的美國南方，不僅是棉花菸草的產地，同時也是傳教士們的故鄉。在紐約和芝加哥街上行走，偶而有三五成羣的退伍士兵迎面向你來一句：「頂好」，或「好天氣」之類的中國話，這些人算是「喝過海水」的美國人，他們有一種英雄式的驕傲流露在北方社會；但在南方會講，會聰，會寫中國字的美國人，不算一回事，這批人便是傳教士。我去田納西州參觀TVA的時候，火車中忽然牙齒發痛，一到諾克斯微爾城，第一件事便是拜訪一位六十多歲的老牙醫。在候診室裏，我坐著看報，一位慈祥的老太太神過頭來輕輕地問我：「您先生貴姓」？</p>
<p>我吃了一驚的和她拉手，她說：她的各字呌「涂太太」，她丈夫現在中國，中國抗戰以前，她們倆夫婦都是湖南常德基督救內地會的傳教士，她是戰爭期中回到美國來的，現在正候船返中國。她說：她愛常德，甚於愛田納西的老家，「不過中國缺乏科學和工業。所以臨行之前，需要檢查一下身體，牙齒壞了，該拔的就拔，免得到中國以後再患病。」我問她：涂先生的英文名字該怎麼拼？她非常乾脆的用中文講：「就呌我涂太太好了，我歡喜中國字。」她用鉛筆在候診室裏表現起來，許多有「鄉曲」氣味的南方人伸著　子望她。在諾克斯微爾，比徐太太「資格」更老的傳教士是海侔登夫婦，我在諾城唯一的一家中國洗衣店中碰到他，他看見我的洗衣單子，伸出手來說：　　你是毛先生？久仰，久仰。他在地方報紙上看見我的名字，他用中文寫出「海侔登」三個字，實際上，他的英文原名叶漢密爾頓，跟三民主義上國父所講美國開國時的政治家漢密爾頓完全同名。他在江蘇徐州傳教的時候，有一位中國朋友替他定名爲海侔登，他說：「從此我就姓海，我的兒子也姓海。」那天晚上，海侔登先生帶著他一位非常美麗的小姐，來接我去赴一個親戚家中的談話會，在路上我問他：什麽時候返中國？他說馬上就要動身，「但徐州附近赤匪非常猖獗。」她女兒緊接著問：「什麽呌赤匪？」海侔登孜孜不倦的告訴她：「匪就是強盜，赤在中國文字中，便是紅色的意思，因此在中文中不呌共產黨，呌做赤匪。」他又補充說；「因爲共產黨沒有宗教，沒有精神生活，沒有道德觀念，所以一概稱之爲匪。」這位洋牧師的教育精神感動了他的女兒，她頻頻點頭。在那天的</p>
<p>家庭座談會上，海侔登替我介紹了許多老太太，和幾位業已退休了的牧師，海侔登的太太和兒子也在座，她的中文比丈夫說得更好，她要我寫一個「貓」字和「馬」字，給許多虔誠於宗教的老太太們欣賞，至少，在這羣老太太們的眼光中，海侔登夫歸是他們心目中的「英雄」。海侔登用英文講了一大番辭行的話，感謝他們及她們的餞別，他說：「我這一次到中國去，雖然江蘇徐州是在共黨的包圍之中，雖然我的生命軀殼都有犧牲的危險，雖然中國的經濟非常艱困；但是我爲了主，爲了耶穌基督，我一定要勇敢的前去。」他還說：「一個真正虔誠的主的門徒，要有不避生死的信心，這一次去徐州，也許我不會回來，也許再也不會看見各位了，但我心底非常坦然，一切爲了主！」四週的人都非常靜默，常常掛著笑容的瑪麗姑娘，（海侔登的女兒）也凝視了臉。</p>

<h3>吳貽芳論新女性</h3>
<p>『一個模範女子應該是家庭的中心，良好的公民，事業的成功者。』</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕女敎育家金陵女子大學校長吳貽芳博士，昨晨特地由南京趕到上海，爲的是應本市美國婦女協會的邀請演講。</p>
<p>吳博士昨天穿着紫酱色長袖旗袍，黑皮鞋，髮後梳辮髻，精神飽滿，誰都不相信她已是上了五十的人。</p>
<p>吳博士於昨午四時，在圓明園路一三三號，向數十個美國婦女，提出了下面這個問題，她說：平日大家愛說，「讀書於女人是一種浪費，等到一結婚，便什麼都完了。」這種錯誤的觀念，如何來糾正呢？—唯有用婦女自己的力量來爭取合法地位。</p>
<p>女子在新中國的地位如何呢？吳博士把它分成三方面來說：（一）家庭中的地位——歷史的例子告訴人們，婦女和家庭似乎是永遠分不開的，所以一般人說：「到頭來總是結婚，讀什麼書呢？」其實，即使是在家庭中，女子的地位還是非常重要。中國人有一句老話：「三歲看到大，九歲看到老。」可見孩童時期的敎育如何重要。一個受過高等敎育的女子，一定是家庭的中心，使她的孩子有一個優良的環境，單是把童裝美化是不够的，要把自己的孩子培植成一個健全的公民，健康，堅靱，有民族思想和國家觀念。（二）社會中之地位——新的女性，除了是家庭的中心外，更應該放大眼光，成爲社會中之一員。中國已將實施憲政，對於國大代表的選舉，也應該發生濃厚的興趣，熱烈的參加進去。（三）職業方面——如何選擇婦女的職業呢？吳博士說：「不要排出風頭的，容易的，或是賺錢的。事業成功的秘訣，在於興趣。要排適合自己興趣的職業，這樣鴻才會全神一貫的去做。一般地說來，如社會服務，敎育，醫務，和律師等，都是更適和婦女的，因爲女人辦事細心，謹慎和當有同情心。而過去的事實告訴我們，男女的智力是完全平等的。只要我們肯努力，就不怕不會成功。」</p>
<p>最後，吳博士激動地說：「這是時機了，婦女們應該努力。在重建中國的過程中，婦女的力量是不能缺少的。我們要充實自己，準備發揮我們的力量！——結婚對於婦女不應該再是事業的結束，而是開始。我們要繼續不斷地前進。一個模範的女子，應該是家庭的中心，良好的公民，同時也是事業的成功者！」</p>
<p>吳博士的演講，在堂聲中結束。到會的中外來賓，都爭先與她握手問好。記者在百忙中頻頻以金陵女大近况相問，知道金大已經安穩地上課了。因爲校中的設備受到戰火的浩劫，復校後仍是簡陋不堪。所以處處感到不方便。但是師生的精神可嘉，他們洗冷水臉，睡硬地板，然而誰都沒有怨言！吳博士昨晨到上海後，第一件事情便是親往中國旅行社，詢問向美國訂購的科學儀器，來了沒有。吳博士非常高興的吿訴記者說，「儀器都已經到了，已到了兩個月，馬上可以運到南京，學生們都可以應用了。」對於吳博士那種認眞辦學的熱忱，引起我無限的敬意！金大的同學是幸福的。因爲她們有這樣一位出色的校長！</p>
<h3>兩路舞弊案　經六小時審訊辯論後　定二十四日上午宣判　各犯相互對質醜態百出商人一體供認確曾借錢　郁香巖要求更改供詞筆錄發生爭吵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局材料處大舞弊案，自上月二十日初審後，原定本月一日再審，後因承審推事梅爾和臥病，故延至昨日始開辯論庭。被押扣之路局職員暨被牽連之各商號經理協理全部案犯三十六名，及前材料處副處長丁澍惠，張伯康之妻陸潤寳等均全體出庭，被吿辯護律師二十二人，各報記者到三十餘人，致旁聽席上有人滿之患。審訊自上午九時二十五分開始，直至下午三時五十分始完畢。經各犯對質，答辯各被吿律師順次辯論一後，審判長即宣佈本案辯論終結一定本月廿四日上午宣判。不料梅推事一語甫畢，左側被吿律師席上勝昌五金號經理於仲路之辯護律師俞宗駱，突然起立，大呼「本案之最後辯論權係屬於檢察官」全庭爲之震驚。按依刑事訴訟法第二百八十三條規定，刑事案件之最後辯論權應屬於被吿。當庭雖經梅推事解釋，檢察官之發言係補充，不作辯論，然二十餘辯護律師仍相互紛紛議論，適此時郁香巖亦因要求更正供詞紀錄，與　記官發生爭吵，同時另一被吿家屬，亦趁幾要求保釋大夫，哭閙不已，法庭秩序幾無法維持。六小時之「疲勞審問」遂於此混亂中終塲。</p>
<h3>被告欄中　烏壓壓一片人頭</h3>
<p>昨日因　　論庭，故各律師到庭特平，九時二十五分法警高呼開庭，梅爾和推事，全匋檢察官借書記官魚貫而出。繼之被吿張鴻圖，郁香嚴，經偉鈞，王人懋，陳景曜，朱必聞，張開源，張澤隆，朱培宗，顧振民，兪培恩，夏定武，孫學三，徐傳貴，蔡志道，何祖恩，李潔，及商人於仲路，施　祥，李汾賓，金雲亭，李賓汾，王雲仙，吳蓮慶，石耀庭，楊文禮，沈連生，周錦華，徐炳洪，兪毅夫，李行信，沈會鄉，忻鼎甫等三十六人，隨法警到庭後，分三批排立於被吿欄，梅推事逐一點名後，首先傳訊初審時未到庭之五金商施慶祥，並傳路局職員經手收受佣金之經偉鈞對質。經偉鈞對收錢送禮忽又否認，而各商號經理則供認確會借錢等事，雙方供詞相互矛盾。</p>
<h3>張伯康與張鴻圖　當庭對質</h3>
<p>繼傳張伯康興張鴻圖對質，張伯康則供稱：「在去年十二月二十日以前，某天上午，至張處長家，送贓款一百萬元，內四十萬爲現鈔，六十萬元爲支票，張鴻圖不要支票，　掉現鈔」云云。張鴻圖則謂「去年十二月路局接收伊始，工作較爲忙碌，故不論假日或星期，每日上午必到局辦公，張伯康所稱上午來我家相見，即已不確，其爲揑造已顯見。」並提出反證四項：（一）張伯康係本人介紹入路局，如有串通舞弊，正可利用，何一再請求撤換。（二）郁香嚴非路局職員，不能顧問材料處事務，至於分配佣金更無所知。（三）採購材料時從未授意收佣金，事實可調查。（四）據各人供詞，訂定分　佣　辦法時，本人在杭州未返，更無從參預。</p>
<h3>兩位太太　針鋒相對</h3>
<p>傳張伯康之妻陸澗　與郁香嚴對質，張陸澗實否認彼夫之　護律師王效文係陳伯莊所代聘，及陳伯莊願負担張伯康子女今後敎育費。郁香嚴則一口咬定。另一證人副處長丁厚夫則稱雖身爲副處長，然一切由處長專權，彼一無所知。</p>
<p>上午十一時許開始辯論，全檢察官對郁香嚴部份解釋稱郁案發後逃避抗傳，不能作自行投案，並由各犯供收佣金等犯罪行爲皆係郁指使云云。郁之辯護律師祝匡明辯稱：檢察官對郁香嚴之貪汚罪行一無具體證據，不足成立。各該犯之口供，亦不能證實被吿有確實之犯罪行爲云云。張伯康之辯護律師俞承修亦辯稱：被吿實爲一「老實人」，蓋路局給地檢處之公函中，即說明張伯康個性忠厚，此案之能揭發，並能明白眞相，張伯康實有助力云云，繼之由出庭各律師相繼辯論完畢。</p>
<h3>六小時審訊後　宣告辯論終結</h3>
<p>全岡檢察官起立補充，分事實與法律二方面，事實方面諸商皆已承認經偉鈞借錢等事，有一商號達七百餘萬之多，足見如此大數目，已非普通禮物。並稱起訴中對各被吿在路局時口供引用甚少，而引用自白書較多，蓋自白書較可靠也，至於法律方面引用懲治合污條例，甚合於立法精神，商人應負法律責任，不能以從前之習慣衡量也。至此庭上即宣吿　　終結，曾引起被吿律師之不滿。斯時法官與律師經六小時餘之不停　論訊問後，皆已疲勞不堪，各被吿亦已不勝站立之苦，審訊就此終結。</p>
<h3>新代步工具　三輪汽車　將出現於滬上　沿途可以僱坐</h3>
<p>據悉，本市若干人力車公司及三輪車製造公司等，鑒於即有遭受當局取締之可能，乃改變方針，向國外訂購大批三輪汽車來滬，組織三輪汽車出租公司營業。據聞是項三輪汽車原價每輛約美金四百元，另加關稅，運費，共四百三十元之譜，合法幣一百五十餘萬元。是項車輛每介侖汽油可行七十五哩，能載普通乘客三人。並悉是項即將成立之三輪汽車公司，資本額約自三億元至五億元，將來正式成立後，營業辦法與出租三輪車相髣髴，按日應得車租，視車上新裝之「路碼表」指示數字而定，並不若出差汽車公司之設立分站。亦如營業三輪車之停留於交通要衝當局指定之停車處。至於每次載客價目，亦照「路碼表」上所示行駛路途遠近而定。</p>
<h3>逆倫案轟動北新涇　踢死老父隣人高發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西北新涇馬家宅鄕民馬阿桃，五十六歲。育有一子，名順玉卅二歲，忤逆不孝，對老父教誨，不特不聽，反動　毆打，致父子情感破裂。前晨又因細故爭吵，順玉對老父飽以老拳，復又用足猛踢。馬雙無力抵抗，被其一腳踢於腹部，痛極　地，旋即殞命。出事之後，馬順玉竟　草草備棺收斂，企圖將此滔天大禍，消減於無形，正成斂時，爲左右鄰居激於義債，密報新涇分局，當經該局派員到塲阻止收斂，一而將逆子扣留，帶局偵訊。同時將屍體車送常德路驗屍所檢驗，發現屍體傷痕累累。此一逆倫慘劇，業已轟動該鎮，聞兇犯被捕一　而服，已於昨午後移解地檢處法辦。</p>

<h3>參一會地政衛生兩委員　昨午分別舉行二次會議</h3>
<p>市參議會地政委員會，昨日下午四時半假參議會召開第二次會議，出席路式導等七人，地政局長祝平，工務局長趙祖康，財政局副局長胡文元，興業信託社何質夫等均列席，路式導主席，即精祝局長報吿土地興革近况、繼討論所交提案一件，爲准地政局函送修正大木橋路民新村出售辦法，提請核議案，決議修正通過。此外並通過臨時動議一件，爲擬請市府對於房屋租賃所定租金，一律以法幣計算。</p>

<h3>發電量短缺臻嚴重階段　各工廠輪流停電</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市法商水電公司經理勒德洛阿德昨日宣稱：現因該公司發電量之短缺，已　嚴重階段，而冬令轉瞬即至，用電量勢必增加，故凡工廠用戶，在每日下午五時至十時間，必須停止用電。該公司並通函各住家用戶，務將用電量儘量節省。勒氏稱：在前法租界區域內，近日耗電量已較前激增百分之八十以上。</p>
<p>吳市長爲節電事，於前日曾柬邀市參議會各委員會召集人晚餐，對此有所商討，結采僉以爲居民目前用電，僅佔全市消費量之極少部份，用電量已縮至最低，不應再加削減，故當時未作決定，將待下週公用局開會再加討論。</p>
<p>薄暮時分負担最重</p>
<p>上海電力公司總經理法萊士氏，對用戶此種節電方法，是否有補於全市用電情形，亦頗懷疑疑。如各住宅用戶耗電量均減少百分之二十，則前法租界及閘北，因用戶多係住宅，情形當可改善，而於上海電力公司，則毫無裨益。目前發電量之不足，並非由於燃料缺乏，而由於每日某一時間，電力公司之發電能力不勝負担。上海電力公司現在最感困難之時間爲下午五時至六時，爲不致超過公司最大負荷起見，在此一小時中，工廠之不得不停電者頗多。</p>
<p>住宅用戶減少用電百分之二十，在公司全部耗電量中僅能節省百分之二·五。且如僅欲用戶減少用電，則用戶所減用之時或爲深夜，而非最需要節省之薄暮也。</p>
<p>各區工廠停電時間</p>
<p>關於工廠用電，現仍採用輪流停電，每日停電，及緊急停電三辦法，上海電力公司區內紗廠分六組，每日停電，其中二組爲自下午五時至八時，二組五時至九時，二組五時至十時，同時每組輪流於六日內全日停電一决，時間爲上午七時至下午五時。小工廠前日起已分六組進行輪流停電，閘北區內工廠採取輪流停電及緊急停電二種，華商浦東二公司區內則每日下午五時半至九時牛，工廠一律停電。</p>
<h3>滬北二區救火會　新舊會董聯歡會</h3>

<h3>解決房屋租賃糾紛研究設立「市法庭」防止不肖之徒操縱取利強佔房屋者將無可遁形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨對記者稱：市府爲澈底肅清租賃房屋時索取頂費及高抬房租等情事，現正研究設立「市法庭」，專辦房屋租賃糾紛事宜，並聘前美國駐華法庭庭長悔而密克氏爲法律顧問，按海氏現任美孚公司法律顧問，戰前留華頗久，對上海情形及我國法律頗爲熟悉。</p>
<p>該法庭將制定各項明確規定，以防止不肖之徒，操縱居奇，藉租賃取利。而該法庭成立之後，一切租屋糾紛，當可得一有效解決。根據市府規定，凡戰前舊租戶，其房屋曾爲敵佔，而戰後仍由本人居用者，則其原有租約，仍屬有效。</p>
<p>吳市長稱本市房屋問題，確甚棘手，解決亦仍需相當時日。月前問題最大之癥結，在於敵僑撤退後所遺留之房屋，在房配會成立之前，頗多遭人非法強佔。而市法庭成立後之裁定，於一個月內即可執行勒遷。</p>

<h3>日高富明昨出庭作證暴露德日對盟國陰謀</h3>
<p>兩國合作直至日投降爲止</p>
<p>納粹戰犯二十七人，昨日繼續在美軍法庭受審，由前任日本駐華北情報部長日高富明大佐出庭作證，暴露當年德日對盟國之陰謀。日人在德國投降後，軍事節節失利，同時更有兩重隱憂，一爲恐懼美軍自西戰場調來太平洋及非律濱等職區，予日軍以更大之威脅，另一爲惴惴然於蘇聯之對日宣戰，影響日軍在華北方面之作戰。日高富明担任華北情報工作，通常與歐哈德間諜網各工作人員保持密切連絡。華北情報方面，由德人克薩及潘拉爲主腦。在德國投降後，日人憂慮頗深，某夕日高富明曾與克薩會談，克薩以爲據波茨坦會議觀之，蘇聯在最近期間，可能保持其一貫之政策，並無參加盟國對日本作戰之可能，且在西戰場之蘇軍，現正大量復員，故遠東戰局可望無大變化。克薩又告日高富明稱：據彼等所獲得之情報，美軍向太平洋之軍運，可能在兩個月內結束，屆時將對太平洋日軍有莫大威脅。日軍當時對此中情報，極爲重視，甚至合眾社聯合社及各通訊社消息，亦詳加研究，以爲在其中可能探出幕後之政治新聞，德日之合作，未有一日間斷，直至日本投降，此批以領事館爲庇身地之第五縱隊方結束其打擊盟國之好夢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市急轉直下，客銷在內地行情報疲聲中，殊之進胃，廿支紗除特雙馬外，其餘大牌小型，俱降三四萬，十六支尤滯，因毛巾廠成本不合算，更乏人問津，細紗亦跌十三五萬，趨勢仍極軟弱也。</p>
<p>布市昨仍軟弱無力，良以客銷全無，且漢口天津布價，亦有倒褂趨勢，而各帮已採購之貨，迄尚未裝出者尚多，故銷路呆滯，紡建開價雖押抵二千元，申請者仍寥寥，銀很未見轉鬆，實銷又呆，是爲軟弱之二大原因。</p>
<h3>汽油加價真相　油價未動費用酌增出租車無遞加理由</h3>
<p>昨日各報載本市各汽油站於十六日晨宣布加價，每介侖較十五日漲一百五十元，計爲一千三百元，因此出租汽車同業公會亦擬日內召開會議繼之調整價格一節，茲據本報查悉汽油價格，原分兩種，一爲浦東油池交貨價格，每介侖一千〇六十元，現并未變動，一爲市內加油站交貨價格，舊價爲一千一百五十元，其差額九十元，即係自浦東油池灌出至駁輪，運往浦西，灌入油車，再運至各加油站地點，灌入小油池之出駁灌裝等運輸及站上人工一切費用，均須由此支出，此項九十元之差額，係還在本年三月起所規定，距今已有七個月，各油公司屢欲增加，均未成事實，近以收支不敷甚鉅，乃尤其增加一百五十元，爲二百四十元，故浦東油池交貨價格，則不予變動，仍爲一千零六十元，再加差額二百四十元，即爲油站新價格一千三百元，如請本市出租汽車，因汽油每介侖增加售價一百五十元，即須每小時增加三千元，換言之，每車每小時須用二十介侖之多，決無此理，故出租汽車如有要求加價如此之多，決非由於汽油加價之原因。</p>
<h3>三十四年度所利得稅額市商會商定原則未填報者將遭嚴厲處置</h3>
<p>三十四年所利得稅簡化稽征：三個月前稅務署王撫洲來滬，曾在國際飯店招待商會及律師公會會計師公會諸領袖，宣佈本市第一類營利事業所利得稅稽征預算額，爲六百億元，工商業聞之大爲震動，當由各同業分會將各會員資本額營業額及純益額填表報告商會，請商會根據實際情形向政府力爭核減，商會並特設稅務專門委員會主持其事，與稅務當局往返折衝，已歷多時，昨日下午四時，召集棉紡染織棉布綢緞百貨搪瓷捲菸橡膠紙業等十數重要同業公會負責人，商討報繳具體辦法，商會方面出席者，爲杜月笙徐寄廎駱清華潘士浩諸氏，經過長時間之商討，聞已決定原則，惟因各業報繳額，離政府預算相差過鉅，將照大後方簡化稽征成例，普遍增加若干，其迄今尚未填報者，秘務當局將有嚴厲之處置，本星期六下午四時，將再召集大批同業公會宣佈普增辦法，俾得共同遵行云。</p>
<h3>克寧奶粉跌價定貨到埠囤貨出籠</h3>

<h3>中信局昨正式開售人造絲黑市崩潰廠商申請約七百箱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會昨日正式開售人造絲，開價計一百廿號有光及半光天橋牌人造絲，每箱價爲二百八十萬元，一百廿號有光什牌人造絲，每箱價爲二百七十五萬元，此次配售對象，暫以生產廠商爲限，絲織業公會於昨日上午十時前，曾彙總登記申請廠商共計三百十五家，計申請人造絲總額爲六百九十四箱零一包，中信局可望全數照配，又按配售辦法規定，今日各廠商即需繳清全部貸款，惟以時間侷促，業經廠商與中信局商准，於明日中午十二時以前，全部繳清，聞中信局每月配售量，約爲二千五百箱，本月因已過半月，故約爲一千五百箱，下次配售日期，已定爲下週一，據絲識業公會常務理事劉慶一語記者，中信局現定每週配售人造絲兩次，決不中斷，故盼谷同業勿事囤積，俾免自食其果，又現時同業中織物多用七十五號及一百五十號人造絲，盼速改用一百廿號。聞十一月份將續有日本人造絲六千箱到滬云。</p>
<p>又中國紡建公司昨亦有雜牌人造絲三百三十餘箱，與中信局聯合配售，共開三種，計一百廿號有光半光雜牌人造絲，每箱價亦爲二百七十五萬元，一爲五十號半光雜牌人造絲，每箱價爲二百四十五萬元，共售二百零六箱，此次配售對象，以人造絲商號爲主，每家一箱，各廠商本期如有配到，其數量均需在中信局本月份應配各廠商之數量中扣除。昨日人造絲市開盤即弱，一二〇天橋有光喊四百二十萬元，乏人過問，旋即下挫至四百十萬元收盤，下午更虛，喊四百萬元尚無交易，結果比上日短去三十五萬元，其餘各號貨亦莫不下跌三十萬至三十五萬元。</p>
<h3>秈米市價見疲雜糧跌多漲少</h3>

<h3>便交傳說大盛華股先憂後喜</h3>
<p>華股昨情况更爲悽慘，場內交易空前寥落，首熱永紗，亦時有門庭冷落之慨，場外各號恐絕無重振之可能，步跌不已，後市傳說助買突形興旺，自晨開以迄午收每半小時即起一段慘降，中途雖有不少小回頭，無如空方安似泰山，絕無恐慌，買氣終被壓倒，近午都退至低價，臨收小　，午收結果除榮豐中絲麗安五和外，各股各跌不少，午後承收市後餘勢，上場即穩，廣帮有進，局面改觀，同時空方有補，漸漸拉高，加之便交傳說更盛，人心甚堅，隔日交割關係，臨收一反常態，急切扳高甚多，永紗美亞新光勤興信和火柴火通均超過午前高價，惟中絲反破前市低價，結果較前收計永紗景福新光微降，美亞勤興則略升，信和亦微升，冷股中紡榮豐火柴新亞公司各告微挫，大通麗安華豐五和水泥平平，統益中絲景綸內衣各跌半成，前後市成交統計七〇〇萬股，場外各股繼續告跌。</p>
<p>外股初時頗疲，後以外商來進，上市消息濃厚，不一而足，怡紗自八三〇〇元盤升至九〇〇〇元光景，結果較前收計怡紗紙業怡啤亞洲鋼業均有軋漲，英聯微挫，餘者平平。</p>
<h3>挽救茶業　經財兩部互推主管市商會請迅赴事機</h3>

<h3>市督學座談會第二日情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市教育局督學座談會，昨日（十七日）是第二日，仍在育才中學舉行·　督導處主任陳選　·暨督學李卓實·嚴春山·沈業昌·倪培坤·馬靜軒·張廷幹·夏孫鎮·顧大銘·沈逸君·陳　·宋稟恭·鄭傑等二十餘人。陳主任選善主席，略謂：今天上午，請謝循初先生演講中學教學問題，下午請沈亦珍先生演購中學行政組織及設備問題。我們這個座談會，是檢討督導工作之如何進行，特請各位教育專家參加討論。接着謝循初演講。謝說：現在的教學，好像是走到狹的路上去，祗注意學生成績的優劣，而不研究學生成績如何優如何劣。首先說明教要以學爲標準。教與學的關係，在學生如何學，教師才如何教。我們要先研究學的方法，再研究教的方法。並舉文字教學與作文教學兩個實例，分析學生學習的少驟與教師指導的方法。各位督學聽了，均認爲是謝氏從事教育研究的實際經騐之談。最後謝氏強調教育上一切問題的中心就是教學問題。我們要用科學的方法，來解決教學上的困難問題。並謂：中小學教學問題如不獲科學方法的解決，則教學成績，便無法可以提高云。下午沈亦珍演講。沈略謂：關於中學行政組織問題，要有一個基本觀念，就是要人盡其才，物盡其利，錢盡其用，才可使教育行政的效率提高。至於行政組織的因素，不外（一）教育機會擴充，（二）教育科學進步，（三）主管教育行政饑關及其法令，（四）學校的歷史，（五）學校的環境，（六）國家政令的推行，（七）學校的經濟，（八）學校的人才等。我捫要總合起來研究，才能產生合理的良好的學校行政組織。所謂良好的行政組織是什麽？可分（一）分工，（二）職權分明，（三）縱橫聯繫，（四）經濟，（五）人事配合適當五點。再說行政組織如何運用，約分（一）領導得人，（二）全體教師參加，（三）要有檢討的機會，（四）考核四項。接着提出中學設備問題，先說明現代學校擴充設備的原因，不外（一）教育機會增加，（二）國家與人民財富增加，（三）工業發達，（四）教育的標準提高等四個原因。說到設備的種類，介紹美國Koos氏調查一百五十六個學校校舍設備，每一種至少發現三次以上的列入統計，共有一百零九種之多。最後說設備的標準，以美國出版的中學校舍標準一書做例，謂校舍標準可分七大類，（一）位置一〇〇分，（二）建築一五五分，（二）普通設備二七〇分，（四）教室一四五分，（五）特殊教室一四〇分，（六）公共場所一四〇分，（七）辦公室五〇分，總共一〇〇〇分，這是一個校舍評點表，如在五〇〇分以下，就不合格了。這個評點表或可作爲視察上海學校校舍的研究資料之一。講畢，六時散會。</p>

<h3>碧綠的豆田裏　慘紅的大屠殺　常熟西塘橋四十市民血債清算</h3>
<p>— 孫敬治</p>
<p>敵憲的暴行</p>
<p>日前本報讀者董得仁中君來函，曾提及「……塘橋一處有二三十人被敵憲提了川機檢掃射事，」頃接孫敬治君來稿，證實那是一件千眞萬確的事情。孫君係塘橋人，曾親歷過該悲劇，文中把眞實情形，歷歷寫出，其用意殊大：第一，可供軍事法庭參考，第二，可讓世界上正義的人士多明白一點日軍的暴行，第三，也可警惕國人，不要因寬大爲懷而善忘。·編者·</p>
<p>悲壯故事的開端</p>
<p>記者執起這枝筆來的時候，內心不知受了什麼强力的壓抑，悸動得很利害，我不知應該用什麽筆調，什麼字句，才能够把下面的一樁悲壯慘烈的故事沒有一點遺漏的描寫出來。誰都承認日本帝國主義的軍閥是殺人的魔王，在這一次大規模侵略戰爭裏，在前綫，在淪陷區，他們用它們殘酷的獸性，狠毒的手段，曾經殺害了多少無事的同胞，造成了多少慘劇。我這裏所要報道的就是這裏面千萬樁事實裏的一件。</p>
<p>在叙述這故事的開端，第一要表明這一個慘劇是發生在民國廿七年七八月間（月份日子均可攷査）的秋天。那是金風送爽的季節，毛豆剛結實的時候，常熟才淪陷一年，敵人的勢力，祇據有着一個城區，四鄕都在游擊隊手裏。那時候，游擊隊的組織各自爲政，尙無系統，他們的作用一則用來抗日，二則用來保民，（其實，大部多見日軍懼怕，但火拚勒索等情，（尙無發生）所以一般的很受地方人士的歡迎。</p>
<p>塘橋的游擊領袖</p>
<p>塘橋是常熟西門外三十餘里的很大的市鎭，這時日軍很少經過那裏。一方面鎭上自衛的力量也很强，絕無匪徒的聲擾，所以城內或各鄉人士，相率來避居者很多，市面一時稱盛。當時駐紮在塘橋的游擊領袖是龐雲，擁有數百人的武力。（鄕間游擊武力已經算是很大了。）槍械齊備，實力濃厚，所以四方聲譽很大，日軍一面見他威懼，一面想利用他，而龐雲始終兀立不動。有時且跟日軍衝突，（如破壞公路，橋樑等。）當時他的趨勢很有膨漲的現象，各方面歸附的很多，且慢慢的和其他各地取得聯絡，敵人見他很害怕，所以預伏了期滅其部隊的陰謀。在事前，塘橋鎭已有很多關於日軍要來掃蕩的消息。</p>
<p>槍砲擊三面襲來</p>
<p>那一天，淸晨五點鐘，（日子記不淸楚，大槪是陰曆七月廿六日，確期待考。）天色尙未明亮，在塘橋的東方發現了槍聲，繼而南北兩而相繼而來，槍聲愈變愈急，愈來愈近，中間還隔着機關槍連續的怪聲，擲彈筒的轟擊聲。我還記得當時子彈流竄衝擊屋脊的聲音，轟然的小鋼砲聲，奏得有聲有色，簡直使每一個塘橋人都伏在地上發抖。大約在半小時後，天色慢慢發白，槍聲也稀下去，天色大明了，街頭上已換了景色，日軍滿佈了街道，挨戶的搜査抄擾，當時居民都嚇得不敢出外，知道日軍是來掃蕩了。據調查確實的結果：這一次日軍掃蕩衝進街市的時候，全部游擊隊都已走光了，因此他們所搜獲的，僅是些窳敗不能用的槍械以及有游擊隊嫌疑的三人，一個是錢籌臣區長，一個是店員宋文桂，還有一個是正式的游繫隊員。區長的被扣是自己挺身而去的，因爲他要維持地方的治安，不得不出來招待，後來他終於爲全鎭人民犧牲了。店員宋文桂，因爲他的店是鄕間富家，和游擊隊頗有往還，一方面在他的店裏找出了一面全鎮人民獻給龐雲的錦旗，這樣非但宋文桂注定了死罪的命運，且使全鎭的鎭民也受牽連。</p>
<p>日軍第二次掃蕩</p>
<p>日軍發榜安民之後，於上午十點鐘開始了它第二部的掃蕩工作。他把游擊隊平時出沒的處所都放火焚毀，各家各戶的火油木柴，一時洗掠一空，計被認爲匪窟而被燒的有城隍廟，鎭中心的中央旅館，宋文桂的染坊，更有幾家民房，一併被難。當時因爲禁止救火，（事實上無人敢救，）以至被波及的人家很多，哭喊的慘狀，惟狼犬可忍聽聞。</p>
<p>敵人在大肆焚燒之後，爲了要辦別全鎭居民究竟有否與游擊隊通聲氣起見，就强迫全鎭居民至鎭東街梢公路畔，牛尾巴灣，舉行大規模審詢，（筆者家較落鄕，得免不去，）逼令區長錢壽臣從實招供，（當時區長被認爲游擊隊所舉，實爲民衆公推，因錢爲書香望族，且爲善良市民）當時錢區畏自分必死，而且亦無從招起，致頗受鞭笞足踢皮肉之苦。敵憲並曾令其交出鎭長（朱姓，名字待考，現在常熟爲某紗號經理）彼一此職由彼兼任，這樣，朱鎭長才算倖免。日軍逼令宋文桂招供，可憐宋文桂年紀還不過十八六七歲，也無從招起，日憲無法，只得用另外方法審問。</p>
<p>生面別開的審問</p>
<p>審詢的情形是這樣的：日裏叫全鎭居民一個個依次走前來，叫通譯向宋文桂問：「道人認得否？做什麼行業？」如果宋文桂圖答不知道，就算是游擊隊，令其站立一旁，或許你口音不像本地人，情狀舉止慌張，問答不同，亦在遭難之列。（當時蘇北籍理髪師一名，蘇州籍說書先生一人，即爲此罹難。以上姓名皆可考。尤其是那位說書先生，民族意識頗强，此處値得一誌。）審査結果，人羣分了兩個境界：四十多個人站在樹影下，一大羣人站在烈日下。因爲當時他們誰也不明瞭這是什麼意義，，所以呼朋喚友，偸偸的溜去溜來的也有，怕太陽的自動的走至樹影下，區長也立在樹影下，有一個馬姓鄕下人，以爲樹影下是安全地帶，屢次的溜過去，又被拉回來，最後又溜過去，誰能料想得到這些樹蔭下的人就是「該死」的呢？這些寃死鬼，可算是悲劇裏的一幕插曲。（按：馬姓鄉下人爲筆者家內傭工之姪，事屬可靠。）</p>
<p>四十人無辜槍決</p>
<p>審詢完畢後，日憲就把站在樹蔭下的四十餘人，用一條繩綑綁起來，一面向其餘一羣宣佈釋放，並且發表演說：大意爲這四十多人、皆是不良份子，立即槍決，希望其他作好好良民云。一面釋放後，一面把這可憐的一羣，驅策到碧綠的大豆田裏，叫他們跪下來，殘暴的日軍便在公路上架起了機蘭槍，據後來幸脫虎口的一個人回來後講：（這人可考査）當時他們界見狀乞　求救，哭喊的聲浪難以形容。拍，拍，很簡單的幾聲，他們都倒下了。（錢壽臣區長，宋文桂，游舉隊士一名皆在內，餘皆爲老百姓。姓名皆可以考査）暴日完成了他大屠殺的最後一幕，據那個死裏逃生者說：日軍在掃射後，復分頭巡視三四週，有的尙在掙扎者，皆賞以刺刀。（按：此人因伏血屍下，鮮息不動，得倖免。其手指中彈一顆，姓名可考査。）日軍在完成其殘殺後，就分道而去，留下的祇有一陣陣蕭蕭的秋風，和濺在碧綠色的豆葉上的四十多個無辜同胞的鮮血。</p>
<p>悲慘的故事至此完了，記者亦再三聲明。這是一個千眞萬礦的事實。我那時僅有十一二歲，不過幼小的心靈裏對道一件可慘的記憶與年紀一樣的在加深。八九年來，我未曾忘記過，所以絕對可以保證沒有一點失實，我祇白愧不能寫文章，也許我這一篇東西寫得太平儿，不過事實是眞的，事實更緊張，更恐怖，更悲慘。我相信西塘橋的人，對這一椿太可慘的刺激，雖過百年之後也會留給後世的子孫，決不致令其湮沒的。</p>
<p>集寧外圍戰形勢圖（本報資料室特繪）</p>
<h3>集寧會戰前奏曲　五日豐鎮航訊　本報特約記者劉映元</h3>
<p>集寗在平綏路沒有修通以前，只是一個荒涼的山村，原各老鴉咀，僅有四五十戶人家。民國八年火車由豐鎭把枕木舖到老鴉咀後，因爲它的壽字不大著名，便將老鴉咀南面二十里的平地泉的名稱，定爲車站的站名。所以我們在不少分省地圖上，祇看到平地泉，往往找不見集寗。從前的那個平地泉，現在改成了老平地泉。集寗是民國十四年，馮玉祥將軍督辦西北邊防時，把凉城卓資山以東，豐鎭官村以北的地區，在平地泉設治了一個新縣，所定的縣名。</p>
<p>衝要形勢一瞥</p>
<p>平地泉東距張家口三百六十華里，西距歸綏三百二十里，南距大同二百七十餘里，北距外蒙邊境錢以南的滂江四百多里。它好像站在晋察綏三省這幾個重鎭的十字路口。平綏路到達平地泉，愈發增加了它的軍事價値，並且成了一個對外蒙貿易，和集中綏東察北糧產的城市。徐樹錚籌邊時代，就在平地泉建有機塲兵營。馮玉祥將軍更於民國十四年修通到滂江的平滂公路，使它四通人達；南可守護山西的門戶，北可切斷張庫公路，俯視外蒙的動態，左右可以支援察綏兩省的省會。</p>
<p>集寗和歸綏，大同鼎足而立，和張家口，大同也呈犄角之勢。所以共軍在今年一月十三日停戰令下達以後，沒有先國攻大同，而先行强佔集寗，當集寗旣得之後，隨後便發動了對大同的攻勢。如果大同失陷，歸綏就不堪設想。因此國軍爲了解救大同，保全歸綏，不得不收復集寗，共軍爲了圍困大同，鞏固張垣，也不得不保守集寗。於是才引起繼四平街以後的慘烈的集寗會戰。所調集寗大捷，轉捩了北方的危局，其意義就在於此。</p>
<p>平地泉海拔一千四百公尺，氣候特別高亢寒冷，五六月間約夜裏，仍可看見雪花飄飛。火車由歸綏到集寗，和由大同到集寗，都是走着上坡。往西至卓資山，往甫至官村，盡是起伏的丘陵，往東至張家口穿過一片平原，才可進入山溝，往北至滂江，不須要翻梁越嶺，即能到達瀚海盆地。縣城就建築在西南兩面環山，東北兩面有一名叫觀王河廻繞的平灘上面。從東北兩而進攻集寗，很難接近城根，即便由霸王河入城，因受西南兩面山頭的控制，亦無法立足。所以集寧易守難攻。</p>
<p>屛障着集寗的，共有三座名山，這三座山並不怎樣險峻，不過放在集寗城週、就有了軍事價値。因爲集寗城外所有的丘陵，都沒有這幾座山高，在城西的名山呌臥龍山，對正集寗西門，並遮護着西南城角，城南的山頭原各黃家梁，二十六年湯恩伯的軍隊在此處築有很好的國防工事，故改名爲鐵軍山．臥龍山和鐵軍山間的凹坡，日本人曾在佔領期間，建築了要塞化的營房，以補兩山當中的隙縫，城東南的山頭名所老虎山，這個山不但可以俯瞰全城，而且能監視覇王河流過的草灘，二十六年構築國防工事時，隧這，通到縣政府的辦公室地下。</p>
<p>集寗是平綏綫上唯一具有都市規模的縣城。火事由北向南穿城而過，把全城切成兩個部份，鐵道東邊的稱橋東，錢道西邊的稱橋西。馮玉祥時代洲有十八道大馬路，視在僅有八條馬路住着商店戶家，圍圍圈有土打的城牆，城下盡是洋灰鋼骨暗碉。由於集寗過去非常繁榮，並且四郊盡是石山所以城內的建築物相當高大堅固。如橋東的車站，水塔，鐵路醫院，工人往宅，機關車塲，電燈公司，縣政府，和橋西的福者堂，麺粉公司，淸眞寺，郵電局，警察局，蒙疆飯行，祗要堆上土口袋，和安上鐵絲網，都可以變成巷戰的防守工事。</p>
<p>共軍防守佈置</p>
<p>共軍於本年一月十八日强佔集寗以後，即開始整修二十六年以前的國防工事，並加强廿六年以後日寇構築的工事。整整興建了四五個月工夫。他們肪守集寗的作戰計劃，是以少數的精兵固守據點，用大興團迂廻外圍，以吸引國軍到達集寗城下，然後包圍殲滅。今年七八月間，曾調集「晋綏」和「綏蒙」這兩個軍區的部隊，做過四五次攻防演習。他們自信先在卓資山將國軍的銳氣打消，一定可以在集寗城郊把國軍挫成肉餡，包了餃子。</p>
<p>他們原先計劃叫「綏蒙軍區」獨一旅，在卓資山死守兩天，以等待第四旅和敎導旅開到，和國軍進行野戰。誰想獨一旅在卓資山僅支持了兩個半鐘頭，便把佈有六層防禦的工事失掉，向時開到十八台車站的第四旅和走到牛家川的敎導旅，亦遭受到國軍殲滅性的打擊；於是放棄了野戰，把「晋綏軍區」二旅的二十七團，「綏蒙軍區」的第九國，三五八旅的第五團，和「綏蒙軍區」警衛營做了守城部隊。二十七團的防禦位置在鐵軍山，三五八旅第五團在臥龍山，「綏蒙軍區」警衛營在老虎山。此外還有番號不明的一萬多人，由「綏蒙軍區」司令姚喆指揮，固守橋東橋西各個據點。</p>
<p>這一次共軍參加集寗會戰的兵力，據俘虜供稱約有十七個旅，五十一個團，合計人萬多人。我們在集寗外圍所發現的有新四旅，獨四旅，暫四旅，三五八旅，敎導旅，獨一旅，獨二旅和「晋冀察軍區」游單第四縱隊這些單位。共軍防守集寗是把四分之三的兵力分佈在外圍。在卓資山沒收復前，集寗附近的村莊就駐有一晋綏軍區」的全部精銳，到卓資山收復後，將圍攻大同的「晋冀察軍區」聶榮臻的部隊亦大部調歸賀龍的副司令張宗遜指揮，前來參加集寧會戰。</p>
<p>我方進攻姿態</p>
<p>這次集寗大會戰，雙方共有十萬人以上的兵力。我方分三路出發，左翼「復興」縱隊完全是騎兵，由「鐵騎」「靑山」「長城」這三個支隊編組而成一保從武川穿過陶林散佈到平滂公路和豐集鐵路線上，以資一方面阻遏共軍由商都開來的援軍，一方面切斷豐鎭到集寗的述繫。右翼「唐聲」縱隊，是以「回光」「征東」兩個支隊做基幹，配合着「先鋒」等騎兵支隊編組而成，係由歸綏攻破田家鎭（舊寗遠城），直豐凉城近郊，在大海泊平原搜索，使綏東和雁北的共軍無法呼應在一起。　我方主力「勵進」縱隊，率領着「勝利」，「少年」，「黃河」三個支隊，於九月一日沿鐵路綫東進。五日上午「勝利」支隊配合「少年」支隊，將卓資山攻佔後，又翻越鐵路以北的山地，於八日到達集寗西北土城子地區。九日下午就進入攻擊準備位置。十日發動攻擊時，是以「勝利」和「黃河」兩個支隊突城，拿「少年」支隊做預一備部隊從西南兩而包圍城區。當天「勝利」支隊搶下鐵軍臥龍兩山，「黃河」支隊由西突城受阻，「少年」支隊遭受到共軍外圍部隊的波式環攻。由十日下午到十二日上午基膠着狀態。十二日「勝利」支隊佔領橋西，下午「唐聲」縱隊派「國光」支隊增援，經一　夜血戰後，十三日下午軍開始撤退，我方於深夜以後，才完全光復了集寗。</p>
<p>國軍還有一支攻擊部隊，那就是民主保衛工作總隊領導的雁北，察北，綏東三個地區的武裝還鄕人民。這些身穿皮襖頭罩手巾的子弟兵，在集寗會戰中起了很大的決定性的作用。楊員甫指揮的第一總隊和趙大義指揮的第三總隊，使雁北和察北的共軍不能應援綏東。魏純美第二總隊完全加入各路出擊國軍衝鋒陷陣，並包攬了所有的偵察，引路，運送，抬傷工作，使國軍沒有吃到一點大虧反而膺得輝煌戰果。所以傳長官說：「這次集寗會戰的勝利，是人民意的勝利」。</p>
<h3>驚險外圍戰　連續奪取兩山</h3>
<p>國軍主力「勵進」縱隊，於九月十日拂曉，向集寗外團各據點發動攻擊。「勝利」支隊擔任奪取臥龍，鐵軍兩山，「黃河」支隊擔任由西北方向突城，「少年」支隊在黎明以前，就到達駱駝脖　子候家村之綫，做攻城的預備部隊，並保護全軍的側翼。「勵進」指揮所當天亦設在駱駝　子，輕重和給養停留在集寗城西的喇嘛　團。我們攻擊的路綫，是由西北到達西南，然後折向東北突城。共軍的外圍部隊發現槍聲之後，便由東南向西南移動，計劃迂迴到西北形成反包圍的狀態。</p>
<p>攻擊臥龍鐵軍兩山的「勝利」支隊，是以第二支隊攻佔臥龍山，第三支隊攻佔鐵軍山，同時下達的前進命令。共軍在這兩個山頭上，設有七層防禦工事，第一二兩層是地雷錢，第三層是鐵絲網，第四層是電網，第五層仍是鐵絲網，第六層是寬而深的外壕，第七層是環形交通壕圍護的銅筋水泥蘭堡。由山底到達山頭，約有三里多長的距離。這次英勇的國軍都不怕死，頑强的共軍也都不要命，戰鬥進行非常慘烈。我們是以重火器先封鎖住碉堡的射口，然後以步兵踏過地雷電網綫，跳入外壕向山頂猛撲，故傷亡較　戰役爲重。</p>
<p>「勝利」支隊向臥龍鐵軍兩山同時發動攻擊後］爭奪臥龍山的第二大隊，於一小時後就突破三五八旅第五團的陳地。所以共軍把防守鐵軍山的「晋綏軍區」廿七團抽出一部增援臥龍山，並且命令士兵躍出外壕，以刺刀跟國軍進行自刃戰鬥。因此「勝利」的第一大隊受到阻遏，等到第三大隊先將鐵軍山奪下，然後派出一部生力軍，由鐵軍山北都穿過集寗西南城角，如兩座駐有共軍的營房，繞到臥龍山背後，將守山的共軍前後來擊挫碎，才於黃昏以前把臥龍山佔領。</p>
<h3>桂林農村婦女掠影</h3>
<p>— 八日桂林航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>千古多情，風流自賞的賈寳玉底眼裏，女人是一漢柔和的春水，然而，成長在南國邊陲的女人們，在人們底眼裏，却是一株石壁上面的灌木，神秘而又堅强……。</p>
<p>廣西的女人沒有姑蘇台畔金粉的婉約嬌姿，也沒有北地胭脂的麗質天成，從最客觀的審美眼光去觀察一個人的體態，只有健康是她們唯一的優點，粗放得一點細膩也談不上。千百年來除了相傳一個生長在博白村間的綠珠而外，再也聽不到甚麼關於絕代美人的故事，但是我相信你聽到一個女人比男子生活得軍有辦法的時候，總應該會感覺到比美人的故事更美！</p>
<p>整個廣大的農村里，毋論東南西北，從山地而至平原，女人是農事的主力。從耕田播種，而至割稻，從割稻而至冬耕，砍柴，割草，沒有一樣不是女人的工作。男人呢？男人變了女人，他們的工作是挑水，煮飯，送飯，打理家庭，抱抱小孩子之外，使終日無所事事，東面站站，西而坐坐，喝酒賭錢，快活得有如一條猪，（自然也有一部分的男子一樣的和女人通力耕作，不過那却多是貧苦的山嶺地區的事情了）。納糧究租，桃米上市，女人和男子一樣唱着山歌，走向城市。肩上一頂雨笠，赤着大板足，高聳的胸部的跳躍藏着無无限的生命力，再加上一副腓紅的面孔，誰能够說一顆挺直的松樹會比不上一顆弱不禁風的楊柳美麗呢？</p>
<p>「男耕女織」是一句規則的古訓，「女耕女織」也是一件可愛的事實。冬天裏閑暇的日子，女人們用自己的手織成了自己底衣裳，丈夫兒女的新衣，還拿到市而去廉價的求售，而桂東富川賀縣一帶的婦女，則終年靠織布度日，每年八月到十二月紡紗，十二月到七月織布，眞是「鷄鳴入機織，夜夜不得息」，織來的布做成了別人的衣裳，自己却刻苦地穿得又破又爛，所以她們穿衣服有「三年新，三年舊，三年補肩頭」的誇語。更可憐的是多少織女，從機杼上消磨了整個的靑春，爲人作嫁，到頭來，富質一帶變成了多產的老女的愁城。</p>
<p>生長在意識落後，封建殘餘勢力的女人，眞有無限的苦痛，婚姻的買賣制度依舊存留在廣西整個農村而至城市之間，妻子的確像一件衣服，棄留的決定權完全操縱在庸俗的男子漢手上，莊稼漢賣妻子，士大失階級賣妾侍，是一件平凡到再不能平凡的事情點，妻子是一件「動產」只要誰至於只是和一個不相識的男子說幾句話，弗消說得，一噸臭打之後，準得有媒婆上門養人「嫁老婆」。然而丈夫跑到山隴山頭去和別家婆娘唱山歌，喝洒胡鬧，討三五個小老婆，却是天經地義，甚至賭輸錢，或者窮到沒有辦法的時候，拿妻子去押一押，也不稀奇。</p>
<p>由於婚姻的痛苦，再加上女人自己堅强的自立能力，於是鄕村裏普遍產生一種畸形的現象，而且爲官廳法令所奈何不得。這個現象的專有名詞，叫做「不落夫家」。女人嫁到丈夫的家里，三朝七日，便捲起包袱返娘家去，自耕自織，消遙過日，一年回來下定，三五七年回來也不定，有時間到夫家住上三五天，拍拍屁股又溜掉，弄到丈夫有苦沒處訴，因爲不落夫家而起的訴訟眞不少。女人們留在娘家里，德呆不出好事情來，只是一層性的誘惑，便弄到醜事百出，所以有些地方（如桂南·武鳴·都安一帶的鄕間）女人時常在娘家把肚子弄大了，才回到夫家去，而且龐然其身而轉夫家，倒又「瞴哈問題」，因此有一個笑話說：在這些地方見了人，千祈莫喊「大哥」或者「老人」。要不然，你準得挨一頓揍。</p>

<h3>現代醫學上的消化性潰瘍治療（下）</h3>
<p>— 薛邦祺</p>
<p>（丙）其他藥物治療</p>
<p>我們都知道患有消化性潰瘍的病人，尤其是有幽門梗阻現象者，他們的胃肌，常常會發生痙舉狀態。因此鎭痙劑的應用，對於平息徵象，往往頗能收效，可以减輕病人的痛苦。通常所用的鎭痙劑爲阿刀平或顚茄一類的藥物。其他酸性中和藥物如痙氧化鋁，鏻酸鋁，三矽酸鎂等可以酌量情形，替代薛佩氏粉劑應用。</p>
<p>Larostidine（即Histldine）對於消化性潰瘍缺乏特效，早在一九三六年已經美國醫學會指出其低能無用。據Kirby氏之嚴格臨床實騐，其療效尙不如普通之薛佩療法。</p>
<p>近來市上廣吿成藥種類甚多，但絕無特效之可言，切不可因濫用而把自己的疾病遲誤。且有許多藥品，如應用不當，則有損而無益，切不可妄從。</p>
<p>（丁）胃出血治療</p>
<p>胃出血之治療，必須按當時出血量之多少，及其出血之後果而定其對策。依一般而諭，發覺有胃出血情形以後，病人須立刻躺在牀上絕對休息。對有許多病人，往往在出血的時候，恐懼萬分，心神緊張，胃蠕動增加，凡此種種，都是於痛根不利的！還有許多家屬，在病人四週，慌慌張張，鬧得嚴重非凡，反而增加病人的不安，這種態度，是最要不得的！所以爲病人着想，最好謝絕一切親友的探望，給病人好好的休息。即使親密如夫妻，或父母子女者，亦應該很鎭靜的服侍在旁，使病人寬慰。醫務方面，可以酌情注射嗎啡針等，使病人安靜舒適，得着着眞正的身心休息。</p>
<p>在大量出血情形之下，各種緊急措置，如輸血或注射葡萄糖鹽水等均可酌情施用，以恢復體內血量，防止休克及補充失水等重要症狀。惟其應用之方法，時間，數量及速度等，均須經醫生謹愼考慮後，始可進行。不然如運用時間不當，輸量過多，或速度太急等等，均反有增加流血之可能！</p>
<p>飲食方面，通常於血止二十四小時至四十八小時後始漸漸進食。在禁食時間，如病人奇渴，可將小冰塊含於口中，以後之飲食，可嚴遵上述之薛佩氏飲食調理法進行，惟起初之容量，還須减半。</p>
<p>有許多醫生囑置冰袋於胃部，可以停止流血。此種措置，亦須斟酌病情而行，如病人已呈休克現象，或冰袋之應用而使病人發生寒戰，則結果非但無益，而適得其反。</p>
<p>市面上有許多止血成藥，我們應用的經騐，對於胃出血並無特殊效用，此點與國外專家之意見相同。切不可倚之而忽略常規治療，以致殆誤大事！</p>
<p>（戊）外科治療</p>
<p>消化性潰瘍之各種手術療法，本文無意相提並論。惟於何種情形之下，應攷慮手術治療，茲可節列如下：</p>
<p>（一）急性胃或十二指腸穿破。</p>
<p>（二）慢性潰痬穿孔或胃周圍炎後而胃成畸形者。</p>
<p>（三）潰瘍而有惡性腫瘤變化者。</p>
<p>（四）幽門阻塞而確有顯著飲食潴留情狀者。</p>
<p>（五）屢次出血而內科治療無顯進步者。</p>
<p>（六）慢性潰瘍而對於其他各種療法失去效用者。</p>
<p>（己）最近許氏介導之高度滋養治療</p>
<p>（一）許氏高度滋養治療之開展消化性潰瘍之治療，自一九二三年薛佩氏發表之著名療法以後，近二十餘年來，並無出奇的革新可言。直至最近數年，國人許肇推氏於美國研究蛋白質新陳代謝時，發覺高度滋養之應用，對於治療消化性潰瘍，收效奇佳。從此在治療上又露一角曙光，亦爲我國醫界之光榮。</p>
<p>許氏今春回國過上海時，曾對醫界同人發表其一部份之研究工作。緣最初時，許氏曾以決定施用手術之消化性潰瘍病人四例，給以高度滋養治療。目的原爲輔助病人之體力與營養，希於手術時得所補益。惟所出人意料者，四日以後，病人之胃痛，忽而消減，病狀平息，竟可自動步出醫院，而無需再用手術或繼續治療矣。觀於此種異乎情常的優越成績，許氏遂即繼續有規模之消化性潰瘍高度滋養治療研究。所得結果，益能證實其療法之優越，而受各國醫界之注意焉。</p>
<p>（二）許氏高度滋養療法之原理</p>
<p>許氏用氨基酸（蛋白質水解產物）附加葡萄糖和麥芽糖代替病人之全部飲食。此種高度滋養療法之原理，許氏本人曾說明如下：（一）氨基酸（蛋白質水解產物）有胃酸中和作用。（二）氨基酸或蛋白質水解產物是已經消化的蛋白質，無需再勞胃臟，故可使胃及十二指腸上部有充分的休息。（三）營養豐足，可以增加瘉合能力及速度。</p>
<p>（三）許氏高度滋養療法之應用</p>
<p>許氏對於應用方法，亦有一定規則，茲可簡述如下：</p>
<p>應用藥品—（一）Amigen（含百分之十二氮）。（二）葡萄糖及麥芽糖。</p>
<p>劑量—（一）每公斤體重，每日配以百分之六十公分單位之氮量，即Amigen五公分。（二）例如病人體重五十公斤，則每日需Amigen50×5=250公分。（三）每公分Amigen含熱量三。七卡，則海日服Amigen所得之熱量爲250×3.７=925卡。（四）設病人每天需熱量二千卡，則不足之熱量2000-925=1075卡以葡萄糖麥芽糖補足之。其每日需量爲1075+4=269公分。</p>
<p>服法—把每日劑量，按病狀分作八九次，每二小時服一次。用永冲調之。</p>
<p>治療日期—先服兩星期，然後酌情辦理。</p>
<p>許氏的高度滋養療法，我們因本地藥料缺乏，無從作有規模的應用，其效果如何或優越至何等地步，我們現在不敢斷言。據許氏最近選擇治療之六十三例結果：特優者有四十七人，甚佳者十三人，失效者十三人。然此類病人，均屬其他藥物治療完全失效之例，今日許氏有如此成績，不可調不優，而較已往之治療法，惑勝多矣。</p>
<p>許氏所治病人爲期尙短，痊瘉後將來有否復發機會，現在難於預斷。而許氏本人，亦曾一再明示他的高度滋養療法，現在僅可使進行性的潰瘍轉入痊瘉之途，而並未有確定必能根治之意。高度滋養療法，現已引起各處醫界之注意，將來能發揮至如何地步，則有待繼續研究之進展焉。</p>
<p>以上所述的治療各節，部有互相密切連繫關係。洽療時務必面面週到，不可顧此失彼。在治療期間，病人的合作，忍耐，信任醫生，和具長期治察的決心，都是成功的要素！我們同情病家在治療上的種種困苦，希望在不久的將來，醫界能有更新的開展，來縮短治療時期，減少治療的困難。</p>
<h3>略知皮毛最易闖禍</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>—爲訓練中醫事與本市衛生當局商榷—</p>
<p>西諺有云：A　Little　Knowledge　is　Dangerous　Thing，意思就是本題的略知皮毛最易闖禍，實在是一句至理名言。小孩子們的容易闖禍遭殃，就是吃了「略知皮毛」的苦。</p>
<p>十月三日大公報載：本市「衛生局以吾國中醫墨守舊法，缺乏新知，擬扶助中醫公會舉辦講習，俾對化學，物理，生理解劑，藥理，病理，生物醫藥等，有所了解』。</p>
<p>這個消息如果屬實，而眞的實施起來，那就無異于把原子彈交給小孩子們去玩，一樣的危險，一樣的不合理！</p>
<p>中醫要科學化，除非把中醫全部放集，沒有第二條路。因爲文化是整個性的，而科學尤其是整個性的，不整個性的不系統化的就不是科學，張之洞的『中學爲體西學爲用』政策，已經斷送了滿淸，窒息了民國，吾希望賢明的當局不要再中此毒。自然，衛生當局訓練中醫的政策，恰恰與相反，是要『西學爲體中學爲用』，但其違反科學整個性，造成斷章取義的假科學，却是並無二致。道是基本上不妥的一點。</p>
<p>再就實際言之。舊醫的特點是玄，說得好點是哲學化，說得眞切點是糊塗化。而科學醫的特點是精確，一是一二是二，一些也不得馬虎含糊。需要良好的高中訓練（程度差一點的根本考不進醫學院）加上六年以上的嚴格訓練，其程度比較普通大學要高二年至四年。這樣的長期嚴格的科學訓練是絕對必要的，因爲醫生處理病人的健康，病人的生命操諸其手，所以一定要訓練得達到『知得澈底』的階段，否則略知皮毛便易闖禍了。現在衛生局希望于短短時間，將科學醫的精華傳給沒有良好的高中科學訓練的中醫，不僅是不可能，並且有極大危險。</p>
<p>在醫學院內將科學醫傳授給受有科學訓練的醫學生，尙且困難重重，資質稍差者往往再留班，終至隊各。現在要用短期講習的方式，希望能使陰陽五行玄之又玄的中醫科學化，道等於綠木求魚，癡人說夢。</p>
<p>如果硬要推行，則勢必造成大批似科學非科學的變相『西醫』，於是一切罪行均歸諸『西醫」。</p>
<p>道地的『中醫』用用藥性溫和的草根樹皮，尙無多大危險。但是這種變相的『西醫』似懂非懂地來應用科學醫的藥物與其他治療方法，則危險更甚。</p>
<p>因爲科學醫所用的藥物，或係草根樹皮之精華，或係合成之化學品。尤其最新的種種特效藥品，多有猛烈之藥力，欲得其最大之療效而避免其有害之副作用，必須作準確之病原診斷及種種試騐，始克有濟。至於種種診斷與治療方法，均須經過嚴格之專門訓練，始能得心應手，不致錯誤。</p>
<p>今欲試以此種科學醫之精確知識與陰陽五行頭惱之中醫，即不格格不相入，亦必造成大批略知皮毛之變相西醫，其危險將何堪設想？</p>
<p>要中醫科學化，必須把中醫全部放棄然後打起科學根基，來接受科學醫的全部訓練。此外，沒有第二條路。中學爲體西學爲用的政策是行不通的，應用到醫學上來更是危險之至，危險之至！</p>
<p>抗戰前目都軍方某要人之死於某中醫的隔衣注射法，抗戰期內陪都某要人的幼子死於某中醫的嗎啡針，均是所謂『中醫科學化』的例子，希望大家知所警惕。</p>
<p>最後更希望本市衛生當局放棄這種冒險的嘗試。</p>
<h3>消化性潰瘍之危機</h3>
<p>— 鐘學禮</p>
<p>消化性潰瘍俗稱『胃病』，其危機所在，可分體內與體外二方面述之：體外者殃及國家社會與家庭眷屬，體內者則爲患終身，隨時皆可解致命之禍害。今姑分項略述於後：</p>
<p>甲，體外者：消化性潰瘍極爲普通。我國尙無可靠之統計，據英國Hsrst與Srewart二氏之估計約有十分之一人口在生平某一時期由患此疾病，可見此病之普通程度，幾不亞於有活動性之肺癆病，故實爲大衆之公敵。所幸大部分患者，經急性時期後，於不知不覺中自行痊愈；一小部分患者，則不幸而變爲慢性之消化性潰瘍，經年累月，精神上體力上均爲之影響。此病之普通性雖無男女老少之別，然以生活環境等等關係，往往男性多於女性，前者幾四倍於後者。年靑人士，工作頗重，精神緊張，志　前進，行動敏捷者，患者尤多。對於個人之事業，家庭之經濟，社會國家之進步上均不免要受極大損失。</p>
<p>乙，體內者：消化性潰瘍除爲害人羣外，於患者個人有如下幾種可能發生之危機。危機之發生，更可別爲急性與慢性二種；急性者於病者不知不覺中暗暗進行，達病情嚴重時期，始發現其症象，恒以時機坐失，以致治療上發生困難，甚或變成不治痼疾。今姑述其梗槪以警惕國人，冀有所防患於未然，或及早妥治。</p>
<p>急性危機</p>
<p>（一）出血：常消化性潰瘍侵入胃腸壁深處，蝕及血管，管壁壞死，釀成出血。如出血少量，患者可不感任何痛苦。敏感者，可能發現大便呈深赭色，甚者作柏油危（烏黑而光亮）。是時病家毫不介意，照常工作，久後大量血崩，嘔血，便血，同時並進，以致於工作時期，昏厥倒地，不省人事，手足冰冷，冷汗遍體，脈搏頻數，呼吸短促，形容蒼白，血壓下降。斯時也，始感慌張，送人醫院，則病者已入頻危之境。如能幸免於難。速　　血，成可獲救，否則此將僅之　　，實非擊石所推挽救者也。</p>
<p>（二）　孔：患　胃消化性潰瘍者，隨時皆可得此穿孔之危機。　孔後，更進入腹膜炎，以致死亡。死於消化性潰瘍者中，約有百分之六十五以上出於此嚴重之　　症十二指腸潰瘍穿孔數較胃腸穿孔者爲多。穿孔患者初起時，常訴驟起劇痛，繼續不已，由上腹部反射至後背或肩部，其痛度與性質與往常局異。醫生檢査時常發現病者　容呈頗痛狀，臉色蒼白，呼吸短促而呼吸　動限於胸部，四肢寒冷，身體僵直而不可稍動，腹壁壁堅硬如木板，捫之恒示劇烈觸痛。穿孔一二小時後，臉容由白而紅，體溫漸上昇，四肢由冷而溫，腹部漸膨脹，呼吸更短促，脈搏更快，是時入反應期而腹膜炎發生矣。如病者於數小時內躭擱時機，膽怯而拒行修補手術，大都不治而死於腹膜炎。縱用最新之配尼西林及血漿等亦屬徒然。穿孔及出血同時發生者的佔十分之一，其嚴重性自屬倍增。</p>
<p>慢性危機</p>
<p>（一）阻塞：消化性潰痬大都患于幽門附近（即由胃通至十二指腸之要道），或以肌肉痙攣而幽門緊閉，或以慢性發炎，或結疤或瘤腫而發生阻塞。患者往往訴嘔吐病史。上胃部痛楚，經嘔吐後方可解除。吐物常大量，含有數日前所進食物。且飲食往往减退，營養受障碍，以致消瘦，憔悴，虛弱，貧血。</p>
<p>（二）胃癌：十二指腸潰瘍大都無癌　變化，而胃潰瘍則不然。據病理學諸家之屍體解剖結果，胃潰瘍變成胃癌者的有口分之五左右。得胃癌後更可發生流血，幽門阻塞，及腹膜及肝臟之轉移性癌腫等，以致不治。且往往於早期症象不著，僅有消化不良，胃納欠佳，體重銳减、待至病者發現，往往已入難治階段。是等患者生命僅一二年而已。即能早期開刀割除，大都亦不能延長至五年以上。</p>
<p>（三）葫產胃：慢性消化性胃潰瘍位於胃上綠（小弧）中部者可以胃形改變成葫產狀，稱之曰葫蘆胃。是等患者常有數年以致數十年之胃病病史，上腹部更形膨脹，隱痛，繼而嘔吐發生，消化，食慾皆不振，出血，穿孔，阻塞亦可發生。</p>
<p>（四）胃腸炎：胃腸炎可致消化性潰瘍，而消化性潰瘍亦可兼有慢性胃腸炎。病者食慾常欠佳，消化受抑制，上腹部亦有輕度不舒感。此等患者，胃酸常較低，治療較困難。</p>
<p>（六）胃腸週圍炎：當消化性潰瘍進行潰爛，入於肌肉及腹膜基層而未穿孔前，或其進行極緩時，則往往刺激胃腸週圍組織，引起慢性週圍炎。於是病者向有之胃病性質，程度及地位皆與往日有異。若潰入胰臟外層，則常有右下背部隱痛。如時機久長，發炎之後果常爲瘉着粘運，則毛術進行時更有困難矣。</p>
<p>（六）胃腸瘻管：如消化性潰瘍進行至腸胃週圍炎，更與大腸瘉合粘連後，發生穿孔，則成一瘻管，大腸直通胃腔。如發生嘔吐時，往往有糞便吐出，而食物下嚥後，未經消化。數小時內即行淺出。於是患者食而不化，更不能有所吸收，營養自感缺乏。貧血，虛腫等等隨之，使外科治療發生困難。</p>
<p>綜上所述，消化性潰痬之禍書所及，小而一身，大而社會。是以早期診斷與合理治療實爲要務。希潰痬患者爭取時機，勿再因循自誤。</p>

<h3>古書畫的真偽問題</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>略論歷代書畫展出品</p>
<p>這一次中國文物公司主辦歷代書畫展，一方面是給上海市民一個欣賞的機會，一方面也是給書畫家一個考騐。</p>
<p>賞鑑書畫，最難的一關是辨別眞假。眞假之所以難辨別，並不完全在好壞。假畫不一定是壞畫。有很多假畫是大名家作的。眞畫不一定是好畫。一個名家荒率苟簡之筆，往往被後世的人認爲是假的。諸如此類，因素極多。所以賞鑑家遂不得不從旁再考騐紙和絹的時代，印章的色澤和尺寸，如翁方綱辨別趙子昻的眞偽全憑那圖章上子昻的「子」字頭上有一點缺陷。但作僞者正往往在這種地方作得使人死心踏地，又將奈何？於是賞鑑家的條件是，第一，他自己是一個讀書人；第二，他自己是書畫家；第三，他對於某一家或某一時代特別精熟；第四，他在這圈子裏吃的虧多。他的鑑定不僅憑紙絹圖章等等物質外形的證據，而更憑他的靈感和眼力。這是賞鑑家之所以高出古董販子的一點。但，眼力仍不十分精確，頂多不過七八成把握。所以一切古器物中，以書畫爲最難辨識。最精的鑒家也很難下確切不移的斷語。（假使他眞誠地虛心而負資）大概說來，好壞比較到眼可知，眞假比較不易武斷。審愼的賞鑑家多半不肯輕易說眞假的。</p>
<p>以上的話，是就純客觀的鑑賞來說的。加之，古書畫的收藏，在在與銀錢有關。這其中含着極複雜微妙的人情世故。所以涉及眞假問題就使人更難開口了。在一次宴會上，有人拿出一軸古畫。某一位大老快意之中說那是假的。後來，大老知道那軸畫原是一個人想賣了作旅費。因他這句話而生意不成。從此以後大老追悔自戒不再說眞和假了。</p>
<p>這次展覽會中出品很多，前後兩次去看都沒有買目錄，走馬看花，回家就忘記。大約第二次的還記得一些。歐陽文忠的那封信眞好。這次展覽會中字幅不多。吳原博的詩軸好極了。周天球的行書也精彩，那轉折頓挫處，盡見筆勢。記得好像是絹本，似乎更易顯露筆鋒。文衡山直幅雖也好，但非精品。馬湘蘭情書幾通眞是一大允物。其情致之纏綿眞至不待言，即其筆畫也秀勁有味。其中有一些字寫得不成一個結構，（例如「曾」字）但仍有意致。筆畫細處，很像「派克五十一號」所寫，但今日小姐恐怕很少有人能寫這樣的信。那巨然「茂林疊嶂」的一幅，曾見寳迂閣著錄。這據我看，確是一張舊畫。一茂「茂林羅嶂」四字，有的說是米南宮所寫，有的說是米虎兒。總之，這四個字倒寫得不壞。董文敏的山水小橫卷（小楷書其昌款，後有楊龍友跋。）眞是精品！使人流連不忍去。黃鶴山樵夏日山居，精品！，倪雲林兩幅，好極。並且紙地也乾凈。陳老蓮絹本太幅授經圖，甚精彩。由此可見此公對於唐畫的確用過功。最奇怪的是那件石濤的山水大長卷，爲甚麼那樣矜重？姑且斗膽說一句是假的吧。但如若以前兩段所說眞假難言的原則可以成立，則這卷畫說似說眞的兩方俱各負一半責任可也。</p>
<p>最後還有一事，想說幾句。這次展覽會雖經努力，成績不差，但仍不能謂爲成功。主持者的努力也許還不够，而收藏家的捨不得出品，應該是原因之一。許多藏家未將銘心之品拿出。即以我的孤陋寡聞而言，便可隨手舉出一例。例如黃鶴山樵的「靑弁隱居圖」，據聞藏魏廷榮先生處，何以竟未能感覺？這輻畫即是董文敏所題「天下第一王叔明畫」並有董公書倪雲林贈王蒙詩於共上。黃鶴山樵的畫除了在姚公綏（明人）家被燒却的「岱宗密雪圖」乏外，似此烜炬赫之品，幾於難以比並。如若容許大家瞻仰，實於文化藝術有功，而於藏家亦有益無損。現在上海治安絕可無處，而主持其事者在地位上說，是當局，在身份上說，是君子，又絕無被巧取豪奪之懼。也許寳愛之甚，不忍隨意展閱以免損傷。但此困難只要謹愼地請好手從事，必易解決。希望下次展覽會，我們觀衆有這種眼福。</p>
<h3>跋田寄翁畫都嶠山水長卷</h3>
<p>— 許紹棣</p>
<p>寄翁作畫，得宋元人家法，所寫山川景物，有反正，偏側，聚散，遠近，內外，虛實，連斷之妙。故神靈俱備，有形有勢；縱橫呑吐，不落板腐雕鑿之病。　濟所謂：『山川脫胎於余地，余脫胎於山川也。搜盡奇峰打草　也；山川與余　過而迹化也』。君蓋其奧矣。此圖渾樸高古，大氣磅磅，蒼渾中寓雄奇，挺秀處不失其遒勁）；信手輝來，使成奇峭幽遂之境。想見其見形取情時，筆端自有金剛軒也。昔張大風臨覽昌平天　館山，而畫益工；秦舜友入大台，松針石脈，逈然有異。寄翁曾漫遊奧西，縱覽桂林諸山水，吾於斯圖有同感焉。</p>
<h3>張大千的艶詩</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>鰲人張大千，二十多歲，即留鬍子，長髯過腹，很像美髯公；今年已是四十四歲了。風流跌宕，和友人談天，好作幽默話。抗戰前年，游歷高麗，和韓女春紅相戀，彼此間雖不通言語，然在會心處，則相與啞然笑，可說是客中旅邸的因緣。大千會繪畫册，留作紀念，畫册錢後一張，是畫着晒衣架掛着新洗的紅素兩件女衫，砧邊蹲着一個女子，停杵凝眸，充分表現思念遠人似的。大千題有小詩云：</p>
<p>「歡如洗紅裳，</p>
<p>洗紅日日淺；</p>
<p>儂心似洗素，</p>
<p>洗素素不澹。」</p>
<p>他又有贈春紅詩：</p>
<p>「夷蔡蠻荒語未工，</p>
<p>那堪異國訴孤衷；</p>
<p>最難猜透尋常語，</p>
<p>筆底輕描意已通。」</p>
<p>再贈春紅云：</p>
<p>「新來上國語初諎，</p>
<p>欲笑佯羞亦太憨；</p>
<p>硯角眉紋徵蓄慍，</p>
<p>壓他俗客亂淸談。」</p>
<p>他倆的情意纏綿，芳心脈脈，活躍在眼前。我曾問他這宗艷事，凝素夫人知道嗎？大千即在抽屜裏拿出和春紅合攝的儷影，畫師美人，相映成趣。照旁寫着寄凝素夫人詩兩首，詩云：</p>
<p>「觸諒躊躇怕寄書，異鄕花草合歡圖；</p>
<p>不逢薄怒還應笑，我見猶憐況老奴。</p>
<p>依依惜別痴兒女，寫入圖中未是狂。欲向天孫問消息，銀河可許小星藏？」</p>
<p>野心勃勃，在字裏行間跳躍，藝人風趣，可見一般。</p>
<h3>安定居士造像序</h3>
<p>— 夏敬觀</p>
<p>明淸以來傳神寫照，約分二派，師曾波臣者，有謝文侯，沈爾調，徐象九，張于遠，子遠子德思，願仲會，郭無疆，徐瑤圃，顧靈程諸人，此以古爲今，自成家數。與萬愼齋白描，兩觀微暈脂赭，雖非相師，同一源也。師焦秉貞者，則冷吉臣，崔象州，莽卓然，金介玉等，自攝影術東來，繪像者大率焦派，古法蕩然無存矣。</p>
<p>安定居士胡君亞光，得外家戴文節之傳，雅搜丹青，遂兼習西畫研討寫貌之法，與曾焦二派，取長舍短，　　乎欲別樹一幟。昔朱竹垞述曾派門徒之語曰：「方其未得，若有所膠於中而不釋；及其旣得於心，若飛鳥之過日，其形之去我愈疾，而神愈全。」胡君蓋有會於斯言矣。</p>
<h3>談楹聯</h3>
<p>— 山定</p>
<p>中國藝術以書法爲最美，楹聯爲書法之最美者。取集古人詩中一二語，或寫景，或言情，書以名筆，懸之室中，晤言相對，如親聲欬，如晤古人，此最雅道。</p>
<p>寫楹帖不可摺格，否則必如排子，索然氣盡。又不可不摺，七言尤難，往往落筆四字寬暢，後三字幾無位置者，但將紙中間一摺，將落筆時先加審度。將四字寫過，摺少許，則下三字恢恢有容。若五言八言，皆易位置，無待經營。</p>
<p>寫楹帖必要磨得墨濃，蘸得筆飽，七寸之管搦筆三寸，解衣懸腕，揮洒自如，樊樊山馮夢花皆坐而書聯，所以氣畫。</p>
<p>寫楹帖筆要長鋒。黃山谷云筆錄三寸，露穎三分之二，入管一寸，余嘗情工爲之，露穎二寸易，入管一寸難。今之筆工能入管三分者，已爲國手。筆根不強，此字畫之所以不至也。求之其次，法用大筆，含蓄有餘地，亦過半矣。</p>
<p>寫楹帖要懂蓄墨法，能從頭至尾，一筆寫成者，聖手也。四字一停，三字補足者，能手也。一二字一醮筆者，品斯下矣。</p>
<p>寫楹帖不可用蠘箋，久而蠟去墨蝕，糢糊一片。不可用藏經箋，久而如霉如腐，尤不美。金箋珊瑚箋宜先用細布擦，不可用粉拭，能使墨色暗澹。玉版箋夾貢皆滯筆，生宣紙則濫筆；似以淸水煮硾爲最宜。若舊紙則無所不宜，何待擇選。</p>
<p>寫楹聯落款最難，上款當在第二字間起，下款常在第四字下，宜在寫聯字原筆題好，不必俟乾易筆再題；則氣盡矣。</p>

<h3>吳昌碩與齊白石</h3>
<p>— 大木</p>
<p>近代國內的兩大畫家，南方當推吳昌碩，說到北方，那是要算齊白石了。</p>
<p>吳昌碩逝世已有十餘年，從前日本人最重視他的畫．他的號呌苦鐵，別署缶廬，起初是在蘇州賣畫，到民國初年始來上海，住在一家題襟館裏，那時知這他的人還不多？後得黃賓虹介紹，與日人落山氏訂立合同，在落山花園寫畫，一面落山氏替他在報上吹喧，從這時起，他的名氣就大起來，可是吳所得的潤資，一半須分給落山氏，後來求吳畫的人越來越多，他的畫稿搜羅盡了沒法對付。就把墨汁醮紙上，依着汁形而改作，說是個法子中國古時有的，名曰「化境」。吳除畫外，且擅金石，題畫的詩，更是蒼勁可喜！如題水仙花云：「苦寒天氣一花開，讀罷離騷仔細猜，却似奇窮孟東野，低頭下拜有誰來？」又如題楓云：『一樹斜陽下，吟詩繫客舟，吳江久不到，因畫憶前遊。』</p>
<p>齊白石現尙健在，年齡已有八十六歲，住居北平，仍替人寫畫，他出身很苦，幼年是習木匠的，後靠自己的努力，埋頭學起畫來，不到十年，他的畫名大震，達官貴人，紛紛也求他的畫，可是他的脾氣很古怪，如果他所看不起的人，雖出重價，也不給他查的，因着他的骨氣高，求他畫的人越多，所以他幾十年來賣畫的收入，聽說已薄有資財了。前年日人佔北平時，曾要他寫畫，他關起門來，寗願餓死，日人對他也無可如何，只得笑笑走了。他所居自名曰寄萍堂，前歲我曾看到他的一詩云：『凄風吹袂異人間，久住渾忘心膽寒，馬面牛頭都見慣，寄萍堂外鬼門關。』一股憤懣之氣，躍於紙上。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　66</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我們自管談話，信步已經走到車站出口了，回頭一看，見那幾個傢伙，並沒跟過來，倒是站在那炎交頭接耳，開起圓桌會議來了。這時車子已經發出開車汽筒聲，綠旗已經揮動了。正在這一剎，祗見那商人打扮傢伙，說了最後一句話似的，一揮手，竟自上了車。</p>
<p>「咱們上了當哪！」虎弟急促說，「要上車還來得及，小姨您看？」他的大圓眼珠子滑碌碌直轉，一閃一閃地發出光芒來，瞧了瞧開走的車，又瞧了瞧呆在車戰邊的三隻巡狗。</p>
<p>「算了罷，」我握住了虎弟的骼膀，「咱們瞧瞧他們還能唱點什麼戲，倒要君他一個究竟……反正十來里地，也許僱得到小汽車哩！」</p>
<p>「唗！」虎弟對巡狗們吆喝着，「怎麼哪？」</p>
<p>三隻巡狗，那挨了唾沫的打頭，其餘兩隻，拎着咱們的東西，裝出，走了過來；不過這種勢子，同車上那種其勢洶洶的氣燄比起來，已經成了强弩之末了。到了咱們跟前，也不作聲，一逕向出口外走着。</p>
<p>局子就在車站外面，是一個派出所。那位小所長，見了咱們這一起，睜大了眼睛，有些不知所措的情形，倒反請我跟虎弟，在辦事處像貴賓似的坐下了。這一來，呌我嘔得要笑出來了。</p>
<p>小所長把我們安頓下了，便　分問那三個傢伙有什麼事，那挨揍的把所長拉了一把，朝所外面走去，因爲這裏祗有一間屋子。四個人都出去了。虎弟要去聽他們說什麼，我勸他不必費心，因我知道這個局面是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>果然不到幾分鐘，小所長已經踅了進來，帶了一臉的惶恐，又裝出一種尷尬的笑容，好像有些牙痛似的。那搶包裹手提箱的兩個，像賊似的，跟在後面，輕手輕脚，把東西放在那惟一的條桌上，轉身就要「脚下明白」。</p>
<p>「站住呢！」虎弟陡然一喝，聲音雖是尖嫩，却還有些威嚴；因爲尖嫩裏而，帶着一股剛勁。</p>
<p>「去罷，去罷，」小所長寒起臉來，連迎揮着手，「這裏有我哪。」</p>
<p>我也拍了一虎的手，意思叫他別嚇唬他們了。兩個傢伙眞像夾尾巴狗似的，耽着心思，走出去了。</p>
<p>「您二位上城裏去？」小所長好像在對上司說話，「這是眞的一大天誤會哪，……可耽誤了您二位的車哪……我總得盡力，替您二位想辦法，那怕呌小汽車呢？」</p>
<p>「那沒關係，」我定了主意，要打聽他怎麼一個究竟，「可是得有一個條件，不然的話，別說汽車，就是放花車，派飛機，還得要咱們肯走哩！」</p>
<p>「我聽您的，」所長又放出那副牙痛的笑容，「您是明道理的，我是事外的人，你知道，我可沒參加這個局面……您小姐有什麼條件，儘管開下來，我盡力最辦……」</p>
<p>「怎麼？」虎弟瞪起眼睛來，「他們這起渾蛋，都不是你放走的？怎麼說？」</p>

<h3>姜公美</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>姜公美兩彈畢命於宋公　，姜公下塲實在不美矣。</p>
<p>記得去年上海接收時盛况的人，當不會忘記那時狠天狠地的這位大憲兵隊長，他的皇大吿示，他的出入之凜凜威風，他的部下之樣樣管，時僅一年，景物全非，許多僥倖漏網的人，雖然還在逍遙，但精神上怕也有慄慄之感罷！</p>
<p>人們有點弄不明白的，就是這件案子幾乎延長到一年的今天才判決，起初判爲無罪，後來改判五年半徒刑，最後又改處死刑，死刑與無罪，其間的距離相差太大了，是不是在輾轉京滬渝三地審判期中又陸續發現他的罪證呢？還是最初的偵査不足呢？</p>
<p>姜公美死有餘辜，假使他早知道今日一件運動衣，一條西裝褲子倒在荒地上汨汨流血，那些金條和汽車洋房對於他又有何用。</p>
<p>偶·咸·雜·談</p>
<h3>「民意」</h3>
<p>— 奚奴</p>
<p>不日前某處曾舉辦過民意測騐，爲一大漢奸緩頰，發表票數，贊成緩刑，儼然民意所歸，在此盛言民主之世，此一傑作，與猶太人製美國玻璃褲帶一般一時幾可亂眞；但不幸終被唾棄，徒貽羊頭狗肉之藏。茲又發現某處舉辦一測騐，叫人就（一）我贊成美車駐華，多多益善；（二）我要求美軍立即退出中國；（三）我無所謂，美軍駐不駐在中國，與我無涉，三內定答案中任擇一條。只要是中國的國民，不問男女老幼，不問職業或有無業，均可參加發言，希望愈普遍愈好，可由讀者輾轉徵求投寄，不識字的，可請人代寫云云。試一考：鄙人份屬「中國的國民」，自然不能置國是於不顧。不過這問題出得太妙，第一條或可以有限制，有時間性的贊成，但所添尾巴『多多益善』實非人民本想，於是第一條只好不要，至第三條，當然任何人都不肯塡用。那麽•兩路不通，只剩下第二條可　，就是『我要求美軍立即退出中國』了。這樣，不待揭曉，其第二條答案，當屬絕對中選無疑，而與×黨之秘密文件强調美軍在華劣行（如軍車肇禍之類）以惹致人民對美軍之惡感，達成撤退在華美軍之目的一款悉　付節，一經以『民意』出之，（有票爲證），自屬順天應人，名正言順了。</p>
<p>我們要喊尊重民意，因爲民意是大衆神聖的呼喚；但我們不忍看見『民意』被假借，被愚弄，被出賣，被褻凟，被利用！老百姓是不能跟着人家的臭尾巴做應聲虫的，我們不愛看這種技巧拙劣的戲法。</p>
<p>如一定要求其普遍，旣可輾轉徵求投寄，筆者雖亂爲識字者流，對此國家宏猷，也賽過有眼瞎子，只好像選舉參議員一般就煩請該時局問題的主考官駕輕就熟『代寫』一通了。</p>

<h3>測字</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>敝友某君，今年三十五歲，十月十日生。年年此日，親朋們總要爲他慶賀一番，他在表面上雖然接受了他們的好意，但因爲眼見家業日替，百事多乖，內心未免悶然。所以在今年初度之後，便去請敎一位測字先生，以卜流年，而問休咎。</p>
<p>那位測字先生用的「雙測法」，就是要你連寫兩字，拼攏來一起拆，敝友即景生情，便在水板上寫了兩個「十」字，測字先生問了來意，略一沉吟，便道：「直言莫怪，照字義講，「十」是全數，也就是滿的意思；易言滿遭損，現在兩滿相加，必損無疑；老兄在從前或者前世，也許曾經風頭十足過，但現在恐難如意了！」</p>
<p>「以形式言，「十」即是十字架，是耶穌敎徒用來表示哀悼的記號；也是醫院的標記；又是十字軍的臂章；都是不吉祥的東西，依此推論，大的老兄府上，不是傷亡頻頻，便是疾病纏綿，或者是訟事連年不解，將有傾家蕩產之危！」</p>
<p>「假使把十字位置歪斜，就變成一個「×」，×是不對的表示，而且又是一連兩×，顯然老兄的做人之法，很有不對的地方，還得多多改善！」</p>
<p>那位測字先生看敝友不聲不響，認定談言已中；以後的事，便是其信口開河，一瀉千里，但也着實鼓勵規勸一番：</p>
<p>「這個×字，在商業場中，又是四的代表，××就是四十四，那末老兄一定要到四四三年，才有否極泰來之望；但現在三十五到四十四，足足還要十年，在這十年之內，非得埋頭苦幹，努力生產不可；此即十年生聚之義，蓋所以培養生機，恢復元氣，爲將來發揚開展之基，則前途又未可限量也。言蓋於此，請恕　直。」</p>
<h3>倘若我是市參議員</h3>
<p>— 羅保</p>
<p>倘若我是市參議員，我對上海市政府的財政難題。一定要想出一個兩全的辦法，使市政府不致入不敷出，同時，市而的繁榮不受影響。</p>
<p>有人提議恢復　馬，但是反對的人更多，這一個辦法，不能實行。</p>
<p>過去在「工部局」經當支絀的時候，有人建議發行市政獎券」——仿照從前的「航空獎券」，「慈善獎券」辦法，將餘款充作工部局經費。但是，後來沒有實行。我以爲這個提案，在目前恐怕不容易通過。</p>
<p>那末，爲了平衡市政收支，難道祇有增加人民負担—提高各種捐稅的一條途徑嗎？（裁汰冗員，效果甚微，不是根本辦法）</p>
<p>站在一個市民的立塲，你贊成娛樂捐一再增加嗎？你同意房捐，警察捐，營業稅……步步高升嗎？</p>
<p>倘若我是一個參議員，我一定主張將本市的足，籃球名手聘爲市政府及其附屬機關的職員，在他們公餘之暇，每星期內舉行比賽一次至數次，槪售門票，收入盡量撥充市政經費。</p>
<p>這是提倡體育，不是賭博，誰敢反對？誰反對就是「摧殘體育」。你以爲這個辦法怎樣？</p>
<h3>善·變</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>姜公美貪汚案，由無罪，而改判徒刑五年半，忽然又判決死刑，已經在本月十四日執行。</p>
<p>姜公美的死，沒有人替他可惜。不過本案的一再改判，令人不解，難這在全部案情未盡明瞭以前，可以任意判刑的嗎？</p>
<p>不久之前，在報上讀到淸査團在廣州發現了一件驚人的「蔽余案」，九月二十三日起出後淸點數量，計金質磚二十三塊，每塊重約五十斤，經過化驗，證明含金的六一成份。藏金地點係漢奸張榮孫的產業，早經標封接管。</p>
<p>本月八日，上項金質磚在廣州中央銀行公開化騐，由中山大學鄭曙民敎授以科學方法化騐，結果認爲僅含銅鋅成份。金磚成了廢銅，淸查團撲了一個空。</p>
<p>上述兩案，在未得全部眞相之前，未便妄加評論，我們似乎祇能暵一聲：「善變！」罷了。</p>
<h3>提倡吃草</h3>
<p>— 徐榮</p>
<p>從前巴比倫的國王，尼布楚尼沙，曾經拋棄了他的皇宮，跑到草塲去和牛馬一起大吃其草，所以許多人很可憐他，以爲他是神經錯亂的瘋子。但是他究竟不是瘋子。假使他是在春天吃草的話，那時的草正是發芽的時候，非常幼嫩和新鮮，那末，他所吃的草包含百分之四十的蛋白質，其營養價值與牛排不相上下，而大豆則顯然遠不及草的營養豐富。而且，他從草裏更能吸收大量的各種維他命。</p>
<p>美國甘蕯斯州研究食料公司代表斯納倍爾氏，最近參加美國化學學會會議裏極力讚揚草的高度營養價值。根據這位先生研究的結果，幼嫩和新鮮的草一割下來的時候比較後來成熟而割下來的包含更多量的蛋白質，其營養價值不下於肉類和牛乳；可是草所包含的蛋白質在質地上是更優良的。質地優良的草裏面所包含的蛋白質在營養價值方面比牛乳强得多了。</p>
<p>這位先生還懂那些農天爲什麽要等那麼長久時候才來割草。像平時那樣割草，那些草早就失掉大部分營養價值了。等到慢慢曬乾之後，又要失掉了更大量的維他命。他的結論是：早期割草而且把它迅速　是保存草裏的高度營養價值的不法二門。</p>
<p>研究維他命的朋友們和吃慣觀音土的難民，不妨改改口味來提倡吃草，可以飽腹充飢，延年益壽！</p>
<h3>零零碎碎</h3>
<p>— 罔悟</p>
<p>中國人愛老什麼遠年太雕，紹興卅年陳酒，老山人參老老大房，老牌××……不一而足。文人署名用甚麽室主，山人，居士…之類；大有倚老養老之槪。名義上我們可以不管，現世界應當究其實質，若果是老當益壯，我們應當敬老。但少年老成，大可不必。倘民主時代還有老爺的話，那眞是老而不死！</p>
<p>嘗觀察一個孩子的睡態，口眼閉攏，微帶笑容，眞是最美麗的！而一個大人過了四十，睡着還張開嘴，或則半開着眼，面目可怖，又是另一種感覺。</p>
<p>不知老之將至，我們該趁早努力啦！</p>
<p>「如有褪色，包退包換」，</p>
<p>「壞一隻，換十隻」，</p>
<p>「不顧犧牲血本，完全討好主客」，</p>
<p>此生意經也，上海商人皆能背誦如流，考其價值，尙不及「靈不靈當塲試騐」，比較地體面些兒。</p>

<h3>指責蘇聯的共產黨員　「克拉夫欽哥」小史</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>（編者　：克氏最近指責史達林之言論，遍載中外各報。）</p>
<p>就他的經歷和行爲來說，維多。克拉夫欽哥（Victor　Kravchenko）確是一位使人注意的人物：他是一位蘇聯的公民，共產黨員，更曾經担任蘇聯政府的高級官吏。他今年四十一歲，一直居留本國境內，在一九四四年因公派赴美國，忽然在美國宣布脫離蘇聯共產黨，最近，他又到了英國，在倫敦的報紙「世界新聞」上撰文，指責史達林積極備戰，並且提出蘇聯的外交，內政政策，作爲證據。克拉夫欽哥的言辭舉動，無疑地，已經引起國際間的重視。</p>
<p>早年加入共黨</p>
<p>維多•克拉夫欽哥，一九〇五年誕於俄國烏克蘭的葉喀特林諾斯拉夫（Yekatcrinoslav）地方，他的父親是當時的一個革命黨員，所以，他自幼已經受到革命思想的感染，那時尙在沙皇黨政時代，保皇與革命，形成兩派在武力與思想上的對立，不久，一九一七年的俄國大革命來臨，他目覩白俄與赤俄，混亂紛爭的內戰，當史達林在一九二九年，宣布國內反叛勢力全部肅淸的時候，克拉夫欽哥設盡方法，方才得到允許，加入爲共產黨員。</p>
<p>克氏本來是一位工藝學者出身，他擅長冶金術，同時，他對於黨務也是非常熱心推動，因此，他曾被國人目爲蘇維埃工藝界的明屋，受盡愛戴推崇。</p>
<p>懷疑蘇聯政策</p>
<p>但是，當蘇聯在十月革命以後，頒佈「廢除土地私有」，和「產業國有」的法令，因此發生了嚴重的農業生產問題，造成饑饉的惡果。克氏開始對蘇聯的政治施策，起了懷疑，但是他和其他成千成萬的蘇聯人民一般（據克氏本人所述），祇能將所有的懷疑心理戴放自己的胸中。第二次世界大戰發生，他被派被充紅軍的工程隊長，後來調入人民委員會中服務·一九四四年四月四日，他奉蘇維埃購置委員會的派遺，赴美國洽購貨物，他借了這個機會，以爲脫離虎口，便在美國發表脫離蘇聯共產黨的聲明，這一種驚人的行爲，使克拉夫欽哥登時成爲美國新聞界重視的人物，關於他的一舉一動，半言隻字，都被刋在美國報紙的封面版上。</p>
<p>我選擇了自由</p>
<p>留居美國以後，克氏埋首著作，在今年初，完成了他的第一部著作「我選擇了自由」（IChoseFreedom），內容係忠實地叙述他個人的政治生涯和私生活，對蘇聯國內農村生活的眞實情况，頗多揭露，是一本頗有價值的資料著作，如柬要想了解克拉夫欽哥的爲人與政治見解，不妨一讀，並且可以可以助瞭解蘇聯國內的實况，因爲這册書是一位生長在蘇聯三十九年的蘇聯共產黨員，身經日覩的忠實報道。</p>

<h3>Government Political Consultative Conference Representatives Arrive in Shanghai to Invite Various Party Members to Beijing; Optimism Pervades the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and three others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM via China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. At the airport, Mr. Wu told reporters that he was here as a government representative to the Political Consultative Conference, inviting various parties, factions, and social elites in Shanghai to go to Beijing for discussions. Representatives from the Third Force of the Political Consultative Conference had hoped that the government would express its position on the ceasefire and send personnel to Shanghai. Now that the Chairman's message has been announced, and we have arrived here. Mr. Shao Lizi strongly avoided speaking, only smiling and repeatedly saying, "Your news is truly accurate."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu then met with our newspaper's reporter at his residence, stating that since the Chairman's message was published, people in the capital have become more optimistic about the prospects of peace talks. In this message, the government has already made significant concessions, such as on the issue of communist controlled defense zones and so-called local political power. When Mr. Wu mentioned the military actions in Zhangjiakou, he said in an extremely mournful tone that the National Army's attack on Zhangjiakou was truly a last resort, a painful matter to discuss! If the Chinese Communists could faithfully implement the two ceasefire orders of late January and June 7, or agree to the government's proposal for a ten-day ceasefire on the Zhangjiakou front, why would it have come to this! Military issues cannot be resolved simply with the word "ceasefire." How to achieve a ceasefire still requires negotiation. The proposal for a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou was intended for this purpose. There is still one month until the National Assembly. If the eight measures outlined in the Chairman's message can be implemented, an informal five-person meeting should be held as soon as possible to discuss government reorganization. Simultaneously, a three-person group should be formed to resolve military issues, and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should complete its unfinished work on the constitutional draft. Then, all of this should be summarized and submitted to the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group for discussion. Then, convening the National Assembly in one month will surely lead to a satisfactory resolution, and the meeting date should not be affected.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked how the defense areas for Communist troops in the Northeast would be determined, Mr. Wu replied that they would still be determined according to the June Zhaojun Plan. When asked why the list of National Assembly representatives was delayed, Mr. Wu said that the government was truly waiting for various parties to submit their lists. As for the Youth Party's nomination list, Mr. Wu said he was unaware of it. Mr. Wu also expressed his hope to bring back the Chinese Communist Party's list of representatives when he returns to Beijing.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu and others will first exchange views with representatives from the Third Force and will likely visit Zhou Enlai on Sunday. Their return to the capital is likely to be next Monday.</p>
<p>Third Force Representatives</p>
<p>Discussed for a Long Time at Fan Garden</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, representatives from the Third Force discussed for a long time at Zhang Junqin's residence in Fan Garden. After Mr. Wu arrived, Mr. Zhang visited to talk. It is heard that the Third Force representatives have scheduled a banquet for Mr. Wu and the others tonight.</p>
<p>[Huizhong News Agency, Our City Report] This morning, a reporter inquired at Zhou Enlai's Shanghai office for news. The response remained a concise "no comment," with the added explanation: "It's too early in the morning, we have only seen the newspaper reports."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Report] According to reliable sources, when the central government discussed the Chinese Communist issue on the 16th, Lei Zhen had just returned to Beijing from all directions and was summoned to report. The gist was that President Sun entrusted him to convey the suggestions of various parties in Shanghai. After exchanging views with the Shanghai Democratic League, the Youth Party, social elites, and representatives from various factions of the Political Consultative Conference, they reached a general agreement. However, after contacting the representatives of the Third Force and the Chinese Communist Party, they still hoped that the government would first make a clear statement of willingness to cease fire, and it would be best to appoint one or two government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference to Shanghai for consultations to show sincerity. If so, everyone could return to Beijing to reopen peace talks, and the opportunity could be expected to mature quickly. After Mr. Lei's report, some committee members advocated that the government should openly express its willingness to cease fire, as long as the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and various parties immediately go to Beijing, peace talks can be reopened immediately. The Chairman further clearly instructed that the government can issue a message, declaring the government's consistent tolerance and sincere efforts to seek peace. Once this news spread, the atmosphere of optimism in Beijing has intensified in the last two days. This afternoon, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen went to Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign people have great expectations.</p>
<h3>Wu, Shao, and Lei Visit Various Parties to Conduct Informal Meetings; Chinese Communist Party Representatives to Participate in Discussions Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Yesterday afternoon at 2:50 PM, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on CNAC flight 112. After disembarking, they only explained to reporters that they were commissioned by the government to come to Shanghai to continue exchanging views with various parties and social elites, and to urge them to go to Beijing as soon as possible to resume discussions in order to promote the realization of peaceful unification. They then got into their cars and returned to their residences to rest. At around 4:00 PM, Wu, Shao, and Lei visited the Youth Party, the Democratic League, the Chinese Communist Party, and representatives of social elites in Shanghai for brief greetings. At around 6:00 PM, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and representatives of social elites invited Wu, Shao, and Lei to dinner in Fan Garden. After dinner at around 7:00 PM, an informal meeting was held. In addition to government representatives Wu, Shao, and Lei, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Jiaju, Yang Yongjun from the Youth Party, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun from the Democratic League, and Hu Zhengzhi and others from social elites participated. First, government representatives reported that the government has the greatest sincerity in realizing peace, and explained that the eight measures proposed by the Chairman are completely integrated with the opinions previously proposed by various parties, hoping that representatives from all parties will go to Beijing as soon as possible to resume discussions in order to promote the early realization of peaceful unification. After the report, representatives from all parties welcomed the government representatives' visit to Shanghai and continued to exchange views on the overall situation of peace. It dispersed at around 9:00 PM. After the meeting, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and representatives of social elites again sent representatives Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junli, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and Hu Zhengzhi to visit Zhou Enlai at the Chinese Communist Party office at around 10:00 PM to convey the government's views and further mediate. They returned at around 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM this morning, representatives from the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social elites will invite government representatives to a meeting, at which they will report on the visit to Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, last night and exchange views. At 12:00 PM, the three parties will invite government and Chinese Communist Party representatives to lunch. At 6:00 PM in the afternoon, government representatives Wu, Shao, and Lei will invite representatives from the Chinese Communist Party, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social elites to dinner. At around 7:00 PM, an informal meeting will be held, with representatives from all parties participating in order to comprehensively discuss the overall situation of peace.</p>
<h3>Issue of Government Committee Appointment Terms</h3>
<p>Currently During a Period of Negotiations with Various Parties</p>
<p>Standing Committee Decides to Postpone Discussion</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Report] The term of office of the Government Committee was originally set at three years, the same as the Chairman's. Whether the current committee members should be re-elected or reappointed when their terms expire was submitted to the Standing Committee's regular meeting on the 16th for discussion. It was generally believed that the issue of reorganizing the government is currently being negotiated with various parties, and the situation has entered a delicate stage. Therefore, it was decided to reserve the case and postpone the discussion to show the Kuomintang's sincerity in expecting various parties to participate in the government. Therefore, the rumor that the term of office of the current Government Committee has been decided to be extended until the government is reorganized at the National Assembly is not true.</p>

<p>People of the World Unanimously Loathe War</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th Report] US Ambassador Stuart Delivers said in a speech at the Rotary Club here today, vigorously advocated "world culture," which is a single supranational government. Ambassador Stuart expressed his deep hatred for the ongoing war. He also expressed in a straightforward manner that he believed that the psychology of the people of the world's loathing of war is even more certain than the expectation of peace. The people of the Soviet Union, like the people of the United States and other countries, do not want to see war again. He also emphasized that the people of the world all expect peace, and the people of China are no exception, because the people of any country view it as such. He fiercely criticized those who advocate war rumors, "that is, those who often say that a third world war is inevitable." Those who are accustomed to spreading rumors say that the Soviet Union and the British and American forces will fight. Ambassador Stuart also put forward the theory of "international democracy," that is, "world consciousness generated from our own selves." He believes that the new world structure should be a whole, in which countries can cooperate with each other without interfering in the politics of other countries.</p>

<h3>Truman and Bernays Discuss US Policy Towards China; Marshall's Return Home Will Have a Significant Impact</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 17th Report] After Secretary of State Bernays returns home from Paris, he will handle various important foreign policy issues. How to make China internally unified under the central government is one of the issues. Special Envoy Marshall's return home will likely have a significant impact on US foreign policy in China. It is reported that Ambassador Marshall's return home is very likely because he needs to report to the government. From the overall situation, the Department of the Army favors the United States strengthening its assistance to the Chinese central government, while some members of the State Department, on the contrary, favor reducing this assistance, forcing the central government to continue to make concessions to the Chinese Communists. The nature of this issue is important. President Truman specially canceled the regular press conference today in order to discuss it with Secretary of State Bernays at length.</p>

<h3>National Army Counterattacks in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Offensive and Defensive Battle Reopens; National Army Heading North from Anyang Reaches Linluoguan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Report] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway began a counterattack southward at noon on the 17th. By 5:00 PM, the vanguard had forced the recently lost Songlin Store. Upon hearing the news, the Communist troops at the station withdrew in advance and ambushed two platoons. The station can be recovered on the evening of the 17th. This time, the National Army's counterattack adopted a steady approach, ensuring that recovered areas would not be lost again. The Communist troops still used their method of avoiding the real and attacking the empty. On the morning of the 17th, they gathered considerable troops and approached the Zhuozhou and Yongle stations from both sides, attempting to achieve a restraining effect. In the east of Gaobeidian, more than 20,000 people have also gathered since last night, with a tendency to reinforce along the Gaobeidian-Songlin Store Avenue. The offensive and defensive battle in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has reopened. It is reported that Zhoukoudian, west of Liulihe, has been captured by the Communist troops, and the branch line has been completely destroyed. It has been proven that the attack on Yuanshi County and the station south of Shijiazhuang by the Northern Army is inaccurate. According to traffic statistics, from September 29 to date, the Communist troops have destroyed a total of 100 kilometers of railway in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, nearly 60 iron bridges, railway tracks transported to the mountains, sleepers burned, and the roadbed dug into a curved ditch two meters wide and one meter deep. It is estimated that it will take a month to completely repair the entire section to be able to operate.</p>

<h3>General Chen Reports on Military Affairs at Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Beiping; Reporter Group Arrived in Huailai Yesterday Evening for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Report] At a press reception on the 17th, General Chen Cheng declared: After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, the government hopes to resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party through political means. If unfortunately a military solution must be used, he believes that it can be resolved in as little as three months or as long as five months. It does not necessarily have to take 20 years as Zhou Enlai said. General Chen is very optimistic about the military situation, believing that the Communist troops are unable to counterattack Zhangjiakou. Datong is also not in danger of being captured again. Currently, the Zhangjiakou and Huailai passes on the PingSui Railway have joined forces, and the road between Zhangjiakou and Datong will definitely be opened within five to seven days. Those who are disrupting the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are local Communist troops and will be cleared up in the short term. As for restoring traffic, it is said that if the government uses military force to open up the Jinpu and Pinghan railways, it is estimated that it can be achieved in two weeks. In answering reporters' questions, Chen implied that the next target of the National Army would not be Yan'an. When answering the question of whether the National Army would attack Yan'an, he repeated his previous remarks in Nanjing, saying that Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde are one battlefield, but he did not include Yan'an. When a reporter asked whether the government would open up the traffic to Yantai in order to restore maritime traffic, Chen replied that if the Jinpu Railway is opened up, Yantai would not be a problem. Chen reviewed the battle of Zhangjiakou, saying that the troops of the 12th War Zone attacked Zhangyuan unexpectedly, which resulted in the first victory. The importance of the recovery of Zhangyuan lies not only in its strategic position but also in its economic value. In the future, after the PingSui Railway is repaired, food can be transported eastward, and coastal yarn and cotton can be transported westward, which is of great importance to the lives of soldiers and civilians. Chen estimated that since June, the Communist troops in Guannei have suffered at least 200,000 casualties, among which the Li Xiannian's troops have suffered the most losses. Although the Communist Party can use "mobilization" to replenish its personnel losses, the loss of weapons and ammunition and the disintegration of combat morale cannot be replenished. A reporter asked whether domestic military conflicts might lead to international disputes. Chen replied that the Communist Party had said that the National Army's siege of Zhangjiakou would trigger the international situation, but in fact no such incident occurred. At present, all countries in the world hope that China will be peacefully unified. General Chen's press conference was held at the Beiping Foreign Affairs Building at 5:00 PM on the 17th. More than 50 Chinese and foreign reporters attended, and it lasted for an hour and a half before it ended.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huailai, 17th Report] A group of 15 Beiping reporters arrived in Huailai at 5:00 PM on the 17th to inspect the battlefield.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 17th Report] There has been no war in Shandong Province in recent days, and the areas controlled by the government are increasing, which gives the people unparalleled comfort. Traffic on the Jiaoji Railway is being repaired day and night, and commercial traffic between Jinan and Qingdao has been opened, but the unreparied sections of the road temporarily require the use of manpower. There are still more than 100,000 Communist troops left near the sides of the Jiaoji Railway, who have temporarily stopped attacking the National Army, but the authorities have reported that Lin Biao recently transferred more than 10,000 elite troops from the Northeast, concentrated in Dalian, and landed in Yantai and Longkou, attempting to attack the Jiaoji Railway again. The National Army is investigating and preparing. The main force of the Communist troops in the area north of the Jiaoji Railway, south of the Yellow River, west of Boxing, and east of Jinan has withdrawn and is completely under the control of the National Army. The National Army can reach the vicinity of Boxing and has recovered Qingcheng County. The National Army in southern Shandong has recovered the traffic line between Oucheng and Zaozhuang.

<h3>Trade Between China and Britain Should be Resumed as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Speech by Chairman of the British Chemical Industry Association</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 16th] The Sino-British Chamber of Commerce recently held a dinner party here. Sir McGowan, Chairman of the British Imperial Chemical Industries Association, said in his speech that he eagerly hoped that China and Britain could resume trade as soon as possible and exchange goods. If China and Britain do not exchange goods with each other, China will be unable to develop and improve the living conditions of its people. China's long and heroic war of resistance has won the world's infinite admiration. But the impact of war is longer than the war itself, which can almost be asserted. As for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the United Kingdom has generously contributed a lot. In the past, the United Kingdom invested a lot of capital in China. As far as our company is concerned, it has also helped China develop its dyes and other chemical industries. But before China can realize industrialization with the help of the United Kingdom, we would like to see China's political situation stabilize. Therefore, the British Imperial Industries Association does not want to invest in factories in China before China's political situation can stabilize. Unfortunately, the current domestic situation in China has not yet stabilized, and the financial laws and regulations promulgated by the Chinese government have not yet met the reasonable needs of foreign investment. British industrialists are deeply concerned about the unfairness of certain tax rules in China and the large-scale tax evasion by some illegal businessmen. Tian Xi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, stood up and replied that he firmly believed that maintaining friendship between China and Britain would greatly benefit the stability of the world situation, and that he would always promote the relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The original judgment of the first war criminal, Takashi Sakai, by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense has been printed and translated into English, and distributed to the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal, and the embassies of various countries. According to President Shi Meiyu of the court, all parties expressed satisfaction with the trial of the case. The case of Takashi Sakai is actually equivalent to hundreds of cases, because it involves a wide range of evidence and investigation, which has taken a lot of effort. However, our purpose in dealing with Japan's crimes of aggression is not revenge, but to kill one to warn a hundred, and to deal with war criminals who violate humanity with great care. This is the spirit of our court.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Time, Oh Time, Will Not Return! — Hoping the CCP Will Carefully Not Miss This Last Good Opportunity</h3>
<p>At this time when the current situation is approaching another important turning point, we feel particularly gratified after reading Chairman Chiang's announcement regarding handling the current situation, which was released the day before yesterday. The release of this announcement reiterated the government's fundamental stance of consistently adhering to a political solution for domestic political problems. At the same time, it emphasized the urgency of the national people's desire for peace, adopted many opinions from other parties, and fully expressed the government's consistent desire for a ceasefire. The release of this statement truly holds profound significance in handling the current situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we explore the reasons behind Chairman Chiang's release of this announcement, we will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the government's sincerity for peace. This understanding will be further strengthened by the visit of Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen, representing the government in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, which will allow us to hold optimistic views on the future of peace talks. Recalling the developments of the past four or five days, President Sun Ke carried suggestions from third-party figures from Shanghai back to Nanjing on the 13th and presented them to Chairman Chiang on the 14th. That evening, Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), came from Nanjing to Shanghai. On the 15th, he spent the entire day in Shanghai visiting representatives of various parties and factions, as well as socially prominent PCC representatives, exchanging opinions in the hope of jointly urging CCP representatives to come to Nanjing to discuss and realize peace. On the morning of the 16th, Lei Zhen returned from Shanghai to the capital and attended the Supreme National Defense Council, reporting on the results of his consultations in Shanghai. He said that all parties were willing to do their best to mediate and enable the CCP to continue peace talks with the government, but hoped that the government would first make a kind of ceasefire statement in order to gain the trust of the CCP. If one or two government representatives from the PCC could be sent to Shanghai to invite them, it would be even more promising for a harmonious outcome. This is the reason for Chairman Chiang's announcement of significant concessions the day before yesterday and the reason why Wu and Shao, along with Secretary-General Lei, came to Shanghai yesterday to consult. Understanding this process will surely strengthen our belief that the government genuinely desires peace, and its sincere attitude should be able to move even metal and stone.</p>
<p>Because the government holds such a broad-minded attitude, the government seeks peace so urgently, and the people, after eight years of war, yearn for recuperation and rest as much as a great drought yearns for rain clouds, we expect that any party should put aside their grievances and make peace, turning swords into plowshares. The appeal issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to the CCP and representatives of various parties yesterday, urging them to come to Nanjing for discussions, truly represented the voice of the people. We have no other words but to appeal to the CCP representatives to come to the capital on an appointed date and have open and honest discussions. Today should not be a time for empty calls for a ceasefire, but a time when everything is ready, and we should all practically agree on specific measures for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire. Today, we are not concerned about when the ceasefire order will be issued, but about when any political party will express its sincerity in abandoning the use of force.</p>
<p>Now that all parties believe that as long as the government makes a statement on the ceasefire issue, it can elicit a positive response, lead to the reopening of peace talks, and enable a comprehensive solution to the deadlock, then Chairman Chiang has already declared in his announcement that the government is prepared to issue an order to cease military conflicts, as long as there are concrete measures. This demonstrates the government's sincerity in wanting to cooperate with all parties. In order to reach a state where the cessation of conflict can be guaranteed, the military three-person group must resolve the issues of the communist army's stationing and the unified organization of the communist army into the national army by an appointed date. Only when the stationing of the communist army is resolved and the unified organization is completed can the cessation of conflict be truly achieved. At the same time, to resolve domestic political disputes, the informal five-person meeting must be convened simultaneously with the military three-person group meeting, and the agreement of the five-person group must be submitted to the PCC's comprehensive group to reach an agreement in order to carry out the reorganization of the national government, so that all issues related to politics and military affairs can be resolved. As for the various issues regarding the draft constitution, a Constitutional Draft Review Committee should be convened immediately to review it quickly so that it can be submitted by the government to the National Assembly as a basis for discussion. At the same time, as the National Assembly is scheduled to convene, the Communist Party should also submit its list of representatives as soon as possible. Therefore, the eight points listed by Chairman Chiang in his statement are truly concrete measures to achieve a comprehensive and permanent cessation of conflict and to deliberate on resolving domestic political disputes. If the Communist Party truly strives for peace and unity for the sake of the country and the people, it should emulate the wisdom of the Indian Muslims and the spirit of the Congress Party in resolving grievances and making peace, change its course decisively, and order its representatives to come to Nanjing for discussions immediately to promote the realization of peace.</p>
<p>The government has already opened the door to peace widely and extended the hand of peace. Although the CCP's beliefs are different, they are still part of China. At this time and in this place, they should know where they stand. Time, oh time, will not return! May the CCP carefully not miss this last good opportunity!</p>

<h3>After the Restoration of Traffic Between Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Gaoyou, Passenger and Freight Transport is Extremely Frequent. Thirteen Ports Along the Yangtze River North and South are Opened for Civil Aviation.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang office on the 17th] After the restoration of traffic between Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, and Gaoyou, freight transport is extremely frequent. In Gaoyou, high-quality rice is priced at 20,000 yuan per stone, and medium-quality rice is 18,000 yuan. In recent days, the food transported south from Gaoyou has been continuous. As a result, rice prices in Zhenjiang and Erdi have already shown a downward trend.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nantong office] The Pacification Commissioner, in order to ensure the safety of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, had previously announced the closure of several ports. Recently, in order to facilitate the commercial transport of civilian ships, it was newly stipulated that the following thirteen ports along the north bank of the Yangtze River—Ren Port, Tiansheng Port, Xiaoli Port, Bawu Port, Tianxing Bridge, Kouan, and along the south bank: Pupu, Fushan, Shiyi Port, Dongjie Port, Tian Port, Shen Port, and Shuanglong Port in Yangzhong—are open for navigation.

<h3>Disputes Over the Allocation of Seats in the Wuxi Council Election. The Chamber of Commerce Expresses Its Intention to Withdraw and Not Participate.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi office] The election of formal councilors in this county has been completed, and the preliminary work of examining the qualifications of candidates for public office in Classes A and B has also come to an end. Regarding the issue of seat allocation for county councilors, the county government has decided that the 199 townships in the county will produce 100 councilors, and the remaining vocational groups will produce 43 councilors. The method of joint elections in various townships has been announced and should not encounter any difficulties. However, regarding the 43 seats for vocational groups, the allocation of seats to various vocational groups should be calculated according to the number of members in each vocational group, as stipulated in the election regulations for councilors promulgated by the Ministry. However, the number of members in each vocational group in this county varies greatly, leading to divergent opinions on the allocated number for this provision from all parties. Subsequently, the county government temporarily calculated and allocated seats in accordance with the aforementioned regulations based on the statistics of the number of members in each vocational group, and then gathered opinions from all parties and sent personnel to the province for instructions. The planned number of seats for each group is: 22 for labor unions, 12 for farmers' associations, 5 for chambers of commerce, 3 for educational associations, and 1 for free professional groups. However, the county chamber of commerce believes that if allocated in this way, the rights of those engaged in industry and commerce to participate in politics will be excessively restricted and deprived. In order to implement the spirit of democracy and the original intent of legislation, they have specially telegraphed the Ministry of Interior, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Department of Civil Affairs, referring to the National Assembly representative election law, which stipulates that the number of representatives produced by vocational groups such as labor unions, farmers' associations, and chambers of commerce in all provinces should be equal, and requested that it be quickly promulgated. Supplementary regulations stipulate that special circumstances may be handled flexibly to conform to the actual situation and demonstrate fairness. At the same time, free professional groups such as the local journalists' association, lawyers' association, and medical association also expressed dissatisfaction and jointly submitted a request to allow the five groups included in free professions to be elected separately in order to demonstrate fairness. Yesterday, at the eighth meeting of directors and supervisors of the county chamber of commerce, this issue was raised for discussion by Chairman Qian Sunqing, who believed that industry and commerce are the main source of all taxes and donations, and that the nature of regions and groups is different. In the current democratic era, the establishment of public opinion organs is intended to seek reasonable representation for each region and profession. If the number of vocational seats is not evenly distributed, the chamber of commerce will have no choice but to withdraw from participating in the election. After unanimous agreement, it was decided to withdraw and not participate.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Suspends the Collection of Police Donations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiaxing office] The local Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the donation collected by various counties had already been clearly ordered by the central government to be suspended. However, the Jiaxing County Tax Collection Bureau had included the item of donation in the amount of housing donation collected, which the public could not afford. They telegraphed the executive Yuan requesting a clear order to stop it in order to relieve the people. It is now known that the Executive Yuan has approved the telegram to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the county to suspend the collection.</p>
<h3>Mingguang Checks Household Registration and Captures Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Jiading also conducts surprise checks</p>
<p>[Report from our Mingguang office] A household registration check was conducted in Mingguang Main Street Town late last night. A Japanese Railway Corps technical soldier, Roja Matsukichi, was captured in Cao Fu Bao. He was taken to the town office and transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiading office] At 11 p.m. on the 13th, the county government's military section, together with the county security team and the garrisoned Jiading Parachute Brigade, conducted a surprise household registration check. Thirteen thugs posing as public officials were captured in the Nanyang Hotel and the residence of the traitor Chen Fuxiang outside the South Gate, and a handgun was confiscated. They then went to Nanxiang, Huangdu, Anting, Fangtai, Waigang, and other places to conduct checks and captured several more thugs and three short guns. They were immediately sent to the county government for investigation. It is reported that these thugs are related to the car robbery case on Yuan榻 Bridge in Nanxiang this time.</p>
<h3>Changshu Farmers' Association Requests the Opening of the Baimao Sluice Gate to Drain Accumulated Water from Farmland</h3>
<p>[Report from our Changshu office] The local county farmers' association stated that the county experienced a violent storm for two days and one night in the latter half of last month, and the low-lying farmland was flooded. In addition, because the water level of the Yangtze River is higher than that of the inland rivers, the Baimao Sluice Gate has been closed until now, and drainage has become even slower. It is now approaching the autumn harvest season, and the accumulated water in the fields is still more than one foot deep in some places. Farmers not only have difficulty working, but also easily get sick from standing in the water all day as the weather turns cold. They have specially telegraphed requesting that the Baimao Sluice Gate administrator be instructed to investigate the water level of the outer river and inland rivers and open the Baimao Sluice Gate when the tide passes in order to facilitate drainage and benefit the autumn harvest.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Land Price Standards Are Deemed Too High by the Provisional Council</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office] The local Land Consolidation Office was ordered on the 21st of this month to estimate the land price standards in the urban area. After convening relevant agencies for joint assessment, it was assessed and divided into fifteen grades, with the highest price being 20 million yuan per mu. This evaluation is the basis for future land value tax collection. However, the set price is much higher than the current market price. Compared with the price set in the tax deed two months ago, it is also more than ten times higher. The people have just survived the disaster and will be unable to bear the burden. Local residents Fan Junbo, Zizheng, and Song Zicheng requested a re-evaluation. At the same time, the local public opinion organ, the Provisional Council, also invited County Chief and Zhang Zizheng, the director of the Land Consolidation Office, and other relevant personnel to hold a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 15th to review the matter. The Land Registration Office firmly stated that there could be no changes and declared that the government had clearly ordered the land administration agencies to handle the investigation and estimation of land prices. It then publicly read the prices set for each level in the county, pointing out that they were estimated at a lower level compared to the 80 million yuan per mu set in Zhenjiang. As a result, a fierce debate broke out in the meeting. The councilors stood up one after another, denouncing the Land Registration Office for conducting inaccurate investigations, arbitrarily estimating prices, and disregarding public opinion. The matter may be submitted to the province for review.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Land and Grain Office Refutes Landowner Demands. Collecting Rent Along with Grain and Paying Taxes Collectively Are Not in Accordance with Laws and Regulations.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office on the 17th] The local Land Improvement Association previously formulated measures for collecting rent along with grain and paying taxes collectively in order to protect the interests of landlords, and established a General Office for Rent Collection and a Grain Purchase Committee to be responsible for promoting these measures. These measures have been reviewed and approved by the County Provisional Council and are being submitted to the County Government for approval. Our Suzhou-based special correspondent believes that although these measures protect the interests of landlords, collecting rent along with grain will invisibly increase the burden on tenant farmers, and paying taxes collectively will invisibly harm government tax revenue, which will have a significant impact on the entire finances. Therefore, they visited the person in charge of the Land and Grain Office on the 17th to inquire about their opinions. According to the interview, although this year's land tax is levied in kind, land rent is still collected in accordance with the 25% rent reduction method to show the government's concern for tenant farmers. The Land Improvement Association's proposed measures for collecting rent along with grain and paying taxes collectively have been reviewed and found to be inconsistent with laws and regulations, and have been rejected and not approved.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office] The county's collection of land tax in kind has begun. The Provincial Order previously organized a Land and Grain Office, and the personnel for the subordinate branch offices were formally announced on the afternoon of the 15th as follows: (1) He Jianyan, Director of the Chengxiang Branch Office. (2) Dong Fei, Director of the Mu瀆 Branch Office. (3) Dong Chonghua, Director of the Hushuiguan Branch Office. (4) Song Zidong, Director of the Huangdai Branch Office. (5) Gui Wanli, Director of the Weiting Branch Office. (6) Chen Jingbo, Director of the Xiangcheng Branch Office. (7) Luo Zhiping, Director of the Chen涇 Branch Office. (8) Zhu Shufan, Director of the Heng涇 Branch Office. Each branch office will also have a deputy director, who will be appointed by the Provincial Order at a later date. The collection of kind work must be completed by December 15.</p>
<h3>Danyang Self-Defense Force Training</h3>
<p>A Small Number of Ignorant People Want to Evade; The County Government Orders Each Township to Explain in Detail</p>
<p>[Report from our Danyang office] The local urban area people's self-defense force has been notified by each township office to the conscripted young men to complete the enlistment procedures within a limited time and actively carry out training.

<h3>Zhejiang Transportation and Water Conservancy Conference Reviewed Proposals in Groups Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou office on the 17th] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference held a group review meeting today.

<h3>Eliminating an Evil in Punan, Notorious Bandit Lu Ajin is Arrested; He Once Served as an Enemy and Puppet Secret Agent, Poisoning the Local Community</h3>
<p>[Report from our Songjiang office] Lu Aji, who was rampant in Punan, Songjin, and Fengyi during the period of occupation, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the 鉴河 监狱 before the War of Resistance. When the war broke out and Songjiang was occupied, the 监狱 seized the opportunity to escape back to his hometown. With the help of his sister, Mei Gao, he obtained a machine gun and several rifles, gathered bandits, and initially used the name of the guerrilla force to extort money, kill people, and set fires. The local people suffered countless losses. Later, he was suppressed by the 62nd Division of the National Army and joined the 13th Division of the puppet army, serving as the company commander of the machine gun company. Under the guise of 清鄉, the local people suffered again, and there are still lingering fears. After the 13th Division of the puppet army was reorganized, he joined Zhang's puppet police station as a secret agent. He became sworn brothers with Liu Guoqiang, the head of the puppet police station, and 巡官 陆振山, and worshiped the Japanese officer Watanabe as his adoptive father. He specialized in arresting and killing patriotic people, and there were quite a few of them. Last fall, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the bandit knew that his crimes were unforgivable and fled without a trace. Recently, the bandit, seeing that there was no movement, secretly returned home a few days ago. Unexpectedly, his evil deeds were full, and the Punan Tinglin Police Station learned of this and secretly sent squad leader Qiu and several others to capture the bandit at his home. A quick pistol and dozens of bullets were found on the bandit's body on the spot. The Tinglin Police Station prepared a document to transfer him to Songjiang and handed him over to the county government for interrogation. It has been found that the bandit accumulated a lot of wealth during the eight years of occupation and acquired more than a thousand acres of fertile land.</p>
<h3>A Rich Merchant's Estate, Women File Lawsuits</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office] The late silk and cloth merchant Yao Junyu, during his lifetime, founded silk and cloth shops such as Qian Taixiang, Da Youheng, Xie Daixiang, and Xie Ji, and was a famous rich merchant in Suzhou. He had three sons and five daughters: the eldest son, Xuanyu; the second son, Jing 荣; the youngest son, Shuwei; daughters 绣梅 (married to Wu), 艳梅 (married to 荣), Mingmei, Qinmei, and 似英. Yao died of illness before the war and did not leave a will. In addition to the cloth shops, his estate also included Lifa Soap Factory, dozens of houses, Mobil Oil Company stocks, and farmland. During the period of occupation, the relatives discussed the analysis of the estate, but the result was abandoned due to the opposition of Xuanyu and others. After the victory last year, Qinmei requested an analysis of the estate because her marriage was approaching, but was again blocked by her brothers and sisters. Therefore, in June of this year, she filed a petition with the local court requesting that inheritance be ordered in accordance with the law. After repeated unsuccessful mediation by the Civil Court, the first hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. on the 19th of this month. In addition to issuing summons to the plaintiff Yao Yanmei, the defendant Yao Xuanyu and his wife, and eight sisters, Yao's chief accountant Ma Yonghe, and the managers of the four major cloth shops, 史毓生, Shi Zisheng, Zhang Meisheng, and Wang Weibo, have also been summoned to testify in court.</p>

<p>An Oil Depot is Out of Control, Causing Heavy Losses</p>
<p>[Report from our Chongming office] The Tongchangxiang Kerosene Company in Baozhen, Chongming Third District, has a strong capital base and a prosperous business.

<h3>Changshu Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Documents, Bao'enfang Stele, Disappeared During the War and Have Only Recently Been Discovered</h3>
<p>[Report from our Changshu office] The only remaining Taiping Heavenly Kingdom document in this area, the "Bao'enfang Stele," has recently been rediscovered in the ruins of the county party headquarters. As early as the twelfth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the people of Yi built a Heavenly Dynasty archway outside the South Gate to commemorate Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng. Today, the street name there is still called Heavenly Dynasty Archway, and the archway was named Bao'enfang. A stone stele was erected next to the archway, with the preface to the Bao'enfang Stele engraved on it. In the Qing Dynasty, the relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were almost completely destroyed. Only this stele was hidden by nearby houses and was not destroyed. In the early years of the Xuantong period, it was moved to the Rice Industry Primary School, and twenty-five years later, it was moved to the County Party Department. During the war, the buildings of the County Party Department were destroyed. Recently, the county government reorganized the ruins into a sports field, and it was discovered again.</p>
<h3>Xicheng District's Suppression Campaign is in Full Swing; Surrendered Bandits Are Willing to Enlist Remaining Gang Members; Counties in the Border Area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Encircle and Suppress on Three Routes</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi office] Xu Yuanruo, the commander of the Wuxi sub-district of the Xicheng Joint Defense Zone, stated that Dongting, Anzhen, and Dangkou districts in eastern Wuxi have always been bandits' dens. Now that the suppression campaign is in full swing, in order to eradicate the source of bandits and appease the local area, he specially set out on the 15th with Chief Tang of the Civil Affairs Section of the County Government and his entourage to inspect the Xicang area, and summoned the former Civil Affairs Section Chief of the puppet Xidong County Government, Zeng Junfeng, who had already surrendered, to listen to a report on the bandit's work experience. Commander Xu greatly comforted him for Zeng Bandit's frank attitude and sincere words, and immediately appointed him as the Commissioner for Appeasement of Wuxi County to carry out appeasement work in order to achieve the mission of appeasement. There is also the female bandit Huang Suying, who has also been arrested. The female bandit directly admitted her guilt and expressed her willingness to accept appeasement and repent. However, the bandit leader Chen Xueliang is still at large.</p>
<p>[Report from our Wuxing office] Lu Shiyang, the commander of the suppression campaign in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in order to understand the situation of the bandits in various places so as to carry out the suppression, recently led staff members to Yixing, Guangde, Liyang, and other counties to inspect the bandit situation. He immediately returned to his garrison and formulated a suppression plan, ordering the relevant authorities in each county to jointly suppress the bandits, departing in three routes: one route to Changxing, the second route to Guangde, and the third route to Yixing. The suppression was quite effective. There are still bandit units such as Xu Daozhen and Zhang Zhiyi fleeing to Taihu Lake.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Illegal Money Houses in Liuhe</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Liuhe dispatch] In the local area, only Yizhong, Huiyu, and Yu Kang operate as money houses. Illegal operations have been ongoing for several months. Recently, a complaint was filed, and the Ministry of Finance dispatched Tang Jielan, the section chief of the Inspection Section of the Business Department of the Central Bank, to conduct a secret investigation in Liuhe a few days ago.

It is reported that Tang did not express any opinion at the time and has now returned to report.</p>
<h3>Taixing Provisional Assembly Accuses Former County Magistrate of Falsely Reporting Losses and Embezzling Requisitioned Property</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Taixing dispatch] The Taixing county seat was breached by the Communist army, and shops and residences were looted. The losses suffered by government agencies were enormous. The provincial government, in order to investigate the disaster situation and local losses, dispatched personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and requested all agencies to submit reports. However, the former county magistrate, Xu Peiqi, reported losses of over 27 million yuan from the treasury. Later, local residents learned of this and were quite surprised. The county government was in arrears with various agencies and unable to meet its financial obligations. It had to borrow from local merchants to pay expenses. If the treasury had such a large sum, why borrow from merchants? The county provisional assembly sent a letter to the former county magistrate, requesting him to attend a public announcement. However, upon receiving the request, he dispatched Tang Mingxu, the chief of the Second Section, to represent him, claiming he would soon be relieved of his post. Tang's report on the losses was preposterous and the items did not match, further arousing suspicion. Local residents are now paying close attention to the falsified funds. The provisional assembly has filed a complaint with the inspector, the Judicial Yuan, and the administrative agencies, listing his crimes and embezzlement of requisitioned materials, such as over 1,000 dan (担, a unit of weight) of opium, hundreds of dan of wheat and rice, over 50 boxes of pig fat, over 400 newspapers from Hengqingchang and other stores, and hundreds of boxes of foreign goods and matches.</p>

<h3>Suzhou's Commerce Declines; Reputation as "Paradise" Difficult to Maintain; Wang Xiaolai Discusses Impressions in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou 17th dispatch] Wang Xiaolai, the director of the National Federation of Commerce Preparatory Committee, and Fang Zhichao, the director of the Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu's office, arrived in Suzhou together around 10:00 AM on the 17th to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Suzhou Association. Wang and Fang delivered speeches, offering words of encouragement. After the meeting, this reporter interviewed Wang, who shared his impressions of Suzhou. He felt the general situation was good, but was deeply concerned about the decline of Suzhou's commerce after the war, which was vastly different from before the war. The crisis was pervasive, and if this continued, the commercial economy would soon collapse. The former reputation as a "paradise" could not be sustained. He stated that after the National Federation of Commerce is established, he will make suggestions and quickly seek relief measures. He also hopes that the relevant local authorities will quickly formulate concrete plans to rescue the situation. Wang also stated that the National Federation of Commerce has decided to be established in Nanjing on November 11th, and representatives from various regions are required to report to Nanjing by the 5th. Although the hidden crisis in industry and commerce is present everywhere, it is even more severe in Shanghai. A special economic committee has been established to coordinate rescue measures and is actively planning. In the afternoon, Wang inspected the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway and had the intention of raising funds to build the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway to facilitate cargo transportation. He then toured famous scenic spots. That evening, he attended a banquet hosted by business leaders in the county and took the night express train to Nanjing to preside over the affairs of the National Federation of Commerce.</p>

<p>My Views on Repaying Long-Term Savings</p>
<p>Reading reports from various places about lawsuits concerning pre-war bank long-term deposits, which resulted in court judgments ordering banks to compensate depositors at a rate of one thousand times the original amount, I cannot help but feel moved. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, prices have skyrocketed, often several times a month, resulting in prices being thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times higher than before the war. As a result, salaried civil servants are struggling to survive. In light of this, the government has issued clear orders to increase salaries to a reasonable level. Since the victory, the price index has continued to rise daily, leading to adjustments every three months, as has been publicly announced. Furthermore, gold and foreign exchange, which are subject to government control, have continued to increase. As President Ju stated in response to inquiries from reporters in the capital, "Based on the price index, one thousand times is not an exaggeration. The value of rice, cloth, and other items has increased five thousand times, or even ten thousand times, compared to before the war." He continued, "This matter is of great importance and involves many issues. If it is not resolved, there will be many disputes when pre-war debts are repaid and long-term savings are withdrawn upon maturity. I have discussed this matter with Minister of Finance Yu, and we are currently discussing solutions."</p>
<p>President Ju is a legal authority, and his remarks are fair and accurate. I believe that the court's judgment of repaying pre-war deposits at a rate of one thousand times is a great loss to depositors. If depositors had not adhered to savings regulations and withdrawn their deposits to invest in other assets, the value would undoubtedly be four to five thousand times higher, if not tens of thousands of times higher. If banks repay pre-war savings at a rate of one thousand times, taking five thousand times as a minimum, would depositors not suffer a loss of more than four-fifths? Banks are the hub of finance, and bank staff are economic professionals. They cannot claim ignorance of the impact of deposits on depositors. Since they are aware of this, human conscience cannot be extinguished! As Mr. Zizhu said, "Two thousand yuan could buy a house before the war, but now it is not enough to buy four sheng (升, a unit of dry measure) of rice." I know that the officials in charge will not do this, nor will they bear to do it! The number of long-term savings depositors is not very large. Wealthy families do not make long-term deposits. Long-term depositors must be law-abiding citizens without speculative or get-rich-quick fantasies. They may be saving for their children's education, marriage, or for their own old age. It is not easy to raise funds at once, so they plan ahead, accumulating little by little over ten or twenty years. Therefore, pre-war long-term savings should be repaid to depositors at a rate of at least five thousand times to be fair. Even if banks suffer significant losses as a result, the government should openly withdraw enemy and puppet assets to compensate the banks. The devaluation of currency is due to enemy aggression. If the enemy had not launched an invasion, China's monetary system would be stable, and there would be no distinction between pre-war and post-war. Using enemy and puppet assets to compensate depositors for their losses is justified in principle. It is simply a matter of the banks handling the transfer of funds. Furthermore, regarding education expenses, the state provides public funding for poor students, and the cultivation of one student requires considerable state funds. Now, there are people who, with the ambition of self-reliance, make long-term savings to pay for their children's education expenses. I know that the government should commend them, not allow depositors to lose their support. Banks cannot be allowed to use unilateral reasons (assuming that commercial banks deposit 20% of their funds in the national treasury and cannot use them) to commit unconscionable acts. The people of China are sympathetic and speak out against injustice. I will speak out on behalf of all small depositors, sympathizing with the court's principle of repaying pre-war long-term savings at a rate of one thousand times, and advocating that the repayment amount should be at least five thousand times or seven thousand times. I also agree that the Chief Justice and the Minister of Finance should discuss solutions and issue a clear announcement as soon as possible to quell public anger. I look forward to this with great anticipation. (Zhou Zilu)</p>

<h3>Investigation into Göring's Suicide Completed, to Be Announced Today; Bodies of Eleven War Criminals Cremated and Secretly Buried</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch] London, 17th (broadcast from Nuremberg): The investigation into the truth of Göring's suicide has been completed, and the results will be announced today.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 17th (emergency broadcast from Nuremberg): The bodies of the ten Nazi war criminals and Göring, who were hanged in Nuremberg Prison, have been cremated, and their ashes have been secretly scattered in various locations.</p>
<h3>Speculation on Source of Poison</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 17th] After Göring's suicide in prison, the authorities may summon many people to investigate how he obtained the poison. Göring's wife may also be summoned. She said goodbye to her husband in prison on October 7th. When she left the prison, her face was stern, but there were no tears in her eyes. Others who will be summoned include Göring's lawyer, Dr. Stahmer, Dr. Frucher, a German doctor who examined Göring under the supervision of an American doctor, and 27 German prison staff. These Germans had been thoroughly searched before entering the prison and had never left after entering. The poison Göring took must have been obtained recently, because if it had been hidden for a long time, the effect would not have been so rapid. Speculation abounds. Some say that Göring's wife may have given him the vial of poison when they kissed goodbye, or that the German barber may have secretly tucked the vial into his collar when he was giving Göring a haircut. However, according to prison authorities, no one has been arrested in connection with this case so far.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 16th] Major Teich, an officer in the Nuremberg Court Security Department, said, "As far as I know, it is impossible that Göring received the poison from his wife. The last time Göring's wife met her husband was ten days ago. At that time, the two stood behind a thick sheet of glass, and Göring was also handcuffed. The two did not kiss. I believe Göring secretly hid the poison when he was arrested."</p>
<h3>Early Signs of Suicidal Thoughts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 17th] According to an official at the Nuremberg Court, Göring made remarks related to suicide nine days before taking the poison. When asked to sign a document, Göring took off the paper clip and said, "It is best to take this back, lest the guard think I plan to use it to hang myself." Judging from other incidents, it can be proven that Göring's intention to commit suicide was decided when he heard the verdict of hanging, and he may have discussed the matter of taking poison with Ribbentrop during the trial. Since the sentencing, Göring's conversations with prison guards and his behavior have unconsciously revealed a certain idea in his mind. Dr. Gilbert, a prison psychologist, said that Göring was most unhappy about the rope after hearing the verdict, and later asked his defense lawyer to apply for a change to execution by firing squad. Then there was the humorous incident with the paper clip. Göring also revealed his fear of hanging during a conversation with Dr. Keller, the chief psychiatrist of the Nuremberg Tribunal. At the same time, the authorities ordered an officer of the U.S. Third Army, in a capacity unrelated to the case, to conduct an investigation into the Göring poison case. His report is expected to be submitted to the four-nation commission within two days.</p>
<h3>U.S. Prosecutor Advocates Continuing to Try German War Criminals</h3>

The United States should immediately begin trying the unrepentant Nazi Party members, industrialists, soldiers, politicians, diplomats, and police in its occupied areas. According to Jackson, their crimes are no different from those of other war criminals who have already been sentenced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The Allied military authorities announced today that the seven Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment by the International Military Tribunal, namely Hess, Funk, Raeder, Schirach, Speer, Neurath, and Dönitz, will be imprisoned in Spandau Prison in the British-occupied sector of Berlin, because it is small and easy to defend. After the prisoners enter the prison, they will be guarded by an international guard. It will take about a month to prepare, but the date of their transfer from Nuremberg to Spandau Prison has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>French Popular Republican Movement Resolves to Separate from Socialist and Communist Parties</h3>

<h3>Southern Tribes Reach Compromise with Government; Internal Strife in Iran Ends; Bevin Guarantees Non-Interference in Iranian Internal Affairs, Expresses Strong Desire to Establish Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 17th] According to the official gazette published here today, the rebellion of the southern Iranian tribes against the Iranian government, which has lasted for several months, has agreed to stop, and the Iranian government has promised the tribes more representation in the Fars provincial government. Iranian Army General Chahidi said that the rebellion was a "national movement to fight for the rights of the people." Both sides have agreed to increase the number of Fars provincial representatives in the parliament, extend the railway line to Fars province, pardon the rebel people, and select provincial government officials from the residents of Fars province.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in the House of Commons, stated that recent events in Iran have affected British-Iranian relations. He said, "The British government solemnly declares without hesitation that the rumors that British officials in Iran secretly participated in a conspiracy against the Iranian government are completely unfounded. The British government is very willing to establish good relations with the Iranian government and is constantly improving them. Britain wants to see Iran prosperous, strong, independent, and free from foreign interference." Soviet newspapers and Iranian broadcasts have repeatedly publicized unfounded rumors about British officials. The British government will try to inform the Iranian people of the truth. Bevin added that recent unrest in southern Iran and the arrest of tribal leaders led the Iranian government, based on certain intelligence, to hastily claim that the British Consul in Ahvaz, Trolod, was complicit in the tribal rebellion. The British government, after investigation, proved that Trolod was innocent and informed the Iranian government, which accepted the British assurances. Therefore, this incident should be considered closed. The British government hereby declares that British diplomats and consuls in Iran have been ordered not to interfere in the country's internal affairs. The British government is very satisfied that British officials in Iran have not violated this directive.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Suddenly Stops Economic Aid to Czechoslovakia</h3>

Goods worth $10 million had already been shipped and were allowed to be delivered. (2) The Czechoslovak government's negotiations with the U.S. Export-Import Bank for a $50 million loan were indefinitely suspended.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Announces New Budget with Scientific Research Funding Increased to £200 Million; News and Truth Newspapers Publish Appreciative Comments</h3>
<p>[Moscow, United Press, 16th] The Soviet government announced its new budget today, in which funding for scientific research has been increased to approximately £200 million, while defense spending has been reduced to approximately £3.432 billion, calculated at pre-war exchange rates. Soviet newspapers have expressed praise for this. "News" published an editorial on its front page stating: "The development of scientific research funding has greatly increased, approximately 32.4 times that of last year. Stalin stated before the elections in February this year: 'We not only need to catch up with foreign scientific achievements in the shortest possible time, but also surpass them.' This statement has been put into practice. In the future, special attention should be paid to the large-scale construction of various scientific research institutes." "Truth" stated: "For the past five years, our country has survived on a military budget. All national resources and the full strength of the people have been directed towards a single goal: to defeat the hateful enemy. Huge amounts of materials have been controlled by the state and used for the front lines; the new budget reflects the new tasks of the new era.

<p>[Chincoteague, Virginia, United Press, 16th] Radar-guided glide bombs, hailed as the vanguard of future weapons, were exercised by the U.S. Navy near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina today. This was the first glide bomb launched to attack a fleet. The bomb, weighing 1,000 pounds, is attached to the belly of a "Bat." Launched from a fighter or patrol aircraft, the "Bat" glides in the air for more than ten miles in search of its target. The "Bat" is equipped with radar in its nose, enabling it to automatically search for enemy ship movements and correct errors caused by aiming and wind. This type of bomb was tested on Japanese ships a few months before the end of the Pacific War with considerable success. Currently, four-engine patrol bomber squadrons are learning to use it here.</p>
<h3>Muslims Demonstrate Against Nehru</h3>
<p>[North-West Frontier Province, India, United Press, 16th] Thousands of Muslims in the North-West Frontier Province, some armed with sticks, broke through police lines today and held a demonstration in front of the government building here, protesting against Nehru, the leader of the interim government. League members gathered outside the barbed wire fence of the North-West Frontier Province airport. As Nehru arrived at the airport by plane, the crowd shouted slogans such as "Nehru go home." Nehru returned to the government building via a side road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chieftains Repeatedly Delayed Promise to Attack Soviet Union from the East</h3>
<p>Soviet Presentation of German Documents</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 17th] The Soviet side presented evidence at the International Tribunal today stating that Japanese diplomats and military personnel had assured Germany that Japan would immediately respond in the East as soon as Hitler launched a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union in the West, despite the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty. However, they later failed to fulfill this promise. The Soviet prosecutor presented a secret telegram from former Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, dated July 5, 1941, at a time when Hitler's troops had already begun attacking the Soviet Union. The purpose of this telegram was clearly to exert pressure on the Japanese government to fulfill its promise to attack the Soviet Union from the East. Other evidence presented by the Soviet Union showed that the Japanese side repeatedly delayed, claiming that the Japanese army needed more time to prepare.</p>
<h3>Siam to Use Return of Territory as Principle for Negotiations with France</h3>
<p>[Bangkok, Central News Agency, 16th, United Press] Siamese Prime Minister Phraya Srivisaravaja announced today that the territories of Cambodia and Laos will be formally returned to French Indochina within a month. After the return of these territories, it is feared that the amount of rice that Siam has promised to provide to the Allied nations will be adjusted.</p>
<p>[Bangkok, Reuters, 16th] Siamese Foreign Minister Charoon, in an exclusive interview with a Reuters reporter, stated that the Siamese government has been authorized by the parliament to conduct Franco-Siamese negotiations based on the French proposal. Yesterday's resolution by the parliament does not mean that the government has fully accepted the French proposal, but only accepts the principle of returning the four provinces as a basis for seeking a final solution.</p>
<h3>British Youth, a Sadistic Killer of Young Women, Hanged</h3>
<p>[London, United Press, 16th] Heath, a demobilized air force pilot and former beauty, was hanged at Pentonville Prison today for sadistic killing of two young women, in a shocking case in British history. The perpetrator initially murdered actress Mrs. Gardner, whose naked body was found in his room at a London hotel on June 21 this year. Her feet were bound, her chest and back were whipped in seventeen places, she had teeth marks on her body, and she had been severely mutilated with instruments resembling fire pokers. Less than two weeks after this case occurred, he killed a beautiful young woman, Marshall, in a similar sadistic manner on a beach at Bournemouth. The woman's body was found in a grave near the coast, and she also had bite marks and whipping marks on her body.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Air Force Announces 3,000 Existing Flying Fortresses</h3>
<p>New Giant B-50 Aircraft Under Development</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 17th] The U.S. Army Air Force announced today that it currently has 3,040 B-29 Flying Fortresses ready for combat, a larger number than at the end of the war. In August of last year, the Army Air Force had 2,865 Flying Fortresses. The Air Force emphasized that this air power is not intended for war. According to the wartime contract of 1944, the last aircraft was delivered in June of this year, and there are currently no contracts in place. The Army Air Force's current plan is to focus on the larger B-35 and B-36 aircraft. In addition, it will manufacture the B-50 aircraft (an improved version of the B-29 aircraft), with a larger tail and engines, which can increase the flight range and speed.</p>
<h3>American Southern Many Missionaries (Part 1) A Sea of Farewells, All Waiting for Ships to Return to China</h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>[New York, Airmail, September 15] The South, the scenic American South, is not only the production area of cotton and tobacco, but also the hometown of missionaries. Walking on the streets of New York and Chicago, occasionally groups of three or five veterans will come up to you and say something like "Ding Hao" or "Good Weather" in Chinese. These people are considered Americans who have "drunk seawater," and they have a heroic pride revealed in northern society; but in the South, Americans who can speak, understand, and write Chinese are not a big deal. This group of people are missionaries. When I went to Tennessee to visit the TVA, I suddenly had a toothache on the train. As soon as I arrived in Knoxville, the first thing I did was visit an elderly dentist in his sixties. In the waiting room, I sat reading the newspaper. A kind old lady leaned over and gently asked me, "What is your surname?"</p>
<p>I was startled and shook her hand. She said that her name was "Mrs. Tu," and her husband was currently in China. Before the Chinese War of Resistance, both she and her husband were missionaries for the China Inland Mission in Changde, Hunan. She returned to the United States during the war and is now waiting for a ship to return to China. She said that she loved Changde more than her hometown in Tennessee, "but China lacks science and industry. So before leaving, I need to check my body. If my teeth are bad, I should have them extracted to avoid getting sick after returning to China." I asked her how to spell Mr. Tu's English name. She said very simply in Chinese, "Just call me Mrs. Tu. I like Chinese characters." She started demonstrating with a pencil in the waiting room, and many southern people with a "rural" flavor stretched their necks to look at her. In Knoxville, the most "qualified" missionaries besides Mrs. Tu were Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton. I met him at the only Chinese laundry in Knoxville. He saw my laundry ticket, reached out his hand, and said, "Are you Mr. Mao? It's an honor to meet you." He saw my name in the local newspaper. He wrote the three Chinese characters "Hai Mo-deng." In fact, his original English name was Hamilton, exactly the same name as the American statesman Hamilton whom the Father of the Nation mentioned in the Three Principles of the People when discussing the founding of America. When he was preaching in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, a Chinese friend gave him the name Hai Mo-deng. He said, "From then on, my surname is Hai, and my son's surname is also Hai." That night, Mr. Hamilton brought a very beautiful young lady to pick me up for a discussion at a relative's home. On the way, I asked him, "When are you returning to China?" He said he was leaving soon, "but the red bandits are very rampant near Xuzhou." His daughter then asked, "What are red bandits?" Hamilton patiently told her, "Bandits are robbers, and red in Chinese characters means the color red. Therefore, in Chinese, we don't call them the Communist Party, we call them red bandits." He added, "Because the Communist Party has no religion, no spiritual life, and no moral values, so we generally call them bandits." The educational spirit of this foreign pastor moved his daughter, and she nodded frequently. At that day's</p>
<p>family discussion, Hamilton introduced me to many old ladies and several retired pastors. Hamilton's wife and son were also present. Her Chinese was even better than her husband's. She asked me to write the characters for "cat" and "horse" for many devout old ladies to admire. At least, in the eyes of this group of old ladies, Mrs. Hamilton was the "hero" in their minds. Hamilton spoke a long farewell in English, thanking them for their farewells. He said, "This time I go to China, although Xuzhou, Jiangsu, is surrounded by the Communist Party, although my life is in danger, although China's economy is very difficult; but for the Lord, for Jesus Christ, I must go bravely." He also said, "A truly devout disciple of the Lord must have the faith to face life and death. This time I go to Xuzhou, maybe I won't come back, maybe I'll never see you again, but my heart is very calm, all for the Lord!" Everyone around was very quiet, and Miss Mary, who often had a smile on her face (Hamilton's daughter), also stared intently.</p>
<h3>Old Executioner Has Killed Over 200 People</h3>
<p>[Frankfurt, United Press, 17th] Ten Nazi war criminals have been hanged. The executioner was U.S. Sergeant Woods, who has hanged a total of 233 prisoners in four years. According to a U.S. soldier friend, Woods is not tall, but very sturdy, with brown hair and a receding hairline. As a result, 28 brutal Nazi party members from the Dachau concentration camp were hanged by Woods last summer.</p>

<h3>Grain Loan Case Offenders Transferred to District Attorney's Office Yesterday, Detained After Afternoon Interrogation, Wang Daren and Ren Xingya Were Calm During Transfer, Whole Case to be Expedited for Closure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan embezzlement case has been recently approved by Chairman 將 and transferred to the judicial authorities for trial. After receiving the order, the Garrison Headquarters transferred the six key offenders in the case, Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Wang Xunzhi, Wu Rong-sheng, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wang Meile, along with all case files and account books, who were detained in the headquarters' detention center, to the District Attorney's Office for handling yesterday morning.</p>
<p>At 9:40 am, Wang and the others were escorted onto a red-headed, black-bodied prison van, which also contained more than a dozen petty thieves and burglars. The Garrison Headquarters dispatched a platoon leader from the Special Service Company, Wang Huadong, leading eight soldiers fully armed for escort.</p>
<p>The prison van arrived at the entrance of the District Attorney's Office at 10:55 am. The petty thieves and burglars got off the van first, followed by the grain case offenders, with Wang Daren bringing up the rear. Wang was wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit, holding a briefcase, as fat as before, with a very good complexion. Ren Xingya was small and thin, wearing a gray suit, smiling with his teeth showing. Wang Xunzhi and the others were all wearing Chinese clothing, with indifferent expressions. After getting out of the van, Ren frequently nodded to people, with an extremely calm attitude. The offenders then walked into the hall, where personnel from the District Attorney's Office sequentially asked them their age, origin, and address, and then pressed their fingerprints before sending them to the detention center for detention.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Prosecutor Wu Qihua, who had just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, opened the court for investigation. It is reported that this case has been delayed for a long time and will be expedited.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Democratic National Committee of America, Farley, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Current Chairman of Coca-Cola Company, Purpose of Visit Mainly to Inspect Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] James Farley, the current Chairman of the Export Company of "Coca-Cola" of America, former Postmaster General of the United States, and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, arrived in Shanghai at 5 pm yesterday, transferring from America to Calcutta, via Kunming on a China National Aviation Corporation plane.

<p>Farley's stay in Shanghai and plans will be decided based on circumstances. He told reporters that if time permits, he may host a press conference. The main task of this visit is to inspect the company's business. Although he has now abandoned politics for business, he is still very active on the American political stage, so this trip may involve political relations. After a brief stay in Shanghai, he will go to Tokyo to inspect the company's business. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to Nanjing. Farley holds a very high position in American political circles. President Roosevelt relied heavily on his efforts during his four election campaigns.

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Train Derails in Jiashan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 6:35 am yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's down-bound 92nd train, with first, second and third class cars, totaling eleven carriages, was traveling from Jiaxing to Shanghai. Less than twenty minutes after departing, as it was entering Jiashan Station, the middle seven carriages suddenly derailed and tilted. Fortunately, no one was injured. After the accident, Jiashan Station urgently telegraphed the Shanghai North Station General Bureau to report, and Deputy Director Hou led Zhou Section Chief of the Transportation Section and Ge Section Chief of the Engineering Section, among others, by rescue train to the accident site to investigate and provide rescue. By noon, all the vehicles had been lifted and traffic was restored. Deputy Director Hou and the others also returned to Shanghai that night. It is said that the derailment was caused by uneven roadbed at the turnout. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line was delayed by three to four hours for all trains yesterday as a result, but the through joint transport train from Beijing to Hangzhou was only delayed by more than ten minutes.</p>
<h3>Wu Yifang on the New Woman</h3>
<p>"An exemplary woman should be the center of the family, a good citizen, and a success in her career."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special] Female educator Dr. Wu Yifang, President of Ginling College, specially rushed to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to give a lecture at the invitation of the American Women's Association of this city.</p>
<p>Dr. Wu wore a purplish-brown long-sleeved cheongsam, black leather shoes, and her hair was braided in a bun behind her head. She looked energetic, and no one would believe that she was over fifty years old.</p>
<p>At 4 pm yesterday, Dr. Wu raised the following question to dozens of American women at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. She said: People often say, "Studying is a waste for women. Once they get married, everything is over." How can we correct this erroneous view? — Only by using women's own power to fight for a legal status.</p>
<p>What is the status of women in the new China? Dr. Wu divided it into three aspects: (1) Status in the family — Historical examples tell people that women and family seem to be inseparable forever, so people generally say, "In the end, you always get married, why study?" In fact, even in the family, the status of women is still very important. There is an old Chinese saying: "See what a child will be at three, see what they will be at nine." It can be seen how important education is in childhood. A woman who has received higher education must be the center of the family, providing her children with an excellent environment. It is not enough to simply beautify children's clothing; it is necessary to cultivate one's children into sound citizens, healthy, resilient, with nationalistic ideas and a national outlook. (2) Status in society — In addition to being the center of the family, the new woman should broaden her horizons and become a member of society. China will soon implement constitutional government, and one should also take a strong interest in and actively participate in the election of National Assembly representatives. (3) Career — How to choose a career for women? Dr. Wu said: "Don't choose a career that is showy, easy, or profitable. The secret to success in a career lies in interest. Choose a career that suits your interests, so that you can do it with all your heart and soul. Generally speaking, social services, education, medical services, and law are more suitable for women, because women are careful, cautious, and have compassion. And past facts tell us that men and women are completely equal in intelligence. As long as we are willing to work hard, we are not afraid of not succeeding."</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Wu said excitedly: "This is the time, women should work hard. In the process of rebuilding China, the power of women is indispensable. We must enrich ourselves and prepare to exert our strength! Marriage should no longer be the end of a woman's career, but a beginning. We must continue to move forward. An exemplary woman should be the center of the family, a good citizen, and also a success in her career!"</p>
<p>Dr. Wu's lecture ended in applause. The Chinese and foreign guests who attended the meeting rushed to shake hands and greet her. In the midst of the chaos, the reporter frequently asked about the recent situation of Ginling Women's University, and learned that Ginling College has been steadily holding classes. Because the school's equipment suffered the ravages of war, it is still simple and crude after the resumption of the school. Therefore, it feels inconvenient everywhere. But the spirit of the teachers and students is commendable. They wash their faces with cold water and sleep on hard floors, but no one complains! After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Dr. Wu's first thing was to go to the China Travel Service to inquire whether the scientific instruments ordered from the United States had arrived. Dr. Wu was very happy to tell the reporter that "The instruments have all arrived, they arrived two months ago, and they can be transported to Nanjing immediately, so the students can use them." Her enthusiasm for running the school seriously aroused my infinite respect! The students of Ginling College are happy. Because they have such an excellent president!</p>
<h3>The Two Roads Corruption Case: After Six Hours of Trial and Debate, Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 24th; Accused Confront Each Other, Revealing Ugly Behavior; Merchants All Confess to Borrowing Money; Yu Xiangyan Demands Changes to Recorded Testimony, Leading to Arguments</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The major corruption case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, after its preliminary hearing on the 20th of last month, was originally scheduled for a second hearing on the 1st of this month. However, due to the presiding judge, Mei Erhe, falling ill, it was postponed until yesterday for the opening of the debate. All thirty-six accused, including detained Railway Administration employees and implicated managers and assistant managers of various commercial firms, as well as Ding Shuhui, former Deputy Director of the Materials Department, and Lu Runbao, wife of Zhang Bokang, appeared in court. Twenty-two defense lawyers for the accused and more than thirty reporters from various newspapers were present, causing the public gallery to be overcrowded. The trial began at 9:25 AM and concluded at 3:50 PM. After the accused confronted each other and the defense lawyers of each defendant presented their arguments in turn, the presiding judge announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentencing for the morning of the 24th of this month. Unexpectedly, as Judge Mei finished speaking, Yu Zongluo, the defense lawyer for Yu Zhonglu, manager of Shengchang Hardware Store, suddenly stood up from the left side of the defendant's lawyers' seats and shouted, "The right to the final debate in this case belongs to the prosecutor!" The entire court was shocked. According to Article 283 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the right to the final debate in a criminal case should belong to the defendant. Although Judge Mei explained in court that the prosecutor's statement was supplementary and not a debate, more than twenty defense lawyers still argued amongst themselves. At this time, Yu Xiangyan also demanded to correct the testimony record, leading to an argument with the recorder. Simultaneously, family members of another defendant also took the opportunity to demand bail for their relative, crying and causing a commotion, making it almost impossible to maintain order in the court. The six-hour "fatigue trial" concluded in this chaos.</p>
<h3>A Dense Mass of Heads in the Defendant's Dock</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the debate, the lawyers arrived in court unusually early. At 9:25 AM, the bailiff shouted, "Court is now in session," and Judge Mei Erhe and the prosecutor filed out, followed by the court clerk. Subsequently, the defendants Zhang Hongtu, Yu Xiangyan, Jing Weijun, Wang Renmao, Chen Jingyao, Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, Xia Dingwu, Sun Xuesan, Xu Chuangui, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, Li Jie, and merchants Yu Zhonglu, Shi Qingxiang, Li Fenbin, Jin Yunting, Li Binfen, Wang Yunxian, Wu Lianqing, Shi Yaoting, Yang Wenli, Shen Liansheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, Yu Yifu, Li Xingxin, Shen Huixiang, Xin Dingfu, and thirty-six others, were brought to court by the bailiffs and stood in three rows in the defendant's dock. After Judge Mei called out each name one by one, he first questioned Shi Qingxiang, a hardware merchant who had not been present at the preliminary hearing, and then confronted Jing Weijun, a Railway Administration employee who handled the receipt of commissions. Jing Weijun suddenly denied receiving money and giving gifts, while the managers of various commercial firms confessed to borrowing money, creating contradictions in their testimonies.</p>
<h3>Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu Confront Each Other in Court</h3>
<p>Then, Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu were brought in for confrontation. Zhang Bokang testified: "Before December 20th of last year, one morning, I went to Director Zhang's house and delivered one million yuan of bribes, including 400,000 yuan in cash and 600,000 yuan in checks. Zhang Hongtu did not want the checks and kept the cash." Zhang Hongtu said, "Last December, when the Railway Administration first took over, the work was busy, so I went to the office every morning, regardless of holidays or weekends. Zhang Bokang's claim that he came to my house to see me in the morning is inaccurate, which shows that it is fabricated." He also presented four rebuttals: (1) Zhang Bokang was introduced to the Railway Administration by me. If there was collusion and corruption, I could have taken advantage of it. Why would I repeatedly request to replace him? (2) Yu Xiangyan is not a Railway Administration employee and cannot advise on Materials Department affairs, let alone distribute commissions. (3) I never authorized the receipt of commissions when purchasing materials. This can be investigated. (4) According to everyone's testimony, I was in Hangzhou and had not returned when the commission distribution method was determined, so I could not have participated.</p>
<h3>Two Wives Face Off</h3>
<p>Lu Jian, Zhang Bokang's wife, and Yu Xiangyan were brought in for confrontation. Lu Jian denied that her husband's defense lawyer, Wang Xiaowen, was hired by Chen Bozhuang, and that Chen Bozhuang was willing to bear the future education expenses of Zhang Bokang's children. Yu Xiangyan insisted on his claim. Another witness, Deputy Director Ding Houfu, stated that although he was the Deputy Director, the Director had all the power, and he knew nothing.</p>
<p>The debate began at around 11:00 AM. Prosecutor Quan explained regarding Yu Xiangyan that Yu had evaded arrest after the case was exposed and could not be considered as voluntarily surrendering. He stated that the confessions of various accused regarding the acceptance of commissions and other criminal acts were all instructed by Yu. Yu's defense lawyer, Zhu Kuangming, argued that the prosecutor had no concrete evidence of Yu Xiangyan's corruption and that it was not sufficient to establish a case. He also stated that the confessions of the accused could not prove that the defendant had committed any actual criminal acts. Zhang Bokang's defense lawyer, Yu Chengxiu, also argued that the defendant was indeed an "honest man," as the Railway Administration's official letter to the District Procuratorate stated that Zhang Bokang was loyal and honest, and that Zhang Bokang had indeed contributed to the exposure of the case and the understanding of the truth. Subsequently, the lawyers present in court completed their arguments one after another.</p>
<h3>After Six Hours of Trial, the Conclusion of the Debate is Announced</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Quan Gang stood up to supplement, dividing his arguments into two aspects: facts and law. In terms of facts, all merchants had admitted to Jing Weijun borrowing money, with one firm reaching over seven million, which shows that such a large amount was not an ordinary gift. He also stated that the prosecution had used very few confessions from the accused while they were in the Railway Administration, but had used more self-confessions, because self-confessions are more reliable. As for the legal aspect, the use of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption was very much in line with the spirit of the legislation, and merchants should bear legal responsibility and cannot be measured by past customs. At this point, the court announced the conclusion of the trial, which aroused dissatisfaction among the defense lawyers. At this time, judges and lawyers, after more than six hours of continuous debate and questioning, were exhausted, and the defendants could no longer stand. The trial ended there.</p>
<h3>A New Means of Transportation: Three-Wheeled Automobiles Will Appear in Shanghai; Passengers Can Hire Them Along the Way</h3>
<p>It is reported that several rickshaw companies and three-wheeled vehicle manufacturing companies in this city, anticipating the possibility of being banned by the authorities, have changed their approach and ordered a large number of three-wheeled automobiles from abroad to Shanghai to organize a three-wheeled automobile rental company for business. It is said that the original price of these three-wheeled automobiles is about 400 US dollars per vehicle, plus tariffs and freight, totaling about 430 US dollars, equivalent to more than 1.5 million legal currency. These vehicles can travel 75 miles per gallon of gasoline and can carry three ordinary passengers. It is also reported that the capital of the three-wheeled automobile company, which is about to be established, will be approximately 300 to 500 million yuan. In the future, after its official establishment, the business method will be similar to renting three-wheeled vehicles. The daily rental fee will be determined by the numbers indicated on the newly installed "taximeter" on the vehicle, and there will be no branch stations like those of automobile rental companies. They will also park at designated parking areas in transportation hubs, just like operating three-wheeled vehicles. As for the price per passenger, it will also be determined by the distance traveled as shown on the "taximeter."</p>
<h3>A Parricide Case Causes a Sensation in Beixinjing; Neighbor Proclaims Old Father Kicked to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Ma Atao, a 56-year-old villager from Majiazhai Township in Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, had a son named Shunyu, 32 years old, who was disobedient and unfilial. He not only refused to listen to his father's teachings but also resorted to beating him, causing a breakdown in their father-son relationship. The day before yesterday, they argued again over a minor matter, and Shunyu punched his father repeatedly and kicked him violently. Ma was unable to resist and was kicked in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain and die shortly afterward. After the incident, Ma Shunyu hastily prepared a coffin for burial, attempting to conceal this monstrous crime, but as he was preparing for the burial, neighbors, spurred by a sense of justice, secretly reported it to the Beixinjing Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau immediately dispatched officers to the scene to stop the burial, arrested the unfilial son, and took him to the station for interrogation. At the same time, the body was sent by car to the morgue on Changde Road for examination, where it was found to have numerous injuries. This tragic case of parricide has already caused a sensation in the town. It is reported that the perpetrator confessed immediately after being arrested and was transferred to the District Procuratorate for legal action yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Bandit Hides Hand Grenades; Arrested Again as Soon as He Leaves Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] On April 25th of this year, military police, acting on a tip-off, went to room 204 of Jisheng Inn, No. 196 Fujian Road, and arrested five bandits, including Zhang Fugeng. After the police station investigated and confirmed the facts, they were transferred to the court for trial and were sentenced to imprisonment. After Zhang Fugeng was released from prison a few days ago, he suddenly went to Jisheng Inn yesterday morning, claiming that he had hidden something in the room and wanted to go inside to retrieve it. However, since there were lodgers in the room at the time, the tea server told him to come again in the afternoon. Zhang did return at the appointed time and secretly dug up the floor in the room, took out a hidden hand grenade, and intended to take it elsewhere. The tea server discovered it, fearing an accident, and secretly reported it to the police station, which arrested Zhang and the evidence and took them to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Land Administration and Health Committees of the City Council Held Their Second Meetings Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Hu Wenyuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and He Zhifu of the Xingye Trust Company were present.

It was decided to revise and pass it. In addition, a temporary motion was passed, requesting the municipal government to calculate all rents for housing leases in legal currency.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Health Committee of the City Council also held its second meeting at the City Council at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people, including Pang Jingzhou, attended. Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, and others were present. Chairman Pang Jingzhou reported the main points for discussion after the meeting, and then Director Zhang reported, saying: The Health Education Committee plans to set the school health fee. According to research results, primary schools can charge 2,000 yuan per person, middle schools can charge 3,000 yuan per person, and private schools can charge an additional 50%. Subsequently, the discussion of three temporary motions began. Finally, Pang Jingzhou suggested that it is important for the Health Bureau to kill mad dogs, but the prevention of smallpox is even more important. Starting vaccination next year may be too late, and it should be advanced to November this year to start vaccination to prevent problems. Director Zhang expressed his willingness to accept it, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Shortage of Electricity Generation Reaches a Serious Stage; Factories Take Turns Shutting Down</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Ledlow Aird, manager of the French-Chinese Water and Electricity Company in this city, announced yesterday that the shortage of electricity generation in the company has reached a serious stage, and with winter approaching, electricity consumption is bound to increase. Therefore, all factory users must stop using electricity between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM every day. The company also sent a letter to all residential users, urging them to save electricity as much as possible. Mr. Ledlow said that in the former French Concession area, electricity consumption has recently increased by more than 80% compared to before.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu invited the conveners of various committees of the City Council to dinner the day before yesterday to discuss the matter of saving electricity. The consensus was that the current electricity consumption of residents accounts for only a small portion of the city's total consumption, and electricity consumption has been reduced to the lowest level, so it should not be reduced further. Therefore, no decision was made at that time, and it will be discussed again at the Public Utilities Bureau meeting next week.</p>
<p>The Heaviest Burden at Twilight</p>
<p>Mr. Farrah, general manager of the Shanghai Power Company, also doubts whether this method of saving electricity by users will help the city's electricity situation. If the electricity consumption of each residential user is reduced by 20%, then the situation in the former French Concession and Zhabei can be improved because most of the users are residential. However, it will not help the Shanghai Power Company. The current lack of power generation is not due to a lack of fuel, but because the power company's power generation capacity cannot bear the burden at a certain time of day. The most difficult time for the Shanghai Power Company now is from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. In order not to exceed the company's maximum load, many factories have to shut down during this hour.</p>
<p>Reducing electricity consumption by 20% for residential users can only save 2.5% of the company's total electricity consumption. Moreover, if users are only asked to reduce electricity consumption, the time when users reduce consumption may be late at night, rather than the twilight when it is most necessary to save.</p>
<p>Factory Power Outage Times in Various Districts</p>
<p>Regarding factory electricity consumption, three methods are still used: rotational power outages, daily power outages, and emergency power outages. In the Shanghai Power Company area, the yarn mills are divided into six groups, with daily power outages. Two groups are from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, two groups are from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and two groups are from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. At the same time, each group takes turns having a full-day power outage within six days, from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Small factories have been divided into six groups for rotational power outages since the day before yesterday. Factories in the Zhabei area have adopted two types of power outages: rotational power outages and emergency power outages. In the Huashang Pudong Er Company area, all factories will have a power outage from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM every day.</p>
<h3>The Joint Celebration of New and Old Directors of the Shanghai North Second District Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>In the Zhabei District of this city, as early as the late Qing Dynasty, local gentry organized the Shanghai Commercial Fire Brigade. After repeated wars, the only surviving fire brigade in North Shanghai was the Second Volunteer Fire Brigade of the North Shanghai District. Fortunately, the association was still there, but it was full of holes and the losses were untrue. In June of this year, after the association worked hard, and under very difficult material conditions, it managed to recover. At 6 PM the day before yesterday, a joint celebration of new and old directors was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. More than 50 people attended, including Xi Yushu, Zheng Ziliang, Ye Binyong (representative of the Fire Department of the Municipal Police Bureau), etc. Chen Weihan, executive director of the North Shanghai Fire Brigade United Association, attended the meeting as the temporary chairman and immediately invited Pan Gongzhan to be the honorary chairman, Xi Wangshu and Yin Tiyang to be the chairman and vice chairman, Zhao Junhao to be the executive director, Chen Zhengrui and Yang Qingpan to be supervisors, Qu Shichang and Zhang Nanbao to be economic directors, Zhou Dongming, Huang Jiping and Rao Siyan to be social directors, Xu Shaotang to be the director of the association, and Ni Runsen to be the deputy director.</p>
<h3>Deeply Afraid of Causing Trouble, But Trouble Still Occurs; Legs Broken Under Police Car</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In front of the Asia Company at the intersection of Zhongshan East 1st Road and Zhongzheng Road, at about 5:00 PM yesterday, a tram of a certain French company was parked there. Subsequently, a US Army jeep, number 41533, also blocked it from behind. At the same time, a British Company tram, number 737, was traveling north from the south and approached the jeep. At that time, traffic police officer Zhang Zhengmin (31 years old, from Anhui), number 1763, saw the situation and was deeply afraid of causing trouble, so he hurried up to watch. Unexpectedly, he was knocked to the ground by the British Company tram number 737, which did not brake in time, breaking both legs. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, the doctor said that the policeman's legs had to be amputated and he would become disabled.</p>

<h3>Study the Establishment of a "Municipal Court" to Resolve Housing Lease Disputes; Prevent Unscrupulous People from Manipulating and Profiteering; Those Who Forcibly Occupy Houses Will Have Nowhere to Hide</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the municipal government is currently studying the establishment of a "Municipal Court" specializing in handling housing lease disputes in order to completely eliminate the practice of demanding key money and raising rents when leasing houses. He also hired Mr. Hoyer Millick, former Chief Justice of the US Court in China, as a legal advisor. Hoyer Millick is currently a legal advisor to Mobil Oil Company, and he stayed in China for a long time before the war and is very familiar with the situation in Shanghai and Chinese law.</p>
<p>The court will formulate various clear regulations to prevent unscrupulous people from manipulating and profiteering by renting. After the court is established, all rental disputes can be effectively resolved. According to municipal government regulations, for all pre-war old tenants whose houses were occupied by the enemy and who still live in them after the war, their original lease is still valid.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said that the housing problem in this city is indeed very difficult, and it will still take some time to resolve it. The biggest problem a month ago was the houses left behind after the withdrawal of enemy aliens. Before the establishment of the Housing Allocation Committee, many people were illegally forcibly occupying them. After the establishment of the Municipal Court, the ruling can be enforced and evacuated within one month.</p>

<h3>Measures to Eliminate Funeral Homes and Limit Coffin Storage, Requiring Separate Burial by Year's End</h3>
<p>After the war, our city was once nearly an isolated island. The coffins of deceased citizens were transported out of the city, leading to significant operational challenges. Businessmen seized the opportunity to establish funeral homes, often hastily constructing buildings on rented land, which had a significant impact on hygiene. The Health Bureau has drafted six measures to address this: (1) Immediately announce a deadline for all coffins to be separately buried or transported to their ancestral homes by the end of the year; (2) Each funeral home should promptly notify the families of the deceased to comply with the deadline; (3) During the clearance period, the deceased should be buried within one month of encoffining; (4) The Health Bureau will send personnel to investigate the number of coffins stored in each funeral home, accurately determine the quantity, and mark them as substandard or unclaimed to prioritize cremation; (5) Each funeral home should report the number of coffins relocated for burial or transported back to their ancestral homes to the Health Bureau every ten days; (6) In addition to the existing Hami Road crematorium, the Health Bureau will temporarily designate additional cremation sites in consultation with the Land Administration Bureau.</p>

<h3>Hidaka Tomiaki Testifies in Court Yesterday, Exposing German-Japanese Conspiracy Against the Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Cooperation between the two countries continued until Japan's surrender</p>
<p>The trial of twenty-seven Nazi war criminals continued yesterday in the U.S. military court. Lieutenant Colonel Hidaka Tomiaki, former head of the Japanese Intelligence Department in North China, testified, exposing the German-Japanese conspiracy against the Allied nations. After Germany's surrender, the Japanese military suffered successive defeats. They also had two major concerns: one was the fear that the U.S. military would transfer troops from the Western Front to the Pacific and the Philippines, posing a greater threat to the Japanese army; the other was anxiety about the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan, which would affect the Japanese army's operations in North China. Hidaka Tomiaki, who was in charge of intelligence work in North China, maintained close contact with various staff members of the Ohlert spy network. The main figures in North China intelligence were the Germans Kuhlsaat and Panla. After Germany's surrender, the Japanese were deeply worried. One evening, Hidaka Tomiaki met with Kuhlsaat, who believed that, based on the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union would likely maintain its consistent policy in the near future and would not join the Allied nations in fighting Japan. Moreover, the Soviet troops on the Western Front were currently being demobilized in large numbers, so the Far Eastern war situation was expected to remain largely unchanged. Kuhlsaat also told Hidaka Tomiaki that, according to the information they had obtained, the U.S. military's troop movements to the Pacific might end within two months, at which time they would pose a great threat to the Japanese army in the Pacific. The Japanese military at the time attached great importance to this intelligence, even studying the news from the Associated Press, United Press, and other news agencies in detail, believing that they might uncover behind-the-scenes political news. German-Japanese cooperation never ceased for a single day until Japan's surrender. This group, which used the consulate as a haven, ended its dream of attacking the Allied nations.</p>

<h3>A Lady is Raising Funds for a Nursery, But Lacks Suitable Housing</h3>
<p>Hoping Enthusiastic People will Help Sponsor this Righteous Cause</p>
<p>This recently received a letter from Ms. Wu Lude, stating that a friend of hers, Ms. , deeply felt the pain of working women who had no time to take care of their children during working hours, and planned to set up a nursery for the children of all working women. Now, the funds and all other procedures have been prepared, but a suitable house has not yet been found. Therefore, she entrusted this column to disclose the letter, hoping that enthusiastic people in the community will cooperate and assist in this righteous cause, so that it can be realized as soon as possible, which is also a great gospel for the women's community in Shanghai. The original letter is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>"Editor: Today, I am bringing excitement and hope to ask you to give me a chance to appeal to the enthusiastic people in the community. Now, there is a loving and respectable mother who, because she has experienced the pain of working women, feels that there is no reasonable time to take care of her children, and is willing to dedicate her energy and financial resources to set up a nursery for her sisters. For a year, I have seen her work hard to plan this matter. Now, the funds and other issues have been largely prepared with the help of enthusiastic friends, but the last housing problem has not yet been solved, which makes everyone very anxious!</p>
<p>I am a member of the working women. My sense of responsibility prompts me to help her make an appeal to the enthusiastic people in the community, in order to jointly complete this good deed, so that the sisters in this city can get the opportunity to entrust their children as soon as possible.

<h3>Promoting Gauze Control Mayor Wu Spoke Yesterday, Reports from All Industries Have Been Separately Submitted for Review and Audit is Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since Mayor Wu assumed the position of Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee a few days ago, he summoned senior officials of the Committee in the city government at around 10:00 AM yesterday. The Committee's Vice Chairman Li Shengbo, together with Business Director Liu Wenteng, Secretary Director Guan Demao, Deputy Director Gao Yuetian, Accounting Office Director Geng Ju, and all section chiefs, paid their respects. Chairman Wu immediately gave a speech, saying that he hoped everyone would work with peace of mind and maintain the status quo. He himself did not intend to bring anyone to the meeting to work, so he did not want any changes. In addition, he inquired about the handling of the application for gauze to be transported to the South. He then reiterated the three measures decided upon when he convened the relevant guilds of cotton spinning and cotton yarn secondary products on the 11th, namely: 1. Yarn factories should report the production equipment, production quantity, city goods quantity, and actual distribution situation of the previous month in a register. 2. Cotton secondary products industry should quickly report the production equipment, the actual yarn purchase situation of the previous month, and the future needs in a register. 3. Yarn number cotton cloth number should quickly report the sales volume of the previous month, the account name, and the legal profit amount that should be obtained in a register. He hoped to urge the relevant guilds to follow and report as soon as possible for these three points. All report data will be submitted to the Textile Management Committee for research, so as to determine the entire countermeasure. It is heard that Mayor Wu once stated that the distribution price of cotton yarn in the future will be determined as far as possible without rigid regulations. The determination of the new distribution price will not only consider its production cost and legal profit, but also add the profit that can develop the business.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee's handling of the registration of manufacturers transporting gauze to the South, after consultation with Mayor Wu, has now decided to close the registration at 5:00 PM on the 19th. Starting today, the Committee will send people to re-examine the registered manufacturers. As of yesterday, 498 transportation and sales companies and 230 production plants have requested application registration forms from the Committee.</p>
<p>The yarn business Zhouye Guild has completed the registration of members' existing yarn yesterday. A total of more than 270 members have registered, and the total inventory of 20-count yarn is 2,204 pieces and 18 small packages. It is said that from August 31 to October 12, the members of the guild have been distributed cotton yarn in the Joint Distribution Association, a total of 656 pieces for Fangjian Company and 8,398 pieces for private factories. There are also 200 members of the guild who have not filled in the registration form, mainly because of the lack of existing yarn. All the registered existing yarn numbers were sent to the city government yesterday afternoon. The Sixth District Machine Textile Guild also reported to the city government in accordance with the current regulations.</p>

<h3>Repaying Pre-War Deposits Only Increased Interest Rates Said</h3>
<p>After the city's banking sector was ordered by the court to pay pre-war deposits at a thousand times the original amount, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has made a decision on this issue. It is heard that all pre-war deposits should be paid according to the face value, but the interest rate will be slightly increased, roughly increased to 300 times or 500 times, that is, a deposit of one yuan before the war can be paid 300 yuan or 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Tightening Credit Chongqing Yarn Numbers Panic</h3>
<p>More than 50 will go bankrupt, the industry is holding a meeting to seek aftercare</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 17th] Due to the recent surge in yarn prices in the Chongqing cotton yarn gang, they are vying to make short sales. The interest rates were universally tight the day before yesterday. Banks are tightening credit, so most of them cannot handle the receipt and delivery. If one occurs, it will immediately affect the whole city. As of noon today, more than 50 yarn factories in the cotton flower street area are planning to close down. The cotton yarn industry guild is now calling an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors to seek aftercare. Some yarn merchants are asking mediators to intercede with various creditors, admitting to repaying debts in installments, in order to avoid the name of bankruptcy, but because the proposed repayment time is as late as the year after next, the tense situation cannot actually be alleviated.</p>
<h3>Gauze Declined Sales Stagnant Interest Rates Too Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market took a sharp turn for the worse. The guest sales were particularly palatable in the midst of the tired domestic market news. 20-count yarn, except for the special Double Horse, the rest of the large and small brands all dropped by 30,000 to 40,000. The 16-count yarn was particularly stagnant, because the cost of towel factories was not cost-effective, and there was even less interest. Fine yarn also fell by 135,000, and the trend is still very weak.</p>
<p>The cloth market was still weak and powerless yesterday, because there were no guest sales at all, and the cloth prices in Hankou and Tianjin also had a downward trend, and there are still many goods that have been purchased by various gangs but have not yet been loaded, so sales are stagnant. Although Fangjian's asking price was reduced to 2,000 yuan, there were still few applicants. The interest rate has not turned loose, and the actual sales are stagnant, which are the two major reasons for the weakness.</p>
<h3>Truth About Gasoline Price Increase Oil Prices Have Not Moved, Expenses Have Increased Slightly, and There is No Reason for Taxis to Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers reported that all gas stations in the city announced a price increase on the morning of the 16th, an increase of 150 yuan per gallon compared with the 15th, which was 1,300 yuan. Therefore, the Taxi Industry Association also plans to convene a meeting in the next few days to continue adjusting prices. According to this newspaper's investigation, the price of gasoline is originally divided into two types: one is the delivery price of the Pudong oil depot, which is 1,060 yuan per gallon, and has not changed. The other is the delivery price of gas stations in the city. The old price was 1,150 yuan, and the difference of 90 yuan is the transportation and labor costs from the Pudong oil depot to the barge, transported to Puxi, poured into the oil tanker, and then transported to the gas station and poured into the small oil pool. This difference of 90 yuan was originally stipulated in March of this year, and it has been 7 months since then. Various oil companies have repeatedly wanted to increase it, but it has not been achieved. Recently, due to the huge deficit in revenue and expenditure, they have especially increased it by 150 yuan, which is 240 yuan, so the delivery price of the Pudong oil depot will not be changed, and it is still 1,060 yuan, plus a difference of 240 yuan, which is the new gas station price of 1,300 yuan. If the taxis in this city increase the selling price of gasoline by 150 yuan per gallon, they will have to increase it by 3,000 yuan per hour, in other words, each car needs to use more than 20 gallons per hour, which is definitely not the case. Therefore, if taxis ask for such a large price increase, it is definitely not due to the increase in gasoline prices.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Profit Tax in the 34th Year, the City Chamber of Commerce Discussed the Principles, and Those Who Have Not Filled in the Report Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Simplified Collection of Profit Tax in the 34th Year: Three months ago, Wang Fuzhou of the Tax Bureau came to Shanghai and hosted leaders of the Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association at the International Hotel, announcing that the budget for the collection of profit tax for the first category of profit-making businesses in the city was 60 billion yuan. The industry and commerce were greatly shocked. The various industry associations filled in the report of the capital amount, turnover, and net profit of each member to the Chamber of Commerce, and asked the Chamber of Commerce to strive to reduce the assessment to the government based on the actual situation. The Chamber of Commerce also specially set up a tax specialist committee to preside over the matter, and has been negotiating back and forth with the tax authorities for a long time. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the persons in charge of ten important industry associations such as cotton spinning, dyeing, cotton cloth, silk satin, department stores, enamel, cigarette rolling, rubber, and paper were convened to discuss the specific methods of reporting and paying taxes. The Chamber of Commerce was attended by Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilun, Luo Qinghua, Pan Shihao, and others. After a long period of discussion, it is heard that the principles have been decided, but because the amount reported by each industry is too different from the government's budget, it will be increased to a certain extent in accordance with the simplified collection precedents of the rear. Those who have not yet filled in the report will be severely punished by the Secret Affairs Authority. At 4:00 PM this Saturday, a large number of industry associations will be convened again to announce the universal increase method, so that they can jointly comply.</p>
<h3>Carnation Milk Powder Prices Fall, Orders Arrive, Hoarded Goods Come Out</h3>
<p>After the war, American Carnation milk powder sold well in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas. Because of its cheap price and good quality, the Chinese people like to use it very much. Later, hoarders saw that the goods were profitable, so they hoarded them one after another. When the exchange rate rose, the price was even higher for a while. The retail price of each 5-pound can was as high as 35,000 yuan. It is now learned that the orders for the second half of the year have arrived, and hoarders have come out one after another. The goods are more expensive and the prices have fallen. The retail price of a 5-pound can is only 26,000 to 7,000 yuan. Yesterday's wholesale price for a 5-pound can was 290,000 yuan per dozen.</p>
<h3>New Tea Sales Gradually Move</h3>
<p>Since Xiehe Foreign Company started processing Wenzhou New Zhenmei, Renji Foreign Company has also been involved. The process was protracted due to the seller's insistence, and finally made progress. Other new Wenhong and Xin Bailin are also being consulted by export companies. As for the high-quality Chencha, although the buying interest is still enthusiastic, the supply is scarce and the transaction is declining. Chen Wenhong, Indian merchants, foreign companies and the goods side have a lively transfer, and the market is prosperous. The domestic sales of red and green tea are still only fried green tea, and the street sales are still good, and the rest are narrow.</p>

<h3>China Trust Bureau Officially Sold Artificial Silk Yesterday, the Black Market Collapsed, and Manufacturers Applied for About 700 Boxes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau, as an agent for selling government materials, the Property Committee, officially sold artificial silk yesterday. The opening price was 2.8 million yuan per box for 120-count bright and semi-bright Tianqiao brand artificial silk, and 2.75 million yuan per box for 120-count bright assorted brand artificial silk. The target of this distribution is temporarily limited to manufacturers. The Silk Weaving Industry Association compiled and registered a total of 315 manufacturers applying for a total of 694 boxes and one package of artificial silk before 10:00 AM yesterday. The China Trust Bureau is expected to allocate all of them according to the plan. According to the distribution method, each manufacturer needs to pay off all the loans today, but because of the tight time, the manufacturers and the China Trust Bureau have agreed that all of them will be paid off before 12:00 noon tomorrow. It is heard that the monthly distribution volume of the China Trust Bureau is about 2,500 boxes. Because it has passed half a month this month, it is about 1,500 boxes. The next distribution date has been set for next Monday. According to Liu Qingyi, the executive director of the Silk Identification Industry Association, the China Trust Bureau currently distributes artificial silk twice a week and will never be interrupted, so I hope that colleagues in the industry will not hoard and avoid eating their own fruit. At present, the fabrics used by colleagues in the industry mostly use 75-count and 150-count artificial silk, and I hope to quickly change to 120-count. It is heard that 6,000 boxes of Japanese artificial silk will continue to arrive in Shanghai in November.</p>
<p>In addition, China Textile Construction Company also has more than 330 boxes of miscellaneous brand artificial silk, which are jointly distributed with the China Trust Bureau. There are a total of three types: 120-count bright semi-bright miscellaneous brand artificial silk, and the price per box is also 2.75 million yuan. One is 50-count semi-bright miscellaneous brand artificial silk, and the price per box is 2.45 million yuan, a total of 206 boxes. The target of this distribution is mainly artificial silk merchants, one box per household. If the manufacturers have been allocated in this period, the quantity will be deducted from the quantity that each manufacturer should be allocated by the China Trust Bureau this month. Yesterday, the artificial silk market opened weak, and the 120 Tianqiao bright was called 4.2 million yuan, and no one asked about it. Then it fell to 4.1 million yuan at the close. It was even more empty in the afternoon, and there was no transaction when it was called 4 million yuan. As a result, it was 350,000 yuan shorter than the previous day, and the other numbers also fell by 300,000 to 350,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Wild Rise and Fall of Chinese Stocks: Initial Anxiety Followed by Delight</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks experienced an even more dismal situation yesterday. Trading volume in the market was unprecedentedly low. Even the previously popular Yong Yarn shares at times faced a lack of interest. Off-market brokerages feared they had no chance of recovery and continued to decline. However, rumors of favorable settlements suddenly boosted buying interest. From the opening in the morning until the noon closing, a steep decline occurred every half hour. Although there were several small rebounds midway, the sellers remained as steadfast as Mount Tai, showing no panic. The buying pressure was ultimately overwhelmed, and prices fell to their lowest levels near noon. Before the closing bell, there was a slight rise. The noon closing results showed that, except for Rongfeng, China Silk, Liann An, and Five Harmonies, almost all stocks experienced significant drops. In the afternoon, carrying on the momentum from the post-market rally, the market immediately stabilized. Support from the Cantonese community appeared, transforming the situation. At the same time, short sellers covered their positions, gradually pushing prices higher. Moreover, the growing rumors of favorable settlements further strengthened investor confidence. Due to next-day settlement arrangements, the market reversed its course near the closing bell, rapidly climbing significantly. Yong Yarn, Mayer, New Light, Qinxing, Xinn He, Matches, and Huotong all exceeded their morning highs. However, China Silk shares fell below their previous lows. Compared to the previous closing prices, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and New Light saw slight decreases, while Mayer and Qinxing experienced slight increases. Among the less active stocks, China Textile, Rongfeng, Matches, and New Asia Company each experienced slight declines. Datong, Lian An, Hua Feng, Five Harmonies, and Cement remained unchanged. Unified, China Silk, Jinglun, and Underwear each fell by half a percent. The total trading volume for both the morning and afternoon sessions reached 7 million shares. Off-market stocks continued to fall.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially appeared weak, but later, with the arrival of foreign firms and strong rumors of listing, they rebounded. Yi Yarn rose from 8,300 yuan to around 9,000 yuan. The closing results showed that Yi Yarn, Paper, Yi Beer, and Asian Steel all experienced squeezes. British United saw a slight decline, while others remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Saving the Tea Industry: Economic and Financial Ministries Pass the Buck; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Urges Swift Action</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requested that the authorities continue to handle tea barter trade and other matters. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating: “Upon examination of the four items mentioned in the affiliated association’s telegram, except for tax exemption, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the remaining three items are related to your Ministry’s responsibilities. We are deeply disappointed and perplexed by the instruction to ‘forward a letter to the Ministry of Finance for review.’ Furthermore, we have received a Western-style telegram from the Ministry of Finance, Jing Shui San Zi No. 7398, stating: ‘We have received your telegram Dai 0350 Zi No. 140 from September. After investigating the export of tea, the government, to encourage exports, has approved tax exemptions or rebates as proposed. However, strict regulations should be implemented regarding tax exemption procedures to prevent abuse. The Taxation Administration is currently consulting on the review, and once finalized, it will be widely implemented. As for the requests for continued export subsidies, continued tea barter trade, and using economic diplomacy to expand markets, these fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.’ This contradicts your Ministry’s intention to ‘forward a letter to the Ministry of Finance for review.’ To save international trade, swift action is crucial. We respectfully request that your Ministry take early action. If you believe it is necessary to consult with other ministries, please promptly send a letter for consultation.”</p>
<h3>Rising Prices for Chaozhou Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chaozhou sugar market became firm due to scarce supply, while other sugars remained flat or weak.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Barter Trade: Taiwan Sugar is in High Demand in Japan for the Next Year’s Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Sino-Japanese barter trade arrangements for the next year are currently being negotiated by a specialist from the Central Trust Bureau in Japan. The specialist has not yet returned. It is reported that both sides intend to expand the scope of the barter. In addition to transportation equipment, which was included this year, items needed by China from Japan will include generators, locomotives, and mining equipment. Taiwan Province, which was previously part of the Japanese colonial economic construction system, now that it has been separated, has a very high demand for industrial equipment from Japan. As for the goods that China can supply to Japan, in addition to the salt and bran from this year, it is planned to add soybeans from North China and grass cloth from Guangdong. Japan is also very eager for Taiwan sugar, but China's self-sufficiency is insufficient and is unwilling to export it, which affects people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Requesting Exemption of Unified Tax on Exported Wool Products</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently stated that the unified tax rate on wool products is similar to the general customs export tax. If the export tax is waived but the unified tax is levied instead, the burden on exporters will be doubled compared to before the export tax exemption. This goes against the government's intention to promote export trade. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, a petition was submitted to the Ministry of Finance requesting that, following the precedent of tax exemption for exported tea, all exported wool products that have not been taxed should be exempted, and those that have been taxed should be refunded. This would increase the export opportunities for domestic goods.</p>

Director Chen Xuanzhen presided over the meeting and briefly stated: "This morning, we have invited Mr. Xie Xunchu to give a lecture on middle school teaching problems, and this afternoon, we have invited Mr. Shen Yizhen to discuss middle school administrative organization and equipment problems. This symposium is to review how the supervisory work should be carried out, and we have specially invited educational experts to participate in the discussion." Then, Xie Xunchu gave his lecture. Xie said: "Current teaching seems to be going down a narrow path, focusing only on the students' academic performance and not studying how students perform well or poorly. First of all, it should be clarified that teaching should be based on learning. The relationship between teaching and learning is how students learn, and then how teachers teach. We must first study the method of learning, and then study the method of teaching." He gave two examples of written language teaching and composition teaching to analyze the learning steps of students and the guidance methods of teachers. The supervisors who listened all agreed that Xie's talk was based on his practical experience in educational research. Finally, Xie emphasized that the center of all problems in education is the teaching problem. We must use scientific methods to solve the difficult problems in teaching. He also said that if the teaching problems in primary and secondary schools are not solved by scientific methods, the teaching performance will not be improved. In the afternoon, Shen Yizhen gave a lecture. Shen briefly stated: "Regarding the issue of middle school administrative organization, there must be a basic concept, that is, to make the best use of talents, make the best use of resources, and spend money wisely, so that the efficiency of educational administration can be improved. As for the factors of administrative organization, there are no more than (1) expansion of educational opportunities, (2) progress of educational science, (3) the responsible educational administrative agencies and their laws, (4) the history of the school, (5) the environment of the school, (6) the implementation of national policies, (7) the school's finances, and (8) the school's talent. We must study all of these together in order to generate a reasonable and good school administrative organization. What is a good administrative organization? It can be divided into (1) division of labor, (2) clear responsibilities, (3) vertical and horizontal connections, (4) economy, and (5) proper personnel coordination. Furthermore, how to use the administrative organization can be divided into (1) effective leadership, (2) participation of all teachers, (3) opportunities for review, and (4) assessment." Then, he raised the issue of middle school equipment, first explaining the reasons for the expansion of modern school equipment, which are no more than (1) increased educational opportunities, (2) increased wealth of the country and people, (3) industrial development, and (4) improved educational standards. Speaking of the types of equipment, he introduced a survey by Koos of the United States of 156 schools' school building equipment, each of which was found at least three times or more and included in the statistics, totaling 109 types. Finally, he spoke of the standards for equipment, using the book "Middle School Building Standards" published in the United States as an example, saying that school building standards can be divided into seven categories: (1) location 100 points, (2) construction 155 points, (2) general equipment 270 points, (4) classrooms 145 points, (5) special classrooms 140 points, (6) public places 140 points, (7) offices 50 points, totaling 1,000 points. This is a school building evaluation table. If it is below 500 points, it is not qualified. This evaluation table may be used as one of the research materials for inspecting school buildings in Shanghai. After the lecture, the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m.</p>

<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium</h3>
<p>Half-Price Lung Disease Checkups for Students</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on September 6th, Dr. Shandao Jimmo, a lung tuberculosis expert from the United Nations, stated at a press conference that the high rate of lung disease patients in China must be treated as a social disease and given attention. The rate of this disease is especially high among students, exceeding the rate among adults in other parts of the world by four or five times. Because China has failed to obtain basic hygiene facilities and personal preventive examinations, millions of people will die from lung disease. This year's X-ray examination of 3,224 people showed that the age of patients was from 18 to 33 years old, accounting for 73% of the total number of patients, and the number of young people with lung tuberculosis is shocking. The Hongqiao Sanatorium, located at 990 Linsen Road in this city, in view of this situation, has specially agreed with the various university federations that all new students must undergo X-ray anti-tuberculosis examinations in order to eliminate the source of infection. All students with sufficient proof can prevent the spread of infection, protect their health, and ensure public safety.</p>

<h3>Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament: Huayan Wuben Wins</h3>
<p>The Guo Zhen Cup men's and women's volleyball tournament, originally scheduled for two games today, was held earlier at 5:30 p.m. yesterday at the gymnasium. The strength of the two sides was vastly different, so the result was that Wuben and Huayan both eliminated their opponents Fuhua in straight sets. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wuben defeated Fuhua (Women) 21-9, 21-9, 22-20. (2) Huayan defeated Huaguang (Men) 21-6, 21-3, 21-9.</p>
<h3>The Zhung Lun Team Suffers Defeat to Inskas Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lack of Experience Leads to Panic</p>
<p>The Luoyang Zhung Lun basketball team lost to Inskas in their fourth match last night due to a lack of experience and confusion. The result was 51 to 32. In the first half, Zhung Lun was only behind by four points, 19 to 15. The Zhung Lun team last night seemed completely different from when they defeated the Giants the night before. Because they were panicked and unable to calm down, the whole team lost contact and became a mess. They also missed their shots, due to their inability to calm down in a big game. Inskas, on the other hand, played very smoothly and made every shot. The Westerners were in the lead all the way in the first half. Zhung Lun chased to 19 to 15, only two points behind. In the second half, Zhung Lun fell sharply and collapsed, which was very regrettable. The result was 51 to 32, a difference of 19 points.</p>

<h3>In the Lush Green Soybean Field A Horrific Massacre The Blood Debt of Forty Citizens in Xitangqiao, Changshu — Sun Jingzhi</h3>
<p>The Tyranny of the Enemy's Military Police</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Dong Deren, a reader of this newspaper, mentioned in a letter, "...In Tangqiao, twenty or thirty people were taken away by the enemy's military police and swept away by aircraft." Recently, we received a manuscript from Mr. Sun Jingzhi, confirming that it was a true and undeniable matter. Mr. Sun is from Tangqiao and personally experienced the tragedy. The article truthfully describes the situation in detail, and its purpose is very important: First, it can be used as a reference for military tribunals; second, it can allow righteous people in the world to understand more about the atrocities of the Japanese army; and third, it can also alert the Chinese people not to be forgetful because of leniency. - Editor -</p>
<p>The Beginning of a Tragic Story</p>
<p>When the reporter picked up this pen, his heart was under some kind of strong oppression, and he was palpitating very badly. I don't know what tone and what words I should use to describe the following tragic story without any omission. Everyone admits that the warlords of Japanese imperialism are murderous demons. In this large-scale war of aggression, on the front lines and in the occupied areas, they have used their cruel bestiality and vicious methods to kill many innocent compatriots and create many tragedies. What I want to report here is one of the thousands of facts in this regard.</p>
<p>In describing the beginning of this story, the first thing to make clear is that this tragedy occurred in the autumn of July or August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (the month and date can be investigated). It was the season when the golden wind was refreshing and the edamame was just bearing fruit. Changshu had only been occupied for a year, and the enemy's forces only occupied a city area, and the surrounding areas were all in the hands of guerrillas. At that time, the organization of the guerrillas was independent and unsystematic. Their role was to resist Japan and protect the people (in fact, most of them were afraid of the Japanese army, but extortion and other things did not occur), so they were generally welcomed by the local people.</p>
<p>The Guerrilla Leader of Tangqiao</p>
<p>Tangqiao is a large market town more than thirty miles outside the west gate of Changshu. At this time, the Japanese army rarely passed through there. On the one hand, the town's self-defense forces were also very strong, and there was no disturbance from bandits, so many people from the city or various villages came to take refuge, and the market was booming for a while. The guerrilla leader stationed in Tangqiao at that time was Pang Yun, who had hundreds of soldiers. (The rural guerrilla force was already considered very large.) He had complete firearms and strong strength, so he had a great reputation in all directions. The Japanese army, on the one hand, saw his power and feared him, and on the other hand, wanted to use him, but Pang Yun always stood still. Sometimes he even clashed with the Japanese army (such as destroying highways, bridges, etc.). At that time, his trend was very expanding, and many aspects surrendered to him, and he slowly established contact with other places. The enemy was very afraid of him, so he foreshadowed a conspiracy to destroy his troops. Beforehand, there was a lot of news in Tangqiao Town that the Japanese army was coming to sweep.</p>
<p>Guns and Cannons Attacked from Three Sides</p>
<p>That day, at five o'clock in the morning (the date is not clear, probably the 26th day of the seventh lunar month, which is expected to be tested), the sky was not yet bright, and gunshots were found in the east of Tangqiao. Then the north and south sides followed, and the gunshots became more and more urgent, and closer and closer. In the middle, there were also the strange continuous sounds of machine guns and the booming sounds of grenade launchers. I still remember the sound of bullets rushing and hitting the roof ridge at that time, and the roaring sound of small steel cannons, which were played vividly, simply making every Tangqiao person tremble on the ground. About half an hour later, the sky slowly turned white, and the gunshots also thinned out. The sky was bright, and the scene on the street had changed. The Japanese army was all over the streets, searching and harassing from house to house. At that time, the residents were so scared that they did not dare to go out, knowing that the Japanese army was coming to sweep. According to the confirmed results of the investigation: when the Japanese army swept into the streets this time, all the guerrillas had gone away. Therefore, what they seized were only some broken and unusable firearms and three people suspected of being guerrillas. One was District Chief Qian Choushen, one was shop assistant Song Wengui, and the other was a formal guerrilla member. The district chief's detention was because he stood up on his own, because he had to maintain local security and had to come out to entertain. Later, he finally sacrificed for the people of the town. The shop assistant Song Wengui, because his shop was a rich family in the countryside and had a lot of contact with the guerrillas, on the one hand, a banner presented to Pang Yun by the people of the town was found in his shop, which not only destined Song Wengui to die, but also implicated the people of the town.</p>
<p>The Second Sweep by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>After the Japanese army issued a notice to appease the people, it began the second part of its sweeping work at 10:00 AM. He set fire to all the places where the guerrillas usually haunted, and the fire oil and firewood of each household were looted at once. It is estimated that the City God Temple, the Central Hotel in the center of the town, Song Wengui's dyeing workshop, and several civilian houses were burned because they were considered bandit dens. At that time, because firefighting was prohibited (in fact, no one dared to save), many people were affected, and the cries were only audible to wolves and dogs.</p>
<p>After the enemy carried out a large-scale burning, in order to distinguish whether the residents of the town were communicating with the guerrillas, they forced the residents of the town to go to the highway on the east street of the town, Niuweiba Bay, to conduct a large-scale interrogation (the author's home was more rural, so I was spared from going). They forced District Chief Qian Shoushen to confess truthfully (at that time, the district chief was considered to be elected by the guerrillas, but he was actually publicly recommended by the people, because Qian was a scholarly family and a good citizen). At that time, District Qian was afraid that he would die, and he could not confess, so he suffered a lot of whips, kicks, and physical pain. The enemy's military police also ordered him to hand over the town chief (surname Zhu, name to be tested, now the manager of a yarn number in Changshu). He also held this position concurrently, so Town Chief Zhu was spared. The Japanese army forced Song Wengui to confess. Poor Song Wengui was only eighteen or nineteen years old, and he could not confess. The Japanese military police had no way but to use another method to interrogate him.</p>
<p>A Unique Interrogation</p>
<p>The interrogation was like this: the Japanese called the residents of the town one by one to come forward and asked the interpreter to ask Song Wengui: "Do you know this person? What is his occupation?" If Song Wengui answered that he did not know, he would be considered a guerrilla and ordered to stand aside. Or, if your accent is not like a local, or if your situation and behavior are flustered, or if your answers are different, you will also be in trouble. (At that time, a barber from northern Jiangsu Province and a storyteller from Suzhou Province were killed because of this. The names of the above can be tested. Especially the storyteller, who had a strong national consciousness, which is worth noting here.) As a result of the interrogation, the crowd was divided into two realms: more than forty people stood under the shade of the trees, and a large group of people stood under the scorching sun. Because at that time they did not understand what this meant, there were also people who called friends and stole away, and those who were afraid of the sun automatically went to the shade of the trees. The district chief also stood in the shade of the trees. A villager surnamed Ma thought that the shade of the trees was a safe area and repeatedly slipped over, but was pulled back, and finally slipped over again. Who could have imagined that these people under the shade of the trees were "dead men"? These wronged ghosts can be regarded as an episode in the tragedy. (Note: The villager surnamed Ma is the nephew of the author's domestic worker, which is reliable.)</p>
<p>Forty People Were Innocent Executed</p>
<p>After the interrogation was over, the Japanese military police tied up the forty or so people standing in the shade of the trees with a rope. On the one hand, they announced the release of the remaining group and made a speech: The general idea was that these forty or so people were all bad elements and would be executed immediately. I hope that others will be good citizens. On the one hand, after the release, they drove this group of poor people into the lush green soybean field and told them to kneel down. The brutal Japanese army set up machine guns on the highway. According to what one of the people who escaped from the tiger's mouth said later: (This person can be investigated) At that time, they saw the situation and begged for help, and the cries were indescribable. Snap, snap, a few simple sounds, and they all fell down. (District Chief Qian Shoushen, Song Wengui, and a guerrilla soldier were all inside, and the rest were all common people. The names can all be investigated) The violent Japanese completed the last scene of their massacre. According to the person who escaped from death, after the Japanese army swept, they went around for three or four weeks, and those who were still struggling were rewarded with bayonets. (Note: This person was spared because he was lying under the bloody corpse, breathing motionless. One of his fingers was hit by a bullet, and his name can be investigated.) After the Japanese army completed its massacre, it went its separate ways, leaving only a gust of Xiao Xiao's autumn wind and the blood of more than forty innocent compatriots splashed on the lush green soybean leaves.</p>
<p>The tragic story is over here, and the reporter reiterates. This is a true fact. I was only eleven or twelve years old at that time, but the terrible memory in my young mind is deepening as I get older. In the past eight or nine years, I have never forgotten it, so I can absolutely guarantee that there is no inaccuracy. I only regret that I can't write articles well. Maybe this article of mine is too peaceful, but the fact is true, the fact is more tense, more terrifying, and more tragic. I believe that the people of Xitangqiao will leave this terrible stimulus to their descendants even after a hundred years, and will never let it be submerged.</p>
<p>Map of the Situation around the Battle of Jining (Specially Drawn by the Newsroom of This Newspaper)</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Battle of Jining: News from Fengzhen on the 5th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan</h3>
<p>Before the PingSui Railway was built, Jining was just a desolate mountain village called Laoya Zui (Crow's Beak), with only forty or fifty households. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, after the train laid sleepers from Fengzhen to Laoya Zui, because its name "Shou" was not well-known, the name of the spring in the flat land twenty miles south of Laoya Zui was chosen as the station name. Therefore, on many provincial maps, we only see Pingdi Quan (Flatland Spring) and often cannot find Jining. The former Pingdi Quan is now renamed Lao Pingdi Quan (Old Flatland Spring). Jining was established as a new county in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China when General Feng Yuxiang supervised the Northwest Border Defense. It was located in Pingdi Quan and governed the area east of Liangcheng Zhuozi Mountain and north of Fengzhen Guancun.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of a Strategic Situation</p>
<p>Pingdi Quan is 360 li east of Zhangjiakou, 320 li west of GuiSui, 270 li south of Datong, and more than 400 li north of Pangjiang, south of the Outer Mongolian border. It stands at the crossroads of these important towns in the three provinces of Jin, Cha, and Sui. The arrival of the PingSui Railway in Pingdi Quan further increased its military value and made it a city for foreign Mongolian trade and the concentration of grain production in Sui East and Cha North. During Xu Shuzheng's frontier planning period, an airport and barracks were built in Pingdi Quan. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, General Feng Yuxiang built the PingPang Highway to Pangjiang, making it accessible in all directions. To the south, it could guard the gateway to Shanxi; to the north, it could cut off the Zhangku Highway and oversee the movements of Outer Mongolia; and to the left and right, it could support the capitals of the two provinces of Cha and Sui.</p>
<p>Jining, GuiSui, and Datong stand in a tripod formation, while Jining, Zhangjiakou, and Datong also form a mutually supportive position. Therefore, after the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of this year, the Communists did not first attack Datong but instead forcibly occupied Jining. After Jining was captured, they immediately launched an offensive against Datong. If Datong were to fall, the situation in GuiSui would be unimaginable. Therefore, in order to relieve Datong and protect GuiSui, the National Army had to recover Jining, and in order to besiege Datong and consolidate Zhangyuan, the Communists had to defend Jining. Thus, the fierce Battle of Jining, following the Battle of Siping Street, was triggered. The so-called Jining Victory reversed the precarious situation in the north, and its significance lies in this.</p>
<p>Pingdi Quan is 1,400 meters above sea level, and the climate is particularly high and cold. Around May and June, snowflakes can still be seen flying at night. The train from GuiSui to Jining and from Datong to Jining both travel uphill. West to Zhuozi Mountain and east to Guancun are rolling hills. East to Zhangjiakou, the train passes through a plain before entering the mountain valley. North to Pangjiang, there is no need to cross ridges and mountains to reach the瀚海 basin. The county seat is built on a flat beach surrounded by mountains on the southwest and the Guanwang River on the northeast. It is difficult to approach the city walls from the northeast, and even if one enters the city through the Bawang River, it is impossible to gain a foothold due to the control of the mountain peaks on the southwest. Therefore, Jining is easy to defend and difficult to attack.</p>
<p>Protecting Jining are three famous mountains. These three mountains are not particularly steep, but they have military value due to their proximity to the city of Jining. Because all the hills outside Jining are not as high as these mountains. The famous mountain west of the city is called Wolong Mountain (Sleeping Dragon Mountain), which faces the west gate of Jining and protects the southwest corner of the city. The mountain south of the city was originally called Huangjia Liang (Huang Family Ridge). In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Tang Enbo's troops built excellent national defense works here, so it was renamed Tiejun Mountain (Iron Army Mountain). During the Japanese occupation, a fortified barracks was built in the depression between Wolong Mountain and Tiejun Mountain to fill the gap between the two mountains. The mountain southeast of the city is called Laohu Mountain (Tiger Mountain), which not only overlooks the entire city but also monitors the grassland through which the Bawang River flows. During the construction of national defense works in the twenty-sixth year, tunnels were built, leading to the basement of the county government office.</p>
<p>Jining is the only county town with an urban scale on the PingSui Railway. The railway runs through the city from north to south, dividing the entire city into two parts: the east side of the railway is called Qiaodong (East of the Bridge), and the west side is called Qiaoxi (West of the Bridge). During the Feng Yuxiang era, there were eighteen main roads. Now there are only eight roads with shops and households, surrounded by earthen city walls, with concrete steel-reinforced bunkers underneath. Because Jining was very prosperous in the past and surrounded by stone mountains, the buildings in the city are quite tall and sturdy. For example, the station, water tower, railway hospital, worker residences, locomotive yard, electric company, county government in Qiaodong, and the Fuzhetang, flour company, mosque, post and telecommunications bureau, police station, and Mengjiang Hotel in Qiaoxi can all be turned into defensive fortifications for street fighting by simply piling up sandbags and installing barbed wire.</p>
<p>Communist Defense Deployment</p>
<p>After forcibly occupying Jining on January 18th of this year, the Communists began to repair the national defense works from before the twenty-sixth year and strengthen the fortifications built by the Japanese invaders after the twenty-sixth year. They spent four or five months building these fortifications. Their operational plan for defending Jining was to hold key strongholds with a small number of elite troops, and use a large number of troops to encircle the periphery in order to attract the National Army to the city of Jining, and then encircle and annihilate them. In July and August of this year, they mobilized troops from the "JinSui" and "SuiMeng" military regions to conduct four or five offensive and defensive exercises. They were confident that after first dispelling the National Army's spirit in Zhuozi Mountain, they would be able to crush the National Army into minced meat on the outskirts of Jining and make dumplings.</p>
<p>Their original plan was for the Independent First Brigade of the "SuiMeng Military Region" to hold Zhuozi Mountain for two days to wait for the arrival of the Fourth Brigade and the Training Brigade and engage the National Army in a field battle. Who would have thought that the Independent First Brigade only held Zhuozi Mountain for two and a half hours before losing the fortifications with six layers of defense? The Fourth Brigade, which had reached the Eighteen Stations, and the Training Brigade, which had reached Niujia Chuan, also suffered devastating blows from the National Army. Therefore, they abandoned the field battle and assigned the Twenty-seventh Regiment of the Second Brigade of the "JinSui Military Region," the Ninth Regiment of the "SuiMeng Military Region," the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade, and the Guard Battalion of the "SuiMeng Military Region" as the defending troops. The defense position of the Twenty-seventh Regiment was on Tiejun Mountain, the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade was on Wolong Mountain, and the Guard Battalion of the "SuiMeng Military Region" was on Laohu Mountain. In addition, there were more than 10,000 troops of unknown designation, commanded by Yao Zhe, commander of the "SuiMeng Military Region," to defend various strongholds in Qiaodong and Qiaoxi.</p>
<p>According to prisoners of war, the Communist forces participating in the Battle of Jining this time numbered about seventeen brigades, fifty-one regiments, totaling more than ten thousand people. We discovered units such as the New Fourth Brigade, the Independent Fourth Brigade, the Provisional Fourth Brigade, the 358th Brigade, the Training Brigade, the Independent First Brigade, the Independent Second Brigade, and the Fourth Column of the Guerrilla Detachment of the "JinJiCha Military Region" on the periphery of Jining. The Communist defense of Jining distributed three-quarters of its forces on the periphery. Before Zhuozi Mountain was recovered, the villages near Jining were stationed with all the elite troops of the "JinSui Military Region." After Zhuozi Mountain was recovered, most of the troops of Nie Rongzhen's "JinJiCha Military Region," which had been besieging Datong, were also transferred to the command of He Long's deputy commander Zhang Zongxun to participate in the Battle of Jining.</p>
<p>Our Side's Offensive Posture</p>
<p>In this Battle of Jining, both sides had more than 100,000 troops. Our side set out in three routes. The left-wing "Fuxing" Column was entirely cavalry, composed of the "Tieqi" (Iron Cavalry), "Qingshan" (Green Mountain), and "Changcheng" (Great Wall) detachments. They spread out from Wuchuan through Taolin to the PingPang Highway and the Fengji Railway Line, in order to both block the Communist援軍 from Shangdu and cut off the communication between Fengzhen and Jining. The right-wing "Tangsheng" Column was based on the "Huiguang" (Return Light) and "Zhengdong" (East Expedition) detachments, combined with cavalry detachments such as "Xianfeng" (Vanguard), and attacked Tianjia Zhen (Old Ningyuan City) from GuiSui, heading straight for the outskirts of Liangcheng, Fengzhen, searching in the Dahai Po Plain, so that the Communist forces in Sui East and Yan North could not coordinate with each other. Our main force, the "Lijin" Column, led the "Shengli" (Victory), "Shaonian" (Youth), and "Huanghe" (Yellow River) detachments, advancing east along the railway line on September 1st. On the morning of the fifth, the "Shengli" detachment, in coordination with the "Shaonian" detachment, captured Zhuozi Mountain, and then crossed the mountains north of the railway, arriving at the Tuchengzi area northwest of Jining on the eighth. On the afternoon of the ninth, they entered the attack preparation position. When the attack was launched on the tenth, the "Shengli" and "Huanghe" detachments assaulted the city, and the "Shaonian" detachment was used as a reserve force to encircle the urban area from the southwest. On that day, the "Shengli" detachment seized Tiejun and Wolong Mountains, the "Huanghe" detachment was blocked from breaking into the city from the west, and the "Shaonian" detachment suffered wave-like encirclement attacks from the Communist outer forces. From the afternoon of the tenth to the morning of the twelfth, the situation was deadlocked. On the twelfth, the "Shengli" detachment occupied Qiaoxi. In the afternoon, the "Guoguang" detachment of the "Tangsheng" Column was sent to reinforce. After a night of bloody battle, the army began to withdraw on the afternoon of the thirteenth. Our side completely recovered Jining after midnight.</p>
<p>There was another attacking force of the National Army, namely the armed returning people from the Yan North, Cha North, and Sui East regions led by the Democratic Defense Work General Team. These soldiers, wearing leather jackets and headscarves, played a significant and decisive role in the Battle of Jining. The First General Team commanded by Yang Yuanfu and the Third General Team commanded by Zhao Dayi prevented the Communist forces in Yan North and Cha North from supporting Sui East. The Second General Team, led by Wei Chunmei, fully joined the various attacking National Army units in charging and breaking through enemy lines, and took on all the reconnaissance, guiding, transportation, and stretcher-bearing work, so that the National Army did not suffer any major losses and instead won brilliant victories. Therefore, Commander Chuan said: "The victory in this Battle of Jining is a victory of the people's will."</p>
<h3>Thrilling Outer Perimeter Battles: Consecutive Capture of Two Mountains</h3>
<p>On the dawn of September 10th, the main force "Lijin" column of the National Army launched an attack on the outer perimeter strongholds of Jining. The "Shengli" detachment was tasked with capturing Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, the "Huanghe" detachment was tasked with breaking into the city from the northwest direction, and the "Shaonian" detachment arrived at the line of Luotuo Bozi Houjia Village before dawn, serving as a reserve force for the attack and protecting the flanks of the entire army. The "Lijin" command post was also set up in Luotuo Bozi on the same day, with heavy equipment and supplies stationed in the Lama Temple west of Jining City. Our attack route was from northwest to southwest, then turning northeast to attack the city. After discovering the sounds of gunfire, the Communist outer perimeter forces moved from southeast to southwest, planning to encircle the northwest in a counter-encirclement.</p>
<p>The "Shengli" detachment, attacking Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, ordered the Second Detachment to capture Wolong Mountain and the Third Detachment to capture Tiejun Mountain simultaneously. The Communists had set up seven layers of defensive fortifications on these two mountain peaks. The first and second layers were minefields, the third layer was barbed wire, the fourth layer was an electric fence, the fifth layer was also barbed wire, the sixth layer was a wide and deep outer moat, and the seventh layer was a copper-reinforced concrete bunker surrounded by circular communication trenches. From the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain, the distance was about three li long. This time, the brave National Army was not afraid of death, and the stubborn Communist forces also did not want to lose their lives, so the battle was extremely fierce. We used heavy firepower to first block the firing holes of the bunkers, and then infantry stepped over the minefield and electric fence lines, jumped into the outer moat, and pounced on the top of the mountain, so the casualties were heavier than in previous battles.</p>
<p>After the "Shengli" detachment launched a simultaneous attack on Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, the Second Battalion competing for Wolong Mountain broke through the positions of the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade in one hour. Therefore, the Communist forces extracted a portion of the Twenty-seventh Regiment of the "JinSui Military Region" defending Tiejun Mountain to reinforce Wolong Mountain, and ordered the soldiers to jump out of the outer moat and engage the National Army in a self-destructive bayonet fight. As a result, the First Battalion of "Shengli" was blocked. After the Third Battalion first captured Tiejun Mountain, they sent a portion of fresh troops, passing through the southwest corner of Jining from the north of Tiejun Mountain, bypassing the back of Wolong Mountain, where two barracks with Communist troops were stationed, and attacking the defending Communist forces from both the front and rear, crushing them. Wolong Mountain was occupied before dusk.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Rural Women in Guilin</h3>
<p>— News from Guilin on the 8th, Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>In the eyes of Jia Baoyu, a romantic figure who appreciated his own talents, women were like gentle spring water. However, the women who grew up in the southern borderlands were, in people's eyes, like shrubs on a stone wall, mysterious and strong....</p>
<p>The women of Guangxi do not have the graceful and delicate beauty of the Suzhou Terrace, nor the natural beauty of the Northern land. From the most objective aesthetic point of view, health is their only advantage in terms of physique. They are crude and lack any delicacy. For thousands of years, apart from the legendary Green Pearl who grew up in Bobai Village, there have been no stories about peerless beauties. But I believe that when you hear that a woman is more capable than a man, you should feel that it is more beautiful than the story of a beauty!</p>
<p>Throughout the vast countryside, whether in the east, south, west, or north, from the mountains to the plains, women are the main force in agricultural affairs. From plowing and sowing to harvesting rice, from harvesting rice to winter plowing, chopping firewood, and cutting grass, there is nothing that is not a woman's job. What about men? Men have become women. Their jobs are to carry water, cook, deliver food, and take care of the family, and other than that, they are idle all day long, standing in the east, sitting in the west, drinking and gambling, living happily like pigs. (Of course, there are also some men who work together with women, but that is mostly in the poor mountain areas). Women and men sing mountain songs and go to the city to pay grain and rent, and sell rice on the market. With a bamboo hat on their shoulders, bare feet, and the leaping of their towering breasts hiding infinite vitality, plus a blush on their faces, who can say that a straight pine tree is not more beautiful than a weak willow?</p>
<p>"Men plow and women weave" is a traditional precept, but "women plow and women weave" is also a lovely reality. In the idle days of winter, women weave their own clothes with their own hands, as well as new clothes for their husbands and children, and take them to the market to sell cheaply. The women in Fuchuan and He County in Guilin East rely on weaving all year round, spinning yarn from August to December, and weaving from December to July. It is truly "chickens crow and enter the loom to weave, night after night without rest." The cloth they weave becomes other people's clothes, but they themselves wear tattered clothes painstakingly, so they have the saying that their clothes are "new for three years, old for three years, patched for three years." Even more pitiful is that many weaving girls wear out their entire youth on the loom, working for others, and in the end, the wealthy areas have become a city of sorrow for prolific old women.</p>
<p>Women who grow up in areas with backward consciousness and feudal remnants have infinite suffering. The marriage trading system still exists throughout the Guangxi countryside and even in the cities. A wife is indeed like a piece of clothing, and the right to decide whether to keep or discard her is entirely in the hands of vulgar men. Peasants selling their wives and officials selling their concubines are commonplace. A wife is "movable property." As long as she only says a few words to an unfamiliar man, not to mention anything else, after a ton of scolding, a matchmaker will come to raise someone to "marry a wife." However, it is a matter of course for a husband to go to the mountains to sing mountain songs and drink and make trouble with other women, or to take three or five concubines. It is even not uncommon to bet away money or pawn his wife when he is so poor that he has no other choice.</p>
<p>Due to the pain of marriage, coupled with women's strong self-reliance, a deformed phenomenon has become widespread in the countryside, and cannot be controlled by official laws. The specific term for this phenomenon is called "not settling in the husband's home." When a woman marries into her husband's family, she packs up her belongings and returns to her parents' home after three or seven days, farming and weaving for herself, living freely. She may or may not return to her husband's home for a year, or three, five, or seven years. She may stay in her husband's home for three or five days and then slip away, leaving her husband with nowhere to complain. There are many lawsuits arising from not settling in the husband's home. Women who stay in their parents' home do not do good things, and just a layer of sexual temptation leads to many scandals. So in some places (such as the countryside in Guinan, Wuming, and Du'an), women often return to their husband's homes only after their bellies are swollen in their parents' homes, and they shamelessly change to their husband's homes, without any "problems". Therefore, there is a joke: when you meet people in these places, never call them "big brother" or "old man." Otherwise, you are sure to be beaten.</p>

<h3>Modern Medical Treatment of Peptic Ulcers (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xue Bangqi</p>
<p>(C) Other Drug Treatments</p>
<p>We all know that patients with peptic ulcers, especially those with pyloric obstruction, often experience spasms in their stomach muscles. Therefore, the application of antispasmodic drugs is often effective in relieving symptoms and reducing the patient's pain. The commonly used antispasmodics are atropine or belladonna-like drugs. Other acid-neutralizing drugs, such as aluminum hydroxide gel, aluminum phosphate, and magnesium trisilicate, can be used as alternatives to Xuepei's powder, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Larostidine (i.e., Histldine) lacks specific effects on peptic ulcers. As early as 1936, the American Medical Association pointed out its low efficacy and uselessness. According to Kirby's rigorous clinical experiments, its therapeutic effect is even inferior to ordinary Xuepei therapy.</p>
<p>Recently, there are many over-the-counter drugs advertised on the market, but none of them are truly effective. Do not delay your illness by using them indiscriminately. Moreover, many drugs, if used improperly, can be harmful rather than beneficial. Do not blindly follow suit.</p>
<p>(D) Treatment of Gastric Bleeding</p>
<p>The treatment of gastric bleeding must be determined according to the amount of bleeding at the time and the consequences of the bleeding. Generally speaking, after discovering gastric bleeding, the patient should immediately lie in bed and rest completely. Many patients are often extremely frightened and nervous when bleeding, which increases gastric peristalsis. All of these are detrimental to recovery! Many family members around the patient panic and make a big fuss, which increases the patient's anxiety. This attitude is most undesirable! Therefore, for the sake of the patient, it is best to decline visits from all relatives and friends and give the patient a good rest. Even close family members such as spouses or parents and children should calmly serve by their side to comfort the patient. In terms of medical care, morphine injections can be given as appropriate to make the patient calm and comfortable and obtain true physical and mental rest.</p>
<p>In the case of massive bleeding, various emergency measures, such as blood transfusions or injections of glucose saline, can be used as appropriate to restore blood volume, prevent shock, and replenish water loss and other important symptoms. However, the method, timing, quantity, and speed of application must be carefully considered by the doctor before proceeding. Otherwise, improper timing, excessive transfusion volume, or excessive speed may increase bleeding!</p>
<p>In terms of diet, patients usually gradually start eating 24 to 48 hours after the bleeding stops. During the fasting period, if the patient is extremely thirsty, small ice cubes can be held in the mouth. Afterwards, the diet can strictly follow the Xuepei's diet and conditioning method mentioned above, but the initial amount should be halved.</p>
<p>Many doctors instruct to place an ice pack on the stomach to stop bleeding. This measure must also be considered according to the condition. If the patient has already shown signs of shock, or the application of the ice pack causes the patient to shiver, the result will not only be useless but counterproductive.</p>
<p>There are many hemostatic over-the-counter drugs on the market. Based on our experience, they have no special effect on gastric bleeding. This point is consistent with the opinions of foreign experts. Do not rely on them and neglect routine treatment, which may delay important matters!</p>
<p>(E) Surgical Treatment</p>
<p>This article does not intend to discuss the various surgical treatments for peptic ulcers. However, in what circumstances should surgical treatment be considered? The following can be listed:</p>
<p>(1) Acute gastric or duodenal perforation.</p>
<p>(2) Chronic ulcer perforation or gastric deformity after perigastritis.</p>
<p>(3) Ulcers with malignant tumor changes.</p>
<p>(4) Pyloric obstruction with definite and significant food retention.</p>
<p>(5) Repeated bleeding with no significant improvement with medical treatment.</p>
<p>(6) Chronic ulcers that are ineffective with other various treatments.</p>
<p>(F) Recently Introduced Highly Nourishing Therapy by Xu</p>
<p>(1) Development of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy</p>
<p>Since Xuepei's famous therapy was published in 1923, there has been no remarkable innovation in the treatment of peptic ulcers for more than 20 years. Until recently, Xu Zhaotui, a Chinese scholar, discovered during his research on protein metabolism in the United States that the application of high nourishment has excellent effects in treating peptic ulcers. From then on, a glimmer of dawn has appeared in the treatment, which is also the glory of the Chinese medical community.</p>
<p>When Xu returned to Shanghai this spring, he published part of his research work to his medical colleagues. In the beginning, Xu gave highly nourishing therapy to four patients with peptic ulcers who had decided to undergo surgery. The original purpose was to supplement the patient's physical strength and nutrition, hoping to benefit during the operation. However, to his surprise, four days later, the patient's stomach pain suddenly subsided, the symptoms subsided, and they could walk out of the hospital on their own without the need for surgery or continued treatment. Seeing such an extraordinary and superior result, Xu immediately continued to conduct large-scale research on highly nourishing therapy for peptic ulcers. The results further confirmed the superiority of his therapy and attracted the attention of medical circles around the world.</p>
<p>(2) Principles of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy</p>
<p>Xu uses amino acids (protein hydrolysates) plus glucose and maltose to replace the patient's entire diet. Xu himself explained the principles of this highly nourishing therapy as follows: (1) Amino acids (protein hydrolysates) have a gastric acid neutralizing effect. (2) Amino acids or protein hydrolysates are already digested proteins, which do not require further work from the stomach, so the stomach and upper duodenum can have sufficient rest. (3) Ample nutrition can increase healing ability and speed.</p>
<p>(3) Application of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy</p>
<p>Xu also has certain rules for the application method, which can be briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Application of drugs—(1) Amigen (containing 12% nitrogen). (2) Glucose and maltose.</p>
<p>Dosage—(1) Each kilogram of body weight is formulated with 60 cm units of nitrogen per day, that is, 5 cm of Amigen. (2) For example, if the patient weighs 50 kg, the daily requirement is 50 x 5 = 250 cm of Amigen. (3) Each cm of Amigen contains 3.7 calories, so the calories obtained from Amigen per day are 250 x 3.7 = 925 calories. (4) If the patient needs 2,000 calories per day, the insufficient calories are 2000-925=1075 calories, which are supplemented with glucose and maltose. The daily requirement is 1075+4=269 cm.</p>
<p>Administration—Divide the daily dose into eight or nine times according to the symptoms, and take it once every two hours. Use Yongchong to mix it.</p>
<p>Treatment date—Take it for two weeks first, and then handle it according to the situation.</p>
<p>We have no way to carry out large-scale application of Xu's highly nourishing therapy due to the lack of local medicines. We dare not say how effective or superior it is now. According to the results of 63 cases recently selected and treated by Xu: 47 were excellent, 13 were very good, and 13 were ineffective. However, these patients were all cases in which other drug treatments had completely failed. Today, Xu has such achievements, which is undoubtedly excellent, and it is more effective than the previous treatment methods.</p>
<p>The period of treatment for patients treated by Xu is still short, and it is difficult to predict whether there will be a recurrence in the future after recovery. Xu himself has repeatedly stated that his highly nourishing therapy can only turn progressive ulcers into a path to recovery, and there is no certainty that it can be cured. Highly nourishing therapy has now attracted the attention of medical circles everywhere, and the extent to which it can be developed in the future remains to be seen with continued research and progress.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned treatment sections are all closely related to each other. Be sure to take care of all aspects during treatment and do not focus on one thing and lose sight of the other. During the treatment period, the patient's cooperation, patience, trust in the doctor, and determination to undergo long-term treatment are all essential for success! We sympathize with the various difficulties of the patient's family in treatment and hope that in the near future, the medical community can have newer developments to shorten the treatment period and reduce the difficulty of treatment.</p>
<h3>A Little Knowledge Is the Most Likely to Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>—In consultation with the municipal health authorities regarding the training of Chinese medicine—</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes: A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing, which means that a little knowledge is the most likely to cause trouble. It is indeed a well-known saying. The reason why children are prone to causing trouble and suffering is that they have suffered from "a little knowledge."</p>
<p>On October 3, Dagongbao reported: "The Municipal Health Bureau believes that our Chinese medicine practitioners adhere to old methods and lack new knowledge, and plans to assist the Chinese Medicine Association in holding lectures to enable them to understand chemistry, physics, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, biomedicine, etc."</p>
<p>If this news is true and it is really implemented, it is tantamount to giving atomic bombs to children to play with. It is just as dangerous and just as unreasonable!</p>
<p>If Chinese medicine is to be scientific, unless all Chinese medicine is abandoned, there is no other way. Because culture is holistic, and science is especially holistic. What is not holistic and unsystematic is not science. Zhang Zhidong's policy of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for application" has already ruined the Manchu Qing Dynasty and suffocated the Republic of China. I hope the wise authorities will not be poisoned by this again. Naturally, the health authorities' policy of training Chinese medicine practitioners is exactly the opposite, which is to "Western learning as the foundation and Chinese learning for application," but its violation of the holistic nature of science and the creation of piecemeal false science are no different. The Tao is basically an inappropriate point.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, the characteristics of old medicine are mysterious, which is philosophized to put it nicely, and confused to put it frankly. The characteristic of scientific medicine is precision. One is one and two is two, and there must be no sloppiness or ambiguity. Good high school training is required (those with a slightly lower level cannot even pass the medical school entrance examination) plus more than six years of rigorous training, and its level is two to four years higher than that of ordinary universities. Such long-term and rigorous scientific training is absolutely necessary, because doctors deal with the health of patients, and the lives of patients are in their hands, so they must be trained to reach the stage of "thorough understanding," otherwise a little knowledge will easily cause trouble. Now the Health Bureau hopes to pass on the essence of scientific medicine to Chinese medicine practitioners who have not received good high school scientific training in a short period of time. It is not only impossible, but also extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>In medical schools, it is still difficult to pass on scientific medicine to medical students who have received scientific training, and those with slightly inferior qualifications often repeat classes and eventually drop out. Now, we want to use short-term lectures to hope to make Chinese medicine, which is mysterious and mysterious in terms of yin and yang and five elements, scientific. It is tantamount to seeking fish from trees and a fool's dream.</p>
<p>If it is forced to be implemented, it will inevitably create a large number of pseudo-scientific "Western medicine practitioners," and then all crimes will be attributed to "Western medicine practitioners."</p>
<p>Authentic "Chinese medicine practitioners" use herbs and bark with mild medicinal properties, which is not very dangerous. However, this disguised "Western medicine practitioner" applies scientific medicine drugs and other treatment methods in a half-understanding way, which is even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Because the drugs used in scientific medicine are either the essence of herbs and bark, or synthetic chemicals. Especially the latest special drugs, most of them have strong medicinal properties. In order to obtain their maximum therapeutic effect and avoid their harmful side effects, accurate diagnosis of pathogens and various tests must be made before they can be effective. As for various diagnostic and treatment methods, they must undergo rigorous specialized training before they can be used freely and without error.</p>
<p>Now, to try to combine this precise knowledge of scientific medicine with the yin and yang and five elements in the minds of Chinese medicine practitioners is not only incompatible, but will inevitably create a large number of disguised Western medicine practitioners with a little knowledge. How can we imagine the danger?</p>
<p>If you want to make Chinese medicine scientific, you must abandon all Chinese medicine and then lay a scientific foundation to accept all the training of scientific medicine. There is no other way. The policy of using Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for application will not work, and applying it to medicine is even more dangerous, extremely dangerous!</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, the death of a certain military leader in the capital due to the injection method of a certain Chinese medicine practitioner across the clothes, and the death of the young son of a certain leader in the capital during the Anti-Japanese War due to the morphine injection of a certain Chinese medicine practitioner are all examples of so-called "scientific Chinese medicine." I hope everyone will be vigilant.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the municipal health authorities will abandon this risky attempt.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Peptic Ulcers</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xueli</p>
<p>Peptic ulcers, commonly known as "stomach diseases," can be divided into two aspects: internal and external. The external ones affect the country, society, family, and relatives, while the internal ones cause lifelong suffering and can be fatal at any time. Now, let's briefly describe them in separate items as follows:</p>
<p>A. External: Peptic ulcers are extremely common. There are no reliable statistics in our country. According to the estimates of Hsrst and Srewart in the United Kingdom, about one-tenth of the population suffers from this disease at some point in their lives. It can be seen that the common degree of this disease is almost no less than that of active tuberculosis, so it is indeed a public enemy of the public. Fortunately, most patients recover on their own without knowing it after the acute period; a small number of patients, unfortunately, turn into chronic peptic ulcers, which affect their spirit and physical strength year after year. Although the commonality of this disease has no distinction between men, women, old, and young, men are often more likely to suffer from it than women due to living environment and other factors. The former is almost four times the latter. Young people who work hard, are mentally stressed, ambitious, and agile are especially prone to the disease. Personal career, family economy, and social and national progress are inevitably greatly affected.</p>
<p>B. Internal: In addition to harming the population, peptic ulcers have the following possible crises for individual patients. The occurrence of the crisis can be divided into acute and chronic; the acute ones progress silently without the patient's awareness. When the condition reaches a serious stage, the symptoms are discovered. The opportunity is often missed, resulting in difficulties in treatment, or even becoming an incurable disease. Now, let's briefly describe its outline to alert the Chinese people, hoping to prevent it before it happens, or treat it properly as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Acute Crisis</p>
<p>(1) Bleeding: Often peptic ulcers invade the deep part of the gastrointestinal wall, eroding blood vessels, the tube wall necroses, and bleeding occurs. If the bleeding is small, the patient may not feel any pain. Sensitive people may find that the stool is dark ocher, or even tar-like (black and shiny). At this time, the patient does not care at all and continues to work as usual. After a long time, a large amount of blood collapses, hematemesis, and melena occur at the same time, so that during work, fainting and falling to the ground, unconsciousness, cold hands and feet, cold sweat all over the body, frequent pulse, short breath, pale face, and decreased blood pressure. At this time, he began to panic and sent him to the hospital, and the patient had entered a critical condition. If he can escape the disaster, quick hemostasis can be saved, otherwise this will only be a last resort, and it is not something that can be rescued by hitting a stone.</p>
<p>(2) Perforation: Those suffering from gastric peptic ulcers may have this crisis of perforation at any time. After perforation, it enters peritonitis, resulting in death. Among those who die from peptic ulcers, about 65% or more are due to this serious perforation. Duodenal ulcer perforation is more common than gastrointestinal perforation. Patients with perforation often complain of sudden severe pain at the beginning, which continues, radiating from the upper abdomen to the back or shoulder. The degree and nature of the pain are different from the usual. The doctor often finds that the patient's expression is painful, his face is pale, his breathing is short, and the respiratory movement is limited to the chest. His limbs are cold, his body is stiff and cannot be moved slightly, and the abdominal wall is as hard as a board. Palpation often shows severe tenderness. One or two hours after the perforation, the face changes from white to red, the body temperature gradually rises, the limbs change from cold to warm, the abdomen gradually expands, the breathing becomes shorter, and the pulse becomes faster. At this time, he enters the reaction period and peritonitis occurs. If the patient delays the opportunity for several hours, is timid, and refuses to undergo repair surgery, most of them will die of peritonitis. Even the latest penicillin and plasma are useless. Those with simultaneous perforation and bleeding account for one-tenth, and their severity is naturally doubled.</p>
<p>Chronic Crisis</p>
<p>(1) Obstruction: Peptic ulcers mostly occur near the pylorus (that is, the main road from the stomach to the duodenum), or the pylorus is tightly closed due to muscle spasm, or obstruction occurs due to chronic inflammation, scarring, or tumor. Patients often complain of vomiting history. Pain in the upper stomach can only be relieved after vomiting. The vomitus is often large and contains food eaten several days ago. Moreover, diet is often reduced, nutrition is hindered, resulting in emaciation, haggardness, weakness, and anemia.</p>
<p>(2) Gastric Cancer: Duodenal ulcers mostly have no cancerous changes, but gastric ulcers are not the same. According to the autopsy results of pathologists, about 5% of gastric ulcers turn into gastric cancer. After getting gastric cancer, bleeding, pyloric obstruction, and metastatic cancer of the peritoneum and liver can occur, resulting in incurable. Moreover, the early symptoms are often not obvious, only indigestion, poor appetite, and sharp weight loss. When the patient finds out, it is often in a difficult-to-treat stage. The life of these patients is only one or two years. Even if early surgery can remove it, it usually cannot be extended to more than five years.</p>
<p>(3) Gourd-shaped Stomach: Chronic digestive gastric ulcers located in the middle of the upper green (lesser curvature) of the stomach can change the shape of the stomach into a gourd shape, which is called a gourd stomach. These patients often have a history of stomach disease for several years to decades. The upper abdomen is more swollen, and there is dull pain, followed by vomiting, indigestion, and loss of appetite. Bleeding, perforation, and obstruction can also occur.</p>
<p>(4) Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis can lead to peptic ulcers, and peptic ulcers can also be combined with chronic gastroenteritis. Patients often have poor appetite, digestion is suppressed, and there is a slight discomfort in the upper abdomen. In these patients, gastric acid is often lower and treatment is more difficult.</p>
<p>(5) Perigastritis: When a peptic ulcer progresses to ulceration and enters the muscle and peritoneal base layer before perforation, or its progress is extremely slow, it often stimulates the surrounding tissues of the stomach and intestines, causing chronic perigastritis. Therefore, the nature, degree, and location of the patient's stomach disease are different from the past. If it ulcerates into the outer layer of the pancreas, there is often dull pain in the lower right back. If the time is long, the consequences of inflammation are often adhesion, which makes surgical procedures more difficult.</p>
<p>(6) Gastrointestinal Fistula: If a peptic ulcer progresses to perigastritis, and then heals and adheres to the large intestine, and perforation occurs, a fistula is formed, and the large intestine directly communicates with the gastric cavity. If vomiting occurs, feces are often vomited out, and food, after swallowing, is not digested. It is discharged shallowly within a few hours. Therefore, the patient eats but does not digest, and cannot absorb anything, and feels a lack of nutrition. Anemia, edema, etc. follow, making surgical treatment difficult.</p>
<p>In summary, the scourge of peptic ulcers affects one person on a small scale and society on a large scale. Therefore, early diagnosis and reasonable treatment are essential. I hope ulcer patients seize the opportunity and do not delay themselves.</p>

<h3>The Question of Authenticity in Ancient Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>Briefly Discussing the Exhibits at the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages</p>
<p>This exhibition of calligraphy and painting through the ages, sponsored by the China Cultural Relics Company, provides an opportunity for the citizens of Shanghai to appreciate the art, and also presents a challenge for calligraphers and painters to test their knowledge.</p>
<p>In appreciating calligraphy and painting, the most difficult hurdle is distinguishing between genuine and fake. The difficulty in distinguishing between the two does not lie entirely in quality. Fake paintings are not necessarily bad paintings. Many fake paintings are made by famous masters. Genuine paintings are not necessarily good paintings. The careless and perfunctory work of a famous master is often mistaken for a fake by later generations. There are countless factors such as these. Therefore, connoisseurs must further examine the age of the paper and silk, and the color and size of the seals. For example, Weng Fanggang distinguished the authenticity of Zhao Ziang's works entirely based on a slight defect in the "zi" character at the top of the seal. But counterfeiters often make these details so convincing that one is completely convinced, so what can be done? Therefore, the qualifications of a connoisseur are: first, he is a scholar himself; second, he is a calligrapher and painter himself; third, he is particularly proficient in a certain school or era; fourth, he has suffered many losses in this field. His judgment relies not only on material evidence such as paper, silk, and seals, but also on his intuition and eyesight. This is what distinguishes a connoisseur from an antique dealer. However, even with good eyesight, it is still not entirely accurate, at most only seven or eight out of ten certain. Therefore, among all ancient artifacts, calligraphy and painting are the most difficult to identify. Even the most discerning connoisseur finds it difficult to make a definitive judgment. (Assuming he is truly sincere, humble, and capable) Generally speaking, good or bad is relatively easy to discern, but authenticity is more difficult to assert with certainty. Careful connoisseurs are mostly unwilling to lightly declare something as genuine or fake.</p>
<p>The above words are based on purely objective appreciation. In addition, the collection of ancient calligraphy and painting is always related to money. This involves extremely complex and subtle human relationships. Therefore, the issue of authenticity makes it even more difficult to speak openly. At a banquet, someone brought out a scroll of ancient painting. A certain elder, in a moment of pleasure, said it was fake. Later, the elder learned that the scroll was originally intended to be sold to raise travel expenses. Because of his words, the sale fell through. From then on, the elder regretted it and warned himself never to speak of truth and falsehood again.</p>
<p>There are many exhibits in this exhibition. I went to see it twice but didn't buy a catalog. I rushed through it and forgot everything when I got home. I remember some of the second time. Ouyang Wenzhong's letter is really good. There are not many calligraphy works in this exhibition. Wu Yuanbo's poem scroll is excellent. Zhou Tianqiu's running script is also wonderful, the turns and pauses showing the force of the brush. I remember it was on silk, which seemed to reveal the brushstrokes more easily. Wen Hengshan's vertical scroll is good, but not a masterpiece. Ma Xianglan's several love letters are truly a great treasure. The tenderness of her feelings is self-evident, and even her brushstrokes are elegant and flavorful. Some of the characters are not well-formed in structure (for example, the character "曾"), but they still have artistic appeal. The fine details of the strokes are very similar to those written with a "Parker 51" pen, but today's young ladies probably can't write such letters. That painting by Ju Ran, "Dense Forest and Layered Peaks," was recorded in the Bao Yu Ge collection. In my opinion, it is definitely an old painting. The four characters "Dense Forest and Layered Peaks" are said to be written by Mi Nan Gong, or Mi Hu Er. In any case, these four characters are not badly written. Dong Wenmin's small horizontal landscape scroll (small script with the inscription "Qichang," with a postscript by Yang Longyou) is truly a masterpiece! It makes people linger and not want to leave. Huang Heshan Qiao's "Summer Mountain Dwelling," a masterpiece! Two paintings by Ni Yunlin are excellent, and the paper is clean. Chen Laolian's large silk scroll "Teaching Scripture" is very wonderful. This shows that this master indeed put in effort into studying Tang paintings. The most strange thing is that large landscape scroll by Shi Tao. Why is it so highly valued? Let me boldly say it is fake. But if the principle of truth and falsehood being difficult to determine, as mentioned in the previous two paragraphs, can be established, then both sides who claim the painting is genuine or fake each bear half the responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more thing I want to say. Although this exhibition has been a great effort and has achieved good results, it cannot be called a complete success. Perhaps the efforts of the organizers are not enough, and one of the reasons should be that collectors are reluctant to exhibit their treasures. Many collectors did not bring out their most cherished pieces. Even with my limited knowledge, I can easily give an example. For example, Huang Heshan Qiao's "Qing Bian Retreat Map," I heard is in the collection of Mr. Wei Tingrong, why couldn't it be felt? This painting is inscribed by Dong Wenmin as "The Best Painting by Wang Shuming in the World," and also has Dong Gong's writing of Ni Yunlin's poem to Wang Meng on it. Besides the "Dai Zong Dense Snow Map" by Huang Heshan Qiao that was burned in the house of Yao Gong Sui (a Ming Dynasty person), there are few pieces as magnificent and famous as this. If everyone is allowed to admire it, it would be a contribution to culture and art, and it would also benefit the collector. Now the security in Shanghai is absolutely safe, and the person in charge is the authorities in terms of position, and a gentleman in terms of identity, so there is absolutely no fear of being taken by force. Perhaps they cherish it so much that they are reluctant to exhibit it at will to avoid damage. But this difficulty can be easily solved as long as good hands are carefully employed to do it. I hope that at the next exhibition, we viewers will have this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Postscript to Tian Jiweng's Long Scroll Painting of Mount Duqiao Landscapes</h3>
<p>— Xu Shaodi</p>
<p>Ji Weng's painting style derives from the methods of Song and Yuan masters. The landscapes and scenery he depicts possess the wonders of front and back, slant and side, gathering and scattering, near and far, inside and outside, solid and void, continuous and broken. Thus, they are endowed with complete spirit, having both form and momentum; they are unrestrained and expressive, free from the flaws of rigid and artificial carving. Ji once said: "Mountains and rivers are born from my mind, and I am born from mountains and rivers. Exhaustively search for strange peaks and use brushwork freely; mountains and rivers merge with me, leaving behind traces of transformation." You have mastered its essence. This painting is simple and ancient, with a majestic atmosphere. Within its vastness lies boldness, and its elegant beauty does not lose its strength. He brushes with ease, creating a realm of strange peaks and secluded paths. One can imagine that when he sees the form and captures the emotion, his brush possesses the power of a vajra. In the past, Zhang Dafeng viewed Mount Changping Tian'an Hall, and his painting skills improved. Qin Shunyou entered Datian, and his depictions of pine needles and stone veins were remarkably different. Ji Weng once roamed through Austria and Italy, extensively viewing the mountains and rivers of Guilin. I share the same sentiments in this painting.</p>
<h3>Zhang Daqian's Erotic Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Zhang Daqian, a native of Aozhou, grew a beard in his twenties, a long beard that reached past his belly, much like the "Beautiful Beard Duke" Guan Yu; he is now forty-four years old. He is romantic and uninhibited, and enjoys making humorous remarks when chatting with friends. Before the War of Resistance, he traveled to Korea and fell in love with a Korean woman named Chun Hong. Although they did not understand each other's language, they laughed together when they understood each other's feelings, which can be said to be a temporary romance in a foreign land. Daqian made a painting album as a souvenir. On the back of one painting, he drew a clothes rack with two newly washed red and white women's shirts hanging on it, and a woman squatting beside a chopping block, pausing her pestle and gazing intently, fully expressing her longing for someone far away. Daqian wrote a short poem:</p>
<p>"Joyful like washing red skirts,</p>
<p>Washing red becomes shallow day by day;</p>
<p>My heart is like washing plain silk,</p>
<p>Washing plain silk does not fade."</p>
<p>He also wrote a poem to Chun Hong:</p>
<p>"Iyi Cai's barbaric language is not yet mastered,</p>
<p>How can I express my lonely heart in a foreign land;</p>
<p>The most difficult thing is to guess the ordinary words,</p>
<p>But the meaning is conveyed through light brushstrokes."</p>
<p>Another poem for Chun Hong:</p>
<p>"Newly arrived, the language of the Upper Kingdom is still awkward,</p>
<p>Wanting to laugh and pretending to be shy is too simple;</p>
<p>A frown gathers between the corners of the eyebrows,</p>
<p>Suppressing the vulgar guests from disrupting the pure conversation."</p>
<p>Their affection was lingering and their hearts were full of emotion, vividly appearing before my eyes. I once asked him if Madam Ning Su knew about this affair. Daqian immediately took out a double portrait of himself and Chun Hong from the drawer, a painter and a beauty, complementing each other. Beside the photo, he wrote two poems for Madam Ning Su:</p>
<p>"Hesitating and afraid to send a letter, a picture of joy with foreign flowers and grass;</p>
<p>If not met with slight anger, you should laugh, I pity her even more, let alone an old servant.</p>
<p>Reluctantly bidding farewell to foolish children, written into the picture is not madness.</p>
<p>Wanting to ask Tian Sun for news, can the Milky Way allow a small star to be hidden?"</p>
<p>Ambition leaped between the lines, revealing the artist's humor.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Portrait of Lay Buddhist Anding</h3>
<p>— Xia Jinguan</p>
<p>Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, portrait painting has been roughly divided into two schools. Those who followed Zeng Bochun include Xie Wenhou, Shen Erdiao, Xu Xiangjiu, Zhang Yu Yuan, Zi Yuan Zi De Si, Yuan Zhonghui, Guo Wujiang, Xu Yaopu, Gu Lingcheng, and others. This school used the ancient to serve the present, forming its own style. They and Wan Shenzhai's line drawings, two styles of subtle halo and rouge, although not teachers, come from the same source. Those who followed Jiao Bingzhen include Leng Jichen, Cui Xiangzhou, Mang Zhuoran, Jin Jieyu, and others. Since the introduction of photography, most portrait painters have followed the Jiao school, and the ancient methods have disappeared.</p>
<p>Lay Buddhist Anding, Mr. Hu Yaguang, inherited the traditions of his maternal family, the Dai Wenjie. He loved collecting paintings and calligraphy, and then learned Western painting to study portraiture, taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses of the Zeng and Jiao schools, attempting to establish a new style. In the past, Zhu Zhuzha described the words of Zeng's disciples, saying: "Before obtaining it, it seems as if something is stuck in the heart and cannot be released; after obtaining it in the heart, it is like a flying bird passing the sun, its form leaving me faster and faster, and its spirit is more complete." Mr. Hu has probably understood this saying.</p>
<h3>Talking About Couplets</h3>
<p>— Shan Ding</p>
<p>Chinese art considers calligraphy to be the most beautiful, and couplets are the most beautiful form of calligraphy. Taking one or two lines from ancient poems, either describing scenery or expressing emotions, written in fine calligraphy, and hung in a room, speaking face to face, as if hearing their voices, as if meeting with ancient people, this is the most elegant way.</p>
<p>When writing couplets, you must not fold the paper into grids, otherwise it will be like setting type, and the spirit will be lost. But you also cannot not fold it, especially for seven-character couplets, which are often written with the first four characters being spacious, and the last three characters having almost no space. But you can fold the paper in the middle, and carefully consider it when you start writing. After writing the first four characters, fold it a little, then the next three characters will have enough space. If it is a five-character or eight-character couplet, it is easy to position, and there is no need to plan it.</p>
<p>When writing couplets, you must grind the ink thick and dip the brush fully. Hold a seven-inch brush three inches from the tip, loosen your clothes, suspend your wrist, and write freely. Fan Fanshan and Feng Menghua both wrote couplets while sitting, so their energy flowed.</p>
<p>When writing couplets, you need a long-tipped brush. Huang Shangu said that the brush tip should be three inches long, with two-thirds exposed and one inch inserted into the tube. I have tried to do this carefully, and it is easy to expose two inches, but difficult to insert one inch into the tube. Nowadays, a brush maker who can insert three-tenths of an inch is already a master. If the base of the brush is not strong, the strokes will not be strong. The next best thing is to use a large brush, which has plenty of reserve, which is more than half the battle.</p>
<p>When writing couplets, you must understand the method of storing ink, and the person who can write the entire couplet in one stroke is a master. The person who stops after four characters and fills in the remaining three is a skilled hand. The person who dips the brush after one or two characters is of inferior quality.</p>
<p>When writing couplets, you cannot use silkworm cocoon paper, which will lose its wax and be eroded by ink after a long time, becoming a blurry mess. You cannot use Sutra paper, which will become moldy and rotten after a long time, which is also unsightly. For gold paper and coral paper, you should first wipe it with a fine cloth, and you cannot wipe it with powder, which will make the ink color dull. Jade paper and tribute paper both cause the brush to stick, and raw Xuan paper is too absorbent. It seems that paper boiled in clean water is the most suitable. If it is old paper, then anything is suitable, so there is no need to choose.</p>
<p>It is most difficult to add an inscription to a couplet. The upper inscription should start between the second character, and the lower inscription is usually under the fourth character. It is best to inscribe with the original brush, without waiting for it to dry and using a different brush; otherwise, the spirit will be lost.</p>

<h3>Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi</h3>
<p>— Da Mu</p>
<p>In modern times, the two major painters in China are Wu Changshuo in the south and Qi Baishi in the north.</p>
<p>Wu Changshuo has been dead for more than ten years. The Japanese valued his paintings the most. His name was Ku Tie, and his alias was Canlu. He first sold paintings in Suzhou, and only came to Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China, living in a Tijingguan. At that time, not many people knew him. Later, he was introduced by Huang Binhong and signed a contract with the Japanese Mr. Luoshan to paint in Luoshan Garden. At the same time, Mr. Luoshan promoted him in the newspapers. From then on, his reputation grew. However, Wu had to give half of his earnings to Mr. Luoshan. Later, more and more people asked Wu to paint, and he ran out of sketches and couldn't cope. So he dipped paper in ink and modified it according to the shape of the ink, saying that it was a method that existed in ancient China, called "transformation." In addition to painting, Wu was also good at epigraphy, and the poems he inscribed on his paintings were especially vigorous and pleasing! For example, he wrote on narcissus flowers: "A flower blooms in the bitter cold weather, I read Li Sao and guess carefully, it seems like the strange and poor Meng Dongye, bowing his head, who will come to worship?" And for example, he wrote on maple trees: "Under a tree in the setting sun, I recite poetry and tie a boat, I haven't been to Wujiang for a long time, I recall past travels through paintings."</p>
<p>Qi Baishi is still alive and well, aged eighty-six, living in Beijing, still painting for people. He came from a very poor background, and was a carpenter in his childhood. Later, through his own efforts, he buried himself in learning to paint. In less than ten years, his painting fame shook the world, and high-ranking officials and nobles also sought his paintings. However, his temper was very strange. If he looked down on someone, he would not paint for him even if they offered a high price. Because of his noble character, more and more people sought his paintings, so his income from selling paintings over the decades is said to have made him wealthy. When the Japanese occupied Beiping a few years ago, they wanted him to paint, but he closed his door and would rather starve to death. The Japanese could do nothing about him, so they just smiled and left. He named his residence Jiping Tang. The year before last, I saw one of his poems: "A bleak wind blows on my sleeves, different from the human world, living here for so long, I have forgotten the cold in my heart and gallbladder, I am used to seeing horse-faced and bull-headed ghosts, Jiping Tang is outside the gates of hell." A feeling of resentment leaped onto the paper.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 66</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>While we were talking, we had already walked to the station exit. Looking back, we saw that those guys hadn't followed us, but were standing there whispering and starting a round table meeting. At this time, the car had already made the sound of starting the steam cylinder, and the green flag had already been waved. At this moment, I only saw the guy dressed as a businessman, saying what seemed to be the last sentence, waving his hand, and getting on the car.</p>
<p>"We've been tricked!" Brother Hu said urgently, "There's still time to get on the car, what do you think, Aunt?" His big round eyeballs were rolling around, flashing light, looking at the departing car, and then looking at the three police dogs staying at the edge of the car battle.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Brother Hu shouted at the police dogs, "What's up?"</p>
<p>The three police dogs, the one who got spit on, and the other two, carrying our things, pretended to walk over; but this momentum, compared with the fierce arrogance in the car, had already become a spent force. When they reached us, they didn't make a sound, and went straight out of the exit.</p>
<p>The station was just outside the station, a police station. The young stationmaster, seeing this group of us, widened his eyes, somewhat at a loss, and instead invited me and Brother Hu to sit down in the office like VIPs. This made me want to laugh.</p>
<p>The young stationmaster settled us down, and then asked the three guys what was going on. The one who got beaten pulled the stationmaster and walked outside, because there was only one room here. The four of them went out. Brother Hu wanted to hear what they were saying, but I advised him not to bother, because I knew what was going on.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in less than a few minutes, the young stationmaster had already turned around and came in, with a face of trepidation, and wearing a kind of awkward smile, as if he had a toothache. The two who robbed the package and briefcase followed behind like thieves, softly and lightly putting the things on the only long table, turning around and wanting to "be clear."</p>
<p>"Stop!" Brother Hu suddenly shouted, his voice was sharp and tender, but still had some dignity; because inside the sharp and tender voice, there was a force.</p>
<p>"Go, go," the young stationmaster turned cold and waved his hands repeatedly, "I'm here."</p>
<p>I also patted Hu's hand, meaning for him not to scare them. The two guys really looked like dogs with their tails between their legs, dragging their thoughts, and walked out.</p>
<p>"You two are going to the city?" the young stationmaster seemed to be talking to a superior, "This is really a big misunderstanding, ... but it delayed you two's car ... I have to do my best to find a way for you two, even if I call a car?"</p>
<p>"That's okay," I made up my mind to find out what was going on, "But there's one condition, otherwise, don't talk about a car, even if you send a float, send a plane, we still have to be willing to go!"</p>
<p>"I'll listen to you," the stationmaster showed that toothache smile again, "You are reasonable, I am an outsider, you know, I didn't participate in this situation ... Miss, what conditions do you have, just open it up, I will do my best to handle it..."</p>
<p>"What?" Brother Hu glared, "These bastards, didn't you let them go? What do you mean?"</p>

<h3>Jiang Gongmei</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Jiang Gongmei's two bullets ended his life at Song Gongyi. Jiang Gong's ending was really not beautiful.</p>
<p>Those who remember the grand occasion of Shanghai's recovery last year will not forget this great gendarmerie captain who dominated the world at that time. His majestic proclamation, his imposing manner when entering and leaving, his subordinates who managed everything, after only a year, the scene is completely different. Many people who were lucky enough to escape the net may still be at large, but their spirits are probably also filled with fear!</p>
<p>What people don't quite understand is that this case was only judged almost a year later. It was initially judged as not guilty, then changed to five and a half years in prison, and finally changed to the death penalty. The distance between the death penalty and not guilty is too great. Was it that more evidence of his crime was discovered during the trial that moved back and forth between Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing? Or was the initial investigation insufficient?</p>
<p>Jiang Gongmei deserved to die. If he had known today that a sports shirt and a pair of suit pants would lie in the wilderness, bleeding profusely, what use would those gold bars and cars and Western-style houses have been to him?</p>

<h3>"Public Opinion"</h3>
<p>— Xi Nu</p>
<p>Not long ago, a certain place held a public opinion survey to speak up for a major traitor, publishing the number of votes in favor of a suspended sentence, appearing as if it was the will of the people. In this age of great democracy, this masterpiece is like a Jewish-made American glass belt, temporarily able to confuse the real thing; but unfortunately, it was ultimately rejected, leaving behind only the appearance of a sheep's head with dog meat inside. Now it has been discovered that a certain place is holding a survey, asking people to choose one of the following three pre-determined answers: (1) I support American troops being stationed in China, the more the better; (2) I demand that American troops immediately withdraw from China; (3) I don't care, whether American troops are stationed in China or not, it is not related to me. As long as you are a Chinese national, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, you can participate and speak, hoping it will be as widespread as possible, readers can circulate it and solicit submissions, those who are illiterate can ask someone to write it for them, and so on. Let's think about it: I am a "Chinese national," so naturally I cannot ignore national affairs. However, this question is too clever. The first item may have a limited, time-sensitive approval, but the added tail "the more the better" is not what the people really think, so the first item can only be rejected. As for the third item, of course no one is willing to fill it in. So, with two roads blocked, only the second item is left, which is "I demand that American troops immediately withdraw from China." In this way, without waiting for the announcement, the second item will undoubtedly be the absolute winner, and it will completely match the secret documents of the × Party, which emphasize the bad deeds of American troops in China (such as military vehicle accidents, etc.) to arouse the people's resentment towards American troops and achieve the goal of withdrawing American troops from China. Once it is presented as "public opinion" (with votes as evidence), it will naturally be in accordance with the will of Heaven and the people, and legitimate.</p>
<p>We must shout to respect public opinion, because public opinion is the sacred call of the masses; but we cannot bear to see "public opinion" being borrowed, fooled, betrayed, desecrated, and utilized! The common people cannot follow other people's smelly tails and act as echo worms. We do not like to watch this clumsy trick.</p>
<p>If you must require it to be widespread, and you can circulate it and solicit submissions, although the writer is among the illiterate, this national grand strategy, is more than a blind person. Just as with electing senators, please ask the proctor of the current situation issue to take on the task of “writing” it all at once.</p>
<h3>Ji · Pu · Ming</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>The car doesn't have to be big, as long as it can drive. The loss doesn't have to be crude, as long as it's quick. This is a "Jeep," and only I can enter. Driving without fear of obstruction, hitting people can lead to the underworld. Talking and laughing with women, no ignorant people come and go. It can show off, and be neurotic. Without the noise of military police, without the annoyance of police officers. Ghost tanks, Nazi submarines. Passers-by say: What "Ji" is there?</p>
<h3>Word Prediction</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Mr. So-and-So, is thirty-five years old this year, born on October 10th. Every year on this day, relatives and friends always want to celebrate for him. Although he accepts their good intentions on the surface, he cannot help but feel depressed because he sees his family business declining day by day and everything going wrong. So after his birthday this year, he went to consult a word prediction master to predict his fortune for the year and ask about good and bad luck.</p>
<p>The word prediction master used the "double prediction method," which requires you to write two words in a row and then split them apart together. My friend, moved by the scene, wrote two "ten" characters on the water board. The word prediction master asked about his intentions, pondered for a moment, and said: "Don't be offended by my straightforward words, judging from the meaning of the characters, 'ten' is the total number, which is also the meaning of full; in other words, fullness leads to loss. Now that two fullness are added together, there is bound to be loss. Perhaps in the past or in a previous life, you may have been in the limelight, but now it may be difficult to be satisfied!"</p>
<p>"In terms of form, 'ten' is a cross, which is a symbol used by Christians to express mourning; it is also the symbol of a hospital; it is also the badge of the Crusaders; all of these are unlucky things. According to this reasoning, the big issue is that frequent casualties, or lingering diseases, or unresolved lawsuits year after year, which will lead to the danger of losing everything!"</p>
<p>"If the position of the cross is skewed, it becomes an '×'. × is a symbol of incorrectness, and there are two ×s in a row, which clearly shows that there are many incorrect things in your way of life, and you still need to improve a lot!"</p>
<p>The word prediction master saw that my friend was silent, and determined that his words had hit the mark; the rest was just him talking off the top of his head, pouring out a thousand miles, but he also earnestly encouraged and advised him:</p>
<p>"This × character, in the commercial field, is also the representative of four, ×× is forty-four, then you must wait until 443 years before you have the hope of turning bad luck into good luck; but now from thirty-five to forty-four, it will take ten years. In these ten years, you must bury your head and work hard, and strive to produce; this is the meaning of ten years of gathering, which is to cultivate vitality and restore vitality, as a basis for future development, then the future is unlimited. That's all I have to say, please forgive my straightforwardness."</p>
<h3>If I Were a City Councilor</h3>
<p>— Luo Bao</p>
<p>If I were a city councilor, I would definitely come up with a win-win solution to the Shanghai Municipal Government's financial difficulties, so that the Municipal Government would not be unable to make ends meet, and at the same time, the city's prosperity would not be affected.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested restoring lotteries, but more people oppose it, so this method cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>In the past, when the "Public Works Bureau" was in deficit, someone suggested issuing municipal lottery tickets - imitating the previous "Aviation Lottery" and "Charity Lottery" methods, and using the surplus funds as expenses for the Public Works Bureau. However, it was not implemented later. I think that this proposal will probably not be approved at present.</p>
<p>Then, in order to balance municipal revenue and expenditure, is there only one way to increase the burden on the people - increase various taxes? (Cutting redundant staff has little effect, and is not a fundamental solution)</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a citizen, do you support the entertainment tax being increased again and again? Do you agree that property tax, police tax, business tax... are rising step by step?</p>
<p>If I were a councilor, I would definitely advocate hiring the city's soccer and basketball masters as staff members of the Municipal Government and its affiliated institutions. In their spare time, they would hold matches once or several times a week, sell tickets to the public, and use the income as much as possible to supplement municipal expenses.</p>
<p>This is promoting sports, not gambling. Who would dare to object? Whoever objects is "undermining sports." What do you think of this method?</p>
<h3>Changeability</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>The Jiang Gongmei embezzlement case went from being acquitted to being sentenced to five and a half years in prison, and then suddenly sentenced to death, which was carried out on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>No one feels sorry for Jiang Gongmei's death. However, the repeated changes in the judgment of this case are perplexing. Is it possible to arbitrarily sentence someone before the entire case is fully understood?</p>
<p>Not long ago, I read in the newspaper that the investigation team in Guangzhou discovered a shocking "concealed gold case." After taking it out on September 23rd and counting the quantity, there were twenty-three gold bricks, each weighing about fifty catties. After testing, it was proved that it contained 61% gold. The location where the gold was hidden was the property of the traitor Zhang Rongsun, which had already been sealed and taken over.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, the above-mentioned gold bricks were publicly tested at the Central Bank of Guangzhou. Professor Zheng Shumin of Zhongshan University used scientific methods for the testing. The result was that it only contained copper and zinc. The gold bricks became scrap copper, and the investigation team came up empty.</p>
<p>Regarding the above two cases, it is not appropriate to make reckless comments before obtaining the full truth. It seems we can only sigh, "Changeability!" That's all.</p>
<h3>Advocating Eating Grass</h3>
<p>— Xu Rong</p>
<p>In the past, the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, abandoned his palace and ran to the pasture to eat grass with the cattle and horses. Therefore, many people pitied him, thinking he was a madman with a nervous breakdown. But he was not a madman after all. If he were eating grass in the spring, when the grass was sprouting, very tender and fresh, then the grass he ate would contain 40% protein, its nutritional value would be comparable to steak, and soybeans would obviously be far less nutritious than grass. Moreover, he could absorb a large amount of various vitamins from the grass.</p>
<p>Mr. Snabel, a representative of a food research company in Kansas, USA, recently participated in a meeting of the American Chemical Society and strongly praised the high nutritional value of grass. According to this gentleman's research, young and fresh grass contains more protein when it is first cut than when it is harvested later when it is mature. Its nutritional value is no less than that of meat and milk; however, the protein contained in grass is of better quality. The protein contained in good quality grass is much stronger than milk in terms of nutritional value.</p>
<p>This gentleman also wonders why farmers wait so long to cut the grass. If the grass is cut in the usual way, it will have lost most of its nutritional value. After being slowly dried, it will lose even more vitamins. His conclusion is: cutting the grass early and quickly drying it is the only way to preserve the high nutritional value in the grass.</p>
<p>Friends who study vitamins and refugees who are accustomed to eating Guanyin clay may wish to change their tastes and advocate eating grass, which can fill their stomachs, prolong life, and increase longevity!</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Wang Wu</p>
<p>Chinese people love old things: aged Taidiao wine, Shaoxing thirty-year-old wine, old mountain ginseng, old brands... and so on. Literati use names such as "studio owner," "mountain man," and "lay Buddhist"... which is very much like relying on age to support oneself. In name, we can ignore it; in the present world, we should pursue the essence. If it is truly "old but vigorous," we should respect the elderly. But it is unnecessary to be precocious. If there are still "masters" in a democratic era, that is truly "old but not dead!"</p>
<p>I once observed a child's sleeping posture: mouth and eyes closed, with a slight smile, truly the most beautiful! But an adult over forty, still sleeps with his mouth open, or with his eyes half-open, his face frightening, which is another feeling.</p>
<p>Unaware that old age is approaching, we should work hard as soon as possible!</p>
<p>"If it fades, guaranteed refund and exchange,"</p>
<p>"Replace ten for every one broken,"</p>
<p>"Regardless of sacrificing capital, completely pleasing customers,"</p>
<p>This is the way of business. Shanghai merchants can recite them fluently. But their value is not as good as "try it on the spot to see if it works," which is relatively more decent.</p>

<h3>Accusation of Soviet Communist Party Member "Kravchenko"—A Brief History</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>(Editor: Mr. K's recent remarks accusing Stalin have been widely reported in domestic and foreign newspapers.)</p>
<p>In terms of his experience and behavior, Victor Kravchenko is indeed a noteworthy figure: he is a Soviet citizen, a Communist Party member, and a former senior official in the Soviet government. He is forty-one years old this year, and has been living in his country. In 1944, he was sent to the United States on official business, and suddenly announced in the United States that he was leaving the Soviet Communist Party. Recently, he went to the United Kingdom and wrote articles in the London newspaper "World News," accusing Stalin of actively preparing for war, and presented the Soviet Union's diplomatic and domestic policies as evidence. Kravchenko's words and actions have undoubtedly attracted international attention.</p>
<p>Joined the Communist Party Early</p>
<p>Victor Kravchenko was born in 1905 in Yekaterinoslav, Ukraine, Russia. His father was a revolutionary at the time, so he was influenced by revolutionary ideas from an early age. At that time, during the Tsarist regime, the royalists and revolutionaries formed two factions in armed and ideological opposition. Soon, the Russian Revolution of 1917 came, and he witnessed the chaotic civil war between the White Russians and the Red Russians. When Stalin announced the complete elimination of domestic rebel forces in 1929, Kravchenko tried every means to be allowed to join the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Mr. K was originally an industrial arts scholar. He was good at metallurgy, and at the same time, he was very enthusiastic in promoting party affairs. Therefore, he was once regarded by the people of the country as a rising star in the Soviet industrial arts field, and was loved and respected.</p>
<p>Doubts about Soviet Policy</p>
<p>However, after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union promulgated the decrees of "abolishing private land ownership" and "nationalizing industry," which caused serious agricultural production problems and resulted in famine. Mr. K began to have doubts about the Soviet Union's political policies, but like other tens of thousands of Soviet people (according to Mr. K himself), he could only keep all his doubts in his heart. When World War II broke out, he was assigned to be the captain of the engineering team of the Red Army, and later transferred to serve in the People's Committee. On April 4, 1944, he was dispatched to the United States by the Soviet Purchasing Committee to negotiate the purchase of goods. He took this opportunity to escape from the tiger's mouth and issued a statement in the United States announcing his departure from the Soviet Communist Party. This shocking behavior immediately made Kravchenko a figure valued by the American press. His every move, even half a word, was published on the front pages of American newspapers.</p>
<p>I Chose Freedom</p>
<p>After staying in the United States, Mr. K devoted himself to writing. At the beginning of this year, he completed his first book, "I Chose Freedom," which faithfully narrates his personal political career and private life, and reveals a lot about the true situation of rural life in the Soviet Union. It is a valuable source of information. If you want to understand Kravchenko's character and political views, you may wish to read it, and it can also help you understand the actual situation in the Soviet Union, because this book is a faithful report from a Soviet Communist Party member who grew up in the Soviet Union for thirty-nine years and witnessed it firsthand.</p>
