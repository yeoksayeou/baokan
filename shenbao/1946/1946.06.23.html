<h3>馬帥昨謁主席長談　三人會議正式開始　恢復交通問題可獲協議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕馬歇爾特使於今晨九時晋謁蔣主席，商談約一小時半始返行館，旋出席軍事三人小組會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕主宰今後八日和平女神與凶惡戰神最後命運之軍事三人小組會議，今晨十一時於寗海路五號馬使行館鄭重舉行。參加者政府代表為徐永昌·兪大維·郭汝槐，中共代表為周恩來·滕代遠·黃逸峯·童努生，美方代表為馬歇爾將軍·柯義上校等，由馬帥主席，商談兩小時，至一時始散。會議內容相約不對外發表，唯據有關人士吿記者：政府與中共雙方對於停戰及恢復交通兩問題，由於政府一再讓步，即可成立協議，唯因整軍方案中之整軍比例，及共軍駐區問題，迄未獲致協議，故簽字尙有待。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據悉：今日軍事三人小組會議中，對於恢復交通事，雙方已同意，對於津浦隴海平漢三鐵路首先修復及部份拆除沿鐵路綫之碉堡。據此間透露消息，實為雙方互讓之良好表現，亦為軍事三人小組會議可獲有良好後果之前奏。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕關於最後決定權，中共方面堅持給予美方代表較大之調處執行權，亦即不同意政府所提之多數決定權。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕今下午三時至六時，周恩來往見馬歇爾，廣泛交換除規定商談問題以外一般問題。六時，周氏返梅園新村，六時半邵力子驅車至，與周恩來談半小時，七時辭出。據邵氏語記者：彼此行乃代表政府方面對中共代表昨日所致政府代表一信，作口頭答覆。邵氏等初認中共此函係在主席發表延長休戰明令發出以前所決定者，現經中共方面稱，確係事先所決定者。據邵氏稱，該函中所提四項，前三項可望於此八天內獲得解決，第四點亦不必再談，因政協早有商決，目前僅待付諸實施而已。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二十二日電〕周恩來今日下午與馬歇爾特使會談二小時半，所談問題不在軍事三人小組委員會議程之內。馬使於今日三人小組會議後數小時，曾往晤蔣主席。此間觀察家相信馬使旣多次不經過政府代表而親與主席會晤，或可獲得一較速之解決辦法。三人小組將於明晨十時舉行第一次會議，同時，中共辦事處發言人稱：中共同意民主同盟之主張，即軍人不參加政治。</p>
<h3>中共題目越出軌空　顯又施拖延慣技　彭部長縱論共方建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕中宣部彭部長，於今日下午六時，招待記者對昨日共黨代表團上主席函中之四點，有所批評，尤於其第四點中所謂「改組政府，保障人權，解救民生，完成統一」過於空泛。彭部長稱：解救民生一項，共黨如搬出馬克斯資本論，即談上十年，恐亦未必有結果，共黨題目越出越空、顯然又施拖延慣技，目前最重要者，厥惟整軍問題，整軍協定成立，則其他問題亦迎刃而解，否則雖已簽字之任何協定，皆難奏效，譬如恢復交通問題，就過去所得經騐，共軍佔據鐵路沿綫，雖經修復，但仍遭破壞，若整軍問題解決，共軍駐地規定，則衝突自然可以避免。現共黨要求先長期停戰。再行商談，則勢成無限期協商，故政府不能同意，若共黨有誠意談判，則八天時日已非短期，足够談判，反顧五月來之協商，共軍利用停戰機會，不斷進攻察哈爾，攻佔長春，攻佔哈爾濱，前車可鑒，令人實不寒而慄，政府為避免共黨拖延政策，故必須定一期限，俾迅速能獲得永久和平之具體辦法。</p>
<h3>第三方面代表　昨與中共商談</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕靑年黨·民主同盟·社會賢達三方面代表傅斯年·莫德惠·曾琦·陳啓天·沈鈞儒·張申府等，廿二日下午三時，假中央硏究院約請中共代表商談。董必武·鄧穎超·李維漢出席報吿速日談判情形，並說明中共方面之態度。三方面代表未發表其體意見，惟僉望商談前途能有結果，定廿四日下午四時假國民大會堂再度邀請政府代表，報吿商談經過。</p>
<h3>董彥平返抵滬　日內晋京報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我駐蘇軍事代表團團長董彥平，偕團負邱楠，朱新民等，於昨日（二十二日）由海參崴返抵上海，日內擬晋京報吿一切。</p>
<h3>魏道明昨日謁陵</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕我駐美大使魏道明，於今晨十時赴總理陵謁陵。陵園管理委員會警衛處長馬湘親至禮堂招待，禮畢後復至陵谷寺遊覽至十一時始返城。</p>
<h3>柯克今飛珍珠港</h3>
<p>〔合衆社靑島廿一日電〕柯克海軍上將今日飛往珍珠港與杜維斯海軍上將會商。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕首都外勤記者聯誼會，為港政府無理停刋國民日報事，今通電全國同業，一致聲援。</p>
<h3>滬新聞記者團　過徐轉京返滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿二日電〕滬新聞記者團，廿一日由鄭搭隴海路快車於下午七時五十分抵徐，當夜換乘津浦快車赴京，約廿四日可抵滬。</p>
<h3>停戰展期令頒到　平津人心感輕鬆</h3>
<p>各報社論均希望雙方忍讓</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕廿二日午後，北平霖雨沛降，傍晚，雨過天靑，故都異於往年之酷暑，與半月來人民之焦灼心情，已隨此霖雨停戰展期令之頒降，倍感輕鬆淸爽。二日前，北平例有重要軍事會議召集，周至柔·孫迎仲，劉多荃，趙家驤，似皆曾參加，但其沈重感已被停戰展期令所冲淡。邇來受時局刺激之金價，二十日晚曾昇至二十萬九千元，昨晚停戰展期令傳出後，即陡降為二十萬三千元，今日金價最低價格已達二十萬二千元，而低萎之股票，則已力爭上游，一般心情，咸盼兩日內和平談商能獲結果。今日華北日報社論，以「十五天後再來一個八天」為題，贊同繼續和平協商，但不得無期延期，並指出協商應非空談，必須解決問題。世界日報社論，以「再看這八天」為題，呼籲不要使這八天的光陰和過去一樣輕輕過去，並認為縱然各項問題雙方意見尙有相當距離，但如有誠意，能忍讓，也不過一轉念之間，糾紛立可解決。益世報以「欣聞停戰令延長八天」為題，也認為談商的基點，在於誠意，公斷不公斷，倒是無可無不可，有誠意可不勞馬帥公斷，無誠意或誠意不够，恐怕馬帥之公斷亦將陷於　境，最後並呼籲「萬一八天之內仍談不好，切勿閉上和平之門。」新民報以「延長談判先健全心理」為題，大意說：（一）希望共軍對山東·山西兩地的攻勢，作一結束；（二）希望中央若認為共產黨果然武力可以解決，那就乾脆放手作去，若是政府還沒有消滅共軍的可能，不如乾脆不打。另一報以「最後關頭」作短評，呼籲各方以國家民族為重，切勿使辛苦得來的勝利，付之流水，則千秋萬世子孫將永感諸公之恩德。天津民國日報以「莫失良機」、為題，希望在國際友人協助下，將僵局迅速打開。關於第三者權限，國際上久有成例，只為解決問題，並無損於獨立國家獨立的體統。天津益世報以「對大局的一種看法」為題，指出國際環境，經濟破產，政治鬆弛，民心向背，再不宜於內戰，最後提出戰無益，和為貴。</p>

<p>〔中央社太原廿一日電〕同蒲綫交通好轉，臨汾至平遙尙無破壞情事，北段破壞處及南段平遙張蘭間，廿一日均已修復，太原南行章已直通臨汾，北行車直通原平，惟大牛店以北，情况尙不明。</p>
<h3>東北小嘴調處工作　有效期限亦延長　傳趙家驤將任遼甯主席</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕軍調部負責人稱：前在南京議決之在東北停戰期間，執行小組調處工作有效期限，隨停戰期限之延長而延長。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕東北局勢未臻穩定，傳將有多數武將，步梁華盛後而担任各方行政首長。東北來平高級人員盛傳東北保安長官部參謀長趙家驤，將出任遼寗主席，五十二軍軍長趙公武，則將出任遼北主席、</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕今為東北停戰延長八天之第一天，葉劍英今以頗為認眞之態度吿記者，無論如何，應於此八天中，扭轉大局，人民已不堪戰爭，絕不能再打了，軍調部正為此而作最大努力，減少和平談判之阻力，葉氏表示具有絕對信心。</p>

<h3>「期不過三」這次延長廳戰令　該是最后一次了</h3>
<p>— 房滄浪</p>
<p>本館駐京特派員</p>
<p>民國三十五年六月廿一日下午兩點鐘，正是驕陽當空，火傘高張，熱得令人發昏的時候中宣部長彭學沛公布了延長停戰限期到六月三十日中午十二時為止的一個好消息，即時並宣讀了國府主席命令前方部隊繼續停止前進，及追擊的明令。這一個消息公布以後，在塲的數十位中外記者，都不禁悲喜交集，輕輕的呼了一口氣。喜的是停戰限期延長，和平仍有一綫希望我們不須馬上再來報道那些令人鼻酸的消息；悲的是經騐吿訴了我們，邊談邊打的作風，如果不改，那是不會談出什麽好新聞來的，事實也吿訴了我們，可憐的老百姓實在拖不下去了，而且中國有句「期不過三」的成語，也値得我們更加戒愼，更加恐懼，因為過去在一月十日，六月六日，已經下過兩次停戰命令了，這一回是第三次，這該是最後一次。大家須記住，這一次是在六底滿期，是銀行決算的日子，是商家結賬的日子。請算算在過去半年中，為了談不妥而浪費的金錢，精力，和老百姓的血汗，該是幾何？老百姓為了和平，已經付出極大的代價了，不能再浪費了。　整軍第一國家至上，休戰延期不過八天，目前國共雙方的和平談判，急須解決的三項重大問題，如東北停戰，恢復交通，整編統編軍隊，這一個問題不到合理合法的解決，已經談出的辦法，像長春前進分部之成立，執行小組權力之加强，拆除碉堡，統一路政，路營，管理權等等，都會因盤據潛伏在各戰略地帶的軍力，和陸海交通綫上的軍力，隨時加以阻擾與破壞，這不是民主政府之下應有的顧慮和障礙，這不是希望長治久安的老百姓所願加以同意的一回事，所以政府主張在軍事三人會議中，首先整軍，老百姓莫不熱烈擁護，現在中共代表對於政府所提的整軍方案，在東北方面不願退出哈爾濱和安東，在關內則不願撤離熱察兩省及烟台威海衛，以及六月七日以後佔領的地方，理由是深恐政府將共軍驅至偏僻地區而加以消滅，中共代表昨日且公開發表了這一個消息後，人們都覺得很奇怪，因為在整軍實行的時候，中共就要加入政府指揮全國的國防軍了，何必要作如此危險的打算，何以還存着這樣落伍的看法哩！現在中國老百姓要求於各黨派的，是國家至上，不是軍事至上，中共應該反省，中共以外的人士也要努力設法，拿出更好的辦法和說法來帮助中共消除這一種不合民主要求的疑懼心理，來完成整軍的工作。</p>
<p>中國如不能迅速整軍裁兵，多拖一天，依據非正式的統計，每一個老百姓每天至少要負擔軍費及其他損失五百元，這是一種無比的損失，這是一種瀕於毀滅邊緣的驚人損失。整個蘇北不過一千數百萬人口，可是為了吃不消中共的　爭和敎育，就陸續逃出了三百多萬，最近連自耕農佃戶小店員都逃出來了，可憐逃出來的大多是忠厚而又貧窮的低能者，因此逃出了地獄，就成了餓鬼，不久有幾位一百個不相信的外籍記者，親自跑到鎭江去實地調査，結果不但掏腰包做了好事，而且還作了一次真正的民主攷騐，因為他們明白了中共佔領的「民主區」內是絕對沒有反對派的意見，這是民主嗎？阿門！（六月廿二日寄自南京）</p>

<h3>恢復東北煤礦生產　鮑萊向麥帥提建議　移用日一部分發電設備</h3>

<h3>社論　和平應從泯除疑忌始！</h3>
<p>和平！和平！全人類都在渴求和平，可是全世界都在擔憂和平之難保。此固不獨中國為然，而中國人則希望和平至切，尋求和平亦最力。中國人若不誠意正心的祈求和平，他們為什麽願於戰勝之際，接受美國的勸吿，和蘇聯訂立中蘇同盟友好條約？就憑這一點，就可判斷中國朝野上下不惜任何犧牲，爭取中蘇的友好，消除中蘇或甚而至於美蘇間在遠東可能引起疑忌的癥結，無非想為遠東和平乃至世界和平打好基礎。中國的國民政府，肯用這種自我犧牲的精神去奠定遠東和平的基礎，豈有不願極度忍讓來尋求國內和平之理？故在今天的中國，呼籲和平，老實說，大可不必向國民政府說話，當局的希望和平比我們更切。推什麽代表，罷什麼課，這種無聊的舉動，實在是多餘的。果眞要和平實現，乃至確保和平，我們先得懇求中國共產黨泯除他們疑忌的成見！</p>
<p>共產黨是一個革命政黨，不是一個民主政黨，故在它的成長期，就是從疑忌中訓練出來的。它處處防人家對付，時時防人家暗算，因而它的黨員常常不肯輕易信人。惟其如此，他們也就常常可以背信。在共產黨黨員的心目中，似乎根本沒有相信過人與人之間可以有互信這回事。至於國與國之間，他們以為「信」更沒有把握。「講信修睦」，本來是聯帶的；惟其不習慣於「講信」，於是述「修睦」也十分困難了。此又小獨中國共產黨為然，大凡天下的共產黨都不免有些疑忌的習性。今天我們要世界和平，要中國和平，最基本的入手方法，恐怕還是先要設法使共產黨的、「同志們」恢復起人類的信心來，消弭他們習憤成自然的疑忌。在這一點上，凡站在與共產黨相對地位的黨或國家，應該有所努力的。孟子說過：「愛人不親反其誠。」我們還是要推求為什麼不能泯除共產黨的疑忌。</p>
<p>譬如拿國際問題來說罷，原子彈」這件武器，多少是促使蘇聯格外疑忌的原因之一。美國當局深知道這一點，故特於聯合國原子能委員會開幕後，由其代表巴魯樞提出非常重要的建議，主張將原子能交國際機構管制，並聲明國際原子能機構如能成立，願將所有原子炸彈交出銷毀，不再製造。同時，美國又先後建議美英蘇法四國訂立廿五年防德同盟，美中蘇英訂立廿五年防日同盟。此在美國，實在可以算得竭盡心智，想給蘇聯以集體安全的保障，消除蘇聯對於世界其他强國的疑忌了。國際間的陰霾應可望其消散。但蘇聯代表葛羅米柯則另有建議，主張採用國際協定的方法，禁止原子武器的製造與使用，並要求美國在國際原子能管制機構成立後三個月內，先將現在所有儲藏的原子武器一律銷毀。可見蘇聯當局的疑忌還是沒有消釋，這眞可惜！美國代表巴魯樞曾說過這樣一句動人聽聞的話：「世界和平抑或世界毀滅，將視本會開會結果如何而定。」這個為世界安危所繫的原子能問題，依然、成為蘇聯疑忌的核心問題。</p>
<p>實在說，今日世界大局，蘇聯之所以惴惴不安，而要斤斤於「安全地帶」的擴充，不能不說她在心理上受到原子能的威脅所致。反之，英美之所以堅决反對蘇聯於國際管理原子能事保留否決權，而不願驟然公開原子能秘密，更不能不說是蘇聯在外交上屢採不妥協態度，有以致之。蘇聯在倫敦聯合國大會，紐約安全理事會，巴黎四國外長會議席上，處處不妥協，在蘇聯或許以為她不便輕易信任英美；而在英美看來，這適足以表示蘇聯之難以信任。如此互相疑忌，合作自然頗多荆棘。所以，如何泯除强國間的疑忌，是世界和平的先决條件。因為强國間有互信，不打仗，斷無小國弱國反願挑釁打仗的道理。</p>
<p>觀中國大局，我們也要求談判的雙方必須破除疑忌，尤其希望政府要盡力設法消弭共黨疑忌的心理。我們相信政府是正在那裏向這條路走，但我們願望共產黨也向這條路走。</p>
<p>國民政府為了與共黨談判，共黨不易相信，乃邀約其他黨派，及無黨無派的「第三者」，共同談判。應該共黨可以信赖了吧？然而，不！於是政府沒有法子，也顧不得國家體面，只好請了美國朋友來調處，而且得到共黨的同意。馬歇爾特使的來華，杜魯門總統的聲明，應該可以使中共相信美國盟友總可講一句公道話吧？然而，今天似乎又回答了一個「不」字！美國的宗旨，只希望中國能成功一個民主統一强大的中國，她並不偏愛中國的那一黨。馬歇爾特使的方案，只是要做到使共軍也統編在國家軍隊之內，而同時使共產黨以及其他黨派人士能眞誠的參加政府，共圖治理。這些都是共產黨應有的願望。縱說國民黨或許要欺共產黨，國民政府或許要壓迫共軍，但現在政府旣强調着願尊重馬歇爾特使的公斷，又願在商談時服從「多數取决」，那末祗要馬帥同意共黨的提議，政府就有任何犧牲亦在所不避的了。政府這樣求取和平，應該算有誠意了吧，為什麼還不能得共黨的諒解，來接受馬帥與美國盟友的公斷呢？中共的「同志們」，如果時至今日，還不能泯除疑忌，不肯推心置腹，開誠布公的來協商，則我們儘管喊和平，「和平」在中國將是很渺茫的了。我們為國家，為人民，為祖宗，為子孫，十三萬分的懇求中共不要再疑忌，庶幾「和平」之花，在中國可以開得燦爛奪目。</p>

<h3>四國共管日本建議　中英接受蘇未答覆　監視日本澈底解除軍備　締互助條約廿五年為期</h3>
<p>〔國新聞處華盛頓二十一日電〕。美國務院頃發表所擬中·美·英·蘇·解除日本武裝廿五年條約，其性質與四月廿九日國務卿貝爾納斯在第一次外長會議所發表之解除德國武裝條約相同，草的業經送達中英蘇三國政府，據國務院發言人稱：中英方面巳有滿意答覆，但蘇聯方面尙未答覆一字。</p>
<p>草約內稱：世界如一日需要和平與安全，則必須實行完全解除日本之武裝。關於此點，現尙未有保證，但祗有在此種保證之下，亞洲及世界各國始能安心恢復其和平之習慣。草約規定完全撤消日本之軍事機構，軍事配備，及製軍火之工具，並提議成立四國管理委員會，從事日本各地之視察，以便保證條約之嚴格施行。各有賊國家須於簽約後六側月內，就被此互助性質方面，擬定詳細辦法。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕外交部發言人稱：美國建議訂立四國條約，監視日本廿五年，英國在原則上甚為歡迎。英國之獲悉該約草案，為時即在獲悉四强制止德國草約之時，英官方自貝文外相以次，莫不表示贊助。英國對於該約之細則方面，尙有若干意見提出，聞已電知華盛頓。關於此事之商談尙少進展，故華盛頓於昨日即行宣布，不免便英國感覺驚異。</p>

<h3>呼籲和平完成統一　上海八十萬工人組織　反對內亂大同盟</h3>
<p>今晨起發動全市擴大宣傳　工教兩界否認派林漢達等晋京</p>
<p>上海巿總工會，昨日下午三時，假寗波同鄕會召集各榮工會理監事，舉行勞工座談會，即席決議組織上海巿工人反對內亂大同盟，呼籲制止內亂，要求和平，完成統一，並通過上蔣主席電及吿工友書曁臨時動議案多件。</p>
<p>昨日到會者，有上海市總工會，上海郵務電話，自來水，水電，棉紡，淸潔，造船，機器等一百八十單位三百餘人。中央常委潘公展，社會部陸司長，社會局長吳局長等均蒞臨指導。由周學湘，葉翔騤，范才睽，水祥雲，方如升五人為主席團。首由主席周學湘報告謂：今日總工會召集各工會同志開第五次座談會，討論中心，因最近國事嚴重，昨日全市學生已有反對內亂之示威行動，我們要安居樂業，統一和平，必須步驟一致，全市八十萬工人，要有組織，走在正軌上，為全國四萬萬同胞一致企求之反對內亂而奮鬥，對於此次內亂之發生，工界同胞多有不明瞭其經過者，茲請吳局長陸司長等予吾人以指導</p>
<p>防止一切非法活動</p>
<p>陸司長京士謂：最近大家均感覺不安定，這不安定是政治因素造成的，八年抗戰，已民窮財盡，而繼之共黨割据，發生內亂陷人民於水火之中，今主席已給共黨最後機會，將停戰令展至月底，希望共黨能顧全大局，於期滿前得和平解決，接受協議。本人近方自鎭江返滬，目睹耳聞，蘇北逃來難民所述「解放區」內之種種痛苦，共黨所喊漂亮口號，都是欺騙，各工會領袖要警覺不要受騙，我們要安定社會秩序，鎭靜防止一切非法活動。</p>
<p>研究不和平的因子</p>
<p>潘公展氏謂：大家要爭取和平，全國全世界人類都希望和平，和平是常態，內亂戰爭是病態，有病則必須治好，醫的方法，如何醫法，則要看請的醫生用的藥方，中國政府當局誠心誠意，要和平，去年勝利後，為求中蘇友好，同時使蘇美友好，乃與蘇聯簽訂友好條約，承認內蒙投票獨立，中長路共同經營，苦心以求世界之和平，國民黨政府要為國家民族以及全世界人類負責任，對國外如此，對內會不有誠意求和平嗎？我們要對政府有信心，交付全權來處理此事，我們要硏究不和平的因子在何處，明明白白在共黨，故我們要呼籲和平，要求和平，是要向共產黨要求的。再次，共產黨是國際的黨，中共决定權不在毛澤東周恩來，根本不在中國人手裏，我們不論在朝黨在野黨，須要實實在在中國人的黨，我們要表現人民希望的和平，向不和平方面喊出來。再看蘇省隔一長江，而成兩個天下，蘇北人民一天天向蘇南逃，蘇北民主嗎？八年抗戰靠主席領導，沒有走錯路，和全國一致團結，我們始能打勝仗，在此國家民族千載一時的復興機會，一部份人忘了中國人，不受領導，划據大地，破壞此千載一時的好機會「反對內戰一，就是醫好這病的要點。我們要相信醫生，可使中國致於死命的中日戰爭，因主席下的藥方對，亦得以起死回生；和平的目的，是要永久和平，病要好，吃藥打針後，能退熱消炎，是叨天之福，如熱不退，炎不消，要開刀動手術，亦只得開刀動手術。總之反對內亂是大家共同的要求，如何制止，我們不能作决定，但不能拖，拖則大家拖死完結。</p>
<p>千萬不要上他們當</p>
<p>吳開先謂：共產黨要將我們工人領導到錯誤路上去，工界人士希望的是有工作，能生活，我們所負的責任也是使每一工人有生活，而共黨適相反，請各位轉吿每一工人，千萬不要上他們的當，將自己給他們利用。</p>
<p>一致組織組大同盟</p>
<p>繼由方自蘇北啓東逃出來滬之郵務職工趙君報吿共黨對蘇北工友之欺騙行為後即一致決議：組織上海市工人反對內亂大同盟，通過大同盟理事會章程，推舉周學湘，水祥云，葉翔皋，袁召章，范才騤，陸克明，方如升，宋培堯，姚之賡，陳順興，唐振寳，胡夢麟，章祝三，仇長江，周福江，邵子英，梁永章，周云江，章子衡等四十五人為理事，十七人為候補理事，並即席通過吿工友書及上蔣主席制止亂源之電文及大同盟標語廿一條，於今晨起，發動全市工人，散貼標語，擴大宣傳，制止內亂。並定於今日下午三時在總工會召開反對內亂大同盟第一次理事會，最後臨時動議通過（一）谷工會代表不承認派林漢達，馬叙倫，蕢延芳，包達三為代表，晋京請願，並電主席申明。（二）否認假冒各工會名義散貼之反動標語。</p>
<p>通過上　主席電</p>
<p>（三）電呈主席，該會於昨日大會通過電呈主席電又之原文如下：「國民政府主譨蔣鈞鍳，抗戰勝利以後，全國人民方期　策　力，共謀建設，乃共黨藉口民主，實行割據，攻城略地，殘殺同胞，破壞交通，擾亂生產，使全國人民於飽經戰禍之餘，復遭流離失所之痛。政府顧全大局，一再委曲忍讓，相與談判，以冀和平統一，早日實現，惟共黨始終執迷不悟，言行不一，岡　信義。現停戰期限已屆，而其軍事擾亂，仍復着着進逼，陰謀技倆，層出不已，實欲置國家民族於萬刧不復之境而後已，工友等目擊心傷，難安械默，尙祈鈞座本旣定方針，當機立斷，採取嚴峻手段，制止亂源，全滬工友誓為後層，謹此電呈，伏維睿鑒。上海巿工人反對內亂大同盟謹叩。</p>
<p>鄭重否認「代表」</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市工人反對內亂大同盟及交通大學等各專科以上學校，以有人假借名議，自稱代表之馬叙倫，林漢達，包達三，黃延芳等晋京請願，一致鄭重否認，並分別電呈主席及朱敎長聲明。同時本巿學生總會，昨亦電呈國民政府，並分電南京學生界及新聞界，否認曾推舉馬叙倫，林漢達，黃延芳等為和平請願代表，促請注意。</p>
<h3>增高房地產　將自秋季開始</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市財政局徵收春季房地捐，迄目前為止，除保衛團服裝費外，已收一億七千餘萬元，應收三億三千餘元。又財局因　於本市稅收不敷支出，而收入着重於娛樂筵席捐，似欠公平，故房地捐將自秋季開始酌予增高。</p>
<h3>市商會會員大會　勝利後首次召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巿商會定今日上午九時，召開勝利後首次會員代表大會。參加之會員（各業公會）有二百二十餘單位，該會秘書處已收到各業公會之提案六十餘件，即將提付大會討論，並將於大會中硏討修改章程及選舉理監事。大會主席團由王曉籟·杜月笙·徐　　·金潤庠·葛傑臣等五人担任。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕靑年軍第二零六師復員靑年一批五百餘名，已由陝西南鄭行抵南京，其中第四批二百餘名，將於廿四日由京來滬，轉往福建·河北·山東及東北等地，就地升學及復業。該師特派聯絡參謀吳熊旦上尉，於昨日先遣來滬，部署食宿事宜。</p>
<h3>取締攤販售私貨　充公拍賣作善舉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巿警局察鑒於巿上攤販林立，出售美軍走私雜物，　頭軍糧等，不僅妨礙交通，有礙市容，且為非法營業，影響關稅及正當商店之營業，茲據該局調査，此項經售物品之來源，大多係由美軍個人出售，亦有小販於進口商在碼頭卸貨時偸竊而得，所謂黃牛黨之流，盜賣供應。現警局已加緊進行取締工作，除通令水上分局嚴密注意外，並建議市府，以後凡査獲此項攤販，立即沒收其物品，由市府公開拍賣，所得收入，悉充慈善救濟事業之用。</p>
<h3>葉吉卿念念家事　高院提訊兩「魔妻」　退庭後接見子女　獨與次女談論婚姻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日高院提訊兩個偽特工惡魔之未亡人，一為李逆士羣之妻葉吉卿，一為吳逆世寳之妻余愛珍。李妻年逾四十，身材窈窕，仍穿黑底白花旗袍，赤足着高跟皮鞋，風韻猶存。葉為浙江遂安人，四十四歲，住愚園路七四九弄六十八號，當其夫李士羣充任偽特工總部政治保衛局長時，為虎作倀，參與其事，廿八年九月，自任該部會計，經管伙食工餉雜用等事，宛如「七十六號」之主婦。卅二年三月，復由周逆佛海之介紹，任偽經濟委員會會員，至次年九月始去職。受訊時，葉態度鎭靜，一面答供，一面極力避免攝影記者之拍照。答供財產時，謂有房屋四處，外加金銀首飾，均經軍統局査封。問其為何要進七十六號？答因與李士羣為夫婦關係，而該部規定不准非職員住宿，故不得不掛「會計」之名，至於參與政見事，謂女流之輩焉能幹秘密政治工作。講到殺人，不特根本否認，且反問法官能否舉出其殺人在何年何月。至於偽經濟委員會會員事、並不否認，僅謂目的是為了方便　汽車，免得如陳羣之妻，被日兵拉下　頰云。退庭後　接見其子女，並與其次女談婚姻問題，對於家事猶念念不忘、然話不語數，即為法警還押矣。</p>
<p>受審時之李士群妻葉吉卿（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>佘愛珍</h3>
<p>為吳世寶死撑面子</p>
<p>另一　王之虫佘愛珍，由楊推事鼎曁李書記官　章，於下午開庭偵訊。佘亦赤足穿皮鞋，着淡紫色細格子旗袍，後腦掛一個大髮　。當攝影記者對準鏡頭向其拍照時，她一反前次之忸怩相，泰然處之。首由楊推事問她何時進七十六號？妙舉手以手帕掩嘴稍一思索，即答：「是在廿八年的八月裏。「問」：「什麽時候出來呢？」答：「廿九年那年生了傷寒病，所以九月裏便搬出來了。「問：「你做偽警衛隊的會計做到那一年？」答：「廿九年走出七十六號後就不做了。」問：「為什麼不做呢？」佘即故作大聲答道：「我本來是掛名的。」問及特工總部內部情形時，則支吾不作詳答。乃諭暫退。</p>
<p>傳訊證人不知所云</p>
<p>另傳證人夏仲明，夏為七十六號翻譯，並任偽調査統計部辦事處長，據其供稱：彼於廿八年七月加入偽方，知吳世寶於卅一年死於蘇州，七十六號之實際負責人是李士羣，關於警衛隊的內情並不明白，佘愛珍之作惡更不得而知云。嗣訊偽中國銀行副經理李祖萊，問其與余愛珍之關係，答稱祗見過幾面，並不熟悉，外界所傳，全屬謠言。至於佘愛珍之罪行，彼旣無憑據，自不能瞎說，故不知其行為究竟如何，而前所供關於佘之財產部分，乃屬實情云。又傳沈鳳崗供稱：彼原為中央工作，民國廿八年二次被捕後，始入七十六號特工總部　衛隊任職，該隊由吳世寶任隊長，彼時佘愛珍並不擔任任何工作。至方液仙　捕事，彼亦不知云。</p>
<p>對夫罪行猶圖掩飾</p>
<p>至此，楊推事又傳佘愛珍入庭，自供曾任偽警衛隊會計職，惟對其夫之罪行，猶處處掩飾，口又為其亡夫撑面子說：「滬西的賭台，戰前就有了，並不是借世寶的勢力興盛起來的，並無供烟一事。至於所謂檯子銅鈿，並非是世寶要，是那些老　自己送上來孝敬他的」。經李書記官一一記錄在卷後，即吿退庭，改期再訊。</p>
<h3>市區棚屋勒令拆遷　工務局決定下週起實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來搭蓋棚屋之風甚熾，若干巿民竟不願業主產權，不問地區，任意選擇他人土地大蓋房屋，雖經市工務局通令拆除，仍多置之不理，甚至前日工務局及警察局派員前往某地干涉而遭毆打情事。巿工務局前曾布吿，凡市區內一概不准搭蓋棚屋，郊區建屋祗准於離公路十五呎以外。現拆屋限期已屆，工務局決於下週起，由警局合作協助勒令拆遷。又對於强佔他人土地，亦可由業主申訴工務局要求拆除，同時該局不日即將公布規例，以解決目前非法築屋。</p>

<h3>偽滬財局副局長　蔡羹堯處刑十年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偽上海財政局副局長蔡羹堯，昨日下午在高院特刑庭宣判，主文文：蔡羹堯，通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處有期徒刑十年，褫奪公權十年。又偽方特工總部蘇州站偵行組長薛其壽，亦於同時宣判，處有期徒刑三年，褫奪公權三年，二犯之全部財產，除酌留家屬必需之生活費外，沒收。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕偽浙江省政府財政應長張德欽，汪逆精衛之私人秘書，及偽宣傳部國際宣傳局長湯良禮，均於昨日下午審理終結，定廿九日下午二時宣判。</p>
<h3>陳元盛敗於少女手中　金磗案主犯從上虞緝獲解滬　幽篁深處病懨懨持壺把卷</h3>
<p>猛抬頭如夢起　記否雙携水畔拾金時</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕這幾天來，每一個上海人在翻開報紙的時候，總不免對那一則長行廣吿看一看：「中央銀行懸賞緝拿逃員陳元盛……」。漸漸的，大家彷彿覺得對這位年方三十的靑年熟悉起來了。</p>
<p>陳元盛在五月二十三日那天，偸了金條美金票逃走；在昨天，六月二十二日，被警察局押　上海。金條，美金，一生的名譽價値不算小，但是陳元盛所得到的却祗是三十天的歡樂！</p>
<p>在上海中央銀行發現失竊的時候，杭州的華興公寓到了一個剛從上海來的靑年旅客，他穿着米色靑年裝，黃皮鞋，白草帽，黑眼鏡，在六十九號開了一個房間。在循環簿上，他寫：「陳君實，年三十歲」。</p>
<p>這位陳君實手面非常闊綽，每天用掉三四十萬，簡直不算一回事。在杭州玩了一個禮拜，天天過着花天酒地的生活。六月一日，他又到蘇州嘉興去玩了，又過了六七天才回到了杭州。</p>
<p>那時候杭州剛剛開始禁舞。陳君實在那些鶯鶯燕燕之前做了一次慷慨解囊的孟嘗君。</p>
<p>然而，回到公寓裏的時候，他却已經把所有報紙都買來，帶一點驚慌地仔細誦讀了。</p>
<p>六月十二日，他忽然問茶房：「到保俶塔羊坊橋三十七號是怎樣走的？」</p>
<p>羊坊橋三十七號是一宅精緻的別墅，陳君寶在那天找到之後。一直住到了六月十七。他吿訴看門的老婆婆說，他要出門吃喜酒，大概一兩天就可以回來。</p>
<p>但是他太心慌了，在房間裏留下了一張紙條，上面畫着一張簡單的地圖，還註着「浙江上虞」四個字。</p>
<p>六月十八日起，陳君實就不見了。可是就在那天下午一點鐘上海的黃浦分局得着了一個機密萬分的電話。有人密報，陳元盛已經在杭州發現！</p>
<p>當天下午四點，黃浦分局的司法股長周光輝，巡官姚鴻章，營長韓祖辰，跳上了到杭州去的特別快車。晚上九點，他們趕到了杭州，馬上會同省會警察局，展開極嚴密的搜索。西園咖啡館的侍者說見過這樣一個人，身邊當常有美麗的舞女和歌女，常常在冠生園吃飯……那個人住在華興公寓……到了寳俶塔羊坊橋！</p>
<p>時候已經午夜一點鐘了，正下着傾盆大雨，周股長等一行人趕到了那宅別墅，找到了那張寫着「浙江上虞」的紙條！</p>
<p>明天，他們向上出發了。渡過了錢塘江，到達西興，杭曹公路的汽車站上，賣票員曾看見這樣一個人，包了一部小汽車到曹娥江。警員們緊追上去，掠過蕭山紹興，下午三點過曹娥江，追到了百官。</p>
<p>在百官檢查的時候，一家小旅館的茶房吿訴他們說，兩天以前，曾一個三十歲的寗波靑年，叫陳龍，曾經住過一夜，不過已經乘船到上虞去了。</p>
<p>探員們步行走過一座高山，到達距離十五里的梁湖，雇了一只脚划船，經過三十五里水程，在晚間七點半，追到了上虞！</p>
<p>這位「陳龍」在上虞曾理過一次髮，他問過轎夫，想到丁家宅陶塲灣去。轎夫要他三萬五千塊錢，他說錢已經不够了，一個賣木炭的自願引路，他才離開了上虞。</p>
<p>警員們找到了這個賣炭的，小河裏沒有船，就涉水而過，前面是三十里崎嶇不平的山路！</p>
<p>路的盡頭是一座峭壁。警員們在荆棘叢裏爬了上去，這就是陶場灣！</p>
<p>四面都是竹林。幽篁深處，一座茅屋前面，有一個老太太在編篾器。</p>
<p>就在這茅屋旁邊，坐着陳元盛！</p>
<p>他們右手拿着一把酒壸，左手拿着一卷書。一看見警員，他很客氣的說：「諸位很辛苦了了！」</p>
<p>他說：他天天看報，不想為了他一個人，竟叫許許多多親戚朋友都吃了官司。他已經三夜沒有好好睡覺，深夜的犬吠加深了推不開忘不了的心事！他已經發了幾天寒熱了。</p>
<p>他說，「累你們這樣奔走，心裏非常慚愧——不過，如果你們遲來了一天，我恐怕倒又不在此地了。」</p>
<p>陳元盛眞是病了，實在走不動，還是警員們把他扶下了山。他們當夜趕回百官，到西興，已經封江了，小船在黑夜裏衝過了風濤，晚上十點半到了杭州，陳元盛在省會警察局第一次嘗到了鐵窗風味。</p>
<p>昨天下午六點十分，興致勃勃的警員們興奮地把陳元盛帶到了黃浦分局。</p>
<p>這一個月裏，陳元盛總算過了幾天在「天堂」裏的生活。他到了蘇州，到過杭州，和美麗的少女游過西湖，參過靈隊寺，在靈隱寺前，忽然一根金條從口袋裏掉了出來，落在陰溝裏，那位少女俯下身去想把它檢起來，陳元盛說，「何必呢？性命要緊啊！」</p>
<p>據說，打電話到黃浦分局去的，也就是這位少女！</p>
<p>陳元盛離開上海的時候，他帶了三條金條，二十六萬現款。一條掉在杭州了，一條已經換了三十天的享受。中央銀行祗能拿回一條金條，拿來捉陳元盛的兩百萬元賞格，大概差不多了。</p>

<h3>特稿　印度唯一的新聞學府</h3>
<p>— 周祥光</p>
<p>旁遮普大學</p>
<p>印度的新聞事業，可算是相當發達，每一城鎭，都有當地的報紙出版，除英文外，還有當地語文的報紙。如在加爾各答一地，除英文外，有孟加拉文（Bengli)烏都文（Urdu）的報紙，如在拉河（Lahore）有旁遮普文（Punjabi）的報紙，便是一例外。雖然，印度新聞事業發展迅速，但造就新聞事業人員的敎育機關，在全印中却祗有旁遮普大學（Punjal　University）的一個新聞學系，作者於今年春間，應旁遮普大學納德（Nath）及彭都（Bandhu）諸敎授之邀，自喜馬拉雅山的哈耳達河（Hardwar）乘印度西北鐵路火車，到了拉河。這是旁遮普省的省會，中國佛經上，呌做五河，為印度古城之一。在英統治印度以前，曾為默罕默德及錫克王朝（Sikh　Empire）之故都。現在上海警局服務之高大的紅頭巡捕，便是。錫克人。今日為印度西北邊防及敎育工商業之重鎭。關於敎育方面，在拉河城內，即有十三個學院，中小學更不計在內。作者為了澈底明白旁遮普大學新聞學系的敎學情形起貝，曾由印友納德敎授（Prof　Nath）陪同至大學參觀。考旁大新聞系，成立於一九四一年十月一日，歷史雖屬不久，但該系發展至速。所有畢業學生，皆服務於全印各大報紙，今日旁遮普省新聞局副局長，便是該系畢業的學生。該系專任敎授計有六人，至於講師力面，均由當地報社社長及主筆兼任之，按時來校講授功課。該系主任為辛氏（Prof．P．P．Singh),昔年曾畢業於美國米蘇里新聞學院及英國倫敦大學新聞科,為印度報界之先進。學生入學程度，須獲有學士學位者方可，修學期限，定為一年。該系上課時間，定自每天下午四時至七時，故該校若干研究院學生，每日上午除上其本課外，下午還可兼修新課程，更便利於有志新聞事業的職業靑年，有以進修機會。往往研究院學生，畢業之時，拿來兩張文憑，一張為其本科，一張即是新聞系的證書，學生學費，每月十五盾，膳費二十五盾，至其他證書費，登記費，圖書館借書保證金，及新聞學會會員費等在內，每月不過五十盾左右而已。費用之省，概可想見。學生畢業考試，計有三個試卷：（一）新聞學理論，（二）英文新聞習作，（三）印地（Hindi）烏都（Urdu）及旁遮普文（Punjabi），新聞習作。至於該系日常課程，大概可分為五類:(一)新聞採訪，（二）新聞編排，（三）新聞述昨，（四）大樣校對，（五）書刋討論。除此以外，尙有補助課程，如經理　　業務，廣吿學，新聞史，比較新聞學，及新聞道德等頗屬完備。同時該系學生，除課本講授外，則由該校當局按時派往各報社實習，俾使理論與工作互證，用收知行合一之效。拉河報紙甚多，其著者為軍民報（Civil　&amp;　Military）(Gazette），銷行最廣。印度報紙的發行，大都有其背景所在有為英國機關報者，如政治家報，有為各黨派宣傳者，如甘露市場報（國大黨），晨報（屬回聯），國家主義者報（屬大乘黨）。作者曾與該系畢業學生相談，彼等對於中國新聞事業，鮮有所知，當我談及加爾各答有兩種報紙時，一為中國日報（言論較近民主一點），一為印度日報（國民黨機關報），更為彼等嘆服。吾國從事文化事業人員，隔於外國語言文字，未能為祖國文化，傳播異土，今後舉世實現新聞自由，更以新聞自由，為奠立國際永久和平之手段，所望我們報業同志，應多與外國新聞事業機關合作聯繫，收相互瞭解之功，此為作者的一點希望。（五月十三日寄於印度加爾各答中華學校）</p>

<p>華聯今日迎戰星東；共計七位大將，均經足委會鄭重選拔決定，觀上列名單，便知屆時不難排出强有力之陣容，雖正式戰錢，尙待臨塲決定，惟一般推測，邦倫守門，後衛將由嚴士鑫吳祺祥分任，中堅一席，當屬諸鐔福楨，前衛則以瞿永福高保正最為理想，前鋒五虎，曹秋亭本可出塲，但為退能讓賢能計，將由李垚出馬，李垚與阿孫搭檔，素所默契，中鋒當推李義臣，阿奎春華如果配合，亦必勝任愉快，尙不知當局如何決定。</p>
<p>星東</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>許竟成　霍耀華</p>
<p>羅　權　郭英祺　劉松生</p>
<p>李碩友　黎兆榮　張金海　馮景祥　鄧廣森</p>
<p>（生力軍）侯榕生　馮坤勝</p>
<p>星東變更　中衛陣綫</p>
<p>星東客軍，鑒於所受靑白一戰之敎訓，昨由領隊胡好及隊長許竟成縝密商討決定，門將朱兆恒，以往數戰，雖微呈慌張，但近况尙見進步，後衛一職，由左脚王與霍耀華分任，中堅為郭英祺，羅偉權，劉松生輔弼左右。前鋒方面，李碩友黎兆榮一搭一檔各就本位，張金海膺中軍要職，馮景祥鄧廣森亦得其所，如此編排　　聯塔稱　　相當。今日星東前鋒後衛，均無問題，竟成後調，中衝線是否能予堅守，將為今日勝負之關鍵。</p>

<h3>調查拳擊比賽　法部似無根據</h3>
<p>美檢察總長稱</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕美檢察總長之代言人克拉克，本日稱：美司法部似無法理上之根據，從事調査本星期三在紐約舉行之喬路易與倍萊康之拳賽。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕民主黨衆議員奧都爾昨日指斥前晚重量拳擊家喬路易與倍萊康之戰為騙局，要求進行調査，拳賽主辦人耶各勃反誣奧都爾企圖「拆賬敲詐」，奧都爾今日向衆議院宣稱：渠準備正式起訴，要求耶各勃賠償名譽損失十萬美元。</p>

<h3>公債黑市潰不成軍　統丙再跌六百元　操業者集議停止買賣</h3>
<p>公債昨吿破裂，黑市已潰不成軍，喊價不一，完全以「講斤頭」姿態演出，多方準備收貨，空方無貨可交，持貨者亦不肯輕易將實貨脫手，形成僵局，低價雖減二百元，然以所值過微，除軋直交易外，實貨以所入太爲零星，幷無多大成交，統丙九時半後始有零令星之兜做，自二〇〇元買價做起，最後空方有所軋平，八百元左右有買，較前收再跌六百元，操業者集議停止賣買，至七月後再做，幷有向當局要請酌量優待等說，旣無正式開做，雜牌遂吿岑寂。</p>
<h3>金價下挫　較前小六萬五</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以停戰令延至月底，人心本已轉向，中央更在市頻使壓迫，經此雙重打擊，金價昨圓跌頗多，自晨初一九七萬五開後陸續下挫，浮多斬售，中央隨市供給，形成供過於求，十時後退至一九三萬以下，中央配給七七條，價一九二萬，低價跌至一九一萬五，午刻稍吿回升，午後極爲平靜，結果較前收回跌六萬五，飾金廿萬〇四，紋銀平，暗拆息價仍自一角二分至一角半。</p>
<h3>美鈔回跌　港幣繼漲</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔亦稍回小，惟低後尚吿穩健，晨開二七一〇元，開後逐步下挫，金市怯疲，套賣股勤，最低退至二六三〇元始吿微穩，午刻回升至二六六〇元左右，午後平靜，結果較前收回跌七十元，港幣續吿向榮，高後略有回下，結果較前收漲十五元，港滙繼續扳高，惟交易已不若前日之盛，高價五四〇元而後稍回，羅比被動帶高至六五〇元，英滙八千元，均以手續關係而乏對做，美滙掛牌仍平。</p>
<h3>紗花平疲　布市漸秀</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨平庸，粵帮雙馬吸胃已淡，價乃下墜三四萬，中小型紗尚稱穩定，然交易寥寥，僅有南京帮辦去低檔廿支紗數十件，四十二支同行買賣不少，然實用廠家需要仍廢。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訉訊報昂十至十八磅音，計近期美金二九、三九，遠期二九、五四，米特林現貨三〇、〇一，本埠現棉市况平穩，惟以債市與黃金不振，兼以週六關係，廠家與花號均存觀望，致交易殊形稀少。　布市稍形轉好，因粵帮對於漂布士林布納胃較强，蜀豫兩帮搜羅嗶嘰尤股，於是人心益挺，情况略佳，但其他帮口仍未見十分暢達，各布漲二，二百五十元至五十元，中午中紡公司開售各布似格平平，嗶嘰仍無供給，故午後市態愈昂。</p>
<h3>人造絲突回跌</h3>
<p>較上日小十餘萬元</p>
<p>恍惚靡定之人吿絲市，越昨進銳，昨日退亦速，一二〇號天橋有光，開盤一百八十二萬元，最小喊過七十八萬元，終做八十二萬元，下午做八十萬元，較上日下降十三四萬元，雜牌做六十五萬元及六十萬元，七五號金鷄牛光，又回做週三一百五十八萬元原盤，廠經市况淸靜，做開殊鮮，喊價未動，綢貨大誠格子　縐又吿疲落，上午五千三百五十元，下午做二百二十元，比上日小二百元强，美亞被面交易寥寥，喊價仍在一百五十二三萬元之間</p>
<h3>美白金價提高　近期八十二元五角</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿二日電〕美國各主要白金廠商，目前標價雖仍在每盎斯美金五十三元至五十六元之間，但商務日報今日載稱，若干經紀商已將價格提至八十元，華爾街主要商號亦已將近期交貨之白金提至八二·五〇元，遠期交貨八〇元。</p>
<h3>車白糖又創高價</h3>
<p>同業要求改善開貨辦法</p>
<p>昨糖市初平後堅，車白以貨缺更形俏俐，又創新高價，公會劃盤二十號中砂白上午爲十一萬元，旋微降爲十萬〇八千元至七千元，午收八千元，下午復緊爲十一萬元至十一萬二千元，棧單廿號十萬〇八千元，廿二號十一萬元，三牛車白劃至十五萬元，升萬餘元，生砂亦劃十萬〇三四千元之高價，號盤開出興化白十一萬五千元至十一萬九千元，興化赤十萬〇五六千元，計百餘　，刁靑二十餘件，九萬六千元，升四千元，下午由同業在公會開會，決定要求台灣公司改善開貨辦法，於下週二開售中砂，最好仍照第一期辦法，較爲公平適當，查公司經營台糖於採辦運輸方面，佔有絕對優勢及便利，而於開售方面，亦有充份主動權，故對於行方似宜稍予便利，俾收互助之效而免時生反感。</p>
<p>又據台灣公司負責人聲稱，公開拋售，並非絕對治標辦法，本公司在台存貨，近廿萬噸，下週準可由招商局之海辰輪及馬勒台北兩輪代裝，共約一萬噸抵滬，届時儘量應市，作有效抑止。繼稱，此次糖價波動原因，不外（一）暑季冷飲增加消耗，（二）天津，漢口糖價高出滬地幾達百分之五十，（三）商人囤積，甚有將棧單在市塲高價轉售者。</p>
<h3>美棉又有到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國總統輪船公司之賴愛克斯博士號，由西雅圖運來棉花二萬六千七百七十餘件，昨晨進口，現泊虹口公利祥碼頭起卸。又該公司之喬其皮克利蘭號，亦裝棉花，約今日可到埠。</p>
<h3>燒堿確將派貨　下週尙有到貨</h3>
<p>據滬市燒碱川戶云，近日外傳某洋行行將開始燒碱派貨說，並非全屬予虛，緣該洋行現儲大量燒碱，必須按照戰前用量之多寡，計算其目前之派貨數量，聞前次派貨分甲乙丙丁四種，每種所派數量，將較前放寬，惟價格是否仍照上次派貨，每相以十六萬元計算，尚難預測，但衆信外商洋行不致因市價之上落，而改變一貫之傾銷政策。</p>
<p>據本市某行商稱：燒碱下週尚有大批來滬，昨日塲內外成交數量頗少，僅爲急於候用之另星小戶，因外貨滾滾而來，人心疲軟，執貨者困難求售，用戶亦多數抱觀望態度。</p>
<h3>龍口粉步漲不已</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干，以粵港去化不絕，市勢頻見上展。昨市再創新高價，上莊開至十六萬五千元，升萬餘元，行盤十七萬元，仍看續緊，蓋貨底單薄，絕少鬆象云。</p>
<p>亞洲缺米四百億磅　戰前後世界米產比較　〔路透社紐約二日電〕一九四五—四六年季世界米產量，已降至六·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·按上年為六·八〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美斗，戰前之平均數則為七·四〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美斗，據貿易界人士稱一九四六—四七季之美國國內產量，或可增加，本季內最感匱乏之區爲亞洲，該區產量之低減情形，爲歷來所未有，一九四六年世界各國可資輪出之米量，估計約爲二十億至四十億磅，而亞洲食米不足之數，估計將達四百億磅之多。本年中國，印度，日本，非律賓羣島等處之糧荒，極為嚴重。</p>
<h3>桐油豬鬃　大量輸出</h3>
<p>最近出口貿易已漸發動，一星期內成交數量最鉅者首推猪鬃桐油，其原因乃以英滙逐漸恢復水準狀態，海外市塲擴第所致，其結果不獨外滙得以加增，即國內產本亦可與世界一般物價逐漸趨向平衡，蓋自我國開放外滙以來，雖曾吸收大量物資，對於「料」的方面一時稱充沛，價格日平惟「工」的方面，依然仍在激漲，因之一般物價猶未能如預期漸復常軌，國人亦無從作一正確判斷，今賴出口物資之在海外銷售，當能參照世界物價作合理調整。</p>
<h3>香港規定　進口貨物利潤</h3>
<p>「港訊〕本市當局前爲加強物價之統制，除對於日常必需品如柴米及若干項糧食等，仍照舊規定公價外，所有商人自由遝售之物品，亦經規定公假，以示限制，近以商店所定價格，仍有較公價爲高，經又規定凡進口物品，普遍加以一定之利潤，其利潤額不得超過百分之廿云，最近以購買美滙較前爲易，故來港貨物，日有增加，美國新貨亦有陸續運到，市塲中澳州貨品尤多云。</p>
<h3>中蠶生絲　由中信局收購</h3>
<p>本年春繭貸欵，總額原定二百億，截至六月十八日止，實貸一六八億八四七七萬。銀團方面，決定所有未貸足部份，即日起停止貸放，以資結束。</p>
<p>中國蠶絲公司，本年三月間曾核准第一批以繭易絲廠商共二十一家，截至本月二十日各廠商已繳生絲逾一千二百餘担該公司目前以存絲數量尚多，曾派員與中信局易貨處洽訂合約，聞合約內容規定嗣後該公司所有生絲，由中信局收購轉運出口。</p>
<h3>華股受公債影響　昨市無正式交易　喊價較前收續跌　又有三號家倒閉</h3>
<p>華股有大戶數家亦遭波及，本身發生問題，影響全體經營者都吿停止營業，昨市並無正式交易，延至十時後，始有零星交易，最低時永紗四七〇元，美亞二七〇〇元以下，景福一九〇元，新光一九五元，勤興一六〇元，嗣後即逐漸回升，多空互有軋直，成交雖吿寂寞，午刻都見高價，冷門中小型僅較爲股實者稍有做開，喊價亦被帶小少許，元老股並未喊價，結果較前收照喊價計算，各股除勤興平平外，餘者均吿跌半成左右，未來形勢極爲恍惚，至於外股交易尚形正常，各股亦被動下落，怡紗低價時到八二〇〇元，而後稍吿回上，除會德豐英聯亞洲外，餘者亦少活動，續趨下游，午刻轉呈徘徊，結果較前收計亞洲英聯會德豐平平，怡紗怡啤紙業鋼業業廣均告小挫。</p>
<p>又訊，天一·飛達等號　蝕倒閉問題尚未解決，昨續有證據券大樓七樓之仁昌同盛及中央路華僑大厦八樓大貿等三家證劵號宣吿倒閉淸理云。</p>
<h3>祁紅產價高　談判不易接近</h3>
<p>安徽祁門出產之紅茶，據產區消息，今年新貨業已上市，目前已裝抵杭州，惟因採製及一切繳用異常浩大，故成本殊足驚人，近日買戶雖趨前向貨主談判，惜雙方各自喊價，是以迄今尚未獲得圓滿解決，其他花色，蒞滬尚稱蟬聯、但執貨人心鑒於產區茶價並未稍廉，以致一味堅守，而本街店莊及蘇州等地受不能隨心所欲之影響，態度咸懷觀望，交易大爲減色，市勢沉靜異常，價格方面大致穩定，至於洋莊茶市，連日本市茶商積極謀聞朗之道，刻下午昌安徽新華震和等數家，續有在開工趕製中，於日內即擬報關出口云。</p>
<h3>呢絨閒散</h3>
<p>呢絨市面，因夏銷已逝，秋銷有待，兼南美洲呢絨續有到埠，拆息始終站定二角之則，預購及買進者均寡，以致造成零躉交易俱轉閒散，各地客帮亦未有正當需辦，衣社與長樂及棋盤街上諸茶會，一般掮客跑街集市者亦漸减少，因之各種貨價均多平疲。雜糧實銷轉暢　米市交易甚少</p>
<h3>雜糧實銷轉暢　米市交易甚少</h3>
<p>米市塲昨日仍鮮交易，各米號門市而貨皆由市塲指定米行照市撥配，人心尚稱穩定，各檔貨原盤未更，惟次等貨則鮮有做開，大抵次貨已作高貨交易，昨日客貨登記未見增加，總數僅及一六九九石，內計白粳八〇九石，薄稍五〇石，羊秈一九〇石，杜秈七五石，無秈一五〇石，白二二四石，碾秈二〇一石。</p>
<p>雜糧趨勢堅穩，小麥出口帮收羅殷動，採購運往靑島等地，近日到貨尚旺，塲內供求活躍，價格繼續挺昇一二千元光景，黃豆蠶豆實銷暢達，交易活潑，價均向上邁進，今再吿昇千元左右、麵粉因昨暴昇頗烈，今恐再趨上漲，以致影響各貨市面，故暫無交易，油市勢稱平穩，買賣正常，價格人於盤旋，荳餅隨黃豆挺升二三百元。</p>

<h3>我空軍第八大隊新壯舉　日本初航記</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>由大東機場起飛　向東京進發</p>
<p>五月廿七日的淸晨，上海大塲機塲飛起一架銀白色四引擎雙尾舵的大飛機，地面上航空委員會主任周至柔，寧靜的看着由他下令的飛機垷在完美的起飛了。這種飛機裝滿了油，以機件良好小駕駛技術慣熟，雖然到日本東京是第一次初航，周將軍相信她安全到達是毫無問題的，等到飛機的影子渺小了之後，王世　大隊長就陪侍周將軍乘車駛回營房去。</p>
<p>這架起飛到日本去的飛機，是B—24式四二四六一號機，由空軍第八大隊卅三中隊錢祖倫隊長駕駛，劉善本參謀在第二駕駛員座位上與錢隊長每隔十五分鐘輸換駕駛航行，領航員尹士悅不時計算着航向航程通信員林道釪在收發報機前生着耳机注意的聽着電波的聲響，機械員汪積成要照管全個飛機的機件，機械士熊倒楣協助他，空運大隊通信長王堃和有時還坐到駕駛位置上、替代做下副駕駛，好讓駕駛之一能有喝一杯茶解渴的餘裕。</p>
<p>飛出大塲十分鐘之後，黃海就在機　下面代替了長江三角洲的綠色土地，根據航向八十二度，由上海到日本本土是漸漸向東北飛的，這飛機因爲遇着西南吹向東北的季候風，每小時二十浬（海里，以下均同。）的助力，所以每小時以一百六十八浬空速航進）。</p>
<p>錢祖倫隊長這一個空動小組，是中國空軍有名的三十組裏面的一組。（民國三十二年第一批赴美學習飛行B—24機的人員被稱爲三十組）這一組人如同其他各組人的經歷一樣，在卅四年戰爭快結束以前，匆匆的由美國越大西洋東飛，滿以爲回來可以打一打日本，卻不料在印度凍結的歲月裏，眼看着櫻花突地凋謝了。英雄們捧着一份日本投降的報紙，遺憾着不曾達成現實任務，這以後，只好把光陰放在上海駐防的軍營裏老去。幸好光復後的河山這麼遼闊，B—24的遠程飛行可以像鯨魚在大海中，任其飛翔遠泳，這次航行日本的任務，落在身上，當然更令人興奮。　出海以後，飛行高度逐漸昇起，到九千尺就固定下來，黃海把日本破碎島土隔在中國四百五十浬的彼岸。從去年八月以來，這海面再不是日本的內湖，日本飛機是一隻也不再飛翔，海輪即使航行，也非日本自己的意志。B—24在海上二小時四十分，差不多像在睡眼境界旅行。看不到一隻船，也不曾遇到一隻飛機，綠的海水反映着無遮蔽的烈日强光，錢祖倫·劉善本，把飛行眼鏡帶上，去看玻窗外的海天風鏖，他們想着：要是去轟炸日本，那航程決沒有這般的寂寞，心情也不像空運飛行時這麼寗靜。他們想；這眞有點像在美國的假期把汽車開到荒寂的森林，還去聽流泉一般逃出滿街熙攘的人間世界。</p>
<p>在厚木機場降陸　美教官迎候</p>
<p>這天淸晨，劉善本駕了吉普車到江灣美軍基地要來的氣象預測表完全是對的。那表上說明，海上無雲，現在證實了。那表上說，風述十五浬至二十浬，現在正得着風神吹助，比無風空速正好快那麼多。那表上說，在日本本土的雲最初一段都在五千尺以下，快完成航程的終點富士山附近，有高積雲在一萬四千尺左右，因爲富士山高一萬二千三百八十五尺，所以那航程高度應該在一萬三千尺左右，這些都得在進入日本本土以後來證實了。</p>
<p>中午十二點以後，飛機進入島嶼羣的日本九州西北邊五島上空，不久即是佐世保在機翼下過去。B—24在九州北角劃了一缐，進入伊豫灘，在四國上空，飛機仍舊是飛九千尺高。因爲到太州之前，日本是沒有九千尺以上的高山，四國上空有雲了，飛機在雲上航進，不時與地面美軍電台聯絡。出四國陸地在紀伊水道上空過海，在和歌山南進人本州的紀伊山脈上空，入遠江灘海面，本應依八十二度航向直前，到東京灣外相模灘的大島上空，再轉北飛十度航向到厚木機塲（Atsugi），美國人所定的航線可以說是非常週密平安，可是飛行人員的心理總是能以平到一分鐘總是早點到達的好。在遠江灘外一拐灣上了松濱上空。由松濱，擦過左邊的富士山麓，富士山果然錢峨，一萬二千多尺，白雪積頂不溶，山巔火山穴口，有墨烟裊裊。這座山給日本人一些誇大的狂妄鼓勵，加上鮮美易凋的櫻花，與日本柔順的女德，結合而或日本武士精神。這結晶品像日本本土地層的震動力，給日本演了一幕大悲劇，　飛機在厚木機塲八千尺長的大跑道上落地。美軍一羣以及中國駐日代表團人員，在塲迎候。朱世明團長，戴堅師長等先行，錢隊長與一個在美國的敎官這時服務於東京美軍總部，二人握手叙舊，美國敎官頗以他的學生能以駕機來日本為榮，到處向人介紹他的高足，要面子似乎比中國人還亮。</p>
<p>飛遍了日本上空　繞道抵首都</p>
<p>六月六日B24在厚木機塲起飛了，乘客還是朱世明團長，戴堅師長。這一次要看一下日本全部版圖上幾顆星似的大城市，在東京（關於東京的見聞）容俟另篇報道編者）。上空看了皇宮，南飛橫濱，在橫須賀軍港上空，轉往靜岡過松濱再飛西北古名屋。在名古屋上空盤旋，讓朱世明，戴堅二氏從空中察看將來中國佔領軍登陸碼頭以及營房位置。朱戴二氏並爲駕駛員指明營址。由名古屋過琵琶湖就是京都，日本本土就只有京都是完整的，沒有什麼被炸痕跡。紅瓦白牆，風光綺麗。</p>
<p>飛機經過大阪，神戶之後，就到本州西南里岸廣島灣看廣島，我們都知道原子彈打欺日本，原子彈第一顆就是落在廣島。</p>
<p>劉善本參謀說：「在廣島上空，我們看到有四條河緊靠着流人廣島灣海水中，廣島市區是不是在河業的入海處，我們不敢判定。我們正在找尋時，朱團畏指着一塊很大的正方形紅黃色廣塲說：「這就是人口十一萬的廣島。「我們的精神像戳了一針，趕忙定睛注視這塊震動世界的百里黃塲。這眞是夷平。房屋毁滅的時候，看殘存的斷牆是向一面倒斜可知這是震而不是炸。炸區的殘渣不多，在被炸時、人和屋都被震成灰塵上揚天空，四飄散落，故而是沒有等最的殘渣存留，奇怪的是廣島的黃塲裏還存有三幢完整的純白色房屋，這唯一說明是白的顏色對原子彈可以抗震嗎？我們搞不清楚。</p>
<p>「在方場的三角尖上，有三個屋叢存在着。這就是原子彈所不及的區域了。初初一看，我以爲這三個屋業之一是廣島，純朱團長指認，我們方知廣島給完全抹掉了，他只剩着這三個郊區的小尾巴！」</p>
<p>身材修長的劉善本參謀，說完了站起身，說道：「過長峙，我沒有注意，隊長看到的。</p>
<p>我轉着身子看錢祖倫，他正抽着煙斗，噴出一口靑煙，說：「長崎也炸成了一個方形火塲，灰紅色的。」</p>
<p>正像我們燒鍋的爐灶那般火紅色。」尹士悅加以描繪式的解釋。錢着重的附和着這個解釋。</p>
<p>「我看到長崎夾在山與海間，山在市區東南邊，替原子彈的震動力做了一堵擋牆，因山外的屋宇是好的，長崎市是人字形區械，伸入海中的一段堤島屋宇還是好的。這方塲四週全是綠色樹與草，威力所不及之處，紅瓦洋房依舊挺立着，渡牠刦後餘生。」尹士悅說。</p>
<p>他們飽看二塊原子方塲，因後就由長崎出海南飛，路上回爲遇逆風，加上東遊西走，繞道很多，所以上午八點五分起飛，直到下午四點十二分才飛到首都，公飛了八點零八分鐘，才落在南京郊外大較塲基地。（六月十五日，上海。）</p>

<p>湘省財政廳長胡邁貪污案，係去年九月由最高法院發交辦理，經長沙地院檢審官詳細偵查後，即以囤購糧食及擅提公款圖利起訴，列舉貪污數額達八千萬以上。本月十二日，刑庭又曾一度審訊，惟胡以在押病劇，迄今尙未審理終結，茲將胡案前後經過詳情，益報如次。（編者）</p>
<p>此案爲十年來湖南最大貪污案，故轟動一時，檢察官之公訴狀內，認胡氏假借名義購進之食穀，達二萬七千石之多，可謂駭人聽聞。</p>
<p>薛伯陵主湘時　胡邁任財廳長</p>
<p>胡邁，字彥遠，湖南湘潭人，現年五十四歲，爲湖南名敎育家胡子靖先生之公子。胡子靖先生創辦之明德中學，蜚聲南北，與天津南開齊名，有「南明德北南開」之稱。子靖先生逝世後，胡氏卽繼承其父，主持校務。胡原服務於行政院。薛伯陵主湘，胡氏卽問湘任財政廳長，兼田賦糧食管理處，歷時八載，本年二月方辭職。</p>
<p>外傳說脫離省府　情形確甚復雜</p>
<p>湖南省會自民國廿七年大火後，卽移設湘西沅陵，廿八年薛岳主湘，卽下令遷至湘南之耒陽，以便與軍事配合。胡氏始終在耒主持　務、卅三年春長戰事發生，耒陽遭受威脅，遂有遷移之議。彼時各方意見，頗不一致，有主遷湘西，與大後方切取聯絡者，有主移湘南支持軍事者。省府委員會討論此事時·曾有激烈之爭執。迨後，經薛主席決定省會移設嘉禾藍山山地，而胡氏卽率財廳一部人員及田糧處全體，間道走湘西。據謂係因供應軍糧關係，故田糧處非到湘西不可，先在洪江辦公，旋又遷至沅陵，直至戰時結東時爲止。其時外間即有傳說謂胡氏脫離省府而獨立。事實上，亦確係非驢非馬，情形極爲複雜，而財廳離省府而去，自引起人之不滿。戰事結束，胡氏隨吳梧生返長沙，各廳處亦相繼選回，省府機構方臻健全。至本年二月，胡氏始離職，由楊銳靈氏繼任。</p>
<p>離職後即被控　侵占福利公欵</p>
<p>胡氏離職不久，田糧處一部職員，卽向長沙地方法院控吿胡氏，侵占該處員工福利社公款，同人應得紅利，俱爲胡氏所吞沒，胡氏當被傳訊。田糧處職員數十人，亦先後被傳作證，偵察二月，卒以違反糧食管理及食污之罪被提出公訴，並將胡氏及其任內之會計主任文名鼎拘押地方法院，以便開庭審訊。</p>
<p>起訴書提事實　囤購糧食營利</p>
<p>起訴書提出胡氏等之犯罪事實，分爲三項：</p>
<p>（一）購囤糧食營利—胡氏於卅三年九月爲購運軍糧及催收舊欠，在常德成立督徵辦事處，以戴鍾衡主持其事。胡邁乘購運軍糧之便，以採購處內員工食糧爲名，商同戴鍾衡先後購進食穀二萬七千〇八百零六石，其採購方式或向大戶購進，或收購縣級公糧，或係就地配購，多係以撥交軍糧方法兌存常德桃源兩地，除一部計一萬三千餘石，徵用民船上運沅陵，一部六千餘石，在常德變賣外，截至卅四年十二月底止，計桃源尙存穀六千八百餘石，上運沅陵者，陸續在沅出賣。據胡邁，戴鍾衡供稱：無非以預謀處內員工三十四年度一年糧食之需要，及調劑民食爲藉口，然查該處員工食米，原係發給實物。三十四度改發代金，糧食部於三十三年年底始行宣佈，而該處購糧在先何以逆料有發代金之舉，胡邁供稱：私人並未在濱湖路買穀，是福利社買的，實際上該處福利社在耒陽淪陌後，無形解散，迄未合法成立。被吿等購進此批糧食時，每石自四百元至八百六十元，賣出時每石自二千七百五十元至六千元，獲利甚鉅，祗以現在尚有餘額未售，整個營利無從統計。</p>
<p>第二犯罪事實　擅提公欵圖利</p>
<p>（二）侵佔並擅提公款圖利—（甲）查湖南省田糧處前標賣三十二。卅三兩年度地方賦毅，所有代收應解湖南財政　之款，由胡邁提用一千萬元。據供：係移作明德中學建築費，經詳詢明德中學代理校長謝祖堯及該校事務主任，均謂該校並未向省財政廳及雀田糧處借款。（乙）胡邁私人寓所開支公款，列入省田糧處經管帳內，總計四百三十萬元之多，並有電熨斗，亦在公帳開支。（丙）被吿蕭鑄新三十四年八月間，在渝向糧食部領到公款三百萬元，即以一千六百五十元之價格購買美匯圖利。不意後來美匯價値低落，損失頗鉅，乃報由胡邁批示，將此項損失改由福利社負担。</p>
<p>第三犯罪事實　假福利社名義</p>
<p>（三）以福利社爲掩護之各種犯行——（甲）收買加工盈餘　圖利。（乙）利用福利社名義提用公款，經營商業，收買棉花及食鹽專賣。（丙）私人撥兌糧食等綜上所控，胡遭購囤糧食營利，係犯非常時期違反糧食管理治罪暫行條例第四條第一款之罪，假明德中學名義，先後提用公款，犯兩個懲治貪污條例第二條第六款之罪。在經管款內，連續提用公款四百萬元，係犯懲治貪污條例第二條第六款之罪。兩次宴客開支公款三次，以公用汽車供私人使用，又以公款彌補他人非法之損失，犯六個懲治貪污條例第三條第二款之罪，收買加工盈餘穀圖利，犯懲治貧污條例第三條第六款之罪，以「田特戶」名義連續侵佔公款一百餘萬元，犯懲治貪污條例第三條第二款之罪。其他被告蕭鑄新，戴鐘衡，文名鼎，均依懲治貪污條列處罪。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　華僑教育要上坡趕路了</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>過去的華僑敎育，可稱是步步荆棘，令人愧急得要痛哭流涕。僑敎上貽誤事情最多，煩擾人心最甚的，莫過於職權不淸，人人可管而又人人不管，人人不管而又入人爭管。行政機構，有的時設時無，有的雖設等無，有的有頭無腦。國民缺乏僑敎意識，機關請不到專門人才，經費少得使你不能相信，出國巡視的非官非民，派去敎書的心不在焉，受訓的人是醉翁之意不在酒。編了幾十年的敎科書，一本沒有飄洋過，現在尙胭在某館的木箱裏。結果：土生子駡祖國，看不起祖國；潮州人做了內閣大臣，壓迫潮州人；泉州人做了總統，驅逐泉州人！</p>
<p>回首前　，十分難堪。如今國土重光，河山再造，國家民族正在切盼着爲僑胞脫去沉重破爛的舊衣，換上時代稱身的新裝。假使與僑敎直接間接有關係的人，人人從心底裏澈顯澈尾的覺悟，從長期的需夢甦醒過來，懺悔過去，努力將來，立志氣，獻力量，那未僑敎已到了絕對絕對需要展開的緊急關頭，未始以前人家需要華僑，而今人家在排擠僑！倘無健全的敎育，何以培養他們的學問道德智識技能，以資生存，以求發展？智識不平等，是糾紛的主要根源之一。智識平等，可促進民族間互相了解和團結，可實現眞正和平。佛家謂：「一切衆生，皆可成佛」。基督稱：「人皆爲上帝的兒女，是兄弟姊妹」。這關鍵，就在敎育上。僑胞的靈魂出自僑敎的反映，僑敎是建僑保僑的基礎。今天祖國對僑民少年大羣，絕對要求其成爲担當將來僑胞命運的發揮者，同時對僑民成人大羣，也絕對要求其成爲担當目前僑胞命運的維持者。故此後僑敎絕對絕對需要加速進步。舊時代的弊病必須革除，新時代的作風必須要拿出來。屈子曰：「新沐者必彈冠，新浴者必振衣。」乘此還都時節，說一些今後僑敎行政上的改革之道。</p>
<p>（一）職權統一：今日世界是一元世界、哲學上在提倡一元論，科學上在證明一元論。僑敎行政機構是有機體，它的職權，當然不容支離破碎，非統一不可。僑敎行政職權統一的好處說不盡，等於五官四肢生在一個人身上一樣的好。敎育文化事業，海外的該歸僑務機關主管，國內的由敎育機關主管。外交機關則作國內外的聯絡，領事館有負耳目之責。黨部辦黨務，對文敎有見得到的地方，可隨時吿訴主管機關。文敎社團的管理，社會機關與僑務機關亦須國內外的分淸。幸運得很，這個行政問題，已得六全大會議決通過，又獲最近第七三四次行政院會議通過實施。這是僑敎歷史上劃時代的新紀元。此後要看怎樣的做品了。但羅馬不是一天造成的，如今剛是上坡頂吃力的時候呢。</p>
<p>（二）人事和諧：職權旣經劃分，各機關的人事必須力求和諧，力避磨擦·毋以一點小事，形成了極顯著的壁壘，劃下了不可磨滅的鴻溝。磨擦暗鬥，導因於心中存一「我相」。「我相」產生心理不健全，因此誤解誤會益多。假使去「我相」，一切秉公，對另一機關的人做朋友，作澈底的認識，隔膜自去。承認自己有日月之失，承認他人也會有一得之愚。更要緊的設身處地想一想，則彼此相視，胸中何嘗粘着半點兒芥蒂？各人盡本位努力，做到一切活動是爲了僑敎，一切利益先歸諸僑敎。辦行政的人自己要像個樣子，得人家敬重。換句話，今後人人自新，事事進步，無形巾登時增高國家地位，僑敎自會有光輝的前途。</p>
<p>（三）機構加強：主管國內外僑敎的機構必須加强。蛇無頭固不能行，頭壞亦是走不動。人家在天上飛，我們爲什麼一定要老在地下爬？有人謂僑敎機構像老牛拖破車，這種現象，如何可管全世界六十一國的華僑文化事業和敎育？敎育機關該有一個結結實實辦理國內僑敎的機構，並且要有專人主持。國內敎育重要，邊疆敎育重要，回國僑生的敎育何嘗不重要！僑務機關已有的僑民敎育處，宣照第五届執行委員會第七次全體會議通過僑敎方案中擴充敎育處組織，目前的敎育指導科和文化事業科，尙嫌不够勁兒，海外中等敎育，國民敎育，高等敎育，社會敎育，視導工作，乃至調查研究編審，都應該樹起規模來。</p>
<p>（四）經費增加：我們祗知向僑胞伸手討錢，而不知爲僑胞解囊用錢，有人竟謂補助僑民敎育的錢呌作「倒流」。殊不知我們爲僑民用錢，正是向僑民要錢，而且將來可要得更多的錢，天下沒有比這種投資更上算了。事理是很淸楚的。一個人受了敎育，生產能力便增强，財富自然加多，用去一個敎育的錢，賺回的何止千百個錢！僑敎愈普及愈提高，僑胞財富愈多，祖國得到的僑匯自愈水漲船高。僑敎經費數額的原則，該根據國內人口數量與行政支出成正比例，每省人口多少，行政費支出多少的百分比，也該施行於僑民身上，其中至少以百分之二十五用諸於僑敎。僑胞雖不直接納稅，而他們家屬却有稅可納，且僑胞的進出口貿易，國家也有稅可取。何况年有數萬萬的外滙不斷的滾滾流入祖國？欲求僑教辦得有聲有色。第一，海外各地必須設立文化站，必須添辦示範的好學校，並組成世界華僑「文敎網」，由此中心普遍推行。第二，必須有僑敎基金。此種基金，國內外各助半數，分年分區完成，一勞永逸，僑敎才可站得穩。其他欲辦的事情，方興未艾，在在需要經費，否則一切都是落空。</p>
<p>（五）人才愼用：職權劃淸了，經費有着落了，工作可放手做了，這好比去了手銬，但脚鐐猶未去，不容易大踏步走。這個脚鐐是什麼？便是辦事人的庸俗低能。要逢到一個辦僑敎行政的良好科員，簡直是千難萬難。他該懂敎育，熟公事，富思想，有辦法，而更要明白海外僑民實際生活，至低限度要求他是一個中材，是習敎育的人，品性善良，而肯平心靜氣去學。實在僑敎是塊處女地，去開荒的人只要不自棄，人人都有機會成就僑敎專家。在上者對同仁不懷惡意，而注以仁愛的感情，明是非，辨好歹，在下者亦樂於竭其股肱之力。人是事業的中心，人是建設的基本。知人名天下的曾國潘曾說，得人不外四事，曰廣收，愼用，勤敎，嚴繩。現在僑敎範圍還不致於大到廣收地步，而愼用一節，非辦到不可。若能以人才本位而知人善任，碩大的中國不怕沒有好人用。</p>
<p>（六）分區督導：行政機構在國內，教育事業在國外。國外視國內「天高皇帝遠」，呼天天不嚮，呼地地不應。國內視國外，渺渺茫茫，不關痛　，不明善惡。彼此隔膜，如人體血脈之不和，危險孰甚！以我之見，全世界不妨劃分爲十五區至二十區，各區漸次設立僑敎視導專員，常川駐外，管理各種僑教育，而他的主要職務則爲視導，促進敎育，與僑胞·學校·當地政府等通力合作，避免政治活動，避免刺戟外人的一切活動。老實說，我們國內還是一團黑，現在即使將殖民地雙手拱奉給我們，我們還是沒辦法，樂得先把敎育事業埋頭做好，否則弄巧成拙，連得自己本人也一籌莫展。為僑胞選教育大員，當然是一個隆重嚴肅問題，故一定要選得好，不是阿貓阿狗都可以充任。不然，文不對題，何貴乎有此制度？這種敎育大員，一定是研究敎育的第一流人才，具有敎授資格，不特在學術上能領導，道德品格也必須足爲僑胞的模範，同時對國家建國大業，對僑胞前途有了解有熱忱有抱負。他的籍貫，倒也不一定限於粵閩，有時粵閩人去，反多紛爭，倒不如干脆外省人去。</p>
<p>（七）師資培養：主席講：「官吏是建國的工匠；教師更當」爲建國充實優良的人才。」近代敎師特殊地位的哲學基礎，見諸於Alfred　Victor　Oven的「敎育車輪」。他把人民代表敎育車輪的輪緣，譬喻學生爲車軸，敎師是車轂。因爲敎師是控制學生的直接環境，同時又爲人民和行政機關的聯繫者。這個解釋，在僑敎特別有意義。而且海外敎師比國內更緊要。今日師資，實量方面皆不如國內，是以急宜大量培養。培養的地點最好在國外，就地取材，教導方式儘可不同，明中暗裏均可進行，視環境而定。若在國內辦理，問題叢叢：（一）多數人入學動機不在敎書，而在出國遊　升學等等。（二）受居留地政府歧視，不易簽護照，不易進口，甚至不得上岸。（三）旅費浩大，出國手續麻煩，一閣一年半載，不算希奇。（四）學校拒用，甚至有穿通當地政府驅逐出境。（五）有語言不通者，無從敎管小學生。（六）學識才能有反不及當地敎師，出國後實成狼狽。（七）自以爲中央派去，在校居特殊地位，學校受累無窮。（八）時求更調地區，更換學校，辦理不了。（九）常起糾紛，處理不便。（十）訓練後無機會經常的師範學校，師範班，夜間或暑期師資講習班，短期師資講習所，乃至函授師校，均可進行。我主張大部分敎師該在海外訓練，必要時小部分由國內訓練。外國人看「訓練」不慣，我們不妨用「講習」減少刺戟。</p>
<p>（八）教材編印：教材是民族的經騐，包括着教科書和補充材料等，海外較國內特別重要。我們要有敎育權，可是不能因我們的敎育標而侵犯人家的敎育權。世界各國及其屬地，都要保障他們的敎育權。所以條約上花言巧語訂得「敎育自由」，骨子裏花樣甚多，地方上依然有層出不窮的法令條例，縛手縛脚。權旣握在人手裏，則手可鬆可緊；法又無絕對標準，則尺度也就張弛不定。法之外可有情，則情更是冷暖無常，範圍一乏就可干步到意想不到的地方。有的國家有的地方，明目張胆，由法律規定不准外人設校，於是僅能在晚上開學，作補習的性質。因爲各地環境不同，敎材不得不異。所以我們不能單編一套敎科書，應該因地制宜，分址和內容均須變化，而國文。國史。本國地理·和公民，是萬萬缺少不了的。最近小學課程標準委員會議決將社會包括公民史地，在國外爲着重計，各科目仍須分設，不得已時宜以常識來包容它們，但教學時間仍應維持分科時的數量。寫教材，要根據課程標準；課程是母親，教材是兒子。目前我們卻在　倒做，先有兒子，慢有母親。今後海外各地課程，亦應亟亟動手了</p>
<p>（九）立案指導：立案就是上軌道。僑校利案，不特是上了軌道，而且對祖國增添了向心力。如今僑校立案的，不過百分之十五，好好地要指導他們，吿訴他們立案的好處，不立案的壞處，母打官腔，找學校麻煩。這次國民大會海外某處代表說，他們辦一所學校，已歷三十五年、學生四五百人，辦了十年，立案還沒有辦好，原因是不合官式。此後立案的手續和表格，千萬要簡化，標準要放低。以前規定的基金，在國內原是一種騙局，學校暫時借來一筆款存放銀行，以摭掩調查人的耳目。調查人明知是一個騙局，眼開眼閉的敷衍過去了。我以爲與其作不到，不如不作，只求校董會健全，校長肯捐棄其一生一世之一切，獻身於僑敎，對僑胞祖祖宗宗子子孫孫負起責任，足以分擔僑胞命運，已經够資格立案的了—辦事人該牢記，立案的最大宗旨，只是去爭取他們的心。</p>
<p>（十）僑生回國：獎勵生回國升學，原是希望他們浸潤於祖國環境內，與國內青年共同生活，受祖國文化洗禮，成爲祖國化。將來他們回到原居留地，以祖國爲本位，藉此改善僑胞生活，提高僑胞地位，溝通國內外的情感。常他們回國時，要有得力的指導，否則下壞印象，比不回國更壞。往昔接待所的制度，僑生只有吃穿困覺，無所事事，養成遊手好閒，決非上策。此後通商各岸，特別是上海，宜設「僑生指導所」，予以升學·就業·以生活的種種指導，一面供住宿，一面上課補習。精神上的訓練，品德上的修養，愛國態度的陶冶，人情風俗的講述，萬萬不可漠視。國內大可不必專設華僑中學以養成其特殊心理，反不能與國內學生同甘共苦。戰時的華僑中學，辦得亂糟糟，驅校長，打主任，不成體統，今後絕對絕對不允許再長此下去了。回國升大學的僑生，尤應分散各大學，切忌集中於一個學校。他們有些功課跟不上國內，就可在僑生指導所內補習，或指定若干大學設班敎學，及格後立即分發。先修班制度如再繼續。也可負此補習責任。</p>
<p>右陳各點，不過是犖犖大者，其中尤以人事最迫切，一人總應當一人之用。現在是做事的時代，民主的時代，職權分明的時代。做得不好，權責淸楚，不能像以前的諉卸。報紙可說話，參議機關可說話，大家都可說話。爲祖國，為僑胞，為民的建設，敎非上坡趕路不可了！</p>

<p>編輯先生：滬市保衛團之撤銷，已由喧傳而演成事實。本人自滬市保衛團復員之始，即承乏滬西區團長，荏苒迄今，忽已六月。茲以多數有關係人咸來問詢，願就滬西區團情形，略述梗概，以爲關心者吿。按滬西區域，西南與靑松爲界，西北與嘉寶毗連，扼上海之最邊線，地土廣裏，南北四十里，東南三十里，人口散處，控制極難。滬西區團以九個　隊之實力，分配猶嫌不足。而就警力之配備情形觀察，龍華新涇雖各設分局，但警察人數，僅三四十人，即各派出所如虹橋亦祗十一人，程家橋十一人，諸翟眞如周家橋各十餘人，華漕雖有警察大隊，人數亦不足三十。此外七賓。莘莊·江橋·吳家巷·長橋等處，俱五警察蹤跡。以是匪類混聚，搶劫時間。甚至駐地警所，為避免匪徒刧械威脅，輒不敢置備武器，以苟安姑息者。茲若一旦將保衛團撇銷，此後地方防務，如何處置？實爲最可注意之要點。滬西保衛團成立於去冬，工作展開之後，登記舊有團員，加徵當地優秀青年爲新團員，繼再發給槍械，實施訓練。時常歲暮，奉令協力冬防，經常輪流出動各分隊團員，協助軍警工作。常廢曆年關前後，爲防範奸匪滋擾起見，每日午後六時起，至次日晨六時止，分巡邏預備哨戒三組，不分晝夜，執行防務。匪類因此絕跡，居民賴以安居。這都是過去的實在情形，無容加以誇張或煊染的。本年五月，爲防範不逞份子起見，滬西地區，適當本市之前衛，本團受命協力軍隊担任防衛，集結七寳虹橋眞如北新涇等處。多數團員，犧性其所操職業及精力，担當戒備勤務。爲期雖祗一月，然此種服務精神，彌足欽佩和紀念的。至於保衛團過去餉精問題，照保衛團組織，總團之下設區團，區團下設大隊，大隊下設中隊，中隊直轄各分隊，每處團員少者一分隊—約四十五名，多者一中隊—約一百四十四名。需要給養者，區團及大隊有給官兵（每單位不到十人）以外，每中隊僅副中隊長一名，特務長一名，及團丁六七名而已。此外中分隊長及全體團負，均係義務職。彼等非僅不支薪餉，有時目須墊付開支各款，即如有給官兵之主副食，照規定本年三月份爲每名五千元許，三四五月份雖加至一萬一千元許，然揆諸當前物價，相去甚遠，不足之數，輒由義務中分隊長及熱心之地方人士及義務團員，設法彌補，或全部慨捐。此種特殊情形，豈是普通軍委警機關所能得見？此實彌可資爲紀念及欽佩者。其實保衛團的改編工作，自前保衛團的常備大隊由市警　　察局改編爲保安警察隊以後，可以說已經告一段落。因爲現在所存的保衛團，純係義務性質，又均係正當市民在當地或農或商，個個有着相當職業，衣食於斯，作息於斯，其服務精神，服務自的，完全一致，保衛地方，即保衛自己，守法從命，已入正軌。地方武力之究應保存與否，此亦爲値得考慮之事。按滬市保衛團，歷史攸久，組織純正，其唯一任務，厥爲協力軍警，保護地方。而於一二八，八一三抗敵戰役時，歷有功績，早由姜懷素氏呈準軍委會採列戰史，無用賢述·此次國家勝利，日月重光上海以紳商各界之協力，恢復舊有保衛團，成立保衛委員會，直屬市政府，下設保衛總團，統一指揮辦理，由民辦人於官辦，標明系統，擴大範圍。如能加强訓練，使成勁旅，實爲地方之一環。現在雖是不幸撤銷，本人極希望凡我原任團員，仍舊保持過去精神，繼續輔助地方，共同安定上海，安定家鄉。陳伯良，六月十八日。</p>

<h3>捧湯恩伯</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>湯因伯該捧的事甚多，抗戰期中，從古北口打到貴陽，打了上百次的硬仗，血仗，汗馬功勳，該捧的；勝利後他奉命衛戍上海地區，來到這最複雜的環境，受降遺俘，責任重大，工作繁褥，該捧的；他待人親切和靄，該捧的；有政治氣度，肯虛心研究，該捧的；但我願意特別捧他一件事，那就是他最近派遣了幾十位軍官來滬查究軍人强佔房屋。</p>
<p>勝利後的上海，最初那一段接收混亂的日子，我們今日也無勇氣再談了，以房屋一項而論，許多千奇百怪的方法，為安分良民的我們所難以想像的。直到現在為止，這筆糊塗賬還是無法淸算。</p>
<p>其中，不可否認的，不許多不肖軍人的敗行壞紀。湯恩伯雖然離開上海，第三方面軍的番號雖然撤消，但是，他對於此等情事決未擱在一邊，裝聾作啞，這是値得我們擁護，値得我們謳歌的。</p>
<p>據說：該批軍官抵滬後，即通知所屬，除前准所居民產日僑房屋四十四幢可繼續居住外，其餘所佔七十餘幢，應立即勒令遷出，凡有强佔民房者，將予嚴辦。</p>
<p>湯恩伯治軍素嚴，又有「殺星」之稱，相信不會有人拿自己的頭顱開玩笑罷；所可惜者，直到此刻為止，祗有湯將軍一個人這樣的身體力行，所以，我在這里特別願意稱頌他！</p>
<h3>印緬前綫回憶</h3>
<p>— 菊影</p>
<p>一，「上帝造人難」</p>
<p>勝利前一年當中英美盟軍密切配合下；向着那緬北原始地帶——野人山前時時候，正是五月的鮮花開遍了原野。印度雷多機塲羣聚着成千成萬的中國駐印軍隊，他們都是輕便裝束，終日蜷伏在機塲的一角，躲在雨衣架成的帳幕底下。像等候裁判員銀笛的球員一樣，他們期待着上級的命令。這樣的生活，他們一連已過了有一個多星期了。</p>
<p>一天，駐印總部的一位美國高級將領，突然降臨到我們無聊軍人的面前，來向這些渴望任務已久的中國弟兄訓話：</p>
<p>「各們親愛的中國英雄們，現在地面的部隊，已經快到了密支那的近郊。你們馬上便得由飛機空運到那裏去，强迫降落，協同地面友軍攻取該城。多麼神聖的任務呵！已經光榮地落在你們的肩上，我除了向你們慶幸外，還有一個至誠的忠告。必須要我來告訴你們。那就是：毫不　息武器，絕對尊重生命。因為，造一支步槍，只需要幾秒鐘，造一門大砲，只要十幾秒鐘，造一架飛機，也不過半分鐘。可是上帝造一個人呢！却至少要二十年！」說到這裏，機塲裏的隆隆馬達聲，被淹沒在千萬張口的狂呼聲中。</p>
<p>二，印度打油詩</p>
<p>中國駐印軍生長在遙遙的外國，他們不但改變了农食住行的習慣，就是他們的興致也隨着活潑的美利堅人而轉移了。</p>
<p>某日黃昏；我散步在某軍營之側，偶拾得一丘八所作的打油詩，其詞曰</p>
<p>「化大媽大敬禀者，兒在外面頂頂好，牛肉罐頭阿脚海，兩脚要大頭要小。」</p>
<p>「化大媽大」是印語的雙親大人，「阿脚海」是印語「頂好」的意思。第四句需要解釋。英國裝不適宜中國人穿着，遠征軍中不乏四川人，四川人的個子尤其小。發下來的皮鞋，皆是大的多。而帽子是船型帽，一般人又嫌小。</p>
<p>這種打油詩也許可以和上海的洋涇濱歌訣媲美罷。</p>
<p>三，「頂好」的來源</p>
<p>到過後方的人皆知盟軍見國人即呼「頂好」，其來源各說不一，我聽說的如下。</p>
<p>自日寇發動了太平洋攻勢後，印度支那半島上的日軍以迅雷不及掩耳之勢向北疾進，連軸緬甸的首府——曼德勒，也很快地淪落敵手。那時在緬甸的軍隊，除了英印者外，還有一支當年赫赫聞名的中國第五軍。他們在那裏佈置了一個袋形陳地，準備放開袋口捉老鼠，孰知事非人料，敵人倒沒有跑進袋口，却插入了代的底部，以致國軍至雲南的交通綫被截，而不得不向印度退却。</p>
<p>這個時候，英國有一支精銳的裝甲兵團，在燕南（譯音）地方為少數輕裝急進的日軍所包圍。他們在那個包圍圈內戰戰兢兢地等待上帝的判處。結果，在他們恐怖生活的十幾天後，一支中國軍隊將他們解圍。這就是新三十八師的一個步兵營。因為日本人根本就很少，所以在零星的幾串流彈下，便達成了這個任務。</p>
<p>可是，那些被困已久的可憐英國軍人，這樣得慶更生，喜出望外。他們丟棄了一切，只曉得朝着印度方向奔跑，在路上一撞到中國弟兄，就伸起了大拇指，高呼「頂好」，從此「頂好」便成了盟軍間的一個口頭禪了。</p>
<p>晚上對步哨的回答，在中國人是「OK」，在英美人的回答，那就是「頂好」。「頂好」頂頂好」「頂頂頂頂好」。這就看美國人高興的程度來加重這「好」的比較級。可是現在呼「頂好」的人，也許很少有知道這是一種感激的聲音吧！</p>

<h3>香港手</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>香港脚是一種皮膚病，生於脚趾縫裏，奇癢難熬，頑不可治。在香港名是「香港脚」，從英文Hongkong　foot而來，其實這種病症不是香港所專有；就中國而論，長江以南的地帶殆普遍於都市的人們，統稱之為濕氣。據說酒喝多了就會有的，然而不喝酒的人而患些症的也所在多有，實不限於酒客為然。</p>
<p>香港脚又名運動脚，病的起原來自美洲，美洲以前的大學生和愛運動的人，據說多害此病。此病祗有顯癢而已，正如中國人所謂「癬疥之疾」，未足致命，但癢起來時可就够你受了。然也有因此而得到一種性慾的陶醉。原來浴堂裏有「刮脚」，「揑脚」兩種技巧，患這病的人就這一「刮」，一「揑」，其樂趣眞不可形容呢！不過這種「刮」和「揑」，也有它的害處的。就是此病經了一「刮」或者一「揑」之後，其勢便會擴大起來，說不定會擴大至使你步履維艱，痛癢萬狀。</p>
<p>我自從離開了學校以來，這種病就與我相依為命了。但我很喜歡有了它，因為有了它，不容易害別的病；假如有了別的病，它也不再與我纏綿，銷聲匿跡，直至別的病完了，纔又出頭露面。這點，可知它的性子的悠長，也可以想見這病之不容易根治。</p>
<p>可是，這病之附在我的身上，多年業祗只佔有幾條脚趾縫而已，後來到了南京，便擴至左右手的掌手上。一切慣用的藥都失了效果，其而敷了慣用的藥，其勢更加蔓延，益且加劇，足足在鼓樓醫院裏治療了十多個星期，還是那麼濕漉漉地滴出水來，又癢又疼（癢時不能不搔，搔了便疼撤心肺）。日日給鼓樓醫院的外科醫生把兩用用繃布層層包紥，失去運用。當時有一位朋友說我是道地的拳術家，日日在準備角鬥，其實我那時幾乎連精神上的痛苦也難以再熬了。好容易挨到了冬天，兩手始平復過來，實則又回到脚趾縫去而已。</p>
<p>不料轉移到了香港，為了水土不宜，竟至於連手帶脚一齊發作，不祗疼癢，而且每一粒水泡都起上了膿，要手足高高擱起，纔能略减痛苦。經過了三個月的醫治，始稍稍能够起步，但也要一步一拐而行，不能快走，在人地生疏的地方，害的是這種的病症，眞是痛苦萬分。及至到薄扶林道轉過學士台去看張光宇，却原來他竟與我同病相憐，連脚的背部也腫了起來，但他能够每日走到星島日報去辦公，總沒有如我的厲害。</p>
<p>八九年來它已安份了許多，老在趾縫之間潛伏，但其他的病却接踵而至，人總是浸淫在藥裏裏頭，任是如何翻騰也逃不出一個病字。但也可幸的是久病知醫，能够自己把命延長，　到了長期抗戰的勝利。這總算不虛此一生了。想不到，為了久病知醫的關係，這些日子的香港脚又變成了香港手了。起初是掌堂上癢癢地起上幾粒水泡。繼而是一串一串的連珠，再則是一簇一簇如像葡萄了。這苦悶，這疼癢，任誰也難於忍受。終則全部水泡潰破下來，水，黃澄澄地如泉湧起，拭之不竭，癢更變本加厲地如蛇行蟻攢。要是實劍在手，眞不難將之一揮呢！可惜我是沒有「壯士斷臂」的勇氣。</p>
<p>這日許是天赦日罷，蝸居裏來了一位久不曾見面的余啓江先生。他本來有了「黃陸」的名頭，然而治這種病症却有了洪滐的經騐。他審視一回我兩掌的患處，便無言地走出門去替我配了一大瓶藥水，好幾個「安士」的藥膏。回來時忙吩咐傭人取上一盤開水來，把瓶裏的藥水倒下四分之一，拿起鉗子，鉗着一些藥水棉花，頻頻拂拭我兩掌上的患處。說也奇怪，才一醮上，奇癢立止；這樣經過了好多分鐘，一俟開水的熱度降低了，便把我的兩掌一齊浸了進去，患處益發舒服起來，那裏還覺到有甚濕氣。他又把我掌上新起來未破的水珠用剪子全數剪去了皮膚，告我再浸在水內，一直至水的溫度冷透了為止，再替我敷上藥膏，也不包紥，可我已連眉頭也不縐了。</p>
<p>我從藥膏的盒蓋上獲知那是「蠄蟝膏」，但藥水不知名，問余啓江，他却微笑不答，祗說，「包你四天全瘉。」果然，四天過後，腐皮盡褪，從出新膚；要是不再復發的話，我這「相依為命」的「香港手」，恐怕從此要和我絕緣吧！</p>
<p>美國感覺糧荒，亦如其他各地。紐約有不少肉舖因不得物品而歇業。團示許多家庭主婦于一肉舖前排隊等候購物。他們還是較幸運的哩！</p>
<h3>美國二房江</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>出租條件：</p>
<p>要義務照顧他的孩子</p>
<p>全世界都有黑市，全世界都鬧房荒，就是美國也不例外。政府的「物價管理局」，費盡了苦心，但是，商人和房東自有他的噱頭。</p>
<p>比如，政府訂出了公寓房租的限價，然而有的房東硬要把舊傢俱賣給你。三套舊傢俱，竟賣到一千二百元美　。</p>
<p>有一套三間的公寓，月租六十五元，可說是公平合理了，房東要先付後住。另外還要付花園修理費，每月十五元。</p>
<p>所謂花園，是城外二十哩的一小塊草地，他租是每年一塊錢。這個房東共有十家房客，他每年非法收一千八百元的「花園修理費。」</p>
<p>有的地方，公寓租屋經理，要房客送一百塊錢的禮物，才租得到房子，有的房東，要房客交換一輛汽車。</p>
<p>最奇怪的是，有一個地方的房東，要房客每星期，給他義務照管六天小孩，因為他妻子是一個職業婦女。</p>
<h3>强盜新聞</h3>
<p>— 廢仲</p>
<p>「盜亦有道」，古有明訓。「論强盜之類」雖不能寫成好文章，想也不致觸犯禁章；而况眼前看到了三則新聞，由不得你不提起筆來，書其所感。</p>
<p>第一則是一月前的地方通訊：强盜打劫輪船，招呼三位掛着公務員證章的乘客，「朋友！不要慌，咱們一樣窮，決不打擾你們。」此輩强盜即便非公務員出身，却能深知公務員之苦，那班苛待公務員者，豈非連强盜都不如？</p>
<p>第二則是某大王出綁回鄕，談歷險經過，謂：「綁匪中看守的人，有一個有初中程度，能讀靑城十九俠，雖流為匪徒，意志猶未全泯，如若他能跟我做事，我極願提拔他。」這足以表示某大王的「寬大為懷」；然而沒有出路的中學生很多，讀靑城十九俠的綁匪，不過是千萬分之一，某大王獨加垂青，於社會又能裨益多少？不過脫險歸來，旣能捐款救濟難胞，又能念念不忘提翠後進，（雖只限於匪窟的看守者）某大王由此次不幸事情中下救人的決心，也就彌足珍貴了。</p>
<p>第三則是魚市場經理家刦案破獲，盜首為敎員出身，敎員作强盜，這更不足為怪。須知敎員做强盜亦有其定理可循。豈不知「誤人子弟，男盜女娼」的格言早有流傳。現任敎員與其為生活煎迫者，無心執敎而誤人子弟，何如直截做了强盜？否則還要等而下之，在妻女身上想財路嗎？</p>
<p>綜觀三則新聞，結論又是古之明訓：「衣食足而後知榮辱」罷。</p>
<h3>摩根斯蒂納小姐為挪威駐美大使之愛女，又為挪威小姐，現選為一九四六年聯合國小姐。按參加競選者有四十一國之美麗女郎。選舉時之大跳舞會來賓一千五百人，轟動華府外交及社交界。</h3>

<h3>明查暗訪　猜測竟成事實？</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>分配各機關房屋委員會，因日僑遺留空屋，頗多為軍人佔住，無法分配，頗感棘手，據說曾分電首都陸海空軍最高當局暨第三方面軍，希望迅予調查，勒令遷讓。現在湯司令官已派員來滬，嚴密調查執行了，可是首都軍事當局似乎迄尚未有動靜，一般人對此均認為詫異；或謂有「明查」，必有「暗訪」，說不定已在察訪之中。一旦查明，則以閃電姿態出現，嚴厲執行，使對方措手不及，豈不更妙。此雖猜測之詞，但願竟成事實。</p>
<p>舞女登記截至本月二十日止已有一千五百餘名。據調查統計：「此輩舞女皆以經濟困難為伴舞理由，渠等多不識字，曾肄業小學者十不得一，中學程度者鳳毛麟角」。下面似乎應加一小注曰：「但是多會講一兩句洋涇浜」。</p>

<p>自吳市長嚴厲管制食糧後，半月來米糧行市，果然非常平穩，升斗小民，額手稱慶，但望當局終始不懈，嚴加看管，務使「老虎」再也跳不出　來。</p>

<h3>海外短播</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>丁莫生柯本來是蘇聯紅軍中的紅將，但是，到了後來竟成為了「被遺忘的人」，在報紙上難得找到他的大名了。最近他已被任為蘇聯的駐阿比西尼亞大使。丁氏是著名的防禦戰略家，但却不是卓越的政界人材。這件事頗引起英美政界的注意。</p>
<p>蘇聯名將巨哥夫元帥，和美國參謀總長艾森豪威爾私交甚篤，兩人常有書信往來。</p>
<p>美國宣傳專家正計劃在柏林試演「大獨裁者」，先預備挑選一批觀衆試看，以測騐德國觀衆對這位笑匠的傑作，是否會滿堂哄笑。</p>
<p>戰後美國罷工迭起，汽車業，鋼鐵業，煤礦和鐵道工作的大罷工，震動世界。損失之大，不可計數。據六月十日出版之「新聞周刋」所載，一九四六年，最初四個月的罷工損失了七千零二十萬個工作日。</p>
<p>生產量的損失是空前的：一百零六萬輛汽車沒有造成，九百萬噸煤沒有開採，一百三十萬噸鋼沒有煉成，鉛的產量减低百分之六十，鋼的產量跌落百分之七十五。</p>
<p>罷工的損失，直接波及國外。例如，義大利的煤全靠美國輸入，因此，它的復興計劃，大大地打入折扣。　饉的歐洲損失了好幾百萬噸的食物。</p>
<p>美國政府正在考慮，全國普遍實施日光節約時間，以減少煤的消耗。此外，今年冬天，美國也許要採煤斤配給制。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯認為龐大的佔領軍，是經濟復興的障礙，因此，也是和平的障礙，他認為，這並不是必要的。他說，一百萬名十八歲的美國兵，在街道上走來走去，並不能保證德國澈底解除武裝。必須請卓越的科學家，工程師，自始至終的監視德國解除武裝，隨時報告各盟首都。他認為，小量的，流動的部隊，隨時可出動到出事地點，倒是更為合式的，同時可以利用空軍及空運部隊。</p>

<p>電影与戲劇</p>
<h3>上海話劇總評之三</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>七·「紅樓夢」</p>
<p>這劇原名「鬰雷」劇作者在劇中點題是：像秋天的悶雷，雖然是在響着，但是不會有雨，也不會有霹靂的．又說：像一個人有好多話要說，但不能說出口，永遠在嗓子里似的。這次「鬱雷」在上海演出，改名爲「紅樓夢」，因爲「鬱雷」是舊名小說「紅樓夢」中的一段改編而成的。所以用「紅樓夢」來代替「鬱雷」也未嘗不可！</p>
<p>在劇作改編中，有很多地方要靠小說的帮助。假使一個沒有着過紅樓夢小說的人，先在這裏看戲，他將會摸不淸頭腦的。一個已經讀過紅樓夢小說的人，那麼，他對劇作中的許多漏洞會毫不注意地讓他過去而對劇作認爲滿意。在劇作中，賈寳玉和林黛玉的情感可以在幾次香袋糾紛中看出，但是賈寳玉的見了姐姐忘了妹妹，愛跟女孩子梳梳頭之類的，愛情並未在劇中表現出來，又如林黛玉的氣量小，光從薛寳釵送一點東西來引起林黛玉的愁，作爲表示性格是無理由的；用香袋糾紛來表示也是不够的。關於薛寳釵的度量大，在劇中沒有看出，並不是說演員，而是在這演出的劇作裏。同時，她在劇中和賈寳玉的戲，到結婚才開始；在這之前，她幾乎沒有和賈寳玉講過一句話。所以，我們無從看出薛寳釵的性格和她對寳玉的情感。假使說她完全是一個陌路人也未嘗不可，但在結婚一塲中，寳釵明明喊出：「寳玉」這名字。從這裏可以看到她們不是不認識的。</p>
<p>在全劇中寫得最多的倒是紫鵑，劇作人把她寫得很好，很恰富，很動人，也很金適。她幾乎是貫串了全劇，她侍候黛玉，哄騙寳玉，爲寳釵而陪嫁。從頭到尾，只有紫鵑能代表出；因爲她了解雙方的情感，眼看到雙方的轉變。其他一些人物，如寳玉：他只知道一面，黛玉則在後半段戲中就沒有，寳釵是斷斷續續的。因此我說這戲最重要的人物是紫鵑而不是寳玉，黛玉，更不是寳釵了。惟可惜的：寳玉臨出門時，紫鵑在塲而不能一訴觀衆所喜聽的話，使觀衆心中的悲感得到一個疏散的機會。</p>
<p>這劇的主題，除了舊式婚姻荼毒兒孫，主張婚姻自由外，簡直找不出一點別的什麼。如紅樓夢中所描寫的榮寗二國府中的腐敗情形，在這劇裏一點也找不出來。這一點是可原諒劇作改編者的，因爲他題名爲「鬱雷」就是他最好的解釋理由。</p>
<p>劇作者爲文說明，這完全不是紅樓夢他寫這劇的目的是在寫人性靈的解放。這一點，除了寳玉出家當和尚外，無別的可證明，那麼，這一點還是紅樓夢上的。我想：劇作者所以要這樣說，是在掩護他劇中改編的不到處。</p>
<p>劇中配音，是用的中國音樂，　　是否配得正確和合適可留　專家們去批評，但我覺得這音樂和台上的佈景，演員身上那些古色古查的服裝，在情調上都很一致。</p>
<p>全劇之中，我個人最喜歡最後一幕的氣氛，它使人感到一點憂愁的調子，宏亮面單調的鐘聲，可以說是一個力量，但並不完全靠它，劇作，導演，演員等的力量，在這裏當然沒有白費。</p>
<p>八，「鷄鳴早看天」</p>
<p>「鷄鳴看天」是洪深先生最近寫的劇本，這劇本比他過去的一些要完整得多。但在這劇裏我們可以看到劇作者把政治民主化只常作口號喊，並沒有把它滲進劇情裏去，因此他就成了一件外衣，而不是劇中的主幹。整個的劇情，只是幾段零星的故事穿插而成的。爲了這樣，使這劇的度量失去深刻，顯得浮淺。</p>
<p>在大後方，幾條公路上的汽車夫，後來統一名稱呌司機，他們這一帮人是非常複雜的，智識水準高一點的，可能有些是大學生；水準低一點的，就一字不識。技術水準的高低也有很大的差別，有些是駕駛老手，坐在他車上旣快又穩決不出毛病，有些剛學會駕駛，一不小心就車子翻車。有些司機每到一處休息，只在吃晚飯時喝點酒就睡覺，有些得呌一個姑娘作伴；更有些了不起的，在一條公路上接了四五個家，隨你汽車歇那兒，他都能到家裘去享受。這種事在「馬達一響，黃金萬兩」的時候，不算一回事的。這「鷄鳴早看天」中所有的人物，都是被司機楊時興載來的，因此有了這故事。這位司機花他們這一階層裏，並不是一個頂好的人，也不是一個頂壞的人。他玩妓女，但他並不苛刻妓女。他帶黃魚，但是不過份的超過定額，像這一類司機還該算好的呢！</p>
<p>其次的一個人物，是妓女王桂芳，這是一個可憐虫。在小縣城裏很容易給我們看到，這一類意志薄弱和無意識的墮落者。她們大多數是被生活所迫！所謂甘心墮落，只是紙醉金迷環境中闊家庭裏的少奶奶和小姐們才有的事。她，王桂芳，一個已經墮落了的下等妓女；她只使我很可憐，而不使我們討厭，她只使我們覺得她貧家，而不使我們感到她庸俗。這兩個人物—楊時興和王桂芳是謝管和罷玲演的，他們所表現的性格，正是劇中所刻劃出的人物性格。全劇中　　　，最鬼計多端的人物林先生。因爲想佔據別人的妻女，去揭發別人的錯誤，吿發對方是漢奸，沒想到他自己也因漢奸罪而被人家拘留了起來。結果是興客棧主衝突而受傷。這一個人物，應該是多麼地有變化。而演員只是平平地，淡淡地，使這性格埋歿在這低能的演按裏，是多麼的可惜啊！</p>
<p>九·「魂歸離恨天」</p>
<p>道是一本改編本。原著是十九世紀英國埃米莉白郞蒂和夏綠蒂白郞蒂姐妹倆的成功作，我國有梁實秋的翻譯本。後來佛勞倫斯奧立佛和曼爾奧白郞合演的電影片「魂歸離恨天」就是根據這小說改編的，這次上演劇本大槪是根據電影改編的。</p>
<p>站在一個改編者的立塲上，大多數都是對別人的作品認爲特別滿意，或是有特別舞台效果可收，才去下功夫改編。决不會因爲這東西寫得太壞了，讓我來替他改編成一部名作的話，爲了這樣，我們總是把名作當作改編的藍本，旣改成後，其價值是否還保持其原來的準繩，是很成問題的。若能超過，那就更了不起了。像莎士比亞那樣，能把別人那些不成材的東西變成萬世不朽的名著，是絕無僅有的事。這劇的改成，也不能逃出這一命運。</p>
<p>在改編上最可責證的一點，就是使薩玲子肚裏有了賀剛的孩子。因爲這樣一來，使高貴的情感變成低劣的肉慾。更醜惡的是有了三個月身孕還結婚，以致發生流產使孩子送掉小命，這些，也許是劇作人當時沒有想到，而他只想到如何加强薩玲子和賀剛的感情，所以產生這樣的後果。</p>
<p>在演出上，雖然前後氣氛不統一，但很明顯地可以看出，薩玲子這一演員給了它很火的帮助，使氛圍更濃厚，更成爲一個悲劇。同時，也能使我們感覺到的是內心的悲哀變成了外形的傷感。</p>
<p>假使我們把氛圍推在一邊不談。那麼，這劇以薩玲子的結婚劃一條線。我們就可看出她婚前是如何的快樂和活潑；婚後是如何的痛苦和消沉。這些可以使我們知道：她是爲了什麼才這樣的。</p>
<p>演員中以演薩玲子的上官雲珠最好，至少她沒有使這性格流落於平淡中，在任何演出裏，我們最怕的是演員演技的平凡和無起伏。他們應該應用演技使一個人物性格活龍活現出現在舞台上才對！否則，這些所謂男女演員就該被逐下舞台！</p>
<p>以上三劇都是由新美劇團在華戲院演出的。若以三劇的演出水準來說：無疑的該是「紅樓夢」。</p>

<h3>新片批評　戰地情侶</h3>
<p>— 迂夫</p>
<p>這不是一部胡鬧的美國片，而是一部比較有意義的片子。它是描寫一個美國音樂家被蘇聯藝術委員會聘去，在蘇聯國境內到處演奏，很受蘇聯人民歡迎。這時，他認識了一個蘇聯女孩子，因爲一夜漫游意（斯科而發生了愛情，終於結了婚。婚後遂雙雙到處演奏。不料德軍攻蘇，長驅直入。女因念家，乃辭夫歸鄉。因戰事不利，將波及女家鄉。這位美國音樂家見妻去而不返，遂求得通行証前去尋妻，路上又遇敵機轟炸，經過很多困難才到女家，見房屋已轟倒，老丈人也被炸死，復見敵機掃射，把他一位蘇聯小朋友射死。這時敵軍將到，全村人民把田野中的稻子全都燒掉，組織游擊隊準備和敵人作戰。音樂家約翰梅狄許和他妻子娜迪安也要加入游擊隊。但他們希望這夫妻倆能回美國去，把這情形告訴美國人，使美國人援助他們。於是他們就回美國爲了蘇聯而演出盛大的音樂演奏會。</p>
<p>這是勞勃泰勒和蘇珊碧德絲二人主演，尚不能說太壞，但是，在這片子中的蘇聯情調並不濃厚，只有的翰和娜迪安結婚，使村民跳舞一場，　使人感到這地點像在蘇聯和　人在跳舞，其他只有一些蘇聯街道的景像。不過，這已經不是一件容易事，因他離開那些胡鬧的距離已很遠。</p>
<p>錯便錯在監製和導演，他們應該在事先非常明瞭卡萊的個性與演技，他是不是最適合此劇，如果不是而須要用他主演的話，那最簡單是應該多加「他那一型」的戲，以便使他發揮天才，同時使這戲大大生色。或者甚至於請編劇的爲了卡萊將此劇修改否則的話，他們就不該請卡萊！已經用了卡萊，那麼，那個小孩演戲雖也不壞，但是導演還缺少研究；因爲卡萊是適；誇張性的喜劇，爲了卡萊，那小孩應該把他換得更矮一些，如果能用少年邨中那名小胖子過來那一定會有更好的效果。</p>
<p>我對於該戲的寫劇與取意都相當贊成，但是我不同意其負責人的隨意挑人，隨意拍戲。</p>
<p>演員方面卡萊還海稱職，小孩不壞，珍妮白蘭在此還是一名剛露頭角的小演員，無好壞可言。</p>
<h3>卓別麟新作問世</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>一代笑匠却利。卓別麟（Charlie　Chaplin）已久遠銀壇，近據電訊云：卓別麟已於本年六月一日起開始拍攝另一新作，該新作原名「藍鬚」“Bluebeard”，近已改名「謀殺者之喜劇」“Conedy　Ｍurderes”，仍由卓氏自導自演，並預定於十個月內完成，卓氏製片素以審慎聞名，該片之攝製時間未逾一年，以其本人從影來之歷史言之，亦可以說是破天荒第一遭呢！想必來年百花怒放之時，全世界之影迷又可以在銀幕上重睹此一代笑匠了。</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」“The　Great　Dictator”爲日美戰爭未發生前卓氏之作品（該片至今尚未在滬放映，上海觀衆一致認爲遺憾），自「大獨裁者」至該新作開拍，卓氏已息影六載，此六年中聞卓氏私生活之變化甚多，卓氏年齒雖已漸高，唯在好萊塢仍是風流不减當年呢！</p>
<h3>「遙遠的愛」故事</h3>

<p>民國十八年冬蕭敎授在靑年會堂講演，引起其愛人朱曼麗不滿，遂不別而行。嘗見狀，即匆匆結東講詞追出，朱乃向　提出訂婚條件。蕙無奈斷然　來。</p>
<p>蕭敎授家娘姨阿珍在洗晒衣服，車夫上前調戲她，她抗拒因而兩人打架，　聞　出，斥之，車夫誣阿珍偷米，經吳亞男中辯，始釋疑。</p>
<p>蕭朱訂婚日，新娘不到，蕭遂宣布與朱又决裂，並要創造一個理想的妻。是晚蕭發現阿珍在偷看書。遂以阿珍爲創造對象。蓋敎授天天替阿珍上課，並受社交訓練及體態禮節。</p>
<p>一次阿珍上樓，就敎于吳，適值吳室內舉行座談，阿珍聽得一男子在爲被壓迫婦女作呼籲，吳又談及阿珍的遭遇，阿珍大爲感動。</p>
<p>老父來吿，阿珍之兄已被捕人獄。阿珍大慟倒入老父懷中，痛哭不止。數日後，其兄來辭行，謂不願爲牛馬，决意當兵打日本！</p>
<p>一二八戰事發生，阿珍父兄因之犧牲，彼本入經過改造，巳非昔比，近正忙于參加看護班，爲受傷抗日戰士服務。</p>
<p>于途中見阿珍輿李　羣在一起，頓起妒忌而尾隨之。突爲羣衆遊行衝散，　遂一人孤獨回家。</p>
<p>在醫院中把阿珍找回，李來訪，　拒絕，吳因而輿蕭爭吵，珍來送出，對着之態度失望而痛哭。</p>

<p>蕭敎授遂于慶祝生日中宣布與朱曼麗結婚，並說阿珍經改造後已超過其本人了。</p>
<h3>想入菲菲</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>卡萊葛倫已往的片子給人的印象總是「喜劇人物」，像不久前在國泰上映的「瘋在世家」那樣。但，這部「想入非非」，就充全不是那麼一回事了。</p>
<p>這劇以卡萊和一小孩爲主角，故事是關於一只小毛蟲的事情，新聞記者的自作聰明，與科學家的一一是一，對人類的自私都有很深刻的飄刺。沒有戀愛故事，所以在戲的格調，說來是相當高的。</p>
<p>卡萊飾自私的人類之一，論其個性似欠相合，祗有小孩在後面跟着吹口琴，和他拿了一鞋盒子眼睛望小孔中張着的一段才看出是卡萊的戲，其他各處都感到並不十分使人滿意，好像他不該道樣的做戲，是演技的不行嗎？不是，他在另一方面：像「瘋狂世家」，「多妻秘史」的演技就發展得特別高，像一座尖山一樣，所以他能在廣告上用特別大的名字便是一個最好的證據。現在這部「想入非非」則是在他尖山之外的戲路，所以他演來有些格格不相入，不能使人十分滿意。一個演員不一定要有多方面的個性；沒有多方面的個性不一定便是失敗；祗要他有某一方面的超人演技，那還是會受多數人的崇拜和讚揚。卡萊便是那一種人。</p>

<p>（四）殘感現象</p>
<p>人目網膜授巴神經受刺激後，必待其興奮傳抵中樞始生視覺。此一傳達時間，名爲視覺潛伏時間。此潛伏時間之長短，須視所見物象及個人視力差而別。如赤色入目十分之一秒時僅辦爲灰色，時間稍久，則辨爲黃爲橙，及至百分之一至二三十之間，乃見某本色。</p>
<p>視覺之起，旣須經過潛伏時期，感覺以後，亦非立即消失，如見火焰如輪，兩脚如線，此皆爲幾感之現象。在色彩方面，如赤黑旋轉變爲　，黑白相混成爲灰。光度愈强，潛伏時間愈短。色彩愈冷，殘感愈長。通常白色殘感約爲十分之七八秒，黃爲千分之八三秒，赤色爲千分之九六秒，靑色最長爲十分之一二二秒。又人目瞥受强光閉目以後，自靑紫綠赤之積極殘象而歸於消極之黒象。由此亦說明殘惑現象亦因各色光波長短而長短。</p>
<p>由殘感而引起的色象，稱爲補色。如凝視赤色後移目他處，乃見靑綠補色。學者對於補色殘象之解釋，以爲感亦時，網膜感赤之部份則起化學分解之作用，先時漸强，而逐漸以弱，迨移目灰白色物時，本應赤靑綠之種視神經皆起作用，乃赤色之視神經旣經無力，故其餘之靑綠感優越，遂見靑綠色彩之殘象。</p>
<p>補色殘象，影響於後來之色覺，其力亦有强弱之殊。如赤綠之誘導力較强，靑黃紫較弱。又飽和之色力最强，不飽和及暗色較弱。設計佈景與攝製彩色電影者，幕與幕之色相更換與鏡頭與鏡頭之色相更換，便須注意補色殘象所給予次一鏡頭之影響。必如此上一鏡頭之補色殘象加實際所用之色相。—始能等於你設計之某正確色相。</p>
<p>同時，補色殘象在兩色降接時，復能影響兩色接述處之色相變化，如赤紫並置，赤色則微帶橙，紫色則微帶靑。設計者欲使色與色分劃明顯，中間最好能夾以補色綫條，中國古裝設計之用金綫，亦在使兩色相之絕對明顯也，欲使色與色之柔和，中間則應夾以間色。或同色而以飽和程度分之。</p>
<p>補色殘象用於投影，貝叔爾脫曾有一種實騐：用普通平面鏡一面，於微離鏡面處，掩上色彩不太濃之色玻板一片，用强烈之泛光投上、再於鏡前斜立鉛筆一支，則見投影有二，一爲補色，一爲玻板之色。此二色分離可見。若仿此種裝置，使映種種景物於天幕，則美麗複影之裝飾，當在無窮發展之意中。</p>
<p>（五）色彩的對比</p>
<p>懂得視覺的殘感現象，便客易懂得色彩對比的原因</p>
<p>色彩的對比，不但在圖案學中負着特殊的價值，在繪　中，在舞台人面化裝上，以及在服裝及舞台佈景之設計上，均操有致命的威力，茲分而言之。</p>
<p>（一）光度之對比：以黑與白相並，則白愈見其白，黑亦愈增其黑。以灰色比白，則見其更暗，比黑，則見其更淡，若以色彩與黑白等對比，其光度亦立見變化。如黑底之上，飽和黃色最篇顯著。以次則橙綠赤，至於靑紫則黯然失色矣。此卽依各色飽和時光度之高下爲次第也。白底之上，適與此相反，靑紫最顯，而黃最淡。灰底則視其濃淡之度近於白或黑而定其上各色對比之現象。</p>
<p>（二）飽和之對比：飽和度本不能離乎光度與色相。如靛靑顏料塗於紙上，固有其飽和度；以與黃色相比，則見其飽和程度甚高。若與造靑相比，則彼飽和遞减似乎黑色矣。又如羣綠之與草綠，朱之與鮮紅，亦莫不然。兩說相比，固如上述，同色飽和與加粉水冲淡者相比，亦如是感。故從知人目覺色彩之飽和，亦因殘感而變標準。</p>
<p>（三）色相之對比：如前例之赤紫相並，赤微現橙，紫微顯靑。由此證明不同之兩色並置，不但色相互變，其飽和度亦隨之變。但兩色　補色，則更增其飽和而無變化。如圖案家之善用綫條，即基此理。</p>
<p>（四）對比色所引起之顯陷感覺：此爲人面化裝與繪景之必知常識。</p>
<p>顯著——深陷</p>
<p>白——一切色</p>
<p>一切色——黑</p>
<p>黃——一切色除白</p>
<p>赤——一切色除黃白</p>
<p>一切色塗黑——棕·紫</p>
<p>靑灰——藍·綠</p>

<h3>保守與前進</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>一般衛道的老夫子近來時常嘆喟的說：「人心不古，世風日下。」他們覺得這個世界是退化的，黃金時代是在三代以上，至少周公文武孔子還能得到一點正統，後來簡直是道德淪亡，人心險詐了。但是我們和這般衛道之士的「高見」正相反。我們以為社會是不斷前進的。現在的人無論在適應環境的方法上，或工作的效率上，或道德的認識上，都要比古人强。孔子雖能輔定公會齊侯於夾谷，但是假使專憑他當時那點能力來出席現在的四强外長會議，我想老夫子將難以應付了。再就道德方面的來講，我們承認女子和男子一樣都是人，我們沒有許多浮華虛億的禮節，我們在講求自由平等，這許多地方我們比古人進步。「人心不古」，這是實事，但我們郤說是「世風而上！」社會的演變一定是向前進的！</p>
<p>社會的演進是由甚麼力量推動呢？我們可以說這是由於動和靜兩種相反而相成的力量所產生的。動是一種推動力，人類有永遠不能滿足的需要，他們不能不向前探索。動是一種破壞舊的而創造新的過程。靜是一種保持力，不類由於新的需要而求索到一種新的技術去滿足這種需要，於是他們就珍貴的保持着這種技述。靜是一種保守的狀態。以社會活動的過程而論，靜是指既存的社會制度，動是指社會的心造和革命。周濂溪說：「無極而太極。太極動而生陽。動極而靜，靜而生陰。靜極復動。一動一靜，互為其根。……萬物生生，而變化無窮焉。」這個原則仍然可以用於社會的發展。這兩種相反的力量應該是相輔而行的。假使祗有動而沒有動，那末一切都是凝固不化，毫無進步。新的創造不繼續前進，舊的經騐使無法應付環境，不能維繫生存。因此，我們一方面要把新的創造加以保留，另一方面當所保留的新的創造不足以適應更新的需要時我們不能不打破舊的障礙，另闢的途徑。</p>
<p>根據上面的原則，我們可以進一步把社會演進的過程分析成功五個階段。（一）舊的社會制度不足以維繫人心，不足以滿足羣衆的需要，這時候大家都感受到旣存社會的秩序所給予他們生活上的痛苦。（二）少數的先知先覺開始想要推翻舊的秩序而憧憬着一種新的理想。這個時候祗有思想是前進的，而行為仍然留在舊的社會裏面。（三）先知先覺感覺到時機的成熟，便領導着大衆，採取行動，為達到新的理想而鬥爭。這種轉變第一步是在政治上的，第二步是經濟上，第三步是社會風俗習慣方面的。換句話說，先是政治上的革命或改革，繼以產業上的革命，然後再是社會風氣習俗的改革。（四）新的理想實現，新的社會制度建立了起來。這個新的秩序比較的能够滿足大衆的需要，於是使人心穩定下來。人們的行為便開始受着這個新制度的規範。（五）人類的慾望永遠不會滿足的。　需要的滿足更產生了新的需要。這個新的需要又不是旣成社會制度所能滿足，再加上原有社會制度的僵化和腐化，結果又產生了種種新的不滿意。社會的演變就是這樣一層層的向上爬。</p>
<p>舉兩個例子來說明上面的　個社會演進的過程。歐洲神權政治到了十五世紀中業發生了動搖，　權統治使人們感覺到痛苦，黑死病和敎會的腐敗，逐漸的使羣衆非另外找一條生路不可。文藝復興就是要使人回復到人的生活。但是這種理想祗成功了狹意的人文主義的形式敎育，在生活上並沒有發生本質上的變化。後來經過了法國革命和產業現代文化的西方社會秩序。這個新秩序經過了兩次的世界大戰之後又在使生活在它下面的人們恐懼徬徨。歐洲的社會現在便是處於這個階段上。</p>
<p>維繫中國社會兩千多年的專制宗法的社會到了淸末已不能再使人民滿意了，他們中有的人想「變法」，「維新」，有的人憧憬着一個新的理想社會。進一步便是中山先生所領導的政治革命。政體的形式雖然已經改變了。政治思想系統雖然已經成立了，但是一般人的生活習慣以至於政治活動仍然是停留在舊的封建社會的制度中。現在的中國社會就在這個階段中。所以中山先生所說的「革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力，」這句話仍然是有現實性的。中國社會以後的轉變要等待政治革命完成，使中國在政體的實騐上達到了現代的統一境界，再繼以經濟上的改革和建設，社會文化纔合轉移，新的社會制度纔會完成。</p>
<p>社會是演進的，但是它演進的方向是向那一方面走呢？我以為社會的演進就是逐漸更能增進公共的福利。舊的社會制度當初之所以能够成立，乃是因為就當時人們的智力經騐以及旣以及旣存情勢而言，這制度已是最能滿足共同需要的一個制度。但是當時的情勢和經騐限制了人們的眼光，等到後來有人認識這個制度的缺點，再加上新需要的產生，於是人們便起來求索一個更新的制度。為甚麼呢？因為想更能增進大家的福利。這一點成功的時候也就是表示社會更進一步。所以在社會的演進過程中祗有更能滿足大衆需要增進公共福的社會秩序纔有較大的成功的可能性。假使有一股力量想保持一種不合理的秩序而妨礙公共的福利，那便是一支逆流，一時雖能支持得住，但終必失敗。因為社會總是前進的。</p>
<p>在中國社會的現狀中，我們可以看得有兩種相反的力。一種是要保持原有的壯態；一種是要加以澈底的改變。這兩種力量現在雖已經發生了相反的作用，但可惜還不可彼此相成。在動的一方面盡量在致力於破壞靜的方面的工作，而靜的一方面又死命的抓住旣有的靜的狀態而不讓加以破壞。旣存的現狀並沒有在適應羣衆的需要，大家都在叫苦，這是事實。因此，有人在做打破旣存狀態的工作的時候便會受人歡迎。可是因此而使人產生了一種錯覺，以為祗要現狀給打破，就算是成功了。深不知大家贊成改變現狀，其目的交不在破壞，而是在建設。大家希望有一個更合理的秩序出現。因此，祗是破壞不行，同時保持原狀也不行。社會總是要前進的，假使你不使社會改進，自有人會想法子使社會改進。所以我們希望在動的方面要認淸社會演進的建設性和安定性。在靜的方面也要下決心改革旣存的狀態，配合大家的需要。我們希望這兩種力量相反而相成，以促進社會發展，增加共同福　。</p>
<h3>轉變　（小說）</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>陸士平近來新添了兩種習慣：第一是喜歡把右手放到鼻樑邊推那副眼鏡；第二，他愛說「不行」。這兩個字從他嘴裏掉出來，旣淸脆又響亮，簡直還挾着一點威風。同事們不免對他側目而視了——陸士平幹嗎拉上這一副派頭呢？他素來在同時們中間是最寒酸最小氣的，從來不肯在朋友們身上化過一個錢；可是瞧他近來的模樣委實有點不同了：態度，言論，都改了一個樣兒，衣服鞋襪雖然不見得比先前講究，彷彿也比較整潔些。</p>
<p>「老陸是什麼玩意兒啊？」同事們在背後竊竊私議。</p>
<p>有人認為他是窮極無聊，故意裝模作樣聊以解嘲的。這種年頭，公敎人員待遇這樣菲薄，遠不及工人夥計，無論你怎麼節省都不能過日子，他那聊以解嘲的態度也不是沒有理由的，否則，飾餓死果然可能，悶死也是有份的。</p>
<p>可是細細的加以注意，就看出陸士平的新態度決不是在聊以解嘲。他不論跟人談什麼，結論總得感慨地說幾聲「不行」，他提醒人家看看現實：個個人自私，不肯做事，有時候他還舉一兩個例子。說話時候，伸出右手兩個指頭放到鼻樑上，把眼鏡管自往上推。</p>
<p>對於學生，他的姿態更顯得威風了，常常要昂然地把眼鏡一推，高聲吼呌「不行」的。</p>
<p>今天不知那裏來的火氣，心裏本來不痛快；等到退課鐘響過以後，有幾個學生站起來向他請求：</p>
<p>「陸先生，我們來不及寫了，作文卷子課外繳吧！」</p>
<p>他十分嚴厲地說「不行」。推推眼鏡又說：</p>
<p>「怎麼可以不一律呢，我不是說過要作廢的嗎？」</p>
<p>「這個題目不容易做，意思多得很。」</p>
<p>「好，那麼就通融一次。」</p>
<p>可是許多聲音便衝過來：「你自己說的，陸先生，過了時間　卷要作廢的。」</p>
<p>這可有點為難了，他推推眼鏡。然而密層層的坐位上還有聲音衝過來：「到底怎樣可以通融，怎樣就不准通融呢？」</p>
<p>他生氣了，眼珠子挺了出來，彷彿要咬人似的。平常時候，他卽使生氣，也不過皺皺眉頭，向學生瞪上一眼。現在心理上有了個後盾，說話也響亮得多，大聲說道：</p>
<p>「誰鬧？這種樣子不行！」</p>
<p>他隨手把眼鏡推高了，挺起身子在鬧聲中走出敎室，心裏憤憤地說：「做個窮敎員眞沒有意思，不說別的，受這些小子們的氣才麻煩。中國前途有什麼希望呢——像這些頑皮的學生子！」</p>
<p>他傷感起來。回到休息室，同事們看見他一副動怒的臉，有人故意撩着他說：</p>
<p>「士平，幹嗎要生氣啊？」</p>
<p>他先是支吾着不承認自己生氣，然後搖搖頭說學生眞「不行」，他為中國敎育前途悲觀。</p>
<p>「你眞是深謀遠慮，想得這麼周到！」那位同事笑吟吟的說。「像我祇覺得生活艱難，光得把生活解決了，才有餘裕想到個人前途，敎育前途，國家前途！有了吃的沒有穿的，叫人怎麼有辦法想到這些！」</p>
<p>在旁邊聽着的幾位，大家交換了眼色發笑，希望就在道塲合把陸士平的新態度得到一個解答。當然了，大家知道陸士平突然變得趾高氣揚，一定有什麼新的發展。可是他為什麼諱莫如深，不向別人透露一點消息呢？當敎員，跟靑年學子們相處，自有一種融融然的快樂意味，而且同事之間的來往，也比較其他職業單純，碰到幾個談得上的，彼此還可以樹立純潔的友誼。可是這個年頭，竟那麼的動盪不定，敎員公務員待遇這樣不合理，生活逼得大家沉下臉，早已沒有怡然的心情了。能够別謀出路的，也就陸續轉向了別的職業，所以陸士平如果要另找事業，丟棄這敎書的工作，大家不會覺得奇怪，現在叫他們感到興趣的陸士平為什麼要諱莫如深？</p>
<p>陸士平把學生的課卷沒好氣地推在辦公桌角落裏，搖搖頭從鼻孔裏一連哼出了幾個「不行」！</p>
<p>旁邊是化學敎員徐維新的辦公桌，他看見陸士平這種態度很想打趣說幾句，也叫大家沉悶的心趁勢兒鬆上一鬆，門口却走進了程君毅，一脚踏進來就說：</p>
<p>「諸位可知道士平有了什麼新的發展？」</p>
<p>大家不約而同地集中注意，正要知道陸士平打的什麼啞謎，所以對程君前的話格外感到了興趣。大家問他到底是怎麼一回事情。</p>
<p>程君毅是一副愛笑不笑的嘴臉，表示他博聞廣見，大家逼他說，他偏偏先要向陸士平抱歉，問陸士平能不能宣佈出來。</p>
<p>正在生氣的陸士平立刻轉變得和顏悅色了，他叫程君毅別胡扯。</p>
<p>「胡扯什麼呀？」君毅說。「大家聽着，士平寫了一個劇本，正送在莫利先生那邊，祇要莫利先生那邊，祗要莫利先生一介紹，就可以挑選有名的劇團排戲上演了。如果賣座好，上演稅穩拿一兩百萬！」</p>
<p>大家哄然地祝賀陸士平成功。誰都知道他跟戲劇界頗有辦法的莫利先生有點交情，而且陸士平一向對戲劇十分愛好的。</p>
<p>「到底是士平史——我預祝你的成功！如果能够乾脆丟下這口窮敎員的飯，那我更替你高興。」徐維新說。</p>
<p>「別聽他的，這是君毅兄捕風捉影之談。」陸士平聲辯。「我那裏有能力寫劇本，而且又那裏會第一個劇本就賣座，抽一兩百萬的上定說？」</p>
<p>「這麼說起來，一定是君毅故意造謠了！」</p>
<p>「我生平不造謠言！」程君毅說得斬釘截鐵。</p>
<p>性情急躁的幾個受不住這種拐彎抹角的勁兒，就乾脆問陸士平有什麼新機會，大家全是給生活壓得喘不過氣的，也願意看見有個同事會脫離這種艱苦的生活。</p>
<p>可是坐在窗口敎歷史的那位老先生心裏不以為然，他看不慣陸士平的傲然神色——換個職業祗多掙幾個錢罷了，有什麼裝腔作勢，神氣活現的！</p>
<p>徐維新他們却還在跟陸士平說笑，陸士平祗承認他和一個戲劇界頗有名望的人合作改編一個劇本。</p>
<p>「我自己別算在裏面，單單因為原作有名，合編那一位也相當有名，他總可以借點光。祗要能够上演，賣座大槪不會錯」</p>
<p>聽的人很有幾個對陸士平艷羨不置。業餘有這樣一個玩意兒攪攪，豈不對於生活方面一個不小的補助？而且玩的是戲劇，確也很有趣味。</p>
<p>就在這個耐人尋味的時候，大家該去上課了，各人挾着講義或者書本，怨恨自己無法找尋副業。陸士平剛才對學生們的那團火氣，也早已平息了，他本來預備不讓大家知道，等到了上演的時候請全體同事看戲，來一個意外，使同事們知道他陸士平還有這一手！可是現在給程君毅先揭穿了，那也好。他傲然地去上了一堂課，常常伸手去推眼鏡，但並不沉下臉說「不行」了；雖然仍舊說，臉色可是和緩了許多。</p>
<p>陸士平沉醉在幻想裏，他夢想着觀衆在這個戲劇前面怎樣的傾倒。他傲然地看着同事們，厭惡地看着學生們，有時候甚至橫着眼看他們出出進進。</p>
<p>這種態度前後維持了兩個多星期，陸士平的態度又突然轉變了，他變得沉默，也常常推眼鏡，却好像對它生了氣，那麼冷冷的，很有七成不甘心的意思。</p>
<p>於是同事們在竊竊私議了：陸士平是怎麼一回事？人家得意的事情還可以故意去打趣揭穿，如今那種不得意的神色使同事們不便去向他追問，免得引他傷心。可是大家一有機會就說：「士平攪的什麼玩意兒，怎麼一下子又變了樣呢？」</p>
<p>這麼沉悶地過了幾天，好事的程君毅又悄悄的向大家報告了，這一回是沒有當着陸士平面前說的。</p>
<p>「士平那個劇本吹了—最近沒有辦法上演。」他說。</p>
<p>彷彿是證實了一件逗人興趣的新聞一樣，大家為陸士平失望，也為陸士平鬆了一口氣，原來他沉默寡歡，就為了不能上演。那位敎授歷史的先生簡直有點兒幸災樂禍—他認為還是沒辦法上演的好，否則陸士平的傲慢神色不知該高漲到什麼程度！</p>
<p>「那是為了什麼呢？」</p>
<p>君毅搖搖頭，讓眼睛　上三五秒鐘，表示這事情難說得很。</p>
<p>「我上次攪錯了，士平並沒有請莫利先生去批評介紹，他跟合編的那一位另外央人介紹的，於是莫利先生有點不高興，這計劃就難以成功了。」君毅說完了又表示替士平很惋惜，這樣一擱下來，就說不定要什麼時候才有機會。</p>
<p>「那麼為什麼不請莫利先生介紹呢？」</p>
<p>「那大槪是合編那一位的意思了。」君毅說。「原來天下無論什麼事都有門戶之見，我最討厭這一套，沒有意思！」</p>
<p>正說到這裏陸士平進來了，大家裝做沒有談過這回事似的。</p>
<p>陸士平向他們招呼過後又暗暗打量幾眼，有點兒懷疑他們正談論自己，但看不出什麼，也就默默地坐到自己辦公桌邊，不向別人說笑一句。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（六二）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>廖棟應着去了。這時他心裏很茫然！</p>
<p>剛才所目睹的一幕，他也覺得非常慘，但他更覺得恐怖！今天，他第一次看淸楚了小紅，這第一次的印象，偏就是這麼個血淚狼藉，支離破碎的印象！他簡直有些怕再看她了！假如不把他們的關係聯在一起，也許他比現在的感想要好得多，至少他會像寳鈴一樣地同情她，帮助她。而只要把他們的關係聯在一起，她是他的未來的老婆；他將要和她永久地共同生活；這便使憂懼！他已經萌起了一個將來離開這個家的念頭，但想到會為了這個未來的老婆所牽制，他不僅是憂懼，簡直是怨恨了！為着這些複雜的心情，他煩惱！他沒法讓自己很快樂意地去親近小紅，因此，他到了舖子裏秤了二兩米參，又拿了「雲南白藥」，叫李師父去送給廖老闆。</p>
<p>老闆娘看見廖老闆如此關切小紅，心裏不服，蔽着眼睛也不好說什麼，敷衍着和寳鈴把小紅抬到屋裏床上。借岔兒沒好氣地向寳鈴發洩地說：</p>
<p>「好啦，你可以到舖子裏去了，都是你在廚房裏帮她的忙，才帮出這檔子禍來！」</p>
<p>寳鈴碍着瘳老闆在跟前，沒有言語。默默擊案地駡了一句：</p>
<p>「沒有人心的潑婦！劊了手！」</p>
<p>廖老闆先替小紅把兩隻血肉糢塗的脚敷上「雲南白藥」又替她用布包了。然後叫老闆娘熬了參湯喂她喝了一碗，看着小紅稍稍平和些了，這才放下心來。</p>
<p>過了幾天，小紅的傷依舊嚴重，腐爛不堪，人也一直昏迷不醒。倒虧了廖老闆一而去請了大夫來替她診治，一而不斷讓她喝些參湯之害的提神補血藥。據大夫說。小紅的脚絕非短時期能好，而且好了以後還要成為殘廢。</p>
<p>老闆娘可算是懊喪透了！她想：還不過才娶進門一兩個月工夫，便出了這麼大的漏子。醫藥費就要賠上許多，眞是得不償失。將來再殘廢了，不但帮不了自己，反倒要養活她一輩子，豈不白費自己一番心機？這些又不敢向廖老闆抱怨，因為是自己招來的。老闆還在抱怨着自己。而且這塲不幸也是自己造成的。（這自然更不敢向廖老闆說了。）</p>

<p>好像也是這樣一個美麗的月夜，那位朋友，曾用一雙冷靜的眼睛凝視着我，告訴我說：</p>
<p>「你是在月宮裏建築瓊樓，你是在雲霧中打撈珍珠。」</p>
<p>聽不懂她的意思，我呆望着她，她笑了，伸出一隻纖纖白手，指着天邊的明月白雲，輕輕問我：</p>
<p>「你愛這些？」</p>
<p>「是的！」我幽幽地答。</p>
<p>「但你可知道，這是風，這是影，這是幻夢，這是空靈，這不是人生！」</p>

<h3>失樂園</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>——偶然，夜晚街頭的躑躅，在人行道帝的角落裏，發現了一個泥濘塗滿的西式小信封。也許是人們皮鞋的踐踏吧！但是，依稀能辯認信封上沒有一些字跡。抽開來，是二張寫滿了零亂筆劃的信紙，左下角還有鮮紅的機關的名字。這封信的主人，從字跡推鑒起來，像是女的，又像是男的，年紀似乎很輕，信裏也盡是些年輕人的感慨。沒有署名，也沒有收信人，自頭至尾的看了，更使我增了心頭的重負。我想，還是把它公開，還給了寫信者，收信者吧。裏面也有些地方糢糊，只能憑臆測替它補正了。</p>
<p>為什麼又好幾天沒有寫信來？我希望多看些信息，正像沙漠的曠野中尋找着泉源。但，也怕看信，因為不知道你有意還是無意，老愛刺痛我的魂靈，是的，我的魂靈。我還有着它，我自己認為，這不太高興吧。</p>
<p>生活的情形老糟，這幾天腦中的思想更紛歧得厲害。</p>
<p>上寫字間，眞討厭。簽到，坐，談笑，豫算，簽呈……攪來攪去，簡直在和生命開玩笑。無聊的一天一天的溜過，我自己也想不出一個所以然來。晚上寫日記，老對着簿子呆怔着大半天，結果還是到外面馬路上人堆中去擠上一個大圈子。</p>
<p>我那主任可眞不行，就是那年紀輕輕的穿西裝的，牌頭可不小，聽說是×長的外甥，說話老瞇着眼，笑嘻嘻的，跟他講些好辦法，不是推，老是宕，活惹氣。也好，沒有事，辦公室中就老看報，一份報現在能够看上四五個鐘頭，你看可好本領。</p>
<p>讀書一點沒有心緒，舊書都給我送光了。這些撈什子，讀來就是浪費，伏在寫字檯上看辦公室，可就是不用這些東西，我家裏也沒有像强盜一般的搶着些國難財勝利財，可以到外洋去鍍金。早知道這樣，我也不會白吃許多苦頭了。</p>
<p>天下烏鴉眞是一般的黑麼？K.S.P.來信，也老都告訴我這些接收，報銷，假賬。……唉一團糟，一團糟，這些事情，究竟可為呢？不可為呢？在現在這種雜亂無章的環境裏，簡直令人充滿了疑懼和躊躇。威逼，利誘，沒有一點人類的同情心，沒有絲毫生活的興趣，外來的攻擊加上內在的虛弱，我自己也懷疑自己能够尊重自己到什麼時候，污穢的環境當然是醜陋的模型，難道我也逃不出這型式的規範麼？悲從心來，但自己也無法騙慰自己。</p>
<p>告訴我，你也會獃望着那皎潔的明月？告訴我，你也會　淋在狂風暴雨的怒吼中？</p>
<p>回憶不能撩心頭的飢渴，前途更是一片黑暗。有的只是一點微弱的螢光，儘是努力，也照耀不出一點路的軌跡。——你也這樣嗎，為什麼我們的生活不能掙脫這窠臼？</p>
<p>快些回信給我，周圍寂寞得可怕。失去快樂的人，他將對遙遠的友誼是多麼的珍愛？</p>

<h3>Marshal Ma Visited the Chairman Yesterday for a Long Talk; The Three-Person Conference Officially Begins; Agreement Likely on Restoring Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at nine o'clock this morning and returned to his residence after an hour and a half of discussion. He then attended the Military Three-Person Group Meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Military Three-Person Group Meeting, which will determine the final fate of the goddess of peace and the fierce god of war in the next eight days, was solemnly held at Marshall's residence, No. 5 Ninghai Road, at eleven o'clock this morning. The government representatives were Xu Yongchang, Yu Dawei, and Guo Rugui. The CCP representatives were Zhou Enlai, Teng Daiyuan, Huang Yifeng, and Tong Nusheng. The U.S. representatives were General Marshall, Colonel Koyi, and others. Marshall chaired the meeting, which lasted for two hours and adjourned at one o'clock. The content of the meeting was agreed upon not to be disclosed to the public. However, according to relevant sources, the government and the CCP have reached an agreement on the issues of ceasefire and restoration of transportation due to repeated concessions by the government. However, no agreement has been reached on the troop reduction ratio in the troop reorganization plan and the issue of the Communist army's stationed areas. Therefore, the signing is still pending.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] It is reported that in today's Military Three-Person Group Meeting, both sides have agreed on the restoration of transportation, the priority repair of the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways, and the partial demolition of blockhouses along the railway lines. According to sources here, this is a good demonstration of mutual concession and a prelude to the Military Three-Person Group Meeting achieving good results.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the final decision-making power, the CCP insists on giving the U.S. representative greater mediation and execution power, that is, disagreeing with the government's proposed majority decision-making power.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] From 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM this afternoon, Zhou Enlai met with Marshall and extensively exchanged views on general issues beyond the scheduled discussion topics. At 6:00 PM, Zhou returned to Meiyuan New Village. At 6:30 PM, Shao Lizi drove over and talked with Zhou Enlai for half an hour, leaving at 7:00 PM. According to Shao, he represented the government in making an oral reply to a letter from the CCP representatives to the government representatives yesterday. Shao and others initially believed that this letter from the CCP was decided before the Chairman issued the decree extending the ceasefire. Now, the CCP side claims that it was indeed decided in advance. According to Shao, the first three of the four items mentioned in the letter are expected to be resolved within these eight days, and the fourth point need not be discussed further, as the Political Consultative Conference has already made a decision, and only implementation is pending.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours this afternoon, and the issues discussed were not on the agenda of the Military Three-Person Committee. Marshall visited Chairman Chiang several hours after today's Three-Person Group Meeting. Observers here believe that Marshall's repeated meetings with the Chairman without going through government representatives may lead to a quicker solution. The Three-Person Group will hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the CCP office said that the CCP agrees with the Democratic League's proposal that soldiers should not participate in politics.</p>
<h3>CCP's Topics Are Increasingly Out of Touch and Empty; Obviously Employing Delaying Tactics Again; Minister Peng Discusses the CCP's Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, when meeting with reporters at 6:00 PM this afternoon, criticized the four points in the letter from the CCP delegation to the Chairman yesterday, especially the fourth point, which was too vague, regarding "reorganizing the government, protecting human rights, relieving people's livelihoods, and completing unification." Minister Peng said: If the CCP brings out Marx's Das Kapital to discuss the relief of people's livelihoods, it may take ten years and still not produce results. The CCP's topics are increasingly out of touch and empty, and they are obviously employing delaying tactics again. The most important thing at present is the troop reorganization issue. Once a troop reorganization agreement is reached, other issues will be easily resolved. Otherwise, any agreement that has been signed will be difficult to implement. For example, regarding the restoration of transportation, based on past experience, even if the railways are repaired, they will still be damaged by the Communist army occupying the railway lines. If the troop reorganization issue is resolved and the Communist army's stationed areas are determined, conflicts can naturally be avoided. Now, the CCP is demanding a long-term ceasefire first and then further negotiations, which would lead to indefinite negotiations. Therefore, the government cannot agree. If the CCP is sincere in negotiations, then eight days is not a short time and is sufficient for negotiations. Looking back at the negotiations in the past five months, the Communist army has taken advantage of the ceasefire to continuously attack Chahar, seize Changchun, and seize Harbin. The previous example is a chilling reminder. To avoid the CCP's delaying tactics, the government must set a deadline to quickly obtain concrete measures for permanent peace.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Third Force Negotiated with the CCP Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Representatives of the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and prominent figures from various circles, including Fu Sinian, Mo Dehui, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Shen Junru, and Zhang Shenfu, invited CCP representatives to discuss at the Academia Sinica at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan attended to report on the progress of the recent negotiations and explain the CCP's position. The representatives of the three parties did not express their specific opinions, but all hoped that the future of the negotiations would be fruitful and decided to invite government representatives again at 4:00 PM on the 24th at the National Assembly Hall to report on the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Dong Yanping Returns to Shanghai; Will Report to Nanjing Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Dong Yanping, head of our military delegation stationed in the Soviet Union, along with delegation members Qiu Nan and Zhu Xinmin, returned to Shanghai from Vladivostok yesterday (the 22nd). They plan to report everything to Nanjing soon.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming Visits the Mausoleum Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, went to visit the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 10:00 AM this morning. Ma Xiang, Director of the Security Department of the Mausoleum Management Committee, personally received him at the auditorium. After the ceremony, he visited the Linggu Temple and returned to the city at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Cooke to Fly to Pearl Harbor Today</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 21st] Admiral Cooke will fly to Pearl Harbor today to confer with Admiral Duweisi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Capital Outlying Reporters Association, regarding the Hong Kong government's unreasonable suspension of the National Daily News, telegraphed to colleagues across the country today for unanimous support.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Journalists' Delegation Passes Through Xuzhou and Goes to Nanjing Before Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Shanghai Journalists' Delegation arrived in Xuzhou at 7:50 PM on the 21st by taking the Longhai Railway express train from Zhengzhou. They changed to the Jinpu Railway express train that night to go to Nanjing and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 24th.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Extension Order Issued; People in Peiping and Tianjin Feel Relieved</h3>
<p>Newspaper editorials all hope for mutual concession.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] In the afternoon of the 22nd, Peiping had abundant rainfall. In the evening, after the rain, the sky cleared, making the ancient capital different from the usual summer heat. Along with the issuance of the ceasefire extension order, the anxious mood of the people over the past half month was greatly relieved and refreshed. Two days ago, Peiping held an important military meeting, and Zhou Zhirou, Sun Yingzhong, Liu Duoquan, and Zhao Jiaxiang all seemed to have participated, but their heavy feeling was diluted by the ceasefire extension order. The price of gold, which had been stimulated by the current situation, had risen to 209,000 yuan on the evening of the 20th. After the news of the ceasefire extension order came out last night, it plummeted to 203,000 yuan. Today, the lowest price of gold has reached 202,000 yuan, while the depressed stock market has been striving to move upward. Generally, people hope that the peace talks can achieve results within two days. Today, the North China Daily published an editorial entitled "Another Eight Days After Fifteen Days," agreeing to continue peace negotiations, but not to postpone them indefinitely. It also pointed out that negotiations should not be empty talk and must solve problems. The World Daily published an editorial entitled "Let's See These Eight Days Again," calling on people not to let these eight days pass lightly like the past and believing that even if there is still a considerable distance between the two sides on various issues, if there is sincerity and the ability to concede, the dispute can be resolved with a single change of thought. The Yishi Daily published an editorial entitled "Happy to Hear That the Ceasefire Order Has Been Extended by Eight Days," also believing that the basis of negotiations lies in sincerity. Whether the judgment is fair or not is irrelevant. With sincerity, there is no need for Marshall's judgment. Without sincerity or with insufficient sincerity, Marshall's judgment may also be in a difficult situation. Finally, it called on "Do not close the door to peace, even if the negotiations do not go well within eight days." The Xinmin Daily published an editorial entitled "Extend Negotiations First to Improve Psychology," mainly saying: (1) It is hoped that the Communist army will end its offensive in Shandong and Shanxi; (2) It is hoped that if the central government believes that the Communist Party can be resolved by force, then it should simply let go and do it. If the government does not have the possibility of eliminating the Communist army, it is better not to fight. Another newspaper wrote a short commentary entitled "The Final Moment," calling on all parties to prioritize the country and the nation and not to let the hard-won victory be wasted, so that future generations will be eternally grateful for the kindness of the public. The Tianjin Republic Daily published an editorial entitled "Do Not Miss the Opportunity," hoping to quickly break the deadlock with the assistance of international friends. There have long been precedents in international law for the authority of third parties, which is only to solve problems and does not harm the independence of independent countries. The Tianjin Yishi Daily published an editorial entitled "A View on the Overall Situation," pointing out that the international environment, economic bankruptcy, political relaxation, and public opinion are no longer suitable for civil war, and finally proposed that war is useless and peace is precious.</p>
<h3>Liaocheng Under Intense Communist Army Attack; The Situation Around Jinan Eases; Communist Army in Changqing Withdraws North Across the Yellow River; Fleet Patrols the Bohai Sea and Returns to Its Original Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 21st] The situation outside Jinan has eased. The Communist army in Shilipu, Longshan, withdrew to the area between Puji and Mingshui on June 1. However, there was fierce fighting near Yaojiazhuang, northwest of Yancheng. Liancheng is still under intense Communist army attack. Furthermore, the Communist army in Guidetown, Changqing, crossed the Yellow River westward on the morning of the 20th and retreated to the northeast. Their intentions are unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 22nd] Our naval fleet patrolled the Changshan Islands and the Bohai Sea for four days. Now, the fleet has gradually returned to its original defense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Central Propaganda Department today denied reports that naval warships had bombarded Yantai and Weihaiwei, which are now in the hands of the CCP.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 22nd] According to sources from the Central Propaganda Department, an official who recently defected from the Communist army to the National Army stated that 20,000 Communist troops have approached Hanzhuang in southern Shandong and are preparing to cross the Grand Canal to attack Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>National Army Surrounded in Yongnian</h3>
<p>Both sides agree to withdraw to Anyang</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] Both sides have agreed that the besieged Yongnian garrison will withdraw to Anyang.</p>
<h3>Peiping-Shijiazhuang Telephone Lines Not Open; Transportation on the Datong-Puzhou Railway Improves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 22nd] Transportation circles report that the telephone lines between Peiping and Shijiazhuang have not been open as of 4:00 PM this afternoon. It is rumored that Communist troops between Zhengding and Saixidian have repeatedly cut the wires in the past three or four days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Transportation on the Datong-Puzhou Railway has improved. There has been no damage from Linfen to Pingyao. The damaged areas in the northern section and between Pingyao and Zhanglan in the southern section were repaired on the 21st. The southbound train from Taiyuan has directly reached Linfen, and the northbound train has directly reached Yuanping. However, the situation north of Daniudian is still unclear.</p>
<h3>Mediation Work in Xiaozui, Northeast China; Validity Period Also Extended; Rumor Has It That Zhao Jiaxiang Will Serve as Chairman of Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] Officials of the Military Mediation Department stated that the effective period of the mediation work of the executive groups during the ceasefire in Northeast China, as decided in Nanjing, has been extended along with the extension of the ceasefire period.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] The situation in Northeast China has not yet stabilized. It is rumored that many military generals will follow Liang Huasheng and serve as administrative heads in various regions. High-ranking officials from Northeast China in Peiping are rumored that Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, will serve as Chairman of Liaoning Province, and Zhao Gongwu, Commander of the 52nd Army, will serve as Chairman of Liaobei Province.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] Today is the first day of the eight-day extension of the ceasefire in Northeast China. Ye Jianying told reporters today in a rather serious manner that no matter what, the overall situation should be reversed during these eight days. The people can no longer bear the war and must not fight again. The Military Mediation Department is making its best efforts to reduce obstacles to peace talks. Ye said that he has absolute confidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 21st] The Unified Takeover Committee has been formally established here, and all takeover plans are expected to be implemented step by step.</p>
<h3>Steagall Returns to Changchun</h3>
<p>Held Talks with Lin Biao in Harbin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Colonel Steagall, Chief of Staff of Barr, flew to Harbin at 11:45 AM on the 21st and left Harbin at 10:15 AM on the 22nd to return to Changchun. When Steagall and his party flew to Harbin Airport, those who welcomed them at the scene included Lü Zhengcao, Rao Shushi, and TASS reporter Petrov. After Steagall and others got off the plane, they took a car to the city and drove directly to the former residence of the President of the South Manchuria Railway on Nangang Hospital Street, which is now the "Liaison Office of the Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army" to rest. A colored archway with the words "Welcome General Barr" was erected in front of the door. In the afternoon, Steagall had a long meeting with Lin Biao. This morning, when reporters asked Steagall at the airport about the details of yesterday's meeting, he refused to disclose the content, but judging from his expression, it seemed that he had gained something. This morning, those who saw him off at Harbin Airport included Lin Biao, Lü Zhengcao, Peng Zhen, and TASS reporter Petrov. Those who came to Changchun on the same plane included all the personnel who went to Harbin, as well as Rao Shushi and Zhou Erfu, a reporter from Xinhua Daily.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Personnel of the four groups of the Military Mediation Department have not yet arrived, and the location of work has not been finalized. Of the four observation groups previously dispatched by the United States, only the Rafa group has arrived, while the other three groups in Haicheng, Hailong, and Zhangjiawan are still on the way.

<h3>"No More Than Three" This Extension of the Ceasefire Order Should Be the Last Time</h3>
<p>By Fang Canglang</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Stationed in Nanjing by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon on June 21, 1946, when the sun was shining brightly and the heat was dizzying, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department announced the good news that the ceasefire period would be extended to 12:00 noon on June 30. At the same time, he also read out the order from the Chairman of the National Government to the front-line troops to continue to cease advancing and pursuit. After this news was announced, dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters at the scene could not help but feel mixed emotions and breathe a sigh of relief. The good thing is that the ceasefire period has been extended, and there is still a glimmer of hope for peace. We do not have to immediately report the heartbreaking news again; the sad thing is that experience has told us that the style of fighting while negotiating will not produce any good news if it is not changed. The facts have also told us that the poor people can no longer bear it, and the Chinese idiom "no more than three" is also worth being more cautious and more fearful. Because in the past, ceasefire orders have been issued twice on January 10 and June 6. This time is the third time, and it should be the last time. Everyone must remember that this time the expiration is at the end of June, which is the day when banks close accounts and businesses settle accounts. Please calculate how much money, energy, and the blood and sweat of the people have been wasted in the past six months due to unsuccessful negotiations? The people have paid a huge price for peace and cannot waste any more.</p>
<p>Troop Reorganization Comes First, The Nation Comes First, The Suspension of Hostilities is Extended by Only Eight Days. At present, the Three Major Problems that Urgently Need to be Resolved in the Peace Talks Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are: The Suspension of Hostilities in the Northeast, the Restoration of Transportation, and the Reorganization and Unification of the Army. Unless these problems are resolved reasonably and legally, The measures that have already been negotiated, such as the establishment of the Forward Division in Changchun, the strengthening of the authority of the Executive Group, the demolition of blockhouses, and the unification of road administration, road camps, and management rights, etc., will be obstructed and damaged at any time by the military forces entrenched and lurking in various strategic areas and on the land and sea transportation lines. This is not the concern and obstacle that should exist under a democratic government, nor is it something that the people who hope for lasting peace are willing to agree to. Therefore, the government advocates giving priority to troop reorganization in the military three-person conference, which is warmly supported by the people. At present, the CCP representatives are unwilling to withdraw from Harbin and Andong in the Northeast, and they are unwilling to withdraw from the provinces of Jehol and Chahar, as well as Yantai and Weihaiwei, and the places occupied after June 7, on the grounds that they are deeply afraid that the government will drive the Communist army to remote areas and eliminate them. After the CCP representatives publicly released this news yesterday, people felt very strange, because when the troop reorganization is implemented, the CCP will join the government's command of the national defense army, so why should they make such a dangerous plan, why do they still have such an outdated view! What the Chinese people are now asking of all parties is that the nation comes first, not military affairs. The CCP should reflect, and people outside the CCP should also work hard to find better ways and statements to help the CCP eliminate this kind of unfounded fear that does not meet democratic requirements in order to complete the work of troop reorganization.</p>
<p>If China cannot quickly reorganize and disarm its troops, every day it drags on, according to unofficial statistics, every citizen will have to bear at least 500 yuan of military expenses and other losses every day. This is an unparalleled loss, a shocking loss on the verge of destruction. The entire Subei has a population of only a few million, but more than three million have fled one after another because they could not bear the chaos and education of the CCP. Recently, even self-cultivating farmers, tenants, and small shop assistants have fled. Sadly, most of those who fled are honest, poor, and have low abilities, so they fled hell and became hungry ghosts. Not long ago, several foreign reporters who did not believe in it personally ran to Zhenjiang to conduct on-site investigations. As a result, not only did they do good deeds by opening their wallets, but they also conducted a real democratic test, because they understood that there is absolutely no opposition in the "democratic areas" occupied by the CCP. Is this democracy? Amen! (Sent from Nanjing on June 22)</p>

<h3>Powell Proposes Restoring Coal Mine Production in Northeast China to MacArthur; Diverting Part of Japan's Power Generation Equipment</h3>
<p>[Gazebo Tokyo, 22nd] Special U.S. Compensation Envoy Powell told reporters yesterday: I have left half of the survey committee in the Northeast to survey the factories in the areas occupied by the Chinese National Army and the Communist Army. They are led by Mr. Handler and are expected to enter the above two areas soon. Handler also reported that he had agreed to meet with CCP representatives in Changchun. I met with MacArthur's staff on the 22nd and had lunch with MacArthur. I suggested that some power generation equipment be transferred to the Northeast as soon as possible. Dong and I believe that this move is necessary to prevent important coal mines such as Fushun and Xinqiu from falling into an unmanageable state. In the current situation of the world coal shortage affecting the United States and the Far East, if we do not find a way to replenish the power equipment removed from the above important coal mine areas, the restoration of war damage will inevitably be delayed for many years. Even if it is possible to immediately transfer the various equipment from Japan to the Northeast, it may not be enough to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and the development of economic collapse. We are scheduled to leave Tokyo on the 22nd for Taiwan, then from Taiwan to the Philippines, and then to Paris and Berlin. In Paris, I will give a preliminary report to Secretary of State Burns, at which time I will consider my observations and "contribute my opinions to the overall compensation plan for the Far East and Europe."</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Central Auxiliary Organs: The Authorities Instruct the Executive Yuan to Expedite Measures; Ministries and Commissions Rush to Compile and Submit Rosters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Since returning to the capital after victory, the Supreme National Defense Council, in order to enhance administrative efficiency and save national treasury expenditures, previously resolved to reorganize and merge various central organs, reduce personnel, and decided that the Executive Yuan should handle the overall planning.

<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 21st] A telegram from Cirebon indicates that the general situation there has deteriorated further. The Indonesian authorities have notified the local overseas Chinese that if the situation becomes urgent, they should evacuate to the northern villages.

During the Japanese occupation and after "surrender", Indonesians continued their anti-Chinese activities in Java due to being heavily influenced by Japanese propaganda and intimidation tactics. Xin Bao wrote an editorial on this open letter, stating: The Chinese government should no longer adopt a covert policy. The Indonesian government should also prove to the world that it not only desires but is also able to exercise its power in any region within Indonesia.

<h3>Local Correspondences</h3>
<p>Chuansha: Puppet Secret Agents Have All Surrendered Their Weapons</p>
<p>Recently, a unit claiming to be the Chuansha Station of the Southeast Region Special Commissioner's Office of the National Government Military Commission, led by Wang Baoming, the station chief and deputy station chief from Zhoupu Town, and Zhang Jinkang, who served as the president of the puppet Chamber of Commerce of Zhoupu Town and the puppet town mayor, brought more than a hundred staff members to reside in the county and established groups in various townships. They carried weapons in plain clothes, arbitrarily arrested people, used torture, extorted money, and did everything possible. In the past week, those illegally arrested include Ding Huishan, Wu Shumei, Zhu Zhang, etc., all of whom were extorted large sums of money. According to reports, the people's self-defense teams in various townships of the county, at the request of the people and out of righteous indignation, joined forces with the county security brigade a few days ago to disarm all members of the secret agent team, send them to the county government, and request that they be brought to justice.</p>

After the work was completed, at about 1:00 PM, the civilian laborers returned to Xiaduanshi Street and crossed the river by ferry. Due to the rapid tide and waves, the ferry, carrying about ten or more people, suddenly capsized. After all efforts were made to rescue them, five or six people were rescued. By evening, seven male and female corpses had been recovered. The families of the deceased carried the corpses to the district office for placement, which was a terrible sight.

<p>Hangzhou: Flood Affects Transportation on All Routes</p>
<p>Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Hangzhou-Zhuji section, due to recent mountain floods, the roadbeds and tracks from Zhuji to Zhibu were flooded, and transportation was blocked. Now that the weather has cleared and the water level has gradually receded, the early express train arriving at 11:00 AM on the 20th can arrive at Zhuji as usual, and transportation has resumed. As for highway transportation, due to bridges being washed away, the connecting direct buses from Zhuji to Jiangshan are still suspended.</p>
<p>Zhuji: Torrential Floods, Joint Efforts to Rescue</p>
<p>This county has recently experienced torrential rains, resulting in mountain floods in the upper reaches of the Puyang River, creating a vast expanse of water. There are many breaches in the embankments along the river, and the low-lying areas have become a country of marshes, with crops submerged and the autumn harvest hopeless. Moreover, the urban area is over a foot deep in water, and the flood is still rushing in through the three city gates along the river. Small boats have entered the city to replace rickshaws as a means of transportation. Many bridges have been washed away, and the Dian埂 outside the South Gate is in imminent danger. County Chief Zhu is personally supervising the police, civilian laborers, and some officers and soldiers of the 187th Division stationed there to jointly rescue. It is also reported that in the area east of Nansha in Xiaoshan, tens of thousands of acres have been washed away by the river water since last year. The Sancha and Xiaosibu areas have all been successively submerged. Recently, due to the rising water in the upper reaches of the river, the riverbank collapse has become even more intense, with an average of over a hundred steps collapsing daily. Most of the houses of local farmers have been washed away because they could not be relocated in time, and the scene is extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Peace Should Begin with Eliminating Suspicion!</h3>
<p>Peace! Peace! All mankind is yearning for peace, but the whole world is worried that peace cannot be guaranteed. This is not only true for China, but the Chinese people hope for peace most earnestly and seek peace most forcefully. If the Chinese people did not sincerely and genuinely pray for peace, why would they, at the moment of victory, accept the advice of the United States and conclude the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship with the Soviet Union? On this basis alone, it can be judged that the Chinese government and people, from top to bottom, are willing to make any sacrifice to strive for Sino-Soviet friendship and eliminate the potential sources of suspicion between China and the Soviet Union, or even between the United States and the Soviet Union, in the Far East, simply to lay a good foundation for peace in the Far East and even world peace. The National Government of China is willing to use this spirit of self-sacrifice to lay the foundation for peace in the Far East. Is there any reason why it would not be willing to seek domestic peace through extreme tolerance? Therefore, in today's China, calling for peace does not need to be addressed to the National Government. The authorities' hope for peace is more urgent than ours. Pushing representatives and boycotting classes are unnecessary and superfluous actions. If we truly want peace to be realized and even ensured, we must first earnestly implore the Chinese Communist Party to eliminate their preconceived suspicions!</p>
<p>The Communist Party is a revolutionary party, not a democratic party. Therefore, it was trained from suspicion during its growth period. It guards against people dealing with it everywhere and constantly guards against people plotting against it. Therefore, its members often refuse to trust people easily. Because of this, they can often be untrustworthy. In the minds of Communist Party members, it seems that they have never believed that there can be mutual trust between people. As for trust between countries, they believe that "trust" is even less certain. "Speaking of trust and cultivating harmony" are originally related; because they are not accustomed to "speaking of trust," it is also very difficult to "cultivate harmony." This is not only true for the Chinese Communist Party, but all Communist parties in the world inevitably have some habits of suspicion. Today, if we want world peace and Chinese peace, the most fundamental way to start is probably to find a way to restore the faith of Communist Party "comrades" in humanity and eliminate their ingrained habits of suspicion. On this point, all parties or countries that stand in a position relative to the Communist Party should make an effort. Mencius said: "If loving people does not bring them close, reflect on your sincerity." We still need to find out why we cannot eliminate the suspicions of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>For example, in terms of international issues, the "atomic bomb" is one of the reasons that has caused the Soviet Union to be particularly suspicious. The U.S. authorities are well aware of this. Therefore, after the opening of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, its representative, Baruch, proposed a very important suggestion, advocating that atomic energy be handed over to international institutions for control and declaring that if an international atomic energy agency can be established, it is willing to hand over all atomic bombs for destruction and cease production. At the same time, the United States has successively suggested that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France conclude a 25-year defense alliance against Germany, and that the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain conclude a 25-year defense alliance against Japan. In the United States, this can be considered to have exhausted its intelligence to provide the Soviet Union with collective security guarantees and eliminate the Soviet Union's suspicion of other powerful countries in the world. The international gloom should be expected to dissipate. But Soviet representative Gromyko has other suggestions, advocating the use of international agreements to prohibit the manufacture and use of atomic weapons and demanding that the United States destroy all existing stockpiles of atomic weapons within three months after the establishment of the international atomic energy control agency. It can be seen that the Soviet authorities' suspicion has not been eliminated. This is really a pity! U.S. representative Baruch once said a moving and shocking sentence: "World peace or world destruction will depend on the outcome of this meeting." The issue of atomic energy, which is related to world security, still remains a core issue of Soviet suspicion.</p>
<p>In fact, in today's world situation, the reason why the Soviet Union is uneasy and insists on expanding its "security zone" is that it cannot be said that it is psychologically threatened by atomic energy. Conversely, the reason why Britain and the United States are firmly opposed to the Soviet Union retaining veto power over international management of atomic energy and are unwilling to suddenly disclose atomic energy secrets is that the Soviet Union has repeatedly adopted uncompromising attitudes in diplomacy, which has led to this. The Soviet Union is uncompromising everywhere at the London United Nations General Assembly, the New York Security Council, and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. In the Soviet Union, it may think that it is not convenient to easily trust Britain and the United States; but in the eyes of Britain and the United States, this is just enough to show that the Soviet Union is difficult to trust. With such mutual suspicion, cooperation is naturally full of thorns. Therefore, how to eliminate the suspicions between powerful countries is a prerequisite for world peace. Because if there is mutual trust between powerful countries and there is no war, there is no reason why small and weak countries would want to provoke war.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation in China, we also require both parties in the negotiations to dispel suspicion, and especially hope that the government will do its best to eliminate the Communist Party's suspicious psychology. We believe that the government is moving in that direction, but we hope that the Communist Party will also move in that direction.</p>
<p>In order to negotiate with the Communist Party, the National Government, because it is not easy to believe, invited other parties and non-partisan "third parties" to negotiate together. Should the Communist Party be able to trust it? However, no! Then the government has no choice but to disregard the dignity of the country and has to ask American friends to mediate and has the Communist Party's agreement. The arrival of Special Envoy Marshall in China and President Truman's statement should convince the CCP that its American allies can speak a fair word, right? However, today it seems that another "no" has been answered! The purpose of the United States is only to hope that China can succeed in becoming a democratic, unified, and strong China. It does not favor any party in China. Special Envoy Marshall's plan is just to ensure that the Communist army is also incorporated into the national army and that Communist Party members and members of other parties can sincerely participate in the government and jointly govern. These are the wishes that the Communist Party should have. Even if the Kuomintang may want to deceive the Communist Party, and the National Government may want to suppress the Communist army, now that the government is emphasizing that it is willing to respect Special Envoy Marshall's fair judgment and is willing to obey "majority rule" during negotiations, then as long as Marshall agrees with the Communist Party's proposal, the government will not avoid any sacrifice. The government is seeking peace in this way, which should be considered sincere, but why can't it get the Communist Party's understanding and accept Marshall and its American allies' fair judgment? If the "comrades" of the CCP, even today, cannot eliminate suspicion and are unwilling to exchange ideas with each other and negotiate openly, then even if we shout for peace, "peace" will be very vague in China. For the country, for the people, for our ancestors, and for our descendants, we earnestly implore the CCP not to be suspicious anymore, so that the flower of "peace" can blossom brilliantly in China.</p>
<h3>Four-Nation Co-Management of Japan Proposal: China and Britain Accept, Soviet Union Has Not Replied. Thorough Supervision of Japanese Demilitarization, Mutual Assistance Treaty for a Term of 25 Years</h3>
<p>[United States News Service, Washington, 21st] The U.S. State Department has recently released a proposed treaty between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union for the demilitarization of Japan for 25 years, similar in nature to the treaty for the demilitarization of Germany announced by Secretary of State Byrnes at the first foreign ministers' conference on April 29th. The draft has been sent to the governments of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. According to a State Department spokesperson, China and Britain have responded with satisfaction, but the Soviet Union has not yet replied.</p>
<p>The draft states that if the world needs peace and security, it must completely demilitarize Japan. This has not yet been guaranteed, but only with such guarantees can the nations of Asia and the world be assured of returning to peaceful habits. The draft stipulates the complete elimination of Japanese military organizations, military equipment, and tools for manufacturing armaments, and proposes the establishment of a four-nation management committee to conduct inspections throughout Japan to ensure the strict implementation of the treaty. Each of the enemy nations must formulate detailed measures regarding this mutual assistance within six months of signing the treaty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The United States has proposed to China and the Soviet Union the establishment of a four-nation commission to oversee Japan, taking over the supervision of Japanese affairs. Secretary of State Byrnes previously suggested to the Soviet Union, Britain, and France that they conclude a 25-year mutual assistance treaty to jointly monitor Germany's disarmament. This measure concerning Japan is a related part of that. In practice, this measure will only be implemented after the current military occupation ends. However, if a co-management treaty can be signed and established early, the large-scale military occupation can also end earlier. Currently, the handling of Japanese affairs is almost entirely managed by the United States. Once the treaty takes effect, this monopolistic situation will cease. According to the State Department, General MacArthur is fully aware of the content of this treaty, but whether he approves of it is still unknown.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] A Foreign Office spokesperson said that Britain welcomes in principle the American proposal to conclude a four-nation treaty to monitor Japan for 25 years. Britain received the draft treaty at the same time as it received the draft treaty on the four-nation control of Germany. British officials, from Foreign Secretary Bevin down, have expressed their support. Britain has some opinions on the details of the treaty, which have reportedly been telegraphed to Washington. Negotiations on this matter have made little progress, so Washington's announcement yesterday caused surprise in Britain.</p>
<h3>Our Military Police Team to Japan Next Month: Provisional Garrison Area is Nagoya. Withdrawal Plan for Japanese Troops and Civilians Within Our Borders to be Completed Next Month.</h3>
<p>[This City News] Our government, in order to participate in the Allied co-management of Japan, has had Generals Zhu Shimin and Dai Jian negotiate with General MacArthur's headquarters to handle the procedures for our troops to be stationed in Japan. The first group of officers and soldiers to go to Japan is the Chinese Military Police Team stationed in Japan, totaling 200 people, led by Chen Yuliang as the team leader. The officers and soldiers of this team went to the U.S. military headquarters yesterday for vaccinations and are expected to leave the country next month. This military police team will be the vanguard of the 67th Division, led by General Dai Jian, to be stationed in Japan, arriving in Japan to do preliminary work, with the provisional garrison area being Nagoya. At the same time as this military police team, the Rear Echelon Command, the 1st Branch, the 11th Motor Vehicle Battalion, and the Tank Company will also go to Japan, totaling four units. The second group to go to Japan is the 67th Division under the command of General Dai Jian. Previously, our side had decided to send the 3rd Independent Military Police Battalion to Japan to take on military police work, but now this military police team is being sent instead, because of its larger scale. The officers and soldiers of this military police team are selected from the Youth Army and the India-Burma Expeditionary Force, and most have a high school education. Many are also able to speak English and Japanese. Most of the team members are from Sichuan and Anhui provinces. According to team leader Chen Yuliang, the military police have received special training, and the equipment is relatively complete. They are currently undergoing centralized training and will undergo a major inspection before leaving the country. The supplies for this team after going to Japan will be transported from China, because the cost of living in Japan is currently too high, and the American troops in Japan are also self-sufficient. Therefore, the Chinese troops stationed in Japan will also transport their own supplies from China.</p>
<p>[Another News] As our country's military police team stationed in Japan is about to leave the country, the Military Friends Society of this city held a farewell party at the society at 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] General MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the large-scale withdrawal plan for 1,452,741 Japanese troops and civilians within China will be completed on July 4th of this year. The biggest task will be repatriating 116,743 Japanese residents still remaining in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tanggu. If cholera had not occurred, hindering transportation, the scheduled plan could have been completed on July 4th of this year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] A spokesperson for the 11th War Zone Commander's Headquarters stated that Chinese military governments, commercial organizations, and private families are still privately hiding Japanese women to prevent them from being repatriated. He did not specify in what capacity these Japanese women are unwilling to be repatriated and remain here. According to speculation, they are willing to stay here as concubines or servants. The spokesperson said that Japan had employed women to engage in espionage work, and the remaining Japanese women will pose a potential threat to security. Therefore, the Chinese authorities have ordered public security bureaus and military organizations to start investigating.</p>

<h3>Walt Disney New Cartoon Production, Difficult to Distinguish Between Real and Animated Actors</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hollywood, 21st] Walt Disney is now employing real actors in his cartoons. Perhaps one day, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and other characters will all be played by real people. Previously, Walt Disney's cartoons also featured real and animated characters appearing together on the screen, but now he is using real actors entirely or mostly to make cartoons. Ye Shi's first new work after the war is called "Song of the South," which, in addition to animated characters, also features three living characters, one named Tescal, with a slightly crooked face, a seven-year-old girl named Luna Barton, and another named Jack Chance Basket, a black man. Seventy percent of this film will be performed by real actors. According to people in the studio, they guarantee that you will not be able to distinguish between real and animated characters when you watch the movie.</p>
<p>Walt's other film, called "Heartstrings," will also feature Bila Ying Futi and Bell Ayers to assist in the performance, in addition to the two children mentioned above. Eighty percent of the scenes in this film are done by real actors. However, 100% animated films are unlikely to become a reality at present.</p>

<h3>Calling for Peaceful Completion of Unification: Shanghai's 800,000 Workers' Organizations Form "Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance"</h3>
<p>Launching Citywide Expanded Propaganda Starting This Morning; Industrial and Educational Circles Deny Sending Lin Handa and Others to Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, at 3:00 PM yesterday, convened a meeting of directors and supervisors of various industry trade unions at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, and immediately resolved to organize the "Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance," calling for an end to civil war, demanding peace, and completing unification. It also passed telegrams to Chairman Chiang, letters to fellow workers, and several temporary motions.</p>
<p>More than 300 people from 180 units, including the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Postal and Telephone, Water Supply, Water and Electricity, Cotton Spinning, Sanitation, Shipbuilding, and Machinery, attended the meeting yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, member of the Central Standing Committee, Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs were present to provide guidance. Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiangkui, Fan CaiKui, Shui Xiangyun, and Fang Rusheng served as the presidium. Chairman Zhou Xuexiang first reported that the Federation of Trade Unions had convened the fifth symposium of fellow trade union members to discuss the central issue, which was due to the seriousness of recent national affairs. Yesterday, students throughout the city held demonstrations against the civil war. To live and work in peace and to achieve unity and peace, we must take consistent steps. The 800,000 workers throughout the city must be organized and on the right track, striving for the anti-civil war effort that is the unanimous desire of the 400 million compatriots throughout the country. As for the occurrence of this civil war, many fellow workers in the industrial sector do not understand the process, so we have asked Director Wu, Director Lu, and others to provide us with guidance.</p>
<p>Preventing All Illegal Activities</p>
<p>Director Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs stated: Recently, everyone has felt uneasy, and this unease is caused by political factors. The eight-year War of Resistance has exhausted the people and drained the country's wealth, and the subsequent Communist Party's separatist rule has plunged the people into misery. Chairman Chiang has given the Communist Party a final opportunity, extending the ceasefire order to the end of the month, hoping that the Communist Party will take the overall situation into account and achieve a peaceful resolution before the deadline, accepting the agreement. I recently returned to Shanghai from Zhenjiang and witnessed and heard the suffering of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu, described the deception of the Communist Party's slogans. Trade union leaders should be vigilant and not be deceived. We must stabilize social order and calmly prevent all illegal activities.</p>
<p>Studying the Factors of Non-Peace</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan said: Everyone wants to strive for peace. All mankind in the country and the world hope for peace. Peace is the normal state, and civil war is a pathological state. When there is a disease, it must be cured. The method of medicine, how to heal, depends on the doctor and the prescription. The Chinese government authorities sincerely want peace. After the victory last year, in order to seek friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and at the same time make the United States friendly to the Soviet Union, it signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, recognizing the independent vote in Inner Mongolia, and jointly managing the China Changchun Railway, painstakingly seeking world peace. The National Government must be responsible for the country, the nation, and all mankind, so is it not sincere in seeking peace internally? We must have confidence in the government and give it full authority to handle this matter. We must study where the factors of non-peace lie, and it is clearly in the Communist Party, so we must call for peace, demanding peace, and demand it from the Communist Party. Furthermore, the Communist Party is an international party, and the decision-making power of the CCP is not in the hands of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and it is not in the hands of the Chinese people at all. Whether we are the party in power or the party out of power, we must be a truly Chinese party. We must express the people's desire for peace and shout out to the non-peaceful side. Looking at Jiangsu Province across the Yangtze River, it has become two worlds, and the people of northern Jiangsu are fleeing to southern Jiangsu day by day. Is northern Jiangsu democratic? The eight-year War of Resistance relied on Chairman Chiang's leadership and did not go the wrong way, and with national unity, we were able to win the battle. At this once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national revival, some people have forgotten the Chinese people, are not led, and are dividing the land, destroying this once-in-a-millennium good opportunity, "Opposing the civil war is the key to curing this disease. We must believe in the doctor, and the Sino-Japanese War that could have led China to its death was brought back to life because the prescription of the Chairman was correct; the purpose of peace is permanent peace, the disease must be cured, and after taking medicine and injections, it can reduce fever and relieve inflammation, which is the blessing of Heaven. If the fever does not subside and the inflammation does not go away, surgery must be performed. In short, opposing the civil war is everyone's common demand, how to stop it, we cannot make a decision, but we cannot delay it, otherwise everyone will be dragged to their deaths.</p>
<p>Don't Be Fooled By Them</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian said: The Communist Party wants to lead our workers to the wrong path. What people in the industrial sector hope for is to have a job and be able to live. Our responsibility is also to enable every worker to have a life, but the Communist Party is the opposite. Please tell every worker not to be fooled by them and let themselves be used by them.</p>
<p>Unanimously Organize a Grand Alliance</p>
<p>Following Zhao, a postal worker who fled to Shanghai from Qidong, northern Jiangsu, reporting on the Communist Party's deceptive behavior towards fellow workers in northern Jiangsu, the following was unanimously resolved: to organize the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance, to pass the constitution of the Grand Alliance Council, and to elect Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Yuan Zhaozhang, Fan CaiKui, Lu Keming, Fang Rusheng, Song Peiyao, Yao Zhizheng, Chen Shunxing, Tang Zhenbao, Hu Menglin, Zhang Zhusan, Qiu Changjiang, Zhou Fujiang, Shao Ziying, Liang Yongzhang, Zhou Yunjiang, Zhang Ziheng and other forty-five people as directors, seventeen people as alternate directors, and immediately pass a letter to fellow workers, a telegram to Chairman Chiang to stop the source of the chaos, and twenty-one slogans of the Grand Alliance. Starting this morning, workers throughout the city will be mobilized to post slogans and expand propaganda to stop the civil war. It was also decided to convene the first council meeting of the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance at the Federation of Trade Unions at 3:00 PM today. Finally, a temporary motion was passed (1) The representatives of the Valley Trade Union do not recognize the dispatch of Lin Handa, Ma Xulun, Kui Yanfang, and Bao Dasan as representatives to Beijing to petition, and send a telegram to the chairman to clarify. (2) Deny the reactionary slogans posted in the name of various trade unions.</p>
<p>Passed Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>(3) Send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the original text of the telegram passed by the conference yesterday is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, After the victory of the War of Resistance, the people of the country hoped that they could work together to build the country, but the Communist Party, on the pretext of democracy, actually implemented separatist rule, attacked cities and seized land, massacred compatriots, destroyed transportation, and disrupted production, causing the people of the country to suffer the pain of displacement after suffering from war. The government, taking the overall situation into account, has repeatedly compromised and made concessions, negotiating with each other in order to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible. However, the Communist Party has always been obsessed and inconsistent in words and deeds, and has no credibility. Now that the ceasefire deadline has arrived, its military disturbances are still pressing ahead, and its conspiracies and tricks are endless, and it actually wants to put the country and the nation in a state of eternal doom. The fellow workers are heartbroken to see this and cannot remain silent. I hope that the Chairman will uphold the established policy, make a decisive decision, and take severe measures to stop the source of the chaos. All the fellow workers in Shanghai pledge to be the rearguard. This is a telegram to Chairman Chiang. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance.</p>
<p>Solemnly Deny "Representatives"</p>
<p>[Another News] The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance of Workers in this city and various colleges and universities above specialized schools, because someone has borrowed the name of Ma Xulun, Lin Handa, Bao Dasan, Huang Yanfang, etc., who claim to be representatives to petition in Beijing, unanimously solemnly denied it, and separately telegraphed the Chairman and Dean Zhu to clarify. At the same time, the Student Federation of this city also telegraphed the National Government yesterday, and separately telegraphed the student community and the press in Nanjing, denying that Ma Xulun, Lin Handa, Huang Yanfang, etc. were ever elected as representatives for peaceful petition, urging them to pay attention.</p>

When her husband, Li Shiqun, served as the director of the Political Security Bureau of the Pseudo-Agent Headquarters, he was a henchman of the tiger and participated in his affairs. In September of the 28th year, he took the position of accountant of the department, managing food, wages, and miscellaneous expenses, as if he were the hostess of "No. 76." In March of the 32nd year, he was again introduced by rebel Zhou Fohai to serve as a member of the Pseudo-Economic Committee, and did not leave office until September of the following year. During the interrogation, Ye was calm, answering questions while trying to avoid being photographed by photographers. When answering questions about property, she said that there were four houses, plus gold and silver jewelry, all of which had been seized by the Military Intelligence Bureau. Asked why she wanted to enter No. 76, she replied that because she and Li Shiqun were married, and the department stipulated that non-employees were not allowed to stay, she had to hang the name of "accountant," as for participating in political affairs, she said that women could not engage in secret political work. When talking about killing people, not only did she completely deny it, but she also asked the judge if he could cite the year and month of her killing people. As for the membership of the Pseudo-Economic Committee, she did not deny it, only saying that the purpose was to facilitate car travel, so as not to have her cheeks be pulled by Japanese soldiers like Chen Qun's wife. After the adjournment, she met with her children and discussed marriage issues with her second daughter. She still constantly thinks about family matters, but after saying a few words, she was escorted back by the bailiffs.</p>

<h3>She Aizhen</h3>
<p>Continues to Support Wu Shibao to Save Face</p>
<p>Another [person] — Wang Zhi's [insect] She Aizhen, through the investigation by Prosecutor Yang Ding and Secretary Li Zhang, was interrogated in court in the afternoon. She was also barefoot, wearing leather shoes, and a light purple fine checkered cheongsam, with a large hair bun on the back of her head. When the photographer aimed the camera at her to take a picture, she reversed her previous shy appearance and faced it calmly. First, Prosecutor Yang asked her when she entered No. 76. She cleverly raised her hand, covered her mouth with a handkerchief, thought for a moment, and then replied: "It was in August of the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939]." [Prosecutor] asked: "When did you come out?" She replied: "In the 29th year [of the Republic: 1940], I contracted typhoid fever, so I moved out in September." [Prosecutor] asked: "Until what year did you work as an accountant for the pseudo-police guard team?" She replied: "I stopped working after leaving No. 76 in the 29th year [of the Republic: 1940]." [Prosecutor] asked: "Why did you stop working?" She then deliberately raised her voice and replied: "I was only nominally in the position." When asked about the internal situation of the Special Service Headquarters, she hesitated and did not give a detailed answer. Therefore, she was ordered to temporarily withdraw.</p>
<p>Witness Testimony Incomprehensible</p>
<p>Another witness, Xia Zhongming, was summoned. Xia was a translator at No. 76 and also served as the director of the pseudo-Investigation and Statistics Department. According to his testimony: He joined the pseudo-government in July of the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939] and knew that Wu Shibao died in Suzhou in the 31st year [of the Republic: 1942]. The actual person in charge of No. 76 was Li Shiqun. He did not understand the internal affairs of the guard team, and he did not know about She Aizhen's evil deeds. Subsequently, Li Zulai, the deputy manager of the pseudo-Bank of China, was interrogated. When asked about his relationship with Yu Aizhen, he replied that he had only met her a few times and was not familiar with her. All the rumors circulating outside were false. As for She Aizhen's crimes, he had no evidence and could not make blind statements, so he did not know what her behavior was like. However, what he had previously provided regarding She's property was true. Shen Fenggang also testified: He originally worked for the central government. After being arrested twice in the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939], he joined the guard team of the Special Service Headquarters at No. 76. Wu Shibao was the captain of the team at that time, and She Aizhen did not hold any position. He also did not know about the arrest of Fang Yexian.</p>
<p>Still Trying to Cover Up Her Husband's Crimes</p>
<p>At this point, Prosecutor Yang summoned She Aizhen to the court again. She admitted that she had served as an accountant for the pseudo-police guard team, but she still tried to cover up her husband's crimes in every way. She even tried to save face for her deceased husband, saying: "Gambling tables in western Shanghai existed before the war and did not become prosperous due to Wu Shibao's influence. There was no opium smoking. As for the so-called table money, it was not that Shibao wanted it, but those old gamblers themselves offered it to him as a sign of respect." After Secretary Li recorded everything in the file, he announced the adjournment of the court and rescheduled the interrogation.</p>
<h3>City Shelters Ordered to be Demolished — The Public Works Bureau Decides to Implement Next Week</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the trend of building shelters has been very rampant. Some citizens are unwilling to respect the property rights of owners, regardless of the area, and arbitrarily choose other people's land to build houses on a large scale. Although the Public Works Bureau has issued a notice to demolish them, many still ignore it. Even the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau sent personnel to a certain place the other day to intervene and were beaten. The Public Works Bureau had previously announced that all shelters within the city were not allowed to be built, and building houses in the suburbs was only allowed more than 15 feet away from the highway. Now that the deadline for demolishing houses has arrived, the Public Works Bureau has decided to cooperate with the Police Bureau starting next week to forcibly order the demolition. In addition, for those who forcibly occupy other people's land, the owners can also appeal to the Public Works Bureau to request demolition. At the same time, the bureau will soon announce regulations to resolve the current illegal construction of houses.</p>

<h3>Chen Yuansheng Defeated by a Young Girl — The Main Culprit in the Gold Bar Case Captured in Shangyu and Escorted to Shanghai — Sick and Weary in the Depths of a Secluded Bamboo Grove, Holding a Pot and a Scroll</h3>
<p>Suddenly Raises His Head as if Waking from a Dream — Do You Remember the Time When We Picked Up Gold Together by the Water?</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] These days, every Shanghai resident, when opening the newspaper, cannot help but take a look at that long advertisement: "The Central Bank offers a reward for the arrest of fugitive Chen Yuansheng..." Gradually, everyone seems to become familiar with this young man who is only thirty years old.</p>
<p>Chen Yuansheng stole gold bars and US dollar bills and fled on May 23rd. Yesterday, June 22nd, he was escorted to Shanghai by the police. The value of gold bars, US dollars, and a lifetime of reputation is not small, but what Chen Yuansheng got was only thirty days of joy!</p>
<p>When the theft was discovered at the Central Bank of Shanghai, a young traveler who had just arrived from Shanghai came to the Huaxing Apartment in Hangzhou. He was wearing a beige youth suit, yellow leather shoes, a white straw hat, and black glasses, and opened a room at number 69. On the registration book, he wrote: "Chen Junshi, age 30."</p>
<p>This Chen Junshi was very generous, spending three to four hundred thousand every day, as if it were nothing. He played in Hangzhou for a week, living a life of pleasure every day. On June 1st, he went to Suzhou and Jiaxing to play again, and returned to Hangzhou after another six or seven days.</p>
<p>At that time, Hangzhou had just started banning dancing. Chen Junshi became a generous Meng Changjun in front of those Yingying and Yanyan.</p>
<p>However, when he returned to the apartment, he had already bought all the newspapers and carefully read them with a little panic.</p>
<p>On June 12th, he suddenly asked the tea boy: "How do you get to number 37 Yangfang Bridge, Baochu Pagoda?"</p>
<p>Number 37 Yangfang Bridge is a delicate villa. Chen Junbao found it that day and stayed there until June 17th. He told the old woman at the door that he was going out to a wedding and would probably be back in a day or two.</p>
<p>But he was too flustered and left a note in the room with a simple map and the words "Shangyu, Zhejiang" written on it.</p>
<p>Chen Junshi disappeared on June 18th. But at 1:00 PM that day, the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau received a top-secret phone call. Someone secretly reported that Chen Yuansheng had been discovered in Hangzhou!</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM that day, Zhou Guanghui, the judicial section chief of the Huangpu Branch, patrol officer Yao Hongzhang, and battalion commander Han Zuchen, boarded a special express train to Hangzhou. At 9:00 PM, they arrived in Hangzhou and immediately joined forces with the Provincial Police Bureau to launch a very strict search. A waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe said that he had seen such a person, who was always accompanied by beautiful dancers and singers and often ate at Guanshengyuan... That person lived in the Huaxing Apartment... and went to Baochu Pagoda Yangfang Bridge!</p>
<p>It was already 1:00 AM, and it was pouring rain. Section Chief Zhou and his party rushed to the villa and found the note with the words "Shangyu, Zhejiang"!</p>
<p>The next day, they set off for Shangyu. After crossing the Qiantang River and arriving at Xixing, a ticket seller at the Hangzhou-Cao'e Highway bus station had seen such a person who chartered a car to the Cao'e River. The police officers chased after them, passing through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. At 3:00 PM, they crossed the Cao'e River and chased to Baiguan.</p>
<p>During the inspection in Baiguan, a tea boy at a small inn told them that two days ago, a 30-year-old Ningbo youth named Chen Long had stayed overnight but had already taken a boat to Shangyu.</p>
<p>The detectives walked over a high mountain, reached Lianghu, fifteen miles away, hired a foot-rowed boat, and after a thirty-five-mile water journey, chased to Shangyu at 7:30 PM!</p>
<p>This "Chen Long" had a haircut in Shangyu and asked a sedan chair carrier how to get to Dingjiazhai Taochangwan. The sedan chair carrier asked for 35,000 yuan. He said he didn't have enough money. A charcoal seller volunteered to show him the way, and he left Shangyu.</p>
<p>The police officers found the charcoal seller. There was no boat in the small river, so they waded across. Ahead was a thirty-mile rugged mountain road!</p>
<p>At the end of the road was a cliff. The police officers climbed up through the thorns. This was Taochangwan!</p>
<p>All around were bamboo forests. In the depths of the secluded bamboo grove, in front of a thatched cottage, an old woman was weaving bamboo ware.</p>
<p>Chen Yuansheng was sitting next to the thatched cottage!</p>
<p>He held a wine pot in his right hand and a book in his left hand. When he saw the police officers, he said very politely: "You've worked hard!"</p>
<p>He said: He reads the newspapers every day and doesn't want so many relatives and friends to be involved in lawsuits because of him alone. He hasn't slept well for three nights, and the barking of dogs in the deep night has deepened his unforgettable worries! He has had chills and fever for several days.</p>
<p>He said, "I am very ashamed to have troubled you so much--but if you had come a day later, I'm afraid I wouldn't be here."</p>
<p>Chen Yuansheng was really sick and couldn't walk, so the police officers helped him down the mountain. They rushed back to Baiguan that night. When they arrived in Xixing, the river was closed. The small boat rushed through the wind and waves in the dark night. At 10:30 PM, they arrived in Hangzhou. Chen Yuansheng tasted the taste of iron bars for the first time at the Provincial Police Bureau.</p>
<p>At 6:10 PM yesterday afternoon, the excited police officers excitedly brought Chen Yuansheng to the Huangpu Branch.</p>
<p>In this month, Chen Yuansheng finally lived a few days in "paradise." He went to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and swam in West Lake with beautiful young girls. He visited Lingdui Temple. In front of Lingyin Temple, a gold bar suddenly fell out of his pocket and fell into the gutter. The young girl bent down to pick it up, but Chen Yuansheng said, "Why bother? Life is important!"</p>
<p>It is said that the one who called the Huangpu Branch was this young girl!</p>
<p>When Chen Yuansheng left Shanghai, he took three gold bars and 260,000 yuan in cash. One bar fell in Hangzhou, and one bar had already been exchanged for thirty days of enjoyment. The Central Bank can only get back one gold bar. The 2 million yuan reward to catch Chen Yuansheng is probably about the same.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Time When the Grain Case Occurred — Whether to Convict According to the Interim Regulations on Grain Management — The Garrison Headquarters is Seeking Instructions from the Highest Authorities</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters was still sorting out the results of the interrogation of the defendants in the grain loan case yesterday. The presiding judge's desk was piled high with documents. According to his statement to reporters, this work may take two or three days. The Military Law Department's review of the grain case is divided into three parts: one is the collusion and embezzlement of grain officials and rice merchants who obtained grain loans, one is the suspicion of hoarding rice by Wu Rongsheng of the San Tai Company and Wang Xunzhi of the Yangtze River Company; and the other is the suspicion of Rong Yongming raising prices. Also, because the "Interim Regulations on Grain Management During Extraordinary Times" were initially promulgated in Shanghai in June and listed as a pilot area, and the occurrence of each grain case was before June, it is still under instructions from the highest authorities whether to convict the defendants based on these regulations. According to a reporter's investigation, Rong Yongming will be interrogated again tomorrow, Monday, and several witnesses will be summoned at that time. A verdict can be made after the interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Grain Loan Embezzlement Case — Senators Will Express Their Views</h3>

The documents have been drafted and are being signed, which can be announced today.</p>
<h3>Zhu Shunlin, the Boss of the Gambling Tables During the Enemy and Puppet Period, Puts on a Pitiful Appearance — The High Court Concludes that He is Not a Traitor — Transferred to the District Court, Which Held a Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhu Shunlin, the chief inspector of gambling tables such as "Hollywood," "Hui Le Palace," and "Six Nations Hotel" in the western Shanghai area of ​​criminal soil during the enemy and puppet era, and the owner of the "Dasheng" gambling house in the southern city, was previously prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor. After interrogation, it was determined that he was not a traitor and was transferred to the District Court for handling. The case was tried by Prosecutor Ye Guiling in the Third Criminal Court at 3:30 PM yesterday. Zhu hired Lawyer Ma Zhenzong to defend him. Although Zhu Shunlin had been detained for a long time, he was still full of energy and physically strong. He was still very energetic when answering questions, but when asked about his property, he put on a very pitiful appearance. He claimed: "I initially opened a leather shoe store and later did real estate business. As for the Shun Yuan Tea House, it has been open for more than ten years and only sells tea, not gambling. After the war broke out, I couldn't afford to go inland, and my life in Shanghai was poor. The bosses of 'Hollywood' and 'Six Nations Hotel' pitied my poverty and asked me to watch the door and prevent petty thieves." At this point, Zhu rolled up the sleeves of his gray Paris long gown and wiped his mouth, shamelessly saying: "I have always been afraid of the pseudo-police bureau and No. 76. How could I be qualified to contact them and open a gambling house?" When talking about property, he said that he only had a few pieces of land, which had already been submitted to the authorities, and that his son owned the other properties.</p>
<p>Two Other Gambling Table Owners Summoned</p>
<p>[Additional report] Wang Maoting, the owner of a gambling table, was previously granted bail by the High Court, as reported in previous newspapers.

<h3>The "Daban" System of Dance Hostesses Will Be Strictly Banned</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the director of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, Fang, told reporters that the main motivation for this round of dance hostess registration is to overturn the old dance hostess "daban" system as much as possible. There are already regulations on the set time for dance hostesses to sit at the table and the number of dance tickets, etc., but because the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters has not been clearly defined, strict bans have not been enforced. Now the Police Bureau has asked the City Government to decide that the management of dance hostesses in the future will be solely under the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau, and the item that dance halls are not allowed to employ "daban" to make profits will be strictly enforced in the future.</p>

<h3>Roundtable Discussion on Relieving the Housing Shortage: Emphasis on Taxing Unrented Vacant Properties and Encouraging Landlords to Rent by Appropriately Increasing Rents</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Social Service Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in response to the increasingly severe housing shortage in the city, held a roundtable discussion at its office at 2:00 PM yesterday. It invited representatives from the media and relevant government leaders, including Wang Guanqing, representing Mayor Wu, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, and over thirty reporters from various newspapers. Xiang Xueru, the director of the preparatory office, presided over the meeting, stating that to solve the housing shortage problem in the city, he would like to ask all present to base their concrete suggestions on the principles for relieving the housing shortage laid down by Chairman Chiang, so as to provide a reference for the authorities to resolve the housing crisis. He also stated that if vacant houses are found not to be rented in the future, the authorities should impose heavy taxes on them, and the tax revenue collected could be used as funds for building affordable housing. Wang, representing Mayor Wu, spoke, saying that the housing shortage is not only a social problem but also a political one, and therefore he hoped that citizens would embrace a spirit of service and cooperate fully. According to the principles for relieving the housing shortage stipulated by Chairman Chiang, the area of housing per person should not exceed 100 square feet. If it does, the competent authority may impose a housing excess tax, with a progressive tax rate. That is, for every 100 square feet exceeding the limit, 40,000 yuan will be charged per day, and it is stipulated that the maximum should not exceed three times the original amount; otherwise, the authorities will force the property to be rented out. Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan then provided three concrete measures: (1) To eliminate the bad practice of topping housing prices with gold bars in the city, the advertisements for house rentals in newspapers should be strictly prohibited in the future, or the Housing Management Committee could be responsible for renting out properties at reasonable rents for civilian use. (2) Appropriately increase housing rents in the city to encourage landlords to rent out their properties. Finally, Chairman Xiang made a conclusion, briefly stating that the agencies responsible for housing management are still not unified. The office will suggest that this work be generally under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, and that fairness should be strived for, especially in the allocation of housing. The roundtable discussion ended at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Faculty and Staff of the Temporary Peking University Demand Government Placement</h3>
<p>Stating That They Will Withhold Exam Papers if No Resolution Is Reached</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 21st] (Delayed dispatch) The temporary Peking University remedial class is about to end, and how to place all 1,300 faculty and staff members has become a serious problem that urgently needs to be resolved. The faculty association of the temporary university recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the faculty and staff members of the soon-to-be-closed temporary university be given reasonable placements, hoping that the government would order the authorities of various colleges and universities in Peking to form an appointment committee, with the faculty of the temporary university as a unit, to jointly organize the appointment committee based on each person's academic qualifications, experience, and writings, etc., to seek reasonable and equal employment. Before this problem is resolved, the faculty association has decided to be responsible for keeping the exam papers and grade units for this semester's exams, and will only submit them after there are substantial results.

<p>[United Press, Peiping, 22nd] Zang Qifang, the Ministry of Education's special commissioner for Northeast education, announced in Shenyang today that it is planned to establish one national university each in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, and to establish specialized schools in other major cities. It is planned to establish a commercial specialized school in Dalian, an engineering specialized school in Andong, an agricultural specialized school in Qiqihar, and a normal college in Yongji. The South Manchuria Medical University, established by the Japanese in Shenyang, will be reorganized into an independent medical specialized school. However, Zang did not specify when the above plan could be realized.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Qingdao Promote Electro-Education by Utilizing Enemy and Puppet Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] In order to promote electro-education, the Ministry of Education has formulated and implemented plans in the past two years, and has repeatedly notified all provinces and cities to comply. Among them, the establishment of electro-education centers and educational radio stations is a matter of urgency in the plan. Guangxi took the lead in establishing a provincial educational radio station on May 15th, broadcasting educational news exclusively. Qingdao took the lead in establishing an electro-education center, and the scale is quite grand. Ningxia, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Shanghai, Qingdao, Peiping, and other provinces and cities all have plans and have reported them to the Ministry of Education. It is recently learned that the former Victory, Haiguang, Minyuan, and Three Movie Theaters, which were taken over in Shanghai, are now jointly managed by the Shanghai Municipal Social and Educational Bureaus and have been converted into public theaters. Currently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, considering them enemy properties, intends to auction them. The Ministry of Education believes that the establishment of an electro-education center should be included in the electro-education promotion plan, and that movie theaters can be utilized. If an auction is necessary, the Municipal Education Bureau can acquire them at a relatively low estimated price, which would save public funds and achieve the practical benefits of promoting electro-education. It has been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Education, ordering the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau not to auction them directly, but to transfer them to the Municipal Education Bureau for the purpose of establishing an electro-education center, in order to facilitate the implementation of the plan. In addition, the Qingdao Municipal Government has taken over three movie theaters of Japanese and German origin and has converted one into a well-equipped electro-education center, one for the use of the Qingnian Tuan Municipal Party Headquarters, and one leased to a commercial enterprise. After consultation between the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department, it has been decided that one will be used by the Central Propaganda Department, and two will be used by the Municipal Education Bureau to operate electro-education centers and educational movie theaters. In addition, there are similar situations in Jinan and other places. The Ministry of Education has reported the situation to the relevant departments and ministries, hoping that all provinces and cities will implement the electro-education plan as soon as possible.

<h3>Students of Datong University Organize School Protection Corps</h3>
<p>Deciding to Resume Exams as Scheduled Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Our City News] The unrest at Datong University on Xinzha Road in the city, which was triggered by the demand to protect sovereignty and launch a peace movement, has been deadlocked for many days. At 2:00 PM on the 21st, Mayor Wu Guozhen personally came to give a lecture, advising students to study peacefully. Most of the well-behaved students were moved and were willing to resume the examination immediately. At 7:00 AM yesterday, the 22nd, Wu Guozhen personally came to Datong University again to inspect whether the students were taking the examination peacefully. At that time, students were flocking to the school to take the examination. Unexpectedly, a small number of unruly elements led students from other schools to the school, disrupting order, and convening a meeting in the square, insisting on opposing the examination. At about 9:00 AM, Mayor Wu ascended the square and gave a lecture to all the students, shouting himself hoarse, but the unruly elements remained in a deadlock and unmoved. At that time, the Gordon Road Branch and the Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to the scene to maintain order. At 12:00 PM, Mayor Wu failed to mediate and left the scene to rest in the reception room. Afterwards, many students who demanded the examination, in order to protect the rights of their classmates and avoid wasting their studies, specially organized a school protection corps for students of Datong University. It was decided that from the 24th onwards, in accordance with the school's regulations, the examination would be held as usual, and Mayor Wu agreed to send armed police to the school to maintain order to prevent reactionaries.</p>

<h3>Feature Article: India's Only School of Journalism</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>Punjab University</p>
<p>The newspaper industry in India can be considered quite developed. Every city and town has its own local newspaper, in addition to English, there are also newspapers in local languages. For example, in Calcutta, in addition to English, there are newspapers in Bengali and Urdu; in Lahore, there are newspapers in Punjabi, which is an exception. Although the Indian newspaper industry is developing rapidly, the only educational institution in India that trains newspaper professionals is the Department of Journalism at Punjab University. This spring, at the invitation of Professors Nath and Bandhu of Punjab University, the author took the Indian Northwest Railway train from Hardwar in the Himalayas to Lahore. This is the capital of Punjab Province, called the Five Rivers in Chinese Buddhist scriptures, and is one of India's ancient cities. Before British rule in India, it was the former capital of the Muhammadan and Sikh Empires. The tall, red-turbaned policemen who serve in the Shanghai Police Department today are Sikhs. Today, it is an important center for Northwest India's border defense, education, industry, and commerce. Regarding education, there are thirteen colleges and countless primary and secondary schools in Lahore. In order to thoroughly understand the teaching situation of the Department of Journalism at Punjab University, the author was accompanied by an Indian friend, Professor Nath, to visit the university. According to the records, the Department of Journalism at Punjab University was established on October 1, 1941. Although its history is not long, the department has developed rapidly. All the graduates work in major newspapers across India. The current Deputy Director of the Information Bureau of Punjab Province is a graduate of the department. There are six full-time professors in the department, and the lecturers are all concurrently held by presidents and editors-in-chief of local newspapers, who come to the school to teach classes on time. The chairman of the department is Mr. Singh (Prof. P.P. Singh), who graduated from the Missouri School of Journalism in the United States and the Department of Journalism at the University of London in the United Kingdom, and is a pioneer in the Indian press. The admission level for students is that they must have a bachelor's degree. The study period is set for one year. The class time for the department is set from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, so some graduate students of the school can not only take their regular courses every morning, but also take new courses in the afternoon, which is more convenient for professional youth who are interested in the newspaper industry to have the opportunity to pursue further studies. Often, when graduate students graduate, they receive two diplomas, one for their undergraduate major and one for the certificate from the Department of Journalism. The tuition fee for students is 15 shields per month, and the food cost is 25 shields. Including other certificate fees, registration fees, library borrowing deposits, and membership fees for the Journalism Society, the total cost is only about 50 shields per month. The savings in cost can be imagined. There are three examination papers for student graduation: (1) Theory of Journalism, (2) English News Writing, (3) Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi News Writing. As for the daily courses of the department, they can be roughly divided into five categories: (1) News Interviewing, (2) News Layout, (3) News Writing, (4) Galley Proofreading, (5) Book Discussion. In addition to these, there are auxiliary courses such as business management, advertising, history of journalism, comparative journalism, and journalistic ethics, which are quite complete. At the same time, in addition to textbook teaching, the school authorities arrange for students of the department to practice in various newspaper offices from time to time, so as to verify theory and work with each other, and achieve the effect of knowing and acting as one. There are many newspapers in Lahore, the most famous of which is the Civil &amp; Military Gazette, which has the widest circulation. The issuance of Indian newspapers mostly has its background. Some are British official newspapers, such as the Statesman, and some are propaganda for various parties, such as the Amrita Bazar Patrika (Congress Party), the Morning News (affiliated to the Muslim League), and the Nationalist Newspaper (affiliated to the Hindu Mahasabha). The author has consulted with graduates of the department, and they know little about the Chinese newspaper industry. When I mentioned that there are two newspapers in Calcutta, one is the China Daily (its remarks are closer to democracy) and the other is the Indian Daily (the Kuomintang's official newspaper), they admired them even more. People in our country who are engaged in cultural undertakings, because they are separated by foreign languages, have not been able to spread the culture of their motherland to foreign lands. In the future, the world will realize press freedom, and press freedom will be used as a means to establish lasting international peace. We hope that our colleagues in the newspaper industry should cooperate and connect with foreign newspaper organizations to achieve the effect of mutual understanding. This is the author's hope.

<h3>Hong Kong-Shanghai Football United Team Competes Today, Xingdong vs. Hualian, 4:30 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>Tickets for Maintaining Order are 10,000 Yuan Each</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Xingdong United Football Team will make its sixth appearance in Shanghai at Yiyuan at 4:30 PM this afternoon, against the Hualian Team of Qingbai and Donghua United. The players of the Hualian Team are all famous football stars in Shanghai, and their strength is unparalleled. Since the Hong Kong army was defeated by Qingbai last time, the addition of Donghua's strong players will make the battle even more intense. According to the notice from the Football Committee yesterday, in order to limit the audience in order to maintain order in the stadium, the ticket prices have been readjusted, and all seats are priced at 10,000 yuan. Military police must also enter the venue with tickets. In addition to 30% of the ticket revenue being used as travel expenses and necessary expenses for the Xingdong Team, the rest will be allocated to various charitable organizations in the city for relief and charitable causes. Tickets will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Wu Shouheng and Huang Renyi. The full lineup of 17 players for the Hualian Team will be decided before the game. The Xingdong lineup was decided last night by team leader Hu Hao and captain Xu Jingcheng after careful discussion and is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hualian</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Li Ning, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Zhai Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Xin Fuzhen, Meng Yangliang, Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Han Longhai, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>(Management) Wang Xinheng, E Sen</p>
<p>The Hualian Lineup Will Be Decided Temporarily</p>
<p>The Hualian Team will face Xingdong today. A total of seven generals have been carefully selected and decided by the Football Committee. Looking at the list above, it is known that it will not be difficult to line up a strong lineup at that time. Although the official battle money is yet to be decided on the spot, it is generally speculated that Banglun will be the goalkeeper, the defense will be shared by Yan Shixin and Wu Qixiang, and the center back will belong to Xin Fuzhen. The most ideal forwards are Zhai Yongfu and Gao Baozheng. Cao Qiuting could have played as the five forwards, but in order to retreat and make way for the capable, Li Yao will be sent. Li Yao and A Sun have a tacit understanding. Li Yichen is recommended as the center forward. If A Kui and Chunhua cooperate, they will definitely be able to perform their duties happily. It is not yet known how the authorities will decide.</p>
<p>Xingdong</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng, Huo Yaohua</p>
<p>Luo Quan, Guo Yingqi, Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou, Li Zhaorong, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>(New Recruits) Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng</p>
<p>Xingdong Changes the Center Back Lineup</p>
<p>The Xingdong guest army, in view of the lessons learned from the battle with Qingbai, yesterday decided after careful discussion by team leader Hu Hao and captain Xu Jingcheng. Goalkeeper Zhu Zhaoheng, although slightly flustered in previous battles, has recently made progress. The defense is shared by the left-footed king and Huo Yaohua, with Guo Yingqi as the center back and Luo Weiquan and Liu Songsheng assisting on the left and right. In terms of forwards, Li Shuoyou and Li Zhaorong each take their positions. Zhang Jinhai is in charge of the central army. Feng Jingxiang and Deng Guangsen have also found their places. Such an arrangement can be called quite considerable. Today, there is no problem with Xingdong's forwards and defenders. Whether Jingcheng can hold the middle line after being transferred will be the key to today's victory or defeat.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Holds Tank Field Performance</h3>
<p>A portion of the mechanized troops led by Jiang Guoliang has been temporarily stationed in the kindergarten and middle school dining hall of Shanghai University on Yangshupu for several months.

<h3>Government Bond Black Market Collapses, Unsecured C Bond Drops Another 600 Yuan, Operators Gather to Discuss Cessation of Trading</h3>
<p>The government bond market collapsed yesterday, with the black market in utter disarray. Prices varied wildly, with trading resembling a "bargaining" session. Many parties were preparing to take delivery, while short sellers had no bonds to deliver. Holders were also unwilling to easily sell off their physical bonds, creating a stalemate. Although the low price was reduced by 200 yuan, the value was too small. Apart from direct offsets, the actual volume of physical bonds traded was minimal. Trading in Unsecured C bonds only started sporadically after 9:30 AM, starting with a buy price of 200 yuan. Ultimately, short sellers covered some positions, with buys around 800 yuan, a further drop of 600 yuan compared to the previous close. Operators gathered to discuss suspending trading until after July, and there was also talk of requesting preferential treatment from the authorities. With no official trading, miscellaneous bonds remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Drops, Down 65,000 Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the extension of the ceasefire order to the end of the month had already shifted sentiment. The central government further exerted pressure in the market. Under this double whammy, the gold price fell significantly yesterday. After opening at 1,975,000 in the early morning, it gradually declined. Bulls frantically sold off their positions, and the central government supplied the market, creating an oversupply. After 10:00 AM, it retreated below 1,930,000. The central government allocated 77 bars at a price of 1,920,000, with the low price falling to 1,915,000. It rebounded slightly at noon, and the afternoon was extremely quiet. As a result, it closed down 65,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 200,040, silver bullion was flat, and the secret discount rate remained at 1.2 to 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Recedes, Hong Kong Dollar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The U.S. dollar also receded slightly, but remained stable after the initial dip. It opened at 2710 yuan in the morning and gradually declined after the opening. The gold market was weak and bearish, and there was active selling of stocks. It retreated to a low of 2630 yuan before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it rebounded to around 2660 yuan. The afternoon was quiet. As a result, it closed down 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar continued to rise, peaking and then slightly declining. As a result, it closed up 15 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to climb, but trading was not as brisk as the previous day. The high price was 540 yuan, and then it receded slightly. The Robbie exchange rate was passively driven up to 650 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 8,000 yuan. All lacked matching transactions due to procedural issues. The official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar remained flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton are Flat and Weak, Cloth Market Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned mediocre yesterday. The Cantonese-produced "Double Horse" yarn's appetite had waned, and its price fell by 30,000 to 40,000. Small and medium-sized yarns were considered stable, but transactions were few. Only the Nanjing merchants handled a few dozen pieces of low-end 20-count yarn. There was considerable trading of 42-count yarn among peers, but the needs of practical manufacturers remained unmet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton telegram reported prices rising by 10 to 18 points. The near-term price was US$29.39, the forward price was US$29.54, and the spot price for middling cotton was US$30.01. The local spot cotton market was stable, but due to the weakness in the bond and gold markets, coupled with Saturday, manufacturers and cotton firms were mostly watching, resulting in very little trading. The cloth market improved slightly because the Cantonese merchants had a stronger appetite for bleached cloth and shirting. The Sichuan and Henan merchants searched for Serge cloth, further boosting confidence and improving the situation. However, other merchants were not very active. Cloth prices rose by 200, 250 to 50 yuan. At noon, the China Textile Corporation opened sales of various cloths at seemingly flat prices, and there was no supply of Serge, so the market became more expensive in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Suddenly Declines</h3>
<p>Down over 100,000 yuan from the previous day</p>
<p>The artificial silk market, which is fluctuating and unpredictable, advanced sharply the day before yesterday, but declined rapidly yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao Youshi silk opened at 1,820,000 yuan, with the lowest asking price briefly exceeding 780,000 yuan. It ultimately traded at 820,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 800,000 yuan, a decrease of 130,000 to 140,000 yuan from the previous day. Miscellaneous brands traded at 650,000 yuan and 600,000 yuan. No. 75 Jinyi Niuguang silk returned to the original price of 1,580,000 yuan from Wednesday. The factory trade was quiet, and trading was scarce. Asking prices remained unchanged. Dachang checkered crepe fell further. It traded at 5,350 yuan in the morning and 220 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of over 200 yuan from the previous day. Trade in Mayer bedsheets was minimal, and asking prices remained between 1,520,000 and 1,530,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Platinum Price Increases, Near-Term Price at US$82.50</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] While the current list prices of major U.S. platinum manufacturers remain between US$53 and US$56 per ounce, the Commercial Daily reported today that some brokers have raised prices to US$80. Major Wall Street firms have also raised the price of platinum for near-term delivery to US$82.50 and the price for forward delivery to US$80.</p>
<h3>Refined White Sugar Reaches New High Price</h3>
<p>Industry Demands Improvement in Opening Sales Methods</p>
<p>The sugar market was initially flat yesterday, then strengthened. Refined white sugar, due to its scarcity, became even more sought after, reaching a new high price. The association set the price for medium-grain white sugar for the 20th at 110,000 yuan in the morning, then slightly lowered it to 107,000 to 8,000 yuan. It closed at 8,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it tightened again to 110,000 to 112,000 yuan. The warehouse receipt price for the 20th was 108,000 yuan, and for the 22nd was 110,000 yuan. Three-Ox refined white sugar was set at 150,000 yuan, a rise of over 10,000 yuan. Raw sugar was also set at a high price of 103,000 to 4,000 yuan. The association opened quotations for Xinghua white sugar at 115,000 yuan to 119,000 yuan, Xinghua brown sugar at 105,000 to 6,000 yuan, totaling over 100 pieces, and Diaojing at over 20 pieces at 96,000 yuan, a rise of 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry held a meeting at the association and decided to request the Taiwan Sugar Company to improve its opening sales methods. The best approach would be to follow the methods used in the first period, which were fairer and more appropriate. The company, which operates Taiwan Sugar, has an absolute advantage and convenience in terms of procurement and transportation. It also has full initiative in terms of opening sales. Therefore, it seems appropriate to provide some convenience to the industry in order to achieve mutual assistance and avoid causing resentment.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Taiwan Sugar Company, publicly dumping sugar is not a definitive solution. The company has nearly 200,000 tons of sugar in stock in Taiwan. Next week, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen and the Maersk Taipei will transport a total of about 10,000 tons to Shanghai. At that time, it will try its best to supply the market in order to effectively suppress prices. He continued, the reasons for this sugar price fluctuation are nothing more than: (1) increased consumption due to summer cold drinks, (2) sugar prices in Tianjin and Hankou being almost 50% higher than in Shanghai, and (3) merchants hoarding, with some even reselling warehouse receipts at high prices in the market.</p>
<h3>More U.S. Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The American President Lines' Dr. Lykes, carrying over 26,770 bales of cotton from Seattle, arrived yesterday morning and is currently unloading at the Gonglixiang Wharf in Hongkou. In addition, the company's George Peake Lykes is also carrying cotton and is expected to arrive in port today.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Is Confirmed to Be Distributed, More Goods Are Expected to Arrive Next Week</h3>
<p>According to a Japanese firm in Shanghai that deals in caustic soda, rumors that a certain foreign firm will soon begin distributing caustic soda are not entirely unfounded. This is because the foreign firm currently has a large quantity of caustic soda in storage and must calculate the amount to be distributed based on pre-war consumption. It is said that the previous distribution was divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D, and the quantity distributed in each category will be more generous than before. However, it is still difficult to predict whether the price will remain the same as the previous distribution, which was 160,000 yuan per unit. However, it is generally believed that foreign firms will not change their consistent dumping policy due to market price fluctuations.</p>
<p>According to a local merchant in this city, a large batch of caustic soda is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. The volume of transactions inside and outside the market was quite small yesterday, with only small, urgent users buying. Because foreign goods are pouring in, people are bearish, and holders are finding it difficult to sell. Most users are also taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Longkou Vermicelli Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli continues to rise in price due to continuous sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The market hit new highs again yesterday. Upstream merchants opened at 165,000 yuan, a rise of over 10,000 yuan. Trade prices were 170,000 yuan, and the outlook remains tight because inventory is low and there is little sign of easing.</p>
<p>Asia Faces 40 Billion Pound Rice Shortage, Comparison of World Rice Production Before and After the War [Reuters, New York, 2nd] World rice production for the 1945-46 season has fallen to 6,200,000,000 U.S. bushels, compared to 6,800,000,000 U.S. bushels in the previous year. The pre-war average was 7,400,000,000 U.S. bushels. According to trade sources, domestic production in the United States may increase in the 1946-47 season. The area most affected by the shortage this season is Asia, where the decline in production is unprecedented. The amount of rice available for export from various countries in the world in 1946 is estimated to be about 2 billion to 4 billion pounds, while the rice shortage in Asia is estimated to reach 40 billion pounds. Food shortages in China, India, Japan, and the Philippine Islands are extremely serious this year.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil and Hog Bristles Exported in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Recent export trade has gradually picked up. Tung oil and hog bristles accounted for the largest share of transactions in a week. The reason for this is that the British exchange rate is gradually returning to normal and the overseas market is expanding. As a result, not only can foreign exchange be increased, but domestic products can also gradually tend to balance with global prices. Since the opening of foreign exchange in our country, although it has absorbed a large amount of materials, the "materials" side has been abundant for a while, and prices have been flat. However, the "labor" side is still rising sharply, so the general price level has not been able to return to normal as expected, and the Chinese people have no way to make an accurate judgment. Now, relying on the overseas sales of export goods, a reasonable adjustment can be made with reference to world prices.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Stipulates Profits on Imported Goods</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The authorities in this city previously strengthened price controls. In addition to continuing to set official prices for daily necessities such as firewood, rice, and certain grains, official prices were also set for all goods sold freely by merchants to show restrictions. Recently, the prices set by stores were still higher than official prices, so it was also stipulated that a fixed profit should be universally added to imported goods. The profit margin must not exceed 20%. Recently, because it has been easier to purchase U.S. dollars than before, the number of goods coming to Hong Kong has been increasing daily, and new U.S. goods have also been arriving one after another. There are especially many Australian goods in the market.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Purchases Chinese Silk from China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>The total amount of loans for spring cocoons this year was originally set at 20 billion, and the actual loan amount was 16.88477 billion as of June 18. The banking syndicate has decided to stop issuing the remaining loans from now on in order to close the account.</p>
<p>The China Silk Corporation approved the first batch of 21 factories exchanging cocoons for silk in March this year. As of the 20th of this month, the factories had paid more than 1,200 bundles of raw silk. The company currently has a large amount of silk in stock and has sent personnel to negotiate a contract with the barter department of the China Trust Bureau. It is heard that the contract stipulates that all raw silk of the company will be purchased by the China Trust Bureau for export.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Affected by Government Bonds, No Formal Trading in the Market Yesterday, Asking Prices Continued to Fall Compared to Previous Close, Another Three Firms Bankrupt</h3>
<p>Several large accounts in Chinese stocks were also affected and ran into problems. Operators who were themselves experiencing difficulty all announced the suspension of business. There was no formal trading in the market yesterday. Sporadic trading only started after 10:00 AM. At the lowest point, Yongsha was at 470 yuan, Mayer was below 2700 yuan, Jingfu was at 190 yuan, Xinguang was at 195 yuan, and Qinxing was at 160 yuan. Afterwards, they gradually rebounded. Bulls and bears mutually offset positions. Although trading was quiet, high prices were seen at noon. Only small and medium-sized unpopular stocks with relatively solid fundamentals saw some trading, and asking prices were also slightly affected. Blue-chip stocks were not quoted. As a result, calculating according to the asking prices compared to the previous close, all stocks fell by about half a percent, except for Qinxing, which was flat. The future situation is extremely uncertain. As for foreign stocks, trading was still normal, and various stocks were passively affected downwards. Yisha reached a low price of 8200 yuan and then rebounded slightly. Except for Jardine, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden, there was little activity in other stocks, and they continued to trend downwards. At noon, they turned sideways. As a result, calculating the previous close, Jardine, BAT, and Wheelock Marden were flat, while Yisha, Yipi, Paper, and Steel all experienced slight declines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problems of bankruptcies and liquidations of Tianyi and Feida have not yet been resolved. It was reported yesterday that Renchang, Tongsheng on the seventh floor of the Securities Building and Damai on the eighth floor of the Overseas Chinese Building on Central Road, three securities firms, also announced bankruptcy and liquidation.</p>
<h3>Qihong Production Prices Are High, Difficult to Reach Agreement in Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to news from the tea producing area in Qimen, Anhui, the new tea has already been released on the market this year and has now arrived in Hangzhou. However, due to the unusually high cost of harvesting, processing, and all payments, the cost is alarmingly high. Although buyers have recently approached the owners to negotiate, the two sides have quoted their own prices, so no satisfactory solution has been reached so far. Other varieties that arrived in Shanghai were still in continuous supply, but holders are maintaining firm prices because they know that tea prices in the producing area have not decreased slightly. As a result, shops and merchants in this street and Suzhou and other places have been affected by their inability to trade as they wish, and their attitude is to wait and see. Transactions have decreased significantly, and the market is unusually quiet. Prices are generally stable. As for the foreign tea market, even Japanese tea merchants are actively seeking solutions. Several firms, including Changxin, Anhui Xinhua, and Zhenhe, are continuing to work overtime and are planning to declare exports within days.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Idle</h3>
<p>In the woolen fabric market, because the summer sales season has passed and the autumn sales season has yet to arrive, and South American woolen fabrics continue to arrive in port, the discount rate remains at two cents. There are few who pre-order or buy, resulting in a decline in both wholesale and retail transactions. There is no proper demand from merchants in various places. General brokers who are running the streets gathering business in clothing stores and tea houses on Changle Road and Qipan Street are also gradually decreasing. As a result, the prices of various goods are mostly flat and weak. Actual Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Lively, Very Little Trading in Rice Market</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Lively, Very Little Trading in Rice Market</h3>
<p>There was still little trading in the rice market yesterday. The goods of each rice shop are allocated by the designated rice firm in the market according to the market price. People's minds are still considered stable. The original prices of each grade of goods have not changed. However, there is little trading in inferior goods. Generally, inferior goods have been traded as high-grade goods. The number of guest goods registered yesterday did not increase. The total number was only 1,699 stone, including 809 stone of white japonica, 50 stone of light and thin slightly, 190 stone of sheep indica, 75 stone of Du indica, 150 stone of non-indica, 224 stone of white, and 201 stone of milled indica.</p>
<p>The trend of miscellaneous grains is strong and stable. Wheat export merchants are actively collecting and transporting goods to Qingdao and other places. Recent arrivals are still strong. Supply and demand in the market is active. Prices continue to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Actual sales of soybeans and broad beans are lively. Transactions are active, and prices are advancing upwards. Today, they rose another 1,000 yuan or so. Because flour rose sharply yesterday, there is fear that it will rise again, which will affect the market for various goods, so there are no transactions for the time being. The oil market is considered stable. Trading is normal, and prices are hovering. Soybean cake rose 200 to 300 yuan along with soybeans.</p>

<h3>A New Feat by Our Air Force's 8th Group: First Flight to Japan</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>Taking Off from Datong Airport, Heading Towards Tokyo</p>
<p>On the morning of May 27th, a silver-white, four-engine aircraft with twin rudders took off from Shanghai's Datong Airport. Zhou Zhirou, Director of the Aeronautical Affairs Commission, silently watched as the aircraft, whose takeoff he had ordered, now took off perfectly. This aircraft was fully fueled and equipped with sound machinery and skilled pilots. Although it was the first flight to Tokyo, Japan, General Zhou was confident that it would arrive safely without any problems. After the aircraft's shadow had become small and distant, Group Leader Wang Shi accompanied General Zhou back to the barracks by car.</p>
<p>This aircraft flying to Japan was a B-24 model number 42461, piloted by Qian Zuren, Captain of the 33rd Squadron of the Air Force's 8th Group. Staff Officer Liu Shanben was in the co-pilot's seat, rotating piloting duties with Captain Qian every fifteen minutes. Navigator Yin Shiyue constantly calculated the heading and distance. Communicator Lin Daoyu, wearing headphones in front of the radio, attentively listened for radio signals. Mechanic Wang Jicheng was responsible for the aircraft's overall mechanical condition, assisted by Mechanic Xiong Daomei. Wang Kun, Communication Chief of the Air Transport Group, would sometimes even sit in the pilot's seat, taking the place of the co-pilot, allowing one of the pilots the leisure to have a cup of tea to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after flying out of Datong, the Yellow Sea replaced the green lands of the Yangtze River Delta below the aircraft. According to the heading of 82 degrees, the flight from Shanghai to mainland Japan was gradually heading northeast. Because the aircraft was encountering a southwest monsoon blowing towards the northeast, with a boost of 20 knots per hour, it was advancing at an airspeed of 168 knots per hour.</p>
<p>Captain Qian Zuren's air operations group was one of the famous thirty groups in the Chinese Air Force. (The first group of personnel sent to the United States to learn to fly B-24 aircraft in 1943 were known as the "Thirty Groups.") This group, like others, hastily flew east across the Atlantic from the United States before the end of the war in 1945, fully expecting to fight the Japanese upon their return. However, during their frozen years in India, they watched the cherry blossoms suddenly wither. The heroes held a newspaper reporting Japan's surrender, regretting that they had not achieved their real mission. After that, they had no choice but to spend their time aging in Shanghai's garrison barracks. Fortunately, the restored land was so vast that the B-24's long-range flight could be like a whale in the ocean, allowing it to fly and swim freely. When the task of flying to Japan fell on them, it was, of course, even more exciting. After going out to sea, the flight altitude gradually increased, stabilizing at 9,000 feet. The Yellow Sea separated the fragmented Japanese islands from China by 450 nautical miles. Since last August, this sea was no longer Japan's inner lake; Japanese aircraft no longer flew over it, and even if ships sailed, it was not of Japan's own volition. The B-24 spent two hours and forty minutes at sea, almost like traveling in a dreamlike state. Not a single ship was seen, nor a single aircraft encountered. The green seawater reflected the unshielded, intense sunlight. Qian Zuren and Liu Shanben put on their flying goggles to look at the wind and waves outside the glass windows. They thought, "If we were bombing Japan, the journey would certainly not be so lonely, and the mood would not be as calm as when flying an air transport mission." They thought, "This is really a bit like taking a car to a desolate forest during a vacation in America, escaping the bustling human world to listen to the flowing springs."</p>
<p>Landing at Atsugi Airport, Welcomed by American Instructors</p>
<p>That morning, Liu Shanben drove a jeep to the American military base in Jiangwan to get the weather forecast, which turned out to be completely accurate. The forecast stated that there were no clouds at sea, which was now confirmed. The forecast stated that the wind speed was 15 to 20 knots, and now they were indeed getting a boost from the wind god, making the airspeed much faster than it would have been without wind. The forecast stated that the clouds over mainland Japan were initially below 5,000 feet. Near Mount Fuji, the endpoint of the journey, there were altocumulus clouds around 14,000 feet. Because Mount Fuji is 12,385 feet high, the flight altitude should be around 13,000 feet. All of this had to be confirmed after entering mainland Japan.</p>
<p>After noon, the aircraft entered the airspace over the Goto Islands, northwest of Kyushu, Japan's island group. Soon, Sasebo passed under the wing. The B-24 drew a line across the northern corner of Kyushu, entering the Iyo Nada Sea. Over Shikoku, the aircraft was still flying at 9,000 feet. Because there were no mountains higher than 9,000 feet in Japan before reaching Kyushu, there were clouds over Shikoku, and the aircraft flew above the clouds, constantly communicating with American radio stations on the ground. Leaving Shikoku's land, it crossed the sea over the Kii Channel, entering the Kii Mountains of Honshu south of Wakayama, and entering the Enshu Nada Sea. It should have proceeded straight ahead on a heading of 82 degrees to the island of Oshima in the Sagami Nada Sea outside Tokyo Bay, and then turned north on a heading of 10 degrees to Atsugi Airport. The route set by the Americans could be said to be very thorough and safe, but the pilots always wished they could arrive a minute earlier. Outside Enshu Nada, they made a turn and entered the airspace over Matsuham. From Matsuham, they brushed past the foot of Mount Fuji on the left. Mount Fuji was indeed majestic, over 12,000 feet high, with unmelted snow accumulating on its peak. The volcanic crater on the summit had wisps of black smoke. This mountain gave the Japanese some exaggerated arrogance, coupled with the delicate and easily withering cherry blossoms, combined with the Japanese virtues of gentleness, forming the Japanese warrior spirit. This crystallization, like the seismic force of the Japanese land strata, played out a tragedy for Japan. The aircraft landed on the 8,000-foot-long runway at Atsugi Airport. A group of American soldiers and personnel from the Chinese mission to Japan were waiting at the airport. Mission Head Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian came forward first. Captain Qian shook hands with an instructor from the United States who was now serving at the American headquarters in Tokyo. The American instructor was quite proud that his student was able to fly an aircraft to Japan, introducing his star pupil to everyone, seemingly showing off even more than the Chinese.</p>
<p>Flying All Over Japan, Detouring to the Capital</p>
<p>On June 6th, the B-24 took off from Atsugi Airport, with Mission Head Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian still as passengers. This time, they wanted to see the major cities scattered like stars on the entire map of Japan (more on what they saw in Tokyo in another report – Editor). They looked at the Imperial Palace from the air, flew south to Yokohama, circled over the Yokosuka naval port, then turned towards Shizuoka, passing over Matsuham again, and flew northwest to the old city of Nagoya. They circled over Nagoya, allowing Zhu Shimin and Dai Jian to observe from the air the future landing docks and camp locations for the Chinese occupation forces. Zhu and Dai also pointed out the camp sites to the pilots. Passing over Lake Biwa from Nagoya was Kyoto. Kyoto was the only city in mainland Japan that was intact, without any signs of bombing. Red tiles and white walls, the scenery was beautiful.</p>
<p>After the aircraft passed through Osaka and Kobe, it reached Hiroshima Bay on the southwest coast of Honshu to see Hiroshima. We all know that the atomic bomb struck Japan, and the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>Staff Officer Liu Shanben said, "Over Hiroshima, we saw four rivers flowing close together into Hiroshima Bay. We couldn't determine whether the Hiroshima city area was at the river's estuary. As we were searching, Mission Head Zhu pointed to a large, square, reddish-yellow field and said, 'This is Hiroshima, with a population of 110,000.' Our spirits were as if pricked by a needle, and we quickly focused our eyes on this world-shaking hundred-li yellow field. It was truly leveled. When buildings are destroyed, you can tell if it was an earthquake rather than a bombing by seeing the direction in which the remaining walls are leaning. There was not much debris in the bombed area. When it was bombed, people and houses were shaken into dust, scattered and falling, so there were no heavy remnants left. Strangely, there were three intact pure white buildings in the yellow field of Hiroshima. The only explanation is that the white color can resist the shock of the atomic bomb? We are not sure.</p>
<p>"At the triangular tip of the square, there were three clusters of houses. This was the area that the atomic bomb did not reach. At first glance, I thought that one of these three clusters of houses was Hiroshima, but Mission Head Zhu pointed it out, and we realized that Hiroshima had been completely wiped out, leaving only these three small tails of suburbs!"</p>
<p>The tall and slender Staff Officer Liu Shanben finished speaking, stood up, and said, "I didn't pay attention as we passed Nagasaki, the captain saw it."</p>
<p>I turned to look at Qian Zuren, who was smoking his pipe, blowing out a puff of smoke, and said, "Nagasaki was also bombed into a square fire field, ash-red in color."</p>
<p>"Just like the stove in our kitchen," Yin Shiyue added with a descriptive explanation. Qian emphasized and agreed with this explanation.</p>
<p>"I saw Nagasaki sandwiched between the mountains and the sea. The mountains are on the southeast side of the city, acting as a barrier to the shock of the atomic bomb. Because the houses outside the mountains were intact, the city of Nagasaki was a Y-shaped area, and the houses on the dike island extending into the sea were still intact. The square was surrounded by green trees and grass. Where the power did not reach, red-tiled foreign houses still stood, surviving the calamity," said Yin Shiyue.</p>
<p>They fully viewed the two atomic squares and then flew south from Nagasaki out to sea. On the way back, they encountered headwinds, plus they wandered east and west, detouring a lot, so they took off at 8:05 AM and didn't fly to the capital until 4:12 PM, flying for a total of 8 hours and 8 minutes before landing at the Datong airfield base outside Nanjing. (June 15th, Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>The Largest Corruption Case in Hunan Province in Ten Years: The Investigation of Hu Mai's Charges</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper's Changsha Dispatch, 10th [of Month]: Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>The corruption case of Hu Mai, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance, was handed over by the Supreme Court for handling last September. After a detailed investigation by the Changsha District Court's prosecutors, he was indicted for hoarding grain and misappropriating public funds for personal gain. The indictment lists the amount of corruption as over 80 million [currency not specified]. On the 12th of this month, the Criminal Court interrogated him again, but Hu has claimed to be severely ill in custody, and the trial has not yet concluded. The details of the Hu case, before and after, are reported as follows: (Editor)</p>
<p>This case is the largest corruption case in Hunan Province in ten years, and it caused a sensation at the time. The prosecutor's indictment stated that the amount of grain that Hu purchased under false pretenses reached over 27,000 *shi* [unit of dry volume], which is shocking.</p>
<p>Hu Mai Served as Director of the Department of Finance During Xue Bailing's Tenure in Hunan</p>
<p>Hu Mai, courtesy name Yan Yuan, is a native of Xiangtan, Hunan. He is 54 years old and the son of the famous Hunan educator Mr. Hu Zijing. Mr. Hu Zijing founded the Mingde Middle School, which was renowned both in the north and south of China, and was on par with Nankai Middle School in Tianjin, known as "Southern Mingde and Northern Nankai." After Mr. Zijing passed away, Hu inherited his father's position and presided over the school's affairs. Hu originally served in the Executive Yuan. When Xue Bailing took office in Hunan, Hu returned to Hunan to serve as Director of the Department of Finance and concurrently as the Director of the Field Tax and Grain Management Office, serving for eight years before resigning this February.</p>
<p>Rumors Said He Broke Away from the Provincial Government, but the Situation Was Very Complex</p>
<p>After the great fire in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province was moved to Yuanling in western Hunan in 1938. In 1939, when Xue Yue took office in Hunan, he ordered it to be moved to Leiyang in southern Hunan, in order to coordinate with military operations. Hu always presided over affairs in Leiyang. In the spring of 1944, when the Changsha battle occurred, Leiyang was threatened, and there were proposals to relocate. At that time, opinions were divided, with some advocating moving to western Hunan to maintain contact with the rear, and others advocating moving to southern Hunan to support military operations. There was a heated debate in the Provincial Government Committee when discussing this matter. Later, after Chairman Xue decided to move the provincial capital to the Jiahe and Lanshan mountain areas, Hu led a portion of the Department of Finance staff and the entire staff of the Field Tax Office to western Hunan. It is said that this was due to the need to supply military grain, so the Field Tax Office had to go to western Hunan. They first worked in Hongjiang and then moved to Yuanling, until the end of the war. At that time, there were rumors that Hu had broken away from the provincial government and was independent. In fact, it was indeed neither fish nor fowl, and the situation was extremely complicated. The fact that the Department of Finance left the provincial government naturally aroused dissatisfaction. At the end of the war, Hu returned to Changsha with Wu Wusheng, and various departments and offices also returned successively, and the provincial government structure was gradually improved. Hu resigned this February and was succeeded by Mr. Yang Ruiling.</p>
<p>Accused of Embezzling Welfare Funds Soon After Resigning</p>
<p>Not long after Hu resigned, some staff members of the Field Tax Office accused Hu of embezzling public funds from the employee welfare society of the office. Hu was summoned. Dozens of Field Tax Office employees were also summoned to testify. After two months of investigation, he was prosecuted for violating grain management regulations and corruption, and Hu and Wen Mingding, the accounting director during his tenure, were detained by the District Court for trial.</p>
<p>The Indictment Lists the Facts: Hoarding Grain for Profit</p>
<p>The indictment lists the criminal facts of Hu and others in three sections:</p>
<p>(1) Hoarding Grain for Profit — In September 1944, Hu established a Supervision and徵收 Office in Changde to purchase and transport military grain and collect old debts, appointing Dai Zhongheng to be in charge. Hu Mai took advantage of the purchase and transportation of military grain to purchase 27,086 *shi* of grain, ostensibly for the food needs of the staff within the purchasing office. He colluded with Dai Zhongheng. The procurement method was either to purchase from large households, purchase county-level public grain, or allocate purchases locally. Most of it was converted into Changde and Taoyuan by allocating it as military grain. Except for about 13,000 *shi*, which was requisitioned for civilian ships to transport to Yuanling, and about 6,000 *shi*, which was sold in Changde, as of the end of December 1945, there were still more than 6,800 *shi* of grain stored in Taoyuan. The grain transported to Yuanling was sold in Yuanling one after another. According to Hu Mai and Dai Zhongheng, this was ostensibly to meet the needs of the 34 staff members of the office for one year, and to regulate the people's food supply. However, the staff's rice was originally issued in kind. In 1945, it was changed to cash allowance, and the Food Department did not announce it until the end of 1944. Why did the office purchase grain beforehand knowing that there would be a cash allowance? Hu Mai claimed: he personally did not buy grain in Binhu Road, but the Welfare Society bought it. In fact, the Welfare Society had been dissolved after losing Leiyang and had not been legally established since then. When the defendants purchased this batch of grain, the price was from 400 to 860 [currency not specified] per *shi*. When sold, the price was from 2,750 to 6,000 [currency not specified] per *shi*. The profit was huge, but because there is still a surplus that has not been sold, the overall profit cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>Second Criminal Fact: Misappropriating Public Funds for Personal Gain</p>
<p>(2) Embezzling and Misappropriating Public Funds for Personal Gain — (A) The Hunan Provincial Field Tax Office pre-sold the local tax assessments for 1943 and 1944. Hu Mai misappropriated 10 million [currency not specified] of the funds collected that should have been turned over to the Hunan Finance Department. According to his claim: it was transferred to Mingde Middle School for construction fees. After inquiring with Xie Zuyou, the acting principal of Mingde Middle School, and the school's director of affairs, they both said that the school had not borrowed money from the Provincial Department of Finance or the Field Tax Office. (B) The expenses of Hu Mai's private residence were listed in the accounts managed by the Provincial Field Tax Office, totaling more than 4.3 million [currency not specified], and even an electric iron was paid for in the public account. (C) Defendant Xiao Zhuxin received 3 million [currency not specified] in public funds from the Food Department in Chongqing in August 1945, and immediately bought American currency at a price of 1,650 [currency not specified] to make a profit. Unexpectedly, the value of American currency later fell, resulting in a significant loss. Hu Mai approved that this loss should be borne by the Welfare Society.</p>
<p>Third Criminal Fact: Using the Welfare Society as a Cover</p>
<p>(3) Various Criminal Acts Under the Guise of the Welfare Society —— (A) Buying and Selling Processing Surplus for Profit. (B) Using the Name of the Welfare Society to Misappropriate Public Funds to Engage in Commerce, Buying Cotton and Monopoly of Salt. (C) Private Appropriation of Grain. Based on the above accusations, Hu's hoarding of grain for profit is a violation of Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management in Extraordinary Times. He used the name of Mingde Middle School to misappropriate public funds, violating Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the two regulations for punishing corruption. He continuously misappropriated 4 million [currency not specified] of public funds within the managed funds, violating Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He spent public funds three times on two banquets, used official vehicles for private use, and used public funds to make up for other people's illegal losses, violating Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the six Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He bought and sold grain processing surpluses for profit, violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He continuously embezzled more than 1 million [currency not specified] of public funds under the name of "Tian Special Account," violating Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. Other defendants, Xiao Zhuxin, Dai Zhongheng, and Wen Mingding, will all be punished in accordance with the Regulations for Punishing Corruption.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>Lu Binshi from Liuzhou, Guangxi, asks: I serve on the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. Last September, I accidentally stepped on a poisonous snake in my residence in Duyun, and my right ankle was bitten and injured. It quickly festered and developed cellulitis. After injecting glucose, bainongqing, silver colloidal, and other injections, and applying anti-inflammatory powder, it finally closed in December. However, after being bitten, my leg became red, swollen, and bent, and even after the wound healed, I still cannot straighten it (only the toes can touch the ground). I was treated by Dr. × of our railway who straightened it surgically and bound it with plaster. Unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the part of the foot not covered by the plaster became swollen, so the plaster was removed, and it had swollen to the knee. The muscles on the back of the foot and heel died, the dead flesh festered again, one tendon of the big toe was broken, and the nerves from the ankle bone down were completely paralyzed and numb. The entire foot cannot move at all. Now it is April again. Although the wound has healed, I still have no sensation, cannot move, and it is often swollen, obviously because the blood vessels are not smooth. I am currently using electric massage (for three months), warm water soaking, sunlight, and other methods, but they have not been effective. I ask, is there any remedy for plaster binding injury?</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] Because the muscles and nerves have all died, resulting in numbness and inability to move, continued massage is needed, which may lead to progress.</p>
<p>(2) Pang Chaojian has two medical questions and requests your column to answer: (1) When I am sound asleep at night, I often grind my teeth, and the sound is very loud. What is the symptom? What is the treatment? (2) I had sores on my head when I was young, resulting in scars. Can they be surgically repaired to perfection? Are there any hospitals in this city that offer surgical repair? Please answer.</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] (1) Test the stool for worms. (2) It is necessary to cut off the scars and then perform skin grafting or suturing. All hospital surgical departments can perform this.</p>
<p>(3) Yunzhu asks Editor, I am one of the readers who support your newspaper because your newspaper has accurate and fair news, and is also able to solve difficult problems for readers. Thank you very much. I got married at the age of 23. I don't know why, but on my wedding night, my hymen had no blood. My husband suspects that I am unfaithful. I know that I am absolutely wronged. I don't know when my hymen ruptured? It has been six years, and the suspicion has not been resolved. I ask the doctor, what method can be used to make my husband trust me? Can a blood test prove it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] The hymen can rupture due to exercise or accidental injury, so the absence of blood cannot be immediately concluded as infidelity. A blood test is ineffective.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum: Overseas Chinese Education Needs to Accelerate Uphill</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>In the past, overseas Chinese education can be described as fraught with difficulties, causing shame and anxiety to the point of tears. The most mistakes and the most disturbing issues in overseas Chinese education were due to unclear responsibilities, where everyone could manage it, yet no one did; and when no one managed it, everyone fought to manage it. Administrative bodies were sometimes established and sometimes not, sometimes established but ineffective, and sometimes had a head but no brains. The people lacked awareness of overseas Chinese education, the organizations could not find specialized talent, and the funding was so little that it was unbelievable. Those sent abroad for inspection were neither officials nor civilians, those sent to teach were not focused, and those receiving training had ulterior motives. Textbooks were compiled for decades, but not a single one was shipped overseas, and they are still stored in wooden boxes in some museum. As a result: native-born children scold their motherland and look down on it; Chaozhou people became cabinet ministers and oppressed Chaozhou people; Quanzhou people became presidents and expelled Quanzhou people!</p>
<p>Looking back on the past is extremely embarrassing. Now that the country has been restored and the land rebuilt, the nation is eagerly hoping to remove the heavy and tattered old clothes from overseas Chinese and replace them with new and fitting garments of the era. If everyone directly or indirectly involved in overseas Chinese education truly awakens from the bottom of their hearts, emerges from a long dream, repents for the past, strives for the future, establishes ambition, and dedicates strength, then overseas Chinese education has reached an absolutely critical juncture that needs to be developed urgently. In the past, people needed overseas Chinese, but now people are excluding them! Without sound education, how can we cultivate their knowledge, morality, intelligence, and skills to survive and develop? Inequality of knowledge is one of the main sources of conflict. Equality of knowledge can promote mutual understanding and unity among nations and can achieve true peace. Buddhism says, "All sentient beings can become Buddhas." Christ said, "All people are children of God, brothers and sisters." The key lies in education. The soul of overseas Chinese reflects the reflection of overseas Chinese education, and overseas Chinese education is the foundation for building and protecting overseas Chinese. Today, the motherland absolutely requires the large group of overseas Chinese youth to become the developers who will bear the fate of overseas Chinese in the future, and at the same time, absolutely requires the large group of overseas Chinese adults to become the maintainers who will bear the current fate of overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese education absolutely needs to accelerate its progress. The ills of the old era must be eliminated, and the style of the new era must be adopted. Qu Yuan said, "Those who have just bathed must shake their hats, and those who have just washed must shake their clothes." Taking advantage of this time of returning to the capital, I will discuss some reforms in overseas Chinese education administration in the future.</p>
<p>(1) Unify Authority: Today's world is a unified world; philosophy advocates monism, and science proves monism. The overseas Chinese education administrative body is an organism, and its authority cannot be fragmented and must be unified. The benefits of unified authority in overseas Chinese education administration are endless, like the benefit of having five senses and four limbs on one person. Education and cultural undertakings overseas should be managed by overseas Chinese affairs agencies, and domestic affairs should be managed by education agencies. Diplomatic agencies act as liaison between domestic and foreign affairs, and consulates are responsible for being the eyes and ears. Party departments handle party affairs and can inform the competent authorities of any views they have on culture and education. The management of cultural and educational groups and social organizations must also be clearly divided between domestic and overseas Chinese affairs agencies. Fortunately, this administrative issue has been resolved and passed by the Sixth National Congress and recently approved and implemented by the 734th Executive Yuan meeting. This is a new era-making epoch in the history of overseas Chinese education. Now we need to see what kind of work will be done. But Rome was not built in a day, and now is just the hard time of going uphill.</p>
<p>(2) Harmonious Personnel: Now that authority has been divided, the personnel of each agency must strive for harmony and avoid friction. Do not let a small matter form a very obvious barrier and draw an indelible gap. Friction and infighting stem from having an "egoistic view" in one's heart. An "egoistic view" leads to an unhealthy mentality, which leads to more misunderstandings. If we remove the "egoistic view" and act impartially, treat the people of other agencies as friends, and gain a thorough understanding, the estrangement will naturally disappear. Acknowledge one's own shortcomings and acknowledge that others may have a moment of wisdom. More importantly, put yourself in their shoes, and you will see that there is no resentment in your heart. Everyone should strive to do their best in their position, ensuring that all activities are for overseas Chinese education and that all benefits go to overseas Chinese education first. Those who run the administration must be exemplary and earn respect. In other words, from now on, everyone should improve themselves, and everything should progress, and the country's status will increase invisibly, and overseas Chinese education will have a bright future.</p>
<p>(3) Strengthen Organizations: The organizations responsible for domestic and foreign overseas Chinese education must be strengthened. A snake cannot move without a head, and it cannot move if the head is broken. People are flying in the sky, why must we always crawl on the ground? Some say that overseas Chinese education organizations are like an old ox dragging a broken cart. How can this phenomenon manage the cultural and educational undertakings of overseas Chinese in 61 countries around the world? Education agencies should have a solid organization to handle domestic overseas Chinese education, and it should be headed by a dedicated person. Domestic education is important, border education is important, and the education of returning overseas Chinese students is also important! The Overseas Chinese Affairs Agency already has an Overseas Chinese Education Department, which should expand its organization in accordance with the overseas Chinese education program passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Fifth Executive Committee. The current Education Guidance Section and Cultural Affairs Section are still not strong enough. Overseas secondary education, national education, higher education, social education, supervision, and even investigation, research, and editing should all be established.</p>
<p>(4) Increase Funding: We only know how to ask overseas Chinese for money, but we do not know how to use money for overseas Chinese. Some even say that the money used to subsidize overseas Chinese education is called "reverse flow." Little do they know that when we use money for overseas Chinese, we are actually asking overseas Chinese for money, and we will be able to ask for more money in the future. There is no investment in the world that is more worthwhile than this. The reasoning is very clear. When a person receives an education, their production capacity increases, and their wealth naturally increases. The money spent on one education earns back far more than a thousand times! The more popular and advanced overseas Chinese education becomes, the more wealth overseas Chinese will have, and the more remittances the motherland will receive. The principle of the amount of overseas Chinese education funding should be proportional to the domestic population and administrative expenditures. The percentage of administrative expenditures for each province's population should also be applied to overseas Chinese, with at least 25% used for overseas Chinese education. Although overseas Chinese do not directly pay taxes, their families can pay taxes, and the country can also collect taxes on overseas Chinese import and export trade. Moreover, hundreds of millions of foreign exchange pour into the motherland every year. To make overseas Chinese education sound and vibrant: First, cultural stations must be established in various overseas locations, good model schools must be added, and a world overseas Chinese "cultural and educational network" must be formed to promote it universally from this center. Second, there must be an overseas Chinese education fund. This fund should be contributed in equal amounts by domestic and foreign sources, completed in stages and regions, once and for all, so that overseas Chinese education can stand firm. Other things that need to be done are just beginning, and they all require funding; otherwise, everything will be in vain.</p>
<p>(5) Use Talent Prudently: Now that authority has been clarified, funding has been secured, and work can be done freely, it is like having handcuffs removed, but the shackles are still on your feet, making it difficult to take big steps. What are these shackles? They are the mediocrity and incompetence of those who handle affairs. It is extremely difficult to find a good staff member who handles overseas Chinese education administration. They should understand education, be familiar with official matters, be rich in ideas, have methods, and, more importantly, understand the actual lives of overseas Chinese. At a minimum, they should be of average talent, be trained in education, have good character, and be willing to learn calmly. Overseas Chinese education is truly a virgin land, and anyone who goes to cultivate it has the opportunity to become an expert in overseas Chinese education as long as they do not give up on themselves. Those in charge should not harbor malice towards their colleagues but should focus on benevolent feelings, distinguish right from wrong, and differentiate good from bad, and those below will also be happy to exert their strength. People are the center of the cause, and people are the foundation of construction. Zeng Guofan, who knew people and made a name for himself in the world, once said that there are only four things to get people: wide recruitment, prudent use, diligent teaching, and strict discipline. The scope of overseas Chinese education is not yet large enough to warrant wide recruitment, but the section on prudent use must be done. If we can use talent as the foundation and know people well and assign them appropriately, a large China will not be afraid of not having good people to use.</p>
<p>(6) Regional Supervision: The administrative agencies are domestic, while the education endeavors are overseas. Overseas, the country is "far away from the emperor," and calls for help go unanswered. Domestically, overseas is vague, irrelevant, and unclear about right and wrong. The estrangement between them is like the disharmony of the human body's blood vessels, how dangerous! In my opinion, the world may as well be divided into fifteen to twenty regions, and each region should gradually establish overseas Chinese education supervisors who are stationed abroad on a permanent basis to manage various overseas Chinese education endeavors. Their main duty is to supervise, promote education, and cooperate with overseas Chinese, schools, and local governments to avoid political activities and avoid all activities that irritate foreigners. To be honest, we are still in the dark domestically. Even if the colonies were offered to us with both hands, we would still be helpless. It is better to focus on doing education well first; otherwise, we will overreach ourselves and be at a loss. Choosing education officials for overseas Chinese is certainly a solemn issue, so they must be chosen well; not just anyone can be appointed. Otherwise, if it is not the right person for the job, what is the point of having this system? These education officials must be first-class talents who study education, have professor qualifications, and not only be able to lead academically, but also be role models for overseas Chinese in terms of moral character. At the same time, they must understand, be enthusiastic about, and have ambitions for the country's construction and the future of overseas Chinese. His place of origin does not necessarily have to be limited to Guangdong and Fujian. Sometimes, sending people from Guangdong and Fujian causes more disputes, so it is better to send people from other provinces.</p>
<p>(7) Teacher Training: The Chairman said, "Officials are the craftsmen of nation-building; teachers should even more so" fill the nation-building with outstanding talent." The philosophical foundation of the special status of modern teachers can be seen in Alfred Victor Oven's "The Educational Wheel." He compares the people's representatives to the rim of the educational wheel, the students to the axle, and the teachers to the hub. Because teachers are the direct environment that controls students and are also the link between the people and the administrative agencies. This explanation is especially meaningful in overseas Chinese education. Moreover, overseas teachers are more important than domestic teachers. Today's teachers are inferior to domestic teachers in both quantity and quality, so it is urgent to train them in large numbers. The best place to train them is abroad, taking materials locally, and the teaching methods can be different, and can be carried out openly or secretly, depending on the environment. If it is handled domestically, there are many problems: (1) Most people's motivation for enrolling is not to teach, but to travel abroad for sightseeing, further education, etc. (2) It is not easy to sign passports, it is not easy to import, and even it is not allowed to land due to discrimination from the government of the place of residence. (3) Travel expenses are huge, and overseas procedures are troublesome. A delay of a year and a half is not uncommon. (4) Schools refuse to use them, and even collude with the local government to deport them. (5) Some do not speak the language and cannot teach young children. (6) Their knowledge and ability are not as good as local teachers, and they become embarrassed after going abroad. (7) They think that they were sent by the central government and occupy a special position in the school, which causes endless trouble for the school. (8) They often seek to transfer to other regions and schools and cannot handle matters. (9) Disputes often arise, and it is inconvenient to handle them. (10) There is no opportunity for regular normal schools, normal classes, night or summer teacher training classes, short-term teacher training institutes, and even correspondence teacher schools to be carried out after training. I advocate that most teachers should be trained overseas, and a small number should be trained domestically when necessary. Foreigners are not used to "training," so we may as well use "lecture" to reduce irritation.</p>
<p>(8) Textbook Compilation and Printing: Teaching materials are the experience of the nation, including textbooks and supplementary materials, which are especially important overseas compared to domestic. We must have the right to education, but we cannot infringe on other people's right to education because of our education standards. All countries and their territories must protect their right to education. Therefore, treaties have beautiful words such as "freedom of education," but in essence, there are many tricks, and there are still endless laws and regulations in local areas that bind us hand and foot. If the power is in the hands of others, then the hands can be loose or tight; and since there is no absolute standard for the law, then the scale will also be stretched and relaxed. There may be affection outside the law, but affection is even more fickle, and the scope of a lack can affect unexpected places. Some countries and some places openly stipulate by law that foreigners are not allowed to establish schools, so they can only open classes at night, as supplementary in nature. Because the environment varies from place to place, teaching materials must be different. Therefore, we cannot simply compile a set of textbooks, but should adapt to local conditions, with variations in location and content, while Chinese, Chinese history, Chinese geography, and civics are absolutely indispensable. Recently, the Elementary School Curriculum Standards Committee resolved to include civics, history, and geography in society. For the sake of emphasis overseas, each subject must still be set up separately. When it is unavoidable, they should be included in common sense, but the teaching time should still be maintained at the amount when they were separate subjects. Writing teaching materials should be based on curriculum standards; the curriculum is the mother, and the teaching materials are the son. At present, we are doing things backwards, having the son first and the mother later. In the future, overseas curriculum should also be started as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(9) Filing Guidance: Filing is getting on track. Overseas Chinese school filing is not only getting on track, but also adding centripetal force to the motherland. Today, only 15% of overseas Chinese schools are filed. We must guide them well, telling them the advantages of filing and the disadvantages of not filing, without using bureaucratic jargon or making trouble for schools. At this National Congress, a representative from a certain overseas location said that they had been running a school for 35 years with 400-500 students. They had been running it for 10 years, and the filing had not yet been completed because it did not conform to official standards. In the future, the filing procedures and forms must be simplified, and the standards must be lowered. The previously stipulated fund was originally a scam domestically. The school temporarily borrowed a sum of money and deposited it in the bank to cover up the eyes and ears of the investigators. The investigators knew it was a scam and turned a blind eye and perfunctorily passed it. I think it is better not to do it than to do it if it cannot be done. We only need a sound board of directors, a principal who is willing to give up everything in their life and devote themselves to overseas Chinese education, and be responsible for the fate of overseas Chinese for generations to come, and they are qualified to file—those who handle affairs should keep in mind that the greatest purpose of filing is only to win their hearts.</p>
<p>(10) Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China: Encouraging students to return to China for further education originally hoped that they would be immersed in the environment of the motherland, live with domestic youth, be baptized by the culture of the motherland, and become the motherland. In the future, when they return to their original place of residence, they will be based in the motherland, thereby improving the lives of overseas Chinese, raising the status of overseas Chinese, and communicating the emotions between domestic and foreign countries. When they return to China, there must be strong guidance; otherwise, a bad impression will be worse than not returning. In the past, the system of reception stations was such that overseas Chinese students only had food, clothing, sleep, and nothing to do, which cultivated idleness and was definitely not a good policy. In the future, "Overseas Chinese Student Guidance Centers" should be established in various commercial ports, especially Shanghai, to provide them with various guidance on further education, employment, and life, providing accommodation and remedial classes. Spiritual training, moral cultivation, nurturing of patriotic attitudes, and explanation of local customs must not be ignored. Domestically, there is no need to set up overseas Chinese middle schools to cultivate their special psychology, and they cannot share joys and sorrows with domestic students. Overseas Chinese middle schools during the war were run in a mess, expelling principals, beating directors, and being indecent. In the future, it is absolutely not allowed to continue like this. Overseas Chinese students returning to China to study at universities should be dispersed to various universities, and it is absolutely forbidden to concentrate them in one school. If some of their subjects cannot keep up with the domestic ones, they can take remedial classes at the Overseas Chinese Student Guidance Center or designate several universities to set up classes to teach, and they will be distributed immediately after passing. If the preparatory class system continues, it can also take on this remedial responsibility.</p>
<p>The above points are just the major points, and personnel is the most urgent, and one person should always be used for one person. Now is an era of doing things, an era of democracy, and an era of clear responsibilities. If you do not do well, the responsibilities are clear, and you cannot shirk responsibility as before. Newspapers can speak, parliamentary organs can speak, and everyone can speak. For the construction of the motherland, overseas Chinese, and the people, education must accelerate uphill!</p>

<h3>Shanghai Defense Corps Issues</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The dissolution of the Shanghai Defense Corps has progressed from rumor to fact. I, having served as the head of the Shanghai West District Corps since its reestablishment, have now held the position for six months. As many concerned individuals have inquired, I wish to briefly outline the situation in the West District Corps for the information of those interested. The West District borders Qingpu and Songjiang to the southwest, and Jiading and Baoshan to the northwest, marking the outermost line of Shanghai. The area is vast, forty *li* from north to south and thirty *li* from east to west. The population is scattered, making control extremely difficult. The strength of the West District Corps, with its nine detachments, is considered insufficient. Observing the police force's deployment, Longhua and Xinjing each have a branch bureau, but the number of police officers is only thirty to forty. Even the police stations in Hongqiao have only eleven officers, Chengjiaqiao has eleven, and Zhudi, Zhenru, and Zhoujiaqiao each have only ten or more. Although Huacao has a police brigade, the number is less than thirty. Furthermore, Qibao, Xinzhuang, Jiangqiao, Wujiaxiang, and Changqiao all lack any police presence. As a result, bandits gather, and robberies occur frequently. Even the police stations in these areas, to avoid the threat of bandits seizing weapons, dare not keep weapons, seeking only temporary peace. If the Defense Corps is dissolved, how will local defense be handled? This is a crucial point that deserves attention. The West District Defense Corps was established last winter. After work began, existing members were registered, and outstanding local youths were recruited as new members, issued firearms, and given training. At the end of the year, they were ordered to assist in winter defense, and detachments of corps members were regularly deployed to assist the military and police. Around the Lunar New Year, to prevent disturbances by criminals and bandits, patrol and standby sentry duties were divided into three groups from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, carrying out defense tasks day and night. As a result, bandits disappeared, and residents could live in peace. These are the real facts of the past, without any exaggeration or embellishment. In May of this year, to prevent trouble makers, the West Shanghai area, being at the forefront of the city, the corps was ordered to assist the military in defense, gathering in Qibao, Hongqiao, Zhenru, and Beixinjing. Most members sacrificed their occupations and energy to undertake guard duty. Although the period lasted only one month, this spirit of service is admirable and memorable. As for the past salary and supply issues of the Defense Corps, according to the organization, there was a district corps under the overall corps, a brigade under the district corps, and a company under the brigade, with each company directly commanding several detachments. Each detachment had a small number of members—about forty-five—and a company had a large number—about one hundred and forty-four. Only the district corps and brigade had paid officers and soldiers (less than ten per unit). Each company had only one deputy company commander, one special affairs officer, and six or seven corps soldiers. Furthermore, the company and detachment commanders and all corps members were volunteers. Not only did they not receive salaries, but they sometimes had to advance expenses. Even the officers' and soldiers' staple and non-staple foods, which were supposed to be 5,000 yuan per person in March of this year, and later increased to 11,000 yuan in March, April, and May, were far from sufficient given the current prices. The shortfall was made up by volunteer company and detachment commanders, enthusiastic locals, and volunteer corps members, who found ways to compensate or donate the entire amount. This special situation is unseen in ordinary military or police organizations. It is worthy of memory and admiration. In fact, the reorganization of the Defense Corps, which began with the reorganization of the standing brigade of the former Defense Corps into a security police force by the Municipal Police Bureau, can be said to have come to an end. Because the current Defense Corps is purely voluntary, and the members are all local, law-abiding citizens who are either farmers or merchants, each with a proper occupation, living and working locally. Their spirit of service and purpose are completely consistent: to protect the local area is to protect themselves. Obeying the law and following orders is now on the right track. Whether local armed forces should be preserved is a matter worth considering. The Shanghai Defense Corps has a long history and a pure organization. Its sole task is to assist the military and police in protecting the local area. During the January 28th and August 13th battles against the enemy, it made significant contributions, which Mr. Jiang Huaisu had already reported to the Military Affairs Commission for inclusion in the war history. There is no need for further elaboration. After the nation's victory and the restoration of Shanghai, the Shanghai gentry and business community jointly reestablished the Defense Corps and formed the Defense Committee, which was directly under the municipal government. The Defense Corps was established with an unified command and administration. By having the civilians run the program under the government, the system was standardized, and the scope expanded. Strengthening training to make it a powerful force is an important part of the defense of the area. Although the unfortunate dissolution is happening now, I sincerely hope that all former members will maintain their past spirit, continue to assist the local area, and work together to stabilize Shanghai and our homeland. Chen Boliang, June 18th.</p>

<h3>Praising Tang Enbo</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>There are many things worthy of praising Tang Enbo for. During the War of Resistance, from Gubeikou to Guiyang, he fought hundreds of tough battles, earning great military merits; after the victory, he was ordered to garrison the Shanghai area, arriving in this most complex environment, accepting surrenders and handling POWs, a heavy responsibility and busy work, worthy of praise; his kindness and amiability, worthy of praise; his political acumen and willingness to humbly study, worthy of praise. But I want to especially praise him for one thing: his recent dispatch of dozens of officers to Shanghai to investigate soldiers illegally occupying houses.</p>
<p>The chaotic days of the initial takeover in Shanghai after the victory are something we no longer have the courage to discuss. Taking housing as an example, many bizarre methods were used that are unimaginable to law-abiding citizens like us. Even now, this confused account cannot be cleared.</p>
<p>Among these things, it is undeniable that many unscrupulous soldiers acted improperly. Although Tang Enbo has left Shanghai and the Third Front Army designation has been abolished, he has not ignored these matters or turned a deaf ear. This is worthy of our support and our praise.</p>
<p>It is said that after the officers arrived in Shanghai, they notified their subordinates that, apart from the forty-four houses of residents and Japanese nationals that had been previously approved for continued occupancy, the remaining seventy-plus occupied houses should be immediately vacated. Anyone who forcibly occupies civilian houses will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Tang Enbo's military discipline is strict, and he is known as the "star of slaughter," so I believe no one will joke with their own head. It is a pity that, until now, only General Tang has taken such action personally. Therefore, I especially want to praise him here!</p>
<h3>Recollections from the India-Burma Front</h3>
<p>— Juying</p>
<p>1.  "God's Creation is Difficult"</p>
<p>In the year before victory, under the close cooperation of the British, American, and Allied forces, we headed towards the primitive area of northern Burma—the Savage Mountains. It was May, and flowers were blooming everywhere in the wilderness. At the Ledo airfield in India, tens of thousands of Chinese troops stationed in India were gathered, lightly dressed, crouching in a corner of the airfield all day, hiding under tents made of raincoats. Like players waiting for the referee's whistle, they waited for orders from their superiors. They had been living like this for more than a week.</p>
<p>One day, a senior American general from the India Headquarters suddenly descended upon us bored soldiers to lecture these Chinese brothers, who had been eager for a mission for so long:</p>
<p>"Dear Chinese heroes, the ground forces are already near the outskirts of Myitkyina. You will soon be airlifted there and forced to land, to cooperate with friendly ground forces to capture the city. What a sacred mission! It has been gloriously placed on your shoulders. In addition to congratulating you, I have a sincere piece of advice that I must tell you: Do not waste weapons, and absolutely respect life. Because it only takes a few seconds to make a rifle, only a few seconds to make a cannon, and no more than half a minute to make an airplane. But it takes God at least twenty years to create a person!" At this point, the roar of the engines at the airfield was drowned out by the shouts of thousands of mouths.</p>
<p>2.  Indian Doggerel</p>
<p>The Chinese army stationed in India grew up in a remote foreign country. Not only did they change their habits of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also their interests shifted with the lively Americans.</p>
<p>One day at dusk, I was walking beside a military camp and happened to pick up a piece of doggerel written by a soldier. The words said:</p>
<p>"Dear mother and father, your son is doing great here, beef jerky, 'A Jiao Hai', big feet, small head."</p>
<p>"Hua Da Ma Da" is Hindi for parents, and "A Jiao Hai" is Hindi for "very good." The fourth sentence needs explanation. British uniforms were not suitable for Chinese people. There were many Sichuanese in the expeditionary force, and the Sichuanese were especially short. The issued leather shoes were all large. The hats were boat-shaped, and most people found them too small.</p>
<p>This kind of doggerel may be comparable to the *yangjingbang* rhymes of Shanghai.</p>
<p>3.  The Origin of "Ding Hao"</p>
<p>Everyone who has been to the rear knows that the Allied forces call Chinese people "Ding Hao". There are different versions of its origin. The version I heard is as follows:</p>
<p>After the Japanese launched the Pacific Offensive, the Japanese army on the Indochina Peninsula advanced rapidly north, quickly capturing Mandalay, the capital of Burma. At that time, in addition to the British and Indian forces, there was also the once-famous Chinese Fifth Army in Burma. They set up a bag-shaped formation there, preparing to open the bag to catch the mice. However, things did not go as planned. Instead of running into the bag, the enemy inserted itself into the bottom of the bag, cutting off the Chinese army's transport line to Yunnan, forcing them to retreat to India.</p>
<p>At this time, a British elite armored regiment was surrounded by a small number of lightly armed advancing Japanese troops in a place called Yannan (transliteration). They waited tremblingly for God's judgment in the encirclement. As a result, after more than ten days of living in terror, a Chinese army relieved them. This was an infantry battalion of the New Thirty-Eighth Division. Because there were so few Japanese, the mission was accomplished under a few scattered bullets.</p>
<p>However, those poor British soldiers who had been trapped for so long were overjoyed to be reborn. They abandoned everything and only knew to run towards India. When they bumped into Chinese brothers on the road, they raised their thumbs and shouted "Ding Hao." From then on, "Ding Hao" became a common phrase among the Allied forces.</p>
<p>The answer to the sentry at night was "OK" for the Chinese, and "Ding Hao" for the British and Americans. "Ding Hao Ding Ding Hao" "Ding Ding Ding Ding Hao". This depends on the American's happiness to increase the comparative degree of this "good". But now the people who call "Ding Hao" may rarely know that it is a sound of gratitude!</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law's Obligation</h3>
<p>— Chuanqiu</p>
<p>A Scotsman asked a doctor to remove his wife's tonsils. After the doctor finished the operation, he asked him for the operation fee. He said that the tonsils should be removed in childhood, and asked the doctor to send the bill to his father-in-law!</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Hand</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Hong Kong foot is a skin disease that grows in the cracks of the toes, causing unbearable itching and being difficult to cure. In Hong Kong, it is called "Hong Kong foot," which comes from the English "Hong Kong foot." In fact, this disease is not unique to Hong Kong. In China, the area south of the Yangtze River is prevalent among people in cities, and it is generally called dampness. It is said that drinking too much alcohol can cause it, but many people who do not drink also suffer from this disease, so it is not limited to drinkers.</p>
<p>Hong Kong foot is also known as athlete's foot. The origin of the disease comes from the Americas. It is said that many college students and people who love sports in the Americas used to suffer from this disease. This disease only causes itching, just like the Chinese call it "癣疥之疾", meaning a minor ailment that is not fatal, but when it itches, it can be enough for you to suffer. However, some people get a kind of sexual intoxication from this. Originally, there were two kinds of techniques in bathhouses: "scraping feet" and "kneading feet." People with this disease enjoy this "scraping" and "kneading," and the pleasure is indescribable! However, this kind of "scraping" and "kneading" also has its disadvantages. That is, after this disease has been "scraped" or "kneaded," its momentum will expand, and it may expand to the point where it makes it difficult for you to walk and causes pain and itching.</p>
<p>Since I left school, this disease has been with me. But I like having it, because having it makes it difficult to get other diseases. If I get other diseases, it will no longer linger with me and disappear until the other diseases are over, then it will come out again. From this, we can know the length of its temperament, and we can also imagine that this disease is not easy to cure.</p>
<p>However, this disease has been attached to my body for many years and has only occupied a few toe cracks. Later, when I arrived in Nanjing, it spread to the palms of both hands. All the commonly used medicines lost their effect, and the more I applied the commonly used medicines, the more it spread and intensified. I was treated in Gulou Hospital for more than ten weeks, but it was still wet and dripping with water, itchy and painful (when it itches, you can't help but scratch, and scratching hurts to the heart and lungs). Every day, the surgeons in Gulou Hospital wrapped both hands with layers of bandages, losing their function. At that time, a friend said that I was a real martial artist, preparing for a duel every day. In fact, I was almost unable to bear the mental pain at that time. With great difficulty, I made it through the winter, and both hands began to recover, but in fact, they only returned to the toe cracks.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when I moved to Hong Kong, because of the unsuitable water and soil, it even broke out on my hands and feet together. Not only was it painful and itchy, but also every blister was filled with pus. I had to prop up my hands and feet high to slightly reduce the pain. After three months of treatment, I was able to take the first step, but I also had to walk with a limp and could not walk fast. In an unfamiliar place, suffering from this disease was really extremely painful. When I went to Pokfulam Road to see Zhang Guangyu at the Scholar's Terrace, I found that he was also in the same boat as me, and even the back of his foot was swollen, but he was able to go to Sing Tao Daily to work every day, so he was not as bad as me.</p>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, it has been much more stable, lurking between the toes, but other diseases have followed one after another. People are always immersed in medicine, and no matter how they toss and turn, they cannot escape the word "disease." But fortunately, I know medicine because of a long illness, and I can prolong my life myself, until the victory of the long-term resistance. This is not in vain for this life. Unexpectedly, because I know medicine from a long illness, Hong Kong foot has become Hong Kong hand these days. At first, there were a few itchy blisters on the palms. Then there was a string of beads, and then a cluster like grapes. This depression, this pain and itching, is hard for anyone to bear. In the end, all the blisters burst, and the water, yellow and clear, gushed out like a spring, endless to wipe away, and the itching became even more intense, like snakes crawling and ants swarming. If I had a real sword in my hand, it would not be difficult to wave it! Unfortunately, I don't have the courage of a "hero to cut off his arm."</p>
<p>This day may have been a day of amnesty, and Mr. Yu Qijiang, whom I had not seen for a long time, came to my humble residence. He originally had the name of "Huang Lu," but he had the experience of Hong Jie in treating this kind of disease. He examined my affected areas on both palms, and silently went out to prepare a large bottle of medicine water and several "ounces" of ointment for me. When he came back, he hurriedly ordered the servant to bring a plate of boiling water, poured a quarter of the medicine water into it, picked up pliers, clamped some medicine water cotton, and frequently wiped the affected areas on my palms. Strangely, as soon as I dipped it on, the unbearable itching stopped immediately; after many minutes, as soon as the heat of the boiling water dropped, he immersed both of my palms in it together, and the affected area became more comfortable, and there was no feeling of dampness. He also used scissors to cut off the skin of the newly grown, unbroken blisters on my palms, told me to soak them in the water again, until the water temperature was completely cold, and then put the ointment on me, without bandaging, and I no longer frowned.</p>
<p>I learned from the box lid of the ointment that it was "toad ointment", but the medicine water was unknown. When I asked Yu Qijiang, he smiled and did not answer, only saying, "I guarantee that you will be completely cured in four days." Sure enough, after four days, the rotten skin was completely removed, and new skin came out; if it does not recur, my "Hong Kong hand," which I have been "living with", may be cut off from me from now on!</p>
<p>America feels food shortages, as do other places. Many butchers in New York close shop because they can't get goods. The group shows many housewives lining up in front of a butcher shop to shop. They are still lucky!</p>
<h3>American Second Landlords</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Rental Conditions:</p>
<p>Obligated to take care of his children</p>
<p>There are black markets all over the world, and there is a housing shortage all over the world, even in the United States. The government's "Price Administration" has racked its brains, but businessmen and landlords have their own gimmicks.</p>
<p>For example, the government has set a limit on apartment rents, but some landlords insist on selling you old furniture. Three sets of old furniture actually sell for $1,200 USD.</p>
<p>One three-room apartment rents for $65 a month, which is fair and reasonable, but the landlord wants you to pay first and then live there. In addition, you have to pay a garden maintenance fee of $15 a month.</p>
<p>The so-called garden is a small patch of grass twenty miles outside the city, which he rents for one dollar a year. This landlord has a total of ten tenants, and he illegally collects $1,800 a year in "garden maintenance fees."</p>
<p>In some places, apartment rental managers want tenants to send gifts worth $100 to get a house, and some landlords want tenants to exchange a car.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that a landlord in one place wants tenants to take care of his children for six days a week, because his wife is a working woman.</p>
<h3>Bandit News</h3>
<p>— Feizhong</p>
<p>"Bandits also have principles," as the ancient saying goes. Although "On Bandits" cannot be written into a good article, it should not violate any prohibitions. Moreover, I have seen three news stories that I cannot help but pick up my pen to write down my feelings.</p>
<p>The first is a local dispatch from a month ago: Bandits robbed a ship and greeted three passengers wearing civil servant badges, "Friends! Don't panic, we are all poor, and we will not disturb you." Even if these bandits were not born as civil servants, they deeply understand the suffering of civil servants. Those who mistreat civil servants are not even as good as bandits!</p>
<p>The second is that a certain big boss returned home after being kidnapped and talked about his adventure, saying: "Among the kidnappers, there was a guard with a junior high school education who could read *The Nineteen Heroes of Qingcheng*. Although he has become a bandit, his will has not been completely extinguished. If he can work for me, I am very willing to promote him." This is enough to show a certain big boss's "magnanimity"; however, there are many junior high school students who have no way out. The kidnapper who read *The Nineteen Heroes of Qingcheng* is only one in ten million. A certain big boss uniquely favors him, but how much can it benefit society? However, after escaping the danger, he can donate money to help refugees and never forget to promote the younger generation (although only limited to guards in the bandit's den). A certain big boss made up his mind to save people from this unfortunate incident, which is also very valuable.</p>
<p>The third is that the fish market manager's house robbery case was solved, and the leader of the gang was a former teacher. It is not surprising that teachers become robbers. You must know that there is a theorem to be followed when teachers become robbers. How can you not know that the motto "Misleading children leads to male bandits and female prostitutes" has long been circulating? The current teachers who are forced to live a hard life are unintentionally misleading their students. Why not directly become robbers? Otherwise, do you have to wait and think of ways to make money from your wife and daughters?</p>
<p>Looking at the three news stories, the conclusion is another ancient motto: "Only when food and clothing are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace."</p>
<h3>Miss Morgenstierna, daughter of the Norwegian Ambassador to the United States and Miss Norway, has been selected as Miss United Nations 1946. Forty-one beautiful girls from different countries participated in the competition. The grand dance party during the election was attended by 1,500 guests, causing a sensation in the diplomatic and social circles of Washington.</h3>
<p>A Collection of Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Investigation and Hidden Inquiries: Speculation Turns into Fact?</h3>
<p>— Wu Ling Ren</p>
<p>The housing allocation committee for various government departments is facing a difficult situation because many empty houses left behind by Japanese residents have been occupied by military personnel, making it impossible to allocate them. It is said that telegrams were sent to the highest authorities of the army, navy, and air force in the capital, as well as to the Third War Area, hoping for a swift investigation and an order for the occupants to vacate the premises. Commander Tang has now dispatched personnel to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation and enforce the order. However, the military authorities in the capital seem to have taken no action yet, which is generally considered strange. Some speculate that alongside the "open investigation," there must be a "hidden inquiry" already underway. Once the truth is uncovered, a swift and decisive action will be taken, catching the occupants off guard. Wouldn't that be even better? This is mere speculation, but one hopes it will become a reality.</p>
<p>The registration of dance hostesses reached over 1,500 by the 20th of this month. According to surveys and statistics, "these dance hostesses all cite financial difficulties as their reason for dancing. Most of them are illiterate, with less than one in ten having attended primary school, and those with a secondary education are rare." Perhaps a small note should be added below: "But most can speak a few phrases of pidgin English."</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of the Hong Kong government, the Macau government is adopting an evasive attitude in our negotiations to extradite Chinese traitors. We offer a word of congratulations to the "Shehe" Shipping Company, as its business will surely flourish from now on.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that the Jianghai Customs is ordering dozens of large anti-smuggling vessels from the United States to intensify its efforts to resume anti-smuggling operations. This news is by no means the death knell for tax-evading and smuggling merchants. Moreover, it is unknown when these dozens of large vessels will actually arrive.</p>
<p>Since Mayor Wu implemented strict controls on food supplies, the market prices for rice and grain have indeed been very stable for the past half month. The common people are celebrating with joy. It is hoped that the authorities will remain vigilant and maintain strict oversight, ensuring that the "tiger" cannot escape again.</p>
<p>The ceasefire has been extended by eight days, and another special edition of the newspaper has been issued.</p>
<h3>Overseas Shortwave Broadcasts</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko used to be a prominent Red Army general in the Soviet Union, but later became a "forgotten man," rarely mentioned in newspapers. Recently, he has been appointed as the Soviet ambassador to Abyssinia. Timoshenko is a renowned defensive strategist, but not an outstanding political figure. This appointment has attracted attention in British and American political circles.</p>
<p>Marshal Georgy Zhukov, a famous Soviet general, has a close personal relationship with General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff. The two often exchange letters.</p>
<p>American propaganda experts are planning to screen "The Great Dictator" in Berlin on a trial basis. They will first select a group of viewers to test whether German audiences will find this comedian's masterpiece hilarious.</p>
<p>After the war, strikes have repeatedly broken out in the United States. The large-scale strikes in the automobile, steel, coal, and railway industries have shocked the world. The losses are incalculable. According to the June 10th issue of "Newsweek," strikes in the first four months of 1946 resulted in the loss of 70.2 million working days.</p>
<p>The loss of production is unprecedented: 1.06 million automobiles were not produced, 9 million tons of coal were not mined, 1.3 million tons of steel were not smelted, lead production decreased by 60%, and steel production fell by 75%.</p>
<p>The losses from the strikes have directly affected foreign countries. For example, Italy relies entirely on the United States for its coal imports, so its reconstruction plan has been greatly hampered. Famine-stricken Europe has lost millions of tons of food.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is considering implementing daylight saving time nationwide to reduce coal consumption. In addition, the United States may have to adopt a coal rationing system this winter.</p>
<p>Bernardes believes that the massive occupation force is an obstacle to economic recovery and, therefore, an obstacle to peace. He believes that it is unnecessary. He says that a million eighteen-year-old American soldiers walking around the streets cannot guarantee that Germany will be completely disarmed. Instead, outstanding scientists and engineers must be employed to monitor Germany's disarmament from beginning to end and report to the capitals of the Allied powers at any time. He believes that small, mobile units that can be dispatched to trouble spots at any time are more appropriate. Air power and air transport units can also be utilized.</p>

<p>Film and Drama</p>
<h3>A General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama (Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>7.  "Dream of the Red Chamber"</p>
<p>The original name of this play was "Yu Lei" (Oppressed Thunder). The playwright's theme in the play is: like oppressed thunder in autumn, although it is rumbling, there will be no rain or lightning. It is also said to be like a person who has many words to say but cannot say them, forever stuck in their throat. This time, "Yu Lei" was performed in Shanghai under the name "Dream of the Red Chamber" because "Yu Lei" is an adaptation of a section from the old novel "Dream of the Red Chamber." Therefore, using "Dream of the Red Chamber" to replace "Yu Lei" is not entirely unacceptable!</p>
<p>In the adaptation of the play, many aspects rely on the novel for help. If someone who has never read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" watches the play here first, they will be confused. Someone who has already read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" will not pay attention to the many loopholes in the play and will be satisfied with the play. In the play, the emotions of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu can be seen in several incidents involving sachets. However, Jia Baoyu's forgetting his sister when he sees his cousin, and his love for combing girls' hair, are not expressed in the play. Similarly, Lin Daiyu's narrow-mindedness, represented solely by her sadness caused by Xue Baochai's sending a small gift, is unreasonable. Using the sachet incidents to express it is also insufficient. Xue Baochai's generosity is not evident in the play, which is not to say that the actress is to blame, but rather the play itself. At the same time, her scenes with Jia Baoyu only begin at the wedding; before that, she hardly speaks a word to him. Therefore, we cannot see Xue Baochai's character and her feelings for Baoyu. It would not be an exaggeration to say that she is a complete stranger. However, in the wedding scene, Baochai clearly calls out "Baoyu." From this, we can see that they are not strangers.</p>
<p>The character who is written about the most in the entire play is Zijuan. The playwright writes her very well, appropriately, movingly, and fittingly. She almost runs through the entire play. She serves Daiyu, deceives Baoyu, and accompanies Baochai as a dowry maid. From beginning to end, only Zijuan can represent everything because she understands the emotions of both sides and witnesses the transformations of both sides. Other characters, such as Baoyu, only know one side; Daiyu disappears in the second half of the play, and Baochai is sporadic. Therefore, I say that the most important character in this play is Zijuan, not Baoyu, Daiyu, and certainly not Baochai. It is only a pity that when Baoyu is about to leave, Zijuan is present but cannot express the words that the audience wants to hear, giving the audience's sorrowful feelings an opportunity to disperse.</p>
<p>Apart from the old-fashioned marriage poisoning children and grandchildren and advocating for freedom of marriage, it is difficult to find any other theme in this play. For example, the corruption in the Rongning Mansion, as depicted in "Dream of the Red Chamber," cannot be found at all in this play. This is excusable for the adapter of the play, because his title "Yu Lei" is his best explanation.</p>
<p>The playwright explains in writing that this is not entirely "Dream of the Red Chamber." The purpose of writing this play is to write about the liberation of human nature. Apart from Baoyu becoming a monk, there is no other proof of this. Moreover, this point still comes from "Dream of the Red Chamber." I think the playwright said this to cover up the inadequacies in the adaptation of the play.</p>
<p>The play's music uses Chinese music. Whether it is properly matched and appropriate can be left to the experts to criticize, but I think this music is very consistent in tone with the stage set and the ancient-looking costumes of the actors.</p>
<p>In the entire play, I personally like the atmosphere of the last scene the most. It gives people a sense of melancholy. The loud and monotonous chimes can be said to be a force, but it does not rely entirely on it. The strength of the play, director, and actors are certainly not wasted here.</p>
<p>8. "The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky"</p>
<p>"The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky" is a recent script written by Mr. Hong Shen. This script is more complete than some of his previous works. However, in this play, we can see that the playwright only uses political democracy as a slogan and does not integrate it into the plot. Therefore, it becomes an outer garment rather than the backbone of the play. The entire plot is only a series of scattered stories intertwined. Because of this, the play's depth is lost, making it seem superficial.</p>
<p>In the rear area, the drivers on several highways, later uniformly called "drivers," are a very complex group of people. Some may be university students with a higher level of knowledge; others may be illiterate with a lower level. There is also a big difference in the level of technical skill. Some are veteran drivers who are fast and stable in their cars and never have problems. Some just learned to drive and are prone to accidents. Some drivers only drink some wine and go to bed at dinner time whenever they stop to rest. Some must have a girl to accompany them. Some are even more extraordinary, having four or five homes along a highway, so no matter where the car stops, he can go home to enjoy himself. This kind of thing was not a big deal when "the motor roars and gold piles up." All the characters in "The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky" are brought by the driver Yang Shixing, so there is this story. This driver is neither the best nor the worst person in his class. He plays with prostitutes, but he is not harsh to them. He carries contraband, but does not excessively exceed the quota. Drivers like this should be considered good!</p>
<p>The next character is the prostitute Wang Guifang. This is a pitiful creature. We can easily see this type in small county towns, a type of weak-willed and unconscious degenerate. Most of them are forced by life! The so-called willing to degenerate only exists for the young mistresses and young ladies in wealthy families who live in a paper-drunk and gold-obsessed environment. She, Wang Guifang, a lower-class prostitute who has already degenerated, only makes me feel sorry for her and does not make us dislike her. She only makes us feel that she is poor, and does not make us feel that she is vulgar. These two characters - Yang Shixing and Wang Guifang - are played by Xie Guan and Ba Ling. The characters they portray are precisely the characters carved out in the play. The most cunning character in the entire play is Mr. Lin. Because he wanted to seize other people's wives and daughters, he exposed other people's mistakes and accused the other party of being a traitor. Unexpectedly, he himself was detained for treason. As a result, he had a conflict with the owner of Xing Inn and was injured. This character should be so changeable. But the actor is just flat and faint, burying this character in this low-energy performance, which is such a pity!</p>
<p>9. "Wuthering Heights"</p>
<p>It is said to be an adaptation. The original work is a successful work by the sisters Emily Brontë and Charlotte Brontë in the 19th century. There is a Chinese translation by Liang Shiqiu. Later, the film "Wuthering Heights" co-starred by Florence Eldridge and Merle Oberon was based on this novel. This time, the script is probably based on the film adaptation.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of an adapter, most people adapt other people's works because they are particularly satisfied with them or because there are special stage effects that can be achieved. They will never say, "This thing is written too badly, let me adapt it into a masterpiece." Because of this, we always take masterpieces as the blueprint for adaptation. After the adaptation, whether the value still maintains its original standard is very questionable. It would be even more amazing if it could be surpassed. It is extremely rare for someone like Shakespeare to turn other people's poor works into immortal masterpieces. The adaptation of this play cannot escape this fate either.</p>
<p>The most reprehensible point in the adaptation is making Salingzi pregnant with He Gang's child. Because of this, noble feelings become inferior carnal desires. What is even more ugly is getting married after being three months pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage that kills the child. Perhaps the playwright did not think of this at the time, and only thought about how to strengthen the feelings between Salingzi and He Gang, so this consequence was produced.</p>
<p>In the performance, although the atmosphere is not unified throughout, it can be clearly seen that the actress who played Salingzi gave it a lot of help, making the atmosphere thicker and more of a tragedy. At the same time, what we can feel is that the inner sadness becomes an external sadness.</p>
<p>If we put the atmosphere aside and don't talk about it, then we can draw a line with Salingzi's marriage. We can see how happy and lively she was before her marriage, and how painful and depressed she was after her marriage. These can make us know why she is like this.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Shangguan Yunzhu, who played Salingzi, is the best. At least she did not let this character fall into mediocrity. What we fear most in any performance is the mediocrity and lack of ups and downs in the actors' acting skills. They should use their acting skills to make a character come alive on stage! Otherwise, these so-called male and female actors should be driven off the stage!</p>
<p>The above three plays were all performed by the New Art Troupe at the China Theatre. If we talk about the performance level of the three plays, it should undoubtedly be "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>

<h3>New Film Criticism: Battlefield Lovers</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>This is not a nonsensical American film, but a more meaningful one. It depicts an American musician who is hired by the Soviet Arts Committee to perform everywhere in the Soviet Union and is very popular with the Soviet people. At this time, he meets a Soviet girl, and they fall in love during a night of wandering in Moscow and eventually get married. After marriage, they both perform everywhere. Unexpectedly, the German army attacks the Soviet Union, driving straight in. Because the woman misses her family, she leaves her husband and returns to her hometown. Because the war is unfavorable, it will affect the woman's hometown. Seeing that his wife has gone and not returned, the American musician obtains a pass and goes to look for his wife. On the way, he encounters enemy planes bombing, and after many difficulties, he arrives at the woman's home and sees that the house has been bombed and his father-in-law has been killed. He then sees enemy planes strafing and shooting dead a Soviet child. At this time, the enemy troops are about to arrive, and all the villagers burn all the rice in the fields and organize a guerrilla team to prepare to fight the enemy. The musician John Meredith and his wife Nadien also want to join the guerrillas. But they hope that the couple can return to the United States and tell the Americans about this situation so that the Americans can help them. So they return to the United States to put on a grand musical concert for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This is starred by Robert Taylor and Susan Peters, and it cannot be said to be too bad. However, the Soviet flavor in this film is not strong. Only the scene where John and Nadien get married and the villagers dance makes people feel like this place is in the Soviet Union and people are dancing. Other than that, there are only some Soviet street scenes. However, this is not an easy task, because he has moved far away from those nonsensical things.</p>
<p>The mistake lies with the producer and director. They should have been very clear about Cary's personality and acting skills beforehand, whether he is the most suitable for this play. If not and he must be used to star in it, then the simplest thing is to add more "his type" of scenes so that he can show his genius and make the play greatly excel. Or even ask the screenwriter to revise the play for Cary. Otherwise, they should not have hired Cary! Having used Cary, then the child's acting is not bad, but the director still lacks research; because Cary is suitable for exaggerated comedy, for Cary, the child should be replaced with a shorter one. If the little fat boy in the young village can come over, there will definitely be better results.</p>
<p>I quite agree with the play's writing and intention, but I do not agree with the person in charge's random selection of people and random shooting of the play.</p>
<p>Actor-wise, Cary is still competent, the child is not bad, and Jeanne Crain is still a young actress who has just emerged here, with no good or bad to say.</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin's New Work Comes Out</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>The generation's comedian Charlie Chaplin has been away from the silver screen for a long time. According to recent telegraphs: Chaplin has begun filming another new work since June 1 this year. The new work was originally named "Bluebeard", but has recently been renamed "Comedy Murders". It is still directed and starred by Mr. Zhuo, and is scheduled to be completed within ten months. Zhuo's production is known for its prudence. The filming time of this film has not exceeded one year. In terms of his personal history in the film industry, it can also be said to be the first time ever! I think that when all the flowers are in full bloom next year, movie fans all over the world will be able to see this generation's comedian on the screen again.</p>
<p>"The Great Dictator" was a work by Mr. Zhuo before the outbreak of the Japanese-American War (this film has not yet been shown in Shanghai, and the Shanghai audience unanimously thinks it is a pity). Since "The Great Dictator" and the start of filming of this new work, Mr. Zhuo has been out of the film industry for six years. During these six years, there have been many changes in Mr. Zhuo's private life. Although Mr. Zhuo is getting older, he is still as romantic as ever in Hollywood!</p>
<h3>The Story of "Distant Love"</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Professor Xiao gave a speech at the Youth Hall, which aroused the dissatisfaction of his lover Zhu Manli, so she left without saying goodbye. Seeing this, Chang quickly ended his speech and chased after her, and Zhu then proposed a marriage condition to Chang. Without any choice, Hui resolutely came.</p>
<p>Professor Xiao's housekeeper Auntie Zhen was washing and drying clothes, and the rickshaw puller came forward to tease her. She resisted, so the two fought. Upon hearing this, came out and reprimanded him. The rickshaw puller falsely accused Auntie Zhen of stealing rice. After Wu Yanan interceded, the suspicion was dispelled.</p>
<p>On the day of Xiao and Zhu's engagement, the bride did not arrive, so Xiao announced that he and Zhu had broken up again and that he would create an ideal wife. That night, Xiao discovered that Auntie Zhen was secretly reading a book. So he took Auntie Zhen as the object of creation. Gai Professor taught Auntie Zhen every day, and also received social training and etiquette.</p>
<p>Once Auntie Zhen went upstairs to ask Wu for advice, and it happened that a seminar was being held in Wu's room. Auntie Zhen heard a man calling for oppressed women, and Wu also talked about Auntie Zhen's experience, and Auntie Zhen was greatly moved.</p>
<p>The old father came to tell that Auntie Zhen's brother had been arrested. Auntie Zhen was greatly grieved and fell into her old father's arms, crying bitterly. A few days later, his brother came to say goodbye, saying that he did not want to be a beast and was determined to join the army to fight against Japan!</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident occurred, and Auntie Zhen's father and brother sacrificed because of it. She had been transformed and was no longer what she used to be. Now she is busy participating in nursing classes, serving injured anti-Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>On the way, he saw Auntie Zhen and Li Qun together, and he became jealous and followed them. Suddenly, he was scattered by the crowd parade, so he went home alone.</p>
<p>He found Auntie Zhen back in the hospital, and Li came to visit, but he refused. Wu therefore quarreled with Xiao, and Zhen came to send them out, crying bitterly because she was disappointed with his attitude.</p>
<p>On the eve of the July 7th Incident, the Japanese army was conducting exercises in Pingjin, and the war began. Xiao did not want Auntie Zhen to participate in any anti-Japanese work. Wu came to visit, and Auntie Zhen complained to him and inquired about the current situation. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred, and Auntie Zhen resolutely went out to participate in the work.</p>
<p>Xiao was invited to leave Shanghai for Hankou, and entrusted his wife to Wu. The National Army withdrew from Nanjing, and Xiao sent a telegram urging Auntie Zhen to leave Shanghai for Hankou. Auntie Zhen then left Shanghai with the refugee ship, leaving the older children with Wu, and taking the younger children with her. She was bombed on the way, and her young son died tragically.</p>
<p>Received a call knowing that Auntie Zhen had arrived in Hankou, although three or five young people came to ask for work, he refused to pay the tax and went straight to pick up his wife. At the pier, she found out that Zhen was a soldier. After returning home, was dissatisfied with Auntie Zhen's military uniform and rudeness, and Auntie Zhen was also tired of the decadent life of. Just when female soldier A Tang came to visit, she went to work in the area with her. He was shocked and chased to the work team, begging Auntie Zhen to return, but Zhen did not allow it, so he broke up.</p>
<p>When Wuhan was withdrawn, Xiao Yuanxi went to Guilin to visit Wu Yanan. Wu told her that Auntie Zhen had joined the service group led by Li Qun.</p>
<p>When Guilin was withdrawn, Xiao walked on foot. He met Wu on the way and went to the service group to find Zhen together. Xiao Xiqiu wanted to restore their relationship, and Zhen replied that they would talk about it after the victory.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union joined the war and Japan surrendered on its knees. Xiao arrived in Shanghai and returned to his old house. The eldest son asked his father about the situation on the battlefield, but Xiao could not answer.</p>
<p>Shocked to return from the welcome banquet, he saw that the eldest son and Auntie Zhen were together. Gai Sui sought to reunite, and Zhen had the intention to agree. Because she occasionally saw Xiao's erroneous views, she became furious and debated with Gai. Xiao insisted on his own opinions, so Auntie Zhen left. Together with Li Lianqun, she ran to the future. Pursuing distant love.</p>
<p>Professor Xiao then announced his marriage to Zhu Manli during his birthday celebration, and said that Auntie Zhen had exceeded himself after the transformation.</p>
<h3>Longing for the Fantastic</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>Cary Grant's previous films always gave the impression of a "comedic figure," like "Bringing Up Baby," which was recently shown at the Cathay. However, this "Longing for the Fantastic" is completely different.</p>
<p>The play stars Cary and a child. The story is about a little caterpillar. The news reporter's cleverness and the scientist's singularity, as well as the selfishness of mankind, are all deeply satirized. There is no love story, so the style of the play is quite high.</p>
<p>Cary plays one of the selfish humans. His personality seems ill-suited to the role. Only the scene where the child follows behind him playing the harmonica and the part where he peeks through the peephole of a shoebox show Cary's acting style. In other parts, he doesn't seem very satisfying. It's as if he shouldn't act this way. Is it a lack of acting ability? No, in other areas, like "Bringing Up Baby" and "My Favorite Wife," his acting skills are exceptionally high, like a pointed mountain. Therefore, the fact that he can use such a large name on advertisements is the best evidence. Now, this "Longing for the Fantastic" is outside of his peak performance, so his performance seems somewhat incompatible and cannot fully satisfy people. An actor doesn't necessarily have to have many-sided personality. Not having many-sided personality is not necessarily a failure. As long as he has superhuman acting skills in one area, he will still be admired and praised by most people. Cary is that kind of person.</p>
<h3>Film and Theater News</h3>

<p>(4) Persistence of Vision</p>
<p>When the human retina receives a stimulus from the optic nerve, visual perception does not occur until the excitation is transmitted to the brain center. This transmission time is called the visual latency period. The length of this latency period varies depending on the observed object and individual eyesight. For example, when red light enters the eye, it is perceived as gray for only one-tenth of a second. As time passes, it is perceived as yellow and then orange. Only between one hundredth and two- or three-tenths of a second does the true color become visible.</p>
<p>Since vision requires a latency period to begin, it also does not disappear immediately after the sensation. Examples include seeing a flame as a wheel or legs as lines. These are all phenomena of persistence of vision. In terms of color, rotating red and black blends to become [omitted], and black and white mixes to become gray. The stronger the light intensity, the shorter the latency period. The colder the color, the longer the persistence. Typically, the persistence of white is about 0.7-0.8 seconds, yellow is 0.083 seconds, red is 0.096 seconds, and blue is the longest at 0.122 seconds. Furthermore, when the human eye suddenly receives strong light and then closes, it transitions from positive afterimages of blue, purple, green, and red to a negative black image. This also illustrates that the persistence phenomenon varies in length depending on the wavelength of each color of light.</p>
<p>The color image caused by persistence of vision is called a complementary color. For example, staring at red and then shifting the gaze to another place will result in a complementary green-blue color being seen. Scholars explain the complementary color afterimage by suggesting that during the sensation, the part of the retina sensing red undergoes a chemical decomposition process. This process gradually strengthens and then weakens. When the gaze shifts to a grayish-white object, all types of optic nerves responsible for red, blue, and green should be activated. However, the optic nerve responsible for red is already weakened, so the remaining green-blue sensation is dominant, resulting in the perception of a green-blue afterimage.</p>
<p>The influence of complementary color afterimages on subsequent color perception varies in strength. The inductive force of red and green is stronger, while blue, yellow, and purple are weaker. Furthermore, saturated colors have the strongest force, while unsaturated and dark colors are weaker. Designers of stage sets and cinematographers of color films must pay attention to the effect that complementary color afterimages give to a subsequent shot. Only in this way can the complementary color afterimage of the previous shot, plus the actual color used, equal the correct color intended.</p>
<p>At the same time, complementary color afterimages can also affect the change in color at the point where two colors meet when they are placed next to each other. For example, when red and purple are placed side by side, red appears slightly orange, and purple appears slightly blue. Designers who want to make the division between colors clear should ideally use complementary color lines in between. The use of gold thread in ancient Chinese costume design also aims to make the two colors absolutely distinct. To harmonize colors, intermediate colors should be used in between, or the same color should be used with varying degrees of saturation.</p>
<p>Complementary color afterimages can be used in projection. Bertolt Brecht once conducted an experiment: he used an ordinary flat mirror and, slightly distanced from the mirror surface, covered it with a piece of colored glass that was not too dense. He then projected strong floodlights onto it and placed a pencil diagonally in front of the mirror. Two projections could be seen: one was the complementary color, and the other was the color of the glass. These two colors were visible separately. If this kind of setup were used to project various scenes onto a cyclorama, then the decoration of beautiful double images would have unlimited potential for development.</p>
<p>(5) Color Contrast</p>
<p>Understanding the phenomenon of persistence of vision makes it easy to understand the reason for color contrast.</p>
<p>Color contrast not only carries special value in design, but also wields deadly power in painting, stage makeup, clothing, and stage set design. This will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>(1) Luminance Contrast: When black and white are placed side by side, white appears whiter, and black appears blacker. When gray is compared to white, it appears darker. When compared to black, it appears lighter. If color is compared to black and white, the luminance will also change significantly. For example, saturated yellow is most prominent against a black background, followed by orange, green, and red. Blue and purple, on the other hand, are黯然失色 ("become overshadowed," "lose their luster"). This follows the order of luminance from highest to lowest when each color is saturated. The opposite is true against a white background: blue and purple are most prominent, while yellow is faintest. Against a gray background, the phenomenon of contrast of each color is determined by whether the shade is closer to white or black.</p>
<p>(2) Saturation Contrast: Saturation cannot be separated from luminance and hue. For example, when indigo pigment is applied to paper, it has its own saturation. However, when compared to yellow, its saturation appears very high. When compared to azure, its saturation decreases and it seems black. The same is true for emerald green compared to grass green, and vermillion compared to bright red. As described above, comparing two different colors has the effect previously described. Comparing the saturation of the same color with a color that has been diluted with powder and water also has the same effect. Therefore, it is known that the saturation of color perceived by the human eye also has a variable standard due to persistence of vision.</p>
<p>(3) Hue Contrast: As in the previous example of red and purple being placed side by side, red appears slightly orange, and purple appears slightly blue. This proves that when two different colors are placed next to each other, not only do the hues change, but the saturation also changes. However, when two complementary colors are placed next to each other, the saturation increases without changing the hue. Designers who are skilled at using lines base their skill on this principle.</p>
<p>(4) The sensation of protrusion and recession caused by contrasting colors: This is essential knowledge for face makeup and scene painting.</p>
<p>Protrusion - Recession</p>
<p>White - All colors</p>
<p>All colors - Black</p>
<p>Yellow - All colors except white</p>
<p>Red - All colors except yellow and white</p>
<p>All colors painted black - Brown, purple</p>
<p>Blue gray - Blue, green</p>

<h3>Conservatism and Progress</h3>
<p>— Tradition First</p>
<p>General traditionalist conservatives these days often lament, "People's hearts are not as they used to be; the morals of society are declining." They feel that the world is degenerating, and that the Golden Age was before the Three Dynasties. At least the Duke of Zhou, King Wen, King Wu, and Confucius could still be considered a bit orthodox, but later on, morality simply declined and people's hearts became treacherous. But our "high opinion" is exactly the opposite of these traditionalists. We believe that society is constantly progressing. People today are stronger than the ancients in terms of adapting to the environment, the efficiency of their work, and their moral understanding. Although Confucius was able to assist Duke Ding in meeting with the Marquis of Qi in Jiagu, if he were to attend the current Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference with just that bit of his ability, I think the old master would have difficulty coping. Furthermore, in terms of morality, we acknowledge that women are the same as men. We don't have many extravagant and fabricated rituals. We advocate for freedom and equality. In many of these areas, we are more advanced than the ancients. "People's hearts are not as they used to be" is a fact, but we would say "the morals of society are ascending!" The evolution of society must be forward!</p>
<p>What force drives the evolution of society? We can say that it is produced by the opposing yet complementary forces of movement and stillness. Movement is a driving force. Human beings have needs that can never be satisfied, and they cannot but explore forward. Movement is a process of destroying the old and creating the new. Stillness is a force of preservation. When people seek out a new technology to satisfy a new need, they cherish and preserve that technology. Stillness is a conservative state. In terms of the process of social activity, stillness refers to existing social systems, while movement refers to social creation and revolution. Zhou Lianxi said: "The Non-Ultimate is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates Yang. When movement reaches its extreme, it becomes still, and stillness generates Yin. When stillness reaches its extreme, it moves again. Movement and stillness alternate and are the root of each other… All things are born and transform endlessly." This principle can still be applied to the development of society. These two opposing forces should be complementary. If there is only stillness and no movement, then everything will be solidified and unchanging, and there will be no progress. If new creations do not continue to advance, old experiences will be unable to cope with the environment and unable to maintain survival. Therefore, on the one hand, we must preserve new creations, and on the other hand, when the preserved new creations are insufficient to adapt to newer needs, we must break down old barriers and find new paths.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, we can further analyze the process of social evolution into five stages. (1) The old social system is not enough to maintain people's hearts and is not enough to satisfy the needs of the masses. At this time, everyone feels the pain in their lives caused by the existing social order. (2) A few visionaries and pioneers begin to want to overthrow the old order and yearn for a new ideal. At this time, only thought is advancing, while behavior remains in the old society. (3) The visionaries and pioneers feel that the time is ripe and lead the masses to take action and fight to achieve the new ideal. This transformation is first in politics, second in economics, and third in social customs and habits. In other words, first there is political revolution or reform, followed by industrial revolution, and then reform of social customs and habits. (4) The new ideal is realized, and the new social system is established. This new order is comparatively able to satisfy the needs of the masses, thus stabilizing people's hearts. People's behavior then begins to be regulated by this new system. (5) Human desires will never be satisfied. The satisfaction of needs creates new needs. These new needs cannot be satisfied by the established social system, and coupled with the rigidity and corruption of the original social system, various new dissatisfactions are produced. The evolution of society climbs upwards layer by layer in this way.</p>
<p>Let's cite two examples to illustrate the above five stages of social evolution. By the middle of the fifteenth century, the theocratic politics of Europe were shaken. Theocratic rule made people feel pain. The Black Death and the corruption of the Church gradually made the masses have to find another way out. The Renaissance was to make people return to human life. However, this ideal only succeeded in the form of a narrow-minded humanistic education, and there was no essential change in life. Later, after the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, the Western social order of modern culture emerged. After two world wars, this new order is once again causing people living under it to feel fear and anxiety. European society is now in this stage.</p>
<p>The despotic patriarchal society that maintained Chinese society for more than two thousand years was no longer able to satisfy the people by the end of the Qing Dynasty. Some of them wanted "reform" and "restoration," while others yearned for a new ideal society. Next was the political revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Although the form of the political system has changed and the political ideology system has been established, the living habits of the general public and even political activities still remain within the system of the old feudal society. Chinese society is now in this stage. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words, "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard," are still relevant. The subsequent transformation of Chinese society will have to wait for the political revolution to be completed, so that China reaches a modern and unified state in the experimentation of political systems, followed by economic reform and construction, and then social culture will be transformed, and the new social system will be completed.</p>
<p>Society is evolving, but in which direction is it evolving? I believe that the evolution of society is gradually increasing public welfare. The old social system was able to be established in the first place because, given the intelligence, experience, and existing circumstances of the people at the time, this system was the most able to satisfy common needs. However, the circumstances and experience at the time limited people's vision. Later, when someone recognized the shortcomings of this system, coupled with the emergence of new needs, people rose up to seek a newer system. Why? Because they want to further increase everyone's welfare. When this is achieved, it also means that society has taken a step further. Therefore, in the process of social evolution, only a social order that can better satisfy the needs of the masses and increase public welfare has a greater possibility of success. If there is a force that wants to maintain an unreasonable order and hinder public welfare, then it is a countercurrent. Although it can be sustained for a while, it will eventually fail, because society is always moving forward.</p>
<p>In the current situation of Chinese society, we can see two opposing forces. One is to maintain the original state; the other is to completely change it. Although these two forces are now having opposite effects, unfortunately, they cannot yet be complementary. The movement side is doing its best to destroy the work of the stillness side, while the stillness side is desperately clinging to the existing state of stillness and not allowing it to be destroyed. The existing state of affairs is not adapting to the needs of the masses, and everyone is complaining. This is a fact. Therefore, someone who is working to break the existing state of affairs will be welcomed. However, this creates a misconception that as long as the current situation is broken, it will be considered a success. They do not know that everyone's approval of changing the current situation is not for destruction, but for construction. Everyone hopes that a more reasonable order will appear. Therefore, just destroying is not enough, and maintaining the status quo is also not enough. Society must always move forward. If you don't improve society, someone will come up with ways to improve it. Therefore, we hope that the movement side will recognize the constructive and stabilizing nature of social evolution. On the stillness side, we must also be determined to reform the existing state of affairs and cooperate with the needs of everyone. We hope that these two forces will be opposite yet complementary, so as to promote social development and increase common happiness.</p>
<h3>Transformation (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Lu Shiping has recently acquired two new habits: First, he likes to put his right hand to the bridge of his nose to push up his glasses; second, he loves to say "No can do." These words, dropping from his mouth, are both crisp and resounding, almost carrying a hint of authority. His colleagues can't help but look at him askance—why is Lu Shiping putting on this kind of show? He has always been the most stingy and small-minded among his colleagues, never willing to spend a single penny on friends; but look at his recent demeanor, it is indeed somewhat different: his attitude, his speech, have all changed. Although his clothes and socks are not necessarily more elaborate than before, they seem to be cleaner.</p>
<p>"What's with Old Lu?" colleagues whispered behind his back.</p>
<p>Some believe that he is extremely bored and deliberately pretending to be something he is not, to dispel his feelings of ridicule. In these times, the treatment of public school teachers is so meager, far inferior to that of workers and clerks, and no matter how frugal you are, you cannot make ends meet. His attitude of trying to dispel his feelings of ridicule is not without reason; otherwise, one might indeed starve to death, and one would certainly feel suffocated.</p>
<p>But after careful observation, it can be seen that Lu Shiping's new attitude is definitely not for the sake of dispelling ridicule. No matter what he talks to people about, he always has to say a few "No can do" remarks with emotion, reminding people to look at reality: everyone is selfish, unwilling to work, and sometimes he even cites one or two examples. When speaking, he extends the two fingers of his right hand to the bridge of his nose and pushes his glasses up.</p>
<p>Towards students, his posture is even more imposing, often pushing up his glasses with his head held high, shouting loudly "No can do."</p>
<p>Today, for some unknown reason, he is in a bad mood; after the bell rang for the end of class, several students stood up and asked him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lu, we don't have enough time to write, can we hand in the essay papers after class!"</p>
<p>He said very sternly, "No can do." Pushing up his glasses, he added:</p>
<p>"How can there be any exceptions? Didn't I say that they would be invalid if submitted late?"</p>
<p>"This topic is not easy, there are many possible interpretations."</p>
<p>"Alright, then, I'll make an exception this time."</p>
<p>But many voices immediately rushed over: "You said it yourself, Mr. Lu, papers submitted after the time limit will be invalid."</p>
<p>This is a bit difficult for him, and he pushes up his glasses. However, from the densely packed seats, voices continue to rush over: "In the end, how can we make exceptions, and how can we not be allowed to make exceptions?"</p>
<p>He got angry, his eyeballs bulged out, as if he wanted to bite someone. Usually, even when he is angry, he only frowns and glares at the students. Now, with a psychological backing, his voice is also much louder, and he says loudly:</p>
<p>"Who's making noise? This kind of behavior is not allowed!"</p>
<p>He casually pushed his glasses up, straightened his body, and walked out of the classroom amidst the noise, thinking angrily in his heart: "It's really meaningless to be a poor teacher, not to mention anything else, it's troublesome to be bullied by these little brats. What hope is there for China's future—with students like these naughty ones!"</p>
<p>He became sentimental. Back in the lounge, his colleagues saw his angry face, and someone deliberately provoked him, saying:</p>
<p>"Shiping, why are you angry?"</p>
<p>He first hesitated and denied that he was angry, then shook his head and said that the students were really "no good," and he was pessimistic about the future of Chinese education.</p>
<p>"You are truly far-sighted, thinking so comprehensively!" The colleague said with a smile. "I only feel that life is difficult, and one must solve the problem of living before one has the leisure to think about one's personal future, the future of education, and the future of the country! If one has food but no clothes, how can one have the means to think about these things!"</p>
<p>Several people listening nearby exchanged glances and laughed, hoping to find an explanation for Lu Shiping's new attitude. Of course, everyone knew that Lu Shiping's sudden change to arrogance must have some new development. But why was he so secretive, not revealing any information to others? Being a teacher, getting along with young students, has its own kind of harmonious and joyful meaning, and the interactions between colleagues are also simpler than in other professions. If you meet a few who you can talk to, you can establish pure friendships with each other. But these days, everything is so turbulent and unstable, and the treatment of teachers and civil servants is so unreasonable that life forces everyone to put on a sullen face, and there is no longer any leisurely mood. Those who can find other ways out have gradually turned to other professions, so if Lu Shiping wants to find another career and abandon this teaching job, everyone would not find it strange, but what makes them interested now is why Lu Shiping is so secretive?</p>
<p>Lu Shiping pushed the students' papers onto the corner of his desk in annoyance, shaking his head and humming several "No can do" remarks from his nostrils!</p>
<p>Next to him was the desk of Xu Weixin, the chemistry teacher. Seeing Lu Shiping's attitude, he wanted to make a few jokes to relax everyone's dull mood, but Cheng Junyi walked in the door and said as soon as he stepped in:</p>
<p>"Do you all know what new development Shiping has had?"</p>
<p>Everyone focused their attention at the same time, wanting to know what Lu Shiping was up to, so they were particularly interested in Cheng Junyi's words. Everyone asked him what was going on.</p>
<p>Cheng Junyi had a half-smiling expression, indicating that he was knowledgeable and well-informed. Everyone pressed him to speak, but he insisted on apologizing to Lu Shiping first, asking if Lu Shiping could announce it himself.</p>
<p>Lu Shiping, who was angry, immediately changed to a gentle and cheerful expression. He told Cheng Junyi not to talk nonsense.</p>
<p>"What nonsense?" Junyi said. "Listen everyone, Shiping has written a script and sent it to Mr. Morley. As long as Mr. Morley introduces it, he can choose a famous theater troupe to stage the play. If it sells well, the performance tax will be at least one or two million!"</p>
<p>Everyone congratulated Lu Shiping on his success. Everyone knew that he had some connections with Mr. Morley, who was quite capable in the theater world, and Lu Shiping had always been very fond of theater.</p>
<p>"After all, it's Shiping—I wish you success in advance! If you can simply drop this poor teacher's job, then I will be even happier for you," said Xu Weixin.</p>
<p>"Don't listen to him, this is all Cheng Junyi's unfounded rumors," Lu Shiping defended. "How could I have the ability to write a script, and how could the first script sell well and earn one or two million in taxes?"</p>
<p>"In that case, Junyi must have deliberately spread rumors!"</p>
<p>"I never spread rumors in my life!" Cheng Junyi said firmly.</p>
<p>Several impatient people couldn't stand this roundabout approach, so they simply asked Lu Shiping what new opportunities he had. Everyone was overwhelmed by the pressure of life and was willing to see a colleague escape this difficult life.</p>
<p>However, the old gentleman who taught history by the window did not think so. He could not stand Lu Shiping's arrogant expression—changing jobs is just earning a few more dollars, what is there to be so pretentious and smug about!</p>
<p>Xu Weixin and the others were still joking with Lu Shiping, who only admitted that he was collaborating with a well-known person in the theater world to adapt a script.</p>
<p>"Don't count me in, just because the original work is famous, and the co-author is also quite famous, he can always borrow some light. As long as it can be staged, the box office should be good."</p>
<p>Several listeners envied Lu Shiping greatly. Having such a hobby in one's spare time would be a significant supplement to one's life! Moreover, playing with theater is indeed very interesting.</p>
<p>At this intriguing moment, it was time for everyone to go to class. Each person carried lecture notes or books, resenting that they could not find a side job. The anger that Lu Shiping had just felt towards the students had long subsided. He had originally planned not to let everyone know, and when the play was staged, he would invite all his colleagues to see it, giving them a surprise, letting them know that Lu Shiping also had this skill! But now that Cheng Junyi had revealed it first, that was fine too. He went to teach a class arrogantly, often reaching out to push his glasses, but he no longer put on a sullen face and said "No can do"; although he still said it, his expression was much milder.</p>
<p>Lu Shiping was immersed in fantasy, dreaming of how the audience would be captivated by this play. He looked at his colleagues arrogantly, looked at his students with disgust, and sometimes even glared at them as they came and went.</p>
<p>This attitude lasted for more than two weeks, and then Lu Shiping's attitude suddenly changed again. He became silent, and he often pushed his glasses, but as if he was angry with them, so coldly, with a strong hint of unwillingness.</p>
<p>So, his colleagues whispered privately: What's wrong with Lu Shiping? People can deliberately joke about and expose someone's successful things, but now that kind of unsuccessful expression makes it inconvenient for colleagues to ask him about it, lest they upset him. But everyone said at every opportunity: "What is Shiping up to, why has he changed his mind again?"</p>
<p>After several days passed so boringly, the nosy Cheng Junyi secretly reported to everyone again, this time not in front of Lu Shiping.</p>
<p>"Shiping's script is a bust—there is no way to stage it recently," he said.</p>
<p>As if confirming an interesting piece of news, everyone was disappointed for Lu Shiping, and also breathed a sigh of relief for Lu Shiping. It turned out that he was silent and unhappy because he could not stage the play. That history professor was almost gloating—he thought it was better that there was no way to stage it, otherwise, Lu Shiping's arrogant expression would not know how high it would rise!</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>Junyi shook his head, closing his eyes for three to five seconds, indicating that this matter was very difficult to explain.</p>
<p>"I messed up last time, Shiping did not ask Mr. Morley to criticize and introduce it. He and the co-author asked someone else to introduce it, so Mr. Morley was a little unhappy, and this plan is difficult to succeed," Junyi said, and then expressed his regret for Shiping, saying that if it was put on hold like this, it was uncertain when there would be another opportunity.</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you ask Mr. Morley to introduce it?"</p>
<p>"That was probably the co-author's idea," Junyi said. "It turns out that there are factions in everything in the world. I hate this kind of thing the most. It's meaningless!"</p>
<p>Just as he was saying this, Lu Shiping came in. Everyone pretended that they had not talked about this matter.</p>
<p>After Lu Shiping greeted them, he secretly sized them up a few times, somewhat suspecting that they were talking about him, but he could not see anything, so he sat silently at his desk, not saying a word or laughing with others.</p>

<p>Liao Dong responded and left. At this time, he felt very confused in his heart!</p>
<p>He also felt that the scene he had just witnessed was very tragic, but he felt even more terrified! Today, he saw Xiao Hong clearly for the first time, and this first impression was such a bloody, tearful, and fragmented impression! He was almost afraid to look at her again! If their relationship was not linked together, perhaps his feelings would be much better than now, at least he would sympathize with her and help her like Baoling. But as soon as their relationship was linked together, she was his future wife; he would live with her permanently; this made him worry! He had already conceived the idea of leaving this family in the future, but thinking that he would be restrained by this future wife, he was not only worried, but also resentful! Because of these complex feelings, he was troubled! He could not bring himself to approach Xiao Hong happily, so he went to the store to weigh two taels of rice ginseng, and took "Yunnan Baiyao," asking Master Li to send it to Boss Liao.</p>
<p>The proprietress was unhappy seeing Boss Liao so concerned about Xiao Hong, and she could not say anything with her eyes covered. She perfunctorily helped Baoling carry Xiao Hong to the bed in the room. Taking the opportunity, she vented her anger on Baoling, saying:</p>
<p>"Alright, you can go to the store now. It's all because you helped her in the kitchen that you helped cause this disaster!"</p>
<p>Baoling, hindered by the fact that Boss Liao was present, did not speak. She silently cursed,</p>
<p>"Heartless shrew! Executioner!"</p>
<p>Boss Liao first applied "Yunnan Baiyao" to Xiao Hong's two feet, which were covered in blood, and then wrapped them in cloth for her. Then he asked the proprietress to boil some ginseng soup and fed her a bowl, and only felt relieved after seeing Xiao Hong calm down a little.</p>
<p>After a few days, Xiao Hong's injuries were still serious, festering, and she remained unconscious. It was thanks to Boss Liao going to ask a doctor to treat her, and constantly letting her drink some ginseng soup to invigorate her and replenish her blood. According to the doctor, Xiao Hong's feet would definitely not be healed in a short period of time, and she would be disabled even after they were healed.</p>
<p>The proprietress was completely frustrated! She thought: It's only been a month or two since she married into the family, and such a big mess has happened. The medical expenses will cost a lot, which is really a loss. If she is disabled in the future, she will not only be unable to help herself, but she will also have to support her for the rest of her life, wouldn't it be a waste of my efforts? She did not dare to complain to Boss Liao about these things, because she had caused them herself. The boss was still complaining about herself. Moreover, this misfortune was also caused by herself. (Naturally, she dared not tell Boss Liao about this.)</p>

<h3>Last Night's Moon</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Last night's moon was truly beautiful, like a silver-white plate, hanging high in the center of the blue sky. I opened the window and let a piece of clear brilliance shine in, so I stood quietly by the window, thinking of a friend far away.</p>
<p>It seemed to be such a beautiful moonlit night, that friend, had stared at me with a pair of calm eyes, told me:</p>
<p>"You are building jade towers in the moon palace, you are salvaging pearls in the clouds."</p>
<p>Not understanding her meaning, I stared blankly at her, she smiled, stretched out a slender white hand, pointed to the bright moon and white clouds in the sky, and asked me softly:</p>
<p>"Do you love these?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" I replied quietly.</p>
<p>"But do you know that this is wind, this is shadow, this is illusion, this is ethereal, this is not life!"</p>
<p>I understood a little, and immediately lowered my head. For a long time, I told her painfully:</p>
<p>"I know, but I love these!"</p>
<p>She smiled again and patted my shoulder:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if you love them, what matters is: don't be serious!"</p>
<p>After saying this, she left, to a distant place.</p>
<p>Since then, whenever a beautiful moonlit night comes, I will always think of that friend, and I will always feel confused and lost.</p>
<h3>Paradise Lost</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>——Occasionally, on a night street, I stumbled upon a small Western-style envelope covered in mud in the corner of the sidewalk. Perhaps it was trampled by people's shoes! However, I could still faintly recognize that there were no words on the envelope. Opening it, there were two sheets of paper filled with messy strokes, and in the lower left corner was the bright red name of the organization. The owner of this letter, judging from the handwriting, seemed to be a woman, but also seemed to be a man. The age seemed to be very young, and the letter was full of young people's feelings. There was no signature, nor was there a recipient. After reading it from beginning to end, it added to the burden in my heart. I thought, it would be better to make it public and return it to the writer and the recipient. Some places inside were also vague, and I could only make up for them based on speculation.</p>
<p>Why haven't you written for several days? I hope to see more information, just like searching for a source in the desert wilderness. But, I am also afraid of reading the letters, because I don't know if you are intentional or unintentional, you always like to prick my soul, yes, my soul. I still have it, and I think that is not very good.</p>
<p>The situation of life is always bad, and the thoughts in my mind have become more divergent these days.</p>
<p>Going to the office is really annoying. Signing in, sitting, talking and laughing, budgeting, submitting reports...stirring it up, it's simply playing with life. A boring day passed by day by day, and I couldn't think of a reason for myself. I write a diary at night, and I stare at the book blankly for a long time. As a result, I still go out to the street and squeeze into a large circle in the crowd.</p>
<p>My director is really not good, he is the young guy in a suit, but he has a big head. It is said that he is the nephew of X, who squints his eyes when he talks and smiles. When I tell him some good ideas, he always pushes and delays. It's so annoying. Fortunately, there is nothing to do, so I just read the newspaper in the office. A newspaper can now be read for four or five hours. Look at how good a skill this is.</p>
<p>I have no interest in reading at all, and I have sent all my old books away. These things are a waste to read. Lying on my desk looking at the office, it's okay not to use these things. My family doesn't have people who steal national disasters and victories like bandits. I can go to foreign countries to gild myself. I knew this a long time ago, and I would not have suffered so much for nothing.</p>
<p>Are crows all black under the sky? K.S.P. also always tells me about these receipts, reimbursements, and false accounts in letters. …Alas, a mess, a mess. Can these things ultimately be done? Can’t they be done? In the current disordered environment, it simply fills people with doubt and hesitation. Coercion, enticement, no human sympathy, no interest in life, external attacks plus internal weakness, I myself doubt how long I can respect myself. A dirty environment is of course an ugly model. Can't I escape the norms of this model? Sadness comes from my heart, but I can't deceive myself.</p>
<p>Tell me, will you also stare blankly at the bright moon? Tell me, will you also shower in the roar of the storm?</p>
<p>Memories cannot quench the thirst in my heart, and the future is even darker. All that exists is a faint fluorescent light, but even with hard work, it cannot illuminate the trajectory of the road. –Are you also like this, why can't our lives break free from this rut?</p>
<p>Write back to me quickly, it's terribly lonely around here. How much will a person who has lost happiness cherish the distant friendship?</p>
