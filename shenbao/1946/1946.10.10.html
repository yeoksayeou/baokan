<h3>打開目前僵局途徑　政府仍主和平協商　蔣主席國慶日昭告同胞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕蔣主席今日下午八時在中央廣播電台，爲三十五年國慶紀念，對全國同胞廣播，原詞如下：</p>
<p>全國同胞們：</p>
<p>今天是我們中華民國第三十五週年國慶紀念日，也是抗戰結束，政府還都之後，第一次舉行的國慶紀念，回溯　國父與革命先烈，締造民國的艱難，追念抗戰軍民犧牲奮鬥的史績，瞻望統一和平建設的前途，省察國家獨立民族自由難得而易失的時機，凡我同胞，更當勤奮鼓勵，繼續邁進，實行國父遺敎，完成先烈的志業，建設三民主義的現代國家，達成中華民國富强康樂的目的。</p>
<p>國父有言：「建屋不能將就，建國亦然，當有極堅毅的精神，而以極忍耐之力量行之」。我國自辛亥革命以來，到今天已滿三十五年了，我們國民革命的事業，在此三十五年之間，前後相比，實際是在邁步前進之中，然而國民革命最後成功的距離，自然還是很遼遠，自從國民政府奠都南京，完成北伐，乃至八年抗戰的結果，我們已經擊敗了日本侵略的强權，洗雪了五十年來的國恥，恢復了台灣的領土，接收了東北的主權，我們並且已經取消了百年來重重束縛的不平等條約，建立了與世界各國友好合作的基礎，這都是國民革命顯著的成就，實足以吿慰於</p>
<p>國父與革命先烈在天之靈，我們國民政府所以能集中全國同胞的意志，結合全國同胞的力量，突破險阻艱危重疊而至的國難，克服外患內憂相交侵逼的危局，以獲得抗戰的最後勝利，這就足證明國民政府革命建國的方針，符合於全國同胞的願望，我們今天撿討過去的成績，惟有繼續奮勉，共同一致，維護國家民族的獨立自由，尤其要始終一貫，實現　國父三民主義的遺敎，使我們中國成爲獨立統一强盛民主的國家，作遠東和平的支柱，國父說：「中華民國之創造者，其目的在和平」，我們今日紀念辛亥革命，必須三復斯言。</p>
<p>我在去年今日，曾經說明今後工作，是「建國第一」在今年元旦，又曾爲我同胞剴切說明，國家統一與政治民主的必要，不幸這十個月以來的經過，一切不能依照預期而實現，迄今變亂擾攘，靡有止息，我全國同胞，間接的都受着國家不能和平，社會不能安定，生活沒有保障的痛苦，這實在是無限的痛心，我們國家的基礎，究應如何使之穩定，目前非常的變態，究應如何納入正軌，我要乘此機會，披肝瀝胆，詳吿我全國同胞。</p>
<h3>建國的基本條件在軍令政令統一</h3>
<p>我們國民革命的目的，是在實行三民主義建立平等獨立自由的中華民國，而建國的基本條件，是國家的統一與社會的安定，社會秩序如果不能安定，則人民生命財產，不能獲得保障，農工生產自然無由發達，而人民生活水準，更無從提高，同時國家統一，如果不能鞏固，則內亂必至頻仍，民主基礎，自然無法建立，而建國事業，亦無從着手，所以政府當前對時局的方針，是以保障國家的統一爲第一，並循和平的途徑，以求統一，我們知道，國家統一的最低條件，乃是軍令與政令的統一，欲求軍令的統一，必須實行軍隊國家化，建立全國性的軍隊，欲求政令的統一，必須國家的法令制度能够推行於全國，袪除地方的割據，如果一國之內，有兩個對立的軍隊，地方的政治形成割據的局勢，那就不能稱爲統一的國家。所以我們今日要爭取和平，必須鞏固國家的統一，可以說今日中國沒有統一，就沒有和平，而統一乃是和平的唯一條件，這一條件，如被否認，或遭破壞，不但延長人民的痛苦，且將引致國家的危亡，這是每一個人民切身利害生死的關鍵，也就是政府無可旁貸的責任，政府對於阻碍統一，企圖分裂的叛變，自不能熟視無覩，而全國同胞，對於危害國脈斷喪民命的禍亂，更不能袖手旁觀，置國家民族於萬刦不復之地。</p>
<p>政府求取團結不惜委曲忍讓</p>
<p>但是政府對於今日國內的政治問題，仍是堅持以政治方法求得解決的方針，這一個方針，是始終不會變更，因爲我們抗戰勝利的成果，決不忍自己手裏來毀棄，戰後人民的痛苦，不能再使之日益加深，和平建國的機會，萬不能遭受挫阻，而聽其蹉跎貽誤，所以政府這一年來，竭盡心力，不惜任何委曲忍讓，總以求得全國團結一致，避免衝突，共謀國是爲目標，政治協商會議的召集，主旨就在於此，最近政府所迭次表示的聲明，其重點亦在於此，無論國內的變亂糾紛如何劇烈，只要有和平解決一綫的希望，政府決不放棄和平的途徑，而今日達到國家統一的和平途徑，就是要軍隊國家化，政治民主化。如何實現政治民主化，就是要召開國民大會，與擴大政府組織，使政府得償還政於民之願，而國民能有行使政權之宜，如何實現軍隊國家化，就是要依照整軍及統編旣定的方案，劃分軍區，規定日程，限期實行，使任何黨派，以後不得再以武力作政爭，必須如此而後，我們中國，始能成爲眞正統一的民主國家。</p>
<p>要求各黨各派參加國民大會</p>
<p>今日政府所要求於各黨派者，就是參加國民政府，出席國民大會，所要求共產黨的，祇是放棄其以武力割據地盤，分裂國家的企圖，與各黨派一致來參加國民大會，這一步驟的實現，乃是各黨派共同協議的成案，也是全國同胞一致的要求，所望各黨派如期提出國府委員及國民大會代表的名單，使國民政府得及早改組，國民大會得以如期完成。</p>
<p>現在特別要爲我同胞說明的，就是關於停止軍事衝突的問題，這本是我們政府一貫的宗旨，而且政府所期望的，是全面的永久的停止衝突，六月間的軍事三人會議，其主旨本在協議恢復交通，　　定軍隊陣地等問題，以　實現停止衝突的保證，終因共產黨堅執成見，而陷於停頓，我個人爲求得永久和平，在過去三個月內，曾經提出若干建議，希望共產黨予以接受，亦均被他們所拒絕，後來他們又要求立刻召開由馬歇爾將軍所主持的軍事三人小組會議，但是由於已往事實的經騐，如果對於若干主要的基本問題，不先求得協議與諒解，則三人會議的重開，勢必於事無補，因之我堅決贊成以司徒大使爲中心的五人會議先行召集，使政府與中共對於組織國府委員會的問題，能够成立協議，以顯示共同遵守政協決議的誠意，並以此爲獲得實施政協決議的基點，在此項誠意與基點樹立以後，乃可以取得新的互信與互助，我並主張，在宣佈停止衝突的同時，中共應提出其參加十一月十二日召開的國民大會代表名單，以表示其對政府合作的誠意，如果當時能够照此進行，我相信停止衝突，必早已實現了。</p>
<h3>主席廣播灌成音片</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕國慶前夕蔣主席在黃埔路官邸辦公室向全國同胞廣播，事先由廣播電台裝置灌音設備，主席廣播時，狀甚偷快，音片灌成，主席試聽一過，甚表滿意。</p>
<h3>同時召開三五會　俾軍政獲得協議</h3>
<p>現在共產黨對於政府在十月二日所提出關於改組國民政府與實施整軍方案的兩點辦法，旣不接受，對於馬歇爾將軍與司徒大使所提休戰的建議，亦表示拒絕，但是政府並不因此而放棄和平解決的方針，政府仍舊希望用調解與商談的辦法，來求得解決，我們國內當前政治與軍事情形，斷不能任其繼續發展，使人民的痛苦加深，又鑒於目前形勢的緊張，以及一般因不明瞭政府政策，而引起的不安，我今天特在國慶紀念日，鄭重聲明，就是打開目前僵局的途徑，還是要用和平商談的方式，將幾個基本問題，求得解決，一俟下列問題，達到協議，政府準備即下停止衝突的命令，我主張五人會議與三人會議，應同時召開，第一，以五人小組會議協議改組國民政府，第二，以三人小組會議解決實施整軍統編方案有關的問題，一俟獲得協議，只要共產黨能够停止他軍事行動，不再攻擊國軍，則政府立即發布停止衝突的命令。以上是政府處理目前局勢的方針，爲國家前途着想，爲人民利益着想，惟此爲達到和平統一切實可行的途徑。總之政府對於共產黨在任何情勢之下，始終不放棄開誠商談的期待，祇要共產黨同以國脈民命爲重，袪除成見，瞭解政府的苦衷，實現上述的辦法，那麽不但停止衝突，可以立即實現，而且和平建國的工作，也可以毫無障礙的順利達成。</p>
<p>同胞們，我們過去八年抗戰，賴我全國同胞，一致的團結，與堅忍的奮鬥，乃能貫澈始終，獲得最後的勝利，今後建國大業，仍須我全國同胞，秉持堅定的信心，遵循確定的步驟，踐履篤實，百折不回，促進五權憲法的實施，保障三民主義的完成，尤須齊一心志，共負責任，鞏固國家的統一，安定社會的秩序，以樹立和平的基礎，完成建國的大業，纔能貫澈國父的遺志，而無媿於革命先烈與抗戰犧牲軍民的英靈。（完）</p>
<h3>彭部長談話</h3>
<p>政府仍盼繼續談判</p>
<p>中共用意殊難紫解</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕外記者招待會。九日下午三時半舉行，由彭部長學沛主持，茲誌彭部長答覆各記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，聞中共已拒絕十日休戰之建議，政府態度如何？</p>
<p>答，政府立塲已見宋院長談話，中共用意何在，殊難索解，旣拒絕改組國民政府之談判，又拒絕解決軍事問題，以永杜衝突之商議，現又拒絕休戰十日之建設，凡此皆中共所不斷要求，及至政府接受，則中此反加拒絕，論者謂其採取阻碍政策，衷心實不願解決問題以助成統一之局面，跡其行事，令人不能無疑，政府之方針如宋院長所宣示，仍盼談判繼續，以求和平之解決。</p>
<p>問，國軍距張家口多少里？</p>
<p>答，國軍於八日進入　北，距張家口約有八十華里。</p>
<p>問，政府仍決於十一月十二日召開國民大會，並改組政府否？</p>
<p>答，政府已決定於十一月十二日召開國民大會，因延期已數次，倘再延期，恐受國民　難，以致懷疑政府實施憲政之決心，至改組政府，則因中共之拒絕談判而受阻礙。</p>
<p>問，蘇北及東北軍事情形如何？</p>
<p>答，蘇北國軍已進人高　。寳應。東北方面共軍爲策應關內北軍有所舉動，但無足重視。位於多倫，承德間之共軍根據地同塲，已入國軍之手。山東已收復　縣·棗莊·棗莊爲煤礦中心，唯機器已被拆去，深堪痛惜，此種舉動徒苦礦區人民，並使京滬各大都市工業遭受打擊而已。</p>
<h3>馬使昨一度來滬　訪周恩來談話內容不詳　民盟梁漱溟又提折衷案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕美使館新聞專員康納士九日宣布，馬歇爾特使九日上午九時專機飛滬，與周恩來將軍會談，已於當日下午六時返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕馬特使九日赴滬，係專爲邀請周恩來返京，參與和談，頃悉，周恩來已拒絕返京，政府正硏究次一步辦法中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕和平談判已成不絕如縷之勢，馬特使九日曾親赴滬一行，調人之努力與苦心，於此可見。九日晨九時，民盟梁漱溟曾訪司使作長談，梁旋赴參政會訪雷震，辭出後再赴外部訪王世杰。據聞，梁曾提出一折衷辦法，期雙方均可接受，惟其內容各方均保守秘密。據梁稱：此爲三人，五人以外之一新途徑，唯目前尙未至發表時期。又兪大維上午十一時廿分曾訪司使，談一小時，傅涇波則於十一時半訪宋院長，下午六時半宋院長往訪司使，談一小時後，再赴馬特使行館，下午九時辭出。由各方接見情形以觀，或將即有發展亦未可知，傳聞司使將於十日發表一文件，內容則未獲悉。記者頃詢中共對宋院長聲明所作態度，據稱：中共意見約有兩點，（一）中共過去同意，參加非正式五人會議，是要保證在商討改組政府認爲有結果後即行停戰。但美方與政府均未得此保證。故此令政府拒絕保證，非共產黨拒絕參加。五人會議共黨確認一面內戰，一面談改組政府，實爲不可能之事。（二）三人，五人會同開之建議，未接到通知，故無復致答，並非拒絕。共產黨發言人認爲，朱院長聲明兩點，無事實根據。又發言人對馬司八日聲明，再度表示希望調人有公正方案，使政府與共產黨雙方均能接受，則和平前途自有重大發展。</p>
<h3>周恩來招待記者指責馬司之聲明</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本埠九日訊〕周恩來今夜在此間招待報界，指責馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使昨日之聲明，某數點與事實不符，並披露渠已向蔣主席提出十一點建議，俾實現一月與二月間在渝商妥之協定。或請證實馬使今日飛滬，勸渠赴京重開和談，已遭謝絕，致馬使獨自返京之說，周氏答稱：「無可置評」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共發言人陳家康對馬司聯合聲明發表談話如下：（一）昨（八日）馬司聯合聲明發表之前，並未通知中共，甚至在當日下午四時，即該項聲明發表之後，中共代表董必武被邀與馬司會晤時，馬司兩氏亦未以發表聲明之事見吿。至於由王炳南口頭傳達之中共答覆三點，在發表時更未送經校正。（二）馬司兩氏在十月六日交由王炳南轉達之建議原文，肯定說明停攻張家口十天是有條件的，此即以實行（To　Carry　Out）蔣委員長十月二日兩次要求爲目的，因此馬司聯合聲明避免將該項建議原文發表。（三）馬司聯合聲明證實緩攻張家口十天之辦法，出於馬司建議，此不帝爲政府設緩兵之計，逼中共作城下之盟。</p>
<p>昨盛傳周恩來氏有赴京準備，但上海周公館方面稱並無所知。</p>
<h3>國大聯誼會宣言</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕國民大會聯誼會發表對國是宣言，主張：國大應如期召開，各黨各派應參加國大。</p>

<h3>克利浦斯夫人小史</h3>
<p>「渺渺途程遠</p>
<p>難阻有意請</p>
<p>斯民凡憶兆</p>
<p>期待張臂迎」</p>
<p>—駐英鄭大使贈詩</p>
<p>克里涌斯夫人到中國來了。她是英國援華聯合會的會長。這一個團體，集合着許許多多對中國尊敬同情的熱心人士，在夫人的領導之下，給了戰時受難的中國人民以多少溫暖的友情，多少物質與精神的鼓勵。</p>
<p>夫人的丈夫克里浦斯爵士，是英國工黨中的紅人，著名的印度，「克里浦斯方案」的起草者。一九四〇年，那時工黨尙未當政，他以議員的身分，訪問過中國，在重慶發表了幾决演講。回國以後，他把長期戰爭中中國人民的苦難，以自己的親見親聞寫了下來。這些紀事，使克里浦斯夫人讀了大爲感動，引起了她對中國人民深切的了解和關懷。</p>
<p>那時，英國許多對中國同情的民間團體，正很想聯合起來，集中力量，作一些有益於中國人民的工作。一九四二年六月，援華聯合會終於在這樣的要求之下組織成立了，克里浦斯夫人就是爲這個組織奔走最力的人，在一致的推選之下，她出任了援華聯合會的會長。她在無一綫電中作廣播呼籲，要大家節衣縮食，捐款緩助中國的人民；同時，她並致書各國會議員，各人民團體，請他們一致協助，來推動這個工作。工黨更特別帮忙，聯絡了各工會和工業合作團體，支持她這個事業的進行。</p>
<p>由於如此普遍的響應，援華會在那年雙十節前就募到了一筆爲數不小的款子，匯給了蔣夫人，這主要地是爲救濟中國的難童和傷兵用的。以後，募捐一點是繼續着到目前止，陸續匯到中國的款子已達英金一百八十多萬鎊了。援　會所收到的捐款，近自英國各地，遠自番港南洋，在那些捐款者的信中，充份流露着對中國無限的欽崇和同情，倫敦援華總會的辦公室中，就保存着不少這樣的信件。</p>
<p>因爲克里沛斯夫人主持援華聯合會的豐功偉績，今年元旦，英王還特別贈與了她一顆GBE勛章，這是英國政府贈與對國家有功續的　女的　高勵章。夫人雖然一向是一個熱烈的中國愛好者，而且她也時常喜歡和朋友們談到東方，但她自己却只到過蘇聯，從沒有到過中國。這回還是她第一次到　自己所時常想念的國家來，不知我們所能給她的，會是歡喜還是失望？</p>
<p>這次和克夫人一同來的還有密勒夫人，她也是援　聯合會的創辦人之一，一位知名的社會工作者，現在，她是援華聯合會的秘書。她主持　授華會幾年來大部分的行政工作，也是克夫人最主要的助手。</p>

<h3>暹華鋼軌改運南國　沒保證由南償還　並允不將鐵路附件他還</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日合衆電〕中國駐美大使館通事陳之邁稱：國務院官員曾對中國大使館保證，凡聯總規定運華之鋼軌而經轉遝南斯拉夫者，將全以南斯拉夫所定之鋼軌償還。陳參事謂：將巾饑鋼軌轉運他國，當然影響我國經濟復員工作，但渠亦謂鋼軌尙不及舖軌時所需之螺針螺套長釘等附件之重要，且國務院亦曾允許凡此不易獲得之物件，均不他運，因無此類附件，即不能利用鋼軌也。渠希望美政府立即收回停止此類物品運華之命令，因中國交通部長近曾通知中爾大使館官員，目前已有能存放鋼軌之棧房多處，且已有大量之鋼軌存放上海，俟舖軌附件運到，以便應用。並稱：「吾人之假定，即恢復運輸乃解決中國復原問題之關鍵、國務院曾對吾人保證中國在此方面、將不致受損失，則目前已屬車新考慮禁運令之時機矣。」</p>

<h3>強顏爲歡祝國慶</h3>
<p>勝利已整整一年多，而今年勝利以後第二度的國慶日，誠不料吾人還在沈鬱的氣氛中消磨過去，每一個人，看見了滿街滿市靑天白日滿地紅的國旗，表面上在歡笑，暗底裏却在歎息！從前也許沒了解「强顏爲歡」的滋味，可是在今天來祝國慶，我們都帶着沉重的心情。我們聽到戰塲上的殺伐聲還是不息，本來盼望可以勉强有一紙張家口停戰的命令，有和平談判重開的安慰消息，點綴着這雙十節的國慶，而今都變成夢幻！儘管蔣主席作語重心長的廣播訓示，政府要人有仍望繼續談判的明朗宣吿，然而中共翻雲覆雨，依然不肯參加和談，畢竟使得國人不能度一個和平的國慶。我們今天祗能强顏爲歡，實在是拜受中共之賜！</p>
<p>去年的國慶日，方距勝利未久，上海市三四百萬的市民，盡情慶祝，熱烈異常，真所謂萬人空巷，如醉如在。曾幾何時，一年容易，感慨萬千！去年的歡顏，到今年大槪都變成愁容了吧！雖不全是愁眉苦臉，至少都感覺得黯淡無光！我們苦戰八年，終於獲勝，本來是有光采的，而且應該光芒萬丈；然而這應有的光芒，都給好亂之徒用「解放」「鬬爭」的烽火燒得烏黑了。</p>
<p>本來，和平是中國戰後建國的唯一出路，而達到和平的方法，也只有靠政府與中共雙方推心置腹，互相掬示誠意，纔能有望。和談，和談，談了一年而依然得不到和，究其癥結，就是缺乏這個「誠」字；縱不是雙方不誠，至少有一方並無誠意。「不誠無物」，還能望有什麼結果！可是今天中共却不責自己的不誠，反怪調人的偏袒，天下事之奇突，無過於此。其實中國之事，與美國有什麼相干？而美國朋友之所以如此抱了熱忱來作魯仲連，無非希望有一個和平的世界，人類不再打第三次大戰。但就中共的作風看來，好似硬要在中國造出一個分裂局面來，好準備在未來的三次大戰中提供這塊大陸作戰塲一般。我們在中共存心扮演這類戲劇的舞臺上，逢着我們多災多難的國慶，叫我們怎好眞心地笑得出來？</p>
<p>國慶是一個喜慶日子。「人逢喜氣精神爽」，偏偏今年我們逢到國慶，只有意興闌珊，而未必能破涕爲笑。政府雖允停戰十天，而中共依然拒絕和談，究竟爲的什麽？據合衆社南京電稱，人們現信中共實圖促成英美蘇三國共同調停之局，而尤注重蘇聯。果如此說，那末，中共之所以屢變其要求，甚至要求旣遂而更提一新要求，却始終不願參加和談者，無非要表示不信任馬帥，逼馬帥返國，而如其願望以蘇聯代美國而已。這種自己毫無誠意而希望調人換班的辦法，也不過是中共企圖分裂中國的工作過程中一種延宕的手法，並不値得我們大驚小怪。</p>
<p>不過講到調解，能否有成，還是要靠雙方當事人是否具有誠意的根苗，與調人無關。調人最大之能事，亦祇有盡力啓發雙方潛在的誠意而已。若當事人的雙方或一方根本沒有什麼和解的誠意，那就換一百個調人也無濟於事。相傳陸隴其作作平湖知縣，有兄弟二人爭產涉訟。陸升堂，置訟事不問，先指弟而詢其兄，「伊爲汝何人？」兄曰，「是否弟也。」陸曰，「汝試喚之！」兄遵命喚一聲「兄弟。」陸又依式囑咐乃弟，弟亦遵命喚「哥哥。」陸佯若無事，但囑依式再喚。爭訟之兄弟，如此呼喚者十數聲，突相抱痛哭，同聲申請，願相讓產罷訟。陸乃善言勸勉，結案退堂。一塲官司，就此了結。這兩兄弟，初蔽於一念之私，爭而入訟，一旦發見天良，抱頭痛哭，戾氣化爲祥和。從可知爭執的雙方，如果調解無成，千萬不必責怪調人，應該首先痛自艾悔，掘發自己的良知。</p>
<p>外間雖傳馬帥或將返國，但馬司兩使則稱如有餘地，仍將盡力，這種知其不可爲而爲之的精神，眞足感佩。我們相信他們兩位和平老人可有做陸隴其的資格，並且我們以爲千千萬萬中國的老百姓也均有做陸隴其的資格，正不必再煩調人換班。但不知中共在政府喚了他幾聲「兄弟」而後，是否願意回叫幾聲「哥哥，」而一旦也能抱頭痛哭，釋兵修好，使我們度此沉鬱憂惶的國慶以後，居然獲得天外飛來的喜訊？我們盼望平湖縣大堂上陸隴其的奇跡，畢竟能在此時此地出現於中國的政治舞臺上。</p>

<h3>常熟日憲兵隊長—大肆殘殺罪證確　虞山下掘出白骨纍纍夕陽荒草尋覓忠骸　軍事法庭告慰忠魂</h3>
<p>— 本報記者袁文中</p>
<p>〔本報特稿〕民國三十二年七月九日，江蘇省內魚米之鄕的太倉，在日寇鐵蹄之下這到一次空前大劫。一批殺人魔王，常熟日憲兵隊和太　日憲兵隊派了大隊人馬，在太倉境內以「莫須有」的罪名，捉去了愛國志士與無辜良民達五十餘人之多。</p>
<p>忠魂錄二十二人</p>
<p>這五十餘人都被解到常熟日憲兵隊裏拘押，受盡一切虐待，拷打，和刑逼，直到該年十二月，經僞太倉縣長唐劍勳向憲兵隊長米村春喜一再請求，才把其中卅幾人放了出來，餘下二十二人，他們的姓名是吳雨蒼，胡家棟，兪子範，聞星五，葉振西，汪學良，陸嘯雲，沈鴻義，王兆頤，楊雲天，徐仁達，許榮讓，胡正淸，金仲山，鄭漱石，黃寳良，錢新一，戴家祥，金荐揚，魏光照陳天良，顧息兮，可憐從此在這世界上就再也見不到他們的踪跡，聽不到他們的消息，無疑的，他們早已被那些惡魔活生生地害死了。然而，最慘絕人寰的是惡魔還毀屍滅跡，連骨灰也不肯留給家屬，偶然有家屬前往探問消息，總是含糊答復，不是說解到南京上海去了，就是說生病送進醫院去了，可憐他們在魔爪之下，祇有含寃飲泣，而直到現在，他們親人的屍骨，還不知丟　在何處。</p>
<p>不吐實實地調查</p>
<p>勝利了，無惡不作的常熟日憲兵隊米村春喜終於被當局逮捕由第一綏靖區軍事法庭審判。但是經過幾次偵訊的結果，狡猾的米村除了承認將汪學良以下十七人送至上海日本十三軍軍法處處死外，對於吳雨蒼，胡家棟，兪子範，聞星五，葉振西等五人，則一口咬定是病死在當時縣立醫院中。</p>
<p>究竟這五人有沒有送進縣立醫院？如果送進去的他們的病况怎樣？治療經過如何？如經治愈他們是如何出院的？如不治身故則屍體何在？這幾點都是重要的關鍵，而爲判罪時所必須的根據，因此，軍事法庭特派該庭主任書記官李業，親到常熟去作一番實地調査。</p>
<p>李氏在上星期四曾至蘇州，因公路浸水，中途折回，改於前日再去，記者聞悉後，即徵得李氏同意，與他同車前往。</p>
<p>「凱旋號」一早把我們帶到蘇州，轉搭小汽車，在十時左右抵達常熟。這是一個寗靜平淡的城市，小橋流水，粉牆黑瓦，還保留着一些古老的風味，而當地的有閒階級也還是以「」茶館聽說書來消磨生活。</p>
<p>找綫索輾轉探問</p>
<p>下車以後，我們立刻就去拜訪縣長，縣政府的所在地就是從前敲憲兵隊的隊址，不巧得很，一踏進大門，就看見「縣長公出」的一塊牌子，原來縣長到陽澄湖去了，由一位葉秘書接見，李主任把公文送交，並表達來意以後，葉秘書因爲他本人是廣東人，且蒞任不久，對於當地情形不很熟悉，就轉請了一位縣府裏督學高才佐來做我們的嚮導。</p>
<p>高督學眞是一位典型的誠懇熱心的君子，他陪着我們奔波終日，追尋綫索，如果沒有他的幫助，我們的工作眞不知要困難多少。我們主要的是調査敵僞時期的縣立醫院，但這醫院早已解散了。唯一的綫索就是現在的公立醫院。</p>
<p>公立醫院院長兪季湜醫師，人很瘦小，近視眼已到很深的程度。他對於我們的來意非常贊同，但表示愛莫能助，他在淪陷時期自己懸牌做醫師，所以不淸楚縣立醫院的情形。他說，縣立醫院最後兩任院長是張俠和金紹周，前者現不知去向，後者因盜賣醫院公產，勝利後曾一度被拘，但後來不知如何活動釋出，現在也不知隱匿何處。當時米村在常熟的暴行，確是擢髮難數，殺起人來常在午夜，綁到北門外荒郊去，或用刺刀戳死，或在身上塗以牛肉，讓狼狗噬斃，因此屍骨亦無從找起。我們在失望之下，還是堅持請他協助，問他在本地有沒有當時曾在縣立醫院裏做過的醫生護士。或者管理員茶房之流，可以讓我們去訪問？他閉起眼　來想了一想，終於告訴我們一個人和　的地址，那就是以前張俠院長的妻子，產科醫生葉　貞。</p>
<p>書記官一個插曲</p>
<p>從公立醫院出來，當地記者居然得到了消息，趕着前來採訪，我爲了工作的便利，一直保持軍事法庭書記官的身份，他們也問我要新聞，可以說是「記者採訪記者」，也是此行中的一個有趣插曲。</p>
<p>曲曲折折的轉彎抹角，終於尋到了保本街五號，產科醫生的牌子掛出在外面，我們推門進去，裏面一位白髮老太太，一位中年婦人，看到我們三個不速之客，她們相當地驚疑，我們問：「葉醫生在不在？」說是在生病，但後來終於從內室出來了。她面色的確很蒼白，年紀大約三十多歲，梳兩根小辮子。我們表明了來意，一再的解釋找她決不會對她有所不利，我們目的在調査米村的罪惡，我們祗要知道：當時有沒有呉雨蒼等五人送進醫院，送進去以後結果又是怎樣？葉醫生和她的家屬，對於我們似乎多少帶些戒備的心理，雖然她說很明瞭這種情形，知道對她決無關係，但是她說張俠院長在三十一年年底就難開縣立醫院，移交與最後一任金紹周院長，她本人也在三十二年初　職，所以對於以後發生的事情，當然無從知道，最後她另外介紹我們去找一位龐濟雲女醫師，據說她是一直工作到醫院解散爲止的。</p>
<p>我們雖然遭到兩度失望，但祇要另有綫索，還是鼓起精神，再求發展。走近縣東街，遠遠就看到一家　貨店門口懸掛的「龐濟雲」醫生的招牌，店堂裏夫婦兩人正在吃飯，我們問龐醫生在不在？女的就站起來招呼我們進裏面一間醫室去，原來她就是龐醫生。她的態度似乎很誠懇，但是也無法確定是不是有吳雨蒼等這麼五個人送進醫院，她說那時候醫院裏面送進送出的病人很多，而她自已則住在院外，所以詳情也不知道，不過她吿訴了我們一些醫院裏的情形，她說送進來的病人個個都因爲被虐待拷打的結果，已經病得很厲害，而且病人不論痊愈或死亡，一槪要交還憲兵隊，繼續監禁或加以埋葬。此外她也聽說憲兵殺人常在午夜北門以外。最後她另外指點我們一條路，去訪一位自縣立醫院開始一直到解散爲止，始終在院裏祖任事務員的陳雲洲老先生。</p>
<p>無頭緒親訪荒塚</p>
<p>陳老先生家住在城內七弦河的駱駝浜，好容易轉輾探聽，才知道了他家的門脾號數，這可以說已是我們最後一個希望了。門開開來，一位中年婦人堅欲問明來意，我們托稱是陳老先生的朋友，是來拜望拜望他的，她才讓我們進去。在客堂裏候了幾分鐘，陳老先生支着拐杖走出來了，他兩頰深凹，頭戴瓜皮帽，身穿薄棉襖褲，據說是大病初愈，所以聲音低微，氣調短促，我們對他說明來意，也再三吿訴他此事對他決無關係，希望他就其所知，儘量說出來。然而，我們所得到的依舊還是失望，他說實在不知道內情，原因是最後一任院長金紹周，據他說是「精括」到了極點，甚至連病人遺留的牙刷肥皂，都由他親自接收，並且還以他的姪子改名吳傳東，在院內包辦一切，因此，陳雖然做了管理員，實際上一點事都管不到，要探聽此事詳情，似乎非要去追尋那在匿的金紹周不可了。</p>
<p>從陳雲洲君處辭出以後，感到找尋綫索的困難，似乎已有不能達成任務的感覺，可是因爲從以上各處探聽的結果，均謂當時被敵憲慘殺的愛國志士，均埋葬在北門外的山脚下，我們雖已走得萬分疲倦，但仍抱着或有希望的徼倖心理，鼓起精神，向水北門出發，做一個最後的試探。沿着駱駝浜，打了幾個灣，憑着高督學對於本城路徑的熟悉，由一個城脚下農塲穿過，（農塲現在已徒具虛名，祇有雜草及無數義塚），不久水北門就呈現在眼前，走出城門，見有戴着鋼盔的國軍和警察，站在城門外橋上，那條橋刻有「八七橋」字樣，據說在抗戰初期，曾有陸軍八十七師駐紥過，該橋即爲該師與民衆合作建成。</p>
<p>這就是不加思索</p>
<p>過橋向左轉灣，見山脚下有一家茶館，（後麥知道茶館呌山樓居），正有一桌穿短衣的村民在高談闊論，興高採烈地喝茶，我們便走上去把探聽米村案子的意思吿訴他們，問他們是否知道，豈知我們一說「米村」兩字，大家異口同聲地說：「這傢伙在常熟是婦孺皆知，殺人不砭眼的兇狠魔鬼」。這一來引起了他們的興緻，大家爭相問着「米村已經捉到了嗎」？我們給了他們一個肯定的回答。接着李主任問他們知道關於吳雨蒼，胡家棟，聞星五，葉振飛，兪子範等五人被殺的情形嗎？出乎意料地，他們居然滿足了我們的期望，原來他們都是當地的「忤作」，當初敵憲殺人時，有時他們偸偸地看到，因此其中有一個人就不加思索地說：「被殺的有許許多多，掩埋的地方我們倒曉得，有十幾處之多」！這來，使我們由絕望而變爲希望，使人想起「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一邨」的句子來。於是就問他們可否領我們去找尋，他們莫不樂意地表示願爲響導，全體從桌旁站了起來，陪我們向目的地出發，約莫五分鐘光景，到了天合崗的地方，他們指着一堆隆起的土堆說：「這就是」！其中二個人連忙吿拿了釘耙來，非常起勁地挖掘幾個站在旁邊的人說：「敵寇的毒辣手段，野蠻得簡直不是人類所能想象，現在它們倒底自食其果了」，言下不勝慘愴和憤慨，更有一個老年人，手舞足蹈地痛屬着敵人的毫無天良，頗有怒髮衝冠的氣槪。</p>
<p>沒有頭忠骨挖到</p>
<p>忽然聽得釘耙與什麽東西相碰的聲音，其中一個人說：「當心，骨頭已挖到了，不要使它弄碎」！言猶未畢，赫然就見幾根相壯的肢骨經繼續挖掘，一連挖出了十幾根大的肢骨和肋骨，肩骨，脊骨等，更有一團已呈紫色的腐化的頭髮。使每個人臉上印出了一種不可名狀的悲憤恐懼的色彩。我們追問爲怎麼頭顱不看見呢？另一位頭紥花布，手提農具，大約五十歲左右的老婦人說：「聽說這個洞裏當初一共殺死兩人，一個是殺頭的，一個是刺死的，那殺下來的頭被憲兵帶去獻給上峯，另外一個頭顱，因爲露在泥土外面，被野犬等吃去了，所以這洞裏祇存身體部分的骨頭，而沒有頭顱骨了」。我們聽了那婦人的話，不禁毛　悚然。一面把掘出來的骨頭拍了兩張照片，並請在旁的人用一只竹製的畚箕盛着那兩貝爲國捐軀的　骨。據談：這兩個無名英雄的死，已是三年前的事了。這時已在下午四點了，我們要求那幾位挖掘的人再去掘他們所曉得的胡家棟的葬骨之所。那地方在離天台崗不遠的虞山脚下，密佈着無人管理的山草，人走在裏面。祗露出了胸部以上的一段，格外顯出境地的悽凉。</p>
<p>在一顆栗子樹的旁邊，發現了胡家棟忠魂的土堆，據他們說：胡家棟的母親，在今年五月間曾到這裏來挖掘過他兒子的遺骸，她滴了血在這骷髏的骨頭上，因爲未被骨頭吸進去，她就以爲這並不是他兒子的遺骸。在這裏幾乎哭得死去活來！這使每個人聽了都覺得如乎在身上澆了一盆冷水似的。這種所謂滴血，是最不合理的古時試驗方法，可說絕對沒有準確的把握，因爲在泥土裏挖出來的骨頭有很潮濕的血怎能吸得進呢？這法子不知在世上添了多少寃抑的事情。忽然大家停止了談話，眼前赫然呈現着血痕斑斑的頭頗，筆直地豎在泥洞中，雖是有十餘人在塲的光天日化之下，大家也都不免有一點可怕的情緒。</p>
<p>被活埋像拔木椿</p>
<p>照常例，屍骨的頭和脚是在同一的平面上，頭總是向天的，而這一具遺骸却逈異尋常，頭上脚下成爲站立狀態，從泥土中緊緊的拿出，好像拔出木樁一般，細鈿一看，上下　仍似活人狀態，而少了幾只門牙，牙齒是長在顎的內部，萬無獨缺之理，　想一定是當初被敵憲擊落無疑。還有幾個年老的農夫，手中拿　竹桿製的旱烟管，看了不禁老淚橫流使我們每個人欲言無語了。據說：在三十二年的春夏之交，敵憲濫捕愛國志士及無辜民衆，死的數以百計，胡家棟死的情形是這樣的：光由敵憲掘了洞，然後牽了他來，呌他跑下洞去站着，敵憲在槍上裝了刺刀，恨命地猛　，只聽得「阿呀」一聲，就直倒在洞裏，這是一個農失從遠處圍牆內親目所睹的報吿·然後再走到一處呌張家墳的地方。鄕民說：「這裏也有一具屍骸，和胡家　差不多時候死的；當初敵　用蒲包綑綁後才埋入的」，我們便停步再行挖掘，不到一尺深，果然發現了又一個頭顱，也是直挺挺插在泥中。</p>
<p>火車上帶來骷髏</p>
<p>景像够慘了，再加上荒草夕屬，枯樹歸鴉，我們實在不忍也不能再挖掘了。因此就請鄕民把這些枯骨先扛至縣政府內，一路上看的人途爲之塞，可以說轟動了整個縣城。當晚，這堆人骨寄存在慧日寺中。</p>
<p>第二天，我們考慮之餘，決定先行返滬，將來有必要時再去發掘。已掘出的兩顆人頭和人骨，就裝在蒲包中，一路乘汽車火車拎到上海，假如跟我們同車的人曉得我們手裏提的是骷髏骨頭，他們眞不知要鬧出怎樣驚駭的笑話來呢！現在，人頭和人骨已安置在軍事法庭裏，最短期內即將成爲重審米村春喜時的有力證據了。</p>
<p>挖掘完畢後鄉民與縣府高督學（立於記者後）及記者合影</p>

<h3>對義和約逐條表決　莫洛托夫昨在和會演說　堅主全百諒解排斥組織結峙集團</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：巴黎和會今日繼續討論對義和約，可於今晚或至遲明晚可吿完成。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎九日緊急廣播：今日和會大會中，以十四對五票，兩票棄權，通過對美和約內有關義南邊界之第三條及第十七，十八，十九條關法義間確定界綫之特別規定、。對有關義奧邊界之條款，以十對六票之三分之二多數獲得通過，一票棄權。至於有關義南曁義希之各項條款，頃亦未遭反對，獲得通過。</p>
<p>又訊：和會今日一致通過對義和約第四項第十一條有關南斯拉夫共和國之特別規定，以及同項第十二條有關希屬鳥嶼杜特坎尼斯，有關割讓領土內人民國籍問題之第十三條等特別條款。</p>
<p>又訊：和會一致通過第五條，宣稱義大利及南斯拉夫小組委會將確定兩國邊界綫問題。又南斯拉夫擬變更確定特港自由區界綫之第十六條而提出之修正案，頃業經十四對五票遭否決，兩票棄權。</p>
<p>又訊：波蘭對第十四，十五條，即禁止軍事機構及政府機關內雇用法西斯份子之兩條所提修正案，頃以十對九票遭否決，兩票棄權。又南斯拉夫所提確定特港自由區田綫草案之修正案，亦經十四對五票遭大會否決，兩票棄權。</p>
<p>又訊：美對特港地位所提建議，頃以十四對六票獲得通過，一票棄權。和約內規定以特港領土置於安理會管制下之條款，在未遭反對下獲得通過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕和會全體會議主席即蘇代表莫浴托夫，本日在代表寥落之會議席上發表演說，歷時三十分鐘。莫氏讚揚四强之合作，重由蘇聯堅主全面諒解，並排斥組織對立集團之政策，莫氏之言曰，四强間之合作較聯合國機構更爲可恃，此乃一切困難之綫索。和會所發現之分裂，僅爲人爲性質，全體代表應出以諒解與誠意，以樹立世界永久之和平。聯合國戰勝法西斯主義，代價何等重大，故有樹立永久機構之必要。吾人自一九一九年之和平解決（指第一次大戰後之凡爾賽和約）獲得敎訓，認爲此種和平務必爲民主的，對於爲共同主張而犧牲者應一視同仁。和平解決如爲民主的及永久的，則必須確保法西斯主義之消滅，而到處鼓勵民主之滋長。義大利雖爲法西斯主義之搖籃，但對義和約並不苛刻。和約全文爲四强贊同、並經和會一致通過，雖有時不免各方查難，但此種責難未必正當。各項修正案之能過，使草約原文並無多大變動，由是觀之，四强之合作頗有效果。但四強所不和之處，和會亦未能獲得一致解決，惟其如此，四強之合作應予維持。外間以和會分成對立棄團爲言，殊不知蘇聯對於任何分裂，均所反對，而堅持成立全體諒解。所謂斯拉夫各國欲樹立反英美陣綫一說，並非事實。此種企圖在許多年前，容或有之，但此際並無此種危險，目前各個青年民主國家已自東歐土地蹶起，各該國家僅求公平與合法待遇，別無野心，一部份外交家企岡組織西方集團，印度中國及阿比西尼亞之被邀參加集團，令人驚異。此其目的，無非欲在和會中獲得較多票數而已。要之，全體國家應重視諒解與誠意，以建立民主的和平。若干國家如不欲對他人稱霸，並能就若干點成立協議，則民主的和平終有實施之可能云。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕莫洛托夫在和會全體會議中，反對業種經義政治及領土委員會通過之法國所擬特里埃斯特自由區方案，主張使自由區之地位，與第一次大戰後之但澤自由市相仿。莫氏指採納法國方案，實違背外長會議決議，該一方案對自由區之立法議會限制太多，而給與行政長官以太廣這權限。莫氏並要求和會確定外國軍隊自特港撤退之日期。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕和全全體大會每日三次，各代表疲於年命。昨晚第五次會議，出席者不過三十人，各代表　於會議之進展，似少興趣，一般印象殆以爲一切業已定奪，繼續討論無濟於事。但南斯拉夫代表卞特吉仍以對義和約與南國不利爲言，並以義南邊界綫若照法國提議者劃分，南國將拒絕在和約簽字爲威脅。斯拉夫各國代表熱烈鼓掌，但英美代表鮮加注意，英代表團長亞力山大呼呼大睡？本日午前繼續會議，仍由蘇聯外長莫洛托夫主席，紐西蘭代表發言，籲請各國對於國際關係前途，應出以樂觀，不可作杞人之憂</p>
<h3>美將對蘇聯要求　提供國外駐軍情報</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：美國政府今日致電刻在巴黎之國務卿貝爾納斯，請其核准國務院之一項計劃。按蘇聯前曾在安全理事會要求聯合各國說明其留駐於非敵性國家之軍隊、據悉，美國將支持蘇聯之建議、但不在安理會中予以支持，而在聯合國大會中支持之，因在聯合國大會中並無一國有否決權也。此外並有一條件，即各國必須說明其留駐於外國之車隊及地點，不論非敵性國或前散性國均在其內，以及究竟留駐若干時日，如此則莫斯科必領宣布蘇聯在朝鮮，中歐及巴爾幹各國所駐軍隊之數額及留駐之時日矣。</p>
<h3>英航空大臣任首席代表出席聯合國大會</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖八日電〕多瑙河航務國際會議，將在維也納舉行，聯合國秘書長賴依本日電邀美，英，法，蘇四強暨希臘南斯拉夫與捷克各國政府參加會議。</p>
<h3>琉球島主權應屬諸中國</h3>
<p>美高級官員見解</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕美國外交界人士坦白預料蘇聯擬要求接管地位頗衝要之琉球羣島。據高級官員私下吿聯合社稱，美國將反對此預科中之蘇方行動，其理由爲琉球羣島如果轉移主權，應當交予中國，或將該羣島交聯合國委託管理而由中國單獨執掌行政事宜，則美國亦將同意。琉球羣島劃分太平洋公海與黃海，與蘇方有極大利害關係之大連與旅順，即在黃海一端。在若干方面，琉球羣島之情勢，或可與權靼尼爾海峽情勢相比擬，蓋蘇聯久謀取得入太平洋之出路。</p>
<h3>聯合國管制原子能　英重申合作決心　原子能法案獲國會通過</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦八日合衆電〕英首相艾德禮重申英國之決心，對聯合國委會制定之國際管制原子能計劃，予以完全合作。原子能法案規定英國所有原子能製造事宜，槪歸政府主持，在下院二讀通過，英國會自夏季休會以來，此乃首次大會。艾德禮稱，英國認爲原子彈之使用爲非法，渠稱，吾人盼望能禁用原子能，作爲軍事之目的。首相復透露，英政府所設原子能試騐站，經費約三千萬鎊，若欲繼續發展，必須再事增加。</p>
<h3>英軍將留駐希臘</h3>

<h3>行總新署长霍寶樹闡明今後工作方针　願努力改善几下上困难</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總新署長霍寶樹，於　日下午，假都城飯店作就任後首次記者招待會。首由行總編譯處代理處長田波烈作簡短介紹後。</p>
<p>霍氏即致詞稱：行總係爲人民服務之機關，亦目前爲國家謀救濟復興之機構，需要社會各方協助者頗多，願與各方多多接觸，行總一切公開，願藉諸君之力使社曾能知吾人之工作情形。行總過去在蔣廷黻先生主持之下，已奠立良好基礎，蓋蔣先生實爲一超越之人才，亦一偉大之學者，不僅爲我國第一次全國性善後救濟計劃之手創人，且在聯合國家會議席上，經其努力，使中國爲創造聯總之重要分子。本人惟願在其所奠之基礎上，繼續完成任務。</p>
<p>以往國內國外，對行總不免有所批評，其中有合理者固應設法補救，有誤會者則應加以解釋。有人以爲行總效率不足，不能迅速運輸物資，實則八年戰爭之後，我國交通大受損害，即黃浦江之運輸力亦不及前，自難充分發揮效率。且中國所得之物資，較希臘，義大利，南斯拉夫等國，所多無幾，以我國幅員之大，人口之多，所得之比例，實爲微乎其微，在此種情形下面欲求各方均能滿足，實甚困難。</p>
<p>中國人民之生活水準一向頗低，戰時所受困苦尤多，但行總只能救濟最切要救濟之難民，不能如聖誕老人一般到處送禮！</p>
<p>目前本人不能提出保證，惟望能以此有限度之物資，公平處理．本署同人，已經本人懇切挽留，深望彼等能秉菩薩心腸，造福災民，惟對行總內部，本人決加强其組織，以期人盡其材，各稱其職。</p>
<p>惟有一點今日即可公佈者：今後本人絕對以大公無私，非常公平之原則下，分配物資，並使工作迅速推動。費用常力求减少，因省下一個錢，災民即多一個錢之救濟．</p>
<p>霍氏最後以自信而愉快之語氣稱：本人硏究經濟，而在美國及國內，曾悉心研究運輸問題，故對運輸方面，決當以本人之學識經騐，設法改進，使效率得以增加，且本人近供職中國銀行，與各方接觸甚多，故財政方面，亦必可予以改善。</p>
<h3>戲法人人會變　各有巧妙不同　霍氏笑容記者問財政</h3>
<p>霍氏繼即於極融洽之空氣下，婉轉答覆各記者所提問題，茲擇要錄次：（一）問：行總是否仍擬出售物資？答：行總變賣救濟物資，有與聯總所訂之基本協定爲根據，較諸其他各國，所出售之比例甚微。但財政方面，補救之辦法甚多，實亦不止出售物資一種，詳情將米當可發表。（二）問：以後是否擬請外輸協助運輸？答：船隻之運用，應由政府決定，本人今日不能答覆此有關政府其他機關之問題。惟能多用中國的東西，自然最好。（三）問：在目前國內情形未盡安定之局面下，行總擬考慮修改原定之救濟程序否？答：救濟是普遍的，如事實上車子開不到，自應變換路綫，現行總正儘量設法使路綫皆能暢通，並向關係方面商洽。（四）問：陳納德將軍前曾建議，與行總合作，成立空運隊，此事進行情形何如？答：運輸有三個原則：快；便宜；安全。此外並應合乎需要。陳納德空運隊事，現在主管機關考慮中，至今日止，未聞有所決定，此事深信政府方面當有指示。（五）問：霍署長以爲該航空隊是否需要？答：各種交通工具，行總皆感需要。（六）問：聞行總已先付陳氏美金一百萬元，是否確實？答：本人未見有此文件。（七）問：行總在中共控制區域內，成立辦事處頗多，以後仍擬繼續添設否？答：中共控制區內之辦事處，仍繼續工作。是否增設新辦事處，當視需要而定。</p>
<p>記者曾於會後追詢霍氏解決行總財政問題之具體辦法，霍氏笑答：「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同！」神情灑然，足見胸有成竹；而數千萬嗷嗷待哺之災民，其命運亦即在霍署長之「戲法」中矣。</p>
<h3>陳納德昨飛返滬　航空綫成立有待</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕飛虎將軍陳納德，前日飛京晋謁蔣主席及有關方面，已於昨晚與秘書舒伯炎返抵此間，據陳氏語中央社記者，陳納德航空運輸綫之成立，現尙在洽商中，其法律顧問韋那氏，現尙留京繼續與有關方面商討。</p>
<h3>添設浮筒修復碼頭　港務會議限期實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市港務整理委員會，於昨（九日）上午十時，假市府會議室舉行第二次會議，決議（一）決定港務整理委員會之英文名稱爲The　Port　of　Shanghai　ReadjustmentCommission。（三）通過添設浮筒案，因原有丙級浮筒十八具，不適宜海洋船舶停泊，就原區調換甲級浮筒十具，並在江水較淺之處敷設丙級浮筒十具，以備航行沿海沿江船舶之用。（三）爲解決船位之擁擠。該會分別通吿各單位負責人，限期修復各碼頭，以利商船停舶起卸。（四）據丁委員貴堂稱：各碼頭在八年抗戰期間，久失疏濬，　洋船泊非待　　，不能出入，亟應加以疏濬，以利航行，結果議決交濬浦局詳細測量各碼頭水位後，提交下次會議決定。</p>
<p>末由公用局長趙曾玨提：將全市碼頭及附近倉庫，分區分組管理，俾得統一指揮與合理運用。擬分：（一）淺水組：以南市區碼頭倉爲基本。（二）深水組：暫定浦西外洋區，浦西近海區，浦東區三區，將來可擴展自江灣至吳淞江與京滬鐵路銜接，便利轉運國內外物資。（三）專業組：如煤炭·油料·軍用等，依其專業需要，分別分組，至於如何管理，如何劃分，擬請各委員詳細研究後，將意見送交該組整理，於下次會議時再付諸正式討論。</p>
<h3>同名互纏　潘老表歐人成傷　蔡老表代人受過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院刑三庭，昨審一傷害案，被吿蔡老表因同名被誤傳，代人受過，當庭宣吿無罪。緣西康路茂德里二十五號，有名潘老表，蔡老表兩人，蔡居前樓，潘則後樓，兩老表住所　　　　　　　。本年七月二十六日　　　時，潘老表因與同弄十入歲之小姑娘美根弟搶用自來水，發生爭吵，繼以毆鬥，潘老表雖已年老，然尙力壯，將姜根弟頭部打傷，蔡老表因誼屬隣居，乃出而調解無效，經新成分局訊問過後移送地檢處，由地撿處送法院起訴。唯姜根弟供述時，潘老表，蔡老表纏擾不淸，檢察處亦未聽眞，竟將潘老表誤塡爲蔡老表，昨日下午開庭，蔡老表無辜受審，大呼寃枉。吿訴人亦當庭申明，此老表非那老表。庭上旣知被吿弄錯無從審起，乃宣吿蔡老表無罪。如姜根弟仍欲控吿潘老表，則需依法定程序，重新具狀再吿。</p>
<h3>社局收容丐童　將設立習藝所</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局鑒於本市丐童，流浪街頭，爲數甚夥，有礙觀瞻，影響社會安全，故將於楊樹浦附近，設立習藝所，收容丐童，加以集中訓導，敎以謀生技能。漕河涇之難民難童收容所，將改爲第一習藝所，專事收容年在二十五歲以上者，偏重感化工作。本年內，該局尙擬增添婦女敎養所，收容妓女，並設殘廢敎養所。</p>
<h3>車站黃牛黨又活躍　黑市車票抬價二倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）最近京滬，滬杭綫鐵路客運又呈擁擠，購票益難。北站，虬江路營業所及中國旅行社，購票者之長蛇陣，盛况復見。售黑市票之黃牛黨又形活躍。據估計，京滬，滬杭兩綫車票，每日約有十分之一，落於黃牛黨之手。尤以對號入座之車票，多爲黃牛黨購去。對號車票隔日發售，渠等轉手出售之時間可較長，且旅客多喜乘對號車，脫售較易。黃牛黨多於北站附近徘徊，遇旅客入站時，輙趨前低詢：「票子要　？票子要　？」其所售價格，約爲票價之一倍至二倍。北站售票，係於車行前二小時或三小時開始。中國旅行社則係發售隔日車票。取締黃牛黨，路局方面，煞費苦心，終鮮成效。現正會同有關方面，積極商討有效辦法。</p>

<h3>明日起紗布南運　紡管會與關務署　已奉到政府命令　品目爲市布色布粗細斜　紗額總計紅五千餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗布輪往華南實行管理辦法規定六條，及其申請審核簡則規定八條，首見十月八日本報。茲悉：紡織事業管理委員會及關務署，確已於日前接奉行政院訓令，着即試辦。據悉：凡各地紗布輪往華南者，均適用此英辦法及簡則。現由紡管會及關務署會銜於明日起，公告二日，並定自明日起施行。至施行後名項處理手續，據記者探詢所得，分誌如次：（一）先由紡管會辦理紗布廠商登記。該會獲就登記表一種，內容着重創辦年月，財務狀況，組織情形，平均每月產銷數目，及每月購銷紗布數量，機器設備等項。（二）由紡管會核定各登記廠商之資格，已經核准者，將發給輪往華南紗布廠登記卡一紙。（三）持有登記卡之各廠商，如欲將紗布輪往華南，須先向紡管會填具紗布輪往華南出口許可證申請書，該項申請書，須注明輪往華南地點，品名，出品廠名，商標，件數，包裝，每件疋長度，淨重，總值，裝運船名，出口船期等項。紡管會於收到申請書後，即發給回執。（四）該項申請書核准後，即由紡管會掣發紗布輪往華南出口許可證。該項許可證爲四聯式，各聯內容，與申請書上所列各項略同，首聯爲報核聯，廠商輪往華南之紗布，憑該聯經海關驗核後，即准放行。該聯於貨抵目的地後，即交當地紡管會之專員收執登記。二聯爲甲種通知聯，紡管會於掣發首聯後，即將二聯同時寄送予出口海關，以便海關持憑核對。三聯爲乙種通知聯，由紡管會寄送紗布進口地之紡管會專員收執，以備紗布到達目的地時，再憑核對。四聯爲存查聯，由紡管會收執存量。</p>
<p>每月准許輸出數量</p>
<p>又關於上海每月准許輪往華南之紗布數量，籽由紡管會以民車廿五廿十六兩年華南各地（包括福州，廈門，汕頭，廣州四地）之內銷紗布進口數字爲根據，按照目前國內紗布總生產量，與戰前國內紗布總生產量之比例計算規定。（一）以總生產量言，民國廿五廿六兩年國內開工紗錠，爲五百萬錠。現時國內開工紗錠，尚不足二百五十萬錠。現時上海區（即指第六區機器紡織公會所屬各會員工廠）之開工紗錠，尚不足一百七十萬錠。（二）以民國廿五廿六兩年上海區輪往華南之棉紗數量言，每年之平均數量，爲一〇四·七三六件，每月之平均數量爲八·七二八件，則現時上海每月應准輪往華南之棉紗數量應爲8728×250/500×170/250=2987件。（三）以民國廿五廿六兩年上海區輪往華南之棉布數量言，每年之平均數量爲二·六六九·八八五疋，每月之平均數量爲二二二·四九〇疋，則現時上海每月應准輪往華南之棉布數量，應爲222490×250/500×170/250=75647疋。此項布疋，係以十二磅細布平均計算，折合綿紗，則爲二、二六九件。（四）由上推算，可知上海每月准弄輪往華南之綿紗總量，爲五·二三六件，約佔上海棉紗產量百分之七。可見數量甚微，無礙於本市供應去。</p>
<p>公債穩定</p>
<p>公債形勢穩定逾恒，成交約票面五百餘萬元，統丙晨開二四〇〇元，賣戶仍以零散居多，高價二四八〇元，某大戶逢高出籠，中途回低至二二五〇元，臨收站二三〇〇元以上，結果較前收續升八〇元，甲乙丁各大升五〇元，統戊祇好二〇元。</p>
<h3>銀錢各業休業慶祝雙十節</h3>

<h3>金價繼續上升　美鈔不易開展　港票已與港匯軋平</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以粵港金價高於滬市，買氣頗殷，晨開二二三萬，開後尚見平和，在二二二萬左右各有徘徊者甚久，十時後央行以二二二萬五之價，配給一八〇條，此後逐漸見穩，潮汕帮頗有套買，人心較堅，求過於供，繼旋而升，近午漲到二二三萬八，而後略有壓力，午刻站二二三萬光景，午後僅現貨交易，仍見堅定，結果較前收好一萬八，飾金掛念三萬六，紋銀平而銀元稍昂，暗拆銀根告鬆，息價自一角半至一角八不等。</p>
<p>外幣形趨榮，美鈔仍喊三五〇〇元至三五五〇元，並無成交，暗市成效價稍俏，價約四二〇〇元至四三〇〇元之間，惟交易因四川路一帶，偵查嚴厲，極難開展，結果與前收相較，都有回好，港票取而代之，求過於供，再漲三十元，港匯與港票業已軋平，被動帶高至九四〇元，印匯一一四〇元，英匯自一四七〇〇元扳高至一五〇〇〇元有售，美匯牌價未更，都無交易。</p>
<h3>布價評議會成立　評價辦法推三公會起草</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市社會局，以棉布爲民生主要物資，邇來市價暴漲，影響平民生計，特組設上海市棉布價格之機關，昨日下午四時，召開第一次委員會，出席委員顧炳元（社會局）潘士浩（市商局）吳味經（紡建公司）劉丕基（六區機紡業公會）張遵時（機器染織業公會）董久峰（棉布業公會）由社會局顧處長炳元主席首由主席報告審定棉布價格之意義，繼修正通過委員會章程，則推定六區機紡業公會染織業公會及棉布業公會負責起草（一）棉由標準，（二）棉布成本，（三）批發利潤，（四）處罰辦法，交由下次會議討論。</p>

<h3>讀報有感</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>記得有一次某報副刋上出過一個特刊，請了幾位「知名之士」爲文指導讀者如何讀好報。他們吿訴過我們一張好的報紙應該具備的是一些甚麽條件。但我們知道一張報裏面主要的材料應該是新聞，而這些新聞應該是客觀的報導。</p>
<p>客觀的報導是一件很不容易做到的事體。同一件事體在立塲不同的人們看起來，就會發生不同的反應，而他們的報導又逃不了這種反應的影營。所以我們可以坦白的說一句，一切的報吿，多少總帶有一點主觀色彩的。所以一張報紙上所紀敝的消息不能完全客觀，這是不可厚非的。不過有些人們故意藉口某些事情而大吹大擂，以至歪曲事實，淆惑聽聞，這是沒良心的勾當，萬不足取！至於編者們取捨材料，雖自有其客觀的標準，但也免不了主觀的態度。見智見仁，各自不同，原也未可强同。不過有些先生們以故意選載一些淆惑聽聞的消息爲能事，這便有失報人的天職。</p>
<p>這一切的一切都可以不顧，但至少我們要能够在一張報紙上找到多少新聞，讀到若干消息。可是近日我們常常看見某些報紙上大部分都是「社論」「讀者意見」「專論轉載」以至於某某「專家」的演講稿！我們雖不一定要求它是一張「好報」，但至少我們可以要求它應該是一張「報」紙啊！</p>
<p>此地使我們想起了宣傳的技巧和報人的身份兩個問題。巧於宣傳的人並不在乎開口便是漫罵。要知道一般人固然是喜歡聽別人駡人，但是聽駡聽得太多便也會覺得討厭。至於從事於新聞事業的人們也不是政治宣傳家的發言人。他們應該保持一種正義感和超然的態度，否則，便有失報人的身份了。</p>
<h3>與谷春帆先生論「中國工業化計劃」</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>谷春帆先生著中國工業化計劃論爲我國假擬一個五年計劃，參考蘇聯的計劃經濟，德國的統制經濟，英美的指導經濟，主張實行一種混合經濟，剴切詳明，別具匠心，近來關於我國工業化的著作，自孫中山先生底實業計劃以後，殆未有出其右者。孫先生底民生主義，如欲見諸實行，此書確是最好的參考品，尤其是在官僚政治，官僚資本盛極一時的今日，要想勵行經濟建設，他主張把國家直接做的工業，縮到最小部份；執行的機稱，應採取歐美通行的公營的公司制度；而政府在管理方面，應使指導的事業多於統制；我們更覺得用心良苦。</p>
<p>可惜他所主張應行配合的那一套政策：如微收大地主之土地或其超額地租，如普通收支必須平衡，法幣之對內對外價値必須平定，物價必須平穩，發行政策必須嚴格；如貿易政策，在數量上須减少輸入，同時須增加輸出；如工資當與物價同予穩定等；像現在和平統一無法實現，不知何日纔能實行？但是這些都是屬於政治方面，只要政府有決心不難隨時實現。惟有最後谷先生所講工業化成功的條件，倒是一個最尷尬的問題，而關係中國工業化底前逮又最大，我們却願站在諍友的地位，略略商榷一番。</p>
<p>關於工業本身上底條件，現在姑讓國際經濟來補充，暫且不提，現在我們認爲最重要而不能聽憑自然的淘汰，只是「對於傳統文化的決擇與保留」一個問題。究竟應該決擇些什麼？保留些什麽？據谷先生說：「西方的工業文明與我們的傳統文明絕不相伴。西方人勇猛精進，求高求太的進取精神，正與我們知足不辱，退讓謙遜的停滯文明相反，吾們要工業化，就得採取這種工業化的精神。」又說：「我們要工業化，我們得改革整個社會，整個文化。在道德思想方面，我們要採取西方人勇猛精進，事事認眞、講權利講公德這種態度，我們不可堅執傳統以來的明哲保身，模稜兩可，得過且過，馬馬虎虎的態度？……我們的固有哲學，固有道德，正是農業社會的哲學與道德，其中誠有很多可取之處，値得保存，也會得保存，但以農業社會，農業生產的精神來辦理工業化的生產，誠如傅斯年先生所云拖着四千年的垃圾　迎頭趕上，決無可能。……因爲社會是整個的一套，要改得全改。要工業化，要計劃，要掃除一切農業社會遺傳的束縛。」這幾段話裏面有三點意思：第一點社會是整個的，要改便須全改；第二點，中國底傳統文明，是農業社會產生的文明，不合辦理工業生產；第三點，其中也有很多値得保存的，「如自己不能正確的認識決擇，……則工業化之進行，自能滌垢蕩瑕，排除奮文明中不合式的汚點，而保留其他無害的傳統生活」。</p>
<p>就第一點講，誠然，近代社會學者，大都承認社會是整個的有機體，但「萬化皆漸而無頓的」宇宙公例，至今也選是有效的公例。任何有機體的改變都是慢慢的，一部份一部份的改變，只要在改進的路上，它終久總是前進的。這看看英美德法日俄那些工業國，各有各的作風；便可知道社會改革的情形，不是一致，決不能刻板的說一改都改。如果操之過切，動不動講澈底，痛快是痛快，可是改革底條件配合不上，結果是有破壞而無建設。這是古今中外社會底普通現象，無可否認。所謂突變突創，只是偶然否變例，不可强求。</p>
<p>第二點，在唯物史觀的人們看來，郤也不錯，他們應用馬克斯恩格爾說明西洋社會歷史的方法，來說明中國底社會歷史。但中國底社會歷史，是不是和西洋一樣呢？這種說明方法對不對呢？我們是贊成「心身一元」的，對於唯心派底「萬法唯心」底說法，固不見得合乎眞理，對於唯物派那種一切精神文明都建築在經濟基礎上面底見解，也不敢苟同。不必高談哲學，不必遠徵博引，就單照唯物派底觀點說：同樣性質的社會，應該產生同樣性質的文明。何以從歷史上看，各國農業社會產生的文明，並不一樣，不顯見一種文明底發生，必含有其他因素，決不全靠經濟嗎？我國周禮與管子二書，是世界講統制經濟最古的書，其中所講多屬關於工商部門底政策制度，難道這也是農業社會所產生的農業文明嗎？就退一步講，農業文明也不見得就會妨害工業生產力的解放。英國底產業革命，不是由農業社會發展出來的嗎？若說農業文明偏於保守；英吉利是世界最保守的民族，也是世界進步最快的民族。現代關於政治經濟社會各方面底新花樣，那一樣不是它開端？十八世紀以來的西洋文明，可說全由它領導。若說現代工業生產，與法國的人權革命，美國的獨立革命有關，那德意志從沒有發生過什麽人權革命，獨立革命，政治經濟社會，都另外有它一套學說，怎麼也工業化了，而且駸駸乎後來居上呢？此無他，科學敎育發達而已。科學敎育發達，農業社會也可變而爲工業社會，否則任憑怎樣改革，終無補於經濟建設。</p>
<p>然則在中國社會裏邊，有沒有阻礙科學敎育發達的東西？如有的話，是什麽東西？換句話講就是　　　　的傳統文明是些什麽？谷先生原另外著有一本「工業化與中國文明」，據說還沒有出版，我們不能瞎猜說了些什麽。單照這本書所指摘的傳統文明來購，大槪是釋道一派底道德思想。道家主張無爲，不尙賢，絕　　智，不會難得之貨。又主張知白守黑，知雄守雌，不爲天下先。這種思想，純是消極的。所以，以知止知足，退讓謙遜爲美德。以明哲保身，模稜兩可，得過且過，馬馬虎虎爲處世秘訣。應用到政治上便成爲愚民政策。應用到經濟上，便成爲老死不相往來的小農自給政策。儒家雖然也講謙讓，但儒家尙賢，故其謙讓是禮賢讓賢，而「當仁則不讓」。故於社會仍有積極建設的意義。不像道家以退爲進，欲取固予，全出於虛僞陰險的計較。儒家也講明哲保身，但危邦不入，亂邦不居，是指不在其位而言。若在位，便當見義勇爲，甚至於舍生取義。不可與道家的一味「和光同塵」「與世浮沉」混爲一談。總而言之，我國社會受老佛消極思想底支配二千餘年，很普通，而又很深固，所以傳統文化很早就停滯了，而且變了質。儒家不過擺在旁邊做樣子，秦以來眞正儒家底學說，實在沒一次運用過，十三經不過是士子獵取功名的工具。一般皮相之士，還在那裘說儒敎是中國社會思想底正統，無形中做了佛老底躱箭牌。有些熱心改革的人士，以爲舊文化都是儒家造成的，要改革舊文化，便要打倒孔子，推翻儒學，這眞寃枉極了。我今天說上這麽一大篇話，無非想把那躱在後面支配了我國社會經濟政治數千年的佛老立說，明白指示出來，使大家知道要談改革，便要首先改革佛老的消極精神。這種精神，不但拖住了我國不進化，並不知不覺使我們開倒車，如不把它革掉，怎想發展生產力？</p>

<h3>雙十的迴憶</h3>
<p>— 覺非</p>
<p>一個北土的秋晨，晶明而溫煦的日色照耀在西山之上。受日光的一面顯出赭色，而日光所不到的一面則鬱然一片暗紫；使人想起國畫中之淺綘山水，皴染之妙者，眞能寫出自然之　味。「秋盡江南草未凋」，在幽燕的原野中也可以見得到的。楊柳的葉有點萎黃了，夜來的悲風吹散些在地上，但是晨光一照，又恢復了婀娜的舞腰。至於厚勁的槐樹不容易爲風所動，依然保存着鬱鬱蒼蒼之貌，重陽前後的秋光總是如此的了。使人感念年光之銷逝，而棖觸無窮的往事。</p>
<p>這一年的雙十節是在這樣的景物中點綴的，分明是民國十一年，黎元洪剛復職不久，在這一天早晨就西苑的兵營舉行閱兵典禮。自從民國七年第一次世界大戰勝利在徐世昌任總統之下舉行一次慶祝閱兵之後，連年內爭，久矣乎沒有這種具有國際禮儀的公式集會了。而且自洪憲帝制運動以後，北京政府的合法地位就已經動搖，一直沒有可以堂堂芷正招待外賓紀念國慶的機會；大概軍警的制服都已破舊，官吏的車馬也不齊全，要發一筆典禮用款也非在鹽餘裏特別設法不可了。黎氏爲　吳所擁戴而復職，在未就職前發了一個魚電以廢督裁兵爲條件，而復黎一舉可以象徵以前護國進法運動之結束，一時人心頗有后來其蘇之感。其第一任內閣以王寵惠爲首班，曾經和蔡元培胡適同署名　　力周報「我們的政治主張」那篇文章，大受好人　　的稱贊；這一次的國慶特別勉力掙扎着點綴一下，是大家所聊以自慰的。但是一面點綴，一面已經發生了政潮，王內閣竟爲曹派所排擠而動搖，黎氏的政治運命已經注定。他的公式出席就這第一次也就是最末次了；不但是他，北京政府的國慶閱兵典禮也從此不再出現了。</p>
<p>往事分明尙在眼前，黎氏魁梧厚實的軀幹，謙和凝重的態度，在這種塲所出現更足以顯出其適宜，當他步入禮塲之時，料想也正中心回憶十一年前武昌的舊夢。這次總指揮官是王懷慶，老了。黎氏騎上白色的名馬出發檢閱，大總統的錦旗在前引導着，馳驟自如，時時舉手答禮，頭上的烏羽冠受微風而翻起一層層的雪浪，這種烏羽柔軟而下垂，是非常名貴的。其他陪從的人只有外交官與蒙古世爵　的羽冠是純白的捲毛，軍警高級將校只是絲綫做的纓而已。這班人的軍禮服大概在張作霖就大元帥職的時候方才又穿過一次罷。</p>
<p>這是前清禁衛軍的營房，萬壽山排雲殿與王泉之塔高峙於右，圓明園的廢墟橫亘於左，馳道上的石板不知經過了多少的馬蹄，迎風披拂的樹枝不知目送了多少的冠裳劍佩，在夕陽影中常是這樣的默想。</p>
<h3>少女</h3>
<p>— Sir　　Thomas　Lawrence</p>
<h3>武昌起義挿曲　黎元洪是否床下拖出</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>中華民國開國前一年，十月十日，革命黨志士在武昌起義，那時很像羣龍無首，都督一職，照當日革命黨地位而說，劉公爲共進會總理，較爲適合，其次是孫武，蔣翊武，但他們或因傷留在醫院，或因交通阻滯，不能擔任。而當時有些人着眼在黎元洪的原因，是因當時發難的黨人，草野起義，恐難號召。黎是淸軍將領，頗得兵心，擁他做領袖，似是一時的人選。因此，時勢造英雄（？），黎元洪夤緣時會，於是被擁爲都督。黎也因此一帆風順，由都督而副總統，大總統了。</p>
<p>爲什麼說黎元洪的出任都督，是夤緣時會呢，因爲黎根本不是革命黨，絕沒有認識革命主義，只是被逼出來靠着機會，在民國政治中混了十幾年，混名「黎菩薩」，顯名思義，可知黎的爲人了。</p>
<p>關於黎的出處，說來也可發一笑，究竟是怎樣的呢，在許多的史事裏，都是從他家裏的牀下拖出來的，如文公直的「中華民國革命史」（民國十七年三月再版）有說：</p>
<p>「時，革命軍尙無首領（孫武因在漢口製造炸彈，受傷未愈。留滬領袖，又一時不能到鄂）。衆議以新軍協統黎元洪當之。張振武·方維·赴黎元洪寓中，黎　牀下，張振武　得之，迫令出爲都督，否則槍斃，以免亂新軍之心。黎元洪不得已，勉强允諾。……」</p>
<p>這是明明說　是　在床下，給黨人逼他出來的。鄒魯的「中國國民黨黨史稿」（民國廿七年初版，卅三年再版。）所說和文公直所述，大同小異，如云：「武漢三鎭全入我軍手後，乃計劃組織軍政府。</p>
<p>「……而劉公在漢口，倉卒不能渡江，所請黃與等又未到，急切不得人選。劉　（原書誤廣）藻曰：『統領黎元洪現在城內，若合選，當導覓之』。衆贊成。蔡濟民率少數同志偕劉往。黎聞人聲嘈雜，入室匿牀下，蔡等出之，擁至諮議局。」只看此兩段，已經不同，文公直所說是由張振武，方維二人到黎的住所，鄒魯所說是由蔡濟民率同志數人，會同劉賡藻前往，去的人雖不同，而黎匿在牀下是相同的。在二三十年來，無論書籍的訊載，或是口頭的談傳，差不多衆口一詞的都說黎元洪躲在自己寓所牀下，給黨人拖出來的。這種寫述或口傳，多屬輾轉傳述，而非親自參加此役的寫述，難免別有作用，或是以訛傳訛，習非成是，成了開國史的笑話了。現在把湖北籍的黨人而且也是參加兩湖革命的老同志的著述撮錄，自然較可徵信的。曹亞伯一武昌革命眞史」（民國十九年出版）有說：</p>
<p>「……少頃，馬榮，程正瀛二人報吿，謂第二十一混成協協統黎元洪尙在武昌城內，現拿有黎元洪之護兵前來爲證等情。吳兆麟當命馬榮，程正灜等帶兵一排，由所獲之黎元洪護兵作響導。……馬榮，程正瀛等帶隊至黃土坡劉文吉家，先將其家前後包圍，然後闖門而入，其勢洶洶。劉之護兵，問此來何爲。大衆謂來請黎協統。護兵不敢指示，又不回答。於是大衆直至臥室搜查。斯時黎元洪心已失主，焦灼之狀，露於顏色。……」</p>
<p>這是說黨人前去的是馬榮，程正瀛，由黎的護兵引導到劉文吉的家，不是黎的住宅，黎也不是匿在牀下，只說是在臥室搜查而已。參加武漢起義的黨人胡祖舜所寫「六十談往」（民國卅三年六月出版）有說：</p>
<p>「當其時，天已近曙，先是熊秉坤派湯啓發率一支隊巡查中和門前後街一帶，瞥見有人肩負皮箱一口，自混成協統領黎元洪宅而出。啓發等疑爲盜刦者，叱止之，詢其所自來，將何所往。始知爲黎之伙夫。乃黎令其取出移送他處以密藏者。再三盤詰，復知黎走避於黃土坡其參謀劉文吉家。啓發等曾訪黎而不得者，遂跟蹤而往，黎適與其執事官王安瀾等座談，見啓發等驟至，事出倉卒，不問情由，乃驚起曰：『我黎某治軍素寬厚，汝輩何得來謀我！』衆曰：『非也，我輩非謀害統領而來，乃係請統領出而主持大計者。」……」照此，到劉文吉家的，不是張振武，方維，也不是蔡濟民，劉賡藻，更不是馬榮，程正灜，而是湯啓發，地點也不是黎的寓所，而是黎的參謀劉文吉家，湯啓發的前去，是由巡查得着綫索，沒有報吿過其他幹都同志，便請黎出來，而和黎相見之時，黎適和王安瀾座談，絕非匿在自己寓所的牀下。叙述中比較詳細的，要算胡祖舜的著述，胡是參加此役的幹部人物，此說較爲可靠。張難先的「湖北革命知之錄」（民國卅四年十一月出版），在各黨史中比較最後出版，而且張是參加武漢起義的同志，在書裏有說：</p>
<p>「……省議員劉賡藻（字孝臣，保康人。）曰：「統領黎元洪現在城內，若合選，當導覓之。』衆贊成。蔡濟民率少數同志，偕劉往。先是馬榮，湯啓發巡街至黎宅，見伕役擔三皮箱出，疑爲匪，詰之，稱奉黎統領命來取。問統領何在，不敢答，迫詢，始允導至黃土坡劉宅，指黎所在。黎聞嘈雜聲，避入房內，馬湯力懇出見，黎叱而出曰：「余帶兵十餘年，自問待汝等不薄，何與余爲難也！』衆曰：『吾等無惡意，請統領出，主持大計。』黎曰：『革命黨人，人材濟濟，要余何用？』……』</p>
<p>張所叙述，大意和胡祖舜所述略同，所不同的，佚役携皮箱一個與三個的數目不同，胡是說黎正與王安瀾座談，湯啓發等突然而來。張却說湯啓發等到劉家時，黎是避入房內，有沒有匿在牀下，沒有提及，只說馬湯等力懇出見。</p>
<p>由以上幾說合攏看來，革命黨人之找黎元洪出任都督，是利用黎當時在新軍中的資望，便於號召統馭部隊而已。至黎的受逼而出，是不在自己的寓所，而在他的參謀劉文吉家，是可確信。誰人去尋覓他出來，那在比較中要以馬榮湯啓發程正三人較爲可信。湯等到了劉宅，黎聞人聲嘈雜，驚惶失措的躱入房內，也在情理之中，因黎在房內不肯出，馬湯等力懇出見。所謂「力」者，含義却很微妙了。</p>
<p>總之，黎元洪不是革命黨，碰着革命黨人起義，想着逃避隱匿，即彼擁到楚望台，還說：「汝等事情太閙大了，如何得了？』（見湖北革命知之錄）又衆人請黎下令作戰，黎曰：「總督署雖下，瑞澂張彪在逃，一旦水陸進攻，旣無援軍，又無糧餉，汝輩有所準備？我曾學海軍，如海圻等軍艦，武昌僅須三砲，即可全燬，汝輩不知利害，我勸各自回營休息，再行商議。』（見六十談往）這些都是反革命的論調。後來李翊東拿一預寫安民佈吿，請黎在都督銜下，寫一黎字，黎也拒絕，李即用槍威脅，黎也不肯。最後李憤而代寫，即交書記繕發分貼全城。章炳麟所作的黎公碑，說「……謀帥無適任者，以公善拊御，皆屬意公，議定三月矣，陰爲文吿署檢，稱大都督黎，未知吿也」。這些話，是章炳麟阿其所好而說。武漢革命黨人，事先雖有推舉黎元洪任都督之一說，但沒有在三個月以前，用黎元洪的名義預印文吿。且都督沒有大字在上，這些都是章替黎鋪張，諛墓之辭而已。</p>

<p>「我先念一封信上的幾句話給您；聽」w君抽出一疊信箋，翻過了幾頁。這疊信箋，我在長辛店見過，所以一到眼睛裏，就知道是耀羣寫給鶴見的那封長函：「——古君，您給我介紹這位老師，雖說是個　國的人，對於我國人情·風俗·軍事·政治，我看却比我們國內的一般軍政要人，怕要淸楚得多。他不斷地給我錦輸了許多世界大勢，和我國現局的情狀。受了他的　　，我認爲我已經明瞭我的崗位在哪裏，我的職務是什麽！古君，人類固然是一種有情感的動物，但人類的感情，也並不一定要放在男女戀愛的一件事上，　有很多工作，需要我們充分的熱情去幹。這一點我不敢說是我的新發見，但我現在寫了出來，爲的是要給您一個保證；保證我決不會讓我的感情來阻礙您的事業……。」</p>

<p>「「古君—這封信再要沒有回響，我得先向您吿罪—我預備自己行動了……在寨子裏我常聽說，通縣的股汝耕，很想把河北一帶，造成第二個東北，討好他的日本主子，我很想去把他幹掉。只可惜我自來沒見過他，不知他是如何的形像；這得花費一點時間去辦……我吿訴您這話，讓您知道我的决心如何！」」</p>
<p>w君念到這裏，才把那一大疊信箋，很愼重地整齊放下，又取出一封日本式的箋紙，對我笑了一笑，「寫這封信的人，大槪象一定猜想得到，我且把有關耀羣的事，念了出來，您大概就明瞭她和虎城在通縣的任務，如何吃重了。說到這裏，便把鶴見的信展開，默默看了幾行。才又對我說，「您聽……」</p>

<h3>祝</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>十字是最聖神最莊嚴的記號，基督的十字架代表偉大，救世。和犧牲；十字軍東征，代表光榮和解放；我們的國慶日，吳稚暉老先生查出日期是陽暦十月十日，定名雙十節來，實在是巧合，而兩個十字，在今日想來，的確有雙重受難的意味。</p>
<p>然而「十」又表示「全」的意思，故俗語有所謂十全十美。倘使過去道三十四度佳節，我們都能把握機會，黽勉無懈，不自暴自棄，我們的日子當不致這樣的難過，而國家一定也可躋於富强康樂之境了。</p>
<p>願內憂外患這雙重受難的日子，自今結束，來年快快樂樂地慶祝卅六屆國慶。</p>
<h3>卅五年前今日　往事勾沉</h3>
<p>— S．S</p>
<p>北京今日下午在琉璃厰召開國民慶祝會，</p>
<p>到會者十萬人，演唱革命新劇後，有若干靑年聚集城門外，執剪以伺，凡有髮辮者必須剪去方得入城，否則即圍毆殆死，故羣衆均默不作聲，聽其剪去，頃刻間髮辮即積成一小山，歡聲雷動。</p>
<p>上海寰球中國學生會今日舉行光復紀念會，請國父蒞臨演講，由主持人伍廷芳·李登輝。王正廷等相陪，演講畢合座三呼「中華民國萬歲，孫，孫，孫！」繼又三呼「中華民國萬歲，伍，伍，伍！」（指伍廷芳）</p>
<p>上海各界晚間舉行提燈大會時，爲挽回利權，行列中有一不吸捲烟進行會」之皮帶車一輛，上紮檯閣一座，電炬輝煌，其上扮演一人因「吃香烟」　呼，被印捕拘拿情狀，形容逼肖，頗使人觸目驚心。</p>
<p>軍民同歡</p>
<p>北平哈達門大街今日有步騎馬砲兵一萬六千名分左右排列，整日鵠立街上，莊嚴雄偉。閱操典禮時前淸喀拉沁親王及蒙藏喇嘛主敎均被邀列席，內蒙活佛衣黃袍，乘雙輪大黃車緩緩御向台前，車輪互大，而車身極高，矞麗堂皇，全塲側目。</p>
<p>上海「滬防全軍統領」李英石及「福字營」劉司令傳齊所部，每兵賞小洋一角，停操一天，以示紀念。同時法商電車公司車務總管菊黎蒙，親至西區市政廳謂國慶紀念，敝公司深表「同情」，爲顧及行人擁擠，允於日間將「快車」改駛「慢車」。</p>
<p>蘇州振市公司擬於國慶日起在城內試行人力車，詎爲中市上下塘市民公社劇烈反對，僉以街道狹窄，如通行人力車，則各店舖須拆讓三尺，萬難贊成，已聯名呈請民政長及巡警總局禁不止人力車行駛，並擬以實力作最後解決辦法。</p>
<p>溫故知新</p>
<p>民國元年雙十節，申報自由談載有短文一則，雖時過境遷，仍可一讀：「今日何日乎？乃中華民國之第一國慶日也。彩旗高樹，舉國若狂，然細察國事，誠有感於心；言內政則意見紛歧，操戈同室；言外交則列强虎視，承認無期；言財政則司農仰屋，羅掘俱窮；言軍事則消納無方，頻驚風鶴；而閭閻無愛國之意，邊疆多不軌之徒，大地瘡痍，那堪回首，前途荆棘，能不傷心，値此紀念之期，更有無窮之嘆，安能强從流俗，而爲慕燕之歡娛乎？」</p>

<h3>人民不要怕徵兵　政府應該辦得好</h3>
<p>— 黎村</p>
<p>修正兵役法已經在立法院三〇八次例會中通過了。其中規定凡中華民國男子自十八歲到四十五歲止都有服兵役的義務。爲了這件事，已經引起了許多人的恐懼和不安。互相傳遞着一要抽壯丁了」的消息！好像大禍臨頭了一樣。其實這也難怪，我們同胞的知識水準太低了。對於徵兵制度多半沒有能够了解它的意義何在。一方面是因爲徵兵是在抗戰以後才確立的一種制度，年代是太短了。而另一方面，由於東南沿海一帶很早就淪陷了，根本就沒有實行過徵兵，現在實行起來是屬於創舉的。難免有人要誤會的。何况抗戰中，最糟的是「八年役政」，所以「抽壯丁」對於一般人似乎有些談虎色變。</p>
<p>究竟爲什麽要徵兵？</p>
<p>第一，當兵是每個國民應盡的義務，尤其是在民主國家裏，國家旣屬於全體國民，那麽保衛國家的責任當然也要全體國民來擔負起來。徵兵的意義，就是呌每個國民都有保衛自己的國土的一種準備。每個國民必須先受到軍事訓練，才有保衛自己國家的能力。</p>
<p>第二，就目前的國際情勢來說：勝利雖然一年多了，但是國際間的永久和平不但沒有能够建立起來，相反的，國與國之間的鬥爭却一天比一天的顯露與擴大起來。我們固然是絕對的希望世界永久和平，但是事實吿訴我們：這種崇高的理想是不易實現的。可能在不久的將來，世界上再來一次不可避免的流血。在目前沒有自衛能力的國家是不能存在的。我們現在徵兵，決不欲侵略他人，而是用以自衛的。所以說：現在實行徵兵制度是極富有時代意義的。</p>
<p>第三，現代的戰爭，是科學的戰爭，一切兵器都是應用科學的原理。所以現代的士兵必須要有豐富的科學知識和健康的體格才合格。而我國一向是實行的募兵制，只有無其他生活技能的人才肯當兵，水準的低落是必然的。現在實行徵兵制，就是針對着這個弊點而產生的。凡能徵兵合格者，都必須是較優秀的國民。這樣說起來，當兵不僅是國民的義務，簡直可以說是優秀國民的權利了。</p>
<p>假如每個國民都能了解徵兵的意義，大槪不會再對它感到恐懼，而能對它感到興趣而踴躍的應徵。</p>
<p>不過，話說回來，從現在開始的徵兵，萬萬不可再像抗戰時期中的那樣糟不可言！</p>
<h3>殘酷惡毒　可怕的細菌戰</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>在這國際風雲極端險惡，大家都在惴惴於第三次世界大戰的不可避免時，已有人預測這未來的大戰一定是「生物學戰爭」，敏感的美國文人們，已拚命地把第三次大戰中生物學戰爭的想像，在大做其文章。</p>
<p>據本月六日報載中央社華盛頓專電：美國陸軍化學作戰兵團范威特稱：『美國已發明若干毒物，其威力超過第一次世界大戰的毒氣一千倍，來準備供給未來生物學戰爭之用。』范氏還提出警吿：『假如將來生物學戰爭果爾發生，吾人不僅必須作守勢的準備，且亦須作攻勢的準備。』道一段富有「不安性」的新聞，雖然不久前報章上也時有提及，不怎麽感到突如其來，但試閉目一想，當第三次世界大戰序幕時，交戰國利用無數殘毒的細菌，作「人爲的傳染」，一盎斯的「病菌粉」，便可毒死體重一百六十五磅的人一億八千萬，（美海軍生物作戰局對國會的報吿。）如此恐怖的數字，眞令人起「大戰再起，人類滅跡」之慨。</p>
<p>合法乎·非法乎·</p>
<p>但是生物學戰爭的解釋者們，都認爲此種戰爭並無「不法」之處，因爲「傳染病是很」自然」而「普通」的事情。』而且呢，他們還大聲疾呼：『生物學戰爭並不較刺刀肉搏來得「野蠻」。』那位范威特先生也說：『我完全不同情於提起武器人道不人道的事情，眞正不人道的是戰爭。如果你能使一種武器成爲不法，你就能使戰爭成爲不法。』「合法」與否？「野蠻」與否？且不要去說他。這裘先來叙述一些細菌武器的發明史：</p>
<p>誰都知道，德日兩國，在第二次大戰中，都曾企圖利用細菌作戰，據被俘的德國科學家許萊勃在紐倫堡法庭供稱，希特勒曾經命令戈林上將籌備細菌戰，在波蘭的波思南城設立蘭格硏究院，後因蘇軍的節節推進，已近德國邊界，硏究工作就此不能繼續進行。一九四四年的冬天，美國戰略事務室得到報吿：種國想用染有細菌的火箭攻擊，後來沒有實現。日本也曾企岡以紙氣球放入大量細菌，「贈」給美國，而結果毫無用處。</p>
<p>三年前·已研究·</p>
<p>美國在一九四三年春，在馬利蘭設立特別實騐室，從事硏究生物學戰爭，海軍部並實施「生物學戰爭綱領」。這年冬天，爲了要防止德國的利用細菌戰進製，在印第安那設立了一個互型的工廠，專來培養大量的細菌媒介物，在加里福尼亞的柏克立城，又設立了一個隱蔽的硏究實騐室。一九四四年的六月，化學作戰部受陸軍軍醫部的支持，主持這件事，並且有海軍及內務人員等的密切合作。美國曾預備在原子彈轟炸後，倘若日本還不屈服的話，就應用這些「養精蓄銳」的細菌戰士，來作最後總攻擊。</p>
<p>據目前由美國透露的消息：美國現有「毒菌工廠」五處，隨時可以使用毒菌作戰，威力遠超原子彈。細菌武器的製造，不像原子彈那樣嘛煩，任何一個麥酒廠，或一個大學實騐室中，便可從事。而所耗費用，相當「經濟」。這次戰爭期中研究細菌武器的經費，一共只在五千萬美金以下，比起原子彈的經費二千兆——眞可說是「價廉物美」。</p>
<p>究竟用生物戰來作爲進攻武器，它在戰略上的重要性是怎樣的呢？美國的權威者說是「無限」的。這地方在被襲擊時，你看不見牠們，聞不到他們，嘗不出牠們，等到你慢慢的開始懷疑時，這地方的居民已死去一大半了。一切五榖生物當然不必說。</p>
<p>·使用時·有限制</p>
<p>但是事實上，它的效用也有限度，因爲生物戰的武器是控制不住的東西，對於侵略者與被侵略者都有危險只能在不得已時用它來作「最後拼命」的武器。而且敵人不會在他本國運用生物戰，來對付一個侵略者，因爲這會使他本國有發生疫病的危險。</p>
<p>科學的進步，把人類的戰爭從原始戰爭用石器起，刀·槍·大砲·炸彈·坦克·原子彈，一直將到達「生物學戰爭」，人類的大屠殺果眞難免麼？我們是在熱烈地企求蕭，企求著這些進步的武器沒有『用武之地』！</p>

<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>「硬將」王耀武</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>有人曾經這樣說；「山東國共的兩個軍事領袖，一個是坐鎭濟南的王耀武，一個是覇佔臨沂的陳毅，他們是硬將對硬將一。</p>
<p>目前的魯省，只有兩個最完整的土地濟南與靑島，都在國軍控制之下，其餘的地方雖然一有國軍駐防，但總不能完全掌握。在這種環境之下，王耀武泰然坐鎮濟南，維持山東治安，這眞是一件吃力不討好的任務。而迄今濟南仍在國軍保護之下，人民倖免淸算，這不能不歸功於王耀武將軍，及其英勇的弟兄們。</p>
<p>關於硬將軍的身世：山東泰安是他的故鄉，從小天性好鬥，常以戰勝爲榮。因此他踏進了黃埔。抗戰八年中，他從上高打到常德，從湖南打到江西，兩次會戰都獲得了空前的大捷，而在抗戰結束前，又造成了一次「湘西大捷」。所以，每一個人都稱他爲打不垮衝不散的硬將，在最近，中國的靑年將領中，他是惹人囑目的人物了。現在，他是第二綏靖區司令官。</p>
<p>九年前，他是五十一師師長，經過這個漫長的抗戰，他由師長，軍長集團軍副總司令，集團軍總司令，方面軍司令官，一直跳到今日的綏靖區司令官。在許多戰役中，他所立的功勳，最顯著的是上高會戰，常德保衛戰，湘西大捷。這三次戰鬥的成功，充分表現他指揮的能力。凡是他的長官與部下，都有如是的批評。「胆大心細，果斷沉着」，是他唯一的特長。</p>
<p>記得他接任七十四軍軍長後，對前任軍長兪濟時，還是和過去一樣的敬崇，甚至於對一些重要的問題仍然請敎老軍長。</p>
<p>作戰制勝，有一個重要的條件；爭取友軍的援助及密切的連繫。王將軍頗懂這一點，在湘西之役，王耀武得力於其背後友軍（湯恩伯軍隊）的策應與配合，因而造成大捷。王軍將在每一戰役開始後，特別注意把他所得的軍情報吿給友軍，而在電文中或電話語調中，非常誠懇，謙虛，因此得到友軍的好感。這些都是小地方，但也就是他的成功秘訣。</p>
<p>今天，他的地位不算小，但他一點也不驕傲，待人接物非常虛心，他不會動輒以軍事機密爲藉口，來賣「新聞關子」，來顯示超越的架子。而且，對一般學者名流，社會賢達人士，他也會赤誠地請敎。正因爲如此，使對他政治認識更深刻，人們都稱他爲軍事政治全能的將領。他的生活相當嚴肅，據說在他生平中，找不出羅曼史來。</p>

<h3>「以建民國，以進大同！」</h3>
<p>— 孫科</p>
<p>祝民國三十五年雙十節</p>
<p>去年今天，剛剛是勝利後的第二個月，我曾在一篇國慶紀念文中申述下列的信念：在抗戰勝利後的第一件大事，就是和平建國。這是我們對國家對世界的責任，也是全國人民最迫切的希望。我們的建國大業，只許成功，不許失敗。預料在建國過程當中，將要遭遇到許多意外的困難，但任何困難，必須克服，任何僵局，必須打開，任何問題，必須解決。最後祗有三民主義才是解決國是的基本原則，只有人民利益才是決定國策的最大因素，這乃是我平素所保持的一貫信念。</p>
<p>今天民國三十五年的國慶節又來臨了。在此動盪不寗的國家內外現勢之下，我們正以沉重的心情迎接這一年一度的國慶。固想自國父創立民國至今，雖已過了一世紀的三分之一。但過去的國民革命工作，顯然還停留在民族主義一個階段；至於民權與民生兩大主義，到今天還沒有澈底實行，目前我們這一個多難的國家，依然在走着崎嶇險阻的道路。我們在痛心疾首之餘，不得不希望今後「革命的破壞」工作，應該到了可以結束的時候了！現在全國人民所朝夕禱祝的。便是對內要遵照國父所遺留下來的建國方案，各黨各派，同心協力，來建設一個民主統一的新國家對外要依據「聯合國　　」的原則，與各聯邦友好相處平等合作，以碓保東亞乃至世界的永久和平，這也便是三民主義的「大同世界」理想的實現。</p>
<p>基於上面的兩個希望，我深切感到今天的中國，與獨立戰爭後的美國，非常相似。那時美國剛在擺脫外力的壓迫之後，回家基礎，還很脆弱，十三州的關係，尤爲混亂後來美國政府與人民，卒能採取和平的方式，由憲法會議達到了統一建國的目標。誠然中美兩國的政治制度和政治理想，都未必完全相同，但他們這種和平建國的精神，確是値得我們效法的。</p>
<p>試放眼四看，現在國境之內，烽烟四起，滿目滄換，全國人民正陷於水深火熱之中，非但絲毫沒有享到勝利的成果，而且現在的人民所受的犧牲和損失，反在戰時之上。更爲了國內政治問題不能解決，使中國的國際地位一落千丈；同時因社會經濟的危機，與政治風氣的敗壤，以致　成了目前民生凋敝物價飛漲的現象。要想解救當前的險惡局面，只有靠大家固頭猛省，相忍爲國，來建設三民主義的現代國家，這乃是今後中國唯一的生路，如果要想建國大業能够順利完成，吏非首先完成民主與統一不可，再進一步說：爲求統一的實現就必須軍隊國家化，並停止全國性之戰爭。我們應該依照蔣主席的宣示：「政治必須用政治方式解決」以解決人民的痛苦，挽救國家的危機。爲了求民主的實現，就必須一面開始憲政，實行民權主義，踏上現代化民主國家的道路；一面改革政治，實行民生主義，澈底肅清宮僚資本，買辦階級和土豪劣紳的勢力。從今天起，一切黨派，要集中力量，在蔣主席領導之下，共同爲和平建國工作而奮鬥，這是我所敢竭誠盼望的第一點。其次從國際形勢看來，自大戰勝利以後，各大盟邦之間，因互信的缺乏，與觀念的分歧，已經失去了從前在戰時的合作精神，而釀成目下劍拔弩張的局勢。尤其美蘇兩大壁壘的形成，已是無可眸言的事實，於是第三次大戰的恐怖，又侵襲着每一個人的心頭，甚至有人認爲英美與蘇聯的衝突已有一觸即發之勢，決沒有避免的可能。更有少數好亂或盲目的份子，正在鼓吹並期待着另一大戰的發生。馴至大家對於世界和平的前途，大多抱著悲觀的心理。我以爲這種心理，這種看法，對國際和國內局勢的澄淸，都是有害無益的。</p>
<p>要知道戰後的任何盟邦，誰都渴望和平，誰都痛惡戰爭。以英美蘇三國來說，美國的政策，一向是以反侵略爲職志的英國經過大戰的創傷，實在自保不暇，更無發動大戰的力量。蘇聯在大戰以後，也是精疲力竭，正需要休義生息的機會，同時在各大盟邦之間，也並沒有什麼不可調和的矛盾，儘管在對戰敗國和領土問題的處理上，曾經發生許多歧見，儘管聯合國的前途，還須經過許多艱難曲折的道路、但我深信憑着各盟邦政治家的睿智和容忍的精神，一定可以把它逐漸克服的。至於那些盼望並鼓吹第三次大戰的人們，或許以爲大戰可以帮助我們解決國內問題，殊不知下一次大戰如果發生，就不啻命定了過半數人類生命的毀滅和文化的崩潰，任何國家決無可以行險僥倖的理由。所以我們決不希望第三次大戰發生，尤其不希望它在中國或遠東方面發生。况且我國以積弱之邦，要想在國際的矛盾中得到便宜，簡直是痴人說夢而已。還有一種錯誤的觀念好像以爲中國的外交政策，除了親美或親蘇之外，別無他途可想，這更是很可怕的一種成見，要知道我們介乎兩大友邦之間，只能以擉立自主外交的姿態，作美蘇的橋樑，而決不要使自己成爲下次大戰的導火綫，以臻整個民族陷入萬刧不復的境地。我們願以至誠，與一切盟邦平等合作，以奠定世界和平的基石。同時也盼望我們的友邦，都能開誠布公，彼此棄嫌修好，恢復戰時合作的精神，排除猜疑傾軋的心理，以求聯合國理想的澈底實現，這就是我所竭誠盼望的第二點。</p>
<p>矗立在武昌蛇山公園內之黃克强先烈銅像</p>
<h3>雙十史話</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>雙十兇專名　吳稚老所首創</p>
<p>中華民國國慶之定於十月十日，係民國元年九月廿八日參議院所議決，因武昌起義之日爲辛亥年舊暦八月十九日，依新勝適爲十月十日也。在此以前，提及辛亥革命時，尙皆以舊暦計。革命成功民國成立以後，各學校中最流行一歌曲名「革命軍歌」，其首二句謂「八月十九武昌城，起了革命軍。……」尙係指舊曆。至於「雙十節」之專名，則爲吳稚暉先生所首創者。</p>
<p>黎元洪出山　係被硬拖出來的</p>
<p>辛亥武昌起義，革命軍推黎元洪爲都督，後來鄂滬兩地革命軍爲謀號召統一計，並推黎爲大元帥，黃興副之。以後，黎元洪在民國初年的政局上，始終佔着一個極重要的地位。其實，黎當初之出山，並非自願，而是被硬拖出來的。渠於是年十月十八日致其舊上司薩鎭冰一函中，曾有自供，略謂：</p>
<p>「洪當武昌變起之時，所部各軍均已出防，空營獨守，束手無策，黨軍驅逐瑞督出城後，即牽隊來洪營，合圍搜索，洪換便衣匿室後，（編者按：一綐爲躱在床底下）常被索得，責以大義，其時槍砲環列，萬一不從，即身首異處，洪祗得權且應允，吾師素知洪最謹厚，何敢倉猝出此……」云云。</p>
<p>武昌第一槍　工程營態炳坤發出</p>
<p>武昌起義，發第一槍者究爲何人，這也是個極有趣味的問題。據總理三民主義演講集中所載，則爲工程營熊炳坤氏。但在當時，曾參加革命起事之武漢人士，自誇自己是發第一槍之「起義人」者，爲數頗多，如蘇成章·梅寳　·陳鴻誥·牟鴻勛·謝石欽等皆是，這些人打電報，發宣言，亦皆於其署名上加「起義人」三字，以資號召。這樣的人多了，不免引人生　，乃有人於震且民　換一短評議臘之，自署曰「非爬義人」。後「起義人」竟因此真狀法院控吿「非　　人」大打官司，但終無結果而罷。這也算是革命史中的一段趣話</p>
<p>總理在美　得愁武昌起義</p>
<p>辛亥革命爆發時，總理正在美國，旅行各地，向僑胞鼓吹革命，募集捐款，並爭取外國政府之同情協助。起義之次日，總理適行抵柯羅拉多州之底華城。十餘日前，在途中即曾接到黃興自香港所發一電，但因行李已先期運送此地，而密電本則置於其中，故途中無法譯出。到底華城後，即於行李中取出密電本，譯出電文，原電云：「居正自武昌到港，報吿新軍必動，請速滙款」。那時已近深夜，總理因車中旅途勞頓，十分困倦，即就寢，準備次晨設法。次日起身後，至餐廳用膳，走過迴廊報攤，即購一報携入餐廳閱讀，坐下一展報紙，即見電報一段曰：「武昌已爲革命軍占領」，方知革命業已爆發矣。</p>
<p>人心趨向革命　望平街號外多</p>
<p>武昌起義的消息傳到上海，人心異常興奮，各報（尤其是傾向革命的報紙）都大事渲染，過甚其辭，如湖南至九月一日（舊曆）方宣佈獨立，但八月廿五日上海各報已大字刋載革命軍占領湖南矣。讀報者雖明知其不可靠，但人心趨向革命，故報紙一出，立即銷罄。其時若干投機者流，即利用此種心理，在望平街頭發行一種豆腐乾式的號外，寥寥數十字，售價亦與報紙同，其消息大都爲閉門捏造者，但一經印出，亦立即一槍而空。此種號外，最多時竟達十餘種。望平街各大報館門首一帶，時常見有許多人終日得徊守候，等買號外。</p>
<p>上海之光復，係於辛亥九月十四日（舊曆），是日陳英士氏所　　之　軍攻占製　局，當日下午，軍政府即布吿安民。軍政府之組織，計陳英士爲都督，伍廷芳爲交涉總長，處洽鄉爲洋商交涉長”李平書爲民政總長，沈　雲爲財政總長，王一亭爲商務總長，李　和爲軍政府臨時司令。</p>
<p>上海光復後　發布六言韻文告示</p>
<p>上海，光復以後，軍政府發布之安民吿示，爲仿宋體字印，六言通俗韻文，云：</p>

<p>同時，尙有「上海縣司法長黃」的布吿一紙貼出，黃即黃淵之。該布吿末所署日期爲「黃帝紀元四千六百〇九年九月十八日」。</p>
<p>民國元年慶祝會　北京琉璃廠盛況空前</p>
<p>民國元年雙十節，北京慶祝大會，在琉璃廠舉行，赴會者卅餘萬人。會塲東西口皆有松花牌棋，東牌樓有四大字曰「普天同慶」，西脾樓四大字曰「萬邦協和」。琉璃廠窰爲開會地點，正中設祭壇，上置　牌，書：「中華民國爲國死事諸君靈位」。前門內外共有四大松花牌樓，門外中間之牌樓上書「於萬斯年」，東邊牌樓書「尊重人道」，西邊牌樓書「發揚國光」，門內牌樓上前面將淸隆裕太后之退位詔大書於上，其後緩四大字，曰「五族同慶」。國慶籌備會事先並曾兩請遜清皇室派員蒞會參加，其原函云：</p>
<p>「敬啓者，敝會於十月初十，十一，十二，三日舉行國慶大典，已囊各國駐京人員到會參觀，敝會不勝榮幸，茲將肅函請貴太后貴皇帝俯派代表蒞會，共　盛舉，不但斷會增無量之光榮，即五族人民，亦均受無窮之幸福矣……」云云。</p>
<p>元年雙十節，總理適在上海，是日下午，實球中國學生會舉行盛大之國慶紀念會，到來賓二千餘人，由伍廷芳博士主席並致開會詞，隨後即由總理演講，其言有云；</p>
<p>「去年今日爲武昌舉義之日，即中華民國開始第一日，其時余在美國，同志居正君有電達香港黃克强君，託余籌款助餉，余閱電文，知革命軍已得武昌，不勝忻喜。……但民國雖成立，而今尙在危險時代，內亂未靖，外出頻仍。譬之建造大厦，基礎已立，尙待建築，願吾同胞自今以後，亦須有冒險心，堅忍心，協力贊助政府，以造成地球上頭等大國，是鄙人深望於諸君者也。……」這一段話。即使到三十四年後的今日，亦仍然値得我們警惕，深思。</p>
<p>上海舉行燈會　救火聯合會發起</p>
<p>民國五年雙十節，袁世凱已死，全國又充滿了共和復活的喜氣，所以那年上海的慶祝情形，亦異常熱烈，尤其是燈會，規模浩大，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收。那天的燈會，係由上海救火聯合會所發起，自第一區至第七區各會員全體參加。下午七時，燈會出發，由淞滬警察廳騎巡隊及保安隊警士爲前導，其後爲馬隊，救火車及臺閣燈綵，凡經過之處，無不鳴爆竹歡迎，劈拍之聲，震耳欲聾。至中華路，各校學生亦臨時提燈結隊加入，萬人空巷，盛况空前。</p>

<h3>訪問兩個首義人物</h3>
<p>— 駐漢口特派員周漢動</p>
<p>——喻育之先生和李春萱先生生——</p>
<p>「秋風　　」，似乎不是沒有由來的。這兩天來，武漢陡起暴風，飛　滿天吹　，江中覆舟　劇，先後傳來六七起。記者　着社命，想去武昌找一點有關辛亥起　的史料，或訪問幾位起義的知名八物；可是輪渡整日停駛，幾次走到江千，都被暴風　　，只好「望江興嘆」！</p>
<p>爲了要達成任務，我想到用就地取材的辦法，便按照首義同志會的名單，冒着風塵的威脅，輾轉地向有關方面「鑽探」。結果：由於幾位朋友協助，竟然沙裏淘金，在倉忙的訪問中，看到了我所要訪的喩育之先生和李春萱先生，這實不能不令人喜出望外！</p>
<p>喩先生曾任鄂省財政廳長和省黨部主任委員等職（現任參政員）他的生活很簡樸記者投刺說明來意後，他便以沉着而堅毅的語調，開始談着首義的動機，經過和感想。</p>
<p>「湯武革命，順天應人；這是一句很合理的話，正和幾何學上的定理一樣，兩點之間，必有一直綫。」喻先生首先指出了革命的原理與哲學，並且不厭求詳地同記者反復地闡釋着。</p>
<p>「因爲革命不是一般的「造反」，而是時代環境的必然產物，君主時代如此，共和時代也復如是如果掛羊頭賣狗肉，就是號稱民主共和，也一定會有人來革命推翻他的。幾千年前我國就有「撫我則后，虐我則仇」的思想，何况民智大開的今天呢？先總理起來革命固然有他崇高的人格，偉大的魄力，深遠的眼光，但也因爲滿淸喪權辱國已到了窮途末路的階段，所以登高一呼，舉國風從，大家都很乾脆的唱着排滿革命，這就是順天應人的革命表現。如果當時不推翻滿淸，就無以救民族，無法講民權，更談不上甚麽民生」。</p>
<p>講到他自己參加革命的動機典經過，喩先生說：「那時我在武昌住於陸軍測繪學校，深受當時革命思潮的激動，與革命先烈犧牲精神的感召，自己又反對空談立憲，和與虎課皮的保皇黨，所以毅然置身革命，以　澈底更生之道」。</p>
<p>剪髪運動　查不出誰是首要</p>
<p>「記得辛亥年正月，我們開學之初，便發動了一個剪髮運動，先由我畫一圓圈，請大家圍着簽名。一面簽，一面剪，一夜的工夫，就把一百多個同學的辮子，一變而爲和尙頭，學校當局也無法査出誰是「戎首」。第二天，劉督辦到校大發電霆，竟謂：「吃的大者國的飯讀的大淸國的書，反要聽信邪說，去作這些反動勾當，實在辜負皇恩！」結果：各記大過一次了事。可見當時在朝者的昏膭和愚昧。而這一運動的進行，在那時侯也確够驚人了。但這只是驚人的一面，其實「山雨欲來風滿樓」，從那時起，革命的潛在力，已漸漸的充滿了整個的武漢。到晨歷中秋前後，革命的思潮，更趨於頂點，隨時有暴動的可能。我爲了準備出動，也於中秋前夕密吿家人，請勿以個人行蹤爲念。家人驚喜交集，一時滋然淚下。不免令人依依不捨！」（記者按；這裏面的劉　辦，是指當時陸軍測繪學校的校長，其所以不直書其名字者，據喩先生說：乃以示忠厚之故。）</p>
<p>秀才造反　擊石板作槍彈擊</p>
<p>首議公園內陳定一烈士就義紀念碑</p>
<p>喩先生談到這裏，神情總得特別緊張，接着便說：</p>
<p>「恰巧，在中秋節的後兩天，我們革命黨在漢口法租界寳善里的秘密機關，因爲製造炸彈失愼，而發生爆炸。孫武同志當塲被炸傷，且事機洩露，彭楚藩（鄂城人）劉復　（湖南人）楊洪勝（谷城人）等三位烈士都被捕，武陽夏三鎭頓成恐怖的現象」。</p>
<p>「十九日那天，天氣驟變，測繪同學已一律更換靑呢制服，當時的人多稱我們爲總理派來的眞革命黨。是日上午，武昌城門緊閉，學校無形停課，少數同學，並秘密在外聯絡。到了夜間，便佯作自習，齊集在自修室策應工作。當時我因性急，曾以石　擊石板作槍彈聲，並大書革命軍旗幟，擺在課室招展，有的同學都責我冒失。事後追思，的確有點荒唐；但熱血衝動，自然流露，也無法自加抑制了。不一會，果然槍砲聲馬蹄聲大作，驟聞之下，不免令人心胆爲裂。正在這個混亂喧嚷的時候，（夜間八時左右），同學代表李翊東等運來大批槍支，剛剛到達校門，就一面先開排槍不威，一面列隊發槍，準備出發。這時『秀才造反』，畢竟有點着慌，乃暗地偸飲凉水兩碗，以期略自壯膽。」</p>
<p>「出發後，我們爲策應首先發動的工程營，便向楚王台集中，就地補槍實彈。隨後，奉命把守通湖大東兩門，當夜旗兵都宸祥率部在城內作困獸鬥，都部來攻我通　門守軍時，同學劉潤生急忙拖我伏地還擊，「盲人騎　馬，夜半臨深池，」事後回憶，毛骨尙覺悚然！」</p>
<p>邀黎元洪　來負責統率軍事</p>
<p>第二天天亮，我們佔據了諮議局。這時僅遇嚴山謙一人，交出局存元寳一隻，並表示熱烈歡迎之意。我便拿了這隻白銀元寳，偕間同學傅金山去買紙寫佈吿，固至諮議局時，同學們都將窗簾布扯下，撕成片片　在左臂，作爲革命黨臨時符號。可見這時情緒的激昂與誠機了。」</p>
<p>「再後，同學們與軍隊同志邀黎元洪來府統率軍事，並組織鄂軍大都督府，推黎氏爲鄂軍大都督。我們的同學，則分在參謀部，文書部，庶務部，內務部，稽查部任事。北軍南下、局勢緊張，又成立測量部，一部分同學被派赴武漢鄰近武裝測圖，常與北軍作遭遇戰，因而陣亡的人很不少。後來武漢戰事益趨緊急，我們激於義憤，便志願加入敢死隊，手執大刀，肩荷長槍，腰橫紅帶，開到大智門劉家廟一帶，與敵作殊死戰。回憶當年情景，連我自己也覺得精神爲之一振。」喩先生一面叙說，一面以手作勢，似乎感到特別興奮而有勁。（記者按：據喩先生談：在首義之前，當時軍側有所謂三軍統，一由黎元洪統率，駐武漢；－由藍天蔚統率，駐烟台；一由應雲從（即龍翔）統率，駐河南。而黎氏所統率的，是一個混成協，編制大於現在的旅，故實力頗爲雄厚。）</p>
<p>共和告成　命同學自由先業</p>
<p>「經過幾番大小惡鬥，不久南北停戰，共和吿成，黎氏命同學至府自由選業，以示酬庸報功之意。我當時以革命是一種仗義行爲，大局雖經底定，如果獵位躁進，妄想富貴，仍是賤丈夫的行爲，非革命黨員所應有。同時又深覺自身學識，急待充實，便決定在測量局任一低級職員，利用空間，硏讀法政講議。詎意時事演變，袁氏陰謀稱帝，排斥黨人。湖口戰役起，竟有人不利於我，我便毅然離職東渡，考入日本大學，埋首硏究政治法律，以遂我求知初衷。」說到這裏，喩先生撫今思昔，似乎有些悲不自禁。他聲明他個人固已得償素願，用不着發表什麼感慨！但他看到老同志中　　不給者，大有人在，而革命遺族，流爲餓殍者也頗不乏人。尤以近八年來我同胞慘遭變亂，現雖勝利經年，而有家難歸者，仍比比皆是，因此，他最後深感自己的責任未盡，很鄭重地提出這樣一個要求與希望：「我們是執政的黨，我們是肩負建設三民主義新中國責任的人，別人殺人放火，破壞國家統一，國人自應聲罪致討。但我們不能安定社會，安定民生，以致虎兕出柙，助長禍端，我們也不能不深自警惕！爲了要慰先烈在天之靈，我們還得重新努力！」是的，喩先生是革命先進，同時現在又是國民參政員，所以他的話，處處從國計民生着眼，充分表現了一個人民代表的身份。</p>
<p>訪李春萱　年幼的首義同志</p>
<p>向喻先生辭別後，記者便去訪李春萱（即作棟）先生。他是當年首義同志中年齡最小的一個，而現在也是五十四歲的老將了。</p>
<p>走進李宅，李先生正忙着籌備雙十節擴大慶祝事宜，由於乃弟秉偉兄的介紹，他和記者談話，似乎特別親切而謙遜。</p>
<p>「關於首義的經過，我想已經有人談過，不必我再來嚕囌了。現在我願稍加說明的，是湖北陸軍特別小學與辛亥革命的關係。」</p>
<p>李先生揭開這個話題，首先强調張文襄公（之洞）在湖北的建樹。他說：「文襄公在鄂振興敎育，培植人才，的確不遺餘力；後來的革命志士，多半出其門下，如黃克强先生，張國恩先生，王世杰先生和我太人，都是兩湖師範的學生。如宋敎仁先生，田桐先生，係文院普通學生。而陸軍特別小學，更是張文襄公所手創，所有同學，什九都加入國民　，辛亥之役得力於該校同學者，實在很多。」</p>
<p>李先生指出這一小學的特點，在待遇優厚畢業後可派充排長等戰，而入學標準很數，都是由各鐵協營（軍制名）挑選優秀軍士，參加考試及格後，才能錄取收容。同時當年科舉已廢、讀覆人苦無出路，所以大半投筆從戎，以取得考入陸小的資格。唯其這樣，故當時秀才當兵的事，已是司空見慣，所謂文武合流，早已開風氣之先了。</p>
<p>陸小學生　隱然爲革命中堅</p>
<p>「特別值得稱述的，是陸小的學生，在原部驗的底　，並不開除，餉項也仍照支，早赴學校上課，晚又歸營傳播革命思想！如蔡濟民，蕭國寳，杜武庫，李繼廣等，都是該校同學，隱然爲革命中堅，號召力量極大！」李先生說。他和鄧玉麟因與　國寳李繼廣等爲至交，故得參預一切謀議，深知當時情况。</p>
<p>「還有一點，更可以證明陸小學生的被人嫉忌！就是第八鎭統制張彪　一向不喜陸小畢業生，從不加以錄用，後來張聞陸小學生參加革命，敗退漢口，便懸出賞格，說明緝獲陸小一人，即獎制錢一萬串文，可見他們的畏懼陸小學生了」。</p>
<p>另一方面，李先生說明陸小同學，出入不受任何檢査，當時宣傳革命的書籍，如揚州十日紀和猛回頭等刋物，都是從上海　部秘密寄鄂、再透過陸小同學的散發、才傳播到每一革命靑年的。就是黎元洪的出任都督、除了黎氏本人以忠厚獲得軍心外，大部分的力最，還是由於六小同學的熱誠擁戴。</p>
<p>所以，李先生的結論：「敎育是傳播革命種子的源泉、革命成功後，所有在鄂的會文正與胡文忠詞堂，都先後被銷毀，只有追念張文襄公的抱冰堂和奧略樓等建築物，則絲毫不忍加以摧殘！就是因爲文襄公興學育才之功不可抹煞！</p>
<p>至此，李先生交給記者兩張珍貴的照片，一是武昌諮議局起義時的都督府，一是總理民元來漢時各界歡迎的情形。李先生堅決地說：「辛亥革命成功，不是偶然的，這個理由要從真實的史料中去探求！」</p>

<h3>三十五年來　雙十節之歷史規跡</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>從分裂到統一，從束縛到自主，從革命到建國，它已走了一段十分悠長的準備途程，而一切的開始是在今天。</p>
<p>三十五年在一個國家的立國史上，原不算是一段很長的時聞。但三十五年來的中華民國，却是經歷了一段十分悠長，十分艱苦的途程。滿淸末年，內政腐敗，强鄰環伺，加以內求革新外爭獨立的革命運動洶湧澎湃，滿淸政府，帶着數千年封建專制的記憶，突然崩潰了，但封建思想的遺毒，却仍然依附在那批軍閥政客們的身上，新生的革命力量並朱曾把它們廓淸，以致成立未久的民國，仍然是一團糟。辛亥革命在任何一方面都不能說是澈底的，它錯以爲自己的敵人就只是那個七歲的小皇帝，却不知眞正可怕的敵人還有那批數千年專制對建所孕育出來的遺毒。因此，它在淸室覆亡，民國甫定以後，就和那批封建的勢力妥協了，這鑄下的第一個大錯，就鑲成了以後兩次的帝制之夢，和十多年的羣雄割據之局。辛亥革侖所希望的推翻專制封建的大業，其實並不曾成功於民國元年，而是成功於民國十七年。北伐的完成，才使中國眞正地解脫了封建勢力的鍊鎖，眞正地從一個四分五裂的局面漸漸走向了安定和統一。北伐的成功，是中華民族克服了它第一次嚴格的試鍊。</p>
<p>但國民革命的大業，一方面是求國內的統一革新，另一方面是在求對外的自由獨立，北伐所完成的只是前者，而日本帝國主義者，懔然於一個統一中國的强大力量，立即百般阻撓，不斷啓　，從濟南慘案到九一八，一二八，楡關熱河事件，而終至二十六年的七七事變，使中國忍無可忍，不得不以米經充分準備的國力，一睹中華民族的生死存亡。這以後的八年，歷盡了千辛萬苦，中華民族終於又戰勝敵人，在斷坦殘壁中站起了身來。如今，一百年來加在身上的不平等條約是取消了，中華民國第一次在世界上有了獨立的人格。抗戰的成功，是中華民族克服了它第二次嚴格的試鍊。</p>
<p>但我們是付下了如何巨大的代價！我們試略一回顧以上的史實，當不難看出，民國成立的三十五年來，與國內的封建勢力掙扎奮鬥者十七年，與國外的帝國主義掙扎奮鬥者又十七年，而如今；兩重的束縛雖已解除，但國家却仍然是內瀕戰亂，外受輕侮，道情形，如何不値得我們反省警惕？値茲第三十五年的雙十節，我們正可趁此機會，重頭回顧那中華民族所已度過的三十四次雙十節，當亦可沿着這條道路，順其印跡，　出一條歷史的弧線，使我們了解自己今日是站在怎樣的一個關頭，面臨着怎樣的一種道路。</p>
<p>（一）脆弱的起點</p>
<p>亥革命原是十次失敗的慘痛經歷所換來的。但淸廷退位民國成立以後，革命的力量，爲了急求成功，竟忽略了總理所諄諄訓示的勿與反革命勢力相妥協的主張，而誤認那批封建殘餘的軍閥政客眞已翻然改悟，投身革命，於是便和他們携手合作了。這批封建餘孽的代表者，自然是袁世凱。袁世凱本是淸延末年的權臣，也是代表淸廷和革命軍協談和議的主要人物，他自然絲毫不了解革命的眞義，但他生性老猾狡詐，眼見淸廷的大勢已去，便假作也主張推翻專制建立共和，好爲自己造一個天下。那時候，大家爲了希望和議成功，不惜將辛苦締造的民國交給了袁世凱。我們知道，辛亥革命的爆發，是在一九一一年十月十日。到次年二月十二日，和議就成功了，淺見者以爲淸廷的覆亡如此之連，是一件幸事，部不知道正是革命的大不幸，因爲北方封建的腐敗勢力，仍然是絲毫未動，而革命在廣大的人民之間，也並未植下深廣的基礎，（這一點直到北伐前後才眞做到）所以反革命的舊勢力，不久使又抬頭了。袁世凱雖被選爲臨時大總統，但他如何會肯離開北方自己的封建老巢，而置身於革命氣氛濃厚的南方？所以他百般推托，先則說秩序未定，難於分身；繼則製造兵變，揚言非坐鎭北京，不能確保安定。那時的參議院也中了袁氏之計，竟同意了他在北方就職。須知一個革命的首都，必須建立在一種革命的環境之中，以當時北方的烏烟瘴氣，絕難推動革命的政治，其理甚明。所以總理在那時曾堅特必須以南京爲首都，在辭職書中曾附有三項辦法，其第一條就是：「臨時政府地點，設於南京，爲各省代表所議定，不能更改。」但當時大部分的黨人竟皆不察，徒求近功，以致造成了以後四年間帝制復活的怪劇。</p>
<p>總之，民國誕生後的情景，絕不似一種革命甫吿成功時的新生氣象。相反地，革命力量未有統一的領導，紛紛擾擾，而反革命的封建勢力，則利用了道種錯綜複雜的局面，掌握着大半壁的河山。辛亥革命在中國歷史上起了一　空前的開端，但並未曾好好利用這個開端，繼承着十次革命的銳氣，貫澈到底。所以，當民國元年雙十節，企國正歡度中華民國的第一次國慶時環顧國內外的情勢，和淸廷末年的局面似仍不相上下；內則總統制與責任內閣制的權力問題爭吵不休，國務會議移於總統府，弄得國務院名存實亡，大權集於袁世凱一身；經濟上則財源枯竭，民生凋敝，惟一的辦法只是向英日借債；同時，蕪湖，洛陽，浦口，沙市等地相繼兵變，秩序不靖；而外交上，則英國正照會外交部，西藏不得改設行省。帝俄亦以俄蒙協定通吿政府，不准中國車隊入駐蒙境。——就是在這種內前外迫的情境下，中華民國度過了它風雨飄搖的週歲。</p>
<p>（二）帝制之夢</p>
<p>我們如果以民國二年到五年間的四次雙十節聯成一線，那末就正可以畫出民國史上第一幕醜劇的前前後後，袁世凱，在自己的窠裏穩穩地做成了總統以後，無時不在想做皇帝。尤其是宋敎仁被刺，江南諸督如陳英士，黃興，李烈鈞等的討袁軍(即歷史上的所謂二次革命）俱吿失敗以後，袁的氣焰更張，長江一帶，亦悉數入了北洋軍閥的勢力範圍。民國二年十月六日，國會選舉正式大總統，袁世凱陰唆黨羽，假借民意，包圍議院，因而當選</p>
<p>是年雙十節，袁在北京故宮太和殿正式就職，典禮畢，百官還曾「三呼萬歲」，事後在武英殿接見淸室代表，並曾發表談話，謂「十分感謝大淸皇帝的祝賀之忱」云云，眞使人弄不明白此時是民國還是淸朝。袁世凱的就任大總統。本已代表着革命力量的挫折，和反動勢力的囂張，所以不久，他就解散國會，毀棄約法，帝制的醞釀日見顯著。他底下那批帮閒食客之徒，竭力奉迎慫恿，而如楊度劉師培諸人，則又高唱所謂「君戀救國論」，鼓吹着什麼「共和不適國情」的怪論。那時候歐戰已起，日本軍佔據了濟南車站和膠濟沿綫。民國三年的雙十節，各報上所登載的盡是一片外交部的抗議和日軍的進佔情形，把國慶的情緒，弄得十分　凉　淡。</p>
<p>民國四年八月，楊度等的籌安會成立了，袁世凱的陰謀，至此已是路人皆知。雙十節前後「國體變更」的流言，已遍及各地，袁並製造民意，陰嗾梁士飴等組織所謂「全國請願聯合會」，甚有所謂乞丐請願團，妓女請願團者，五花八門，無奇不有。又恐雙十國　或將引起人民的共和之思，所以假時局不靖爲名，竟令全國「屆時槪免舖張」，暫停慶祝。於是，中華民國的第四個國慶，竟只在悲憤的寂靜中悄悄度渦了。</p>
<p>十月，所謂「國民代表大會組織法」公布了，在楊度梁士飴等的操縱之下，選出了代表一千九百九十三人，自然，全體一致主張君憲，推袁世凱爲皇帝。袁亦下令正式承認接受帝位，改元洪憲，正式籌備登極。</p>
<p>但封建的舊勢力，畢竟抵不住革命向上的洪流。總理見袁的野心已露，乃命胡漢民許崇智等分赴南洋籌款舉義，陳英士則在滬主持。肇和艦首先揭起了討這的旗熾，結果雖不幸失敗，但不久蔡鍔唐繼堯等所領導的護國軍即在雲南起義，向川桂邊境進展。廣西，廣東，陝西，四川，湖南等省亦先後響應，宣佈獨立。袁見大勢已去，還想取消帝制，保留自己總統的地盤，但爲護國軍所嚴辭拒絕。袁羞憤交加，終於在民國五年六月六日　　病死於新華宮，各省乃先後取消獨立，總算未曾大動干戈，使生靈再受塗炭。</p>
<p>袁世凱浪費了中華民國五個年頭的歷史，他的一生，只做了一件好的事情，就是：他很適時地死了。</p>
<p>（三）黑暗中的光明</p>
<p>但袁世凱的死並不就是一切封建殘餘的滅亡。從民國五年六月袁世凱病死，到十五年七月廣州誓師北伐這整整十年間，民國的歷史，是度過了一個十分黑暗的時期。我們可以用幾句話先簡括地描出當時的一幅圖畫：政客爲了爭權奪利，各自成羣結黨，互相傾軋，政治成了他們自己的私產；軍閥覇住了地盤，動不動就是「獨立」·這其間鬧了復辟，鬧了賄選，一團稀糟，在這種情境之下，所僅存的一點浩然正氣，就只是總理所領導下的南方的革命力量。</p>
<p>這一段時期中北方政局的此起彼落，以及直皖直率等軍閥的爭　混戰，今日看來已不重要，可不詳論。但有一點必須指出，即在這十年的政客　　軍閥混戰之中，革命的力量亦已鍛鍊得更堅實，更有力。這裏，我們只須　顧一下　總理在這十年間所努力的方向，即可從側面了解當時政局的背景，以及革命力量的準備過程，這對於後來北伐的成功，是有着極重大的影響的。</p>
<p>自民國六年張動復辟，國會解散以後，議員紛紛南下，羣集廣州，開非常國會，舉總理爲大元帥，成立南方軍政府，以與北方的惡勢力相對抗。總理原意，本欲統一南方的力量，以爲革命救國的陣營，但不幸一部分的地方將領，都還是存着腐敗的地盤觀念，對於總理的計劃，陽奉陰違，甚至朝是暮非，多方製肘。總理看了這種情形，深感革命的成功，尙非一蹴可達，必須一方面使革命的理論深入入心，樹立廣大的基礎，另一方面確立建國的具體方略，以爲立國工作的準繩，如此，革命方能够澈底成功。那時，軍政府已爲岑春喧陸榮廷等所把持，總理有鑒於此，便毅然辭職離開廣州，赴滬從事著述，撰成「孫文學說」及「建國方略」二書，成爲國民革命的指導思想。</p>
<p>十年，總理重返廣州，就任非常大總統，積極準備北伐。但由於陳烱明的突然叛變，總理的計劃又吿失敗。十二年，曹錕賄選總統，由吳景濂等包辦以鉅款收買議員，每票五千元。十月五日大選之日，議具來投票拿錢者異常踴躍，據當時報戲，甚至有臥病在床，亦輿榻入內投票者。於是曹錕就在道批「五千元議員」的推戴下被選爲中華民國的大總統。</p>
<p>十二年的雙十節眞是民國史上的恥辱。因爲在這一天，以五千元一票選出來的曹錕，正式入京就任大總統。總理在廣州立刻通電全國，討伐曹銀·同時，爲了培養革命的軍事力量，命令總裁籌備陸軍軍官學校於黃埔；並爲加强革命的組織，於十三年一月改組國民黨，在廣州召開第一次全國代表大會。總理於開會詞中曾闡述自己的希望：「此次國民黨改組，第一是要組織一個有力量而且具體的政黨；第二是用政黨的力量去改造國家」。會後並發表宣言，闡釋三民主義的對內對外政策。後來北伐的成功，多半得力於黃埔的軍事力量；而北伐成功的所以能如此之速，則全倚黨的有力的領導，和主義的深人人心。總理現下了成功的種子，但不及親見它的開花結實，便流然長逝了，可是這黑暗裏的一線曙光，却正帶來了黎明的光耀。</p>
<p>（四）從分裂到統一</p>
<p>民國成立已十五年了，但一切仍然是一種亂紛紛的局面。十五年，總理逝世之次年，七月，南方的軍事形勢大定，今總裁乃決定繼承總理的造志，率師北伐，打倒軍閥，以貫澈國民革命的主張，建立三民主義的中國。那時候，除了廣東一隅而外，中原牛壁尤其是北方，完全是在軍閥的盤據之下，人民痛苦，日益加深。北伐軍明知軍閥的兵力要比自己多四五倍，而武器財力，尤佔優勢，但爲了革命的眞正成功，毅然於十五年七月九日在廣州誓師出發。</p>
<p>北伐軍出發以後，所向披靡，這一方面是因爲革命的武力畢竟是有目標有理想的，士氣之盛，絕非軍閥奴役驅使下的兵卒所能比擬；而另一方面，革命的思想當時已深入人心，北伐軍到處，人民眞是無不簞食壺漿，歡呼夾道。因此不二年而全國統一。這一段經過，我們就可以十五至十七年間三次雙十節前後的情勢作爲基點，分別回溯這一段時期中北伐軍的進展。</p>
<p>十五年雙十節：北伐軍自粤出發後，不久即攻入湖南。吳佩孚率兵南下，遂發生汀泗橋，金口及紙坊三次大戰，吳軍節節敗退，退守武昌。北伐軍三次總攻，冒極大犧牲，終於雙十節日攻下武昌，中部旣定，聲勢大振。</p>
<p>十六年雙十節：兩湖旣下，孫傳芳吳佩孚退保江西。北伐軍步步進迫，佔領九江南昌。同時，何應欽部第一軍由潮梅東進，平定福建。白崇禧亦率部入浙。攻入杭州，並克復上海，進逼南京。雨花臺一役，戰況空前激　，北伐軍　勇猛攻，南京亦告克復，江南戰事，至此吿一結束。六月，今總裁親率師攻入俆州。山西閻錫山亦誓師討奉。十六年雙十節時，石家莊爲奉軍佔領北進之勢，略遭頓挫。</p>
<p>十七年雙十節：四月中，今總裁對　魯軍全綫下總攻令。北伐車於津浦沿綫節節勝利，攻入濟南，今總裁並親赴石家莊督師，不久，張家口保定相繼克復，奉軍主帥張作霖見大勢已去，遂於六月三日出關，但次日即爲日人陰謀炸死於皇姑屯。東北自動易　，全國統一，北伐成功，民國成立的十七年來，惟這一年的雙十節，初次看見了一個統一中國的雛形，顯示出了十七年來從來未有的光明。</p>
<p>（五）忍辱負重的九年</p>
<p>北伐旣吿成功，軍閥絕跡，全國統一了，第一階段的立國工作，至此完成。國民政府以爲國家旣已從分裂而統一，則接着富即可從破壞而臻於建設，開始那辛亥革命以來所屢遭阻折而迄未開始的建國工作。十七年北伐成功，今總裁在西山總理靈前吿祭之月，即曾以八事自矢，其第一件即謂：</p>
<p>「破壞以後，亟待建設，我總理遺著之建國大綱建國方略，對於程序節目，早有顯明之規定，祗須全體同志篤信力行，即不難建設三民主義之新國家，以竟國民革命之全功。」</p>
<p>所以自十七年至二十六年全面抗戰開始這九年間，國民政府的目標，就是想把這飽經兵變一團亂麻的國家整理出一個頭緒，然後埋頭建設，充實國力，使這個國家的的確確能有此力量，內期統一革新，外求自由獨立。在這個目標之下，十七年起，先後舉行了全國敎育，經濟，財政，交通，禁烟等會議及最高軍事會議，積極進行軍隊的編這和一切建國大計的籌劃。是年雙十節，今總裁就任國民政府主席，新成立的五院院長亦同時宣誓就職。政府並發表施政宣言，昭示裁兵節餉，整理財政，從事生產，訓練人民行使民權，推行地方自治，改良稅收，統一貨　，發展　　，建國的大計雖千頭萬緒，但至此巳都略具規模，十七年的　十節，全國正充滿着一種　　的新生氣象。</p>
<p>不過，好幾年來所　伏着的一個內部的問題，亦於此時日見顯露。早在　總理在　之日，爲了想集中國內的力量，爲掃蕩軍閥的勢力而奮鬥，所以宣佈啓共，允許共產黨員以個人資格加入中國國民黨，其時總理與越飛的聯合宣言中，亦曾聲明共產主義不適宜於中國，但北伐成功前後，國民黨中的共產黨員就漸漸地離開了三民主義的陣營，重又國到自己階級獨裁和沒收土地的舊政策上去，並且在江四瑞金　立了自己獨立的政權和軍事系統，在甫具統一雛形的國家內建立了另一個政府，這結果，就釀成了以後數年間不幸的戰　，損傷了國家多少元氣，最後，這一劃據勢力雖然是不得不離開了一片怨聲載道的江西，而「二萬五千哩長征」到不毛之地的陝北，去建立另一個獨立的政權，但這一個未決的問題，直到全面抗戰開始，始終成了國家政治和國防建設上的隱憂。</p>
<p>在另一方面，日本帝國主義者，眼見着一個强大的中國就要形成，便想盡了各種方法來阻梗，破壞。「五三慘案」以後，有「萬寶山事件」，「中村事件」，這就成了九一八事變的藉口。日本想囊括東北，攫取這一片廣大平原上的資源，以爲併吞中國及併吞整個亞洲的張本，這種陰謀，由來巳久。到廿年夏天，日本人先唆使朝鮮農民在長春附近的萬寶山村，强佔中國農民的稻田，並且挖掘溝渠，淹沒了許多田地，中國農民起來反抗，日軍竟用機槍掃射。事件發生後，日本人反煽動朝鮮人仇殺華僑·八月中，更藉口中村大尉的失蹤，造成了劍拔弩張的空氣。到九月十八日夜間，便正式出兵襲佔瀋陽，東北軍事當局因爲事起倉卒，未加抵抗，以便能以談判方式進行交涉，但日軍節節推進，至二十一日即佔了吉林全省。政府爲了軍事力量的準備未充，加以國內又値空前的長江大水災，經濟上十分困竭，所以不得不忍辱負重，只作局部性的抵抗·二十年的雙十釐，「　　」的陰影　軍着每個人的眉尖，在那天的國慶紀念會中，學校的學生們大都　着　　「國難」兩個大黑字的　紗，在紀念中含着沉痛的警惕，到十一月，黑龍江全省亦吿淪陷。</p>
<p>但日本人對於我們建設的阻礙，並不以此爲已足，它的目標，是　使我們永無喘息準備的機會，所以，「九一八」以後，又　「一二八」之役，楡關之役，　河之役，長城之役，而終至七七變起，使中國迫不得已，只好　時地放棄了建國工作的進行，來從事民族存亡的決戰。</p>
<p>至此中華民國又走入了它立國的第二個階段。這階段的工作和第一個一樣的艱苦，但結果也是一樣的光明。</p>
<p>（六）從抗戰到勝利</p>
<p>這八年間的歷史。每個人都是身受其痛，記憶猶新。當不必重頭叙述。這一塲艱苦搏鬥的過程，如果以三次雙十節來作爲界綫，那末就正可以分成三個演進的階段。第一個階段，是從七七全面抗戰開始，到二十七年雙十節前後的武漢撤退。在這段時期中，我軍以十分劣勢的兵力單獨奮鬥，雖然放棄了南京，放棄了徐州，也放棄了武漢，但一路上消耗敵人，步步爲營，打破了敵人速戰速決的迷夢。第二個階段，是從二十七年雙十節到三十年雙十節前後的宜昌撤退，在這段時期中，我們的抗戰已更趨艱苦，物資豐饒的省分已大部淪陷，海口封鎖，交通阻　，但我們仍不屈不撓，遵奉着最高統帥的戰略，以空間像取時間，並發動大規模的敵後戰鬥，膠着敵人的兵力。在這個階段的末期，即三十年雙十節前後，宜昌亦吿失守，但不久，太平洋上的世界大戰即吿爆發。使我們的抗戰，與全世界的反侵略力量戰成了一個陣綫。第三個階段，就是三十年以後，到三十四年抗戰勝利後第一個舉國歡騰的雙十節，在這段時期內，敵人的力量日見削弱，中國，配合着同盟國家的力量，節節反攻，而終使敵人屈膝投降。</p>
<p>這八年間，大後方的軍民，在敵人的瘋狂轟炸與極度困苦的物資條件之下，咬緊牙關，堅苦奮鬥，記着大軍事學家蔣百里先生生前的名言：「勝也好，敗也好，就是不要與他講和。」而淪陷區的同胞，在敵人的壓迫凌辱之下，含辛茹苦，始終心　着受難的祖國，眞是所謂「西望王師又一年」。在他們這種共同的努力之下，敵人終於是投降了。中華民族洗雪了它歷史的恥辱，三百年來第一次地，獲得了眞正的自由獨立。</p>
<p>但這不是一切的終結，相反地，這只是一切的開始。一個國家立國的目標應該是在安定，建設，但內部的軍閥阻礙了我們十七年，外面的帝國主義者又阻礙了我們十七年。靠了三十四年來的辛苦奮鬥，今天，一切的障礙都已淸除，我們再也不應該等待，延擱了。在這三十五年的雙十節，我們更應該認淸遝一個歷史的事實，深自警惕。國家要求統一，安定，和平，建設，一切和這目標相背的動亂和破壞，都不會被四萬萬五千萬人民所容忍，原諒的。</p>
<p>三十五年來，從分裂到統一，從束縛到自主，從革命到建國，它已走了一段十分冗長的準備途程，而一切的開始是在今天。</p>

<h3>我對國是的意見</h3>
<p>— 司徒美堂</p>
<p>中華民國成立，自辛亥武昌起義，迄至今年雙十節，恰是三十五年。若從敵人投降，河山光復之後，此是第二屆之雙十節。去年雙十節，我在美國，今年雙十節，則在祖國。今天發表文字，則爲歸國以後之第一次。</p>
<p>溯自民國成立以前，吾人在海外從事革命運動，以洪門華僑團體之基礎，一本二百餘年民族革命之精神，努力奮鬥，百折不撓，於辛亥十月十日，武昌起義之先，三月廿九日廣州起義，即歷史上最有名之黃花崗之役。斯役也，舉凡籌餉責任，幾盡爲我美洲洪門所祖負，英屬加拿大嘗抵押三個埠之致公堂樓宇，變產以供給革命志士，所以中山先生常謂「華僑爲革命之母」，實指洪門華僑而言也。即中山先生從美返國就南京臨時總統之川資，亦是我個人集合同志爲之資助，始能成行，故在三十五年復慶祝雙十節之今天，緬懷辛亥革命之事實，確是不勝感慨！</p>
<p>民國成立以後，吾人遠在海外，懷抱熱望，以爲民族革命已吿成功，中華民國五族共和，實行民主，使我即國成爲民治。民有·民享之新國家，富强可待，絕無疑焉；故當時洪門華僑，俠義爲恢，忠誠救國，人人皆抱功成身退之理想，不肯過問祖國政治。詎知後來演出洪憲之　國，張勳之復辟，北洋軍閥之軍橫，爭城爭地，內戰頻仍，國將不國，吾人在外，至感失望；故對於每次救國運動，依然出財出力，對於最後國民黨之領導北伐，吾人更抱無窮之期望，以爲國家統一，至有望焉。詎知後來更演出黨內之鬥爭，兄弟鬩牆，操戈同室，年年內戰，卒至釀成外侮而發生「九一八」之瀋陽事變，吾人寄身海外，感懷祖國，痛不可言。於是一致奮起救亡，提倡團結禦侮，極力主張抗戰，處處成立抗日救國會，以爲祖國抗戰之後盾。素稱革命之洪門華僑，對於抗戰努力，更盡最大之貢獻。是以七七事變、全面戰幕揭開之後，奔走呼號，尤努力焉。即以我個人而論，除提倡捐款外，並加緊洪門團結，統一美洲各國洪門努力機關，加强組織，貢獻一切力量於抗戰。我於一九四一年，且奉命回國，向抗戰最高當局致敬，及慰問傷難。此一行也，甫及返抵國門，正在香港將已淪陷之時，因挺身而出，集合香港洪門兄弟，爲守軍之助，所以敵入香港，我便被捕，幾於斯役犧牲老命耳。又豈知尙獲覩祖國錦繡河山之光復，今天仍能在文字上與我全國同胞祖見哉。</p>
<p>際茲河山光復，我秉承美洲海外洪門革命團體之使命，返國組黨，正當還政於民，實行民主政治高唱出雲之時，凡我僑胞，皆爲祖國，已在四大强國之列，發奮圖强，及時貢獻於祖國，實屬千載一時之機會。老身愚邁，亦以爲亦然。豈知歸國五個月，所目覩者，盡是貪汚，民不聊生，外貨充斥貨塲，工業復興，絕無希望，商業凋零，經濟破產，金融崩潰，誠不知何以　國也。況乎國共爭。方與未艾，政治協商會議之議決，衋皆食言而肥，大好神州，鯨食未曾亡國，今則反因魚爛而必趨於滅亡矣。八旬老人，身歷革命抗戰，幾以身殉，正以爲祖國之當强有望，何期竟目覩祖國及有魚爛而亡之今日。心所謂危，不得不爲我同胞痛切言之，謂爲我之愚見也可，謂爲我國是之意見亦無不可。用特舉要，括陳於后：</p>
<p>(一）國共兩黨立刻停止內戰，關於國共兩黨聯合抗戰之時，舉儿海外僑胞，莫不額手慶幸，及至國共磨擦新四軍事件發生之時，海外聞之，莫不焦急萬分，我在於新四軍事件時，經已代表海外洪門華僑，力勸雙方，不料人微言輕，不足以齊禍於未然，卒使敵人納降之後，弄成內戰，仍須友邦出頭調停。數月以來，毫無結果，煮豆燃箕，言之痛心，我以爲今天之國是，要以國共雙方停止內戰爲第一條件。</p>
<p>（二）召開國民大會，製定憲法。關於政府召問國民大會，還政於民之諾言，業經昭吿天下不知若干次矣，畢竟於何年何日，然後實踐諾言，此爲舉世之所屬目者也。本來民國成立迄今，三十五年之久，國家太法，尙無確定，上無道揆，下無法守，國政紛亂，實擊蓋基於此。今爲撥亂反治計，祇有迅速召開國大會議，獲定　政，奠立當年基礎。但國家大法，並非一黨一派或一人可得而私，務須有代表全民之政府，主持其事不可。故此召開國大會讓議之先，尤在於取得全國各然各派及全民之眞正代表不可，故我以爲今天之國是，要以召開國大會議製定民主憲法爲第二條件。</p>
<p>（三）實行民治促進世界和平，關於目前戰後之世界，英美與蘇聯互相對峙，主義制度兩不相同，國際衝突，不祇足以引起世界第三次之大戰，尤可以形成我國之分裂。故爲中國目前計，非實行民主政治，沒由團結統一，而世界和平，亦非中國統一不能促進。吾人久處海外，熟識國際形勢，今茲目覩國情，更知非如是不足以挽救勢將分裂之中國，故我以爲今天之國是，要以實行民治促進世界和平爲第三條件。</p>
<p>上舉三者，不過犖犖大端。至於救國綱領，另有我最近發起之中國洪門民治黨宣言，詳明分析。對與不對，尙祈舉國賢達，公開討論，共同硏究，八旬老人，祇有默祝中華民國之和平統一，實現民主政治，日臻電強，毋負革命與抗戰之初心。如此而已，豈有他哉！</p>
<h3>上海市工務局　一年來之特殊工作</h3>
<p>— 趙祖康</p>
<p>工務局職業之事項，大別可分爲八類，即道路，橋樑，溝渠，河道，碼頭，堤塘，房屋，園塲是也。一年以來，對於此八類工程，均有相當之建設，而其性質特殊，足資記述者，厥有三項：（一）開展防汎工程；（二）搶修浦東海塘；（三）興建市民住宅。茲將此三項特殊工作，略記於後，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>一，開展防汛工程</p>
<p>本市水患原因：（一）溝渠系統紊亂，溝渠尺寸過小；（二）市內大多數區域，平地高度在最高潮水位綫下，潮水有倒灌現象；（三）雨水溝管出口處之河道，自經長期淤塞，河牀升高，疏濬伊始，雨水無法宣洩；（四）「格利」或河浜被垃圾倒入，以致淤塞。有此四因，故本局年來對於防汎工作，即採用下列原則：（一）疏濬河浜，以利宣洩；（二）疏通　管，出淸「格利」，以防積滯；（三）改建並放大瓶頸式溝管，以暢水流；（四）修建潮門閘壩及唧站，以防潮水倒灌。經一年來積極工作，至最近期間，每當大雨高潮時間，大部份低窪之地或積水容量較少或積水時期較短，不可不謂防汎工作之局部成就也。</p>
<p>二，搶修浦東海塘</p>
<p>本市塘工位在浦東者日東塘，自黃浦江口起至川沙縣之黃家灣止，全長計十五公里。歷年未加修葺，致有缺口多處，危險異常，經本局於去年冬組織海塘工程隊實地測勘，擬具整修計劃，先就海濱浴塲以南張家宅，戴家宅，鄒家宅·殷陸家宅等處決口，加以搶修，全長計一千三百五十二公尺。設計大要係以混凝土擋土牆爲塘之主要部份，墻外有堆石護坡坡脚有排椿椿外再略堆石塊，牆內再設向上傾斜之護坡，坡頂爲土堤。此項塘工於五月中開始採辦料具，於七月中旬開工，於十日前擋土牆竣工，九月　完成。最近農曆九月初三，颶風高潮同時衝擊海塘，堤工無恙，同慶安謐，至海濱浴塲以北，原無缺口，但八年來冲毀之段落，則較海塘浴塲以南爲更長，現亦已開始準備興修涙。</p>
<p>三，興建民住宅</p>
<p>本市房荒情形，極爲嚴重。本局接收之始，即注意於原有平民村之修復及新市民住宅之籌建，最初原擬修建住宅三千幢，以爲提倡，後以市庫支絀，不得已變更計劃，擬在南市閘北各建市民住宅一百六十幢，嗣又以限於不能一次籌款，不得不再行縮减，遂於南市大木橋路，先行興　市民村一所，建築住宅一百五十四幢及附屬公共設備等等，於六月間動工，八月間正屋完成，現正添置水電設備，本月內可全部吿竣。並由本市興業信任社，主持出售，仿照以往租地造屋辦法，期以二十年正式公吿登記出售，即將舉辦，市民中來函聲請者已甚多，外傳「富者不要，貧者買不起」，並非事實。蓋就公敎人員而驗，則或不免有此感想，至其他經濟情况較好之民衆，則對此建築似頗多顧價購者。無論如何，可爲救濟房荒之助。再近聞中央擬對於京滬兩市公敎人員，另行指撥專款，興建住宅，以費救濟，是亦本市房荒聲中之霜晉也。</p>
<h3>教育上的三件大事</h3>
<p>— 杭立武</p>
<p>戰事勝利結束後，蔣主席便强調地提出敎育第一的口號，的確，敎育是建國的基礎，而此基礎的奠立，實千頭萬緒。常現在百廢待興萬端待舉的時候，有三件大事，是我們在三五年中的急務，須努力儘先的去促成的。</p>
<p>第一，是充實各級學校及研究機關的儀器圖書的設備</p>
<p>我常說，從國民政府奠都南京到二十六年中日戰爭，這十個年頭，是我國從事新敎育的一個黃金時代，但不幸日本不讓我們這樣建設下去，戰爭期間各級學校的程度，因爲受設備，經濟與戰事驚擾等影饗，無諱言的是降低了，現在敎育復員，自然要以提高各級敎育的素質爲目標，要達到這目標，最重要的基本條件，就是設備，假如學校沒有充分的儀論圖書等設備，如何能提高他的敎學程度和了解能力？假如硏究機關沒有充分的設備，如何能推進硏究促成科學的進步？所以敎育復員，第一須充實設備。</p>
<p>第二，是掃除文盲推行義教</p>
<p>敎育發達的國家，如美國等，現正盛行提倡所謂敎育爲民主的遝動，在我們敎育落後、政治走向民主的國家，這種運動更是迫切的需要，所謂敎育爲民主，就是以敎育來訓練養成民主國家的公民，以保證政治的民主，充分發揮民主的精神，這的確是民主政治的基本工作，不過，這種敎育不僅是使人民認識幾個字，還要給他們生產的技能和自治的經濟等訓練。</p>
<p>第三，是科學化運動</p>
<p>就是使科學的興趣和知識普遍化，我們如要工業發達，農業改進，最基本的工作，便是將科學興趣和知識灌輸鄕村，使牠深深地滲透於一般民衆，我雖不是研究自然科學的人，但我很願意努力促進這種運動，更希望國內的科學界，共同負起這艱巨的責任，利用文字和語言，利用電影和廣播，利用圖畫和活動的模型，利用各種方法和工具，來推行科學化運動，這是需要大衆的努力。</p>
<p>最後，我還有一點小小的意見，便是敎育的事，大家都有責任，應發動大衆的力量，運用大衆的智慧，利用大衆的心力和體力，來加强敎育的效力，促成敎育的後果，若干年來，社會上養成一種不健全的風氣，差不多事事希望或責成政府去做，要知政府不能樣樣去做，的確做也做不了這許多，何况更受人力財力和時間的限制，敎育的事業是利國利民，利人利己，希望社會上能發揮最大力量，担負部分的責任，建議政府改善敎育，協助政府推進敎育，這樣，上述的三件大事，都可有很大的影響和效果。</p>
<h3>活動土地金融必先履行登記</h3>
<p>— 祝平</p>
<p>本市自清季開埠以來　中外人民集居，人口增多，工商繁盛，地價昂貴。其最大數量之資金，非黃金美鈔，乃爲地產，設以如是鉅大地產價値，加以運用，從事於生產建設，其有助於工商業之發展，市面之繁榮，無待贅言。但是重要前提，則在必先完成土地登記，使其業權確實，信用堅固，以便權利移轉，或設定負担。故土地登記與本市工商業之發展，實有密切之關聯，本市土地登記，肇始於民國十六年，至二十六年已完成一小部份，乃因全面抗戰而中止。淪陷以後，敵僞竊據，致地籍益加紊亂。迄於去秋日敵投降，還我故土，收復之初，百廢待興，而淸理地權，實爲百務之急，爰就本市最重要之黃浦·滬南·閘北·引翔·法華·漕涇·六個區域，先行依法辦理總登記，計自去年十一月開辦以來，已十閱月，初則業戶對於手續方面，不無感覺太繁，後經依據(一）簡化手續（二）縮短辦理時間，(三）節省業務勞錢(四）嚴禁需索四項原則，力求改進，業務遂見開展，現以登記期限，未便久延，爰定十月底正式截止，以便告一段落，屆時業主如再不履行登記而又不聲明正當理由者，將一律以無主土地論，依法予以處理。此乃依照法合規定，必有之程序也。</p>
<p>本市在前租界時期，一般人士，多以道契業權確實，樂於交易。實屬由於過份信任外人心理上之錯覺。蓋道契戶地不符，何能謂爲業權確實？且以權操外人，產權缺乏保證，而利權外溢，尤屬國家莫大之損失，故本市此次辦理土地登記，同時清理道契土地，凡實際產　已移轉於國人者，即以實際權利人爲所有權人，以免再受制外人，損害國人權益，惟本市地籍承百年租界特殊狀態之後，復經八載淪陷，其混亂之情形概可想見，此時加以總淸理，其工作艱繁，匪言可喩，所冀全體市民通力協作，共觀厥成，則本市土地金融之活躍，建設事業之猛進，胥於此卜之矣。</p>
<h3>保定動態</h3>
<p>— 本報九月四日訊　特約記者楊炳森</p>
<p>自北平踏上平漢車，四個小時便可到達河北的省會保定。這一座方圓僅有五公里，人口不滿十二萬的古城，在全國說來，恐怕是最小的省城了。</p>
<p>斜穿着的平漢鐵路，與貫通津保間的大淸河，是牠的兩條大動脈，掌握着全省政治，文化，軍事的總樞紐。</p>
<p>抗戰初起，這裏首遭淪陷，經過了敵人八年鐵蹄下的掙扎，刧後的保陽，一切都呈顯着不景氣，恐懼，麻痺，緊張，更好像是一個在黑暗裏剛逃出來的蟲，慢慢的向光明處　動。</p>
<p>麻痺的教育</p>
<p>保定是河北省的敎育中心，就全國省的單位而言，敎育的發達僅次於江蘇，抗戰前高等學校設有省立河北農醫兩學院。中等學校有育德。同仁，培德，民生，志存，保中，工職，男女師範等學校，此外公私立小學達五十餘校。但在淪陷期間，經敵人的摧殘，遭受到空前的厄運，有的學校被敵人改造了營房，傷兵醫院，及住宅，或竟被拆毀充佔燃燒木料，殘破之甚，不忍聞睹。勝利後各學校均積極復校，目前除接收了僞師範專科學校繼續辦理外，保中，男女師範，育德，同仁，都已先後復校，農醫兩學院也定本年暑期後開課。</p>
<p>但各復員的學校，因爲經費的關係，都是勉勉強強的開辦，設備極缺乏，尤其是一般需要實騐的理科儀器。有的學校一件也沒有，敎師們只好嘴說，筆畫，學生們也只好隨看，隨聽，分子式，二　化炭等名詞往往會鬧的莫明其妙。</p>
<p>公敎人員的淸苦，是全國普遍的現象，尤其是在保定更是苦中苦，私立學校的老夫子，月人祇有五六萬元，一人的生活尙不能維持，那有餘力來勤勉的敎導學子，價低當然買不到好貨，所以好的敎員在保定是難聘到的。因了待遇的菲薄，這裏執敎鞭的先生們，在本年五月之閒，也曾伴隨着申·平·等地，演過一次罷敎的悲劇。</p>
<p>省府遷治後</p>
<p>冀省府由平遷保的消息傳到保定後，市內每一個角落裏，都充滿了生氣，猶如給這些生活在緊張情緒下的十萬人，打了一針興奮劑，自五月一直「遷保」「遷保」的喊了兩個月，始終因辦公房舍，及職員宿舍不數應用，遲遲不來，故首批來保的人員，只勘查房址及調查官私逆產，就耗費了一個月的工夫，才陸續的在七月中旬完全遷到保定。</p>
<p>一切事情的變化，大多是不能預料的。保定的市民們，企盼着省府遷保後，想象由於人口加多，消耗增加，而驅使市面繁榮；但公務員所入有限，公家和私人都普遍的在閙窮，那裏有餘力來揮霍消耗，所以市面上仍舊是死氣沉沉的，閙了一塲空歡喜。</p>
<p>更想不到壞的空氣吹到了這些省府公務人員的身上，激起了一層不平的聲浪：</p>
<p>省府職員在北平的待遇是依照中央規定之平津區待遇支給的。移到了保定後，不但環境上的事受低了一等，薪給也改成了冀省區待遇，與平津待遇，相差了一百八十倍，一個普通職負就少收入了七八萬元。實際上保定的物價並不比平津低，除了食糧一項稍爲便宜外，一般生活必需品均高出三分之一以上，職員們當然不平則鳴，故全體聯合推選代表致電中樞，希將待遇合理調整，並尙預定派代表赴首都一行。</p>
<p>保定的市民們，對省府來保的心情，現在是淡淡的，但惟一的安慰，是因着省府移治，治安隨着加强，减少了一層威脅！</p>
<p>一直到今天的保定治安，總是波動着。一度好，一度壞，離開保定城二三十里以外，仍然是「解放區」，共軍對保定惟一的拿手戲，當然是物資封鎖，所以城內的居民，時常感到食糧缺乏，和糧價的壓迫。</p>
<h3>津門之秋</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>九月十四日天津航汛　本報特約記者李紹林</p>
<p>秋，無聲無息的走來，也無聲無息的走去，那亮得發白的月光，依然是安嫻的照進這都市來，但生活在這都市裏的人，早已失去了往年的情緻了。那些流離着的，家破人亡的，在生活重壓下喘息着的，固然倍增感慨，旣使是悠閒的，當裕的，他們也覺得這個秋天較之抗戰以前的大大不同了。</p>
<p>鮮貨店裏堆滿了紅的頸菓，紫的葡萄，金黃的美橘以及看起來都淸脆的梨，全在襯托着秋的存在。</p>
<p>生意難做　利息高</p>
<p>中秋的前一天月餅已經售光，鮮貨店裏的主顧也川流不息，大把的鈔票遞來遞去。常然這些主顧裏，很少是窮公務員，賺錢的商人固然多，實則賠錢的何嘗沒有。臨到節關，商人習慣上結賬，現款需要多，於是暗息隨風上漲，最高的竟達到日息九十元，合月息二十七分，小商人在這種情勢下，如何能站得住，正因爲銀根緊的原故。最近幾天，除了應節景的東西外，其他物價變動不大，但是多少人在焦慮過節以後的情形，物價是難以穩定的。聽聽商人的傾訴，他們也都有滿腹的委屈。他們都說自己賣着的東西決沒有首先漲價而是追着其他物價跑，究竟是甚麼在領導着物價上漲呢，商人也都曉得說，是大局，一個規規矩矩的商人，他並不願意物價在漲。</p>
<p>幾家歡樂　幾家愁</p>
<p>這幾天，數塲秋雨，金風起處，陣陣生寒，已把天津帶進深秋抗戰期中，離鄕漂泊的人是不能回去，勝利後也有千千萬萬的人被騷亂逼出了家鄉，但善良的人不一定就是懦弱的。前幾天，天津以南各縣流離在津的民衆成立了一個返鄉協進會，幾千個流落在天津的各縣人民，他們都踴躍參加了這個團體，他們要武裝返鄉了。在冀中，冀東，民衆的返鄉運動也都已經蓬勃的發展起來，他們要回到他們的本土，耕作他們的田園，住守他們的家屋，雖有照利阻止他們？他們是善良的，祇希望恢復他們過去瓣安靜生活。</p>
<p>秋風，刮過原野，刮進都市，刮上人們的心。去年秋，天津一百五十萬市民完全跳進勝利的在歡裘。今年秋，人民又陷入戰亂的威脅中。「幾家歡樂幾家愁」？眞的，能歡樂的人太少，而愁苦的人實在太多了！</p>

<h3>開國文獻</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>辛亥革命，推翻了數千年封建專制的傳統，建立了民主共和國家，這在中華民族的歷史上，是一個空前亂要的轉捩點。這裏，我們節錄下一些開國時代的重要文獻。它們並宋因時間的過去而失去價值。因爲它們是永權在　國之路上的不朽里程碑。</p>
<p>孫大總統　就職宣言書</p>
<p>〔中華民國締造之始，而文以不德，　臨時大總統之任，夙夜戒懼，慮無以副國民之望。夫中國專制政治之毒，至二百餘年來而滋甚，一旦以國民之力，掊而去之，起事不過數旬，光復已十餘行省，自有歷史以來，功成未有如是之速者也。國民以組織政府之責相屬，自推功讓能之類念以言，文所不敢任也；自服務盡責之觀念以言，則文所不敢辭也。國家之本，在於人民，合漢滿蒙回藏諸地爲一國，是日民族之統一。武漢起義，十數行省先後獨立，所謂獨立，對於淸廷爲脫離，對於各省爲聯合，是曰領土之統一。血鐘一鳴，義旗四起，擁甲帶戈之士，遍於十餘行省，雖編制或不一，號令或不齊，而目的所在，則無不同，是曰軍政之統一。國家幅員遼關，各省自有其風氣所宜，此後行政，期於中央政府與各省之關係調劑得宜，大綱旣來，條目自舉，是曰內治之統一。國家經費取給於民，必期合於理財學理，而尤在改良社會經濟組織，使人民知有生之樂，是曰財政之統一。以上數者，爲政務之方針，持此進行，庶無大過。若夫革命主義，爲吾儕所昌言，美國所同喩，前此雖屢起屢躓，外人無不鑒其用心，八月以來，義旗飄發，諸友邦對之，抱和平之望，持中立之態，而報紙及與論，尤每表其同情，鄰誼之　，良足深謝。臨時政府成立以後，當持平和主義，與我友邦益增睦誼，將使中國見重於國際社會，且將使世界漸趨於大同，循序以進，不爲倖獲，對外方針，實在於是。今以與我國民初相見之日，披布腹心，惟我四萬萬同胞共鋻之。」</p>
<p>臨時大總統　告各友邦書</p>
<p>「溯自滿洲入主，據無上之威權，施非理之抑勒，裁制民權，抗違公意，我中華民國之智識上，道德上，生計上抓種之進步，坐是遲緩不前。識者謂非實行革命不足以蕩滌舊汚，振作新機。今幸義旗軒舉，犬局垂定，吾中華民國全體，用敢以推倒滿淸專制政府，建設共和民國，布吿於我諸友邦。</p>
<p>易君主政體以共和，此非吾人徒逞一朝之憤也，天賦自由，縈想已夙，祈悠久之幸福，掃前途之障蔽，懷此微忱，久而莫達，今日之事，紫自然發生之結果，亦即吾民國公意所由正式發表者也。</p>
<p>蓋吾中華民族，和平守法，根於天性，非出於自衛之不得已，決不肯輕啓戰端，故自滿淸盜竊中國，於今二百六十有八年，其間處政，罄竹難書，吾民族惟有隱忍受之，初不欲見流血之慘也。屢起屢蹶，卒難達吾人之目的，至於今日，實己忍無可忍，是用訴之武力，冀脫吾人及世世子孫於萬甫覊軛，自由幸福，照　寰宇，不可關非千載難得之盛會也。</p>
<p>滿情政府之政策，質言之，一嫉視異種，自私自使，百折不變之處政而已。吾人受之旣久，迫而出於革命，亦固其所。摧陷舊制，建立新國，誠有所不得不然，讓爲世界諸自由民族樓晰陳之。</p>
<p>當滿淸未竊神器之先，諸夏文明之邦，實許世界各國以交通往來，及宣布敎旨之自由，有明失政，滿夷入主，本其狹隘之心胸，自私之僻見，設爲種種政令，固閉自封，不令中土文明，與世界各邦相接觸，遂使神明之裔，日趨僿野，天賦知能，艱於發展，愚民自鋼，此不獨人道之魔障，抑亦文明各國之公敵歟？</p>
<p>不特此也，滿淸政府欲使多數漢人永遠屈服於其專制之下，而彼得以擁有財富封殖繁育於其間，遂不恤賊害吾民，以岡自利。宗支近系，時擁特權，多數平民，聽其支配，又復徵苛細不法之賦稅，任意取求，迹鄰擄刦。阻國內商務之發颼，妨殖產工業之繁興，則滿洲政府不知獎護實業之過也。</p>
<p>至於用人行政，更無大公不易之常規，嚴刑峻制，慘無人理，賣官　爵，政以賄成，朝頒詔旨，夕即背之，玩弄吾民，已非一次，坐令吾國吾民，遭世界之輕視，而彼殆無動於中焉。</p>
<p>吾人今欲　除上述種種之罪　，俾吾中華民國得與世界各邦敦平等之陸誼，故不恤捐枼生命，與惡政府戰，而別建一良好者以代之。故披瀝陳於各邦之前，我各友邦尙垂鑒之。中華民國臨時大總統孫文簽名。</p>

<h3>復員服務在重慶</h3>
<p>— 九月十七日重慶航訊　三鍼</p>
<p>「社會服務」，在歐美雖是普遍平淡的工作，但在中國，却是稀有的，過去剖曾有零星的工作表現，可是對於廣大的人民，沒有給予深刻的印象。抗戰期間，更由於人力物力財力等的限制，阻礙了它的發展，雖然政府竭力的提倡，並設立了好幾個社會服務的機構，然而由於社會各界對它的漠視，終於沒有引起一般人的注意，而達不到預定的目的。</p>
<p>不斷的內亂　苦了還鄉的靈魂</p>
<p>社會部重慶社會服務處，是全國最先成立的一個爲人民服務的組織，由於五年來不斷的努力，不斷的改進，而打下了良好的基礎，像社會公寓，職業介紹，標準餐，電影院，……等，以低廉的價格，熱誠的服務，給陪都人士一個嶄新的印象，同時亦成爲每個重慶客讚美回憶的資料。</p>
<p>「勝利復員」「還鄕」，喜悅了流浪八年的異鄕客，可亦苦惱着千萬顆迫切需要返鄕的靈魂。交通的工具，無論是水運，陸運，和空運，因了八年來慘痛的犧牲，和一年來不停的內亂，都像患了嚴重的窒息症似的，阻滯了還鄉者的歸程，打破了復員的遠夢，在重慶幾十萬異鄕客，終日焦急，終日徘徊，望着滾滾的江水，蔚藍的天空，只有惆悵，只有興噗！</p>
<p>幸而購到了船票，分配到機位，然而，間題仍是一連串的擺在人們的面前，行李的搬運，食宿的解決，……在在傷人腦筋，嘔人心血。</p>
<p>八角形紅亭　引動還鄉人興趣</p>
<p>於是「復員服務站」在社會部的籌劃下，重慶社會服務處的推動中，成立了起來，在飛機塲，汽車站，綸船碼頭，都有它的踪跡，八角形紅色的崗亭，怪引人注意的，出現在每個返鄉人的眼前。</p>
<p>先說飛機場的服務站吧，本來重慶是沒有三尺平地的山城，除了在長江沙堆上的一個小型機塲外，其餘二個，都還在離市二三十公里的鄉下，而白市驛，更成爲還鄕還都人員飛京的唯一機塲。因此，「社會服務處白市驛復員招待所」亦用宏大的規模，科學的管理，來給千萬個還都人服務。</p>
<p>因了機塲離城太遠，同時返京的飛機大半在黎明起飛，是以復員招待所，在市內特約了一家汽車公司，每天四班，接送乘機的旅客，在機塲內更築造了一所足容三百人的宿舍，裏面分幾十人的集團宿舍，七八人的小型宿舍，一二人的單間宿舍，和專爲婦女設置的婦女宿舍。</p>
<p>除了宿舍是免費外、運冷熱水的取用，行李的接送，亦不化旅客一文，此外更供給書報雜議，舉辦草坪夜會，給旅客解除旅途的寂寞。</p>
<p>食的方面，是五年來社會服務處在重慶久享盛名的「標準餐」，一飯，一菜，一湯，足敷一人食用，亦足够一人的營養，而取費，每餐僅是國幣四百元，這數目，在重慶不够半張電影票呢？</p>
<p>即使化了錢　受不到如此招待</p>
<p>或許，我們會由免費招待住宿，而連想到它設備簡陋，和招待欠周到。在這裏不僅會出乎我們的想像，而且會使我們驚奇呢！只要是從白市驛返京的人，都會回味到宿舍內潔白的牀被，整齊的傢具，莊嚴大方的佈置，彬彬有禮的侍者，即使化了錢，在重慶亦不能找到這麽一個旅館呢！</p>
<p>在市內每個復員路綫的地方，像車站，碼頭，都設置了服務站，每個服務站主要的工作，是代客接遝行李，原先的計劃是包括長程和短程，然而由於交通工具的困難，目前只辦短程的接運，就以朝天門而言：因朝天門是還鄕者乘輪東下的彙合地，每天千百件的行李和公物，從各處流到了這裏，而服務站，便把這批行李運送到每個旅客所乘坐的船上。</p>
<p>至於復員車輛客票的登記，和發售復員木船的管理，更是給還鄉者以極大的協助，年個從川陝，川湘，西南以及乘坐木船東下的返鄕者，永遠不會忘懷這種熱忱的服務。</p>
<p>在宜昌，漢口，南京，亦同樣的設置了同一性質的服務站，而更多的服務站，亦將配合永陸返鄉，而次第出現我們的眼前。</p>
<p>安得廣設服務站千萬所，盡使復員人士俱歡顏！</p>

<p>遠在公歷一八八五年(淸光緒十一年），中法之戰發生，我國戰敗，中山先生痛感內政的腐敗和帝國主義的侵略，乃蓄忘推翻淸廷，創建民國。一八九四年(光緒二十年），中日戰爭發生，先生設興中會於檀香山，次年，在廣州首次舉義，失敗。一九〇五年(光緒三十一年），革命同盟會在東京成立，先後十次起義，有萍醴之役，潮州之役，二次惠州之役，欽廉之役，鎭南關之役，二次欽廉之役，河口之役，安慶之役，二次廣州之役和一九一一年(宣統三年）三月二十九日的黃花岡之役，經十次失敗，方有武昌起義的成功。</p>
<p>當時淸廷爲緩和革命運動的發展，在一九〇六年(光緒三十二年）宣示準備立憲，一九〇八年，頒佈憲法大綱，立法司法大權，仍在皇室，人民無自由可言。一九一一年(宣統三年），淸廷頒佈所謂「鐵路國有」政策，不啻將國家權益，拱手讓諸外人，致引起全國人民的反抗，川·鄂·湘·粤各省紛紛組織保路會，留美華僑，留日學生也先後通電響應，淸廷不但拒絕人民的請求，且用武力彈壓，以趙爾豐爲四川總督，屠殺民衆，人心憤激，同盟會黨人遂聯絡武昌新軍，約定於是年八月十五日起事，不意湖廣總督瑞澂事先接獲密報，謂革命黨人將於中秋節有所舉動，遂下令戒嚴，一時風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵，辛亥八月二十日（公曆一九一一年十月十一日）本報，曾記戴湖北當時情形云：「鄂省近防革黨，煽惑軍人作亂，戒嚴極爲周密，昨聞巡警道又奉鄂督密諭：「革黨概係手持洋傘(傘柄藏有利刃）及皮包(包內儲有炸彈），其服裝與平民無異，惟內襯短裝，分靑白二色，若輩已十九剪髮，裝戴假辮。」當即密飭各處各城門巡警注意，如有可疑之人，即行搜檢，以故連日持洋傘，提皮包者，常被警察盤詰搜查，人心大爲震動。中秋前一日，督署戒備愈嚴，除調憲兵隊，特別警察隊，消防隊，巡警軍，巡防隊分佈督轅內外，又調第八鎭步兵一隊，馬兵一隊駐紥轅外。瑞澂本疑陸軍與革命黨聯合，原不欲用，因張彪力請，謂：「督轅即調他種兵守衛，而不用陸軍，各軍人良莠不齊，未必人人俱入革黨，今明示疑貳，軍心益爲惶惑，匪人愈易煽動，不右擇其篤實者，派來守衛，以安衆心。」瑞澂允之，故在些三種兵中，挑選三隊到轅駐紮，新選各兵，皆由隊官排長保荐，如有他變，惟該隊官等是，官方聲言，此次戒嚴，係因粤督外務部民政部均有電來言：革黨巨魁黃興已率其黨來鄂，定於中秋之夕起事。而外部電係根據北京英公使照會及駐日出使大臣密電，以東京，香港等處革黨，均改裝內渡，聞將有事於武昌云。」</p>
<p>革命黨人和新軍見事機泄漏，戒備嚴密，本擬展期至二十五日起事，不料黨員丁笏堂·劉汝夔·陳化龍·彭楚藩·楊宏勝等忽於十七日在漢口被捕，黨人名册中，各營兵列名者頗多，也被搜去，丁等當被處死，又聞瑞澂將按册一一究辦，人人自危，遂在十八日晚九時，由新軍中附和革命之砲兵及工程隊開槍發難。辛亥八月二十八日（即公曆一九一一年十月十九日）本報，也有常日情景之記述：「革黨原約十九日淸晨三點鐘起事，以火砲爲號，先殺三十標某營旗兵(該營旗人占大半），然後進攻督署，藩署，詎時尙未至，武勝門外四馬路某民家，忽然失愼，城外砲·馬·輜重各營，疑爲號火，先由輜重隊槍斃督隊官，整隊而出，砲·馬隊縱之，破城而進，城內各營，即佔據火藥庫，軍械所，二十九標漢人與三十標旗兵，兩相轟擊，互有死傷，嗣砲隊進城夾攻，旗兵大潰，死亡枕藉，旋即圍攻督署，砲隊以大機關砲七尊，據蛇山直轟，附近一帶，均成灰燼。各兵均左臂挽白布，口號爲「同心協力」四字。」</p>
<p>十九日（公曆一九一一年十月十日）夜，革命軍攻陷總督府，逐走湖廣總督瑞澂，瑞澂避入「楚豫」軍艦，逃往漢口，哀求各國領事以兵艦砲擊革命軍，不得要領，乃即一走了事，後來潛來上海，由兩江總督張人駿派人逮捕，送京治罪。</p>
<p>辛亥八月廿日晨，國民軍代表相聚於諮議局，到會不下數萬人，公舉黎元洪（宋卿）爲湖北軍都督，出示安民，原文如下：「中華民國鄂軍都督黎示：本都督驅逐滿人，恢復漢族，凡我同胞，皆宜謹守秩序，勿遠軍法。所有刑賞各條，開列於後：藏匿滿人者斬，藏匿偵探者斬，買賣不公者斬，傷害外人者斬，擾亂商務者斬，姦擄燒殺者斬，邀約罷市者斬，違抗義師者斬，樂輸糧餉者賞，保護租界者賞，守衛敎堂者賞，率衆投降者賞，勸導鄉民者賞，報吿敵情者賞，維持商務者賞。黃帝紀元四千六百零九年八月日。」</p>
<p>民軍乘勝進攻，淸兵不戰而退，武昌·漢陽·漢口三鎭皆爲民軍佔領。同時，各省革命黨員聞訊，紛紛起兵響應，爲時祇一月，上海·蘇州·浙江·貴州·廣西·安徽·福建等十餘省市相繼宣布獨立，各省民軍聯軍攻克南京，遂在南京組織臨時政府，由十七省代表推舉孫中山先生爲臨時大總統，定爲中華民國元年。</p>
<p>淸廷見大勢已去，起用袁世凱組閣，與民軍議和，並派唐糾儀需議和大臣，民軍代表則爲伍廷芳，雙方在上海舉行會議，其後唐氏辭職，改由袁氏與民軍代表直接電商，是年二月十二日，和議吿成，清帝退位，辛亥革命，遂吿成功。</p>

<h3>Ways to Break the Current Stalemate: The Government Still Advocates Peaceful Negotiation - President Chiang's National Day Address to the Compatriots</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] President Chiang broadcast to the nation at 8 PM tonight via the Central Broadcasting Station for the 35th National Day anniversary. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen,</p>
<p>Today marks the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. It is also the first National Day celebration since the end of the War of Resistance and the return of the government to the capital. Looking back at the hardships endured by the Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in establishing the Republic, commemorating the heroic deeds of the military and civilians during the War of Resistance, and looking forward to the future of unified peace and construction, while reflecting on how hard-won yet easily lost national independence and ethnic freedom are, all of us compatriots should work diligently, encourage each other, continue to move forward, implement the teachings of the Founding Father, accomplish the aspirations of the martyrs, build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People, and achieve the goals of a prosperous and happy Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Founding Father once said, "Building a house cannot be sloppy, and neither can building a nation. One must have an extremely firm spirit and carry it out with extremely patient strength." Thirty-five years have passed since the Xinhai Revolution. Compared to the past, our national revolutionary cause has been advancing. However, the distance to the final success of the national revolution is still very far. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, completed the Northern Expedition, and achieved the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance, we have defeated the aggressive power of Japan, wiped away the national humiliation of the past fifty years, recovered the territory of Taiwan, and regained sovereignty over the Northeast. We have also abolished the unequal treaties that had bound us for a century and established the foundation for friendly cooperation with countries around the world. These are all significant achievements of the national revolution, which are sufficient to comfort the spirits of the</p>
<p>Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in heaven. The ability of our National Government to concentrate the will of all compatriots and combine their strength to overcome the national difficulties that were superimposed on each other, and to overcome the crisis of internal and external troubles, in order to achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance, proves that the National Government's policy of revolutionary nation-building conforms to the wishes of all compatriots. Today, as we review the achievements of the past, we must continue to strive together to safeguard the independence and freedom of the nation, and especially to consistently implement the teachings of the Founding Father's Three Principles of the People, so that our China can become an independent, unified, strong, and democratic country and a pillar of peace in the Far East. The Founding Father said, "The creator of the Republic of China has the goal of peace." Today, as we commemorate the Xinhai Revolution, we must repeat these words.</p>
<p>On this day last year, I explained that the work ahead is "Nation-Building First." On New Year's Day this year, I again explained to my compatriots the necessity of national unity and political democracy. Unfortunately, everything has not been realized as expected in the past ten months. Until now, turmoil and disturbances have not ceased. All of my compatriots are indirectly suffering from the pain of a country that cannot be peaceful, a society that cannot be stable, and a life that is not guaranteed. This is truly infinitely painful. How should we stabilize the foundation of our country? How should we bring the current abnormal state into the right track? I want to take this opportunity to sincerely inform my fellow countrymen.</p>
<h3>The Basic Conditions for Nation-Building Lie in the Unification of Military and Political Orders</h3>
<p>The goal of our national revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unity and social stability. If social order cannot be stabilized, the lives and property of the people cannot be guaranteed, agricultural and industrial production will naturally have no way to develop, and the living standards of the people will have no way to improve. At the same time, if national unity cannot be consolidated, internal strife will inevitably occur frequently, the foundation of democracy will naturally be impossible to establish, and the cause of nation-building will have no way to begin. Therefore, the government's current policy towards the current situation is to ensure national unity first and to seek unity through peaceful means. We know that the minimum conditions for national unity are the unification of military and political orders. To achieve the unification of military orders, we must implement the nationalization of the military and establish a national army. To achieve the unification of political orders, the laws and regulations of the country must be able to be implemented throughout the country, eliminating local separatism. If there are two opposing armies in one country, and the local politics form a separatist situation, then it cannot be called a unified country. Therefore, today, to strive for peace, we must consolidate national unity. It can be said that without unity, there is no peace in China today, and unity is the only condition for peace. If this condition is denied or destroyed, it will not only prolong the suffering of the people, but also lead to the demise of the country. This is the key to the vital interests and lives of every person, and it is also the inescapable responsibility of the government. The government cannot turn a blind eye to rebellions that hinder unity and attempt to split the country, and all compatriots cannot stand idly by and watch the disasters that endanger the national lifeline and destroy the lives of the people, placing the country and nation in a situation from which it cannot recover.</p>
<p>The Government is Willing to Make Concessions and Show Restraint to Seek Unity</p>
<p>However, the government still insists on seeking a solution to the current domestic political problems through political means. This policy will never change, because we cannot bear to destroy the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance with our own hands, we cannot allow the suffering of the people after the war to deepen, and we must not allow the opportunity for peaceful nation-building to be frustrated and delayed. Therefore, in the past year, the government has done its best, making any concessions and showing any restraint, always aiming to seek national unity, avoid conflict, and jointly discuss national affairs. The convocation of the Political Consultative Conference was aimed at this. The recent statements made by the government have also focused on this. No matter how severe the domestic turmoil and disputes are, as long as there is a glimmer of hope for a peaceful solution, the government will never abandon the path of peace. The peaceful path to achieving national unity today is to nationalize the military and democratize politics. How to achieve political democratization is to convene a National Assembly and expand the government organization, so that the government can fulfill its desire to return power to the people, and the people can have the opportunity to exercise political power. How to achieve the nationalization of the military is to follow the established plan for military reorganization and consolidation, divide military regions, stipulate schedules, and implement them within a time limit, so that no party or faction can use force for political struggle in the future. Only in this way can our China become a truly unified and democratic country.</p>
<p>Requesting all Parties and Factions to Participate in the National Assembly</p>
<p>What the government asks of all parties and factions today is to participate in the National Government and attend the National Assembly. What it asks of the Communist Party is only to abandon its attempts to seize territory by force and split the country, and to participate in the National Assembly with all parties and factions. The realization of this step is an established case agreed upon by all parties and factions, and it is also the unanimous demand of all compatriots. It is hoped that all parties and factions will submit the list of members of the National Government and representatives to the National Assembly as scheduled, so that the National Government can be reorganized as soon as possible, and the National Assembly can be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>What I want to explain to my compatriots in particular now is the issue of ceasing military conflicts. This has always been the consistent goal of our government, and what the government hopes for is a comprehensive and permanent cessation of conflicts. The Military Tripartite Conference in June was originally aimed at discussing the restoration of transportation and the determination of troop positions, in order to realize the guarantee of ceasing conflicts. However, it was stalled due to the Communist Party's insistence on its own opinions. In order to achieve lasting peace, I have made several suggestions in the past three months, hoping that the Communist Party would accept them, but they were all rejected. Later, they asked to immediately convene a meeting of the Military Tripartite Group chaired by General Marshall, but due to the experience of past facts, if an agreement and understanding on several major basic issues are not reached first, the reopening of the Tripartite Conference will inevitably be of no avail. Therefore, I firmly support the convening of a Five-Person Conference centered on Ambassador Stuart first, so that the government and the Chinese Communist Party can reach an agreement on the issue of organizing the National Government Committee, to show their sincerity in jointly abiding by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and to use this as a basis for obtaining the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. After this sincerity and basis are established, new mutual trust and mutual assistance can be obtained. I also advocate that at the same time as the cessation of conflicts is announced, the Chinese Communist Party should submit a list of its representatives to the National Assembly to be convened on November 12, to show its sincerity in cooperating with the government. If it could have proceeded in this way at that time, I believe that the cessation of conflicts would have been realized long ago.</p>
<h3>President's Broadcast Recorded</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] On the eve of National Day, President Chiang broadcast to the nation from his office at the Huangpu Road official residence. The broadcasting station installed recording equipment in advance. During the President's broadcast, he appeared very happy. After the sound recording was completed, the President listened to it once and expressed great satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Simultaneous Convocation of the Five-Person and Three-Person Conferences to Facilitate Agreement on Military and Political Affairs</h3>
<p>Now, the Communist Party has neither accepted the two proposals put forward by the government on October 2 regarding the reorganization of the National Government and the implementation of the military reorganization plan, nor has it rejected the ceasefire proposal made by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. However, the government does not give up the policy of peaceful resolution because of this. The government still hopes to seek a solution through mediation and negotiation. We cannot allow the current political and military situation in our country to continue to develop, deepening the suffering of the people. Furthermore, in view of the current tense situation and the general anxiety caused by the lack of understanding of government policies, I solemnly declare on this National Day that the way to break the current stalemate is still to use peaceful negotiation to seek a solution to several basic issues. Once the following issues are agreed upon, the government is prepared to issue an order to cease conflicts immediately. I advocate that the Five-Person Conference and the Three-Person Conference should be convened simultaneously. First, the Five-Person Group Conference should discuss the reorganization of the National Government. Second, the Three-Person Group Conference should resolve issues related to the implementation of the military reorganization and consolidation plan. Once an agreement is reached, as long as the Communist Party can cease its military actions and no longer attack the National Army, the government will immediately issue an order to cease conflicts. The above is the government's policy for handling the current situation. For the sake of the future of the country and for the sake of the people's interests, this is the only practical and feasible way to achieve peaceful unification. In short, the government never gives up the expectation of open and sincere negotiations with the Communist Party under any circumstances. As long as the Communist Party takes the national lifeline and the people's lives as its priority, eliminates prejudices, understands the government's difficulties, and implements the above methods, then not only can the cessation of conflicts be realized immediately, but the work of peaceful nation-building can also be achieved smoothly without any obstacles.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, our victory in the eight-year War of Resistance in the past was due to the unanimous unity and persevering struggle of all our compatriots from beginning to end. In the future, the great cause of nation-building will still require all our compatriots to uphold firm confidence, follow definite steps, practice diligently, never give up, promote the implementation of the Five-Power Constitution, ensure the completion of the Three Principles of the People, and especially to unite in one mind and take on our responsibilities together, consolidate national unity, stabilize social order, establish a foundation for peace, and complete the great cause of nation-building, so that we can carry out the will of the Founding Father and not be ashamed of the heroic souls of the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance. (End)</p>
<h3>Minister Peng's Speech</h3>
<p>The Government Still Hopes to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Intentions Are Difficult to Fathom</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Foreign reporters' reception. Held at 3:30 PM on the 9th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei. The following is a record of Minister Peng's answers to questions from reporters:</p>
<p>Q: It is heard that the Chinese Communist Party has rejected the proposal for a ten-day ceasefire. What is the government's attitude?</p>
<p>A: The government's position has been seen in Premier Soong's speech. The Communist Party's intentions are difficult to fathom. It has rejected negotiations on the reorganization of the National Government, and it has also rejected discussions on resolving military issues to permanently eliminate conflict. Now, it has rejected the proposal for a ten-day ceasefire. All of these were constantly requested by the Chinese Communist Party. When the government accepted them, the Chinese Communist Party rejected them instead. Observers say that it is adopting a policy of obstruction and does not sincerely want to resolve the issue to help create a unified situation. Its actions make it impossible for people not to doubt it. The government's policy, as stated by Premier Soong, is still to hope that negotiations will continue in order to seek a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Q: How many miles are the National Army from Zhangjiakou?</p>
<p>A: The National Army entered Bei on the 8th, about eighty Chinese miles from Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>Q: Does the government still intend to convene the National Assembly on November 12 and reorganize the government?</p>
<p>A: The government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12. Because the postponement has been several times, if it is postponed again, it may be difficult for the people to bear it, which may cause them to doubt the government's determination to implement constitutional government. As for the reorganization of the government, it has been hindered by the Chinese Communist Party's rejection of negotiations.</p>
<p>Q: What is the military situation in Northern Jiangsu and the Northeast?</p>
<p>A: The National Army in Northern Jiangsu has entered Gao-. Baoying. In the Northeast, the Communist Army has taken some actions to coordinate with the Northern Army inside the Pass, but they are not worth mentioning. The Communist Army's base area between Dolun and Chengde has fallen into the hands of the National Army. Shandong has recovered Xian and Zaozhuang. Zaozhuang is a coal mining center, but the machinery has been dismantled, which is deeply regrettable. This kind of action only harms the people in the mining area and strikes at the industry in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Marshall Made a Trip to Shanghai Yesterday to Visit Zhou Enlai, the Content of the Conversation is Unknown, the China Democratic League's Liang Shuming Proposed Another Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Conner, a press officer at the US Embassy, announced on the 9th that Special Envoy Marshall flew to Shanghai by special plane at 9 AM on the 9th to meet with General Zhou Enlai and returned to Beijing at 6 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Ma went to Shanghai on the 9th specifically to invite Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing to participate in peace talks. It is learned that Zhou Enlai has refused to return to Beijing, and the government is studying the next step.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Peace negotiations have become a thread hanging by a thread. Special Envoy Ma made a trip to Shanghai on the 9th, and his efforts and painstaking efforts in mediation can be seen from this. On the morning of the 9th, Liang Shuming of the China Democratic League visited Special Envoy Stuart for a long talk. Liang then went to the Senate to visit Lei Zhen, and after leaving, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Wang Shijie. It is reported that Liang has proposed a compromise plan that both sides can accept, but the content is kept secret by all parties. According to Liang, this is a new path beyond the three-person and five-person conferences, but it is not yet time to publish it. In addition, Yu Dawei visited Special Envoy Stuart at 11:20 AM and talked for an hour. Fu Jingbo visited Premier Soong at 11:30 AM. At 6:30 PM, Premier Soong visited Special Envoy Stuart and talked for an hour, and then went to Special Envoy Ma's residence, leaving at 9 PM. Judging from the meetings of all parties, it is possible that there will be developments soon. It is rumored that Special Envoy Stuart will publish a document on the 10th, but the content has not been learned. When the reporter asked the Chinese Communist Party about its attitude towards Premier Soong's statement, it was said that the Chinese Communist Party had two points of view: (1) The Chinese Communist Party agreed in the past to participate in the informal Five-Person Conference to ensure that a ceasefire would be implemented after the discussion of the reorganization of the government was considered to have results. However, the US side and the government did not obtain this guarantee. Therefore, this caused the government to refuse the guarantee, not the Communist Party to refuse to participate. The Communist Party confirmed that it was impossible to talk about reorganizing the government while fighting a civil war. (2) No notification was received about the proposal to hold the Three-Person and Five-Person Conferences together, so there was no response, not a rejection. A spokesman for the Communist Party believed that Premier Zhu's statement had no basis in fact. The spokesman also reiterated his hope in response to Special Envoy Ma's statement on the 8th that the mediator would have a fair plan that could be accepted by both the government and the Communist Party, so that there would be major developments in the future of peace.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Criticizes Marshall's Statement in a Reception for Reporters</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, this city, 9th] Zhou Enlai hosted the press here tonight, criticizing the statement issued yesterday by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, saying that some points were inconsistent with the facts, and disclosed that he had submitted eleven suggestions to President Chiang to implement the agreements negotiated in Chongqing in January and February. When asked to confirm the rumor that Special Envoy Ma flew to Shanghai today to persuade him to go to Beijing to reopen peace talks, but was rejected, causing Special Envoy Ma to return to Beijing alone, Zhou said, "No comment."</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Chen Jiakang, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, issued the following statement on the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si: (1) Before the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si was issued yesterday (the 8th), the Chinese Communist Party was not notified. Even at 4 PM that afternoon, after the statement was issued, when Dong Biwu, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, was invited to meet with Special Envoys Ma and Si, the two Special Envoys did not inform him of the issuance of the statement. As for the three points of the Chinese Communist Party's reply conveyed orally by Wang Bingnan, they were not corrected before being published. (2) The original text of the suggestions delivered by Special Envoys Ma and Si to Wang Bingnan on October 6 clearly stated that the ten-day suspension of the attack on Zhangjiakou was conditional, that is, for the purpose of implementing (To Carry Out) Chairman Chiang's two requests on October 2. Therefore, the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si avoided publishing the original text of the suggestions. (3) The joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si confirmed that the method of delaying the attack on Zhangjiakou for ten days was proposed by Special Envoys Ma and Si. This was nothing more than a delaying tactic for the government, forcing the Chinese Communist Party to surrender under the city.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was widely rumored that Zhou Enlai was preparing to go to Beijing, but the Zhou Gongguan in Shanghai said that they knew nothing about it.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Assembly Friendship Association</h3>

The reporter visited Song Kentang, chief of staff of the 11th War Zone, who had just returned from Nankou on the 9th. According to him, he had not yet received a report from the front, but another military authority had acquiesced and said that the National Army passing through Huailai was developing on both sides of the railway. Therefore, whether Huailai has been recovered cannot be completely confirmed by officials. Song Kentang said: The Communist Army's strength in that area is very strong. The main forces of Nie Rongzhen, He Long, Xiao Ke, and others are concentrated in eastern Chahar. Song also said: After the National Army recovered Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou is already in sight, so the recovery of Zhangjiakou should not be far away. Song also said: The National Army in Rehe has entered the territory of Chahar.</p>

This is the action after the end of the battles in Chahar Province and Northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>National Government Officially Orders Resumption of Conscription</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] The National Government officially ordered the resumption of conscription on the 10th. The original order is as follows: "Ever since the brutal Japanese invaded our territory, in order to defend the independence of our nation and safeguard the survival of our people, we implemented conscription and rose up to fight. Over the past eight years, we have conscripted tens of millions of soldiers and finally achieved final victory, restoring our land and rejoicing the entire nation. On the day of the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to allow the people to rest, we issued an order to the entire country to suspend conscription for one year. However, in order to establish a nation today, we must consolidate our national defense to survive, and we must implement a conscription system to enrich our national strength. During this period of suspension, we have revised the original conscription laws and regulations and re-established the divisional and regimental districts, focusing on the needs of national defense, and determined the peacetime conscription system to continue handling conscription affairs. All our citizens must know that serving in the military is a duty that everyone should fulfill, and implementing a conscription system is the only way to build a strong nation. As the suspension period has expired, we will resume conscription starting from October 10th of this year. Those who are required to serve according to the law must strive hard, enthusiastically enlist, thereby establishing a military foundation and consolidating national defense. We have high hopes for this." This is the order.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] Mrs. Cripps and her daughter, at 3:35 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, arrived in Nanjing on the Meiling special plane that went to pick them up, landing at Ming Palace Airport. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs arranged the national flags of China and Britain at the airport, as well as a large banner welcoming Mrs. Cripps, which was solemn and eye-catching.

Mrs. Cripps was wearing a blue-based white checkered dress, a silk scarf, black flat leather shoes, a small leather bag, a light gray hat, and silver-white short hair fluttering around the edge of the hat. She was very tall. After Mrs. Cripps got off the plane, she stood respectfully for a few minutes, listening to the music of the British national anthem and the Chinese national anthem. Mayor Ma and his wife were the first to step forward to deliver a welcome speech. Mrs. Cripps replied: "Nanjing is a world-famous city, and I am very honored to be here." She then shook hands with the people who came to greet her. Chen Yi, a student representative from Ginling Women's College, presented a bouquet of flowers.

<h3>A Brief Biography of Mrs. Cripps</h3>
<p>"The journey is long and far,</p>
<p>But good intentions are hard to resist.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people remember,</p>
<p>Eagerly awaiting with open arms."</p>
<p>—Poem presented by Ambassador Zheng to the UK</p>
<p>Mrs. Cripps has come to China. She is the president of the British United Aid to China Fund. This organization brings together many enthusiastic people who respect and sympathize with China, and under Mrs. Cripps' leadership, has given the Chinese people who suffered during the war much warm friendship and much material and spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cripps' husband, Sir Stafford Cripps, is a leading figure in the British Labour Party and the author of the famous "Cripps Plan" for India. In 1940, when the Labour Party was not yet in power, he visited China as a Member of Parliament and delivered several speeches in Chongqing. After returning home, he wrote down the suffering of the Chinese people in the long war, based on what he had seen and heard. These accounts greatly moved Mrs. Cripps, arousing her deep understanding and concern for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>At that time, many British non-governmental organizations that sympathized with China wanted to unite and concentrate their efforts to do some work that would benefit the Chinese people. In June 1942, the United Aid to China Fund was finally established under such demands. Mrs. Cripps was the most active person in promoting this organization, and under unanimous election, she became the president of the United Aid to China Fund. She made radio appeals on the wireless, urging everyone to tighten their belts and donate money to help the Chinese people. At the same time, she wrote to members of Congress and people's organizations in various countries, asking them to unite and help promote this work. The Labour Party also provided special assistance, contacting various trade unions and industrial cooperative organizations to support the progress of her cause.</p>
<p>Due to such widespread response, the United Aid to China Fund raised a considerable sum of money before the Double Tenth National Day that year and remitted it to Madame Chiang, mainly for the relief of Chinese war orphans and wounded soldiers. Since then, fundraising has continued to this day, and the funds remitted to China have reached more than 1.8 million British pounds. The donations received by the United Aid to China Fund came from all over the United Kingdom, as well as from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The letters from those donors fully expressed their infinite admiration and sympathy for China. The office of the London United Aid to China Fund keeps many such letters.</p>
<p>Because of Mrs. Cripps' great achievements in presiding over the United Aid to China Fund, the British King specially awarded her a GBE medal this year on New Year's Day. This is the highest medal awarded by the British government to women who have made meritorious contributions to the country. Although Mrs. Cripps has always been an enthusiastic China lover, and she often likes to talk about the East with her friends, she has only been to the Soviet Union herself and has never been to China. This time, she is visiting the country she has always thought of for the first time. I wonder if what we can give her will be joy or disappointment?</p>
<p>Also accompanying Mrs. Cripps this time is Mrs. Miller, who is also one of the founders of the United Aid to China Fund, a well-known social worker. She is now the secretary of the United Aid to China Fund. She has presided over most of the administrative work of the United Aid to China Fund for several years and is also Mrs. Cripps' main assistant.</p>

<h3>Siamese Chinese Steel Rails Diverted to Southern Country - No Guarantee of Repayment from the South - Promise Not to Transfer Railway Accessories to Others</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 8th] Chen Zhimao, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, stated: Officials from the State Department assured the Chinese Embassy that all steel rails designated for China by UNRRA that are diverted to Yugoslavia will be fully repaid with steel rails designated for Yugoslavia. Counselor Chen said: "Diverting famine-relief steel rails to other countries will certainly affect our country's economic recovery efforts, but he also said that steel rails are not as important as accessories such as screw needles, screw sleeves, and spikes needed when laying rails, and the State Department has also promised that these difficult-to-obtain items will not be transferred to others, because without these accessories, the steel rails cannot be used. He hopes that the US government will immediately withdraw the order to stop the transportation of such items to China, because the Chinese Minister of Communications recently informed officials of the Chinese Embassy that there are currently many warehouses that can store steel rails, and a large number of steel rails have been stored in Shanghai, waiting for the transportation of laying rail accessories for application. He also said: "Our assumption is that restoring transportation is the key to solving China's recovery problem. The State Department has assured us that China will not suffer losses in this regard, and it is now time to re-consider the embargo order."</p>

<h3>Most of the Japanese Compensation is for Heavy Industry - We Will Carry Out Demolition and Relocation Soon - Remarks After the Return of the Delegation to Japan to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the auditorium of the Central Daily News at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th and invited Wu Wenzao, Wu Bannong, Xu Yiqiao, and Xiang Zhexun, members of the delegation to Japan who had recently returned to China, to attend and answer questions for reporters. The details are as follows: (1) The delegation to Japan is divided into four groups: 1. Military, 2. Political, social and economic research, 3. Economic compensation for trade with Japan, 4. Education and culture. The amount of compensation is very large, mostly for heavy industry, military industry, arsenals, aircraft equipment, manufacturing plants, thermal power plants, machine tool bearing factories, shipyards, etc. We have fought the longest and suffered the most. Assuming that we can receive 30% of the total amount, then 4 million tons of equipment will be transported here. Our country will carry out demolition and relocation work, but it can only be moved to the Japanese coast. Negotiations are currently underway to move it to our country, but there are no results yet. (2) Regarding the situation of Japanese textile factories, their pre-war spindle count was very large, but after suspension and destruction, there were also many losses. Currently, 2.46 million spindles have been repaired, and 1.2 million spindles are being repaired. MacArthur has set this number as the maximum limit for the development of the Japanese textile industry (China currently has 4 million spindles). (3) Japanese political parties had parties but no power before the surrender. Only after the surrender were they able to obtain freedom of activity. By October last year, there were more than 200 large and small parties. Now, after elimination, there are only five or six major parties left. The Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the Socialist Party are relatively powerful, and the Communist Party is the weakest.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Forcing a Smile to Celebrate National Day</h3>
<p>It has been more than a full year since the victory, and the second National Day after the victory has unexpectedly passed in a depressing atmosphere. Everyone who saw the national flags of the Republic of China flying all over the streets and cities was smiling on the surface, but sighing in their hearts! Perhaps we didn't understand the taste of "forcing a smile" before, but today, as we celebrate National Day, we are all carrying heavy hearts. We can still hear the sounds of fighting on the battlefield, and we originally hoped that there would be an order for a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, and the comforting news of the reopening of peace talks, to decorate this Double Tenth National Day, but now they have all turned into dreams! Despite Chairman Chiang's earnest radio instructions, and the government's clear announcement that it still hopes to continue negotiations, the Chinese Communists have been fickle and still refuse to participate in peace talks, which ultimately prevents the people from having a peaceful National Day. We can only force a smile today, and we really owe it to the Chinese Communists!</p>
<p>On last year's National Day, not long after the victory, three or four million citizens of Shanghai celebrated to their hearts' content, with extreme enthusiasm, truly a scene of "everyone in the streets, as if drunk or in a dream." How time flies, and how many feelings arise! The joyous faces of last year have probably all turned into sad faces this year! Even if they are not all frowning, at least they all feel dull and lackluster! We fought hard for eight years and finally won, which was originally glorious, and should have been shining brightly; but this deserved glory has been burned black by the flames of "liberation" and "struggle" by troublemakers.</p>
<p>Originally, peace was the only way out for China's post-war nation-building, and the only way to achieve peace was for both the government and the Chinese Communists to be sincere and show each other their sincerity. Peace talks, peace talks, have been talked about for a year and still cannot achieve peace. The crux of the problem is the lack of this word "sincerity"; even if it is not that both sides are insincere, at least one side is not sincere. "Without sincerity, there is nothing," so what results can we hope for! But today, the Chinese Communists do not blame themselves for their insincerity, but instead blame the mediator for being biased. Nothing in the world is more bizarre than this. In fact, what does China's affairs have to do with the United States? The reason why American friends are so enthusiastic about acting as Lu Zhonglian is nothing more than hoping for a peaceful world, where humanity will no longer fight a third world war. But judging from the style of the Chinese Communists, it seems that they are determined to create a divided situation in China, in order to provide this continent as a battlefield in a future third world war. As we encounter our disaster-ridden National Day on the stage where the Chinese Communists are deliberately playing this kind of drama, how can we truly laugh from the bottom of our hearts?</p>
<p>National Day is a joyous occasion. "When people are happy, their spirits are refreshed," but this year, when we encounter National Day, we only feel depressed and may not be able to turn our tears into smiles. The government has allowed a ten-day ceasefire, but the Chinese Communists still refuse to negotiate. What is the reason for this? According to a United Press International dispatch from Nanjing, people now believe that the Chinese Communists are actually trying to promote a joint mediation by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and are especially focused on the Soviet Union. If this is the case, then the reason why the Chinese Communists have repeatedly changed their demands, and even made new demands after the previous demands have been met, but have always refused to participate in peace talks, is nothing more than to express their distrust of Marshall, force Marshall to return home, and replace the United States with the Soviet Union as they wish. This method of having no sincerity of one's own and hoping for a change of mediator is just a delaying tactic in the process of the Chinese Communists' attempt to divide China, and is not worth our surprise.</p>
<p>However, speaking of mediation, whether it can be successful still depends on whether both parties involved have the seeds of sincerity, and has nothing to do with the mediator. The greatest ability of the mediator is only to try to inspire the potential sincerity of both parties. If neither party, or one party, has any sincerity in reconciliation at all, then even if you change a hundred mediators, it will be of no avail. It is said that when Lu Longqi was the magistrate of Pinghu, there were two brothers who were in dispute over property and were involved in litigation. Lu Sheng堂, put the lawsuit aside, first pointed to the younger brother and asked the elder brother, "Who is he to you?" The elder brother said, "Is he my younger brother?" Lu said, "Why don't you try calling him!" The elder brother obeyed and called out "Brother." Lu again instructed the younger brother in the same way, and the younger brother also obeyed and called out "Older brother." Lu pretended to be nonchalant, but instructed them to call out again in the same way. The brothers in the dispute called out like this dozens of times, and suddenly hugged each other and cried bitterly, unanimously applying to give up the property and end the lawsuit. Lu then kindly persuaded them, closed the case, and left the court. A lawsuit was thus concluded. These two brothers were initially blinded by a selfish thought, and entered litigation because of the dispute. Once they discovered their conscience, they hugged each other and cried bitterly, and the violent atmosphere turned into auspicious harmony. From this, we can know that if the two sides in a dispute cannot be reconciled, there is no need to blame the mediator. They should first reflect on themselves and dig up their own conscience.</p>
<p>Although there are rumors that Marshall may return home, Marshall and Stuart both said that they will still do their best if there is room for it. This spirit of knowing that it cannot be done but doing it is truly admirable. We believe that these two old men of peace are qualified to be Lu Longqi, and we also believe that thousands of Chinese people are qualified to be Lu Longqi, and there is no need to bother with changing mediators. But I wonder if the Chinese Communists, after the government has called them "brother" a few times, are willing to call back a few times "older brother," and once they can also hug each other and cry bitterly, release their soldiers and make peace, so that after we have spent this depressed and worried National Day, we will actually receive happy news from the sky? We hope that the miracle of Lu Longqi in the Pinghu County hall can ultimately appear on the Chinese political stage at this time and in this place.</p>

<h3>Changshu Japanese Military Police Captain's Heinous Crimes Confirmed: Piles of White Bones Unearthed Beneath Mount Yu, Loyal Remains Sought Amidst Sun-Drenched Wasteland, Military Tribunal Comforts Loyal Souls</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] On July 9, 1943, Taicang, a land of fish and rice in Jiangsu Province, suffered an unprecedented calamity under the iron heel of the Japanese invaders. A group of murderous devils, the Changshu Japanese Military Police and the Taicang Japanese Military Police, dispatched a large force and, under trumped-up charges, arrested more than fifty patriotic youths and innocent civilians within Taicang.</p>
<p>Roll of Twenty-Two Loyal Souls</p>
<p>These more than fifty people were all taken to the Changshu Japanese Military Police station, where they were subjected to all kinds of abuse, torture, and coercion. It was not until December of that year, after repeated requests from the puppet Taicang County Magistrate Tang Jianxun to the Military Police Captain Yonemura Haruki, that some thirty-odd people were released. The remaining twenty-two people, whose names are Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Yu Zifan, Wen Xingwu, Ye Zhenxi, Wang Xueliang, Lu Xiaoyun, Shen Hongyi, Wang Zhaoyi, Yang Yuntian, Xu Renda, Xu Rongrang, Hu Zhengqing, Jin Zhongshan, Zheng Shushi, Huang Baoliang, Qian Xinyi, Dai Jiaxiang, Jin Jianyong, Wei Guangzhao, Chen Tianliang, and Gu Xixi, regrettably disappeared from this world, their whereabouts unknown. Undoubtedly, they had long been brutally murdered by those demons. However, the most appalling thing was that the demons even destroyed the bodies and refused to leave the ashes for their families. Whenever family members went to inquire about their whereabouts, they always gave vague answers, saying either that they had been transferred to Nanjing or Shanghai, or that they had fallen ill and been sent to the hospital. Sadly, under their clutches, they could only swallow their grievances and shed tears, and until now, the remains of their loved ones are still unknown.</p>
<p>Investigating Without Reservations</p>
<p>Victory came, and the Changshu Japanese Military Police Captain Yonemura Haruki, who had committed all kinds of evil deeds, was finally arrested by the authorities and tried by the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. However, after several interrogations, the cunning Yonemura, apart from admitting that he had sent seventeen people, including Wang Xueliang, to the Military Tribunal of the Japanese 13th Army in Shanghai to be executed, insisted that Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Yu Zifan, Wen Xingwu, and Ye Zhenxi died of illness in the county hospital at the time.</p>
<p>Did these five people actually go to the county hospital? If they did, what were their conditions? What was the treatment process like? If they recovered, how were they discharged? If they died, where are their bodies? These points are crucial and necessary for sentencing. Therefore, the Military Tribunal specially sent the Chief Clerk of the Tribunal, Li Ye, to Changshu to conduct a thorough on-the-spot investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Li went to Suzhou last Thursday, but turned back halfway due to flooding on the highway. He went again the day before yesterday. Upon hearing this, the reporter obtained Mr. Li's consent to travel with him in the same car.</p>
<p>The "Victory" bus took us to Suzhou early in the morning. We transferred to a car and arrived in Changshu around ten o'clock. This is a quiet and peaceful city, with small bridges, flowing water, white walls, and black tiles, still retaining some ancient charm. The local leisure class still spends their time in tea houses listening to storytellers.</p>
<p>Finding Clues Through Circuitous Inquiries</p>
<p>After getting off the car, we immediately went to visit the County Magistrate. The location of the County Government was the former site of the Military Police Station. Unfortunately, as soon as we stepped into the gate, we saw a sign that read "County Magistrate on Official Business." It turned out that the County Magistrate had gone to Yangcheng Lake. A Secretary Ye received us. After Chief Li submitted the official documents and explained the purpose of our visit, Secretary Ye, because he was from Guangdong and had only recently taken office, was not very familiar with the local situation. He then asked Gao Caizuo, a supervisor in the County Government, to be our guide.</p>
<p>Supervisor Gao is truly a typical sincere and enthusiastic gentleman. He accompanied us throughout the day, searching for clues. Without his help, our work would have been much more difficult. Our main task was to investigate the county hospital during the enemy puppet period, but this hospital had long been disbanded. The only clue was the current public hospital.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Jishi, the director of the public hospital, is a very thin man with severe nearsightedness. He strongly agreed with our purpose but expressed his inability to help. He hung up his own sign as a doctor during the occupation period, so he was not clear about the situation of the county hospital. He said that the last two directors of the county hospital were Zhang Xia and Jin Shaozhou. The former's whereabouts are currently unknown. The latter was once detained after the victory for selling public property of the hospital, but it is unknown how he was released and where he is now hiding. The atrocities committed by Yonemura in Changshu were indeed countless. He often killed people at midnight, tied them up and took them to the wilderness outside the North Gate, either stabbing them to death with bayonets or smearing them with beef and letting wolves and dogs devour them, so there was no way to find the remains. In disappointment, we still insisted on asking him for help, asking if there were any doctors, nurses, or even janitors or tea servers who had worked in the county hospital at that time who we could interview. He closed his eyes and thought for a while, finally telling us a name and an address, which was the wife of the former director Zhang Xia, the obstetrician Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>A Clerk's Episode</p>
<p>After leaving the public hospital, local reporters actually got the news and rushed to interview us. For the convenience of my work, I have always maintained the identity of the Military Tribunal Clerk. They also asked me for news. It can be said that it was "reporters interviewing reporters," which was also an interesting episode of this trip.</p>
<p>After winding and twisting, we finally found No. 5 Baoben Street. The sign of an obstetrician was hung outside. We pushed the door open and went in. Inside were an old woman with white hair and a middle-aged woman. They were quite surprised to see our three unexpected guests. We asked, "Is Dr. Ye in?" They said she was sick, but she finally came out from the inner room. Her face was indeed very pale, and she was about thirty years old, with two small braids. We explained the purpose of our visit and repeatedly explained that finding her would not be detrimental to her in any way. Our purpose was to investigate Yonemura's crimes. We only needed to know: whether Wu Yucang and the other five people were sent to the hospital at that time, and what happened after they were sent in. Dr. Ye and her family seemed somewhat guarded against us. Although she said she understood the situation very well and knew it would not be related to her, she said that Director Zhang Xia had left the county hospital at the end of 1942 and handed it over to the last director, Jin Shaozhou. She herself had also resigned at the beginning of 1943, so she naturally had no way of knowing what happened later. Finally, she introduced us to another female doctor, Pang Jiyun, who, according to her, had worked until the hospital was disbanded.</p>
<p>Although we suffered two disappointments, as long as there were other clues, we still cheered up and sought further development. Walking near County East Street, we saw from afar the sign of "Dr. Pang Jiyun" hanging at the door of a grocery store. A couple was eating in the store. We asked if Dr. Pang was in. The woman stood up and greeted us to go to a doctor's room inside. It turned out that she was Dr. Pang. Her attitude seemed very sincere, but she also could not be sure whether Wu Yucang and the other five people had been sent to the hospital. She said that there were many patients being sent in and out of the hospital at that time, and she herself lived outside the hospital, so she did not know the details. However, she told us some of the situation in the hospital. She said that the patients who were sent in were all very ill as a result of being abused and tortured. Moreover, regardless of whether the patients recovered or died, they were all returned to the Military Police for continued imprisonment or burial. In addition, she also heard that the Military Police often killed people outside the North Gate at midnight. Finally, she pointed us to another way, to visit Mr. Chen Yunzhou, an old man who had been the clerk in charge of affairs in the hospital from the beginning until it was disbanded.</p>
<p>Visiting The Graves Without a Clue</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's house is located in Luotuo Bay, Qixian River, in the city. After much searching, we finally found the number of his house. This can be said to be our last hope. The door opened, and a middle-aged woman insisted on asking the purpose of our visit. We claimed to be friends of Mr. Chen and came to visit him. Only then did she let us in. After waiting in the living room for a few minutes, Mr. Chen came out with a cane. His cheeks were sunken, he was wearing a melon-skin hat and thin cotton-padded clothes. It is said that he had just recovered from a serious illness, so his voice was low and his breathing was short. We explained the purpose of our visit to him and repeatedly told him that this matter would not be related to him in any way, hoping that he would tell us as much as he knew. However, what we got was still disappointment. He said that he really did not know the inside story. The reason was that the last director, Jin Shaozhou, was, according to him, "extremely shrewd," even to the point of personally receiving the toothbrushes and soaps left behind by the patients, and even changed his nephew's name to Wu Chuandong to handle everything in the hospital. Therefore, although Chen was a clerk, he actually could not manage anything. To find out the details of this matter, it seemed that we had to track down Jin Shaozhou, who was in hiding.</p>
<p>After leaving Mr. Chen Yunzhou's place, we felt the difficulty of finding clues, and it seemed that we would not be able to complete the task. However, because the results of inquiries from the above places all said that the patriotic youths who were brutally killed by the enemy military police at that time were buried at the foot of the mountain outside the North Gate, although we were already very tired, we still held the lucky psychology of hope and cheered up to set off towards the North Gate to make a final attempt. Along Luotuo Bay, after making several turns, relying on Supervisor Gao's familiarity with the city's paths, we passed through a farm at the foot of the city (the farm is now only a name, with only weeds and countless charity tombs). Soon, the North Gate appeared in front of us. Walking out of the city gate, we saw National Army soldiers and police wearing helmets standing on the bridge outside the city gate. The bridge was engraved with the words "August 7th Bridge." It is said that in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the 87th Division of the Army had been stationed there, and the bridge was built by the division in cooperation with the people.</p>
<p>This is Without Thinking</p>
<p>Turning left after crossing the bridge, we saw a teahouse at the foot of the mountain (later we learned that the teahouse was called Shanlouju). A table of villagers in short clothes were talking loudly and drinking tea happily. We went up and told them the meaning of inquiring about the Yonemura case, asking if they knew anything. Who knew that as soon as we said the words "Yonemura," everyone said in unison, "This guy is well-known in Changshu. He is a fierce devil who kills without blinking an eye." This aroused their interest, and everyone scrambled to ask, "Has Yonemura been caught?" We gave them a definite answer. Then Chief Li asked them if they knew anything about the killing of Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Wen Xingwu, Ye Zhenfei, Yu Zifan, and the other five people. Unexpectedly, they actually satisfied our expectations. It turned out that they were all local "morticians." They sometimes secretly saw the enemy military police killing people. Therefore, one of them said without thinking, "There were many people killed. We know where they were buried. There are more than a dozen places"! This made us change from despair to hope, reminding us of the saying "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you doubt there is no road, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village." So we asked them if they could lead us to find them. They all happily expressed their willingness to be guides. Everyone stood up from the table and accompanied us to set off towards the destination. After about five minutes, we arrived at Tiangegang. They pointed to a pile of raised soil and said, "This is it"! Two of them hurriedly went to get hoes and started digging vigorously. Several people standing beside said, "The enemy's vicious methods are so barbaric that they are simply unimaginable by humans. Now they are finally reaping what they sowed." Their words were filled with grief and indignation. There was even an old man who gesticulated and bitterly condemned the enemy's lack of conscience, showing a posture of anger.</p>
<p>No Head, Loyal Bones Dug Up</p>
<p>Suddenly, we heard the sound of the hoe colliding with something. One of them said, "Be careful, the bones have been dug up. Don't break them"! Before he finished speaking, we suddenly saw a few thick limb bones. Continuing to dig, we dug out more than a dozen large limb bones and ribs, shoulder bones, spine bones, etc., and a mass of decayed hair that had turned purple. Each person's face was imprinted with an indescribable color of grief, indignation, and fear. We asked why we couldn't see the head. Another old woman, about fifty years old, with a floral cloth on her head and a farm tool in her hand, said, "I heard that a total of two people were killed in this hole. One was beheaded, and the other was stabbed to death. The head that was cut off was taken by the military police to present to their superiors. The other head was eaten by wild dogs and other animals because it was exposed outside the soil. So there are only the bones of the body in this hole, and there is no skull." We were horrified to hear the woman's words. We took two photos of the bones that were dug out and asked the people next to us to use a bamboo dustpan to hold the bones of the two heroes who died for the country. According to them, the deaths of these two unknown heroes were three years ago. It was already four o'clock in the afternoon. We asked the diggers to go and dig up the burial place of Hu Jiadong's bones that they knew about. That place was at the foot of Mount Yu, not far from Tiangegang, densely covered with unmanaged mountain grass. People walking inside only showed their chest and above, making the situation even more desolate.</p>
<p>Next to a chestnut tree, we found the soil heap of Hu Jiadong's loyal soul. According to them, Hu Jiadong's mother had come here to dig up her son's remains in May this year. She dripped blood on the bones of the skull, but because it was not absorbed by the bones, she thought it was not her son's remains. She cried so hard here that she almost died! This made everyone feel as if a basin of cold water had been poured on them. This so-called dripping blood is the most unreasonable ancient testing method, and it can be said that there is absolutely no accurate grasp, because how can the bones dug out of the soil absorb wet blood? This method has added so many grievances to the world. Suddenly everyone stopped talking, and a blood-stained head was clearly presented in front of them, standing upright in the mud hole. Even with more than a dozen people in the field in broad daylight, everyone could not help but feel a little scared.</p>
<p>The Buried Alive Like Pulling Wood Piles</p>
<p>As usual, the head and feet of the corpse are on the same plane, and the head is always facing the sky, but this remains is very different, with the head up and the feet down in a standing state. It was tightly taken out of the soil, like pulling out a wooden stake. Looking closely at the appearance, it still seemed like a living person, but a few front teeth were missing. The teeth grow inside the jaw, and there is no reason to be missing alone. It must have been knocked down by the enemy military police. There were also a few old farmers, holding bamboo-stemmed pipes in their hands, and couldn't help but burst into tears, making everyone speechless. It is said that in the spring and summer of 1943, the enemy military police indiscriminately arrested patriotic youths and innocent civilians, and the number of deaths was in the hundreds. Hu Jiadong's death was like this: the enemy military police dug a hole, then pulled him over and told him to run down into the hole and stand there. The enemy military police put bayonets on the guns and stabbed him desperately. They only heard a "Ah" sound, and he fell straight into the hole. This is a report from a farmer who witnessed it from afar inside the wall. Then they went to a place called Zhangjiafen. The villagers said, "There is also a corpse here, who died around the same time as Hu Jiadong. The enemy tied it up with a cattail bag before burying it." We stopped and dug again. Less than a foot deep, we found another skull, also inserted straight into the mud.</p>
<p>Bringing Skulls On The Train</p>
<p>The scene was miserable enough, coupled with the wasteland, the setting sun, the dry trees, and the crows returning to their nests, we really couldn't bear to dig anymore. Therefore, we asked the villagers to carry these skeletons to the County Government first. The people who saw it along the way were blocked, which can be said to have caused a sensation throughout the county. That night, the pile of human bones was stored in Huiri Temple.</p>
<p>The next day, after consideration, we decided to return to Shanghai first. We would go back to excavate when necessary in the future. The two skulls and human bones that had been dug out were packed in cattail bags and carried all the way to Shanghai by car and train. If the people who were on the same train with us knew that we were carrying skulls and bones, they would not know what kind of shocking jokes would be made! Now, the skulls and human bones have been placed in the Military Tribunal, and will soon become powerful evidence in the retrial of Yonemura Haruki.</p>
<p>After the excavation, the villagers, Supervisor Gao of the County Government (standing behind the reporter), and the reporter took a group photo.</p>
<h3>Meteorological Observation: Recent Developments in Zhejiang Province's Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Province's meteorological observation work is being managed by the Water Conservancy Bureau's Meteorological Observatory this year. It is divided into seven meteorological stations in Songyang, Yongkang, Longyou, Pingyang, Qingyan, Tiantai, and Yuqian. Due to budget constraints, the two stations in Tianhe and Pingyang are temporarily suspended. The observation items include temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind force, cloud cover, cloud type, cloud direction, rainfall and rainfall time, evaporation, visibility, and weather conditions. The Hangzhou Headquarters also measures air pressure and sunshine hours, and all records are compiled and sent to the Central Meteorological Bureau for reference. As for rainfall stations, there are currently seventeen locations in Longyou, Shouchang, Qingtian, Jiangshan, Xianju, Jinyun, Huangyan, Ninghai, Ruian, Taishun, Yuhuan, Wenling, Yongjia, Yueqing, Yongkang, and Linhai, which are managed by the county governments of each county. Regarding water level measurements, they were previously handled very well, but during the Anti-Japanese War, all were suspended. After the restoration, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan allocated funds to the Water Conservancy Bureau to handle them on their behalf in May of this year. First, five stations were established at Zha Kou, Gongchen Bridge, Haining, Linhai, and Yongjia. Preparations began on June 1st, and the three stations at Zha Kou, Gongchen Bridge, and Haining were officially established on July 1st and began observation. The remaining two stations will also begin work soon.</p>

<h3>Itemized Voting on the Italian Treaty: Molotov's Speech at the Peace Conference Yesterday; Firmly Advocating Comprehensive Understanding and Rejecting the Formation of Confrontational Blocs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 9th (Broadcast): The Paris Peace Conference continues to discuss the Italian Treaty today and is expected to be completed tonight or by the latest tomorrow night.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 9th (Urgent Broadcast): In today's plenary session of the Peace Conference, by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions, Article 3 regarding the Italo-Yugoslav border in the American Treaty, and Articles 17, 18, and 19 regarding special provisions for determining the border between France and Italy were passed. The articles regarding the Italo-Austrian border were passed by a two-thirds majority of 10 to 6, with 1 abstention. The articles concerning the Italo-Yugoslav and Italo-Greek borders were also passed without opposition.</p>
<p>Further Report: The conference unanimously passed Article 4, Clause 11 of the Italian Treaty regarding special provisions for the Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as Clause 12 of the same article regarding the Greek island of Dodecanese, and Clause 13 regarding the nationality of people in ceded territories.</p>
<p>Further Report: The conference unanimously passed Article 5, declaring that the Italo-Yugoslav joint committee will determine the border line between the two countries. Furthermore, Yugoslavia's proposed amendment to Clause 16, which defines the boundaries of the Free Territory of Trieste, was rejected by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions.</p>
<p>Further Report: Poland's proposed amendment to Articles 14 and 15, which prohibit the employment of Fascists in military institutions and government agencies, was rejected by a vote of 10 to 9, with 2 abstentions. Yugoslavia's proposed amendment to the draft for determining the boundary line of the Free Territory of Trieste was also rejected by the conference by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions.</p>
<p>Further Report: The American proposal regarding the status of Trieste was passed by a vote of 14 to 6, with 1 abstention. The provision in the treaty placing the territory of Trieste under the control of the Security Council was passed without opposition.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The chairman of the plenary session of the conference, Soviet representative Molotov, delivered a speech today in a sparsely attended session, lasting 30 minutes. Molotov praised the cooperation of the Four Powers, reiterating the Soviet Union's firm commitment to comprehensive understanding and rejecting the policy of forming confrontational blocs. Molotov stated that cooperation among the Four Powers is more reliable than the United Nations organization, and this is the key to all difficulties. The divisions found at the conference are artificial in nature, and all representatives should act with understanding and sincerity to establish lasting world peace. The United Nations won the victory over Fascism at a great cost, so there is a need to establish a permanent organization. We have learned a lesson from the 1919 peace settlement (referring to the Treaty of Versailles after World War I), believing that this peace must be democratic and treat those who sacrificed for the common cause equally. If the peace settlement is democratic and lasting, it must ensure the elimination of Fascism and encourage the growth of democracy everywhere. Although Italy is the cradle of Fascism, the Italian Treaty is not harsh. The entire text of the treaty was approved by the Four Powers and unanimously passed by the conference, although criticism from various parties was unavoidable at times, but such criticism may not be justified. The passage of various amendments has not greatly changed the original draft, which shows that the cooperation of the Four Powers has been quite effective. However, where the Four Powers disagreed, the conference also failed to reach a unanimous solution. Nevertheless, the cooperation of the Four Powers should be maintained. It is said that the conference is divided into opposing blocs, but the Soviet Union opposes any division and insists on establishing comprehensive understanding. The so-called Slavic countries' desire to establish an anti-British and American front is not true. Such an attempt may have existed many years ago, but there is no such danger at this time. Currently, young democratic countries have risen from the land of Eastern Europe, and these countries only seek fair and legitimate treatment, with no ambition. Some diplomats are attempting to organize a Western bloc, and the invitation of India, China, and Abyssinia to participate in the bloc is surprising. The purpose is nothing more than to obtain more votes in the conference. In short, all countries should value understanding and sincerity to build a democratic peace. If some countries do not want to dominate others and can reach an agreement on some points, then a democratic peace can eventually be implemented.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] Molotov, at the plenary session of the conference, opposed the French proposal for the Free Territory of Trieste, which had been passed by the Italian Political and Territorial Committee, arguing that the status of the Free Territory should be similar to that of the Free City of Danzig after World War I. Molotov pointed out that adopting the French proposal violates the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, as it places too many restrictions on the legislative assembly of the Free Territory and grants the governor too broad powers. Molotov also demanded that the conference determine the date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The plenary session of the conference meets three times a day, and the representatives are exhausted. At the fifth meeting last night, only 30 people attended. The representatives seemed to have little interest in the progress of the meeting, and the general impression was that everything had already been decided, and continued discussion was futile. However, Yugoslav representative Benes continued to argue that the Italian Treaty was unfavorable to Yugoslavia and threatened that if the Italo-Yugoslav border line were divided according to the French proposal, Yugoslavia would refuse to sign the treaty. The representatives of the Slavic countries applauded enthusiastically, but the British and American representatives paid little attention. The head of the British delegation, Alexander, was fast asleep? The meeting continued this morning, chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The New Zealand representative spoke, urging all countries to be optimistic about the future of international relations and not to be unnecessarily apprehensive.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Provide Information on Overseas Troop Deployments at the Request of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 9th (Broadcast): The US government today telegraphed Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, requesting his approval of a State Department plan. The Soviet Union had previously requested in the Security Council that the United Nations members explain their troop deployments in non-enemy countries. It is understood that the United States will support the Soviet proposal, but not in the Security Council, but in the United Nations General Assembly, as no country has veto power in the United Nations General Assembly. In addition, there is a condition that all countries must explain their troop deployments and locations in foreign countries, whether non-enemy or former enemy countries, and for how long they will be stationed. In this way, Moscow must declare the number of Soviet troops stationed in Korea, Central Europe, and the Balkan countries, and the length of their stay.</p>
<h3>British Air Minister Appointed Chief Representative to Attend the United Nations General Assembly</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington] The White House announced that the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the 23rd of this month. It has not yet been decided whether President Truman will attend to deliver the opening address, but it is expected that if the President cannot attend, he will send an opening speech to the General Assembly to be read on the spot.</p>
<h3>French African Mandate Territories to Be Placed Under United Nations Trusteeship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 8th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced today that the French government has submitted a plan to place the two French mandate territories in Africa, Cameroon and Togoland, under the trusteeship of the United Nations. According to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly should approve all relevant agreements regarding the old League of Nations mandate territories.

<h3>Sovereignty of Ryukyu Islands Should Belong to China</h3>
<p>Views of Senior US Officials</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] US diplomatic officials frankly expect the Soviet Union to demand the takeover of the strategically important Ryukyu Islands. According to senior officials who spoke privately to the Associated Press, the United States will oppose this Soviet action, arguing that if the sovereignty of the Ryukyu Islands is transferred, it should be handed over to China, or the islands should be placed under United Nations trusteeship with China solely in charge of administrative affairs, to which the United States would agree. The Ryukyu Islands divide the Pacific high seas and the Yellow Sea, and Dalian and Lushun, which are of great interest to the Soviet Union, are located at the end of the Yellow Sea. In some respects, the situation of the Ryukyu Islands may be compared to the situation of the Dardanelles Strait, as the Soviet Union has long sought to gain access to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3>Britain Reaffirms Commitment to Cooperation on United Nations Control of Atomic Energy; Atomic Energy Bill Passed by Parliament</h3>

It was passed on second reading in the House of Commons, the first major meeting of the British Parliament since the summer recess. Attlee stated that Britain considers the use of atomic bombs illegal. He said, "We hope to ban the use of atomic energy for military purposes." The Prime Minister also revealed that the British government's atomic energy test site costs approximately 30 million pounds, and further increases will be necessary for continued development.</p>
<h3>British Troops Will Remain in Greece</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Undersecretary of State Mayhew stated in the House of Commons that the British troops stationed in Greece were originally scheduled to begin withdrawing, but due to the renewed conflict in the country, especially in the north, Foreign Secretary Bevin could not make a final decision on the withdrawal of British troops.

<h3>Appeals of Sixteen Nazi War Criminals All Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 9th (Urgent Broadcast from Berlin): After an hour and a half of review this morning, the Four Power Control Council rejected all applications for clemency from Göring, Frick, Rosenberg, Streicher, and others.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Indonesia Appointed Minister Without Portfolio</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] The Chinese-language newspaper "Chung Hwa Pao" commented on the appointment of Chinese national Tang Baoguang (transliteration) as Minister Without Portfolio in the Indonesian Republic, stating that this matter should not be regarded as a propaganda move by the Indonesian side. The plight of Chinese nationals in Indonesia has attracted worldwide attention, so this move by the Indonesian government is a sincere expression of its intention to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] The Sino-Indonesian Conference was held in Jogjakarta, inland Java, and resolved that Chinese schools in Indonesia may continue to be controlled by Chinese nationals, provided that the principles of the Indonesian Republic and public safety are not compromised. The Indonesian government also expressed its willingness to subsidize Chinese schools with housing and equipment. In addition, it was resolved that the Indonesian government should recognize the Chung Hwa Association as an organization representing the rights and interests of Chinese residents.</p>
<h3>British and American Memoranda to Turkey Reject Soviet Control of Straits</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The memoranda submitted by Britain and the United States to Turkey both rejected the opinion expressed in the Soviet note to Turkey that the Black Sea Straits should only be controlled by countries bordering the Black Sea. The British and American governments exchanged views on the recent note submitted by the Soviet Union to Turkey. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, US Secretary of State Byrnes, and the British and American Foreign Ministries have all held informal meetings on this matter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Propaganda Targeted Parts of the Soviet Far East</h3>
<p>Soviet Prosecutor Continues to Present Evidence Yesterday</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East convened today. Soviet prosecutors continued to present evidence proving that Japan was promoting Pan-Asianism both domestically and abroad. The evidence included excerpts from books, magazines, and newspapers, and even the covers of certain books. The court-appointed defense attorney for the accused, Lu Gang, strongly objected. Presiding Judge Webb declared that the court had set a precedent for the presentation of such documents because they had evidentiary value, but they must be related to the accused, otherwise the court would naturally not consider them as evidence. Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Rosenblit stated that the Soviet Union believed that such propaganda was aimed at the Soviet Far East.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union only presented the cover of the book "Southern Advance" this time. The cover was a map with Tokyo at the center, drawn as a circumference. The western periphery extended to Lake Baikal and to the northern part of Northeast China, including the Soviet Maritime Province. The southern part included the Hawaiian Islands, eastern Australia, and New Zealand. The southeast included Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and India.</p>

<p>Double Tenth National Day</p>
<h3>Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters' Sentiments on National Day</h3>
<p>Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, issued an article entitled "Sentiments on National Day," consisting of two thousand words. It first described the causes and consequences of the Xinhai Revolution, then discussed the purpose of the National Revolution, which was to build a modern country internally and strive for independent status externally. It continued by describing the process by which Japanese imperialism obstructed China's independence movement, which ultimately led to the all-out War of Resistance. Although eight years of arduous struggle finally resulted in a glorious victory, the post-victory period was marked by widespread war, frequent internal strife, widespread disasters, blocked transportation, stalled production, soaring prices, public unrest, and declining social morality and order. He couldn't help but lament this situation. He hoped that all sectors of the municipal party and government, as well as people from all parties and factions and all citizens of the city, would embrace construction in stability and unity in solidarity, reverse the declining trends, uphold justice, stabilize order, stabilize the economy, and develop production. He particularly hoped that the Chinese Communists would leave a glimmer of hope for the nation's future and the people's lives, immediately cease their attempts to use force as political capital, abandon their policies of seizing cities and territories, and resolve all disputes through political means. Then, they could implement reorganization and unification to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army and democratizing politics, in order to complete the mission of national rejuvenation. Finally, he hoped that everyone would reflect on the decades of arduous struggle, learn from it, and gain a deeper understanding of the current responsibility of nation-building, so as to overcome difficulties with all their strength, strive forward, complete the great cause of nation-building, and achieve a strong and democratic new China.</p>
<h3>Concealing the Assets of Traitor Xie Baosheng: Wife and Accomplices Await Sentencing After Trial</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Xie Baosheng, a gangster who previously opened the Xianle Dance Palace, the Kader Bathhouse, and the Xinzha Inn in this city, was arrested after the victory because he had served as the Deputy Director of the Police Department of the Puppet Jiangsu Province during the enemy-puppet period. He was sentenced to two and a half years by the High Court. After Xie was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau, his wife, Zhu, feared that the property would be confiscated, so in October of last year, she telephoned Wang Chaoliang, the manager of the Xinzha Inn, to relay instructions to her accomplices Li Laoqi (i.e., Li Yongrui), Shi Liangchun, Chen Xueyun, Qiu Youxin, Jiang Fengrong, and others to move the mahogany furniture and other movable property from Xie's residences on Weihaiwei Road and Changping Road to the home of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, who was related to her children by marriage, for safekeeping. The next day, Dai learned of the situation and, fearing accidents, immediately ordered them to be moved out. Zhu and others then moved the items to a rented house on Muirhead Road to conceal them. The authorities learned of this, sealed them up, and the High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted everyone on suspicion of concealing traitorous property. Zhu confessed that these were her private belongings, while the others claimed that they were moving the items on the orders of the owner and did not know that it was illegal. The case was concluded yesterday, and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month. In addition, Xie's eldest son, Xie Wenyuan, who served as the captain of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, is also one of the defendants in the case and is currently on the run to avoid punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hao, Tutor to the Traitor Chu Minyi's Children, to Be Sentenced on the 16th</h3>
<p>Zhang Hao, a native of Nanjing, is 26 years old. He served as a tutor to the children of the traitor Chu Minyi and as a foreign affairs secretary in the puppet Political Security Bureau. When Chu served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he followed him as an interpreter. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. The High Court concluded the trial yesterday and also scheduled the sentence to be pronounced at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th.</p>
<p>Two more cases were concluded on the afternoon of the same day:</p>
<p>Guo Renjie is 52 years old and a native of Changzhou. The prosecutor's indictment stated that in the autumn of 1940, the traitor organized the "East Asia League China Comrades Association" in Nanjing to show that the East Asia League was one of the pseudo-government's national policies, and unveiled the three guidelines of political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication to respond to the "Greater East Asia Doctrine." On December 1, 1941, the "East Asia League China General Association" was established in Nanjing, followed by the establishment of branches in various regions. Guo then served as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai branch of the association, promoting this absurd doctrine. In the spring of 1944, he also served as the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Airplane Donation Movement Committee. All the promotion of the committee's affairs and the collection of donations were designed by him. He ordered various trade associations to apportion airplane donation funds, sent personnel to forcibly sell slogans to various merchants, and attached a donation of ten yuan to each fabric purchase certificate distributed to citizens. He also organized charity performances and ball games to solicit donations, and encouraged gambling dens and opium dens to donate funds, which fueled the arrogance of the enemy and puppets. After the victory, he finally went into hiding. He was detained and brought to justice by the Songhu Garrison Command. The defendant denied in court yesterday that he had served as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the "East Asia League China General Association Shanghai Branch," claiming that he had never heard of this association. He claimed that he only took the empty title of chief of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Airplane Donation Movement Committee in order to obtain an identity card for business travel, and that he was only responsible for general affairs such as receiving and dispatching documents. He claimed that the fundraising was handled by the Liaison Section, and the slogans were handled by the Propaganda Section.</p>
<p>Rong Jiajun once served as an investigator in the Fifth Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. He was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yichang Silk Shop on Shandong Road in this city, together with Luo Jinghe, the puppet section chief. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. The High Court sentenced him to five years in prison. Rong refused to accept the sentence and appealed. The Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. He claimed in court yesterday that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted, but was a gift voluntarily offered by the shop. He claimed that the accusation was due to personal grudges and that he was greatly wronged. He said that if it was true, he would be willing to accept the death penalty, and he wept bitterly. The sentences for both of the above cases are scheduled to be pronounced at 2:30 p.m. on the 16th.</p>
<p>Wu Jianchong was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy-puppet Hunan Gendarmerie. The High Court previously sentenced him to eight years in prison. After appealing, the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. After an investigation yesterday morning, the judge ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The High Court will be closed for one day today for National Day.</p>
<h3>Liquidation of Traitorous Assets</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Traitorous Assets Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau believes that the verdicts of some traitors have been finalized, and traitorous assets need to be actively processed and sold through bidding.

<h3>The Land Administration Bureau is Preparing to Return Land Illegally Seized by the Enemy and Puppets</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Administration Bureau has begun investigating and sorting out the land illegally seized by the enemy and puppets. Those that are needed by the government, such as the existing airfields, will be expropriated with compensation for the land price. For those that were valued during the enemy and puppet occupation, the compensation will be calculated and issued based on the land price index.</p>
<h3>Customs Seizes a Large Amount of Silver</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Anti-Smuggling Section of the Jianghai Customs, based on confidential reports and in conjunction with the police局, recently searched a building at 611 Zhongzheng East Road in this city and found a large amount of silver, worth more than 100 million yuan. The main culprit, Li Dawei, has fled after hearing the news, and only his wife, Li Zhang, was arrested. According to her confession, the silver was transported by her husband from Tianjin and intended to be sold on the black market in this city to obtain huge profits.</p>
<h3>Japanese Resident Indignant, Reports Enemy Gendarme Fujii Masa</h3>
<p>Fujii Masa二, 33 years old, from Okayama Prefecture, Japan, who is being held in the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense, served as a patrolman, guard, and judicial officer in the North Shanghai Gendarmerie before Japan's surrender. A Japanese resident, Izumi Shigeru, heard that the suspect had abused and massacred kind merchants and farmers during his work in Nanhui in 1942, and had also extorted large sums of money from merchants in the North Shanghai Gendarmerie. Out of indignation, he reported him to the office. After several investigations, the suspect stubbornly denied everything, but it was determined that the crime was serious. It is reported that the suspect was transferred to the military court of the First Pacification Area Command on the 9th of this month for investigation, and the office will continue to conduct investigations and collect evidence. The person in charge of the office told reporters that if any civilians have been poisoned or harmed by enemy gendarmes, they should submit evidence and detailed accounts of the facts to the office for verification and handling.</p>
<p>[Also reported] Regarding the 23 Japanese prisoners of war, including Tanaka Masao, who were escorted from the Northeast to Shanghai, the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense escorted them to Nanjing for filing. They have now been ordered to be escorted back to the Shanghai reception center for detention. It is reported that Tanaka and others were escorted back to Shanghai on the 4th of this month. It is understood that Tanaka and others are not actually war criminals, but were captured by the Communist army, and were recaptured by our army in the Battle of Sipingjie, so they were escorted to Shanghai.</p>

All true friends of China should support this kind of assistance. We have no intention of jealousy or competition.

<h3>New UNRRA Director Huo Baoshu Elaborates on Future Work Guidelines, Willing to Work Hard to Improve Several Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The new UNRRA Director Huo Baoshu held his first press conference after taking office at the Capital Hotel on the afternoon of the 　th. First, Tian Boli, the acting director of the UNRRA Translation Department, gave a brief introduction.</p>
<p>Huo then delivered a speech, saying: UNRRA is an organization that serves the people, and it is also an organization that seeks relief and reconstruction for the country. It needs a lot of assistance from all sectors of society. I am willing to have more contact with all parties. UNRRA is open to everything. I hope to use your power to make the society know the work of our people. UNRRA has laid a good foundation in the past under the leadership of Mr. Jiang Tingfu. Mr. Jiang is a transcendent talent and a great scholar. He is not only the creator of China's first national post-war relief plan, but also through his efforts in the United Nations Conference, made China an important member in creating the UNRRA. I only hope to continue to complete the task on the foundation he has laid.</p>
<p>In the past, there have been criticisms of UNRRA at home and abroad. Some of them are reasonable and should be remedied, and some misunderstandings should be explained. Some people think that UNRRA is not efficient enough and cannot transport materials quickly. In fact, after eight years of war, China's transportation has been greatly damaged. Even the transportation capacity of the Huangpu River is not as good as before, so it is difficult to give full play to efficiency. Moreover, the materials that China has obtained are not much more than those obtained by Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia and other countries. Given the size of China and the size of its population, the proportion obtained is actually very small. It is very difficult to satisfy all parties under this kind of situation.</p>
<p>The living standard of the Chinese people has always been quite low, and they have suffered a lot during the war, but UNRRA can only help the most urgently needed refugees. It cannot be like Santa Claus, sending gifts everywhere!</p>
<p>I cannot make any guarantees at the moment, but I hope to deal with this limited amount of material fairly. My colleagues in this office have been earnestly retained by me, and I sincerely hope that they can use the heart of a Bodhisattva to benefit the victims. However, I am determined to strengthen its organization within UNRRA, so that everyone can do their best and fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Only one point can be announced today: From now on, I will definitely distribute materials under the principles of impartiality and great fairness, and speed up the work. We will always strive to reduce costs, because saving a penny will provide a penny more relief to the victims.</p>
<p>Huo finally said with confidence and a pleasant tone: I study economics, and I have studied transportation issues carefully in the United States and in China. Therefore, I am determined to improve transportation with my knowledge and experience, so that efficiency can be increased, and I have recently worked in the Bank of China and have had a lot of contact with all parties, so finance must also be improved.</p>
<h3>Everyone Can Perform Magic Tricks, But Each Has Different Skills: Mr. Huo Smiles as Reporters Ask About Finances</h3>
<p>Mr. Huo then answered questions raised by reporters in a very harmonious atmosphere. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Question: Does UNRRA still intend to sell materials? Answer: UNRRA's sale of relief materials is based on the basic agreement signed with the UN. Compared with other countries, the proportion sold is very small. But there are many ways to remedy the financial situation. In fact, selling materials is not the only one. Details will be announced in the near future. (2) Question: Will you consider asking for foreign assistance with transportation in the future? Answer: The use of ships should be decided by the government. I cannot answer this question about other government agencies today. But it is naturally best to use more Chinese things. (3) Question: In the current situation where the domestic situation is not completely stable, does UNRRA intend to consider revising the original relief procedures? Answer: Relief is universal. If the car cannot actually drive there, it should change its route. The current UNRRA is trying its best to make the routes smooth and negotiate with the parties concerned. (4) Question: General Chennault previously suggested cooperating with UNRRA to establish an airlift team. What is the progress of this matter? Answer: There are three principles of transportation: fast; cheap; safe. In addition, it should meet the needs. The Chennault airlift team matter is currently under consideration by the competent authority. As of today, I have not heard of any decision. I believe the government will have instructions on this matter. (5) Question: Does Director Huo think the airlift team is necessary? Answer: UNRRA feels the need for various means of transportation. (6) Question: It is said that UNRRA has paid Mr. Chen one million US dollars in advance. Is this true? Answer: I have not seen this document. (7) Question: UNRRA has established many offices in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists. Do you intend to continue to add more in the future? Answer: The offices in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists continue to work. Whether to set up new offices will depend on the needs.</p>
<p>After the meeting, reporters inquired with Director Huo about the specific measures to solve UNRRA's financial problems. Director Huo replied with a smile: "Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills!" His expression was free and easy, which showed that he had a plan in mind; and the fate of tens of millions of starving victims lies in Director Huo's "magic trick."</p>

<h3>Adding Buoys and Repairing Docks: Port Affairs Meeting Sets a Deadline for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee held its second meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 9th) in the City Hall conference room. The following resolutions were made: (1) The English name of the Port Reorganization Committee was decided to be "The Port of Shanghai Readjustment Commission." (2) The proposal to add buoys was approved. Because the original eighteen Class C buoys were unsuitable for ocean-going vessels to moor, ten Class A buoys will be exchanged for them in the original area. Ten Class C buoys will also be laid in shallower waters to prepare for coastal and river vessels. (3) In order to solve the problem of congested berths, the committee will separately notify the responsible persons of each unit to repair the docks within a limited time to facilitate the berthing, loading, and unloading of merchant ships. (4) According to committee member Ding Guitang: during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the docks had long been neglected from dredging. Foreign ships can only dock and depart after waiting. Dredging should be carried out urgently to facilitate navigation. As a result, it was resolved to hand this issue over to the Dredging Bureau to conduct a detailed survey of the water level of each dock and submit it to the next meeting for a decision.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhao Zengjue, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, proposed that the city's wharves and nearby warehouses be managed by area and group to achieve unified command and rational utilization. It is proposed to divide them into: (1) Shallow water group: based on the wharves and warehouses in the Nanshi district. (2) Deep water group: provisionally divided into three areas: Puxi Outer Ocean area, Puxi Near Sea area, and Pudong area. In the future, it can be expanded from Jiangwan to Wusong River and connected to the Jinghu Railway to facilitate the transfer of domestic and foreign materials. (3) Professional group: such as coal, fuel, military, etc., will be divided into groups according to their professional needs. As for how to manage and how to divide, it is proposed that the committee members study in detail and submit their opinions to the group for collation and then submit them for formal discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Same Name, Entangled Affairs: Old Man Pan Injures a European; Old Man Cai Takes the Blame for Another</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday heard a case of assault. The defendant, Old Man Cai, was acquitted in court because he was mistaken for someone with the same name and took the blame for another. It turned out that in Maodeli, Xikang Road, No. 25, there lived two people named Old Man Pan and Old Man Cai. Old Man Cai lived in the front building, while Old Man Pan lived in the back building. The residences of the two old men were very close. On July 26th of this year at a certain time, Old Man Pan quarreled and fought with a ten-year-old girl named Meigendi in the same alley over using tap water. Although Old Man Pan was old, he was still strong and injured Jiang Gendi's head. Old Man Cai, because of his neighborly friendship, came forward to mediate, but to no avail. After being questioned by the Xinchengzhi Branch Bureau, he was transferred to the District Procuratorate, which sent him to the court for prosecution. However, when Jiang Gendi gave her statement, Old Man Pan and Old Man Cai were entangled and unclear. The Procuratorate did not listen carefully and mistakenly filled in Cai Laobiao instead of Pan Laobiao. Yesterday afternoon, the court opened, and Cai Laobiao was unjustly tried, shouting grievances. The plaintiff also stated in court that this Old Man was not that Old Man. Since the court knew that the defendant was mistaken and could not start the trial, it declared Cai Laobiao not guilty. If Jiang Gendi still wants to sue Pan Laobiao, she needs to follow the legal procedures and file a new statement.</p>

<h3>Ticket Scalpers Active Again at the Station; Black Market Tickets Inflated Twofold</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, passenger transport on the Jinghu and Huhu railway lines has become crowded again, and it is even more difficult to buy tickets. The long queues of ticket buyers at the North Station, Qiujiang Road Business Office, and China Travel Service have reappeared. Ticket scalpers selling black market tickets are also active again. It is estimated that about one-tenth of the tickets on the Jinghu and Huhu lines are in the hands of scalpers every day. In particular, reserved seat tickets are mostly purchased by scalpers. Reserved seat tickets are sold the day before, so they have more time to resell them, and passengers prefer to take reserved seats, so they are easier to sell. Scalpers often linger near the North Station and, when passengers enter the station, they rush forward and ask in a low voice: "Want tickets? Want tickets?" The price they sell is about one to two times the ticket price. Ticket sales at the North Station begin two or three hours before the train departs. The China Travel Service sells tickets for the next day. The railway authorities have worked hard to crack down on scalpers, but with little success. They are now actively discussing effective measures with relevant parties.</p>

<h3>Zhou Zhiqiang Falsely Claims to Be Unmarried; Tao Yumei Deceived and Loses Her Virginity</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Tao Yumei, a local woman, 22 years old, was engaged to Zhou Zhiqiang, the son of Zhou Mengxian, the manager of the Chishaoduo Auto Shop on Xikang Road, in Shanghai on November 26, 1945, and the lawyer Pan Renxi was the witness. At that time, it was agreed that the wedding must be held before the end of May this year. Zhou also agreed. Since the two were engaged, they did not avoid suspicion. In January this year, when they traveled to Suzhou together, they had physical relations. Afterwards, Tao was anxious to get married, but Zhou kept perfunctorily procrastinating, claiming that he was setting up a silk company and that the wedding could be held as soon as the business developed slightly. Tao Wangmei initially believed it to be true, but later discovered that there was no such thing as organizing a company, and began to suspect. Later, she found out that Zhou Zhiqiang already had a wife and children before she knew she had been deceived. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to sue Zhou Zhiqiang under Article 229 of the Criminal Law for using deception to make a woman mistakenly believe that he was her spouse and obey his adultery. Two civil lawsuits were filed, demanding compensation for losses of 20 million yuan. Yesterday, the District Court opened, and Miss Tao came to court in a black cheongsam with her lawyer and another female friend.

<h3>Gauze and Cloth Transportation to Southern China to Begin Tomorrow: Textile Management Committee and Customs Administration Have Received Government Orders; Items Include City Cloth, Colored Cloth, Fine and Coarse Twill; Total Amount is More Than 5,000 Red Pieces</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The six regulations on the management of gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China and the eight regulations on the application and review procedures were first seen in this newspaper on October 8. It is now known that the Textile Industry Management Committee and the Customs Administration did indeed receive instructions from the Executive Yuan a few days ago, ordering them to be implemented on a trial basis. It is reported that all gauze and cloth transported to Southern China from various places are subject to these British regulations and procedures. The Textile Management Committee and the Customs Administration will jointly announce them for two days starting tomorrow and will implement them starting tomorrow. As for the handling procedures after implementation, according to inquiries made by reporters, they are recorded as follows: (1) The Textile Management Committee will first handle the registration of gauze and cloth manufacturers. The committee will obtain a registration form, which focuses on the date of establishment, financial status, organizational situation, average monthly production and sales volume, and monthly purchase and sales volume of gauze and cloth, and machine equipment. (2) The Textile Management Committee will approve the qualifications of each registered manufacturer. Once approved, a gauze and cloth factory registration card for transportation to Southern China will be issued. (3) Each manufacturer holding a registration card, if they want to transport gauze and cloth to Southern China, must first fill out an application form for an export permit for gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China. The application form must indicate the destination of transportation to Southern China, the name of the product, the name of the producing factory, the trademark, the number of pieces, the packaging, the length of each piece, the net weight, the total value, the name of the shipping vessel, and the date of export. After receiving the application form, the Textile Management Committee will issue a receipt. (4) After the application form is approved, the Textile Management Committee will issue an export permit for gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China. The permit is in four parts. The contents of each part are roughly the same as the items listed on the application form. The first part is the reporting and verification part. The gauze and cloth that the manufacturer transports to Southern China will be approved for release after being inspected by the customs based on this part. After the goods arrive at the destination, this part will be handed over to the commissioner of the local Textile Management Committee for registration. The second part is the type A notification part. After the Textile Management Committee issues the first part, it will send the second part to the exporting customs at the same time, so that the customs can hold it for verification. The third part is the type B notification part. The Textile Management Committee will send it to the commissioner of the Textile Management Committee in the gauze and cloth importing area for collection, so that it can be verified when the gauze and cloth arrive at the destination. The fourth part is the file keeping part, which is collected and stored by the Textile Management Committee.</p>
<p>Monthly Export Quota</p>
<p>Regarding the monthly quota of gauze and cloth allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai, the Textile Management Committee will base it on the domestic sales and import figures of gauze and cloth in various places in Southern China (including Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou) in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, and calculate and stipulate it according to the ratio of the current total domestic gauze and cloth production to the total domestic gauze and cloth production before the war. (1) In terms of total production, there were 5 million spindles in operation in China in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China. Currently, there are less than 2.5 million spindles in operation in China. Currently, there are less than 1.7 million spindles in operation in the Shanghai area (i.e., the various member factories affiliated to the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association). (2) In terms of the quantity of cotton yarn transported to Southern China from the Shanghai area in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, the average annual quantity was 104,736 pieces, and the average monthly quantity was 8,728 pieces. Therefore, the current monthly quantity of cotton yarn that should be allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai should be 8728×250/500×170/250=2987 pieces. (3) In terms of the quantity of cotton cloth transported to Southern China from the Shanghai area in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, the average annual quantity was 2,669,885 pieces, and the average monthly quantity was 222,490 pieces. Therefore, the current monthly quantity of cotton cloth that should be allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai should be 222490×250/500×170/250=75647 pieces. This amount of cloth is calculated based on an average of 12 pounds of fine cloth, which is equivalent to 2,269 pieces of cotton yarn. (4) From the above calculation, it can be seen that the total monthly amount of cotton yarn allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai is 5,236 pieces, accounting for about 7% of Shanghai's cotton yarn production. It can be seen that the quantity is very small and will not affect the supply in this city.</p>
<p>Bond Market Stability</p>
<p>The bond market situation is stable and consistent, with transactions of approximately 5 million yuan in face value. The "Tong Bing" bonds opened at 2,400 yuan this morning. Most of the sellers were still retail investors. The high price was 2,480 yuan. A major investor took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price fell to 2,250 yuan in the middle of the day. Before closing, the price stabilized above 2,300 yuan. As a result, it rose 80 yuan compared to the previous close. The A, B, and D bonds each rose 50 yuan, and the "Tong Wu" bonds only rose 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Banking and Money Industries Closed to Celebrate Double Ten Day</h3>
<p>Today (the 10th) is the second Double Ten Day since the victory. All sectors of the city are celebrating enthusiastically. All government agencies are closed for one day. All banks and money houses in the city are also closed for transactions. All money transfers and exchanges will be moved to tomorrow (the 11th). Other public utilities are also closed, while trams and buses will operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise: US Dollars Are Difficult to Develop: Hong Kong Notes Have Been Leveled with Hong Kong Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Because the price of gold in Guangdong and Hong Kong was higher than that in Shanghai, the buying interest was quite strong yesterday. It opened at 2.23 million in the morning. After opening, it was still peaceful, and the price hovered around 2.22 million for a long time. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 180 bars at a price of 2.225 million. After that, it gradually became stable. The Chaoshan gang had a lot of arbitrage buying, and people's hearts were more firm. Demand exceeded supply, and then it rose. Near noon, it rose to 2.238 million, and then there was some pressure. At noon, it stood at about 2.23 million. In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made, and it was still firm. As a result, it was 18,000 yuan better than the previous close. Jewelry was listed at 36,000 yuan. Silver was flat, and silver dollars were slightly more expensive. The informal short-term lending market was loose, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5% to 1.8%.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market is trending well. The US dollar is still quoted at 3,500 yuan to 3,550 yuan, but there are no transactions. The informal market transaction price is slightly better, at about 4,200 yuan to 4,300 yuan. However, transactions are extremely difficult to develop because of the strict investigation in the Sichuan Road area. As a result, compared with the previous close, they have all recovered. Hong Kong notes replaced them. Demand exceeded supply, and it rose another 30 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate and Hong Kong notes have already been leveled. It was passively raised to 940 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,140 yuan. The British exchange rate rose from 14,700 yuan to 15,000 yuan for sale. The official exchange rate of the US dollar has not changed, and there are no transactions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee Established: Evaluation Methods Drafted by Three Trade Associations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that cotton cloth is a major commodity for people's livelihood. The market price has recently skyrocketed, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, it established an organization to set the price of cotton cloth in Shanghai. The first committee meeting was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. The attendees were Committee Members Gu Bingyuan (Social Affairs Bureau), Pan Shihao (Municipal Commerce Bureau), Wu Weijing (Textile Construction Company), Liu Piji (Sixth District Mechanical Textile Industry Association), Zhang Zunshi (Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association), and Dong Jiufeng (Cotton Cloth Industry Association). Director Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the significance of reviewing and setting cotton cloth prices. Then, the committee's charter was amended and approved. The Sixth District Mechanical Textile Industry Association, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association were entrusted to draft (1) cotton standards, (2) cotton cloth costs, (3) wholesale profits, and (4) punishment methods for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The cloth market was calm yesterday. The price stabilized as short-term lending rates eased. However, sales to merchants were slow, and the purchase of goods that Textile Construction Company had lowered the price of for sale the day before was not enthusiastic. The transaction price of hand-made goods was similar to yesterday. The leading fine cloth was still 84,000 yuan, the Wufu cloth fell to 77,500 yuan, and the white printed Biji was 88,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Indian Cotton Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bombay, 8th] The Indian government is currently trying to promote the import of Indian cotton to Japan. It is planned to export 300,000 bales this year, and it is expected to be shipped in November. It is hoped that the quantity allowed for export next year will be even larger.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Digests Stagnation: Japonica and Indica Rice Both Decline</h3>
<p>The supply of rice in the market is abundant, and the registered amount of goods from merchants totaled more than 11,000 shi. Digestion is stagnant. Japonica rice fell by 2,300 yuan, and the price of Japonica rice in the central region also fell by 2,300 yuan. However, Baiyuan rice is still firm. There is no market for wheat flour. Oil prices fluctuate. Vegetable oil is stagnant, and the price is down by a small 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil is stable. Raw oil digestion has become active, and stores are taking the opportunity to buy in, and the price has rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly by 100-200 yuan. There is no trading in wheat bran. Because another 9,000 packages of soybeans from the Northeast will be imported tomorrow, people's hearts have softened. It is also heard that the Northeast is also shipping directly to Southeast Asia, so the sales in other ports are not moving, and the price has risen by 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>South African Woolen Cloth and Serge Arrive in Shanghai for the First Time After the War: Totaling More Than 9,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The James Swinton, managed by the Burma Line Shipping Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with more than 9,000 tons of woolen cloth, serge, wool yarn, and woolen products loaded from South Africa. It is currently docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong for unloading. This huge amount of woolen products is the first import after the war.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise by 100,000: Official Yarn Allocation Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The yarn market saw a surge again yesterday. Because short-term lending rates eased, and a Cantonese ship was departing on Friday, the Cantonese merchants came to purchase again, and the Hankou merchants also had a buying appetite. At the opening of the market in the morning, prices rose sharply. 20-count yarn rose by approximately 60,000 to 110,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 42-count and 32-count fine yarn were not willing to fall behind. With weaving factories searching for allocated raw materials, they jumped by as much as 135,000 yuan. However, if sales to merchants cannot be active, then the market price can still stabilize. The official allocation price of cotton yarn remains unchanged. 20-count yarn is still 1.55 million yuan, and 42-count yarn is still 1.89 million yuan. Dyeing and weaving factories registered from numbers 1 to 400 and received allocations, including 503 pieces for private enterprises (sold at half of the requested amount) and 962.5 pieces for Textile Construction Company. The date for the next yarn opening has been changed to the 13th due to the National Day holiday today.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Gradually Becomes Quiet: Exported Aged Tea Has Too Much Mold; Foreign Firms' Inspection is More Stringent Than Before</h3>
<p>The tea market situation is extremely narrow for both local and merchant sales. However, the earthen tea factories are still interested in Qimen fragrant tea. According to overseas telegrams received in recent days, the foreign firms' tea market has received all the varieties that were shipped. However, the quality is not good, and there is too much mold, so they have instructed to pay more attention in the future. Overall, the current situation is that Chinese tea is in a very dangerous situation, and if flash goods are dumped overseas again, the future will be even more dire. The tea merchants in this city, in view of this, are more cautious in their selection. Therefore, the results of yesterday's market inspection mostly failed to meet the requirements. The number of transactions has decreased, but the price of 34-year-old aged top-quality Qimen tea is still firm at 220,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Has a Surprise: China Cement Reaches Limit Up</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was highly anticipated by all parties yesterday, but the major investors remained inactive. Therefore, it was unable to support the recovery before closing. Short-term lending rates gradually eased, and the off-market price was already high. Therefore, each stock opened high in the morning, and the market weakened after opening and gradually returned. Half an hour later, the situation was the most tired. Subsequently, retail buyers continued to maintain it, and the price was pulled up in the middle of the day. Yongsha rose to 825 yuan, and Maya was 4,560 yuan. Among the small stocks, except for Qinxing, the rest, such as Xinguang and Jingfu, failed to exceed the opening price. China Cement quietly rose from 198 to the limit up. China Feng had its own buying interest and strived to move upward. The two major hot stocks stopped rising from high prices after 11:20 AM. Soon, they gradually declined. Before noon, there was a lot of competition to sell, and the off-market supply was active. Hot stocks fell to low prices, and the market turned around before closing. As a result, Yongsha rose by 3/10 compared to the previous close, Maya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Xinho each rose by 1/10. Tongyi, Zhongfang, Datong, Innerwear, and Jinglun rose slightly. New Asia Company, Lian'an Match, were flat. Rongfeng, Zhongsih, Wuhe, and Huafeng each rose by 3/10 to 5/10. China Cement rose by 10%. The total transaction volume was 11.17 million shares. The off-market prices of each stock were more tired than rising.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market, except for the two major hot stocks that could still be supported, the rest all retreated. Small stocks were even worse. As a result, Yisha and British Union rose slightly, and Jardine Matheson, Yeguang, and Yipi fell slightly. Paper, shipping, and steel fell by 5/10.</p>
<h3>Overdue Business Tax: Direct Tax Bureau Stipulates Payment to Treasury by the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarded a notice from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stipulating the location and deadline for the payment of business tax due before the end of June this year, and sent a circular to the various trade associations to be forwarded to their affiliated businesses for compliance. The two regulations are recorded as follows: (1) All businesses that have business tax due and unpaid before the end of June this year, whether investigated by this bureau or continued to be assessed by the Finance Bureau, should hold the payment slip together with the tax payment and pay to the city's treasury. If the business tax payment slip was issued by the Finance Bureau, a stamp with the words "This payment is for the national treasury" should be affixed to identify it. This is the tax payment before June, which should be paid to the national treasury. For those whose business time is after July this year, the business tax payment should be changed to the city treasury for collection. (2) Furthermore, the overdue business tax payments for the last winter and this spring and summer seasons that were limited to be paid to the treasury before September 25 have not yet been paid by many units. Or because the deadline was too tight, the merchants were unable to raise the funds in time. Now, the deadline has been extended to October 20. If it is overdue again, a penalty will be imposed according to law, and no leniency will be granted.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises Sharply Again: Factory-Processed Silk Goods Also Rise Prominently</h3>
<p>Rayon prices rose again yesterday. In the morning, the price of 120-count rayon on Tianqiao Road was quoted from 3.95 million to 4 million yuan. In the afternoon, because tomorrow is a National Day holiday and the payment must be made the day after tomorrow, the price was quoted at another 100,000 yuan higher, with the middle price being 4.05 million yuan. It is necessary to wait for the China Textile Corporation to increase the allocation of rayon before there is hope of suppressing the price. Otherwise, the number of each manufacturer's shortage will inevitably be purchased in the black market, creating an opportunity for those who hold the goods to raise the price. The price of factory-processed goods in each store yesterday was about 50,000 yuan higher, but the transaction volume was quite small. Silk goods were tight yesterday. Huajin silk was traded in the market for 3,000 yuan for the medium quality and 3,100 yuan for the heavy quality in the morning. In the afternoon, because the raw materials were slightly better, the former was traded for 3,050 yuan and the latter was traded for 3,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Transactions Decrease</h3>
<p>Because today is Double Ten Day, transactions in the sugar market were lighter yesterday. The trend was slightly soft. The association's listed spot price for 20-count medium sugar was 141,000 yuan at first, and then 138,000 yuan. Raw sugar was 122,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan. Numbered goods included more than 200 baskets of Guangbang-opened two thin sheets of Shimen sheets in green, with prices ranging from 90,000 yuan to 88,000 or 9,000 yuan. Lingxing transactions of Jianbang green tea were made at a price of 108,000 yuan. The oil gang's input and output were limited, and the price lacked ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Longan Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Large miscellaneous-grade longan are rare and the sales volume is very strong, so the price is gradually rising. The market rose by more than 10,000 yuan again yesterday. There is no hope of easing for the time being.</p>

<p>Publishing World</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading Newspapers</h3>
<p>— A Critical Voice</p>
<p>I remember that a certain newspaper supplement once published a special issue, inviting several "well-known people" to write articles to guide readers on how to read a newspaper well. They told us what conditions a good newspaper should have. But we know that the main material in a newspaper should be news, and this news should be objective reporting.</p>
<p>Objective reporting is not an easy thing to do. The same thing will cause different reactions in people with different standpoints, and their reports cannot escape the shadow of this reaction. So we can frankly say that all reports have a bit of subjectivity. So it is not unforgivable that the news recorded in a newspaper cannot be completely objective. However, some people deliberately use certain things as an excuse to boast and exaggerate, so as to distort the facts and confuse the public. This is a conscienceless act and is absolutely not desirable! As for the editors' selection of materials, although they have their own objective standards, they cannot avoid a subjective attitude. Different people have different opinions, and it is not possible to force them to agree. However, some gentlemen deliberately choose to publish some confusing news as their main task, which is a loss of the reporter's duty.</p>
<p>All of this can be ignored, but at least we should be able to find some news and read some news in a newspaper. But recently, we often see that most of some newspapers are "editorials," "reader opinions," "special reprints," and even the speech drafts of certain "experts"! Although we do not necessarily require it to be a "good newspaper," at least we can require it to be a "newspaper"!</p>
<p>This reminds us of two questions: the skill of propaganda and the identity of reporters. Those who are skilled in propaganda do not care about opening their mouths to scold. We must know that although ordinary people like to hear others scolding people, they will also feel annoyed if they hear too much scolding. As for those engaged in journalism, they are not spokespersons for political propagandists. They should maintain a sense of justice and a detached attitude, otherwise, they will lose the identity of a reporter.</p>
<h3>On Mr. Gu Chunfan's "China Industrialization Plan"</h3>
<p>— Pingfan</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Chunfan's "China Industrialization Plan" proposes a five-year plan for our country, referencing the planned economy of the Soviet Union, the controlled economy of Germany, and the guided economy of the United States and Britain. It advocates implementing a mixed economy, with meticulous detail and unique ingenuity. Among recent works on China's industrialization, it is arguably unmatched since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan." If we want to see Mr. Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood realized, this book is certainly the best reference, especially in today's era of rampant bureaucratic politics and bureaucratic capitalism. To vigorously promote economic construction, he advocates minimizing the portion of industries directly operated by the state; the executing mechanism should adopt the publicly-owned company system common in Europe and the United States; and in terms of management, the government should guide more than control. We find his intentions very thoughtful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the set of policies he advocates to be coordinated, such as slightly taxing the land of large landowners or their excess land rent, balancing ordinary income and expenditure, stabilizing the internal and external value of legal tender, stabilizing prices, strictly controlling issuance policies, reducing imports while increasing exports in trade policy, and stabilizing wages in line with prices, etc., are unlikely to be implemented as long as peaceful unification cannot be achieved. However, these are all political aspects, which the government can readily implement with determination. Only the conditions for successful industrialization mentioned by Mr. Gu in the end are the most awkward problem, and are most relevant to the future of China's industrialization. We would like to discuss them briefly as a critical friend.</p>
<p>Regarding the conditions of the industry itself, we will leave it to the international economy to supplement and will not mention it for now. We believe that the most important issue that cannot be left to natural selection is the problem of "the choice and preservation of traditional culture." What exactly should be chosen? What should be preserved? According to Mr. Gu: "Western industrial civilization and our traditional civilization are absolutely incompatible. The Western spirit of courage, diligence, and striving for high and great achievements is contrary to our stagnant civilization of contentment, humility, and yielding. If we want to industrialize, we must adopt this industrial spirit." He also said: "If we want to industrialize, we must reform the entire society, the entire culture. In terms of morality and thought, we must adopt the Western attitude of courage, diligence, earnestness in everything, emphasis on rights, and public morality. We must not stubbornly adhere to the traditional attitude of self-preservation, ambiguity, muddling through, and carelessness... Our inherent philosophy and inherent morality are precisely the philosophy and morality of an agricultural society. There are indeed many aspects that are valuable and worth preserving, and will be preserved. However, it is impossible to manage industrialized production with the spirit of an agricultural society and agricultural production, as Mr. Fu Sinian said, 'dragging four thousand years of garbage to catch up head-on'... Because society is a whole set, it must be completely changed. To industrialize, to plan, we must eliminate all hereditary constraints of agricultural society." There are three points in these paragraphs: First, society is a whole, and if it is to be changed, it must be completely changed; second, China's traditional civilization is a civilization produced by agricultural society and is not suitable for managing industrial production; third, there are also many things worth preserving, "If we cannot correctly understand the choice... then the process of industrialization will naturally cleanse away the unsuitable stains in the civilization and retain other harmless traditional ways of life."</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, it is true that modern sociologists mostly recognize that society is a whole organic body, but the universal principle that "all changes are gradual and not sudden" is still a valid principle. Any change in an organic body is slow, changing part by part. As long as it is on the road to improvement, it will always move forward. Looking at the industrial countries of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Russia, each has its own style; we can see that the situation of social reform is not consistent and cannot be rigidly said to be completely changed. If it is handled too hastily and one speaks of being thorough at every turn, it is indeed pleasant, but if the conditions for reform are not coordinated, the result is destruction without construction. This is a common phenomenon in societies ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, which is undeniable. So-called sudden changes and creations are only occasional exceptions and cannot be forced.</p>
<p>The second point is also true from the perspective of people with a materialist conception of history. They apply Marx and Engels' method of explaining Western social history to explain China's social history. But is China's social history the same as Western history? Is this method of explanation correct? We agree with the "unity of mind and body." We do not think that the idealist view of "all phenomena are created by the mind" is in line with the truth, and we dare not agree with the materialist view that all spiritual civilization is built on an economic foundation. Without talking about philosophy or citing extensive sources, just from the perspective of materialism: societies of the same nature should produce civilizations of the same nature. Why, from a historical perspective, are the civilizations produced by agricultural societies in various countries not the same? Isn't it obvious that the emergence of a civilization must contain other factors and not entirely rely on the economy? Our country's "Zhou Li" and "Guanzi" are the oldest books in the world on controlled economy, and most of what they say is about the policies and systems of the industrial and commercial sectors. Could this also be an agricultural civilization produced by an agricultural society? To take a step back, agricultural civilization does not necessarily hinder the liberation of industrial productivity. Was not the British industrial revolution developed from an agricultural society? If it is said that agricultural civilization tends to be conservative, England is the most conservative nation in the world, and it is also the most rapidly progressing nation in the world. Which of the new tricks in politics, economics, and society today was not initiated by it? Western civilization since the eighteenth century can be said to have been led entirely by it. If it is said that modern industrial production is related to the French Revolution of Human Rights and the American Revolution of Independence, then Germany has never had any Revolution of Human Rights or Revolution of Independence. Its politics, economics, and society all have their own set of theories. How did it also industrialize, and even surpass others? There is no other reason than the development of science education. With the development of science education, an agricultural society can also be transformed into an industrial society; otherwise, no matter how much reform is carried out, it will not help economic construction.</p>
<p>Then, are there any things in Chinese society that hinder the development of science education? If so, what are they? In other words, what are the traditional civilizations of [missing word]? Mr. Gu originally wrote another book, "Industrialization and Chinese Civilization," which is said to be unpublished. We cannot guess what he said. Judging from the traditional civilizations pointed out in this book, it is probably the moral thoughts of the Buddhist and Taoist schools. Taoism advocates non-action, does not value the worthy, avoids wisdom, and does not value rare goods. It also advocates knowing the white and guarding the black, knowing the male and guarding the female, and not being the first in the world. This kind of thinking is purely negative. Therefore, it regards knowing when to stop, knowing contentment, yielding, and humility as virtues. It regards self-preservation, ambiguity, muddling through, and carelessness as the secrets of life. When applied to politics, it becomes a policy of fooling the people. When applied to economics, it becomes a small-scale, self-sufficient policy of not interacting with each other until old age and death. Although Confucianism also speaks of humility, it values the worthy. Therefore, its humility is to respect and yield to the worthy, and "when it comes to benevolence, one does not yield." Therefore, it still has a positive and constructive significance for society. It is not like Taoism, which uses retreat as a way to advance and takes giving as a way to take, all out of hypocritical and insidious calculations. Confucianism also speaks of self-preservation, but not entering dangerous countries and not living in chaotic countries refers to not being in a position of power. If one is in a position of power, one should act bravely for what is right, even sacrificing oneself for righteousness. It cannot be confused with the Taoist's single-minded "harmonizing with the light and assimilating to the dust" and "floating and sinking with the world." In short, Chinese society has been dominated by the negative thoughts of Buddhism and Taoism for more than two thousand years, which is very common and very deep-rooted. Therefore, traditional culture stagnated very early and changed its nature. Confucianism is just placed aside as a show. Since the Qin Dynasty, the true Confucian doctrines have never been applied once. The Thirteen Classics are just tools for scholars to seek fame and wealth. Some superficial people still insist that Confucianism is the orthodoxy of Chinese social thought, unwittingly acting as a shield for Buddhism and Taoism. Some enthusiastic reformers believe that old culture is all created by Confucianism, and that to reform old culture, they must overthrow Confucius and overthrow Confucianism. This is extremely unfair. What I want to say today is to clearly point out the Buddhist and Taoist theories that have been hiding behind and dominating my country's social, economic, and political affairs for thousands of years, so that everyone knows that if we want to talk about reform, we must first reform the negative spirit of Buddhism and Taoism. This spirit not only holds back my country from evolving, but also unconsciously makes us go backwards. If we do not get rid of it, how can we think of developing productive forces?</p>

<h3>Memories of the Double Tenth</h3>
<p>— Juefei</p>
<p>A northern autumn morning, the crystal clear and warm sunlight shines on the Western Hills. The side that receives the sunlight shows a reddish-brown color, while the side that the sunlight does not reach is a dark purple; it reminds people of the light ochre landscape in Chinese paintings, and the subtlety of the brushwork can truly capture the charm of nature. "The grass in Jiangnan does not wither at the end of autumn," and it can also be seen in the wilderness of Youyan. The leaves of the willows are a little withered and yellow, and the sorrowful wind of the night has scattered some on the ground, but in the morning light, they have regained their graceful dancing waists. As for the thick and strong locust trees, they are not easily moved by the wind, and still maintain their lush and verdant appearance. The autumn scenery around the Double Ninth Festival is always like this. It makes people feel the passage of time and evokes endless past events.</p>
<p>This year's Double Tenth Festival was embellished in such scenery. It was clearly the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and Li Yuanhong had just been reinstated. On this morning, a military parade was held in the barracks of the West Garden. Since the victory of the First World War in the seventh year of the Republic of China, a celebration military parade was held under the presidency of Xu Shichang, but years of internal strife had long prevented such a formal gathering with international etiquette. Moreover, since the Hongxian Imperial Restoration Movement, the legitimate status of the Beijing government had been shaken, and there had been no opportunity to formally invite foreign guests to commemorate the National Day. Presumably, the uniforms of the military police were worn and old, the carriages and horses of the officials were not complete, and it was necessary to find a special way to issue a sum of money for the ceremony from the salt surplus. Li was supported by Wu Peifu and reinstated. Before taking office, he sent a telegram with the condition of abolishing military governors and disbanding troops. Li's reinstatement could symbolize the end of the previous National Protection Movement and the opposition to Yuan Shikai, and for a time, people felt that he was coming later and getting better. His first cabinet, headed by Wang Chonghui, once co-signed the article "Our Political Propositions" with Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shi in "Endeavour Weekly," which was greatly praised by good people. This time, the National Day was especially struggling to embellish it, which was a comfort to everyone. However, while embellishing, a political storm had already occurred, and the Wang cabinet was shaken by the Cao faction, and Li's political destiny had been determined. His formal attendance was the first and the last time; not only him, but the National Day military parade of the Beijing government never appeared again.</p>
<p>The past is still clearly before my eyes. Li's stalwart and solid body, his humble and dignified attitude, were even more suitable for appearing in this kind of scene. When he stepped into the parade ground, he must have been recalling the old dream of Wuchang eleven years ago. The commander-in-chief this time was Wang Huaiqing, who was old. Li rode on a white steed and set out for the inspection. The President's pennant led the way in front, galloping freely, raising his hand to salute from time to time, and the black feather crown on his head turned up layers of snow waves in the breeze. This kind of black feather is soft and drooping, and is very precious. Among the other attendants, only the feather crowns of diplomats and Mongolian nobles were pure white curly hair, and the senior military and police officers only had silk tassels. This group of people's military uniforms were probably only worn once again when Zhang Zuolin took the position of Grand Marshal.</p>
<p>This was the barracks of the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Guards. The Cloud-Dispelling Hall of Longevity Hill and Wangquan's Pagoda stood tall on the right, and the ruins of the Old Summer Palace stretched across the left. The stone slabs on the driveway had been trodden by countless horses' hooves, and the branches of the trees waving in the wind had seen off countless crowns, robes, swords, and pendants. I often silently pondered this in the shadow of the setting sun.</p>

<h3>Wuchang Uprising Anecdote: Was Li Yuanhong Dragged Out from Under the Bed?</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>In the year before the founding of the Republic of China, on October 10th, the revolutionary patriots launched an uprising in Wuchang. At that time, it was very much like a leaderless group. For the position of governor, according to the status of the revolutionary party at that time, Liu Gong, as the general manager of the Progressive Association, was more suitable, followed by Sun Wu and Jiang Yiwu, but they were either injured and stayed in the hospital, or could not take office due to traffic obstruction. At that time, some people focused on Li Yuanhong because the party members who launched the uprising at that time were from the grassroots, and they were afraid that it would be difficult to call on the people. Li was a Qing army general and was well-liked by the soldiers. Supporting him as the leader seemed to be the choice of the moment. Therefore, the situation creates heroes (?), and Li Yuanhong took advantage of the opportunity, so he was supported as the governor. Li also had a smooth sailing because of this, from governor to vice president to president.</p>
<p>Why do we say that Li Yuanhong's appointment as governor was taking advantage of the opportunity? Because Li was not a revolutionary party at all, and had absolutely no understanding of revolutionary doctrines. He was only forced out and relied on the opportunity to muddle through in the politics of the Republic of China for more than ten years, earning the nickname "Li Bodhisattva." Obviously, we can see what kind of person Li was.</p>
<p>Speaking of Li's origin, it can also be a laugh. What exactly was it like? In many historical events, he was dragged out from under the bed in his house. As Wen Gongzhi's "Revolutionary History of the Republic of China" (reprinted in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China) says:</p>
<p>"At that time, the revolutionary army still had no leader (Sun Wu was injured and had not recovered due to manufacturing bombs in Hankou. The leaders who stayed in Shanghai could not reach Hubei for a while). It was proposed that Li Yuanhong, the commander of the new army, should be the leader. Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei went to Li Yuanhong's residence. Li was under the bed. Zhang Zhenwu found him and forced him to come out as the governor, otherwise he would be shot to avoid disturbing the hearts of the new army. Li Yuanhong had no choice but to reluctantly agree..."</p>
<p>This clearly says that Li was under the bed and was forced out by the party members. Zou Lu's "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang" (first edition in the 27th year of the Republic of China, reprinted in the 33rd year of the Republic of China) says the same thing as Wen Gongzhi, with minor differences, such as: "After the three towns of Wuhan all fell into the hands of our army, a plan was made to organize a military government.</p>
<p>"...Liu Gong was in Hankou and could not cross the river in a hurry. The Huang Yu, etc. who were invited had not arrived yet, and a candidate could not be found urgently. Liu Gengzao said: 'Commander Li Yuanhong is now in the city. If it is suitable to choose him, we should guide him.' Everyone agreed. Cai Jimin led a few comrades to go with Liu. Li heard the noise and hid under the bed in the room. Cai and others took him out and supported him to the Consultation Bureau." Just looking at these two paragraphs, they are already different. Wen Gongzhi said that Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei went to Li's residence, while Zou Lu said that Cai Jimin led several comrades and went with Liu Gengzao. Although the people who went were different, Li hiding under the bed was the same. In the past twenty or thirty years, whether in books or in oral transmission, almost everyone said that Li Yuanhong was hiding under the bed in his own residence and was dragged out by the party members. This kind of writing or oral transmission is mostly hearsay and not a writing by someone who personally participated in this battle. It is inevitable that there are other effects, or that it is passed on by mistake, and it becomes a joke in the founding history. Now let's excerpt the writings of the party members from Hubei who are also veteran comrades who participated in the revolution in the two lakes, which is naturally more credible. Cao Yabo's "True History of the Wuchang Revolution" (published in the 19th year of the Republic of China) says:</p>
<p>"...After a while, Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying reported that Li Yuanhong, the commander of the 21st Mixed Brigade, was still in Wuchang City, and they had a bodyguard of Li Yuanhong who came as proof. Wu Zhaolin then ordered Ma Rong, Cheng Zhengying, etc. to lead a platoon of soldiers, guided by the captured bodyguard of Li Yuanhong... Ma Rong, Cheng Zhengying, etc. led the team to Liu Wenji's house in Huangtupo, first surrounding the house before and after, and then breaking into the door. The momentum was turbulent. Liu's bodyguard asked what they were here for. The crowd said they were here to invite Commander Li. The bodyguard did not dare to point the way and did not answer. So the crowd went straight to the bedroom to search. At this time, Li Yuanhong had lost his mind, and his anxious state was revealed in his expression..."</p>
<p>This says that the party members who went were Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying, guided by Li's bodyguard to Liu Wenji's house, not Li's residence, and Li was not hiding under the bed, only saying that he was searched in the bedroom. Hu Zushun, a party member who participated in the Wuhan Uprising, wrote "Sixty Talks About the Past" (published in June of the 33rd year of the Republic of China) saying:</p>
<p>"At that time, it was almost dawn. First, Xiong Bingkun sent Tang Qifa to lead a detachment to patrol the area around Zhonghe Gate. He caught sight of someone carrying a leather suitcase coming out of the residence of Li Yuanhong, the commander of the Mixed Brigade. Qifa and others suspected that he was a robber and stopped him. They asked where he came from and where he was going. They learned that he was Li's cook. Li ordered him to take it out and move it elsewhere to hide it secretly. After repeated questioning, they learned that Li had fled to the house of his staff officer Liu Wenji in Huangtupo. Qifa and others had visited Li but could not find him, so they followed him. Li happened to be sitting and talking with his executive officer Wang Anlan, etc. Seeing Qifa and others suddenly arrived, he was caught off guard and, without asking the reason, he was startled and said: 'I, Li, have always been kind to the army. Why do you come to plot against me!' The crowd said: 'No, we are not here to harm the commander, but to invite the commander to come out and preside over the overall plan.'" According to this, those who went to Liu Wenji's house were not Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei, nor Cai Jimin and Liu Gengzao, nor Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying, but Tang Qifa. The location was not Li's residence, but the home of Li's staff officer Liu Wenji. Tang Qifa went after getting a clue from patrolling. He did not report to other fellow comrades, and invited Li out. When he met Li, Li was talking with Wang Anlan and was not hiding under the bed in his own residence. Among the narratives, Hu Zushun's writings are more detailed. Hu was a cadre who participated in this battle, and this statement is more reliable. Zhang Nanxian's "Record of Knowledge of the Hubei Revolution" (published in November of the 34th year of the Republic of China) was published last among the party histories, and Zhang was a comrade who participated in the Wuhan Uprising. The book says:</p>
<p>"...Provincial Councilor Liu Gengzao (zi Xiaochen, from Baokang) said: 'Commander Li Yuanhong is now in the city. If it is suitable to choose him, we should guide him.' Everyone agreed. Cai Jimin led a few comrades to go with Liu. First, Ma Rong and Tang Qifa patrolled the streets and saw a servant carrying three leather suitcases out of Li's residence. They suspected that he was a bandit and questioned him. The servant claimed to have been ordered by Commander Li to come and fetch them. They asked where the commander was, but he did not dare to answer. After being forced to ask, he agreed to guide them to Liu's house in Huangtupo, pointing out where Li was. Li heard the noise and hid in the room. Ma Tang urged him to come out. Li shouted and came out, saying: 'I have led troops for more than ten years, and I ask myself that I have treated you well. Why are you making things difficult for me!' The crowd said: 'We have no malice, we are asking the commander to come out and preside over the overall plan.' Li said: 'There are many talented people in the revolutionary party. What do you need me for?'..."</p>
<p>Zhang's narrative is roughly the same as Hu Zushun's. The only difference is the number of suitcases carried by the servant, one and three. Hu said that Li was talking with Wang Anlan when Tang Qifa and others suddenly arrived. Zhang said that when Tang Qifa and others arrived at Liu's house, Li hid in the room. Whether he hid under the bed was not mentioned, only saying that Ma Tang and others urged him to come out.</p>
<p>From the above statements, it seems that the reason why the revolutionary party members looked for Li Yuanhong to take office as governor was to use Li's prestige in the new army at that time to facilitate calling on and commanding the troops. As for Li being forced out, it was not in his own residence, but in the home of his staff officer Liu Wenji, which is credible. Who went to find him, it is more credible to compare Ma Rong, Tang Qifa, and Cheng Zhengying. When Tang and others arrived at Liu's house, Li heard the noise and hid in the room in a panic, which is also reasonable. Because Li refused to come out of the room, Ma Tang and others urged him to come out. The meaning of "urged" is very subtle.</p>
<p>In short, Li Yuanhong was not a revolutionary party member. When he encountered the revolutionary party members' uprising, he thought of escaping and hiding. Even when he was supported to Chu Wangtai, he said: "You are making things too noisy. How can this be!" (See "Record of Knowledge of the Hubei Revolution") When the crowd asked Li to issue an order to fight, Li said: "Although the Governor's Office has fallen, Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao are on the run. Once the land and water forces attack, there will be no reinforcements and no food and salaries. Are you prepared? I once studied the navy. If warships such as the Haiqi are used, Wuchang can be completely destroyed with just three cannons. You don't know the pros and cons. I advise you to go back to the camp and rest, and discuss it again." (See "Sixty Talks About the Past") These are all counter-revolutionary arguments. Later, Li Yidong took a pre-written proclamation to the people and asked Li to write the word "Li" under the title of Governor, but Li refused. Li immediately threatened with a gun, but Li still refused. Finally, Li wrote it on his behalf in anger and handed it over to the secretary to copy and post throughout the city. Zhang Binglin's "Li Gong Stele" said "...There was no suitable candidate for the commander, and because the public was good at appeasement, they all intended to support the public. It was decided three months ago, and the text was secretly written and signed, calling the Grand Governor Li, but he did not know it." These words were spoken by Zhang Binglin to please him. Although the Wuhan revolutionary party members had a saying about recommending Li Yuanhong as governor in advance, they did not pre-print the text in the name of Li Yuanhong three months ago. Moreover, the word "Grand" was not on top of the Governor. These were all words of praise and flattery in Zhang's tomb for Li.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 58</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Let me first read you a few sentences from a letter; listen," Mr. W pulled out a stack of stationery, flipping through several pages. I had seen this stack of stationery in Changxindian, so as soon as it caught my eye, I knew it was the long letter Yaoqun wrote to Tsurumi: "—Dear Tsurumi, the teacher you introduced to me, although he is a foreigner, seems to know more about our country's customs, military affairs, and politics than the average military and political figure in our own country. He has constantly provided me with insights into the world situation and the current state of our country. Having received his instruction, I believe I now understand where my post is and what my duties are! Dear Tsurumi, humans are certainly emotional beings, but human emotions don't necessarily have to be placed on romance between men and women. There is a lot of work that requires our full enthusiasm. I dare not say this is my new discovery, but I am writing it out now to give you a guarantee; a guarantee that I will never let my emotions hinder your career..."</p>
<p>Mr. W, fearing that I would be impatient to listen further, quickly said, "Listen to these important words below," and emphasized again as he read the letter, "...Dear Tsurumi, I repeat again and again that since you have created me, you must have a use for me. I am now requesting you to give me a task that is not too burdensome. In the Northeast, north of the Yellow River, even Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, I am willing to go. No matter what the job is, even if it's guerrilla warfare, being a spy, enlisting in the army, I am willing to do it, just not willing to be idle with nothing to do..." Mr. W paused here, as if to catch his breath, and then said, "Listen..."</p>
<p>"Dear Tsurumi—if this letter still receives no response, I must first apologize to you—I am preparing to act on my own... In the village, I often heard that Gu Ruzhen in Tong County wants to turn the Hebei area into a second Northeast to please his Japanese masters. I really want to get rid of him. It's just a pity that I've never met him before, and I don't know what he looks like; it will take some time to figure that out... I'm telling you this to let you know how determined I am!"</p>
<p>Mr. W finished reading here, and then carefully and neatly put down that large stack of stationery. He then took out a piece of Japanese-style paper, smiled at me, "The person who wrote this letter probably guessed that. I'll read out the things related to Yaoqun, and you'll probably understand how important her and Hucheng's mission in Tong County is." Saying this, he unfolded Tsurumi's letter, silently read a few lines, and then said to me, "Listen..."</p>

<h3>A Wish</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The cross is the most sacred and solemn symbol; the Christian cross represents greatness, salvation, and sacrifice; the Crusades represent glory and liberation; our National Day, Mr. Wu Zhihui discovered that the date was October 10th in the Gregorian calendar and named it Double Tenth Festival. It is indeed a coincidence, and the two crosses, thinking about it today, do have a double meaning of suffering.</p>
<p>However, "ten" also represents "complete," hence the common saying "ten out of ten, perfect." If we could seize the opportunity during the past thirty-four festivals, work diligently and without fault, and not abandon ourselves to despair, our days would not be so difficult, and the country would certainly be able to achieve prosperity, strength, health, and happiness.</p>
<p>May the days of double suffering from internal and external troubles end from now on, and may we happily celebrate the 36th National Day next year.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Five Years Ago Today, Memories Stir</h3>
<p>— S.S.</p>
<p>Beijing held a national celebration meeting at Liulichang this afternoon.</p>
<p>One hundred thousand people attended. After performing a new revolutionary drama, some young people gathered outside the city gate, holding scissors in wait. Anyone with a queue (braid) had to have it cut off before entering the city, otherwise they would be beaten to death. Therefore, the crowd remained silent, allowing their queues to be cut off. In an instant, the queues piled up into a small mountain, and cheers thundered.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA held a Restoration Commemoration Meeting today. Sun Yat-sen was invited to give a speech, accompanied by the hosts Wu Tingfang, Li Denghui, and Wang Zhengting. After the speech, everyone shouted three times, "Long live the Republic of China, Sun, Sun, Sun!" Then they shouted three times, "Long live the Republic of China, Wu, Wu, Wu!" (referring to Wu Tingfang).</p>
<p>During the lantern parade held by various circles in Shanghai in the evening, in order to reclaim rights, there was a "No Cigarette Smoking Parade" float, with a platform erected on it, illuminated by electric lights. On it, an actor played the scene of someone being arrested by Indian police for "smoking," which was very realistic and shocking.</p>
<p>Military and Civilians Rejoice Together</p>
<p>Today, 16,000 infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers were lined up on both sides of Hadamen Street in Beiping, standing solemnly and majestically all day long. During the military review ceremony, the former Qing Kharachin Prince and Mongolian-Tibetan Lama Bishops were invited to attend. The Inner Mongolian Living Buddha, wearing a yellow robe, slowly rode towards the stage in a large, two-wheeled yellow carriage. The wheels were large and the body was extremely high, resplendent and magnificent, attracting everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Li Yingshi, the "Commander of the Shanghai Defense Army," and Commander Liu Chuanqi of the "Fu Zi Camp" rewarded each soldier under their command with one small ocean coin and suspended drills for one day to commemorate the occasion. At the same time, Mr. Kikurimon, the general manager of the Shanghai French Tramway Company, personally went to the Western District Municipal Hall and said that in commemoration of the National Day, his company expressed its "sympathy" and, considering the congestion of pedestrians, agreed to change the "express trams" to "slow trams" during the day.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Revitalization Company planned to pilot rickshaws in the city starting on National Day, but it was strongly opposed by the citizens' communes of Shangxia Tang in the central city. They all believed that the streets were narrow, and if rickshaws were allowed, each store would have to demolish three feet of their frontage, which was impossible to agree to. They had jointly petitioned the Civil Affairs Director and the Police Bureau to prohibit the operation of rickshaws, and planned to use force as a last resort.</p>
<p>Learning from the Past</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival of the first year of the Republic of China, the "Shen Bao" Free Talk published a short article that is still worth reading despite the passage of time: "What day is today? It is the first National Day of the Republic of China. Colorful flags are raised high, and the whole country is jubilant, but a careful examination of national affairs is truly touching; in terms of domestic affairs, opinions are divided, and people fight among themselves; in terms of diplomacy, the great powers are watching, and recognition is uncertain; in terms of finance, the Agricultural Minister looks up to the roof, and resources are exhausted; in terms of military affairs, there is no way to disarm, and rumors of war are frequent; the people have no sense of patriotism, and there are many rebellious elements in the border areas. The land is scarred, and how can one bear to look back? The road ahead is full of thorns, and how can one not be heartbroken? On this commemorative occasion, there is even more endless sighing. How can one force oneself to follow the crowd and engage in idle entertainment?"</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Dan Gui First Stage is performing Liu Hongsheng's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," the China Grand Theater Wang Youchen, Yu Zhenting, is performing "Losing the Empty City," "Chopping Ma Su," and "Yan Yang Lou," the Great Stage Mai Biyun, Lu Yueqiao, are performing "Cui Ping Mountain," the New New Stage Li Jirui is performing "The Great Guanyin Temple." Not only are there no movies or dramas, no traces of "de di," but also no unsightly gimmicks such as "splitting cotton" and "opera fan families." Everything is hard work; people and customs are declining, and I miss these people with their primitive characters!</p>
<h3>People Should Not Fear Conscription; The Government Should Do a Good Job</h3>
<p>— Li Cun</p>
<p>The revised Conscription Law has been passed in the 308th session of the Legislative Yuan. It stipulates that all men of the Republic of China from the age of eighteen to forty-five have the obligation to perform military service. This matter has already caused fear and unease among many people. The news that "conscription is about to begin" is being spread around! As if a great disaster is about to befall them. In fact, this is not surprising, our compatriots' level of knowledge is too low. Most people have not been able to understand the meaning of the conscription system. On the one hand, because conscription is a system that was established only after the Anti-Japanese War, the time is too short. On the other hand, because the southeastern coastal areas fell very early, conscription has never been implemented at all, and its current implementation is a pioneering effort. It is inevitable that some people will misunderstand. What's more, the worst thing during the Anti-Japanese War was the "eight-year conscription system," so "conscription" seems to be a terrifying topic for most people.</p>
<p>Why Conscript?</p>
<p>First, serving in the military is an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, especially in democratic countries. Since the country belongs to all citizens, then the responsibility of defending the country should naturally be borne by all citizens. The meaning of conscription is to call on every citizen to have a preparation for defending their own territory. Every citizen must first receive military training in order to have the ability to defend their own country.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the current international situation: Although victory has been more than a year, the permanent peace between nations has not been established. On the contrary, the struggle between nations is becoming more and more obvious and widespread. We certainly absolutely hope for permanent world peace, but the facts tell us that this lofty ideal is not easy to realize. It is possible that in the near future, there will be another inevitable bloodshed in the world. Countries without the ability to defend themselves cannot exist in the current situation. We are now conscripting not because we want to invade others, but to defend ourselves. Therefore, it is said that the current implementation of the conscription system is extremely meaningful in this era.</p>
<p>Third, modern warfare is scientific warfare, and all weapons apply the principles of science. Therefore, modern soldiers must have rich scientific knowledge and healthy physiques to be qualified. Our country has always implemented the recruitment system, and only those who have no other living skills are willing to become soldiers. The low level is inevitable. The current implementation of the conscription system is aimed at this drawback. All those who are qualified for conscription must be relatively outstanding citizens. In this way, serving in the military is not only the obligation of a citizen, but can even be said to be the right of an outstanding citizen.</p>
<p>If every citizen can understand the meaning of conscription, they probably will no longer feel fear towards it, but will feel interested in it and enthusiastically respond to the call.</p>
<p>However, having said that, the conscription that starts now must never be as terrible as it was during the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<h3>Cruel and Vicious: The Terrifying Germ Warfare</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>In this extremely dangerous international situation, when everyone is worried about the inevitability of a third world war, some people have predicted that the future war will definitely be a "biological war." Sensitive American writers are frantically imagining biological warfare in the Third World War in their articles.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington reported on the 6th of this month, Fan Weite of the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Corps claimed: "The United States has invented several poisons that are a thousand times more powerful than the poison gas of the First World War to prepare for future biological warfare." Mr. Fan also issued a warning: "If biological warfare does occur in the future, we must not only make defensive preparations, but also make offensive preparations." Although this unsettling news has been mentioned in newspapers from time to time not long ago, it does not feel sudden. But if you close your eyes and think about it, when the Third World War begins, the belligerent countries will use countless cruel and poisonous bacteria to create "artificial infections." One ounce of "germ powder" can poison 180 million people weighing 165 pounds (report to Congress by the U.S. Naval Bureau of Biological Warfare). Such a terrifying number truly makes people sigh, "If the war starts again, humanity will be destroyed."</p>
<p>Legal or Illegal?</p>
<p>However, the interpreters of biological warfare believe that this kind of war is not "illegal," because "infectious diseases are very "natural" and "ordinary" things." Moreover, they loudly proclaim: "Biological warfare is no more "barbaric" than bayonet fighting." That Mr. Fan Weite also said: "I completely disagree with the humaneness of raising weapons. What is truly inhumane is war. If you can make a weapon illegal, you can make war illegal." Whether it is "legal" or not? Whether it is "barbaric" or not? Let's not talk about it. First, let's describe some of the invention history of bacterial weapons:</p>
<p>Everyone knows that both Germany and Japan attempted to use bacteria in warfare during World War II. According to the captured German scientist Schleber at the Nuremberg Tribunal, Hitler once ordered General Goering to prepare for bacterial warfare. The Lange Research Institute was established in Posnan, Poland. Later, due to the continuous advance of the Soviet army, which was close to the German border, the research work could not continue. In the winter of 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services received a report that the country wanted to use rockets infected with bacteria to attack, but it was not realized. Japan also attempted to put a large number of bacteria in paper balloons and "gift" them to the United States, but the result was useless.</p>
<p>Three Years Ago, Research Began</p>
<p>In the spring of 1943, the United States established a special laboratory in Maryland to engage in research on biological warfare. The Navy Department also implemented the "Biological Warfare Program." In the winter of that year, in order to prevent Germany from using bacterial warfare, a mutual factory was established in Indiana to cultivate a large number of bacterial intermediaries. In Berkeley, California, a hidden research laboratory was also established. In June 1944, the Chemical Warfare Department, with the support of the Army Medical Department, presided over the matter, and there was close cooperation from the Navy and Interior personnel. The United States had prepared to use these "well-nourished" bacterial warriors for the final general attack after the atomic bombs were dropped, if Japan still refused to surrender.</p>
<p>According to news currently revealed by the United States: The United States currently has five "germ factories" that can use germs for warfare at any time, with power far exceeding that of atomic bombs. The manufacturing of bacterial weapons is not as troublesome as atomic bombs. Any brewery or university laboratory can engage in it. The cost is quite "economical." The funding for researching bacterial weapons during this war was only below 50 million US dollars in total, compared to the 2 trillion of the atomic bomb budget - it can truly be said to be "cheap and good."</p>
<p>What is the strategic importance of using biological warfare as an offensive weapon? American authorities say it is "unlimited." When this place is attacked, you cannot see them, smell them, or taste them. By the time you slowly begin to suspect, half of the residents of this place have died. Everything from the five grains to living things is of course needless to say.</p>
<p>There are Limits to Use</p>
<p>But in fact, its effectiveness is also limited, because biological warfare weapons are uncontrollable things. They are dangerous to both the aggressor and the invaded. They can only be used as a "last resort" weapon. Moreover, the enemy will not use biological warfare in his own country to deal with an aggressor, because this would endanger his own country with an epidemic.</p>
<p>The progress of science has taken human warfare from primitive warfare using stone tools, knives, guns, cannons, bombs, tanks, atomic bombs, all the way to "biological warfare." Is the great massacre of mankind really unavoidable? We are eagerly seeking peace, seeking that these advanced weapons have "no use for them"!</p>

<h3>"Tough General" Wang Yaowu</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jie</p>
<p>Someone once said: "The two military leaders of Shandong, one is Wang Yaowu, who sits in Jinan, and the other is Chen Yi, who occupies Linyi. They are tough generals against tough generals."</p>
<p>At present, in Shandong Province, only the two most complete territories, Jinan and Qingdao, are under the control of the National Army. Although the rest of the places have National Army stationed there, they cannot be completely controlled. Under this environment, Wang Yaowu sits calmly in Jinan, maintaining Shandong's security, which is truly a thankless task. And the fact that Jinan is still under the protection of the National Army, and the people are spared liquidation, cannot but be attributed to General Wang Yaowu and his heroic brothers.</p>
<p>Regarding the background of the tough general: Tai'an, Shandong, is his hometown. From an early age, he was naturally combative and often took pride in victory. Therefore, he stepped into Whampoa. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he fought from Shanggao to Changde, from Hunan to Jiangxi. He won unprecedented victories in both battles. Before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he created another "Hunan-Western Victory." Therefore, everyone calls him an indestructible and unbreakable tough general. Recently, among China's young generals, he is a remarkable figure. Now, he is the commander of the Second Pacification Zone.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, he was the commander of the 51st Division. After this long Anti-Japanese War, he went from division commander, army commander, deputy commander of the group army, commander of the group army, commander of the front army, all the way to today's commander of the pacification zone. Among the many battles, his most significant achievements were the Shanggao Battle, the Changde Defense Battle, and the Hunan-Western Victory. The success of these three battles fully demonstrated his command ability. All of his superiors and subordinates have such comments: "Bold and meticulous, decisive and composed" is his only specialty.</p>
<p>I remember that after he took over as the commander of the 74th Army, he still respected and revered the former army commander Yu Jishi as he had in the past, and even consulted the old army commander on some important issues.</p>
<p>There is an important condition for winning battles: winning the assistance of friendly forces and close connection. General Wang understands this point very well. In the Hunan-Western campaign, Wang Yaowu benefited from the support and coordination of his friendly forces (Tang Enbo's army) behind him, thus creating a great victory. After each battle began, General Wang paid special attention to reporting the military information he obtained to the friendly forces, and in the telegrams or telephone conversations, he was very sincere and humble, thus gaining the favor of the friendly forces. These are all small details, but they are also his secrets to success.</p>
<p>Today, his position is not small, but he is not arrogant at all. He is very humble in dealing with people. He will not easily use military secrets as an excuse to sell "news secrets" to show off his superior position. Moreover, he will also sincerely ask for advice from general scholars, celebrities, and social elites. It is precisely because of this that makes people have a more profound understanding of him politically, and people call him an all-round military and political general. His life is quite strict. It is said that in his life, no romance can be found.</p>

<h3>"To Establish the Republic, To Advance to the Great Harmony!"</h3>
<p>— Sun Ke</p>
<p>Congratulating the Double Tenth Festival of the 35th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Last year, today, being just the second month after the victory, I once stated the following belief in a National Day commemorative article: The first major event after the victory of the War of Resistance is peaceful nation-building. This is our responsibility to the country and the world, and it is also the most urgent hope of the people of the whole country. Our nation-building undertaking is allowed to succeed, not to fail. It is expected that many unexpected difficulties will be encountered in the process of nation-building, but any difficulty must be overcome, any deadlock must be broken, and any problem must be solved. In the end, only the Three Principles of the People are the basic principles for solving national affairs, and only the interests of the people are the biggest factor in determining national policy. This is my consistent belief that I have always maintained.</p>
<p>Today, the National Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China has arrived again. Under the current turbulent internal and external situation of the country, we are welcoming this annual National Day with heavy hearts. Thinking back, since the founding of the Republic of China by the Founding Father, it has been more than a third of a century. However, the past work of the National Revolution has obviously remained at the stage of nationalism; as for the two major principles of democracy and people's livelihood, they have not been thoroughly implemented to this day. At present, our country, which has suffered so much, is still walking on a rugged and dangerous road. While we are heartbroken, we cannot help but hope that the work of "revolutionary destruction" should come to an end in the future! What the people of the whole country are praying for day and night is to follow the nation-building plan left by the Founding Father internally, and all parties and factions should work together to build a new democratic and unified country. Externally, we should adhere to the principles of the "United Nations," get along with all federal states in a friendly manner, cooperate equally, and ensure lasting peace in East Asia and even the world. This is also the realization of the "Great Harmony World" ideal of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Based on the above two hopes, I deeply feel that today's China is very similar to the United States after the War of Independence. At that time, the United States had just gotten rid of the oppression of foreign forces, and the home foundation was still very fragile, and the relationship between the thirteen states was even more chaotic. Later, the US government and the people were able to adopt peaceful means, and the constitutional conference achieved the goal of unified nation-building. Of course, the political systems and political ideals of China and the United States are not necessarily exactly the same, but their spirit of peaceful nation-building is indeed worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>Look around, now there are fires everywhere within the borders, and the whole country is full of devastation. The people of the whole country are in deep water and suffering. Not only have they not enjoyed the fruits of victory at all, but the sacrifices and losses suffered by the people now are even greater than during the war. What is even more serious is that the failure to resolve domestic political problems has caused China's international status to plummet; at the same time, due to the crisis in the social economy and the corruption of the political atmosphere, it has led to the current phenomenon of the people's livelihood being declining and prices soaring. To solve the current dangerous situation, we can only rely on everyone to wake up and introspect, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, and build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People. This is the only way out for China in the future. If we want the nation-building cause to be completed smoothly, we must first complete democracy and unity. To go a step further: In order to achieve unity, the army must be nationalized and the nationwide war must be stopped. We should follow President Chiang's declaration: "Politics must be resolved by political means" to solve the people's suffering and save the country's crisis. In order to achieve democracy, we must start constitutional government on the one hand, implement the principle of democracy, and embark on the road of a modern democratic country; on the other hand, we must reform politics, implement the principle of people's livelihood, and thoroughly eliminate the forces of bureaucratic capital, comprador class, and local bullies and evil gentry. From today onwards, all parties should concentrate their efforts and strive for peaceful nation-building under the leadership of President Chiang. This is the first point I dare to sincerely hope for. Secondly, from the perspective of the international situation, since the victory of the war, due to the lack of mutual trust and the differences in concepts between the major allied countries, they have lost the spirit of cooperation they had during the war, and have caused the current situation of tension. In particular, the formation of the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union is an undeniable fact, so the horror of the Third World War is attacking everyone's heart again. Some people even believe that the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is on the verge of breaking out and there is no possibility of avoiding it. There are even a small number of troublemakers or blind people who are advocating and expecting another war to break out. Gradually, everyone has a pessimistic attitude towards the future of world peace. I think this mentality and this view are harmful and useless to the clarification of the international and domestic situation.</p>
<p>It should be known that any allied country after the war yearns for peace and hates war. Taking the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as an example, the United States' policy has always been to fight against aggression. Britain, after the trauma of the war, is really unable to protect itself, and has no power to launch a war. The Soviet Union was also exhausted after the war and needed a chance to recuperate. At the same time, there are no irreconcilable contradictions between the major allied countries. Although many differences have arisen in the handling of the defeated countries and territorial issues, and although the future of the United Nations still has to go through many difficult and tortuous roads, I firmly believe that with the wisdom and tolerant spirit of the politicians of the allied countries, they will definitely be able to gradually overcome them. As for those who are looking forward to and advocating the Third World War, they may think that the war can help us solve domestic problems. However, if the next war breaks out, it will be destined to destroy the lives of more than half of mankind and the collapse of culture. No country has any reason to take risks and seek luck. Therefore, we will never hope that the Third World War will happen, especially not in China or the Far East. Moreover, as a weak country, it is simply a fool's dream to want to gain an advantage in international conflicts. There is also a wrong idea that it seems that China's foreign policy has no other way to think of except being pro-American or pro-Soviet. This is an even more terrible prejudice. It should be known that we are between two major friendly countries and can only take an independent and autonomous diplomatic stance as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, and never let ourselves become the fuse of the next war, so as to plunge the entire nation into an irrecoverable situation. We are willing to sincerely cooperate equally with all allied countries to lay the cornerstone of world peace. At the same time, we also hope that our friendly countries can be open and honest, abandon their suspicions and reconcile with each other, restore the spirit of cooperation during the war, and eliminate the psychology of suspicion and infighting, so as to thoroughly realize the ideal of the United Nations. This is the second point that I sincerely hope for.</p>

<h3>Historical Anecdotes of the Double Tenth</h3>
<p>— Information Office of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The special name "Double Tenth Festival" was first created by Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>The National Day of the Republic of China was set on October 10th by the Senate on September 28th of the first year of the Republic of China, because the day of the Wuchang Uprising was the 19th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in the year of Xinhai, which happened to be October 10th according to the new calendar. Before this, when mentioning the Xinhai Revolution, it was still calculated according to the lunar calendar. After the success of the revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China, the most popular song in schools was "The Revolutionary Army Song," the first two sentences of which said, "On the 19th day of the eighth month, the city of Wuchang, the Revolutionary Army rose up..." which still refers to the lunar calendar. As for the special name "Double Tenth Festival," it was first created by Mr. Wu Zhihui.</p>
<p>Li Yuanhong's appearance on the stage was due to being forcibly dragged out</p>
<p>In the Xinhai Wuchang Uprising, the Revolutionary Army elected Li Yuanhong as the Governor. Later, in order to seek unified appeals in the revolutionary armies of Hubei and Shanghai, Li was also elected as the Grand Marshal, with Huang Xing as his deputy. Afterwards, Li Yuanhong always occupied an extremely important position in the political situation in the early years of the Republic of China. In fact, Li's appearance on the stage was not voluntary, but was forcibly dragged out. He had a confession in a letter to his former superior Sa Zhenbing on October 18th of that year, which roughly stated:</p>
<p>"When the Wuchang Uprising occurred, all the troops under Hong's command had already been deployed for defense, and they were guarding the empty camp alone, at a loss. After the Party Army drove Governor Rui out of the city, they immediately led the team to Hong's camp, surrounded and searched. Hong changed into plain clothes and hid in the room (Editor's note: It is said that he hid under the bed). He was often found and charged with righteousness. At that time, guns and cannons were all around. If he didn't follow, his head would be in a different place. Hong had no choice but to agree temporarily. My teacher has always known that Hong is the most prudent and honest. How dare he do this rashly..." and so on.</p>
<p>The first shot in Wuchang was fired by Xiong Bingkun of the Engineering Battalion</p>
<p>Who fired the first shot in the Wuchang Uprising is also a very interesting question. According to the collection of lectures on the Three Principles of the People by the Premier, it was Xiong Bingkun of the Engineering Battalion. However, at that time, there were many people from Wuhan who participated in the revolutionary uprising and boasted that they were the "uprising people" who fired the first shot, such as Su Chengzhang, Mei Baoqi, Chen Honggao, Mu Hongxun, and Xie Shiqin. These people also added the three words "uprising people" to their signatures when sending telegrams and issuing declarations, in order to appeal to others. There were too many such people, which inevitably aroused suspicion, so someone changed the name of Zhen Qiemin to a short comment to ridicule them, signing himself as "non-climbing uprising person." Later, the "uprising people" actually sued the "non-uprising person" in court for defamation, but it ended without any results. This can also be regarded as an interesting story in revolutionary history.</p>
<p>When the Premier was in the United States, he was worried about the Wuchang Uprising</p>
<p>When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the Premier was in the United States, traveling around to promote the revolution to overseas Chinese, raise donations, and win the sympathy and assistance of foreign governments. On the second day of the uprising, the Premier happened to arrive in Denver, Colorado. More than ten days ago, he had received a telegram from Huang Xing from Hong Kong on the way, but because the luggage had been sent to this place in advance, and the secret telegram book was placed in it, he could not translate it on the way. After arriving in Denver, he took out the secret telegram book from the luggage and translated the telegram. The original telegram said: "Ju Zheng came to Hong Kong from Wuchang and reported that the new army must move. Please remit funds quickly." It was late at night at that time. The Premier was very tired from the journey in the car, so he went to bed and prepared to find a way the next morning. After getting up the next day, he went to the restaurant for dinner, passed the newspaper stand in the corridor, and bought a newspaper and took it into the restaurant to read. After sitting down and spreading out the newspaper, he saw a telegram that said: "Wuchang has been occupied by the Revolutionary Army." Then he knew that the revolution had already broken out.</p>
<p>The people's hearts were trending towards revolution, and there were many extra editions on Wangping Street</p>
<p>When the news of the Wuchang Uprising spread to Shanghai, people's hearts were extremely excited. All newspapers (especially those that were inclined to the revolution) greatly exaggerated and overstated the facts. For example, Hunan only announced its independence on September 1st (lunar calendar), but on August 25th, the Shanghai newspapers had already published in large letters that the Revolutionary Army had occupied Hunan. Although the readers knew that it was unreliable, the people's hearts were trending towards revolution, so as soon as the newspaper came out, it was immediately sold out. At that time, some speculators took advantage of this psychology and issued a kind of tofu-like extra edition on Wangping Street, with only a few dozen words, and the price was the same as the newspaper. Most of the news was fabricated behind closed doors, but once printed, it was immediately sold out. At most, there were more than a dozen kinds of extra editions. In front of the gates of the major newspapers on Wangping Street, it was often seen that many people were guarding and waiting to buy extra editions all day long.</p>
<p>The recovery of Shanghai was on September 14th (lunar calendar) of the Xinhai year. On that day, Chen Ying's army occupied the Manufacturing Bureau. In the afternoon, the military government issued a notice to appease the people. The organization of the military government included Chen Ying as the Governor, Wu Tingfang as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chu Qia Xiang as the Foreign Merchant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Li Pingshu as the Minister of Civil Affairs, Shen Jiuyun as the Minister of Finance, Wang Yiting as the Minister of Commerce, and Li Jianhe as the temporary commander of the military government.</p>
<p>After the recovery of Shanghai, a six-character rhyming announcement was issued</p>
<p>After the recovery of Shanghai, the announcement issued by the military government to appease the people was printed in Song font, with six-character popular rhyming sentences, saying:</p>
<p>It is known that the uprising in Wuchang, the compatriots are united. Wherever our righteous banner points, all will enthusiastically welcome. The recovery of famous cities in various provinces has never hindered peace. Shanghai, a giant port in the southeast, is famous for its trade with the world. Once a large army gathers, the damage will inevitably be not light. Now, according to the order of the military government, we only ask all sectors to show their sincerity. Now, they have all surrendered one after another, which shows that they are united against the enemy. I hope that all dear compatriots will still live in peace and be self-sufficient. Do not take this opportunity to infringe upon the lives and property of foreigners. In a blink of an eye, the Republic of China will be established, and everyone will share peace.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was also a notice posted by "Huang, the judicial chief of Shanghai County," which was Huang Yuanzhi. The date at the end of the notice was "The 4609th year of the Huang Emperor's reign, September 18th."</p>
<p>The celebration meeting in the first year of the Republic of China was unprecedented in the Liulichang, Beijing</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival in the first year of the Republic of China, the celebration meeting in Beijing was held in Liulichang, with more than 300,000 people attending. There were pine flower arches at the east and west entrances of the venue. There were four big characters on the east arch that said "Universal Celebration," and four big characters on the west arch that said "Harmony Among All Nations." The Liulichang kiln was the venue for the meeting. A sacrificial altar was set up in the center, with a spiritual tablet on it, which read: "Spiritual tablets of all gentlemen who died for the Republic of China." There were four large pine flower arches inside and outside the front gate. The arch in the middle outside the gate had the words "For Ten Thousand Years," the arch on the east side had the words "Respect for Humanity," and the arch on the west side had the words "Promote National Glory." The arch inside the gate had the abdication edict of the Qing Empress Dowager Longyu written on it in front, followed by four big characters, which said "Celebration of the Five Races." The National Day Preparatory Committee had previously invited the abdicated Qing royal family to send representatives to attend the meeting twice. The original letter said:</p>
<p>"Respectfully informing you that our association will hold a National Day celebration ceremony on the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth days of October. We have already invited the personnel stationed in Beijing from various countries to attend and observe. Our association is extremely honored. Now we will respectfully send a letter to ask your Majesty the Empress Dowager and your Majesty the Emperor to send representatives to attend the meeting and share the grand event. Not only will the association be greatly honored, but the people of the five races will also receive endless happiness..." and so on.</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival of the first year of the Republic of China, the Premier was in Shanghai. In the afternoon of that day, the Chinese Student Association held a grand National Day memorial meeting, with more than 2,000 guests attending. Dr. Wu Tingfang presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech, which was followed by a speech by the Premier, who said:</p>
<p>"Last year today was the day of the Wuchang Uprising, which was the first day of the Republic of China. At that time, I was in the United States. Comrade Ju Zheng sent a telegram to Mr. Huang Keqiang in Hong Kong, asking me to raise funds to help the army. After reading the telegram, I knew that the Revolutionary Army had captured Wuchang, and I was overjoyed... But although the Republic of China has been established, it is still in a dangerous era, with internal unrest and frequent external troubles. It is like building a mansion, the foundation has been laid, and it still needs to be built. I hope that our compatriots will have an adventurous spirit, perseverance, and work together to support the government from now on, so as to create a first-class power on earth. This is what I deeply hope from you..." This passage, even to this day, thirty-four years later, is still worthy of our vigilance and deep thought.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Brigade Association initiated the Lantern Festival in Shanghai</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival in the fifth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai had died, and the whole country was filled with the joy of the revival of the republic again, so the celebration situation in Shanghai that year was also extremely enthusiastic, especially the Lantern Festival, which was large in scale, full of dazzling things, and beautiful. The Lantern Festival that day was initiated by the Shanghai Fire Brigade Association, and all members from the first to the seventh districts participated. At 7 pm, the Lantern Festival set off, with the cavalry patrol team and security police officers of the Songhu Police Department as the vanguard, followed by the horse team, fire trucks, and platform lanterns. Wherever they passed, firecrackers were set off to welcome them, and the sound of explosions was deafening. When they reached Zhonghua Road, students from various schools also temporarily joined the team with lanterns, and tens of thousands of people turned out into the streets, creating an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>

<h3>The Historical Trajectory of the Double Tenth Festival Over the Past Thirty-Five Years</h3>
<p>— Data Room of This Newspaper</p>
<p>From division to unity, from bondage to autonomy, from revolution to nation-building, it has traversed a long preparatory journey, and everything begins today.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years is not considered a very long time in the founding history of a nation. However, the Republic of China over the past thirty-five years has experienced an extremely long and arduous journey. In the late years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, domestic affairs were corrupt, powerful neighbors were all around, and revolutionary movements seeking internal reform and external independence surged. The Manchu Qing government, with its memories of thousands of years of feudal autocracy, suddenly collapsed. However, the remaining poison of feudal thought still clung to those warlords and politicians. The newly born revolutionary forces did not thoroughly cleanse them, so the Republic, which had not been established for long, was still a mess. The Xinhai Revolution cannot be said to have been thorough in any aspect. It mistakenly believed that its only enemy was the seven-year-old emperor, not knowing that the truly formidable enemy was the remaining poison cultivated by thousands of years of autocracy. Therefore, after the Qing dynasty fell and the Republic was newly established, it compromised with those feudal forces. This first major mistake laid the groundwork for the two subsequent imperial restoration dreams and the more than ten years of regional warlordism. The great task of overthrowing autocratic feudalism hoped for by the Xinhai Revolution was not actually accomplished in the first year of the Republic but in the seventeenth year of the Republic. The completion of the Northern Expedition truly freed China from the chains of feudal forces and gradually moved from a fragmented situation towards stability and unity. The success of the Northern Expedition marked the Chinese nation overcoming its first severe trial.</p>
<p>However, the great cause of the National Revolution was aimed at domestic unity and reform on the one hand, and at external freedom and independence on the other. The Northern Expedition only completed the former, and the Japanese imperialists, alarmed by the powerful force of a unified China, immediately obstructed it in every possible way and constantly provoked incidents. From the Jinan Massacre to the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, the Yuguan and Rehe incidents, and finally the July 7th Incident in the twenty-sixth year, China could no longer tolerate it and had to risk the life and death of the Chinese nation with its not fully prepared national strength. In the eight years that followed, after enduring countless hardships, the Chinese nation finally defeated the enemy and stood up from the ruins. Now, the unequal treaties imposed on it for a hundred years have been abolished, and the Republic of China has, for the first time in the world, an independent personality. The success of the War of Resistance was the Chinese nation overcoming its second severe trial.</p>
<p>But what a huge price we paid! If we briefly review the above historical facts, it is not difficult to see that in the thirty-five years since the founding of the Republic, it struggled against domestic feudal forces for seventeen years and against foreign imperialism for another seventeen years. And now, although the dual shackles have been removed, the country is still on the verge of war internally and subjected to contempt externally. How can such a situation not deserve our reflection and vigilance? On the occasion of the thirty-fifth Double Tenth Festival, we can take this opportunity to revisit the thirty-four Double Tenth Festivals that the Chinese nation has already gone through, and also trace a historical arc along this path, following its traces, so that we can understand what kind of juncture we are standing at today and what kind of road we are facing.</p>
<p>(I) A Fragile Starting Point</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution was originally exchanged for ten failed and painful experiences. However, after the Qing court abdicated and the Republic was established, the revolutionary forces, in their eagerness for success, ignored the Premier's repeated instructions not to compromise with counter-revolutionary forces. They mistakenly believed that those remnants of feudalism, the warlords and politicians, had truly reformed and joined the revolution. So they joined hands with them. The representative of these feudal remnants was naturally Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai was a powerful minister in the late Qing Dynasty and a major figure representing the Qing court in negotiating peace with the revolutionary army. Naturally, he did not understand the true meaning of the revolution at all. However, he was by nature cunning and sly. Seeing that the Qing court's situation was over, he pretended to advocate overthrowing autocracy and establishing a republic to create a world for himself. At that time, everyone, hoping for the success of the peace talks, did not hesitate to hand over the Republic, which they had painstakingly created, to Yuan Shikai. We know that the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution was on October 10, 1911. By February 12 of the following year, the peace talks were successful. Those with shallow vision believed that the Qing court's downfall was so rapid that it was a fortunate thing, but they did not know that it was a great misfortune for the revolution because the corrupt forces of feudalism in the north were still untouched, and the revolution had not yet established a deep and broad foundation among the vast people (this was only truly achieved around the time of the Northern Expedition). Therefore, the counter-revolutionary old forces soon raised their heads again. Although Yuan Shikai was elected as the provisional Grand President, how could he be willing to leave his own feudal lair in the north and place himself in the revolutionary atmosphere of the south? Therefore, he made all sorts of excuses. First, he said that the order was not yet stable and it was difficult to divide himself; then, he created a mutiny, claiming that only by sitting in Beijing could stability be ensured. At that time, the Senate also fell for Yuan's trick and actually agreed to him taking office in the north. It must be known that a revolutionary capital must be established in a revolutionary environment. Given the smoky atmosphere in the north at that time, it would be extremely difficult to promote revolutionary politics, which is very clear. Therefore, the Premier at that time firmly insisted that Nanjing must be the capital. In his letter of resignation, he attached three measures, the first of which was: "The location of the provisional government shall be in Nanjing, as agreed upon by the representatives of the provinces, and cannot be changed." However, most of the party members at that time did not realize this and only sought immediate success, which led to the strange drama of imperial restoration in the following four years.</p>
<p>In short, the scene after the birth of the Republic did not resemble the new atmosphere when a revolution had just succeeded. On the contrary, the revolutionary forces lacked unified leadership and were in turmoil, while the counter-revolutionary feudal forces took advantage of this complex situation to seize control of most of the country. The Xinhai Revolution started an unprecedented beginning in Chinese history, but it did not make good use of this beginning and carry it through to the end, inheriting the spirit of the ten revolutions. Therefore, when the first Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China was celebrated in the first year of the Republic, looking around at the domestic and foreign situation, it seemed to be no different from the situation in the late Qing Dynasty. Domestically, the power issues between the presidential system and the responsible cabinet system were constantly disputed. The State Council was moved to the Presidential Palace, making the State Council exist in name only, and the great power was concentrated in Yuan Shikai's body. Economically, financial resources were exhausted, and the people's livelihood was declining. The only way was to borrow money from Britain and Japan. At the same time, mutinies occurred successively in Wuhu, Luoyang, Pukou, Shashi, and other places, and the order was unstable. And in terms of diplomacy, Britain was formally notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Tibet should not be reorganized into a province. Imperial Russia also notified the government with the Russo-Mongolian Agreement, prohibiting Chinese convoys from stationing in Mongolia. - It was under this situation of internal and external pressure that the Republic of China spent its precarious first year.</p>
<p>(II) The Imperial Dream</p>
<p>If we connect the four Double Tenth Festivals from the second to the fifth year of the Republic into a line, then we can draw the beginning and end of the first ugly drama in the history of the Republic. Yuan Shikai, after becoming the Grand President in his own nest, was always thinking about becoming an emperor. Especially after Song Jiaoren was assassinated, and the punitive expeditions against Yuan by the various superintendents of Jiangnan, such as Chen Qimei, Huang Xing, and Li Liejun (i.e., the so-called Second Revolution in history), all ended in failure, Yuan's arrogance increased. The Yangtze River area was also completely within the sphere of influence of the Beiyang warlords. On October 6th in the second year of the Republic, the Congress elected the formal Grand President. Yuan Shikai secretly instigated his followers, under the guise of public opinion, to surround the Parliament, and was thus elected.</p>
<p>In the Double Tenth Festival of that year, Yuan formally took office in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City of Beijing. After the ceremony, the officials even "shouted ten thousand years three times." Afterwards, he met with the representatives of the Qing Imperial Family in the Hall of Military Glory and made a speech saying, "I am very grateful for the sincerity of the Qing Emperor's congratulations," which really made people wonder whether it was the Republic or the Qing Dynasty at this time. Yuan Shikai's assumption of the office of Grand President already represented the frustration of the revolutionary forces and the arrogance of the reactionary forces, so soon, he dissolved the Parliament, destroyed the Provisional Constitution, and the brewing of the imperial system became increasingly obvious. Those sycophantic followers under him did their best to welcome and encourage him, while people like Yang Du and Liu Shipei chanted the so-called "Monarchical Salvation Theory," touting the strange theory that "republicanism is not suitable for national conditions." At that time, the European War had broken out, and the Japanese army occupied Jinan Station and the Jiaoji Railway line. On the Double Tenth Festival of the third year of the Republic, the newspapers were filled with protests from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the occupation of the Japanese army, which made the atmosphere of National Day very bleak.</p>
<p>In August of the fourth year of the Republic, Yang Du and others established the Preparatory Society for National Security, and Yuan Shikai's conspiracy was now known to everyone. Before and after the Double Tenth Festival, rumors of "national system changes" spread everywhere. Yuan also created public opinion and secretly instigated Liang Shiyi and others to organize the so-called "National Petition Federation," and even so-called beggar petition groups and prostitute petition groups, were varied and strange. Fearing that the Double Tenth National Day might arouse people's thoughts of republicanism, he used the excuse that the current situation was unstable and ordered the whole country to "avoid extravagance at the time" and suspend the celebrations. Thus, the fourth National Day of the Republic of China was quietly spent in sorrow and silence.</p>
<p>In October, the so-called "Organization Law of the National Assembly" was promulgated. Under the control of Yang Du, Liang Shiyi, and others, 1,993 representatives were elected. Naturally, they all unanimously advocated a constitutional monarchy and elected Yuan Shikai as emperor. Yuan also ordered to formally recognize and accept the throne, changed the era name to Hongxian, and formally prepared to ascend the throne.</p>
<p>However, the old forces of feudalism could not resist the revolutionary upsurge after all. When the Premier saw that Yuan's ambition had been revealed, he ordered Hu Hanmin, Xu Chongzhi, and others to go to Southeast Asia to raise funds and launch an uprising, while Chen Qimei presided over it in Shanghai. The Zhaohua warship first raised the flag of punitive expedition. Although the result was unfortunately a failure, the National Protection Army led by Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and others soon launched an uprising in Yunnan and advanced towards the border between Sichuan and Guangxi. Guangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces also responded successively and declared independence. Seeing that the situation was over, Yuan still wanted to abolish the imperial system and retain his own presidential territory, but he was sternly rejected by the National Protection Army. Yuan died of illness in Xinhua Palace on June 6, in the fifth year of the Republic, amid shame and anger. The provinces then successively canceled their independence, which was fortunate because it did not cause a major war and the people were spared further suffering.</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai wasted five years of the history of the Republic of China. He only did one good thing in his life, which was: he died at the right time.</p>
<p>(III) Light in the Darkness</p>
<p>But Yuan Shikai's death did not mean the demise of all feudal remnants. From Yuan Shikai's death in June of the fifth year of the Republic to the Guangzhou oath-taking ceremony for the Northern Expedition in July of the fifteenth year, the history of the Republic went through a very dark period. We can use a few words to briefly describe a picture of the time: politicians, in order to compete for power and profit, formed their own groups and factions, and squabbled with each other. Politics became their own private property. Warlords occupied territory and were constantly declaring "independence." During this period, there were restoration attempts, bribery, and a complete mess. Under this situation, the only remaining bit of righteousness was the revolutionary force in the south led by the Premier.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the political situation in the north during this period, as well as the chaotic wars between the Zhili, Anhui, and Zhilu warlords, are no longer important today and need not be discussed in detail. But one point must be pointed out, namely, that in the midst of these ten years of chaotic wars between politicians and warlords, the revolutionary forces have also been forged more firmly and powerfully. Here, we only need to look back at the direction of the Premier's efforts during these ten years to understand the background of the political situation at that time and the preparation process of the revolutionary forces from the side. This had a great impact on the success of the Northern Expedition later.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Xun's restoration in the sixth year of the Republic and the dissolution of the Parliament, the members of parliament went south one after another, gathered in Guangzhou, convened an extraordinary parliament, elected the Premier as the Grand Marshal, and established the Southern Military Government to confront the evil forces in the north. The Premier's original intention was to unite the forces in the south to form a revolutionary force to save the country. Unfortunately, some local generals still had corrupt territorial concepts and went against the Premier's plan, even changing their minds from morning to evening and creating obstacles in various ways. Seeing this situation, the Premier deeply felt that the success of the revolution could not be achieved overnight. It was necessary to deepen the revolutionary theory and establish a broad foundation on the one hand, and to establish specific strategies for nation-building on the other hand, as a guideline for national construction. In this way, the revolution could be thoroughly successful. At that time, the military government had been controlled by Cen Chunxuan, Lu Rongting, and others. In view of this, the Premier resolutely resigned and left Guangzhou for Shanghai to engage in writing, and wrote "Sun Wen's Theory" and "The Strategy of Nation Building," which became the guiding ideology of the National Revolution.</p>
<p>In the tenth year, the Premier returned to Guangzhou and assumed the post of Extraordinary President, actively preparing for the Northern Expedition. However, due to Chen Jiongming's sudden rebellion, the Premier's plan failed again. In the twelfth year, Cao Kun bribed to become president, and Wu Jinglian and others contracted to buy off members of parliament with huge sums of money, 5,000 yuan per vote. On the day of the election on October 5th, the members of parliament who came to vote and get money were extremely enthusiastic. According to the newspapers at that time, even those who were bedridden were carried in to vote. Thus, Cao Kun was elected as the President of the Republic of China under the support of that batch of "5,000 yuan members of parliament."</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival of the twelfth year was truly a shame in the history of the Republic. Because on this day, Cao Kun, who was elected with 5,000 yuan a vote, formally took office as President in Beijing. The Premier immediately sent a telegram to the whole country from Guangzhou, denouncing Cao Yin. At the same time, in order to cultivate the military strength of the revolution, he ordered the President to prepare the Army Military Academy in Huangpu; and in order to strengthen the organization of the revolution, he reorganized the Kuomintang in January of the thirteenth year and convened the First National Congress in Guangzhou. In his opening remarks, the Premier elaborated his hope: "The reorganization of the Kuomintang this time is firstly to organize a powerful and concrete political party; and secondly, to use the power of the political party to transform the country." After the meeting, a declaration was issued, explaining the internal and external policies of the Three Principles of the People. Later, the success of the Northern Expedition mostly benefited from the military strength of Huangpu; and the reason why the success of the Northern Expedition was so rapid was entirely due to the party's strong leadership and the deep understanding of the principles. The Premier planted the seeds of success, but before he could see them bloom and bear fruit, he passed away. However, this glimmer of dawn in the darkness was bringing the glory of dawn.</p>
<p>(IV) From Division to Unity</p>
<p>The Republic had been established for fifteen years, but everything was still a mess. In the fifteenth year, the year after the Premier's death, in July, the military situation in the south was largely stabilized. The current President then decided to inherit the Premier's will, lead his troops on the Northern Expedition, overthrow the warlords, and implement the National Revolution's advocacy for establishing a China based on the Three Principles of the People. At that time, except for a corner of Guangdong, the Central Plains and especially the North were completely under the control of warlords. The people suffered and the situation was worsening. The Northern Expeditionary Army knew that the warlords had four or five times more troops than they did, and that their weapons and financial resources were even more superior, but for the true success of the revolution, they resolutely took an oath in Guangzhou on July 9 of the fifteenth year and set off.</p>
<p>After the Northern Expeditionary Army set off, it was unstoppable. On the one hand, it was because the revolutionary forces after all had goals and ideals, and their morale was high, which was incomparable to the soldiers who were enslaved and driven by the warlords; and on the other hand, revolutionary ideas had already penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people at that time, and the people everywhere the Northern Expeditionary Army went really brought food and drinks to welcome them. Therefore, the country was unified in less than two years. We can use the situation before and after the three Double Tenth Festivals from the fifteenth to the seventeenth year as a basis to respectively review the progress of the Northern Expeditionary Army during this period.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival of the fifteenth year: After the Northern Expeditionary Army set off from Guangdong, it soon attacked Hunan. Wu Peifu led his troops south, and the three major battles of Tingsiqiao, Jinkou, and Zifang occurred. Wu's army retreated steadily and defended Wuchang. The Northern Expeditionary Army launched three general offensives, risking great sacrifices, and finally captured Wuchang on the Double Tenth Festival, and the central region was stabilized, and its momentum greatly increased.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival of the sixteenth year: After the two lakes were captured, Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu retreated to Jiangxi. The Northern Expeditionary Army gradually advanced, occupying Jiujiang and Nanchang. At the same time, He Yingqin's First Army advanced eastward from Chaozhou and Meizhou and pacified Fujian. Bai Chongxi also led his troops into Zhejiang, attacked Hangzhou, captured Shanghai, and advanced towards Nanjing. In the Battle of Yuhuatai, the battle situation was unprecedentedly fierce, the Northern Expeditionary Army bravely attacked, and Nanjing was also captured. The Jiangnan battle was over at this point. In June, the current President personally led his troops to attack Xuzhou. Yan Xishan of Shanxi also took an oath to punish Feng. At the time of the Double Tenth Festival of the sixteenth year, Shijiazhuang was occupied by the Feng army, and the northward advance was slightly frustrated.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival of the seventeenth year: In mid-April, the current President issued a general offensive order against the Zhilu army on the entire front. The Northern Expeditionary Army won victory after victory along the Jinpu line and attacked Jinan. The current President personally went to Shijiazhuang to supervise the army. Soon, Zhangjiakou and Baoding were successively recovered. Zhang Zuolin, the commander of the Feng army, saw that the situation was over and left the customs on June 3, but he was assassinated by the Japanese in Huanggu Village the next day. The Northeast automatically changed the flag, the country was unified, and the Northern Expedition was successful. Only the Double Tenth Festival of this year, the seventeenth year since the founding of the Republic, saw for the first time the prototype of a unified China, showing a light that had never been seen in the past seventeen years.</p>
<p>(V) Nine Years of Bearing Humiliation and Heavy Burdens</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition was successfully completed, the warlords disappeared, and the country was unified, the first stage of nation-building work was completed at this point. The National Government believed that since the country had been unified from division, it could then move from destruction to construction, and begin the nation-building work that had been repeatedly obstructed since the Xinhai Revolution and had not yet begun. In the seventeenth year, after the success of the Northern Expedition, in the month that the current President made an offering at the tomb of the late Premier in Xishan, he made eight oaths to himself, the first of which was:</p>
<p>"After destruction, construction is urgently needed. My Premier's posthumous works, the Outline of National Construction and the Strategy of National Construction, have clear provisions on the procedures and programs. As long as all comrades firmly believe in and practice them, it will not be difficult to build a new country based on the Three Principles of the People and complete the entire task of the National Revolution."</p>
<p>Therefore, during the nine years from the seventeenth year to the start of the full-scale War of Resistance in the twenty-sixth year, the goal of the National Government was to sort out the mess of a country that had been plagued by wars and then bury itself in construction, enrich its national strength, and ensure that the country really had the strength to achieve internal unity and reform, and to seek freedom and independence externally. Under this goal, from the seventeenth year onwards, national education, economic, financial, transportation, drug control, and other conferences, as well as the Supreme Military Council, were held one after another, and active preparations were made for the reorganization of the army and all nation-building plans. In the Double Tenth Festival of that year, the current President took office as the Chairman of the National Government, and the newly established presidents of the five courts also took the oath of office at the same time. The government also issued a policy declaration, announcing the reduction of troops and expenses, the reorganization of finances, engaging in production, training the people to exercise their civil rights, promoting local autonomy, improving tax collection, unifying currency, developing education, and building the country. Although the plans for nation-building were numerous and complex, they had all taken shape by this point. The Double Tenth Festival of the seventeenth year was filled with a new atmosphere of hope across the country.</p>
<p>However, an internal problem that had been lurking for several years was also becoming increasingly apparent at this time. As early as when the late Premier was alive, in order to concentrate the country's forces and fight to eliminate the forces of the warlords, he announced the opening of the Party to the Communists, allowing Communist Party members to join the Chinese Kuomintang in their individual capacities. At that time, the joint declaration between the Premier and Joffe also stated that communism was not suitable for China, but before and after the success of the Northern Expedition, the Communist Party members in the Kuomintang gradually left the camp of the Three Principles of the People and returned to their old policies of class dictatorship and land confiscation. They also established their own independent regime and military system in Ruijin, Jiangxi, creating another government in a country that had just begun to take the form of unity. As a result, the unfortunate wars of the next few years were brewed, damaging the country's vitality. Finally, this occupied force had to leave Jiangxi, where there was a chorus of complaints, and "march 25,000 miles" to northern Shaanxi, a barren land, to establish another independent regime. However, this unresolved issue remained a hidden concern in national politics and national defense until the start of the full-scale War of Resistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese imperialists, seeing that a strong China was about to take shape, tried every means to obstruct and destroy it. After the "May 3rd Massacre," there was the "Wanbaoshan Incident" and the "Nakamura Incident," which became the excuses for the September 18th Incident. Japan wanted to encompass the Northeast and seize the resources of this vast plain as a foundation for annexing China and annexing the entire Asia. This conspiracy had been around for a long time. In the summer of the twentieth year, the Japanese first instigated Korean farmers to forcibly occupy the rice fields of Chinese farmers in Wanbaoshan Village near Changchun and dug ditches to flood many fields. The Chinese farmers rose up in resistance, and the Japanese army used machine guns to strafe them. After the incident, the Japanese incited Koreans to kill overseas Chinese. In mid-August, they used the pretext of the disappearance of Captain Nakamura to create an atmosphere of tension. On the night of September 18th, they officially sent troops to occupy Shenyang. The Northeast military authorities did not resist because the incident occurred suddenly, so that they could conduct negotiations in a conversational manner, but the Japanese army advanced steadily, and by the 21st, they had occupied the entire province of Jilin. Because the government's military preparations were not sufficient, and the country was experiencing an unprecedented flood in the Yangtze River, and the economy was very exhausted, it had to bear humiliation and heavy burdens and only engaged in localized resistance. In the Double Tenth Festival of the twentieth year, the shadow of "national crisis" was on everyone's eyebrows. In the National Day commemoration meeting on that day, most of the students in the schools wore black gauze with the words "National Crisis" written on them, containing solemn vigilance in the commemoration. In November, the entire province of Heilongjiang also fell.</p>
<p>But the Japanese obstruction to our construction was not enough. Its goal was to ensure that we would never have a chance to breathe and prepare. Therefore, after the "September 18th Incident," there was also the "January 28th" battle, the Yuguan battle, the Rehe battle, and the Great Wall battle, and finally the July 7th Incident occurred, forcing China to temporarily abandon the nation-building work and engage in a decisive battle for national survival.</p>
<p>At this point, the Republic of China entered the second stage of its founding. The work in this stage was as difficult as the first, but the result was as bright.</p>
<p>(VI) From the War of Resistance to Victory</p>
<p>The history of these eight years. Everyone has suffered from it and has fresh memories. There is no need to repeat it. If this process of arduous struggle is divided by three Double Tenth Festivals, then it can be divided into three stages of evolution. The first stage was from the start of the full-scale War of Resistance on July 7th to the retreat from Wuhan around the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-seventh year. During this period, our army fought alone with extremely inferior forces. Although it gave up Nanjing, gave up Xuzhou, and gave up Wuhan, it consumed the enemy along the way, step by step, and broke the enemy's dream of a quick victory. The second stage was from the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-seventh year to the retreat from Yichang around the Double Tenth Festival of the thirtieth year. During this period, our War of Resistance became even more difficult. Most of the resource-rich provinces had fallen, the seaports were blockaded, and transportation was obstructed. But we were still unyielding and followed the Supreme Commander's strategy, using space to gain time, and launched large-scale enemy-held battles, pinning down the enemy's forces. At the end of this stage, around the Double Tenth Festival of the thirtieth year, Yichang also fell, but soon, the world war in the Pacific broke out. Our War of Resistance became a united front with the anti-aggression forces of the whole world. The third stage was from the thirtieth year onwards to the first Double Tenth Festival after the victory of the War of Resistance in the thirty-fourth year, when the whole country rejoiced. During this period, the enemy's strength was weakened day by day. China, in coordination with the forces of the Allied countries, launched counter-offensives one after another, and finally forced the enemy to surrender.</p>
<p>During these eight years, the soldiers and civilians in the rear, under the enemy's crazy bombing and extremely difficult material conditions, gritted their teeth and struggled hard, remembering the famous saying of the great military strategist Jiang Baili before his death: "Whether we win or lose, just don't negotiate peace with him." And the compatriots in the occupied areas, under the enemy's oppression and humiliation, endured hardship and always remembered the suffering motherland, truly "looking west for the royal army for another year." Under their joint efforts, the enemy finally surrendered. The Chinese nation wiped away the shame of its history and, for the first time in three hundred years, gained true freedom and independence.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of everything. On the contrary, this is just the beginning of everything. The goal of a country's founding should be stability and construction, but the internal warlords obstructed us for seventeen years, and the external imperialists obstructed us for another seventeen years. Thanks to thirty-four years of hard struggle, today, all obstacles have been cleared. We should no longer wait and delay. On this thirty-fifth Double Tenth Festival, we should recognize this historical fact and be deeply vigilant. The country demands unity, stability, peace, and construction. All turmoil and destruction that goes against this goal will not be tolerated or forgiven by the 450 million people.</p>
<p>Over the past thirty-five years, from division to unity, from bondage to autonomy, from revolution to nation-building, it has traversed a long preparatory journey, and everything begins today.</p>
<p>Yellow Crane Tower Today</p>
<h3>Interview with Two Founding Figures</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhou Han from Hankou</p>
<p>——Mr. Yu Yuzhi and Mr. Li Chunxuan——</p>
<p>"Autumn winds," it seems, are not without reason. Over the past two days, Wuhan has been hit by violent storms, with flying dust filling the sky and boats capsizing in the river, with six or seven incidents reported one after another. The reporter, carrying out the mission of the newspaper, wanted to go to Wuchang to find some historical materials related to the Xinhai Uprising or to interview several well-known figures of the uprising; however, the ferries were suspended all day, and several times the reporter went to the riverbank, only to be turned back by the storm, and had to "sigh at the river without crossing"!</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the task, I thought of using the method of gathering materials locally, and according to the list of founding comrades, braved the threat of wind and dust to "prospect" to the relevant parties. As a result, with the help of several friends, I actually found gold in the sand. In the hasty interviews, I saw Mr. Yu Yuzhi and Mr. Li Chunxuan, whom I wanted to interview, which was truly a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p>Mr. Yu once served as the Director of the Finance Department of Hubei Province and the Chairman of the Provincial Party Department (currently a Councillor). His life is very simple. After the reporter presented his card and explained his purpose, he began to talk about the motives, process, and feelings of the founding of the republic in a calm and firm tone.</p>
<p>"The revolution of Tang and Wu conformed to Heaven and responded to the people; this is a very reasonable saying, just like a theorem in geometry, there must be a straight line between two points." Mr. Yu first pointed out the principles and philosophy of the revolution, and explained it to the reporter repeatedly in detail.</p>
<p>"Because revolution is not a general 'rebellion,' but an inevitable product of the times. This was the case in the monarchical era, and it is the same in the republican era. If one hangs up a sheep's head and sells dog meat, even if it is called a democratic republic, someone will surely come to revolt and overthrow it. Thousands of years ago, our country had the idea of 'cherish me, I follow; mistreat me, I hate,' let alone today when the people are highly enlightened? The late Premier rose up to lead the revolution not only because of his noble character, great courage, and far-sighted vision, but also because the Manchu Qing had reached the end of its rope in losing power and humiliating the country, so with a call from on high, the whole country followed like the wind, and everyone sang the anti-Manchu revolution very simply. This is the revolutionary manifestation of conforming to Heaven and responding to the people. If the Manchu Qing were not overthrown at that time, there would be no way to save the nation, no way to talk about civil rights, let alone people's livelihood."</p>
<p>Speaking of his own motives and experiences in participating in the revolution, Mr. Yu said: "At that time, I lived in the Army Surveying School in Wuchang, deeply moved by the revolutionary ideas of the time and inspired by the spirit of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs. I also opposed empty talk of constitutionalism and the royalists who sought skins from tigers, so I resolutely devoted myself to the revolution in order to find a thorough way to regenerate."</p>
<p>The Hair-Cutting Movement - Unable to Find Out Who Was the Leader</p>
<p>"I remember that in the first month of the Xinhai year, at the beginning of our semester, we launched a hair-cutting movement. First, I drew a circle and asked everyone to sign around it. As we signed, we cut, and in one night, we turned the braids of more than a hundred classmates into monk's heads. The school authorities could not find out who was the 'ringleader.' The next day, Superintendent Liu came to the school and was furious, saying: 'You eat the rice of the Great Qing and read the books of the Great Qing, but you want to listen to heresies and do these reactionary things, you really fail the imperial grace!' As a result, everyone was given a major demerit. It can be seen the confusion and ignorance of those in power at that time. And the progress of this movement was indeed shocking at that time. But this is only one side of the shock. In fact, 'the mountains are about to be hit by rain, and the wind is filling the building.' From that time on, the latent power of the revolution had gradually filled the entire Wuhan. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the revolutionary tide reached its peak, and there was a possibility of riots at any time. In order to prepare for the action, I secretly told my family on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, please do not worry about my personal whereabouts. My family was surprised and delighted, and tears streamed down my face for a while. It is inevitable to feel reluctant!" (Reporter's note: The Superintendent Liu here refers to the principal of the Army Surveying School at that time. According to Mr. Yu, the reason why his name is not written directly is to show kindness.)</p>
<p>Scholars Rebel - Hitting Stone Slabs to Make Gunfire</p>
<p>Memorial Stele for Martyr Chen Dingyi's Sacrifice in the First Uprising Park</p>
<p>When Mr. Yu talked about this, his expression became particularly tense. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Coincidentally, two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival, our revolutionary party's secret agency in Baoshan Lane in the French Concession of Hankou had an explosion due to carelessness in making bombs. Comrade Sun Wu was injured on the spot, and the plot was leaked. Three martyrs, Peng Chufan (from Echeng), Liu Fuqing (from Hunan), and Yang Hongsheng (from Gucheng), were arrested, and the three towns of Wuchang, Yangxia, and Hanyang became a scene of terror."</p>
<p>"On the 19th, the weather changed suddenly. The surveying students had all changed into green serge uniforms. At that time, people mostly called us the real revolutionaries sent by the Premier. On the morning of that day, the gates of Wuchang were closed, and the school was suspended in disguise. A few students secretly contacted outside. In the evening, they pretended to be studying on their own and gathered in the study room to support the work. At that time, because I was impatient, I used stones to hit the stone slabs to make the sound of gunfire, and I wrote revolutionary military banners and displayed them in the classroom. Some students blamed me for being rash. In retrospect, it was indeed a bit ridiculous; but the hot blood was impulsive and naturally revealed, and there was no way to restrain myself. Before long, there was indeed a loud noise of gunfire and the sound of horses' hooves, and it was inevitable to feel frightened. In the midst of this chaos and commotion (around 8 p.m.), student representatives Li Yidong and others brought a large number of guns. Just as they arrived at the school gate, they first fired a volley of shots and then lined up and fired, preparing to set off. At this time, the 'scholars' rebellion' was a bit flustered after all, so I secretly drank two bowls of cold water in an attempt to strengthen my courage."</p>
<p>"After setting off, in order to support the engineering battalion that launched the first attack, we concentrated on Chuwangtai and replenished our guns with live ammunition on the spot. Subsequently, we were ordered to guard the Tonghu and Dadong gates. That night, the banner soldiers Du Chenxiang led his troops to fight like trapped beasts in the city. When Du's troops came to attack our Tonghu gate garrison, student Liu Runsheng hurriedly dragged me to the ground to fight back. 'A blind man riding a blind horse, coming to a deep pond in the middle of the night.' Recalling it afterwards, I still feel terrified!"</p>
<p>Inviting Li Yuanhong to be Responsible for Commanding Military Affairs</p>
<p>"The next day, we occupied the Consultative Bureau. At this time, we only met Yan Shanqian, who handed over a tael of silver yuan treasures stored in the bureau and expressed his warm welcome. I took this silver yuan treasure and went with my classmate Fu Jinshan to buy paper to write notices. When we arrived at the Consultative Bureau, the students tore down the window curtains and tore them into pieces to tie on their left arms as temporary symbols of the revolutionary party. It can be seen the excitement and sincerity of the emotions at this time."</p>
<p>"Later, the students and military comrades invited Li Yuanhong to the government to command the military affairs, and organized the Hubei Military Governor's Office, and promoted Li to be the Military Governor of the Hubei Army. Our students were divided into the General Staff, the Documents Department, the General Affairs Department, the Internal Affairs Department, and the Inspection Department to serve. When the northern army went south and the situation was tense, a Surveying Department was established, and some students were sent to the vicinity of Wuhan to conduct armed mapping, and they often encountered battles with the northern army, so many people died in battle. Later, the war in Wuhan became more and more urgent, and we were driven by righteous indignation to volunteer to join the dare-to-die team, holding broadswords, carrying long spears, and wearing red belts around our waists, and went to the Dazhimen Liujiamiao area to fight to the death with the enemy. Recalling the scene of that year, even I myself feel refreshed." Mr. Yu gestured with his hands as he narrated, seeming to feel particularly excited and energetic. (Reporter's note: According to Mr. Yu, before the first uprising, there was a so-called three-army commander in the military at that time, one commanded by Li Yuanhong, stationed in Wuhan; one commanded by Lan Tianwei, stationed in Yantai; and one commanded by Ying Yuncong (i.e., Long Xiang), stationed in Henan. And the one commanded by Li was a mixed association, with a larger organization than the current brigade, so the strength was quite strong.)</p>
<p>Republic Completed - Ordered Students to Freely Choose Careers</p>
<p>"After several large and small fierce battles, the North and South soon ceased fighting, and the Republic was completed. Li ordered the students to go to the government to freely choose careers, to show his reward and gratitude. At that time, I felt that revolution was an act of righteousness. Although the overall situation had been settled, if I rushed to seek a position and recklessly dreamed of wealth, it would still be the behavior of a despicable man, which a revolutionary party member should not have. At the same time, I deeply felt that my own knowledge needed to be enriched urgently, so I decided to take a low-level position in the Surveying Bureau and use the space to study lectures on law and politics. Unexpectedly, as the current situation evolved, Yuan planned to claim the title of emperor and exclude party members. When the Hukou Battle started, someone was unfavorable to me, so I resolutely resigned and went east to Japan to study at Nihon University, burying myself in the study of politics and law in order to fulfill my original intention of seeking knowledge." Speaking of this, Mr. Yu recalled the past and seemed to be a little sad. He declared that he himself had already fulfilled his long-cherished wish and did not need to express any emotion! But he saw that many old comrades were not provided for, and there were quite a few revolutionary orphans who became starving people. Especially in the past eight years, our compatriots have suffered terribly from the turmoil. Although we have won victory for many years, there are still many people who cannot return home. Therefore, he finally felt deeply that his responsibility had not been fulfilled, and he solemnly put forward such a request and hope: "We are the ruling party, and we are the people who shoulder the responsibility of building a new China with the Three Principles of the People. If others kill, set fires, and destroy national unity, the people of the country should condemn them and demand punishment. But if we cannot stabilize society and the people's livelihood, so that tigers and rhinos come out of their cages and fuel the disaster, we cannot but be deeply vigilant! In order to comfort the souls of the martyrs in heaven, we have to work hard again!" Yes, Mr. Yu is an advanced revolutionary, and at the same time, he is now a National Councillor, so his words focus on the national economy and the people's livelihood everywhere, fully demonstrating the identity of a people's representative.</p>
<p>Visiting Li Chunxuan - The Youngest Comrade of the First Uprising</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Mr. Yu, the reporter went to visit Mr. Li Chunxuan (i.e., Zuodong). He was the youngest of the founding comrades that year, and now he is also a 54-year-old veteran.</p>
<p>Walking into Li's house, Mr. Li was busy preparing for the expanded celebration of the Double Tenth Festival. Thanks to the introduction of his younger brother, Bingwei, he seemed particularly kind and humble in talking to the reporter.</p>
<p>"Regarding the process of the first uprising, I think someone has already talked about it, so I don't need to repeat it. Now I would like to explain a little more about the relationship between the Hubei Army Special Primary School and the Xinhai Revolution."</p>
<p>Mr. Li opened this topic and first emphasized the achievements of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Zhidong) in Hubei. He said: "Duke Wenxiang spared no effort in revitalizing education and cultivating talents in Hubei; most of the later revolutionary volunteers came from his school, such as Mr. Huang Keqiang, Mr. Zhang Guoen, Mr. Wang Shijie, and my wife, all of whom were students of the Lianghu Normal School. People like Mr. Song Jiaoren and Mr. Tian Tong were ordinary students of the Literary Academy. And the Army Special Primary School was founded by Duke Zhang Wenxiang himself. Most of the students joined the Kuomintang, and the school's students contributed a lot to the Xinhai Revolution."</p>
<p>Mr. Li pointed out that the characteristic of this primary school was that the treatment was generous, and graduates could be assigned to platoon leaders and other battles, and the admission standards were very high. All of them were selected from the excellent soldiers of each iron association camp (military system name) to participate in the examination, and they could only be admitted after passing the examination. At the same time, the imperial examination was abolished that year, and it was difficult for the reading people to find a way out, so most of them gave up their pens and joined the army in order to obtain the qualifications to enter the Lu Primary School. Because of this, it was common for scholars to become soldiers at that time, and the so-called combination of civil and military had already started the trend.</p>
<p>The Students of Lu Primary School Were Implicitly the Backbone of the Revolution</p>
<p>"What is particularly worth mentioning is that the students of Lu Primary School were not expelled from the original army in the registration, and their salaries were still paid as usual. They went to school early in the morning and returned to the camp in the evening to spread revolutionary ideas! People like Cai Jimin, Xiao Guobao, Du Wuku, and Li Jiguang were all students of the school, and they were implicitly the backbone of the revolution, and their appeal was very strong!" Mr. Li said. He and Deng Yulin were close friends with people like Xiao Guobao and Li Jiguang, so they were able to participate in all the consultations and knew the situation at that time.</p>
<p>"There is one more point that can prove that the students of Lu Primary School were jealous! That is, Zhang Biao, the commander of the Eighth Town, has always disliked the graduates of Lu Primary School and never hired them. Later, Zhang heard that the students of Lu Primary School participated in the revolution and retreated to Hankou, so he offered a reward, stating that whoever arrested a student of Lu Primary School would be rewarded with 10,000 strings of cash, which shows their fear of the students of Lu Primary School."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. Li explained that the students of Lu Primary School were not subject to any inspection when entering and leaving. At that time, books that promoted revolution, such as The Ten Days of Yangzhou and A Fierce Awakening, were secretly sent from Shanghai to Hubei, and then spread to every revolutionary youth through the distribution of the students of Lu Primary School. The reason why Li Yuanhong was appointed as the governor was not only because Li himself gained the hearts of the military with his loyalty and honesty, but also because of the enthusiastic support of the students of Lu Primary School.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Li concluded: "Education is the source of spreading the seeds of revolution. After the revolution was successful, all the ancestral halls of Zeng Wenzheng and Hu Wenzhong in Hubei were destroyed one after another, and only the buildings such as Baobing Hall and Aolue Building, which commemorate Duke Zhang Wenxiang, were not destroyed at all! This is because the merits of Duke Wenxiang's education and cultivation of talents cannot be erased!"</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Li handed the reporter two precious photos, one was the Governor's Office of the Wuchang Consultative Bureau at the time of the uprising, and the other was the scene of all walks of life welcoming the Premier when he came to Wuhan in the first year of the Republic. Mr. Li firmly said: "The success of the Xinhai Revolution was not accidental, and this reason must be sought from real historical materials!"</p>

<h3>The Celebration Thirty-Five Years Ago - Digging Up Past Events (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>(Beijing) This morning, the weather was clear and sunny, and at 8:00 a.m., Zhao Bingjun, representing the President, presided over the ceremony of commemorating the martyrs, and changed the Gate of Great Qing to the Gate of China. At the same time, the unveiling ceremony of the gate plaque was held. Various organs and groups in Liulichang held a Republican Commemorative Meeting. There were 16,000 soldiers on Hadamen Street, standing upright on the street in left and right formations all day long. The former Qing nobles and school drill grounds held a drill inspection ceremony. Prince Karaqin and the Living Buddha of Inner Mongolia were present, and the Living Buddha of Inner Mongolia came to the meeting in a two-wheeled yellow car, which was far away from the car body, indicating that the rider was highly respected. For a time, the yellow robes were brilliant, and the whole field was amazed.</p>
<p>(Shanghai) Today, the business and academic circles of Shanghai, together with the members of the Chamber of Commerce and various industry business groups, set out from the office of the Chamber of Commerce in Lujiabang for a parade to celebrate. They passed through the Manufacturing Bureau to West Bridge, and then to the Poor Children's Home, where they lined up, sang the national anthem, and fired thirteen volleys of rifles. At 8:00 p.m., the Zhabei Police Station, the Cavalry Patrol Team, and the Infantry Team of the Restoration Army jointly held a lantern festival. Nanyang University, St. John's University, Wusang School, the Universal Chinese Students' Association, the Sino-Western School, McKillen College, and Mingqiang Elementary School all participated. They passed through Hengfeng Road, Datong Road, and Nanchuanhong Road, etc. The procession was three miles long. The lanterns included trains, airships, Wuchang City, Western beauties, etc. The cheers along the way were thunderous.</p>
<p>(Suzhou) The Governor's Office held a Restoration Commemorative Banquet today. The whole city was decorated with lanterns and streamers. In the evening, fireworks were set off at the Xin Kaihe Bridge drill ground outside the Jianmen Gate. Liuyuan Garden was open, and only half the fee was charged. At 8:00 p.m., the lantern celebration began. Soochow University had a giant lantern in the shape of the Yellow Crane Tower to commemorate the Wuchang Uprising. All members of the Chamber of Commerce used white crepe to tie small and large colored balls and hung them on their bodies, singing and marching in the procession.</p>
<p>(Wuchang) Today, a sacrifice venue was set up in the former Qing Wanshou Palace, and the spirit tablets of the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution were placed everywhere. Representatives of the governors of various provinces paid tribute, and ordered all organs and groups to set up spirit tablets of the martyrs at each office location and worship them themselves. At the same time, a commemorative meeting was convened by the Governor's Office. Because it was just after the mutiny of the cavalry, the security was very strict. Police were densely stationed near Baobing Hall, and traffic was restricted. The people of Wuhan generally called "National Day is really an unlucky day."</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Among the Restoration Commemorative Meetings, the emotions of the military were the most intense. The officers and soldiers of the 3rd, 7th, and 8th Divisions stationed in Nanjing all voluntarily donated one-tenth of their salaries as commemorative expenses. Each street was decorated with archways and lanterns, with a riot of color. The roads were crowded with pedestrians. In the morning, the Governor's Office entertained consuls from various countries. Cheng Dequan and Huang Keqiang both gave impassioned speeches. Western food was used for the banquet. At noon, the Chengzheng Office paid tribute to the martyrs who died for the Republic at the Wanshou Palace. In the evening, fireworks were set off everywhere. The lantern festival had a huge "Iron and Blood Founding Anniversary" lighthouse participating in the parade. Military songs were overflowing, and the scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) and Shantou held Restoration Commemorative Meetings today. There were many female representatives at the meeting.

<p>(Songjiang) Today, the Tongmenghui branch held a meeting in the Chen-Xia Ergong Temple to pay tribute to the martyrs who died. All the groups in the city convened a commemorative meeting in Drunken Bai Pond. Ms. Ding Yuexin gave a speech, urging women to "not be ignorant, and then be stained with the bad habits of Yan and Zhang, and only be a burden to men." In the evening, Tongmenghui members rode horses with lanterns, and jointly held a grand parade with the business groups and the various camps of the Navy. At the same time, Civil Administrator Xie specially allocated 200,000 texts of public funds to personally comfort and relieve the orphans and the poor.</p>

<h3>My Opinion on National Affairs</h3>
<p>— Situ Meitang</p>
<p>The Republic of China was founded. From the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 to the Double Tenth Festival this year, it has been exactly thirty-five years. If we count from the enemy's surrender and the restoration of our land, this is the second Double Tenth Festival. Last year's Double Tenth Festival, I was in America; this year's Double Tenth Festival, I am in the motherland. Today's publication is my first since returning home.</p>
<p>Tracing back to before the founding of the Republic of China, we engaged in revolutionary movements overseas, based on the Hongmen overseas Chinese organization, upholding the spirit of national revolution for more than two hundred years, striving arduously, and never yielding. Before the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, there was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, namely the historically famous Battle of Huanghuagang. In this battle, the responsibility for raising funds almost entirely fell on our American Hongmen. The Zhigongtang buildings in three ports of British Canada were mortgaged and sold to provide for revolutionary patriots. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen often said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution," which actually referred to the Hongmen overseas Chinese. Even Mr. Sun Yat-sen's travel expenses from America back to China to assume the post of Provisional President in Nanjing were personally collected and subsidized by me and my comrades before he could make the journey. Therefore, today, on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Double Tenth Festival, recalling the facts of the 1911 Revolution, I am truly overwhelmed with emotion!</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, we, far away overseas, cherished fervent hopes, believing that the national revolution had been successfully concluded, that the Republic of China would achieve the five ethnicities united as one, and implement democracy, making our country a new nation governed by the people, of the people, and for the people, with prosperity and strength to be expected without any doubt. Therefore, at that time, the Hongmen overseas Chinese, with chivalry and righteousness, and loyalty to the country, all held the ideal of retiring after success, and were unwilling to interfere in the politics of the motherland. Who knew that later there would be the Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy, Zhang Xun's restoration, the tyranny of the Northern Warlords, fighting for cities and land, frequent civil wars, and the country was on the verge of collapse. We abroad felt extremely disappointed. Therefore, for every national salvation movement, we still contributed money and effort. For the final Northern Expedition led by the Kuomintang, we held even more boundless hopes, believing that national unification was within reach. Who knew that later there would be even more internal party struggles, brothers fighting each other, turning weapons against each other, year after year of civil war, eventually leading to foreign aggression and the "September 18th" Incident in Shenyang. We, living overseas, felt deeply for the motherland and our pain was indescribable. Therefore, we unanimously rose up to save the nation, advocated unity against aggression, and strongly advocated resistance, establishing anti-Japanese national salvation associations everywhere, as a backing for the motherland's resistance. The Hongmen overseas Chinese, known for their revolutionary spirit, made the greatest contribution to the war of resistance. Therefore, after the July 7th Incident and the opening of the full-scale war, we rallied and appealed even more vigorously. Taking myself as an example, in addition to advocating for donations, I also intensified the Hongmen unity, unifying the Hongmen effort agencies in the Americas, strengthening the organization, and contributing all our strength to the war of resistance. In 1941, I was also ordered to return to China to pay respects to the highest authorities of the war of resistance and to comfort the wounded and those in distress. On this trip, as soon as I returned to the country, just as Hong Kong was about to fall, I stepped forward and gathered the Hongmen brothers in Hong Kong to help the defending troops. Therefore, when the enemy entered Hong Kong, I was arrested and almost sacrificed my old life in this battle. Who knew that I would still be able to witness the restoration of the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, and still be able to meet with my compatriots across the country in writing today.</p>
<p>Now that our land has been restored, I am fulfilling the mission of the overseas Hongmen revolutionary organization in the Americas, returning to China to form a party, just as the call for returning power to the people and implementing democratic politics is rising. All my fellow overseas Chinese believe that our motherland is already one of the four major powers, and we should strive for strength and contribute to the motherland in a timely manner. This is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. I, in my old age and foolishness, also believe so. Who knew that in the five months since returning home, all I have seen is corruption, people struggling to survive, foreign goods flooding the market, no hope for industrial revival, commercial depression, economic bankruptcy, and financial collapse. I truly do not know how to save the country. Moreover, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still ongoing. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have all been broken. Our great land, not destroyed by foreign enemies, is now on the verge of ruin due to internal decay. An eighty-year-old man, having experienced revolution and resistance, almost sacrificing his life, originally believed that the motherland was bound to become strong. How could I have expected to witness the motherland on the verge of ruin today? With a heart full of worry, I cannot help but speak earnestly to my compatriots. You may call it my foolish opinion, or you may call it my opinion on national affairs. I will now list the key points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should immediately cease the civil war. When the two parties united to resist the war, all overseas Chinese celebrated. When the New Fourth Army Incident occurred due to the friction between the two parties, all overseas Chinese were extremely anxious. During the New Fourth Army Incident, I already represented the overseas Hongmen Chinese in strongly advising both sides. Unfortunately, my voice was too weak to prevent the disaster from happening, and after the enemy surrendered, civil war broke out. We still need friendly countries to mediate. For months, there have been no results. "Boiling beans to make broth, the stalks crackle in the pot," it is painful to speak of. I believe that today's national affairs should make the cessation of civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party the first condition.</p>
<p>(2) Convene a National Assembly and enact a constitution. Regarding the government's promise to convene a National Assembly and return power to the people, it has been announced to the world countless times. When will this promise be fulfilled? This is what the world is watching. Originally, since the founding of the Republic of China, it has been thirty-five years, and the national law has not yet been determined. There is no guiding principle above, and no law to abide by below. The chaos in national politics is rooted in this. Now, in order to reverse the chaos and restore order, the only way is to quickly convene a National Assembly meeting, determine the political system, and lay a foundation for the future. However, national laws cannot be monopolized by one party, one faction, or one person. There must be a government representing the entire people to preside over it. Therefore, before convening the National Assembly meeting for discussion, it is especially important to obtain the genuine representatives of all parties and factions and the entire people. Therefore, I believe that today's national affairs should make the convening of a National Assembly meeting to enact a democratic constitution the second condition.</p>
<p>(3) Implement democracy and promote world peace. Regarding the current post-war world, Britain and the United States are confronting the Soviet Union, and their ideologies and systems are different. International conflicts are not only sufficient to cause a third world war, but can also lead to the division of our country. Therefore, for the sake of China's current situation, there is no way to unite and unify the country without implementing democratic politics, and world peace cannot be promoted without China's unification. We have been living overseas for a long time and are familiar with the international situation. Now, seeing the situation in our country, we know even more that this is the only way to save China, which is on the verge of division. Therefore, I believe that today's national affairs should make the implementation of democracy and the promotion of world peace the third condition.</p>
<p>The above three points are just the main points. As for the national salvation program, there is also the declaration of the China Hongmen Democratic Party, which I recently initiated, with detailed analysis. Whether it is right or wrong, I hope that all the wise men of the country will openly discuss it and study it together. An eighty-year-old man can only silently pray for the peaceful unification of the Republic of China, the realization of democratic politics, and the daily progress towards strength, without betraying the original intention of revolution and resistance. That is all, what else can I say!</p>
<h3>Special Work of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zukang</p>
<p>The tasks of the Bureau of Public Works can be roughly divided into eight categories: roads, bridges, ditches, waterways, docks, embankments, buildings, and gardens. In the past year, considerable construction has been carried out in these eight categories of projects, and there are three items that are special in nature and worthy of record: (1) Developing flood prevention projects; (2) Repairing the Pudong seawall; (3) Constructing citizen residences. Now, I will briefly record these three special tasks to inform readers.</p>
<p>1. Development of Flood Prevention Projects</p>
<p>The causes of floods in this city are: (1) The ditch system is disordered, and the size of the ditches is too small; (2) In most areas of the city, the height of the flat land is below the highest tide level, and there is a phenomenon of tidal backflow; (3) The river channels at the outlets of rainwater pipes have been silted up for a long time, and the riverbed has risen. Rainwater cannot be discharged as soon as dredging begins; (4) "Gullies" or riverbanks are filled with garbage, causing silting. Because of these four reasons, the Bureau has adopted the following principles for flood prevention work in recent years: (1) Dredge riverbanks to facilitate drainage; (2) Dredge sewers, remove "Gullies" to prevent accumulation; (3) Reconstruct and enlarge bottleneck-type ditches to smooth water flow; (4) Build tide gates and pumping stations to prevent tidal backflow. After a year of active work, most low-lying areas have less water accumulation or shorter water accumulation periods during heavy rain and high tides recently, which can be said to be a partial achievement of flood prevention work.</p>
<p>2. Emergency Repair of the Pudong Seawall</p>
<p>The city's seawall in Pudong is the Dongtang, starting from the mouth of the Huangpu River to Huangjiawan in Chuansha County, with a total length of 15 kilometers. It has not been repaired for many years, resulting in many gaps and extreme danger. Last winter, the Bureau organized a seawall engineering team to conduct on-site surveys and formulated a repair plan. First, the breaches in Zhangjiazai, Daijiazai, Zouzai, and Yinlujiazai south of the seaside bathing beach were urgently repaired, with a total length of 1,352 meters. The main design is to use concrete retaining walls as the main part of the embankment, with a rubble revetment outside the wall and a row of piles at the foot of the slope, with a slight pile of stone blocks outside the piles. A revetment sloping upwards is also set inside the wall, and the top of the slope is an earthen embankment. This seawall project started purchasing materials in mid-May, started construction in mid-July, and the retaining wall was completed ten days ago, and the entire project was completed in September. Recently, on the third day of the ninth lunar month, a hurricane and high tide hit the seawall at the same time, and the embankment project was unharmed, celebrating peace together. To the north of the seaside bathing beach, there were no original breaches, but the sections destroyed in the past eight years are longer than those south of the seaside bathing beach, and preparations for repair have now begun.</p>
<p>3. Construction of Civil Residences</p>
<p>The housing shortage in this city is extremely serious. At the beginning of the Bureau's takeover, it paid attention to the restoration of the original civilian villages and the preparation for the construction of new citizen residences. Originally, it was planned to build 3,000 houses as a promotion, but due to the shortage of municipal treasury funds, it was forced to change the plan and planned to build 160 citizen residences in Nanshi and Zhabei respectively. Later, due to the limitation of not being able to raise funds at one time, it had to be reduced again, and a citizen village was first built on Damuqiao Road in Nanshi, with 154 residential buildings and affiliated public facilities, etc. Construction started in June, the main building was completed in August, and water and electricity facilities are being added, and it can be completed this month. It is sold by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company, following the previous method of renting land to build houses, with the goal of officially announcing and registering the sale in twenty years, which will be held soon. Many citizens have sent letters requesting it. It is rumored that "the rich don't want it, and the poor can't afford it," which is not true. As far as civil servants and teachers are concerned, they may have this feeling, but other people with better economic conditions seem to be more inclined to buy it. In any case, it can help alleviate the housing shortage. Furthermore, it was recently heard that the central government plans to allocate special funds for civil servants and teachers in Beijing and Shanghai to build housing separately to help them. This is also good news amidst the housing shortage in this city.</p>
<h3>Three Major Events in Education</h3>
<p>— Hang Liwu</p>
<p>After the end of the war of victory, Chairman Jiang emphasized and put forward the slogan of education first. Indeed, education is the foundation of national construction, and the laying of this foundation is extremely complicated. Now, when everything is waiting to be rebuilt and everything is waiting to be done, there are three major events that are urgent tasks for us in the next three to five years, and we must strive to promote them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>First, is to enrich the equipment of instruments and books in schools and research institutions at all levels.</p>
<p>I often say that the ten years from the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing to the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 was a golden age for our country to engage in new education, but unfortunately Japan did not allow us to continue building like this. During the war, the level of schools at all levels decreased due to the impact of equipment, economy, and war disturbances. Now that education has resumed, the goal is naturally to improve the quality of education at all levels. The most important basic condition to achieve this goal is equipment. If schools do not have sufficient equipment such as instruments and books, how can they improve their teaching level and understanding ability? If research institutions do not have sufficient equipment, how can they promote research and promote scientific progress? Therefore, the first thing to do when education resumes is to enrich the equipment.</p>
<p>Second, is to eliminate illiteracy and promote compulsory education.</p>
<p>Countries with developed education, such as the United States, are now promoting the so-called movement of education for democracy. In our country with backward education and political democratization, this movement is even more urgently needed. The so-called education for democracy is to use education to train and cultivate citizens of democratic countries to ensure political democracy and fully develop the spirit of democracy. This is indeed the basic work of democratic politics. However, this kind of education is not only to make people recognize a few words, but also to give them the skills for production and the training for autonomous economy.</p>
<p>Third, is the scientific movement.</p>
<p>That is to popularize scientific interest and knowledge. If we want to develop industry and improve agriculture, the most basic work is to instill scientific interest and knowledge into the countryside, so that it deeply penetrates the general public. Although I am not a researcher of natural science, I am very willing to work hard to promote this movement, and I hope that the domestic scientific community will jointly shoulder this arduous responsibility, using words and languages, using movies and broadcasts, using pictures and active models, using various methods and tools to promote the scientific movement. This requires the efforts of the masses.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a small opinion, that is, everyone has a responsibility for education. We should mobilize the strength of the masses, use the wisdom of the masses, and use the mental and physical strength of the masses to strengthen the effectiveness of education and promote the consequences of education. For several years, a unhealthy atmosphere has developed in society, almost everything is hoped or asked the government to do. We must know that the government cannot do everything, and it really cannot do so many things, not to mention that it is more limited by human, financial, and time constraints. The cause of education is beneficial to the country and the people, beneficial to others and beneficial to oneself. I hope that society can exert its greatest strength and shoulder part of the responsibility, suggesting that the government improve education and assist the government in promoting education. In this way, the above three major events can have a great impact and effect.</p>
<h3>Activating Land Finance Requires Registration First</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ping</p>
<p>Since the opening of Shanghai in the Qing Dynasty, Chinese and foreign people have gathered here, the population has increased, industry and commerce have flourished, and land prices have become expensive. The largest amount of capital is not gold dollars, but real estate. If such a large amount of real estate value is used for production and construction, it will undoubtedly help the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market. However, the important prerequisite is to complete land registration first, so that the property rights are certain and the credit is solid, so as to facilitate the transfer of rights or the establishment of burdens. Therefore, land registration is closely related to the development of industry and commerce in this city. Land registration in this city began in 1927, and a small part was completed by 1937, but it was suspended due to the full-scale war of resistance. After the occupation, the enemy and puppets seized it, causing the land registration to become more chaotic. Until the enemy surrendered last autumn, we returned to our homeland. At the beginning of the recovery, everything was waiting to be rebuilt, and cleaning up land rights was the most urgent task. Therefore, we first handled the general registration according to law in the six most important areas of this city: Huangpu, Hunam, Zhabei, Yixiang, Fahua, and Caojing. Since the opening in November last year, it has been ten months. At first, the owners felt that the procedures were too complicated. Later, after improvement based on the four principles of (1) simplifying procedures, (2) shortening processing time, (3) saving business labor costs, and (4) strictly prohibiting demands, the business began to develop. Now that the registration period is not convenient to extend for a long time, it is scheduled to officially end at the end of October, so as to come to a conclusion. At that time, if the owner does not perform the registration again without stating a legitimate reason, it will be regarded as ownerless land and dealt with according to law. This is a necessary procedure in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>In the former concession period of this city, most people were happy to trade because they believed that the deed was a sure title. It was really a psychological illusion due to excessive trust in foreigners. How can it be said that the property right is certain if the deed does not match the land? Moreover, if the power is in the hands of foreigners, the property rights lack guarantee, and the outflow of rights and interests is an immeasurable loss to the country. Therefore, this city's land registration also cleans up the deed land. Anyone who has actually transferred property to the Chinese people will be considered the owner of the actual right, so as to avoid being controlled by foreigners and harming the rights and interests of the Chinese people. However, the chaos of the land registration in this city after a hundred years of special status of the concession and eight years of occupation can be imagined. It is indescribable how difficult it is to carry out a general cleanup at this time. It is hoped that all citizens will work together to achieve success. Then, the active land finance and the rapid progress of construction projects in this city can be expected from this.</p>
<h3>Baoding Dynamics</h3>
<p>— A special correspondent Yang Bingsen, this newspaper, September 4th.</p>
<p>Starting from Beiping and boarding the Pinghan train, you can reach Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province, in four hours. This ancient city, with a radius of only five kilometers and a population of less than 120,000, is probably the smallest provincial capital in the country.</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway, which runs diagonally, and the Daqing River, which runs between Tianjin and Baoding, are its two major arteries, controlling the province's political, cultural, and military hub.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, this place was the first to be occupied. After struggling under the iron hooves of the enemy for eight years, Baoyang after the catastrophe showed signs of depression, fear, paralysis, and tension. It was like an insect that had just escaped from the darkness and was slowly moving towards the light.</p>
<p>Paralyzed Education</p>
<p>Baoding is the educational center of Hebei Province. In terms of provincial units across the country, its educational development is second only to Jiangsu. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were two provincial colleges, Hebei Agricultural and Medical College. There were also Yucheng, Tongren, Peide, Minsheng, Zhicun, Baozhong, vocational schools, men's and women's normal schools, etc. In addition, there were more than 50 public and private primary schools. However, during the occupation, after the enemy's devastation, it suffered unprecedented misfortune. Some schools were transformed by the enemy into barracks, wounded soldier hospitals, and residences, or even demolished and used as firewood. It was unbearable to hear and see the damage. After the victory, all schools actively resumed classes. Currently, in addition to taking over the pseudo-normal college and continuing to run it, Baozhong, men's and women's normal schools, Yucheng, and Tongren have all resumed classes one after another. The Agricultural and Medical College is also scheduled to start classes after the summer vacation this year.</p>
<p>However, the re-established schools are barely operating due to funding reasons, and equipment is extremely lacking, especially the general science instruments that require experiments. Some schools do not even have one piece. Teachers can only talk and draw, and students can only watch and listen. The terms molecular formula and carbon dioxide often cause confusion.</p>
<p>The poverty of civil servants and teachers is a common phenomenon across the country, especially in Baoding, which is even more bitter. The old masters in private schools only have 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per month, which is not enough to maintain one person's life, let alone have the energy to diligently teach students. Low prices will naturally not buy good goods, so it is difficult to hire good teachers in Baoding. Due to the meager treatment, the teachers who taught here also staged a tragedy of striking in May, accompanied by Shenyang, Pingjin, and other places.</p>
<p>After the Provincial Government Moved</p>
<p>After the news that the Jisu Provincial Government would move from Pingjin to Baoding spread to Baoding, every corner of the city was filled with vitality, as if giving these 100,000 people living under tension an injection of stimulants. From May, the slogan "Move to Baoding" was shouted for two months, but because the office buildings and staff dormitories were not enough to apply, it was delayed. Therefore, the first batch of personnel who came to Baoding only spent a month surveying the site and investigating official and private reverse properties before they were completely moved to Baoding in mid-July.</p>
<p>Most changes in everything are unpredictable. The citizens of Baoding looked forward to the provincial government's move to Baoding, imagining that the city would flourish due to the increase in population and consumption; however, the income of civil servants was limited, and both public and private were generally poor. Where was there any extra energy to squander and consume, so the market was still lifeless, and it was a waste of joy.</p>
<p>Even more unexpected, bad air blew on these provincial government officials, arousing a wave of injustice:</p>
<p>The treatment of provincial government officials in Beiping was paid according to the central government's regulations for the Pingjin area. After moving to Baoding, not only was the environment lower, but the salary was also changed to the Jisu provincial area treatment, which was 180 times different from the Pingjin treatment. An ordinary official earned 70,000 to 80,000 yuan less. In fact, prices in Baoding are not lower than in Pingjin. Except for food, which is slightly cheaper, the general necessities of life are more than one-third higher. Officials are naturally dissatisfied, so the entire federation elected representatives to send a telegram to the central government, hoping that the treatment would be reasonably adjusted, and they also planned to send representatives to the capital.</p>
<p>The citizens of Baoding are now indifferent to the provincial government's move to Baoding, but the only comfort is that due to the provincial government's move, security has been strengthened, reducing a layer of threat!</p>
<p>The security in Baoding has always been fluctuating until today. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Outside the city of Baoding, twenty or thirty miles away, it is still a "liberated area." The only trick of the Communist army against Baoding is, of course, the blockade of materials, so the residents of the city often feel the lack of food and the pressure of food prices.</p>
<h3>Tianjin's Autumn</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Tianjin Navigation News, September 14th, a special reporter Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Autumn comes silently and leaves silently. The bright, white moonlight still shines quietly into this city, but the people who live in this city have long lost the sentiment of the past. Those who are displaced, whose families are broken, and who are breathing under the heavy pressure of life are naturally more emotional, and even those who are leisurely and affluent feel that this autumn is very different from before the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The fresh goods store is piled with red pomegranates, purple grapes, golden-yellow American oranges, and pears that look crisp, all of which highlight the existence of autumn.</p>
<p>Difficult to do business, high interest rates</p>
<p>The day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the mooncakes were sold out, and the patrons in the fresh goods store were also coming and going, handing over large amounts of banknotes. Of course, few of these patrons are poor civil servants. There are certainly many merchants who make money, but how can there be no merchants who lose money? When it comes to festivals, merchants are accustomed to settling accounts, and there is a need for more cash, so the secret interest rate rises with the wind. The highest even reaches 90 yuan per day, which is equal to 27% per month. How can small merchants stand under this situation? It is precisely because of the tight money supply. In the past few days, except for things that should be in season, other prices have not changed much, but how many people are anxious about the situation after the festival? Prices are difficult to stabilize. Listen to the merchants' complaints, they all have a belly full of grievances. They all say that the things they sell do not increase in price first, but rather chase after other prices. What exactly is leading the price increase? The merchants also know that it is the overall situation. A well-behaved merchant does not want prices to rise.</p>
<p>Some are happy, some are sad</p>
<p>These days, after several autumn rains, the golden wind is rising, and the cold is coming in gusts, bringing Tianjin into late autumn. During the Anti-Japanese War, people who were drifting away from their hometowns could not go back. After the victory, thousands and thousands of people were forced out of their hometowns by the riots, but kind people are not necessarily weak. A few days ago, the people of the various counties south of Tianjin who were displaced in Tianjin established a return home association. Thousands of people from various counties who were displaced in Tianjin actively participated in this group. They want to return to their hometowns armed. In central Hebei and eastern Hebei, the movement of people returning to their hometowns has also developed vigorously. They want to return to their native land, cultivate their fields, and live in their houses. Although there are people trying to stop them? They are kind people who only hope to restore their past peaceful lives.</p>
<p>The autumn wind blows across the fields, into the city, and into people's hearts. Last autumn, the 1.5 million citizens of Tianjin completely jumped into the joy of victory. This autumn, the people have fallen into the threat of war again. "Some are happy, some are sad"? Really, there are too few people who can be happy, and there are too many people who are sad!</p>

<h3>Founding Documents</h3>
<p>— From our newspaper's archives</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the feudal autocracy that had lasted for thousands of years and established a democratic republic. This was an unprecedented and important turning point in the history of the Chinese nation. Here, we excerpt some important documents from the founding era. They do not lose their value due to the passage of time because they are eternal milestones on the road to nation-building.</p>
<p>President Sun's Inaugural Declaration</p>
<p>[At the beginning of the creation of the Republic of China, I, with my lack of virtue, assumed the responsibility of Provisional Grand President, being fearful day and night that I would not live up to the expectations of the people. The poison of autocratic politics in China has grown worse over the past two hundred years. Once removed by the power of the people, it took only a few dozen days for the uprising to restore more than ten provinces. Since the beginning of history, there has never been such a rapid success. The people entrusted me with the responsibility of organizing the government. From the perspective of pushing merit and yielding ability, I dare not take on this task. From the perspective of serving and fulfilling my responsibilities, I dare not refuse. The foundation of a country lies in its people. Uniting the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan lands into one country is the unification of the nation. The Wuchang Uprising caused more than ten provinces to declare independence successively. The so-called independence is separation from the Qing court and unity with the provinces. This is the unification of territory. The sound of the bell of blood rang out, and the flags of righteousness rose in all directions. Soldiers armed with armor and weapons were everywhere in more than ten provinces. Although the organization may not be uniform, and the commands may not be consistent, the objectives are the same. This is the unification of military administration. The country is vast, and each province has its own customs. In the future, the administration should aim to properly regulate the relationship between the central government and the provinces. Once the outline is established, the details will follow. This is the unification of internal governance. The country's finances are derived from the people. It is essential to conform to the principles of public finance, and especially to improve the social and economic organization, so that the people can know the joy of life. This is the unification of finance. The above are the policy guidelines. Proceeding with these, there will be no major mistakes. As for revolutionary doctrine, it is what we advocate and what the United States understands. Although it has been repeatedly frustrated in the past, foreigners have always appreciated its intention. Since August, the flags of righteousness have been flying, and the friendly nations have held peaceful hopes and maintained a neutral stance towards it, while newspapers and public opinion have often expressed their sympathy. The virtue of neighborly friendship is deeply appreciated. After the establishment of the provisional government, we should maintain a peaceful doctrine and further increase friendly relations with our friendly nations, so that China will be respected in the international community, and the world will gradually move towards great harmony. Progress should be made in an orderly manner, not by seeking quick gains. This is the true external policy. Now, on the day of our first meeting with the people, I lay out my heart. I hope that our four hundred million compatriots will learn from it.]</p>
<p>Provisional Grand President's Letter to Friendly Nations</p>
<p>"Since the Manchus seized power, they have used supreme authority to impose unreasonable oppression, restricting civil rights and violating public opinion, thus delaying the intellectual, moral, and economic progress of our Republic of China. Those with insight believe that only revolution can sweep away the old filth and revitalize the new opportunity. Now, fortunately, the righteous flag has been raised high and the general situation has been determined. We, the entire Republic of China, dare to proclaim to our friendly nations that we have overthrown the autocratic government of the Manchu Qing and established a republican nation.</p>
<p>Replacing the monarchical system with a republic is not merely a momentary whim of our people. The idea of freedom bestowed by heaven has long been cherished. Seeking lasting happiness and sweeping away obstacles in the future, we have cherished this humble desire for a long time without achieving it. Today's events are a natural outcome, and also the formal expression of the public will of our Republic.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is inherently peaceful and law-abiding. Only when compelled by self-defense will we lightly initiate war. Therefore, since the Manchu Qing stole China, for 268 years, their administration has been unspeakable. Our nation could only endure it, and did not initially want to see the tragedy of bloodshed. We have risen up and fallen repeatedly, and have ultimately failed to achieve our goal. As of today, we can no longer endure it, so we resort to force, hoping to free ourselves and our descendants from myriad fetters, and to allow freedom and happiness to illuminate the universe. This is a rare opportunity that may not come again in a thousand years.</p>
<p>The policy of the Manchu Qing government, in a word, is one of jealousy towards other races, selfishness, and unchanging misgovernment. We have endured it for too long, and are forced to revolt, which is only natural. Demolishing the old system and establishing a new nation is something we cannot help but do, and we ask the free nations of the world to clearly understand this.</p>
<p>Before the Manchu Qing usurped the divine regalia, the civilized nation of the Xia allowed all countries of the world freedom of communication, travel, and the propagation of doctrines. When the Ming Dynasty lost power, the Manchu barbarians seized control. Based on their narrow-mindedness and selfish prejudices, they enacted various decrees to isolate themselves, preventing the civilization of China from contacting the nations of the world. This caused the descendants of the divine race to become increasingly vulgar, making it difficult to develop their natural talents. Stupefying the people is not only a barrier to humanity, but also a public enemy of civilized nations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Manchu Qing government, in order to keep the majority of Han people forever subjugated under their autocracy, so that they could possess wealth and multiply among them, did not hesitate to harm our people for their own benefit. Close relatives of the clan often possessed special privileges, and the majority of common people were subject to their control. They also levied exorbitant and illegal taxes, arbitrarily extorting and plundering. Obstructing the development of domestic commerce and hindering the flourishing of industry and manufacturing, the Manchu Qing government did not know how to reward and protect real industries.</p>
<p>As for employing people and administering government, there were no impartial and unchanging norms. Harsh punishments and cruel systems were inhumane. Offices and titles were sold, and politics was achieved through bribery. Imperial edicts were issued in the morning and violated in the evening, making fools of our people time and time again, causing our country and people to be despised by the world, to which they were indifferent.</p>
<p>We now want to eliminate all the aforementioned crimes, so that our Republic of China can establish equal and friendly relations with all nations of the world. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to fight against the evil government and establish a better one to replace it. We therefore lay this bare before all nations. May our friendly nations take note. Signed, Sun Wen, Provisional Grand President of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Military Governor of Hubei's Letter to the Manchu Government</p>
<p>"To all officials of the Manchu Government: Due to the haste of military affairs, I have been unable to send a letter of greeting. Thinking of you in the wind, I am ashamed beyond words. The land of the Central Plains belongs to our Han people. They braved frost and dew, cut through thorns and brambles, to possess this Divine Land. When the rebels usurped power, the Qing dynasty falsely claimed to be providing aid, proclaiming the great cause of suppressing the rebels, broke and routed the rebels, and stole and occupied Yanjing. Thus, the land of refined attire and civilization was ruined from within, and the descendants of the Chinese gods were plunged into barbarism. Whenever I read history to this point, I have never failed to close the book and sigh, my heart aching and blood flowing. When I secretly read the letter from Dorgon to Shi Kefa, it still said that our dynasty possessed Yanjing, which it obtained from the rebels, not taken from the Ming Dynasty. Alas! Who are you trying to deceive with these words? Are you trying to deceive Heaven? The false dynasty used barbarians to disrupt the Xia, stole the divine regalia, falsely adopted their politics and education, changed their attire, and disrupted their rituals, artifacts, and systems. They pre-established garrisons in key locations in each province, used writing to create prisons, and implicated the innocent. In their appointments, Manchus occupied eight or nine out of ten positions in the inner cabinet, while Han Chinese occupied only two or three out of ten positions in the outer provincial governor positions. In their collection of taxes, they extracted every ounce of tax and grain from the Han Chinese, while the Manchus sat and ate public funds, spending it like mud and sand. In their establishment of systems, they clearly demarcated the boundaries between Manchus and Han Chinese, with no intermarriage. In their promulgation of laws, a Manchu who killed a Han Chinese was fined twenty-four taels of silver, while a Han Chinese who injured a Manchu would have to pay with his life and affect his wife and children. Such inequalities are too numerous to count. This is why benevolent people and people with ambition are increasingly indignant and dissatisfied. Thirty people opposed the nationalization of roads, which was a foolish loyalty to the country. The officials were unaware and said, 'Kill them without question,' and 'Public sentiment is rampant.' What is even more strange is that the muddleheaded, greedy and wolfish Rui Cheng even declared that the Hubei army was not reliable and ordered the confiscation of guns and ammunition, which were then given to the banner troops, who defended day and night as if facing a formidable enemy. There was no trouble, but he deliberately created alarm to shock the public. This caused great anger among the people. In addition, they arrested the innocent and executed them. Our compatriots, who had long cherished the ambition of restoration, seized this opportunity of cruelty and inhumanity to raise their arms and rain down bullets. The flag of righteousness was raised, and the Manchu slaves fled, and the traitorous ringleaders escaped. This was due to the bravery and courage of our Han people, but it also showed that the fate of the false dynasty was exhausted. Now, the military spirit is angry and brave, and they are preparing for war with all their might, repeatedly requesting to cross the Yellow River north and strike directly at Yanjing. If the officials truly cherish the race and love their unrighteousness, they should advise them to cut off their title, return to their fief, and pay tribute. I will not seek a reputation for repeated massacres. If they are attached to their isolated city and hesitate, the great army will gather in an instant, and the ugly race will have no survivors. There is no need to count the number of those who will be defeated. Consider the advantages and disadvantages, gentlemen. The clouds and sky are vast, and it is tiring to wait. The letter does not fully express my meaning."</p>
<p>Shanghai Military Government Circular Telegram</p>
<p>"Recently, the North-South Military Unification Association sent the following telegram: 'This time, the people's demand for a republic relies on the power of the military everywhere. From an autocratic era, it has changed to a republican era. This is a great event unprecedented in thousands of years, and the happiness of hundreds of millions of compatriots. Moreover, the republic will be promulgated soon, and the North and South will jointly elect a provisional Grand President to organize a provisional new government. Domestic and foreign affairs are in a state of flux, and our military colleagues should invigorate their spirits, take the lead in advocating, eliminate private prejudices, and assist the unified Grand President in organizing a strong and complete new government, to stand on the globe as the most powerful and influential Republic of China. What is concerning is that if the North and South military factions establish their own parties and kill each other, it will not only provide an excuse for the monarchist party, but also cause the situation to deteriorate and affect foreign affairs, which will inevitably lead to disaster, which will be more powerful than that caused by the monarch. Is this the original intention of our military to hope for a republic? Thinking in anger and fearing, I am uneasy day and night, and I believe that in this transitional era of overthrow and construction, our North and South soldiers must cooperate and unite, organize a group, and first use the three major principles as the scope, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After the Qing court announces the republic, when the central unified new government is established, it must obey the orders of the unified government.</p>
<p>(2) Restore peace and order in all localities.</p>
<p>Protect the lives and property of foreigners.</p>
<p>The above three principles are the obligations that our North and South soldiers should fulfill and should be uniformly observed. All procedures are planned to be discussed in detail by the officers of both sides after the establishment of the Military Unification Association, and then submitted to the unified government for approval. Those who do not comply will be considered public enemies of the civilized army, which is of great benefit to the future of the Chinese republic. If you express sympathy, please inform all military compatriots and inform us of the names and titles of the gentlemen who support this. In addition to telegraphing to the northern armies, we hope for a prompt reply. 'Etc. The reasons for relaying it are in line, and we hope that you will check it without limit. Military Governor of Shanghai Chen Qimei, respectfully.'</p>
<h3>Reconstruction Service in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Chongqing air mail report, September 17, by San Zhen</p>
<p>"Social service" is a common and ordinary work in Europe and the United States, but it is rare in China. In the past, there were some sporadic performances of work, but they did not give a deep impression to the vast number of people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, its development was hindered due to the limitations of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Although the government tried its best to promote it and established several social service agencies, it ultimately did not attract the attention of the general public and failed to achieve its intended purpose due to the neglect of various sectors of society.</p>
<p>Constant Civil Strife Torments the Souls Returning Home</p>
<p>The Chongqing Social Service Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs was one of the first organizations established in the country to serve the people. Thanks to five years of continuous efforts and continuous improvements, it has laid a good foundation. Social apartments, job placement, standard meals, movie theaters, etc., provide people in the temporary capital with a new impression at low prices and with enthusiastic service. At the same time, it has also become a source of praise and memories for every visitor to Chongqing.</p>
<p>"Victory Reconstruction" and "Returning Home" delighted the wanderers who had been away from home for eight years, but also tormented the millions of souls who urgently needed to return home. Transportation, whether by water, land, or air, was like suffering from severe suffocation due to the painful sacrifices of the past eight years and the constant civil strife of the past year, hindering the return of those returning home and shattering the distant dream of reconstruction. Hundreds of thousands of wanderers in Chongqing were anxious all day long, wandering all day long, looking at the rolling river and the blue sky, only with melancholy, only with sighs!</p>
<p>Fortunately, they bought boat tickets and were assigned to flight seats. However, problems still lined up in front of people. The handling of luggage, the solution of food and lodging, etc., were all brain-racking and heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>Octagonal Red Pavilion Arouses Interest of Returning People</p>
<p>Thus, "Reconstruction Service Stations" were established under the planning of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the promotion of the Chongqing Social Service Office. They were found in airports, bus stations, and ferry terminals. The octagonal red kiosks were eye-catching and appeared in front of every returning person.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the service station at the airport first. Chongqing was originally a mountain city with no flat ground. In addition to a small airport on the sand of the Yangtze River, the other two were still in the countryside twenty or thirty kilometers away from the city. Baishiyi has become the only airport for those returning to the capital. Therefore, the "Baishiyi Reconstruction Reception Center of the Social Service Office" also serves the millions of people returning to the capital with a grand scale and scientific management.</p>
<p>Because the airport is too far from the city, and most of the planes returning to Beijing take off at dawn, the Reconstruction Reception Center has specially contracted a car company in the city to pick up and drop off passengers four times a day. Inside the airport, it has built a dormitory that can accommodate 300 people, which is divided into group dormitories for dozens of people, small dormitories for seven or eight people, single dormitories for one or two people, and women's dormitories specially set up for women.</p>
<p>In addition to free dormitories, the use of hot and cold water and the handling of luggage do not cost passengers a penny. In addition, it also provides books, newspapers, and magazines, and holds lawn evening parties to relieve passengers of the loneliness of the journey.</p>
<p>In terms of food, there is the "standard meal" that the Social Service Office has enjoyed a long-standing reputation in Chongqing for five years. One rice, one dish, and one soup are enough for one person and enough for one person's nutrition. The cost is only 400 yuan in national currency per meal. This amount is not enough for half a movie ticket in Chongqing?</p>
<p>Even if You Spent Money, You Wouldn't Receive Such Hospitality</p>
<p>Perhaps, we would think of its simple equipment and poor hospitality because of the free accommodation. Here, it will not only exceed our imagination, but also surprise us! As long as people returning to Beijing from Baishiyi will recall the white bedding, neat furniture, and dignified and generous layout in the dormitory, and the polite waiters. Even if you spent money, you wouldn't be able to find such a hotel in Chongqing!</p>
<p>Service stations were set up in every reconstruction route in the city, such as stations and docks. The main task of each service station is to pick up and drop off luggage for guests. The original plan included long-distance and short-distance, but due to the difficulty of transportation, only short-distance transportation is currently handled. Take Chaotianmen as an example: Because Chaotianmen is the meeting place for those who take ferries east to return home, hundreds of thousands of pieces of luggage and public goods flow here from all over the world every day. The service station transports this batch of luggage to the ships taken by each passenger.</p>
<p>As for the registration of reconstruction vehicle tickets and the management of the sale of reconstruction wooden boats, it provides great assistance to those returning home. Those returning home from Sichuan and Shaanxi, Sichuan and Hunan, the southwest, and those taking wooden boats to the east will never forget this enthusiastic service.</p>
<p>Service stations of the same nature have also been set up in Yichang, Hankou, and Nanjing, and more service stations will gradually appear before our eyes in coordination with the return home by Yonglu.</p>
<p>I wish there were thousands of service stations widely set up, so that all returning people would be happy!</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Wuchang Uprising</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>As early as 1885 (the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), the Sino-French War occurred, and our country was defeated. Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply felt the corruption of the internal affairs and the invasion of imperialism, so he cherished the ambition to overthrow the Qing court and establish the Republic of China. In 1894 (the twentieth year of Guangxu), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Mr. Sun established the Revive China Society in Honolulu. The following year, he launched the first uprising in Guangzhou, which failed. In 1905 (the thirty-first year of Guangxu), the Revolutionary Alliance was established in Tokyo. Subsequently, there were ten uprisings, including the Pingli Uprising, the Chaozhou Uprising, the Second Huizhou Uprising, the Qinlian Uprising, the Zhennanguan Uprising, the Second Qinlian Uprising, the Hekou Uprising, the Anqing Uprising, the Second Guangzhou Uprising, and the Huanghuagang Uprising on March 29, 1911 (the third year of the Xuantong reign). Only after ten failures was the Wuchang Uprising successful.</p>
<p>At that time, in order to ease the development of the revolutionary movement, the Qing court declared its intention to prepare for constitutionalism in 1906 (the thirty-second year of Guangxu), and promulgated the Outline of the Constitution in 1908. However, the power of legislation and justice still remained with the royal family, and the people had no freedom to speak of. In 1911 (the third year of the Xuantong reign), the Qing court promulgated the so-called "Nationalization of Railways" policy, which was tantamount to handing over national interests to foreigners, causing resistance from people across the country. The provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong successively organized railway protection associations. Overseas Chinese students in the United States and students studying in Japan also sent telegrams in response. The Qing court not only rejected the people's demands but also used force to suppress them, appointing Zhao Erfeng as the Governor-General of Sichuan, slaughtering the people, and arousing popular outrage. Members of the Revolutionary Alliance then contacted the new army in Wuchang and agreed to launch an uprising on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of that year. Unexpectedly, Rui Cheng, the Governor-General of Huguang, received a secret report beforehand, saying that the revolutionaries would take action during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so he ordered martial law. For a time, the wind howled and every plant seemed to be a soldier. On the twentieth day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year (October 11, 1911, Gregorian calendar), this newspaper recorded the situation in Hubei at that time, saying: "The province of Hubei is closely guarding against revolutionary parties who are instigating soldiers to rebel. Martial law is extremely strict. Yesterday, it was heard that the Commissioner of Police had received a secret edict from the Governor of Hubei, saying: 'The revolutionaries are generally carrying umbrellas (with sharp blades hidden in the handles) and leather bags (with bombs stored inside). Their clothing is no different from ordinary people, but they wear short garments underneath, in two colors, blue and white. Most of these people have cut their hair and are wearing fake queues.' Immediately, secret orders were issued to police at all places and city gates to be vigilant. If there are suspicious persons, search them immediately. Therefore, those carrying umbrellas and leather bags have been frequently questioned and searched by the police in recent days, causing great disturbance to the people. The day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Governor's Office was even more heavily guarded. In addition to deploying the military police隊, special police隊, fire brigade隊, patrol police軍, and security隊 inside and outside the Governor's compound, a team of infantry and a team of cavalry from the Eighth Division were also stationed outside the compound. Rui Cheng originally suspected that the army was in alliance with the revolutionaries and did not want to use them, but Zhang Biao strongly requested, saying: 'Even if other types of troops are dispatched to guard the Governor's compound instead of using the army, the soldiers are of mixed quality, and not everyone has joined the revolutionary party. If suspicion and doubt are openly shown, the morale of the army will be even more confused, and it will be easier for villains to instigate them. It is better to choose the most reliable ones and send them to guard, in order to reassure the public.' Rui Cheng agreed. Therefore, three teams were selected from these three types of troops to be stationed in the compound. The newly selected soldiers were all recommended by the squad officer and platoon leader. If there were any other changes, only those squad officers, etc., would be held responsible. The government officially stated that this martial law was due to telegrams from the Governor of Guangdong, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, saying: Huang Xing, the ringleader of the revolutionaries, has led his party to Hubei, and they are scheduled to launch an uprising on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was based on a note from the British Minister in Beijing and a secret telegram from the Minister Plenipotentiary stationed in Japan, stating that the revolutionaries in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and other places have disguised themselves and crossed the border, and it is heard that they will take action in Wuchang."</p>
<p>The revolutionaries and the new army, seeing that the opportunity had been leaked and the defenses were strict, originally planned to postpone the uprising until the twenty-fifth day. Unexpectedly, party members Ding Hutang, Liu Rukui, Chen Hualong, Peng Chufan, Yang Hongsheng, and others were suddenly arrested in Hankou on the seventeenth day. The list of party members, with the names of soldiers from various battalions, was also seized. Ding and others were executed on the spot. It was also heard that Rui Cheng would investigate them one by one according to the list, and everyone was in danger. Therefore, at 9:00 p.m. on the eighteenth day, the artillery and engineering teams in the new army, who sympathized with the revolution, opened fire and launched the uprising. This newspaper also had a daily account of the situation on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year (i.e., October 19, 1911, Gregorian calendar): "The revolutionaries originally planned to launch the uprising at 3:00 a.m. on the nineteenth day, using cannons as a signal. They would first kill the Manchu soldiers of a certain battalion of the 30th Regiment (Manchus occupied the majority of that battalion), and then attack the Governor's Office and the Provincial Administration Office. Unexpectedly, before the time arrived, a civilian's house on Sima Road outside the Wusheng Gate suddenly suffered an accident. The artillery, cavalry, and transport battalions outside the city suspected it was a signal fire. First, the transport team shot and killed their team officer and marched out in formation. The artillery and cavalry teams followed them, broke through the city and entered. The battalions inside the city immediately occupied the gunpowder depot and the arsenal. The Han Chinese of the 29th Regiment and the Manchu soldiers of the 30th Regiment exchanged fire, causing casualties on both sides. Later, the artillery team entered the city and attacked together, causing the Manchu soldiers to collapse completely, with corpses lying everywhere. They then besieged the Governor's Office, with the artillery team using seven heavy artillery pieces to bombard directly from Snake Mountain, turning the surrounding area into ruins. All the soldiers wore white cloth on their left arms, and their slogan was 'Working together with one heart'."</p>
<p>On the night of the 19th (October 10, 1911, Gregorian calendar), the revolutionary army captured the Governor's Office, drove away Rui Cheng, the Governor-General of Huguang. Rui Cheng fled into the "Chu Yu" warship and escaped to Hankou, begging the consuls of various countries to use warships to bombard the revolutionary army, but to no avail. So he simply ran away and later sneaked into Shanghai, where he was arrested by Zhang Renjun, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, and sent to Beijing for punishment.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year, representatives of the National Army gathered at the Consultative Bureau, with no less than tens of thousands of people attending. They elected Li Yuanhong (Songqing) as the Military Governor of Hubei and issued a proclamation to reassure the people. The original text is as follows: "Proclamation by Li, Military Governor of the Hubei Army of the Republic of China: This Military Governor has expelled the Manchus and restored the Han people. All my compatriots should strictly observe order and not violate military law. All articles of punishment and reward are listed below: Those who harbor Manchus will be beheaded; those who harbor spies will be beheaded; those who engage in unfair trade will be beheaded; those who harm foreigners will be beheaded; those who disrupt commerce will be beheaded; those who rape, kidnap, burn, and kill will be beheaded; those who incite strikes will be beheaded; those who disobey the righteous army will be beheaded; those who willingly contribute grain and pay will be rewarded; those who protect concessions will be rewarded; those who guard churches will be rewarded; those who lead the masses to surrender will be rewarded; those who persuade villagers will be rewarded; those who report enemy intelligence will be rewarded; those who maintain commerce will be rewarded. August, the 4609th year of the Yellow Emperor's Era."</p>
<p>The people's army took advantage of the victory to attack, and the Qing soldiers retreated without fighting. The three towns of Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou were all occupied by the people's army. At the same time, revolutionary party members in various provinces, upon hearing the news, rose up in response. Within only one month, more than ten provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, successively declared independence. The allied forces of the people's armies of various provinces captured Nanjing, and then organized a provisional government in Nanjing. Representatives from seventeen provinces elected Mr. Sun Yat-sen as the Provisional President, designating it as the first year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was dire, the Qing court reappointed Yuan Shikai to form a cabinet and negotiate peace with the people's army, sending Tang Shaoyi as the peace negotiator. The representative of the people's army was Wu Tingfang. The two sides held a meeting in Shanghai. Later, Tang resigned, and Yuan directly negotiated with the representatives of the people's army via telegram. On February 12 of that year, the peace treaty was concluded, the Qing Emperor abdicated, and the Xinhai Revolution was successfully concluded.</p>
