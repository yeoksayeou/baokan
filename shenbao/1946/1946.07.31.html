<h3 id="c1">馬帥昨離牯返京　將邀周恩來赴廬商談　美大使遵醫囑休養中 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺三十日電〕馬歇爾特使卅日下午二時五十分冒雨離牯嶺赴潯，乘機返京。卅日中午十二時半，馬帥夫婦至主席行轅辭行，主席曾留午餐，飯後馬帥並至美使館，往訪休息中之司徒大使，談約一刻鐘辭出，皮參軍宗敢與馬帥同機返京，聞本週五可再來牯嶺。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕馬歇爾特使，三十日下午離牯返京，抵大較塲機塲時，已七時零五分，於七時半返抵行館。同行抵京者，僅其隨從副官等三人。馬帥抵京時間雖已甚遲，然各方已密切注意其與共黨代表之接見，傳馬帥返京後，將邀約共產黨代表周恩來赴廬山，且首先轉達數日來在山上與蔣主席所商談之結果，以爲繼續商談之依據，唯迄至晚十一時，周恩來尚未接獲馬帥之約會，故正式接見，可能定爲明晨十時。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕據某權威人士告本報記者，日前京滬報紙所載，軍事三人會議即將在南京或牯嶺舉行一說，純出臆測，因軍事三人會議之主要任務，在研討整軍方案之如何實施，而目前共黨對此尚未顯示其應有之誠意，所謂會議即將舉行一說，未免言之過早。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕司徒大使昨晚又高熱至三十九度，昨夜且曾出微汗，惟今晨已見好轉，下午體溫退至三十七度。馬帥於下午一時半偕同方由京來牯之美軍醫官哈比斯，美使館醫官浦克二人爲司徒大使診治，騐血結果，診斷病况並不嚴重。大使現遵醫囑，多事休息，少進食物，今日除曾用少量之橘汁及液體飲料外，並未進食。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅日電〕蔣主席對司徒雷登大使政躬運和，至爲繫念，除派侍從醫官代爲診治，並派員前往慰視外，今又贈橘汁數瓶。又馬歇爾元帥於離牯前，電邀在京之美籍名醫二人，已於卅日抵牯，爲大使治療，渠等診斷結果，與國府侍從醫官之診斷報告完全一致，發覺大使並無任何病象，僅消化不良而已。蓋大使以七三高齡，僕僕於氣溫相差廿度之京牯兩地，足以影響其消化也。司徒大使今遵醫囑，仍在旅邸休養。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕共軍昨日竟日猛攻徐州東南地帶，用其攻陷魚溝，朝陽集之全力，繼續向西進逼，國軍奮勇堵擊，戰事激烈。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣三十日電〕我向曲塘進展部隊連日與共軍不斷有激戰，據此間軍方表示，曲塘之收復，僅時間問題，會師海安，指日可待。海安方面共軍約有五個團，國軍如皋前進某部配合某部友軍，推進至柴灣以北，刻向海安挺進中。又如皋黃橋間公路業已暢通無阻。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣廿九日電〕據悉：共軍在東榆公路綫上有十餘萬之衆，調動甚繁，其老巢東台一地即集有十餘團，並大砲二百餘門，海安曲塘共軍均在加強工事，俾圖久守，另以零星部隊加緊騷擾國軍後方。一般預料，共軍此種部署，係在準備再度發動大規模進攻。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣廿九日電〕姜堰以東及以北發現共軍三團，有犯姜堰企圖，國軍已派隊搜索，泰縣境內之故寶莊，老　莊一帶，並有共軍及民兵騷擾。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江卅日電〕據揚州電話，共軍自從天長失利後，揚州西北地區，日來又趨緊張。邵伯南喬戰共軍，廿九日晚增加一營兵力，建築堅強工事，有向仙女廟進犯企圖。</p>
<p>〔中央社德高望重三十日電〕徐州東南外圍，十二八日續被共軍三萬餘，整日猛攻，其中一部已侵至朝陽集以西之古城，九集，王家集地帶，至晚國軍將犯雙溝之共軍擊退，現古城王家集地帶，戰鬥正激烈進行。五河共軍向北，圖夾攻泗縣，被國軍堵止，戰鬥亦烈</p>
<p>〔路透社南京三十日電〕報戰，毛澤東朱德於七月十日在張家口召開軍事特別會議，檢討戰局，並擬具新計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三十日電〕軍息，共軍在察北（德化）（張北）（多倫）（陽垣）等處，建築飛機塲五處，其中陽垣飛機塲規模極大。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京卅日電〕周恩來自與司徒大使談話後，今日第一次公開發表談話，謂中國全部局勢，極度嚴重。問以北平附近衝突之事，據稱：在會晤新聞記者前並無所聞，亦未見報載。關於七美兵被擄一事，謂共軍僅將其武裝解除，頗爲優待，並於最後將軍械一併送歸。中共希望美國人對共軍取友好態度，勿再發生此等事件，今日政府方面之一般反應，咸謂共軍襲擊美軍事件，係延安方面企圖引起美國輿論，驅逐美軍出境運動之擴展，共方理論以爲與美軍發生衝突，即使共軍公然侵犯，亦可產生所希望之效果。周恩來談及目前軍事政治形勢，重又要求立即全面停戰，繼以恢復交通，協定整軍方案之補充條件。據稱：馬歇爾特使與司徒大使均欲維持中國和平。周氏最後稱：渠未作赴廬山之打算。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕今日南昌力行日報廬山版對本月廿七日大公報社論「國際干涉之漸」一文，曾著論力闢其謬，並根據國際法說明去年十二月在莫斯科舉行之美英蘇三國外長會議之決議，事前中國旣未參加，事後亦從未何效力。嗣並引證近卅年來世界民族革命發展之史實，與夫國民政府在國際干涉中不斷摧毀強硬之侵略主義者，及侵略主義者走狗新舊軍閥之鮮明實例。此外復分析美軍在中國之明確任務，認爲此乃美國對於其盟友中國應行之義務，不容曲解。最後並正告大公報社論作者，謂國民政府爲了保障國家獨立，維護民族生存，有其堅決之立塲，決不是虛聲所能恫嚇。該文發表後，因立論正確，引證翔實，文筆犀利，已引起牯嶺人士極大之注意。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽卅日電〕行營宣傳處長王治民，軍調蔡宗濂，林彪代表李敏然廿九日午後四時半試談關於交換雙方被俘人員問題，政府方面主張雙方立即釋放被俘人員，李謂林彪並未授權給他，故不能全權談判，因而雖歷時甚久，但僅限於交換意見，未得若何具體結果。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽二十九日電〕李敏然此次來瀋，雖於東北問題根本意見尚有遙遠距離，但較爲平靜之現狀，或可繼續保持，蓋彼曾代林彪表示，共軍決不進攻，杜聿明亦坦白言明，只要共軍不進攻，不擾亂，國軍決不先發一槍。（二）杜聿明語記者，全盤問題，曾與李在原則上交換意見，兩日來未能產獲結果，深感遺憾。（三）瀋輸電問題，由董文琦與李敏然商獲辦法，瀋市不久可復光明，蓋此間問題能以解決，係因哈市電路在國軍控制中，此辦法商定後，兩方均無停電恐慌。</p>

<p>我國新任駐英大使鄭天錫氏方於日前抵英倫，英國新任駐華大使史蒂文森爵士也繼薛穆爵士之後，來華履任，已於昨日過滬赴京，不久即將赴牯嶺向蔣主席遞呈國書。中英邦交的新頁，眼看就要展開。</p>
<p>在此遠東局勢亟待澄淸之際，史大使來華履新，我們誠不禁寄以深切的期望。史氏不僅對於遠東問題，有特別研究與認識，而且還是一位富於經驗的外交家。英國政府任命這樣一位傑出的人物，到國際關係錯綜複雜的遠東來，辦理中英兩國間的外交事務，自然　宜也沒有了。</p>
<p>毋庸　　，在中英兩國的外交史上，　　　坐存在着　　點，大有不堪回首　　。過去滿淸政府的腐敗　國　取帝國主義　　；對於信些　點造成，應該　回　責任。但是，從國民革命軍北伐　　。二十年間，英國已漸轉變其政策，而　過此次大戰，中英兩國並　敵，更成　　雖之交。兩國的友誼，經過這次而的　煙，自必　　鞏固。在大戰期間，中英　處的地位，幾乎完全相同。中國在遠東孤軍　門，與日寇作殊死戰，英國在法國投降之後，也就成了歐洲的孤軍，而在邱吉爾首相領導之下，堅苦卓絕，百折不回，卒使整個的戰局轉危爲安。所以，中英兩國在這次大戰中，所受損失固然最大，但是對於勝利的貢獻也特多。中國完全能了解英國；英國也完全會了解中國，今年五月杪，倫敦舉行中國國旗日，英國名流學者演說，莫不盛讚中國的艱苦抗戰和對於勝利的偉大貢獻。即在戰爭勝利結束之後，中英兩國的情形，也還頗多類似之處，大家都需要「安定」，大家都需要「繁榮」。英國在戰後，雖自顧不暇，未能在物質上積極援助中國復興，但是英國朝野一致　望中國能成爲强大，統一，而民主的國家，其所懷的熱忱，並不亞於任何盟國。誠如史大使奉命之後在倫敦所說：「英國在華，除商業而外，別無其他任何野心，亟願中國成爲强大，安定，統一的國家，俾在保持世界和平之有效工具（即聯合國機構）中，能担負重要任務。英國政府當在最大可能之範圍內，盡力協助中國，務使中國成爲强大而統一的國家。」英國之所希望於中國者如此；中國之所希望於英國協助者亦不過如此。</p>
<p>由此可知，因爲戰後國際形勢的轉變，英國的對華政策，也從政治方面轉變到經濟方面去了。英國爲促進對華貿易起見，擬派遣代表團前來中國實地考察商業情形。甚至前外相艾登也表示願來中國一行，並曾在中英商會發表演說稱：「英國對於中國，懐有深切同情。中國是第一個起來抵抗侵略的國家，我們不能忘懐，也永不能忘懷；中國抵抗日本侵略，比英國抵抗侵略，爲時更長。目前國際貿易，因時局擾攘不安，困難甚多，躊躇與障得，在在可見；但各種障礙，並非不可避免者。關於英國政府派遣商務代表團前往中國一事，余亦深表贊同，實爲最適合時宜之措置，足以促進兩國貿易。」艾登可以說是眞正的中國之友了。史大使曾一度祖任艾登外相的主任秘書，對於他的見解，一定有共同的認識，而欲設法促其實現的。目下英國的金融界，固然不免有一部份人士，因見聞不週，不甚了解中國的國情，而對於中國復興建國的前途表示悲觀；但有識之士，尤其是中英商會，認識最淸楚，完金抱着樂觀的態度，堅決主張促進兩國貿易。例如該會會長彭克斯說：「英國應該盡力與中國取得經濟聯繫，即使在困難的過渡時期，也應該勞力，促進兩國貿易。」這幾天來，英國下議院也要討論中英商務關係了，我們深望英國政府能早日决定對華貿易政策，尤其是如何以資本和技術：抉助中國實業的發展。</p>
<p>英國工黨自繼保守黨之後秉政以來，已近一年，不論在其內政或外交上，無在而不採取更開明的政策。尤其在外交上，工黨政府的開明措置，是値得我們欽佩的。艾德禮首相一方面允許印度獨立，同時又宣佈英軍退出埃及，曾博得全世界的好評。所以我們對於懸而未決的香港間題，不信英國工黨政府會置之不理的。因爲香港之應歸還中國，羅邱蔣三巨頭在開羅會議時，早經决定，原則上絕無問題；而且香港仍由英國管轄，將不再是英國王冠上的一顆寳石，而已成爲中英友誼上的一層隔膜。所以我們相信，一俟時機成熟，香港問題就可進行談判而得到合理的解决。史大使道出新加坡時，也有這樣的表示。英國是民主政治的發祥地，令日的政治也最合於民主的原則；政府在內政上所採取一切的措置，悉以民意爲依歸，同樣在國際上，對於國際正義與他國的民族願望，也必特別重視。所以在史大使來華股新之際，我們特別提起一點，就是：請英國將香港九龍歸還中國，乃爲我全國一致要求的民族願望。史大使必定能够看明白，必俟洗刷了此一汚點之後，中英兩國邦交史始能有眞正嶄新的一頁。</p>

<p>— 本報駐英特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>〔七月二日倫敦通訊〕六月廿八日午夜，英國在巴勒斯坦的駐軍突然在各重要城市宣布戒嚴，禁止通行。就在這戒嚴狀態中，搜索猶人辦事處總部，及其各地的分處，逮捕猶人辦事處的執行員人，搜索猶人五辦事處所主委辦的保安隊哈卡那的非法軍械。此外並拘捕二千餘有嫌疑的猶太人，以備審訊。這事從發動之日起，至記者執筆之日止，已歷四日；但巴勒斯坦的緊張狀態並未稍弛。而各方的反響，尤其是美國方面的反響，亦未明顯，似在都等事態的繼續發展。其嚴重性是很　然的。</p>
<p>這次行動的決定出於英內閣，美國當局事先曾予通知，但並未徵詢其意見。英首相艾德禮特爲此事，於昨（七月一日）下午，在下院發表聲明，說明英政府採取此項行動的動機和決心。大意謂：巴勒斯坦的英國當局，獲有確鑿證據，證明近來巴勒斯坦的</p>
<p>恐怖行動</p>
<p>受哈卡那和猶人辦事處一部分領袖有組織的支特。英政府爲維持治安，才採取此斷然手段，目的在消滅恐怖主議的根源，並非樹敵於巴勒斯坦的整個猶人社會，希望安分猶人，繼續與當局合作，俾使當地秩序早日恢復。美國當局在採取行動前已先予通知，但並未徴詢其意見。因爲雜將治安，爲英國接受委任統治應担之責任，無需徵求他國同意。至於英美調查團的建議，現仍由英美專家繼續商談細則中。艾德禮的聲明發表後，黨內議員質問甚烈，要求政府公布猶人辦事下支持恐怖分子的證據。政府則以行動猶在繼續中爲理由，表示證據的公布尚須稍待時日。依記者觀察，巴勒斯坦恐怖行動的如此曠日持久，其恐怖分子受猶人辦事處之庇護接濟，迨無疑義，英人此次以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，襲擊猶人辦事處總部和其　屬下的武裝勢力哈下那，動機是想</p>
<p>一舉撲滅</p>
<p>恐怖行動的部根源。但問題是在效力如何？據巴勒斯坦的猶人秘密電台（現仍未破獲）廣播，他們將採取報復行動。另據猶人辦事處中未被逮捕的領袖表示，在一部分執行委員猶在拘留期間，猶人無法與當局合作。因此巴勒斯坦的緊張局面，短期內大致還不能鬆弛，至此，恐怖行動的終止希望更渺，說不定還會引起更劇烈的新恐怖行動。這當然要待局勢的發展，我們也不欲定事預測。不過無論如何，這是巴勒斯坦糾紛演變中的一個新　捩點，使英國今後與猶人妥協更爲困難，是絕無疑義的，因此我們對這此行動的意義，不妨稍加分析。我們知道巴勒斯坦目前的局面，是第一次世界大戰的結果，由國聯分派與英國委任統治的。當英軍已佔領這片土地，而所　猶米決定之時，英國有所謂</p>

<p>說英政府要爲猶太人在巴勒斯坦「準備一個民族的家園」，但以不妨害當地阿拉伯人，與散住世界各地猶人的固有福利爲限。這宣言的目的，在爭取世界的同情，使英國得繼續管理這土地，後來固然得如願以償。貝爾福宣言，亦經一九二〇年的聖里諾和會，及一九二三年的建立委治地的約章所承認採納，遂成爲英國代治這地的法定政策。猶人的大量移人，可說始於此時，尤以近年來世界各地排斥猶人的結果，猶人移入更多。目前的巴勒斯坦，約有阿拉伯人一百二十萬；猶太人六十萬左右。但因猶人的財力智力，俱在阿拉伯人之上，二方競爭，猶人優勝是勢所必然的。二者問的傾軋，因猶人移入數量之增加而日益尖銳。英國當局左右其間，有時偏袒猶太人，有時偏袒阿拉伯人，視一般情勢和英國的利益而轉變。最近因阿拉伯人民族意識的發展，和相互間的團結增强，所以對猶人的繼續移入巴勒斯坦，反抗亦漸烈。英國有鑒於此，自一九三九年起，即限制每年移入猶人的數額，並限制已移入的猶人。在若干區域內，不得購買土地。這樣，阿拉伯人的反抗雖吿靜寂，猶人的反抗却相繼而起，糾紛始終沒有轟靜過。去年十一月間，英外相貝文宣布組織</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕日前來滬之參政員羅衡在報上發表檢舉何德奎談話後，昨日本市記者復紛紛趨市府訪問何秘書長。何氏對記者所問，並未作確定性之答覆。據秘書長室中人稱：何氏靜候澈查，現尚無辭職之意。日前赴京，係應宋院長之召，羅衡所提之照片證據，確有其事，惟當時情形紊亂，環境惡劣，何氏簽署之致工部局校務處函件，意在使僞敎育委員會與校務處接洽，塡寫僞方所發之表格，避免與工部局當局找麻煩。又工部局校務處之勢力範圍，爲工部局學校，而非全市學校。函件內並無指令改用偽敎科書之意，且當時僞敎科書亦未印行何氏左右並稱：何氏在就任上海市‘副市長時，曾被召晋見蔣委員長，當時渠即表示，在外人統治下工部局任職多年，一且就任上海市副市長，恐未必能孚衆望，而委員長則勉其安心工作云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海第一大煤商，義泰興煤號股份有限公司經理沈錦洲，以漢奸嫌疑，昨日下午在高院受審。沈現年六十歲，浙江餘姚人，在滬素有「煤球大王」之稱。勝利後爲本市一百餘煤號聯名檢舉，指控罪狀三點：（一）義泰興煤號本係華商柳江煤礦鐵路股份有限公司之股東，沈於廿六年十一月串通該公司董事長祝伊才，將河北省臨檢縣柳江煤礦區之礦權礦產及鐵路等全部財產，以巨價售與敵商三井洋行。（二）太平洋戰起後，上海煤炭來源悉入敵人掌握，所有煤斤，均由日商三井·三菱·山下·開灤等公司組織之石炭聯合會統制經營，沈與大昌等十六家同業商號，集資組織大中聯煤號，沈被推爲理事長，向石炭聯合會請購煤斤，代敵執行統制政策，圖取暴利，危害民生。卅三年該煤號又改組爲大中聯煤斤統配處，沈復被推爲常務理事。（三）卅四年一月起，因敵在太平洋之戰失利，缺乏航運，大中聯乃以民船由靑島運煤來滬，半數供敵軍用，半數應市牟利，此項檢舉，經高檢處將沈扣押，偵查終結，正式提起公訴。</p>
<p>沈昨天白綢衫褲，外罩青灰長條綢袍，平頂頭，足穿黑鞋，手執白摺扇，操純粹之鄕音，答辯稱：「九一八」事變後，柳江礦被敵軍佔領，迭經祝伊才交涉無結果，延至十年後，經股東大會議決授權董事會與敵人交涉，但敵人不肯父還，祇允交付價金六十萬元，關於大中聯煤號，則並非敵偽所屬機關或團體，係私人出資合夥經營，與日人一無關係，且本人曾數度堅辭理事長職，卅三年改組爲統配處後，從未出席會議，故關於第三點指控往靑島運煤事，因已辭職，完全不知，而本人於勝利後，受本市公用局長趙曾鈺之托，接收「石炭聯」，共得五萬多噸煤斤，供本市電力公司之用，此有事後錢大鈞市長之謝兩可證明云。庭上繼傳檢舉人佟子心羅心慶到庭，據稱：與被告爲同業，並無寃仇，此次檢舉係本公義立塲，因被吿當時倚仗敵勢，統制全上海煤斤，不准自由賣買，剝削同業，危害民生，故勝利後由一百餘家同業聯名檢舉。</p>
<p>被吿之辯護律師江一平徐佐良至此亦起立滔滔辯稱：檢舉人方面有一百餘同業署名蓋章，今被吿亦有一百餘同業店號聯名保證被吿並無犯罪行爲，而聯名檢舉書騎縫處係接合者，此點甚爲可疑，請庭上注意云。並呈上有利被吿之證明文件甚多。</p>
<p>昨沈在庭上供述時，手持摺扇，指東劃西，述呼「阿彌陀佛」，「罪過」，「天曉得」。言至氣憤時，面紅耳赤，不時以手撫胸，似不勝悲愴。待審畢，庭諭改期再訊後，雙手執扇，向庭上作拱曰：「謝謝老爺」，「謝謝老爺」，與家屬親友略談數語，仍由法警押回獄中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕每日淸晨，上海的廿四個小菜場，是最喧囂骯髒混亂的所在，如何使其整齊淸潔有條不紊，實在是當務之急。據衛生局凌科長昨向記者談稱：衛生局現已制定整理菜塲之步驟四項：（一）頒發攤戶執照，目前業已大部辦理就緒。（二）調整攤位：以前菜塲中攤位排列犬牙錯雜，並無次序，按照計劃，當使其分門別類排齊。例如魚·肉·疏菜等俱將聚集一處，如此購買者可方便不少。目前已照計劃整理完竣者，已有四川北路，虹口三角地等十餘座菜塲，僅餘舟山路，西摩路等四五處尚未實行。（三）取締塲外露天菜塲：二沿馬路露天設攤，最足以妨碍交通，况灰塵遍洒，也有碍衛生，實有嚴予取締的必要。只是困難在於今日社會上難民多，失業者多，一時取締頗感不易。（四）取締塲內雜貨攤：若千菜塲內有許多非屬「小菜」範圍內之攤戶，例如賣竹器的，賣零頭布疋的，而最多數的雜攤，則是一般零食攤，按照整頓菜塲計劃，俱在取締之列。取締辦法有二：（一）命此種雜攤自動改設其他小菜攤。（二）否則令其遷讓。目前正在與各該管警局會商實施方法中。凌科長又稱，菜塲攤戶現每戶每月僅收取六百元，而每一菜塲每月管理費却高達二三十萬元，不敷甚鉅。故菜塲管理費用目前是市府事業經費之一，純粹以服務市民爲目的。</p>

<h3 id="c124">蘇北行之一　蘇北的控訴 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 本報廿八日泰縣通訊　特派員杭舟</p>
<p>蘇北—這在江蘇省內的長江以北的一大片肥沃的土地，美麗的田野，可是和中國其他所謂「解放區一一樣，當全世界人民已享受着和平安定生活的時候，那裏的人民還要流浪逃亡。中國共產黨把這一塊地區作爲奪取政權的武裝鬥爭的主要目標之一。</p>
<p>在上海，在南京，在中國別的地區的人民，已密切注視着蘇北局勢的演變了。由於蘇北和南京，上海僅一江之隔，人們開心它的程度，或許還甚於東北。自從和平談判共當以「拖」爲手段而未獲結果後，蘇北已繼東北之後，展開了最尖銳的鬥爭塲面。</p>
<p>這鬥爭，無疑的是共產黨一手製造而發動的，但共產黨的負責人却企圖一手掩盡天下人耳目，全世界人土亦迷惑於它的巧妙的宣傳，於是，蘇北幾乎成為一個謎的地方。「百聞不如一見」，爲了揭破這個謎，記者最近派作蘇北之行。</p>
<p>民眾的心情</p>
<p>七月廿日，我從上海動身，次日抵達隊北軍事的重鎭—揚州，逗留了三天，至數日前戰事最激烈的泰興視察，隨後來到了另一個軍事重鎭—泰縣。一週來，我去過的地方，不是在不久前爲共軍所騷擾，便是距共軍所利用的民兵僅咫尺之地，隨時還可聽到槍聲。歷經滄桑的居民都一致地向記者訴說：「苦難是否有盡的時候？你們做新聞記者的應該把事實的眞相向全世界宣佈，喚起廣大的制裁！」</p>
<p>蘇北民衆今日是怎樣的心情？我只寫一段親身的經歷：</p>
<p>七月廿四日，大戰後的泰興縣的宣家堡上來了一輛吉普車，載着幾個穿黃軍服的人。一個十三四歲的女孩子首先瞥見，高呼「家裏人來了！」她的聲音中跳動着喜悅。</p>
<p>我讚許地望了她一眼。可惜我沒有機會和她多談，但亦不用多談，我已經知道了她將告訴我的以往所受的痛苦，和見了「家裏人」的興奮了。</p>
<p>原來蘇北民衆普遍地稱國軍爲「家裏人」。而當新四軍來的時候，他們綳着臉，沉着心，用灰色的眼睛相互對望一下，右手在左手的掩護下伸出四個指頭，不發一語。</p>
<p>共軍三部曲</p>
<p>民國廿九年，共黨的新四軍就潛入了蘇北，那時還只有千把人，陳毅的職位尚是縱隊長。面子上他們是服從命令對抗「敵人」，暗底裏他們却是抱着一個重大的陰謀而來的。他們施行的手段是；對國軍——分化；對民衆——組織；對敵人——默契。</p>
<p>不過，共黨是不承認他們不抗日的，事實上他們的確亦抗過日，但是在這樣的情形下才發生：某地日軍只有一個連，共軍有數師之衆，兵力上，武器上都對抗得過，他們就一鼓而上，佔領了那地方。至於當日軍向他們反攻的時候，他們從無保土衛疆的觀念，爲了保全實力，可以用來對內，便迅速地「轉進」了。</p>
<p>而當國軍在與日軍作戰時，他們躱在後面擾亂，偷襲，乘火打刦，不一而足，有意無意的協助日軍，削弱國軍的力量。</p>
<p>他們在組織民衆方面，凡是年靑的人，一經組織，便算是新四軍分子了。他們把豪富者的土地掠奪過來，分配給貧窮的人，這些貧窮者自然樂得跟他們走……。就這樣，數年之內，新四軍一而十，十而百，聲勢浩大起來，正規軍之外有地方團隊，有民兵。總數有多少？有三四十萬吧！—很難說出一個確數來。</p>
<p>控制的地區，國軍僅是少數的「點」與「綫」，大量的「面」落在共軍手裏，約爲一與五之比新四軍賴國難起家，整個中國共產黨都是賴國難起家。抗戰期問，淪陷　和大後方的奸商貪官所發的國難財和共黨一比，那又是毫不是道的了。</p>
<p>無論是軍事上，經濟上，政治上，共黨在蘇北根深蒂固，自然佔有利的地位。故如果要共黨退出蘇北，那將和要共黨退出延安一樣地困難。共黨對蘇北，不僅欲保持已有的勢力，在目前複雜的國際情勢下，並且已開始利用這一地盤企圖進窺京滬，動搖國家的基地。</p>
<h3 id="c125">泰興大戰前後 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>這見諸於行動的便是最近的泰興大戰。發動之初，共黨以一向的慣技，盡力宣傳國軍將採取攻勢，混淆國際人士耳目。但明瞭大局的人，都知道共黨的宣傳無異是天方夜譚式的神話。因爲如果說國軍有所軍事行動的話，那是應付共軍的進攻。共軍要打國軍，總不能叫國軍不還手呀！</p>
<p>從地形上看，泰興在泰縣的東南，和江陰僅一江之隔。共軍情報非常靈通，他探聽得國軍在那裏只有一個團，兵力單薄，於是就秘密地抽調了十三個團的兵力，以壓倒的姿態，由新四軍第六師師長粟裕親自統率，急行軍撲向泰縣。同時，另以九團之衆攻泰興以北的重要據點宣家堡，使國軍不能救援。宣家堡的守軍亦只是一個團。</p>
<p>共軍道一戰略是相當巧妙的，如果它成功了，則今日京滬的局面將不堪設想。</p>
<p>但是它失敗了！這是出乎它意料之外的。七月十三日的傍晚，它開始進攻，把預備接收的縣長及行政人員都帶了去，告訴他們說：「四小時後，你們進去好了」。</p>
<p>瘋狂的攻擊</p>
<p>以十三與一之比，共軍前仆後繼，眞是「勇敢」之至，向泰興作狂風暴雨式攻擊。守城的爲八十三師十九旅的五十六團劉光宇團長，這是一支久經沙塲的部隊，去年湘西會戰，在雪峯山麓創造過輝煌的戰績，面對這這一羣瘋在的暴徒，沉着非常。機關槍一排排掃着，共軍批批倒下，另一批又蜂湧而上，再倒下，再上來一批，守軍的子彈完了，城門便被攻破。劉團長親率一營兵士堅守城內的慶雲寺。這慶雲寺並非鋼骨水泥所造，只是一所陳舊的寺宇，緊急中連工事都做得非常草率。然而，共軍陷了泰興的城，不能陷慶雲寺。所以實際上國軍始終未曾失去泰興。自十三日深夜迄十六日淸晨，血戰逾四十八小時，慶雲寺屹然未動。國軍雖傷亡甚多，共軍傷亡　衆。粟裕到了域裏，見到這種情形嘆一口氣說：「新四軍在蘇北沒有見過這樣頑強的軍隊」。他把劉光宇團長稱做「頑固份子中的最頑固份子」；又稱他做「劉瘋子」。劉團長同我談起時說：「我有什麼瘋？他們要打我，難道我就束手就擒不成」！</p>
<p>守軍唱國歌</p>
<p>五十六團的一個連在城破的時候衝出去，隨後又打了回來，共軍以爲國軍援兵到了，慌張起來。同時，一百師李天霞師長用電話告訴劉團長說：「泰興是你成功成仁的地方，我這革命軍人要對得起國家。你堅持下去！援兵就要來了」。這些話，給共軍偸聽了去，愈益慌張。然而在十六日晨三時許，他還發動了最後的猛攻，並且把一張字條投到慶雲寺要劉團長投降。這時兩軍已短兵相接。劉團長接到了字條，撕個粉碎，大聲說：「革命軍人是不投降的」！他和剩餘的守軍一面還擊，一面高唱國歌，大喊口號。以死相拼，準備隨時殉城。共軍一聽慶雲寺裏歌聲響澈雲霄，奇怪：「爲什麼還有那麼多人」？自知難逞。一方面又接到國軍已在進攻它的後路的消息，軍心動搖，整個崩潰。十六日晨五時許，泰興城內便沒有一個共單。</p>
<p>這戰役成功在守軍的死守，李師長的神經戰，共軍後路的抄襲與地方黨政人員及民衆的協力。薛佩琦縣長和劉團畏同守在慶雲寺，不離一步。</p>
<p>蘇北局面賴此役得以穩定。李天霞師長說：「城破而不全陷，並能以孤軍堅守一據點擊潰來犯者，收復全城。在抗戰史中都無先例。」</p>
<p>宣家堡之戰和泰興一樣激烈。於激戰兩　夜後，守軍只剩七百人，一度後撤，隨後鍾雄飛團長率這七百人又打了回去，奪回該堡。</p>
<p>兩役共軍傷亡的總數，在兩萬以上（共方自認有一萬人），國軍傷亡人數則爲其十分之一。由這點證明，共軍除賴人多之外，打還是不中用的。</p>
<p>蘇北共軍的主力經此兩役後，元氣大傷，因此，國軍收復黃橋，姜堰，都不費吹灰之力。</p>
<p>人民怕「拖」</p>
<p>「我敢說」——李天　師長說：「假使這時候，上面有命令要我掃蕩蘇北，蘇北的局面馬上就可澄淸。」</p>
<p>然而，這正是國軍的苦悶！停戰命令只是單方面在實行，國軍被這命令縛住手脚，除了爲自衛而還擊外，不能主動。但共軍却什麽時候高興便什麽時候撕破停戰協定，打國軍一下；而且他根本沒有把停戰協定看在眼裏。</p>
<p>軍事的情勢還得跟政治的情勢轉移，而政治的情勢，不幸的是拖。拖，正是共黨所希望的。拖下去，共黨可以再作部署，可以慢慢「鬥爭」，可以拖到情勢最有利的時候，再行大舉。</p>
<p>「不能够拖啊、」熱愛祖國的蘇北人民一致喊：「拖，將把我們拖到不可救拔的深淵　去了！」</p>
<p>共黨要掩蔽的事實終於不能掩蔽了！抗戰時，共黨宣傳：「我們是抗日的，你們（指政府）是不抗日的！」這說法在抗戰勝利後馬上破產了：日軍是向政府棄械投降的。於是，共然立刻一變論調而爲：「我們是民主的，你們是不民主的。」這眞令人啼笑皆非。共黨民主不民主？蘇北流亡出來的三百萬難民已經明白地告訴了你；如果還不相信，你到蘇北來看看——整個社會秩序，整個人性的毀減，那就是共黨所謂的「民主」！</p>
<p>蘇北的人民控訴：「那是虛僞的！我們要「家裏人」回來啊！」</p>

<h3 id="c126">颱風捲過臺島 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 本報七日臺灣航訊　特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>作爲台灣的特產底颱風，本年已經以十八風率初次和本省見面，而六至八風率的觸　，也襲到了上海。這大自然的狂風的波瀾，起源於高溫還是低溫，台島和菲島的天文學家還正在爭論着。本省人熟習了颱風，但當警報發響時，也不由得不心慌。現在第一次的颱風過去了，新的風向何時來襲，氣象局還無法預測，而人爲的颱風正以同樣的風速席捲全島人的心，人們現正担心着怎樣挨過歲月，又在害怕着怎樣打發和應付現實！人們說，這不自然的人爲的颱風，是內地人帶來的，它已逐漸轉變爲本省的特產了。</p>
<p>不幸的女人們</p>
<p>臺灣儘多着不幸的女人，她們以年靑，美貌和受有小學敎育的程度，散處在酒館茶樓以及舞塲裏，充作配角供顧客玩弄和逗笑，換取數百元到千元的合幣。她們之中，或是丈夫被徵去了到如今沒有消息，或是被遣散了的日本人的遺棄的，或是所有的家屬統在炸彈下犧牲了，男子們留給她挑起生活的担子，生活奪去了她們的生命，祇有在醇酒錄燈下出賣着靑春，她們是站在生活戰綫上的最前哨的鬥士。於是如今她們面臨着風雨了，當局明令七月禁舞，八月禁娼，同時取締女招待，全省幾萬個女給（女侍）都着了慌。</p>
<p>在台北，女侍們圍攻住婦女會長謝娥的辦公室，甚至鬧到公館，她們祇有一個要求：「我們要吃飯，要生活。」在高雄桃源酒家女侍　華却以自殺來抗議當局的禁令。積極的却有二百多人包圍了婦女會楊幹事和彭參議負的住宅，她們祗有一個希望，政府取締了她們的職業，她們要求救濟，要求工作。公署責成縣中，縣市責成鄕鎭，結果是禁是禁了，這批不幸的女人却落了空，要不然就是禁是禁，令是令！</p>
<p>高物價的威脅</p>
<p>颱風的另一個風力，却廣泛地吹到了有着乘車和使用水電習慣的本省人的身上。人們現在不再回想日本人時代，而是以光復當時作爲比例，最低限度的生活費是三百元，現在却得一千至二千元。第一期的米榖登塲了，米價跌到十一元一斤，可是開門七件事的另六件，却多漲了價，漲得使人們不會相信，最近本省公用事業，如郵政·電報·電燈·自來水·火車等，都紛紛加價，或決定加二倍到三倍的價，公營的生產機關的各種產品，也在紛紛漲價，報紙被迫自十八元一月漲到六十元。這對全省六百萬人直接是一個威脅，而將人民的生活更降低了。</p>
<p>任交通處長到台灣來的第一聲是將合北號交海辰輸拖到上海去修理，第二聲就是郵電·火車的增價。光是郵電一項，每月淨　一千餘萬元，過去日本人是仰賴於專賣局百分之四十的收入補助的，如今却不可能了。自一分七一度漲到五角一度的電力價格，不僅使用戶感到重壓，而小型工廠却受了嚴重的打擊，公費生產機關又不能不隨之上漲！</p>
<p>經濟家說，台灣工礦生產，主要的是電價低，工資廉，過渡時期的反常現象，使一部份廠家將保持長時期間的停頓下去吧？</p>
<p>加新·裁員·欠新</p>
<p>沒有計劃的地方官吏，到內地東拖西拉的，到台灣來凑成一個露天草台班，若干人抱着奴輩心來了，如今却忍受着回不得家鄕的沉痛。政府自五月份起加薪了，依三十三成計算，取消了津貼，實際上加不了多少，可是能够到月底拿到薪水的除了公署和工礦，農林處直屬機構外，怕沒有了吧？帶了二百六十人到台灣來的台北縣政府，五月份的薪金還只有一小部份沒發放着，七月份起據說道要打個八扣，還要裁員。敎育處最近召開全省敎育會議，各縣市的報告千篇一律，衆口同聲的說，沒有錢，小學敎師有二三月沒有拿到一個　兒。台南的高雄市，也以百分之二十五的比數，一九二人中裁去了四八人，其他各機關也都花作裁員的打算。</p>
<p>臺灣的失業狂潮，是促成動亂的主因，被裁汰的人員，他們將在失業羣中起着莫大的作用，而能得一職者，却又在吃不飽餓得死的窘境里偸度歲月。據說，公署從七月份起又要加薪了，將原有的三十三倍增到五十五倍，但人們對於加薪並不興奮，原因是加薪就是欠薪的前奏。</p>
<p>一個權威的學者告訴記者說：「以前從沒聽到衙門和敎育機關欠餉，但現在却不算希奇了！」</p>
<p>罷課·罷業·罷市</p>
<p>因爲當局的不能如期發薪，常構成學校罷課，罷敎的主因。這幾月來，從臺大醫院罷課開始起，到現在止，差不多有二十次以上的學校鬥風潮而罷課罷敎，台北，新竹，台中，臺南，高雄，都有，而基隆區七堵鄉公所全體職負因爲三個月沒有拿到一個錢，也開始前所未有的公務員罷業了。</p>
<p>構成罷課罷敎的其次的原因，常就是內地人和本省人之間的不能協調。敎育界的情形現在很淸楚的是在某些市區，由本省人包辦了，包辦不一定是壞，但包而不辦或辦而不包，就不成了。台北市敎育局長美崎，他就是有權而不能安挿人的一個，結果使他不能不灰心表示倦勤了，目前一般學校的風紀巳大不如前，學生們能刻苦耐勞，肯用功學習，可是易受煽動，他們之中甚至以爲上課與否，這是自由，民主·民主的曲解，也是司空見慣的事了，</p>
<p>最近新竹市十餘家酒館因抗捐而罷市，已經僵持了多天，我想，要是生活不能安定，物價　緻上漲，罷工的浪潮只會澎湃·汹湧，而本省人和外省人的距離，將愈離愈遠，這是　憂，也是難題。</p>

<p>距離台灣一千八百公里的西沙羣島，過去原係中國領土，法領安南後，又把她劃入法國的版圖，中國和法國，都只在地圖上劃劃而已，日本人却不然，他却在小島上面開始建着氣象台，法國曾提過抗戰，日本不理，也就算了。西沙羣烏在臺灣的領轄之下，本省氣象局長石延漢便於去年十二月十二日派員開着小船去接收，烏上沒有一個人，不但沒有活人，就是屍體也沒有，氣象局當然也不會有人，但氣象器材却完整無缺。因爲交涉沒有對象，沒奈何，只好在風力塔前立碑爲記，題曰：「台灣省行政長官公署接收完了」，氣象局本來去接收西沙氣象台的，結果却代表了長官公署接收了西沙羣島的領土主權。據石局長說：「當氣象局員在這荒僻的島上昇起第一面靑天白日滿地紅的國旗時，沒有樂隊，沒有民衆，看見國旗寂寞地徐徐上昇，眞有無限的感觸，我們就是那麼的替中華民國取得了一塊新領土」。</p>
<p>讀者怕和記者一樣，在看到接收完了的木牌照片時一定有着同樣的感觸，亦許你以爲這像是傳奇似的神話罷，但不是的，這是萬分確切的接收國土的史料，石局長最近才向記者宣佈的。</p>

<p>兩天車中，至感困頓，在二十二日午間，安抵馬德拉斯Madras，此爲英領印度三大管區之一，離加爾谷答約一千一百英里，假若以吾國里程計算，差不多自廣州至北平矣。馬城雖不及加爾各答熱鬧與繁華，但市街淸潔，建築整然，頗具現代都市風光。余由馬城中央車站下車後，即偕印友信哈乞叙及格斯沙彌三人，將行李由人力車運至伊格摩車站待車室，遂走訪當地僑領鮑李諸光生，　聖哲阿羅頻多居於法領邦　生Pondicherry，火車至該地，須在晚間開行，故利用白天半日時光以訪友兼視馬城風物。當地華僑有一百多人，以魯藉僑胞居多，鄂粵兩省次之，彼輩多開設餐館，鞋舖及鑲牙爲業，皆能刻苦奮鬥，對於社會公益事業，頗具熱情，且甚得當地英印人士之愛護：去年前保總領事君建（現任駐秘魯大使）視察來此，曾囑其成立華僑聯合會，用資團結，而固情誼，一載以來在鮑賢儀，李如杰，孫慶田諸君努力之下，頗具成績，出錢救國，更不後人。彼輩聞余，皆來相問訊，祖國烽火漫天，吾國今能在佛國相聚，亦人生之樂事也。迄晚七時，車由馬德拉斯向維拉坡開駛，乘客·爲擁擠，彼輩或赴錫蘭，或去屈勞科土邦，車中尚有一售布商人，出身於馬德拉斯大學，與余相談，欣欣以印度保持固有文化爲榮，余亦答之中國亦保持其四千年來之民族文化不過衣食住行方面，係西洋之文明，文化與文明係兩事，汝不能見余穿西服，即目爲西洋文化，此則大說矣，彼亦曰諾，夜十一時車抵維拉坡車站，余下車赴待事室，迄明晨五時，始搭專車赴法領邦迪迦里，晨七時即達目的地，旋有一印的度學生前來相詢，周君祥光來此乎，余答曰周君即余也。此生名阿育王，爲印友梅屈拉敎授　米相迎接者，乃同車赴阿須　，（義爲宗敎研究院）途中即遇梅敎授，略事寒暄畢幷詢及譚雲山先生好否，蓋渠二人昔日同參阿氏者也；余則赴古而岡大厦休息，此屋計四層，具長方形，爲日本某名工程師設計，每層約二十餘間，每人各住一間，至爲舒適。管理此屋者，爲英人梅農女士，見余，甚欣喜，吾輩居此，祗有靜的感覺，而無亂的心情；此屋建築費款達印幣十多萬，爲海特拉巴土邦王帝所捐贈，聖哲阿羅頻多設有阿須籃一所，以爲傳道之地，房屋百餘幢，位邦城之東，臨孟加拉灣，風景清幽，宜於修真，阿氏今年七十四歲矣，鶴髪童顏，道貌盎然，望之令人肅然起敬。</p>
<p>（二）聖母慈光</p>
<p>阿氏幼時，畢業於英劍橋大學，通拉丁，希臘，德，意，各國文字，對於梵文巴利文尤屬專精，曾任布洛特土邦及孟加拉省公立學院院長，嗣因鼓吹印度獨立，參加實際政治活動，組織國家主義黨，自任領袖，及其胞弟粗織革命團體，犯有嫌疑，被捕入獄，終以證據不全囚禁年餘，始獲自由，阿氏即於獄中，專事瑜　，而得證道，後遂飛錫，邦迪　　，繼續　　　發刋、「梵」雜誌，以其悟證所得，昭告世人，並揭生命神聖之理，欲期衆生同登彼岸。三十五年來如一日，精進之勤，殆可想見。阿氏於一九三〇年起，即默然無語，不與任何人接談，但與聖母梅拉氏論道，則屬例外，聖母梅拉氏爲法人。今年六十四歲矣，幼時，具修眞之願，及長遂以訪道爲事，足跡遍世界各國，迄一九二〇年，她由日本來印，遇阿氏於邦迪迦里，被此相談，契然有悟，遂與阿氏共同致力生命神聖事業，所謂生命神聖云云，要使人類由凡轉聖，並協同阿氏主編「梵」雜誌，今日阿氏弟子呼之爲聖母，但對阿氏則稱師尊焉，聖母每日早晨，必在庭園散步，斯時衆弟子皆鵠立於旁，合十致敬，聖母微笑相答，備見慈祥。晚間例有參禪一課，院中弟子羣坐於捨生樹下，收斂心神，期與太虛同一，捨生花香，微風拂面，此時此景，眞有如阿彌陀經上所云之七　莊嚴極樂國也，靜坐一小時後，益覺身心舒暢，吾人能破除我執，達無我之境，則此眞我，即是上帝，道非遠人。其人自遠：斯時，吾輩復一一參見聖母，蓋此夕爲聖母來此修眞二十五週年紀念，院中小徑，遍插鮮花，余頂禮時，聖母微笑，慈祥之意露於面上，並賜鮮花一朵，留爲誌念，此花淸淨，此花神聖，吾輩娑婆世界，皆染汚泥，不能與天心相近，祇有苦無樂，有煩惱而無淸淨，見花思維，彌增感慨！余將此花，置於案頭，虔誠致敬，敬花即敬天心也。</p>
<p>（三）剎因緣</p>
<p>二十四日晨，阿氏以其主要著作，生命神聖（歐人視爲二十世紀之哲學鉅著）梵經論評，依修奧義書及瑜珈基礎等十多種，親筆簽名見贈，聖母亦然，彼老二人，要以其近影，簽贈余，余也不敏，得此殊遇，來日唯有遵二老訓，爲人類生命神聖事業，盡一分力，以圖報耳。下午二時，爲我輩在家弟子，向阿氏頂禮朝見之辰，速同修道院弟子在內，約四百人，來自南北各地者亦約百人，其中十九爲大學名敎授，英法人士亦多，斯時阿氏與聖母共坐於一室，阿氏居右，聖母居左，吾輩各持鮮花一束供獻，余向二老頂花時不覺精神充實，雜念俱消，阿氏衣白色印度常服，二臂袒露，鬚髮現金黃色，精神矍爍，道貌岸然，身體魁梧健壯，聖母則衣印度沙麗，二老見余輩，倶微笑相答，此一刹那，即余與阿羅頻多氏因緣所自也。</p>
<p>（四）邦城小駐</p>
<p>事後聖母The　Mother曾詢阿氏曰：汝見中國靑年周君來此訪問乎？阿氏曰，余知之見之矣。印人聞之，益爲敬慕，蓋每年請求參訪者，不下萬人，能邀准者，數百人而已，而得阿氏頷可者，則更鮮矣。昔日美國威爾遜總統之女公子亦來參訪，小住而去，余在阿氏阿須籃中，時達半月，每日除看書外，則與阿氏諸大弟子，如N．K．GupatPavitalaS．K．Mlilra　Nirada　Ray　Purani等研討生命神聖哲學問題，余並先以吾國宋明理學問題，闡明印度哲學能與瑜珈悟證相合，先明眞理，而通常理，中國哲學則從事理中去體騐眞理。方法雖屬有異，究竟目的則同，佛言宇宙眞理祇一，衆生所見不同耳。阿氏所創生命神聖學說，爲現代唯心學派中之一大學派印人視爲二千年前大聖人再生，印度文藝復興之靈魂，昔日詩翁太戈爾先生往訪阿氏後而作詩曰：阿羅頻多，其受余之頂禮膜拜乎！今日見汝皆智慧，他日再見，則余無言歌誦矣！其受余之頂禮膜拜乎？法國文豪嚴曼羅蘭亦曰：阿羅頻多集歐亞哲學文化於一身，而調和之，其敬佩之情，於斯可知。</p>
<p>阿須籃中設有圖書館，銀行，工廠，醫院，並附設小學一所，學生百餘人，皆院中修　士之子弟，以習英法印文爲主，其他科學次之，圖書館中藏書達數十萬卷，以英法印文爲多，並出有「降生」季刋一種，爲衆弟子寫作園地。那迪迦里爲法領印度首都，設有總督府，高等法院，法國巴黎大學在此亦設有文理學院，余曾往文理學院參觀，院中學生約數百人，講授一律用法文，法學院則附設於高等法院內，另有醫學院一所，因余不諳　學，故未前去參觀，當地印人都能講法語，不諳英語，所有商店招牌：十之八九都用法文及塔米爾文二者並寫，余曾與文理學院註册主任相談，倘若中華學校畢業學生可否逕入學院，彼答曰如知法文則可，否則須補習一年方可。余在邦城小住，頗覺舒適，終因校中事務太忙，不能久留，乃於五月五日搭車返馬特拉斯，是夜離邦城前，余向聖母告辭並述明余來日對生命神聖事業之志願興精進計畫，備蒙一一指示予以許可。院中各友好皆送余至車站，車於九時開行，明晨七時即安抵馬特拉斯矣。翌日印友Seth　saman前來，陪余至馬特拉斯大學參觀，馬大位在海濱，風景淸幽，校舍數十幢，其中省立學院，規模最大，適値學校放暑假，未能詳細參觀，僅在圖書館流覽一遍，該館藏書達數百萬卷，關於印度哲學書籍，即有十餘萬卷，惟有關於吾國哲學者，則祗有一本老子道德經（英譯本）外人欲研究中國文化，因語言文字所障，吾國學人通中國文史而又兼通外國文者甚鮮，以致不能將吾文化移植國外，殊可痛惜，關遇奈格坡大學哥斯伯敎授於旅邸，彼此討論瑜珈哲學問題頗爲相得，遂搭車同赴鐵路梵那馬里亞城　那摩禪師。</p>
<p>（五）謁見禪師</p>
<p>晚七時車由馬城動身，翌晟抵鐵城，該地多山，氣候最熱，午後不能出門庭一步，困坐室中，入晚始覺涼快，余抵鐵城後，與哥斯伯敎授同住於萊易博士D．Roy家中，萊易博士爲馬特拉斯大學名敎授，近因年老退休鄕間，從那摩禪師專事書尼瑜珈（中國所謂　學）之術，余謁那　禪師時，乃以鮮花水菓敬獻，渠見余至，微笑點頭相答，並囑余席地而坐，禪師坐於床上，默然入定，那摩禪師自己設有阿須籃一所，於阿山之麓，在院修道者，亦近百人，渠與衆弟子日夕共坐一室，聚餐一室，身上祇穿一條短褲，携一杖，餘無他物，渠與弟子也不以口頭文字相傳，乃以心心相印，或有人問之，如何開始參禪？渠即曰，誰是你？其言外之意，吾人今日之身，皆非眞我，乃一假我，如能覓得眞我，則此眞我即是上帝，與宇宙同大，與天地合一，故那摩禪師之敎實係達摩祖師一派眞傳，其來中國者，形成了敎外別傳之禪宗，如要覓得眞我，必須破除我執，達無我之境，不染一物於心中，古佛所謂「雁飛斜過潭含影，影減依然澈底淸」之境界，然後見任何一物，皆具生意，見天地之心，「溪身遍是廣長舌，山色無非淸净身」，杜甫所謂「等閒識得東風面，萬紫千紅總是春」亦見天心之意也。那摩禪師今年六十四歲矣，鬚髮已白，彼於十六歲時出家，其時彼正在馬特拉斯大學參加甄錄試，忽然證道，乃棄家坐於山洞中達十八年，其後功行圓滿，始下山授道諸弟子，設阿須籃於鐵城，今日印人咸稱爲大聖人Maha　Rishi，余在印印有那摩禪師及阿羅頻多肖像，足見印人敬慕之情。余住於那摩禪師阿須籃中計四日，日夕與禪師共坐一室，雖證悟未能，亦略知文字般若耳。關於那摩禪師及聖哲阿羅頻多氏顯聖之事跡殊多，常人聞之，恐不合科學之譏，姑不敍述。</p>
<p>余於五月十五日返馬特拉斯，備承當地僑胞熱烈招待，私衷感激，十九日安返加城。綜計此次遊訪南印，征程萬里，時歷一月，先後參訪印度當代兩大哲人，使余人安心立命之學，益具信心，服務人類之願更形堅定，余返加後，曾召集中華學校全體同仁學生作此次遊訪演講並結論曰：</p>
<p>（一）人類由凡轉聖並非不可能，且有方法可行，須視吾人心智堅毅與否而定。</p>
<p>（二）國家强盛與否，須視其民族心思才力所集注者爲何？</p>
<p>（三）吾人必須發大願起大悲，爲世界人類和平前途努力。</p>
<p>憶余幼時，誦新會梁先生三十自壽詩有「世界無窮願無盡，海天遼廓立多時」句，雄心飛騰，不可遏止，茲願以此語與學人共度臀肆中，見每一梵文經典，都勉之。</p>
<h3 id="c132">湖南茶桐　一落千丈 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 本報廿日長沙航訊　特派員　高元禮寄</p>
<p>中國是農業國家，湖南更可說是農業社會的代表，穀米雜糧固然是湖南的主要出產，但它的副產茶葉和桐油，在全省農村裏，確也佔最重要的地位，農村的繁榮，固然要穀米雜糧豐收，可是茶葉和桐油的銷路遲滯，亦足以促成湖南農村的凋敝。</p>
<p>茶區　六十四縣</p>
<p>八年來的湖南農業，雖差强人意，除去年外，年年豐收，但敵人的封鎖政策，受影響最大的莫過於湖南，使她的茶葉和桐油無法出口，直接减低農村的收八，近半年狂虐的災荒，表面上是饑饉，骨子裏與這不無關係·</p>
<p>湖南產茶地區，在全省七十六縣中，佔六十四縣，臨湘·安化·平江·　陽·湘陰·桃源·新化·郴縣·岳陽·長沙·石門·慈利·湘鄕·沅陵·　陵·邵陽·武岡等十七縣，產量最多，也最有名，總產量佔全國第三位·品質方面則以安化之紅茶，磚茶·臨湘之黑磚茶爲最者名，銷塲遍及國內外，而磚茶尤爲蘇聯所必　，年來因戰事期間交通阻塞，銷路極爲不振。</p>
<p>上述諸種產品中最値得注意的是安化茶葉，安化位資水流域中部，全縣境內到處均適宜種茶，即安化以外資水流械所經各地均有生產，農民賴此爲生者，數百萬人之多，安化則爲主要產地亦爲集散地，茶分五種，一爲黑茶，又名引茶係左宗棠平定新省時奏請倣照鹽引辦法，招商承辦，歸官銷售，運往西北，謂之引茶，二爲紅茶，即國際市塲上所稱之湘紅，三爲綠茶，四爲磚茶，以上四種，除一部綠茶爲湘省本地所用外，其餘幾全部外銷，據統計光緒廿七年至民國四年間紅茶一項年產四萬箱平均年產六萬箱，但其品質不及祁紅，難與皖茶競爭，遂致一落千丈，民國三十二年以後年產二千箱而已·</p>
<p>黑茶　西北必需</p>
<p>黑茶爲西北各地人士所必需，如吾人之於鹽，爲不可或缺之食用品，故其銷行極旺，興盛之年，可產兩千引，約十二萬餘担，常年亦產一千二百引，合七萬餘担，民國卅年僅產一萬七千四百担，本十一年雖增二萬三千八百五十一担，全數爲中茶公司所收購，三十二年以後，因交通關係，黑茶無人收購，其產量更少，而安化存貨尚有一百噸未曾運出，至已運至漢口，益陽·鄭州各地者，亦有三百餘噸尚未售出，致製茶商多不敢再行製造。</p>
<p>磚茶　便利運輸</p>
<p>磚茶爲近年所發明，其本身即爲黑茶，爲便於運輸而壓製爲磚者，其主要主顧爲蘇聯，中蘇易貨協定成立，茶業復蘇，當時武漢成爲湘茶轉運的重要商埠，茶葉由政府統購統銷，以謀爭取外　，於是中央信託局易貨處湖南磚茶廠應運而生，該廠即由湖南建設　之茶業管理處脫胎而來，三十年改名省磚茶廠，三十一年與中茶公司合營，改稱中茶公司湖南磚茶廠，中茶公司移併復與公司後即未復工，另一製茶廠，即爲湖南省製茶廠，係由農業改進所安化茶塲改組而成的，這兩廠馬於官營，至於民營茶廠散佈於安化縣屬之東坪黃沙坪等地，較著名者有新　公司安化製茶廠，兩　　茶廠，及華安公司等，均製紅綠茶，並利用小型木製壓磚機壓製一斤重之磚茶，惟資力均不若官營製茶廠雄厚，以致生產不多。</p>
<p>茶農　生活堪虞</p>
<p>安化茶區的情形，大概如此，而茶農的情形如何呢，說起來更不堪設想，茶農對他的茶林，和逐四同等重視，在未施行統購統銷政策以前，茶農採採茶入市，隨時出售，完全自由買賣，尚不感受若何痛苦，然而自統購統銷政策實行後，茶價旣已規定，但茶澳並不能直接與中茶公司交易，而必經中間人介紹，成由中間人轉手，於是茶農所得，每不足其肥料人工之所費，及後銷路斷絕，無人購買，更苦不堪言，安化附近產區茶樹，每爲茶農欲作薪炭，今年因戰事結束，茶業本可望復蘇，但又受外匯限制，出口無望，仍無法振興。</p>
<p>政府對茶業無通盤救濟辦法，亦促成茶業的衰落，建設廳雖已請准茶貸一億元，但祇是供遝銷安化存茶之用，於茶農並無多大益處，據湖南磚茶廠廠長彭先澤先生說：湖南茶葉本身確係上品，然而因製法不良，以致無法爭取國際市塲，殊爲可惜，若能由政府大量貸款救濟，獎勵出口，雖不能取錫蘭茶地位而代之，亦可在國際茶葉市塲佔一席地，而茶農以茶葉能大量出口，必能因而間接沾惠也。</p>
<p>桐油　產量減少</p>
<p>桐油是中國的特產，也是湖南的特產，據海關貿易册所載，自光緒三十二年起，至民國三十年止，湖南桐油出口數量由二百二十七担增至六十萬担，但以三十年的六十萬担和民國十八年的五十三萬三千担比較，實際上產量並未增加，反而减少。</p>
<p>產量减少的原因，並不是政府不提倡獎勵，事實上政府在　植方面，相當的有成續，廿五年春，政府在零陵·南岳·岳陽·等處，設立四個紀念林，又令省公路局於公路兩旁種植桐樹，並訂定湖南省鄕鎭保甲植桐計劃大樹，利用合作辦法，每鄕予種子　二千元庄省銀行　付，預定二十九年植桐三千株以後每年增植一千至二千株，由此可見湖南推廣植桐的積　。</p>
<p>桐林　分佈情形</p>
<p>湖南桐林的分佈主要是在湘西，其次是湘南，湘西各地沿沅水流域所產桐油佔全省百分之六十，沅陵一縣即年產五萬担，總計沅水各縣年產三十七萬担以上，湘水流域年產爲全省百分之十六，總計年產約十萬担，資水灃水每年亦有少數生產，大多爲三年桐。</p>
<p>在民國二十五年八月間，政府爲爭取國外市塲，在桐油的壓榨方面，曾着手改進，在各地設立植物油廠，改進品質，曾獲得極大的效果，而湖南的桐油出口量亦日有增加，於是桐業欣欣向榮，然而　景不常，二十六年戰事爆發，出口無路，乃由財部復興公司負統購統銷之責，及至滇緬路斷絕，復興公司亦停止收購，桐油遂由外銷變爲內銷，國內除用以點燈外，曾以之提煉汽油，然因成本過高，亦無法發展·</p>
<p>外銷　並未絕望</p>
<p>戰事結束後，夢想的桐油外銷，仍無法實現，留滯於產區的桐油山積，桐農一方面因無銷路，一方面又以災荒嚴重，放棄收穫，任其腐壞者極多。以至湘西產量幾已降至往年之一半。</p>
<p>但是桐油的外銷是否有望呢？美國的代用品是否已將桐油的地位取而代之呢，答案是：還有希望，據商務日報所載「戰後桐油消費統制取消後，美國最大銷費量每年仍可達一億磅，故美國仍不失爲我國桐油之市塲·」</p>
<p>桐樹　危機潛伏</p>
<p>然而，儘管外國的銷塲大，而政府不加扶持，終是無法出口的，成本旣高，而運費又大，長沙油價每担四萬元，由長沙運至上海，每担運費三萬元，再由滬運至美國，運費及進口稅，每祖成本已超過八萬元，而美國市價每磅三角五分美金，七萬元國幣一担，是商人運至美國銷售，每担須貼本一萬元左右，毫無利益，商人均裹足不前，此項差額，政府迄無貼補之策，欲求大量出口，如何能够，而受影響最重的，還是桐農，有人說若長此下去，幾年後，桐樹在中國將會絕跡，言雖有些誇大，但可想見其危機之大。</p>
<p>在湖南的植物油廠正計劃改進桐油的品質和桐油的利用，已在美訂購大批榨油機，目前常德廠每月可榨油二十噸，他們希望能够運用製造油漆·肥皂·來利用一部份桐油，但是仍然是治標的辦法，若不求其治本，危機仍然會存在的。</p>

<h3 id="c133">松江讀者緊急報吿　霍亂盛行死亡激增 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>提急救問題由　本顧問迅速解答</p>
<p>編者先生：敬啓者，敝鎭自上月流行眞性霍亂以來，蔓延地區逐漸擴大，患者雖經西醫治療及早注射適量鹽水及强心針，內服止嘔瀉藥及吸收等對症療法，而治愈者實屬寥寥，大多數病者注射鹽水後體溫漸恢復，脈漸博起，經二三小時後，旋起反復，而入於不可挽救，死亡率之大，足以驚人！約在百分之八十以上，閱報悉滬上虎疫死亡率只在百分之二十以下，相差竟如此之大，現的鄉人對於西醫已失却信仰，而中醫更無對策，如發現此病後，只聽天由命，束手待斃而已，豈不慘哉！鄙人爲惻隱之心所驅使，特錄問題數條，敬懇先生撥冗向滬地醫院或專科醫師處探詢治療虎疫經過及用藥等詳情，刋於報端，俾使各流行地區醫師參考採納，挽救沉淪，减少死亡率，實功德無量也。</p>
<p>茲將問題列後，請分條答覆：</p>
<p>（一）治標方面：對於吐瀉之有効處置？（吐實可惡，甚至藥劑一入即吐，不能發生藥効，有無特效針藥注射後即可止吐，然後進藥。瀉亦可怕，二三次大瀉後，即呈脫水症狀，一般炭素等吸收劑毫無效用，請將有效止瀉處方公佈，以便醫師採用·）</p>
<p>（二）治本方面：殺菌劑比較何種爲有效？滬上採用何種？</p>
<p>（三）注射血漿：或血蛋白，是否較鹽水爲有效，應注射多少？每五百西西，需價若干？</p>
<p>（四）霍亂酸中毒，應如何處置？</p>
<p>（五）霍亂患者總兼尿閉，應用何種利尿藥爲適當？</p>
<p>鵠候公布或賜覆，專此敬頌公綏松江松隱陸希白敬啓醫學博士唐仁縉答</p>
<p>上海霍亂病人死亡率較少之</p>
<p>原因如下：</p>
<p>（一）病者發現後，即送時疫　院，加以緊急治療。（二）全市設有時疫隔離醫院較多，且有　家日夜主持，即藥品器械等亦極充足。（三）交通工具便利。鄕間缺乏時疫醫院，或有之，亦設備簡陋，病人缺乏醫藥常職，發現霍亂後，每先挑痧，服丹方及求神問卜等，以致延說時間，失却治療機會。茲將所問五則，奉答於后：</p>
<p>（一）對於吐瀉，普通注射嗎啡，或內服阿片酊，及口含欲塊。（二）可內服Sulfa－Guanidine。（三）注射血漿，上海所用多爲美國出品（原名Human　Plasma）。每瓶五百西西，價約美金三十元，合國幣七，八萬元左右。（四）酸中毒係吐瀉後，體內缺乏水份之故，爲預防計，常先行注射鹼性兼含葡萄糖之液體，（市上發售者爲Lockes　sol）後再注射生理鹽水，或Pinger’s　sol如此旣可迅速奏效，又可避免酸中毒。（五）尿閉對於本病之預後，關係甚大，是以在治撩上，利尿與强心元重要性，不亞於鹽水注射，據Rumqe氏之報告，凡完全無尿者，其死亡率爲百分之五七·二。無尿閉症者，僅爲百分之四·七，普通利尿强心劑，如Caffein，S．B，Digalin，sol，Camphor，Hexeton，Aoramin，Diuretin，Urotropin，Strophautin等內服或注射，</p>
<p>本人意見：</p>
<p>（一）應普遍强制注射霍亂防疫針，（二）霍亂弧萬，大槪存在病人之糞便及吐物中，其傳染之主要媒介物，爲水，因病人之排泄物，混雜於水中，如井水，河水，貴處無自來水，若病人之衣服及附有排泄物之雜物，均在河中井邊洗滌，甚至淘米洗菜，均在一處，極易傳染，同時蒼蠅亦爲主要媒介，所以地方有識人士，務須勸導民衆，注意以上各點，以防患未然。如撲蠅方法，可用DDT噴射，飲料宜加煮沸，勿吃生冷瓜菓，及被蒼蠅停留過之食物。生水中可加漂白粉及石灰。（三）病人之排泄物須加以濃厚石灰消毒，至衣服用具等，亦應加以煮沸消毒。</p>

<p>— 君默節譯</p>
<p>戰後第一次的和平會議，已經在巴黎揭幕了。戰爭結束以來，世界始終是在劍拔駑張的氣氛下惴慄。人類是不是還會走向一次更恐怖的戰爭？人類的智慧能不能贏起明日的和平與文明？英國名歷史學家，牛津大學國際關係敎授魏華特以爲，世界文明的命運，就縏於我們今日的如何應付以下的七重難關上。</p>
<p>戰爭已經過去了，但我們實在很難說是不是眞的已經勝利，因爲我們現在還並未曾脫離勝利後的危險期。明日世界的和平與文化能不能够保持，還要看我們今日能不能够解決那與它最有關係的七種主要因素：</p>
<p>（一）飢荒，物質和心理生活的騷亂</p>
<p>第一個問題，也可以說是第一組問題，就是戰爭結束以後所遺留下來的，物質和心理上的滿目瘡痍。飢荒已經遍及世界，而一個肌餓的世界是無法能維持一種和平的秩序的。不單如此，由於機械的缺乏，生產力大大降低；由於房屋的缺乏，健全的家庭生活的基礎遭受了損害；而物質生活的低降也必然地引向了心靈生活的低降。在戰爭中，訓練的只是破壞和屠殺，我們應如何來把這種違反文明的人生標準引回到人與人間親切相愛的道德標準，這是一件十分重要的事情。</p>
<p>（二）德國問題</p>
<p>此事進退兩難。如果我們永遠用强力壓着他們，那末，六百萬有着高度文明的人民，長久過着半原始的，非工業化的生活，這將使歐洲永遠留於貧困。而且有着這樣的一個因素存在，也決難能建立起一個健全的，安定的歐洲。但如果我們帮助德國復興呢，那說不定它又會翻起身來，想再來一次武力征服歐洲。德國人的思想並未曾如我們所希望地改變。歷史告訴我們，愈到近代，一個失敗國家的翻身愈快。這需要我們十分謹愼的處置。</p>
<p>（三）斯拉夫民族之再起</p>
<p>戰後歐洲的一個顯著特微，就是斯拉夫民族之再起。這件事實的重要，不亞於十六七世紀海權國家的讓位於十八世紀的殖民國家，以及後來十九世紀的工業國家。歐洲斯拉夫民族的再起，意思當然並不是說，將使英國與蘇聯發生任何嚴重深切的衝突。就資源上而諭，蘇聯應該不致再望在歐洲擴展，但目前，有兩處確乎已可能引起問題，一是在希臘，一是在挪威，而挪威問題或更重要，尤其是對美國而言。</p>
<p>（四）新的世界戰略</p>
<p>新的戰爭方法已帶給了這戰後世界一種新的政治情勢。地中海已失去了遠東航行的重要性，這就是說，僅僅海上的霸權已無所用。直布羅陀的防衛今日已甚少價値，而馬爾他也不再有多少用了。目前，對於歐洲，東非的海港和基地倒已遠較蘇彝士運河更爲重要。因爲了這種關係，英國對意大利殖民地索馬利闌的將來，也就更爲關心了。</p>
<p>北極圈的交通，也是戰後各國所集中注意的問題之一。阿拉斯加和卡察加半烏已成了戰略的要地，因爲就州與州間的距離論，經由北極的交通比較經由南極要近得多。</p>
<p>（五）原子彈</p>
<p>原子彈改變了整個世界的戰略地理，也威脅着整個人類的文明。但這還不單是一個生命損失的問題，因爲十四世紀時的黑死病曾毀滅了西歐整個人口的三分之一，也並未見得就遏止了歐洲以後的文明。但原子彈是不同的。它的破壞影響主要的是人類秩序生活的長久未能恢復，因此文明長久地停留在難於前進的靜止點上。我們必須了解，目前人口最集中，工業最集中，因而最易遭受原子彈毀減的城市，也正是領導着今日世界的文明的。</p>
<p>（六）思想的衝突</p>
<p>每次大戰的結果，都使我們感覺是一種政治制度的失敗，和另一種政治制度的勝利。這次的戰爭，很淸楚的，是德意獨裁政治的失敗，和西方民主自由政治的勝利·但說至此，我們都不免要感覺一種矛盾：蘇聯是一個完全極擭制度的細家，換句話說，乃是另一積的獨戲，而目前，在默洲的大片土地上，政治的自由氣氛已經消失，而一黨獨裁的政治又在抬頭。一方面是馬克思主羲的極權思想，另一方面是中產階級的自由思想，這兩種潮流，形成了今日世界心理上的一種最主要的衝突。</p>
<p>（七）需夢改變</p>
<p>要阻止這種極權趨勢的蔓延不是一件很容易的事情，因爲世界上的人民都需要着一種社會和經濟秩序上的澈底改變，這乃是不可否認的事實。很久來，我們的文化都不過是建立在貧困和不均之上的，但目前，由於人類對於自然資源的控制，這一種時代應該可以過去了。我們目前的問題，只是在如何把人類道種對於自然的控制引向一種正確的目標去。</p>
<p>維護使節和平的機構一聯合國辦公處</p>
<h3 id="c136">美自由主義派　積極主張對蘇友好　家南譯自美國生活雜誌 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>美國的戰後外交政策，關係重大，已經成爲全世界注意的目標。美國國內對於這個重大問題，意見也很不一致。杜魯門貝爾納斯一派和華萊士一派的主張，就有很大的出入，甚至有極深刻的衝突存在其間。這種衝突的後果究竟嚴重到什麼程度，我們可以從下面的事實中看出來。</p>
<p>早在戰爭結束之前，美國的軍事當局認爲在道個新武器層見疊出的時代，美國必須保留大西洋中外圍的根據地，直至世界機構力能維持持久和平時爲止。在這些根據地中，最需要的當推冰島。所以在去年十月，我們就向冰島政府要求租借戰時基地九十九年，同時保證在聯合國能够成立完善的安全機構之後，就把基地移交聯介國管理。冰島人是一個高傲而獨立的民族，美國駐冰島公使特雷佛斯努力折衝，保證上述租借建議決不致影饗冰島的主權，並且爲了表示友好起見，決意帮助冰島加入聯合國爲會員。到了今年三月，成立協定已經極有希望了。</p>
<p>就在三月下句，商務部長華萊士突然牽涉到道個塲面雖小關係却大的國際舞台裏來。他舉行了一次新聞會議，嚴厲指責美軍留駐冰島爲不當，並且堅決表示蘇聯必然會認定此舉有反蘇作用的。其後參議員丕潑又發表了一篇重要的演說，為華萊士聲援。四月中，「爭取和平會議」就在商務部的大禮堂中召開，重要自山主義者如參議員季爾哥和衆議員社格拉斯都出席參加，再度提出美國在海外設立根據地的計劃具有侵略和反蘇意味，大聲疾呼要求美軍自冰島撤退。事態的發展，使冰島政府不願再老慮在和平時期設立根據地的問題了。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯</p>
<h3 id="c137">華萊士一派　步伐凌亂 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>冰島人的態度可能會改變過來。但是假如他們堅決不移，而我國需要大西洋外圍根據地的日子竟然有一天來臨了，那麼華萊士，丕潑和他們的附和者是要抱憾的。我們從不懷疑華萊士動機的高尚，也不敢說在海外設立基地的計劃一定準確。但是有一點是値得注意的，就是這個計劃是美國政府共同擬定的政策，經過總統和各方面的顧問核准的。華萊士以不負資任的姿態千涉一椿極微妙而又極重要的事情，結果推翻了他自己所屬政府的政策。他常然有表示意見的權利，但是假如他在內閣會議中不能使同僚接受他的意見，那麼唯一的辦法就是辭職或者械口不言。華萊士沒有這樣做，反而採取了一種似乎越出常軌的方法。從這一點，就可以看出以華萊士一派代表的美國自由主義，步伐是如何混亂了。</p>
<p>這種混亂的原因究竟在那裏呢？說來很簡單，這就是自由主義派對蘇聯的態度。原來蘇聯在社會和經濟計劃方面的大規模試騐以及在抵抗德國中所表現的動人成就·已經深深地打動了自由主義派的想像。當戰爭結束的時候，美國自由主義者的頭腦中對於蘇聯已經構成一幅理想化的圖畫了。</p>
<p>所不幸者，蘇聯堅韌而出色的領袖並不是自由派的理想主義者而是現實主義者。他們和大多數的自由主義者不同，明瞭力量是一切政治的基本因素。在戰爭結束之後，他們就着手試騐一種擴張主義。這不得不叫我門驚疑蘇聯在未完全控制歐亞兩洲之前，是否會感到滿足。</p>
<h3 id="c138">蘇現實主義　不易挽回 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>但是自由主義者是不會這樣審判的。他們往往把蘇聯政策現實的一面和他們想像中，對於蘇聯所構成的理想圖畫混雜在一起。他們中間有些人以爲蘇聯的「現實政治」可以用誠愛的態度把它挽回過來；也有人以爲蘇聯的政策並不見得比舊式的英國國帝主義來得壞，彷彿媽媽原諒她們孩子的行爲一樣。我們聽到這種煞費苦心的辯解，內心是非常痛苦的，因爲在一九三七年，一九三八年和一九三九年，我們也聽見過類似的論調。事實上，假如一種政治運動不能適應時代的需要，那就有失却其力量的危險。我們當前最重大的需要，就是組織一個穩定繁榮與和平的世界，但是不願和不敢勇往直前去應付現實的人，就不能在這方面有所成就，這是美國自由主義的悲劇。</p>
<p>許多人往往喜歡猜想，假如今日羅斯福總統在世，他將採取怎樣的政策？事實上在這方面去多費功夫是沒有多大意義的，但是有一點非常明顯，就是羅斯福一方面努力和蘇聯推誠相見，而另一方面則保持美國堅定的立塲。我們可以說現在國務卿貝爾納斯爭取的政策，就頗有羅斯福的痕跡存在其間。美國目前在國際政治上所採取的路綫，有下面幾點：（一）全力支特聯合國機構，使它力能解決世界上各種問題；（二）將可怕的新武器置於聯合國管制之下，並且在聯合國的指導之下實行軍縮，（三）以更堅決的態度對付蘇聯，防止其不斷的擴張；（四）以最大努力在世界各地進行救濟復興工作，因爲　饉和貧困可以造成政治上的眞空，而誘使蘇聯從事新的冒險。但是値得說明的一點，就是這種思想的基本內容，並不是要和蘇聯作戰而是要去除戰爭的危險，改善世界的情形，而使美蘇兩國可以和平相處。蘇聯的領袖遭過了美國這種堅定的政策之後，會明白和美國爭雄競長是沒有意義的，然後專心致意於國內的發展，而與聯合各國平等相待。時間可以把猜疑和異見消除，終於獲得和平的美果。</p>

<h3 id="c139">印度獨立　第一重難關渡過 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 君默譯自合眾社特稿</p>
<p>在英國的引導和協助之下，印度正舉足走向獨立的第一步。印度人要使自己成爲眞正的主人，前面自然還有着重重障碍，需要克服，但第一默的難關，總算是已經過去了。英國派了一個內閣代表團到印度，帶着英政府所擬的方案，希望能使印度逐步走向獨立之途。經過和印度各政黨的幾度商討以後，這個方案總算已爲各主要政黨所接受了，主要的是國民大會黨，（代表印度敎徒）。回敎同盟，（代表回敎徒）和各王公。這個方案在性質上是一種溫和的變革，一切需要各黨派和各階級間的同意。七月間，各方都將推選代表，組織制憲議會。議會擬於八月一日召開，草定新憲法。新憲法草定以後，還須送到倫敦，由下議院通過。</p>
<p>這個新憲法必須要符合英國所擬獨立計劃的輸廓與原則，其中尤其須保障印度的少數民族，特別是九千六百萬的回敎徒。同時，憲法中亦必須規定，印度應與英國訂立一種條約。此外，憲法中並常規定組織聯邦，聯邦中央負責整個國家的外交，國防和交通，並有機徵稅以供上項行政之用。聯邦中央應有一執行機關來主持，並有一立法議會，代表目前的英屬印度和諸王公藩邦。凡是不屬於聯邦中央的權力，則仍都由各邦保留。</p>
<p>這個全印的聯邦中央，將代替英國而成爲印度事實上的最高權力。憲法一經通過，英國就將與印度訂立一種永久的國防協定，給予英國某種特殊的權利，保護印度並維護帝國的交通。印度人要擬定這麼一種憲法究竟需要多久，目前還無法估計。不過，這不是一件很容易的事情，由於種種的困難，說不定要幾個月甚至幾年以後才能够擬成。</p>

<p>今日的歐洲是疲倦，飢餓，滿目悽凉。過去數月來，我旅行全歐，所得到的印象是：歐洲的人民今日所需要的乃是糧食，衣着，房子，和從政治的緊張情緒下舒鬆下來。大部分的人因爲復員的緩慢而深感失望。他們渴望着戰前安居樂業的日子能早日到來。許多人希望着能有一段假期，可以到陽光明媚的地方鬆一口氣。也有的想讀一讀多年來所不能看到了的書籍，雜誌和報紙。千百萬的人回到了宗敎的懷抱。宗敎的刋物銷數都超過了戰前的三四倍，敎堂裏信徒們人山人海，即使在德國和蘇聯，也是如此。尋求消遣和娛樂的情緒，異常高漲。戲院和遊娛塲所的熱鬧，打破了以往任何時候的記錄。電影院裏塲塲擠得水洩不通。倫敦和許多歐洲國家的戲院常常要兩三個月前就先去定座位。任何一個平庸的戲都可以演很長一個時期，保證會客滿。大家都引頸渴望着美國的新片子到。有許多國家還在演好萊塢五年甚至十年以前的老片子。人民到處在設法逃避現實。歐洲人今日從不想什麼外交之類的事情，世界的强權政治已使大部分的人們心灰意泛了。他們情願先想想自己的肚皮，脚上的鞋子，和一家人張口要吃的麵包，肉和洋蕃薯了。</p>
<p>搭火車汽車都要排很長的隊，工人和公務員都抱怨，一切都仍在定量配給，而且，有些日用品甚至比戰時還要缺乏了。</p>
<p>幸好，除了荷蘭，法國，比利時，芬蘭，挪威等國之外，歐洲大體地還不曾有全面的飢荒。但六年的戰亂，已影響了人整個的生活。肺病多得可驚，孩子們尤其是疾病叢生，死亡率已經在激劇地上漲。</p>
<p>一年前大家曾害怕會有瘟疫，會有內戰的流血，會有普遍的大罷工。但現在看來，這些大槪是可以倖免的了。整個地看起來，歐洲的情形比起以前一般人所預料的也許要略略好一點。</p>

<p>比基尼第一次原子彈試騐以後，許多人們都頗感失望，覺得原子彈的威力似乎遠不似想像中的偉大，因爲船艦旣多數未沉，供試騐用的動物也很多活着。他們原希望一彈爆發，就會弄成「一片白茫茫大地眞乾净」。事實上，對於這次的試騐，正確的估價應該如何？下面是美國新聞週刋的專欄評論家林德萊氏親自視察後的平允之諭。</p>
<p>對於這次原子彈試騐結果的看法，須視三件事情而定：一，你事先的希望至何程度；二，你對於艦船及動物損失的視察，仔細至何程度；三，輻射能的影饗目前你眞正知道的有多少。</p>
<p>目前許多關於損失的報告，都只是爆炸後不久在遠距離或者空中視察所得的，對於幅射能及實際的損書方面，他們還並未十分淸楚。在空中只見尼伐達號仍浮在水面，附近的棕櫚樹以及艦上的動物有許多都仍安然無恙，這一切初看不免失望，就是我自己，爆炸後飛到上空視察，看見這個情形時，心中也曾不免感覺失望，但當飛機飛得較低，能淸楚看見被炸得歪斜不堪的鐵板和桅桿砲身時，你對於原子彈的信心就可恢復不少。到你離開飛機，改坐一條小艇登艦仔細視察時，你對原子彈的尊敬就更加强了。</p>
<p>凡此種種，還只不過是一眼可見的損害，幅射能的影響尚未計及在內。道些，我們必須待專家們研究受損的船艦和動物以後，方能判明。動物或者人體內部受到幅射能的影響以後發生的結果如何？幅射能對於艦身的穿透性至何程度，對於船員的影響如何？因爲如果船員受傷或死亡，艦隊即使未沉，也就沒有用了。</p>
<p>這種種都考慮過以後，我們還應記得，這不過只是一顆原子彈在大艦隊上空的爆炸。如果眞正戰爭中原子彈投下的數量較多，或者在水底爆發，情形當然又大不相同。</p>
<p>我們尤須了解，我們的城市，住屋，和工廠是不像軍艦那樣的堅牢，全是鋼板的。而城市與工廠却正是原子彈最理想的目標。無論如何，它在目前還是人類的破壞武器中最可怕的一種，我們簡直不能想像，將來一個國家如果受到一陣突然的原子彈攻擊時，會變成怎麼一種樣子。</p>

<p>— 謝水瑩</p>
<p>前言：漢口苦熱，想要寫點東西，還沒有寫下一百字，汗就如雨點一般滴在紙上，於是只好停下筆來看書，因爲看書，右手還可搖扇子，但是，看過之後，又想寫點什麽，記下自己的感想或心得，我希望多介紹幾位作家，尤其是在大戰中成名的，薩路衍的作品我看的並不多，但是對於那種堅苦舊鬥的精神，我是最欽佩的。——冰瑩附誌</p>
<p>威廉薩路衍是美國新進作家之一，今年只有三十八歲，但已成了美國第一流的作。在他的戲劇和小說裏，他打破了文學上的慣例，雖然他的作品，有時候免不了會感到粗俗，但是在趣味方面却是很高尚的。他固然不會墨守成規，但他還是有他自已的章法。</p>
<p>薩路衍生於一九〇八年，在兩歲的時候，他父親死了，家裏很窮，於是他母親就不得不把他送進孤兒院去。一直到七歲的時候，她在罐頭公司裏找到一個較爲優裕的工作，才又把薩路衍接回家來。可是十三四歲的威廉，就開始自己謀生：他當過電報局的報差，做過新聞記者，從這個時候，他就開始寫小說。十六歲那年，他到他伯父的葡萄園裏去作工，所以他對於這裏的生活是再熟悉沒有了，後來在他的小說裏常以此爲背景，第二年，他才離開家國到外鄕去。</p>
<p>在薩路衍的許多文章裏，都是反映他的童年，他把現實的社會通通搬上了他的舞台，像農村，紐約的咖啡店，西部的小城市，甚而至於那些莎漠地方等都成了他寫作的材料。在「機車三十八號」一篇小說裏，他描寫他年靑的時候和一位富有的紅人的故事，非常有趣。薩路衍一向都是選此簡單而美麗的背景作爲他寫作的根據，這當然是由於他的觀察精密，同時透視了社會的全部，他並不講究如何彫琢，如何推敲，但他有一種特有的樸素之美，生動而且深刻。</p>
<p>他的第一部小說集叫做「歧路上的勇士」，（The　Daring　Young　Man　on　the　Flying　Trapeze）深得文藝界的好評。自從這部作品出版之後，聲望日高，到一九三九年他改寫劇本，第一部就是（My　Hearts　Highland)他在這裏面表現了民主的成功，以後陸續地寫了很多劇本，「人類的喜劇」(Human　Comedy）一劇，已經製成電影了。</p>
<p>他在一九三九年所寫成的劇本，The　Time　of　YourLife？引起了很多人的讚美，因而獲得普利哲文學獎金，但他居然公開地拒絕接受這個獎金，他的理由是「商業員無權獎助文藝的。」</p>
<p>薩路衍沒有正式進過學校，但他憑需他的天才和他的努力，終於獲得了文學上很大的成就。當大戰爆發的時候，他毫不遲疑參加到部隊裏去工作。幾年來在海外的戰鬥生活，又給了他更多的寫作資料，我們且寫着讀他的新作吧。七，廿五於漢口</p>
<h3 id="c145">略輪詩之音樂性 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 周天牧</p>
<p>—音調與情調—</p>
<p>對於音樂的情調的感染，美國梵斯華茲氏（Farnsworth）及貝蒙氏（Bemont）兩敎授，曾舉行過一次實騐，他們呌一班學習繪畫的學生，聽兩種不同的曲調，並不宣佈曲名，聽後，呌他們把所得的意象繪在紙上，結果，竟沒有兩人所畫的情景是相同抑近似的，但是在這許多情景各異的貴片中，却找出一件統一的事來，這就是情調，悽慘哀怨時·畫面是　澹的，輕鬆愉快時，畫面是明朗的。這是指音樂而言，其實每一種藝術作品都盪漾着一種情調，不過表現的方式不同而已。而詩，這一切文學形式中的精靈，他是怎樣來表現使醞釀起他底情調呢；他是否可與音樂一樣地以音調訴諸聽覺而使受感染呢？</p>
<p>這就是詩之音樂性的問題。</p>
<p>按最初的詩，其產生是與謌相互混合的，是人們在高度的興奮極端的悲哀時，所透露出來的情感的呼聲，這是謌，也可說是詩，兩者不可分割，更無判然的區別可言，他們的分家還是後來的事。所以詩是脫胎於音樂（指詩謌合一的體裁）殆無疑義。表現派的美學家原以爲音樂是與語言同源的，最原始的樂器是聲帶，而同一的撀帶，在忿怒時與喜悅時所發的音調不同，聽者所感染的情調也不同。英人斯賓（Spencer）說：「音樂是一種光彩化了的語言」（Glorifial　Language）他以爲情感足以影響肌肉的伸縮，而肌肉伸縮的變化則又影響音調的宏纖高低。據其所言，器樂還是從胖樂演化而來的。所以我們可肯定地說，詩歌的工具是語言的音調—是含有意義的樂音—詩歌是音樂的一種，至少它是具有濃郁的音樂性的，它與普樂同樣地予聽者以固定的情調。而沈浸在其特製的氣氛里。</p>
<p>詩歌的音調何以能如樂音一般傳達情感呢？這個問題，以往學者只能以心理的變化（當然不指行爲心理）來解釋，現代實證美學家已能以種種儀器來測騐音調對血液循環心脈搏動的影響。佛斯脫（Foster）和干泊爾（Gembel）的研究報告爲：「聽音樂時的呼吸和平時工作時一樣地流動，不過平時呼吸是有規律的，聰音樂時的呼吸是不規則的」。孟慈（Mentz）發現凡在音調完全和諧時，音的强度突然更換時，或一曲將終時，血液的流動速度令較緩。海依脫氏（Ha．M．Hede）則更有精細的研究，獲得悲戚的音調使血液流速緩慢，高興的音調使血液流速加快的實證。這是一種說明，詩謌是以各種不同的音調來叩動聽者的耳膜，再傳入腦神經中樞，使其生理心理一應隨之變化，而從而產生與詩人所賦的同一的情感，激起同一的「衝動」，這種生理上所起的「內模仿」，就是使人在聽鏗鏘疾促的音調而覺宏偉，聽陰晦低沉的音調而感抑鬱的推動力。</p>
<p>在音樂中，古希臘人以E調爲安定，D調爲熱烈，B調為哀愁，G調爲浮躁，F調爲淫蕩。意大利學者又以和音的短二階爲悲哀，痛悼，疑慮，長三音階表示欣喜，勇敢，自信，熱望等，而又以短六階表示蕭條，靜穆……音樂就是以這些聲音的强弱，高低，疾徐的相互交替中表現情感。詩之音節階等雖未能如音榮之爲一一定型，然而他是以音調與音樂一般用來傳達情感，則爲千準萬確。</p>
<p>然而詩人却不若音樂家之幸運，音樂家所用的音，是充溢在宇宙每一角落，這種音經過物理學家正確的計算，音節的規律是被整理成爲一套完美無比的工具。音樂家只須以此現成的工具從事剏造，母庸顧慮藝術的本身，而詩人，其工具只是無秩序無規律的日常應用的蕪雜不堪的口語，混合，粗草，笨拙，難怪保羅凡樂希（Paul　Val＇ary）要感慨地說：「詩人是可憐的，詩人必須從瑣碎雜亂的名詞，及歷來所因習遺留的種種規例及種種不合邏輯的法則中搜索，這種規例與法則，不過是隨着某人或許多人偶爾隨意之所適，興之所至，率爾造出，加以詮解訓詁，於是厘定。」</p>
<p>爲着詩之內容與形式，也不知引起學者們多少次熱烈的辯論，不過無論如何若說詩離開音調（包括節奏音韻等）也能成立，等於說一個沒有高低强弱長短的音能編一支美妙的樂曲一樣地無稽。朱光潛先生就竭力批評過胡適博士五四運動時矯枉過正地所創導的詩用不着韻律的理論。其實詩不是斯賓塞所宗的純形式的玩意兒，也不是像胡適博士所主張的對內容過分强調而可將形式萎之於地的東西。荻原朔太郎在詩之原理一文中論及「詩之特色，未必是形式胡律的有無，也不是自由律的有無，其表現實關係於其本質是否爲「情象」——表現情感的意義的若實是「情象」，那言語必是使用「感情的語言」所具備的語韻，語調，語盛等一切違情的要素的緣故」。這也就說明是以內容來決定形式，而不是根本地　蔑形式，以內容所含的力爲中心，逐漸擴至於外，以內容來剏造形式，亦以形式來完成內容，沒有沒有技巧上的修養使有美好的形式來配合，縱有滿腔熱情，也是表達不出，我們可不必空泛地談理論，且看看我們目今的詩壇吧？詩歌的產量最多，編輯先生抽屜塞着塞着最多的是詩，其中固亦有好詩，但大部分，只是一些可厭的怪物，非驢非馬，這就是不講求（也許在講求中）形式或竟廢棄形式的風氣下所產生的實情。片上伊說得好，「詩歌之形式與內容，恰如江流之水與堤岸」，目今我國詩語，恰如黃河從舊漕移注新漕，在洶湧澎湃的河水冲激下（大時代的動爲所予吾人之刺激而是引起的情熱，還不够洶湧麼）崩坍不堪的新漕又不能配水流的力量，於是越堤泛濫，汪洋一片，弄得不堪收拾。所謂詩歌云云，觸目皆是一種分行繕寫的散文，是一切小說，越劇，報告文學，傳記等的避難所，這種詩的散文化是詩壇的破產現象，如何調整呢？記得在一次文藝晚會中，李健吾先生曾大聲疾呼形式的革命過，在詩歌就是要革詩歌散文化的命，詩歌是詩歌，散文是散文，本不可混爲一體，兩者相差之處在音調，而音調却又是詩歌的傳家之寳，是詩的生命綫，誰說格律（當然不指把平仄之類定型起來是鐐銬而謂新格律爲新鐐銬呢？）</p>
<p>五四後的一般格律詩人，崇尚法國家微的詩律，他們對語言音調的選擇是不過一番苦功的，不過後來到了一般頹廢派追求管能享受的詩人們筆下，音韻才爬入牛角尖裏去了。而今日之有詩歌散文化的反動，不能說與這是毫無關連的。</p>
<p>現在，所幸者，對詩之語言的追求，又呈蓬勃的風氣了，這實在是一種可喜的情景，不見詩謌的朗誦在盛行嗎？而各種方言，也在被試騐陶練中，如以奴儂吳語譯法文的詩，也有人以寜波土話朗誦列業託夫的譯詩，其他四川，揚州，上海等地的方言，也莫不在試騐推求中。這種大瞻的嘗試是對的，艾靑曾說：「詩人必須爲創造語言而有所冒險，一如採珠者爲了採擷珍珠而掙扎在海藻的糾纒裏，深沈到萬丈的海底」。沒有一個眞眞的詩人不是時時在找尋適當的語言，而把感情裝上去，向外發射的。使「他用一種迷人的單調使我們靜默，同時又以各種變化使我們醒着，它把我們安放在那種眞正出神的情態中，在那狀態中，靈魂脫離了意志的壓力而在象徵中顯示出來」（W．Ｄ．Yeots）使聽者陶醉在詩底情調中，這是詩歌的音調，與內義相扭合得最佳之時，是詩的精緻處，是詩藝登峰造極之時，正也是詩人們所終生夢寐追求的。</p>

<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>那個自耕農黃長貴，在這裏已經住了兩年多了。他的罪名是「殺人犯」，但實際上他却沒有殺過人，而是受人牽連了的，結果被寃枉地判處了無期徒刑。</p>
<p>他今年才二十九歲，矮矮的精壯的身材，剃光頭，多肉的臉龐，上面橫着兩撇濃黑的倒垂的八字眉，微腫的眼眶裏包着一雙遲鈍的眸子，圓鼻準，厚嘴唇，臉上帶着一股　態。身上穿着一套這班房當局借給的破棉服。</p>
<p>假如你問他當眞殺了人沒有？他會用憤怒的撀調肯定地說：「俺就是沒有殺到哉！是俺殺的，那就値得了　　死的那傢伙是一個甲長，臭（壞的意思）得很哪，沒有一個人不恨透他。」</p>
<p>長久坐班房，是可怕的事。他的一點家產，在這一次的官司上花光了。本來他家裏有個才二十歲的老婆，結婚了四五年，沒有生過兒女，在上一年裏，當他的案子判了下來之後，他的老婆就改嫁了，他得到了四千塊錢，也在這班房裏吃光了。現在他在外面沒有絲毫的接濟，只有一個出嫁了的窮姊姊，偶然上城的時候來探望過他一兩次。問他爲什麼要讓老婆改嫁，他說：「她要嫁人，俺又有什麽辦法？不知道要坐到什麼時候才能出去，難道要她活守着？」停了一下，他就接着描述着他的老婆的相貌：「大麻臉，斜眼珠，拐脚……長得三分不像人，四分不像鬼哉！」顯然，他是故意地把她描繪得那麽醜惡，藉來自己解嘲，其實，這事當然對他是個很大的打擊。他又嘆了一口氣說：「她現在嫁的那份人家還算好……」</p>
<p>在這班房裏，表面看起來他似乎還樂天，常常可以聽到他的笑聲——他就有着那麼一個愛笑的脾性，，任憑什麽事情，都可以引得他的一陣大笑，而且笑得那麼地響亮，那麽劇烈，像是用着全身的力量專心地在笑着。有一天，他不知怎地想起了，告訴人們說：「假如男扮女裝，關到女號子裏去，那就好戲（好玩的意思）哉！」說着，他又猛烈地笑着，笑得速腰都灣了起來，所以，這裏的難友們常常找着機會來逗引他發笑，最初只是他獨自一個人在笑着，一會兒之後，大家都被感染着了，形成了一陳哄笑，而他的那高吭的笑聲，超越過了週圍一切的笑聲，像是歌詠團裏的一個最高音，領導着這一個合唱。常常我們就陶醉在這笑聲裏，暫時忘懷了班房裹的愁苦。</p>
<p>經常的時候，他在這班房裏打着草鞋或者糊紙烟盒子，由於這種工作，他可以每頓多領四兩的糙米乾飯，和每一個月百把塊錢的賞與金，作爲在這裏添菜和零用。在沒有工可做的日子，他就替這裏有錢的難友擔任淸潔打掃，和其他的小差使，人家則拿剩飯給他做報酬。因爲他的食量很大，每天兩頓的囚糧在他是吃不飽的。</p>
<p>他在這裏的用度是很省的，連黃烟都不抽。但他却買了二十塊錢的毛邊紙，釘了一本簿子，請難友們替他抄上「千字文」一類的東西唸着。在這班房裏，這種讀書的風氣是很盛的，因爲吃了官司，就不能不跟那些白紙上的黑字發生接觸，什麽「起訴書」啦·「判決書」啦·「裁定書」。和「辯護狀」啦。「上訴等，這麽一連串傷腦筋的東西，都是跟每一個人有着切身關係的，可以決定自己的命運的，所以，進了班房以後，人們才嚐到了不識字的吃虧，同時，在外面時因爲生活的奔忙，有許多人沒有唸書的機會，在這讀書識字却變爲消磨時間的最好的辦法，而且向人討敎也非常便當，進到這班房裏，你可以看到這裏像是個補習學校，人們都三三兩兩地在讀書寫字，每個人坐了牢出去，多多少少總要認得幾個字的。</p>
<p>他沒事時就抱着那一本手抄簿子，一個字一個字地强記着，記不來時他就打着自己的腦壳子咒駡着：「操個娘，認不來哉！」或者他就拿幾張粗紙歪歪斜斜地臨着字，時時停下來吮着筆毫，弄得滿嘴墨瀋，一面傻笑着，就像私熟裏的　氣的學童似的。</p>
<p>有時候，他就整天躺在床上不做聲，只嘆着氣說：「班房難坐哉！」這時候，你如果問他爲什麼不唸書了，他就懶洋洋地答着：「沒得神氣哉！」</p>
<p>因為他是卅二年以前的案子，經過了一次的減刑，改判了十五年的有期徒刑。現在，又頒布了大赦令了，我祝禱着他能早日恢復自由。卅五年七月於上海。</p>

<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>臥病在床的時候，喜歡風雨而不喜歡太陽，透過朦朧的玻璃窗，看到外面風雨凄迷的景象，自有一種滿足，這種滿足幾乎是自私的—自己感到孤獨，希望這世界也不要太熱鬧，爲了免去對於塵世繁華的嫉妬，爲了免去許多不速之客的煩惱，連天風雨，倒格外顯得親切，一切不如意的煩心事，都在這荒凉的世界裏隱沒了，這時候，靜靜的躺在床上，閉了門，心裹有一種平安的感覺。</p>
<p>前些時候，從香港到上海，在船上過了三天，三天裏有時候跑到甲板上去看海，有時候躺在艙裏聊天，壁上的氣筒像漏斗似的，把外面浩渺的海風從小孔裏吹送進來，萬分淸冷，一隻船飄在大海上，整個的世界，世界上的痛苦和煩惱，喜悅和悲哀，都統統給海洋隔開了，默然躺在艙裏，有一種無憂無慮的滿足，彷彿是生活的假期。</p>
<p>這種假期有些人却不喜歡的，他們生命中的每一段時刻都預先安排好了，他們需要時時刻刻走進那熙攘繁華的世界裏，碰到雨天，他們不能穿最漂亮的衣裳，不能穿最乾净的鞋子，開開門一看，雨斜風狂，不得不穿上雨衣，戴上那蹩扭的帽子，小心的走路，在街上喊車……這一切煩惱瑣碎的事，他們討厭；還有一種人，可以不出門，却偏要找一些藉口出去玩玩，可是天在下雨，他們不時跑到窗口去探望，希望風雨早些停下來，對於這些人，風雨閉門的况味，是永遠不會被領略的。</p>
<p>現代人的生活，彷彿太侷促，侷促得毫無餘裕，要忙裏偸閑，生病似乎是最好的也是唯一的藉口，不過躺在床上，假如天氣好的話，還不免看到那刺眼的陽光，還不免聽到那繁華的市聲，於是有一種被冷落了的凄涼感覺，被快樂拋撇了的懊惱，這時候多麼希望天氣霎的變一下—滿室涼風，漫天風雨，雖然十在病房裏，也仿佛是亞當昔年避難的小舟！</p>
<p>我常常想一個年事已高的人，已經不希望在這世界上角逐，已經把痛苦和快樂視同一律的時候，把他的書齋題名爲「風雨閉門齋」，該是多麼智慧的事！他和這世界隔了，却沒有離開它，他可以在靜觀中看這個世界，看這世界上的痛苦和煩惱，悲哀和喜悅；看這世界上的擾擾攘攘，碰到眞正下雨的時候，他不免忙亂一番，趕緊去關窗子，却忘記了門，門上的幾個大字「風雨閉門齊」，或許已經給風雨吹掉了。</p>

<p>— 雪華</p>
<p>去年今天，我像一頭被困的小獸，躱在一間冷冷凄凄的小屋子裏，一位朋友來看我了，我伸出一條黃疲的手臂圍住了她，興奮地說：</p>
<p>「朋友，今天怠慢了你，但是明年今天，若是我還活着，我一定要戀情紫金色的薄紗裝飾我的門窗，用嫩黃的軟綢做成美麗的檯毯，用錄色的瓶子插上紅色的鮮花，用驟香的百合花露噴洒每一個角落。啊！朋友！那時候，我要請你到這裏來，來和我一同喝一杯葡萄酒，來慶祝黑夜的過去，光明的來臨，自由和快樂的光焰放射到天下萬方！哦，朋友，你想這日子會得來到嗎？」</p>
<p>朋友微微地笑了，答道：「當然！」</p>
<p>生命是一朶無定向的雲霧，推動雲霧的是不可捉摸的幻夢！</p>
<p>我不敢說完全相信這句話，可是我確曾在幻夢中打發去了孤苦的童年，寂寞的青春；又確曾在幻夢中度過許多凄涼的歲月。</p>
<p>去年今天，我何嘗不担心自己的希望會像一個美麗的皂泡，剎那之間就要破滅。我又何嘗不担心朋友的微笑會像西天的一抹夕陽，一轉瞬間就要消逝。然而我還在希冀着「萬一」：——</p>
<p>萬一我的幻夢成了眞！萬一朋友的「當然」會得實現！……</p>
<p>「我不能悲觀，我要期待！」我這樣勉勵自己，安慰自已。於是一年很快地過去了。</p>
<p>今年今天，我還活着，我的朋友又來到我這個冷冷凄凄的小屋子裏。</p>
<p>那裏有什麼紫金色的薄紗？那裏有什麼嫩黃的軟綢？那裏有什麼紅花香露，葡萄美酒？更那裏有什麼光明自由和快樂？……是我欺騙了她，還是她欺騙了我，大家都茫然。</p>
<p>「不要失望，期待着明年的今天吧！」握着我冰冷的手，朋友還想掙扎。</p>
<p>「是的，期待着明年的今天吧！」我也還想掙扎。</p>
<p>然而我們終於一齊哭起來了！——可憐的謊話呀！今年今天，我們還能有什麽勇氣敢去想像明年的今天？</p>

<p>一個朋友從前服務於開藻煤礦，他告訴我許多礦上的風景，其中之一是他本身的寳地試騐。他說：「礦穴深入地底，那又是一個世界。平常我們所不易見到以及從未見到的各種虫豸，礦上人却「家常便飯」，無足爲奇了。因爲這樣環境的關係，所以有一年的端午節，忽然想起作一個試騐，試騐一下一在這許多虫豸中，究竟哪一種最兇，最毒。</p>
<p>我找了一隻大面盆，也找了一塊大玻璃蓋在面盆上費了半天功夫，捉到壁虎，蝎子，蜈蚣，蛇虺，蜂，蜮，蜘蛛，還有許多不知名的小動物，把牠們統統放在這隻面盆裏。</p>
<p>這眞是一幕奇觀，最劇烈最緊張的厮殺，噬嚙，追逐，跳躍，撕扭，以及掙扎，每一個都使出牠的渾身解數來。在幾小時的斷續搏鬥中，我驚心動魄地欣賞着，但，令我特別發生興趣的，是那隻像大姆指般的蜘蛛，牠自始至終所採取的戰術都是躱閃，避免和任何虫豸作正面衝突，可是牠一面逃竄一面拚命吐絲，連綿不斷地吐織牠的網羅，人們也許不相信，牠那小小軀體所製造出的武器却將大半個面盆都縱橫佈置起來，結果是可以想像的，其牠的不是奄奄待斃，就是力竭聲嘶，一隻一隻都就縛在牠的絲網中，而牠，這隻祗有姆指大的蜘蛛却安閒地踞坐在網的冷落一角，看模樣，也有點疲乏，可是疲乏之中也得意於所獲之豐當罷！</p>
<p>以後幾天，是牠舒徐地享受的日子了？連死帶活，直到一一膏　爲止。」</p>
<p>這個故事所帶給我們的是什麽？</p>
<p>是那根極纖細極織細的蛛絲的威力嗎？</p>

<p>常東娥案已於日前（廿二）公開審訊，俞黃兩股長似乎穩若泰山地上庭聽審；常東娥的母親當庭大哭，駡俞黃二人爲：「兩個殺坯」。並謂査封時彼家僅有三間半房子竟貼了二十八張封條之多。庭上趣事還有一件，是俞黃二人請來的×律師强要說話時，被檢察官阻止，旁聽席上大開汽水，連連報律師以噓噓之聲。聽審的計有二百餘人，蘇地人士均爲之側目。唯當日出版之「新蘇日報晚刋」，載有其審訊結果，則檢察官需要常東娥的母親搜集俞黃二人的貪汚受賄證據後，方能再審。各界與論似對此舉甚爲不滿。蘇地常東娥案後援會已另提是議，或因檢察官要常母搜集俞黃受賄證據爲過份勉强，且頗有偏袒彼等之嫌疑也！</p>

<p>— 方君</p>
<p>澳門爲葡萄牙的統治地，在歷史上祇是一個模糊的根據，然這已經是不少年數的事情，比之南京條約的香港更屬遙遠。但這巴掌大小的一個所在，在政治的外交上似乎不大引起若何的注意的，可是地方雖然不很重要，終是廣東民族尤其是中山縣民的一個最爲惡劣的影響。這目然是在她所採取底殖民地政策的上頭，與我們國內政治大大相反。因此，這許多年來，也許是它自有統治地的歷史以來，除了烟，賭和娼與及在政治上祇是一個中國歹徒的逋亡之地而已。</p>
<p>然而這個地方終竟給中國政治忽略去了，而民眾對它也好像一個不甚要緊的　　，或者視同一個垃圾罔，許多人都不正眼一視。</p>
<p>最近它突然然增兵，武器也來了不少。這批增兵是千餘名的黑人兵，從帝汶島轉調而來的，是守衛帝汶島底葡國的正規部隊，所以裝備也還齊全。紙是不明用意。澳門政府對這次增兵也不曾說出理由來，我們在新聞報道上所獲知的是這批部隊來了之後，舊有的士兵便改爲警察。那末，警察的力量也因此加强了。</p>
<p>澳門究竟受到什麽的威脅而致加強防衛？是不是爲了前山有了中國駐軍？前山一向是有中國部隊在駐防的，但總是爲數不多，更是對澳門並沒有甚麽意圖或者意向，而且中國駐軍的任務並不在此，澳門政府想也不至於如此大驚小怪罷。然則它有甚麽事實作爲增兵的根據呢？除了葡萄牙政府怕沒有別人曉得了！</p>
<p>有人以爲美國想租用路　關爲機塲，澳門政府就擬從佳司蘭砲臺築一座鐵橋，與路　聯成一氣，故先事增兵，以加强防衛。這不是成其爲理由的，更不能作為事實的根據。因爲美國要租用路灣，就得要問中國政府，葡萄牙人沒有這種租借權，更無所用其增兵防衛。又有人以爲是要保護高可寗和傅老容這兩位大亨」才不惜勞師動衆。這話初聽好似有葡萄牙人的理由。原因那兩位中國的漢奸就是澳門政府的財神菩薩。高可寗等早就被嚴密保護着了，不祇他們的出人有武裝的</p>

<p>一個美軍在柏林和一個紅軍討論他們的政府。那美軍對紅軍說，「你可以到華盛頓的白宮求見杜魯門總統，敬候起居，然後竪起手指頭到總統的面前，批評杜魯門的好醜。」</p>
<p>那紅軍說，「你可以到克姆林宮求見史太林元帥，敬候起居，然後把手指頭指到史太林元帥的面前的面葡警跟隨，住宅也特設防綫六道。但這是多餘的，也許就是澳門政府的庸人自擾，待中國政府行文要求引渡時，那個怕他不將兩人交出？是以我認爲連也不是澳門政府作爲事實的根據。（月前報載，關建機場事，美國經已作為罷論）。</p>
<p>然則葡萄牙政府爲甚麽增兵澳門呢？遠東又有甚麽國際戰爭了嗎？日本人投降了之後，澳門才受到戰爭的威脅嗎？澳門政府不能不有所說明了。（七·二十三。）</p>

<p>和朋友借一本書，承她很爽氣的馬上答應了。因爲迫切的需要，所以天天催她，一連催了兩個星期，依然沒有拿到書，她給我的答覆總是「明天」。</p>
<p>得到這個結果以後，我再也不跟她提起了，假使我再問她，實在難以爲情。這好像不是借書，而是向她討債了。好在我不是討債的，不然的話，我會到除夕的那一天去討，使她無法再回「明天」。</p>
<p>現在，我深深地領悟了，一般人的毛病不守時間，拖延·懶惰，只要有一分鐘一秒的時間，都盡量的拖。</p>
<p>幸虧上帝將宇宙間天然的造有一個「明天」給人利用，否則這些常常失約的人將無退步之餘地。</p>
<p>曾記得在成都的某一個機關裏，下班前十分鐘，辦公廳主任接到一份公事，他爲了自己急於回家吃晚飯陪太太看電影，心裏想：「反正只差十分鐘下班了不如明天再辦吧！」於是，匆匆忙忙的將案卷帶回去了。第二天，他又健忘的沒有這案卷帶到辦公室去，而放在家裏，以致第三天第四天……直到兩個月還是放在家裏。</p>
<p>不料，過了不久，上峯命令追究這件案卷，翻來覆去找不倒，他急得要命，只得向秘書及各科長下一道緊急命令：「即刻査」，査來查去，始終查不出，他大發雷霆向秘書打官腔，秘書向科長打官腔，科長向科員打官腔，依舊無着落。過了幾天，忽然在他的兒子手上發現了，原來他的兒子很頑皮，做風箏沒有紙，隨心所欲的拿這份案卷糊風箏，眞是異想天開，他看到以後，氣得無話可說，紙好向上峯認罪，上峯認為此事非同小可，「玩忽公務貽誤戎機」着即撤職。</p>
<p>還有一次，也是在成都，某軍事教育機關的幾院，有一天例假的晚上一個學生患了急性盲腸炎，抬到醫院裏請醫，碰巧一個勤務兵打電話給院長，回電謂：「今天休假，而且天又晚了，先送他到病房裏去，明天再來替他着，」勤務兵遵命將病人送進病室裏，可是等到「明日」早晨院長來時，這個學生已經死了。</p>
<p>明日復明日，明日永不來，但是爭取時效，寸陰是惜却是一切成功的要素！</p>

<h3 id="c157">無綫電傳真的故事 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 佐萎</p>
<p>電傳照相術的發明，早在公元一九二四年。那時美國克利芙蘭的電信局就利用了電綫，將幾張伊利湖畔的風景照片傳到紐約，四十四分鐘後，歷史上第一次的電傳照相就在紐約時報上出現。所以，電傳照相術發展到今天，已足足有二十二年了。</p>
<p>此後，經過了十年的實騐和研究，它已組具規模了；但樣的：倫敦傳出了一張英皇喬治五世的照片，在收到後感到非常的模糊。經過詳細的觀察，他們覺得很奇怪；在英皇左腰上部有一塊像勳章似的灰色墨蹟是什麼呢？更奇怪的是他的下巴像小孩子一樣，原來他那著名心愛的鬍子已告失蹤。最後，總算把事情弄清楚了，因為在傳影的過程中，某部分機械急轉了一下，所以不巧就把鬢子搬到腰際上去了。這一次小的挫折使科學家努力去改進終於獲得了最大的成功。</p>
<p>在這次大戰中，無綫電傳眞照相發揮了最高的效能，得到了無上的功績，大部分的城市如斯德哥爾摩·莫斯科·里斯本·開羅·伊斯坦布爾·昆明·重慶·巴黎·布魯塞爾，以及非洲的小城市也都有這種收　機的設備，把眞實的新聞消息用電傳照相的方式傳播出去。</p>
<p>說起中國的有這中設備，也有一件很有趣的事情：在一九四二年的時候，一件有意義的歷史性文件從中國傳到洛杉磯。這是蔣主席寄給羅斯福總統的一封慶賀中美用無綫電照相聯絡成功的中文信；當時，美國的海軍當局和新聞記者們都感到手足無措，沒有人能够將它譯出，最後在深夜二點鐘，踏遍了洛杉磯的唐人街，方才找到了一個中國人，他很快樂地把它朗誦出來，興奮的不僅這一點，而是在於祖國通訊工作的驚人發展。</p>
<p>電傳照相術發明以來，被應用得很廣：</p>
<p>一個住在大西徉沿岸新澤西城的心臟病患者，他將兩張心臟搏動次數的表格，電傳到芝加哥某心臟病專家那裏去，一小時後，病人已得到了醫生診斷書的回電。</p>
<p>美國的詹姆斯將軍將一張一千元支票的照相，自倫敦傳出，紐約的銀行信託部在數分鐘內接到，立刻兌現。紐約警局捉到了一個嫌疑犯，當他的指印電傳到芝加哥警局，將存案翻出來對證一下，數分鐘內罪據確立，使罪犯無法狡辯。</p>
<p>戰時納粹集中營的種種慘酷殘忍的暴行，使人幾乎難以置信，直到無綫電照相將它的情形忠實地記錄傳佈出來，大家方才深信不疑。</p>
<p>當大家都在懷疑着墨索里尼的死亡時，可是電傳照相已將墨魔臥屍米蘭的醜態傳出，把一切的謠言謊語全部打倒。</p>
<p>這就是二十世紀的人們的「電眼」！</p>
<h3 id="c158">獨身與貞潔 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 王凌</p>
<p>獨身和貞潔的意義，可說是完全相異的，前者是永續的，組織的抑制戀愛；而後者是永續的組織的抑制情慾。</p>
<p>因此，所謂貞潔並不是戀愛的否定，而是戀愛的準備，這確實是探求戀愛，希冀獲得戀愛者資格的行爲及理想，是一個靑年男女所不可不深切加以研究探討的問題．因爲，貞潔是靑年期最崇高的道德之一，貞潔的重要，雖爲今日關心戀愛問題者論之再三，但依舊毫無結果。</p>
<p>那不消說是爲了他們的解釋和獨身混同不分所致。而獨身却是人生的曲解，人生之智的，道義的疾患之一獨身理想的起源，是極容易解釋的，當人類在發展的某一階段，啓開了心眼，愛他主義和同情的想像生活，映入了某種人的心眼之中。以普通言語來講，就是人類發現了自身的精神的性質。但常時的狀態是怎樣的？外界的一切抑止住那種性質，企岡把它葬送到泥土之中。在那破壞的勢力裏，最爲强烈者，是性·常這性的力量作用起來的時候，會全然不理解人類的更高的理想，一味的餌食人類，而供自己的便宜。當它逞威的時候，更會把金錢，健康，時間，名譽，以及其他的一切從人類中奪去。世界賢人，老法郎士，培根，曾說過這樣的一句話：「結婚而生子的是束縛自己」的手足。」倍根向沙漢中逃去，爲的是發現了這個惡鬼居住在自己的精神之中了。他隱匿在岩窟之中，忍飢絕食，讓蟲風任意侵襲。一味想根絕在身內燃燒着的性的衝動。</p>
<p>僧院和修道院的建造，宗敎上的修養，其出發點完全和這相同，這種把性的關係視爲罪惡，隋落的思想，甚至浸透著現代人的思想，文學，社會因襲，法律等各方面，妨礙了戀愛的眞實的理解，阻止了由戀愛而到達健康幸福的大道。</p>
<p>獨身的理想，是一種智戀的，道義的疾患，對於自然的　瀆。自然爲了打破它傾注了所有的能力，而方告成功。</p>
<p>獨身還具有另一種形式，那並不由於宗敎的觀念，而是起自經濟的原因。帶着純然的利己性質，那旣沒有組織，也沒有理論的根據。在高呼「獨身生活」的形式上產生了老小賣淫制度。不問其原因是家敎的，還是經濟的，總之，任何形式的獨身，決不能和承認戀愛，尊重戀愛的貞潔相一致。貞潔是戀愛的準備，但是，如果因了法律，或是社會的因襲，或是經濟的壓迫，而禁止戀愛，那麽，所謂貞潔或童貞，將化爲理想家的幻想了。</p>

<p>讓我報道兩件事：</p>
<p>我們的學校因爲地處滬市東郊，差不多全部同學都是寄宿的，膳費按月繳付，上學期結束前的第三期膳費，因爲期近大考，同學在校溫課，都不及歸家取錢，於是，學校當局出了一張堂　的佈告：</p>
<p>「茲經校政委員會義決，凡第三期膳費不付者，本學期所讀學分一槪不計，望勿自說，切切此佈。」</p>
<p>還有，學期結束，照章須付留額金，但學校當局規定，逾期者留額金加倍繳付。</p>
<p>爲了上面兩件事而所得的處分，我認爲頗堪耐味！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Marshal Ma Left Kuling for Nanjing Yesterday; Will Invite Zhou Enlai to Lushan for Talks; U.S. Ambassador Resting Under Doctor's Orders <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] Special Envoy Marshal left Kuling for Xun in the rain at 2:50 PM on the 30th, and returned to Nanjing by plane. At 12:30 PM on the 30th, Marshal Ma and his wife went to the Chairman's Office to say goodbye. The Chairman invited them to lunch. After the meal, Marshal Ma also went to the U.S. Embassy to visit Ambassador Stuart, who was resting. They talked for about a quarter of an hour before he left. Staff Officer Pi Zonggan accompanied Marshal Ma on the flight back to Nanjing. It is said that he may come to Kuling again this Friday.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Paper, 30th] Special Envoy Marshal left Kuling on the afternoon of the 30th and returned to Nanjing. When he arrived at Dajiaochang Airport, it was already 7:05 PM, and he returned to the residence at 7:30 PM. Only three of his entourage, including his adjutant, arrived in Nanjing with him. Although Marshal Ma arrived in Nanjing very late, all parties have been paying close attention to his meeting with the Communist Party representatives. It is rumored that after returning to Nanjing, Marshal Ma will invite Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai to Lushan and first convey the results of his talks with Chairman Chiang over the past few days as a basis for continued talks. However, as of 11:00 PM, Zhou Enlai had not yet received an appointment from Marshal Ma, so a formal meeting may be scheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] According to an authoritative source who told this newspaper's reporter, the recent reports in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai that the Military Three-Person Conference will be held in Nanjing or Kuling is purely speculation. The main task of the Military Three-Person Conference is to study how to implement the troop reorganization plan, and at present, the Communist Party has not shown the sincerity it should have in this regard. The so-called conference will be held soon is too premature.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] Ambassador Stuart had another high fever of 39 degrees last night. He also had a slight sweat last night, but he improved this morning, and his temperature dropped to 37 degrees in the afternoon. At 1:30 PM, Marshal Ma, accompanied by U.S. Army medical officer Dr. Habis, who had just arrived in Kuling from Nanjing, and Dr. Buck of the U.S. Embassy, ​​examined Ambassador Stuart. The blood test results showed that the condition was not serious. The ambassador is now resting under doctor's orders, eating less food. Today, he only had a small amount of orange juice and liquid drinks, and did not eat anything else.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 30th] Chairman Chiang is very concerned about Ambassador Stuart's health. In addition to sending his own medical officer to diagnose and treat him, and sending staff to visit him, he also presented several bottles of orange juice today. In addition, Marshal Marshall, before leaving Kuling, telegraphed two famous American doctors in Nanjing, who arrived in Kuling on the 30th to treat the ambassador. Their diagnosis results were completely consistent with the diagnosis report of the National Government's medical officer, and found that the ambassador had no symptoms, only indigestion. After all, the ambassador, at the age of 73, traveled between Nanjing and Kuling, where the temperature difference is 20 degrees, which is enough to affect his digestion. Ambassador Stuart is still resting at his residence under doctor's orders today.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, This Paper, 30th] Our troops advancing towards Qutang have been in constant fierce battles with the Communist troops for several days. According to the military here, the recovery of Qutang is only a matter of time, and the meeting with the troops in Haian is just around the corner. There are about five regiments of Communist troops in the Haian area.

It is generally expected that this deployment of the Communist troops is to prepare for another large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian, This Paper, 29th] Three regiments of Communist troops were found east and north of Jiangyan, attempting to attack Jiangyan. The National Army has sent troops to search. There are also Communist troops and militias harassing the area around Gubaozhuang and Lao Zhuang in Taixian.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Zhou Enlai's Speech; Believes the Situation is Extremely Serious <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 30th] Zhou Enlai made his first public speech today after talking with Ambassador Stuart, saying that the overall situation in China is extremely serious. When asked about the conflict near Beiping, he claimed that he had not heard of it before meeting the journalists, nor had he seen it reported in the newspapers. Regarding the incident of the seven U.S. soldiers being captured, he said that the Communist troops only disarmed them, treated them quite well, and eventually returned the weapons together. The CCP hopes that Americans will take a friendly attitude towards the Communist troops and that such incidents will not happen again. The general reaction of the government today is that the Communist troops' attack on the U.S. military is an extension of the movement in Yan'an to incite American public opinion and expel the U.S. military. The Communist side believes that a conflict with the U.S. military, even if the Communist troops openly violate it, can produce the desired effect. Zhou Enlai spoke about the current military and political situation, and again demanded an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire, followed by the restoration of transportation and an agreement on supplementary conditions for the troop reorganization plan. It is said that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart both want to maintain peace in China. Zhou said at the end that he had no plans to go to Lushan.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] Today, the Lushan edition of the Nanchang Lixing Daily published an article refuting the errors in the Ta Kung Pao editorial "The Gradual International Interference" on the 27th of this month, and explained based on international law that the resolutions of the U.S., British, and Soviet foreign ministers' meeting held in Moscow in December last year had no effect since China had not participated in it beforehand and had never taken any action afterward. Subsequently, it cited the historical facts of the development of national revolutions in the world in the past 30 years, and the clear examples of the National Government constantly destroying the aggressive elements of strong forces and the new and old warlords who were running dogs of aggressive elements amidst international interference. In addition, it analyzed the clear mission of the U.S. military in China, and believed that this was the obligation that the U.S. should fulfill for its ally China, and should not be misinterpreted. Finally, it sternly warned the author of the Ta Kung Pao editorial, saying that the National Government has a firm position in order to safeguard national independence and maintain national survival, and will not be intimidated by empty words. After the article was published, it has attracted great attention from people in Kuling due to its correct argument, detailed citations, and sharp writing style.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th] This morning, the U.S. Marine Corps authorities issued an official statement in Tianjin for the first time on the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps road guard team, stating: U.S. military aircraft have been ordered to dispatch assistance to drive out the Communist troops. The statement was issued by Walton Leach, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps, at a press conference held in Tianjin this morning. He admitted that both the U.S. Marine Corps and the Communist troops had casualties, but did not mention the number of deaths. The outline of his statement is as follows: The motorized patrol team of the First Division of our army was ambushed at 12:15 yesterday on the way from Tianjin to the destination, near the Da Xia Shahe (transliteration) north of Hexiwu, about 35 miles southeast of Beiping. The troops attacking the patrol team were Chinese armed forces in military uniforms, about 300 people. Our side sent a strong motorized patrol team yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, covered by the air force, to provide assistance. Our side has casualties, and the troops attacking our side also have casualties. We do not intend to comment on this issue much at this time. It is confirmed that a patrol team of about 300 people has rushed to the scene of the incident to assist the besieged U.S. Marine Corps, and according to one source: By the time the patrol team arrived at the battlefield, the battle was almost over, but the team continued to drive towards Beiping, clearing the remaining enemy nests on the highway. The patrol team is fully equipped, with light machine guns, grenade launchers, hand grenades, carbines, and rifles. The team also used reconnaissance trucks and scout jeeps to drive from Tianjin to Beiping. It is also confirmed that another patrol team of 300 people in Beiping was also ready to go yesterday afternoon, preparing to rush to the aid of the besieged U.S. military, but the team was not sent out. The Communist troops were dispersed after several hours of fighting. According to sources from all parties here: The battle broke out when the Communist troops opened fire with rifles and machine guns from both sides of the highway. The original U.S. patrol team of 100 people broke through the barbed wire stretched across the highway. It is said that the Communist troops were wearing grass-green uniforms and had complete light weapons. The cover planes used to rescue them are believed to be several Marine Corps fighter jets. The rescue troops transported several wounded Marine Corps members to Beiping and immediately sent them to the hospital.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Paper, 30th] Regarding the request from the China Democratic League that the government allow it to invite U.S. representatives to form a three-person investigation committee to jointly investigate the assassination of Li and Wen in Kunming, this morning at 10:00, government representative Wu Tiecheng conveyed the content of the Chairman's reply to the China Democratic League. Wu said: There are many representatives sent by the government to Kunming, so there is no need to send more, but the government is willing to send personnel to take care of the China Democratic League personnel going there, and provide them with convenient transportation and safe and smooth investigation. The China Democratic League can accept this opinion and decided to send representatives Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin to Kunming, but still expressed the hope that they can investigate together.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Du and Li Talks Yield No Results on the Overall Northeast Issue; But the Status Quo in Ningjing Can Continue to be Maintained <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Paper, 30th] Wang Zhimin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Xingying, Cai Zonglian, Military Regulation, and Li Minran, Lin Biao's representative, held a trial talk at 4:30 PM on the 29th on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war on both sides. The government side advocated that both sides immediately release the prisoners of war. Li said that Lin Biao did not authorize him, so he could not negotiate fully. Therefore, although it took a long time, it was only limited to exchanging opinions and no concrete results were obtained.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 29th] Although Li Minran's visit to Shenyang this time is still far from fundamental agreement on the Northeast issue, a relatively peaceful status quo may be maintained. It is said that he once expressed on behalf of Lin Biao that the Communist troops will never attack, and Du Yuming also frankly stated that as long as the Communist troops do not attack or cause trouble, the National Army will never fire the first shot. (2) Du Yuming told reporters that he had exchanged views with Li on the overall issue in principle, and it was regrettable that no results were obtained in the past two days. (3) The issue of power transmission in Shenyang was resolved by Dong Wenqi and Li Minran. Shenyang City will soon be bright again. The reason why this issue can be resolved is that the Harbin power grid is under the control of the National Army. After this method was agreed upon, both parties no longer had the fear of power outages.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] Cai Zonglian and Li Minran flew to Changchun from Shenyang at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Lin Biao's representative Li Minran had a seven-hour conversation with Commander Du over the past two days. Both sides expressed strong views on the military conflict, and neither side will attack in the future. In addition, there were also discussions on the transfer of electricity to Xiaoxing, the exchange of prisoners, the repatriation of Japanese residents in the Communist-controlled areas, and the repair of the Songhua River Bridge. A Central News Agency reporter visited Commander Du, Li Minran, and Colonel Norman, the U.S. representative of the Executive Group, separately to inquire about the results and impressions of the negotiations. Li said that he had talked with Commander Du twice in the past two days. Commander Du expressed his opinions frankly, not only involving general small issues, but also fundamental issues in the Northeast. When the reporter asked about the opening of the Zhongchang Road, Li said that this issue should be realized as soon as possible, and the Communist troops are very willing to promote it, but the specific method should be agreed upon immediately. The reporter then asked Commander Du for his opinion. Du said that he was very welcome and excited that Mr. Li could represent Mr. Lin Biao in negotiating the overall issue in the Northeast, but he regretted that no results were obtained in the past two days. In general, both sides exchanged opinions on principle. In short, any issues that can be resolved are hoped to be resolved immediately. As for avoiding conflict, I guarantee that there will be no problems as long as the Communist troops do not disturb the National Army. The opening of the Zhongchang Road should be realized as soon as possible in order to relieve the suffering of the people. At the same time, repairing the Songhua River Bridge is for the sake of construction and the people's livelihood, and the bridge should be completed as soon as possible. The reporter then asked the U.S. representative Colonel Norman about this issue. He expressed three opinions: first, stop the conflict; second, restore traffic immediately so that the people can get food; third, political issues should be resolved according to public opinion. After hearing this, Li immediately proposed that the Changchun Executive Department study and solve the plan. Commander Du said: The Changchun Executive Department will never oppose it, because this matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood, and besides, the bridge is in the hands of the National Army, so there should be no problem in restoring it. Colonel Norman agreed with Commander Du's opinion, and Li explained that there is no problem with general bridges, but today's repair of the Songhua River Bridge between Chang and Ha inevitably has strategic significance. Colonel Norman suggested that a neutral zone be set up on the bridge. Commander Du believed that after the bridge was repaired, he could guarantee that the National Army would never attack, and the Executive Group could send personnel to station on the bridge. Colonel Norman smiled and agreed. Commander Du then smiled and said: Is Colonel Norman willing to go? Colonel Norman smiled and replied that he was willing to go. Commander Du also said: The purpose of building this bridge is for construction and rural revitalization. Colonel Norman also agreed with this point and said: If the National Army attacks, the route will not be limited to this bridge. Finally, Li accepted Commander Du's bridge repair plan and said that he was willing to do his personal best to promote its realization and report to Lin Biao after returning to Harbin.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Legislative Yuan Interrogation of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA): Heated Debate at Routine Meeting; Director Jiang Attends and Answers Item by Item <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] During this morning's Legislative Yuan routine meeting, a heated debate erupted between Executive Yuan UNRRA Director Jiang Tingfu and members of the Legislative Yuan regarding post-war relief and rehabilitation efforts. This verbal battle began with Zhang Zhaoyuan, convener of the Legislative Yuan's Nine-Member Committee, launching an attack. Representing the committee, he presented five questions to the UNRRA Director based on their findings: (1) Why was cotton sold to Shanghai textile mills at low prices, while the administration sat idly by as these mills reaped exorbitant profits? (2) Why was it possible to sell 59,000 tons of flour in Shanghai alone, while the extensive disaster areas of Henan and Hunan provinces received only tens of thousands of tons? (3) Why, with Henan suffering a black fever epidemic and a 90% mortality rate, were over 8,700 tons of relief medicines stockpiled in Shanghai, while Henan province had yet to receive any? (4) Why were supplies stockpiled in Shanghai warehouses, resulting in relief goods being unable to unload upon arrival in Shanghai and being redirected to other countries? (5) Why, with the inefficiency of foreign ships in transporting relief supplies, did the government prioritize foreign shipping, disregarding the opposition of domestic shipping companies? Zhang concluded by stating: According to Finance Minister Yu's report, the government's post-war relief and rehabilitation fund of 432 billion had been fully allocated, of which 28.9 billion was for the UNRRA's administrative expenses. With UNRRA branch offices established in 15 districts and employing over 5,000 personnel, such a massive organization and ample funding ran counter to the original purpose of post-war relief and rehabilitation. It has resulted in our country's inability to effectively utilize the received materials, with goods being discarded, leading to the UNRRA's suspension of shipments. Director Jiang immediately responded: (1) Most of the materials stockpiled in Shanghai were machines that could not be shipped. (2) Most of the medical supplies were hygiene and medical equipment. (3) The previous sales of relief goods were with the consent of the UNRRA, aimed at recovering legal tender and stabilizing prices. Finally, Director Jiang frankly admitted that due to the different viewpoints on relief issues between the donor countries and the recipient country, the UNRRA's work was quite unsuccessful. After Director Jiang finished speaking, members Huang Yinggan, Sun Jiulu, Chen Zifeng, Peng Zuishi, Wei Tingsheng, Zhong Tianxin, Jian Guansan, and others spoke up one after another, raising questions about (1) the UNRRA staff's excessively high salaries, (2) the accounting system's non-compliance with government regulations, and (3) the alleged corruption in the transportation of relief rice to Guangdong. Director Jiang promised to thoroughly investigate the corruption allegations and handle them according to law, but stated that the slightly higher salaries for staff were precisely intended to prevent corruption. Until 11:30 AM, Director Jiang requested to leave due to other matters, but many members continued to criticize the UNRRA's measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held its 305th meeting today, presided over by President Sun, with Vice President Wei, who recently took office, also attending for the first time. In the morning, UNRRA Director Jiang gave a report and answered questions from the members. In the afternoon, the following important cases were passed: (1) The draft amendment to the Goods Unified Tax Regulations was resolved to be amended and passed. (2) The draft amendment to the National Product Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations was resolved to be passed. (3) The Standard Law draft was resolved to be returned to the Economic and Legal Affairs Committees for re-examination. (4) The draft amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization was resolved to be ratified. (5) The draft legislative principles for amending the Customs Import and Export Tariff were amended and passed, and submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council. (6) The draft regulations for the organization of the Agricultural and Forestry Department's Cattle Improvement and Breeding Farm was resolved to be passed. (7) The draft regulations on housing leasing after demobilization were resolved to be returned to the Civil Law, Economic, and Land Law Committees for joint review.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Measures for Collecting and Exchanging Northeast Soviet Military Scrip Determined: Official Exchange Rate to be Determined After Collection <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Beiping, 29th] The temporary measures for the collection and exchange of Northeast Soviet military scrip have been agreed upon by the Northeast Headquarters Economic Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Holders of Soviet military scrip can temporarily exchange it for 10% of circulating banknotes at the Central Bank, with the remaining 90% issued a receipt by the Central Bank. The official exchange rate and refund method will be determined after the military scrip is collected. The authorities have taken this measure because the exact number of Soviet military scrip issued is unknown, so they have decided to determine the exchange rate after collection.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Jiyang, 30th] On the 29th, newspapers reported that the authorities had drafted measures to handle Soviet Red Army scrip circulating in various parts of Northeast China, and that they would be officially announced soon. This immediately caused unrest in the market. Some people were picky about slightly damaged or soiled scrip and refused to accept it. Others, although they did not dare to openly refuse to use it, raised prices to resist it. It is said that many raised prices by 20%. Large-scale transactions agreed in advance what kind of scrip would be used for the transaction. The Central Bank never accepts Red Army scrip, while China, Communications, Farmers, and general local commercial banks still accept it, but those who deposit Red Army scrip are marked on the receipt. Many street vendors and rickshaw pullers refuse to accept Red Army scrip. The general opinion and newspaper editorials are that the government should immediately announce the handling measures to avoid causing financial chaos and public unease.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Unfolding a New Page in Sino-British Relations <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Our newly appointed ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, has recently arrived in London, and the UK's newly appointed ambassador to China, Sir Ralph Stevenson, has followed Sir Seymour to take office in China. He passed through Shanghai yesterday on his way to Beijing, and will soon be going to Guling to present his credentials to President Chiang. A new page in Sino-British relations is about to unfold.</p>
<p>At this time when the Far Eastern situation is in dire need of clarification, we cannot help but place deep expectations on Ambassador Stevenson's arrival in China. Not only does Sir Stevenson have a special knowledge and understanding of Far Eastern issues, but he is also an experienced diplomat. The British government's appointment of such an outstanding figure to handle diplomatic affairs between China and Britain in the complex and complicated Far East is, of course, more than appropriate.</p>
<p>Needless to say, in the diplomatic history of China and Britain, there are indeed some points that are unbearable to look back on. In the past, the corruption of the Manchu Qing government and the imperialist policies taken by foreign countries should be held responsible for these points. However, since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, Britain has gradually changed its policies over the past two decades, and after the Great War, China and Britain were on the same side of the enemy, becoming friends in adversity. The friendship between the two countries is bound to be consolidated after this test. During the Great War, China and Britain were in almost the same position. China was fighting alone in the Far East, fighting a desperate battle with the Japanese invaders. After the surrender of France, Britain became the lone army in Europe, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Churchill, it was persevering and unyielding, and finally turned the entire war situation from danger to safety. Therefore, China and Britain have suffered the greatest losses in this war, but they have also made special contributions to victory. China can fully understand Britain, and Britain will fully understand China. At the Chinese National Flag Day held in London this May, British celebrities and scholars gave speeches, praising China's hard resistance and great contribution to victory. Even after the end of the war, the situation in China and Britain is still quite similar. Everyone needs "stability" and everyone needs "prosperity". Although Britain is unable to actively assist China's revival in material terms after the war, the British government and public alike hope that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country, and their enthusiasm is no less than that of any allied country. As Ambassador Stevenson said in London after being appointed: "Britain has no other ambitions in China than commerce, and is eager for China to become a strong, stable, and unified country, so that it can assume important tasks in maintaining the effective tools of world peace (ie, the United Nations). The British government will do its utmost to assist China within the greatest possible scope, so that China can become a strong and unified country." This is what Britain hopes of China; and this is what China hopes Britain will assist it in.</p>
<p>It can be seen from this that, due to the changes in the international situation after the war, Britain's China policy has also shifted from politics to economics. In order to promote trade with China, Britain plans to send a delegation to China to conduct on-the-spot investigations of commercial conditions. Even former Foreign Secretary Eden expressed his willingness to visit China, and delivered a speech at the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Britain has deep sympathy for China. China was the first country to rise up against aggression, and we cannot forget it, nor will we ever forget it; China resisted Japanese aggression for longer than Britain resisted aggression. At present, international trade is fraught with difficulties due to the turbulence and unrest of the situation. Hesitation and obstruction can be seen everywhere; but these obstacles are not unavoidable. I also strongly agree with the British government's dispatch of a business delegation to China, which is the most appropriate measure to promote trade between the two countries." Eden can be said to be a true friend of China. Ambassador Stevenson once served as the Chief Secretary to Foreign Secretary Eden, and must have a common understanding of his views, and intends to find ways to promote their realization. At present, some people in British financial circles, due to a lack of knowledge, do not understand China's national conditions very well, and express pessimism about the prospects of China's revival and nation-building; but enlightened people, especially the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce, have the clearest understanding and are completely optimistic, and firmly advocate promoting trade between the two countries. For example, Panks, the president of the association, said: "Britain should do its best to establish economic ties with China, and should work hard to promote trade between the two countries even during the difficult transition period." In the past few days, the British House of Commons is also going to discuss Sino-British business relations. We sincerely hope that the British government can decide on a trade policy with China as soon as possible, especially how to use capital and technology to assist China's industrial development.</p>
<p>The British Labour Party has been in power for nearly a year since succeeding the Conservative Party, and has adopted a more enlightened policy in both its domestic and foreign affairs. Especially in diplomacy, the enlightened measures of the Labour government are worthy of our admiration. Prime Minister Attlee not only allowed India to become independent, but also announced that British troops would withdraw from Egypt, which has won worldwide acclaim. Therefore, we do not believe that the British Labour government will ignore the unresolved Hong Kong issue. Because the three giants, Luo, Qiu, and Jiang, had already decided at the Cairo Conference that Hong Kong should be returned to China, there is absolutely no problem in principle; moreover, Hong Kong is still under British rule, it will no longer be a gem on the British crown, but has become a layer of separation in Sino-British friendship. Therefore, we believe that once the time is ripe, the Hong Kong issue can be negotiated and resolved reasonably. Ambassador Stevenson also expressed this view when he arrived in Singapore. Britain is the birthplace of democratic politics, and today's politics are also most in line with democratic principles; all the measures taken by the government in domestic affairs are based on public opinion, and the government will also pay special attention to international justice and the national aspirations of other countries. Therefore, as Ambassador Stevenson takes office in China, we would like to specifically mention that: Please have Britain return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, which is the national aspiration unanimously demanded by our country. Ambassador Stevenson must be able to see clearly that only after this blemish is removed can the history of Sino-British relations have a truly new page.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Sudden Rise in Old Yellow River Waters in Xuzhou; Flood Prevention Team Delineates Areas for Emergency Blocking <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Correspondent] Due to continuous rainy weather, the water level of the Old Yellow River in our city began to rise sharply from 8:00 PM on the 24th. The water level continued to rise throughout the night, and by the morning of the following day, the area outside the city moat at the Fourth Inspection Station was completely submerged. The water was surging powerfully, threatening to breach the moat and flood into the city. The Municipal Government's Bureau of Public Works and the Police Bureau, together with the District Office, dispatched personnel to investigate and mobilized laborers to take emergency measures to prevent any untoward incidents. Unexpectedly, at 12:30 PM, before the mobilized laborers could arrive, the river water had already breached the moat and flooded into the Old Yellow River embankment area within the city. The water flow was rapid, and the water level rose sharply. In particular, the area west of Zemin Bridge was in danger of flooding into the city streets at any moment. Fortunately, the 88th Engineering Corps and civilian laborers arrived and bravely fought to reinforce the embankments, ensuring no further breaches occurred. To strengthen protection, the Municipal Government convened a meeting of the heads of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the Police Bureau, and other relevant units to discuss flood prevention and blocking measures. It was decided to establish a flood prevention team, with Police Chief Zhu Gongyan as the team leader, and Bureau of Public Works Director Zheng and the First and Tenth District Chiefs as his deputies, responsible for flood prevention and blocking. The Old Yellow River in the urban area was divided into four flood prevention zones: (1) the area west of Qingyun Bridge, (2) Qingyun Bridge to Jizhong Bridge, (3) Jizhong Bridge to Liji Bridge, and (4) the area south of Liji Bridge. The simple houses made of wooden planks and reed mats that were usually built on the riverbanks of the Old Yellow River were submerged by the evening of the 26th, with only the rooftops occasionally visible. This left 400 impoverished families homeless. By night, the water level had risen more than eight feet above normal.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Various Counties in Northern Anhui Disaster Area Actively Eradicate Locusts <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Bengbu Correspondent] Since the beginning of summer, locusts in various counties in northern Anhui have been breeding rapidly, devouring crops and causing widespread damage. The Locust Control Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Anhui, together with the Locust Control Task Force of the Anhui Relief Sub-Bureau, has been promoting locust control efforts. They have mobilized farmers in counties such as ____, Mingguang, Jiashan, and Fengyang to actively control locusts, with the assistance of relevant authorities, resulting in significant effectiveness. It is now reported that the Locust Control Task Force has moved north along the Jinpu Railway, with its headquarters set up in Bengbu. The Supervisory Office will also move here, planning to use the "work-for-relief" method to encourage the public to actively control locusts, increasing the standard for flour distribution. Locust control drugs and bait materials have been rationally allocated, with Fengyang, Dingyuan, Suxian, Hefei, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and other counties designated as pilot areas. It is expected that after the deployment of technical personnel and the use of control methods, locusts will be significantly reduced.</p>

<p>Village Head Arrested and Imprisoned for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Cai Jichen (also known as Bao____), the director of the Sanxu Office in the First District of Nantong and concurrently the village head of Yuanzhong Village, extorted large sums of money from the public during his tenure, leaving behind a trail of misdeeds. The public harbored deep resentment and secretly filed a complaint with the Fourth District Commissioner's Office. After a thorough investigation, the Commissioner's Office summoned Cai Jichen on the 25th. Commissioner Xu personally presided over the trial, where Cai Jichen confessed to his crimes. Commissioner Xu, considering that the village head was a self-governance official, not only reprimanded him in court but also ordered his immediate arrest and imprisonment as a warning to other corrupt officials.</p>

<p>Request to Waive Land Tax and Replace it with Legal Tender</p>
<p>Fuyang's grain production has always been insufficient to meet its own needs, requiring the purchase of grain from elsewhere. This year, due to the low prices of the county's specialty products, paper and tea, the economy is struggling, making it difficult to collect grain to meet the land tax. It is now reported that the Chairman of the County Council, Hua Yiren, and the Vice-Chairman, Li ____'an, along with councilors Hong Daonan and others, have come to the provincial capital to join eleven councilors in Hangzhou, including Wang Shaogong, to petition the provincial government to waive the collection of accumulated grain as tax and replace it with legal tender.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Who Conducted the Security and Population Check?</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the security of the urban area, the City Defense Command convened a temporary emergency security meeting on the night of the 25th. The heads of all police stations in the urban area and representatives from the self-defense teams attended. Several important cases were discussed and resolved. Hu Yongyan, the head of the Security and Inspection ____, together with the Police Bureau and the self-defense teams of ____ Gong, Siqian, Dongcang, ____ Le, and Anjing towns, conducted a thorough overnight population check.

<p>Village Head Accused of Extorting Money and Charged with Duty Neglect</p>
<p>Chen Heng____, the village head of Xiadian Village in Dongting District, the deputy village head Chen Jicun, assistants Chen Zu____, and Yang ____ ____, colluded to collect a registration fee of 200 yuan from each household under the guise of issuing citizen oath certificates on the 9th of this month. They threatened to withhold the certificates if the fee was not paid. The villagers, unaware of the underlying situation, paid the fees, totaling over 500,000 yuan. All of this money was divided and used privately. Afterwards, villagers learned that there was no such regulation and that other villages did not pay this fee, clearly indicating extortion. It has been discovered that the village head, deputy village head, and assistants had repeatedly held positions under the puppet regime, oppressing the people and committing numerous evil deeds. Now, they have transformed themselves and are once again holding official positions. The entire citizenry of the village has specially dispatched representatives, including Zhang Wenyi, to the city court to file a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, requesting their arrest and legal prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Plenary Session of the Peace Conference Held Yesterday Afternoon; Byrnes Delivers Speech; Procedural Committee Decides to Allow Journalists to Observe; Review of Credentials May Encounter Considerable Difficulties <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, 30th Broadcast: The Rules of Procedure Committee, which is tasked with deciding the methods for the Peace Conference, held its first meeting today. Contrary to general expectations, it did not take action on the issue of passing resolutions by a majority or two-thirds vote, which is considered a contentious issue. However, another important resolution was passed: Byrnes proposed that when the Peace Conference discusses treaties with Italy, Romania, and other countries, journalists should be allowed to attend publicly. This proposal was supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Australian representative Evatt and was subsequently approved. Belgian representative Hynbaert was elected Chairman of the committee, and Yugoslav representative Benderjer was elected Vice-Chairman.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] When the Paris Peace Conference convenes at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time), US Secretary of State Byrnes will be the first to speak. The Procedural Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM, which Byrnes also attended as the US representative. Byrnes will reiterate his previous remarks, advocating that both the plenary session and special committees should allow journalists to observe. The Procedural Committee will decide on this matter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] Regarding the review of the credentials of the 21 European countries attending the Peace Conference, well-informed sources here say that this issue may cause some difficulties this afternoon. The Allied delegations have included the foreign ministers of the Baltic states as representatives to attend the Peace Conference. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have never recognized the incorporation of these small countries into the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British and American representatives may question whether the foreign ministers of the Baltic states can effectively serve as representatives of the Soviet Union. According to previous conferences, each country is limited to five plenipotentiary representatives. It is rumored that the Soviet representatives may request an increase in the number of representatives, and it is believed that this request may encounter opposition from some representatives.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 29th] The official announcement states that the Italian delegation to the Peace Conference will be led by Prime Minister Gasperi, with members including President of the Constituent Assembly Saragat, former Prime Minister Bonomi, and the Italian ambassadors to the United Kingdom, the United States, Poland, and Brazil, as well as several experts.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] It is reported that the Iranian Ambassador to France, Raikhmanei, recently sent a note to the four major powers requesting to participate in the Peace Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Key Points of the Draft Treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, and Romania <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Hungarian Treaty</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] Washington Broadcast, Paris Report: The four major powers have agreed to stipulate in the treaty with Hungary that Hungary should pay reparations of $300 million. However, the United States reserves the right to oppose imposing such a burden on the former Axis satellite state, which is experiencing extreme currency inflation. Regarding military matters, the treaty with Hungary stipulates that Hungary's standing army should be reduced to one-tenth of its pre-war size, not exceeding 70,000 personnel, with an air force quota not exceeding 5,000 personnel and a maximum of 90 aircraft. The treaty also stipulates that the Soviet Union may retain "the necessary number of troops" in Hungary to ensure transportation routes to the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. Other Allied troops will be completely withdrawn within 90 days after the formal signing of the treaty. As for the border lines, they will remain as they were before the war, with half of Outer Transylvania returned to Romania.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Treaty</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] Washington Broadcast, Paris Report: In the draft treaty with Bulgaria prepared by the four major powers, the issues of the Bulgarian-Greek border and the amount of reparations Bulgaria owes to Greece and Yugoslavia remain unresolved. Regarding the border issue, the four powers believe that both Bulgaria and Greece can present their different opinions to the Peace Conference for further decision. After the First World War, Bulgaria was forced to cede the Thrace region to Greece. During this war, when German troops entered Bulgaria, they "took back" this region from Greece and returned it to Bulgaria. Bulgaria declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on December 13, 1941, but remained neutral during the German-Soviet war. However, the Soviet Union did not recognize its neutrality and still declared war on Bulgaria. The treaty also stipulates that Bulgaria's army will be limited to 55,000 personnel, the navy to 3,500 personnel, ships to 7,520 tons, and aircraft to 90.</p>
<p>Finnish Treaty</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, 30th Broadcast: In the draft treaty with Finland prepared by the four major powers, it is proposed to limit the size of the Finnish army to no more than 34,400 personnel. Finland's naval personnel should not exceed 4,500, the total tonnage of ships should not exceed 10,000 tons, and the army and navy aircraft should not exceed 60, and new types of aircraft are not allowed to be acquired. Finland should lease Porkkala to the Soviet Union for 50 years, where the latter can establish a naval base. In addition, Finland should cede the northwestern part of the Beluk province to the Soviet Union. As for Finland's reparations to the Soviet Union, they should be limited to $300 million, to be paid off in eight years from September 1, 1955, with payments made in goods, including timber, river vessels, and machinery.</p>
<p>Romanian Treaty [Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The full text of the draft peace treaty with Romania, prepared by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, was distributed to the representatives of the 21 countries yesterday. The original text was released tonight at 11:00 PM. Its main points are as follows: (1) The border between Romania and Hungary should be restored to its original state as of January 1, 1938. All border changes after that date are invalid. (2) Romania should release all political prisoners who sympathize with the United Nations' cause, disband all fascist organizations, and eliminate all anti-Soviet and anti-United Nations propaganda agencies. (3) Arrest all war criminals and criminals who endanger peace or humanity. (4) Land, sea, and air force armaments are limited to those necessary for protecting domestic security, and excess personnel should be demobilized within six months after the treaty comes into effect. (5) The remaining materials should be handed over to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Military Armaments Subject to Strict Restrictions</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] According to the draft treaty with Italy, Italy's once-proud war machine will be reduced to almost theater-level performance, and Mussolini's empire, which once aspired to rival Caesar's Roman Empire, will be reduced to a long boot-shaped region. In addition, there are various penalties for Italy's reckless wars, such as reparations of $100 million to the Soviet Union, which have been agreed upon by the four powers. However, other disputed issues, such as the boundaries of the Trieste Free Territory and the amount of reparations to France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and other countries damaged by US participation in the war, have not yet been agreed upon.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French Postal and Telegraph Workers' Union, demanding a pay raise, called on all postal, telegraph, and telephone workers to strike for ten hours from 3:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 30th to support their demands.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] At today's meeting of the War-Torn Areas Reconstruction Committee, the Chinese representative declared on the spot that no less than 186 million Chinese people had been under the enemy's iron heel, and the losses caused by the enemy's plunder and destruction were estimated at approximately 1.3 trillion US dollars. This shows the urgency and breadth of China's need for reconstruction. The assistance needed by war-torn countries should not be considered charity but rather economic unity. The French representative, who is the chairman of the committee, Pagana, said that France values coal more than diamonds. France has only one desire, which is to accelerate recovery and participate in the world's reconstruction efforts.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] The US State Department announced today that it has received a note from the British government stating that it principally accepts Byrnes' proposal to economically unify the German occupation zones with the US occupation zone. The State Department welcomes this expression from the British side, believing that this is the first step to relieve the significant financial burden on the British and American occupation countries and the economic downturn in the British and American occupation zones, as the German economy has lost its interdependence since Germany was divided into four autonomous zones. The State Department hopes that other occupation countries will also respond to Byrnes' proposal in the same way. "The US government believes that all countries will benefit greatly if they can promote Germany's economic integration in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement." A State Department spokesman also said that the Allies have begun discussing the issue of German economic unification in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Moscow Radio reported that Pravda said that the US plan to merge the economies of the German occupation zones is intended to be anti-Soviet. It also said that the Soviet Union believes that the prerequisites for unifying Germany are to implement the Potsdam Declaration, eliminate Nazi forces, and disarm Germany militarily and economically.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Situation on the Opening Day of the Peace Conference <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The European Peace Conference of 21 countries held its first meeting at 3:03 PM this afternoon (Greenwich Mean Time, 30th at 0:03 AM Shanghai time) in the Luxembourg Palace, and adjourned at 4:23 PM. The atmosphere in the meeting was solemn and ____, rarely seen in previous international conferences. Half an hour before the opening, representatives from various countries arrived together. Representatives from some countries were wearing their national uniforms, forming groups of twos and threes. There were also several women among them. There were many journalists. At 3:00 PM sharp, the heads of delegations from various countries were led into the venue by US Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The Paris Peace Conference opened today. French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a welcoming speech first (see separate cable for the text), and then announced the start of the conference. US representative Byrnes then proposed that Bidault be the temporary chairman of the conference and Dibac be the secretary-general, and that Bidault's term be approved unanimously by the conference. After Bidault took the chair, he proposed that UN Secretary-General Lie be invited to attend the Peace Conference as a guest and observer of the United Nations organization. He then proposed China, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, the Netherlands and other seven countries as members of the Credentials Review Committee, which was passed. It was also decided that the committee should meet one hour before the meeting tomorrow. At this point, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stepped onto the podium and expressed the hope that the Procedural Committee would not only be a procedural committee in the ordinary sense but also determine the organization of the conference, which is extremely important. For example, how many votes the Foreign Ministers' recommendations should get should be passed by the committee. The Australian government believes that procedural issues are related to the status of the conference itself. Mr. Evatt continued to urge the chairman of the conference to convene the committee immediately, because the principle issues related to the status of the 17 participating countries also need to be discussed by the committee. According to the Moscow Declaration of last December, the Procedural Committee can decide what the true authority of this conference is for the final treaty, and the 17 countries should have equal power with the Foreign Ministers' meeting to decide the final treaty. This point must be clarified. We should decide whether this conference adopts a simple majority system or a special majority system. Pichell then suggested that the Procedural Committee should meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow. As chairman, he sincerely hoped to satisfy the wishes of the various delegations. Tomorrow's conference will start at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, starting with general discussions, and the Credentials Review Committee will meet one hour earlier. There was no objection in the conference venue, and the adjournment was announced.</p>
<p>Key Points of Bidault's Speech</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault recently delivered a welcoming speech at the closing of the European Peace Conference, saying: "I represent the people and government of France in welcoming representatives of the United Nations and friendly countries to Paris to hold the first large-scale international conference to discuss and resolve various post-war issues. I believe that the representatives of all countries will be able to work together in a spirit of friendship and cooperation to address the important tasks they face. After the First World War, the main reason for the failure of the peace conference held in Paris was that the two major powers, although decisive in the war, remained aloof when making peace. But now these phenomena no longer exist, and all democratic countries are now participating in the discussion. Because of the common ideals of all countries in the world for peace, the United Nations organization was born, and the foreign ministers of various countries have been engaged in various preparatory work in London and Paris. There have been complaints about the conference procedures and its repeated postponements. In fact, the difficulties we have encountered are very significant because the interests represented by all parties are not easy to compromise, and some principles necessary for international policy must be observed. Speaking of the tasks undertaken by the representatives of various countries attending the conference, the issues raised to you are only a part of peacemaking, which are extremely difficult and extremely complex and have a significant impact on the interests of European countries. However, I firmly believe that our joint discussions on this matter will find a solution, even if it is not perfect, but at least it is a reasonable way that does not deviate from justice and glory."</p>

<h3 id="e43">Continued Trial of Japanese Invasion of China: International Tribunal Hears Testimony Yesterday <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 30th] The Far East International Tribunal today first heard witness Lawrence continue to describe how the Japanese poisoned the Chinese people in North China, stating that after the Japanese army occupied Beiping, opium and morphine were openly sold. Most of these drugs were transported into the city by Japanese army trucks. The defense did not cross-examine Lawrence's testimony. The testimony of witnesses summoned since June 12th has now concluded, as have the four days of testimony regarding the Nanjing Massacre. The defendants' defense team remained completely silent regarding this horrific and bloody event. Prosecutor Sa Tung thoroughly pursued the atrocities of the Japanese army, especially exposing the brutal treatment of women by the Japanese army. The number of Japanese women attending the hearings is increasing daily, which is a notable characteristic in recent days. The court continued to hear the case of the Japanese invasion of Northeast and North China. The prosecution presented Chinese government documents (the establishment process of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council), the Japan Yearbook's description of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and the Hebei Political Council, Ambassador Ariyoshi's May 1936 report to Foreign Minister Arita regarding Inner Mongolia policy, and Chinese diplomatic documents describing illegal flights of Japanese aircraft in North China. Ariyoshi's secret telegram to Arita stated: "According to military reports, the work in Inner Mongolia has recently made considerable progress. From April 21st to 26th, Prince De, Li Shouxin, Wu Heling, and the head of the Tanaka Special Agency held a so-called nation-building conference, resolving to build Qinghai and Mongolia into one country and conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the puppet Manchukuo, with Prince Yun as chairman, and Princes Suo and Sha as vice-chairmen, and Prince De as commander-in-chief, etc." The prosecution also presented the "Essentials for Handling North China" decided by the Japanese government in 1937, which stated that the means to handle North China were to make North China a communist prevention zone, while seizing resources, securing transportation, to defend against the Soviet Union, and to form a "cooperation" between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." To achieve this goal, the main effort should be focused on economic work targeting the people of North China and to make the central government assist in this policy.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 30th] This agency exclusively reports today that former US Secretary of State Hull and Zhou Enlai may be invited to testify at the Far East International Tribunal. At the same time, rumors say that the Japanese defense team wants to summon US Senator Brewster and Congressman Gearhart to Japan to testify. One of them signed the minority report of the Pearl Harbor Investigative Committee, accusing the late President Roosevelt and Hull of guilt for the cause of the incident. It is generally expected that Hull will be questioned about foreign policy before December 7, 1941, and Zhou Enlai may support the defendant's argument, saying that the division within China during the Northeast Incident allowed Japan to use local governments as targets, unwilling to engage with the central government.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Britain, Xueyan</p>
<p>[London Correspondence, July 2nd] At midnight on June 28th, British forces in Palestine suddenly declared martial law in major cities, prohibiting traffic. Under this martial law, they searched the headquarters of the Jewish Agency and its branches in various locations, arresting executive members of the Jewish Agency and searching for illegal arms of the Haganah, the security force organized by the Jewish Agency. In addition, over two thousand suspected Jews were detained for interrogation. This event, from its launch to the date of this reporter's writing, has lasted four days, but the tense situation in Palestine has not eased slightly. The reactions from various parties, especially the United States, are also not clear, seemingly waiting for the continued development of the situation. Its seriousness is very obvious.</p>
<p>The decision for this action came from the British Cabinet. The American authorities were notified in advance, but their opinions were not sought. British Prime Minister Attlee made a special statement in the House of Commons yesterday (July 1st) afternoon, explaining the motives and determination of the British government in taking this action. The general idea was: The British authorities in Palestine have obtained conclusive evidence that the recent terrorist actions in Palestine were supported in an organized manner by the Haganah and some leaders of the Jewish Agency. The British government took this decisive measure to maintain law and order, aiming to eliminate the root of terrorism, and not to antagonize the entire Jewish community in Palestine. It is hoped that law-abiding Jews will continue to cooperate with the authorities so that local order can be restored as soon as possible. The American authorities were notified before taking action, but their opinions were not sought, because maintaining law and order is a responsibility that Britain shouldered under the mandate, and there is no need to seek the consent of other countries. As for the recommendations of the Anglo-American investigation team, experts from both countries are still discussing the details. After Attlee's statement was released, Members of Parliament questioned him harshly, demanding that the government publish evidence of the Jewish Agency's support for terrorists. The government stated that the publication of evidence must wait because the action is still ongoing. According to this reporter's observation, the reason why the terrorist actions in Palestine have lasted so long is undoubtedly due to the protection and assistance provided by the Jewish Agency. The British action of attacking the headquarters of the Jewish Agency and its affiliated armed forces, the Haganah, with lightning speed, was motivated by the desire to eliminate the root causes of terrorist actions in one fell swoop. But the question is, what will be the effectiveness? According to the broadcast of the Jewish secret radio station in Palestine (which has not yet been cracked), they will take retaliatory actions. According to the leaders of the Jewish Agency who have not been arrested, Jews cannot cooperate with the authorities while some executive committee members are still detained. Therefore, the tense situation in Palestine is unlikely to ease in the short term, and the hope of ending terrorist actions is even more remote, and may even cause more violent new terrorist actions. This of course awaits the development of the situation, and we do not want to make predictions. However, in any case, this is a new turning point in the evolution of the Palestine dispute, making it even more difficult for Britain to compromise with the Jews in the future, which is undoubtedly true. Therefore, we may as well analyze the significance of this action a little more. We know that the current situation in Palestine is the result of the First World War, which was assigned to Britain by the League of Nations under mandate. When the British army had already occupied this land, and the intention of the Jews had been decided, Britain issued the so-called</p>
<p>Balfour Declaration</p>
<p>saying that the British government wanted to "prepare a national home" for the Jews in Palestine, but without prejudice to the inherent welfare of the local Arabs and the Jews scattered around the world. The purpose of this declaration was to win the sympathy of the world so that Britain could continue to manage this land, and it later got its wish. The Balfour Declaration was also recognized and adopted by the San Remo Conference in 1920 and the mandate agreement in 1923, and became the legal policy for Britain to govern this land. The mass immigration of Jews can be said to have started at this time, especially in recent years, as a result of the expulsion of Jews from all over the world, even more Jews have immigrated. At present, Palestine has about 1.2 million Arabs and about 600,000 Jews. However, because the Jews have more financial and intellectual resources than the Arabs, it is inevitable that the Jews will win in the competition between the two sides. The friction between the two sides has become increasingly acute due to the increasing number of Jews immigrating. The British authorities vacillated between the two sides, sometimes favoring the Jews and sometimes favoring the Arabs, depending on the general situation and British interests. Recently, due to the development of Arab national consciousness and the strengthening of mutual unity, the resistance to the continued immigration of Jews to Palestine has gradually intensified. In view of this, Britain has restricted the annual number of Jewish immigrants since 1939 and restricted the Jews who have already immigrated from purchasing land in certain areas. In this way, although the resistance of the Arabs has become silent, the resistance of the Jews has risen one after another, and the dispute has never been quiet. Last November, British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced the organization of</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Song Tingjun, Chief of the Taishan Police Station Branch, received a tip-off the night before last that someone was selling large quantities of drugs, and immediately began investigating. That night, he went with Deputy Chief Li, Section Chief Zhang, and others to the home of Zhu Guangming (30 years old, from Shandong) at No. 5, Lane 279, Ninghai East Road, and found multiple bags of morphine raw materials in the middle of flour sacks. He took Zhu to the station for questioning. According to his confession, the morphine belonged to his friend Li Shisen (43 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 53, Hongrui Lane, Xinwen Road), who and Li had worked together as morphine engineers. He then took the suspect to Li's address and arrested him. According to Li's confession, he had indeed worked as an engineer, and said that there were accomplices who often visited the Dieji and Jindi salted meat shops on Taoyuan Road to solicit prostitutes. Officers were dispatched to arrest them but were unsuccessful. Li also confessed that No. 659, at the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road, was a major drug den. Chief Song personally led Section Chief Zhang and officers Zhang Jiabao, Yang Xinzhong, Police Chief Huang Peiting, Yu Yan, plainclothes police Xu Xuebo, Deng Kexiang, Gao Wenrong, Hao Wende, Xu Yushi, Wu Youkai, Xie Jianqing, Liu Dengdi, Yang Jinhong and others to the above-mentioned location overnight. They saw a sign for the Da Zhong Coal Ball Factory hanging at the entrance. Inside was set up the Guangming Chemical Industry Company. They found two people boiling raw materials downstairs. Upon reaching the second floor, they saw two people packing bags. They immediately arrested foreman Li Junan (34 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 18, Baoshan Road), Wang Jingui (41 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 161, Yangzhou Road), Wang Zhangdong (50 years old, from Jinhua, residing at No. 223, Changping Road), and Guo Xingquan (26 years old, from Suzhou, who had been in the gauze belt business and residing at No. 12, Minguo Lane, Minguo Road). It was learned that the above four people were all drug manufacturing engineers. Subsequently, the landlord and accountant of both the Da Zhong and Guangming companies, Lin Chuntao (29 years old, local), was arrested. It was learned that he was one of the drug manufacturing shareholders. Another suspect, Zhang Anfa, was an employee of the Guangming Chemical Industry Company (41 years old, from Ningbo). According to Li Junan's confession, the boss was Cai Yangen (37 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 18, Jincheng Villa, Jing'an Temple Road). Li was taken there, and in addition to arresting the suspect Zhu, they found a privately owned pistol with a license and confiscated a bag of heroin. According to Zhu's confession, they arrested shareholder Zhu Chunyuan (36 years old, from Hubei, engaged in the silk business) at No. 25, Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road. The above ten people were all principal offenders. They went to various places and arrested more than 20 male and female accomplices one after another, and all were taken to the station, where Chief Song, together with Section Chief Zhang, conducted separate and thorough interrogations. In the drug den on Daxi Road, a total of six large boxes of drugs were found (one of which was unfinished), each box weighing over 30 taels (with lime underneath), as well as machinery, raw materials, and four boxes of kerosene, five large glass bottles, sixteen large foreign bottles, a roll of cotton, a porcelain cylinder, a grinding cylinder, two lead buckets, two lead pots, one hemp bag of pure alkali, another rush bag, measuring scales and other items, two washbasins, a large charcoal brazier, and a funnel, all of which were taken back to the branch for filing. The confiscated drugs are estimated to be worth over 300 million yuan. The capital of the drug den was huge, the scale was grand, and it was rarely seen in recent years. It is reported that there are still several principal and accessory offenders at large, and the branch is pursuing them.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] These past few days, we have been experiencing spring tides. At midnight yesterday, in the area of the Bund on Linsen Road, the Huangpu River flooded the road. Standing nearby, one could only see a vast expanse of water, unable to distinguish the shore from the river. The French Consulate seemed to be built in the ocean. The Daming Road area was also flooded, especially the area east of Yuanfang Road and west of Tilanqiao. The wharves floated on the river, higher than the land. The small boats parked on the beach seemed to be parked on the road. In the low-lying areas of the city, the tide poured back into the sewers, just like a flood!</p>
<p>According to the Junpu Bureau report: Yesterday's tide reached 14 feet 8 inches, so the river flooding was inevitable. Because the terrain of Shanghai is relatively low, and with the help of the northeast wind, the tide surged towards Shanghai.</p>
<p>Usually June-July to August-September is the spring tide season of the year (lunar calendar), so this year's spring tide will not pass for a while. The phenomenon of low-lying areas being flooded will continue for a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The workers of the machine manufacturing factory of the American-owned Shenchang Foreign Firm submitted a request to the employer a month ago to adjust their wages and adopt the cost of living index for salary payment. The employer believes that the cost of manufactured products is higher than that of imported products, and that there have been huge losses for several months. They are willing to close down part of the manufacturing factory, otherwise, they will have to reduce wages to reduce the cost of manufactured products to maintain operations. The labor side felt that their demands were not met and that there was a risk of unemployment, so they traveled around appealing for support. This reporter visited Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the factory is indeed suffering huge losses. Mayor Wu is now working hard to resolve this dispute, on the one hand persuading the employer to abandon the proposal to close down, and on the other hand persuading the labor side to make some concessions on wages. It is also heard that Mayor Wu will personally go to the Shenchang Factory on Yangshupu Road at 3:00 PM today to give instructions to all the workers in order to break the deadlock that has lasted for a month.</p>

<h3 id="e56">He DeKui States "Busy with Official Duties"; No Time to "Argue" with Luo Heng; Mayor Wu Remains Silent on the He Case <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After Luo Heng, a councilor who came to Shanghai a few days ago, published a conversation in the newspaper exposing He DeKui, reporters from this city rushed to the City Hall to interview Secretary-General He yesterday. He did not give a definitive answer to the reporters' questions. According to people in the Secretary-General's office, He is waiting for a thorough investigation and has no intention of resigning at present. His trip to Beijing a few days ago was at the call of President Song. The photographic evidence presented by Luo Heng is indeed true, but the situation at the time was chaotic and the environment was bad. He's signed letter to the Bureau of Education of the Public Concession was intended to allow the puppet education committee to contact the Bureau of Education and fill out the forms issued by the puppet government to avoid trouble with the authorities of the Public Concession. Moreover, the sphere of influence of the Bureau of Education of the Public Concession was the schools of the Public Concession, not the schools of the entire city. The letter did not contain any instructions to change to puppet textbooks, and puppet textbooks had not yet been printed at that time. People around He also said that when He took office as Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, he was summoned to meet with Chairman Chiang, and he immediately expressed that he had worked in the Public Concession under foreign rule for many years. Once he took office as Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, he might not be able to meet the expectations of the public. The chairman encouraged him to work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>According to Da Guang News Agency: It is heard that before He went to Beijing last Saturday to see President Song, he went to see Chiang Bocheng, who stayed in Shanghai during the War of Resistance to preside over underground work, asking him to send a telegram to the chairman to prove that he was protecting underground workers. Therefore, it is generally speculated that He's trips to Beijing and Shanghai were to find strong counter-evidence. Luo Heng, the councilor who first exposed He, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, met with reporters, and published the motives and process of the exposure, citing two strong pieces of evidence: (1) Promoting enslavement education, (2) Monitoring the activities of teachers, and refuting He's previous statement that he did not leave because the British and Americans in the Public Concession all stayed in their posts after the outbreak of the Pacific War, saying that He had probably forgotten which country he himself belonged to. Reporters from various newspapers visited He at the City Hall yesterday, asking for his opinion on Luo's remarks. He replied: "Facts speak louder than words. I have a clear conscience. I will continue to work as usual and wait for the government to send someone to investigate thoroughly. The truth will come out in the future." At this point, He suddenly left his seat, seemingly impatient to talk more, and then lingered in front of the long table where the reporters were sitting, talking about his trip to Beijing, saying that he had not been to the capital for more than ten years. In Beijing, in addition to visiting President Song, he also went to Zijin Mountain to pay homage to the mausoleum and admire the remains of the Founding Father, respectfully presenting wreaths to express his respect. Finally, he said that he was busy with official duties and really had no time to "argue" with Ms. Luo Heng.</p>
<p>A Datong News Agency reporter asked Mayor Wu yesterday whether He's written reply to the accusations of being a traitor after Secretary-General He was accused of being a traitor had been forwarded to the central government. Mayor Wu replied that it had already been forwarded to the Executive Yuan and stated that He's case was completely a ordinary judicial case and he did not want to respond to it, because Secretary-General He served in the City Hall before him. This incident was a past event, and Secretary-General He is an incumbent administrative official. To date, there has been no one who has made a formal or anonymous accusation, so he would not express his opinion until he received an order from the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Coal Ball King: Shen Jinzhou's Public Trial. Differing Views among Peers, Joint Accusations of Collaborating with the Enemy, While Others Guarantee Innocence. Roughly One Hundred Firms on Each Side, Showing Equally Strong Support. The Defendant Claims to Have Received a Letter of Thanks from Former Mayor Qian Dajun. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Shanghai's largest coal merchant, Yi Tai Xing Coal Company Limited, was tried yesterday afternoon at the High Court on suspicion of being a traitor. Shen, who is 60 years old and a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, is known in Shanghai as the "Coal Ball King." After the victory, he was jointly accused by over a hundred coal merchants in the city on three counts: (1) Yi Tai Xing Coal Company was originally a shareholder of the Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine Railway Company Limited. In November of the 26th year (1937), Shen colluded with Zhu Yicai, the chairman of the company, to sell all the mineral rights, mineral products, railways, and other assets of the Liujiang Coal Mine area in Linjian County, Hebei Province, to the enemy merchant Mitsui &amp; Co. at a huge price. (2) After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of Shanghai's coal fell entirely into the hands of the enemy. All coal was managed and operated under the control of the Coal Association organized by Japanese companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yamashita, and Kailuan. Shen, along with sixteen other merchants including Da Chang, raised funds to organize the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company. Shen was elected as chairman and requested to purchase coal from the Coal Association, implementing the enemy's control policies on their behalf, seeking exorbitant profits, and harming the people's livelihood. In the 33rd year (1944), the coal company was reorganized into the Da Zhong Lian Coal Rationing Office, and Shen was again elected as a standing director. (3) From January of the 34th year (1945), due to the enemy's defeat in the Pacific War and the lack of shipping, Da Zhong Lian used civilian ships to transport coal from Qingdao to Shanghai, half of which was supplied to the enemy army and half of which was sold on the market for profit. Following this accusation, the High Prosecutor's Office detained Shen, and after the investigation was completed, formally filed a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Shen appeared yesterday wearing white silk shirt and trousers, covered with a long blue-gray silk robe, a flat-topped hat, black shoes, and a white folding fan in his hand. He spoke in pure local dialect, answering that after the "September 18th Incident," the Liujiang Mine was occupied by enemy forces. Zhu Yicai had repeatedly negotiated without result, until ten years later, when the shareholders' meeting resolved to authorize the board of directors to negotiate with the enemy. However, the enemy refused to return the mine and only agreed to pay a price of 600,000 yuan. Regarding the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, it was not an enemy puppet organization or group, but a partnership funded by private individuals, and had nothing to do with the Japanese. Furthermore, he had repeatedly declined the position of chairman. After the reorganization into the Rationing Office in the 33rd year (1944), he never attended meetings. Therefore, regarding the third accusation of transporting coal to Qingdao, he had resigned and knew nothing about it. After the victory, he was entrusted by Zhao Zengyu, the director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, to take over the "Coal Association," obtaining more than 50,000 tons of coal for the city's power company. He claimed that a letter of thanks from Mayor Qian Dajun could prove this. The court then summoned the accusers, Tong Zixin and Luo Xinqing, who stated that they were in the same industry as the defendant and had no personal grudges. This accusation was made from a public and righteous standpoint because the defendant had relied on enemy power to control all the coal in Shanghai, prohibiting free trade, exploiting peers, and harming the people's livelihood. Therefore, after the victory, more than one hundred peers jointly accused him.</p>
<p>The defendant's defense lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Xu Zuoliang, also stood up and eloquently argued that while more than one hundred peers had signed and sealed the accusation, the defendant also had over one hundred peers who had jointly guaranteed that the defendant had committed no criminal acts. They also pointed out that the seals on the seams of the joint accusation letter were connected, which was highly suspicious, and asked the court to pay attention to this point. They also presented many evidentiary documents that were favorable to the defendant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, while Shen testified in court, he held a folding fan, gesturing east and west, and repeatedly said "Amitabha," "My sins," and "Heaven knows." When he spoke with indignation, his face turned red, and he often patted his chest, as if overwhelmed with grief. After the hearing, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. He held the fan in both hands and bowed to the court, saying, "Thank you, my lords," "Thank you, my lords." After briefly talking to his family and friends, he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipu, Sun Zuji</p>
<p>On the same day, the case of Zhang Yipu was tried. Zhang was the chief of the telegraph section of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In September of the 30th year (1941), he was transferred to be the director of the puppet Military Commission's Radio Telegraph Main Station. The station had one 150-watt machine and three 50-watt machines, which were exclusively used to send telegrams for the puppet Military Commission's subordinate puppet troops and senior officials of the puppet government. Branch stations were set up in all important areas, totaling over one hundred. All the radio operators were mostly graduates from the Nanyang Radio School, which was run by the defendant himself. After questioning, the court ordered him to be held for further questioning.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of Sun Zuji, the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, was also adjourned for further questioning after witnesses were questioned.</p>
<p>Shen Fenggang, Indicted</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Shen Fenggang, the director of the Fourth Division of the "76th" Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was arrested by our military authorities after the victory and transferred to the court. Recently, the High Prosecutor's Office completed the investigation and formally filed a public prosecution. In addition, Wang Yanfu was also indicted on suspicion of being a traitor.</p>
<p>Six Cases, Seven People, Sentencing Today</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At 9:30 this morning, the Commercial Court will announce the sentences in a large number of suspected traitor cases, including: (1) Ye Jixiang, the wife of Li Shi-qun, the ringleader of the "76th" Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, (2) Chen Guoquan, the director of the Puppet Rice and Grain Control Committee, (3) Shen Zaya, the chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association, (4) Jiang Yougen, the chairman of the "Zhejiang Ningbo Red Gang Carpenters' Union," and Zuo Ming, a translator for the Japanese company Yamakyu (previously sentenced to life imprisonment by various divisions of the High Court, appealed and returned for retrial), (5) Qian Jieyi, a counselor of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and the director of the Suzhou Branch of the Puppet China Cooperative, (6) Sun Pengfei, an officer of the Beiqiao District Office of the Puppet Shanghai County.</p>
<h3 id="e58">High Court Sentences Two Traitors Yesterday, Wu Song to be Sentenced on the 6th <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court announced the sentences in two traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Fu Qian'geng, the standing director of the Puppet Oil and Grain Control Committee, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. (2) Ma Le, an informant for the Suzhou enemy military police, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. All the property of the two criminals will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families.</p>
<p>The cases of Wu Song and Guan Yifeng were also concluded on the same day, and both were scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on August 6th. Wu had previously served as the director of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and a legal specialist for the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations before the war. In May of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he joined the puppet government and successively served as a member of the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality of the Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the First District Office of the Puppet Shanghai Municipality, and the secretary-general of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. In February of the 34th year (1945), he was promoted to the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration, until the victory. During the debate yesterday, Wu wore a gray silk robe, deep glasses, and his hair was gray, showing his old age. Standing in the defendant's dock with a paper fan in his hand, he stated that during his tenure as the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration, he had issued an amnesty decree, as a result of which more than 700 prisoners were released. As for the "Greater East Asia War Commemoration Meeting" and other speeches published in the newspapers during his tenure as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, it was because the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo was not in Shanghai, so he represented him, but the draft was written by the puppet propaganda department, which was just a formality. Yu Chuanmin, Zhu Yigui, Gu Wang Yingxia, and others were also summoned to testify in court, proving that the defendant had rescued underground workers and other matters.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Four Steps Formulated to Organize and Manage the City's Twenty-Four Small Vegetable Markets <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Every morning, Shanghai's twenty-four small vegetable markets are the most noisy, dirty, and chaotic places. How to make them tidy, clean, and orderly is indeed an urgent task. According to Section Chief Ling of the Health Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Health Bureau has now formulated four steps to organize and manage the vegetable markets: (1) Issuing stallholder licenses, which has already been largely completed. (2) Adjusting stalls: In the past, the stalls in the vegetable markets were arranged in a haphazard and disorderly manner. According to the plan, they will be arranged by category. For example, fish, meat, and vegetables will all be gathered in one place, which will be much more convenient for buyers. More than ten vegetable markets, including those on North Sichuan Road and Hongkou Triangle, have already been organized according to the plan, with only four or five places, such as Zhoushan Road and Seymour Road, yet to be implemented. (3) Banning open-air vegetable markets outside the markets: Setting up stalls in the open air along the road is most likely to obstruct traffic, and the dust is also detrimental to hygiene, so it is necessary to strictly ban them. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that there are many refugees and unemployed people in society today, and it is quite difficult to ban them all at once. (4) Banning miscellaneous goods stalls inside the markets: Many vegetable markets have many stallholders who do not fall within the scope of "small vegetables," such as those selling bamboo products and scraps of cloth. The largest number of miscellaneous stalls are general snack stalls. According to the vegetable market reorganization plan, they are all subject to banning. There are two ways to ban them: (1) Order these miscellaneous stalls to automatically convert to other small vegetable stalls. (2) Otherwise, order them to move out. The implementation methods are currently being discussed with the relevant police stations. Section Chief Ling also said that the current rent for vegetable market stallholders is only 600 yuan per month, while the monthly management fee for each vegetable market is as high as 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is a huge deficit. Therefore, the vegetable market management fee is currently one of the municipal government's business expenses, purely for the purpose of serving the citizens.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Minister of Food, Xu Kan, will come to Shanghai at the beginning of the month, reportedly in connection with explaining the grain loan case. In addition, Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of grain administration who has returned to the country and is now in Beijing, will also come at that time. However, it is understood that the military authorities believe that there is no need for an interrogation. As for the rumor that Yang Xizhi had surrendered to the Garrison Headquarters, the reporter inquired separately from the grain administration and the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, but both were unable to confirm it.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Commander Tie Wu of the Garrison stated to reporters yesterday that the Garrison Headquarters does not have much connection with Yang Xizhi in this case at present, so they do not advocate an interrogation by the Military Law Office. However, the District Prosecutor's Office must summon Yang Xizhi to court at the beginning of next month for investigation. Regarding the account books of the grain loan merchants, the District Prosecutor's Office has designated Yuan Jitang, Chen Derong, Liu Wei'an, and Xu Wennu, all professors and accountants from the accounting department of Fudan University, to examine the relevant account books of the grain merchants in the grain loan case. It has been more than ten days, and it is understood that the internal situation is very complicated, and it will take about another week to complete the examination and report. It is also heard that Wang's wife has become ill with worry over this case and has been admitted to a certain hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>A Discussion with Scout Founder Yan Jialin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 30th] This reporter encountered Yan Jialin, the founder of the Scout movement, at the Deming Hotel yesterday. According to him: The Scout movement is essentially basic civic education and also character education. The twelve Scout laws, for example, contain the norms for training a noble citizen. Technical training, on the other hand, is secondary. Today, the Scout movement is gradually declining, focusing solely on formal exercises and forgetting the original meaning. It can be said that the current Scout movement has lost its soul, only the form remains, and it has become a kind of embellishment in school education, used as decoration, and as a tool for welcoming and sending off. Finally, he solemnly stated that society often confuses the Scout movement with physical education. This misconception must be corrected. Scout training emphasizes moral, intellectual, and physical education equally, while physical education only emphasizes physical training, just as bricklayers and carpenters are both needed for construction, but bricklayers cannot also be carpenters.</p>

<p>The first Volleyball League, with four men's and women's games, competed at the Municipal Stadium from 5:30 PM yesterday. There were about 300 spectators, and the atmosphere was still enthusiastic.

In the second game, the Soviet Union became even more rampant and won with 21 to 7. After the start of the third game, Guangdong slightly turned the corner and once led with 5 to 2.

<p>The Ministry of Interior yesterday sent an official letter to the Municipal Government stating: "Following the end of the war and the beginning of reconstruction, disputes of various civil and criminal natures, such as those involving land, debt, and marriage, are bound to increase. To reduce litigation and save manpower and resources, each district office should be supervised to establish a mediation committee according to the regulations on the organization of township mediation committees. These committees should earnestly handle civil and criminal mediation matters. Prior to this, fair-minded individuals with legal knowledge within each district should be encouraged to be selected as mediation committee members. The municipal government, in conjunction with the court, should convene these members for a short training course to facilitate implementation and comply with official regulations."</p>
<p>Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth Districts Adjust Areas</p>
<p>The case of adjusting the areas of the 29th, 30th, and 31st districts of Pudong was decided by the Municipal Government in March of this year. The old Yangsi and Tangqiao districts were incorporated into the 29th district, Yangjing and Luxing districts into the 30th district, and Gaohang and Gaoqiao into the 31st district. The police bureau had already complied with the order to adjust its divisions to align with the administrative changes. However, due to delays caused by the Senatorial elections, the adjustments have not yet been implemented. The Civil Affairs Bureau convened the district chiefs of the respective districts on the 26th to complete handover procedures. The 30th district should transfer nine "bao" (neighborhood) units of Tangqiao district to the jurisdiction of the 29th district. Both parties have agreed to complete the handover by August 1st.</p>
<p>Senator Resigns Concurrent Position. Chen Bingguo, a senator from the 29th district, was originally a representative of the 11th "bao" of that district.

<h3 id="e105">Question and Answer Session <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau recently responded to Mr. You Tang's question: "How can a person who lives in a hotel obtain household registration?"</p>
<p>"Upon investigation, this case was previously referred to the Ministry of Interior for clarification, which was granted as follows: (1) People moving in from other counties or cities, who intend to reside for an extended period but do not have a fixed residence, and who have lived in a hotel for more than one month, should be registered for household registration in accordance with the amended household registration law. If the party concerned is unwilling to register for household registration, they should be registered for relocation. (2) Residents of this city who have returned to their hometowns after the war and are temporarily staying in hotels should be registered for household registration. (3) After the above two types of people are registered for household registration, they must register a change of address when their place of residence is confirmed. If you intend to reside for an extended period, you can follow the above regulations and apply to the security office in your area to complete the procedures for household registration or relocation."</p>
<p>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>(5) Question: Regarding inquiries about age, people's answers are mostly untrue. How can accuracy be ensured?</p>
<p>Answer: First ask the age, then ask the zodiac sign of birth, then the year number of birth, and finally the animal sign. Then check the 120-year age, zodiac year number, and animal sign table, and the lunar and solar calendar comparison table. The four should be cross-verified to ensure accurate age. If the family has a birth record book, the age should be determined accordingly.</p>
<p>(6) Question: When inquiring about age and date of birth, many people answer using the lunar calendar. If the Gregorian calendar is mistakenly used, there will be many errors and the person may be unable to answer. How should this be remedied?</p>
<p>Answer: You can ask for the lunar calendar for verification, and then refer to the actual age conversion table attached to the supplementary explanation for filling out the form promulgated and revised by this department on July 27, 1943, to determine their age and date of birth.</p>
<p>(7) Question: In the same household registration area, the son of A and the daughter of B, both with the same original domicile, are both widowed and have been cohabiting for years. They have two children together, and each has parents living with them who are being supported. In society, they are already regarded as a family. According to the definition of "family" in the household registration law, this type of cohabiting person and their parents and children, who live together and share a common life, should be registered as one family for household registration purposes. However, how should the relationship of each person be filled in on the application form?</p>
<p>Answer: For those who have formed a family through cohabitation, the relationship of the people involved in the application form should be filled in as "cohabiting family members" for the cohabiting parties. The children born from the cohabitation should be regarded as children born in wedlock according to Article 1065 of the Civil Code, and all others should be filled in as "related family members."</p>
<p>(8) Question: What surname should illegitimate children use?</p>
<p>Answer: Illegitimate children, that is, children born out of wedlock according to the Civil Code, whose parents cannot be determined, are considered abandoned children in household registration. Article 58, Section 2, of the Household Registration Law originally stipulated that the director of household registration should give them a surname and name. This should be considered based on the situation at the time, without the need for separate standards. If the abandoned child has been adopted, the surname should be that of the adoptive parent according to Article 1078 of the Civil Code, and the application for registration of birth should be processed according to the usual procedures. In addition, if the birth mother of a child born out of wedlock marries, the child should take the mother's surname according to Article 1065, Section 2 of the Civil Code.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Dyeing and Weaving Industry Operates at Less Than 30% Capacity; Dye Prices Plummet; Only Indanthrene Blue Still Popular <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] May and June are normally slow months, but due to high interest rates and economic difficulties in rural areas, the dyeing and weaving industry is experiencing increasing difficulties. According to sources in the industry's core, current operations are at less than 30% capacity. As a result, the trend for raw materials is weak. Even vulcanized dyes, which have been the most popular in recent months, are declining. American BG yuan is currently selling for 9.23 million, but there are few buyers, a decrease of more than 100,000 compared to a month ago. However, 693 yuan is still standing at the 1.2 million yuan mark because the brand has already been sold. The price was the same a month ago, which is commendable. According to sources from importers, there have been considerable arrivals of vulcanized dyes and alkaline dyes, which is making people more nervous and sales more sluggish. Alkaline dyes were priced at around 50,000 yuan in May and June, but now 35,000 yuan is hardly attracting buyers. It is said that orders from companies such as Meihe Yanghang will be released in large quantities soon, so the price drop is inevitable. However, people in the raw material industry say that if the price drops further, no one will be willing to sell because the cost plus taxes and transportation is not small. The example of insurance powder is a good example of this. Insurance powder was priced at 370,000 to 380,000 yuan in March and April. Later, due to strong orders, no one dared to buy even at 130,000 yuan. In the end, due to cost factors, the price could not be reduced further, and recently it has rebounded slightly. Caustic soda is still being sold through American Yue brand, priced at 500,000 yuan. The delivery of goods by Bui Nei Men is stable, and the selling price can still be maintained, but it has fallen by more than 100,000 yuan compared to a month ago. Indanthrene Blue can be described as the darling of dyes at the moment. Although the market for dyeing factories is narrow, the stock of Defu Yanghang is almost exhausted. Some even claim that there are only about 20 barrels left, which can only produce 20,000 bolts of cloth. Scarcity drives up the price, so the price is uniquely high, currently around 18 million yuan, almost double what it was a month ago. What is strange is that the American Bausch &amp; Lomb Blue, which competes with it, has not arrived for a long time, so the less there is of it, the higher the price. Other dyes and raw materials are beyond reach. In terms of the situation of dyeing factories, there is a shortage of both capital and inventory. Therefore, when there are more arrivals, the price falls due to the small purchasing power, and when the goods are out of stock, the price rises due to the thinness of the inventory.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Morale is Low; Speculation is High; Gold Prices Continue to Fall; US Dollars Also Drop by 30 Yuan <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, a large amount of Mexican gold is being shipped to Hong Kong, which may flow into China. However, due to the ban on gold exports in Hong Kong, morale is low, but low prices can still be supported. In the early morning, it fell from 1.895 million to 1.885 million. There was some speculation, but at low prices, money changers absorbed some of it, so there was not much change. The central government allocated 60 bars at a price of 1.89 million. After 10 o'clock, securities fell, and idle funds purchased some, which briefly rose to around 1.9 million. At noon, it still hovered around 1.89 million. In the afternoon, it continued to decline, and finally there was a low price. Guang Bang sold, and as a result, the closing price fell another 27,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was reduced to 1 million yuan. Silver ingots and silver dollars were not changed. Secret interest rates were stable, and interest rates remained the same.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange US dollars are boring. Yesterday the market was still short. In the early morning, it was between 2,480 yuan and 2,490 yuan. It briefly rose to above 2,500 yuan in the middle, but it was still around 2,490 yuan at noon. Scrutiny has become more severe, and idle funds are afraid and dare not move, so there is no way to revitalize it. In the afternoon, the gold market weakened again, and it was brought down to a low price at the close. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong bills were calm and unchanged. Hong Kong dollars fell slightly. There was trading around 550 yuan. Indian exchange was sold at 668 yuan. British exchange was sold at 8,900 yuan, but they could not be maintained. US exchange trading was still rare.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Government bonds fell again, and transactions decreased again. Series C bonds fell from 700 yuan to 680 yuan. They hovered in this range from the opening and remained unchanged. As a result, they fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were the same. Series D fell by 30 yuan, and Series E also fell by 40 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, rayon fell across the board. No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened at 1.56 million yuan. The lowest traded was 550,000 yuan. There were not a few who absorbed it at low prices. The closing price recovered to a high of 570,000 yuan, which was 30,000 yuan less than the previous day. Other brands of goods were reduced by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Factory processed goods were favored. Meiya bed coverings and Dacheng checkered crepe were good. Huajin crepe fell another 20 yuan yesterday. The worst was only 1,900 yuan.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks were affected yesterday by the news that the US donation of stocks in Meiya had been confirmed by the company's shareholders to be incorrect. People were disturbed. Except for Yongsha, which could still be supported as a speculative target, the rest were affected and fell. Meiya was the most cowardly and tired, breaking the 4,000 yuan mark. It was still flickering in the middle, going from high to low. In the end, it was still relatively stable. Yongsha high price 680 yuan, Meiya 4,330 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 245 yuan, Qinxing 188 yuan, low price Shuisha 652 yuan, Meiya 3,930 yuan, Jingfu 233 yuan, Xinguang 228 yuan, Qinxing 165 yuan, and then the market turned. As a result, Yongsha He fell by 15 yuan, Meiya fell by 310 yuan, Jingfu fell by 10 yuan, Xinguang fell by 8 yuan, Qinxing fell by only 3 yuan, because the price was low and some people maintained it. The small and medium-sized stocks, which were relatively cold, also fell slightly. The old stocks were stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks gradually stabilized. It was difficult to continue to liquidate. Fatigue was seen in the middle, but it was short-lived and soon rebounded. Yisha fell from 8,900 yuan to 8,500 yuan. In the end, it struggled at the closing price of the previous day. As a result, Steel, Paper, and Huidong were slightly higher than the previous close. Yinglian Yisha Yipie, Guanghang Industry were stable and unchanged.</p>

<p>What is the View of Chinese People?</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 30th] Agricultural officials at the University of Tennessee have proposed a seven-point plan to improve American cotton, including paying attention to soil, collective production, calculating labor, controlling pests, and selecting superior varieties. Some of these points will be strengthened in the Tennessee Mechanical Cotton Production Experiment Field, which is under the direction of the Southwest Development Bureau, this year.</p>
<p>Raw Sugar Continues to Soften</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable because there was not much white sugar on the upper end. Raw sugar was weak because the next batch was arriving. The public association opened the Chongti Qing price at 88,000 yuan, and Huanggang Qing at 86,000 yuan, down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There were less than 100 packages traded. Xinghua helped to sell more than 60 baskets of ordinary red at 113,000 to 114,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Middle and Lower Rice Sales are Rare; Oil Market Has Not Recovered <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 7,000 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. There were slight transactions in high-quality white japonica rice. The middle and lower quality rice remained sluggish. Indica rice digestion was light, and the middle and lower quality rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. More and more white yuan rice arrived, and the market weakened. Sales were not good. Flour transactions continued, and the price rose by 400 to 500 yuan. However, the market was slightly tired at the close. There was a shortage of wheat shipping space, and customers were not happy, so the price fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Bran sales were active in rural areas, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean arrivals and sales were even, and the market fluctuated. The middle and lower oil mills were less willing to buy, and the price fell by 400 to 500 yuan. High-quality mung beans rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sales were more active than yesterday, but there were still few transactions in the middle and lower quality. Raw peanuts digested and dropped by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Fresh bean cakes sold actively in rural areas, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. The trend for old goods was average. Cotton and vegetable cakes were similar. The oil market has not yet opened.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Social Affairs Bureau Will Find a Way to Suppress the City's Oil Prices <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The price of cooking oil has soared in recent days, and there is still no market. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this matter. Director Wu Kaixian sent a special letter to Vice Minister Xiao Zheng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs the night before (29th), forwarding it to Minister Wang, requesting the two major oil factories under the ministry, Zhongzhi and Zhongshi, to cooperate with the bureau to suppress the city's oil prices. Xiao has agreed to convey the message. Wu told people yesterday that the soaring prices of cooking oil in the city in recent days are extremely unreasonable. In order to safeguard the interests of the citizens, I have decided to take action. In the past two days, I have sent Ji Kewei to the Zhongzhi factory to discuss with the manufacturer how to suppress the price of oil. According to various investigations, the city's cooking oil inventory is still sufficient, and the inventory can meet the needs of three months. As for the rumors that there are few arrivals from Qingdao, the situation is not serious. The city's cooking oil source is dependent on Changzhou and Wuxi, accounting for 30%. Qingpu, Songjiang, and Shanghai local production accounts for 30%. Bengbu accounts for 10%. Qingdao and northern Jiangsu account for only 30%. Moreover, Qingdao cooking oil is still being shipped to Shanghai, so there is no shortage of sources.</p>
<h3 id="e114">850 Rice Shops Apply to Distribute Unpolished Rice by District <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Bean and Rice Industry Association to register for the purpose of distributing unpolished rice universally. As of today, 850 rice shops have applied. Each rice shop must be jointly guaranteed by three shops and preliminarily approved by the Industry Association before submitting it to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. First-class rice shops are allocated 20 bags of rice each time, and second-class rice shops are allocated 10 bags of rice each time. The city is divided into 26 districts. Once the authorities have completed the review, the rice can be distributed and sold at a flat price in sequence. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the current inventory of Sichuan and Jiangxi rice is very abundant. The first batch of 72,170 bags has already arrived in port, and the second batch of 70,000 bags of foreign rice will also be shipped in the next few days. The registered rice merchants will gradually sell it at a flat price. The citizens' food supply should not be a concern in the next two months.</p>
<h3 id="e115">New Water Tung Branches are Seen <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The new goods of this year's Water Tung branches have been delayed due to the lack of direct shipping to Shanghai. Now a batch has been shipped from Guangdong. It was heard that the North Market has already opened, and the first batch is not more than 130,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yarn and Printed Cloth Remain Sluggish <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flower market started with fatigue. In the early morning, Shuangma was still stable, and 1.32 million transactions were made. Then, Shenxin Yarn Factory devalued and sought to sell. Shuangma sold at a price of 1.25 million, and 20-count Hongrenzhong was sold at a price of 1.2 million, and the amount was very large. Therefore, 20-count brands fell because of this. Small and medium-sized yarns fell by 20,000 to 30,000. Transactions were still rare. However, 42-count double-strand thread was priced at 30,000 yuan because Fangjian had not supplied it the day before.</p>
<p>Yesterday's New York American cotton telegraph was weak in the near term and strong in the long term, with an increase or decrease of 20 or more pounds. The near-term American gold was 32.10, the long-term new flower was 29.27, and the MITL current price was 32.78. Local spot cotton transactions were still rare. Due to the unevenness of foreign cotton, and the fact that the end of the month is approaching, Fangjian and private yarn factories are still waiting and seeing, and there is no purchase. Only the flower shop has a little transaction. The market is generally tired.</p>
<p>The cloth market is boring and unbearable, and current sales are bleak. Therefore, the market is unstable, and the performance has fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. At noon, Fangjian routinely sold Huaji and various cloths, and the price fell by 500 yuan compared with the last time, but the purchasers were as rare as morning stars.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the company directly distributed sugar to retailers, the general sugar merchants saw that there was no goods to handle. They petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for relief, believing that the implementation of this measure would cause thousands of employees to lose their jobs. However, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that the sugar industry claimed to still have 15,000 packages of the sixth batch of sugar, and it has not been reported whether it has been sold out, to whom it has been sold, and at what price. Therefore, the distribution of the seventh batch of sugar to the sugar industry has been temporarily suspended. Whether it can be distributed as before will depend on the report submitted by the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e119">350 Boxes of Tea are Exported; New and Old Tea are Matched in a 3:7 Ratio <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The number of finished red and green teas transported to Shanghai recently is not small, and they are only sold domestically. They are not shipped abroad. The reason is nothing more than the high cost, which has not been able to balance with the export price, so it has not been promoted. It is reported that Huacha Company is scheduled to load 350 boxes of tea on the Sterling vessel sailing from Shanghai to the United States on August 4, including 250 boxes of black tea and the rest green tea, weighing a total of 25,000 pounds. The price of black tea is no more than 57 cents per pound, and the price of green tea is no more than 48.85 cents per pound. According to the above prices, all have not exceeded the US limit. As for how the company promotes the export of Chinese tea, it adopts the method of mixing new and old tea leaves. The content of this batch of goods is 30% new tea, and the rest is old tea, but the stored tea is selected to be qualified. It is also learned that the foreign credit certificate for this shipment can be sent to Shanghai today and tomorrow, at which time it can be delivered to the Bank of China for a foreign exchange low-interest loan package, with a weekly interest rate of only 6%.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Industrial Raw Materials; Arrive in Droves; Weak Outlets; Price Increase; Many Speculators <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Foreign ships loaded with American industrial raw materials have arrived in port one after another, including zinc oxide powder, paraffin, bleaching powder, rosin, paint, and soda ash. Due to the blockage of domestic transportation in Shanghai, actual sales are getting worse and worse. Currently, raw material merchants have two kinds of styles: one is that when foreign prices are constantly rising, those with strong strength mostly stay put, allowing the goods to pile up and wait for the opportunity; the other is that they cannot resist the burden of high interest rates, and once the goods arrive in port, they sell them off to seek money. However, according to the observation of general merchants, the raw materials that are urgently needed in China are also in short supply in the United States. Many raw materials cannot be purchased specifically. There are currently many raw materials that the United States prohibits from exporting, such as caustic soda. However, in terms of the amount of industrial raw materials stored in Shanghai, if the various transportation lines are gradually restored, there will be no excess.</p>
<p>It is also reported that merchants in this port have received letters and telegrams from American exporters or manufacturers that prices have generally increased by one to two, and it is heard that the futures price of American caustic soda is more than 40 US dollars per 100 pounds.</p>
<p>The Production Cost of Products in this Factory is Higher than that of Imported Products</p>
<p>The production cost of factories in Shanghai is not only higher than that of foreign countries, but also higher than anywhere in China. It is learned that the chemical raw materials produced in this city, such as sulfuric acid bleaching powder, are threatened by products from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The price of Hong Kong sulfuric acid and Taiwan bleaching powder, including all transportation costs from the place of production to Shanghai, is much lower than that of products in this city. Therefore, many batches of the above-mentioned chemical raw materials have poured in due to the certainty of profit.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Domestic Tea Prices Gradually Rise <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Recently, domestic sales of red and green tea have been extremely prosperous, especially aged top-grade Bailin and aged medium-grade Zhucha. Shops and brokers in this street are competing to purchase them, leading to repeated price increases. As a result, each dan (unit of weight) has risen by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to before. As for Tuzhuang Huzhou Chouzhen, which is exclusively transported abroad, its new goods this year have been selling since recently. Although the British firm Anhe Yanghang has continued to import 26 boxes, the market sentiment is downward, with each dan falling by 200,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yulong Yanghang purchased 134 boxes of Taiwan's top-grade red tea, priced at 67,000 yuan per dan, and 80 boxes of Wuyuan aged special tribute tea, priced at 38,000 yuan per dan. The trend is still stable.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rumors circulating that the Social Affairs Bureau is controlling prices are unfounded. However, given the significant fluctuations in prices in this port, the bureau drafted a set of regulatory principles two weeks ago and submitted them to the municipal government for approval. The main idea is not to adopt control or price-limiting methods, but rather to use a discussion approach. When necessary, various industry associations will negotiate and set prices autonomously, while the government will stipulate a range for price increases and decreases, prohibiting drastic rises and falls, to reduce volatility and curb speculation. However, if the municipal government does not approve it, or if there is no actual need, it is not intended to implement it universally.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wheat Loan Review Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday, Deciding on Six Major Principles for Wheat Loans <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Wheat Loan Review Committee held its first meeting yesterday, chaired by the committee chairman Zhao Di. At the meeting, six major principles were decided for important issues related to wheat loans: (1) Wheat should be purchased in different regions, and the price should be determined by the Flour Industry Joint Office in conjunction with the loan syndicate and reported to the Ministry of Food. If the purchase price exceeds 5%, it must also be reported to the Ministry of Food. (2) Flour production standards should comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. However, due to the different qualities of wheat produced in various regions, industry associations should submit the actual maximum flour yield rate to the Ministry of Food for approval based on actual conditions. (3) The sales areas for the produced flour should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. However, if there is a surplus in the current fourth consumption area, it may be transported to other ports for sale or purchased by the Ministry of Food. (4) Flour sales prices should be negotiated separately by the Flour Industry Joint Office in conjunction with the syndicate, based on the actual conditions in the sales area, and reported to the review committee for approval. (5) The loan syndicate respects the opinions of the Flour Industry Association, but the association should be responsible for meeting the government's expectations, and large and small factories should cooperate with each other. (6) Banks participating in the syndicate must not easily change the loans to flour mills. The above six principles will be used by the Flour Industry Joint Office to formulate detailed measures and submit them to the review committee for review. The terms regarding loan methods, duration, interest rates, etc., will be formulated by the syndicate.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Journey to Northern Jiangsu, Part 1: The Complaint of Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Special correspondent Hang Zhou, communication from Taixian of this newspaper, dated the 28th.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu—a large, fertile area north of the Yangtze River within Jiangsu Province, with beautiful fields. However, like other so-called "liberated areas" in China, its people still have to wander and flee while people around the world are enjoying peaceful and stable lives. The Chinese Communist Party has made this area one of the main targets of its armed struggle to seize political power.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other parts of China are closely watching the developments in Northern Jiangsu. Because Northern Jiangsu is only separated from Nanjing and Shanghai by a river, people's concern for it may even exceed that for the Northeast. Since the peace negotiations were used as a means of "delay" by the Communist Party and yielded no results, Northern Jiangsu has become the scene of the most acute struggle after the Northeast.</p>
<p>This struggle was undoubtedly created and launched by the Communist Party, but the leaders of the Communist Party are trying to hide it from the eyes of the world, and people around the world are also confused by its clever propaganda. As a result, Northern Jiangsu has almost become a mysterious place. "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." To uncover this mystery, this reporter recently went to Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Mood of the People</p>
<p>On July 20th, I set off from Shanghai and arrived in Yangzhou, a military stronghold in Northern Jiangsu, the next day. I stayed for three days and then inspected Taixing, where the fighting had been most intense a few days before. Afterwards, I came to another military stronghold—Taixian. In the past week, I have been to places that were either harassed by the Communist army not long ago or were only a short distance from the militia used by the Communist army, and I could hear gunfire at any time. Residents who have experienced many hardships have unanimously told reporters: "Will there ever be an end to our suffering? You journalists should announce the truth to the world and awaken widespread sanction!"</p>
<p>What is the mood of the people in Northern Jiangsu today? I will only write about a personal experience:</p>
<p>On July 24th, a jeep carrying several people in yellow military uniforms came to Xuanjiabao in Taixing County after the great battle. A girl of thirteen or fourteen was the first to spot it and shouted, "The family members are here!" Her voice trembled with joy.</p>
<p>I glanced at her approvingly. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to talk to her much, but I didn't need to talk much either. I already knew the pain she had suffered in the past and the excitement of seeing her "family members."</p>
<p>It turns out that the people of Northern Jiangsu generally call the National Army "family members." When the New Fourth Army came, they kept their faces taut, their hearts沉着, and their eyes looked at each other with gray eyes. The right hand stretched out four fingers under the cover of the left hand without saying a word.</p>
<p>The Three-Part Play of the Communist Army</p>
<p>In 1940, the New Fourth Army of the Communist Party sneaked into Northern Jiangsu. At that time, there were only a thousand people, and Chen Yi's position was still the commander of the column. On the surface, they were obeying orders to resist the "enemy," but in secret, they came with a major conspiracy. The methods they used were: divide the National Army; organize the people; and tacit agreement with the enemy.</p>
<p>However, the Communist Party does not admit that they did not resist Japan. In fact, they did resist Japan, but it only happened under the following circumstances: When the Japanese army in a certain place only had one company, and the Communist army had several divisions, with sufficient troops and weapons to fight against them, they would attack in one go and occupy that place. As for when the Japanese army counterattacked them, they never had the concept of defending the territory. To preserve their strength for internal use, they would quickly "transfer."</p>
<p>When the National Army was fighting the Japanese army, they hid behind and harassed, ambushed, and looted by fire, intentionally or unintentionally assisting the Japanese army and weakening the National Army's strength.</p>
<p>In organizing the people, anyone who was young was considered a member of the New Fourth Army once they were organized. They plundered the land of the wealthy and distributed it to the poor, who naturally enjoyed following them.... In this way, within a few years, the New Fourth Army grew from ten to a hundred to a thousand, becoming a powerful force. In addition to the regular army, there were local teams and militias. How many in total? Maybe three or four hundred thousand!—It's hard to say an exact number.</p>
<p>The controlled areas were only a few "points" and "lines" for the National Army, and a large number of "areas" fell into the hands of the Communist army, roughly in a ratio of one to five. The New Fourth Army relied on the national crisis to rise, and the entire Chinese Communist Party relied on the national crisis to rise. During the Anti-Japanese War, the national crisis wealth made by traitors and corrupt officials in the occupied areas and the rear was nothing compared to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Whether in military, economic, or political terms, the Communist Party has deep roots in Northern Jiangsu, naturally occupying an advantageous position. Therefore, if you want the Communist Party to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, it will be as difficult as wanting the Communist Party to withdraw from Yan'an. The Communist Party not only wants to maintain its existing power in Northern Jiangsu, but also, under the current complex international situation, has begun to use this base to attempt to invade Jinghu and shake the foundation of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Battle of Taixing Before and After <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>This is evident in the recent Battle of Taixing. At the beginning of the campaign, the Communist Party used its usual trick to vigorously propagate that the National Army would take the offensive, confusing the eyes and ears of international personnel. However, those who understand the overall situation know that the Communist Party's propaganda is nothing more than a fantastic myth. Because if the National Army takes any military action, it is to respond to the Communist Army's offensive. If the Communist Army wants to fight the National Army, they can't tell the National Army not to fight back!</p>
<p>From a topographical point of view, Taixing is southeast of Taixian and only separated from Jiangyin by a river. The Communist Army's intelligence is very good. They learned that the National Army only had one regiment stationed there, with weak forces, so they secretly transferred thirteen regiments of troops, led by Su Yu, the commander of the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army, in an overwhelming posture, and marched rapidly towards Taixing. At the same time, they sent another nine regiments to attack Xuanjiabao, an important stronghold north of Taixing, so that the National Army could not provide reinforcements. The garrison of Xuanjiabao was also only one regiment.</p>
<p>The Communist Army's strategy was quite clever. If it had succeeded, the situation in Jinghu today would have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>But it failed! This was beyond its expectations. On the evening of July 13th, it began to attack, taking the county magistrate and administrative staff who were prepared to take over with them, and telling them, "You can go in four hours."</p>
<p>Frenzied Attack</p>
<p>With a ratio of thirteen to one, the Communist Army rushed forward one after another, truly "brave" to the extreme, launching a violent attack on Taixing. The commander of the defending city was Liu Guangyu, the commander of the 56th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division. This was a battle-hardened unit. Last year, in the Xiangxi Campaign, it created brilliant achievements at the foot of Xuefeng Mountain. Facing this group of crazy rioters, they were very calm. The machine guns swept in rows, and the Communist Army fell in batches. Another batch surged up, fell again, and another batch came up. When the defenders ran out of bullets, the city gate was breached. Commander Liu personally led a battalion of soldiers to defend Qingyun Temple inside the city. This Qingyun Temple was not made of steel and concrete, but just an old temple. In an emergency, even the fortifications were very hastily constructed. However, the Communist Army captured the city of Taixing, but could not capture Qingyun Temple. So in fact, the National Army never lost Taixing. From the late night of the 13th to the morning of the 16th, the bloody battle lasted for more than forty-eight hours, and Qingyun Temple stood still. Although the National Army suffered heavy casualties, the Communist Army suffered even greater casualties. When Su Yu arrived in the area and saw this situation, he sighed and said, "The New Fourth Army has never seen such a tenacious army in Northern Jiangsu." He called Commander Liu Guangyu "the most stubborn of the stubborn elements" and also called him "Liu the Madman." When Commander Liu talked to me about it, he said, "What's crazy about me? They want to attack me, can't I just let them capture me"!</p>
<p>The Defenders Sing the National Anthem</p>
<p>A company of the 56th Regiment rushed out when the city was breached and then fought back. The Communist Army thought that reinforcements from the National Army had arrived and panicked. At the same time, Li Tianxia, the commander of the 100th Division, told Commander Liu on the phone, "Taixing is the place where you will succeed or die. We revolutionary soldiers must be worthy of the country. Hold on! Reinforcements are coming." These words were overheard by the Communist Army, which became even more panicked. However, at about 3:00 a.m. on the 16th, they launched a final attack and threw a note into Qingyun Temple demanding Commander Liu's surrender. At this time, the two armies were already in close combat. Commander Liu received the note, tore it to pieces, and said loudly, "Revolutionary soldiers do not surrender"! He and the remaining defenders fought back while singing the national anthem and shouting slogans. They fought to the death, ready to die at any time. When the Communist Army heard the song resounding in the sky inside Qingyun Temple, they were surprised: "Why are there still so many people"? They knew it would be difficult to succeed. On the one hand, they received news that the National Army was already attacking their rear. Their morale was shaken, and the whole army collapsed. At about 5:00 a.m. on the 16th, there was not a single Communist soldier in the city of Taixing.</p>
<p>The success of this battle depended on the defenders' die-hard defense, Commander Li's psychological warfare, the Communist Army's rear attack, and the cooperation of local party and government personnel and the people. County Magistrate Xue Peiqi and Commander Liu were in Qingyun Temple together, never leaving each other.</p>
<p>The situation in Northern Jiangsu was stabilized by this battle. Commander Li Tianxia said, "It is unprecedented in the history of the Anti-Japanese War that a city was breached but not completely captured, and an isolated army was able to hold a stronghold and defeat the invaders, recovering the entire city."</p>
<p>The Battle of Xuanjiabao was as fierce as the Battle of Taixing. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the defenders were left with only seven hundred people. They retreated once, but then Commander Zhong Xiongfei led these seven hundred people back and recaptured the fort.</p>
<p>The total number of Communist Army casualties in the two battles was more than 20,000 (the Communist side admitted to 10,000), while the number of National Army casualties was one-tenth of that. This proves that the Communist Army, apart from relying on a large number of people, is useless in fighting.</p>
<p>After these two battles, the main force of the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu was severely damaged. Therefore, the National Army recovered Huangqiao and Jiangyan without much effort.</p>
<p>People are Afraid of "Delay"</p>
<p>"I dare say," said Commander Li Tianxia, "if there is an order from above to wipe out Northern Jiangsu at this time, the situation in Northern Jiangsu can be cleared up immediately."</p>
<p>However, this is precisely the National Army's distress! The ceasefire order is only being implemented unilaterally. The National Army is bound by this order and cannot take the initiative except to fight back for self-defense. But the Communist Army can tear up the ceasefire agreement whenever they are happy and attack the National Army; and they don't take the ceasefire agreement seriously at all.</p>
<p>The military situation must be transferred along with the political situation, and unfortunately, the political situation is to delay. Delay is exactly what the Communist Party wants. If it delays, the Communist Party can redeploy, slowly "struggle", and delay until the situation is most favorable before launching a large-scale attack.</p>
<p>"We can't delay!" The people of Northern Jiangsu who love their country unanimously shouted: "Delay will drag us into an abyss from which we cannot be saved!"</p>
<p>The facts that the Communist Party wants to conceal can finally no longer be concealed! During the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party propagandized: "We are resisting Japan, and you (referring to the government) are not resisting Japan!" This argument went bankrupt immediately after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War: The Japanese army surrendered to the government. So, the Communist Party immediately changed its tune to: "We are democratic, and you are not democratic." This is really ridiculous. Is the Communist Party democratic? The three million refugees who fled from Northern Jiangsu have already told you clearly; if you still don't believe it, come to Northern Jiangsu to see—the destruction of the entire social order and the destruction of the entire humanity, that is the "democracy" of the Communist Party!</p>
<p>The people of Northern Jiangsu complained: "That is hypocrisy! We want our 'family members' to come back!"</p>

<h3 id="e126">Typhoon Sweeps Over Taiwan <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taiwan Dispatch from this Newspaper, 7th</p>
<p>Typhoons, a special product of Taiwan, have already met this province for the first time this year with a force of 18. Touches of force six to eight have also hit Shanghai. Whether the origins of these great natural storms lie in high or low temperatures is a matter of debate among astronomers in Taiwan and the Philippines. The people of this province are familiar with typhoons, but they cannot help but feel panic when the alerts sound. Now that the first typhoon has passed, the Meteorological Bureau cannot predict when the next wind direction will strike. At the same time, an artificial typhoon is sweeping across the hearts of all the island's inhabitants with equal force. People are worried about how to survive these times and afraid of how to deal with and cope with reality! People say that this unnatural, man-made typhoon was brought by mainlanders and is gradually becoming a specialty of this province.</p>
<p>Unfortunate Women</p>
<p>Taiwan is full of unfortunate women, young, beautiful, and with an elementary education, scattered in taverns, tea houses, and dance halls, serving as extras to be played with and amused by customers, in exchange for hundreds to thousands of legal currency. Some of them have husbands who were drafted and have not been heard from since; some were abandoned by repatriated Japanese; and some have had their entire families sacrificed in bombings. Men have left them to shoulder the burden of life, and life has stolen their youth. They sell their youth under the light of strong liquor and green lamps. They are the fighters on the front lines of the battle of life. Now they face the storm. The authorities have clearly ordered a ban on dancing in July and prostitution in August, and at the same time, the abolition of female attendants. Tens of thousands of female attendants (waitresses) across the province are panicked.</p>
<p>In Taipei, female attendants besieged the office of Xie E, the president of the Women's Association, even making a scene in public. They have only one request: "We need to eat and live." In Kaohsiung, a female attendant named Cai Hua at the Taoyuan Wine House protested the authorities' ban by committing suicide. Actively, more than two hundred people surrounded the residences of Ms. Yang, a cadre of the Women's Association, and Councilor Peng. They have only one hope: the government has banned their profession, so they demand relief and demand work. The public office is responsible for the counties, and the counties and cities are responsible for the townships. The result is that the bans are in place, but these unfortunate women are left empty-handed, or rather, the bans are bans, and the orders are orders!</p>
<p>The Threat of High Prices</p>
<p>Another typhoon force has widely blown onto the people of this province, who are accustomed to taking vehicles and using water and electricity. People no longer recall the Japanese era but use the time of liberation as a ratio. The minimum cost of living used to be 300 yuan, but now it is 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The first batch of rice has been harvested, and the price of rice has fallen to 11 yuan per catty, but the other six of the seven necessities of life have risen in price, so much so that people cannot believe it. Recently, public utilities in this province, such as postal services, telegrams, electricity, tap water, and trains, have all raised prices one after another, or decided to increase the price by two to three times. The various products of public production organizations are also increasing in price. Newspapers have been forced to raise prices from 18 yuan a month to 60 yuan. This is a direct threat to the six million people of the province and further reduces the people's living standards.</p>
<p>The first thing the Director of Transportation did upon arriving in Taiwan was to have the Hebei ship towed to Shanghai for repair. The second thing was to increase the prices of postal services, telegrams, and trains. Postal services alone have a net deficit of more than 10 million yuan per month. In the past, the Japanese relied on the Monopoly Bureau for 40% of their revenue subsidy, but that is no longer possible. The price of electricity, which has risen from 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour to 5 jiao per kilowatt-hour, not only puts heavy pressure on users but also severely hits small factories. Publicly funded production organizations cannot but follow suit and increase prices!</p>
<p>Economists say that the mainstays of Taiwan's industrial and mining production are low electricity prices and cheap labor. Abnormal phenomena during the transition period will cause some factories to maintain a long period of stagnation, right?</p>
<p>Salary Increases, Layoffs, and Unpaid Salaries</p>
<p>Local officials who are without plans, those who came to Taiwan from the mainland through connections, put together a makeshift open-air troupe. Some people came with a slave mentality, but now they are enduring the pain of not being able to return to their hometowns. The government raised salaries starting in May, calculated at 33%, but eliminated subsidies, so the actual increase was not much. However, apart from the public office and the directly affiliated institutions of industry, mining, agriculture, and forestry, few people were able to get their salaries by the end of the month, right? The Taipei County government, which brought 260 people to Taiwan, still had only a small portion of May's salaries paid out. It is said that starting in July, salaries will be discounted by 80%, and there will also be layoffs. The Education Department recently convened a provincial education conference. The reports from various counties and cities were all the same, unanimously saying that there was no money. Elementary school teachers have not received a penny for two or three months. Tainan and Kaohsiung cities have also laid off 48 people out of 192, a ratio of 25%. Other institutions are also planning layoffs.</p>
<p>The wave of unemployment in Taiwan is the main cause of unrest. The laid-off personnel will play a significant role in the ranks of the unemployed, while those who can get a job are living in poverty, barely surviving. It is said that the public office will increase salaries again starting in July, increasing the original 33 times to 55 times, but people are not excited about the salary increase because the salary increase is the prelude to unpaid salaries.</p>
<p>An authoritative scholar told the reporter: "I have never heard of government offices and educational institutions owing salaries before, but now it is not uncommon!"</p>
<p>Class Boycotts, Strikes, Market Closures</p>
<p>Because the authorities cannot pay salaries on time, it often constitutes the main cause of school class boycotts and teacher strikes. In the past few months, starting from the class boycott at National Taiwan University Hospital, there have been almost more than 20 school struggles and class boycotts. Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung have all had them. The entire staff of the Qidu Township Office in Keelung District has also started an unprecedented civil servant strike because they have not received a penny for three months.</p>
<p>The secondary cause of class boycotts and teacher strikes is often the lack of coordination between mainlanders and Taiwanese. The situation in the education sector is now very clear: in some urban areas, Taiwanese have taken over everything. Taking over is not necessarily bad, but taking without managing or managing without taking is not acceptable. Mei Qi, the director of the Taipei City Education Bureau, is one of those who have power but cannot place people, resulting in him feeling discouraged and expressing his desire to retire. The discipline of general schools is now far worse than before. Students can endure hardship and work hard, and are willing to study, but they are easily incited. Some of them even think that whether or not to attend class is a matter of freedom and democracy. The misinterpretation of democracy is also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Recently, more than a dozen taverns in Hsinchu City went on strike to protest donations, and the stalemate has lasted for many days. I think that if life cannot be stable and prices continue to rise, the tide of strikes will only surge and become turbulent, and the distance between Taiwanese and mainlanders will become farther and farther. This is a cause for concern and a difficult problem.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Meteorological Observatory Received <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Xisha Islands, 1,800 kilometers away from Taiwan, were originally Chinese territory. After France occupied Annam, it included them into the French territory. China and France only drew lines on the map, but the Japanese did not. They started building a meteorological observatory on the small island. France protested, but Japan ignored it. The Xisha Islands are under the jurisdiction of Taiwan. Shi Yanhan, the director of the Taiwan Meteorological Bureau, sent personnel on a small boat to take over on December 12 last year. There was no one on the island, not even a corpse, let alone anyone from the Meteorological Bureau. However, the meteorological equipment was intact. Because there was no one to negotiate with, they had no choice but to erect a monument in front of the wind tower and inscribe it with the words: "The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office has completed the takeover." The Meteorological Bureau originally went to take over the Xisha Meteorological Observatory, but in the end, it represented the Governor's Office in taking over the territorial sovereignty of the Xisha Islands. According to Director Shi, "When the staff of the Meteorological Bureau raised the first flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth on this desolate island, there was no band, no people. Seeing the national flag slowly rising in solitude, I was truly filled with infinite emotion. That is how we acquired a new territory for the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Readers, like the reporter, must have the same feelings when they see the photo of the completed takeover wooden sign. Perhaps you think this is a legendary myth, but it is not. This is a very accurate historical record of the takeover of the territory, which Director Shi recently announced to the reporter.</p>

<p>A fellow villager from Xinzhong Township, Xueyan Bridge, Wujin, came to say: The township chief of our village has already decided to levy a field donation this summer: 7% of military rice (substituting wheat) per mu (each package weighs 178 catties on the market scale); 5% of wheat per package for project costs (one-third of which will be used for local education funds, but the education funds needed in our village do not actually need one-third of the 5% package, only one-fifth is enough). Do we need military rice or not (the Shanghai newspaper previously reported that 800,000 dan of military rice owed by Jiangsu Province has been approved for exemption from recovery)? This is a central matter, and we will not deal with it for the time being. As for the so-called project costs, could it be that the township chief and the loafers in the township office spend money on extravagant pleasures, squandering public funds, and this is considered a major project? We don't know if the authorities have clearly stipulated that they do this? Has the government not noticed that the evil flames of the enemy and puppet era that exploited the farmers have been rekindled? In short, we beg the parents and officials of the authorities to relieve the people from their suffering under the principle of valuing the people, so that they can barely survive. Then the countryside will be fortunate! The nation will be fortunate!</p>

<h3 id="e130">Three Sheng Deducted for Rat Consumption <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>This year, I enrolled in the county middle school of Wujiang County as a boarder. Each student pays six dou of rice for meals. As a result, at the end of the semester, each person was specially deducted three sheng of rice for rat consumption. The reason is that the rice stored by the boarders is stored in the (storage room, and it is eaten by rats, so each student is deducted three sheng for rat consumption. However, there are more than 100 boarders in Wujiang Middle School, and more than three dan of rice can be obtained every semester (one semester is four months). Could there be such big rats that eat eight dou of rice every month? There is no shortage of poor farmers' children in Wujiang Middle School. It is already difficult for them to send their children to school, and they have to add three sheng of rice, increasing the burden on parents. Although three sheng of rice is only worth more than 2,000 yuan, it is also a large sum for poor families. I hope that this item can be removed starting from the next semester.</p>

<p>— Calcutta News, July 6th, Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>Having dwelt in my humble abode for thirty years, I came to pay homage to the meditative saint; under the third watch moon on the Ganges, a ten-foot lotus blooms atop the Himalayas; after explaining the emptiness of the military, I try to see my face before birth, seeking the elixir of life from the master, I laugh at myself as a child curing a childhood ailment.</p>
<p>Recalling two years ago, I came to India from my homeland to study, and while discussing Indian philosophy with teachers and friends, I heard of the contemporary Indian sages Sri Aurobindo and Sir Raman, arousing in me a fervent religious longing. Both resided in South India, further fueling my interest in a long journey, an ideal which ultimately became reality. Finally, on April 24th of this year, I met the sages Sri Aurobindo and Raman, adding a brilliant and memorable page to the journey of my life! On the afternoon of April 20th, I left Calcutta, the sweltering heat making the long journey of thousands of miles seem daunting, but the passion of religious faith encouraged me to move forward. Besides several Indian friends, the entire student body of the Calcutta Chinese School saw me off at the station. Soon, the whistle blew, and the train rumbled southward, traveling along the coast. From the train, I gazed at the Bay of Bengal, an expanse of blue sea pouring into the ocean, and closer, at the fields, the verdant spring grass, the scenery of the Buddhist country resembling my homeland of Jiangnan. Reciting the Southern Tang Emperor's poem, "The rising sun paints river blossoms redder than fire, the coming spring makes river waters greener than indigo," I couldn't help but feel transported. There were also several allies on the train, newly arrived from China. Some worked for the 14th Air Force in our country, others served in medical relief on the Burma Road. They expressed their admiration for the bravery of our soldiers and civilians in resisting Japan. Our conversations eased the loneliness of the journey.</p>
<p>(1) A Glimpse of Madras</p>
<p>Two days on the train felt extremely tiring. On the 22nd at noon, I finally arrived in Madras, one of the three major administrative regions of British India, about 1,100 miles from Calcutta. Calculated in our country's miles, it's almost from Guangzhou to Beijing. Although Madras is not as bustling and prosperous as Calcutta, the streets are clean, and the buildings are well-ordered, giving it the air of a modern city. After getting off at Madras Central Station, I, along with Indian friends Sinha Ghattashru and Geshe Samy, transported our luggage by rickshaw to the waiting room at Egmore Station. Then, we visited the local Chinese community leader, Bao Li Zhuguangsheng. Sri Aurobindo resided in French Pondicherry, and the train to that place departed in the evening. Therefore, we used the half-day of daylight to visit friends and see the sights of Madras. There were over a hundred overseas Chinese there, mostly from Shandong province, followed by Hubei and Guangdong provinces. They mostly ran restaurants, shoe stores, and dental clinics, all working hard and passionately contributing to public welfare, earning the respect of the local British and Indian people. Last year, Consul General Jun Jian (now the ambassador to Peru) inspected the area and instructed them to establish a Chinese United Association to promote unity and strengthen friendship. Over the past year, with the efforts of Bao Xianyi, Li Rujie, and Sun Qingtian, significant progress has been made, and they are not behind others in donating money to save the country. Hearing of my arrival, they all came to inquire. With the flames of war raging in our homeland, it is a joy to be able to gather in this Buddhist country. Until 7:00 PM, the train departed from Madras towards Villupuram. The passengers were very crowded, some going to Ceylon, others to the princely state of Travancore. There was also a cloth merchant on the train, a graduate of the University of Madras. We conversed, and he was proud that India had maintained its indigenous culture. I replied that China had also maintained its four-thousand-year-old national culture, but in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, we have adopted Western civilization. Culture and civilization are two different things. You cannot see me wearing Western clothes and immediately label it as Western culture; that would be a great mistake. He agreed. At 11:00 PM, the train arrived at Villupuram Station. I got off and went to the waiting room. At 5:00 AM the next morning, I finally took a special car to French Pondicherry, arriving at my destination at 7:00 AM. Soon, an Indian student came to inquire, "Is Mr. Zhou Xiangguang here?" I replied, "Mr. Zhou is me." This student was named Ayuwang, sent by Indian friend Professor Meiqila to welcome me. We took the car to the ashram (meaning religious research institute). On the way, we met Professor Mei, exchanging brief greetings and inquiring whether Mr. Tan Yunshan was well. They had both studied with Aurobindo in the past. I then went to the Guregang Building to rest. This four-story, rectangular building was designed by a famous Japanese engineer. Each floor has about twenty rooms, and each person occupies one room, making it very comfortable. The building is managed by an English woman named Ms. Menon. Upon seeing me, she was very happy. We felt only serenity and no disturbance of the mind while staying here. The construction cost of this building reached over ten thousand Indian rupees, donated by the King of the princely state of Hyderabad. Sri Aurobindo established an ashram as a place to spread his teachings, with over a hundred buildings located in the east of the city, overlooking the Bay of Bengal, a tranquil and serene place suitable for spiritual practice. Aurobindo is seventy-four years old this year, with white hair and a youthful face, possessing an aura of dignified composure, inspiring respect.</p>
<p>(2) The Compassionate Light of the Mother</p>
<p>Aurobindo graduated from Cambridge University in England in his youth, fluent in Latin, Greek, German, Italian, and especially proficient in Sanskrit and Pali. He served as the president of the public colleges of Baroda and Bengal. Later, due to his advocacy for Indian independence, he participated in actual political activities, organizing the Nationalist Party, serving as its leader. His younger brother also organized revolutionary groups, was suspected of crimes, arrested and imprisoned. Ultimately, due to insufficient evidence, he was imprisoned for over a year before being released. While in prison, Aurobindo devoted himself to Yoga, attained enlightenment, and then traveled to Pondicherry, continuing to publish the "Arya" magazine, proclaiming his enlightenment to the world, revealing the sacredness of life, and seeking to bring all beings to the other shore. For thirty-five years, he has diligently strived, which is readily apparent. Since 1930, Aurobindo has remained silent, not speaking to anyone, except for discussing the Dao with The Mother, Mira Alfassa. The Mother is French, sixty-four years old this year. In her youth, she aspired to cultivate truth. As she grew older, she devoted herself to seeking the Dao, her footprints covering countries around the world. In 1920, she came to India from Japan, met Aurobindo in Pondicherry, and after discussing with him, she had a profound awakening. She then joined Aurobindo in devoting herself to the sacredness of life. The so-called sacredness of life is to transform humanity from ordinary to sacred. She also co-edited the "Arya" magazine with Aurobindo. Today, Aurobindo's disciples call her The Mother, but they call Aurobindo Master. The Mother walks in the garden every morning, at which time all the disciples stand respectfully by the side, palms together, paying their respects. The Mother responds with a smile, radiating compassion. In the evening, there is usually a meditation session. The disciples in the ashram sit together under the Giving Tree, gathering their minds, seeking unity with the Void. The fragrance of the Giving Tree flowers, the gentle breeze caressing the face, at this moment, this scene truly resembles the Seven Jewels adorned Pure Land described in the Amitabha Sutra. After an hour of silent sitting, one feels refreshed in body and mind. If we can break through our ego and reach a state of no-self, then this true self is God. The Dao is not far from people; it is people who distance themselves. At that time, we also individually visited The Mother, as that evening was the 25th anniversary of The Mother's arrival here to cultivate truth. Small paths in the ashram were covered with fresh flowers. When I bowed, The Mother smiled, her compassion evident on her face, and bestowed a flower as a memento. This flower is pure, this flower is sacred. We in the Saha world are all stained with mud, unable to be close to the heart of Heaven, experiencing only suffering and no joy, only vexation and no purity. Reflecting on the flower, my feelings of emotion increase! I placed this flower on my desk, offering my sincere respects, respecting the flower is respecting the heart of Heaven.</p>
<p>(3) A Moment of Connection</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, Aurobindo personally signed and gifted me over ten of his major works, including "The Life Divine" (regarded by Europeans as a major philosophical work of the 20th century), "Essays on the Gita," "The Isha Upanishad," and "The Foundations of Yoga." The Mother did the same. The two elderly people also wanted to gift me their recent photos with their signatures. I am unworthy of such special treatment. In the future, I can only follow the teachings of the two elders, devoting a portion of my effort to the sacred work of human life to repay them. At 2:00 PM, it was the time for us lay disciples to bow and pay homage to Aurobindo. Including the disciples of the ashram, there were about four hundred people, with about a hundred people coming from all over the north and south, including nineteen famous university professors, and many British and French people. At that time, Aurobindo and The Mother sat together in a room, Aurobindo on the right, The Mother on the left. We each held a bouquet of fresh flowers as an offering. When I offered flowers to the two elders, I felt spiritually fulfilled, and all distractions disappeared. Aurobindo wore a white Indian robe, his arms bare, his hair and beard a golden yellow, his spirit vigorous, his demeanor dignified, his body tall and strong. The Mother wore an Indian sari. Both elders smiled in response to us. That moment was the origin of my connection with Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>(4) A Short Stay in Pondicherry</p>
<p>Afterwards, The Mother asked Aurobindo, "Did you see the young Chinese man, Mr. Zhou, who came to visit?" Aurobindo said, "I know him, I saw him." The Indians were even more respectful, as every year no less than ten thousand people request to visit, but only several hundred are granted permission, and even fewer obtain Aurobindo's approval. In the past, the daughter of American President Wilson also came to visit, staying for a short time before leaving. I stayed in Aurobindo's ashram for as long as half a month. Every day, besides reading, I discussed philosophical questions about the sacredness of life with Aurobindo's major disciples, such as N.K. Gupat, Pavitala S.K. Mlilra, Nirada Ray, and Purani. I also first used the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties in our country to explain that Indian philosophy can be combined with the enlightenment of Yoga. First, one understands the truth, and then one understands the usual principles. Chinese philosophy attempts to experience the truth from the midst of principles. Although the methods are different, the ultimate goal is the same. The Buddha said that the truth of the universe is only one, but sentient beings see it differently. The theory of the sacredness of life created by Aurobindo is a major school in the modern idealistic school, regarded by Indians as the reincarnation of a great sage from two thousand years ago, the soul of the Indian Renaissance. In the past, the poet Tagore wrote a poem after visiting Aurobindo: "Aurobindo, may he receive my respectful bow! Today I see you, all wisdom. When I see you again in the future, I will have no words to sing of! May he receive my respectful bow!" The French literary giant Romain Rolland also said: "Aurobindo combines and harmonizes European and Asian philosophies and cultures." His admiration can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The ashram has a library, a bank, a factory, a hospital, and a small elementary school attached to it. The students, over a hundred people, are all children of the monks in the ashram, mainly studying English, French, and Indian languages, with other sciences secondary. The library has hundreds of thousands of books, mostly in English, French, and Indian languages, and publishes a quarterly magazine called "Descent," which serves as a writing platform for the disciples. Pondicherry is the capital of French India, with a governor's mansion and a high court. The University of Paris also has a liberal arts college here. I visited the liberal arts college, which had several hundred students, and the lectures were all in French. The law school is attached to the High Court. There is also a medical school, but I did not visit it because I am not familiar with medicine. The local Indians can all speak French, but not English. All the store signs are written in both French and Tamil. I spoke with the registrar of the liberal arts college, asking if graduates of Chinese schools could directly enter the college. He replied that if they knew French, they could, otherwise they would have to take a year of remedial courses. I found my stay in Pondicherry quite comfortable, but due to pressing school matters, I could not stay for long. Therefore, on May 5th, I took a train back to Madras. That evening, before leaving Pondicherry, I bid farewell to The Mother and expressed my aspirations and plans for the sacredness of life in the future, and I was given full instructions and permission. All my friends in the ashram saw me off at the station. The train departed at 9:00 PM, and I arrived safely in Madras at 7:00 AM the next morning. The next day, my Indian friend Seth Saman came and accompanied me to visit the University of Madras. The university is located on the coast, with a beautiful scenery and dozens of buildings, among which the Provincial College is the largest. Unfortunately, the school was on summer vacation, so I could not visit in detail, only browsing through the library. The library has millions of books, including over one hundred thousand on Indian philosophy. However, there was only one book on Chinese philosophy, the Laozi's Daodejing (English translation). Foreigners who want to study Chinese culture are hindered by language and writing. Scholars in our country who are proficient in both Chinese literature and history and foreign languages are very few, so we cannot transplant our culture abroad, which is a great pity. I met Professor Gosber of Negpo University at the hotel, and we had a very pleasant discussion on yoga philosophy. Then, we took a train together to the city of Tiruvannamalai to see the master Ramana.</p>
<p>(5) Meeting the Zen Master</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM that evening, the train departed from Madras, and I arrived in Tiruvannamalai the next morning. The area is mountainous, and the climate is very hot. One cannot step outside the door in the afternoon. I was confined to my room, and it only felt cool in the evening. After arriving in Tiruvannamalai, Professor Gosber and I stayed at the home of Dr. D. Roy. Dr. Roy is a famous professor at the University of Madras, who recently retired to the countryside due to old age and is studying Sunya Yoga (what the Chinese call esoteric studies) under Ramana. When I visited the master Ramana, I presented fresh flowers and fruit as an offering. Seeing me, he smiled, nodded in response, and instructed me to sit on the floor. The master sat on the bed, silently entering into meditation. Ramana had established an ashram himself at the foot of Mount Arunachala. There were nearly a hundred people practicing the Dao in the ashram. He and his disciples sat together in the same room day and night, eating together in the same room. He wore only a pair of shorts, carried a staff, and had nothing else. He and his disciples did not transmit through spoken or written words, but through the direct transmission from mind to mind. If someone asked how to begin Zen meditation, he would say, "Who are you?" The implication is that our current body is not the true self, but a false self. If we can find the true self, then this true self is God, as large as the universe, united with heaven and earth. Therefore, the teachings of the master Ramana are the true transmission of the Dharma Ancestor, whose arrival in China formed the Zen sect, a separate transmission outside the scriptures. If we want to find the true self, we must break through our ego, reach a state of no-self, and not stain anything in our hearts. The ancient Buddha said, "The wild goose flies obliquely across the pond, leaving its reflection, the reflection fades, yet the bottom remains crystal clear." Then, seeing anything, we will see life, see the heart of heaven. "The stream's body is everywhere the broad and long tongue, the mountain's color is nothing but the pure body." Du Fu's saying, "Casually recognize the face of the east wind, ten thousand purples and thousands of reds are all spring" also means seeing the heart of heaven. The master Ramana is sixty-four years old this year, his hair and beard already white. He left home at the age of sixteen. At that time, he was participating in an admission test at the University of Madras when he suddenly became enlightened. He then abandoned his family and sat in a mountain cave for eighteen years. After his merits were fulfilled, he began to descend the mountain to teach his disciples, establishing an ashram in Tiruvannamalai. Today, the Indians call him the great saint Maha Rishi. I have portraits of Ramana and Sri Aurobindo in India, which shows the Indians' admiration for them. I stayed in Ramana's ashram for a total of four days, sitting with the master in the same room day and night. Although I did not attain enlightenment, I also learned a little about intellectual wisdom. There are many miraculous events related to the master Ramana and Sri Aurobindo, but ordinary people may criticize them as unscientific, so I will not describe them.</p>
<p>On May 15th, I returned to Madras, where I received a warm welcome from the local overseas Chinese. I am grateful from the bottom of my heart. On the 19th, I returned safely to Calcutta. In summary, this trip to South India covered tens of thousands of miles and lasted for a month. Visiting the two major contemporary philosophers of India, strengthened my confidence in the study of settling the heart and establishing life, and made my desire to serve humanity even firmer. After returning to Calcutta, I convened all the colleagues and students of the Chinese School to give a lecture on this trip and concluded:</p>
<p>(1) It is not impossible for human beings to transform from ordinary to sacred, and there are methods that can be followed, depending on the strength of our minds and determination.</p>
<p>(2) The strength of a country depends on what its national mind and talent are focused on.</p>
<p>(3) We must make great vows and generate great compassion, and work for the peaceful future of the world's humanity.</p>
<p>I recall that when I was young, I recited Mr. Liang's thirtieth birthday poem from Xinhui, "The world is infinite, the wishes are endless, the sea and sky are vast, standing for a long time." The ambition soared, unstoppable. Now I am willing to share these words with the scholars to study together and see every Sanskrit classic and encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Hunan Tea and Tung Oil: A Precipitous Decline <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli reports from Changsha on the 20th of this month</p>
<p>China is an agricultural nation, and Hunan can be considered a representative of agricultural society. While grains and miscellaneous cereals are Hunan's primary produce, its secondary products, tea and tung oil, undoubtedly occupy a crucial position in the province's rural economy. Rural prosperity certainly depends on abundant harvests of grains and cereals, but sluggish sales of tea and tung oil are also sufficient to contribute to the decline of Hunan's rural areas.</p>
<p>Tea-Producing Areas: 64 Counties</p>
<p>Although Hunan's agriculture in the past eight years has been barely satisfactory, it has seen bumper harvests every year except last year. However, Hunan has been most affected by the enemy's blockade policy, which has prevented the export of its tea and tung oil, directly reducing rural income. The rampant and devastating famine of the past six months, while seemingly a matter of starvation, is inextricably linked to this issue.</p>
<p>Tea-producing areas in Hunan account for 64 out of the province's 76 counties. The 17 counties of Linxiang, Anhua, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, Taoyuan, Xinhua, Chen County, Yueyang, Changsha, Shimen, Cili, Xiangxiang, Yuanling, Ling County, Shaoyang, and Wugang have the highest and most famous production. Their total output ranks third in the country. In terms of quality, Anhua's black tea and brick tea, and Linxiang's dark brick tea, are the most renowned, with sales markets extending both domestically and abroad. Brick tea is particularly essential for the Soviet Union. In recent years, due to traffic congestion during the war, sales have been extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned products, Anhua tea deserves the most attention. Anhua is located in the central part of the Zishui River basin, and the entire county is suitable for tea cultivation. Production also occurs in various places along the Zishui River basin outside of Anhua. Millions of farmers rely on this for a living, with Anhua being the main production and distribution center. Tea is divided into five types: first, black tea, also known as "Yin Tea." This was established when Zuo Zongtang quelled the New Province and requested the adoption of a system similar to salt licenses, where merchants would contract to manage and sell the tea, transporting it to the Northwest, and calling it "Yin Tea." Second, red tea, known in the international market as "Xianghong." Third, green tea. Fourth, brick tea. Except for a portion of green tea used locally in Hunan Province, the other types are almost entirely exported. Statistics show that from the 27th year of Guangxu to the 4th year of the Republic (1901-1915), red tea had an average annual output of 40,000 boxes, but its quality was inferior to Keemun tea, making it difficult to compete with Anhui tea, leading to a precipitous decline. After 1943, annual production was only 2,000 boxes.</p>
<p>Black Tea: Essential in the Northwest</p>
<p>Black tea is essential for people in the Northwest, much like salt is an indispensable food item for us. Therefore, its sales are extremely brisk. In prosperous years, production could reach 2,000 licenses, approximately 120,000 dan. In ordinary years, it would produce 1,200 licenses, equivalent to over 70,000 dan. In 1941, production was only 17,400 dan. Although it increased by 23,851 dan in 1942, the entire amount was purchased by the China Tea Company. After 1943, due to transportation issues, no one purchased black tea, and its production became even smaller. Anhua still has 100 tons of inventory that has not been shipped out. An additional 300 tons have been transported to Hankou, Yiyang, and Zhengzhou, but have not been sold, leading tea merchants to hesitate to continue production.</p>
<p>Brick Tea: Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>Brick tea is a recent invention. It is essentially black tea that has been pressed into bricks for ease of transportation. Its primary customers are the Soviets. With the establishment of the Sino-Soviet barter agreement, the tea industry revived. Wuhan became an important commercial port for the transshipment of Hunan tea. The government monopolized the purchase and sale of tea to earn foreign exchange. Thus, the Hunan Brick Tea Factory of the Central Trust Bureau's Barter Division was established. The factory was originally the Tea Management Office of the Hunan Construction Department. In 1941, it was renamed the Provincial Brick Tea Factory. In 1942, it partnered with the China Tea Company and was renamed the Hunan Brick Tea Factory of the China Tea Company. After the China Tea Company was merged and then split from the company, it did not resume operations. Another tea factory, the Hunan Provincial Tea Factory, was reorganized from the Anhua Tea Farm of the Agricultural Improvement Institute. These two factories were government-operated. Private tea factories are scattered throughout Dongping, Huangshaping, and other areas of Anhua County. The more famous ones include the Xinyi Company Anhua Tea Factory, Liangyi Tea Factory, and Huaan Company, which produce red and green tea and use small wooden brick presses to produce one-jin brick tea. However, their resources are not as strong as the government-operated tea factories, resulting in limited production.</p>
<p>Tea Farmers: Livelihoods in Jeopardy</p>
<p>The situation in the Anhua tea region is roughly as described above. As for the plight of the tea farmers, it is even more unimaginable. Tea farmers value their tea forests as much as they value their fields. Before the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy, tea farmers would bring their harvested tea to the market and sell it freely, without experiencing much suffering. However, after the unified purchase and sale policy was implemented, the tea prices were fixed, but tea farmers could not directly trade with the China Tea Company and had to go through intermediaries. As a result, the tea farmers' income was insufficient to cover the cost of fertilizers and labor. Later, when sales channels were cut off and no one was buying, their suffering became even more unbearable. Near Anhua, many tea farmers were tempted to use their tea trees for firewood and charcoal. This year, with the end of the war, the tea industry could have been expected to recover, but it has been hampered by foreign exchange restrictions, making exports impossible and hindering its revival.</p>
<p>The government's lack of comprehensive relief measures for the tea industry has also contributed to its decline. Although the Construction Department has approved a tea loan of 100 million yuan, it is only intended to alleviate the stagnation of Anhua's tea inventory, and it does not greatly benefit the tea farmers. According to Mr. Peng Xianze, the director of the Hunan Brick Tea Factory, Hunan tea is indeed of high quality, but poor production methods have made it impossible to compete in the international market, which is a pity. If the government could provide substantial loan relief and encourage exports, it might not be able to replace Ceylon tea, but it could still occupy a place in the international tea market, and tea farmers would indirectly benefit from the large-scale export of tea.</p>
<p>Tung Oil: Reduced Production</p>
<p>Tung oil is a unique product of China and also a specialty of Hunan. According to the customs trade records, from the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) to the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the export volume of Hunan tung oil increased from 227 dan to 600,000 dan. However, comparing the 600,000 dan in 1941 with the 533,000 dan in 1929, the actual production has not increased but decreased.</p>
<p>The reason for the reduced production is not that the government has not promoted and encouraged it. In fact, the government has achieved considerable success in planting. In the spring of 1936, the government established four memorial forests in Lingling, Nanyue, and Yueyang, and ordered the Provincial Highway Bureau to plant tung trees along both sides of the highways, and formulated a plan for planting tung trees in townships and villages in Hunan Province. Using cooperative methods, each township was given seeds and 2,000 yuan of provincial bank funding, with a plan to plant 3,000 tung trees in 1940 and increase the planting by 1,000 to 2,000 trees each year thereafter. This shows the active promotion of tung tree planting in Hunan.</p>
<p>Tung Forests: Distribution</p>
<p>The distribution of tung forests in Hunan is mainly in western Hunan, followed by southern Hunan. Tung oil produced along the Yuan River basin in western Hunan accounts for 60% of the province's total. Yuanling County alone produces 50,000 dan annually. In total, the counties along the Yuan River produce over 370,000 dan annually. The Xiang River basin accounts for 16% of the province's total, with a total annual production of about 100,000 dan. The Zi and Feng Rivers also have a small amount of annual production, mostly three-year-old tung trees.</p>
<p>In August 1936, the government began to improve tung oil pressing methods in order to compete in the foreign market. It established vegetable oil factories in various places to improve quality, which achieved great results. The export volume of Hunan tung oil also increased daily, and the tung oil industry flourished. However, good times did not last. In 1937, the war broke out, and there was no way to export. The Ministry of Finance's Reconstruction Company was responsible for unified purchase and sale. When the Burma Road was cut off, the Reconstruction Company also stopped purchasing, and tung oil changed from export to domestic sales. In the country, in addition to being used for lighting, it was once used to refine gasoline, but the cost was too high, and it could not be developed.</p>
<p>Exports: Not Hopeless</p>
<p>After the end of the war, the dream of exporting tung oil still could not be realized. Tung oil stagnated in the production areas, accumulating like mountains. On the one hand, there were no sales channels, and on the other hand, the disaster was severe, and many farmers gave up harvesting, allowing the tung fruit to rot. As a result, production in western Hunan has almost fallen to half of what it used to be.</p>
<p>But is there hope for exporting tung oil? Have American substitutes replaced the position of tung oil? The answer is: there is still hope. According to the Business Daily, "After the lifting of tung oil consumption controls after the war, the maximum consumption in the United States can still reach 100 million pounds per year, so the United States is still a market for our country's tung oil."</p>
<p>Tung Trees: Crisis Lurks</p>
<p>However, even if there is a large foreign market, without government support, it will still be impossible to export. The cost is high, and the freight is large. The price of tung oil in Changsha is 40,000 yuan per dan, and the freight from Changsha to Shanghai is 30,000 yuan per dan. The freight and import tax from Shanghai to the United States increase the cost to over 80,000 yuan per dan. However, the American market price is 35 cents per pound, which is 70,000 yuan per dan. This means that merchants who ship to the United States for sale must incur a loss of about 10,000 yuan per dan, with no profit at all. Merchants are reluctant to proceed, and the government has no policy to subsidize this difference. How can a large-scale export be achieved? The most affected are still the tung farmers. Some say that if this continues, tung trees will disappear in China in a few years. Although this may be an exaggeration, it shows the magnitude of the crisis.</p>
<p>The vegetable oil factories in Hunan are planning to improve the quality and utilization of tung oil. They have ordered a large number of oil presses from the United States. Currently, the Changde factory can press 20 tons of oil per month. They hope to use a portion of the tung oil to manufacture paint and soap. However, this is still a temporary solution. If a fundamental solution is not sought, the crisis will still exist.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Emergency Report from Songjiang Reader: Cholera Rampant, Deaths Soaring <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Solutions to Emergency Aid Problems, Answered Quickly by This Newspaper's Advisor</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Greetings. Since true cholera began spreading in our town last month, the affected area has gradually expanded. Although patients have received treatment from Western doctors, early injections of appropriate amounts of saline and cardiac stimulants, oral anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals, and absorbent remedies, very few have recovered. The majority of patients experience a gradual return of body temperature and pulse after saline injections, only to suffer a relapse after two or three hours, leading to an irreversible state and a shockingly high mortality rate of approximately 80% or more! Having read in the newspapers that the mortality rate of cholera in Shanghai is only below 20%, the difference is so vast. Currently, the villagers have lost faith in Western medicine, and Chinese medicine offers no solution. Upon discovering the disease, they simply resign themselves to fate and await death helplessly, which is truly tragic! Driven by compassion, I have specially recorded a few questions and respectfully request that you take the time to inquire at Shanghai hospitals or specialist physicians regarding the details of cholera treatment, including the medications used, and publish them in the newspaper so that physicians in epidemic areas can refer to and adopt them to save the sinking and reduce the mortality rate. This would be a truly immeasurable act of merit.</p>
<p>The questions are listed below, please answer them separately:</p>
<p>(1) Symptomatic Treatment: What are the effective treatments for vomiting and diarrhea? (Vomiting is truly dreadful; even medications are vomited upon entry, preventing them from having any effect. Are there any special injectable medications that can stop vomiting, allowing medications to be administered? Diarrhea is also terrible; after two or three major bouts of diarrhea, dehydration symptoms appear. Common absorbents like charcoal are completely ineffective. Please publish effective anti-diarrheal prescriptions for physicians to use.)</p>
<p>(2) Etiological Treatment: Which bactericidal agents are most effective? Which ones are used in Shanghai?</p>
<p>(3) Plasma Injections: Are plasma or blood protein injections more effective than saline injections, and how much should be injected? How much does 500 cc cost?</p>
<p>(4) How should cholera-induced acidosis be treated?</p>
<p>(5) What diuretic medications are appropriate for cholera patients who also suffer from urinary retention?</p>
<p>Awaiting publication or reply, with respectful greetings,</p>
<p>Lu Xibai, Songyin, Songjiang</p>
<p>Answer from Medical Doctor Tang Renjin</p>
<p>The reasons why Shanghai cholera patients have a lower mortality rate are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Upon discovery, patients are immediately sent to epidemic hospitals for emergency treatment. (2) There are numerous epidemic isolation hospitals throughout the city, staffed by experts day and night, with ample supplies of medications and equipment. (3) Transportation is convenient. Rural areas lack epidemic hospitals, or if they exist, they are poorly equipped. Patients lack regular medical care. Upon discovering cholera, they often first try scraping, take herbal remedies, and seek divine intervention, resulting in delayed treatment and lost opportunities. Here are my answers to the five questions:</p>
<p>(1) For vomiting and diarrhea, morphine is commonly injected, or tincture of opium is taken orally, and ice cubes are held in the mouth. (2) Sulfa-Guanidine can be taken orally. (3) For plasma injections, Shanghai uses mostly American products (originally named Human Plasma). Each 500 cc bottle costs approximately 30 US dollars, equivalent to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in national currency. (4) Acidosis is caused by a lack of water in the body after vomiting and diarrhea. To prevent it, an alkaline solution containing glucose is usually injected first (commercially available as Locke's solution), followed by physiological saline or Ringer's solution. This can quickly take effect and avoid acidosis. (5) Urinary retention is closely related to the prognosis of the disease. Therefore, in treatment, the importance of diuretics and cardiac stimulants is no less than saline injections. According to a report by Rumqe, the mortality rate for those with complete anuria is 57.2%. For those without urinary retention, it is only 4.7%. Common diuretic and cardiac stimulants, such as Caffeine, S.B, Digalin, Sol, Camphor, Hexeton, Aoramin, Diuretin, Urotropin, Strophautin, etc., can be taken orally or injected.</p>
<p>My opinion:</p>
<p>(1) Universal and mandatory cholera vaccinations should be implemented. (2) Cholera vibrios are generally present in the feces and vomit of patients. The main vehicle of transmission is water, as the patient's excrement mixes with the water in wells and rivers. Your area does not have running water. If patients' clothes and items contaminated with excrement are washed in the river or near wells, and even rice is washed and vegetables are cleaned in the same place, it is extremely easy to transmit the disease. Flies are also a major carrier. Therefore, local enlightened people must advise the public to pay attention to the above points to prevent future problems. DDT can be used for fly control. Drinks should be boiled. Do not eat raw or cold fruits and vegetables, or food that flies have landed on. Bleach and lime can be added to raw water. (3) The excrement of patients must be disinfected with concentrated lime, and clothes and utensils should also be boiled for disinfection.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Striving for World Peace: How to Overcome the Seven Hurdles? Success Depends on the Power of the Peace Conference <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Translated and abridged by Junmo</p>
<p>The first post-war peace conference has already opened in Paris. Since the end of the war, the world has been trembling under an atmosphere of tension. Will humanity head towards an even more terrifying war? Will human wisdom be able to win tomorrow's peace and civilization? The renowned British historian and Oxford University Professor of International Relations, Professor Weihua Te, believes that the fate of world civilization depends on how we deal with the following seven major challenges today.</p>
<p>The war has passed, but it is really hard to say whether we have truly won, because we have not yet escaped the post-victory danger period. Whether the peace and culture of tomorrow's world can be maintained depends on whether we can solve the seven main factors most closely related to it today:</p>
<p>(1) Famine, Material and Psychological Upheaval</p>
<p>The first issue, or rather the first set of issues, is the material and psychological devastation left behind after the war. Famine has spread throughout the world, and a hungry world is unable to maintain a peaceful order. Not only that, but due to a lack of machinery, productivity has greatly decreased; due to a lack of housing, the foundation of healthy family life has been damaged; and the decline in material life inevitably leads to a decline in spiritual life. In war, the only training is in destruction and slaughter. How should we bring this deviation from the standards of civilized life back to the moral standards of love and affection between people? This is a very important matter.</p>
<p>(2) The German Question</p>
<p>This matter is a dilemma. If we forever suppress them with force, then six million people with a high degree of civilization will live a semi-primitive, non-industrialized life for a long time, which will leave Europe in poverty forever. Moreover, the existence of such a factor will make it difficult to establish a sound and stable Europe. But if we help Germany to recover, it may well turn around and try to conquer Europe by force again. The Germans' thinking has not changed as much as we had hoped. History tells us that the recovery of a defeated country is faster in modern times. This requires very careful handling.</p>
<p>(3) The Rise of the Slavic People</p>
<p>A prominent feature of post-war Europe is the resurgence of the Slavic people. The importance of this fact is no less than the succession of maritime powers in the 16th and 17th centuries to colonial countries in the 18th century, and then to industrial countries in the 19th century. The resurgence of the Slavic people in Europe certainly does not mean that any serious and profound conflict will occur between Britain and the Soviet Union. In terms of resources, the Soviet Union should not look to expand further in Europe, but currently, there are two places that could cause problems: one is in Greece, and the other is in Norway. The Norwegian problem may be even more important, especially for the United States.</p>
<p>(4) New World Strategy</p>
<p>New warfare methods have brought a new political situation to this post-war world. The Mediterranean has lost its importance for Far East navigation, which means that maritime hegemony alone is useless. The defense of Gibraltar is of little value today, and Malta is no longer of much use either. Currently, for Europe, the harbors and bases of East Africa are far more important than the Suez Canal. Because of this relationship, Britain is more concerned about the future of the Italian colony of Somaliland.</p>
<p>Arctic traffic is also one of the issues on which countries have focused their attention after the war. Alaska and the Kamchatka Peninsula have become strategic locations, because in terms of the distance between states, traffic via the Arctic is much closer than via the Antarctic.</p>
<p>(5) The Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>The atomic bomb has changed the entire world's strategic geography and threatens the civilization of all mankind. But this is not just a problem of loss of life, because the Black Death in the 14th century destroyed a third of the entire population of Western Europe, and it was not seen to curb European civilization thereafter. But the atomic bomb is different. Its destructive impact is mainly the long failure to restore the ordered life of mankind, so that civilization remains for a long time at a stationary point that is difficult to advance. We must understand that the cities that are currently the most densely populated, the most industrialized, and therefore the most vulnerable to atomic bombs, are also the leaders of today's world civilization.</p>
<p>(6) The Clash of Ideas</p>
<p>The result of every major war makes us feel that it is a failure of one political system and a victory of another political system. This war is clearly a failure of the German and Italian dictatorships and a victory of Western democratic and liberal politics. But as we say this, we cannot help but feel a contradiction: the Soviet Union is a country with a completely totalitarian system, in other words, it is another type of dictatorship. Currently, in large areas of Europe, the atmosphere of political freedom has disappeared, and one-party dictatorship is on the rise again. On the one hand, there is the totalitarian ideology of Marxism, and on the other hand, there is the liberal ideology of the middle class. These two trends form one of the most important psychological conflicts in the world today.</p>
<p>(7) The Need to Change</p>
<p>It is not easy to stop the spread of this totalitarian trend, because the people of the world need a thorough change in social and economic order, and this is an undeniable fact. For a long time, our culture has been built on poverty and inequality, but currently, due to human control over natural resources, this era should be over. Our current problem is how to guide human control over nature towards a correct goal.</p>

<h3 id="e136">American Liberal Faction Actively Advocates Friendship with the Soviet Union – Translated by Jia Nan from Life Magazine <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The postwar foreign policy of the United States, with its significant implications, has become the focus of global attention. Within the United States, opinions on this crucial issue are also sharply divided. The stances of the Truman-Byrnes faction and the Wallace faction differ considerably, even to the point of deep conflict. We can gauge the severity of these conflicts by examining the following facts.</p>
<p>Even before the war ended, American military authorities believed that in this era of rapidly emerging new weapons, the United States must retain its outlying bases in the Atlantic until international organizations could maintain lasting peace. Among these bases, Iceland was considered the most essential. Therefore, in October of last year, we requested a 99-year lease of wartime bases from the Icelandic government, while assuring them that once a comprehensive security mechanism was established within the United Nations, the bases would be transferred to the management of the Allied nations. The Icelandic people are a proud and independent nation, and the American Minister to Iceland, Mr. [Lincoln] MacVeagh, worked diligently to negotiate, ensuring that the proposed lease would not infringe upon Icelandic sovereignty and, to demonstrate goodwill, pledged to help Iceland join the United Nations as a member. By March of this year, an agreement seemed highly promising.</p>
<p>In late March, Secretary of Commerce Wallace suddenly became involved in this international stage, small in scale but large in consequence. He held a press conference, sternly criticizing the continued presence of American troops in Iceland as inappropriate and firmly stating that the Soviet Union would inevitably perceive this action as anti-Soviet. Subsequently, Senator Pepper delivered an important speech, supporting Wallace. In mid-April, a "Conference for Peace" was convened in the auditorium of the Commerce Department, attended by prominent liberals such as Senator Kilgore and Representative Celler. They reiterated that the American plan to establish overseas bases carried aggressive and anti-Soviet implications, vehemently demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland. These developments led the Icelandic government to reconsider establishing bases during peacetime.</p>
<p>Byrnes</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Wallace Faction's Disorganized Steps <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The attitude of the Icelandic people may change again. However, if they remain steadfast, and the day comes when our country needs outlying bases in the Atlantic, then Wallace, Pepper, and their supporters will have reason to regret it. We do not doubt Wallace's noble motives, nor can we assert that the plan to establish overseas bases is definitively correct. However, one point is worth noting: this plan is a policy jointly formulated by the American government, approved by the President and various advisors. Wallace, in an irresponsible manner, interfered in a highly sensitive and important matter, ultimately overturning the policy of his own government. He certainly has the right to express his opinions, but if he cannot convince his colleagues in cabinet meetings, then the only course of action is to resign or remain silent. Wallace did not do this, instead adopting what appears to be an unorthodox approach. From this, we can see how disorganized the steps of American liberalism, as represented by the Wallace faction, have become.</p>
<p>What is the cause of this disarray? The answer is simple: it lies in the liberal faction's attitude toward the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's large-scale experiments in social and economic planning, as well as its inspiring achievements in resisting Germany, have deeply moved the liberal faction's imagination. As the war ended, American liberals had formed an idealized picture of the Soviet Union in their minds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resilient and capable leaders of the Soviet Union are not liberal idealists but realists. Unlike most liberals, they understand that power is the fundamental factor in all politics. After the war ended, they embarked on an expansionist policy. This inevitably makes us wonder if the Soviet Union will ever be satisfied before it has completely controlled Europe and Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Soviet Realism Is Not Easily Reversed <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>However, liberals will not judge in this way. They often conflate the realistic aspects of Soviet policy with their imagined, idealized picture of the Soviet Union. Some of them believe that the Soviet Union's "Realpolitik" can be reversed through sincere and loving attitudes; others think that Soviet policies are not necessarily worse than old-style British imperialism, as if a mother were forgiving her children's behavior. We find these painstaking justifications deeply painful, because in 1937, 1938, and 1939, we heard similar arguments. In fact, if a political movement cannot adapt to the needs of the times, it risks losing its power. Our most pressing need is to organize a stable, prosperous, and peaceful world, but those who are unwilling and afraid to face reality head-on cannot achieve anything in this regard. This is the tragedy of American liberalism.</p>
<p>Many people often like to speculate, what policies would President Roosevelt have adopted if he were alive today? In fact, spending too much effort in this area is of little significance, but one point is very clear: Roosevelt, on the one hand, strived to engage with the Soviet Union with sincerity, while on the other hand, maintained the United States' firm stance. We can say that the policies currently being pursued by Secretary of State Byrnes bear traces of Roosevelt's approach. The path currently being taken by the United States in international politics has the following points: (1) Fully supporting the United Nations organization, enabling it to solve various problems in the world; (2) Placing terrible new weapons under the control of the United Nations and implementing disarmament under the guidance of the United Nations; (3) Dealing with the Soviet Union with a firmer attitude, preventing its continuous expansion; (4) Making the greatest efforts to carry out relief and reconstruction work in various parts of the world, because famine and poverty can create political vacuums, inducing the Soviet Union to engage in new adventures. However, one point worth explaining is that the basic content of this thinking is not to go to war with the Soviet Union but to remove the dangers of war, improve the world situation, and allow the United States and the Soviet Union to coexist peacefully. After the Soviet Union's leaders experience this firm policy of the United States, they will understand that competing with the United States is meaningless, and then concentrate on domestic development, and treat all nations of the United Nations equally. Time can eliminate suspicion and dissent, and finally obtain the beautiful fruits of peace.</p>

<h3 id="e139">India's Independence: The First Major Hurdle Is Overcome <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Jun Mo from a United Press International Special Feature</p>
<p>Under the guidance and assistance of Great Britain, India is taking its first steps toward independence. There will naturally be many obstacles ahead for the Indian people to overcome in order to truly become masters of their own destiny, but the first major hurdle has finally been overcome. Great Britain sent a cabinet delegation to India, bringing with it a plan drafted by the British government, hoping to guide India step-by-step toward independence. After several discussions with various Indian political parties, the plan has finally been accepted by the major parties, primarily the Indian National Congress (representing Hindus), the Muslim League (representing Muslims), and various princely states. The plan is a moderate transformation in nature, requiring agreement among all parties and classes. In July, all parties will elect representatives to form a constituent assembly. The assembly is scheduled to convene on August 1st to draft a new constitution. Once the new constitution is drafted, it must be sent to London for approval by the House of Commons.</p>
<p>This new constitution must conform to the outline and principles of the British-proposed independence plan, especially ensuring the protection of India's minority groups, particularly the 96 million Muslims. At the same time, the constitution must also stipulate that India should enter into a treaty with Great Britain. In addition, the constitution should also stipulate the formation of a federation, with the federal center responsible for the country's foreign affairs, defense, and transportation, and having the power to collect taxes to fund the aforementioned administration. The federal center should have an executive body to preside over it, and a legislative assembly representing the current British India and the princely states. All powers not belonging to the federal center should remain with the individual states.</p>
<p>This all-India federal center will replace Great Britain as the de facto supreme authority in India. Once the constitution is passed, Great Britain will enter into a permanent defense agreement with India, granting Great Britain certain special rights to protect India and maintain imperial communications. It is currently impossible to estimate how long it will take for the Indian people to draft such a constitution. However, it is not an easy task; due to various difficulties, it may take months or even years to complete.</p>

<p>Today's Europe is tired, hungry, and filled with devastation. Over the past few months, I have traveled all over Europe, and the impression I have gained is that the people of Europe today need food, clothing, shelter, and relief from political tensions. Most people are deeply disappointed by the slow pace of reconstruction. They yearn for the days of pre-war peace and prosperity to return soon. Many hope for a vacation where they can relax in sunny places. Others want to read the books, magazines, and newspapers they have not been able to see for many years. Millions of people have returned to religion. Sales of religious publications have exceeded pre-war levels by three or four times, and churches are packed with worshippers, even in Germany and the Soviet Union. The desire for recreation and entertainment is extremely high. Theaters and entertainment venues are more bustling than ever before. Movie theaters are packed to capacity at every showing. In London and many European countries, theater tickets often need to be reserved two or three months in advance. Any mediocre play can run for a long time and is guaranteed to be sold out. Everyone eagerly anticipates the arrival of new American films. Many countries are still showing old Hollywood movies that are five or even ten years old. People are trying to escape reality everywhere. Europeans today do not think about things like diplomacy. The great power politics of the world have disheartened most people. They would rather think about their own stomachs, the shoes on their feet, and the bread, meat, and potatoes that their families are clamoring for.</p>
<p>Waiting in long lines for trains and buses, workers and civil servants complain that everything is still rationed, and some daily necessities are even scarcer than during the war.</p>
<p>Fortunately, apart from the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Finland, Norway, and other countries, Europe has generally not experienced widespread famine. However, six years of war have affected people's entire lives. Lung disease is alarmingly common, and children in particular are suffering from disease, with mortality rates rising dramatically.</p>
<p>A year ago, everyone feared plagues, bloody civil wars, and widespread strikes. But now, it seems that these may be avoided. On the whole, the situation in Europe may be slightly better than most people had predicted.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Atomic Bomb: Is It Really Powerful? A Fair Description of the Test <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Jun Mo</p>
<p>After the first atomic bomb test at Bikini, many people were quite disappointed, feeling that the power of the atomic bomb did not seem as great as imagined, because most of the ships did not sink, and many of the animals used for the test were still alive. They had hoped that one bomb would explode and create "a vast expanse of whiteness, truly clean." In fact, what is the correct assessment of this test? The following is a fair assessment from Mr. Lindley, a columnist for U.S. News &amp; World Report, who personally inspected the scene.</p>
<p>The assessment of the results of this atomic bomb test must depend on three things: First, to what extent were your prior expectations; second, how closely did you inspect the damage to the ships and animals; and third, how much do you really know about the effects of radiation?</p>
<p>Currently, many reports about the damage are based only on observations made from a distance or from the air shortly after the explosion. They are not yet very clear about radiation and the actual extent of the damage. From the air, the Nevada was still floating on the surface of the water, and many of the palm trees and animals on the ship were still unharmed. All of this was initially disappointing. Even I myself, when I flew over the area after the explosion and saw this scene, could not help but feel disappointed. But when the plane flew lower, and you could clearly see the twisted iron plates and the masts and gun barrels that had been bombed, your confidence in the atomic bomb would be restored considerably. When you left the plane and boarded a small boat to inspect the ships closely, your respect for the atomic bomb would be even stronger.</p>
<p>All of this is just the damage that is visible at a glance. The effects of radiation have not yet been taken into account. These will have to be determined by experts after they have studied the damaged ships and animals. What will be the consequences of radiation exposure on the inside of animals or the human body? To what extent does radiation penetrate the ship's hull, and how does it affect the crew? Because if the crew is injured or killed, the fleet is useless even if it does not sink.</p>
<p>After considering all of these things, we must also remember that this was just one atomic bomb exploding in the air above a large fleet. If more atomic bombs were dropped in a real war, or if they exploded underwater, the situation would of course be very different.</p>
<p>We must especially understand that our cities, houses, and factories are not as strong as warships, which are all made of steel plates. Cities and factories are the ideal targets for atomic bombs. In any case, it is still the most terrifying weapon of destruction that mankind has ever created. We simply cannot imagine what a country would become if it were subjected to a sudden atomic bomb attack.</p>

<p>1. "Balloon Bombs"</p>
<p>The most inept "new weapon" of this war was probably the "balloon bomb" invented by Japan. They spent 18,000,000 U.S. dollars on research, created 9,000 of them, and launched them to attack the United States. Only 283 reached the northern United States, one of which was picked up by a child in Oregon, who played with it. It exploded, killing six people.</p>
<p>2. Rich People Are Often Stingy</p>
<p>The Maharaja of Hyderabad in India is one of the richest people in the world. His wealth amounts to 2,500,000,000 U.S. dollars, and his annual income, after all expenses, is 15,000,000 U.S. dollars. But he is incredibly stingy. He limits his daily allowance to no more than five dollars, but in fact, he never spends that much each day.</p>

<p>— Xie Shuiying</p>
<p>Foreword: Hankou is unbearably hot. When I try to write something, before I can write a hundred words, sweat drips onto the paper like raindrops, so I have to put down my pen and read a book, because while reading, I can still use my right hand to fan myself. However, after reading, I want to write something again, to record my thoughts or experiences. I hope to introduce several writers, especially those who became famous during the war. I haven't read much of Saroyan's work, but I admire his spirit of perseverance and struggle the most. – Bingying's postscript</p>
<p>William Saroyan is one of the new American writers. He is only thirty-eight years old this year, but he has become a first-rate American writer. In his plays and novels, he breaks literary conventions. Although his works sometimes inevitably feel crude, they are very elegant in terms of taste. Although he will not follow established rules, he still has his own style.</p>
<p>Saroyan was born in 1908. When he was two years old, his father died, and his family was very poor, so his mother had to send him to an orphanage. It was not until he was seven years old that she found a better job at a cannery and brought Saroyan home again. However, when William was thirteen or fourteen years old, he began to support himself: he worked as a messenger for a telegraph office and as a newspaper reporter. From this time on, he began to write novels. At the age of sixteen, he went to work in his uncle's vineyard, so he was very familiar with the life there. Later, he often used it as the background in his novels. The following year, he left home and went to other places.</p>
<p>In many of Saroyan's articles, he reflects on his childhood. He brings the realities of society onto his stage, such as rural areas, cafes in New York, small towns in the West, and even the deserts. In the novel "Locomotive 38," he describes the story of his youth and a wealthy man, which is very interesting. Saroyan has always chosen this simple and beautiful background as the basis for his writing. This is of course due to his keen observation and his ability to see through the entire society. He does not pay attention to how to polish or refine his work, but he has a unique, unadorned beauty that is vivid and profound.</p>
<p>His first collection of novels, "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze," was highly praised by the literary world. Since the publication of this work, his reputation has grown. In 1939, he began to write plays. His first play was "My Heart's in the Highlands," in which he expressed the success of democracy. Later, he wrote many plays, and "The Human Comedy" has already been made into a movie.</p>
<p>His play "The Time of Your Life?" written in 1939, aroused much praise and won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature, but he openly refused to accept the prize, his reason being that "Businessmen have no right to subsidize literature."</p>
<p>Saroyan never formally attended school, but he eventually achieved great literary success through his talent and his efforts. When the war broke out, he did not hesitate to join the military and work. Years of combat life overseas have given him more writing material. Let's wait and read his new works. Written on July 25th in Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Concerning the Musicality of Poetry <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Tianmu</p>
<p>—Tone and Sentiment—</p>
<p>Regarding the influence of musical sentiment, American professors Farnsworth and Bemont conducted an experiment. They had a group of art students listen to two different melodies without announcing the titles. Afterwards, they asked the students to draw the imagery they received on paper. As a result, no two students drew the same or similar scenes. However, within these diverse scenes, they found a unifying element: sentiment. When the music was melancholic and mournful, the paintings were somber; when the music was light and joyful, the paintings were bright. This applies to music, but in fact, every artistic work radiates a certain sentiment, only expressed in different ways. How does poetry, the essence of all literary forms, express and cultivate its sentiment? Can it, like music, appeal to the sense of hearing through tone and thus infect the listener?</p>
<p>This is the question of the musicality of poetry.</p>
<p>Originally, poetry and song were intertwined. They were expressions of emotion revealed in moments of high excitement or extreme sorrow. This was song, and it could also be called poetry. The two were inseparable, with no clear distinction. Their separation came later. Therefore, poetry undoubtedly originated from music (referring to the unified form of poetry and song). Expressionist aestheticians believed that music and language had the same origin, with the vocal cords being the most primitive instrument. The same vocal cords produce different tones in anger and joy, and the sentiments felt by the listener also differ. The Englishman Spencer said, "Music is a glorified language." He believed that emotion could affect the contraction and expansion of muscles, and changes in muscle contraction and expansion would affect the strength, fineness, pitch, and depth of the tone. According to him, instrumental music evolved from vocal music. Therefore, we can confidently say that the tool of poetry is the tone of language—musical sounds with meaning—poetry is a form of music, or at least it has a strong musicality. It gives listeners a fixed sentiment in the same way as instrumental music. And it immerses them in its specially crafted atmosphere.</p>
<p>How can the tone of poetry convey emotion like musical sounds? In the past, scholars could only explain this through psychological changes (not behavioral psychology). Modern positivist aestheticians can now use various instruments to measure the impact of tone on blood circulation and heart rate. The research report of Foster and Gembel states: "Breathing while listening to music flows the same way as breathing during normal work, but breathing is regular during normal work, and breathing is irregular while listening to music." Mentz found that when the tone is completely harmonious, when the intensity of the sound suddenly changes, or when a piece of music is about to end, the speed of blood flow slows down. Ha. M. Hede conducted even more detailed research and obtained evidence that melancholic tones slow down blood flow, while joyful tones speed up blood flow. This is an explanation of how poetry uses various tones to tap the listener's eardrums, which are then transmitted to the central nervous system, causing corresponding changes in physiology and psychology, and thereby producing the same emotions as the poet, arousing the same "impulse." This "internal imitation" in physiology is the driving force that makes people feel majestic when listening to sonorous and rapid tones, and feel depressed when listening to dark and low tones.</p>
<p>In music, the ancient Greeks considered E major to be stable, D major to be passionate, B major to be mournful, G major to be impetuous, and F major to be licentious. Italian scholars also used the minor second interval of harmony to express sorrow, grief, and doubt, and the major third interval to express joy, courage, confidence, and longing. The minor sixth interval expresses desolation and stillness... Music expresses emotions through the alternating strength, pitch, speed, and slowness of these sounds. Although the syllabic scales of poetry cannot be as fixed as musical notes, it is absolutely certain that it uses tone to convey emotion in the same way as music.</p>
<p>However, poets are not as fortunate as musicians. The sounds used by musicians fill every corner of the universe. These sounds have been accurately calculated by physicists, and the rules of syllables have been organized into a perfect tool. Musicians only need to use this ready-made tool to create, without having to worry about the art itself. But the poet's tool is merely the chaotic and unregulated, messy and clumsy everyday spoken language. It is mixed, rough, and clumsy. It is no wonder that Paul Valéry lamented: "Poets are pitiful. Poets must search from trivial and disordered nouns, and from various rules and illogical laws inherited from the past. These rules and laws are merely created, interpreted, and annotated arbitrarily by someone or many people occasionally as they please."</p>
<p>For the content and form of poetry, scholars have had many heated debates, but in any case, to say that poetry can stand without tone (including rhythm, rhyme, etc.) is as absurd as saying that a beautiful piece of music can be composed from a sound without pitch, strength, length, or duration. Mr. Zhu Guangqian strongly criticized Dr. Hu Shi's theory, created during the May Fourth Movement, that poetry does not need rhyme. In fact, poetry is neither a purely formal game championed by Spencer, nor something that can excessively emphasize content at the expense of form, as advocated by Dr. Hu Shi. In his article "The Principle of Poetry," Hagiwara Sakutaro argued that "The characteristic of poetry is not necessarily the presence or absence of formal rules, nor the presence or absence of free verse. Its expression is related to whether its essence is 'emotional image'—if the meaning expressing emotion is indeed 'emotional image,' then language must use 'emotional language' equipped with all the emotional elements such as rhythm, tone, and voice." This also explains that content determines form, rather than fundamentally despising form. Content creates form, and form completes content. Without technical cultivation to create a beautiful form to match, even with a heart full of passion, it cannot be expressed. We do not need to talk about theory in a vacuum. Let's look at our current poetry scene. The output of poetry is the highest. Editors' drawers are filled with poetry. There are good poems, but most are just disgusting monsters, neither donkey nor horse. This is the reality produced by the atmosphere of not paying attention to (perhaps paying attention to) form or even abandoning form. As Kata Kagei said, "The form and content of poetry are like the water of a river and its banks." At present, our country's poetic language is like the Yellow River changing its course from the old canal to the new canal. Under the impact of the surging river (isn't the stimulus and emotional heat brought to us by the movement of the great era surging enough?), the collapsing new canal cannot match the power of the water flow, so it overflows the embankment and floods everywhere, making it unbearable to clean up. The so-called poetry is all prose written in separate lines. It is a refuge for all novels, Yue operas, reportage, biographies, etc. This prosaicization of poetry is a bankruptcy phenomenon in the poetry world. How to adjust it? I remember that at a literary and art evening, Mr. Li Jianwu shouted loudly for a revolution in form. In poetry, it is necessary to revolutionize the prosaicization of poetry. Poetry is poetry, and prose is prose. They should not be mixed together. The difference between the two lies in tone, and tone is the family treasure of poetry. It is the lifeline of poetry. Who says that rules (of course, not referring to fixing things like level tones and oblique tones as shackles, and calling new rules new shackles?)</p>
<p>After the May Fourth Movement, most metrical poets admired the poetry of French masters. They put a lot of effort into the selection of language tones. However, later, in the hands of the decadent poets who pursued sensory enjoyment, rhyme went into a dead end. It cannot be said that the reaction of the prosaicization of poetry today has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, the pursuit of poetic language is showing a thriving atmosphere again. This is indeed a gratifying scene. Isn't the recitation of poetry and song prevailing? And various dialects are also being tested and refined. For example, using the Wu dialect of Shanghai to translate French poems, and some people using the Ningbo dialect to recite translated poems by Rilke. Other dialects from Sichuan, Yangzhou, Shanghai, etc. are also being tested and explored. This bold attempt is right. Ai Qing once said, "Poets must take risks to create language, just like pearl divers struggling in the entanglement of seaweed in order to pick pearls, diving deep to the bottom of the sea." Not a single true poet is not constantly looking for appropriate language and putting emotion on it, firing outward. To make "it silence us with a charming monotony, and at the same time keep us awake with various changes, it places us in that truly ecstatic state, in which the soul is freed from the pressure of the will and is revealed in symbols" (W. B. Yeats). To make the listener intoxicated in the sentiment of the poem, this is when the tone of the poem is best intertwined with the inner meaning, it is the exquisiteness of poetry, it is the peak of poetic art, and it is also what poets dream of pursuing all their lives.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Sketch of Self-Cultivating Farmer Huang Changgui in Prison <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Falcon</p>
<p>That self-cultivating farmer Huang Changgui has been living here for more than two years. His crime is "murder," but in reality, he has never killed anyone, but was implicated by others, and was wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>He is only twenty-nine years old this year, with a short and sturdy figure, a shaved head, and a fleshy face with two thick black inverted eight-character eyebrows. His slightly swollen eye sockets contain a pair of dull eyes, a round nose, thick lips, and a sluggish expression on his face. He wears a set of broken cotton clothes borrowed from the prison authorities.</p>
<p>If you ask him if he really killed someone, he will say affirmatively in an angry tone: "I didn't kill anyone! If I had killed him, it would have been worth it. That guy was a head of the baojia system, very bad, and no one didn't hate him."</p>
<p>Sitting in prison for a long time is a terrible thing. All of his family property was spent on this lawsuit. Originally, he had a wife who was only twenty years old, and had been married for four or five years, but had not had any children. Last year, after his case was sentenced, his wife remarried. He got four thousand yuan, and also ate it all up in this prison. Now he has no support from outside, only a married poor older sister who occasionally comes to visit him once or twice when she comes to the city. Asked why he let his wife remarry, he said: "She wanted to marry someone, what could I do? I don't know when I will be able to get out, do you want her to live a widow?" After a pause, he went on to describe his wife's appearance: "A pockmarked face, squinty eyes, a limp... looks three parts unlike a human, four parts unlike a ghost!" Obviously, he deliberately described her so ugly to make fun of himself. In fact, this was of course a big blow to him. He sighed and said: "The family she is married to now is not bad..."</p>
<p>In this prison, he seems optimistic on the surface, and you can often hear his laughter—he has such a laughing temperament, that anything can cause him to burst into laughter, and laugh so loudly, so violently, as if he is using all his strength to laugh intently. One day, he didn't know what he thought of, and told people: "If I dressed up as a woman and was locked in the women's cell, it would be a good show!" As he said this, he laughed violently again, laughing so hard that his waist bent over. Therefore, the inmates here often look for opportunities to tease him to laugh. At first, he was just laughing alone, but after a while, everyone was infected and formed a burst of laughter, and his high-pitched laughter surpassed all the surrounding laughter, like a highest note in a choir, leading this chorus. Often we were intoxicated in this laughter, temporarily forgetting the sorrow in the prison.</p>
<p>Often, he makes straw sandals or pastes paper cigarette boxes in this prison. Because of this work, he can receive an extra four taels of coarse rice for each meal, and a hundred or so yuan of bonus money each month, as pocket money for adding dishes here. On days when there is no work to do, he takes on cleaning and other small errands for the wealthy inmates here, and they give him leftovers as compensation. Because his appetite is very large, the two daily prison rations are not enough for him to eat.</p>
<p>His expenses here are very frugal, and he doesn't even smoke cheap tobacco. But he bought twenty yuan of rough-edged paper, bound a notebook, and asked the inmates to copy things like the "Thousand Character Classic" for him to read. In this prison, the atmosphere of reading is very strong. Because they have been sued, they have to come into contact with the black characters on white paper, such as "indictments," "judgments," "rulings," and "defense statements," "appeals," etc. These are a series of troublesome things that are closely related to everyone and can determine their fate. Therefore, after entering the prison, people tasted the disadvantage of being illiterate. At the same time, because of the busyness of life outside, many people did not have the opportunity to study. Reading and literacy has become the best way to pass the time, and it is also very convenient to ask people for advice. Entering this prison, you can see that this is like a cram school. People are reading and writing in groups of two or three. Everyone recognizes a few words more or less after going to jail.</p>
<p>When he has nothing to do, he holds that handwritten notebook, forcibly memorizing one word at a time. When he can't remember, he hits his head and curses: "Damn it, can't remember it!" Or he takes a few sheets of rough paper and copies the words crookedly, stopping from time to time to suck on the tip of the pen, getting his mouth full of ink, smiling foolishly, like a naughty schoolboy in a private school.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he lies on the bed all day without saying a word, just sighing and saying: "Prison is hard to sit!" At this time, if you ask him why he doesn't read, he replies lazily: "No energy!"</p>
<p>Because his case was before 1943, after one commutation, he was resentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Now, the amnesty order has been promulgated again, and I pray that he can regain his freedom soon. July 1946 in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>When sick in bed, I prefer wind and rain to the sun. Seeing the misty and desolate scene of wind and rain outside through the hazy glass window, I have a kind of satisfaction. This satisfaction is almost selfish—I feel lonely myself, and I hope the world will not be too lively either. In order to avoid jealousy of the prosperity of the world, in order to avoid the troubles of many uninvited guests, the continuous wind and rain appear particularly intimate. All the unsatisfactory and annoying things are hidden in this desolate world. At this time, lying quietly in bed and closing the door, there is a feeling of peace in my heart.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I went from Hong Kong to Shanghai and spent three days on the boat. During the three days, I sometimes ran to the deck to see the sea, and sometimes lay in the cabin chatting. The air cylinder on the wall was like a funnel, blowing the vast sea breeze outside into the small hole, which was very cold. A boat drifted on the sea, and the whole world, the pain and troubles, joys and sorrows of the world, were all separated by the ocean. Lying silently in the cabin, there was a carefree satisfaction, as if it was a vacation from life.</p>
<p>Some people don't like this kind of vacation. Every moment of their lives is pre-arranged. They need to step into the bustling world at all times. On rainy days, they can't wear the most beautiful clothes, can't wear the cleanest shoes, open the door and see the rain and wind raging, and have to put on a raincoat, put on that awkward hat, and walk carefully, hailing a car on the street... They hate all these annoying and trivial things. There are also some people who can stay at home, but insist on finding some excuses to go out and play, but it is raining, and they run to the window from time to time to look out, hoping that the wind and rain will stop soon. For these people, the savor of shutting the door in wind and rain will never be appreciated.</p>
<p>Modern people's lives seem too cramped, so cramped that there is no room for leisure. Stealing leisure from busyness, getting sick seems to be the best and only excuse. But lying in bed, if the weather is good, you can't help but see the dazzling sunlight, and you can't help but hear the bustling city sounds. So there is a feeling of desolation being neglected, and annoyance of being abandoned by happiness. At this time, how much I hope the weather will change suddenly—the room is full of cool wind, and the sky is full of wind and rain. Even though I am in the ward, it is as if it is the small boat of Adam fleeing in the past!</p>
<p>I often think that when a person of advanced age no longer hopes to compete in this world, and already regards pain and happiness as the same, it would be such a wise thing to title his study "Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain"! He is separated from this world, but he has not left it. He can watch this world in stillness, watching the pain and troubles, sorrows and joys of this world; watching the disturbances of this world. When it really rains, he can't help but be busy, hurrying to close the windows, but forgetting the door. The big characters on the door, "Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain Studio," may have been blown away by the wind and rain.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Madonna and Child <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Painted by Botticelli (1444-1510)</p>
<p>Displayed at the National Gallery in London</p>
<p>Botticelli was once famous during his lifetime, but was soon forgotten by the world. It was not until the Victorian era (19th century), the so-called "New Renaissance," that great talents emerged in art and literature, and Botticelli's greatness was rediscovered. This picture "Madonna and Child" is one of Botticelli's masterpieces. The Madonna sits quietly in front of the window, making people immediately recall her young age. It is said that the Madonna was only fourteen years old when she gave birth to Jesus, so the Madonna in the picture should also be no more than fifteen. Botticelli made us beautifully recall her youth, and gave her a kind of sad sweetness in her appearance, which moved all later generations who saw it. Her hair and headdress are all bright golden, according to this is one of the characteristics of Botticelli's works, because Botticelli was a goldsmith in his early years.</p>

<p>— Xuehua</p>
<p>Last year today, I was like a little trapped beast, hiding in a cold and desolate little room. A friend came to see me. I stretched out a yellow, weary arm and embraced her, excitedly saying:</p>
<p>"Friend, I'm neglecting you today, but if I'm still alive next year on this day, I will decorate my doors and windows with amorous golden gauze, make beautiful tablecloths with tender yellow soft silk, insert red fresh flowers into green vases, and spray fragrant lily dew into every corner. Ah, friend! At that time, I will invite you here to drink a glass of wine with me, to celebrate the passing of the dark night, the arrival of the light, and the radiant flames of freedom and happiness shining upon the world! Oh, friend, do you think that day will ever come?"</p>
<p>My friend smiled slightly and replied, "Of course!"</p>
<p>Life is a cloud of undirected mist, and what propels the cloud of mist is an elusive fantasy!</p>
<p>I dare not say I fully believe this sentence, but I have indeed spent my lonely childhood and solitary youth in fantasy; and I have indeed spent many desolate years in fantasy.</p>
<p>Last year today, how could I not worry that my hope would be like a beautiful soap bubble, about to burst in an instant? And how could I not worry that my friend's smile would be like a wisp of sunset in the west, about to disappear in the blink of an eye? Yet I still clung to the hope of a "what if": ——</p>
<p>What if my fantasy became reality! What if my friend's "of course" could be realized! …</p>
<p>"I cannot be pessimistic, I must expect!" I encouraged myself in this way, comforted myself. And so, a year quickly passed.</p>
<p>Today this year, I am still alive, and my friend has come to my cold and desolate little room again.</p>
<p>Where is the golden gauze? Where is the tender yellow soft silk? Where are the red flowers, fragrant dew, and fine wine? And where are the light, freedom, and happiness? … Did I deceive her, or did she deceive me? We are all at a loss.</p>
<p>"Don't be disappointed, look forward to today next year!" Holding my icy hand, my friend still tried to struggle.</p>
<p>"Yes, look forward to today next year!" I also still wanted to struggle.</p>
<p>But in the end, we both burst into tears! —— Oh, the pitiful lies! Today this year, what courage do we still have to imagine today next year?</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A friend of mine used to work at the Kai Zao Coal Mine. He told me many scenes of the mine, one of which was a strange experiment of his. He said, "The mine shafts go deep underground, which is another world. The various insects that we don't usually see or have never seen are 'commonplace' and not surprising to the miners. Because of this environment, I suddenly thought of doing an experiment one Dragon Boat Festival to test which of these many insects was the fiercest and most poisonous.</p>
<p>I found a large washbasin and a large piece of glass to cover it. After a lot of effort, I caught geckos, scorpions, centipedes, snakes, bees, water insects, spiders, and many other unknown small animals, and put them all in this washbasin.</p>
<p>It was truly a spectacle, the most intense and thrilling scuffle, biting, chasing, jumping, twisting, and struggling, each using all its strength. In the intermittent battle of a few hours, I watched with bated breath, but what particularly interested me was the spider, about the size of a thumb. From beginning to end, the tactic it adopted was to dodge and avoid direct conflict with any insect. However, while fleeing, it desperately spun silk, weaving its web continuously. People may not believe it, but the weapon created by its tiny body spread across most of the washbasin, and the result was predictable. The others were either on the verge of death or exhausted, one by one being bound in its web, while it, this thumb-sized spider, sat leisurely in a remote corner of the web, looking a bit tired, but also pleased with the abundance of its harvest!</p>
<p>The next few days were days for it to slowly enjoy itself, eating them alive and dead, until they were all consumed."</p>
<p>What does this story bring us?</p>
<p>Is it the power of that extremely fine and delicate spider silk?</p>
<p>Are there any other inspirations? We can all slowly chew on it!</p>

<p>— Bailian</p>
<p>The Chang Dong'e case was publicly tried a few days ago (22nd). Yu and Huang, the two section chiefs, seemed steady as Mount Tai as they attended the trial. Chang Dong'e's mother cried loudly in court, scolding Yu and Huang as "two killers." She also said that when the property was sealed, there were only three and a half rooms in her house, but as many as twenty-eight sealing strips were affixed. Another interesting thing happened in court: when the lawyer hired by Yu and Huang tried to speak, he was stopped by the prosecutor, and the audience burst into loud hisses. There were more than two hundred people attending the trial, and the people of Suzhou were all watching closely. However, the "Xin Su Daily Evening Post," published on the same day, carried the results of the trial, stating that the prosecutor needed Chang Dong'e's mother to collect evidence of Yu and Huang's corruption and bribery before the trial could be resumed. Public opinion in all circles seems to be very dissatisfied with this move. The Suzhou Chang Dong'e case support group has proposed other suggestions, perhaps because the prosecutor's request for Chang'e's mother to collect evidence of Yu and Huang's bribery is excessively forced and seems to favor them!</p>
<p>An epidemic is prevalent in Suzhou, and welcoming god ceremonies appear one after another. These ceremonies show a grand display of instruments, but the waste is particularly serious. Embroidered banners and barefoot performers are all covered in bright costumes, shouting loudly. There are also "living lamps" in the ceremonies, where steel needles are densely pierced into the arms, tied with red ropes, and then small scenery or steel rings are tightly fastened below. Some even bind entire candlesticks weighing two or three hundred catties on top, causing the arm flesh to droop down, the state being extremely cruel. And they are mostly children around the age of twelve, the mystery of which is truly beyond the ability of outsiders to glimpse. It is said that each ceremony costs more than thirty or forty million yuan, which makes everyone click their tongues. Yesterday, the party headquarters and the two county governments stopped it, but today it is said that another group has appeared, ordering them to submit a document. The ignorant people are truly impossible to teach.</p>
<p>Suzhou's drama scene only has one Golden Star Theater; Chen Baicheng's play "An Official's Image" is currently being performed, and the box office is extremely prosperous. Golden Star 2 is as small as a pigeon cage, and it is very hot, but every show is full, and the performance is excellent. Did the previous two plays at "Golden Star" lose tens of millions? Since the performance of "An Official's Image," the losses have been recovered and there is a slight surplus. "An Official's Image" has been performed for about a month and a half, directed by Wu Chen, i.e. Wei Yu. The performances are all copied from the old Shanghai style, only the "theft" character hanging in the center of the lamp is changed to "honesty." The five-yuan and ten-yuan small denomination banknotes issued by the Four Banks are rejected by shops in the market, and many banks also refuse to accept them for deposit, using the difficulty of counting as an excuse. People also do not carry them when shopping, and they have become "waste" in an invisible way. The county chamber of commerce once announced that all shops should accept them, but the result is still waste paper. Currently, only the post office can use them to buy stamps, but even that is limited to a small amount, and larger amounts are rejected. Hong Junyun, the manager of the Suzhou branch of the Siming Bank, will launch a "Small Money Relief Campaign" to use these small denomination banknotes to relieve the victims of the disaster in northern Jiangsu, which is being submitted to the authorities for instructions. This move should also be a win-win situation!</p>
<h3 id="e153">Increased Troops in Macau <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Macau is under Portuguese rule, and historically it is only a vague basis, but this has been going on for many years, even longer than the Hong Kong of the Treaty of Nanjing. But this small place seems to not attract much attention in political diplomacy, but although the place is not very important, it is still a most adverse influence on the Guangdong people, especially the people of Zhongshan County. This is of course in its colonial policy, which is greatly contrary to our domestic politics. Therefore, for many years, perhaps since it has had its own territory, it has been nothing more than a refuge for Chinese thugs, except for opium, gambling and prostitution.</p>
<p>However, this place has been ignored by Chinese politics, and the people seem to treat it like an insignificant thing, or regard it as a garbage can, and many people do not look at it directly.</p>
<p>Recently, it has suddenly increased its troops, and many weapons have also arrived. This batch of reinforcements is more than a thousand black soldiers, transferred from Timor Island, which is the Portuguese regular army guarding Timor Island, so the equipment is still complete. It is just unclear what the intention is. The Macau government has not stated the reason for this increase in troops. What we have learned from the news reports is that after this batch of troops arrived, the old soldiers were changed to police. Then, the power of the police has also been strengthened as a result.</p>
<p>What kind of threat has Macau been subjected to that has led to increased defense? Is it because there are Chinese troops stationed in Qianshan? Chinese troops have always been stationed in Qianshan, but they have always been few in number, and they have no intention or intention towards Macau, and the task of the Chinese troops is not here. The Macau government should not be so alarmed. Then, what facts does it have as a basis for increasing troops? Except for the Portuguese government, no one else knows!</p>
<p>Some people think that the United States wants to lease Luwan as an airport, and the Macau government plans to build an iron bridge from the Jia Silan Fortress to connect with Luwan, so they increase troops first to strengthen defense. This is not a reason, and it cannot be used as a basis for facts. Because if the United States wants to lease Luwan, it has to ask the Chinese government. The Portuguese do not have this right to lease, and there is no need for them to increase troops for defense. Others think that it is to protect two tycoons, Gao Kening and Fu Laorong, that they do not hesitate to mobilize troops. This sounds like the Portuguese have a reason. The reason is that those two Chinese traitors are the Macau government's gods of wealth. Gao Kening and others have long been closely protected, not only are their exits and entrances followed by armed Portuguese police, but their residences are also specially equipped with six lines of defense. But this is superfluous, perhaps it is just the Macau government's own meddling. When the Chinese government issues a document requesting extradition, who is afraid that he will not hand over the two men? Therefore, I think even this is not a factual basis for the Macau government. (According to a report last month, the United States has already given up on the Guan Jian airport matter).</p>
<p>Then why did the Portuguese government increase troops in Macau? Is there another international war in the Far East? Was Macau only threatened by war after the Japanese surrendered? The Macau government cannot but make an explanation. (July 23rd.)</p>

<p>An American soldier and a Red Army soldier were discussing their governments in Berlin. The American soldier said to the Red Army soldier, "You can go to the White House in Washington to see President Truman, wait for him to get up, and then raise your finger in front of the president and criticize Truman's good and bad points."</p>
<p>The Red Army soldier said, "You can go to the Kremlin to see Marshal Stalin, wait for him to get up, and then point your finger in Marshal Stalin's face."</p>
<h3 id="e155">Tomorrow Never Comes <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>I borrowed a book from a friend, and she readily agreed. Because of my urgent need, I urged her every day. After urging her for two weeks, I still didn't get the book. Her answer to me was always "tomorrow."</p>
<p>After getting this result, I never mentioned it to her again. If I asked her again, it would be really embarrassing. It's as if I'm not borrowing a book, but demanding a debt from her. Fortunately, I'm not a debt collector, otherwise, I would go to collect the debt on New Year's Eve, so that she would have no way to answer "tomorrow."</p>
<p>Now, I have deeply realized that the common people's faults are not being punctual, procrastination, and laziness. As long as there is a minute or a second, they try to delay it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, God has created a natural "tomorrow" in the universe for people to use, otherwise, those who often break their promises will have no room for retreat.</p>
<p>I remember in a certain organization in Chengdu, ten minutes before get off work, the director of the office received an official document. Because he was eager to go home to eat dinner and accompany his wife to see a movie, he thought to himself, "Anyway, there are only ten minutes left before get off work, why not deal with it tomorrow?" So, he hurriedly took the file home. The next day, he forgot to bring the file to the office and left it at home, so the third day, the fourth day... it was still left at home for two months.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, not long after, the superior ordered an investigation into this file. After searching back and forth, they couldn't find it. He was so anxious that he had to issue an emergency order to the secretary and all the section chiefs: "Investigate immediately." After investigating back and forth, they still couldn't find it. He was furious and reprimanded the secretary in official jargon. The secretary reprimanded the section chief in official jargon, and the section chief reprimanded the staff in official jargon, but there was still no result. After a few days, it was suddenly discovered in his son's hands. It turned out that his son was very naughty and had no paper for making kites, so he took this file to paste the kite as he pleased. It was really whimsical. After he saw it, he was speechless with anger and could only confess his guilt to the superior. The superior believed that this matter was no small matter, "negligence of duty delaying military affairs" and immediately dismissed him.</p>
<p>There was another time, also in Chengdu, in a military education institution, one evening on a day off, a student suffered from acute appendicitis. He was carried to the hospital to see a doctor. Coincidentally, a duty soldier called the president of the institution, and the reply was: "Today is a holiday, and it's late, so send him to the ward first, and I'll take care of it for him tomorrow." The duty soldier followed the order and sent the patient to the ward, but when the president came the next morning, the student had already died.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and tomorrow, tomorrow never comes, but striving for timeliness and cherishing every inch of time is the key to all success!</p>
<h3 id="e156">"Too Wordy" Confucius Scolds Zhu Xi <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>A Ku Ling dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th, Mr. Jiang Menglin once told reporters a joke: Zhu Xi saw Confucius and wrote on his business card "Disciple Zhu Xi bows a hundred times," adding a note: "Zhu is the surname, Xi is the name, disciple is a student, a hundred bows are a hundred times of kowtowing." Confucius looked at it and exclaimed "Wordy!"</p>
<p>There is more to this joke, supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>After Zhu Xi heard Confucius exclaim wordy, he added a note: "Wordy means troublesome." Confucius impatiently said: "Too wordy!" Zhu Xi then added a note: "Too means a further level, wordy see the previous note."</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Story of Wireless Facsimile <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>

<p>The invention of phototelegraphy dates back to 1924 AD. At that time, the telegraph bureau in Cleveland, USA, used wires to transmit several landscape photos of Lake Erie to New York. Forty-four minutes later, the first phototelegraph in history appeared in the New York Times. Therefore, phototelegraphy has been developed for a full twenty-two years.</p>
<p>Since then, after ten years of experiments and research, it has been formed on a certain scale; but the same: London sent a photo of King George V, and it felt very blurry after receiving it. After careful observation, they felt very strange; what was the gray mark like a medal on the upper part of the King's left waist? What was even stranger was that his chin was like a child's. It turned out that his famous and beloved beard had disappeared. Finally, the matter was cleared up. Because during the transmission process, a part of the machine turned suddenly, so it accidentally moved the sideburns to the waist. This small setback prompted scientists to work hard to improve and finally achieve the greatest success.</p>
<p>In this war, wireless phototelegraphy exerted its highest efficiency and achieved unparalleled merit. Most cities such as Stockholm, Moscow, Lisbon, Cairo, Istanbul, Kunming, Chongqing, Paris, Brussels, and small cities in Africa also have this receiving equipment to transmit real news messages by means of phototelegraphy.</p>
<p>Speaking of China having this equipment, there is also a very interesting thing: in 1942, a meaningful historical document was transmitted from China to Los Angeles. This was a Chinese letter from President Chiang to President Roosevelt congratulating the successful radio photographic communication between China and the United States; at that time, the US naval authorities and journalists were at a loss, and no one could translate it. Finally, at 2 am, they searched all over Chinatown in Los Angeles and found a Chinese person, who happily recited it. What was exciting was not only this, but also the amazing development of the motherland's communication work.</p>
<p>Since the invention of phototelegraphy, it has been widely used:</p>
<p>A heart patient living in New Jersey City on the Atlantic coast transmitted two charts of heart rate to a heart specialist in Chicago. One hour later, the patient had received a return telegram of the doctor's diagnosis.</p>
<p>General James of the United States transmitted a photograph of a one thousand dollar check from London. The trust department of the New York bank received it within a few minutes and immediately cashed it. The New York Police Department caught a suspect. When his fingerprints were transmitted to the Chicago Police Department, they looked up the files for comparison. Within a few minutes, the evidence of the crime was established, making it impossible for the criminal to quibble.</p>
<p>The various cruel and brutal atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps during the war were almost unbelievable until radio photography faithfully recorded and disseminated the situation, and everyone was convinced.</p>
<p>When everyone was doubting Mussolini's death, phototelegraphy had already transmitted the ugly state of the Devil lying in Milan, overthrowing all rumors and lies.</p>
<p>This is the "electric eye" of the people of the twentieth century!</p>
<h3 id="e158">Celibacy and Chastity <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ling</p>
<p>The meanings of celibacy and chastity can be said to be completely different. The former is a perpetual, organized suppression of love; while the latter is a perpetual, organized suppression of sexual desire.</p>
<p>Therefore, so-called chastity is not the negation of love, but the preparation for love. This is indeed an act and ideal of exploring love and hoping to obtain the qualification for love, and it is a problem that young men and women cannot but study and explore deeply. Because chastity is one of the noblest morals of youth. The importance of chastity has been discussed repeatedly by those who care about the issue of love today, but still without results.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is because their explanations are confused with celibacy. Celibacy is a distortion of life, one of the intellectual and moral diseases of life. The origin of the ideal of celibacy is extremely easy to explain. When mankind was at a certain stage of development, opened its mind, and a life of altruism and sympathetic imagination was reflected in the minds of some people. In ordinary language, it is that mankind discovered its own spiritual nature. But what is the usual state? Everything outside suppresses that nature, attempting to bury it in the soil. Among those destructive forces, the strongest is sex. When the power of sex is activated, it will completely fail to understand the higher ideals of mankind, and only feed on mankind for its own convenience. When it shows its power, it will take away money, health, time, reputation, and everything else from mankind. The world's wise men, old Flaubert, and Bacon, once said such a sentence: "To marry and have children is to shackle one's own limbs." Bacon fled to the Sahara in order to discover that this evil spirit lived in his own spirit. He hid in a cave, starved and refused food, and allowed insects and wind to invade at will. He only wanted to eradicate the sexual impulse burning in his body.</p>
<p>The construction of monasteries and convents, and religious cultivation, have the same starting point. This idea of ​​seeing sexual relations as evil and depraved, even permeates the minds of modern people, in all aspects such as literature, social inheritance, and law, hindering the true understanding of love, and preventing the path to health and happiness through love.</p>
<p>The ideal of celibacy is an intellectual and moral disease, a desecration of nature. Nature has poured all its power into breaking it, and finally succeeded.</p>
<p>Celibacy also has another form, which is not due to religious concepts, but originates from economic reasons. It carries a purely selfish nature, without organizational or theoretical basis. In the form of shouting "single life", a system of old and young prostitution has been generated. Regardless of whether the reason is family education or economic, in short, any form of celibacy cannot be consistent with chastity that recognizes love and respects love. Chastity is the preparation for love, but if love is prohibited due to laws, social inheritance, or economic oppression, then so-called chastity or virginity will be transformed into the fantasy of idealists.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Meal Expenses and Academic Credits <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— From the Party Department</p>
<p>Let me report on two matters:</p>
<p>Our school, because it is located in the eastern suburbs of Shanghai, almost all students are boarders. Meal expenses are paid monthly. The third installment of meal expenses before the end of the last semester, because the final exams were approaching, and students were studying on campus, they were unable to go home to get money. Therefore, the school authorities issued a notice in the hall:</p>
<p>"It has been resolved by the school affairs committee that those who do not pay the third installment of meal expenses will not have any of their academic credits earned this semester counted. Do not complain. This is a strict notice."</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the end of the semester, a seat reservation fee must be paid according to regulations, but the school authorities stipulated that those who are overdue will have to pay double the seat reservation fee.</p>
<p>Regarding the punishment received for the above two matters, I find it quite interesting to contemplate!</p>
