<p>本年四月間，馬歇爾將軍曾經回國向杜魯門總統述職。聽說在第一天早晨，他和杜魯門會晤之後，下午杜總統就召見了司徒雷登博士，談些什麼，沒人知道，可是一項，「馬路新聞」就開始傳播了，而且傳遍美國，傳到中國，說是馬歇爾將軍在華累月工作，所得的收獲，不足以慰酬他底勞苦，他厭倦了·厭倦了，司徒博士會來替代他。沒有多少天，馬歇爾將軍又回到中國，從重慶到南京，仍然始終不懈的爲這個多難的友邦　忙；而司徒博士也靜靜地回到了北平，專心去照料燕大的復校工作；但這並不能使人們，——尤其是感覺特別銳敏的記者們，完全相信司徒博士和中國政府與中共的談商無關，因為他在南京時，常出入於寗海路五號的馬帥行館中。</p>
<p>今天（十五日）中午，司徒大使又從北平飛到南京了，這無疑是南京的記者們最注意的人和事，於是大家開始捉迷藏，儘力去訪謁這位中國老友的新大使。記者於下午七點二十分到了上海路美國大使館，但因新大使公出未晤，直到九點半鐘，記者再到上海路，大使還沒回來，只好找到寗海路，果然新大使在和馬帥看電影，於是記者決定等下去，這機會是不能放過的。同時，從大使坐車的司機口中，知通大使於六點三二十分離開使館後，先到頣和路六號去看過害着傷風的傳顧問，停了一刻鐘的樣子，然後就到寗海路來和馬帥一起吃晚飯。之後，又一起看電影</p>
<p>「如今電影剛剛完！」是十點零五分鐘。</p>
<p>坐在「吉普」上等，等，等，十點二十五分鐘，馬帥底小汽車開了出來，上面坐的正是司徒大使，記者就緊緊追上去，一直到上海路大使館宿舍。記者跳下「吉普」，趕幾步，一張名片，一聲「閣下」，將道位慈祥可親的老學者迎在他底車門邊。他笑了，說：「幾分鐘，可以的！」</p>
<p>這是一間小小起坐間，一副辦公桌椅，一對沙發，一對軟椅，此外，就是一些簡單的文具。一盞吊燈縣在室中央，柔和的燈光，使人忘記兩個鐘頭以前的悶熱。記者和大使對坐在矮矮的軟椅上，我聽着老學者底輕輕的語句。</p>
<p>「我今天沒到什麼地方去，我也沒看到什麼人，這幾天的日程還沒有定。我目前作的是安排私事，並作呈遞國書的準備，同時對當前的情勢研究一下。在沒有呈遞國書前，任河工作都還談不到。」</p>
<p>「大使預備甚麼時候覲見蔣主席？在那里呈遞國書呢」</p>
<p>「這都要看蔣主席如何決定，呈遞國盡的地方——」</p>
<p>「廬山」？</p>
<p>「也許是。」</p>
<p>「聽外交部李司長說，已經進備在廬山舉行基遞國書的典禮。」</p>
<p>「很可能」大使笑笑。隨後他說，「明天我將和外交部接洽一下我今後幾天的日程。」</p>
<p>「大使準備什麼時候和周恩來先生晤面？」</p>
<p>「我還沒考慮過這問題，在我未看到蔣主席呈遞國書以前，我不預備正式會見任何人。」</p>
<p>「大使是不是要舉行一次記者招待會？」</p>
<p>「一時還沒　個準備，不過我會保留你底卡片，隨時和你接觸，我一定儘可能的供給你們消息。」</p>
<p>「大使今天看的電影好不好？哪一張片子？」</p>
<p>「啊，不好，馬歇爾將軍因爲我累了，所以請我看電影，叫：“InTangier”T．A．N……美國北部的一個地方。」</p>
<p>「隨後，他問我一些讀書方面的事情，他還提到燕大的新聞系。在柔和的燈光下，我看到他似乎是疲乏了，我感謝他給我這個晤談的機會，更感謝他不辭辛勞地爲中國人民底幸福而努力。他回答我：「我愛中國，我這次担任這個職務，是以學者的身份來帮助馬歇爾將軍，爲中國的和平而努力，我希望我的工作不致失敗。」</p>
<p>至此，我就站了起來，互道晚安，記者並再三致謝他的奸意，於是辭了出來。</p>
<p>這時是十時四十一分，月華如水，記者腦海中留下一個深刻的印象——誠懇，和蔼，熱情，持重的老人。希望他能和馬帥齊力帮助我們，希望我們，帮助自己，把目前沉重陰霾的局面打破。</p>
<p>——七月十五日深夜</p>

<h3>聯總遠東區大會　昨在滬隆重舉行　運華物資決延至明年六月底止　周恩來今來滬續商黃河堵口事</h3>
<p>［聯合社本市訊］聯總遠東區代表大會今日決議：（一）向日內瓦聯總全體代表大會建議，聯總對華救濟品之運輸截止期，從一九四七年三月三十一日展延至一九四七年六月三十日。（二）建議聯總與中國政府談判，俾維持聯總對華分署至一九四七年十二月三十一日爲止。大會通過決議案時，對於聯總署長賴伽第亞不久或將撤銷對華停運物資令之希望，漸趨濃厚。大會今日又表决通過小組委員會之報告書，僅中國代表蔣延黻投反對票。報告書將提出聯總全體大會，內稱：雖經種種努力，中共佔據區內平均分配聯總救濟品之工作，尚未完成，近月來行總之分配工作已因經費不足而受嚴重之阻碍。</p>
<p>（本報訊）「聯總」遠東區大會，昨晨於中國銀行四樓隆重舉行。到會者有我國蔣延黻，向景雲，澳洲考佰闌，法國貝爾丁，印度哈森，新西蘭蕭氏，荷蘭斯帶克，英國邢德女士，蘇聯西米那斯，美國吉爾配屈立克。由蔣延黻任主席，新自北平返滬之聯總駐華分署代理署長賴氏任秘書。</p>
<p>（上午之會）</p>
<p>蔣氏於說明該會議程後，即開始討論。美代表吉爾配屈立克當稱「行總」航運大隊，現已交由招商局辦理，將該隊置於一政府機構之下，彼以爲不甚妥當。蔣氏答稱：彼意「聯總」法規之中，航運大隊實係直屬「行總」管轄。旋由「聯總」遣送局局長薩柏報告，略謂：吳市長曾詢問歐洲難民能否早日遣送回國，以便騰出空屋，供我國復員同胞居住。中國當局，實望於六個月內遣送完畢，而事實上上海一萬五千歐籍難民之中，祗六千人曾表示有歸還其本國之意向，其餘諸人，均欲改往美國·澳洲·加拿大等處，而等候各該國允可入境之護照，或且需時達二三年之久。即以願歸其本國之難民而言，目前管理歐境（尤其是德奧二國）之各國軍事當局，對彼等回國一事，亦尚未獲致協議。薩柏要求大會能對此事處理方針，有所說明。美代表吉爾配屈立克對「聯總」所感困難，深表同情，並謂此輩難民如欲前往美國，恐非易事。吉氏並稱：中國政府對此嚴重問題，似宜加以注意。蔣延黻答稱：「行總」當盡力謀解決之方，但此事最後方針，仍須由中國政府決定。美代表旋就平津韓僑所受待遇，有所申述，並表示希望勿對韓僑加以歧視。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表旋即提出詢問，要求就衛生署如何分配由「聯總」得來之經費一點，詳加說明。蔣氏答稱：此款係由中國政府支配，政府是否能提供有關材料，彼殊不能代言。</p>
<p>美代表又稱：「行總」爲交通部裝配卡車及機車，向不收費，彼以爲中國政府應該付代價。</p>
<p>印代表建議「行總」於實施工賑之時，似可酌量付給現款，俾麵粉等物，可分配於需要更迫切之區域。</p>
<p>上午十一時許，吳市長亦來旁聽，至午始去，大會於十二時半宣布休息。</p>
<p>（下午之會）</p>
<p>下午四時一刻，會議重開。首卽討論「聯總」工作期限，當決定向五屆大會（八月五日在日內瓦召開）建議，請講聯總物資運華，延至明年六月三十日止，同時聯總應向中國商議，使聯總駐華分署亦延至明年年底。關於此點之一切預算及計劃，應於本年年底前向遠東巨大會提出討論，如至明年運輸物資期滿之時，仍有續運需要，則屆時可考慮是否再予延展。</p>
<p>關於「聯總」內部改組問題，自六月下旬起，蔣氏即曾晋諣宋院長商談多次。七月十六日，宋院長復與蔣氏·賴氏，及「聯總」駐華分署若干高級職員舉行會商，除改組辦法外，並對行總聯總嗣後如何可以更爲密切合作，亦會商酌，當時決定之辦法，已逐漸付諸實施，改組最重要之一點，爲執行長權力之加重。財務分配，儲運各廳，及各分署工作，人事，及分配，將盡由執行長負責。惟「聯總」將物資分配與政院各部會或其他單位時，則由署長決定。此外，政院並將派代表駐於分配廳。至於「聯總」之工礦，工業，衛生三委員會，如需變賣物資時，亦須由執行長核准。「聯總」並須派遣高級職員，駐政院辦公，負責與各部會聯絡一切。又「聯總」以後如借調外籍人員，須經署長，副署長，執行長會同決定。</p>
<p>「聯總」透支經費，現已決定本年內不得超過八百億，任何一個月中，不得超過三百億。</p>
<p>「聯總」以後與「聯總」間加强合作辦法，已決定行文程序必須加速，此外，「聯總」於啓運物資時，應負責檢查，並担保此項物資確可應用，否則「聯總」不予接受。凡運輸機械時，並須提供充份用法說明及全部另件。</p>
<p>上海倉庫中目前堆積物資，多係笨重機器，現正力謀處清，並由劉鴻生·華鳳翔·陳廣沅等三人與「聯總」方面人員，合組清理委員會，專辦此事。</p>
<p>「聯總」自本年一月一日起至七月十日止，勞務方面費用，已領得之總額爲法幣四三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，實付一七二·二六〇·一一七·四〇〇元，尚存二五九·七三九·八八二·六〇〇元。支出主要項目爲：修繕全國煤道，黃河工程，外籍專家之雜費薪工及其他費用，難民急救（包括蘇北難民尤以六月二十日及七月九日二次所費尤鉅），海防工程，及其他水利工程如江堤等。</p>
<p>［又訊］周恩來定今（十八日）晨由京來滬，與蔣延黻繼續商談黃河堵口工程問題，時間定爲上午八時至十一時，因此，今日之聯總遠東區大會，將延至十一時半召開。</p>
<h3>我國分配聯總物資　從未含政治作用　已電令顧大使向聯總詳爲說明</h3>
<p>［本報南京十七日電］聯總此次突然停運物資來華，美國務院及馬特使均對我政府先後聲明事前並未知悉。美農部專家哈禮遜在美已表示：就彼所知，中國分配物資從未有政治作用。此間官方及社會人士意見認爲聯總乃聯合國之機構，中國亦爲參加構成之一主權國，聯總在未得各參加國同意前，絕無可以遽自停運物資至任何應受救濟國家之權，聯總中國分署一部份職員，未明事實，受人利用，聯總竟予輕信，殊爲遺憾。政府已電顧大使向美政府及聯總詳爲說明，並盼即日恢復。</p>

<h3>後方工廠復員委會　要求組聯合工廠　推代表六人抵京請願</h3>
<p>［本報南京十七日電］中國生產促進會後方工廠復員委員會所屬五十餘工廠推派六代表來京請願，曾於昨日上下午時分別訪晤經濟部潘次長序倫，王部長雲五等提出組織聯合工廠之意見。今日復赴行政院，由李循和秘書約定明日晋見宋院長或蔣秘書長夢　，同時各代表準備向參政會駐會委員會·立法院·國防最高委員會等，分別呼籲。明日下午三時，並擬假勵志社招待首都新聞界，有所報告。一行將於十九日回滬。</p>
<p>［中央社南京十七日電］中國生產促進會所屬後方工廠復員委員會總幹事謝天河，頃對記者稱：該會係內遷中小型工廠五十餘家來滬代表所組成，陝·甘·川·湖·黔·滇·桂·諸省內遷工廠，四百馀家，亦正陸續接洽加入中，目前留在後方之各廠，大多陷入停工狀態，各廠代表人來滬後，均渴欲本過去工業報國之志，爲復員建國，稍盡綿薄，刻因鑒於上海一地，接收之敵僞工廠，自當局將一部份標售以來，多數乏人承受，以致形成一面工廠停工，一面工人失業之不合理現象。該會各會員工廠，雖有意從事經營，但苦無資金承購，爰經縝密考慮，草成「聯合工廠計劃」，擬請當局撥給尚未售出之多數工廠，交由該會各會員聯合經營。事先須行估定各工廠之總價值，發行股票，或公司債，歸政府所執有，規定在一年後，開始由聯合工廠購回或償還，十年內分期全部付清，俾可容納失業工人，並增加國內生產，而內遷各工業家，亦得繼續發揮其工業報國之悃忱。謝氏最後並稱：本會此一計劃，事前曾得政府有關方面之贊助，此次來京，旨在接洽具體原則，使其實現。</p>
<h3>潘序倫談話</h3>
<p>協助內遷工廠復員　考慮工貸免還本息</p>
<p>［中央社南京十七日電］關於協助後方內遷工廠復員問題，據經濟部潘次長序倫談政府措施情形稱：政府應協助內遷工廠優惠復員，原則上絕無嫌疑餘地。（一）因內遷工廠對抗戰貢獻之程度不同，故應得協助，甚雖獲得不偏不倚之標準。（二）因收復區接收之敵僞工廠，除一部份已撥交資源委員會經營外，所餘各廠之性能及類別，是否完全適合內遷復員各廠商之個別需要，亦非全無問題，近聞一部份內遷工廠有復員委員會之組織，且擬具聯合工廠計劃，就商本部，自所歡迎，惟盼此種團體能擴大普遍，至關於協助內遷工廠復員之方式，自非此上述一端，如去年勝利後政府所予後方各廠之緊急工貸二十七億元，最近亦在考慮如何連本帶息，一律豁免，藉資救濟，並示獎助。</p>

<h3>杜魯門簽署法案　協助我加強海軍　艦船二七一艘讓與我國</h3>
<p>［美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電］杜魯門總統本日簽署法案一件，規定協助中華民國加强及維持海軍之組織。該法案授權總統最多以美艦船二百七十一艘供給中國，另加水上船塢及其他必要之材料。該法案規定爲各該艦隊訓練船員，並經中國之請求時，另派美海軍軍官百名與士兵二百名赴華。關於各該艦隊之付款及條件，總統賦有取舍權。又電參院對海軍援華法案所作之報告書謂：中國目前所需要者僅爲驅逐巡邏級及較小之輕型艦艇。中國重建海防工作之需求則與美國海岸防防禦部隊所需要之艦艇不相上下。中國所需要之其他艦艇爲掃除日本水雷，遣送日人，輸送海外華僑返國及發展沿岸貨運之船艇。美海軍部宣稱，該部願以二百七十一艘艦艇移轉與中國，此批艦艇現在遠東一帶，此批剩餘艦艇包括流動船塢二艘修理船二艘，驅逐巡邏艦二艘，掃雷艇二十四艘，潛艇驅逐艦二十八艘，登陸艇一百九十三艘，油船三艘，調查艇一艘，摩托砲艇六艘，浮筒及輕型渡船六艘。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯的廣播</h3>
<p>美國務卿貝爾納斯自巴黎歸抵美京，於一昨發表全國性之廣播，報告最近外長會議之經過與結果，蘇聯代表在外長會議所取態度之强硬，往往獨持己見，因而對於若干重要問題，迄未成立協議，貝爾納斯對於蘇聯此種政策，曾爲嚴正的指摘。的確，自外長會議於上月召開於巴黎以來，會場空氣頗不和諧，對於歐洲當前之若干問題，英美如有所主張，蘇聯必有反對，蘇聯若有所主張，同樣亦必遭英美之反對。此項場面之演出，誠令人感覺惶恐。軸心之擊潰，原賴英美蘇等國之協同作戰，今軸心既已擊潰，而對於世界和平之重建，列強意見頗有出入：瞻念前途，能不隱憂。</p>
<p>上次巴黎外長會議之召開，費時甚久，雖有和會於七月廿九日召開巴黎之決定，及對於特港問題成立折衷協議，然若于主要問題依萬懸而未決。管制德國之計劃，因蘇聯獨持反對而擱淺；對奧問題亦因蘇聯之獨持異議而無成就；卽對於特港所成立之協議，就其性質言，初未曾對特港問題有何解決，僅國際機構代管地帶，往往不但未能消弭問題於無形，且轉使問題益趨於嚴重；但　，麥梅爾均爲先例。此次外長會議對特港所成立之協議，以特港交付聯合國管制，雖足以表示雙方之讓步，然對此棘手問題，却未曾爲澈底的解決，徒貽將來之後患。何以對此問題未能爲澈底的解決？在英美則以蘇聯已席捲東歐而去，對於蘇聯之伸長不得不加以遏止；在蘇聯則以特港爲東中歐出海之主要港口，若得特港足以控制阿德里海，動搖英美在地中海之優勢，同時，蘇聯又欲取得義大利在北非之殖民地，是其用心，原具有深長的戰略意義。特港問題爲一種力的較量之試探。雙方堅持不讓，於是不得不在堅持之中，需求可以讓步之處。所以特港問題看上去似解決，而實際上仍爲解決。</p>
<p>自軸心敗降以來，這一年間的國際外交，處處顯着蘇聯與英美政策之不能協調。蘇聯在東歐獨拒暴敵，造成光輝的戰國，此自然容易引起蘇聯在心理上的優越感，基此優越感而睥睨一世，於是更進而積極伸展其勢力。凡此種種，自與英美的政策相衝突。政策爲思想之表現，英美與蘇聯間政策上不能協調，實由於思想上之歧異。吾人須記取蘇聯本身爲一種國際機構，其原名爲「蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯盟」，所謂俄羅斯僅爲構成「蘇聯」之一部；此項國際組織之目的，自不以包有沙皇帝國之疆土爲已足，其終極目的乃在全世界盡歸於「蘇聯」。軸心崩潰，蘇聯的軍備，達於空前強盛之域；在這個時候，蘇聯欲積極伸展其勢力，是應該可以瞭解的。美前駐蘇及駐法大使蒲立德在其近著「大地球的本相」一書裏，曾說：「今日威脅全世界之極權帝國主義，厥惟蘇聯是已。蘇聯之外交政策，乃在全世界樹立共黨獨裁制度。美國若不立即採取各項步驟，制止其滋長，即須向之屈服。吾人被全世界視爲泥足之巨人，惟吾人馬首是瞻之人民，已開始懷疑吾人是否足智多謀，堪當策劃自由與和平之工作；吾人賴有原子炸彈與龐大之空軍，故今日能較蘇聯爲強大，並能加以摧毀。但若因吾人知悉蘇聯政府意圖日後向吾人作戰，而先發制人，對蘇作戰，此種行動，將降低吾人之道德標準，與共黨成爲一丘之貉矣。」</p>
<p>蒲立德早期是個同情布爾雪維克革命的人，又曾任美國駐蘇大使，對於蘇聯自有很深的了解。他的發表如上的言論，雖不免有些過火，但對於蘇聯統治世界的雄心，他是知之有素的。這是這種思想上的根本歧異，使英美與蘇聯對於世界和平的重建有政策上的衝突。我們與蘇聯地讓相接，爲了世界的持久和平，我們總希望這種思想上的歧異和政策上的衝突，能够協調起來，使它們間的距離能够愈來愈小；因此，當我們講到貝爾納斯廣播的　了，看到他這樣說：「吾人並不以爲和平應以報復爲基礎，吾人所信者，爲真正無私寬大爲懷。吾人出以仁慈與憐憫，則可化敵爲友。吾人務必信賴和平，並祈求上主憐憫賜與世界和平。」不禁引起滿腔的同情熱淚。這工作室艱巨的；果能出以仁慈與憐憫，安知不可化敵爲友。向這樣一種虔誠的宗教精神感動我們；以這種精神來克服困難，應該是無有不成功的。我們謹向貝爾納斯滿致我們的敬意與讚佩，願他的努力成功！</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯演詞全文（續完）</h3>
<p>余承認在四月間舉行會議之前，余對於會議之獲得協議甚少希望；在四月會議以後，余所抱之希望更少。目下對五國訂立和平條約之前途已見光明。此等條約批准後之九十天，佔領軍必須撤退，惟保護交通綫者不在此例。屆時佔領國之人民能呼吸自由空氣而獲得自由人民之生活。吾人現正在回至和平之途上，余不欲向美國人民諱言四國政府對於在此等條約上調和意見所遭過之爭執與困難。吾人及吾人之盟國若果承認吾人之觀念，標準與方法之基本不同點，則吾人終必有較　機會從事解決吾人之問題。</p>
<p>德奧問題　此次會議對於義大利及其衛星國之和平問題，雖有直正之進步，但對於德奧兩國問題則毫無進步，或許討論所費之時間並非徒然，因吾人之經騐證明吾人與蘇聯友人之諒解，不能一蹴而就，吾人必須經過一番唇槍舌劍，重彈　調，重申立塲。余固深信蘇聯之不易諒解吾人，亦猶吾人之不易諒解蘇聯；但有時余以為蘇聯友人深恐彼等對於吾人所需要之一切，若不爭辯而即表同意，則吾人將視彼等為軟弱，故不得不故意作梗。然不斷之爭執對一希望永久和平之世界，亦非幸福。蘇聯以事前擬就之聲明開始討論德國問題，吾人所建議之條約草本原為保證繼　解除德國武裝至少廿五年，而蘇聯之聲明對於保證德國不再　　蘇聯與歐洲安全之條約，竟堅持反對，余不行蘇聯能明瞭其冷淡與仇視態度在友好國家思想中所引起之懷疑。美國所建議共同保證繼續解除德國之武裝一舉，原為對蘇安全董想之善意的建議。在第一次世界大戰後，美國若為此種保證之當事人，則第二次世界大戰決不致發生，而蘇聯亦不致遭受攻擊與蹂躪，德國之請武主義豈能作東西兩方爭鬥之小卒？德國之　武主義豈能再使其獲得各個擊破之機會？蘇聯方面稱：吾人所建議之條約不適當，不能保證德納粹主義之消滅與民主主義之招頭，不能對蘇保證陪償；但此等皆屬政治問題，　已在波茨坦協定中論及之。</p>
<p>軍事協定　吾人所訂一九四六年六月五日之軍事協定，規定立即解除德軍武裝，並消滅其戰爭工廠之軍事能力。吾人所建議之廿五年修約，意在德國一經解除武裝，吾人將注意其不再披上武裝，吾人不明蘇聯反對之理由安在？尤其史達林元帥對於此事已於去年十二月廿四日在原則上表示同意。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表渠已接獲報告，英軍佔領區內之解除軍備工作並未實施。英國代表則謂據報告：蘇軍佔領區內之德國工廠現仍開工。吾人要求管制委員會調查此項報告，並加以證實。英法兩國代表贊同此項辦法，惟蘇方則不同意調查之議，除非此次調查工作僅限於解除軍備方面。余確曾在巴黎會議初期中指出；德國解除軍備，僅係解決德國問題之一部分工作。當時余即建議，在最近之會議中余再度建議各國指派代表，推展解決全部有關德國問題之工作。英法兩國贊同此項建議，蘇聯則反對之。蘇聯建議各國應召開一商計德國問題之特別會議，余對之表示同意，並堅持確之召開此一會議之日期。惟就余對義大利及巴爾幹問題之經騐判斷，深恐蘇聯若不派造代表與各外長保持密切關係，並致力研討同意與不同意各點，果如是，則各外長交換錯棕複　德國問題之意見，尙嫌不够。吾人已無須諱言，如就各强之軍事觀點言，四强劃區管制德國實非盡善盡美之辦法。</p>
<p>經濟方面　按照波茨坦宣言，在經濟方面，德國應為一整體，吾人應設立一中央管理部門，以達成此項目標。惟事實上德國已被分化為四個區域，各區人民間之動向，貿易，及思想已受嚴密限制，其情形已有甚於各獨立國之間。結果各區均難自足自給，吾人用於美軍佔領區者，每年達二億美元，吾人及其他佔領國家雖肩起重大之金融負何，德國仍遭受通貨膨脹及經濟麻　之威脅。此種情形並不繼續。在巴黎會議中，吾人建議訓令管制委員會設立中央行政機關，以便管理德國，作為一經濟單位，並籌備各區產品之交換及進出口之平衡計劃。以前原反對設立中央行政機關之法政府，表示願接受吾人之建議。英國亦表示同意，但蘇聯則稱不能同意將薩爾區　絕在外，因此無法進行。余曾聲明吾人對於德國之經濟麻　，及長此以往下可避免之痛苦情形，不願分負責任，於是余遂宣布最後辦法，吾人準備在吾人之佔領區，作為一個經濟單位，子以管理。</p>
<p>美方建議　余曾說明最近吾人對於若干問題，曾獲得英蘇佔領區之合作，余說明吾人之建議，並非欲分裂德國，而乃使其合而為一·余稱：對一國政府所作之任何協議，其他政府準備參加時，亦得在同等條件下加入在內。英國稱：彼等將考慮吾人之建議，並表示希望能予以同意；但蘇聯與法國則均不表示意見。我國駐德軍事代表將於本星期內接獲訓令，對於各種重要行政事務，如財政，運輸，交通，貿易及實業等，將與三國政府中任何一國政府或全體合作。最後，我人論及　國問題，六月一日余發出草約一則，承認奧國之獨立，並規定佔領軍之撤退。英方將草案提付討論，余則請求任命各外長代表草就條約，蘇方提出反建議兩點：（一）採取進一步行動，保證奧國納粹主義之完全消除。（二）撤退　境內大批無家可歸之流民，據稱彼等對蘇極不友好。英法雙方均願意與我人採取一致行動，將條約提交各外長代表考慮，並請求管理會就消除納粹主義及難民兩問題進行調查，並報告其進展之情形；但蘇聯代表在此兩問題未有實際行動前，不願同意各代表起草奧國和約。</p>
<p>奧境難民　我人承認此項問題之嚴重性，　力設法解決之，難民問題尤難解決。在難民同意下，我人助其返國；但許多人拒絕返還本國，因深恐政見之不同將致其於死命，或陷其於獄中也</p>
<p>我人保護政治犯之傳統，極可珍貴，不能同意將此華人民集體自我方區域中逐出，聯合國已有特種委員會，研究此項問題，我人將繼續努力覓得解決；但此種解決，不　成為一種殘忍的解決，致使美國人民不再為人信任。展緩與奧簽訂和約將引致悲慘之結果，因奧國在流亡政治人十之未能在他國獲得歸宿前，奧國實為彼等之臨時居留地。吾人應於會議中堅守吾人之立塲，務使戰爭病痛之世界恢復和平，並令海外士兵返回其祖國及家庭，化干戈為　　。戰爭已使世界遍體鱗傷，吾人亟應治療此項創傷。吾人並不信任基於復仇願望之和平。吾人信取正義，寬大與慈愛。吾人如以寬大與慈待愛人，吾人之敵亦將成為吾人之友。吾人　遵循和平進　，並　告上大一本其慈悲之懷，以和平賜與世界。</p>

<p>商業新聞調整用電辦法後　棉紗成本加四十萬　紗廠利潤大減原因有三　　〔本報訊〕記者爲明瞭最近紡織業之情形起見，昨特趨訪申新舫織公司總經理榮鴻元氏，承吿：外間迭傳民營紗廠利潤優厚，實非確訊。綠一月之前，因一般生產條件尙佳，故確有相當利潤。惟最近情形已逈非昔比，發厥原因：（一）原棉頻漲，以廿支原棉價格面言，每担已自八萬元步漲至十二萬元。且前途趨勢仍屬上漲，故原料成本，日見加重。（二）工人生活指數激增，影影所及，使原已不勝負担之勞工成本，更趨惡化。（三）電費增價，電量减少。綠自六月份起，經濟部燃料管理委員會對紗廠用電價格，已提增一百五十倍。而用電量則經規定每週至少停用二日。此項規限，徒使紗廠生產量减少，而生產成本則扯大。綜上三點所述，可見民營紗廠最近生產條件，已每况愈下。實未能奢言利潤。旋該公司業務科長榮錫增氏語記者稱：最近變更用電辦法及調整費用之結果，每件紗少生產成本，無形扯漲約四十萬元。此外，產紗一件，須原棉三担半，約合成本四五十萬元。勞工，物料，及利息等支出，約四十萬元。各項機器設備之折舊約二十萬元。故產紗一件之成本，已逾一百萬元。實際利潤，每包不過一成左右。外界所傳之對本暴利，實屬不確云。金鈔均疲　　烚赤昨更爲平庸，起仆有限，交易零散，晨開一九四萬五，開後微挫至一九三萬五，十時後中央配出四六條，價一九四萬，此後始終在一九四萬左右盤旋，迄午刻仍乏變化，午後現交微降至一九三萬二，隔日交割又微升至一九四萬以上，結果較前收下挫六千，飾金念萬〇六，紋銀銀元平穩，銀根更鬆，息價退至一角半以下。　　外幣由穩略平，美鈔自晨初二五〇元賣價起，逐漸微挫，午刻退至二四六〇元左右盤旋，午後微穩，結果較前收又挫十五元，港票亦形平定，結果回小六元，港匯六六〇元至六七〇元，印匯六八〇元六九〇元，英匯九千至九千一，均較前日微挫，交易亦少，美匯仍無活動。　　公債微升　　　　公債昨穩定逾恒，統丙自八五〇元開盤後，微吿上升，而以九四〇元結束，交易閑散？缺乏大變，結果較前收微升一二〇元，甲乙各被帶上六〇元，丁戊亦好八十元。桐油出口數量　　本月僅及上月六成　　〔本報訊〕頃據此間經濟部中國植物油料廠語本報記者，本月份桐油出口，因內地各處霉汎大水，運輸阻阨，致出口數量勢將銳减，僅及上月份百分之六十，按上月份桐油出口數量爲三千七百噸。　　推廣出口關鍵在於改善運輸　　浙皖桐油產區價格，依照目前出口價格論，如運費不昂，則內地積滯之桐油即可源源出口，滬地出口桐油價格，亦不致因外價之影影，過分壓低桐農之生產成本，據浙皖方而來滬之桐油運銷商人稱，桐油從山地運送至出口海岸，其間運輸情形之困難，尤較戰時軍運頻繁之時爲甚，每批桐油之輸送，經過挑運，舟運，手車，而達於火車，其轉折愈多，運費自必愈昂，蓋目前內地公路運輸，路綫旣殘缺不全，車輛更寥若晨星，更無獸力足資利用，全恃人力作爲運輸中心，則當此米價高漲漫無止境之秋，人力亦即水漲船高，是以各方面咸望當局迅謀公路之從速修建，並能以救濟車輛，大量驅使內地，則不祇桐油一物，得以疏運出口，即其他出口土產，無不沐受其利，輸出數字，必可與時俱進。華茶外銷　出口茶葉商行　吸收各種花色　　本市華茶出口，目前雖仍陷於凋零狀態中，但邇來各種外銷花色，頗得買戶靑睞，均擬待機裝運國外，刻下英商協和洋行業已吸得陳祁門九十餘箱，在裕泰茶號進台灣次紅茶一百五十箱左右，新華茶葉公司扒進溫州新針眉五十五箱，市氣均形平定，至於內銷茶，値此盛暑中，去化踵趾相接，惟市勢變動殊微，價格大都與上日相仿。美報紙漲價　彌補外匯損失　　〔路透社紐約十七日電〕亞比蒂比紙廠昨日將其白報紙價格再提高百分之十，並發表通吿稱，此次漲價，係用以補償美幣外滙値减少百分之十所引起之損失。腸衣　美國提高收價　　廠商向皖贛收貨　　最近美國已將（27碼）腸衣收價提高至每副美金七角，市價亦頗俏利，滬地腸衣廠商雖對提高價格之消息殊爲興奮，然因貨款滙票郵遞遲緩，抵滬兌領至少需時一月，致廠商咸有堆貨候款，空耗拆息之虞，目前時入夏季，豬隻屠宰數量减少，因之鮮腸出貨亦减，又以江北一帶爲共軍所盤踞，來貨不便，若干腸衣廠爲適應國際市塲之需要，以免無貨應市計，在蕪湖，九江，南昌等地亦設有製造廠，隨地取材，從事製造運滬。貼息結價代替實物收解　華股投機熱度高漲　外股行市亦漲起一二成　　華股昨繼續蓬勃，金融界之實力派，均有局部活動，一般心理遂被激動，加之業中大戶有數家實行以永紗美亞爲投機籌碼，多空以貼息作價，代替實物收解，市價愈喊愈高，臨收在人為的做手下，仍以高價結束，晨初時低價永紗五三五元美亞三四二〇元，景福二三八元，新光二四三元，勤興二〇五元，入後逐步盤上，景福活動有人，中途即超越新光，終吿領導小熱，結果較前收計水紗升一成光景，美亞景福各漲一成左右，新光勤興升一成，較冷各股亦帶上一成左右，元老股仍逐步盤高。　　外股仍在邁進中，惟買戶較謹愼，漲風不逮華股，怡紗自一〇〇〇〇元，英聯一〇二〇〇元，開後逐步盤好，惟中途甚爲平和，結果較前收除亞洲仍因在港開拍，以港幣計算等傳說，買氣最殷，激漲二成外，餘者各升一成左右糖價依然堅緊　　昨糖市以現貨仍缺，依然堅緊，但現在所劃者尙係上期所開九萬八千元及路貨九萬五千元之中砂白，再加棧租拆息，均需虧本，傳本週六將實行平價，凡八萬元所進之貨，應售八萬六千元，似乎尙能顴到事實，然隨進隨出，可能得到相當利益，如墊銀四五日再行出售，則去息後所得亦徵，此不可不知者，公會劃盤現貨廿號中砂白初爲九萬八千元，後爲十萬元至十萬〇一千元，升六千元許，棧單九萬元至九萬一千元，號貨有潮帮開出冲提靑六十包，七萬九千元，黃嵩青七萬七千元至七千五百元，計百餘包，棉赤四十包，十萬〇三千元，興化帮開出興赤五十簍，十萬元至十萬〇二千元，建帮開出刁靑七萬八千元，此種土糖，開價均與產價背馳。配售食油　下週可恢復　　經濟部中國植物油料廠，每週配售生菜油，本週因內有少數商店屆期多未如約提貨，致暫停配售，該廠茲特予新商店加入機會，並將以前未如約提貨商店一概予以取消，故編號須重新整理，聞下星期一起，即可恢復配售。糯米枝獻新　　糯米枝首批新貸，已有少數運到，以屬初次獻新，頗覺稀罕，開至六十萬元，陳貨較軟，開四十三萬元，後市多到當可望略鬆，惟聞本屆產量不多客貨來源通暢　米價漸次下降　　最近一般客商以運米來滬，脫手獲利可觀，乃各加緊採運，因此日來客米運滬數量大見增加，米商辦貨亦較過去便利，現已向蘇皖各地採辦者據非正式估計，爲數當在十五萬至二十萬石左右，大致可能於本月內次第運抵此間，昨日南北米市塲共到客米一萬零四百七十五石，內計北市塲四三七七石，米商自運自銷一九七三石，南市塲四一二四石，市况呆滯，高貨稀少，惟中下等苦無受主，價續跌一二千元，尙乏交易，白元亦然，回小二三千元，麵粉以無錫來貨居多，店銷不振，步跌三四百元，油市潮州略有問津，市形仍趨挺秀，續加千元，豆餅日上漲之後，納胃見懈，回疲三四百元，麩皮平正，黃豆汕頭停辦，止漲轉跌，回小五六百元，蠶豆依然少神，勢難生色，生仁黃蔴平站，菉豆呆滯，赤豆下游，小麥外埠消化動而不旺，價格續疲三四百元。　　利多空氣濃厚　紗價繼續上升　棉布續挺花交轉稀　　昨日紗市漲風益熾，晨初開市時，即爲買氣所籠罩，廿支紗續升二萬至五萬元，雙股綫有織廠及同行吸收，狂跳八萬元之多，因昨日市塲上利多空氣特盛，美國禁止美棉出口一也，以煤易電，紡紗成本增高，二也，紗布出洋之禁令即將解除，三也，在在足以助漲紗價之高翔，人心因是益堅，午時紡建公司照例掛牌，開紗價亦較上期標高二萬至九萬。　　昨日紐約美棉電訊回跌四十五至五十磅音，計近期美金三四·七三，遠期三四。八五，米特林三五·三四，本埠現棉價俏交平，因執貨者不願輕易脫售，以致談判不易接近，交易轉稀。　　坯布續挺，因上日紡　分配之貨，數量不多，同時客方稍有潑辦，於是人心向榮，　　漂布亦帶起，士林布尤昂，惟花布仍在疲境中，午後又昂，計坯布比上日漲五百元至七百五十元。證交經紀人申請書　下週起作初步審查　證券業公會提建議三項　　〔本報訊〕上海證券市場籌備委員會，昨日下午四時，假證券大樓三樓，召開第六次全體籌委會。出席全體籌委九人，及秘書陳績孫。當由主席杜鏞報吿經紀人及上市證券申請經過情形。迄昨日止，已發出經紀人申請書一千二百餘份及上市證券申請書一百餘份。至七時許，始吿散會。聞下週一（廿二日）上午九時起，將先由經紀人資格審查小組會三委員，將經紀人申請書逐份啓封整理，作初步之審查。通過後，將再交籌委會分組作第二步之審查。預計在二星期內，即可全部審查竣事。待送部核准後，對合格之經紀人，將頒發營業執照。至業經財經兩部批准之證交營業細則，現經發覺其中規定數點，因辦理時間及手續之關係，尙須提出請求，再予修正。又證交房屋之改造及內部設備等，昨日業已開標。經建築師提出審查報吿，證交擬與得標廠商，洽簽合同，即日開始動工云。　　又證券業同業公會曾去函證交籌委會，建議三點：（一）申請經紀人時，其中代理人一項，候經紀人資格核准後，再行申請。（二）申請爲法人經紀人者，審查手續，應特別嚴格。（三）應繳之保證金，對現金之部，希望酌减，同時增替代用品·籌委會昨已予以口頭中答覆。對第一點意見，認爲可予採納。對第二點意見，認爲原規定本已有嚴格之規定，應毋庸議。對第三點意見，認為證交章則，業經財經兩部核準在案，未便照辦。發電廠七座　即由美國運華　　〔路透社紐約十七日電〕商業日報戲稱：據吉爾培特聯合公司總裁宣佈，該公司頃與中國物資供應委員會簽立合同一紙，以便設計起建及經營中心發電廠七座，該項發電廠，聞將設於上海及中國境內之其他城鎭，爲中國工業區化中遠大計劃之一部，關於該計劃，另一部之供應設備訂立合同事，亦可望能隨之實現，聞此等電廠，將由美國製造家在西海岸港口裝配後，儘速運往中國，以便設立。美棉禁出口說探討　目下官方尚未能加以證實　如果實施其辦法當有兩點　　〔本報訊〕昨日據華東社訊，美國政府宣布禁止棉花出口。本埠市塲，亦有此項傳說，記者特以此訊，詢諸本市美國商務參贊，渠尙未能予以證實。據棉紗界消息：美國本年度棉花收穫不佳，故市價瀕漲。最近一月來，已漲起三分之一，計每磅自二角五六分，陸續步漲至三角五分。所幸美棉存底極厚，且美政府對美棉向採對外推銷政策，並有津貼辦法，獎勵出口。據臆測：美棉禁止出口之訊，其可能性不出以下二點：（一）獎勵津貼辦法取銷。（二）對申請出口證之手續，或較前加嚴。又證以昨日美棉市價，已下跌五十磅音之訊，則美棉出口，可能較前稍受限制，以便繼續抑低美國國內之棉價。惟衆信：即有出口限制，亦必屬臨時措置。一俟棉價趨平，此項限制，即可撤銷云。</p>

<p>夏令生活到高橋去　洗痛快的海水浴  用中　　勝利後的第一個夏天，喚起了海水浴場的美麗印象　　從北京路外灘水上飯店搭乘輪渡東駛，經西渡慶寗寺，東溝，的一小時左右抵達浦東高橋。高橋有海濱浴場，戰前高橋海濱浴塲每逢夏季曾風靡過多少洋塲兒女，這一類帶有西洋情調的玩意兒，最受出身洋學校的文明人底歡迎，但八年來的高橋，却被人們遺棄了。　　勝利以後的第一個夏天，在上海人的頭腦中重復喚起了高橋海水浴塲的美麗印像。　　記者昨晨六時半上輸，這時渡輪已搭滿了高橋去的遊客，女人們都是「海水浴裝」。美國頭罐，台爾蒙水菓，巧克力，花旗橘子，都是人手一包。高橋的鄕下人們的生意，也給美國曾搶了去，外國人比中國人多。　　從輪船靠岸到高橋鎭，還有半小時步行的路程，現已有公共汽車，但從高橋鎭到海濱，因公路橋樑尙未修復，祇有獨輪車和黃包車，車價到海濱至少要二千塊錢。　　高橋鎭上的生意人，都在這裏搭帳篷，做臨時生意。一杯淸茶賣五百元，租一頂帳篷遮遮太陽，要一千元一小時。規模較大的有太平洋旅行社　的臨時招待所，但是價錢大得唬壞人。　　還上海趁的是午後六點鐘的市輪渡，看見江海關大時鐘已是七點多了。夏令　美容談  哈德　　現在是夏令了，你要保持皮膚頭髮和容貌，必須要有特殊的洗濯方法和最新的美容術。夏季的炎熱，會妨碍皮膚和容貌的，所以你在洗濯的時侯，對於應用毛刷來洗濯皮膚頭髮和指甲，要很均勻，同時要用好的化裝品和新穎的技巧，然後能使容貌格外動人。　　每天早晨，必須將臉上以及頸部洗得很乾凈，不留一點塵垢，洗臉時必須要用溫水和肥皂輕輕地洗着，在皮膚還不十分乾的時候，塗上一層潤膚膏，從髮際一直到頸部，連頸後和耳後，也都要塗到，這時你可以從鮮檸檬裏擠出一點檸檬汁來備用，經過了擠檸檬的片刻時間，可以把方才塗上的潤膚膏洗下來，但不要完全洗掉，就用手指醮檸檬汁塗上，等略乾後，用手指輕輕地磨擦，這時乾的皮膚上會起一片小疱，但你仍須繼續的用檸檸汁塗擦，等到小疱完全沒有了，皮膚就會發生光澤而紅潤，晚上臨睡之前，也要洗一次，將白天的汗油洗去，再輕輕地擦乾，至臉色紅潤爲止，倘然你覺得皮膚太乾，那末洗臉之後也要塗上一層潤膚膏，到明晨再把他洗去。　　用檸檬汁和潤膚膏的方法，會使皮膚潔凈而健康，但你必須要邀守，每天晨晚用均勻和輕柔的手法，洗濯和塗擦，不可間斷。每天洗澡也會增加美麗，長保持你的靑春。淋浴，普通人是認爲華貴的，所以採用的也不多，也有人覺得淋浴不能够洗得很潔凈，盆浴雖然能伎膝蓋和跗部因受熱水所浸而不會硬化，但在美感方面說，盆浴總不很相宜的。在最初一星期內，洗浴時須先將一塊肥皂，溶解在水裏，再加幾滴香油，把他授勻，再等待片刻，讓水蒸氣散去一點，然後入浴，那你一定覺得異常的舒暢，再用長柄的浴刷擦凈背部和肩部，這樣可以洗去皮膚上的油垢，同時也可以促進血液的循環，浴後再擦以哥龍香水，這樣會使你變成一個最新式的美容家了。消去你一天的煩惱！！！　度夏夜  鼎　　要度過一個酷熱的夏夜，最理想的地方是外灘公園，坐在江邊的排椅上，望黃浦江上遼闊的水面和來往船隻，把你的胸襟也擴大了。　　夏夜裏的公園總是擁擠的，二十元的門票誰都出得起。可是你如果要找最標準的平民化乘涼所在，還是往高房子和馬路上去。國際飯店，蒲石路，華懋公寓，大新公司高大建築物的下面，沿人行道坐滿乘凉的人們。　　有人喜歡在夏夜蕩馬路，南京路嫌太擁擠，霞飛路靜安寺路一帶是理想的地方，馬斯南路綠樹成蔭，你會發現不少對情人在濃樹蔭下喁喁私語。在這兒附近有南洋飯店的夜花園，我發現這是一個非常幽靜的地方，連音樂也是幽靜的。你可以靜靜聆賞世界手維拉的鋼琴，一邊啜一杯可口可樂或是鮮橘水，可是道杯飲料的價目，都比外面貴十倍或十倍以上。此外，麗都，仙樂，新仙林，大都會等，是很多的。你如果是一個夏夜的眞正享受者，我勸你的二三千元錢在星期三或星期六之夜，到逸園去聽二小時的交響樂。即使你不懂，在舒服的帆布椅上打一個瞌睡也好。或者，坐在椅上，眼望滿天星斗，耳聽幽靜音樂，微風吹去你一天煩惱，你會覺着，生活竟是多美！世界第一　夏之都　紐約人怎樣消暑？  君默　　紐約可算是世界上最大的「夏之都」。每年夏季，必有大批的外省人和外國人到這繁華蓋世的地方來消暑。　　海灘奇景　長達廿六海里　　紐約也的確就有這麼多的玩意，可以供你過一個愉快的夏季假日。說到游泳，它有着達二十六哩的海灘，更衣間，淋浴，冷飲，餐室，一切的設備十分俱全，今年更已撥了大批的經費再謀擴充。夏日的海灘上，眞是一片奇景，每當下午，沙灘上盡是男男女女，遠望過去只見一片人頭，互相嬉戲，浪花飛濺。尤其是那舉世聞名的康南島上，眞是說不盡的旖旎風光，那裏一切玩的地方全有，有供兒童遊戲的大草場，有百花競放的花園，濃蔭夾道的小徑，有夜總會，有咖啡店，歡笑之聲，洋溢遐邇。　　如果你喜歡運動，活動活動筋骨，那末紐約的公園裏，多的是網球塲和高爾夫球塲，玩個把鐘頭，洗一個澡，正可換得滿身凉爽。　　紐約也有專爲夏季遊　用環的市公共汽車，坐位實敞，玻窗明凈，它可以帶你去遊一遊許多你從未有機會到過的地方，尤其是近郊。除了汽車，還有遊艇，沿赫德生河兜一個圈子。夜間也有遊覽的專艇。月光下，微波上，駛艇子，眞是件賞心樂事。動靜咸備　隨你喜歡什麼　　如果你愛熱鬧，可以去玩玩摩天樓，或者站在紐約時掃廣場前，望望來來往往的車輛人群。如果你愛靜，那末，有的是博物院，古色古香的幽靜建築，有樓廊，有音樂院，可以給你一種藝術的安寗。　　說到吃，紐約也是應有盡有，隨你喜歡什麼。有道地的中國菜，有冒牌的中國菜，也有熱得燙舌頭的俄國茶。吃過晚餐，紐約有無數好的戲院，好的夜總會，好的舞廳。　　紐約，也和上海一樣，它什麼都有，只要你能知道如何去安排。如果你能够懂得安排，那末，在家裏過夏天一樣是很好，何必要辛辛苦苦地跑到別處去呢？晴波輕帆　（消夏生活，紐約時報攝）夏之味覺　冷飲不如游泳  絮才　　在酷熱的暑天裏，你一定要比夏大的太陽起的更早，因爲這是你工作最好的時間。把一天中應做的事情先計劃一下能够做的儘量的先做好。注意！你必須要騰一部分時間出來，預先製備你愛食的冷飲。情凉劑是夏令時節所不能缺少的，然而今夏霍亂流行，不是出之於親手的冷飲品，千萬少吃爲妙，何况要製備些價廉物美的飲品在今年還不困難，講究一點的，可以買一點美國罐頭水果作爲原料，不然，備些菓子露，甚至買一點凉菜，都可以製成絕好的冷飲，足够調劑你一天中的炎熱與疲勞了。　　其實，要逃避酷熱的襲擊，任何冷飲店都不會比游泳池更理想的！假使你的工作，能够在午後三時吿個段落，那你還來得及趕上虹口的游泳池。你要靜靜地泡在水中，不要化太多的氣力，因爲這會使你疲倦的。也不要晒太久的太陽，因爲這會讓你皮肉焦黑破裂的。更不要忘記，在臨走的時侯，洗個乾凈的淋水洛，因爲這可以省去你回家洗澡的時間。夏季旅行　好風景向人們招手  家南　　隨着樹葉從翠綠變成深綠色，盛夏天氣已經再度光臨。戰前美國人是極喜歡在夏天到風景優美的地方去消磨一二個星期。試想在水色淸冽風浪不驚的湖上，駕起一葉輕舟，在挺秀的山峯之間，任意蕩漾，豈不是人間天堂？美國人這種習慣，經過數十百年的薰陶，已經是根深蒂固。在戰爭期間，爲了工作的繁重以及物質條件的限制　，消夏的旅行曾經中斷過一個時期。但是現在，在勝利後第一個夏天，凡是有機會可以一廣心胸的，誰肯放鬆這個機會？　　戰前美國人到歐洲去遊覽的很多，可是目前，爲了渡洋大輪被軍隊徵用之後還沒有交還，或者交還之後還得改裝的原故，一時還不能作遠渡重洋的旅行。此外，歐洲糧食的困難，也使一般人裏足不前。　　但是除了歐洲，可以一走的地方還多得很。就在美洲本土，也還有多世外桃源可以供遊人發掘。譬如加拿大，墨西哥，美國西部，太平洋沿岸以至南美各國，都是汽車兜風，狩獵，垂釣，駕輕舟的好地方。事實上，思想敏捷的美國商人，在今年春天就把注意力集中到這方面，大吹大擂地從事實傳工作了。　　但是在今年夏天旅行，還不能像想像中那樣會舒服，設備特別舒適新穎的為車，輪船，汽車和飛機，要到夏季以後或者明年才能為遊客服務，同時今年旅館中的空房間也特別少，決心到某地方去旅行的人，事前必須去寫好房間，以免臨時向隅，原來美國也在鬧着房荒啊。　　事實雖然如此，美國人是決心要出外去了，五年來的緊張情緒，無論如要給它宣洩一下的。據說，美國各國立公園預料可以吸引遊客二千五百萬人。各遊覽區正忙於籌辦釣魚，泛舟，游泳等等設備，務必使遊客稱心滿意。新英格蘭預料有遊客三百五十萬人前來，打破已往的記錄。而加拿大官吏，正在邀請遊客到遼闊的北方去，因爲那裏和大城市不同，決不致有人滿之患。　　盛夏已經隨着樹葉從翠綠變成深綠色而到來，美國人中有假期可以享受，大多己經在整裝待發，把窗戶繫起來，前門鎖起來，優美的風景在他們或她們招手，夏季的大移民即將開始。杲杲驕陽　炎炎長夏　上海人到何處去？  培林　　說實話，今年的夏天眞是特別熱，晒在火熱的太陽下，走在炙腳的馬路上，擠在擁塞的電車中……滾滾的熱浪汗臭的氣味，煩躁，窒悶，實在難受。　　上廬山，莫干山，北戴河，靑島等地避暑，只要有錢就可以。留居上海的是否有消夏的去處呢？　　上海原是個享樂的天堂。滿街多的是冷飲室，戲院內有的是冷氣設備。夜花園，摩天樓，自然是乘凉的好地方。坐遊艇，去吳淞，黃浦江的風物，足够使你逍遙。高橋的海濱浴場，虹口的游泳池，是時代兒女不可不去的地方。再在家裏安置上電扇和電冰箱，便可足够排造道炎炎的長夏。平民大衆，在一天工作之暇，唯一消夏去處，似乎祗有化廿元錢門票逛公園，江邊閒眺，草坪悄坐，享受不需用錢買的自然風。到夜來，挾一條草蓆，往路旁一攤，便可仰天而臥，在夏天，他們的生活似乎更簡單，遙望摩天樓上輝煌的燈影，漸漸入夢，也可算是夠幸福了。美國浴女風姿（美國生活雜誌攝）夏令衛生　常識測驗  朱功　　關於衛生方面，你現今有多少智識；下面有五個問題，看你能够回答得出多少，就是表示你對於衛生智識的程度，假使你測騐的結果很壞，那末你必須要增加你的衛生智識。　　（一）下面那一種疾病是不能用人工來免疫的。1天花　2水痘3傷寒　4白喉　　（二）下面那一種疾病，一二歲嬰兒患了之後，死亡率要比麻疹，白喉驚風猩紅熱都高。　1壞血病　2百日咳　3副傷寒　4流行性感冒　　（三）配尼西林是怎樣產生的？　　1美國公共衛生局的一大成功　　2英國科學家費爾門所發明的　　3阿斯匹靈的副產物　　（四）下面那一種病是不會傳染的。　1癌　2耳腺炎　3黃水瘡4香港脚　　（五）瘧疾，黃熱病，天花，和傷寒和下面那一種情形相同。　1因爲給一種蟲咬了　2可以致命的　3可以預防的　　答案：（一）水痘　（二）百日咳（三）英國科學家費爾門發明的，（四）癌，（五）可以預防的。</p>

<p>出版界黃色刊物復活！  危言　　前幾火市府下了最大決心要實行瀟清本市一些有毒素的黃色刋物。所謂有毒素是指那些請淫詢盜，造謠非的成分。上海這地方在中國可算是文化祖當發逹的都市。可是這所謂文化郤是代表一種小資產階級的文化。趣味是服當低級的。一般小資產階級的心理一方面是有一部分空閒的工夫，需要設法消磨，一方面也肯花一點小錢，興越的所在多牛是聲色犬馬。有一部分黃色列物便是適應這種需要而產生的。　　刊物的發行而擁有一部分的搜者，這在文化事業上原是一件值得欣慰的事。同時在一個社會中要發展文化不作，就怕沒有人育推動這種　神的事業，更怕沒有羣衆來擁護。所以我們覺得發行小型刋物的本身並不是一件壞事。不過，在上海的這許多刋物往往只求迎合低級趣味，保持刊物的銷路，而不擇手段，在內容方面便不斷報導的翔賓和社會的風氣。還是要對於民情習尚發生惡影響的。所以市府決心肅清，這確是善政。　　近幾天我們又看見這些黃色刋物在報攤上復活了。當然這已是得到市政黨局的許可。好在我們在原則上也并不是反對上海的文化界出版刋物，不過我們希望這些列物還要提高興趣的水準，用一種輕鬆有越的筆調，正角的，翔寶的傳播一切有關國祭或國內的政治經濟社會的情形。至於暴露社會的黑暗，評說常政的得失，這米始不可，不過言論要絕對負責任，動機要完全純正。至於管理出版的當局一方面要尊皺人民言論的自由，一方面要注意到它們的內容，務期其成功一稱有益的教育工具，希望官方不要祇是注意法令上的乎續而已。我和敎育  張文郁　　舒新城原著　中華書局印行　三十五年二月初版　　「我和教育」是一部自傳體裁的著作，作者用二十萬字來寫述自一八九三至一九二八年問的教育和著述的生活。我們先從中國近代歷史來分析，一入九三至一九二八年正是中國的文化由古老刻建轉向革新洋化的時期，無論從政治經濟，思想，學術各方而觀察，都她一個偉大的變革時期。作者的幼年和少年是生活在這樣一個時代背景之中，耳聞目觀和親身經歷着教時的教育環境，把這些情形籌之於醫，這醫便不僅是作者的自傳，而更可反映出常時的教育情形和一般人對於教育的觀念了。　　作者為什麼要寫這本書呢？作者在「叔文」中說：「凡區與我個人有關的教育事集，教有經驗，教育見解，教育理想，教育方洗，以至於個人敎育經騐，都可以自由地講出來，供大家批許。」（二十年十二月）作者在「寫完以後」中設；我現在還想用文藝的描寫方法，寫幾部「我和什麼」以表現我幼年，少年，壯規，中年，的全部生活。」（三十年七月）又在「付印小記」中說：我以文字為活已三十餘年，自間所能遺留於社會者只有文字，哉今日仍存此頣，且擬以餘年暮心寫作，以期完遂此願！」（三十五年一月）　　作者生於一八九三年五月，在一個小農社會瀰漫着封建思想的家庭環境中長大，母銳想使他田讀者而太得功名，未滿五個歲就在故鄕—湖南淑浦劉家渡——私藝入學，私熟生活也有幾次變動，由劉家私藝到胡氏家館，一龍王江私熟，廻龍閣私塾，張氏學義。最後，由私熱生活轉變為書院生活—廊　書院。一九〇八年秋天，因書院改為學校，作者便與書院告別，轉入縣克高等小學堂。在高小時代，作者曾參加小學教員檢定而做過初小教負。一九一一年，即武昌起義鄧年的冬天，作者和賀菊端女士結婚。民國以祿，元年入常德築二師範，「一年春人長沙游學預備科，同年夏入琥昌文華中學。同年秋轉入獄麓高等師範，在誰麓四年，結束了作者的學生生活。作者的教師生活，初期的嘗試是在一九一一年的夏大，那時因鬧革命而為高小開除，不得不在學館裂敎體操和算學。但真正的開始是一九一七年春天在兌澤中學任教昔樂。一九一八年夏大，潤南基習教教育聯合會舉辨暑期講習班，作者擔任教育學誰師，是為作者研究教育的開始，作者級初受的影響是桑代克的「敎育學」和杜咸的「民主義和激育」。暑校結束、改任當時教會所辦的福湘女學教務主任兼教育科教師，也就在此時奠定教育著述的基礎；這時，作者的教青經騐是有了，學術研究的興噸也興富了，同時時代環境也給予作者一些影響，因為五四　動來了，新文化運動給了作者很大的刺激。一九一九邵十一月辭去福湘的職務，至一九二〇年六月在長沙從事著述，籌辦「徹南教膏月列」；不久，因湖南政局混亂便走上海了。作者到滬未兩月，湖南省立第一師範米滬聽請敎員，又把作者聘去任教育科教負。在湖兩一師只有一年，一九二一年九月又來上海任中國公學中學主任，在校遭遇兩次風潮，一九二二年作者在中公中學奠合志同道台的十徐人，作了不少事情：（一）行五年的能力分組制及選科制、（二）行六年的新學制，（三）訓育採輔導制，（四）體育採不作制，（五）設分科教室，（六）敎學採用道爾頓制，（七）賽行男女同學。一九二三年二月，作者學家還居南京，從事學術研究，賣文為生，並且過了一度演請的生活，藉以參觀江浙及長江洗城的若干中等敎育襪關。一九二四年十月，作者剛聘國立成都高師，東裝入川，任教育鄰利敎授，第二年春夏之間因「師生戀愛」一案，幾遇驚險，非常狼狠地離開了成都，重回上海，也就結束了作者的敎師生活。作者的寫作生活，最畢是一九一九年十一月，哪時是一些「劄記」，也嘗試作小說，作成「雪際血痕」和「田疇記」兩部。關於教寶著述的開始是一九一九年夏大，編寫「心理原理實用教有學」。一九二二年夏作者根據案代克的教育心理學編寫的「敎育心量學」由商務印書館出版。一九二三年五月「心理學初步」由中華書局出版。同年八月由華出版「公民課本」。一九二四年完成「人生哲學」一書。作者以介導道爾制出名，關於道爾頓制的著述有四：一九二三年五月的「道爾頓制概觀」，一九二四年三月的「道爾頓制討論集」，同年六月的「遺爾頓制研究笑」，同年六月的「道爾頓制淺說」（以上均中華出版）。一九三年十二月中華出版桑代克原著作者譯的「個性論」，一九二四年十月中華出版莫爾原著作者譯的一現代心理學之趨勞」。一九二五年十月中華出版「教育業稿第一案」。一九二七年寫成「蜀進心影」．以上，作渚均名之為副業。那末，正業是什麼呢？作者的理想和計劃是：「創立一稱以勞力自活而與學者其同工作互相礪紙的私人學院」。為了創辦學院。作渚計劃以著作收入作為解決觀濟問題的工具。但是，作者的理想永遠沒有完成，學院沒有辨起來；一九三〇年元旦就任中華書局編輯所所長之後，只能使作者在編輯出版方面努力。但關於敎育約著作絡續由中華出版；譯出柏克赫司特的「個別作業與道兩頓制」（一九二五），一中國敎育辭典」（一九二八），「中華直科辭黃」（一九三〇）。「敎育通論」（一九二六），﹁現在敎育方法﹂（一九三〇—商務），「近代中國敎育史料」（一九二六），「中國新敎育槪況」（一九二七），「敎育指南」（一九二五—一九二六），「近代中國留學史」（一九二七），「近代中國教有思想史」（一九一二九），其他的一些教育論文。這是作者的敎育著述生活。　　這本自傳式的著作，敘述三十五年的敎育生活，反映祇會，揭示現賓，對於中國新教育的發展，作一客觀的史的描寫，我們不應該把宅看作個人的自傳。作者所體騐的一種「無限自覺創造」的人生見解，尤值得我們去體騐。讀過枯燥乏味的敎育史料之類的書籍，想找一本新穎興趣同時又有價值的近代敎育史書的，我極願意推薦這本書。新時代的兒童  平　　Arnold　Ｇessell，Francis　Ｌ.Iig　and　Otliers：Infant　and　Child　in　the　Culture　of　Today.New　York　The　Macmillan　Macmillan　Coillan　Co，pp　399，1943，14.00　　本書是用一種通俗清晰的文字描寫兒童從生下來到五歲為止的心理發展。書裹面附有六十五幅圖畫來說明人生前五年行為發展的過程。這個過程著者們把它分成十二個階段。每一個階段的特性和發展趨向都有一個圖表，使人看了一目了然。潔個圖表是根據測量結樂所得的專實，並且給看獲兒童的人們許多實際的指導。在每一個圖表後面有一段「一日之行為」，其中詳細說明如何看護道一個階段的兒童的睡眠，飲食，排洩，等項。　　這十二張行為發淡的圖表，常我們依照秩序讀下去的時候，可以看得出人類的發表乃是述串一氣的。這種說明很能帶助我們實際的淅管兒童。同時它吏能使我們得到一個吏重要的結論—即一個兒童早年發展的特衛頗能使我們看得出他一生的傾向。著者們主張家事乃是一種文化工作，假使我們是根據每一個見童自己的特性和需要去看管他，我們就能培植出一種民主的生活方激。家庭是每個人個性發展的根據地，因此，我們對於兒童第一年的發育要特別的注意。十八個月之後，兒童的行為便向外發展而超出了家庭的節圍。這個時候兒淤也許要被送入托兒所。於是著者們在此地便詳細的討諭到托兒所的各方面。　　本書最後有一個附錄，其中列舉了每一個階段兒童所可能玩的玩其，並給予兒童指導者許多關於指導兄章的書籍，記錢和材料。本害是培養新時代兒童的南針，心對於做母親的和托兒所的看護們她一個很大的貢獻。南洋與西北  王成組　　三年，由正中覆局等處經售。西北區域地理是由商務印電館在三十四年發行重慶初版，三十五年發行上海妝版。）因此兩書的作風臀然相問。對於南洋與西北各地的各孫地理資料，搜集書都相當戰富，因此結於一般的參考，很是便利。西北一書的末尾，而且附有群細的參考書目。全書者一是採用分區的敘述，而各區所敘述的門類，又是一大致相同，所以，對於分攔物閱的用處，尤其這宜。　　西北是我國邊疆地帶的重要部份，南洋是筆益繁殖的地區，對我們都有切身的利害。因此我們對於這些地帶的谷種情彫，特別應當注意。這兩方面的情形，在戰後造是在動　之中，書中所述，有些不免已經事過境遷。然而這一點不足為病，好在政治上的重大戀化，是通常所易於注意。至於經濟變化，來來提勢，一時還難以穩定，只好根據以前的一責料，作為比較研究的根據。由於印刷上的困難，插圖都不能製版印出，真是一種遺憾。但是在分區的地理著作裏面，分區的界劃地置是一種不可少的參考根據。隙君在南洋地理一書，對於南洋的若干區，都備有詳細的分區地圖，很是便利。不過讀者宜於另用較詳細的地岡，尤其先地形圖，參照細看，才能領路分區的真諦。西北一書除去分區總岡之外，對於各區之內的加詳分劃，雖則書中有許多部份採用，別無一圖表示，未免多一缺陷。　　也詩是作者為着避免一般的讀者感覺枯燥，兩書對於分區的根機請得非常簡略。同時對於各種地理景家的分區特黴，以及仙們的成因，在學理上的攘討與給論，也只不過偶而見到。然而對於一般讀者，如果只要查考谷地方的各稱情形。　　近來看到雨木地區　　，一本　南洋地理，一本是西北區域地理，同是由央大學陳正祥君的作品。（南洋地理一書據蘭後記是成於一九憫〇年終，但免發行的初版是三十竇料頗為慶博。南洋一書有少數地名與學術名詞。米具中文　名，對於不誠文的讀者，恐怕稱有不便。　　書中很有許多崗有意味的賢料。例如關於菲一列賓的懿革出產，驚到Caga他，谷地（此處原一文未用謬名，濱即是一例）下游近海的部份，質量都不及谷地中部，因為受得到海風的吹拂，菸草便會減少牠的香味和刺激性。關於大戈麼南邊的草原地帶，盤翠頗有進展，而日久都不免徒勞無功，反而迎得畜嚴馭也受損害。這些都儿土地利用上的重要問題。西北一書中對於谷區發展計劃，誤是注震，凡是關心於開發西北的人士，尤其應當發生興味。　　一部份資料，似乎稍有問題。例如南洋一書中，關於馬來亞各邦的糾織，說明得非常簡略，一般讀者恐怕並不能因而隙解他們的政治地位的差別。關於爪哇的蔗糖，似乎忽略了十餘年來的盛衰變遷。同類物產的數字單位，或用公噸，或用公担，並不劃一，恐怕也易於使讀者發生誤會，就是引用的數字似乎也因而稍有可疑乏處。對於南洋羣島中的英屬地，竟變字不提，未免過於疏忽。　　西北一書，在自然地理方面，資斜更其　富。這顯然是由放各國專家的考察，向來較為偏重於自然方面，而在人文方面贅料未免散碎，或則偏重於同部。但是其中也有許多常有典味的問題，例如關於道一帶在歷史上的氣筷變化，或是像塔雄木河水道的遜機以及牠的影饗。一般人以為西北的情形，竟是簡單得沒有多少可講，本書可以算得一個很好的反證。中山先生之教育思想  朱家慶　　著者　張志智　出版　正小響局　　我國在這忙界激育思潮錯線複雜的時候，正是陷於無所適從的苦悶。要挽救我國目前教育的危機，就應誠怎檬去建立一種週應我國國策的教育哲學—怎樣從我國立國精神中去提煉出一種建設性的教育思想體系。中國是以三民主義為建國的最高原則，所以我們應該有一種符合這個最高原則的教育理論，作為建設新中國的一個基石。　　本文是介紹張志智綸著的「中山先生之教育思想」一書。本書是他從中山先生的思想體系中所抽繹出來的關放教育的部分。全書雖僅八十八頁，但對放中山先生的激育思想精義，發揮殆盡。誠為我們負蕭違國使命，研究教育思想，從事教育工作的人們的一個南針。爰將內容，略述如次：　　一，近代中國敎育失欺的原因—敎育沒有一貫的中心政策，沒有一貫的教育制頗；以及不適於我國的政治經濟與社會的背景：這都派教新教育施行失敗們癥結所在。我國過去受了列強的堅迫，得到了創痛的教訓；才覺悟到教育必須改變。於是什麼「方言敎育斗，什麼「國防教育」等，五花八門，不一而足。因為沒有一貫的中心政策，就沒有一買的教賈制度。以致教育法令，朝發暮更，教育形態，朝奏暮楚，紛亂異常。而同時我們在上面既然承認了政治穗濟社會與教育有深切的關係；那末就訂以推理到：教育的目標，就是政治的月標；教育的中心思想，也就是政治的中心恩想。三民主義的實現，既經國父定為我國政治的目標；所以我們夢研究我國的敎育目標，不能不研究中山先生的教臂思想。　　二，三民主義的基本精神——中山先生的教育思想，在艮族主義方面：義義教育必須充分遷感英對於良族所負的使命——　廷我國固有的文化；同時必須堅強其共同意認，圍結共民族力量，恢復其民族地位。當然的，民族主義教育，第一要培養民族精神，保存與發揚我國固有的文化與通德；進而堅強其共同意識，團結其民族力量，而底成於民族地位的恢復。在民權主義方面：主張教育應以全民為對象，而不可以階級為對象；必須勵行普及教育，實現教育機會平等的理想；更須培菱奮爭民權的意志，與養成有養用長權的知能。在民生主義方面：主張教育第一應了解產業演進的程序。中山先生說；「民生為社會進化的重心；社會進化又為歷史的重心。」這句話的意義，在今日我們更應該予以澈底的理解，並且予以普遍的發揮。第二應明白人類的生活原素：那就是關於衣食住行等各個生產其消耗問題的研究。第三我們知這人類消耗的終極目的，還是在於生產：而耳民生主義教育就是一種生產教育，那當然應該注意全產知能的培養，生紊知能是謀生的重要工具，所以也是敎的最大目標　　三，知難行易學說—我們要使人人以服務為目的，那對終服務這惆活動的「知」與「行」兩個方面，必須加以討諭。由此可見中山先生的知難行易學說，不僅是一種心理建設，而同時也是一種教育運設。知難行易學說的得徽是現代性，現代與古時的差異有二：（一）現代是科學的世界（二）現代是人羣結社的時代，所以知難行易這個學說，也可以被稱為「料學的」，或者是「社會的」。我們稱他是科學的，因為他有心理壓與生理學上的科學根據。同時知難行易學說是社會的，因為也有社會學上的很據。「因為知艱行易，所以要人人時刻不斷地去做，去宣行，因為行先於知，所以要人人行中求知。這種敎育理論卻又適與社威博　士（J.Dewey）的試騐主義敎育理諭不謀而合。杜威博士要我們「從做裘去學習」，也正是中山先生敎育思想的方法論。　　總之，知難行易的數育學說，就攤「主行生義的敎育學說」。主行主義的教育學說以「行」為始，以「行」為終的敎育歷程。主行主義的知識論，也是知識工具論：認為「知」不過是「行」的一種不具而已。同時知難行易或主行主義的教育學說，一方固是要人們按然天賦的能山，在實際生活中去探術真知藉照富的眞知去充實實際生活的內容。他方面又要人們運用意志作用來做行動基礎；使行動不致中斷，而逹到終極的目的。這就是中山先坐所說的：「有志者，事竟成」了。為孩子們寫一點  朱力　　在弄堂邊，菜塲角，常常看見一羣孩子圍着一個書攤，在他們津津有味的讀着。他們在讀些什麼呢？是一些早熟的色情故事，是一些大人的生活故事，是一些奇俠神仙的故事，……。這些書本，有粗俗的文字，有拙劣的圖畫。開心敎育的朋友見到了，感到「這是兒童敎育的問題」，一羣純眞的兒童訊着這些低級趣味怪力亂禮的讀物，在他們小小心靈上將被着一些怎樣的影響呢？——他們在生理和心理的發展上還不應該，還不能了解的事情，他們模糊地吸收了。這樣誘致他們有害的早熟，對於計會現角還分不清結或不對的時候，卻要他們含糊地去吸收一些是是非非的東西。於是，有些孩子要去學神仙了，有些孩子天天希望做使着飛劍的英雄，有些孩子想做威風凜凜的皇帝。這些有文字有圖畫的讀物正在怎樣執行它們的色敎育！　　我們無法禁止孩子去閱讀這些有害的讀物，同時，這些讀物，對於社會某階層還有它的效用：「無聊時消遺」。那末，我們應該怎樣呢？——我們希望關心兒童教育和兒童文化的朋友們為孩子們眞正盡一點力，給孩子們編寫一些讀物。自然，這些讀物應方着重敎育的意義，但不能缺少文學趣味。我們希望產生一些有合乎兒童心理的和饒有興味的文字　圖畫書。連環力書是很好的一種形式，版界非常不景氣的今天，出版商人敢不敢當試固然是一個問題，但是我們要曉得兒童讀者的數目不會少於愛好的新文藝的青年和成人的。漫談「北望園的春天」  鄭家環　　今年初春，第三期宇宙雜誌上，刋登了一篇相常「不短」的短篇小說！題目叫「北望園的春天」，作者署名「路賓基」！這個各字在我很是生疏；可是他這篇作品，卻給留下了非常好的印像：有一種獨特的筆調，流刋，舒緩，讀上去充滿了親切感。　　之後，我曾和幾個朋友提起它，除了知這騎賓基是一位大後方新進的年輕作家外，我們也曾對那篇小說有過不同的看法；有些人以為：他們風格艷見卓越，可惜太注震主罷以外小　節的描寫，不免過於　　；還有人說：他雖在道　小說裏，能給我們新頴的惑覺，若是循着老格式寫下去，這對作者不身，是非常吃　的，我的朋友，也許都和我同義的膚淺，欣贊文藝作品的時候！馮了一已的　覺和偏見，枉加批評，同時　僅僅注意到技巧方面的成就，把內容疏忽一盡；為種絕不客觀的態度，審實也可獎得很，然而，喜實上，我們卻都偏愛這湖篇小說的。　　三個月以據，一火，我在書報據上，無黨之中，發現了一本小見方的書　，白色封而上，印着錄色花紋，更用鮮艷的紅字，寫臢「北望關的春天」艷個字，這正是駱賓基的短籃小說集！我高興極了，趕忙買回來，連夜讀院　；直到那時候風才發現駱賓基決不是我們想像由鐵柔的，唯美的作者，他也會運用直截，剛愎的筆法，寫出一些沉痛，醜陋的故事來，令人觸目驚心：　　短簘小說集「北　關的春天」，計有八萬字左右，包含十個故事；（一）生活的意義；（二）莊戶人家的孩子；（三）鄕親——康天剛，（四）北犧園的春天；（五）紅玻璃的故事；（六）老爺們的故事，（七）一九四四年的事件；（八）一個坦白人的自述；（九）老女僕；（十）賀火傑的家宅。　　這裏面，以「莊戶人家的孩子」，「鄕親——賀犬剛」和「紅玻璃的故事」二期，取材於關東，俄羅斯和朝鮮交界處一帶，所以地方色彩渲染得很濃厚，這是在昔通一般作品上，很少見到的；也許作者本人自幼在那裏生長大，對放那然地方的習俗，生活方式，言語；世代傳灌的悲劇，有着清淅深刻的認識，寫來分外生生動。　　此外，其餘七篇故事的北景，是描寫抗戰時期，後方市鎮裏許多小人物們的逸事；在即段苦難辛酸的歲月中，人們困縛在狹小的囚籠內，沒有歡樂，苦悶地生活着，然後默默地消沉了！呀者，就在「爭執」和「憎恨」下，打發着日子過去，整灭困惑嘆息，發恕；精神上蒙受了不可救藥的麻瘁和殘廢；還有一些人，因為熬不住重壓，一個個就這樣死亡了！這裘，「北　園的春天」中的主人們，他們找不到一些晴期，溫暖，充滿了花香的「春天」！　　駱賓基的小說中，沒有曲折離奇的傳奇，沒有「設敎的口吻」，沒有「新文藝　」，沒有「濃厚的火藥氣」，沒有「偉大的愛情」更沒有「攻瑰花」，他所呈現州來的，全是一些平凡的事情，最眞實的生之動態；含着淡淡的悲哀，蹇運。有時候，他也願意把故事中的氣氛，調和得很靜葐，美妙，可是在這些光亮的東西下面，失望和哀痛，顯露得更殘酷了。……那些故事中的主角們，也許你曾經在四週的朋及中，看到過的，也許他們中的某一個正就是你自己的影子；在已往的日子裹，你也許為着替自已担心，洗盡了眼淚，而現在，心底的天，已漸漸地更黑下來了，他們疲乏憔悴的身影，已議糊不清，祇有那蹣跚腳步，沉重地在你的心板上慢慢踏過……。　　駱賓基有一種非常別緻，　婉的筆調，由下面一小段中我們可以看到一二：「……今天是七月一日了，桂林北望園的夏天該是怎樣呢？林美娜還是在掘蚯蚓嗎？若她那些難雛狀大了，那麼她在熊星睡着的下半天！作些什麼呢？她是從來不讀書的，也不看雜誌，那麼她的生活不是會有一段空白嗎？她會在這段空白的詩間，感到空虛吧………實在說北　園的男女住客，在無憂無慮的時候也不會寂寞，還會坐在走郎上打純呀—紅瓦屋子的客廳裹，申於花瓶那株美人焦的花朶，給他們幸福的點綴也一定不小，也許還有袾秋花掌呢！我懷念北望崗，懷念北望園的深夜……趙人傑一定還是　坐在他那陰暗的屋子裹暇想……現在北望國的深夜應該有一片蛙嗚了。」　　春天，已經早過去了，你懷念着馳嗎？不妨低下頭來，張望一下「北望園的春天」吧！牠也許可以帶給你一點消息！讓你在靜寂的詩候，思素片刻。</p>

<p>春秋霍普特曼逝世  趙景深　　據報載，六月中旬，德國大戲劇家霍普特曼已經在他的家鄕西里西亞逝世了。他生於一八六二年，是以八十五歲的高齡逝世的。　　翟普特曼的戲劇，我國似乎還不曾上演過，好像也沒有改譯本。但在新文學運動初期，霍普特曼的劇本介紹過米的卻不少。　　記得商務的世界　書中就有兩種楊丙辰的譯本，一種是「獺皮」，一種是一火焰」。此後陳家開譯有「織工」，商務早已絕版。描　國仁所譯「寂寞的人們」，也是商務出版的。孫溥所譯「沉鏡」，開明版。這是他的象微主義與自然主義復合的結磊品、也是他的代表作，差不多各國都有譯本，我國最早的文藝團體之一，甚至以「沉鐘」作為社名，林如稷陳物翻馮至等都是該社州社員。小說方面，也有王實味所譯的「珊拿的邪教徒」，中華版；郭沬若所譯的「異端」，便是這部小說的另一譯本。　　我國研究霍普特曼的專書還沒有，但小說月報第十三卷第六號裹希引人四篇文章，如果印單行木，也可以成為一本將返三萬字的小書。這四篇文章是「霍普特曼傳」「霍普特變自然主義的作品」「霍普特曼的象徵主義作品」以及「霍普絳變與尼采哲學」。希真火約是沈腦冰（茅盾）的筆名，劉大杰的「德國文學概論」（北新）對霍普特愛也有詳盡的介紹，楊冀侃女士（似即楊絳）等的「諾貝爾文墜獎金濩得者現代世界作家論」（漢交正楷印書局）中的霍普特曼部分就是很據劉著節寫的，與楊善同類的書是旅失肖的「諾貝爾文學獎金」，其中也有霍普特曼的奪章。此外可以拱給我們參考的是金祥森的三種著作：「德意志文學史」（文學業盡·商務）「備意志文學」（百科小叢書。高務）以及「現代德國文學思潮」（民衆文庫·華通）。北京大學德文米畢業的張傳普曾著有「德曉文學史大網」（中華）。李金髪的「德國文學ABC」中且節譯了一段「織工」。蔣啓藩的近代文學家」和孫俍工的「世界文學家列傳」也都有霍普特曼的俾略。這些書名的開列不僅可供給霍普特蔓的研究、也可以供給不懂西文的文藝愛好者研突德國文學之用。　　遺憾的是，霍普特最初的戲劇「日出之前」卻不曾有過譯本。抗戰八年間，不知後方有譯木否。手頭英文的參考書也不多。羅柏生的「德國文學」（家庭大學谿書本）云：「最有希望的新生命的記號可以在柏林費到，那就是獨立劇場，是幕仿法國的自由劇　而設立的。此劇場州始於一八八八年，第一本戲便是八十年代青年革命者所認為最有力的時代戲劇，易小生的「羣鬼」；羣鬼以後便是德國作家霍普特曼的第一部作品「日出之前」。……對於霍普特曼下一個定評頗為不易。用難在於他的傾向時常更變。他曾經嘗試過各咱不同的文藝形式．特別業戲劇，比同時代的任何作家都嘗試得多，他道個人是很容易受別人影饗的。他一方面受影饗，一方面卻又帶有強烈的個性，互為矛盾。例如，他起初寫非常寫實的戲劇，後來他與同時代的人又受了斯干底那誰亞人的影饗，結榮產生了文藝復活第一時期殺有力的戲劇「織工」。後來新神秘主戒席捲繫們歐洲，幾乎把寫賓主義迎根拔掠，霍普特晨又被新神秘主義迷住了。在「哈奈兒昇天」中。他創造了一個新的童話劇，寫實主義與幻想結合，寫很非常細緻。「沉鐘「差不多是寓言詩。絨回到較結實的寫實荔礎去的是「車夫亨來爾」和「洛塞本德」。霍普特曼走着他自己的路，時常逃避批評家對於他的願望，他在思想的潮流中尖銳的活着，但是，說老實話，並不及他以前幾種作品成功。霍普特曼是近一些年來的劇作是否可以在德國戲劇史上留不一些痕跡，是頗司懷疑的。晚年他已轉向於小說。他那奇怪的新世界的基音故事「苦因特寺院裏的瘋人」，不可秀認地充滿了想像力。」　　擺柏生的話似乎還算平正。但湯瑪士的「德國文學史」（一元帶書木）的話就未免有尖偏頗了。湯瑪士似乎是與復占派一鼻孔出氣的。但因他趁便也介紹了「日出之前」的情飾，所以也節譯在下面：　　「大家一致承認德國自然主主的重要代表是堆普特曼，他是新信條的辯論者。不過他的辯論不大完善。他沒有抽象的教訓．也沒有藝術的手腕，以有病理的診斷。例如他的第一種戲劇「日出之前」。一個獸性而又錯憤的濃夫在他的田地裏發現煤礦，突然變成巨富。他續娶了後妻，她是一個粗鄙的淫　，與他人奸通。前妻留下的兩個女兒，一個是結過婚的女人，也是一個酒鬼。另一個女兒卻他愉快的女孩，到學校裏去學習了許多謙遜和文雅，在知道了環境的惡劣以後，卻沒有方法可想。一位年輕的社會主義的青年到這兒來考察媒碳的工作情形。他愛上了海倫，與她訂婚，她幾乎歡喜得發狂。不料他在一們醫生娜兒知道了這家庭是不健全的。恐怕他自也娶了海倫以後，污點會留給下一代，他便像懦夫一樣地逃走了；海倫因受刺激而自殺。霍普特曼把這些事寫得活生生的。農夫是府敗分子，鏡子殘酷地高高舉起，對着自然。這實是粗鄙的寫實，使得別人讀了以後，除了覺得生動以外，便只能得到粗鄙的印像，好像讀新聞裹的壞故事一樣。這裏沒有悲劇的力數，對於藝術沒有一點影饗。彷彿做了三小時的人身診斷。絲毫也不能引人願意再讀它一兩遍。　　「在為兒我們就看到德國自然至義的弱點。即使最勇敢的戰士，無論在氣質上或社會偏向上甚至個人限制上，他們所看到的人生都只始醜惡面的人生，殊不知健康與廉遜，德行與崇高情諸，也同樣地是自然，不一定要腐蝕與罪行纔算是自然。有幾種較近的堆普特曼的戲劇較之「日出之前」幹斷部分校少，但總之他所給我們的，還是忠實於自然主義，專寫讖慘的畫面，例如社會的罪感，家庭的衝突，個人的衰弱籌等。續者這然故事看多了，胃口會倒掉，而要想念到過去的傑你的。頭半年，他們覺得新奇，也許要喝采。但後來他們不能在這離發現一點點愉快，敎訓，或是情緒的上昇；於是他們躲避了它，另外尋找別的水久的需要。作家們願意利用戲劇和小說的形式給人們藥吃，不是一件壞事，困難的是人們發現這藥是什麼以後，每每不肯去吃。　　「不過霍普特曼並不曾永遼照着這條自然主義的缐走。一八九六年他的「沉鐘」使得觀衆驚詫。這是自然主義與浪漫的象徽主義的結合，沉鐘寫鑄鐘人拋棄了妻兒，破壞了教區的道德，受了妖女的魔術誘惑，要想潯求不可能的成功和愚　的夢。這成為他的傑作。在沉鏡裏有詩，浪漫的魅力，不受拘束的想際，雖然象　主義在當時受了一點小挫折。」　　世界上多的是醜惡的事，叫我們怎麼能夠閉着眼睛不去看它不去寫它呢？湯瑪士的話賞是一種偏見。湯瑪士大約是屬於浪漫一方面的。知巴知彼，終於我還是把他的意見譯下來了。阿·翠　（小說）下  中原　　她說話時帶這三分悲哀，七分氣憤。一提到她的丈夫孩子，他立刻氣憤了：　　「小姐呀，你眞不看見我們同村那些姑娘，借清避東洋鬼，上海蘇州各處去跑。有的去做廠，有的去帶傭，一年半載回來，個個都是金戒指，紡綢衫，有的燙了鬈頭髮，比你小姐都時髦幾倍！只有我，被那殺千刀的寃家管住了，還有那個小債鬼，害得我……」　　「　，眞的！你的孩子呢？」我想起了阿翠二年前的大肚子，插上去問。　　「別提起那小債鬼！早知她要死，我眞犯不着守在家裏替那殺千刀做死活的做！現在好了！……」她似乎嫌吃力，把乎裹的包裏擱上桌子。包裹大得很，半個桌面全給估住！我用手指撥撥包袱的角縫，一件花呢舊棉襖的領子露了出來。正是暖和的李天，棉襖至少是八九個月後需用的束西。我便間她：「阿翠，你這次山來後不預備回去了嗎？」　　「死也不回去的了！……」她的頭一拗，眼睛還是亮光光。不過那亮光與二年前有些不同，這是一種態憤堅決的亮光。她說：「小姐，我已看穿了……看穿了，什麼男人……什麼恩情，…都是假的，都是靠不住的！只有自已一　手才靠得住！我們村裹那些姑娘，一個個金戒指，紡綢衫，……不全是靠自己的一雙手！我是看穿了……再守在家裏替那殺千刀看豬餵牛，一世裏沒有出頭的了！」　　這天阿翠僅在我們地方躭撋一小時。一會兒有個書眉搽粉的申年女人米找她，阿翠介紹說她她們同村的四根嫂，在上海帶過四年傭，現在城裹一份大戶人家當細做。最近四根嫂替阿翠存了份人家，約着今天去上工。　　阿翠提了包裹高高興興上工去了。隔了牛個月，一個臉孔方方正正的鄉下小夥子和阿翠的娘　　「阿翠，你二年多不上城，這些日子裹好嗎？」我問她。　　「好？好得幾乎到閻，王那裹去！……」，滿頭大汗尋到我們地方，但我們也不詳細阿翠在什麼人家，叫他們去問西根嫂。　　以後好像隔了一大段日子，沒有阿翠的消息，她有沒有被丈夫尋回去，我們也不知道。差不多隔了八九個月吧，有一天她忽然又來了。　　那次第一眼看見她，我就記起她說的「只有自己的一變雙才靠得住」。果然她的一雙手真靠得住，簇新陰丹士林布罩衫裹的黑底白花人造縐夾襖，做得長了些，露出牛寸長的一段，大　鈕上掛着白蘭花，黑洋綢褲子齊腳背，腳管有一尺大，玉巳絲　，藏青皮底緞鞋。不過最觸目的，卻是二條郵在耳旁烏光亮亮的小辨子！　　「只有自己的一燮手靠得住」，那雙手上已帶起了金戒指。阿翠的眼界廣闊了，她告訴我他們的太太像阿屈死。式樣過時的夾大衣，還洋不洋腔不腔的穿在身上；又說大姨太的新鑛壞是假貨；二姨太的香水不是巴黎貨，味道難聞。……　　不過阿翠提起得最多的，是他們的老爺，——老爺年紀只有三十多，老爺做着官，老爺有點兒放蕩，老爺歡喜年輕女傭人，老爺眞討壓，老爺常和她……　　阿翠張開塗滿唇膏的嘴巴微徽的笑。我記不得向她說了一句什麼話，好像叫她快換份規矩的人家做做吧。她伸出戴着金戒指的手，把我拍了拍，說：　　「小姐，我是看穿了！什麼規矩不規矩，全是騙騙人的！天下世界，只有銅錢銀子最實惠！有了銅鈿，才能穿得好，吃得好，過寫意日腳！什麼規矩不規矩，全是空的，我是看穿了……看穿了！」　　也許為了我沒有熱心贊和她的話，那次阿翠一去竟二三年沒有來。不過這二三年中！略有些沸沸揚揚的消息傳來，什麼阿翠做了她東家的第三個小老婆，……阿翠跟東家搬往別處，阿翠的東家死了，……阿翠另外姘了許多人。……　　常然沸沸場揚的消息不一定可靠，我們不敢完全相信，聽過也就忘記了。今年三月裏，東門外朱天菩薩大出會，小弟硬要我陪他去看會。到了那裹，　鼓喧天，人像潮水湧上　下。好容易擠進人叢，小弟被人踏了一腳，痛得直哭，不得已重新拉着他擠出來，想找個店家去坐坐，卻被後面一陣「小組小姐」喊住了。　　回頭向一個滿奇爛療的年輕乞婆看了又看，我猛然一驚，竟是一張熟悉的瓜子臉，她就是阿翠！　　「阿翠！怎麼你弄到這樣；子？……你不是很寫意嗎？」我驚訝地問。……　　「小姐，不瞞你說，我回來好久了，一直不敢進城見你們，……我給那些死胚染上了毒……醫不好，這二天更厲害，鼻子越爛越深，又二天沒有東西吃，餓得眞難過。——」　　我把袋裹所有的六七張單鈔丟給她時，很想問問她：「阿翠，你現在又看穿什麼了嗎？」但見她鼻孔裏一串污膿洗出來，我一陣噁心，沒有問，拉了小弟就走了。難忘的一夜  楊維特　　去年，七月的榴花，開遍南印度原野的時候，在一個久爾初晴的清晨，我突然接到了友人在布朗加鎮病重的來信，當天便搭上火車離開加城，到沙地亞時，已是傍晚了。　　本站上許多黑炭似的孩子們，張着嚼過檳榔的紅嘴唇，大聲向我們兜售零食，漆着顏色的鐵皮房子，在夕陽餘揮下閃着亮光，這時遠處，傳來了教堂隱約的鐘聲！　　我在一家同鄕開的咖啡店樓上，找到了健，他興常高興地對我說：　　「你來得眞巧，印度姑娘等會兒要在對面林子裹的草坪上，跳草裙舞呢！」　　但我告訴池：友人正在病中，今晚要趕到離此卅哩的布期加去，傑體了也不便挽留，便引我走人後園，加滿了吉普車的油箱，他　着我的手可囑着說：　　「剎軍不靈，轉彎和下坡時要小心呵！」我就與他匆匆地別　　迷茫的夜色中，我獨自駕駛着車子，在平坦的柏油路上疾馳，不一刻，我卻遠遠看到前面：有一位關着華格子紗　的女郎，向我頻頻揮手，在小橋邊我把車停住，她那深黑的　子，似乎在閃着淚光，十分焦急地向我說：　　「加利期格利逹，卡門？」（聲我到前而去，好嗎？）我想到夜行者的孤獨，自然答應了。　　後來，她天眞地絮絮告訴我：家裹的情形，與今天晚歸的原因，她說每天幫媽到果園去剷草，捉虫，還要給小狗沖兩次涼，她名叫卡莎，弟弟里達是頂頑皮的，媽常打他，他便一溜煙爬上高高的椰樹上去，風聲中她未免說得太快了．我父一心有恰記着病友，有許多我現在覺得非常可愛的話，我那時可惜沒有完全聽清楚。　　剛過五哩的路標，路旁忽然閃來一個高大的南美黑人，擋住了車子，他粗嘗地跳上來，醉醺醺地不斷說着莫名其妙的話，我們又這樣走了三哩，卡莎告訴我

<p>自己談偏愛  少夫　　書人就有「謝公最小偏憐女」的詩句，可見得人們難免偏心。父母之於子女、師長之於學生，甚至丈夫之於妻妾或外室，如果感情可以拿天秤來衡量，則其間的多少當可立見。　　我曾知道一家人家，寡母住在大兒子家，吃的穿的用的化的全由大兒子供給，老母從不說大兒子二句話好；可是那個頑劣成性的小兒子偶來採視老母，懷來兩校桃子，老母可就到處宣揚這小兒子的如何孝順。據友人批評，該是老年人老欄塗了，其所以要大兒子供養她，就因為心中偏愛幼兒，惟恐幼兒多用錢的原故，倒並不是不願幼兒當家，至於兒子之成器與否，則非所評也。　　政黨對於祖國，其責任，猶之兒子之於老親。我們做國家主人的老百姓，再不能學老人那樣湖塗，對於獨力支撐門庭的大兒子苛責，而對於頑劣性的幼兒反而偏家任其作為了。精神病  桂庭　　漫談神經衰弱　　所謂神經衰弱實在並非腦筋或神經的破壞或者變質，而是神經系統不足個的可者一部分的作用發生障礙的病態，是由於刺激和疲勞而引起的一種異常的精神狀態。顧名思義，我們通常總以為神經衰弱一定是因為手足或者腦筋的神經變成衰北的緣故，然而實際上並不是這樣。這種病悲的形成完全是由於通訊社制各種神經的精神方面發生畸形的變化所致，因此神經衰弱是應該歸入精神病的節團的。　　有些神經衰弱癥是先天性的，在體質方面，精神方面，一生下來對於刺激和疲勞便覺得異常敏感。所以，無論它的形態和程度處樣的不同，它的徵候在該提的時期衰早就表現出來。因為神經衰弱是和歇私的里亞（婦女的夏　病），或神經質具有共同之制的一種病癥，所以這種病癥有許多是由這傳血統帶來的。這些容易引起特殊精神變態的人假使受着外界的刺激或者身心過勞，精神亢奮，則神經衰弱的癥狀更立即表現出來，當然，就是身體健康的人罷，假使繼續着精神上的打擊，身心過勞，和精神亢奮，後來也會患着神經衰弱的。　　神經衰弱無疑是一種文明病。文化愈進步，人類受刺激愈多。這些刺激固然由於貧冨之別，敎育各度的高低，或都市與農村生活的不同有着深淺的差別。但是總而言之，在容易受着刺激的環境下，是最易獲得神經衰弱的病癥的。至於生理方面，由於先天的這傳關係，腸胃病，心臟病，特別是性荷爾蒙分泌的變態，或者「更年期」的精神異常等原因也會為了生理上的變化而引起神經衰弱的病狀的。神經衰弱的人大都是生而具有特殊體質者，所以一受到體內的各臟器的疾患的刺激，就自然很容易獲得本癥。　　疑神疑鬼　　神經衰弱的癥狀大致可以分為精神及肉體兩方面。在精神方面，鞏怖　的關念是特強烈，譬如對於疾病的恐布，時時刻刻總懷疑着自己是否梁到了肺病，於是夏心忡忡，寢夕不安，和人家談話的時候，恰巧對方偶然咳嗽了一聲，他便疑心這個人是否患着肺結核的，他咳出來的人的臉色不佳，恐怕一定是陳梁到肺病滬，一樣一樣的想下去，把自己弄得神色倉皇，筋疲力倦為止。有些人恐怕自己患到心臟病或者狹心病，而有些人恐怕生胃癌或梅毒入腦的病癥。他們於是乎把種種偶然的事實與這些病癥聯緊起來，更奇怪的是有些神經衰弱患才對唹　各種車輛會發生特殊恐怖的心量。他們一見到汽車，電車或者，就是自禁的害怕起來。有些患者則對於親友的狀況及將來表示過分的關切，以致胡思亂想，妾加揣測，結果庸人自擾，自驚驚人。其他恐怖的對求很多，如食物，火災，地譬，以及無論什么事情都可能成為恐佈的對象。神經衰弱的病人日常的心懷變幻測，有時異常悲觀，有時暴躁如香，而有時則感覍非常夏　。所以，他絕對不會專想着一件事。在他的腦筋裏，總是雜念紛紜，若思不得要領，結果弄到自己無限疲勞，頭痛，並且情緒其懇劣。　　在肉義方面，神經衰心虛的普通癥徽是觀是最大而最著的癥狀。其忍的便是：一受些微的刺激，則裏覺精神亢奮，需而頭痛胘暈，身體易感疲倦，詩作欠俾神之狀。動使是在興高采烈火的時候，一會兒使會愁圖不展，如有隱　對於任何事物，都覺得了無生趣，臉色時而硃赤，時而蒼白。簽易出汗，手足冰冷。有時無端驚悸，　捕頓速。手指不自禁的顫動；在嚴重的塲合，連臉部的肌肉也會發抖起來。背脊和兩足時當感覺疼痛和麻痺。這些癥狀是患着胃下垂或神經性胃疾的病人居多。最普通的後果便是便秘和下痢。同時，是貪慾不振，緒神疲備。頭部和膝肘都會呈着極敏感的反應。如果是年紀老大的人，平時並無神經衰弱的癥候，而突羅此疾者，則其主要的原因必然是由於內分泌的反常或者是動脈的硬化。其病態則此較年青的患者更為嚴重進一步則徹夜難眠，食慾不振，恐怖癥亦隨之而起，肌肉逐漸衰弱，假使不好好地加以療治，則最後可能陷於全身衰弱以至不救。　　在檢驗神經衰弱的病癥時，我們必須同時精查該病者是否患着其他疾病，特別是進行性麻痺，甲狀腺大，慢性腎臟疾患，糖尿病，胃腸病，尤其是胃炎，十二指腸潰痬同，膽石，以及腹膜是否正常。　　音樂感化　　在精神方面，我們必須設法使病者對於其恐怖的對獲得正當的理解，並且證明他無需恐怖的理由。恐怖的原因一去，則其病亦大半已愈。所以在必要的塲合，施用催眠術也是療治神經衰弱的方法之一。有時，宗敎的安慰和音樂的感化，對於鎮表病者的神經方面均能發揮不到地效用。　　至於病才的日常生活，則務須靜養，嚴守規律，有條不紊，尤其是充分的眠睡和進食依時。富於刺激性的食物飲料如烟酒等均須一律戒除。衰弱的病人更須注意滋補品的營養。如鐵，憐，砒素等強壯劑亦須斟酌服用。身體並不十分衰弱的病者最好能夠素食，並且多吃水果，牛肉，茶及咖啡均須予限制。至於室內運動，散步，冷水摩療，據郵及溫泉療法皆可適用。　　至於失眠方面則須病者一方面設法增進身心條養，袪除　念；另方面，須由醫師處方服用安眠藥。可是，安眠樂的種類須時常調換，以免養成習慣於革一種藥品的幣病。心悸亢進，遺精，夢遺，或過度興奮則須施用鎮靜劑如三涙片，渙化鈣等。神經衰弱的其他最普遍的癥候便是胃腸障礙，食慾不振。精神一刺激，則消化機能承蒙之發生障礙，而胃痛，咳氣，腸嗚，氣醫，呼吸困難，肩痛等現徵亦接踵而至。此時百病　生，精神疲敝。所以，要治療這些紛來沓至的病癥，更需要絕對堅持強的意志和遵過主治醫師的指導，才能有效。　　最近，荷爾蒙學理的研究日新月異。根據許多權威學者的發現，人體裏荷爾蒙的缺乏亦是神經衰弱的主要原因之一。臨床試騐的結果證明荷爾蒙，尤其是上腦下垂體前葉荷爾蒙，的補允對於神經衰弱的病癥殊有治療的價值，可是，荷爾蒙的吸收是以注射為最有效。當然，同時進服荷爾蒙劑是更為相得益彰的。上帝的禮物　夢與下意識　　我謳歌着夢的偉大，因為夢是上帝給予八類的最偉大的禮品。在夢裏，我們所有的慾望和幻想都能夠一一實現了。雖然滿足的時間祗是一剎那，而夢醒之後還是一塲空虛，但是，假使人生沒有夢的話，那不是更失望，更苦悶嗎？　　一個人的慾望是無窮盡的。所以，我們的成語也是「慾壑難塡」，「做了皇帝想昇仙」的話，在現實的環境裏，慾望的滿足是受着許多限制的。法律與道德便是最主要的限制。譬如，人家既富且貴，生活舒適，而自己恰恰相反，家窮屋陋，苦不堪言，同時環境　方面又無立即致富的可能。如果沒有道德和法律的限制，這個人便可以去搶，去偷，或者去騙，以滿足其致富的慾望。可是現實上是不可能的，於是祇好把這些慾望拼命壓抑到下意識去。然後，「日有所思，夜有所夢」，那些慾望便在夢到了滿足，有時夢見發了大財，有時夢見天降黃金，諸如此類。我們就是這樣的通過了夢而滿足我們不可能實現的慾望。　　因此，夢是上意識作用的一種結果。一個人在肯德基眠中意識朦朧之時，依身體內外的種種刺激，而喚起其意識，其時應於其人心境的狀況，而與其所有的觀念，互相聯合，現快樂或悲傷及驚懷的種種幻想，那就是夢。這種下意識的作用是完全自動的而非本人所能予以控制，所以，夢中所表現的幻想和經過如果加以分析，便能發現本人下意識裏所陷蔽的慾望和苦悶，從而糾正其心理的變態或者測騐其犯罪的動機。有趣的例子  人龍　　有一個實例是非常有趣的。該例的病者，精神非萎頓。平日總是沉默寡言，並　且時常經絕與任何接觸。最奇怪的是一見平行綫的圖，他便覺得倉　失措，甚至於陷於神智錯迷的狀態。後來經過心理治療專家詳細的研究一番，才發現他時常發夢。夢裏總是下雪，病者在雪上溜冰，一直溜到一個斜坡裏，一齊跌落於萬仞的深崖下。每次夢到這裏。他就一驚而醒。由於這個奇特的夢進而追溯他的幼年生活。原業，他在孩提的時候曾以滑板為戲。有一次不小心撞到坐在滑板下面的另一個孩童，結果這個孩童跌到鐵柵上，被銳利的鐵柵刺穿胸部而死，當時驚恐過度，　　得非常深刻的印象。後來長大成人，下意識方面一直總覺得自己曾經犯過殺人之罪，心理分析學上即所謂犯罪感，（Guilty　Conplex），於是，他的心理變態在兩方面表現出來：一個現象是見着平行綫的圖案，就發生極端恐慌的感覺，因而平行綫便是象微他幼時遊戲的滑板，由此而勇起他的犯罪大吃一驚　的　想，而另一個現象是時常做着滑雪的惡夢，最後以過長時做着滑雪的亞夢。最後發過長時期的解釋和關治終於恢復心理的健康。　　夢與下意識是研究近代近為心理學的新領域。着通的夢和下意識偶然的表現，固然是人類苦悶生活的輕鬆的解脫，但在嚴重的塲合，卻是解決心理慶態和犯罪心理的一把重要錀匙。我希望我國的醫學，犯罪學，心理學各界能夠急起直追，發掘這個方興未艾的新科學的園地！心理測驗  佑英　　世界上最難使人見到的東西，莫過於理心，因為它很空洞抽象，飄泊不定，難以捉摸。因此，要想知適人的心理。必須經過無形中的試探與測騐　　英國文學家沙士比重說：「測騐人的心理非常簡畢，只要用一個十分的硬幣（可用我國戰前之十分錢的總幣）給所要測騐的人們看，並且，事先得要聲明法幣上面有一個極小空洞可以由北面看穿正面，那麼再用鼓勵與勉勵來激動被測騐者，然後每人發一張紙叫他們塡寫解答洞的位置及是否年者見就可以得到一個結論」。　　我記得，曾經在成都的軍校裏，有一位年青的隊長，他要想知道全隊每一個學生的誠實與虛僞，就很　航地根據了沙士比亞的方法去做了。他集合全隊學生調話謂：「軍人最重要的條件是身體，而身體道先的條件是腿眼要好。否則的話根本談不上打仗，眼睛特別好的人，可以當狙擊手。狙擊手在軍隊裏是最光勞的，作戰時專門射擊敵人的指揮官與重要目標，要挑選四名。如果選中了的人，比其他的學生要舒服一點，可以不出操不上課每天除了射擊外很自由。現在我要拿一件東西來測騐大家的眼睛，作為挑選的決定」。學生們聽了以後，都發生了一種奇異之感，於是乎大家都想當狙擊手。　　在這種心理狀態下他開始用以上的方法來測騐，每一個學生發一張紙，在紙上要畫一張總理的橡（與法幣總理像大小相同）如看得見洞即用記號寫明在什么位置。看得不清楚的就寫不清楚完全看不到的就寫看不見。對號果他得一得了一個正確的答覆寫看不見的人是很誠實與坦白，寫看不清楚的是不十分忠實的中庸之道者，寫洞在什麼位置的人是最虛僞。（註：法幣上沒有小洞）美國復員軍人心理變態  徐勞譯自新聞週刋　　第二次世界大戰告終後，美國復員的軍人裏發生了許多心理變態的病癥。一般心理治療所的組織和設備實在過於簡陋，殊不足以應付那些病人的需要。後來心理變態的復員軍人逐漸增加到五十萬名的時候，復員軍人管理局認為事態嚴重，不得不設法予以補救，於是籌劃組織一個心理健康治療所，目的在於治療復員軍人心理變態初期的病癥。這樣做法可以減少嚴重神經病的患者的數目，否則那些病人可能就成永遠神經錯亂，以致不能復原。　　那些治療所是設立於人中稠密的地方；在那裏，復員軍人可以自動或者由於雇用和救　濟機關的指導而獲得迅速的治療。一共有三十三所，有些設立於私人的醫院裏，有些設立於復員包括三組：主持人是一具心理治療家，一個心理學家是專門襄助試騐和診斷的，而另外一個是社會心理調查員，專門　集關於病人家庭情形的重要統計。　　去年冬天，首批的治療所開始工作。最近一共有十四所在那裏報務。其他治療所之所遲未能開始工作的主要原因是：經過嚴格訓練的心理治療專有的異常缺乏，在全美國祗有三千五百名。因此，復員軍人管理當局另外籌劃雇用其中一千名專家來主辦研究院，俾本年年終之前能夠訓練更多熟練的人手以資調用。　　紐約市治療所是全國最大規模的一間了。每日治職一百七十五名病人，從輕微的心理變態到神經錯亂都有，所長白朝博士宣稱：「有些病人的情況是嚴重到必須送院療治的，但是他們的數目祗是總數百分一而已。我們的目的是在於幫助那些復員軍人能夠替社會服務而不致衣需要送他們到醫院裏去療治。」　　GI心理能變的原因：那些復員軍人對於用戰的經騐表示不滿而至於心理變態者佔極少數。根據復員軍人管理當局的分析，歸納起來，原因如下：（一）作戰時離鄕北井，情緒惡劣；（二）對於軍事紀律的管束表示壓惡並且不能適應於嚴格的軍人生活；（三）性的犯罪。　　多數病人是二十多歲左右這年紡是最容易發生神經病的。稪員軍人患神經病者之中，婦女的數止比男人多。大約一部分的原因是：全國婦女患神經病的比率比男人高的綠故。辦些醫師根據臨床的經騐指出：許多婦女是由於心理的刺激而從軍的：（一）他們希望離開家庭，（二）他們需要男性的安慰；（三）他們希望能夠和男人並駕齊驅。　　心理治療所最近為了男婦病人遭遇害　苦的情感問題，而不是能解決的精神病，曾經施用最新式的精神治療術。　　人生便是一塲戲：最精采的治療法是叫做心理紅劇治療法，是莫蘭諾博士所設計的。過去五年間在華盛頓的聖伊里沙伯醫院實騐而獲得特殊的成功。那個患着情緒失常的病人經醫師的指導寫成，篇簡音的生活史。然後編成遽本，在患神經病的復員傷害罪人的觀衆面前，由那個病人自己和其他自願參加做戲的病人一起在戲臺上表演一幕描寫他過去生活過程的戲劇。　　當心理治療專家以為演到病人過去生活過程某一階段是他一生的轉捩點時，他可以立刻停止臺上表演，然後對那病人解釋，指出那便是他籌成大錯之處。他於是提出另一個劇本，　比提示那事件應該如何解決的辦法。有時也詢問觀衆，徵救分階段產的意見來幫助病人發現他自己的一切所為。因為那些觀衆也是處於局樣環境的人，所以病者總不會陷於自覺的窘境　。他於是興高采烈火地解決了自己的問題，而結果非常美滿　　心進治療專家也曾施用「環境的試騐」來訓練病人如何應付復員的環境。這是戰時施用的一種技術來選譯服務戰略法動部門的幹部。主時試騐的當局擬序曲某種壞境　使應選者裝做一個間謀，看他如何應付，例如，他準備如何應付一個頑強的納粹衡鋒隊隊員的「疲勞　問」。但是現在呢，復員軍人管理當局卻指導病者如何應付和平時的環境，如怎樣求職或怎樣要求加薪等。心理治療專家，於是研究他的情緒如何反應藉以估計他應付人生過程中所必須經過的環境，然後給他種種指導，以解決他的困難和痛苦。連載寄給亡婦鳳君（十）  周瘦鵑　　廿九年來，你的心常掛在我和孩子們的身上，寒暖·飷飽·時時關切，所以我們終年不大會害病，在全家開支的賬目中，醫藥費占到最小的一項。你忘了自己的安樂，而以我和孩子們的安樂為安樂，你的心坎中，是從沒有「自私」兩個字的。記得民二十年間我們　遷到了蘇州不久的某一夜，我正在上海服務申報，被榆兒溜進了我的書房，偷去了十景樹中全部的骨　小玩意，事後檢點卻見　　中我所秘藏着的伊人的善多信札照片以及銀筆銀水盂等信物，沒有偷去，你懷着戒心，就一起收拾好了，另外安放；因為你知道我一向把這些東西認　無價之寶的，不但不加毀傷，反替我一一保管着，等我回家來時，忙不迭的拿出來交給我，直使我感動得流涙，普天下一般　娘子，都該愧死！而我之敬你愛你收服了。　　自從你卅三歲以後，我見你育兒太幸苦了，就從事事節育，不敢再給你生孩子；孩子們一個個長大起不，你也比較的安閒了一些，所以我常能同你出去看電影，吃吃小館子；那時朋友們都愛跳舞，同逛舞塲，你也居然學會了步子，伴着我跳；春秋兩季，我和朋友們總得出門遊山玩水，好在家中有母親和菜媽她們可以主持家政，因此我着你同去，你怕母親說話，總是強而後可。在我的回憶中，要算超山·莫干山·普陀山·雪寶山·宜興善權洞張公洞·西湖九溪十八潤等幾處遊踪·在我們的生命史中是最最甜蜜的。那時生活安定，心境愉快，我和你確曾亨過一些清福；尤其是從民十九年秋移家蘇州以後直到民廿五年冬這一個時期，一同在萬花如海中度着生活，優戲游哉，無憂無慮，可算是我們的黃金時代，如今雖已依舊　到了故園，無奈景物如故，而人事已非，真的是不堪回手話當年了！　　我家第一次厄運，是開始於民二十六年三月十七日，即農曆二月初五日，我們十六歲的次子格，因在園子裏踏自由車，掉在池子裹淹死了。這天早上，我恰往上海申報館去發稿，午後忽覺心　不安起來，忽怱搭車返蘇，趕到床裏卻見你正在門口號啤大哭，在等我回來，雖請了李光動醫師和溥習醫院，師等急救，終於不洽身死。這打擊太子了，使我們心身上蒙了莫大的創傷，尤其是愛子心切的你，簡直是無可慰藉，無可譬解的。入夏就在籃　山下的　谷公墓中買了幾個墓穴，把遵可憐的孩子安葬好了。這一年的秋季八月十三日，中日大戰爆發，三日後敵機就來轟炸蘇州，為了老母幼子愛不起驚嚇，便扶老携幼的隨同柬吳諸敎授避居浙屬南潯鎮，後因敵軍在金山術登陸，南潯也受了敵機的威脅，於是又遠迢迢的避到了安徵夥縣的南　村去。我們身居異鄕，還是忘不了亡兒；到得蘇州淪陷以後，你又愛虛到亡兒三尺　墳可要遭刼？那時我曾有過這麼兩首詩：「吾兒倖免玄黃劫，枕藉醫理　　好自誤；客裏如何難入夢？水程山釋兩模　」「花草吳宮付刼灰，藝無烽大　　　；　兒高　　　下　，　　　　　母來。」　　我們在南屏村住了下來，一家極　洩洩，仍亨天倫之樂；平日閒居無事，我們總帶着兒女們到前山大松林中去檢拾松毛松果和芳草，帶回作燃料；我曾以一詩一詞記之詩云：「未經憂患貪安樂，坐食奚知稼穡艱；且與兒曹同習苦，夕陽影裏負新遠。」詞去：「雪幹當桱鳳，雲根自　較，腦拏夭矯上層霄。大　風來　　，萬　　起洪濤。丹果如丹荔，　針似翠毛。檢來並作一　挑。好去煎茶，和去當香燒。好去鴨爐添火，玉翠陵芳　。」（調寄喝火令）那時我們雖做了回不得家鄕的難民，而我們一家的生活還是比較安定的。你平日仍是照樣的操勞，忙忙碌碌的不以為苦；到了農層年弱，你還照樣的預備年糕年　，照樣的祭祀祖先，大除夕又照樣的請我們吃團圓夜飯，你忙雖忙卻是高興得很。我們請老母朝南坐了首位，我和你分坐兩邊，孩子們依次坐着，在紅　燒之下，邊吃邊談笑，渾忘了流離之苦；當時我也曾記之以詩：「七　四盤一　鍋，家鄕風味未增多；客中猶吃團圓飯，鞠得閩人　笑　。」</p>

<h3>Yu and Zhou Visited Marshal Ma Again Yesterday: Peace Talks Continue; US Ambassador to Proceed to Kuling Today to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Marshal Ma's contact with representatives from both the government and the Communist Party has become more frequent in the past two days. Government figures remain calm, while Communist Party's Zhou Enlai declared: "Today has reached the most critical stage." Yu Dawei visited Marshal Ma in the morning yesterday, holding talks for about three hours. That night at 9 pm, he again visited Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, talking until about 11 pm before returning. This morning at 9:30 am, Yu Dawei visited Marshal Ma again, talking for an hour. When Yu exited, reporters happened to be at Marshal Ma's residence and inquired about the content of the talks. Yu said: "Wait a few minutes, there will be important news soon, there are others coming." Ten minutes later, Zhou Enlai indeed arrived by car. Zhou's meeting with Marshall lasted until 12:30 pm. Zhou Enlai also visited Ambassador Stuart. It is understood that the content of Zhou's visit to Marshall concerned the war situation and the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. Zhou and Ambassador Stuart also focused on this in their talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Ambassador Stuart informed our reporter at 9:40 pm tonight that he had decided to fly to Lushan by US military plane from Dajiaochang Airport at noon tomorrow. Embassy Counselor Smith and Baitaowa will accompany him. The ambassador also informed the reporter that he planned to return to Nanjing immediately after presenting his credentials to Chairman Chiang the day after tomorrow, because there were many embassy affairs here that needed to be dealt with. However, if Chairman Chiang insisted on him staying, he might stay for a while to tour this famous scenic spot. He also said that Marshal Ma will continue to perform his duties as usual and will go to Lushan in a few days.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart stayed at the embassy all day today, spending most of his time dealing with embassy affairs and receiving friends and reporters. At about 7 pm, he hosted a dinner for Hachison, the head of the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group, as well as Wu Wenzao, Xie Bingxin, Wu Yifang, Wu Qiyu and his wife. After the meal, they continued to talk until 9:30 pm before Hachison and the others left.</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 17th] Ambassador Stuart told our reporter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received a telegram from Chairman Chiang regarding the presentation of credentials, which was scheduled to be held in Lushan the day after tomorrow. It is understood that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared everything, the credentials have also been translated, and Director Li Jun and Section Chief Wang Jizheng will be sent to accompany Ambassador Stuart to fly to Lushan with various documents.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Kuling Correspondent, 17th] Various signs here have confirmed that the newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Stuart Leiden, will arrive here from Beijing at 3 pm tomorrow, becoming the second distinguished guest since Chairman Chiang stationed in Kuling. The first distinguished guest was General Wyatt, the representative of the British Prime Minister, who arrived this morning. The auditorium of the Youth Summer Camp in the Chuanxixueshe is currently being arranged for Ambassador Stuart to present his credentials. It is heard that the envoys of Italy, Norway, and Afghanistan are also coming here, and the famous Xianyan Hotel on the mountain has been reserved for their accommodation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] It is learned that the government recently ordered six "C54" type aircraft from the United States. The form of this type of aircraft is slightly different from Marshal Marshall's special "C54" type, and can land at Jiujiang Airport. Therefore, the government has designated one of these six aircraft specifically for Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart to fly between Nanjing and Kuling.</p>

<h3>Draft Sino-American Commercial Treaty Being Negotiated by Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The draft Sino-American commercial treaty is being negotiated by both sides and will soon be submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Executive Yuan for deliberation.

Not only will it be related to mutually beneficial trade between the two countries in the future, but other countries' commercial treaties with China will also inevitably use this as a blueprint.</p>

<p>(Question) The Communist Party has strongly criticized the government for the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo in Kunming. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The government attaches great importance to this case. Who committed this matter, I am unwilling to speculate out of thin air. Before the case is investigated, any arbitrary guesses on any side are unfair. The President of the Executive Yuan has issued a circular to all provincial and municipal governments to provide special protection to people of political parties in various places. Director Tang Zong of the Police Department has been dispatched to Kunming to supervise the thorough investigation and find out the truth in a short period of time. The government considers the occurrence of such events to be the greatest regret, and will certainly investigate it strictly. No matter who did it, it will be severely punished without leniency after it is found out.</p>
<p>(Question) Is it true that Pan Guangdan and other eight members of the Kunming Democratic League have requested protection from the US Consulate?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: I have also received reports. The Executive Yuan has telegraphed the Kunming Garrison Commander to provide special police protection to the relevant personnel and provide them with other protections that they hope for, while not hindering their freedom of movement.</p>
<p>(Question) It is generally believed that the Chairman's trip to Kuling means the end of peace talks, at least for the time being. Could you please explain this situation? If the negotiations continue, how will they proceed? Minister Peng replied: Peace negotiations are still continuing. In this era of telecommunications and aviation, the short distance between Nanjing and Kuling does not constitute an obstacle to negotiations.</p>
<p>(Question) Where is Pu Yi now? When and where will he be handed over to the Chinese government?</p>
<p>Vice Minister Liu replied: Pu Yi has not yet entered the country. Negotiations on the handover are still in progress. In addition, if you want to know anything else: Foreign Minister Wang is determined to go to Paris to participate in the peace conference in the near future.</p>
<p>(Question) Will the main parts of the government move to Kuling? How long will Chairman Chiang be stationed in Kuling? Minister Peng replied: The government remains in Nanjing. Meetings of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan are still held in Nanjing. The Chairman's stay in Kuling is undetermined.</p>

<h3>A Night Visit to John Leighton Stuart</h3>
<p>— Our Beijing Correspondent, Pu Dejie</p>
<p>In April of this year, General Marshall returned to the United States to report to President Truman. It is said that on the first morning, after his meeting with President Truman, the President summoned Dr. John Leighton Stuart in the afternoon. No one knows what they discussed, but one thing, "street news," began to spread. It spread throughout the United States and to China, saying that General Marshall's months of work in China were not enough to compensate for his hard work, that he was tired, tired, and that Dr. Stuart would replace him. Not many days later, General Marshall returned to China, traveling from Chongqing to Nanjing, still tirelessly working for this troubled friendly nation. Dr. Stuart also quietly returned to Beiping, focusing on taking care of the reopening of Yenching University. However, this did not make people—especially particularly perceptive reporters—fully believe that Dr. Stuart was not involved in negotiations between the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, because when he was in Nanjing, he often went in and out of General Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road.</p>
<p>Today (the 15th) at noon, Ambassador Stuart flew from Beiping to Nanjing again. This was undoubtedly the person and event that Nanjing reporters paid the most attention to, so everyone started playing hide-and-seek, trying their best to visit this old friend of China, the new ambassador. The reporter arrived at the American Embassy on Shanghai Road at 7:20 PM, but because the new ambassador was out on official business, they did not meet. It was not until 9:30 PM that the reporter returned to Shanghai Road, but the ambassador had not yet returned. They had no choice but to go to Ninghai Road. Sure enough, the new ambassador was watching a movie with General Marshall. So the reporter decided to wait, this opportunity could not be missed. At the same time, from the ambassador's driver, they learned that after leaving the embassy at 6:30 PM, the ambassador first went to No. 6 Yihe Road to see Advisor Chuan, who had a cold, staying for about a quarter of an hour, and then went to Ninghai Road to have dinner with General Marshall. Afterwards, they watched a movie together.</p>
<p>"The movie just ended!" It was 10:05 PM.</p>
<p>Sitting in the "Jeep," waiting, waiting, waiting, at 10:25 PM, General Marshall's car drove out, with Ambassador Stuart sitting inside. The reporter quickly followed, all the way to the ambassador's residence on Shanghai Road. The reporter jumped out of the "Jeep," took a few steps, and with a business card and a "Your Excellency," greeted the kind and approachable old scholar at his car door. He smiled and said, "A few minutes, that's fine!"</p>
<p>This was a small sitting room, with a desk and chair, a pair of sofas, a pair of soft chairs, and some simple stationery. A chandelier hung in the center of the room, and the soft light made people forget the stuffy heat from two hours ago. The reporter and the ambassador sat opposite each other on the low soft chairs, and I listened to the old scholar's soft words.</p>
<p>"I didn't go anywhere today, and I didn't see anyone. The schedule for the next few days has not been set yet. What I am doing now is arranging personal matters and preparing to present my credentials. At the same time, I am studying the current situation. Before presenting my credentials, any work is out of the question."</p>
<p>"When does the ambassador plan to meet with President Chiang? Where will you present your credentials?"</p>
<p>"That all depends on what President Chiang decides, the place to present the credentials—"</p>
<p>"Lushan?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps."</p>
<p>"I heard from Director Li of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that preparations have already been made to hold the ceremony for presenting credentials in Lushan."</p>
<p>"Very likely," the ambassador smiled. Then he said, "Tomorrow I will contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss my schedule for the next few days."</p>
<p>"When does the ambassador plan to meet with Mr. Zhou Enlai?"</p>
<p>"I haven't considered this issue yet. Before I see President Chiang and present my credentials, I am not prepared to formally meet with anyone."</p>
<p>"Is the ambassador going to hold a press conference?"</p>
<p>"I haven't prepared one yet, but I will keep your card and contact you at any time. I will definitely provide you with as much news as possible."</p>
<p>"Was the movie the ambassador watched today good? What movie was it?"</p>
<p>"Ah, not good. General Marshall asked me to watch a movie because I was tired. It was called: 'In Tangier' T. A. N... a place in northern America."</p>
<p>"Afterwards, he asked me about my studies, and he also mentioned the journalism department at Yenching University. In the soft light, I saw that he seemed tired. I thanked him for giving me this opportunity to talk, and even more thanked him for his tireless efforts for the happiness of the Chinese people." He replied to me: "I love China. I am taking on this position as a scholar to help General Marshall and work for peace in China. I hope my work will not fail."</p>
<p>At this point, I stood up, exchanged goodnights, and the reporter repeatedly thanked him for his kindness, and then took my leave.</p>
<p>It was 10:41 PM. The moonlight was like water, and the reporter was left with a deep impression—a sincere, amiable, warm, and prudent old man. I hope he can join forces with General Marshall to help us, I hope we, help ourselves, and break the current heavy and gloomy situation.</p>
<p>—Late night, July 15th</p>

<h3>UNRRA Far East Conference Solemnly Held in Shanghai Yesterday; Decision Made to Extend Transportation of Materials to China Until the End of June Next Year; Zhou Enlai Arrives in Shanghai Today to Continue Discussions on the Yellow River Damming Project</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai] The UNRRA Far East Conference resolved today: (1) To recommend to the UNRRA General Assembly in Geneva that the deadline for the transportation of UNRRA relief supplies to China be extended from March 31, 1947, to June 30, 1947. (2) To recommend that UNRRA negotiate with the Chinese government to maintain the UNRRA China Office until December 31, 1947. When the conference passed the resolution, the hope that UNRRA Director General LaGuardia would soon lift the order to suspend the transportation of materials to China gradually became stronger. The conference also voted today to pass the report of the subcommittee, with only Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu casting a dissenting vote. The report will be submitted to the UNRRA General Assembly, stating that despite various efforts, the work of distributing UNRRA relief supplies in the areas occupied by the Chinese Communist Party has not yet been completed. In recent months, the distribution work of the CNRRA has been seriously hindered due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The UNRRA Far East Conference was solemnly held yesterday morning on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Those present included China's Jiang Tingfu, Xiang Jingyun, Australia's Cowan, France's Bertin, India's Hassan, New Zealand's Shaw, Netherlands' Sterke, Britain's Miss Xingde, the Soviet Union's Seminas, and the United States' Kirkpatrick. Jiang Tingfu served as chairman, and Mr. Lai, the acting director of the UNRRA China Office who had just returned to Shanghai from Beiping, served as secretary.</p>
<p>(Morning Session)</p>
<p>After Jiang explained the agenda of the meeting, discussions began. US representative Kirkpatrick said that the CNRRA shipping team has now been handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, placing the team under a government agency, which he thought was not very appropriate. Jiang replied that in his opinion, according to UNRRA regulations, the shipping team was directly under the jurisdiction of the CNRRA. Subsequently, Mr. Saber, Director of the UNRRA Repatriation Bureau, reported that Mayor Wu had inquired whether European refugees could be repatriated as soon as possible in order to free up empty houses for our repatriated compatriots. The Chinese authorities hoped to complete the repatriation within six months, but in fact, among the 15,000 European refugees in Shanghai, only 6,000 had expressed their intention to return to their home countries. The rest wanted to go to the United States, Australia, Canada, etc., and waiting for passports approved for entry into those countries might take two or three years. Even for the refugees who wished to return to their home countries, the military authorities currently managing the European region (especially Germany and Austria) had not yet reached an agreement on their repatriation. Saber requested that the conference provide some guidance on how to handle this matter. US representative Kirkpatrick expressed deep sympathy for the difficulties UNRRA was facing, and said that it might not be easy for these refugees to go to the United States. Kirkpatrick also said that the Chinese government should pay attention to this serious issue. Jiang Tingfu replied that the CNRRA would do its best to find a solution, but the final policy would still be determined by the Chinese government. The US representative then made some statements about the treatment of Korean residents in Peiping and Tianjin, and expressed the hope that Korean residents would not be discriminated against.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative then raised an inquiry, requesting a detailed explanation of how the Ministry of Health was allocating funds from UNRRA. Jiang replied that the funds were controlled by the Chinese government, and he could not speak for the government as to whether it could provide relevant information.</p>
<p>The US representative also said that the CNRRA did not charge the Ministry of Transportation for assembling trucks and locomotives, and he believed that the Chinese government should pay a price.</p>
<p>The Indian representative suggested that the CNRRA could consider paying cash when implementing relief projects, so that flour and other items could be distributed to areas in more urgent need.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also came to listen in at around 11:00 AM and left at noon. The conference adjourned for a break at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>(Afternoon Session)</p>
<p>The meeting reconvened at 4:15 PM. The first item on the agenda was to discuss the UNRRA work period. It was decided to recommend to the Fifth General Assembly (to be held in Geneva on August 5) that the transportation of UNRRA supplies to China be extended to June 30 of the following year. At the same time, UNRRA should negotiate with China to extend the UNRRA China Office to the end of the following year. All budgets and plans regarding this point should be submitted to the Far East General Assembly for discussion before the end of this year. If there is still a need for continued transportation when the transportation period expires next year, then it can be considered whether to extend it again.</p>
<p>Regarding the internal reorganization of UNRRA, Jiang had consulted with President Song many times since late June. On July 16, President Song also held a meeting with Jiang, Lai, and several senior officials of the UNRRA China Office. In addition to the reorganization method, they also discussed how the CNRRA and UNRRA could cooperate more closely in the future. The methods decided at that time have been gradually implemented. The most important point of the reorganization is to increase the power of the Executive Director. The work of financial allocation, storage and transportation, and all branch offices, personnel, and distribution will be the responsibility of the Executive Director. However, the Director will decide when UNRRA distributes materials to the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan or other units. In addition, the Executive Yuan will send representatives to the Distribution Office. As for the UNRRA's Industrial, Mining, and Health Committees, the Executive Director must approve any sales of materials. UNRRA must also send senior officials to work at the Executive Yuan, responsible for contacting all ministries and commissions. Furthermore, if UNRRA borrows foreign personnel in the future, the Director, Deputy Director, and Executive Director must jointly decide.</p>
<p>UNRRA's overdraft expenses have now been decided not to exceed 80 billion this year, and not to exceed 30 billion in any one month.</p>
<p>The method of strengthening cooperation between UNRRA and UNRRA in the future has been decided that the process of official correspondence must be accelerated. In addition, UNRRA should be responsible for inspecting materials when they are shipped and guarantee that the materials can be used, otherwise UNRRA will not accept them. When transporting machinery, they must also provide full instructions for use and all spare parts.</p>
<p>The materials currently piled up in Shanghai warehouses are mostly heavy machinery. Efforts are being made to clear them, and Liu Hongsheng, Hua Fengxiang, Chen Guangyuan, and others have formed a clearing committee with UNRRA personnel to handle this matter.</p>
<p>From January 1 to July 10 of this year, the total amount of labor expenses received by UNRRA was 432,000,000,000 yuan in legal currency, with 172,260,117,400 yuan actually paid out, leaving a balance of 259,739,882,600 yuan. The main items of expenditure were: repairing national coal roads, the Yellow River project, miscellaneous expenses and salaries for foreign experts and other expenses, emergency relief for refugees (including refugees in northern Jiangsu, especially the two times on June 20 and July 9), coastal defense projects, and other water conservancy projects such as river embankments.</p>
<p>[Another report] Zhou Enlai is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing this morning (the 18th) to continue discussing the Yellow River damming project with Jiang Tingfu. The time is set for 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Therefore, today's UNRRA Far East Conference will be postponed until 11:30 AM.</p>
<h3>China's Allocation of UNRRA Materials Has Never Had a Political Function; Ambassador Gu Has Been Instructed by Telegram to Explain in Detail to UNRRA</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Regarding UNRRA's sudden suspension of the shipment of materials to China, both the US State Department and Special Envoy Marshall have stated to our government one after another that they were not aware of it beforehand. US Department of Agriculture expert Harrison has stated in the United States that to his knowledge, China's allocation of materials has never had a political function. Opinions from officials and people in society here believe that UNRRA is an organization of the United Nations, and China is also a sovereign state participating in its formation. UNRRA has absolutely no right to suddenly suspend the shipment of materials to any country that should receive relief without the consent of all participating countries. It is regrettable that some staff members of the UNRRA China Office were unaware of the facts and were taken advantage of, and UNRRA was too credulous. The government has instructed Ambassador Gu by telegram to explain in detail to the US government and UNRRA, and hopes for an immediate resumption.</p>

<h3>Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee Requests Formation of Joint Factories; Sends Six Representatives to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee of the China Production Promotion Association, representing more than 50 factories, sent six representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday morning and afternoon, they visited Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Minister Wang Yunwu to present their opinions on forming joint factories. Today, they went to the Executive Yuan, and Secretary Li Xunhe arranged for them to meet with President Song or Secretary-General Jiang Menglin tomorrow. At the same time, the representatives are preparing to appeal to the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supreme National Defense Council. They also plan to host a reception for the capital's press at the Lishi Society at 3:00 PM tomorrow to make a report. The group will return to Shanghai on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Xie Tianhe, the general director of the Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee affiliated with the China Production Promotion Association, recently told reporters that the association is composed of representatives from more than 50 small and medium-sized factories that moved inland to Shanghai. More than 400 factories that moved inland from the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi are also gradually being contacted to join. Most of the factories remaining in the rear are currently in a state of shutdown. After the representatives of the factories arrived in Shanghai, they were all eager to fulfill their past aspirations of serving the country through industry and to contribute to post-war reconstruction. They observed that in Shanghai, the enemy and puppet factories that had been taken over, since the authorities sold off a portion of them through bidding, most lacked buyers, resulting in an unreasonable phenomenon of factories shutting down on one hand and workers losing their jobs on the other. Although the member factories of the association intend to engage in operations, they lack the funds to purchase the factories. Therefore, after careful consideration, they drafted a "Joint Factory Plan," proposing that the authorities allocate the majority of unsold factories to the member factories of the association for joint operation. The total value of each factory should be estimated in advance, and stocks or company bonds should be issued, held by the government, and stipulated that the joint factory will begin to repurchase or repay them after one year, and pay off the entire amount in installments within ten years, so that unemployed workers can be accommodated and domestic production can be increased, and the industrialists who moved inland can continue to exert their patriotic enthusiasm. Xie finally said that the association's plan had previously received support from relevant government departments. The purpose of coming to Beijing this time is to negotiate concrete principles to make it a reality.</p>
<h3>Pan Xulun's Talk</h3>
<p>Assisting the Resettlement of Factories Moved Inland; Considering the Waiver of Principal and Interest on Industrial Loans</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the issue of assisting the resettlement of factories moved inland after the war, according to Economic Vice-Minister Pan Xulun, the government's measures are as follows: the government should assist the resettlement of factories moved inland with preferential treatment, and in principle, there is absolutely no room for doubt. (1) Because the degree of contribution of factories moved inland to the War of Resistance is different, they should receive assistance, even if they obtain an impartial standard. (2) There are also questions about whether the performance and types of enemy and puppet factories taken over in the recovered areas, in addition to a portion that has been allocated to the Resources Committee for operation, are completely suitable for the individual needs of the factories being resettled inland. It has recently been heard that a portion of factories moved inland have formed a resettlement committee and have prepared a joint factory plan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs welcomes this, but it is hoped that this type of group can expand and become widespread. As for the methods of assisting the resettlement of factories moved inland, it is not limited to the above. For example, the government's emergency industrial loans of 2.7 billion yuan to factories in the rear last year are also being considered for waiver of both principal and interest to provide relief and show encouragement.</p>

<h3>Hu Shi Spent Two Years Verifying the Waterways Classic Commentary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Chinese Historical Society held a tea party at the Capital Hotel at 10:00 AM on the 17th to welcome Dr. Hu Shi, a director of the society. Hu reported on his nine years of life in the United States, saying that he had spent two years examining 29 versions of the Waterways Classic Commentary and settling a 150-year-old scholarly dispute. Hu believes that: (1) Quan Zuwang did not write an absurd Waterways Classic Commentary, but it was written by Wang Zicai; (2) Zhao Yiqing's Waterways Classic Commentary, which continued Quan's efforts, is the best; (3) Dai Dongyuan did not see Zhao's book and took a different path to the same conclusion as Zhao, and there is no accusation of plagiarism. After Hu finished his report, he left in advance, and the society continued to discuss affairs and adjourned.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The International Harvester Company of Chicago, in order to assist our government in establishing an agricultural engineering foundation, donated US$422,000 to our government for the purpose of hiring experts, sending students, and purchasing research equipment. Our government has now hired four agricultural engineering experts, Davidson, Sisson, McCrawley, and Hanson, to come to China to work. All four are well-known agricultural engineering experts in the United States. Davidson is especially a leading figure in the agricultural engineering field, having served as the head of the agricultural engineering department at Iowa State University for more than 20 years, and many American agricultural engineers have come from his tutelage. The four are now scheduled to come to China this year, first working at the Beiping Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture, and then serving as engineering technicians at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and professors at Central University and Jinling University. The term of service is three years.

<h3>Truman Signs Bill to Assist Us in Strengthening Navy, Transferring 271 Ships to Our Country</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] President Truman today signed a bill stipulating assistance to the Republic of China in strengthening and maintaining its naval organization. The bill authorizes the President to supply China with up to 271 U.S. naval vessels, plus floating docks and other necessary materials. The bill stipulates training of sailors for these fleets, and, upon China's request, the dispatch of 100 U.S. naval officers and 200 soldiers to China. The President has discretion over the payment terms and conditions for these fleets. The Senate's report on the Naval Aid to China Bill stated that China currently only needs destroyer patrol-class and smaller light vessels. China's need to rebuild its coastal defense is similar to the vessels needed by the U.S. Coast Guard. Other vessels needed by China include those for clearing Japanese mines, repatriating Japanese, transporting overseas Chinese returning home, and developing coastal shipping. The U.S. Navy Department announced that it is willing to transfer 271 vessels to China, currently located in the Far East. This batch of surplus vessels includes two floating docks, two repair ships, two destroyer patrol vessels, twenty-four minesweepers, twenty-eight submarine chasers, one hundred and ninety-three landing craft, three oil tankers, one survey ship, six motor torpedo boats, and six pontoons and light ferries.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Byrnes' Broadcast</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, upon returning to Washington from Paris, delivered a national broadcast yesterday, reporting on the progress and results of the recent Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet representative's strong stance at the Foreign Ministers Conference, often holding solitary views, resulted in a failure to reach agreement on several important issues. Byrnes sternly criticized this Soviet policy. Indeed, since the Foreign Ministers Conference convened in Paris last month, the atmosphere in the meeting place has been quite disharmonious. On several current European issues, if Britain and the United States advocated something, the Soviet Union would invariably oppose it; if the Soviet Union advocated something, it would likewise be opposed by Britain and the United States. The unfolding of this scene truly causes apprehension. The defeat of the Axis powers originally relied on the collaborative efforts of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Now that the Axis powers have been defeated, the major powers have significant differences of opinion regarding the reconstruction of world peace. Considering the future, how can one not feel hidden worry?</p>
<p>The last Paris Foreign Ministers Conference took a very long time. Although there was a decision to convene a peace conference in Paris on July 29th, and a compromise agreement was reached on the Trieste issue, several major issues remain unresolved. The plan to control Germany was shelved due to the Soviet Union's solitary opposition; there was also no achievement on the Austrian issue due to the Soviet Union's solitary dissent. Even the agreement reached on Trieste, in its nature, did not resolve the Trieste issue in any way. Merely having an international organization manage the area often not only fails to eliminate the problem, but instead makes it increasingly serious. Danzig and Memel are precedents. The agreement reached on Trieste at this Foreign Ministers Conference, entrusting Trieste to the control of the United Nations, is sufficient to show mutual concessions. However, it has not provided a thorough resolution to this thorny issue, leaving future problems behind. Why could a thorough resolution not be reached on this issue? For Britain and the United States, it is because the Soviet Union has swept through Eastern Europe, and its expansion must be curbed. For the Soviet Union, it is because Trieste is the main port for Eastern and Central Europe to access the sea. Acquiring Trieste would be enough to control the Adriatic Sea, shaking the advantage of Britain and the United States in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the Soviet Union also wants to acquire Italy's colonies in North Africa. Its intentions originally had profound strategic significance. The Trieste issue is a test of the competition of power. Both sides insisted on not yielding, and therefore had to seek points where they could compromise within that insistence. Therefore, the Trieste issue looks like it is resolved, but in reality, it is not.</p>
<p>Since the defeat of the Axis powers, international diplomacy in this past year has everywhere revealed the inability of Soviet and British-American policies to coordinate. The Soviet Union single-handedly resisted the brutal enemy in Eastern Europe, creating a glorious battlefield. This naturally easily aroused a sense of psychological superiority in the Soviet Union. Based on this sense of superiority, it looked down on the world, and then actively extended its power. All of this conflicted with the policies of Britain and the United States. Policy is the expression of thought. The lack of coordination in policy between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is actually due to differences in thought. We must remember that the Soviet Union itself is an international organization. Its original name was "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." The so-called Russia is only a part of the "Soviet Union." The purpose of this international organization is naturally not limited to encompassing the territory of the Tsarist empire. Its ultimate goal is for the entire world to belong to the "Soviet Union." With the collapse of the Axis powers, the Soviet Union's military strength reached an unprecedented level. At this time, it is understandable that the Soviet Union wanted to actively expand its power. Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Bullitt, said in his recent book "The Great Globe Itself," "The totalitarian imperialism that threatens the whole world today is none other than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is to establish a Communist dictatorship throughout the world. If the United States does not immediately take various steps to stop its growth, it must submit to it. We are seen as a giant with feet of clay by the world, and the people who follow our lead have begun to doubt whether we are intelligent and resourceful enough to plan for freedom and peace. We rely on the atomic bomb and a large air force, so today we are stronger than the Soviet Union and can destroy it. But if we know that the Soviet government intends to wage war against us in the future and strike first, this action will lower our moral standards and become one with the Communists."</p>
<p>Bullitt was an early sympathizer of the Bolshevik Revolution, and also served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He had a deep understanding of the Soviet Union. His publication of the above remarks, though inevitably a bit excessive, shows that he was well aware of the Soviet Union's ambition to rule the world. It is this fundamental difference in thought that causes a conflict in policy between Britain and the United States regarding the reconstruction of world peace. We are geographically connected to the Soviet Union. For the sake of lasting world peace, we always hope that this difference in thought and conflict in policy can be coordinated, so that the distance between them can become smaller and smaller. Therefore, when we talk about Byrnes' broadcast, and see him say, "We do not believe that peace should be based on revenge. We believe in true selfless generosity. If we treat others with kindness and compassion, we can turn enemies into friends. We must trust in peace, and pray that God will have mercy and grant world peace," we cannot help but feel a full of sympathy. This task is arduous; but if we treat others with kindness and compassion, who knows if we cannot turn enemies into friends. We are moved by such a devout religious spirit. Using this spirit to overcome difficulties should be successful in everything. We respectfully extend our respect and admiration to Byrnes, and hope that his efforts will succeed!</p>

<p>#### Women's Prison Overcrowding</p>
<p>The Tilanqiao Women's Prison originally held approximately 120 female prisoners, but all of its prison cells can only accommodate 200 female prisoners. Since about 50 female prisoners were transferred from the detention centers on Masnan Road and North Zhejiang Road a few days ago, the total number of female prisoners held has reached more than 170. According to news from the prison, many of the female prisoners are poor and sick, and prison doctors are currently trying to treat them and are intensifying prevention measures. The situation has been reported to the court authorities, requesting them to instruct the various detention centers not to transfer large numbers of female prisoners to the prison again to avoid overcrowding.</p>
<p>#### Training Camp on Fuxing Island</p>
<p>Training Three Naval Battalions</p>
<p>The First Battalion to be Assigned to Warships After Graduation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The United States has gifted us a total of 271 ships, of which 8 warships have already been received by us and sailed to Tokyo. Landing craft are also being delivered to us one after another. Our naval authorities have recently been training a large number of naval soldiers in Jiangyin, Shanghai, and other places to meet the demand. The First Naval Training Camp recently moved from Nanshi to Fuxing Island in Pudong, which was previously the Japanese naval base. When reporters visited the island yesterday to inquire about the naval training situation, Deputy Camp Commander Zhao said: The camp currently has three training battalions. The first and second battalions were recruited, and the third battalion consists of youth soldiers transferred from other units. The four-month training period for the first battalion is coming to an end, and graduation is scheduled to take place around the 20th. After graduation, they will be assigned to the warships gifted to us by the United States. These warships will sail to Nanjing for stationing after arriving in Shanghai from Tokyo. Approximately 200 trainees will graduate this time and will continue to receive training on the warships for two months before being promoted to formal third-class privates.</p>
<p>#### Mayor's Wife Hosts Tea Party</p>
<p>To Entertain Representatives from Women's Christian Association from Various Places</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu's wife hosted a tea party at her official residence at 201 Anfu Road yesterday at 5:00 PM, inviting representatives and committee members of the National Association of the Women's Christian Association's Enlarged Executive Committee from various places. Those present included Mrs. Zhu Shiming, Vice President of the World Women's Christian Association, Mrs. Mei Yibao, former Chairman of the Women's Christian Association, Mrs. Ling Xianyang, Chairman of the Association, Ms. Cai Kui, Secretary-General, American representatives Geng Lishu, Liang Qiying, Mu Lishu, British representative Gan Renpei, Indian representative Ms. Martha, and representatives from major cities across the country, totaling about 60 people. The Mayor's wife extended warm hospitality, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious, dispersing at 6:30 PM. The representatives then attended a dinner at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, invited by the Youth Association Advancement Association, the National Association of Youth Associations, and the Shanghai Municipal Youth Association. The Enlarged Executive Committee meeting opened on the 11th of this month and holds daily meetings at Hujiang University in Yangshupu to discuss promoting work and plan for the World Women's Christian Association to be held in China next year. The meeting is expected to close at the end of this month.</p>
<p>#### Eight US-Donated Warships</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive at Wusong Estuary Tonight</p>
<p>Whether to Stop in Shanghai or Sail Directly to Nanjing Remains Undetermined</p>
<p>The eight warships donated to us by the US government left South America in April of this year, passing through San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, and Midway Island. After three months, they arrived in Tokyo on the 11th and departed for China on the 15th. The journey is expected to arrive at the Wusong Estuary at 9:00 PM tonight. However, whether they will enter the Huangpu River to stop in Shanghai or sail directly to Nanjing to report to the Naval Headquarters has not been determined due to a lack of orders from the Nanjing Headquarters. It is reported that when these eight ships set sail from the United States, the Naval Attaché to the United States, Liu Tianfu, and the leader of the fleet, Colonel Lin Zun, held a reception ceremony. Among them, two were escort destroyers (each weighing 1,300 tons), two were anti-submarine ships (each weighing 1,100 tons), and four were minesweeper/minelayers (each weighing 800 tons). More than 80 naval officers and more than 1,000 soldiers, who were sent to the United States for training by our country in 1944, sailed back to China, led by Colonel Lin Zun as the overall leader. In addition to the eight warships, there was also a transport ship specially dispatched by the United States.</p>
<p>#### Pickpockets Active on Trolleys</p>
<p>Passengers Wearing Strange Hats for Advertisement</p>
<p>Pickpocketing is rampant on the city's trams, and the general public is complaining. Although the police authorities have made every effort to suppress it, it is still difficult to completely eliminate. Yesterday, on the French-owned No. 7 tram running on the Bund and Rue Cardinal Foch, a passenger wore a paper hat similar to that of a "Wu Chang" (a figure from Chinese mythology), with the words "Beware of Pickpockets" written on it. Passengers in the tram covered their mouths and laughed, and passers-by also stopped to watch. According to the person, he had been visited by pickpockets four times in one month, and the loss of money was not small. This would make tram passengers pay attention at all times, and pickpockets would be seen and avoided.</p>
<p>#### Selling Paintings to Make a Living in a Small Corner Building</p>
<p>Yuan Xiluo's Life is Simple and Hard</p>
<p>"If Mao Zedong and the others continue to stir things up like this, I'm afraid it won't do them or the country any good, and we will suffer even more." The highly respected Mr. Yuan Xiluo said in his slow Baoshan accent.</p>
<p>Yes, Yuan Xiluo said so. This can represent the views of sincere and pure elders—perhaps you don't remember, when Premier Sun Yat-sen took office as the Provisional President, Mr. Yuan was the representative who presented the seal. However, at the age of 71, he lives in a small corner building near the French Park, supporting his simple remaining years by selling calligraphy, paintings, and fan paintings for meager income.</p>
<p>When reporters went to visit him presumptuously, Mr. Yuan was painting a "Huangshan" fan painting. Although the high building seemed simple, it was spotless and exceptionally elegant, matching the light colors of the painting.</p>
<p>Yuan Xiluo devoted his life to education, so he was content with simplicity and remained the same for decades. In 1933, he served as the magistrate of Nanhui County for three years and was also a pioneer in establishing Qidong as a new county under a branch customs office. However, apart from a bonus of more than ten thousand yuan from the authorities, he still returned empty-handed.</p>
<p>With this bonus, Mr. Yuan bought some sandy land in Qidong and built a house. He planted hundreds of plum trees in front and a vegetable garden in the back. Mr. Yuan planned to be a citizen of Ge Tian, uncontested with the world, in those small houses—who knew that the disaster of all Chinese people would come.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Japanese occupation of Qidong, he fled to Shanghai. Life began to squeeze out his only savings like a high-pressure bed. Mr. Yuan's fate was the same as that of all those who sought refuge in Shanghai but were not good at (or unwilling) to plunder. Gradually, the money dried up like water, and daily meals became simpler in proportion.</p>
<p>He could have been promoted and made a fortune. Weren't many traitors emerging, eating delicacies, and living extravagantly? Haven't they come up with all kinds of nice-sounding excuses to cover up their past deeds today? One said: "I was forced by the enemy and puppet regime." Another said: "I was forced by life." At that time, Mr. Yuan Xiluo, who was under the pressure of life, had not been surrounded by villains. The Japanese wanted him to maintain the local area, but he refused. The Wang Jingwei government wanted him to be the Minister of Civil Affairs, but he also refused. They even asked him to go to Nanjing to run a library, but the old gentleman also refused.</p>
<p>He silently tightened his belt and wrote all six volumes of the "History of the Japanese Invasion of China War". When the Japanese searched the Hongying Library, he secretly took them home to write. In his bitter heart, there was only one hope: victory. However, victory did not bring him anything, because prices were scorched by the raging flames of war, making it impossible for every honest ordinary people to survive. Therefore, Mr. Yuan Xiluo also uttered a weak cry: "Stop it, why doesn't the Communist Party withdraw from northern Jiangsu? Why don't they give up the army? Can't the suffering ordinary people have a chance to recuperate?"</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan once thought about going to Yan'an to starve himself to death, and he also wrote two articles on the "Datong Liyunpian" and handed them over to Zhou Enlai to forward them to Mao Zedong and Zhu De for "elegant recitation". Thanks to the gift of the two men, Yuan Xiluo makes a living by painting fans (excuse me for saying so). However, it is not a crime, so why be ashamed? (Zhong Shi).

<p>#### Gan Deyun Sent Back for Retrial</p>
<p>Stating that Opposing England is His Consistent Stance</p>
<p>Xu Xiqing and Liu Shengwu to be Sentenced on the 24th</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gan Deyun, also known as Gan Weilu, 62 years old, his father was English and his mother was Cantonese. Because he opposed the English government's policies towards China in his early years, the English government revoked his citizenship. Gan then became a Chinese citizen in 1926. He joined the Lawyers Association in 1936 and practiced law in Shanghai. In the spring of 1940, he met Chen Gongbo through Wen Zongyao and joined the puppet government, serving as a "Legislative Member" until he resigned in 1942. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Gan founded the English publication "The Voice of New China" to promote the rejection of Britain and the United States. After the victory, the British Naval Office in Shanghai reported him to the city police, and Gan was arrested and transferred to the court, which sentenced him to seven years in prison. Gan expressed his disagreement and appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting a retrial. The case was sent back for retrial and was heard again by a collegial panel in the High Court yesterday morning. Gan used English to recount how he had helped the government recover the British Concession in Hankou and abolish unequal treaties in the past. He also stated that opposing British imperialism was his consistent stance, not only during the enemy and puppet regime. He also stated that he had no work as a "Legislative Member" and did not participate in advocacy because he did not understand the national language. The trial of the case concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 24th. On the same day, the cases of Xu Xiqing, editor-in-chief of the puppet Central News Agency, Liu Shengwu, magistrate of the puppet Chongming County, and Ge Shengwen, a puppet agent, were also concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 24th. In addition, the case of Pan Amao, a secret agent of the puppet Yin County Security Team, was scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on the 23rd.

<p>#### 1946 License Tax Collected at the Same Rate as Last Term</p>
<p>Deadline for Payment is the End of August</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The business license tax for this year was announced and levied by the Finance Bureau earlier. Now, due to the difficulty in adjusting capital in various industries, it has not been completed on schedule. The municipal government has stipulated that the business license tax for this year may still be levied at the same rate as the previous license to avoid difficulties. The deadline for declaration and payment is the end of August, and a fine will be added for late payment. After the implementation of this changed method, the long-unsettled tax collection standard will be resolved. After the announcement of the regulations for business licenses, there were many disputes over the scope of collection. The Finance Bureau has now requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance again.</p>
<p>#### Fourteen Major Types of Chinese Export Goods</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the first preparatory meeting of the China Export Goods Exhibition was held a few days ago, various departments are actively promoting the work in order to hold the exhibition on schedule on the first day of September at the Youth Association Building on the first and second floors of this city. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Zhang Yifan, Secretary-General of the China National Economic Research Institute, who is responsible for the publicity work of the exhibition, and learned the details of the exhibition. It is reported that the initiators of the exhibition are the Youth Association, the Shanghai Import and Export Industry Commercial Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Import and Export Trade Association, the China National Goods Production and Marketing Association, and the Zhengyan Daily Economic News. At present, the preparatory committee has established six departments: general affairs, publicity, collection, exhibition, finance, and review, which are responsible for various initiating agencies. It is reported that there are 14 major export products in China that are prepared to provide exhibitions. (1) Native products include tea, tung oil, raw silk, pig bristles, casings, tungsten ore, and other minerals. (2) Important machine-made industrial products include glassware, enamelware, thermos bottles, and cotton fabrics. (3) Handicrafts include embroidery, drawnwork, and lace.

<p>#### Wang Xingjian Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>One Year and Four Months</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Xingjian, a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Datong University, currently works at the Ministry of Communications. He was reported as a traitor. After many months of trial by the High Court, he was finally sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment for conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. It is reported that Wang joined the Loyal Salvation Army at the beginning of the war and worked. Later, he was arrested by the enemy's police and served at the "76" and "Central Savings Bank." However, he still maintained contact with the rear agencies and regularly communicated news. Therefore, when the sentence was pronounced yesterday, the judge explained that because the defendant's initial participation in the puppet position was out of necessity, and he had made some contributions to assisting the war of resistance, the sentence was reduced again and again. If the defendant is not satisfied, he can appeal to the Supreme Court for review. Wang is currently released on bail and needs to wait for the retrial before deciding whether to execute the sentence.</p>
<p>#### Cai Pei to be Sentenced Today</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Pan Yangyao, founder of the China Vocational Education Society, remained in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. After the victory, the authorities arrested him on suspicion of being an economic traitor and transferred him to the court.

<p>In addition, Guo Zhenxiang, a detective team member of the Puppet Dongchang Road Police Station, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of political rights. Wu Baofu was found not guilty.</p>
<p>#### Xu Jiang on Trial</p>
<p>Amassing Wealth by Controlling Materials</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court opened a court yesterday afternoon to try the case of Xu Jiang, the former director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. It was found that Xu worked in the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications before the war. He joined the puppet government after the war and successively served as the section chief of the Puppet Taxation Bureau, the director of the Puppet Silk Construction Special Tax Office, the director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, and a director of the Puppet Xieji Company. During his tenure, he forcibly occupied tax revenue, harmed the silk industry, controlled various materials, handled commodity registration, and purchased food to support the enemy. Xu also amassed wealth and acquired a lot of property. After being questioned by the judge yesterday, he was ordered to reschedule the trial.</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Sun Wenhai, the former chief of the training section of the Puppet Special Headquarters, Zheng Liangbin, the former director of the Puppet Huazhong Shipping Company, Li Xingyi, a businessman suspected of aiding the enemy, and Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang, the owners of the La Dahua Dance Hall and the Venus Cafe, were all rescheduled for retrial.</p>
<p>#### Dai Buxiang and Others Summoned for Concealing Xie Baosheng's Property</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court Prosecutor's Office summoned Dai Buxiang (manager of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road) and Xie Wenkui to the court yesterday morning for questioning, because the two were suspected of concealing the property of Xie Baosheng, the former deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department. After the prosecutor opened a court to investigate, he ordered them to be released on bail pending summons.</p>
<p>#### British Airways Contract Expires, Our Transportation is Sufficient</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The contract signed by the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) with the British shipping company to transport relief materials has expired and been cancelled. The reporter visited the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday to inquire about the subsequent handling. It is reported that although CNRRA previously signed contracts with British companies to transport relief materials, some of them were also transported by Chinese shipping companies. After the cancellation of the contract, the company and other Chinese companies will take over all the transportation. The transportation capacity should be sufficient.</p>
<p>#### Taikoo Jardine Company Clarifies Business Position</p>
<p>[Another Report] The British shipping companies Taikoo and Jardine, in order to clarify their own business position and make statements regarding maritime trade rights in China, have issued a joint declaration (see this newspaper on the 16th). In order to understand the facts, the reporter visited the authorities of each company. According to them, "Our company fully supports China's relief work since the signing of the Sino-British Treaty in 1943. Looking back on our operations since then, for six months, all the goods loaded were mainly relief supplies from CNRRA; and the routes sailed were also based on the needs of relief materials. Under the circumstances that the freight rate for relief supplies is lower than that for passengers and cargo, the company has been able to adhere to this principle unswervingly. Its hard work in safeguarding China's relief work and promoting China's economic recovery is clearly demonstrated."</p>
<p>#### Wenhui Daily Suspended for One Week</p>
<p>The Wenhui Daily was suspended yesterday. According to news released by the police station, "The Wenhui Daily usually publishes articles attacking security agencies, fabricating reasons, and so on. A few days ago, it published two letters from 'A Policeman' and 'An Inspector', which contained many fabricated facts, alienating emotions, and disrupting public order. After the bureau sent personnel to request to read the original manuscript, the newspaper failed to point out who submitted it, and used the name of the police to fabricate news, confusing the public. At this time of turbulent situation, security is of utmost importance, and it is absolutely not allowed to provoke discord and divide the strength of the military and police, which would hinder security. The bureau had no choice but to follow the order of the garrison headquarters and impose a one-week suspension on the newspaper in accordance with the Publication Law and the Martial Law."</p>
<p>#### Young and Inexperienced, Seeking Trouble for Oneself</p>
<p>A Murder Case Leads to Further Complications</p>
<p>Defamation Case Scheduled for Sentencing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On March 7 of this year, at 4:00 PM, when Shen Youqi was passing through the intersection of East Zhongzheng Road and Jiangxi Road, he was knocked down by a bicycle ridden by student Xu Peihuang. He was sent to the hospital and died. The family members of the deceased filed a lawsuit in court. The District Court sentenced Xu Peihuang to four months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence for the crime of negligent injury resulting in death. The defendant disagreed with the sentence and appealed to the High Court while writing a letter to a newspaper, pointing out that the family members of the deceased had negotiated with his father, Xu Shihui, to settle the case with 25 gold bars, and believed that the trial of the case in court was also unfair. After the article was published, the District Court and the family members of the deceased believed that it was suspected of insulting and defaming them, and the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution again. Shen Zhongxiqin, the wife of the deceased, also filed a private prosecution and filed a civil suit against Xu's father, requesting that he be punished according to the law and demanding that the full text of the judgment in this case be published in the newspaper for three days to admit his fault. Because it was the same case, the case was jointly tried by Judge Shen Tianbao in Criminal Division 4 of the District Court yesterday morning. After questioning, the verdict was scheduled for the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>#### Invited by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Staff Association</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Attends Lecture</p>
<p>Explaining Problems Such as Rice and Housing Allocation in Detail</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu attended a lecture at the Duchen Hotel yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM at the invitation of the "UNRRA" Staff Association. Mr. Lei, the Director of the Far East Office of "UNRRA", and Mr. Luo, the Chairman of the Association, accompanied him. About 150 Chinese and foreign members attended. Mr. Lei praised Mayor Wu's wisdom, ability, and determination in administration, and stood up to introduce Mr. Wu's outstanding achievements in the past.</p>
<p>#### Grain Situation</p>
<p>Mayor Wu first reported on the grain situation in the city, stating briefly: The sources of rice supply in the city include about 300 rice merchants, more than 1,700 rice shops, and a small number of Chen farmers who transport rice from the suburbs. Since I took over the work in Shanghai on May 20, the most difficult thing I have encountered is dealing with the rice problem. According to the regulations, rice merchants should charge a commission of 2% when selling rice to rice shops, but in reality, rice merchants do not sell rice to rice shops but resell and hoard among themselves, raising prices. At the same time, some rice merchants set the price of each stone of rice at 70,000 yuan and charged a commission of 10%. After the municipal government conducted a rice registration, the results showed that there was a total of 430,000 dan of rice in storage, but it was not known whether the registration procedures were duplicated. Part of the rice was registered by the rice merchants or rice shops, and the rice mills registered again, resulting in an actual amount of only 300,000 dan. Five weeks ago, the price of rice soared. The municipal government could not control it because there was insufficient rice in storage. After requesting the allocation from the Grain and Resources Department, it has been temporarily resolved. Currently, the brown rice transported from Sichuan or Jiangxi is rich in vitamins, but when I first came to Shanghai, the city's workers were unwilling to buy brown rice, and the rice shops were unwilling to sell it. After compulsory enforcement, it has been adopted. Currently, if the city has 250,000 dan of rice per month, it is sufficient to cope, but at present, during the transition period, there is not much rice in storage in July, and civil servants, teachers, and workers must be assisted and supplied with low-priced rice. The price should not exceed 51,000 yuan (including profit and transportation costs), but for the propertied class who like to eat the best rice and do not care about the price, it can be slightly increased to 71,000 yuan per stone. After the new grain is launched in September of this year, all problems can be solved. Before the war, our country needed to import 1 million tons of foreign rice every year, so today we hope for the assistance of foreign rice. The United Nations Food Control Committee is not fair in the allocation of food. Malaysia, India, and other places do not have food shortages, but they are allocated a lot of food. Our country's food shortage is serious, but we only get 50,000 tons, which is incomprehensible. At the same time, I hope that the United Nations Food Committee can provide 10,000 tons of the fourth batch of 50,000 tons of rice allocated to China in July and 10,000 tons in August to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>#### Dock Thieves</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also said that he has taken measures to deal with the petty thieves at the docks who steal incoming and outgoing goods, and will crack down on them. It will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>#### Housing Allocation</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of housing allocation, Mayor Wu reported that the US Consulate General and the US Navy have priority in allocating German overseas Chinese houses, and the "UNRRA" also has priority. The quantity and agencies allocated have a list for inspection. Laws are enacted to relocate German overseas Chinese, but because some houses are inhabited by German overseas Chinese, while others are Chinese or Americans, relocation is difficult. It is now stipulated that all leases signed before April 20 are invalid. Mayor Wu finally sincerely asked the "UNRRA" staff for assistance and cooperation and guaranteed to show the public with practical relief work. Chairman Luo immediately stood up to express his gratitude and replied that he would do his best to help China.</p>
<p>#### Military Law Department Interrogates Grain Merchants</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Preparations Department's Military Law Department Joint Court interrogated Wang Xunzhi of the Changjiang Company all day yesterday. Based on the results of the accountant's review of the account books, the interrogation was very detailed, and it was not completed until evening. The interrogation will continue this morning, and Wu Rongsheng of the Santai Rice Shop will be interrogated this afternoon.</p>
<p>#### Increasing Number of Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>Life Urgently Needs Relief</p>
<p>Yu Pu Talks About the General Work of the Temporary Relief Association</p>
<p>The number of refugees from northern Jiangsu fleeing to Shanghai is gradually increasing, and their lives urgently need relief. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and Chairman of Jiangsu Province Wang Maogong have come to Shanghai several times to raise relief funds. Shanghai has also established a relief organization for refugees from northern Jiangsu, and under the enthusiastic leadership of Zhu Hua and Gu Zhuhong, work has been actively launched. Yesterday, the reporter visited Yu Pu, the person in charge of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu, and asked about the current situation of the association's general work. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>#### Relief Organization Divided into Three Agencies</p>
<p>The relief organization for refugees from northern Jiangsu is divided into three agencies: (1) The Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference. The general agency is located in Zhenjiang, presided over by various ministers and Chairman Wang, and is responsible for refugee relief assessment, distribution, and supervision. It is the highest relief agency. Zhu Hua and Gu Zhuqi are the main and deputy directors of the Shanghai Office. (2) The Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu. The association was initiated by the Jiangbei Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Service Society and has been approved by the Executive Yuan Rehabilitation and Relief Administration to distribute relief materials. Zhu Hua also serves as the chief standing committee member of the association. The association is divided into five groups: general affairs, registration, service, condolence, and storage, which are responsible for refugee registration, job placement, small loans, and storage of youth relief materials. It is an organization that actually carries out relief tasks. (3) The Shanghai Branch of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. The general association is located in Zhenjiang, and Chairman Wang serves as the chairman. Zhu Hua, chairman of the Shanghai Branch, also serves concurrently. His job is to assist the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Temporary Relief Committee in handling various matters that should be handled.</p>
<p>#### Unable to Make a Living and Becoming Beggars</p>
<p>Since its establishment on June 3, the Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu has conducted two registrations. The first registration was from June 19 to 21, and the second was from July 9 to 11. A total of more than 40,000 refugees were registered. In terms of origin, Yancheng has the most refugees, and Xuhai has the fewest. In terms of occupation, farmers account for one-half, and workers and small businessmen account for one-half. In addition, there are more than 1,700 unemployed and out-of-school youth. These people in Shanghai are unable to make a living, and it is difficult for them to provide for their own food and clothing. There are quite a few who have become beggars. The number of refugees who have not registered with the association cannot be counted.</p>
<p>#### Insufficient Relief Supplies</p>
<p>The relief materials received by the association so far only include 4,000 shi of flour donated by the First Supply Area of the Logistics Command, 400,000 jin of red beans and peas, 200,000 jin of corn, and a small amount of other grains. Recently, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference in Zhenjiang began to allocate 200 tons of flour from CNRRA relief, which has not yet arrived. The relief donations only include 100 million yuan remitted by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, accounting for one-fortieth of the total relief donations of the association (the relief funds for Northern Jiangsu refugees, in addition to the 200 million yuan allocated by the government, Shanghai has also raised 200 million yuan, totaling 400 million yuan). In addition, in order to conduct a small loan, 12 million yuan was temporarily borrowed from the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Provincial Bank. The small amount feels like a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to distribute.</p>
<p>#### Overall Planning for Practical Results</p>
<p>As for how to distribute it, the association plans to hand over the materials to various fellow countryman associations in northern Jiangsu, including the Jianghuai Fellow Countryman Association, the Tongru Chonghai Fellow Countryman Association, the Yangshu Seven Counties Fellow Countryman Association, the Haishu Four Counties City Fellow Countryman Association, and the Baoying Fellow Countryman Association. Based on the number of registered people, the association will make overall arrangements for relief. In addition to flour, the association has made the grain donated by the Logistics Department into mixed flour, all bagged, and will issue it. In addition to the small loan of 12 million yuan, the cash part of 100 million yuan will be directly distributed by the association to students who are studying and unemployed and out-of-school youth for relief. It has not yet been specifically decided how much each person can get and according to what standard to distribute. Recently, Northern Jiangsu students who stayed in school during the summer vacation at various universities have successively applied for relief, and the association is investigating and reviewing them separately. In short, the association was established to relieve refugees from Northern Jiangsu, and every drop will be given to all refugees. However, how to achieve the principle of fairness and universality and truly solve the refugees' livelihood difficulties requires guidance and assistance from people in the association and fellow countryman from Northern Jiangsu to achieve practical results.</p>

<p>Publishing World's Yellow Publications Revived!</p>
<p>Dangerous Words</p>
<p>In the recent past, the city government made a firm determination to thoroughly cleanse this city of some poisonous yellow publications. The so-called poisonous elements refer to those containing obscene inquiries, theft, and fabricated rumors. Shanghai, in China, can be considered a culturally advanced metropolis. However, this so-called culture represents a petty-bourgeois culture. Tastes are quite low. The psychology of the general petty bourgeoisie is that they have some spare time to kill and are willing to spend a little money, and the places they enjoy most are those of sensuality and extravagance. Some yellow publications arise to meet this need.</p>
<p>The publication of publications that have a segment of searches is originally a cause for celebration in cultural undertakings. At the same time, to develop culture in a society, one fears that no one is cultivating this spirit-like undertaking, even more fears that there are no masses to support it. Therefore, we feel that the publication of small publications is not a bad thing in itself. However, many publications in Shanghai often only seek to cater to low-level tastes, maintain the sales of the publications, and do not hesitate to report on scandals and social trends. It still has a negative impact on public sentiment. Therefore, the city government is determined to clean it up, which is indeed a good policy.</p>
<p>In recent days, we have seen these yellow publications revived on newsstands. Of course, this has already been permitted by the municipal party authorities. Fortunately, we are not against the publication of publications by Shanghai's cultural circles in principle, but we hope that these listed publications will also improve the level of interest and use a relaxed and interesting style to propagate everything related to international or domestic political, economic, and social situations in a positive and detailed manner. As for exposing the darkness of society and commenting on the gains and losses of common politics, this is not impossible, but the arguments must be absolutely responsible, and the motives must be completely pure. As for the authorities in charge of publishing management, on the one hand, they must respect the people's freedom of speech, and on the other hand, they must pay attention to their content, and strive for their success as a beneficial educational tool. I hope that the officials will not only pay attention to the legal procedures.</p>
<h3>Me and Education</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenyu</p>
<p>Original by Shu Xincheng</p>
<p>Published by Zhonghua Book Company, First Edition in Early February of the 35th Year</p>
<p>"Me and Education" is an autobiographical work in which the author uses 200,000 words to describe his educational and writing life from 1893 to 1928. We first analyze it from the perspective of modern Chinese history. From 1893 to 1928 was a period when Chinese culture turned from old-fashioned construction to innovation and westernization. Whether from political economy, thought, or academic aspects, it was a period of great change. The author's childhood and adolescence were spent in such a historical background. He heard, saw, and personally experienced the educational environment of the time, and put these situations into medicine. This medicine is not only the author's autobiography, but also reflects the educational situation at the time and the general public's concept of education.</p>
<p>Why did the author write this book? The author said in the "Preface": "All educational events related to my personal life, educational experience, educational insights, educational ideals, and educational methods, as well as personal educational experience, can be freely told for everyone to criticize." (December of the 20th year) The author wrote in "After Finishing Writing": "I now want to use literary descriptive methods to write several "Me and What" to express my entire life in childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and middle age." (July of the 30th year) He also said in "A Small Note Before Printing": "I have been living on writing for more than 30 years. I think what I can leave to society is only writing. I still have this ambition today and plan to devote my remaining years to writing in order to complete this wish!" (January of the 35th year)</p>
<p>The author was born in May 1893 and grew up in a small agricultural society permeated with feudal thoughts. His mother wanted him to study and achieve fame. Before the age of five, he entered a private school in his hometown—Liujia Ferry, Shupu, Hunan. There were several changes in his private school life, from Liujia Private School to Hu Family School, Yilongwangjiang Private School, Huilongge Private School, and Zhang Family School. Finally, his private school life transformed into a academy life - Lang School. In the autumn of 1908, because the academy was changed into a school, the author bid farewell to the academy and transferred to the county-level higher elementary school. During his high school days, the author participated in the elementary school teacher examination and worked as an elementary school teacher. In 1911, the winter of the year of the Wuchang Uprising, the author married Ms. He Juduan. After the founding of the Republic of China, he entered Changde Second Normal School in the first year of the Republic of China. In the spring of the same year, he entered the preparatory course for studying abroad in Changsha, and in the summer of the same year, he entered Wenchang Middle School in Wuchang. In the autumn of the same year, he transferred to Yuelu Higher Normal School. The author ended his student life after four years in Yuelu. The author's teacher life began with a trial in the summer of 1911. At that time, he was expelled from the high school due to the revolution, and he had no choice but to teach gymnastics and arithmetic in the school. But it really started in the spring of 1917 when he taught music in Duize Middle School. In the summer of 1918, the Hunan Education Association held a summer training class, and the author served as an education instructor, which was the beginning of the author's research on education. The author's initial influences were Thorndike's "Educational Psychology" and Dewey's "Democracy and Education". After the end of the summer school, he was transferred to the post of director of academic affairs and education teacher at Fuxiang Girls' School, which was run by the church at that time, and it was at this time that the foundation for educational writing was laid. At this time, the author had educational experience, and the interest in academic research was also flourishing. At the same time, the environment of the times also gave the author some influence, because the May Fourth Movement came, and the New Culture Movement gave the author a great stimulus. In November 1919, he resigned from his position at Fuxiang and engaged in writing in Changsha from June 1920, preparing for the "Hunan Education Monthly". Soon, due to the chaos of the political situation in Hunan, he went to Shanghai. Two months after arriving in Shanghai, the Hunan Provincial First Normal School hired him as a teacher of education. He only stayed in Hunan First Normal School for one year. In September 1921, he came to Shanghai again to serve as the director of the middle school of China Public School. He encountered two disturbances in the school. In 1922, the author and ten colleagues in Zhonggong Middle School did a lot of things: (1) Implementing a five-year ability grouping system and elective system, (2) Implementing a six-year new school system, (3) Implementing a counseling system for moral education, (4) Implementing a non-work system for physical education, (5) Setting up subject classrooms, (6) Adopting the Dalton system for teaching, (7) Implementing coeducation. In February 1923, the author's family still lived in Nanjing, engaged in academic research and writing for a living, and spent a period of lecturing, so as to visit several secondary educational institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and the Yangtze River basin. In October 1924, the author was hired by the National Chengdu Higher Normal School and traveled east to Sichuan to serve as a professor in the Department of Education. In the spring and summer of the following year, he encountered danger in a "teacher-student love" case and left Chengdu very embarrassedly, returning to Shanghai, thus ending his teacher life. The author's writing life began in November 1919, when he wrote some "Notes" and tried to write novels, creating two books, "Snow-covered Bloodstains" and "Field Records". The beginning of educational writing was in the summer of 1919, when he compiled "Psychological Principles and Practical Education". In the summer of 1922, the "Educational Psychology" compiled by the author based on Thorndike's educational psychology was published by the Commercial Press. In May 1923, "Introduction to Psychology" was published by Zhonghua Book Company. In August of the same year, the "Civics Textbook" was published by Hua Publishing House. In 1924, he completed the book "Philosophy of Life". The author is famous for introducing the Dalton system. There are four books about the Dalton system: "Overview of the Dalton System" in May 1923, "Collection of Discussions on the Dalton System" in March 1924, "Research on the Wilton System" in June of the same year, and "A Brief Explanation of the Dalton System" in June of the same year (all published by Zhonghua). In December 1993, Zhonghua published Thorndike's original "On Individuality" translated by the author, and in October 1924, Zhonghua published Moore's original "The Trend of Modern Psychology" translated by the author. In October 1925, "First Draft of Education" was published by Zhonghua. In 1927, "Shu Jin Xin Ying" was written. All of the above are named as side jobs by Zhu Ming. So, what is the main job? The author's ideal and plan is: "To create a private college where students can live by their own labor, work together, and encourage each other." In order to establish the college, the author planned to use the income from writing as a tool to solve the financial problems. However, the author's ideal was never completed, and the college was not established. After taking office as the director of the editorial office of Zhonghua Book Company on New Year's Day in 1930, he could only work hard in editing and publishing. However, the writings on education were continuously published by Zhonghua; he translated Burkehurst's "Individual Homework and Dao Liangdun System" (1925), "A Chinese Education Dictionary" (1928), "Zhonghua Zhike Cihuang" (1930). "General Theory of Education" (1926), "Modern Education Methods" (1930 - Commercial), "Historical Materials of Modern Chinese Education" (1926), "Overview of New Education in China" (1927), "Education Guide" (1925-1926), "History of Studying Abroad in Modern China" (1927), "History of Educational Thought in Modern China" (19129), and some other educational papers. This is the author's educational writing life.</p>
<p>This autobiographical work narrates 35 years of educational life, reflects on the society, reveals the truth, and provides an objective historical description of the development of new education in China. We should not regard it as a personal autobiography. The author's understanding of life, which embodies a kind of "unlimited self-awareness and creation," is especially worth experiencing. If you have read boring educational historical materials and other books and want to find a novel, interesting, and valuable modern educational history book, I am very willing to recommend this book.</p>
<h3>Children of the New Era</h3>
<p>Ping</p>
<p>Arnold Gesell, Francis L. Ilg and Others: Infant and Child in the Culture of Today. New York The Macmillan Macmillan Coillan Co, pp 399, 1943, 14.00</p>
<p>This book uses a popular and clear text to describe the psychological development of children from birth to the age of five. The book is accompanied by 65 pictures to illustrate the process of behavioral development in the first five years of life. The authors divide this process into twelve stages. Each stage has a chart showing its characteristics and development trends, which makes it easy to understand. The chart is based on the professional facts obtained from measurement results and provides many practical guidelines for people who look after children. Behind each chart is a "Behavior of the Day" section, which details how to take care of the child's sleep, diet, excretion, etc. at this stage.</p>
<p>These twelve charts of behavioral development, when we read them in order, show that the publication of human beings is a continuous series. This explanation can greatly help us to actually manage children. At the same time, it can enable us to obtain a more important conclusion - that is, the special defense of a child's early development can enable us to see the tendency of his life. The authors advocate that family affairs are a kind of cultural work. If we manage him according to each child's own characteristics and needs, we can cultivate a democratic lifestyle. The family is the base for the development of each person's personality. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the development of children in the first year. After 18 months, the child's behavior develops outward and exceeds the boundaries of the family. At this time, the child may have to be sent to a nursery. Therefore, the authors discuss the various aspects of nurseries in detail here.</p>
<p>The book ends with an appendix listing the toys that children at each stage may play with, and giving child guidance workers many books, notes, and materials on how to guide brothers and sisters. This book is the compass for cultivating children in the new era, and it makes a great contribution to mothers and nurses in nurseries.</p>
<h3>Nanyang and Northwest</h3>
<p>Wang Chengzhu</p>
<p>(Published in the third year by Zhengzhong Book Company and other distributors. Northwestern Regional Geography was first published in Chongqing by the Commercial Press in the 34th year and published in Shanghai in the 35th year.) Therefore, the writing styles of the two books are naturally similar. The collection of various geographical data on Nanyang and the Northwest is quite rich, so it is very convenient for general reference. At the end of the Northwest book, there is also a detailed bibliography. The whole book adopts a regional narrative, and the categories described in each region are roughly the same. Therefore, it is especially suitable for the use of classification and reading.</p>
<p>The Northwest is an important part of our country's frontier, and Nanyang is a region of increasing reproduction, which are of vital importance to us. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the various situations in these areas. The situation in these two areas is still in motion after the war. Some of what is described in the book has inevitably become outdated. However, this is not a problem, because major political changes are usually easy to pay attention to. As for economic changes, the future trend is difficult to stabilize for a while. We can only use the previous materials as a basis for comparative research. Due to the difficulty of printing, the illustrations could not be reproduced and printed, which is a pity. However, in the geographical works of zoning, the boundary demarcation of zoning is an indispensable reference basis.隙 Jun in Nanyang Geography has detailed zoning maps for several districts in Nanyang, which is very convenient. However, readers should use more detailed maps, especially topographic maps, to refer to them carefully in order to understand the true meaning of zoning. In the Northwest book, in addition to the general map of zoning, although many parts of the book use a more detailed division within each district, there is no map to show it, which is a defect.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because the authors wanted to avoid the general readers feeling bored, so the two books are very brief in their description of the root of the division. At the same time, the academic discussion and conclusion on the zoning characteristics of various geographical landscapes and their causes are only occasionally seen. However, for general readers, if you just want to check the various situations in the valley.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the two regions of Rain Wood, one is Nanyang Geography, and the other is Northwestern Regional Geography, both of which are works by Mr. Chen Zhengxiang of Central University. (According to the postscript of the Nanyang Geography book, it was completed at the end of 1990, but the first edition that was exempted from publication was quite extensive. The Nanyang book has a few place names and academic terms. It is probably inconvenient for readers who are not sincere.)</p>
<p>There is a lot of interesting material in the book. For example, regarding the production of Yige in the Philippines, it is surprising that the quality of the lower reaches of the Caga Valley (this article does not use the name Mis, which is an example) near the sea is not as good as that in the middle of the valley, because the tobacco will reduce its fragrance and irritation because it is blown by the sea breeze. Regarding the grassland area south of Dagemo, Pan Cui is making progress, but it is inevitable that it will be in vain over time, and instead, it will be greeted by stricter animal management. These are all important issues in land use. The Northwestern book pays attention to the valley area development plan, and all those who are concerned about the development of the Northwest should be interested in it.</p>
<p>Some of the information seems to be slightly problematic. For example, in the Nanyang book, the organization of the Malay states is explained very briefly, and the average reader may not be able to understand the difference in their political status. Regarding the sugarcane in Java, the vicissitudes of the past ten years or so seem to be ignored. The unit of the same kind of material is either in metric tons or in metric dan, which is not uniform, and I am afraid that it is easy for readers to misunderstand, and the cited numbers seem to be slightly doubtful. It is too negligent to not mention the British territories in the South Seas Islands.</p>
<p>In the Northwestern book, the information on natural geography is more abundant. This is obviously due to the fact that the investigation by experts from various countries has always been more focused on the natural aspects, while the information on the human aspects is inevitably scattered, or focused on the same part. However, there are also many interesting issues, such as the historical climate change in the Daoyi area, or the loss of the Tashumu River waterway and its impact. The average person thinks that the situation in the Northwest is so simple that there is not much to say, but this book can be regarded as a good counter-evidence.</p>
<h3>Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Educational Thought</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Author: Zhang Zhizhi</p>
<p>Published by Zhengxiao Book Company</p>
<p>Our country is caught in a maze of complex educational trends, and is in a state of bewilderment and frustration. To save our country's current educational crisis, we should sincerely establish an educational philosophy that adapts to our country's national policy - how to extract a constructive educational ideological system from our country's national spirit. China takes the Three People's Principles as the highest principle for building the country, so we should have an educational theory that conforms to this highest principle as a cornerstone for building a new China.</p>
<p>This article introduces the book "Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Educational Thought" written by Zhang Zhizhi. This book is a part of the educational part extracted from Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's ideological system. Although the entire book is only 88 pages, it fully develops the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought. It is indeed a compass for those of us who are responsible for violating the country's mission, studying educational thought, and engaging in educational work. Therefore, the content is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The reason for the failure of modern Chinese education - the lack of a consistent central policy in education, the lack of a consistent education system, and the incompatibility with our country's political, economic, and social background: these are the crux of the failure of the implementation of new education. Our country has suffered from the coercion of the great powers in the past and has learned a painful lesson; only then did we realize that education must be changed. Therefore, there are various kinds of "local education" and "national defense education," which are numerous and varied. Because there is no consistent central policy, there is no consistent education system. As a result, educational laws and regulations change in the morning and evening, and educational forms change in the morning and evening, which is extremely chaotic. At the same time, since we have admitted that politics, economy, society, and education have a deep relationship, then we can deduce that: the goal of education is the goal of politics; the central idea of education is also the central idea of politics. Since the realization of the Three People's Principles has been set by the National Father as the political goal of our country, we cannot study Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought without studying our country's educational goal.</p>
<p>2.  The basic spirit of the Three People's Principles - In terms of nationalism in Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought: Patriotic education must fully perceive the mission entrusted to it by the nation - Extending our country's inherent culture; at the same time, it must strengthen its common sense of identity, unite the power of the nation, and restore its national status. Of course, the first task of national education is to cultivate the national spirit, preserve and promote our country's inherent culture and general morality; then strengthen its common consciousness, unite its national power, and ultimately achieve the restoration of national status. In terms of democracy: it is advocated that education should be aimed at the whole people, not at the class; popular education must be promoted to realize the ideal of equal educational opportunities; and the will to fight for democracy and the knowledge and ability to exercise and use the right to vote must be cultivated. In terms of people's livelihood: it is advocated that education should first understand the process of industrial evolution. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen said; "People's livelihood is the center of social evolution; social evolution is the center of history." The meaning of this sentence should be thoroughly understood and universally promoted today. Secondly, we should understand the elements of human life: that is, the research on the production and consumption of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other aspects. Thirdly, we know that the ultimate goal of human consumption is still production: and people's livelihood education is a kind of production education, which should of course pay attention to the cultivation of all-round knowledge and ability, and the knowledge and ability to make a living are important tools for making a living, so it is also the biggest goal of education.</p>
<p>3.  The theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy - We want to make everyone serve as the purpose, then the two aspects of "knowing" and "doing" of the activity of serving must be discussed. From this, we can see that Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is not only a kind of psychological construction, but also a kind of educational construction. The achievement of the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is modern. There are two differences between modern and ancient times: (1) Modern times are the world of science (2) Modern times are the era of human association. Therefore, the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy can also be called "scientific" or "social". We call it scientific because it has scientific basis in psychology and physiology. At the same time, the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is social, because it also has sociological basis. "Because knowing is difficult but doing is easy, everyone should do it and publicize it all the time, because doing comes before knowing, everyone should seek knowledge in practice. This educational theory coincides with the experimental educational theory of Dr. 社威博 (J. Dewey). Dr. Dewey wants us to "learn from practice," which is exactly the methodology of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought.</p>
<p>In short, the educational theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is a "pragmatic educational theory". The pragmatic educational theory takes "doing" as the beginning and "doing" as the end of the educational process. The epistemology of pragmatism is also the instrumentalism of knowledge: it is believed that "knowing" is only a tool of "doing". At the same time, the educational theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy or pragmatism, on the one hand, it is to encourage people to explore the truth in actual life based on their natural abilities and use rich truth to enrich the content of actual life. On the other hand, it is also necessary to use the function of will to lay the foundation for action; so that the action will not be interrupted and reach the ultimate goal. This is what Dr. Sun Yat-Sen said: "Those who have aspirations will succeed."</p>
<h3>Write Something for the Children</h3>
<p>Zhu Li</p>
<p>By the alley, at the corner of the vegetable market, you often see a group of children surrounding a book stall, reading with great interest. What are they reading? Some are precocious erotic stories, some are adult life stories, some are stories of knights and immortals.... These books have vulgar words and crude pictures. Friends of Open Education see this and feel that "this is a problem of children's education". How will these low-level, bizarre, and chaotic readings affect the innocent children? -- They are absorbing things that they should not and cannot understand in the development of their physiology and psychology. This induces harmful precocity in them, and when they are not clear about what is right and wrong in the current situation, they are asked to vaguely absorb some right and wrong things. Therefore, some children want to learn to be immortals, some children hope to be heroes who use flying swords every day, and some children want to be majestic emperors. How are these readings with words and pictures carrying out their sexual education!</p>
<p>We cannot prohibit children from reading these harmful readings. At the same time, these readings still have their uses for a certain class of society: "Killing time when bored". Then, what should we do? -- We hope that friends who care about children's education and children's culture will really do something for the children and compile some readings for the children. Naturally, these readings should focus on the meaning of education, but cannot lack literary interest. We hope to produce some children's psychology-friendly and interesting words and picture books. Comic books are a good form. In today's very depressed publishing industry, whether publishers dare to try is certainly a problem, but we must know that the number of child readers will not be less than the young people and adults who love new literature.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on "Spring in Beiwang Garden"</h3>
<p>Zheng Jia Huan</p>
<p>In early spring this year, the third issue of the Universe magazine published a short story that was quite "not short"! The title is "Spring in Beiwang Garden", and the author is "Lu Binji"! This word is very unfamiliar to me; but this work of his has left a very good impression: there is a unique writing style, fluent, slow, and full of intimacy when reading.</p>
<p>After that, I mentioned it to a few friends. Besides knowing that Lu Binji is a new young writer in the rear, we also had different views on that short story; some people thought: their style is very outstanding, but it is a pity that the depiction of small details is too focused on the protagonist, which is unavoidable; others said: although he can give us a novel feeling in this novel, if he continues to write according to the old format, this is very difficult for the author himself. My friends may all be as superficial as I am when appreciating literary works! He added criticism based on his own feelings and prejudices, and only paid attention to the achievements in skills, neglecting the content; such an absolutely unobjective attitude, the review can be rewarded, however, in fact, we all prefer this story.</p>
<p>Three months later, I accidentally discovered a small square book on the newsstand. On the white cover, there was a green pattern, and the words "Spring in Beiwang Garden" were written in bright red letters. This is Lu Binji's collection of short novels! I was so happy, I hurried to buy it back and read it all night; only then did I realize that Lu Binji is not the gentle and beautiful author that we imagined. He can also use straightforward and stubborn writing to write some painful and ugly stories, which are shocking:</p>
<p>The short novel collection "Spring in Bei Guan" has about 80,000 words and contains ten stories; (1) The meaning of life; (2) Children of peasant families; (3) Neighbors - Kang Tiangang, (4) Spring in Bei Yuan; (5) The story of red glass; (6) The story of old men, (7) The incident in 1944; (8) A frank man's confession; (9) The old maid; (10) He Huojie's house.</p>
<p>Among them, "Children of Peasant Families", "Neighbors - He Quangang" and "The Story of Red Glass" are all based on the border area between Guandong, Russia and Korea, so the local color is very strong. This is rarely seen in ordinary works; perhaps the author himself grew up there since childhood, and has a clear and deep understanding of the customs, lifestyles, and generational tragedies of that place, so it is particularly vivid to write.</p>
<p>In addition, the background of the remaining seven stories is to describe the anecdotes of many small people in the rear towns during the Anti-Japanese War; during that difficult and painful period, people were confined in a small cage, without joy, living in boredom, and then silently depressed! They spent their days in "disputes" and "hatred," enduring confusion, sighs, and anger; their spirits suffered incurable numbness and disability; and some people died like this because they could not bear the pressure! The masters in "Spring in Bei Yuan" could not find some clear periods, warmth, and "spring" full of floral fragrance!</p>
<p>In Lu Binji's novels, there are no tortuous legends, no "preaching tone", no "new literary tone", no "strong gunpowder smell", no "great love", and no "roses". What he presents are all ordinary things, the most real dynamics of life; containing a faint sadness and misfortune. Sometimes, he is also willing to make the atmosphere in the story very quiet and beautiful, but under these bright things, disappointment and sorrow are revealed even more cruelly.... The protagonists in those stories may be the friends you have seen around you, or one of them may be your own shadow; in the past, you may have been worried about yourself and washed away your tears, but now, the sky in your heart has gradually become darker, their tired and haggard figures have become blurred, only their stumbling steps are slowly stepping on your heart...</p>
<p>Lu Binji has a very unique and tactful writing style. We can see one or two from the following short paragraph: "...Today is July 1st, what should the summer in Beiwang Garden, Guilin be like? Is Lin Meina still digging for earthworms? If her difficulty has grown up, then what is she doing in the afternoon when she is sleeping? She never reads books or magazines, so isn't there a blank in her life? Will she feel empty during this blank period...? In fact, the male and female guests in Beiwang Garden will not be lonely when they are carefree. They will also sit on the corridor and make pure sounds - in the living room of the red tile house, the flowers of the puli flower in the vase must not be small for their happiness, and there may also be Zhu Qiuhua palms! I miss Beiwang Gang, I miss the late night in Beiwang Garden... Zhao Renjie must still be sitting in his dark room, imagining... Now there should be a piece of frog noise in the late night in Beiwang Garden."</p>
<p>Spring has already passed, do you miss it? Why not lower your head and look at "Spring in Beiwang Garden"! It may bring you some news! Let you think for a moment in the quiet poem.</p>

<p>Hauptmann Died in Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>According to reports, the great German playwright Hauptmann passed away in his hometown of Silesia in mid-June. He was born in 1862 and died at the age of eighty-five.</p>
<p>Hauptmann's plays do not seem to have been staged in our country, and there do not seem to be any adapted translations. However, in the early days of the New Literature Movement, there were many introductions to Hauptmann's plays.</p>
<p>I remember that there were two translations by Yang Bingchen in the World Series of the Commercial Press, one was "The Beaver Coat" and the other was "The Sunken Bell". Later, Chen Jiakai translated "The Weavers", which has long been out of print by the Commercial Press. The "Lonely People" translated by Miao Guoren was also published by the Commercial Press. "The Sunken Bell" translated by Sun Pu was published by Kaiming. This is his representative work combining symbolism and naturalism. Almost every country has a translation. One of the earliest literary groups in our country even used "The Sunken Bell" as the name of the society. Lin Ruji, Chen Wu, Feng Zhi and others were all members of the society. In terms of novels, there is also "The Heretic of Sanara" translated by Wang Shiwei, published by Zhonghua; "The Heretic" translated by Guo Moruo is another translation of this novel.</p>
<p>There are no special books on Hauptmann's research in our country, but there are four articles cited in the sixth issue of the thirteenth volume of the Novel Monthly. If they are printed in a single volume, they can also become a small book of nearly 30,000 words. These four articles are "Biography of Hauptmann", "Naturalistic Works of Hauptmann", "Symbolistic Works of Hauptmann" and "Hauptmann and Nietzsche's Philosophy". Xizhen Huo is probably the pseudonym of Shen Yanbing (Mao Dun). Liu Dajie's "Outline of German Literature" (Beixin) also has a detailed introduction to Hauptmann. The Hauptmann part in "Modern World Writers on Nobel Prize Money Winners" (Han Jiao Zhengkai Printing House) by Ms. Yang Jikan (seemingly Yang Jiang) is based on Liu's book. A book similar to Yang Shan's is "Nobel Prize in Literature" by Lv Shi Xiao, which also has Hauptmann's chapter. In addition, what can be provided to us for reference are Jin Xiangsen's three works: "History of German Literature" (Literature Industry. Commercial Press), "Prepared German Literature" (Encyclopedia Series. Commercial Press), and "Modern German Literary Trends" (People's Library. Huatong). Zhang Chuanpu, a graduate of German from Peking University, once wrote "Outline of the History of German Literature" (Zhonghua). Li Jinfa's "German Literature ABC" also translated a section of "The Weavers". Jiang Qifan's "Modern Writers" and Sun Lianggong's "Biographies of World Writers" also have Hauptmann's outline. The list of these book names can not only be used for the study of Hauptmann, but also for literary enthusiasts who do not understand Western languages to study German literature.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Hauptmann's earliest play "Before Sunrise" has never been translated. I wonder if there were any translations in the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. There are not many English reference books at hand. Roberson's "German Literature" (Family University Books) said: "The sign of the most promising new life can be found in Berlin, which is the Independent Theater, which was established in imitation of the French Free Theater. This theater began in 1888, and the first play was Ibsen's "Ghosts", which was considered the most powerful play of the era by young revolutionaries in the 1980s; after "Ghosts" was the first work of German writer Hauptmann, "Before Sunrise". ...It is not easy to make a conclusion about Hauptmann. The difficulty lies in his tendency to change constantly. He has tried various literary forms, especially drama, more than any writer of the same era. He is easily influenced by others. He is influenced on the one hand, but he also has a strong personality, which is contradictory. For example, he initially wrote very realistic dramas, and later he and his contemporaries were influenced by the Scandinavians, and the result was "The Weavers", the most powerful drama of the first period of the literary revival. Later, when the new mysticism swept through Europe, almost uprooting realism, Hauptmann was fascinated by the new mysticism. In "Hannele's Ascension", he created a new fairy tale drama, combining realism and fantasy, written very delicately. "The Sunken Bell" is almost a allegorical poem. What returned to a more solid realistic basis was "Teamster Henlier" and "Rosenband". Hauptmann walked his own way, often evading the critics' wishes. He lived sharply in the trend of thought, but, to be honest, he was not as successful as his previous works. It is doubtful whether Hauptmann's recent plays can leave some traces in the history of German drama. In his later years, he turned to novels. His strange new world's first story, "The Madman in Kuinte Monastery", is undeniably full of imagination."</p>
<p>Roberson's words seem to be fair. But Thomas's "History of German Literature" (One Yuan Belt Books) is inevitably biased. Thomas seems to be in the same boat as the Restorationists. But because he took the opportunity to introduce the situation of "Before Sunrise", it is also translated below:</p>
<p>"It is generally acknowledged that the important representative of German naturalism is Hauptmann, who is the debater of the new creed. However, his debate is not very perfect. He has no abstract lessons, no artistic skills, but pathological</p>
<h3>US Nationwide Launch of Boycott Movement</h3>
<p>Price Control Bill Vetoed by House of Representatives</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] Following the termination of price controls on July 1st, the first nationwide anti-inflation movement occurred today. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), called on its 800,000 members to stage a two-hour work stoppage, with demonstrations scheduled for the latter half of this week or next week. Furthermore, citizen committees and consumer conferences in several cities have scheduled a one-day boycott.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The House of Representatives tonight, by a vote of 211 to 64, rejected the price control bill passed by the Senate, deeming it weak and ineffective. The bill has now been referred to a joint Senate-House committee to draft a compromise measure for presidential signature and implementation. The House's action represents a preliminary victory for the government.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Plea: The World Should Promptly Take Action to Achieve International Control of Atomic Energy; UN Committee Drafts Concrete Plan; Evatt Vehemently Opposes Abuse of Veto Power</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] US Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace, in an address at the opening ceremony of the Society for World Control of Atomic Energy today, stated that only world control of atomic energy could promote world recovery and security. Wallace urged immediate action to facilitate international control of atomic energy. He stated that while another war similar to the last world war might not annihilate humanity, a world war involving atomic weapons would likely lead to humanity's destruction.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 16th] The Atomic Energy Control Plan Drafting Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow to begin drafting a control plan, disregarding the Soviet Union's insistence that control measures should not be established until atomic bombs are banned. Tomorrow's meeting will mark a new phase in the Atomic Energy Commission's mission, combining US, Soviet, and Australian proposals to draft a concrete plan.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 16th] Australian Foreign Minister Herbert Evatt, who has served as Chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission for a month, will soon travel to Paris to attend the peace conference. He broadcasted here, criticizing the use of veto power in the Security Council. It is said that he will lead the effort to raise this issue at the UN General Assembly in September, hoping that all countries will discuss it thoroughly so that the veto power will never be abused in the future.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 16th] In the basement of a department store here, there is a marriage agency that charges 300 yen for a wedding. If the introduction is unsuccessful, a divorce can be obtained in five minutes, which attracts a wide clientele. Weddings are conducted in a group format, providing a ceremonial hall, wedding attire, three wedding photos, and a "feast," offering each new couple a cup of sake and the attendants three cups of wine. At the same time, the Japanese government will establish marriage guidance centers in various cities to teach "husband-pampering techniques" and general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Mihailović and Eight Others Secretly Executed Yesterday; US and UK Indicate They Do Not Intend to Continue Interfering; Sympathizers of Mihailović Also Arrested in Large Numbers</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 17th broadcast: Former Yugoslav guerrilla leader Draža Mihailović and eight of his accomplices were executed by firing squad in a secret military ceremony at dawn this morning. The secret execution took place at a location twelve kilometers outside Belgrade, with only a judge, a doctor, a priest, and the executioner present.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 16th] A State Department spokesperson stated that the US government would not intervene in the death sentence of former Yugoslav guerrilla leader General Mihailović. Former Yugoslav Ambassador to the US, Fotić, was also sentenced in absentia to twenty years of imprisonment. He is currently in the United States, and the Yugoslav government has not requested his extradition. According to the extradition treaty signed between the US and Yugoslavia in 1921, extradition is limited to ordinary criminal offenders, and political offenders are not included.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 16th] Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin stated in the House of Commons today that the UK does not intend to continue interfering in the case of Yugoslav guerrilla leader Mihailović. The British government has handed over the credentials of five British liaison officers to the Yugoslav government, proving that Mihailović had actively resisted the enemy, but these credentials were not submitted to the Belgrade military court.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 16th] The Italian news agency ANSA reported from Sofia that Bulgarian police have arrested a large number of Serbians sympathetic to Mihailović in Petrelik, southwestern Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>Arrested Jews Stage Mass Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 17th broadcast: The situation in Palestine is becoming increasingly complex. Thousands of arrested Jews resumed their hunger strike today.</p>
<h3>Mihailović's Nerves Were Abnormal Before Execution</h3>
<p>Smoking Four Hundred Cigarettes a Day</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 16th] On the night of the 15th, Mihailović told the soldiers guarding him that the most difficult time would be the fifteen minutes before the execution. It is reported that he was in an abnormal state of mind, smoking as many as four hundred cigarettes a day. Before the sentence was announced, he always thought that he would only be sentenced to life imprisonment at most, but he did not expect to receive the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Byrnes's Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>I confess that before the meeting in April I had little hope of an agreement being reached; after the April meeting, I had even less hope. At present, the prospects for the five countries to conclude peace treaties are bright. Ninety days after the ratification of these treaties, the occupying forces must withdraw, except for those protecting transportation lines. At that time, the people of the occupied countries will be able to breathe the air of freedom and live the life of free people. We are now returning to the path of peace, and I do not want to hide from the American people the disputes and difficulties that the four governments have encountered in harmonizing their opinions on these treaties. If we and our allies acknowledge the fundamental differences in our concepts, standards, and methods, we will ultimately have a better chance of solving our problems.</p>
<p>German and Austrian Issues: Although this conference made genuine progress on the peace issues of Italy and its satellite countries, it made no progress on the issues of Germany and Austria. Perhaps the time spent on the discussion was not in vain, because our experience has proven that our understanding with our Soviet friends cannot be achieved overnight. We must go through a series of debates, repeat our positions, and reaffirm our stance. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union finds it difficult to understand us, just as we find it difficult to understand the Soviet Union; but sometimes I think that our Soviet friends are deeply afraid that if they agree to everything we need without arguing, we will see them as weak, so they have to deliberately obstruct us. However, constant disputes are not conducive to a world that hopes for lasting peace. The Soviet Union began discussing the German issue with a pre-prepared statement. Our proposed draft treaty was to guarantee the continued disarmament of Germany for at least 25 years, but the Soviet statement insisted on opposing a treaty guaranteeing Germany's non-aggression against the Soviet Union and the security of Europe. I do not think the Soviet Union can understand the suspicion that its cold and hostile attitude has caused in the minds of friendly countries. The US's proposal to jointly guarantee the continued disarmament of Germany was a sincere suggestion to address the Soviet Union's concerns about security. If the US had been a party to this guarantee after World War I, World War II would not have occurred, and the Soviet Union would not have been attacked and ravaged. How could German militarism be used as a pawn in the struggle between East and West? How could German militarism be allowed to gain the opportunity to defeat its enemies one by one again? The Soviet side claimed that our proposed treaty was inappropriate and could not guarantee the elimination of German Nazism and the promotion of democracy, nor could it guarantee compensation to the Soviet Union; but these are all political issues that have already been discussed in the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
<p>Military Agreements: The military agreement we concluded on June 5, 1946, stipulated the immediate disarmament of the German army and the destruction of its war factories' military capabilities. Our proposed 25-year treaty was intended to ensure that once Germany was disarmed, we would ensure that it would not rearm. We do not understand why the Soviet Union opposes it? Especially since Marshal Stalin had already expressed his agreement in principle on this matter on December 24th last year.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative said that he had received reports that the disarmament work in the British occupation zone had not been implemented. The British representative said that according to reports, German factories in the Soviet occupation zone were still operating. We requested the Control Council to investigate these reports and verify them. The British and French representatives agreed to this approach, but the Soviet side did not agree to the investigation unless the investigation was limited to disarmament. I did point out at the beginning of the Paris Conference that the disarmament of Germany was only one part of the work to solve the German problem. At that time, I suggested, and at the most recent meeting I suggested again, that each country appoint representatives to promote the work of solving all the problems related to Germany. The British and French governments agreed to this suggestion, but the Soviet Union opposed it. The Soviet Union suggested that a special conference should be convened to discuss the German issue, and I expressed my agreement to it and insisted on confirming the date of this conference. However, based on my experience with the Italian and Balkan issues, I am deeply afraid that if the Soviet Union does not send representatives to maintain close contact with the foreign ministers and devote themselves to studying the points of agreement and disagreement, then the foreign ministers' exchange of fragmented opinions on the German issue will still be insufficient. We no longer need to hide the fact that, from the military point of view of each power, the four-power zoning control of Germany is not a perfect solution.</p>
<p>Economic Aspects: According to the Potsdam Declaration, in economic terms, Germany should be a whole, and we should establish a central management department to achieve this goal. However, in reality, Germany has been divided into four regions, and the movement, trade, and ideas between the people of each region have been strictly restricted, which is even more severe than between independent countries. As a result, each region has difficulty being self-sufficient, and we are spending $200 million a year in the US-occupied area. Although we and other occupying countries have undertaken a heavy financial burden, Germany is still threatened by inflation and economic paralysis. This situation will not continue. At the Paris Conference, we suggested instructing the Control Council to establish a central administrative agency to manage Germany as an economic unit and to prepare a plan for the exchange of products and the balance of imports and exports in each region. The French government, which had previously opposed the establishment of a central administrative agency, expressed its willingness to accept our suggestion. The UK also expressed its agreement, but the Soviet Union said that it could not agree to exclude the Saar region, so it could not proceed. I stated that we were unwilling to share responsibility for the economic paralysis of Germany and the inevitable suffering that would result from it, so I announced the final solution: we are prepared to manage our occupied area as an economic unit.</p>
<p>US Suggestions: I have explained that we have recently obtained cooperation from the British and Soviet occupied areas on some issues. I explained that our suggestion was not to divide Germany, but to make it one. I said: Any agreement made with one government can be joined by other governments under the same conditions if they are prepared to participate. The UK said that they would consider our suggestion and expressed the hope that they could agree to it; but the Soviet Union and France did not express their opinions. Our military representatives in Germany will receive instructions this week to cooperate with any one or all of the three governments on various important administrative matters, such as finance, transportation, communication, trade, and industry. Finally, we discussed the Austrian issue. On June 1, I issued a draft treaty recognizing Austria's independence and stipulating the withdrawal of the occupying forces. The British side submitted the draft for discussion, and I requested the appointment of representatives from the foreign ministers to draft the treaty. The Soviet side put forward two counter-proposals: (1) Take further action to ensure the complete elimination of Austrian Nazism. (2) Withdraw a large number of homeless refugees from the border, who are said to be very unfriendly to the Soviet Union. The UK and France were willing to take consistent action with us to submit the treaty to the representatives of the foreign ministers for consideration, and requested the Management Committee to conduct an investigation on the elimination of Nazism and the refugee issues and report on its progress; but the Soviet representative was unwilling to agree to the representatives drafting the Austrian peace treaty before there was any practical action on these two issues.</p>
<p>Austrian Refugees: We recognize the seriousness of this issue and are trying our best to solve it, especially the refugee issue. With the consent of the refugees, we help them return to their home country; but many people refuse to return to their home country because they are deeply afraid that political differences will lead to their death or imprisonment.</p>
<p>Our tradition of protecting political prisoners is very valuable, and we cannot agree to collectively expel these Chinese people from our region. The United Nations has a special committee studying this issue, and we will continue to work hard to find a solution; but this solution should not be a cruel solution that causes the American people to no longer be trusted. Delaying the signing of a peace treaty with Austria will lead to tragic results, because Austria is a temporary residence for political exiles until they can find a place to settle in other countries. We should adhere to our position at the conference, so that the war-stricken world can return to peace, and let the soldiers overseas return to their homeland and families, and turn swords into plowshares. The war has left the world scarred, and we must heal these wounds. We do not trust peace based on revenge. We believe in justice, generosity, and compassion. If we treat others with generosity and compassion, our enemies will become our friends. We should follow the path of peace and implore the great God to have mercy and grant peace to the world.</p>

<h3>Eradicate Opium and Narcotics; Encourage Citizens to Report</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The city police department has always strictly enforced laws and regulations in investigating and prohibiting opium and narcotics. After the expiration of the self-renewal registration period for opium addicts in April, in addition to supervising the sub-bureaus to conduct strict investigations and seizures, it also encourages citizens to report in various ways in order to eradicate them as soon as possible. If the citizens of this city are sure of the places where opium and narcotics are sold, manufactured, or hidden, and those who smoke opium and narcotics, they can report them to the police department or sub-bureaus in writing. The informant only needs to write down their address and name, and does not need to provide a guarantee, but must not make false accusations out of malice.</p>
