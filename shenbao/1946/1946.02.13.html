<h3>主席今日舉行招待會　撫慰濶別八載父老　昨與魏德邁商談甚久</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席前日下午蒞滬後，全市民衆莫不歡欣若狂，昨仍繼續懸旗致敬，主席為體察市民衷苦，已於祁齊路成立行轅秘書處，接受各界公函及陳訴函件，並定今日上午在市府大禮堂招待中外各報社記者及蒙難同志代表，下午主席夫婦將在台接斯脫路舉行與北平懷仁堂性質相同之招待會，撫慰業已闊別八載之本市父老。</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時　主席夫婦同乘汽車由官邸逕赴虹橋路萬國公墓，拜掃宋太夫人墓，主席御藍袍黑掛，外披黑呢大　，夫人着類色海虎絨大衣，軍務局長兪濟時同車，坐於前座’錢大鈞·張道藩及侍從副官等，則分乘汽車四輛，隨行於後，車抵公墓，主席夫婦步出車廂，行至宋太夫人墓前恭立，由黃仁霖呈獻花圈後，恭行三鞠躬禮，徘徊謁吊約二十分鐘，始登車返邸。十一時五十分，駐華美軍總司令魏德邁將軍偕秘書伍漢民晋謁　主席，對中國地區內之軍事問題作重要會談，　主席夫婦並留魏氏在官邸午膳，直至下午三時三十三分，魏氏始偕秘書辭出。據張主委道藩語記者，魏氏謁見　主席，係商洽關於軍事方面之各項問題。</p>
<p>晚七時半，魏德邁將軍及美駐華海軍總司令柯克將軍，特假華懋飯店設宴，為　主席婦洗塵，並表歡迎之意。應邀參加盛宴者，尙有陳誠夫婦，錢大鈞，周至柔，張道藩，沈士華，黃仁霖，兪濟時，沈昌煥等。　主席夫婦於八時正駕臨，魏將軍特派其聯絡官麥特少校至大門恭迎，美憲　兵列隊肅立致敬，　主席衣大體服，夫人衣黑色長旗袍，外着皮大衣，均笑容滿面，至十樓後，魏將軍特趨前與　主席夫婦熱烈握手，會中　主盡歡，至十時始散。昨晚美方出席作陪者，有駐滬總領事喬雪令，美軍總部參謀長梅白克，副參謀長凱樂惠等各高級將領。</p>
<p>滬各界盛大歡迎會明日在跑馬廳舉行</p>
<p>本市各界自獲悉主席蒞臨後，已籌備舉行一空前盛大之歡迎大會，定於十四日下午三時在跑馬廳塲地舉行，全市黨政軍學生工人曁民衆團體均可自由參加，俾全市人民對尊敬崇愛之最高領袖皆得一睹丰采，並聆訓示。參加團體約於今日先行至社會局登記，以便籌備會排列會排列會塲內次序，隨大會預定參加人數為十萬人，於下午一時入塲集會，其出入門，將臨時開關（一）西藏路口大門，（二）跑馬　路龍門路口大門，（三）新世界口大門，參加大會之留滬中委，國民參政員，黨政軍各機關首長，明軍將校，地方耆紳，則於下午二時由南京中路馬霍路轉角之大門入塲參加。　主席准於下午三時到會，將不行儀式，即恭請　主席訓話。　主席夫婦為慰勞盟軍，定十四日下午八時假美琪大戲院舉行游藝晚會，將由梅關芳演崑曲「費貞娥刺虎」，此外，尙有杜月笙夫人及邵章雲合演之「四郎探母」，林構森。和少餘合演之「戰長沙」，紀玉良·言意珠之戲目尙未定。</p>
<h3>新一軍已自粵誘啓程　經九龍開往東北　蘇駐軍何時撤退尙無確期</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港十二日電〕今日此間透露：中國新一軍已於昨日開始自廣東經九龍開往東北。新一軍之啓程，以及馬歇爾將軍與周恩來可能於本週內抵達廣東，使人更信廣東境內之戰事，事實上已告結束。新一軍自去年十一月以來即駐廣東，等候美國運輸艦前往日本，參加監軍之佔領本州。此項計劃後經取消，該軍即規定開往東北。</p>
<p>不予更多讓步不能接收東北</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十二日電〕甫自東北返渝之中國某高級官吏，今日表示意見，認為蘇方雖在表面上似正協助中國，但中國如不予蘇方以更多之讓步，恐不能接收東北。</p>
<p>經濟讓步</p>
<p>當憶二月五日蔣主席接見記者待，曾承認有關中蘇條約公佈條文以外之經濟讓步，方與蘇聯進行非正式之談判中。　蔣主席招待記者會之翌日，中國某官方發言人稱：中國方面並未請蘇軍自東北撤退之期限，延至二月一日以後。</p>
<p>暗殺事件</p>
<p>該返渝之中國官吏稱：長春與哈爾濱之中國人，於下午五時，即受宵禁限制，設走出兩通衢之外，個人之安全即無保障，暗殺事件仍時有發生。該數城內之中國報紙，亦時有暗殺之報這。官方之中央社於二月九日發表長春來訊稱：經濟部東北特派員張莘夫以及其他人員四人在瀋陽北撫順煤礦區遭武裝匪徒三百人以上所殺害，某中國高級官吏，指控此項匪徒，實際上係管轄撫順區之某少將所部之蘇軍。名義上獨立之「世界日報」於二月五日亦有類似之報道。據稱有七人失踪，一人逃失。「國民公報」於二月九日稱：自重慶派往東北之官吏，常遭暗殺。</p>
<p>訓練軍隊</p>
<p>該返渝之中國官吏。謂東北蘇軍已訓練及配備當地之軍隊四十萬人，一部份傀儡為共產黨，但大部份係在日木佔領時期逃往蘇聯地帶之遊擊隊，渠並稱尚有延安方面軍隊二十萬人，亦根據蘇方之命令，在日本投降後，開入東北。該官吏透露，在月五份以前不能希望蘇軍有任何撤退行動。渠稱營房及軍事設置，業已修理竣事，東北之蘇軍復員士兵，業已全部返國，而由新部隊瓜代。該官吏謂：重要重工業廠，現僅剩空屋，主要之配備及裝置已運往蘇聯。渠稱重要鐵路及其他交通工具，仍在蘇軍控制之下，有如中央社所報道者。</p>
<p>何時撤退</p>
<p>據悉外交部長王世杰曾兩度邀請蘇大使彼得羅夫至其辦公處討論蘇軍於何時開始撤退，蘇大使答稱，渠須致電莫斯科。最近報紙上之報道，均强調東北局勢之困難，東北外交特派員蔣經國曾數度前往東北，最近蔣夫人亦有東北之行。「和平日報」稱：國府接收東北數省之官吏，現仍駐於長春及哈爾濱，某數報紙則謂東北方面政府軍與共產軍現並無衝突。「中央日報」今日功：蔣委員長東北行營已設立一中蘇聯合軍警督察處，負責維持藩陽汝其附近地區之秩序。</p>
<p>澈查張案</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十二日電〕獨立右派之「世界日報」今日刊載社評，要求政府對上月東北特派員張莘夫被刺一案，澈查眞相，因「此案不僅爲一謀害案，且爲影響中國在東北主權之重要事件」。該社論謂此一事件使盟國令譽玷蒙汚點，且足威脅亞洲未來之和平。該報指稱：撫願位於煤礦區以內，由蘇軍駐防，除蘇軍以外，其他武裝部隊均不凖闖入，則謂張莘夫係被三百盜匪所殺害，其誰信之。該社評結論稱：中國已拒絕接受足以損害蘇聯之任何條件中國亦相信，蘇聯不故致違背其諾言，以毀損其令譽。</p>
<h3>修築川康路　列入五年建設中</h3>

<h3>軍事復員會議　月中在京召開　東南各將領被邀出席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕抗戰勝利後第一次在京舉行之軍事會議，將於最近期間揭幕，駐防東南各省及沿江各地師長以上之部隊長，大多均將來京出席。會議顯非全國性，聞中心議題除有關軍隊編整，敎育及補給外，尚須聽取出席各將領之報告，提付審查後討論之。戰後各國正競言復員裁兵，中國自不能例外，但中國復員裁兵之難題堪稱獨外，今日京中人士咸信，此項會議將着重軍事善後之討論，蔣主席次親臨主持。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕據可靠方面息，軍事當局以復員工作亟待推進，次在京召開軍事復員會議，詳加商討，日期可能為本月十五日，將由何總司令應欽主持，聞東南各省之高級將領均被邀出席，蔣主席或將蒞京主持開幕式，親致訓　。</p>

<p>太原調處在停頓中　共黨代表迄未到并</p>
<p>〔聯合社太原十一日電〕山西多山，背倚黃河，有全中國最富煤鐵鑛藏，軍事調處執行部將在其地遭逢嚴重試騐，蓋停戰及恢復交通令在該省迄在微妙的停頓狀態中。山西全境現有敵對軍隊四十餘萬，內計中央軍一師，閻錫山部下正規軍二十六萬人，日軍四萬人，及確數不詳之共產軍，大的在十萬人以上，雖未發生大規模戰事，但軍隊之調動，時有所聞。據治晉逾三十五年之閻錫山稱，停戰令有百分之八十希望，可以順利執行，他人則較為悲觀。執行部自北平遣來此間之三人小組，已到美國方面之霍來上校及中央方面之周少將，但共黨代表以策略或其他理由，尚未指派，記者目睹二人一籌莫展。霍來係於本月三日由大同抵此，在大同霍來小組曾於六日中成立廣泛調處協定，因此獲馬歇爾特使褒獎，謂其「在非常困難靑形　達成完美工作」。此間執行小組雖　　無工作，但各方已紛紛提出控訴。據閻氏稱，自一月十三日停戰令宣布後，又被共軍佔去地域四縣以上。在山西一百〇六縣中，在共軍手中者有三十九縣。日本第一軍司令角田曾坦直承認，自戰事告終後，其部下曾與共軍作無數次接觸，一月十三日後死日兵三人，傷六人，被俘十二人。小組尚接得報告，謂太原大同二城糧食俱遭封鎖，記者在太原未覺食糧匱乏，所傳城中存糧僅足二十三萬居民四日之用，由貨物充斥之店舖觀之，不足憑信，店中甚至可買到美國貨咖啡，雖則價格極高，每磅需法幣六千元。在閻錫山統轄下各大城市，驢車及駱駝隊准許轍送供應品至城外，似確係事實，但歸來時均空無所有。電話交通雖力圖恢復，但四鄉共軍刺刀出鞘以阻挽之。大同太原間通車僅三日，傳因中間某處鐵路橋樑被焚又告中輟，此稱情事均發生於停戰令頒布及大同區調處協定成立之後。據此間小組代表觀察，在協定簽訂及實際推行之間尚有陣礙可危及整調停戰問題云。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦十二日電〕烏克蘭代表曼紐爾斯基，今日在聯合國安全理事會中聲稱：東印英駐軍馬勒貝將軍係被日方特務人員所殺，「因英軍未能在該地區解除日軍之武裝故也」。曼氏所投之炸彈式陳述，適與英外相貝文所稱被印度尼西亞極端份子所殺之說相反。按馬勒貝將軍係於去年秋初遭人暗殺。貝文外相初次向聯合國機構辯述東印問題時，曾以該案作為英軍未抵東印前暫用日軍維持秩序之藉口。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕出席聯合國機構之美代表團長史坦丁紐斯，昨夜在安全理事會聲明反對理事會派委員會赴爪哇，此為美國對印度尼西亞爭端之初次聲明。史氏發言之前，理事會對於烏克蘭代表團是否有權提出正式決議案，主派委員會實地調查一節，熱烈辯論，已歷兩小時，直至今晨，辯論印度尼西亞僵局，猶繼續進行，然理事會已決定準許烏克蘭提出建議，而澳大利與美國代表均發言力主勿派委員會。昨夜辯論時，未正式反對烏克蘭建議者僅中國代表顧維鈞。史坦丁紣斯稱：從事調查大可不必，理事會任何行動，均是妨碍巴達維亞之說著，然理事宜表示其希望日軍之投降條件，「立刻實行」，渠確信理事會希望談判成功，以「應印度尼西亞人合法之自治願望」。主席梅金代表澳大利發言謂：英軍在爪哇并不威脅和平，理事會殊無干涉之理由，但若派遣委員會，則澳大利亦欲派代表參加云。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞氏發言　聲明我國立場　并不反對派調查團</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕中國首席代表顧維鈞博士，昨於安全理事會辯論印度尼西亞問題時發表意見，聲明對於烏克蘭代表建議派遣調查團前往印度尼西亞一點，在原則上并不反對。顧氏之言有謂：吾人并非主張調查本案，惟旣有若干政府誠意希望獲得關於該地局勢之更多情報，吾人相信調查團或能有所供獻。中國代表團根據此一理由，而并非對英國缺乏信任，將不反對烏克蘭之建議。荷領東印度有華僑逾二百萬，大部份居在爪哇，自去年九月開始軍事行動以來，華人已頗有死傷，泗水一地，在過去四月中，華僑遇害者五百名，此等報告，猶非最後之報告。關於印度尼西亞之民族運動，在爪哇之華人，盡力避免牽涉，然彼等之同情，自寄與奮力爭取自治政府之一方面，中國人民，以及所有愛好和平與自由之民族，包括荷蘭人民在內，對誰印度尼西亞人民均具深刻同情，中國代表團認為此事不妨延期討論，以視印荷直接談判之結果如何而定。</p>

<p>「中國的辣斐德」，—陳納德將軍，半年前在熱烈歡送中惜別了中國，半月前又在熱烈歡迎中重遊了昆明。從其離華到返華，為時雖僅一百五十天，而在他服務了八年的國家裏，却有了不少的變化。三十四年八月八日，一個細雨霏霏的早晨，這位飛虎將軍，帶着「功在華夏」的榮譽傘，和鐫有「重慶」兩字的金鑰匙，登上了返國的專機，某記者曾於行前詢將軍曰：「此行是否再見？抑係長別？」將軍躊躇了片刻，始以極坦率的語氣答稱：「現尚不知，究將如何，惟時間將說明此事」。將軍此時心境，不難獲悉，昆市各界在機場送行者，眉宇間掛着微雨，內心像失去了一位親切的友人，彼此揮巾示別時，尤不勝依依。</p>
<h3>報童高喊　「看陳納德新聞」</h3>
<p>陳將軍再度來華的佳音，忽於元月初旬傳遍了中國，昆明人聞此訊，更有一些自私的樂觀的看法。有些人傳說，陳將軍將在昆訓練空軍，失業的人不愁沒有辦法。有些人推測，昆明的鷄蛋，也許不會大跌價。元月十八日將軍由渝抵昆，第三天，報童在街上叫喊：「看陳納德的新聞！」一般人才知道十九日晚七時，滇垣軍政界首長，在奧文銀行熱烈歡迎陳將軍。五位主人盧永衡主席，霍嵩山總司令等。</p>
<p>陳將軍在華八年，大部份的時間住在昆明。此間人士不特知道他的歷年戰果，而且熟知其私生活。聞於公忙之餘，好運動，好獵狩，有時橋戲，有時飲酒，生活簡單　作息有定時。對於個人警衛，素不重視。臥室門窗，夜不下鎖。元月二十五日午夜，學士闖入將軍臥室，幸未滋事。過去在昆時，中美警衛人員，因虞意外事件發生，乃加强室外警戒，並常密查附近居民，以防歹徒混入。</p>
<p>陳將軍現年五十六歲，從事航空工作聞已達二十餘年。二十六年來華，耳已不靈，因飛行太多所致。他待人和靄，且富同情心，將軍率空軍，始終沒有炸過上海北平的商業區與居民區。據他的老翻譯官說：他認為北平是中國的精華，應儘可能的予以保存。上海人口太多，轟炸的結果，不免有損人道。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>為外國公司釋欵</h3>
<p>— 孫九錄</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利將臨，我國與美國邦交益形親密。美國朝野人士不獨在軍事上援助我爭取最後勝利，且宣示將在經濟上援助我完成戰後建設。於是否政府於前年十一月決定第一期經濟建設原則，昭示中外，規定我國經濟建設事業之經營，必須遵照國父遺敎，為有計劃的實施，以有計劃的自由經濟發展逐漸達到三民主義經濟制度之完成。對於經營方式，應在不違背節制資本之原則下，盡量鼓勵民營企業；對於外齊利用，則依照平等互惠國際經濟合作之精神，在不妨碍主權及計劃實施之前提下，均可接受，藉期以企業自由刺激經濟事業之發展，而完成建設計　。</p>
<p>根據此第一期經濟建設原則，現行各種商事法律，頗多不甚適用。於是立法院自去年起，即開始着手研究修正，而以一切經濟事業憑以組織之公司法爲始。我國公司法於民國十八年十二月二十六日公布以來，施行已逾十四載，內容乃基於歐洲大陸法理，取干涉主義，管制嚴密，不若美國法律對公司取自由主義。際此國際經濟合作時代，自　陳舊；加以爲鼓勵民族資　集於生產之途，與廣闢國外資金獲合作之便利起見，　亦不能不多少傾於自由主義。此外不平等條約取消　，中外事業之平等待遇，與夫政府與人民資本之同等待遇，皆為此次修正公司法之立法主旨。</p>
<p>公可法在修正過程中，曾五易其稿，不可謂不愼。凡在保陣，我國家主權，　　我國工商業發展，及便利中外經濟合作之原則下，各種意見，無不採納，經五月而始完成。現雖未經政府公布，而立法院三讀通過之本，中外人士均已得其梗槪，乃若干國外工商界人士，對於外國公司須在其本國設立登記後有營業者方得在中國境內設立分公司之一點，表示疑慮。茲願為友邦有識之士釋之。</p>
<p>有　如此親定，或將妨碍友邦投資及商業上之發展者。誠如美國公司法取自由主義，不若吾國對公司管制之嚴密，但其對於在中國境內經營之公司，更予以法律上之便利，與納稅上之减免，要知此實受一九二二年所公布之「在華經商條例」China　Trade　Act之特別保護。該條例不但規定在中國境內經營之公司不必在其本國有營業，且同時修改稅律，給予此類在中國營業之公司以一切優越權利，但若在其本國境內同時經營業務時，則又不能享受此項特權。此條例旣予在中國之美國商人絕大利益，使其在中國之商人得與其他各國商人同在减免納稅義務之優越條件之下相互競爭，且受當時領事裁判權之保護，不受中國政府管轄，以致中國工商業無法與之抗衡。其結果，資力雄厚之在中國經營者，受此種特權保護，固無不獲巨利而歸，甚至有少數資力空虛蓄意投機者，亦藉此特權之保護席捲而去。上海美豐銀行與美豐信託公司事件，乃其最顯著之一例。凡此事實，已成歷史上之陳跡。中國與各國間平，新約締結之後，正在修正各種法律，歡迎外資，以符經濟上機會均等互惠合作之精神，尤在友邦偉大的羅斯福總統之經濟的民主主義號召之下，我友邦有遠識之士，當不致固執其傳統的特權觀念，而有所疑慮也。</p>
<p>或有謂，如此規定將使已在中國境內存在之若干外國企業受到影響者。請為進一解。夫國際貿易，始於互通有無，如甲國以製成品運銷乙國，或甲國需要某種製造原料向乙國購買，於是甲國經營此類業務之公司必向乙國請求認許設立分公司，決無在甲國本國毫無業務而在乙國憑空經營如許業務之理。故凡外國公司在其本國已有營業者，無不可請求我國政府認許後在中國境內設立分公司。且按諸國際私法，此類公司之內部關係得依其本國法律辦理。其有在本國並無業務可言，而僅在中國境內經營業務者，除個人或商號組織在所不禁外，凡龐大之公司組織，自可依照中國公司法組織公司經營之。此次修正之公司法，對於任何公司股東，旣無國籍之限制，且無中外投資比例之規定。即外國資本佔百分之九十九，亦無不可。公司構成份子之股東，旣可不問其國籍，則中外資本之平等待遇，不言而喻。甚至政府資本為公司股本時，與其他股東之權利義務，亦完全相同也。其次，凡有限公司與股份有限公司之董事長或代表公司之董事一人，須有中華民國國籍而外，其餘公司內任何重要職務，均可由外國人擔任。至無限公司與有限公司之股東，及股份有限公司之董事，須半數或半數以上在國內有住所之規定，實爲公司管理上之健全着想，非强制任何股東在國內須有住所也。公司法已予中外合資組織公司以如許之便利，則凡在其本國並無業務，而僅在中國境內經營業務之外國公司，依照修正公司法改組，有何不可？試舉一例：如通訊社之業務，在兩國間彼此收發電訊，均有業務，具有國際性。凡外國通訊社之欲在中國設立分社者，當然適合外國公司條件，若在中國境內獨立設一公司組織之報館，自以按照修正公司法組織中國公司經營為合理。他如銀行保險業，其在本國有營業，而在我國設分公司者，其適合外國公司之條件，毫無問題。倘有在其本國並無業務，單獨在中國境內營業者，則基於平等互惠之原則，中國政府自不能聽其吸收我國社會低利資金而絲毫不加過問，應使其受中國銀行與保險業之同樣待遇與管理，毫無疑也。</p>
<p>又次者，以往我國許多公司商號，每有在外國登記後，在外國並無營業，而享受外國特權在中國境內營業，以逃避中國政府之管制者，名曰掛洋旗，通商大埠之公司行號，卵龔於外國特權保護之下者，實不知凡幾—修正公司法對於外國公司之合理限制，正所以取締中國人假借名義，利用外國特權，以逃避中國政府之管理。任何國家對於其本國人民之欲逃避法律與納稅義務者，均非所願，豈獨中國政府然哉？雖然，中國人民亦可在外國組織公司，然後在中國營業。苟無特殊與優越條件，則又何必出此？</p>
<p>總之，一國立法，自有其客觀環境爲依據。即以公司法而論，美國四十八州各有其不同之點。中國於平等新約締結之後，正需要中外經濟合作之時，衹求我國脆弱之工商業有平等發展之機會，凡外養之來助我開發與建設者，無不推誠接受，絕無絲毫加以限制或與本國資本不平等待遇之意。修正公司法親定外國公司須在其本國有營業之一點，不過為消除不平等條的時代特權之遺跡，與限制國人似借名義逃避法律與納稅義務之錯誤觀念而已。各國在我國經營之工商業，如在其本國無營業者，苟非為維護其傳統的特權之享受起見，則又何必不依照我修正公司法租織中國公司哉？況我國涉外立法，對於各友邦均一律待遇，不能單獨為任何一國着想。倘任何外國工商業均以特殊優越地位在我國經營，則我一切條件跪弱之工商業，勢將難以立足，恐非國際經濟上機會均等互惠合作精神之初意，更與美故大總統羅斯福氏之經濟的民主主義，失這毫釐，繆以千里矣。（卅世，二，七於重慶）</p>

<h3>簽名收款　捐贈祖國救濟會</h3>
<p>陳將軍在昆七年中，中外人士請其簽名者頗多，將軍訂有簽名例潤，即係簽名一次，收美金一元。此款派有專人收管登記。月底結算後，一部份寄往美國，捐贈戰時救濟會，一部份交其老翻譯官舒伯炎上校，照美金黑市價換成法幣，由昆市中央銀行，免費匯至重慶，捐贈我國戰時兒童保育會。據聞此項收入，每月的有美金百餘元。</p>
<p>將軍在昆指揮作戰期間，創造了一種新戰術，即用「兩機聯翼」作戰，收效甚大。美國空軍界人士，名之曰「陳納德驅逐戰術一」。並有驅逐戰術專家之稱。同一時，將軍對民航事業，亦富有經騐與興趣。故其再度來華後，數次公開談話中，特別着重於發展中國民用航空一點。他說：今後的民用航空機，應該像火車一樣的便利便宜。中國交通困難，更應注意及此。他願盡個人的力量，協助中國進行此項工作。</p>
<p>「中國空軍從幼稚到成長，能夠奮力作戰，逐步建設起來，得到陳將軍的助力也不少。一（龍雲院長語）昆明人與陳將軍相處七年，知之較深，每逢佳節，必向將軍致慰致敬。陳將軍曾云：「我愛中國，尤愛昆明。」個中原因之一，也許在此。</p>
<h3>驚人消息</h3>
<p>在日本宣佈投降前半個月，一個驚人的消息，首從駝峯之外，飛入了中國。三十四年七月十四日下午，新任中國戰區美陸軍航空隊總司令斯特拉梅耶二級上將，突在加爾各答總部發表聲明稱：「由於陳納德中將之決定退休，美陸軍航空隊將失去一傑出軍官。」翌日，陳將軍即在昆明宣怖，渠憶向魏德滬中將呈請辭去現役職務，準備自美國陸軍退休。十六日，魏德邁將軍在渝發表談話，首謂：「余接受陳納德將軍之次呈，深表遺憾。」末稱：「余謹代表中國戰區之全體美國官兵，祝其前途平安而快樂。」</p>
<p>這消息相繼傳播後，對其功績，備加推崇，對其辭職表示婉惜，滇省臨時參議會，首於七月十六日致函慰留，繼之者為昆市商會，十九日渝參政會亦有同樣表示。但其結果，均無濟於事。二十日下午，陳將軍在昆舉行最後一次記者招待會，首對各界之慰問與慰留，深表謝意。繼稱此次退休後，將携愛犬，同返家園息影</p>
<h3>音樽大會　將軍載榮譽飛去</h3>
<p>二十六日晚，滇桓各界在省黨部舉行音樽大會，歡送陳將軍，參加者有何總司令應欽，周副院長錘嶽等三百餘人，該晚雖無舞會，却有「八義圖」與「水淹七軍」等舊劇，以助餘興。二十七日晚，十四航空隊總部官兵，舉行歡送會，陳將軍曾在會中舉行最後一次授勳禮，將立功勳章，頒予該隊軍官三人。七月二十八日，將軍飛渝，蔣主席即於三十日下午八時，舉行授勳禮，特以我國最高榮譽之靑大白日勳章，親倔於陳將軍之左襟。八月二日下午八時，陪都各機關團體共一百零二個單位，在新運模範區廣場，舉行慰送陳將軍大會，場內外民衆圍觀者數萬人。張藹貞女士代表陪都各界，獻贈特製禮品，計有于院長親書之對聯一付，文曰：「為自由而戰」。「載榮譽以歸」。</p>
<p>八月三日，陳氏飛西安，訪問西北空軍基地，與美空軍將士話別。翌日飛成都，張羣主席在勵志社設宴招待，贈予銀鼎一座。鄧主任並贈以極名貴之古瓷茶壺一隻。八月六日，將軍由蓉飛昆，八日晨遂離昆返美。</p>
<p>「中國的辣斐德」，此次在昆明重遊了兩週，已於二月一日離昆。昆明人希望這是「再見」，次不是「畏別」。氣候類似好萊塢的昆明，正是將軍公忙之餘縱情獵狩之地。（三月一日寄自昆明）</p>
<h3>磁性水雷　如何實行掃除　戰爭舞臺的幕後活動</h3>
<p>— 古德武作　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>英海軍部古德武博士，在其「掃除磁雷」一文導言（見本月一日本報）中說：技術戰爭中最突出的，一塲劇戰、是在無綫電上戰勝的，因此，科學技術家們必須在戰爭舞臺的幕後展開工作。此係前文之續，供讀者參照。（編者）</p>
<p>德國的科學家在老式設計上改進了不少地方。其中一法，是計劃成一種靈巧的鐘，它可在彈簧上自動量出，並確定放置水雷的一種力，在緯綫內均衡鋼桿上磁性吸力必需的一種力。</p>
<p>一九三九年十一月廿四日那著名的一晚上，第一顆德國磁性水雷的分析工作開始。這次分析，不僅曝露了它的運動機構，並且更找出它技術上的正確輪廊形態：便是說找出了施放這種水雷所需要的磁性吸引範圍的咸力，和存續時間。假使找不出這些步驟，抵禦的辦法就很難研究。那天晚上，技術戰士們都曾參與分析工作。</p>
<p>這種技術戰的全部故事公佈後，許多計劃便被採取進行。很多種被試騐過，他們把比目魚縛在吸鐵桿上，飛機上繫着巨大的鋼絲圈，種種方示，不一而足。第一枚爆炸的水雷，引起了極度衝動。各種方法如競賽一樣，反覆實騐。最後，發現了一種主禦法，應用的結果，可使水雷的威脅範圍遠較大戰初舉時的狹小。</p>
<p>這種掃除法是同時用兩艘掃雷艦，每艘尾部拖一條自浮海底電綫的長尾巴，電流從船內發出，是暫時儲藏在電池內的。這電流同時通過尾部的海底電綫，好像是一條洶湧澎湃的巨浪一樣。電流經過電極，通入海水，用這種方法，十英畝以上面積的海底下，一切磁性水雷都會爆發。兩艘掃雷艦在平行綫上前進，繼續佈置它的第二處掃除圈，在這樣掃除辦法之下，清除綫繼延長，英吉利海峽上終於開僻成一條安全的航綫。</p>
<p>在一九三九年十二月底的一個嚴冬晚上，兩只裝滿汽車用電池，各拖那「巨蟒」似的一條掃雷器，駛離希阿乃司港，開始第一次通盤計劃的試騐工作。這次試騐，證實了科學家們電流通入海底磁吸範圍的精確計算。</p>
<p>當天晚上，英海軍部便發出命令，將這偉大計劃，再施以最後一次的改善，同時裝配船隻，訓練人員，這些步驟，都是事先預期在成功以前採取的試騐時所用的木料，以後便代以自浮的海底電綫，由英國最大兩家電綫製造廠設計製造。</p>

<h3>海湘號昨接收</h3>
<p>招商局第六艘勝利輪，改名海湘號，船長祝紹綱，昨晨奉命率領全體船員，前往接收，一切手續及換旗等等，儀式簡單，迄午完竣。自由輪海忠號，定今日接收，該輪為自由輪移交之第一艘，又美輪惠斯弗拉克士號改名海康輪，船長已派關鵬齡充任，定十六日接收。</p>
<h3>中紡所屬各紗廠　生產數量逐有增加　一個月內擴充至五十萬錠</h3>
<p>中國紡織建設公司陸續接收之敵方紗廠十二家，即內外。豐田·日豐·上海等，最初各廠所開錠子總數，不過二十五萬錠以上，目下生產已超過三十七萬錠，預計一個月內，可擴充至五十萬錠左右。如果西北及河南產棉地方，交通暢達，以及外匯率頒布後，內外原料供應不虞，則產量更豐，目下各廠平均每日可產紗三百包，布八千疋。</p>
<p>接收紗布　即將平賣</p>
<p>敵僞產業審議會，於昨晨開會，聞處理局接收偽中日貿易聯合會所存紗布，為量頗鉅，將以其中一，以平價供市，又靑島花生油，日昨已運到一大批，亦將由該局平賣，靑一島所存烟葉，聞先後亦已運到三批，將全部供應各烟廠，對此後香烟價格，可有良好影響。</p>
<h3>組技術會研究　電話不暢原因</h3>
<p>本市電話，因機錢並未擴充，以致市民無法裝得電話，而裝有電話者，亦多感通話不暢。市公用局爰商同上海電信局及上海電話公司，各派高級技術員二人，組織上海市內電話制度技術委員會，預計本年五月底可有切實方，送交有關各機關採　施行。</p>
<h3>農業救濟經費　計二十億元</h3>

<p>書業同業公會整理就緒，經召集會員大會，選出范洗人等十五人為理事，張川如等七人為監事，日昨該會全體理監事宣誓就職，互選葉溯中·李伯嘉·姚　楣·徐伯昕·張一渠五人為常務理事·推李伯嘉為理事長。</p>
<h3>美軍續審日戰犯　四證人出庭陳述　原被告律師曾反覆辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍戰犯審訊委員會，昨晨九時，第五次審訊在漢口殺害三美飛行員之十八個日戰犯。原告辯護者韋斯脫中校，首光引證人張家元出席評答一切。</p>
<p>燒屍取灰擲入水中</p>
<p>張原任漢口日本民團火葬塲之管理員，司雜差之職。一九四四年十二月十六日，見日憲兵押三美兵乘車來塲，又捆綁彼等，至三人被帶走後，察見地上血跡。日憲兵並囑其將二火葬爐燒燃。第二日晨，日兵告其「二爐中所燒者乃壞東西」，令其擲入水中。宋文進即助其將灰剷出，見一號爐中之灰較二號者多。二人繼即將灰埋入西首園中，上作記號。並無其他人得知。及至勝利後，美軍當局至此調查，始告知之。又傳美軍調查失踪人員委員會貝次中尉，將三美飛行員所遺留之皮帶扣，指甲等證件呈上作證。</p>
<p>目睹日兵種種罪行</p>

<h3>黃金與美鈔　昨又捲土重來　金價做到百卅萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因陪都金鈔報漲甚鉅，且前日慘跌過多，逢低廣幫及銀行納胃殊健，美鈔方面助長買氣不少，銀根亦鬆，疲後轉俏，查晨開承前晚餘勢，曾見一一三萬低價，人心因陪都行市帶好，趁低紛紛吸納，漸形穩定，迨後紗廠帮猛扒美鈔，金市得力不少，銀行納胃仍健，錢兌業及證劵幫多頭不斷流出，此後雖漲而多盤，一二〇〇元大關屢進厲退者殊久，廣幫買胃頻仍，午刻突起買風，一時求過於供，盤漲至一二五萬以上而後略平，午收一二四萬八，較前收微升八千，午後籌碼極缺，買戶潮湧，隔日交割曾做高至一三〇萬大關外，而後銀行脫手，降至一二四萬五，最後一二六萬七，銀樓飾金十三萬八，紋銀一千三，銀元七五〇元左右，暗拆銀根稍鬆，自一角二至角半。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔因自由商輸進口，紗廠幫結款殷動，加之百元票拒絕交割，籌碼異常緊枯，自一七三〇元起買戶倍形熱閙，套頭在六七〇元對十兩套買不已，市價步漲不已，曾好至一八七〇元而後稍盤，最後一八四〇元左右，較前收好起一百元，套頭又拔開至六八五元對十兩，此乃金市有隔夜交易，美鈔全屬現交，有以致之，港票昨以港地申鈔回跌，引起買風，老貨受港匯剌激，更為生色，結果老貨好三十元，新貨好六元。</p>
<h3>證券緊迫黃金　後市回漲</h3>
<p>公債　昨因銀根轉鬆，業中紛紛活動，統丙上場雖穩而尚盤，迨股市回振，買戶紛紛活動，遂自一六五〇元盤好至一八八〇元，而後在一八〇〇元關內外盤旋，結果甲乙跌四十元，丁戊跌一百元，丙種則好起二百元，此乃時間關係，雜牌未及趕上，收後丙種喊高至一九〇〇元左右。</p>
<p>華股　昨初低後高，鋇根鬆動，中途雖盤，但結果都以高價結束，收後且續喊高，永紗自二千元，美亞一三五〇元，景福一〇五元逐步盤好，業中畏首畏尾，初時戰戰競競，時間稍久，又復暢懷拉抬，全屬做手，過程平庸，午收較前收計永紗美亞各漲一成餘，景福等小股則昇半成左右，其他冷門則稍轉穩。</p>
<p>外股　亦初疲繼俏，上一場時尚在前收價之下呌喊，迨金市重振，業中人紛來補進，證劵帮亦來活動，午收都以買價結束，較之前收計各漲半成左右，且馬買價。</p>
<h3>紗布略平　紡建略有開出　色貨依舊堅挺</h3>
<p>棉布　十二磅白坯細布通日上漲，昨略見平落，龍頭細布爲五萬五千元，上海中檔坯子在四萬二三千元左右，中國紡織建設公司紅盤後，迄未開售，昨亦對染織廠家開始供售，其種類為彩球細布，開價為五萬四千元，雖為數不多，人心已略見安定，染色貨則因染料漲價，仍屬堅挺，又昨日中國紡織建設公司並開出M．Ｋ．印花紗府綢，價為三萬四千元，跳鯉電光斜三萬元。</p>
<p>棉紗　昨紗市急轉直下，緣前日午後金價續降，銀根亦緊，致同行及散戶求售殊殷，廿支籃鳳紗開盤，即做低三萬，成交八十三萬，旋又降二萬，以八十一萬收市，十六支光明跟跌四萬，普通廿支什牌紗俱小三五萬不等，惟四十支單紗因織廠頻頻問津，所降甚微。</p>
<p>棉花　昨現棉交易轉淡，價亦回軟，純受紗價與布疋影響，廠家略存觀望，僅中紡稍有美棉購進，價做七萬七至七萬九，又八萬二千送廠，價比上日約小二三千元云。</p>
<h3>綢廠配給有着　絲綢市盤步跌</h3>
<p>人造絲市不支下降，一二〇號天橋現貨，上午做一百五十九萬，收盤一百六十萬，金三馬一百五十七萬有成交，棧單做一百〇五萬，下午人心略好，又復回高，天橋現貨喊一百七十萬，棧單一百十二萬，綢廠配給原斜，第一次日上即可出貨，第二次配給，各廠已接到公會通知，最近即須分配，惟數量與價値尙未決定，廠經較前日略疲，下午稍好，上身零擔需一百九十餘萬，交易極稀，綢貨昨市續跌，美亞被面每百條降至一百〇五萬，大誠格　縐上午最小每碼做三千四百五十元，下午最大做三千八百元，民生織錦緞仍照原盤，洪康格璧縐，紫負盛譽，棧單業已應市，昨日收盤價每碼四千五百元，查洪康綢廠為綢業界宣蕚葉君所創辦，該廠出品本外埠銷路甚廣。</p>
<h3>偽公會職員　仍有被選權</h3>
<p>在敵僞時期，曾任各同業公會之職員，現在公會選舉時，有無被選舉權，曾引起各業深切之注意，市商會及本市主管官廳，均會具文請示，茲聞中央業已決定，此項人負，係私法社團人員，非漢奸條例所稱之公職候選人，如果並無該條例第二條第八款第十款之行為，自可參加調整後之人民團體組織云。</p>
<h3>茶葉出新尙遠　執貨一味居奇</h3>
<p>邇來茶葉市况，執貨者鑒於市上存底涸渴，兼以題離產茶期尚遠，因此一味居為奇貨，喊價漫無止境，故買戶咸有納胃，然雙方之談盤，終難趨近，是以做開交易甚少，市面易升難降之象。</p>
<h3>平料售價減低　糧食市況回疲　油餅價亦下瀉</h3>
<p>昨日米市，以糧政局平價米售價减低，人心轉軟，貨主多數吐出，北粳回小千餘元，早薄稻下挫二千元，白元亦小千餘元，秈米跟跌千餘元，油市供過於求，店胃觀望，致價在跌三四千元，黃豆小一二百元不一，豆餅亦疲百元，惟生仁仍為高俏次呆之狀，麵粉小一二百元，各糧均一致下降。</p>
<h3>辦煤須核准？　市價因此愈漲</h3>
<p>煤市因聞商人向外埠採辦運輸煤斤，須得經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會核准，不得私自辦理，咸以為後批商辦煤斤將成問題，市場傳說紛紜，持貨者，除少數因銀根關係逢高吐售，餘均重貨輕鈔，扳持不放，致各貨展開猛烈漲風，普遍一致狂升。</p>
<h3>柴炭行市續昂</h3>
<p>柴炭以產地價格步昻，加之運轍水脚又漲，致辦本加重，又因去歲滬地柴炭市况不景氣，凡客帮辦貨抵滬者均虧本返鄉，致今春到貨轉淡，柴炭同業存有棧貨者，均紛起抬價，行情步升。</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮大轉機</h3>
<p>自去年十二月底二千磅黑鐵坯子傾銷後，三六尺黑鐵皮及黑鐵皮頭子莫不大受打擊，行情直綫下降，截止上月下旬，仍無轉機，直至晚近，始漸漸向榮，上升倍許，刻三六尺六張黑鐵皮，每担沽五萬元，黑鐵皮頭子貨每担售四萬二千元。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>男女間</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>男女間的最大不同，自然是在一是男，一是女。它裏面包括着生理上的不同，和生理上不同而產生的某些心理上的不同，但這，我以為也應該只是唯一的不同。</p>
<p>歷史的人為，事實的無情，常使社會上人，對於男女之間，各懷成見與偏見，在能力上，智慧上，性格上，好像都有天然之不同。</p>
<p>人是生活於現實裘的，一個人太忽視了現實，只佔着時間，而失了空間，簡直就無法生活。但現實究竟是罪惡者，一個人過分的現實，就會專製造罪惡。</p>
<p>我認為對男女間偏見最深的，還是「聖人」孔子，他的那一句：「惟女人與小人難養也」的名言，爲後世所有的男子所傳誦，亦為後世所有男子對女子取蔑視態度的罪惡的最大憑藉。</p>
<p>事實上，或者眞是：「惟女人與小人雖養」，但女人與小人列在一起，女人與小人同樣的難養，那是男性社會的人為，那是人還沒有眞正自覺，而表現出來的罪惡標記。孔子：「惟女人與小人難養也」的名言，是只根據現實的錯誤所下的結論。</p>
<p>女子爲什麼不可以與男子一樣的做事，做男子的事？這完全是制度的問題。男子總是把女子關在家裘，總是把女子當成玩物，已有數千年，數萬年的歷史。因之，一旦某些男子要請女子跑到社會上來，不把她當成玩物，她反以為是那些男子故意捉弄她，苛求她，虐待她。</p>
<p>有一天，忽然世界上來一個大變，所有原來是男子做的事，都交女子去做，女子做的事，都叫男子去做（除了生孩子以外）。一過百年，千年，你看那時候還是不是：「惟女人與小人難養也」，恐怕就變成為：「惟男人與小人難養也」了。　從男女間的問題上，來探討人都要眞正成個人，就要翻壓歷史的案。社會上其他許許多多的間題，要使它都合理，也都要翻歷史的案。</p>
<p>如要求得解放，人與人之間，要談到平等，那末第一件事，男女間的偏見成見，首先應該澈底打破。</p>
<h3>浮世</h3>
<p>— 徐家塘</p>
<p>『浮世』這兩個字不好，因為牠讀起來好像多少有點出世之感似的，讓人覺得這世界是浮游在一種虛無飄渺的大漠中，和浮　，和浮萍，有同樣的短促　茫之感。</p>
<p>好儘管不好，但牠仍常常出現在文人的筆下，因為牠美麗，因為牠有詩意。兩個字包含着無盡的感慨，再用不着修飾，用不着雕琢，便是一句極漂亮的辭</p>
<p>在日本，聽說有一種極著名的浮世繪，我沒有看見過，不敢妄論。在中國，我却看見有人寫過「浮世的悲哀」和「浮世散記」之類。寫這類文章的人，文筆都很秀麗，冲淡中還有點淡淡的哀愁。其實這是一種出發點的不同，如果沒有「浮世」，那麼悲哀也許就變成憤怒了。</p>
<p>此如說：我們描寫一個窮敎員，由學校的會計課中領到一月中極微渺的薪水，默默的走出來，心中懷着點自憐，道途中，他聽見一個學生說：「近來，×先生　不趨力氣來了，他淡淡的　這是有點「浮世的悲哀」的，但是，於事何補呢？窮敎員仍默默的拿着那可憐的薪水，打不起精神的敎着書，對於寫文章的人也不免有點「浮世的悲哀」了。</p>
<p>人是有些喜歡戲弄一下感情的！什麼東西能够帶給他一點蒼茫，一點點輕微的哀愁，便用力的攫住，品評的說牠有美感。因為牠便祇讓他的眼淚在眼中轉，沒有淌下來，沒有號淘大哭。至於這眼淚起了什麼作用沒有？想不到，也不用想。這樣他是有些愛好「浮世」這兩個字了。但愛得太消極，沒有轉到背面去看，背面有一面鏡子，在背面看見：你嫌這世界太飄渺，太短促，但實際，在這輕藴的眼淚裹面，已經浪費了這浮世的短促。</p>
<p>如果我們在歹土上生活過，再如果我們很喜歡「浮世」這兩個漂亮的字面，我們在「戶口米」道三個字上就可以描寫出極其美感的「浮世的悲哀」。不過是有些把自己太脫離現實了。我們要料到「戶口米」這三個字的背後去看，那裏也有一面鏡子：是做奴隸的憤怒。</p>
<p>講究美學的先生們都喜歡這一套，願意在悲劇中搜尋出喜感來，說是人們都是這麼殘酷的，我有一個傻想法，以為這些先生們不僅是喜歡戲弄感情，大半還有些喜歡玩弄文字吧？</p>
<p>我自己是有這麼一種偏狹的看法。實際上我對於寫「浮世的悲哀」和「浮仳散記」之類的先生們並沒有惡感。不過有一點一吐爲快的意見，覺得現在生活太艱，紙張很貴，這些美飾過的辭藻未未始沒有用，但要等昇平以後再說，至於現在好像還在亂世，日子旣是短的，我們莫浪費了自己之後再來浪費別人，所以，浮世云云……</p>
<p>還要等些日子，我們才有工夫塡詞。</p>
<h3>紫色的禮讚</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>我曾經愛那朝霞似的嬌紅，在朝霞似的美麗的童年，因此，到現在，那芬芳的桃林裹，還藏着幾許天眞而難忘的舊夢……</p>
<p>後來我漸漸喜歡素靜的藍色，藍天，藍色的海水，不時的被我歌頌，我還祈禱着最好有一位藍天使，將綠葉紅花都抹上輕輕的，淡淡的，一些微藍，我盼望着絕美的大自然界裏有一個可愛的藍的國。</p>
<p>不知道從什麼時候起我忽然覺得紫色的可愛，這美麗而憂傷的色彩，像抒情的樂童，黃昏時節的斜陽，蒙了塵埃的五彩西洋油繪，艷如桃李而又冷若冰霜的美婦人，聲聲喚着「不如歸去」的杜鵑。</p>
<p>紫荆樹，紫色的丁香，淡紫的菜頭花……金來入夢，只是，全能的造物為什麼不讓每一朶鬰金香也幻作紫色？我總覺得只有紫色才配這有鬰金香名字的花朶。</p>
<p>假使我有「天方夜譚」裏那隻神奇的魔術寶戒，那麼，只要一朶永不凋謝的濃紫色的鬱金香，就滿足了我當前的想望。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（十三）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>翁老爺又笑了！</p>
<p>「哈哈……一個剛生下來的嬰兒，總免不了要『呱呱』一陣。哭也是那麼個聲音，笑也是那麼個聲音；唱也是那麼個聲音，呌也是那麼個聲音；您怎麼能斷定她就是向您哭？也許是她向你笑；向你唱；向你呌哩！」</p>
<p>翁老爺的一派話，說得　老爺啞口無言，他啄磨了一會兒，覺得翁老爺的解釋，頗有道理。於是他化愁為喜地笑着說：</p>
<p>一到底老弟此我聰明！我今兒早晨怎麼也想不開，而且越想越糊塗，簡直地煩惱不堪。如今給您這樣一解說，我這才茅塞頓開，恍然大悟了！不過，我夢見我所坐的那隻船被風浪打沉下去，這一點恐怕不大吉利吧？還有那張莫明其妙的傳單，傳單上的一片維新論——</p>
<p>墨老爺雖然對於鳥兒的疑問，得到答案了，可是，又記起那沉船的事，和那張突如其來的傳單上面的字句，他於是禁不住又有些憂慮了。</p>
<p>翁老爺對於這後來的兩個問題更覺得不値一慮了，他說：</p>
<p>「您坐了船要到長江上游的一個地方去當然是回荊州呀！而　偏折轉身向順流而下，您的意思是又想到北京去，可是北京的皇室，被維新人物，革命給革完了，因此，咱們才落得這般光景！所以那風浪就是譬喻維新人物，那隻沉了底兒的船就是譬喻咱們的今天。大哥，我勸您還是想開的好！別緊直咕嚕過去了的事兒，咕嚕多了，就會作夢。咱們老都老了，還作什麼夢呢？」翁老爺說到最後也有些戚然。他的意思是雙關的，他勸墨老爺不要再作夢了，也就是勸墨老爺不要再多餘的幻想了。</p>
<p>翁老爺這種語重心長的勸告，撩起墨老爺無限的感傷。墨老爺懂得翁老爺的意思，因此他乾了一杯酒，惆悵地說：</p>
<p>「我早不想什麼了，我只盼望着快一點閉了眼睛！人，活到這麼個光景，倒不如死了的痛快！」說到這兒，墨老爺的眼裏有點兒濕，要不是他怕老爺見笑，他眞想哭出來。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻！」翁老爺從鼻子裏冷笑了兩聲，然後又吸着的烟，說：「好死不如歹活着」我可不像您那麼書江字氣！這年頭兒認眞不了許多，只有過一天算一天。今日有酒今日醉，今天有烟今天吸！</p>

<h3>Chairman Holds Reception Today: Comforting Elders After Eight Years of Separation; Long Conversation with Wedemeyer Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, the entire city's populace has been ecstatic. Yesterday, flags continued to be hung in tribute. To understand the suffering of the citizens, the Chairman has established a Secretariat at Qiqi Road to receive official letters and petitions from all sectors. He is scheduled to host reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and representatives of comrades who suffered hardship at the City Hall Auditorium this morning. This afternoon, the Chairman and his wife will hold a reception on Route de Ghis similar to the one at Huairentang in Beiping, to comfort the city's elders whom they have been separated from for eight years.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Chairman and his wife traveled by car directly from their official residence to the Soong Family Cemetery on Hongqiao Road to pay respects at Madam Soong's tomb. The Chairman wore a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, over which he wore a black wool overcoat. Madam wore a grey-colored velvet overcoat. Yu Jishi, Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, rode in the same car. Qian Dajun, Zhang Daofan, and aides-de-camp followed behind in four cars. Upon arriving at the cemetery, the Chairman and his wife stepped out of the car and walked to Madam Soong's tomb, where they stood respectfully. After Huang Renlin presented a wreath, they bowed three times in respect, lingered for about twenty minutes, and then returned to their residence by car. At 11:50 AM, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China, accompanied by his secretary Wu Hanmin, paid respects to the Chairman to hold an important discussion on military issues within China. The Chairman and his wife also invited Mr. Wedemeyer to lunch at their residence. Mr. Wedemeyer and his secretary departed at 3:33 PM. According to Chairman Zhang Daofan, Mr. Wedemeyer's visit with the Chairman was to discuss various issues related to military affairs.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM, General Wedemeyer and Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Navy in China, hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel to welcome the Chairman and his wife and to express their welcome. Those invited to the grand banquet included Mr. and Mrs. Chen Cheng, Qian Dajun, Zhou Zhirou, Zhang Daofan, Shen Shihua, Huang Renlin, Yu Jishi, Shen Changhuan, and others. The Chairman and his wife arrived at 8:00 PM. General Wedemeyer dispatched his liaison officer, Major Matte, to greet them respectfully at the main entrance. U.S. military police stood at attention to salute. The Chairman wore formal attire, and Madam wore a long black qipao (cheongsam) with a leather coat. Both were smiling broadly. Upon reaching the tenth floor, General Wedemeyer stepped forward to shake hands warmly with the Chairman and his wife. The party enjoyed the evening and dispersed at 10:00 PM. U.S. attendees included the Consul General in Shanghai, George Atcheson Jr., Chief of Staff of the U.S. Military Headquarters, General Merbeck, Deputy Chief of Staff Kellerhui, and other senior generals.</p>

<h3>The New First Army Has Been Secretly Sent Off from Guangdong, Via Kowloon, to the Northeast; No Definite Date Yet for the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 12th] It was revealed here today that the Chinese New First Army began yesterday to depart from Guangdong to the Northeast via Kowloon. The departure of the New First Army, and the possible arrival of General Marshall and Zhou Enlai in Guangdong this week, further suggests that the fighting within Guangdong has, in fact, come to an end. The New First Army has been stationed in Guangdong since November of last year, awaiting U.S. transport ships to go to Japan to participate in the military occupation of Honshu. After this plan was cancelled, the army was scheduled to go to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Cannot Receive the Northeast Without Making More Concessions</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] A certain senior Chinese official who recently returned to Chongqing from the Northeast expressed his opinion today that although the Soviet side appears to be assisting China on the surface, China may not be able to receive the Northeast unless it makes more concessions to the Soviet side.</p>
<p>Economic Concessions</p>
<p>It is recalled that when Chairman Chiang met with reporters on February 5th, he acknowledged that he was engaged in informal negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding economic concessions beyond the publicized terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The day after Chairman Chiang's reception for reporters, a certain Chinese official spokesman stated that the Chinese side had not requested that the deadline for the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast be extended beyond February 1st.</p>
<p>Assassination Incidents</p>
<p>The Chinese official who returned to Chongqing stated that Chinese people in Changchun and Harbin are subject to a curfew after 5:00 PM. Outside of the two main thoroughfares, personal safety is not guaranteed, and assassinations still occur from time to time. Chinese newspapers in these cities also frequently report on assassinations. The official Central News Agency issued a dispatch from Changchun on February 9th stating that Zhang Xinfu, special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Northeast, and four other personnel were killed in the Fushun coal mining area north of Shenyang by over three hundred armed bandits. A certain senior Chinese official accused that these bandits were, in fact, Soviet troops under the command of a certain major general who was in charge of the Fushun area. The nominally independent "World Daily" also had a similar report on February 5th, stating that seven people were missing and one person escaped. "The Nationalist Gazette" stated on February 9th that officials sent from Chongqing to the Northeast were frequently assassinated.</p>
<p>Training Troops</p>
<p>The Chinese official who returned to Chongqing said that the Soviet army in the Northeast has trained and equipped 400,000 local troops, some of whom are puppets of the Communist Party, but most of whom are guerrillas who fled to the Soviet territory during the Japanese occupation. He also stated that there were 200,000 troops from Yan'an who, under the orders of the Soviet side, entered the Northeast after the Japanese surrender. The official revealed that no withdrawal action by the Soviet army can be expected before May. He stated that the barracks and military installations have been repaired, and the Soviet army's demobilized soldiers in the Northeast have all returned to their country, replaced by new troops. The official said that only empty houses remain of the important heavy industrial factories, and the main equipment and installations have been transported to the Soviet Union. He stated that important railways and other means of transportation are still under the control of the Soviet army, as reported by the Central News Agency.</p>
<p>When to Withdraw</p>
<p>It is understood that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has twice invited Soviet Ambassador Petrov to his office to discuss when the Soviet army will begin to withdraw. The Soviet Ambassador replied that he must cable Moscow. Recent newspaper reports have emphasized the difficulties of the situation in the Northeast. Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in the Northeast, has traveled to the Northeast several times, and Madame Chiang has also recently traveled to the Northeast. "Peace Daily" stated that officials of the National Government who are to take over the provinces in the Northeast are currently stationed in Changchun and Harbin. Some newspapers said that there is currently no conflict between the government forces and the communist forces in the Northeast. "Central Daily News" published today: Chiang's Northeast Headquarters has established a Sino-Soviet Joint Military Police Inspectorate to be responsible for maintaining order in the area near Fushun, Shenyang.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Zhang Case</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] The "World Daily," an independent right-wing newspaper, published an editorial today calling on the government to thoroughly investigate the truth of the assassination of Zhang Xinfu, Special Envoy to the Northeast, last month, because "this case is not only a murder case, but also an important event affecting China's sovereignty in the Northeast." The editorial stated that this incident has sullied the reputation of the Allied nations and threatens the future peace of Asia. The newspaper pointed out: Fushun is located within a coal mining area and is guarded by Soviet troops. No armed forces other than the Soviet army are allowed to enter. Who would believe that Zhang Xinfu was killed by three hundred bandits? The editorial concluded that China has refused to accept any conditions that would harm the Soviet Union and that China also believes that the Soviet Union would not deliberately violate its promises and damage its reputation.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Sichuan-Xikang Road Included in the Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] It is learned that the Ministry of Communications' plans for the construction of the Sichuan-Xikang Railway have now been included in the Five-Year Plan.

In addition, the air stations from Xichang south to Kunming, north to Chengdu, and east to Chongqing can be opened as soon as the American planes arrive.</p>
<h3>Military Demobilization Conference to be Held in Nanjing Mid-Month; Generals from the Southeast Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The first military conference held in Nanjing after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan will open in the near future. Most of the commanders of units at the division level and above stationed in the southeastern provinces and along the Yangtze River will come to Nanjing to attend. The conference is clearly not nationwide. It is reported that the central issues will include the reorganization, education, and supply of the military, and reports from the attending generals will also be heard, submitted for review, and then discussed. Countries around the world are competing to discuss demobilization and disarmament after the war. China cannot be an exception. However, people in Nanjing today believe that the difficulty of China's demobilization and disarmament can be said to be unique. It is believed that this conference will focus on discussions on military aftermath. Chairman Chiang will attend in person to preside.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to reliable sources, the military authorities believe that demobilization work needs to be promoted urgently. A military demobilization conference will be convened in Nanjing to discuss it in detail. The date may be the 15th of this month. General He Yingqin will preside. It is heard that senior generals from the southeastern provinces have been invited to attend. Chairman Chiang may come to Nanjing to preside over the opening ceremony and deliver instructions in person.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch] Commander Lu Han of the First Front Army stated: "My stay in Vietnam this time will last several weeks. The work of accepting the surrender here has been largely completed. According to plan, over 30,000 Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents in Vietnam can be repatriated to Japan starting April 1st. This work is relatively easy. However, the transportation of weapons and materials surrendered by the Japanese army will take longer, as the quantity is considerable and requires 200 ships." The rumor that our army has begun to withdraw from North Vietnam is inaccurate. The current troop movements are for the purpose of rotation. However, now that the military period is coming to an end, future issues concerning Vietnam will be handled through normal diplomatic channels. Therefore, China and France have agreed that all future negotiations will be held in our capital, rather than discussed locally. Over 4,000 French troops stationed in Yunnan have been permitted by our country to enter Vietnam, and this batch of troops will be stationed in Laos. Lu also stated: "The future of the Vietnamese independence movement depends on the strength of Vietnam itself. According to the general trend of international affairs, France will also be willing to grant the Vietnamese a higher degree of autonomy." Lu also believes that France and Vietnamese revolutionaries are already in negotiations.</p>
<h3>Optimism Remains for Transportation Recovery; Organizations in Beiping and Tianjin Suggest Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th dispatch] Relevant authorities here have not yet received formal notification of the four points of agreement on restoring transportation, as stated in the 10th Communiqué released by the Military Mediation Department in Beiping on the 11th. According to a certain gentleman who recently returned to Nanjing after inspecting the transportation situation in North China, the people of North China now believe that nothing is more urgent than transportation. The industrial and commercial organizations in Beiping and Tianjin have suggested to the Military Mediation Department ways to resolve the disputes: (1) Request the Communist Party to abandon its prejudices against participating in railway management, so that transportation can be restored first to save the refugees. (2) Request both armies to first reach an agreement on maintaining railway freight, so that goods can flow smoothly to stabilize prices. (3) Request that the dispute over transportation management rights be left to be discussed and resolved after the National Assembly, when the government is reorganized. It is reported that the representatives of both sides in the Military Mediation Department, because the government insists on quickly restoring transportation to save millions of refugees in the recovered territories, are willing to discuss the rest at length and have been making every effort to adopt parallel proposals. Optimism remains for the recovery of transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th dispatch] The Executive Group received an urgent telegram from Zhang Jingyue, commander of the Zhangdian Security Division, stating that the Communist army was gathering, with over ten thousand troops, declaring they would attack Zhangdian immediately. At 10:00 PM on the 10th, 800 Communist troops in Zhangzhuang, northeast of Zhangdian, fired into the city of Zhangdian with grenade launchers. I followed orders and did not retaliate. Please send someone for mediation quickly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th dispatch] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has specially dispatched the Taian Group to take special responsibility for mediating the Taian issue. The American representative of the group, Lieutenant Colonel Napp, and the head of the government representative group, Lu Xiang, flew to Jinan by special plane from Beiping on the 10th, and are scheduled to go to Taian with the Communist representative today. In order to conduct effective mediation, the group will be stationed permanently in Taian. Regarding the issue of puppet troops, government representative Lu Xiang said that the Executive Headquarters has already agreed on a solution and has telegraphed it to various places for compliance. According to news from military and political authorities here, the situation in Zhangdian and Zhoucun is becoming tense again. The main forces of the 9th Division of the Communist Army, Qian Jun, and the 4th Division, Liao Rongbiao, are advancing north from Boshan, making conflict very likely. However, the Communist representative in Jinan denied this. However, Colonel Lake and others in Beiping have learned of the tense situation in Zhangdian and are scheduled to return from Beiping on the 11th to Zhangdian for mediation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th dispatch] The Xuzhou Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Zaozhuang on the 11th to inspect the mining area and is scheduled to fly to Haizhou on the 12th for inspection.</p>
<p>Mediation in Taiyuan Stalled; Communist Party Representative Has Not Yet Arrived</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Taiyuan, 11th dispatch] Shanxi, a mountainous province bordering the Yellow River, possesses the richest coal and iron deposits in China. The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters will face a serious test here, as the ceasefire and transportation restoration orders in the province are still in a delicate state of stalemate. There are over 400,000 enemy troops in the entire province of Shanxi, including one division of the Central Army, 260,000 regular troops under Yan Xishan, 40,000 Japanese troops, and an uncertain number of Communist troops, estimated to be over 100,000. Although no large-scale battles have occurred, troop movements are frequently reported. According to Yan Xishan, who has governed Shanxi for over 35 years, there is an 80% hope that the ceasefire order can be implemented smoothly, but others are more pessimistic. The three-person group sent here by the Executive Headquarters from Beiping includes Colonel Holle of the American side and Major General Zhou of the Central side, but the Communist Party representative has not been assigned, for strategic or other reasons. The reporter witnessed the two being at a loss. Holle arrived here from Datong on the 3rd of this month. In Datong, the Holle Group concluded a broad mediation agreement on the 6th, which earned the praise of Special Envoy Marshall, who called it "perfect work achieved in a very difficult situation." Although the Executive Group here has no work, complaints have been filed by all parties. According to Yan, since the ceasefire order was announced on January 13, the Communist army has occupied more than four counties. Of the 106 counties in Shanxi, 39 are in the hands of the Communist army. The commander of the Japanese First Army, Kakuta, frankly admitted that since the end of the war, his troops had had countless contacts with the Communist army. After January 13, three Japanese soldiers were killed, six were injured, and twelve were captured. The group has also received reports that the cities of Taiyuan and Datong are both under food blockade. The reporter did not feel a shortage of food in Taiyuan. The rumor that the city's food supply is only enough for 230,000 residents for four days is not credible, judging from the shops filled with goods. It is even possible to buy American coffee in the shops, although the price is extremely high, requiring 6,000 French currency per pound. In the major cities under Yan Xishan's control, donkey carts and camel teams are allowed to transport supplies to the outside of the city, which seems to be the case, but they return empty. Although telephone communication is being vigorously restored, Communist soldiers with bayonets are obstructing it in the countryside. The traffic between Datong and Taiyuan was only open for three days, and it is reported that it was interrupted again due to the burning of a railway bridge somewhere in the middle. These situations occurred after the issuance of the ceasefire order and the establishment of the Datong District Mediation Agreement. According to the observation of the representatives of the group here, there are obstacles between the signing of the agreement and its actual implementation that could endanger the entire mediation and ceasefire issue.</p>

<h3>Security Council Adjourns Again Yesterday; Difficult to Resolve East Indies Issue; US Representative Opposes Organizing Investigation Team</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 12th dispatch: The Security Council met today. The first speaker was the Mexican representative, who advocated organizing a fact-finding commission to obtain information about Indonesia. It is said that without accurate information, the Security Council can never take any decision. Then the French representative, Pide, spoke, advocating that the Indonesian issue should be resolved in accordance with the review method of the Greece issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin did not attend and was represented by Jadja.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 12th dispatch: The Security Council meeting today made no decision and adjourned until 9:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 12th dispatch: The Deputy Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies, Van Mook, continued to negotiate with the Indonesian Prime Minister on issues related to Indonesia today.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th dispatch] Ukrainian representative Manuilsky stated in the United Nations Security Council today that General Mallaby, commander of the British troops in the East Indies, was killed by Japanese special agents "because the British army failed to disarm the Japanese army in the area." Manuilsky's bomb-like statement contradicted the British Foreign Secretary Bevin's claim that he was killed by Indonesian extremists. General Mallaby was assassinated in early autumn last year. When Foreign Secretary Bevin first argued the East Indies issue to the United Nations agency, he used the case as an excuse for the British army to temporarily use the Japanese army to maintain order before it arrived in the East Indies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th dispatch] The head of the US delegation to the United Nations agencies, Stettinius, stated in the Security Council last night that he opposed the Council sending a commission to Java. This was the first statement by the United States on the Indonesian dispute. Before Stettinius spoke, the Council had been debating for two hours whether the Ukrainian delegation had the right to submit a formal resolution proposing a commission to investigate on the ground. The debate on the Indonesian stalemate continued until this morning, but the Council has decided to allow Ukraine to make a proposal, while the Australian and American representatives have spoken out against sending a commission. During last night's debate, only the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, did not formally oppose the Ukrainian proposal. Stettinius said: "There is no need for investigation. Any action by the Council will hinder Batavia's argument." However, the Council should express its hope that the terms of the surrender of the Japanese army will be "implemented immediately." He is confident that the Council hopes that negotiations will succeed to "meet the legitimate desire for autonomy of the Indonesian people." Chairman Makin, representing Australia, said: "The British army in Java does not threaten peace, and the Council has no reason to interfere. But if a commission is sent, Australia also wants to send a representative to participate."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Speaks, Declaring China's Position; Does Not Oppose Sending Investigation Team</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th dispatch] Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, expressed his views on the Indonesian issue during the Security Council debate yesterday, stating that he does not object in principle to the Ukrainian representative's proposal to send an investigation team to Indonesia. Gu said: "We are not advocating investigating this case, but since some governments sincerely hope to obtain more information about the situation in the area, we believe that an investigation team may be able to contribute. The Chinese delegation, based on this reason, and not due to a lack of trust in the United Kingdom, will not oppose the Ukrainian proposal." There are over two million overseas Chinese in the Netherlands East Indies, most of whom live in Java. Since the military action began in September last year, many Chinese have been killed and injured. In Surabaya alone, 500 overseas Chinese were killed in the past four months. These reports are not yet final reports. Regarding the Indonesian national movement, the Chinese in Java have tried their best to avoid involvement, but their sympathy is naturally with the side that is striving for autonomous government. The Chinese people, as well as all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations, including the Dutch people, have deep sympathy for the Indonesian people. The Chinese delegation believes that this matter may be postponed for discussion to see the results of the direct negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands.</p>

France, backed by some Latin American countries and all Arab countries, advocated postponing the vote and advocated that the permanent headquarters be located in San Francisco Bay. China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom all advocated choosing the Greenwich-Stamford area. The United States did not vote. Philippine representative Lopez said: "If the Greenwich-Stamford area is elected, there will be a day when we will encounter pickets holding signs saying 'Do not put the United Nations agency here.'"</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 11th dispatch] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, arguing that some countries, including a few members of the United Nations agencies, are still hiding war criminals, advocating that all countries should take all necessary measures to arrest all war criminals.

<h3>Secret Speech on Currency Exchange Arouses Questions from British Members of Parliament</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 11th dispatch] Former British wartime Prime Minister Churchill recently sold three copies of his secret speeches in the House of Commons during the war to the American Life magazine.

Attlee replied that the speaker has the right to publish his speeches. He was asked again whether the copyright belongs exclusively to the speaker. Attlee replied that he would consult lawyers before replying to this matter.</p>
<h3>US Distributes Memorandum Condemning Argentina; List of Misdeeds Too Numerous to Mention</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The US government distributed a memorandum to the envoys of various South American countries stationed in Washington (excluding Argentina) and US envoys to various South American countries tonight, publicly condemning the Argentine government for almost establishing a "dictatorial government" in the Western Hemisphere, and directly accused the regime led by Colonel Peron of "actively assisting" the Axis powers, attempting to undermine the Pan-American system through "smoke screen tactics." This document will serve as the basis for Pan-American consultations, and the various misdeeds of Argentina listed therein are too numerous to mention.</p>
<h3>Restricted by Anglo-Siamese Treaty; Stagnation of Overseas Chinese Rice Industry in Siam; Economic Situation Inconceivable if This Continues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 11th dispatch] The delegation sent by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce recently visited Siam to investigate the commercial situation of overseas Chinese. After completing the task and returning, they said: "The business situation of overseas Chinese in Siam, especially the rice industry, is really disappointing. The economic situation of overseas Chinese is very poor." The reason is that during the Japanese occupation period, most of the rice industry engaged in by overseas Chinese was stagnant. Furthermore, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese during the occupation period were too heavy. Due to the newly revised provisions of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty, the rice industry in peacetime should be controlled by the Siamese government, so rice must be sold to a government. This is different from the free foreign trade of Chinese merchants before the war. According to the delegation, if this situation continues, the economic situation of overseas Chinese will be inconceivable.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming Has Arrived in Washington; Will Visit US President</h3>

<h3>Sino-British Trade Has Begun; Britain Hopes for Stability in Our Currency</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 12th dispatch] British goods have been shipped to China in a steady stream. According to London business circles, since the New Year, five or six British merchant ships have loaded goods in British ports and sailed to China. In addition, two British ships are planned to continue transporting British goods to China in the near future. However, at present, the goods are only enough to load one ship per week for shipment. There is reportedly no such difficulty in shipping goods from China to the UK. Ships can also be prepared quickly. British people who are interested in Sino-British trade believe that the purchase of Chinese goods has been shelved due to the uncertain exchange rate. Therefore, the statement issued to the press by Chinese Finance Minister Yu Hongjun that the Chinese government has resolved the issue of foreign exchange and that measures to stabilize currency and prices have been decided has been warmly welcomed in London. Once the scheduled steps are implemented, Chinese goods will be shipped to the UK in a steady stream, which will benefit both China and the UK.</p>
<h3>Affected by the Disciplinary Instruction; Japanese Cabinet to Be Reorganized Again; There is a Saying That the General Election Will Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Well-informed political observers stated today that since the serious significance of MacArthur's instruction was made public on Saturday, the Shidehara Cabinet is bound to be reorganized again. Of the important cabinet members affected by this instruction, Nakamoto and Kobayashi have already been affected. Government officials, professional soldiers, and people in financial and industrial institutions, all those with extreme nationalist tendencies, are all affected by this instruction and may not serve as public officials.

The Yomiuri Shimbun also said that the Shidehara Cabinet is now using the current unstable political situation to maintain its power.</p>

<h3>Germany: Lower Rhine Region Still Severely Flooded; Waters Near Essen Reach Above Head Level; Residents Isolated in High Buildings Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The Frankfurt Radio stated yesterday that the Rhine region is experiencing its worst flooding in thirty-five years. Many cities in the British sector are isolated, power is cut off, and the railway between Berlin, Bremen, and Frankfurt has been severed. The Hohenzollern Bridge is the only safe crossing point over the Rhine. The Weser and Elbe rivers are also experiencing floods, with water advancing at speeds exceeding eleven miles per hour.</p>
<p>[United Press, British Army Headquarters on the Rhine, 11th] The Emscher Canal overflowed its banks near Gelsenkirchen today, causing a flood ten feet deep.

<h3>Giant Airship: Carries 100 Passengers, Weighs 120 Tons; Landing Resembles a Car Pulling into a Station</h3>
<p>[British News Service, London, 12th] Britain is assisting in the construction of a civilian airship that is larger than the 100-ton R.101 currently being built in the United Kingdom. It can carry 100 passengers, has a range of 5,000 miles, and a speed of 300 to 350 miles per hour. It weighs 120 tons. Overseas Airlines will invest £10 million to order twenty of these airships for use on British civilian air routes.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The renowned British aircraft manufacturer, Roe Aircraft Company, has invented a new device that makes airship landings as easy as a train pulling into a station. Airship landings are generally much more inconvenient than airplane landings. After an airship reaches its destination, it must moor to a pontoon, and passengers must transfer to a motorboat to reach the shore. This inconvenience has been solved by Roe Company's invention of an automatic cable connector. The new method uses several pontoons to support the cable at the waterline. After landing, the airship approaches the cable, attaches to the automatic connector, and is then towed to the station by a winch. The reverse method allows for a smooth take-off.</p>

<p>Supporting the Original Draft of the New Company Law: Xue Mingjian, Chairman of the Sunan District Branch of the China National Industries Association, believes that after the new Company Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan, the Supreme National Defense Council deleted the words "business" from Article 2 and Article 292, which would benefit the development of bureaucratic capital and violate the principles of economic construction. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, stating: "Having learned that the new Company Law has been passed by your esteemed Yuan and that the Supreme National Defense Council has deleted the words 'business' from Article 2 and Article 292, this association has studied it and believes that the deletion will not only benefit the development of bureaucratic capital but also violate the principles of the economic construction program. If foreign companies are not required to operate in their home countries before being allowed to establish branches in China, all domestic companies will become disguised foreign branches, which will not only harm Chinese-owned industries and businesses and reduce national tax revenue. We urge your esteemed Yuan to support the provisions of the original draft to benefit industrial and commercial enterprises." (Remainder omitted)</p>

<h3>Structures 70 Feet Below London: The Secret of the Underground Headquarters; Churchill's Military Facility for Planning Strategy and Winning Battles from Thousands of Miles Away</h3>
<p>—Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>Seventy feet beneath London, the British built a series of underground air-raid shelters. It was here that wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his cabinet decided the fate of the nation.</p>
<p>The underground cabinet was protected by sixteen feet of reinforced concrete, with gas-proof doors and steel mesh against bombs. It was built as early as 1938. Its location is beneath the government buildings, extending from "Whitehall" to "St. James's Park."</p>
<p>Managed by the Royal Navy: Internal Structure Mimics a Battleship</p>
<p>The underground headquarters contained a total of one hundred and twenty-seven rooms. The low-ceilinged corridors resembled the interior of a battleship, like the narrow passages within a warship. It was equipped with ventilation ducts, air regulators, and pipelines, all built in the style of a battleship and managed by the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>The heart of the underground complex was the "War Room," staffed by personnel of at least the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
<p>In his office (see Figure 1), Churchill delivered most of his important speeches. The map on the wall of his office (i.e., bedroom) (see left corner of Figure 1) marked the hypothetical defense locations during the German invasion of Britain.</p>
<p>The Attlees Also Lived Here Together</p>
<p>During the Blitz, Churchill and his wife lived there permanently. The current Prime Minister Attlee and his wife lived in another small room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill's bedroom contained soft and comfortable sofas and beds, and antique mirrors with gilded frames. Churchill's daughter, Miss Mary, also lived there with them from time to time.</p>
<p>The Cabinet's "War Room" had two or three dozen green baize-covered desks, with Churchill sitting in a round-backed chair in the center. Most of the major military actions were decided here.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Crates of Food for Emergency Use</p>
<p>Churchill's private dining room was adjacent to his bedroom, small and simple, with four seats. Churchill often entertained the King and other dignitaries there. The underground kitchen, equipped with electric stoves, was also managed by the Royal Navy. Three thousand large crates of beef, biscuits, tea, and ham were stored here, in case the exits of the underground complex were blocked by bombing, to serve as an emergency supply.</p>

<p>The transatlantic telephone (see Figure 2) connected directly to Washington, D.C., used exclusively by Churchill and the White House (then President Roosevelt) for communication. It was equipped with a headset for stenographers to listen and record conversations. In the corridor, naval personnel posted weather reports from the surface on cards in a fixed location, so that anyone wishing to leave the underground complex could know the outside weather conditions at any time.</p>
<h3>"Two-Plane Wing" Tactics Expert: Chennault in Kunming; Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's Kunming Correspondent, Zhang Jun</h3>
<p>"China's Lafayette"—General Chennault, bid farewell to China amidst enthusiastic farewells six months ago, and returned to Kunming amidst enthusiastic welcomes half a month ago. Although only one hundred and fifty days have passed from his departure to his return, many changes have taken place in the country he has served for eight years. On the morning of August 8, 1945, a drizzly morning, this Flying Tiger General boarded a special plane to return to his country, carrying the umbrella of "Meritorious Service in China" and the golden key engraved with the words "Chongqing." A reporter asked the General before his departure: "Will this trip be a farewell or a long parting?" The General hesitated for a moment before answering in a very frank tone: "I don't know yet what will happen, but time will tell." It is not difficult to understand the General's state of mind at this time. Those who saw him off at the airport in Kunming had their eyebrows hanging with drizzle, and their hearts seemed to have lost a close friend. When they waved their scarves to bid farewell to each other, they were especially reluctant.</p>
<h3>Newsboys Shout: "Read Chennault's News!"</h3>
<p>The good news of General Chennault's return to China suddenly spread throughout China in early January. People in Kunming have some selfish and optimistic views on this news. Some people say that General Chennault will train the air force in Kunming, and the unemployed don't have to worry about finding a way out. Some people speculate that the price of eggs in Kunming may not fall sharply. On January 18, the General arrived in Kunming from Chongqing. On the third day, newsboys shouted on the street: "Read Chennault's news!" Only then did the general public know that on the evening of January 19, military and political leaders of Yunnan warmly welcomed General Chennault at the Aowen Bank. The five hosts were Chairman Lu Yongheng, Commander-in-Chief Huo Songshan, and others.</p>
<p>General Chennault has lived in Kunming for most of his eight years in China. People here not only know about his past military achievements but also know his private life well. It is said that in his spare time, he likes sports, hunting, sometimes bridge, sometimes drinking, and his life is simple and his work and rest are regular. He does not pay much attention to personal security. The doors and windows of his bedroom are not locked at night. At midnight on January 25, a scholar broke into the General's bedroom, but fortunately, no incident occurred. In the past, when he was in Kunming, Chinese and American security personnel, fearing that unexpected incidents would occur, strengthened outdoor security and often secretly investigated nearby residents to prevent criminals from mixing in.</p>
<p>General Chennault is 56 years old this year and has been engaged in aviation work for more than 20 years. He came to China in 1937 and his hearing is not good due to too much flying. He is kind and sympathetic. The General never bombed the commercial and residential areas of Shanghai and Peiping with his air force. According to his old translator, he believes that Peiping is the essence of China and should be preserved as much as possible. Shanghai has too many people, and the result of bombing is inevitably inhumane.</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>Releasing Concerns for Foreign Companies</h3>
<p>— Sun Jiulu</p>
<p>Since the imminent victory of the War of Resistance, the relationship between our country and the United States has grown increasingly close. American officials and the public have not only provided military assistance to our struggle for final victory but have also declared their intention to assist us in completing post-war reconstruction economically. Consequently, the government decided on the first phase of economic construction principles in November of the year before last, announcing to both domestic and foreign parties that the operation of our country's economic construction endeavors must adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. This requires a planned implementation to gradually achieve the Three Principles of the People's economic system through the development of a planned free economy. Regarding operational methods, we should encourage private enterprises as much as possible without violating the principle of capital control. As for the utilization of foreign capital, it can be accepted based on the spirit of equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation, provided that it does not hinder sovereignty or the implementation of plans. The goal is to stimulate the development of economic enterprises through entrepreneurial freedom and complete the construction plan.</p>
<p>Based on these first-phase economic construction principles, many current commercial laws are no longer entirely applicable. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan began to research and revise them last year, starting with the Company Law, which serves as the basis for organizing all economic enterprises. Our Company Law, promulgated on December 26th, 1929, has been in effect for over fourteen years. Its content is based on European continental legal principles, adopting interventionism and strict controls, unlike American law, which takes a liberal approach to companies. In this era of international economic cooperation, it is naturally outdated. Furthermore, to encourage the concentration of national capital in production and to broaden the convenience of obtaining foreign capital for cooperation, it is necessary to lean slightly towards liberalism. In addition, the abolition of unequal treaties, the equal treatment of Chinese and foreign enterprises, and the equal treatment of government and private capital are all the main themes of this revision of the Company Law.</p>
<p>The Company Law has been revised five times during the process, which can be considered very careful. All opinions have been adopted under the principles of safeguarding our national sovereignty, developing our industry and commerce, and facilitating Chinese and foreign economic cooperation. It took five months to complete. Although it has not yet been promulgated by the government, both domestic and foreign parties have already grasped the general outline of the version passed by the Legislative Yuan in its third reading. However, some foreign business circles have expressed concerns about the requirement that foreign companies must establish and register in their home countries before they can establish branches in China. I would like to address these concerns for insightful friends from friendly nations.</p>
<p>Some believe that such a provision may hinder the investment and commercial development of friendly nations. It is true that American company law adopts liberalism, unlike our country's strict control over companies, but it provides greater legal convenience and tax reductions for companies operating in China. It should be noted that this is actually under the special protection of the "China Trade Act" promulgated in 1922. This act not only stipulates that companies operating in China do not need to have operations in their home countries but also simultaneously amends the tax laws, granting such companies operating in China all preferential rights. However, if they simultaneously conduct business in their home countries, they cannot enjoy this privilege. This act provided American merchants in China with significant benefits, allowing them to compete with merchants from other countries under the preferential conditions of tax reductions and exemptions. They were also protected by the consular jurisdiction at the time and were not subject to the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, making it impossible for Chinese industry and commerce to compete with them. As a result, those operating in China with strong financial resources undoubtedly reaped huge profits under the protection of this privilege. Even a few speculators with empty resources took advantage of this privilege to loot and leave. The incidents of the American-Feng Bank and the American-Feng Trust Company are the most prominent examples of this. All these facts have become historical relics. After the conclusion of equal new treaties between China and various countries, various laws are being revised to welcome foreign investment, in line with the spirit of equal opportunities and mutually beneficial cooperation in economics. Especially under the call of economic democracy by the great American President Roosevelt, insightful friends from our friendly nations should not stubbornly adhere to their traditional concepts of privilege and harbor doubts.</p>
<p>Some may say that such regulations will affect some foreign enterprises already existing in China. Please allow me to explain further. International trade begins with the exchange of goods. If country A transports and sells manufactured goods to country B, or country A needs to purchase certain manufacturing raw materials from country B, then companies in country A engaged in such businesses must request permission from country B to establish branches. There is no reason for them to have no business in their home country A but to operate such businesses out of thin air in country B. Therefore, any foreign company that already has operations in its home country can request permission from our government to establish branches in China. Moreover, according to international private law, the internal affairs of such companies can be handled according to their home country's laws. Those who have no business in their home country and only operate in China, except for individuals or commercial firms, can, of course, organize a company according to the Chinese Company Law. The revised Company Law does not restrict the nationality of any company's shareholders, nor does it specify the proportion of Chinese and foreign investment. Even if foreign capital accounts for 99%, it is still permissible. Since the shareholders of a company can be of any nationality, the equal treatment of Chinese and foreign capital is self-evident. Even when government capital is used as company capital, its rights and obligations are exactly the same as those of other shareholders. Secondly, except for the chairman of a limited liability company or a joint-stock company, or the director representing the company, who must be of Chinese nationality, any important positions within the company can be held by foreigners. As for the provision that half or more than half of the shareholders of an unlimited liability company or a limited liability company, and the directors of a joint-stock company, must have a domicile in the country, this is actually for the sake of sound company management, not to force any shareholder to have a domicile in the country. The Company Law has provided so much convenience for Chinese-foreign joint ventures to organize companies, so why can't foreign companies that have no business in their home country but only operate in China reorganize according to the revised Company Law? Let me give an example: The business of a news agency involves receiving and sending telegrams between two countries, which is international in nature. Any foreign news agency wishing to establish a branch in China naturally meets the conditions for a foreign company. If it independently establishes a newspaper office in China, it is reasonable to organize a Chinese company to operate according to the revised Company Law. For other industries such as banking and insurance, if they have operations in their home country and establish branches in our country, there is no question that they meet the conditions for a foreign company. If they have no business in their home country and operate solely in China, then based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, the Chinese government cannot allow them to absorb low-interest funds from our society without any supervision. They should be subject to the same treatment and management as Chinese banks and insurance companies, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past, many of our country's companies and firms would register in foreign countries without having operations there, and then enjoy foreign privileges to operate in China to evade the control of the Chinese government. This was called "hanging a foreign flag." There were countless companies and firms in major commercial ports relying on the protection of foreign privileges. The reasonable restrictions on foreign companies in the revised Company Law are precisely to crack down on Chinese people borrowing names and using foreign privileges to evade the management of the Chinese government. No country wants its citizens to evade legal and tax obligations, and this is no different for the Chinese government. Although Chinese people can also organize companies in foreign countries and then operate in China, if there are no special and superior conditions, then why bother doing so?</p>
<p>In short, the legislation of a country has its own objective environment as its basis. Even with the Company Law, the forty-eight states in the United States each have their differences. China, after the conclusion of equal new treaties, is in a time when Chinese-foreign economic cooperation is needed. We only seek equal opportunities for the development of our fragile industry and commerce. We sincerely accept all foreign investment to help us develop and build, without any intention of restricting it or treating it unequally from domestic capital. The provision in the revised Company Law that foreign companies must have operations in their home countries is merely to eliminate the vestiges of privileges from the era of unequal treaties and to restrict the erroneous concept of Chinese people borrowing names to evade legal and tax obligations. If foreign industries and businesses operating in our country do not have operations in their home countries, then unless it is for the sake of maintaining their traditional enjoyment of privileges, why not organize Chinese companies according to our revised Company Law? Moreover, our foreign-related legislation treats all friendly nations equally and cannot be designed solely for any one country. If any foreign industry and business operates in our country with a special and superior position, then our industries and businesses, which are weak in all conditions, will inevitably find it difficult to gain a foothold. This would be contrary to the original intention of equal opportunities and mutually beneficial cooperation in international economics, and even more so, it would deviate greatly from the economic democracy of the late American President Roosevelt.

<p>Chennault, the Flying Tiger General, Reputed After Eight Years in China</p>
<h3>Signing Autographs and Collecting Funds, Donating to Homeland Relief Association</h3>
<p>During General Chen's seven years in Kunming, many Chinese and foreigners asked him for autographs. The General had a set price for autographs, which was one US dollar per signature. A designated person was responsible for collecting and registering these funds. After the end of the month, a portion was sent to the United States to donate to wartime relief associations, and a portion was handed over to his old translator, Colonel Shu Boyan, who exchanged it for legal tender at the black market exchange rate of US dollars. The Central Bank of Kunming then remitted it to Chongqing free of charge to donate to our country's wartime children's welfare association. It is said that this income amounted to more than one hundred US dollars per month.</p>
<p>During his command in Kunming, the General created a new tactic, which was to use "two planes linked wings" for combat, which proved very effective. People in the American Air Force called it "Chennault's Pursuit Tactics 1" and he was also known as a "pursuit tactics expert." At the same time, the General was also experienced and interested in civil aviation. Therefore, in his several public speeches after returning to China, he particularly emphasized the development of China's civil aviation. He said: "In the future, civil aircraft should be as convenient and cheap as trains. China has transportation difficulties and should pay more attention to this. He is willing to do his best to assist China in carrying out this work."</p>
<p>"The Chinese Air Force has grown from infancy to maturity, and has been able to fight bravely and gradually build itself up, thanks in no small part to General Chen's assistance." (Words of Dean Long Yun) The people of Kunming have been with General Chen for seven years and know him well. Every holiday, they must express their condolences and respect to the General. General Chen once said: "I love China, especially Kunming." Perhaps one of the reasons is here.</p>
<h3>Startling News</h3>
<p>Half a month before Japan announced its surrender, startling news flew into China from beyond the Hump. On the afternoon of July 14th, 1945, the newly appointed Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces in the China Theater, Lieutenant General Stratemeyer, suddenly issued a statement at headquarters in Calcutta stating: "Due to the decision of Lieutenant General Chennault to retire, the U.S. Army Air Forces will lose an outstanding officer." The next day, General Chen announced in Kunming that he had requested Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to resign from his current active duty and prepare to retire from the U.S. Army. On the 16th, General Wedemeyer made a statement in Chongqing, first saying: "I accept General Chennault's request for resignation and express my deep regret." Finally, he said: "I would like to represent all American officers and soldiers in the China Theater in wishing him a safe and happy future."</p>
<p>After the news spread, his achievements were highly praised and regret was expressed for his resignation. The Yunnan Provincial Provisional Council first sent a letter of condolence and retention on July 16th, followed by the Kunming Chamber of Commerce. The Chongqing Political Participation Council also expressed the same sentiment on the 19th. However, the results were all in vain. On the afternoon of the 20th, General Chen held his last press conference in Kunming, first expressing his deep gratitude for the condolences and retentions from all walks of life. He then said that after this retirement, he would take his beloved dog and return home to live in seclusion.</p>
<h3>Farewell Gathering, The General Flies Away with Honors</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 26th, the Yunnan local community held a farewell gathering at the provincial party headquarters to bid farewell to General Chen. More than 300 people attended, including Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and Deputy Dean Zhou Wei-Yue. Although there was no dance party that night, there were old dramas such as "Eight Righteous Men" and "Water Floods Seven Armies" to add to the fun. On the evening of the 27th, the officers and soldiers of the Fourteenth Air Force Headquarters held a farewell party. General Chen held his last medal ceremony at the meeting, awarding medals of merit to three officers of the team. On July 28th, the General flew to Chongqing. Chairman Chiang immediately held a medal ceremony at 8 pm on the 30th, personally pinning the Blue Sky and White Sun Medal, our country's highest honor, on General Chen's left lapel. At 8 pm on August 2nd, 102 units from various agencies and groups in the capital held a grand farewell meeting for General Chen in the New Transport Model Area Plaza. Tens of thousands of people inside and outside the venue watched. Ms. Zhang Ai-Zhen, representing all circles in the capital, presented a specially made gift, including a couplet personally written by Dean Yu, which read: "Fighting for Freedom" and "Returning with Honors."</p>
<p>On August 3rd, Chen flew to Xi'an to visit the Northwest Air Force Base and say goodbye to the American Air Force soldiers. The next day, he flew to Chengdu, where Chairman Zhang Qun hosted a banquet at the Lishi Society and presented a silver tripod. Director Deng also presented a very valuable ancient porcelain teapot. On August 6th, the General flew from Chengdu to Kunming, and left Kunming on the morning of the 8th to return to the United States.</p>
<p>"China's Lafayette" revisited Kunming for two weeks and left Kunming on February 1st. The people of Kunming hope this is "goodbye" and not "fearful parting." Kunming, with a climate similar to Hollywood, is where the General indulged in hunting in his spare time. (Sent from Kunming on March 1st)</p>
<h3>Magnetic Mines, How to Sweep Them, Behind the Scenes of the War Stage</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Goodhew of the British Admiralty, Translated by the Translation Office of this newspaper</p>
<p>In his introduction to "Sweeping Magnetic Mines" (see the newspaper on the 1st of this month), Dr. Goodhew of the British Admiralty said: "The most prominent in technical warfare, a fierce battle, is the victory in radio, therefore, scientists and technicians must work behind the scenes of the war stage." This is a continuation of the previous article for readers' reference. (Editor)</p>
<p>German scientists have made many improvements on the old design. One method is to plan a clever clock that automatically measures on the spring and determines a force for placing the mine, a force necessary for the magnetic attraction force on the steel rod within the latitude line.</p>
<p>On that famous night of November 24, 1939, the analysis of the first German magnetic mine began. This analysis not only exposed its mechanical movement but also identified its technically correct outline: that is, the range of magnetic attraction needed to deploy the mine, and the duration of its effectiveness. If these steps could not be found, it would be very difficult to study countermeasures. That night, technical warriors all participated in the analysis.</p>
<p>After the entire story of this technical war was published, many plans were adopted and implemented. Many kinds were tested, they tied flounders to iron rods, airplanes tied with huge wire loops, and so on, in various ways. The first exploded mine caused extreme impulses. All methods, like a race, were repeatedly tested. Finally, a countermeasure was discovered, and the result of its application made the threat range of the mines much smaller than at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>This sweeping method uses two minesweepers at the same time, each with a long tail of self-floating seabed electric wire trailing from the stern, and the current is emitted from inside the ship, temporarily stored in the battery. This current passes through the submarine cable at the stern like a surging wave. The current passes through the electrodes and enters the sea water, and in this way, all magnetic mines under the sea of more than ten acres will explode. Two minesweepers advanced in parallel lines, continuing to deploy its second sweeping circle, and under such sweeping methods, the clearing line continued to extend, and a safe route was finally opened up in the English Channel.</p>
<p>On a cold winter night at the end of December 1939, two ships, each loaded with car batteries, dragging those "python"-like sweepers, sailed from the port of Heiness and began the first comprehensive planned test. This test confirmed the scientists' accurate calculations of the magnetic attraction range of the current entering the seabed.</p>
<p>That night, the British Admiralty issued an order to apply this great plan for one last improvement, while equipping ships and training personnel, these steps were all materials used in tests taken in advance before the anticipated success, and later replaced with self-floating submarine electric cables, designed and manufactured by Britain's two largest electric cable manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Company Registration in Recovered Areas, Regulations Have Been Stipulated, Enemy and Puppet Shares Should Be Reported for Confiscation, Increase Capital with Puppet Currency Converted into Legal Tender, Those Who Fail to Comply Will Be Dissolved and Liquidated</h3>
<p>The "Measures for Handling Company Registration in Recovered Areas" approved by the Executive Yuan have attracted considerable attention from the industrial and commercial circles in this city. The following are the main points:</p>
<p>Registration Method</p>
<p>(1) All types of companies in the recovered areas whose headquarters were once occupied shall submit their licenses and register with the economic authorities. (2) Licenses submitted that were issued by legitimate agencies in the past shall remain valid. After being stamped with a blue verification mark, they will be returned. If the licenses bear any annotations by the enemy or puppets, they shall be surrendered for replacement. (3) Licenses issued by puppet agencies shall be destroyed. Those who were previously registered and whose registration was altered by the enemy or puppets shall re-register the changes. Those who registered with the enemy or puppets shall re-register the establishment. (4) Joint-stock limited and joint-stock unlimited liability companies that need to re-register the changes shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year to resolve to ratify the changed registration matters and resolve all relevant issues during the occupation period. Enemy and puppet shares shall be reported for confiscation, and enemy and puppet personnel shall not be allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Capital Conversion</p>
<p>(5) If the company's capital has increased compared to the original registration, the originally registered capital shall still be listed at the original legal tender amount. Those that have been converted to puppet currency shall be restored to legal tender. Capital increased after the original registration, if calculated in legal tender, shall remain the same. If it is puppet currency, it shall be converted to legal tender at the statutory ratio. The property purchased after the capital increase shall be priced according to the proportion of legal tender and calculated based on the old and new shares. The share obtained by the new shares shall be the shares of the new shareholders, and the remainder shall be used as a reserve fund. (6) After the reorganization of the new and old shares, if the originally registered capital has a deficit, it shall be supplemented to the original capital amount or a resolution to reduce the capital shall be made. (7) After the reorganization of the new and old shares, if the new shares are more than twice as much as the old shares, the old shareholders must still occupy two-fifths of the seats on the board of directors and supervisors. (8) Unlimited liability companies and limited liability companies shall handle the change of registration in accordance with the above methods. However, when convening a shareholders' meeting, an unlimited liability company must have three-quarters of the shareholders present, and a limited liability company must have three-quarters of the unlimited liability shareholders and more than half of the limited liability shareholders present to be valid. (9) Those who do not submit their licenses for verification or do not re-register the changes in accordance with the regulations, the changed matters will not be recognized. (10) Companies that need to re-register the establishment, in the case of joint-stock limited and joint-stock unlimited liability companies, shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year as an inaugural meeting, pass the articles of association, elect directors and supervisors, and the directors and supervisors shall investigate the share payments and handle the establishment registration in accordance with the law. (11) All shares shall be calculated in legal tender. If they are paid in puppet currency, in addition to converting them into legal tender in accordance with the regulations, the property valuation provisions of these measures shall also be applied. (12) Unlimited liability companies and limited liability companies shall convene a meeting of capital-contributing shareholders before June of this year, re-establish the articles of association, and handle the establishment registration in accordance with the previous procedures.</p>
<p>Dissolution and Liquidation</p>
<p>(13) Those who do not submit their licenses for verification or re-register the establishment in accordance with the regulations shall be dissolved and liquidated. (14) Companies that were forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets, or cooperated with the enemy and puppets, or were managed and operated by the enemy and puppets shall be dealt with in accordance with the measures for dealing with enemy and puppet properties. If their shareholders have moved to the rear or can prove that they have not cooperated with the enemy and puppets, they shall still be allowed to exercise their shareholder rights. (15) Companies established in the recovered areas that have been registered to move to the rear during the occupation period shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year to resolve internal issues and change matters, and shall also handle the change of registration. (16) Companies established in the recovered areas that have suspended business or withdrawn shares during the occupation period but have not yet been approved for dissolution shall be registered by the legal directors and supervisors after reorganizing the original shares. If they no longer operate, they shall apply for dissolution and surrender the original license.</p>
<h3>Citywide Household Registration Check Begins on the 16th</h3>
<p>The organization of the baojia in this city has been completed in most sections after sectional compilation and inspection. According to the original plan, after the completion of the baojia organization, the household registration check will be continued. It is now learned that the preparatory work has been largely completed, and it has been decided that the household registration check will be started uniformly throughout the city on the 16th and completed on the 20th. At that time, the baojia chiefs in each district will stipulate the dates and times of the door-to-door investigation and notify each household, so that someone can wait at home to be checked and reported. In order to make it easier for citizens to identify them, all investigators will wear symbols or badges to prevent confusion and show prudence. It is expected that all the work, including the registration of citizens, can be completed by the beginning of March.</p>
<h3>High Court Continues Trial of Traitor; Gan Deyun's Sentence Undecided</h3>
<p>The case of Jiang Yougen, the traitor, along with Zuo Ming and Shen An, has been investigated multiple times. Yesterday morning, the High Court summoned witnesses again for a final investigation. During the War of Resistance, Jiang Yougen recruited 185 laborers for the Japanese San-kyu Company to build and repair ships for the enemy navy in the Philippines. According to workers who escaped and returned, "Jiang Yougen was not in charge of the recruitment." Witness Heitian Dingzao stated, "Upon the order of the Japanese Navy Department, I recruited workers and entrusted Jiang Yougen to handle it, paying him 10,000 yuan as remuneration." However, Jiang Yougen completely denied this. At this point, the court declared the investigation closed and will convene a meeting to adjudicate the case.</p>
<h3>Ten Years of Wrongful Imprisonment; Yang Wendao to be Released on Bail Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yang Wendao, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, who suffered ten years of wrongful imprisonment due to the case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, will walk out of the iron gates of Shanghai's Tilanqiao Prison safely this afternoon. Tang Huaiqun, Yang's pro bono lawyer, told reporters last night with extreme excitement that the Shanghai Prison had telephoned him, stating that the High Court had ruled that Yang Wendao could be released on bail for one million yuan in cash, but the ruling document would only be delivered this morning. Yang's son, Hanxiao, said he would find someone to post bail overnight so he could rush to Tilanqiao this morning to welcome his father. According to Yang Wendao, he told reporters in prison that after the victory, the prison authorities had specially allowed him to go out for a walk around the prison walls for a week, which was the first time in ten years that he had been allowed to breathe fresh air outside the prison. This afternoon, Yang Wendao will not only be reunited with his youngest son and grandson, whom he has never met, and his family, but will also see Shanghai for the first time after the Japanese surrendered.</p>
<p>Zhang Bingheng</p>
<p>Zhang Bingheng and his nephew, Zhang Yizhi, who ran the Yantai Copper-Tin Shop at 376 Huajing Road, were arrested on suspicion of buying copper coins for the enemy. Judge Liu simultaneously summoned witnesses Chen Chuantai and Zhou Guijun. However, they both answered "I don't know" to all questions. The court adjourned the trial for another day.</p>
<p>Gan Deyun</p>
<p>The trial of Gan Deyun, a Guangdong native (originally a British citizen named Gan Wei), began at 2 p.m. Gan once practiced law in Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, he joined a puppet organization and served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan. He was reported and arrested. The High Court has concluded the trial. The sentence was originally scheduled to be pronounced yesterday afternoon, but Gan's lawyers, Tang Huaiqun and Qin Shouzhang, argued that Gan was originally British, although he had joined the Chinese nationality, he had not obtained a naturalization certificate from the Ministry of Interior, so he could not be considered a Chinese citizen. Therefore, the crime of resisting his "own country" could not be established. They submitted a petition to the High Court requesting a dismissal. After the debate concluded, the case was scheduled for sentencing yesterday afternoon. Judge Cao Jun opened the court alone to announce the dismissal of the debate and scheduled a reopening of the debate. Defendant Gan Deyun requested bail. The court ruled to wait for a written application for further consideration.</p>
<p>Dong Jinfu</p>
<p>The case of Dong Yufu, a major secretary of the puppet 37th Army, accused of being a traitor, was also scheduled for judgment yesterday afternoon. Judge Cao temporarily announced a dismissal, ending the debate and scheduling a reopening of the joint court debate. Judge Cao then summoned Zou Zhigao, a technical official of the puppet Ministry of Justice Administration, and Wang Peisheng, a self-defense force instructor from the puppet Jinshan County. Both cases were adjourned for further trials.</p>
<h3>"Hai Xiang" Ship Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's sixth victory ship, renamed the "Hai Xiang," Captain Zhu Shaogang, was ordered yesterday morning to lead all crew members to receive it. All procedures and flag-changing, etc., were simple ceremonies and were completed by noon. The "Hai Zhong" Liberty ship is scheduled to be received today. This ship is the first Liberty ship to be handed over. The American ship "Huisi Fulakeshi," renamed "Hai Kang," has Captain Guan Pengling appointed, and will be received on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Production Quantity of All Yarn Factories Under China Textile Corporation Gradually Increases; Expansion to 500,000 Spindles Within One Month</h3>
<p>The twelve enemy yarn factories successively taken over by the China Textile Construction Corporation, namely Neiwai, Toyota, Nichiho, Shanghai, etc., initially had a total of just over 250,000 spindles open. Currently, production has exceeded 370,000 spindles and is expected to expand to around 500,000 spindles within one month. If transportation in cotton-producing areas in the Northwest and Henan is smooth, and there are no concerns about the supply of raw materials from home and abroad after the foreign exchange rate is announced, then production will be even greater. Currently, the factories can produce an average of 300 bales of yarn and 8,000 bolts of cloth per day.</p>
<p>Received Yarn and Cloth to be Sold at Low Prices Soon</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Council met yesterday morning. It was reported that the processing bureau received a large quantity of yarn and cloth stored by the puppet Sino-Japanese Trade Federation, and will sell a portion of it to the market at a low price. A large batch of Qingdao peanut oil arrived the other day and will also be sold by the bureau at a low price. It is also reported that three batches of tobacco leaves stored in Qingdao have arrived one after another, and will be supplied to all cigarette factories, which may have a positive impact on cigarette prices in the future.</p>
<h3>Technical Association Formed to Study Reasons for Telephone Disruptions</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of expansion of telephone exchanges in the city, citizens cannot install telephones, and those who have telephones often feel that calls are not smooth. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities consulted with the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, and each dispatched two senior technicians to form the Shanghai Municipal Telephone System Technical Committee. It is expected that a practical solution will be submitted to the relevant agencies for adoption by the end of May this year.</p>

<h3>US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Four Witnesses Testify; Lawyers for Plaintiff and Defendant Repeatedly Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The US Military War Crimes Tribunal, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, held its fifth trial of the eighteen Japanese war criminals who killed three American airmen in Hankou. Lieutenant Colonel Weisituo, representing the plaintiff, first cited witness Zhang Jiayuan to answer all questions.</p>
<p>Burning Bodies and Throwing Ashes into the Water</p>
<p>Zhang was originally the administrator of the crematorium of the Japanese Civil Regiment in Hankou, responsible for miscellaneous tasks. On December 16, 1944, he saw Japanese military police escort three American soldiers to the crematorium in a car. They were tied up. After the three were taken away, he noticed bloodstains on the ground. The Japanese military police also instructed him to light two cremation furnaces. The next morning, Japanese soldiers told him that "what was burned in the two furnaces was bad stuff" and ordered him to throw it into the water. Song Wenjin helped him shovel out the ashes and noticed that the ashes in furnace number one were more than those in furnace number two. The two then buried the ashes in the west garden, marking them. No one else knew. After the victory, when the US military authorities came to investigate, he informed them. Lieutenant Beici of the US Missing Persons Investigation Committee was also called to present the belt buckles, fingernails, and other documents left behind by the three American airmen as evidence.</p>
<p>Witnessed Various Crimes of Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The plaintiff's lawyer then called Song Wenjin as a witness again, describing how he accompanied US military authorities last autumn to point out the location where the ashes were buried and helped to move them out. He also proved that he was in the photographic photos presented by the plaintiff's lawyer at the time. He also testified about the experience of Zong Feiing, totaling seven pages, and personally saw Kato Takumi sign. After the questioning, Luo Jingwen, who used to work underground in Hankou and is now a detective in the Hankou Currency Inspection Bureau, was called as a witness.

One of the American soldiers was injured in the nose and covered in blood.</p>
<p>Unintentionally Confessed; Loud Laughter</p>
<p>He also pointed out that Japanese Sergeant Fujii Junichi, Sergeant Takeuchi Yoshiyuki, and Sergeant Tsukada Takayoshi were present in the courtyard at that time. The next witness was Kida Saburo, a police officer from the Japanese Consulate in Hankou, responsible for intelligence work. He also described the parade of the three British soldiers and said that he had seen Takeuchi Yoshiyuki beat the three. The plaintiff's lawyer ordered him to point out if there was anyone among the eighteen war criminals. When Kida was about to point, Takeuchi stood up first, causing loud laughter in the courtyard. The defendant's lawyer was helpless.</p>
<p>Rehearing to Be Held This Morning</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zhang then asked Major Mona Jia to prove that his investigation found that the organizational chart of the Japanese Sixth Army included the names of the responsible personnel of the 34th Army, which were several of the eighteen war criminals. Next, Lieutenant Colonel Endo, the liaison officer of the Japanese 34th Army, was called as a witness, saying that on December 15, 1944, he was informed by Kato Takumi that a parade would be held, and later heard that three American airmen had been killed.

<h3>Zheng Xigu Publishes Opinions on Shanghai Middle School Restoration Plan</h3>
<p>[Our city dispatch] Zheng Xigu, Principal of Provincial Shanghai Middle School, recently published the following opinions on the planning of the Shanghai Middle School restoration: Provincial Shanghai Middle School was established in 1927 through the reorganization of Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College and Provincial Second Normal School. The school was originally located in the Nanshi district of Shanghai and moved to Caohejing in the southern suburbs of Shanghai in 1934, where new school buildings were constructed. All buildings and facilities were gradually completed according to the latest standards. Libraries, science museums, gymnasiums, and other facilities were fully equipped. Student internship sites included banks, cooperatives, farms, and mechanical factories. The total school area was over 500 mu, with over 2,000 students. Over 90% of graduates in each class were admitted to science and engineering departments of national universities, making it one of the most complete middle schools in the country. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, it was first destroyed by the enemy, with over half of the school buildings damaged and the internal facilities completely gone. The magnificent buildings have become ruins, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is urgent to restore the old appearance. However, the repair of houses and the addition of equipment will cost more than 80 million yuan. At this time when recovery has just begun and resources are difficult to obtain, it is not easy to raise this huge amount of money at once. It has been decided to temporarily make do and make slight repairs in order to勉能start classes and lessons. This alone requires 170 million yuan. This time Tonghe returned to Shanghai specifically to raise funds for the restoration of the school, so that it can return to normal as soon as possible. In addition to applying to the government for funding, he is currently in consultation with various parties, intending to raise donations from the public and students' parents to provide support.</p>

<h3>Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<p>The greatest difference between men and women, of course, is that one is male and the other is female. This includes physiological differences and certain psychological differences arising from physiological differences, but I believe that this should be the only difference.</p>
<p>Historical artificiality and factual ruthlessness often lead people in society to hold preconceptions and prejudices about men and women, as if there were natural differences in ability, wisdom, and personality.</p>
<p>Humans live in a realistic cocoon. A person who neglects reality too much, occupying only time and losing space, is simply unable to live. But reality is ultimately sinful. A person who is overly realistic will only create sin.</p>
<p>I believe that the person with the deepest prejudice against men and women is the "sage" Confucius. His famous saying, "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," has been recited by all men for generations and is the greatest basis for all men to take a contemptuous attitude towards women.</p>
<p>In fact, or perhaps it is true that "only women and petty men, though raised," but putting women and petty men together, and saying that women and petty men are equally difficult to deal with, is artificiality of male society. It is a sinful marker manifested before people have truly become self-aware. Confucius's famous saying, "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," is a conclusion based solely on the errors of reality.</p>
<p>Why can't women do the same things as men, do men's jobs? This is entirely a matter of system. Men have always confined women to the home, always treating women as playthings, for thousands, tens of thousands of years. Therefore, once some men want to invite women to come into society, not treat them as playthings, they think that those men are deliberately teasing her, demanding her, and abusing her.</p>
<p>One day, suddenly there is a big change in the world, and all the things that were originally done by men are handed over to women, and all the things that women do are called men to do (except for having children). After a hundred years, a thousand years, see if it will still be: "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," I am afraid it will become: "Only men and petty men are difficult to deal with." From the question of men and women, to explore that people must truly become a person, they must overturn the case of history. Many other questions in society must also overturn the case of history to make them all reasonable.</p>
<p>If one wants to seek liberation, for people to talk about equality, then the first thing that should be thoroughly broken is the prejudice and preconceptions between men and women.</p>
<h3>Floating World</h3>
<p>— Xu Jiatang</p>
<p>The two words "floating world" are not good, because they sound a bit detached from the world, making people feel that this world is floating in a kind of ethereal desert, and has the same short and vague feeling as duckweed.</p>
<p>Well, despite being not good, it still often appears in the writings of literary people, because it is beautiful, because it is poetic. The two words contain endless emotion, and no longer need to be modified, no longer need to be carved, it is an extremely beautiful phrase.</p>
<p>In Japan, I heard that there is a very famous kind of ukiyo-e, I have not seen it, so I dare not comment. In China, I have seen people write things like "The Sadness of the Floating World" and "Scattered Notes on the Floating World." The people who write this kind of article have very beautiful writing, and there is a little bit of faint sorrow in the light and indifferent. In fact, this is a different starting point. If there is no "floating world," then sorrow may become anger.</p>
<p>For example, let's say: we depict a poor teacher, receiving his meager salary for a month from the school's accounting department, silently walking out, feeling a little self-pity in his heart. On the way, he hears a student say: "Recently, Mr. × is not putting in the effort." He says this lightly. This is a bit of "the sadness of the floating world," but what good does it do? The poor teacher still silently takes that pitiful salary, teaching listlessly. For the person writing the article, it is inevitable that there is a bit of "the sadness of the floating world."</p>
<p>People are somewhat fond of playing with emotions! Anything that can bring him a little vastness, a little bit of slight sorrow, he will grab hard, commenting that it has a sense of beauty. Because it just lets his tears turn in his eyes, without flowing down, without wailing. As for what role these tears play? He does not think about it, nor need he think about it. This way, he is somewhat fond of the two words "floating world." But he loves it too passively, without turning to look at the back. On the back there is a mirror. Looking at the back, you see: you complain that this world is too ethereal, too short, but in fact, in these light tears, you have already wasted the shortness of this floating world.</p>
<p>If we have lived on barren soil, and if we really like the two beautiful words "floating world," we can describe the extremely beautiful "sadness of the floating world" in the three words "household rice." However, it is somewhat too detached from reality. We have to anticipate what is behind the three words "household rice." There is also a mirror there: it is the anger of being a slave.</p>
<p>Gentlemen who pay attention to aesthetics all like this, willing to search out a sense of joy in tragedy, saying that people are so cruel. I have a silly idea, thinking that these gentlemen are not only fond of playing with emotions, but mostly also a bit fond of playing with words, right?</p>
<p>I myself have such a narrow view. In fact, I don't feel ill will towards the gentlemen who write things like "The Sadness of the Floating World" and "Scattered Notes on the Floating World." However, there is one opinion that I must express, feeling that life is too difficult now, paper is very expensive. These beautifully decorated words are not necessarily useless, but we have to wait until after the reign is peaceful before we talk about them. As for now, it seems that we are still in a chaotic world, the days are short, we must not waste ourselves and then waste others. So, floating world, etc…</p>
<p>We still have to wait a few days before we have the time to fill in lyrics.</p>
<h3>Ode to Purple</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>I once loved the delicate red of the morning glow. In the beautiful childhood of the morning glow, therefore, to this day, there are still a few innocent and unforgettable old dreams hidden in that fragrant peach forest...</p>
<p>Later, I gradually came to like the quiet blue color. Blue skies and blue sea water were often praised by me. I even prayed that there would be a blue angel, applying some light and pale micro-blue to the green leaves and red flowers. I looked forward to there being a lovely blue kingdom in the absolutely beautiful world of nature.</p>
<p>I don't know when I suddenly felt the loveliness of purple, this beautiful and sad color, like a lyrical music boy, the setting sun at dusk, a Western oil painting covered with dust, a beautiful woman as gorgeous as peach blossoms and as cold as ice, constantly calling out "Better to Return" like a cuckoo.</p>
<p>The purple redbud tree, the purple lilac, the light purple radish flower… Golden dreams come true, but why doesn’t the almighty creator let every tulip flower also turn purple? I always feel that only purple is worthy of this flower with the name of a tulip.</p>
<p>If I had that magical magic ring from the "Arabian Nights," then just a never-fading, rich purple tulip would satisfy my current desire.</p>
<h3>Inscription on Painting of Oranges</h3>
<p>Chen Zhongtao</p>
<p>The sleeves are completely without trace. Heavenly flowers fall and fly. Skillful in poetry, capable of being unrestrained. Understands the law, revealing profundity. The moon is missing, the sparse wutong is quiet. The transverse stars are cold, the pistil is plump. Stringed zither,　heart appreciation. Mountains and rivers are full of pure brilliance.</p>
<p>The four seas fill heavenly will. I hum and gaze at this cup. Holding a brush to pursue Chu's splendor. Stroking the event, feeling Qin's ashes. Double well country fragrance praise. Dong'a Luo fu talent. Night light can illuminate the ride. Throw into the dark or startle suspicion.</p>
<p>Happy feelings follow dreams shallow. Poetic mood enters spring and revives. Old swallows are like acquaintances. Secluded birds understand and call themselves. Good deviation from worldly affairs illusion. Dwelling in solitude, the guest's heart is lonely. Falling　intentions. Does the world understand?</p>
<h3>Double Flight (13)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Old Man Weng laughed again!</p>
<p>"Haha... a newborn baby invariably 'coos' for a while. Crying is that sound, laughing is that sound; singing is that sound, shouting is that sound; how can you determine that she is crying to you? Maybe she's smiling at you; singing to you; shouting to you!"</p>
<p>Old Man Weng's words left Old Man Mo speechless. He pondered for a while and felt that Old Man Weng's explanation made a lot of sense. So he turned his sorrow into joy and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Indeed, you are smarter than I am! I couldn't figure it out this morning, and the more I thought about it, the more confused I became, simply unbearably annoyed. Now, after your explanation, I suddenly understand! However, I dreamed that the boat I was on was sunk by wind and waves, which is probably not very auspicious, right? And that inexplicable leaflet, the piece of reform theory on the leaflet—"</p>
<p>Although Old Man Mo got an answer to his question about the birds, he remembered the shipwreck and the words on the sudden leaflet, and he couldn't help but feel worried again.</p>
<p>Old Man Weng felt that the latter two problems were even less worthy of consideration. He said:</p>
<p>"You took a boat to a place upstream on the Yangtze River, which of course means returning to Jingzhou! But you stubbornly turned around and went downstream, your intention being to go to Beijing again. However, the imperial family in Beijing has been overthrown by reformers and revolutionaries, which is why we are in this state! So the wind and waves are a metaphor for the reformers, and the sunken boat is a metaphor for our present situation. Brother, I advise you to think it through! Don't keep dwelling on the past, dwelling on it too much will give you nightmares. We are old, why are we still dreaming?" Old Man Weng was also a little sad at the end. His meaning was double-edged. He was advising Old Man Mo not to dream anymore, which was also advising Old Man Mo not to have any more superfluous fantasies.</p>
<p>Old Man Weng's earnest advice aroused Old Man Mo's infinite sorrow. Old Man Mo understood Old Man Weng's meaning, so he drained a glass of wine and said melancholically:</p>
<p>"I haven't thought about anything for a long time, I only hope to close my eyes soon! Living to this state, it's better to die quickly!" As he said this, Old Man Mo's eyes were a little wet. If he hadn't been afraid of being laughed at by Old Man Weng, he really wanted to cry.</p>
<p>"Hehe!" Old Man Weng chuckled twice from his nose, then took a puff of his cigarette and said, "It's better to be alive than dead. I'm not as bookish as you are! In this day and age, you can't take things too seriously, just live one day at a time. Drink today's wine today, smoke today's cigarette today!"</p>

<p>How to Embark on the Path of Light Editor: We are all young people with occupations, but we feel that society is too dark. Please give us some guidance on how to embark on the path of light. Readers: Cai Yan, Wang Ying, Ding He, Zou Bin, Fan Qing, Gu Qiu, Same as above.</p>
<p>(Answer) Thank you all for your kindness in asking me to point out the path of light. This question is indeed too broad to be answered in a few words. I hope that you all will do your best in your respective roles, always with a kind heart, to persuade people to improve and encourage them to walk towards the bright road, seizing opportunities and doing your best. If everyone can persuade each other and strive for progress, in the long run, there will be results. If it is said that society is dark, everyone has a responsibility, and no one can be blamed. In other words, to lead people to the path of light, we must work together and catch up head-on. Do you all agree?</p>
<p>Examination for Government-Funded Students to Study in the UK and the US Having read your newspaper's special dispatch from Chongqing on the 8th, the Ministry of Education will hold an examination for government-funded students to study in the UK and the US in May, selecting approximately one thousand students. I would like to know the qualifications for this examination, the subjects to be tested, and the registration locations, etc. Please provide detailed information so that I may follow the instructions. Respectfully, Zhang Xingjian.</p>
<p>(Answer) The examination will be held in May, so the points you inquired about have not yet reached the announcement stage. Please pay attention to the education news in this newspaper in the future, and you will understand.</p>
<p>I used to live in Zhabei, but due to the outbreak of the war, I was forced to move. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the land has been restored, I would very much like to move back. However, the house was occupied by others during the period of occupation. I don't know what procedures I can follow to achieve my goal. Hua Zhixian.</p>
<p>(Answer) You were forced to move during the war. You can negotiate to recover the house based on the original lease contract. Please apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee at the south end of the Sichuan Road Bridge.</p>
