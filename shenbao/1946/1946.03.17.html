<p>〔又電〕據此間報紙稱：陳立夫有被任爲內政部長之說，內政郃長在改組之政府中，將爲權力强大之職位，因行政院長在假時，中其代行職權。</p>

<h3>循民主政治方針　樹現代國家常軌　全會通過政治報告決議案</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕二中全會十七次大會通過政治報告決議案，全文如次：一中全會以後，日本無條件投降，國內外情勢發生重大之變化，政府爲勝利與和平而訂立中蘇條約，復鑒於和平雄國之必要，召集政治協商會議，此實本黨歷史上之一重大時期。本大會檢討行政院之全部工作報告及一中全會以來之施政成績以後，認爲行政院之工作，實未能滿足此一重大時期之要求，此其原因，固非一端。而政府對於六全大會所定政策，執行不力，尤以財政經濟多所貽誤，均無可諱言，除外交，政治協商，財政，經濟諸端，另有決議外，茲綜合大會之檢討提案與討論，對一般行政工作，提出檢討及革新之要點於左：</p>
<p>「檢討部份」</p>
<p>（一）多年以來，官商主義，早已構成政治上最大弊害，而以敷衍塞責，假公濟私爲尤甚。結果所至，官吏不知責任爲何物，對於主義政策，不知尊重。此種弊害，在勝利以後，尤完全暴露，復員時期各種工作，多無準備。而一部份接收人員，敗破法紀，喪失民心，均為平素漠視主義，不知尊重國家制度之結果。此大會深表痛心，所欲政府力求改正者，公敎人員及軍警待遇不合理，爲年來效率低下，紀綱廢弛之一大原因，六全大會對此，已有鄭重決定，而政府仍漫不注意，今後必須切實解決。</p>
<p>（二）機構之龐大繁複，與法令之紛歧異見，以致權責不清，减低效能，亟應調整，分別存廢</p>
<p>（三）人事與政策之不相配合，爲政治上一畸形現象，政務官與事務官之無區別，政務官不知其應該執行之政策，事務官之進退，未能悉按條例，以致責任觀念薄弱，陷政府於無能。</p>
<p>（四）地方自治，爲訓政中心工作，歷次大會均鄭重決議，而若干年來，政府未能切實執行，以致今日憲政實施在即之時，地方自治，仍無基礎。</p>
<p>「改進辦法」</p>
<p>關於政制之革新</p>
<p>（甲）關於政制之革新者，欲謀政治之進步，必須在政制上，政策上，人事上，亟謀改革，循民主政治之方針，樹立現代國家之常軌。在制度方面，必須簡化機構，分明權責，貫澈分層負責之精神，而樹立健全之文官制度，黨外人士之參加政府組織，應不得本黨對全國行政機構爲合理有效之革新，其要點如左：</p>
<p>（一）國民政府爲決定國務之最高機關，過去所有國防最高委員會之設計局，考核委員會及各專門委員會，應予裁併。</p>
<p>（二）行政院各部會署，應依其職常，爲合理調整與劃分，務使名實相符，權責分明，駢枝悉裁，冗員必汰，還都以後，更分期縮减中央人員，以充實地方人力，惟編餘人員，須另謀任用及轉業之道。</p>
<p>（三）軍民分治，爲現代國家常軌，現役軍人，不宜兼任民政職務，所有涉及軍事供應問題，軍事機關應通過民政機關辦理。</p>
<p>（四）警察爲法治工具，今後必須提高警察素質及待遇，樹立健全之警察制</p>
<p>（五）修明政治，必須樹立健全之人才制度：一，政務官必對其政策負責，政策失敗，執行不力，必須課以責任。二，事務官必須久於其職，政府必須擢用人才，根絕任用私人之惡習，並宜實行定期異動，以資歷練。至於待遇之改善，凡假制，年金制，養老金制，均須切實規定，爲實行健全之人才制度，除涉及國家之預算外，目前考試院及各機關之人事室，其權責連繫，亦必有系統之調整。</p>
<p>關於政策之力行</p>
<p>（乙）關於政策之力行者，本黨歷届大會之政策，無不正確，政績之不良，非政策之有誤，實由執行之不力，或執行之時發生曲解而已。六全大會所決定之政綱，仍爲今後施政之準繩，至於政治協商會議所決定之和平建國綱領，大體上亦與本黨政策相符，自宜領導各黨派，促其實現。唯鑒於目前內外情勢，本大會認爲外而保全國權，內而修明吏治，安定民生，尤爲當前施政之根本。而確保國家之統一團結，保障人民權利，肅淸官僚主義，官僚資本，爲修明吏治之前提，積極恢復交通與秩序，以謀恢復生產，充裕物資，則又爲安定民生之前提，特鄭重提示當前應予立即實施之事項如左：</p>
<p>（一）根據保持領土主權完整之原則，及維護國際和平條約之決心，以諜中蘇之眞正親善。</p>
<p>（二）調整邊疆政府，並儘量引用邊胞參加中央及地方之行政，以貫澈本黨之邊疆政策。</p>
<p>（三）切實實行整軍建軍方案，並督促共黨履行協定，以達軍隊國家化之目的。</p>
<p>（四）各級政府，未得各級民意機關之同意及上級政府之批准，不得擅立單</p>
<p>（六）人民因戰爭所受之損害，政府應從速調查，訂定賠價辦法。</p>
<p>（七）收復區所有接收之工廠，礦塲，應限期恢復生產，同時應積極開創新業，首先安插復員官兵及抗戰有功之公敎人員，並發動全國人力，從事地方生產事業及各種公共工程之建設。</p>
<p>（八）即刻規定耕者有其田之實施步驟及辦法，由政府發行土地債券，收購大地主土地，分配於退伍士兵及貧農，並切實扶植自耕農，保護佃農，都市土地應按報價征稅，漲價歸公及照價收置等辦法，迅速推行有效之農貸，以安定農村。</p>
<p>（九）淸查戰時暴利者之財富，課以重稅，淸查不法接收人員之贜產，並進行征借巨富之資財及外匯，尤嚴格推行適度合理累進所得稅制。</p>
<p>（十）在外交上保護僑胞之財產，在經濟上扶助僑胞之事業。</p>
<p>（十一）切實提高公敎人員及軍警之待</p>
<p>（十二）水利委員會應切實擬定計劃，積極進行治河，治江事宜，以防止可能之水災。</p>
<p>（十三）舉行全國戶籍及財產總登記。</p>
<p>關於人事之革新</p>
<p>（丙）關於人事革新者，有制度，有政策，如無健全之人事，政治革新仍托空言，今日政治之弊端，半在制度，半在人事，茲提出人事革新要點如左：</p>
<p>（一）因附逆及貪汚而受制裁或逃脫法網者，均永不得任用。</p>
<p>（二）凡任職無成績者，應予更換。</p>
<p>（三）統計接收人員貪汚案件，有關最多之主管官，立即免職。</p>
<p>（四）用人不可偏重歷史關係，感情關係，一以才能為標準。</p>
<p>（五）政務官須以對於政策有認識與執行能力者爲標準。</p>
<p>（六）內容，或舉行特別考試，以爲登用之標準。</p>
<p>（七）一人一職，非確有必要，不得兼職。以上建議三大項目，均係就目前即須執行者而言，本大會深望政府鑒於國內外危機之嚴重，深明厥職，罪勉奉公，勿再視爲具文，至深企盼。（完）</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日急電〕重慶訊，國軍掌握瀋陽後，波話雲詭之東北局勢，漸見明朗，舉世焦慮在東北土地上發生之勝利品問題，經濟合作問題，將於畏哈蘇軍續撤後，重開談判之門，已可於下列諸訊中，露出曙光。（一）中美均傳東北問題，不擬向聯合國大會提出。（二）華盛頓與重慶間，重慶與莫斯科間，有關解決柬北問題之非正式外交活動，將以蔣主席所示「必須蘇軍撤出東北再談經濟合作」之嚴正聲明爲根據，已無疑問，因東北蘇軍已開始撤退。（三）重慶外交界人士，深體中國政府維護世界和平保持中蘇邦交之苦心，並讚美主席之聲明，持重切實無碍友邦體面，雖蘇聯亦有同感。（四）蔣主席之聲明，不啻暗示有關東北勝利品問題，東北中蘇經濟合作問題，可能分別解決·即前者應留待同盟國從長計議，共同商決，後者應依據中蘇協定，實踐前議，推誠合作。（五）今晨京中盛傳在渝東北大員，有於短期內逕飛東北之準備，同時透露東北若干旅渝賢達，將應邀返鄉，協助政府，撫輯流亡，監督接收，綜此以觀，中蘇爭端，將於淸明節前獲得淸楚明白之解決方案，誠可樂觀。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十六日電〕與國民黨接近人士傳出消息稱，蘇聯將利用東北爲抵押品，俾與美國折衝。就各種徵象觀之，如果美國願以原子彈秘密告知蘇方，並貸予鉅款，更作某某數種讓步，如允蘇方在韓國設立陸海空根據地等，俾蘇聯得在遠東確保安全，則蘇方準備從東北撤軍，並予國民政府以便利，得在東北完全恢復主權。如果美國加以拒絕，則蘇方將一再推託，繼續駐軍東北，以待中共獲得堅强控制權，樹立「自治政權」，實行蘇維埃化。關於此點，蘇方已與中共討論「滿洲蘇維埃」計劃，囑中共在東北發動「自治」政府，藉以控制東北，阻止國府官員推進行政。按照是項計劃，「自治」政權將受中共指揮，蘇方則將協助編成一支强大軍隊。蘇方此等行動，意欲防止美國在遠東樹立「防綫」。</p>

<h3>年俸八千鎊　請邱翁著書</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕晚報今日載稱：戰時首相邱吉爾自美回國後，即將辭去保守黨總裁一職。邱氏退休後，已有出版家擬以年俸八千鎊，請其撰述戰時回憶錄。</p>
<h3>紐約歡迎宴席上　邱吉爾演說　蘇對伊土施用壓力　安理會應即予處理</h3>
<p>否認曾主張訂立英美同盟</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十五日電〕英國戰時首相邱吉爾，今晚在此間華爾道夫阿斯多里飯店歡迎宴發表演說。在座者有十九國大使，伊如大使亦在內，惟蘇聯並未參加。演說前後均有人游行示威，噓噓聲與歡呼聲雜作，邱吉爾作Ｖ字勝利符號，於鼓掌聲中揮手微笑。示威者有人携帶招貼，上書「英國踢出邱吉爾，美國拒絕邱吉爾」！並高呼「邱吉爾要戰爭，我們要和平」！</p>
<p>邱氏演說主張聯合國機構安全理事會應處理蘇聯不撤退伊朗駐軍問題，蘇聯如繼續對土施用壓力，並應要求安全理事會對韃靼尼爾海峽問題宣布判決。美英兩國在波茨坦會議中曾向蘇聯提議聯合保證韃靼尼爾海峽於平時及戰時之完全自由，此在土耳其亦必樂於接受，惟蘇聯認爲不足，是爲波茨坦三巨頭會議中關於韃靼尼爾海峽問題談話之第一次公開宣布。</p>
<p>邱氏論及英美關係時宣稱，予從未請英美訂立軍事同盟或軍事條約，予僅請其作親如手足之聯合，並爲一自由自主之友愛聯合，我兩國之日益接近，無可阻止，兩國之和衷共濟，爲維持世界和平與人類親善之主要希望，此一事實亦不容抹煞。予不信戰爭不可避免或已迫在眉睫，予不信蘇聯統治者欲於此時開戰，英美各國對蘇聯人民普遍表示同情，蘇聯政府若不能利用此種感情，而反使人失望沮喪，其責任將全在彼等。</p>
<p>蘇聯因戰爭之努力而感覺報酬不足，要無理由，彼之損失雖可悲憫，然其所獲亦已大有可觀。德日二國爲蘇聯之兩大仇敵，均已打倒。日本幾完全由美國一手擊敗，蘇聯幾於不費一兵而盡復共四十年前之失地。在西方則波羅的海各國與芬蘭之大部份均已併入蘇聯版圖。寇松界綫亦已不成問題。</p>
<p>予在此自由國內被請自由發表意見，予確知在上次演說中所表示增進兩國友誼之希望，必能實現，非因任何演說所致，乃因人事潮流及命運之趨勢使然。十日以來局勢已大爲改觀，有急轉直下之勢今人無從測度，俟予歸國以後，或將再就新局勢發表演說。至於日來之事，頗多誤會，此言予完全同意。予熱誠希望蘇聯平安昌盛，在世界機構中佔榮譽地位，絕不因此稍减。蘇聯是否能如是，僅恃乎少數幹練人物在其著名領袖指導下所作之決定。</p>
<p>邱氏曾於演說中提及其在米蘇里州富爾敦鎭之演說，謂決不願將其撤回或更易一辭。</p>
<p>紐約曾有反邱示威</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕邱吉尔昨在此间遊歷时，百老匯路曾發現「美國無人願爲邱吉爾而死，」及「不願有第三次世界大戰」等招貼。市政應前有反邱吉爾示威運動，與警察發生衝突，二十人被捕。警察佔計示威羣衆內約有一千人爲共產黨人，當時並曾散發「邱吉要汝等之子孫」之傳單。</p>
<h3>英美保持密切聯絡　謀澄清緊張局勢　馬歇爾或充特使赴蘇</h3>

<h3>星期論壇　建「省」商兌</h3>
<p>— 陶啟沃</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>集數萬人爲一軍，則必編為若干師，師分爲若干旅，旅分爲若十團，團以下又分編營，連，排，班，必俟秩序井然，系統分明，方能統制管理，運用作戰，非然者，則爲一羣烏合之衆，不能成軍，行政機構之施政牧民亦如此，治權之下中央政府以次，復有上級行政區，中級行政區，以至下級行政區之分劃，藉便推行庶政，使綱舉目張，法立令行，用臻治理，本文所說的「省」，便是上級行政區之一環。</p>
<p>硏究「　」這個問題，重點有二，一是「省區域」，就是確定「省」空間地位，規定其行使職權的範疇，二是「省制度」，就是規定在一定區域以內，應如何行使其職權，兩者相五關聯，具有不可分件。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>地方行政區域分劃原則，有須尊重歷史成分，一國之內，各地方人民團體，都有特別信仰語言，風俗習慣，經濟關係與生活，歷史久了，逐漸成爲一種自然結合，像一個有機體，倘使强風俗習慣語言信仰都不相同，與無經濟關係等團體並而爲一，或强將相同以及互有密切關係者分劃爲二，皆足以毀損上項有機體的結合，使失去合作自治精神，其次，則為謀施政方便，要考慮天然地理形勢，人口疎密多寡，文化程度，交通情形，爲適當的區劃。</p>
<p>我國現行省區，無疑的是違反了以上二原則，例如江蘇的江南江北，人民生活語言經濟狀况，均不相同，却强使二者合爲一省，又如陝西省的秦嶺南北，交通艱阻，併成一省，施政極不方便，當時異族統治，爲牽就軍事形勢，便於控制，故意違背歷史感情與地理環境，弄得混同錯綜，犬牙交錯，自應重加分劃，予以糾正。</p>
<p>此外，現行「省」區太大，施政不便，利於割據，妨碍統一，所以還要注意縮小區域，使全省人民空間距離縮小，接觸密，交換意見參與公共活動機會多，政治智識能力容易增長，自治興趣與責任心容易培義，此點尤爲將來建「省」重心所在。</p>
<p>基於以上理由，省區要於縮小原則下，並糾正上述與歷史感情地理環境相背的不合理現象，最簡單方法，莫如就現在省區，再依據歷史沿革，地理形勢，文化交通經濟狀况加以分劃，於此，本人相當贊同張其昀敎授的主張，除東北九省已重新劃分不再調整外，本部各省，如河北，山西，陝西，江蘇，安徵，江四，福建，廣西，貴州，可就東西山脈河流分劃南北二省，山東，河南，甘肅，浙江，湖北，湖南，四川，廣東，雲南，則可就東西剖分兩省，（詳張其昀最近在重慶大公報發表之論文，本文不擬詳加討論）至於熱，察，綏，靑，康，新，寗，各省，我認爲應暫維現狀，俟地方安定，社會進步，再求調整。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>區域僅僅是軀殼，制度才是靈魂，如果只是省區縮小，而省制無所改進，「省自治地位不能確立，則在現行制度之下，省政樣樣須中央主持照顧，以中國區域之大，中央而臨百十地方單位；其遼遠之區·統制管理，必有困難，於是不免又設置省以上監督機關，成爲變相大省區之復活，正如唐代之縮小州區，又發生州以上道區相同，所以爲期求縮小省區，能發生良好效果起見，必須輔以分省自治制度之樹立，按建國大綱第十六條：規定「凡一省全數之縣，皆達完全自治者則爲憲政開始時期，國民代表會後選舉省長，爲本省自治監督，至於該省內之國家行政，則省長受中央之指揮」，最近政治協商會議決議之地方行政制度，亦擬確定「省」爲地方自治最高單位，現代民主國家，其上級地方行政區，都有相當的自治組織，所以要使省制健全，最重要一點，還在培養全省人民自治興趣與責任心，扶植並發揮其有機性，「省」確認爲地方自治單位後，則省參議會職權應予擴大，至少包括：（一）省預算通過權，（二）省單行規章立法權，複決權，（三）省稅省公債議決權，（四）省自治經費募集決議權，（五）省官吏罷免糾舉權，（六）省長遴選權，（七）省政興革建議權（僅僅現在的聽取報告諮詢質問權是不够的）</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>「分省自治」除了要有民選參議會，民選省長以外，尚須其有三個條件：第一，要有自治財政，財政爲庶政之母，沒有自治財政，什麽自治事業都不舉辦，所謂自治，將成徒託空言。</p>
<p>民國三十年十一月，國府公布改訂財政收支系統實施綱要，規定全國財政收支，分爲國家財政與自治財政二系統，自後省之一級，遂無財源，一切均由中央支配，其應有之事權，亦須俟中央政府隨時分配，而不復固定，有一舉一動，辦一事一物，均須仰賴國庫支撥款項，在此種情形之下，使省當局變成無事可做，或要做事而無的款，於是不免有非法稅捐（如戰時各省徵收貨物通過稅）或移挪縣自治經費情事發生，過去戰時，政府爲充裕軍糧民食，將田賦收歸中央，並因勢利便，廢除『省級財政」自屬適時之舉，現在戰事結束，全面復員，不久省自治地位被確認，「省級財政」且仍應恢復，其財源約如下述：</p>
<p>（一）課稅收人（包括田賦，土地改良物稅，屠宰稅，營業牌照稅，使用牌照稅，行爲取締稅，土地稅），（二）特賦收入，（三）懲罰賠償收入，（四）規費收入，（五）信託管理收入，（六）財產及權利收入，（七）省有事業收入，（八）省有營業盈餘收入。（九）補助收入，（十）財產及權利售價收人，（十一）省公債收入。</p>
<p>以上省財政收入與其所屬縣市分配此例，應由省參議會決議規定，中央委辦事項所需經費，由國庫另行撥付。</p>

<h3>珠聯璧合雙喜臨門　杜月笙兩公子婚禮誌盛</h3>
<p>泰興路汽車　接　形成一字長蛇陣　麗都花園熱鬧空前　〔本報特寫〕杜月笙氏昨假座泰興路麗都花園，為其五公子維翰六公子維寗同時舉行婚禮。預定下午三時行禮，記者在二時左右趨車趕到。泰興路上汽車，已接成長蛇陣，挨次開進入口處，吐出了它所裝的主人，又挨次的離開出口處，循環不息，人力車三輪車竟不能覓隙而入。</p>
<p>禮堂門口密密層層站滿了招待人員，好容易擠到簽名處，寫上了姓名，領到了一枚金色的盾狀喜章，一小包香烟，就趕着進禮堂。只聽得門口的人喊着，快把喜章釘上衣襟，否則是要被拒絕入塲的。賀客一個個的照辦，前擁後擠的跨進了禮堂。　少不得來一個全塲巡禮，才知道主人杜月笙氏因病沒有來，一切由他的長公子維藩替代了。</p>
<p>禮堂裏只覺得黑壓壓的都是人頭。每個可坐的座位都給佔了，每個優勢的間隙都給塞滿了，可是不盡賀客滾滾來，男女老幼軍政工商……各界人士，免不了都趨向禮台行三鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>花籃砌滿了禮台的兩側，喜幛層疊，補綴滿了禮堂每人壁角，禮台的正中，高掛着蔣主席致送的醫字紅幛，左右鑲綴了宋子文，于右任，孫科，何應欽，居正，戴傳賢，孔祥熙，錢大鈞……等國府要員的名字。禮台上金盾，銀鼎，高塔，方框，一級級的層積起來，活像一座金銀山，和牆上的金字紅幛，交織成一幕炫耀奪目的背景。中央電影攝製塲，在禮堂的四角，安置了八盞龐大的水銀燈，八道强烈光綫，分洒在禮台上，新郞新娘的走道上。開麥拉高高地矗立在禮台的左角，鏡頭瞄準着禮台。十幾個中外的攝影記者，擎着鏡箱，忙着找適當的地位。</p>
<p>將近三點鐘的時候，證婚人錢大鈞，介紹人黃金榮，金廷蓀等，陸續出現。司儀唐纘之在話筒裏高唱婚禮開始，在主婚人，證婚人，介紹人等就席後，婚禮進行曲開始演奏起來。</p>
<p>新郞維翰維寗兩人，隨即高視闊步的踏進了禮堂，出現在禮台的面前。他倆都穿着玄黑的禮服，熨貼平整，身材都顯得相當的肥胖，其中以維翰較矮，接着新娘嚴仁芸和陳慶珍，隨着六個獻花小天使而出現了。她倆都有人挽伴着，穿着純白的緞禮服，頭上都戴了珠花，頭紗掛到地上，輕盈地緩步到禮台前，兩對新人，開始拼凑成整齊的一排。攝影記者開始總動員，銀光閃閃，競留這彌足珍貴的一頁。</p>
<p>錢市長高揚着嗓子宣讀結婚證書，新郞新娘交換着飾物，親自蓋章，主婚人，證婚人，介紹人等一一的用印，一步步的手續，進行得相當敏捷而純熟。接着錢市長致詞，他說；今天杜月笙先生兩公子同時舉行婚禮，眞可說是雙喜臨門。然而結婚不僅是為生育子女，更為的是求生活的美滿，和求事業的進步。好在兩對新人都有完滿的敎育，將來必能互愛互助，儷福無窮。</p>
<p>這時候，全禮堂裏人氣沸騰，溫度極高，錢市長詞畢時，已滿頭大汗，忙着用手巾抹拭。繼由來賓徐寄廎致祝詞。最後由主婚人杜維藩代表他的尊人向主持婚儀各位和來賓們致謝。婚禮在新郞新娘們對向的鞠躬聲中，穴吿完成，台下起了一陣騷動，紅綠紙條，分綶到兩對新人的身上來，彩色的碎紙片，在强烈的水銀燈下飛舞着，反映出絢麗燦爛的火花來，引導他們步向白首偕老永享　福的甬道上去。</p>

<h3>建「省」商兌</h3>
<p>（自第二）（版轉來）</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>建國大綢第十條規定：「在此時期中央輿省之權限採均　制度，凡事務有全國一致之性質者劃歸中央，有因地制宜之性質者劃歸地方，不偏於中央築權，或地方分權。』</p>
<p>「省被確認爲地方自治最高單位，有民　議會，有自治財職復應有自治事業，現行省政府組織法，最顯著缺點，並未標明省應做些什慶？僅僅說：「綜理全省政務」廣泛不着邊際。個人認為以後建國工作積極展開，省級事業，除全國一致性之事務，如國防軍事司法外交貨幣金融各項，應由中央統籌辦理外，其他應辦事務，應於組織法明文規定，列舉綢領，懸爲目標，俟省政當局，知所適從，將來省長競選，候選人亦得依據　領，於競選時，發表所擬採取之方法，以達到綱領所舉之目的，博取選民之同情，「省事業」之範疇，大體如左：</p>
<p>（一）全省戶口調查保甲整理之究成，（二）全省土地淸丈測量地籍整理之完成，（三）全省衛生網之完成，（四）全省敎育網之完成，（五）全省電話頗公路　航道網之完成，（六）全省荒地開懇，土壤改良，除災防害小型水利工程之完成，（七）全省合作事業，公營金業之推廣，（八）全省漁鹽　牧　桑，紡織以及一切農村副業之保護創導協助與改進，（九）全省養老育幼救卹事務之普遍興辦，（十）協助全省人民就業，務使耕者有地可耕，勞動者有工可做，企業者有發展機會，「省」有事業，則自治方不流於空泛，省級事業之進步與擴展，合其總和，亦即為整個國家之進步也。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>依規行省政府組織法，省政府主席，由國民政府就省政府委員中任命一人兼任，民財建敎各應處長之產生，則由行政院就省政府委員中提請國民政府任命，法律上如此規定，但實際上委員兼廳長，大多為省主席保鷹，省政府委員是政務官，但如委員而兼廳處長，就其任用順序看，則應視為政務官兼任事務官，將來省政府用省長制，不採委員制，省長仍爲政務官，由民選有一定任期，其以下之幕僚機構，不論民·財·建·敎·四廳長，以至秘書·保安·社會·地政·農林·糧食各處局長，均應一律規定為事務官，由中央主管部會遴選專門人員，提由行政院會議通過，轉請國府任命，不隨政務官共進退，如是地方自治各種事業，庶可繼續推進，不受政潮影響。縣級以下各局科長亦如此。</p>
<p>以上省縣各廳處局科長在執行職務上，仍分別受省縣長之監督，依照省縣政府一般處務規程辦事，但非依法受懲誠處分，或經省議會彈劾，不得免職，依上述規定，被免戰之人員，其繼任人選，仍由中央或省級主管機關，依法提請遴用。</p>
<p>歷代中國地方政府問題，「省」的一級，困難最多，幾千年來，從朱得到圓滿解決，原因是中央集權了，地方無事可做，地方分權了，便釀成割據狀態，國父首創均權學說，我認為均權解釋，應分兩方面：一方而，規定「事務有全國一致之性質者，劃歸中央，有田地制宜之性質者劃歸地方」另一方面，應為人治法治，保持均衡，治法治人，兼籌並顧，上述擬議「省」為自治最高單位，有財政，有事業，有職權，在法的方面，確定省的地位，人的方面，則省縣政務官，由民選議會監督，（當然現役軍人不得競選）省縣事務官由中央控制，眞正保持均衡狀態，使「省」於充分向治之中，仍能受中央有效控制與合理監督，避免再在歷史的循環圈上走。（完）</p>

<h3>配給不斷投機減少　金價日見穩定　港電羅比均有結款</h3>
<p>烚赤昨堅後轉疲，中行以一六〇萬之價，網續配給四八〇條，業中得此供給，銳氣被阻，銀根不若前數日之鬆濫，午後更難支持矣，晨初一六四萬，開後曾在一六五萬左右掙扎一時，入後稍受多方脫手而微降，中行配給時，在一六二萬光景，入後一六〇萬旣得配給，人心大定，遂退入一六〇大關，午刻在一五九萬左右徘徊，午後浮多續有殺出，見一五七萬後稍形穩定，結果較前收回跌四萬，銀樓飾金十七萬二，紋銀一千六，銀元八八〇元有賣，暗拆銀根初鬆後緊，息價自一角八分至二角二分不等，投機範日窄，短時期內難起風波。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔平靜，範圍狹小，過程呆滯，晨初在二〇五〇元光景掙扎，後以金市怯疲，遂稍降落，惟為數微細，直至午刻尚在二〇二〇元盤旋，午後形勢　散，交易更少，結果回挫三十五元，中行美匯仍掛二〇二〇元，港票老貨因紗花商結港電而帶好五元，新貨平後步穩，游資繼續搜納，三六年升至一二五元，三七年一二三元，而後稍形恍惚，結果好起十元，港電四五五元，羅比五五五元，均有結款。</p>
<h3>外滙開放以后　進出口漸活動</h3>
<p>自中央銀行公開申請外匯後，本市進出口商人連日向指定銀行申請購匯，極為擁擠，惟商人不明手續，因而往返數次者甚多，實則進口商屬於向由進口者，限制固少，如屬於許可進口者，則須先向「輸入品管理處」申請核發輸入許可設，然後方可申請外匯，至出口貨，必光將出口外匯結售於指定銀行，方可報運出口，現進口商向英美訂購之貨為汽車煤汕棉花棉布西藥烟草白紙及工業原料等，所購各貨成本加運費，仍較市價為廉，自下月起，可絡續到滬云。</p>
<p>本市出口貿易自太平洋戰爭發生後，停頓已久，刻因外匯正式開放，重趨活躍，茲悉歐美各國及南洋等地，現對我國土產及工藝品需要殷切，截至目前為止，已有英美比利時及南洋新加坡菲律賓馬尼刺等地，紛電本市市商會請求介紹貿易，其需要之我國土產品及工業品，計有瓷器陶器實石飾品電池草帽緶皮毛薄荷樟腦針織品猪　等廿餘種之多云。</p>
<h3>多頭獲利稅手后　華股漸漸回疲　游資又向外股進攻</h3>
<p>公債平和，無甚特殊變化，熱門丙種祗有一百元起仆，結果校前收微升二十元，甲乙則跌八十元，丁挫五十元，戊跌三十元，華股初穩後疲，盤旋之餘，各股均稍疲落，證券幫中獲利脫手，有以致之，外股述日未能與華股爭取上游，昨市忽有證券幫游資前來活動，結果怡紗怡啤紙業亞洲受華股獲利者靑睞，好起一成光景，其餘各股則稍不逮，上升有限，午後因逢週六，華股期交不多，僅永紗喊四千元光景，美亞三〇八〇元，景福二三八元，交易不多。</p>
<h3>兌付外幣公債</h3>
<p>規定新辦法</p>
<p>中央銀行國庫局駐滬辦事處接　總局通知，為劃一經付外幣公債手續，茲經規定持票人以金公債兌付本息，凡美金在十元以下，英金在兩鎊以下者，均應拆付國幣，美金在十元以上，英金在兩鎊以上者，如持有人願領原幣者，除仍塡公債還本付息申請書外，並須另塡由請匯票清單，一併送核，上項經付外幣公債手續，現已開始公吿實施，</p>

<h3>敎育特訊　國際文化合作之新事業（上）</h3>
<p>國立師範學院設立敎育資料室</p>
<p>敎育部為研究敎育學術，培養優良師資，曾於民國二十七年根據國防最高委員會之決議，恢復高級師範敎育制度，除將國立中央大學·浙江大學·西南聯大·西北聯大·及中山大學等五校之敎育院系，改組為師範學院外，並暫假湖南藍田創設全國性之獨立師院一所，定名為國立師範學院，以為全國之楷模。該院成立於茲七載，在廖院長世承領導之下，慘淡經營，成績卓著，最近該院與美國哥倫比亞大學約定，交換研究資料，實為戰時國際文化合作不可多得之新事業，該院特設敎育資料室主其事。敎育資料室成立，雖爲時未久，而工作已著成效。茲將該室近况探誌於後，以　讀者。</p>
<p>設立緣起</p>
<p>民國三十三年春，美國哥倫比亞大學，為溝通國際文化起見，經託請金陵女子文理學院院長吳貽芳博士介紹，與國立師範學院院長廖世承博士合作，約定交換研究資料辦法數項，其要點為：（一）交換代訂戰事發生以來，中美兩國出版敎育性質之定期刋物；（二）交換代購近年中美兩國出版之敎育新著；（三）編譯並交換戰事發生以來中美兩國敎育性質出版物目錄；（四）哥倫比亞大學師範學院圖書館所藏敎育性質之重要書籍，有複本者，每種贈送國立師範學院一册。該院為進行此項交換工作，以促進國際文化之合作；並為搜集國內外敎育資料，以便利敎育學術之研究起見，於民國三十四年春特設敎育資料室主其事。</p>
<p>現任職員　敎育資料室成立後，廖院長聘請前在哥倫比亞大學畢業之該院教授朱有光博士為主任。馮增祝氏爲幹事。</p>
<p>該室內部指導員，亦經院長聘定（以姓氏筆劃為序）王士略·朱有　·阮雁鳴·孟憲承·郭一岑·程宗潮·張文昌·及錢亞新諸氏担任。至於院外指導員及通訊員尙在選聘中。又為辦理各項事務起見，先後函請溆浦及藍田學生救濟委員會派來該院同學邱維城，劉鶚業·盧景秀·陳刃餘·何昌　五人分任繪圖，剪報，文書及管理書報等工作。</p>

<h3>隨馬帥視察散記（四）　叱咤風雲人物　將成為和平時代棟樑</h3>
<p>— 張劍梅寄</p>
<p>本報北平特派員</p>
<p>二日晚上的徐州會議，從飯後八點一直開到十二點鍾才散，會議中大家都吵得臉紅　子粗，馬帥也不禁發了脾氣。在這一帶新四軍的希望是：（一）共軍願退出隴海東段以交換運河以北國軍的駐地。（二）共軍進駐其所包圍的城市。（三）拆除交通綫上的障碍物。（四）政府軍退出中興煤礦，煤礦交商民管理。三方最後談商結果，決定：（四）交通綫上阻碍行車的障碍物一律拆除，其不妨碍行車的碉堡仍然保存。（二）中共與國軍都撤離中興煤礦，由政府，中共，商人三方共同管理，同時更輔以美籍工程師。據顧祝同主任說：這個礦上有三千政府軍被圍，三個礦井已被共軍奪去了兩個，剩下的一個礦井，因爲排水設備孤立了沒法利用，礦中積水日多，要不趕快解決，礦井就要浸壞了。</p>
<p>周恩來致詞　顯然門當戶對</p>
<p>三日午的新鄉會議，最初執行小組的中共代表曾以國軍撤離孟縣，爲冀南永年東明解圍的交換條件，馬帥指示：各問題應個別的合理解決，不可彼此牽扯，徒增糾紛，聰明的周恩來先生，接着起立發言，說明根據停戰協定和執行部的命令，各被圍城市裏的軍民，應該可以獲得糧食的接濟，同時交通應該趕快恢復，於是一塲糾纏多日的問題，因此大致解決，記者附帶應當報導的是：永年被圍數月，據說城內的樹皮已經吃光，最近已人相食，實在到了非解決不可的時候了。</p>
<p>當天晚上的太原會議，有過自徐州以後第二度的激辯，但是接濟被圍城市軍民以食糧，和交通迅述恢復的原則，都已確立了。</p>
<p>四日午的歸綏之行，近於訪問性質，綏包一帶，大致平安無事，最近的歸綏小組，也返平未歸。傳長官在歡宴席上致詞，在和平的前提下，有些小的衝突已不願提起，目前唯一的希望，是趕快恢復交通。周恩來的致詞，也是門當戶對的，他說他已命令中共軍隊不准再把一些小事件提起。</p>
<p>和平的檢討　臨于最后一天</p>
<p>當晚訪問延安，馬張周和毛澤東朱德曾廣泛的交換過國內外問題的意見，沒有討論任何具體的問題。</p>
<p>五日，這是和平的檢閱的最後一天了。馬張周在郊外幽靜綺麗的楊森花園裏接見漢口小組和政府中共軍事長官。豫鄂皖邊區雖然衝突停止平靜無事，但是共軍李先念部由於糧食缺乏，請求移轉皖北「五河」就食一事，却使軍事三人小組大感棘手。政府方面深恐數萬大軍移轉千里，影響民心和地方秩序，張治中部長當塲讓郭兼總司令懺，協助李先念師長解決糧食問題，遇必要時，政府還可以貸款給他們購買食糧。至於將來，李部是否移往皖北五河縣，留待到重慶後決定。這個問題並不是新問題，豫鄂皖邊大軍雲集，民間糧食搜羅一空。很早李先念部，就請求移往五河就食，漢口執行小紙把英文電報打到北平執行部，翻譯的人把「五河」譯成了「蕪湖」，政府委員鄭介民一看好不生氣，「怎麼？你們四萬大軍要開到蕪湖，是想奪取南京麼？」於是，問題就擱置下來了。　「最令人驚奇的，是在最短的期間內，造成了停戰的局面，這種奇蹟意味着諒解和好意，它是一個最重要的因素。」（馬歇爾。）</p>
<p>十八年來的中國歷史，像兩條綫合攏起來的一個大圓圈，最初一條向東，一條向西，它們一度成爲截然不同的南北極，但終於它們又在一個點上相遇，合攏了。</p>

<p>在這裏，讓我們檢閱一下，過去曾經叱咤風雲，而今後應該成爲和平的楝樑的人物吧！</p>
<p>到張家口去　初晤賀龍將</p>
<p>第一天到張家口，初次看到了賀龍，在激烈的綏包戰役裏，他竟沒有如傳說的陣亡。中等身材，看起來，不胖不瘦，挺結實的中年人。嘴裏老啣着一枝並不漂亮的粗糙烟斗，說起話來，那唇上一抹短短的鬍子，微微掀動，和他類乎四川話的湖南口音，處處都表現了他的崛强，豪爽和調皮。簽名也龍飛鳳舞，挺有英雄氣概。他對停戰命令的批評是：「好得很。」而且像一般四川人說話一樣，特別把那個「很」字拖長加重。對於整軍方案的實行，他不感覺什麼困難，說編餘的官兵可以回家種田，沒有田的，給他錢。他以諷刺的口吻，猛烈抨擊李守信的部隊。我們和他這一段談話不在張家口，而在集寗飛機塲上，「我們這飛機場上，也沒一間房子。」賀龍將軍慨嘆而又充滿希望的說：「開春了，我們打算，蓋他幾間房子啊」！和平與建設的慾望，朋顯的已在一個要揉碎現社會的將軍心裏，裊裊昇起了。在張家口，和第一次看見賀龍同時，我看見了中共冀熱遼軍區司令蕭克，和冀晋察軍區司令聶榮臻。蕭克是個細長條面孔瘦削，像一個剛從小縣城來，帶點土氣的年齡稍大的中學畢業生。聶榮臻是個白面書生，溫文爾雅，穿一身高貴的細呢軍服，聽說他曾留學法國，也是中共軍缺裏一名漂亮人物。</p>
<p>新四軍陳毅　說此后只吵架</p>
<p>湘西雪峯山一戰成名的王耀武將軍，現在濟南三四十里直徑的籠城裏，擔負着非常艱鉅的任務，可惜在濟時間倉促，沒有能够一聆他的談話，僅在飛機塲上，請他簽了個名字，字寫得滿大方，那個「武」字，差不多寫成「生」字，外加一點。中共新四軍長陳毅，身體魁梧，圓臉耳，滿面紅光，穿草綠粗布軍服。這位誇口「帶領卅萬大軍」的將軍，聽說還是留法學電機工程的。馬張周蒞濟的前一天，他和中共山東主席黎玉，一起從臨沂飛到濟南，王耀武和何思源親到機塲迎接。當晚王何大擺宴席，酒酣耳熱之後，「佐民兄」！（王耀武字）陳毅，喝得滿面通紅的說：「我們以後只准吵架，不准打架。」何思源補充一句說：「我們只在屋裏吵不嚷在外邊，」陳毅在對記者談話裏，不承認山東共軍包圍着國軍，一如果說是包闔，共軍的外邊不是還有國軍的大包圍嗎？」對於整軍，也不肯發表意見，認爲時間還早。</p>
<p>顧祝同主任　掀起無限回憶</p>
<p>在徐州，我們看到顧祝同主任，他恐怕是一位權力最大的綏靖主任，徐州綏署的轄區，不僅包括從黃河到長江的魯蘇兩個完整的省，而且旁及皖北浙東，辖區內有廿個軍，即將改爲廿個師，但是他不感覺一點的困難，說十六號起就要開始整編了。不久以前，剛害了一塲傷寒，現在面色還有點鐵靑，我們離開徐州的那天早晨，蒙顧主任接見，目前澎湃奔流的和平浪潮，重新掀起了他許多回憶。他說和周恩來，葉劍英，都是廿幾年的老朋友了。西安事變後，他主持西安行營，當時有兩個任務：一是負責整編張楊部隊，另一件便是和共產黨談判軍政問題，那時，他和周恩來曾有過一個禮拜的談判，談判的主題也是軍隊國家化，政治民主化的問題。可惜沒有談出結果，所有談判經過，都由他的夫人親筆紀錄，秘密珍藏，從來沒有對外發表。事隔十年，現在目睹停戰和政協約成功，衷心實感愉快。他判斷中共將會執行政協停戰整軍的協定，因爲每一個有遠見的共產黨員都會認識：不如此，共產黨是沒有前途的。</p>
<p>劉峙迎馬帥　熱誠趕到新鄉</p>
<p>劉峙主任從鄭州趕到新鄕歡迎馬歇爾，他依然面團團，一派紅光，保有「福將」風。在新鄉會議中他說：「我是個軍人，以服從爲天職，我服從執行部的一切命令」，頗予人以深刻印象。中共一二九師長兼晉冀魯豫軍區司令劉伯誠，雖然一隻眼睛最容易認了，但是我們好幾位同業都不曾把他找到。聽說有人問他對停戰命令有無誠意執行，他的回答是：「如果我沒有誠意，根本就不來了。」在新鄉馬，張，周，正開會的時間，我們偸閒去看了看剛剛被中共釋放的馬法五將軍，他曾經是協和醫科的學生，溫文爾雅，幾乎像個牧師。對於被俘經過，和在在共區的情形，他一點也不肯講，說他在那裏一直病着，到現在還不怎樣好，最後說了一大串他從軍和抗日的歷史。</p>
<p>到達太原之夜，我們疲倦得很，一早便上床睡了，夜半十二點以後，長官部交際處派人來敲門，說是閻長官接見我們，大家忙亂的揉開睡眼，穿衣乘車進城。那夜閻長官穿着一套特別爲歡迎馬歇爾而做的嶄新的黃呢軍服，足着明晃晃的帶刺馬靴三顆星的上將領章也閃閃發光，但是這位做了山西三十五年主人的將軍的確是老了，走起頭來顫巍巍的，對着我們幾位年輕人，他從大片眼鏡下射出期待而又寂寞的目光。翌晨，馬歇爾就要登車赴機塲前，閻長官像猛然想起遗忘了一件東西似的，又把我們四位記者找到會客室裏，吿訴我們他新發現的政治哲學：「要解除戰爭的威脅，必須先有一個正確的認識，即在立塲不同情形下，決無共同的利害，人格，和是非。向立塲不同的對方要求他守信義是妄想，不守信義正是他的人格，正是他的革命手段，我們應該原諒他。」在匆促之間，我們幾位也不曾把他這一段語重心畏的談話閙淸楚，究竟他是要大家提高警覺性呢？这是傳授着耶穌的敎條：「愛你的敵人」？在頭天晚上的談話中，記者問閻長官和劉伯誠談話沒有，「還沒有！」他說：「他是我的老部下，抗戰初期我指揮過他的，我們很熟。」</p>
<p>共軍官陳賡　與張治中重晤</p>
<p>三日晚上，在復興飯店的樓梯上，我還看見短小精悍穿一身灰軍服的陳賡〔晉南中共軍首長〕熱的打招呼。後來張部長吿訴記者，陳賡是黃埔一期的，十多年不曾見了，那天晚上，陳賡還特別到他房里談了很久，滿親熱的。這些年來，多少分道揚鑣的長官部屬，老師學生，今天都在和平的洪流中重新的握了手！</p>
<p>周恩來將軍　在歸綏受招待</p>
<p>到　綏，看到了傅作義將軍，他仍然和抗戰時期記者在陝壩所看見的一樣精神飽滿，穿着一身士兵制服。在歡迎三貴賓的茶會上，好多人的目光都在尋找周恩來將軍，傅氏就在這時候給大家介紹：「這就是周恩來將軍」。大家都笑了。周恩來的講話，永遠漂亮，他說：「我們對於傅長官抗戰的功績是永遠崇仰的，歷史的不幸使我們對立，使綏遠人民受了痛苦，我向綏遠民衆謹致同情的慰問。現在我們和平了，我們就永遠的和平下去，過去的讓它過去吧！」這動人的和平的一幕，在兩個月前血染綏包的時候，雙方當事人，怎能想到呢？　在延安，首次看到了朱德將軍，雖然是六十多歲的人了，仍然壯健得像一隻熊。一身佈滿灰　油漬的灰棉軍服，不但同士兵沒有分別，而且和伙伕也沒有兩樣。在延安的晚會上，他代表中共致詞：「我們中國共產黨是具有全部熱忱，願在　蔣主席領導下實現中國的和平，民主，統一，建設」。回想起來，去年日本剛投降後，朱德給蔣主席那通「你的政府」「你的軍隊」滿紙火星的電報，我們很容易的意識到，在過去半年毫無理由的烽火中，中國的歷史已經有了多麼大的進步！</p>
<p>漢口歡迎會　馬帥稱頌郭李</p>
<p>漢口的歡迎晚會上，郭兼總司令懺，和中共李先念師長的忠實執行停戰命令和誠懇的合作，都贏得馬帥的稱讚。郭懺將軍是漢口的老警備司令，個子不高，白淨子，滿堅實的。這次武漢行營程潛主任去重慶開會，他權代替了主人。李先念師長道是二次來漢口，停戰後，他把漢口已經跑得爛熟了。黃陂人，臉瘦削，很像營養不良，他的部隊的處境，正和陳毅在山東的情形成一個對比，他和執行小組處得很好；馬歇爾在宴席上，曾報吿：「我曾接到李將軍一封信，內容是對於福特上校離開光山小組表示惜別，同時，保證他將和繼任的古來福上校繼續密切合作，我認爲這是在悲觀的氣氛中的一線光明，那種特別的誠意，我表示謝謝。」（二月十三日）</p>

<h3>榮獲中國勛獎的美空軍人員</h3>
<p>我人當能憶及一九四三年七月，蔣夫人有美國之行。訪美後返回重慶時所乘飛機的機員，因爲對華服務有功，由我國政府授以「雲麾勛章。」圖示：華盛頓中國駐美大使館內舉行授勛時的悄形。（最左端）是中國空軍少將毛邦初，他正在向飛行工程師勃洛森握手道賀。蔣夫人座機上的機員，都是在美國陸軍空運司令部管轄下飛行服務的西綫航空台司等航空員。圖中後面排立着等待授勛的，便是他們這一羣。</p>
<h3>黃金白米在廣州</h3>
<p>— 特派員梁風</p>
<p>本報廣州航訊</p>
<p>勝利留給人們帶來美麗的憧憬，無窮的希望，彷彿勝利的來臨，生活的重担就可以放下，甚至可以重溫昔日安樂的舊夢，可是勝利已半年的今日，這重担非但沒有卸下，反而普遍地走着上坡路。</p>
<p>誠然，廣州自光復後，物價的高漲，日甚一日，尤以最近一旬間，黃金及米糧波動之大，實佔全國之冠，據記者調查所得，在二月中旬，黃金每兩之價格總徘徊在十三萬數千元至十四萬數千元間，白米（中等）每担之價格，也不過是由一萬八千元而漲至二萬另數百元而已。可是到了這一旬，其狂漲之程度，實使人警心動魄，黃金每兩最高已突破十九萬大關，而升至二十萬元，漲了百分之六十，白米呢？最高之價格已較中旬漲了百分之百，每百元僅得四兩，茲將二月下旬黃金及白米價格分列如下：</p>
<p>由此可知廣州目前的生活程度，但其飛漲的原因何在呢？是糧食關着恐慌嗎？抑或是奸商鑒於大批濟粵之米即將來到，而在未運到前來漁利一下嗎？是的；前者僅佔着絕少的成份，因本市存糧仍數二個月之用，而后者的操縱却是問題的　結。</p>
<p>投機家以東北局勢昆張，傳出種種使金價高漲的消息，而又大量購進黃金，造成金價飛騰直上；因爲金價的暴漲就刺激了物價，毅米亦隨之突飛猛進，步步高昇，一市高於一市，而市民見米價速漲，莫不　慌，紛紛購買以致一日內每担米竟漲數千元，恐怖的情緒漲滿整個五羊城。金價飛騰，刺激了糧食，糧食影響了民生，以致餓殍載道，路斃日達三十餘具，工人怠工等現象，這種現象隱藏着社會的危機。雖然，當局曾商定平抑糧價對策，查辦囤續居奇者，又嚴密管理糧商；又雖然濟粵之米麵有千萬担，可是說侵人有遠水救不了近火之感。而且解決人民生活是社會秩序的安定素，生活不能解決，社會就不會安寗，因此如何積極的平抑物值？怎樣有效的救濟失業的人？這是廣東當前的要題</p>
<h3>衡陽零陵災區　飢餓綫上來去</h3>
<p>— 秉凡寄</p>
<p>本報二日長沙訊</p>
<p>「請您殺我，破開肚來看看裏面有些什麽？」—一個搶犯對王縣長哭訴—</p>
<p>二月二十四日，記者參加湘省善救分署余署長赴衡永勘災的行列，三輛吉普車，由澐衡路穿過衡陽的北鄉，常天到衡陽。第二天過祁陽，參觀三個多鍾頭，當晚抵零陵。</p>
<p>杳無人跡　只碰到三條牛</p>
<p>這一路數百里長盡是災區，村莊沒有幾個人影，田園農苦都把屋頂揭去，僅留了幾段殘垣敗壁，農具也找不着甚麼出來，田裏聽說幾年沒有收割，遠遠看去草坡萬里，滿眼荒蕪，這一帶長途我們祇碰到三頭牛。老的小的人，從遠遠的田徑上寒慄戰抖的走過，他們叉起手，捧起飯碗，一個個望粥廠去，記者在衡陽第三粥廠問到一個小孩：</p>
<p>「你家裏做什麼？」</p>
<p>「作田，咳！」</p>
<p>「爹爹呢？」</p>
<p>「在屋裏要。」</p>
<p>「有飯吃嗎？」</p>
<p>小孩子掉掉頭，表示近來從沒有吃過飯。</p>
<p>消極的救濟本不是方法，余署長對「吃粥」是不大主張的，還是要治本，能做事的做事，不能做事的要回家去，送他回家，災民們都不要錢，都要工作。記者遇見一個湖北的難民，正望粥廠去，問他：「你爲什麼不回家呢？」</p>
<p>「回家了吃甚麼？穿甚麼？」是的，記者無法答復，四到家去，也待救濟，總要找事做才行</p>
<p>衣袴一套喪掉了兩條命</p>
<p>寇災已經過去，災痛留在老百姓的身上，疫災快要發生。現在正是旱災，田地都開了拆。衡陽光復以後，祇落過兩次雨，一次是古月十一月間，還有一次是記者到衡陽的前一晚，大雨傾盆，街上鄉下的平民跪在地上，當天道謝。他們互相敲鐵蓋，聲　器，感謝天老爺賜飯紛他們吃。</p>
<p>張達祥是幾年以前，衡陽西　裏一個大作家，現在小作都不可能了，家小十幾口，分途到各地去尋食，小孩子留在家裏哭泣，倒在祖母的懷裏，張遠祥把老婆的一條褲子，一件上身衣，偸到街上賣掉，買米兩斗回來，撫慰孩子，不要哭泣，今晚有飯吃。老婆回來，曉得這件事情，與他丈夫口角，小孩子抱住媽媽的腿子，哭破了嗓子。事後，張達祥回到房裏去，一個婆婆上了吊，是他的母親。他沒有哭，呆着眼睛衝出門去，跳在塘裏死了。</p>
<p>肩一斗米　也有被刧資格</p>
<p>衡陽的鄕裏，時常有搶刦殺人的事，有人費盡千辛萬苦，從遠方肩來一二斗米，走過偏僻的地方，隨時有被刦去的可能。縣政府捉到這些搶米的搶犯，已經有幾十名，有一個搶犯對王縣長說：「請你殺我，把我的肚子破開，看裏面有些什麼？」　我們道過祁陽，原來不想停留，直往零陵去，老百姓集在車站上，人山人海，幾萬人頭，他們要救濟，余署長下車，發麥粉六噸，參觀粥廠。東江橋到粥廠有里多路，排山倒海的難民，蜂擁載道，扶老携幼，傴僂而行。據說粥廠開辦那天，祗幾百人。第二天幾千人，第三天萬多人，現在三萬多了，他們有的像骷髏，有的疥瘡爛得像苦瓜，臭氣撲鼻，美國小姐康樂利摸摸一個難童的上身衣，對余署長掉起頭來。</p>
<p>郵陽黃運鄕鄕民，呈文到縣政府來。要求發「逃荒證」或者「棺材」他們祗能求生，或者求死</p>
<p>在報紙上，我們發現一段啓事。是這樣寫的：</p>
<p>李　妹啓事　啓者：氏原配夫　榮瑛，因客歲不幸被日寇拉伕槍斃，膝下所生二子，係屬黃口，並祖母年邁無食，有阿翁譚伯樂，雇其幼子，繼室於祖，及氏兒等，毫無給養，際此大旱年節，氏女流難担數口生活，飢迫不已，祗得脫譚妙關係，嫁與本鄕陳全芝爲妾，而活子女，幷得本身洋一萬五千元付祖母，現燃眉給養，除央請族戚申明外，特此升吿。</p>
<p>蕨根充飢　樹皮草根不留</p>
<p>到零陵，我們往共信鄕看災，共信鄕有二萬四千人。據說有兩萬人沒有飯吃，鄕民從瓦礫塲中跑過來，紛紛跪在路邊央求我們，「天老爺！你老教救我們！」眼淚一顆顆，沿着眼眶滾下來。余署長欲哭無淚，同情撫慰一番，翟綺文小姐似乎很難堪。伸出手去，表示扶他們起來，他們在火燒坪搭茅棚居住，吃樹皮草根，——地草花，噶根，欖樹皮，穿心草，鵝芽草，蕨根，還有糠和麥壳，蕨根長一二尺，直徑圓形三四分，黑色，從山地掘來。余署長問他們吃甚麼？老婆婆指着她手上一籃蕨根說：『吃這個』！</p>
<p>三歲小兒　只値一萬塊錢</p>
<p>零陵的街上，一大淸早晨，有件奇怪的買賣，篾籃子擺在街兩邊，籃子里坐着包着的是小孩子，二歲多的，也有三四歲或五六歲的，身上插一個篾圈，孩子半知半不知的玩着篾圈兒，大人們站在旁邊，苦着臉色望着來來往往的過客，買主都是外地來的，（如桂林一帶客人）看見孩子長得縹緻，不妨帶一個回去，有的賣了幾天，賣不脫身，也有不要錢送人的。</p>
<p>有一個名呌張信善的本地人，有三個兒子，暗地裏把一個三歲的孩子賣了，得一萬塊錢，這是好生意，回家以后，妻子跳水死了。兩個孩子問他要媽媽，以後就不曉得音信怎樣。</p>
<p>待字深閨　十八歲當妓女</p>
<p>還有一樁悲慘的新聞：李二妹是一個十八歲少女，待字閨中，寄食在姑媽家裏，姑媽家要吃草根，把她賣掉當妓女，賣身剛三天，記者曾會晤過一次，跟他談話，她總是把頭低下來。燈影隋淡，頭髪披在李二妹的胸前。</p>
<p>這裏沒有結尾，衡零道上的人民，是這樣繼續的痛苦，死去。記者僅能以同情的心緒，寫出這篇文字，願各界伸出援救的手來，給這篇通訊下個實際結論。美國陸軍醫務團羅立茂中校協力完成一種新式愛克</p>

<h3>上海需要「兒童劇塲」</h3>
<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>戲劇並不只是一種單純的娛樂，它實在含有深刻的敎育意義，因爲戲劇是通過了藝術的敎育，直接能够影響觀衆，這些理論以前提過的人是很多的了。</p>
<p>現在我們所提起的，乃是戲劇對于兒童敎育的關係，戲劇不僅能敎育成年人，對于兒童所發生的影響恐怕還要更其深刻。</p>
<p>我國過去有個孟母三遷的有名故事，隣居的一舉一動在無形中還可以影響賢者孟子，透過藝術形式的戲劇表演，能够導誘一般平凡的兒童，似乎無庸加以疑問的了。兒童們是最愛學習和模倣的，面且在幼年時所受到的敎育對他一生前途的影響也很有關係，所以如能利用戲劇藝術來做敎育兒童的工具，其效果一定是很大的。</p>
<p>談到利用戲劇宣傳敎育兒童，首先要研討的自然是兒童戲劇的提倡問題，更實際的便是需要有「兒童劇塲」。有了兒童劇塲，兒童才有受敎育的塲所，那麼所需要的兒童戲劇才會應運而產生創造出來，</p>
<p>〔兒童劇塲〕據說是始創于一九一八年蘇聯十月革命的第一週年，因爲蘇聯是最注重宣傳的，他們曾宣稱：利用「兒童劇塲是敎育兒童成爲未來戰士最有效用的工具。兒童劇塲在美國也很普遍，香港也曾有人一度發起過這種運動，成績還很不錯。現在說到我們號稱國際大都會的上海，供給成人享受的劇塲雖然不少，但「兒童劇塲」似乎尙無人提及過，所以筆者想借此作一建議，希望對于社會敎育和戲劇運動有成就的高明人士，共同來發起這一個提倡「兒童劇塲」運動，我們相信這不僅是上海兒童的幸事，對于整個國家社會也很有裨益的罷。</p>
<p>劇評</p>
<h3>戲劇春秋（光華演）</h3>
<p>— 邵子傑</p>
<p>該感謝戲劇工作者爲劇運拓了荒，播了種，劇運底路是曲折的，艱難的，然而年靑的工作者却任勞任怨地，前仆後繼地，熱情地，傻勁地爲戲劇工作着，孕育着悽絕哀傷。展現在「戲劇春秋」中的：有劇運工作者的成功，也有着劇運工作者的失敗，有劇運工作者的光榮，也有着劇運工作者的恥辱，有……這不僅是戲劇界底里程碑。呈現在全劇底也該是劇運工作者的滄桑史，雲　底死亡，若燕的墮落，陸憲揆爲劇團的經濟慌鬧着苦悶，唐倩倩的被腐化，以及孟輝江涵等爲戲劇沉着地工作，是劇運的工作者照亮了戲劇底路，他們的屍骸奠下了成功的基石，不踏過這些人的屍骸，中國新劇述動是不會達到他的目的地的。</p>
<p>劇作者不僅刻劃了劇運工作者的血淚，同樣地更照見了時代的陳朽；馮志先生的阻止女兒演戲，警察局的對男女合演戲剧的禁演，以及演劇者爲喊了「東北是我們的」的話而遭受了憲警的阻止，沒有了戲劇，時代的蛻新決不會這樣快的，從這更可明證着劇遝工作者底血汗並沒有白流。</p>
<p>全劇的人物是够多的，然而劇作者却把這些處理得那末地和諧，有條，統一，在集體的創作中却又沒有留露了傳統的破綻。導演把全劇排演得很好，丁聰的裝置，沈剡的燈光，更使舞台設計得那麼地柔和可愛。就演呂論大體上均能配合得適當，藍馬的陸憲揆確有着超特的成功，翟宇的　輝，以及戴耘的任覺羣都演得很好，宛蘇的雲霓在前半劇飾女學生時演得確够微妙，在後半劇中範電影明星時却有些不够。</p>
<h3>譚目前的話劇</h3>
<p>— 路萍</p>
<p>我所以喜歡「話劇」並不是人言亦言，它新奇，它比「京劇」「的　戲」進步，我是覺得前者有血有肉，能够反映現實議惡，黨情緊凑，具體，不像京劇那樣抽象，不似「的篤戲」那棵的千篇一律的緣故。雖然現階段的「話劇」也有許多不如人意的地方，但這些都不足以阻碍它底進步，它底成長與發展。筆者爲了希望話劇在中國有更好的前途，原對現在話劇界的不良風氣，在這裏幾句想要說的話。</p>
<p>話劇在目前似有這樣的現象：一。祗要能寳座就以爲這劇本很不錯。二·祗要有演出，就以爲自已了不得，就以爲達到了話劇的任務與使命。粗看起來，這理由似乎很對，能賣座，有演出，自然是發展演劇的主要條件，</p>
<p>過値得我們注意與驚惕的，能賣座的戲，往往是迎合低級趣味者的心理，所以不一定是好戲；有演出的劇團，往往不計較劇本的好壞與現實的需要，所以也不定是好劇團。問題的關鍵，報在於劇本底內容是否進步，劇團的演出是否忠實。換句話說，如果忘記新演劇運動的崇高目標——反帝與反封建，促進民主化與科學化——不論這劇本如何能賣座，這劇團如何繼續不斷地爲新演劇運動耕種辛勞，這樣的劇本與這樣的劇團依然不是今後中國所需劇的。</p>
<p>健全批評，接受批評，對新演劇運動亦十分重要。因爲戲要批評一方面能使讀者及觀衆，一步理解作品的主題與特質，怎樣去接受劇作者所寄托的思想，一方面使劇作者都能把握現階段戲劇寫作的最高準則，使演員，導演以及負責燈光，効果……的人，對今後工作有所注意。可惜這原則，各地今天還很少做到，近幾年來，後方爲這個問題，而且發生好多次不幸的悲劇，有還社因刊載戲劇批評的文字被打得落花流水的，有寫戲劇批評的作者被打得皮開血流的。這樣一來，會寫的不敢寫，不會寫的，却起來瞎吹瞎寫，若千地方有些劇團盡是自吹自寫，這種現象，希望在今後演劇界能够不再存在。</p>

<h3>沈浮</h3>
<p>— 魯子</p>
<p>如果不是健忘的觀衆，一定會記得曾經轟動一時的兩部電影—「自由大地」（陳燕燕，歐陽紅櫻主演。）「天作之合」（白璐韓蘭根生演。）由於這兩部影片也就會聯想到大個子導演沈浮，沈胖子不但是戰前聯華影業公司的紅導演，這幾年在後方極端堅苦的工作環境下還完成了三部巨作—「小人物在想曲」，「金玉滿堂」，「重慶二十四小時」，這三個劇本在後方各地都曾演出，賣座成績可謂打破紀錄，而內外行均一致贊爲佳作，三劇中以重慶二十四小時更爲精彩，內容係描寫重慶二十四小時內各階層人的塑像，在成都曾二次公演。</p>
<p>沈浮在抗戰開始時便與白楊等組影人劇團入川，排演了不少的話劇，如雷雨日出原野等等，在「日出」中沈氏還以演員姿態演出潘經理。以後溫松康與秦威在西安重新復興西北電影製片廠，不遠千里派員聘請沈浮與賀孟斧參加合作，孟斧則就地攝製其新作「風雪太行山」（歐陽紅櫻謝添主演。）沈浮則遠道西北攝製其自編自導之「老百姓萬歲」但因交通與物質大成問題，（値太平洋大戰爆發膠片來源已絕。）只好中途擱淺，這部戲費他了很多的心血，他自已說「不能完成實在是我終生遺憾」在「西電」劇團他也排演了很多話劇。</p>
<p>三年前，中央電影攝影場特聘他任編導之職，他的三部傑作也就是在進中電後完成的在重慶是第一流紅導演，沈浮能有今日之地位，次不是偶然的機遇，第一他修養好，待人誠懇，凡跟他合作的朋友，沒有一個不尊敬他的，劇團中鬧人事，只要沈浮出來調停便一點問題也沒有了，他現在已經四十歲，太太是蘇州人，美麗，賢淑，溫柔，可惜身體不大好，時常要閙小病，但想不到沈大塊頭粗中有細，很能體貼她，最近沈浮趕排完了，謝添的「上海灘夜潮」後，接着又是楊翰笙的「草莽英雄」，大概在下月中飛北平，攝其新作電影劇本「英雄母親」及「峨嵋春曉」，關別了的平滬觀衆，請靜候佳片吧！</p>

<h3>漫談「萬世師表」</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>話劇運動，幾年來以戰時首都的重慶和敵後的上海爲根據，頗表現出一番蓬勃的光景。兩者環境雖截然不同，但劇作家們為殘酷的現實所陶冶，競向接近眞理這一點上竭盡努力却是一致的，而這種傾向，表現後方的劇作家中尤爲明顯。他們不但懂得憎，更懂得愛；不但鞭打與控訴，更轉而有激觔與歌頌。這種向上的陽性的劇作，我們竹經看過苦幹演出曹禺先生的「蛻變」，現在我們又讀到了袁俊先生的「萬世師表」。</p>
<p>苦戰八年，生靈塗炭，在干戈遍地中，我們却看見了許多可歌可泣的率與人；若干敎育家艱苦卓絕的精神，凜然冰雪的節操，就是其中的一例。袁俊先生排開抗戰中種種值得非議和鄙薄的現象，用藝術家敏銳的觀察，溫厚的同情，替我們完成了一個聖潔的塑像。袁先生筆于底的大學敎授林桐，有光，有熱，同時却是出入風塵，有血有肉的人物。在這）點上，他比「蛻變」中的丁火夫和梁專員，和我們更爲熟識而可親。</p>
<p>在林桐教授的周圍，袁俊先生也寫了若干時代的渣滓，那些忍不住貧窮與勢利，改學爲商的敎授。而這不祗是爲了陪襯，也爲了掘發眞實。「萬世師表」是寫實的，然而飽孕着高遠的理想。作者用飽酣淋濟的筆觸打動我們，同時用恣肆奔放的熱情鼓動我們，使我們的精神昇華，向上。</p>
<p>現在「萬世師表」已經由中常劇團在蘭心上演了。它在重慶我相信「萬世師表」將更爲上海的人士所激賞吧。</p>

<h3>杏花春雨江南　（于伶）</h3>
<p>— 紫傑</p>
<p>「我全國軍民於此更要痛切認識我們淪陷區同胞的痛苦是到了怎樣的境界，……我全國同胞替這些求死不得，報國無路的同胞想一想便知道他們急待我們救援是如何的迫切了……」—錄自蔣委員長抗戰七週年耙念日昭告軍民書—</p>
<p>六年前我流着淚讀完了于伶先生的「夜上海」，今天我又慶幸地拜讀了于伶先生的近作「杏花春雨江南」，這二部該是有着關聯的劇本，展現在後者的人物也就是前者底主角，如說「夜上海」所描擬的是抗戰初期的苦難，那末後者所刻劃的當是半淪陷區的慘狀。我確曾愛過「夜上海」中的實况，然而如今我得說我已更愛了「杏花春雨江南」的情事，姑不論「夜上海」所指示我們的是甚麼，然而「杏花春雨江南」總該是個針對現實的好戲。</p>
<p>故事的展現是在江南的半淪陷的桐林地帶，敵人爲實行其統制桐果的目的，於是不惜地利用了路通梅玗二奸逆設法想收買梅家的桐園，然而梅嶺春這桐園的主人，一個剛從上海逃難回鄕的忠貞的鄉紳却堅決地拒絕了這秋天，桐果收獲的晚上，桐園突在敵人的火熖下粉焚了，然而遊擊隊却早在前一日把桐果全搶救了下來。梅嶺春望着再度被刧的家園，憤恨地終於讓女兒夢輝正式地加入了政工隊，在桐果給遊擊隊滿載在船上預備載回大後方的那天，又鼓勵着自已的兒子梅珠去加入了大後方的空軍，抗戰的勝利，梅嶺春的功勞決不能被抹殺的，而全劇所顯示的也以光朋面的多，誠這樣「杏花春雨江南」所昭吿我們的也以振奮的部份居多，在抗建的宣揚上「杏花春雨江南」的效果該是挺大的。</p>
<p>從熟悉的影子中細味着劇中的情事，古老的記憶中重又　上了悲痛的血痕，該感謝子伶先生已把這些寫成了劇本，從這，我相信着人們對淪陷區的苦况可又多得一重的了解，誠如劇本中說：「淪陷的同胞是這樣的在熬，這樣的在守，這樣的期待反攻，急待救援，要大後方一切爲了反攻，搶救淪陷區的人民，收復淪陷了的土地，記着……要記着我的話，別忘了一切爲了反攻，搶救淪陷區……」這該是瀕死的號呼，而于伶先生却替淪陷區的人民喊出了口，幸運地抗戰已勝利，如今橫在我們面前的問題是建國，不當再歧視的我想，眞正的人原都有着愛國的人心。</p>
<h3>淞韻曲集记</h3>
<p>— 莊一拂</p>
<p>晚近研崇劇學者，好尙殊端，獨於崑曲，習者實尠。况當河山未整之時，不免有禾黍離離之感。余歸里三年，醉臥江鄕，乃不復彈此調，病後益拋置不顧。自勝利光臨，氈腥蕩滌，奉命戌滬，重來海上，下榻於淞韻別墅。主人伉儷，對崑曲固深所嗜焉。居恒登白雪之高樓，邀靑溪之旧侶，集必叙曲，月必兩三。今春（二十四日）復舉盛會，而新大後方來滬諸曲友，莫不欣然　蒞。數年闊契，重叙一堂；曲中笛弄，風花四飛。窮日夕之興，竟得劇目二十有四，主人可謂好客如孔北海，嗜曲如魏良輔矣。</p>
<p>是日開鑼，依次淸歌遊園。酒樓。思凡。蔗林。茶叙。琴挑，而以七三老人嚴工上之陳妙常，自饒嫵媚。淸音旣發，精微圓妥。嚴近担任上海市立實騐戲劇學校課程，殊屬難得。次爲痴夢·拾畫·收留·佳期，張賡麟之崔氏，高亢處頗非易事；王巽之之柳夢梅，亦淸逸有致。再則聞鈴·寄予·望鄕、卸封，朱錫華之唐明皇，唱白俱見蕭疏，更以最後武陵花，亮而不亢，超然人勝；朱錫貞與共令尊之寄子，由許伯猷猷笛，頓成激昂之音，如哀泉赴壑，聽者屛息，至於對白穩練，猶其餘緒。盛成之飾望鄕之蘇武，以巾幗而發蒼昔，並極現塞外孤臣，望闕心殷，亦屬難能，而座上客如姚季琅·陳乃文·汪淑光·蔡漱六·李希同諸女史莫不聚精會神。至此華炬已張，趙景深預定之盤夫，因其未到，一再移後。於是公次以壓軕之內廷本奇雙會提前。朱堯文之禁子，甚流利。余唱李奇，實非本行，尤以水金傳芷雙笛齊赴，殊感乏力。寫狀由沈　逸演趙冲，主人翁孔太太演桂枝。沈爲有數之巾冠生，而孔太太更以閨　靡曼之音，使聽者屏息。曲終人靜，幾令闌畹不香，玉臺失色。三拉加入趙景深之保僮，味永无盡也。筵後盤夫小宴，重開塲面，極饜曲興。而以夏煥新之彈詞爲殿。時近午夜方散。酒闌歌倦，聊寫數語，歸諸主人，藉誌鴻爪焉。</p>

<h3>The Plenary Session Passes Presidium Proposal: Abolish the Supreme National Defense Council, Restore the Central Political Council as the Party's Guiding Organ for Politics, and Entrust the Chairman to Nominate and Appoint Government Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Second Plenary Session held its 18th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 16th. 311 members were in attendance, with President Chiang chairing. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the 17th meeting, the Chairman presented a report on the Political Consultative Conference, examining Report No. 1, namely the draft resolution on the PCC report, and submitted it for discussion. Gu Zhenggang, convener of the original review committee, reported on the review process. Jiang Dingwen, Li Wenzhai, Xiao Zheng, and others successively put forward amendment suggestions, which were discussed and passed with amendments. Subsequently, the Chairman presented Review Report No. 2, namely the draft resolution on issues such as the National Assembly and the Constitution Draft, and submitted it for discussion. Convener Lin Bin explained in detail, and Sun Ke then reported to the Assembly on the principles for revising the Constitution Draft, the latest consultation situation, and the three agreements reached on the 15th evening, namely (1) The National Assembly is a tangible organization that exercises four powers, (2) The abolition of item 6 of Article 2 of the PCC's "Principles for Revising the Constitution Draft," and (3) The abolition of provincial constitutions in favor of provinces drafting autonomous regulations. As for the Legislative Yuan's power of consent to the President's appointment of the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan's power of consent to the President's appointment of political officials, no agreement has yet been reached. Wu Jingheng then put forward opinions: (1) The power and responsibility to enact the Constitution belongs to the National Assembly, and no one can restrict the statutory powers of the National Assembly representatives, (2) The agreements of the "Five-Five Constitution Draft" consultation meeting, the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, and the opinions put forward by various parties and factions should all be sent to the National Assembly for reference, (3) After the Constitution is enacted, legal procedures must be followed to avoid ridicule from China and abroad. After the speech, President Chiang made a speech, elaborating on the Premier's legacy, the Three Principles of the People, and the Five-Power Constitution, stating that the National Assembly should be tangible and should exercise four powers, and the five Yuans should be separate and not mutually restrained, so that they can each be independent and exercise their five powers. The Chairman then announced the vote, which unanimously passed, and handed the case over to the Central Standing Committee for responsible handling. After a break, the draft resolution on the review report on the Northeast issue was discussed. After the Chairman explained, the vote was announced and passed. The case was handed over to the Central Standing Committee for responsible handling. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>The President Attends the National Assembly with Dual Capacity</p>
<p>At 3:45 PM, the 18th meeting continued, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. First, the Presidium presented a report stating that regarding the qualification of the Party President to attend the National Assembly in the future, after the Presidium's deliberation, in addition to naturally attending and guiding the Assembly in the capacity of the Head of State, he should also be one of the Party's representatives to the National Assembly. Therefore, the President's attendance at the National Assembly should be in a dual capacity. The Chairman submitted this case for discussion, and after Wang Zhengting, Sun Ke, and others spoke and discussed it, the Assembly unanimously stood up and passed the Presidium's deliberation. The Presidium's three proposals were then passed: (1) The procedures for generating government members are as follows: Government members are nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and appointed by the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee. If the candidates from various parties cannot submit their lists before the closing of the Second Plenary Session, then they will be nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and appointed by the Standing Committee. (2) Since the war has ended, the Supreme National Defense Council should be abolished immediately, and the Central Political Council should be restored to serve as the Party's highest guiding organ for politics. Its organization and candidates will be nominated by the President and decided by the Standing Committee. (3) The procedures for generating the Party's representatives to the National Assembly are as follows: A. The Party should have 220 representatives. 150 of these are allocated to the Central Committee. The Central Executive Committee members, alternate Executive Committee members, Central Supervisory Committee members, and alternate Supervisory Committee members present at the meeting will use the anonymous limited consecutive voting method to select two-thirds of the names from the list of all members of the Sixth Central Committee (i.e., each person selects 100 names), and those with more votes will be elected. B. 70 names are allocated to party members and Youth League members who are not members of the Central Committee, but who hold important responsibilities in the Central or local governments and have struggled for the Party and achieved remarkable results (including members of the Legislative Yuan's Constitution Drafting Committee), who will be selected by the Standing Committee. Zhang Daofan, on behalf of the Presidium, explained the selection methods for Standing Committee members and Central Committee members of the Party in the National Assembly, and the election began immediately. The Presidium appointed the following members of the National Assembly Election Supervisory Committee: Huang Shaoqi, Li Qian, Huang Shao Gu, Hu Shuhua, Liu Hengjing, Li Yongxin, Li Ciwen, Wang Junying, Deng Qingyang, Dr. Yao Yue, Tang Shizun, Lin Bin, Xiong Bin, Qian Yonghe, Gesang Zeren, Ma Hongbin, Ding Delong, Li Yannian, Zhang Yi, Zhao Lanping, etc. The members of the Standing Committee Election Supervisory Committee were: Liu Wendao, Li Mingyang, Zhang Weizhen, Li Jingzhai, Cui Zhenhua, Wang Zizhuang, Zhang Zhen, Zhu Xiuxia, Liu Keshu, and Dang Zhen. After the election, the Chairman announced that many important proposals had not been fully discussed and that the closing date of the plenary session would be extended by one day. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Government Reorganization Scheduled for Implementation Next Week</h3>
<p>Chen Lifu to Head the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] According to today's "World Daily News": The reorganization of the Chinese government is expected to be implemented next week, after which Chairman Chiang plans to visit the United States.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to local newspapers: Chen Lifu is rumored to be appointed as Minister of Interior. The Minister of Interior will be a powerful position in the reorganized government, as he will act as the Premier when the Premier is absent.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Today's newspapers report that the government will establish a Women's Department. It is also stated that the People's Freedom Protection Law has been implemented on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Air Force Personnel Returning Home from the United States via Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch] The American ship "Robin Hood" arrived in Yokohama yesterday, carrying approximately 200 Chinese Air Force officers and students who had been studying in the United States, 8 Chinese officials, and 3 American engineers. Some of the officers had fought against the enemy in the skies of their motherland before going to the United States. The three American engineers arrived here en route to China to assist the Resource Commission's design work.</p>
<h3>Following the Direction of Democratic Politics and Establishing the Norms of a Modern Nation: The Plenary Session Passes a Resolution on the Political Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Second Plenary Session passed a resolution on the political report at its 17th meeting. The full text is as follows: Since the First Plenary Session, Japan has unconditionally surrendered, and major changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation. The government, in order to achieve victory and peace, signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Furthermore, recognizing the need for peaceful nation-building, it convened the Political Consultative Conference. This is indeed a major period in the history of our Party. After reviewing the Executive Yuan's complete work report and the achievements in governance since the First Plenary Session, this Assembly believes that the Executive Yuan's work has failed to meet the requirements of this major period. The reasons for this are not one-sided. The government's ineffective implementation of the policies set by the Sixth National Congress, especially the many errors in financial and economic matters, are undeniable. In addition to resolutions on foreign affairs, political consultation, finance, and economy, the following are the main points of review and reform proposed for general administrative work, combining the Assembly's review proposals and discussions:</p>
<p>"Review Section"</p>
<p>(1) For many years, bureaucratic capitalism has long constituted the greatest political malpractice, especially with perfunctory behavior and abuse of power for personal gain being prevalent. As a result, officials do not know what their responsibilities are, and they do not respect principles and policies. This malpractice has become completely exposed since the victory. Various tasks during the recovery period were mostly unprepared. Some of the receiving personnel violated laws and disciplines and lost popular support, all as a result of habitually disregarding principles and not respecting the national system. This Assembly expresses deep sorrow and desires the government to strive for correction. The unreasonable treatment of public education personnel and military police is a major reason for low efficiency and lax discipline in recent years. The Sixth National Congress has already made a solemn decision on this, but the government has paid little attention. This must be effectively resolved in the future.</p>
<p>(2) The excessive size and complexity of institutions and the discrepancies in laws and regulations have resulted in unclear authority and responsibility, reducing effectiveness. Adjustment should be made promptly, distinguishing between retention and abolition.</p>
<p>(3) The mismatch between personnel and policies is an abnormal phenomenon in politics. The lack of distinction between political officials and administrative officials, political officials not knowing the policies they should implement, and the advancement and retreat of administrative officials not being fully in accordance with regulations have led to a weak sense of responsibility and rendered the government incompetent.</p>
<p>(4) Local self-government is the central task of the tutelage period, and successive Congresses have solemnly resolved this, but for several years the government has failed to effectively implement it, so that local self-government still has no foundation when constitutional government is about to be implemented today.</p>
<p>"Improvement Measures"</p>
<p>Regarding Reform of the Political System</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the reform of the political system, in order to seek progress in politics, reforms must be urgently sought in the political system, policies, and personnel, following the direction of democratic politics and establishing the norms of a modern nation. In terms of the system, institutions must be simplified, authority and responsibility must be clarified, the spirit of hierarchical responsibility must be implemented, and a sound civil service system must be established. The participation of non-Party members in government organizations should not be based on the Party's reasonable and effective reform of the national administrative structure, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Government is the highest organ for deciding state affairs. All design bureaus, review committees, and specialized committees of the former Supreme National Defense Council should be abolished and merged.</p>
<p>(2) The various ministries, commissions, and administrations of the Executive Yuan should be rationally adjusted and divided according to their duties, so that name and reality match, authority and responsibility are clear, redundant branches are eliminated, and superfluous personnel are eliminated. After the return to the capital, the number of central personnel should be reduced in stages to replenish local manpower. However, alternative employment and career changes must be found for the laid-off personnel.</p>
<p>(3) The separation of military and civilian affairs is the norm of modern nations. Active military personnel should not concurrently hold civil administration positions. All matters involving military supplies should be handled by military agencies through civil administration agencies.</p>
<p>(4) The police are tools of the rule of law. In the future, the quality and treatment of the police must be improved to establish a sound police system.</p>
<p>(5) To clarify politics, a sound talent system must be established: 1. Political officials must be responsible for their policies. If policies fail or are poorly implemented, they must be held accountable. 2. Administrative officials must be long-term in their positions. The government must promote talent, eradicate the evil habit of appointing personal favorites, and should implement periodic transfers to gain experience. As for the improvement of treatment, all false systems, annuity systems, and pension systems must be clearly stipulated. In order to implement a sound talent system, in addition to the national budget, the authority and responsibilities of the Examination Yuan and the personnel departments of various agencies must also be systematically adjusted.</p>
<p>Regarding vigorous implementation of policies</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the vigorous implementation of policies, the policies of our Party's past Congresses have all been correct. The poor performance of governance is not due to errors in policy, but to ineffective implementation or distortion during implementation. The political program decided by the Sixth National Congress is still the guideline for future governance. The Peace and Nation-Building Program decided by the Political Consultative Conference is generally in line with our Party's policies, and we should lead all parties and factions to promote its implementation. However, in view of the current internal and external situation, this Assembly believes that protecting national sovereignty externally, clarifying officialdom internally, and stabilizing people's livelihoods are the foundations of current governance. Ensuring national unity and solidarity, protecting people's rights, and eradicating bureaucraticism and bureaucratic capital are prerequisites for clarifying officialdom. Actively restoring transportation and order to restore production and replenish supplies are prerequisites for stabilizing people's livelihoods. Therefore, the following matters that should be implemented immediately are solemnly proposed:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the principle of maintaining the integrity of territorial sovereignty and the determination to uphold international peace treaties, espionage on the true friendship between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(2) Adjust the border governments and make as much use as possible of border compatriots to participate in central and local administration in order to implement our Party's border policy.</p>
<p>(3) Effectively implement the military restructuring plan and urge the Communist Party to fulfill its agreements in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army.</p>
<p>(4) Governments at all levels must not arbitrarily establish orders without the consent of people's representative bodies at all levels and the approval of higher-level governments.</p>
<p>(6) The government should promptly investigate the damages suffered by the people due to the war and formulate compensation methods.</p>
<p>(7) All factories and mines recovered in the recovery area should resume production within a specified period. At the same time, new industries should be actively developed, first to settle demobilized officers and soldiers and public education personnel who have contributed to the war of resistance, and to mobilize national manpower to engage in local production projects and the construction of various public works.</p>
<p>(8) Immediately stipulate the implementation steps and methods for "land to the tiller." The government will issue land bonds, purchase land from large landlords, and distribute it to demobilized soldiers and poor farmers. It will also effectively support owner-farmers, protect tenant farmers, and rapidly implement effective agricultural loans based on methods such as taxing urban land according to assessed value, returning price increases to the public, and purchasing land at assessed value to stabilize rural areas.</p>
<p>(9) Investigate the wealth of those who profited from the war, impose heavy taxes on them, investigate the stolen property of illegal receiving personnel, and carry out the requisition of wealth and foreign exchange from the super-rich, especially strictly implement a moderate and reasonable progressive income tax system.</p>
<p>(10) Protect the property of overseas Chinese in diplomacy and support the businesses of overseas Chinese in the economy.</p>
<p>(11) Effectively improve the treatment of public education personnel and military police.</p>
<p>(12) The Water Conservancy Commission should effectively formulate plans and actively carry out river and river management to prevent possible floods.</p>
<p>(13) Conduct a national household registration and property census.</p>
<p>Regarding personnel innovation</p>
<p>(C) Regarding personnel innovation, with a system and policies, political innovation is still empty talk without sound personnel. Today's political malpractices are half in the system and half in personnel. The following are the main points of personnel innovation:</p>
<p>(1) Those who have been sanctioned or escaped the law due to attachment to rebellion and corruption shall never be employed.</p>
<p>(2) Those who have no achievements in their positions should be replaced.</p>
<p>(3) Statistics on corruption cases of receiving personnel. The relevant supervisors in charge should be dismissed immediately.</p>
<p>(4) One should not focus on historical relationships or emotional relationships, but on talent as the standard.</p>
<p>(5) Political officials should be judged by their understanding of policy and their ability to implement it.</p>
<p>(6) Content, or conduct a special examination, as the standard for appointment.</p>
<p>(7) One person, one position. Dual positions must not be allowed unless absolutely necessary. The above three major recommendations are all aimed at those that must be implemented immediately. This Assembly deeply hopes that the government will be aware of the seriousness of the domestic and foreign crisis, understand its duties, and diligently perform its duties, and no longer regard them as a mere formality. This is our deepest hope. (End)</p>
<h3>Responsible Persons of Trade Associations in the Recovered Areas During the Enemy and Puppet Period:</h3>
<p>Whether they are Traitors Has Been Explained</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] The question of whether the responsible persons of trade associations in the recovered areas during the enemy and puppet period are traitors has caused some doubt. According to reliable information, this issue has been decided by the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference. Whether a person who served as the chairman, director, or supervisor of a trade association within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppet regime is a traitor should be determined based on whether they committed any of the criminal facts listed in the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, and cannot be determined in general terms.</p>
<h3>Exporters Active, Beijing Pig Bristle Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Financial circles report: Due to the fixed exchange rate, exporters in the Southwest, Northwest, and Beijing-Shanghai areas have become very active. Various countries are now competing to purchase furs, pig bristles, and tung oil from China. The price of pig bristles in Beijing has risen to 360,000 yuan per dan (3 to 4 inches), pig hair to 42,000 yuan per dan, cowhide to 85,000 yuan per dan, and sheepskin to 1,200 yuan per sheet, and prices are still expected to rise.

<h3>Relief Deployment, Large Quantities of Supplies to be Transported to Northeastern Provinces, Madam Chiang is Planning to Care for and Educate Children</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Political news, after the government received the official news of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang, it has prepared to transport large quantities of supplies transported by the Relief Administration to China to the provinces of Cambodia via Qinhuangdao, to relieve the refugees who are suffering from famine due to war and banditry, some poor teachers, students, poor laborers, unemployed miners, and the families of martyrs who fought against the Japanese and puppets in various parts of the Northeast over the years will all receive relief in the form of flour or clothing, medicine, and milk powder. Plague has been discovered in the three major cities of Northeast China. Nine people have died in Changchun, two have died in Harbin, and four have died in Sipingjie. The Soviet army has taken epidemic prevention measures along the railway line, but due to the lack of medicines, the effect is minimal. After learning of this news, the government is consulting with the Relief Administration to send epidemic prevention experts to Changchun to provide relief. It is reported that Madam Chiang strongly advocates saving the Northeast refugees with food and medicine, and has personally requested Song Ziwen, Xiong Shihui, and Zhang Jia'ao to find ways to do so as soon as possible, because she once represented President Chiang to the Northeast and listened to the painful appeals of refugees in various parts of the Northeast.</p>

Marshall urged the United States to assist China as much as possible when the Nationalists and Communists are united, including material and financial assistance. He said that China's unity is necessary for world peace, and that the United States is best suited to assist China in achieving this stable situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Marshal Marshall arrived in Washington this morning and refused to comment on the current situation in our country. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included our Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming, US Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower, Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, and other senior Army officials. Despite the fatigue of the flight, Marshal Marshall was in good spirits when he got off the plane and smiled at the welcoming crowd to express his gratitude. At noon, Marshal Marshall, accompanied by Berns, met with President Truman and talked for an hour. He will hold a press conference on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 15th] Berns made a speech at a press conference today.

<h3>After the Continued Retreat of Soviet Troops from Changchun and Harbin, Sino-Soviet Negotiations Will Reopen; the Situation in Northeast China is Expected to Become Clear in the Near Future</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Chongqing News: With the National Army’s control over Shenyang, the turbulent situation in Northeast China is gradually becoming clearer. The world's anxiety over the issues of war spoils and economic cooperation on Northeast China's land will, after the continued withdrawal of Soviet troops from Changchun and Harbin, reopen the door to negotiations. This can already be glimpsed in the following news: (1) Both the United States and China have indicated that they do not intend to bring the Northeast China issue before the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Unofficial diplomatic activities between Washington and Chongqing, and between Chongqing and Moscow, concerning the resolution of the Northeast China issue, will undoubtedly be based on President Chiang's solemn statement that "economic cooperation must be discussed after the Soviet troops withdraw from Northeast China," as Soviet troops have already begun to withdraw from Northeast China. (3) Chongqing diplomatic circles deeply appreciate the Chinese government's painstaking efforts to safeguard world peace and maintain Sino-Soviet relations, and praise the President's statement as prudent, practical, and respectful of friendly nations' dignity, a sentiment shared by the Soviet Union. (4) President Chiang's statement implicitly suggests that the issue of war spoils in Northeast China and Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Northeast China may be resolved separately; the former should be reserved for further deliberation and joint decision by the Allied nations, while the latter should be based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, implementing previous agreements and engaging in sincere cooperation. (5) This morning, it is widely rumored in the capital that senior Northeast China officials in Chongqing are preparing to fly directly to Northeast China in the near future, and it is also revealed that some prominent figures from Northeast China residing in Chongqing will be invited to return home to assist the government, pacify refugees, and oversee the takeover. In light of all this, it is optimistic to expect that a clear and comprehensive solution to the Sino-Soviet dispute will be reached before the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Sources close to the Kuomintang have revealed that the Soviet Union will use Northeast China as collateral to negotiate with the United States. Judging from various signs, if the United States is willing to share the secrets of the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union, provide substantial loans, and make certain concessions, such as allowing the Soviet Union to establish land, sea, and air bases in Korea, so that the Soviet Union can ensure its security in the Far East, then the Soviet Union is prepared to withdraw its troops from Northeast China and provide the National Government with facilities to fully restore its sovereignty in Northeast China. If the United States refuses, the Soviet Union will repeatedly stall and continue to station troops in Northeast China, waiting for the Chinese Communists to gain strong control, establish an "autonomous regime," and implement Sovietization. In this regard, the Soviet Union has already discussed the "Manchurian Soviet" plan with the Chinese Communists, instructing them to launch an "autonomous" government in Northeast China to control the region and prevent National Government officials from promoting administration. According to this plan, the "autonomous" regime will be under the command of the Chinese Communists, and the Soviet Union will assist in forming a powerful army. The Soviet Union's actions are intended to prevent the United States from establishing a "defense line" in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Churchill's Speech at New York Welcoming Banquet: Soviet Union is Exerting Pressure on Iran and Turkey; The Security Council Should Handle It Immediately</h3>
<p>Denies Ever Advocating a British-American Alliance</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at a welcoming banquet held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here tonight. Present were ambassadors from nineteen countries, including the Iranian ambassador, but the Soviet Union did not participate. Before and after the speech, there were marches and demonstrations, with a mixture of booing and cheering. Churchill made a V-sign for victory and waved and smiled amid applause. Demonstrators carried posters that read "Britain Kicked Out Churchill, America Refuses Churchill!" and shouted "Churchill Wants War, We Want Peace!"</p>
<p>Churchill's speech advocated that the United Nations Security Council should handle the issue of the Soviet Union's failure to withdraw its troops from Iran, and that if the Soviet Union continues to exert pressure on Turkey, the Security Council should be asked to announce a verdict on the issue of the Dardanelles Strait. The United States and Britain proposed to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference to jointly guarantee the complete freedom of the Dardanelles Strait in peacetime and wartime, which Turkey would also gladly accept. However, the Soviet Union considered it insufficient. This is the first public announcement of the discussions on the Dardanelles Strait issue at the Potsdam Big Three Conference.</p>
<p>When discussing British-American relations, Churchill declared that he had never asked Britain and the United States to conclude a military alliance or military treaty. He only asked them to unite as brothers and form a free and independent friendly union. The growing closeness between our two countries is unstoppable, and the harmonious cooperation between the two countries is the main hope for maintaining world peace and human goodwill. This fact cannot be denied. He does not believe that war is inevitable or imminent. He does not believe that the Soviet rulers want to start a war at this time. The British and American people universally express sympathy for the Soviet people. If the Soviet government fails to use this feeling and instead disappoints and frustrates people, the responsibility will be entirely on them.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no reason to feel that its efforts in the war have not been adequately rewarded. Although its losses are regrettable, its gains are considerable. Germany and Japan, the two major enemies of the Soviet Union, have been defeated. Japan was almost entirely defeated by the United States alone, and the Soviet Union recovered almost all of its lost territories from forty years ago without firing a shot. In the West, the Baltic states and a large part of Finland have been incorporated into the Soviet Union. The Curzon Line is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>He was invited to freely express his views in this free country. He knows for sure that the hope expressed in his last speech to promote friendship between the two countries will be realized, not because of any speech, but because of the trends of personnel and the trends of fate. The situation has changed drastically in the past ten days, and the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, making it impossible for people to speculate. After he returns home, he may give another speech on the new situation. As for the recent events, there have been many misunderstandings, which he fully agrees with. He sincerely hopes that the Soviet Union will be peaceful and prosperous and occupy an honorable position in the world organization, which will not be diminished in the slightest. Whether the Soviet Union can do so depends solely on the decisions made by a few capable people under the guidance of their famous leader.</p>
<p>Churchill mentioned his speech in Fulton, Missouri, saying that he would never withdraw or change a single word.</p>
<p>New York Had Anti-Churchill Demonstrations</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] When Churchill toured here yesterday, posters reading "No American Wants to Die for Churchill" and "No Third World War" were found on Broadway. There were anti-Churchill demonstrations in front of City Hall, which clashed with the police, and twenty people were arrested. Police estimated that about 1,000 people in the demonstration were communists, and leaflets were distributed at that time with the message "Churchill Wants Your Children."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Maintain Close Contact to Clarify Tensions; Marshall May Be Sent to the Soviet Union as a Special Envoy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] According to the Washington dispatch of the London Evening Standard today: The US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary believe that in order to clarify the chaotic relationship between Britain and the US and the Soviet Union due to the situation in Iran, they have telegraphed each other to discuss the possibility of taking three actions: (1) President Truman can send a special envoy to Moscow to meet with Stalin. This special envoy may be Marshal Marshall, who has just returned to the US from China. (2) Britain and the US can jointly invite Molotov to Washington to hold a three-foreign-minister meeting to discuss all important issues. (3) All matters are left to the Security Council to handle, which will be held in New York on the 25th. Which of the three paths will be taken depends on the nature of the Soviet response to the British and American notes.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum: On Establishing "Provinces"</h3>
<p>— Tao Qiwu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>To gather tens of thousands of people into an army, it is necessary to organize them into several divisions, divisions into brigades, brigades into regiments, and regiments into battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. Only with proper order and a clear system can they be controlled, managed, deployed, and used in combat. Otherwise, they would be a disorganized mob, incapable of forming an army. The same applies to the implementation of governance by administrative organs. Below the central government, there are upper-level, middle-level, and lower-level administrative regions, delineated to facilitate the implementation of public affairs and ensure that principles are upheld, laws are established, and orders are enforced, ultimately achieving good governance. The "province" discussed in this article is one link in the upper-level administrative region.</p>
<p>Researching the "province" issue focuses on two key aspects: first, the "provincial area," which defines the spatial position of the "province" and specifies the scope of its authority; and second, the "provincial system," which stipulates how to exercise its authority within a certain area. The two are interrelated and inseparable.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The principles for dividing local administrative regions must respect historical elements. Within a country, each local people's group has its own special beliefs, languages, customs, habits, economic relationships, and ways of life. Over time, these gradually become a natural union, like an organism. If groups with different customs, habits, languages, and beliefs, and without economic ties, are forcibly combined into one, or if groups that are similar or have close relationships are forcibly divided into two, it will be enough to destroy the cohesion of the aforementioned organism, causing it to lose its spirit of cooperation and autonomy. Secondly, for the sake of facilitating governance, it is necessary to consider natural geographical features, population density, cultural level, and transportation conditions to create appropriate divisions.</p>
<p>The current provincial areas in our country undoubtedly violate the above two principles. For example, the people's lives, languages, and economic situations in Jiangnan and Jiangbei of Jiangsu are different, but the two are forcibly combined into one province. Furthermore, the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province make transportation difficult, but they are combined into one province, making governance extremely inconvenient. At that time, the alien rule, in order to accommodate the military situation and facilitate control, deliberately violated historical feelings and geographical environment, resulting in confusion and complexity. It should be re-divided and corrected.</p>
<p>In addition, the current "provincial" areas are too large, making governance inconvenient and conducive to separatism, hindering unity. Therefore, attention should also be paid to reducing the area so that the spatial distance between the people of the whole province is reduced, contact is closer, opportunities to exchange opinions and participate in public activities are increased, political knowledge and ability are easily enhanced, and autonomy interest and sense of responsibility are easily cultivated. This point is particularly important for future construction of "provinces."</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, provincial regions should be reduced in size and the unreasonable phenomena that are contrary to historical feelings and geographical environment should be corrected. The simplest method is to re-divide the current provincial regions according to historical evolution, geographical features, cultural, transportation and economic conditions. In this regard, I quite agree with Professor Zhang Qiyun's proposal. Except for the nine northeastern provinces which have been re-divided and will no longer be adjusted, the provinces in this part of the country, such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guizhou, can be divided into two provinces, north and south, according to the east-west mountain ranges and rivers; Shandong, Henan, Gansu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yunnan can be divided into two provinces, east and west. (For details, see Zhang Qiyun's recent paper published in the Chongqing Dagongbao; this article does not intend to discuss it in detail.) As for the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Kangding, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, I believe that the status quo should be maintained temporarily, and adjustments should be sought after local stability and social progress.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The area is only the body, and the system is the soul. If the provincial area is only reduced and the provincial system is not improved, and the "autonomous status of the province cannot be established, then under the current system, provincial affairs must be presided over and taken care of by the central government. With China's large area, the central government directly manages hundreds of local units; the remote areas must have difficulties in control and management. Therefore, it is inevitable to set up supervisory agencies above the province, becoming a disguised revival of the large provincial area, just like the reduction of prefectural areas in the Tang Dynasty, and the occurrence of circuits above the prefectures that are the same. Therefore, in order to achieve good results in reducing the provincial area, it must be supplemented by the establishment of a provincial autonomy system. According to Article 16 of the Outline of National Reconstruction: It is stipulated that "when all counties in a province have reached full autonomy, it is the beginning of the constitutional period. The National Assembly shall elect the governor of the province as the supervisor of the province's autonomy. As for the national administration within the province, the governor shall be under the command of the central government." The local administrative system resolved by the recent Political Consultative Conference also intends to determine the "province" as the highest unit of local autonomy. In modern democratic countries, the upper-level local administrative regions all have considerable autonomous organizations. Therefore, to make the provincial system sound, the most important point is to cultivate the autonomy interest and sense of responsibility of the people of the whole province, and to support and develop its organic nature. After the "province" is recognized as a local autonomous unit, the powers of the provincial council should be expanded to include at least: (1) the power to pass the provincial budget; (2) the power to legislate and review provincial single-line regulations; (3) the power to resolve provincial taxes and provincial public bonds; (4) the power to resolve the raising of provincial autonomous funds; (5) the power to impeach and denounce provincial officials; (6) the power to select the provincial governor; and (7) the power to suggest reforms to provincial administration (the current power to listen to reports, consult, and question is not enough).</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In addition to having a popularly elected council and a popularly elected governor, "provincial autonomy" must also have three conditions: First, it must have autonomous finances. Finance is the mother of all public affairs. Without autonomous finances, no autonomous undertakings can be carried out. The so-called autonomy will become empty talk.</p>
<p>In November of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), the National Government promulgated the revised outline for the implementation of the financial revenue and expenditure system, stipulating that the national financial revenue and expenditure should be divided into two systems: national finance and autonomous finance. Since then, the province as a level has no financial resources, and everything is controlled by the central government. Its due powers must also wait for the central government to distribute them at any time, and they are no longer fixed. Every move, every affair, and every object must rely on the national treasury to allocate funds. Under this situation, the provincial authorities become either unable to do anything or unable to do anything because there are no funds. Therefore, illegal taxes and fees (such as the goods transit tax levied by various provinces during the war) or the transfer of county autonomous funds are inevitable. In the past wartime, the government transferred the land tax to the central government in order to enrich military rations and food for the people, and abolished the "provincial finance" as a timely move. Now that the war is over and a full-scale demobilization is underway, and the autonomous status of the province will soon be recognized, the "provincial finance" should still be restored, and its financial resources are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tax revenue (including land tax, land improvement tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, use license tax, behavior control tax, land tax), (2) special tax revenue, (3) penalty compensation revenue, (4) fee revenue, (5) trust management revenue, (6) property and rights revenue, (7) provincial business revenue, (8) provincial business surplus revenue, (9) subsidy revenue, (10) property and rights sale revenue, (11) provincial public bond revenue.</p>
<p>The proportion of the above provincial financial revenue allocated to its affiliated counties and cities should be determined by the provincial council, and the funds required for matters entrusted by the central government should be allocated separately by the national treasury.</p>

<h3>Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate War Crime Evidence</h3>
<p>Keenan, the head of the International Prosecution Section of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo and Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal, led a group of members of the International Prosecution Section, including Hawks Hurston, Locke Liverlan, and Ningbao, flew to Shanghai by special plane from Tokyo yesterday morning, and arrived at Jiangwan Airport at about 5 pm, and went to the residence to rest. It is said that Keenan and others will meet with Mr. Xiang Zherong, our prosecutor who flew to this country four days ago, to investigate war crime evidence and consult witnesses. After a brief stay, he will fly to Chongqing with Mr. Xiang to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang. It is scheduled to return to Tokyo in ten days. Mr. Mei Ruao, the judge representing our country at the International Military Tribunal, will fly directly from Shanghai to the east, because the Tokyo Military Tribunal will begin hearing war criminals next month. The reporter visited Mr. Xiang Zherong at his residence in Huamao Apartment and asked about the organization and recent situation of the Far East International Military Tribunal. According to him, the Tokyo Military Tribunal was organized by the Allied Headquarters, and nine countries, including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, were invited to participate. Each country sent one prosecutor and one judge to form an organization. All major Japanese war criminals who have committed one of the following crimes: (1) violating peace, (2) violating the laws of war, (3) violating humanity, will be brought to trial by the International Military Tribunal and sentenced to the punishment they deserve. The Military Tribunal is now actively preparing the indictments of the war criminals, and the formal trial will begin next month. During the trial, the International Tribunal will give the defendants as much opportunity as possible to argue their case. Civilized countries under the rule of law should give the defendants considerable protection within the scope of the law. Therefore, the war criminals being tried can hire lawyers to defend them, and if they have not hired one, the court will appoint a defense lawyer. However, all the crimes of each war criminal can never escape the legal responsibility, because it is to punish the warmongers and to protect the permanent peace of the world and the happiness of mankind.</p>
<h3>British Tram Employees Welcome Released Representatives</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] Three representatives of the employees of the British Tram Company, Zhang Xuekui, Qiu Changjiang, and Peng Shaolin, were arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on suspicion of being attached to the rebels, and were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, which caused a strike.

<h3>Labor and Management Reach Agreement, Water and Wood Industry Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>Woolen Industry Dispute in Negotiation</p>
<p>The water and wood industry strike in this city has been resolved. Tens of thousands of employees have all returned to work, and labor and management have reached an agreement on wage issues. Carpenters receive 4,000 yuan per day, plasterers receive 3,900 yuan per day, and apprentices receive 40% of the regular wage, which is 1,600 yuan. Meals during working hours are still provided by the management.</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the woolen industry is still at a standstill due to the second occurrence of fighting. According to custom, the income of the industry's employees is divided into two types: Lijin (a kind of tax) and wages. Lijin is a kind of profit-sharing method, which depends on the level of business and the amount of clothes made. Generally, employees rely on this as their main source of income, and the wages are very meager, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Now the employees of the industry, because the fixed income of wages is too meager, demand the following improvements: (1) In the Nanjing Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 100,000 yuan, second-class employees are 90,000 yuan, and apprentices are 80,000 yuan. In the Linsen Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 80,000 yuan, second-class employees are 70,000 yuan, and apprentices are 60,000 yuan. In the Hubei Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 60,000 yuan, second-class employees are 50,000 yuan, and apprentices are 40,000 yuan. (2) Double salary and bonus for two months will be issued every December. (3) Meals will be provided by the management. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs will convene labor and management tomorrow to hold negotiations in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>

Yesterday, they also sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to request resumption of work.</p>
<h3>A Perfect Match, Double Happiness at the Door: A Record of Du Yuesheng's Two Sons' Wedding</h3>
<p>Cars on Taixing Road Form a Long Snake Formation, Lidu Garden is Unprecedentedly Lively [Special Report from this newspaper] Mr. Du Yuesheng held a wedding for his fifth son, Weihan, and sixth son, Weining, at Lidu Garden on Taixing Road yesterday. The ceremony was scheduled to be held at 3 pm, and the reporter rushed to the scene by car around 2 pm. The cars on Taixing Road were already connected in a long snake formation, entering the entrance one by one, disgorging their owners, and leaving the exit in turn, circulating endlessly. Rickshaws and tricycles could not find a gap to enter.</p>
<p>The entrance of the hall was densely packed with reception staff. It was difficult to squeeze to the signing place, write the name, receive a golden shield-shaped congratulatory badge and a small package of cigarettes, and rush into the hall. I only heard the people at the door shouting, "Quickly pin the congratulatory badge on the lapel, otherwise you will be refused entry." The guests did so one by one, and crossed into the hall in a crowd. It was inevitable to have a full tour of the hall to know that the host, Mr. Du Yuesheng, did not come due to illness, and everything was replaced by his eldest son, Weifan.</p>
<p>In the hall, I only felt that there were dark heads everywhere. Every available seat was occupied, every advantageous gap was filled, but the guests kept coming in droves, men, women, old, young, military, political, industrial, and commercial...people from all walks of life inevitably tended to bow three times to the platform.</p>
<p>Flower baskets filled both sides of the platform, congratulatory banners were stacked, and patched every corner of the hall, in the center of the platform, a red banner with the word "Doctor" sent by Chairman Chiang was hung high, and the names of Song Ziwen, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Qian Dajun...and other senior officials of the National Government were inlaid on the left and right. On the platform, golden shields, silver tripods, tall towers, and square frames were layered up one by one, like a gold and silver mountain, interweaving with the gold-lettered red banners on the wall to form a dazzling background. The Central Film Studio placed eight huge mercury lamps at the four corners of the hall, and eight strong rays of light were sprinkled on the platform and the aisle for the bride and groom. The camera stood high on the left corner of the platform, aiming the lens at the platform. More than a dozen Chinese and foreign photographers, holding camera cases, were busy looking for a suitable position.</p>
<p>At nearly three o'clock, the marriage officiant Qian Dajun, the introducers Huang Jinrong and Jin Tingsun, etc., appeared one after another. The master of ceremonies, Tang Zuanzhi, sang the beginning of the wedding into the microphone. After the officiant, marriage officiant, introducers, etc. took their seats, the wedding march began to play.</p>
<p>The grooms, Weihan and Weining, then stepped into the hall with a high head and broad strides, appearing in front of the platform. They were both wearing black ceremonial dresses, ironed flat, and they both looked quite fat, with Weihan being shorter. Then the brides, Yan Renyun and Chen Qingzhen, appeared with six flower-bearing little angels. They were both accompanied by someone, wearing pure white satin dresses, both with pearl flowers on their heads, and the veil hung to the ground, gently and slowly to the front of the platform. The two pairs of newlyweds began to form a neat row. The photographers began to mobilize, the silver light flashed, vying to leave this precious page.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian raised his voice and read the marriage certificate, the bride and groom exchanged ornaments, personally affixed their seals, and the officiant, marriage officiant, introducers, etc. stamped their seals one by one. The steps of the procedure were carried out quite quickly and skillfully. Then Mayor Qian gave a speech, saying: "Today, Mr. Du Yuesheng's two sons are holding a wedding at the same time, which can be said to be a double happiness. However, marriage is not only for bearing children, but also for seeking a fulfilling life and seeking progress in career. Fortunately, both pairs of newlyweds have complete education and will be able to love and help each other in the future, and their happiness will be infinite."</p>
<p>At this time, the atmosphere in the entire hall was boiling and the temperature was extremely high. Mayor Qian was sweating profusely when he finished his speech and hurriedly wiped it with a towel. Then Xu Jiching gave a congratulatory speech on behalf of the guests. Finally, the officiant Du Weifan thanked all the people presiding over the wedding ceremony and the guests on behalf of his father. The wedding ended in the bowing of the bride and groom to each other, and a commotion started under the platform. Red and green paper strips were scattered on the two pairs of newlyweds, and colored pieces of paper flew under the strong mercury lamps, reflecting brilliant and dazzling sparks, leading them to a path of eternal happiness.</p>

<h3>Deliberations on Establishing "Provinces"</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 2)</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates: "During this period, the powers of the central government and the provinces shall adopt a balanced system. Matters of a nationally uniform nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally adaptive nature shall be assigned to local authorities, without leaning towards either central autocracy or local decentralization."</p>
<p>"Provinces are recognized as the highest units of local self-government, possessing provincial assemblies, autonomous financial powers, and, moreover, autonomous undertakings. The most glaring shortcoming of the current provincial government organization law is its failure to specify what provinces should actually do. It merely states: 'Comprehensively manage all provincial affairs,' which is broad and vague. I personally believe that as national reconstruction work actively unfolds, provincial-level undertakings, except for nationally uniform affairs such as national defense, military affairs, justice, diplomacy, currency, and finance, which should be centrally planned and managed, other matters to be handled should be explicitly stipulated in the organization law, listing outlines as targets, so that the provincial authorities know what to do. In the future, when provincial governors compete in elections, candidates can also base their platforms on these outlines, publicizing their proposed methods to achieve the goals set in the outlines, and win the sympathy of voters. The scope of 'provincial undertakings' is generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Completion of province-wide household registration surveys and Baojia system reorganization; (2) Completion of province-wide land surveys, measurements, and land registration organization; (3) Completion of a province-wide health network; (4) Completion of a province-wide education network; (5) Completion of a province-wide telephone, highway, and waterway network; (6) Completion of province-wide wasteland reclamation, soil improvement, disaster prevention, and small-scale water conservancy projects; (7) Promotion of province-wide cooperative enterprises and public financial institutions; (8) Protection, initiation, assistance, and improvement of province-wide fishing, salt production, animal husbandry, sericulture, textile, and all rural sideline industries; (9) Widespread establishment of province-wide elderly care, childcare, and relief services; (10) Assisting province-wide people in finding employment, ensuring that farmers have land to cultivate, laborers have jobs to do, and entrepreneurs have opportunities to develop. With 'provincial' undertakings, autonomy will not be merely empty talk. The progress and expansion of provincial-level undertakings, taken as a whole, will also constitute the progress of the entire nation.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>According to the current provincial government organization law, the chairman of the provincial government is appointed by the National Government from among the members of the provincial government. The heads of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments are appointed by the National Government upon the recommendation of the Executive Yuan from among the members of the provincial government. This is the legal stipulation, but in practice, the members who also serve as department heads are mostly confidants of the provincial chairman. The members of the provincial government are political officials, but if a member also serves as a department head, based on the order of appointment, they should be considered political officials concurrently serving as administrative officials. In the future, the provincial government should adopt a governor system instead of a committee system. The provincial governor will still be a political official, elected by the people for a fixed term. The staff agencies below them, whether the heads of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments, or the heads of the secretarial, security, social affairs, land administration, agriculture and forestry, and food bureaus, should all be uniformly designated as administrative officials, selected by the central government's competent departments and nominated by the Executive Yuan for approval by the National Government. They should not advance or retreat with the political officials. In this way, various local self-government undertakings can be continuously promoted without being affected by political tides. This should also apply to the heads of bureaus and sections below the county level.</p>
<p>In executing their duties, the heads of provincial and county departments, bureaus, and sections are still subject to the supervision of the provincial and county magistrates, and shall act in accordance with the general administrative regulations of the provincial and county governments. However, they shall not be dismissed unless they are punished according to law or impeached by the provincial assembly. According to the above regulations, the successors of those who are dismissed shall still be nominated and appointed by the central or provincial competent authorities in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the "provincial" level has been the most problematic in Chinese local government. For thousands of years, it has never been satisfactorily resolved. The reason for Zhu Yuanzhang's success was centralism, leaving nothing for the local governments to do. Decentralization, on the other hand, led to secession. Dr. Sun Yat-sen pioneered the theory of balanced powers. In my opinion, the explanation of balanced powers should be two-fold: on the one hand, it should stipulate that "matters of a nationally uniform nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally adaptive nature shall be assigned to local authorities." On the other hand, it should maintain a balance between rule by people and rule by law, considering both the administration of law and the management of people. The above proposal to regard "provinces" as the highest units of self-government, with finances, undertakings, and powers, establishes the status of the province in terms of law. In terms of people, the provincial and county political officials are supervised by elected assemblies (of course, active military personnel should not be allowed to run for election), while provincial and county administrative officials are controlled by the central government, truly maintaining a balanced state, allowing the "province" to be fully engaged in governance while still being subject to effective central control and reasonable supervision, avoiding repeating the historical cycle.

<h3>Takahashi Seaside Resort to Regain Former Glory This Summer</h3>
<p>The Takahashi Seaside Resort was a popular recreational destination for Shanghai residents before the war. After the war, due to lack of management, all facilities were destroyed. It is learned that the Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to promote normal entertainment for citizens and encourage attention to health, has recently sent personnel to the original site to carry out repairs. It is expected that all work will be completed by May of this year, and the resort will be officially opened. It is said that in addition to the bathing beach, there are plans to add a library, entertainment room, sports ground, and dining room. At the same time, in order to facilitate tourists' travel, the bureau has purchased several 3.5-ton trucks from the CNRRA to be converted and used between Takahashi and the resort.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Detained in Huangdu, Authorities Send Personnel to Negotiate</h3>

Yesterday, when passing through the Huangdu area, they were detained by the local "Zhu Jing Advancement Association." Upon receiving the report, the grain merchants immediately applied to the grain administration authorities for negotiation. The bureau has, based on the report, telegraphed the provincial government for investigation and dispatched personnel to the location overnight, requesting the local administrative organs to stop the detention and release the boats immediately. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has started handling the registration of various companies in the recovered areas yesterday. The handling methods were approved by the Executive Yuan's 732nd meeting on February 5 of this year and announced on February 16 of this year. The methods consist of 21 articles.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Inspects Boilers</h3>
<p>Municipal Building Regulations to be Revised and Promulgated</p>
<p>In order to prevent fires in factories and protect the safety of factory premises, neighboring houses, workers, and the general public, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has sent personnel to various factories to investigate boilers, electrical equipment, and the layout of machinery. Factories with dangerous equipment have been instructed to relocate or improve their facilities. As of the end of February, more than 400 factories have been inspected and more than 800 boilers have been registered. Many small factories do not comply with the regulations or have failed to improve their facilities as instructed. It is said that the bureau is consulting with relevant agencies on how to handle this in order to thoroughly protect public safety. The city's previously promulgated building regulations were originally formulated in 1937 and have many deficiencies. The Public Works Bureau has now organized a Building Regulations Revision Committee, hiring civil, mechanical, and sanitary engineering experts from the city to revise the regulations in light of actual conditions. They will be promulgated and implemented soon.</p>

<h3>School Principal Knows Killer of Drunk Man</h3>
<p>Japanese National Denies Committing Murder</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda convened a session of the Second Criminal Division of the District Court to try a murder case. The case involved a Japanese national named Koyama Seishi, a 26-year-old male who had worked as an employee of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Company in Henan during the enemy occupation. After the Japanese surrendered, he came to Shanghai and lived at 30 Wenhua Villa, Shikumen Road, at the home of his friend Wazaki Kunio, an employee of the Ryusen Coal Mine Company. Other Ryusen Company employees, such as Nakaike Hitoshi, also lived there. Nakaike introduced him to Yoshida Masuzo, who pretended to be a watch repairman. Koyama also met a Chinese man named Chen. The two obtained seven watches from Yoshida and two from Nakaike, which they sold to a store designated by the US military in the former French Concession. The money they earned was used up. Later, Yoshida pressed them for payment, and Koyama decided to kill him. On December 12 of last year, on the pretext of going to withdraw money together, he lured Yoshida to a liquor store on US Road, got him drunk, took him to a nearby deserted place, hit him on the head with a stone, and slit his wrists with a knife until he saw him dying, before fleeing. Later, Yoshida recovered and managed to walk to the Fifth National Elementary School, where he collapsed. The principal, Iguchi Tsuguaki, discovered him, took him to the former Japanese Army Hospital for medical treatment, but he eventually died from his injuries. Before he died, he claimed that he had been harmed by Koyama Seishi. The 3rd Company of the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police arrested Nakaike Hitoshi and Koyama Seishi. They were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. At the first hearing yesterday, Koyama Seishi vehemently denied the charges, claiming that he had been at the Volga Cafe set up by Fang Qiang drinking tea between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., and that he had danced with a dance hostess named Yuri at the New Dance Hall. Judge Zhong ordered a postponement for further investigation and remanded the defendant in custody.</p>
<h3>Movie Theater Ticket Prices Adjusted</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Film Industry Association recently requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to raise movie ticket prices, aligning them with those of Peking opera theaters. However, the bureau did not approve this request because the number of shows and expenses of movie theaters and Peking opera theaters are quite different. It has now been stipulated that, starting yesterday, the prices for first-run movie theaters will be 1,800 yuan for the best seats, 1,600 yuan for the balcony, and 1,400 yuan for the main hall. Second-run theaters will charge 1,100 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 900 yuan. Third-run theaters will charge 700 yuan and 500 yuan, and fourth-run theaters will charge 600 yuan and 400 yuan.</p>
<p>The municipal government stipulates that the entertainment tax should be 50%, up from the previous 30%.

<h3>Drifting Mine Found in Waters Off Sheshan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Although the Allied US Navy has assisted in efforts to clear sea mines, it is difficult to completely clear them due to the vastness of the waters. Recently, they have been discovered from time to time. This is extremely important in relation to the navigation of ships.

<h3>High Court Trials of Traitors, Arguments Concluded in Four Cases, Verdicts Set for the 23rd</h3>
<p>The Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court at Tilanqiao held a panel hearing yesterday afternoon to try four cases of traitors. Arguments were concluded in all cases, and verdicts are scheduled to be announced at 2:00 p.m. on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Bohua: Served as a standing committee member of the puppet Lianglu Party Department, a counselor of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and deputy director of the Shanghai Office. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Chen in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors, because Chen repeatedly held puppet positions and admitted to the charges. The defendant claimed that he was ordered to carry out underground work before the victory, using his puppet positions as cover, and that he contacted various "cells" after the recovery to participate in demobilization work. He requested a particularly detailed investigation. After separate arguments by lawyers Huang Jiyuan and Zhu Yongkang, he was ordered to be remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>
<p>Gu Guoxiong: Served as an intelligence agent for the Nanshi enemy military police, claiming to be a former policeman who was transferred to a tea service role by the enemy military police. Defense lawyer Huang Jiyuan also argued that Gu only served as a tea server for the enemy military police and should not be included in the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors, requesting an acquittal. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Lu Xiling: A native of Jiashan, 24 years old, served as a clerk in the puppet Jiashan County Government in 1939. Between December 1942 and May 1944, he served as an informant for the Jiashan enemy military police, looting food and endangering the people. The High Court had sent a letter to the Jiashan District Court for investigation. The reply presented more than a dozen pieces of evidence of the defendant's crimes. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui read them out to him one by one, and the defendant did not deny any of the facts. After a final defense by lawyer Wang Shanxiang, the court ordered him to be remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Su Dehuai: 31 years old, a native of Anhui, joined the puppet Peace Army's 36th Division, serving as a second lieutenant adjutant, and later as a lieutenant medical officer. After the victory, he was arrested by the Lianglu Police Team for riding the train without a ticket and handed over to the court. The defendant is currently seriously ill and on the verge of death. He also confessed to serving in a puppet position. Lawyer Wang Shanxiang, appointed by the court, argued that the defendant served as a lieutenant medical officer, which was an appointed position, not the head of an agency, and should not be included in the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>

<h3>Three Allies of Salley are Arrested in Shanghai One After Another, Orloffsky Under Surveillance Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Four days ago, the General Headquarters of the Army secretly ordered the local military authorities to arrest three French and Russian police officers who had previously worked for the French Concession Police and had cooperated with the Japanese. All of them were allies of Salley and had spied on our intelligence during the war, providing it to the Japanese. One of them, Anmerinoff (Russian), had also worked for the Japanese Military Police on Rue Petain, which specialized in torturing and arresting our patriotic compatriots. One of them is former Deputy Chief Inspector Tong Bairu of the former French Concession Police, who was arrested on the 14th. It is said that Anmerinoff was captured by our authorities a month ago.

<h3>Supply Continues, Speculation Decreases, Gold Prices Become More Stable, Hong Kong Telegraphs and Rupees Settle Accounts</h3>
<p>Gold experienced a firm opening followed by a turn to weakness yesterday. The Bank of China continued its supply of 480 bars at a price of 1.6 million, and with this supply, the momentum was curbed. Credit was not as abundant as in previous days, and it became difficult to sustain in the afternoon. It opened at 1.64 million in the morning, struggling around 1.65 million for a while, but fell slightly due to selling pressure. At the time of the Bank of China's supply, it was around 1.62 million. After the supply of 1.6 million was secured, confidence was stabilized, and it retreated to the 1.6 million level, hovering around 1.59 million at noon. In the afternoon, there was continued selling pressure, and it stabilized slightly after reaching 1.57 million. As a result, it closed down 40,000 from the previous close. Jewelry gold was 172,000, silver ingots were 1,600, and silver dollars were being sold at 880 yuan. The implicit interest rate was initially loose and then tightened, with interest rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.22. The scope for speculation is narrowing daily, and it will be difficult for any disturbances to arise in the short term.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange US dollars were calm and narrow in range, with a sluggish process. It struggled around 2,050 yuan in the morning, but weakened slightly as the gold market became weak. However, the number was small, and it was still hovering around 2,020 yuan until noon. The situation dissipated in the afternoon, and there were even fewer transactions. As a result, it retreated 35 yuan. The Bank of China's US exchange rate was still listed at 2,020 yuan. Hong Kong tickets for old goods were boosted by 5 yuan due to the settlement of Hong Kong telegraphs by yarn merchants. New goods were stable after flatlining. Speculative funds continued to be collected. The 1936 issue rose to 125 yuan, and the 1937 issue rose to 123 yuan, and then became slightly erratic. As a result, it rose 10 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphs were 455 yuan, and rupees were 555 yuan, with both settling accounts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Opening Leads to Gradual Import and Export Activity</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank publicly opened applications for foreign exchange, import and export merchants in the city have been flocking to designated banks to apply for foreign exchange, causing extreme congestion. However, merchants are unfamiliar with the procedures, resulting in many having to make several trips. In reality, import merchants who import according to regulations face fewer restrictions. If the imports require permits, they must first apply to the "Imported Goods Management Office" for an import permit before applying for foreign exchange. For exports, exporters must first sell the foreign exchange earned from exports to designated banks before declaring the goods for export. Currently, imports ordered by merchants from Britain and the United States include automobiles, coal, cotton, cotton cloth, Western medicine, tobacco, white paper, and industrial raw materials. The cost of these goods, including shipping fees, is still lower than the market price, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai successively starting next month.</p>
<p>The city's export trade has been stagnant since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Now, with the official opening of foreign exchange, it is reviving. It is reported that countries in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia are currently in strong demand for our country's native products and handicrafts. To date, merchants from Britain, the United States, Belgium, and Southeast Asian regions such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Manila have sent telegrams to the city's Chamber of Commerce requesting trade introductions. The required Chinese native products and industrial products include more than twenty types such as porcelain, pottery, stone ornaments, batteries, straw hats, leather goods, peppermint, camphor, knitwear, and pork.</p>
<h3>Bulls Profit and Take Gains; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline; Speculative Funds Attack Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Government bonds are stable with no special changes. Only popular Class C bonds rose and fell by one hundred yuan, ultimately closing with a slight increase of twenty yuan. Classes A and B fell by eighty yuan, Class D by fifty yuan, and Class E by thirty yuan. Chinese stocks were initially stable but then declined. After some fluctuation, all stocks weakened slightly. This was partly due to securities firms taking profits. Foreign stocks failed to compete with Chinese stocks in recent days, but yesterday speculative funds from securities firms suddenly entered the market, resulting in favorable gains for Ewo Cotton, Ewo Brewery, paper companies, and Asian stocks, which rose by about ten percent, favored by those taking profits in Chinese stocks. Other stocks did not perform as well, with limited gains. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there were few transactions in Chinese stock futures, with only Yung Shing Cotton calling for 4,000 yuan, Meyer &amp; Co. at 3,080 yuan, and King Fook at 238 yuan, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Cashing Foreign Currency Bonds</h3>
<p>New Regulations Established</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank received a notice from the headquarters that, in order to standardize the procedures for cashing foreign currency bonds, the following regulations have been established: For the payment of principal and interest on gold bonds, if the amount in US dollars is less than ten dollars, or in British pounds is less than two pounds, it should be paid in national currency. If the amount is ten US dollars or more, or two British pounds or more, if the holder wishes to receive the original currency, in addition to filling out the application form for redemption and interest payment of government bonds, they must also fill out a list of applications for drafts and submit them together for verification. The aforementioned procedures for cashing foreign currency bonds have now been announced and are being implemented.</p>
<h3>Malayan Exchange Rate Determined: 1.56 Malayan Dollars Equivalent to 1,000 Legal Tender Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 15th Dispatch] The joint meeting of the responsible person of the Bank of China, the Director of the British Exchange Control Bureau, and our Consul-General has determined the exchange rate: 1.56 Malayan dollars equivalent to 1,000 legal tender yuan. This official exchange rate will be effective from the 18th of this month after the resumption of remittances from overseas Chinese to their home country. Each overseas Chinese family may remit 45 Malayan dollars to their home country each month. According to the Director of the Exchange Control Bureau, "family" refers to a single unit, including the head of the family, their spouse, and their children. Other relatives or non-lineal relatives of each family constitute another unit and have the right to remit separately.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Flat; Sales Obstructed by Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated slightly. In the morning, Shuang Ma (Double Horse brand) briefly rose to 1.08 million, but soon returned to 1.06 million. Weaving factories temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude and did not purchase due to inconvenience in sizing and dyeing caused by the rain. Customer sales were also hindered by the rain, resulting in a very flat market sentiment and little price change. The closing price was similar to the previous day's price. The Textile and Construction Company opened sales of serge, woolen fabric, thread, silk spinning, blankets, and other items totaling 26 types yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton report showed a drop of 4 to 28 points. The near-term price was 26.67 US dollars, the forward price was 26.37 US dollars, and the spot price of Middling cotton was 27.19 US dollars. There were no telegrams from Bombay regarding Indian cotton. The local cotton trade saw a significant decrease in activity because there were no special developments in the yarn and cloth market. The Textile and Construction Company has made considerable purchases in recent days, leading to a slightly cautious outlook. Only private Su Lun Yarn Factory purchased 200 bales of Middling cotton, and the Shen Hsin First Factory purchased 200 bales of Nantong Taicang cotton. No other factories or cotton merchants were reported to have made purchases. There was little change in market prices.</p>
<h3>Remnant Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth Case to be Submitted to the Political Council</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper News) The case of the city's dyeing, weaving, yarn, and cloth industries requesting the return of remnant enemy and puppet yarn and cloth was rejected by the Enemy Property Review Committee multiple times. The approval for the return of property to Yung Hsin, Yung Chang, and other five companies, which had been submitted to and approved by the Handling Bureau, was also invalidated. All yarn and cloth factories in the city were dissatisfied and urged their respective trade associations to fight for their rights according to the law. It is reported that in addition to jointly telegraphing the Second Plenary Session of the National Political Council to appeal, the trade associations also jointly hosted a reception for the political councilors in Shanghai last night. More than a dozen people including Zhang Shizhao, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Tingrui, and Tao Baichuan attended. The councilors inquired in detail about the circumstances of the purchase at the time, the process of applying for the return, and the changes in the authorities' approval and rejection. It is heard that the proposal will be submitted to the Second Session of the Political Council, requesting the government to provide a reasonable solution. The three trade associations also plan to send representatives to Chongqing to present all the details to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>More American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai; Coal Briquettes Also Imported</h3>
<p>The Ara Mazu, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Firm, arrived yesterday morning from bays such as Mobile, Houston, and Galveston, carrying 14,000 bales of cotton, purchased by American Annin and American Fruit companies. There were also 7,200 cases of relief canned food. It berthed at floating dock numbers 23 and 34 for unloading. Additionally, the Apex Victory, also managed by the firm, arrived from Mobile Bay with 10,460 bales of cotton and is expected to arrive today, scheduled to berth at Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>Coal briquettes were imported again yesterday. The British ship Mary Lyon arrived from Qinhuangdao with over 9,000 tons of coal briquettes, arriving at Yangjiadu Zhongzhan Wharf at around 4 pm yesterday to unload.</p>
<h3>Lingering Spring Rain; Grain Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market was cloudy and rainy, and the owners were very firm. However, store sales were sluggish, and the market was tight in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Japonica and indica rice increased by 500 to nearly 1,000 yuan, with some rare varieties commanding high prices, as supply and inventory were both exhausted, leading to a rapid increase of another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply and demand for flour were both scarce, temporarily remaining stable. The oil market was still acceptable, with a continued increase of nearly 1,000 yuan. Soybeans from Fujian were selling very well, with another increase of 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts remained unchanged, wheat bran was stable, soybean cake sales were strong, with a price increase of over 200 yuan. Corn was stagnant and flat, and vegetable cake dropped by 300 to 500 yuan, with flat sales.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>The tea market, which has been weak for more than a week, has not yet shown any signs of recovery. This is mainly due to the lack of purchasing power from buyers. In terms of price, because most owners who profited are eager to sell and seek cash, the market sentiment for some varieties continues to decline.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Declines</h3>
<p>The coal market declined because the supply was abundant and sales gradually slowed, leading to a soft market sentiment. Many parties were selling off, and there were few buyers, causing prices to decline. Coal dust and white coal dust experienced the biggest drops. White coal lumps are still in short supply, so the decline was slight. Due to the impact of rainy weather, there were not many shipments of firewood and charcoal, so the price remained stable at the original level.</p>
<h3>Goods from the Upper Yangtze River Flood into Hangzhou, Causing a Sharp Drop in Firewood Prices</h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: With continuous rain, the water level of the Qiantang River has risen sharply. Native products from the Upper Yangtze River, such as timber, firewood, charcoal, and oil, have arrived in Hangzhou in large quantities. The Railway Bureau is currently allocating cars to transport them to Shanghai. Currently, miscellaneous firewood in Hangzhou is 2,300 yuan per load, pine firewood is 1,400 yuan per load, and green charcoal is 7,000 yuan per load, all of which are more than double the prices in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Copper, Tin, and Hardware Soften; Only Refined Tin Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The market conditions for steel, tin, and hardware, which had been vibrant for a week, have returned to calm, trending downwards. The decline has been most pronounced in lead, with a drop of about 40%. Pure copper is currently selling for 3.2 million yuan per ton, a decrease of 20%. All other goods have declined, with only refined tin remaining firm.</p>
<h3>30,000 Boxes of Soap Distributed to Small Retailers</h3>
<p>The city's 3,000-plus small retailers of tobacco and foreign goods previously protested against the Enemy Property Handling Bureau's distribution of goods only to large retailers, demanding fair distribution to all retailers, large and small. The Bureau has responded by offering 30,000 boxes of assorted brand soaps for distribution to small retailers for sale. The Bureau will also allocate mosquito coils, priced at 7,000 yuan per box for the large size, with each household allocated 50 boxes, limited to the original household name.</p>
<h3>Market News in Brief</h3>
<p>Timber: Yesterday's timber market trend remained poor, and trading was difficult to stimulate, with prices hovering at low levels.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: The market became weaker again, with few shipments. The previous allocation of goods from Brunner Mond &amp; Co. is scheduled to be shipped next week.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Organizes National Education Work Competition</h3>
<p>Civil Education Class as the Center of the Competition</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education believes that the National Education Work Competition held by various counties in previous years has not been widespread or seriously implemented, so the effect has been minimal. This year, it should continue to be held to achieve perfection. Therefore, it has issued the "Notes on Matters That Should Be Attended to in the National Education Work Competition Held by Various Counties This Year," and ordered the various commissioner's offices and county governments to earnestly comply with them. The notes are outlined below: (1) This year, each county should focus on strengthening the civil education class in national schools at all levels as the center of the competition. (2) National schools at all levels, the chiefs of various townships and villages, and personnel involved in promoting adult education should all participate in the competition. (3) The competition standards for national schools at all levels are whether the civil education class is effectively implemented in accordance with regulations, and whether the number of students in adult classes or women's classes is sufficient. The competition standards for township and village chiefs are to assist national schools at all levels in recruiting students for adult classes and women's classes. The competition standards for other personnel are the results of assisting schools in various counties in handling civil education. (4) The competition period is from March 15th to December 15th. (5) Before the end of December, each county should select the three best schools and the three most effective township and village chiefs and other personnel, fill out three report forms in detail, and submit them to the commissioner's office for verification and reward. The next best will be verified and rewarded by the county government, and the worst will be punished as appropriate, and the names of the rewarded and punished schools and individuals will be publicly announced. (6) Before the end of January of the 26th year, each commissioner's office should select the three best counties, together with two copies of each county's report form, filling in the number of schools, the number of classes held in the upper and lower halves of the year for adult classes and women's classes, the number of students, and the percentage of the total number of out-of-school people in each county, and forward them to the Education Department for verification and reward. (7) The commissioner's offices and county governments may, in accordance with these notes, formulate additional competition measures to supervise and implement them.</p>
<p>The matter of accommodating returning students from the rear was also discussed. Currently, there are more than 6,000 middle school students from the rear studying in the province. In addition to the collective relocation of the 12th Middle School to the east, there are more than 4,000 students who need to be accommodated. However, some school buildings are occupied by military units and agencies, and appeals should be made by the Provincial Council and the Provincial Education Association to the relevant competent authorities to have the troops withdraw. A committee should be established to conduct a thorough and thorough investigation in order to restore the school buildings and accommodate the students from the rear.</p>

<h3>Various Circles in Hubei Hold Symposium to Accommodate Returning Personnel and Students</h3>
<p>Appealing to the Military to Withdraw from School Buildings</p>
<p>[Ta Hua News Agency, Hankou News] The Hubei Provincial Education Association invited people from all walks of life to hold a symposium to address the urgent need to accommodate returning teachers and the difficulty of resuming classes due to the military's presence in schools. The meeting was attended by Speaker Shen, Director Qian, Senator Li, and more than 50 school principals. After discussing the accommodation of returning teachers from the rear and the personnel who passed the qualification examination in the recovered areas, they unanimously agreed that personnel from the rear should be accommodated first, followed by those who remained in the province. Currently, there is a surplus of teachers in Wuhan, while there is a shortage of teachers in northern and western Hubei. Although there are many factors contributing to this, the main reason is the poor treatment in the outer counties.</p>

<h3>City Elementary Schools Request Improved Treatment; Petitioned the City Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Deputy Mayor He Received Them, But No Results Were Obtained</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association, requesting the city government to improve treatment and increase education funding, hosted a press conference the day before yesterday to report on the progress and issued an open letter to citizens from all walks of life, appealing for assistance. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, they sent representatives Chen Yuxian, Wang Liben, Fan Xixuan, Yu Zhengchao, and Cao Junshi to the city government to petition. Deputy Mayor He Dekui received them.</p>
<p>Proposed Three Demands. First, the representatives put forward the following three demands: (1) Issue subsidies based on the basic salary, according to the cost of living index; (2) Education funding should account for 20% of municipal expenditures; (3) Currently, each person is borrowing 150,000 yuan. Deputy Mayor He replied that, constrained by central government orders, the improvement of the treatment of teachers and staff cannot be implemented alone, and the other two items cannot be achieved with the current municipal financial situation, and so on. Finally, he earnestly instructed the representatives to convey to the teachers and staff that education is the most important thing, to be mindful of the difficult times, and to endure the temporary pain, and if the government has the strength, it will certainly try its best to find a way, and so on. The conversation continued until 12:30 PM, but no concrete results were obtained. The representatives then withdrew.</p>
<p>Another Meeting Convened. It is heard that the association is now scheduled to convene a joint meeting of directors and representatives again next Tuesday at 4:30 PM at Bide Elementary School to report on the progress and discuss future actions.</p>
<p>[Further News] The delegation of teachers and staff of municipal secondary schools in this city did not petition the city government yesterday. It is because the delegation had previously sent members to petition, but no results were obtained. How to proceed in the future will still be jointly and consistently determined with the Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association.</p>
<h3>National Education Classes</h3>
<p>The City Will First Open 400 Classes</p>
<p>[Our City News] In this city, there are many children who are out of school, and only half of the school-age children are enrolled. There are an estimated two million illiterate adults. In order to alleviate the lack of education and eliminate illiteracy, the City Education Bureau plans to use the school buildings of public and private primary and secondary schools to open national education classes. In the near future, 400 national education classes will be opened, which will increase the number of enrolled children by 20,000 and the number of enrolled adults by 40,000. Public and private school buildings and school equipment will be used as much as possible, and the original school teachers and staff can also serve concurrently.</p>
<p>Children's Classes in the Afternoon, Adult Education Classes in the Evening. Appropriate public and private primary and secondary schools will be designated to start classes earlier and open national education classes. Tentatively, children's classes will be held in the afternoon and adult education classes in the evening. The number of classes will be determined by the Education Bureau. The curriculum and teaching hours of children's classes are the same as those of ordinary primary schools. All public and private primary and secondary schools may be designated by the Education Bureau to establish half-day primary schools and mass education classes, collectively referred to as national education classes. Half-day primary school classes should give priority to accepting newly enrolled children.</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Hours for Mass Education Classes. Mass education classes should try to enroll out-of-school adults. Each class will have a standard of 50 people, and the number of classes will be determined by the Education Bureau. The curriculum and teaching hours of half-day primary school classes are the same as those of full-day schools. The curriculum and teaching hours for mass education classes are planned to be 50% for national language, 25% for general knowledge, 20% for arithmetic, and 5% for music. The total number of hours for the entire period should not be less than 200 hours. It is heard that the measures for promoting national education to alleviate the lack of education and eliminate illiteracy have been approved by the 24th Municipal Affairs Conference.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Finals; Gymnasium Packed; Hualian Team Defeats Sakor; Leading All the Way with a Score of 65 to 49; Championship Within Reach; Performance Exquisite</h3>
<p>Last night, the Hualian basketball team defeated the Sakor team, organized by personnel from the U.S. Naval Headquarters, with an exquisite performance. The result was 65 to 49, with Hualian leading 37 to 25 in the first half. Afterwards, Hualian will face the Enkas汕 team twice. Barring any accidents, the championship of the Shanghai Basketball League Group A is firmly in the hands of Hualian.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Grandeur. From 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, fans flocked to the city gymnasium. By 7:00 PM, it was so crowded that there was no room to stand. It is estimated that there were about 4,000 fans, with the second and third floors completely full. It was truly an unprecedented grand occasion for basketball games in recent years. Mayor Qian and City Government Secretary-General Shen attended the game with their wives. The Garrison Headquarters also sent guards to maintain order. Every time Hualian scored a basket, cheers thundered.</p>
<p>Zhenzhong is the Main Player. All six players of Hualian took to the court. Li Zhenzhong was still the main player. He was brought back in the second half, and the situation was stabilized. Bao Songyuan was also particularly outstanding. The whole team can be said to have performed at its best. Sakor still had some fight in the first half, but was in a state of confusion in the second half. After the game, the person in charge seemed to admire Hualian's performance, but blamed the slippery water-cement floor, saying that they would not play here again next time. Smooth Progress. Referees Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng. Hualian first used the five tigers of Zhenzhong, Guangyi, Xuechong, Chengzhang, and Liangxiong. Sakor's He Tuolais first scored, and Chen Xuechong immediately returned a goal. Anderson scored two. Six to two was the only lead Sakor had in yesterday's battle. Afterwards, the wonderful shots of Hualian's Chen Xuechong and Wu Chengzhang were seen. Six to six, until each had twelve, Hualian suddenly gained momentum. Li Zhen commanded calmly, and the whole army progressed smoothly. At the end of the first half, they led with a score of 37 to 25.</p>
<p>An Irresistible Force. In the second half, Zhenzhong rested and Bao Songyuan was brought on. Sakor took advantage of the situation and the score gradually approached, from 39 to 32 to 41 to 35, with a difference of only three goals. Zhenzhong re-entered the field and Zhang Liangxiong retired. The momentum was indeed stronger, and Hualian became an irresistible force, defeating Sakor with a score of 65 to 49.</p>
<p>Although yesterday's game was said to be extremely exciting, the slippery court was indeed a reality. Chairman Chang of the Basketball Committee spoke to Mayor Qian about this point. Mayor Qian is the chairman of the Sports Association, so he has agreed to find a way to lay the floor in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Today's Soccer Postponed</h3>
<p>All the schedules for today's soccer league have been postponed due to the wet and unusable field. The date of the Group A East China Qingbai match has not been determined. Next week will be the Mayor's Cup.</p>
<h3>Special Education News; New Initiatives in International Cultural Cooperation (Part 1)</h3>
<p>National Normal College Establishes Educational Materials Room</p>
<p>In order to study education, cultivate excellent teachers, the Ministry of Education resolved in 1938 per the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council to restore higher teacher education. Aside from reorganizing the departments of education at the National Central University, Zhejiang University, Southwest Associated University, Northwest Associated University and Zhongshan University into Normal Colleges, they tentatively created an independent, national teacher training institution in Lantian, Hunan, called the National Normal College, to serve as a model for the nation. The college was established seven years ago. Under the leadership of President Liao Shicheng, who took over the leadership, the college has been painstakingly managed and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the college agreed with Columbia University in the United States to exchange research data, which is a rare new initiative in international cultural cooperation during the war. The college has specially set up an Educational Materials Room to handle this matter. Although the Educational Materials Room has not been established for long, its work has been effective. The current situation of the room will be explored and recorded below, to inform readers.</p>
<p>Reasons for Establishment</p>
<p>In the spring of 1944, Columbia University in the United States, in order to promote international cultural exchange, entrusted Dr. Wu Yifang, the president of Ginling Women's College, to introduce the matter to Dr. Liao Shicheng, the president of the National Normal College. They agreed on several methods for exchanging research data, the main points of which are: (1) To exchange subscriptions to educational periodicals published in China and the United States since the outbreak of the war; (2) To exchange purchases of new educational works published in China and the United States in recent years; (3) To compile and exchange catalogs of educational publications published in China and the United States since the outbreak of the war; (4) Columbia University's Teachers College Library will donate one copy of each of the important educational books in its collection that have duplicates to the National Normal College. In order to carry out this exchange work, to promote international cultural cooperation, and to collect domestic and foreign educational materials to facilitate educational research, the college specially established the Educational Materials Room in the spring of 1945 to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Current Staff. After the establishment of the Educational Materials Room, President Liao hired Dr. Zhu Youguang, a professor at the college who graduated from Columbia University, as the director. Mr. Feng Zengzhu is the clerk.</p>
<p>The internal advisors of the room have also been appointed by the president (in order of stroke count of surnames): Wang Shilu, Zhu You, Ruan Yanming, Meng Xiancheng, Guo Yicen, Cheng Zongchao, Zhang Wenchang, and Qian Yaxin. As for the external advisors and correspondents, they are still being selected and hired. In addition, in order to handle various affairs, Qiu Weicheng, Liu E'ye, Lu Jingxiu, Chen Renyu, and He Chang, five students from the Xupu and Lantian Student Relief Committees, were successively requested to come to the college to take charge of drawing, clipping, document writing, and managing books and newspapers, respectively.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Following Marshal Ma's Inspection Tour (4): Influential Figures of the Past Will Become Pillars of the Peace Era</h3>
<p>— Sent by Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Beiping</p>
<p>The Xuzhou meeting on the evening of the 2nd lasted from 8:00 PM after dinner until 12:00 AM. During the meeting, everyone argued until their faces were flushed, and even Marshal Ma couldn't help but lose his temper. The New Fourth Army in this area hoped for the following: (1) The Communist army would withdraw from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in exchange for the Guomindang army's garrison north of the Grand Canal. (2) The Communist army would garrison the cities they had surrounded. (3) Obstacles on the transportation lines would be removed. (4) The government army would withdraw from the Zhongxing Coal Mine, and the coal mine would be managed by merchants. The final result of the three-party negotiations was: (1) All obstacles hindering traffic on the transportation lines would be removed, but the fortifications that did not hinder traffic would be preserved. (2) Both the Communist and Guomindang armies would withdraw from the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which would be jointly managed by the government, the Communist Party, and merchants, with the assistance of American engineers. According to Director Gu Zhutong, three thousand government troops were surrounded in this mine, and the Communist army had already seized two of the three mine shafts. The remaining mine shaft could not be used because the drainage equipment was isolated, and water was accumulating in the mine daily. If it was not resolved quickly, the mine shafts would be flooded.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai's Speech: Clearly a Match</p>
<p>At the Xinxiang meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd, the Communist representative of the initial executive group initially used the Guomindang army's withdrawal from Meng County to relieve the siege of Yongnian and Dongming in southern Hebei as an exchange condition. Marshal Ma instructed that each issue should be resolved rationally and individually, and should not be entangled with each other, which would only increase disputes. The intelligent Mr. Zhou Enlai then stood up to speak, explaining that according to the ceasefire agreement and the order of the executive headquarters, the military and civilians in all besieged cities should be able to receive food supplies, and transportation should be restored as soon as possible. As a result, a problem that had been entangled for many days was largely resolved. The reporter should also report that Yongnian had been besieged for several months, and it is said that the bark of the trees in the city had been eaten clean. Recently, there have been reports of cannibalism, and it was truly a situation that had to be resolved.</p>
<p>The Taiyuan meeting that evening was the second most intense debate since Xuzhou. However, the principles of supplying food to the besieged military and civilians and rapidly restoring transportation were established.</p>
<p>The trip to Guihua on the afternoon of the 4th was more of a visit. The Sui-Bao area was generally peaceful. The recent Guihua team had also returned to Beiping and had not returned. It is said that the commander gave a speech at the welcome banquet, stating that under the premise of peace, he did not want to mention some minor conflicts. His only hope at present was to restore transportation as soon as possible. Zhou Enlai's speech was also well-matched. He said that he had ordered the Communist troops not to mention any more minor incidents.</p>
<p>Review of Peace: Approaching the Last Day</p>
<p>That evening, during a visit to Yan'an, Ma, Zhang, Zhou, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De exchanged opinions extensively on domestic and foreign issues, without discussing any specific problems.</p>
<p>The 5th was the last day of the peace review. Ma, Zhang, and Zhou met with the Hankou team and the government and Communist military officers in the secluded and beautiful Yang Sen Garden in the suburbs. Although conflicts in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui had ceased and things were peaceful, the Communist army led by Li Xiannian, due to a lack of food, requested to move to Wuhe in northern Anhui to find food, which caused the military three-person group a great headache. The government side was deeply afraid that the transfer of tens of thousands of troops over a thousand miles would affect public morale and local order. Minister Zhang Zhizhong immediately asked Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan to assist Commander Li Xiannian in solving the food problem. If necessary, the government could also provide them with loans to purchase food. As for the future, whether Li's troops would move to Wuhe County in northern Anhui would be decided after returning to Chongqing. This issue was not a new one. Large armies were gathered in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the food of the people was completely exhausted. As early as then, Li Xiannian's troops requested to move to Wuhe to find food. The Hankou executive team sent an English telegram to the Beiping executive headquarters, and the translator translated "Wuhe" as "Wuhu." Government Commissioner Zheng Jiemin was very angry when he saw it. "What? You want to send 40,000 troops to Wuhu? Do you want to seize Nanjing?" As a result, the issue was put aside.</p>
<p>"The most amazing thing is that a ceasefire situation was created in the shortest possible time. This miracle signifies understanding and goodwill, which is a most important factor." (Marshall)</p>
<p>The past eighteen years of Chinese history are like a large circle formed by two lines merging together. Initially, one line went east and one line went west. They once became completely different north and south poles, but finally they met and merged at one point.</p>
<p>"Personal feelings are partial and unimportant." "In this stage, perhaps some people will have to be sacrificed, but this sacrifice is beneficial to the majority." (Marshall)</p>
<p>Here, let us review the figures who once dominated the scene and who should become pillars of peace in the future!</p>
<p>Going to Zhangjiakou: First Meeting with General He Long</p>
<p>On the first day in Zhangjiakou, I saw He Long for the first time. In the fierce Sui-Bao battle, he had not died in battle as rumored. Of medium height, he looked neither fat nor thin, a rather sturdy middle-aged man. He always had an unpretentious, rough pipe in his mouth. When he spoke, the short mustache on his lips moved slightly, and his Hunan accent, which was similar to Sichuan dialect, expressed his strong will, boldness, and mischievousness. His signature was also flamboyant, full of heroic spirit. His criticism of the ceasefire order was: "Very good." And like most Sichuan people, he especially prolonged and emphasized the word "very." He did not feel any difficulty in implementing the troop reduction plan, saying that the surplus officers and soldiers could go home to farm, and those who did not have land would be given money. He fiercely criticized Li Shouxin's troops in a sarcastic tone. This conversation with him did not take place in Zhangjiakou, but at the Jining airfield. "We don't even have a house at this airfield," General He Long said with a sigh and full of hope, "In the spring, we plan to build a few houses." The desire for peace and construction had clearly risen in the heart of a general who wanted to crush the existing society. In Zhangjiakou, at the same time as seeing He Long for the first time, I saw Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region, and Nie Rongzhen, commander of the Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar Military Region. Xiao Ke had a long, thin face and was gaunt, like a slightly older high school graduate from a small county town, with a bit of a rural air. Nie Rongzhen was a fair-skinned scholar, gentle and refined, wearing an expensive fine woolen military uniform. It is said that he had studied in France and was also a handsome figure in the Communist army.</p>
<p>Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army: Saying that from now on, they will only argue</p>
<p>General Wang Yaowu, who became famous in the Battle of Xuefeng Mountain in western Hunan, is now in the besieged city of Jinan, which has a diameter of thirty or forty miles, shouldering a very arduous task. Unfortunately, due to the short time in Jinan, I was unable to hear his conversation. I only asked him to sign his name at the airfield. The characters were written in a very generous manner, and the character "Wu" was almost written as the character "Sheng," with an extra dot. Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, was tall and burly, with a round face and glowing red complexion, wearing a grassy green coarse cloth military uniform. This general, who boasted of "leading 300,000 troops," is said to have studied electrical engineering in France. The day before Ma, Zhang, and Zhou arrived in Jinan, he and Li Yu, chairman of the Communist Party of Shandong, flew from Linyi to Jinan together. Wang Yaowu and He Siyuan personally greeted them at the airport. That night, Wang and He held a grand banquet. After drinking and eating heartily, "Zuo Min!" (Wang Yaowu's courtesy name) Chen Yi, with a flushed face from drinking, said, "From now on, we are only allowed to argue, not to fight." He Siyuan added, "We only argue indoors and don't make noise outside." In his conversation with reporters, Chen Yi did not admit that the Communist army of Shandong was surrounding the Guomindang army. "If you say it is a encirclement, isn't there a larger Guomindang encirclement outside the Communist army's encirclement?" He also refused to express his opinion on the troop reduction, believing that it was still too early.</p>
<p>Director Gu Zhutong: Arousing Infinite Memories</p>
<p>In Xuzhou, we saw Director Gu Zhutong. He is probably the pacification director with the greatest power. The jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters not only includes the complete provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, but also extends to northern Anhui and eastern Zhejiang, with twenty armies, which will be reorganized into twenty divisions. However, he does not feel any difficulty, saying that the reorganization will begin on the 16th. Not long ago, he suffered from typhoid fever, and his complexion is still a bit sallow. On the morning we left Xuzhou, we were received by Director Gu. The current surging tide of peace has rekindled many of his memories. He said that he had been old friends with Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying for more than twenty years. After the Xi'an Incident, he presided over the Xi'an Executive Headquarters. At that time, he had two tasks: one was to be responsible for reorganizing Zhang and Yang's troops, and the other was to negotiate military and political issues with the Communist Party. At that time, he had a week of negotiations with Zhou Enlai. The theme of the negotiations was also the nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics. Unfortunately, no results were achieved. All the negotiation processes were recorded in his wife's own handwriting, secretly treasured, and never made public. After ten years, now witnessing the success of the ceasefire and the political consultative conference agreement, he sincerely feels happy. He judges that the Communist Party will implement the agreements of the political consultative conference on ceasefire and troop reduction, because every far-sighted Communist will realize that without doing so, the Communist Party has no future.</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Welcomes Marshal Ma: Enthusiastically Arriving in Xinxiang</p>
<p>Director Liu Zhi rushed from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang to welcome Marshal Marshall. He still had a round face, a radiant complexion, and retained the aura of a "lucky general." At the Xinxiang meeting, he said, "I am a soldier, and obedience is my bounden duty. I obey all the orders of the Executive Headquarters," which left a deep impression on people. Although Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist 129th Division and commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, was most easily recognized by one eye, several of our colleagues did not find him. It is said that someone asked him if he had the sincerity to implement the ceasefire order, and his answer was, "If I had no sincerity, I would not have come at all." While Ma, Zhang, and Zhou were holding a meeting in Xinxiang, we took a break to visit General Ma Fawu, who had just been released by the Communists. He had been a student of the Peking Union Medical College, gentle and refined, almost like a pastor. He refused to say anything about the circumstances of his capture and the situation in the Communist area, saying that he had been sick there all the time and was still not well. Finally, he told a long story about his military service and the history of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>On the night of arrival in Taiyuan, we were very tired and went to bed early. After midnight, someone from the Chief Executive's Office of Foreign Affairs knocked on the door, saying that Governor Yan wanted to see us. Everyone hurriedly rubbed their sleepy eyes, dressed, and got into the car to enter the city. That night, Governor Yan was wearing a brand-new yellow woolen military uniform specially made to welcome Marshal Marshall, with shining spiked riding boots, and the three-star general's collar badges were also glittering. However, the general, who had been the master of Shanxi for thirty-five years, was indeed old. He walked with a trembling gait, and looked at us young people with an expectant but lonely gaze from under his large glasses. The next morning, before Marshal Marshall was about to board the car to go to the airport, Governor Yan, as if he had suddenly remembered something he had forgotten, found our four reporters again in the reception room and told us his newly discovered political philosophy: "To eliminate the threat of war, we must first have a correct understanding, that is, under different standpoints, there are absolutely no common interests, personalities, and right and wrong. It is wishful thinking to ask the other party with a different standpoint to keep their promises. Not keeping their promises is precisely their personality, precisely their revolutionary means. We should forgive them." In a hurry, none of us were able to understand this heartfelt conversation clearly. Was he trying to raise everyone's awareness? Or was he teaching Jesus's doctrine: "Love your enemies"? In the conversation the night before, a reporter asked Governor Yan if he had spoken with Liu Bocheng. "Not yet!" he said. "He was my old subordinate. I commanded him in the early days of the War of Resistance. We are very familiar."</p>
<p>Communist Officer Chen Geng: Reuniting with Zhang Zhizhong</p>
<p>On the evening of the 3rd, on the stairs of the Fuxing Hotel, I also saw Chen Geng [chief of the Communist army in southern Shanxi], short and wiry, wearing a gray military uniform, greeting warmly. Later, Minister Zhang told reporters that Chen Geng was from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. They had not seen each other for more than ten years. That night, Chen Geng specially went to his room to talk for a long time, very affectionately. Over the years, how many superiors and subordinates, teachers and students, who had parted ways, shook hands again in the torrent of peace!</p>
<p>General Zhou Enlai: Received in Guihua</p>
<p>Arriving in Suiyuan, I saw General Fu Zuoyi. He was still as energetic as the reporter had seen him in Shabam during the War of Resistance, wearing a soldier's uniform. At the tea party welcoming the three guests, many people were looking for General Zhou Enlai. Fu introduced at this time, "This is General Zhou Enlai." Everyone laughed. Zhou Enlai's speech was always beautiful. He said, "We have always admired Commander Fu's achievements in the War of Resistance. The misfortune of history has made us stand against each other, causing the people of Suiyuan to suffer. I would like to extend my condolences to the people of Suiyuan. Now we are at peace, and we will always be at peace. Let the past be the past!" In this moving scene of peace, two months ago, when Suiyuan and Baotou were stained with blood, how could the parties involved have imagined it?</p>
<p>In Yan'an, I saw General Zhu De for the first time. Although he was over sixty years old, he was still as strong as a bear. Wearing a gray cotton military uniform covered with dust and oil stains, he was no different from a soldier, and even no different from a cook. At the evening party in Yan'an, he represented the Communist Party and said, "We, the Chinese Communist Party, with all our enthusiasm, are willing to realize China's peace, democracy, unity, and construction under the leadership of Chairman Chiang." Looking back, last year, just after Japan surrendered, Zhu De sent Chairman Chiang a telegram full of sparks, referring to "your government" and "your army." We can easily realize how much progress Chinese history has made in the past six months of unreasonable warfare!</p>
<p>Hankou Welcome Party: Marshal Ma Praises Guo and Li</p>
<p>At the welcome dinner in Hankou, Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan and Communist Commander Li Xiannian's faithful implementation of the ceasefire order and sincere cooperation won Marshal Ma's praise. General Guo Chan was the old garrison commander of Hankou. He was not tall, had a fair complexion, and was very sturdy. This time, Director Cheng Qian of the Wuhan Executive Headquarters went to Chongqing for a meeting, and he temporarily took the place of the host. Commander Li Xiannian said that he had been to Hankou twice. After the ceasefire, he had become very familiar with Hankou. He was from Huangpi, had a thin face, and looked like he was malnourished. The situation of his troops was in contrast to Chen Yi's situation in Shandong. He got along very well with the executive team. Marshall reported at the banquet, "I received a letter from General Li, expressing his regret for Colonel Ford's departure from the Guangshan team, and promising that he would continue to cooperate closely with his successor, Colonel Colebrook. I believe that this is a ray of light in a pessimistic atmosphere. I express my thanks for that special sincerity." (February 13)</p>

<h3>US Air Force Personnel Awarded Chinese Medals</h3>
<p>Our people should recall that in July 1943, Madame Chiang had a trip to the United States. The crew of the plane she took back to Chongqing after her visit to the United States were awarded the "Order of the Cloud and Banner" by our government for their meritorious service to China. The picture shows the scene of the award ceremony held at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. (At the far left) is Major General Mao Bangchu of the Chinese Air Force, who is shaking hands with and congratulating flight engineer Blossom. The crew of Madame Chiang's plane were all aviation officers of the Western Airlines, under the jurisdiction of the US Army Air Transport Command.

<h3>Gold and White Rice in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Report by Air from Our Guangzhou Correspondent</p>
<p>Victory has left people with beautiful dreams and endless hope. It seems that with the arrival of victory, the burdens of life can be put down, and even the old dreams of past peace and happiness can be relived. But half a year after victory, not only has this burden not been lifted, but it is generally going uphill.</p>
<p>Indeed, since Guangzhou's liberation, the prices of goods have risen day by day, especially in the last ten days, the fluctuations in gold and rice have been the highest in the country. According to the reporter's investigation, in mid-February, the price of gold per tael hovered between 130,000 and 140,000 yuan, and the price of white rice (medium grade) per dan only increased from 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. However, in these ten days, the degree of its surge is truly alarming. The highest price of gold per tael has broken through the 190,000 mark and risen to 200,000 yuan, an increase of 60%. What about white rice? The highest price has risen by 100% compared to mid-February, with only four taels available for every hundred yuan. The price of gold and white rice in late February is listed below:</p>
<p>From this, we can see the current standard of living in Guangzhou. But what is the reason for its soaring prices? Is it a food shortage panic? Or is it that unscrupulous merchants, seeing that a large amount of rice for Guangzhou will soon arrive, are trying to make a profit before it arrives? Yes; the former only accounts for a very small part, because the city's grain reserves are still enough for two months. However, the manipulation by the latter is the key to the problem.</p>
<p>Speculators, citing the tense situation in the Northeast, spread all kinds of news that would drive up the price of gold, and bought large quantities of gold, causing the price of gold to soar. Because the price of gold soared, it stimulated the prices of goods, and rice also skyrocketed, rising step by step, with each market higher than the last. When citizens saw the price of rice rising rapidly, they all panicked and bought it, so that the price of rice per dan rose by several thousand yuan in one day. A fearful mood filled the entire city of Guangzhou. The soaring price of gold stimulated food prices, and food affected people's livelihoods, resulting in starving people lying dead in the streets, reaching more than thirty a day, and phenomena such as workers going on strike. This phenomenon hides a social crisis. Although the authorities have discussed countermeasures to stabilize grain prices, investigate and deal with hoarders, and strictly manage grain merchants; and although there are tens of millions of dan of rice and flour for Guangzhou, people feel that distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Moreover, solving the people's livelihood is the key to social order and stability. If the people's livelihood cannot be solved, society will not be peaceful. Therefore, how to actively stabilize prices? How to effectively relieve the unemployed? These are the current important issues in Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Hengyang and Lingling Disaster Areas: Existing on the Brink of Starvation</h3>
<p>— A Report from Bingfan</p>
<p>Our Newspaper's Changsha Dispatch, Second Day</p>
<p>"Please kill me, cut open my stomach and see what's inside!" - a robber pleaded to County Magistrate Wang -</p>
<p>On February 24th, this reporter joined Director Yu of the Hunan Provincial Relief Branch on a trip to Hengyang and Yongzhou to survey the disaster. Three jeeps traveled through the northern countryside of Hengyang via the Yunheng Road, arriving in Hengyang that day. The next day, they passed through Qiyang, spending over three hours visiting before arriving in Lingling that evening.</p>
<p>Not a Soul in Sight, Encountering Only Three Cows</p>
<p>Along this hundreds-of-li stretch, the entire area was a disaster zone. There were few people to be seen in the villages. The suffering farmers had torn off the roofs of their houses, leaving only sections of broken walls. Farming tools were nowhere to be found. It was said that the fields hadn't been harvested in years. From a distance, there were only endless grassy slopes and desolation. Along this long stretch, we only encountered three cows. Old and young people, shivering and trembling, walked along the distant paths. They clasped their hands, held out their bowls, and headed towards the porridge kitchens. This reporter asked a child at the Third Porridge Kitchen in Hengyang:</p>
<p>"What does your family do?"</p>
<p>"Farm, alas!"</p>
<p>"And your father?"</p>
<p>"Resting at home."</p>
<p>"Do you have food to eat?"</p>
<p>The child shook his head, indicating that they hadn't had food in recent times.</p>
<p>Passive relief is not the solution. Director Yu did not strongly advocate "eating porridge." The focus should be on addressing the root causes: those who can work should work, and those who cannot should be sent home and helped to get there. The disaster victims did not want money; they wanted work. This reporter met a refugee from Hubei heading to the porridge kitchen. He was asked, "Why don't you go home?"</p>
<p>"What is there to eat at home? What is there to wear?" Indeed, this reporter had no answer. Going home would also mean waiting for relief. The important thing is to find work.</p>
<p>A Set of Clothing Lost Two Lives</p>
<p>The bandit scourge has passed, but the suffering remains with the people, and epidemics are about to break out. Now it is a drought, and the fields are cracked open. Since Hengyang's recapture, there have only been two rainfalls: one in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, and another the night before this reporter arrived in Hengyang, when there was a downpour. The common people in the streets and villages knelt on the ground, thanking Heaven that day. They banged on iron pots and other instruments to thank the Heavens for giving them food to eat.</p>
<p>Zhang Daxiang was a noted writer in western Hengyang several years ago. Now, even small writings are impossible. A family of a dozen had scattered to various places in search of food. The young children were left at home crying, collapsing into their grandmother's arms. Zhang Daxiang secretly sold his wife's pants and upper garment on the street to buy two measures of rice to comfort the children: "Don't cry, we'll have food to eat tonight." When his wife returned and learned of this, she argued with her husband. The children hugged their mother's legs, crying themselves hoarse. Afterwards, Zhang Daxiang returned to the room to find his mother hanging. He did not cry but stared blankly as he rushed out and jumped into a pond to his death.</p>
<p>Even Carrying a Bushel of Rice Means Being a Target for Robbery</p>
<p>Robberies and killings are common in the countryside of Hengyang. Someone who has gone to great lengths to carry a bushel or two of rice from afar is constantly at risk of being robbed in secluded areas. The county government has captured dozens of these rice robbers. One robber told County Magistrate Wang: "Please kill me, cut open my stomach and see what's inside!" We passed through Qiyang, originally not intending to stop but to go straight to Lingling. The people gathered at the station, a sea of humanity, tens of thousands of heads. They wanted relief. Director Yu got out of the car and distributed six tons of wheat flour, then visited the porridge kitchen. From the Dongjiang Bridge to the porridge kitchen, for more than a li, the refugees surged like a collapsing mountain, supporting the old and carrying the young, walking with bent backs. It was said that on the opening day of the porridge kitchen, there were only a few hundred people. The next day there were several thousand, and the third day more than ten thousand. Now there are over thirty thousand. Some looked like skeletons, others had scabies festering like bitter gourds, with a foul odor. Miss Conliff from America touched the upper garment of a refugee child and shook her head at Director Yu.</p>
<p>The villagers of Huangyun Township in Youyang sent a petition to the county government requesting "famine relief certificates" or "coffins." They could only seek survival or seek death.</p>
<p>In the newspaper, we found an announcement that read as follows:</p>
<p>Li Ermei's Announcement: The undersigned's original husband, Rong Ying, unfortunately died by gunfire after being seized as a forced laborer by the Japanese invaders last year. Their two sons are still young, and the grandmother is old and without food. The paternal grandfather, Tan Bole, hired her youngest son to continue the family line, but he provided no support to the children. Amidst this great drought, the undersigned, a woman, can hardly support the household. Driven by hunger, she has no choice but to sever ties with Tan Miao and marry Chen Quanzhi from this village as a concubine in order to support her children and provide her grandmother with 15,000 yuan, which is now urgently needed for sustenance. Besides asking relatives to make a statement, this announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Filling the Stomach with Fern Roots: No Bark or Roots Left</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Lingling, we went to Gongxin Township to assess the disaster. Gongxin Township has 24,000 people, of whom it is said that 20,000 have no food to eat. Villagers ran over from the rubble and knelt on the roadside begging us: "Heavenly Lord! Please save us!" Tears rolled down their cheeks. Director Yu, unable to hold back his own tears, offered sympathy and comfort. Miss Zhai Qiwen seemed deeply distressed. She reached out to help them up. They lived in thatched huts built on the burned-out fields, eating tree bark and grass roots: ground orchids, kudzu roots, olive bark, rush, goose buds, fern roots, as well as chaff and bran. The fern roots are one or two feet long, three or four fen in diameter, black, and dug from the mountains. Director Yu asked them what they were eating. An old woman pointed to a basket of fern roots in her hand and said, "We eat this!"</p>
<p>A Three-Year-Old Child is Worth Only 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>In the streets of Lingling, early in the morning, there was a strange trade. Bamboo baskets were placed on both sides of the street. Sitting in the baskets were children, some two years old, others three, four, or five years old. A bamboo ring was stuck on their bodies. The children were half aware and half unaware, playing with the bamboo rings. The adults stood by, looking at the passers-by with mournful faces. The buyers were all from out of town (such as guests from Guilin). If they saw a child who looked pretty, they might take one back with them. Some sold children after a few days, while others gave them away for free.</p>
<p>A local named Zhang Xinshan secretly sold one of his three-year-old children for 10,000 yuan, which he regarded as a good deal. After returning home, his wife drowned herself. The two children asked for their mother, and after that, nothing more was heard.</p>
<p>Remaining in Her Chamber, an Eighteen-Year-Old Became a Prostitute</p>
<p>There was also a tragic news item: Li Ermei, an eighteen-year-old girl, was waiting to be married and was living with her aunt. Her aunt's family was eating grass roots, so they sold her to become a prostitute. She had been sold for just three days when this reporter met her once and spoke with her. She always kept her head down. In the dim light, her hair hung in front of Li Ermei's chest.</p>
<p>This is not the end. The people on the Hengling Road continue to suffer and die like this. This reporter can only write this report with a sympathetic heart, hoping that all sectors will extend a helping hand and give this dispatch a practical conclusion. U.S. Army Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Luo Limou helped complete a new type of X-ray</p>
<h3>New Type of Battlefield X-ray Equipment</h3>
<p>U.S. Army Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Luo Limou helped complete a new type of X-ray machine. The machine is extremely lightweight and can be transported to the front lines by air. It can detect the location of bullets or shrapnel within the human body within forty seconds and record their depth, allowing surgeons to know where to begin. The total weight is 399 pounds, and it has its own generator. This machine has been used in many United Nations war zones.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang: Preventing Criminals from Disrupting the County. The County Government has received confidential reports that a few criminals are disguising themselves as vendors and engaging in sabotage in the urban area. To prevent this, the authorities ordered the relevant departments yesterday (the 14th) to pay close attention. Before the national identity cards are issued, all vendors in the urban area must register with the relevant township offices, obtain household registration certificates from the Baojia system, and have the township office stamp them to ensure caution. Starting this month, all vendors must carry this certificate with them for inspection at any time.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: River Tide Eroding Dike, Urgent Need for Repair. Hangzhou has been experiencing continuous rain. The dike has been eroded by the river tide, and the situation is very dangerous. About three miles outside the city from Qingtai Road, the field water and the shore have merged. Further ahead, the high ground has become low-lying. The sandy land in the Qibao area has mostly subsided, and the villagers have moved into the dike. Further into the river, the south bank vaguely reveals Zhe Mountain. The water and sky are the same color. The river tide is surging, and the yellow water has entered the dike. There are many gaps in the dike, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Continuing towards Jianggan, the sluice gate bridge is seen, with very rapid water flow. According to people from Xiaoshan, the river dikes along the shore were previously dug for trenches and have not yet been filled. At this time of water crisis, the villagers are extremely anxious and urgently hope that the water conservancy authorities will quickly find a way to repair and fill the gaps to avoid a major disaster.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Effectively Suppressing Price Hikes. The County Price Evaluation Committee convened a meeting on the 14th to suppress rampant price increases and decided to take effective measures. (1) Those who do not sell at the evaluated prices will be fined six hundred times the amount exceeding the evaluation. The fine will be kept in the county treasury and used to fund local projects. (2) All shops must clearly mark the prices of goods. Those who violate this will have all their goods confiscated, sold at auction, and the proceeds used for project funding.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Military Detention Center Inmates Escape. The military detention center, located in Guan Jian Lane in the city, is headed by Director Chen Yuanzu. Currently, it holds 76 inmates, all involved in cases of opium, robbery, military theft, banditry, and endangering the public. Many of the cases have not been adjudicated. At around 9 p.m. on the 14th, it was discovered that 17 prisoners, including convicts and those awaiting sentencing, had dug two holes in the wall of cell number one in compound A and escaped without a trace. The city gates were closed early, and a search was conducted everywhere. At around 1 a.m., two individuals, Lu Jiating and Zhao Chengde, were found at the train station. The remaining 15 fugitives, including Yu Shuyuan, are still being actively pursued.</p>
<p>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Inciting Strikes. Labor unrest has been frequent in this area recently. The number of labor disputes that were mediated last month totaled as many as 21. The First Pacification Zone Headquarters believed that labor unrest was closely related to social security, especially collective strikes, which were even more important. Yesterday, it issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting inciting strikes, and those who violate it will be prosecuted for endangering social security.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Criticism of Provincial Government Mismanagement at the Assembly. The Hubei Provincial Provisional Assembly recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Control Yuan, criticizing the Hubei Provincial Government for five points of mismanagement: (1) Taking the lead in concealing the Central Government's intentions, suppressing the order to suspend the collection of arrears in taxes and instead strictly limiting the collection at the same time. (2) Condemning subordinates’ corruption. County magistrate Chen Wen of Chengfeng County, County magistrate Wang Bin of Shishou County, County magistrate Li Chengzhong of Daye County, the manager of the supply office, Tai Yuncheng, etc. who were investigated and found to be corrupt, were allowed to escape because the provincial government delayed prosecution. Ye Jingxiong, a confidant of the provincial chairman Wang Dongyuan, also only had an arrest warrant issued for privately selling tens of thousands of yuan of received materials. (3) Indiscriminate withdrawal of transferred funds and also sending Director Wu of the Department of Finance to attempt bribery at the assembly. (4) Appointing private individuals, even those with notorious track records and pending arrest, to important positions. (5) Blocking news and suppressing public opinion.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Needs a "Children's Theater"</h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>Theater is not just a simple form of entertainment; it contains a profound educational significance. Because theater is education through art, it can directly influence the audience. Many people have mentioned these theories before.</p>
<p>What we are now bringing up is the relationship between theater and children's education. Theater not only educates adults, but its impact on children may be even more profound.</p>
<p>In our country's past, there was the famous story of Mencius' mother moving three times. The actions of the neighbors could invisibly influence the sage Mencius. It seems unquestionable that theater, through the artistic form of performance, can guide ordinary children. Children love to learn and imitate, and the education they receive in their youth has a significant impact on their future. Therefore, if theatrical art can be used as a tool to educate children, the effect will definitely be great.</p>
<p>Talking about using theater to promote education for children, the first thing to study is naturally the issue of advocating children's theater, and even more practically, the need for a "children's theater." With a children's theater, children have a place to be educated, and then the required children's theater will emerge and be created.</p>
<p>The "Children's Theater" is said to have originated in the first anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution in 1918. Because the Soviet Union pays the most attention to propaganda, they once declared: Using "Children's Theater is the most effective tool for educating children to become future soldiers." Children's theaters are also very common in the United States. Someone in Hong Kong once launched this movement, and the results were quite good. Now, speaking of Shanghai, which is known as an international metropolis, although there are many theaters for adults to enjoy, no one seems to have mentioned "children's theaters." Therefore, this writer wants to make a suggestion, hoping that accomplished people in social education and theater movement will jointly launch this "children's theater" movement. We believe that this is not only fortunate for the children of Shanghai, but also very beneficial to the entire country and society.</p>
<p>Theater Review</p>
<h3>The Theater Chronicle (Performed by Guanghua)</h3>
<p>— Shao Zijie</p>
<p>We should thank the theater workers for pioneering and planting seeds for the theater movement. The road of the theater movement is tortuous and difficult. However, the young workers work hard, tirelessly, enthusiastically, and foolishly for the theater, nurturing poignant sadness. What is shown in "The Theater Chronicle" includes the success of theater movement workers, as well as the failure of theater movement workers, the glory of theater movement workers, and also the disgrace of theater movement workers, and... This is not only a milestone in the theater world. What is presented in the whole play should also be the vicissitudes of the theater movement workers. Yun Ni's death, Ruo Yan's fall, Lu Xiankui's anxiety and depression about the economy of the theater troupe, Tang Qianqian's corruption, and Meng Hui Jiang Han, etc. working calmly for the theater, the workers of the theater movement illuminated the road of the theater, their bodies laid the cornerstone of success. Without stepping over the bodies of these people, the Chinese New Drama Movement will not reach its destination.</p>
<p>The playwright not only portrayed the blood and tears of the theater movement workers, but also illuminated the obsolescence of the times. Mr. Feng Zhi's preventing his daughter from acting, the police station's ban on men and women performing together, and the actors being stopped by the military police for shouting "The Northeast is ours," without theater, the transformation of the times would not be so fast. This further proves that the blood and sweat of the workers in the theater has not been in vain.</p>
<p>There are enough characters in the whole play, but the playwright handles them so harmoniously, orderly, and unified. In the collective creation, there is no flaw in the tradition. The director rehearsed the whole play very well. Ding Cong's device and Shen Yan's lighting made the stage design so soft and lovely. On the whole, the actors can cooperate appropriately. Lan Ma's Lu Xiankui does have extraordinary success. Zhai Yu's Meng Hui, and Dai Yun's Ren Juequn are also very good. Wan Su's Yun Ni acted subtle enough when she played a female student in the first half of the play, but she was not enough when she played a movie star in the second half of the play.</p>
<h3>Tan Muqian's Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>The reason why I like "Spoken Drama" is not because people say it, it is novel, it is more advanced than "Beijing Opera" and "of Du Opera". I think the former has flesh and blood, and can reflect the reality of evil and the compactness and concreteness of party feelings, unlike Beijing Opera, which is so abstract, not like "of Du Opera", the thousand-story uniformity of the reason. Although the current stage of "Spoken Drama" also has many unsatisfactory places, these are not enough to hinder its progress, its growth and development. In order to hope that Spoken Drama has a better future in China, the author wants to say a few words here about the bad habits in the current Spoken Drama world.</p>
<p>Spoken drama seems to have such a phenomenon at present: 1. As long as it can sell seats, it is thought that the script is very good. 2. As long as there is a performance, it is thought that you are great, and it is thought that you have reached the task and mission of spoken drama. At first glance, the reason seems to be very right. Being able to sell seats and having performances are naturally the main conditions for developing drama,</p>
<p>What is worth our attention and vigilance is that the plays that can sell seats often cater to the psychology of people with low tastes, so they are not necessarily good plays; the theater troupes that have performances often do not care about the quality of the script and the needs of reality, so they are not necessarily good theater troupes. The key to the problem is whether the content of the script is progressive and whether the performance of the theater troupe is faithful. In other words, if you forget the lofty goal of the New Drama Movement—anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and promoting democratization and scientification—no matter how well this script can sell seats, and how the theater troupe continues to cultivate and work hard for the New Drama Movement, such a script and such a theater troupe are still not what China needs in the future.</p>
<p>Sound criticism and accepting criticism are also very important for the New Drama Movement. Because criticism of a play can on the one hand enable readers and audiences to understand the theme and characteristics of the work step by step, how to accept the thoughts entrusted by the playwright, and on the other hand enable playwrights to grasp the highest准则 of drama writing at this stage, so that actors, directors, and those responsible for lighting, special effects, etc., pay attention to future work. It is a pity that this principle is still rarely done in various places today. In recent years, this problem has occurred in the rear, and there have been many unfortunate tragedies. Some newspaper offices have been beaten to pieces for publishing articles criticizing drama, and some authors who wrote drama criticism have been beaten until their skin was broken and bleeding. In this way, those who can write dare not write, but those who cannot write get up to write nonsense and blow their own horns. It is hoped that this phenomenon can no longer exist in the drama world in the future.</p>
<p>Introduction to Theater People</p>
<h3>Shen Fu</h3>
<p>— Lu Zi</p>
<p>If it were not for forgetful audiences, they would surely remember the two films that were once a sensation — "Free Land" (starring Chen Yanyan and Ouyang Hongying) and "A Match Made in Heaven" (starring Bai Lu and Han Langen). Due to these two films, they would also think of the big director Shen Fu. Fatty Shen was not only a popular director of Lianhua Film Company before the war, but also completed three masterpieces in the extremely difficult working environment in the rear in recent years—"Small People's Rhapsody," "Full House of Gold and Jade," and "Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing." These three scripts have been performed in various places in the rear, and their box office success can be said to have broken records. Both insiders and outsiders unanimously praised them as masterpieces. Among the three plays, "Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing" is even more wonderful. The content depicts the statues of people from all walks of life in Chongqing within twenty-four hours, and it has been performed twice in Chengdu.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Shen Fu and Bai Yang formed the Film People's Troupe and entered Sichuan, rehearsing many spoken dramas, such as Thunderstorm Sunrise Wilderness, etc. In "Sunrise," Shen also played Manager Pan as an actor. Later, Wen Songkang and Qin Wei re-established the Northwest Film Studio in Xi'an and sent people thousands of miles to invite Shen Fu and He Mengfu to participate in the cooperation. Mengfu then shot his new work "Wind and Snow Taihang Mountain" (starring Ouyang Hongying and Xie Tian) on the spot. Shen Fu went to the northwest to shoot his self-written and directed "Long Live the People," but due to major problems with transportation and materials (the source of film was cut off after the outbreak of the Pacific War), he had to shelve it midway. This play took a lot of his effort, and he said to himself, "It is a lifelong regret that I cannot complete it." He also rehearsed many spoken dramas in the "Western Electric" Troupe.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Central Film Studio specially hired him as a screenwriter and director. His three masterpieces were completed after entering Zhongdian. He is a top red director in Chongqing. Shen Fu's ability to achieve today's position is not an accidental opportunity. First, he has good cultivation and treats people sincerely. None of the friends who have worked with him do not respect him. If there is a personnel dispute in the theater troupe, as long as Shen Fu comes out to mediate, there will be no problem at all. He is now forty years old. His wife is from Suzhou, beautiful, virtuous, and gentle, but unfortunately her health is not very good and she often has minor illnesses. But unexpectedly, Shen, a big man, is meticulous and very considerate of her. Recently, after Shen Fu rushed to finish Xie Tian's "Night Tide on the Bund", followed by Yang Hansheng's "Heroes of the Grassland", he will probably fly to Beiping in the middle of next month to shoot his new film script "Hero Mother" and "Emei Spring Dawn". Audiences in Pinghu, who have been away for a long time, please wait patiently for the good film!</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion on "Model Teacher for All Times"</h3>
<p>— Wucun</p>
<p>Drama movement, in recent years, taking wartime capital Chongqing and the enemy-occupied Shanghai as its bases, has exhibited a vigorous scene. Although the environments of the two are completely different, the playwrights, tempered by the cruel reality, are consistent in their efforts to approach truth. This tendency is especially obvious among the playwrights in the rear. They not only understand hate but also understand love; not only whip and accuse but also turn to encourage and praise. We have seen Mr. Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," an upward and positive drama that we have worked hard to perform. Now we have read Mr. Yuan Jun's "Model Teacher for All Times."</p>
<p>After eight years of bitter fighting, lives were devastated. In the midst of widespread warfare, we have seen many admirable and moving deeds and people. The arduous and outstanding spirit and the awe-inspiring integrity of some educators are just one example. Mr. Yuan Jun set aside various questionable and contemptible phenomena in the War of Resistance and used the keen observation and warm sympathy of an artist to complete a sacred statue for us. Professor Lin Tong of the university, as portrayed by Mr. Yuan, has light and heat, but at the same time, he is a flesh-and-blood character who has been through ups and downs. In this regard, he is more familiar and approachable to us than Ding Huofu and Commissioner Liang in "Metamorphosis."</p>
<p>Around Professor Lin Tong, Mr. Yuan Jun also wrote about some of the dregs of the times, those professors who could not bear poverty and snobbery and changed their careers to business. This is not only for setting off but also for unearthing the truth. "Model Teacher for All Times" is realistic but full of lofty ideals. The author moves us with a full and vivid brush and encourages us with unrestrained enthusiasm, elevating and uplifting our spirit.</p>
<p>Now "Model Teacher for All Times" has been performed by the Central Drama Troupe at the Lyceum Theatre. It is in Chongqing, and I believe "Model Teacher for All Times" will be even more appreciated by the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Review and Introduction of Drama</p>
<h3>Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River (Yu Ling)</h3>
<p>— Zijie</p>
<p>"Our people, both military and civilian, must deeply realize the suffering of our compatriots in the occupied areas to what extent they have reached... Our compatriots should think about these compatriots who cannot seek death and have no way to serve the country, and they will know how urgently they need our rescue..." —Excerpt from Chairman Chiang's Announcement to the Military and Civilians on the Seventh Anniversary of the War of Resistance—</p>
<p>Six years ago, I finished reading Mr. Yu Ling's "Night Shanghai" in tears. Today, I am fortunate to read Mr. Yu Ling's recent work, "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River." These two plays should be related. The characters presented in the latter are also the protagonists of the former. If "Night Shanghai" depicts the suffering in the early stage of the War of Resistance, then the latter portrays the misery in the semi-occupied areas. I did love the reality in "Night Shanghai," but now I must say that I love the situation in "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" even more. Regardless of what "Night Shanghai" indicates to us, "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" should be a good play that targets reality.</p>
<p>The story unfolds in the semi-occupied Tonglin area south of the Yangtze River. In order to realize its goal of controlling Tung oil, the enemy spared no effort to use the two traitors, Lu Tong and Mei Yu, to try to buy the Mei family's Tong Garden. However, Mei Lingchun, the owner of this Tong Garden, a loyal country gentleman who had just fled back to his hometown from Shanghai, firmly refused. On the evening of the autumn tung oil harvest, the Tong Garden was suddenly burned to ashes under the enemy's flames, but the guerrillas had already rescued all the tung oil the day before. Mei Lingchun, looking at his home that had been robbed again, finally let his daughter, Menghui, officially join the political work team in anger. On the day when the tung oil was fully loaded on the boat for the guerrillas to be transported back to the rear, he also encouraged his son, Meizhu, to join the air force in the rear. Mei Lingchun's contribution to the victory of the War of Resistance cannot be erased, and the whole play shows more of the bright side. Sincerely, what "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" tells us is mostly encouraging. In the promotion of the War of Resistance and national construction, the effect of "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" should be quite significant.</p>
<p>Savoring the events in the play from familiar shadows, painful bloodstains reappeared in ancient memories. Thanks to Mr. Zi Ling for writing these into a play. From this, I believe that people can gain a deeper understanding of the suffering of the occupied areas. As the play says: "The compatriots in the occupied areas are enduring like this, guarding like this, and looking forward to the counter-offensive like this, urgently waiting for rescue. Let the rear everything be for the counter-offensive, rescue the people in the occupied areas, and recover the occupied land. Remember... remember my words, don't forget everything is for the counter-offensive, rescue the occupied areas..." This should be the cry of the dying, but Mr. Yu Ling shouted it out for the people in the occupied areas. Fortunately, the War of Resistance has been won. Now the problem facing us is national construction. I think we should no longer discriminate. True people have patriotic hearts.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Song Yun Collection</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Yifu</p>
<p>In recent times, scholars who study and admire opera have different preferences. However, few practice Kunqu Opera. Moreover, at a time when the country has not yet been restored, one cannot avoid the feeling of derelict fields. I have been living in the countryside for three years, lying drunk in my hometown, and I no longer play this tune. After my illness, I abandoned it even more. Since the victory came, the stench of war was swept away, and I was ordered to guard Shanghai. I came to the sea again and stayed at the Song Yun Villa. The host and hostess are deeply fond of Kunqu Opera. They often ascend the high building of Bai Xue, invite old friends of Qingxi, gather to perform songs, and meet two or three times a month. This spring (24th), they held a grand event again, and the Kunqu Opera friends who came to Shanghai from the new rear were all happy to attend. After several years of separation, we reunited in one hall; the flute playing in the song, the wind and flowers flying everywhere. We exhausted the fun of the day and night, and finally got twenty-four dramas. The host can be said to be as hospitable as Kong Beihai and as fond of music as Wei Liangfu.</p>
<p>On that day, the gong was struck, and the garden tour was sung in order. Tavern. Thinking of the mortal world. Sugar cane forest. Chat. Qin Tiao, and Chen Miaochang, sung by Yan Gong, an old man of seventy-three, was full of charm. The clear sound was emitted, delicate, rounded, and appropriate. Yan has recently taken on courses at the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School, which is rare. Next was A Fool's Dream, Picking Paintings, Taking In, and A Good Time. Zhang Genglin's Cui Shi was quite difficult to sing in the high pitches. Wang Xunzhi's Liu Mengmei was also clear and elegant. Then there was Listening to the Bell, Sending Yu, Looking Home, and Unloading the Seal. Zhu Xihua's Tang Minghuang showed sparseness in both singing and recitation. Moreover, the final Wuling Flower was bright but not high-pitched, surpassing others. Zhu Xizhen and Gong Lingzun's Sending Son, with Xu Boyou's flute, suddenly became an excited sound, like a sad spring rushing into a valley. The listeners held their breath, and the steady dialogue was just the remainder. Sheng Cheng, who played Su Wu in Looking Home, used a woman's voice to express the old age, and also vividly showed the lonely minister outside the border, looking forward to the palace with earnest heart, which was also commendable. The guests on the seats, such as Yao Jilang, Chen Naiwen, Wang Shuguang, Cai Shuliu, and Li Xitong, were all focused. At this point, the torch had been lit. Zhao Jingshen's pre-booked Pan Fu was postponed again due to his absence. Therefore, Gongci brought forward the Neiting Benqi Double Meeting to suppress the carriage. Zhu Yaowen's Jingzi was very fluent. I sang Li Qi, which was not my profession, especially with the water, gold, and Zhishuang flutes going together, I felt very weak. Writing the Complaint was performed by Shen Yiyi as Zhao Chong, and the host's wife, Mrs. Kong, played Guizhi. Shen was one of the few female actors who played male roles, and Mrs. Kong used the delicate and charming voice of a boudoir girl, making the listeners hold their breath. When the song ended, the people were quiet, almost making the orchid not fragrant and the jade platform lose its color. Three times we added Zhao Jingshen's Bao Tong, the taste was endless. After the banquet, a small banquet of Pan Fu was held, reopening the scene and satisfying the interest in the song. Xia Huanxin's ballad served as the finale. It was almost midnight when it dispersed. When the wine was exhausted and the song was tired, I wrote a few words and returned them to the host, to mark my presence.</p>

<h3>Notes on Affixing Stamps</h3>
<p>It has been five months since the implementation of direct taxes in this city. However, many merchants and companies often neglect or do not understand the affixing of stamps on capital accounts, resulting in fines of more than 20 times or less than 60 times the tax payable. According to item 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, the deed of joint venture business is calculated according to the stamp duty ratio of 40 cents per hundred yuan. The remarks column states: "The contract or articles of association mutually concluded in this item. Minutes. Stock. The ledger of ten thousand taels, etc., if another stock or share certificate is issued, the ledger of ten thousand taels should be affixed according to item 15 of this table, the book used by the business, that is, four yuan per year. If two or more copies are concluded separately, stamps should be affixed according to the amount of capital contributed, that is, four per thousand. If it is a sole proprietorship, stamps should also be affixed on the account book according to the capital amount of four per thousand. Each share of stock is affixed with a stamp duty of 40 cents per hundred yuan of the face value, which is also calculated proportionally. After the stamp is affixed, it does not need to be affixed again every year. It is hoped that merchants and companies with such circumstances who have not affixed stamps will make up the stamps to avoid repeating the same mistakes and being punished. It will be too late to regret it. Net governance.</p>
