<h3>各路國軍正迅速挺進　大同之圍卽可解除　城郊數處據點業經收復</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕大同守軍，今晨電告此間關係長官，城北之車站酒精廠麵粉公司等據點，一度失陷後，巳予奪回，且收復開戰之初所失數小據點，共軍雖攻擊仍烈，且不斷以大砲向城內射擊，但其圍城兵力，似漸减少，或因集寗　鎭兩地吃緊，而移調往援。傅作義部如進展迅速，大同可能轉危爲安。圍攻大同南方應縣之共軍，因久攻不下，已決渾河堤岸，應縣縣城東門水位及肩，全城有被淹之處。另息，國軍某部，正渡黃河北上。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏七日電〕大同守軍欣聞西援友軍佔領卓資山，今日特開門出擊，共軍包圍圈漸呈鬆懈，此間各方預料，大同可望於中秋節解圍。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕大同攻守戰，仍甚激烈，國軍陸續增援，漸轉穩定。新華社懷仁七日電稱，大同城內有難民逃出，顯已承認大同並未攻克。又該社張家口電，承認冀東方而共軍，連戰皆受挫，香河於五日三河於四日先後爲國軍攻克。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏七日電〕前盤據卓資山之共軍爲賀龍基幹部隊三五八旅，國軍進駐後，僅西北高地即發現屍體四百具，現共軍向東南方向潰退，我方騎兵已迫近集寗城郊。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏七日電〕共軍於五日夜至六日晨曾反撲卓資山，遺屍二百具後潰退。當有團政委盧政歧，營長李大明等反正。共方在卓資山設有僞龍勝縣，國軍入城後，豁免共軍所設一切祈捐雜稅，並佈吿自耕農，勿向貧民再行算帳，而以法律解決。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏七日電〕綏省東進公務員二百人定七日由歸綏出發，目的地爲集寗。豐鎭。興和。凉城四縣。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏八日電〕國軍收復卓資山後，大同共軍已　動搖之勢，連日積極向集寗增援，似有西犯企圖。卓資山之役，共軍所築工事，大半均用鐵軌搭築而成，並有洋灰鋼筋工事，益形堅固，惟國軍在民衆協助作戰之下，卒獲勝利。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京八日電〕延安電合，今日承認國軍所獲之若干勝利。</p>
<p>進攻大同共軍配備形勢</p>
<p>〔中央社太原七日電〕大同方面，自城北車站與城南　場先後為共軍控制後，戰事迫及城關，攻城共軍，已增至六萬以上，不惜以重大代價，企圖奪取大同，此間長官部估計，共軍進攻大同之形勢如下：共軍總指揮已易爲蕭克，駐城東五十里之聚樂堡，下設四地區指揮部，姚結爲城東指揮，駐距城十里馬坡山，轄三十二旅，野戰十，十一，十二旅，三五九旅，游擊一支隊，陽高支隊，第一綫部隊約一萬七千五百人聚樂堡三十里堡地區，駐野戰一旅第一師，約五千人，陽高附近駐一零九旅，約一千五百人，（全係日人）楊成武爲城南指揮，駐距城二十里之大子村，轄野戰十三旅，的五千八百人，晋冀共軍區二旅，（番號不明）王赤軍爲城西指揮，駐距城十里小站村，轄五軍分區五千人，獨二三兩團，及十八師約萬餘人，城北指揮爲張新武，（前電誤爲黃新武）駐距城二十里孤店，轄野戰二旅，十四旅警衛團，蒙古大隊等一萬五千餘人，綜計共軍兵力約六萬餘人。</p>

<p>〔本報北平八日電〕保定電話，冀全省展開淸鄉工作後，保定地區發展亦頗順利，向南推進之國軍部隊及地方團隊，昨上午已渡過金綫河，共軍已調望都等地共軍來援，現仍激戰中。保定北方由固城向東推進之部隊，昨下午一時收復容城，繼續掃蕩中。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽七日電〕冀東共軍全部的兩三萬人，因國軍已沿北寗路設防，故共軍將無破壞鐵路之能力。</p>

<p>〔中央社徐州八日電〕據息，共軍於七月十八日進犯如皋，該縣王縣長運典，因率屬協助國軍作戰，不幸被俘，酷刑鞫訊，極盡凌辱，王縣長忠貞不屈，厲聲斥共黨爲害民賊，並高呼蔣主席萬歲，詞極壯烈慷慨，旋被槍殺，其他被俘之該縣第三區長彭紀申，泰興縣警局科長李德昌，及如皋保安隊士兵還鄉團等十四名，亦遭殺書。</p>

<h3>共軍施用毒氣　幷市各報一致抨擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原八日電〕幷市各報對攻大同共軍，兩度施放毒氣，攻佔車站罪行，一致予以抨擊。民衆日報以我們的控訴爲題，指責共軍這種絕滅道德，違反人道，反噬同胞的萬惡行爲，實較德日法西斯猶爲殘忍兇暴，要求政府應該當機立斷，迅予制裁，不只除惡務盡，更要除惡務速。</p>

<h3>政府決將日人工業　悉數移私人經營　中紡各廠兩年內逐漸移歸民營</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京七日電〕國府爲克服產品出口之停滯起見，已令中央信託局收買全國所產蠶絲，更在放慮對其他主要出品如桐油，茶葉，豬鬃，採取同樣行動。</p>
<p>王雲五對外記者談</p>
<p>經濟部長王雲五接見聯事社　記者稱：此舉等於津貼重要出品，因政府售諸國個，較收買價為低。現　絲出產，稍逾一千抇，僅及嚴前產額之一小部份。生活高昂運輸困難及工資騰貴，乃中國經濟復興之三種主要障碍，江浙兩省絲商亦因此猶豫不決，未敢發展其事業。政府於此不得不採取行動，收買茶葉，亦將虧折，桐油較佳，僅豬鬃可相抵。政府爲繼續努力穩定經濟起見，擬在九月三十日以前，將日人工業悉數移歸私人經營，僅重工業除外，以其範圍廣大，需要政府管理，如紡織業是。中紡公司各紗廠將於兩年內逐一移歸私營或出售股票，其餘日人之工業將移歸私營者，僅上海區已値五億美元。戰時內遷遭受損失之工業家可獲優先權。此等工業，如經兩决標售，仍未售出，則另有三種取得辦法：（一）立即付款，七折計算；（二）分期付款無折扣；（三）借營兩年，利息照估價百分之付計算，並規定承組人須於租期屆滿時承購之。上海方面工廠照第一種辦法辦理者四十所，照第二種辦理者一百所。政府又盼望於月內將日人强佔之工廠，大部份交還原主，日人在强佔工廠之改善設備，將照不計利息，兩年償還之計劃售予原主。中紡公司有錠子一百七十萬枚，迄今三分之二已開工，年內盼望全部開工。經濟部並對勞工之增加，採取「堅決立塲」，除非擴大雇工人數，於一般勞工有裨助，吾則經濟部反對勞工再予增加。政府爲防止米價「飛漲」起見，現正攷慮貯存一年之糧，現因糧食豐收，米價趨跌。至於改革土地，政府遲早須加鄭重攷慮，惟目今不致採取激烈步驟云。</p>

<h3>行總工作明秋結束　檢討會昨日圓滿閉幕　李卓敏報告出席聯總大會經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕為期四日之行總工作檢討會，巳於八日下午五時正式閉幕，結果極圓滿。今日開會最受人注意者，為該署李副署長卓敵之報吿。李氏甫由日內瓦參加聯總第五次大會歸來，對該案經過報告極詳。李氏於演詞中宣布：至明年三月底止，聯總所將撥給我國之預算決不致少過五萬六千二百五十萬美金，外加海上運費及外籍　術人員維持費，總數當在七億美金以上，此事會得聯總署長賴伽第亞之保證。至聯總物資援華，截止期限，聯總中央委會三個月前即認為明年三月底即告結束，未免過於侷促。此次大會又決議關於中國部份物資之購買及運銷，其期限得展至三月底以後，即該時以後，聯總仍可以物資供給中國。另一問題爲聯總在華工作結束期限，關於此事，賴伽第亞曾告李氏，目前定貨恐至明年八九月始能運到，因之終止日期未決定。李氏相信其時期當在明年秋季。至外籍拔術人員工作截止期。我國主張亦　至明年三月底以後，美國已予同意。</p>
<p>繼由蔣署長廷黻致詞，謂：根據聯總大會之各種決定，行總工作之結束期當在明秋八九月，對工作期間，余（蔣自稱）本人不希望過份延長，蓋行總爲一臨時機構，衛生事業應由衛生署辦理，農業應由農林部負責，政府接管此類業務愈早愈好，延長並非好事。蔣氏又謂：五萬六千二百萬美金之物資，等於抗戰前我當年進口貨之三倍，我人責任非輕，應在運輸及分配上多加努力。詞畢，各小組報吿七日午後審査提案意見，第四决大會至十二時許始散。</p>
<p>檢討會閉幕禮於下午三時半舉行，劉鴻生致訓詞，繼由蔣署長致閉幕詞，略謂：我人現僅完成工作三分之一，尚有三分之二工作　待努力，盼能在明年今日以前加速將物資運畢，惟請各分署長注意物資勿爲人呑沒。末對各分署同人辛勤工作，慰勉有加，認此工作對得起國家與友邦。詞畢，由湖南分署長余籍傳代表致答，繼通過向將主席致敬電，大會旋於熱烈掌聲巾閉幕。</p>
<p>據蔣　長於　後舟罷者，渠定今晚返滬。行　與陳納　之　運合約，　政　批准後即簽字。又聞李副　長定明日返滬，其他各分署　長亦將於日內陸　　返　地。至行總與糧部交換糧食事，若十署長已將交換地點之價格　齊後即可與糧部洽商。</p>

<h3>祝市參議會首次大會開幕　並紀念九九勝利日</h3>
<p>一年前的今日，日軍駐華最高指揮官岡村密次，正式向我國最高統帥投降，迄今已整整一年了。這是我國歷史上最光榮的一個勝利紀念日，値得我們熱烈慶祝；惟回憶一年以來的建國工作因爲有共產黨問題從中作梗，迄未能順利展開，更無重大成就，實使吾人愧對抗戰先烈！今日欣逢此一光榮的勝利紀念日，我們應從今天起，再下絕大的決心，以汗與血來建設新中國，以保金這一個輝煌絢爛的勝利之果。至於今後努力的方向，首在促進政治的民主化。上海市參議會特定於今日舉行第一次大會，實有深長的意義；凡我上海市民均應十分重視。參議會係民意機關，所有參議員均爲市民投票選舉而產生常須代表全市三百五十萬市民而發言，觀於各參議員所提出的議案，已達三百十餘件之多，可知各參議員對於各項市政問題，均將充分發揮民意。是以上海市參議會今日開幕，實爲上海市政民主化的開端。</p>
<p>上海為我國第一個通商大埠，也是全國文化的中心，人口的眾多，工商的繁盛，市政的亟待改革，均在其他省市之上；而且又爲中外觀瞻所繫。戰後的世界，旣已步入和平民主的新時代，中國政治的民生化，匪特爲全國上下一致的要求，抑且爲友邦人士所期望者。但是民主政治的演進，有其一定的軋跡，且須聽其自然發展，在其開始萌芽之際，允須注意民主作風的培養與倡導。以本市而論，政府在上海光復之後，即積極籌備市參議會的成立；惟以技術上的困難，舉行民選，非一蹴可成；乃先行設立臨時參議會，俾使民意得有上達的機會，市政當局爲集思廣益計，亦可儘量採納這許多社會賢達所提供的意見。惟這種過渡辦法，當屬權宜之計，故不久即正式舉行民選，各界知名之士，均踴躍參加競選，其間雖亦有難令人滿意之事發生，但仍不失為民主國家競選時風氣，未當不是可喜的現象。我們既要政治民主化，就得儘　學習，以養成民主政治的作風；空口高呼民主，民主決不能自天而降。所以我們對於今日開幕的市參議會，抱着下列兩項期望：</p>
<p>第一，實行政治民主化最重要的條件，厥爲養成人民有民主的作風與態度，我國一部政治史，雖然很早就有民主的思想，但是歷代政治家重禮治，而不重法治，因此對於民主政治，毫夫憑藉；今日吾人欲談民主，則必先養成國人的民主風度，從而創造民主的傳統精神。這種風氣的傳播，有待參議員的倡導。所以我們希望所有參議員，均能以身作則，秉有民主的風度，在討論各項問題與他人發生辯論時，尤須注意自己的態度。再在發言時亦須考慮到，是否能代表市民的意見？所謂民主政治者，一切以民意爲依歸，自下而上，絕不容有所假借的。</p>
<p>第二，各參議員均來自社會各階層，深知民生疾苦；旣爲人民代表，當須儘量代表人民發言；同時在競選時又曾向選民提供種種諾言，更希望其能兌現，因此各參議員所提出之提案，不免龐雜；而在市參議會本身，爲時間及技術所限，如欲將所有提案，一律提出討論，聽任各議員自由發表意見，勢不可能。所以我們主張各參議員提案，應有輕重緩急之分，尤須注意其可行性。輿論界知其重點所在，亦可從旁協助，促其實現。反之，如無重點，則意見紛歧，議論龐雜，力量就要分散，任何提案均難獲致協議，即爲大會所通過，亦難望其貫澈。</p>
<p>要之，市參議會是民意機關，負有監督政府的任務；而上海市政有待革新，市參議會能否發揮其功效。實爲上海市政民主化的一大考驗。</p>

<h3>體育節談體育</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>今天是「九九」，國家規定爲體育節，我們且先來談談體育的意義與功能。</p>
<p>我們不安單望找前程，先要問問自己可有一個健康的身體？我們不要儘鼓勵生活舒適，先要問問自己可有衛生的習慣？我們不要只想做一等強國，先要問問自己可有一等的體格？</p>
<p>造成國家生命的三要素：曰環境，曰文化，曰遺傳，而以遺傳爲首要。國家的生命力爲武力，經濟，敎育，而以敎育作總　紐。敎育有三方面，即德育，智育，體育，而以體育樹其基。</p>
<p>體育這名詞，是從英文Physical　Education中譯來，意即身體的敎育。當今一元的整個的敎育時代，有人懷疑這名詞，而欲以「運動」替代「體育」。惟運動兩字未嘗普遍採用前，仍以體育名之。體育本身實在不是一種目的，只是一種方法，一種工其。它的意義，是以身體大肌肉活動爲工具而謀達到敎育目的的一種敎育。這裏「活動」兩字，乃指一切機體的活動，如學習中的思想情感，以及一切對於環境的學習反應而言。</p>
<p>體育的目的應與近代教育哲學，教育目的和教育目標相吻合。目的是指廣闊的一般的趨向於最高標準，比目標高，但不一定即達到。目標是目的中分析出來，指示特殊要點，易於達到而且爲達到目的的必經階段。體育目的是在於供給精明能幹的領袖，優良合理的環境，和適宜運動的機會，使個人或團體在此情形之下，能獲得健康的身體，快活的精神，和健全的社性人格。體育目標該爲（一）發達個人機體組織，（二）發達神經肌肉組織的技能，（三）發達良好運動態度，（四）發達道德行爲標準。</p>
<p>我國自淸季同治初年新敎育興辦以還，體育一向誤爲競技運動，過重於訓練奪取錦標和打破紀錄，只養成了少數選手，角逐時往往打架吵嘴；而號稱爲運動家的，長壽的少，短命的多。誤以競技爲體育的專家們，最好有機會去看看「蘇聯之光」這張影片，纔可知道人家是怎樣實施體育的。有些學校上體育課，師生多穿長衣，一二一二的喊着，汗都不流一滴；如此，更失却了體育本來目的。就講選手吧，與西洋的一比，又成了飯囊酒袋。記得民廿五年，我國一三九個選手參加柏林世界運動會，全軍覆沒！籃球比賽時，我方得罰球二十四次的機會，一次都未投中，這說出不獨技術不如人，身體素質更不如人。像這樣的情形，如何能够機械化我們的國防？現代化我們的國家？</p>
<p>我國古代的六藝敎育，即是三育敎育。鄭玄謂：「師，諸侯師氏，有德行以敎民者；儒，諸侯保氏，有六藝以敎民者。」較西洋早得多。古希臘敎育甫身體（Boby）和心智（Mind），到中世紀宗敎敎育思潮勃興時，德育（Soul）才露頭角，才完成三育敎育，較諸吾國的六藝敎育遲得多。六藝之敎的射御，便是提倡體育的實施方法，從個人體格訓練起，進而至於養成國防的基本技能；在個人是「文武全才」，在國家是「有文事者必有武備」，寓衛國於衛生之中。</p>
<p>吾國音樂敎有中的舞勺舞象，授以節奏和諧的運動訓練，足見古人無往而不重視體育。英國的國技足球，在我國老早發明，古稱蹴踘，迨後這種游戲進而至用馬代步，變成今日的馬球。在唐詩宋畫中，斑斑可放。吾國體育極重道德，論語八佾第三，載孔子所說，「君子無所爭，必也射乎？揖讓而升，下而飲，其爭也君子。」又如蘇東坡所謂，「勝固欣然，敗亦可喜。」西洋人的「運動家精神」（Sportsmanshik），即是我們的君子精神，在運動中訓練守紀律，講道德，已處處流露了。遝動而不講德性，很易流爲好勇鬥狠；此可以產生兩個相反的極端，一爲演成好亂，一則因噎廢食，輕視體育。民族國家，吃虧不少！</p>
<p>重文輕武的流弊，是文武分途。文武旣分，不但知難，行亦困難。唐末開始科舉，文武從此分家，到了宋代，更不堪設想，民族健康由此走下坡路，文化亦隨之走下坡路。美國心理學家霍爾（Stanley　Hall）謂，「一個文化的黃金時代，其三十年前必有一個身體的黃金時代。」我們看，唐朝高祖太宗的雄健，楊太眞的環肥，「　國夫人承主恩，平明騎馬入宮門」，一個女子多麼尙武，當時的宮女也很健美威武。這裏有王建的宮詞爲證，「射生宮女宿紅妝，把得新弓各自張」。那時國家强盛，如日中天。到了南唐二主便一蹶不振。李後主旣然羅衾不耐五更寒」，無怪他要「沈腰潘鬢銷磨」了。宋初的花蕊夭人說孟蜀的滅亡是：「十四萬軍齊解甲，更無一個是男兒」。北宋徽欽二宗，不到城下之盟的時候，身體已支持不下了。南宋更頽廢，李淸照描寫女子「人比黃花瘦」，益見脆弱愁病。</p>
<p>從整個國家看、尤足證明健康·武功·與文化的一致。這是歷史的敎訓，坐實了文化不能與健康武事脫節。等到文勝於質的時候，便有亡國的危險。何况現在我們的「文」還遠不如人家！抗戰時期，我個人曾調查過一百萬壯丁的體格，第十屆至二十屆投考空軍的靑年，以及十决投考軍校的學生，身體及格的不過百分之三十，考空軍及格的平均不過百分之十左右。而體育家佔最多數。道眞够我們深思了。</p>
<p>今後的體育，要切切實實的施行。第一，敎育部的體育委員會應健全起來，現在該會的三位常務委員，聞有二位在外埠做事，一位又是東奔西走，如何能負得了重大責任？第二，自中央以至地方，所有體育行政人員，要有智識，有技術，有熱忱，允其對於建國要有抱負。第三，從速大量訓練學校體育師資及民衆體育人才。第四，儘量擴展民衆的體育塲。游泳池。體育館·和其他社會上體育的活動塲所。第五，建設並充實學校運動塲·游泳池·體育館。及其他體育設備。第六，日常注重大衆的和個別的體育，舉行運動會，該多些大羣參加的體育表演，少些個人的錦標比賽。看看我們的鄰居吧！看那被打倒的日本，再看抗戰勝利的蘇聯，他們的體育是何等的樣子？從這裏，就可以測量我們的前程，我們的生活，和我們的國家。（三十五，九，七·）</p>

<h3>適應原子戰爭時代需要　美海軍建造新戰艦　裝火箭砲設定向爆炸物　第三次原子彈試驗決無限期展延</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播：海上戰爭已進入革命性新紀元，美國新戰艦二艘，已裝有放射無綫電控制炸彈之配備。同時官方報導並證實：美方已設計製造抵抗原子彈　擊之原子戰艦二艘，其一為「肯塔基」戰艦，排水量四萬五千噸，其二為巡洋艦「夏威夷」號，排水量二萬七千噸。該兩戰艦為此次原子彈試騐後所產生者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕美國刻正建造原子時代第一批兵艦，艦上裝置火箭排砲，以代舊式大砲。海軍當局宣布：四萬五千噸戰艦「肯塔基」號，及二萬七千噸戰鬥巡洋艦「夏威互」號均將裝設定向爆炸物。兩艦本照舊式圖樣開遣，至二次大戰末期，火箭與原子彈出現，展開一新紀元，該兩艦乃重經設計。海軍設計家非正式表示：遠程定向炸彈可利用電波射出，或利用靶子本身之鋼鐵與熱力，引吸炸彈中的。但火箭裝置原子彈爆炸頭之計劃，尚在研究中。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓八日電〕在最近數星期中，美國之對蘇政策日趨強硬，尤以巴黎和會之發展與美南事件而益感明顯。但可能發生武裝衝突之說，實不足信，因尚有許多政治外安措置可以嘗試也。美國對莫斯科態度之轉趨強硬，似為國內民眾所贊成，若干專家且認為民間之　蘚情緒，其滋長情形較官方尤為迅速。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統本日領令，將預定明春舉行之第三次原子彈試騐，予以無限期展延，謂在最近將來，由深海試騐所能獲得之知識，與所費之代價相較，並不值得。據白宮新聞秘書羅斯稱：此次展期，並非停止舉行，僅為不定期延期而已。杜魯門作此決定，乃採納聯合參謀部，陸梅軍部長，及原子彈試騐評定委會之建議。據謂：科學家及軍事專家由歷次試騐所獲知識，已能估定陳子彈之效力。參謀部對於兩次試騐之成績，「極為滿意」云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯用意究安在正　秘密研究原子能　積極製造坦克大砲</h3>
<p>〔路透社瑞典京城七日電〕甫自蘇聯來此某消息靈通之美國蘇聯同題專家透露：蘇聯全境，密佈研究原子能秘密之研究所及實騐室，主其事者乃內閣會議副主席，前內政委員長貝利亞。該美國專家謂：其消息係自極可靠方面獲得，謂蘇政府不惜撥用鉅大研究經費，俾得實現莫洛托夫前此所稱「吾人亦將有原子彈」之語。渠復謂蘇聯科學家已獲知核心分化之大部份原理云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕「每日寫真」報本日指責蘇聯在德國合工廠內製造坦克，大砲，飛機，及火箭炸彈。略謂：蘇聯此種行動有秘密文件為證，揆其用意，殆恐遭受攻擊。此際英美兩國應毅然有所行動，迫使蘇聯在局勢不可收拾之前，透露真相云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯慶祝坦克節</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科八日電〕本日為蘇聯「坦克節」，史達林下令慶祝，第四鐵甲師團將在赤色廣場舉行演習。史達林在其布告中，對蘇聯锨甲隊在大戰中之功績備致讚揚，並稱道蘇坦克製造者之成功。本日學習時，莫斯科及全國各大都會，均將鳴祝砲二十響。</p>

<h3>外蒙代表返國</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕外蒙代表團一行五人，來紐約向安理會申請參加聯合國，未有結果。已於今日搭機，赴巴黎，轉返本國。代表團主席察登巴爾告記者稱，吾人希望下次能為聯合國接受，相信其他苦干國，不久能改變對我之態度。</p>
<h3>英閣將改組</h3>
<p>工黨左派不滿貝文</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕據悉：英內閣即將局部改組，陸海空三部均將受其影響，外部或亦將涉及。艾德禮早經宣佈具體計劃，擬在內閣中羅致青年人才，使其富於朝氣。但最近局勢已陷困難，工黨左派份子對外相貝文，抨擊甚力，尤以希臘公民投票問題，最受非難。預料陸海空三部人事調動時，現任海相亞歷山大在內閣中將有顯著升遷。</p>

<h3>尼羅河空前泛濫　受原子彈爆炸影響</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅八日電〕尼羅河定期泛濫，五千年來不越常軌，最近忽呈異態，水位之高，幾與堤岸相齊，為二百年來所未見，埃及各灌溉家均莫名其所以。此在氣象學家，則以為最近比基尼島兩次原子彈爆炸試騐，已使同溫層發生影響，加速沿赤道之兩點凝結，尼羅河水位高漲，原因在此云。</p>
<h3>南對義領土要求　烏克蘭代表全力支持　法國所提分界綫如不予修正　南聲明將拒簽對義任何和約</h3>

<h3>渡英吉利海峽到巴黎去（下）　藝術之都咖啡氣濃</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>卡萊火車站上，無人來檢查護照。列車不久即開行，初時頗令記者詫異，為什麼可以入國境而不查護照？早知如此，又何必事先一定要辦Visa呢？豈非多事？後來方知即在車子開行期間，按人檢查。原來從卡萊赴巴黎的專車，從渡船接着旅客，直接開至巴黎，中間並不停留，所以決無旅客會在中途下車。車行近四小時，儘有檢查的時間，所以這套手續無庸擠在卡萊麻煩了。這倒是法國人辦事機靈之處。在法國境內，車子是法國式的，車廂寬闊，和英國車相同，而英國車設二個座位的地方，法國車要設三個座位，所以不免顯得擁擠些。車廂壁上，却有許多裝飾品，這是英國車上所無的，足見藝術天性，是隨處流露的。從</p>
<p>卡萊到巴黎，車行約四小時。沿途盡是田疇茂林真可以算得上沃野千里了。威處可以望見農人耕作其間，現在正是秋收季節，隨時有滿載黃橙橙農作物的馬車，緩緩拖向鄰近的田舍去。這裏的景色很有點像中國的大江南北而不似英國。英國鄉間，坡邱起伏，難得見到一望無垠的平壤，且人口稠密，屋宇櫛比，縱有廣原，亦多闢為公園，種植花草，作為人民遊憇之所。英國的草地特別多，隨處皆是，每到假日，草地上總　遊人憩息其間，舉行野餐，消磨假日。我常覺得整個英國是一片大花園，除了住屋外，便是供人玩賞的地方了。農田自然也是有的，但在英國，並不佔重要地位。據英國的農林部統計：全英國以務農為主業的人，約共七十萬，祇佔全人口的百分之一稍強，難怪</p>
<p>英國田圃少了。且英國的農業，多數是牧畜，果園，或種植蔬菜，很少有種植稻麥的，且業農的人，也多數用機器代勞力，偶見田野中有人工作時，總是有小引擎在田畦上開來開去，少有實際手作的，所以總不免感覺異樣。今見了法國的農村，驀地令人廻想到國內情形，真有如歸之感。在法國的農田中，還見到許多歸女小孩，在協助工作，這也是與中國相像之處，而是為英國所無的。車到巴黎，已在傍晚，在旅館中放下行裝，稍事休憩，即由朋友帶至馬路上去散步，看看巴黎的夜色，也好讓初進城的鄉吧老，開開眼界。巴黎雖然也有狹窄的街道，但主要馬路，却廣闊开期，而且正直，一望無底，氣派果然比倫敦大得多。至於道旁店舖，屋宇，及櫥窗裝飾之巧與美，尤為倫敦所望塵莫及。也正因為馬路寬，人行道尤其闊的緣故，</p>
<p>巴黎咖啡店都以四五排几椅，置於店前人行道上，梧桐蔭下，讓顧客坐着喝咖啡，看行人。據說每到下午，座客漸多，入夜更盛，這又是英國所沒有的。英國餐館和咖啡店，至黃昏時即關門，所以無論怎樣熱鬧的街道，到傍晚七八點鐘時，便靜悄悄地少有行人了。許多在臨睡前有吃消夜習慣的國人，初到英國，不知英國風尚，入夜滿街亂找食舖，總是失望，叫苦連天。法國咖啡店中的夜市，却不讓於國內小吃店，這是法國人天生皆有藝衛家，性格的特色每當燈月交輝，座客滿時，男女座客，互相笑謔嬉暱，但知追求人生快樂，任行人觀賞，了無顧忌，據戰前到過法國的人說：</p>
<p>巴黎的繁華，現在雖又逐漸恢復，但與戰前相較，已大有今不如昔之慨了。我不知在德軍佔領期間，巴黎青年，是否也有如此　譽？又萬一不幸，而未能勝戰，這些青年，又該到那裏去尋歡逐樂？或又該到那裏去熬受人生的苦味？法國香水本來出名，無庸記者多說了，但奇怪的是縱在廣闊的馬路上，也時時嗅到脂粉氣息，至於室內的　香不絕，更是不在話下了，彷彿整片籠罩巴黎的空氣，都讓香水胭脂氣味滲透了，這是令初到巴黎的人，所特殊領略到的異味。難怪有若干勤工儉學的藝術家，自第一次歐戰時來此，至今不願回國，寧願終老此鄉，聽說現在還靠着教育部的留學津貼渡日。</p>

<h3>經濟部長王雲五　暢談今後施政重心　扶植民營事業提倡節約增產　各地設立工商督導處</h3>
<p>經濟部長王　五，昨在私邸接見記者，對該部今後工作重心，有扼要之闡述·渠稱：本人不　高談計劃，向主實事求是，中國應當工業化，應當趨向計　的自由經濟，自無間題。現在且從本部工作談起，本部成立於戰時，最初農林，水利及資源委員會各部門，均屬木部統　範圍。自農林水利分出後，範圍已漸縮小，惟仍有一龐大之附屬機構，資源委員會在內，抗戰期間，資委會在國營事業中，居重要地位，供獻很大，各項事業俱係由經濟部直接指示辦理。最近資委會又巳分出，在如此範圍下之經濟部，工作重心，限制於經濟行政部份，但本人對此極表贊同。</p>
<p>小範圍內做大事業</p>
<p>蓋本人做事，　喜「小題大做」，而不願「大題小做」，同時我們看蘇聯這個國家，農工業部分，差不多分成二十幾部，例如化學工業部，機械工業部等等，都是在小範圍內做大事業，可資說明。今後本部對於經濟行政工作，一面統籌督導國營事業之改良，一面扶植推進民營事業之發展，責任更爲重大。簡言之，即本部今後之重要工作扶植，督導，監　等項，責無旁貸，自當竭盡智能，克達使命。爲具體辦理上列三大工作起見，本部現擬在全國各重要工商地區，設立工商督導處，代表經濟部協助民營工商事業，推進復員工作，並舉辦工貸，以增加生產效能，純粹爲民營工商界服務，該機構與各省市建設廳社會局原有工商行政業務，並無抵觸，現已擇定上海，天津，漢口，廣州，重慶，瀋陽七處，先行設置，下月內即在普遍成立。該處成立之光，原有經濟部派駐各該地之特派員辦公處，應即結束。</p>
<p>眼光放大忍苦一時</p>
<p>對於如何平衡國際收入一點，王氏稱：目前貿易上入超現象，在國家工業復員初期，實屬無可避免，但情形亦有兩樣，不可一概言之，例如有些國家，人民能够節的縮食，降低消費水準，以此換取工業原料，機器，增加生產，則入超乃屬正常之謂，有些國家，人民不但不能節衣縮食，反而放浪奢侈，極度享受，則入超自然非常危險。我國居於這兩種情態的中間，近朱者赤，近墨者黑，目前實在是値得我們警惕的時候。兩個月前，本人在市商會開會時，曾說節的問題非常重要，果然上海市也已成立節約運動委員會，現在大家都說上海市電力不够，但是試問各商店通宵達且的霓紅燈，是否可以節省，而以之代爲工廠用電，舉一反三，就是說大家都要刻苦，大家都刻苦，外國貨奢侈品，根本無法進口，希望全國人民，大家都把眼光放長，忍苦一時，而促進將來國家工業化的成就。因此，談到要挽救入超的危機，第一，就要人民節約，第二，要减低國貨成本，第三要提高國貨品質，對於進口貿易如此，出口貿易也要如此，大家要時刻警懼着，一句話就是「第一個日本打倒了，第二個日本也許又要來」。王氏繼復說明，要平衡貿易收支，決非單靠提高外匯，免除出口稅，所能收效，還是要靠政府人民通力合作，奉行節的，增加生產，扌是根本辦法。</p>
<p>國營期內中紡使命</p>
<p>談及中紡公司業務情形，王氏稱：中紡公司每月業務收入，現均解繳國庫，數字相當鉅大，對平衡國庫收支，不無裨益。公司本身恢復工作，相當緊張，天津，靑島各廠，均已接收復，外人批評「國營事業，不如民營事業辦得好」似不可一槪而論，雖然如此，中紡仍將遵照政府諾言，於兩年最多三年內，完全移歸民營，國營期間之中紡，使命有二：（一）全部復工，（二）復工走上軌道，俟使命完成後，當即交給民營，至於將來移交民營方式，不外三種：（一）各廠個別標售（二）各廠個別組織公司，出賣股票，（三）整個公司出賣股票，究採何種方式，目前尙未決定。談到此，記者復提出兩問題，由王氏答覆如次：</p>
<p>（問）東北最近缺棉，人民衣着恐慌，對各地紡織事業之恢復生產，部方是否已有計劃？</p>
<p>（答）本部對於東北資源現有設備，當儘量利用，協助民營企業之移殖發展，凡與民生工業有關者，常以求得自給自足爲目樣，紡織本業亦爲其中之一·要自給自足，當然要擴充生產，　充生產，幷無關內關外之分，物資供應範圍，亦無區域限制，現東北各地紡織廠，中紡公司已開始接收，當可籌劃復工。</p>
<p>問：最近人造絲價格暴漲原因何在？政府存貨如何？已否有平抑辦法？</p>
<p>答：（一）人造絲暴漲原因，實爲奸商讓斷居奇所形成，（二）政府對於存貨如何，不願說明，但最近政府巳向日本以易貨方式，訂購大量成品，　批本星期日即可抵滬，該批定貨足　一年之用，供　市塲，無　缺乏。</p>

<h3>王曉籟　在中南貿易協會茶會中　談東北　東北富·民衆苦</h3>
<p>東北救濟會代表王曉籟，上月六日與于斌主敎由京飛平，轉道東北慰問難胞，公畢，於本月三日晚偕同返滬。本市巾南貿易協會，昨日上午十時舉行茶會，由王曉籟氏講述東北現况，並函邀新聞界出席參加。王氏即席以「談東北」爲題，歷述東北之見聞甚詳。據渠稱：今日之東北情形已詳於于斌主敎之談話中，茲僅就束北之富與東北民衆之苦，簡而言之。同時王氏並擬邀工商界人士，　　東北考察團北上，籍明東北情形。羣策羣力，以謀開發東北。此項建議，近將提諸市商會討論，以期早日實現云。</p>
<p>王氏首先講述東北救濟之組織，係由蔣夫人任會長，莫德惠任副會長，全部賑款僅二億三千萬元，經政府之協助，易取同樣數目之東北流通券，實等於卅餘億元，使東北難胞，受惠匪淺。至此，王氏即詳述抵東北後出席數次民衆大會情形，東北民衆均極興奮而感謝本會之救濟。此外並參觀淸陽，鞍山，撫順，四平，長春，吉林等地之工業廠，參觀之餘，深覺東北一草一木，均極偉大，東北在淪陷十四年中，日人建設極多，據王氏認爲，日人在東北，實異於東南，在東北除努力建設之外，實未有絲毫之破壞，並賴東北之生產，支持八年戰爭，惟此種工業區，目下僅有其表，內部機械多被某方搬走，後復　共軍之破壞燒燬，使此富有之東北，遭此創傷，恐非一短時間可恢復。王氏更作痛心之語，「搶是別人搶，燒是自己燒，」可見今日東北之一般，大好山河，而竟成瓦礫。王氏前後又談及東北民衆之苦，即東北氣候嚴寒，本年冬季，東北民衆，衣住及警藥等項，均成嚴重問題，苟不未雨綢繆，則今冬東北同胞，雖不亡於餒，而必死於凍，閉目思之，實不堪設想。允希政府當局注意及之云。</p>
<h3>太平洋上兩颱風</h3>
<p>據氣象台消息：太平洋發現之小颱風，頃已進抵海南島附近，又昨日上午六時在北緯一四·三〇度東經一三八度之關島西部發現另一颱風，現正向西北西猛力推進中，風力當在七級以上，中國大陸是否將遭襲擊，現尙未能確定。茲悉上海氣象台氣象報告於後：</p>

<h3>傷心義士未及睹昇平各界昨晨追悼邵虛白</h3>

<h3>白露前後蟋蟀肥　五馬路一帶市場熱鬧　每天出達一萬餘頭</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上帝創造世界的時候，已制定了「競爭」的必需存在。在大自然中，弱肉强食，原是司空見慣的事。性好自粗殘殺的，實在不少，蟋蟀不過是此中代表吧了！</p>
<p>前天白露，是蟋蟀的黃金時代，稍有玩蟋蟀經騐的人都曉得，白露前七天和白露後七天，這半個月中的蟋蟀最旺盛也最善鬥。這幾天街頭巷尾，比較冷靜的馬路邊，蹲着一羣一羣的孩子，逗　蟋蟀，驅使他們爭戰、以滿足他們的「勝利慾」，而發洩人類好鬥本性。這並不盡是小孩的玩意兒，在這大都市中，正不知有多少有閑階級，紈袴子弟，瘋在般的畜養着，利用作爲賭博的工具。</p>
<p>五馬路，六馬路，近西藏路一帶專買虫魚花鳥的小店，便兌本市蟋蟀的供應地。他們在浦東，龍華，漕河涇，以及嘉興，杭州，南京，江北各地，佈置着收購蟋蟀的機構，有特約的客商，每天從產地大批運來。普通的蟋蟀每隻盛裝在一枚小竹管裏，特別强大的扌優待在磚盆中。他們稱之爲「落盆貨」。據說；最高的價格有數萬元一隻的。普通的「落盆貨」，大約二萬元到七八千元左右。因爲沒有一定的貨價標準，所以蟋蟀的價格也隨着主題的新老而高低。他們經常供給公館的大少爺，並不是依數　價的，而是取給於「賞賜」·</p>
<p>玩蟋蟀有個四　缺，叫：「乾，老，細，糯。」乾者，蟋蟀的產地要乾燥，可以從顏色上辦別。老者，蟋蟀的年齡是否太嫩，是否太老，可以從「脚花」肢足上　別。細者身軀要細，過　的不善鬥。糯者，轉身是否靈活，應付敵人是否聰明。此非老經騐不能辨別。依照顏色還有重靑，紫靑，白靑等類別。黃頭紅牙一定是好貨。白牙宜於深秋決鬥。最要點是：頭要大，身要細。總是上乘之物。假使以產地來說，要推「杭虫」——杭州，紹興，諸曁產的最好。據說五馬路一帶小店每日要賣出蟋蟀一萬多隻。通常小孩玩玩的，有一百元二隻，二百元三隻，較高的有五百元八百元一隻的。</p>
<h3>美影片大量湧到　話劇界臨近末日</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的話劇界，由絢爛而歸於平淡，這種現象是可怕而又嚴重的！留在上海的人們應該記得，當話劇量煊赫的時期，它擁有十個塲子——蘭心，卡爾登，辣斐，麗華，金城，金都，新光，巴黎九星，美華。然而，目前已經减少到祇剩二家蘭心和光華。話劇在風雨飄搖之中，愛好劇藝的人，都在爲它祖心：話劇的末日到了。</p>
<p>話劇界雖然已經到了最低潮，然而它過去的光榮的戰鬥史，依然不可泯滅。淪陷期間漫長的黑夜裏，話劇所表現的作品，除了少數比較無聊的喜劇外，大多數演比較溫和灰暗的現實主義的戲劇。而戲劇界本身，從來未有呼應敵僞戲的演出，有了唯「華影」主持的，與「反英美協會」合作的「江舟泣血記」，與僞警局防犯科合作的「回頭是岸」。</p>
<p>·苦幹一番演員求去·</p>
<p>勝利之後，由於美國影片的大量湧到，時髦的先生小姐都被吸引住了，話劇逐漸被壓倒，短時期內，話劇院驟减至卡爾登，辣　，光華，　華等四家，（蘭心是不定期的劇塲。」雖說劇塲範圍縮小，而營業依然不振。由重慶來滬的劇人主持的上海劇藝社在「光華」演出之初，賣座異常悽慘，要不是「陞官圖」發財，這個有歷史性的劇團早垮了。此外，在辣斐作長期公演的「苦幹」。一方面受經濟的壓迫，另一方面則因爲歷年以來沒有確立排演制度，演員個別發展的結果，使演員與導演之間裂開一條鴻溝——演員輕視導演，漠視戲劇的綜合性，以爲憑演員幾套絕話就能應付演出。這樣以導演佐臨爲中心的「苦幹」的內部起了裂紋，演員紛紛求去，「苦幹」就此解體。</p>
<p>但是物以類聚，兩種對戲劇不同認識的人，分成兩個陣營。——一是以營利爲前提，以明星制度爲手段的演員們，他們以提高演員待遇爲號召，組織演員自己劇團，他們曾演「雷雨」，現在正演「文天祥」。「是張駿祥領導的「中電」，因爲他們的嚴肅的演出態度，一時無法克服上海觀衆低級趣味的欣賞，所以他們的演出「萬世師表」「大地回春」便也在經濟上遭遇了很大的打擊，於是這一支眞軍，便與佐臨在嚴肅的工作態度上合流，在最近組織了觀衆演劇公司，他們在秋凉之後，在辣斐打新旗幟，演出楊村彬導演的「淸宮外史」。</p>
<p>·看破紅塵上藝結束·</p>
<p>在太平洋之戰中崛起的「上藝」，是劇壞的一支溢流，費穆領導了一羣人，解散「華新影業公司」，收藏起已經攝好的「國色天香」「洪宣嬌」，就決定了他們與敵僞不合作的態度，他們以解散「上藝」拒絕參加紀念僞府還都紀念的「家」的演出，他們曾跟梅熹梅阡與日本浪人的「報導部」合辦的「綜藝」鬥爭，他們雖是在地層內潛潛的流，而他們都是永遠保持溫度，淸白，不停地流。然而在勝利到來以後，他們也遭遇對了經濟上的打擊。在上月份他們得到前台——卡爾登的通諜：要修理房屋，改映電影，着於月底遷出。於是這有四年光榮戰鬥歷史的劇團，在演出紀念戲「紅塵」之後，便宣告結束了。</p>
<p>·紅樓一夢後台虧本·</p>
<p>「麗華」這僩小劇塲，始終在風雨飄搖中，因爲塲子小，小戲觀衆少，大戲即使客滿也要賠錢，上月演出的「紅樓夢」便是一個例子，生意十分好，結果後台還是要虧本。現在，這個沒有組織，沒有太多演員的「新美」也結束了，「麗華」的後局，雖說要演「雷峯塔」，但也有改演紹興戲的可能。</p>
<p>「蘭心」是英國人的產業，他不肯長期的租給任何一個劇團，因爲他們自己有歌舞劇團，作不走期的公演，他們並且要租與音樂團和白俄所組織的「歌劇」與「巴蕾」的演出。目前在演出的是全部明星制的「文天祥」最近消息傳來，這個理想的戲院，恐將改演電影了。那麽話劇的前途更將黯淡了。</p>
<p>·上實演員風流雲散·</p>
<p>連演三個月「陞官圖」，使光華的「上劇」有了較好的基礎，現正公演的「孔雀膽」，遠在二個月前已往開始排演了。雖然主題與演出極爲嚴　，但是賣座仍不佳，所以這眞是個嚴重的問題，上海僅有二家話劇院，而營業均不能維持，「中國演劇社」耗費了二千餘萬資本，開出的第一砲「文天祥」，還是不響，據聞生意照樣不佳。而這二家劇　都沒有雄厚的資本，都是虧不起的　還有，上海實騐劇團，曾在「蘭心」演出過「新官上任」和「春寒」，虧了一千八百餘萬，最近「上實」的演員如陶余，舒　文等，原爲「中萬」演員，排就了「淸　外史」，要到南京去。是否再參加「上實」，也是個問題。</p>
<p>此外上海戲劇界有一個戲劇協會，曾經開過幾次會，它唯一的工作，是組織了「特委會」，從事審査並檢舉影劇奸逆工作，但是至今沒有結果。有一個戲劇界福利會，供過一點錢給貧病的藝人。有一個演員聯誼會，曾經開渦會，想演幾個小戲沒有成功。有一個戲劇學校，本來不十分結實，現在有一些專家來上海，他的敎授陳也就堅強了。</p>
<p>目前，上海戯劇界正在低潮的時候，可怕的是，剷團紛紛結束。可悲的是大半戯劇工作者　書本子也懶得摸了。</p>

<h3>體育節的意義　上海市體育節籌委會</h3>
<p>卅年九月九日，國民政府令頒修正國民體育法，用定斯“爲體育節，是則體育節之規定，爲推行國民體育法無疑矣，此其一。</p>
<p>修正國民體育法頒布之日，正値抗戰吃緊之時，鑒於應召入伍之壯丁，經檢査體格合格者，十僅二三兵源之嚴重得未曾有，是則體育節之規定，端在促起國民之普遍注意體育，提高民族健康水準，使平時爲一且有效能之生產者，戰時爲一捍衛國家之勇士，而不浪費軍火，此其二。</p>
<p>年年今日，全國各省市，例有各種體育活動，點綴此節，就形式言，提倡體育，已盡能事，然揆諸實際，成效至微，原因云何，曰一日曝之，十日寒之耳，曰經費無着，點綴而已，曰塲地不敷，設備簡陋，故紀念體育節，第一，須將運動一事，列爲日常生活中每天不可或缺之一個節目，第二，政府必須將國民體育經費，按照國民體育法，列入國家之總預算，第三，大量興建體育塲，並充實其設備，良以用武必須有塲，工欲善其事，必先利其器，此其三。</p>
<p>「九九」又爲昨歲南京受降之日，是則今後紀念斯節，更含有雙重意義，西諺云：「靑年的胸膛，即是國防」，我人於此，宜知反省，此其四。</p>
<p>體育者何？其最新定義，爲「從身體活動中來敎育」與德育智育構成一個等邊三角形，不能割裂，如將三育分立，使整個之等邊三角形，變成三個獨立的一邊，則德。體。智。三者均損傷其本身的生命，削弱其作用，此其五。</p>
<h3>六分團田徑總測驗　王學武標槍破全國</h3>

<h3>首都空軍籃球隊　一分受挫於仁餘　結果四十三比四十二分　上半時二十比十八分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕雖非籃球季節，唯以各地籃球隊紛紛來滬，故最近本市籃球，勢將展開偉大塲面。昨夜八時，在體育館內，南京空軍籃球隊，首戰本市勁旅仁餘隊，結果上半時廿對十八，總結果四十三對四十二，遠征軍以一分遭慘敗。</p>
<p>空軍實力</p>
<p>綜觀空軍實力，個人技術可稱在水準綫上，缺點則在全隊合作功夫，未見佳妙，又以所用進攻與守衛方法，俱屬已成過去之戰術，守用五人聯防術，攻則徒恃毫無把握之遠射，惟亦不能以成敗論英雄，客軍之拼的精神，確亦有可稱道者，初次在此偉大塲面之下，或有失常之表演，且觀其後。茲略述昨戰簡情於下；</p>
<p>競爭經過</p>
<p>兩隊準時登塲，裁判劉荷生金家標，客軍求勝心切，上塲初犯規累累，仁餘賴罰球先獲四分佔先，始見劉振元中的，但仁餘又見猖獗，用中央突破一法，又見奏效，以八對二遙領，嗣後空軍合力反攻，賴遠射得分，漸漸這上，上半時仁餘仍以二〇對十八勝一球。易邊之後，自二十四對二三後，客軍王賀林一射中的，始見超出，自此維持五分鐘時間，客軍佔先四五分之間，惟該隊無法守禦，仁餘梁永佳生龍活虎，偸襲而入，無不成功，故結果總以四三對四二擊退客軍。</p>

<h3>體育節與國民體育</h3>
<p>— 邵汝幹</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，已臨週年，今日欣逢體育佳節，中央與省市，分別舉辦各項體育活動，以資紀念，含義深長，値得稱頌。在此體育佳節，由創鉅痛深之中，走上建國復興之道，悲慘的憧憬，換了勝利的愉快，受降紀念佳節並蒞，更覺興奮與歡忭。建國之道固多，而國民體育之建設，實爲强健民族之本。大凡民族的盛表，是基於國民體力的累積，國民體力強壯，則民族亦隨之而強盛，反之，必爲衰弱之民族。我中華民族體力如何，國民體育之落後，民族體格之危機，是抱着莫大之隱憂，根據專家調査統計，美國人民平均壽命爲六十歲，我國人民平均壽命爲三十歲，在抗戰期間，因新兵的經騐，以及海陸空各種學校招生，檢査靑年體格之結果，證明及格者，實在太少，空軍佔百分之四，徵兵則爲百分之廿五，大部分不能配合服兵條件，而一般國民體力之孱弱，允足以影響整個的國力，戰後五强之一，應有强國强民强種之對稱。</p>
<p>我國提倡體育，已卅餘年於茲，或因地廣民衆，未易普及全民，或因人才經濟關係，組織與環境，未能適應時代要求，或因民情習尙所趨，未能迎合現代體育思潮，雖經各方熱忱提倡，同志努力推行，而內在因素，外鑠影響，其進步程度，無顯著之表露，體育從業人員，當然要負責任，而國民缺乏自我興起之精神，亦爲其大原因也。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，敎育部爲喚起全國人民注意體育訓練，並擴大民族運動宣傳起見，於民國卅一年六月九日，第二二一一五六號部令頭發體育節（九月九日）舉行辦法要點，由各省市教育行政機關，應於體育節日，分別負責舉辦國民體育活動，並邀集所在地區之學校機關團體，組辦委員會辦理之，並定體育節前一星期爲宣傳週，刋物報紙，用文字宣傳，將重要活動方法，由機關學校員生，分赴民間宣傳，至體育活動項目，因地囚人而定，如國術，競走，爬山，游泳，騎馬，划船，賽車，舉東，球類，田徑等，可酌量採用，在宣傳體育意義及方法外，適應當地環境，作各項體育活動。</p>
<p>勝利週年之體育節，除敎育部公佈辦法要點外，中央宣傳部，三民主義靑年團中央團部，國防部，敎育部，社會部代電，又有配合推行民族健康運動中心工作之指示，（一）舉行市民健康運動，（二）市民運動大會，（三）民族健康講座，（四）舉行公共塲所及街道清潔大檢査，（五）放映衛生敎育電影，（六）擴大民族健康運動宜傳週。</p>
<p>今日爲體育節日，全國各大都市，舉行體育活戰，在此紀念佳節，是勝利後大規模之建國運動，　往策來，如何建設新中國之國民體育，良以紀念體育節是一個有力的運動，也是全民體育的開端，無分男女老幼，不論學晨工商，多要認識淸楚，體育訓練，是一種權利，訓練體育，是一種義務，個個享受權利，人人應盡義務，然後國民體育，始有普遍發展之望，或日體育節是體育從　員或熱心體育活動者之世界，此種錯覺，應當糾正。</p>
<p>佳節當臨，倍覺興奮，我們要以紀念佳節的精神，繼續不斷的推行，則對此體育節紀念日，才有意義，我們要加緊建設國民體育，方不負紀念體育節之眞諦。</p>
<p>體育節之各項活動，是促進全民體育之動機，重要原則，的述如下：</p>
<p>（一）體育運動要普遍化：希望個個國民，多有從事運動之機會。</p>
<p>（二）體育運動要組織化：不論縱橫組織，各學校各團體，各階層的人羣社會，大家起來建立一個合理的體育運動組織。</p>
<p>（三）體育運動要國防化：注意現代國防軍事訓練，航空基本學識技能訓練，必須切實推行。</p>
<p>（四）體育運動要學術化：應適現代體育思潮，訓練健全幹部人才，以及體育學術之進修。</p>
<p>（五）體育運動要經濟化：現在財力物力維艱，用較少的經濟，盡最大的力量。</p>
<p>爲政不在多言，工作惟有苦幹，在體育節紀念之時，筆者深致其股切之願望，上海爲全國體育的搖籃，又應首先創導，全國體育界同志們，大家起來，共同努力，以完成其應負之使命。</p>

<h3>中國醫學院　照常招生開課</h3>
<p>中國醫學院，為名中醫朱鶴皋所創辦，外傳敎育部有加以取締之說，茲悉不確，聞受敎部取締者，爲上海及新中國兩中醫學院，至於中國醫學院，並未奉到部令，故該院現仍繼續招生，照常課開。</p>
<h3>音專戴校長表示　將擴大音樂教育</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪國立音專戴校長粹倫，據談：該校正於困難之條件下，籌備複課，該校原有江灣校址，已在修復巾，下期開學決以原址爲校舍，山校方備車接送敎授。至於本市愛文義路六二六號校址，則撥作敎職員宿舍。該校以係國立，收費有限，敎授待遇較爲菲薄，故聘請敎授頗爲不易，但校方仍竭力設法補救，延聘中外名樂家爲敎授。據戴氏稱：校方準備不久設立幼年班及交響樂團，擴大推行音樂敎育。校方現擁有鋼琴廿餘架，尙有數架大鋼琴，係向外國定購，即將運來使用。記者順間以爵士音樂問題，戴氏答稱：即使是爵士業，也必須奏得像樣，目今上海舞塲之音樂，演奏者技巧太差，內容極爲混雜，所以造成今日之現象，總之，還是要普遍提高一般音樂水準，則過於低流之音樂，自無其存在之餘地云云。</p>
<h3>武漢七聯處查禁翻版課本　小學生上學不上課</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口訊〕武漢公私立各小學，雖皆於九月一日舉行開學典禮，但正式上課之期，迄今（七日）尙無眉目。小學生上學而不能「上課」，深感焦灼。據各校負責人談稱：不能即時上課，實有種種困難原因：（一）校址多被軍隊借住，一時不能遷讓。（二）學校數目太少，失學兒童太多，每校均有人滿之患，各方面介紹請求之學生，反超過收容量二倍以上。（三）因翻版敎科書之書局，與七聯供應處査禁翻版交涉，尙未解決，不能如期供應，即屬一二校能提早上課，又因正式國定課本，須由滬運漢，一時亦無書可讀國。（四）延聘合格而富經騐之敎師，實亦困難。</p>

<h3>德孚卜內門派貨　士林一千四百萬元</h3>
<p>德孚洋行對於各廠配貨，停止近月。聞近日有配士林消息，價每六十公斤，約一千四百萬元，上期配價近一千萬元，已漲四成，而市場黑價，則超出二千萬元矣。致陰丹士林染價，各染廠因原料猛漲，已調整至三萬四千元至三萬六千元間。卜內門燒堿，自前月配給染廠，以十六萬一桶。在外匯調整前有以二十六萬配給廠商之意，後因外匯變動，公司方面，停止配給。現又有開派之說，價常在四十萬元以上。據聞美國定貨價格，亦已增至美金一角六分一磅，加保險費及運費等，可見來本已增。如卜內門再不配給，價格恐有上升之勢。</p>

<h3>健全證券市場之建立</h3>
<p>— 楊蔭溥</p>
<p>吾國資本薄弱，產業落後。至今公司組織，未能普遍採行；基本企業，未見大量發展。一方集資募股，深惑困難；而他方游散資金，充斥市面。此種矛盾現象，造因雖非一端，而缺乏健全之證券市場，以致長期資金呆滯失靈者，無疑為其最主要原因之一。行政院有鑒於斯，爰於五月間有積極籌組上海證券市場之訓令。當時指定杜　為籌備委員會主任委員，王志莘為副主任委員，徐寄廎·錢新之·俞寰澄等七人為委員。籌備委員會成立後，即積極進行籌備工作。諸如擬訂公司章程及各項章則，審核經犯人資格，審核上市證券，修理市場，佈置人事等，先後均告就緒。歷時三月，於本日正式開業。奠定資本市場之始基，不可謂非吾國金融史上可大書時書之盛舉。</p>
<p>（一）此次新設機構之特點</p>
<p>此次觀成之「上海證券交易所」，近則承接戰前「上海華商證券交易所」之基礎，遠可追溯民初「上海股票商業公會」及證券業「茶會」之統緒。一方接受舊有之系統，一方創建健全之新猷，其特點之可得言者，厥有三端：一曰，完成統一組織；一曰，建立擴大基礎；一曰，確定市場性質。</p>
<p>甲　完成統一組織上海之有證券市場，非自今日始；而上海證券之有統一集中市場，則不可謂非自今日成立之「上海證券交易所」始。「上海證券物品交易所」證券部份存在時代，上海同時並存之證券市場有三；「上海證券物品交易所」證券部份合併以後，在「上海華商證券交易所」及西商「上海眾業公所」並峙之局面下，上海同時並存之證券市場，尚非一而為二。此次新成立少機構，一方承受「上海華商證券交易所」之統緒，一方兼納西商「上海眾業公所」之營業，以上海唯一之市場，創前此未有之統一局面，此其特點一。</p>
<p>乙　建立擴大基礎戰前原有之證券市場，華商方面，則以本國公會為中心；西商方面，則以外商同業為中心。基礎各有所偏，營業遂成割據。此次新成立之機構，於交易所本身組織方面，則除舊有股東外，益以國家五行局之投資，此為基礎擴大之一方面。更就核准經紀人之範圍言之，則除包含舊有本國「公會」同業及西商「眾業」會員外，兼羅銀錢信託各榮之法人經紀人，以及其他曾經營或管理證券投資業務，合於規定資格之個人經紀人，此為基礎擴大之又一方面。包羅多面，融洽一爐，基礎擴大，實力隨增，此其特點二</p>
<p>丙　確定市場性質戰前之華商市場，其開拍證券，均屬政府公債，其功用限於財政盈虛之調節，嚴格言之，贊祇可謂為「財政市場」。戰前之西商市場，其上市證券，均屬外商股票，其功用限於外商資金之活潑，嚴格言之，實祗可謂為「外資市場」。一則偏重財政，一則偏重外商，與大國企業所需資金，不發生如何聯繫，實均不能福為真正之長期資金市場，或資本市場。此次新設市場之營業範圍，以本國企業發行之股票債券為其中心，而兼及政府所發行之公債，以及外商在華發行之證券，一方雖並蓄兼收，一方則輕重有別，資本市場之性質，終以確定，此其特點三。</p>
<p>（二）證券市場應有之功能</p>
<p>欲產業作合理之發展，有可充分利用之資金，無疑為其最主要條件之一。「可充分利用」，即指此項資金可加運用之時間，必與產業實際需要此項週轉之時間相配合。產業設備所需要之資金，大衹為期校長，為數較鉅。為數較鉅故必設法開闢多面吸收之途徑；為期較長，故必設法增強資金流通之能力。是則舍使之「證券化」外，似無更優之辦法。</p>
<p>「長期資金證券化」之口號，於民國二十三年間，已為當時有識之士所主張，所提倡。而「長期資金證券化」之最重要關鍵，即在健全證券市場之建立。證券市場對此方面所具之功能，其最主要者，可舉三端：一曰，增強資金流通能力；二曰，擴大資金來源基礎；三曰，指示投資有效途徑。</p>
<p>甲·增強資金流動能力　資金具證券之形式，始成為可以流動之工具；證券有買賣之市場，始獲得可資流動之途徑。長期投資，所懼者呆攔，所患者欲變現時無法脫手，換言之，即最易缺乏流動之能力。今付以證券之形式，並設有買賣之市場，則隨時可以脫手，即隨時可以收回其所投之資金。從此形式雖為長期之投資，而實際則含有短期之作用，其活動能力，自可大見增強。同時具此高度活動能力之證券，必且成金融界良好之抵押對象。故此項投資，雖屬長期；然以之拋售，立刻可以變現；以之作理，立刻可以各款。不患其呆擱，更不患其無法脫手。此因有證券市場之存在，而增強資金流動之能力者，其功能一，（未完）</p>
<h3>紙漿漲一成</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕物價管理局宣佈：本國及舶來木質紙漿漲價約百分之十，估計使用木質紙漿之造紙廠每年將增加成本二干五百萬元。</p>
<h3>廠經盤旋　人絲漲起五十萬　綢貨隨原料看漲</h3>
<p>人造絲在上週一二，做價為二百廿五六萬元，頗形平穩，次日起，實銷活躍，即漲起十餘萬元，週四，中紡公司停止配給，人心大受刺激，且利用一二〇號有光無貨可配之機會，墨市狂抬，是日竟大起二十餘萬元，週末又高十五萬元，總計一週內抬高五十萬元之鉅，雜牌有光及半光，俱亦跟進，各好起四五十萬元不等，一五〇號有光比一二〇號更貴，漲起六十餘萬元，廠經洋行交易有限，兼之銀根甚緊，欲漲乏力，上週內盤旋上落，只有四五萬元之差額，週末與週一價相彷，綢貨銷路漸見起色，且因原料高昂，各貨一致報漲，七週內約增百分之十強，然與原料相較。尚不免見絀，據各廠商云，倘原料不能抑低，綢貨成本攸關，尚須看漲云。</p>

<p>生產建設</p>
<h3>勝利一年</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>勝利以來，轉瞬一年，在道一年之中，欲言生產建設，實在很可以使人感慨。因爲種種關係，一般生產事業，都在困難中苦鬥，成效很少。</p>
<p>實際上，在抗戰期間，因爲物資缺乏，幣制貶値，在一般工廠，每天在增加帳面上的數字，對於工作效率等不暇顧到，也不必顧到，所以也可以說對於戰後建設階級所需要的努力，並沒有做準備的工作。</p>
<p>等到勝利以後，許多情形，未能盡合理想，於是困難重重，感覺應付爲難，不像英美各國的工業，因爲戰時使他們努力生產，到了和平以後，就能够迅速地恢復到正常的生產。</p>
<p>一年的寳貴時間，雖則已經過去，但我們決不要以爲成就少而減退前進的精神，放在我們前面的還有許多年頭等待我們去努力。</p>
<p>說得近一點，還是讓我們趕快擬定今後一年的計劃吧。</p>
<h3>英美工業的印象</h3>
<p>— 鄧紹裘譯自「遠東經濟學者」十二期</p>
<p>（一）旅行的印像</p>
<p>還記得很久了（一九三〇年和一九三三年）我到渦兩次英國，而在去年（一九四四年）我又到過美國，這三次的遊縣雖然是很短促的，但是都給我留下不少的印象，而今年我又很悻運地接運的到過英國，又到炎國作了二次很滿足舒暢的旅行，而我又得到了不少新的見識，很値得向讀者報吿的，這里是一些關於英美二國工業的，也可以當作許多世界改進工業的參考。</p>
<p>（二）英國的工業</p>
<p>我在英國旅行，還是對德戰爭的末期結束不久和對日勝利之間的五個月，那時候英國的工業是正由戰時的生產而回復到平時的生產，所以在戰時，英國那許多的棉紗織工廠而改爲生產軍火兵器，以及其他自行車，汽車工廠都是如此，當然現在一旦要回復原來的狀况，不但需要金錢，還需要更長的時間，人力，但是英國的工業是却於我，人們意料中的回復得快極了快極了。</p>
<p>英國的工廠的工作條件是大加改進了，這也是由於戰爭的需要而促成的，但是英國的工廠工作的地方是佈置得很完全的，淸潔，光亮，而且座位也是相當的舒服，再在工作的地點都裝有無綫電收音機，這樣在工作時叫工人可以聽到和諧的音樂所以說來英國工人的工作效率是　高，以棉紗來說，一個女工就可以照管二百二十個到三百個的紗綻的機器六部而在印度呢，是只有兩部，所以英國工業和其他國家的不同一就是他有這一個特點，工作效率高。</p>
<p>再說戰爭對於英國的工業是很有益的，許多工廠爲了戰爭的迫切需要，裝置了許多最　備新式的機械設備，同時，政府的資助，內部的擴火以及五年間成立了許多新的工廠，當然，這些廠的效率都是很高的，因此便促進了英國的平時工業的發展，但是也有些工廠爲了急需擴大範圍，設備匆匆聞也欠完備，也有些工廠缺少資本，因之也無法與效率高的工廠競爭，日久，也就有倒閉的危險了。</p>
<p>（三）美國的工業</p>
<p>假使單以工作效率來說，美國的工業是更勝過英國的工業，雖然英國的工作效率已是較其他國家高出許多了，但是美國工廠設備更爲完善，而且一般的工人旣善用又愛惜機器，而且美國的工人們也並不會因廠方的大量生產而要求增加工資，更不會担憂生產增加了而促成他們的失業。</p>
<p>美國人是關於優越的組織能方，他們對每一件事都是有計劃的，就如工廠的管理人員是竭力帮助工人，而在英國人看來，美國的工人是太缺少創造的能力，且美國高級工人的工作效率是並不高於英國，但是要知道，百分之九十九的美國任何工人都是富有一種進取的精神，這就是不可抹煞的供獻。</p>
<p>再說美國工作的一切條件也比英國好，工資也高，美國工人拿二元的工資，而英國工人却祗有一元，而且美國的工人還可以時常拿到物資的配給。這是因爲美國的單位生產成本低于英國，而且其是採用大規模的生產，英國則採用分工生產，所以美國工人的生活程度就比英國爲高，高于世界各國的工人生活程度。</p>
<p>在一九三九年至一九四四年之間，美國政府曾用去四十萬萬的美金來裝配工業。添置設備，改變計劃，他們自信可以同任何一個國家相競爭，準備提高出口量百分之五十，好在美國政府和工業家又看出了工業建設或的必</p>
<p>（四）兩國工業的硏究</p>
<p>最後說到英美兩國的工業硏究，當然是很有成就的，英國的愛細愛工廠請了一千五百位的化學家作試騐分析研究等工作，美國的工廠也寗願化百萬的美金來作硏究工作，而戰後，硏究人員是更增加了，硏究費也直綫形的增加着。</p>
<p>常然誰都可知道，戰後世界的經濟競爭是要比戰時戰前更加劇烈，那一個國家不想在國際上佔一個領導的地位，那末工業落後的國家，若再不急起直進，那就得受人支配，工作動率提高，工業硏究加强，這才是最有組織有計劃的工業建設。</p>
<h3>楊樹勳博士談　中國製藥業的前途</h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>硏究重於販賣　前途相當光明</p>
<p>主持楊氏化學治療所的楊樹勳博士，會留美獲得芝加哥大學化學博士學位，畢業後並由洛氏醫學硏究院聘爲硏究員，專門從事研究的工作，北平協和醫學院已曾慕名而請他回國服務，最後由中央研究院聘爲硏究員。</p>
<p>他是一向專心於研究工作的，因爲他覺得一個製藥事業，決不能缺少硏究室的設備，甚至一個樂廠的成敗，也可以隨着硏究室的情形而定奪，沒有硏究室，等於沒有了一個主宰。</p>
<p>他以爲這次勝利之後，有不少的舶來品的藥品，可以從事硏究。製造·代替，在當初他製造「新惜花散」的時候，曾經實行市塲調査，當時拜耳藥廠的新六〇六，在中國全年的營業是一百萬元，法國的九一四，全年的營業大的三四十萬元，日本藥也有二三十萬元，後來「新惜花散」問世，果然使他們受到相當的影響。</p>
<p>楊傳士因此就接着發明了「胰島萌」（因蘇林）等產效藥，以至於最近的「消發平痛」都是足以替代舶來品。</p>
<p>以前當楊博士供職於中央研究院的時候，曾經擬具了一個政府與人民合作的辦法，就是由中央研究院成立一個製藥部，專門担任硏究的工作，把硏究的結果，和某一種藥品的製造方案，交給民間的藥廠，而由中央硏究院在營業額裏抽取規定的佣金，這樣中央硏究院可以有一種收入來維持硏究的工作，民間的藥廠，也可以隨時得到新的製藥方案，可惜祇成立了半年，因戰事爆發而無形停止了。</p>
<p>據楊博士的目光看來，中國製藥業的前途是相當光明的，祇要注重硏究的工作。</p>
<h3>嘉樂紙廠巡禮</h3>
<p>— 宋誠</p>
<p>在一切生產事業落後的我國，造紙工業同樣地不能例外，所以抗戰以前的紙，大半都要仰給於國外——尤其是四川。直至民國十七年，李劼人先生由法國留學歸來，在不被人熟悉的川西一角設立了一個値得被人注意的生產機構，那就是嘉樂紙的誕生地——嘉樂紙廠。據說當時李先生創辦嘉樂紙廠，起先祗是一種試探，一種冒險，爲的是他想利用樂山（又名嘉定，位於岷江與靑衣江會合處。）每年生產十餘萬担的稻草來造紙，結果終於被他試騐成功了，「嘉樂紙」也因此開始與國人相見，不過，紙雖造出來了，然而銷路却成了問題—不是大打折扣，便是無人問津，當時李劼人先生爲了解決紙的銷路，就在成都設法開辦了「力報館」，每日所需的紙張全部採用嘉樂紙。這樣一來，嘉樂紙雖有了出路，却影響了報紙的銷路—因爲競爭不渦常將白報紙印刷的報紙是無疑的。但是李先生並沒有灰心，還是照着他的計劃和希望繼續不斷地苦撑着。</p>
<p>抗戰開始後，交通隨之阻塞，戰前可以採用舶來紙的，也不得不用嘉樂紙來替代了，因此在抗戰時期內，大後方造紙业的陣地裘，李先生終於建立了一座堅强的寳座，而「嘉樂紙」的名字在後方已是盡人皆知的了。在勝利前，嘉樂紙廠的嘉樂紙全由經濟都統銷或配給各機關團體，所以銷路遍及後方各大都市，如重慶，成都，昆明，西安它都设立有辦事處。</p>
<p>嘉乐紙廠，設立在西川樂山嘉樂門外徐家　，日前筆者帶着愉快的心情參觀該廠，據該廠業務主任曹鑑君談，全廠面積的佔地卅九畝，當筆者參觀時，「軋，軋，軋……」的機器聲，打破了周圍的寂靜，他們現在已有三架造紙機，其中一架是去年由經濟部撥給，一架是該廠開辦時購置的，現因年久，功效已大减，所以也不常用它，另一架是在民國卅年添置的，是工作比較最吃重的一架機器，製造嘉樂紙的原料是稻草，該廠每月的需四十五萬至五十萬市斤。造紙時，先將稻草和其他的材料放进蒸球內，再加藥品，如曹達之類，放入蒸氣，以蒸壓至八十磅煮之，等到蒸球內原料煮熟，即取出放入打漿機，打至織維極細時，再進入儲漿池，以加入「塡料」之用，紙浆由儲漿池經調怖器流入沉沙灘盤，沉去紙漿中的細砂及　物，然後進入造紙機，先經過造紙機內的銅絲布作成的圓網，被它帶出敷在造紙機的毛布滾軸上，再由毛布帶入壓榨機，使吸去過最的水份，並使紙漿碾壓緊密和熨貼，再由毛布带上烘缸，烘缸係一圓鋼板作成的平滑滾軸，通入高度的熱蒸氣，紙漿經過烘缸的高熱，使水份完全烘乾了，嘉樂紙就在另外一個輾軸上轉動着，據悉從稻草製成嘉樂紙，全部的過程祇須八小時。如果由棉花，破布及蔴織品等代替稻草，即可造出上白的道林紙，該廠因爲道　纸的成本和銷塲均有問題，所以　時仍以製造嘉樂紙供應內地各用户。但是最近聽說該廠將與永利化學工業社合作，在東川附近籌辦一規模較大的造紙廠。但願這個是事實，那四川造紙工業將更发達和健全是無疑的了。</p>
<p>現在樂山的嘉樂紙廠廠長一職是由陳曉嵐氏祖任，現有職工四百餘人，大多數工友已與廠方有着很深的關係，所以勞資雙方頗爲融洽，採三班輪流工作制，每班八小時。廠內設有員工消費合作社及理髮室醫務處等設備，專門爲生產事業流汗的工友們服務。</p>
<h3>工商管理的概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>丁，工作的督促</p>
<p>在製造工作的進行之中，是需要隨時的督促的，這督促工作，可以分爲兩種：</p>
<p>A.工作進行時的督促，</p>
<p>B.貨品製成過程中的檢査，</p>
<p>關於第一種工作，是很容易明白的，譬如我們建造一所房屋，我們一定要請一個監工，請他去監視工作的進行，他的責任是去免除工人的偸懶，和營造廠的偸工减料，</p>
<p>關於這一方面，可以有兩種方法：</p>
<p>第一種方法，是用我們的眼睛去做監視的工作，在製造廠裏的工頭，就是負滬種工作的人，他要看工人在工作時間之內，是否偸懶，或是否工作得不合樑準，如果發現，立即糾正，使不要繼續錯誤下去，第二種方法，是用記錄的方法，譬如說要考勤，每一個工人，有一張卡片，在上工的時候，就在計時鐘上去打一個時間，下工的的時候也是如此，又如每天所生產的工作，都有記錄，這一個方法，不但可以使一部的主任，看到工人的成績，經過統計的工作，可以使一個公司的當局也可以看到廠務的進行狀態，譬如我們辦理一個農塲，有着幾萬頭牛，那末每一頭牛，有一個號碼，每天出牛奶多少可以有一個統計，一僩牛奶公司的主人，正可以不入牛塲一而知道牛的一切—牠們的產量，牠們的健康，牠們的消耗。</p>
<p>做一個公司的當同，事實上不允許他一天到晚到各處去視察，所以記錄和統計的方法，是最能够供應他的需要的，</p>
<p>通常上述兩種工作是同時並進的。</p>
<p>關於貨品的檢査，那末對於貨品前途的影響很大，非要認眞辦理不可，我曾參觀過奇異安迪生燈泡廠，他們製成每一個步驟，都要經過檢査，在包裝妥善出廠之前，還要抽出幾隻，加以檢查，看看是不是合乎標準，又如藥廠，藥品出廠之前，也要經過許多次的檢査，允其是製造注射用的藥物，有許多藥廠，爲求愼重並劃淸負責起見，凡是負責檢査的人，在附在藥盒中的一張紙條上，都要簽名蓋章。</p>
<p>再以編書出版而論，做校對工作，也等於是一種檢査工作——檢査有沒有錯誤，商務世界等書局曾有一時把校對人的姓名也附載在版權頁上，這個舉動，也就是表示愼重的意思。</p>

<h3>九九週年紀念　敬慰全國作家</h3>
<p>九九勝利受降，到今天是整整一週年了。</p>
<p>在這一年之前，文藝界的作家們，無論在前方，後方，敵後，海外，憑着我們僅有的一枝筆桿，在一個目標之下，已經供獻了我們所能供獻的精力和青春，竭盡了我們應該盡的責任。我們吶喊，我們戰鬥，我們撐持，我們苦熬，我們受盡苦難與折磨，然而我們終於勝利了！</p>
<p>雖然，筆桿不是槍桿，但是紙彈有時却勝過砲彈。這些年，雖也不免有些沉滓，隨着戰爭的洪流泛起，背叛了抗戰陣營，然而時代的齒輪，早把文藝界的沉滓揚棄。而更有許多忠勇的作家，不幸的倫於殘廢，失掉健康，甚至於盡完了他的責任而悄然逝去。</p>
<p>現在我們站在勝利紀念碑前，我們可以由慰，也可以自傲，我們已經可以對得起我們的祖先，也可以對得起我們的後代。</p>
<p>在這一年來，作家已陸續復員，只是因為交通工具與運輸管理的缺限，甚至於到今天還有少數作家還留在後方，有許多作家雖已還都，旅途辛苦，却等於又逃了一次難。再回憶起我們的戰時生活，誰還能責難作家不能產生偉大作品呢？</p>
<p>本來戰後的艱苦，早在預料之中，現在這艱苦的第一年已經過去了，在這一年後，剩餘的有限的艱苦正等待偉大的人力來克服。人類精神技師的作家站在文藝事業的崗位上，當然不願放棄這一重新時代的課題，指導社會，善誘國民朝向永久的和平，光明的世界前進！</p>
<p>在今天緬懷往事，瞻望將來，更懷念着許多為衣食，為家累，為復員的運輸，或歸來以後的住所和職業等問題而掙扎的朋友們，以及已經殉難的朋友們的遺族的生活，更覺感慨萬千！然而，雖有萬千語言，也便無從說起。</p>
<p>於此謹以熱沈，敬致勝利的慰念和祝福！（編者）</p>
<h3>愛與死</h3>
<p>— 法·莫泊桑作　施星火譯</p>
<p>在這墓地上，站滿了軍官，正像一片開遍了花朵的田野。法國式的平頂帽和紅褲子，鑲條和金鈕子，參謀的肩章，衛士與騎兵們的絲帶，……在墓與墓之間穿梭似地來去，墓上的十字架，向着逝者展開他們悼念的臂膀。</p>
<p>雷蒙新上校的妻子剛下葬，她在兩天之前西游泳而溺斃，葬儀已經告終，僧侶們都離開了，那上校被兩位同僚支特着，還是站在墓穴前面，在穴底，他還能看到那橡木的棺槨，里面躺着他青年的妻子。</p>
<p>他是一個瘦長的老者，留着白色的短髪，三年以前，他跟一個已故的同伴蘇蒂斯上校遺下來的女兒結了婚。</p>
<p>司令官和副將催促着他回去，可是他抗拒着，用力擒住盈眶的熱淚，低聲地說着：「不，不！再等一會兒！」他固執着不肯走，在墓穴旁邊，他屈着雙膝，望着那無底的深淵，就在這無底的深淵里面，埋藏着他的心，他的生命和他所愛的一切。</p>
<p>突然地，亞蒙脫將軍抓住了雷蒙新的臂膀，幾乎用着力把他拖開來，說着：「來，來！老朋友！走吧！」</p>
<p>於是，上校依着，回到隊部里去。當他打開了書房門，拿起桌上的一封信來看時，他幾乎驚異和激動得跌了下去，他認得出這是他妻子的筆跡，信上的郵戳和日期是相同的，他急忙拆開信封來讀着：</p>
<p>「爸爸！容許我再一次叫你爸爸，跟過去的日子一樣；當你找到這封信時，我一定死了，而且已經入土了，因此，也許你會原諒我。</p>
<p>「我不想激起你的憐憫，也不想減輕我的罪惡，我只要告訴你全部的真實，用着一個在一小時之內就將去自殺的女人所有的誠挈的心倩。</p>
<p>「當你慷慨地跟我結合的時候，我為了感恩圖報就把自己給了你，我用着整個的少女的心靈來愛你，我愛你正像憂我自己的爸爸一樣——簡直完全一樣；記得有一天，當我坐在你膝上，你吻着我的當兒，我不由自主地叫你一聲「爸爸」，這呼喊完全出自內心，完全由於本能，真的，你對於我是一個爸爸，而不是別的。當時，你笑着對我說：「儘管這樣叫我吧，我的孩子，這樣再歡喜」。</p>
<p>「我們到了城里，——原諒我，爸爸——我墮入了愛網，呵！我長期地抗拒着外來的誘惑，將近兩年，可是，後來，我屈服了，我犯罪了，我要成了一個墮落的女人。</p>
<p>「至於他，你永遠猜不出他是誰，反正我是容易滿足的，因為有一打的軍官經常地圍繞着我，就是你所稱的十二個衛星羣。</p>
<p>「爸爸，不要去追尋他，也不要憎恨他，他只做了任何一個男人所要做的事情，同時我相信他也是全心全意地愛着我的。</p>
<p>「一天，我們有一個約會，在那磨坊旁邊的一個名叫碧西磯的小島上面，我必得游泳過去，他在叢林裏等着我，當我剛從樹枝縫裏瞥見他的，我們看到了你的勤務兵菲利浦，他使我們大驚失色，於是，組—我的愛人—對我說：「去，趕快游回去，我愛，留下我和這個人在這裏！」</p>
<p>我游得這樣倉皇，以致幾乎把自己溺死，當我回來之後，預感着將有可怖的事會發生。</p>
<p>「一個鐘頭之後，菲利浦在走廊裏遇到我時，低聲地說：「我正聽候夫人的命令，如果要帶什麼信的話，」然後，我知道他已被我的愛人買服了。</p>
<p>「我交給他幾封信，他帶了去，又拿了回信來。</p>
<p>「這樣過了兩個月光景，我們已跟你一樣地信任着他了。</p>
<p>「可是，爸爸，事情終於發生啦：有一天，在同一小島上面，我發現了你的勸務兵，他在等着我，他告訴我，要是我不答允他的要求，他將要向你告發一切</p>
<p>「啊，爸爸！爸爸！恐怖和懦怯征服了我，我想着：你待我這樣好，而我竟背叛了你，我又想着他，恐怕你會殺死他，也會殺死我，我瘋了，我想再一次買服為討厭的傢伙。——多麼可恥呵！</p>
<p>「我們女人是這樣的懦弱，我捫很容易失去理智。當一個女人墮落了一次，他就會接着墮落下去，一直墮落到底。我不知道為什麼要這樣做，只是想着你們兩人中間的一個和我自己將要死去——於是，我就把自己給了那禽獸。</p>
<p>「你知道，爸爸！我不會原諒我自己，以後的事是想像得到的，他會用着恐嚇手段，一而再，再而三地佔有着我，這是多麼可僧的事！這是多麼嚴重的懲罰，爸爸？</p>
<p>「這樣想着，什麼都完了，我一定要死去，当我活着，我不能向你悔罪，死了，我就有勇氣担承一切，除了死之外，我不能用別的方法來湔雪我自己，我是太被污辱了，我不能再愛也不配再被愛，我所接觸到的一切，像是都會被污辱似的。</p>
<p>「此刻，我要去洗澡，並且永遠不再回來了，這封信將由我」的愛人轉給你，帶着我最後的禱祝，你將要讀到她，當你從墓地上回來的時候。</p>
<p>「再會了，爸！我沒有別的話可以告訴你，隨便你怎樣做，只是要原諒我！」</p>
<p>上校擦乾了前額上的汗珠，恢復了在戰場上時的冷靜，他按了一下鈴。</p>
<p>一個僕人走進來。</p>
<p>「把菲利浦喊來！」上校說着，打開了抽屜。</p>
<p>那人立刻進來了——一個高大的兵士，留着紅色的鬍髭，一雙狡黠的鷹眼，作着不懷好意的注視。</p>
<p>上校直盯着他的臉</p>
<p>「快告訴我，我妻子的愛人的名字！」</p>
<p>「可是，上校——」</p>
<p>那軍官從半開的抽屜裏把手槍攫了出來。</p>
<p>「來，快，我不是跟你開玩笑！」</p>
<p>「好，——我的上校——那是司令官聖，亞爾伯脫。」</p>
<p>這名字還沒有說完，一片火光在他兩眼間一閃，他的前額已被一顆子彈貫穿了。</p>
<h3>顯尼志勞</h3>
<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>耶左爾。顧尼志勞（Arthur　Schnitzler）在一八六二年五月十五日生於　京維也納。他是一個喉科醫生的兒子，帶着猶太人的血統。一八八五年他在維也納大學畢業，得到醫學博士學位。就在大學病院裏實習了二三年，出院後，開始行醫，繼續做了十來年。他於醫務之暇，常寫些小說和戲曲。後來率性拋棄了醫生的職業，專事寫作。一九三一年十月二十一日因患心臟病逝世。</p>
<p>使他初次出名於文壇的是婀娜托爾（Anatole）戲媚（Liebelei）和循環舞（Der　Reigen）三劇。都是描寫維也納上等人的生活的。顯氏著作的題材大都取於當時的維也納社會，尤其是在自己底環境裏搜求的。主人公不是他自己，就是周圍的文士，一批淡泊的憂鬱家。差不多所有的著作都是如此：一個情人與一二個女人。描寫她們的愛情，則有幽雅的風緻，寫述各人的品格，都有一個身分。無論戲劇或小說，他所描寫的無論是軍官，醫生音樂家，村姑，或是寡婦，總用科學者的態度和紳士般的文雅來精細地分析心理的。顯氏對於人生是含有不知不測的命運之恐怖與懷疑。他以為人生在世是一種輕薄的游戲。在人生的全部，可以得到強烈的剎那間之享樂，然而終是淡的歡樂與薄的哀愁。所以他著作中的基調不外戀愛與死這二種東西。他便用憂鬱的，朦朧的情緒來描寫這種人生底活劇。</p>
<p>顯尼志勞雖然是屬於新浪漫主義的一派，但他已經把這派的藝術，漸漸拓到寫實方而去了；這因為他有一個與現實世界接近的科學的頭腦之故。他的藝術和霍夫曼斯達爾（Hon　Apffmannsthal）底藝術一樣的高超。尤其在技巧的精練和純化這一點上，酷似法國的大作家。但是他底作品是普遍的，能够使一般民眾和藝術界都賞鑑。這一點，是他和別的新浪漫主義的作家不同的地方，也就是他的偉大處。</p>
<p>顯氏所著劇本的精神與蘇德曼（Sudermann）和霍普特曼（Hauptmann）是絕不相同的；他雖然沒有霍普特曼的力，但是他具有典雅，精緻和溫和。還有他的諷刺，令人想起身為醫生的柴霍甫來。他底最優的戲曲有着誠實和哀歌風的悲哀，和精神底蟲惑力的結合。他底小說，實在可以用同樣的話來說明，那是以音樂的文體，流利的筆調寫出來的。他把這些極少的事實，巧妙地表現出來，却不嫌重複與厭倦。好像一個彈琴的高手，琴弦雖只有幾條，而經過他的撥彈，發出高低抑揚的琴音，變化無窮。這種高超的藝術手段實在令人欽佩。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風　27</p>
<p>「我想起一件事，鬼子的「失蹤」滑稽，表演得正好，怎麼……」</p>
<p>「怎麼失了蹤又歸了隊……而且馬上把消息傳佈出來？」我接上了他七七事件，兵士失蹤忽又歸隊的問題，「這一點，您就可以看出鶴見的工作，如何努力，如何爽利—事前，我們當然有情報，那個失蹤的小鬼後面，就有我們兩個隊員釘住，您知道他預備　到什麼所在去？……</p>
<p>「……一W君看見我忍不住要笑，也搖搖頭要笑。</p>
<p>「離豐台不遠，一家馬浪蕩的爛窰姐那裏，隨身還帶了一大瓶犒賞的正宗酒……」</p>
<p>「渾蛋，……只要死吃白賴，硬說失蹤一名或兩名兵士，誰去管他？何必定要實　的表演呢？」W君搖着頭，同時咬牙切齒的要駡下去，而又不屬於駡的忍住了</p>
<p>「小鬼不就是小鬼，天下那兒還找得出再笨些的「猪玀？」……」我替W君把想說的說了。「後來我們的隊員把那傢伙抓住，逼着他給幾個中日機關打了三四個電話—非常缺德的一種佈置—否則就算強逼他歸了隊，小鬼要不賴個乾凈才怪呢！」</p>
<p>「可不」？W君恨恨地說，「就這樣，總算把矮鬼的東洋泡泡都戳破了，可他仍舊要「強硬圓滑，」的進行咧」。這「強硬圓滑」四字，是白寇秘密命令上所用的辭句，是我們前幾天轉告給W君北平總站的情報。</p>
<p>北平城以內的治安，仿是我方警衛隊管制着，雖然日本的爪牙；就如高麗棒子，浪人，破落戶的匪類，有些張牙舞爪，　然思動，但也不過城狐社鼠式的暗中搗鬼而已。</p>
<p>我們的車子，倒也一路平安，達到了目的地—北京飯店。</p>
<p>「老伯來了」？小老虎迎了上來，又冲着W君行了一鞠躬的大禮，轉身引路。</p>
<p>「紀姨」，小老虎開了門，對屋子裏說，「兩位……一位是　老伯，一位是……是……」他沒法稱呼。</p>
<p>「紀小姐，對不起得很……」我跨進屋子告歉。</p>
<p>「兩位先生請坐」。東北小姐竟是大方坦白的很。</p>
<p>我很佩服鶴見的眼光。她確實一位傑出人才—應我的眼光看。我記得有一位哲人，寫過這麼兩句話：「你的眼目顯出你的靈性，言語代表你的思想，行動說明你的品格，精神表白你的資質，神氣流露你的學識。……」大概就是這些條件的總和表現，說明了她是一位傑出人才。</p>
<p>同時，我也明暸鶴見為什麼不願見她，那就是說，祇要鶴見不是一個偽道學之流。像一般有眼力的青年，見了這樣的一位小姐，恐怕就要把求得她的戀愛，當作終身最大的事業了；因為她固然有一種咄咄逼人的英勇氣概，同時也有一種叫人傾倒於不覺的風度，倒不是美與不美的問題。</p>

<h3>榮案贓款</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>榮家已經派人把這筆從綁匪追回的贓款領回去了，其實際數目如下：</p>
<p>美金　九萬四千七百四十五元</p>
<p>法幣　一億零二百七十一萬五千二百元</p>
<p>黃金　三百卅二兩九錢二分八厘</p>
<p>美金以三三五〇折合法幣計三億一千七百三十九萬五千七百五十元，黃金以每兩二十二萬一千元折合法幣計七千三百五十七萬七千零八十八元，三項合計四億九千餘萬元。</p>
<p>就是這樣，為數也可觀了。</p>
<p>對於這筆款子的處置，有人主張撥作警察福利基金，有人主張救濟蘇北難民，而我們也曾主張過設立「德生助學金」，資助失學青年；可是到今天為止，榮德生先生本人，或榮家，迄未有一點明白而具體的表示，實在是令人懸系的一件事！</p>
<p>並非這些人見財起意，看不得這筆錢，老實說，上海灘，有錢的人多的是，榮府也不是首屈一指，不過此時此地而有此事，誰提出一種主張來，誰都是為了公眾也為了榮先生。</p>
<p>錢是好東西，能利人，也能害人，問題在如何使用了。讀過洛克斐勒（煤油大王）自傳的人，便能體會到他那種「錢多是煩惱」的說法，也許有若干人還以為他特地聘請一批專家組織一個基金會，成天研究如何用錢是發痴的哩！可是，我們得承認他的兩句話是真理：</p>
<p>「上帝讓我有這麼多錢，祇是在讓我好好利用它。」</p>
<h3>甜蜜的睡眠</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>記者節前夕，本市衛生局張局長曾參加記者聚餐會，張氏以衛生學者的資格，勸告各報記者應該每天實行午睡，使精神得有調劑。可見睡眠對於人類健康的重要。</p>
<p>睡眠是生理的要求，日常體力的消耗，身心的疲勞都要賴睡眠才能補償和恢復。大抵愈是高等的動物，每日所需的睡眠時間也愈多；低於哺乳類的動物，不但睡眠時刻較少，而且起臥動靜從無一定時刻。</p>
<p>在習慣上說，人類平均每日所需睡眠時間為八小時，但是根據德國學者與芝加哥大學教授先後實騐所得，認為八小時的睡眠，未免浪費光陰，原來睡眠竟是「重質不重量」的，八小時的「淺睡」，還抵不上六小時的「酣睡」。</p>
<p>愛爾蘭有一位老麵包師，在一九三六年去世，他生時養成一種習慣：晚上八點鐘開始烘麵包，一直烘到天明五六點鐘，太陽出來，他便上山打獵，有一時期，他平均每星期祗睡眼七八小時，但是身體，亳無影響。</p>
<p>猿猴猩猩之類，每天睡眠和人類相等，但是象，每天祇需要三四小時的睡眠。</p>
<p>睡的時侯，腦的活動减低，人體的血液集中在心臟腸胃等部位，可以增進消化器官的功能，所以在夏天，午睡是最需要的。目前，各文明國家的軍隊和公共機關，每逢夏天，必定實行集團午睡。</p>
<p>張局長建議飯後午睡，實在是值得提倡的。</p>
<p>偶感雜談</p>
<h3>鬍子</h3>
<p>— 徐洪福</p>
<p>談鬍子足以顯示一國的國民性。歐美人雖年近耳順，下半個臉永遠是塊不毛之地，他們永遠是年青的。印度人尚未成人，鬈鬚便早似螺螄般釘黑了半截臉龐，這十足的表現出他們的老大。</p>
<p>鬍子足以揚名保身，名聞遐邇的梅蘭芳博士為了表示拒絕給敵偽演唱的決心，就留上了唇髭，獲得了全國上下的贊許，「誰說藝人無骨氣呢！」他的聲名是更紅了。三國時的曹操，被馬超追得急了的時候，要不時情急智生的來一下截袍斬鬍，怕不早作了刀下之鬼？</p>
<p>鬍子十足地表示出人心的矛盾。孩子看見鏡子裏的自己，鼻孔下沒有像父親那樣地長着一撮黑毛，便會用毛筆醮墨來塗上二撇，以此誇耀於小朋友之前。年紀到了出鬍鬚的時候，便又會覺得這是討人厭的，會不怕流血疼痛，執了豬毛鑷子，死命地耐心地連根帶肉地拔個精光。</p>
<p>鬍子在漫畫中佔着極重要的位置，唇上一攝小鬍于，我們就以刻猜到，不是滑稽家卓別林，定是獨裁者希特拉了。仁丹式的　　上翹的八字鬍，那無疑是日本的軍政大員。至於高爾基，史太林的俄國式鬍子，更易辨認，它像兩把去柄的　帚，分懸在高鼻管下。</p>
<p>鬍子曾作過賭押，去年緬甸　　，十四航空隊的美籍隊員，　發誓不完成任務，決不薙鬍。　和「翦滅匈奴，然後朝食。」　相媲美。</p>
<p>鬍子跟別種生理特徵一般地可給人造成綽號。如浙東之虎的田岫山，就叫田鬍子。阿Q正傳的王「癩」鬍，也就因為他有鬆蓬蓬的鬍子。</p>

<h3>裴斐教授的話</h3>
<p>— 馬超常</p>
<p>中國人還有兩點沒有變</p>
<p>本月四日下午三時，某校邀了美國哥侖比亞大學教授裴斐博士，首次至我們校內演講，在我們的熱烈的鼓掌中，他是顯現在我們的眼前開講了；在他的講詞中，首先他說：「以前外國人常常批評中國人的思想行動是永遠不會變的，可是現在見到中國人一切都變過了，比以前是進步的多了，不過還有二點沒有變去，第一點沒有變的，就是中國人見了外國人老是這麼客氣，令我們覺得太客氣了。第二點沒有變的，中國人總喜歡聽取外國人的建譏。……」</p>
<p>我們聽了他這一段，在他的講詞中似乎是客串笑話而已，可是我們若將這一段言語細細的體味起來，却有無盡感想！</p>
<h3>低·調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>南京路，風塵中的女子。</p>
<p>南京路好比一個風塵中的女子，在戰前尚是一個「細皮白肉」的好女子，經過八年的蹂躪，變得「形銷骨立」，風姿全失。想不到最近一年，更因體弱失調，直至今日竟弄得「千瘡百孔」，僅僅剩下一副「骷髏相」。</p>
<p>翻開報紙一看，舞弊之事，無日無之。如果剪裁下來，日積月累，倒可編一部「舞弊大全」。全國檢察官，似應人手一冊，對辦案不無帮助。</p>
<p>或謂「看見大月餅而能懷念蘇北災情者恐無其人」。此話不確，許許多多流浪在上海的蘇北人民，難道都已忘懷了可愛的故鄉嗎？</p>
<p>取締攤販，最大目的在防止助長碼頭竊風，有人提議：把所有攤販盡僱為緝私人員，則不特治標，且可治本。但是水上警備機構據說名目已有六種之多，不識當局能否准予「再事擴充」耳。</p>

<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>年青的主教　于斌</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>最近自東北歸來的于斌主教，是一般外國人心目中「中國最偉大的天主教徒」。他在抗戰期間努力海外宣傳及賑災工作，對祖國的勞績，確是不可磨減的。</p>
<p>榮歸老家東北，原是于主教的故鄕，當民國廿八年芝加哥華僑歡迎于氏會上，芝城大主教史林曾謂：『我深信「滿洲國」偽組織不久即成為歷史上的陳蹟，于主教即可榮歸「老家」。』七年後的今天，于主教果然榮歸老家了，但老家正打得鑼鼓喧天，「山河依舊，景物全非，」（于氏對記者語。）于主教也只能到達幼年賣書故地永吉，略事勾留，不能再北上抵達黑龍江上自己出生的家園，于氏心中，當不勝感慨與惆悵！</p>
<p>于氏字野聲，洗名保祿，黑龍江蘭西縣人。在江蘇省立第一師範畢業後，入震旦大學肄業，民國十三年赴羅馬進「宣傳信仰部大學」，連得哲學博土，神學博士，教律學博士三種學位。二十二年又得意大利國立大學政治學博士，任烏爾朋大學教授有年。同年冬被委任為中國全國公教進行會總監督，始回國就職。</p>
<p>一段佳話在歐洲時尚有一段佳話：于氏曾隨教延專使團赴非洲阿比西尼亞考察，得阿皇五星勛章，回到意國，又領到意王頒發的勳章。隔不多時意阿交惡，互成敵國，而于博士乃得兼有兩國勳章，在國際外交史上，增一美談。</p>
<p>民國二十二年冬，教皇諭擺令在江蘇教區內，劃出江寗，無錫等十五縣為南京教區，規定由華籍主教來管理，因為暫時物色不到適當的人，由惠濟良主教代理。直到二十五年，教廷再三慎重考慮，方決定令派于斌博士。終是這位只有三十六歲的年輕教徒，做了一百二十七教區中第二十三位華籍主教。</p>
<p>二十八年于氏出國，各國報章雜誌上競載于氏消息和演說，一時于氏成為四百多種報的中心人物，受各界教徒，僑胞等的熱烈歡迎。芝加哥的布敦市長曾以該市的金鎖匙一把相贈，坦示胸襟，以示歡迎。于主教在各國宣揚我國抗戰，募款賑災，不遺餘力。誠如他回國後在桂林接見記者時說：</p>
<p>「在一百多個名城中，我代表中國無告的平民，向世界人士呼籲，請求救濟，並且把我國抗戰英勇史實也告訴了他們，博得世界各國的援助與同情。</p>
<p>「一個天主教徒，他的工作，除了應盡國民的義務以外，還有二件事可做，第一件是救濟，第二件是國際宣傳。」</p>
<p>豐功偉績于氏到各國宣傳援華救災。在舊曆元旦日，紐約僑胞在于氏主特下，舉行「救護車百輛運動大會」，參加游行者達萬餘人，在四小時內，立即募得美金二萬餘元。于氏又在歐洲發行「中國通訊」，刋載我國抗戰文獻，各大報的社評，和後方建設消息，實為我國海外通訊社的嚆矢，在紐約發行「英文中國月報」，初印三萬份，即銷售一空，加拿大，南美各國，都紛紛訂閱。</p>
<p>于氏身體頎長，聲音洪亮，善於演說。在美國六星期中，共演設三百三十次。「蒙脫來城復興報」形容他的演說道：「出言莊重而準確，毫無虛飾，尤其難能可貴的，是他的博愛精神，雖在指責敵人暴行的時候，也毫無仇恨的態度。」</p>
<p>我雖非天主教徒，對于主教此種精神，不禁致崇高的敬意！</p>

<h3>九九勝利紀念特刊　勝利一年來　國際政治的波瀾</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>（戰勝不易　和平更難）　自第二次世界大戰勝利結束後，已經一年有餘了。在這一年餘的歲月中，國際政治外交家，雖曾竭智盡能，致力於締造世界和平的工作，但是對於戰敗國的和平條約，迄今尚未簽字成立，使戰後的世界仍處於戰時狀態中，真正的和平，還沒有降臨世間。在今天回想起勝利一年來國際政治的演變，真使我們感喟萬千！</p>
<p>在德日相繼投降二次大戰勝利結束之際，全世界的人類，莫不歡欣欲狂，都以爲今後的世界，即可步入和平民主的新時代，共享太平世界的繁榮。詎意一年以來，國際政治的波瀾迭起，不但使大家掃興失望，而且使大家相信：「戰勝固然不易，締造和平更加困難。」其實有遠見的政治外交家，早巳料及，所以大戰之中，就有大西洋憲章的發表，舊金山會議的召開，其唯一的用意，也就是在不待戰爭結束，早爲戰後新世界的機構，打一個詳細精密的「圖樣」。尤其是英美蘇三巨頭在德國投降所舉行的波茨坦會議，可以視爲列強政治外交家致力和平的起點。所謂波茨坦宣言，包括兩種重要文獻，第一是中英美三國領袖共同簽署的對日無條件投降的宣言，第二是英美蘇三國巨頭髮表的對德宣言。關於後者，對於締造歐洲和平的貢獻殊多。最重要的有二點：</p>
<p>（甲）關於設立外長會議：</p>
<p>（一）召開中英美法蘇五國外長會議，繼續爲締造和平作一切必要的工作，並討論列強隨時所提出的其他問題。</p>
<p>（二）第一次外長會議定於九月一日在倫敦舉行。</p>
<p>（三）外長會議之當前任務，厥爲起草對美、芬、羅、匈、保五國和約，並對於歐戰結束時所有重要問題，提出解決辦法。呈請聯合國機構決定；</p>
<p>（乙）對於管制德國問題：</p>
<p>（一）履行克里米亞對德宣言所規定之辦法，以肅清德國軍國主義及納粹餘孽，今後並須採取其他必要步驟，俾能保證德國不復威脅鄰邦世界和平。</p>
<p>（二）澈底解除德國的武裝及其防務，並加緊家長制德國可作爲軍事生産之工業。</p>
<p>（三）準備依照民主基礎再造德國政治生活，並使德人在國際生活中和平合作。</p>
<p>（四）組織德國經濟，應置重點於發展農業與和平的國內工業。</p>
<p>（五）依照克里米亞會議之決定，德國對於聯合國所受之損失，應負賠償之責。</p>
<p>（六）關於領土問題，德國應將東普魯士之哥尼斯堡城及其附近地帶，割讓與蘇聯。</p>
<p>（五強會議　如期舉行）　在波茨坦會議結束之後，對日宣言，因爲有美國原子炸彈做它的後盾，終於奏效，而日本天皇於八月十五日向全國廣播無條件投降，使第二次世界大戰全部結束。自從德國於五月九日投降，到日本放下武器，時隔三月，因爲遠東的戰爭尚未終止，歐洲和和平工作，就無法展開，到日本投降，整個大戰完全終止之後，召開國際會議以收拾戰後歐洲的殘局，當然巳成爲刻不容緩的事了。所以中，英，美，法，蘇五國外長，便於九月十日在倫敦開幕。</p>
<p>從九月十一日到二十日，五國外長討論的主題，就是義大利問題，期中包括了下列各項問題：　義大利的繮界問題。不僅法國對義大利有領土要求，就是南斯拉夫對於義大利，也有領土要求。　義大利海軍處置問題，除了義國所應保留的，其餘的軍艦如何分配。　義大利的殖民地處置問題，英美對於　義屬東菲洲的殖民地，都有覬覬的野心。　義大利的賠款問題，蘇聯要求義國賠償一萬萬美元，希臘與南斯拉夫也要求義國賠款，討論十天的結果，只解決了兩項問題。（一）義南兩國在伊斯特里亞半島的繮界，以種族界綫爲依歸。（二）特里雅斯特港實行國際化。其餘的問題，都得不到解決。</p>
<p>從九月二十到廿五日外長會議討論巴爾干問題。英美與蘇聯的裂痕，更加露骨了。第一英美不承認羅，匈，保，奧四國的政府是民主政體，因此堅持非把政治民主化之後，不能與這四國締結和約，同時對於多瑙河的航行，又要求國際化，使蘇聯萬萬不能同意。在蘇聯的眼中看來，巴爾干半島是斯拉夫民族的天下，決不容許英美置喙的。因此，蘇聯外長菲洛托夫於九月二十二日提出一個驚人的建議，主張未簽字於停戰協定的國家，不得參加和約的起草工作，這個提議，匪特不容許我國參加歐洲和約的討論，而且也反對法國過問對羅，匈，保，芬四國的和約。英國外相貝文與美國國務卿貝爾納斯，雖極力反對，與菲洛托夫展開舌戰，但是徒費唇舌，無法改變蘇聯的態度。因此五國外長會議乃臨於僵局。</p>
<p>到十月二日，五國外長雖然仍欲挽回外長會議的厄運，但是終免未能打開歐洲問題的僵局，於是五國外長也就不歡而散了。</p>
<p>國際局勢　頓趨緊張</p>
<p>倫敦五國外長會議不歡而散之後，國際局勢陷於困境，加以原子炸彈的秘密問題，使英蘇兩國之間的關係，益趨惡化。在英美兩國方面而論，她們都表示，原子炸彈的秘密可以公開，也可以交國際管制；但是有一個條件，就是蘇聯應該宣佈其在政治上及領土上的野心，在蘇聯而言，英美這種態度和作風，不啻以原子炸彈來威脅蘇聯；因此雙方的誤會，愈演愈深，美國的報紙，甚麽有主張以原子炸彈轟炸莫斯科的。因此國際局勢緊張，使神經過敏的人，以爲第三次世界大戰就要爆發了。同時在中東，因爲伊朗問題，英蘇衝突日見尖銳化，也充滿了火藥氣味。在近東，土耳其海峽問題，因爲蘇聯的不肯放鬆一步，迭次要求與土國共同防衛海峽地帶；巴爾干半島巳成爲斯拉夫民族的天下，僅留一個希臘，而希臘國內又紊亂不堪，政府當局苟不得英國駐軍的支持，就有被推翻之虞。此在太平洋因爲荷印發生印度尼西亞運動，反抗荷蘭，如火如荼。</p>
<p>美國發動　與蘇妥協</p>
<p>一九四五年的下半報，國際局勢的緊張，有增無減；但是時局的癥結，乃在英美與蘇聯的積不相容，如欲緩和局勢，必須從改善英美與蘇聯的關係着手。美國國務卿貝爾納斯有鍳於斯，乃不惜向史太林低頭，首先示得美蘇的諒解。然後進一步，發起召開英，美，蘇三國外長會議，企圖以三國協調，打開目前的僵局。因此三國外長——貝爾納斯，貝文，莫洛托夫，便在莫斯科開會了。當時三國外長卻抱着「相忍爲和」的態度，對於任何國際問題，都願意退讓，不像在倫敦五國外長會議時那末強硬。所以三國外長會議開會未久，對於各項問題，就獲得了協定。據三國外長所發表的公報，可知道次會議的結果有：</p>
<p>（一）關於日本問題，將遠東顧問委員會改組爲遠東委員會。</p>
<p>（二）關於中國問題，三國外長重申不干涉中國內政的政策。</p>
<p>（三）關於朝鮮問題，三國外長同意將朝鮮並美蘇兩國託管，以五年爲期，美國在南部，蘇聯在北部。</p>
<p>（四）關於原子能問題，三國同意成立一委員會，以攷慮因原子能發明而産生的各種問題。</p>
<p>（五）對義，羅，匈，保，芬五國的和約起草問題：</p>
<p>（一）對義和約，由英，美，法，蘇四國外長起草；</p>
<p>（二）對羅，保，匈三國和約，由英，美，蘇，三國外長起草；</p>
<p>（三）對芬和約，由，英蘇兩國外長起草。</p>
<p>（六）召開廿一國和會問題，至和約草案完成時，由外長會議奉個會員議，邀請其他十七國，五行廿一國和會，以審　對美，羅，匈，保，芬五國和約草案。這個會議的舉行，不得遏於一九四六年五月一日。</p>
<p>國際景象　漸趨光明</p>
<p>三國外長會議的公報發表之後，美國國務卿貝爾納斯，即回到了華府，得意洋洋地報告莫斯科之行，獲得了重大的成就，國際上的戾氣，卻可以消滅於無形了，在和平的前面，展開了一幕美麗的遠景）不久一九四六年也展開了光榮的新買，聯合國大會也就在倫敦開幕，使各國的人民，都興奮萬分，大家以爲世界得救了，和平有希望了，英國外相貝文，向衆議院演說，他說「世界持久的和平，有賴於聯合國與英美蘇三強的密切合作」會獲得下議院調解員熱烈的鼓掌。</p>
<p>聯合國大會於今年一月十日在倫敦開幕，各國的政治家外交家，都在大會發表宏論，敘述各國對於世界和平的理想，都是動聽的，足以使人不復相信在列強之間，尚有利害衝突的地方；但到了第二階段的時候，這種實際問題都提出來討論，情形就完全不同了。各國代表的唇槍舌劍，一齊拿出來大顯神通了。尤其是在英蘇之間，爲了希臘問題，郵政車代表辨論到面紅耳赤，還不肯罷休。於是這一個虛無飄渺的遠景，也就幻滅了。</p>
<p>不過在聯合國大會於二月十日閉幕的時候，各國代表對於世界和平，還抱着若干信心，誠如英國首相文德禮致閉幕詞說：「聯合國機構現巳置於堅穩之基礎上，大會所討論的問題，期中如原子能秘密以及世界糧食恐慌問題等，均巳獲得初步解決。」大會主席，即比利時外長史巴克，得公平地說：「凡以爲吾人能完成奇蹟者，均將感失望；含量一瞭解戰爭所遺留之問題，唯有以聯合行動始能解決者，則將感滿足。」</p>
<p>聯合國大會第一次會議，即有如此成績，也不能表示不滿，但是聯合國機構能否成爲維持世界和平有效的機構，還要看今年九月廿三日開第二次會議時的情形而定呢！</p>
<p>美又發起　四強會議</p>
<p>國際局勢，並未因聯合國機構的　生而趨於緩和，到了本年四月間，反面有愈趨緊張之勢。一秉和平的初衷之美國國務卿貝爾納斯，爲使歐洲若干國家，尤其是義、羅、芬、保、匈五國，早日恢復正常狀態起見，乃於四月四日，分別照會英、法、蘇三國當局，對於四國外長次會議的工作遲滯表示遺憾，並主張四強外長應於四月廿五日集議於巴黎，以決定廿一國和會於五月一日以前。英法首先表示贊同，其後蘇聯也表示同意。於是英美法蘇四國外長於四月廿五日又在巴黎開會了。</p>
<p>從四月廿五日開始，到五月十六日休會，前後共開了二十二天的會議，雖不能說獲得重大的結果，但對於若干問題卻也有相當成績：</p>
<p>（一）討論對義和約問題，獲得協議的有1義國賠款問題，四國外長同意，義大利應賠償蘇聯一萬萬美元；2交國艦隊處置問題，除義國保留若干軍艦而外，其餘軍艦概由四強瓜分。希臘和南斯拉夫，也分得若干艘。3義大利繮界問題：義奧邊境問題，決定以南蒂羅爾省之上埃第其區歸義大利保留；法義邊境問題，派遣調查團前往實地勘察；義屬杜特喀尼斯羣島歸還希臘。4義大利舊有殖民地處置問題；英美法蘇四強的意見，蘇聯代表主張被告國際託管制，即將的黎波里泰尼亞歸義蘇兩國託管，塞萊尼加則交英義託管。討論的結果，只能採取不了了之的辦法，延宕幾年再談。</p>
<p>（二）特里惟斯特港問題：南斯拉夫要求義國將維尼齊亞基里亞區與特里雅斯特港，均應歸南國，蘇聯當表示同意；含量一是英美則表示反對，最後法國提出折衷辦法，特港實行國際化。</p>
<p>（三）巴爾干問題，四國外長決定，匈牙利應將外錫爾伐尼亞省羅國。羅保邊界不動。至於多腦河航行問題，英美主張交國際管制，蘇聯堅決反對，以致未能成立協議。</p>
<p>（四）對德奧問題，均曾提出討論，但未獲得協議。</p>
<p>四國外長會議開了廿一天的會議，早巳沒精打采，如果不休會一月，就要重蹈倫敦五國外長會議的覆轍。所以美國國務卿，貝爾納斯，見事不佳，乃提議休會一月，至六月十六日重開。於是巴黎第一次外長會議，也就草草了事。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3>如何紀念九九勝利</h3>
<p>— 馬超俊</p>
<p>今天是「九九」勝利週年紀念日。去年的今天，要征服我國的日本，到底也要向我國簽訂無條件投降的降書。這說明了，暴力不足恃，侵略者一定失敗。這也說明了，公理終必戰勝强權，人類已經從漫漫長夜逐漸走進光明之境。</p>
<p>由於勝利了一年，國內和國外一樣，大局還是動盪不安，和平還沒有得到切實的保障，許多人失望了，悲觀了。不過這個世界已經有幾百萬年的歷史，我們一生祇有幾十年，佔看世界的歷史實在不過一剎那。如果我們爲着人類在進化的過程一時受着一點頓挫，就表示失望與悲觀，那未免性子太急，也實在太近視了。國父昭示我們、人類的進化是由獸性而至人性，而至神性。現在人類還沒有完全脫離獸性，所以戰爭還是常常發生。不過根據人類進化的趨勢，人類總有一天完全脫離獸性，而至完全人性，更有一天進化到神性。</p>
<p>就拿這次大戰和上次大戰來比較，上次戰爭，戰勝國對於戰敗國採報復的態度，以寃報寃，所以戰爭循環不已，這次戰爭，戰勝國對戰敗國採改造的態度。以德報寃。消滅戰爭的根源，上决大戰結束後，各國組織一個國際聯盟，這次大戰結束後，各國組織一個聯合國，後一個機構對於戰爭的防止那就切實得多了。况且前一個機構美國置身局外，後一個機構美國不僅參加，更以全力又持。現在聯合國每次開會，爭執還是很多，可是世界的問題太複雜了，爭執是免不了的，我們看看美國的歷史，在獨立戰爭勝利後開始的時候，爭執也很厲害，後來大家忍耐地逐一解決，大家才和諧地合作起來。我們深信聯合國的爭執一定會慢慢地減少而至消滅，人類會慢慢地和諧的合作，共謀人類的幸福。聯合國在這短短的一年歷史中，已經解決不少爭執，可以證明這個推測的正確。</p>
<p>說到我們中國，這一次抗戰，可以說與辛亥革命有同樣的重要性，辛亥革命是要消滅奴役我們二百多年的滿淸，這决抗戰是要消滅存心奴役我們的日本。辛亥革命成功後所遭遇的困難，比較抗戰勝利後所遭遇的艱難多得多了，雖然辛亥革命沒有抗戰破壞那麽大，可是當時反革命的勢力還是佈滿全國，革命的力量實在微小得很。然而國父不顧一切艱難，毅然與反革命相搏鬥，打倒袁世凱稱帝於前，剷除張勳復辟於後。國父的議承人將主席更在絕大艱難困苦中，肅淸軍閥。我們中國現在的革命的情勢，比較民國初年，實在好得多了，人民的智識也提高了，再也不會受掛羊頭賣狗肉的政治野心家所欺騙了。我們深信一切革命的障礙物必然會肅淸，必然會像袁世凱和張勳之流，一樣的失敗。有些人對於抗戰旣未流過血，也未出過錢，出過力，現在抗戰勝利，倒要出來爭權奪利，簡直是民族的渣滓，無疑地一定會受大時代所淘汰。</p>
<p>這個世界在革命中，我們中國也在革命中。抗戰勝利，祗是革命過程中的一個段落，我們還得忍耐地繼續奮鬥。我們抗戰抱着長期抗戰的決心才獲得勝利，我們建國也要抱着長期建國的決心才會成功。辛亥革命的時候，大家幻想着，革命成功之後，中國馬上就會變爲富强康樂的國家，不肯繼續奮鬥，所以革命的成果給反革命者破壞無遺。我們這次抗戰，也有不少人幻想着，抗戰勝利之後，中國馬上就會變成富强康樂的國家。道也犯着辛亥革命後同樣的毛病，所以這一年來，許多人爲着幻想沒有實現，失望的失望，悲觀的悲觀，怨恨的怨恨。這實在是我們對於革命的過程認識不淸的原故。</p>
<p>去年的今天，全國瘋在地慶祝勝利。這是應該的。八年抗戰，勝利的獲得實在太不容易了。今年的今天，我們慶祝勝和，頭腦却要冷靜一點了。我們要正視現實，也要遠矚將來。我們要以抗戰的精神，完成建國的大業，我們對於世界的前途應該樂觀，對於中國的前途更應該樂觀。抗戰要經過千辛萬苦，才會勝利，建國也要經過千辛萬苦，才會成功。我們爲着八年來對於抗戰必勝的信心沒有發生動搖，所以抗戰獲得最後的勝利。我們對於建國必成的信心要始終如一，建國才會成功。這個世界以至中國，由惡劣的情勢變好，除却我們不斷的奮鬥之外，沒有別的奇蹟。在慶祝勝利的今天，我們要下最大的決心，準備喫盡各種苦頭，不惜犧牲一切，忍耐地建設一個新世界，建設一個新中國，才對得住陣亡將士和死難同胞，才對得住萬世的子孫。這個世界是在進步，中國也是在進步，任何人也阻止不了的。抗戰沒有死的人們，共同努力罷！</p>

<h3>麥帥在日本一年來偉績　灌輸新血　充實真空</h3>
<p>— 大春</p>
<p>美國的政治風已經吹到太平洋的西岸來了。有許多人在說，以太平洋盟軍最高統帥，出任佔領日本總督的麥克阿瑟將軍，也許將參加美國下届總統競選。上次大選，常麥師正在太平洋作戰的時候，就盛傳他將和已故羅斯福總統競選，結果麥帥否認了。</p>
<p>照東京消息靈通的人說：他要做總督。</p>
<p>一般觀察家說：他的希望在求「模範佔領」的實現，正如他稱讚他駐日軍隊爲「模範戰勝軍」一樣。</p>
<p>麥帥總部的發言人也曾說過：他仍以完成佔領日本的使命爲唯一任務。</p>
<p>不論他的政洽犬志究竟怎樣，這位聯合國最高統帥，自他執政一年來，對於他的工作，總是放出全副精神在幹。照他原定的計劃，一步一步的做，以期做到他認爲十全十美的佔領。挫折自然也有，可是他不灰心，他好像對於一切都早有準備似的。</p>
<p>苦幹精神</p>
<p>近來有許多謠傳；說麥帥以六十六歲的高齡，應付這繁重的責任，體力已經不繼，或有退休的意思；可是事實上，一年來，除了輕傷風外，他沒有病過，照他的醫生說，他身體極好，一點問題也沒有；而在工作方面，他還是和最初一樣的苦幹，每日工作十八小時。</p>
<p>他不但苦幹，而且喜歡他的工作；同時日本人民也多尊敬和愛護他。有許多人認爲麥帥是「解放者」，還有些人稱讚他爲「了不得」。</p>
<p>一年來，麥帥離開過日本一次，去參加菲律賓獨立的盛典；他一共頒布了三千份以上的指示給日本人民，他和日皇有過兩决秘密會議；在五月，有人企圖謀害過他的性命，不過他至今還是單獨出入，即使有隨從，也不是武裝的。</p>
<p>麥帥最愛他的妻子。他的兒子叫阿瑟，方八歲，已經能寫曲譜，一家三口住在美國大使館。</p>
<p>工作日程</p>
<p>麥帥每天的工作程序，大致是如此的：十一時以前離家，駛車往盟軍總部，逕赴六樓辦公室工作；一時半回家午餐。下午五時再辦公直到七時半或八時止，他一星期七天天天辦公，對於手下的雇員却規定一星期工作四十小時。</p>
<p>在盟軍總部門前，每天總有很多美國軍士，僑民，和日本人圍着，瞻仰麥帥丰采，爲他拍照。在麥帥就任之初，有一位副官曾下令禁止這班人圍聚，特別指定日人只准在對街站立，後來麥帥知道了，他立刻取消這條命令</p>
<p>最初麥帥對於美軍和日本人的交際，可以說是採取一種「聽其自然」的政策；後來雖然有幾種限制，但是大體上日美人民之間有來往之自由，因爲麥帥相信，雙方正當的接觸，可以帮助宣揚民主思想。</p>
<p>宣揚民主</p>
<p>宣揚民主本是麥帥處理戰後日本政策的主要目的。九月二日，在「勝利一週年」的文吿裏，麥帥說：</p>
<p>「……日本總潰敗的結果，不單是武力被推翻，國家吃敗仗，且是日本人民信仰悉瓦解，………無論在道德上，心理上，或表面上，日本已變成一個完全完全的眞空。而灌輸入這眞空的，正是民主生活的方式。美軍帶來了他們的自尊心，自信力和克己的精神。日本人民不但看到，而且體會到美軍這種精神，而這種精神正反映美軍在國內受到的最高訓練。於是日民漸漸感到過去敎育的錯誤，過去領袖的失敗及過去信仰的悲劇，這種感覺。一天一天的加深，終於釀成一種精神革命；……這精神革命正是佔領日本一年來最大的收穫——是民主力量在求永久和平中的收獲。……」</p>
<h3>太陽旗暗然失色！密蘇里艦上簽降一幕</h3>
<p>— 君默</p>
<p>一九四五年九月二日，星期日，東京灣上的黎明現出了一片灰暗陰霾的天空。太陽沒有露臉，似乎正象徵着這太陽旗帝國的衰亡。這就是密蘇里艦上日本正式簽降的日子。簽降典禮經過只二十分鐘，但在大典完畢以後，突然地，陽光從雲中出來，灑還了綠波油油，金光閃閃的海面上。</p>
<p>八點三十分，麥克阿應元帥和海爾賽上將走上了密蘇里主力艦。各種各樣的海軍船艦拱衛四周，前後遊弋；　機在上空警戒盤旋。中·美·英·蘇·法五國國旗飄揚在甲板上，一百以上的盟國高級將領聚集在船舷兩旁，注視着船長室前面的甲板空地。那就是降書簽字的所在，一張舖着綠毯的小桌子放在那裘，前後各放着一把椅子。</p>
<p>九點差十分，各盟國代表出臨甲板。遠處，東方的地平綫上正響　隱　的雷聲。裝着一隻假腿的外相重光葵爬上了密蘇里艦舷的扶梯，後面跟着的是參謀總長梅津美治郞。兩個人默默地走過盟國代表們的前面時，旣無人與他們交談，也無人與他們招呼。十一國的代表們都是扳着臉。</p>
<p>受降典禮的主持人麥克阿瑟元帥站在中間。左是溫立德將軍，貝西伐將軍，右是尼米茲元帥，海爾賽元帥。其他盟國的代表們，大都穿着金碧輝煌的漂亮制服，站在後面。九點正，麥克阿瑟元帥跨上一步，在擴音機前致辭：</p>
<p>「各主要盟國代表今日羣集此間，簽訂協定。恢復和平。日本帝國之投降條款，業已載於此降書之內，余，盟軍最高統帥，茲堅決聲明：當以公正與容忍之決心担負余之責任，並當採取一切必要措置，使投降條款　全部，迅速，忠實履行。</p>
<p>「余現請日本帝國代表及日本最高參謀本部代表上前簽訂降書。」</p>
<p>重光葵脫下禮帽，走到桌前，在長十二吋寬八吋的降書上簽下了名字。</p>
<p>梅津美治郞隨即板着一張鐵靑的面孔，走到桌前，坐下來，急急忙忙地簽下了自已的名字。</p>
<p>「盟國最高統帥現代表一切與日本作戰之國家簽字。請溫立德將軍與貝西伐將軍陪同上前。」</p>
<p>這兩位將軍是珍珠港事變後菲列賓一役中苦鬥經月終被日軍俘獲的英雄。現在，他們是出了這口氣了。</p>
<p>麥帥簽字共用了五枝筆，第一校　與滬立德將軍，第二枝贈與貝西伐將軍，第三枝，贈獻美國政府保存，第四枝贈與他出身的母校西點軍校，第五枝，是一枝小小的紅色自來水筆，贈與他的夫人。</p>
<p>麥帥簽畢起立，宣佈：「美國代表簽字。」</p>
<p>尼米茲走到桌前，迅即簽（畢，退回原位。</p>
<p>「中國代表簽字。」</p>
<p>軍令部長徐永昌上將代表中國簽了字。</p>
<p>然後是英，蘇，澳，加，法，荷，新西蘭代表先後簽字。</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟元帥於是站在擴音機前，莊嚴地宣佈：</p>
<p>「讓我們　望世界回復和平，並永遠保持和平。典禮完畢。」</p>
<p>兩百五十架以上的轟炸機，由五十架B—29式超級堡壘領先，並有成百的戰鬥機結隊掩護，隆隆地飛過密蘇里艦的上空，似乎是在向垂頭喪氣的日本代表示威。就在這時候，陽光從雲中露出臉來，普照大地。</p>

<h3>日本乞降因果</h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>日本投降已經整整一年了。猶憶一年之前的今日，日本駐華派遣軍總司令岡村寗次在南京正式簽訂中國戰區日軍的無條件投降書，本來決心要把中國打到屈膝爲止的日本，竟向中國屈膝了。現在我們不妨來檢討一下日本爲什麽會失敗的？有許多人會說：日本的失敗，是由於原子炸彈。這個答案，當然相當準確，事實上，在戰爭迫近結束的階段，日本的科學按術的確已經遠落在聯合國之後，死摒的方法，巳經無能爲力了。</p>
<p>但是這還不是失敗的基本原因。</p>
<p>最大的敵人是日人自己</p>
<p>我們該記得日本在戰爭的初期，的確獲得相當的收穫，那麽原先握在日本手裹的主動權，怎麼會落入聯合國的手裏去的呢？從前有一個軍略家說過：「一個國家最大的敵人往往是她自己」。日本的失敗，的確也是「咎由自取」。</p>
<p>讓我們先就日本突襲珍珠港一點來講：那一决突襲不但使美國人憤慨萬分，同時使日本國民也茫然若失，我們祗要看日本發動太平洋戰爭的日期，就可以看出日本軍人的不智；東條和他的徒衆不在希特勒開始攻蘇的時候出擊，也在德軍圍攻史太林格勒的時候才起而響應，而在一九四</p>
<p>一年十二月八日發動，實在是極大的失着。因爲當時蘇軍正在冰雪嚴寒之中反擊德軍，所以沒有收到和德國戰爭策略配合運用的效力，這是日本政府所犯的第一個嚴重錯誤。</p>
<p>第二個錯誤，就是日本戰略的不一致。日本海軍的目樣是在控制太平洋的中部和西部，而陸軍則要征服亞洲的東南部和中部。日本最高指揮部的戰略就建築在這兩種目標上，結果兩種目標都無從貫澈／</p>
<p>猶如某軍略家所說的，戰爭是一種集中的藝術。假如日本在一個時期抱定一個目標，她或許有轉變的機會；但是日本人並沒有這樣做，而把注意力分散在兩個目標上，等到發覺錯誤的時候，已經來不及了。</p>
<p>照德日義三國的聯合戰略講：這三個軸心國應該設法在某些地方成立聯繫，但是她們沒有採取一致的行動。當羅美爾在菲洲大破英軍直迎迫歷山大港的時候，日軍應該向蘇彝士運河方面全力出擊，而在印度洋一帶建立一個軸心國的橋樑；但是日本人沒有這樣做，反而忙着轟炸達爾文港，並向南太平洋各島展開攻擊，另有一部份兵士則轉移到阿留申羣島方面去。這種零亂的步伐，和聯合國有計劃的一致行動，形成了顯明的對比。</p>
<p>第三個錯誤是過分自信</p>
<p>日本所犯的第三個錯誤，就是過份自信。假如日本人在征服亞洲諸國後，准許她們獲得眞正的自治，或許可以很容易地在亞洲造成親日的情緒。但是東京的日本軍閥以爲最後勝利絕對有把握，所以他們一開始就擬就了帝國主義的計劃，去剝削和控制亞洲各地的人民，日本人努力灌輸憎悉白種人的思想，但是他們自己的所作所爲，也很快地引起了當地人民的憎恨，結果等於自掘墳墓。</p>
<p>日本人所犯的錯誤，並不限於對被征服國家，事實上日本本國的人民，也對政府的行爲深表不滿。在戰爭剛開始的時候，日本人民以爲他們是在從事一次解放戰爭，但是事實眞相的展開，使他們明白一切的宣傳完全是謊言，結果把人民的信念破壞了。戰爭的信念一失掉，根本就沒有勝利的機會。</p>
<p>黷武主義者獲得了殷鑑</p>
<p>同時，戰爭的報道，也使日本人民不再相信日本軍人的說話。例如，日本的報紙時常在講美國第五十八特種混合艦隊已經被「殲滅」了，可是後來這個艦隊竟打到日本的大門上來了。因此，日本人民對於軍人所竭力喧染的勝利，逐漸由懷疑而不信任，由不信任而失望。等到聯合國艦隊兵臨城下，險象環生的時候，已經無法挽回乾坤了。</p>
<p>上述幾點，都是日本失敗的根本原因，日本軍人的偏激，和缺乏遠見，最後造成了悲慘的結果。日本人的敎訓，也可作一切讀武主養者的殷鑒。</p>
<h3>蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理槪觀</h3>
<p>日本在三十四年八月十一日宣佈投降，而我國正式受降是九月九日，距離近一個月，期內淪陷區紛亂情形，是可以想象的；就是受降以後，因爲中央沒有公佈敵僞產業統一接收處理辦法，所以接收工作仍難免參差不一。</p>
<p>上海區敵偽產業處理局成立於三十四年十月二十七日，從奉命到籌備成立不過二三天，非常匆促。這是全國最先成立的接收處理機構，一切沒有前軌可循。行政院十月二十四日所公佈的上海區敵僞產業處理辦法六項，是我們業務上唯一的準繩。</p>
<p>上海是全國最大商埠，東南富庶之區，經過敵僞八年盤据侵奪，產權糾紛產業移轉，原已頭緒紛繁，加上勝利後到本局成立，二個多月聞的變化，情形更見複雜，到三十五年春天，又奉命擴展業務爲蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局，我們的任務也更見艱鉅了。</p>
<p>在這一萬億的收入中，大的百分之四十左右，是本同成立後直接接收的，過去大家注意到敵僞工廠的龐大衆多，不知敵偽物資亦很可觀，而物資的保管處理，比工廠更爲艱難，敵僞房地產也是如此，價值亦相當可觀，又査緝所得收入，幾乎是意外的，假使稍一放鬆，早就已經五分四散了。</p>
<p>敵僞產業收入，列為國庫預算，所以必須盡量變賣繳解，除了一部份機關經行政院核准可以轉賬讓售外，其餘槪須售現，這是行政院配合財政經濟政策決定的方針，我們祗有遵照辦理。到八月底止，先後已繳解國庫國幣二千三百三十一億餘元，轉賬讓售的沒有計算在內。</p>
<p>接收處理一般情形，大槪如次：</p>
<p>碼頭倉庫：經由江海關接點的倉庫，共有一千一百五十六所，大體均已接點完畢，倉存各項物資，大半都是委託各機關出售，已騰空倉庫二分之一以上。</p>
<p>工廠：委託經濟部接收的滬市工廠，計四八〇家，其中純粹敵產有二八六廠，依性質分別以機械，化工，舫織三類爲最多。上海以外本區各地接收的工廠，計一六二廠。</p>
<p>接收工廠，法照行政院規定，有撥交資源委員會接管的，撥交紡織事業管理委員會的，撥交由國蠶絲公司的，撥交中華烟草公司的，移交衛生署的，也有發還給盟邦商民，及本國人民的，原則上都應先行復工，其餘便是提出標售，有連同廠房基地標售的，也有僅標售器材的，最近並奉令由後方復員各工廠優先承購或承租經營，以示優待。</p>
<p>產地產傢具：接收敵偽房屋，的有二千一百多幢，土地六百三十多萬畝，估價總値約和千二百餘億元。接收後發還國人及盟僑的房地產也很多。所有敵僞房地產，以出售爲原則，現在正在陸續舉辦標售。接收傢具，計有三萬八千多件，逆產房屋還在外。</p>
<p>燃料：燃料及油類係委託經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會接收，有汽油，飛機汽油，潤滑油等各二千多桶，還有煤油，柴油，酒精等，這些都是液體燃料，固體燃料一項，計烟煤，無烟煤，木炭及柴等，總計七十多萬噸。最近液體燃料改爲委託中國石油公司接收處理。</p>
<p>船舶：委託招商局接收江輪有三五艘，海輪一艘，其他小輪，機帆船，機船，鐵駁，民船等，共計一千二百餘艘，前海軍總司令部共接收一百餘艘，有移交的，也有保留的，至發還船舶，也不下四百多艘。</p>
<p>車輛：委託公路總局接收卡車六百多輛，客車六十多輛，小汽車一千三百餘輛，除一部份讓售各機關及發還外，槪行標售。</p>
<p>軍用品飛機及軍艦</p>
<p>軍用品種類數量均極繁多，統由軍政部接牧，空中運輸工眞由航委會接收者有航空公司工塲機塲七處，飛機一七〇架，軍艦由海軍處接收者計二十一艘</p>
<p>糧食：由糧食部接收，均予標售。</p>
<p>農林漁牧：農林部接收農塲，畜牧，漁業，棉產，蠶桑，獸疫等機構總計五十五單位</p>
<p>教育文化機關：敎育部及市敎育局接收大學及專門學校，研究所，圖書館，敵立中學，偽立中學，敵立小學，體育塲，動物院，影院劇場，又中宣部接收報館，通訊社，廣播電台，電影製片廠，書局文具印刷廠等兩共二百單位。</p>
<p>貿易公司：委託中央信託局接收之敵僞經營貿易公司二六三家，其中物資分別淸理出售。</p>
<p>小型商店：小型商店四六三家，由市政府接收處理，近並移處理局辦理。</p>
<p>金銀錢幣證券：此項產業，包括各機關中·中·交·農四行以及中信，郵匯兩局所接收的在內，以黃金，白銀，美鈔，僞幣爲最多。</p>
<p>原料及成品：以棉紗，棉布，棉花，人造絲等爲最多，化學工業原料，紙類，五金機器零件，等次之，均係委託出售或價讓國營事業機關。</p>
<p>德僑產業：以德孚洋行爲最大，計接收金銀現鈔的値二億元，存貨佔價二百億元，速同其他產業釣共値二百另七億元左右，拜耳藥廠接收存貨估値二十五億元，其他德商洋行，謙信等十家存貨及其他財產合計約三十九億元，以上總計二百八十二億元。所有接收西藥及染料均經整理裝配出售。</p>
<p>逆產：逆產原由前上海地區逆產淸理委員會辦理，後移交本局，本局先後辦理逆產案件五百卅一案，軍統局移交扣押逆產，大致完竣。接收財產，以房屋，　地，股票，飾物，傢具等爲最多，其他有鋼琴，汽車，，籍，古玩等。</p>
<p>以上，可以說是一筆接收帳。另外，有幾件工作，値得補充說明的。</p>
<p>工廠和碼頭倉庫淸理工作，非常繁重，而估價工作沒有絕對標準，所以有時不免受人責難，不過，經過解釋或實地調査後，眞相就會明白的。</p>
<p>査緝工作早經結束，因爲工作性質是接受密報，査緝隱匿，一不經心，就會擾民，這是過去時時叮囑注意的，有些密報人總覺得獎金發得太慢，或者太少，不過據逐案調査，都有特殊的原因，並不是承辦人故意抑壓，可以保證。</p>
<p>解決　權科紛，也是繁重的工作，總共四千多件，逐案需要調査事實，找尋證據，傳詢人質，一而再，再而三，做到無縱無枉，審議會歷次開會，十九都是討論產權糾紛案件，有時當事人說我們處理遲緩，可惜我們不便讓他査看全卷經過紀錄，吾則他一定可以瞭然諒解的。</p>
<p>關於物資變賣，我們一方面求迅速淸理騰空會庫，一方面注重國庫收入。另外，注意協助平抑物價，本局接收物資雖然很多，終究是有限量的，照上海市塲遊資活躍的情形，我們必定要謹愼從事，看準市塲變化，機動拋售，吾則，物資盡入囤戶之手，老百姓非但得不到實惠，反而更加物價高漲的壓迫，所以在方法上平賣拍賣標賣統統採用，在數量和種類上，每决拋售不同不等，使投機者無法取巧，有時，社會上責難我們，我們也極少聲辯，譬如，今春米價高漲時，社會上責難我們爲什麼不大量拋米，事實上我們根本沒有接收到多少米糧，但當時假使這樣說了，米價會跳到什麽程度，各位可以想到，諸如此類的事情很多，我們坦白無愧，但期有利於國家政府，決不爭一日之長。</p>
<p>逆產處理工作，現在開頭，逆產處理委員會已經成立，是會同了法院同人和地方領袖共同組織成立的，這個機構，將來可以單獨存在，一直到業務完全結束</p>
<p>檢討過去十個多月的工作，在行政院和審議會指導之下，承社會各界的協助，總算已渡過了重重難關，假使處理局的工作，還有一點成績的話，是應該歸功於大家的合作。</p>
<p>照目前情形，處理局的業務，三數月內可以大部結束，機構緊也在準備隨時縮，在此期間仍竭誠盼望各界隨時指敎！</p>
<p>處理局成立以後，第一步工作就是遵照院令分函撤銷原有在上海之接收及處理機構，像上海市民營工商業處理委員會，上海市房地產處理委員會，第三方面軍軍品接收委員會，上海市黨政接收委員會，上海地區逆產淸理委員會等，請其撤銷，業務一律移交本局辦理。此項交接工作，也沒有很順利的迅速完成，因爲有極少數的個人或機關，難免認爲旣經接收，就是自己的了，決不有再報吿出來，也有的常初沒有向日人要原始淸册，或者不肯把接收的原始淸册交出來，種種枝枝節節的問題，都需要再三交涉解決，所以一部份產業物資，有一直遲至今年五六月才移交到本局的。在這期間與其說是處理，母寗說是在辦外交。</p>
<p>行政院頒佈的六項處理辦法，是最高原則，在執行時尙需要許多補充條例和辦法，同時，我們決心對每一件事，做到公平合理，一切循着軌道做，沒有例外。所以先後訂定許多章則。這些都是經過專家或主管同事詳細硏究擬定，由審議委員會審愼決議，送經行政院核准備案後施行的，以後我們處理案件，必求其能與這些章則規定辦法相配合。同時適應新發生的事實，訂立新的章則。</p>
<p>說到接收的產業物資，大概佔計總値在一萬億元以上，若照種類加以分析，內中（一）現金十五億元，（二）原料成品三千億元，（三）金銀首飾九百億元，（四）工廠三千億元，（五）房地產一千億元，（六）碼頭倉庫一千億元，（七）德僑產業三百億一元，（八）船舶一百億元，（九）糧食九十七億元，（十）金融機構八億元，（十一）文化設備五十五億元，（十二）水產二十五億元，（十三）燃料二十三億元，（十四）車輛二十三億元，（十五）錢幣二十三億元，（十六）有價證券十八億元，（十七）傢供十八億元，（十八）農塲十五億元。此外，逆產部份和軍品部份尙未佔列。若依來源性質來分析，的略佔計，屬於純粹敵產的的爲五成，至六成，屬於偽產的的爲三成，其餘的佔一成左右。</p>

<h3>一年來的國是</h3>
<p>— 許我明</p>
<p>自從日寇乞降以來的過去的一年間的中國政治，環繞在兩件具有歷史意義的文件上：（一）和平建國　領的制定及其它有關協議的成立；（二）蔣主席於日本無條件投降一周年在廬山所發表的文吿。和平建國綱領的制定及其它有關協議的成立是過去一年間最具有意義的成就，爲了制定並謀實行道個方案，我們看見有主席與中共領袖毛澤東氏去秋在陪都的會談，政治協商會議的召開，憲草審議委員會之集會，以及在軍事方面有由軍事小組會議所成立之基本方案及調處執行小組的分往各處執行調處，以及停戰命令之頒發與展長等等。凡此種種活動，占據了過去一年間前期的大部份時間。可是由各方辛勸努力以獲致的協議，在執行或實行上却遭遇到非常的困難，和平建綱方案的制定及其它有關協議的成立，除政府方而片面可實行者外，到如今還沒有實踐，「軍隊國家化」還依舊僅是一個理想，「政治民主化」亦仍復僅是一個目的。而且更因爲有「商談」的關係，遂致演成所謂「邊談邊打」的拖宕局勢，自從入春以來，長春哈爾濱旣先後被共軍侵占，「蘇北」「中原」又發動有大規模的攻勢，兵戈處處，民不聊生，而全國幹錢的交通，除京滬及粵漢等地區外，依舊阻滯未能恢復，以是國家人民，交感其困。在此局勢之下，我主席乃於日本無條件投降一周年紀念前夕，發表具有歷史意味的文吿於廬山，指出時局癥結之所在及處理今後時局方針六點，是爲過去一年間後期最主要的文獻，本報曾評爲「民族復興的大憲章」，可知其關係之重要。到了最近又有關於進行商談改組國府而成立五人小組的計議，期於國府改組之中，對於常前局勢能够爲基本的解決。此項五人小組的計議雖是最近的事，但其意義，仍未能超出前面所舉的兩種具有歷史意義的文件以外。</p>
<p>政治協商會議，無疑地，是過去一年間最具有意義的政治事件。此一會議的召開，淵源於抗戰勝利後，政府與中共代表的會談。抗戰旣吿勝利，蔣主席爲商討國家大計，邀中共中央委員會主席毛澤東氏前來陪都，毛氏應約於去年八月廿八日抵渝，晋見主席，曾作多次會談，同時雙方各派出代表，在友好和諧的空氣中，進行較詳盡的商談，並於國慶紀念日，雙方共同發表會談記要於重慶。其第一點爲雙方「一致認爲中國抗日戰爭，業已勝利結束，和平建國的新階段，即將開始，必須共同努力，以和平團結統一爲基礎，並在蔣主席領導之下……建設獨立自由和富强的新中國，澈底實行三民主義。雙方又同認蔣主席所倡導之政治民主化，軍隊國家化，及黨派平等合法，爲達到和平建國必由之途徑。其第二點爲雙方「一致認爲應迅速結束訓政，實施憲政，並應先採必要步驟，由國民政府召開政治協商會議，邀請各黨派代表及社會賢達，協商國是，討論和平建國方案及召開國民大會各項問題。……」這是根據這一要點的精神，政治協商會議乃於本年一月十日召開於陪都，計會員國民黨代表八人，共產黨代表七人，中國靑年黨代表五人，由國民主同盟代表九人，「無黨無派代表」即所謂「社會賢達』九人，至一月卅一日，會議圓滿結束。</p>
<p>在「政協」閉幕席上，在蔣主席的開幕詞裏，主席「認爲各案（政治協商會議所成立的各案）之中，要算和平建國綱領爲各種方案的基本及中心，因爲此案……的各條規定，均屬異常完備，確合時代要求，充滿了統一性，充滿了民主性，實在是渡到憲政時期最適宜的綱領。我們有了這個綱領，由中央以至全國各地方的政府，由各黨各派與社會領導人士，以至全國各地的同胞，都有了共同遵守的準則。允其參加木會議的各黨各派，對於這個綱領，旣是大家共同商討，共同議定，而且就要參加政府來共同執行，我們對全國同胞，必須守信義，負責任自身先從事實行動方而有切實遵行的表現，並且必須貫澈其全國性，使能普遍的實現。」這個由各黨各派曁社會賢達所協商成立的和平建國綱領，在其總則上，規定：「（一）遵奉三民主義爲建國之最高指導原則；（二）全國力量在蔣主席領導之下，團結一致，建設統一，自由。民主之新中國；（三）確認蔣主席所倡導之「政治·民主化」，『軍隊國家化』及黨派平等合法爲達到和平建國必由之途徑；（四）用政治方法解決糾紛，以保持國家之和平發展」。其關於軍事方面者爲確保軍隊編制與軍令之統一，軍隊改制，實行軍黨分立，軍民分治，所有全國軍隊應按照整軍計劃，切實縮編，凡此均爲所以達到「軍隊國家化」的目的。</p>
<p>至關於「政治民主化」方面者，則有關於充實國府，國民大會及憲法草案之協議，以國府爲最高決策機關，容納各方人士。就中關於憲草部分，有主張採「兩院制」及「內閣制」者，不過爲對於國大之一種參考，對於國大本無拘束能力。其關於國大部分，幾經波折，終也成了協議，即新增代表七百名，這七百名中，國民黨代表占二百三十名，共產黨占二百名，民主同盟占一百名，靑年黨一百名，社會賢達七十名，並由國民黨與共產黨商定，各於其名額內讓予十名與民主同盟，即國民黨爲二百二十名，共產黨爲一百九十名，民主同盟一百二十名，協議旣定，國府下令定於本年五月五日召開國民大會於南京，不意中共蓄意破壞，其它黨派復從而附和，延不提出代表名單，致國大不能不再爲延期，乃復展期至本年十一月十二日。此外。政府代表與共黨代表，在馬歇爾特使協助之下，又簽訂了停止衝突與恢復交通的辦法。</p>
<p>「政協」旣經商有協議，國府乃於本年五月五日正式宣吿還都南京，同時，昭吿總理，展謁陵寢，至是西遷八年之政府，重回國父所定之首都，但國內的政治晴空，却不因政府的還都而增加其明朗，自還都以來，各小組雖多保持接觸，然實際局勢却愈趨惡化，致有「這談這打』的局面，拖延累月，了無結果。「整編」「統編」協議之墨瀋未乾，不但軍令政令未能統一中共軍，隊且四出侵襲，國內交通梗阻如故：停戰之命令縱無期延長，而戰鬥之行爲初未曾有稍减輕，人民疾苦，日益加深，政治僵局，迄未打開，蔣主席乃於日本無條件投降周年紀念前夕，對全國人民發表文吿於廬山，指出一年來國內局勢之　結，端在中共對於所成立之各項協議未能實踐，故意阻撓，擴大困難。對於處理今後時局方針，主席指出六點：「（一）斷不因任何阻碍而延遲結束訓政開始憲政的程序，十一月十二日的國民大會必定如期召集。（二）對於政治協商會議所有的決議，必衷誠遵守，盡力推行，關於憲法草案，祗求薈萃各方面更好的意見，提供國民大會討論抉擇，以期制成完善可行的憲法。（三）對於擴大政府基礎，邀請各黨派無黨派人士參加，務求從速實現，並以和平建國綱領爲施政的準繩。（四）關於停止衝突，仍未遵守原議，忠實履行，而且我們並不要求共軍退出其在停戰令後所攻佔的地區，祗是要求其撤出若干已經構成和平威脅和阻碍交通的地區。（五）關於政治紛爭，仍採取政洽解決的方法，只要共產黨軍隊忠實執行停止衝突，恢復交通的成議，邀從調處，實施統編，使軍隊國家化不致徒托空言，此層一有保證，政府隨時可與之具體商談所有未決的問題。（六）當前人民最迫切的要求，在於安居樂業，所以政府必當盡力解除和平的威脅，更必竭盡職責，以保陣人民生命財產與安全。</p>
<p>自從　主席這篇文吿發表後，對於處理今後時局顯示了明確的方針，令人讀了眞彷彿有「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」的感覺。依據這篇文吿的精神，馬司兩使不以高齡溽暑往返於京枯之間，奔走幹旋，乃有成立五人小組討論改組國府委員會的計議，其任務限於討論國府委員會改組事項，不及其它；政府且已指定吳鐵城及張厲生兩氏爲代表，司使亦同意於担任主席，乃共黨方面初則要求「否決權」，繼則又提它項條件以爲要挾，以是該項計議，現已瀕於流產；然馬使仍復不辭勞瘁，往復奔走，究竟該項小組能吾成立，成立後能否成立協議，成立協議後能吾照議忠實履行，這要待將來的事實發展來證明了。</p>
<p>綜上所述，過去一年來國內政局的癥結全在中共對於所成立的協議未能履行。政府為顧念戰後人民需要生養休息的機會，不惜忍辱負責以極度的忍讓，與中共及各黨派無黨派人士開誠協商，而此項協商的成果距料因共黨的延不遵守實施，竟成其文，是則何貴乎協議的成立？今日我們來檢討一年來的國內政局，爲了人民，我們要再籲請中共不再以人民爲敵，對於已成立的協議旣要信守執行，對於此後的建國，尤賴精誠的團結。戰後一年來的世界政局動盪不安，在這動盪不安的世界中，各黨派尤須衷心合作，以致力於中國的復興。</p>

<p>在四國外長會讓休會的一個月之間，英美與蘇聯的蒂芥，愈結愈深。在美國方面使蘇聯不滿的地方有（一）：美國似不願貸款與波蘭；（二）英美對於羅馬尼亞的局勢，提出抗議；（三）英美干涉南斯拉夫前陸長米哈洛維區將軍被控通敵一案；（四）德國往來於多腦河上的船隻，被美國佔領軍扣留；（五）依照波茨坦協定，規定德國應以某種工業設備，作爲賠償之用，美軍當局下令停止搬運；（六）英國駐在希臘的軍隊不肯撒退。此在蘇聯方面，也有對英美不友好的行爲；（一）蘇聯與其勢力範圍以內所有各國，增强密切關係；蘇波協定的簽字，即可證明；（三）南斯拉夫元首狄托元帥，又訪問莫斯科，反美的態度，更加露骨；（三）丹麥亦有向東方發展貿易之趨勢；（四）蘇軍又自奧國開往德境增防；（五）英國舉行勝利閱兵典禮，蘇聯波蘭及南斯拉夫三國軍隊，均未參加。（六）蘇聯對土耳其海峽的野心，也已成爲路人皆知的事實；（七）蘇聯在伊朗南部活動，威脅英國利益。</p>
<p>一月之後會議重開</p>
<p>休會一個月，忽已屆滿，四國外長於六月十六日又在巴黎開會了，美國國務卿貝爾納斯抱了致力和平最大的決心，重往巴黎，臨行時杜魯門總統曾親自送他到飛機塲，使貝爾納斯益感道次外長會議，「只許成功，不許失敗。」可是到了巴黎，樂觀的空氣，非常淡薄。不過貝爾納斯的唯一目的，只要使廿一國和會能够舉行，就算是一極大的成就了，其他的問題都可提到和會裏去討論。</p>
<p>在第二次四國外長會議的席上，英美兩國外長堅決主張廿一國和會定於七月廿八日在巴黎舉行，但是蘇聯代表則表示異議，認爲非至各項懸案商得協議之後，不能召廿一國和會。經過幾塲的舌戰，蘇聯終算讓步，在原則上贊成英美的建議，但是討論到廿一國和會的邀請國及其議事程序，又引起了爭執。幸賴法國從中一再調處，未致陷於決裂。並加緊工作，完成了五種和約草案，即對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和的草案，至七月十五日閉幕，其所獲得的成來，有下列各項：</p>
<p>（一）關於和會問題，四國外長決定廿一國和會定於七月廿八日在巴黎舉行，討論對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和的草案；德奧問題，暫不討論·</p>
<p>（二）關於和的問題，四國外長一致通過對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和的草案。</p>
<p>第二次四國外長會議在開會期間，雖然唇槍舌劍，波瀾迭起，但最後能獲得上述兩大結果，不能不說比以前幾次會議已有進步了。</p>
<p>一九四六年七月廿八日，廿一國代表，雲集法國盧森堡宮，戰後第一次和會終於世人的屬目之下開幕了。到今天作者執筆爲止，快已滿四十天了。其間雖然舌戰迭起，波瀾洶湧大有一波未平，一彼又起之勢，但是全世界喁喁望治的人民，莫不盼望和會成功，我們也相信巴黎和會的前途光社，不久來會圓滿閉幕的。（九月六日）</p>
<h3>受降後之善後救濟</h3>
<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>行總成立於三十四年一月，也就是勝利之前八個月·因爲敵軍封鎖了我國的海岸綫，所以在這八個月中，一切運輸都不能不仰仗於飛越駝峯的空運。</p>
<p>我們要聯合國要求接濟的物資，一共是四百萬公噸，但是在道勝利前八個月內，空運到達我國的物資總重量却祗有一百噸左右。所以，我們不妨說，所有善後救濟的工作，差不多全都是在受降以後做的。</p>
<p>因爲日本的投降來得有些一突然，許多預定的計劃都受到了影響。行總在中國實施善後救濟，本來是擬有相當完備的計劃的，也因爲這次勝利來得有些意外，多少發生了一些脫節的現象。譬如說，爲了儘速使物資到達中國，於是就有許多在行駛巾的船隻臨時改變航程，把接濟軍隊的物資改駛中國。這是盟邦對我國的美意，我們當然祗有感激，但是運來的物資，就不一定都是爲我國一般急待救濟的老百姓所需要。其次，因爲我們自己還沒有能把運輸工具和交通綫恢復到相當程度，因之物資就不免出淸較遲，引起了聯總方面的指摘，甚至於聯總的署長拉伽第亞還下了停運物資來華的命令。</p>
<p>如果我們在勝利後能够和平統一，這種暫時的脫節應當是很快就可以調整的，然而緊接着來的却是轉瞬就蔓延得不可收拾的全國烽烽火。行總在這時遭受到了最大的試騐——不幸，她無法應付這個太大的打擊！</p>
<p>新的災區產生了，蘇北難民的救濟成爲一個重要的課題，按照行總原來的計劃，這一部份的救濟是還沒有現在這樣嚴重的。</p>
<p>交通的恢復因戰事而幾乎成爲不可能。像山東北部，救濟物資就無法穿過層層火綱。部隊攔截物資的事故層見疊出，救濟人員殉職的也已經達數十人之多。船隻，車輛，伕役，常遭徴發，許多地區的善後救濟都已入於麻痺狀態。而且，根本上聯總對我國的接濟也已大打折扣。我們所急體的食糧，得到的不及需要額的十分之四。而這總額十分之四的一點東西，還要因爲交通困難和運輸工具的缺乏而無法運到應當受到緊急救濟的地區！</p>
<p>同時，行總的機構却是配合了原來的計劃而設立的，工作的限期相當急迫，許多事都來不及準備，例如行總各救濟區的通信網都不及布置，例如，至今行總烟台辦事處打出的電報，上海總署還從未收到過，在道種情形之下，試問又怎樣「爭取時間」？</p>
<p>最近聽說聯總的工作時期有延長的可能，誠然是一件稍能令人安心的消息，但是如果局面不能迅速澄淸，善後救濟工作的前途還是暗淡的。</p>

<h3>紀念「九九」勝利·要向　主席致敬</h3>
<p>「我們要自信我們民族的前途始終是光明遠大，任何阻力決不能遏止我們的復興。中正自許身革命，經歷百艱，領導抗戰，時逾八載，斷不能任令我無數軍民犧牲流血所換取的中華民國之生命輕予摧毁，決不忍使我鋒鏑餘生的人民坩加痛苦，亦決不因任何的刺激或阻礙而變更我祈求和平統一民主的旣定步驟，誓必本我良知，盡我天職，按程序，循常軌，領導我全國同胞，向建國的大道而邁進，耿耿心願，乘今日紀念的機會，而披瀝於我同胞之前，深望一德一心，努力奮鬥，以消弭我國家的浩刦，保全我民族的命脈，共同一致克竟我革命建國的全功。一（恭錄蔣主席吿全國同胞書）</p>
<h3>要覺悟要建國</h3>
<p>今天是抗戰勝利紀念日，我們紀念這個日子，有無限的興奮，亦有無限的悲痛。我們數十年來受敵人侵凌的痛苦，從去年今日湔雪凈盡，國家躋於五强之林，眞使我們感到無限的興奮，我記得去年在重蔓得到日本投降的消息，多少人在鼓舞在歡，都想急返故鄉，骨肉重聚，每個人都憧憬着和平後的美滿生活。可是勝利迄今業已週年，多少人仍在外漂流，其艱辛痛苦倍於戰時，想起來實在痛心。</p>
<p>勝利之後，主席爲謀政治合理解決，來保障勝利成果，使人民得到休養生息，而期早日完成建國的大業起見，曾召集會商，簽定雙十會談紀要，嗣特召開政治協商會議，諮詢各方意見，政府在最大讓步下，完成協商會議，頒佈施政綱領，簽定整軍方案，商訂恢復交通辦法，經一年協商之結果，文字的協定雖然先後簽定了，但是實際的情形又怎樣呢？我們要不切實履行，會將勝利成果糟坍凈盡，怎麼對得起爲抗戰而犧牲的百萬軍民？怎麼對得起誠心協助我們的友邦！</p>
<p>「夫人必自梅而後人侮之」這句老話，我們應該深聽其意，過去數十年來之國恥，一半固係受侵略，一半亦由於自侮，在國際間的地位，日趨低落，不平等條的相繼簽訂，過着次殖民地的生活，日人更是得寸進尺，最後造成七七事變，想一鼓以達其滅我全國之目的，當時我在北平負責軍政，遵照中樞意旨，在不喪權，不辱國之原則下，與日方折衝，無奈日本滅我國家之方針旣定，用盡任何方法皆不能獲致和平，於是率部首先抵抗，全國經八年血戰終獲最後勝利，今年六月奉命東渡作證，見到那些九年前欺壓我們的戰犯，再使我們有無限的興奮與感想，固然日本有侵我之旣定計劃與步驟，假設過去我全國能團結一致，發奮圖强，共禦外侮，九一八同七七事變，會不會發生，頗有硏究。我們抗戰勝利後，各方人士若能同心協力，共謀建國，最低限度，國家不是現在這個樣子。</p>
<p>我最近在日本旅行，就耳聞到日本可能此我們復興更快的話，我心裏感有無限之憂慮我們，同心協力共謀建國還恐怕趕不上，若是自生阻撓，自相破壞，何時能追上這大時代的進步？現在有接收的物資，有盟邦的協助，千載一時的復興建國的好機會，何忍坐視放棄？</p>
<p>我向來是主張和平統一，因爲人民太苦，經不起戰亂，經濟社會滿目瘡痍，更經不起戰亂，政府有此基本認識，故不惜委曲求全，力主和平，堅持以政治方式解決糾紛，站在國家民族之立塲上固應如此，即站在各黨派之立塲上，亦只有循此和平途徑，才有辦法。大家都喊爲國家，爲民族，在抗戰初期，大家都能團結爲國，爲何勝利之後，反面不能合作呢？</p>
<p>人民之基本要求，爲安居樂業，而回憶數十年來，有幾夭的安樂？這數十年的紛亂，還不够敎訓我們嗎？第一次世界大戰後，我們即失去韓國的良機，難道還希望國家再走上被人侵佔，人民被人屠殺的路嗎？人民是國家的眞正主人，應該尊重人民的利益，才能爭取國家的生存，苦戰八年，人民應該休養生息了，我們需要和平，需要建國，不要再失良機，貽害於子子孫孫。希望大家覺悟，把握現實，警惕不來，以國家民族利益高於一切之原則，在主席領導之下，共同完成建國使命，才不愧紀念道個偉大的日子。</p>
<p>過去租界時期犯罪狀況</p>
<h3>勝利後的上海　治安在邁進中</h3>
<p>— 師</p>
<p>上海在租界時期刑事犯罪案件之多，內　的複雜，不僅在國內各都市中首屈一指，就是在國外亦不多見，以前公共租界警務處總巡白魯斯（Brnce）在一九二八年第一期倫敦敦出版的警察雜誌（Te　Police　Jourral）上說上海因爲中國民族主義的抬頭，內地治安的不佳，租界與其他地區的不易隔絕，犯罪之多和警察工作的困難，比較英國爲允甚，實際上中國民族主義的抬頭與犯罪的多少風馬牛不相及，內地的治安如南京杭州的刑事犯罪數字，當時遠較上海爲少；治安較上海好得多。只有不平等條的的制度，纔是過去上海犯罪多而複雜的基本原因。</p>
<p>一，領事裁判權掩護了許多國際犯罪的職業家，愛狄米勒的上海，冒險家的樂園裏就叙說許多國際的犯罪職業家，被其他國家驅逐出境，無地容身，而在上海很容易的登陸，繼續他們的犯罪生涯，有許多外交家牧師銀行家以印發假護照販賣軍火烟毒製造賭具，包庇賭場，詐欺殺人爲職業，這都是中國法律無法防範制裁，而受到領判權有形無形的掩護。</p>
<p>二，租界制度的存在割裂了上海警權，增加犯罪逃避的方便和刑事警察工作的困難，租界正和中國之命運裏所說，「是中國國內的國家」上海過去除掉上海市政府外，就同時有這樣兩個不同的「國家」一是公共租界，一是法租界。譬如在公共租界的東　橋犯了罪，向南過了一條馬路，前愛多亞路到了法租界，公共租界的巡捕就無法拘捕，在越界築路旁邊中國商店裏犯了罪，跨出大門到了馬路上，中國警察就無法行使警權，這種畸形不合理的制度，只是給犯罪者以最大的方便和鼓勵，而給負治安責任的人以冷酷的嘲笑和不可克服的困難。</p>
<p>三，殖民地的統治方法是培養犯罪的最好溫牀。租界當局僅注意到軍事上經濟上的控制，而忽略了租界內絕對大多數中國人的組織，（人口從無統計）敎育和社會生活福利風氣的指導。有意無意地放任烟賭娼和投機商業的無限制發展破壞了社會舊有的道德，使人民日趨腐化墮落培養出無數的犯罪因素，這樣的社會，就減少犯罪等於緣木朮魚。</p>
<p>四，過去犯罪的統計（根據公共租界工部局年報紀錄法租界及市公安局紀錄不全從闕）</p>
<p>一，刑事案件總數</p>
<p>廿六年　一九五五八件</p>
<p>廿七年　一九〇六四件</p>
<p>廿八年　二七八四八件</p>
<p>廿九年　三〇九八〇件</p>
<p>三十年</p>
<p>二六〇二四件</p>
<p>平均每年二〇四六九件　每月一七〇六件</p>
<p>二，綁匪（包括已遂及未遂）</p>
<p>廿九年　八〇件</p>
<p>平均每年六十六件　每月五件半</p>
<p>三，强盜</p>
<p>廿七年　六八四件</p>
<p>廿八年　一二三三件</p>
<p>廿九年　二二七五件</p>
<p>三十年　一四二八件</p>
<p>三十年　五二件</p>
<p>平均每年一四〇五件　每月一一七件</p>
<p>四，竊盜</p>
<p>廿六年　一三二三八件</p>
<p>廿七年　一二七二三件</p>
<p>廿八年　一七五七二件</p>
<p>平均每年一四五一一件　每月一二〇九件</p>
<p>（當時公共租界人口約佔全上海三分之二，的及目前上海全人口二分之一）</p>
<p>目前治安狀況</p>
<p>從去年九月十二日起光復了整個大上海。一百年的不平等條件下所產生的租界和領事裁判權已不復存在同時上海的治安當局也担負起前所未有的重大責任，八年的抗戰和敵僞的摧殘，上海的物質精神，都遭遇到空前的損失，再加接收伊始，工廠未盡復工，失業增加，貨幣變更，生活指數並未低落，復員期聞散兵游勇不少，民間散失槍械尙未登記。就是上海一部份人的心理，一方面求治過切，希望過高，責備求全，另一方面過去殘餘不正確的習非成是的成見，也還沒有澈底拋棄。所以初接收後六個月的治安，只求穩定，只做到使犯罪的數字不再超過租界時期，到半年以後刑事犯罪的紀錄已逐漸減少，循入常軌，不僅比過去少，幷且比初接收時也少了許多。</p>
<p>（一）刑案總數（去年九月十二日至今年八月底）　一九三九四件</p>
<p>（二）綁票（去年十月至今年八月底）發生十五件破獲十七件（內破獲二件係鄰縣發生者）</p>
<p>（三）强盜</p>
<p>卅四年十月一一八件十一月一四二件　十二月一三一件</p>
<p>卅五年一月一〇六件　二月九二件　三月八八件</p>
<p>接收初六個月平均每月一一三件</p>
<p>卅五年四月一〇一件　五月七五件　六月八一件　七月六三件　八月三二件</p>
<p>半年後五個月平均每月七〇件最少八月比最高去年十一月減少一一〇件</p>
<p>（四）竊盜</p>
<p>卅四年十月一〇〇件十一月一三四二件　十二月一四四七件</p>
<p>卅五年一月一二五四件　二月八一三件　三月一〇三〇件</p>
<p>接收初六個月平均每月一一四九件</p>
<p>卅五年四月一〇一九件　五月九八〇件　六月八六一件　七月七三一件　八月五七一件</p>
<p>半年後五個月平均每月八三二件（竊犯在全部再犯中佔百分之三九·二五在累犯巾佔百分之七〇·二七）</p>
<p>（五）獲犯（去年九月十二日至八月底）</p>
<p>綁匪二三人强盜三四七人</p>
<p>竊盜四六六九人烟毒犯一八五六人</p>
<p>（根據上海市警察局的統計）</p>
<p>日本投降代表</p>
<p>（一）駐軍日軍最高指揮官陸軍大將　村　次（右起第四人）。（二）日軍總參謀長陸軍中將小林淺三郞（右起第三人）。（三）日艦隊司令官海軍中將福田良三（右起第五人）。（四）今井武夫（右起第二人）。（五）澤山　　（右起第六人）。（六）小笠原淸（右起第一人）（七）三澤昌雄（右起第七人）。</p>
<h3>犯罪案檢討與展望</h3>
<p>一，從上面前公共租界和目前市警察局的兩種統計中我得到以下兩點的概念：</p>
<p>（一）目前整個上海犯罪的數量只及到當年公共租界的一區。</p>
<p>（二）重要刑事犯罪現在比公共租界一區還少，幷且有遂月漸少的趨勢。</p>
<p>二，這原因不外：</p>
<p>（一）警權完整工作困難漸少，犯罪逃避困難。</p>
<p>（二）軍警指揮統一，效力加强。</p>
<p>（三）治盜匪用重刑，使犯罪者不敢輕於嘗試。</p>
<p>（四）社會生活秩序較租界時爲嚴肅，滅少犯罪因素。</p>
<p>三，但是上海社會受了不平等條約一百年的影響，少數人的殘留的生活習慣心理一時還沒有全部忘懷，而戰後必然的困難，也不是短時間所能完全解決，同時接收後的治安機關無論力量設備和技術，以及人員的訓練紀律素質上，都還有許多地方必須改進。另一方面僅從消極的法律的制裁來減少犯罪，收效還是不够，必須在社會上有積極的法治精神的倡導，對治安機關有進一步的合作與同情纔能確保今後的治安。只有上海治安能穩定，纔能使上海走上正當的繁榮的建設的道途。</p>

<h3>日戰犯罪行</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>他們都製造過一連串血淋淋的罪行，聯合國的人民，爲了過去所得慘痛的教訓，爲了奠定今後世界的和平，必須將一筆血債，向他們從頭清算！</p>
<p>勝利已一周年了，回顧八年以來—不，十四年甚至五十二年以來，日本軍閥的侵華舊帳，在今天痛定思痛，對於這批戰爭的製造者，無疑地應予以澈底的總清算。</p>
<p>就從九一八事變算起，這些戰犯，荒木，土肥原，近衍，松井，橋本，東條，小磯……抱着侵略中國侵略世界的野心，連續地製造無數的事件：熱河事件，一二八事變，內蒙事件，塘沽協定，何梅協定，張北事件，豐台事件，盧溝橋事變，八一三事變，南京大屠殺，華中華南各地大屠殺，張鼓峰事件，珍珠港事變，直到太平洋戰爭全面展開。戰爭期間，他們更製造了多少罪惡—屠殺政策，毒化政策，腐化政策，搜括糧食物資，樹立傀儡政　……這些血淋淋的事實，帶給全世界人士以極度的憤　與恐怖。</p>
<p>去年八月日本投降後，中國當局已決定了對於日本戰犯的處置，據中國陸軍總司令部受降報告，規定在中國的日本戰犯，由各行營，各戰區長官，按照軍委會所發名單，查明逮捕；已回日本本國者，由外交部轉請美政府飭美佔領軍統帥部逮捕交付。捕獲戰犯由各區戰犯拘留所收押，而由軍事法庭審判。到目前為止，被捕及受審者有山中久一，酒井隆等數百人；由美軍交付我國的有磯谷　介，谷壽夫等多人。</p>
<p>麥帥率美軍登陸日本後，亦即下令逮捕日本戰犯，包括土肥原，小磯，平沼等。今年五月三日，聯合國國際法庭在東京揭幕，首席檢察官為季楠（美），檢察官為向哲溶（中），賈爾（英），哥倫斯基（蘇），孟斯菲爾德（澳），諾蘭（加），奧多（法），穆德（荷），庫義連（紐西蘭），梅濃，賈爾（印），羅培土（菲）等十一人。對這些罪不容誅的戰犯，控以發動侵略戰爭，破壞國際條約，奴役及虐待他國人民，以及與納粹法西斯戰犯勾結等的罪狀，詳細審訊。在屢次審訊中，又揭破了若干年來日本侵略東亞大陸的陰謀。</p>
<p>請注意下述一點：受審的戰犯們都沒有悔悟！他們竟然指摘國際法庭的管轄權，他們還認為一國的負責當局，在國際上不應作為戰犯看待，他們甚至聲稱原子彈轟炸是「更惡劣的謀殺」！</p>
<p>還有一點值得注意的事實：截至今日止，日本的戰犯並未全部經過東京國際法庭的審訊，其中仍多自由自在地充任公職並從事政治活動。而且國際法庭還沒有審判過一個日本財閥，而這些財閥正是日本侵略的發軔者。</p>
<p>我們必得重視這批漏網的戰犯，必須完全加以逮捕，受聯合國的制裁，不可放過一個。</p>
<p>在今天，勝利周年紀念日，我們僅將這些重要戰犯的罪行，公諸全中國以及全世界的人士之前：—</p>
<h3>敗亡之相　東條英機</h3>
<p>太平洋戰爭的禍首，日本首相東條英機，於去年九月十日自殺未死，現正禁閉於大森監獄，在聯合國法庭繼續審訊中。</p>
<p>東條向來譽為「八紘一宇」精神的實踐者。在一九三五年至一九三六年的一年間，曾在東北担任關東軍憲兵司令及關東軍參謀長的職務。近衛組閣時，出任陸軍次官，繼　陸相，一九四二年十二月二日登台組閣，自任首相兼陸相，同月七日，即發動偷襲珍珠港，連夜發出對英美宣戰佈告，直至一九四四年七月太平洋戰事失利後始辭職，其中曾一度兼任內相，軍需相，參謀總長等職。</p>
<p>綜計他在首相任內，罪行之犖犖大者，有下列諸端：第一當然是進犯英美，發動太平洋戰爭，還組織大本營，親自統率陸，海，空三軍，指揮全面作戰。第二是以大東亞為號召，勾引汪逆政府及「滿洲國」，印，緬，泰，越等偽組織，向英美宣戰。第三是勾結德義等國，危害世界和平。再次是確立大規模侵華機構，屠殺我國民衆。此次在東京國際法庭開審中，曾提出關於東條下令虐待俘虜的證據；其通令各集中營云：「勿輕易為人道主義或為個人對俘虜之情感所左右。各俘虜必須嚴於懲戒。予俘虜以應得待過，使日本人民藉此認識日本民族之優秀性格，以及日本民族所得享受之特殊權利及光榮。」此種非人道的荒謬言論，令人髮指！</p>
<p>由於東條的窮兵　武，發動戰爭，把日本民衆送上戰場，充作砲灰，終於使日本弄到一敗塗地，不可收拾的地步。故今日的東條，不獨將受聯合國的嚴厲制裁，即日本的人民們，也應起來清算他的罪惡！</p>
<h3>頭號惡魔土肥原賢二</h3>
<p>揭開十五年來日寇侵華的史料，土肥原實為其中罪魁禍首。他以軍閥爪牙的姿態，第一個武裝侵華。一九三一年九月，任東北特務機關長，與坂垣等創造瀋陽事件，以武力佔領東北，作成「王道樂土」，實行所謂「東北啓發的改革」，又樹立偽滿洲國。當時溥儀的幕後牽線人，正是這土肥原賢二。</p>
<p>土肥原是亞洲大陸情報網的組織者。在日軍強佔熱河，又在內蒙樹立傀儡政權後，土肥原即越長城而南下，展開巨大陰謀，準備侵略華北。日軍於一九三三年三月佔熱河，四月即挑戰，攻我長城各關，五月迫天津，結果成立了「塘沽協定」一九三五年六月，又因日軍官兵強行通過張家口而造成所謂「張北事件」，事後訂立了土肥原，秦德純協定，驅逐察哈爾中央勢力，擁立德王。接着又有一九三六年九月豐台事件。土肥原得寸進尺，策動樹立「華北自治政府」欲誘惑我將領為「華北自治政府」主席，保證援助關於華北的軍事經濟，但為我等所拒絕。土肥原遂對我冀察政務委員會施以強烈的壓力，一方面引誘殷汝耕組織了「冀東防共自治委員會」，自任最高顧問，屢次壓迫的結果，終於爆發盧溝橋事變，而展開了全面抗戰。</p>
<p>七七以前，在平津一帶，所有走私，販毒，強　華工，都係土肥原所作所為。他包辦了華北的一切特殊勢力，所有漢奸，沒有一個不受他的指揮。戰事爆發以後，他還以第五軍團長的資格，施行惡毒的大屠殺：一九四〇年至一九四三年，任最高軍事參議官，嗣後又歷任陸軍航空總監，日本東部軍總司令，新加坡第七方面軍總司令，陸軍教育總監等職務。日本每次侵華，每次開闢新戰場，事先都是由土肥原按排侵略陰謀，所以他實在是戰犯中的頭號惡魔。</p>
<p>對於這樣的一個惡魔，自然再不容他逍遙法外。在聯合國發表第一次通緝戰犯時，土肥原只得自首下獄。</p>
<p>土肥原是日本的「希姆萊」，東北的「勞倫斯」，現在澈底清算的日子已到，我們必須向他身上，查問出他在我國所佈置的一切間諜陰謀的細胞，予以毫不容情的肅清。</p>
<h3>屠殺罪魁松井石根</h3>
<p>令人髮指的南京日軍暴行松井石根便是當時的負責者。估計日軍那時在南京所犯的姦淫案，約二萬餘起中國平民無故被屠殺者一萬二千餘人，販賣烟毒，公開搶劫等更不知有若干起，此種獸行，真是駭人聽聞。</p>
<p>松井現在也在東京國際法庭中受審了，他對南京事件的責任，猶圖規避，自稱：「余認為日軍之紀律甚佳！」但公法昭然，殺人者應負如何責任，當可預斷。</p>
<p>松井向為日本陸軍方面有利人物，以亞細亞協會為號召，自成一派。熟悉我國情形，且諳話語，為一著名之中國通。一九三一年曾以日本陸軍代表的資格，出席日內瓦會議，一九三三年任最高軍事參議官，一九三四年還到過中國，宣傳他的「大亞細亞主義」，一九三七年戰事發生，松井調至中國，在淞滬指揮戰事，南京大屠殺就是他攻陷南京後的「成績」！這時他已被任為華中派遣軍總司令，自一九三七年十月至一九三八年二月為止。</p>
<p>回國後，又主張「亞洲門羅主義」，歷任內閣顧問官，與亞同盟顧問，大政　贊會大東亞事務部顧問，東亞開發會社總裁。</p>
<p>叱咤一時的「皇軍」首領，在俯首於國際法庭之前，可曾想到昔日的威風，而今安在？</p>
<h3>朝鮮懦虎　小磯國昭</h3>
<p>所謂「朝鮮之虎」的小磯國昭，是日本後起的主戰軍閥。一九三〇年以前，在日本軍閥羣中，還是個不重要的配角。一九三二年，勾結土肥原·本莊繁·坂垣等侵我東北，才一躍而被任為「關東軍參謀長」。一九三四年去　後，調任朝鮮軍總司令兩年。其後在平沼內閣及米內內閣中任拓相。一九四二年，當太平洋風雲緊急時，出任朝鮮總督，鎮壓韓人愛國運動，訓練韓國青年，逼迫他們為日本作戰，雷厲風行，得日本政府的重視，遂有「朝鮮之虎」之稱。</p>
<p>日本在太平洋戰事失利，東條倒閣，小磯乃出而「拜命組閣」。在組閣第一天接見記者的談話中稱：「為獲得戰爭最後勝利，大和民族在戰時，統帥與國務協力合作。統帥之權，高於一切，以便把　國策。」在太平洋戰事方面，濫用神風攻擊隊，動員全體官兵，作孤注一擲。對中國戰事始終抱着進攻陪都的野心，一面逼迫印，緬，泰，越等弱小民族，捲入戰爭漩渦；搜括南洋豐富的物資，供戰事的巨大　費。</p>
<p>但小礦的「努力」終歸無效，反使日本更迅速地進入「日暮途窮」的境地。日軍在太平洋上遭盟軍的強烈抵抗，軍事節節失利，小磯內閣不得不於一九四五年四月宣告總辭職。</p>
<p>看這「朝鮮之虎」今日在法庭上還有何話可說？</p>
<h3>標準軍閥荒木貞夫</h3>
<p>東北事變的兇手荒木貞夫，是一個窮兵　武的標準日本軍閥，一九三一年曾任陸軍總監部總務局長，一九三一年十二月就任犬養內閣的陸相，策動東北事變。據荒木在國際法庭供稱：「本人就任陸相後，即為解決滿洲問題，研究佔領四省政策，因　首相，外相及藏相之贊同，決定由首相徵求樞密院之承認。內閣乃決議「平定」張學良之領土！」其陰謀可見。</p>
<p>在齊藤內閣時，荒木繼任陸相，一九三二年主持簽訂日「滿」議定書。是項會議，日皇裕仁亦曾親自出席。</p>
<p>一九三三年陞任陸軍大將，一九三四年至一九三六年任最高軍事參議官，翌年任內閣對華顧問委員會顧問官，公然干涉我國內政。在近衛內閣及平沼內閣時出任文相，把持一切，其權力高於首相，儼然為日本法西斯領袖之一。一九四〇年又任內閣顧問官。</p>
<p>荒木不獨是一個極端的仇　者，並為反蘇之最有力份子。　一九一八年至一九二二年日本干涉遠東時，他主持着遠東蘇聯境內的間諜工作。</p>
<p>盟軍在日本登陸後，荒木與島田等同時被麥帥下令逮捕在國際法庭開審時，已訊明荒木過去侵略東北以及內蒙，華北的種種罪行，預料不久即可定　。</p>
<h3>百戰敗星　畑俊六</h3>
<p>日本著名軍閥，大多數曾在東北担任過　務，畑俊六也是崛起於「東北軍閥系」中的一員。早年畢業於陸軍士官學校，擅「統劍術」，一九三三年在東三省担任師團長，一九三五年任陸軍航空局長。日本二·二六政變後，寺內壽一負責出來肅軍，荒木貞夫下台，柳川平助繼長陸軍，畑氏與柳川本係陸大同學，乃得被任為台灣軍總司令官。從此一帆風順，兩度被派來華，任派遣軍總司令。</p>
<p>畑俊六在國際法庭上供稱：「本人繼松井大將後，自一九三八年二月至十一月任華中派遣軍總司令，又繼西尾大將後，自一九四一年至一九四四年任中國派遣軍總司令。松井攻陷南京後，本人乃以攻略地域之「和平」工作為主要目的。</p>
<p>畑俊六兩度來華指揮作戰，遭遇着我軍猛烈的抵抗，受到鉅大的損失，乃唆使部下軍人，到處殺戮我國民衆，藉以洩憤。在黃河，在長江，在華中，在華南，中國民衆的大流血，造成歷史上慘酷無比的一頁。</p>
<p>在畑俊六兩度來華的時間，一度曾改任阿部內閣的陸相。派西尾壽造大將來華作戰，發動所謂「十月攻勢」，以七師團兵力，猛撲長莎，誰知深入受困，大敗於幕阜山下，死亡過半，西尾因此免職，而畑氏亦不得不解陸相職務。</p>
<h3>雙重戰犯　鈴木貞一</h3>
<p>這次在聯合國國際法庭受審的鈴木貞一，是聯合國的雙重戰犯，發動過侵華戰爭，又參加　動太平洋戰爭，其罪行真是罄竹難書。</p>
<p>鈴木是日本少壯派中的一員急先　，一九三八年十二月來華，任興亞院政務處長，才呢過代理該院總務長，直至一九四一年四月興亞院解散為止。</p>
<p>興亞院取消後，鈴木返國，從一九四一年至一九四三年一月，連任近衛內閣及東條內閣中企劃院總裁　無任所大臣，參與策動對英美戰爭。一九四四年又任內閣顧問官，及大政翼贊會理事，勝利後自首下獄。</p>
<h3>日本侵略戰爭代價</h3>
<p>據第一次及第二次復員委員會最近調查報告：日本在八年侵略戰爭中，喪失軍事人員一·一七四·四七六人，內陸軍人員七七七·〇七六人，海軍人員三九七·四〇〇人。陸軍死亡人員中，計陣亡者七二五·〇七六人，溺歼者五二·〇〇〇人，海軍死亡人員中，死於中國戰區者二八〇人，死於太平洋戰區者，三九七·一二〇人。（聯）</p>

<h3>上海證券市場籌備經過與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 杜鏞</p>
<p>卅五年夏，政府當局鑒於上海市投機風行，遊資無正當途徑歸納，爰有籌設上海證券市塲之決意，於六月初，由財經兩部，會聘王志莘顧善昌兪寰澄徐寄廎徐維明瞿季剛夏屛芳錢永銘及本人共九人，爲上海市證券交易市塲籌備委員會委員，並指定本人爲主任委員，王志莘君爲副主任委員，郎於四日成立，召開首次會議，為集思廣益，分工合作起見，分設「規定及審查經紀人資格」，「規定上市證券標準，並審定上市證券」，「釐訂有關證券交易各項章則」，「籌備證券交易所復業一切有關事項」各小組委員會。除由委員分別參加外，並延聘各專家爲顧問，其工作經過略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於經紀人之申請，登報公告，自七月九日，開始辦理，至廿一日截止，先由小組審查，再提出全體會議，根據學力經歷資力三項，核其證件，與平時信譽，行莊等組織，及其現狀，詳加注意，以為準則，數度會議，方行竣事，備具名單，連同證件，分呈財經兩部核定。</p>
<p>（二）上市證券之審查，先以公告方式，開始接受升請，　田小組會，按其資負表册，登記手續，以及其他有關事項，逐條審核，經全體會議決定，轉呈核準。</p>
<p>（三）證券交易各項規則之　定，以中外各交易所現行章則，依據法令，參酌滬市情形，由小組會章擬，送請全體會議決，　呈核定，務使不悖法令，切合事實，一方提高證券從業之水準，一方顧到制止投機之原則。</p>
<p>（四）證券交易所，本有上海華商存在，敵僞時期，雖亦利用，惟資本範圍，均甚微細，故委員會奉令籌備市塲，並即籌設上海證券交易所，資本定爲十億元，華商舊股東認十分之六，其餘由中交中農中信郵匯等行局承受，以舊有華商之市塲，擴充改建，成爲債券股票兩市塲，樓下開做股票，隔棋開做債券，三樓爲辦事處所。</p>
<p>復以部令早日復業，期迫事繁，排除困難，於九月三日召開上海證券交易所發起人會，宣吿設立，籌委會工作及使命，至此吿一段落，嗣後即移交該所辦理，本人忝主籌委會事，自奉令籌備起，至上海證券交易所成立爲止，前後共經三月，仰賴宋院長指導有加，一切工程章則審核各項事務，經各委員之努力，此中國唯一之證券交易市塲，幸吿厥成，此其籌備經過也，證券之與金融，關係至切，利害相繫，允以近世金融業務，發展更爲明顯，吐納之方法旣簡，保管之手續允便，進而至於國債之募集，通貨之伸縮，於國家財政經濟，亦復加重其間接之關係，以故各國對於證券市場，莫不重視，誠以其組織是否嚴密，管理是否完備，在在可以影饗金融之健全，間接可以影響政府經濟政策之推進，故其所負之使命及責任，至重且鉅，我國之有證券，首以滬市爲發源，由個人進而至於集團組織，再進而成立證券市塲，亦以滬市比較完備，蓋以上海爲全國金融重心，利用此市塲，亦最需要，故自民國八年起，至二十六年，前華商證券交易所之市塲，承納公債，數逾億萬，惟是證券市塲，其重要性，不僅在於債券之銷納，更須推進工商業股票之流通，國人以前投資股票之觀念，類皆親友情而關係，主持者又復囿於門戶之見，會計稽核制度，亦未臻完善之境，故其組織範圍，不　擴大，而股票流通，不易招人信任，現時工商企業，資本總額，動輒億萬，組織日趨完密，而會計力求準確，招股之風，亦蛻變而爲公開，此次上海證券交易所之設立，依法備具手續，申請上市者，亦復踴躍，一方投資股票者，日益衆多，可見社會人士之觀念興趣，均已改換，而證券市塲股票部份之成立，實爲當務之急，故當前之瞻望，投資者審愼選擇，以決定其取捨，主持者坦白精勤，以推廣其業務，而交易所允應以不徇不阿之態度，嚴格執行其法規，務使誘掖投資，而防止投機，俾債券股票之流通無阻，三方各盡其職，吾國證券市塲之前途，當可漸臻完備矣。</p>
<h3>致上海證券交易所同人書</h3>
<p>— 王志莘</p>
<p>上海證券交易所奉令籌備後，本人追隨杜主任委員並得諸同人協力工作之下，得見今日正式開幕。茲復謬承，杜理事長之推聘，兼代總經理職務，獲有機會與多數在過去不相識之全體同人，共事一堂，至感愉快！</p>
<p>證券交易所爲金融部門重要機構之一。其任務在建立現代資本市塲，以導引社會資金投入正途。以輔助國家經濟建設，與發展工商企業。是以責職綦重，其成敗得失，影響至鉅。本人一向致力銀行事業，對於交易所業務，素爲隔閡，肩茲巨任，深凜履霜堅冰之懼，而不得不寄厚望於全體同人</p>
<p>同人將以木所爲終身職務，苜先必須認淸本所之使命，進而健全吾人服務本所之觀念。過去社會上對於交易所目的，不無誤解投資爲投機，祗知利已幸獲，罔顧社會影響者。從業人員，耳濡目染，亦往往誤用職務上之便利，隨波逐流，從而誤認服務本所爲已取得有利地位者。此種錯誤觀念，希望隨時間以俱逝。吾人應以個人之榮辱與利害，聯繫於服務機關之興替。際此本所新生之初，吾人必須在心理上，奠定崇高純潔之服務信念。</p>
<p>吾人旣在本所服務，即應　遵本所紀律，盡忠各人職守，同人當能曉喩斯旨，不待闡釋。但如何養成守紀律，負責任之優良風尙，則當自嚴肅生活做起。惟有生活嚴肅者，其心理始能健全，其才能始有進步。亦惟心理健全者乃能守紀律，才能不斷進步者。乃能負責任。此點則必待同人體會力行，本人必以身作則，同時本人對於本所同人生活安定上應有之措施，必視力之所及逐步推行同。人中有一部份係借重前華商證券交易所之從業人員，另一部份係經考選，或向各方羅致而來。俱有多年服務社會之歷史，對於本職，必能勝任愉快，以如此整齊之陣容，經營本所有意義之事業，相信決不負政府及社會之屬望。但同人間必須上下戮力，和衷共濟，允須泯除新舊之分，畸城之見，始克有成。此則希望同人應予特別警惕者。</p>
<p>本所同人，雖來自各方，而取捨則絕對以才能爲準。其在服務過程中，則以工作表現與服務道德，爲淘汰與升遷之準繩。凡工作成績優良而生活嚴肅者，本所必保證其得安於其位，久於其任，如不此之圖，惟冀求苟安於人事關係中者，事實必將吾定之。蓋用人惟選賢與能，將爲本所一貫方針也。</p>
<p>本所組織暫定分設一室四處。即秘書室，業務處，財務處，調査硏究處，及事務處。各處分設各科，全體同人，分佈於各部份工作，聯合形成一有機體。各人所負之責，雖有重輕，而各別應完成其任務之重要性，初無軒輊。務望各據崗位，盡其在我，協力同心，以推進本所事業，臻於至善。</p>
<p>本人與同人共事伊始，爰述幾點希望，願共勉之！</p>

<h3>為上海證券交易所開幕　謹致各界同胞書</h3>
<p>— 杜鏞</p>
<p>各界同胞公　　鄙人奉宋院長曁經財兩部長官之命，與上海市證券交易市塲籌備委員會諸君籌設上海證券交易所，歷時三月有餘，籌備工作大體就緒，業已依法召集股東會，選任理監事，鏞不才，承推任理事長，汲深緶短，時虞隕越，今日開幕，謹掬吾感想，以就正於各界同胞。</p>
<p>本所此次開幕，所負使命異常重大，良以國家經多年抗戰，百廢待興。各項建設，最重要者爲資金之籌集，而籌集資金之法，在吾國經濟國策之下，無如經由現代證券市塲，以發行證券方法吸集遊資，以買賣證券方法運用遊資。必如此，企業家方能運用社會資力，以增加其生產力；必如此，投資人方能量其資力與需要，選購證券，並得隨時出售，不患呆滯，本所之設，即爲適應此兩方之需要，對建國大業有所貢獻，此其一</p>
<p>目前社會遊資泛濫，苦無正當出路。投機狂潮，物價波動。接踵而起，影響國民生計至深且鉅，本所開業以後，希望能銷納遊資，引導投入正當企業，市面金融得臻穩定，小民生計得解倒懸，此其二。</p>
<p>本所此次開業，對經紀人資格及上海市證券之審定均極嚴格，內部組織及人選亦極鄭重，各項章則妥愼釐訂，設備規模，獨步逮東。今後在嚴密管理，正確領導之下，希望能恪遵政府法令，確立現代資本市塲機構。從而推行國策，補益財政，此其三。</p>
<p>以上三者爲本所之使命，顧言之匪艱，行之維艱。其完成也，一方固恃本所同人之努力，一方允賴各界人士匡助。登高自卑，行遠自邇。開幕伊始，不勝臨深履簿之懼。苟能以各界同胞之愛護玉成，獲致燦爛之前途，則非特本所之幸，亦國家社會之　也。上海證券交易所理事長杜鏞敬啓卅五年九月九日</p>
<h3>如何健全上海證券交易所市場</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>距一七七三年七月十五日倫敦證券交易所成立之一百七十三年，而我上海證券交易所亦以準備就緒，宜吿開業聞。則距民國八年上海證券物品交易所之成立，又廿七年矣，其間交易所事業波折之多，證券市塌變化之繁，以及工商企業界盛衰起伏之迹，偶一回憶，感慨無窮。而以當前工商業危機之深，資金流於黑市高利貸之亟，證交適於此時大張旗鼓，開業應市，吾人誠不能不加以深切之注意。其章程第一條苜揭其業務之宗旨曰，『提倡企業投資，促進經濟復員，建立健全證券市場，扶助工商企業』。所見者遠，深獲吾心。然必須其建立之證券市塲能够得上健全，而後企業投資方可提倡，工商企業才能扶助，經濟復員乃得促進。故要言不煩，證交之爲證券市塲，宜如何講求其健全，而後乃能於社會有利，於股東有益。不能不貢獻吾人之意見。</p>
<p>一曰父易手續必須規律化證券市塲非必交易所也。自有證券，即有其交易。而一般交易手續有危害市塲，妨礙社會之虞。乃制定交易所法，設交易所以集中之，範圍之，務求買賣及交割之手續，能符合法理，適於商情。交易所制度，蓋以法治之精神，糾正交易上之苟且及其他弊害者也。硏究交易所制度者，每盛稱英國。以其開創最早業務最發達，而法治精神又最美滿，然每讀交易所史，自一五六七年Roya</p>
<p>Exchange以還，交易手續亦屢經整飭。及阿母斯多登技術傳入，定期交割施行，獨未能入於正軌。而每値投機猖獗，興論仍多指摘，一六九七年議會且立嚴法以取締之，旋又甄別經紀人，剔除敗類。Change　Alley馬路交易之奔放，與我國一般弄堂買賣相較，其不易管制，可謂東西一轍。凡讀Centive夫人一七一七年所著戲曲“A.　Bald　Strake　fora　Wife”者，當有不少之回味。直至一七七三年倫敦證券交易所成立於Sweeting's　Alley，始有具體之經紀人公會，及健全之交易制度。於是交易手續漸入正軌，而有一八〇一年Capel　Court交易所新建築物之成立。然猶不斷的改進務求交易手續之嚴格紀律化。彼先進國交易所制度之有今日之成就，其經過蓋如是。吾國之有交易所歷史尙淺。上海曾經淪陷，黑市交易之種種缺點及不道德，應如何一新其面目，誠非易事。然苟捨此不圖，則基礎不立，後患堪虞。但諺云知難不難，要在不斷改進。</p>
<p>二曰交易目的物必須穩妥化證券之種類甚多，何者乃爲有益於企業投資，有助於經濟復員，有效於扶助工商業，則必須以遠大眼光，中正之立塲，從統計上求得其標準。然後劣者不得逞，優者乃得興。吾人於此，又不能不憶及英國矣。當一六九〇年代，股票雖有發行，而未能大量流通。其後之一百餘年間，現代化之企業漸多，股票投資漸盛，而交易所交易，亦漸集中於此。其於國內生產事業之推進，蓋與汽機工業之興起互爲表裏也。然股票市塲，究不免屢經風波。多方空方，曾爲起落，犧牲亦不在小。其南洋諸公司股票之在漲與暴跌，曾備遭輿論之制裁。一七三三年且立法嚴禁投機。可見交易目的物選擇一有不愼，其危險有如此者。吾國交易所史雖淺，而股票風潮迭起。吾人當不能忘懷淸季之橡皮股票，及民十左右之本所股事件。主持證交者，當知所警惕。至於公債則債信尙待加强，而流通必須促進。以吾國財政之匱乏，如捨公債而一味注重於增稅與發鈔，當非善策。則爲整個國族着想，交易所之於公債交易，自不可不盡力。然本年六月底之公債風潮，何人應負其責。袪其弊而立其信，遇有操縱情事，交易所當本不偏不倚之精神，予以嚴正之糾正。</p>

<h3>證券同業公會整理之經過</h3>
<p>— 敬之</p>
<p>本市證券業同業公會，於去年十一月間，奉社會局令，依法整理先後委派陳永靑莫杏林周午三富渭元諸慕眞朱泰耀阮公純等七人爲整理委員，互推陳永靑爲常務委員，着手登記會員，草擬章程，呈奉社會局核准於本年二月二十四日召開第一屆會員大會，通過章程，選舉理監事，計選出杜月笙兪明時莫杏林周午三陳永靑兪明岳林樂耕兪寰澄蘇佩玿周漢卿王叔和林宗靖史久裁魏梅章裘良圭等十五人爲理事，鄭筱舟董萊蓀朱嗚玉吳仕森阮公純富渭元鄭學誥等七人爲監事，當塲就職，並於三月一日，舉行第一次理事會，推定杜月笙兪明時王叔和莫杏林史久裁等五人爲常務理事，嗣以杜氏因病辭職，於三月二十八日第二次理事會議，議決准辭，補選兪寰澄爲常務理事，並於常務理事中，互選俞寰澄爲理事長，各整理委員即行移交，所有該會會員，截至最近止，計五一七名，其中當選經紀人者，聞有九七名云。</p>
<h3>偽證交的黑幕</h3>
<p>— 舊人</p>
<p>上海證券交易所今日正式開幕了，我們回想到過去偽證交時代的重重黑幕，令人不寒而慄，在幾位常務理事領導之下，上行下效，極盡敲詐之能事，證券上市事前旣須先向常務理事運動，出到了相當代價，始得取得上市擢，（例外者僅十之一二），經過一重敲詐，尙還不算，又須向場務科以重利買通，（現金之外並有贈股派股等方式），吾則這一家廠商的股票，就有被束高閣之虞。（懸牌於市塲兩側擱樓之上，）因爲那處地位，賣買不便，日子一久，便有成爲冷股或霉股之可能，那時候只要看那一只股票，由冷僻之處喬遷到熱鬧或正中的地位，這一只股票必定有所作爲，同時在這只股票的牌子前，必定擁有大量的檯面帮，（搶帽子的小投機份子，）和塲務科員或所中其他職員，說到檯面帮，眞是神通廣大，僞所明明規一定每一經紀人祇准派代理人二名入塲，毫無通融餘地，但是這輩檯面帮，却自由出入於重重門禁，檢問森嚴的市塲之門，而且正當的代理人，往往遭受塲務科人員無理的欺凌，反讓檯面帮暢所欲爲，佔盡上風，無非是錢能通神罷了。</p>

<h3>上海證券交易市場沿革及其業務變遷概略</h3>
<p>— 陳續孫</p>
<p>上海證券之有交易，實開始於淸季。初僅一二號家代理外埠買賣，其後從業者逐漸增加，惟各自爲政，囿於小見，浸至橡皮風潮，股票信譽，幾近掃地。迨至民國初年，乃由同業組織股票商業公會，訂立會章，互相連絡，業務日趨發展，種類亦日漸繁多，與外界之聯繫亦日形密切，各方情况，亦不容長此墨守閉關辦法；爰於民國八年發起組織上海華商證券交易所股份有限公司，資本三百萬元，九年五月領到部照，設置經紀人，開始純粹證券市塲交易；上海證券交易之有正式市塲，常以此爲嚆矢。惟爾時交易所蠭起雲湧，政府亦未頒佈統一法令，以致每日行市，各行其是，參差不一；次年遇信交風潮，各業交易所倒閉者甚多；幸蹬券支特者及時應付，此方在萌芽之事業，幸免於外來之襲擊，而仍不免稍有近閱，股本改爲一百萬。嗣後數年，以政治之不安定，內亂時作，齊魯戰爭，奉直戰爭，九六風潮，直接間接，影響於證券市塲之存在；直至北伐完成，十八年頒佈交易所法及施行細則，而後交易所始有法規以資準繩。按法規定每一區域每一交易所以每一種類爲限，經營同種類者，限期合併，是時上海經營證券市塲者，尙有一證券物品交易所，依法應爲合併，直至二年五月，該所之證券部份歸併於上海華商證券交易所，資本改爲一百二十萬元；其他部份，按照種類先後，分別歸併於各專營之交易所，從此上海證券市塲依法合一，所有行市，亦不復有參差。翌年改建房屋，設置國內唯一之完備證券市塲，公司信譽，日漸增强，交易數字，亦日有增加。此後經過九一八事變，一二八事變，債價慘落，均曾短期停市，旋即恢復。廿六年八一三日寇攻滬，即於是日宣吿停業。同時奉部令籌備遷漢，於十一月派員赴漢，成立籌備處，迄未成立市塲。直至卅四年勝利後，該所內部從事整理，同時感覺證卷市場與國家金融政策，上海金融組識，關係至切。在二十六年春，原擬增加資本，由各銀行投資，以謀緊密合作；不幸戰事驟作，未能實現；爲貫澈舊有王張起見，乃於卅五年春，由財政部經濟部會聘委員九人，籌備組織上海證券交易市塲；股票債券，分別經營，重行組織交易所，定名爲上海證券交易所。資本定爲十億元，除華商證券交易所投資六億元外，其餘四億元，由國家行局承受。將原有市場擴充修建，爰於是年九月九日開始營業。此上海證券市場之沿革史略也。若再簡論其業務之變遷如左：</p>
<p>淸季尙未有公債發行，股票除外商所發行者外，華商股票僅有招商局漢治萍等數種。種類旣少，成交不大，民國肇興，工商組織，漸次加增，然資本大者，不超過數百萬元；股票數量，不過數萬股，除去董監等保存股外，即有流通，爲數極微，而主持者大率囿於舊習，不願予交易所以協助，遇有詢問，不得要領。投資者當其入股之初，即爲親友之介，對於組織之內容，亦漢然不相過問，故其個人經濟，絕不以其投資爲融通之工具；一方羞於公開委託，一方缺乏公定之價格，範圍日益狹，流通日益微；反之，外商機構，遇事公開，過戶便利，藉治外法權之庇護，成立衆業公所，種類不過二三十種，而每日成交數以鉅萬，資本外流，誠可扼腕！證券交易所自開辦而後，不斷努力，希望改變國人投資觀念，而所得結果，反遭疑忌。溯自民八直至民廿六，證券交易所市場成交證券，百分之九十八以上，均爲政府之各種公債。政府債信逐步堅强，債價逐步穩固，因而交易數量亦逐步加增。中日戰啓，政府西遷，上海畸形繁榮，工商組織新興者甚多；卅二年僞組織曾迫令重開市塲，專做本國公司股票，成交數量頗鉅，就交易所本身業務而論，確已打開我國人士舊有投資之積習，其轉捩亦不容忽視。上海證券交易所之成立，與金融界之關係旣更深切，而現時工商之組織手續，又較前完備，一切方式均行公開，而治外　權之取銷，衆業公所亦遂無形解體。此後投資者之選擇去從，自亦易於決定；，誘掖資本，納入正當途徑，當可逐步改進，而交易市塲在嚴密管理之下，遵循邁進，以求完成其使命，其工作實亦艱且鉅也。</p>

<h3>祝上海證交復業</h3>
<p>證券交易所，即是證券市場，證券是商品，即有買賣，有買賣，即有市塲，交易所道種組織，不過在此項市塲發展到某種程度時，國家予以相當的規定與名義而已。</p>
<p>本市的證交，在沒有依法組織以前，也已有了證券市塲，市塲在先，交易所在後，所以交易所的形式，雖在依法組織以後，方才具備，而交易所的實質，毋寗說是經濟上自然的產物，與法令並不相干。換句話說：在實質上的條件尙未具備時，雖經法令許可，或經人爲的策動，亦未必便能辦得起來。縱使勉强地辦了起來，亦未必便能持久。證交法令頒行已久，試看國內各大都市，能有幾處辦得起來？民國十·十一年間，信交事業狂熱時，　是上海一　，　　　　一　餘種名目，但是曾幾何時，　是曇花一現，一　不復再振，反一面說：專做華洋股票的衆業公所，並沒有得到我國政府的許可，但在一·二八，太平洋戰事發動以前；　始終還是生涯鼎盛，並不因法律上的條件不具備而减色。至於證交停業以後，各種證券的黑市市塲，直到最近，還沒有完全消滅。淪陷時期，敵僞機構施　淫威，濫拘濫罰，並禁止各報登載市價，勝利以後，禁令加嚴，連各該證券字號的電話也都割斷，但買賣還是買賣，市塲依然存在。可知這種市塲，在實質上的條件未備具時，談不到促進或漿　勵，在條件已經且備，事實上確有需要時，也無從嚴格禁止。</p>
<p>此次證交奉令改組，於今日重行復業，我們認爲這是當然的措置。因爲本埠證交市　的成立　　　　個　　　　實上也確有　　。如果採取　極政策，一　地嚴加禁，　非化公爲私，使這種非法的是市買賣，延長時日而已。</p>
<p>我們應當注意的是：這種市場，其投機性特別大，其奧一般金融，商業的影響，也就別重。所以對於這種經濟上　然的產物，到如今，還有一部份人抱　疑慮的態度，而當馬遲之又久，到最近，方才決定方針，也無非爲流弊太大，在事前，不得不予以審愼的緣故</p>
<p>改組後的情形，有幾點與從前顯然不同。（一）是提高資本額，改爲官商合辦，（二）是經紀會的審核，十分嚴格，（三）是證金特別提高，（四）是公債以外，很重股票，（五）是允許外商加入爲經紀人。（四）與（五），可說是適應時代的措施，（一）（二）（三），却是這次特別重要的改革。</p>
<p>不過根據過去經騐，凡是每一次的交易所風潮，總是由於人的問題居多，而由於法的問題較少。甚麼空頭集團，多頭集團，大戶拉提，某帮做手，乃至某種勢力爲背景等，歷來投機搗把，牽動大局，總不出這等人的圈套。對於此等人爲的風潮，按照過去監理制度的成績，顯然尙嫌不够。究應如何懲前瑟後，嚴密監察，以期納入軌道，安定市塲，似乎還値得愼重硏究。</p>
<p>有人以爲投機風潮，大都由期貨買賣所釀成，因而主張禁止期貨，限於現貨交易，道常然也是預防的一法而且是防止買空賣空的有效手段。不過交易所的職責，本在於平準市價，調劑金融。期貨交易的做開，未嘗無此等作用在內。雖其交易對象，是證券，不是物品，似乎沒有生產和到銷的關係，用不着一面購進原料，一面拋出製品，以求營業的安定。但金融界的酌盈劑虛，調整頭寸，要以有價證券的買賣最爲活絡。因此之故，我們對於單做現貨，禁做期間這一點，也認爲還有研究餘地。不過遠期交易，易滋流弊，確應加以限制。</p>
<p>由市場進展到交易所，這原是加强管理，嚴密組織的意思。最理想的組織，當然是凡所有流通的證券，和經營證券的商號，一齊包括在這個機構以內，方可以達到預期的目的，但這是事實上所不許可的。所以要杜絕投機，安定市面，實際上還須放眼到交易所以外。因爲這些塲外的種種因素，其力量不容輕視，有時或許要影響塲內，乃至牽動塲內，所以這個問題的重要性，並不在整頓內部以下。現在所已實行的，如通知股票公司停業，禁止掮客另闢黑市塲，不准利用或另裝對講電話之類，這都不失爲「攘外安內」的適當措施，但爲澈底的防弊起見，恐還須時刻警戒，再求進步。利之所在，往往嚴刑峻法，有所不顧。所以除掉消極的防閑以外，仍須顧到積極的疏導，以期減殺反動的力量。</p>
<p>抗戰八年，好容易得到的最後的勝利，更好容易得到證交的復業，瞻前顧後，願作芻　之獻。</p>
<h3>十年來證券行市之一般</h3>
<p>— 嘉猷</p>
<p>交易所事業，以上海最爲發達，然考我國成化最早之交易所，當推民七之北平證券交易所，其次爲民八上海證券物品交易所，當時上海早有股票商公會及上海衆業公所等組織，雖其範圍較小，而其組織及辦法均已隱具交易所之雛型。惟上海證券物品交易所成立之始，我國股份公司未曾發達，交易籌碼稀少故僅着重於交易所之本所股票，於助長企業，未能普遍發展。且彼時一般投機家均發交易所熱，相繼而起者，大有雨後春笋之象，統計當時各種交易所約達一百四十餘家之多，誠爲交易所之全盛時代，但當時經營者大都不依正軌而行，以致弊竇嚴生，對於便利買賣，扶持企業流通金融諸端喪失已盡，反釀成助長賭博風習，買空賣空，擾亂眞實市價，搖動市面安全，殊背設立交易所之眞旨，殆終遭「信交」風潮慘敗之後果，此固爲我國交易所史上之一段趣聞，實亦爲常今經營者之股鑒。</p>
<p>迨後政府頒佈交易所法，規定每一品類，在一區域僅以設立一個交易所爲限，證券物品交易所亦於民廿二年歸併於華商證券繁交易所，適政府發行公債，該所即以買賣公債爲限，撑持營業並限制不得以本所股爲交易，戢止投機，針對前疵，以是交易所之經營於政府監督下漸入常規，惟對扶助企業資金之公司股票，並未正式開拍，尙覺不够靈活金融市塲，且値抗戰軍興，該所又吿停業，於其發展上遭受一大打擊也。</p>
<p>敵僞控制上海後，濫發僞幣流通市上，一般人民咸以僞幣奄無貨幣價値可言，擁資者頗具戒懼，除百般設法囤積物資外，更紛紛組設公司，設立工廠及其他各種企業，股份公司漸見增多，股票買賣，頓成市塲，乃由僞府命今華商證券交易所復業，造成華商股票之非正式之市場，一部份投機者見於敵僞統制物資之嚴厲，乃移轉其投機目標於股票，且當時市塲對於政府發行之公使，列入禁令，洋商股票亦以具有敵性關係，同予禁止公開買賣，故於敵僞組織下之交易所全以華商股票爲其交易對象，但其時經營股票純爲投機目標，於工商企業之發展繁榮，絕無裨益，反更擾亂金融上之變動而已。</p>
<p>勝利一年來僞交易所早已停業，而華股買賣，雖無正式市塲，却已成爲一般投機者之對象，爰經社會賢達經濟權威曁工商碩彥之創導爲使游資納入正軌鼓勵生產繁榮市面並爲提倡企業、投資，促進經濟復員，建立健全證券市塲，扶助工商企業，經墨准財政經濟兩部恢復華商證券交易所，定期於本月九日正式開業，其營業種類，規定以（一）公債（二）公司債（三）股票，且聞股票係包括華股與洋股，均須經嚴格審査後，方可上市，則此後證券市場得可趨入正軌，當可預期。誠經濟復員中最具重大意義</p>
<p>茲就十年來證券黑市行情之變動狀况，分別列表於後，藉供參考。</p>

<h3>The National Army Advances Rapidly on All Fronts; The Siege of Datong is Imminent; Several Strongholds in the Suburbs have been Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 8th] The defending army of Datong telegraphed this morning to the responsible officials here that the strongholds north of the city, such as the railway station, alcohol factory, and flour mill, which were once lost, have been retaken. Furthermore, several small strongholds lost at the beginning of the fighting have also been recovered. Although the Communist army's attacks remain fierce and they continue to bombard the city with artillery, their siege forces seem to be gradually decreasing, possibly due to the critical situations in Jining and Fengzhen, where troops have been transferred for support. If Fu Zuoyi's troops make rapid progress, Datong may turn from danger to safety. The Communist army besieging Ying County south of Datong has been unable to capture it after a long siege, and has decided to breach the Hun River dike. The water level at the east gate of Ying County has reached shoulder height, and the entire city is in danger of being flooded. In other news, a certain unit of the National Army is crossing the Yellow River and heading north.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The defending army of Datong was pleased to hear that friendly forces advancing from the west had occupied Zhuozi Mountain. Today, they launched an attack from the city gates, and the Communist army's encirclement is gradually loosening. All parties here expect that the siege of Datong can be lifted by the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 8th] The battle for Datong continues to be fierce. The National Army is continuously reinforcing its troops, gradually stabilizing the situation. Xinhua News Agency's dispatch from Huairen on the 7th stated that refugees had fled from Datong city, clearly acknowledging that Datong had not been captured. Furthermore, the agency's dispatch from Zhangjiakou acknowledged that the Communist army in eastern Hebei had suffered setbacks in successive battles, with Xianghe being captured by the National Army on the 5th and Sanhe on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The Communist army previously entrenched at Zhuozi Mountain was the 358th Brigade, a core unit of He Long's forces. After the National Army moved in, 400 bodies were found on the northwest high ground alone. Currently, the Communist army is retreating in a southeast direction, and our cavalry has approached the outskirts of Jining City.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The Communist army launched a counterattack on Zhuozi Mountain from the night of the 5th to the morning of the 6th, abandoning 200 bodies before retreating. The political commissar of the regiment, Lu Zhengqi, and the battalion commander, Li Daming, defected. The Communist side had established a puppet Longsheng County in Zhuozi Mountain. After the National Army entered the city, it exempted all taxes and miscellaneous levies imposed by the Communist army and announced to self-cultivating farmers that they should no longer settle accounts with the poor, but resolve issues through legal means.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] Two hundred civil servants from Suiyuan Province are scheduled to depart from Guihua on the 7th, with their destinations being the four counties of Jining, Fengzhen, Xinghe, and Liangcheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guihua, 8th] After the National Army recovered Zhuozi Mountain, the Communist army in Datong has shown signs of wavering and has been actively reinforcing Jining, seemingly with the intention of advancing westward. In the battle of Zhuozi Mountain, most of the fortifications built by the Communist army were constructed using railway tracks, with some even using reinforced concrete, making them extremely solid. However, the National Army, with the assistance of the people, finally achieved victory.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Yan'an telegraphed today, acknowledging some of the victories won by the National Army.</p>
<p>Disposition of Communist Forces Attacking Datong</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] In the Datong area, after the railway station north of the city and the drill ground south of the city were successively controlled by the Communist army, the fighting has approached the city gates. The Communist army attacking the city has increased to over 60,000, willing to pay a heavy price in an attempt to seize Datong. The command headquarters here estimates the disposition of the Communist army attacking Datong as follows: The overall commander of the Communist army has been replaced by Xiao Ke, stationed at Jule Fort, 50 li east of the city. Under him are four regional command posts. Yao Jie is the commander of the eastern sector, stationed at Mapo Mountain, 10 li from the city, commanding the 32nd Brigade, the 10th, 11th, and 12th Field Armies, the 359th Brigade, the 1st Guerrilla Detachment, and the Yanggao Detachment, with approximately 17,500 troops on the front lines. The 1st Field Army and 1st Division are stationed in the Jule Fort 30 Li Fort area, with approximately 5,000 troops. The 109th Brigade is stationed near Yanggao, with approximately 1,500 troops (all Japanese).

<h3>The National Army in Eastern Hebei Advances Smoothly; Baodi and Yutian Recaptured Yesterday; The Baoding Pacification Troops Enter Rongcheng</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 8th] The National Army in eastern Hebei is making rapid progress. The troops that recovered Xianghe recaptured Baodi County this morning at 10:00 AM. The National Army advancing from Tangshan also recaptured Yutian. The two forces from the east and west will soon meet in this triangular area. This eastern Hebei mop-up operation is divided into four routes, taking an encircling formation. One route started from Tong County east of Beiping, recapturing Xianghe, Sanhe, and Baodi in recent days, and is now advancing towards Jixian and Zunhua. Another route started from Tangshan, advancing along two routes, east and west. The eastern route recaptured Leting and now controls the central area of the western area. Another route advanced southwest from Shanhaiguan, recapturing Lulong yesterday. Another route recaptured Xifengkou from outside the pass, blocking and sealing off the area. Since the operation began last week, seven cities have been recovered. Li Yunchang's forces, which had dominated eastern Hebei, are on the verge of collapse, and the Beining Railway can be kept safe.

The "Eastern Hebei Administrative Office" in Zunhua and the "14th Special District Office" in Yutian had already left. The defection of Zhu Zhankui, deputy commander of the 14th Military Sub-district of the Communist army in eastern Hebei, and his troops has dealt a great blow to the Communist army, as he led troops from Gubeikou to reinforce the area but defected to the National Army midway.

After the commemorative week ceremony, President Chiang addressed all the participating representatives, stating in brief: The Republic of China has been established for 5,000 years and has its own excellent civilized tradition. All of our citizens and youth should not neglect it in the slightest, and even more so, they should not violate the inherent morality of our country for 5,000 years and blindly follow foreign countries, rely on foreign countries, neglect our country's inherent culture and morality, and willingly become spiritual slaves to foreign countries, promoting the destruction of our country's culture and morality. Those who rely on foreigners and are manipulated by foreigners will have no future. It must be understood that the Kuomintang and the Youth Corps have an inseparable relationship, and they cannot blame each other and shirk responsibility. They should cooperate closely and intensify efforts to build a new China. Today's address lasted for over an hour, and all participants were deeply moved after listening to it.

We call on the youth of the whole country to participate in this Corps, and we will never use rights and status as a means of inducement. In the past, the general public in our country regarded taking office and becoming an official as the only way out for their children. This kind of concept must be broken. Youth who participate in this Corps should all aspire to engage in grassroots construction and social reform work to serve as a model for the youth of the whole country. At present, the obstacles to our party's revolution have not yet been eliminated, and the work of national construction is extremely difficult. We should promote our country's traditional national spirit and morality, become stronger despite setbacks, be indomitable, advocate benevolence and love, unite sincerely, and jointly seek thorough reform and active development of party and corps affairs, so as to promote the glorious history of our party in the past. As for the scope of work and cadres of the party and the corps, they can be properly divided so that the Youth Corps can truly become a youth organization that is owned, managed, and enjoyed by the youth.</p>

<h3>The Government Decides to Transfer all Japanese Industries to Private Management; The China Textile Industries Corporation's Factories Will Gradually be Transferred to Private Management within Two Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] The National Government, in order to overcome the stagnation of product exports, has ordered the Central Trust Bureau to purchase all silk produced in the country and is considering taking similar action for other major products such as tung oil, tea, and bristles.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu Speaks to Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu met with the reporter of United Press Agency and said: This move is equivalent to subsidizing important products because the government sells them to various countries at a price lower than the purchase price. Currently, silk production is slightly over 1,000 dan, only a small portion of the pre-war production. High cost of living, transportation difficulties, and high wages are the three major obstacles to China's economic recovery. Silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also hesitant and dare not develop their businesses. The government has no choice but to take action. Purchasing tea will also result in losses. Tung oil is better, only bristles can offset the losses. In order to continue efforts to stabilize the economy, the government intends to transfer all Japanese industries to private management before September 30th, except for heavy industries, because of their large scope and the need for government management, such as the textile industry. The China Textile Industries Corporation's yarn factories will be transferred to private management or sold shares one by one within two years. The value of the remaining Japanese industries to be transferred to private management in the Shanghai area alone is US$500 million. Industrialists who suffered losses during the wartime relocation will be given priority. If these industries are not sold after two auctions, there are three other ways to acquire them: (1) Immediate payment, calculated at 70% of the assessed value; (2) Installment payments without discounts; (3) Lease for two years, with interest calculated at the assessed value of percentage point paid, and the stipulation that the lessee must purchase it when the lease expires. In Shanghai, 40 factories are handled according to the first method, and 100 factories are handled according to the second method. The government also hopes to return the factories forcibly occupied by the Japanese to their original owners within the month. The improvements made by the Japanese in the equipment of the forcibly occupied factories will be sold to the original owners according to a plan of repayment over two years without interest. The China Textile Industries Corporation has 1.7 million spindles, and two-thirds of them are already in operation. It is hoped that all of them will be in operation within the year. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also takes a "firm stand" on the increase of labor. Unless the number of employees is expanded and it is beneficial to the general labor, the Ministry of Economic Affairs opposes further increases in labor. In order to prevent the "soaring" of rice prices, the government is now considering storing one year's worth of grain. The price of rice is currently trending downward due to the bumper harvest. As for land reform, the government must seriously consider it sooner or later, but it will not take drastic measures for the time being.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Operations to Conclude Next Autumn; Review Meeting Concludes Successfully Yesterday; Li Zhuomin Reports on Attending the UNRRA General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The four-day UNRRA work review meeting officially concluded at 5:00 PM on the 8th, with extremely satisfactory results. The most noteworthy event at today's meeting was the report by Deputy Director Li Zhuomin of the UNRRA China Office. Mr. Li had just returned from Geneva after attending the Fifth UNRRA General Assembly and provided a very detailed report on the proceedings. In his speech, Mr. Li announced that by the end of March next year, the budget UNRRA will allocate to China will not be less than US$562.5 million, plus maritime freight and the maintenance costs of foreign technical personnel, totaling over US$700 million. This matter was guaranteed by UNRRA Director General Fiorello La Guardia. Regarding the deadline for UNRRA's material assistance to China, the UNRRA Central Committee had considered three months ago that ending it by the end of March next year would be too hasty. The General Assembly decided that the deadline for purchasing and selling some UNRRA materials in China could be extended beyond the end of March, meaning that UNRRA could still supply materials to China after that date. Another issue was the deadline for the end of UNRRA's operations in China. Regarding this, La Guardia told Mr. Li that the current orders might not arrive until August or September next year, so the termination date had not been decided. Mr. Li believes the period will be in the fall of next year. As for the deadline for the work of foreign technical personnel, China also advocates extending it beyond the end of March next year, and the United States has agreed.</p>
<p>Following this, Director-General Jiang Tingfu delivered a speech, stating that based on the various decisions of the UNRRA General Assembly, the end date for UNRRA operations will be in August or September next autumn. Regarding the working period, I (Jiang referring to himself) do not hope for excessive extension, as UNRRA is a temporary organization. Health affairs should be handled by the Ministry of Health, and agriculture should be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The sooner the government takes over these tasks, the better, and extension is not a good thing. Mr. Jiang also stated that US$562 million in materials is equivalent to three times China's annual imports before the war, and our responsibility is significant. We should put more effort into transportation and distribution. After the speech, each subgroup reported on the opinions on the proposals reviewed in the afternoon of the 7th, and the fourth session of the General Assembly did not adjourn until around 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony of the review meeting was held at 3:30 PM. Liu Hongsheng delivered a training speech, followed by Director-General Jiang delivering the closing address, briefly stating that we have only completed one-third of the work, and two-thirds of the work remain to be done. He hoped that the materials could be transported before this time next year, but he urged the directors of each branch office to pay attention to preventing the materials from being embezzled. Finally, he added words of comfort for the hard work of the colleagues in each branch office, acknowledging that this work is worthy of the country and friendly nations. After the speech, Yu Jichuan, director of the Hunan branch office, delivered a reply on behalf of all present, followed by the passing of a telegram of respect to the chairmen, and the General Assembly adjourned in enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>According to Director-General Jiang, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight. The transportation contract between UNRRA and Chennault's airline will be signed after approval by the government. It is also heard that Deputy Director Li is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow, and the other branch office directors will also return to their respective locations one after another in the coming days. As for UNRRA's exchange of grain with the Ministry of Food, Director Shi has finalized the prices at the exchange locations and can negotiate with the Ministry of Food.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 8th] The Xiang, E, and Gan Investigation Team issued a public announcement at 3:00 AM this morning, uncovering a shocking corruption case involving the auction of materials at Jianghan Customs. The total amount of corruption is estimated to be at least 1.2 billion yuan. The announcement, which is 20,000 words long, lists the facts and figures regarding suspected corruption and illegal activities, resembling an indictment. The main points are as follows: (A) The selling price in non-public auctions was even 30% lower than the auction floor price, such as with matches and sulfides; (B) The pricing of the auction and the release of goods were all handled by one person, the quantity of materials was arbitrarily reduced, the floor price was repeatedly lowered, and there were excuses of mildew to deliberately underestimate the value, such as with Japanese cigarettes; (C) The same items were auctioned at the same time, but the prices varied greatly, such as with white paper; (D) The buyers of each auction were Yonghe, Mingji, and a dozen other companies, and the same buyer would deliberately bid for the same item in several rounds, with the floor price gradually decreasing, showing that they had ulterior motives (numbers and examples omitted). In summary, the customs received a total of 3.3 billion yuan from 13 auctions of materials. Based on the precise estimate of the above-mentioned corruption, the loss is at least 1.2 billion yuan. The team has decided to send this case to the court for investigation and prosecution, and recommends that the authorities promptly revise the auction regulations.</p>

<h3>Congratulating the Opening of the First Session of the Municipal Council and Commemorating the Double Ninth Victory Day</h3>
<p>Today marks the one-year anniversary of the day when General Yasuji Okamura, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in China, formally surrendered to the Supreme Commander of our country. This is the most glorious victory anniversary in our nation's history and deserves our enthusiastic celebration. However, recalling the nation-building efforts of the past year, which have been disrupted by the Communist Party and have not progressed smoothly nor achieved any major successes, we are ashamed to face the martyrs of the war of resistance! On this glorious victory anniversary, we should start from today and make a great determination to build a new China with sweat and blood and preserve the splendid fruits of victory. As for the direction of future efforts, the first is to promote the democratization of politics. The Shanghai Municipal Council is specifically holding its first session today, which has profound significance, and all Shanghai citizens should attach great importance to it. The council is a representative body of the people, and all councilors are elected by the citizens and must represent the 3.5 million citizens of the city in their speech. Observing the motions put forward by the councilors, which have reached more than 310, it can be seen that all councilors will fully express public opinion on various municipal issues. Therefore, the opening of the Shanghai Municipal Council today is the beginning of the democratization of municipal administration in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the first commercial port in China and the cultural center of the country. The large population, the prosperity of commerce and industry, and the urgent need for municipal reform are all above those of other provinces and cities, and it is also a matter of concern to both China and foreign countries. In the post-war world, which has entered a new era of peace and democracy, the democratization of Chinese politics is not only a consistent demand of the entire country but also an expectation of friendly countries. However, the evolution of democratic politics has its own trajectory and must be allowed to develop naturally. At the beginning of its germination, it is necessary to pay attention to the cultivation and advocacy of democratic style. In Shanghai, after the city's restoration, the government actively prepared for the establishment of the municipal council. However, due to technical difficulties, the general election could not be completed overnight. Therefore, a temporary council was established first to give public opinion the opportunity to be heard, and the municipal authorities could also adopt the opinions provided by many social elites as much as possible for the sake of gathering ideas. However, this transitional method is only a temporary measure, so a general election was officially held soon. Well-known people from all walks of life actively participated in the election, and although some unsatisfactory things happened, it was still a good sign of the election atmosphere in a democratic country. If we want political democratization, we must learn as much as possible to cultivate the style of democratic politics. Empty calls for democracy will never bring democracy from the sky. Therefore, we have the following two expectations for the municipal council that opened today:</p>
<p>First, the most important condition for implementing political democratization is to cultivate a democratic style and attitude among the people. Although there were democratic ideas in Chinese political history very early, politicians in the past dynasties emphasized ritual governance rather than the rule of law, so there was no basis for democratic politics. If we want to talk about democracy today, we must first cultivate the democratic demeanor of the people and create a democratic tradition. The dissemination of this style depends on the advocacy of the councilors. Therefore, we hope that all councilors can set an example and have a democratic demeanor, and pay attention to their attitude when discussing various issues and debating with others. Furthermore, when speaking, they must also consider whether they can represent the opinions of the citizens. The so-called democratic politics is based on public opinion from the bottom up, and no pretense is allowed.</p>
<p>Second, all councilors come from all walks of life and are deeply aware of the hardships of the people's lives. As representatives of the people, they must speak on behalf of the people as much as possible. At the same time, they have also made various promises to the voters during the election, and it is hoped that they can fulfill them. Therefore, the proposals put forward by the councilors are inevitably complex. However, the municipal council itself is limited by time and technology. If it wants to present all proposals for discussion and allow each councilor to freely express their opinions, it will be impossible. Therefore, we advocate that the proposals of each councilor should be prioritized, and attention should be paid to their feasibility. The media can also assist from the sidelines to promote their realization. Conversely, if there is no focus, then opinions will be divided, discussions will be complicated, and the strength will be dispersed. It will be difficult to reach an agreement on any proposal, and even if it is passed by the General Assembly, it is difficult to hope that it will be implemented.</p>
<p>In short, the Municipal Council is a representative body of the people and has the task of supervising the government. Whether the Shanghai Municipal Council can play its role in reforming the municipal administration of Shanghai is a major test of the democratization of municipal administration in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Discussing Sports on Sports Day</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Today is the "Double Ninth," which is designated as Sports Day by the state. Let us first discuss the meaning and function of sports.</p>
<p>Before we blindly seek a future, we must first ask ourselves if we have a healthy body? Before we blindly encourage a comfortable life, we must first ask ourselves if we have hygienic habits? Before we blindly want to be a first-class power, we must first ask ourselves if we have a first-class physique?</p>
<p>The three essential elements that create a nation's life are: environment, culture, and heredity, with heredity being the most important. The nation's vitality is its military power, economy, and education, with education as the general hub. Education has three aspects: moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, with physical education as its foundation.</p>
<p>The term "physical education" is translated from the English term "Physical Education," meaning the education of the body. In today's holistic education era, some people question this term and want to replace "physical education" with "sports." However, before the word "sports" is widely adopted, it is still called physical education. Physical education itself is really not an end, but a method, a tool. Its meaning is a kind of education that uses the large muscle activity of the body as a tool to achieve educational goals. The word "activity" here refers to all organic activities, such as the thoughts and emotions in learning, and all learning responses to the environment.</p>
<p>The purpose of physical education should be in line with modern educational philosophy, educational purposes, and educational goals. The purpose refers to a broad and general trend toward the highest standard, which is higher than the goal, but not necessarily achieved immediately. The goal is analyzed from the purpose, indicating special points, easy to achieve, and a necessary stage to achieve the purpose. The purpose of physical education is to provide intelligent and capable leaders, excellent and reasonable environments, and suitable sports opportunities, so that individuals or groups can obtain healthy bodies, happy spirits, and sound social personalities in this situation. The goals of physical education should be (1) developing personal organic organization, (2) developing the skills of the neuromuscular organization, (3) developing good sports attitudes, and (4) developing moral behavior standards.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of new education in the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, physical education has always been mistaken for competitive sports, overemphasizing training to win medals and break records, only cultivating a few athletes, who often fight and quarrel during competitions; and those who are called athletes are rarely long-lived and mostly short-lived. Experts who mistake competitive sports for physical education should have the opportunity to watch the film "The Light of the Soviet Union" to know how people implement physical education. Some schools have physical education classes where teachers and students wear long clothes and shout one, two, one, two, without sweating a drop; in this way, the original purpose of physical education is lost. Even if we talk about athletes, compared with the Westerners, they have become nothing more than food sacks and wine bags. I remember in 1936, 139 athletes from our country participated in the Berlin World Games and were completely defeated! During the basketball game, our side had the opportunity to shoot 24 free throws, but we did not make a single one, which shows that not only is the technology inferior to others, but the physical quality is even inferior to others. In this case, how can we mechanize our national defense? Modernize our country?</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese six arts education is the three educations. Zheng Xuan said: "Shi is the master of the princes, who has virtue to teach the people; Ru is the protector of the princes, who has six arts to teach the people." This is much earlier than the West. Ancient Greek education emphasized body and mind. It was not until the rise of religious education in the Middle Ages that moral education (Soul) emerged, and the three educations were completed, which was much later than the six arts education in our country. The shooting and archery of the six arts is to promote the implementation of physical education, starting from personal physical training and then cultivating the basic skills of national defense; in individuals, it is "both civil and military talent," and in the country, it is "those who have civil affairs must have military preparations," implying safeguarding the country in health.</p>
<p>The music education in our country, which includes dancing with spoons and dancing with elephants, teaches rhythmic and harmonious sports training, which shows that the ancients always attached great importance to physical education. Football, the national sport of England, was invented in our country long ago, and was called Cuju in ancient times. Later, this game progressed to using horses as a substitute, and became today's polo. It can be seen in Tang poems and Song paintings. Chinese physical education attaches great importance to morality. The third chapter of the Analects of Confucius, "The Eight佾舞," records Confucius saying, "The gentleman does not compete for anything, but he must also shoot? He bows and ascends, and then descends and drinks, his competition is also a gentleman." And as Su Dongpo said, "Winning is certainly pleasant, and losing is also gratifying." The "sportsman spirit" of Westerners is our gentleman spirit, which is manifested everywhere in training discipline and morality in sports. If you move without talking about morality, it is easy to become brave and fight; this can produce two opposite extremes, one is to evolve into chaos, and the other is to despise physical education because of choking. The nation-state suffers a lot!</p>
<p>The disadvantage of emphasizing literature over military affairs is the separation of civil and military affairs. Once civil and military affairs are separated, not only is it difficult to know, but it is also difficult to act. The imperial examination began at the end of the Tang Dynasty, and civil and military affairs were separated from then on. By the Song Dynasty, it was even more unimaginable. The national health declined from this, and the culture also declined. The American psychologist Stanley Hall said, "The golden age of a culture must have a golden age of the body thirty years before." We can see that the strength of Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, the plumpness of Yang Guifei, and the fact that "Lady Guo rides a horse to enter the palace gate at dawn" show how martial a woman was. The palace maids at that time were also very healthy and mighty. There is Wang Jian's palace poem as proof: "The palace maids who shoot with bows wear red makeup, and each of them holds a new bow." At that time, the country was strong and prosperous. By the time of the second master of the Southern Tang Dynasty, it had fallen into disrepair. Since Li Houzhu "can't stand the cold in the fifth watch in the night," no wonder he wants to "sink his waist and wear his temples." Hua Rui, a demon woman at the beginning of the Song Dynasty, said that the demise of Meng Shu was: "140,000 troops disarmed together, and there was not a single man." By the time of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty, their bodies could not support it even before the alliance under the city. The Southern Song Dynasty was even more decadent, and Li Qingzhao described women as "thinner than yellow flowers," which shows their fragility and morbidity.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire country, it is enough to prove the consistency of health, martial arts, and culture. This is a historical lesson, which proves that culture cannot be separated from health and military affairs. When literature prevails over quality, there is a danger of national subjugation. What's more, our "literature" is far inferior to others! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I personally investigated the physiques of one million young men, the young people who applied for the Air Force from the tenth to the twentieth terms, and the students who applied for military academies in the tenth term. Only about 30% of them passed the physical examination, and only about 10% of those who passed the Air Force examination on average. However, sports men accounted for the majority. This is really enough for us to think deeply.</p>
<p>In the future, physical education must be implemented in a practical way. First, the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education should be strengthened. Now, two of the three standing committee members of the committee are said to be working in other places, and one is running around. How can they bear the important responsibility? Second, from the central government to the local governments, all physical education administrators must have knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm, and they must have aspirations for building the country. Third, quickly train a large number of school physical education teachers and mass physical education talents. Fourth, expand the public's sports fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other social sports activity venues as much as possible. Fifth, build and enrich school sports fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other sports equipment. Sixth, pay attention to mass and individual physical education on a daily basis. When holding sports meets, there should be more large-group physical education performances and fewer individual medal competitions. Look at our neighbors! Look at the defeated Japan, and look at the Soviet Union that won the Anti-Japanese War. What are their sports like? From here, we can measure our future, our life, and our country.

<h3>Adapting to the Needs of the Atomic Warfare Era; The US Navy Builds New Warships; Equipped with Rocket Launchers and Directional Explosives; The Third Atomic Bomb Test Indefinitely Postponed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th Broadcasting: Naval warfare has entered a revolutionary new era. Two new US warships have been equipped with radio-controlled bombs. At the same time, official reports also confirmed that the US has designed and manufactured two atomic warships to resist atomic bomb attacks, one is the "Kentucky" battleship with a displacement of 45,000 tons, and the other is the "Hawaii" cruiser with a displacement of 27,000 tons. These two warships were produced after this atomic bomb test.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The United States is currently building the first batch of warships of the atomic age. The ships are equipped with rocket multiple launchers to replace the old-fashioned cannons. The Navy Department announced that the 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,000-ton battle cruiser "Hawaii" will be equipped with directional explosives. The two ships were originally planned according to the old design. At the end of World War II, rockets and atomic bombs appeared, opening a new era. The two ships were redesigned. Navy designers informally stated that long-range directional bombs can be fired using radio waves, or the steel and heat of the target itself can be used to attract the bombs. However, the plan to equip the rocket with an atomic bomb warhead is still under study.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] In recent weeks, the United States' policy towards the Soviet Union has become increasingly tough, especially with the development of the Paris Peace Conference and the American South incident. However, the possibility of armed conflict is not credible, because there are still many political and external security measures that can be tried. The United States' shift to a tougher attitude towards Moscow seems to be supported by the domestic people, and some experts believe that the growth of public sentiment is even faster than the official.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman issued an order today to indefinitely postpone the third atomic bomb test, which was scheduled to be held next spring, saying that in the near future, the knowledge that can be obtained from deep-sea tests is not worth the cost. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, the postponement is not a cancellation, but only an indefinite postponement. Truman made this decision on the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army and Navy Department, and the Atomic Bomb Test Evaluation Committee. It is said that scientists and military experts have been able to estimate the effectiveness of the Chenzi bullet based on the knowledge gained from previous tests. The General Staff is "very satisfied" with the results of the two tests.</p>
<h3>Where Does the Soviet Union Intend to End Up? - Secretly Researching Atomic Energy - Actively Manufacturing Tanks and Cannons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 7th] An American expert on Soviet affairs, recently arrived from the Soviet Union, revealed that throughout the Soviet Union, secret institutes and laboratories for the research of atomic energy are densely distributed, overseen by the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, former People's Commissar for Internal Affairs, Beria. The American expert stated that his information was obtained from extremely reliable sources, saying that the Soviet government is sparing no expense in research funding, in order to realize Molotov's previous statement that "We, too, shall have the atomic bomb." He added that Soviet scientists have already learned most of the principles of nuclear fission.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The "Daily Mirror" today accused the Soviet Union of manufacturing tanks, cannons, airplanes, and rocket bombs in factories in Germany. It stated: Soviet actions are evidenced by secret documents, and its intentions are likely to be fear of attack. At this moment, the United Kingdom and the United States should resolutely take action, forcing the Soviet Union to reveal the truth before the situation becomes unmanageable.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Tank Day</h3>

Attlee has already announced concrete plans to recruit young talent into the Cabinet to make it more dynamic. However, the recent situation has become difficult, and left-wing members of the Labor Party are strongly criticizing Foreign Secretary Bevin, especially regarding the Greek plebiscite. It is expected that during the personnel changes in the Army, Navy, and Air Force departments, the current First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, will have a significant promotion in the Cabinet.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Performance over Athens</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 8th] The periodic flooding of the Nile River has not deviated from its normal course for five thousand years, but recently it has shown an abnormal state, with the water level almost level with the levees, unseen in two hundred years. Egyptian irrigation experts are baffled by the reason. Meteorologists believe that the recent two atomic bomb explosion tests on Bikini Atoll have affected the stratosphere, accelerating the condensation along the equator, which is the reason for the high water level of the Nile River.</p>
<h3>Southern Territory Demand for Italy - Ukrainian Representative Fully Supports - If the Boundary Line Proposed by France is Not Revised - The South Declares It Will Refuse to Sign Any Treaty of Peace with Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] Yugoslavia's demand to acquire Gorizia, the second largest city in the province of Venezia Giulia, is supported by Ukraine. According to the boundary line suggested by France, Gorizia will be divided into southern and Italian parts, Belarus suggested that the city be fully returned to the South. At today's peace conference, Ukrainian representative Betrovsky supported Belarus' amendment, pointing out that the boundary line suggested by France would establish an artificial corridor between the Port of Trieste and Monfalcone, depriving Slovenia of access to the sea and severing the economic ties between Slovenia and neighboring provinces. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj then spoke, declaring that if the unreasonable state caused by the boundary line suggested by France is not corrected, Yugoslavia will refuse to sign any peace treaty with Italy and will never recognize any resolution.</p>
<h3>Cyrenaica Demands Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The leader of the Senussi tribe of Cyrenaica (Italian colony in North Africa), Idris, hopes that Cyrenaica will be free and independent, be able to sign a treaty with Britain, and provide Britain with bases and assist it in various aspects. In an interview with reporters here, Idris said: We have been oppressed by the fascists, so we, like other Arab countries, hold the hope of complete independence. After we gain independence, we are willing to negotiate a treaty with Britain that will benefit both sides. Idris opposes entrusting Cyrenaica to a United Nations organization and does not welcome the intrusion of forces with interests similar to those of the Soviet Union into Cyrenaica.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Northern Iran - Martial Law Declared Along the Caspian Sea Coast</h3>

<h3>Puppet Puyi Escorted Back to Vladivostok - Says Emperor Hirohito of Japan Should Be Held Responsible for the War</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] The puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, was escorted back to Vladivostok yesterday. Before leaving, Puyi met with reporters and made a statement. When asked about his thoughts on the Japanese Emperor, Puyi replied: "The Japanese monarchy is the worst despotic political system in the world, and it is the biggest obstacle to Japan's democratization. The Japanese Emperor must take full responsibility for Japan's criminal actions, especially the responsibility for the war against China and the Pacific War. At that time, if the Japanese Emperor wanted to stop the war, he could have brought the war to a complete end. But he did not do so, and instead issued an edict approving this war. How can his crime be excused? In short, Hirohito's failure to stop the war was not accidental, but a true revelation of the real character of the Japanese monarchy."</p>

<h3>Bulgarian Plebiscite Trend - Overthrowing the Monarchy and Establishing a Republic - The Royal Family Prepares to Go to Egypt for Exile</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bulgarian Capital, 8th] Bulgaria held a plebiscite today to decide whether to retain the monarchy or choose a republic. So far, there is no voice throughout Bulgaria supporting King Simeon II to keep the throne. The Orthodox Church has declared its support for a republic. The Bulgarian capital has been decorated with lights and flags in advance to commemorate the plebiscite. Cartoons are found everywhere in the streets, depicting the king as a Nazi accomplice and a reactionary. Judging from the phenomenon, the monarchy will inevitably be rejected. It is heard that the royal family is planning to leave Bulgaria for Egypt for exile early next week.</p>

<h3>Crossing the English Channel to Paris (Part Two) - The City of Art, Rich with the Aroma of Coffee</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Xueyan</p>
<p>At the Calais train station, no one came to check passports. The train soon departed, which initially surprised the reporter. Why can one enter the country without checking passports? Knowing this earlier, why did I have to apply for a visa in advance? Wasn't that unnecessary? Later, I learned that the check is done on passengers during the train ride. It turns out that the special train from Calais to Paris picks up passengers directly from the ferry and goes directly to Paris, without stopping in between. Therefore, no passengers can get off the train mid-journey. The train ride takes nearly four hours, which is enough time for the check, so there is no need to crowd the process in Calais. This shows the ingenuity of the French in handling things. Within France, the train is French-style. The carriages are spacious, similar to British trains. However, where a British train would place two seats, a French train places three, which makes it seem more crowded. Yet, the carriage walls have many decorations, which are absent on British trains, showing that an artistic nature is revealed everywhere. From</p>
<p>Calais to Paris, the train takes about four hours. The entire route is full of fields and lush forests, truly worthy of being called fertile land. From time to time, one can see farmers working among them. It is now the autumn harvest season, and horse-drawn carts full of golden harvests slowly drag towards nearby rural homes. The scenery here is a bit like the regions south of the Yangtze River in China, unlike England. The English countryside has rolling hills, and it is rare to see boundless plains. The population is dense, and the houses are closely packed. Even if there is a vast plain, it is mostly turned into a park, planted with flowers and grass, serving as a place for people to play and rest. England has a particularly large number of grasslands, everywhere. Every holiday, the grasslands are filled with tourists resting, having picnics, and spending their holidays. I often feel that the whole of England is one big garden, except for the houses, which are places for people to enjoy. Natural farmland also exists, but it does not occupy an important position in England. According to statistics from the British Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: the total number of people in the UK whose main occupation is farming is about 700,000, accounting for slightly more than one percent of the total population. No wonder</p>
<p>there are fewer English fields. Moreover, most of English agriculture is livestock, orchards, or vegetable cultivation, and there is very little cultivation of rice and wheat. Most of those engaged in agriculture also use machines to replace labor. When you occasionally see someone working in the fields, there is always a small engine running back and forth on the ridges. There is little actual manual labor, so it is always a strange feeling. Now, seeing the French countryside suddenly makes me think of the situation at home, which feels like returning home. In the French farmland, I also saw many girls and children assisting in the work, which is also similar to China, but absent in England. The train arrived in Paris in the evening. After putting down the luggage in the hotel, after taking a short break, I was taken by a friend to walk on the road to see the night view of Paris, so that the old country bumpkin who just entered the city could broaden his horizons. Although Paris also has narrow streets, the main roads are wide and straight, seemingly endless, and the atmosphere is indeed much larger than London. As for the ingenuity and beauty of the shops, houses, and window decorations along the roadside, London is far behind. It is precisely because the roads are wide and the sidewalks are particularly wide,</p>
<p>Parisian cafes place four or five rows of tables and chairs in front of the store, under the shade of plane trees, allowing customers to sit and drink coffee and watch the pedestrians. It is said that there are more and more guests in the afternoon, and it is even more crowded at night, which is also not available in England. English restaurants and cafes close at dusk, so no matter how lively the street is, it is quiet and sparsely populated by seven or eight o'clock in the evening. Many countrymen who have the habit of eating supper before going to bed are confused when they first arrive in England and go to the streets at night to look for food shops, but they are always disappointed and complain endlessly. The night market in French cafes is no less than the snack shops in China. This is the characteristic of the French who are born to be artists. Whenever the lights and the moon shine together, and the guests are full, the male and female guests laugh and flirt with each other, only knowing how to pursue the joy of life, allowing passers-by to watch, without any scruples. According to those who have been to France before the war:</p>
<p>Although the prosperity of Paris has gradually recovered, compared with before the war, it is now far from what it used to be. I don't know if Parisian youths also had such a reputation during the German occupation? And if unfortunately, they had not won the war, where would these youths go to seek pleasure? Or where would they go to endure the bitterness of life? French perfume is already famous, so there is no need for reporters to say more, but what is strange is that even on the wide roads, you can always smell the fragrance of powder. As for the endless fragrance indoors, it goes without saying. It seems that the entire air covering Paris is permeated with the smell of perfume and rouge. This is a unique taste that people who come to Paris for the first time especially experience. No wonder some frugal artists who came here since the First World War are reluctant to return home and would rather spend the rest of their lives in this country, and it is said that they still rely on the Ministry of Education's scholarship to survive.</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu - Talks Freely About the Focus of Future Governance - Supporting Private Enterprises, Promoting Thrift and Increased Production - Establishing Industrial and Commercial Supervisory Offices in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu met with reporters at his private residence yesterday and gave a brief explanation of the focus of the ministry's future work. He stated: I do not like to talk about plans in grand terms, and I have always advocated being realistic. China should be industrialized and should move towards a planned free economy, which is beyond question. Now let us start with the work of this ministry. This ministry was established during the war, and initially the various departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and the Resources Commission were all within the scope of the ministry's jurisdiction. Since agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy were separated, the scope has gradually narrowed, but there is still a large affiliated organization, including the Resources Commission. During the War of Resistance, the Resources Commission played an important role in state-owned enterprises and made great contributions. All projects were directly instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Recently, the Resources Commission has also been separated. Under such a scope, the focus of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is limited to the economic administrative part, but I strongly agree with this.</p>
<p>Doing Big Things in a Small Area</p>
<p>Because I like to "do big things from small beginnings" rather than "do small things from big beginnings." At the same time, we look at the Soviet Union, where the agricultural and industrial sectors are divided into almost twenty departments, such as the Department of Chemical Industry, the Department of Mechanical Industry, etc., all doing big things in small areas, which can be used as an explanation. In the future, this ministry will be responsible for improving state-owned enterprises and promoting the development of private enterprises in economic administrative work. In short, the important work of this ministry in the future will be to support, supervise, and oversee, and we will spare no effort to fulfill our mission. In order to concretely handle the above-mentioned three major tasks, this ministry is currently planning to establish industrial and commercial supervisory offices in various important industrial and commercial areas across the country to represent the Ministry of Economic Affairs in assisting private industrial and commercial enterprises, promoting restoration work, and organizing industrial loans to increase production efficiency, purely serving the private industrial and commercial sectors. This organization does not conflict with the original industrial and commercial administrative businesses of the construction halls and social bureaus of various provinces and cities. Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Shenyang have been selected as the first seven places to be established, and they will be universally established next month. When this office is established, the original special commissioner offices dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to various places should be closed.</p>
<p>Broaden Your Perspective and Endure Hardship for a While</p>
<p>Regarding how to balance international income, Mr. Wang said: At present, the phenomenon of trade deficit is inevitable in the early stage of national industrial recovery, but there are also two different situations, which cannot be generalized. For example, in some countries, people can save money and reduce their consumption levels to exchange for industrial raw materials, machinery, and increase production, then the trade deficit is normal. In some countries, people not only cannot save money, but indulge in extravagance and extreme enjoyment, then the trade deficit is naturally very dangerous. Our country is in the middle of these two situations. We are close to the red and close to the black. It is really a time for us to be vigilant. Two months ago, when I was meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce, I said that the issue of frugality is very important. Sure enough, the Shanghai Municipal Government has also established a Thrift Movement Committee. Now everyone says that Shanghai's electricity is not enough, but may I ask if the neon lights in the stores that are on all night can be saved and used for factory electricity instead? To draw inferences from one instance, that is to say, everyone must be hardworking, and if everyone is hardworking, foreign luxury goods will not be able to be imported at all. I hope that people all over the country will broaden their horizons, endure hardship for a while, and promote the future achievements of national industrialization. Therefore, when it comes to saving the crisis of trade deficit, first, the people must be frugal; second, the cost of domestic goods must be reduced; third, the quality of domestic goods must be improved. The same applies to import and export trade. Everyone must be vigilant all the time. In a word, "The first Japan has been defeated, and the second Japan may come again." Mr. Wang went on to explain that balancing trade income and expenditure cannot be achieved solely by raising foreign exchange and exempting export taxes. It still depends on the government and the people working together, practicing frugality, and increasing production, which is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>The Mission of the China Textile Corporation During the State-Run Period</p>
<p>Regarding the business situation of the China Textile Corporation, Mr. Wang said: The monthly business income of the China Textile Corporation is now turned over to the national treasury, and the amount is quite large, which is helpful for balancing the income and expenditure of the national treasury. The corporation itself is working hard to restore production. The factories in Tianjin and Qingdao have been taken over and restored. It seems that it cannot be generalized that "state-run enterprises are not as well-run as private enterprises." Even so, the China Textile Corporation will still abide by the government's promise to completely transfer to private ownership within two years or at most three years. The mission of the China Textile Corporation during the state-run period is twofold: (1) to fully resume work, (2) to get the resumption of work on track. After the mission is completed, it will be handed over to private ownership immediately. As for the future method of transfer to private ownership, there are three options: (1) individual bidding for each factory, (2) individual organization of companies for each factory to sell stocks, (3) selling the stocks of the entire corporation. Which method to adopt has not yet been decided. At this point, the reporter raised two more questions, which Mr. Wang answered as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) There is a shortage of cotton in the Northeast recently, and people are worried about clothing. Does the ministry have a plan for the restoration of production of the textile industry in various regions?</p>
<p>(Answer) The ministry will make full use of the existing equipment of resources in the Northeast to assist in the relocation and development of private enterprises. Those related to people's livelihood industries often aim at achieving self-sufficiency, and the textile industry is one of them. To achieve self-sufficiency, of course, it is necessary to expand production, and there is no distinction between inside and outside the pass, and there is no regional restriction on the scope of material supply. The China Textile Corporation has begun to take over the textile factories in various parts of the Northeast, and it is possible to plan for the resumption of work.</p>
<p>Question: What is the reason for the recent surge in the price of rayon? What is the government's inventory? Is there a way to stabilize prices?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The reason for the surge in the price of rayon is actually formed by unscrupulous merchants engaging in price gouging and monopoly. (2) The government is unwilling to explain the inventory situation, but recently the government has ordered a large number of finished products from Japan through barter trade. The first batch will arrive in Shanghai this Sunday. The batch of orders is enough for one year. There is no shortage in the market.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Opens This Morning - Second Meeting in the Afternoon - Mayor Wu Attends and Reports - Supplementary Election of Councilors Can Be Produced Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The first meeting of the first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be held starting at 9:00 this morning. The first meeting in the morning will discuss the rules of procedure, the agenda, the organization of the review committee, and the election of councilors. At the second meeting in the afternoon, the mayor will report. Regarding the issue of alternate councilors attending and speaking, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet received an internal reply, and it has now decided to issue each alternate councilor an attendance permit and has sent out all the notices yesterday. The alternate councilors do not need to collect them again. The number of proposals received by the council has reached more than 350 as of yesterday, and they are currently being classified and printed in time for distribution at the third meeting tomorrow. A total of 166 councilors have reported. Fei Shusheng, Wu Shaoshu, Zeng Jun, Rong Hongsan, and Wan Molin are on leave for personal reasons. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Ma Shaojun, and others have not yet arrived. The meeting place was not arranged until 11:00 last night. It is very simple and solemn.</p>
<h3>Review Committee - Divided into Ten Groups</h3>
<p>[Another News] In order to summarize the various proposals and facilitate discussion and review, the conference specially organized ten review committees (the task of the committee is to review various proposals and policy reports). Each group is attended by familiar personnel. The draft of each unit has been drafted and will be submitted to the conference for amendment when discussing this case at the first meeting. The tasks of the ten review committees are listed as follows: The first group reviews proposals and policy reports on civil affairs and autonomy, the second group reviews police affairs, the third group reviews finance and land administration, the fourth group reviews finance, industry, and economy, the fifth group reviews public utilities and public works, the sixth group reviews education and culture, the seventh group reviews social welfare and labor relief, the eighth group reviews health, the ninth group reviews the city budget (the conveners of other review committees must also participate), and the tenth group reviews legal system and proposals not belonging to other groups (the conveners of other review committees must also participate).</p>
<h3>The High Popularity of Councillor Candidate Jiang Jianbai</h3>
<p>It is also reported that in this election of councillors to participate in the National Government, Jin Zhenyu, Qin Liankui, and Jiang Jianbai are the three candidates. It is understood that Dr. Jiang Jianbai, the representative to the National Assembly, has the highest popularity among them. Based on general observations, it is likely that Mr. Jiang will be elected. It is noted that Mr. Jiang has a Ph.D. in Education from Columbia University in the United States. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927, he participated in revolutionary work. Subsequently, he served as Section Chief of the Education Bureau, Section Chief of the Education Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Professor in the University Department of China Public University in this city. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, he was ordered by the Ministry of Education to lead education in Shanghai and fight against the enemy and puppets for four years. Later, he was transferred to serve as a commissioner in Burma. After the fall of Burma, he was transferred to serve as a commissioner in India. In 1943, he was appointed as a representative in the United States by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education. It is said that he was summoned back to China this spring to attend the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Our Consul General in Xiangshan, Mei Jingzhou, Returns Home</h3>
<p>Mei Jingzhou (see photo), the Consul General stationed in Xiangshan, has been in office for fifteen years since taking office in 1931. Mr. Mei is capable and insightful, and his handling of various overseas Chinese affairs has been praised by the overseas Chinese. Consul General Mei is meticulous in his diplomacy and planning and has responded appropriately. Since the September 18th Incident, he has often delivered English speeches to resist Japan and has written articles to refute the enemy's fallacies, which are widely circulated among Chinese and Western people. After the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, Consul General Mei worked even harder for the War of Resistance, often giving speeches on various radio stations, attacking the Japanese aggressors' policies. On the one hand, he sold national salvation bonds to overseas Chinese and encouraged donations to help wounded soldiers and refugees. On the other hand, he promoted Chiang's strategy of leading the entire nation in the War of Resistance. It is reported that Mr. Mei has returned to China to report on his work and will stay for several weeks. Once his mission is completed, he will return to continue serving the country.</p>
<h3>High Prevalence of Venereal Diseases in Shanghai: One in Ten</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Electric Dispatch] The Shanghai representative of the Executive Yuan stated in a review meeting of the Executive Yuan today that it is estimated that 300,000 people in Shanghai suffer from venereal diseases, accounting for 12% of the total population.</p>
<h3>Inspection Team Scheduled to Go to Hangzhou Today; Two More High-Profile Cases Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>The entire Inspection Team is scheduled to go to Hangzhou by train today. Last night, a State Council meeting was held at the Supervisory Envoy's Office to discuss the handling of unfinished cases and the investigation work and steps to be taken after arriving in Hangzhou. It was also decided that all pending cases in this city would be handled by the Secretariat according to the established guidelines. New cases will not be accepted for the time being. It is reported that the team received two final confidential reports yesterday: one accusing the receiving personnel of failing to include more than 500 taels of gold transferred from a certain large enemy-owned yarn factory during the takeover in the inventory. The other accuses a certain bureau of embezzling the informant's bonus that should have been received for reporting enemy and puppet concealment of property.</p>
<h3>Philippine Airlines Opens New Shanghai-US Route</h3>
<p>Philippine Airlines has opened a new route from Shanghai to Manila, Honolulu, and California, USA. The schedule is two flights per week, on Mondays and Fridays. The journey from Shanghai to the United States takes three days. The fare from Shanghai to California is US$965.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Talks About the Northeast at a Tea Party of the China-South Trade Association: The Northeast is Rich, the People Suffer</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, a representative of the Northeast Relief Association, flew from Nanjing to Beiping with Bishop Yu Bin on August 6th, and then went to the Northeast to comfort the refugees. After completing his mission, he returned to Shanghai with them on the evening of the 3rd of this month. The China-South Trade Association of this city held a tea party at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, where Mr. Wang Xiaolai spoke about the current situation in the Northeast and invited the press to attend. Mr. Wang gave a detailed account of what he saw and heard in the Northeast, entitled "Talking About the Northeast." According to him, the current situation in the Northeast has been detailed in Bishop Yu Bin's speech. He only briefly spoke about the wealth of the Northeast and the suffering of the people of the Northeast. At the same time, Mr. Wang plans to invite people from the business community to form a Northeast inspection team to go north to understand the situation in the Northeast. He hopes to gather everyone's wisdom and efforts to develop the Northeast. This proposal will soon be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for discussion in the hope of realizing it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang first described the organization of the Northeast Relief Association, which is chaired by Madame Chiang and co-chaired by Mo Dehui. The total relief fund is only 230 million yuan. With the assistance of the government, the same amount of Northeast circulating notes were exchanged, which is actually equivalent to more than 3 billion yuan, greatly benefiting the refugees in the Northeast. At this point, Mr. Wang described in detail the circumstances of attending several mass rallies after arriving in the Northeast. The people of the Northeast were very excited and grateful for the association's relief efforts. In addition, he visited industrial plants in Qingyang, Anshan, Fushun, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and other places. After the visit, he deeply felt that every plant and tree in the Northeast is very great. The Japanese built a lot in the Northeast during the 14 years of its occupation. According to Mr. Wang, the Japanese in the Northeast were actually different from those in the Southeast. In addition to working hard on construction, they did not cause any damage. The production of the Northeast supported the eight-year war. However, these industrial zones are only superficial at present, and most of the internal machinery has been moved away by a certain party, and then destroyed and burned by the communist army, causing this wealthy Northeast to suffer such trauma, which may not be restored in a short period of time. Mr. Wang also made a heartbreaking statement, "Others did the looting, and we did the burning," which shows the general situation in the Northeast today. The great rivers and mountains have become rubble. Mr. Wang then talked about the suffering of the people in the Northeast. The climate in the Northeast is severely cold. This winter, the people in the Northeast will face serious problems with clothing, housing, and medicine. If preparations are not made in advance, then the compatriots in the Northeast this winter, even if they do not die of starvation, will die of cold. Thinking about it with closed eyes is really unbearable. It is hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Grieving Righteous Man Did Not Get to See Peace; All Circles Mourned Shao Xubai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The memorial service for martyr Xubai (see photo) was held at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than a thousand people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyin, Lu Jingshi, Feng Youzhen, Xie Dahuang, Xi Yushu, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xuexiang, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xianqing, and representatives from various public organizations. The layout of the venue was solemn and respectful. The plaque "Eternal Righteous Spirit" written by Chairman Chiang was hung high at the entrance, and wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by various parties were hung all around. The memorial service began at 10:30 a.m. Mayor Wu could not attend in person due to other important business. Wu Wangwei Shao Shu, Youzhen, Yang Youren, Shui Xiangyun, and Xie Dahuang from the City Party Headquarters acted as attendants. After the ceremony was performed according to etiquette, Lu Jingshi reported on the deeds of Martyr Shao, saying, "It is with deep sorrow that we are attending the memorial service for Martyr Shao today. Because Comrade Shao participated in Party affairs, the students did their best, and even more actively during the War of Resistance. Martyr Shao worked hard for the labor movement. The Seafarers' Anlv Association was led by him, and it is still a labor movement unit. When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward, in view of the importance of publicity, he ran the Dagong News Agency, which was later closed down. He then set up the Daguang News Agency to send out news that was beneficial to the War of Resistance. The enemy and puppets repeatedly threatened and tempted him, but he remained unmoved. Finally, on the evening when he finished his work and returned to his residence on Fuxu Road, he was ambushed by thugs waiting at the entrance of the alley and sacrificed himself for the country. We are holding this memorial service to hope that we will not fail the martyr's legacy." Subsequently, Chen Baohua, Xie Dahuang, Shui Xiangyun, Feng Youzhen, Wang Xianqing, and others delivered speeches in turn, and Shao Xiehua, a member of the martyr's family, delivered a thank-you speech, expressing gratitude and deep gratitude on behalf of the family. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned at around 11:00 a.m. After the meeting, various groups held public memorial ceremonies separately. The participants included (1) the press, (2) the General Labor Union, (3) the Daguang News Agency, (4) the Seafarers' Anlv Association, etc. It did not end until 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Crickets Are Fat Before and After the White Dew; The Market Around Wuma Road Is Lively; More Than 10,000 Are Sold Every Day</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] When God created the world, he had already established the necessary existence of "competition." In nature, the law of the jungle is a common occurrence. There are indeed many who are fond of cruelty and killing, and crickets are just a representative of this!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was White Dew, the golden age of crickets. Anyone with a little experience in playing with crickets knows that the crickets in the half-month period of seven days before White Dew and seven days after White Dew are the most vigorous and the best at fighting. These few days, on the streets and alleys, and along the relatively quiet roadsides, groups of children are squatting, teasing crickets, driving them to fight to satisfy their "desire for victory" and vent the aggressive nature of human beings. This is not just a child's game. In this metropolis, I don't know how many idle classes and playboys are raising them frantically, using them as a tool for gambling.</p>
<p>The small shops that specialize in selling insects, fish, flowers, and birds around Wuma Road, Liuma Road, and near Xizang Road are the suppliers of crickets in this city. They have established institutions for purchasing crickets in Pudong, Longhua, Caohejing, and Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jiangbei, and other places, and have specially contracted merchants who transport them in large quantities from the production areas every day. Ordinary crickets are each packed in a small bamboo tube, and the particularly strong ones are treated in a brick pot. They are called "fallen pot goods." It is said that the highest price is tens of thousands of yuan per cricket. Ordinary "fallen pot goods" cost about 20,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan. Because there is no fixed standard price, the price of crickets also varies depending on whether the subject is new or old. They often supply the young masters of the mansions, not according to the number and price, but rather according to the "rewards."</p>
<p>There are four shortcomings when playing with crickets, called: "Dry, old, thin, glutinous." Dry means that the production area of the cricket must be dry, which can be distinguished from the color. Old means whether the age of the cricket is too young or too old, which can be distinguished from the "foot flowers" on the legs and feet. Thin means that the body should be thin, and those that are too fat are not good at fighting. Glutinous means whether the turning is flexible and whether the response to the enemy is smart. This cannot be distinguished without old experience. According to the color, there are also categories such as heavy cyan, purple cyan, and white cyan. Yellow head and red teeth are definitely good goods. White teeth are suitable for a duel in late autumn. The most important point is: the head should be big and the body should be thin. It is always a top-grade thing. If you want to talk about the production area, you have to recommend "Hang insects" – those produced in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Zhuji are the best. It is said that small shops around Wuma Road sell more than 10,000 crickets every day. Usually, the crickets that children play with cost 100 yuan for two, 200 yuan for three, and the higher ones cost 500 yuan or 800 yuan each.</p>
<h3>American Films Pour In in Large Numbers; The Drama Circle Is Approaching Its Demise</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] The drama circle in Shanghai, from splendor to plainness, this phenomenon is terrible and serious! People who stay in Shanghai should remember that when drama was at its peak, it had ten theaters: Lyceum, Carlton, Lafayette, Lihua, Jincheng, Jindu, Xinguang, Paris Jiuxing, and Meihua. However, currently, it has been reduced to only two: Lyceum and Guanghua. Drama is in a precarious state, and people who love the arts are worried about it: the end of drama has come.</p>
<p>Although the drama circle has reached its lowest ebb, its glorious battle history in the past is still indelible. During the long nights of the occupation, the works performed by drama, in addition to a few relatively boring comedies, mostly performed relatively gentle and gloomy realist dramas. And the drama circle itself never responded to enemy and puppet plays. There was only "Jiangzhou Weeping Blood," hosted by "Huaying" and cooperating with the "Anti-British and American Association," and "Turning Back Is Shore," cooperating with the puppet police bureau's prevention section.</p>
<p>·Hard Work: Actors Seek to Leave·</p>
<p>After the victory, due to the large influx of American films, fashionable gentlemen and ladies were attracted, and drama was gradually overwhelmed. In a short period of time, the number of theaters was reduced to four: Carlton, Lafayette, Guanghua, and Xinhua ("Lyceum is an irregular theater.") Although the scope of the theaters has shrunk, business is still sluggish. The Shanghai Drama Art Society, which was hosted by playwrights from Chongqing, had very dismal box office sales at the beginning of its performance at "Guanghua." If it weren't for the success of "Promotion Chart," this historical troupe would have collapsed long ago. In addition, "Hard Work," which was performed for a long time at Lafayette, was under economic pressure on the one hand, and on the other hand, because it had not established a rehearsal system over the years, the result of individual development of the actors caused a gap between the actors and the director - the actors despised the director and ignored the comprehensiveness of the drama, thinking that they could cope with the performance with a few good lines. As a result, "Hard Work," which was centered on director Zuo Lin, had internal cracks, and actors sought to leave one after another, and "Hard Work" disintegrated.</p>
<p>However, birds of a feather flock together, and two kinds of people with different understandings of drama were divided into two camps. One is the actors who take profit as the premise and the star system as the means. They take raising the treatment of actors as the slogan and organize their own drama troupe. They have performed "Thunderstorm" and are currently performing "Wen Tianxiang." "China Electric," led by Zhang Junxiang, was unable to overcome the low-level taste of the Shanghai audience for a while due to their serious performance attitude, so their performances of "Teacher for All Generations" and "Return of the Earth" also encountered great economic setbacks. So this true army merged with Zuo Lin in a serious work attitude and recently organized the Audience Drama Company. After the autumn coolness, they will perform Yang Cunbin's "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" at Lafayette.</p>
<p>·Seeing Through the Worldly Dust: Shangyi Ends·</p>
<p>"Shangyi," which rose up during the Pacific War, was an overflow of the bad drama. Fei Mu led a group of people, disbanded "Huaxin Film Company," and hid the already filmed "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" and "Hong Xuanjiao," which determined their attitude of non-cooperation with the enemy and puppets. They refused to participate in the performance of "Home," which was commemorating the puppet government's return to the capital, by dissolving "Shangyi." They had fought against "Zongyi," which was jointly run by Mei Xi and Mei Qian and the Japanese ronin's "Reporting Department." Although they were secretly flowing in the stratum, they were always keeping warm, clean, and constantly flowing. However, after the arrival of victory, they also encountered economic setbacks. Last month, they received a general notice from the front desk - Carlton: The house will be repaired and the film will be changed, and they will move out by the end of the month. So this troupe with four years of glorious battle history announced its end after performing the commemorative play "The Worldly Dust."</p>
<p>·A Dream of Red Mansions: Backstage Loss·</p>
<p>"Lihua," this small theater, has always been in a precarious state. Because the theater is small, there are few viewers for small plays, and even if large plays are sold out, they will lose money. The performance of "A Dream of Red Mansions" last month was an example. Business was very good, but the backstage still lost money. Now, this "Xinmei," which has no organization and not many actors, has also ended. Although it is said that "Leifeng Pagoda" will be performed in the later stages of "Lihua," there is also a possibility that Shaoxing opera will be performed instead.</p>
<p>"Lyceum" is the property of the British, and he is unwilling to rent it to any drama troupe for a long time, because they have their own musical troupe for irregular performances. They also want to rent it to musical groups and "opera" and "ballet" performances organized by the White Russians. What is currently being performed is the all-star system "Wen Tianxiang." Recent news has come that this ideal theater may be changed to show movies. Then the future of drama will be even more bleak.</p>
<p>·Shangshi Actors Scattered·</p>
<p>Performing "Promotion Chart" for three consecutive months has given "Shangju" in Guanghua a better foundation. "Peacock Gall," which is currently being performed, had already begun rehearsals two months ago. Although the subject and performance are extremely strict, the box office sales are still not good, so this is really a serious problem. There are only two drama theaters in Shanghai, and neither of them can maintain business. The "China Performing Arts Society" spent more than 20 million yuan in capital, and the first shot, "Wen Tianxiang," was still not successful. It is heard that business is still not good. And neither of these two theaters has strong capital and cannot afford to lose money. Also, the Shanghai Experimental Drama Troupe once performed "A New Official Takes Office" and "Spring Cold" at "Lyceum," losing more than 18 million yuan. Recently, actors from "Shangshi," such as Tao Yu, Shu Qiao Wen, etc., who were originally actors from "Zhongwan," have arranged "Qing Dynasty Official History" and are going to Nanjing. Whether to participate in "Shangshi" again is also a problem.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a Drama Association in the Shanghai drama circle, which has held several meetings. Its only task is to organize a "Special Committee" to review and report on film and drama traitors, but so far there have been no results. There is a Drama Welfare Association that has provided some money to poor and sick artists. There is an Actors Friendship Association that held a meeting and wanted to perform a few small plays without success. There is a drama school, which was not very strong at first, but now that some experts have come to Shanghai, his teaching has become stronger.</p>
<p>At present, the Shanghai drama circle is in a low ebb. What is terrible is that the troupes are ending one after another. What is sad is that most drama workers are too lazy to even touch their scripts.</p>
<h3>Celebration of Victory: A Quick Sketch of the Grand Parade</h3>
<p>At the request of 80 store units of this newspaper's Xungu Great Factory, the grand parade celebrating the victory of 99 and promoting domestic goods was held yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., arousing the public's desire to do their best to advocate it. The participating parade vehicles included 16 vehicles from Hongda Rubber Factory, Zhongmei Cigarette Factory, Zhongxing Bank, Yunshang Company, Fumin Pharmaceutical Factory, Yongxiang Printing House, Hongxing Weaving Factory, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, Shenghua Pharmaceutical Factory, Yang's Chemical Therapy Research Institute, Qiankun Trading Company... led by the command vehicle of this newspaper.

Along the way, it stopped for ten minutes at Jing'an Temple, Caojiadu, Xintajie, the Great World, the entrance to Huaji Road Park, the Sixteenth Pier, Laoximen, Tilanqiao, the North Railway Station, and other places. Various manufacturers distributed promotional materials. At this time, nearby residents came to watch, shoulder to shoulder, extremely crowded, and the lively scene was evident. This trip lasted six hours. All the bustling urban areas of Shanghai were passed through. It was not until 4:15 that the team returned to the hall and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Commemorating "September 8th Triumph": A Grand Gathering at the Jingu Building</h3>

The initiators and more than 100 guests attended, including Shanghai Miss Wang Yunhai, Xie Jiahua, Peking Opera Queen Yan Huizhu, and others. Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiguang also gladly attended.</p>
<p>A notice was posted beside the staircase of the Jingu Building, stating that this fellow party had no distinction between guests and hosts. All participants were grandchildren, meaning that each person had to pay 20,000 yuan to have food. At the same time, raffle tickets were used, which is a fashionable trend recently. Among the prizes were theater tickets for Queen Tianchan and the Grand Stage. Ge Futian repeatedly reported in the microphone that if you win a theater ticket for Queen Tianchan, you can listen to Tan Fuying's Empty City Stratagem on the 9th. One ticket is for two seats and is in the front three rows. Those with a craving for opera were very excited. During the meal, initiator Wang Xiaolai briefly described the origin of the party. Soon after, Peking Opera a cappella began. After three songs were sung, dancing began. Wang Xiaolai and Mrs. Chen Tingrui, and Chen Tingrui and Miss Wang Yunmei led the dance, but the dance floor was rather deserted. Ge Futian reported again on the microphone, saying that today is a general meeting, and even though Director Xuan is present, everyone can dance as much as they like without being restrained.

Other programs included Peking Opera by Yan Huizhu, Bai Yuwei, Xie Jiahua, and others, as well as martial arts performances and comedy. They dispersed happily at 12:00.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Sports Day; Shanghai Sports Day Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>On September 9th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the National Government issued a decree to revise the National Sports Law, and designated that day as Sports Day. Therefore, the establishment of Sports Day was undoubtedly to promote the National Sports Law. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The revised National Sports Law was promulgated at a time when the War of Resistance was at a critical stage. In view of the fact that only two or three out of ten draftees called up for military service passed the physical examination, and the unprecedented seriousness of the source of soldiers, the establishment of Sports Day was aimed at promoting the universal attention of the people to sports, improving the national health level, so that they could be efficient producers in peacetime and brave warriors defending the country in wartime, without wasting ammunition. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Every year on this day, provinces and cities across the country have various sports activities to embellish this festival. In terms of form, promoting sports has been done as much as possible. However, in reality, the effect is minimal. Why? It is because of one day of exposure and ten days of coldness. It is because there is no funding and it is just an embellishment. It is because the venues are insufficient and the equipment is simple. Therefore, to commemorate Sports Day, first, sports must be listed as an indispensable part of daily life. Second, the government must include national sports funding in the national budget in accordance with the National Sports Law. Third, a large number of sports venues must be built and their equipment must be enriched. This is because weapons must have venues to be used, and if a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. This is the third point.</p>
<p>"September 9th" is also the day when Nanjing accepted the surrender last year. Therefore, commemorating this festival in the future has a double meaning. A Western saying goes: "The chest of youth is national defense." We should reflect on this. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>What is sports? Its latest definition is "education from physical activities." It forms an equilateral triangle with moral education and intellectual education, and cannot be separated. If the three educations are separated, so that the entire equilateral triangle becomes three independent sides, then morality, physical education, and intellectual education will all damage their own lives and weaken their functions. This is the fifth point.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Branch Conducts General Track and Field Test; Wang Xuewu Breaks National Record in Javelin</h3>
<p>The Sixth Branch of the [year] regiment held its final general test of track and field training at the Hongkou Zhongzheng Park track and field this afternoon at 4 PM. As a result, Wang Xuewu broke the national record in the javelin with 55.20 meters. Fang Lian's shot put performance was also good, breaking the city's sports meet record for the season with 12.10 meters. Lou Wenao's 3,000 meters also broke the national record with 10 minutes and 3.7 seconds. The results of each event are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) 100 meters: Tan Qing, 11.4 seconds; (2) 200 meters: Tan Qing, 22.8 seconds; (3) 400 meters: Tan Qing, 54.2 seconds; (4) 800 meters: Lin [obscure], 2 minutes and 11.2 seconds; (5) 1,500 meters: Lin Canran, 4 minutes and 40 seconds; (6) 3,000 meters: Lou Wenao, 10 minutes and 3.7 seconds (breaks national record); (7) High Jump: Jin Kun, 1.65 meters; (8) Discus: Fang Lian, 25.50 meters; (9) Javelin: Wang Xuewu, 55.20 meters (breaks national record); (10) Shot Put: Fang Lian, 12.10 meters.</p>
<h3>The Capital Air Force Basketball Team; Suffers a One-Point Defeat to Ren Yu; The Result is 43 to 42; First Half is 20 to 18</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Although it is not basketball season, with basketball teams from all over the country coming to Shanghai, the city's basketball scene is poised to unfold on a grand scale. Last night at 8 PM, at the stadium, the Nanjing Air Force basketball team played its first game against the city's strong team, Ren Yu. The result was 20 to 18 in the first half, and the overall result was 43 to 42. The expeditionary force suffered a tragic defeat by one point.</p>
<p>Air Force Strength</p>
<p>Looking at the strength of the Air Force, individual skills can be said to be on the standard line. The shortcomings are the lack of teamwork and the use of offensive and defensive methods that are already outdated tactics. They use a five-person zone defense and rely solely on long shots with no guarantee of success. However, success or failure cannot be used to judge heroes. The visiting team's spirit of fighting is indeed commendable. Perhaps there was an abnormal performance under the great scene for the first time, but we will see later. A brief description of last night's battle is given below:</p>
<p>Competition Process</p>
<p>The two teams took the stage on time. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Jin Jiabiao. The visiting team was eager to win, and committed many fouls at the beginning of the game. Ren Yu relied on free throws to get four points first and take the lead. Then Liu Zhenyuan scored, but Ren Yu became rampant again, and the central breakthrough method worked again, taking a remote lead with eight to two. Afterwards, the Air Force joined forces to counterattack, relying on long shots to score, gradually catching up. In the first half, Ren Yu still won by one goal with 20 to 18. After the change of sides, after 24 to 23, Wang Helin of the visiting team made a shot, which was the first time they had exceeded. Since then, the visiting team has taken the lead by four or five points for five minutes. However, the team was unable to defend, and Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu was lively and active, sneaking in and succeeding without fail. Therefore, the overall result was 43 to 42, defeating the visiting team.</p>

<h3>Sports Day and National Sports - Shao Rugan</h3>
<p>The victory of the Anti-Japanese War has reached its first anniversary. Today we celebrate the sports festival, and the central government and provinces and cities hold various sports activities to commemorate it, which has a profound meaning and is worthy of praise. On this sports day, we are moving from deep pain to the road of national construction and rejuvenation. The tragic longing has been replaced by the joy of victory, and the commemorative festival for the surrender has arrived, making us feel even more excited and joyful. There are many ways to build a country, but the construction of national sports is the foundation for strengthening the nation. The prosperity of a nation is based on the accumulation of national physical strength. When the national physical strength is strong, the nation will also become strong. Conversely, it will be a weak nation. What is the physical strength of our Chinese nation? The backwardness of national sports and the crisis of national physique are causing great hidden worries. According to expert surveys and statistics, the average life expectancy of Americans is 60 years old, while the average life expectancy of Chinese people is 30 years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, based on the experience of new recruits and the results of physical examinations of young people in various military academies and schools, it was proved that too few passed. The Air Force accounted for 4%, and conscription accounted for 25%. Most of them could not meet the conditions for military service, and the weakness of the general national physical strength was enough to affect the entire national strength. As one of the five great powers after the war, there should be a strong country, a strong people, and a strong race.</p>
<p>It has been more than 30 years since our country promoted sports. Perhaps because of the vast land and population, it is not easy to popularize it to the whole people. Or because of talent and economic relations, the organization and environment have failed to adapt to the needs of the times. Or because of the trends of popular customs, it has failed to cater to modern sports thought. Although all parties have enthusiastically promoted it and comrades have worked hard to implement it, the internal factors and external influences have not shown significant progress. Sports practitioners should of course be responsible, but the lack of self-improvement spirit among the people is also a major reason.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to awaken the people across the country to pay attention to sports training and expand the propaganda of national sports, the Ministry of Education issued the "Key Points for Holding Sports Day (September 9th)" in the Ministry Order No. 221156 on June 9th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). The educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities should be responsible for organizing national sports activities on Sports Day, and invite schools, organs, and groups in the area to form a committee to handle them. A week before Sports Day was designated as Propaganda Week. Publications and newspapers were used for written propaganda, and important activity methods were promoted to the people by members and students of organs and schools. The sports activity items were determined according to local people and conditions, such as Chinese martial arts, race walking, mountain climbing, swimming, horseback riding, rowing, racing, weightlifting, ball games, track and field, etc., which could be adopted as appropriate. In addition to publicizing the significance and methods of sports, various sports activities were carried out in accordance with the local environment.</p>
<p>In addition to the key points for methods announced by the Ministry of Education on the Sports Day of the Victory Anniversary, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Affairs sent telegrams, and there were also instructions for coordinating the work of the National Health Movement Center: (1) Holding citizen health exercises, (2) Citizen sports conferences, (3) National health lectures, (4) Conducting a major inspection of the cleanliness of public places and streets, (5) Screening hygiene education films, (6) Expanding the publicity week of the National Health Movement.</p>
<p>Today is Sports Day, and major cities across the country are holding sports events. On this commemorative festival, it is a large-scale national construction movement after the victory. We should draw lessons from the past and consider how to build national sports in the new China. Commemorating Sports Day is a powerful movement and also the beginning of national sports. Regardless of gender, age, or occupation, everyone should understand clearly that sports training is a right, and training in sports is an obligation. Everyone should enjoy rights and everyone should fulfill obligations. Then there is hope for the universal development of national sports. Or it is said that Sports Day is the world of sports practitioners or those who are enthusiastic about sports activities. This misconception should be corrected.</p>
<p>As the festival approaches, we feel doubly excited. We must continue to promote with the spirit of commemorating the festival. Then the commemorative day of this Sports Day will have meaning. We must step up the construction of national sports in order to live up to the true meaning of commemorating Sports Day.</p>
<p>The various activities of Sports Day are the motivation to promote national sports. The important principles are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sports activities should be popularized: It is hoped that every citizen will have the opportunity to participate in sports.</p>
<p>(2) Sports activities should be organized: Regardless of vertical or horizontal organization, all schools, groups, and people from all walks of life should rise up to establish a rational sports organization.</p>
<p>(3) Sports activities should be nationalized: Attention should be paid to modern national defense military training, and basic aviation knowledge and skills training must be earnestly promoted.</p>
<p>(4) Sports activities should be academic: Modern sports thoughts should be adapted, sound cadres and talents should be trained, and sports academics should be improved.</p>
<p>(5) Sports activities should be economical: At present, financial and material resources are difficult, and the greatest effort should be made with less economic resources.</p>
<p>Governing is not in much talk, and working is only in hard work. At the time of the commemoration of Sports Day, the author deeply expresses his fervent wishes. Shanghai is the cradle of national sports, and it should take the lead in initiating. Comrades in the national sports world, let us rise up and work together to complete the mission we should bear.</p>

<h3>Using Yang Xiu's Name: Changfeng Team Sells Tickets in Hangzhou, China Youth Disagrees and Refunds Tickets</h3>
<p>The China Youth Swimming Group of the Municipal Youth Association, at the invitation of the Hangzhou Changfeng Swimming Association, went to perform for the second time and agreed to bear the travel and accommodation expenses. The two parties agreed in advance not to sell tickets. However, after the China Youth arrived in Hangzhou, they learned that Changfeng was using Yang Xiuqiong's name to promote the event extensively and sold 4,000 tickets worth 2,000 yuan. The China Youth immediately expressed their disagreement. After discussion, in order to maintain their reputation, they decided to refund the tickets. The China Youth performed as usual. After the performance, the person in charge of Changfeng left without a trace, and all food and accommodation expenses were paid by the China Youth themselves. On the afternoon of the 8th, the China Youth's original plan to cross the river was also cancelled due to this incident. To save money, the China Youth took the midday express train back to Shanghai yesterday. Before leaving, Liang Zhaoan and others from the China Youth bid farewell to Yu Meisi, the general manager of Changfeng, and Qiu Yiyuan, the director of the Yuquan Swimming Pool, but they avoided meeting. They left a letter asking them to fulfill their promises and entrusted the Hangzhou Youth Association to handle the negotiations. The entire group then returned to Shanghai. Therefore, the group will participate in the swimming competition held at the Hongkou Swimming Pool today.</p>

Mr. Jiang briefly stated: (1) Human rights are civil rights, which are the foundation of all democracy; (2) Education trains and establishes civil rights; (3) Senators should take striving for civil rights and training civil rights as the basic spirit for promoting education in the field of education; (4) The comprehensive development of education and the independence of educational funding, or increasing the current proportion, should be the goal to strive for; (5) Use educational organizations to exert educational power and complete the mission of education; (6) The current municipal senators should formulate policies and steps for the development of education in this city. Mr. Jiang held important positions before the war and was elected as a representative of the educational sector to the National Assembly. During the war, he successively served as the Education Department's commissioner in Shanghai, India, and Burma. Finally, he was sent to the United States for investigation and entered Columbia University to specialize in education, obtaining a doctorate in education. He was invited to participate today, showing his concern for education, which is admirable.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Qiutan Scholarship Funds: 2 Million Yuan Allocated for Book Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] The Nanjing Qiutan Scholarship Fund was established before the war and was relocated to Hankou during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory and restoration, it returned to Nanjing and has already completed its first session. The second session is now being held after the summer vacation. The board of directors of the scholarship fund held a meeting in Beijing recently, with more than ten directors including Wu Zhongwen, Li Qingsong, Zheng Yanghe, Wang Chengzhang, and Chen Jingyu attending. It was decided that 2 million yuan would be allocated for this session as scholarship funds for university and middle school students. The number of university students is set at 50, limited to students with Nanjing registered residence in Nanjing and Shanghai, with each student receiving 12,000 yuan for book expenses. The number of middle school students, including senior and junior high school students, is 120 to 150, with each student receiving 6,000 to 8,000 yuan for book expenses, limited to students with Nanjing registered residence in Nanjing municipal and private well-known middle schools (such as Zhongying Middle School). The eligibility standards are based on students from poor families with excellent grades. The association's funds include real estate in Nanjing and Hankou, which is used to generate income and pay expenses. The current office is located at No. 252 Taiping Road, Nanjing.</p>
<h3>National Goods Market: Commission for Scholarships, Only 50 Million Earned Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Goods Market, sponsored by the Wooden Education Loan Committee, was announced to be closed on the 5th of this month. On the morning of the 8th, the domestic goods manufacturers participating in the First Market held a meeting. The results of the settlement showed that the total amount earned by each factory's self-sale in the market was 227,120,000 yuan, 2,539,240 yuan was earned from consignment sales, and 12,156,270 yuan was earned from charity sales by various schools, totaling 251,815,510 yuan. All proceeds from charity sales are attributed to the loan association. Self-selling and consigning factories will extract 20% or 30% respectively and donate to the loan scholarship fund, which can raise more than 50 million yuan. In addition, the total turnover of the Second Market, which was hosted by Aurora University, was more than 12.7 million yuan in five days of operation, with a surplus of about 5 million yuan after deducting costs and expenses.</p>
<h3>China Medical College: Normal Enrollment and Classes</h3>
<p>It is said that the China Medical College, founded by the famous Chinese medicine doctor Zhu Hegao, will not be banned by the Ministry of Education. It is now known that this is not the case. It is reported that the two Chinese medicine colleges in Shanghai and New China have been banned by the Ministry of Education. As for the China Medical College, it has not received any order from the Ministry, so the college is still continuing to enroll students and start classes as usual.</p>
<h3>Principal Dai of the Conservatory of Music Expresses: Will Expand Music Education</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The reporter visited Dai Cuilun, Principal of the National Conservatory of Music, yesterday. According to him, the school is preparing to resume classes under difficult conditions. The original Jiangwan campus of the school is being repaired. The school term will definitely use the original site as the campus, and the school will provide transportation for professors. As for the campus at No. 626 Aivenyi Road in this city, it will be allocated as faculty and staff dormitory. Since the school is a national institution, the tuition fees are limited, and the treatment of professors is relatively low, so it is quite difficult to hire professors, but the school is still trying its best to remedy the situation and hire famous Chinese and foreign musicians as professors. According to Dai, the school plans to establish a junior class and a symphony orchestra soon to expand the promotion of music education. The school currently owns more than 20 pianos, and there are still several grand pianos that have been ordered from abroad and will be shipped for use soon. When the reporter asked about the issue of jazz music, Dai replied: Even if it is jazz music, it must be played properly. The music in Shanghai dance halls today is played by performers with poor skills and the content is extremely mixed, which is the cause of the current phenomenon. In short, it is still necessary to comprehensively improve the general level of music, then there will be no room for the existence of overly low-level music.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Seven-Association Office Bans Pirated Textbooks: Elementary School Students Go to School But Don't Attend Classes</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper in Hankou] Although all public and private elementary schools in Wuhan held opening ceremonies on September 1, the date of formal classes is still nowhere in sight (7th). Elementary school students go to school but cannot "attend classes," which is very distressing. According to the heads of various schools, there are various difficult reasons for not being able to start classes immediately: (1) Many school sites have been borrowed by the army and cannot be vacated for a while. (2) The number of schools is too small, and there are too many out-of-school children. Every school is overcrowded, and the number of students introduced and requested from various parties exceeds more than twice the enrollment capacity. (3) The negotiation between the pirated textbook bookstores and the Seven-Association Supply Office to ban piracy has not yet been resolved, and they cannot be supplied on schedule. Even if one or two schools can start classes early, there is no book to read because the official national textbooks must be transported from Shanghai to Hankou. (4) It is also difficult to hire qualified and experienced teachers.</p>

<h3>Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Industries Held a Symposium Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Commercial Association held a symposium at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Cigarette factory representatives were also invited to participate to strengthen communication. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council, Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Zhuyi, representative of the Municipal Government, Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Department, Lu Keming, Municipal Councilor, and Chen Su of the Social Affairs Bureau were all invited to attend and give instructions. Weng Yanyou, the current chairman of the association, delivered a short opening speech, stating that the symposium aimed to establish close contact between the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories, so as to balance the production and sales of domestic cigarettes, maintain legitimate profits, and reverse the cigarette industry crisis. Xu Wenxiang, the standing supervisor of the association, then delivered a speech, saying that the association now has 4,324 member units, and dozens of them cannot safely pass the Mid-Autumn Festival due to market conditions. The reasons are: (1) heavy tax burdens and unstable finances, (2) foreign goods are flooding and dumping in the city, and (3) lack of communication between the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories. We must remove the above three evil causes before the cigarette industry can get on the right track. Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, saying that the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories are responsible for production and sales, respectively, and their interests are shared and closely related. No third party can participate, nor can any third party win them over. We hope that the two industries will cooperate and assist each other, understand each other, establish close contact, and jointly plan the balance of production and sales, and strive for the domestic cigarette industry. Representatives from various groups and organizations then delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Dai Gengxin, chairman of the Cigarette Factory Industry Association, delivered a thank-you speech. The meeting adjourned at 5:20 PM.</p>

<h3>De Fu Bu Neimen Distributes Goods: 14 Million Yuan for Shilin</h3>
<p>Defu Foreign Firm has stopped allocating goods to various factories for nearly a month. It is reported that there is news of Shilin allocation recently, with the price being about 14 million yuan per 60 kilograms. The allocation price in the previous period was close to 10 million yuan, an increase of 40%, while the black market price exceeds 20 million yuan. As a result, the dyeing price of Indanthrene dyes has been adjusted by various dyeing factories to between 34,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan due to the sharp rise in raw materials. Bu Neimen Caustic Soda has been allocated to dyeing factories since last month at 160,000 per barrel. Before the exchange rate adjustment, there was an intention to allocate it to manufacturers at 260,000, but the company stopped allocating it due to exchange rate fluctuations. There is now talk of re-dispatching, with prices often above 400,000 yuan. It is reported that the order price in the United States has also increased to US$0.16 per pound, plus insurance and freight, it can be seen that the cost has increased. If Bu Neimen does not continue to allocate, the price may rise.</p>

<h3>Hardware Flows to Small Countries, Domestic Goods Rise Instead</h3>
<p>In the hardware market, amid the influx of foreign goods, people's hearts have begun to weaken. Pipes, threaded rod, belt buckles, screws, abrasive cloth, etc., have all declined by about 10% last week.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is preparing to welcome and host them.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of a Sound Securities Market</h3>
<p>— Yang Yinpu</p>
<p>My country's capital is weak and its industry is backward. To this day, the company structure has not been universally adopted; basic enterprises have not seen large-scale development. On the one hand, raising funds and issuing shares is deeply difficult; on the other hand, scattered funds flood the market. Although the causes of this contradictory phenomenon are not one-sided, the lack of a sound securities market, which leads to the stagnation and dysfunction of long-term funds, is undoubtedly one of its main reasons. In view of this, the Executive Yuan issued an instruction in May to actively organize the Shanghai securities market. At that time, Du Yuesheng was designated as the chairman of the preparatory committee, Wang Zhixin as the vice chairman, and Xu Jilong, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Huancheng and other seven people as members. After the establishment of the preparatory committee, it actively carried out preparatory work. For example, drafting company articles of association and various rules and regulations, reviewing the qualifications of brokers, reviewing listed securities, repairing the market, and arranging personnel have all been completed. After three months, it officially opened today. The foundation of the capital market can be said to be a grand event that can be recorded in the financial history of our country.</p>
<p>(1) Characteristics of the Newly Established Institution</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Stock Exchange", which was completed this time, inherited the foundation of the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange" before the war, and can be traced back to the "Shanghai Stock Commercial Association" and the securities industry's "tea party" in the early years of the Republic of China. On the one hand, it accepts the old system, and on the other hand, it creates a sound new system. There are three points that can be mentioned for its characteristics: First, complete the unified organization; second, establish an expanded foundation; third, determine the nature of the market.</p>
<p>A. Completing the Unified Organization. The existence of a securities market in Shanghai did not begin today; however, the existence of a unified and centralized securities market in Shanghai can be said to have begun with the "Shanghai Stock Exchange" established today. During the era when the securities section of the "Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange" existed, there were three securities markets coexisting in Shanghai; after the securities section of the "Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange" was merged, under the situation where the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange" and the Western "Shanghai Zhongye Gongsuo" stood side by side, the securities markets coexisting in Shanghai were still more than two. The newly established institution this time, on the one hand, inherits the system of the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange," and on the other hand, incorporates the business of the Western "Shanghai Zhongye Gongsuo," creating an unprecedented unified situation with Shanghai's only market. This is its first characteristic.</p>
<p>B. Establishing an Expanded Foundation. Before the war, the original securities market, on the Chinese side, centered on the domestic association; on the Western side, it centered on foreign business associations. The foundations were biased, and the business became fragmented. The newly established institution this time, in terms of the organization of the exchange itself, in addition to the old shareholders, added the investment of the state's five banks, which is one aspect of the foundation's expansion. Furthermore, in terms of the scope of approved brokers, in addition to including the old domestic "association" peers and Western "Zhongye" members, it also includes legal entity brokers from silver, money, and trust companies, as well as other individual brokers who have engaged in or managed securities investment business and meet the prescribed qualifications. This is another aspect of the foundation's expansion. Encompassing multiple aspects and blending into one, the foundation is expanded, and strength increases accordingly. This is its second characteristic.</p>
<p>C. Determining the Nature of the Market. The securities traded in the Chinese market before the war were all government bonds, and their function was limited to the adjustment of fiscal surpluses and deficits. Strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as a "financial market." The securities listed in the Western market before the war were all foreign stocks, and their function was limited to the vitality of foreign capital. Strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as a "foreign capital market." One focused on finance, and the other focused on foreign business. There was no connection with the capital required by large-scale enterprises, and neither could truly be called a long-term capital market or a capital market. The business scope of the newly established market this time takes the stocks and bonds issued by domestic enterprises as its center, while also including government-issued public bonds and securities issued by foreign businesses in China. While encompassing and including everything, it differentiates between importance and weight. The nature of the capital market is ultimately determined. This is its third characteristic.</p>
<p>(2) The Functions That a Securities Market Should Have</p>
<p>If industry is to develop rationally, adequate and usable funds are undoubtedly one of its most important conditions. "Adequate and usable" means that the time when these funds can be used must match the actual time needed for the industry to turn over. The funds required for industrial equipment are generally longer-term and larger in amount. Because of the large amount, it is necessary to find ways to open up multiple avenues for absorption; because of the long term, it is necessary to find ways to enhance the liquidity of funds. It seems that there is no better way than to "securitize" them.</p>
<p>The slogan of "securitizing long-term funds" was advocated by enlightened people in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. And the most important key to "securitizing long-term funds" lies in the establishment of a sound securities market. The most important functions of the securities market in this regard can be listed in three aspects: First, enhance the liquidity of funds; second, expand the base of fund sources; third, indicate effective avenues for investment.</p>
<p>A. Enhancing the Liquidity of Funds. Funds in the form of securities become instruments that can be circulated; securities with a market for buying and selling gain a path for circulation. Long-term investments are feared to be stagnant, and worried that they cannot be sold when they want to be realized. In other words, they are most likely to lack liquidity. Now, if they are given the form of securities and a market for buying and selling is established, they can be sold at any time, that is, the funds invested can be recovered at any time. From then on, although the form is a long-term investment, it actually contains a short-term effect, and its activity can be greatly enhanced. At the same time, securities with this high degree of activity will surely become a good collateral target in the financial community. Therefore, although this investment is long-term, it can be realized immediately by selling it; it can be used for loans immediately. There is no fear of stagnation, and no fear that it cannot be sold. This is because of the existence of a securities market, which enhances the liquidity of funds. This is its first function.

<h3>Pulp Rises by 10%</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 7th] The Price Administration Bureau announced that the price of domestic and imported wood pulp will increase by approximately 10%, which is estimated to increase the annual cost of paper mills using wood pulp by 25 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Managers Circle: Artificial Silk Rises by 500,000, Silk Goods Rise with Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The price of rayon on Monday and Tuesday of last week was 2,256,000 yuan, which was quite stable. Starting from the next day, actual sales were active, and it rose by more than 100,000 yuan. On Thursday, Zhongfang Company stopped allocating, which greatly stimulated people's hearts, and taking advantage of the opportunity that No. 120 glossy was out of stock, the black market frantically raised prices. The price soared by more than 200,000 yuan on that day, and it rose by another 150,000 yuan on the weekend. In total, it rose by a huge amount of 500,000 yuan in a week. Miscellaneous glossy and semi-glossy also followed suit, rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. No. 150 glossy was even more expensive than No. 120, rising by more than 600,000 yuan. Transactions between factory managers and foreign firms were limited, and the money supply was very tight, so the price could not rise. The domestic market hovered up and down last week, with only a difference of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price on the weekend was similar to that on Monday. Sales of silk goods gradually improved, and due to the high cost of raw materials, the prices of all goods increased uniformly, increasing by about 10% in seven weeks. However, compared with raw materials, it is still inadequate. According to various manufacturers, if the raw materials cannot be lowered, the cost of silk goods is crucial and must be increased.</p>

<p>Production Construction</p>
<h3>A Year of Victory</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>A year has passed in the blink of an eye since the victory. In this year, when one wants to talk about production and construction, it is truly something that evokes many feelings. Due to various reasons, most production endeavors are struggling amidst difficulties, with very little success.</p>
<p>In reality, during the war of resistance, due to the lack of resources and the devaluation of currency, factories were merely increasing figures on paper every day, without being able to attend to, or even needing to attend to, work efficiency and other matters. Therefore, it can be said that no preparations were made for the efforts needed by the post-war construction class.</p>
<p>After the victory, many situations did not live up to expectations, resulting in numerous difficulties and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Unlike the industries of countries like England and the United States, which were spurred to increase production during the war and were able to quickly return to normal production after peace,</p>
<p>A year of precious time has passed, but we must not let the lack of achievement diminish our spirit of progress. Many years lie ahead, waiting for us to strive forward.</p>
<p>To put it more practically, let us quickly formulate a plan for the coming year.</p>
<h3>Impressions of British and American Industries</h3>
<p>— Translated by Deng Shaoqiu from "Far Eastern Economist" No. 12</p>
<p>(1) Travel Impressions</p>
<p>I remember a long time ago (1930 and 1933) I visited England twice, and last year (1944) I also visited the United States. Although these three trips were very short, they left me with many impressions. This year, I was fortunate enough to visit England again and also made two very satisfying and pleasant trips to the United States, gaining many new insights worth reporting to the readers. Here are some insights regarding the industries of England and the United States, which can also serve as a reference for many worldwide industrial improvements.</p>
<p>(2) British Industry</p>
<p>My trip to England took place during the five months shortly after the end of the war against Germany and before the victory over Japan. At that time, British industry was in the process of transitioning from wartime to peacetime production. Therefore, the many cotton yarn weaving factories in England had been converted to produce munitions and weapons, as were other bicycle and automobile factories. Of course, returning to the original state not only requires money but also more time and manpower. However, British industry recovered faster than people expected.</p>
<p>Working conditions in British factories have greatly improved, also due to the needs of the war. The factory workplaces are well-arranged, clean, and bright, and the seats are quite comfortable. Furthermore, wireless radios are installed in the workplaces, allowing workers to listen to harmonious music while they work. Therefore, the work efficiency of British workers is very high. For example, in cotton yarn production, a female worker can manage six machines with two hundred and twenty to three hundred yarn spindles, whereas in India, they only manage two. Therefore, one difference between British industry and that of other countries is its high work efficiency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the war has been very beneficial to British industry. Many factories have installed the most advanced new machinery and equipment due to the urgent needs of the war. At the same time, government funding, internal expansion, and the establishment of many new factories in the past five years have naturally led to high efficiency in these factories, thereby promoting the development of British peacetime industry. However, some factories expanded their scale in a hurry for urgent needs, and the equipment is incomplete. Some factories also lack capital, making it impossible to compete with highly efficient factories, and they face the risk of closure over time.</p>
<p>(3) American Industry</p>
<p>If we only consider work efficiency, American industry is even better than British industry. Although British work efficiency is already much higher than that of other countries, American factories have even more complete equipment, and workers generally use and cherish their machines. Furthermore, American workers do not demand increased wages due to the factory's mass production, nor do they worry that increased production will lead to unemployment.</p>
<p>Americans are excellent at organization. They have plans for everything. For example, factory managers strive to help workers. However, the British believe that American workers lack creativity, and the work efficiency of American senior workers is not higher than that of the British. However, it must be understood that 99% of American workers have a spirit of enterprise, which is an undeniable contribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all working conditions in America are better than those in England, and wages are also higher. American workers receive two dollars in wages, while British workers only receive one dollar. Moreover, American workers can often receive material rations. This is because the unit production cost in the United States is lower than that in England, and it adopts large-scale production, while England adopts division of labor production. Therefore, the standard of living for American workers is higher than that for British workers, and higher than the standard of living for workers in all countries in the world.</p>
<p>Between 1939 and 1944, the United States government spent 40 billion US dollars on equipping industries, adding equipment, and changing plans. They are confident that they can compete with any country and are preparing to increase exports by 50%. Fortunately, the American government and industrialists have also seen the necessity of industrial construction.</p>
<p>(4) Research in the Industries of the Two Countries</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of industrial research in England and the United States, it has naturally achieved great success. The I.C.I. factory in England employs 1,500 chemists to conduct experimental analysis and research. American factories are also willing to spend millions of US dollars on research work, and after the war, the number of researchers and research funding are increasing linearly.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone knows that post-war global economic competition will be more intense than during and before the war. If a country does not want to occupy a leading position internationally, then industrially backward countries must quickly rise and strive forward, or they will be dominated by others. Improving work efficiency and strengthening industrial research are the most organized and planned industrial construction.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yang Shuxun Talks About the Future of China's Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Research is more important than sales; the future is quite bright</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Shuxun, the head of the Yang's Chemotherapeutic Institute, obtained a PhD in chemistry from the University of Chicago in the United States. After graduation, he was hired as a researcher by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, specializing in research work. Peking Union Medical College had already requested that he return to China to serve, and he was eventually hired as a researcher by the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>He has always focused on research work because he believes that a pharmaceutical business cannot be without research facilities. Even the success or failure of a factory can be determined by the condition of its research laboratory. Without a research laboratory, it is like having no master.</p>
<p>He believes that after this victory, many imported medicines can be researched, manufactured, and replaced. When he first manufactured "New Xihua Powder," he conducted market research. At that time, Bayer's Salvarsan had an annual turnover of one million yuan in China, and French 914 had an annual turnover of three to four hundred thousand yuan. Japanese medicines also had two to three hundred thousand yuan. Later, when "New Xihua Powder" was released, it did have a significant impact on them.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yang Chuanshi then invented "Insulin" and other effective drugs, and even the recent "Xiaofaping Pain Reliever" can replace imported products.</p>
<p>Previously, when Dr. Yang was employed at the Academia Sinica, he drafted a plan for government-people cooperation, which was to establish a pharmaceutical department within the Academia Sinica, specializing in research work. The research results and the manufacturing plan for a certain drug would be handed over to private pharmaceutical factories, and the Academia Sinica would extract a prescribed commission from the turnover. In this way, the Academia Sinica could have an income to maintain research work, and private pharmaceutical factories could also obtain new pharmaceutical plans at any time. Unfortunately, it only lasted for half a year before it was virtually suspended due to the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Yang's vision, the future of China's pharmaceutical industry is quite bright, as long as it focuses on research work.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Jiale Paper Mill</h3>
<p>— Song Cheng</p>
<p>In our country where all production undertakings are backward, the paper industry is no exception. Therefore, before the War of Resistance, most of the paper had to be imported from abroad—especially from Sichuan. It was not until 1928 that Mr. Li Jieren returned from studying in France and established a noteworthy production organization in a little-known corner of western Sichuan, which was the birthplace of Jiale Paper—the Jiale Paper Mill. It is said that Mr. Li's establishment of the Jiale Paper Mill was initially just a trial, a gamble, because he wanted to use the more than 100,000 dan of rice straw produced annually in Leshan (also known as Jiading, located at the confluence of the Minjiang and Qingyi Rivers) to make paper. As a result, he finally succeeded in the experiment, and "Jiale Paper" began to meet the Chinese people. However, although the paper was made, the sales became a problem—either heavily discounted or ignored. At that time, Mr. Li Jieren tried to solve the sales problem by opening the "Li Bao Guan" in Chengdu, and all the paper needed daily was Jiale Paper. In this way, although Jiale Paper had a way out, it affected the sales of the newspaper—because competing with newspapers printed on newsprint was undoubtedly. But Mr. Li did not lose heart and continued to persevere according to his plan and hope.</p>
<p>After the start of the War of Resistance, traffic was blocked accordingly. Those who could use imported paper before the war also had to use Jiale Paper instead. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, Mr. Li finally established a strong throne in the rearguard of the paper industry, and the name "Jiale Paper" was well known in the rear. Before the victory, the Jiale Paper Mill's Jiale Paper was all sold or distributed to various institutions and organizations by the Economic Control Bureau, so sales spread to major cities in the rear, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Xi'an, where it had offices.</p>
<p>Jiale Paper Mill is located outside Jialemen, Leshan, western Sichuan. The author recently visited the factory with a pleasant mood. According to Mr. Cao Jianjun, the business director of the factory, the total area of the factory is 39 mu. When the author visited, the "squeak, squeak, squeak..." of the machines broke the surrounding silence. They now have three paper machines, one of which was allocated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs last year, and one was purchased when the factory was opened. It is now old and its efficiency has been greatly reduced, so it is not often used. The other was added in 1941 and is the most heavily used machine. The raw material for making Jiale Paper is rice straw, which the factory needs 450,000 to 500,000 jin per month. When making paper, the rice straw and other materials are first put into a cooking sphere, and then chemicals such as caustic soda are added, and steam is added to steam it to 80 pounds. When the raw materials in the cooking sphere are cooked, they are taken out and put into a pulping machine, and beaten until the fiber is extremely fine, and then enter the pulp storage pool to add "filler". The pulp flows from the pulp storage pool through the adjuster into the settling basin, settling out the fine sand and debris in the pulp, and then enters the paper machine, first passing through a round net made of copper wire cloth inside the paper machine, which carries it out and applies it to the felt roller of the paper machine, and then the felt belt enters the press to absorb the most water and make the pulp tightly rolled and ironed, and then the felt belt is brought to the drying cylinder. The drying cylinder is a smooth roller made of a round steel plate, and high-temperature hot steam is passed in. The pulp is completely dried by the high heat of the drying cylinder. Jiale Paper rotates on another rolling shaft. It is reported that the entire process from rice straw to Jiale Paper only takes eight hours. If cotton, rags and hemp textiles are used instead of rice straw, white Daolin paper can be made. Because the factory has problems with the cost and sales of Daolin paper, it still manufactures Jiale Paper to supply to users in the mainland. However, it was recently heard that the factory will cooperate with Yongli Chemical Industry Co. to prepare to build a larger paper mill near Dongchuan. Hopefully this is a fact, and the paper industry in Sichuan will undoubtedly become more developed and sound.</p>
<p>The current director of the Jiale Paper Mill in Leshan is Mr. Chen Xiaolan, and there are more than 400 employees. Most of the workers have a deep relationship with the factory, so labor and management are quite harmonious. A three-shift rotation system is adopted, with eight hours per shift. The factory has employee consumer cooperatives, barber shops, medical offices and other facilities, specializing in serving the workers who sweat for the production cause.</p>
<h3>An Outline of Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>D. Supervision of Work</p>
<p>In the progress of manufacturing work, constant supervision is required. This supervision work can be divided into two types:</p>
<p>A. Supervision during the work progress,</p>
<p>B. Inspection of the product manufacturing process,</p>
<p>The first type of work is easy to understand. For example, if we build a house, we must hire a supervisor to monitor the progress of the work. His responsibility is to prevent the workers from being lazy and the construction company from cutting corners.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, there can be two methods:</p>
<p>The first method is to use our eyes to do the monitoring work. The foreman in the manufacturing plant is the person responsible for this type of work. He must see whether the workers are lazy during working hours, or whether the work meets the standards. If he discovers something, he should immediately correct it so that it does not continue to go wrong. The second method is to use the recording method. For example, for attendance, each worker has a card, and when going to work, he punches the clock to record the time, and the same is true when leaving work. Also, there are records of the work produced every day. This method not only allows the director of a department to see the workers' achievements, but through statistical work, the authorities of a company can also see the progress of the factory. For example, if we run a farm with tens of thousands of cattle, then each cow has a number, and there can be a statistic of how much milk it produces every day. The owner of a milk company can know everything about the cattle without entering the cattle farm—their production, their health, their consumption.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not possible for a company director to go around inspecting all day long, so the method of recording and statistics is the most able to supply his needs.</p>
<p>Usually, the above two types of work are carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of goods, then the impact on the future of the goods is very large, and it must be handled seriously. I have visited the General Electric Edison Bulb Factory. Every step of their manufacturing process has to be inspected. Before being packaged and shipped, several pieces have to be sampled and inspected to see if they meet the standards. Another example is pharmaceutical factories. Medicines also have to undergo many inspections before being shipped. In order to be cautious and clarify responsibilities, many pharmaceutical factories require all the people responsible for the inspection to sign and stamp a slip of paper attached to the medicine box, especially when manufacturing drugs for injection.</p>
<p>In terms of editing and publishing books, proofreading is also a kind of inspection work—checking for errors. The Commercial Press and other bookstores once attached the names of the proofreaders to the copyright page for a time. This action also meant being cautious.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Commemorating the 99th Anniversary of the Victory: Respectfully Console Writers Nationwide</h3>
<p>Today marks the full first anniversary of the 9/9 Victory and Surrender.</p>
<p>Before this year, writers in the literary and art circles, whether in the front lines, the rear, behind enemy lines, or overseas, had contributed our energy and youth to the best of our ability, and had fulfilled our due responsibilities, with our only pen in pursuit of a single goal. We shouted, we fought, we endured, we persevered, we suffered hardships and torments, yet we finally won!</p>
<p>Although the pen is not a gun, paper bullets sometimes outweigh artillery shells. In these years, there were inevitably some sediments that rose with the flood of war and betrayed the anti-Japanese camp. However, the wheels of time have long discarded the sediments in literary and art circles. Furthermore, many loyal and brave writers unfortunately became disabled, lost their health, or even quietly passed away after fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Now that we stand before the victory monument, we can be comforted and proud. We can be worthy of our ancestors and worthy of our descendants.</p>
<p>In this past year, writers have successively returned to their original posts. However, due to the shortcomings of transportation and transportation management, some writers are still in the rear even today. Many writers have returned to the capital after a difficult journey, which is equivalent to escaping another disaster. When we recall our wartime life, who can blame writers for not producing great works?</p>
<p>Originally, the hardships after the war were expected. Now that this difficult first year has passed, the remaining limited hardships are awaiting great human power to overcome. Writers, the human spirit technicians, standing on the front lines of the literary and art cause, are of course unwilling to give up this re-emerging era's task of guiding society and encouraging the people to move towards lasting peace and a bright world!</p>
<p>Today, as we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we are even more mindful of the many friends who are struggling for food, family burdens, transportation for returning to their original posts, or housing and occupations after returning, as well as the lives of the families of the martyred friends, and we feel even more emotional! However, even with thousands of words, there is nothing to say.</p>
<p>Here, with warmth and sincerity, we respectfully extend our condolences and blessings for the victory! (Editor)</p>
<h3>Love and Death</h3>
<p>— By Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Shi Xinghuo</p>
<p>In this cemetery, officers stood as thickly as a field in full bloom. French-style kepis and red trousers, stripes and gold buttons, staff epaulettes, guards and cavalry ribbons... moving back and forth between the graves, the crosses on the graves, extending their arms of mourning towards the departed.</p>
<p>Colonel Raymond's wife had just been buried, having drowned while swimming two days prior. The funeral was over, and the priests had left. The colonel, supported by two colleagues, still stood before the grave. At the bottom of the pit, he could still see the oak coffin containing his young wife.</p>
<p>He was a tall, thin old man with short, white hair. Three years prior, he had married the daughter left behind by his deceased comrade, Colonel Sottis.</p>
<p>The commander and adjutant urged him to return, but he resisted, forcefully holding back the tears welling up in his eyes, and whispered, "No, no! Wait a little longer!" He stubbornly refused to leave, kneeling by the graveside, gazing into the bottomless abyss, in which lay buried his heart, his life, and all that he loved.</p>
<p>Suddenly, General Hamont seized Raymond's arm, almost forcibly dragging him away, saying, "Come, come! Old friend! Let's go!"</p>
<p>And so, the colonel obeyed and returned to headquarters. When he opened the door to his study and picked up a letter from the desk, he was almost startled and moved to collapse. He recognized his wife's handwriting. The postmark and date on the letter were the same. He hurriedly tore open the envelope and read:</p>
<p>"Papa! Allow me to call you Papa once more, as in days gone by; when you find this letter, I will surely be dead and already buried, therefore, perhaps you will forgive me.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to arouse your pity, nor do I wish to lessen my sin, I only wish to tell you the whole truth, with the sincere heart of a woman who is about to commit suicide within an hour.</p>
<p>"When you generously united with me, I gave myself to you out of gratitude. I loved you with all my girlish heart, I loved you just as I loved my own father—simply and completely the same; remember one day, when I was sitting on your knee and you kissed me, I involuntarily called you 'Papa,' this cry came entirely from the heart, entirely from instinct, truly, you were a father to me, and nothing else. At the time, you smiled at me and said, 'Call me that then, my child, it makes me even happier'.</p>
<p>"We arrived in the city, — forgive me, Papa— I fell into a love affair, oh! I resisted external temptation for a long time, nearly two years, but later, I succumbed, I sinned, I was to become a fallen woman.</p>
<p>"As for him, you will never guess who he is, in any case, I am easily satisfied, because a dozen officers often surrounded me, what you called the twelve satellite group.</p>
<p>"Papa, do not seek him out, nor hate him, he only did what any man would do, and I believe he loved me wholeheartedly too.</p>
<p>"One day, we had an appointment, on a small island called Bissycke, near the mill, I had to swim over, he was waiting for me in the woods, when I just caught a glimpse of him through the branches, we saw your orderly, Philippe, which startled us greatly, then, he—my lover—said to me: 'Go, hurry back, my love, leave me and this man here!'</p>
<p>I swam back so hastily that I almost drowned, when I came back, I sensed that something terrible would happen.</p>
<p>"An hour later, Philippe met me in the corridor and said in a low voice, 'I am at madam's command, if there is any letter to be taken,' then, I knew that he had been bought off by my lover.</p>
<p>"I gave him a few letters, he took them away, and brought back replies.</p>
<p>"Two months passed like this, and we trusted him as much as we trusted you.</p>
<p>"But, Papa, things finally happened: one day, on the same small island, I found your orderly, he was waiting for me, he told me that if I did not grant his request, he would report everything to you.</p>
<p>"Ah, Papa! Papa! Terror and cowardice conquered me, I thought: you have treated me so well, and I have betrayed you, I also thought of him, afraid that you would kill him, and kill me too, I was mad, I thought to buy off the hateful fellow once more—how shameful!</p>
<p>"We women are so weak, we can easily lose our minds. When a woman falls once, she will continue to fall, all the way to the bottom. I don't know why I did it, just thinking that one of you two and myself would die—so, I gave myself to that beast.</p>
<p>"You know, Papa! I will not forgive myself, what happened later is imaginable, he would use threats, again and again, to possess me, how hateful it is! How severe is this punishment, Papa?</p>
<p>"Thinking like this, everything is over, I must die, when I am alive, I cannot repent to you, dead, I have the courage to confess everything, except death, I cannot use any other method to cleanse myself, I am too disgraced, I can no longer love nor deserve to be loved, everything I touch seems to be disgraced.</p>
<p>"At this moment, I am going to take a bath, and never come back, this letter will be forwarded to you by my lover, carrying my last prayers, you will read her, when you come back from the cemetery.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Dad! I have nothing else to tell you, do whatever you want, just forgive me!"</p>
<p>The colonel wiped the sweat from his forehead, recovering the calm he had on the battlefield, he pressed the bell.</p>
<p>A servant walked in.</p>
<p>"Call Philippe!" the colonel said, opening a drawer.</p>
<p>The man immediately came in—a tall soldier, with a red mustache, a pair of cunning hawk eyes, giving an ominous gaze.</p>
<p>The colonel stared straight at his face.</p>
<p>"Tell me quickly, my wife's lover's name!"</p>
<p>"But, Colonel—"</p>
<p>The officer grabbed the pistol from the half-open drawer.</p>
<p>"Come on, quickly, I'm not joking with you!"</p>
<p>"Alright, — my Colonel— it's Commander Saint, Albert."</p>
<p>Before the name was finished, a flash of fire shone between his eyes, his forehead had been pierced by a bullet.</p>
<h3>Arthur Schnitzler</h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>Arthur Schnitzler was born on May 15, 1862, in Vienna. He was the son of a throat doctor, with Jewish ancestry. In 1885, he graduated from the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in medicine. He interned at the university hospital for two or three years. After leaving the hospital, he began practicing medicine, continuing for about ten years. During his medical practice, he often wrote novels and plays. Later, he abandoned his medical career and devoted himself to writing. He died of heart disease on October 21, 1931.</p>
<p>What first made him famous in the literary world were the three plays, Anatole, Flirtation (Liebelei), and La Ronde (Der Reigen). All three depict the lives of the upper class in Vienna. Schnitzler's works mainly draw on themes from contemporary Viennese society, especially those he found in his own environment. The protagonists are either himself or the literati around him, a group of detached melancholics. Almost all of his works are like this: a lover and one or two women. His depictions of their love affairs have an elegant charm, and his descriptions of each character have a sense of identity. Whether in drama or novel, he meticulously analyzes psychology with a scientific attitude and gentlemanly elegance, regardless of whether he is depicting an officer, doctor, musician, village girl, or widow. Schnitzler's view of life contains terror and doubt about the unfathomable nature of fate. He believes that life in this world is a frivolous game. Throughout life, one can experience intense moments of pleasure, but ultimately it is light joy and thin sorrow. Therefore, the keynote of his works is nothing more than love and death, two things. He uses melancholy, hazy emotions to depict this drama of life.</p>
<p>Although Schnitzler belongs to the Neo-Romantic school, he has gradually expanded the art of this school to realism; this is because he has a scientific mind that is close to the real world. His art is as superb as that of Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Especially in the refinement and purification of technique, he closely resembles great French writers. However, his works are universal and can be appreciated by the general public and the art world alike. This is where he differs from other Neo-Romantic writers, and it is also where his greatness lies.</p>
<p>The spirit of Schnitzler's plays is completely different from that of Sudermann and Hauptmann; although he does not have Hauptmann's strength, he possesses elegance, refinement, and gentleness. Also, his satire is reminiscent of Chekhov, who was a doctor. His best plays combine honesty and a mournful elegy-like sorrow with the seductive power of the spirit. His novels, in fact, can be described in the same way, written in a musical style with a fluent pen. He skillfully expresses these minimal facts without being repetitive or tedious. Like a master pianist, although there are only a few strings, through his plucking, he produces piano sounds of varying pitches and inflections, with endless variations. This superb artistic technique is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 27</p>
<p>"I remembered one thing, the Japanese devils' 'disappearance' was a ridiculous performance, but it was just right, how..."</p>
<p>"How did they disappear and then return to the team... and immediately spread the news?" I picked up on his question about the July 7th Incident, the disappearance and sudden return of soldiers, "From this point, you can see how hard and efficiently Tsurumi worked—of course, we had intelligence beforehand, there were two of our team members tailing that missing little devil, do you know where he was planning to go?...</p>
<p>"...Mr. W couldn't help but laugh when he saw me, and shook his head and laughed too.</p>
<p>"Not far from Fengtai, to a seedy brothel, and he even brought a big bottle of genuine wine for reward..."</p>
<p>"Bastard,... as long as they just brazenly claim that one or two soldiers are missing, who would care? Why necessarily put on a real performance?" Mr. W shook his head, while gnashing his teeth and wanting to scold, but he restrained himself from scolding.</p>
<p>"Little devils are just little devils, where else in the world can you find stupider 'pigs'?"... I said what Mr. W wanted to say. "Later, our team members caught that guy, and forced him to make three or four phone calls to several Sino-Japanese agencies—a very immoral arrangement—otherwise, even if they forced him back to the team, the little devil would deny everything, for sure!"</p>
<p>"Right?" Mr. W said bitterly, "Even so, they finally managed to burst the little devils' oriental bubble, but he still had to proceed with 'tough smoothness.'" These four words, "tough smoothness," were the terms used in Bái Kòu's secret orders, which was the intelligence we relayed to Mr. W's Beijing Station a few days ago.</p>
<p>The security within Beijing City was supposedly controlled by our guard team, although the Japanese claws; such as Korean thugs, ruffians, and down-and-out bandits, were somewhat baring their teeth, and restless, but they were only doing sneaky mischief like urban foxes and shrine rats.</p>
<p>Our car reached its destination safely—the Beijing Hotel.</p>
<p>"Old Uncle is here?" Little Tiger greeted us, and bowed deeply to Mr. W, then turned to lead the way.</p>
<p>"Auntie Ji," Little Tiger opened the door and said to the room, "Two... one is Old Uncle, one is... is..." He couldn't address him.</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, I'm very sorry..." I stepped into the room to apologize.</p>
<p>"Please sit down, gentlemen." The Northeast Miss was very generous and frank.</p>
<p>I admired Tsurumi's insight. She was indeed an outstanding talent—in my view. I remembered a philosopher who wrote these two sentences: "Your eyes reveal your spirit, your words represent your thoughts, your actions illustrate your character, your spirit expresses your aptitude, and your demeanor reveals your knowledge..." It was probably the sum total expression of these qualities that explained why she was an outstanding talent.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also understood why Tsurumi didn't want to see her, that is to say, as long as Tsurumi wasn't a hypocritical moralist. Like most sharp-eyed young men, seeing a miss like that, he would probably take winning her love as the greatest cause of his life; because she certainly had a kind of aggressive heroic spirit, but also a kind of charm that made people fall in love unknowingly, it wasn't a matter of beauty or ugliness.</p>

<h3>The Rong Case Loot</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Rong family has already sent someone to retrieve the loot recovered from the kidnappers. The actual amounts are as follows:</p>
<p>USD 94,745</p>
<p>CNY 102,715,200</p>
<p>Gold 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, 8 li</p>
<p>The USD, converted to CNY at a rate of 3350, is equivalent to CNY 317,339,575. The gold, converted to CNY at a rate of CNY 221,000 per tael, is equivalent to CNY 73,577,088. The total amount is over CNY 490 million.</p>
<p>Even so, the amount is considerable.</p>
<p>Regarding the disposition of this money, some advocate allocating it to the police welfare fund, others advocate using it to relieve the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and we have also advocated establishing the "Desheng Scholarship Fund" to support out-of-school youths; but to date, Mr. Rong Desheng himself, or the Rong family, has not made a clear and concrete statement, which is truly a matter of concern!</p>
<p>It is not that these people are greedy for money, unable to bear the sight of this money. To be honest, there are many wealthy people in Shanghai, and the Rong family is not the foremost. However, given the current circumstances, whoever puts forward a proposal is doing so for the public good and for Mr. Rong's sake.</p>
<p>Money is a good thing. It can benefit people, but it can also harm people. The question is how it is used. Those who have read the autobiography of Rockefeller (the oil tycoon) can appreciate his saying that "having too much money is a trouble." Perhaps some people even think that he hired a group of experts to organize a foundation and spend all day researching how to use money, as if he was crazy! However, we have to admit that his two sentences are truth:</p>
<p>"God gave me so much money, just to let me make good use of it."</p>
<h3>Sweet Sleep</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>On the eve of Journalists' Day, Director Zhang of the Municipal Health Bureau attended a journalists' dinner party. Mr. Zhang, in his capacity as a hygiene scholar, advised reporters to take a nap every day to refresh their spirits. This shows the importance of sleep for human health.</p>
<p>Sleep is a physiological requirement. Daily physical exertion and mental fatigue must be compensated and restored by sleep. Generally speaking, the higher the animal, the more sleep it needs per day; animals below mammals not only have less sleep time, but also have no fixed time for waking, sleeping, moving, or stillness.</p>
<p>Habitually speaking, humans need an average of eight hours of sleep per day, but according to experiments conducted successively by German scholars and professors at the University of Chicago, eight hours of sleep is a waste of time. It turns out that sleep is "quality over quantity," and eight hours of "light sleep" is not as good as six hours of "sound sleep."</p>
<p>There was an old baker in Ireland who passed away in 1936. During his lifetime, he developed a habit: he started baking bread at 8:00 PM and continued until 5:00 or 6:00 AM the next morning. When the sun came out, he would go hunting in the mountains. At one point, he averaged only seven or eight hours of sleep per week, but his body was not affected at all.</p>
<p>Apes and monkeys sleep as much as humans every day, but elephants only need three or four hours of sleep per day.</p>
<p>When sleeping, the brain's activity decreases, and the body's blood concentrates in the heart, stomach, and intestines, which can improve the function of the digestive organs, so napping is most needed in the summer. Currently, the armies and public institutions of various civilized countries are sure to implement group naps in the summer.</p>
<p>Director Zhang's suggestion to take a nap after meals is indeed worth promoting.</p>

<h3>Beard</h3>
<p>— Xu Hongfu</p>
<p>Talking about beards is enough to show the national character of a country. Although Europeans and Americans are nearly sixty years old, the lower half of their faces is always a barren land. They are forever young. Indians are not yet adults, and their curly beards are already like snails, darkening half of their faces. This fully expresses their seniority.</p>
<p>Beards are enough to make one famous and protect oneself. Dr. Mei Lanfang, who is famous far and wide, grew a mustache to show his determination to refuse to perform for the enemy and puppets, which won the approval of the whole country. "Who says artists have no backbone!" His fame became even greater. Cao Cao of the Three Kingdoms, when being pursued by Ma Chao, had to occasionally come up with the quick wit of cutting his robe and beard in desperation, otherwise he would have died under the knife long ago, wouldn't he?</p>
<p>Beards fully express the contradictions in people's hearts. Children see themselves in the mirror, and when they don't have a tuft of black hair growing under their nostrils like their fathers, they will use a brush dipped in ink to paint two strokes, in order to brag in front of their little friends. When they reach the age when beards grow, they will find it annoying again, and they will not be afraid of bleeding pain, and they will take tweezers and painstakingly pull them out from the roots, flesh and all.</p>
<p>Beards occupy a very important position in cartoons. A small mustache above the lips, we can guess, is either the comedian Charlie Chaplin or the dictator Hitler. The upward-curving figure-eight mustache of the Jintan brand is undoubtedly a senior Japanese military and political figure. As for Gorky's and Stalin's Russian-style beards, they are even easier to recognize. They are like two brooms without handles, hanging below the high nasal bridge.</p>
<p>Beards have been used as bets. Last year in Myanmar, American team members of the 14th Air Force vowed not to shave their beards until the mission was completed. This is comparable to "Exterminate the Xiongnu, then have breakfast."</p>
<p>Like other physiological characteristics, beards can give people nicknames. For example, Tian Xiushan, the Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang, is called Tian Bearded. Wang "Lài" Beard in The True Story of Ah Q is also because he has a loose beard.</p>

<h3>Professor Pei Fei's Words</h3>
<p>— Ma Chaochang</p>
<p>There are still two things that haven't changed about the Chinese</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 4th of this month, our school invited Professor Pei Fei from Columbia University in the United States to give a speech at our school for the first time. Amidst our warm applause, he appeared before us and began his speech; in his speech, he first said: "In the past, foreigners often criticized that the thoughts and actions of the Chinese people would never change, but now they see that everything about the Chinese people has changed, and they have made much more progress than before, but there are still two things that have not changed. The first thing that has not changed is that the Chinese people are always so polite to foreigners, which makes us feel too polite. The second thing that has not changed is that the Chinese people always like to listen to the advice and criticism of foreigners..."</p>
<p>When we heard this, it seemed to be just a cameo joke in his speech, but if we savor this passage of words carefully, we have endless thoughts!</p>
<h3>Low Key</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>Nanjing Road, a woman in the red dust.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road is like a woman in the red dust. Before the war, she was still a "fair-skinned and tender" good woman, but after eight years of being ravaged, she became "thin and bony" and lost all her charm. Unexpectedly, in the past year, she has become even weaker and more out of tune, and to this day, she has become "full of holes," leaving only a "skeleton."</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper and taking a look, there are cases of corruption every day. If cut out, day after day, one could compile a "Complete Compendium of Corruption." The national prosecutors seem to need one copy per person to help with case handling.</p>
<p>Some say that "there may be no one who can remember the disaster in Northern Jiangsu when seeing a big mooncake." This is inaccurate. Surely not all of the many people from Northern Jiangsu who are wandering in Shanghai have forgotten their lovely hometown?</p>
<p>The biggest purpose of cracking down on vendors is to prevent the growth of wharf thieving. Someone has suggested: hiring all vendors as anti-smuggling personnel would not only treat the symptoms but also cure the root cause. But the water police agencies are said to already have six kinds of names, so I don't know if the authorities can allow "further expansion."</p>

<h3>The Young Bishop Yu Bin</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Bishop Yu Bin, recently returned from the Northeast, is considered by many foreigners to be "China's greatest Catholic." During the War of Resistance, he worked hard to promote China and raise disaster relief funds overseas, and his contributions to the motherland are truly indelible.</p>
<p>Returning in glory to his old home in the Northeast, which is Bishop Yu's hometown, when the Chicago Overseas Chinese welcomed Mr. Yu in 1939, Archbishop Stritch of Chicago said: "I firmly believe that the puppet organization of 'Manchukuo' will soon become a historical relic, and Bishop Yu will be able to return to his 'old home' in glory." Seven years later, Bishop Yu did return to his old home in glory, but the old home was now in a state of war, with "the rivers and mountains still the same, but the scenery completely different," (as Mr. Yu told reporters.) Bishop Yu could only reach Yongji, where he used to sell books as a child, and could only stay briefly, unable to go further north to reach his birthplace in Heilongjiang. Bishop Yu's heart must be filled with emotion and sorrow!</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's courtesy name is Yesheng, baptismal name Paul, and he is from Lansi County, Heilongjiang. After graduating from the First Normal School of Jiangsu Province, he studied at Aurora University. In 1924, he went to Rome to study at the "University of the Propaganda Fide," earning three doctoral degrees in philosophy, theology, and canon law. In 1933, he also obtained a doctorate in political science from the Italian National University and taught at the Urban University for many years. In the winter of the same year, he was appointed as the general supervisor of the National Catholic Action Association of China and returned to China to take office.</p>
<p>There is still a good story in Europe: Mr. Yu once accompanied the Papal Envoy to Abyssinia in Africa for inspection and received the Five-Star Medal from the Abyssinian Emperor. Returning to Italy, he also received a medal awarded by the Italian King. Not long after, Italy and Abyssinia became enemies, and Dr. Yu held medals from both countries, adding a delightful anecdote to international diplomatic history.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1933, the Pope issued an order to delineate fifteen counties, including Jiangning and Wuxi, within the Jiangsu Diocese as the Nanjing Diocese, stipulating that it should be managed by a Chinese bishop. Because a suitable person could not be found temporarily, Bishop Huijiliang acted as an agent. It was not until 1936 that the Holy See carefully considered the matter again and decided to appoint Dr. Yu Bin. In the end, this young Catholic, only thirty-six years old, became the twenty-third Chinese bishop among the one hundred and twenty-seven dioceses.</p>
<p>In 1939, when Mr. Yu went abroad, newspapers and magazines in various countries competed to publish news and speeches about Mr. Yu. For a time, Mr. Yu became the central figure in more than four hundred newspapers and was warmly welcomed by Catholics and overseas Chinese from all walks of life. Mayor Burton of Chicago presented him with a golden key to the city, frankly expressing his welcome. Bishop Yu spared no effort in promoting China's War of Resistance and raising funds for disaster relief in various countries. As he said when he met with reporters in Guilin after returning to China:</p>
<p>"In more than a hundred famous cities, I represented the helpless Chinese civilians and appealed to the people of the world for relief, and I also told them the heroic history of China's War of Resistance, winning the assistance and sympathy of countries around the world.</p>
<p>"A Catholic, in addition to fulfilling his national duties, has two things to do: first, relief, and second, international propaganda."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu went to various countries to promote aid to China and disaster relief. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, overseas Chinese in New York held a "Hundred Ambulance Movement Rally" under Mr. Yu's leadership, with more than 10,000 people participating in the parade, raising more than 20,000 US dollars in just four hours. Mr. Yu also published "China Newsletter" in Europe, publishing documents on China's War of Resistance, editorials from major newspapers, and news of construction in the rear, which was truly the beginning of China's overseas news agency. In New York, he published "English China Monthly," with an initial print run of 30,000 copies, which sold out immediately. Canada and South American countries all subscribed.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is tall, has a loud voice, and is good at public speaking. In six weeks in the United States, he gave a total of 330 speeches. The "Montreal Renaissance News" described his speech as: "His words are solemn and accurate, without any embellishment. What is especially commendable is his spirit of universal love, even when condemning the enemy's atrocities, he has no attitude of hatred."</p>
<p>Although I am not a Catholic, I cannot help but pay my highest respect to Bishop Yu's spirit!</p>

<h3>Special Issue for the 9/9 Victory Commemoration - One Year After Victory - The Turmoil of International Politics</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>(Winning the War Was Not Easy, Making Peace Is Even Harder) More than a year has passed since the end of World War II. In this past year, international political diplomats have tried their best to create world peace. However, the peace treaties with the defeated countries have not yet been signed, leaving the post-war world still in a state of war. True peace has not yet come to the world. Today, looking back on the evolution of international politics in the year since the victory, we are filled with emotion!</p>
<p>When Germany and Japan successively surrendered and World War II ended in victory, all of humanity was overjoyed, believing that the world would enter a new era of peace and democracy and share the prosperity of a peaceful world. Unexpectedly, in the year that followed, international political turmoil arose one after another, not only disappointing everyone but also making everyone believe that "winning the war was not easy, and making peace is even more difficult." In fact, far-sighted political diplomats had foreseen this, so during the war, the Atlantic Charter was published, and the San Francisco Conference was convened. The sole purpose was to draw up a detailed and precise "blueprint" for the post-war new world order before the war ended. In particular, the Potsdam Conference held by the Big Three of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union after Germany's surrender can be regarded as the starting point for the great powers' political diplomats to strive for peace. The so-called Potsdam Declaration included two important documents: first, the declaration of unconditional surrender to Japan jointly signed by the leaders of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and second, the declaration on Germany issued by the Big Three of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The latter made many contributions to the creation of peace in Europe. The most important are two points:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers:</p>
<p>(1) Convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to continue to do all necessary work to create peace and to discuss other issues raised by the powers at any time.</p>
<p>(2) The first meeting of foreign ministers is scheduled to be held in London on September 1.</p>
<p>(3) The immediate task of the Council of Foreign Ministers is to draft treaties with the five countries of the United States, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and to propose solutions to all important issues at the end of the European war, and submit them to the United Nations for decision;</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the control of Germany:</p>
<p>(1) Implement the measures stipulated in the Crimean Declaration on Germany to eliminate German militarism and Nazi remnants, and take other necessary steps in the future to ensure that Germany no longer threatens its neighbors and world peace.</p>
<p>(2) Thoroughly disarm Germany and its defenses, and strengthen the domestic industry of Germany that can be used for military production.</p>
<p>(3) Prepare to rebuild German political life on a democratic basis and enable the Germans to cooperate peacefully in international life.</p>
<p>(4) The organization of the German economy should focus on the development of agriculture and peaceful domestic industry.</p>
<p>(5) In accordance with the decision of the Crimean Conference, Germany should be responsible for compensating the United Nations for the losses it has suffered.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the territorial issue, Germany should cede the city of Königsberg in East Prussia and its surrounding area to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(The Five-Power Conference Was Held as Scheduled) After the end of the Potsdam Conference, the declaration to Japan finally took effect because it was backed by the American atomic bomb. The Japanese Emperor broadcasted an announcement of unconditional surrender to the country on August 15, bringing World War II to a complete end. From Germany's surrender on May 9 to Japan's laying down of its arms, three months passed. Because the war in the Far East had not yet ended, the work of peace in Europe could not be carried out. After Japan surrendered and the entire war ended completely, convening an international conference to clean up the mess in post-war Europe naturally became a matter of urgency. Therefore, the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened the meeting in London on September 10.</p>
<p>From September 11 to 20, the theme discussed by the five foreign ministers was the Italian issue, which included the following issues: The Italian border issue. Not only did France have territorial demands on Italy, but Yugoslavia also had territorial demands on Italy. The disposal of the Italian navy. How to allocate the remaining warships besides those that Italy should retain. The disposal of Italian colonies. Britain and the United States both had coveted ambitions for the colonies of Italian East Africa. The Italian reparations issue. The Soviet Union demanded that Italy pay 100 million US dollars in compensation, and Greece and Yugoslavia also demanded that Italy pay reparations. After ten days of discussion, only two issues were resolved. (1) The border between Italy and Yugoslavia on the Istrian Peninsula is based on ethnic boundaries. (2) The Port of Trieste is internationalized. The rest of the issues could not be resolved.</p>
<p>From September 20 to 25, the foreign ministers' meeting discussed the Balkan issue. The rift between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union became more obvious. First, Britain and the United States did not recognize the governments of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Austria as democratic polities, so they insisted that they could not conclude treaties with these four countries until their politics were democratized. At the same time, they demanded that navigation on the Danube be internationalized, which the Soviet Union could not agree to under any circumstances. In the eyes of the Soviet Union, the Balkan Peninsula was the territory of the Slavic peoples, and they would never allow Britain and the United States to interfere. Therefore, Soviet Foreign Minister Filatov made a shocking proposal on September 22, arguing that countries that had not signed the armistice agreement should not participate in the drafting of the treaty. This proposal not only did not allow China to participate in the discussion of the European treaty, but also opposed France's involvement in the treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly opposed and engaged in a verbal battle with Filatov, but it was useless and could not change the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, the five foreign ministers' meeting was deadlocked.</p>
<p>By October 2, although the five foreign ministers still wanted to save the fate of the foreign ministers' meeting, they were ultimately unable to break the deadlock in the European issue, so the five foreign ministers broke up unhappily.</p>
<p>International Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense</p>
<p>After the five foreign ministers' meeting in London broke up unhappily, the international situation fell into a predicament. In addition, the secret issue of the atomic bomb made the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union increasingly worse. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, they both stated that the secret of the atomic bomb could be made public or handed over to international control; but there was one condition, that the Soviet Union should declare its political and territorial ambitions. In the Soviet Union's view, this attitude and approach of Britain and the United States was tantamount to threatening the Soviet Union with the atomic bomb; therefore, the misunderstanding between the two sides deepened, and some American newspapers even advocated bombing Moscow with the atomic bomb. Therefore, the international situation was tense, making nervous people think that World War III was about to break out. At the same time, in the Middle East, the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Iranian issue became increasingly acute and was also full of gunpowder. In the Near East, because the Soviet Union refused to budge on the issue of the Turkish Straits, it repeatedly demanded joint defense of the straits with Turkey; the Balkan Peninsula had become the territory of the Slavic peoples, leaving only Greece, and the situation in Greece was chaotic, and the government was in danger of being overthrown without the support of British troops. In the Pacific, the Indonesian movement in the Dutch East Indies, resisting the Netherlands, was in full swing.</p>
<p>The United States Launches a Compromise with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>In the second half of 1945, the international situation became increasingly tense; however, the crux of the situation was the incompatibility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If the situation was to be eased, it was necessary to start by improving the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. US Secretary of State Byrnes, having realized this, did not hesitate to bow to Stalin and first demonstrated the understanding between the US and the Soviet Union. Then, he further initiated the convening of a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, attempting to break the current deadlock through the coordination of the three countries. Therefore, the foreign ministers of the three countries - Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov - met in Moscow. At that time, the foreign ministers of the three countries adopted an attitude of "mutual tolerance for peace," and were willing to make concessions on any international issue, unlike the hardline stance at the five foreign ministers' meeting in London. Therefore, not long after the three foreign ministers' meeting opened, agreements were reached on various issues. According to the communiqué issued by the foreign ministers of the three countries, the results of the meeting were:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Japanese issue, the Far Eastern Advisory Committee will be reorganized into the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Chinese issue, the foreign ministers of the three countries reiterated the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Korean issue, the foreign ministers of the three countries agreed to place Korea under the trusteeship of the United States and the Soviet Union for a period of five years, with the United States in the south and the Soviet Union in the north.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of atomic energy, the three countries agreed to establish a committee to consider the various issues arising from the invention of atomic energy.</p>
<p>(5) The drafting of treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland:</p>
<p>(1) The treaty with Italy will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union;</p>
<p>(2) The treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union;</p>
<p>(3) The treaty with Finland will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(6) The issue of convening a 21-nation peace conference. When the draft treaty is completed, the Council of Foreign Ministers will invite the other 17 member states to hold a 21-nation peace conference to review the draft treaties with the five countries of the United States, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. This meeting must not be held before May 1, 1946.</p>
<p>The International Scene Gradually Becomes Bright</p>
<p>After the communiqué of the three foreign ministers' meeting was issued, US Secretary of State Byrnes returned to Washington, triumphantly reporting that the trip to Moscow had achieved significant results, and the resentment in the international community could be eliminated invisibly. A beautiful prospect was unfolded in front of peace. Soon, 1946 also began a glorious new year, and the United Nations General Assembly opened in London, making people in various countries extremely excited. Everyone thought that the world was saved, and there was hope for peace. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech to the House of Commons, said that "lasting world peace depends on the close cooperation of the United Nations and the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union," which was met with enthusiastic applause from the mediators in the Lower House.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly opened in London on January 10 of this year. Politicians and diplomats from various countries delivered grand speeches at the conference, describing their countries' ideals for world peace. They were all pleasing to the ear and enough to make people no longer believe that there were conflicts of interest between the great powers; but when these practical issues were brought up for discussion in the second stage, the situation was completely different. The representatives of various countries all took out their verbal swords and guns and showed their skills. Especially between Britain and the Soviet Union, for the sake of the Greek issue, postal car representatives argued until their faces were red and they were still unwilling to give up. Therefore, this ethereal prospect was also shattered.</p>
<p>However, when the United Nations General Assembly closed on February 10, the representatives of various countries still had some confidence in world peace. As British Prime Minister Attlee said in his closing speech, "The United Nations organization has now been placed on a solid foundation. The issues discussed by the conference, such as the secret of atomic energy and the world food panic, have all been initially resolved." The President of the General Assembly, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, fairly said: "All those who think that we can accomplish miracles will be disappointed; however, those who understand that the problems left over by the war can only be solved by joint action will be satisfied."</p>
<p>The first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly had such achievements, and it cannot be said that it was unsatisfactory. However, whether the United Nations organization can become an effective institution for maintaining world peace depends on the situation at the second meeting on September 23 of this year!</p>
<p>The United States Launches Another Four-Power Conference</p>
<p>The international situation did not ease because of the birth of the United Nations organization, but instead tended to become more tense in April of this year. US Secretary of State Byrnes, adhering to the original intention of peace, in order to restore the normal state of some European countries as soon as possible, especially Italy, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, and Hungary, on April 4, respectively sent notes to the authorities of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, expressing regret over the delay in the work of the next meeting of the four foreign ministers, and argued that the four foreign ministers should meet in Paris on April 25 to decide on the 21-nation peace conference before May 1. Britain and France first expressed their approval, and then the Soviet Union also expressed its agreement. Therefore, the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union met in Paris again on April 25.</p>
<p>From April 25 to the adjournment on May 16, the meeting was held for a total of 22 days. Although it cannot be said to have achieved significant results, considerable progress was made on some issues:</p>
<p>(1) Discussion of the issue of the treaty with Italy, the agreements reached include: 1. The issue of Italian reparations. The four foreign ministers agreed that Italy should pay 100 million US dollars in compensation to the Soviet Union; 2. The issue of the disposal of the national fleet. Except for some warships retained by Italy, the remaining warships were divided among the four powers. Greece and Yugoslavia also received some ships. 3. The Italian border issue: On the Italian-Austrian border issue, it was decided that the Upper Adige region of South Tyrol should be retained by Italy; on the French-Italian border issue, an investigation team was sent to conduct on-site inspections; the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands were returned to Greece. 4. The issue of the disposal of Italy's old colonies: The opinions of the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative advocated international trusteeship, that is, Tripoli was placed under the joint trusteeship of Italy and the Soviet Union, and Cyrenaica was placed under the joint trusteeship of Britain and Italy. After discussion, only a way to deal with it indefinitely could be adopted, and it would be discussed again in a few years.</p>
<p>(2) The Trieste Port issue: Yugoslavia demanded that Italy transfer the Venezia Giulia region and the Port of Trieste to Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union expressed its agreement; however, Britain and the United States expressed their opposition. Finally, France proposed a compromise solution, and the Port of Trieste was internationalized.</p>
<p>(3) On the Balkan issue, the four foreign ministers decided that Hungary should cede Outer Transylvania to Romania. The Romanian-Bulgarian border remained unchanged. As for the issue of navigation on the Danube, Britain and the United States advocated international control, but the Soviet Union firmly opposed it, so an agreement could not be reached.</p>
<p>(4) The issues of Germany and Austria were also discussed, but no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>The four foreign ministers had been meeting for 21 days and were already exhausted. If they did not adjourn for a month, they would repeat the same mistakes as the five foreign ministers' meeting in London. Therefore, US Secretary of State Byrnes, seeing that things were not going well, proposed an adjournment for a month and to reopen on June 16. Therefore, the first foreign ministers' meeting in Paris ended hastily. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>How to Commemorate the September 9th Victory</h3>
<p>— Ma Chaojun</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the "September 9th" victory. On this day last year, Japan, which sought to conquer our country, had to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender to our nation. This illustrates that violence is unreliable, and aggressors are bound to fail. It also demonstrates that justice will ultimately triumph over might, and humanity has gradually emerged from the long night into the light.</p>
<p>Despite a year of victory, both domestically and internationally, the overall situation remains turbulent, and lasting peace has not been secured. Many are disappointed and pessimistic. However, this world has existed for millions of years, while our lives span only a few decades, representing but a fleeting moment in the history of the world. If we become disappointed and pessimistic due to temporary setbacks in humanity's evolutionary process, we are being too impatient and shortsighted. The Father of the Nation (Sun Yat-sen) taught us that human evolution progresses from animality to humanity, and then to divinity. Humanity has not yet fully shed its animality, so wars still occur frequently. However, based on the trend of human evolution, humanity will one day completely shed its animality and reach complete humanity, and one day evolve into divinity.</p>
<p>Comparing this war with the last, the victorious nations in the previous war adopted a retaliatory attitude towards the defeated nations, repaying wrong with wrong, leading to endless cycles of war. In this war, the victorious nations adopted a transformative attitude towards the defeated nations, repaying wrong with virtue and eliminating the roots of war. After the previous war, countries established the League of Nations. After this war, countries established the United Nations. The latter organization is much more effective in preventing war. Moreover, the United States remained outside the former organization, while it not only participates in the latter but also supports it with all its strength. Currently, there are still many disputes in each meeting of the United Nations, but the world's problems are too complex, and disputes are unavoidable. Looking at the history of the United States, disputes were also fierce in the beginning after the victory of the War of Independence. Later, everyone patiently resolved them one by one, and then they cooperated harmoniously. We firmly believe that the disputes in the United Nations will gradually decrease and eventually disappear, and humanity will gradually cooperate harmoniously to seek the happiness of mankind together. The United Nations has resolved many disputes in its short one-year history, which proves the correctness of this prediction.</p>
<p>Speaking of our China, this war of resistance can be said to have the same importance as the Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution was to eliminate the Manchu Qing dynasty, which had enslaved us for more than two hundred years, while this war of resistance was to eliminate Japan, which intended to enslave us. The difficulties encountered after the success of the Xinhai Revolution were much greater than the hardships encountered after the victory of the War of Resistance. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not have as much destruction as the War of Resistance, the forces of counter-revolution were still all over the country, and the revolutionary forces were very small. However, the Father of the Nation disregarded all difficulties and resolutely fought against the counter-revolution, overthrowing Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor and eliminating Zhang Xun's restoration of the monarchy. Chairman Jiang, the successor of the Father of the Nation, also purged the warlords amidst great difficulties and hardships. The current revolutionary situation in our China is much better than in the early years of the Republic of China, and the people's knowledge has also been improved. They will no longer be deceived by political careerists who hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat. We firmly believe that all obstacles to the revolution will inevitably be cleared, and they will inevitably fail like Yuan Shikai and Zhang Xun. Some people have not shed blood, spent money, or contributed to the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they want to come out and compete for power and profit. They are simply the dregs of the nation and will undoubtedly be eliminated by the great era.</p>
<p>This world is in revolution, and our China is also in revolution. The victory of the War of Resistance is only a stage in the revolutionary process, and we must continue to struggle patiently. We achieved victory because we held the determination to resist Japan for a long time. We will succeed in building the country only if we hold the determination to build the country for a long time. During the Xinhai Revolution, everyone fantasized that after the revolution succeeded, China would immediately become a rich, strong, and prosperous country. They were unwilling to continue to struggle, so the fruits of the revolution were completely destroyed by counter-revolutionaries. During this War of Resistance, many people also fantasized that after the War of Resistance was won, China would immediately become a rich, strong, and prosperous country. This is also making the same mistake as after the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, in this year, many people are disappointed, pessimistic, and resentful because their fantasies have not been realized. This is really because we do not have a clear understanding of the revolutionary process.</p>
<p>On this day last year, the whole country was celebrating the victory like crazy. This was appropriate. The victory in the eight-year War of Resistance was too hard-won. Today this year, when we celebrate the victory, we need to be calmer. We must face reality and also look forward to the future. We must complete the great cause of nation-building with the spirit of the War of Resistance. We should be optimistic about the future of the world, and we should be even more optimistic about the future of China. It takes great hardship to win the War of Resistance, and it takes great hardship to succeed in building the country. We did not waver in our confidence that we would win the War of Resistance for the past eight years, so we achieved the final victory in the War of Resistance. We must have the same confidence that we will succeed in building the country from beginning to end, and then we will succeed in building the country. The world and China can only improve from a bad situation through our continuous struggle. There is no other miracle. On this day of celebrating victory, we must make the greatest determination, prepare to endure all kinds of hardships, and be willing to sacrifice everything to patiently build a new world and a new China, so that we can live up to the martyred soldiers and the dead compatriots, and live up to the descendants of all ages. This world is progressing, and China is also progressing. No one can stop it. Let those who did not die in the War of Resistance work together!</p>
<p>Hua Guo 499 on the ninth day of the third month of the 30th year of the Republic of China at noon</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Achievements in Japan in the Past Year: Infusing New Blood, Filling the Vacuum</h3>
<p>— Da Chun</p>
<p>The political winds of the United States have blown to the west coast of the Pacific. Many people are saying that General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in the Pacific, who is serving as the governor of occupied Japan, may participate in the next U.S. presidential election. During the last election, when General MacArthur was fighting in the Pacific, there were rumors that he would compete with the late President Roosevelt, but MacArthur denied it.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources in Tokyo: he wants to be the governor.</p>
<p>General observers say: his hope lies in achieving a "model occupation," just as he praised his troops stationed in Japan as a "model victorious army."</p>
<p>A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters also said: he still regards completing the mission of occupying Japan as his sole task.</p>
<p>Regardless of his political ambitions, this Supreme Commander of the United Nations has always put his full energy into his work in the year since he took office. He is doing it step by step according to his original plan, in order to achieve what he considers a perfect occupation. Setbacks are natural, but he is not discouraged. He seems to be prepared for everything.</p>
<p>Spirit of Hard Work</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors that MacArthur, at the age of sixty-six, is unable to cope with this heavy responsibility and intends to retire. However, in fact, he has not been sick in the past year except for a slight cold. According to his doctor, he is in very good health and there is no problem at all. In terms of work, he is still working as hard as he did at the beginning, working eighteen hours a day.</p>
<p>He not only works hard, but also likes his work. At the same time, the Japanese people also respect and love him. Many people regard MacArthur as a "liberator," and some even praise him as "amazing."</p>
<p>In the past year, MacArthur has left Japan once to attend the grand ceremony of Philippine independence. He has issued more than three thousand instructions to the Japanese people. He has had two secret meetings with the Japanese Emperor. In May, someone attempted to assassinate him, but he still goes in and out alone, and even if there are attendants, they are not armed.</p>
<p>MacArthur loves his wife the most. His son, Arthur, is only eight years old and can already write sheet music. The family of three lives in the American Embassy.</p>
<p>Work Schedule</p>
<p>MacArthur's daily work routine is roughly as follows: He leaves home before 11:00 a.m., drives to the Allied Headquarters, and goes directly to his office on the sixth floor to work. He goes home for lunch at 1:30 p.m. He goes back to the office at 5:00 p.m. and works until 7:30 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. He works seven days a week, but stipulates that his employees work forty hours a week.</p>
<p>In front of the Allied Headquarters, there are always many American sergeants, overseas Chinese, and Japanese people surrounding the area, admiring MacArthur's demeanor and taking pictures of him. When MacArthur first took office, an adjutant ordered these people to be prohibited from gathering, and specifically ordered the Japanese to stand only on the opposite street. Later, when MacArthur found out, he immediately canceled the order.</p>
<p>At first, MacArthur can be said to have adopted a "laissez-faire" policy towards the interaction between American soldiers and Japanese people. Later, although there were some restrictions, on the whole, there was freedom of communication between the Japanese and American people, because MacArthur believed that proper contact between the two sides could help promote democratic ideas.</p>
<p>Promoting Democracy</p>
<p>Promoting democracy is the main purpose of MacArthur's handling of Japan's post-war policy. In his "Victory Anniversary" message on September 2, MacArthur said:</p>
<p>"...The result of Japan's total defeat is not only the overthrow of its military force and the defeat of the country, but also the disintegration of the Japanese people's beliefs... Whether morally, psychologically, or superficially, Japan has become a completely and utterly vacuum. And what is being infused into this vacuum is the democratic way of life. The American soldiers brought their self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-discipline. The Japanese people not only saw but also experienced this spirit of the American soldiers, and this spirit reflects the highest training that American soldiers receive at home. As a result, the Japanese people gradually felt the mistakes of the past education, the failure of the past leaders, and the tragedy of the past beliefs. This feeling is deepening day by day, and finally brewed a spiritual revolution... This spiritual revolution is the greatest achievement of the occupation of Japan in the past year—the achievement of democratic forces in seeking lasting peace..."</p>
<h3>The Sun Flag Dims! The Scene of Signing the Surrender on the USS Missouri</h3>
<p>— Jun Mo</p>
<p>September 2, 1945, Sunday, the dawn over Tokyo Bay revealed a gray and hazy sky. The sun did not show its face, seeming to symbolize the decline of this Sun Flag empire. This was the day that Japan formally signed the surrender on the USS Missouri. The signing ceremony lasted only twenty minutes, but after the ceremony was over, suddenly, the sunlight came out of the clouds, shining again on the green waves, the glittering sea.</p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m., General MacArthur and Admiral Halsey walked onto the USS Missouri battleship. Various naval ships guarded the surroundings, sailing back and forth, and aircraft circled overhead on alert. The national flags of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France fluttered on the deck, and more than a hundred senior allied generals gathered on both sides of the ship's side, watching the open space on the deck in front of the captain's room. That was where the surrender instrument was to be signed, a small table covered with a green carpet placed there, with a chair placed in front and behind it.</p>
<p>At ten minutes to nine, representatives of the Allied nations appeared on the deck. In the distance, on the eastern horizon, there was the sound of faint thunder. Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, wearing a prosthetic leg, climbed up the ladder on the side of the USS Missouri, followed by Chief of Staff Yoshijiro Umezu. As the two silently walked past the Allied representatives, no one spoke to them, and no one greeted them. The representatives of the eleven countries all had stern faces.</p>
<p>General MacArthur, the host of the surrender ceremony, stood in the middle. On the left were General Wainwright and General Percival, and on the right were Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Halsey. The representatives of the other Allied nations, mostly wearing splendid and gorgeous uniforms, stood behind. At exactly nine o'clock, General MacArthur stepped forward and addressed the audience in front of the loudspeaker:</p>
<p>"Representatives of the major Allied powers are gathered here today to sign the agreement, restoring peace. The terms of surrender of the Japanese Empire have been recorded in this instrument of surrender. I, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, hereby solemnly declare: I shall assume my responsibility with a firm determination of fairness and tolerance, and I shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all terms of surrender are fully and faithfully fulfilled.</p>
<p>"I now invite the representatives of the Japanese Empire and the representatives of the Japanese Supreme General Staff to come forward and sign the instrument of surrender."</p>
<p>Mamoru Shigemitsu took off his top hat, walked to the table, and signed his name on the instrument of surrender, which was twelve inches long and eight inches wide.</p>
<p>Yoshijiro Umezu then walked to the table with an iron-faced expression, sat down, and hurriedly signed his name.</p>
<p>"The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers now signs on behalf of all nations fighting against Japan. Please General Wainwright and General Percival accompany me forward."</p>
<p>These two generals were heroes who fought hard for months in the Philippines after the Pearl Harbor incident and were finally captured by the Japanese army. Now, they have gotten their revenge.</p>
<p>MacArthur used five pens to sign his name. The first one was given to General Wainwright, the second one was given to General Percival, the third one was given to the U.S. government for preservation, the fourth one was given to West Point Military Academy, his alma mater, and the fifth one was a small red fountain pen, given to his wife.</p>
<p>After MacArthur finished signing, he stood up and announced: "The representative of the United States signs."</p>
<p>Nimitz walked to the table, quickly signed, and returned to his original position.</p>
<p>"The representative of China signs."</p>
<p>General Xu Yongchang, Chief of Military Orders, signed on behalf of China.</p>
<p>Then representatives of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand signed successively.</p>
<p>General MacArthur then stood in front of the loudspeaker and solemnly announced:</p>
<p>"Let us hope that the world returns to peace and remains peaceful forever. The ceremony is over."</p>
<p>More than two hundred and fifty bombers, led by fifty B-29 Superfortresses, and hundreds of fighters escorting them in formation, roared over the USS Missouri, seemingly demonstrating to the dispirited Japanese representatives. At this moment, the sun emerged from the clouds, illuminating the earth.</p>

<h3>The Cause and Effect of Japan's Surrender</h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>It has been a full year since Japan surrendered. I still remember on this day a year ago, Yasuji Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, formally signed the instrument of unconditional surrender of the Japanese army in the China theater in Nanjing. Japan, which had originally determined to defeat China to the point of kneeling, actually knelt down to China. Now we might as well review why Japan failed? Many people will say: Japan's failure was due to the atomic bomb. This answer is, of course, quite accurate. In fact, in the stage when the war was approaching its end, Japan's scientific technology had indeed fallen far behind the Allied nations, and the method of desperate resistance was already powerless.</p>
<p>But this is not the fundamental cause of the failure.</p>
<p>The Biggest Enemy is the Japanese Themselves</p>
<p>We should remember that Japan did indeed achieve considerable gains in the early stages of the war. So how did the initiative, which was originally in Japan's hands, fall into the hands of the Allied nations? A military strategist once said: "A country's greatest enemy is often itself." Japan's failure was indeed "self-inflicted."</p>
<p>Let's first talk about Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor: that attack not only angered the Americans, but also left the Japanese people at a loss. We only need to look at the date when Japan launched the Pacific War to see the imprudence of the Japanese military. Tojo and his followers did not launch an attack when Hitler began to attack the Soviet Union, nor did they respond until the German army besieged Stalingrad, but instead launched it on December 8, 1941, which was a huge mistake. Because at that time, the Soviet army was fighting back against the German army in the freezing cold, it did not receive the effectiveness of cooperating with the German war strategy. This was the first serious mistake made by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>The second mistake was the inconsistency of Japanese strategy. The goal of the Japanese Navy was to control the central and western Pacific, while the Army wanted to conquer the southeast and central Asia. The strategy of the Japanese Supreme Command was built on these two goals, and as a result, neither goal was achieved.</p>
<p>As a military strategist said, war is an art of concentration. If Japan had adhered to one goal at a time, she might have had a chance to turn things around. But the Japanese did not do this, and instead diverted their attention to two goals. By the time they realized their mistake, it was too late.</p>
<p>According to the joint strategy of the three Axis powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy: these three Axis countries should have tried to establish contact in certain places, but they did not take consistent action. When Rommel defeated the British army in Africa and advanced directly to Alexandria, the Japanese army should have launched a full-scale attack towards the Suez Canal area and built a bridge of the Axis powers in the Indian Ocean area. But the Japanese did not do this, but instead were busy bombing Darwin and launching attacks on the islands of the South Pacific. Another part of the soldiers were transferred to the Aleutian Islands. This chaotic pace formed a clear contrast with the planned and consistent action of the Allied nations.</p>
<p>The Third Mistake is Overconfidence</p>
<p>The third mistake Japan made was overconfidence. If the Japanese had allowed the Asian countries to gain true autonomy after conquering them, they might have easily created pro-Japanese sentiments in Asia. But the Japanese warlords in Tokyo believed that final victory was absolutely guaranteed, so they began to draft imperialist plans to exploit and control the people of various Asian regions. The Japanese worked hard to instill ideas of hatred for white people, but their own actions quickly aroused the hatred of the local people, which was tantamount to digging their own graves.</p>
<p>The mistakes made by the Japanese were not limited to the conquered countries. In fact, the people of Japan also deeply resented the government's actions. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese people thought they were engaged in a war of liberation, but the unfolding of the truth made them understand that all the propaganda was complete lies, which destroyed the people's beliefs. Once the belief in war is lost, there is no chance of victory at all.</p>
<p>Warmongers Have Learned a Profound Lesson</p>
<p>At the same time, war reports also made the Japanese people no longer believe the words of the Japanese military. For example, Japanese newspapers often talked about how the U.S. 58th Special Task Force had been "annihilated," but later this fleet actually hit Japan's doorstep. Therefore, the Japanese people gradually went from doubt to distrust, and from distrust to disappointment, regarding the victories that the military tried to exaggerate. By the time the Allied fleet approached the city and the situation was perilous, it was impossible to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>The above points are the fundamental reasons for Japan's failure. The extremism and lack of foresight of the Japanese military ultimately led to tragic results. The lessons of the Japanese can also serve as a profound lesson for all warmongers.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions</h3>
<p>Japan announced its surrender on August 11, 1945, while China formally accepted the surrender on September 9th, a gap of nearly a month. The chaotic situation in the occupied areas during this period can be imagined. Even after the surrender, the lack of a unified central policy for the reception and handling of enemy and puppet industries made consistent reception efforts difficult.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established on October 27, 1945, with only a few days for orders and preparation, a very rushed process. This was the earliest such organization established nationwide, with no precedent to follow. The six articles of the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Measures, announced by the Executive Yuan on October 24th, served as the sole guidelines for our operations.</p>
<p>Shanghai, the largest commercial port in the country and a wealthy region in the Southeast, had experienced numerous property disputes and transfers due to eight years of occupation and usurpation by the enemy and puppets. The situation was further complicated by the changes in the two months between the victory and the establishment of our Bureau. In the spring of 1946, we were ordered to expand our operations to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, making our mission even more arduous.</p>
<p>Of this one trillion income, about 40% was directly received after the Bureau's establishment. People often focus on the large number of enemy and puppet factories, unaware of the substantial amount of enemy and puppet materials. The safekeeping and handling of these materials were more challenging than that of the factories. The same applied to enemy and puppet real estate, which was also quite valuable. The income from investigations was almost unexpected; if we had been slightly negligent, it would have been largely dispersed.</p>
<p>The income from enemy and puppet industries was included in the national treasury budget, so we had to sell and remit as much as possible. Except for certain agencies authorized by the Executive Yuan to transfer funds or sell to other agencies, the rest had to be sold for cash. This was a policy decision made by the Executive Yuan in line with financial and economic policies, and we could only comply. By the end of August, we had remitted over 233.1 billion national currency yuan to the national treasury, not including the transfers and sales to other agencies.</p>
<p>The general situation of reception and handling was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Wharves and Warehouses: A total of 1,156 warehouses were taken over through customs. Most have been taken over, and the majority of stored materials have been entrusted to various agencies for sale. More than half of the warehouses have been emptied.</p>
<p>Factories: The Shanghai factories entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for reception totaled 480, of which 286 were purely enemy-owned. The most common types were machinery, chemical, and textile factories. Outside Shanghai, we received 162 factories in other parts of the region.</p>
<p>In accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan, some factories were transferred to the Resource Commission, the Textile Industry Management Committee, the National Silk Company, the China Tobacco Company, and the Ministry of Health. Others were returned to Allied merchants and Chinese citizens. In principle, they should be put back into operation first, and the rest were offered for sale through bidding, either with the factory buildings and land or just the equipment. Recently, we were ordered to give priority to factories returning from the rear for purchase or lease, as a form of preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Real Estate and Furniture: We received over 2,100 enemy and puppet houses and over 6.3 million mu of land, with an estimated total value of about 120 billion yuan. Many real estate properties were returned to Chinese citizens and Allied expatriates after reception. All enemy and puppet real estate is sold in principle, and we are currently organizing auctions. We received over 38,000 pieces of furniture. There are still houses that belong to traitors out there.</p>
<p>Fuel: Fuel and oils, including gasoline, aviation gasoline, and lubricating oil, totaling over 2,000 barrels each, were entrusted to the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. There were also kerosene, diesel oil, and alcohol, which are liquid fuels. Solid fuels included over 700,000 tons of bituminous coal, anthracite coal, charcoal, and firewood. Recently, the handling of liquid fuels was transferred to the China Petroleum Corporation.</p>
<p>Ships: We entrusted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with the reception of 35 river steamers and one ocean-going vessel. Other small steamers, sailing junks, motorboats, iron barges, and civilian boats totaled over 1,200. The former Naval Headquarters received over 100 vessels, some of which were transferred and others retained. No fewer than 400 vessels were returned.</p>
<p>Vehicles: We entrusted the Highway Administration with the reception of over 600 trucks, over 60 passenger cars, and over 1,300 cars. After some were sold to various agencies and returned to their owners, the rest were auctioned.</p>
<p>Military Supplies, Aircraft, and Warships</p>
<p>The types and quantities of military supplies were extremely numerous and were all taken over by the Ministry of National Defense. The Aviation Committee received seven airlines, factories and airfields, and 170 aircraft. The Navy received 21 warships.</p>
<p>Food: Food was received by the Ministry of Food and was all sold through bidding.</p>
<p>Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Animal Husbandry: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry received a total of 55 units, including farms, animal husbandry, fisheries, cotton production, sericulture, and animal epidemic prevention organizations.</p>
<p>Educational and Cultural Institutions: The Ministry of Education and the Municipal Education Bureau received universities and colleges, research institutes, libraries, enemy-established middle schools, puppet-established middle schools, enemy-established primary schools, sports fields, zoos, cinemas, and theaters. The Central Propaganda Department received a total of 200 units, including newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, film studios, bookstores, stationery stores, and printing factories.</p>
<p>Trading Companies: The Central Trust Bureau was entrusted with the reception of 263 enemy and puppet-operated trading companies, and their materials were sorted and sold separately.</p>
<p>Small Shops: The city government received and handled 463 small shops. Recently, these have been transferred to the Handling Bureau.</p>
<p>Gold, Silver, Coins, and Securities: This category included the assets received by various agencies, including the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China), as well as the Central Trust and Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau. Gold, silver, U.S. dollars, and puppet currency were the most common.</p>
<p>Raw Materials and Finished Products: Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cotton, and rayon were the most abundant, followed by chemical industrial raw materials, paper, hardware, and machine parts. These were entrusted for sale or sold at reduced prices to state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>German Properties: The largest was Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, with received gold and silver valued at 200 million yuan and inventory valued at 20 billion yuan, totaling about 20.7 billion yuan along with other assets. The inventory received from Bayer Pharmaceutical was valued at 2.5 billion yuan. The combined inventory and other assets of other German trading houses, such as Carlowitz &amp; Co., totaled about 3.9 billion yuan. The above totaled 28.2 billion yuan. All received Western medicines and dyes were sorted, packaged, and sold.</p>
<p>Traitor Properties: Traitor properties were originally handled by the former Shanghai Traitor Property Liquidation Committee and later transferred to our Bureau. Our Bureau handled 531 traitor property cases. The handover of seized traitor properties by the Military Intelligence Bureau was largely completed. The received assets included houses, land, stocks, ornaments, furniture, and other items such as pianos, automobiles, books, and antiques.</p>
<p>The above can be considered a reception account. In addition, there are a few tasks worth supplementing.</p>
<p>The cleaning of factories and wharf warehouses was very heavy, and there was no absolute standard for valuation, so it was inevitable that people would criticize us. However, after explanation or on-the-spot investigation, the truth would become clear.</p>
<p>The investigation work has long been over, because the nature of the work is to accept secret reports and investigate concealment. If you are not careful, it will disturb the people. This is what we always told ourselves to pay attention to in the past. Some informants always feel that the bonuses are issued too slowly or too little, but according to case-by-case investigations, there are special reasons, and it is not the case that the undertakers deliberately suppressed it, which can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Resolving property rights disputes is also a heavy task. A total of more than 4,000 cases require investigating facts, searching for evidence, and summoning hostages, again and again, to ensure fairness and justice. Most of the meetings of the review committee were to discuss property rights disputes. Sometimes the parties said that we were dealing with them slowly, but unfortunately we were not able to let him check the entire record of the process, otherwise he would definitely understand and understand.</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of materials, we strive to clear the treasury quickly and contribute to the national treasury revenue. In addition, pay attention to assisting in stabilizing prices. Although the Bureau receives a lot of materials, it is ultimately limited. According to the active situation of floating capital in Shanghai, we must proceed carefully, keep an eye on market changes, and sell dynamically, otherwise, the materials will fall into the hands of speculators, and the people will not only not get practical benefits, but will be even more oppressed by high prices. Therefore, in terms of methods, flat sales, auctions, and tenders are all adopted. In terms of quantity and type, each time the sell-off is different and unequal, so that speculators cannot take advantage of it. Sometimes, the society criticizes us, and we rarely argue. For example, when rice prices soared this spring, the society criticized us for why we didn't sell a large amount of rice. In fact, we didn't receive much rice at all, but if we said that at the time, to what extent would the rice price jump, everyone can imagine. There are many things like this. We are honest and have nothing to be ashamed of, but for the benefit of the country and the government, we will never argue for a day's length.</p>
<p>The work of handling traitor properties is now beginning. The Traitor Property Handling Committee has been established, and it is jointly organized by court colleagues and local leaders. This institution can exist independently in the future, until the business is completely over.</p>
<p>Reviewing the work of the past ten months, under the guidance of the Executive Yuan and the Review Committee, and with the assistance of all sectors of society, we have finally overcome many difficulties. If the work of the handling bureau still has some achievements, it should be attributed to everyone's cooperation.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the business of the Handling Bureau can be largely completed in three or four months, and the agency is also preparing to shrink at any time. During this period, we still sincerely hope that all sectors will give us instructions at any time!</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Handling Bureau, the first step was to follow the Yuanling decree to cancel the original receiving and handling agencies in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Private Industrial and Commercial Processing Committee, the Shanghai Real Estate Processing Committee, the Third Army Military Supplies Receiving Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Party and Government Receiving Committee, and the Shanghai Area Traitor Production Clearing Committee, and request their cancellation. All businesses are transferred to the Bureau for processing. This handover work was not completed smoothly and quickly, because very few individuals or agencies inevitably believed that after receiving it, it was their own, and they would never report it again, and some did not ask the Japanese for the original inventory at the beginning, or refused to hand over the original inventory received. All kinds of trivial problems require repeated negotiations to solve, so some industries and materials have not been transferred to the Bureau until May and June this year. During this period, it is more like doing diplomacy than processing.</p>
<p>The six handling measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan are the highest principles. Many supplementary regulations and measures are still needed in the implementation. At the same time, we are determined to do everything fairly and reasonably, and do everything on track without exception. Therefore, many rules and regulations have been formulated one after another. These are carefully researched and drafted by experts or competent colleagues, and prudently decided by the Review Committee, and implemented after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. In the future, our handling of cases must seek to be in line with these regulations and methods. At the same time, new rules and regulations are formulated to adapt to newly occurring facts.</p>
<p>Speaking of the received industries and materials, the estimated total value is more than one trillion yuan. If analyzed according to type, (1) cash is 1.5 billion yuan, (2) raw materials and finished products are 300 billion yuan, (3) gold and silver jewelry is 90 billion yuan, (4) factories are 300 billion yuan, (5) real estate is 100 billion yuan, (6) wharf warehouses are 100 billion yuan, (7) German properties are 31 billion yuan, (8) ships are 10 billion yuan, (9) food is 9.7 billion yuan, (10) financial institutions are 800 million yuan, (11) cultural facilities are 5.5 billion yuan, (12) aquatic products are 2.5 billion yuan, (13) fuel is 2.3 billion yuan, (14) vehicles are 2.3 billion yuan, (15) coins are 2.3 billion yuan, (16) securities are 1.8 billion yuan, (17) furniture supply is 1.8 billion yuan, and (18) farms are 1.5 billion yuan. In addition, the traitor property part and the military supplies part have not been listed. If analyzed according to the nature of the source, roughly estimated, the one that belongs to purely enemy production is 50% to 60%, the one that belongs to puppet production is 30%, and the rest accounts for about 10%.</p>

<h3>National Affairs in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Xu Woming</p>
<p>China's political situation in the past year since the Japanese invaders surrendered has revolved around two historically significant documents: (1) the formulation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" and the establishment of other related agreements; (2) Chairman Chiang's announcement in Lushan on the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender. The formulation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" and the establishment of other related agreements are the most meaningful achievements of the past year. To formulate and implement this plan, we have seen Chairman Chiang's talks with CCP leader Mao Zedong in the autumn in the capital, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the meetings of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and in the military field, the basic plan established by the Military Subcommittee and the dispatch of mediation and execution teams to various places to carry out mediation, as well as the issuance and extension of the ceasefire order, and so on. All these activities occupied most of the early period of the past year. However, the agreements obtained through the hard work of all parties have encountered very great difficulties in their implementation or execution. Except for the government's unilateral implementation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction," it has not been implemented to this day. "Nationalization of the army" is still just an ideal, and "political democratization" is still just a goal. Moreover, because of the "negotiations," it has evolved into a protracted situation of so-called "negotiating while fighting." Since the beginning of spring, Changchun and Harbin have been successively occupied by the Communist army, and large-scale offensives have been launched in "Northern Jiangsu" and "Central Plains." Wars are everywhere, and people are struggling to make a living. The national trunk traffic, except for the Nanjing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Hankou areas, is still blocked and has not been restored, so the country and the people feel the hardship. Under this situation, Chairman Chiang issued a historically significant announcement in Lushan on the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender, pointing out the crux of the current situation and the six points of the policy for dealing with the current situation in the future, which is the most important document of the later period of the past year. This newspaper once praised it as "the great charter for national revival," which shows the importance of its relationship. Recently, there has been a plan to form a five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government, hoping to fundamentally solve the current situation in the reorganization of the National Government. Although this plan for a five-person group is a recent event, its significance still cannot exceed the two historically significant documents mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference was undoubtedly the most significant political event of the past year. The convening of this conference originated from the talks between the government and the CCP representatives after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang invited Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, to come to the capital to discuss national affairs. Mao responded to the invitation and arrived in Chongqing on August 28 last year to meet with the Chairman. He held many talks, and at the same time, both sides sent representatives to conduct more detailed discussions in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere. On the National Day celebration, both sides jointly issued a memorandum of the talks in Chongqing. The first point was that both sides "unanimously believed that the Chinese Anti-Japanese War has ended victoriously, and a new stage of peaceful national construction is about to begin. We must work together to build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong on the basis of peace, unity, and unification, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of Chairman Chiang." Both sides also agreed that the political democratization, nationalization of the army, and equality and legality of parties advocated by Chairman Chiang are the only way to achieve peaceful national construction. The second point was that both sides "unanimously believed that the period of political tutelage should be ended quickly and constitutional government should be implemented. The necessary steps should be taken first, and the National Government should convene a political consultative conference, inviting representatives of various parties and social elites to discuss national affairs, discuss plans for peaceful national construction, and discuss various issues related to the convening of the National Assembly...." According to the spirit of this key point, the Political Consultative Conference was convened in the capital on January 10 this year, with eight representatives from the Kuomintang, seven representatives from the Communist Party, five representatives from the Chinese Youth Party, nine representatives from the Democratic League of China, and nine "non-party representatives," also known as "social elites." The conference concluded successfully on January 31.</p>
<p>At the closing session of the "Political Consultative Conference," in Chairman Chiang's opening speech, the Chairman "believed that among the various proposals (the various proposals established by the Political Consultative Conference), the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" is the basis and center of the various plans, because each provision of this plan is unusually complete, meets the requirements of the times, is full of unity, and is full of democracy, and is indeed the most suitable outline for crossing into the constitutional period. With this outline, from the central government to the local governments across the country, from all parties and factions and social leaders to compatriots all over the country, we have a common standard to abide by. Since all parties and factions that participated in this conference jointly discussed and jointly agreed on this outline, and will participate in the government to jointly implement it, we must keep our promises to compatriots across the country and be responsible for our actions, first from the fact that there is a real performance of compliance, and must penetrate its national character so that it can be universally realized." This "Outline for Peaceful National Construction," which was established through consultation by various parties and factions and social elites, stipulates in its general principles: "(1) Adhering to the Three Principles of the People as the highest guiding principle for national construction; (2) Uniting all national forces under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build a unified, free, and democratic new China; (3) Confirming the "political democratization," "nationalization of the army," and equality and legality of parties advocated by Chairman Chiang as the only way to achieve peaceful national construction; (4) Resolving disputes by political means to maintain the peaceful development of the country." The military aspects are to ensure the unity of army formation and military orders, army restructuring, separation of army and party, separation of army and civilians, and all national armies should be effectively reduced in accordance with the army reorganization plan, all of which are to achieve the purpose of "nationalization of the army."</p>
<p>As for "political democratization," there are agreements on enriching the National Government, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution to accommodate people from all walks of life with the National Government as the highest decision-making body. Among them, regarding the draft constitution, some advocated adopting a "bicameral system" and a "cabinet system," but it was only a reference for the National Assembly and had no binding power on the National Assembly itself. As for the National Assembly part, after several twists and turns, an agreement was finally reached, that is, adding 700 new representatives, of which 230 representatives were from the Kuomintang, 200 from the Communist Party, 100 from the Democratic League, 100 from the Youth Party, and 70 from social elites. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed to give 10 names to the Democratic League within their quotas, that is, the Kuomintang was 220, the Communist Party was 190, and the Democratic League was 120. After the agreement was reached, the National Government ordered the National Assembly to be convened in Nanjing on May 5 this year. Unexpectedly, the CCP deliberately destroyed it, and other parties followed suit and refused to submit the list of representatives, so the National Assembly had to be postponed again and again, and it was postponed to November 12 this year. In addition, the government representatives and the Communist Party representatives signed a method for stopping conflicts and restoring traffic with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>After the "Political Consultative Conference" had reached an agreement, the National Government officially announced on May 5 this year that it would return the capital to Nanjing. At the same time, it announced the Prime Minister and paid homage to the Mausoleum. The government, which had moved west for eight years, returned to the capital established by the founding father. However, the political sky in the country did not become brighter because of the government's return to the capital. Since the return of the capital, although various groups have maintained contact, the actual situation has become increasingly worse, resulting in a situation of "talking and fighting," which has dragged on for months without results. The ink of the "reorganization" and "unified reorganization" agreements was not dry, not only did the military orders and political orders fail to unify the CCP army, but they also attacked everywhere. The domestic traffic was still blocked as before. The ceasefire order was extended indefinitely, but the act of fighting had not been reduced at all. The people's suffering was increasing, and the political deadlock had not been broken. Chairman Chiang issued an announcement to the people of the country in Lushan on the eve of the anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender, pointing out the crux of the domestic situation in the past year, that the end lies in the failure of the CCP to implement the various agreements established and deliberately obstruct and expand the difficulties. Regarding the policy for dealing with the current situation in the future, the Chairman pointed out six points: "(1) We will never delay the process of ending political tutelage and starting constitutional government because of any obstacles. The National Assembly on November 12 must be convened as scheduled. (2) We must sincerely abide by and strive to promote all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the draft constitution, we only seek to gather better opinions from all parties and provide them to the National Assembly for discussion and decision, so as to produce a perfect and feasible constitution. (3) We must quickly realize the expansion of the government's foundation and invite people from all parties and non-partisan parties to participate, and take the Outline for Peaceful National Construction as the guideline for governance. (4) Regarding the cessation of conflict, we still fail to abide by the original agreement and faithfully fulfill it, and we do not demand that the Communist army withdraw from the areas it occupied after the ceasefire order, but only ask them to withdraw from some areas that have already posed a threat to peace and obstructed traffic. (5) We will still adopt the method of political solution to political disputes. As long as the Communist Party army faithfully implements the agreement to stop the conflict and restore traffic, invites mediation, and implements unified reorganization, so that the nationalization of the army will not be in vain. As soon as this layer is guaranteed, the government can discuss all outstanding issues with it concretely at any time. (6) The most urgent demand of the people at present is to live and work in peace and contentment, so the government must do its best to eliminate the threat of peace, and must also fulfill its duties to protect the lives, property and safety of the people.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of Chairman Jiang's announcement, it has shown a clear direction for dealing with the current situation in the future, making people feel as if there is "no way to go when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, and there is another village where the flowers are bright." Based on the spirit of this announcement, the two emissaries, Marshall and Sze, traveled between Beijing and Pyongyang despite their old age and hot weather, and ran around to establish a plan to form a five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, whose task is limited to discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee and not other matters. The government has also appointed Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng as representatives, and the envoy also agreed to serve as chairman. However, the Communist Party initially demanded "veto power" and then raised other conditions as a threat. As a result, the plan is now on the verge of miscarriage. However, the envoy is still not afraid of hard work and travels back and forth. Whether the group can be established, whether an agreement can be reached after its establishment, and whether the agreement can be faithfully implemented after the agreement is reached, will have to be proved by future developments.</p>
<p>In summary, the crux of the domestic political situation in the past year lies in the failure of the CCP to implement the established agreements. In order to take care of the people's need for rest and recuperation after the war, the government spared no effort to bear the responsibility with extreme tolerance and sincerely negotiated with the CCP and people from all parties and non-partisan parties. However, the results of these negotiations were expected to become texts due to the CCP's delay in abiding by and implementing them. So what is the value of the establishment of the agreement? Today, when we review the domestic political situation in the past year, for the sake of the people, we want to appeal again to the CCP not to be an enemy of the people. For the established agreements, we must abide by and implement them, and for the future national construction, we rely on sincere unity. The world political situation in the year after the war was turbulent and unstable. In this turbulent and unstable world, all parties must cooperate sincerely to devote themselves to the revival of China.</p>
<h3>The International Political Turmoil of the Past Year (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>The Mutual Mistrust Deepens</p>
<p>During the month-long recess of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the mistrust between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union deepened. The United States displeased the Soviet Union in the following ways: (1) The U.S. seemed unwilling to grant loans to Poland; (2) Britain and the U.S. protested the situation in Romania; (3) Britain and the U.S. interfered in the case of Yugoslav General Mihailović, who was accused of collaborating with the enemy; (4) German ships traveling on the Danube River were detained by U.S. occupation forces; (5) According to the Potsdam Agreement, Germany was required to use certain industrial equipment as reparations, but the U.S. military authorities ordered a halt to the removal of such equipment; (6) British troops stationed in Greece refused to withdraw. On the Soviet side, there were also unfriendly actions towards Britain and the U.S.: (1) The Soviet Union strengthened its close relations with all countries within its sphere of influence; the signing of the Soviet-Polish agreement proved this; (2) Yugoslav Marshal Tito visited Moscow, and his anti-American stance became more blatant; (3) Denmark also showed a tendency to develop trade with the East; (4) Soviet troops also moved from Austria to Germany to reinforce defenses; (5) The Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not participate in the British victory parade; (6) The Soviet Union's ambitions regarding the Turkish Straits had become a well-known fact; (7) Soviet activities in southern Iran threatened British interests.</p>
<p>The Conference Reopens After a Month</p>
<p>The month-long recess ended quickly, and the Four Foreign Ministers met again in Paris on June 16. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, with the greatest determination to achieve peace, returned to Paris. Before his departure, President Truman personally saw him off at the airport, making Byrnes feel even more strongly that the Council of Foreign Ministers "must succeed and cannot fail." However, upon arriving in Paris, the atmosphere of optimism was very thin. Nevertheless, Byrnes' sole objective was to ensure that the 21-nation peace conference could be held, which would be a great achievement in itself, and other issues could be discussed at the conference.</p>
<p>At the second Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States firmly advocated that the 21-nation peace conference should be held in Paris on July 28. However, the Soviet representative expressed dissent, believing that the 21-nation peace conference could not be convened until all outstanding issues had been agreed upon. After several rounds of verbal sparring, the Soviet Union finally relented and agreed in principle to the British and American proposals. However, disputes arose again when discussing the countries to be invited to the 21-nation peace conference and its rules of procedure. Fortunately, France repeatedly mediated, preventing a breakdown. They also stepped up their work and completed five draft peace treaties, namely the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. By the time of the closing on July 15, the following achievements had been made:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the peace conference, the Four Foreign Ministers decided that the 21-nation peace conference would be held in Paris on July 28 to discuss the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland; the German and Austrian questions would not be discussed for the time being.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the peace treaties, the Four Foreign Ministers unanimously passed the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland.</p>
<p>Although there were heated debates and constant waves during the second Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the fact that it was able to achieve the above two major results in the end cannot be said to be an improvement over previous conferences.</p>
<p>On July 28, 1946, representatives from 21 countries gathered at the Luxembourg Palace in France, and the first post-war peace conference finally opened under the world's watchful eyes. By the time the author is writing this, it has been almost forty days. Although verbal battles have been frequent and waves have been surging, with one wave barely subsiding before another rises, the people of the world who long for peace are hoping for the success of the peace conference. We also believe that the future of the Paris Peace Conference is bright and that it will soon come to a satisfactory conclusion. (September 6)</p>
<h3>Post-Surrender Relief and Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was established in January of the 34th year (1945), which was eight months before the victory. Because the enemy forces blockaded our country's coastline, all transportation during these eight months had to rely on air transport over the Hump.</p>
<p>The supplies we requested from the United Nations for assistance totaled four million tons, but the total weight of supplies that arrived in our country by air transport during the eight months before the victory was only about one hundred tons. Therefore, we may as well say that almost all the post-surrender relief and rehabilitation work was done after the surrender.</p>
<p>Because Japan's surrender came somewhat suddenly, many planned projects were affected. UNRRA originally had a fairly complete plan for implementing relief and rehabilitation in China, but because this victory came somewhat unexpectedly, some disconnects occurred. For example, in order to get supplies to China as quickly as possible, many ships that were en route temporarily changed course and diverted supplies intended for the military to China. This was the good intention of the Allied nations towards our country, and we can only be grateful. However, the supplies that were delivered were not necessarily what the general public in our country, who were in urgent need of relief, needed. Secondly, because we ourselves had not been able to restore transportation equipment and transportation lines to a sufficient extent, the supplies were inevitably released more slowly, leading to criticism from UNRRA, and even the Director-General of UNRRA, La Guardia, issued an order to stop shipping supplies to China.</p>
<p>If we could have achieved peaceful unification after the victory, this temporary disconnect should have been quickly adjusted. However, what followed was a nationwide conflagration that quickly spread beyond control. UNRRA suffered its greatest test at this time—unfortunately, it was unable to cope with this enormous blow!</p>
<p>New disaster areas emerged, and the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu became an important issue. According to UNRRA's original plan, this part of the relief was not as serious as it is now.</p>
<p>The restoration of transportation was made almost impossible by the war. In northern Shandong, for example, relief supplies could not pass through layers of fire. Incidents of troops intercepting supplies occurred frequently, and dozens of relief workers had already died in the line of duty. Ships, vehicles, and laborers were often requisitioned, and relief and rehabilitation in many areas had entered a state of paralysis. Moreover, UNRRA's assistance to our country had been greatly reduced. The food we urgently needed amounted to less than 40% of the required amount. And this 40% of the total amount could not be transported to the areas that should have received emergency relief due to transportation difficulties and the lack of transportation equipment!</p>
<p>At the same time, UNRRA's organization was established in accordance with the original plan, and the deadline for the work was quite tight. Many things could not be prepared in time. For example, UNRRA's communication network in various relief areas was not yet set up. For example, the Shanghai headquarters has never received a telegram sent by UNRRA's Yantai office. Under such circumstances, how can we "seize the time"?</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that UNRRA's working period may be extended, which is indeed a slightly reassuring piece of news. However, if the situation cannot be quickly clarified, the future of relief and rehabilitation work is still bleak.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the "Double Ninth" Victory: Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>"We must have confidence that our nation's future will always be bright and promising, and that no resistance can stop our renaissance. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have dedicated myself to the revolution, experienced countless hardships, and led the war of resistance for more than eight years. I absolutely cannot allow the life of the Republic of China, which has been exchanged for the blood and sacrifice of countless soldiers and civilians, to be easily destroyed. I cannot bear to cause further suffering to the people who have survived the war, nor will I change my established steps of seeking peaceful unification and democracy due to any provocation or obstruction. I will surely follow my conscience, fulfill my duty, and lead my compatriots throughout the country to advance towards the road of national construction in accordance with procedures and established practices. I express my sincere wishes to my compatriots on the occasion of today's commemoration, and I deeply hope that we will be of one mind and work hard to eliminate the disasters of our country, preserve the lifeline of our nation, and jointly complete the great cause of revolution and national construction." (Respectfully recorded from Chairman Chiang's Message to the Nation)</p>
<h3>To Awaken and to Build the Nation</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance. As we commemorate this day, we feel boundless excitement and boundless sorrow. The pain of our country's decades of suffering from enemy aggression has been completely washed away since this day last year. Our nation has joined the ranks of the five great powers, which truly makes us feel infinitely excited. I remember last year when I received the news of Japan's surrender in Chongqing, how many people were cheering and rejoicing, all wanting to return to their hometowns as soon as possible and reunite with their families. Everyone was looking forward to a happy life after peace. However, a year has passed since the victory, and many people are still drifting abroad, their hardships and suffering greater than during the war. Thinking about it is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>After the victory, in order to seek a reasonable political solution, safeguard the fruits of victory, enable the people to recuperate and rebuild, and complete the great cause of national construction as soon as possible, Chairman Chiang convened consultations and signed the Summary of the Double Tenth Negotiations. Later, he convened the Political Consultative Conference to consult various opinions. The government, making the greatest concessions, completed the Consultative Conference, promulgated the Program for National Reconstruction, signed the Plan for Military Reorganization, and agreed on measures to restore transportation. After a year of consultation, written agreements have been signed one after another, but what is the actual situation? If we do not implement them conscientiously, we will squander the fruits of victory and betray the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance. How can we be worthy of our friendly nations who sincerely assisted us!</p>
<p>"A woman must insult herself before others insult her." We should deeply understand the meaning of this old saying. Half of the national humiliation of the past decades was due to aggression, and half was also due to self-humiliation. Our position in the international community declined day by day, unequal treaties were signed one after another, and we lived a semi-colonial life. The Japanese further advanced step by step, finally creating the July 7th Incident, wanting to achieve their goal of destroying our entire country in one fell swoop. At that time, I was responsible for military and political affairs in Beiping. Following the instructions of the central government, I negotiated with the Japanese on the principle of not ceding sovereignty or humiliating the country. Unfortunately, Japan's policy of destroying our country was already established, and all methods could not achieve peace. Therefore, I led the troops to resist first. The whole country fought a bloody war for eight years and finally won the final victory. This June, I was ordered to travel east to testify. Seeing those war criminals who bullied us nine years ago made us feel infinite excitement and emotion. Of course, Japan had a predetermined plan and steps to invade us. If our whole country could have been united and worked hard in the past to resist foreign aggression, would the September 18th Incident and the July 7th Incident have occurred? It is worthy of research. If people from all walks of life could have worked together after our victory in the War of Resistance to jointly build the nation, at the very least, the country would not be in its current state.</p>
<p>I recently traveled in Japan and heard that Japan may recover even faster than us. I feel infinite worry in my heart. If we work together to build the nation, we are still afraid that we will not be able to catch up. If we create obstacles ourselves and undermine each other, when will we be able to catch up with the progress of this great era? Now we have the materials we have received and the assistance of the Allied nations. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rejuvenate and build the nation. How can we bear to sit idly by and give it up?</p>
<p>I have always advocated peaceful unification because the people are too poor and cannot withstand war. The economy and society are scarred and cannot withstand war even more. The government has this basic understanding, so it spares no effort to seek peace and insists on resolving disputes through political means. This should be the case from the standpoint of the nation and the people. From the standpoint of the various parties, there is only a way to follow this peaceful path. Everyone is shouting for the country and for the nation. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, everyone could unite for the country. Why can't they cooperate after the victory?</p>
<p>The basic requirements of the people are to live and work in peace. Looking back over the past decades, how many days of peace and happiness have there been? Aren't these decades of chaos enough to teach us a lesson? After the First World War, we lost a good opportunity to regain Korea. Do we still want the country to be invaded and occupied again and the people to be massacred? The people are the true masters of the country. We must respect the interests of the people in order to strive for the survival of the country. After eight years of hard fighting, the people should rest and recuperate. We need peace, we need to build the nation, and we must not miss the opportunity again, causing harm to our descendants. I hope that everyone will wake up, grasp reality, be vigilant, and put the interests of the nation and the people above all else. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we will jointly complete the mission of national construction, so as not to be ashamed of commemorating this great day.</p>
<p>Crime During the Concession Era</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Security is Improving After the Victory</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Shanghai's high number and complexity of criminal cases during the concession era were unparalleled among domestic cities and rare even abroad. Bruce, the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the former Public Concession, stated in the first issue of the 1928 London Police Journal that Shanghai's rising Chinese nationalism, poor domestic security, and the lack of isolation between the concession and other areas made the frequency of crime and the difficulty of police work even greater than in England. In fact, the rise of Chinese nationalism had nothing to do with the amount of crime. The number of criminal cases in Nanjing and Hangzhou in the interior was far less than in Shanghai at the time; security was much better than in Shanghai. Only the unequal treaty system was the fundamental reason for Shanghai's high and complex crime rate in the past.</p>
<p>1. Consular jurisdiction protected many international career criminals. In his "Shanghai: Paradise of Adventurers," Eddie Miller described many international career criminals who were expelled from other countries, had nowhere to go, and could easily land in Shanghai and continue their criminal careers. Many diplomats, pastors, and bankers made a living by issuing fake passports, selling arms and opium, manufacturing gambling equipment, and protecting casinos, fraud, and murder. Chinese law could not prevent or punish these crimes, and they were protected by the tangible and intangible consular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>2. The existence of the concession system fragmented Shanghai's police power, increased the convenience of criminals escaping, and increased the difficulty of criminal police work. As stated in "The Concessions and China's Destiny," the concession "was a country within China." In the past, Shanghai had two different "countries" at the same time in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Government: the Public Concession and the French Concession. For example, if a crime was committed on Dongdaming Road in the Public Concession, the criminal could cross the street south to Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, and the constables of the Public Concession could not arrest him. If a crime was committed in a Chinese shop next to the extraterritorial road, the Chinese police could not exercise police power once the criminal stepped out of the door onto the road. This deformed and unreasonable system only provided the greatest convenience and encouragement to criminals and gave those responsible for security a cruel mockery and insurmountable difficulties.</p>
<p>3. The colonial rule method is the best breeding ground for crime. The concession authorities only paid attention to military and economic control and ignored the organization (population was never statistically recorded), education, social life, welfare, and moral guidance of the vast majority of Chinese people in the concession. The unlimited development of opium dens, casinos, prostitution, and speculative commerce was intentionally or unintentionally allowed, which destroyed the old morality of society, made the people increasingly corrupt and degenerate, and cultivated countless criminal factors. In such a society, reducing crime is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>4. Past crime statistics (based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report records, the French Concession and the Municipal Public Security Bureau's records are incomplete and omitted)</p>
<p>A. Total number of criminal cases</p>
<p>1937: 19,558 cases</p>
<p>1938: 19,064 cases</p>
<p>1939: 27,848 cases</p>
<p>1940: 30,980 cases</p>
<p>1941: 26,024 cases</p>
<p>Average annual: 20,469 cases, average monthly: 1,706 cases</p>
<p>B. Kidnapping (including completed and attempted)</p>
<p>1940: 80 cases</p>
<p>Average annual: 66 cases, average monthly: 5.5 cases</p>
<p>C. Robbery</p>
<p>1938: 684 cases</p>
<p>1939: 1,233 cases</p>
<p>1940: 2,275 cases</p>
<p>1941: 1,428 cases</p>
<p>1941: 52 cases</p>
<p>Average annual: 1,405 cases, average monthly: 117 cases</p>
<p>D. Theft</p>
<p>1937: 13,238 cases</p>
<p>1938: 12,723 cases</p>
<p>1939: 17,572 cases</p>
<p>Average annual: 14,511 cases, average monthly: 1,209 cases</p>
<p>(At that time, the population of the Public Concession accounted for about two-thirds of the total population of Shanghai, and currently accounts for half of the total population of Shanghai)</p>
<p>Current Security Situation</p>
<p>The entire Shanghai was recovered starting from September 12 of last year. The concessions and consular jurisdiction that were produced under 100 years of unequal treaties no longer exist. At the same time, the Shanghai security authorities have also shouldered unprecedentedly important responsibilities. The eight years of war of resistance and destruction by the enemy and puppets have caused Shanghai's material and spiritual aspects to suffer unprecedented losses. In addition, at the beginning of the recovery, factories have not fully resumed operation, unemployment has increased, the currency has changed, and the cost of living has not fallen. During the repatriation period, there were many scattered soldiers and deserters, and firearms scattered among the people have not yet been registered. The mentality of some people in Shanghai is that, on the one hand, they are too eager for governance, have too high expectations, and demand perfection. On the other hand, the remaining incorrect prejudices from the past have not been completely abandoned. Therefore, the security in the first six months after the initial recovery only sought stability and only managed to ensure that the number of crimes did not exceed the number of crimes during the concession era. After half a year, the record of criminal cases has gradually decreased and returned to normal. Not only is it less than in the past, but it is also much less than at the beginning of the recovery.</p>
<p>(1) Total number of criminal cases (from September 12 of last year to the end of August of this year): 19,394 cases</p>
<p>(2) Kidnapping (from October of last year to the end of August of this year): 15 cases occurred, 17 cases solved (including 2 cases solved that occurred in neighboring counties)</p>
<p>(3) Robbery</p>
<p>October 34: 118 cases, November: 142 cases, December: 131 cases</p>
<p>January 35: 106 cases, February: 92 cases, March: 88 cases</p>
<p>Average monthly for the first six months after the recovery: 113 cases</p>
<p>April 35: 101 cases, May: 75 cases, June: 81 cases, July: 63 cases, August: 32 cases</p>
<p>Average monthly for the five months after half a year: 70 cases, the least in August, 110 cases less than the highest in November of last year</p>
<p>(4) Theft</p>
<p>October 34: 100 cases, November: 1342 cases, December: 1447 cases</p>
<p>January 35: 1254 cases, February: 813 cases, March: 1030 cases</p>
<p>Average monthly for the first six months after the recovery: 1149 cases</p>
<p>April 35: 1019 cases, May: 980 cases, June: 861 cases, July: 731 cases, August: 571 cases</p>
<p>Average monthly for the five months after half a year: 832 cases (theft accounted for 39.25% of all repeat offenders and 70.27% of habitual offenders)</p>
<p>(5) Criminals apprehended (from September 12 of last year to the end of August):</p>
<p>23 kidnappers, 347 robbers</p>
<p>4669 thieves, 1856 opium addicts</p>
<p>(According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau)</p>
<p>Representatives of the Japanese Surrender</p>
<p>(1) General Yasuji Okamura (fourth from right), Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army stationed in China. (2) Lieutenant General Asasaburo Kobayashi (third from right), Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army. (3) Vice Admiral Ryosaburo Fukuda (fifth from right), Commander of the Japanese Fleet. (4) Takeo Imai (second from right). (5) Sawayama (sixth from right). (6) Kiyoshi Ogasawara (first from right). (7) Masao Misawa (seventh from right).</p>
<h3>Review and Outlook on Criminal Cases</h3>
<p>1. From the two types of statistics above, those of the former Public Concession and the current Municipal Police Bureau, I get the following two concepts:</p>
<p>(1) The current number of crimes in the entire Shanghai is only equivalent to one district of the former Public Concession.</p>
<p>(2) Important criminal crimes are now less than in one district of the Public Concession and are tending to decrease month by month.</p>
<p>2. The reasons are nothing more than:</p>
<p>(1) Complete police power reduces the difficulty of work and makes it difficult for criminals to escape.</p>
<p>(2) Unified command of the military and police strengthens effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Heavy penalties for bandits make criminals afraid to try easily.</p>
<p>(4) Social life is more serious than during the concession era, reducing criminal factors.</p>
<p>3. However, Shanghai society has been affected by 100 years of unequal treaties. A few people's residual lifestyles and psychology have not been completely forgotten for a while. The inevitable difficulties after the war cannot be completely resolved in a short time. At the same time, the security organs after the recovery still have many areas that must be improved in terms of strength, equipment, technology, personnel training, discipline, and quality. On the other hand, it is not enough to reduce crime only through passive legal sanctions. There must be an active advocacy of the rule of law in society, and further cooperation and sympathy with the security organs can ensure future security. Only when Shanghai's security can be stabilized can Shanghai embark on the path of proper prosperity and construction.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Crimes</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>They all committed a series of bloody crimes. The people of the United Nations, for the painful lessons of the past and to lay the foundation for world peace in the future, must settle this blood debt with them from beginning to end!</p>
<p>It has been a year since the victory. Looking back on the past eight years—no, fourteen years, or even fifty-two years—the old accounts of the Japanese militarists' invasion of China, in today's painful reflection, must undoubtedly be thoroughly settled with these instigators of war.</p>
<p>Starting from the September 18th Incident, these war criminals, Araki, Doihara, Konoe, Matsui, Hashimoto, Tojo, Koiso… harboring ambitions to invade China and the world, successively created countless incidents: the Rehe Incident, the January 28th Incident, the Inner Mongolia Incident, the Tanggu Truce, the He-Umezu Agreement, the Zhangbei Incident, the Fengtai Incident, the Lugouqiao Incident, the August 13th Incident, the Nanjing Massacre, massacres in various parts of central and southern China, the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Pearl Harbor Incident, until the full-scale outbreak of the Pacific War. During the war, how many more crimes did they commit—policies of massacre, policies of poisoning, policies of corruption, looting of grain and materials, establishing puppet governments… these bloody facts brought extreme anger and terror to people all over the world.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered last August, the Chinese authorities had already decided on the disposition of Japanese war criminals. According to the surrender report of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, it was stipulated that Japanese war criminals in China should be investigated and arrested by the Chief Executives of each marching headquarters and war zone, according to the list issued by the Military Affairs Commission. Those who had returned to Japan were to be requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have the US government order the Supreme Commander of the US occupying forces to arrest and hand them over. Captured war criminals were to be held in war criminal detention centers in various districts and tried by military tribunals. So far, hundreds of people, including Kumaichi Yamanaka and Takashi Sakai, have been arrested and tried; several people, including Tameichi Isoya and Hisao Tani, have been handed over to our country by the US military.</p>
<p>After General MacArthur led the US military to land in Japan, he immediately ordered the arrest of Japanese war criminals, including Doihara, Koiso, and Hiranuma. On May 3rd of this year, the United Nations International Tribunal opened in Tokyo, with the Chief Prosecutor being Keenan (US), and the prosecutors being Xiang Zherong (China), Jarr (UK), Golunsky (USSR), Mansfield (Australia), Nolan (Canada), Audo (France), Mulder (Netherlands), Quillin (New Zealand), Menon, and Jarr (India), and Lopez (Philippines), totaling eleven people. These war criminals, whose crimes deserved more than just execution, were charged with launching wars of aggression, violating international treaties, enslaving and abusing the people of other countries, and colluding with Nazi fascist war criminals, and were subjected to detailed interrogations. In repeated trials, the conspiracy of Japan's aggression against the East Asian continent over the years was further exposed.</p>
<p>Please note the following: the war criminals on trial have shown no remorse! They have even questioned the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal, they still believe that the responsible authorities of a country should not be regarded as war criminals internationally, and they even claimed that the atomic bombing was a "more heinous murder"!</p>
<p>Another noteworthy fact: to date, not all Japanese war criminals have been tried by the Tokyo International Tribunal, and many are still freely holding public office and engaging in political activities. Moreover, the International Tribunal has not yet tried a single Japanese zaibatsu, and these zaibatsu are precisely the instigators of Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to this group of war criminals who have slipped through the net, and must completely arrest them, subject them to the sanctions of the United Nations, and not let one of them escape.</p>
<p>Today, on the anniversary of the victory, we will only make public the crimes of these important war criminals before the people of China and the world:—</p>
<h3>A Sign of Defeat: Hideki Tojo</h3>
<p>The mastermind of the Pacific War, Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, attempted suicide on September 10th of last year but failed and is now confined in Omori Prison, where he continues to be tried in the United Nations Tribunal.</p>
<p>Tojo has always been praised as a practitioner of the "Hakko Ichiu" spirit. From 1935 to 1936, he served as commander of the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie and chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in Northeast China. When Konoe formed his cabinet, Tojo became Vice Minister of the Army, then Minister of the Army. On December 2, 1942, he took the stage to form a cabinet, serving as Prime Minister and Minister of the Army. On December 7th of the same month, he launched the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States overnight, until he resigned in July 1944 after the Pacific War turned unfavorable. During this time, he also served as Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Munitions, and Chief of the General Staff.</p>
<p>In summary, the major crimes he committed during his tenure as Prime Minister include: first and foremost, invading Britain and the United States and launching the Pacific War. He also organized the Imperial General Headquarters and personally led the army, navy, and air force to direct overall operations. Second, he used the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a slogan to entice the Wang Jingwei regime and the "Manchukuo," as well as puppet organizations in India, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, to declare war on Britain and the United States. Third, he colluded with Germany and Italy to endanger world peace. Finally, he established large-scale invasion institutions in China and massacred our people. During the ongoing trial at the Tokyo International Tribunal, evidence was presented regarding Tojo's orders to mistreat prisoners of war; his circular to various concentration camps stated: "Do not be easily swayed by humanitarianism or personal feelings towards prisoners of war. All prisoners must be strictly disciplined. Give prisoners what they deserve, so that the Japanese people can recognize the excellent character of the Japanese nation and the special rights and glory enjoyed by the Japanese nation." Such inhumane and absurd remarks are outrageous!</p>
<p>Due to Tojo's aggressive militarism and launching of wars, he sent the Japanese people to the battlefield as cannon fodder, which ultimately led Japan to a state of utter defeat and irretrievable disaster. Therefore, today's Tojo will not only be severely sanctioned by the United Nations, but the Japanese people should also rise up to settle his crimes!</p>
<h3>The Number One Demon: Kenji Doihara</h3>
<p>Unveiling the historical materials of the Japanese invaders' invasion of China over the past fifteen years, Doihara is truly the chief culprit. In the guise of a militarist henchman, he was the first to launch an armed invasion of China. In September 1931, he served as the head of the Special Service Agency in Northeast China and, together with Itagaki and others, created the Mukden Incident, using force to occupy Northeast China, creating a "Kingly Way Paradise" and implementing the so-called "Enlightenment Reform in Northeast China," and establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. At that time, the behind-the-scenes wire-puller for Puyi was none other than this Kenji Doihara.</p>
<p>Doihara was the organizer of the intelligence network on the Asian continent. After the Japanese army forcibly occupied Rehe and established a puppet regime in Inner Mongolia, Doihara crossed the Great Wall and went south to launch a huge conspiracy to invade North China. In March 1933, the Japanese army occupied Rehe, and in April, they challenged and attacked various passes of our Great Wall. In May, they pressed on Tianjin, resulting in the establishment of the "Tanggu Truce." In June 1935, the so-called "Zhangbei Incident" was caused by Japanese officers and soldiers forcibly passing through Zhangjiakou. Afterwards, the Doihara-Qin Dechun Agreement was signed, driving out the central forces of Chahar and supporting Prince De. This was followed by the Fengtai Incident in September 1936. Doihara took one step further and plotted to establish a "North China Autonomous Government," trying to entice our generals to become chairmen of the "North China Autonomous Government," promising assistance regarding the military and economy of North China, but we refused. Doihara then exerted strong pressure on the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. On the one hand, he enticed Yin Rugeng to organize the "Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee," with himself as the supreme advisor. As a result of repeated oppression, the Lugouqiao Incident finally broke out, and a full-scale war of resistance began.</p>
<p>Before July 7th, all smuggling, drug trafficking, and forced labor in the Pingjin area were the work of Doihara. He monopolized all special forces in North China, and no traitor was not under his command. After the outbreak of the war, he also carried out vicious massacres in the capacity of commander of the 5th Army Corps. From 1940 to 1943, he served as a supreme military councilor, and later served as the director-general of the Army Aviation, commander-in-chief of the Eastern Army of Japan, commander-in-chief of the 7th Area Army in Singapore, and director-general of Army Education. Each time Japan invaded China and opened up new battlefields, Doihara arranged the invasion conspiracy in advance, so he is truly the number one demon among war criminals.</p>
<p>Such a demon should naturally no longer be allowed to roam free. When the United Nations issued its first list of wanted war criminals, Doihara had no choice but to surrender and go to prison.</p>
<p>Doihara is Japan's "Himmler" and Northeast China's "Lawrence." Now that the day of thorough reckoning has arrived, we must interrogate him about all the spy conspiracy cells he has deployed in our country and ruthlessly eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Massacre Culprit: Iwane Matsui</h3>
<p>Iwane Matsui was the person in charge of the heinous atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing. It is estimated that the Japanese army committed more than 20,000 cases of rape in Nanjing at that time. More than 12,000 innocent Chinese civilians were slaughtered, and countless cases of drug trafficking and open robbery occurred. Such bestial acts are truly appalling.</p>
<p>Matsui is now also on trial in the Tokyo International Tribunal. He is still trying to evade responsibility for the Nanjing Incident, claiming: "I believe that the discipline of the Japanese army is very good!" But the public law is clear, and the responsibility that a murderer should bear can be predicted.</p>
<p>Matsui has always been a person with favorable connections in the Japanese army, advocating the Asia Association and forming his own faction. He is familiar with the situation in our country and speaks the language, and is a famous China expert. In 1931, he attended the Geneva Conference as a representative of the Japanese army. In 1933, he served as a supreme military councilor. In 1934, he also visited China to promote his "Pan-Asianism." When the war broke out in 1937, Matsui was transferred to China and commanded the war in Shanghai. The Nanjing Massacre was his "achievement" after he captured Nanjing! At this time, he had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army, from October 1937 to February 1938.</p>
<p>After returning to Japan, he also advocated "Asian Monroeism" and served as an advisor to the Cabinet, advisor to the Asia League, advisor to the Greater Political Assistance Society's East Asia Affairs Department, and president of the East Asia Development Company.</p>
<p>The once-commanding leader of the "Imperial Army," before bowing to the International Tribunal, has he ever thought about where his former prestige is now?</p>
<h3>The Korean Cowardly Tiger: Kuniaki Koiso</h3>
<p>The so-called "Korean Tiger" Kuniaki Koiso is a rising pro-war militarist in Japan. Before 1930, he was still an unimportant supporting role in the group of Japanese militarists. In 1932, he colluded with Doihara, Honjo Shigeru, and Itagaki to invade our Northeast China, and was suddenly appointed as the "Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army." After leaving office in 1934, he was transferred to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Army for two years. Afterwards, he served as Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Hiranuma Cabinet and the Yonai Cabinet. In 1942, when the situation in the Pacific became critical, he took office as the Governor-General of Korea, suppressing the Korean patriotic movement, training Korean youths, and forcing them to fight for Japan. His vigorous and resolute actions gained the attention of the Japanese government, hence the name "Korean Tiger."</p>
<p>When Japan suffered setbacks in the Pacific War and the Tojo cabinet collapsed, Koiso came forward to "accept the mandate and form a cabinet." In his first interview with reporters on the day he formed his cabinet, he said: "In order to achieve the final victory in the war, the Yamato race must cooperate in wartime between the command and the national affairs. The power of the command is higher than everything else, in order to promote national policy." In the Pacific War, he abused the Kamikaze attack teams and mobilized all officers and soldiers to make a desperate gamble. In the war against China, he always harbored the ambition to attack the capital, Chongqing, while forcing small and weak nations such as India, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam to get involved in the war, and looting abundant resources in Southeast Asia to provide huge expenses for the war.</p>
<p>But Koiso's "efforts" were ultimately ineffective, and instead led Japan more quickly into a "dead end." The Japanese army encountered strong resistance from the Allied forces in the Pacific, and the military suffered repeated defeats. The Koiso cabinet had to announce its resignation in April 1945.</p>
<p>What else does this "Korean Tiger" have to say in court today?</p>
<h3>Standard Militarism: Sadao Araki</h3>
<p>Sadao Araki, the culprit of the Northeast Incident, is a standard Japanese militarist who advocates aggressive militarism. In 1931, he served as the Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the Army General Staff Headquarters. In December 1931, he took office as the Minister of the Army in the Inukai Cabinet and plotted the Northeast Incident. According to Araki's testimony in the International Tribunal: "After I took office as Minister of the Army, I studied the policy of occupying the four provinces to solve the Manchurian problem. With the approval of the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister, it was decided that the Prime Minister would seek the approval of the Privy Council. The Cabinet then resolved to 'pacify' the territory of Zhang Xueliang!" His conspiracy is evident.</p>
<p>In the Saito Cabinet, Araki continued to serve as Minister of the Army. In 1932, he presided over the signing of the Japan-"Manchukuo" Protocol. Emperor Hirohito also personally attended the meeting.</p>
<p>In 1933, he was promoted to Army General. From 1934 to 1936, he served as a supreme military councilor, and the following year, he served as an advisor to the Cabinet's Committee on China Affairs, openly interfering in our country's internal affairs. In the Konoe Cabinet and the Hiranuma Cabinet, he served as Minister of Education, controlling everything. His power was higher than that of the Prime Minister, and he was virtually one of the leaders of Japanese fascism. In 1940, he also served as an advisor to the Cabinet.</p>
<p>Araki is not only an extreme hater of communism, but also the most powerful figure in anti-Soviet activities. From 1918 to 1922, when Japan intervened in the Far East, he presided over the espionage work in the Soviet territory of the Far East.</p>
<p>After the Allied forces landed in Japan, Araki and Shimada were arrested by General MacArthur at the same time. When the International Tribunal opened, it had already investigated and clarified Araki's past crimes of invading Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and North China. It is expected that a verdict will be reached soon.</p>
<h3>Star of a Hundred Defeats: Shunroku Hata</h3>
<p>Most of the famous Japanese militarists have served in the Northeast. Shunroku Hata is also one of the members of the "Northeast militarist clique." He graduated from the Army Military Academy and was skilled in the art of "general swordsmanship." In 1933, he served as a division commander in the three northeastern provinces. In 1935, he served as the Director of the Army Aviation Bureau. After the February 26th Incident in Japan, Terauchi Hisaichi was responsible for purifying the army, Araki Sadao stepped down, and Yanagawa Heisuke succeeded him as Minister of the Army. Hata and Yanagawa were classmates at the Army University, so he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Army. From then on, he had smooth sailing and was sent to China twice, serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Army.</p>
<p>Hata Shunroku testified in the International Tribunal: "I succeeded General Matsui as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army from February to November 1938, and succeeded General Nishio as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army from 1941 to 1944. After Matsui captured Nanjing, my main purpose was to 'pacify' the occupied areas."</p>
<p>Hata Shunroku came to China twice to command operations and encountered fierce resistance from our army, suffering huge losses. He instigated his subordinates to slaughter our people everywhere in order to vent their anger. In the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, Central China, and Southern China, the great bloodshed of the Chinese people created an extremely cruel page in history.</p>
<p>During the time that Hata Shunroku came to China twice, he was once reassigned as the Minister of the Army in the Abe Cabinet. He sent General Nishio Shuzo to China to fight and launched the so-called "October Offensive," using the strength of seven divisions to attack Changsha fiercely. Who knew that they would be deeply trapped and defeated under Mount Mufu, with more than half of them killed. Nishio was therefore dismissed, and Hata had to resign from his position as Minister of the Army.</p>
<h3>Double War Criminal: Teiichi Suzuki</h3>
<p>Teiichi Suzuki, who is being tried in the United Nations International Tribunal this time, is a double war criminal of the United Nations. He launched the war of aggression against China and participated in launching the Pacific War. His crimes are truly too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Suzuki is one of the vanguards of the Japanese young officers. In December 1938, he came to China to serve as the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Asia Development Board, and once served as the acting Director-General of the Board until the Asia Development Board was dissolved in April 1941.</p>
<p>After the Asia Development Board was abolished, Suzuki returned to Japan. From 1941 to January 1943, he successively served as the Director-General of the Planning Board and Minister without Portfolio in the Konoe Cabinet and the Tojo Cabinet, participating in the planning of the war against Britain and the United States. In 1944, he also served as an advisor to the Cabinet and a director of the Great Japan Political Assistance Society. After the victory, he surrendered and went to prison.</p>
<h3>The Cost of Japan's War of Aggression</h3>
<p>According to the recent investigation report of the First and Second Demobilization Committees: Japan lost 1,174,476 military personnel in the eight-year war of aggression, including 777,076 army personnel and 397,400 naval personnel. Among the army deaths, 725,076 were killed in action, and 52,000 drowned. Among the naval deaths, 280 died in the China war zone, and 397,120 died in the Pacific war zone. (United Press)</p>

<h3>Preparations and Prospects for the Shanghai Stock Market</h3>
<p>— Du Yong</p>
<p>In the summer of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the government, recognizing the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai and the lack of legitimate channels for idle capital, resolved to establish the Shanghai Stock Market. In early June, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly appointed nine individuals, namely Wang Zhixin, Gu Shanchang, Yu Huanzheng, Xu Jilong, Xu Weiming, Qu Jigang, Xia Pingfang, Qian Yongming, and myself, to form the Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Stock Exchange. I was designated as the Chairman and Mr. Wang Zhixin as the Vice Chairman. The committee was established on the 4th of the month and held its first meeting. To gather diverse perspectives and facilitate collaboration, several subcommittees were established: "Regulations and Qualification Review for Brokers," "Standards for Listed Securities and Review of Listed Securities," "Formulation of Regulations for Securities Trading," and "Preparations for the Resumption of the Stock Exchange." In addition to the committee members' participation, experts were invited as advisors. The progress of their work is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding broker applications, a public announcement was made, and the application process began on July 9th, ending on the 21st. The subcommittee first reviewed the applications and then presented them to the full committee. Based on three criteria—education, experience, and financial strength—the committee verified the documents, paying close attention to the applicant's reputation and the organization and current status of their firm. After several meetings, a list of qualified applicants, along with their documents, was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.</p>
<p>(2) For the review of listed securities, a public announcement was made to accept applications. The subcommittee reviewed each application based on its balance sheet, registration procedures, and other relevant matters. The full committee then made a decision and submitted it for approval.</p>
<p>(3) The formulation of various rules for securities trading was based on the current regulations of domestic and foreign exchanges, relevant laws, and the situation in Shanghai. The subcommittee drafted the rules, which were then submitted to the full committee for approval. The aim was to ensure compliance with the law and alignment with the facts, to improve the standards of the securities industry and to adhere to the principles of curbing speculation.</p>
<p>(4) The Shanghai Stock Exchange already existed under Chinese merchants. During the period of enemy occupation, it was utilized, but the capital scope was very small. Therefore, the committee was ordered to prepare the market and establish the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with a capital of 1 billion yuan. The original Chinese shareholders subscribed for 60% of the shares, and the remaining shares were taken up by the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Credit Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The existing market of Chinese merchants was expanded and rebuilt into both a bond and a stock market, with stocks traded on the ground floor and bonds on the mezzanine. The third floor housed the offices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Ministry ordered an early resumption of business, the task was urgent and complex, but difficulties were overcome. On September 3rd, the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange was held, announcing its establishment. The work and mission of the Preparatory Committee came to an end. Subsequently, the work was handed over to the exchange. I had the honor of chairing the Preparatory Committee, from the time I was ordered to prepare the exchange until the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, a total of three months. Thanks to the guidance of President Song (Ziwen) and the efforts of all the committee members in the review of all projects and regulations, this only stock market in China was fortunately completed. This is the story of the preparation. Securities are closely related to finance, and their interests are intertwined. This is even more evident in the development of modern financial business. The method of circulation is simple, and the procedure of safekeeping is convenient. Furthermore, the issuance of national bonds and the expansion and contraction of currency have an indirect and increasing impact on the national financial economy. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to the stock market, as its organization and management can affect the soundness of finance and indirectly affect the government's economic policies. Thus, its mission and responsibility are extremely important. The Shanghai market was the origin of securities in China. Individuals advanced to group organizations, and then a stock market was established. The Shanghai market is relatively complete. Because Shanghai is the financial center of the country, it is most necessary to utilize this market. Therefore, from 1919 to 1937, the former Chinese Stock Exchange market underwrote public bonds exceeding hundreds of millions. However, the importance of the stock market lies not only in the sale of bonds, but also in promoting the circulation of industrial and commercial stocks. In the past, the Chinese people's concept of investing in stocks was based on family and friendship, and the organizers were limited by their own interests. The accounting and auditing systems were not perfect, so the scope of the organization was not expanded, and stock circulation was not easy to gain trust. Currently, the total capital of industrial and commercial enterprises is hundreds of millions, the organization is becoming increasingly perfect, the accounting is striving for accuracy, and the style of raising capital has changed to become more open. The establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange this time was carried out in accordance with the law. Those who apply for listing are also enthusiastic. On the one hand, more and more people are investing in stocks, which shows that the concepts and interests of the public have changed. The establishment of the stock portion of the stock market is a matter of urgency. Therefore, in the current outlook, investors should carefully select to determine their choices, the organizers should be frank and diligent to promote their business, and the exchange should strictly enforce its laws and regulations with an impartial attitude, in order to guide investment and prevent speculation, so that the circulation of bonds and stocks is unimpeded, and the three parties each fulfill their duties, then the future of China's stock market can be gradually perfected.</p>
<h3>Letter to Colleagues at the Shanghai Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhixin</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Stock Exchange was ordered to prepare, I followed Chairman Du (Yong) and, with the cooperation of all colleagues, was able to witness the official opening today. Now, I am mistakenly entrusted with the concurrent position of General Manager by the recommendation of Chairman Du. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to work together with the majority of colleagues whom I did not know in the past!</p>
<p>The stock exchange is one of the most important institutions in the financial sector. Its task is to establish a modern capital market to guide social capital into the right channels, to assist national economic construction, and to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. Therefore, the responsibility is extremely important, and its success or failure has a huge impact. I have always devoted myself to the banking business and have been unfamiliar with the business of the stock exchange. I am deeply aware of the fear of treading on thin ice with this heavy responsibility, and I have to place high hopes on all colleagues.</p>
<p>Colleagues will take this post as a lifelong career, and first of all, we must clearly understand the mission of this exchange, and then improve our concept of serving this exchange. In the past, the society had some misunderstandings about the purpose of the stock exchange, mistaking investment for speculation, and only knowing how to benefit themselves and ignoring the social impact. Employees, influenced by what they saw and heard, often misused the convenience of their positions and followed the trend, thus mistakenly believing that serving this exchange was to gain an advantageous position. It is hoped that this kind of erroneous concept will disappear with time. We should link our personal honor, disgrace, interests and damage with the rise and fall of the service organization. At the beginning of the new life of this exchange, we must lay a noble and pure service belief in our minds.</p>
<p>Since we are serving in this exchange, we should abide by the discipline of this exchange and be loyal to our respective duties. Colleagues should be able to understand this meaning without explanation. However, how to cultivate a good custom of abiding by discipline and being responsible should start from a strict life. Only those who live a strict life can have a healthy mind and improve their talents. Only those with a healthy mind can abide by discipline, and only those who can constantly improve their talents can be responsible. This point must be understood and practiced by colleagues. I will set an example by myself. At the same time, I will gradually promote measures that should be taken to ensure the stable life of the colleagues in this exchange to the best of my ability. Some of the colleagues are employed from the former Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, and some are selected through examinations or recruited from various parties. They all have many years of experience in serving the society and will be able to perform their duties happily. With such a neat lineup, operating this meaningful business, I believe we will not fail the expectations of the government and the society. However, colleagues must work together, unite and cooperate, and eliminate the distinction between old and new, and the view of being separated, so that success can be achieved. This is what I hope colleagues should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Although the colleagues of this exchange come from all parties, the selection and abandonment is absolutely based on talent. In the service process, the performance of work and the morality of service are the criteria for elimination and promotion. All those who have excellent work performance and a strict life, this exchange will guarantee that they can be secure in their position and hold their position for a long time. If they do not plan this way, but only seek to survive in personnel relations, the facts will surely deny us. Employing people with talent and ability will be the consistent policy of this exchange.</p>
<p>The organization of this exchange is temporarily divided into one office and four departments, namely, the Secretariat, the Business Department, the Finance Department, the Research and Investigation Department, and the General Affairs Department. Each department is divided into various sections, and all colleagues are distributed in various parts of the work, forming an organic whole. Although the responsibilities of each person are different in weight, the importance of each person's completion of their task is no different. We hope that each of us will stand on our posts, do our best, and work together to promote the business of this exchange to perfection.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my work with my colleagues, I would like to state a few hopes, which I would like to share with you!</p>

<h3>A Letter to Compatriots from All Walks of Life on the Occasion of the Opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>— Du Yong</p>
<p>To all compatriots from all walks of life:</p>
<p>By the order of President Song (Ziwen) and the ministers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, I, along with the gentlemen of the Shanghai Stock Market Preparatory Committee, have been preparing for the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange for more than three months. The preparatory work is basically completed, and the shareholders' meeting has been convened in accordance with the law to elect directors and supervisors. I, Yong, am not talented and have been elected as the chairman of the board. I am afraid of falling short of expectations. Today, on the occasion of the opening, I would like to express my feelings to all compatriots from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The mission of this exchange is extremely important this time. The country has been in the Anti-Japanese War for many years, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. The most important of all construction is the collection of funds. Under our country's economic national policy, the best way to collect funds is to issue securities through the modern stock market to absorb idle capital, and to use idle capital by buying and selling securities. Only in this way can entrepreneurs use social capital to increase their productivity; only in this way can investors measure their capital and needs, select and purchase securities, and sell them at any time without worrying about stagnation. The establishment of this exchange is to meet the needs of both parties and make contributions to the cause of national construction. This is the first.</p>
<p>At present, there is an overabundance of idle capital in the society, and there is no proper way out. Speculative frenzy and price fluctuations follow one after another, which has a profound and significant impact on people's livelihoods. After the opening of this exchange, we hope to sell idle capital and guide it into legitimate enterprises, so that the financial market can be stabilized and the livelihood of the people can be saved from distress. This is the second.</p>
<p>This time, the qualification of brokers and the assessment of securities in Shanghai are very strict, the internal organization and personnel are also very solemn, various rules and regulations are carefully formulated, and the scale of equipment is unique in the east. In the future, under strict management and correct leadership, we hope to strictly abide by government laws and regulations, establish a modern capital market mechanism, thereby promote national policy and benefit finance. This is the third.</p>
<p>The above three are the missions of this exchange. However, it is difficult to say it, and it is difficult to do it. To complete it, on the one hand, we rely on the efforts of the colleagues of this exchange, and on the other hand, we rely on the assistance of people from all walks of life. One must start low to climb high, and start near to travel far. At the beginning of the opening, I am overwhelmed with fear of walking on thin ice. If we can obtain the love and support of all compatriots, and achieve a brilliant future, it will not only be the good fortune of this exchange, but also the good fortune of the country and society. Du Yong, Chairman of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, respectfully informs you on September 9, 1946.</p>
<h3>How to Improve the Shanghai Stock Exchange Market</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>One hundred and seventy-three years after the establishment of the London Stock Exchange on July 15, 1773, our Shanghai Stock Exchange is also ready and should be announced to open for business. It has been twenty-seven years since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock and Goods Exchange in 1919. During this period, the twists and turns of the exchange business, the complexity of the securities market collapse, and the rise and fall of the industrial and commercial circles, even a brief recollection, are full of emotions. And with the current deep industrial and commercial crisis, and the urgent need for funds to flow into the black market usury, the stock exchange is suitable for the opening of the market with great fanfare at this time, we really can't help but pay close attention to it. The first article of its articles of association reveals the purpose of its business, "To promote business investment, promote economic recovery, establish a sound stock market, and support industrial and commercial enterprises." The vision is far-reaching and deeply resonates with my heart. However, the established securities market must be sound before business investment can be promoted, industrial and commercial enterprises can be supported, and economic recovery can be promoted. Therefore, to put it simply, how should the stock exchange, as a stock market, pay attention to its soundness, so that it can be beneficial to the society and beneficial to the shareholders. We can't help but contribute our opinions.</p>
<p>First, the father's inheritance procedures must be regularized. The securities market is not necessarily the stock exchange. As long as there are securities, there will be transactions. However, the general trading procedures may endanger the market and hinder the society. Therefore, the Stock Exchange Law is formulated and the stock exchange is established to centralize and range it, and strive to make the buying, selling and delivery procedures conform to the law and suitable for the commercial situation. The exchange system is to correct the perfunctoriness and other abuses in trading with the spirit of the rule of law. Those who study the exchange system often praise the United Kingdom, because it was the earliest to create the business, the most developed, and the spirit of the rule of law is the most perfect. However, every time I read the history of the exchange, since the Roya Exchange in 1567, the trading procedures have been rectified many times. When the technology of Amsterdam was introduced and the fixed-term delivery was implemented, it was not able to enter the right track. And every time speculation was rampant, there was still much criticism. In 1697, the parliament even established a strict law to ban it, and then selected brokers and eliminated the scum. The unrestrained nature of the Change Alley road transaction, compared with the general lane transactions in our country, is difficult to control, and can be said to be the same in the East and the West. Those who have read Mrs. Centive's play "A. Bald Strake fora Wife" in 1717 will have a lot of aftertaste. It was not until 1773 that the London Stock Exchange was established in Sweeting's Alley, and then there was a concrete broker association and a sound trading system. As a result, the trading procedures gradually entered the right track, and there was the establishment of the new building of the Capel Court Exchange in 1801. However, it is still constantly improving and striving to make the trading procedures strictly disciplined. The advanced countries' exchange system has today's achievements, and its experience is like this. Our country has a shallow history of exchanges. Shanghai has been occupied, and how should the various shortcomings and immorality of black market transactions be renewed? It is really not easy. However, if we abandon this and do not plan, the foundation will not be established, and the consequences are worrying. But as the saying goes, knowing is difficult but not difficult, and it is necessary to constantly improve.</p>
<p>Second, the object of the transaction must be stabilized. There are many types of securities. Which one is beneficial to business investment, helpful to economic recovery, and effective in supporting industry and commerce? It is necessary to obtain its standards from the perspective of statistics with a far-sighted vision and a fair and just position. Then the inferior will not succeed, and the superior will be able to prosper. Here, we can't help but recall the United Kingdom again. In the 1690s, although stocks were issued, they failed to circulate in large quantities. In the next hundred years or so, more and more modernized enterprises emerged, stock investment became more and more popular, and exchange trading gradually focused on this. Its promotion of domestic production business is mutually reinforcing with the rise of the steam engine industry. However, the stock market is inevitably subject to frequent ups and downs. Multi-party and short-selling have been ups and downs, and the sacrifices are not small. The stock of the South Seas companies has been condemned by public opinion for its rise and plunge. In 1733, a law was enacted to strictly prohibit speculation. It can be seen that if the selection of the object of the transaction is not careful, the danger is like this. Although our country has a shallow history of exchanges, stock market trends have repeatedly occurred. We should not forget the rubber stocks in the late Qing Dynasty and the stock incident of this exchange around 1921. Those who preside over the stock exchange should know what to be vigilant about. As for public bonds, creditworthiness still needs to be strengthened, and circulation must be promoted. With the scarcity of our country's finances, if we abandon public bonds and focus on increasing taxes and issuing banknotes, it is not a good strategy. Therefore, for the sake of the entire nation, the stock exchange must do its best in public bond transactions. However, who should be responsible for the public bond trend at the end of June this year? To remove its drawbacks and establish its credibility, the stock exchange should give it a stern correction in the spirit of impartiality.</p>

<h3>The Reorganization of the Securities Industry Association</h3>
<p>— Jingzhi</p>
<p>The Securities Industry Association of this city, in November last year, was ordered by the Bureau of Social Affairs to reorganize according to law. Chen Yongqing, Mo Xinglin, Zhou Wusan, Fu Weiyuan, Zhu Muzhen, Zhu Taiyao, Ruan Gongchun and other seven people were appointed as reorganization committee members. Chen Yongqing was elected as the standing committee member, and he began to register members, draft articles of association, and submit them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. The first general meeting of members was convened on February 24 of this year. The articles of association were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. A total of fifteen people, including Du Yuesheng, Yu Mingshi, Mo Xinglin, Zhou Wusan, Chen Yongqing, Yu Mingyue, Lin Legeng, Yu Huanzheng, Su Peishao, Zhou Hanqing, Wang Shuhe, Lin Zongjing, Shi Jiucai, Wei Meizhang and Qiu Lianggui, were elected as directors. Zheng Xiaozhou, Dong Laisun, Zhu Wuyu, Wu Shishen, Ruan Gongchun, Fu Weiyuan, Zheng Xuegao and other seven people were elected as supervisors. They took office on the spot, and the first meeting of the board of directors was held on March 1. Du Yuesheng, Yu Mingshi, Wang Shuhe, Mo Xinglin, Shi Jiucai and other five people were elected as standing directors. Later, Du resigned due to illness. At the second meeting of the board of directors on March 28, it was resolved to approve the resignation and elect Yu Huanzheng as the standing director. Yu Huanzheng was elected as the chairman of the board from the standing directors. The reorganization committee members immediately handed over. As of recently, there were a total of 517 members of the association, of which 97 were elected as brokers.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Pseudo Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>— Old Man</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange officially opened today. We recalled the heavy inside story of the pseudo-stock exchange era, which is chilling. Under the leadership of several standing directors, the upper class followed suit and did their best to blackmail. Before the securities were listed, they had to campaign to the standing directors and pay a considerable price before they could obtain the listing election (only one or two were exceptions). After a heavy blackmail, it was not yet over. They also had to bribe the field affairs section with heavy profits (in addition to cash, there were also ways to give shares and distribute shares). Otherwise, the stock of this manufacturer would be in danger of being shelved (suspended on the upper floor on both sides of the market). Because of that place, it was inconvenient to buy and sell, and after a long time, it might become a cold stock or a moldy stock. At that time, as long as you look at that stock, moving from a remote place to a lively or central position, this stock must have something to do. At the same time, in front of this stock's sign, there must be a large number of surface gangs (small speculators who grab hats), and field affairs section members or other employees in the exchange. Speaking of surface gangs, they are really powerful. The pseudo exchange clearly stipulates that each broker is only allowed to send two agents to enter the market without any flexibility. However, these surface gangs can freely enter and exit the heavily guarded and strictly inspected market gate. Moreover, the legitimate agents are often unreasonably bullied by the field affairs section personnel, but the surface gangs can do whatever they want and take full advantage of it. It is nothing more than that money can make the world go round.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Its Business Evolution</h3>
<p>— Chen Xusun</p>
<p>The trading of securities in Shanghai truly began in the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, only a few firms acted as agents for buying and selling in other ports. Later, the number of practitioners gradually increased, but they each acted independently, limited by their narrow views. This led to the rubber stock craze, and the credibility of stocks was almost completely ruined. In the early years of the Republic of China, the industry organized the Stock Business Association, established articles of association, and cooperated with each other. Business developed daily, and the types of securities also gradually increased. Connections with the outside world also became increasingly close. The situation in all aspects could no longer tolerate the long-term closed-door approach. Therefore, in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the organization of Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Co., Ltd. was initiated, with a capital of three million yuan. In May of the ninth year, the approval from the Ministry was obtained, brokers were set up, and purely securities market transactions began. The existence of a formal market for securities trading in Shanghai is often considered to have started from this point. However, at that time, exchanges sprang up like mushrooms after rain, and the government had not yet issued unified laws and regulations, resulting in daily market prices being inconsistent and varying. The following year, the credit crunch occurred, and many exchanges in various industries went bankrupt. Fortunately, those who supported securities were able to cope in time, and this budding business was spared from external attacks, but still suffered a slight setback, and the share capital was reduced to one million. In the years that followed, due to political instability and frequent internal conflicts, the Qilu War, the Fengzhi War, and the 96 Incident directly and indirectly affected the existence of the securities market. It was not until the completion of the Northern Expedition and the promulgation of the Exchange Law and its implementing rules in the eighteenth year that the exchange had regulations to follow. According to the law, each type of exchange was limited to one per region, and those operating in the same type were required to merge within a specified period. At that time, there was still a securities and commodities exchange operating in the Shanghai securities market, which should have been merged according to the law. Until May of the second year, the securities portion of that exchange was merged into the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, and the capital was changed to 1.2 million yuan. The other parts were merged into specialized exchanges according to their types. From then on, the Shanghai securities market was legally unified, and all market prices were no longer inconsistent. The following year, the buildings were rebuilt, and the only complete securities market in the country was established. The company's reputation gradually increased, and the volume of transactions also increased daily. After that, after the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, bond prices plummeted, and the market was temporarily closed for a short period of time, but it was quickly restored. On August 13th of the 26th year, the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, and the closure of business was announced on the same day. At the same time, an order was received from the Ministry to prepare for moving to Wuhan. In November, personnel were sent to Wuhan to establish a preparatory office, but a market was never established. Until after the victory in the 34th year, the internal affairs of the exchange were reorganized. At the same time, it was felt that the stock market was closely related to the national financial policy and the Shanghai financial organization. In the spring of the 26th year, it was originally planned to increase capital and have various banks invest in order to seek close cooperation. Unfortunately, the war suddenly broke out and it could not be realized. In order to implement the old plans, in the spring of the 35th year, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly hired nine members to prepare for the organization of the Shanghai Securities Exchange. Stocks and bonds were operated separately, and the exchange was reorganized and named the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The capital was set at one billion yuan. In addition to the 600 million yuan invested by the Chinese Stock Exchange, the remaining 400 million yuan was undertaken by state-owned banks. The original market was expanded and renovated, and business began on September 9th of that year. This is a brief history of the Shanghai securities market. A brief discussion of the changes in its business is as follows:</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, there were no government bonds issued. In addition to those issued by foreign firms, there were only a few types of Chinese stocks, such as China Merchants Group and Hanyeping. Since there were few types, the turnover was small. After the founding of the Republic of China, industrial and commercial organizations gradually increased. However, those with large capital did not exceed several million yuan. The number of stocks was no more than tens of thousands of shares. After deducting the shares held by directors and supervisors, the number of shares in circulation was extremely small, and the managers were mostly limited by old habits and unwilling to assist the exchange. When asked, they could not get to the point. At the beginning of their investment, investors were introduced by relatives and friends, and they did not ask about the organization's content. Therefore, their personal finances were never used as a tool for financing their investments. On the one hand, they were ashamed to publicly entrust transactions, and on the other hand, there was a lack of publicly determined prices. The scope became narrower and narrower, and the circulation became smaller and smaller. On the contrary, foreign institutions were open about everything, transfers were convenient, and they were protected by extraterritorial rights. They established public associations with only twenty or thirty types, but the daily turnover was in the millions. The outflow of capital was truly regrettable! Since its establishment, the stock exchange has been constantly striving to change the investment concept of the Chinese people, but the result has been suspicion. From the 8th year of the Republic of China to the 26th year of the Republic of China, more than 98% of the securities traded on the stock exchange market were various government bonds. The government's credit gradually strengthened, and bond prices gradually stabilized, so the trading volume also gradually increased. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the government moved west, and Shanghai experienced abnormal prosperity. Many new industrial and commercial organizations emerged. In the 32nd year, the puppet organization forced the reopening of the market, specializing in the stocks of domestic companies. The turnover was quite large. As far as the exchange's own business is concerned, it has indeed opened up the old investment habits of our people, and its turning point cannot be ignored. The establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is more closely related to the financial community, and the current industrial and commercial organization procedures are more complete than before. All methods are public, and with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the public associations have also disintegrated. In the future, it will be easier for investors to choose where to go, and it will be possible to gradually improve the guidance of capital into the right path. Under strict management, the trading market will follow and move forward in order to fulfill its mission, and its work is truly difficult and great.</p>

<h3>Congratulations on the Reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>A stock exchange is a securities market. Securities are commodities, and where there are commodities, there must be buying and selling. Where there is buying and selling, there must be a market. An exchange is simply an organization that a country provides with certain regulations and a name when the market develops to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai Stock Exchange was legally organized, there was already a securities market. The market came first, and the exchange came later. Therefore, although the form of the exchange only became available after legal organization, the essence of the exchange can be said to be a natural product of the economy, and it is not related to laws and regulations. In other words, when the essential conditions are not yet in place, even if permitted by laws and regulations or promoted by artificial efforts, it may not be possible to run it successfully. Even if it is barely run, it may not be sustainable. The exchange laws and regulations have been promulgated for a long time. How many places in major cities in the country can run successfully? During the credit crunch frenzy in the tenth and eleventh years of the Republic of China, there were more than 140 kinds of exchanges in Shanghai, but how long did it last? It was a flash in the pan, and it never recovered. On the contrary, the public associations that specialized in Chinese and foreign stocks did not obtain the permission of our government, but before the January 28th Incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were always thriving and did not diminish due to the lack of legal conditions. As for the black market for various securities after the stock exchange was closed, it has not been completely eliminated until recently. During the period of occupation, the enemy and puppet institutions used their power to arbitrarily arrest and fine people, and prohibited newspapers from publishing market prices. After the victory, the ban was tightened, and even the telephone lines of the securities companies were cut off, but buying and selling still took place, and the market still existed. It can be seen that when the essential conditions for this market are not in place, there is no point in promoting or encouraging it. When the conditions are already in place and there is a real need, it cannot be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>We believe that the reorganization of the exchange and its reopening today is a natural measure. Because the establishment of the stock exchange market in this city is a matter of the , and there is indeed a need in the . If we adopt a negative policy and strictly prohibit , it will only turn public into private and prolong the life of this illegal black market trading.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to is that this market is particularly speculative, and its impact on general finance and commerce is also significant. Therefore, even today, some people still have doubts about this natural product of the economy. It was only after a long delay that a decision was made, and it was necessary to be cautious beforehand because of the excessive abuses.</p>
<p>The situation after the reorganization is obviously different from before in several aspects. (1) The amount of capital has been increased and it has been changed to a joint venture between the government and business. (2) The review of the brokerage association is very strict. (3) The margin is particularly high. (4) In addition to government bonds, stocks are given great importance. (5) Foreign firms are allowed to join as brokers. (4) and (5) can be said to be measures to adapt to the times, while (1), (2) and (3) are particularly important reforms this time.</p>
<p>However, according to past experience, every stock exchange frenzy is mostly due to human problems, and less due to legal problems. Speculation and manipulation of the market, driven by "bear syndicates", "bull syndicates", "large-scale pulling" and certain forces, has always been driven by such people. According to the results of the past regulatory system, it is obviously not enough to deal with these man-made disturbances. It seems that it is still worth considering how to learn from the past, strengthen supervision, and put the market on track and stabilize it.</p>
<p>Some people believe that speculative frenzies are mostly caused by futures trading. Therefore, they advocate prohibiting futures and limiting them to spot transactions. This is naturally a method of prevention and an effective means of preventing short selling. However, the duty of the exchange is to level market prices and regulate finance. The opening of futures trading has such a function. Although its trading object is securities, not goods, it seems that there is no relationship between production and sales, and there is no need to purchase raw materials on the one hand and sell products on the other to seek business stability. However, the most active way for the financial community to adjust its surplus and deficiency is to trade in valuable securities. Therefore, we also believe that there is room for further research on the point of only doing spot transactions and prohibiting term transactions. However, forward transactions are prone to abuse and should be restricted.</p>
<p>The advancement from a market to an exchange is originally the meaning of strengthening management and tightening the organization. The most ideal organization, of course, is to include all circulating securities and commercial firms operating securities within this institution in order to achieve the expected purpose, but this is not permitted in reality. Therefore, to eliminate speculation and stabilize the market, we must actually look beyond the exchange. Because the power of these external factors cannot be ignored, and sometimes it may affect the exchange and even affect the exchange. Therefore, the importance of this issue is not less than that of internal rectification. The measures that have been implemented, such as notifying stock companies to close down, prohibiting brokers from opening black markets, and prohibiting the use or installation of intercom telephones, are all appropriate measures to "resist foreign aggression and pacify the home". However, in order to thoroughly prevent abuses, we must always be vigilant and seek further progress. Where there is profit, people often disregard strict laws. Therefore, in addition to passive prevention, we must also pay attention to active guidance in order to reduce the power of the reaction.</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance, we finally achieved the final victory, and even more easily, we achieved the reopening of the stock exchange. Looking back and forth, I am willing to offer my humble opinions.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Securities Market Prices Over the Past Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Jiayou</p>
<p>The exchange business is most developed in Shanghai. However, when examining the earliest exchange in China, it should be the Beijing Stock Exchange in the seventh year of the Republic of China, followed by the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange in the eighth year of the Republic of China. At that time, Shanghai already had organizations such as the Stock Brokers Association and the Shanghai Public Association. Although their scope was smaller, their organization and methods already had the prototype of an exchange. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, Chinese joint-stock companies were not yet developed, and there were few trading chips. Therefore, it only focused on the exchange's own stocks, and it was unable to universally develop in promoting enterprises. Moreover, at that time, speculators in general had a craze for exchanges. Those that arose one after another were like bamboo shoots after a rain. According to statistics, there were more than 140 kinds of exchanges at that time, which was truly the heyday of exchanges. However, most of the operators at that time did not follow the right track, which led to serious abuses. They lost all aspects of facilitating buying and selling, supporting business, and circulating finance. On the contrary, they fostered gambling habits, short selling, disrupted real market prices, and shook the safety of the market, which was contrary to the true purpose of establishing an exchange. In the end, they suffered the disastrous consequences of the "credit crunch". This is indeed an interesting anecdote in the history of China's exchanges and a common lesson for operators today.</p>
<p>After the government promulgated the Exchange Law, stipulating that only one exchange could be established in a region for each category, the Securities and Commodities Exchange was also merged into the Chinese Securities Exchange in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. At the right time, the government issued government bonds, and the exchange limited its business to buying and selling government bonds to support its operations. It also restricted trading in its own shares to curb speculation. Targeting the previous shortcomings, the operation of the exchange gradually became regular under the supervision of the government. However, company stocks that helped corporate funding were not formally auctioned, which was not flexible enough for the financial market. Moreover, when the War of Resistance broke out, the exchange was again closed, which was a major blow to its development.</p>
<p>After the enemy and puppets controlled Shanghai, they flooded the market with counterfeit currency. The general public believed that counterfeit currency had no monetary value, and those who had capital were quite wary. In addition to trying every means to hoard materials, they also set up companies, factories, and other various businesses. Joint-stock companies gradually increased, and stock trading suddenly became a market. Therefore, the puppet government ordered the Chinese Stock Exchange to resume operations, creating an informal market for Chinese stocks. Some speculators, seeing the strict control of materials by the enemy and puppets, shifted their speculative targets to stocks. Moreover, at that time, the market prohibited government bonds and foreign stocks were also prohibited from public trading due to their hostile relationship. Therefore, the exchanges under the enemy and puppet organizations only traded in Chinese stocks. However, at that time, the operation of stocks was purely for speculative purposes, and it did not help the development and prosperity of industry and commerce, but disrupted financial changes.</p>
<p>In the year since the victory, the puppet exchanges have long been closed. Although there is no formal market for Chinese stock trading, it has become the target of speculators. Therefore, under the leadership of social leaders, economic authorities, and industrial and commercial leaders, in order to channel floating capital into the right track, encourage production, prosper the market, promote business, investment, promote economic recovery, establish a sound securities market, and support industrial and commercial enterprises, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the restoration of the Chinese Stock Exchange, which is scheduled to officially open on the 9th of this month. Its business types are stipulated to include (1) government bonds, (2) corporate bonds, and (3) stocks. It is also reported that stocks include both Chinese and foreign stocks, which must be strictly reviewed before they can be listed. Then, the securities market can be expected to move towards the right track. It is the most important meaning in economic recovery.</p>
<p>Now, the changes in the black market prices of securities over the past ten years are listed separately below for reference.</p>
<p>(A) Unified Government Bonds</p>

After Year 32, they were calculated in counterfeit currency "Central Reserve Bonds". From October of Year 34, they are all calculated in national currency.</p>
<p>(B) Foreign Stocks</p>

<p>Before Year 30, they were calculated in legal currency. After October of Year 34, they are all calculated in national currency.</p>
<p>(C) Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Note: Statistics for Year 31 are omitted due to changes in the currency system. Before Year 30, they were calculated in legal currency. After Year 32, they were calculated in counterfeit currency "Central Reserve Bonds". After October of Year 34, they are all calculated in national currency. Readers should pay attention to the changes in market prices between the various stocks due to the relationship between capital increases and decreases.</p>
